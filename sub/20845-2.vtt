WEBVTT

00:00.252 --> 00:03.254
The Carmichael Show is taped in
front of a live studio audience.

00:03.469 --> 00:06.610
Hey, Dad, Donald Trump is the president

00:06.611 --> 00:08.145
of the United States.

00:08.213 --> 00:10.781
That's crazy, right?

00:10.849 --> 00:12.716
I mean, it still looks like an ad

00:12.817 --> 00:15.052
for <i>The Apprentice</i> to me.

00:15.153 --> 00:16.453
Hey, Cordell.

00:16.521 --> 00:20.123
Tony... I see that salt and pepper

00:20.191 --> 00:21.658
in your hair, man.

00:21.726 --> 00:22.766
You gettin' up there, boy.

00:22.827 --> 00:24.394
Dad, how often do you come

00:24.495 --> 00:25.829
to this army recruiting center?

00:25.897 --> 00:27.308
Well, I come here about once a week.

00:27.332 --> 00:28.432
I like to drop off doughnuts,

00:28.499 --> 00:29.766
show my appreciation.

00:29.834 --> 00:31.768
You haven't taken Mom
on a date in six months,

00:31.836 --> 00:34.271
and you come here once a week?

00:34.339 --> 00:36.306
I bring your mama doughnuts, too.

00:38.176 --> 00:40.477
Wait a minute, is that Kevin Wilson?

00:40.545 --> 00:41.865
I didn't know he joined the army.

00:42.580 --> 00:43.357
Oh, you mean that kid
that lived down the block?

00:43.381 --> 00:45.616
Well, so it is.

00:45.683 --> 00:46.817
Well, give him a doughnut

00:46.885 --> 00:48.185
and thank him for his service.

00:48.286 --> 00:51.054
No. I don't like Kevin Wilson.

00:51.155 --> 00:52.289
None of us do.

00:52.357 --> 00:53.701
He's an arrogant bastard who used to

00:53.725 --> 00:54.805
beat Bobby up all the time.

00:54.859 --> 00:56.560
Okay, come on, man, I mean,

00:56.661 --> 00:58.295
we scrapped a few times here and there.

00:58.363 --> 00:59.840
You know, it was mostly fifty-fifty...

00:59.864 --> 01:00.941
he'll win some, and I'll win some.

01:00.965 --> 01:03.333
Oh, no, Bobby, you never won.

01:03.401 --> 01:04.678
Remember, you had to transfer schools

01:04.702 --> 01:05.836
just to get him to stop.

01:05.904 --> 01:08.338
Yeah, he did used to whup your ass.

01:08.406 --> 01:11.308
Well, I'm sure he's changed now.

01:11.376 --> 01:13.076
They're not gonna let some violent man

01:13.177 --> 01:15.345
who likes to bully
other people into the army.

01:15.413 --> 01:16.790
What are you talking about, Dad?
That has to be, like,

01:16.814 --> 01:19.216
75% of the army.

01:19.317 --> 01:21.318
He got my friend Stacy pregnant

01:21.386 --> 01:23.553
and has done nothing
to help raise that kid.

01:23.655 --> 01:26.189
He used to wear his sunglasses
on the back of his head.

01:26.257 --> 01:27.658
He drinks Monster Energy drinks.

01:27.725 --> 01:29.660
The man's a terrible person,
case closed.

01:29.727 --> 01:31.361
Yeah, well, he's a troop now.

01:31.429 --> 01:32.729
And those uniforms, they're like

01:32.830 --> 01:34.364
a cloak of forgiveness.

01:34.432 --> 01:36.333
Even the worst troop is better

01:36.401 --> 01:37.701
than the greatest civilian.

01:37.769 --> 01:39.703
If I were walking home tonight

01:39.771 --> 01:41.505
and I got jumped by a troop,

01:41.572 --> 01:44.708
I would be thankful I gave
him the extra training.

01:44.776 --> 01:46.343
Kevin.

01:46.411 --> 01:48.178
Mr. Carmichael.

01:50.581 --> 01:51.882
So, when'd you join the army?

01:51.950 --> 01:53.717
Just finished basic training last week.

01:53.785 --> 01:56.219
- Hey, Bobby.
- Hey, man. All right, quit playing.

01:58.532 --> 02:01.100
- Hey, Jerrod.
- Kevin.

02:01.201 --> 02:03.035
Thank you for your service.

02:03.103 --> 02:06.906
Yeah, yeah, yeah, thank
you for your service.

02:06.974 --> 02:08.184
I'm not thanking you for your service.

02:08.208 --> 02:10.776
You used to beat my brother up.

02:10.877 --> 02:13.045
This guy? We just always
used to have fun.

02:13.113 --> 02:14.447
No, you didn't.

02:14.548 --> 02:17.717
Look at his face;
he is terrified right now.

02:17.784 --> 02:21.787
No, I'm not. I'm cool.

02:21.889 --> 02:24.724
Jerrod, quit bringing up old bidness.

02:24.791 --> 02:28.761
Now, Kevin, I am proud of the
man that you have become.

02:28.829 --> 02:30.796
And we all know
you're gonna go out there

02:30.898 --> 02:33.599
and kill all the bad hombres
and make us proud.

02:35.469 --> 02:36.903
Thank you, Mr. Carmichael.

02:36.970 --> 02:38.571
You know, I just woke up one morning

02:38.639 --> 02:40.773
and felt there was a greater
calling for my life.

02:40.841 --> 02:43.809
I decided to join something
bigger than myself.

02:43.911 --> 02:45.778
I wake up before the sun rises

02:45.846 --> 02:47.991
just to get to work protecting
this country from threats

02:48.015 --> 02:49.615
you can't even imagine.

02:49.683 --> 02:51.584
You just completed basic training.

02:51.652 --> 02:54.954
You learned how to do
sit-ups and make the bed.

02:55.022 --> 02:57.623
I don't expect you to understand

02:57.691 --> 03:00.126
the type of responsibility
this takes, Jerrod,

03:00.194 --> 03:01.827
but you don't have to.

03:01.929 --> 03:04.096
Because there will always
be people like me

03:04.164 --> 03:05.932
to take care of people like you.

03:05.999 --> 03:08.935
Kevin, what's the real
reason you joined the army?

03:09.002 --> 03:11.938
Was it the easiest way to get
respect you don't deserve,

03:12.005 --> 03:13.683
or are you just trying
to avoid fatherhood?

03:13.707 --> 03:15.147
You don't have to answer him, Kevin.

03:15.175 --> 03:18.144
He is just a scrawny, rude civilian.

03:19.680 --> 03:21.614
It's cool, Mr. Carmichael.

03:21.682 --> 03:23.193
Jerrod, for starters, I joined because

03:23.217 --> 03:25.651
I love my country. Loves his country.

03:26.787 --> 03:28.654
And I wanted to give something back.

03:28.722 --> 03:29.789
Give something back.

03:29.856 --> 03:31.524
You know, make a sacrifice.

03:31.625 --> 03:34.160
Sacrifice!

03:34.228 --> 03:36.996
Daddy, it's like you're his hype man.

03:38.031 --> 03:40.800
Jerrod, no more disrespecting Kevin.

03:40.867 --> 03:42.501
Kevin is a good soldier

03:42.569 --> 03:44.704
on his way to achieving greatness.

03:44.805 --> 03:46.505
Now, thank him for his service

03:46.573 --> 03:48.474
and give this man a doughnut.

03:48.542 --> 03:50.042
Fine.

03:50.143 --> 03:53.813
Kevin, thank you for your service,

03:53.880 --> 03:56.649
you arrogant deadbeat dad.

03:56.717 --> 03:58.651
Hmm, um,

03:58.719 --> 04:01.153
cinnamon sugar or jelly?

Do you know how un-American
you are right now?

04:53.478 --> 04:55.411
Now, why don't you just
go up to Arlington

04:55.479 --> 04:57.881
and piss all over JFK's eternal flame?

04:57.948 --> 05:01.050
Cynthia... come on in here

05:01.118 --> 05:03.820
so we can shame Jerrod.

05:03.888 --> 05:05.054
What's going on?

05:05.156 --> 05:06.122
Joe, what happened?

05:06.223 --> 05:07.657
You remember Kevin Wilson,

05:07.725 --> 05:08.958
the boy that used to
live down the street?

05:08.978 --> 05:10.827
The same Kevin Wilson
that got my friend

05:10.895 --> 05:13.062
Stacy pregnant, and then
abandoned her and the baby.

05:13.130 --> 05:14.998
Oh, Kevin, he's the worst.

05:15.099 --> 05:17.667
I saw Stacy crying in the
mall just the other day

05:17.735 --> 05:20.737
'cause she couldn't afford
to buy her baby a pretzel.

05:20.805 --> 05:23.506
I wanted to help her, but
it was so sad and messy,

05:23.574 --> 05:26.976
I didn't want to get involved.

05:27.044 --> 05:29.913
Well, Kevin was the worst,
but now he joined the army.

05:29.980 --> 05:30.957
He's a troop now, Cynthia.

05:30.981 --> 05:32.715
Oh, Kevin is a troop now.

05:32.783 --> 05:35.919
Well, God bless him,
and God bless America.

05:35.986 --> 05:37.866
Wait, wait, wait,
weren't you just talking about

05:37.922 --> 05:40.190
how sad it was that his
poor, abandoned child

05:40.257 --> 05:41.658
couldn't get a pretzel?

05:41.725 --> 05:44.561
Kevin is fighting for
the country now, Maxine.

05:44.628 --> 05:46.729
I guess that pretzel is the sacrifice

05:46.797 --> 05:48.698
that baby had to make.

05:51.335 --> 05:54.337
Well, Mama, Jerrod refused

05:54.405 --> 05:57.040
to-to thank Kevin for his service.

05:57.107 --> 05:58.318
Instead, he cursed him out
in front of everybody.

05:58.342 --> 05:59.976
- It was crazy.
- No, no, no.

06:00.044 --> 06:02.145
I think it's crazier
that Bobby thanked him

06:02.246 --> 06:04.013
after Kevin used to
beat him up all the time.

06:04.081 --> 06:05.481
Look, Jerrod, everybody knows this.

06:05.549 --> 06:07.127
You have to thank a troop
for their service.

06:07.151 --> 06:08.495
That's just the way
you do things, okay?

06:08.519 --> 06:10.063
Look, let me tell you
what happened to me.

06:10.087 --> 06:13.022
Nekeisha slept with a Marine
last week, okay?

06:13.090 --> 06:16.392
As he was leaving,
I thanked him for his service.

06:22.233 --> 06:25.168
You did the right thing, Bobby.

06:25.236 --> 06:27.503
Be patriotic.

06:27.571 --> 06:29.105
Well, maybe it's my fault

06:29.173 --> 06:30.907
that I let you boys
form your own opinions

06:30.975 --> 06:32.118
when I should have been
ramming my opinions

06:32.142 --> 06:33.743
down your throat.

06:33.811 --> 06:36.880
Should have seen this coming
when you got suspended

06:36.947 --> 06:39.082
from elementary school
for refusing to say

06:39.149 --> 06:40.450
the Pledge of Allegiance.

06:40.517 --> 06:43.353
It is ridiculous to ask a kid

06:43.420 --> 06:44.854
to pledge allegiance to anything.

06:44.922 --> 06:46.789
They wanted me
to vow loyalty to a country

06:46.857 --> 06:49.893
six months after I found out
Santa Claus wasn't real.

06:51.662 --> 06:53.730
This is America we're talking about.

06:53.797 --> 06:55.298
It's not like we ask you to say

06:55.366 --> 06:57.634
the Pledge of Allegiance
to some crappy country

06:57.701 --> 06:59.168
like Slovakia.

06:59.236 --> 07:00.737
That would be ridiculous.

07:00.804 --> 07:04.207
I mean, I don't even think
they got a pledge in Slovakia.

07:04.275 --> 07:07.877
If I lived in Slovakia,
I'd kill myself.

07:10.014 --> 07:12.148
Joe, you can't call Jerrod unpatriotic

07:12.216 --> 07:14.117
just because he didn't thank some guy

07:14.184 --> 07:15.885
who sounds like a real jerk.

07:15.953 --> 07:17.520
And I love that Jerrod

07:17.588 --> 07:19.989
didn't pledge allegiance
to the flag when he was a kid.

07:20.057 --> 07:22.125
I think the most patriotic
thing an American can do

07:22.192 --> 07:23.860
is question authority.

07:23.928 --> 07:27.263
Well, I think the most American
thing for Americans to do

07:27.331 --> 07:29.232
is to shut up and do
what the American leaders

07:29.300 --> 07:31.801
tell them to do.

07:31.869 --> 07:32.936
Jerrod,

07:33.037 --> 07:35.939
by not thanking Kevin for his service,

07:36.006 --> 07:39.008
you have spit in the face
of all the brave men and women

07:39.076 --> 07:42.412
who are at war right now
fighting for your freedom.

07:42.479 --> 07:43.924
You don't even know what
you're talking about.

07:43.948 --> 07:45.859
Do you even know who
we're at war with right now?

07:45.883 --> 07:48.918
Of course I know who we're at war with!

07:48.986 --> 07:52.388
Iraq, Iran, um...

07:52.489 --> 07:53.623
Eurasia.

07:55.793 --> 07:57.771
I'm pretty sure we got some boys
over there in Pakistan

07:57.795 --> 07:59.095
and that Afghanistan.

07:59.163 --> 08:00.323
You got to watch them 'stans.

08:00.364 --> 08:02.565
Them 'stans will sneak up on you.

08:02.666 --> 08:04.167
Oh, Daddy, what about Aleppo?

08:04.234 --> 08:05.545
There's something going on in Aleppo.

08:05.569 --> 08:06.736
Oh, yeah, Aleppo, too.

08:06.804 --> 08:08.444
We got a lot of bad guys
we got to get out

08:08.505 --> 08:09.906
of that Aleppo right now.

08:10.007 --> 08:13.209
Oh, yeah, I think
we're gonna have to just

08:13.277 --> 08:14.711
wipe out Aleppo completely

08:14.778 --> 08:16.279
and, uh, start over.

08:16.347 --> 08:17.981
I mean, uh, it's a shame,

08:18.048 --> 08:20.016
but we got to do it.

08:28.492 --> 08:31.828
You know, it's fine to
just say "I don't know."

08:32.962 --> 08:34.931
It don't matter who we're at war with.

08:34.999 --> 08:37.200
Just know they had it coming. What?!

08:37.267 --> 08:39.102
They had it coming?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

08:39.169 --> 08:41.738
Did you forget that we
invaded Iraq over a lie?

08:41.839 --> 08:43.139
Oh, please, spare me the

08:43.207 --> 08:46.576
"we invaded Iraq over a lie" nonsense.

08:46.643 --> 08:48.745
I told you why we went!

08:48.812 --> 08:50.947
Iraq had oil.

08:51.015 --> 08:54.817
Now, these terrorists were gonna
do bad things with that oil.

08:54.885 --> 08:56.352
So we had to go over there,

08:56.420 --> 08:58.554
stop them, get the oil,

08:58.622 --> 08:59.856
and return the oil to freedom.

08:59.923 --> 09:01.391
Mission accomplished.

09:06.196 --> 09:07.807
Look, America does a lot
of terrible things,

09:07.831 --> 09:10.133
but we'll never improve as a country

09:10.200 --> 09:13.803
if we get called un-American
every time we criticize it.

09:13.871 --> 09:15.638
You know, when I was in college,

09:15.706 --> 09:18.641
I made a point that we shouldn't
celebrate Columbus Day anymore

09:18.709 --> 09:20.420
because of all the terrible
things that Columbus did

09:20.444 --> 09:22.245
to the Native Americans,

09:22.312 --> 09:25.848
and then someone spray-painted
the word "Communist" on my car.

09:25.916 --> 09:27.517
Good. They should've slashed your tires

09:27.584 --> 09:28.885
while they were there.

09:28.986 --> 09:30.753
Look, Maxine,

09:30.854 --> 09:32.255
it was either the Native Americans

09:32.356 --> 09:34.424
or the real Americans;
one of them had to go.

09:34.525 --> 09:37.360
Yeah, and we took all of their land,

09:37.428 --> 09:40.329
but we named a lot of
our sports teams after them,

09:40.397 --> 09:42.231
and I think that's nice.

09:44.068 --> 09:48.738
Look, does this country have
a history of doing evil things?

09:48.806 --> 09:50.139
Of course.

09:50.207 --> 09:52.475
But there is a necessary evil.

09:52.543 --> 09:53.810
And that has led us to being

09:53.911 --> 09:55.578
the greatest nation in the world.

09:55.679 --> 09:58.581
Okay, but, Dad, you can't just excuse

09:58.649 --> 10:00.349
all of America's injustices.

10:00.417 --> 10:02.785
I mean, do I need to bring up
the elephant in the room?

10:02.853 --> 10:03.953
We are black.

10:04.021 --> 10:06.556
Oh... there it is.

10:09.393 --> 10:11.594
Now you done played the slavery card.

10:11.662 --> 10:13.496
Dad, it's not a card, all right?

10:13.564 --> 10:15.298
It's a real thing that happened.

10:15.399 --> 10:16.843
I just think, when it comes to slavery,

10:16.867 --> 10:18.201
you need to see the big picture.

10:18.302 --> 10:19.735
Dad, are...

10:19.803 --> 10:21.571
are you about
to defend slavery right now?

10:24.341 --> 10:26.275
Joe?

10:26.343 --> 10:27.777
Daddy?

10:27.845 --> 10:30.580
I am not defending slavery.

10:30.647 --> 10:34.317
Slavery is the darkest shame
on the history of America.

10:34.384 --> 10:36.329
Oh, good, thank God. Whew. Took
a turn there for a minute.

10:36.353 --> 10:37.320
Yeah, I was worried.

10:37.387 --> 10:39.422
- However...
- Uh-oh.

10:41.058 --> 10:42.758
...let me just say this.

10:42.860 --> 10:45.795
If it hadn't been for slavery,
we'd still be in Africa.

10:47.331 --> 10:49.832
Probably starving to death.

10:49.900 --> 10:51.834
Probably wind up on one
of them infomercials

10:51.902 --> 10:53.870
begging some family from Ohio

10:53.937 --> 10:57.640
to sponsor us for 98 cents a day.

10:58.542 --> 11:00.510
What... what kind of food

11:00.577 --> 11:03.779
can you get for 98 cents a day?

11:03.847 --> 11:06.048
What are we sending
them, a pack of gum?

11:06.116 --> 11:07.416
Uh-oh, Jerrod?

11:07.484 --> 11:08.651
Kevin just pulled up outside.

11:08.719 --> 11:10.486
What is he doing here?

11:10.554 --> 11:14.257
Well, Jerrod offended him,
and he's come for revenge.

11:14.324 --> 11:17.326
Now, the parent in me
wants to protect you,

11:17.394 --> 11:19.529
but the patriot in me is
thinking you probably deserve

11:19.630 --> 11:20.863
what you're about to get.

11:22.366 --> 11:24.133
Joe, he's going into his trunk.

11:24.201 --> 11:25.735
What if he's got a gun?

11:25.802 --> 11:27.803
Oh, no, he's just
putting his coat away.

11:29.373 --> 11:30.840
J-Jerrod, you'd better hide, okay?

11:30.908 --> 11:33.609
Kevin fought like a soldier
in middle school.

11:33.710 --> 11:35.711
Okay, should we be nervous?

11:35.779 --> 11:38.281
- Sorry to intrude, Mr. Carmichael.
- Ha-ha! Kevin!

11:39.416 --> 11:41.050
Come on in, come on in.

11:41.151 --> 11:42.304
Listen, Kevin, I know my son

11:42.305 --> 11:43.872
is a coward, and I should step aside

11:43.940 --> 11:45.640
and let you punch him in the face,

11:45.708 --> 11:46.942
but just know this...

11:47.043 --> 11:50.012
I have just lectured
him on the importance

11:50.079 --> 11:51.880
of loving his country

11:51.948 --> 11:54.549
and supporting all
the brave men and women

11:54.617 --> 11:55.951
who are sacrificing for us

11:56.019 --> 11:58.553
in all branches of the Armed Forces.

11:58.621 --> 12:00.989
Mr. Carmichael, I'm actually
the one here to apologize.

12:01.090 --> 12:02.624
Hello, Mrs. Carmichael.

12:02.692 --> 12:05.994
Hello, Kevin. Thank you
for not murdering my son.

12:06.963 --> 12:09.631
I wanted to talk to you, Bobby.

12:09.699 --> 12:10.932
I just want to say I'm sorry.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.768
I never saw myself as a bully,

12:12.869 --> 12:14.403
but I thought about what Jerrod said

12:14.470 --> 12:17.672
and I apologize if I ever
did anything to hurt you.

12:18.808 --> 12:21.510
Thank you, Kevin. That means a lot.

12:21.577 --> 12:25.113
Just when I thought this man
couldn't get more heroic.

12:28.251 --> 12:31.253
And, Jerrod, no hard feelings
about the way you acted.

12:31.354 --> 12:34.256
Oh, no, Kevin,
I thought about it and...

12:34.357 --> 12:35.768
completely cool with the way I acted.

12:35.792 --> 12:37.692
Kevin, I couldn't be more proud of you

12:37.760 --> 12:39.561
if you were my own son.

12:39.629 --> 12:41.163
And if there is anything

12:41.230 --> 12:43.799
I can do while you are over there

12:43.866 --> 12:45.734
fighting for your country,
just name it.

12:45.802 --> 12:47.035
I appreciate that.

12:47.103 --> 12:49.371
Just name it, Kevin,
and I will claim it.

12:49.472 --> 12:53.842
Because Joe Franklin Carmichael
supports the troops.

12:53.910 --> 12:56.278
Well, there is one thing I need.

12:56.345 --> 12:57.923
I'm being deployed
to Afghanistan tomorrow

12:57.947 --> 13:00.282
and I haven't been able to
find someone to watch my dog

13:00.349 --> 13:01.716
while I'm gone.

13:01.784 --> 13:03.585
Ooh, a dog?

13:03.653 --> 13:05.654
Ooh, a dog sounds fun.

13:05.721 --> 13:07.222
Hi, I'm Maxine; no one introduced me

13:07.290 --> 13:10.525
'cause they were afraid
you were here to kill Jerrod.

13:10.593 --> 13:12.127
Joe, tell him we are not dog people.

13:12.195 --> 13:13.829
We're not into dogs like that.

13:13.896 --> 13:15.797
Oh, don't worry about it.

13:15.865 --> 13:16.932
I know it's a big ask.

13:16.999 --> 13:18.533
No, no, no, no, no, Kevin,

13:18.601 --> 13:21.369
there's not an ask too big
when it comes to my dad,

13:21.437 --> 13:24.539
especially with the military.

13:24.607 --> 13:26.741
In fact, before you got here,
he was just lecturing us

13:26.843 --> 13:28.523
on the importance of
supporting the troops.

13:28.578 --> 13:30.145
Ain't that right, Dad?

13:30.246 --> 13:32.647
Man, it would mean a
lot knowing Lincoln

13:32.715 --> 13:34.116
was safe while I'm gone.

13:34.183 --> 13:35.550
This dog is my heart.

13:35.618 --> 13:37.619
Lincoln? Your dog's name is Lincoln?

13:37.720 --> 13:39.020
That is a patriotic name.

13:39.088 --> 13:40.222
What type of dog is it?

13:40.289 --> 13:42.257
Golden Retriever.

13:42.325 --> 13:43.492
Dad...

13:43.559 --> 13:45.193
a Golden Retriever.

13:49.198 --> 13:51.833
Kevin, it would be my honor
to watch your dog.

13:51.901 --> 13:53.435
Oh, seriously? Thanks, Mr. Carmichael.

13:53.536 --> 13:55.270
You saved me.

13:55.338 --> 13:57.172
The six months will fly by, I promise.

13:58.875 --> 14:00.876
I'll go get him out the
car so you can meet him.

14:01.844 --> 14:04.279
Joe, are you crazy?

14:04.380 --> 14:05.947
Yeah, Daddy, you hate dogs.

14:06.015 --> 14:07.359
Yeah, but we've never had a dog before.

14:07.383 --> 14:09.084
Because we hate them!

14:11.020 --> 14:13.688
We ain't gonna have a
problem with this dog.

14:13.756 --> 14:15.924
We're just gonna serve our country

14:15.992 --> 14:19.561
and protect Kevin's dog 'cause
it's the right thing to do.

14:22.398 --> 14:23.999
Oh, God, he's hideous.

14:28.146 --> 14:30.080
Joe, I'm
coming down the stairs.

14:30.081 --> 14:32.533
- Is the dog tied up?
- He don't need to be tied up.

14:32.534 --> 14:34.068
Joe, put the dog outside.

14:34.169 --> 14:36.237
You know I can't stand
dogs in my house.

14:36.338 --> 14:38.072
He's not an outside dog, Cyn.

14:38.173 --> 14:41.409
Kevin said, "This is
not an outside dog."

14:41.477 --> 14:44.879
It's an outside dog
if you put it outside.

14:46.682 --> 14:50.184
You can't turn an inside dog
into an outside dog.

14:50.252 --> 14:53.221
That's like gay conversion therapy.

14:53.288 --> 14:57.225
You just need to accept
him the way he is.

14:57.292 --> 15:02.096
Joe, there is a spirit inside
this dog that just is not right.

15:02.197 --> 15:04.232
Last night while we were making love,

15:04.299 --> 15:06.534
he came inside the room and watched us.

15:09.104 --> 15:12.273
And his eyes rolled up
in the back of his head.

15:12.341 --> 15:15.243
Well, next time,
we'll just close the door.

15:15.310 --> 15:17.645
Well, he's just gonna
sit outside and listen!

15:19.615 --> 15:21.616
So what if he listens?
He can't tell nobody

15:21.717 --> 15:24.252
'cause he's just a damn dog.

15:24.319 --> 15:26.954
Joe, I can't believe that
you are doing this.

15:27.056 --> 15:29.223
We had a happy home until

15:29.291 --> 15:32.460
you brought this evil,
perverted dog up in here.

15:32.561 --> 15:34.462
I don't want him here, either.

15:34.563 --> 15:36.931
I'm just trying to prove
a point to Jerrod.

15:36.999 --> 15:39.934
I-I'd rather this dog maul
both me and you

15:40.002 --> 15:43.104
than have that lanky bastard
thinking he's right.

15:45.074 --> 15:46.074
What if Kevin dies?

15:46.141 --> 15:48.443
Are we gonna be stuck
with this dog forever?

15:48.510 --> 15:53.281
Well, if Kevin dies,
then we put the dog outside.

15:54.650 --> 15:58.653
Hey. So, how are things
going with the dog?

15:58.754 --> 16:01.622
Oh, we love this dog.

16:01.690 --> 16:04.425
That is not a dog. That is a demon.

16:04.493 --> 16:07.495
That has a demon's spirit,
and I want it out of my house!

16:07.596 --> 16:09.764
Well, your mama's taking a little time

16:09.832 --> 16:11.499
to get used to the dog,

16:11.600 --> 16:15.436
but we're gonna have a good time
with this dog, I can tell.

16:15.504 --> 16:18.106
Oh, Joe!

16:18.173 --> 16:19.350
You're letting him lick
all on your face.

16:19.374 --> 16:21.509
It makes me just want to throw up!

16:21.610 --> 16:24.011
Well, I can't help how the dog choose

16:24.113 --> 16:25.446
to show his damn love, Cynthia.

16:25.514 --> 16:26.394
- Oh...
- Dad, you know

16:26.815 --> 16:27.348
you don't have to keep this dog

16:27.416 --> 16:28.316
if you don't want to.

16:28.383 --> 16:30.184
This is what loving your country

16:30.285 --> 16:32.553
looks like, Jerrod.

16:32.654 --> 16:34.288
Dad, just admit it.

16:34.356 --> 16:36.167
You're not doing this
because you love the troops;

16:36.191 --> 16:37.535
you're only doing it
to prove a point to me.

16:37.559 --> 16:38.837
This really isn't about you, Jerrod.

16:38.861 --> 16:41.496
This is about the brave men and women

16:41.563 --> 16:43.531
who are fighting for our freedom.

16:43.632 --> 16:45.500
I am a proud American.

16:45.567 --> 16:48.669
I will do anything I can
to support the troops.

16:48.737 --> 16:50.638
Hey, y'all. I've been calling you.

16:50.706 --> 16:52.173
Why you ain't pick up the phone?

16:52.241 --> 16:53.407
We had to unplug the phone.

16:54.676 --> 16:57.116
Every time it rings, we have to
give this dog an anxiety pill,

16:57.179 --> 16:59.680
and they cost $75 a bottle.

16:59.748 --> 17:02.049
Well, I was trying to tell you
about Bobby.

17:02.151 --> 17:03.317
What about Bobby?

17:03.385 --> 17:05.051
He went to join the army. What?

17:05.154 --> 17:06.554
Oh, no, my baby!

17:06.655 --> 17:09.357
He's too frail for military life.

17:09.424 --> 17:11.559
And he's definitely the type
to get PTSD.

17:11.660 --> 17:13.361
He already screams in his sleep now,

17:13.428 --> 17:16.531
and that's just
if he ate something spicy.

17:16.598 --> 17:18.242
We're not gonna let him
do this to himself.

17:18.267 --> 17:20.145
Wait a minute, what happened
to loving the military

17:20.169 --> 17:21.536
and supporting the troops?

17:21.603 --> 17:23.204
Well, that's what
the doughnuts are for.

17:23.271 --> 17:25.740
They make us feel less guilty
knowing we never had to

17:25.840 --> 17:27.708
make any real sacrifices ourselves.

17:27.776 --> 17:29.844
Look, everybody has a limit.

17:29.912 --> 17:32.046
And my limit is
taking care of that creepy dog.

17:32.114 --> 17:34.248
There, I said it. You happy now?

17:34.349 --> 17:37.718
Actually, yeah,
it's incredibly fulfilling.

17:37.786 --> 17:39.587
Joe, go bring my baby home.

17:39.688 --> 17:42.723
I will. He got friendly fire
written all over him.

17:46.395 --> 17:47.762
Bobby.

17:47.863 --> 17:49.197
Daddy?

17:49.264 --> 17:50.765
Bobby, what are you thinking?

17:50.866 --> 17:52.400
What are you guys doing here?

17:52.467 --> 17:54.402
We came here to tell you
that joining the army

17:54.469 --> 17:56.604
is the biggest mistake you
gonna make in your life.

17:56.705 --> 17:58.416
Dad, why are you telling me
I'm making a mistake?

17:58.440 --> 18:00.185
You didn't tell Kevin
he was making a mistake.

18:00.209 --> 18:02.743
Okay, I see. I know
you're looking at Kevin

18:02.811 --> 18:05.246
thinking he's a hero,
thinking you can be one, too.

18:05.314 --> 18:08.583
But heroes need regular people to save.

18:08.650 --> 18:12.386
Bobby, you are not Kevin, okay?

18:12.454 --> 18:15.256
I don't even like him,
but he's built like a soldier

18:15.324 --> 18:17.291
and you are built like...

18:17.392 --> 18:20.428
someone made for customer service.

18:20.495 --> 18:23.598
Look here, okay?
I'm not trying to be like Kevin.

18:23.665 --> 18:24.765
Then why are you here?

18:24.833 --> 18:26.467
- Because of you.
- What?

18:26.568 --> 18:27.768
Look, growing up,

18:27.836 --> 18:29.637
I always wanted to make you proud.

18:29.738 --> 18:32.473
And it seemed like it
never happened, not even once.

18:32.574 --> 18:34.442
And I see the way you look at Kevin

18:34.509 --> 18:36.444
and all these soldiers around here.

18:36.511 --> 18:38.246
And I realized this was my opportunity

18:38.313 --> 18:39.824
to become the son
that you always wanted

18:39.848 --> 18:41.315
and make you proud.

18:41.416 --> 18:44.452
Bobby, why are you
wasting so much damn time

18:44.519 --> 18:46.454
trying to make me proud?

18:46.521 --> 18:48.456
That's why you never
accomplished anything.

18:48.523 --> 18:49.824
Look at your brother.

18:49.925 --> 18:52.760
He don't give a damn
what I think about him.

18:52.828 --> 18:54.595
He's right. I don't.

18:54.663 --> 18:56.908
In fact, I usually ask myself
"What would make Dad proud?"

18:56.932 --> 18:59.500
- Then I just do the opposite.
- See?

18:59.601 --> 19:02.303
And that makes me feel ashamed of him.

19:02.371 --> 19:03.938
We got a thing and it works.

19:04.006 --> 19:06.941
But I love the way
you talk about this country.

19:07.009 --> 19:09.277
It just makes me want to be
a better American.

19:09.344 --> 19:12.680
I do love this country,
but I don't trust your life

19:12.781 --> 19:14.649
in the hands of this government.

19:14.716 --> 19:16.784
I love you too much.

19:16.852 --> 19:18.185
Now, look,

19:18.287 --> 19:20.488
I know you're looking around this room,

19:20.555 --> 19:22.657
seeing all these posters,
getting all hyped up

19:22.724 --> 19:24.825
and inspired,
thinking you can do anything.

19:24.893 --> 19:26.160
But you can't.

19:26.228 --> 19:28.496
You wasn't made for the battlefield!

19:28.563 --> 19:31.465
Look at this man.
This is your president.

19:31.533 --> 19:35.670
I voted for him and
even I know he's crazy.

19:35.737 --> 19:37.338
There are gonna be so many wars.

19:37.406 --> 19:38.673
You could die out there.

19:38.740 --> 19:40.841
And so could all these
people up in here, too!

19:40.909 --> 19:42.677
And for what? Nothing!

19:42.744 --> 19:46.347
Everybody's gonna die for nothing!

19:49.318 --> 19:52.687
We-we, um, we're just gonna
get out of here. Uh...

19:52.754 --> 19:55.489
thank you guys for your service.
Thank you for your service.

19:55.557 --> 19:57.658
Thank you for... Cordell, is it?

19:57.726 --> 20:00.761
Thank you for your service,
Cordell. All right.

20:08.310 --> 20:10.127
All across America,

20:10.128 --> 20:14.031
helpless animals are
brutalized and cast aside,

20:14.098 --> 20:19.436
condemned by their abusers
to a life of agony and pain.

20:19.504 --> 20:21.905
But for just 20 cents a day,

20:22.006 --> 20:25.575
you can help end their suffering.

20:25.677 --> 20:28.345
You can save their lives.

20:28.413 --> 20:31.014
Don't ignore these victims' cries.

20:31.082 --> 20:35.552
Call now and be a hero
to an innocent animal today.

20:45.063 --> 20:48.098
Don't you worry.
Don't you worry at all, Lincoln.

20:48.199 --> 20:51.702
I'm gonna save you, okay?

20:51.769 --> 20:54.404
You are coming home with me.

20:54.505 --> 20:56.573
Lincoln, look at me.

20:56.674 --> 20:59.242
I'll be your hero.
