00:12.303 --> 00:14.764
{\an3}I can't believe 12 hours
ago they were dancing

00:14.848 --> 00:16.306
{\an3}and now they're
in intensive care.

00:16.391 --> 00:20.103
{\an1}David, Kelly's not in
intensive care anymore.

00:20.186 --> 00:21.438
Well, she's in
the burn unit.

00:21.521 --> 00:23.231
{\an3}That seems pretty
intense to me.

00:23.314 --> 00:26.776
{\an1}You know, I had
a first-degree burn once.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.987
{\an3}Donna, that's
like a sunburn.

00:29.070 --> 00:30.488
Maybe it was
a second-degree burn.

00:30.572 --> 00:32.323
I don't know.
It was from an iron.

00:32.406 --> 00:34.284
It hurt like hell.

00:37.036 --> 00:39.414
{\an3}Don't worry Brandon,
Kelly's gonna be okay.

00:43.752 --> 00:45.336
No offense, Donna,

00:45.420 --> 00:48.548
but I really need to hear that
from the doctor.

00:55.555 --> 00:57.974

01:24.584 --> 01:26.586

01:44.854 --> 01:46.564

02:00.161 --> 02:01.329

02:01.412 --> 02:03.373
the city's not gonna
drop these charges.

02:03.456 --> 02:05.458
They're gonna want someone to
pay for the emergency services,

02:05.542 --> 02:07.836
{\an1}the fire trucks
and what have you.

02:07.919 --> 02:09.920
{\an3}Ted Stone is gonna
take care of that one.

02:10.003 --> 02:12.215
This time, he's the one with
the deep pocket here, not me.

02:12.298 --> 02:13.591
{\an1}Ted is aware
of what he has to do.

02:13.675 --> 02:15.343
{\an1}But none of this
is gonna work

02:15.426 --> 02:17.345
{\an1}unless he acts in concert
with his son.

02:17.428 --> 02:19.556
Okay, thank you.

02:19.639 --> 02:23.226
What's the word?

02:23.309 --> 02:25.436
No change.

02:25.520 --> 02:29.065
{\an3}Take it easy, kid.
We'll get through this.

02:29.149 --> 02:32.318
Yeah, I just hope Kelly will.

02:32.402 --> 02:36.281
{\an1}Look, if Steve
and Griffin plead no contest

02:36.364 --> 02:39.409
to a Section 415, say,
disturbing the peace,

02:39.492 --> 02:41.911
{\an1}they can do a few hours
of community service,

02:41.995 --> 02:44.080
{\an1}and put the whole thing
behind them.

02:44.163 --> 02:45.498
We've still got to deal

02:45.582 --> 02:46.583
{\an3}with this personal injury
thing, you said, right?

02:46.666 --> 02:48.209
{\an1}You let us
take care of that.

02:48.293 --> 02:49.419
{\an3}A little tough with her
being in critical condition.

02:49.502 --> 02:52.463
No, what's gonna be tough
is if she doesn't pull through.

02:52.547 --> 02:54.132
{\an1}That's why
we gotta move fast.

02:54.215 --> 02:57.010
Now can we count
on you or not?!

03:03.850 --> 03:04.893
Do what you gotta do.

03:08.062 --> 03:15.486
{\an5}WOMAN (over P.A.):
Dr. Freeman, extension 4832.
Dr. Freeman, extension 4832.

03:34.422 --> 03:37.300
{\an5}MAN (over P.A.):
Dr. Myra Goldstein,
please report to Reception.

03:37.383 --> 03:41.179
Dr. Myra Goldstein, please
report to Reception.

03:57.362 --> 03:58.321
Where's Alison?

03:58.404 --> 04:00.365
She's right down the hall,
honey.

04:00.448 --> 04:02.033
(sighs)

04:02.116 --> 04:03.868
She was in the fire with me.

04:03.952 --> 04:05.453
Is she okay?

04:05.536 --> 04:06.371
Well, when you're feeling
better,

04:06.454 --> 04:07.497
you can go see for yourself.

04:11.584 --> 04:13.711
{\an1}We are so fortunate
that other girl, Alison,

04:13.795 --> 04:15.338
{\an1}she's going to need
numerous skin grafts.

04:15.421 --> 04:16.255
And even then,

04:16.339 --> 04:18.341
{\an1}she'll be scarred for life,
on her face yet.

04:18.423 --> 04:20.134
Here it is.

04:20.218 --> 04:22.136
But Kelly's gonna be
okay, though, right?

04:22.220 --> 04:23.972
Mm, so far so good.

04:24.055 --> 04:26.849
The doctor wouldn't promise
anything, but he's hopeful

04:26.933 --> 04:29.602
that with luck, you won't really
be able to tell, in most places.

04:29.686 --> 04:30.979
Can I see her?

04:31.062 --> 04:33.314
{\an1}Yeah, she's been asking
for you. Go on in.

04:40.405 --> 04:42.865
I was trying to come up
with some kind of joke,

04:42.949 --> 04:45.159
but somehow...

04:45.243 --> 04:48.830
{\an1}I'm not exactly stand-up
material, I know.

04:50.957 --> 04:53.751
{\an6}Your mom says
you're gonna be
perfect real soon.

04:53.835 --> 04:55.628
What does she know?

04:57.130 --> 04:58.589
I'm really sorry, Kel.

05:00.633 --> 05:02.593
It wasn't your fault.

05:02.677 --> 05:05.722
I just don't like to see you
in pain like this.

05:05.805 --> 05:09.142
Mm, to tell you the truth,

05:09.225 --> 05:11.352
I can't really feel
much of anything.

05:11.436 --> 05:14.522
{\an1}They gave me
some pretty powerful stuff.

05:14.605 --> 05:16.733
{\an3}You know, none of this
would have happened

05:16.816 --> 05:18.359
if I would have been there.

05:20.528 --> 05:21.529
Where were you, again?

05:21.612 --> 05:23.573
I was at the airport.

05:23.656 --> 05:25.825
Oh, right.

05:25.908 --> 05:26.951
Did Emily get off okay?

05:27.035 --> 05:28.161
(door opens)

05:30.329 --> 05:32.415
She needs to rest now.

05:32.498 --> 05:35.043
Okay.

05:35.126 --> 05:36.586
I'll be back.

05:37.503 --> 05:38.880
You get some sleep.

05:51.100 --> 05:53.061
{\an5}STEVE:
Eduardo, what are you
doing here?

05:53.144 --> 05:56.272
I know you are very busy,
and I'm sorry to bother you,

05:56.355 --> 05:59.275
but can you please pay me
for last night?

05:59.358 --> 06:00.401
{\an1}You got
impeccable timing, man.

06:00.485 --> 06:02.445
{\an3}Hey, I had to buy
all the food!

06:02.528 --> 06:03.321
Yeah, well,

06:03.404 --> 06:04.822
my oldest friend
is in the hospital!

06:04.906 --> 06:06.282
I gotta deal
with a lot of problems.

06:06.365 --> 06:08.117
I don't need you
breathing down my neck!

06:08.201 --> 06:11.120
Hey, if you don't have it,

06:11.204 --> 06:12.371
{\an3}it's okay.

06:12.455 --> 06:16.084
Do you have any idea how far in
the hole I am from this thing?

06:16.167 --> 06:18.461
{\an1}Do you know how much equipment
got destroyed last night?!

06:18.544 --> 06:20.129
I can't even think straight!

06:20.213 --> 06:21.255
You need money so bad,

06:21.339 --> 06:22.423
{\an1}here!

06:22.507 --> 06:25.301
Hey, I don't need it that bad!

06:27.887 --> 06:31.808
Whoa! What's his problem?

06:31.891 --> 06:33.476
I don't know.

06:33.559 --> 06:35.478
{\an3}I'm gonna take
a shower.

06:35.561 --> 06:37.271
{\an1}Hey, about those citations
we got,

06:37.355 --> 06:38.314
I just want you to know

06:38.397 --> 06:39.982
{\an1}my dad's gonna take care
of everything.

06:40.066 --> 06:41.275
You think so?

06:41.359 --> 06:42.652
I know so.
Don't worry about it.

06:42.735 --> 06:44.278
We're in this thing together,
buddy.

06:47.907 --> 06:49.826
{\an5}JACKIE:
<i>I don't understand.</i>
<i>I thought you'd be</i>

06:49.909 --> 06:51.994
overjoyed to be going home
by now.

06:52.078 --> 06:53.162
I'm just not ready.

06:53.246 --> 06:55.206
What if one of the
bandages comes off?

06:55.289 --> 06:56.541
{\an3}The thought of it
makes me sick.

06:56.624 --> 06:57.792
I'll help you!

06:57.875 --> 07:00.336
Yeah, right.

07:00.419 --> 07:02.505
{\an3}Thank you. We won't be
needing that today.

07:02.588 --> 07:05.341
I'm gonna be staying here
for the rest of my life.

07:05.424 --> 07:08.302
Honey, you've got to relax.

07:08.386 --> 07:09.303
It's gonna work out.

07:09.387 --> 07:11.889
It's really time to go home now.

07:11.973 --> 07:12.890
{\an1}Hey, Dana.

07:12.974 --> 07:14.809
Hi. Checking out, huh?

07:14.892 --> 07:15.643
Good for you.

07:15.726 --> 07:17.520
How's Alison?
Stabilized, finally.

07:17.603 --> 07:19.814
She's been asking for you.

07:21.566 --> 07:22.984
I'm gonna go see her.

07:23.067 --> 07:24.318
Okay, honey.

07:24.402 --> 07:25.403
Mom, I can do it.

07:31.159 --> 07:33.327
Would you mind if she took me?

07:33.411 --> 07:34.370
Thanks.

07:39.125 --> 07:42.503
She looks awful.

07:42.587 --> 07:46.424
{\an1}I've been a wreck,
but Alison's amazing.

07:46.507 --> 07:47.884
{\an1}The doctors say
her attitude

07:47.967 --> 07:50.511
{\an1}is definitely
why she pulled through.

07:52.972 --> 07:54.223
{\an1}All right,
look lively here.

07:54.307 --> 07:55.141
You've got company.

07:58.436 --> 07:59.520
Your first official
visiting friend...

07:59.604 --> 08:00.521
Hi.

08:00.605 --> 08:03.065
besides me, of course.

08:03.149 --> 08:04.901
Kelly, you look great.

08:05.693 --> 08:07.361
{\an3}I know.

08:07.445 --> 08:10.865
You wish you could say
the same to me.

08:12.783 --> 08:14.118
No.

08:14.202 --> 08:15.870
She's so cheerful,
it's revolting.

08:20.208 --> 08:21.959
I'll be back.

08:28.007 --> 08:29.091
How you doing?

08:29.175 --> 08:32.970
{\an6}Well, they say I'll
be playing piano
in three weeks.

08:33.054 --> 08:35.264
That's terrific.

08:35.347 --> 08:36.390
{\an3}Yeah.

08:36.474 --> 08:38.851
I've always wanted
to play piano.

08:38.934 --> 08:41.312
How are you really doing?

08:41.395 --> 08:44.273
I'm alive.

08:44.357 --> 08:46.108
That's all that matters,
isn't it?

08:46.192 --> 08:50.446
I don't know if I'd be alive
if it weren't for you.

08:50.529 --> 08:51.781
{\an3}Kelly,

08:51.864 --> 08:55.451
I didn't get you through it,
God did.

08:55.534 --> 08:59.580
I don't know about that.

08:59.664 --> 09:02.291
But just as sure
as I'm lying here,

09:02.375 --> 09:07.505
I know that God put you in that
fire, and God brought you out.

09:07.588 --> 09:10.258
{\an3}So if you're happy
to be out,

09:10.341 --> 09:12.468
{\an3}you know who
to thank.

09:17.014 --> 09:19.016
(Andrea speaking Hebrew)

09:22.562 --> 09:24.814
Blessed art thou our God,
Creator of the Universe,

09:24.897 --> 09:27.650
who has commanded us
to kindle the Hanukkah lights.

09:27.733 --> 09:29.694
Amen. Ah!

09:29.777 --> 09:32.280
(lively clarinet music plays)

09:37.576 --> 09:39.161
Thanks for coming
tonight, Brandon.

09:39.245 --> 09:40.162
It's a great boost for us

09:40.246 --> 09:42.331
{\an3}when the Student Body
President shows up.

09:42.415 --> 09:44.959
No problem. You guys do
a lot of good work here.

09:45.042 --> 09:47.044
{\an1}Besides, I've got a thing
for jelly doughnuts.

09:47.128 --> 09:48.879
Brandon, the photographer
from the <i> Condor's</i> running late.

09:48.963 --> 09:50.047
Do you mind staying awhile?

09:50.131 --> 09:51.090
Yeah, why don't you stay?

09:51.173 --> 09:53.968
We've got a latke with your name
on it, ol' buddy.

09:54.051 --> 09:55.845
{\an1}With an offer like that,
how could I refuse?

09:55.928 --> 09:56.929
Already got one?

09:57.013 --> 09:58.514
{\an1}Do you have a phone
I could use?

09:58.597 --> 09:59.598
Yeah, right over there.

09:59.682 --> 10:00.683
{\an1}Great.

10:04.437 --> 10:06.480
DONNA:
<i>Hello. Grand Central!</i>

10:06.564 --> 10:08.899
No, the phone hasn't stopped
ringing since she got home.

10:08.983 --> 10:13.195
I'll let her tell you herself.
Hold on.

10:13.279 --> 10:14.822
{\an3}(whispers):
It's Brandon.

10:14.905 --> 10:16.324
Thanks.

10:16.407 --> 10:18.034
Hi.

10:18.117 --> 10:18.868
How's the candle-lighting?

10:18.951 --> 10:20.453
They asked me to stay
a little longer.

10:20.536 --> 10:22.371
I wanted to call and see
if you needed me.

10:22.455 --> 10:26.083
Well, David and Clare
are on nursing duty tonight

10:26.167 --> 10:29.628
and Jackie's supervising
everything and driving me crazy.

10:29.712 --> 10:31.380
I shouldn't be home too late.

10:31.464 --> 10:33.215
Honey, don't worry.
Stay as long as you want.

10:33.299 --> 10:34.508
I'm exhausted.

10:34.592 --> 10:36.052
You sure?

10:36.135 --> 10:38.346
Yeah, go play dreidel for me.

10:38.429 --> 10:40.181
Win us some peanuts
or something.

10:40.264 --> 10:41.599
Okay. I love you.

10:41.682 --> 10:43.851
Love you, too. Bye.

10:43.934 --> 10:46.729
{\an1}You guys, just make sure she
doesn't do anything strenuous.

10:46.812 --> 10:49.440
{\an6}Well, I don't think she's
planning on rearranging
any furniture today.

10:49.523 --> 10:52.401
{\an1}No, but arguing can take
a lot out of a person.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.904
{\an4}KELLY:
I don't need your help--
if I needed your help,

10:54.987 --> 10:56.697
I would ask for your help.

10:56.781 --> 10:58.366
{\an3}(phone ringing)
I'll get it.

10:58.449 --> 11:00.034
Maybe I should stay.

11:00.117 --> 11:01.410
{\an1}DAVID:
Hello?

11:01.494 --> 11:03.746
{\an3}Not if you value
your sanity.

11:03.829 --> 11:05.373
Right. (wry chuckle)

11:05.456 --> 11:06.999
I-I won't be long.

11:07.083 --> 11:08.584
Okay.

11:10.127 --> 11:11.545
Uh-huh.

11:12.505 --> 11:13.589
Yeah.

11:13.673 --> 11:14.423
Uh, Kelly.

11:14.507 --> 11:16.425
You want to talk
to a Tom Hackman?

11:16.509 --> 11:17.426
Who is he?
No!

11:17.510 --> 11:19.095
Absolutely not.

11:19.178 --> 11:20.096
That is that lawyer

11:20.179 --> 11:21.764
{\an3}that is trying to get us
to make a settlement.

11:21.847 --> 11:23.808
I spoke to our lawyer,
and he said we have to wait

11:23.891 --> 11:25.601
{\an6}until you're
all better.
So tell <i> him</i> that.

11:25.684 --> 11:27.436
{\an3}I did, but he keeps
insisting that

11:27.520 --> 11:29.480
we have to settle right away
so that Steve Sanders

11:29.563 --> 11:30.439
won't be prosecuted
on criminal charges.

11:30.523 --> 11:31.565
{\an3}I said that's
not <i> our</i> problem.

11:31.649 --> 11:34.276
David, take his number,
tell him I'll call him tomorrow.

11:34.360 --> 11:36.070
{\an1}JACKIE:
David, hang up on him.

11:36.153 --> 11:37.405
Can I say something?

11:37.488 --> 11:38.572
No.
No.

11:42.034 --> 11:43.369
(phone beeps)

11:43.452 --> 11:45.454
Mom, let me make
one thing clear.

11:45.538 --> 11:48.457
{\an1}I will not do anything
to hurt Steve.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.459
{\an5}Do you know that lawyer
had the gall to come up
to me in the hospital?

11:50.543 --> 11:52.503
Okay, but I'm out now.

11:52.586 --> 11:55.631
{\an6}Well, honey, you have no
idea what your damages
are gonna be yet.

11:55.714 --> 11:57.967
{\an1}Look, Mother, I'm sure
that there have been

11:58.050 --> 12:00.261
other cases similar to mine.

12:00.344 --> 12:02.430
{\an1}Get an estimate,
make a fair settlement,

12:02.513 --> 12:04.849
{\an1}and just don't hold them up--
I want to put this past me.

12:04.932 --> 12:06.350
{\an3}I-I don't blame you.
Of course, you're right.

12:06.434 --> 12:07.435
We do just need

12:07.518 --> 12:08.519
to look toward the future.

12:08.602 --> 12:11.313
{\an1}Soon you'll be all healed up
and feeling strong again,

12:11.397 --> 12:13.441
{\an1}and everything will be
just like it was before.

12:13.524 --> 12:14.692
I doubt that.

12:14.775 --> 12:18.112
Well, if it's any consolation,
I got a call from Fran Kurtis,

12:18.195 --> 12:20.281
and the Ellison Agency
wants to represent you

12:20.364 --> 12:22.366
as soon as you're up to it.

12:22.450 --> 12:25.077
Mom, I hate
to break this to you,

12:25.161 --> 12:27.163
but my modeling days are over.

12:27.246 --> 12:28.664
Oh, I don't want to hear that.

12:28.747 --> 12:31.167
It may take a while,
but the doctor said you...

12:31.250 --> 12:32.543
Do I have to repeat myself?

12:32.626 --> 12:34.170
I am never modeling again.

12:34.253 --> 12:35.337
Well, you can't just give up!

12:35.421 --> 12:37.506
Not with all the momentum
you've got going right now.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.300
No, what I've got right now
is a headache.

12:39.383 --> 12:41.302
And I am so tired
of hearing you say

12:41.385 --> 12:43.345
that everything's gonna be
just the way it was before.

12:43.429 --> 12:45.514
Well, what's wrong
with the way it was before.

12:45.598 --> 12:47.183
Nothing. I don't know.

12:47.266 --> 12:49.810
{\an1}Well, what do you
want to do?

12:49.894 --> 12:51.437
Smell the roses.

12:51.520 --> 12:52.897
Maybe ponder the question

12:52.980 --> 12:55.983
of why God bothers to give us
life in the first place

12:56.066 --> 12:59.445
when all he does is seem to fill
it with pain and suffering.

13:00.446 --> 13:01.697
Kelly...

13:01.780 --> 13:04.200
Can you take me to bed?
I'm feeling very tired.

13:05.910 --> 13:07.119
Yes.

13:08.746 --> 13:10.372
(playing lively music)

13:16.462 --> 13:18.380
What does that mean?

13:18.464 --> 13:19.924
{\an3}Seven out,
I guess. Great.

13:20.007 --> 13:21.967
Hey, for the boys in the yo.

13:22.051 --> 13:24.261
{\an5}Kid took all my gelt.
Ah, Brandon,
thanks for coming.

13:24.345 --> 13:27.223
{\an3}If you decide not to come
to our Hanukkah party,

13:27.306 --> 13:28.390
{\an3}I won't hold it
against you.

13:28.474 --> 13:29.767
Thanks, Andrea.

13:29.850 --> 13:32.228
Even though it is
Hannah's first Hanukkah at home.

13:32.311 --> 13:34.271
{\an3}How do you say no
to this woman?

13:34.355 --> 13:36.023
{\an1}I don't.
Take it easy, Brandon.

13:36.106 --> 13:37.525
{\an3}Oh, hey,
congratulations.

13:37.608 --> 13:38.526
Andrea told me you got

13:38.609 --> 13:40.486
into the trial advocacy
program-- that's great.

13:40.569 --> 13:41.654
Thanks. Yeah,
I'm psyched.

13:41.737 --> 13:43.697
Does that mean you go into
real courts and everything?

13:43.781 --> 13:45.407
Real cases, real clients--
it's for people

13:45.491 --> 13:47.451
who can't afford a lawyer
but need one.

13:47.535 --> 13:48.744
{\an1}ANDREA:
And it's hard work,

13:48.827 --> 13:50.246
{\an3}and he starts tomorrow,
so we better

13:50.329 --> 13:51.914
{\an3}take Daddy home, huh,
and put him to bed.

13:51.997 --> 13:53.415
Good night, guys.
Good night, baby.

13:53.499 --> 13:54.750
Good night. Are you
gonna go see Kelly?

13:54.833 --> 13:58.587
Yeah. Yeah, I got
to stop off someplace first.

13:58.671 --> 13:59.880
{\an1}Give her our love,
would you?

13:59.964 --> 14:01.423
{\an3}Sure will.
Happy Hanukkah.

14:01.507 --> 14:02.716
(grunts)
Yes!

14:02.800 --> 14:05.219
Shall we dance?
Shall we dance?

14:19.525 --> 14:20.484
Hi.

14:27.491 --> 14:30.286
{\an1}You're sure there's
nothing else I can get you?

14:30.369 --> 14:32.371
What else have you got?

14:32.454 --> 14:35.416
What else would you like?

14:35.499 --> 14:39.795
Another something
from the "honor bar," perhaps.

14:39.878 --> 14:42.298
(clears throat):
There's a thought.

14:42.381 --> 14:45.301
{\an3}What if instead of little
jars of macadamia nuts,

14:45.384 --> 14:49.471
{\an6}the honor bar actually
was stocked with
"honorable" things?

14:49.555 --> 14:50.973
{\an1}Like?

14:51.056 --> 14:52.850
Like truth, like justice.

14:52.933 --> 14:54.310
Like the American way.

14:54.393 --> 14:57.104
(laughs):
Are you in need of those things?

14:57.187 --> 15:01.025
Well, to tell you the truth,
I am feeling a wee tad guilty.

15:01.108 --> 15:02.318
Well, I could go.

15:02.401 --> 15:05.154
I could head to La Jolla
a couple days early.

15:05.237 --> 15:07.823
No, no, no.

15:07.906 --> 15:10.701
I really appreciate
you sticking around.

15:12.745 --> 15:15.122
I've told you that
already, haven't I?

15:15.205 --> 15:16.957
About 20 times.

15:17.958 --> 15:19.793
Yeah.

15:22.921 --> 15:27.217
{\an6}You know, I... I haven't
really told Kelly that
you stayed in town.

15:27.301 --> 15:29.845
{\an3}She still thinks it was
a four-hour layover.

15:29.928 --> 15:32.931
So then you never really
gave her my regards.

15:33.015 --> 15:35.768
Only by proxy.

15:35.851 --> 15:37.353
So let me get this straight.

15:37.436 --> 15:39.229
Your girlfriend
is in the hospital

15:39.313 --> 15:40.731
with serious injuries,

15:40.814 --> 15:43.442
and you chose to be less
than a hundred-percent honest

15:43.525 --> 15:45.611
{\an1}about a subject
that could be

15:45.694 --> 15:47.154
potentially very upsetting.

15:47.237 --> 15:49.073
Is that an accurate assessment?

15:49.156 --> 15:50.407
Pretty much.

15:50.491 --> 15:52.201
{\an1}Don't beat yourself up
about it.

15:52.284 --> 15:54.453
Just try and remember
one very important thing.

15:54.536 --> 15:55.871
What's that?

15:55.954 --> 15:58.290
Timing is everything.

16:07.091 --> 16:11.011
{\an5}Wow, this place sure
looks different from the
last time I was here.

16:11.095 --> 16:12.388
Well, what'd you expect?

16:12.471 --> 16:13.764
{\an1}You haven't been here
since Halloween.

16:13.847 --> 16:16.725
{\an5}Well, it's really crowded.
I told him there'd be
a big turnout,

16:16.809 --> 16:19.019
{\an1}but did he listen to me,
hire some more help?

16:19.103 --> 16:20.229
No, not Mr. Tightwad.

16:20.312 --> 16:22.523
{\an1}I sweat it out,
but he rakes it in.

16:22.606 --> 16:23.607
Who?

16:23.691 --> 16:25.234
My wonderful Uncle Virgil.

16:25.317 --> 16:26.402
{\an3}Ray, where's that
chicken wire?

16:26.485 --> 16:28.112
How the hell should I know?

16:28.195 --> 16:30.864
Do an old man a favor and
go look for it, will you?

16:30.948 --> 16:32.449
{\an3}Don't you even say
hello to Donna?

16:32.533 --> 16:33.909
{\an1}You know,
I don't think <i> you</i>

16:33.992 --> 16:35.369
even said hello to Donna.

16:35.452 --> 16:37.121
{\an3}Oh, I'm sorry,
I don't have time.

16:37.204 --> 16:40.207
{\an3}I have to go find
the damn chicken wire.

16:42.501 --> 16:44.253
{\an3}He's in a
good mood, huh?

16:44.336 --> 16:46.547
{\an1}(chuckles):
Yeah, and I'm Santy Claus.

16:48.048 --> 16:49.425
(brief chuckle)

16:49.508 --> 16:51.385
{\an6}Mr. Pedroza,
at the hearing,
we want to present

16:51.468 --> 16:53.429
{\an3}your childcare situation
in the best possible light.

16:53.512 --> 16:55.347
{\an3}Now, isn't there any
family member, any relative

16:55.431 --> 16:58.767
{\an6}who can come stay
with you for a while?
No.

16:58.851 --> 17:00.769
I have no one like that.

17:00.853 --> 17:05.022
Since my wife died,
all that I have are my babies.

17:06.525 --> 17:08.277
{\an1}<i>Gracias.</i>

17:08.359 --> 17:10.112
{\an1}You understand,
can't you?

17:10.194 --> 17:12.740
{\an1}I-I had no diapers
for the morning.

17:12.823 --> 17:14.950
None. A-And no milk.

17:15.032 --> 17:16.743
They were both sound asleep.

17:16.827 --> 17:18.871
I-I asked my neighbor
to help me.

17:18.954 --> 17:21.290
How was I to know
that she would leave them?

17:21.373 --> 17:23.333
There was no way you could know.

17:23.416 --> 17:24.835
{\an1}No way. Right, Jesse?
Well...

17:24.917 --> 17:26.837
i-it's a little more
complicated than that.

17:26.920 --> 17:29.089
A four-year-old wandering
the streets alone at night

17:29.173 --> 17:30.299
doesn't look so good.

17:30.382 --> 17:32.050
Come on, every house
has a pair of scissors.

17:32.134 --> 17:34.178
What kind of standards are they
trying to hold this man to?

17:34.261 --> 17:36.180
{\an6}JESSE:
The risks we take
with our kids

17:36.263 --> 17:37.973
are entirely academic--
until we get

17:38.057 --> 17:39.808
into the juvenile court system.
Why?

17:39.892 --> 17:41.059
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

17:41.143 --> 17:43.979
Is that because some social
worker wants to cover her butt?

17:44.062 --> 17:45.314
I mean, can't they see

17:45.397 --> 17:47.107
that those kids belong
with their father?

17:47.191 --> 17:48.275
Would you be my lawyer?

17:50.194 --> 17:51.987
{\an4}JESSE:
Señor Pedroza,
the whole issue

17:52.070 --> 17:53.655
is what is best
for the children,

17:53.739 --> 17:55.240
and I am sure, I-'m positive

17:55.324 --> 17:57.493
that when we explain
all this to the judge, well,

17:57.576 --> 18:00.370
he'll see that it was clearly
not a case of child abuse

18:00.454 --> 18:01.997
and let them come home to you.

18:02.080 --> 18:03.999
(chuckles)

18:04.082 --> 18:05.834
It'll be okay.

18:05.918 --> 18:07.503
It'll be all right.

18:07.586 --> 18:09.463
VALERIE:
<i>Steve, just listen, okay?</i>

18:09.546 --> 18:11.965
{\an3}What are you being
charged with?

18:12.049 --> 18:15.302
{\an1}Malicious mischief,
trespassing, vandalism.

18:15.385 --> 18:17.137
{\an3}So what you're
saying is,

18:17.221 --> 18:18.514
you need a witness, right?

18:18.597 --> 18:20.516
A witness that will
give you an alibi.

18:20.599 --> 18:21.767
Oh, yeah, thanks.

18:21.850 --> 18:24.520
This way when they ask me where
I was when the fire broke out,

18:24.603 --> 18:26.647
{\an1}I could say that
I was having sex with you.

18:26.730 --> 18:29.650
(laughs):
Steve, you don't get it, do you?

18:29.733 --> 18:34.029
What I mean is, I will say
whatever you want me to say.

18:34.112 --> 18:35.239
So in other words,
you're willing

18:35.322 --> 18:36.323
to commit perjury, is that it?

18:36.406 --> 18:38.534
No, I'd like to call it, uh,

18:38.617 --> 18:40.327
having a selective memory.

18:40.410 --> 18:42.496
(chuckles):
You're a piece of work, Valerie.

18:42.579 --> 18:45.374
Steve, just-just
think it over, okay?

18:45.457 --> 18:46.583
I've been thinking it over,

18:46.667 --> 18:48.168
{\an3}and over and
over and over,

18:48.252 --> 18:50.337
and all I hear in my mind
are the attorneys saying,

18:50.420 --> 18:51.713
{\an3}"Don't worry, you're
gonna get off!"

18:51.797 --> 18:53.006
Oh, that's great, right?

18:53.090 --> 18:54.424
Great?

18:54.508 --> 18:57.219
There's nothing
even remotely great

18:57.302 --> 18:59.304
about my situation, Valerie.

19:07.521 --> 19:08.939
{\an1}Hey, Steve.
How you doing?

19:09.022 --> 19:10.524
I'm hanging in, I guess.

19:10.607 --> 19:12.317
How's Kelly?
It's tough, you know.

19:12.401 --> 19:14.403
{\an1}I'm going over
to see her right now.

19:14.486 --> 19:16.238
{\an3}I feel so bad about
what happened to her.

19:16.321 --> 19:19.408
{\an3}I don't even know if she's
aware of how much I love her,

19:19.491 --> 19:22.035
how much she means
to me, it's just...

19:22.119 --> 19:24.997
{\an1}I'm sure she knows, Steve--
you tell her every day.

19:25.080 --> 19:26.623
(laughs)

19:26.707 --> 19:30.419
That girl upstairs, though,
she's one weird bird.

19:30.502 --> 19:32.963
What'd she do now?

19:33.046 --> 19:35.299
{\an3}Well...

19:35.382 --> 19:38.218
{\an3}she offered to lie
in court for me.

19:38.302 --> 19:39.761
That sounds about right.

19:39.845 --> 19:42.306
{\an1}Valerie's always thought
the truth was very overrated.

19:42.389 --> 19:45.809
{\an3}Well, I used to be
that way, too, I guess.

19:45.893 --> 19:47.603
{\an6}(sighs):
I've come to
the conclusion

19:47.686 --> 19:50.480
{\an3}that I can't squirm
my way out of this one.

19:50.564 --> 19:52.316
Bottom line,

19:52.399 --> 19:53.609
it was my gig.

19:53.692 --> 19:56.987
I've got to accept
responsibility for it.

19:57.070 --> 19:58.989
Took a lot
of tossing and turning

19:59.072 --> 20:01.950
to get to that point
before I could sleep at night.

20:05.537 --> 20:07.456
Give my love to Kelly.

20:07.539 --> 20:09.333
Yeah.

20:11.585 --> 20:14.588
Take it easy, bro.

20:14.671 --> 20:17.132
{\an3}Look, lady,
it's very simple--

20:17.215 --> 20:19.301
you don't want it,
don't buy it, okay?

20:19.384 --> 20:22.346
{\an3}I got other customers here--
I don't need this.

20:23.388 --> 20:25.474
(sighs)

20:25.557 --> 20:27.684
Ray, what's the matter?
What's the matter?

20:27.768 --> 20:29.770
{\an1}Christmas is
the phoniest holiday ever.

20:29.853 --> 20:31.313
{\an1}It's all about, uh,
peace and love,

20:31.396 --> 20:33.148
goodwill to the almighty buck.

20:33.231 --> 20:35.817
I don't need it.
I told that lady to shove it.

20:35.901 --> 20:38.946
{\an4}Ray!
Well, she's got me
trucking all over the lot.

20:39.029 --> 20:40.781
"I want this one.
No, no, that one.

20:40.864 --> 20:41.990
No, no, no, this one."

20:42.074 --> 20:43.867
{\an1}Then she wants
to bargain with me.

20:43.951 --> 20:45.577
{\an3}(chuckles):
Maybe that's my fault.

20:45.661 --> 20:47.621
I told her we had
the lowest prices.

20:47.704 --> 20:50.540
{\an4}Well, maybe you should
ask me first before
you open your mouth.

20:52.542 --> 20:55.379
Yeah, well, maybe I should have.

20:57.422 --> 20:58.882
Donna...

20:58.966 --> 21:00.342
don't take it personally.

21:00.425 --> 21:02.177
He's just in a bad temper.

21:02.260 --> 21:03.720
A bad temper?

21:03.804 --> 21:07.140
That's like saying Hurricane
Andrew was a bad rainstorm.

21:07.224 --> 21:10.143
Have you met his mother?

21:10.227 --> 21:11.770
{\an3}No. Why?

21:11.853 --> 21:13.397
Well, then you'd understand.

21:13.480 --> 21:14.731
WOMAN:
Excuse me, sir?

21:14.815 --> 21:16.525
Yes, ma'am?

21:23.490 --> 21:25.534
(door closes)

21:28.245 --> 21:31.665
Madame, your driver awaits.

21:33.458 --> 21:36.044
I'm not going anywhere.

21:36.128 --> 21:37.713
But I thought
you had an appointment.

21:37.796 --> 21:39.381
I don't want to go.

21:39.464 --> 21:41.049
Okay...

21:41.133 --> 21:44.428
but your mom seemed to think
this guy was pretty good.

21:44.511 --> 21:46.221
Did you hear me?
I said, I'm not going.

21:46.304 --> 21:48.348
I heard you.

21:48.432 --> 21:49.558
I don't need a plastic surgeon

21:49.641 --> 21:52.436
to tell me how much better
he thinks he can make me look.

21:52.519 --> 21:55.230
All right, if you think it looks
okay, then blow him off.

21:55.313 --> 22:00.736
Brandon, can we just please
talk about something else?

22:00.819 --> 22:03.238
This is harder
than you thought, huh?

22:03.321 --> 22:07.409
Yeah.

22:07.492 --> 22:10.412
Why don't we talk
about you, okay?

22:14.458 --> 22:15.751
{\an1}What have you been
doing with yourself?

22:15.834 --> 22:16.752
Nothing.

22:16.835 --> 22:18.754
You know, the usual.

22:18.837 --> 22:21.048
Really? Just hitting the books.

22:21.131 --> 22:23.091
Yeah.

22:23.175 --> 22:24.593
{\an3}I saw Emily Valentine
the other day.

22:24.676 --> 22:25.761
She sends her regards.

22:25.844 --> 22:27.721
{\an1}Right, on the night
of the fire?

22:27.804 --> 22:29.681
Yeah.

22:31.349 --> 22:33.560
Actually, no.

22:33.643 --> 22:35.270
She had a change of plans,

22:35.353 --> 22:36.938
{\an3}and is staying in
L.A. for a bit.

22:37.022 --> 22:39.733
I thought she had some
course she was taking?

22:39.816 --> 22:43.320
She does, but she had a few days
to kill before it starts.

22:43.403 --> 22:46.656
So you killed
some time with her?

22:46.740 --> 22:48.116
Yeah.

22:48.200 --> 22:49.409
It was no big deal.

22:49.493 --> 22:50.285
Don't worry.

22:50.368 --> 22:52.454
Why should I be worried?

22:52.537 --> 22:54.331
You shouldn't worry.

22:54.414 --> 22:55.999
There's no reason
for you to worry.

22:56.083 --> 22:57.292
You just look worried.

22:57.375 --> 23:00.629
Right.

23:00.712 --> 23:06.093
Maybe I look worried because
I am in constant pain.

23:06.176 --> 23:08.512
Maybe I look worried
because I was caught in a fire.

23:08.595 --> 23:10.972
Maybe that's why
I look worried.

23:11.056 --> 23:13.141
Maybe I don't need you
coming over here

23:13.225 --> 23:14.559
and telling me
how worried I look!

23:14.643 --> 23:17.437
All right, then what do
you need from me?

23:17.521 --> 23:21.316
I don't know, Brandon.

23:21.399 --> 23:25.445
So, if you want to go kill some
time with Emily, go right ahead.

23:29.908 --> 23:33.286
This is really not a good time.

23:33.370 --> 23:34.871
I just want to be alone.

23:37.082 --> 23:39.209
All right,
if that's what you want,

23:39.292 --> 23:41.545
I'll call you later.

23:41.628 --> 23:44.047
You don't have to.

23:44.131 --> 23:46.007
I'll call you later.

23:46.091 --> 23:47.843
{\an1}Maybe you should
get some rest.

23:50.554 --> 23:51.555
(sobbing)

23:57.894 --> 23:59.396
All right, whoa, whoa,
wait a minute.

23:59.479 --> 24:01.398
Now you know you can
always call me.

24:01.481 --> 24:04.317
I'm lucky you finally
got phone privileges.

24:04.401 --> 24:06.361
Otherwise, I might've
jumped out a window by now.

24:06.444 --> 24:09.364
Let's see, second story,
you're on the sand...

24:09.447 --> 24:10.532
yeah, it'd be all right.

24:10.615 --> 24:12.325
That's true.

24:12.409 --> 24:14.703
I guess I would have had to find
a much taller building.

24:14.786 --> 24:17.414
No, no, don't want to do
buildings, way too messy.

24:17.497 --> 24:19.416
Dylan, what am I going to do?

24:19.499 --> 24:20.959
Kel, you don't gotta
do anything.

24:21.042 --> 24:24.337
Just relax, just let it happen.

24:24.421 --> 24:26.631
It'll change, trust me,
I ought to know.

24:27.591 --> 24:30.051
{\an3}Hold on.

24:30.135 --> 24:32.012
{\an3}Mr. McKay, you have
a visitor on the grounds.

24:32.095 --> 24:34.264
A Brandon Walsh?

24:34.347 --> 24:35.849
Thanks, Eddie.

24:36.808 --> 24:37.934
Speak of the devil.

24:38.018 --> 24:39.394
It's your good friend, Brandon.

24:39.477 --> 24:41.771
Look, don't tell him
what we talked about, okay?

24:41.855 --> 24:43.398
I don't know, Kel,
keeping secrets--

24:43.481 --> 24:45.901
that's what got me in here
in the first place.

24:45.984 --> 24:47.861
I know, but if he asks you...

24:47.944 --> 24:50.363
If he asks me,
I gotta come clean.

24:50.447 --> 24:52.365
Bye.

24:52.449 --> 24:54.451
{\an1}This place is
so mellow, man.

24:54.534 --> 24:56.494
{\an1}You sure you want
to check out?

24:56.578 --> 24:57.412
Oh, yeah.

24:57.495 --> 25:00.415
{\an3}I just don't want to
have to check back in.

25:00.498 --> 25:03.919
{\an3}So, once in awhile I've gotta
check in with myself.

25:04.002 --> 25:07.255
{\an3}Out there, I ain't got no
safety nets, it's a free fall.

25:07.339 --> 25:09.424
{\an3}I don't know if
you notice, I fall.

25:09.507 --> 25:11.468
{\an1}Sounds like you've been
giving it a lot of thought.

25:11.551 --> 25:13.595
{\an3}Yeah, well, what else
do I got to do in here?

25:13.678 --> 25:15.263
Yeah.

25:15.347 --> 25:18.099
{\an3}Why'd you come
down here today?

25:18.183 --> 25:20.268
I wanted to see you.

25:20.352 --> 25:23.271
{\an1}I wanted to talk to you
a little bit about Kelly.

25:23.355 --> 25:25.023
All right.

25:26.524 --> 25:32.113
Well, first of all, you know
she got caught in this fire.

25:32.197 --> 25:33.949
{\an3}Yeah, I talked to her
a little while ago.

25:34.032 --> 25:35.617
{\an3}Sounds like she's
having a rough time.

25:35.700 --> 25:36.785
Yeah, she is.

25:36.868 --> 25:39.120
{\an1}And I don't quite
know how to handle it.

25:39.204 --> 25:43.500
I mean, she's having some kind
of self-image problem and...

25:45.752 --> 25:47.712
I mean, her face
isn't that bad.

25:47.796 --> 25:49.130
{\an3}Her face?

25:49.214 --> 25:50.465
How bad is it?

25:50.548 --> 25:54.010
I don't know, she won't
show me all the damage.

25:54.094 --> 25:55.470
{\an1}It's like she
doesn't trust me.

25:55.553 --> 25:57.472
Maybe she doesn't.

25:59.432 --> 26:01.601
The Emily Valentine thing,

26:01.685 --> 26:04.479
it kind of threw
her for a loop.

26:04.562 --> 26:05.647
(sighs)

26:05.730 --> 26:07.023
She mentioned Em?

26:07.107 --> 26:08.692
How is Em?

26:08.775 --> 26:10.485
She's fine.

26:10.568 --> 26:12.862
{\an3}Well, be sure and
tell her I said hello.

26:12.946 --> 26:15.490
And what makes you think I'm
going to be seeing her again?

26:15.573 --> 26:16.741
I got nothin' going on there.

26:16.825 --> 26:20.161
{\an3}You ever read any
Shakespeare, Brandon?

26:20.245 --> 26:21.162
{\an1}Yeah.

26:21.246 --> 26:24.624
{\an3}Well, methinks thou doth
protest way too much.

26:26.376 --> 26:29.129
Okay, maybe I doth.

26:29.212 --> 26:31.589
{\an3}You doth.

26:36.052 --> 26:38.638
Ray, want some food?

26:38.722 --> 26:40.181
Where'd you get it?

26:40.265 --> 26:41.808
Your aunt brought it over.

26:41.891 --> 26:44.769
{\an1}No, her cooking
tastes like dog food.

26:44.853 --> 26:46.021
Okay.

26:46.104 --> 26:47.731
Um, there's a coffee
shop up the street.

26:47.814 --> 26:49.190
I could go get
you something?

26:49.274 --> 26:51.192
{\an1}No. I don't want you
to buy me dinner.

26:51.276 --> 26:52.444
Well, what do you want?

26:52.527 --> 26:53.987
{\an3}Look, you invite me
to come down here

26:54.070 --> 26:56.323
and then you do your best
to make me want to leave.

26:56.406 --> 26:57.365
Hey, Donna, wait.

26:57.449 --> 26:59.701
Look, I'm sorry.

26:59.784 --> 27:01.578
I'm just tired.

27:01.661 --> 27:04.873
No, I've seen you
tired before.

27:04.956 --> 27:06.541
This is something else.

27:08.960 --> 27:11.379
It's my mom.

27:11.463 --> 27:13.506
You don't know her,

27:13.590 --> 27:15.175
but she's uh,
she's a good person.

27:15.258 --> 27:17.260
She usually never drinks,
but every year at this time,

27:17.344 --> 27:19.220
she, uh, she shows up here,

27:19.304 --> 27:21.890
or somewhere, drunk,

27:21.973 --> 27:25.060
and makes a big ugly scene.

27:25.143 --> 27:27.562
{\an3}It's just a matter
of time.

27:27.645 --> 27:30.065
So, maybe it won't
happen this year.

27:30.148 --> 27:31.733
No, it already started.

27:31.816 --> 27:33.401
{\an3}I left her ranting and
raving this morning

27:33.485 --> 27:36.571
{\an3}when I poured out all the
alcohol in the house.

27:36.654 --> 27:38.239
See, my dad left
at Christmastime.

27:38.323 --> 27:41.951
He, uh... pushed her down
the stairs, and took off.

27:42.035 --> 27:45.246
She got hurt pretty bad,
and lost a baby.

27:45.330 --> 27:47.415
I'm sorry.

27:47.499 --> 27:49.876
So, every December,
she falls off the wagon,

27:49.959 --> 27:52.253
'cause that's when he left--

27:52.337 --> 27:54.172
20 years ago, Christmas day.

27:55.799 --> 27:57.217
That's so amazing.

27:57.300 --> 27:58.760
Why is that so amazing?

27:58.843 --> 28:01.471
'Cause the day that your dad
left your mom,

28:01.554 --> 28:03.515
that's the exact day
that I was born.

28:07.352 --> 28:08.937
Well, maybe things
will be different,

28:09.020 --> 28:10.438
now that you came along.

28:21.366 --> 28:22.617
{\an5}Hey, Steve!
Excuse me.
Ah, Jesse.

28:22.700 --> 28:23.952
How's it going?

28:24.035 --> 28:25.286
How're your cases going?
It's great, great.

28:25.370 --> 28:27.330
{\an1}The facts are definitely
on our side right now.

28:27.414 --> 28:30.291
I'm a little nervous,
first court appearance and all.

28:30.375 --> 28:31.793
Don't be, you'll do great.

28:31.876 --> 28:33.420
I was a little sweaty
myself this morning.

28:33.503 --> 28:35.839
And then my father calls
and says that it's in the bag.

28:35.922 --> 28:37.966
All I gotta do is show up
wearing this suit.

28:38.049 --> 28:39.300
Hey, you coming by later on
to light the candles?

28:39.384 --> 28:41.177
Yeah, we'll celebrate then.

28:41.261 --> 28:43.221
<i>Buena suerte, hombre.</i>
Later.

28:45.390 --> 28:46.808
Dad.

28:46.891 --> 28:49.436
Nice of you to join us.

28:49.519 --> 28:51.980
Steve, a couple of things.

28:52.063 --> 28:53.940
You're going to
plead no contest

28:54.023 --> 28:55.483
{\an3}to one count of
disturbing the peace.

28:55.567 --> 28:56.943
Now the D.A. has agreed

28:57.026 --> 28:58.987
{\an1}to dismiss
everything else.

28:59.070 --> 29:00.530
{\an3}She's recommending 100
hours of community service,

29:00.613 --> 29:01.781
which isn't a lot,

29:01.865 --> 29:02.991
That's not bad. What's this?

29:03.074 --> 29:05.410
{\an3}These are the releases
from the victims.

29:05.493 --> 29:07.328
We couldn't have gotten
this deal without them.

29:07.412 --> 29:08.246
What about Kelly?

29:08.329 --> 29:10.832
{\an3}She called me actually,
two days ago.

29:10.915 --> 29:12.792
{\an3}She was very sweet,
very cooperative.

29:12.876 --> 29:14.002
She made out very well.

29:14.085 --> 29:16.504
{\an3}And the other girl
was a breeze.

29:16.588 --> 29:17.297
{\an3}Hey, consider
yourself lucky.

29:17.380 --> 29:18.840
I do.

29:31.311 --> 29:32.312
{\an1}EMILY:
I wouldn't worry about Kelly.

29:32.395 --> 29:34.230
{\an1}I'm sure it was just
the last straw

29:34.314 --> 29:35.690
on top of everything else.

29:35.773 --> 29:37.775
Maybe she could tell
I was kind of conflicted.

29:37.859 --> 29:39.986
She'll feel a lot better
after I'm gone.

29:40.069 --> 29:41.863
But how will I feel?

29:43.573 --> 29:45.450
Well, that's a good question.

29:48.620 --> 29:50.330
Am I a low and vile creature

29:50.413 --> 29:52.874
for wanting you to stay?

29:54.584 --> 29:56.878
You're asking the wrong person.

29:59.088 --> 30:00.507
Do you want me to stay?

30:02.967 --> 30:06.387
You know, if we were having this
conversation six months ago,

30:06.471 --> 30:07.889
or even six months from now,

30:07.972 --> 30:09.390
it might be completely
different,

30:09.474 --> 30:11.434
but... right now...

30:11.518 --> 30:14.103
I know. Listen...

30:14.187 --> 30:16.731
it is what it is.

30:16.814 --> 30:18.441
We can't change it.

30:19.776 --> 30:23.321
You said it yourself,
timing is everything.

30:23.404 --> 30:25.448
I know.

30:25.532 --> 30:28.701
And Kelly needs you now.

30:28.785 --> 30:30.370
It could never be right.

30:36.876 --> 30:38.795
But I still love you.

30:38.878 --> 30:41.422
I love you, too.

30:51.516 --> 30:52.725
Brandon...

30:54.394 --> 30:56.771
Yeah, I should go, huh?

30:56.854 --> 30:59.107
We wouldn't want
to get carried away.

30:59.190 --> 31:02.735
That's the thing...

31:02.819 --> 31:06.406
I was just kind of wishing,
maybe there was some way

31:06.489 --> 31:09.325
it would be okay
to get carried away.

31:13.913 --> 31:15.999
How do you plead to count one:

31:16.082 --> 31:18.459
disturbing the peace--
Section 415 of the Penal Code?

31:18.543 --> 31:19.294
Mr. Sanders?

31:19.377 --> 31:21.129
No contest, Your Honor.

31:21.212 --> 31:22.463
Mr. Stone?

31:22.547 --> 31:24.465
No contest, Your Honor.

31:24.549 --> 31:26.426
{\an6}JUDGE:
Do you both understand
that a plea of no contest,

31:26.509 --> 31:27.468
or nolo contendere,

31:27.552 --> 31:29.804
is equal to a plea of guilty
in this courtroom?

31:29.887 --> 31:31.598
Yes, Your Honor.

31:31.681 --> 31:33.308
{\an3}Yes, Your Honor.
I will accept the plea

31:33.391 --> 31:34.350
of no contest to count one.

31:34.434 --> 31:36.477
{\an3}The sentence for each
of the defendants shall be

31:36.561 --> 31:40.106
100 hours of community
service, a $1,000 fine,

31:40.189 --> 31:42.150
{\an1}and two years
informal probation.

31:42.233 --> 31:45.278
In addition, you are
both prohibited

31:45.361 --> 31:46.654
from promoting, organizing,

31:46.738 --> 31:50.450
{\an4}sponsoring, or in any way
participating in the
"dance party" business

31:50.533 --> 31:52.619
{\an1}or parties for profit
of any kind,

31:52.702 --> 31:55.371
{\an4}gatherings, raves,
whatever you call them,
for a period of two years.

31:55.455 --> 31:57.290
The remaining counts
are dismissed.

31:57.373 --> 31:59.208
Next case.

32:04.922 --> 32:06.924
{\an1}Congratulations.
Thank you very much.

32:19.145 --> 32:20.438
{\an3}How could you let
them do this to me?

32:20.521 --> 32:21.689
How could you sell
me out like that?!

32:21.773 --> 32:23.191
Nobody sold you out.
We saved your hide.

32:23.274 --> 32:24.651
{\an3}Oh, come on, those charges
were bogus, and you know it.

32:24.734 --> 32:27.403
{\an6}Hackman even said they
just wanted somebody to
pay for the fire trucks!

32:27.487 --> 32:30.365
{\an5}What is the matter with you?
You should be jumping for joy
to get rid of this headache.

32:30.448 --> 32:31.407
It's Stone, it's Stone!

32:31.491 --> 32:33.701
{\an3}Because his butt was
on the line, I had to cave!

32:33.785 --> 32:34.869
I can't believe this!

32:34.952 --> 32:36.287
I can't believe how
ungrateful you are.

32:36.371 --> 32:39.207
{\an5}Stone paid off the city,
he paid off the victims,
he paid for your lawyer.

32:39.290 --> 32:40.083
That's my point!

32:40.166 --> 32:41.417
If I had a lawyer
on my own accord,

32:41.501 --> 32:44.420
{\an5}then maybe somebody
would've been looking
out for what I want!

32:44.504 --> 32:45.380
Are you serious?

32:45.463 --> 32:47.048
{\an1}Anybody who steals a key
to an abandoned house

32:47.131 --> 32:48.424
{\an1}has no right to
complain about anything.

32:48.508 --> 32:49.550
What'd you say?

32:49.634 --> 32:50.718
I didn't steal any key!

32:50.802 --> 32:52.345
Oh, get off it, Steve.

32:52.428 --> 32:54.263
{\an1}Griffin already admitted
the two of you lifted the key

32:54.347 --> 32:55.390
{\an1}right out of Ted Stone's
realty office.

32:55.473 --> 32:57.141
And if I know you,
it was your idea.

32:57.225 --> 32:58.267
Griffin said I
lifted a key?

32:58.351 --> 33:00.019
{\an3}He told me
he had permission!

33:00.103 --> 33:02.438
That's the only reason I gave
him a cut in the first place!

33:02.522 --> 33:05.566
Yeah, yeah, right.

33:05.650 --> 33:07.443
{\an1}I am so grateful
I don't have to hear

33:07.527 --> 33:08.903
{\an1}about this crap anymore
or about the parties.

33:08.986 --> 33:10.905
How can you say that to me?

33:10.988 --> 33:12.740
{\an3}How could you
say that after knowing

33:12.824 --> 33:15.451
that I put my heart
and soul into this.

33:15.535 --> 33:18.454
This was gonna be my career,
my future, my livelihood!

33:18.538 --> 33:19.914
I'm afraid I cannot
listen any longer

33:19.997 --> 33:21.082
to your moaning
and your wailing.

33:21.165 --> 33:23.626
{\an1}You ought to shut your mouth,
and be grateful you got off

33:23.710 --> 33:25.253
as easy as you did.

33:25.336 --> 33:27.422
The next time you get in trouble

33:27.505 --> 33:29.257
and you need somebody
to bail you out,

33:29.340 --> 33:31.426
do me a favor: call your mother.

33:34.721 --> 33:36.764
Great. Great.

33:46.733 --> 33:49.360
Hey, Steverino!
Way to go, dude!

33:49.444 --> 33:50.445
Nice room you got here, Stone.

33:50.528 --> 33:51.821
Too bad you're moving out.

33:51.904 --> 33:53.948
There's a two-year waiting
period for this room.

33:54.031 --> 33:54.949
I'm not going anywhere.

33:55.032 --> 33:56.033
Oh, yes, you are.

33:56.117 --> 33:58.077
And I'll tell you why.

33:58.161 --> 34:02.123
If I have to look at your face
one more day, I'll puke.

34:02.206 --> 34:04.459
The pressure must've gotten
to you, Sanders.

34:04.542 --> 34:05.334
You're cracking up.

34:05.418 --> 34:06.544
{\an1}You know,

34:06.627 --> 34:10.130
I knew your old man was on
the hook for a load of damages.

34:10.214 --> 34:12.467
I also knew he wouldn't
want the publicity

34:12.550 --> 34:14.177
from a full-blown court case.

34:14.260 --> 34:17.429
{\an1}But I only just found out
why our lawyer--

34:17.513 --> 34:20.349
or let me say this--
your daddy's lawyer,

34:20.433 --> 34:23.478
why he didn't want to fight
those bogus charges,

34:23.561 --> 34:26.438
because in your case,
they weren't bogus, were they?

34:26.522 --> 34:29.442
{\an1}You ripped off
that key.

34:29.525 --> 34:32.320
I've got witnesses
to back me up on this.

34:32.402 --> 34:34.280
In fact,
Muntz is willing to testify

34:34.362 --> 34:36.824
that you put a 30-amp fuse

34:36.908 --> 34:39.284
{\an1}in a 15-amp socket
in a 70-year-old house!

34:39.368 --> 34:41.161
What do you want from me?

34:41.245 --> 34:42.413
It's over, man!
It's history!

34:42.496 --> 34:43.581
It's not over!

34:43.664 --> 34:46.667
We got two years probation,
we got community service,

34:46.751 --> 34:48.002
{\an3}and I can't even...!
Hey,

34:48.085 --> 34:49.879
if that's all
you're worried about, relax.

34:49.962 --> 34:51.297
We'll never have
to do those hours.

34:51.380 --> 34:53.341
We got a court clerk
in our hip pocket

34:53.424 --> 34:55.592
who'll be more than happy
to help us out with that.

34:57.220 --> 35:01.307
You know what, I was gonna give
you till this weekend

35:01.390 --> 35:03.351
to move out,
but I just changed my mind.

35:03.434 --> 35:06.521
You got one day
to get the hell out of here.

35:06.604 --> 35:09.690
{\an1}Or what?

35:09.774 --> 35:12.318
This is what.

35:12.401 --> 35:14.695
First, I'm gonna bash in
your head,

35:14.779 --> 35:16.864
and then I'm gonna squeeze
your neck so hard

35:16.948 --> 35:18.366
your head's gonna pop off.

35:18.449 --> 35:20.034
{\an1}You think
I'm kidding?

35:20.117 --> 35:20.868
You wanna try me?

35:20.952 --> 35:22.245
Huh?! Huh?!

35:22.328 --> 35:23.371
{\an3}All right!

35:23.454 --> 35:25.456
All right!

35:27.792 --> 35:29.877
I'm outta here.

35:29.961 --> 35:33.422
You best be gone
by the time I get back.

35:40.096 --> 35:41.514
(doorbell rings)

35:55.486 --> 35:56.487
Hi.

35:58.531 --> 36:00.700
I'll only stay a minute.

36:03.494 --> 36:06.372
{\an1}I wanted to clear things up
with you before I leave.

36:06.455 --> 36:09.876
Brandon told me how upset
you were that I was here,

36:09.959 --> 36:12.503
which I totally understand...

36:12.587 --> 36:14.630
I mean,
the old girlfriend thing.

36:14.714 --> 36:19.051
As I recall, you weren't just
any old girlfriend to him.

36:19.135 --> 36:21.304
Maybe not.

36:21.387 --> 36:23.472
I'd like to think not.

36:23.556 --> 36:26.267
So, you're still interested
in him, right?

36:26.350 --> 36:28.519
He's a pretty incredible guy...

36:30.354 --> 36:33.107
and I would be interested
except for one thing.

36:33.190 --> 36:34.901
And what's that?

36:34.984 --> 36:36.068
The burn victim?

36:36.152 --> 36:38.821
You see, that's exactly what
I was afraid you'd think;

36:38.905 --> 36:41.657
that he's staying with you
out of pity,

36:41.741 --> 36:43.117
which he definitely isn't.

36:43.201 --> 36:45.077
How do you know?

36:45.161 --> 36:47.121
Kelly, he's in love with you.

36:47.204 --> 36:50.625
He told me that
before the fire.

36:50.708 --> 36:51.709
Really?

36:51.792 --> 36:53.252
Would I make that up?

36:55.588 --> 36:59.091
I guess you've changed a lot
since I saw you last.

36:59.175 --> 37:05.139
Listen, um, you don't have
to tell him I was here.

37:05.222 --> 37:07.767
{\an1}I mean, you can do
whatever you want, but...

37:07.850 --> 37:10.561
don't tell him.

37:14.273 --> 37:18.361
♪ Everything is right
where it should be... ♪

37:21.197 --> 37:24.367
{\an1}Okay, buck and a half,
double gimbal on the hop. Eh!

37:32.083 --> 37:33.334
(doorbell rings)

37:33.417 --> 37:34.669
I'll get it.

37:37.755 --> 37:39.966
{\an3}Steve, I was getting
worried about you.

37:40.049 --> 37:42.468
{\an1}Hi. Thanks.
Um, I can't stay.

37:42.551 --> 37:45.346
{\an1}I just wanted
to drop this off.

37:45.429 --> 37:46.973
Come on, Steve,
you've gotta come in.

37:47.056 --> 37:48.307
I'd like to, but I can't.

37:48.391 --> 37:49.642
I'm not doing so well.

37:49.725 --> 37:51.352
The case?

37:51.435 --> 37:52.520
Yeah.

37:52.603 --> 37:54.480
Steve, where are you gonna go?

37:54.563 --> 37:57.191
You should talk to Jesse.

38:00.319 --> 38:03.406
Save me one
of them "lat cakes," okay?

38:03.489 --> 38:04.365
{\an3}Latkes.

38:04.448 --> 38:05.866
{\an1}Latkes.

38:09.078 --> 38:10.871
So how did she seem to you?

38:10.955 --> 38:13.541
{\an4}Like she'd really like
to see you show up
on her doorstep.

38:13.624 --> 38:15.668
I'm on my way, then.

38:15.751 --> 38:17.044
Thanks for the game, kids.

38:17.128 --> 38:18.462
It's been a lot of fun.

38:20.506 --> 38:22.591
{\an1}If I had knew about
that condition

38:22.675 --> 38:23.676
in the first place,

38:23.759 --> 38:28.264
I never would have agreed
to waive my rights, never.

38:28.347 --> 38:29.765
Oh, I don't know.

38:29.849 --> 38:32.893
{\an3}Maybe Mr. Ted Stone would've
made it worth your while.

38:32.977 --> 38:37.523
{\an1}And give up on the one thing
that was most important to me?

38:37.606 --> 38:38.941
No way.

38:39.025 --> 38:41.902
Steve, buddy,

38:41.986 --> 38:44.238
{\an3}let me tell ya
about my day, okay?

38:44.321 --> 38:47.116
{\an3}I'll just give you
the back story.

38:47.199 --> 38:50.411
A single father tries to get
by on a factory worker's pay.

38:50.494 --> 38:53.080
One night he trusts
the wrong baby-sitter,

38:53.164 --> 38:55.458
and his kids get picked up
by the cops

38:55.541 --> 38:56.625
for their own protection.

38:56.709 --> 38:59.420
Well, when the social worker
looks into it, she decides

38:59.503 --> 39:01.505
there's no adequate
stable childcare,

39:01.589 --> 39:04.258
so the judge throws them into
a foster home for three months.

39:04.341 --> 39:06.969
It's three months.
It's not like it's two years.

39:07.053 --> 39:08.220
For this family,
it might as well be forever

39:08.304 --> 39:09.221
because the father
doesn't ever think

39:09.305 --> 39:10.181
he's gonna see his kids again.

39:10.264 --> 39:12.433
Just explain to him
they're in a foster...

39:12.516 --> 39:14.268
I can't explain nothin' to him,
now, man!

39:14.351 --> 39:15.603
He be gone.
He be outta here!

39:15.686 --> 39:17.480
He went to that

39:17.563 --> 39:19.106
foster home,
put his kids in his car

39:19.190 --> 39:20.357
and drove 'em back to Mexico.

39:22.026 --> 39:24.070
This system is so screwed up.

39:24.153 --> 39:30.618
{\an5}(chuckling):
Hey, wait, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

39:30.701 --> 39:33.996
{\an3}This system works great
for some people, man.

39:34.080 --> 39:37.333
I don't hear Griffin or
Ted Stone complaining.

39:37.416 --> 39:39.752
You really, really think
you got ripped off, don't you?

39:39.835 --> 39:41.462
Yeah, I do.

39:41.545 --> 39:42.963
Well, maybe you did,

39:43.047 --> 39:44.465
but I'll just bet you,

39:44.548 --> 39:46.884
{\an3}I bet you if you weren't
a rich white boy,

39:46.967 --> 39:48.135
you'd be sittin' in jail

39:48.219 --> 39:50.429
right about now.

39:50.513 --> 39:51.847
So don't you ever, ever tell me

39:51.931 --> 39:54.350
what a screwed-up system
we have, do you hear me?

39:57.394 --> 39:58.687
Cheers.

40:09.365 --> 40:10.658
(knocking, door creaks)

40:12.618 --> 40:14.620
Oh, you scared me!

40:14.703 --> 40:17.331
Well, I certainly didn't mean
to do that.

40:17.414 --> 40:18.332
Clare gave me the key.

40:18.415 --> 40:19.875
I brought you these.

40:19.959 --> 40:22.795
{\an3}Thank you.

40:22.878 --> 40:24.213
{\an3}Come here.

40:27.383 --> 40:28.425
I love you.

40:37.476 --> 40:40.020
{\an1}See, now, I came over here
to apologize to you.

40:40.104 --> 40:42.523
You're making it
very easy on me.

40:42.606 --> 40:43.732
What happened?

40:43.816 --> 40:47.820
I don't know. Time heals
all wounds I guess.

40:47.903 --> 40:49.905
How you feeling?

40:49.989 --> 40:53.409
Terrible.

40:53.492 --> 40:57.371
Tired, but I'm glad
you're here.

40:57.454 --> 40:59.373
Anything I can do for you?

40:59.456 --> 41:03.210
Just stay with me
till I fall asleep, okay?

41:04.795 --> 41:06.255
You got it.

41:16.307 --> 41:17.558
Oh, Eduardo.

41:24.440 --> 41:26.692
Thanks for coming.

41:26.775 --> 41:29.236
{\an3}Here's the money
I owe you.

41:29.320 --> 41:32.740
You, uh, want me
to say thank you now?

41:32.823 --> 41:35.409
No, I just want to apologize

41:35.492 --> 41:38.287
for the way I treated you
the other day,

41:38.370 --> 41:40.414
and I want to acknowledge
all the hard work

41:40.498 --> 41:41.415
you did for the party.

41:41.498 --> 41:43.918
You liked the food?

41:44.001 --> 41:48.297
Yeah. In fact, I'll recommend
you to other people.

41:48.380 --> 41:51.008
You got my number.

41:58.474 --> 42:02.436
Wait a minute.

42:02.519 --> 42:04.438
There's too much in here.

42:04.521 --> 42:09.735
Yeah, that's a, that's a bonus.

42:09.818 --> 42:11.153
Just my way of saying thanks.

42:11.237 --> 42:12.446
You're serious?

42:12.529 --> 42:15.115
I never kid about money.

42:17.409 --> 42:18.786
<i>Gracias,</i> Steve.

42:18.869 --> 42:21.372
<i>De nada,</i> Eduardo.

42:30.089 --> 42:31.632
{\an1}Oh, they're coming,
they're coming!

42:33.717 --> 42:35.928
{\an3}There's no place
like home, eh?

42:36.011 --> 42:38.973
{\an1}Yeah, this isn't my home.
I mean, flowers?

42:39.056 --> 42:40.849
{\an3}BOTH:
Surprise!

42:40.933 --> 42:43.018
Welcome home, Dylan.

42:43.102 --> 42:45.980
Thanks.
So this was all your idea?

42:46.063 --> 42:47.773
No, no, actually,
it was Valerie's.

42:47.856 --> 42:49.984
Actually, it was
Nat and my idea.

42:50.067 --> 42:52.152
But the cake is all Cindy's.

42:55.072 --> 42:57.324
All right, break out
the forks, babe.

42:57.408 --> 43:00.828
{\an1}Oh, listen, um, I sorted
out your mail.

43:00.911 --> 43:04.331
{\an1}Junk mail, magazines,
catalogues, bills.

43:04.415 --> 43:06.292
{\an1}Oh, and your
personal stuff.

43:06.375 --> 43:07.918
{\an1}NAT:
Everybody's askin' for ya.

43:08.002 --> 43:09.670
{\an1}And Willie and
Nadine wanted to come,

43:09.753 --> 43:11.213
{\an1}but somebody's
gotta mind the store.

43:11.297 --> 43:13.799
{\an4}But I told 'em
your second stop
would be the Peach Pit.

43:13.882 --> 43:15.509
So what are your
plans now, Dylan?

43:15.592 --> 43:18.012
Well, I'm just gonna take it
one day at a time.

43:18.095 --> 43:21.181
Who the hell do I know
in Michigan?

43:22.266 --> 43:25.019
{\an1}Mm! Cindy,
this is very good.

43:25.102 --> 43:26.312
If you ever need a job.

43:26.395 --> 43:27.313
Call me.

43:27.396 --> 43:28.564
(Nat laughs)

43:31.400 --> 43:33.360
What's the matter?

43:35.779 --> 43:39.158
{\an3}You look like you've
seen a ghost.

43:39.241 --> 43:42.703
{\an1}This is from some lady
in Michigan.

43:42.786 --> 43:43.746
"Dear Mr. McKay,

43:43.829 --> 43:45.331
"I recently took
a business trip

43:45.414 --> 43:47.541
{\an1}"and came across this note
in my carry-on bag.

43:47.625 --> 43:48.709
"I originally found it

43:48.792 --> 43:50.836
{\an1}in a bathroom stall
at the L.A. airport."

43:50.919 --> 43:53.797
{\an1}VALERIE:
What's it say?

43:55.424 --> 43:57.176
It's from Erica.
