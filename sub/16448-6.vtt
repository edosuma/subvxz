WEBVTT

00:02.936 --> 00:04.538
Hey, Jack.
How was school?

00:04.605 --> 00:06.274
I went.

00:06.340 --> 00:07.908
Whoa!
Spoiler alert!

00:07.975 --> 00:09.843
Save some
for the movie.

00:11.612 --> 00:13.647
Hey, what is that smell?
I'm starving.

00:13.714 --> 00:14.915
Oh, I brought leftover pizza
from Enzo's.

00:14.982 --> 00:16.117
It's in the microwave.

00:16.184 --> 00:17.485
Awesome.

00:17.551 --> 00:19.420
It has pineapple
on it.

00:26.127 --> 00:28.096
We've been
through this.

00:29.797 --> 00:31.499
There's a meatball hero
in the fridge.

00:31.565 --> 00:33.234
Okay, we're back
on good terms.

00:33.301 --> 00:34.468
My daddy didn't raise
no fool.

00:34.535 --> 00:36.003
That's right.

00:36.070 --> 00:38.539
Ahh.

00:38.606 --> 00:40.741
All right, what do we
got going on with
your fiance here?

00:40.808 --> 00:43.477
I'm coloring in
a coloring book for grown-ups.

00:45.313 --> 00:46.947
Yeah, it's really popular
right now.

00:47.014 --> 00:48.149
You know,
it helps relieve stress.

00:48.216 --> 00:50.284
Yeah, 'cause not working
and living rent-free

00:50.351 --> 00:52.019
takes a toll.

00:52.086 --> 00:53.921
It also helps
with his creativity

00:53.987 --> 00:55.689
to, you know,
develop his app.

00:55.756 --> 00:58.492
Yes, I find that coloring
inside the lines

00:58.559 --> 01:01.061
helps me think outside
of the box.

01:03.831 --> 01:05.666
I'm really
trying to like you.

01:08.001 --> 01:09.403
Hi, guys.
Hey.
Hey.

01:09.470 --> 01:11.071
Hey.
Great news.

01:11.139 --> 01:12.773
I found a new kid.

01:12.840 --> 01:15.876
Well, we're out of bedrooms,
so you got to return him.
No --

01:15.943 --> 01:17.445
No,
Jack needs a friend.

01:17.511 --> 01:18.812
This kid,
he could be the one.

01:18.879 --> 01:20.948
Listen --
Grayden Margolis.

01:21.014 --> 01:22.716
Does not play sports --
check.

01:22.783 --> 01:24.318
Mild anxiety --
check.

01:24.385 --> 01:26.053
Unhealthy interest
in video games.

01:26.120 --> 01:27.255
This kid is perfect.

01:27.321 --> 01:29.056
Wait, Mom, how do you know
all of this?

01:29.123 --> 01:30.624
He came into
the nurse's office.

01:30.691 --> 01:33.194
He seemed like a good fit,
so I made copies
of his records.

01:35.028 --> 01:36.997
Okay,
that's mildly illegal.

01:37.064 --> 01:38.866
Oh, yeah.
Big trouble if I get caught.

01:40.033 --> 01:42.370
For the fish's fins,

01:42.436 --> 01:44.938
raspberry rave
or pumpkin?

01:46.307 --> 01:47.408
He's killing me.

01:49.009 --> 01:50.311
Anyway,
here's the plan.

01:50.378 --> 01:52.613
His family just moved into
that huge house on Maple,

01:52.680 --> 01:55.183
so take Jack over there for
a little meet and greet, hmm?

01:55.249 --> 01:57.050
Honey, you can't force
this stuff, all right?

01:57.117 --> 01:58.252
Jack's got to do that
on his own.

01:58.319 --> 02:00.321
No, come on.
He's shy.

02:00.388 --> 02:02.490
Ever since Robbie Becksford
moved away,

02:02.556 --> 02:04.992
all he does is sit
on the couch and watch
The Weather Channel.

02:05.058 --> 02:06.494
You know he wants to be
a meteorologist.

02:06.560 --> 02:08.396
Yes. He insists I call him
Jack Thunder.

02:11.232 --> 02:12.633
He's gonna be fine, okay?

02:12.700 --> 02:14.168
Actually,
I wouldn't worry.

02:14.235 --> 02:17.238
I was a lot like Jack
at his age,

02:17.305 --> 02:19.607
and I think that
I turned out pretty --

02:19.673 --> 02:22.176
Jack! Let's roll!

02:22.243 --> 02:27.181
* I am not your ordinary guy

02:27.248 --> 02:29.082
Come on, kid.

02:29.149 --> 02:30.518
I know you're in there.

02:30.584 --> 02:35.389
* Grayden

02:35.456 --> 02:40.328
* Come out
and play-ay *

02:41.329 --> 02:43.331
This is creepy, Dad.

02:43.397 --> 02:45.766
No, it'd be creepy
if you weren't here

02:45.833 --> 02:47.868
and this was a van.

02:47.935 --> 02:50.271
Ooh.

02:50.338 --> 02:52.440
Looky, looky.

02:52.506 --> 02:55.209
Spider caught himself
a fly.

02:55.276 --> 02:56.344
Get going. Go.

02:56.410 --> 02:58.045
What if he doesn't
like me?

02:58.111 --> 03:00.648
What are you talking about?
You're funny.

03:00.714 --> 03:02.650
You got a remote-controlled
helicopter.

03:02.716 --> 03:05.553
You know a ton
about the Doppler radar.

03:05.619 --> 03:06.620
He's gonna love you.

03:06.687 --> 03:08.656
You think so?
Absolutely.

03:08.722 --> 03:11.492
That personality right there,
that's all you need.

03:11.559 --> 03:13.461
And the helicopter. Make sure
you hold the helicopter up.

03:13.527 --> 03:15.028
Get it up, higher.
There you go.

03:15.095 --> 03:16.897
Go, go.

03:16.964 --> 03:19.700
( Indistinct shouting,
laughter )

03:19.767 --> 03:22.670
Aww, Jack and Grayden
are having such a good time.

03:22.736 --> 03:24.605
Great job
on the stakeout.

03:24.672 --> 03:26.106
Well, I can't take
all the credit.

03:26.173 --> 03:27.608
You're the one
who hacked into his file.

03:27.675 --> 03:29.076
Yeah.

03:29.142 --> 03:31.345
All part
of being a mom.

03:31.412 --> 03:32.480
( Doorbell rings )

03:32.546 --> 03:33.814
Oh, that must be Grayden's
parents.

03:33.881 --> 03:35.483
I'll get it.

03:37.251 --> 03:38.486
Hi.
Hi, I'm Brandi.

03:38.552 --> 03:40.020
We spoke
on the phone.
Hi. Donna.

03:40.087 --> 03:41.722
Hey, what do we
got here?

03:41.789 --> 03:43.056
( Chuckles )

03:43.123 --> 03:44.992
Hey.
Look at this place.

03:45.058 --> 03:47.094
Nice.
Very nice.

03:47.160 --> 03:48.195
Hey,
Vic Margolis.

03:48.262 --> 03:49.263
Hey, I'm Kevin.
Nice to see you.

03:49.330 --> 03:51.865
We got a big on here,
honey, huh?

03:51.932 --> 03:53.233
We know where to go
when we can't get

03:53.301 --> 03:54.702
our suitcase
closed now.

03:54.768 --> 03:56.036
( Laughs )

03:57.338 --> 03:59.039
Kevin, this is Grayden's
stepmom

03:59.106 --> 04:01.842
and the result of my obvious
midlife crisis.

04:01.909 --> 04:03.143
( Chuckles )

04:03.210 --> 04:04.612
It was me
or the yellow Porsche.

04:04.678 --> 04:07.247
Yeah.
Well, I got both.

04:07.315 --> 04:08.382
I got neither.

04:08.449 --> 04:09.550
( Laughs )

04:09.617 --> 04:11.084
No, I got this.

04:11.151 --> 04:12.953
Her, you. I got --

04:14.154 --> 04:16.023
I love you so much.

04:17.291 --> 04:19.126
You have
a lovely home.
Thank you.

04:19.192 --> 04:21.094
Yeah, we just bought
that big-ass monster

04:21.161 --> 04:22.162
down on the corner.

04:22.229 --> 04:23.764
You did it right.
You did it right.

04:23.831 --> 04:26.166
Great neighborhood,
average house.

04:26.233 --> 04:27.468
Oh.

04:27.535 --> 04:28.802
Th-Thank you.

04:28.869 --> 04:30.738
Yeah. Uh, well, I'll get
Grayden so you guys

04:30.804 --> 04:33.507
can get back
to your big-ass monster.

04:33.574 --> 04:35.676
Oh. It looks like the boys are
having so much fun out there.

04:35.743 --> 04:37.311
And we got nowhere to go.
Let them play.

04:38.312 --> 04:39.447
Donna:
O-Okay, all right.

04:39.513 --> 04:41.449
Uh, well, I could put on
some coffee.

04:41.515 --> 04:43.984
I could do coffee,
if by coffee you mean wine.

04:44.051 --> 04:45.453
Um, it's a little early.

04:45.519 --> 04:48.356
Yikes.
I'm two glasses in already.

04:48.422 --> 04:50.290
Wel-- Yes.
See what we've got.
Vic:
Hey, do me a favor.

04:50.358 --> 04:52.292
Could you top off
the pistachios?

04:52.360 --> 04:53.794
I go through
these like butter.

04:53.861 --> 04:55.629
I love these things.
Like, they're crazy.

04:55.696 --> 04:57.264
It's like crack.

04:58.366 --> 05:01.502
Mmm. I tell ya,
here's what I love.

05:01.569 --> 05:03.371
Sometimes you get one
without a shell.

05:03.437 --> 05:04.672
You get a naked one.

05:04.738 --> 05:07.708
It's like -- It's like God
saying, "That's on me.

05:07.775 --> 05:09.109
That's on me."

05:09.176 --> 05:12.179
**

05:12.245 --> 05:15.148
I got to be honest,
wherever I go,

05:15.215 --> 05:16.950
I'm the top salesman.

05:17.017 --> 05:18.986
Kevin: Really?
Oh, yeah.

05:19.052 --> 05:21.655
And you know why?
It's 'cause I'm genuine.

05:24.625 --> 05:26.760
And -- And they get it.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.429
They get that. You know
what I'm talking about?

05:28.496 --> 05:30.197
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:31.198 --> 05:33.333
Thank you.

05:33.401 --> 05:36.570
But, you know,
when it's all said and done,

05:36.637 --> 05:38.506
is -- is money
gonna make me happy?

05:38.572 --> 05:43.243
I mean, do I really
need a putting green
in my backyard?

05:43.310 --> 05:46.447
Do I really need
a heated toilet seat?

05:46.514 --> 05:49.249
I don't know. I just heat mine
up with the back of my legs.

05:51.652 --> 05:53.887
I mean, sure,
Paris is nice...
Mm-hmm.

05:53.954 --> 05:56.056
...but give me Barcelona
any day.

05:56.123 --> 05:58.826
Oh, right. I've heard
Barcelona is incredible.

05:58.892 --> 06:02.295
Bar-tha-lona.

06:02.362 --> 06:05.365
Right.
Bar-tha-lona.

06:06.667 --> 06:08.168
And I'm telling you,
you have to go.

06:08.235 --> 06:09.803
Oh, well, if you're buying,
I'm going.

06:09.870 --> 06:11.338
Girls weekend.

06:11.405 --> 06:13.240
You are so funny.
Oh.

06:13.306 --> 06:15.342
But you must.
Promise me you'll go.

06:15.409 --> 06:16.510
Okay.

06:16.577 --> 06:17.978
Don't just say okay.
Promise.

06:18.045 --> 06:19.447
We're a family
of five.

06:19.513 --> 06:21.248
Tickets to Spain
would be pretty --

06:21.314 --> 06:23.283
Promise me!
I promise.

06:25.118 --> 06:27.988
Whether you're a cop
or you're a salesman,

06:28.055 --> 06:31.324
whatever you're doing in life,
key to success is hard work.

06:31.391 --> 06:32.593
Am I right?
Absolutely.

06:32.660 --> 06:33.994
You got to put in
the hours.

06:34.061 --> 06:35.663
No, no, no, no.

06:35.729 --> 06:37.665
It's not about
the hours.

06:37.731 --> 06:39.132
It's about
working smart.

06:39.199 --> 06:40.300
Right.

06:40.367 --> 06:41.635
Making sure
you're not wasting time.

06:41.702 --> 06:45.238
No, no, no,
no, no.

06:45.305 --> 06:47.775
'Cause sometimes
when you're wasting time,
you're actually --

06:47.841 --> 06:49.910
you're finding
a path to the solution.

06:49.977 --> 06:51.445
Ah.

06:51.512 --> 06:53.814
So, even if you think
you're doing something wrong,

06:53.881 --> 06:55.983
you're actually doing
something right.

06:57.384 --> 06:58.852
No!

07:00.488 --> 07:01.822
Yep, I do, I do.

07:01.889 --> 07:05.493
I swear on the kids' lives
I will watch "Ray Donovan."

07:05.559 --> 07:08.361
( Laughs ) Look at these two.
Thick as thieves, huh?

07:08.428 --> 07:11.565
Anyway, it's been really great
getting to know you guys.

07:11.632 --> 07:12.666
Yeah.
Uh-oh, what is that?

07:12.733 --> 07:14.034
The wrap-up music?

07:14.101 --> 07:15.703
'Cause, you know, I still got
a lot of people to thank

07:15.769 --> 07:16.804
and, uh...

07:16.870 --> 07:19.139
No, no, I just --
I don't -- I was --

07:19.206 --> 07:20.373
Grayden:
Can I sleep over?

07:20.440 --> 07:22.109
Please? Please?
We want to play "Mario Kart."

07:22.175 --> 07:23.811
Um...

07:23.877 --> 07:26.213
Oh, it's up to
Mr. and Mrs. Gable, champ.

07:26.279 --> 07:27.815
Well, we'd love to have him
over,

07:27.881 --> 07:29.617
but, you know, Grayden
didn't bring his pajamas.

07:29.683 --> 07:31.719
Yeah, you know,
I guess we'll --
we'll do it another night.

07:31.785 --> 07:32.953
Yeah.

07:33.020 --> 07:34.187
He could just borrow
Jack's PJs.

07:34.254 --> 07:36.056
Ah, he could just sleep
in his tighty-whities.

07:37.290 --> 07:39.026
Well, that solves that.

07:39.092 --> 07:41.461
Well, awesome!
Yes!

07:41.529 --> 07:44.397
I guess that means
another glass of wine.

07:44.464 --> 07:46.333
( Chuckles ) Yeah.
Looks that way.

07:46.399 --> 07:47.501
Vic: This is crazy.

07:47.568 --> 07:49.036
We don't even have
cable yet

07:49.102 --> 07:51.905
and already we got
two new besties here.

07:51.972 --> 07:53.741
Cable's great, huh?

07:53.807 --> 07:55.008
By the way,
when you get it,

07:55.075 --> 07:57.878
we'll understand if we don't
see you for a while.

08:03.416 --> 08:05.218
I'm so tired,
by 1:00 a.m.,

08:05.285 --> 08:07.420
I'm not even talking
to him anymore.

08:07.487 --> 08:09.623
I'm talking directly
to the man bun.

08:09.690 --> 08:12.893
I'm not 100% positive,
but I think he can wag it.

08:14.327 --> 08:15.929
If you have to put
the word "man"

08:15.996 --> 08:18.131
in the name of a hairstyle,
shouldn't be on a man.

08:18.198 --> 08:19.432
Yeah.
Yeah.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.969
I got to tell you, and they
are brutal, and the wife?

08:22.035 --> 08:24.504
( Scoffs ) 45 minutes
on how shopping local

08:24.572 --> 08:26.206
is different
than shopping organic.

08:26.273 --> 08:28.909
I don't want to sound
like a broken record,

08:28.976 --> 08:31.579
but...white people.

08:34.047 --> 08:35.849
Wa-whoa.
Man bun, 3:00.

08:35.916 --> 08:36.950
Yeah.
Very funny.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.886
There he is!
Hey, there he is.

08:38.952 --> 08:41.321
( Laughs )

08:41.388 --> 08:42.489
What are you doing here, man?
How'd you find me?

08:42.556 --> 08:44.124
Oh, Jack told me
this was your --

08:44.191 --> 08:45.358
your --
your hangout, huh?

08:45.425 --> 08:48.128
This your crew?
All right.

08:48.195 --> 08:49.663
This is my oldest,
Braden.

08:49.730 --> 08:52.966
Little souvenir
from wife numero uno.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.702
Dad, Mom has a name.

08:54.768 --> 08:57.037
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's Allie.

08:57.104 --> 08:59.472
Allie-mony.
( Laughs )

09:00.941 --> 09:02.375
Go get
some slices.
Okay.

09:02.442 --> 09:03.476
Slide over,
will you.
Whoa.

09:03.543 --> 09:04.712
So, listen,
tonight

09:04.778 --> 09:06.780
I'm thinking
7:00, 7:30?

09:06.847 --> 09:09.617
Huh?
Yeah, for dinner.
We're going for dinner.

09:09.683 --> 09:10.718
We're going for dinner --
Indian.

09:10.784 --> 09:12.552
Oh, man.
Oh, you know what it is?

09:12.620 --> 09:14.287
Uh, Donna's
a school nurse

09:14.354 --> 09:16.724
and tonight
she's giving a seminar.

09:16.790 --> 09:19.326
Think you got your dates mixed
up a little because Brandi,

09:19.392 --> 09:21.695
she just talked to Donna
and she's available,

09:21.762 --> 09:22.763
so you're in.

09:22.830 --> 09:24.798
Indian!
Ah! I love it!

09:24.865 --> 09:28.135
**

09:32.139 --> 09:33.273
( Gasps ) Oh!

09:34.642 --> 09:36.944
There you are.
Hey, Brandi.

09:37.010 --> 09:40.714
Hey. Sorry, what --
what are you d-doing here?

09:40.781 --> 09:42.082
Oh, I didn't mean
to startle you.

09:42.149 --> 09:43.516
Your daughter said
you were up here.

09:43.583 --> 09:46.519
I was calling for you.
I was like, "Donna, Donna!"

09:48.488 --> 09:50.824
You weren't answering.
I was worried.

09:50.891 --> 09:52.025
Well,
I was in the shower.

09:52.092 --> 09:54.928
It's usually
a private thing.

09:54.995 --> 09:56.363
Anyway, I just wanted
to let you know

09:56.429 --> 09:57.998
the restaurant
is totally cazh.

09:58.065 --> 09:59.132
The restaurant?

09:59.199 --> 10:01.034
Yeah, we're going
to dinner -- Indian.

10:01.101 --> 10:03.236
This place has the best
tandoori chicken.

10:03.303 --> 10:04.772
Oh, I don't --
I really don't think we can.

10:04.838 --> 10:06.439
Kevin has --
No, Vic already
talked to him.

10:06.506 --> 10:07.540
He said
you're good to go.

10:07.607 --> 10:09.209
Did he now?
Yep.

10:09.276 --> 10:12.179
Okay.
Now, promise me you'll get
the tandoori chicken.

10:12.245 --> 10:14.381
I promise.

10:14.447 --> 10:17.384
**

10:17.450 --> 10:19.787
Oh, that was the most brutal
dinner ever.

10:19.853 --> 10:20.954
( Sighs )

10:21.021 --> 10:22.022
Three hours of him

10:22.089 --> 10:23.891
disagreeing
with everything I said.

10:23.957 --> 10:25.659
I was like,
"The sky's blue."

10:25.726 --> 10:30.798
He was like,
(As Vic) "No! It's green!"

10:30.864 --> 10:33.901
Well, next time,
don't say yes to dinner.

10:33.967 --> 10:36.269
Me?
He said you agreed.

10:36.336 --> 10:37.404
No, she said you...

10:38.772 --> 10:40.007
Oh, they played us.

10:40.073 --> 10:43.143
Like a banjo!
Oh!

10:43.210 --> 10:44.211
We got
to cut them loose!

10:44.277 --> 10:45.679
How are we
gonna do that?

10:45.746 --> 10:48.048
We don't answer their calls.
We don't return their texts.

10:48.115 --> 10:50.718
I mean, this is a woman who
followed me into the bathroom.

10:50.784 --> 10:53.420
Oh, and did you know that they
want to take us snowmobiling?

10:53.486 --> 10:54.888
I may have agreed
with that.

10:54.955 --> 10:55.956
What?

10:56.023 --> 10:58.025
I like playing
in the snow.

10:59.326 --> 11:00.660
No, babe, face it.

11:00.728 --> 11:02.495
As long as Jack and Grayden
are friends,

11:02.562 --> 11:04.865
then we are
stuck with them.

11:04.932 --> 11:07.534
We're gonna end up going
to Bar-tha-lona.

11:10.037 --> 11:11.338
Unless...

11:11.404 --> 11:12.672
Unless what?

11:12.740 --> 11:13.941
Nothing.

11:14.007 --> 11:15.976
Just saying
if something happened

11:16.043 --> 11:20.480
and Jack and that kid...
weren't friends.

11:20.547 --> 11:22.750
What are you
proposing?

11:22.816 --> 11:25.418
I'm not proposing anything.
I'm "what if'ing."

11:25.485 --> 11:28.055
What if
we did something

11:28.121 --> 11:30.290
and Jack and Grayden

11:30.357 --> 11:33.293
were no longer friends.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.195
Break them up?

11:37.664 --> 11:38.866
That would solve
all of our problems.

11:38.932 --> 11:40.567
Right?
It is so doable.

11:40.633 --> 11:42.736
It's easy. It's easy.
Oh, my God.
It's so easy.

11:42.803 --> 11:44.537
It's so eas--
( Gasps )

11:44.604 --> 11:46.907
Oh, my God. What are we --
We're -- We're
horrible parents!

11:46.974 --> 11:48.241
Oh.
Oh.

11:48.308 --> 11:49.376
We are horrible
people.

11:49.442 --> 11:50.510
Yes.
Yeah.

11:50.577 --> 11:51.945
I'm disgusting
for thinking that!

11:52.012 --> 11:53.313
Disgusting!

11:53.380 --> 11:54.982
Because this
is about Jack.
Yes.

11:55.048 --> 11:56.516
And his happiness.
Yes.

11:56.583 --> 11:59.352
You know, and if we have to
suffer through Vic and Brandi,

11:59.419 --> 12:01.421
then that's what
we got to do.

12:02.756 --> 12:04.958
Unless...
Unless what?

12:07.127 --> 12:08.962
We find Jack
another friend.

12:09.029 --> 12:11.364
A better friend.

12:11.431 --> 12:13.266
Way better.
Yeah.

12:13.333 --> 12:15.135
Robert Becksford,
hmm?

12:15.202 --> 12:16.937
Jack loved him.

12:17.004 --> 12:18.738
But he lives all the way
in Brooklyn now.

12:18.806 --> 12:20.673
They can fill the Belt Parkway
with broken glass

12:20.740 --> 12:23.010
and I will crawl over it
to pick him up.

12:27.380 --> 12:28.949
Hey, babe,
what's your 20?

12:29.016 --> 12:30.150
Just got to Brooklyn.

12:30.217 --> 12:33.120
I'm about to pick up
the package.

12:33.186 --> 12:35.055
Okay, here's the plan.

12:35.122 --> 12:37.690
I'm about to hide the game
and initiate code name

12:37.757 --> 12:39.492
"Bye-bye Grayden."

12:39.559 --> 12:41.594
Now, I'm not a cop,
but maybe you shouldn't have

12:41.661 --> 12:43.496
the kid's name
in the code name?

12:43.563 --> 12:44.932
Ooh, good catch.

12:44.998 --> 12:46.499
Yeah, I got
a little sloppy there.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.769
Oh, got to go.
Elvis is in the building.

12:54.241 --> 12:55.742
Hey, pal.
What are you doing?

12:55.809 --> 12:57.010
Heard Grayden's
coming over.

12:57.077 --> 12:58.979
Boy, you better practice
your "Mario Kart."

12:59.046 --> 13:01.048
I don't need to.
Sure about that?

13:01.114 --> 13:02.149
The last time
you played,

13:02.215 --> 13:04.484
it was kind of
a one-sided beatdown.

13:04.551 --> 13:06.053
I mean, I love you,

13:06.119 --> 13:08.755
but when he lapped you
as Princess Peach,

13:08.822 --> 13:10.490
it's kind of hard to watch.

13:12.492 --> 13:14.694
Maybe I should practice.
There you go.

13:21.869 --> 13:22.903
What's up, buddy?

13:22.970 --> 13:25.338
My game's gone.
What?

13:27.407 --> 13:28.575
Wow.

13:28.641 --> 13:30.944
Wow, it's --
it's probably nothing,

13:31.011 --> 13:32.980
but the other day,
I saw Grayden,

13:33.046 --> 13:34.915
he had it in his hand
and he said,

13:34.982 --> 13:36.683
"I wish this was mine."

13:38.251 --> 13:40.087
You think Grayden
stole it?
No, no, no, no.

13:40.153 --> 13:44.324
I mean, everything
does point to him, but no.

13:44.391 --> 13:46.126
No, no.
I don't think so.

13:46.193 --> 13:48.161
What I would do, though,
is I would check your room,

13:48.228 --> 13:49.229
make sure you still got

13:49.296 --> 13:50.898
all your stuff up there,
you know?

13:50.964 --> 13:53.233
If he took anything,
we're done.

13:53.300 --> 13:55.035
Whoa, those are some
tough words.

13:55.102 --> 13:58.605
But necessary. I mean,
that's -- You got to do...

14:00.840 --> 14:02.209
Ding-dong,
ding-dong!

14:02.275 --> 14:05.278
Hey!
Come on in.

14:05.345 --> 14:06.914
Kid delivery.
Where's Grayden?

14:06.980 --> 14:08.415
He's in the car.
He's getting his backpack.

14:08.481 --> 14:10.918
And, uh, listen,
this is just a drop-off.

14:10.984 --> 14:12.119
Can't hang out,
unfortunately.

14:12.185 --> 14:13.887
No.
Yeah.

14:13.954 --> 14:15.822
Well, this is our busiest week
of the year.

14:15.889 --> 14:18.825
We're -- We're blowing out
all the 2016 hot tubs.

14:18.892 --> 14:20.293
The show room
is mobbed.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.595
I got to get back there.
You know, I'm the guy.

14:24.397 --> 14:27.067
You sell hot tubs?
Yeah, down at
Crazy Leo's,

14:27.134 --> 14:29.236
who, by the way,
is crazy.

14:29.302 --> 14:30.737
He really is crazy.

14:32.172 --> 14:34.674
Hey, buddy.
Uh, Jack's upstairs.

14:34.741 --> 14:36.043
Hey, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

14:36.109 --> 14:38.111
Make sure
you got your inhaler.

14:38.178 --> 14:39.312
Okay.

14:39.379 --> 14:41.414
Donna and I would love
to get a -- a hot tub,

14:41.481 --> 14:43.883
but we probably couldn't
afford one right now.

14:43.951 --> 14:46.253
$30 a month.
Got it.

14:46.319 --> 14:48.588
Okay.
Hold on a second, Grayden.

14:48.655 --> 14:50.857
30 -- 30 bucks
a month?

14:50.924 --> 14:53.093
With zero financing
and my employee discount,

14:53.160 --> 14:54.261
that's what
you're looking at.

14:54.327 --> 14:56.296
Maybe less.
Who knows?

14:56.363 --> 14:57.597
Swing by the showroom.

14:57.664 --> 14:59.299
I'll get you a deal
if you want.

14:59.366 --> 15:00.934
Later, G-man.

15:01.001 --> 15:02.435
( Door closes )

15:02.502 --> 15:05.405
Hey, uh, hang on a second,
G-man.

15:05.472 --> 15:07.640
Do me a favor
and just give this to Jack
and tell him I found it.

15:07.707 --> 15:09.576
It was under the couch.

15:14.514 --> 15:16.183
What's up?
Abort mission, okay?

15:16.249 --> 15:17.817
Jack needs to stay friends
with Grayden.

15:17.884 --> 15:20.753
So forget the Becksford kid.
He's useless to us.

15:20.820 --> 15:22.422
Hey, guess what.

15:22.489 --> 15:25.558
Already picked him up,
and you're on speaker.

15:27.027 --> 15:28.761
Hey!
Robbie B.!

15:30.897 --> 15:33.100
How's it going, big guy?

15:33.166 --> 15:34.534
What's going on?

15:34.601 --> 15:36.503
What's the one thing you want
more than anything else?

15:36.569 --> 15:39.372
To get your cholesterol
under 300.

15:40.573 --> 15:42.742
( Chuckling )
Okay, okay.

15:42.809 --> 15:44.044
No, it's hot tubs,
remember?

15:44.111 --> 15:46.246
You want a hot tub, right?
Well, guess what.

15:46.313 --> 15:48.148
Vic sells them, and he could
get us a sick deal.

15:48.215 --> 15:50.150
No! Honey, I've had it
with these people.

15:50.217 --> 15:51.951
I can't take any more.

15:53.786 --> 15:55.355
How sick a deal is this?

15:55.422 --> 15:56.723
Well, how sick is this?

15:56.789 --> 15:58.858
With his discount,
we'll be sitting in bubbles

15:58.925 --> 16:01.594
for 30 bucks a month!

16:04.831 --> 16:06.133
Listen, honey,
you're a real good kid

16:06.199 --> 16:07.967
and none of this
is your fault,

16:08.035 --> 16:10.070
but I'm gonna need you
to hold on real tight.

16:10.137 --> 16:11.871
( Tires screech )

16:13.640 --> 16:15.475
Can Grayden and I get some
candy from the machine?

16:15.542 --> 16:18.145
Yeah, yeah. You guys, uh,
you doing okay?

16:18.211 --> 16:20.547
Yeah. Can you believe he wants
to be a meteorologist, too?

16:20.613 --> 16:21.648
How cool is that?

16:21.714 --> 16:22.749
Whoa!

16:22.815 --> 16:23.916
Hurricane Best Buddies

16:23.983 --> 16:26.219
is whipping
through Massapequa.

16:28.088 --> 16:29.522
Thank God
we took the high road.

16:29.589 --> 16:33.126
And now we are rewarded
with 25 jets on our lumbars.

16:33.193 --> 16:34.327
I need that.
Mm-hmm.

16:34.394 --> 16:35.862
( Indistinct conversation )

16:39.366 --> 16:41.268
Come on, Leo!
Please, Leo!

16:41.334 --> 16:42.369
Oh!
Hey!

16:42.435 --> 16:43.470
Oh!
Hey!

16:43.536 --> 16:44.604
Hi.
Let's go.

16:44.671 --> 16:45.705
Let's get
this thing done.

16:45.772 --> 16:47.174
Let's do it!
Yeah!

16:47.240 --> 16:48.308
Sit down.

16:48.375 --> 16:49.476
Hey, that one
out in the showroom,

16:49.542 --> 16:51.511
is that the, uh,
30-bucks-a-month one?

16:51.578 --> 16:54.247
The CL-10 Hydra.
Yeah.

16:54.314 --> 16:55.948
Great starter unit.
That's the one we want.

16:56.015 --> 16:58.185
Donna: Yeah.
Yeah, well, that's our
most popular model,

16:58.251 --> 17:00.087
so obviously
it's sold out.

17:00.153 --> 17:01.754
Oh.
Okay.

17:01.821 --> 17:02.822
Yeah, but you don't want it.
You don't want it.

17:02.889 --> 17:04.091
It's a maintenance
nightmare.

17:04.157 --> 17:06.093
Okay, uh, what's the --
What's the next one up?

17:06.159 --> 17:08.795
Yeah, the next one is the
D10-12, another beautiful one.

17:08.861 --> 17:10.230
That's the one I got,
yeah.

17:10.297 --> 17:12.665
Also sold out.

17:12.732 --> 17:15.001
Okay, well, stop telling
us about the ones
that you don't have

17:15.068 --> 17:17.304
and maybe tell us
about the ones we can buy.

17:17.370 --> 17:18.638
Yes, sir.
Here's the thing.

17:18.705 --> 17:20.773
The only 2016
that we got available

17:20.840 --> 17:23.476
is the XO
Jet Pulse 7000.

17:23.543 --> 17:26.579
It's got the most powerful
jets in the business.
Whoo!

17:26.646 --> 17:28.448
All the bells
and whistles.
Ooh, all right.

17:28.515 --> 17:29.982
And then with
your employee discount,

17:30.049 --> 17:31.351
what's that
gonna cost us?
Yeah.

17:31.418 --> 17:35.788
Uh, the thing
about the employee discount...

17:35.855 --> 17:40.360
I know I said it, I said it,
but it turns out Crazy Leo,

17:40.427 --> 17:42.762
he's not that crazy.

17:42.829 --> 17:44.564
So -- But it's okay.
It's okay.

17:44.631 --> 17:45.798
I'm gonna do something
good for you.

17:45.865 --> 17:47.667
Don't worry about it.
Okay.

17:47.734 --> 17:48.901
Dika, dika, dika, do.

17:48.968 --> 17:51.904
Okay, here you go.
That's your monthly.

17:51.971 --> 17:53.706
Uh.
Whoa. No, no, no.

17:53.773 --> 17:55.208
You said you were
gonna give us a great deal

17:55.275 --> 17:57.810
and you're sticking it
to us.

18:00.480 --> 18:01.548
Okay, look, look.

18:01.614 --> 18:04.784
The truth is...
I'm drowning here, okay?

18:04.851 --> 18:07.454
I got -- I got a house
I can't afford.

18:07.520 --> 18:10.557
I haven't sold a hot tub
in two months.

18:10.623 --> 18:12.625
Leo's got my head
on the chopping block.

18:12.692 --> 18:14.361
I'm gonna have to move back
to Florida.

18:16.829 --> 18:17.897
Who am I kidding?

18:17.964 --> 18:21.100
Selling hot tubs,
it's, uh...

18:21.168 --> 18:22.302
it's a young man's game.

18:22.369 --> 18:24.003
That's what it is.

18:35.848 --> 18:39.452
Vic, we're -- we're real sorry
about all of that,

18:39.519 --> 18:42.822
but, uh,
we still...can't do this.

18:42.889 --> 18:44.657
Yeah.
I get it, I get it,
I get it, yeah.

18:44.724 --> 18:47.960
It's not, uh...

18:48.027 --> 18:51.298
It's not your problem.
I'm, uh -- I'm gonna be fine.

18:51.364 --> 18:53.600
I'll tell you who
I do worry about, though.

18:53.666 --> 18:55.668
Those two little guys
right out there.

18:56.536 --> 18:58.838
( Both laugh )

18:58.905 --> 19:01.808
Look, if I don't turn things
around pretty fast,

19:01.874 --> 19:04.577
they're gonna lose the best
friends they ever had.

19:06.446 --> 19:08.381
Did he just go there?

19:08.448 --> 19:09.616
He went there.
I went there.

19:09.682 --> 19:11.418
I went there.

19:11.484 --> 19:12.919
Well, it's not
gonna work, Vic.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.020
Yeah.
I'm sorry.

19:14.086 --> 19:15.488
You got a --
a lot of problems,

19:15.555 --> 19:16.689
but they're not ours,
all right?

19:16.756 --> 19:18.858
So, have a great life.

19:22.161 --> 19:24.130
Grayden and I are gonna be
partners in the science fair.

19:24.197 --> 19:26.233
We're gonna build
a weather station.

19:29.369 --> 19:32.239
We do want a hot tub.

19:32.305 --> 19:33.540
( Sighs )

19:33.606 --> 19:36.276
All right, look,
I could work one day a month

19:36.343 --> 19:39.446
and...cover it, I guess.

19:39.512 --> 19:41.180
All right,
let's just...

19:44.717 --> 19:46.286
Okay.

19:46.353 --> 19:47.587
We're gonna take
the tub.

19:48.955 --> 19:50.490
Ha!

19:52.359 --> 19:53.926
But here's the deal,
okay?

19:53.993 --> 19:56.195
First off,
that comes back down

19:56.263 --> 19:57.830
because we've already seen
behind the curtain, okay?

19:57.897 --> 19:59.966
Donna: Yeah. It looks like
a ferret's ass.

20:00.032 --> 20:04.604
Second, the kids stay friends,
we don't, okay?

20:04.671 --> 20:06.873
So, when you drop Grayden off,
you stay at the curb.

20:06.939 --> 20:09.442
Yeah.
Done deal.
Okay.

20:09.509 --> 20:10.910
I just got to ask you --

20:10.977 --> 20:14.046
Could I interest you
in the extended warranty?

20:14.113 --> 20:16.349
( As Vic ) No!

20:21.521 --> 20:24.724
Sweetheart,
what is that?

20:24.791 --> 20:27.927
Uh, I believe
that is our new hot tub.

20:30.263 --> 20:32.064
Hey, it's pretty sweet,
huh, hon?

20:32.131 --> 20:34.267
I don't know that
we needed one this big.

20:34.334 --> 20:36.836
He said if I hit one
of these buttons,

20:36.903 --> 20:38.838
it'll turn
the water purple.

20:38.905 --> 20:41.341
( Motor whirring )

20:41.408 --> 20:44.711
( Both grunting )

20:44.777 --> 20:46.112
Hit the button!
Hit the button!

20:46.178 --> 20:47.213
I can't get to it!

20:47.280 --> 20:48.348
Hit the button!
Hit the button!

20:49.516 --> 20:50.683
Oh, my God. No.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.619
( Both grunting )

20:52.685 --> 20:55.522
I got it! I got it! I got it!
I got it! I don't got it!

20:55.588 --> 20:58.891
* Don't want
no sweet perfume *

20:58.958 --> 21:02.495
* Shake your thing,
go bust your move *

21:02.562 --> 21:04.697
* Do, do, do, do, do

21:04.764 --> 21:06.232
* Do, do, do, do

21:06.299 --> 21:09.836
* Ohhhhhh, yeah

21:09.902 --> 21:12.905
* Don't want
no high-heel shoes *

21:12.972 --> 21:15.542
* I just don't want no...
