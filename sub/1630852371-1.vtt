[narrator] <i>In the spring of 1940,</i>

01:08.485 --> 01:10.904
<i>Britain faced a military disaster.</i>

01:12.864 --> 01:14.741
<i>Trapped on the beaches of Dunkirk,</i>

01:14.824 --> 01:16.868
<i>the British Expeditionary Force</i>

01:16.951 --> 01:19.079
<i>faced an impossible situation</i>

01:19.162 --> 01:21.206
<i>as Hitler's army closed in.</i>

01:21.831 --> 01:25.084
[veteran 1] We went through hell.
The guts, the bleeding

01:25.168 --> 01:26.878
and the men being blown to pieces

01:26.961 --> 01:29.547
and the machine gunners
shooting them down by the hundreds.

01:29.631 --> 01:32.217
It was absolutely dreadful.

01:32.300 --> 01:35.053
[veteran 2] These Stukas
were fitted with sirens

01:35.136 --> 01:38.890
and they screamed as they came down
to frighten you,

01:38.973 --> 01:40.433
and they did.

01:40.517 --> 01:42.852
[veteran 3] We were dive-bombed
all day long.

01:42.936 --> 01:47.023
Dead bodies, and you just prayed
you were in the right queue.

01:47.106 --> 01:51.528
[veteran 4] One of my friends
got hit in the head by shrapnel.

01:51.611 --> 01:55.073
Both of his eyes were blown
clean out of his head.

01:55.156 --> 01:58.827
He died almost instantly,
which was a good thing.

01:58.910 --> 02:01.996
[E. Barry] They came diving down on us.
The soldiers said,

02:02.080 --> 02:04.457
"What the devil
are you doing here, missus?"

02:04.541 --> 02:07.418
They piggybacked me along the beach.

02:08.169 --> 02:10.338
It looked as though,
potentially, for Britain,

02:10.421 --> 02:13.508
the war was over
before it had even begun.

02:13.591 --> 02:15.051
[mellow music]

02:15.135 --> 02:18.596
[narrator] <i>The core of the British Army</i>
<i>was on the brink of being eliminated.</i>

02:18.680 --> 02:21.099
<i>There seemed no escape.</i>

02:22.308 --> 02:24.561
[H. Garrett]
<i>We were on the beach for 48 hours,</i>

02:24.644 --> 02:26.437
<i>no food, no water,</i>

02:26.521 --> 02:29.023
<i>nowhere to go, nowhere to hide.</i>

02:29.107 --> 02:32.026
<i>You just hoped that they would miss you.</i>

02:32.110 --> 02:33.194
[bombs crashing]

02:33.278 --> 02:36.906
[narrator] <i>Operation Dynamo</i>
<i>was the climactic moment</i>

02:36.990 --> 02:39.534
<i>of one of the greatest escapes</i>
<i>of all time.</i>

02:40.451 --> 02:42.537
<i>Hundreds of British ship crews,</i>

02:42.620 --> 02:45.123
<i>many in private boats,</i>
<i>crossed the Channel,</i>

02:45.832 --> 02:48.877
<i>bravely plunging</i>
<i>into the thick of battle.</i>

02:48.960 --> 02:51.462
[J. Haward] The water was up to my chest.

02:51.546 --> 02:53.131
Over came the Luftwaffe,

02:53.214 --> 02:55.800
so we were like sitting ducks
in the water.

02:56.843 --> 03:00.305
[E. Oates] My overcoat was permanently
wet from the waist down.

03:00.930 --> 03:02.348
[H. Garrett] I could hardly swim,

03:02.432 --> 03:07.020
but it's surprising,
when you've got to, you do it.

03:07.103 --> 03:09.522
This hospital ship got blown.

03:09.606 --> 03:13.776
This bomb went right down the funnel
and it blew to smithereens

03:13.860 --> 03:16.988
and there were dead and dying boys
all over in the water

03:17.071 --> 03:19.949
and the captain said,
"We cannot stop, gentlemen.

03:20.033 --> 03:21.242
We cannot stop."

03:23.202 --> 03:25.914
And then suddenly
we got into the Channel…

03:26.831 --> 03:30.418
and there was relief, relief, relief.

03:30.501 --> 03:34.339
We got to Dover
and then we kissed the ground…

03:35.173 --> 03:36.883
and cried our eyes out.

03:36.966 --> 03:37.842
[laughing emotionally]

03:37.926 --> 03:39.677
[powerful music]

03:39.761 --> 03:41.179
[bells chiming]

03:41.262 --> 03:44.015
[narrator] <i>In celebration</i>
<i>of the courage of the soldiers</i>

03:44.098 --> 03:46.309
<i>and those who saved them,</i>

03:46.392 --> 03:49.229
<i>this is the story of an epic escape</i>

03:49.312 --> 03:51.648

03:51.731 --> 03:55.193
<i>told by those who were actually there.</i>

03:55.276 --> 03:57.028
[H. Garrett] I have been to hell.

03:57.111 --> 04:00.406
I think and dream of it
every night, every day,

04:00.490 --> 04:05.954
of the days when I went through
so much to live,

04:06.037 --> 04:11.251
and now, 99.4, he's still here.

04:12.502 --> 04:14.212
Every morning,

04:14.295 --> 04:16.506
wake up, and there it is.

04:16.589 --> 04:19.133
I'm amazed I'm still alive.

04:19.217 --> 04:21.844
I can dream every night about it.

04:22.470 --> 04:26.057
[J. Haward] I'm the only known
living survivor of my battalion.

04:26.140 --> 04:29.894
I mean, I was only one
of a million, wasn't I?

04:29.978 --> 04:31.854
[H. Garrett] They're so forgetful today.

04:31.938 --> 04:35.817
I talked to some people,
they said, "What war was that?"

04:35.900 --> 04:39.112
You know, that's the attitude of today.

04:39.737 --> 04:43.491
I mean, I go to the schools,
the kids have never heard of Dunkirk.

04:43.574 --> 04:45.118
Nor have the teachers.

04:45.785 --> 04:47.662
[J. Levine] Dunkirk is so important

04:47.745 --> 04:51.582
in a global, military, political sense

04:51.666 --> 04:55.795
that it's amazing to me
that people don't remember it.

04:55.878 --> 04:57.588
Certainly until the film came along,

04:57.672 --> 05:00.008
people had no idea at all
what Dunkirk was.

05:00.091 --> 05:03.845
And even those who knew thought about it
as, you know, that little British bit

05:03.928 --> 05:06.723
that happened before America
got involved and saved the day.

05:06.806 --> 05:09.350
It's a hell of a lot
more important than that.

05:09.434 --> 05:12.645
It's a universal story of survival.

05:13.229 --> 05:16.024
It was a miracle in the sense
that so many troops got home

05:16.107 --> 05:17.358
when, you know, on the face of it,

05:17.442 --> 05:19.861
it didn't seem likely
that very many would at all.

05:19.944 --> 05:22.613
The fact that the British got home,

05:22.697 --> 05:26.617
meant that Britain didn't have to make
a peace treaty with Hitler.

05:26.701 --> 05:28.703
Britain didn't have to surrender.

05:28.786 --> 05:30.580
If the troops had been destroyed,

05:30.663 --> 05:32.206
the war would have been over

05:32.290 --> 05:36.335
and the consequences, well,
would still be with us today.

05:38.671 --> 05:42.175
[woman] There is no glory in war.

05:43.593 --> 05:45.511
It is just survival.

05:46.345 --> 05:48.598
[mellow music]

05:51.225 --> 05:53.770
[H. Garrett] I was born in 1918.

05:53.853 --> 05:55.563
A pretty poor family.

05:55.646 --> 05:58.316
My mother was a lovely lady

05:58.399 --> 06:00.109
and they couldn't control me,

06:00.193 --> 06:04.530
so they said, "He will go
to Dr. Barnardo’s homes."

06:04.614 --> 06:07.909
So I went when I was five
till I was eight,

06:07.992 --> 06:10.661
and then from there
I went to Norwood Children's Homes

06:10.745 --> 06:13.164
for two years,
and I went to Sidcup Homes

06:13.247 --> 06:15.750
and that was my early years.

06:16.250 --> 06:21.047
And believe you me,
you can't understand life in those days.

06:21.130 --> 06:23.800
It was pretty, pretty rough,
pretty rough.

06:24.550 --> 06:28.805
[J. Haward] I joined
the Territorial Army at the age of 18.

06:29.388 --> 06:32.892
Well, I joined it because
of the cheap beer and the canteen

06:32.975 --> 06:35.186
and the girls liked men in uniform.

06:36.145 --> 06:39.065
I didn't really join it
to become a soldier. [chuckles]

06:39.148 --> 06:42.235
[H. Garrett] We joined
the Territorial Army at Brixton.

06:42.318 --> 06:44.570
I was in front of the infantry.

06:44.654 --> 06:48.866
My job as an anti-tank gunner
was to shoot the tanks.

06:48.950 --> 06:53.329
[A. Taylor] We were cycling along
with my friend in Wimbledon Common

06:53.412 --> 06:58.501
and recruiting sergeants stopped us:
"Would you like to join the army?"

06:58.584 --> 06:59.544
We said yes.

06:59.627 --> 07:02.672
He said, "How old are you?"

07:02.755 --> 07:04.507
And I told him 16.

07:04.590 --> 07:06.551
"Oh," he says, "You're not old enough."

07:06.634 --> 07:09.262
I said, "Hang on a minute. No, I'm 17."

07:09.345 --> 07:11.305
So he signed me on.

07:11.389 --> 07:12.932
[mellow music]

07:20.690 --> 07:22.066
[H. Garrett] <i>A kid that age,</i>

07:22.150 --> 07:25.403

<i>the uniform.</i>

07:28.281 --> 07:31.117
[adventurous music]

07:31.200 --> 07:34.454
[W. Churchill] We tried again and again
to prevent this war

07:34.537 --> 07:36.205
but now we are at war…

07:37.248 --> 07:38.916
and we are going to make war…

07:40.168 --> 07:42.462
and persevere in making war…

07:43.171 --> 07:45.798
until the other side
have had enough of it.

07:45.882 --> 07:48.009
[sombre music]

07:48.968 --> 07:51.721
[E. Barry] I was born in Belgium, Antwerp.

07:51.804 --> 07:54.515
Then the war came,
of course we had to get out.

07:54.599 --> 07:57.477
The Germans smashed
our house to bits

07:57.560 --> 08:00.771
and, of course, we had
to leave everything behind.

08:01.397 --> 08:02.857
I was only nine.

08:02.940 --> 08:07.653
[A. Smith] War was declared
September 3, 1939.

08:07.737 --> 08:11.491
In the end of September, I was called up,

08:11.574 --> 08:13.034
so I was in pretty quick.

08:13.117 --> 08:14.911
I was conscripted.

08:14.994 --> 08:18.789
[A. Taylor] I saw a war was coming
and my father advised me

08:18.873 --> 08:22.251
to get out of the army
and join the air force.

08:22.335 --> 08:25.004
We had a medical for aircrew.

08:25.087 --> 08:28.925
I was wearing glasses,
I failed the medical,

08:29.008 --> 08:30.676
and saved my life

08:30.760 --> 08:36.098
because the majority of my class
didn't live out the war…

08:37.016 --> 08:39.477
so having glasses saved my life.

08:40.228 --> 08:41.646
[soldiers chanting]

08:41.729 --> 08:44.607
[A. Smith] You looked upon it
as an adventure at first.

08:44.690 --> 08:46.817
We never realized, you know,

08:47.693 --> 08:49.278
what it was gonna be.

08:49.362 --> 08:53.616
[E. Oates]

08:53.699 --> 08:57.495
Well, nobody could really, really
know, like, what would happen.

09:18.641 --> 09:23.187

[J. Levine] <i>The very beginning</i>

10:00.808 --> 10:02.435
<i>Not much was happening,</i>

[A. Smith] We sailed across
on Christmas Day,

10:47.271 --> 10:51.192
landed in Cherbourg
in France on Boxing Day,

10:51.275 --> 10:53.027
so that was our Christmas.

10:54.320 --> 10:55.863
[glasses clinking]

10:57.281 --> 11:00.076
[J. Haward] We went to a place
called Gondecourt

11:00.159 --> 11:02.036
up near the Belgian border,

11:02.119 --> 11:04.288
and I was in a machine gun battalion.

11:04.372 --> 11:07.291
A lot different than being at home
with your mum, you know?

11:07.375 --> 11:08.626
[laughs]

11:08.709 --> 11:11.087
[A. Smith] As I was able to drive,

11:11.170 --> 11:15.341
I was put into the Royal Army
Service Corps, which is all transport.

11:15.424 --> 11:17.134
[adventurous music]

11:17.218 --> 11:19.512
That winter of 1939

11:19.595 --> 11:22.932
was a very severe winter, deep snow.

11:23.015 --> 11:27.436
We were so short of supplies
and that was the trouble.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.313
You were sleeping in haylofts

11:29.397 --> 11:32.358
and you were given one blanket
between two

11:32.441 --> 11:34.110
and it was freezing.

11:34.193 --> 11:38.614
In fact, my pal and I got up one night
and had a jog in the snow.

11:38.697 --> 11:41.909
We'd run as fast as we could
to try and get warm.

11:41.992 --> 11:43.911
We were that frozen.

11:47.581 --> 11:50.209
[narrator] <i>Soldiers were issued</i>
<i>with food rations</i>

11:53.963 --> 11:56.006
[A. Smith] <i>You were given</i>

12:02.721 --> 12:06.392
[J. Haward] <i>These army biscuits,</i>

12:06.475 --> 12:09.979
<i>You had to break them with something</i>
<i>and make them soft and swallow them,</i>

12:10.062 --> 12:14.358
<i>so I said, "Yes, I'll have another one,"</i>
<i>and I nearly broke my teeth biting it.</i>

12:14.442 --> 12:16.193
They were so hard.

12:17.486 --> 12:20.531
They say the biscuits have got
a lot of energy in them,

12:20.614 --> 12:22.825
so I'll take their word for that. [laughs]

12:22.908 --> 12:26.579
[J. Haward] Sometimes the cook
gave us what he called stew,

12:26.662 --> 12:29.290

12:42.094 --> 12:44.763
<i>But with scandalously</i>
<i>inadequate training,</i>

12:44.847 --> 12:48.434
<i>they were ill-equipped to fight</i>
<i>a superior German Army.</i>

12:48.517 --> 12:50.186
[J. Levine]
<i>A lot of the troops weren't trained</i>

12:50.269 --> 12:52.188
<i>because they weren't really soldiers.</i>

12:52.271 --> 12:54.940
For virtually all of them
it was the first time they'd seen action.

12:55.024 --> 12:57.818
[J. Levine] <i>It's an amazing fact, a lot</i>
<i>of these people had never fired a gun.</i>

12:57.902 --> 12:59.695
<i>Literally never fired a gun.</i>

12:59.778 --> 13:01.614
[J. Haward] By the time we went to France,

13:01.697 --> 13:05.868
we just about knew which end
of the machine gun the bullet came out of.

13:05.951 --> 13:07.620
[A. Smith] <i>All we did was march about.</i>

13:07.703 --> 13:10.122
[A. Smith] <i>You're given</i>
<i>a bit of basic drill,</i>

13:10.206 --> 13:12.708
<i>given a rifle,</i>
<i>a little bit of target practice,</i>

13:12.791 --> 13:15.169
<i>and then I was allocated a lorry</i>

13:15.252 --> 13:17.838
<i>and that lorry you kept all the time.</i>

13:18.672 --> 13:22.927
[B. Coot]

13:30.267 --> 13:33.229
Well, James seems to be having
a pretty exciting time at sea.

13:33.312 --> 13:35.731
There's no doubt
he's doing his bit all right.

13:35.814 --> 13:37.900
Here we are at home, nice and comfortable,

13:37.983 --> 13:39.568
sitting around the fireside.

13:39.652 --> 13:42.863
Do you know, it makes me feel
I'm not pulling my weight in this war.

13:42.947 --> 13:44.698
[in German] Heil Hitler!

13:44.782 --> 13:47.326
[Hitler giving a speech]

13:47.409 --> 13:49.411
[narrator] <i>By May 1940,</i>

13:49.495 --> 13:51.372
<i>things looked bleak in Europe…</i>

13:52.414 --> 13:55.334
<i>as Hitler's army</i>
<i>unleashed devastating attacks</i>

13:55.417 --> 13:58.629
<i>on France, Belgium, and the Netherlands.</i>

13:58.712 --> 14:00.256
[bombs crashing]

14:02.299 --> 14:05.052
[J. Levine] <i>In May,</i>
<i>the action really began.</i>

14:05.135 --> 14:06.470
<i>The Germans moved forward</i>

14:06.554 --> 14:10.057
<i>and so did the British Expeditionary</i>
<i>Force move forward to meet them</i>

14:10.140 --> 14:12.685
<i>at a pre-arranged point in Belgium.</i>

14:12.768 --> 14:15.187
<i>They hadn't been allowed</i>
<i>into Belgium up to this point.</i>

14:15.271 --> 14:17.940
<i>The idea was Belgium was staying neutral</i>

14:18.023 --> 14:20.192
<i>and would only get involved</i>
<i>if it was attacked.</i>

14:20.276 --> 14:22.069
<i>So once the Germans moved into Belgium,</i>

14:22.152 --> 14:24.613
<i>so the British Expeditionary Force</i>
<i>and the French</i>

14:24.697 --> 14:27.032
<i>moved forward</i>
<i>from their lines in France</i>

14:27.116 --> 14:29.285
<i>forward into Belgium to meet them.</i>

14:31.495 --> 14:34.123
[A. Taylor] First place we went to
was Brussels

14:34.206 --> 14:37.543
and the street we were in was empty.

14:37.626 --> 14:39.628
It had been completely evacuated.

14:39.712 --> 14:41.213
The civilians had just gone.

14:41.297 --> 14:43.257
[adventurous music]

14:46.760 --> 14:50.264
[E. Barry] We got on a train
in Antwerp and it wouldn't move,

14:50.347 --> 14:54.977
so we got off and we walked
from Belgium to France.

14:55.060 --> 14:57.646
We walked all that way.

14:57.730 --> 14:59.815
[adventurous music]

15:00.858 --> 15:04.111
[A. Smith] It was a beautiful day,
lovely, sunny sky,

15:04.194 --> 15:07.323
little white clouds,
and we were in this French village,

15:07.406 --> 15:09.658
and I was walking across the square

15:09.742 --> 15:13.871
and out of a white cloud
came this German fighter

15:13.954 --> 15:15.706
who swooped down a machine gun at me.

15:16.498 --> 15:19.335
But he was a rotten shot. He missed me.

15:19.418 --> 15:21.670
[adventurous music]

15:21.754 --> 15:26.008
[H. Garrett] <i>When Germany</i>
<i>started the Blitzkrieg the 10th of May,</i>

15:26.091 --> 15:28.594
<i>that's when we first met up</i>
<i>with the Germans.</i>

15:28.677 --> 15:31.305
[A. Taylor] We went all the way
along the River Dyle

15:31.388 --> 15:33.933
and the Germans were on the other side

15:34.016 --> 15:36.143
firing at our guns

15:36.226 --> 15:38.646
and we were firing at their guns.

15:38.729 --> 15:42.942
So we had a Lysander up there
sending the information to me

15:43.025 --> 15:44.985
and I informed the army,

15:45.069 --> 15:49.406
so I eventually got their target
and shot the aircraft down.

15:50.532 --> 15:53.410
[J. Levine] What was expected really
was a stand-off

15:53.494 --> 15:56.288
like the First World War,
a war of attrition,

15:56.372 --> 15:58.082
a war of very little movement.

15:58.165 --> 16:01.585
People thought they would be
ending up in their own trenches

16:01.669 --> 16:04.421
facing Germany in their trenches.

16:04.505 --> 16:07.383
Because that's what they were used to.
But that's not what happened.

16:07.466 --> 16:11.512
Because the Germans mounted
this incredibly audacious attack

16:12.096 --> 16:15.099
through the Ardennes,
using their Panzer tanks,

16:15.182 --> 16:18.394
and it just cut through the defences.

16:18.477 --> 16:21.855
People didn't think they could get
through a forested area with the tanks,

16:21.939 --> 16:23.148
but the fact was they did.

16:23.232 --> 16:27.528
And virtually no defence was behind them,
so they just streaked through

16:27.611 --> 16:30.990
and in a matter of days,
they had reached the coast.

16:31.073 --> 16:33.951
[ominous music]

16:35.035 --> 16:39.206
[J. Haward] We found ourselves
at a town called Veurne.

16:39.289 --> 16:42.918
These Stukas would circle up
and then pick their target

16:43.002 --> 16:46.046
and the leading one
would be diving down.

16:46.130 --> 16:49.216
Well, we discovered that if you fired,

16:49.299 --> 16:52.553
those who were circling
could see the flash of the guns

16:52.636 --> 16:55.222
and they would probably bomb you,

16:55.305 --> 16:59.601
so in the end we used to wait
until the last one was in his dive,

16:59.685 --> 17:02.730
they used to come almost vertically,
and he couldn't alter it,

17:02.813 --> 17:04.606
and that's the one we used to shoot at.

17:04.690 --> 17:08.193
Shot one down, anyway,
that was quite satisfactory.

17:08.777 --> 17:11.905
[H. Garrett] I heard that the Germans
were four miles away

17:11.989 --> 17:14.742
and I suddenly saw a roadblock,

17:14.825 --> 17:17.453
soldiers coming through.
It was the Guard's Brigade.

17:17.536 --> 17:18.954
I said, "What are you buggers doing?

17:19.038 --> 17:21.665
He said, "We've been told
to retire to Lille."

17:21.749 --> 17:23.751
I said, "Well, I've just left there."

17:23.834 --> 17:27.129
And he said, "Well, you'd better
hang about, see what's going on."

17:27.212 --> 17:31.300
So my officer, he went and found out
that we've got to move too.

17:32.301 --> 17:34.845
So from there we went to Arras, Amiens

17:34.928 --> 17:37.139
and fought the Germans down there.

17:38.474 --> 17:42.478
[narrator] <i>The Allied armies were</i>
<i>hampered by poor communications.</i>

17:42.561 --> 17:45.898
<i>With no common leader,</i>
<i>they often operated solely</i>

17:45.981 --> 17:48.108
<i>with their own objectives in mind.</i>

17:49.401 --> 17:51.820
We didn't know where we were going
or what we were doing.

17:51.904 --> 17:56.617
[J. Levine] <i>The lack of communication</i>
<i>between the British and the French</i>

17:56.700 --> 17:58.535
<i>in the build-up to Dunkirk,</i>

17:59.244 --> 18:01.538
<i>neither side really knew</i>
<i>what the other was doing.</i>

18:02.873 --> 18:07.419
[H. Garrett] Sergeant Grover said, "Harry,
you put on that spot there with your gun,

18:07.503 --> 18:12.174
and if any tanks come in to you with their
guns pointing forward, they're enemy.

18:12.257 --> 18:15.177
If the guns are reversed,
they're friendly."

18:15.260 --> 18:17.137
So I said, "Okay, Sarge."

18:17.221 --> 18:21.100
So I sat there with my gun and I said,
"There's tanks coming, Sarge."

18:21.183 --> 18:23.685
He said, "Well, shoot the bastards then."

18:23.769 --> 18:25.813
I said, "Well, I can't see them."

18:25.896 --> 18:28.941
"Oh, right, get on."

18:29.024 --> 18:33.570
So I carried on and suddenly
they started firing at us.

18:34.530 --> 18:36.824
Guns were blowing us to pieces.

18:36.907 --> 18:39.827
I thought, "This is terrible,
this is terrible."

18:39.910 --> 18:41.495
And then suddenly my gun was hit

18:41.578 --> 18:43.705
and we were knocked out
for a couple of minutes.

18:43.789 --> 18:44.957
And suddenly…

18:45.040 --> 18:48.085
"Monsieur, oh Monsieur.

18:48.168 --> 18:51.380
We're so sorry,
we thought you were the Germans."

18:52.005 --> 18:55.551
These are bloody Frenchmen in this tank,

18:55.634 --> 18:59.930
as big as a house, but we got
about 17 causalities then.

19:01.723 --> 19:05.102
[J. Levine] The lesson that was learned
was that communication with their allies

19:05.185 --> 19:08.063
would have to be far, far better
in the future and not only that,

19:08.147 --> 19:11.441
the communication amongst themselves
would have to be better.

19:12.860 --> 19:15.654
[narrator] <i>The Allied defenders</i>
<i>were unable to match</i>

19:15.737 --> 19:19.741
<i>the sheer might and ferocity</i>

<i>Faced with superior air power</i>
<i>and a more unified command,</i>

19:24.955 --> 19:27.958
<i>they were a poor match</i>
<i>for the German Wehrmacht.</i>

19:29.168 --> 19:31.128
[J. Delaney] <i>The German Army</i>
<i>was better equipped.</i>

19:31.211 --> 19:34.590
<i>It was most certainly better trained</i>
<i>and more experienced.</i>

19:34.673 --> 19:37.593
[J. Haward] <i>All their armaments</i>
<i>were better than ours.</i>

19:37.676 --> 19:41.346
<i>Their machine guns were better.</i>
<i>Their anti-tank guns were better.</i>

19:41.430 --> 19:42.973
<i>Their tanks were better.</i>

19:43.056 --> 19:45.517
<i>Always one step ahead of what we got.</i>

19:45.601 --> 19:50.981
<i>They always had bigger tanks</i>
<i>that could fire farther distances.</i>

19:51.064 --> 19:54.568
<i>They just stood out of range of ours</i>
<i>and just knocked them out.</i>

19:54.651 --> 19:56.778
We had rifles, but they weren't good.

19:57.905 --> 20:00.782
[J. Haward] My weapon was a Webley 38.

20:00.866 --> 20:03.952
When it was time to fire them,
it was time to get out of it,

20:04.036 --> 20:06.914
because you couldn't hit a barn door
at ten feet with them.

I had some wonderful friends

21:13.689 --> 21:17.609
There was 100 soldiers
put in a barn as prisoners.

21:17.693 --> 21:21.488
So the Nazis came through one evening,

21:22.406 --> 21:27.119
and they machine-gunned and shot
every soldier in there.

21:27.202 --> 21:29.746

21:29.830 --> 21:34.751

were still alive

with all the dead and dying

21:42.009 --> 21:47.014

put them in the grave.

21:49.141 --> 21:51.101
[sombre music]

21:52.644 --> 21:55.647
[J. Haward] I'll tell you one thing,
not all Germans were bad,

21:55.731 --> 21:58.317
although we were trying
to kill each other.

21:58.400 --> 22:00.527
And I don't suppose a lot of them

22:00.610 --> 22:04.114
wanted to be where they were
any more than we did.

22:04.906 --> 22:08.618
[A. Smith] The funny thing is
that I liked the German people.

22:08.702 --> 22:10.620
They're a lovely lot of people.

22:10.704 --> 22:13.415
It was just these Nazi troops.

22:14.124 --> 22:17.669
[H. Garrett] <i>I saw plenty</i>

22:17.753 --> 22:20.339

<i>They would always attend to them</i>

[A. Smith] <i>You know,</i>
<i>the ordinary German person</i>

22:35.437 --> 22:37.022
<i>they didn't want to fight.</i>

22:38.023 --> 22:39.983
[J. Haward]
I always used to say to my men,

22:40.067 --> 22:41.818
if you take any prisoners,

22:41.902 --> 22:45.363
treat them as you would wish
to be treated

22:45.447 --> 22:48.116
if the situation was reversed.

22:48.200 --> 22:52.454
I mean, after all, they were human beings.

[H. Garrett] There had to be dissidents.
I didn't see any cowards.

23:13.934 --> 23:16.436
Well, I only had one, he was a driver.

23:16.520 --> 23:18.730
I'm not gonna tell you what his name was,

23:18.814 --> 23:23.568
but he was a proper ladies' man.
Curly hair with a little moustache

23:23.652 --> 23:26.238
and his side cap on the side of his hat.

23:27.155 --> 23:28.740
And he was a boaster.

23:28.824 --> 23:30.408
We couldn't find this fella.

23:30.492 --> 23:34.246
He went missing and I found him
lying in our slit trench.

23:34.329 --> 23:36.790
I said, "Where have you been?"

23:36.873 --> 23:38.750
He said, "I got lost."

behind someone else?"

23:45.715 --> 23:47.634
But anyway, that was it,

23:47.717 --> 23:51.471
so we used to give him
the least responsible job

23:51.555 --> 23:54.724

wasn't quite fair, you know,

24:05.318 --> 24:07.988
"I don't care what you say or do to me,

24:08.071 --> 24:11.116
I'm not driving
this carrier up that road."

24:11.783 --> 24:15.078
Well, the only thing you could do
was to stop their pay.

24:15.162 --> 24:17.622
Not that we got much anyway.

24:18.331 --> 24:20.959
And I wouldn't have minded
if he wasn't such a boaster.

24:21.042 --> 24:25.213
When he was out,
"Oh, we did this, we did that."

24:25.797 --> 24:30.719
I said, "You did nothing
except crap your pants."

24:32.345 --> 24:35.515
I don't know
whether you call that trauma or what.

24:40.270 --> 24:43.190
[narrator] <i>It would be several years</i>
<i>after the events at Dunkirk</i>

24:43.273 --> 24:44.983

24:45.066 --> 24:47.777

24:47.861 --> 24:49.779
[mellow music]

24:49.863 --> 24:52.866
[E. Barry] Those soldiers
that come back from the front,

24:52.949 --> 24:54.784
I know exactly how they feel.

24:55.493 --> 24:57.787
I used to have a lot of flashbacks

24:57.871 --> 25:00.373
but I never had any treatment or anything.

25:00.457 --> 25:04.586
We never bothered about counselling.
You had to get on with it.

25:04.669 --> 25:06.046
[H. Garrett] I didn't need counselling.

25:06.129 --> 25:11.468
May I say, the men of those days
were a lot different than the men today.

25:11.551 --> 25:14.554
Counselling? Kick up the backside.

25:14.638 --> 25:18.183
Bloody counselling,
it's a load of rubbish.

25:18.266 --> 25:20.852
There wasn't anyone
to give them counselling.

25:20.936 --> 25:22.979
Well, not officially.

25:23.063 --> 25:24.648
[sombre music]

25:24.731 --> 25:27.692

[narrator] <i>Outnumbered,</i>
<i>outgunned and outmanoeuvred,</i>

25:31.696 --> 25:34.866

[J. Delaney] <i>The Blitzkrieg operations</i>

<i>have effectively encircled</i>

25:52.008 --> 25:54.970
[R. Willard-Wright] The speed meant
that they almost got to the point

25:55.053 --> 25:57.722
of cutting off any exit.

25:57.806 --> 26:01.851
[J. Levine] The effect of these tanks
streaking through and reaching the coast,

26:01.935 --> 26:05.188
meant that the British Expeditionary
Force was effectively outflanked.

26:05.272 --> 26:09.442
It meant that even before the fighting
had begun in any real sense,

26:09.526 --> 26:14.072
they already were on the back foot
and they were going to have to retreat.

26:14.155 --> 26:17.242
The British, from purely pragmatic view,

26:17.325 --> 26:19.160
saw that the battle was lost,

26:19.244 --> 26:21.037
they knew it was gonna end badly.

26:21.788 --> 26:25.000
And they thought, "The only way
we can stay in the war,

26:25.083 --> 26:27.919
is to get our men away.
Then we can carry on the fight."

26:28.003 --> 26:29.879
[E. Oates] We knew things were boiling up,

26:33.216 --> 26:35.468
[A. Smith] And the Germans
had circled us around.

26:35.552 --> 26:37.262
It happened so quickly.

26:37.345 --> 26:39.723
The only way out was by water.

26:39.806 --> 26:42.934
[R. Willard-Wright] And by that time,
the word was Dunkirk.

26:43.018 --> 26:45.812
That was the only escape
for the British soldier.

26:46.938 --> 26:49.232
[bombs crashing]

26:53.445 --> 26:57.157
[J. Haward] Along this road,
came this German staff car.

26:57.240 --> 26:59.659
Patrol shot the driver

26:59.743 --> 27:03.163
and the officer in the back
jumped out and ran away.

27:03.872 --> 27:06.249
But he left behind in the car…

27:07.834 --> 27:09.544
his helmet,

27:09.627 --> 27:11.755
his belt with his Luger,

27:12.756 --> 27:14.632
and a briefcase.

27:14.716 --> 27:19.679
That was immediately taken
to the divisional headquarters

27:19.763 --> 27:22.766
and they realized this briefcase

27:22.849 --> 27:28.063
contained the plans for the German corps
that was to attack Dunkirk.

27:28.146 --> 27:30.273
[R. Willard-Wright]
There were two days grace

27:30.357 --> 27:35.612
which allowed the French citizens
to get out of Dunkirk itself

27:35.695 --> 27:37.822
'cause it had been bombed heavily,

27:37.906 --> 27:42.035
and the French soldiers to barricade it
so that they could defend it.

27:42.118 --> 27:44.412
[adventurous music]

27:45.330 --> 27:48.500
[narrator] <i>The situation</i>
<i>was rapidly becoming desperate.</i>

27:48.583 --> 27:51.211
<i>German tanks had reached</i>
<i>the Channel Coast.</i>

27:52.128 --> 27:54.547
<i>The Maginot Line had been outflanked.</i>

27:54.631 --> 27:58.885
<i>With the French and Belgian armies</i>

27:58.968 --> 28:01.971
<i>there was only one option for the BEF.</i>

28:02.055 --> 28:03.932
<i>Withdrawal to Dunkirk.</i>

28:05.850 --> 28:09.521
[A. Smith] I was driving
along this very twisty road

28:09.604 --> 28:14.651
and there was a bridge that had been hit
and the road was completely blocked.

28:14.734 --> 28:16.111
You couldn't get through.

28:16.194 --> 28:18.822
So I stopped
and while I was looking at a map,

28:18.905 --> 28:23.701
I suddenly saw someone coming up
with a revolver in his hand.

28:23.785 --> 28:26.830
So I grabbed my rifle, ready to shoot

28:26.913 --> 28:29.666
and then I realized
it was a British officer.

28:29.749 --> 28:31.876
He said, "Where are you making for?

28:31.960 --> 28:34.754
And I said, "That little village."

28:34.838 --> 28:38.091
He said, "Well good job for you
that the bridge is down,

28:38.174 --> 28:41.302
because the Germans
are in charge of that village."

28:41.386 --> 28:43.763
And he said, "In case you don't know,

28:43.847 --> 28:48.143
you're encircled,
so make for the beach."

28:48.226 --> 28:52.355
So I drove back to where my
company was, but they'd gone.

28:52.439 --> 28:53.523
[laughs]

28:57.026 --> 29:01.322
[J. Haward] Montgomery was able
to shift my division to fill out the gap

29:01.406 --> 29:04.409
where the German Panzers
were gonna come through.

29:04.492 --> 29:10.373
And so we got to the Comines Canal
where we took up position just in time

29:10.457 --> 29:13.042
before the Germans arrived
the other side.

29:13.126 --> 29:16.838
We were there for about five days
holding them back

29:16.921 --> 29:19.883
while the rest
were getting away from Dunkirk.

29:19.966 --> 29:23.470
On the last night,
the Germans got around us,

29:23.553 --> 29:27.098
so we decided someone had to go back
to our headquarters

29:27.182 --> 29:29.225
and tell them what was happening.

29:29.309 --> 29:30.935
So I volunteered.

29:31.019 --> 29:33.104
So I ran up to this farm

29:33.188 --> 29:36.733
and on guard outside
was a friend of mine…

29:37.901 --> 29:40.278
and he shot me…

29:41.446 --> 29:43.656
from a few feet.

29:43.740 --> 29:45.700
But it wasn't serious.

29:45.784 --> 29:47.994
It went through my shoulder,
right shoulder.

29:48.077 --> 29:49.954
He thought I was a German.

29:50.038 --> 29:52.040
And he said, "I'm sorry.

29:52.123 --> 29:54.626
I aimed for your head."

29:54.709 --> 29:56.795
Well, he was only a few feet from me,

29:56.878 --> 30:00.965
and I said, "It's a bloody good job
you're a rotten shot then, isn't it John?"

30:01.049 --> 30:03.426
[sombre music]

30:04.761 --> 30:06.930
[narrator] <i>Defeated and humiliated,</i>

30:07.013 --> 30:09.641
<i>the Allies were backed into a corner.</i>

30:09.724 --> 30:11.768
<i>Surrender seemed inevitable.</i>

30:12.477 --> 30:15.522
<i>The war for Europe was assumed to be won.</i>

30:16.272 --> 30:18.983
This incredible defeat,

30:19.067 --> 30:21.611
because that's what it was,
it was a huge defeat,

30:21.694 --> 30:25.406
looked as though
it would wipe out the British Army.

30:25.490 --> 30:27.909
If the army was outflanked already,

30:27.992 --> 30:30.328
all the Germans had to do
was to curve round

30:30.411 --> 30:32.580
and it would be completely surrounded.

30:32.664 --> 30:34.707
And if it was completely surrounded,
how on earth

30:34.791 --> 30:37.460
could it possibly do anything
but surrender?

30:37.544 --> 30:42.131
[H. Garrett] <i>We heard from the general</i>
<i>that they could not help us.</i>

30:42.215 --> 30:44.050
I knew we'd lost the war.

30:44.133 --> 30:49.305
And you thought, "Well, they're going
to invade Britain now and that's it."

30:49.389 --> 30:53.518
I didn't know how we could
possibly win at that stage.

30:53.601 --> 30:57.438
We'd lost everything.
The whole British Army, all its equipment.

30:59.274 --> 31:01.025
[narrator] <i>Amid the unfolding chaos,</i>

31:01.109 --> 31:03.486
<i>the BEF headed for Dunkirk.</i>

31:04.237 --> 31:05.864
[J. Levine] As the British Army
moved back,

31:05.947 --> 31:08.533
it became fairly clear to Lord Gort,

31:08.616 --> 31:11.578
he was the commander-in-chief
of the British Army,

31:11.661 --> 31:14.163
that if Britain
was going to survive in the war,

31:14.247 --> 31:16.583
there would have to be
some kind of evacuation,

31:16.666 --> 31:21.004
and it became very clear that evacuation
could only take place through Dunkirk.

31:21.087 --> 31:24.674
Because bit by bit all the other ports
came into German hands.

31:24.757 --> 31:28.386
The only one that was still
in Allied hands, was Dunkirk.

31:28.469 --> 31:31.639
Now the British soldiers, they
didn't know why they were retreating.

31:32.432 --> 31:34.851
[E. Oates]

31:43.860 --> 31:45.904
[J. Levine]
<i>They were sent into the retreat,</i>

31:45.987 --> 31:48.615
<i>thinking, "Maybe my unit's</i>
<i>done something wrong</i>

31:48.698 --> 31:50.867
<i>and we're being punished</i>
<i>and we're being sent back."</i>

31:50.950 --> 31:53.077
<i>They didn't realize for a long time</i>

31:53.161 --> 31:55.914
<i>that they had been</i>
<i>completely outflanked themselves.</i>

31:55.997 --> 31:58.082
<i>And so back they came.</i>

31:58.791 --> 32:01.753
[H. Garrett] We got through and I said,
"Aw, come on Ken, jump up."

32:01.836 --> 32:04.839
I'd got a lovely big horse
and I put him on board.

32:04.923 --> 32:06.966
I said, "We are going to ride
to Dunkirk on this."

32:07.050 --> 32:09.802
We started to ride, I said,
"No, we can't do that.

32:09.886 --> 32:12.055
That poor horse is gonna get killed.

32:12.138 --> 32:14.515
Come on, off you get, let's go back."

32:14.599 --> 32:17.393
Then we walked, walked, and that was it.

32:19.479 --> 32:22.857
[J. Haward] We handed over
to French troops

32:22.941 --> 32:25.777
to hold the Germans back
while we got away,

32:25.860 --> 32:29.238
so we drove to the outskirts of De Panne

32:29.322 --> 32:31.658
and we were told there was someone there
that would meet us

32:31.741 --> 32:33.534
and tell us where to go.

32:34.827 --> 32:36.829
Of course when we got there,
there was no one there.

32:37.872 --> 32:39.332
So we walked into the sea.

32:39.415 --> 32:43.044
I remember the water
was about up to my chest.

32:43.878 --> 32:48.007
Over came the Luftwaffe
machine-gunning along the beach.

32:48.091 --> 32:49.842
[bombs crashing]

32:51.135 --> 32:53.638
There were no ships,
no boats at all there.

32:53.721 --> 32:56.432
So they took us out of the water

32:56.516 --> 32:59.519
and decided that each machine gun crew

32:59.602 --> 33:01.479
would find their own way.

33:02.939 --> 33:04.857
[A. Taylor] We came across a farm

33:04.941 --> 33:08.111
and the farmer came out
and said, "Are you staying?"

33:08.194 --> 33:10.947
And we said,
"Well, we're moving slowly."

33:11.030 --> 33:14.742
And he said,
"Well, here's the key of my house."

33:14.826 --> 33:18.037
He said, "Look after it as long as you can

33:18.121 --> 33:21.791
because I'm going
and leaving everything behind."

33:21.874 --> 33:24.919
And then the signal
came through, evacuate,

33:25.003 --> 33:29.048
so we evacuated
and that was the end of that.

33:32.260 --> 33:34.095
[E. Barry] We were
three weeks on the road.

33:34.178 --> 33:36.889
We were in the farmyard
with all the animals.

33:36.973 --> 33:38.599
We could help ourselves,

33:38.683 --> 33:42.520
went into the nest boxes,
but we couldn't drink the water,

33:42.603 --> 33:45.398
we couldn't drink nothing,
we couldn't have nothing to drink.

33:46.315 --> 33:49.444
[H. Garrett] Hadn't got any food,
no water, nothing.

33:49.527 --> 33:52.739
And I said, "Oh, Ebbie,
what are we gonna do?"

33:52.822 --> 33:55.950
He said, "Harry,
there's an old bullock there.

33:56.034 --> 33:58.703
We're gonna shoot him up."

33:58.786 --> 34:00.663
He's going… [moans]

34:01.789 --> 34:05.126
I could hear him moaning, poor old thing.

34:05.418 --> 34:09.589
So we shot him and he cut some joints
of beef off him

34:09.672 --> 34:14.177
and we had steak that thick, my God.

34:15.762 --> 34:18.639
[E. Barry] We did eventually
meet the soldiers.

34:18.723 --> 34:20.475
We were with the Cheshire regiment.

34:20.558 --> 34:22.560
They were very good, they fed us.

34:22.643 --> 34:26.481
We had a lot of biscuits,
hard crust things.

34:26.564 --> 34:28.399
Horrible. [laughs]

34:31.069 --> 34:33.029
[narrator] <i>With the enemy on their heels,</i>

34:33.112 --> 34:35.698
<i>the retreating army</i>
<i>continued to the coast.</i>

34:36.908 --> 34:40.661
[A. Smith] We were told
that if you found a forces shop,

34:40.745 --> 34:42.789
just go in and help yourself,

34:42.872 --> 34:45.583
because the Germans will have everything.

34:45.666 --> 34:49.003
So I went in there
and I got some cigarettes

34:49.087 --> 34:52.507
and my co-driver
who had never driven the lorry,

34:53.299 --> 34:55.051
he got some whiskey.

34:55.134 --> 34:57.011
He was a Scotsman.

34:57.095 --> 34:59.514
He was in the back of the lorry, drunk,

34:59.597 --> 35:02.600
and that was the last I saw of him
until I got to the beach.

[J. Levine] There were so many refugees
on the road

35:53.067 --> 35:54.610
and they just wanted
to get out of the way.

35:54.694 --> 35:57.905
So this really hampered
the British retreat

35:57.989 --> 36:00.825

hundreds of thousands,
millions, of civilians

What is going to happen? Nobody knew.

36:13.546 --> 36:15.464
[E. Barry] We had to keep going,

36:15.548 --> 36:18.759
but the French did suffer.

36:18.843 --> 36:23.014
Oh, we saw
some terrible things there, terrible.

36:23.639 --> 36:27.727
The dead bodies on the side,
it was terrible.

36:27.810 --> 36:30.897
[sombre music]

36:32.315 --> 36:34.442
[H. Garrett]
The terrible sights we used to see

36:34.525 --> 36:38.863
of hundreds of people being murdered
and bombed and blown up.

36:38.946 --> 36:40.698
[sombre music]

36:41.824 --> 36:47.580
[J. Haward] <i>All these refugees with prams</i>
<i>and horses and carts,</i>

36:47.663 --> 36:50.291
<i>and, of course, the Luftwaffe,</i>
<i>they were machine-gunning</i>

36:50.374 --> 36:53.252
<i>to cause chaos and block the roads.</i>

36:53.336 --> 36:54.921
They'd just bomb anything.

36:55.004 --> 36:56.756
[H. Garrett] They didn't care.

36:56.839 --> 37:00.676
We went through so much death,
rotten bodies,

37:00.760 --> 37:05.473
men, soldiers, horses, cattle, everything.

37:05.556 --> 37:07.892
It was absolutely dreadful.

37:07.975 --> 37:10.144
We saw an officer laid out.

37:10.228 --> 37:13.606
He was dead, lying on the--

37:13.689 --> 37:17.443
"Oh," I said,
and all his little photographs

37:17.526 --> 37:21.072
were hanging out
of his children, everything.

37:21.864 --> 37:23.407
[narrator] <i>Despite the horrors,</i>

37:23.491 --> 37:27.119
<i>the soldiers had no choice</i>
<i>but to keep moving.</i>

37:27.203 --> 37:29.038
People crying, "Help me, help me."

37:29.121 --> 37:34.877
It was a fiasco,
absolutely a fiasco.

37:35.670 --> 37:38.798
When I saw those poor lads
being blown to pieces,

37:39.674 --> 37:43.386
and you just ignore it,
you just ignore it.

37:43.469 --> 37:45.596
You know it's happened and it's gone.

37:46.430 --> 37:49.600
[J. Haward] <i>It was really terrible</i>
<i>to see these women and children</i>

37:49.684 --> 37:52.436
<i>being injured and that,</i>

37:52.520 --> 37:55.648
<i>but there was not much</i>
<i>we could do about it, you know.</i>

37:55.731 --> 37:58.067
[H. Garrett] We couldn't save anybody.

37:58.150 --> 38:04.323
When you're going through on an action,
you despair and you did your best,

38:04.407 --> 38:06.200
but you know you had a job to do.

38:07.076 --> 38:10.413
[E. Barry] There was a little boy
who came home from school

38:10.496 --> 38:13.541
and he found his house had been bombed

38:13.624 --> 38:15.960
and his mother and father were killed,

38:17.128 --> 38:20.631
and he said, "Where's my mummy?"

38:21.340 --> 38:23.759
Then he followed the soldiers with us.

38:23.843 --> 38:27.680
[E. Oates]

38:34.937 --> 38:37.690
[E. Barry] Oh, my feet were terrible.

38:37.773 --> 38:40.735
The soldiers kept putting me
on their backs

38:40.818 --> 38:43.195
because I couldn't walk anymore.

38:43.279 --> 38:44.947
I was only a little kid.

38:45.031 --> 38:46.699
Oh, it was awful.

38:46.782 --> 38:50.202
Well, my father gave up.
He didn't want to.

38:50.286 --> 38:53.581
He said, "I'm not going any further.
The Bosh can have me."

[J. Levine] <i>The person with the overall</i>

39:16.562 --> 39:18.814

39:18.898 --> 39:20.941
<i>In fact, working from the Dynamo room.</i>

39:21.025 --> 39:23.277
[R. Willard- Wright] And the message
came through here

39:23.361 --> 39:25.821
that Operation Dynamo was to commence.

39:25.905 --> 39:29.158
Things had to be done so quickly.

39:29.784 --> 39:34.413
You hadn't got weeks to plan what to do.
It had to be done immediately.

39:34.497 --> 39:36.582
[machines chirping]

39:36.665 --> 39:40.252
[narrator] <i>The recovery</i>
<i>was no ordinary military operation.</i>

39:40.336 --> 39:42.963
<i>Admiral Ramsey devised an evacuation</i>

39:43.047 --> 39:46.008
<i>involving over 900 vessels.</i>

[J. Levine] <i>The port of Dunkirk</i>

39:50.137 --> 39:54.058
<i>had been almost</i>
<i>completely destroyed by the Luftwaffe.</i>

39:54.141 --> 39:56.060
[R. Willard-Wright]
<i>It was almost unusable.</i>

39:56.143 --> 39:59.021
<i>So all you had, was the beaches.</i>

39:59.105 --> 40:01.982
[J. Levine] <i>The trouble was,</i>
<i>the ships were too large</i>

40:02.066 --> 40:04.360
<i>to come in close to the beaches.</i>

40:04.443 --> 40:06.695
<i>The beaches were very, very shallow.</i>

40:06.779 --> 40:09.865
[R. Willard-Wright] <i>It was a flat, vast,</i>

40:09.949 --> 40:12.243
<i>duney beach.</i>

40:12.326 --> 40:14.245
<i>Which is great if you want to sunbathe,</i>

40:14.328 --> 40:18.290
<i>but if you're trying to get</i>
<i>large destroyers up to it</i>

40:18.374 --> 40:20.793
<i>and get men off the beach,</i>
<i>it's impossible.</i>

40:20.876 --> 40:22.628
<i>And that is what they found.</i>

40:22.711 --> 40:25.840
What was needed, were smaller boats

40:25.923 --> 40:28.509
that could actually ferry the soldiers

40:28.592 --> 40:33.639
from the beaches to the larger naval
and civilian ships offshore.

40:35.683 --> 40:38.727
[narrator] <i>The British government</i>
<i>appealed for small civilian crafts</i>

40:38.811 --> 40:40.938
<i>to join the rescue mission.</i>

40:41.021 --> 40:46.360
<i>The operation would become the</i>
<i>biggest evacuation in military history.</i>

40:47.236 --> 40:49.405
[J. Levine] <i>Desperate times</i>
<i>call for desperate measures.</i>

40:49.488 --> 40:51.323
[R. Willard-Wright] It came out
by radio to begin with,

40:51.407 --> 40:53.951
and that was it, that's all people knew.

40:54.034 --> 40:56.537
[J. Levine] It wasn't until very late on
in the evacuation

40:56.620 --> 41:00.833
that the newspapers and the radio even
reported that there was an evacuation.

41:00.916 --> 41:02.543
It was kept secret.

41:03.294 --> 41:05.129
[J. Delaney]
It was all done in such a rush,

41:05.212 --> 41:08.299
the requirement to requisition the vessels
sort of came overnight.

41:08.382 --> 41:10.009
It was organized chaos

41:10.092 --> 41:12.803
and everybody who could lend
a hand, lent a hand.

41:12.887 --> 41:14.180
[J. Levine] <i>A lot of the time,</i>

41:14.263 --> 41:16.807
<i>the owners had no idea</i>
<i>that their boats were being taken.</i>

41:16.891 --> 41:19.101
[J. Delaney] If the owner
happened to be nearby,

41:19.185 --> 41:20.769
then they could join in with the project.

41:20.853 --> 41:23.606
If not, the Navy basically
went along and just took them.

41:27.651 --> 41:30.237
[narrator]
<i>Arriving at the outskirts of Dunkirk,</i>

41:30.321 --> 41:34.325
<i>many of the exhausted soldiers</i>
<i>had not eaten for days.</i>

41:35.743 --> 41:38.078
[A. Smith] I drove 48 hours,

41:38.996 --> 41:42.208
kept falling asleep at the wheel,
hitting the curb, waking up,

41:43.501 --> 41:45.544
and eventually arrived at the beach.

41:46.295 --> 41:47.630
[A. Taylor] I went into a cafe

41:47.713 --> 41:50.591
and asked if we could have
some water in our bottles

41:50.674 --> 41:52.968
because we had had no drink.

41:53.677 --> 41:57.806
And the lady said, "I'm sorry,
we've got no water in Dunkirk.

41:57.890 --> 42:00.809
The Germans have blown up the waterworks."

42:00.893 --> 42:05.397
She said, "But I will fill it
with <i>vin rouge</i>."

42:05.481 --> 42:07.691
So we had <i>vin rouge</i> for the beach.

42:07.775 --> 42:10.986
[H. Garrett] I said,
"Look at that warehouse over there.

42:11.070 --> 42:13.072
Look, it's empty, there's nobody there."

42:13.155 --> 42:14.823
I said, "Give me your rifle."

42:14.907 --> 42:18.911
So I got his rifle
and I bang, bang, bang,

42:18.994 --> 42:21.914
about five shots with it, opened the door,

42:21.997 --> 42:25.209
and when I opened up this door,
you would never believe this.

42:25.292 --> 42:28.379
It was full of neat Jamaica rum,

42:28.462 --> 42:30.714
loads of Carnation milk,

42:30.798 --> 42:33.050
biscuits, everything you wanted.

42:33.133 --> 42:34.677
It was gonna be left for the Germans.

42:34.760 --> 42:39.139
[adventurous music crescendos]

42:40.015 --> 42:42.142
[ominous music]

42:46.021 --> 42:49.149
[narrator]
<i>Dunkirk was a military disaster.</i>

42:49.233 --> 42:52.736
<i>The loss of equipment</i>
<i>to the British Army was colossal.</i>

42:55.114 --> 42:57.032
[R. Willard-Wright]
<i>As soon as they got to Dunkirk,</i>

42:57.116 --> 42:59.243
<i>the soldiers were surprised to hear</i>

42:59.326 --> 43:02.329
<i>that they were going to have</i>
<i>to blow up their cars, their tanks,</i>

43:02.413 --> 43:04.665
<i>anything that they'd travelled in</i>
<i>to get there.</i>

43:04.748 --> 43:06.750
[J. Delaney] <i>The vast majority</i>
<i>of the equipment</i>

43:06.834 --> 43:09.420
<i>that the British Army had taken</i>
<i>to France with them, was lost.</i>

43:09.503 --> 43:12.381
<i>All their heavy artillery,</i>
<i>virtually all their vehicles,</i>

43:12.464 --> 43:14.592
<i>all those had to be abandoned in France,</i>

43:14.675 --> 43:16.844
<i>because they couldn't get them back</i>
<i>across the Channel.</i>

43:16.927 --> 43:19.221
[R. Willard-Wright] They were told
to put sand into the tanks

43:19.305 --> 43:21.849
so that the engine
would completely seize up.

43:21.932 --> 43:25.144
Because they didn't want the Germans
to have any of their equipment.

43:25.227 --> 43:28.105
But as every soldier has drummed into him,

43:28.188 --> 43:31.066
they didn't leave their rifles behind.

43:31.150 --> 43:33.986
[A. Smith] You were put on a charge
if you'd lose your rifle.

43:34.069 --> 43:36.614
That was more valuable to them
than your life.

43:38.198 --> 43:41.910
[A. Taylor] My 1500-weight van
went into the canal

43:41.994 --> 43:44.204
with my kit bag, camera,

43:44.288 --> 43:47.333
with some films
that would be worth a fortune now.

43:47.416 --> 43:49.293
[J. Haward] <i>We smashed up all the lorries.</i>

43:49.376 --> 43:51.003
<i>We couldn't take them to England.</i>

43:51.086 --> 43:54.256
[H. Garrett] <i>We took our machine guns</i>
<i>out the lorry.</i>

43:54.340 --> 43:56.467
<i>Drove the lorries over the machine guns</i>

43:56.550 --> 43:58.761
<i>till they were destroyed.</i>

43:58.844 --> 44:00.512
<i>Then cut all the pipes on the lorries</i>

44:00.596 --> 44:03.599
<i>and left them running,</i>
<i>but they'd seize up.</i>

44:14.276 --> 44:17.196
[E. Barry] There was
a big hotel on the seafront.

44:17.279 --> 44:19.490
We went down into the cellar.

44:19.573 --> 44:23.911
We dived in, you know,
and we saw other people in there.

44:23.994 --> 44:28.165
And this woman she said, "Don't bother.
Come in", she said.

44:28.248 --> 44:32.044
And there were beds there
and we laid there for a while,

44:32.127 --> 44:34.463
and it was all right,

44:34.546 --> 44:37.091
but we couldn't go
to the toilet or anything.

44:37.174 --> 44:40.052
[ominous music]

44:40.135 --> 44:42.221
We had a machine gun on the toilet

44:42.304 --> 44:45.015
where they were firing,
keeping the enemy away.

44:45.099 --> 44:48.394
But it didn't seem
to make any difference.

44:49.353 --> 44:51.939
You couldn't do anything with money.

44:52.022 --> 44:55.776
There was money
lying in the street, useless.

44:55.859 --> 44:58.320
[ominous music]

45:08.455 --> 45:12.251
[A. Taylor] After we got to the beach,
the Lieutenant said to me,

45:12.334 --> 45:15.087
"You're air force and these are all army,

45:15.170 --> 45:18.465
and if they get hold of you,
you'll get beaten up."

45:19.967 --> 45:23.762
Because they could see
no support from the air.

45:24.388 --> 45:26.515
He said, "But what you'll have to do,

45:26.598 --> 45:30.102
take your shoes off
and put some boots on,

45:30.185 --> 45:33.439
a mackintosh, and a tin hat."

45:33.522 --> 45:37.359
So I was completely disguised
as an army chaplain.

45:39.945 --> 45:42.197
[narrator]
<i>As tens of thousands of soldiers</i>

45:42.281 --> 45:44.867
<i>congregated on the sands at Dunkirk,</i>

<i>they were confronted</i>
<i>with scenes of destruction</i>

45:47.411 --> 45:48.912
<i>they would never forget.</i>

45:50.581 --> 45:53.000
[J. Haward]
<i>It was all on fire down the beach.</i>

45:55.002 --> 45:56.587
[H. Garrett] We got attacked
by the bombers

45:56.670 --> 45:59.298
and the Stukas were coming down
and dive-bombing on the beach.

46:00.549 --> 46:03.427
People don't realize but, my God,

46:03.510 --> 46:07.514
you saw all your mates
being blown to pieces,

46:07.598 --> 46:09.349
ships being blown apart.

46:09.433 --> 46:11.226

46:14.688 --> 46:16.815
[A. Smith] <i>You had big cannons going off.</i>

46:16.899 --> 46:18.942
[E. Oates]

46:28.243 --> 46:30.496
[J. Haward]
<i>We just had to lie in the sand.</i>

46:30.579 --> 46:32.289
<i>It was all rather nasty.</i>

46:32.372 --> 46:34.708
[A. Smith] <i>Forces and bombers</i>
<i>kept coming over</i>

46:34.791 --> 46:36.502
<i>machine-gunning the beach.</i>

46:36.585 --> 46:38.045
<i>No protection at all.</i>

46:38.128 --> 46:40.672
<i>And you just sat on the beach,</i>
<i>nowhere to go.</i>

46:40.756 --> 46:44.259
<i>So you just sat there</i>
<i>and hoped that they'd miss you.</i>

46:45.177 --> 46:48.138
[H. Garrett] <i>We used to make</i>
<i>a dugout, we would dig up the sand,</i>

46:48.222 --> 46:49.890
<i>put a tin roof on it,</i>

46:49.973 --> 46:53.018
<i>and make a hole</i>
<i>so you could crawl in.</i>

46:53.936 --> 46:57.981
[A. Taylor] <i>The part of the beach that</i>
<i>I was on, there were no officers at all.</i>

47:05.656 --> 47:06.907
[tense, rhythmic music]

47:11.036 --> 47:13.413
There's bodies lying all over the place.

47:13.497 --> 47:15.332
We had to bury a lot,

47:15.415 --> 47:19.169
and where we buried them,
they put bottles.

47:19.253 --> 47:23.590
And I didn't know till, well, recently…

47:24.550 --> 47:26.301
they put the bottles there

47:26.385 --> 47:28.220
to know where they were buried

47:28.303 --> 47:30.472
so that they could take them up again.

47:30.556 --> 47:32.975

47:38.438 --> 47:42.484
[narrator] <i>Morale plummeted</i>

[J. Delaney] <i>There was a general sense</i>

49:16.370 --> 49:17.871
[J. Levine] The Royal Air Force
and Fighting Command

49:17.954 --> 49:20.749
were being vilified
by the soldiers and sailors

49:20.832 --> 49:23.669
who felt the RAF
weren't defending them at Dunkirk.

49:23.752 --> 49:26.421
Every time they looked up in the sky,
they only saw Germans.

49:26.505 --> 49:28.507
Where were the RAF?

49:29.424 --> 49:33.095
[plane engine whirring]

49:33.178 --> 49:37.516
[A. Smith] We had one RAF Spitfire
come across the beach

49:37.599 --> 49:41.478
and everybody cheered, a British plane.

49:41.561 --> 49:45.691
And this British plane came down
and machine-gunned us.

49:45.774 --> 49:48.944
It was a Spitfire that had been captured
by the Germans

49:49.027 --> 49:51.029
and the Germans were using it.

49:52.197 --> 49:53.824
[J. Levine] Airmen who had been downed

49:53.907 --> 49:57.619
or who were working on the ground, who
were trying to get back onboard ships

49:57.703 --> 50:00.789
to go back to Britain,
they were basically turned away

50:00.872 --> 50:03.917
or they were attacked by people saying,
"You're not getting on board.

50:04.000 --> 50:05.585
You haven't helped us, off you go."

50:05.669 --> 50:08.046
That's how much they were vilified.

50:08.547 --> 50:11.216
[J. Haward] I thought that was
a bit uncalled for.

50:11.925 --> 50:14.052
[A. Smith] We'd heard
when we came back to England

50:14.136 --> 50:18.098
how the RAF were protecting
the troops on the beach.

50:18.932 --> 50:20.392
Well, not on our beach.

50:40.746 --> 50:42.456
[J. Levine] <i>The soldiers and sailors</i>

50:44.791 --> 50:49.713
<i>The fact is, it was really unfair</i>

50:49.796 --> 50:53.008
[J. Delaney] The air battles over Dunkirk
were actually quite intense.

50:53.091 --> 50:57.345
They were there, they just weren't
directly over the beach.

50:57.429 --> 51:00.599
A Spitfire overflying the beach
is going at well over 300 miles an hour

51:00.682 --> 51:02.809
and is gonna be over the beach
for a fraction of a second,

51:02.893 --> 51:04.019
a couple of seconds at most.

51:04.102 --> 51:07.355
The air-to-air combat that took place
to try and stop the Germans

51:07.439 --> 51:11.276
from getting to the beach
was seven miles inland,

51:11.359 --> 51:14.946
so it would've been out of the line
of sight of the guys on the beach anyway.

51:15.030 --> 51:16.364
[H. Garrett] <i>They were there.</i>

51:16.448 --> 51:20.577
<i>Perhaps not over the beaches,</i>
<i>but a bit farther inland or out to sea.</i>

51:20.660 --> 51:23.288
[J. Levine] You had this
extraordinary standoff

51:23.371 --> 51:25.207
and of course at the time
of the Battle of Britain,

51:25.290 --> 51:28.376
the entire attitude to the RAF changed

51:28.460 --> 51:30.212
and they became the nation's heroes.

[H. Garrett] <i>I never stopped praying.</i>

51:59.533 --> 52:01.827
[J. Haward] A lot of them
might've changed their minds

52:01.910 --> 52:04.287
when they got off
but we used to have a saying.

52:04.371 --> 52:08.458
We used to dig these small trenches
which we called slit trenches

52:08.542 --> 52:12.629
and we used to say, "There were
no atheists in a slit trench."

52:12.712 --> 52:15.882
You know what I mean,
when all this nasty stuff was coming up.

52:15.966 --> 52:18.510
So that's just my personal opinion.

52:18.593 --> 52:22.389
It was wonderful to see
so many men praying.

52:23.348 --> 52:27.853
They've probably not prayed since,
but I did a lot.

52:27.936 --> 52:30.313
[E. Barry] We were
in the cellar for a week

52:30.397 --> 52:33.692
and they brought out baskets
with the rosaries in

52:33.775 --> 52:37.320
and we all had to have a rosary,
and we all stood there and prayed.

52:37.404 --> 52:39.656
My mother was very courageous.

52:39.739 --> 52:41.700
She said, "If we get through Dunkirk,

52:41.783 --> 52:44.661
we'll get through anything."
And she was right.

is this long breakwater,

53:05.891 --> 53:09.603
this long arm, called the mole."

53:09.686 --> 53:12.772
It was never intended for a ship
to come along side it, never at all.

53:12.856 --> 53:16.902
It was just to stop the sand running
into the harbour and silting it up.

53:16.985 --> 53:18.653
[J. Delaney] <i>He immediately</i>

Or you could find
that your sea was afire,

had been shot by German aircraft
or they were being bombed out the water.

and it was on its side

58:41.643 --> 58:43.811
and it appeared to be on fire.

58:43.895 --> 58:45.772
There was all this smoke coming from it,

58:45.855 --> 58:50.401
but we saw some people getting on it
and so we went and explored.

58:50.485 --> 58:54.614
They were burning oily rags
to make out it was on fire,

58:54.697 --> 58:59.702
so we got on the boat and this boat
must have been used for taking coal.

58:59.786 --> 59:01.454
It was all coal dust.

59:01.538 --> 59:06.209
Every time a shell or bomb burst,
all this coal dust came out

59:06.292 --> 59:10.296

like the black and white minstrels.

59:36.739 --> 59:38.199
called The Lord Gray.

59:38.283 --> 59:43.162
And he counted us on and he said,
"That's enough now, off you go."

59:43.246 --> 59:46.291
So I laid down
and went to sleep straight away.

she said, "We're not going
for the big ships."

1:00:32.962 --> 1:00:35.757
Because they were bombing
them like billy-o.

1:00:35.840 --> 1:00:39.052
So we got on this little oil tanker
called The Sutton.

1:00:39.135 --> 1:00:41.220
We had the captain's cabin,

1:00:41.304 --> 1:00:44.432
and we were told
we could be bombed any minute.

1:00:44.515 --> 1:00:49.771
It was so dangerous to get through
all this debris and everything.

1:00:49.854 --> 1:00:53.066
We had to go through fire to get out.

1:00:53.733 --> 1:00:55.276
[H. Garrett] The bombs were coming down

1:00:55.360 --> 1:00:58.863

1:02:11.477 --> 1:02:13.604
[cheers and applause]

1:02:15.189 --> 1:02:18.109
[H. Garrett] <i>We'd just lost a battle,</i>
<i>but these people in England</i>

1:02:18.192 --> 1:02:20.528
<i>were treating us like heroes.</i>

1:02:21.821 --> 1:02:24.824
[A. Smith] The thing that
I can still see to this day,

1:02:24.907 --> 1:02:28.953
doesn't sound very much, I know,
but it was amazing.

1:02:29.954 --> 1:02:31.998
<i>As we came into Harwich,</i>

1:02:32.081 --> 1:02:35.835
there were hundreds
of women on the docks

1:02:35.918 --> 1:02:38.755
and they'd all obviously been told,

1:02:38.838 --> 1:02:42.967
"As soon as the ships start coming off,
grab a soldier and look after him."

1:02:43.050 --> 1:02:46.637
[J. Haward] Standing on the quayside
were all these lovely ladies

1:02:46.721 --> 1:02:50.641
and they all wanted to get hold
of the wounded hero, me.

1:02:50.725 --> 1:02:54.729
And I was in more trouble
from these ladies from the WVS

1:02:54.812 --> 1:02:56.355
than any bloody German.

1:02:57.064 --> 1:02:58.775
They were all trying to grab me.

1:02:58.858 --> 1:03:02.445
The medical officer said,
"You'll still warm, you'll do."

1:03:02.528 --> 1:03:04.071
[laughs]

1:03:04.864 --> 1:03:09.202
[A. Smith] Some lady got a hold of my arm,
took me into a hangar,

1:03:09.285 --> 1:03:11.954
gave me some tea and sandwiches,

1:03:12.622 --> 1:03:15.291
My co-driver, he survived,

1:03:15.374 --> 1:03:19.295
and he was telling everybody
that I saved his life.

1:03:20.505 --> 1:03:22.215
Well, I didn't really.

1:03:22.298 --> 1:03:24.926
I was driving the lorry,
he was in the back, drunk

1:03:25.009 --> 1:03:27.261
and I got him to the beach

1:03:28.179 --> 1:03:31.474
and got him out
before we destroyed the lorry.

1:03:31.557 --> 1:03:34.435
So in a way, I suppose you could say
I saved him

1:03:34.519 --> 1:03:37.271
but not really.

1:03:37.355 --> 1:03:39.482
[H. Garrett] <i>When we finally reassembled,</i>

1:03:39.565 --> 1:03:44.195
<i>I was surprised at how many</i>
<i>of my battalion had managed to get back.</i>

1:03:44.278 --> 1:03:46.239
[E. Barry] <i>It was a miracle we got out.</i>

1:03:46.322 --> 1:03:49.116
<i>The people were very good</i>
<i>when we got to England.</i>

1:03:49.200 --> 1:03:52.370
<i>They helped us out, gave us clothes.</i>

1:03:52.453 --> 1:03:54.622
<i>We had nothing, we had to be stripped,</i>

1:03:54.705 --> 1:03:59.961
<i>and bathed, and fumigated,</i>
<i>and God knows what.</i>

1:04:01.212 --> 1:04:05.258
[H. Garrett] Dunkirk to me
was an epic of absolute bravery.

1:04:05.341 --> 1:04:08.928
I went through hell to get out of hell.

1:04:09.011 --> 1:04:11.264
I got back safe and sound.

1:04:12.348 --> 1:04:14.642
[laughing emotionally]

[narrator] <i>Operation Dynamo</i>

1:04:21.691 --> 1:04:24.861

1:04:25.653 --> 1:04:29.490
<i>The campaign narrowly avoided</i>
<i>a surrender to Hitler</i>

1:04:29.574 --> 1:04:32.660

<i>But, to the soldiers</i>

1:04:37.665 --> 1:04:39.250

1:04:40.293 --> 1:04:43.337
[J. Levine] The British soldiers
who were evacuated back,

1:04:43.421 --> 1:04:47.675
saw themselves as a sort
of battered remnant of a defeated army.

1:04:47.758 --> 1:04:51.679
They'd been part of a terrible defeat.
They came home ashamed.

1:04:59.520 --> 1:05:02.815
[R. Willard-Wright] These were heroes
because they'd survived,

1:05:02.899 --> 1:05:06.027
and it meant that we had
a future in Britain.

[J. Delaney] <i>What Dunkirk did,</i>

1:05:07.904 --> 1:05:10.656
<i>was it enabled the British</i>
<i>to stay in the war.</i>

1:05:10.740 --> 1:05:13.242

1:05:16.370 --> 1:05:20.416
It was amazing, you know,
how many they saved.

1:05:20.499 --> 1:05:23.419
[R. Willard-Wright] They were only
expected to achieve

1:05:23.502 --> 1:05:26.631
a maximum of 45,000 troops.

1:05:26.714 --> 1:05:30.426
They managed, in the end, to reach out

1:05:30.509 --> 1:05:34.889

[A. Smith] My pal and I,
we were together all through the war.

1:07:36.343 --> 1:07:38.512
We both survived Dunkirk.

1:07:39.180 --> 1:07:41.057
But when we went out to the boat,

1:07:41.140 --> 1:07:43.768
we sort of somehow
went in different directions,

1:07:44.351 --> 1:07:48.773
and I assumed that he'd either got killed
or taken prisoner.

1:07:49.857 --> 1:07:52.234
And he thought the same about me.

1:07:53.152 --> 1:07:58.157
And next morning, when I was walking
up the street to get a breakfast,

1:07:58.240 --> 1:08:02.495
and walking down in the opposite
direction was my pal Ginger.

1:08:02.578 --> 1:08:06.332
And he suddenly spotted me and come
and put his arms around me,

1:08:06.415 --> 1:08:09.043

was absolutely amazing.

what the film was called,

1:08:26.018 --> 1:08:27.478
got hit by a bomb,
