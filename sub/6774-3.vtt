00:00.267 --> 00:03.869
     <i> My name is liv moore,</i>
     <i> and i died, sort of.</i>

00:03.871 --> 00:06.238
    <i> I had a promising career</i>
    <i> and a great fiance.</i>

00:06.240 --> 00:09.475
 <i> Then i went to the world's</i>
 <i> worst boat party</i>
 <i> and got turned into a zombie.</i>

00:09.477 --> 00:11.643
    <i> Now i work at the morgue</i>
    <i> for access to brains,</i>

00:11.645 --> 00:13.512
       <i> But brain eating</i>
       <i> has side effects.</i>

00:13.514 --> 00:15.314
     <i> I take on the victim's</i>
     <i> personality traits</i>

00:15.316 --> 00:18.117
  <i> And have visions which i use</i>
  <i> to help solve their murders.</i>

00:18.119 --> 00:20.252
    <i> I work with a detective</i>
    <i> who thinks i'm a psychic</i>

00:20.254 --> 00:22.021
     <i> And my boss,</i>
     <i> the medical examiner,</i>

00:22.023 --> 00:24.089
      <i> The only person</i>
      <i> who knows my secret.</i>

00:24.091 --> 00:25.724
  <i> I'm a crime-fighting zombie.</i>

00:25.726 --> 00:27.292
    <i> Previously on</i> izombie...

00:27.294 --> 00:28.794
   Getting brains on the job.

00:28.796 --> 00:30.396
    I was hoping
    you might be so inclined

00:30.398 --> 00:31.797
   As to help a brother out.

00:31.799 --> 00:32.931
         What the hell?

00:32.933 --> 00:34.066
        You need to go.

01:03.431 --> 01:05.063
           -(yells)
           -(screams)

01:05.066 --> 01:07.066
   (laughs) you're too easy.

01:07.068 --> 01:08.167
          What a wuss.

01:08.169 --> 01:11.003
       Jackass, that was
       quality b-roll.

01:11.005 --> 01:13.672
     Hey, think that'd make
     a good shot?

01:13.674 --> 01:16.942
  Picture it, serial killer
  sneaks up behind the barrel.

01:18.145 --> 01:21.013
   -(thudding)
   -(laughs) nothing but net.

01:23.951 --> 01:25.217
            (sighs)

01:26.487 --> 01:27.719
            (clanks)

01:28.289 --> 01:29.488
             Clank.

01:29.490 --> 01:31.557
  Whatever. Two out of three.

01:32.626 --> 01:33.926
     (grunting from below)

01:35.830 --> 01:38.130
       It's getting late.
       Maybe we should...

01:38.132 --> 01:39.932
       Now who's a wuss?

01:46.140 --> 01:47.573
      What are you doing?

01:47.575 --> 01:49.208
           (growling)

01:50.411 --> 01:52.077
 There's a hobo in there, man.

01:52.079 --> 01:53.345
 We can cut him into the movie.

01:53.347 --> 01:55.247
 Or maybe it's a serial killer

01:55.249 --> 01:57.416
    And he can cut us
    into stupid virgin stew.

01:58.719 --> 02:00.252
   What if this place
   turned him into a mutant,

02:00.254 --> 02:03.088
       And he's got
       hermit crab hands?

02:03.090 --> 02:06.492
     Then i'm about to have
     three million
     instagram followers.

02:14.135 --> 02:16.535
           (growling)

02:16.537 --> 02:18.604
      (theme song playing)

02:41.795 --> 02:43.562
  I'm hungry. Are you hungry?

02:43.564 --> 02:45.030
  Okay, this is interesting.

02:45.032 --> 02:47.866
    I set up a google alert
    for the search terms
    "seattle, zombie."

02:47.868 --> 02:50.302
 Me, too. No. Uh, i signed up
 for z-date.

02:50.304 --> 02:52.337
  Hmm. You joke,
  but this could be as close

02:52.339 --> 02:54.439
  As we get
  to an early warning system.

02:54.441 --> 02:56.108
   It got a couple of hits.

02:56.110 --> 02:58.911
    Oh, <i> dawn of the dead</i>
    is showing at midnight
    on friday.

02:58.913 --> 03:01.213
     Uh, undertakers' bar
     in capitol hill

03:01.215 --> 03:04.516
   Added the noxious zombie
   to the cocktail menu.

03:04.518 --> 03:07.719
  And a teenager posted
  a picture on his facebook.

03:07.721 --> 03:09.454
     Claims it's a zombie.

03:10.524 --> 03:11.890
           Is it me?

03:12.793 --> 03:14.226
    Check out the location.

03:14.228 --> 03:16.428
      Abandoned shipyard
         on the shore
      of lake washington.

03:16.430 --> 03:19.064
   Well, less than a mile
   from where you got turned
   into a zombie.

03:19.066 --> 03:20.832
     We should at least go
     take a look.

03:20.834 --> 03:23.168
 There are already two zombies,
 me and blaine.

03:23.170 --> 03:25.037
   Now, there may be a third?

03:25.039 --> 03:26.872
       Two's company,
       three's a horde.

03:26.874 --> 03:28.273
 But with great power comes...

03:28.275 --> 03:30.175
      Do not. Seriously.

03:31.178 --> 03:33.879
 Fine! We'll go zombie hunting.

03:33.881 --> 03:36.248
 Solve murders, find zombies.

03:36.250 --> 03:39.117
  Why don't you ever
  suggest anything whimsical?

03:39.119 --> 03:41.320
 So how are we doing
 with our hit-and-run victim?

03:41.322 --> 03:42.554
    Pretty straightforward.

03:42.556 --> 03:44.323
  Cause of death is probably
  the cerebral edema,

03:44.325 --> 03:46.258
 But i need to drain the blood
 from the pericardial sac

03:46.260 --> 03:48.260
    To check
    for heart lacerations.

03:49.630 --> 03:51.597
      (cell phone chiming
      and vibrating)

03:55.502 --> 03:57.169
           (groans)

03:57.171 --> 03:59.605
   (sighs) what's going on?

03:59.607 --> 04:01.306
    You keep getting texts
    that disappoint you.

04:01.308 --> 04:02.841
     They're not the texts
     that i want.

04:02.843 --> 04:04.443
       I hate to pry...

04:04.445 --> 04:06.211
      Said the man
      who keeps asking me

04:06.213 --> 04:08.447
     For my urine samples.
     (chuckles)

04:08.449 --> 04:10.382
        It is in search
        of a cure, liv.

04:10.384 --> 04:11.717
       Don't cheapen it.

04:11.719 --> 04:13.485
    And you shouldn't feel
    compelled to share
    your personal...

04:13.487 --> 04:14.786
    I hit on my ex-fiance.

04:14.788 --> 04:16.120
    You have an ex-fiance?

04:16.123 --> 04:20.058
  Yes, who i broke up with
  because i'm partially dead.

04:20.060 --> 04:21.627
    I didn't wanna risk
    giving him the big "z."

04:21.629 --> 04:25.097
   But then i ate the brain
   of seattle's most
   sensual painter,

04:25.099 --> 04:27.833
      And i tried to jump
      my ex's bones.

04:27.835 --> 04:29.434
     Which is pretty hard
     to explain

04:29.436 --> 04:31.703
    When you can't tell him
    that you're a zombie.

04:31.705 --> 04:34.273
  For him, i just dumped him
  and then hit on him,

04:34.275 --> 04:36.375
       Like the world's
       cruelest tease.

04:36.377 --> 04:39.311
  So i texted him an apology
  and he hasn't responded.

04:39.313 --> 04:41.113
        -That's awful.
        -Yeah.

04:41.115 --> 04:42.881
   You texted your apology.

04:42.883 --> 04:45.851
 It seems to beg for
 a face-to-face conversation,
 don't you think?

04:45.853 --> 04:47.786
 Uh, i am too hungry right now

04:47.788 --> 04:49.588
   To work out
   if you're joking or not.

04:49.590 --> 04:53.258
  Your skull just turned
  into a giant animated ham.

04:53.260 --> 04:56.795
      All righty, then.
      Let's see. (sighs)

04:56.797 --> 05:00.632
 Marvin webster here,
 family man, two kids, suburbs,

05:00.634 --> 05:02.901
     Owner operator
     of sea-tac bug whack

05:02.903 --> 05:05.971
  Until someone ran him over
  in the whole lotta lotta
  car park.

05:05.973 --> 05:07.873
    Should be a pretty safe
    brain to eat.

05:07.875 --> 05:10.275
      Said nobody. Ever.

05:12.513 --> 05:13.879
          (whirring)

05:16.317 --> 05:18.650
     Liv: <i> In my old life,</i>
    <i> i was a lot of things.</i>

05:18.652 --> 05:20.585
     <i> A doctor, a fiancee,</i>

05:20.587 --> 05:21.987
       <i> A fan of pilates.</i>

05:21.989 --> 05:23.822
   <i> Now, i'm only one thing.</i>

05:23.824 --> 05:26.692
       <i> I'm a stomach,</i>
       <i> hunger incarnate.</i>

05:26.694 --> 05:28.026
       <i> When i'm hungry,</i>

05:28.028 --> 05:30.495
     <i> I forget my lunch</i>
     <i> used to be a person.</i>

05:30.497 --> 05:32.164
     <i> When the hunger's bad,</i>

05:32.166 --> 05:33.999
       <i> I forget i used to</i>
       <i> be one, too.</i>

05:35.769 --> 05:37.669
          That's hot.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.237
 I think i saw that exact pose

05:39.239 --> 05:41.106
       In the centerfold
       of <i> zombie playboy.</i>

05:44.178 --> 05:45.711
       Liv: You shouldn't
       be here, blaine.

05:45.713 --> 05:48.580
     Why'd you stand me up
     last night?

05:48.582 --> 05:51.750
    You were bringing me
    some of your bountiful
    brain supply, remember?

05:51.752 --> 05:53.418
      I guess you got busy
      and forgot.

05:53.420 --> 05:55.821
   You know, since that's
   the sort of thing
   that slips people's minds.

05:55.823 --> 05:57.622
   Buy milk,
   take out the garbage,
   feed the starving zombie.

05:57.624 --> 05:59.057
      Who can keep track?

05:59.059 --> 06:01.126
 I didn't know how to reach out
 to tell you i wasn't coming.

06:01.128 --> 06:03.395
    Is that your way
    of asking for my number?

06:04.064 --> 06:05.530
             Uh...

06:05.532 --> 06:06.865
  I have to get back to work.

06:06.867 --> 06:09.334
 Right. Work, here in
 a bottomless buffet of brains

06:09.336 --> 06:11.436
     Ripe for tupperwaring.

06:11.438 --> 06:14.840
     This thing right here,
     does it have a name?

06:14.842 --> 06:16.575
        It's a bone saw.

06:16.577 --> 06:18.643
    You use that
    to cut into skulls, huh?

06:19.613 --> 06:20.679
       Think for a second

06:20.681 --> 06:22.447
      What you'd do
      to get into a skull

06:22.449 --> 06:24.883
    If you didn't work here.

06:24.885 --> 06:26.585
      How would you do it?

06:26.587 --> 06:28.854
 An ice pick's no good.
 You have to stab it 100 times.

06:28.856 --> 06:31.456
     A handsaw works,
     but it takes forever.

06:32.459 --> 06:34.526
     The best thing
     i found is a rock.

06:34.528 --> 06:36.728
    You made me this thing.

06:36.730 --> 06:39.297
       I don't trust you.

06:39.299 --> 06:41.433
       I may not think
       you're a murderer,

06:41.435 --> 06:44.136
   But i think you're likely
   still the same
   drug-dealing knob

06:44.138 --> 06:45.637
  Who groped me on that boat.

06:46.607 --> 06:49.274
   Oh, that's pretty clear.

06:49.276 --> 06:51.076
      So it's every zombie
      for himself, huh?

06:52.012 --> 06:53.445
          I guess so.

06:55.115 --> 06:56.181
              Hey.

06:56.650 --> 06:57.749
              Hey.

06:59.953 --> 07:01.520
 Is that a bottle of champagne?

07:01.522 --> 07:04.122
   Wow, look at you,
   all cop-like.
   Nothing's getting by you.

07:04.124 --> 07:06.057
      -Are we celebrating?
      -I hope so.

07:06.059 --> 07:08.960
      Otherwise, i'm gonna
      get really hammered
      two-fisting this.

07:08.962 --> 07:10.695
  And what are we celebrating?

07:10.697 --> 07:13.298
 The wally walker murder case.

07:13.300 --> 07:16.067
    High-tech whiz kid
    mugged and murdered
    in a park. Heard of it?

07:16.069 --> 07:18.103
  Nope, but here's
  to wally's untimely demise.

07:19.206 --> 07:21.606
    Oh. Uh, check this out.

07:21.608 --> 07:24.876
    <i> I wanna thank don watts</i>
    <i> and freddy brown</i>

07:24.878 --> 07:27.012
      <i> For helping to find</i>
      <i> my husband's killer.</i>

07:27.014 --> 07:30.482
     Okay. So, that is
     wally walker's widow.

07:30.484 --> 07:33.952
  And, uh, that eye candy
  is walker's angel investor.

07:33.954 --> 07:36.922
  He offered a reward
  for any information leading
  to the killer's arrest.

07:36.924 --> 07:38.457
     Oh, and, uh,
     that compelling fellow

07:38.459 --> 07:40.292
    Is freddy brown.
    He collected the reward.

07:41.361 --> 07:42.427
          Wait for it.

07:43.764 --> 07:45.764
     Oh, my god! It's you!
     In your power suit!

07:45.766 --> 07:47.933
  (laughs) hell, yeah, it is!

07:47.935 --> 07:49.568
   Ah. My first murder case.

07:49.570 --> 07:51.269
 I... I'm officially on my way.

07:51.271 --> 07:54.806
  The da is putting
  a lot of faith in me. So...

07:54.808 --> 07:56.308
 Can you help me prep my cross?

07:56.310 --> 07:57.943
      Like old times, hmm?

07:57.945 --> 07:59.544
 You get to play gus williams,
 the murderer,

07:59.546 --> 08:00.946
    A cold, detached loner.

08:00.948 --> 08:03.648
  I think i can dial that in.

08:03.650 --> 08:05.650
 Mr. Williams, when the police
 picked you up,

08:05.652 --> 08:07.052
  You had mr. Walker's wallet,

08:07.054 --> 08:09.120
     Credit cards and shoes
     in your possession.

08:09.122 --> 08:10.822
      Is there a question?

08:10.824 --> 08:12.757
   Oh, just the obvious one.

08:12.759 --> 08:15.527
 How did these items
 come to be in your possession?

08:15.529 --> 08:17.662
  I was in the park
  looking for a place to sleep

08:17.664 --> 08:19.364
 And i stumbled upon his body.

08:19.366 --> 08:20.599
        I took his shoes
        and his wallet.

08:20.601 --> 08:23.301
   It didn't seem like
   he needed them any longer.

08:23.303 --> 08:25.937
       Was this the man
       you stumbled upon?

08:30.244 --> 08:32.544
      Wait a minute, okay?
      The money's coming!

08:32.546 --> 08:35.413
   I swear to god,
   i'm gonna pay it all off!
   Just tell him!

08:35.414 --> 08:37.048
  Tell him the money's coming.

08:37.049 --> 08:38.582
      Marvin: That's what
      they always say.

08:39.119 --> 08:40.385
            (gasps)

08:41.822 --> 08:43.621
            Uh, liv?

08:44.625 --> 08:46.825
         I killed him.

08:46.827 --> 08:48.527
  Hey, now, i'm not that good.

08:57.037 --> 09:00.171
     So, wally walker trial
     starts today.

09:00.173 --> 09:01.573
   Big win for the cops, huh?

09:01.575 --> 09:03.408
     Beloved tech innovator
     mugged and murdered

09:03.410 --> 09:05.176
    Just before his company
    goes public.

09:05.178 --> 09:07.178
     But the city's finest
     get their man,

09:07.180 --> 09:08.246
    A drifter with a record.

09:08.248 --> 09:09.848
       The city is safe,
       everyone's happy.

09:09.850 --> 09:12.717
  It's not my case.
  I'm working the hit-and-run,
  remember?

09:12.719 --> 09:14.386
       The poor schmo
       that got run over
       in the parking lot?

09:14.388 --> 09:15.820
    Yeah. Here's the thing,

09:15.822 --> 09:17.522
    The drifter didn't kill
    wally walker,

09:17.524 --> 09:19.291
      The poor schmo did.

09:19.293 --> 09:21.826
    Marvin webster,
    our hit-and-run victim?

09:21.828 --> 09:24.529
    I had a vision of him
    murdering wally walker.

09:24.531 --> 09:25.630
       This is important.

09:26.366 --> 09:28.133
    When you had the vision,

09:28.135 --> 09:30.235
        Were you holding
        an apple bong,

09:30.237 --> 09:32.003
     Or did you just smoke
     an old-school spliff?

09:32.005 --> 09:33.271
    I'm not
    screwing around, clive.

09:33.273 --> 09:35.340
 I'm just wondering
 if this vision also contained

09:35.342 --> 09:37.375
      Winged horses
      and a dancing pizza.

09:37.377 --> 09:39.077
       I'm not saying
       you didn't see it,

09:39.079 --> 09:40.612
   But no psychic bats 1.000.

09:40.614 --> 09:42.280
       You're going after
       the wrong guy.

09:42.282 --> 09:43.582
 And from what i could gather,

09:43.584 --> 09:45.650
      He's done it before,
      like, a lot.

09:45.652 --> 09:47.686
   How is this guy
   even connected to walker?

09:47.688 --> 09:49.387
  Something to do with debts.

09:52.693 --> 09:54.659
  You want me to go to my boss

09:54.661 --> 09:57.162
  And tell them to stop
  a high-profile murder trial

09:57.164 --> 09:58.964
   Because the morgue medium
   said so?

09:58.966 --> 10:02.334
      The victim was shot
      downward in the head

10:02.336 --> 10:04.536
     From point blank range
     while on his knees,

10:04.538 --> 10:06.438
     That's not a mugging,
     that's an execution.

10:06.440 --> 10:09.274
   The drifter had
   walker's dna all over him.

10:09.276 --> 10:11.209
      He was wearing
      his frickin' shoes.

10:11.211 --> 10:12.911
    A homeless drifter
    who needs to steal shoes

10:12.913 --> 10:15.213
 Doesn't usually pack a glock.

10:15.215 --> 10:16.815
    I saw the murder weapon.

10:16.817 --> 10:18.249
     He used a suppressor,

10:18.251 --> 10:19.718
      More commonly known
      as a silencer,

10:19.720 --> 10:21.820
      Invented by hiram
      percy maxim in 1902.

10:23.757 --> 10:25.724
              Fyi.

10:25.726 --> 10:27.792
   Listen, our job right now
   is to find the person

10:27.794 --> 10:29.728
 That ran over marvin webster.

10:29.730 --> 10:30.862
     It's up to the courts
     to decide

10:30.864 --> 10:32.230
  If gus williams is innocent.

10:32.232 --> 10:33.965
        He is innocent.

10:33.967 --> 10:35.934
   What more do you need
   than, "i saw somebody else
   commit the murder"?

10:35.936 --> 10:38.303
        I need evidence.

10:38.305 --> 10:40.672
 I can't go to
 the powers that be with this.

10:40.674 --> 10:42.774
      You absolutely can.

10:42.776 --> 10:45.276
    You just don't want to.

10:45.278 --> 10:47.445
    You'd rather send
    an innocent man to jail

10:47.447 --> 10:49.080
      Than rock the boat.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.383
        Well, i'd rather
        sleep at night.

10:52.753 --> 10:55.920
    Don't worry, i'll man up
    for the both of us.

10:55.922 --> 10:58.323
    Liv: <i> I just asked clive</i>
   <i> to commit career suicide,</i>

10:58.325 --> 11:00.291
     <i> And then i questioned</i>
     <i> his manhood.</i>

11:00.293 --> 11:03.928
  <i> And i genuinely don't care,</i>
  <i> like, at all.</i>

11:03.930 --> 11:07.098
    <i> Marvin webster had quite</i>
    <i> the superiority complex.</i>

11:07.100 --> 11:10.769
       <i> And zero empathy</i>
       <i> and was a hit man.</i>

11:10.771 --> 11:12.404
        <i> Son of a bitch.</i>
        <i> I ate the brains</i>

11:12.406 --> 11:14.172
        <i> Of a sociopath.</i>

11:14.174 --> 11:15.674
  <i> A term eliminated by the dsm</i>

11:15.676 --> 11:17.308
 <i> In 2004 along with psychopath</i>

11:17.310 --> 11:19.277
   <i> And combined</i>
   <i> into one broader category,</i>

11:19.279 --> 11:21.446
     <i> Antisocial</i>
     <i> personality disorder.</i>

11:21.448 --> 11:22.981
      <i> Void of compassion.</i>

11:22.983 --> 11:25.850
   <i> Full of factoids.</i>
   <i> This brain is gonna suck.</i>

11:29.056 --> 11:30.221
              Hey.

11:30.223 --> 11:31.856
        How's it going?

11:31.858 --> 11:33.058
             Okay.

11:33.060 --> 11:35.326
    So you haven't seen it?

11:38.398 --> 11:39.931
          <i> -Oh!</i>
           -Woman: <i> Oh!</i>

11:39.933 --> 11:41.032
       (people laughing)

11:47.541 --> 11:50.775
   -(jenga pieces clattering)
   -(people gasping)

11:50.777 --> 11:52.377
     I only saw it
     because she tagged him

11:52.379 --> 11:54.979
        And he liked it.

11:54.981 --> 11:57.248
     Which i didn't realize
     would sound so sexual.

11:57.250 --> 11:59.084
     Sorry. (clears throat)

11:59.086 --> 12:01.352
      Regardless,
      this is social media

12:01.354 --> 12:02.721
   For "we're an item," so...

12:02.723 --> 12:03.988
       Did you know
       that december 11th

12:03.990 --> 12:06.391
   Is the most common day
   to get dumped on facebook?

12:07.894 --> 12:09.360
   I don't really know
   what's going on right now.

12:09.362 --> 12:12.097
       Uh, are you, like,
       in shock or...

12:12.099 --> 12:13.732
        No, i'm just...

12:14.901 --> 12:16.568
            Nothing.

12:16.570 --> 12:18.503
  So, you don't wanna mention
  that her laugh is annoying

12:18.505 --> 12:21.840
 Or question why
 they're this frickin' excited
 about jenga?

12:22.709 --> 12:24.008
          Not really.

12:24.010 --> 12:26.444
    Wow. That's impressive.

12:27.581 --> 12:29.848
        Yet concerning.

12:29.850 --> 12:31.216
      (cell phone ringing
      and vibrating)

12:31.218 --> 12:33.551
       -Hey, are you sure
       you're okay?
       -Sure.

12:35.589 --> 12:36.721
             Hello?

12:36.723 --> 12:37.956
        Liv: <i> It's been</i>
       <i> almost six months</i>

12:37.958 --> 12:39.324
       <i> Since i called off</i>
       <i> my engagement</i>

12:39.326 --> 12:41.226
   <i> To the man of my dreams.</i>

12:41.228 --> 12:42.894
     <i> And now, the day</i>
     <i> i've dreaded is here.</i>

12:43.530 --> 12:45.630
        <i> He's moving on.</i>

12:45.632 --> 12:48.133
     <i> I should really</i>
     <i> be feeling something.</i>

12:52.572 --> 12:55.006
       <i> I guess i still</i>
       <i> have my curiosity.</i>

12:55.008 --> 12:56.674
       <i> That's something.</i>

12:57.811 --> 12:59.144
      Liv: If we're lucky,
      that zombie photo

12:59.146 --> 13:00.779
         Is just a dumb
         teenage prank.

13:00.781 --> 13:02.814
      Better safe
      than the apocalypse.

13:02.816 --> 13:05.316
   "the rising world
   of waters dark and deep."

13:05.318 --> 13:08.253
  It's milton, on lakes
  and what hides inside them.

13:08.255 --> 13:11.790
     There are nearly
     8,000 recognized lakes
     in washington state.

13:11.792 --> 13:13.725
   This one's second biggest.

13:13.727 --> 13:16.027
 It's... It's very interesting,
 thank you.

13:16.029 --> 13:17.862
      So, how's this brain
      treating you?

13:17.864 --> 13:20.932
    Like the lone contestant
    on <i> bizarro jeopardy.</i>

13:20.934 --> 13:22.500
       Aside from that,
       i'm totally numb.

13:22.502 --> 13:24.702
  Things that should upset me
  just bounce right off.

13:24.704 --> 13:26.371
  That could have its upside.

13:26.373 --> 13:28.273
      It's actually
      kind of disturbing.

13:28.275 --> 13:30.875
     It's not like apathy,
     it's colder.

13:30.877 --> 13:34.612
  This is the brain of someone
  who could kill people
  and not care.

13:34.614 --> 13:36.381
           (rustling)

13:36.383 --> 13:39.617
       Wait. Did you just
       hear something?

13:39.619 --> 13:42.787
     Like someone moaning
     the word "brains"? No.

13:42.789 --> 13:44.522
    If you heard aimless
    shambling of the undead,

13:44.524 --> 13:45.857
  That might've just been me.

13:45.859 --> 13:47.492
       You don't shamble.

13:48.395 --> 13:50.094
    (grunting and rustling)

13:58.038 --> 13:59.938
 We need to open this up a bit.

14:04.477 --> 14:07.345
     You know, many hit men
     have an antisocial
     personality disorder.

14:07.347 --> 14:09.247
     That's what makes them
     good hit men.

14:09.249 --> 14:10.915
     Yeah. Kind of makes me
     long for the days

14:10.917 --> 14:12.383
    Low blood sugar made me
    a little bitchy.

14:15.188 --> 14:16.254
           (snarling)

14:18.491 --> 14:20.325
  There's something in there.

14:22.529 --> 14:24.429
           (grunting)

14:33.874 --> 14:35.139
             Marcy?

14:35.876 --> 14:37.141
           (grunting)

14:43.783 --> 14:44.949
         You know her?

14:44.951 --> 14:47.218
    This is unbelievable.
    Look at her, she's real.

14:47.220 --> 14:49.187
     Liv: She looks
     like a melted candle.

14:49.189 --> 14:52.223
  Well, she's been in here
  for months and she's alive.

14:52.225 --> 14:53.758
     That's open to debate.

14:53.760 --> 14:56.194
  Marcy was a fellow resident
  at the hospital.

14:56.196 --> 14:57.462
       She invited me
       to the boat party

14:57.464 --> 14:59.898
       Where i was turned
       into a zombie.

14:59.900 --> 15:02.267
     I went to her funeral.
     Her mom was a mess.

15:02.269 --> 15:03.468
     Are you sure it's her?

15:03.470 --> 15:05.436
 Liv: I recognize the necklace.

15:05.438 --> 15:07.171
   Her grandmother's pearls.

15:07.173 --> 15:09.374
   Marcy wore them every day.

15:09.376 --> 15:12.210
    I can't imagine
    how awful this must be,

15:12.212 --> 15:14.846
     Seeing someone
     you knew reduced to...

15:15.282 --> 15:16.581
            Just...

15:17.984 --> 15:19.117
       Did you just throw
       a rock at her?

15:19.986 --> 15:21.452
           Stop that!

15:21.454 --> 15:23.388
  Liv: Why? She doesn't care.

15:23.390 --> 15:25.323
    Still! I know
    your system is swirling

15:25.325 --> 15:26.424
      With hit man brains,

15:26.426 --> 15:28.626
      But let's remember
      to "do unto others."

15:28.628 --> 15:29.894
      Because that
      could be me, right?

15:29.896 --> 15:31.062
    We don't know for sure.

15:31.064 --> 15:32.864
  But we're both thinking it.

15:32.866 --> 15:35.600
     If i went too long
     without eating brains,
     that'd be me.

15:35.602 --> 15:37.635
    Or maybe we can fix her.

15:41.574 --> 15:45.109
   I'm guessing that
   isn't chicken noodle soup.

15:45.111 --> 15:46.978
   What if the deterioration
   is reversible?

15:46.980 --> 15:48.646
    I mean,
    what happens if a zombie

15:48.648 --> 15:50.581
  This far gone gets to feed?

15:52.352 --> 15:54.118
       Marcy! Lunch time!

15:56.523 --> 15:57.956
           (growling)

16:01.261 --> 16:03.094
       That is what
       we in the biz call

16:03.096 --> 16:05.863
   An encouraging
   parasympathetic response.

16:07.133 --> 16:08.399
             Right.

16:12.005 --> 16:13.471
       When we come back,

16:13.473 --> 16:16.374
       Hopefully we find
       a very confused
       cardiac resident.

16:16.376 --> 16:17.475
          Sound good?

16:19.946 --> 16:21.946
      Liv: <i> I can't control</i>
     <i> what happens to marcy,</i>

16:21.948 --> 16:23.781
   <i> But i can solve this case.</i>

16:23.783 --> 16:25.650
     <i> And if marvin's brains</i>
     <i> blot out the memory</i>

16:25.652 --> 16:27.418
     <i> Of the girl who wanted</i>
     <i> to be my friend</i>

16:27.420 --> 16:30.388
   <i> And the ex-fiance</i>
   <i> who still hasn't responded</i>
   <i> to my apology text,</i>

16:30.390 --> 16:32.290
 <i> I say bring on the sociopath.</i>

16:32.292 --> 16:33.391
      Some new information

16:33.393 --> 16:35.159
    Kind of fell in my lap.

16:35.161 --> 16:37.362
    Wally did have
    serious gambling debts.

16:37.364 --> 16:39.530
      Come help me
      lean on his bookie.
      Don't make me beg.

16:39.532 --> 16:40.965
       I'll say it again,

16:40.967 --> 16:43.434
    The wally walker murder
    is not our case.

16:43.436 --> 16:45.603
       The marvin webster
       hit-and-run is.

16:47.540 --> 16:48.840
    Whoever ran down marvin

16:48.842 --> 16:50.441
      -Probably hired him
      to kill wally.
      -(sighs)

16:50.443 --> 16:52.944
  Two murders, one case.
  Come on, work with me here.

16:52.946 --> 16:55.546
       You're making
       quite a leap here.

16:55.548 --> 16:56.814
        You got a name
        for this bookie?

16:56.816 --> 16:57.882
          Frank smith.

16:59.419 --> 17:00.685
             What?

17:00.687 --> 17:03.654
      Frank smith,
      former seattle cop.

17:03.656 --> 17:05.189
    Current owner
    of smitty's bar & grill

17:05.191 --> 17:07.392
   And bookmaker to
   half the cops in the city.

17:07.394 --> 17:08.992
     Great. It's a cop bar.

17:08.994 --> 17:10.862
    Everyone'll have badges.
    We'll blend right in.

17:12.531 --> 17:14.632
     (jovial music playing)

17:17.037 --> 17:18.569
 Welcome to whitey whitesville.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.307
     How do you think
     we're blending so far?

17:23.309 --> 17:24.675
     I remember this place.

17:24.676 --> 17:26.277
    We had our mu theta zeta

17:26.279 --> 17:28.212
      Night in ibiza
      electric wonderland

17:28.214 --> 17:30.081
   With the omega sigs here.

17:30.083 --> 17:31.816
   You should see this place
   when the foam drops.

17:31.818 --> 17:33.184
    This guy knows
    what i'm talking about.

17:33.186 --> 17:35.353
     Uh, low profile.
     Let's go find smitty.

17:37.757 --> 17:38.923
  Clive: Uh, is smitty around?

17:38.925 --> 17:40.024
       Who wants to know?

17:40.026 --> 17:42.293
 Detective babineaux, homicide.

17:42.295 --> 17:44.095
      I'll see if smitty
      feels like chatting.

17:44.097 --> 17:45.229
        (crowd cheering)

17:46.766 --> 17:49.233
       <i> Welcome, masters!</i>

17:49.235 --> 17:51.636
    <i> Trivia masters, that is.</i>
     (giggles)

17:51.638 --> 17:53.037
       <i> Get out your pens.</i>

17:53.039 --> 17:55.606
     <i> -It's trivia tuesday!</i>
      -(crowd cheering)

17:55.608 --> 17:56.908
      <i> I dream of jeannie.</i>

17:56.910 --> 17:58.376
    Can you believe she was
    the idealized female

17:58.378 --> 17:59.577
        For these guys?

17:59.579 --> 18:00.711
      When she got uppity,

18:00.713 --> 18:02.313
      Just shove her back
      in the bottle.

18:02.315 --> 18:04.215
   <i> What was the first western</i>

18:04.217 --> 18:07.185
      <i> To win best picture</i>
      <i> at the oscars?</i>

18:07.187 --> 18:08.886
 <i> Good luck, masters.</i> (giggles)

18:08.888 --> 18:11.456
  It all comes back to being
  called "master," doesn't it?

18:11.458 --> 18:13.124
        <i> Cimarron,</i> 1931.

18:15.028 --> 18:16.994
  Yeah, i'm horribly offended.

18:16.996 --> 18:18.729
     Are you cool with me
     naming our trivia team

18:18.731 --> 18:21.499
     "piggy and the brain"?

18:21.501 --> 18:23.568
  -Smitty'll be down in a few.
  -Oh, thanks.

18:23.570 --> 18:29.107
  <i> Male dayak fruit bats</i>
  <i> are unusual in what regard?</i>

18:29.109 --> 18:32.477
      "they can lactate."

18:33.813 --> 18:35.613
      I'll be right back.

18:35.614 --> 18:37.414
     Trivia genie: <i> Your wish</i>
    <i> is my command,</i>

18:37.417 --> 18:39.584
      <i> If your wish</i>
      <i> is for more trivia!</i>

18:39.586 --> 18:40.718
        -(all cheering)
        -(exclaiming)

18:51.264 --> 18:54.132
  Yeah, wally walker
  owed me money, a lot of it.

18:54.134 --> 18:55.766
    He died owing me money.

18:55.768 --> 18:59.070
  Now, you mind explaining me
  why this is your
  frickin' business?

18:59.072 --> 19:01.305
      Sorry about this.
      You must be smitty.

19:01.307 --> 19:03.574
      Well, let me guess,
      you're babineaux.

19:03.576 --> 19:06.544
   <i> And the winner</i>
   <i> with a perfect score is...</i>

19:06.546 --> 19:09.147
     <i> -Piggy and the brain.</i>
     (giggles)
     -(applause)

19:12.418 --> 19:14.919
   We were hoping
   you could tell us when you
   last saw wally walker.

19:14.921 --> 19:16.187
  June 8th, the night he died.

19:16.189 --> 19:18.956
   He came in here and asked
   for more time to pay.

19:18.958 --> 19:20.958
   Cash flow issues, he said.

19:20.960 --> 19:22.226
       Was that unusual?

19:22.228 --> 19:23.661
    It wasn't the first time
    he'd been in deep.

19:23.663 --> 19:24.929
 But i knew he was good for it.

19:24.931 --> 19:27.865
   He was gonna sell
   his company for fast cash,

19:27.867 --> 19:30.234
   Told me that
   if i gave him two months,

19:30.236 --> 19:31.435
      He'd double my vig.

19:31.437 --> 19:32.904
      So, the man owed you
      a lot of money

19:32.906 --> 19:34.805
       And ended up dead
       later that night?

19:34.807 --> 19:36.174
        Congratulations.

19:36.176 --> 19:38.409
    -Say cheese.
    -(camera shutter clicks)

19:38.411 --> 19:40.978
           -Hmm!
           -Not now.

19:40.980 --> 19:44.215
  Don't they have this guy?
  Didn't he go to trial today?

19:44.217 --> 19:46.150
    We're just going over it
    one more time.

19:46.152 --> 19:48.019
 Suzuki's your lieutenant, huh?

19:48.021 --> 19:50.888
  He likes to get a few bucks
  on the seahawks
  from time to time.

19:50.890 --> 19:52.256
  I should check in with him.

19:52.258 --> 19:55.092
      Let him know
      what a thorough job
      you're doing.

19:55.094 --> 19:57.195
        -Let's go, liv.
        -(laughs)

19:57.197 --> 19:58.796
   You know
   he's stonewalling, right?

19:58.798 --> 20:00.898
 He obviously knows something.

20:01.601 --> 20:03.134
          Stop, clive.

20:03.136 --> 20:05.469
      -You can throw away
      your own career.
      -Look.

20:05.471 --> 20:07.605
   Look who won on june 8th.

20:09.776 --> 20:11.375
     Clive: Marvin webster.

20:11.377 --> 20:12.577
   He was here the same night

20:12.579 --> 20:14.812
   Wally came to ask
   smitty for more time.

20:14.814 --> 20:16.247
    And he followed him out
    when he left

20:16.249 --> 20:18.115
     And then murdered him.

20:18.117 --> 20:19.951
   Where do we go from here?

20:21.321 --> 20:22.386
       (knocking on door)

20:23.856 --> 20:25.223
             Yeah?

20:25.225 --> 20:27.592
 Mrs. Webster, we're with
 the seattle police department.

20:27.594 --> 20:29.460
     We're investigating
     your husband's death.

20:29.462 --> 20:31.329
  We have reason to believe
  the person who ran him over

20:31.331 --> 20:32.597
 Might've been someone he knew.

20:32.599 --> 20:33.864
 We're hoping
 you might let us look through

20:33.866 --> 20:35.199
       Your husband's
       personal effects.

20:35.702 --> 20:36.867
        It's about time.

20:38.871 --> 20:40.104
  If this were my home office,

20:40.106 --> 20:42.139
     My thoughts might turn
     to murder as well.

20:43.943 --> 20:46.644
      <i> 6,012 unusual facts,</i>

20:46.646 --> 20:49.614
  You and marvin
  would've had a couple things
  in common then.

20:49.616 --> 20:52.149
    Mrs. Webster
    was sure cool with us
    poking around down here.

20:52.151 --> 20:54.118
  Mrs. Webster doesn't mind us
  going through his stuff

20:54.120 --> 20:56.520
  Because she feels
  like he has nothing to hide.

20:56.522 --> 20:58.389
  She has no idea what he was.

20:58.391 --> 21:01.459
      Or he was just
      a mild-mannered
      pest control expert

21:01.461 --> 21:03.728
  And we're wasting our time.

21:03.730 --> 21:05.296
         Nothing here.

21:09.702 --> 21:11.168
     See if that lamp
     has a three-way bulb.

21:11.170 --> 21:12.870
    Maybe it gets brighter.

21:12.872 --> 21:14.071
         -(bulb breaks)
         -(sighs)

21:14.073 --> 21:15.940
          -Guess not.
          -Hold on.

21:20.079 --> 21:22.480
      -(tires screeching)
      -(marvin groans)

21:24.584 --> 21:26.217
        (marvin screaming)

21:28.154 --> 21:29.453
            (gasps)

21:37.430 --> 21:39.096
          Clive: Liv?

21:39.098 --> 21:40.631
     I saw the hit-and-run.

21:40.633 --> 21:41.999
 It was definitely intentional.

21:42.001 --> 21:44.669
    It hit him once
    and then backed over him
    to finish the job.

21:44.671 --> 21:47.438
  The car that ran over marvin
  was orange.

21:47.440 --> 21:48.939
 I caught the first few letters
 of the plate.

21:48.941 --> 21:51.509
    I've got something, too.

21:51.511 --> 21:53.678
     Look what marvin keeps
     in his tool chest.

21:54.847 --> 21:56.947
 It's glock, with a suppressor.

21:56.949 --> 21:59.283
   The gun
   that killed wally walker.

21:59.285 --> 22:01.185
 How do you feel about telling
 your lieutenant now?

22:09.996 --> 22:11.429
      The car had
      one long taillight,

22:11.431 --> 22:13.631
 But i'm starting to believe
 that there isn't such a thing.

22:13.633 --> 22:15.499
     With the color
     and the partial plate,

22:15.501 --> 22:18.469
     I've still got 79 cars
     that could've run over
         marvin webster.

22:18.471 --> 22:20.171
    Which is why i'm looking
    at pictures of cars

22:20.173 --> 22:22.340
  Just like they'll force me
  to do if i wind up in hell.

22:22.342 --> 22:23.407
             Hey...

22:24.410 --> 22:26.243
    How about doing a sketch
    of the taillight

22:26.245 --> 22:27.878
     And i'll run with it?

22:27.880 --> 22:29.246
  Kind of annoying that
  we didn't come up with that
  an hour ago,

22:29.248 --> 22:30.815
         But i'm on it.

22:31.718 --> 22:33.150
       Talk to you later.

22:34.187 --> 22:35.586
       You're home early.

22:35.588 --> 22:37.755
      Yeah, well,
      your detective buddy
      blew up my case,

22:37.757 --> 22:39.690
  So there wasn't much to do.

22:40.693 --> 22:42.026
  They released gus williams.

22:42.028 --> 22:43.661
     Well, he was innocent.

22:43.663 --> 22:45.629
   I have a pile of evidence
   that says otherwise.

22:45.631 --> 22:46.964
     Someone else
     had the murder weapon.

22:46.966 --> 22:49.433
 The gambling angle
 was never fully investigated.

22:50.403 --> 22:51.669
 You read my files, didn't you?

22:53.005 --> 22:54.171
     My confidential file.

22:54.173 --> 22:55.740
    You want me to feel bad?

22:55.742 --> 22:57.208
    You would've sent
    an innocent man to jail.

22:57.210 --> 22:59.510
   No. (stuttering) you've been
   a slug for months,

22:59.512 --> 23:01.045
 And this... This is the thing

23:01.047 --> 23:02.980
 That gets you off of your ass?

23:02.982 --> 23:04.882
        Not your family,
        not your fiance,

23:04.884 --> 23:06.016
       Proving me wrong!

23:06.018 --> 23:07.351
 It has nothing to do with you.

23:07.353 --> 23:09.687
     No, no, no,
     but it does! It does!

23:11.290 --> 23:12.690
            (scoffs)

23:12.692 --> 23:15.559
    I get that you had to do
    what you think is right,

23:15.561 --> 23:16.961
     But you could at least
     feel bad about it.

23:18.531 --> 23:20.197
       You just massively
       derailed my career

23:20.199 --> 23:21.532
    And you don't even care,
    do you?

23:23.803 --> 23:25.503
        Yeah, you don't.

23:28.074 --> 23:29.740
      These brains i'm on
      are the worst.

23:29.742 --> 23:31.242
       My closest friend
       in the world,

23:31.244 --> 23:33.744
     And i couldn't even
     muster up an apology.

23:33.746 --> 23:36.514
     I was such
     an unbelievable bitch

23:36.516 --> 23:38.082
     And i don't even care.

23:38.084 --> 23:39.850
 Well, you sound like you care.

23:39.852 --> 23:42.686
    Because i know i should,
    but i don't.

23:42.688 --> 23:45.556
    The whole world's
    behind 50 feet of glass.

23:45.558 --> 23:47.758
      You could always eat
      another brain.

23:53.966 --> 23:55.032
       Mrs. Marian evans,

23:55.034 --> 23:57.368
       Asphyxiation
       in a nursing home.

23:57.970 --> 23:59.036
             Sold.

23:59.038 --> 24:00.571
     But i feel duty-bound
     to remind you

24:00.573 --> 24:02.072
      About wally walker.

24:02.074 --> 24:04.208
    You eat her,
    no more marvin visions.

24:04.210 --> 24:06.844
   And whoever hired him
   to kill wally
   likely gets away with it.

24:06.846 --> 24:10.514
 See, i know you're right,
 and i'll rally, but, nothing.

24:12.151 --> 24:14.485
      These brains scare
      the hell out of me.

24:14.487 --> 24:16.187
    I'm afraid of the person
    that i'm becoming.

24:16.189 --> 24:17.955
    You're cognizant enough
    to worry.

24:17.957 --> 24:19.757
        To me that says
        you'll be okay.

24:19.759 --> 24:21.559
    And it's not just wally
    who needs you,

24:21.561 --> 24:24.328
  I wanna go to the tank
  tomorrow to check on marcy.

24:24.330 --> 24:26.297
   I'm working on a safe way
   to gather samples.

24:26.299 --> 24:28.132
  And then, we search
  for any sign of improvement.

24:28.134 --> 24:29.200
      And if there's none?

24:29.202 --> 24:30.601
    Oh. There's every chance
    there will be.

24:30.603 --> 24:32.570
      I'm just wondering
      what plan b is here.

24:33.806 --> 24:36.040
     Liv, i need your help.

24:36.042 --> 24:37.908
     Jerome and i
     have been upstairs
     for the past two hours

24:37.910 --> 24:41.779
 Getting a master class
 in being ignored by the cops.

24:41.781 --> 24:43.481
 I'm sorry i haven't responded
 to your text message,

24:43.483 --> 24:45.249
      -But things have...
      -It's fine.

24:47.153 --> 24:49.086
     Why do you need a cop?

24:49.522 --> 24:51.288
           Tell her.

24:51.290 --> 24:53.090
    My roommate
    took his skateboard out,

24:53.092 --> 24:55.392
      Said he was going
      to the park
      for a couple hours.

24:55.394 --> 24:56.994
    That was four days ago.

24:59.732 --> 25:01.732
      Major is a counselor
      at helton shelter,

25:01.734 --> 25:03.334
       A halfway house
       for teen runaways,

25:03.336 --> 25:04.869
     Delinquents, addicts.

25:04.871 --> 25:06.403
   Yeah, addicts are the key
   to a good party.

25:06.405 --> 25:08.706
  Jerome's roommate at helton,
  eddie cisco,

25:08.708 --> 25:10.274
   Disappeared four days ago.

25:10.276 --> 25:12.142
    He reported it to major
    and now they're here.

25:12.144 --> 25:13.744
    No, we're not just here.

25:13.746 --> 25:15.412
  We've been riding the police
  for the last three days

25:15.414 --> 25:16.514
      Who've done
      absolutely nothing.

25:16.516 --> 25:18.082
   Did you file
   a missing persons report?

25:18.084 --> 25:20.084
      Yes. There have been
      no follow-ups,

25:20.086 --> 25:21.352
     They didn't even call
     the hospitals.

25:21.354 --> 25:22.553
        I've got to ask,

25:22.555 --> 25:24.688
  Are you sure
  eddie didn't just take off?

25:24.690 --> 25:26.624
 He wouldn't be
 the first shelter kid to jet.

25:26.626 --> 25:27.758
   He was doing really well.

25:27.760 --> 25:29.693
       His ipod is still
       in its dock, okay?

25:29.695 --> 25:31.829
 If you knew eddie, you'd know
 he didn't plan on leaving.

25:31.831 --> 25:33.731
   Is there anything else
   about him to help me out?

25:33.733 --> 25:34.865
    Like, places he'd hang?

25:37.503 --> 25:39.036
       Eddie's a skater.

25:39.038 --> 25:41.739
  He'd go to nine trolls,
  this skate park near helton.

25:41.741 --> 25:43.574
      He started
      going less, though.

25:43.576 --> 25:45.676
      Some scary dude
      was hanging around.

25:45.678 --> 25:47.678
    Eddie said people
    called him the candyman

25:47.680 --> 25:50.681
   'cause he was
   passing out utopium
   like they was jelly beans.

25:50.683 --> 25:52.283
      If you were willing
      to follow him back

25:52.285 --> 25:54.618
   To his child molester van
   or whatever.

25:56.856 --> 25:59.056
 All right.
 I'm gonna walk this over
 to missing persons right now,

25:59.058 --> 26:00.424
    Get eddie
    to the top of the pile.

26:01.360 --> 26:03.193
          Nice kicks.

26:03.195 --> 26:05.262
 Section 8 of the flag code
 states that the american flag

26:05.264 --> 26:06.830
        Should never be
        used as apparel,

26:06.832 --> 26:08.465
      Although enforcement
      of the code

26:08.467 --> 26:11.569
     Conflicts with your
     first amendment right
     to freedom of speech

26:11.571 --> 26:14.371
 As laid out
 in the 1990 supreme court case

26:14.373 --> 26:16.006
   <i> United states v. Eichman.</i>

26:18.377 --> 26:20.210
     You didn't say
     you was marrying siri.

26:20.212 --> 26:21.879
      We should get going.

26:21.881 --> 26:23.581
  You really think you can do
  better than my boy here?

26:23.583 --> 26:25.082
            Jerome.

26:25.084 --> 26:26.684
      I'll see you around.

26:26.686 --> 26:28.886
     -Yeah.
     -I don't get it, man.

26:32.825 --> 26:34.224
 You may hate looking at cars,

26:34.226 --> 26:36.393
       But you're decent
       at drawing them.

26:37.063 --> 26:38.762
          1978 landau.

26:39.398 --> 26:40.698
      Note the taillights.

26:40.700 --> 26:42.666
  That got us down to one car.

26:42.668 --> 26:45.736
    I found it listed
    in the local car trader,
    and guess what?

26:45.738 --> 26:48.272
  The owner sold it the day
  before marvin was murdered.

26:48.274 --> 26:50.541
     Who did he sell it to?

26:50.543 --> 26:51.675
        That's our guy.

26:53.746 --> 26:55.179
  Are you sure it was my car?

26:57.149 --> 26:59.717
  I can't believe the guy
  i sold it to killed someone.

26:59.719 --> 27:02.486
  Any information
  you could give us about him
  would be helpful.

27:02.488 --> 27:04.421
   Well, that's the thing,
   he was very specific about

27:04.423 --> 27:05.723
 Not wanting to give his name.

27:05.725 --> 27:07.925
   He wore sunglasses, a hat.

27:07.927 --> 27:09.927
       He paid well over
       what i was asking.

27:09.929 --> 27:13.831
 The funny thing was,
 i already recognized the guy.

27:13.833 --> 27:15.766
   The guy's been
   all over the news lately.

27:15.768 --> 27:17.434
   There was another picture
   of him in the paper

27:17.436 --> 27:18.902
       A couple days ago.

27:18.904 --> 27:20.671
     I brought it with me.

27:23.976 --> 27:25.309
        Clive: This guy?

27:25.311 --> 27:26.477
    The guy
    who collected the reward

27:26.479 --> 27:27.611
  For turning in gus williams?

27:27.613 --> 27:29.213
          No, not him.

27:29.215 --> 27:30.547
        -Him.
        -Liv: Don watts?

27:30.549 --> 27:32.449
     That's wally walker's
     angel investor.

27:32.451 --> 27:34.385
     He offered the reward.

27:35.588 --> 27:36.687
      The car is probably
      at the bottom

27:36.689 --> 27:37.788
       Of a lake by now.

27:37.790 --> 27:39.356
       The car still has
       lojack on it.

27:40.259 --> 27:41.325
        Does that help?

27:52.538 --> 27:54.571
     Seattle suit factory,
     am i right?

27:54.573 --> 27:56.306
    Ever been to luly yang
    in the fairmont olympic?

27:56.308 --> 27:57.541
 She does women's high fashion,

27:57.543 --> 27:58.642
    But she'll make
    an exception as a favor.

27:58.644 --> 27:59.977
      I could make a call.

27:59.979 --> 28:02.546
   Let's talk cars, instead.
   Yours.

28:02.548 --> 28:04.381
 I have lots of 'em. Which one
 you wanna talk about?

28:04.383 --> 28:06.884
       Your 1978 landau.

28:06.886 --> 28:09.386
     '78 landau?
     Doesn't sound like me.

28:09.388 --> 28:11.422
      We caught a teenager
      joyriding in it.

28:11.424 --> 28:13.123
     He claimed he found it
     with the windows down

28:13.125 --> 28:14.858
 And the keys in the ignition.

28:14.860 --> 28:15.959
    It had marvin webster's

28:15.961 --> 28:17.361
         Blood and hair
         on the bumper.

28:17.363 --> 28:18.962
     Who's marvin webster?

28:19.999 --> 28:22.299
   Clive: A contract killer.

28:22.301 --> 28:25.769
     We believe he murdered
     your business partner,
          wally walker.

28:25.771 --> 28:29.339
 We know that this was the car
 that ran marvin webster over.

28:29.341 --> 28:31.375
   And we know that
   you paid cash for this car

28:31.377 --> 28:32.943
   The day before the murder.

28:32.945 --> 28:36.313
  The man who sold it to you,
  one patrick edward,

28:36.315 --> 28:38.849
       Saw your picture
       in the newspaper.

28:38.851 --> 28:41.118
  And your dna is in the car.

28:41.120 --> 28:42.586
      Liv: Hair follicles.

28:42.588 --> 28:44.088
     You gotta watch those.

28:44.090 --> 28:46.256
      Oh, that '78 landau.

28:46.258 --> 28:48.525
    My client appeared here
    as a courtesy.

28:48.527 --> 28:50.294
      If you had anything
      to charge him with,

28:50.296 --> 28:52.329
  You'd do it. Let's go, don.

28:52.331 --> 28:55.866
      I don't know. I...
      I kind of wanna hear
      how this story ends.

28:55.868 --> 28:57.835
    Wally walker
    was a genius programmer,

28:57.837 --> 29:00.471
  But his gambling debts
  were gonna sink the company.

29:00.473 --> 29:02.506
    He needed fast cash
    so he was gonna sell out

29:02.508 --> 29:03.574
     To the boys in redmond

29:03.576 --> 29:04.842
        Rather than wait
        and go public,

29:04.844 --> 29:06.510
        Like you wanted.

29:07.313 --> 29:09.780
  You took care of the problem

29:09.782 --> 29:12.783
   And made tens of millions
   of dollars in the process.

29:12.785 --> 29:15.185
     I do remember
     the tens of millions.

29:15.187 --> 29:16.587
        After marvin did
        your dirty work,

29:16.589 --> 29:18.422
     You decided to tie up
     the loose ends.

29:20.326 --> 29:21.992
    Cell phone records show
    you were called

29:21.994 --> 29:23.494
  From a disposable cell phone

29:23.496 --> 29:26.497
  45 minutes before
  marvin webster was run over.

29:27.199 --> 29:28.499
   What was that call about?

29:28.501 --> 29:30.734
       How would i know?

29:30.736 --> 29:32.603
     I'm sorry, did you say
     you found this
     disposable phone

29:32.605 --> 29:34.037
        On this hit man?

29:35.374 --> 29:36.940
        No, i guess not.

29:36.942 --> 29:39.042
     (sighs) but let's say
     i did hit someone.

29:39.044 --> 29:40.544
      -Don...
      -I got this, harry.

29:40.546 --> 29:42.513
     Yeah. Shut up, harry.

29:42.515 --> 29:43.747
      I bought that landau
      to restore.

29:43.749 --> 29:45.115
   It's a classic, you know.

29:45.117 --> 29:46.650
        The '78 landau.

29:46.652 --> 29:48.919
     But maybe i did hit
     something that night.

29:48.921 --> 29:50.854
  Maybe i hoped it was a deer,
  but i wasn't sure.

29:50.856 --> 29:52.022
        Maybe i wasn't
        thinking clearly

29:52.024 --> 29:53.524
      And just walked away
      from the car.

29:53.526 --> 29:55.225
    But this
    marvin webster business?

29:55.227 --> 29:56.894
    Never met the man.
    Good luck proving that.

29:56.896 --> 29:58.362
      We'll be placing you
      under arrest

29:58.364 --> 30:00.197
  For vehicular manslaughter.

30:00.199 --> 30:02.599
       You said he was
       a murderer, right?

30:02.601 --> 30:04.735
     Did you know
     that i'm on the cover
     of <i> ranier magazine?</i>

30:04.737 --> 30:06.804
      I have a copy of it
      on my desk.

30:06.806 --> 30:07.971
     I was hoping
     to get you to sign it

30:07.973 --> 30:10.474
    Before we send you down
    to walla walla.

30:10.476 --> 30:12.476
      If i did run over
      this marvin webster,

30:13.345 --> 30:14.545
   It's just another example

30:14.547 --> 30:15.779
      Of my tireless work

30:15.781 --> 30:17.214
     On behalf of the good
     people of seattle.

30:18.484 --> 30:20.517
     This arrest may get me
     elected mayor.

30:21.987 --> 30:23.487
      How many days
      do you really think

30:23.489 --> 30:25.522
    I'll spend behind bars?

30:25.524 --> 30:26.957
           Be honest.

30:27.760 --> 30:29.092
     I'll give you a hint.

30:29.094 --> 30:30.494
      It's a round number.

30:30.496 --> 30:33.130
     I'll have you out
     within the hour, don.

30:36.202 --> 30:37.668
 Liv: <i> Is he really gonna walk?</i>

30:37.670 --> 30:41.138
 If we can't prove a connection
 between him and webster, yeah.

30:41.774 --> 30:43.640
             Wait.

30:43.642 --> 30:46.743
 I have an idea
 how we can put them together.

30:46.745 --> 30:48.912
    Get your vision cap on.

30:48.914 --> 30:51.415
   You have no right
   to be in my husband's car!

30:51.417 --> 30:53.951
   You know what you can do
   with this impound notice?

30:53.953 --> 30:55.853
   My husband was a good man!

30:55.855 --> 30:57.654
   And you've made him
   into some kind of monster!

30:57.656 --> 30:59.122
         She's lovely.

30:59.124 --> 31:00.657
       Here goes nothing.

31:00.659 --> 31:02.159
         (engine revs)

31:02.962 --> 31:04.661
           All right.

31:04.663 --> 31:06.396
       "my destinations."

31:06.398 --> 31:07.898
  The last place marvin drove

31:07.900 --> 31:10.267
 Should be where he was killed.

31:10.269 --> 31:12.536
   That's where it happened.
   It's a match.

31:12.538 --> 31:15.005
   All right. So here's
   where he was before that.

31:15.007 --> 31:16.240
      Professional hit men
      don't do business

31:16.242 --> 31:17.541
        Over the phone.

31:17.543 --> 31:19.476
     If he set up a meeting
     after the first call,

31:19.478 --> 31:20.644
   It could be any of these.

31:20.646 --> 31:21.745
     Let's check them out.

31:24.850 --> 31:26.116
       Liv: <i> The last thing</i>
      <i> i wanna do is</i>

31:26.118 --> 31:27.951
    <i> Have another flood</i>
    <i> of psychopathic thoughts</i>

31:27.953 --> 31:29.586
  <i> Bringing out my inner bitch.</i>

31:29.588 --> 31:32.356
  <i> But when popeye faces bluto,</i>

  <i> Then let's pop the top</i>

31:40.966 --> 31:42.065
      Lots of dog owners,

31:42.067 --> 31:44.534
      But so far no one
      who saw don, marvin

31:44.536 --> 31:46.470
    Or his bug whack mobile.

31:46.472 --> 31:48.138
      How's it going here,
      any good vibrations?

31:48.140 --> 31:49.373
            Not yet.

31:49.375 --> 31:51.441
 Uh, keep at it.
 I'm gonna keep asking around.

31:51.443 --> 31:53.210
      Somebody might have
      seen these guys.

31:56.815 --> 31:58.048
           Excuse me.

31:58.050 --> 31:59.616
     (jovial music playing
     on ice cream truck)

32:06.425 --> 32:07.824
     (jovial music playing)

32:07.826 --> 32:11.094
 You gave me a price, i met it.
 We're paid up.

32:11.096 --> 32:13.530
 Marvin: Anybody gonna miss you
 when you're gone, son?

32:13.532 --> 32:14.965
           (knocking)

32:14.967 --> 32:16.566
 Sanitation worker: Gentlemen,
 can you take this elsewhere?

32:16.568 --> 32:18.001
    Truck's coming through.

32:18.704 --> 32:20.003
            (gasps)

32:22.541 --> 32:23.774
             Clive!

32:25.711 --> 32:28.178
      There was a witness,
      a garbage man.

32:28.180 --> 32:30.647
    I couldn't see his face,
    but if we can find him,

32:30.649 --> 32:32.683
  We can prove that watts met
  with the exterminator.

32:32.685 --> 32:34.418
   All right. I'll track down
   the sanitation crew

32:34.420 --> 32:36.720
 That worked this street
 that day. You free to join me?

32:36.722 --> 32:37.988
            I can't.

32:37.990 --> 32:39.890
  I promised ravi i'd help him
  with some research.

32:39.892 --> 32:41.291
     And no rest
     for the wicked, right?

32:44.797 --> 32:47.698
     Liv: <i> I'm cold,</i>
    <i> all the way through me.</i>

32:47.700 --> 32:50.133
     <i> And the closer</i>
     <i> we get to marcy,</i>
     <i> the frostier i become.</i>

32:50.135 --> 32:52.369
    She may well be better.
    (panting)

32:52.371 --> 32:54.271
     You always feel better
     after a good brain.

32:54.273 --> 32:57.374
    Liv: <i> I can see ravi's hope</i>
   <i> for what it is, fear.</i>

32:57.376 --> 32:58.442
       <i> He can't deal</i>
       <i> with what it means</i>

32:58.444 --> 33:00.043
   <i> If marcy hasn't improved,</i>

33:00.045 --> 33:01.244
     <i> What we'll have to do.</i>

33:01.246 --> 33:04.014
       <i> -But i can.</i>
        -Maybe she's fine.

33:04.016 --> 33:06.316
 <i> Because marvin was a hit man.</i>

33:06.318 --> 33:09.987
    <i> And i can't help feeling</i>
    <i> that's what this</i>
    <i> chilly emptiness is.</i>

33:09.989 --> 33:11.989
    <i> This is how marvin felt</i>
    <i> before a kill.</i>

33:16.028 --> 33:18.328
         -Ravi: Marcy?
         -(grunting)

33:18.330 --> 33:19.596
    I'm here with liv moore.

33:19.598 --> 33:21.665
   (stuttering) she worked at
   the hospital with you.

33:21.667 --> 33:23.600
   You were a resident there.

33:23.969 --> 33:25.736
             Marcy?

33:25.738 --> 33:27.004
      Liv: It didn't work.

33:27.006 --> 33:28.905
      Well, we have
      to keep trying to...

33:28.907 --> 33:30.340
           (grunting)

33:30.976 --> 33:32.709
      We have to kill it.

33:33.912 --> 33:35.979
      Her. She's a person.

33:36.849 --> 33:38.181
       She's a time bomb.

33:38.183 --> 33:39.649
  What if she'd scratched
  that kid who took the photo?

33:39.651 --> 33:41.718
    What if someone stumbled
    in here and fell in?

33:41.720 --> 33:43.954
 What if someone lets her out?

33:43.956 --> 33:45.255
      We'll transport her.

33:45.257 --> 33:47.424
     To where, the morgue?

33:47.426 --> 33:48.792
     The morgue
     at the police station?

33:48.794 --> 33:50.961
    You are talking
    about killing somebody.

33:50.963 --> 33:52.229
     What if that were you
     down there?

33:52.231 --> 33:54.731
 I'd hope someone would put me
 out of my misery.

33:54.733 --> 33:56.166
        This isn't you!

33:56.168 --> 33:58.268
       This is that sicko
       in your head!

33:58.270 --> 34:00.704
     Do you remember
     your hippocratic oath?

34:00.706 --> 34:03.640
  "i will prescribe regimens
  for the good of my patients

34:03.642 --> 34:05.942
    "according to my ability
    and my judgment

34:05.944 --> 34:07.778
 "and never do harm to anyone."

34:07.780 --> 34:10.179
 You're a doctor. You should...
 (stutters)
 where are you going?

34:10.181 --> 34:11.815
  I'm looking for a big rock.

34:11.817 --> 34:14.851
  Liv, come on.
  (stuttering)
  just let me do this biopsy.

34:16.255 --> 34:17.320
           Come on...

34:18.524 --> 34:19.856
            (grunts)

34:23.262 --> 34:24.327
            (growls)

34:25.964 --> 34:27.030
           (screams)

34:29.168 --> 34:30.400
           Ravi: Liv?

34:30.402 --> 34:31.668
   -A little help? (gasping)
   -(growls)

34:32.371 --> 34:34.137
           Liv! Liv!

34:34.139 --> 34:35.371
      Throw me the pipe!

34:38.409 --> 34:40.010
     Liv, it's the brains!
     They're making you...

34:43.181 --> 34:44.347
         (ravi screams)

34:47.786 --> 34:48.985
              Liv!

34:48.987 --> 34:50.187
              Liv!

34:52.824 --> 34:53.924
            (yells)

34:55.159 --> 34:56.426
           -(growls)
           -(gasps)

34:57.863 --> 34:59.062
           (choking)

35:03.102 --> 35:04.334
            -(yelps)
            -(growls)

35:10.943 --> 35:12.309
           (panting)

35:17.616 --> 35:18.715
       You're all right.

35:22.454 --> 35:23.620
       You're all right.

35:26.058 --> 35:27.624
       You're all right.

35:33.499 --> 35:36.032
 -You can get your sample now.
 -(panting)

35:49.748 --> 35:50.981
   Ravi: All right.
   We'll have to burn it all.

35:50.983 --> 35:53.049
       The blood could be
       a contaminant.

35:53.051 --> 35:54.551
     I almost let you die.

35:54.553 --> 35:56.119
     Yeah, but you didn't.

35:59.691 --> 36:00.790
             Liv...

36:01.193 --> 36:02.626
           I'm fine.

36:02.628 --> 36:04.528
         You saved me.

36:04.530 --> 36:06.930
  All that sociopath swimming
  through your system,

36:06.932 --> 36:09.166
      And you still found
      your way through.

36:09.168 --> 36:10.901
         This brain...

36:10.903 --> 36:11.968
     It's not who you are.

36:14.373 --> 36:15.539
     (cell phone vibrates)

36:18.744 --> 36:20.510
          It's clive.

36:20.512 --> 36:22.078
       He needs us both.

36:23.248 --> 36:25.615
      Okay, i'm back.
      I'm recording this.

36:25.617 --> 36:28.351
 I wanna have a record
 of your ridiculous allegations

36:28.353 --> 36:30.187
 When i sue you for harassment.

36:30.189 --> 36:32.022
          Fair enough.

36:32.024 --> 36:33.623
     You wanted to get rid
     of wally walker

36:33.625 --> 36:35.759
  So you hired
  marvin webster to kill him.

36:35.761 --> 36:36.960
        And defamation.

36:36.962 --> 36:38.695
      Clive: Wally's death
      made you a fortune.

36:38.697 --> 36:40.730
   Marvin likely figured out
   how much you were worth,

36:40.732 --> 36:42.365
      Got greedy,
      demanded more money.

36:42.367 --> 36:44.401
     So you killed him,
     tied up the loose end.

36:44.403 --> 36:47.170
   Who is this marvin webster
   you keep talking about?

36:47.172 --> 36:49.039
  The dead man who called you
  on two occasions

36:49.041 --> 36:51.208
  Just before you ran him over
  in your newly purchased

36:51.210 --> 36:53.109
          1978 landau.

36:53.111 --> 36:55.712
    From a disposable phone
    that you don't have.

36:55.714 --> 36:57.147
      That's some
      weak tea, detective.

36:58.150 --> 37:00.250
      You might be right.

37:00.252 --> 37:01.851
  And i'll need things,
  like the address

37:01.853 --> 37:03.086
   Where you and marvin met.

37:03.088 --> 37:04.521
     Stone trail dog park.

37:04.523 --> 37:06.489
    The kind of car you were
    driving at that meeting.

37:06.491 --> 37:08.925
   Silver, luxury, electric.

37:08.927 --> 37:10.093
   Might even help if i knew

37:10.095 --> 37:11.995
   You were wearing
   a blue button-down shirt.

37:11.997 --> 37:13.330
     Seems pretty specific.

37:13.332 --> 37:14.431
             It is.

37:16.301 --> 37:20.170
   But probably the most
   helpful bit of information

37:20.172 --> 37:22.339
     Is the conversation
     our witness overheard.

37:24.776 --> 37:26.676
         What witness?

37:26.678 --> 37:28.645
     The witness who picked
     both you and marvin

37:28.647 --> 37:29.980
     Out of a photo lineup.

37:31.283 --> 37:32.649
  From the witness' statement,

37:32.651 --> 37:35.552
   "you gave me a price,
   i met it. We're paid up."

37:36.421 --> 37:37.487
          (door opens)

37:37.990 --> 37:39.623
           He's here.

37:39.625 --> 37:41.124
           Thank you.

37:41.126 --> 37:42.225
      Do something, harry.

37:42.227 --> 37:43.727
      Let's walk out, don.

37:43.729 --> 37:47.163
 Don't you wanna stay and hear
 how this story ends, don?

37:47.165 --> 37:49.466
 It was garbage day, remember?

38:07.352 --> 38:10.387
  Peyton charles,
  assistant district attorney

38:10.389 --> 38:13.790
 I'm authorized to offer you
 this one-time only plea deal.

38:13.792 --> 38:15.258
       Thirty years
       for each homicide,

38:15.260 --> 38:17.327
     But you'll serve them
     concurrently.

38:17.329 --> 38:18.395
   Get up and walk out, don.

38:18.964 --> 38:21.931
         One-time only.

38:21.933 --> 38:24.801
 With good behavior,
 you could still have some
 quality years on the outside.

38:24.803 --> 38:27.237
    But if you walk out
    of this room right now,

38:27.239 --> 38:30.407
   I promise you will never
   draw another free breath.

38:32.878 --> 38:34.711
      The story ends, don,

38:37.149 --> 38:38.882
        With you signing
        that confession.

38:47.926 --> 38:49.225
            (sighs)

39:15.454 --> 39:17.554
      I have to say,
      this is surprising.

39:17.556 --> 39:18.788
       I never knew
       orange safety gear

39:18.790 --> 39:19.856
    Would be so flattering.

39:19.858 --> 39:21.324
   I look positively rugged.

39:21.326 --> 39:22.959
  You were totally convincing.

39:22.961 --> 39:24.961
      You held that
      coffee cup with real

39:24.963 --> 39:26.596
     Blue-collar machismo.

39:26.598 --> 39:27.897
   Now, that was thrilling.

39:27.899 --> 39:29.399
     I'm almost glad
     the sanitation officer

39:29.401 --> 39:31.334
  Couldn't remember anything.

39:31.336 --> 39:32.969
    So, how are you feeling?

39:33.739 --> 39:35.372
  The brains are wearing off.

39:35.374 --> 39:36.906
      I'm starting to feel
      like my old self.

39:36.908 --> 39:38.007
          That's good.

39:39.010 --> 39:40.844
        I'm not so sure.

39:40.846 --> 39:42.712
 Liv: <i> Marvin webster's brains,</i>

39:42.714 --> 39:44.214
    <i> The worst i've ever had.</i>

39:44.216 --> 39:45.749
<i> I've been a zombie for months,</i>

39:45.751 --> 39:48.318
      <i> But i never felt</i>
      <i> like a monster</i>
      <i> until i ate marvin.</i>

39:48.320 --> 39:50.653
    <i> But now that he's almost</i>
    <i> out of my system,</i>

39:50.655 --> 39:52.555
<i> I'm desperate for another hit.</i>

39:52.557 --> 39:56.593
  <i> Because when marvin's gone,</i>
  <i> my feelings come back.</i>

39:56.595 --> 39:58.194
   <i> And after</i>
   <i> what happened to marcy...</i>

39:58.196 --> 40:00.430
   <i> After what i did to marcy,</i>

40:00.432 --> 40:02.932
  <i> Do i really wanna feel that?</i>

40:02.934 --> 40:05.568
     <i> One bite will make it</i>
     <i> all just float away.</i>

40:06.705 --> 40:08.538
      (breathing heavily)

40:12.944 --> 40:14.277
  (garbage disposal churning)

40:19.351 --> 40:22.051
<i> But i can't let it float away.</i>

40:22.053 --> 40:23.686
      <i> Whatever i feel,</i>
      <i> won't be a fraction</i>

40:23.688 --> 40:26.523
   <i> Of what marcy went through</i>
   <i> alone in the dark.</i>

40:29.561 --> 40:30.760
        <i> Marcy was real.</i>

40:32.030 --> 40:34.197
         <i> She was alive.</i>

40:34.199 --> 40:35.632
       <i> She was a person.</i>

40:35.634 --> 40:38.067
          Oh. (gasps)

40:38.069 --> 40:39.702
     Liv: <i> And i killed her.</i>

40:44.876 --> 40:46.409
      (indistinct talking)

40:48.313 --> 40:50.313
     <i> That's the thing</i>
     <i> about pain, isn't it?</i>

41:03.428 --> 41:06.896
     <i> Really feeling it</i>
     <i> doesn't make it stop.</i>

41:06.898 --> 41:09.265
      <i> It just shows you</i>
      <i> you're still alive.</i>

41:12.404 --> 41:14.938
   Jerome: Hey, have you guys
   seen my friend?

41:14.940 --> 41:16.206
              -No.
              -No?

41:16.208 --> 41:17.440
             Sorry.

41:18.977 --> 41:20.076
        (woman laughing)

41:20.078 --> 41:21.778
        -Hey, have you...
        -No.

41:25.016 --> 41:27.450
     Hey, uh, have you guys
     seen my friend?

41:27.452 --> 41:29.018
        Don't think so.

41:32.524 --> 41:35.191
    Hey, uh,
    have you seen my friend?

41:36.561 --> 41:38.361
    Brother, i just saw him.

41:38.363 --> 41:40.263
  -(stutters) are you serious?
  -Yeah.

41:40.265 --> 41:41.431
     Where is he?
     (stutters) is he okay?

41:41.433 --> 41:43.700
     Whoa, whoa, easy.
     (stutters) he's fine.

41:43.702 --> 41:45.768
    He's at a house party
    a few blocks from here.

41:45.770 --> 41:47.403
      -I'll walk you over,
      if you like.
      -(sighs) yeah.

41:47.405 --> 41:48.605
             -Yeah?
             -Yeah.

41:48.607 --> 41:51.074
   -Is anyone waiting on you?
   -No, it's just me.

41:51.076 --> 41:52.475
       We'll have you
       to him in no time.

41:52.477 --> 41:53.743
           Thank you.
