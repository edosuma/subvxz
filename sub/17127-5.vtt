10:43.343 --> 10:46.346
"ANOTHER LUMP OF SUGAR,
 MR. GARVEY?"

10:48.679 --> 10:51.221
DAD SAID I GOTTA PRACTICE FOR
 TOMORROW´S GAME.

10:51.221 --> 10:53.684
I THOUGHT HIS LUCKY BALL
 MIGHT HELP ME GET A HIT.

10:53.684 --> 10:55.726
YOU BETTER PLAY
 WITH ANOTHER BALL.

10:55.726 --> 10:58.228
I DON´T HAVE ANOTHER BALL.
 I LOST THEM ON THE ROOF.

10:59.359 --> 11:02.993
CAN YOU CLIMB UP ON THE ROOF
 AND GET ME ONE DOWN?

11:04.695 --> 11:07.297
WHY, WHEN YOU HAVE A PERFECTLY
 GOOD ONE RIGHT HERE?

11:07.297 --> 11:09.069
COME ON, LET´S GO.
 LET´S GO.

11:09.069 --> 11:10.801
LET´S TRY IT, MAX.
 HERE WE GO.

11:13.003 --> 11:14.674
OH-HO!

11:14.674 --> 11:17.007
HEY, I GOT A HIT!
 IT REALLY IS A LUCKY BALL.

11:17.007 --> 11:20.110
GIVE IT UP, MR. NEEDLES.

11:20.110 --> 11:21.882
[ GROWLS AND BARKS ]

11:21.882 --> 11:23.854
MR. NEEDLES?

11:25.756 --> 11:27.117
NO, DON´T CHEW IT!

11:27.117 --> 11:28.789
DON´T, MAX! NO!

11:28.789 --> 11:33.123
DON´T EVER TRY TO TAKE SOMETHING
 OUT OF A DOG´S MOUTH!

11:33.123 --> 11:34.725
YOU SEE THIS SCAR?

11:34.725 --> 11:36.867
THIS IS WHAT MY MOM
 DID TO ME

11:36.867 --> 11:41.071
WHEN I´D TRY TO TAKE SOMETHING
 OUT OF A DOG´S MOUTH.

11:42.803 --> 11:46.737
MR. NEEDLES, COME ON.
 THAT´S DAD´S BALL.

11:46.737 --> 11:48.138
HE´S GONNA KILL ME.

11:48.138 --> 11:51.912
IT´S GONNA BE A SAD TEA
 PARTY TONIGHT.

11:54.714 --> 11:56.847
HURRY UP, GRANDMA.

11:56.847 --> 11:58.789
I KNOW THERE´S AT LEAST
 ONE BASEBALL UP THERE.

11:58.789 --> 12:00.290
DAD´S GONNA BE HOME ANY
 MINUTE!

12:00.290 --> 12:04.024
OH GOD, IT´S LIKE A FRISBEE
 GRAVEYARD UP HERE!

12:04.024 --> 12:05.095
UH-OH.

12:05.095 --> 12:06.897
DID YOU GET IT?

12:06.897 --> 12:12.933
UH, MAX, DID YOU EVER FIND THAT
 LITTLE GERBIL THAT RAN AWAY?

12:12.933 --> 12:14.234
NO. WHY?

12:14.234 --> 12:16.066
NO REASON.

12:18.138 --> 12:21.772
FREEDOM´S NOT SO SWEET,
 IS IT, MR. NIBBLES?

12:21.772 --> 12:23.743
HURRY UP, GRANDMA!

12:23.743 --> 12:25.345
OH, HEY! HEY!

12:25.345 --> 12:27.417
I GOT ONE!
 [ LAUGHS ]

12:27.417 --> 12:30.220
I GOT DAD´S BALL BACK...
 SORT OF.

12:30.220 --> 12:33.854
ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS COPY THE
 AUTOGRAPHS ONTO THE NEW BALL.

12:33.854 --> 12:36.526
CARMEN, YOU FORGE THE BEST.
 YOU DO IT.

12:40.861 --> 12:43.033
HEY, YOU´RE PRETTY GOOD
 AT THIS.

12:43.033 --> 12:46.937
HEY, DID GEORGE CLOONEY REALLY
 SIGN THAT McDONALD´S NAPKIN

12:46.937 --> 12:48.969
YOU GAVE ME FOR MY
 BIRTHDAY?

12:48.969 --> 12:50.340
YES.

12:50.340 --> 12:54.074
AND I CAN GET A NOTE FROM
 BRAD PITT SAYING HE DID.

12:56.106 --> 12:57.347
I HEAR A CAR.

12:57.347 --> 12:59.079
HERE!
 GO! GO! GO!

13:02.953 --> 13:05.085
MAX, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

13:05.085 --> 13:06.216
NOTHING.

13:06.216 --> 13:08.488
IS THAT MY AUTOGRAPHED
 BASEBALL?

13:08.488 --> 13:10.120
I WAS JUST LOOKING
 AT IT.

13:10.120 --> 13:12.993
MAX, YOU KNOW YOU´RE NOT
 SUPPOSED TO TOUCH IT.

13:12.993 --> 13:15.495
THIS BASEBALL´S VERY
 IMPORTANT TO ME.

13:15.495 --> 13:17.567
IT WAS SIGNED BY
 STEVE GRAVY.

13:21.371 --> 13:22.833
IT´S GARVEY.

13:22.833 --> 13:25.005
IN CARMEN´S HANDWRITING,
 IT SAYS "GRAVY."

13:25.005 --> 13:26.937
OKAY,
 WHERE´S MY BASEBALL?

13:26.937 --> 13:30.410
DAD, DID I TELL YOU I GOT
 AN "A" ON MY SPELLING TEST?

13:30.410 --> 13:33.483
HEY, CONGRATULATIONS.
 WHERE´S MY BASEBALL?

13:39.489 --> 13:41.091
OH, NO.

13:41.091 --> 13:42.592
IT´S OKAY, GEORGE.

13:42.592 --> 13:45.225
YOU CAN STILL READ ALL THE NAMES
 THROUGH THE SALIVA --

13:45.225 --> 13:47.998
OOH, THERE´S A TOOTH.

13:47.998 --> 13:49.459
I WAS PRACTICING LIKE
 YOU SAID,

13:49.459 --> 13:52.232
AND MR. NEEDLES GOT IT AND
 WOULDN´T GIVE IT BACK.

13:52.232 --> 13:54.134
I´M SORRY, DAD.
 I´M REALLY SORRY.

13:54.134 --> 13:56.366
MAX, I DON´T WANT TO HEAR IT.
 JUST GO TO YOUR ROOM.

13:56.366 --> 13:59.569
YOU SAID I HAD TO GET A HIT.
 I DIDN´T WANT TO DISAPPOINT YOU.

13:59.569 --> 14:02.512
MAX, I CAN´T EVEN TALK TO YOU.
 JUST GO TO YOUR ROOM.

14:07.377 --> 14:09.379
GEORGE,
 IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

14:09.379 --> 14:11.281
I DON´T CARE HOW IT
 HAPPENED.

14:11.281 --> 14:14.224
HE KNOWS HOW IMPORTANT THAT
 BASEBALL IS TO ME.

14:14.224 --> 14:16.386
HONEY, WE CAN GET YOU
 ANOTHER BASEBALL,

14:16.386 --> 14:18.858
BUT YOU GOTTA KNOW THE ONLY
 REASON HE TOOK IT

14:18.858 --> 14:21.531
WAS BECAUSE YOU´RE BEING SO HARD
 ON HIM TO PRACTICE.

14:21.531 --> 14:24.534
HE SHOULD BE GRATEFUL THAT HE
 HAS A DAD TO PUSH HIM.

14:24.534 --> 14:27.437
I SPENT HOURS ALONE THROWING A
 BALL AGAINST A GARAGE DOOR.

14:27.437 --> 14:30.240
NOBODY CARED IF I WAS GOOD.
 AT LEAST I´M THERE FOR HIM.

14:30.240 --> 14:31.942
IS THAT WHAT THIS
 IS ABOUT?

14:31.942 --> 14:34.574
YOU TRYING TO MAKE UP FOR WHAT
 YOUR DAD DIDN´T DO FOR YOU?

14:34.574 --> 14:36.176
IN A WAY, YEAH.

14:36.176 --> 14:39.179
THE FIRST TIME I HIT A HOME RUN,
 IT FELT SO GREAT

14:39.179 --> 14:41.281
UNTIL I LOOKED UP
 IN THE STANDS

14:41.281 --> 14:44.014
AND REALIZED THERE WAS NOBODY
 THERE FOR ME,

14:44.014 --> 14:48.058
AND WHEN I GOT TO HOME PLATE,
 THE COACH SAID, "THAT´S MY BOY."

14:48.058 --> 14:49.289
AND I CRIED.

14:49.289 --> 14:51.221
AND THEN WHEN I GOT TO THE
 DUGOUT,

14:51.221 --> 14:52.993
THE OTHER TEAM´S
 COACH SAID,

14:52.993 --> 14:55.065
"YOU´RE IN THE WRONG
 DUGOUT, SON."

14:57.928 --> 15:00.400
THEN I CRIED SOME MORE.

15:02.572 --> 15:06.276
ALL I´M SAYING IS IT HURTS
 NOT TO HAVE A FATHER.

15:06.276 --> 15:09.309
IT ALSO HURTS TO DISAPPOINT
 YOUR FATHER.

15:26.226 --> 15:28.528
HEY, LOPEZ!
 LOOK ALIVE!

15:28.528 --> 15:30.530
WHO SAID THAT?

15:30.530 --> 15:32.402
I DID.

15:35.365 --> 15:38.038
COME HERE.
 WE WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

15:38.038 --> 15:42.042
MAN...
 YOU GUYS CAN TALK?

15:42.042 --> 15:45.215
JOE? ROD?

15:45.215 --> 15:48.478
STEVE? JIM?

15:48.478 --> 15:50.981
I HAVEN´T SEEN YOU GUYS SINCE
 YOU SIGNED MY BALL!

15:50.981 --> 15:52.422
REMEMBER THAT DAY?

15:52.422 --> 15:55.585
YEAH, SURE. YOU WERE THE KID
 WITH THE PEN AND THE BALL.

15:55.585 --> 15:59.959
WISH I COULD HIGH-FIVE
 RIGHT NOW.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.361
YOU KNOW, GEORGE,

16:01.361 --> 16:03.493
YOU´RE GOING A LITTLE NUTS
 OVER THIS BALL THING.

16:03.493 --> 16:07.297
ANGIE´S RIGHT, GEORGE.
 YOU´RE PUSHING MAX WAY TOO HARD.

16:07.297 --> 16:08.468
IT´S YOUR OWN FAULT.

16:08.468 --> 16:10.440
HEY, I GET THAT FROM
 MY WIFE, MAN.

16:10.440 --> 16:12.972
I DON´T NEED IT FROM MY
 BOBBLE HEADS.

16:12.972 --> 16:15.405
OKAY.

16:15.405 --> 16:17.477
EVEN IF I DID PUSH HIM
 TOO HARD,

16:17.477 --> 16:19.379
THAT´S WHAT A DAD´S
 SUPPOSED TO DO.

16:19.379 --> 16:21.711
OTHERWISE, HE´LL NEVER BE
 A GOOD PLAYER.

16:21.711 --> 16:23.183
WEREN´T YOU GUYS PUSHED?

16:23.183 --> 16:25.455
YEAH, BUT WE REALLY LOVED
 THE GAME.

16:25.455 --> 16:27.187
DOES MAX EVEN LIKE
 BASEBALL?

16:27.187 --> 16:28.988
SURE HE DOES!

16:28.988 --> 16:34.124
WELL, HE LIKES BAKING BROWNIES
 IN THE SHAPE OF BASEBALLS.

16:34.124 --> 16:35.725
HEY,
 THAT´S HOW I STARTED.

16:40.430 --> 16:43.533
I´VE BEEN IN A LOT OF DREAMS,
 GEORGE --

16:43.533 --> 16:45.705
YOURS, BENNY´S...
 ANGIE´S.

16:47.637 --> 16:50.009
BUT I´VE NEVER BEEN
 IN MAX´S.

16:50.009 --> 16:54.344
WE TALKED TO BARRY BONDS,
 A-ROD, SAMMY SOSA -- NOTHING.

16:54.344 --> 16:57.147
MAX DOESN´T DREAM ABOUT
 BASEBALL.

16:57.147 --> 16:58.248
YOU´RE KIDDING.

16:58.248 --> 17:01.351
YOU´RE ON DECK, GEORGE.

17:01.351 --> 17:03.323
OOH! OOH!
 OOH! OOH!

17:03.323 --> 17:05.395
WHOO! OOH!
 WHOO!

17:06.726 --> 17:10.460
GUYS, I THINK I CAN HANDLE
 THE DREAM FROM HERE.

17:10.460 --> 17:12.462
GET UP, GEORGE.

17:12.462 --> 17:13.532
GET UP.

17:13.532 --> 17:15.665
COME ON, GEORGE.

17:15.665 --> 17:19.339
GET UP. GET UP.
 GET UP.

17:19.339 --> 17:22.212
GET UP, GEORGE.

17:22.212 --> 17:24.042
GET UP, YEAH.

17:24.042 --> 17:26.346
GET UP, GEORGE!
 GET UP!

17:26.346 --> 17:27.617
GET UP!

17:32.482 --> 17:34.154
I GOTTA TALK TO MAX.

17:37.157 --> 17:39.529
STOP DREAMING ABOUT
 JIM PALMER!

17:52.172 --> 17:53.573
MAX, YOU UP?

17:53.573 --> 17:55.775
I COULDN´T SLEEP.

17:55.775 --> 17:57.377
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

17:57.377 --> 18:01.111
I´M SORRY ABOUT THE
 BASEBALL, DAD.

18:01.111 --> 18:02.852
I FEEL SO BAD.

18:02.852 --> 18:05.315
I´LL PAY YOU BACK.

18:05.315 --> 18:08.118
MAX, I DON´T WANT YOU TO WORRY
 ABOUT THE BASEBALL.

18:08.118 --> 18:09.489
THAT´S
 NOT IMPORTANT ANYMORE.

18:09.489 --> 18:11.521
YOU´RE WHAT´S REALLY
 IMPORTANT TO ME.

18:11.521 --> 18:13.793
MORE
 IMPORTANT THAN CARMEN?

18:13.793 --> 18:16.366
WATCH ME.

18:16.366 --> 18:20.500
CARMEN IS JUST AS IMPORTANT
 TO ME AS YOU ARE.

18:20.500 --> 18:23.333
HAVE YOU EVER SAID THAT TO
 CARMEN?

18:23.333 --> 18:25.535
WATCH ME.

18:25.535 --> 18:26.676
NO.

18:28.608 --> 18:32.682
LISTEN, I WANT TO ASK YOU --
 DO YOU EVEN LIKE BASEBALL?

18:32.682 --> 18:34.144
IT´S OKAY.

18:34.144 --> 18:35.615
MAX, YOU CAN TELL ME THE
 TRUTH.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.387
I DON´T CARE IF YOU PLAY
 BASEBALL.

18:37.387 --> 18:39.149
I DON´T CARE IF YOU PLAY
 ANY SPORT.

18:39.149 --> 18:41.651
THEN I DON´T WANT TO PLAY
 ANYMORE.

18:41.651 --> 18:45.455
I JUST WANT TO HANG OUT
 WITH MY FRIENDS AND HAVE FUN.

18:45.455 --> 18:48.558
CAN I CALL IN SICK FOR
 TOMORROW´S GAME?

18:48.558 --> 18:50.700
SURE YOU CAN.

18:50.700 --> 18:52.702
I´LL CALL COACH BOBBY
 FOR YOU.

18:52.702 --> 18:56.666
AND WE´RE GONNA CELEBRATE
 WITH A STEAK DINNER!

18:56.666 --> 19:00.840
DAD, CAN I HAVE MY OWN
 GOOD-THINGS SHELF?

19:00.840 --> 19:02.272
YES.

19:02.272 --> 19:04.274
HEY, I KNOW WHAT COULD GO UP
 THERE.

19:04.274 --> 19:06.676
WHERE´S THAT MACARONI PICTURE
 FRAME I MADE FOR YOU?

19:06.676 --> 19:10.850
OH, THAT´S IN THE BACK OF MY
 GOOD-THINGS CLOSET.

19:10.850 --> 19:14.184
COME DOWNSTAIRS.
 I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

19:20.730 --> 19:23.493
WHAT´S MY WEDDING PICTURE
 DOING UP THERE?!

19:35.205 --> 19:38.208
NOW THE BALL´S A DIFFERENT
 GOOD THING.

19:38.208 --> 19:41.411
AND EVERY TIME I SEE IT,
 I´LL THINK OF YOU.

19:41.411 --> 19:43.953
HEY, WHAT´S THAT GLASS
 GOLF BALL?

19:43.953 --> 19:46.216
TOUCH IT
 AND I´LL KILL YOU!

19:51.921 --> 19:53.793
HOPE YOU SAW THAT,

19:53.793 --> 19:56.195
´CAUSE THAT´S THE LAST TIME
 I´M GONNA SHOW IT TO YOU.

19:59.899 --> 20:02.432
FRANK! FRANK!

20:02.432 --> 20:03.933
THE BALL´S WAY UP HERE!

20:03.933 --> 20:06.606
[ LAUGHS ]

20:06.606 --> 20:08.378
THE BALL´S --

20:08.938 --> 20:10.810
HOPE YOU SAW THAT,

20:10.810 --> 20:13.513
´CAUSE THAT´S THE LAST TIME
 I´M GONNA SHOW IT TO YOU.

20:17.317 --> 20:20.250
HOW TALL DO YOU THINK
 I AM, MAN?!
