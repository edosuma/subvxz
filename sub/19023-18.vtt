00:02.125 --> 00:04.500
Can I trade clipboards with you?

00:04.583 --> 00:07.458
Ok, fine, but mine's better.

00:09.208 --> 00:12.583
-You wanna trade?
-I guess so. Ok.

00:14.500 --> 00:15.875
Elliot, have you seen my clipboard?

00:15.959 --> 00:19.917
No. Oh, this'll be fun.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.667
J.D., I would like you to meet J.D.

00:22.750 --> 00:26.250
-(J.D.) How's it goin', man?
-Make him leave.

00:26.834 --> 00:28.333
Are you bummed out that
we have the same name?

00:28.917 --> 00:30.375
Oh, don't worry about it, man.

00:30.458 --> 00:32.166
I'll tell you what,
you're a little bit older than I am,

00:32.250 --> 00:33.792
so you were J.D. First.

00:33.875 --> 00:36.000
So how about you'll
be J.D. Number one,

00:36.083 --> 00:38.417
and I'll just be J.D. Number 2?

00:38.500 --> 00:42.625
-How about that?
-Hey, number 2.

00:43.125 --> 00:46.875
Ha. Hey, number one.
So, uh, I got one more patient.

00:46.959 --> 00:48.208
Do you wanna have lunch
in 10 minutes,

00:48.291 --> 00:49.291
and you can bring my clipboard?

00:49.375 --> 00:51.417
-Yeah.
-Hey, number 2.

00:51.500 --> 00:53.834
Number one!
All right. Cool.

00:53.917 --> 00:56.125
-(Jerry) Hey, number 2!
-Number one!

00:56.208 --> 00:59.375
(J.D.) <i>I honestly think the best part</i>

00:59.458 --> 01:02.583

<i>they're always grateful.</i>

01:03.166 --> 01:04.959
About time,<i> idiot.</i>

01:05.041 --> 01:08.333
Ok, Mr. Simon, good morning.
How are you feeling?

01:08.417 --> 01:11.166
I was just asking
Nurse Fajita here

01:11.250 --> 01:13.917
if you guys get extra points
for askin' stupid questions.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.583
Sir, I was just trying
to assess how you--

01:15.667 --> 01:19.041
-Bambi, don't bother.
-Carla, please.

01:19.125 --> 01:20.041
Sir, if there's anything

01:20.125 --> 01:22.166
we can do to make your stay
here more comfortable--

01:22.250 --> 01:24.834
You can kiss my man-sized ass.

01:25.417 --> 01:29.375
Ok, will you hold me after?
Heh, eh...

01:31.291 --> 01:33.375
Maybe we shouldn't bother.

(Jerry) Hey, number 2!

01:51.750 --> 01:53.750
-Hey, number one.
-(Jerry) Hey, number 2.

01:53.834 --> 01:57.375
Hey, Bambi, you know Mr. Simon
made one of the night nurses cry?

01:57.458 --> 01:59.750
-Which one?
-Frank.

01:59.834 --> 02:01.291
Frank used to be a Navy seal.

02:01.375 --> 02:03.583
-Hey, number 2!
-Hey, number one.

02:03.667 --> 02:06.083
You are a brave man.
You're an attending here,

02:06.166 --> 02:07.750
and not only are you
dating a med student,

02:07.834 --> 02:09.208
but you're holding hands
with her in public.

02:09.291 --> 02:10.500
Well, normally,
I would never do this,

02:10.583 --> 02:12.959
-but there are mitigating factors.
-Like what?

02:13.041 --> 02:15.500
Well, for starters,
you are very hot.

02:17.458 --> 02:22.083
Listen, I have kind of a special
evening planned for us.

02:22.166 --> 02:25.542
I'm not gonna give away everything,
but I will say it involves wine,

02:25.625 --> 02:27.041
an amazing dinner,

02:27.125 --> 02:30.417
and a safety word
we've agreed up on in advance.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.041
Oh.

02:33.667 --> 02:36.792
God, you are gonna
make a great mom.

02:38.041 --> 02:40.625
I told you what to do if those
stiches on your chest start to itch.

02:40.709 --> 02:41.625
Don't scratch.

02:41.709 --> 02:44.709
Unless they're really itchy,
and then, you go to town.

02:44.792 --> 02:46.875
You go nuts.
You do your thing.

02:47.000 --> 02:52.125
Dr. Reid, one of the nurses found
your stethoscope in the bathroom.

02:52.709 --> 02:55.000
-Thank you so much, sir.
-This isn't it, sweetheart.

02:55.083 --> 02:57.417
I had them leave yours
where it was.

02:57.500 --> 03:00.125
Let's try to be a little
more responsible, shall we?

03:00.625 --> 03:02.333
Oh, oh!

03:02.417 --> 03:04.750
I think I went to college
with that guy.

03:04.834 --> 03:06.625
Oh, lucky you.

03:06.709 --> 03:09.417
He used to play his guitar
every Saturday night

03:09.500 --> 03:11.917
at this coffee house off-campus.

03:12.458 --> 03:13.917
Remember the guy's name?

03:14.000 --> 03:17.333
Yeah. It was Robby...
Something, I think.

03:17.417 --> 03:19.959
You know, Dr. Kelso's name is Bob,
which is short for Robert,

03:20.041 --> 03:22.208
and Robby is another nickname
for Robert!

03:22.291 --> 03:24.000
Like, "Oh, my gawd!"

03:24.083 --> 03:26.458
Just give Mr Simon
30 mg of M.S. Contin.

03:26.542 --> 03:28.166
I don't understand
why I have to come with you.

03:28.250 --> 03:30.500
Because, Bambi,
you're kinda like a doctor.

03:30.583 --> 03:32.917
Now, come on.
He's just another patient.

03:34.125 --> 03:36.083
Simon says hello.

03:36.166 --> 03:38.041
What the hell do you want?

03:38.125 --> 03:41.917
Just gonna have Carla here give you
a little stronger pain medication.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.083
-Beat it, junior.
-Toodles.

03:46.750 --> 03:49.125
Well, you're all mine.

03:50.125 --> 03:51.542
Me no like-ee mean guys.

03:54.041 --> 03:55.458
Have you
seen my stethoscope?

03:56.583 --> 03:58.250
No. Um...

03:58.333 --> 04:00.834
Maybe you've left it
in one of the girls' bathrooms.

04:00.917 --> 04:01.875
What?

04:01.959 --> 04:04.834
Hey!
Hey, is that my stethoscope?

04:04.917 --> 04:06.291
This is mine.

04:06.959 --> 04:09.625
It's gettin' hot, redbird.
Pull me out.

04:11.333 --> 04:12.709
Hey, Kristin, slow down.

04:12.792 --> 04:15.333
You have no idea how many times
you're gonna say that tonight.

04:15.375 --> 04:18.125
-Boy, you're making it hard.
-You're gonna say that, too.

04:18.208 --> 04:21.000
'Cause, look,
somethin' has come up,

04:21.083 --> 04:22.917
and I'm not gonna be able
to make it tonight.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.125
-What?
-I know. I know.

04:24.208 --> 04:28.083
I'm sorry, but it's important.
It's very important.

04:28.166 --> 04:31.333
So thank you so much for giving me
a ride to pick up my new dresser.

04:31.417 --> 04:32.875
Please,
you know I love doin' favors.

04:32.959 --> 04:34.208
You hate doing favors.

04:34.291 --> 04:36.458
But I like doin' them for you.
That's a fact.

04:36.542 --> 04:38.959
Now, listen, even though I am
in the best shape of my life,

04:39.041 --> 04:41.041
and I am, by the way.

04:41.125 --> 04:42.125
I mean,
the fact of the matter is

04:42.208 --> 04:45.417
you could pretty much bounce
a damn quarter off my butt,

04:45.500 --> 04:48.917
you know, if you...
if you wanted to.

04:50.083 --> 04:53.125
I...
Don't have any change.

04:54.291 --> 04:56.750
Anyway, uh, I'm probably
gonna need your help

04:56.834 --> 04:58.291
gettin' the dresser up
on the roof here.

04:58.375 --> 05:00.667
Oh, I'm sure you guys
can handle it.

05:01.417 --> 05:02.291
(closes door)

05:02.375 --> 05:04.208
I beg your pardon?

05:04.291 --> 05:06.250
Dude, this is such a sweet ride.

05:06.333 --> 05:08.041
-You got seat belts back here?
-No.

I mean, I think it

06:28.750 --> 06:31.417
I'm not hiding from Mr. Simon.
I have a new exercise program.

06:31.500 --> 06:32.917
It's called "short bursts."

06:33.000 --> 06:34.583
-Is it working?
-Do you have to ask?

06:34.667 --> 06:36.917
-Yeah.
-Uh-huh. Where did Mr. Simon go?

06:37.000 --> 06:40.166
Well, I'm guessing not heaven.
He died.

-(Jerry) Hey, number two!
-Hey, number one. What happened?

06:42.709 --> 06:44.917
Bambi, he had terminal
metastatic colon cancer.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.875
He went into respiratory arrest
and passed away.

-(Jerry) Hey, number two!
-Hey, number one.

06:48.166 --> 06:49.291
Did you give him
a dose of Naloxone?

06:49.375 --> 06:51.959
Yes, Bambi. We tried intubating him.
We did CPR.

06:52.041 --> 06:53.583
We even tried
transcutaneous pacing.

06:53.667 --> 06:54.875

07:21.875 --> 07:23.000
You know,
you should lock your door.

07:23.083 --> 07:24.417
There's horrible people out there.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.792
There's horrible people
right in here.

07:27.875 --> 07:29.875
(Jordan)
Maybe you forgot how this works.

07:29.959 --> 07:33.750
See, when I say that "hi, honey"
thing, you take your pants off.

07:33.834 --> 07:35.542
See them's the rules
of the booty call.

07:35.625 --> 07:39.709
Jordan, believe me, I enjoy
our meaningless post-divorce sex

07:39.792 --> 07:42.250
as much as the next guy
you marry will,

07:42.333 --> 07:44.875
but your timing
could not be worse.

07:45.875 --> 07:49.875
Oh, maybe you don't remember
the terms of our settlement.

07:49.959 --> 07:54.000
When Jordan needs sex,
Jordan gets sex.

07:56.041 --> 07:59.500
Listen, sweet cheeks,
I am seeing someone.

07:59.583 --> 08:00.750
Let me guess. Let me guess.

08:00.834 --> 08:04.125
Dark hair, domineering,
doesn't take any of your crap?

08:04.208 --> 08:07.417
You see, a lesser person would
mock your inability to move on.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.542
I'm gonna consider it an homage.

08:11.041 --> 08:15.500
There is something so...
Soft about you.

08:15.583 --> 08:16.709
Yeah.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.083
Look, I'm seeing someone
right now,

08:23.166 --> 08:24.333
who, by the way, is great.

08:24.417 --> 08:29.208
And yet there's this other woman
who I cannot get out of my head.

08:29.291 --> 08:30.709
She's totally unavailable,

08:30.792 --> 08:34.458
which may be why
I can't get her out of my head.

08:34.542 --> 08:37.667
And maybe
and this is a whole new theory,

08:37.750 --> 08:41.208
I keep thinking of this other woman,
the unavailable one,

08:41.291 --> 08:44.250
because I am so afraid that the first
thing might actually work out,

08:44.333 --> 08:46.709
and, God forbid,
I ever do something

08:46.792 --> 08:49.125
that might actually make me happy.

08:49.875 --> 08:51.625
Do you have any idea
what I'm talking about?

08:52.208 --> 08:55.041
Oh, my God, if I have to stay here
and listen to this crap,

08:55.125 --> 08:56.667
I'll need a stronger drink.

08:58.083 --> 08:59.625
You know, I hate you.

08:59.709 --> 09:02.417
-I hate you, too, honey.
-Fair enough.

09:06.333 --> 09:08.083
I'm sure that was
Dr. Kelso singing.

09:08.166 --> 09:09.458
-It wasn't.
-Yeah, but what if it was?

09:09.542 --> 09:11.166
Elliot, stop, ok? Please?

09:11.250 --> 09:13.083
I don't want to have
this conversation again.

09:13.667 --> 09:15.583
-I really think it was him.
-It wasn't.

09:15.667 --> 09:17.959
-Yeah, but what if it was?
-Oh, good Lord, woman.

09:18.041 --> 09:20.542
Having a late-night tea party,
are we?

09:20.625 --> 09:23.375
Oh, I guess my invitation
must have been lost in the mail.

09:23.458 --> 09:27.041
Well, as long as I'm here,
I'm partial to lemon zinger.

09:27.125 --> 09:28.917
Sir, the reason Dr. Turk is here

09:29.000 --> 09:30.792
is 'cause this patient is going
into surgery tomorrow,

09:30.875 --> 09:33.333
but I was kind of hoping
we could do an E.R.C.P. first?

09:33.417 --> 09:36.542
Oh, you're breakin'
my Tuscaloosa heart.

09:36.625 --> 09:38.542
Just turf him.

09:39.542 --> 09:41.792
"Tuscaloosa heart." Hmm.

09:41.875 --> 09:45.417

<i>♪ Ha, ah-ha</i>
<i>I told you so ♪</i>

09:55.875 --> 09:57.959
-(J.D.) You guys awake?
-Holy son of a cracker!

09:58.041 --> 09:59.583
-Turk.
-Carla.

09:59.667 --> 10:03.083
Not now. Maybe in the morning
before work.

10:03.166 --> 10:06.458
Just thought I'd talk
to you guys, and...

10:07.417 --> 10:10.125
J.D., when you were a kid,

10:10.208 --> 10:12.125
did you used to walk
into your parents' room

10:12.208 --> 10:13.375
in the middle of the night?

10:16.333 --> 10:19.834
Mommy, are you and daddy
playing wheelbarrow?

10:19.917 --> 10:23.041
(daddy) Son, go back to bed.
I'm fixing mommy's back.

10:23.625 --> 10:25.000
Yes, once.

10:25.083 --> 10:26.542
Turk, you're not being
very sensitive.

10:26.625 --> 10:29.834
I'll be sensitive at breakfast, baby.
Turk out.

10:30.792 --> 10:32.208
What's up, Bambi?

10:32.291 --> 10:34.750
Oh, I just can't stop thinking
about Mr. Simon.

10:34.834 --> 10:36.625
I neglected him
'cause he was such a jerk,

10:36.709 --> 10:39.750
and I'm just kinda worried
that's what killed 'em.

10:39.834 --> 10:41.709
Well, it could
have been the neglect.

10:41.792 --> 10:44.458
Could have been
the terminal cancer.

10:44.542 --> 10:46.792
Bambi, you're
a conscientious doctor.

10:46.875 --> 10:50.000
You'd never do anything to hurt
a patient. You know that.

10:51.000 --> 10:54.125
You're right. Ach...

10:54.208 --> 10:58.166
-Heh. Thank you, Carla.
-(Carla) You're welcome.

10:58.250 --> 11:00.625
-(J.D.) Peace out, Turk.
-(Turk) Good night.

11:01.875 --> 11:03.917
(J.D.) <i>We all know</i>
<i>what goes on in the bedroom.</i>

11:04.000 --> 11:06.250
-Baby, since we're up.
-No.

11:06.333 --> 11:08.375
Ok. Ok.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.417
(J.D.) <i>But it's also the place to</i>
<i>reflect on what's new in your life.</i>

11:12.500 --> 11:14.709
Tell me about this girl you like.

11:15.875 --> 11:17.041
(J.D.)
<i>But, most importantly,</i>

11:17.125 --> 11:19.291
<i>it's where you can lie back,</i>
<i>let everything go,</i>

11:19.375 --> 11:22.208
<i>and finally just sleep.</i>

11:26.792 --> 11:28.208
<i>Or not.</i>

11:30.166 --> 11:33.166
<i>Ok, so you got a good 8,</i>
<i>9 minutes of sleep last night.</i>

11:33.250 --> 11:34.834
<i>Just remember, it's a new day.</i>

11:34.917 --> 11:37.583
<i>Yesterday's gone,</i>
<i>and it's never comin' back.</i>

11:37.667 --> 11:41.166
-Bambi. About yesterday.
-It's back.

11:41.250 --> 11:44.917
They want you to present Mr. Simon at
an M &amp; M conference this afternoon.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
(J.D.)
<i>Morbidity and Mortality conferences</i>

11:47.083 --> 11:48.291
<i>are just fun little meetings</i>
<i>they have</i>

11:48.375 --> 11:50.208
<i>when they think you might be</i>
<i>in any way responsible</i>

11:50.291 --> 11:51.583
<i>for a patient's death.</i>

11:51.667 --> 11:54.041
Bambi, don't be nervous.

11:55.291 --> 11:58.542
Is it hot in here?
It's like, it's hot.

12:00.083 --> 12:02.709
-No. I'm fine.
-Ok.

12:04.166 --> 12:05.834
(J.D.) <i>Still, there's no reason</i>
<i>to start obsessing.</i>

12:05.917 --> 12:07.375
<i>You did nothing wrong.</i>

12:08.500 --> 12:10.166
Morning, killer.

12:12.333 --> 12:14.083
Have a good one, killer.

12:16.333 --> 12:18.083
-Hey, number 2!
-Hey, number one.

12:18.166 --> 12:19.125
Hey, number 2!

12:19.208 --> 12:20.750
Ok, you have to stop doing that.

12:21.333 --> 12:22.917
-Look, number 1--
-Number 2--

12:23.000 --> 12:24.542
Ok, listen, I know
we have the same name,

12:24.625 --> 12:26.000
and I feel very bad about that,

12:26.083 --> 12:28.458
but I can't spend every second of
my day playing this game with you.

12:28.542 --> 12:32.417
I'm sorry. I... Ah...

12:34.625 --> 12:35.959
(quietly) Hey, number 2.

12:37.667 --> 12:39.625
-Hey, you.
-You got a minute?

12:39.709 --> 12:41.250
You know what would
make surgery quicker?

12:41.333 --> 12:43.500
If we didn't have to be so clean.

12:44.000 --> 12:47.291
Listen, I gotta say something
to you here. You, uh...

12:48.583 --> 12:52.750
You are so great, you know?
You're sexy. You're smart.

12:52.834 --> 12:54.542
God knows, you're dangerous.

12:54.625 --> 12:56.792
-You think I'm a spy?
-No.

12:57.625 --> 12:59.417
Look, I just want you to know

12:59.500 --> 13:02.625
that I haven't been
in this relationship 100%,

13:02.709 --> 13:04.583
and it's because of how great you are

13:04.667 --> 13:06.959
and just exactly how much
that scares me.

13:07.875 --> 13:10.792
But from now on, if you want,

13:11.667 --> 13:14.375
it's just that you're gonna
be gettin' the whole shebang

13:14.458 --> 13:16.333
'cause I'm all in, baby.

13:18.709 --> 13:19.709
Bring it.

13:19.792 --> 13:21.000
<i>♪ Ka-bow bow ♪</i>

13:21.083 --> 13:23.208

"My Bunny's A Baby Blue"
"Funny How Thing's Change"

13:27.792 --> 13:29.834
"B-U-N-N-Y Spells Love To Me."

13:29.917 --> 13:33.125
Oh, 10 songs about bunny.
Not one song about his wife.

13:33.625 --> 13:34.917
That's 'cause
it's physically impossible

13:35.000 --> 13:37.166
to write a love song
about anyone named Enid.

13:37.250 --> 13:38.959
Don't you even get it?

13:39.041 --> 13:41.417
This tape shows exactly
why Kelso is...

13:41.500 --> 13:45.166
Kelso. I mean,
he used to be this beautiful,

13:45.250 --> 13:46.917
wonderful, sweet, caring man.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.417
He found the love of his life,

13:48.500 --> 13:50.500
and, somehow,
she slips through his hands?

13:50.583 --> 13:52.917
Oh, that is so sad.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.375
Have you guys ever stopped to think

13:54.458 --> 13:58.375
that maybe bunny
is just a real bunny?

13:58.875 --> 14:00.625
Baby, that's just stupid.

14:02.333 --> 14:03.834
Yeah, I know.

14:06.208 --> 14:09.709
(J.D.)
<i>I'm ok. I'm ok. I'm ok.</i>

14:09.792 --> 14:13.125

14:13.208 --> 14:14.458
<i>What the hell does that mean?</i>

14:14.542 --> 14:19.709
Dr. Dorian, we have
examined Erin Simon's file.

14:19.792 --> 14:24.041
Before we begin,
do you have any last words?

14:25.166 --> 14:28.250
(drumming)

14:28.333 --> 14:30.375
I'm "a-Kay."

14:30.458 --> 14:32.625
That was terrible.
Can I have a do-over?

14:32.709 --> 14:33.709
(gunshot sound-effect)

14:33.792 --> 14:35.250
Initially, there were concerns

14:35.333 --> 14:37.834
that Mr. Simon may have
been overmedicated.

14:38.417 --> 14:41.083
We have concluded that
his pain control

14:41.166 --> 14:44.458
was both adequate and
well within the normal limits.

14:44.542 --> 14:46.500
Thank you for stopping by.

14:46.583 --> 14:49.083
Actually, sir, I'm not sure how
this whole thing usually works,

14:49.166 --> 14:53.083
but I was kinda hoping
we could take a closer look at me.

14:54.083 --> 14:56.750
I've been sorta doubting
my performance,

14:56.834 --> 15:01.750
and it would be really helpful
if we could just all talk about it.

15:01.834 --> 15:03.500
As a group.

15:06.875 --> 15:10.041
(J.D.) <i>Bottom line, Dr. Kelso</i>
<i>wasn't lookin' to do me any favors.</i>

15:10.125 --> 15:12.875
<i>If I did something wrong,</i>
<i>he'd call me on it.</i>

15:12.959 --> 15:14.458
Hmm!

15:15.041 --> 15:17.417
Then how come
I still can't sleep?

15:19.375 --> 15:21.875
-Oh, my God!
-No, I didn't do it.

15:21.959 --> 15:23.834
Oh, joy.

15:24.458 --> 15:26.625
See? I told you
when he saw us together

15:26.709 --> 15:28.583
he'd fold his arms
and do the teeth thing.

15:28.667 --> 15:30.959
You know, he did the same thing
the first time I saw him naked.

15:31.041 --> 15:32.917
-No way. Same here. Really?
-Yeah.

15:33.000 --> 15:36.417
Ok, this is...
Beyond tolerable.

15:36.500 --> 15:37.667
Would you relax, Perry?

15:37.750 --> 15:39.000
I just came by
for a board meeting,

15:39.083 --> 15:41.917
and I wanted to meet the
new lady in your life and warn 'er.

15:42.000 --> 15:42.959
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

15:43.041 --> 15:44.625
Kristin...

15:45.750 --> 15:50.834
This is my emotional baggage.
Baggage, Kristin.

15:50.917 --> 15:52.834
Oh, be nice.

15:52.917 --> 15:54.959
Hey! I just wanted
to thank you again

15:55.041 --> 15:56.500
for helping me move
that dresser last night.

15:56.583 --> 15:58.375
-Oh, sure. No problem.
-Thank you.

15:58.458 --> 16:00.458
-Great guy.
-See ya.

16:00.542 --> 16:01.959
Bye.

16:02.792 --> 16:07.250
-That's why you blew me off?
-Oh, I should leave.

16:07.333 --> 16:10.291
Moving furniture with that nurse
you have a crush on,

16:10.375 --> 16:11.625
that's your 100%?

16:11.709 --> 16:15.125
No, no. No, no. The 100%
actually came well after that.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.750
Look, her boyfriend
was there the entire time

16:18.834 --> 16:19.875
and if you want to know the truth,

16:19.959 --> 16:23.750
bailing on you is far and away the
best thing that could have happened

16:23.834 --> 16:27.333
because it made me realize that
I was sabotaging myself again.

16:27.917 --> 16:30.667
What? If you don't believe me,
ask Jordan.

16:30.750 --> 16:33.250
Would you please tell her
what I said to you

16:33.333 --> 16:34.417
right before you left this morning?

16:36.083 --> 16:37.625
Left where?

16:43.875 --> 16:45.542
You're unbelievable.

16:47.500 --> 16:50.667
That's too bad.
I liked her.

16:51.583 --> 16:55.709
I did, too.
Oh, dear God.

16:57.792 --> 16:59.458
(Elliot)
Let's just say something to him.

16:59.542 --> 17:02.125
-Like what?
-I don't know.

17:02.750 --> 17:04.583
"I heard some of your songs,
and I think they're extraordinary"?

17:04.667 --> 17:06.750
-Elliot, don't.
-I won't.

17:06.834 --> 17:08.166
Pinky swear.

17:10.709 --> 17:12.959
I heard some of your songs
and I think they're extraordinary!

17:13.542 --> 17:16.250
-Excuse me?
-You swore.

17:17.500 --> 17:19.792
Heh. You know what? Um...
Just forget it.

17:19.875 --> 17:21.667
We won't bother you anymore.

17:23.417 --> 17:26.083
(Turk)
Sir, whatever happened to bunny?

17:26.166 --> 17:27.583
We gotta know.

17:28.166 --> 17:31.583
Well, actually the music
came before bunny.

17:31.667 --> 17:33.667
I learned playin' guitar
growing up

17:33.750 --> 17:35.834
as a young rapscallion
in Mississippi,

17:35.917 --> 17:38.875
but things didn't really take off
until I moved to Memphis.

17:38.959 --> 17:42.500
Then I met the colonel,
and the hits just kept coming.

17:42.583 --> 17:44.542
Unfortunately,
it went to my head.

17:44.625 --> 17:47.333
I gained a lot of weight,
started wearing a white jumpsuit,

17:47.417 --> 17:49.667
and ate tranquilizers
like they were trail mix.

17:49.750 --> 17:53.583
-Sir--
-Then in 1977, I died on the toilet.

17:54.583 --> 17:56.667
Or did I?

17:56.750 --> 17:58.542
You never played the guitar,
did you?

17:58.625 --> 18:00.667
Son, that crap is for hippies!

18:00.750 --> 18:02.959
Now, for God's sake,
get back to work.

18:03.041 --> 18:04.333
Yes, sir.

18:04.417 --> 18:07.417
(imitating Elvis)
Thank you very much.

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
(J.D.) <i>Ultimately, I always turn</i>
<i>to the person I trust the most</i>

18:11.083 --> 18:12.458
<i>'cause I know when</i>
<i>he looks me in the eye</i>

18:12.542 --> 18:15.417
<i>and says I didn't do anything wrong,</i>
<i>I'll actually believe it.</i>

18:16.041 --> 18:18.750
Yep. Looks like you screwed
the pooch, there, Tinkerbell.

18:18.834 --> 18:20.083
But I didn't overmedicate him.

18:20.166 --> 18:22.959
Of course you didn't. I always check
your orders after you make them.

18:23.041 --> 18:24.959
But if you're wondering

18:25.041 --> 18:27.250
whether or not you treated
Mr. Simon differently

18:27.333 --> 18:29.959
because he's a complete jerk,
well...

18:30.041 --> 18:32.792
I think you know the answer
to that one already, don't ya?

18:33.375 --> 18:34.917
Oh, depends on what you
mean by "different." I--

18:35.000 --> 18:36.125
I have to warn you,

18:36.208 --> 18:41.417
I just got dumped in front of
my ex-wife not 10 minutes ago.

18:44.375 --> 18:47.125
It's always easy to treat
the nice ones nice, isn't it?

18:47.750 --> 18:49.000
Uh-huh.

18:49.083 --> 18:51.750
But your drug addicts,
your child abusers,

18:51.834 --> 18:53.750
your garden variety jerks,

18:53.834 --> 18:56.083
(whistles) Man!

18:57.625 --> 19:00.500
You know, it's, uh...
It's barely misting out.

19:00.583 --> 19:03.000
It's my hair.
If it even gets damp,

19:03.083 --> 19:06.083
it frizzes out and
becomes wildly unmanageable.

19:06.583 --> 19:08.083
(whispers) Mine, too.

19:08.625 --> 19:10.917
It was a joke, ya girl.

19:11.959 --> 19:13.625
Look, newbie,

19:13.709 --> 19:15.875
the only way to judge
your growth as a doctor

19:15.959 --> 19:18.333
and, hell, as a human being,

19:18.417 --> 19:22.000
is by making sure you don't repeat
the same mistakes over and over.

19:25.375 --> 19:27.917
Oh...

19:28.041 --> 19:30.709
That was really great and all, but
next time, would you do me a favor

19:30.792 --> 19:31.834
and not look me in the eye?

19:31.917 --> 19:34.250
It really gets in the way
of what I come here to do.

19:34.333 --> 19:37.583
Then, for God's sakes,
stop turnin' around.

19:37.667 --> 19:40.291
-Well, that's classy.
-(Dr. Cox) No. Wait a minute.

19:40.375 --> 19:43.667
You don't have to go,
you know, if--

19:43.750 --> 19:44.875
if you don't want to.

19:44.959 --> 19:47.375
Oh, my God,
are you really that lonely?

19:47.458 --> 19:49.125
Kinda. Yeah.

19:50.333 --> 19:52.917
All right, I'll toss you a quickie,
but no talking.

19:56.041 --> 19:57.834
(Dr. Cox)
I'll talk if I want to, you know.

19:57.917 --> 19:59.625
(Jordan) Yeah. Be quiet.
