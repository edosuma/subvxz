00:01.085 --> 00:02.964
<i>Previously on</i>
The Handmaid's Tale...

00:03.048 --> 00:04.927
<i>What does it mean</i>
that they came here?

00:05.010 --> 00:06.346
It means I have to leave.

00:07.431 --> 00:08.433
<i>Mayday will help us.</i>

00:08.518 --> 00:10.563
They'll get us to a cell
on the western border.

00:10.647 --> 00:12.651
No, thanks. I want out
of this fucking place.

00:12.734 --> 00:14.821
‐They've gotten us this far.
‐Exactly.

00:14.905 --> 00:15.740
I don't want to fight.

00:16.617 --> 00:18.203
None of us wanted to, at first.

00:19.038 --> 00:20.542
Did you hear from Mayday?

00:20.625 --> 00:22.086
The contact
will only talk to you.

00:22.169 --> 00:23.714
Do you have a safe house for us?

00:23.798 --> 00:25.342
Yeah. The Murrows.

00:25.425 --> 00:27.764
It's a yellow farmhouse
about 13 miles west of you.

00:28.390 --> 00:30.687
<i>I saw some military</i>
Commanders on the way in.

00:30.770 --> 00:32.439
Yeah, they're here
for a couple more days.

00:32.524 --> 00:34.653
One last party before Chicago.

00:34.736 --> 00:36.574
Just fucking sitting ducks.

00:36.657 --> 00:39.788
You really think that Mayday
would liberate this place?

00:39.871 --> 00:40.999
It isn't an army.

00:41.709 --> 00:42.836
We are Mayday.

00:42.919 --> 00:44.673
<i>They're people just like us.</i>

00:44.756 --> 00:46.677
Handmaids.
More trouble than they're worth.

00:46.760 --> 00:49.516
More misled than sinful,
in this case.

00:49.600 --> 00:53.983
They were led astray
by a gifted and amoral liar.

00:54.191 --> 00:56.697
So, you're just gonna
get yourself killed or caught?

00:56.780 --> 00:58.325
Yeah, that's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

00:58.408 --> 00:59.285
So, what then?

00:59.368 --> 01:01.080
Red Leader standing by.

01:01.164 --> 01:02.584
Get them ready.

01:02.667 --> 01:04.755
<i>We're the ones</i>
we've been waiting for.

01:04.880 --> 01:08.512
When she is hanging on the wall,
justice will be done.

01:10.349 --> 01:11.644
Something's wrong.

01:12.061 --> 01:14.398
‐You should go. Now.
‐I'm not leaving you.

01:17.154 --> 01:18.699
And bring her to me.

01:25.128 --> 01:26.924
Where are the Handmaids?

01:27.007 --> 01:28.343
I'm trying to keep you alive.

01:54.437 --> 01:55.898
‐

02:23.996 --> 02:25.332
ID, please.

02:28.379 --> 02:30.133
Clear. Under His eye.

04:09.708 --> 04:11.753
Mrs. Keyes is safe in custody.

04:16.345 --> 04:18.349
The other Handmaids
are still at large.

04:24.738 --> 04:27.117
They moved on
to the next safe house.

04:28.996 --> 04:30.331
That's what they assume.

04:42.105 --> 04:43.901
If you don't tell them
where they are,

04:45.571 --> 04:46.823
I can't help you.

04:51.207 --> 04:53.211
Please let me help you.

04:55.340 --> 04:58.346
‐

05:08.867 --> 05:10.286
Hello, dear.

05:15.965 --> 05:17.885
Thank you, Commander Blaine.

05:18.971 --> 05:21.350
Ofjoseph is in good hands.

05:21.433 --> 05:23.312
I am here as her advocate.

05:23.939 --> 05:26.695
Think of me
as her guardian angel.

05:29.784 --> 05:31.203
Be strong with the Lord...

05:33.499 --> 05:35.170
and in the strength
of His might.

06:40.968 --> 06:43.180
You wicked, wicked girl.

06:43.264 --> 06:45.936
All those children,
taken from their homes.

06:46.020 --> 06:48.734
Did you give one thought
to their poor parents?

06:50.529 --> 06:52.825
Did you think about
how I would feel?

06:54.704 --> 06:57.417
You have caused so much pain.

06:57.918 --> 06:59.922
I hope you're happy
with yourself.

07:31.235 --> 07:32.487
Lieutenant.

07:36.120 --> 07:39.084
Ofjoseph, the lieutenant
has questions for you,

07:39.167 --> 07:41.130
I'm sure you are eager to help.

07:42.550 --> 07:43.677
Let's get this off.

07:43.718 --> 07:44.971
No, no, no, no, no.

07:45.096 --> 07:46.975
You don't need to be scared.

07:47.058 --> 07:49.146
Yeah, that's better.

07:49.897 --> 07:51.943
Blessed be the fruit, Ofjoseph.

07:53.822 --> 07:55.283
Where are the other Handmaids?

07:58.957 --> 08:00.794
Tell him, dear.

08:00.878 --> 08:04.886
While God's merciful light
still shines upon you.

08:07.725 --> 08:09.394
There is no light here.

08:16.701 --> 08:19.456
God has forsaken this place.

08:23.632 --> 08:25.552
I'm sorry.
Are you all right?

08:26.971 --> 08:29.184
Just tell me,
where are the other Handmaids?

08:31.773 --> 08:34.027
You have no answers for me?

08:34.110 --> 08:36.073
Are you sure, sweetheart?

08:37.660 --> 08:38.954
Yes, she is.

08:39.412 --> 08:41.709
Ofjoseph is always
very, very sure.

08:42.377 --> 08:44.214
Praise be. Gentlemen.

08:50.476 --> 08:53.357
Bless us, O Lord,
for this holy service

08:53.440 --> 08:56.405
we are grateful to perform
in Your name.

08:56.488 --> 08:59.662
In our search for justice,
may You guide this sinner

08:59.745 --> 09:03.127
to righteousness and repentance.

09:04.547 --> 09:05.799
Amen.

09:21.789 --> 09:23.208
It's all right. Shh.

09:29.847 --> 09:31.016
All right then.

10:01.577 --> 10:02.913
‐

10:27.588 --> 10:29.132
She's been captured.

10:30.886 --> 10:32.054
That's confirmed.

10:33.641 --> 10:34.894
So, is she alive?

10:36.313 --> 10:37.315
Yes.

10:39.820 --> 10:42.366
They have three solid sources.

10:42.450 --> 10:45.874
But, unfortunately,
I don't think

10:46.082 --> 10:48.797
we'll get much more information.

10:57.731 --> 10:59.108
Will there be a trial?

11:00.402 --> 11:03.033
Possibly, but nothing public.

11:04.954 --> 11:06.498
They won't announce the verdict.

11:09.254 --> 11:10.715
What about sentencing?

11:11.132 --> 11:14.557
Honestly,
we'll probably never know.

11:19.315 --> 11:20.735
You got somewhere to be?

11:22.321 --> 11:23.407
I'm sorry.

11:26.079 --> 11:28.166
There's not much more
we can do at this stage.

11:30.630 --> 11:31.841
Thank you.

11:31.924 --> 11:33.010
Thanks, Rachel.

11:34.304 --> 11:35.389
Okay.

11:43.447 --> 11:45.619
My grandmother used to bury
a green persimmon

11:45.702 --> 11:47.873
in the backyard for luck.

11:52.173 --> 11:53.342
For what it's worth.

12:29.247 --> 12:32.587
That lieutenant
is very determined.

12:35.009 --> 12:36.386
If you don't cooperate,

12:36.469 --> 12:39.810
I fear things might get
quite a bit worse for you.

12:41.312 --> 12:44.277
Ofrobert, Oferic, Ofhoward
and the others...

12:45.237 --> 12:49.997
all wanted fugitives
in grave danger because of you.

12:51.416 --> 12:52.794
Bring them home.

12:52.878 --> 12:56.342
‐This isn't their home.
‐Because you corrupted them!

12:56.426 --> 13:00.225
They had a life of meaning here,
a life of service.

13:00.309 --> 13:04.400
There is no meaning
in this place except violence.

13:05.027 --> 13:06.530
Ah.

13:06.864 --> 13:09.578
You... You told those girls

13:10.370 --> 13:15.882
that if they followed the rules,
they'd be okay.

13:19.515 --> 13:22.228
Then you sent them out
to be raped

13:22.311 --> 13:26.402
and beaten and humiliated.

13:26.946 --> 13:30.745
Over and over and over.

13:37.174 --> 13:38.845
You failed them.

13:40.013 --> 13:41.474
You shut your mouth!

13:46.652 --> 13:49.198
You failed them.

13:50.284 --> 13:51.745
Didn't you?

13:52.831 --> 13:57.464
You failed your precious girls.

13:59.845 --> 14:03.351
‐It is your fault, Aunt Lydia.
‐Oh, no.

14:03.476 --> 14:04.730
‐
‐Lieutenant!

14:04.813 --> 14:08.571
Your fault!
Your fault, isn't it?

14:08.654 --> 14:11.034
Listen to me.
It is your fault, isn't it?

14:11.660 --> 14:13.496
Get up. You get up.

14:13.831 --> 14:15.167
Get up, I said!

14:16.002 --> 14:17.964
You are a miserable beast.

14:21.722 --> 14:22.724
Lydia.

14:28.778 --> 14:30.322
What did you call me?

14:30.447 --> 14:31.366
Oh...

14:32.619 --> 14:33.621
Lydia.

14:39.256 --> 14:40.927
You know, Janine,

14:43.641 --> 14:44.810
your girl,

14:46.772 --> 14:48.358
she was so easy.

14:50.863 --> 14:53.786
She turned on you
in a fucking second.

15:06.895 --> 15:10.360
Well, good. Back to work.

15:25.390 --> 15:29.231
It's only through
true suffering of the flesh

15:29.315 --> 15:31.779
that we shall find His love.

15:40.880 --> 15:42.592
You can stop this anytime.

15:48.813 --> 15:50.315
Don't.

15:52.821 --> 15:53.823
Don't.

15:57.747 --> 15:58.916
Aunt Lydia?

16:00.252 --> 16:01.212
Yes?

16:02.590 --> 16:04.093
I know where they are.

16:06.682 --> 16:09.521
I know where they are.
They went to Vermont.

16:11.650 --> 16:14.698
They're in a library
in Burlington at the university.

16:17.829 --> 16:19.791
They're waiting there
to cross the border.

16:22.630 --> 16:25.636
Now, let's get you some
dry clothes and a place to stay.

16:27.264 --> 16:28.391
Shall we?

16:32.274 --> 16:33.318
Bless you.

17:34.608 --> 17:35.985
Hey, I'm headed out.

17:37.154 --> 17:38.323
It's early, right?

17:38.741 --> 17:40.368
It's gonna be a crowded march.

17:41.329 --> 17:43.333
A lot of people
want to pray for June.

17:45.630 --> 17:47.550
‐It's gonna be nice.
‐Yeah.

17:48.384 --> 17:49.554
I could wait for you guys.

17:49.638 --> 17:50.848
Hmm, nah.

17:52.059 --> 17:53.144
I'm...

17:53.771 --> 17:55.608
‐
‐Bless you.

17:56.150 --> 17:59.239
We're gonna get you a bath,
ain't we? Hmm?

17:59.783 --> 18:02.789
We're gonna get your a bath
and an early bedtime for once.

18:10.095 --> 18:11.138
Come on.

18:14.353 --> 18:16.065
June's in prison...

18:17.150 --> 18:19.238
and we're lighting candles.

18:21.660 --> 18:24.123
We're doing everything
we can for her.

18:24.206 --> 18:25.543
Yeah, don't rub it in.

18:38.109 --> 18:39.529
Did she choose this?

18:39.612 --> 18:40.781
Who, June?

18:42.409 --> 18:44.246
No, she didn't choose this.

18:45.081 --> 18:48.881
Because she chose
to stay in Gilead,

18:49.883 --> 18:52.220
right, and she knew
she'd probably get caught.

18:54.266 --> 18:55.268
Maybe.

18:57.607 --> 18:59.485
Die trying to do something good.

19:02.617 --> 19:03.827
It's just...

19:03.911 --> 19:06.875
It's just she knew she'd
probably never see me again.

19:08.336 --> 19:09.338
Right?

19:12.010 --> 19:15.308
She knew she'd probably never
see either of us again.

19:18.189 --> 19:21.530
And, um,
that's the choice that she made

19:21.613 --> 19:26.080
and, uh, you know,
I gotta respect it.

19:26.748 --> 19:28.334
I gotta respect her.

19:37.227 --> 19:39.983
I can't ask God for something
that she didn't want.

19:42.320 --> 19:44.784
Well, God's been looking out
for her so far.

19:51.756 --> 19:53.134
All right, look,
I'll see you later.

19:53.217 --> 19:55.054
I gotta... I gotta go.

19:55.430 --> 19:57.852
Uh, be safe. Be careful.

20:23.528 --> 20:24.614
Poor choice.

20:28.037 --> 20:30.208
I will never tell you
where they are.

20:32.713 --> 20:38.517
Brave words of Ofjoseph,
but... just words.

22:35.249 --> 22:40.928
Thou shalt not steal,
nor cheat, nor lie,

22:41.386 --> 22:44.685
for I am the Lord thy God.

22:47.482 --> 22:48.484
Wow.

22:49.110 --> 22:51.406
What a crazy night, huh?

22:58.546 --> 23:01.803
Now, where are the Handmaids?

23:03.765 --> 23:04.976
June...

23:07.731 --> 23:09.317
don't tell them anything.

23:35.369 --> 23:36.748
You can save her.

23:40.672 --> 23:42.467
Come on. Come on.

23:42.593 --> 23:44.889
Come on, it's all right.
Come on.

23:45.222 --> 23:46.475
Yeah. It's all right.

23:47.895 --> 23:48.980
Good girl.

23:52.236 --> 23:53.322
So...

23:55.409 --> 23:56.871
tell me where they are.

24:36.116 --> 24:36.951
June...

24:37.578 --> 24:38.580
‐

24:42.336 --> 24:43.422
What a shame.

24:46.178 --> 24:48.307
Aw...

24:51.480 --> 24:54.068
Please don't lie to me again.

25:20.412 --> 25:22.375
No. No.

25:22.834 --> 25:24.379
No, no.

25:54.439 --> 25:58.906
Well, she isn't stupid,
but she is stubborn,

26:00.284 --> 26:05.795
which I guess
is a form of stupidity.

26:06.463 --> 26:08.885
Perhaps it's the most
virulent form.

26:12.183 --> 26:15.356
Here's the thing, you owe me.

26:16.734 --> 26:18.236
You can't save her.

26:20.491 --> 26:22.161
You understand that, right?

26:25.209 --> 26:29.635
She is never coming back to you.

26:30.553 --> 26:32.139
Why would she?

26:32.223 --> 26:33.308
I know.

26:35.145 --> 26:36.356
I just, you know...

26:38.861 --> 26:40.406
I want her to stay alive.

26:41.408 --> 26:42.577
Yeah, well...

26:47.963 --> 26:50.426
It's always nice to want things.

26:51.804 --> 26:53.516
You used to want things, too.

26:55.018 --> 26:56.564
You wanted things to change.

26:57.189 --> 26:59.402
June did that.
She changed Gilead.

26:59.485 --> 27:02.158
Gilead was ripe for an overall.

27:02.199 --> 27:04.287
But she changed me,
she changed you.

27:04.370 --> 27:07.001
So perhaps,
she's fulfilled her purpose,

27:07.084 --> 27:08.546
and it's time to move on.

27:18.064 --> 27:19.233
I can't...

27:23.576 --> 27:24.661
move on.

27:27.249 --> 27:28.251
I can't.

27:33.763 --> 27:34.973
I know.

27:39.650 --> 27:41.194
I wish I could help you.

27:50.254 --> 27:54.470
You're getting very
comfortable here, in this house.

27:56.057 --> 27:57.769
It's my home.

27:59.063 --> 28:01.735
Actually, it was gonna be
Commander Cooper's home.

28:02.319 --> 28:04.156
Till he found a Victorian
he liked more.

28:04.741 --> 28:07.789
Cooper's a toady with no taste.

28:09.626 --> 28:11.170
It could help you, too.

28:12.172 --> 28:13.341
Getting June to talk.

28:15.680 --> 28:17.559
It could help you
stay in this house.

28:21.149 --> 28:22.234
What are saying?

28:24.656 --> 28:25.658
You owe me.

28:26.702 --> 28:28.038
You already said that.

28:29.666 --> 28:30.918
Bears repeating.

Yeah? Come on.

30:10.993 --> 30:12.622
Come on.

30:20.763 --> 30:22.600
Mommy needs some good luck.

30:24.395 --> 30:26.148
I got one of these.

30:30.658 --> 30:31.660
Look.

30:34.583 --> 30:35.877
Here's the persimmon.

30:37.170 --> 30:38.214
Now, hold that.

30:45.771 --> 30:47.984
Now, we're gonna put that...
put it in there.

30:48.736 --> 30:51.909
Drop it down. Put it in.

30:52.619 --> 30:54.079
There you go.

31:05.519 --> 31:06.521
All done.

31:09.485 --> 31:12.074
Come on, we should go
wash hands, huh, Supergirl?

31:12.157 --> 31:13.744
You want to wash hands?

31:14.411 --> 31:15.706
All right.

31:17.334 --> 31:18.796
Oh, who's a good girl?

31:21.593 --> 31:22.595
Good girl.

32:37.578 --> 32:38.580
Hi.

32:48.349 --> 32:49.727
You've looked better.

32:56.700 --> 32:58.077
You should eat.

33:00.624 --> 33:02.377
No one's gonna hurt you here.

33:06.720 --> 33:07.889
Go ahead, eat.

33:37.531 --> 33:39.284
I didn't think
you'd end up back here.

33:44.002 --> 33:45.296
They need me...

33:47.008 --> 33:48.261
especially now.

33:53.312 --> 33:55.901
Nine Commanders in the hospital,

33:55.985 --> 33:57.613
six dead.

33:57.738 --> 33:59.701
Some bad liquor...

34:01.412 --> 34:03.792
at Jezebel's in Pennsylvania.

34:05.838 --> 34:06.881
It's bad luck.

34:11.181 --> 34:12.100
June...

34:16.609 --> 34:20.450
You have to tell me
where the Handmaids are.

34:36.775 --> 34:38.277
June,

34:39.947 --> 34:41.951
you have to tell me
where they are.

34:48.965 --> 34:50.594
Or they will hurt Hannah.

34:55.521 --> 34:57.023
They will hurt her.

35:15.644 --> 35:16.646
No.

35:23.952 --> 35:25.496
No, the Gilead...

35:31.091 --> 35:32.887
they'd never hurt a child.

35:37.479 --> 35:39.483
That's all they care about.

35:39.942 --> 35:42.489
Gilead doesn't care
about children.

35:43.575 --> 35:45.788
Gilead cares about power.

35:49.587 --> 35:53.427
Faithfulness, old‐time values,
homemade bread...

35:53.762 --> 35:55.181
That's...

35:57.770 --> 36:00.483
Just the means to the end.

36:00.526 --> 36:02.905
It’s distraction
and window‐dressing.

36:05.159 --> 36:07.455
I thought you would've
figured that out by now.

36:10.838 --> 36:13.384
I thought you were gonna
clean up your mess.

36:15.471 --> 36:18.269
I can't do it
from the end of a rope.

36:23.237 --> 36:24.740
This is where we are.

36:30.418 --> 36:31.420
Well...

36:39.185 --> 36:40.606
Go fuck yourself.

37:01.480 --> 37:06.616
Motherhood's always been
an evolutionary puzzle to me.

37:19.099 --> 37:19.934
Gentlemen.

37:27.908 --> 37:31.833
I was hoping
we could avoid this.

38:35.752 --> 38:36.796
It's all right.

38:39.175 --> 38:40.177
I like it.

38:44.185 --> 38:45.187
That's good.

39:52.363 --> 39:53.616
It's okay.

39:59.377 --> 40:00.797
It's okay, baby.

40:18.624 --> 40:19.793
It's okay.

40:35.240 --> 40:36.409
It's okay.

40:46.931 --> 40:48.266
It's okay, baby.

41:15.613 --> 41:17.576
They're at
the Murrow farmhouse,

41:20.665 --> 41:23.336
13 miles west
of the Keyes' place.

41:27.637 --> 41:30.685
It was lovely
meeting you, June Osborn.

41:31.227 --> 41:32.480
Thanks for helping.

41:49.180 --> 41:50.808
Come along, dear.

41:51.476 --> 41:52.478
Come, dear.

41:54.858 --> 41:56.402
‐Come along.
‐No.

41:56.444 --> 41:57.781
We've got to go now, come on.

41:59.743 --> 42:00.745
Yes. Okay.

42:02.039 --> 42:03.333
Honey, you've got to get up now.

42:04.335 --> 42:06.966
All right. Come on, dear.
She's safe.

42:07.383 --> 42:09.846
She's safe. You're okay.
Come on now.

42:09.972 --> 42:11.307
You've got to rest.

42:12.059 --> 42:13.563
Baby...

42:15.650 --> 42:17.111
Come along now.

43:03.788 --> 43:05.499
Wake up. Wake up.

43:06.084 --> 43:07.086
Wake up.

43:08.421 --> 43:10.217
Hey. What?

43:19.402 --> 43:20.571
What is this?

43:21.489 --> 43:23.326
Commander Murrow,
where are they?

43:25.247 --> 43:26.457
Get out of my house!

43:26.499 --> 43:28.546
‐

44:25.325 --> 44:26.787
Blessed evening, dear.

44:37.224 --> 44:38.686
All of our wayward girls

44:38.769 --> 44:41.567
have been retrieved
safe and sound,

44:41.650 --> 44:42.902
thanks to you.

44:57.306 --> 44:58.474
Aunt Lydia.

44:59.268 --> 45:00.478
Yes, dear.

45:05.907 --> 45:07.284
I'm ready.

45:07.869 --> 45:09.204
Ready for what?

45:12.127 --> 45:13.589
For all it to be over.

45:15.801 --> 45:16.803
What?

45:20.393 --> 45:21.479
I'm ready.

45:27.992 --> 45:29.161
Please.

45:32.710 --> 45:33.921
Just kill me.

45:34.506 --> 45:36.760
Oh!

45:39.516 --> 45:42.229
You're not going to be executed.

45:42.354 --> 45:44.358
None of you are.

45:44.441 --> 45:46.738
Not one Handmaid can be spared.

45:46.822 --> 45:48.408
We lost so many children,

45:48.575 --> 45:49.828
thanks to you.

45:51.080 --> 45:53.001
All of you girls
were chosen by God

45:53.084 --> 45:55.715
and you will discharge
your sacred duty.

45:57.844 --> 46:01.685
‐We're getting new postings?
‐In a manner of speaking.

46:03.564 --> 46:07.237
You are all going
to a Magdalene Colony.

46:10.285 --> 46:12.289
You will labor in the fields.

46:13.332 --> 46:16.506
And when you are ripe,
your Commander and his wife

46:16.631 --> 46:20.514
will come to you
and perform the ceremony.

46:21.558 --> 46:24.647
Then you will rejoin
your sister's at work.

46:25.566 --> 46:29.574
You will all live out your days
in a blessed cycle of service.

46:33.372 --> 46:34.584
A breeding colony.

46:36.755 --> 46:39.886
An innovation
I had my doubts about,

46:41.180 --> 46:44.854
but I can see the value
for certain temperaments.

46:50.908 --> 46:52.912
‐

46:53.037 --> 46:55.793
My sweet girl. Hmm?

46:58.381 --> 47:00.636
So much change to adjust to.

47:03.015 --> 47:07.274
But try to remember
that all of this is your doing.

47:08.944 --> 47:13.494
Everything that has
happened to you, to Hannah,

47:13.579 --> 47:16.960
to Janine and the others,
to those poor Marthas,

47:17.795 --> 47:19.047
all of it,

47:20.258 --> 47:21.761
you're responsible.

47:24.474 --> 47:25.895
Your fault.

47:27.982 --> 47:29.193
Your choice.

47:35.664 --> 47:37.417
Your choice.

47:37.585 --> 47:38.629
Hmm?

47:40.465 --> 47:41.718
Ah, no, no, no.

47:46.310 --> 47:48.565
All right,
let's get you cleaned up.

47:49.233 --> 47:52.072
This is the start
of a new adventure.

49:04.801 --> 49:05.803
Praise be.

49:11.815 --> 49:14.277
‐

49:49.599 --> 49:50.976
Keep walking.

51:05.626 --> 51:06.961
Hannah's back home.

51:10.594 --> 51:11.679
She's safe.

51:19.235 --> 51:20.321
I'm sorry.

51:23.828 --> 51:24.789
I had to do what I had to do

51:24.830 --> 51:25.874
‐to keep you‐‐
‐Stop.

51:33.932 --> 51:35.434
She was scared of me.

51:39.860 --> 51:41.906
She wasn't scared of them.

51:48.335 --> 51:49.755
She was scared of me.

51:50.674 --> 51:52.886
She was... She was scared.

51:52.970 --> 51:55.015
My baby was scared of me.

51:57.186 --> 51:58.940
She wasn't scared of them.

51:59.900 --> 52:01.863
‐Listen to me.
‐

52:01.988 --> 52:03.157
She didn't know me.

52:03.157 --> 52:05.077
‐Hey.
‐She didn't know me.

52:05.579 --> 52:06.789
She loves you.

52:10.337 --> 52:11.339
She loves you.

52:12.008 --> 52:12.968
I love you.

53:40.017 --> 53:41.186
I love you.

53:44.359 --> 53:45.444
I love you.

54:59.802 --> 55:00.970
It's gonna be
a little while.

55:01.054 --> 55:04.101
If you don't mind,
I'm gonna go use the necessary.

55:04.185 --> 55:05.605
Oh, of course.
