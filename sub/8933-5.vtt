00:01.668 --> 00:02.235
This is the Evergreen

00:02.235 --> 00:02.369
This is the
Evergreen forest.

00:03.803 --> 00:05.939
Quiet, peaceful, serene.

00:07.807 --> 00:10.343
That is, until
Bert Raccoon wakes up.

00:10.343 --> 00:12.078
Bert Raccoon: Yahoooo!

00:13.880 --> 00:15.648
Yeeeehaaaa!

00:16.583 --> 00:17.617
Yikes!

00:17.917 --> 00:19.552
Yaaaah...

00:22.222 --> 00:23.790
Yeaaaah!

00:23.790 --> 00:26.659
Luckily, he has some
good friends to help him out.

00:34.034 --> 00:36.369
Life would be simple
in the forest except for...

00:37.937 --> 00:39.472
Cyril Sneer!

00:43.176 --> 00:45.111
And his life would be simple
except for...

00:46.312 --> 00:47.480
the Raccoons!!

00:47.480 --> 00:49.616
♪ (show theme music) ♪

01:01.594 --> 01:05.098
A good photographer is always
ready to cover any story.

01:05.098 --> 01:09.369
And so, even on a lazy summer
evening by Evergreen Lake,

01:09.369 --> 01:12.872
Melissa Raccoon makes sure her
camera is close at hand.

01:12.872 --> 01:14.841
Because you never know

01:14.841 --> 01:16.776
when the big story
might come along.

01:17.877 --> 01:20.947
Ooh, what
a gorgeous sunset.

01:20.947 --> 01:23.683
A perfect end
to a perfect day.

01:23.683 --> 01:25.952
Yeah, Melissa,
I gotta admit it.

01:25.952 --> 01:29.089
You sure know how to
pack a picnic basket.

01:29.089 --> 01:32.225
And you sure know
how to empty one, Bert!

01:33.159 --> 01:34.727
Now, where has Ralph gone?

01:34.727 --> 01:36.296
Oh, he's around.

01:36.796 --> 01:38.765
Hey, watch
this Melissa.

01:38.765 --> 01:42.235
Bet I can make this
rock skip 20 times!

01:43.736 --> 01:45.905
One, two, three, four

01:45.905 --> 01:47.073
Fi-fi...

01:47.073 --> 01:50.510
Fi-fire breathing monster!

01:50.510 --> 01:52.078
Melissaaaaa!

01:52.078 --> 01:53.113
I see it Bert!

01:53.113 --> 01:55.682
What is it? This is incredible!
Come quick!

01:55.682 --> 01:57.984
I can't believe it!
Raaaalph!

02:00.153 --> 02:03.223
I got it! I've got
a picture of it, Bert!

02:03.223 --> 02:05.225
Fantastic Melissa!

02:05.225 --> 02:07.594
The photo of the century!

02:07.594 --> 02:09.996
W-whhaat's wrong?
Are you two alright?

02:09.996 --> 02:11.564
You're not gonna
believe this, Ralph!

02:11.564 --> 02:15.335
W-w-w-we just saw a
monster in the lake!

02:15.335 --> 02:16.603
It was huge!

02:16.603 --> 02:19.472
It was.. It was.. humungous!!

02:19.472 --> 02:21.241
Sure you did, Bert.

02:21.241 --> 02:22.876
And I was over by the bikes,

02:22.876 --> 02:25.512
chatting with the
abominable snowman.

02:25.512 --> 02:26.646
It's true, Ralph!

02:26.646 --> 02:28.314
We saw something in the lake!

02:28.314 --> 02:30.450
It-it looked like a monster!

02:30.450 --> 02:32.685
Oh, come on, Melissa.

02:32.685 --> 02:35.188
You don't expect me
to believe that, do you?

02:35.188 --> 02:36.823
I took
a picture of it!!

02:36.823 --> 02:38.625
The proof's right
here, Ralph!!

02:38.625 --> 02:41.027
I've got a picture
of a monster!!

02:41.027 --> 02:45.398
A monster.
In Evergreen Lake.

02:45.398 --> 02:47.667
Wow!

02:53.606 --> 02:55.141
I got the picture!!

02:55.141 --> 02:57.877
Look at it.
Just look at it!

02:57.877 --> 03:00.980
That's a monster,
if I ever saw one!

03:00.980 --> 03:02.248
I don't know, Melissa.

03:02.248 --> 03:05.151
It could be anything.
Oh hi, Cedric.

03:05.151 --> 03:08.221
C'mon, Ralph.
It's a great photo!

03:08.221 --> 03:09.856
What a story this'll be.

03:09.856 --> 03:11.524
We'll be. Er...

03:11.524 --> 03:13.860
You'll be famous, Melissa.

03:13.860 --> 03:16.963
A photo of a real
live sea serpent!

03:17.564 --> 03:19.165
What d'you say, Cedric?

03:19.165 --> 03:20.800
You don't think
there's a monster in there,

03:20.800 --> 03:22.202
do you Cedric?

03:22.202 --> 03:25.205
Well, um...
Evergreen Lake

03:25.205 --> 03:28.408
is very old and very deep.

03:28.408 --> 03:30.677
No one has explored it properly.

03:30.677 --> 03:33.780
I suppose it is.. possible.

03:33.780 --> 03:36.349
What do you
mean possible, Cedric!?

03:36.349 --> 03:39.586
I saw as plain as, as...

03:39.586 --> 03:42.789
As plain as the
nose on your face.

03:42.789 --> 03:45.225
Well, why hasn't
anyone seen it before?

03:45.225 --> 03:48.528
Well, uh, maybe
it's a shy monster...

03:48.528 --> 03:50.263
Okay, Ralphi boy.

03:50.263 --> 03:55.401
Let's get started on the special
monster edition of the Standard.

03:56.302 --> 03:57.437
With this photo?

03:57.437 --> 03:58.905
Not a chance.

03:58.905 --> 04:00.607
We've got to have
more than this.

04:00.607 --> 04:03.209
I don't believe it.

04:03.209 --> 04:05.545
The biggest story the
Standard ever had

04:05.545 --> 04:07.714
and you want to
stifle it, Ralph!?!

04:07.714 --> 04:11.084
Exactly. Until
we get more proof.

04:11.084 --> 04:13.052
Well, I think,
we have an obligation

04:13.052 --> 04:16.089
to let everyone know there's
something in Evergreen Lake,

04:16.089 --> 04:17.457
right, Cedric?

04:17.457 --> 04:19.959
Yeah. I guess so.

04:19.959 --> 04:21.928
Bert?
Yeah!!!

04:21.928 --> 04:23.296
Ralph?

04:28.601 --> 04:31.838
The Bears:

04:31.838 --> 04:34.874
I love marking
things up 300%!

04:41.748 --> 04:42.815
Pig 1: Uh-oh!

04:42.815 --> 04:45.518
Hmmmm. Cheap
plastic binoculars.

04:45.518 --> 04:48.121
Recommended price $1.98

04:48.121 --> 04:50.790
Hmmm. Multiply that by 40.

04:50.790 --> 04:52.792
Carry the four. Add tax.

04:52.792 --> 04:53.826
Round it off ...

04:53.826 --> 04:56.329
We'll sell these at
$50 bucks apiece.

04:56.329 --> 04:57.697
Pig 2: Oh goody!

04:57.697 --> 05:00.633
I guess that's what you
call demand and supply.

05:00.633 --> 05:03.803
No! That's what
you call highway robbery!

05:05.238 --> 05:07.607
Gee, Pop.
What's going on?

05:07.607 --> 05:08.808
Are you kidding?

05:08.808 --> 05:10.543
Haven't you seen this?

05:10.543 --> 05:12.478
Um.. Yes.

05:12.478 --> 05:13.880
You know
what it means?

05:13.880 --> 05:16.382
It means hordes of tourists

05:16.382 --> 05:18.318
flocking to see this thing.

05:18.318 --> 05:21.020
And that means hordes of money

05:21.020 --> 05:23.656
for someone with business sense.

05:23.656 --> 05:25.992
Someone like me!

05:25.992 --> 05:29.796
But Pop, you don't
believe in monsters, do you?

05:29.796 --> 05:31.197
I don't have to.

05:31.197 --> 05:33.032
Ha! Everyone else does.

05:36.369 --> 05:39.639
You go past the
Raccoon Dominium, turn left,

05:39.639 --> 05:40.907
and you'll see the lake.

05:40.907 --> 05:42.642
A radio interview?

05:42.642 --> 05:45.144
Sure, let me check my schedule.

05:45.845 --> 05:48.848
No.. Tomorrow afternoon's good.

05:48.848 --> 05:50.049
See you then.

05:50.049 --> 05:52.785
I can't believe this, Ralph.

05:52.785 --> 05:54.721
I've been asked
to do a radio show,

05:54.721 --> 05:56.923
a magazine layout
and a talk show.

05:56.923 --> 05:58.825
I'm a celebrity!

05:58.825 --> 06:00.259
Come on, Melissa.

06:00.259 --> 06:02.995
You have to admit this
is getting out of hand.

06:02.995 --> 06:05.331
What can you tell
them about monsters?

06:05.331 --> 06:07.066
You took one blurry photo

06:07.066 --> 06:09.168
and now you're a monster expert?

06:09.168 --> 06:11.471
The thing's even got a name now.

06:11.471 --> 06:13.840
Evie! It's ridiculous!

06:13.840 --> 06:15.675
Ya, you're
absolutely right, Ralph.

06:15.675 --> 06:17.377
Evie is a silly name.

06:17.377 --> 06:20.079
Maybe Melissa and I can
think up a better one.

06:22.215 --> 06:24.550
Evergreen Standard.

06:24.550 --> 06:25.918
Can I help you?

06:25.918 --> 06:29.922
Boy, Cedric. Can you
believe all this excitement?

06:29.922 --> 06:31.924
Well, it's not every day

06:31.924 --> 06:34.460
a monster turns up
in Evergreen Lake.

06:34.460 --> 06:37.830
Cedric, we need a
close-up of that monster!

06:37.830 --> 06:40.900
And you and me are gonna get it.

06:40.900 --> 06:42.335
I don't know, Bert.

06:42.335 --> 06:45.304
I've got a lot of
typing to catch up on.

06:45.304 --> 06:46.873
Tonight, Cedric.

06:46.873 --> 06:48.574
You and me.

06:50.209 --> 06:52.845
Pig 1:
Scary Lloyd.

06:52.845 --> 06:54.547
Real scary.

06:55.815 --> 06:58.017
Pig 2: Right this way...

06:58.017 --> 06:59.452
Straight ahead.

07:01.954 --> 07:05.892
Hi! Welcome to
the Evergreen forest!

07:05.892 --> 07:07.760
Good to see you.
Have a nice time!

07:07.760 --> 07:09.262
Oh, hi there!

07:09.262 --> 07:13.099
Wow! This
is really something.

07:13.099 --> 07:16.235
The monster's put the
Evergreen forest on the map!

07:16.235 --> 07:18.838
It's fantastic.
Huh, Cedric?

07:21.507 --> 07:23.943
Gee, Bert,
I don't know.

07:23.943 --> 07:26.979
Well, at least
Bert's enjoying it.

07:26.979 --> 07:29.749
If I could only
get a good clear picture,

07:29.749 --> 07:31.784
we could figure out
what that thing is.

07:31.784 --> 07:34.587
I thought you were sure
it was a monster, Melissa.

07:34.587 --> 07:35.988
Changing your mind?

07:35.988 --> 07:38.491
I said, it
looked like a monster.

07:38.491 --> 07:41.494
Everybody else is saying
it is a monster.

07:41.494 --> 07:44.997
Whatever. It's getting
ridiculous around here!

07:44.997 --> 07:46.799
The forest is a mess.

07:46.799 --> 07:50.970
I can't even walk along the road
without a bus tour driving by

07:50.970 --> 07:54.507
and pointing me out as the
husband of Melissa Raccoon,

07:54.507 --> 07:56.242
monster photographer!

07:56.242 --> 08:00.179
There's even a society for the
preservation of monsters.

08:00.179 --> 08:02.849
Melissa, we don't
even have a monster!

08:02.849 --> 08:04.817
If I didn't
know you better, Ralph,

08:04.817 --> 08:06.719
I'd say you were jealous!

08:06.719 --> 08:09.222
Jealous?
Of a blurry photo?

08:09.222 --> 08:11.791
I just don't want you
to look foolish, Melissa.

08:11.791 --> 08:15.194
There's just no such
thing as monsters!

08:15.194 --> 08:17.129
Ralph.

08:17.964 --> 08:20.800
Portrait of a jealous man.

08:34.947 --> 08:37.116
I-I don't see it, yet.

08:37.116 --> 08:39.051
Me neither.

08:39.051 --> 08:42.355
Maybe we can go home now..?

08:46.392 --> 08:47.393
Shhh!

08:48.828 --> 08:49.862
What's that?

08:49.862 --> 08:52.565
Wh-wh-who's there?

08:54.667 --> 08:57.036
Bert/Cedric: Yaaahhhhh!!!!!!

09:03.209 --> 09:04.544
Yeow!!!
Oooh!

09:04.544 --> 09:06.579
Schaeffer?...Melissa?!

09:07.580 --> 09:09.982
What are you doing out here?

09:09.982 --> 09:12.451
Oh, hi, Bert.
Cedric?

09:12.451 --> 09:14.854
We were just trying
to get more evidence.

09:14.854 --> 09:15.888
U-u-us too.

09:15.888 --> 09:18.925
W-w-why don't you take
that end of the lake,

09:18.925 --> 09:20.893
and we'll keep looking here.

09:20.893 --> 09:23.529
Okay, Bert.
Yell, if you see something.

09:23.529 --> 09:25.965
Don't worry. He will!

09:34.373 --> 09:35.875
Hey, Melissa?

09:35.875 --> 09:38.711
I thought you were going to
check the other end of the lake!

09:45.518 --> 09:46.886
Melissa?

09:46.886 --> 09:51.257
Schaeffer is that you?

09:51.257 --> 09:53.292
M-M-Melissa?

09:53.292 --> 09:54.894
Rooooooaaaaaarrrrrrhhhhh!!!!!

09:54.894 --> 09:56.762
Yaaahhhh!!!

09:56.762 --> 09:59.665
Row, Cedric, rooooow!

10:03.135 --> 10:04.770
Well, boss, we think,

10:04.770 --> 10:08.874
this new line of T-shirts
will really catch on.

10:08.874 --> 10:10.509
That is without doubt

10:10.509 --> 10:13.579
the tackiest thing,
I've ever seen!

10:13.579 --> 10:15.715
It'll sell like hot cakes!

10:15.715 --> 10:18.417
And how about this, boss?

10:20.219 --> 10:21.253
Nifty, huh?

10:21.253 --> 10:23.289
Never mind
this penny ante stuff.

10:23.289 --> 10:25.591
What's the status
on the land grab?

10:25.591 --> 10:28.427
We've bought up all
the shore front property

10:28.427 --> 10:30.963
on the lake, except one lot.

10:30.963 --> 10:33.966
And it's gone way
up in price, boss.

10:33.966 --> 10:36.736
Buy it. I don't
care what it costs.

10:36.736 --> 10:38.270
Money's no object.

10:38.270 --> 10:40.539
Uh.. are you
all right, boss?

10:40.539 --> 10:42.108
Of course I'm all right!

10:42.108 --> 10:43.376
Never been better.

10:43.376 --> 10:45.978
Now get out there
and buy me that land!

10:45.978 --> 10:47.680
Yes, sir! Yes, sir!

10:54.553 --> 10:55.621
They found it last night

10:55.621 --> 10:58.124
when they were running
away from the 'monster.'

10:58.124 --> 10:59.859
What do you make
of it, professor?

10:59.859 --> 11:04.030
Smedley-Smythe: W-well...
Nothing at the moment. No.

11:04.030 --> 11:08.467
I-I'll need to make a plaster
impression of the print

11:08.467 --> 11:11.804
and-and then we'll see...

11:11.804 --> 11:13.305
what we'll see.

11:13.305 --> 11:15.341
Melissa,
reports tell us

11:15.341 --> 11:17.276
that you were attacked
by the monster.

11:17.276 --> 11:19.145
I was attacked
by the monster!

11:19.145 --> 11:21.213
It was horrible!

11:21.213 --> 11:24.950
It had fangs two
feet long. And, and...

11:24.950 --> 11:27.720
Tell us Melissa,
were you terrified beyond words

11:27.720 --> 11:29.989
when you saw this
monster creature?

11:29.989 --> 11:32.758
Now let's not
jump to conclusions here.

11:32.758 --> 11:34.660
Jump to
conclusions!?

11:34.660 --> 11:36.495
It's a monster alright!

11:36.495 --> 11:39.832
With slimy, horrible,
yucky green scales,

11:39.832 --> 11:43.169
a-a-and big claws and, and...

11:43.169 --> 11:46.072
Well, look at the
size of its feet!

11:46.072 --> 11:47.473
There you have it.

11:47.473 --> 11:48.941
The scientific proof.

11:48.941 --> 11:52.712
Evie, the monster of
Evergreen Lake, exists.

11:58.884 --> 12:02.021
Pig 1: Attention! Attention!

12:02.021 --> 12:05.291
We have an important
announcement!

12:05.291 --> 12:09.361
Pig 2: In light of the strange
activity in Evergreen Lake,

12:09.361 --> 12:12.231
the boss, er.. Cyril Sneer,

12:12.231 --> 12:14.533
invites you all to an important

12:14.533 --> 12:16.869
press conference this evening.

12:16.869 --> 12:20.740
This is something you
can't afford to miss!

12:20.740 --> 12:22.608
Pig 1: At his lakeside tent.

12:22.608 --> 12:25.878
Of course, refreshments
will be available

12:25.878 --> 12:28.714
at outrageous prices!

12:28.714 --> 12:31.250
Pig 2: Thank you for
your attention!

12:37.456 --> 12:40.126
Since the monster,
Evie, was spotted

12:40.126 --> 12:42.561
we've had a lot of suckers,
er, tourists.

12:42.561 --> 12:44.330
And I know what they want.

12:44.330 --> 12:45.865
This!!

12:45.865 --> 12:47.933
Sneer's Monster Theme Park.

12:47.933 --> 12:51.137
To be built right here on
the shores of Evergreen Lake.

12:51.137 --> 12:54.573
There'll be 2,000 rooms,
8 restaurants,

12:54.573 --> 12:56.976
4 discos and a bowling alley.

12:56.976 --> 12:59.879
Not to mention
parking for 5,000.

12:59.879 --> 13:01.046
Metered, of course.

13:02.214 --> 13:05.084
And now, to give you a sample of
the quality entertainment

13:05.084 --> 13:08.287
the Sneer Monster
Theme Park will provide,

13:08.287 --> 13:11.290
I present Sneer's Aquacade,

13:11.290 --> 13:13.459
featuring talented amateurs.

13:17.096 --> 13:19.431

All this and more at
Sneer's Monster Complex

14:19.692 --> 14:21.560
and condo park.

14:21.560 --> 14:24.730
This was all made
possible by Evie,

14:24.730 --> 14:26.832
the monster of Evergreen lake.

14:32.171 --> 14:36.008
Mhm, alright!
I'll tell them.

14:36.675 --> 14:39.745
That was professor
Smedley-Smythe.

14:39.745 --> 14:42.414
He's been checking out
that footprint we found,

14:42.414 --> 14:44.350
and he's puzzled by it.

14:44.350 --> 14:45.851
What did
he say, Cedric?

14:45.851 --> 14:48.020
After rechecking
his measurements,

14:48.020 --> 14:51.357
he found the footprint
was of an even depth.

14:51.357 --> 14:53.092
That's not normal.

14:53.092 --> 14:56.161
Well, it's a
monster print, Cedric.

14:56.161 --> 14:58.063
Of course it's not normal.

14:58.063 --> 15:00.532
Any footprint
is deeper at the heel...

15:00.532 --> 15:01.901
Or the toe.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.669
The monster's isn't.

15:03.669 --> 15:05.871
So, what does it mean?

15:05.871 --> 15:07.439
I don't really know.

15:07.439 --> 15:10.442
And neither does
professor Smedley-Smythe.

15:10.442 --> 15:13.879
He wants to get a closer
look at the monster tonight.

15:13.879 --> 15:15.547
So do I!

15:15.547 --> 15:16.949
I don't know, Melissa.

15:16.949 --> 15:18.384
It could be risky.

15:18.384 --> 15:21.086
But Ralph, you've
been telling me all along

15:21.086 --> 15:22.788
there is no monster.

15:22.788 --> 15:24.857
So what's the risk?

15:24.857 --> 15:27.259
(sighs) Oh boy...

15:28.394 --> 15:30.362
Having a monster
in Evergreen Lake

15:30.362 --> 15:32.765
is like having a
licence to print money.

15:34.199 --> 15:36.068
How are the receipts boys?

15:36.068 --> 15:39.371
We're not doing
as well as we thought, boss.

15:39.371 --> 15:43.575
People don't want to pay
$70 for a pair of sunglasses.

15:43.575 --> 15:46.378
Oh, alright.
Slash the price.

15:46.378 --> 15:48.047
Put them on special.

15:48.047 --> 15:49.949
$69.95

15:49.949 --> 15:51.250
Anything else?

15:51.250 --> 15:54.586
What about...
tonight, Sir?

15:54.586 --> 15:56.021
Ah, yes!

15:56.021 --> 15:58.324
I think, it'd
be very, ummm...

15:58.324 --> 15:59.658
convenient,

15:59.658 --> 16:03.062
if the monster
makes an appearance.

16:03.062 --> 16:05.297
Yes. Yes it would, boss.

16:10.769 --> 16:13.439
Smedley-Smythe: This
could prove to be exciting.

16:13.439 --> 16:16.809
I've never been on
a monster hunt before.

16:16.809 --> 16:21.180
I have a theory that
this creature might be

16:21.180 --> 16:24.116
from the later Jurassic era.

16:24.116 --> 16:26.018
That late huh?
Smedley-Smythe: Yes.

16:28.854 --> 16:31.523
Monster!

16:34.259 --> 16:35.627
Here they come!

16:35.627 --> 16:38.764
Now, get out there
and sell, sell, sell.

16:41.266 --> 16:44.470
♪ (suspenseful music) ♪

16:53.445 --> 16:55.881
There it is!
The monster!

17:09.128 --> 17:12.297
I got it! I got it!

17:13.732 --> 17:15.667
Oh-oh! It's got me!

17:15.667 --> 17:17.736
It's got me!

17:17.736 --> 17:18.837
Cedric/Melissa: Bert!!

17:18.837 --> 17:21.540
Help!! Stop!!

17:21.540 --> 17:23.675
Blub! Blub!

17:23.675 --> 17:26.011
Pig 1: Did you hear that?
Pig 2: What?

17:26.011 --> 17:30.015
Pig 1: Oh, I guess it
was nothing. More fog!

17:30.015 --> 17:33.585
Pig 3: Coming..right..up!
Ah-ah!

17:35.054 --> 17:36.255
Heeeelp!

17:37.089 --> 17:38.490
Full speed ahead!

17:38.490 --> 17:40.993
Let's have another
blast of fire!

17:40.993 --> 17:43.896
Give the tourists
their money's worth!

17:43.896 --> 17:45.564
Bert!!
Can you hear us?!!

17:45.564 --> 17:46.665
Bert!!

17:48.367 --> 17:50.102
Oh no!

17:50.102 --> 17:51.170
No!!!

17:59.244 --> 18:00.612
Did you see that?

18:02.514 --> 18:03.882
Pig 2: Sure, Lloyd!

18:03.882 --> 18:06.251
Funny, very funny!

18:11.390 --> 18:12.591
Smedley-Smythe: I say! Listen.

18:13.525 --> 18:17.229
Do you hear it?
I do believe it's...

18:17.229 --> 18:19.631
a mechanical monster!

18:19.631 --> 18:22.301
Real or not,
it's going to ram us!!

18:25.137 --> 18:27.906
Pig 1: Well, that's it
for the 10 o'clock run.

18:27.906 --> 18:30.776
Time to get Evie
back to the garage.

18:30.776 --> 18:33.712
Pig 3: It was a brilliant
show tonight, guys.

18:33.712 --> 18:35.747
The tourists will love it.

18:35.747 --> 18:37.883
And the boss'll love us!

18:39.284 --> 18:41.153
Pig 2:
He'd better.

18:41.153 --> 18:42.988
I've been slaving over

18:42.988 --> 18:46.592
a hot monster... all night.

18:46.592 --> 18:48.227
Ah-aaah!

18:56.068 --> 18:58.303
Yahoooo!!

18:58.303 --> 18:59.304
What's happening?

18:59.304 --> 19:00.839
Look out!!

19:00.839 --> 19:02.774
Aaaarrrgghh!

19:02.774 --> 19:04.910
Smedley-Smythe:
Hang on Berty, old boy!

19:04.910 --> 19:08.914
It's heading for shore!
Yipeeee, yahoooo!!

19:08.914 --> 19:10.015
Let's go!

19:10.015 --> 19:13.652
I'm giving you good
people the first shot

19:13.652 --> 19:16.488
at investing in
my new theme park.

19:16.488 --> 19:19.925
All you have to do
is sign right here,

19:19.925 --> 19:21.493
on the dotted line.

19:26.698 --> 19:27.699
That's right!

19:27.699 --> 19:29.801
Go get those cheque books!

19:30.936 --> 19:33.372
Relax. It's just a monster.

19:34.540 --> 19:36.341
Whaaaa?!
What are you doing?!!

19:36.341 --> 19:38.177
Get that thing out of here,

19:38.177 --> 19:39.545
you hair brained ham hocks!!

19:39.545 --> 19:42.347
Yahoooo!

19:43.815 --> 19:45.684
Aaaaahhhhh!!!!!

19:48.654 --> 19:51.790
Wow! What a ride!

19:54.893 --> 19:56.161
Pig 1: Hi, boss.

19:57.029 --> 19:59.464
Pig 2: Um, w-we
seem to have had

19:59.464 --> 20:02.000
a small accident... boss.

20:02.868 --> 20:06.138
Accident?
I'll show you an accident!

20:06.138 --> 20:08.874
Pop. Pop. Pop.

20:08.874 --> 20:10.475
It's a fake.
- I told you it was fake.

20:10.475 --> 20:13.378
It wasn't a fake,
it was just a rip off!

20:13.378 --> 20:16.848
(laughs) It's not
what it looks like, folks.

20:16.848 --> 20:18.817
I'll say...

20:18.817 --> 20:20.552
Wait! Come back!!!

20:20.552 --> 20:23.589
Sneer monster hot dogs
are now only a dollar.

20:23.589 --> 20:26.391
Souvenir sunglasses
a buck ninety eight.

20:26.391 --> 20:29.027
It's a steal!
A buck fifty nine..!

20:29.528 --> 20:30.829
Fifty cents!

20:30.829 --> 20:32.698
Come back, oh come back!

20:32.698 --> 20:33.932
Ooohh!!!

20:33.932 --> 20:37.102
Looks like your
monster's all washed up, Cyril.

20:37.102 --> 20:38.904
Give us a big smile!

20:42.374 --> 20:46.078
Evergreen Lake is
calm and peaceful once again.

20:46.078 --> 20:48.447
The storm Melissa
started with her

20:48.447 --> 20:51.383
photograph of a monster
has passed.

20:51.383 --> 20:53.619
With the help of her friends,
Melissa learned

20:53.619 --> 20:56.622
that things are not always as
they appear.

20:56.622 --> 20:59.958
Sometimes, you have to look
beneath the surface

20:59.958 --> 21:01.426
to find the truth.

21:03.262 --> 21:04.329
What a mess!

21:04.329 --> 21:06.732
I've lost a fortune!

21:06.732 --> 21:10.135
I'm stuck with miles
of useless beach.

21:10.135 --> 21:14.573
My warehouse is packed
with monster memorabilia!

21:14.573 --> 21:16.575
And to make matters worse,

21:16.575 --> 21:20.445
those Raccoons have
plastered my face

21:20.445 --> 21:22.447
all over their
so called newspaper.

21:23.582 --> 21:26.485
Come in. And it'd
better be important!

21:27.319 --> 21:28.820
Uaah-uaaah!

21:29.955 --> 21:32.891
Pig 1:
Pretty realistic, huh boss?

21:32.891 --> 21:37.429
Pig 2: I figure we can make a
fortune with this baby, boss!

21:38.130 --> 21:39.731
Right, boss?

21:40.732 --> 21:44.803
Pig 3: Uummm. Did we come
