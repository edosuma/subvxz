10:55.572 --> 10:56.823
- Listen.
- What?

10:56.865 --> 10:59.743
We appreciate the hustle,
but we can't do this shit.

10:59.785 --> 11:01.536
We're never gonna be able
to learn this dance.

11:01.578 --> 11:04.664
Yes, you can.
You boys just need to put in more effort.

11:04.706 --> 11:06.708
Dude, we've been at this for weeks.

11:06.750 --> 11:09.294
We're gonna look like fucking idiots
out there.

11:09.336 --> 11:13.340
Dancing is in your blood.
We're Jewish. Jews can't dance.

11:13.382 --> 11:18.095
No matter how much we practice this shit,
we're never gonna be able to do it.

11:19.805 --> 11:21.348
We're Jewish.

11:21.390 --> 11:22.724
We're Jewish.

11:22.766 --> 11:24.393
We have small dicks.

11:24.434 --> 11:26.853
Look, all of this means
you just wanna give up?

11:26.895 --> 11:28.021
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

11:28.063 --> 11:29.106
That's ridiculous.

11:29.147 --> 11:31.149
We're just Jewish.
It's nothing against you.

11:31.191 --> 11:33.902
- SAM: Yeah.
- I have such a small dick.

11:33.944 --> 11:36.321
Hey, boys. How's the dance going?

11:36.363 --> 11:38.573
- Dance is looking awesome.
- Great.

11:38.615 --> 11:41.952
Mom. Mom, look,
we're--we're not gonna be great. Okay?

11:41.993 --> 11:44.913
Is there any way
that we can just skip the dance?

11:44.955 --> 11:47.666
- No, we cannot skip the dance.
- But, Mom--

11:47.707 --> 11:49.251
Are you seriously
talking back to me right now?

11:49.292 --> 11:52.087
Do you have any idea
how much stress I am under tonight?

11:52.129 --> 11:54.589
The dance is the last thing
I need to be thinking about.

11:54.631 --> 11:58.718
I threw this whole party for you,
and this is the respect I get.

11:58.760 --> 12:00.929
We're gonna look like idiots out there.

12:00.971 --> 12:02.389
Well, you better not.

12:02.431 --> 12:06.309
'Cause if you go out there looking
like idiots, I will be so embarrassed.

12:07.894 --> 12:09.938
Don't you dare embarrass me.

12:09.980 --> 12:11.356
ERIC: Shit.

12:11.398 --> 12:12.566
[gulps]

12:13.650 --> 12:15.902
Good luck on the dance, boys.

12:15.944 --> 12:19.114
- Bye, Mrs. Drucker.
- Bye, Sherryl. Nice talking to you.

12:19.156 --> 12:20.323
- You're scary.
- GERALD: Told you.

12:20.365 --> 12:22.701
BOY'S VOICE: Cool.

12:22.742 --> 12:25.412
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

12:25.454 --> 12:27.998
Bubbie, this is David.

12:28.039 --> 12:31.751
This is the David
you've been telling me about.

12:31.793 --> 12:32.794
Yeah.

12:32.836 --> 12:35.046
David, your boyfriend.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.923
This is my boyfriend, David.

12:38.133 --> 12:39.968
What is this, some kind of joke?

12:40.010 --> 12:41.803
You wanna give your Bubbie
a heart attack?

12:41.845 --> 12:43.847
No. What's wrong with David?

12:43.889 --> 12:46.725
Oh...[speaking Yiddish]

12:46.766 --> 12:51.021
I'm sorry your Bubbie
has to be the one to tell you this, but...

12:51.062 --> 12:53.148
your boyfriend is a faygella.

12:57.360 --> 12:59.154
I have no idea what you just said.

12:59.196 --> 13:03.158
I'm saying he likes
to make sex with boys.

13:03.200 --> 13:05.202
Are you saying David is gay?

13:05.243 --> 13:08.288
Yes. He likes penis.

13:08.330 --> 13:10.499
Bubbie, David is straight.

13:10.540 --> 13:15.378
We are boyfriend and girlfriend
in a heterosexual romance.

13:16.796 --> 13:19.424
- Oh!
- What about my Jason?

13:19.466 --> 13:20.675
[farts]

13:20.717 --> 13:21.927
Oh, fuck!

13:21.968 --> 13:25.555
You told me that you would set up
my grandson with your granddaughter.

13:25.597 --> 13:28.808
Well, what can I do?
She's in love with a homosexual.

13:28.850 --> 13:31.019
- I want my teeth back.
- Hey, hey, hey!

13:31.061 --> 13:34.314
Okay. Wait. I have other options.

13:34.356 --> 13:35.565
Come with me.

13:35.607 --> 13:37.859
- [speaking Yiddish]
- You.

13:39.653 --> 13:41.279
What the fuck just happened?

13:41.321 --> 13:44.282
My grandma. She's always trying
to set me up with these weird-ass dudes,

13:44.324 --> 13:46.535
so I was just trying
to get her off my back.

13:46.576 --> 13:48.370
Grandma's a big, fat cunt.

13:48.411 --> 13:50.455
She's actually kind of amazing.

13:50.497 --> 13:53.625
I mean, she deduced in 10 seconds
what Bobby couldn't in 10 years.

13:53.667 --> 13:57.045
- You still haven't told Bobby yet?
- Okay. It's not that simple.

13:57.087 --> 13:59.172
All right? If I tell him,
it would just make things weird.

13:59.214 --> 14:00.674
How would it make things weird?

14:00.715 --> 14:03.093
Have you met Bobby before?
It would make things weird.

14:03.134 --> 14:05.637
Are you done crying?
Are you gonna cry a little more?

14:05.679 --> 14:09.015
'Cause my brother won't fuck you? Thanks.

14:09.057 --> 14:11.851
Ssloo.

14:11.893 --> 14:14.688
Mm. Fftt.

14:16.439 --> 14:18.024
Oh. Um...Hey.

14:18.066 --> 14:19.985
- Hey.
- Mrs. Greenberg, how's it going?

14:20.026 --> 14:21.987
Are you enjoying the evening?

14:22.028 --> 14:24.197
Oh, Bobby, come on.
How long have you known me?

14:24.239 --> 14:25.865
Call me Susie.

14:25.907 --> 14:28.618
Fftt. Right, Susie. Fair enough.

14:30.078 --> 14:32.247
Suse. Suse?

14:32.289 --> 14:34.040
- Susie.
- Susie. Susie.

14:34.082 --> 14:37.502
You just--You look, like, so much better

14:37.544 --> 14:42.132
than I could have imagined
you being able to look.

14:43.425 --> 14:44.884
Uh, thank you.

14:44.926 --> 14:46.720
And it's just something about, like--

14:46.761 --> 14:50.098
Wa-wa.
Like, it's just--It's there, you know.

14:50.140 --> 14:53.602
Like, your body's just like,
"Hi. I'm here." You know?

14:53.643 --> 14:56.938
It's like--Women your age typically,
I feel like--

14:56.980 --> 15:00.150
I don't know. I think, like, shit just
gets, like, a little fucked up sometimes.

15:00.191 --> 15:02.569
You know.
And things fall, and they soften,

15:02.611 --> 15:05.030
and they droop, and they get sadder.

15:05.071 --> 15:07.282
- Yeah.
- But your body is happy

15:07.324 --> 15:09.784
and, like, more--You know?
- Bobby.

15:09.826 --> 15:11.411
- So you--
- Bobby.

15:11.453 --> 15:12.329
- You're not gross.
- Bobby.

15:12.370 --> 15:14.414
- Yeah.
- Are you 18?

15:16.499 --> 15:18.043
I'm 18 1/2.

15:19.419 --> 15:20.879
All right then.

15:21.796 --> 15:25.091
[both moaning]

15:25.133 --> 15:27.177
BOBBY: Is that a fucking plunger?

15:27.218 --> 15:28.928
SUSIE: Yeah.
You got a problem with that?

15:28.970 --> 15:30.513
BOBBY: I guess not.

15:30.555 --> 15:32.098
SUSIE: And...

15:32.140 --> 15:35.268
- BOBBY: Oh! What is that--[grunting]
- [squishing]

15:35.310 --> 15:36.311
- Susie: Yeah.
- [Bobby groaning]

15:36.353 --> 15:38.021
- SUSIE: You like that?
- BOBBY: Yeah.

15:38.063 --> 15:39.189
- You like that?
- Yeah.

15:39.230 --> 15:40.899
- Tell me you like it.
- I like it.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.317
SUSIE: Yeah, you do.

15:43.068 --> 15:44.736
MAN'S VOICE: Mazel Tov.

15:46.738 --> 15:49.282
We are fucked. We are all fucked.

15:49.324 --> 15:53.119
Calm the fuck down. It's not a big deal.
I'm, like, serious.

15:53.161 --> 15:54.746
Not a big deal?
Did you hear what she said?

15:54.788 --> 15:56.247
My life--over, done.

15:56.289 --> 15:58.958
What's the point of going over the dance?
We can't dance.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.378
Yes, you can.

16:03.713 --> 16:05.882
[whispering] You just don't know it yet.

16:05.924 --> 16:08.176
[echoing]...know it yet. ...know it yet.

16:08.218 --> 16:09.803
We appreciate the support,
but you're wrong.

16:09.844 --> 16:11.346
We can't dance. We're Jew--

16:11.388 --> 16:12.389
Jewish?

16:12.430 --> 16:14.557
Oh, you got a small pee-pee?

16:14.599 --> 16:16.976
Y'all got small pee-pees?

16:17.018 --> 16:19.646
I know it's tough.
Yeah, I got a small penis.

16:19.688 --> 16:22.357
A really small penis.
One girl, she thought it was ChapStick.

16:22.399 --> 16:24.734
But it never went on her lips.

16:24.776 --> 16:27.696
I have watched you guys grow up.

16:27.737 --> 16:29.489
I know what you're capable of.

16:29.531 --> 16:31.866
You can do this dance. Donny.
- What?

16:31.908 --> 16:33.535
Remember when you shat yourself in class?

16:33.576 --> 16:35.036
Yes, I do remember that.
It wasn't my fault.

16:35.078 --> 16:38.540
I didn't know I was lactose intolerant.
- It's okay. Shit happens.

16:38.581 --> 16:40.250
I just want you to show everybody
what it looked like

16:40.291 --> 16:42.210
when you walked out of class.
- Why?

16:42.252 --> 16:45.171
- Just show us what it looked like.
- Fine.

16:45.964 --> 16:47.257
It went something like this.

16:49.718 --> 16:51.010
[grunting]
- Yes.

16:51.052 --> 16:54.764
Yes. Yes! Capowitz.
You gave him a swirly in sixth grade.

16:54.806 --> 16:56.641
Show us what it looked like.
- Don't, dick.

16:56.683 --> 16:58.184
- Yes.
- It went like...

16:58.226 --> 17:01.354
Yes. Yes! Do you guys see what I'm
talking about here? Do you see it?

17:01.396 --> 17:03.898
Eric, get over here.
Your father's abusive, right?

17:03.940 --> 17:06.192
- Yeah!
- Yeah, he is. All right, man.

17:06.234 --> 17:09.028
Now, I want you to imagine
that you're fighting him off. All right?

17:10.363 --> 17:12.991
There it is. "Oh, no!
Daddy, don't throw me into the dresser."

17:13.032 --> 17:15.160
This is what I'm talking about, guys.

17:15.201 --> 17:17.704
Are you seeing this?
It's easy. You can do this.

17:17.746 --> 17:19.289
[pager beeping]

17:19.330 --> 17:21.750
All right, I'm getting beeped.
I gotta get out of here.

17:21.791 --> 17:24.210
But you guys are gonna be great, okay?
What are you gonna do?

17:24.252 --> 17:25.920
- Shit my pants.
- What are you gonna do?

17:25.962 --> 17:28.047
I'm gonna protect myself from my dad!

17:28.089 --> 17:29.382
We're gonna talk about that later.
What are you gonna do?

17:29.424 --> 17:31.801
- I'm gonna slam Capowitz.
- That's right.

17:31.843 --> 17:33.887
You guys get out there and do your thing.

17:33.928 --> 17:35.972
Wait. What about me?

17:36.765 --> 17:39.350
Huh. You're not Jewish.

17:39.392 --> 17:41.436
You've always known how to dance.

17:41.478 --> 17:44.898
Oh, yeah. I'm not Jewish.

17:47.317 --> 17:49.778
All right, let's do it. Come on.
We're gonna practice. Come on.

17:54.657 --> 17:58.161

18:10.381 --> 18:13.384
Earlier this evening,
we greeted the stars.

18:13.426 --> 18:15.970
Now it's time we celebrate them.

18:16.012 --> 18:17.639
Ladies and gentlemen,

18:23.478 --> 18:26.397
[ applause ]

18:26.439 --> 18:29.025
Hello, everyone. Uh...

18:31.861 --> 18:34.656
I'd like to thank you all
for making it out here tonight,

18:34.697 --> 18:38.409
and I'd like to officially welcome you
to the first ever Donny Awards.

18:38.451 --> 18:43.122
[cheering]

18:43.164 --> 18:46.543
They say that the older you become,
the wiser you get.

18:46.584 --> 18:49.504
And grandparents are amazing.
We can all agree on that.

18:49.546 --> 18:51.756
But who is the most amazing?

18:51.798 --> 18:54.843
Nominees for Best Grandparent are...

18:54.884 --> 18:56.261
Bubbie.

18:59.222 --> 19:00.890

Zadie. Come on. Give it up.

19:08.481 --> 19:10.775
Or Pep Pep.

19:10.817 --> 19:12.318

19:12.360 --> 19:14.946
And the award goes to...

19:14.988 --> 19:17.866
[drumroll]

19:17.907 --> 19:20.201
Grandma Stein.

19:20.243 --> 19:22.537
[applause]

19:22.579 --> 19:26.708
Just start moving her. She'll wake up.

19:26.749 --> 19:28.710
Honey, I need to go to the bathroom.

19:28.751 --> 19:30.169
Right now? Can it wait?

19:30.211 --> 19:31.921
It's kind of an emergency.

19:31.963 --> 19:34.799
The turtle's starting to poke its head
out of the shell.

19:34.841 --> 19:36.843
Whatever. This is so typical.

19:36.885 --> 19:38.887
GERALD: One more round of applause
for Grandma.

19:38.928 --> 19:40.680

- Yeah.

19:42.056 --> 19:44.559
I'm the Best Grandma.

19:44.601 --> 19:46.394
Oh, my.

19:46.436 --> 19:51.566
I am so proud to see you up here
becoming a man, watching you--

19:51.608 --> 19:53.568
Okay, thank you, Grandma.
You talk too much.

19:53.610 --> 19:55.695
Hey, we gotta keep this show rolling.

19:55.737 --> 19:57.697
Thank you, Grandma Stein.
Thank you. Thank you.

19:57.739 --> 19:59.908
We ain't got time for all of that.
All right.

19:59.949 --> 20:02.702
The next category...

20:02.744 --> 20:04.954
is Favorite Cousin.

20:04.996 --> 20:09.250
[applause]

20:09.292 --> 20:12.253
Oh. I'm so sorry. I didn't realize
anybody else would be out here.

20:12.295 --> 20:13.838
I can leave.
- No.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.173
No. it's--it's fine.

20:15.214 --> 20:17.884
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely. It's fine.

20:21.137 --> 20:24.265
- It's a beautiful night.
- Yeah. Yeah. It sure is.

20:26.309 --> 20:28.394
Have we met?

20:28.436 --> 20:29.395
Really, Mitch?

20:29.437 --> 20:32.565
Our children have been going
to school together for quite some time.

20:32.607 --> 20:33.691
I'm Hannah's mum.

20:33.733 --> 20:35.735
Oh, right. Right.

20:35.777 --> 20:39.364
Hannah's mom. Right. I'm-I'm sorry.
I'm terrible with names.

20:39.405 --> 20:41.741
- All right. That's fine.
- Yeah.

20:41.783 --> 20:44.202
Smoking during the ceremony.
That's pretty bad of you.

20:44.243 --> 20:46.996
Oh, yeah. Got me.
Can you keep a secret?

20:47.038 --> 20:48.790
Well, that depends. Can I join in?

20:48.831 --> 20:50.959
Uh, yeah. Sure. Of course.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.335

I have bad news about the giveaways.

30:32.248 --> 30:33.332
What?

30:33.374 --> 30:37.211
Well, you wanted gold statues,
and they are not gold.

30:37.253 --> 30:38.837
They are a shiny purple.

30:38.879 --> 30:40.798
Okay, well, that's upsetting
and unfortunate,

30:40.839 --> 30:42.216
but, you know, I'll manage.

30:42.258 --> 30:46.303
Yes, but also the, uh, material,
they're not made of metal.

30:46.345 --> 30:49.848
It's actually more of, like,
a, uh--a rubberish.

30:49.890 --> 30:51.267
Well, that's strange.

30:51.308 --> 30:53.811
I mean, look, as long as they're
functional, I'm sure it's fine, you know.

30:53.852 --> 30:56.855
The kids are young. They're not gonna
really care what I give them.

30:56.897 --> 31:00.234
Yeah, but, you know,
I think when it was being transported,

31:00.276 --> 31:01.485
the heat...
- Mm-hmm.

31:01.527 --> 31:07.616
...must have affected
the structural, um, foundation

31:07.658 --> 31:08.993
of the rubber.

31:09.034 --> 31:10.744
And also, there's, like--
They're attached to the hats.

31:10.786 --> 31:13.289
Okay, just shut up
and show me the damn things.

31:13.330 --> 31:15.082
