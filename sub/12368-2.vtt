11:13.798 --> 11:17.635
IF YOU WERE MY WOMAN, I'D NEVER
LEAVE YOU FOR A SHRIMP BAR.

11:21.514 --> 11:25.226
- OKAY.

11:25.309 --> 11:28.312
- AHOY, CAPTAIN.

11:28.396 --> 11:30.064
- OH, THANK GOD YOU'RE HERE.

11:30.147 --> 11:31.273
CAROLINE'S GIRLFRIEND
JUST HIT ON ME.

11:31.357 --> 11:33.275
HIT ON ME--
I NEED A PLAN.

11:33.359 --> 11:34.610
- JUST TELL YOUR SISTER
THE TRUTH.

11:34.693 --> 11:37.113
SHE'LL UNDERSTAND.
NOW OFF YOU GO.

11:37.196 --> 11:39.240
- I KNOW, BUT WHAT IF SHE HATES
ME FOR PRETENDING TO BE GAY?

11:39.323 --> 11:40.658
I DON'T WANT IT
TO SEPARATE US AGAIN.

11:40.741 --> 11:42.284
- THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE
TO TELL HER NOW

11:42.368 --> 11:43.994
BEFORE IT GETS OUT OF HAND.

11:44.078 --> 11:45.663
GOOD?
GOOD.

11:45.746 --> 11:46.956
- OKAY, THANKS, JOY.
YOU'RE A REALLY GOOD FRIEND.

11:47.039 --> 11:49.792
- YEAH, YEAH.

11:49.875 --> 11:50.584
[knocking at door]

11:56.048 --> 11:58.134
AHOY, CAPTAIN.

12:03.055 --> 12:04.473
OH, YOUR BEARD IS SO ROUGH.

12:04.557 --> 12:06.142
- SHOULD I SHAVE?
- NO.

12:06.225 --> 12:10.312
I LIKE IT ROUGH.

12:10.396 --> 12:12.815
- JOY, ARE YOU IN THERE?
I FORGOT MY KEY.

12:12.898 --> 12:17.027
- DAMN!
IN THERE, QUICK.

12:22.241 --> 12:23.659
- HERE YOU ARE.

12:23.742 --> 12:25.035
NOW OFF YOU GO BEFORE
YOU MISS YOUR MASSAGE.

12:25.119 --> 12:26.996
- YEAH, I THINK I DID MISS IT.

12:27.079 --> 12:30.291
I JUST CAN'T FIGURE OUT THIS
WHOLE NAUTICAL TIME THING.

12:30.374 --> 12:33.210
AND THEN ELKA RAN INTO ME AND
SPILLED CHOCOLATE RANCH DRESSING

12:33.294 --> 12:34.545
ALL OVER MY BLOUSE.

12:34.628 --> 12:36.755
SO NOW I HAVE TO RINSE IT OUT.
- NO!

12:45.389 --> 12:47.016
EVERYTHING RINSING PROPERLY?

12:47.099 --> 12:50.978
- YEAH, I'LL BE OUT
IN A SECOND.

12:51.061 --> 12:52.480
[gasps]

12:52.563 --> 12:56.859
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
ARE--

12:56.942 --> 12:58.652
- I COULDN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU
SO I SNUCK IN.

12:58.736 --> 13:00.571
WHEN I HEARD YOUR WIFE COMING,
I HID.

13:00.654 --> 13:02.448
- SO YOU BROKE INTO MY CABIN,

13:02.531 --> 13:04.700
AND NOW YOU'RE HIDING
IN MY SHOWER?

13:04.783 --> 13:07.912
IN A LESS SEXY MAN,
THAT WOULD BE CREEPY.

13:07.995 --> 13:10.206
- YOU HAVE TO GET
RID OF YOUR WIFE.

13:10.289 --> 13:11.207
I'LL MEET YOU LATER.

13:11.290 --> 13:12.500
- FINE.
WHAT TIME?

13:12.583 --> 13:14.210
- SIX BELLS ON THE DOG WATCH?

13:14.293 --> 13:15.169
- WHEN?
- 1900 HOURS?

13:15.252 --> 13:16.712
- WHAT?

13:16.795 --> 13:20.174
- JUST FIND ME LATER.
I'LL MAKE TIME.

13:20.257 --> 13:22.051
[moaning]

13:22.134 --> 13:24.512
- [sighs]

13:33.521 --> 13:35.731
THERE.
THAT FELT GOOD.

13:35.814 --> 13:40.236
YOU KNOW,
TO GET THE STAIN OUT.

13:40.319 --> 13:41.403
- NOW TO YOUR MASSAGE?

13:41.487 --> 13:42.613
- OH, I HAVE AN IDEA.

13:42.696 --> 13:44.073
UM, WHY DON'T YOU TAKE MINE?

13:44.156 --> 13:45.574
- OH, I'M GOOD.

13:45.658 --> 13:48.744
MAYBE YOU COULD DO
ANOTHER ACTIVITY?

13:48.827 --> 13:50.246
POTTERY MIGHT TAKE
A LONG TIME.

13:50.329 --> 13:52.414
- OR, OR YOU COULD DO
AN ACTIVITY.

13:52.498 --> 13:53.707
- OR WE COULD DO ONE TOGETHER.

13:53.791 --> 13:55.584
- OH, GREAT.

13:55.668 --> 13:59.255
LET'S BOTH GO DO SOME
GAY ACTIVITY TOGETHER.

13:59.338 --> 14:02.049
- [chuckles]

14:02.132 --> 14:03.634
OH, UH, HOLD THE ELEVATOR.

14:03.717 --> 14:07.805
I JUST WANT TO
GET MY EARRINGS.

14:10.474 --> 14:11.392
DID SHE SEE YOU?

14:11.475 --> 14:12.810
- OF COURSE NOT.

14:12.893 --> 14:13.894
- [sighs in relief]
LET'S MEET AGAIN, LATER.

14:13.978 --> 14:15.521
- EIGHT BELLS
ON THE DOG WATCH?

14:15.604 --> 14:16.397
- IS THAT AT THE FRONT
OF THE BOAT?

14:16.480 --> 14:19.984
- JUST FIND ME.

14:32.246 --> 14:33.497
- OH, CAPTAIN LEBEAU.

14:33.581 --> 14:34.832
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

14:34.915 --> 14:38.627
OH, EXECUTIVE CAPTAIN
TURN-DOWN SERVICE.

14:38.711 --> 14:43.799
- I'VE HEARD OF IT.

14:43.882 --> 14:48.053
DO YOU THINK, MAYBE, YOU COULD
DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT FOR ME?

14:51.432 --> 14:54.977
- UM, I'M SO SORRY.

14:55.060 --> 14:58.564
I REALLY HAVE TO
DRAW THE LINE SOMEWHERE.

15:02.693 --> 15:04.403
- YOU'RE STRAIGHT.

15:10.743 --> 15:12.328
- I CAN EXPLAIN.

15:12.411 --> 15:14.038
- WHAT'S TO EXPLAIN?
YOU'RE NOT GAY.

15:14.121 --> 15:15.164
CAN'T BELIEVE YOU WOULD LIE
TO ME LIKE THAT.

15:15.247 --> 15:16.498
- NO, NO.
DON'T GO.

15:16.582 --> 15:18.751
I--I HAD TO LIE
TO GET ON THIS CRUISE,

15:18.834 --> 15:22.338
BUT THEN, WHEN I SAW HOW HAPPY
YOU WERE, I KEPT IT UP,

15:22.421 --> 15:24.840
BECAUSE, WELL,
YOU WERE SO HAPPY.

15:24.923 --> 15:27.885
- BECAUSE I THOUGHT WE FINALLY
HAD SOMETHING IN COMMON.

15:27.968 --> 15:30.012
- WE DO!
WE GREW UP IN THE SAME HOUSE.

15:30.095 --> 15:31.472
WE HAD THE SAME
CRAZY PARENTS.

15:31.555 --> 15:33.515
I ALWAYS WANTED
TO BE CLOSER TO YOU,

15:33.599 --> 15:36.143
BUT YOU'D NEVER
LET ME IN.

15:36.226 --> 15:37.353
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
YOU WERE GAY?

15:37.436 --> 15:39.480
- OH, YOU WOULDN'T
UNDERSTAND.

15:39.563 --> 15:44.985
- TRY ME.
[sighs]

15:45.069 --> 15:47.029
- WHEN YOU'RE A KID,
AND YOU REALIZE YOU'RE GAY,

15:47.112 --> 15:48.864
YOU AUTOMATICALLY
HAVE A SECRET,

15:48.947 --> 15:54.703
AND THAT MAKES YOU FEEL
DIFFERENT FROM EVERYONE ELSE.

15:54.787 --> 15:58.874
AND IT'S EVEN HARDER WHEN YOUR
SISTER IS "LITTLE MISS ANGEL."

15:58.957 --> 16:02.961
- I DID NOT ASK MOM
TO MAKE ME THAT MUG.

16:05.255 --> 16:09.093
- MY MUG SAID, "WOULD IT
KILL YOU TO WEAR A DRESS?"

16:11.845 --> 16:13.222
- I'M SORRY.

16:13.305 --> 16:14.390
IT MUST HAVE BEEN
REALLY HARD.

16:14.473 --> 16:15.557
- YEAH, IT WAS.

16:15.641 --> 16:16.892
AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
REALLY NICE

16:16.975 --> 16:18.018
TO BE ABLE TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT IT.

16:18.102 --> 16:19.728
- AND YOU COULD HAVE.

16:19.812 --> 16:21.730
- BUT I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

16:21.814 --> 16:23.899
AND MAYBE I WAS SCARED.

16:23.982 --> 16:25.275
- SCARED OF WHAT?

16:25.359 --> 16:27.277
- SCARED YOU'D THINK
I WAS WEIRD.

16:27.361 --> 16:28.529
SCARED THAT YOU'D TELL
MOM AND DAD.

16:28.612 --> 16:30.698
YOU KNOW THEY WOULD FREAK.

16:30.781 --> 16:32.616
SO I JUST PUT UP THIS WALL,

16:32.700 --> 16:37.913
AND THEN I GOT USED TO LIVING
BEHIND THE WALL.

16:37.996 --> 16:39.248
- WELL, FOR THE RECORD,

16:39.331 --> 16:41.583
I WOULDN'T HAVE THOUGHT
YOU WERE WEIRD.

16:41.667 --> 16:44.545
AND I NEVER WOULD HAVE TOLD
MOM AND DAD.

16:44.628 --> 16:46.088
WELL, UNLESS MOM GAVE ME
THAT LOOK,

16:46.171 --> 16:48.882
AND I WOULD HAVE SPILLED
EVERYTHING.

16:48.966 --> 16:52.094
- YOU ARE A SPILLER.

16:52.177 --> 16:53.512
AND THEN I WOULDN'T
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HAVE

16:53.595 --> 16:55.472
SLEEPOVERS
WITH MY GIRLFRIENDS.

17:01.520 --> 17:03.105
- JULIE BARNETT?
- OH, YEAH.

17:03.188 --> 17:07.025
- YOU SCORED A CHEERLEADER!
- [laughs]

17:07.108 --> 17:09.278
- WOW.

17:09.361 --> 17:11.571
I ALWAYS WANTED THIS.

17:11.655 --> 17:14.157
- ME TOO.

17:14.241 --> 17:15.325
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY?

17:15.409 --> 17:16.952
NEW BEGINNINGS?

17:17.035 --> 17:19.621
- SURE.

17:19.704 --> 17:21.415
- SO WHAT DO YOU THINK OF NAN?

17:21.498 --> 17:24.126
- OH, YEAH. SHE'S GOOD,
SHE'S GREAT.

17:24.209 --> 17:25.752
SUPER FUN.

17:25.836 --> 17:26.753
- 'CAUSE I'M THINKING
OF BREAKING UP WITH HER.

17:26.837 --> 17:31.300
- DUMP HER.
DUMP HER NOW.

17:31.383 --> 17:33.135
SO HOW DID NAN TAKE IT?

17:33.218 --> 17:36.680
- WELL, SHE'S MAD AT ME,
BUT IT'S REALLY WEIRD.

17:36.764 --> 17:38.849
SHE KEPT SAYING HOW SHE HOPED

17:38.932 --> 17:40.684
THE TWO OF <i> YOU</i> COULD
STILL BE FRIENDS.

17:46.940 --> 17:48.317
- [woman over p.a.]
LADIES AND LADIES,

17:48.400 --> 17:49.818
TAKE YOUR SEATS.

17:49.902 --> 17:52.321
VICTORIA CHASE'S TALK,
"A JOURNEY TO JOY:

17:52.404 --> 17:57.326
MY SEXUAL AWAKENING AT THE HANDS
OF A MIDDLE-AGED LESBIAN."

17:57.409 --> 17:59.995
- DOUCETTE FRERES, DOUCETTE
FRERES, DOUCETTE FRERES.

18:00.078 --> 18:01.455
- JOY, WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOUR FACE?

18:01.538 --> 18:02.664
IT'S ALL RED.

18:02.748 --> 18:04.208
- NO, IT ISN'T!
IS IT?

18:04.291 --> 18:06.293
- IT LOOKS SCOURED.

18:06.376 --> 18:08.712
IS THAT BEARD BURN?

18:08.796 --> 18:14.009
- JOY, GOT A LITTLE CAPTAIN
IN YOU?

18:14.092 --> 18:15.677
- WHAT?
HE TURNED ME DOWN!

18:15.761 --> 18:16.678
- IS IT REALLY THAT BAD?

18:16.762 --> 18:18.055
I TRIED TO COVER IT UP.

18:18.138 --> 18:22.142
I BETTER GO AND PUT ON
SOME MORE MAKEUP.

18:25.103 --> 18:27.356
VICTORIA, WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE OUT THERE.

18:27.439 --> 18:29.358
- OH, I WAS JUST APPLYING
A LITTLE MORE MAKEUP.

18:29.441 --> 18:30.692
- WHY ARE YOU COVERING
YOUR CHIN?

18:30.776 --> 18:33.987
- I'M...
THINKING DEEP THOUGHTS.

18:34.071 --> 18:35.489
WHY ARE YOU COVERING
YOUR CHIN?

18:35.572 --> 18:38.700
- I WAS THINKING, "WHY IS SHE
THINKING DEEP THOUGHTS?"

18:38.784 --> 18:41.370
- YOU'VE BEEN WITH THE CAPTAIN.
- YOU'VE BEEN WITH THE CAPTAIN.

18:41.453 --> 18:43.080
- I COULDN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.
WHAT'S YOUR EXCUSE?

18:43.163 --> 18:45.124
- OH, HE TRICKED ME
WITH HIS GOOD LOOKS.

18:45.207 --> 18:46.333
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
HE PLAYED US BOTH.

18:46.416 --> 18:47.709
- OH, I CAN'T BELIEVE IT,
EITHER.

18:47.793 --> 18:49.336
YOU KNOW, IF I WERE YOU,

18:49.419 --> 18:51.046
I WOULD JUST AVOID HIM
FOR THE REST OF THE TRIP.

18:51.129 --> 18:52.339
- YOU JUST WANT HIM
FOR YOURSELF!

18:52.422 --> 18:54.216
- YEAH, WELL, I NEED HIM MORE
THAN YOU DO.

18:54.299 --> 18:55.843
[on speaker]
THE STRAIN OF PRETENDING

18:55.926 --> 18:58.512
TO BE A CELEBRITY LESBIAN
IS EXHAUSTING.

18:58.595 --> 19:01.056
- [chuckles]

19:01.139 --> 19:03.016
- MY PHONE, MY PHONE!

19:03.100 --> 19:04.726
- ESPECIALLY BEING
THE FEMME ONE.

19:04.810 --> 19:06.019
- BUT I'M THE FEMME ONE.

19:06.103 --> 19:07.563
- OH, PLEASE.
WITH THOSE HANDS?

19:07.646 --> 19:10.232
- THESE HANDS WERE THE ONES
THAT OPENED YOU UP SEXUALLY,

19:10.315 --> 19:12.776
ACCORDING TO THAT BOGUS TALK
YOU'RE ABOUT TO GIVE.

19:12.860 --> 19:15.779
[cell phone vibrating]

19:15.863 --> 19:17.739
- "YOUR MIC IS ON.

19:17.823 --> 19:23.412
THE L-WORDS CAN HEAR
EVERYTHING."

19:23.495 --> 19:24.913
OH, BABY GIRL.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.665
WHY DON'T YOU
COME ON OVER HERE,

19:26.748 --> 19:29.167
AND LET MAMA GIVE YOU
SOME SUGAR, HUH?

19:29.251 --> 19:32.004
- DO YOU KNOW ANY LESBIANS?

19:38.051 --> 19:39.136
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
FINE, FINE.

19:39.219 --> 19:41.597
IT'S OVER.
I AM NOT GAY.

19:41.680 --> 19:44.600
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO JUMP-START MY CAREER.

19:44.683 --> 19:47.311
AND WHILE ALL OF YOUR CAMERAS
ARE ROLLING,

19:47.394 --> 19:51.273
I-I WOULD LIKE TO APOLOGIZE
TO EVERYONE HERE.

19:51.356 --> 19:54.234
AND TO THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN
DECEIVED,

19:54.318 --> 19:59.239
IN THIS WHOLE MISGUIDED FAKE
GAY MARRIAGE ESCAPADE,

19:59.323 --> 20:04.453
AND ESPECIALLY TO MY DEAR FRIEND
AND SOON TO BE EX-WIFE, JOY.

20:04.536 --> 20:06.121
YOU KNOW,
OF ALL MY EX-SPOUSES,

20:06.204 --> 20:09.458
YOU TRULY ARE THE MOST
SUPPORTIVE AND UNDERSTANDING.

20:09.541 --> 20:11.501
- I'M STILL KEEPING
THE DOUCETTE FRERES.

20:11.585 --> 20:13.337
- OVER MY DEAD BODY!

20:13.420 --> 20:15.088
- I'LL SEE YOU IN COURT!

20:15.172 --> 20:16.757
- YOU KNOW, THIS MARRIAGE
WAS NEVER CONSUMMATED,

20:16.840 --> 20:19.593
SO YOU ARE GONNA GET NOTHING
AND LIKE IT.

20:22.221 --> 20:24.473
[faint arguing]

20:24.556 --> 20:26.934
- YOU KNOW, THERE'S
A MARITIME SUPERSTITION

20:27.017 --> 20:29.186
THAT IT'S BAD LUCK FOR A CAPTAIN
TO ROMANCE JUST TWO WOMEN

20:29.269 --> 20:30.812
ON A SHIP.

20:30.896 --> 20:32.481
IT'S CALLED
"THE RULE OF THREE."

20:32.564 --> 20:35.400
- I'VE HEARD OF IT.
