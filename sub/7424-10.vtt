00:02.933 --> 00:05.268
Basically, the animal
nucleotides are taking over

00:05.270 --> 00:06.585
from the human ones.

00:06.587 --> 00:08.154
<i>And whatever it is...</i>

00:08.156 --> 00:09.572
it's changing.

00:09.574 --> 00:11.407
CATHERINE: <i>He's becoming</i>
<i>less human.</i>

00:11.409 --> 00:14.277
He says it's mutating;
becoming more animal.

00:14.279 --> 00:15.828
I should probably go.

00:17.114 --> 00:19.031
Heather, uh...
I need your keys.

00:19.033 --> 00:21.801
I need to go and find somebody.

01:00.540 --> 01:04.360
HEATHER: Is that her?
Is that Cat?

01:04.361 --> 01:05.527
Stay in the car.

01:05.529 --> 01:07.496
HEATHER:
Wait! Evan...!

(growls softly)

NYPD!

01:14.339 --> 01:16.339
Who's out there?

01:22.846 --> 01:25.181
Cat... Cat, can you hear me?

01:25.183 --> 01:28.734
Oh, my God...
Oh, my God.

01:32.222 --> 01:33.555
Heather, I need you!

01:36.326 --> 01:38.744
HEATHER (crying):
Cat...!

01:39.729 --> 01:41.113
Oh, my God!

01:41.115 --> 01:42.531
Oh, my God! Is she okay?

01:42.533 --> 01:45.117
She is bleeding
everywhere.

01:45.119 --> 01:46.952
That's the least of her problems.
She's barely breathing.

01:46.954 --> 01:48.348
What?!

01:48.373 --> 01:49.956
Decreased inhalation
on the right side.

01:50.415 --> 01:51.660
Well, then get
her to a hospital.

01:51.661 --> 01:53.661
She won't make it to a hospital.
Her lung is collapsing.

01:53.663 --> 01:55.463
I need you to go
back to the car,

01:55.465 --> 01:57.515
get that flask of
vodka that you had.

01:57.517 --> 01:59.166
I need a knife, and a glove,
and a rubber band.

01:59.168 --> 02:01.669
Okay...

02:01.671 --> 02:04.305
You're going to be
all right, okay?

02:04.307 --> 02:05.339
Just hang in there.

02:05.341 --> 02:07.675
Just stay with me,
all right?

02:09.695 --> 02:10.862
(car door shuts)

02:14.483 --> 02:15.733
Come on, Heather!

02:17.870 --> 02:19.203
Here, here, here.

02:19.205 --> 02:20.989
Great. That's great.
Well done.

02:20.991 --> 02:22.740
Okay...
Okay, this is the compress.

02:22.742 --> 02:24.158
Give me your hand. Give it here.
What?!

02:24.160 --> 02:26.377
Put pressure on it,
and hold down.

02:26.379 --> 02:27.795
Keep holding it down.

02:27.797 --> 02:30.164
Okay.
We can't let any more air get in.

02:30.166 --> 02:32.366
I think I saw something
in the trees.

02:33.836 --> 02:35.503
There's nothing out there.

02:35.505 --> 02:38.006
Just stay focused, okay?

02:38.008 --> 02:40.174
Everything's
going to be fine.

02:40.176 --> 02:42.543
(crying)

02:42.545 --> 02:45.713
You're doing great;
just keep that pressure on.

02:45.715 --> 02:47.648
I'm going to replace that
with this glove, all right?

02:47.650 --> 02:49.017
Now keep the
pressure down on that.

02:59.394 --> 03:00.695
Okay...

03:08.954 --> 03:11.255
Wha-wha...?
Trust me.

03:11.257 --> 03:12.073
(puncturing)

03:18.547 --> 03:20.748
Okay, Heather.
Breathe.

03:22.217 --> 03:24.218
(labored gasp)

03:25.521 --> 03:27.055
Breathe...

03:28.423 --> 03:30.758
That's it.
That's it.

03:32.811 --> 03:34.529
That's it.
(anxious sigh)

03:34.531 --> 03:36.931
(weak exhale)

03:37.816 --> 03:39.200
She's going to be fine.

03:39.202 --> 03:41.202
Okay, you need to
call 911, tell them

03:41.204 --> 03:43.704
you have an officer down
with a bullet wound, okay?

03:43.706 --> 03:45.773
We need a Medevac to
New York General immediately.

03:47.726 --> 03:51.779
(weak, labored breathing)

03:51.781 --> 03:54.248
Just keep breathing.

03:54.250 --> 03:56.451
(siren wails in distance)

03:57.419 --> 04:00.088
(siren continues,
getting closer)

04:19.992 --> 04:21.976
NURSE (distant, echoing):
Hey, you're awake.

04:21.978 --> 04:24.612
(echoing fades): Don't worry...
it's all going to be fine.

04:25.447 --> 04:28.916
I have... no idea where I am.

04:28.918 --> 04:30.835
New York General.

04:30.837 --> 04:33.304
You were
Medevac'd in last night.

04:34.790 --> 04:36.557
First-timer, I take it.

04:37.876 --> 04:40.511
Well, I called and said
the other bed was broken,

04:40.513 --> 04:42.797
so you could have
some peace and quiet.

04:42.799 --> 04:44.765
Thank you.

04:44.767 --> 04:47.301
Don't really need any
crazy roommates right now.

04:47.303 --> 04:51.622
Speaking of, um...
have you seen my sister?

04:51.624 --> 04:53.691
A small version of you,
teetering around on heels,

04:53.693 --> 04:54.775
reeking of vodka?

04:54.777 --> 04:56.611
Sounds about right.

04:56.613 --> 04:58.312
She wouldn't
leave your side.

04:58.314 --> 05:00.848
I finally gave her a
banana bag for her hangover

05:00.850 --> 05:02.483
and sent her home to sleep.

05:04.620 --> 05:06.520
You did great in surgery.

05:06.522 --> 05:08.105
Both of them.

05:08.107 --> 05:10.458
Both?
What are you talking about?

05:10.460 --> 05:14.145
The police said you crawled out
of a mangled car.

05:14.147 --> 05:17.048
Apparently, some do-gooder
doctor found you,

05:17.050 --> 05:19.550
performed a needle thoracostomy
on you in the field,

05:19.552 --> 05:21.002
with a pocket knife.

05:21.004 --> 05:23.838
If it wasn't for him,
you'd be dead.

05:26.675 --> 05:29.427
And I'm guessing from that
look, you know who he is.

05:30.879 --> 05:32.563
He must be special.

05:32.565 --> 05:34.682
And then some.

05:34.684 --> 05:38.920
I had someone like that once.

05:42.774 --> 05:44.859
(sighing): And as much
as I'd like to over-share,

05:44.861 --> 05:46.160
I have rounds.

05:46.162 --> 05:48.079
Um, the doctor
will be in shortly.

05:48.081 --> 05:49.413
Hang in there.

05:49.415 --> 05:50.865
Thanks.

05:53.168 --> 05:55.402
(phone vibrating, buzzing)

06:04.263 --> 06:06.764
TESS (over phone):
Cat, I'm so sorry.

06:06.766 --> 06:08.432
I just got the message.

06:08.434 --> 06:10.268
I should have
been there for you.

06:10.270 --> 06:13.754
I'm on my way now with John
Hughes movies and Red Vines.

06:18.143 --> 06:19.360
Vincent.

06:19.362 --> 06:23.097
What if someone sees you?

06:23.099 --> 06:24.949
Playing doctor is
kind of in my wheelhouse.

06:25.984 --> 06:28.602
Besides, I, uh...

06:30.322 --> 06:31.789
I needed to see you.

06:32.874 --> 06:35.009
Thank you.

06:35.011 --> 06:37.278
My nurse told me about that
procedure you did.

06:37.280 --> 06:39.297
Yeah, uh, about that...

06:39.299 --> 06:42.233
The amazing roadside save.

06:42.235 --> 06:43.918
Catherine, uh...

06:43.920 --> 06:45.553
Vincent,
I'm alive because of you.

06:45.555 --> 06:47.571
It wasn't me.

06:47.573 --> 06:51.792
It was, uh,
it was Evan, actually.

06:51.794 --> 06:54.578
I, uh, I just ripped the car
door off, I got you out,

06:54.580 --> 06:58.316
and, I wanted to stay,
uh, to help.

06:58.318 --> 07:03.638
But, I just... I couldn't, you
know, get back to... being me.

07:03.640 --> 07:07.308
And, uh, Evan pulled up,
so I had to make a choice.

07:07.310 --> 07:09.277
He was your best option.

07:09.279 --> 07:12.280
You still saved my life.

07:12.282 --> 07:14.282
If you hadn't got me
out of that car,

07:14.284 --> 07:17.501
Evan never would have
gotten to me in time.

07:17.503 --> 07:20.571
Well, if he hadn't shown
up though, then what?

07:20.573 --> 07:25.042
Sure, I can pull a car door off,
but you needed a doctor and...

07:26.628 --> 07:28.629
I couldn't help you,
you know.

07:28.631 --> 07:33.217
In that moment, all I could do
was... watch you slip away.

07:39.191 --> 07:42.276
You know,
I thought that I lost you.

07:42.278 --> 07:45.813
You didn't lose me.

07:45.815 --> 07:48.582
I'm right here.

07:50.185 --> 07:56.574
And... I accept
all of what you are.

07:56.576 --> 07:58.626
That's what I was
coming to tell you.

07:58.628 --> 08:00.044
I was driving
into the city.

08:00.046 --> 08:02.296
Even though
your DNA is changing,

08:02.298 --> 08:06.317
that doesn't have to change
things between us.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.336
You know you say that now,

08:08.338 --> 08:11.856
but just wait until I sprout
whiskers and a tail.

08:11.858 --> 08:14.041
(phone beeping)

08:18.347 --> 08:19.513
Um...

08:19.515 --> 08:20.898
It's Evan.

08:20.900 --> 08:23.267
He's on his way up.

08:23.269 --> 08:25.403
You know
if I could stay, I would.

08:25.405 --> 08:28.022
I know you would.

08:30.192 --> 08:31.859
Uh...

08:33.160 --> 08:34.662
You should
probably know that Evan

08:34.664 --> 08:36.746
might have seen me
on the road last night.

08:38.450 --> 08:40.251
(whispers):
Okay.

08:43.455 --> 08:45.572

Bye.

10:04.538 --> 10:08.124
Cocky grin, bit of
a swagger, flowers...

10:08.126 --> 10:10.408
Someone's feeling good
about themselves.

10:10.409 --> 10:11.608
Just thinking
about how much you owe me

10:11.610 --> 10:12.826
for saving your life.

10:12.828 --> 10:15.279
Didn't I just save <i>your</i> life?

10:15.281 --> 10:17.114
Wasn't that you
a couple weeks ago...

10:17.116 --> 10:18.782
psycho subway killer?

10:18.784 --> 10:22.636
Yeah, the statute of limitations
on that expired days ago.

10:22.638 --> 10:24.705
Did it?

10:28.126 --> 10:29.793
Thank you.

10:32.297 --> 10:34.848
I couldn't lose you.

10:34.850 --> 10:40.337
So, you are a roadside surgeon.

10:42.607 --> 10:45.142
You know, if I could make
six figures a year doing that,

10:45.144 --> 10:49.396
I would not be in a basement
cutting open dead people.

10:53.785 --> 10:58.372
And, the way that you pulled me
out of Heather's car...

10:59.491 --> 11:02.042
Pulled you out?

11:02.044 --> 11:04.661
No, I just bravely slammed
on the brakes,

11:04.663 --> 11:06.246
so I didn't flatten you.

11:08.316 --> 11:12.920
So, I was... already on the
roadway when you found me?

11:12.922 --> 11:16.890
Yeah, you must have crawled out
before you lost consciousness.

11:16.892 --> 11:20.894
You did lose a hell
of a lot of blood.

11:22.931 --> 11:26.984
So, I guess I'm a living,
breathing miracle.

11:26.986 --> 11:30.437
You are to me.

11:33.691 --> 11:35.392
Could I...?

11:35.394 --> 11:36.944
Yeah, of course,
um, do you thing.

11:36.946 --> 11:38.152
Uh, I'll check back
with you later.

11:38.177 --> 11:39.319
Okay.

11:40.282 --> 11:43.367
Uh, it's not something wrong
with my X-ray, is it?

11:43.369 --> 11:44.868
Oh, no. No, no.

11:44.870 --> 11:47.337
Everything's...
everything's fine with you.

11:47.339 --> 11:50.407
Um, weird question:

11:50.409 --> 11:52.926
The doctor that came
in here earlier,

11:52.928 --> 11:55.229
do you know him?

11:55.231 --> 11:59.133
I don't know which doctor
you're talking about.

11:59.135 --> 12:01.552
He's tall, um, he was
wearing a lab coat,

12:01.554 --> 12:03.103
had a scar on his face.

12:03.105 --> 12:06.106
Another nurse saw him
walk out of your room.

12:06.108 --> 12:09.460
Uh, yeah, a doctor did come
in here to check my chart.

12:09.462 --> 12:12.196
I didn't recognize
him though. Why?

12:12.198 --> 12:13.930
(sighs)

12:16.534 --> 12:18.035
Still cool to over-share?

12:18.037 --> 12:20.537
Always.

12:20.539 --> 12:26.043
I know this is going to...
sound crazy, but...

12:26.045 --> 12:30.981
the doctor I saw is
supposed to be dead.

12:32.717 --> 12:35.419
It was Vincent Keller.

12:46.815 --> 12:48.632
Hey.

12:48.634 --> 12:51.819
So, I've been thinking,
maybe you're mutating DNA

12:51.821 --> 12:53.904
could be another
evolutionary step.

12:53.906 --> 12:57.491
Like, a-a new manimal ability
breaking through.

12:57.493 --> 12:59.326
Anything physical changing?

12:59.328 --> 13:01.078
I don't know, man, I guess.

13:01.080 --> 13:03.580
My eyes have
been playing up on me.

13:03.582 --> 13:06.166
Probably just allergies,
but who knows.

13:06.168 --> 13:08.368
We can't really predict
how you'll evolve.

13:08.370 --> 13:11.255
Maybe you'll change
genders like a clown fish.

13:11.257 --> 13:13.257
(laughs)

13:13.259 --> 13:15.008
Come on, that was a joke.

13:15.010 --> 13:17.110
Yeah...

13:17.112 --> 13:19.680
What?

13:19.682 --> 13:22.432
I saw Alex today.

13:22.434 --> 13:25.636
Alex Salter?

13:25.638 --> 13:28.188
Yeah, I didn't talk to her,
I just, I ran, you know.

13:28.190 --> 13:29.723
Like I did ten years ago.

13:29.725 --> 13:34.211
You have to stop beating
yourself up, man.

13:34.213 --> 13:37.030
You know, I never
got to say good-bye and...

13:37.032 --> 13:40.067
I never even reached
out when I got back.

13:40.069 --> 13:42.018
And you had a damn good reason.

13:42.020 --> 13:43.704
Muirfield was hunting you.

13:43.706 --> 13:45.489
If they found you
anywhere near her, they'd--

13:45.491 --> 13:47.691
No, you're right,
you're right.

13:47.693 --> 13:51.478
I never wanted her
involved in any of this.

13:52.497 --> 13:53.897
The return of reason?

13:53.899 --> 13:55.315
Mm-hmm.

13:55.317 --> 13:57.251
(laughs)
My favorite part.

13:57.253 --> 14:00.337
I was actually off the campus
to get some of my own.

14:00.339 --> 14:02.055
Sarah's an
earth sciences professor,

14:02.057 --> 14:03.540
emphasis in evolution.

14:03.542 --> 14:05.559
Sarah...!

14:05.561 --> 14:08.262
Thought I might hit her up with
some veiled mutation questions.

14:08.264 --> 14:09.546
Good for you.

14:09.548 --> 14:11.715
Hey, just remember
to, uh, make sure

14:11.717 --> 14:13.883
I'm not turning into a
female clown fish, okay?

14:13.885 --> 14:16.886
(laughs) Or are you?
Funny.

14:16.888 --> 14:20.440
(phone vibrating, buzzing)

14:25.062 --> 14:26.330
HEATHER:
You should've seen Evan.

14:26.332 --> 14:27.564
He was, like,
ripping his clothes off,

14:27.566 --> 14:28.898
and I was all Meredith Grey,

14:28.900 --> 14:30.117
like, holding the
bloody compress for him.

14:30.119 --> 14:32.068
Thanks for all the details.
Yeah.

14:32.070 --> 14:34.237
Wait... (groans)
am I holding you up,

14:34.239 --> 14:36.673
or are you
holding me up?

14:36.675 --> 14:38.208
I am so sorry.

14:38.210 --> 14:39.743
Or hung over.

14:39.745 --> 14:42.379
Could-could I just run to
the pharmacy really quickly?

14:42.381 --> 14:44.214
A coffee plus aspirin and
I'm good to go, I promise.

14:44.216 --> 14:46.016
I'll be right back.
You go.

14:46.018 --> 14:48.268
I'll just be right here.
I'll be holding this wall up.

14:48.270 --> 14:50.604
Okay.
Okay.

14:50.606 --> 14:52.306
(groans)

15:01.149 --> 15:03.533
Did you get my message?

15:03.535 --> 15:05.435
I told you it isn't safe
to come back here.

15:05.437 --> 15:07.621
And I didn't want
Heather to overhear.

15:07.623 --> 15:09.706
Okay, so what's going on?

15:09.708 --> 15:12.826
Evan trying to hunt down
the vigilante again?

15:12.828 --> 15:15.212
More like my nurse.

15:15.214 --> 15:19.282
You might know her--
Alex Salter.

15:20.668 --> 15:23.086
Who is she?

15:23.088 --> 15:26.956
Uh... we were just friends.

15:26.958 --> 15:29.092
We grew up together.

15:29.094 --> 15:33.096
Her, me, JT, my brothers,
you know...

15:33.098 --> 15:37.868
and, uh, and later,
we-we were pretty close.

15:37.870 --> 15:41.488
Well, that explains it.

15:41.490 --> 15:43.106
Explains what?

15:43.108 --> 15:46.410
Why she was such a wreck.

15:46.412 --> 15:50.163
No... no, no,
no, no, no.

15:50.165 --> 15:51.615
You're just misreading her.

15:51.617 --> 15:54.451
It's been over ten years.

15:54.453 --> 15:55.752
She saw a ghost.

15:55.754 --> 15:58.655
No, Vincent,
I'm not misreading her.

16:00.508 --> 16:03.944
I should go; Heather's
going to be here any second.

16:19.510 --> 16:21.361
(car alarm chirps)

16:30.321 --> 16:32.723
It's me.

16:40.163 --> 16:42.781
Two soldiers came to
your mom's house.

16:42.783 --> 16:47.253
They said you were dead.

16:47.255 --> 16:49.667
Alex...

16:51.823 --> 16:56.409
I was... I was a part of
a Special Ops force.

16:56.411 --> 17:01.030
Okay, I... I had
seen too much, and...

17:01.032 --> 17:02.898
I knew too much.

17:02.900 --> 17:06.169
I threw dirt on
your casket, Vince.

17:06.171 --> 17:07.537
(crying)

17:07.539 --> 17:10.256
What could be so bad
that I had to do that?

17:10.258 --> 17:13.242
I know that this is going
to be hard to understand, okay?

17:13.243 --> 17:16.262
But you have to believe me.

17:16.263 --> 17:18.865
I promise the funeral was...

17:18.867 --> 17:21.550
it was to protect you
and everyone I cared about.

17:22.970 --> 17:27.772
Alex, my enemies, they were
out there; they were watching.

17:27.775 --> 17:31.093
I mean... they are
still out there.

17:31.095 --> 17:32.528
You could've come to me.

17:32.530 --> 17:35.114
No, no, it was
far too dangerous.

17:35.116 --> 17:36.932
You would've been
caught in the crossfire.

17:38.318 --> 17:40.536
These people,
they are dangerous,

17:40.538 --> 17:43.122
and they want me dead.

17:43.124 --> 17:47.493
This... whole secret life...

17:47.495 --> 17:48.995
what do you do?

17:48.997 --> 17:51.197
It's not much of a life.

17:51.199 --> 17:53.833
Who else knows?

17:58.088 --> 18:00.339
Fine.

18:00.341 --> 18:02.174
Wh-What about the detective?

18:02.176 --> 18:03.259
Who is she?

18:03.261 --> 18:07.146
And don't say no one.

18:07.148 --> 18:11.517
She's just, she's a cop
that they assigned me to.

18:11.519 --> 18:13.185
All right?
She looks out for me.

18:13.187 --> 18:15.238
She's like a, like a handler.

18:18.342 --> 18:21.444
You should've
just given up on me.

18:24.248 --> 18:27.199
I loved you.

18:27.201 --> 18:31.287
Alex, when I saw you
today in the hospital--

18:31.289 --> 18:33.172
You mean, when you ran away.

18:33.174 --> 18:38.461
I have... played this
moment over and over

18:38.463 --> 18:40.179
in my head for years.

18:40.181 --> 18:42.715
Okay?
I'm-I'm-I'm so sorry.

18:42.717 --> 18:44.684
I can't do this.

18:44.686 --> 18:47.386
Alex, I wanted to
contact you every day.

18:47.388 --> 18:49.188
Okay? Believe me.
Every day, but...

18:49.190 --> 18:54.060
it was easier to imagine that
you had some perfect husband,

18:54.062 --> 18:56.729
and three perfect
kids somewhere.

18:59.182 --> 19:02.485
I wanted that in
my life, once.

19:02.487 --> 19:06.656
We both did.

19:08.325 --> 19:11.210
But I just...

19:11.212 --> 19:15.298
Couldn't move on.

19:28.095 --> 19:30.179
Am I going to see you again?

19:37.821 --> 19:41.157
A stuffed bear?
How pathetic am I?

19:41.159 --> 19:42.391
No... you?

19:42.393 --> 19:44.243
Not even on
the Richter scale.

19:44.245 --> 19:47.913
Your loser partner,
closing in on a ten.

19:47.915 --> 19:49.665
Wait, no Red Vines?

19:49.667 --> 19:50.916
(sighs)

19:50.918 --> 19:53.703
Who knew 11 was even possible?

19:58.075 --> 19:59.875
I'm sorry.

19:59.877 --> 20:03.112
There is no way we could've
known what would happen to me.

20:03.114 --> 20:04.847
You have to let it go, okay?

20:04.849 --> 20:06.265
Okay.

20:06.267 --> 20:08.801
No, not okay.
Shoulders aren't lifting.

20:08.803 --> 20:11.771
What's up with you?

20:11.773 --> 20:16.225
You said you were staying
late to work on stuff.

20:16.227 --> 20:18.778
(sighs)

20:18.780 --> 20:22.148
Fine. Um, well, you know,
last night in the precinct,

20:22.150 --> 20:25.267
Joe and I had a
couple drinks, maybe more,

20:25.269 --> 20:28.120
and it got... weird.

20:28.122 --> 20:30.873
Weird, how?
Naked weird?

20:30.875 --> 20:32.941
No. But he's married.

20:32.943 --> 20:34.026
And even if they're
having problems,

20:34.028 --> 20:35.961
I don't want to
be sloppy seconds.

20:35.963 --> 20:37.713
You know, the other
woman thing sucks.

20:37.715 --> 20:38.998
Yeah, you never know
where you stand.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.299
Okay, if we
don't drop this,

20:40.301 --> 20:41.834
I'm going to break
out into a rash.

20:41.836 --> 20:43.586
What's on the laptop-- porn?
No...

20:44.254 --> 20:45.755
Uh! My turn to pry.

20:45.757 --> 20:48.791
(groans)

20:48.793 --> 20:51.293
Well, a little
Facebook stalking.

20:51.295 --> 20:52.795
Alex Salter.

20:52.797 --> 20:54.847
And he's...
A she, my nurse.

20:54.849 --> 20:56.599
I don't know,
a little detective thing.

20:56.601 --> 20:58.317
TESS: All right, well,
if you want to know

20:58.319 --> 21:00.903
who's changing your bed pan,
ditch the social media crap,

21:00.905 --> 21:02.471
and get on the NYPD database.

21:02.473 --> 21:04.973
That's a little bit deeper
than I wanted to dig.

21:06.493 --> 21:08.160
I got a hit.

21:08.162 --> 21:09.945
She doesn't have a record,

21:09.947 --> 21:12.181
but she filed six police
reports in three months.

21:12.183 --> 21:14.817
She complained of
someone following her,

21:14.819 --> 21:17.870
checking her e-mails,
wire tapping,

21:17.872 --> 21:19.505
and breaking and entering.

21:19.507 --> 21:21.540
But there's no signs
of forced entry.

21:21.542 --> 21:23.342
Are there any leads?

21:23.344 --> 21:24.960
Well, it's Precinct 86.

21:24.962 --> 21:27.713
Those stooges haven't even
looked into it yet.

21:27.715 --> 21:29.548
Only thing they did
was make notes.

21:29.550 --> 21:31.967
"Paranoid and delusional."

21:31.969 --> 21:33.853
That's pretty big words
for those guys.

21:33.855 --> 21:37.556
But, then again, your nurse
does sound a little 5150.

21:37.558 --> 21:39.775
(yawns)

21:42.028 --> 21:46.065
Okay, this is going about as
well as my love live, so...

21:46.067 --> 21:48.367
why don't I let you rest?

21:48.369 --> 21:49.952
Okay.

21:49.954 --> 21:51.153
Thanks, Tess.

21:51.155 --> 21:53.038
You got it.
See you tomorrow?

21:53.040 --> 21:54.523
Okay.

22:00.997 --> 22:02.131
(auto-dial beeping)

22:02.133 --> 22:03.215
(line ringing)

22:03.217 --> 22:04.967
What?

22:04.969 --> 22:06.669
CATHERINE: I think that
Alex is being watched.

22:06.671 --> 22:07.920
She says there's some

22:07.922 --> 22:09.672
faceless person following her.

22:09.674 --> 22:10.923
They tapped her phone,

22:10.925 --> 22:12.424
broke into her apartment.

22:12.426 --> 22:13.642
Well, it wasn't Vincent.

22:13.644 --> 22:14.877
He never went to see her,

22:14.879 --> 22:16.395
he always said it was
too painful.

22:16.397 --> 22:18.314
He cared about her too much.

22:18.316 --> 22:22.401
Well, does it sound like
someone else we know?

22:22.403 --> 22:24.603
Walks around without a face...

22:24.605 --> 22:27.323
taps into electronics
without being detected.

22:27.325 --> 22:29.558
JT, what if this is Muirfield?

22:31.194 --> 22:32.411
Oh, God.

22:32.413 --> 22:33.413
Put Vincent on the phone.

22:33.414 --> 22:34.396
I need to warn him.

22:34.398 --> 22:35.614
I can't.

22:35.616 --> 22:36.966
Why?

22:36.968 --> 22:39.869
I-I'm guessing he's with Alex.

22:39.871 --> 22:41.287
(sighs)

22:45.125 --> 22:47.510
(monitor alarm beeps)

22:54.351 --> 22:55.751
(car alarm chirps)

23:00.056 --> 23:01.390
(gasps)

23:01.392 --> 23:04.059
I saw you with your
little soldier boyfriend.

23:04.061 --> 23:06.612
That was him, right?

23:06.614 --> 23:08.280
I bet he's
gonna miss you.

23:08.282 --> 23:10.900
I've been thinking about
this for a long time.

23:10.902 --> 23:12.818
(gunshot)

23:15.739 --> 23:17.540
Stop! (groans)

23:20.911 --> 23:22.661
(gasping)

23:35.762 --> 23:37.897
I don't even know
how to thank you.

23:37.899 --> 23:39.098
(grunts)

23:39.100 --> 23:40.366
How did you know

23:40.368 --> 23:42.368
I'd be in trouble?

23:42.370 --> 23:43.953
I, uh... I didn't.

23:43.955 --> 23:46.489
I was just stopping by to say
thank you for the great

23:46.491 --> 23:48.157
health care.
Or maybe you started

23:48.159 --> 23:50.543
keeping tabs on me,
because of Vince?

23:52.112 --> 23:53.796
Of him coming to see me, I mean.

23:53.798 --> 23:55.665
It's okay.
It's okay.

23:55.667 --> 23:57.800
Vince told me everything.

23:57.802 --> 23:59.335
Obviously, that's...

23:59.337 --> 24:00.586
that's just what you do

24:00.588 --> 24:02.004
when you're somebody's handler.

24:04.391 --> 24:06.842
Alex, uh, who was that guy?

24:06.844 --> 24:09.011
Uh...

24:09.013 --> 24:11.230
I'd never
seen him before, but...

24:11.232 --> 24:13.015
he seemed to know me.

24:13.017 --> 24:14.567
He said he'd been thinking
about doing this for years.

24:14.569 --> 24:17.069
Detective Chandler,

24:17.071 --> 24:19.905
he might be the person
that's been watching me.

24:19.907 --> 24:21.607
I had a break-in
a few weeks ago.

24:21.609 --> 24:22.992
Oh, really?

24:22.994 --> 24:25.027
Did, uh,
they take anything?

24:25.029 --> 24:26.245
No.

24:26.247 --> 24:28.330
It was weird.

24:28.332 --> 24:31.467
I think whoever it was
just went through my closet.

Alex, it's Vince.
Open up.

26:03.743 --> 26:05.711
Uh, Catherine called
and left a message.

26:05.713 --> 26:06.912
What's going on?

26:06.914 --> 26:08.631
Oh, she's...
she's amazing.

26:08.633 --> 26:11.884
Your handler, she...
she saved my life.

26:11.886 --> 26:14.637
Right.

26:14.639 --> 26:18.107
ALEX: I, uh... wasn't sure
if I was gonna see you again.

26:18.109 --> 26:20.159
VINCENT:
Yeah, well, I'm-I'm here now.

26:20.161 --> 26:22.111
Is she
in there?

26:22.113 --> 26:25.030
ALEX: Oh, yes, sorry.
She's right in here.

26:25.949 --> 26:27.399
She's in the bedroom.

26:31.771 --> 26:33.489
"Handler"? Really?

26:33.491 --> 26:37.042
I didn't know
what else to say, I...

26:37.994 --> 26:41.630
Sorry, uh,
no trace of the perp.

26:41.632 --> 26:43.615
Well, they already
dusted for prints

26:43.617 --> 26:45.651
so I figured it was a long shot.
But he was in the apartment?

26:45.653 --> 26:47.386
Yeah, we think
a couple weeks ago,

26:47.388 --> 26:49.088
so any scent of him

26:49.090 --> 26:50.472
is probably
long gone.

26:50.474 --> 26:53.225
They find
any other evidence?

26:53.227 --> 26:55.627
A hair, some mud from shoes,

26:55.629 --> 26:56.812
but I never heard back.

26:56.814 --> 26:58.597
Probably booked it
into Property

26:58.599 --> 27:00.182
without analyzing it.

27:00.184 --> 27:03.068
Sometimes it's easier
to call someone crazy

27:03.070 --> 27:04.737
rather than
face the facts.

27:04.739 --> 27:06.188
You stay here with her.

27:06.190 --> 27:08.307
I'll be back.

27:13.613 --> 27:15.080
(wry laugh)

27:21.671 --> 27:23.422
Cat, what the hell
are you doing here?

27:23.424 --> 27:24.757
Following up on evidence.

27:24.759 --> 27:26.375
Yeah, of course, but
when you called it in,

27:26.377 --> 27:28.260
I thought you were
actually calling it in.

27:28.262 --> 27:30.012
Sit down.

27:30.014 --> 27:31.997
Okay.

27:31.999 --> 27:33.182
(groans)

27:33.184 --> 27:35.351
Your bandage is
bleeding through.

27:35.353 --> 27:37.052
Did your doctor release you?
Yeah.

27:37.054 --> 27:38.470
He said he was fine
with my recovery.

27:38.472 --> 27:40.890
Take down your jacket.

27:40.892 --> 27:42.691
Evan, you don't have to do this.

27:42.693 --> 27:44.526
Look, if he's not going to
look after you properly,

27:44.528 --> 27:46.345
I sure as hell am.

27:57.157 --> 27:58.791
(sighs)

27:58.793 --> 27:59.858
(groans quietly)

27:59.860 --> 28:01.076
By the way,

28:01.078 --> 28:02.962
my nurse said your work was

28:02.964 --> 28:04.413
"exquisite."

28:04.415 --> 28:06.799
She said that only
the best-trained surgeon

28:06.801 --> 28:08.000
could have pulled that off.

28:08.002 --> 28:10.753
Not a medical examiner
for NYPD.

28:10.755 --> 28:12.838
Another time, Cat.

28:14.891 --> 28:17.559
You, uh, get a match on that hair?
I did.

28:17.561 --> 28:19.595
But why are you digging around

28:19.597 --> 28:22.481
in an old case
from Precinct 86?

28:22.483 --> 28:24.266
Just a favor.

28:24.268 --> 28:26.902
And because it's
Precinct 86.

28:26.904 --> 28:28.103
Point taken.

28:29.739 --> 28:34.109
Yeah, I pulled
a name and a photo.

28:34.111 --> 28:35.361
He's an ex-con,

28:35.363 --> 28:36.695
released a couple of months ago.

28:36.697 --> 28:38.563
goes by the name of Connor...

28:38.565 --> 28:41.116
Connor Sorvino-- he was shot
twice in the takedown.

28:41.118 --> 28:42.418
He had three months in recovery,

28:42.420 --> 28:43.786
and the hospital
records I pulled,

28:43.788 --> 28:45.671
they showed you
as the attending.

28:45.673 --> 28:47.256
Oh, my God.

28:47.258 --> 28:49.541
We used to call him "Con Man."

28:49.543 --> 28:51.593
He-he thought he was
in love with me.

28:51.595 --> 28:52.928
He kept asking me

28:52.930 --> 28:55.297
to marry him,
but I said...

28:55.299 --> 28:56.748
What is it?

28:57.600 --> 28:59.802
Over-share, remember?

28:59.804 --> 29:03.472
I... said I was already in love.

29:05.258 --> 29:07.443
That my heart belonged
to someone else.

29:07.445 --> 29:11.447
Uh, okay, uh, Catherine, you got
to put a call out on that guy.

29:11.449 --> 29:13.782
He's dangerous.
It's not as easy as that.

29:13.784 --> 29:16.761
Forensics will sweep this
place and Alex's car.

29:16.786 --> 29:19.151
ALEX: Meaning they'll...
they'll find Vince's DNA?

29:19.490 --> 29:21.840
No, no. We can't have that.
VINCENT: I'm not

29:21.842 --> 29:24.356
having you walk around
like some kind of target.

29:24.456 --> 29:25.679
ALEX: Use me
as bait.

29:25.946 --> 29:27.655
I'll have you two
looking out for me.

29:27.680 --> 29:28.781
No.

29:28.782 --> 29:30.449
If we could draw him out.
That's not a good idea.

29:30.451 --> 29:32.084
Just listen.

29:32.086 --> 29:34.503
Connor's hacked
my e-mails, I know it.

29:34.505 --> 29:36.839
Sometimes he forgets to mark
the new ones "unread."

29:36.841 --> 29:38.223
If I write to a friend

29:38.225 --> 29:40.175
and say that I was
taking off after a shift

29:40.177 --> 29:42.144
to be with the guy I love.

29:42.146 --> 29:43.429
CATHERINE:
We don't know

29:43.431 --> 29:44.930
if he'll take that bait.

29:44.932 --> 29:46.965
Wait, are you saying
that this is a good call?

29:46.967 --> 29:48.684
It's not your call.

29:48.686 --> 29:50.736
It's mine.

30:02.115 --> 30:04.583

30:45.742 --> 30:48.577

people scream)

Come with me!

31:02.755 --> 31:04.288
Damn it!
What's wrong?

31:04.290 --> 31:07.007
She was just here!
She's still here.

31:07.009 --> 31:09.710
We'll find her.
(panting)

31:09.712 --> 31:11.378
Okay, come on.

31:14.015 --> 31:15.666
This place is
a damn echo chamber.

31:15.668 --> 31:17.301
I can hardly hear them.

31:17.303 --> 31:19.970
It's gonna be quicker
to find her if we split up.

31:19.972 --> 31:22.673
Or you find Connor first.
And then what?

31:22.675 --> 31:24.558
I don't think I can
cover up for you again.

31:24.560 --> 31:27.645
Alex's life is at stake.
Just be careful. (sighs)

You don't have to do...
Please! Please!

31:47.083 --> 31:48.082
ALEX: You don't have
to do this!

31:48.084 --> 31:49.700
I-I was good to you.

31:49.702 --> 31:51.251
I-I took care of you.

31:51.253 --> 31:52.753
That's why you would've been
the perfect wife.

31:52.755 --> 31:55.673
All you had to say was yes.
(gasps)

31:55.675 --> 31:57.424
When I saw you
with that Army grunt,

31:57.426 --> 31:59.927
I knew you'd never
love anyone else,

31:59.929 --> 32:02.329
that no one could take
the place of... (clicking in distance)

32:04.232 --> 32:05.683
...your first love.

32:05.685 --> 32:07.267
Please... let me go!

32:07.602 --> 32:08.602
Police!

32:13.942 --> 32:15.359

33:05.294 --> 33:06.660
come to rescue
your sweetheart.

33:06.662 --> 33:08.712
You willing to die for her?

33:09.297 --> 33:11.415
(gunfire)

33:11.417 --> 33:12.833
She's obviously
in love with you.

33:16.638 --> 33:18.121
(gunfire)

33:26.397 --> 33:29.183
Looks like you're still
in love with her.

34:06.771 --> 34:08.522
Great!
I can't see you.

34:08.524 --> 34:12.141
But if you don't come out...

34:12.143 --> 34:14.561
how will you ever
save her from me?

34:18.483 --> 34:20.150
No?

34:20.152 --> 34:22.069
Okay.

34:22.071 --> 34:24.420
But you just remember...

34:24.422 --> 34:28.158
this was your choice.

34:28.159 --> 34:32.529
(growling)

34:43.224 --> 34:45.708
How'd you do that?

(gasping, sobbing)

35:30.638 --> 35:32.806
I thought I'd lost you again.

35:32.808 --> 35:34.474
You okay?

35:34.476 --> 35:35.943
Yeah.
Okay.

That is so cool.

36:08.757 --> 36:10.841
And way better
than a sex change.

36:10.843 --> 36:13.427
Man, you'd be an ugly chick.

36:13.429 --> 36:15.929
Yeah, and sending you out to buy
bras would've been awkward.

36:15.931 --> 36:16.964
Well,

36:16.966 --> 36:18.331
if it makes you feel any better,

36:18.333 --> 36:19.433
I don't think gender
reassignment's

36:21.470 --> 36:23.020
Thanks.

36:23.022 --> 36:26.523
So, why is it
happening now, then?

36:26.525 --> 36:28.108
I think it's been
happening for a while,

36:28.110 --> 36:29.309
we just missed the symptoms.

36:29.311 --> 36:31.178
You, roaming around
on autopilot--

36:31.180 --> 36:34.865
there's a physical toll
to evolving so fast.

36:34.867 --> 36:36.650
So, what, they're basically
growing pains?

36:36.652 --> 36:37.801
Think about it:

36:37.803 --> 36:39.369
what you developed in a week,

36:39.371 --> 36:41.788
most species would take
a million years to pull off.

36:41.790 --> 36:42.990
Yeah, well, I'm just glad

36:42.992 --> 36:44.658
it happened when it did.

36:46.377 --> 36:50.097
Must have felt pretty good
to save Alex.

36:50.965 --> 36:53.500
Yeah. Yeah, it did.

36:56.838 --> 37:00.507
Anyway, aren't you late
for office hours?

37:11.069 --> 37:12.052
(knocking on door)

37:12.054 --> 37:13.103
EVAN:
Dr. Forbes.

37:13.105 --> 37:14.271
Evan Marks.

37:14.273 --> 37:15.606
NYPD, Medical Examiner's Office.

37:15.608 --> 37:17.024
Do you have a moment?

37:17.859 --> 37:19.526
Is there a problem?

37:19.528 --> 37:21.061
Uh... I got,

37:21.063 --> 37:22.395
like, 50 exams to grade.

37:22.397 --> 37:23.730
No, not at all.

37:23.732 --> 37:25.282
It's about something
that you wrote

37:25.284 --> 37:28.752
eight years ago,
on cross-species DNA.

37:28.754 --> 37:30.570
It's a strange subject.

37:30.572 --> 37:34.057
But I'm curious on the paper
that you published on it.

37:34.059 --> 37:36.593
Oh, yeah, the whole "Dolly
the Sheep" thing went down

37:36.595 --> 37:38.244
and I was trying
to ride that wave.

37:38.246 --> 37:39.796
But that was years ago.

37:39.798 --> 37:41.965
Well, you raised some
very valid questions back then,

37:41.967 --> 37:46.086
on how to splice species,
and how to reverse it.

37:46.088 --> 37:47.638
Well, it wasn't as breakthrough
as I thought.

37:47.640 --> 37:48.722
It was a dead end.

37:48.724 --> 37:50.474
See, I don't think it was.

37:50.476 --> 37:52.926
In fact, I'll go on further
and say that I have

37:52.928 --> 37:55.612
evidence that a cross-species
creature exists.

37:55.614 --> 37:57.614
All right, I'm on the edge

37:57.616 --> 37:59.449
of something groundbreaking.

37:59.451 --> 38:02.986
But this isn't exactly
my area of expertise.

38:02.988 --> 38:06.490
I could do with the help
of a biochemist...

38:06.492 --> 38:08.241
and I was hoping that it'd be

38:08.243 --> 38:09.159
the man who published
a paper on it.

38:09.161 --> 38:12.346
You really want
out of that morgue.

38:12.348 --> 38:15.415
I just don't want someone
that I care about

38:15.417 --> 38:16.883
to end up in it.

38:16.885 --> 38:20.420
You... think this thing's
a threat to her?

38:21.472 --> 38:23.690
Or... him?

38:23.692 --> 38:27.094
I would include you
in all aspects

38:27.096 --> 38:28.562
of the investigation.

38:28.564 --> 38:30.097
We'd share research,
information, everything.

38:30.099 --> 38:32.032
Even the spotlight.

38:32.034 --> 38:34.234
So, what do you say?

39:02.663 --> 39:05.048
I can help you with that.

39:05.050 --> 39:09.019
The, uh...
the dressing part.

39:09.021 --> 39:11.688
No, I got it.

39:11.690 --> 39:13.840
(clears throat softly)

39:13.842 --> 39:16.109
What do you got there?

39:17.979 --> 39:19.279
What? What is it?

39:19.281 --> 39:20.564
Show me.

39:22.150 --> 39:24.284
(sighs)

39:25.703 --> 39:27.904
You took this?

39:27.906 --> 39:30.323
I didn't mean to.

39:30.325 --> 39:31.575
It really...

39:31.577 --> 39:32.959
it was an accident.

39:32.961 --> 39:34.144
Um...

39:36.998 --> 39:39.699
I don't know.

39:39.701 --> 39:43.003
I guess I, uh...

39:43.005 --> 39:46.039
I wanted to know him.

39:46.041 --> 39:48.975
Hey, that guy isn't
completely gone, okay?

39:48.977 --> 39:51.511
Not when you're with her.

39:52.447 --> 39:54.314
You and I...

39:54.316 --> 39:57.601
we came together
out of some pretty dark places.

39:57.603 --> 40:01.154
It doesn't mean
that this isn't real.

40:01.156 --> 40:04.191
It doesn't mean that it's good.

40:07.328 --> 40:10.163
Is this your way
of dodging you and me?

40:10.165 --> 40:12.282
Think about it.

40:12.284 --> 40:15.585
You know, why are
we still stuck here?

40:15.587 --> 40:17.204
You know, why don't
you and me move forward?

40:17.206 --> 40:20.707
It... it's complicated.

40:20.709 --> 40:24.761
No, I think it's convenient
that it's complicated.

40:24.763 --> 40:28.381
Remember that
I've watched over you for years.

40:28.383 --> 40:31.802
I know your patterns,
and you like to pick

40:31.804 --> 40:33.553
bad boys.

40:33.555 --> 40:35.188
Yeah, so you don't
have to get serious.

40:35.190 --> 40:36.723
You can keep your distance.

40:36.725 --> 40:38.475
And I guess, in a way,

40:38.477 --> 40:41.311
I am the ultimate bad boy.

40:42.730 --> 40:46.933
Because I'm not really
an option for you, am I?

40:46.935 --> 40:49.736
You want me to believe
that your ex showing up

40:49.738 --> 40:52.155
doesn't change everything?

40:52.157 --> 40:56.543
It-it doesn't change us.

41:00.131 --> 41:03.416
Maybe you're right.

41:03.418 --> 41:05.836
Maybe I...

41:05.838 --> 41:11.675
don't remember how to be
close with somebody.

41:14.061 --> 41:16.179
But can you look me in the eye

41:16.181 --> 41:18.899
and tell me that you don't
still have feelings for...

41:18.901 --> 41:22.802
(both sigh)

41:26.357 --> 41:30.961
She still loves you, Vincent.

41:33.264 --> 41:37.150
Maybe you need to find out
if you still love her.
