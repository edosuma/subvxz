WEBVTT

00:07.000 --> 00:08.400
I don't know.

00:09.240 --> 00:10.435
Just come out.

00:15.800 --> 00:16.800
I prefer the last one.

00:16.920 --> 00:19.037
Me, too. It's a bit more subtle.
- Elegant, yeah.

00:19.160 --> 00:21.560
It's these bits, isn't it?
- Yep. Yeah. Last one, definitely.

00:21.680 --> 00:22.750
Yep. Great.

00:31.000 --> 00:32.439
I'm really pleased with that.
- Yeah.

00:32.479 --> 00:34.756
Once it's nipped in there.
- Oh, it'll perfect.

00:35.080 --> 00:36.080
His arms.

00:36.160 --> 00:37.674
Do you prefer weddings
or funerals?

00:37.760 --> 00:39.240
Weddings. His arms.

00:39.320 --> 00:41.136
I think there's something
humbling about funerals.

00:41.160 --> 00:43.834
Really?
- Yeah, it's good to dwell on the next life.

00:44.600 --> 00:46.273
You really think
there's a next life?

00:46.360 --> 00:48.272
What do you believe? Worm food?

00:48.840 --> 00:50.638
Mm.
- Why?

00:50.800 --> 00:52.154
Why what? His neck.

00:52.240 --> 00:54.311
Why would you believe
in something awful

00:54.560 --> 00:56.358
when you can believe
in something wonderful?

00:56.440 --> 00:57.760
Oh, don't make me an optimist.

00:57.840 --> 01:00.071
You will ruin my life.

01:00.960 --> 01:03.191
Have you been to many funerals?
- A couple.

01:03.800 --> 01:07.032
His neck.
- And you never felt them go somewhere?

01:07.160 --> 01:09.277
No, they were already gone.
His beautiful neck.

01:09.600 --> 01:10.670
What?

01:12.080 --> 01:14.037
What?
- You just said, "His beautiful neck."

01:15.200 --> 01:18.511
No, I, no, I-I said
th-that they were already gone.

01:19.560 --> 01:20.960
OK. Weird.

01:21.360 --> 01:22.874
Oh, right, so...

01:23.840 --> 01:26.560
This might be your idea of Hell

01:27.560 --> 01:30.598
but I think it's kind of special.

01:32.960 --> 01:34.314
His beautiful neck.

01:43.560 --> 01:44.680
Quaker meeting.

01:45.680 --> 01:46.830
You're not allowed to speak.

01:48.200 --> 01:49.480
If the Spirit moves you to speak

01:49.560 --> 01:51.631
you have to stand up
and share it with everyone.

01:53.280 --> 01:54.280
It's very intense.

01:55.280 --> 01:56.280
It's very quiet.

01:57.240 --> 01:59.550
It's very, very...

02:00.960 --> 02:01.996
erotic.

02:15.400 --> 02:16.400
Oh.

02:18.400 --> 02:19.400
I think...

02:20.920 --> 02:24.914
I'm going to go home
in November.

02:27.320 --> 02:28.320
I think.

02:43.760 --> 02:44.760
What's he thinking?

02:50.760 --> 02:51.796
What's he thinking?

03:01.280 --> 03:04.193
I don't really think it's...
I'm not really feeling... the...

03:04.480 --> 03:06.096
it's not anything
that's really affecting me...

03:06.120 --> 03:07.190
Oh, my...

03:08.480 --> 03:10.536
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God. What am I gonna say?

03:10.560 --> 03:12.320
What am I gonna say? What am I...

03:14.200 --> 03:15.395
I sometimes worry

03:16.840 --> 03:19.674
that I wouldn't be such
a feminist if I had bigger tits.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.480
Well, it's good you felt something.

03:38.520 --> 03:40.239
Is it?
- Something moved you.

03:40.320 --> 03:41.936
I'm not sure I needed to be moved

03:41.960 --> 03:43.160
to discover that about myself.

03:45.040 --> 03:46.040
What were you thinking?

03:46.041 --> 03:47.456
Well, I was thinking
about how peaceful I felt

03:47.480 --> 03:49.536
and then, for some reason,
I was thinking about your tits

03:49.560 --> 03:50.560
which kind of ruined it.

03:50.600 --> 03:52.881
Oh, my tits ruined your peace?
- Yeah, you could say that.

03:57.080 --> 03:58.040
I should probably...

03:58.041 --> 03:59.056
...open the café actually, um...
- I've got a confession actually

03:59.080 --> 04:00.456
actually in a little bit...
Oh, can I see it?

04:00.480 --> 04:01.480
Uh...

04:01.520 --> 04:03.910
Oh. Uh, yeah. It's a bit...

04:05.360 --> 04:06.360
What?

04:06.560 --> 04:08.631
It's a bit...
- What?

04:08.680 --> 04:10.034
The fuck?

04:10.160 --> 04:11.913
Wow.

04:12.400 --> 04:13.720
Hello.

04:14.160 --> 04:17.358
Oh, you gorgeous little thing.

04:18.920 --> 04:20.639
Can I ask, um...

04:21.279 --> 04:23.033
why so many guinea pigs?

04:23.600 --> 04:25.831
Oh, um, I just, um...

04:27.160 --> 04:29.436
This is an excellent one.

04:29.880 --> 04:31.616
I just thought it'd be
a unique selling point.

04:31.640 --> 04:32.640
Yeah.

04:33.040 --> 04:35.555
Which came first, the guinea pig
or the guinea pig café?

04:35.640 --> 04:38.314
That is a big old question.

04:38.720 --> 04:39.720
Fair enough.

04:41.400 --> 04:43.960
What do guinea pigs do?
- Um, they are born

04:44.040 --> 04:45.736
they shit themselves with fear,
and then they die.

04:47.920 --> 04:49.513
Can I use that at the wedding?

04:50.320 --> 04:51.549
Seriously, I need material.

04:51.640 --> 04:54.109
Tell me about your stepmother-to-be.

04:54.200 --> 04:55.919
Any, uh... what's she like?

04:56.560 --> 04:58.040
Oh, she's, um...

04:59.560 --> 05:00.560
she's from Exeter.

05:01.120 --> 05:02.156
Mm-hmm.

05:02.520 --> 05:03.920
OK, thank you.
That's very helpful.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.070
How did she meet your dad?

05:06.360 --> 05:08.352
Through my mother.
- Right.

05:08.440 --> 05:09.816
She was my mother's student
at one point.

05:09.840 --> 05:11.376
Do your parents get on?

05:11.400 --> 05:13.437
No. Were you close to your mum?

05:13.760 --> 05:15.114
Yeah. You?

05:16.520 --> 05:17.520
Not really.

05:18.280 --> 05:19.976
How come?
- So that must've been a bit weird.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.440
Well, I don't really think about it.

05:26.960 --> 05:29.040
So you run... no, no.
- So do you go back a lot to...

05:29.080 --> 05:31.231
Do you run this place
on your own?

05:32.200 --> 05:33.680
No, I opened it with a friend.

05:33.760 --> 05:35.320
Oh, cool, right.
So you run it together?

05:35.400 --> 05:36.470
No, she's...

05:37.400 --> 05:38.516
She, uh...

05:39.040 --> 05:40.040
She what?

05:43.800 --> 05:45.996
What?
- What?

05:46.440 --> 05:47.760
She, she what?

05:49.120 --> 05:50.120
She...

05:52.440 --> 05:54.240
He's a bit annoying, actually.
- What is that?

05:55.520 --> 05:56.520
What?

05:56.720 --> 05:58.154
That thing that you're doing.

05:58.240 --> 05:59.959
It's like you disappear.
- What?

06:00.040 --> 06:01.713
What are you not telling me?
- Nothing.

06:01.800 --> 06:03.496
Tell me what's going on underneath there.
- Nothing.

06:03.520 --> 06:05.080
Tell me, come on. You can tell me.
- No.

06:05.120 --> 06:06.800
Nothing. Nothing!
- Ah! What are you doing?

06:06.840 --> 06:08.559
No, stop being so churchy.

06:08.640 --> 06:10.376
I'm not being churchy,
I'm just trying to get to know you.

06:10.400 --> 06:11.400
Well, I don't want that.

06:21.560 --> 06:23.760
Listen, I'm just, I'm just,
I'm just trying to help you.

06:24.560 --> 06:25.560
What?

06:27.680 --> 06:29.319
No. No, I didn't mean...

06:29.400 --> 06:30.536
Oh, I know what you mean, Father.

06:30.560 --> 06:31.816
Thank you so much
for your guidance.

06:31.840 --> 06:33.016
Come on, I didn't, I didn't mean...

06:33.040 --> 06:34.136
Oh, look, I really should
get back to work.

06:34.160 --> 06:35.760
A customer's bound
to turn up any minute.

06:35.960 --> 06:37.216
And you should probably
be getting back to God

06:37.240 --> 06:38.240
don't you think?

06:41.080 --> 06:43.197
I think you've played
with my guinea pig long enough.

06:52.640 --> 06:53.640
OK.

07:02.160 --> 07:03.310
Alright, bye.

07:20.120 --> 07:22.280
Sorry, girls,
people are starting to arrive.

07:27.960 --> 07:29.917
She was a spectacular woman.

07:41.960 --> 07:42.960
<i>Don't worry.</i>

07:43.040 --> 07:44.110
We can sort this out.

07:57.120 --> 07:58.679
Stop doing that to your face.

07:58.760 --> 07:59.760
No, I have to.

07:59.840 --> 08:02.036
I don't know what's wrong.
I just...

08:02.560 --> 08:04.472
I look so good.

08:04.760 --> 08:06.399
It's OK.
We can sort it out.

08:06.480 --> 08:08.597
Just take
some of your makeup off.

08:08.680 --> 08:09.760
I'm not wearing any makeup.

08:10.080 --> 08:11.080
What?

08:11.200 --> 08:12.200
What has happened?

08:12.201 --> 08:13.536
I have never seen you...
- No, I don't know.

08:13.560 --> 08:14.776
...look so good.
- I just woke up looking amazing

08:14.800 --> 08:16.216
and then everyone's gonna think
I got a fucking facial

08:16.240 --> 08:17.390
for my mother's funeral.

08:17.520 --> 08:18.556
Oh, what the hell?

08:18.680 --> 08:20.831
You look incredible.
- We're trying to mess her up.

08:21.280 --> 08:22.496
Just no matter what I do
with my hair

08:22.520 --> 08:25.115
it just keeps falling
in this really chic way.

08:25.920 --> 08:27.195
Oh, God.

08:27.440 --> 08:28.440
You look perfect.

08:29.040 --> 08:30.040
Thank you.

08:30.120 --> 08:32.191
Sorry, girls,
people are starting to arrive.

08:32.799 --> 08:34.856
Thank you.
- You don't have to greet them if it's too...

08:34.880 --> 08:36.438
Gosh, you look gorgeous.

08:37.360 --> 08:38.360
Thank you.

08:40.440 --> 08:41.919
I'm so sorry.
- Thank you.

08:42.480 --> 08:44.073
You look glorious.
- Thank you.

08:45.120 --> 08:47.112
Have you spoken to Dad?
- No, not yet.

08:47.320 --> 08:48.320
He's avoiding me.

08:48.800 --> 08:50.951
My deepest condolences, girls.

08:51.240 --> 08:52.640
She was magnificent.

08:52.720 --> 08:53.736
Thanks so much.
- Thank you so much.

08:53.760 --> 08:55.035
My God, you look well.

08:55.360 --> 08:56.396
Thank you. Have you?

08:57.040 --> 08:58.474
No, he's not really engaging.

08:58.560 --> 09:00.836
She was a spectacular woman.

09:00.920 --> 09:01.920
Thanks.

09:01.921 --> 09:03.070
Darling, you look wonderful.

09:03.120 --> 09:04.600
Oh, my God.

09:04.760 --> 09:05.920
- Hi, Claire.
- Hi.

09:06.240 --> 09:08.960
Gosh, grief clearly agrees with you.

09:09.160 --> 09:10.276
Thank you, Jeremy.

09:12.600 --> 09:13.920
Oh, incoming.

09:14.720 --> 09:15.836
How are you doing?

09:15.920 --> 09:17.479
My God, she's shameless.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.957
Can you not think
the fucking worst of someone

09:20.040 --> 09:21.918
for just a split fucking second?

09:22.200 --> 09:23.759
Not everyone is after cock.

09:35.280 --> 09:36.919
She's definitely trying
to fuck my dad.

09:37.280 --> 09:38.440
Well, she ain't made of wood.

09:40.560 --> 09:41.630
Do you want a ciggy?

09:45.360 --> 09:46.430
Oh, incoming.

09:46.760 --> 09:49.275
- Hi, Harry.
- Hi, hi.

09:49.880 --> 09:50.950
You OK?
- Mm-hmm.

09:52.200 --> 09:54.351
You? Do you need anything?

09:54.600 --> 09:57.115
Uh, no, I'm good, thanks.
I've just had a large glass of water.

09:58.560 --> 09:59.560
Are your trousers OK?

10:00.080 --> 10:02.549
I... sorry,
I-I left them in the dryer.

10:02.680 --> 10:03.716
Oh, mate.

10:04.280 --> 10:06.112
Oh, sh-shit. Sorry.

10:06.680 --> 10:08.990
It's OK.

10:09.320 --> 10:12.518
Funerals, when you actually knew
the person, they're so...

10:12.920 --> 10:13.920
Oh.

10:20.400 --> 10:22.073
It just doesn't feel real. I...

10:24.480 --> 10:26.437
I'm just gonna miss her so much.

10:27.600 --> 10:28.875
Have you, have you cried yet?

10:29.560 --> 10:30.560
Yes.

10:30.840 --> 10:32.035
Well, I didn't see you cr...

10:33.320 --> 10:34.470
Wow, you look...

10:35.200 --> 10:36.793
Have... have you had
your eyebrows done?

10:38.080 --> 10:39.640
Hi, girls. How are you doing?

10:40.480 --> 10:41.630
Alright.
- I'm good, thanks.

10:41.840 --> 10:43.200
You know,
the hard bit's gonna come

10:43.280 --> 10:45.158
in a few weeks,
when it all calms down.

10:45.800 --> 10:47.951
Yeah, I have heard.
- They do say that, yeah, yeah.

10:48.040 --> 10:49.360
When people start to forget

10:49.960 --> 10:51.760
and the cards and the flowers
stop turning up.

10:52.360 --> 10:53.279
Yeah.
- Uh-huh, yeah.

10:53.280 --> 10:54.280
And people just disappear

10:54.320 --> 10:56.000
because it spooks them
to be around someone

10:56.080 --> 10:57.080
perpetually in pain.

10:57.160 --> 10:58.196
OK.
- Right.

10:58.280 --> 11:00.176
And your lovely boyfriends
might not be able to cope.

11:00.200 --> 11:02.016
Oh, well, he's my husband, so...
- I'm sure they'll push through.

11:02.040 --> 11:03.896
But I just want you to know
that I will always be there for you

11:03.920 --> 11:04.920
always.

11:05.560 --> 11:07.119
Always.
- Thank you.

11:08.360 --> 11:09.430
Always.

11:11.480 --> 11:12.630
Always.

11:14.120 --> 11:15.634
I'm gonna check
on the sausage rolls.

11:16.040 --> 11:18.635
OK.

11:23.320 --> 11:24.390
See?

11:25.240 --> 11:26.799
- OK.
- Yeah.

11:32.400 --> 11:34.471
Hey.
- I don't know how you're eating.

11:35.520 --> 11:36.749
Do something.

11:52.760 --> 11:53.760
Hi.

11:53.880 --> 11:55.712
Oh. Hello, darling.

11:57.760 --> 11:59.319
- Bit tight.
- Oh, yeah.

11:59.440 --> 12:02.194
Tell me about it.

12:09.480 --> 12:11.392
I found her very difficult,
you know?

12:13.040 --> 12:14.040
I know.

12:14.800 --> 12:17.918
I... I loved her, but, um...

12:18.480 --> 12:20.790
That's all that really matters.
- No, I don't think it is.

12:22.800 --> 12:24.120
Her instincts were, you know

12:24.360 --> 12:28.354
she... she just knew how to be fun.

12:29.320 --> 12:30.356
How to be kind.

12:30.920 --> 12:32.036
She just knew.

12:34.040 --> 12:35.360
I'm just guessing.

12:37.960 --> 12:39.280
You're fun, Dad.

12:39.360 --> 12:41.670
No, I didn't like that about her, you see.

12:42.560 --> 12:45.394
I loved her, but I didn't like
that she was...

12:48.800 --> 12:50.473
For a long time, I...

12:53.160 --> 12:54.160
And today...

12:57.040 --> 12:58.554
I was jealous of her.

12:58.960 --> 12:59.996
Uh-huh.

13:01.600 --> 13:03.193
That is a lovely thing to say, really.

13:04.920 --> 13:06.036
Oh, sorry.

13:09.640 --> 13:11.074
I'll leave you two.

13:18.400 --> 13:19.880
She's a bit annoying, isn't she?

13:19.920 --> 13:21.115
Mm.
- Hmm.

13:22.760 --> 13:24.399
Look, let's go and find your sister.

13:24.480 --> 13:27.791
No, I don't think she wants to see me.
- Yeah, she loves you.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.356
She just didn't get the fun gene.

13:31.520 --> 13:33.876
Yeah.

13:39.720 --> 13:40.915
I just...

13:43.360 --> 13:44.874
I don't know what to do.
- I know.

13:45.880 --> 13:46.916
I know.

13:48.520 --> 13:49.520
Buck up.

13:50.280 --> 13:52.397
Smile. Charm.

13:53.960 --> 13:54.996
Off we go.

13:57.200 --> 13:58.350
We'll be OK.

14:02.640 --> 14:03.756
I'll follow you.

14:07.960 --> 14:09.474
You look lovely, by the way.

14:10.280 --> 14:11.280
Thank you.

14:27.320 --> 14:29.120
<i>I don't know what to do with it.</i>

14:29.520 --> 14:30.520
<i>With what?</i>

14:31.160 --> 14:32.640
With all the love I have for her.

14:35.640 --> 14:36.640
I don't know where to...

14:37.960 --> 14:39.189
put it now.

14:40.200 --> 14:41.200
I'll take it.

14:43.360 --> 14:45.795
No, I'm serious. It sounds lovely.

14:47.920 --> 14:49.036
I'll have it.

14:49.720 --> 14:50.995
You have to give it to me.

14:51.040 --> 14:52.394
OK.

14:54.120 --> 14:55.440
It's got to go somewhere.

Whoa, why are you awake?

15:48.480 --> 15:50.199
It's 9:45.
- Oh, my God.

15:50.320 --> 15:51.856
I thought you were just
in my head then.

15:51.880 --> 15:53.792
But, I mean,
you were in my head then.

15:54.200 --> 15:56.192
But now you're there.

15:56.880 --> 15:59.236
Are you OK, Father?

15:59.520 --> 16:01.000
Oh, fuck you calling me Father

16:01.120 --> 16:03.157
like it doesn't turn you on
just to say it.

16:07.640 --> 16:08.640
Do you want a drink?

16:09.520 --> 16:10.520
OK.

16:11.040 --> 16:12.040
Don't move.

16:17.840 --> 16:19.280
Are you a nostalgic person?

16:21.200 --> 16:22.200
Yeah.

16:22.240 --> 16:23.390
Do you like Winnie the Pooh?

16:23.600 --> 16:24.519
Yeah.

16:24.520 --> 16:25.874
I-I fucking love Winnie the Pooh.

16:26.640 --> 16:28.871
I can't read a Winnie the Pooh quote
without crying.

16:29.840 --> 16:30.840
Fuck.

16:32.240 --> 16:33.240
Piglet.

16:35.400 --> 16:36.400
Piglet.

16:38.160 --> 16:39.160
Why are you here?

16:39.240 --> 16:41.436
Sorry, but, I mean,
why-why are you...

16:42.280 --> 16:43.714
Were you looking for me?

16:46.640 --> 16:48.760
I was on the verge
of having a little prayer actually.

16:49.080 --> 16:50.639
No.

16:50.840 --> 16:53.116
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, don't...

16:53.480 --> 16:55.233
Don't you dare. That's my thing.

16:55.600 --> 16:56.720
What were you praying about?

16:57.000 --> 16:58.256
Please say you were praying for me.

16:58.280 --> 16:59.776
I could do with the extra pair of hands.

16:59.800 --> 17:03.714
Mine don't seem to have
the fucking reach anymore.

17:06.760 --> 17:07.760
God help me.

17:08.760 --> 17:09.876
Whoa!

17:10.480 --> 17:11.480
Thank you.

17:14.440 --> 17:16.656
Do you know there was a man
who wanted to be a saint so badly

17:16.680 --> 17:18.830
he castrated himself
just to stop himself...

17:20.480 --> 17:22.517
you know... whack!

17:24.440 --> 17:25.440
Wow.

17:32.480 --> 17:33.630
Here's to peace.

17:36.600 --> 17:38.193
And those who get
in the way of it.

17:53.240 --> 17:54.469
I'm sorry about today.

17:56.560 --> 17:57.560
Forget it.

17:58.280 --> 17:59.280
Look at this.

18:05.600 --> 18:06.600
Look at it.

18:07.360 --> 18:08.919
That's the first one I ever got.

18:10.440 --> 18:12.079
Went all the way to Rome for that.

18:12.680 --> 18:15.673
Such a nerd.

18:15.840 --> 18:18.230
Two years before I was even
allowed to wear it

18:18.320 --> 18:20.516
but I just... I couldn't wait.

18:20.760 --> 18:21.989
I couldn't wait.

18:22.320 --> 18:26.280
I knew I wanted a bold,
you know, this colour

18:26.680 --> 18:28.160
but proper plum.

18:28.240 --> 18:30.118
You can only get proper plum in Italy.

18:31.400 --> 18:33.676
Sometimes I worry
I'm only in it for the outfits.

18:36.920 --> 18:38.195
So beautiful, isn't it?

18:42.200 --> 18:43.680
I mean, your stuff is lovely, too.

18:43.920 --> 18:45.149
Hmm.

18:45.920 --> 18:47.149
What were you praying about?

18:52.920 --> 18:55.116
You don't like
answering questions, do you?

19:01.600 --> 19:02.600
OK.

19:08.720 --> 19:09.720
Come with me.

19:12.960 --> 19:14.189
I know what to do with you.

19:15.880 --> 19:18.315
You go in there, I go in there.

19:19.320 --> 19:21.039
And you make me tell you
all my secrets

19:21.120 --> 19:22.873
so you can ultimately trap
and control me?

19:23.040 --> 19:24.040
Yeah.

19:24.440 --> 19:26.591
No. You tell me
what's weighing on your heart

19:26.680 --> 19:29.070
and I listen without judgment
and in complete confidence.

19:29.160 --> 19:31.231
- Sounds dodgy.
- I just listen.

19:31.320 --> 19:33.240
At the very least,
it'll shut me up for a minute.

19:33.480 --> 19:35.597
I'm not Catholic.
- Tonight, that doesn't matter.

19:35.840 --> 19:37.120
Won't I catch fire or something?

19:37.280 --> 19:39.440
If you did, it would confirm
my faith, so let's try it.

19:39.480 --> 19:40.516
Go on.

19:45.440 --> 19:46.440
Go on.

19:50.720 --> 19:51.720
Alright.

20:04.640 --> 20:05.710
OK, now you say

20:05.880 --> 20:07.096
"Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned..."

20:07.120 --> 20:09.096
- I'm not gonna say that.
- What? Very good.

20:09.120 --> 20:11.760
"It's been..."
uh, enter days, years, months

20:11.840 --> 20:13.360
"...since my last confession."
- Mm-mm.

20:13.480 --> 20:15.711
Then I say, "That's OK,"
blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah

20:15.960 --> 20:17.256
till you tell me what's on your mind.

20:17.280 --> 20:19.112
Tell me your s...

20:19.360 --> 20:20.430
Sins.

20:20.560 --> 20:21.835
Sins. If you want.

20:22.200 --> 20:25.079
Why would I tell you my sins?
- Because it will make you feel better.

20:25.280 --> 20:26.509
And because...

20:26.800 --> 20:27.995
I want to know!

20:30.960 --> 20:31.960
OK.

20:38.920 --> 20:39.990
I lied.

20:40.680 --> 20:41.716
OK.

20:42.520 --> 20:43.520
To you.

20:44.760 --> 20:45.796
About?

20:46.000 --> 20:47.957
About the miscarriage.

20:55.640 --> 20:58.216
I was just covering for my sister,
who actually had the miscarriage

20:58.240 --> 21:00.760
because her husband didn't know
she was pregnant, and it just...

21:01.840 --> 21:02.876
OK.

21:06.840 --> 21:07.910
Keep going.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.434
Well, I've stolen things.

21:12.840 --> 21:16.516
I've had a lot of sex
outside of marriage.

21:18.320 --> 21:20.755
And once or twice
inside someone else's.

21:21.920 --> 21:23.877
Uh, there's been a spot of sodomy.

21:24.920 --> 21:27.719
Then, much masturbation

21:27.920 --> 21:30.435
a bit of violence, and of course
the endless fucking blasphemy.

21:32.800 --> 21:33.916
And?

21:35.480 --> 21:36.480
And...

21:39.280 --> 21:40.280
Go on.

21:40.760 --> 21:41.796
And...

21:45.280 --> 21:46.316
I...

21:49.920 --> 21:50.920
I can't.

21:52.880 --> 21:54.030
It's OK. Go on.

21:55.920 --> 21:56.956
Frightened.

21:57.640 --> 21:58.710
Of what?

21:59.960 --> 22:01.155
Forgetting things.

22:02.880 --> 22:03.950
People.

22:05.040 --> 22:06.156
Forgetting people.

22:10.640 --> 22:14.395
And I'm ashamed of not knowing

22:14.480 --> 22:16.199
what I...
- What you want?

22:16.280 --> 22:17.456
It's OK not to know what you want.

22:17.480 --> 22:18.480
No, I know what I want.

22:18.520 --> 22:20.796
I know exactly what I want, right now.

22:21.600 --> 22:22.600
What's that?

22:25.760 --> 22:26.796
It's bad.

22:28.040 --> 22:29.076
It's OK.

22:31.440 --> 22:33.560
I want someone to tell me
what to wear in the morning.

22:35.920 --> 22:37.576
OK, well, I think
there are people who can...

22:37.600 --> 22:40.160
No, I want someone to tell me
what to wear every morning.

22:42.240 --> 22:44.038
I want someone to tell me
what to eat.

22:45.280 --> 22:48.114
What to like, what to hate,
what to rage about.

22:48.760 --> 22:50.752
What to listen to, what band to like.

22:51.120 --> 22:52.759
What to buy tickets for.

22:52.920 --> 22:54.832
What to joke about,
what not to joke about.

22:54.920 --> 22:56.877
I want someone to tell me
what to believe in.

22:58.560 --> 23:00.995
Who to vote for and who to love
and how to...

23:02.120 --> 23:03.120
tell them.

23:07.960 --> 23:09.560
I just think I want someone
to tell me...

23:12.000 --> 23:14.176
how to live my life, Father, because so far

23:14.200 --> 23:15.600
I think I've been getting it wrong.

23:17.440 --> 23:20.080
But I know that's why people
want people like you in their lives

23:20.600 --> 23:22.432
because you just tell them how to do it.

23:22.880 --> 23:25.031
You just tell them what to do

23:25.600 --> 23:27.056
and what they'll get out of the end of it

23:27.080 --> 23:28.799
even though I don't believe
your bullshit.

23:28.880 --> 23:31.076
And I know that scientifically
nothing that I do

23:31.160 --> 23:32.576
makes any difference in the end anyway.

23:32.600 --> 23:33.954
I'm still scared.

23:34.080 --> 23:35.753
Why am I still scared?

23:46.200 --> 23:47.634
So just tell me what to do.

23:52.400 --> 23:54.835
Just fucking tell me what to do, Father.

24:04.200 --> 24:05.200
Kneel.

24:07.680 --> 24:08.680
What?

24:11.600 --> 24:12.670
Kneel.

24:19.280 --> 24:20.316
