Those pancakes smell great.</i>

00:04.594 --> 00:06.095
What are you doing with those?

00:06.179 --> 00:07.699
Luke and I are doing
a recycling drive.

00:07.763 --> 00:09.867
If we collect enough bottles,
they build a school in Africa.

00:09.891 --> 00:13.477
<i>Wouldn't that be so cool to go
to a school made out of bottles?</i>

00:13.561 --> 00:16.647
<i>That would certainly be
a special school.</i>

00:16.731 --> 00:19.734
Did you hear what I said, parents?
“Special school”?

00:19.817 --> 00:22.945
Okay, nobody make a big deal
about it, but I just broke up with Dylan.

00:23.070 --> 00:25.656
<i>No! Oh, my gosh.
Are you okay, honey?</i>

00:25.740 --> 00:27.658
Yeah, I'm fine. I just...

00:27.742 --> 00:29.702
I need to date someone
who has a clue,

00:29.785 --> 00:31.704
instead of an idiot
who bangs his head...

00:31.787 --> 00:34.874
every time he rides his bike out
of his garage— every time!

00:34.957 --> 00:37.585
I'm sorry, honey.

00:37.668 --> 00:41.380
I'm sorry for both of you.
I'll have to text him later.

00:41.464 --> 00:43.466
<i>Mmm. I gotta jump in the
shower. I'm gonna be late.</i>

00:43.549 --> 00:45.736
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to meet
my friend Valerie.

00:45.760 --> 00:48.054
I haven't seen her in 15 years.
We used to work together.

00:48.137 --> 00:50.097
- You worked?
- Mm-hmm.

00:50.223 --> 00:52.242
Can't imagine you working.
Luke, let me tell you something.

00:52.266 --> 00:54.185
That is very offensive to women.

00:54.268 --> 00:57.980
Your mom works very hard.
It's just now she works for us.

00:59.398 --> 01:01.943
I will have you know that I had
quite the little career going.

01:02.026 --> 01:04.487
I was an account manager
at Starcrest Hotels.

01:04.570 --> 01:07.740
I had a little cubicle, and-and
I wore my tennis shoes to work...

01:07.823 --> 01:09.242
and changed into my work pumps.

01:09.325 --> 01:10.785
<i>It was</i> very <i>Working Girl.</i>

01:10.910 --> 01:12.828
That movie's so clutch.
Mm-hmm.

01:12.912 --> 01:15.331
I don't mind saying
I was making quite a splash.

01:15.414 --> 01:18.459
- Well, then, Why'd you quit?
- Well, Haley, call me old-fashioned,

01:18.542 --> 01:20.419
but I wanted to focus
on raising a family.

01:20.503 --> 01:22.546
So I married your dad.

01:22.630 --> 01:25.132
Five months later,
we... were...

01:25.216 --> 01:28.511
four months away from having
this little bundle of joy.

01:28.594 --> 01:30.888
Mm-hmm.

01:32.515 --> 01:34.642
There's my lawyer.

01:34.725 --> 01:36.644
Gloria got into
a little car accident,

01:36.727 --> 01:38.646
so my dad asked me
to help her out.

01:38.729 --> 01:42.441
And, uh, this is the first time that
my dad's asked me for legal advice,

01:42.525 --> 01:44.443
and it's— it's nice.

01:44.527 --> 01:46.696
It's nice to know
that he respects me in that way.

01:46.821 --> 01:49.031
Well, Mitchell is an
amazing lawyer. Oh.

01:49.115 --> 01:51.993
My dream for him is that one
day he'll be on the Supreme Court.

01:52.076 --> 01:54.287
Why, Cam?

01:54.370 --> 01:58.040
So at parties I can tell everyone
my partner is one of the Supremes.

01:59.709 --> 02:02.837
There he is— the steely,
grizzled veteran...

02:02.920 --> 02:05.006
ready to do battle
with the plucky upstart.

02:05.089 --> 02:07.508
Speed versus grace.
Brute force versus...

02:07.591 --> 02:10.344
- Let's just <i>do</i> this.
<i>- [Cameron] Jay and / are both gym rat's.</i>

02:10.428 --> 02:12.346
I love the sauna.
That's the dry heat.

02:12.430 --> 02:13.973
And the steam, wet.

02:14.056 --> 02:16.892
And, of course, I am
just a kook for racquetball.

02:16.976 --> 02:21.147
Club champ two years in a row,
Tonganoxie, Missouri Rec Center.

02:21.230 --> 02:24.984
So, naturally, Jay and I
have been trying for months...

02:25.067 --> 02:28.321
to get together to bang the
old hollow rubber ball around.

02:30.031 --> 02:32.366
I have been avoiding this day
like the plague.

02:32.450 --> 02:35.828
I mean, part of going to the gym
is the locker-room atmosphere.

02:35.911 --> 02:38.914
And if I'm there with a gay guy,
it's-it's just not gonna be the same.

02:38.998 --> 02:41.042
I mean, for me,
it's a locker room.

02:41.125 --> 02:43.127
For him, it's a showroom.

02:44.211 --> 02:46.339
She doesn't get it.

Okay, fine.

Very liberal with the towels.
I love that.

03:49.777 --> 03:51.862
Showers are private,
in case you wondered.

03:51.946 --> 03:54.657
I wasn't, but
thanks for the heads-up.

03:54.782 --> 03:58.119
Now, that's a surprise.
Boxers. Is that necessary?

03:58.202 --> 04:00.913
Well, I just always pictured you
as a tighty-whitey guy.

Well, do me a favor. The next time you
picture me, leave the underwear out of it.

Well, don't you worry.

And just then, it hit me.
She was jealous of me.

06:32.648 --> 06:35.248
Yes, there'd always been a little bit
of a competition between us.

06:35.317 --> 06:37.695
This was more serious.

06:37.778 --> 06:40.406
She was looking at my life
as something...

06:40.489 --> 06:43.576
that she'd always wanted,
but never had.

06:43.659 --> 06:45.077
So how's life in the trenches?

Wow. That's insane.

Were there any witnesses?

07:34.793 --> 07:36.920
No, just Manny.
He was in the back seat.

07:37.046 --> 07:39.798
Okay. It all happened

- I'm sorry. What?
- Don't look at me. Do something. Take pictures.

07:59.985 --> 08:02.655
Manny! What kind
of cupcake do you want?

08:02.738 --> 08:05.532
<i>Um, that's okay.
I'm not hungry.</i>

08:05.616 --> 08:08.410

<i>- Are you okay?</i>
- <i>I'm</i> fine.

08:11.622 --> 08:13.791

She's a danger <i>to us</i> all.
<i>Okay, waif. Now slop.</i>

08:16.794 --> 08:19.546
I thought she said he was parked
and then he cut her off.

Everybody looks parked when
you're going a hundred miles an hour.

08:22.049 --> 08:24.385
Manny, why didn't you speak up?

08:24.468 --> 08:26.845
She can't take criticism
about her driving.

08:26.929 --> 08:28.931
Once an old lady yelled
at her at a crosswalk.

08:29.014 --> 08:30.933

the horn ran out.

That is game and,
I believe, match.

08:55.249 --> 08:58.419
<i>Yeah, fine, you won.
But, you know, what do you expect?</i>

08:58.502 --> 09:01.815
For the first half of the game, I was
distracted by what happened in the locker room.

09:01.839 --> 09:04.758
And you're sure it's not because
I'm a fabulous racquetball player?

09:04.842 --> 09:07.428
You're average. But I was a
little thrown by you touching me.

09:07.511 --> 09:09.722
Which is unnatural—
Not to you, of course.

09:09.805 --> 09:11.890
- No, to you it's like rocket fuel.
- Oh, sure.

09:11.974 --> 09:14.852
When you're gay you just walk
around giving butt bumps to everybody.

09:14.935 --> 09:16.854
It's like a high five.
It's a low two.

09:16.937 --> 09:20.232
You know what? I'm gonna prove that
you won only because I was distracted.

09:20.315 --> 09:22.609
We're gonna have a rematch
right here, right now.

09:22.735 --> 09:24.653
So you want to go up
against me again? Yes.

09:24.737 --> 09:26.488
No! Damn it.

09:31.493 --> 09:34.079
Yes. I mean, I wasn't there,
but she's a horrible driver.

09:34.163 --> 09:35.849
If she hit 10 cars,

19:39.726 --> 19:41.644
I'm scared.

19:41.728 --> 19:45.565
Look. I know your mom
pretty well. She's fine.

19:45.648 --> 19:48.443
I'd be willing to bet
she's just composing herself,

19:48.526 --> 19:50.612
taking a nice, long,
peaceful walk in the park.

19:57.660 --> 20:00.288
[Squirts]

20:00.372 --> 20:03.249
[ Muffled ]
Perfect.

20:03.333 --> 20:07.128
<i>[ Claire ] At that moment all I
wanted was to be with my family.</i>

20:07.212 --> 20:09.714
<i>But of course, that meant
finding a way to apologize...</i>

20:09.798 --> 20:12.801
<i>to the people that
I had belittled and rejected.</i>

20:12.884 --> 20:15.887
- [ Groans] - Okay, you are so
crazy. That song totally rules.

20:16.012 --> 20:18.348
[Alex ] Daddy, you're
crazy. Crazy right.

20:18.473 --> 20:19.724
Hey, honey.
Hi.

20:19.808 --> 20:21.267
<i>[Luke] Hey, Mom.</i>
Come <i>on. Sit</i> down.

20:21.393 --> 20:24.562
<i>No, seriously, Dad. lf's
lame.</i> Seriously, Luke. It's not.

20:24.646 --> 20:26.606
You got some mustard
or something on your face.

20:26.689 --> 20:29.401
I think I know a little bit about
music. I was a deejay in college.

20:29.484 --> 20:31.986
I had my own show—
In the coveted time slot.

20:32.112 --> 20:34.531
<i>Daybreak with Dunph y.
[Haley] Are you kidding me?</i>

20:34.614 --> 20:37.200
No, I'm not kidding you.
And I played Rick Astley.

20:37.325 --> 20:39.953
<i>Dad, that's embarrassing.</i>
Never <i>gonna</i> give— Sing <i>it,</i> Luke.

20:40.036 --> 20:41.955
<i>[ Claire ]
They could have been petty.</i>

20:42.038 --> 20:44.999
<i>They really could have
made me pay, but they didn't.</i>

20:45.083 --> 20:47.001
<i>Never loved 'em more.</i>

20:47.085 --> 20:50.338
Why the hell couldn't Valerie
have seen them like that?

20:53.508 --> 20:59.347
[Man On Phone]
J“ Stars are falling from the sky <i>3</i>

20:59.472 --> 21:02.809
<i>, /' And you're the reason, /'</i>
Hey, Dylan.

21:02.892 --> 21:05.895
- Hey, Mr. Dunphy.
- What's happening?

21:05.979 --> 21:08.022
Well, Haley and I
got into another fight.

21:08.106 --> 21:12.193
<i>Oh— Say Anything.</i>

21:12.277 --> 21:14.571
Um, good morning?

21:14.696 --> 21:18.199
No. Say <i>Anything.</i>
Newspaper.

21:18.283 --> 21:20.743
No, Dylan. <i>Sal/Anything.</i>
Clutch movie.

21:20.827 --> 21:23.037
Clutch movie.

21:23.121 --> 21:26.374
She probably won't be up
for a couple hours still.

21:26.458 --> 21:29.210
It's okay.
It's not that heavy.
