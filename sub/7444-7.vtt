00:16.901 --> 00:18.334
It's a jungle out there.

00:36.821 --> 00:38.459
It's a jungle out there.

00:45.461 --> 00:47.146
Women don't seem to play

00:47.181 --> 00:49.861
much of a role in the underworld.

00:49.896 --> 00:51.854
Fuck! Oh.

00:51.889 --> 00:53.812
Fuck... me.

00:56.861 --> 00:59.861
Oh... ohhh!

01:03.541 --> 01:08.456
Extortion, drug dealing, violence -
they're bloke things.

01:14.861 --> 01:16.341
Is that all the thanks I get?

01:18.501 --> 01:21.141
Oh, my fanny's about to fall out.

01:21.176 --> 01:23.781
Are you gonna drop it in court?

01:23.816 --> 01:25.533
I'm months off, dimbo.

01:26.581 --> 01:28.026
It'd serve the bastards right

01:28.061 --> 01:31.101
if I gushed all over
their fucking floor.

01:31.136 --> 01:33.251
Fucking taking you away from me.

01:35.861 --> 01:37.294
I'm an innocent man.

01:39.061 --> 01:41.529
Don't worry. I'll make bail.

01:50.861 --> 01:52.466
But when the magistrate
didn't believe

01:52.501 --> 01:55.501
the 30,000 ecstasy tablets
found in Carl's possession

01:55.536 --> 01:57.501
were for personal use only,

01:57.536 --> 01:58.946
he was sent to jail,

01:58.981 --> 02:01.426
which meant
his expanding drug business

02:01.461 --> 02:04.339
was left to the care of
his expanding wife...

02:13.061 --> 02:15.861
...which made Roberta Williams
the odd woman out.

02:15.896 --> 02:18.626
She knew exactly
what her old man did for a living,

02:18.661 --> 02:22.370
although I guess she didn't know
the full extent of his dirty deeds.

02:30.741 --> 02:32.226
But most of them -

02:32.261 --> 02:35.241
the wives, lovers,
girlfriends of career criminals -

02:35.276 --> 02:38.221
they either don't have a clue
what their men really do

02:38.256 --> 02:40.261
or they refuse to acknowledge it.

02:40.296 --> 02:42.506
Me, I don't get it.

02:42.541 --> 02:47.181
Why are they attracted to guys who
are bound to end up in jail or worse?

02:47.216 --> 02:49.621
What goes on in their minds,

02:49.656 --> 02:52.215
in their secret hearts?

02:53.701 --> 02:55.146
I don't know.

02:55.181 --> 02:58.461
I suppose every woman's prepared
to pay her own price for love.

02:58.496 --> 03:00.741
I'm sorry. Are you OK?

03:00.776 --> 03:02.186
Keeping busy.

03:02.221 --> 03:04.201
Oh, that brief, I've nearly done it.

03:04.236 --> 03:06.181
Good. Room for one more?
Of course.

03:06.216 --> 03:07.626
Just a DUI.

03:07.661 --> 03:09.301
Favour to a major client -
big Mick Gatto.

03:09.336 --> 03:10.786
Have you met him yet?
No.

03:10.821 --> 03:13.981
Well, he's kind of taken
this bloke under his wing.

03:14.016 --> 03:15.506
Just out of jail

03:15.541 --> 03:17.621
and the idiot sinks
enough piss to break a drought.

03:17.656 --> 03:19.986
And what was he in jail for?
Murder.

03:20.021 --> 03:22.740
And he's waiting for you
in the boardroom.

03:39.221 --> 03:40.746
Hi.
Hi.

03:40.781 --> 03:42.701
I'm Zarah, your lawyer.

03:42.736 --> 03:44.146
G'day.
Hello.

03:44.181 --> 03:46.741
Nice painting.
Thank you.

03:48.021 --> 03:49.721
How am I looking?

03:49.756 --> 03:51.386
Pardon?
The DUI.

03:51.421 --> 03:53.421
How am I looking?
Yes, of course.

03:53.456 --> 03:56.221
Sit down, please.
Right.

03:56.256 --> 03:59.466
OK, um...

03:59.501 --> 04:03.621
Right, now, you had...
How many drinks did you have at...

04:03.656 --> 04:06.421
At Bar 20?
I had three beers, I think.

04:06.456 --> 04:09.618
OK, you breathalysed 0.07.
Yeah.

04:09.653 --> 04:12.746
Look, I'm not used to drinking.

04:12.781 --> 04:16.137
OK, you've been abstinent?
No, I've been inside.

04:18.861 --> 04:20.305
Yes.
For 12 years.

04:20.341 --> 04:23.021
Of course, of course.
Long time between drinks.

04:23.056 --> 04:24.932
Yes.

04:27.381 --> 04:29.337
Oh.

04:33.621 --> 04:36.181
So, what do you reckon?
Can you help us out or what?

04:37.781 --> 04:39.692
Yeah.

04:52.301 --> 04:54.337
That Versace?

04:57.061 --> 05:00.341
You know your dresses.
I'm impressed.

05:00.376 --> 05:01.786
I'm an impressive kind of guy.

05:01.821 --> 05:04.741
You know, Giorgio Armani wants me
to model his new collection.

05:04.776 --> 05:06.811
Mm?
Yeah, for the short fat guy.

05:09.101 --> 05:12.426
Hmm. The salon's going great.
Really good.

05:12.461 --> 05:14.341
Yeah, we're really busy
at the moment. It's great.

05:14.376 --> 05:16.221
Yeah, you know the cash
that goes through there?

05:16.256 --> 05:18.098
It's better than
my other businesses.

05:18.133 --> 05:19.941
Well, maybe you're
in the wrong business.

05:19.976 --> 05:22.461
Yeah, maybe I am.

05:22.496 --> 05:23.946
Hmph.

05:23.981 --> 05:27.610
So how you been?
You know, since Mark?

05:28.661 --> 05:30.981
Do you really care, Tony?

05:31.016 --> 05:33.266
What? About Mark? No, no.

05:33.301 --> 05:36.901
But I bet you didn't get any tea
and biscuits from the Morans either.

05:36.936 --> 05:40.021
Nup. You make your bed,
you lie in it, right?

05:40.056 --> 05:42.626
Tony, it's good to see you.

05:42.661 --> 05:45.141
Oh, g'day, Nik. Hey, nice threads.

05:45.176 --> 05:47.458
You like? It's Versace.
Of course.

05:47.493 --> 05:49.741
They prepared table for us.
Terrific.

05:49.776 --> 05:52.546
Sorry, we're leaving to eat.

05:52.581 --> 05:54.401
You believe how beautiful she is?

05:54.436 --> 05:56.221
Oh...
No, really, she's fucking...

05:56.256 --> 05:57.186
Shut up!

05:57.221 --> 05:58.721
You're embarrassing her.
No.

05:58.756 --> 06:00.221
There's no shame in the truth.

06:00.256 --> 06:01.786
Yeah, yeah.

06:01.821 --> 06:03.306
Let's go, hey?
Yeah.

06:03.341 --> 06:05.781
It was nice talking to you, Tony.
Yeah, yeah.

06:05.816 --> 06:08.659
See you in the salon one day, hey?
Sure.

06:13.941 --> 06:16.146
You like this fat bald man?

06:16.181 --> 06:18.661
Because you are too beautiful
to work in one of his shops.

06:18.696 --> 06:21.506
I mean it.
Oooh! But I like hairdressing.

06:21.541 --> 06:24.461
And I have lots of nasty bills to pay
and I never sweat.

06:24.496 --> 06:25.940
I make you sweat.

06:27.261 --> 06:28.741
Really?
Mm-hm.

06:30.661 --> 06:33.346
Tell me, why are you
called 'The Russian'?

06:33.381 --> 06:35.621
'Cause I've heard that
you're actually from Bulgaria.

06:35.656 --> 06:37.938
Where is bloody Bulgaria?

06:37.973 --> 06:40.221
I don't know.
Nobody knows.

06:40.256 --> 06:42.558
I don't know.

06:42.593 --> 06:44.826
But Russia...

06:44.861 --> 06:47.801
In my business, it helps to...

06:47.836 --> 06:50.706
Hey, hey, arsehole.
Nik...

06:50.741 --> 06:53.381
What? What you look at? What
you doing? You look at my girlfriend?

06:53.416 --> 06:54.826
No, no...
I saw you look.

06:54.861 --> 06:56.581
Nick...
I saw you look at my girl.

06:56.616 --> 06:58.218
No, no.
You want trouble?

06:58.253 --> 06:59.786
I give you fucking trouble.

06:59.821 --> 07:02.301
Next time, you keep
your eyeball for yourself.

07:02.336 --> 07:04.186
Yeah. Sorry.
OK?

07:04.221 --> 07:07.213
Understand? I like you.

07:15.541 --> 07:18.961
Now, the name,
it helps with the business.

07:18.996 --> 07:22.381
People think,
they remember 'The Russian'.

07:22.416 --> 07:24.226
It's better than 'BIow Joggs'.

07:24.261 --> 07:26.461
You mean 'Joe Bloggs'.
Yes, this man.

07:29.981 --> 07:32.381
You like this French bubbles?

07:32.416 --> 07:34.497
Mm. Mmm!

07:36.821 --> 07:38.746
If Carl Williams is gonna come

07:38.781 --> 07:40.661
and sell these things
on my turf, then what?

07:40.696 --> 07:43.306
I'm entitled to a cut?
Yeah.

07:43.341 --> 07:46.746
You know that
and I fucking know that

07:46.781 --> 07:49.261
and that malakia Williams
needs to know it.

07:49.296 --> 07:51.026
You know what I mean?
Relax, will ya?

07:51.061 --> 07:53.821
He's in remand. Just relax.
Yeah, alright, in remand.

07:53.856 --> 07:55.266
It'll be a good chance for you

07:55.301 --> 07:57.769
to lean on his scraggy bitch
of a missus, then, huh?

07:59.901 --> 08:01.346
There she is. Here.

08:01.381 --> 08:03.426
That's your lawyer?
Yep.

08:03.461 --> 08:07.581
You're kidding me. Mate, stick
those norks in my mouth, will ya?

08:07.616 --> 08:09.786
Hi.

08:09.821 --> 08:11.301
I hate these places.

08:11.336 --> 08:13.496
Shall we?

08:15.901 --> 08:18.146
Hey, Lew! Lew!

08:18.181 --> 08:21.601
Good luck, hey?
Hey, sweetheart! Hey!

08:21.636 --> 08:25.021
Want me to check out
your witness box?

08:25.056 --> 08:27.266
Come here.

08:27.301 --> 08:29.021
I'm surprised you've
ever picked up a chick.

08:29.056 --> 08:32.306
She's nice, but.
Yeah, she's nice.

08:32.341 --> 08:35.186
Mate, listen,
do me this favour, alright?

08:35.221 --> 08:39.499
Just go round, have a chat
with puttana, puttana Roberta.

08:40.581 --> 08:44.096
$10,000 a week, bro.
Hey? You go tell her.

08:45.141 --> 08:48.341
No fucking way is Paul Kallipolitis
getting a fucking cent.

08:48.376 --> 08:50.266
He can go fuck himself.

08:50.301 --> 08:53.181
And what are you doing
delivering messages for him anyway?

08:53.216 --> 08:54.626
You know he's serious?

08:54.661 --> 08:57.301
I bet he is. We're making
five times what he does.

08:57.336 --> 08:59.066
Yeah, well,
you should pay it, Roberta.

08:59.101 --> 09:01.261
You know, it's business.
You wanna know about business?

09:01.296 --> 09:03.106
When I grew up, I had nothing.

09:03.141 --> 09:05.101
Now look. This is what
business has bought us.

09:05.136 --> 09:06.666
Me and Carl have worked our tits off

09:06.701 --> 09:08.941
so our kids can have
a home to be proud of.

09:08.976 --> 09:11.181
I was up until
three fucking a.m. This morning

09:11.216 --> 09:12.781
packing these bags for the runners.

09:12.816 --> 09:14.226
Three fucking a.m.

09:14.261 --> 09:16.741
There's no fucking way
I'm sharing my hard-earned cash

09:16.776 --> 09:18.333
with some jumped-up
wog boy from Sunshine.

09:20.661 --> 09:23.221
Present company excepted.

09:26.141 --> 09:28.501
You know he's a fucking psycho?

09:28.536 --> 09:30.219
Oh, he's a fucking joke.

09:35.741 --> 09:38.186
I'm sorry.
I still get to see the sun, don't I?

09:38.221 --> 09:42.181
$3,000 fine and two years
suspended licence is very harsh.

09:42.216 --> 09:45.298
Another lawyer might have been...
You want a chewie?

09:46.461 --> 09:48.531
Yes.

09:50.141 --> 09:53.019
Wanna have a drink sometime?

09:55.781 --> 09:58.106
With you?
Yeah.

09:58.141 --> 10:02.261
No, I didn't mean... I just mean
I don't think that I should.

10:02.296 --> 10:03.819
I'm not supposed to date clients.

10:05.061 --> 10:07.575
What's the worst thing
that could happen, Zarah?

10:28.421 --> 10:30.252
You know, you could've helped,
you lazy bitch.

10:34.981 --> 10:37.786
Fuck off!
Have a go, you fucking slag.

10:37.821 --> 10:40.381
Stick a souvlaki
up your greasy Greek arse.

10:40.416 --> 10:42.417
Come on.
Moll.

10:45.181 --> 10:47.026
HEY!

10:47.061 --> 10:48.901
Get off her!

10:51.261 --> 10:54.281
Give us the fucking money, bitch!

10:54.316 --> 10:57.301
Get off! Get off, get off, get off!

10:57.336 --> 10:58.861
Arggh!
Get off her!

10:58.896 --> 11:01.066
Fucking bitch!

11:01.101 --> 11:04.491
Fucking moll!
You fucking dirty moll!

11:06.221 --> 11:07.266
Fuck!

11:07.301 --> 11:09.895
Hey.

11:11.941 --> 11:16.617
Oh! It's Larry and Curly, huh?
Where's Moe?

11:17.661 --> 11:20.016
Don't want to find my fucking house
burning down around my ears.

11:21.261 --> 11:23.186
All there? Huh?

11:23.221 --> 11:25.981
Don't you fucking touch
my daughter ever again.

11:26.016 --> 11:28.741
Like I'm gonna touch
anything of yours, huh?

11:28.776 --> 11:30.421
I'd be scared
I'd get a disease, mate.

11:30.456 --> 11:32.341
Oh? Give us that, then, huh?

11:36.301 --> 11:37.786
Is she for real?

11:37.821 --> 11:39.826
Huh? Is that moll for real?

11:39.861 --> 11:42.181
You're a dirty moll, mate.
Every week!

11:42.216 --> 11:44.092
Hey! Every week, ya clam!

11:46.941 --> 11:48.466
Jesus, Bobbie.

11:48.501 --> 11:51.098
Don't you say a fucking thing, Carl.

11:51.133 --> 11:53.695
Don't. Don't you say
a fucking thing.

11:55.141 --> 11:58.106
You're in here having
a fucking holiday.

11:58.141 --> 12:00.941
I'm out there with shitheads
terrorising my kid.

12:00.976 --> 12:03.706
Plus, I'm hauling around
your fucking sprog,

12:03.741 --> 12:06.701
which is doing my fucking fanny in,
and my back is fucking killing me

12:06.736 --> 12:08.738
and the house is
a fucking bomb site.

12:08.773 --> 12:10.706
I'm doing my fucking best, alright?

12:10.741 --> 12:12.501
So just say one fucking word,
Carl Williams,

12:12.536 --> 12:13.946
and I'm gonna jump across this table

12:13.981 --> 12:15.972
and I'm gonna feed you
your skinny fucking balls.

12:20.701 --> 12:23.215
Ain't got nothing to fucking say?
I'll fuck off, then.

12:27.061 --> 12:29.401
She made a smart business decision.

12:29.436 --> 12:31.508
10 grand a week to that woggy prick?

12:31.543 --> 12:33.546
Mate, if I wasn't stuck in here...

12:33.581 --> 12:36.812
You're only stuck, Carl, if that's
the way you choose to look at it.

12:37.861 --> 12:42.261
I made some of the best connections
of my life right here in the boob.

12:42.296 --> 12:45.981
There's a lot of people in here
worth getting to know, Carl.

12:46.016 --> 12:48.506
Hey, are you listening?

12:48.541 --> 12:52.170
You should listen to Uncle Tone.
I'm your fairy godmother.

12:53.661 --> 12:57.415
See you all.
See you. Don't have too much fun.

13:00.301 --> 13:03.186
Yeah. I'm gonna go. See you.

13:03.221 --> 13:06.418
Visit from the boss.
Aren't we honoured!

13:10.501 --> 13:12.696
For you.
Gerberas.

13:15.181 --> 13:18.146
And champagne. Tony.

13:18.181 --> 13:20.261
Why don't you come
and have dinner with me?

13:20.296 --> 13:22.980
We'll go somewhere nice and stuck-up.

13:24.941 --> 13:27.091
I guess I could squeeze you
on my dance card.

13:29.341 --> 13:31.809
Then you'll need, uh...
You'll need this.

13:34.461 --> 13:35.894
Nice.

14:19.061 --> 14:20.826
Arggh!

14:20.861 --> 14:22.613
Knew you were gonna do that.

14:37.461 --> 14:38.689
Arggh!

14:45.541 --> 14:46.974
Arggh!

14:48.221 --> 14:49.973
Fuck!

14:54.981 --> 14:56.866
You like hairdressing?

14:56.901 --> 15:00.221
You know, you are the second man
to ask me that lately.

15:00.256 --> 15:01.786
Yeah, I do.

15:01.821 --> 15:04.581
I'm exceptionally good at it.

15:04.616 --> 15:07.018
Ha. I bet you are.

15:07.053 --> 15:09.386
What about the future?

15:09.421 --> 15:13.306
You know, like marriage, babies.

15:13.341 --> 15:16.741
You know, most women want
some sort of security, don't they?

15:16.776 --> 15:19.986
Yeah, in my own way, I suppose.

15:20.021 --> 15:22.621
Ah. With a rich
gangster prince, right?

15:22.656 --> 15:24.946
Yeah.

15:24.981 --> 15:26.981
He's got to be a sweetheart.

15:27.016 --> 15:28.226
A sweetheart?
Mmm.

15:28.261 --> 15:31.261
You mean,
like a stupid, lanky Russian one

15:31.296 --> 15:35.386
or a cuddly, smart Kuwaiti one?

15:35.421 --> 15:38.080
I thought
you were Lebanese.

15:38.115 --> 15:40.739
Yeah. It's a long story.
Right.

15:41.821 --> 15:45.097
Seriously, Danni,
you're a beautiful woman.

15:47.661 --> 15:49.379
You deserve someone
with better prospects.

15:50.901 --> 15:53.741
Prospects? Prospects are good.

15:53.776 --> 15:55.174
Yeah.

15:56.541 --> 15:59.541
So, are you worried about
these drug-trafficking charges?

15:59.576 --> 16:04.866
Listen, whatever life throws my way,

16:04.901 --> 16:07.101
I'll just make the best
of it, you know?

16:07.136 --> 16:10.013
Always have. That's me.

16:11.901 --> 16:13.732
Just suck it and see, eh?

16:16.301 --> 16:17.780
Yeah.

17:23.941 --> 17:27.058
Hi there.
You've got no new messages.

17:39.901 --> 17:42.335
What's the worst thing
that could happen, Zarah?

18:01.181 --> 18:05.015
So, Danielle, I have something.

18:06.141 --> 18:09.338
Just a little something for you.
Oh, Nik.

18:10.381 --> 18:13.186
You are spoiling me.
No.

18:13.221 --> 18:16.021
I would like to spoil you more.

18:16.056 --> 18:17.454
Hmm?

18:18.861 --> 18:20.346
Nik, Nik.

18:20.381 --> 18:21.826
Good things...

18:21.861 --> 18:23.866
Good things come
to those who wait, OK?

18:23.901 --> 18:26.421
How much longer are you
gonna make me wait, huh?

18:26.456 --> 18:28.906
I'm just a poor little girl
in a big bad forest.

18:28.941 --> 18:31.933
I've got to look out for big bad
wolves who want to eat me up.

18:33.021 --> 18:35.781
You should be careful.
I will eat you.

18:35.816 --> 18:38.386
Probably. Maybe.

18:38.421 --> 18:40.537
If you play your cards right.

18:41.661 --> 18:45.654
Hey. Thanks for tea.

18:48.381 --> 18:49.866
Hey, angel face.

18:49.901 --> 18:53.496
I got a big surprise for you.

18:54.901 --> 18:56.501
A big surprise coming up.

18:56.536 --> 18:57.946
Really?
Yeah.

18:57.981 --> 19:00.021
You will like. I promise.

19:00.056 --> 19:02.137
Goodnight, Nik.

19:48.941 --> 19:51.409
Your fairy godmother says hello.

20:14.781 --> 20:17.141
That's her.
Right there, right there.

20:17.176 --> 20:20.341
Hey! Valet parking, huh?

20:20.376 --> 20:22.226
Jesus Christ! What?

20:22.261 --> 20:26.381
Are you having triplets?
Where's the money? Huh?

20:26.416 --> 20:29.386
Yeah, yeah - right here. Ah! Count it.

20:29.421 --> 20:31.541
You know, for a bloke
who shoots up horse hormones,

20:31.576 --> 20:33.020
you got an awfully small dick.

20:34.501 --> 20:35.946
You know, I hear
Carl's doing alright.

20:35.981 --> 20:39.741
Yeah. No, he does his time good.
Yeah, yeah.

20:39.776 --> 20:41.706
Must be all those whores

20:41.741 --> 20:43.946
I hear he's been
having smuggled into his cell, huh?

20:43.981 --> 20:47.821
One by one, mate. 'Cause, you know,
you're preggers and everything.

20:47.856 --> 20:49.459
Have a nice day.

21:30.861 --> 21:32.374
Voila!

21:33.541 --> 21:35.259
Nik!

21:36.541 --> 21:38.106
Wow!

21:38.141 --> 21:40.881
This one - 100% Danish.
Duck feather.

21:40.916 --> 21:43.586
This one. Imported from Copenhagen.

21:43.621 --> 21:46.261
You know Helena Christensen?
She sleep on that.

21:46.296 --> 21:47.306
Really?

21:47.341 --> 21:51.021
And this one. You feel this, please.
It's soft.

21:51.056 --> 21:53.941
This import from Milan.
Milan?

21:53.976 --> 21:55.626
Milan.
Milan.

21:55.661 --> 21:58.706
Only one in the country.

21:58.741 --> 22:02.021
Soft, eh?
Oh, that feels beautiful!

22:02.056 --> 22:04.094
Mmm.
Is that marble?

22:04.129 --> 22:06.133
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:07.621 --> 22:09.621
This is chirtzo.

22:09.656 --> 22:11.621
I love marble.

22:11.656 --> 22:12.786
You like?

22:12.821 --> 22:16.781
Like? Nik, it's a freakin' palace!

22:16.816 --> 22:18.226
Yeah, it's palace.

22:18.261 --> 22:21.121
For you... my princess.

22:21.156 --> 22:23.946
What?!

22:23.981 --> 22:26.461
You mean I can live here?

22:26.496 --> 22:28.106
Mmm, no. Next door.

22:28.141 --> 22:31.141
Of course you live here.

22:31.176 --> 22:34.106
Huh?
Oh, my... God!

22:34.141 --> 22:36.746
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
So, what...

22:36.781 --> 22:41.061
So are you gonna throw in a car
so I can drive to work, huh?

22:41.096 --> 22:43.186
Work? What for you work?

22:43.221 --> 22:45.181
You gonna make me take a tram?

22:45.216 --> 22:47.141
No, you don't work.

22:47.176 --> 22:50.106
Hmm?

22:50.141 --> 22:52.186
I look after you...

22:52.221 --> 22:57.818
<i>... and all those "nasty little bills".</i>

22:59.421 --> 23:01.306
You'd do all that for me?

23:01.341 --> 23:04.781
Angelucci, I spend money
on beautiful thing.

23:04.816 --> 23:07.614
This make me happy. Hmm?

23:08.661 --> 23:10.866
And now...

23:10.901 --> 23:13.938
<i>... you make me... very happy.</i>

23:15.221 --> 23:16.939
Ow! Nik!

23:18.181 --> 23:20.306
Niki! Not yet.

23:20.341 --> 23:22.741
No fucking "Not yet".

23:22.776 --> 23:25.106
Nyet to "Not yet".

23:25.141 --> 23:26.981
It is finished now - you tease my prick.

23:27.016 --> 23:30.291
OK. It's OK. Just relax, hmm?

23:36.941 --> 23:38.421
Nik!

23:38.456 --> 23:39.866
Nik...

23:39.901 --> 23:42.941
Yeah, come on. You will like.
Please.

23:42.976 --> 23:44.374
Don't.

24:04.501 --> 24:06.492
We're closed.

24:07.941 --> 24:10.316
You couldn't squeeze me in,
could you?

24:10.351 --> 24:12.692
I, uh, got all this hair in my eyes.

24:20.941 --> 24:22.374
You seem sad.

24:24.261 --> 24:26.226
I'm just thinking.

24:26.261 --> 24:28.221
Can I make a suggestion?

24:28.256 --> 24:30.706
Shoot.

24:30.741 --> 24:33.266
You're a good cutter, Danielle.

24:33.301 --> 24:34.901
I mean, that's at least what I heard.

24:37.381 --> 24:40.461
But, I mean, have you ever thought
about managing a place like this?

24:40.496 --> 24:42.181
We've already got a manager.

24:42.216 --> 24:44.626
Yeah.

24:44.661 --> 24:46.413
But what if I want a new one?

24:48.141 --> 24:49.586
Hey?

24:49.621 --> 24:51.746
How about it, Danni?

24:51.781 --> 24:55.106
What? You want me
to manage this place?

24:55.141 --> 24:58.541
Yeah, yeah. You could hire,
fire, redecorate, if you want.

24:58.576 --> 25:01.374
I mean, I trust your judgment.

25:05.821 --> 25:07.300
OK.

25:08.741 --> 25:10.732
So, what's the catch?

25:12.701 --> 25:16.621
Oh, if we was to screw each other's
brains out every now and again,

25:16.656 --> 25:18.054
I wouldn't say no.

25:29.621 --> 25:31.930
Hello.
Angelucci.

25:33.901 --> 25:35.621
Come on. Let's go, huh?

25:35.656 --> 25:37.418
Um, Nik, I...

25:39.141 --> 25:40.586
Oh, what's this?

25:40.621 --> 25:42.226
It's cherry slivovitz.

25:42.261 --> 25:44.661
Ooh!
It's a Bulgarian liqueur.

25:44.696 --> 25:46.701
And this.

25:48.301 --> 25:53.181
It's to say thank you...
and, um, goodbye.

25:53.216 --> 25:55.506
Hmm.

25:55.541 --> 26:00.701
You have been such a generous man,
Nik, and I've really enjoyed myself.

26:00.736 --> 26:03.381
But, um...
But what?

26:03.416 --> 26:06.118
You know...

26:06.153 --> 26:08.820
What is this?

26:16.381 --> 26:19.100
You don't
give me fucking present! I do!

26:20.861 --> 26:23.280
Who the fuck you think you are?!

26:23.315 --> 26:25.700
Who the fuck
you think you are?!

26:29.381 --> 26:31.061
You are fucking nothing!
Nik...

26:31.096 --> 26:32.066
Nobody!

26:32.101 --> 26:35.041
You are fucking hairdresser.

26:35.076 --> 26:37.981
Woman! You're fucking nothing!

26:38.016 --> 26:39.781
Fucking WHORE!

26:41.261 --> 26:43.695
Ow!

26:47.341 --> 26:48.820
OK, good.

26:51.661 --> 26:53.094
I hate your face.

27:35.181 --> 27:37.217
Bottoms up.
Titties down.

27:38.701 --> 27:40.546
Ah!

27:40.581 --> 27:42.706
You're bad.
Yeah.

27:42.741 --> 27:44.777
I'm really, really bad.

27:47.861 --> 27:49.706
Hey, Tiff. Hey.

27:49.741 --> 27:53.021
You know, after he's had a few,
it's about this big, yeah?

27:53.056 --> 27:54.741
It's like a limp biscuit...

27:54.776 --> 27:57.106
Arggh! Ar-ar-ar!

27:57.141 --> 27:59.386
It's true.
That true?

27:59.421 --> 28:01.306
Look at you. You're a poofter.

28:01.341 --> 28:03.861
Hey, least I don't
have to root goats.

28:03.896 --> 28:05.861
Root what? Who's rooting goats?

28:05.896 --> 28:07.546
Get fucked.
Hey!

28:07.581 --> 28:10.421
Hey, hey, hey! Say sorry to her.
Hey. Hey, play nicely.

28:10.456 --> 28:12.173
We're only mucking around.
Fucking apologise!

28:16.061 --> 28:17.981
You alright? Huh?
Yeah.

28:18.016 --> 28:19.901
Everything alright?
Yeah.

28:19.936 --> 28:21.346
Did I hurt you?
Nah.

28:21.381 --> 28:23.861
Nah? Alright? Come on, man. Happy?

28:23.896 --> 28:26.421
You wanna rumba, sexy?
Mmm.

28:46.581 --> 28:48.666
Hello? Hey?

28:48.701 --> 28:51.090
Roberta? Yeah,
I'll be there in a minute. OK.

28:53.181 --> 28:54.899
Come here.

28:59.781 --> 29:01.861
Hey, where are you going?
Stay there, alright?

29:01.896 --> 29:04.694
Don't go away. Alright?

29:11.461 --> 29:15.056
Tiff, what are you doing? Come.
Are you just gonna stand there?

29:22.621 --> 29:25.089
You want a chewie?

29:42.901 --> 29:44.971
Hello, Lew.

29:47.821 --> 29:50.186
Hey.
How'd you meet Mr Gatto?

29:50.221 --> 29:54.061
I was inside with Jason Moran,
and I was looking out for him.

29:54.096 --> 29:56.701
So he then put in
a word with Mick and...

29:56.736 --> 29:58.466
Looked out for him how?

29:58.501 --> 30:00.386
Well, you know, he's like 5'8"

30:00.421 --> 30:02.841
with this huge ego
and even bigger mouth, so...

30:02.876 --> 30:05.261
...blokes are lining up
to kick his head in.

30:05.296 --> 30:07.786
I stopped them, that's all.

30:07.821 --> 30:10.181
What do you actually do
for Mr Gatto?

30:10.216 --> 30:13.253
Uh... pick up stuff, drop it off.

30:14.781 --> 30:16.466
OK, yeah.
Yeah.

30:16.501 --> 30:18.651
Not gonna be a delivery boy forever.

30:20.541 --> 30:23.141
Nah, of course not.
Heaps of stuff I can do.

30:23.176 --> 30:24.586
It's just...
Yeah.

30:24.621 --> 30:27.454
It's kind of hard when you've
only done physical kind of work.

30:29.941 --> 30:33.058
Could be a model.
Heh. YOU could be a model.

30:36.861 --> 30:39.261
It'd be good, I reckon,
poncing around in your undies,

30:39.296 --> 30:41.855
you know, holding toasters,
opening fridge doors.

30:44.741 --> 30:46.941
I take photos, actually.

30:46.976 --> 30:49.141
Oh, yeah? Anything good?

30:49.176 --> 30:50.946
Yeah.
Yeah?

30:50.981 --> 30:54.321
Yeah, I'm not an expert or anything,

30:54.356 --> 30:57.661
but I could maybe
take some of you...

30:57.696 --> 30:59.558
<i>... if you want.</i>

30:59.593 --> 31:01.386
The light's good.

31:01.421 --> 31:03.981
Kind of over here. Yeah.

31:04.016 --> 31:05.741
It's good. OK.

31:05.776 --> 31:07.746
Alright.

31:07.781 --> 31:09.897
Hmm.

31:21.941 --> 31:24.141
It's nice.
What do you want me to do?

31:24.176 --> 31:25.893
Want me to...
It's great.

31:27.981 --> 31:31.735
Want me to take off my jacket?
Yeah. Yeah.

31:47.661 --> 31:49.174
Take your shirt off.

32:09.021 --> 32:10.215
Hmm.

33:53.501 --> 33:55.906
You know, after all
I've done for the fat toad,

33:55.941 --> 33:59.536
and he goes and sticks his cock
into some dirty whores.

34:02.021 --> 34:07.541
I'm sorry, Benj.
Hey, dollybird, don't stress.

34:07.576 --> 34:10.438
I don't know what I'd do without you.

34:10.473 --> 34:13.301
Got no other fucking friends.

34:18.221 --> 34:19.893
Hey, I got you something.

34:21.741 --> 34:23.426
Huh?

34:23.460 --> 34:25.985
Little spoonful.

34:26.021 --> 34:28.501
Here we go. Come on, lift it up.

34:28.536 --> 34:31.545
Hah.
Mmm.

34:31.581 --> 34:35.701
Mmm. You're a fucking
legend, you truly are.

34:35.735 --> 34:37.505
It's better than sex, isn't it?

34:37.541 --> 34:40.460
Oh, yeah, and, uh... you
want that in the freezer?

34:40.496 --> 34:41.974
No. Fucking give it here.

34:43.261 --> 34:46.094
You know how long it is
since I've had a drink?

34:53.900 --> 34:55.458
Who are you hanging with tonight?

34:57.941 --> 35:00.746
Uh... PK.

35:00.781 --> 35:03.066
Fucking P fucking K.

35:03.101 --> 35:06.138
Keeps making my life a misery.

35:07.701 --> 35:10.576
You know, the world would
be a better fucking place

35:10.611 --> 35:13.452
if he just did us a favour
and fucked off it for good.

35:18.581 --> 35:21.061
Hey, Roberta,
have you got any, uh...

35:21.096 --> 35:23.506
So that's what you're after, is it?

35:23.541 --> 35:25.941
Got a lady. I need
a little cha-cha-cha!

35:25.976 --> 35:26.930
Shift over.

36:26.381 --> 36:27.939
Fuck!

36:41.021 --> 36:43.541
Shut up.

36:45.061 --> 36:46.546
Fuck.

36:46.581 --> 36:48.781
Oh, you like it like that, huh?

36:48.816 --> 36:50.981
You like it like that, huh?

36:51.016 --> 36:53.386
Come here. Oh.

36:53.421 --> 36:56.458
Oh, your tits. Oh, they're beautiful.

36:58.221 --> 37:00.018
That's it. That's it, that's it.

37:01.341 --> 37:02.346
Right there.

37:02.381 --> 37:05.261
Jeez, if a girl wants a root,
she's gotta do it herself.

37:05.296 --> 37:07.491
Shut up.
Let me come in peace, will you?

37:08.701 --> 37:11.861
Give me some of that pot you promised,
and I'll blow you next.

37:11.896 --> 37:14.346
Really?
Yeah.

37:14.381 --> 37:16.786
What about blowing me now?

37:16.821 --> 37:18.586
Where you going? Where you going?

37:18.621 --> 37:21.301
You're leaving me with blue balls,
mate. What are you doing?

37:21.336 --> 37:24.026
What are you doing?
Dunny through here?

37:24.061 --> 37:26.940
Yeah, just through there.
Mate, you're a prick tease.

37:26.975 --> 37:29.820
I'm hung and hard like a donkey,
mate. Where you going?

37:38.541 --> 37:39.610
Hey.

37:45.661 --> 37:46.616
Oh!

38:30.061 --> 38:31.779
Thank you.
Mm-hm.

38:36.781 --> 38:39.500
Boss.
What have you got for me?

38:41.221 --> 38:44.581
Paul Kallipolitis - ran most
of the drug trade in Sunshine.

38:44.616 --> 38:46.261
Another one
for the whiteboard.

38:46.296 --> 38:48.038
Get anything from the neighbours?

38:48.073 --> 38:49.746
Nah, no-one saw or heard anything.

38:49.781 --> 38:51.621
They must sleep heavy
in west Sunshine.

38:51.656 --> 38:53.054
Aren't they lucky?

38:54.341 --> 38:56.252
Hey. Tiffany?

38:59.101 --> 39:00.861
This is Detective Inspector
Butterworth.

39:00.896 --> 39:02.426
Have they taken him away yet?

39:02.461 --> 39:04.301
Not until Forensics
are finished with him.

39:04.336 --> 39:06.292
Did you see who did this, Tiffany?

39:07.861 --> 39:11.181
I'm not signing a statement.
Not going to court.

39:11.216 --> 39:13.901
Now, anything you give us is great.

39:13.936 --> 39:16.106
I didn't see the shooting.

39:16.141 --> 39:19.661
I only heard it, and then I saw
someone leave. That's all.

39:19.696 --> 39:21.174
Who did you see?

39:23.461 --> 39:24.894
Hey?

39:29.661 --> 39:33.781
His friend. I only met him tonight.

39:33.816 --> 39:35.897
Does this friend have a name?

39:42.021 --> 39:45.181
Benji.
Benji who?

39:45.216 --> 39:47.092
I don't know.

39:48.541 --> 39:50.452
He seemed a real sweetie.

39:54.341 --> 39:57.141
Aw. Hey, yeah,
it's OK, little bubba.

39:57.176 --> 39:58.906
It's alright, Dhakota.

39:58.941 --> 40:01.661
You do have a way with
the girls, don't you, Benj?

40:01.696 --> 40:06.018
Yeah, I got a way with everybody.
Oh, hello.

40:07.541 --> 40:09.821
Oh, she's so beautiful.
Oh, yeah.

40:09.856 --> 40:11.266
There you go.
Aw.

40:11.301 --> 40:13.101
Yeah.
There you go, bubba.

40:13.136 --> 40:14.866
Did you hear about poor old PK?

40:14.901 --> 40:17.381
He was cut down
in his fucking prime.

40:17.416 --> 40:19.258
Tragic, eh?
Yeah.

40:21.341 --> 40:23.961
Yeah.
Yeah.

40:23.996 --> 40:26.546
It's a tragedy.

40:26.581 --> 40:28.561
Women who survive in the underworld

40:28.596 --> 40:30.506
have to have
the gift of looking away

40:30.541 --> 40:33.701
and choosing what to see,
what to hear, what to say.

40:33.736 --> 40:36.741
They have to be wise monkeys -

40:36.776 --> 40:39.358
see no evil,

40:39.393 --> 40:42.307
hear no evil,

40:42.342 --> 40:45.221
speak no evil.

40:48.541 --> 40:54.457
# Hide and seek is the game

40:57.621 --> 41:03.457
# We'll teach you how to play

41:05.341 --> 41:07.901
# Close your eyes

41:09.661 --> 41:11.936
# Really tight

41:14.541 --> 41:17.180
# Make it dark

41:18.741 --> 41:21.414
# Like the night

41:25.421 --> 41:27.661
# The party never ends

41:27.696 --> 41:29.938
# The game begins again

41:29.973 --> 41:32.174
# The party never ends

41:32.209 --> 41:34.376
# The game begins again

41:51.261 --> 41:56.858
# Climb the stairs to the top

42:00.421 --> 42:05.973
# Rooms are dark but don't stop

42:08.181 --> 42:10.979
# Getting close

42:12.381 --> 42:14.895
# Really warm

42:17.421 --> 42:20.254
# Now you're cold

42:21.581 --> 42:24.049
# On the floor... #

42:25.305 --> 42:31.393
