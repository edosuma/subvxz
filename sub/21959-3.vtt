WEBVTT

00:06.156 --> 00:07.588
Previously on Bad Blood.

00:08.070 --> 00:10.837
I want to legitimize our
interests across the board.

00:10.906 --> 00:12.187
Slowly pull back.

00:12.573 --> 00:14.072
You work for the gangsters.

00:15.289 --> 00:17.022
I work for the neighborhood.

00:17.546 --> 00:19.748
Mr. Rizzuto? We're here to
place you under arrest.

00:19.773 --> 00:21.260
What the hell's going on?

00:21.329 --> 00:22.772
They're coming at us from all sides.

00:22.796 --> 00:24.196
I'm talking about my son.

00:24.264 --> 00:26.209
He's getting it out there
that he's heir to the throne.

00:26.233 --> 00:27.543
We have some business to discuss.

00:27.567 --> 00:29.134
I told you I'm not paying anymore.

00:30.383 --> 00:31.627
The only way that people will be certain

00:31.651 --> 00:34.459
that Vito Rizzuto is
still on top of everything

00:34.484 --> 00:37.719
is that if a Rizzuto is
there to say it for him!

00:38.821 --> 00:40.666
If I run away and hide, they're
gonna think we're scared.

00:40.690 --> 00:43.291
Don't you dare try to blame my son.

00:43.359 --> 00:44.718
- You understand?
- Yes.

00:44.743 --> 00:45.908
Yes, boss!

00:45.933 --> 00:47.165
Yes, sir!

00:47.228 --> 00:50.028
Whatever it takes
to remind you of your place.

00:50.132 --> 00:51.312
Yes, boss.

02:04.195 --> 02:05.327
Did anything happen?

02:21.865 --> 02:22.865
Morning.

03:06.063 --> 03:07.095
I'm Luke.

03:07.120 --> 03:08.386
I've heard of you.

03:09.081 --> 03:10.429
I heard of you.

03:14.921 --> 03:16.078
So, you're the guy?

03:17.051 --> 03:18.164
What guy?

03:18.638 --> 03:19.625
The guy!

03:19.650 --> 03:20.867
Mr. Big Mafia Don!

03:21.319 --> 03:24.656
Look I think, somebody gave you

03:24.681 --> 03:26.640
some misinformation to, um,

03:27.508 --> 03:29.241
confuse or embarrass you.

03:29.515 --> 03:30.642
I don't know.

03:32.613 --> 03:34.070
You don't want to push me.

03:34.569 --> 03:36.669
I don't even know
what we're talking about.

03:38.406 --> 03:41.039
We're the only ones
who can keep you safe.

03:42.017 --> 03:43.349
Why is that?

03:44.697 --> 03:46.007
'Cause we're the same.

03:49.150 --> 03:50.694
You and me, we're the same?

03:51.298 --> 03:54.299
You mean, 'cause
'cause we're white?

03:56.789 --> 04:00.164
Other than that I can assure
you we are not the same.

04:01.374 --> 04:03.796
We need to make arrangements
with your people.

04:05.763 --> 04:07.218
You're a smart guy,

04:08.888 --> 04:10.454
you know how this works.

04:12.218 --> 04:14.018
Um, who should I tell them is calling?

04:14.043 --> 04:15.963
'Cause, you know, I
forgot your name already?

04:18.983 --> 04:20.046
Luke.

04:20.492 --> 04:22.492
Just Luke that's all you need.

04:22.654 --> 04:24.382
Listen, Luke.

04:26.265 --> 04:28.432
My friends, my very good friends

04:28.500 --> 04:31.718
from Chicago, New York, New Jersey...

04:32.418 --> 04:33.484
Um...

04:34.907 --> 04:36.606
They don't like to do
business that way.

04:36.675 --> 04:39.342
They don't like to be told
who they have to work with

04:39.411 --> 04:41.010
or not work with.

04:41.079 --> 04:43.246
You know, that's just the way they work.

04:43.315 --> 04:44.484
And to be honest,

04:45.316 --> 04:48.817
I don't even know, you know,
what they have organized.

04:51.101 --> 04:52.382
But I do know this...

04:55.293 --> 04:58.328
They have a long memory

04:59.581 --> 05:02.906
for anybody who hurts one of their own.

05:09.367 --> 05:12.156
- Nice speech, old man.
- Yeah, I thought so.

05:39.589 --> 05:40.960
How could this happen?

05:42.554 --> 05:44.593
We arranged security through New York.

05:45.375 --> 05:47.353
It's obviously some
kind of miscommunication

05:47.377 --> 05:48.984
and someone dropped the ball.

05:49.333 --> 05:50.554
Do you understand

05:51.700 --> 05:53.101
how this makes us look?

05:54.578 --> 05:58.648
I mean, if we can't
even protect our boss,

05:59.304 --> 06:02.005
what makes our partners think
that we can protect them?

06:03.668 --> 06:05.007
My next question,

06:05.632 --> 06:07.531
this miscommunication problem...

06:09.062 --> 06:15.226
do you, do you think it was a
screwup or a... or a message?

06:15.601 --> 06:19.976
I don't think it was a move against
us, but I can't be 100% certain.

06:20.386 --> 06:21.586
Now, you find out!

06:26.320 --> 06:27.914
- Well, we need certainty.
- Yeah.

06:27.982 --> 06:29.249
So, you want me to handle it?

06:29.317 --> 06:31.187
No, I'll take care of it,
I'll take care of it.

06:32.171 --> 06:34.987
Okay, let me tell you about my night.

06:35.057 --> 06:40.000
So, I had to meet with
the dear Inspector Aucoin.

06:40.991 --> 06:42.391
Guess what he wanted to talk about?

06:43.304 --> 06:44.363
Nico.

06:44.625 --> 06:46.367
Nico's the problem right now.

06:46.434 --> 06:47.533
Yeah, I know.

06:47.728 --> 06:48.894
No, no, you don't.

06:48.963 --> 06:50.629
If you did that kid would be hamstrung

06:50.697 --> 06:52.597
and locked in a basement
until Vito got out.

06:52.666 --> 06:53.966
Can't exactly do that.

06:55.158 --> 06:57.584
You know, there's nothing
more dangerous to an operation

06:57.609 --> 06:59.414
than to trust somebody
who can't be sensible.

06:59.439 --> 07:01.205
And that kid has no sense about him.

07:01.275 --> 07:03.273
- It'll be taken care of.
- It better be.

07:03.744 --> 07:05.677
Or someone else will take care of it.

07:07.514 --> 07:09.648
And then, I had to talk to Jacques.

07:09.716 --> 07:11.249
Guess what he wanted to talk about?

07:13.090 --> 07:15.523
So that little shit thinks
he's the new boss?

07:15.655 --> 07:17.789
The king dies so, he takes his throne.

07:18.825 --> 07:20.265
- This isn't England.
- No.

07:20.382 --> 07:23.468
It's not England and he is
an obnoxious little shit!

07:23.906 --> 07:26.350
Stop making excuses for him
like he's eight years old.

07:26.375 --> 07:28.010
If he wasn't Vito's kid,
he'd be dead already.

07:28.034 --> 07:29.700
Hey, hey, you can't talk that way.

07:29.769 --> 07:32.248
He's completely untouchable,
that's right from Vito.

07:32.280 --> 07:33.749
- Well, Vito ain't here.
- Yes, he is.

07:33.773 --> 07:35.953
When you're talking to me
you're talking to Vito.

07:36.178 --> 07:39.140
- Do we understand each other?
- Do we understand...

07:40.226 --> 07:42.078
I don't work for Vito,
I'm a goddamn partner

07:42.147 --> 07:44.315
so, you speak to me
like I'm a goddamn partner.

07:44.383 --> 07:45.663
Or you won't speak to me at all.

07:45.718 --> 07:46.883
Take it easy.

07:47.625 --> 07:48.679
Take it easy.

07:49.288 --> 07:50.568
We're on the same page, Jacques.

07:51.370 --> 07:53.037
Just because you repeat Vito's words

07:53.062 --> 07:54.406
doesn't make you a boss.

07:54.693 --> 07:56.059
You gotta earn my respect.

07:56.128 --> 07:57.710
It doesn't get handed to you.

07:59.257 --> 08:00.703
Do we understand each other?

08:04.039 --> 08:05.304
Get him what he wants.

08:05.373 --> 08:06.839
And then after Jacques,

08:06.908 --> 08:08.374
I met with the Haitians,

08:08.443 --> 08:10.843
I met with the Irish, so before...

08:11.234 --> 08:14.714
I could go home
and down a bottle of rye,

08:14.783 --> 08:17.523
forty ounce, and knock myself
into oblivion,

08:17.571 --> 08:20.806
I get a call about
the little prince himself.

08:41.041 --> 08:42.674
- How you doing, Louis?
- Good.

08:42.743 --> 08:43.976
- Good.
- How you doing?

08:44.044 --> 08:45.724
- How long's he been in there?
- All night.

08:49.882 --> 08:51.789
- Hey, hey!
- Hey!

08:52.645 --> 08:53.750
There he is!

08:54.133 --> 08:55.693
Do you know who this guy is? This is...

08:55.992 --> 08:58.802
This is my father's
favorite illegitimate son.

08:58.871 --> 09:00.093
Hey, out!

09:00.453 --> 09:02.773
- Get outta here, beat it.
- All right.

09:03.320 --> 09:04.652
Hey, girls!

09:04.676 --> 09:06.609
Un, deux, trois, quatre. Out!

09:06.678 --> 09:08.011
Out, out, out!

09:08.080 --> 09:09.813
- Louis help her out.
- Come on let's go.

09:09.882 --> 09:13.140
- No, no, no, no...
- Out! Let's go. Let's go.

09:13.229 --> 09:14.663
Out.

09:21.045 --> 09:22.412
What are you doing?

09:22.437 --> 09:23.953
This is my personal time!

09:23.978 --> 09:26.211
I promised your father
that I would make

09:26.223 --> 09:28.195
sure no one else tried to kill you.

09:28.375 --> 09:30.734
You didn't promise him
no one would kill me,

09:31.302 --> 09:33.539
you just promised him
that no one would try.

09:33.593 --> 09:35.460
Stop. Stop.

09:35.807 --> 09:38.174
I spent the whole night
with our partners,

09:38.390 --> 09:41.177
assuring them that you're not
gonna cause any more trouble.

09:41.245 --> 09:42.562
Okay.

09:42.789 --> 09:44.625
What kind of trouble would that be?

09:46.116 --> 09:49.050
Someone tries to kill you
and you come to a club.

09:49.335 --> 09:52.640
You need to be laying low
at home, with your wife.

09:53.156 --> 09:54.250
And your kids!

09:57.057 --> 09:58.156
Louis!

09:59.449 --> 10:00.679
See Declan out.

10:05.055 --> 10:06.587
What are you waiting for?

10:06.851 --> 10:08.898
Louis knows who signs his checks.

10:09.062 --> 10:11.192
No, no, no, no, no!

10:11.261 --> 10:13.539
Bullshit! Bullshit! No!

10:13.863 --> 10:15.718
Okay, you work for me personally now,

10:15.804 --> 10:18.695
I'm gonna pay you outta my
personal account, okay?

10:19.109 --> 10:20.312
If you want that goddamn raise...

10:20.336 --> 10:22.092
I'm sending five more guys to help you.

10:22.117 --> 10:24.071
I want you to encircle him.

10:24.140 --> 10:26.820
Every time he moves,
pisses, takes a shit,

10:27.031 --> 10:29.444
you don't take your eyes off him 24/7.

10:29.512 --> 10:31.446
Now, get him out.

10:36.171 --> 10:37.695
We have two priorities.

10:38.684 --> 10:41.632
Protect the boss, and keep Nico safe.

10:46.312 --> 10:47.611
You understand?

11:12.046 --> 11:14.828
Well, I gotta say, you're smooth, pops.

11:32.513 --> 11:33.879
You're in our way bro.

11:44.052 --> 11:45.835
You don't want none of this, Luke.

12:05.271 --> 12:08.250
Mr. Rizzuto, I brought
you an extra JellO.

12:08.625 --> 12:10.046
I heard you like the strawberry.

12:11.932 --> 12:12.999
Thank you.

12:15.789 --> 12:16.945
What's your name?

12:17.800 --> 12:18.820
Marlon.

12:19.702 --> 12:22.469
You are not to worry about nothing
from now on, Mr. Rizzuto.

12:25.574 --> 12:27.039
Nice to meet you, Marlon.

12:32.242 --> 12:33.741
Nico, you can't do this anymore.

12:35.311 --> 12:37.988
You go out at night to nightclubs,
you talk your head off.

12:38.013 --> 12:39.191
Somebody's gonna hear something.

12:39.215 --> 12:40.562
Nonno, I can't go out?

12:40.617 --> 12:43.984
No, you can go out, but you have
a responsibility to your family,

12:44.053 --> 12:45.620
and you can't help them if you're dead.

12:45.688 --> 12:47.555
I have to show them
that I'm not afraid.

12:47.624 --> 12:50.148
The only thing you're gonna prove
by that is that you're stupid.

12:50.659 --> 12:52.392
It is intelligent to be afraid.

12:52.461 --> 12:55.304
I'm afraid, your father's
afraid, your family's afraid.

13:05.107 --> 13:06.164
Hi, Papa.

13:10.845 --> 13:11.875
What is this?

13:12.614 --> 13:13.920
I told them to come

13:13.945 --> 13:15.671
because you have to make peace now

13:16.351 --> 13:18.453
because like it or not,
we are a family.

13:20.489 --> 13:21.523
Ambush.

13:21.690 --> 13:23.122
Nico, no.

13:23.433 --> 13:26.343
We're all on the same team.
We have to work together here.

13:27.968 --> 13:29.566
Well, you're just going to
tell me what I need to do

13:29.590 --> 13:31.430
so why don't you get on
with it already, Bruno?

13:34.906 --> 13:36.039
Go back to work.

13:36.551 --> 13:37.640
Go live your life.

13:37.872 --> 13:39.592
Take your kids back
to their baseball games,

13:39.640 --> 13:42.062
your wife to a nice quiet
dinner just the two of you.

13:42.599 --> 13:43.964
Just keep your nose clean.

13:47.381 --> 13:48.398
And that's it?

13:48.899 --> 13:49.921
That's it.

13:51.285 --> 13:52.468
And if I say no?

13:54.622 --> 13:56.623
All right, now
you're gonna listen to me.

13:57.724 --> 13:59.724
When your father was here
I made him boss.

13:59.793 --> 14:00.882
He's gone now.

14:01.561 --> 14:03.382
I have to make myself boss again.

14:03.697 --> 14:06.203
And I write the commandments,
and you're gonna listen.

14:07.434 --> 14:08.693
I understand you, Nico,

14:08.718 --> 14:10.320
all princes want to be kings,

14:11.169 --> 14:13.101
but that's not the path
I'm gonna let you take.

14:14.507 --> 14:15.625
There is no one,

14:16.414 --> 14:19.226
who your father trusts more
with his affairs than Declan.

14:19.740 --> 14:21.843
There is no one he loves more than you.

14:22.531 --> 14:24.760
And that's all you're gonna
get and that's the situation.

14:24.784 --> 14:25.950
There is nothing else to say.

14:26.018 --> 14:28.546
I don't wanna hear one more word.

14:42.869 --> 14:44.201
Get a drink, OK?

14:44.862 --> 14:45.862
Good.

14:49.586 --> 14:50.789
You got what you wanted.

14:51.456 --> 14:52.507
No.

14:53.211 --> 14:54.648
I got what we all wanted.

14:55.571 --> 14:57.638
Most importantly,
it's what your father wanted.

14:59.397 --> 15:00.397
Come on.

15:05.957 --> 15:08.157
So, Nico Jr.
Finally got the message

15:08.226 --> 15:09.679
and he did the right thing.

15:10.028 --> 15:12.128
He went back to doing
real estate development.

15:12.460 --> 15:15.421
Was he bored?
Sure he was, but he was safe.

15:15.833 --> 15:17.187
All was good.

15:17.835 --> 15:20.554
For the next year,
everything ran so smoothly.

15:20.734 --> 15:23.734
Profits were up, no blood was spilled.

15:23.812 --> 15:26.132
They were quiet and fruitful times.

15:26.781 --> 15:29.718
City hall was happy,
our partners were happy

15:30.273 --> 15:32.848
and we all just tried to
keep on with our normal lives,

15:32.917 --> 15:35.539
until the day Vito
would finally be home.

16:10.687 --> 16:11.890
Hey, Michelle.

16:12.055 --> 16:13.454
I need to go out.

16:13.522 --> 16:14.721
I wasn't aware you couldn't.

16:14.790 --> 16:16.328
No, I need a night out!

16:16.546 --> 16:17.703
With the gang.

16:17.961 --> 16:19.445
You, the boys.

16:19.789 --> 16:21.429
Dancing, bottle service.

16:21.497 --> 16:22.964
I'm bored outta my mind.

16:23.032 --> 16:24.625
Hey, I'm swamped right now.

16:25.100 --> 16:27.100
My friends don't understand
what I'm going through.

16:27.870 --> 16:29.164
I hate being with them.

16:29.189 --> 16:31.257
Yeah, I've met your
friends, I can sympathize.

16:31.640 --> 16:33.990
Come on, Declan take me out.

16:34.015 --> 16:35.312
Dinner and drinks.

16:37.513 --> 16:38.945
I miss him so much.

16:39.812 --> 16:40.945
I miss my life.

16:41.632 --> 16:43.187
It'll be good for you too!

16:43.418 --> 16:44.884
I got another call, baby.

16:44.953 --> 16:47.078
So, if something clears up,
I'll be in touch, okay?

16:48.023 --> 16:49.671
Yeah?

16:50.925 --> 16:51.976
That's me.

16:54.377 --> 16:55.510
Hey!

17:00.835 --> 17:03.210
These boys have been terrorizing my son.

17:03.976 --> 17:05.789
They beat him up a few times,

17:08.964 --> 17:10.304
but not like this.

17:11.178 --> 17:14.240
The doctor says,
"One more punch to the head

17:14.265 --> 17:16.915
could cause permanent brain damage."

17:19.987 --> 17:22.647
My son begged me not to press charges,

17:23.906 --> 17:26.575
because he said it would
only make it worse for him.

17:28.838 --> 17:31.873
So, I went to see the
father of one of the boys.

17:32.938 --> 17:34.031
The leader.

17:35.936 --> 17:38.390
And he wasn't as understanding
as you wanted him to be?

17:39.305 --> 17:42.707
Monsters create monsters.

17:49.251 --> 17:51.752
Some years ago, when I first met you,

17:53.745 --> 17:55.476
you said you'll work for me.

17:58.452 --> 17:59.886
Is that still true?

18:02.847 --> 18:04.680
Can you help me?

18:10.242 --> 18:11.453
Open your mouth.

18:13.888 --> 18:17.046
You know that kid,
you beat the hell outta?

18:17.743 --> 18:19.351
That smart little Asian boy?

18:20.012 --> 18:22.779
If you ever touch him again,
you will disappear.

18:22.847 --> 18:25.062
If anyone ever touches him again,

18:25.460 --> 18:27.367
you will rush to his rescue.

18:27.786 --> 18:29.578
You are now his guardian angel.

18:30.296 --> 18:32.701
And because of you, from now on,

18:32.726 --> 18:35.398
his entire high school
existence will be charmed.

18:35.727 --> 18:39.515
Nod your head if you understand
and agree to these terms.

18:39.683 --> 18:41.317
Good.

19:04.116 --> 19:05.820
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:08.826 --> 19:09.826
How is Nico?

19:11.428 --> 19:12.914
He's walking the line.

19:13.363 --> 19:15.898
He's going to work every day,
go home for dinner.

19:16.133 --> 19:17.133
Good.

19:17.200 --> 19:19.265
- And business?
- Real good.

19:19.569 --> 19:21.632
We're up 8% across the board.

19:22.205 --> 19:25.100
We've increased
our legitimate holdings by 3%,

19:25.125 --> 19:27.421
not quite as much as I want,
but we're gettin' there.

19:27.777 --> 19:28.943
And the syndicate?

19:29.012 --> 19:30.478
Usual bullshit,

19:30.547 --> 19:32.804
but they're starting to get
back into the groove now.

19:33.700 --> 19:35.710
How's your protection?

19:36.419 --> 19:37.484
Tight.

19:37.720 --> 19:39.875
- No one looks at me, no one touches me.
- Good.

19:40.990 --> 19:41.990
How's Michelle?

19:43.078 --> 19:44.101
Bored.

19:44.260 --> 19:46.226
- She seeing anyone?
- Nah, not at all.

19:46.421 --> 19:47.726
You still got a tail on her?

19:48.230 --> 19:50.132
Around the clock.
She's loyal that one.

19:50.828 --> 19:51.966
She's a soldier.

19:52.035 --> 19:53.757
If she was a guy she'd have your job.

19:56.939 --> 19:59.429
Anyway, looks like you've got
everything under control.

19:59.804 --> 20:01.205
Yeah, it's really peaceful right now,

20:01.217 --> 20:02.554
Vito. Just the way you'd like it.

20:21.474 --> 20:23.218
My girlfriend's gonna take me home.

20:24.045 --> 20:25.218
Okay, sure.

20:25.875 --> 20:27.374
Did you have fun tonight?

20:27.736 --> 20:28.773
Yeah.

20:29.216 --> 20:30.749
No, you didn't.

20:32.156 --> 20:33.648
Thank you for this.

20:36.101 --> 20:37.117
I love you.

20:37.142 --> 20:38.460
- I love you too.
- Yeah.

20:40.075 --> 20:41.075
Bye.

21:08.559 --> 21:10.626
It's a good job, but it's a good thing

21:10.651 --> 21:12.312
your customers aren't very discerning.

21:12.440 --> 21:14.281
I'd never smoke this crap.

21:15.728 --> 21:16.757
Here you go.

21:19.493 --> 21:20.592
Move.

21:23.063 --> 21:24.429
Don't move!

21:24.498 --> 21:26.375
- Freeze!
- Drop the gun, now!

21:26.399 --> 21:28.366
You're under arrest!

21:39.381 --> 21:40.914
How you doing, Declan?

21:42.326 --> 21:43.382
All right.

21:44.217 --> 21:45.304
Who are you?

21:45.468 --> 21:46.484
I'm Renata.

21:48.764 --> 21:49.929
Vito's lawyer.

21:51.153 --> 21:52.382
And now I'm yours.

21:54.160 --> 21:58.234
They, offered me total
immunity for me to flip.

21:59.484 --> 22:01.409
I told them I didn't know
what they were talking about

22:01.433 --> 22:02.566
that they could kiss my ass.

22:03.896 --> 22:07.625
You do realize, you could get 15 years.

22:08.257 --> 22:09.265
So?

22:09.921 --> 22:12.375
They'll come back to you
with the same offer in a year.

22:13.479 --> 22:14.531
Two years.

22:15.339 --> 22:16.505
And five years.

22:18.528 --> 22:22.097
Enough time, for you to start to wonder

22:22.251 --> 22:23.917
what it is you're doing in there.

22:25.650 --> 22:28.554
While he's on the outside
eating steak and getting laid.

22:31.482 --> 22:32.656
I won't talk.

22:33.615 --> 22:34.664
Ever.

22:35.420 --> 22:37.219
That's what Vito said you'd say.

22:40.072 --> 22:41.179
Then he told me,

22:42.106 --> 22:43.806
and these are his words,

22:45.105 --> 22:48.006
I will not stop until he is out.

22:49.891 --> 22:53.593
I will work as if it were
my own son in prison.

23:14.944 --> 23:16.757
Vito was true to his promise.

23:17.450 --> 23:19.683
They had given me 15 years,
but he worked like hell,

23:19.708 --> 23:21.375
and got me out in four.

23:24.388 --> 23:28.124
From that day on, I was a
made man in the family.

23:33.016 --> 23:35.866
You do any job long enough
you can often predict

23:35.891 --> 23:38.062
the general ebb and flow
of your business.

23:38.304 --> 23:41.094
When you're a gangster, the
only thing you know for certain

23:41.163 --> 23:43.330
is that things never stay quiet

23:43.399 --> 23:44.632
as long as you'd like them to.

24:02.132 --> 24:04.517
Then one day, some Irish recruits

24:04.586 --> 24:08.031
massacred three Haitians
over a street corner beef.

24:08.210 --> 24:10.410
It was the kind of amateur brass balls

24:10.422 --> 24:12.343
swinging move that starts a war

24:12.396 --> 24:15.398
when all was needed was a phone
call to work it all out.

24:16.001 --> 24:17.421
Which one of you am I talking to?

24:27.232 --> 24:28.539
- You know who I am?
- Yeah.

24:30.171 --> 24:31.906
Who told you to hit the St. Henri crew?

24:33.256 --> 24:34.816
I don't know what you're talking about.

24:36.976 --> 24:38.312
I checked with Mick already.

24:38.853 --> 24:40.781
He said he doesn't know
shit about this mess.

24:41.455 --> 24:43.533
So, if you're working outside
of the lines for somebody

24:43.557 --> 24:46.277
I need to know about this and he's
gonna want to know about this too.

25:01.877 --> 25:02.877
Call 911.

25:04.377 --> 25:05.443
Somebody call 911.

25:23.453 --> 25:25.226
One bonehead move

25:25.471 --> 25:28.372
and everything we worked for
was about to fall apart.

25:28.828 --> 25:31.937
You killed an innocent civilian.

25:32.329 --> 25:34.701
Dad, husband...

25:34.726 --> 25:38.398
And he was from
a missionary family.

25:38.668 --> 25:41.796
So, I, I just want you to wrap
your heads around that karma.

25:43.038 --> 25:45.773
So along with the cops,

25:46.351 --> 25:48.756
I've got the church so far up my ass,

25:48.781 --> 25:50.522
all I've been smelling
is incense all day long!

25:50.546 --> 25:51.546
You!

25:52.348 --> 25:53.367
And you!

25:54.992 --> 25:56.984
You guys have any idea,

25:57.773 --> 26:01.750
any idea, how bad this is for business?

26:02.324 --> 26:04.372
Because now we're going to have to

26:04.384 --> 26:06.625
stop moving all products for weeks.

26:08.397 --> 26:09.796
- I wanna...
- Yes.

26:10.432 --> 26:11.468
Yeah?

26:11.800 --> 26:12.843
And yes.

26:13.301 --> 26:15.334
Okay, so then I'm really talking

26:15.404 --> 26:16.936
to the shitforbrains behind you!

26:17.005 --> 26:18.271
Now you know what,

26:18.339 --> 26:20.507
I'm not gonna talk to this
shitforbrains behind ya,

26:20.575 --> 26:22.007
that's your jobs!

26:22.577 --> 26:24.515
I'm not gonna clean up your mess.

26:25.054 --> 26:28.080
I cannot get you out of
this, I can't help you.

26:28.149 --> 26:29.359
City Hall...

26:30.328 --> 26:32.640
They're so hungry for blood

26:33.435 --> 26:35.687
that they're gonna get fed somehow.

26:37.628 --> 26:38.906
What are you doing?

26:41.611 --> 26:42.937
You call yourself a boss?

26:44.898 --> 26:46.465
You know what real bosses do?

26:46.534 --> 26:49.100
They take credit when credit is due,

26:49.521 --> 26:52.250
and they take the blame
when the shit hits the fan.

26:54.445 --> 26:55.674
Screw you, Declan.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.953
- You're out.
- What?

26:58.378 --> 27:00.211
You heard me. You're out.

27:00.280 --> 27:01.857
You hit first, you're
out of the syndicate.

27:01.881 --> 27:03.093
You can't do that!

27:03.917 --> 27:07.785
- Why?
- Because you didn't let me know

27:07.854 --> 27:10.343
before you let
the animals outta the cage.

27:10.437 --> 27:12.164
Declan, we should run
this by Vito first...

27:12.225 --> 27:15.093
I am Vito, right now!

27:20.729 --> 27:21.750
Declan...

27:22.513 --> 27:23.539
Declan...

27:25.572 --> 27:28.138
I'm just saying that
this is a big decision

27:28.660 --> 27:30.710
with farreaching implications.

27:40.719 --> 27:41.914
It's a big decision.

27:43.655 --> 27:44.773
Bruno right...

27:45.854 --> 27:46.992
Peacemaker.

27:47.616 --> 27:51.007
Okay, level heads will prevail.

27:55.872 --> 27:56.872
Hey, Mick...

28:00.739 --> 28:02.338
you say you're a boss?

28:03.141 --> 28:04.789
You show me what bosses do.

28:08.332 --> 28:09.364
Yeah.

28:15.834 --> 28:17.801
Boss, you can't be serious.

28:19.500 --> 28:21.086
- What, you're gonna listen...
- Can I get a hand here?

28:21.110 --> 28:22.250
What? No!

28:24.395 --> 28:26.094
Man he's made a mistake!

28:26.467 --> 28:30.007
Papa Lou, your guys
had every right to retaliate,

28:31.101 --> 28:33.007
but you killed an innocent civilian.

28:33.504 --> 28:36.148
And Inspector Aucoin,
he's gonna want an arrest.

28:36.541 --> 28:38.007
You're gonna give him one.

28:39.861 --> 28:41.117
You understand me?

28:43.086 --> 28:44.518
- Good.
- Good.

28:52.523 --> 28:54.812
Don't ever, unless it's family,

28:55.253 --> 28:57.015
do that again in front of anyone.

29:13.117 --> 29:17.765
What you want is a business
that's pretty much cash only.

29:18.581 --> 29:22.789
You know like a laundromat,
bar, parking lot.

29:23.286 --> 29:25.781
That way you can run as much
as you want through it.

29:28.531 --> 29:29.679
You pay taxes?

29:30.703 --> 29:33.757
If you wanna clean the money,
you gotta pay the taxes.

29:34.773 --> 29:37.148
- That sucks.
- Yeah, it does.

29:42.930 --> 29:44.640
Hey, watch that guy with the arm cast.

29:53.180 --> 29:54.703
You gotta be shittin' me.

29:55.282 --> 29:56.815
That cast is made of blow?

29:56.883 --> 29:58.450
One of the prison docs in on it.

29:58.620 --> 30:00.986
He gets a kilo a month
to distribute inside.

30:02.156 --> 30:04.756
Someone sets up a fight, needs a cast,

30:06.046 --> 30:07.913
Dr. Feelgood is happy to oblige.

30:10.163 --> 30:11.234
So...

30:11.741 --> 30:13.723
none of the guards notice that there's

30:13.748 --> 30:15.476
always someone in here with a cast?

30:16.870 --> 30:17.992
Guards get a cut.

30:18.762 --> 30:19.968
They pay taxes, right?

30:24.671 --> 30:26.140
Listen, do me a favor.

30:27.113 --> 30:29.945
I want you to find out about
the prison doctor for me.

30:31.781 --> 30:32.783
Yeah.

30:34.951 --> 30:36.117
Come on, Taco.

30:37.984 --> 30:38.889
Hey.

30:38.958 --> 30:41.083
Hey, Taco.

30:41.108 --> 30:42.898
You Italian stallion.

30:44.496 --> 30:45.820
How's work, Nico?

30:46.231 --> 30:47.264
Busy.

30:48.433 --> 30:49.433
What do you want?

30:51.062 --> 30:52.414
I need you to call your father.

30:53.605 --> 30:55.640
You need to call him
at the usual time that you do.

30:56.375 --> 30:58.734
After catching him up on, the family,

30:59.132 --> 31:00.310
you'll ask him how he feels.

31:00.379 --> 31:01.929
He's gonna say he feels fine.

31:02.514 --> 31:03.695
Then you're gonna say,

31:04.148 --> 31:05.796
"Dad, I hear you
got a bad cough."

31:06.109 --> 31:07.304
He's gonna say it's nothing.

31:07.954 --> 31:09.359
And then you'll insist

31:10.015 --> 31:12.234
that he goes to see the prison doctor

31:12.812 --> 31:14.623
given his past medical history.

31:14.693 --> 31:16.289
You're gonna play the concerned son.

31:17.445 --> 31:18.511
Is he all right?

31:19.164 --> 31:21.257
He's fine. He's fine.

31:21.289 --> 31:23.568
Vito's idea was crazy,

31:23.593 --> 31:25.992
but I was gonna do whatever
it took to get him out.

31:26.081 --> 31:27.081
Come on in.

31:27.843 --> 31:30.206
We put all our resources into it.

31:30.274 --> 31:32.599
We paid off doctors, we paid off

31:32.611 --> 31:35.460
nurses, Xray technicians, orderlies,

31:35.574 --> 31:38.508
blood labs, shit, we forged
our own medical records.

31:39.283 --> 31:41.234
And if they wouldn't take the money,

31:41.906 --> 31:43.343
well, we had other tactics.

31:43.734 --> 31:46.226
Okay, it says you have
a pain in your shoulder.

31:56.536 --> 31:57.554
What's this?

32:04.353 --> 32:06.078
Why do you have pictures of my family?

32:07.024 --> 32:08.591
You work at a prison, right?

32:09.979 --> 32:12.046
It cost us a notsosmall fortune,

32:12.115 --> 32:13.687
but a year and a half later,

32:13.712 --> 32:16.217
we bought ourselves
a terminal cancer diagnosis,

32:16.286 --> 32:17.703
and an early release.

32:18.454 --> 32:20.546
- To cancer!
- To cancer!

32:22.187 --> 32:24.391
Nico, seriously, you handled
the press like a pro!

32:24.460 --> 32:25.793
I mean, a grieving son

32:25.862 --> 32:27.874
trying to get his terminally
ill father out of prison.

32:27.898 --> 32:29.537
You're like an actor
guy, like a natural.

32:30.767 --> 32:32.745
Just glad it worked. Took
long enough, but it worked.

32:32.769 --> 32:34.820
Do you know how hard
it is to fake cancer?

32:34.917 --> 32:37.203
- How hard is it?
- Really hard!

32:38.240 --> 32:39.906
To my son, coming home.

32:40.643 --> 32:43.410
And me having the time to take
care of my tomatoes again.

32:43.479 --> 32:45.054
Salute, papa.

32:45.614 --> 32:48.348
Now can I go out again, or am
I confined to suburban hell?

32:48.417 --> 32:50.550
Let's wait until Vito comes home,

32:50.619 --> 32:52.085
he'll straighten everything out.

32:52.125 --> 32:55.021
And, then we'll rent an entire
floor at the Ritz Carlton.

32:55.046 --> 32:57.187
Or an entire floor at oncology!

32:59.085 --> 33:00.093
Who's drinking?

33:00.162 --> 33:01.273
Who's drinking?

33:01.326 --> 33:03.286
You know it's not a question,
it's not a question.

33:03.331 --> 33:05.023
I don't know how you did it.

33:05.811 --> 33:08.804
Seriously, just want you
to stay in the downlow.

33:09.170 --> 33:10.342
Okay? Until he gets home.

33:10.367 --> 33:12.148
I promised your dad
that I'd keep you safe.

33:13.308 --> 33:14.869
That line works
better with an audience.

33:15.643 --> 33:16.643
Save it for them.

33:18.279 --> 33:20.112
- Here we go!
- Look at that?

33:58.469 --> 34:00.906
We get Vito out,
so, things are great, right?

34:01.439 --> 34:03.546
You're not gonna believe
what happened next.

34:04.175 --> 34:06.808
Some journalists with nothing
better to do for a couple years,

34:06.877 --> 34:08.444
release a bombshell report

34:08.513 --> 34:11.130
saying the entire city's
construction industry

34:11.156 --> 34:13.960
was totally corrupt
and controlled by the mob.

34:14.417 --> 34:15.585
Which it was.

34:15.906 --> 34:18.514
Construction was one of our
biggest money makers, after all,

34:18.539 --> 34:19.958
We couldn't afford to lose that.

34:19.984 --> 34:20.984
Bastardi.

34:21.953 --> 34:23.812
City Hall went into a crisis mode.

34:24.039 --> 34:25.871
They tapped Quebec
superior court justice

34:25.940 --> 34:28.806
France Charbonneau to head up
a commission to investigate.

34:28.876 --> 34:31.143
We all know what the standard playbook

34:31.212 --> 34:33.406
for political scandal looks like.

34:33.835 --> 34:35.701
First, they'll issue
a statement telling us

34:35.726 --> 34:38.250
that they take these
allegations very seriously.

34:38.319 --> 34:41.187
And then they'll hire
a taskforce or a commission.

34:41.453 --> 34:43.632
But nothing ever comes from it.

34:44.023 --> 34:47.467
Because those groups always
come from within the system.

34:48.484 --> 34:50.539
This will not happen with me!

34:50.563 --> 34:51.610
Shit!

34:51.998 --> 34:55.068
The inquiry is mandated
to probe longstanding allegations

34:55.092 --> 34:57.000
that firms have been colluding to win

34:57.024 --> 34:59.188
big roadwork and
construction contracts,

34:59.359 --> 35:01.276
and that some provincial and municipal

35:01.288 --> 35:03.116
politicians have been on the take.

35:03.141 --> 35:04.810
Let me make something very clear,

35:04.835 --> 35:06.009
I choose my own team.

35:06.034 --> 35:08.078
There will be no
parameters placed on me.

35:08.146 --> 35:11.584
In short, I will be no one's
friend in this investigation.

35:11.609 --> 35:14.397
The commission
will delve into the last 15 years

35:14.422 --> 35:16.367
of construction contracts in Quebec,

35:16.392 --> 35:19.750
looking for any pattern
of collusion and corruption

35:19.872 --> 35:22.085
in the way
those contracts were awarded.

35:22.110 --> 35:25.382
And that organized crime
has its hand in all of it!

35:26.970 --> 35:30.872
If we find this to be true,
it will stand no more.

35:31.332 --> 35:32.365
Shit!

35:43.042 --> 35:44.615
Sorry to hear about your cancer.

35:49.410 --> 35:51.382
You still owe me
from the last game, though.

35:52.032 --> 35:53.233
Double or nothin'?

35:54.874 --> 35:57.040
You would take money from a dying man?

35:57.065 --> 35:58.132
Hell, yeah!

37:42.570 --> 37:45.397
You're such an idiot! Bid a
dollar, a dollar! Idiot!

37:51.821 --> 37:53.530
Hello.

38:05.908 --> 38:06.991
Are you sure?

39:04.578 --> 39:05.927
It's gotta be the 'Ndrangheta.

39:05.951 --> 39:07.380
I don't know, I don't know,

39:07.405 --> 39:09.327
that's a really big move for Toto.

39:09.488 --> 39:11.933
That's what we said when we, when
he had the Irish at the Haitians...

39:11.957 --> 39:13.491
Not the same thing, Bruno.

39:14.158 --> 39:16.280
You think he made some kind of alliance?
He'd have to.

39:17.077 --> 39:18.210
I heard a name.

39:19.171 --> 39:20.264
Sal Montagna.

39:20.431 --> 39:22.108
Holy shit! The Bonannos?

39:22.534 --> 39:23.741
Sal Montagna?

39:24.168 --> 39:25.960
- Who'd you hear that from?
- I heard it.

39:26.304 --> 39:28.184
Do you think he'd make
a move up here like that?

39:28.473 --> 39:30.341
Make a move, on Vito from New York?

39:30.366 --> 39:31.921
- That's crazy.
- Sal is crazy.

39:32.257 --> 39:36.311
Crazy enough, to, to make a move
on a boss and whack his son?

39:37.048 --> 39:38.048
I don't know.

39:38.493 --> 39:39.592
Bru?

39:41.225 --> 39:42.249
I don't know.

39:42.620 --> 39:45.007
It's no secret they want
our action for themselves.

39:45.188 --> 39:46.569
If they controlled our ports,

39:46.594 --> 39:49.023
they'd make 10 times what
they make now on drugs.

39:52.100 --> 39:53.866
- Does Vito know yet?
- No.

39:54.436 --> 39:56.921
I called. They're gonna
tell him in the morning.

40:04.686 --> 40:06.530
So, my boy told me a new joke!

40:06.895 --> 40:07.960
Knockknock!

40:09.164 --> 40:10.936
- Who's there?
- Interrupting cow.

40:11.681 --> 40:13.281
- Interrupt...
- Moo!

40:15.905 --> 40:17.389
- What, you get it?
- Yeah. I get it.

40:18.530 --> 40:20.952
Mr. Rizzuto,
you need to come with us.

40:22.491 --> 40:24.525
At the Montreal General Hospital,

40:24.594 --> 40:28.085
doctors pronounced Nic Rizzuto Jr.
Dead on arrival.

40:28.290 --> 40:32.013
Experts say the brazen murder means
there's a major power struggle

40:32.038 --> 40:33.733
in Montreal's underworld.

40:35.604 --> 40:37.971
Mister Rizzuto, did you hear me?

40:38.375 --> 40:39.702
Mister Rizzuto?

40:44.493 --> 40:45.662
My son is dead?

40:46.615 --> 40:47.639
Yes.

40:48.255 --> 40:49.624
My deepest condolences.

40:51.485 --> 40:52.639
When's the funeral?

40:53.943 --> 40:55.009
In three days.

40:57.013 --> 40:58.764
So, what do I have to do to leave?

41:00.316 --> 41:01.706
There is a procedure for that, but a

41:01.718 --> 41:03.237
lot of people have to sign off on it.

41:06.001 --> 41:07.434
Well, get 'em on the phone.

41:08.662 --> 41:10.595
It doesn't work that way.

41:12.752 --> 41:14.030
Make it work.

41:15.076 --> 41:16.609
Look, anticipating that you'd ask,

41:16.677 --> 41:18.475
I actually looked into it already.

41:19.509 --> 41:20.686
It's not gonna happen.

41:24.892 --> 41:27.147
You're not going to let me bury my son?

41:29.608 --> 41:30.796
It's out of my control.

41:31.742 --> 41:33.975
Again, my condolences.

41:35.069 --> 41:37.109
Is there anything I can do
for you, in the meantime?

41:37.464 --> 41:39.442
You can have more phone time
if you'd like, as much you...

41:39.466 --> 41:42.100
You can shut your mouth,
you useless piece of shit.

Next time on Bad Blood...

43:20.260 --> 43:23.819
So, his plane lands
at three, right, Gio?

43:26.577 --> 43:28.608
- What's going on?
- Vito doesn't want you there.

43:31.470 --> 43:32.553
Sal's here.

43:32.602 --> 43:34.402
- Well, who's Sal?
- Sal Montagna

43:34.514 --> 43:36.250
acting head of the Bonanno family.

43:38.744 --> 43:42.788
I think the time for diplomacy is over.
