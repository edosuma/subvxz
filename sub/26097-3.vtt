00:14.056 --> 00:15.474
-Hey.
-Hey.

00:15.557 --> 00:18.685
-What are you doing here?
-Just out for a morning run.

00:19.770 --> 00:23.482
Yeah? Nice athletic gear.
What are those, Nike jeans?

00:23.565 --> 00:26.652
-Moisture-wicking denim?
-Well, you leave me no option.

00:26.735 --> 00:29.112
I never get to see you.
I just sit around.

00:29.196 --> 00:32.115
Last night I watched <i>Wheel of Fortune</i>
with my grandma.

00:32.449 --> 00:34.576
So you came out here to slow me down?

00:34.868 --> 00:36.078
This is slow?

00:36.161 --> 00:39.331
I'd be a lot faster
if I was wearing different... lungs.

00:39.456 --> 00:41.458
[exhales forcefully]

00:44.294 --> 00:46.129
-[Casey chuckles]
-That's much better.

00:46.630 --> 00:50.384
Okay. How about... [pants]
more of this, except...

00:50.467 --> 00:52.970
lying down, and me with less clothes on?

00:53.053 --> 00:58.100
[chuckles] Um, yeah, about that...
I was... I was wondering, like...

00:58.517 --> 01:01.645
do you feel like we maybe,
like, rushed into it the first time?

01:01.728 --> 01:05.774
Like, I was wondering if we could
just kind of, like, take it slow?

01:07.025 --> 01:09.361
-What's happening with you?
-What? Nothing. I'm...

01:09.695 --> 01:12.489
-What are you talking about?
-You can't even look at me.

01:12.573 --> 01:15.909
You're awkward.
[chuckles] You're so awkward.

01:15.993 --> 01:18.495
No, that's just how I am. Shut up.

01:18.579 --> 01:20.998
Look... I get it.

01:22.124 --> 01:25.210
And we can wait as long as you want for...

01:25.627 --> 01:26.503
your second...

01:27.045 --> 01:28.005
first time.

01:28.839 --> 01:31.091
-Okay?
-Thanks.

01:31.675 --> 01:33.802
Um... Do You want to watch a movie
tomorrow night?

01:34.136 --> 01:35.095
[whispering] Yes!

01:37.389 --> 01:38.390
What?

01:38.932 --> 01:41.268
Oh, damn it, I thought we were done.

-[chuckles] California rolls.

03:32.921 --> 03:33.755
Hi.

03:33.839 --> 03:34.965
-Hi.
-Sorry, I'm late.

03:35.465 --> 03:38.677
I'm not actually late.
I'm on time, but I'm usually really early,

03:38.760 --> 03:41.012
-so for me, this is late.
-Oh, no problem.

03:41.513 --> 03:43.098
Was that a brag or an apology?

03:44.057 --> 03:45.475
Oh, hey. No, sit.

03:45.559 --> 03:48.603
We were chatting about nothing.
What were we even chatting about?

03:48.854 --> 03:52.399
-Oh, sushi.
-Yes, raw fish. It's delicious, but risky.

03:52.733 --> 03:53.984
[chuckles]

03:54.109 --> 03:57.112
Um, so, Ms. Whitaker,
thank you so much for meeting with us.

03:57.195 --> 04:01.283
We just wanted to check in
because Casey is no longer at Newton

04:01.366 --> 04:02.451
and I...

04:03.201 --> 04:04.035
We've...

04:04.369 --> 04:07.247
just been going through some changes
at home...

04:07.330 --> 04:10.959
She had an affair and Dad kicked her
out of the house and now she has a cat.

04:11.084 --> 04:12.961
Ugh, cat! [scribbling]

04:13.044 --> 04:15.088
Sam, that's private, bud.

04:17.632 --> 04:19.009
[Ms. Whitaker clicks her tongue]

04:19.342 --> 04:23.430
Well, let's refocus. We want to help Sam
in any way that we can,

04:23.513 --> 04:27.434
and speaking of, I noticed
that he hasn't applied to any colleges.

04:27.517 --> 04:28.894
We have that all planned out.

04:28.977 --> 04:32.689
So after graduation,
Sam's gonna continue to live at home,

04:32.773 --> 04:36.109
and take one or two courses
at a community college

04:36.193 --> 04:38.361
and continue working at Techtropolis.

04:39.029 --> 04:40.280
Is that what you want?

04:41.031 --> 04:44.701
Because you don't have to do that.
You can go away to college, Sam.

04:45.410 --> 04:46.953
I'm fine with staying home.

04:47.829 --> 04:50.415
Well, Sam,
if you're still figuring it out,

04:50.499 --> 04:54.002
I facilitate a district-wide peer group
for students on the spectrum,

04:54.085 --> 04:57.756
focused on handling transitions,
specifically, around graduation.

04:58.089 --> 04:59.090
-Really?
-Oh.

04:59.216 --> 05:00.550
That group sounds cool.

05:00.634 --> 05:02.928
Oh, it's very cool. It's very cool,

05:03.011 --> 05:04.930
and it prepares students for adulthood

05:05.013 --> 05:07.766
and kind of supports the transition
to independent living

05:07.849 --> 05:09.684
to prepare for what I like to call...

05:09.893 --> 05:12.395
[deep voice] The Abyss. [chuckles]

05:12.646 --> 05:16.316
I know that sounded pretty scary,
and I should stop saying it like that.

05:16.608 --> 05:20.445
-I'm not sure if I want to do that.
-Actually, I don't think we need a group.

05:20.737 --> 05:23.573
I made an appointment for Sam
with Dr. Brob.

05:23.657 --> 05:25.492
Oh, I follow her on Instagram.

05:25.575 --> 05:26.952
She is fun. [laughs]

05:27.452 --> 05:30.539
The group sounds interesting.
And we'll think about college.

05:31.665 --> 05:32.707
Doug?

05:34.125 --> 05:36.920
We agreed about the college plan,
like, over a year ago.

05:37.003 --> 05:38.547
Things change. Right, Elsa?

05:38.630 --> 05:40.799
I mean,
you of all people should know that.

05:40.966 --> 05:42.968
[Sam scribbles]

05:44.219 --> 05:45.345
[Elsa sighs]

05:45.428 --> 05:46.263
[silence]

05:46.346 --> 05:48.056
Well, that's the bell.

05:52.561 --> 05:53.979
[school bell ringing]

05:54.062 --> 05:55.272
There it was.

05:55.897 --> 05:58.441
You know, I jumped the gun. [chuckles]

05:59.067 --> 06:01.069
[students chattering]

06:04.823 --> 06:06.408
That was nice, huh?

06:06.533 --> 06:10.287
-It smelled like radiator in there.
-[Doug] You know something, it did.

06:10.370 --> 06:11.371
[Elsa chuckles nervously]

06:11.454 --> 06:14.708
Alright. Well, I'll see you later.
Have a good day. Okay?

06:19.880 --> 06:22.591
Sam, honey, I know we haven't talked much

06:22.674 --> 06:25.427
since you found out about what happened
between me and your dad.

06:25.510 --> 06:26.636
And I totally get it.

06:26.720 --> 06:30.807
But if you ever want to ask me anything,
I'm here.

06:31.850 --> 06:32.726
Nope.

06:36.521 --> 06:39.024
[Sam] <i>I think everyone sometimes gets</i>
<i>the urge to run...</i>

06:45.155 --> 06:48.199

Hey, this isn't a sprint.
Knock it off, ladies!

[Casey] Oh, my God, are you okay?

07:09.346 --> 07:10.305
You pushed me.

07:11.473 --> 07:12.474
No.

07:12.557 --> 07:14.476
[pants]

07:14.601 --> 07:15.560
I didn't.

07:17.354 --> 07:20.982
[Sam] The worst elopement story
I ever heard was the one that the hostess

07:21.066 --> 07:23.818
at a Mongolian BBQ told my mom
when I was little.

07:24.361 --> 07:25.654
The lion story.

07:26.237 --> 07:28.949
[Sam]<i> It's about a boy with autism</i>
<i>who went on a safari</i>

<i>-with his parents in Africa.</i>
-[elephant trumpeting]

07:31.326 --> 07:35.038
[Sam] <i>He was frightened by all the sounds</i>

<i>He could feel the predators everywhere.</i>

<i>It became too much for him,</i>
<i>so he ran off into the night.</i>

07:43.546 --> 07:45.006

07:45.757 --> 07:47.884
<i>he was eaten by a ferocious lion.</i>

07:48.760 --> 07:50.762
-Okay, everyone.
-[students chattering]

07:52.055 --> 07:53.348
Settle.

07:53.431 --> 07:55.558
It's time for a group assignment.

07:55.642 --> 07:58.478
You should all form groups of four.

07:58.603 --> 08:00.438
[students making noise]

08:02.482 --> 08:03.984
Quietly.

08:19.040 --> 08:20.750
<i>There are only four, actually.</i>

[teacher, muffled]
Sam, you need to get into a group.

08:23.128 --> 08:26.464
[Sam] <i>So, the chances of being eaten</i>
<i>by one are quite small.</i>

Sam, please, take off your headphones.

[blows cigarette smoke]

09:30.653 --> 09:33.031
"You win." That's what he said.

09:33.114 --> 09:36.367
Who proposes like that?
It's, like, the least romantic thing ever.

09:36.451 --> 09:37.994
Yeah. It's not great.

09:38.078 --> 09:39.162
[man] This is BS.

09:39.996 --> 09:41.956
Of course
your friend's gonna take your side.

09:42.040 --> 09:46.044
Look, and FYI, you did win.
That ring cost me a lot of money.

09:46.127 --> 09:49.047
Okay. This isn't about...
winners and losers.

09:49.130 --> 09:50.924
It's about how you move forward.

09:51.966 --> 09:56.262
I'm still not entirely clear why I'm here,
and I'm actually sort of uncomfortable.

09:56.346 --> 09:58.181
So if we could just
get through this quick.

09:58.264 --> 10:01.017
Step one would be giving an answer
to my proposal.

10:01.101 --> 10:04.395
I did give you an answer.
I said, "Give me more time."

10:04.479 --> 10:09.025
Maybe you're in denial that I asked you,
just like you're in denial about the baby.

10:09.109 --> 10:12.612
What? No! I completely accept this...

10:12.695 --> 10:13.530
[inhales]

10:14.197 --> 10:15.990
...weird thing
I don't want to talk about ever.

10:16.699 --> 10:18.243
OMG, Julia.

10:18.326 --> 10:21.037
Stop talking like that.
You went to Harvard.

10:21.121 --> 10:22.330
You are a surgeon.

10:22.413 --> 10:23.790
He does have a point, Jules.

10:24.541 --> 10:27.335
I mean, you're holding your pants together
with a rubber band

10:27.418 --> 10:29.045
because you won't buy maternity clothes.

10:29.129 --> 10:32.090
Oh, she also hasn't told her parents
she's pregnant.

10:32.173 --> 10:33.800
[imitates mockingly]

10:33.925 --> 10:35.218
My mom will freak out.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.555
She has a weak heart.
I don't want to kill her.

10:40.348 --> 10:43.226
I won't have this on my team.
I just won't, do you understand me?

10:45.103 --> 10:48.189
You don't have to love each other,
but you have to love each other.

10:49.399 --> 10:51.317
Casey, you'll ice Izzie's wrist

10:51.401 --> 10:54.404
and you'll both stay in here
until you can get along.

10:59.075 --> 11:00.952
Actually, I think we worked it out.

11:01.536 --> 11:03.037
You know what? No, you didn't.

11:03.496 --> 11:04.706
[door closes]

11:11.045 --> 11:12.297
I can do it myself.

11:18.094 --> 11:20.680
I need to make a phone call,
but someone pushed me,

11:21.014 --> 11:23.099
-so now I can't use my wrist.
-I didn't push you.

11:23.183 --> 11:25.101
-I was nowhere near you.
-Whatever.

11:26.060 --> 11:28.605
Can you just hand me my phone
out of my backpack, please?

11:30.190 --> 11:31.983
Fine, but I didn't push you.

11:33.484 --> 11:36.905
I'm so sick of this stupid school
and this stupid track team.

11:43.286 --> 11:44.370
Hey, it's Izzie.

11:45.246 --> 11:47.832
I need you to watch the baby
for an extra couple of hours.

11:48.708 --> 11:51.002
Okay. Great. Bye.

11:52.420 --> 11:53.463
Baby?

11:55.215 --> 11:57.967
-Do you have a kid?
-Of course not, I'm not a moron.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.094
-My mother is.
-Hey, mine too.

12:00.178 --> 12:03.389
Not that it's any of your business,
but I take care of my three siblings.

12:04.807 --> 12:06.351
-You do?
-Yeah.

12:07.352 --> 12:10.313
-So, you're not a bazillionaire?
-Not yet.

12:13.233 --> 12:16.486
My brother has autism, so I'm, like...

12:17.070 --> 12:18.696
constantly looking out for him.

12:19.280 --> 12:20.323
I didn't know that.

12:21.241 --> 12:24.244
Dude, how would you know that?
You, like, barely talk to me.

12:24.535 --> 12:27.747
[laughs]
I talk to you. I just say mean things.

12:27.830 --> 12:29.457
[both laughing]

12:33.378 --> 12:36.339
You know, you are not what I expected.

12:37.423 --> 12:39.175
Well, I'm not like the other girls.

12:40.051 --> 12:41.177
I don't get to mess up.

12:41.636 --> 12:44.055
[laughs] Last year Penelope drove her car

12:44.138 --> 12:45.765
into a tree and guess
what happened to her?

12:46.641 --> 12:48.434
Her parents bought her a new car.

12:49.269 --> 12:52.689
And Quinn has vodka in her locker
just in case she gets bored.

12:52.772 --> 12:54.148
-Really?
-Yep. [chuckles]

12:54.232 --> 12:56.985
And, I think, a bikini, for some reason.

12:57.068 --> 12:59.070
[both chuckle]

13:00.154 --> 13:01.114
But for me...

13:02.573 --> 13:04.284
this school, what I do here, it matters.

13:06.953 --> 13:11.499
I feel like I have to be perfect,
all the time, and it's exhausting.

13:14.252 --> 13:15.837
Is that why you were such a dick to me?

13:17.672 --> 13:18.548
Probably.

13:20.758 --> 13:21.884
Or I might just be a dick.

13:21.968 --> 13:23.970
[both chuckle]

13:27.432 --> 13:29.517
-[mobile ringtone]
-Hello?

13:29.600 --> 13:32.854
Hey, the school just called.
Sam's eloped.

13:32.937 --> 13:34.605
I know, I'm here. He texted me.

13:35.064 --> 13:36.691
Oh, he texted you? Good.

13:36.774 --> 13:38.985
I'm picking him up now.
I got to go, okay?

13:39.068 --> 13:41.070
Okay, great. I’ll meet you at home.

13:41.154 --> 13:42.155
No. There's no need.

13:44.157 --> 13:45.241
Um, okay.

13:45.950 --> 13:50.788
Um, well, just, you know,
call me if you need me and...

13:50.872 --> 13:54.292
don't forget we have Dr. Brob at 4:00.

13:54.709 --> 13:55.960
<i>-Okay. Bye.</i>
-[hangs up phone]

14:05.178 --> 14:06.512
[sighs]

14:06.596 --> 14:07.847
I love grilled cheese.

14:09.432 --> 14:12.435
Hey, what do you like more, Sam,
grilled cheese or pizza?

14:12.560 --> 14:15.772
Grilled cheese. It's firmer,
so it's easier to eat with one hand.

14:15.855 --> 14:17.732
That's true. That is very true.

14:20.526 --> 14:21.861
So, are you okay?

14:23.029 --> 14:24.989
That must've been scary,
getting hit by a car.

14:26.532 --> 14:27.700
It was fine.

14:28.034 --> 14:30.912
Beth was barely driving.
She's not a real driver yet.

14:32.747 --> 14:34.248
And you ran out of class?

14:35.083 --> 14:36.250
It was too loud.

14:38.544 --> 14:40.588
Want to talk
about how you're feeling, Sam?

14:40.671 --> 14:41.547
No, I don't.

14:43.716 --> 14:44.926
Yeah, I understand.

14:46.135 --> 14:48.388
I don't like to talk
about my feelings either.

14:48.513 --> 14:50.848
-[spatula clatters]
-It's hard.

14:54.852 --> 15:00.108
So, I looked up the peer group that
the guidance counselor was talking about.

15:00.191 --> 15:01.943
They're meeting later
if you want to try that.

15:03.611 --> 15:07.115
Why would I want to talk about my problems
with a bunch of random people

15:07.198 --> 15:09.325
that just want to talk
about their stupid problems?

15:10.952 --> 15:12.870
Well, they're not random people.

15:12.954 --> 15:14.831
[Sam scribbling]

15:14.956 --> 15:18.918
Sam, they're kids like you with autism
that are graduating soon.

15:21.754 --> 15:23.339
You burnt my grilled cheese.

15:25.007 --> 15:26.008
Yeah, I know.

15:31.556 --> 15:34.684
I read about this guy in Vermont.
I think it was Vermont.

15:35.059 --> 15:37.562
And he runs a hundred miles at a time.

15:37.645 --> 15:39.063
Like, he will literally walk

15:39.147 --> 15:41.441
out of his house
and go on a hundred-mile run.

15:41.524 --> 15:43.609
[Izzie] Dude, get a job. [chuckles]

15:44.235 --> 15:47.864
Actually, when I read it, I thought
it was great. That kind of freedom?

15:49.282 --> 15:51.659
But now... I don't know.

15:52.910 --> 15:54.370
-What do you mean?
-I mean...

15:55.455 --> 15:58.624
Like, I think it was dumb to think
that I could ever leave here.

15:59.750 --> 16:01.210
Sam and my dad, they...

16:02.003 --> 16:03.045
they need me.

16:05.423 --> 16:09.552
I used to want to get as far away
from this place as possible, but now...

16:11.220 --> 16:13.139
I'm not really sure that I ever will.

16:17.059 --> 16:18.644
Screw that. I'll be right back.

16:42.752 --> 16:45.588
[door closes] I'm tired of trying
to be perfect all the time.

16:46.255 --> 16:48.925
How about, for once,
we stop caring about everyone else?

16:50.426 --> 16:51.928
I raided Quinn's locker.

16:52.303 --> 16:54.305
[both laughing]

17:04.440 --> 17:05.274
You got this.

17:09.612 --> 17:12.823
[mobile ringtone]

17:33.553 --> 17:35.304
I'm sure they're gonna be here
in a minute.

17:36.931 --> 17:38.391
You have very pretty hair.

17:39.016 --> 17:40.601
It's very nice and shiny.

17:44.188 --> 17:47.275
So, Lily, you said you had something
you wanted to talk about.

17:47.358 --> 17:50.820
Yeah, I always go to the same dentist,
Dr. Ruth Swan.

17:50.903 --> 17:53.656
But last time my mom said
I couldn't go to her anymore.

17:53.739 --> 17:54.574
Why not?

17:55.449 --> 17:56.617
Because she retired.

17:58.911 --> 18:00.621
Well, so what are you going to do?

18:01.330 --> 18:03.249
-I'll let all my teeth fall out.
-[chuckles]

18:03.332 --> 18:06.419
-That's pretty dumb.
-Sam, we try not to judge in this group.

18:07.253 --> 18:09.171
Yeah, Sam. We don't judge in here.

18:09.255 --> 18:10.131
Okay, Amber.

18:10.214 --> 18:12.300
Try not to judge Sam judging.

18:12.383 --> 18:15.511
I know it's dumb,
but I can't see a different person.

18:15.595 --> 18:17.096
I just-- I just can't.

18:17.722 --> 18:21.350
Well, if you wait long enough,
I can do it.

18:21.684 --> 18:23.603
-I want to be a dentist.
-Oh!

18:24.895 --> 18:28.065
Change can be very difficult.
For everyone.

18:28.149 --> 18:31.193
Does anyone in here find it difficult
to deal with change?

18:37.366 --> 18:39.910
She hasn't always been terrible.

18:39.994 --> 18:43.581
I mean, when I was younger
she was really together and fun.

18:44.540 --> 18:49.670
Then my dad left and she had an injury
at work and started taking painkillers...

18:50.129 --> 18:51.922
and just spiraled from there.

18:52.465 --> 18:53.341
Sucks.

18:53.424 --> 18:55.551
It's like my life's goal
to be nothing like her.

18:55.635 --> 18:58.054
Oh, my God, dude, me too.

18:58.137 --> 19:00.139
-Cheers.
-Yeah. [chuckles]

19:02.099 --> 19:04.101
-[Casey grunts]
-Mm-hmm.

19:04.769 --> 19:07.938
To be honest, I think half the reason
why I spend so much time with Nate

19:08.022 --> 19:10.858
is because... I don't want to go home.

19:10.941 --> 19:13.986
Not because he's your boyfriend
and you love him very much?

19:14.945 --> 19:16.822
No, Nate's awesome. But...

19:17.114 --> 19:19.617
sometimes it just feels
not quite right with him.

19:20.493 --> 19:22.161
Like he's from a different planet

19:22.244 --> 19:24.413
and won't ever know
what it's like on my planet.

19:24.497 --> 19:25.748
[laughs]

19:25.831 --> 19:30.878
-You ever feel that way with Evan?
-No. No, not really. [chuckles]

19:30.961 --> 19:32.963
Lucky ho. Jeez.

19:33.047 --> 19:34.507
[both laughing]

19:37.927 --> 19:38.928
Your first time?

19:39.387 --> 19:40.304
Yeah.

19:42.181 --> 19:45.184
My daughter and I have been coming here
for about six months.

19:45.267 --> 19:46.811
Ms. Whitaker is wonderful.

19:46.894 --> 19:49.730
Yeah, she's great.
She's scared of sushi, though.

19:52.108 --> 19:53.025
Didn't know that.

19:53.109 --> 19:55.486
Maybe it's 'cause I know her
a little bit better than you do.

19:56.862 --> 19:58.656
Teacher's pet. [chuckles]

20:00.241 --> 20:01.575
Hey, you hungry?

20:01.826 --> 20:04.704
I find unnecessary eating
makes the wait go faster.

20:05.663 --> 20:07.331
-I have cheddar chips.
-I love these.

20:08.624 --> 20:09.750
Thank you.

20:10.459 --> 20:12.461
So... what do you do?

20:13.129 --> 20:14.088
I'm an EMT.

20:14.839 --> 20:17.299
-Really?
-Yeah. I save people's lives.

20:17.925 --> 20:19.051
-[laughs]
-No big deal.

20:20.261 --> 20:24.140
Well, my daughter is obsessed
with ambulances.

20:24.557 --> 20:28.185
In fact, you should probably try
and leave before she gets out here,

20:28.269 --> 20:30.938
or you'll be stuck answering,
like, 10,000 questions.

20:31.021 --> 20:32.314
No, I'm used to it.

20:32.648 --> 20:34.900
She should come
for a ride-along sometime.

20:36.152 --> 20:38.779
Oh, my God, that would be great.

20:39.029 --> 20:41.699
-You would be my daughter's hero.
-Anytime.

20:41.782 --> 20:44.118
Well, let me give you my phone number.

20:47.163 --> 20:48.080
Okay.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.501
-I'm ready.
-Okay. It's Megan.

20:53.127 --> 20:54.295
And I'm Doug.

20:54.378 --> 20:56.589
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

20:56.672 --> 21:00.843
Okay, anyone else want to share
about changes they're dealing with?

21:02.178 --> 21:03.179
I do.

21:07.016 --> 21:10.269
The changes that I'm dealing with
are that my mom left home,

21:10.352 --> 21:13.022
and my sister doesn't go
to my school anymore.

21:13.105 --> 21:16.609
And my therapist won't see me,
and my ex-girlfriend wanted to have

21:16.692 --> 21:18.944
a casual relationship,
and then no relationship.

21:19.862 --> 21:21.197
And, well...

21:21.781 --> 21:25.284
the reason prey animals hang around
in a pack is for safety.

21:25.951 --> 21:27.161
So they don't get eaten.

21:27.745 --> 21:30.998
And I was feeling
like a prey animal with no pack.

21:31.540 --> 21:34.710
And on top of all of that,
I'm graduating into The Abyss.

21:34.794 --> 21:37.755
And that's... scary.

21:39.840 --> 21:42.927
-That's all.
-Yeah, forget what I said about The Abyss.

21:43.010 --> 21:46.430
-I was just being dramatic.
-I liked it. It's an accurate description.

21:46.514 --> 21:47.723
Well, okay.

21:47.807 --> 21:50.976
Anyways, all of your feelings, Sam,
they make a lot of sense.

21:51.602 --> 21:54.647
[huffs]
I didn't think it made sense at all.

21:55.397 --> 21:57.525
More sense
than letting all your teeth fall out.

21:57.608 --> 21:59.735
-[all chuckle]
-True.

22:00.236 --> 22:03.280
Okay, so change is inevitable, right?
But how do we deal with it?

22:06.158 --> 22:08.828
One way is we can ask for help
when we need something.

22:08.911 --> 22:13.415
For example, colleges are required to make
accommodations for students with autism,

22:13.499 --> 22:15.876
but you have to self-identify.

22:16.252 --> 22:19.338
In fact, okay, let's make this
our assignment for the week.

22:19.421 --> 22:23.384
Ask for something you need.
One thing, even if it's tiny. Okay?

22:27.555 --> 22:28.430
Great.

22:35.271 --> 22:37.356
-Paige.
-Oh, hey, Sam.

22:37.439 --> 22:39.942
Oh, my gosh.
I just got out of a yearbook meeting.

22:40.025 --> 22:41.652
No one could decide on a font.

22:41.735 --> 22:46.782
And I'm sorry, but Helvetica...
gross, we are way better than that.

22:46.866 --> 22:49.076
I need to ask you
for help with something.

22:49.159 --> 22:50.452
Okay, shoot.

22:50.536 --> 22:53.497
Well, I know we're not boyfriend
and girlfriend,

22:53.581 --> 22:56.250
or even in a casual relationship anymore.

22:56.333 --> 23:00.421
But I was wondering if sometimes we could
walk down the hall together still,

23:00.504 --> 23:04.758
specifically between 3rd and 4th period,
when traffic flow is particularly high?

23:07.428 --> 23:08.762
I would be honored.

23:09.847 --> 23:13.392
-Good.
-Okay. So I have history 2nd period,

23:13.475 --> 23:16.145
so we'll meet outside Mr. Bowers' class,
unless I text you

23:16.228 --> 23:20.649
because sometimes I stay a little bit late
to talk about wars with other Warheads.

23:25.070 --> 23:28.115
That's exactly what happens
when you drop into Tilted Towers.

23:28.198 --> 23:31.243
I told you to go--
I told everybody to land at Dusty Depot.

23:31.327 --> 23:35.122
Well, what are you-- Casey, hey!
What are-- You're here.

23:36.999 --> 23:41.253
Beth let me in. She was...
She was baking a cake 'cause she hit...

23:41.503 --> 23:45.591
[sniffs] ...Sam with the car, so I grabbed
a little handful of it and...

23:46.258 --> 23:48.761
here we are. [chuckles and sniffs]

23:48.886 --> 23:51.972
She seems upset, though.
She didn't even want to dance with me.

23:53.015 --> 23:53.974
Are you drunk?

23:55.100 --> 23:56.518
[sniffs] No.

23:57.811 --> 23:59.480
No. Are you drunk?

23:59.563 --> 24:01.565
-No, I'm not.
-You're drunk.

24:01.649 --> 24:04.068
I've never seen you drink before,
this isn't like you.

24:04.151 --> 24:05.027
So what, man?

24:05.110 --> 24:09.823
Maybe it's fine if you just don't want
to be perfect for one second.

24:09.907 --> 24:13.118
You already got detention,
you could get kicked out of school.

24:18.290 --> 24:20.459
-Hey, guess what?
-What?

24:21.043 --> 24:23.712
-I'm ready to have sex again.
-No.

24:23.796 --> 24:27.299
Why are you being so weird? Come on!
Don't you want to do it?

24:27.383 --> 24:29.093
I'm trying to be the good guy here.

24:30.094 --> 24:31.095
Come on.

24:34.181 --> 24:35.808
This is going to be really...

24:36.266 --> 24:37.393
[whispers] special.

24:42.523 --> 24:45.609
I'm looking you right in the eyes.
I'm telling you...

24:45.693 --> 24:47.736
[laughs] No, you're not looking at me.

24:48.028 --> 24:50.030
You’re looking in the mirror.

24:50.823 --> 24:51.991
You're pretty.

24:53.701 --> 24:54.910
Well, yes.

24:55.661 --> 24:57.121
-She is pretty.
-[chuckles]

24:57.746 --> 24:58.747
Alright.

25:01.166 --> 25:04.336
Okay. I'm gonna go get you some water.

25:05.504 --> 25:06.922
[Casey sighs]

25:07.047 --> 25:08.882
Hi, girl. [laughs]

25:12.011 --> 25:14.013
[knocking at door]

25:18.142 --> 25:18.976
Hey.

25:19.893 --> 25:22.354
I know I didn't give you two hours, but...

25:24.064 --> 25:24.898
What's up?

25:25.399 --> 25:26.400
[Elsa sighs]

25:28.110 --> 25:29.194
I think we need to talk.

25:30.362 --> 25:34.491
I waited at Dr. Brob's office
for almost an hour for you and Sam.

25:34.575 --> 25:37.870
And I get it, you're mad at me.
I understand it's completely my fault,

25:37.953 --> 25:40.497
but we still need to be able
to schedule things for the kids.

25:40.581 --> 25:43.542
And I need you to follow through
if you say you're going to do something.

25:46.503 --> 25:47.421
I agree.

25:48.422 --> 25:49.423
You do?

25:50.049 --> 25:51.050
Yeah.

25:52.051 --> 25:54.261
Sam and I thought
it would be better to go to group.

25:54.344 --> 25:55.679
So we did that, but...

25:57.097 --> 25:58.348
[plate clatters]

25:58.557 --> 25:59.975
...I should have told you.

26:01.351 --> 26:02.394
Thank you.

26:03.729 --> 26:05.230
Good, you're both here.

26:05.314 --> 26:07.149
-Hi, honey.
-Hi.

26:08.525 --> 26:10.152
I was thinking about that group.

26:11.236 --> 26:15.741
And, at first, it was dumb and then
it was kind of nice to be a part of it.

26:16.200 --> 26:20.412
And a lot of those kids are just
as strange as me, and if they can do it...

26:22.664 --> 26:25.084
I decided I want to go away to college.

26:25.167 --> 26:26.460
-Really?
-Wow.

26:26.543 --> 26:30.089
And I know there might be stuff
that's hard or scary, but...

26:30.589 --> 26:33.300
everything is changing here anyway,
so I can handle it.

26:34.051 --> 26:36.553
And if I need help I'll ask for it.

26:36.637 --> 26:38.347
Because change is inevitable

26:38.430 --> 26:40.474
and I'm not going
to let all my teeth fall out.

26:40.557 --> 26:42.559
-Your teeth?
-Yes.

26:42.643 --> 26:45.437
And I'm going to graduate
whether we like it or not,

26:45.521 --> 26:48.440
so I might as well get ready
for The Abyss. Sorry, Mom.

26:48.524 --> 26:49.733
Oh, Sam.

26:50.943 --> 26:53.821
It sounds like you really have thought
a lot about this, and...

26:54.488 --> 26:56.448
if this is something you want to do,

26:56.615 --> 26:58.033
then I support you.

27:00.661 --> 27:01.495
Good.

27:02.663 --> 27:04.998
-Where's that cat?
-It's gone.

27:05.415 --> 27:06.834
Good. I don't want to step on it.

27:10.295 --> 27:11.421
I'm gonna go.

27:15.217 --> 27:17.511
[Sam] Lions don't have bad intentions.

27:18.345 --> 27:20.472
They don't eat prey out of spite.

27:20.931 --> 27:23.308
They're just doing
what nature tells them to do.

27:24.143 --> 27:27.354
Like how parents try to protect you,
or...

27:27.437 --> 27:30.357
girlfriends change their mind,
or people leave.

27:31.650 --> 27:34.528
Sometimes I feel like I'm stuck
in that lion's belly.

27:35.237 --> 27:36.697
Like I can't move.

27:37.531 --> 27:39.616
Like no one can see or hear me.

27:43.537 --> 27:45.080
But there's always a way out.

27:50.794 --> 27:52.796
Oh no. Casey!

27:54.256 --> 27:55.382
Oh, shit.

27:56.008 --> 27:57.509
Hey. Hey, get up.

27:57.926 --> 28:00.721
We gotta get you home.
Your parents are gonna kill you.

28:00.804 --> 28:02.097
-Casey.
-No.

28:02.848 --> 28:04.850
Shit.

28:05.058 --> 28:07.060
[takes deep breath]

28:10.731 --> 28:12.733
[rap music playing]

28:30.542 --> 28:32.502
Hey, it's Evan.

28:33.962 --> 28:35.214
Casey's here.

28:38.675 --> 28:39.843
[Christopher groans]

28:39.927 --> 28:41.220
Huh! What?

28:42.429 --> 28:44.723
Great! Now there's two of you.

28:45.724 --> 28:46.767
Mom?

28:47.434 --> 28:48.685
[grunts]

28:49.561 --> 28:51.563
Oh, good. [sighs] You're up.

28:55.317 --> 28:56.985
We have a lot to talk about, young lady.
