WEBVTT

00:05.922 --> 00:07.590
BRAIN TEASER

00:38.705 --> 00:43.376
The Seahawks, my man, that's who.
Legion of Boom.

00:44.252 --> 00:45.670
Twelfth man.

00:47.547 --> 00:51.801
Russell Wilson, back there scrambling,
pulling rabbits out of hats.

00:51.885 --> 00:53.470
Hey, you wanna come over
and watch the combine?

00:54.137 --> 00:56.097
You know, uh, let me see
what I'm doing that night.

00:56.181 --> 00:57.640
You know, it kills me, man.

00:57.766 --> 01:01.186
It just... It kills me that we're playing
our home games in Tacoma.

01:01.269 --> 01:03.396
Stupid zombies. Stupid wall.

01:04.481 --> 01:06.566
-Hey, Clint.

01:07.025 --> 01:09.736
They should've taken
their filthy virus to New England.

01:09.819 --> 01:12.489
Scratch some of those
chowder

01:12.572 --> 01:13.573
Hicks!

01:14.824 --> 01:16.159
Awfully chatty over here, boys.

01:17.494 --> 01:18.536
You meeting your quotas?

01:18.745 --> 01:19.788
Always.

01:19.871 --> 01:22.332
That's what I like to hear. Carry on.

01:28.171 --> 01:31.674
Stupid zombies. Stupid wall.

01:33.051 --> 01:36.888
<i>This is a quarantined zone.</i>
<i>Violators will be shot.</i>

01:36.971 --> 01:39.599
<i>For your safety, vacate this zone at once.</i>

01:40.517 --> 01:44.270
<i>This is a quarantined zone.</i>
<i>Violators will be shot.</i>

01:44.354 --> 01:46.940
<i>For your safety, vacate this zone at once.</i>

01:47.440 --> 01:49.317
Gotta hand it
to the Red, White and Blue. One day, they decide to wall off the city,

01:51.361 --> 01:52.946
and 72 hours later,
we're living in Baghdad.

01:53.029 --> 01:54.864
-No one goes over tonight, Dugan!
-Yes, sir!

01:54.948 --> 01:56.282
Let's see what I got for you this time.

01:56.699 --> 01:59.244
Two of your officers
enjoy playing high-stakes poker.

01:59.327 --> 02:00.870
Croslin and Carney are their names.

02:01.121 --> 02:03.373
And they are in deep to a bookie
they call "The Barber."

02:03.665 --> 02:05.667
Sinclair! Look alive.

02:06.167 --> 02:07.168
What else?

02:07.293 --> 02:08.670
Uh, word is that watered-down brain tubes

02:08.753 --> 02:11.464
are being sold for 40 bucks a pop
in the back alleys of Seattle.

02:11.548 --> 02:14.676
You've got a leak in your food chain.
Someone's getting rich.

02:14.759 --> 02:16.719
Commander. It's here.

02:17.554 --> 02:19.889
Excellent. What else?

02:19.973 --> 02:21.307
All right, here's a riddle for you.

02:21.391 --> 02:23.601
I own a cemetery.
One of my backhoes goes down,

02:23.685 --> 02:25.854
and I'm finding it very difficult
to rent digging equipment.

02:25.937 --> 02:27.355
Why do you think that is?

02:27.730 --> 02:29.983
Where might one want to dig to?

02:33.403 --> 02:34.779
All right, you can stay open another week.

02:36.447 --> 02:38.700
Look, it's not like
I don't enjoy our strolls.

02:38.783 --> 02:40.827
You've really started opening up to me.

02:40.910 --> 02:42.996
But having to bring you
these little nuggets of information

02:43.079 --> 02:46.249
like I'm your stool pigeon
isn't exactly my style.

02:47.417 --> 02:49.377
I could just close down your businesses.

02:52.088 --> 02:54.799
All right, well,
this will have to remain our arrangement.

02:55.425 --> 02:58.386
Hey, man, do you even use
the information that I...

03:01.014 --> 03:03.099
What the cuss?

03:05.643 --> 03:07.145
Is that a guillotine?

03:08.021 --> 03:10.273
Of sorts. It's a guillotine for zombies.

03:10.398 --> 03:13.401
But why? We're zombies.

03:13.484 --> 03:16.404
Zero tolerance. That's our message.

03:20.617 --> 03:22.076
Message received.

03:46.935 --> 03:48.645
I work in a brain processing plant,

03:48.728 --> 03:51.064
and it was the gnarliest thing
I've ever seen.

03:51.147 --> 03:52.565
Clint always volunteered to--

03:52.649 --> 03:54.317
That's Clint Hicks, the victim?

03:54.400 --> 03:57.654
Yeah. Clint Hicks. He volunteered
to pick up some extra hours,

03:57.737 --> 03:59.822
cleaning the equipment
after hours each night.

03:59.906 --> 04:02.742
It's nasty work.
I don't know how he did it.

04:02.825 --> 04:04.118
Oh...

04:04.702 --> 04:06.037
Sorry, no offense.

04:06.120 --> 04:08.539
Oh, none taken. I think.

04:08.665 --> 04:11.042
I mean, you'd probably enjoy
licking the brain bowls clean,

04:11.417 --> 04:14.212
but Fillmore-Graves
doesn't let zombies work the line.

04:14.420 --> 04:16.256
Too much temptation.

04:16.881 --> 04:17.924
Makes sense.

04:19.926 --> 04:22.553
Anyways, Kelly, that's Clint's wife,

04:22.637 --> 04:25.014
she called security last night
at 2:00 in the morning,

04:25.139 --> 04:26.641
says he hasn't come home.

04:27.183 --> 04:30.645
Security comes down here
and finds him in the grinder.

04:31.896 --> 04:34.399
I believe I've arrived
at a cause of death.

04:34.482 --> 04:35.900
"Ground up in a giant mixing bowl."

04:36.859 --> 04:39.737
No. Wait a minute.
Let me recheck my work.

04:41.781 --> 04:44.325
Yeah. "Ground to death in a mixing bowl."

04:44.450 --> 04:45.743
Mr. Perales,

04:46.077 --> 04:48.288
how long have you been working
across from Mr. Hicks?

04:48.955 --> 04:50.623
Um, ever since the plant opened,

04:50.957 --> 04:52.834
right after the world
got turned upside down.

04:52.917 --> 04:54.711
So, what's that, uh, three months?

04:54.794 --> 04:57.797
Nearly four. You know anyone
who might've wanted to kill him?

04:58.589 --> 05:01.467
Well, he wasn't real keen on zombies.

05:01.592 --> 05:02.885
Any particular reason?

05:03.011 --> 05:04.345
Thing you gotta know is that

05:04.470 --> 05:06.472
he's the biggest Seahawks fan
you've ever met.

05:06.597 --> 05:09.976
I've met a lot of crazy Seahawk fans.
Didn't mean they hated zombies.

05:10.101 --> 05:12.312
Yeah, but before everyone
got turned into zombies,

05:12.395 --> 05:15.398
Clint had his dream job
at CenturyLink Field.

05:15.481 --> 05:17.692
And then, boom. We're a zombie town.

05:18.484 --> 05:22.530
After that, instead of a job he loved,
he's packaging human brains by day,

05:22.613 --> 05:24.365
cleaning them
out of the grinders by night.

05:25.158 --> 05:29.245
He was always complaining about zombies.
Sometimes a little too loud.

05:29.746 --> 05:33.291
I mean, the Fillmore-Graves guys here
aren't the warmest dudes.

05:34.292 --> 05:36.419
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

05:37.003 --> 05:39.922
I didn't mean like "warmest,"
I just meant like...

05:40.006 --> 05:41.632
No. Of course. I'm fine.

05:41.716 --> 05:43.092
I just meant they're not friendly.

05:43.176 --> 05:44.969
This new world's gonna take
some getting used to.

05:46.095 --> 05:49.599
Why bother? Someone's probably
going to nuke us any day now.

06:18.586 --> 06:19.754
Sir.

06:27.720 --> 06:28.763
Sir!

06:30.765 --> 06:33.601
I know you're aware of the curfew.
No one out on the streets after midnight.

06:33.684 --> 06:36.854
Come on, man. Check this out.
I met this girl at the club...

06:37.563 --> 06:38.981
Go home!
You suck!

06:39.482 --> 06:41.317
-Zombie scum!
-You freaks!

06:41.400 --> 06:42.443
-No.
-Come on, let's go.

07:01.045 --> 07:02.505
Let me go, you undead freak.

07:05.716 --> 07:09.303
I baked your buddies good, didn't I?
Didn't I?

07:15.059 --> 07:16.102
Major. Come.

07:18.729 --> 07:19.689
Sit.

07:20.189 --> 07:21.357
Yes, sir.

07:24.402 --> 07:25.987
I hear last night was eventful.

07:27.113 --> 07:29.824
Gully and Chu were hit
by a Molotov cocktail,

07:29.907 --> 07:31.742
but they'll be okay in a couple of weeks.

07:31.868 --> 07:34.495
And I hear you caught
one of our human terrorist friends.

07:34.579 --> 07:38.082
What do they call themselves?
"Human Shield"

07:38.791 --> 07:40.001
"Dead Enders."

07:40.501 --> 07:43.212
We're not sure he's a member.
I mean, the kid's only 15.

07:44.088 --> 07:46.466
Well, that kind of segues right into
what I wanted to talk to you about.

07:47.800 --> 07:49.927
We noticed you have
a background in youth counseling.

07:50.720 --> 07:51.596
Yeah.

07:51.762 --> 07:54.348
Well, there's a problem in this city
you must've noticed.

07:54.807 --> 07:56.058
Young zombies.

07:56.767 --> 07:59.479
They're homeless
because their parents kicked them out.

07:59.979 --> 08:02.565
They're starting to roam around in packs.
Packs become gangs.

08:04.108 --> 08:05.735
We need productive, contributing zombies,

08:05.818 --> 08:07.862
fully integrated into
the fabric of the city.

08:09.363 --> 08:10.698
You think you can give me that?

08:11.699 --> 08:12.950
I can give it a shot.

08:13.201 --> 08:14.160
Excellent.

08:14.785 --> 08:16.078
<i>Chase Graves, man.</i>

08:18.080 --> 08:20.374
What's he got that I don't got, Dad?

08:20.750 --> 08:23.085
Oh, that's right. An army.

08:25.963 --> 08:28.299
"Mo' money, mo' problems."

08:29.842 --> 08:33.429
I want to expand, Pop,
but he's got me by the short and curlies.

08:33.513 --> 08:34.931
He could shut me down any day.

08:35.765 --> 08:38.643
And this whole business
of me having to seek him out every week

08:38.726 --> 08:40.520
to feed him dirt from the street,

08:40.603 --> 08:44.232
like I'm some sort of two-bit
street hustler, is humiliating.

08:46.025 --> 08:48.486
It's a shame
you raised me to like nice things.

08:52.865 --> 08:56.953
Love you. Mean it. Ciao.

09:01.666 --> 09:04.794
Dino! Chop, chop. Let's go.

09:08.756 --> 09:09.966
This is the one.

09:10.049 --> 09:12.134
Check it out.

09:12.593 --> 09:14.887
Russell Wilson, I would have your babies.

09:18.599 --> 09:20.393
Try to dial it down a bit, Liv.

09:20.476 --> 09:23.312
Let's not remind them
that zombie cops eat their loved ones.

09:23.396 --> 09:24.647
Zombies are the worst.

09:25.314 --> 09:26.941
Pale-ass, brain-eating bitches.

09:28.192 --> 09:31.320
Looks like they just put this poster here
to cover up some gang taggings.

09:34.699 --> 09:35.533
Yes

09:36.701 --> 09:37.535
Yes.

09:37.868 --> 09:40.121
We're with the Seattle PD. Homicide.

09:40.454 --> 09:43.124
We'd like to come in
and ask you a few questions. Do you mind?

09:52.675 --> 09:55.428
So, you clocked out at the plant
at 6:00 p.m. Is that right?

09:55.720 --> 09:58.472
Thereabouts, yeah.
It'd be on my time card.

09:58.598 --> 10:01.100
What time does your husband
usually get home from his cleaning duties?

10:01.475 --> 10:03.978
Uh, about 9:00. Could you set that down?

10:04.437 --> 10:07.732
A Seahawks salt shaker?
It's pretty damn awesome.

10:07.815 --> 10:08.983
Liv.

10:11.068 --> 10:13.696
Sorry, Mom. I guess I missed that one.

10:14.196 --> 10:16.282
Detective Babineaux and, um...

10:16.949 --> 10:18.659
Assistant Medical Examiner Moore.

10:19.368 --> 10:22.955
...are just asking some questions.
This is my son, Zorn. Like Jim Zorn?
The Hawks' QB from '76 to '84?

10:27.460 --> 10:28.628
That's the guy.

10:28.711 --> 10:30.880
I take it you're not on
the Seahawks bandwagon.

10:31.047 --> 10:32.923
Not since February 1st, 2015.

10:33.341 --> 10:34.300
What happened?

10:34.884 --> 10:36.469
Super Bowl XLIX.

10:36.552 --> 10:38.679
Patriots, 28. Seahawks, 24.

10:38.929 --> 10:40.306
That game ruined my dad.

10:40.514 --> 10:42.892
After that day, he became
completely single-minded.

10:42.975 --> 10:45.102
If it wasn't about the Seahawks,
he wasn't interested.

10:45.186 --> 10:46.979
Zorn, where were you
when your father was murdered?

10:47.104 --> 10:48.356
I was right here with Mom.

10:48.522 --> 10:50.691
So, the two of you
were here together all night?

10:50.816 --> 10:51.859
That's right.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.779
We understand that
Clint might not have had

10:54.862 --> 10:57.406
the most enlightened views about zombies.

11:01.369 --> 11:03.037
Who needs enlightenment, am I right?

11:04.955 --> 11:07.333
I guess what we're asking is
whether your husband

11:07.416 --> 11:09.460
might've had any run-ins with zombies.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.671
None that he told me about,

11:11.879 --> 11:16.592
but he was in a bit of a war
with this one guy from work.

11:16.717 --> 11:17.843
A war?

11:17.927 --> 11:21.639
Well, it started as smack talk,
but it got out of hand.

11:22.640 --> 11:26.227
The last thing I heard was
this guy keyed Clint's car.

11:27.019 --> 11:29.939
Wrote something that
riled up my husband.

11:30.022 --> 11:31.065
You remember what it said?

11:31.273 --> 11:33.025
"Richard Sherman
is an average cornerback."

11:33.526 --> 11:34.777
-Liv...

11:36.112 --> 11:41.117
That's kind of a lengthy thought
to express in that, um, particular medium.

11:41.200 --> 11:44.120
Yeah, well, they really hated each other.

11:45.454 --> 11:46.664
Doc Greeley's his name.

11:47.998 --> 11:49.458
He's from San Francisco.

11:50.251 --> 11:52.420
San Francisco?

11:52.878 --> 11:57.675
San Fran, baby. City by the bay.
How are we superior?

11:57.758 --> 12:00.219
Uh, well, first thing
that springs to mind is

12:00.302 --> 12:03.514
at least we don't have
10,000 zombies walled in with us.

12:03.597 --> 12:07.810
I'm about to give you
49 reasons you're an idiot.

12:07.893 --> 12:09.895
Oh, yeah

12:11.021 --> 12:12.314
That's what I thought. Boom.

12:12.398 --> 12:14.358
Monorail or no monorail? Suck it.

12:15.484 --> 12:18.571
Clint's widow says that you keyed
something about Richard Sherman

12:18.654 --> 12:20.114
-on the hood of Clint's car.

12:20.906 --> 12:22.783
Sherman would light you up, son.

12:22.867 --> 12:26.912
It's because he spray-painted
"Go Hawks" on the top of my car.

12:29.123 --> 12:30.791
I'm a Niners fan, okay?

12:30.875 --> 12:33.752
I... I have a sticker on my car, sure,

12:33.836 --> 12:39.008
but, like most of America,
it's because I hate the Seahawks.

12:39.091 --> 12:41.802
I hate how cocky they are.

12:41.886 --> 12:43.888
It ain't cocky if you can back it up.

12:45.139 --> 12:46.348
It's true. They're awful.

12:48.350 --> 12:50.311
Where were you the night of the murder?

12:50.769 --> 12:51.854
At home.

12:51.937 --> 12:53.647
-Yeah.

12:54.356 --> 12:56.734
-Yes.

12:57.860 --> 12:59.487
Show him, Clive.

13:06.076 --> 13:07.286
What am I looking at here?

13:08.412 --> 13:10.206
That's the parking lot where you work.

13:12.416 --> 13:15.002
And this is security footage
taken of the parking lot

13:15.085 --> 13:16.795
the night of Clint's murder.

13:17.004 --> 13:18.797
You didn't know
there was a camera there, did you?

13:20.758 --> 13:23.385
Note the time code
at the bottom of the screen.

13:23.677 --> 13:25.137
It's right in the two-hour window

13:25.221 --> 13:27.765
our medical examiners
have given us for time of death.

13:27.932 --> 13:29.058
Hmm.

13:29.600 --> 13:33.020
Pretty obvious
that's your white 2015 Sonata.

13:33.312 --> 13:35.689
You failed to mention that
you drove back to work

13:35.773 --> 13:37.316
on the night of the murder.

13:37.483 --> 13:39.401
That seems like a big omission.

13:39.527 --> 13:41.529
Look, I'm being set up here.

13:42.321 --> 13:43.822
Typical Niners fan.

13:44.657 --> 13:47.993
It's never your fault.
"It's the ref's. It's the injuries."

13:48.118 --> 13:52.248
I got home that night
and found 20 brain tubes in my bag.

13:52.873 --> 13:54.416
I don't know how they got there.

13:54.500 --> 13:55.834
But you don't want to know

13:56.126 --> 13:58.963
the punishment for stealing brains.

14:00.130 --> 14:03.467
I went back to work to put them back.

14:03.551 --> 14:05.177
Why'd you lie to us?

14:05.261 --> 14:08.138
He's a Niners fan, Clive.
They do dumb things.

14:08.222 --> 14:10.182
They re-signed Blaine Gabbert,
for God sakes.

14:10.474 --> 14:11.642
Oh, I'm sorry, you want to talk "dumb"?

14:11.725 --> 14:13.602
"Dumb," like running off Jim Harbaugh?

14:13.852 --> 14:16.939
At least we would've known
you run Marshawn Lynch

14:17.398 --> 14:20.025
against a gassed
New England defensive line,

14:20.109 --> 14:23.696
when you have three downs
to win the mother-freaking Super Bowl.

14:26.991 --> 14:30.160
Liv. Remain calm.

14:30.494 --> 14:32.371
You're going full-on zombie.

14:33.038 --> 14:36.959
It's called "beast mode."

14:38.794 --> 14:41.213
We meet at the same time every day.

14:41.380 --> 14:43.257
Where are Clive and Liv?

14:44.758 --> 14:47.219
Oh, good. Everything okay?

14:48.178 --> 14:50.723
We like this guy we brought in
for the brain-factory killing.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.516
A 49ers fan.

14:53.267 --> 14:56.103
We're gonna hold him for a full 48
until we can get a search warrant

14:56.186 --> 14:57.688
to see if we can seal this up tight.

14:58.272 --> 14:59.398
Sounds good.

14:59.481 --> 15:01.775
Halpern and Schumacker,
how's it going on the John Doe

15:01.859 --> 15:02.860
they found on the east wall?

15:03.360 --> 15:05.696
All I know so far is our John Doe
watched a lot of porn.

15:07.740 --> 15:10.451
So, you and me, we're getting
the smarty Physics professor at U-Dub.
Everything points to the wife.

15:13.329 --> 15:15.247
Not sure if I even need to eat the brain.

15:16.457 --> 15:18.834
Well, might be nice riding around
with my intellectual equal.

15:19.001 --> 15:21.503
Mmm. Well, who would laugh
at all your fart jokes?

15:23.213 --> 15:26.133
The victim is Ben Rooney. Age 58.

15:26.216 --> 15:28.677
Professor of Physics
from the University of Washington.

15:32.556 --> 15:34.058
The injury has resulted

15:34.141 --> 15:38.187
from a single blow
to the occipital region of the head.

15:39.813 --> 15:41.273
Brain weight...

15:43.776 --> 15:47.154
Thirteen hundred and fifty grams.

15:48.072 --> 15:51.951
Uh, brain appears healthy,
damage from the blunt force trauma aside.

15:52.743 --> 15:53.869
It's, uh...

15:54.703 --> 15:56.205
Pink.

15:58.207 --> 15:59.375
Firm.

16:02.169 --> 16:03.712
Smell of...

16:09.885 --> 16:11.136
Lilacs.

16:15.307 --> 16:16.642
Taste of...

16:22.147 --> 16:23.315
Melon.

16:25.234 --> 16:27.361
Honeydew, I would think.

16:39.498 --> 16:42.209
Subject's hair has begun to turn white.

16:42.626 --> 16:45.045
This is the third time
subject has turned into a zombie

16:45.129 --> 16:47.214
since taking the proto-vaccine.

16:47.548 --> 16:49.299
If trends continue,

16:49.925 --> 16:53.262
zombie state should last
no more than 72 hours.

16:54.722 --> 16:55.806
Huh...

16:55.889 --> 16:59.476
On the bright side, the vaccine works.

16:59.810 --> 17:04.189
Subject has been scratched by
his zombie assistant several times now,

17:04.732 --> 17:06.692
and he remains human.

17:09.653 --> 17:14.700
With the small caveat that
every few weeks, subject craves brains.

17:23.959 --> 17:25.794
I see it's your time of the month.

17:25.878 --> 17:27.004
It's obvious?

17:27.713 --> 17:29.339
You're wearing that stocking cap indoors.

17:30.424 --> 17:32.426
Plus, zombies have this stench to them.

17:33.260 --> 17:34.803
I've never noticed.

17:34.928 --> 17:37.264
It's true. They smell. They're disgusting.

17:37.598 --> 17:40.142
On that note, I'm going to call it a day.

17:41.977 --> 17:45.064
Oh, this professor whose brain I ate
patented all these inventions.

17:45.147 --> 17:48.567
Maybe inspiration will strike,
and I'll make a fortune.

17:51.528 --> 17:53.739
...more cash in my pocket
than I can spend.

17:53.822 --> 17:55.699
Hey, if they didn't want it
sold on the black market,

17:55.783 --> 17:57.618
they wouldn't have made it so scarce.

17:58.118 --> 18:01.121
Hey. You, hiding. Show yourself.

18:15.844 --> 18:17.096
You're not gonna eat that?

18:17.179 --> 18:18.472
I'm saving the rest.

18:19.681 --> 18:22.935
Give me a bite, dude. I'm starving
and you weigh, like, 40 pounds.

18:23.018 --> 18:24.019
I'm saving it.

18:24.103 --> 18:25.312
Give it to me.

18:25.729 --> 18:27.272
Or when we get out of here,

18:27.356 --> 18:30.484
I'm going to rip off one of your arms
and beat you with it.

18:32.778 --> 18:34.071
He said he's saving it.

18:35.155 --> 18:36.365
And who are you?

18:37.574 --> 18:39.034
Captain Seattle?

18:42.371 --> 18:43.455
You two.

18:45.415 --> 18:46.458
Sit.

18:52.297 --> 18:53.465
I wanna thank all of you

18:53.549 --> 18:55.926
for agreeing to come here
to Fillmore-Graves' headquarters.

18:56.009 --> 18:58.720
Yeah. We're all "volunteers."

18:59.096 --> 19:00.389
You're here for a reason.

19:00.514 --> 19:02.516
You've been living on the streets.

19:02.599 --> 19:05.102
Most of you were thrown out of your homes
for being zombies.

19:05.352 --> 19:08.772
Thanks for that, by the way,
the "turning us into zombies" part.

19:09.857 --> 19:11.066
Look, what's done is done.

19:11.316 --> 19:12.901
It's time to make the best of it.

19:13.152 --> 19:15.863
All right, our goal here
is to get you off the streets.

19:15.946 --> 19:18.115
Prevent the formation
of zombie street-gangs.

19:18.699 --> 19:21.160
The key to our survival is integration.

19:21.243 --> 19:22.327
Tell that to the Dead Enders.

19:22.578 --> 19:26.582
Is it true that Fillmore-Graves soldiers
get all the brain tubes they want?

19:27.040 --> 19:28.292
We get double rations.

19:28.542 --> 19:31.336
Did everyone see that
brain vending machine in the hallway?

19:35.132 --> 19:37.301
No, really. Is there?

19:38.886 --> 19:39.720
There is.

19:41.180 --> 19:44.766
So, I'm out there every day
trading sex for brain tubes

19:44.850 --> 19:46.268
to feed my little brother and sister,

19:46.351 --> 19:48.187
and you get to eat them
like they're candy bars?

19:49.271 --> 19:50.814
-You really...
-No.

19:50.939 --> 19:52.900
I work at coffee stands.

19:52.983 --> 19:55.402
But I do know plenty of girls
who are putting out for tubes.

19:55.485 --> 19:57.070
And some dudes.

19:58.197 --> 20:01.283
My brother and sister really are starving.

20:01.700 --> 20:05.495
And the brain tubes they distribute
barely have any brains in them anymore.

20:13.003 --> 20:14.213
Check out this guy.

20:15.839 --> 20:16.965
Who's that?

20:17.049 --> 20:19.843
A Fillmore-Graves soldier.
Jimmy sketched him for me.

20:19.968 --> 20:22.054
I saw this guy in a vision.
He was hatching a plan

20:22.137 --> 20:23.472
to make a fortune on the black market.

20:23.972 --> 20:25.641
Then he caught our victim listening in.

20:26.016 --> 20:27.142
Did he look mad?

20:27.226 --> 20:28.477
He didn't look happy.

20:29.603 --> 20:32.564
I figured we could go ask Major
if he can ID the guy.

20:32.981 --> 20:34.233
Unless you have plans?

20:39.112 --> 20:40.405
My night's wide open.

20:42.032 --> 20:45.369
You sure Major's gonna be willing to
rat on one of his Fillmore

20:45.452 --> 20:48.038
If he's stealing brains
from hungry zombies, yeah.

20:49.206 --> 20:52.125
If you say so. You know him better.

21:01.134 --> 21:02.594
What are you saying he's guilty of?

21:03.053 --> 21:05.639
-Uh, murder.
-Possibly.

21:05.847 --> 21:08.725
Plus, I saw him talking to
another Fillmore-Graves soldier

21:08.809 --> 21:10.435
about selling brain tubes
on the black market.

21:10.519 --> 21:12.229
So, we know he's doing that.

21:16.233 --> 21:17.150
Major.

21:19.194 --> 21:20.570
His name is Russ Roche.

21:21.238 --> 21:23.198
And the black-market thing makes sense.

21:23.282 --> 21:25.117
I hear he's been going
to The Scratching Post every night,

21:25.200 --> 21:26.994
throwing money around
like there's no tomorrow.

21:27.661 --> 21:28.870
Liv. Clive.

21:30.330 --> 21:32.207
To what do we owe the pleasure?

21:32.291 --> 21:34.960
-Ravi, you're, um...
-Naked.

21:36.503 --> 21:37.379
As a newborn.

21:39.131 --> 21:40.924
I can't... Mmm-mmm.

21:41.758 --> 21:43.468
Uh, I... I can't...

21:43.552 --> 21:44.845
I should've given you guys a warning.

21:45.095 --> 21:47.639
Apparently, this physicist
whose brain he's on? Yeah.

21:47.723 --> 21:49.349
Must've been a big-time nudist as well.

21:49.433 --> 21:53.103
"Naturist." I'm in harmony with nature,
and I'm never going back.

21:54.187 --> 21:55.355
Anyone else like tea?

22:00.861 --> 22:02.654
I don't know. Maybe.

22:04.323 --> 22:05.782
What's there to think about?

22:05.866 --> 22:08.493
Buddy, look at these lovely ladies,

22:08.577 --> 22:11.830
eager to show you
and your buddy a good time.

22:11.913 --> 22:14.499
"Eager," huh

22:14.916 --> 22:16.209
It's her thing.

22:16.626 --> 22:20.672
She's a tough girl. Sassy.
Some guys like it.

22:20.797 --> 22:22.924
I don't. Get rid of her.
I'll take the other two.

22:23.258 --> 22:24.384
You, go mingle.

22:24.509 --> 22:27.220
Hey, bring us some booze, huh?
The good stuff!

22:27.304 --> 22:28.430
Can do.

22:33.685 --> 22:37.439
No. No. No. You've got the wrong place.

22:37.522 --> 22:40.901
The pancake house where the cops
eat for free, it's just down the street.

22:41.359 --> 22:43.987
That guy at the booth,
how much money is he gonna drop tonight?

22:45.906 --> 22:47.449
Let me see.

22:47.532 --> 22:50.660
Whole blue brain from some big-deal
Shakespearean actor,

22:50.744 --> 22:55.957
five bottles of the good stuff,
four companions... None of your business.

22:59.044 --> 23:02.464
Oh, what, are you on third
Tanner!

23:02.839 --> 23:06.218
Another bottle of
the Devil's Puckered Knot, Small Batch.

23:06.343 --> 23:07.385
Come on.

23:09.888 --> 23:11.139
Excuse me.

23:12.682 --> 23:15.977
-Clive Babineaux. Seattle PD. Homicide.

23:16.103 --> 23:18.105
Not interested. You...

23:18.855 --> 23:22.359
You can stay, honey.
I just need you to go tan and...

23:24.444 --> 23:25.320
Vision.

23:25.737 --> 23:28.365
A blue brain vision. It's a long one.

23:32.911 --> 23:34.955
Is this jackanapes still about?

23:35.580 --> 23:38.250
Get thee gone, sir,
afore I box thine ears.

23:38.750 --> 23:40.335
All right, Shakespeare.

23:40.418 --> 23:44.131
Handmaiden to Venus,
vouchsafe me your cheveril ornament.

23:44.214 --> 23:45.048
Huh?

23:45.590 --> 23:48.093
Your glove, harlot. Make haste.

23:48.552 --> 23:49.386
Jeez.

23:50.720 --> 23:53.682
You trespass, sir,
and know not what you do.

23:53.765 --> 23:56.726
So I shall teach thee, knave,
and teach thee true.

24:03.650 --> 24:04.860
I wouldn't.

24:07.445 --> 24:08.446
Time out!

24:10.115 --> 24:12.075
Time out.

24:12.284 --> 24:15.537
Detective Babineaux,
you're not in Seattle anymore.

24:15.704 --> 24:17.164
This is New Seattle,

24:17.914 --> 24:21.585
and in New Seattle,
cops, they don't come into my bar...

24:21.668 --> 24:23.211
-Our bar.
-Right.

24:23.295 --> 24:26.965
...to hassle the fine, fine
Fillmore-Graves soldiers

24:27.048 --> 24:29.301
who protect this city's undead population.

24:29.384 --> 24:31.845
I had a vision from the guy
who was murdered at the brain plant.

24:32.012 --> 24:34.431
He saw you talking about
selling brains on the black market.

24:35.599 --> 24:36.766
That's why you killed him, isn't it?

24:36.850 --> 24:39.811
The worker overheard a joke. But a jape.

24:41.605 --> 24:45.192
Innkeep, tell me plain,
must I endure the ravings of a starveling?

24:46.401 --> 24:49.487
A neat's tongue

24:50.572 --> 24:52.240
Away, ivory cur.

24:52.782 --> 24:55.911
Thou art a boil.
Tarry not, lest ye be lanced.

24:57.287 --> 24:58.872
You... You heard the man.

24:59.789 --> 25:01.082
All bull pizzles hit the road.

25:01.917 --> 25:03.835
Dino, show them the exit.

25:03.919 --> 25:06.296
Then come clean up this mess, huh?

25:06.546 --> 25:07.923
Do I look like a waitress?

25:09.049 --> 25:11.176
You are whatever I tell you you are.

25:17.224 --> 25:18.350
Sure thing, boss.

25:41.831 --> 25:42.958
Get it all out.

25:45.126 --> 25:46.920
I would've gotten you out sooner,

25:48.171 --> 25:51.299
but Blaine didn't start having me
drive him here until recently.

25:51.383 --> 25:52.801
I had to pick the right time.

25:53.718 --> 25:55.428
Wrap your arms around me.

26:09.150 --> 26:10.694
Two-bit hustler!

26:14.114 --> 26:15.198
That's Blaine.

26:15.865 --> 26:18.326
And a voice called down upon Angus

26:18.827 --> 26:19.953
and, lo,

26:20.328 --> 26:23.123
two-bit hustlers were had
by their short and curlies.

26:24.207 --> 26:26.876
More money, more problems!

26:27.002 --> 26:28.586
I'm glad you brought up money, boss,

26:29.254 --> 26:32.048
'cause I figure my getting you out of here
is worth some kind of reward.

26:32.299 --> 26:37.387
And the voice of the herald
cried, "Shame."

26:38.096 --> 26:40.181
It's a shame.

26:41.349 --> 26:42.517
Think about it.

26:47.397 --> 26:49.607
You work on those cement shoes.

26:49.816 --> 26:51.609
I've gotta call my girlfriend.

26:56.281 --> 26:58.783
Sorry, baby. This is taking longer
than I thought.

26:59.284 --> 27:03.330
We haven't discussed a dollar amount yet,
but he'll see the light.

27:03.413 --> 27:04.998
I'm thinking six figures

27:08.710 --> 27:10.628
Filthy, filthy lucre.

27:44.329 --> 27:47.499
Mr. Mayor! Such an honor, as always.

27:47.582 --> 27:51.002
Mr. DeBeers. I'd eat every meal here
if I could afford it.

27:51.211 --> 27:53.088
You can't go wrong
with anything on the menu.

27:53.171 --> 27:54.381
What would you recommend?

27:54.964 --> 27:58.385
Um, the Ode to Zuni roast brain
with fennel panzanella.

27:58.468 --> 27:59.469
Oh.

27:59.552 --> 28:02.555
And here are the brains
that you can choose from.

28:02.639 --> 28:04.057
Everything is cemetery-to-table.

28:04.140 --> 28:05.642
And if I may be so bold,

28:05.725 --> 28:08.436
our freshest brain comes from
an architect of some renown.

28:08.853 --> 28:09.979
Sold!

28:10.105 --> 28:11.272
I'll have the same.

28:11.606 --> 28:14.025
Ms. Charles, what can we get for you?

28:14.359 --> 28:17.153
I'll have the T-bone, rare.
And another bourbon rocks.

28:17.278 --> 28:18.279
Fine choice.

28:18.530 --> 28:19.489
The flounder for me.

28:20.031 --> 28:21.282
I would've guessed the flounder.

28:22.909 --> 28:24.953
So, what were we talking about?

28:25.078 --> 28:26.955
-The exodus.
-Right.

28:27.080 --> 28:30.083
How many humans got out?
Before the wall went up.

28:30.166 --> 28:33.545
A couple hundred thousand.
It's lucky for us they did wall the city.

28:34.087 --> 28:35.547
If all you innocent humans left,

28:35.630 --> 28:37.757
they'd drop an atom bomb
right on Pioneer Square.

28:38.007 --> 28:38.967
You're welcome.

28:39.050 --> 28:41.052
But now Chase Graves
decrees a death penalty

28:41.136 --> 28:42.554
for scratching someone? Come on.

28:42.637 --> 28:46.391
Well, there aren't enough brains
to feed the zombies who are here already.

28:46.474 --> 28:47.809
We shouldn't make more.

28:47.892 --> 28:49.686
"Clip your nails, no epic fails."

28:49.769 --> 28:52.397
I don't think
he'll actually use the guillotine.

28:52.564 --> 28:55.567
It's there to scare zombies,
and to give humans a sense

28:55.650 --> 28:58.027
that zombies are serious
about policing themselves.

28:59.487 --> 29:00.864
I hope you're right.

29:03.700 --> 29:05.285
God, you are gorgeous.

29:13.084 --> 29:15.003
Well, that sure kills the mood.

29:15.420 --> 29:17.380
I don't think it was here this morning.

29:17.464 --> 29:19.549
It's scary. It's like a cross burning.

29:19.966 --> 29:23.386
Shh! This slot receiver from USC
is about to show off his vertical.

29:23.470 --> 29:26.389
And if he hits 35, I say we use
our second-round pick on him.

29:26.473 --> 29:28.057
Mind if I grab a beer?

29:28.725 --> 29:30.351
No, there's an IPA down in
the crisper, behind the...

29:32.562 --> 29:33.688
Oh, my God.

29:33.813 --> 29:34.773
Oh, my God.

29:34.856 --> 29:37.358
Oh, hey.
Liv invited me over for the combine.

29:37.484 --> 29:38.443
You're naked.

29:40.028 --> 29:42.572
Right. I, uh, I forget sometimes.

29:42.822 --> 29:45.658
Uh, Ravi, would you mind
putting on some clothes?

29:45.742 --> 29:48.453
Oh, uh, Dr. Ravi Chakrabarti.
I don't believe we've had the pleasure.

29:48.745 --> 29:51.956
Right. Sorry. Uh, Ravi, this is Derek.

29:52.457 --> 29:54.959
Derek, this is Ravi.

29:55.084 --> 29:56.169
Ravi is a nudist.

29:58.004 --> 30:00.548
-Derek Edelsburg.
-Right, the lawyer.

30:01.216 --> 30:03.092
I've heard nothing but great things.

30:04.594 --> 30:05.762
Queso!

30:09.307 --> 30:10.266
No!

30:10.809 --> 30:14.646
Liv, no, he is not sitting on our couch.
We can throw down a towel, or we can...

30:14.729 --> 30:17.065
You put this stud
at weak-side defensive end,

30:17.148 --> 30:19.234
and he will eat quarterbacks. I mean...

30:19.317 --> 30:20.610
Liv, sweetie.

30:20.693 --> 30:22.237
I need to show you something
out in the hall.

30:22.362 --> 30:23.321
But...

30:23.404 --> 30:27.367
Oh, look. Look. They're going to
commercial. Just give me two minutes.

30:28.827 --> 30:29.869
Come on.

30:30.662 --> 30:32.247
How do you know Peyton?

30:36.626 --> 30:37.669
Look.  "Z."

30:42.757 --> 30:44.008
For "zebra."

30:44.425 --> 30:46.761
The referees read what I wrote
on their NFL fan board,

30:46.845 --> 30:48.012
and this is their revenge.

30:48.805 --> 30:52.559
Liv, it's for "zombie."
As in "a zombie lives here."

30:52.809 --> 30:55.895
People are marking the houses
of suspected zombies this way.

30:57.272 --> 30:58.273
I need to find Clive.

30:59.524 --> 31:01.150
Wait, what do I do about Ravi?

31:01.234 --> 31:03.736
I say get back together with him.

31:06.656 --> 31:09.784
So, if I'm not mistaken...

31:14.622 --> 31:16.875
A "Z." A zombie lives here.

31:19.502 --> 31:20.920
But it wasn't the dad.

31:21.254 --> 31:24.549
I ate his brain
and he was decidedly anti-zombie.

31:24.632 --> 31:26.301
Although, who can blame him?

31:29.470 --> 31:32.515
Well, the mom didn't seem
very keen on zombies, either.

31:34.058 --> 31:35.435
Could be an act.

31:37.604 --> 31:38.479
Officers.

31:38.730 --> 31:39.814
Mrs. Hicks.

31:39.981 --> 31:43.443
By the powers granted
in Fillmore-Graves' decree number 176,

31:43.526 --> 31:44.944
we'll be taking your blood pressure.

31:45.778 --> 31:46.738
Your arm, please.

31:47.155 --> 31:48.531
Liv, cuff her.

31:54.579 --> 31:55.663
Mom?

31:58.249 --> 31:59.292
Come here, son.

32:01.586 --> 32:02.712
Human.

32:03.296 --> 32:04.297
Give me your arm.

32:08.176 --> 32:11.012
He's a zombie!
The stupid son of a bitch did it!

32:11.179 --> 32:13.681
He couldn't keep it in his pants
with his little zombie girlfriend!

32:13.765 --> 32:16.351
-I raised you better! Get out! Get out!

32:16.434 --> 32:17.602
Clint!

32:17.810 --> 32:18.853
Oh...

32:19.771 --> 32:23.024
Touch me again, and I'll eat your brain.
I swear I will.

32:25.443 --> 32:26.653
Zorn here is a zombie.

32:27.153 --> 32:29.197
A law-abiding, in-the-closet zombie.
What's wrong with that?

32:36.329 --> 32:39.290
You should know that
my partner here has, uh,

32:40.249 --> 32:41.834
sampled your father's brain.

32:42.961 --> 32:46.047
She's able to experience
moments from the deceased's life.

32:46.130 --> 32:49.717
I just saw an incident where
he pushed Zorn down this flight of steps.

32:49.801 --> 32:51.010
Zorn threatened to eat his brain.

32:51.594 --> 32:53.638
I'm afraid we need
to take you down to the station.

32:54.681 --> 32:55.974
Turn around, please.

32:58.643 --> 33:02.230
Zorn Hicks, you have the right
to remain silent.

33:02.355 --> 33:04.148
-He didn't do it.
-Mom, don't!

33:04.816 --> 33:07.193
I read that these visions
aren't admissible. They don't have--

33:07.276 --> 33:11.364
The brain tubes in Doc Greeley's bag,
you put them there, didn't you?

33:11.447 --> 33:15.159
You knew that he'd come back up
to the brain plant to put them back.

33:15.243 --> 33:19.038
You set him up.
You wanted to pin this on the 49ers fan.

33:19.122 --> 33:21.708
Clive, I still think that he may
have played a part in this.

33:21.791 --> 33:22.792
Mom, I'm a minor--

33:22.875 --> 33:25.628
Confess and we may forget
that you made your son

33:25.712 --> 33:28.715
an accomplice by having him
provide a false alibi.

33:33.678 --> 33:34.595
I did it.

33:36.389 --> 33:37.849
Clint made me choose.

33:38.891 --> 33:43.312
My husband or my son.
He never should have made me choose.

33:49.152 --> 33:50.403
Kelly Hicks,

33:54.115 --> 33:56.200
you have the right to remain silent.

33:56.284 --> 33:57.618
-Zombie scum!

33:57.702 --> 33:59.412
You said it, man! Go Hawks!

33:59.495 --> 34:00.788
Go Hawks!

34:06.919 --> 34:09.672
The first time I raged out,
it freaked me out so bad.

34:09.756 --> 34:11.674
It was like my first, um...

34:11.758 --> 34:14.469
Nocturnal emission.
I was like, "What just happened?"

34:16.721 --> 34:21.017
My first time,
my dad was waling away on me, as usual.

34:22.018 --> 34:26.272
And then, suddenly, I'm like...

34:26.939 --> 34:28.232
Scared the hell out of him.

34:28.566 --> 34:30.735
I chased the son of a bitch
around the block.

34:32.487 --> 34:36.199
So, at my school, there's this
stuck-up bitch named Gretchen Nelson,

34:36.449 --> 34:39.118
who kind of knew I was a zombie
but I hadn't come out yet.

34:39.202 --> 34:40.411
-And so--
-Captain Seattle.

34:41.120 --> 34:42.497
How many brain tubes is that for you?

34:43.664 --> 34:44.707
Two.

34:44.999 --> 34:46.209
Dude. Lie.

34:46.334 --> 34:47.710
And where did you get two?

34:47.794 --> 34:49.462
You were only supposed to get one
for showing up.

34:49.545 --> 34:50.421
Uh...

34:50.630 --> 34:52.381
Looks like everyone got extra tubes.

34:52.715 --> 34:54.801
Oh, well, the lady handing them out
said she had extra.

34:55.218 --> 34:58.971
And she made us promise not to tell, so,
don't be a dick and get her in trouble.

34:59.555 --> 35:01.724
So, this is what you well-fed

35:01.808 --> 35:04.977
Fillmore-Graves soldiers
feel like all the time.

35:05.103 --> 35:07.271
Happy. Ready to kick ass.

35:09.690 --> 35:13.236
Uh... We were talking about
our first times raging out.

35:13.778 --> 35:14.779
Jordan, keep going.

35:15.196 --> 35:16.030
Lillywhite...

35:18.032 --> 35:19.992
You know why the machines
are out of tubes?

35:24.622 --> 35:25.832
Uh-uh.

35:25.998 --> 35:28.084
Sucks, man.

35:32.755 --> 35:33.714
Jordan.

35:34.465 --> 35:35.299
Yeah.

35:36.634 --> 35:41.639
So, Gretchen is saying stuff like,
"Looking a little pale, Jordan.

35:42.431 --> 35:45.309
Do you wanna borrow
some of my makeup, Jordan?

35:46.394 --> 35:49.856
Uh, is that a streak in your hair?
It's so punk rock."

35:49.939 --> 35:51.315
And, I'll be honest,

35:51.649 --> 35:54.694
I was kind of dreaming of
cracking her head open.

35:57.864 --> 35:59.532
But I wasn't sure
there'd be a brain inside.

36:04.495 --> 36:07.290
My family is starving.
No lie.

36:11.294 --> 36:12.461
Lillywhite.

36:16.048 --> 36:17.592
Don't touch that. We'll talk.

36:21.679 --> 36:22.805
How's it coming along?

36:23.890 --> 36:26.309
Uh... It's a bit of a mixed bag.

36:26.392 --> 36:27.685
Any standouts?

36:29.061 --> 36:30.688
Standouts in what way?

36:30.771 --> 36:33.441
In that "I'd want this zombie
in a foxhole with me" way.

36:35.526 --> 36:36.569
Ah.

36:36.652 --> 36:38.738
So, that's what this is about.

36:38.821 --> 36:41.240
In case you missed it, Major,
we're hanging on by a very thin thread.

36:42.575 --> 36:44.577
We don't have enough trained
soldiers to control this city.

36:44.660 --> 36:45.828
These kids aren't trained.

36:45.953 --> 36:47.538
Then they'll have to learn on the job.

36:49.457 --> 36:51.334
So, who's in the foxhole with you? Captain Seattle. Jordan.

37:09.435 --> 37:10.686
Over here.

37:18.694 --> 37:19.862
Are you sure?

37:20.112 --> 37:22.782
Not really, sir.

37:26.118 --> 37:30.498
Jordan Gladwell, Fisher Webb,
this is Chase Graves.

37:31.457 --> 37:32.541
Big kahuna.

37:34.252 --> 37:35.127
Sir.

37:36.545 --> 37:39.257
I'd just asked Lillywhite here
who he thought had the right stuff

37:39.340 --> 37:40.883
to be a soldier at Fillmore-Graves.

37:42.176 --> 37:44.220
For whatever reason,
he sees something in the two of you.

37:47.223 --> 37:50.476
So, until you wash out,
get killed or usurp me,

37:50.559 --> 37:51.435
you'll be working for us.

37:52.979 --> 37:55.189
You'll be charged with keeping the peace
in this experimental city.

37:56.857 --> 37:57.942
Can I count on you?

37:58.567 --> 37:59.443
Yes, sir.

38:00.111 --> 38:01.153
Yes, sir.

38:01.279 --> 38:02.238
You'll be in Major's squad.

38:03.906 --> 38:06.075
Teach you everything you need to know
to survive out there.

38:07.243 --> 38:08.452
Don't screw up.

38:41.068 --> 38:45.614
Damned though you may be,
there is still a path to salvation.

38:46.324 --> 38:49.452
There is nothing that keeps the undead

38:49.535 --> 38:52.830
out of the pits of hell,
save for the mere pleasure of God.

38:57.001 --> 38:57.835
Never forget

38:58.961 --> 39:03.591
that God may cast a wicked zombie
into the pits of hell at any moment.

39:03.674 --> 39:06.886
Don't you mean "pits of well"?

39:08.888 --> 39:10.973
Because hell is a well.

39:12.308 --> 39:14.602
And, well, what,

39:15.603 --> 39:20.524
will one wicked, wanton, wonton,

39:20.608 --> 39:26.238
stuffed with balls of brains,
brined and braised harm the Almighty?

39:26.530 --> 39:27.698
Welcome, son.

39:27.782 --> 39:32.536
Welcome to the loving embrace of God.
Please, have a seat.

39:33.788 --> 39:36.040
Be ye man or be ye zombie?

39:37.291 --> 39:38.918
I am a vessel for the Lord.

39:39.168 --> 39:42.380
A human vessel or a zombie vessel?

39:42.922 --> 39:44.215
Human, of course.

39:45.674 --> 39:47.301
Zombies can't be ordained.

39:47.760 --> 39:51.389
Well, ain't that some squill?
So sayeth me, 'cause I speak to God.

39:51.472 --> 39:53.516
Of course. Prayer is important--

39:53.599 --> 39:55.309
And God speaks to me!

39:55.393 --> 39:58.938
I look in the light
and I hear his words.

39:59.146 --> 40:02.525
He says, "Angus, I need an army.

40:02.775 --> 40:04.276
Give me an army,

40:05.736 --> 40:10.199
and verily, we'll have them
by the short and curlies."

40:10.866 --> 40:13.828
Sir, what can we do for you?

40:13.911 --> 40:15.663
I'm hungry!

40:16.205 --> 40:19.542
Aren't you hungry?
Are you hungry

40:21.001 --> 40:24.505
Come closer, son.
We'll pray for a miracle.

40:32.888 --> 40:34.390
Dear Lord...

40:37.393 --> 40:38.894
No! No, no, no!

40:41.230 --> 40:43.983
Behold! A miracle!

40:55.077 --> 40:56.620
God loves you!

41:00.708 --> 41:02.042
He means it!

41:06.046 --> 41:07.131
Chow.

41:10.217 --> 41:11.844
Chow!
