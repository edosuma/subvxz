00:01.169 --> 00:03.131
<i>Previously on</i>
The Handmaid's Tale...

00:03.173 --> 00:06.012
<i>Luke, there are some things</i>
that I need to tell you.

00:06.095 --> 00:09.520
<i>I need you to know that</i>
Nichole was born out of love.

00:09.561 --> 00:11.524
She has no contact
with the baby.

00:11.565 --> 00:12.984
<i>And she pumps in her room.</i>

00:13.569 --> 00:16.366
<i>I will not let you</i>
grow up in this place.

00:16.407 --> 00:18.370
<i>I'm gonna get you out of here.</i>

00:18.370 --> 00:19.330
<i>What is happening?</i>

00:19.372 --> 00:21.292
I'm getting myself in deep shit.

00:21.334 --> 00:23.004
You're getting out of Gilead.

00:23.004 --> 00:23.923
Call her Nichole.

00:25.300 --> 00:26.302
June!

00:26.344 --> 00:27.514
Do you know Commander Mackenzie?

00:28.056 --> 00:28.975
<i>He has a daughter.</i>

00:29.392 --> 00:30.435
<i>Her name is Agnes.</i>

00:30.561 --> 00:32.607
I can't leave without her.

00:32.691 --> 00:35.738
Did you give my baby
to Ofjoseph?

00:36.030 --> 00:37.867
She's safe, Serena.

00:37.867 --> 00:39.453
‐Are you Luke?
‐Yeah.

00:39.705 --> 00:41.834
Your wife saved my life.

00:41.875 --> 00:43.086
We make this request

00:43.128 --> 00:44.463
<i>to the Canadian government.</i>

00:44.590 --> 00:46.384
<i>Our baby daughter</i>
was kidnapped.

00:46.384 --> 00:48.221
Nichole belongs in Gilead.

00:48.263 --> 00:49.600
So you're
a Commander now.

00:49.641 --> 00:51.729
You can go get Hannah.
You can get me out.

00:51.895 --> 00:52.772
I'm sorry.

00:52.856 --> 00:55.570
I'm getting deployed.
To the Front.

00:55.945 --> 00:56.864
<i>Chicago.</i>

00:56.947 --> 00:59.452
I think I care more about
your daughter than you do.

00:59.619 --> 01:03.084
I'm replenishing
the human race for her.

01:03.168 --> 01:05.757
‐What are you doing?
‐I am trying to be her mother!

01:05.798 --> 01:06.800
She has a mother.

01:06.884 --> 01:09.514
I would never have put you
in a new posting!

01:09.556 --> 01:11.351
<i>After what you pulled</i>
at the Mackenzies',

01:11.392 --> 01:12.729
<i>you should be on the wall.</i>

01:13.146 --> 01:16.110
You and I will finally be free
of one another.

01:16.152 --> 01:17.781
You will never be free of me

01:17.781 --> 01:20.035
until both of my children
are safe.

01:20.077 --> 01:22.957
We could have you on a plane
to Honolulu in an hour.

01:22.999 --> 01:24.878
You'd never have to go back
to Gilead again.

01:24.920 --> 01:26.089
Now, think of it.

01:26.130 --> 01:28.218
A baby of your own. And freedom.

01:28.218 --> 01:30.848
I met someone in Canada
who can help us.

01:31.307 --> 01:33.604
You just have to offer
your cooperation.

01:33.646 --> 01:34.606
<i>Commander Waterford,</i>

01:34.648 --> 01:35.942
you have now crossed
into Canada.

01:35.983 --> 01:39.156
You have been charged with
cruel and inhuman treatment,

01:39.198 --> 01:42.204
kidnapping, slavery and rape.

01:42.246 --> 01:44.709
‐What have you done?
‐I want to be with my daughter.

01:45.503 --> 01:47.549
It's always been about you.

01:47.590 --> 01:49.594
I have
some information to report.

01:49.636 --> 01:52.433
Serious crimes
committed by my wife.

01:52.600 --> 01:54.521
Under warrant from the ICC

01:54.563 --> 01:56.608
and the the government
of the United States of America,

01:56.650 --> 01:58.027
I'm placing you under arrest.

01:58.111 --> 01:59.906
Cheer up.
Fred and Serena are toast,

01:59.948 --> 02:01.451
<i>and you just got away</i>
with murder.

02:02.537 --> 02:05.375
I'll get you a truck.
You get my wife out safely.

02:05.668 --> 02:06.920
You can get out, too.

02:06.962 --> 02:09.885
You just have to bring them
something valuable. Kids.

02:10.385 --> 02:12.055
<i>I'm gonna get them out.</i>

02:12.055 --> 02:13.934
<i>They all deserve to be free.</i>

02:14.603 --> 02:16.272
Is this it? Mayday?

02:16.732 --> 02:17.609
Yes.

02:18.193 --> 02:19.236
They'll be coming for us.

02:22.242 --> 02:23.286
Get them on the plane.

02:24.121 --> 02:25.081
<i>Don't do this.</i>

02:34.099 --> 02:35.268
‐

02:42.992 --> 02:45.330
<i>We need to be ready</i>

02:46.499 --> 02:47.417
My God.

02:47.417 --> 02:48.712
<i>And the Lord said,</i>

04:01.942 --> 04:03.027
Hey, hey. I’m right here.

04:03.027 --> 04:03.946
We have to keep moving.

04:04.071 --> 04:06.200
I know. I know. June.

04:06.200 --> 04:07.369
‐Shh, shh.
‐

04:07.452 --> 04:08.496
Hey! Sorry!

04:08.789 --> 04:10.501
We are moving.
We are moving.

04:10.584 --> 04:11.962
We’ve already hooked up
with the Martha network.

04:12.045 --> 04:13.005
They’ve got a cool Guardian.

04:13.131 --> 04:14.174
If we can get to him,

04:14.174 --> 04:15.678
‐he can get us out of the city.
‐We have to.

04:15.678 --> 04:17.013
Okay? They're looking
for a safehouse.

04:17.013 --> 04:19.602
Okay. Listen to me.
We have to go West.

04:19.644 --> 04:20.688
Mayday is West.

04:20.730 --> 04:22.984
And we will. But right now
you’re losing a lot of blood.

04:23.443 --> 04:26.533
And we have to stop it
so you don’t die. Okay?

04:26.533 --> 04:27.910
‐Okay.
‐Okay.

04:29.121 --> 04:30.541
Okay. You ready?

04:30.583 --> 04:32.210
‐No. No. No.
‐Okay.

04:32.252 --> 04:33.630
Shh. It’s okay. It’s okay.

04:34.591 --> 04:35.718
Okay.

04:35.718 --> 04:37.471
Ready? Legs.

04:41.145 --> 04:42.230
Okay.

04:44.652 --> 04:46.238
Okay. I'm so sorry.

05:35.044 --> 05:36.631
‐

05:42.100 --> 05:43.562
Looks good. Looks good.

05:46.610 --> 05:48.196
Why don’t you
turn the engine off?

05:50.325 --> 05:51.912
‐

06:12.620 --> 06:14.749
You be good. Shh.

06:38.505 --> 06:40.466
You’re good. Go in grace.

07:49.647 --> 07:50.732
Blessed day.

07:52.485 --> 07:54.239
You look tired, Serena.

07:58.205 --> 07:59.207
Good morning.

08:00.168 --> 08:02.631
I'm afraid there's no smoking
in here, Mrs. Waterford.

08:05.596 --> 08:07.683
Are you gonna charge me
with smoking now?

08:18.872 --> 08:21.628
Well, gentlemen, I think that
you're both in the wrong place.

08:22.713 --> 08:24.842
I have a meeting here
with my lawyer.

08:24.842 --> 08:26.303
That meeting
is being rescheduled.

08:26.386 --> 08:27.973
Commander, your hearing
this afternoon

08:28.057 --> 08:29.852
will also need to be pushed,
I'm afraid.

08:29.852 --> 08:31.898
So, my rights are being
curtailed already?

08:32.106 --> 08:33.484
We appreciate your patience.

08:34.152 --> 08:36.699
I don't believe you've given
my wife and I much choice.

08:36.783 --> 08:38.118
Don't speak for me!

08:38.118 --> 08:39.454
Apologies...

08:41.333 --> 08:43.588
‐...Mrs. Waterford.
‐In any case,

08:44.089 --> 08:45.132
I will try to let you know

08:45.174 --> 08:46.678
if there are
any additional delays.

08:46.761 --> 08:49.015
And why would there be
any more delays...

08:50.686 --> 08:51.563
...Mark?

08:54.150 --> 08:55.946
Well, the news will break
in the next few hours,

08:55.946 --> 08:58.409
in any case.
Sooner, probably, with Twitter.

08:58.492 --> 09:01.541
Commander, Mrs. Waterford,
this morning,

09:01.541 --> 09:04.379
a plane left Gilead
and landed at Pearson.

09:05.298 --> 09:06.843
There were nine Marthas onboard.

09:07.886 --> 09:09.139
Apostates.

09:09.599 --> 09:12.563
Gilead is well rid of them,
I'm sure.

09:13.480 --> 09:15.109
There were also 86 children.

09:23.752 --> 09:26.716
I'm sorry,
did you say 86 children?

09:27.467 --> 09:28.469
Yes.

09:30.557 --> 09:32.477
We don't have much more
information right now.

09:32.561 --> 09:35.567
We just know that
they're here in Toronto

09:35.567 --> 09:36.694
and that they're safe.

09:38.907 --> 09:40.284
Their poor families.

09:40.284 --> 09:42.497
They're being reunited
with their families

09:42.497 --> 09:43.625
as we speak.

09:48.927 --> 09:50.346
This will start a war.

09:50.346 --> 09:52.518
We plan to do everything
we can to avoid that.

09:52.601 --> 09:53.937
But right now, our priority

09:53.937 --> 09:55.899
is the well‐being
of the children.

09:55.899 --> 09:59.197
Then you return them home,
as quickly as possible.

10:00.701 --> 10:02.286
I'd like nothing better.

10:03.748 --> 10:05.167
But their homes are gone.

10:06.713 --> 10:07.840
You destroyed them.

10:15.605 --> 10:17.108
They can go back
to their cells now.

10:17.150 --> 10:18.277
Mr. Tuello, do you know

10:18.318 --> 10:19.905
how the Marthas
got the children out?

10:19.905 --> 10:22.118
We're still receiving details,

10:23.412 --> 10:25.667
but we believe that
there was a Handmaid involved.

10:26.711 --> 10:27.963
Yours.

10:28.840 --> 10:30.176
June Osborn.

10:34.935 --> 10:37.064
She's still in Gilead,

10:37.064 --> 10:39.737
and as far as we know,
still at large.

10:40.530 --> 10:42.283
I'll have your appointments
rescheduled

10:42.283 --> 10:43.703
‐as soon as possible.
‐

10:48.963 --> 10:50.216
Offred.

10:51.719 --> 10:53.013
They're gonna find her.

10:56.562 --> 10:57.898
And they're gonna kill her.

11:02.699 --> 11:04.327
May God show her mercy.

11:34.513 --> 11:35.640
I don't see the lantern.

11:37.143 --> 11:38.980
How are we supposed
to see the lantern?

11:39.773 --> 11:42.320
‐I'll get closer.
‐You can barely walk.

11:45.492 --> 11:47.748
‐I'm not sending someone else.
‐June!

12:55.842 --> 12:57.011
Blessed evening.

12:59.474 --> 13:01.687
And to you, sir.

13:03.566 --> 13:04.651
You're from Boston?

13:06.822 --> 13:08.785
‐
‐Yeah.

13:09.995 --> 13:11.624
They said
there were more of you.

13:14.045 --> 13:15.214
Where are the others?

13:36.214 --> 13:37.216
Are they okay?

13:44.438 --> 13:45.567
Are you okay?

13:50.409 --> 13:51.369
You're safe.

14:17.046 --> 14:18.381
‐David?
‐Yes, ma'am.

14:18.381 --> 14:20.385
Please unlock the west
gate and wait for Martha.

14:20.385 --> 14:21.722
Bring her to the house
as soon as she gets here.

14:21.764 --> 14:23.224
‐Yes, ma'am. Here, take her.
‐Here's a...

14:23.224 --> 14:24.226
We have to keep her warm.

14:24.268 --> 14:25.437
The Martha was a nurse before.

14:25.437 --> 14:26.481
Here.

14:26.941 --> 14:27.984
Careful. God, June.

14:27.984 --> 14:29.445
‐Get her down.
‐Lift her head.

14:29.445 --> 14:31.617
‐
‐Oh, it's okay. Okay.

14:32.869 --> 14:34.372
‐You're okay, June.
‐I'm Mrs. Keyes.

14:34.372 --> 14:35.625
Esther.

14:36.459 --> 14:38.004
‐June.
‐I know.

14:38.589 --> 14:39.465
Thank you.

14:39.465 --> 14:41.094
You're the one
I've been waiting for.

14:41.469 --> 14:43.306
You got
those children out, dear.

14:45.477 --> 14:46.814
He sent me dreams of you.

14:48.734 --> 14:50.655
We were killing people together.

14:53.243 --> 14:55.038
It was the most
wonderful dreams.

14:56.834 --> 14:58.921
It's okay, it's okay.

14:59.380 --> 15:01.217
Just rest, get better.

15:09.275 --> 15:10.318
Okay.

15:18.794 --> 15:19.880
Aunt Lydia,

15:20.380 --> 15:24.514
you've spent two weeks
being interviewed by the Eyes.

15:28.480 --> 15:29.816
Nineteen days.

15:32.362 --> 15:34.325
The interview, Commander.

15:35.160 --> 15:37.331
It was a bit more
than two weeks.

15:38.333 --> 15:39.335
Yes.

15:39.669 --> 15:41.422
Pray. Excuse my error.

15:42.759 --> 15:46.099
This Council has concluded that
you will not be the subject

15:46.140 --> 15:48.353
of further discipline
in this matter.

15:49.063 --> 15:49.898
Thank you.

15:49.940 --> 15:51.275
This is not an exoneration.

15:52.152 --> 15:54.908
Those children were taken
by females under your charge.

15:55.785 --> 15:56.787
Yes, sir.

15:57.580 --> 15:59.626
I am humbled by your mercy.

16:00.043 --> 16:01.922
Your frailties
were also considered.

16:10.648 --> 16:12.234
How empathetic of you, sir.

16:13.361 --> 16:16.492
So spoken,
so rendered, by this committee.

16:16.492 --> 16:18.873
Return to your good works,
Aunt Lydia.

16:18.873 --> 16:20.041
Thank you.

16:22.462 --> 16:25.678
Handmaids. Sinful whores.

16:26.513 --> 16:27.974
More trouble than they're worth.

16:37.075 --> 16:38.203
Yes, sir.

16:40.081 --> 16:42.795
More misled than sinful,
in this case.

16:44.925 --> 16:46.344
We appreciate your insights.

16:46.427 --> 16:50.185
They were led astray
by a gifted and amoral liar.

16:50.770 --> 16:51.855
A Delilah.

16:52.941 --> 16:55.821
When she is hanging on the wall,

16:55.821 --> 16:57.324
justice will be done.

16:57.992 --> 16:59.245
Ofjoseph.

16:59.495 --> 17:03.336
She has eluded your soldiers
for 19 days.

17:04.046 --> 17:06.050
She's out there planning

17:06.092 --> 17:08.429
who knows
what kind of atrocities

17:08.639 --> 17:11.895
to visit upon
our righteous nation.

17:13.565 --> 17:15.402
Pray, gentlemen,

17:17.155 --> 17:18.408
find her

17:19.703 --> 17:21.122
and bring her to me.

17:24.838 --> 17:27.552
And a frail woman
will sleep better at night.

17:30.725 --> 17:32.645
I leave you to your work.

17:35.483 --> 17:36.528
Most blessed day.

17:50.347 --> 17:52.644
‐

18:18.486 --> 18:20.741
<i>I used to think</i>
of my body as an instrument

18:20.825 --> 18:22.578
<i>for the accomplishment</i>
of my will.

18:23.872 --> 18:25.417
<i>I could use it to run,</i>

18:25.417 --> 18:28.005
<i>pick things up,</i>
make things happen.

18:29.383 --> 18:31.220
<i>There were limits, of course,</i>

18:31.220 --> 18:33.391
<i>but my body was nonetheless</i>
one with me.

18:34.811 --> 18:36.272
<i>It obeyed my commands,</i>

18:37.065 --> 18:38.569
<i>mostly without complaint.</i>

18:40.113 --> 18:41.407
<i>Not anymore.</i>

18:43.537 --> 18:45.206
<i>Now there's tending to be done.</i>

18:46.585 --> 18:48.589
<i>There's homemade penicillin.</i>

18:48.630 --> 18:50.383
<i>Mold scraped off,</i>
rotten fruit,

18:51.928 --> 18:53.264
<i>an old Martha recipe.</i>

18:58.859 --> 19:00.946
<i>There's comfrey</i>
and marigold oil

19:01.071 --> 19:03.034
<i>to make the skin heal faster.</i>

19:03.994 --> 19:05.455
<i>Almost bikini season.</i>

19:08.211 --> 19:10.883
<i>I almost died when we first</i>
got here, they said.

19:10.883 --> 19:12.177
‐
‐Sepsis.

19:12.929 --> 19:14.974
<i>Janine says</i>
I was talking to Hannah.

19:15.643 --> 19:17.395
‐
‐I don't remember.

19:24.409 --> 19:26.288
<i>Pain makes your world</i>
very small.

19:27.625 --> 19:29.253
<i>My world has been this room.</i>

19:33.177 --> 19:34.722
<i>Today I venture forth.</i>

19:49.251 --> 19:50.796
<i>My world can't be small,</i>

19:52.299 --> 19:53.635
<i>Not now.</i>

19:54.512 --> 19:56.766
<i>Because the others need me</i>
to protect them.

20:00.733 --> 20:02.235
<i>Gilead is out there.</i>

20:03.614 --> 20:04.949
<i>Gilead isn't afraid.</i>

20:06.118 --> 20:08.414
<i>It does not hurt or sleep.</i>

20:10.586 --> 20:14.301
<i>It keeps coming,</i>
it keeps searching for us.

20:15.596 --> 20:21.106
<i>And they will keep coming</i>
forever and ever and ever.

20:23.820 --> 20:25.532
<i>No more time</i>
for me to stay in bed.

20:29.874 --> 20:32.630
June. You're up!

20:33.757 --> 20:35.093
Let's get that up.

20:40.228 --> 20:41.146
Hold there.

20:43.568 --> 20:45.698
Come on, buddy. Wait up!

20:46.825 --> 20:47.785
Hi!

20:48.285 --> 20:50.456
‐
‐Mr. Darcy, say hi to June.

20:51.710 --> 20:54.716
Oh, Mr. Darcy. For fuck's sake.

20:59.099 --> 21:00.519
Look at that!

21:24.859 --> 21:26.654
‐Hey!
‐Hey.

21:26.696 --> 21:28.449
Holy crap, it lives.

21:30.119 --> 21:34.044
Look at you, out of bed.
Actually dressed.

21:36.131 --> 21:37.676
Look at me.

21:38.720 --> 21:40.682
How far can you see
on a clear day?

21:41.433 --> 21:43.104
Five, six miles, I'd guess?

21:43.814 --> 21:45.943
The road is the edge
of the farm, see?

21:46.026 --> 21:48.364
And then after that,
enemy territory.

21:48.907 --> 21:49.909
Yeah.

21:55.796 --> 21:57.758
How are you feeling, for real?

21:57.758 --> 22:00.263
It's like shit.

22:01.181 --> 22:02.518
This thing's a mess.

22:03.687 --> 22:04.814
It hurts like balls,

22:04.814 --> 22:07.945
and it's oozing some kind of
like a mustardy, like, yellow...

22:07.945 --> 22:09.782
I don't know,
like a pus or something.

22:14.207 --> 22:15.544
Other than that, I'm great.

22:17.631 --> 22:19.594
‐That's awesome.
‐Thank you.

22:19.760 --> 22:21.054
I'm so glad you're back.

22:21.681 --> 22:22.766
Thanks.

23:22.636 --> 23:24.515
Blessed day, Commander Keyes.

23:58.499 --> 24:01.463
Blessed be the fruit!
You're out of bed.

24:03.342 --> 24:04.469
Sorry.

24:05.388 --> 24:06.682
Yeah. May the Lord open.

24:07.433 --> 24:08.520
You're outside.

24:09.104 --> 24:10.398
Praise be.

24:10.398 --> 24:12.193
Thank you for taking
such good care of me.

24:12.193 --> 24:15.032
I thought you were gonna die.

24:15.951 --> 24:17.579
‐I really did.
‐

24:17.704 --> 24:18.832
But you're not.

24:19.542 --> 24:20.752
You're better.

24:23.633 --> 24:24.927
What are we gonna do?

24:26.304 --> 24:27.056
Hmm?

24:27.766 --> 24:30.689
Um, if there were drones,
would we even see them?

24:33.778 --> 24:35.991
No. They'd be way too high.

24:35.991 --> 24:36.993
Here.

24:37.703 --> 24:39.122
No, but they'd see us.

24:40.166 --> 24:41.460
They'd see all of you.

24:41.836 --> 24:43.590
There's Marthas working
on all the farms

24:43.673 --> 24:44.633
‐around here.
‐I know that.

24:47.138 --> 24:48.265
Good.

24:51.480 --> 24:52.858
I'm not worried at all.

24:54.319 --> 24:57.618
You're here. June is here.

25:06.259 --> 25:08.055
I want to hurt them so badly.

25:10.184 --> 25:11.521
Gilead,

25:12.731 --> 25:13.900
the men.

25:15.946 --> 25:17.073
What can we do?

25:17.073 --> 25:18.910
It's not safe right now.

25:18.952 --> 25:20.496
They're looking for us

25:20.664 --> 25:22.918
and we can't be moving around
outside the farm.

25:22.960 --> 25:24.588
Yeah,

25:25.715 --> 25:26.759
but you're Mayday.

25:28.303 --> 25:29.389
We do things.

25:30.474 --> 25:31.769
We will.

25:33.523 --> 25:35.067
You're not in bed anymore.

25:36.862 --> 25:37.781
So?

25:40.996 --> 25:42.666
Mrs. Keyes, it's...

25:46.339 --> 25:48.218
God, it's not fair.

25:49.304 --> 25:52.728
Someone your age should
never need to be this brave.

26:02.623 --> 26:04.668
I'm the mistress of this house.

26:06.463 --> 26:08.008
Yes, you are.

26:10.054 --> 26:11.264
Ma'am.

26:13.352 --> 26:14.312
And if you weren't
going to fight,

26:14.354 --> 26:15.565
then why did you come here?

26:17.819 --> 26:19.531
You should have just
let them catch you.

26:43.078 --> 26:44.288
Blessed day, Commander.

26:44.497 --> 26:45.917
Not from where I sit.

26:47.879 --> 26:50.008
What news do you bring me,
Commander Blaine?

26:50.134 --> 26:52.346
No news I can share,
unfortunately.

26:53.306 --> 26:55.895
I'm here to thank you
for your service to Gilead.

27:02.951 --> 27:04.997
The thanks of a grateful nation.

27:05.456 --> 27:06.751
Yes, sir. It's well deserved.

27:06.792 --> 27:08.211
Well deserved.

27:08.963 --> 27:10.759
Was there a trial?

27:11.719 --> 27:13.054
Yes, sir.

27:13.054 --> 27:14.933
How did I do?

27:18.900 --> 27:20.862
I'm here to thank you
for your service to Gilead.

27:21.404 --> 27:22.616
That good, huh?

27:35.098 --> 27:36.852
You'll receive more information
tomorrow, sir.

27:37.604 --> 27:38.731
Tomorrow.

27:40.275 --> 27:41.361
Yes, sir.

27:42.781 --> 27:43.783
Under His eye.

27:45.327 --> 27:47.248
How go the invasion plans?

27:49.126 --> 27:50.547
I've received no such orders.

27:50.672 --> 27:51.882
Well, they're coming.

27:53.511 --> 27:56.099
Do you think it's a good idea
to invade Canada?

27:57.811 --> 27:58.688
It's not my decision.

27:58.688 --> 28:00.357
Yet you may die.

28:02.486 --> 28:04.658
Millions may die
by that decision.

28:07.581 --> 28:10.043
Gilead is determined to bring
the missing children home.

28:10.043 --> 28:11.170
At any cost?

28:12.423 --> 28:13.676
I believe so.

28:14.135 --> 28:15.888
‐No.
‐No?

28:16.264 --> 28:18.351
This is a diplomatic
opportunity.

28:20.607 --> 28:23.028
If Gilead can
let those children go,

28:23.028 --> 28:24.531
as a sign of good faith,

28:25.324 --> 28:28.623
think of the bilateral progress
that could be made.

28:28.623 --> 28:31.044
A cease fire at the border,
trade talks.

28:31.044 --> 28:32.714
Might be able
to kickstart the UN.

28:35.469 --> 28:37.431
What happens
in the next few weeks

28:37.473 --> 28:39.101
will dictate
the future of this country.

28:43.193 --> 28:44.655
It's June's legacy.

28:47.911 --> 28:49.288
What do you want it to say?

28:58.348 --> 29:00.520
I'm here to thank you
for your service to Gilead.

29:05.863 --> 29:07.157
You're a good man, Commander.

29:10.998 --> 29:11.834
Guard.

29:21.854 --> 29:23.106
Come on.

29:26.780 --> 29:28.659
‐June.
‐

29:37.719 --> 29:39.138
Hi, Mr. Darcy.

29:39.765 --> 29:40.767
Hi, buddy.

29:41.935 --> 29:44.023
‐You're a good, good pig.
‐

29:45.818 --> 29:47.321
It's not your fault, okay?

29:49.868 --> 29:51.078
Janine?

29:57.842 --> 29:59.261
Dear Lord,

29:59.805 --> 30:01.474
let us know your miracles,

30:02.017 --> 30:03.854
and let us be in awe of them.

30:05.440 --> 30:08.321
Your world sustains us,
body and soul.

30:08.864 --> 30:10.576
May we be truly worthy.

30:11.995 --> 30:13.122
Amen.

30:14.083 --> 30:16.170
‐Amen.
‐

30:24.228 --> 30:25.272
That was beautiful.

30:25.272 --> 30:27.150
‐It was okay?
‐Yeah, it was lovely.

30:28.529 --> 30:29.573
Thank you.

30:40.928 --> 30:42.515
‐

31:00.968 --> 31:02.722
I do.
I really love the parsnip.

31:03.181 --> 31:04.851
Which one's the parsnip?
This one?

31:04.851 --> 31:05.853
The purple one?

31:05.853 --> 31:07.064
I think
the white one.

31:07.064 --> 31:08.066
The white one, yeah.

31:08.692 --> 31:10.529
Do you want to take one?

31:13.326 --> 31:14.871
‐Do you want?
‐No.

31:14.871 --> 31:17.417
‐Can you just pass them?
‐Mmm‐hmm.

31:21.551 --> 31:23.346
‐Oh, I'll take it.
‐There you go.

31:23.847 --> 31:25.058
Take one, Janine.

31:27.187 --> 31:31.487
Oh. No. Thank you, ma'am.

31:34.744 --> 31:36.623
I had to kill that pig
to feed you all.

31:38.752 --> 31:40.881
She'd still be alive
if you weren't here.

31:44.138 --> 31:45.265
So...

31:56.203 --> 31:58.291
Life is precious
on a farm, Janine.

32:15.116 --> 32:16.828
Don’t spit that out!

32:23.007 --> 32:24.051
Mrs. Keyes.

32:34.279 --> 32:35.281
‐

32:38.079 --> 32:39.081
Hey.

32:42.170 --> 32:43.966
I do not want you
messing with Janine.

32:44.424 --> 32:45.553
Do you understand me?

32:46.262 --> 32:48.266
‐Give me that knife.
‐It's mine.

32:48.851 --> 32:51.021
‐Give it to me.
‐Food is a gift from God.

32:51.021 --> 32:52.984
In my house,
we clean our plates.

32:54.069 --> 32:55.071
Isn't this my house?

32:55.155 --> 32:56.867
They took out
her fucking eye! Okay?

32:56.867 --> 32:57.910
They brutalized her.

32:57.994 --> 32:59.496
They brutalized
all of those women.

32:59.998 --> 33:01.793
You know what they do
to Handmaids, don't you?

33:02.795 --> 33:03.839
Yeah?

33:03.964 --> 33:05.300
Then show some compassion.

33:05.801 --> 33:07.220
And some fucking respect.

33:09.559 --> 33:11.145
The Commander couldn't do it.

33:12.105 --> 33:14.151
‐Excuse me?
‐Couldn't do it,

33:14.652 --> 33:16.907
most of the time
whenever we first married.

33:18.034 --> 33:21.207
With the pills,
needle shot into his thing.

33:22.877 --> 33:25.465
He wanted a baby... Of course.

33:27.887 --> 33:28.805
What...

33:32.855 --> 33:34.149
What did he do to you?

33:37.990 --> 33:41.080
He would bring in other men.

33:43.334 --> 33:47.133
You know, Guardians. Eyes.

33:48.344 --> 33:50.098
Even some Commanders.

34:08.719 --> 34:10.723
Then they started
coming more often.

34:12.977 --> 34:14.689
For their turn to fuck me.

34:49.132 --> 34:50.511
I'm sorry.

34:54.769 --> 34:56.898
Wives have bad things, too.

34:59.821 --> 35:00.864
Yeah.

35:02.283 --> 35:03.662
Yeah, I know.

35:08.755 --> 35:09.757
Hey.

35:12.429 --> 35:13.431
Hey.

35:17.940 --> 35:19.819
Now you listen to me, okay?

35:22.825 --> 35:24.579
None of this is your fault.

35:27.292 --> 35:28.169
None of it.

35:40.276 --> 35:41.571
You know what I think?

35:46.079 --> 35:47.666
I think God...

35:48.877 --> 35:50.213
is just.

35:55.849 --> 35:57.352
And I think

35:57.770 --> 36:00.274
that He is gonna
make those men pay.

36:03.364 --> 36:04.534
Uh‐huh.

36:07.247 --> 36:08.917
For what they did to you.

36:35.177 --> 36:36.848
Shh. It's okay.

36:38.309 --> 36:39.311
Shh.

36:41.023 --> 36:42.317
It's all right.

36:47.243 --> 36:48.245
It's okay.

37:08.703 --> 37:09.705
Alma?

37:13.713 --> 37:14.882
June.

37:19.432 --> 37:21.854
Where the fuck were you?
She needed to be managed.

37:21.938 --> 37:23.399
‐Who?
‐Mrs. Keyes.

37:23.482 --> 37:24.234
Wait...

37:24.317 --> 37:26.405
That abused little girl
is the only thing protecting us.

37:26.488 --> 37:27.783
‐Where were you?
‐That was my job?

37:27.866 --> 37:29.327
Yes! Yes!

37:29.745 --> 37:31.373
I was tryin' to keep you alive.

37:31.456 --> 37:33.545
After carrying your fat ass
across friggin' Massachusetts.

37:33.628 --> 37:34.964
You're fucking welcome.

37:41.853 --> 37:43.022
Where's Janine?

37:43.857 --> 37:45.861
I don't know. Reading a book.

37:45.944 --> 37:47.405
Getting laid, I hope.

37:47.488 --> 37:48.950
Enjoying her freedom.

37:51.455 --> 37:52.624
Alma.

37:53.208 --> 37:54.754
We are not free.

37:55.672 --> 37:58.052
Maybe this is as free
as we're gonna get.

37:58.135 --> 37:59.764
Maybe we should make
the best of it.

Commander Lawrence.

40:49.645 --> 40:52.024
You've already thanked me
for my service.

40:53.820 --> 40:56.032
I think there still
may be more that you can do.

40:57.076 --> 40:58.245
For your country.

40:58.538 --> 41:02.128
This is an overview of force
strength along the border.

41:02.378 --> 41:04.132

with commentary.

41:05.175 --> 41:06.762
You'll know
where everyone stands.

41:07.848 --> 41:10.477
I convinced the Council
to bring you in as a consultant.

41:14.193 --> 41:15.572
They'll listen to you.

41:18.536 --> 41:19.955
Some men need to be led.

41:21.249 --> 41:23.462
The Tao of June Osborn.

41:25.466 --> 41:26.760
Blessed day, Commander.

41:28.848 --> 41:30.350
I'll let you get cleaned up.

41:32.647 --> 41:34.400
‐Blessed morning, sir.
‐Mmm.

41:35.904 --> 41:38.366
Blessed be the fruit.

41:42.416 --> 41:43.878
A full shave today, sir?

41:44.378 --> 41:47.844
You can trim my beard
but not too much.

41:47.928 --> 41:49.973
I'm enjoying the length.

41:55.359 --> 41:56.486
Mrs. Keyes?

42:00.035 --> 42:01.162
Esther?

42:36.149 --> 42:37.652
Blessed day.

42:40.575 --> 42:42.494
‐
‐Blessed day.

42:49.801 --> 42:51.387
I'm sorry, I, um...

42:53.016 --> 42:54.770
I don't recall your name.

42:55.813 --> 42:57.901
I'm Rob Keyes.

42:59.821 --> 43:01.449
Um, Martha.

43:03.913 --> 43:05.499
‐Sir.
‐Martha.

43:08.547 --> 43:11.010
Glory be, Martha.

43:11.720 --> 43:13.098
Thank you.

43:13.431 --> 43:14.518
Uh‐huh.

43:14.810 --> 43:16.145
There's another...

43:17.691 --> 43:20.487
young lady living
at the house. I...

43:22.742 --> 43:24.871
I don't recall her name, either.

43:28.921 --> 43:31.342
‐Her name is Esther.
‐Esther.

43:33.889 --> 43:34.891
Esther.

43:38.858 --> 43:40.570
Such a pretty girl.

44:12.090 --> 44:14.053
I'm a bit afraid of her.

44:15.807 --> 44:17.100
At times.

44:19.104 --> 44:20.190
To be honest.

44:31.505 --> 44:32.757
You should be.

44:43.319 --> 44:45.031
Blessed day, Commander.

44:46.910 --> 44:48.288
We need you outside.

44:54.174 --> 44:55.176
Stay with him.

45:38.262 --> 45:39.473
He was trespassing.

45:41.310 --> 45:42.312
He was drunk.

45:43.064 --> 45:45.528
I can have him arrested,
in the name of my husband.

45:46.822 --> 45:48.116
Do we know his name?

45:48.659 --> 45:49.995
Guardian Pogue.

45:51.205 --> 45:52.416
He likes "Johnny" better.

45:53.251 --> 45:54.796
He likes hearing me say it.

45:56.048 --> 45:58.512
He likes the way my tongue looks
whenever I say it.

46:09.993 --> 46:10.828
Bring him up.

46:15.880 --> 46:17.508
Is he one of them?

46:27.235 --> 46:28.906
Blessed be the fruit, Johnny.

46:33.122 --> 46:34.124
Shit.

46:46.315 --> 46:47.610
‐

46:48.194 --> 46:49.196
Hey!

47:04.853 --> 47:05.938
Stop.

47:11.992 --> 47:13.327
Put him in the barn.

47:22.095 --> 47:23.389
He saw all of us.

47:25.393 --> 47:26.521
Yeah, he did.

47:26.813 --> 47:28.149
I'm sorry.

47:29.569 --> 47:30.571
Shit.

47:32.575 --> 47:34.411
I needed
to pay attention to her.

47:35.915 --> 47:37.250
It's not your fault.

47:41.467 --> 47:43.429
Her family sent her here.

47:46.352 --> 47:47.730
To be raped.

47:51.362 --> 47:52.823
And passed around.

47:55.161 --> 47:59.044
They gave her to these... men.

48:03.094 --> 48:05.098
So, no, it's not your fault.

48:08.271 --> 48:09.983
We'll take him to the river.

48:10.066 --> 48:11.110
Deal with him.

48:13.532 --> 48:14.534
No.

48:52.526 --> 48:53.528
Girls.

48:56.241 --> 48:58.622
This man betrayed
his own country,

48:59.707 --> 49:00.918
the United States.

49:04.132 --> 49:05.468
He's a traitor.

49:09.811 --> 49:11.313
And this man...

49:14.612 --> 49:16.073
raped a child.

49:18.995 --> 49:20.331
Repeatedly.

49:21.960 --> 49:24.047
The punishment
for these crimes...

49:29.684 --> 49:30.686
is death.

50:15.233 --> 50:16.778
You were right.

50:19.784 --> 50:20.869
You were right.

50:22.915 --> 50:24.000
We're Mayday.

50:25.546 --> 50:27.131
We don't hide.

50:30.137 --> 50:31.139
We fight.

50:38.613 --> 50:40.157
And in this place,

50:43.832 --> 50:45.084
we all fight.

50:56.524 --> 50:57.610
Good girl.

51:02.243 --> 51:03.788
Make me proud.

51:05.207 --> 51:06.335
I will.

kill a bunch a commanders?

56:07.687 --> 56:08.522
Both.

56:09.608 --> 56:13.365
Better to die on your feet than
to live on your knees. Right?

56:15.202 --> 56:19.085
You can't save her.
She is never coming back to you.

56:19.711 --> 56:21.882
You owe me.
This could help you stay alive.

56:22.049 --> 56:24.638
Everyone that helps her
end up on the fucking wall.

56:25.097 --> 56:28.228
I have witnesses
to your many abuses, Commander.

56:28.311 --> 56:29.397
What else you got?

56:29.480 --> 56:31.275
You want me to restore
your position?

56:31.359 --> 56:33.113
I need my seat back
at the table.

56:33.572 --> 56:36.369

56:42.674 --> 56:44.343
Please, I just want
my daughter back.

56:44.427 --> 56:46.472
If you think I'm gonna
let you have her,

56:46.557 --> 56:47.851
then you are delusional.

<i>Kid misses Gilead.</i>

56:53.988 --> 56:56.451

56:56.577 --> 56:57.829
June didn't think
that part through.

56:57.912 --> 56:58.998
That's what she does.

57:00.125 --> 57:02.296
<i>This is stupid</i>
and dangerous.

57:02.672 --> 57:04.676
We're going

57:05.135 --> 57:07.640
<i>You will be tested</i>
by wicked men.

57:07.891 --> 57:09.310
What kind of resistance are you?

57:09.477 --> 57:10.395
The kind that survives.

57:11.314 --> 57:13.694
Your bond with each other
will be strong.

57:16.533 --> 57:19.581
<i>From this day forward,</i>
none of you

57:19.664 --> 57:23.421
