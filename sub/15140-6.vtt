00:00.209 --> 00:02.294
[Mac] Previously on
Commander in Chief:

00:02.377 --> 00:05.172
[man] Mr. Speaker,
the president of the United States!

00:05.255 --> 00:08.091
[Rod] You have a country
full of people who believe in you.

00:08.175 --> 00:12.304
If one bomb goes off tomorrow,
I'm gonna put this all on her shoulders.

00:12.387 --> 00:14.848
No one's noticed Mom's
the first female president.

00:14.932 --> 00:17.392
They're busy laughing
at her wuss of a husband.

00:17.476 --> 00:19.269
I guess being a wuss runs in the family.

00:19.438 --> 00:21.897
If I'm not a part of this,
what am I doing?

00:21.980 --> 00:24.483
We want you to be the next
commissioner of baseball.

00:24.566 --> 00:27.194
No first person's ever
worked outside the White House.

00:27.277 --> 00:29.988
I mean, there's no
legal reason I can't take that job.

00:30.071 --> 00:31.440
You might be happier.

00:32.157 --> 00:33.158
[door opening]

00:34.451 --> 00:36.537
Madam President,
it's an honor to meet you.

00:36.620 --> 00:38.956
It'd be if you weren't
in my daughter's bedroom.

00:39.039 --> 00:42.459
[Nathan] You understand
the burdens of the necessary evil.

00:42.543 --> 00:44.962
I didn't think that
was part of your make-up.

00:45.629 --> 00:47.214
[engine rumbling]

00:47.297 --> 00:50.175
[woman] OK, so, what's first
on the president's agenda?

00:50.309 --> 00:53.428
She and the speaker will be met
by Governor Nuñez soon as we land.

00:53.536 --> 00:56.598
The president intends to get
a look at the effects of the hurricane,

00:56.682 --> 00:59.893
meet with the people of Florida,
see how to be of service.

00:59.977 --> 01:01.728
[woman] What's the president doing?

01:01.812 --> 01:04.234
She and the speaker
are going over their itinerary...

01:04.356 --> 01:07.150
What about your boss
forming an exploratory committee?

01:07.284 --> 01:09.528
Nobody's talking
politics right now, guys.

01:10.445 --> 01:13.156
In the 36 years I've spent in Congress,

01:13.264 --> 01:18.537
I've made this trip...
Oh, wow, so many times.

01:18.667 --> 01:21.623
- Do you still have family?
- Yeah, a couple of cousins.

01:21.707 --> 01:25.127
- Nieces and nephews.
- Must make it that much harder.

01:25.210 --> 01:28.505
This is terrific.
Really, this is terrific.

01:28.622 --> 01:30.841
I love that quote from Jeremiah.

01:31.024 --> 01:35.095
"'I know the plans I have for you,'
declares the Lord.

01:35.178 --> 01:38.307
'Plans to give you hope.
Hope and a future.'"

01:38.439 --> 01:41.018
[Nathan yawns]
My goodness. Excuse me.

01:41.200 --> 01:42.978
If you don't mind, ma'am,

01:43.061 --> 01:47.941
I think I'll, uh, go back
and catch 40 winks before we land.

01:48.066 --> 01:49.735
Would you like to use my cabin?

01:49.868 --> 01:52.404
Thank you, ma'am. No.
I'm very cozy in my seat.

01:52.562 --> 01:54.906
Nathan, I'm...
I'm sorry about your family home.

01:55.040 --> 01:56.458
Oh, dear.

01:58.160 --> 01:59.747
It.. It was a Craftsman.

02:00.197 --> 02:03.040
My grandfather built it in 1910.

02:03.122 --> 02:05.250
Spent every dime he had on it.

02:05.342 --> 02:08.462
It had weathered
the fiercest of hurricanes.

02:08.545 --> 02:11.423
This was just a little one,
by our standards,

02:11.548 --> 02:13.675
but I guess it was our turn.

02:15.052 --> 02:19.556
Yeah. Nathan, I'm sorry
about the circumstances,

02:19.640 --> 02:22.184
but I'm glad we're doing this.
Good to work together.

02:22.267 --> 02:24.561
Sarah says where there's a will,
there's a way.

02:24.645 --> 02:27.105
And we had the will.
It was my pleasure, ma'am.

02:27.189 --> 02:28.398
[knocking on door]

02:29.775 --> 02:31.485
Sorry to interrupt, ma'am. Sir.

02:31.568 --> 02:33.820
Advance recommends we divert to Tampa.

02:33.904 --> 02:35.739
- Why?
- Power's out in Jacksonville.

02:35.822 --> 02:37.115
Access points blocked...

02:37.199 --> 02:39.409
I need to get there.
We need to get to the site.

02:39.534 --> 02:41.536
- Stay the course, Vince.
- Yes, ma'am.

02:41.703 --> 02:43.955
[chuckling]

02:44.039 --> 02:46.291
No matter what else
they say about you, ma'am,

02:46.375 --> 02:48.794
for sure you're not
a shrinking violet, are you?

02:48.877 --> 02:51.004
What else do they say about me?

02:51.088 --> 02:53.423
- You guys started early.
- Oh, sad but true.

02:53.507 --> 02:55.592
- No school today?
- Uh, yeah, yeah. In a few.

02:55.676 --> 02:58.261
I was thinking of running
for senior class president.

02:58.345 --> 03:00.055
I know it's not what you do anymore,

03:00.138 --> 03:02.349
but I wondered
if you'd help me with a speech.

03:02.432 --> 03:04.976
Wow. You're just a junior.
Planning ahead.

03:05.060 --> 03:07.229
- Um, yeah. Sure.
- OK.

03:07.312 --> 03:09.439
- [Rod] Horace!
- Mr. Calloway.

03:09.523 --> 03:11.358
Hey, Kelly. Your sisters are waiting.

03:11.441 --> 03:12.693
- Come on.
- OK.

03:12.776 --> 03:14.486
- See you later.
- [Kelly] Bye.

03:15.654 --> 03:18.156
So, you stayed around
to manage the trade agreement?

03:18.240 --> 03:21.660
Yeah, and the VP confirmation,
and the president's tax relief bill...

03:21.743 --> 03:24.705
You heard anything about
the baseball commissioner job?

03:24.788 --> 03:26.957
- Through the rumor mill?
- You mean about you?

03:27.040 --> 03:28.375
- [Rod] Mm-hm.
- No. Why?

03:28.458 --> 03:31.461
- It shouldn't be discussed.
- So, you're still considering it?

03:31.545 --> 03:33.797
I'm meeting
with some owners at Camden Yards.

03:33.880 --> 03:35.507
So, uh, guess I am.

03:41.638 --> 03:44.057
- You have a gun, don't you?
- Uh-huh.

03:44.141 --> 03:46.143
- Could I see it?
- Amy.

03:46.226 --> 03:47.894
- Stop bugging her, OK?
- She's not.

03:47.978 --> 03:49.896
Well, she's bugging me.

03:49.980 --> 03:52.149
Joan, so you know,
I'm not going to practice.

03:52.232 --> 03:53.900
- All right.
- Wait. What?

03:53.984 --> 03:55.193
You wanna hang with Mike,

03:55.277 --> 03:57.320
- do it on your own time.
- Becca loves Mike.

03:57.404 --> 03:59.406
- Shut up.
- Never said two words to you.

03:59.489 --> 04:02.701
- It's none of your business.
- I'm friends with the guy. I know him.

04:02.784 --> 04:05.245
OK, Horace, at this point,
I think I know him better.

04:05.328 --> 04:07.914
[siren wails]

04:08.915 --> 04:11.334
I dated a friend
of my brother's in high school.

04:11.418 --> 04:13.420
Really got under his skin too.

04:16.131 --> 04:18.925
Sorry, Mr. Templeton,
you'll de-plane through the rear.

04:19.009 --> 04:22.095
- Just the president up front.
- What? He's speaker of the house.

04:22.179 --> 04:25.599
I believe this is protocol.
I apologize for any inconvenience.

04:25.682 --> 04:28.226
- Let me speak to Jim.
- Jayne.

04:28.310 --> 04:30.437
Whatever your gal wants.
It's not the time.

04:30.520 --> 04:33.273
Where's Nathan?
He should be doing this with us.

04:33.356 --> 04:35.317
He's exiting the
rear of the plane, ma'am.

04:35.400 --> 04:38.069
Did I misunderstand?
I told him presidential staff only.

04:38.153 --> 04:40.739
- I should've been clearer. Jim?
- I'll take care of it.

04:42.449 --> 04:43.450
[Mac] Maria.

04:43.533 --> 04:45.660
Madam President.
We appreciate you coming.

04:45.744 --> 04:48.038
- It means a lot.
- Getting everything you need?

04:48.121 --> 04:50.957
Yes. Thanks for acting quickly
on the disaster package.

04:51.041 --> 04:53.168
- Of course.
- Isn't the speaker with you?

04:53.251 --> 04:55.045
He is. There was just a little mix-up.

04:55.128 --> 04:57.130
- He'll be right along.
- Oh, all right.

05:00.509 --> 05:01.802
[Jayne] Unbelievable.

05:01.885 --> 05:03.637
- What is...?
- It was a mistake, Jayne.

05:03.720 --> 05:06.389
Vince made a rookie mistake.
Please accept my apology.

05:06.473 --> 05:09.643
The president'd like for you
to join her at the press conference.

05:09.726 --> 05:11.812
- That's fine. Thank you.
- [radio chatter]

05:15.232 --> 05:17.984
Statewide we have over 60,000 homeless.

05:18.068 --> 05:21.404
- How many shelters have gone up?
- Seven in this county alone.

05:21.488 --> 05:24.074
From what they've told me,
that's not nearly enough.

05:24.157 --> 05:25.659
Bloody hell.

05:26.576 --> 05:30.539
This county was hit hard.
Over 500 homes destroyed.

05:31.581 --> 05:32.958
Oh.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.460
Could you folks hang back a bit?

05:35.544 --> 05:38.839
[Mac] You'll get what you need.
I promise. Thanks.

05:38.922 --> 05:43.260
- [reporters talking]
- [Mac sighs]

05:45.387 --> 05:47.472
[indistinct chatter]

05:47.556 --> 05:49.558
[man] You're doing fine, miss.

06:00.110 --> 06:02.320
You know, we're gonna do all we can.

06:04.364 --> 06:08.118
- We'll be OK.
- I know you will. I know you will.

06:08.201 --> 06:09.202
[Mac] Here you go.

06:09.286 --> 06:12.122
Our prayers are with you.
With you and your families.

06:12.205 --> 06:14.708
- I always voted your way.
- [Nathan chuckles] Hey!

06:14.791 --> 06:17.627
- Just don't tell her that.
- [Mac] I heard it.

06:17.711 --> 06:21.047
Grab some water. Food here.
We're a strong people, Madam President.

06:21.131 --> 06:22.132
Oh, I can see that.

06:22.215 --> 06:25.969
Strong and resilient
and extremely good-looking.

06:26.052 --> 06:27.679
[crowd laughs]

06:27.762 --> 06:30.307
[Nathan] We'll get back up on our feet.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.475
They work well together.

06:33.310 --> 06:36.354
- Strange bedfellows often do.
- Excuse me, Mr. Gardner?

06:36.563 --> 06:38.565
Bill Skinner, FEMA division director.

06:38.648 --> 06:40.734
Jayne Murray,
Templeton's chief of staff.

06:40.817 --> 06:42.861
- Pleasure.
- Can I borrow Jim for a moment?

06:42.944 --> 06:44.237
Of course.

06:44.946 --> 06:45.947
Do we have a problem?

06:46.031 --> 06:48.241
Just got word that
an oil tanker, the Cambria,

06:48.325 --> 06:50.827
is foundering 60 miles
off the coast of Florida.

06:50.911 --> 06:53.246
- We need to rescue crew?
- Crew's not the problem.

06:53.330 --> 06:57.083
Tanker took a beating in the hurricane.
She's leaking oil.

06:57.167 --> 06:58.335
How many gallons?

06:58.418 --> 07:00.837
Hundred thousand so far.
This is a supertanker.

07:00.921 --> 07:04.257
Bigger than Exxon Valdez. Carries
50 million gallons of heavy crude.

07:04.341 --> 07:06.760
She breaks, it's enough
to blanket the East Coast.

07:06.843 --> 07:07.844
How many know?

07:07.928 --> 07:10.263
I figured the president
should be the first.

07:11.348 --> 07:12.641
Thank you.

07:14.851 --> 07:18.605
- [whispering] We need your attention.
- OK. Who wants to finish this book?

07:18.688 --> 07:21.691
- [children] Me, me, me!
- OK. See ya, kids.

07:21.775 --> 07:23.360
[children] Bye!

07:25.111 --> 07:28.698
- Something's going on.
- Sure looks that way.

07:39.334 --> 07:40.794
[plane engines rumbling]

07:40.877 --> 07:43.630
[man] Fracture in the plating,
coupled with flooding

07:43.713 --> 07:46.633
- of an empty ballast wing tank.
- [Mac] How much oil she losing?

07:46.841 --> 07:50.762
- Estimating 10,000 gallons an hour.
- Coast Guard have recommendation?

07:50.845 --> 07:54.808
Two, neither risk-free. The first is we
send her beyond the continental shelf

07:54.891 --> 07:56.893
- and sink her in deep water.
- With cargo?

07:56.977 --> 07:59.020
Yes. The hope being the other tanks

07:59.136 --> 08:01.648
don't rupture and the crude
congeals in frigid waters.

08:01.731 --> 08:04.484
- If the tanks do rupture?
- Oil would hit the Gulf Stream,

08:04.693 --> 08:08.071
blanketing the Eastern Seaboard.
Trouble is, we can't predict when.

08:08.177 --> 08:10.031
Could be now, years from now, never.

08:10.165 --> 08:12.492
I hope your other option
is better, captain.

08:12.592 --> 08:15.537
Make temporary repairs.
Bring the ship into Port Canaveral.

08:15.661 --> 08:18.748
We could contain the spill
and offload the balance of the oil.

08:18.891 --> 08:20.917
- Where's the "but"?
- Patch might not hold.

08:21.017 --> 08:23.586
- Tanker could break up.
- The risk is the same.

08:23.670 --> 08:27.215
Yes and no. The closer to shore,
the more localized the problem.

08:27.339 --> 08:30.885
So our choice is between
risking Florida or half the East Coast.

08:33.471 --> 08:35.724
- Bring her in, captain.
- Yes, ma'am.

08:36.391 --> 08:39.934
I've been talking to Mackenzie about
this baseball commissioner thing,

08:40.034 --> 08:44.357
and, uh, well, she's pretty busy as...

08:44.441 --> 08:46.192
As you might imagine.

08:46.276 --> 08:49.195
Any concerns you'd be seen
as influencing policy?

08:51.015 --> 08:55.577
Well, first of all, I wouldn't be.
But there are other issues.

08:57.454 --> 09:00.749
Rod, we need to move on this.

09:00.874 --> 09:02.125
Right. Right.

09:02.234 --> 09:04.502
Rod, how's your swing these days?

09:04.586 --> 09:07.297
Got somebody we want you to meet.

09:07.405 --> 09:09.115
[bell ringing]

09:10.383 --> 09:12.227
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

09:12.427 --> 09:15.555
I was thinking, maybe we could
study for the biology exam tomorrow.

09:15.638 --> 09:17.265
- Yeah.
- I could use some help.

09:18.308 --> 09:21.519
J, I'm getting a C.
Thought you were good in bio?

09:21.603 --> 09:24.105
Or I could help you.
I mean, that'd be OK too.

09:24.237 --> 09:28.568
My, uh... My mom and dad'll be at work.
So the house will be quiet.

09:29.402 --> 09:31.446
I don't know.
Me going anywhere lately...

09:31.529 --> 09:33.656
- [phone rings]
- ...is kind of a big deal.

09:36.284 --> 09:39.454
Hello? Oh. Hey, Dad.
[whispering] Sorry.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.247
Uh... yeah.

09:43.259 --> 09:44.793
Are you serious?

09:45.912 --> 09:48.463
Sure... no. No, that'd be great.

09:48.546 --> 09:49.631
Yeah, I'm there.

09:50.965 --> 09:53.259
Sorry, J. Something came up.

09:56.096 --> 09:58.473
Governor Nuñez,
we're joined by the president.

09:59.265 --> 10:01.518
- [intercom beeps]
- [Nuñez] Madam President.

10:01.601 --> 10:04.564
I'm pleased to report we've
restored power to all but two counties.

10:04.714 --> 10:06.147
[Mac] That is good news.

10:06.264 --> 10:09.359
Maria, have you been
brought up to speed on the Cambria?

10:09.466 --> 10:11.611
- Yes, I have.
- We'll have to work together to get

10:11.694 --> 10:14.155
the ship into Canaveral
as soon as possible.

10:14.230 --> 10:15.540
I wanna minimize the spill.

10:15.617 --> 10:18.159
We've just been hit
by a category-three hurricane.

10:18.243 --> 10:20.120
We don't need another disaster.

10:20.245 --> 10:22.997
May I suggest bringing
the Cambria north?

10:23.172 --> 10:26.167
The Coast Guard is telling us
that risk increases exponentially

10:26.251 --> 10:28.211
the farther the ship has to travel.

10:28.294 --> 10:30.672
My experts think
it's best to share the risk.

10:30.831 --> 10:33.466
Perhaps the Cambria should be
taken out to sea and sunk.

10:33.550 --> 10:35.135
Maria, even if that worked,

10:35.218 --> 10:37.947
we'd just be leaving the problem
for future generations.

10:38.147 --> 10:40.557
We have to deal with this
in the right way.

10:40.765 --> 10:43.187
I'm sorry. I won't authorize this.

10:43.427 --> 10:47.539
Under state pollution and safety laws,
you have to obtain my permission

10:47.748 --> 10:50.942
before you bring
any toxic material into my state.

10:51.059 --> 10:54.390
Governor, you know the
Clean Water Act supersedes those laws.

10:54.612 --> 10:56.890
That's something
we're prepared to fight.

11:01.494 --> 11:04.330
Well, I'm sorry we don't see
eye to eye on this, Maria,

11:04.414 --> 11:07.167
but the Cambria is coming into port.

11:07.250 --> 11:09.252
- We'll speak later.
- Yes, we will.

11:09.335 --> 11:11.004
[intercom beeps]

11:11.087 --> 11:14.132
- I thought you two were friendly.
- So did I.

11:14.215 --> 11:16.009
[beeping]

11:16.092 --> 11:19.179
- Unbelievable.
- They're right on the law, you know.

11:19.262 --> 11:22.432
Technically, yeah. But with
a friendly judge and a little time...

11:22.515 --> 11:27.353
Mr. Speaker, your support
is greatly appreciated...

11:27.437 --> 11:29.439
...and quite unexpected.

11:29.522 --> 11:32.901
Because you're a Democrat?
You're a Floridian.

11:32.984 --> 11:35.361
You're the governor of our state.

11:35.445 --> 11:37.989
We cannot allow
the federal government

11:38.072 --> 11:42.118
to push us into this
environmental catastrophe.

11:43.870 --> 11:46.664
This is Jim Palmer,
three-time Cy Young Award winner.

11:46.748 --> 11:48.917
Nice to meet you.
Welcome to Camden Yards.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.336
- [Horace] It's an honor.
- This is Rick Dempsey.

11:51.419 --> 11:54.797
- 1983 World Series MVP.
- How ya doin', Horace?

11:54.881 --> 11:55.882
It's a pleasure.

11:55.965 --> 11:58.218
Hey. Tell your dad
to take the job, will ya?

11:58.301 --> 12:02.764
- [laughing] What job?
- Commissioner of baseball.

12:04.974 --> 12:06.976
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

12:07.894 --> 12:11.189
- [Horace laughs]
- [men clapping] All right. Yeah.

12:11.272 --> 12:14.025
- [locker slamming]
- [boy] You're not coming to practice?

12:14.108 --> 12:17.320
Horace completely blew it off,
so I can't. I'm sorry.

12:17.403 --> 12:20.114
- Maybe I'll blow it off too.
- You ready?

12:20.198 --> 12:21.950
Um... one sec.

12:23.159 --> 12:24.577
Really?

12:24.661 --> 12:27.580
Um... Well, what are you
going to do if you don't go?

12:27.664 --> 12:30.416
Just, you know, hang out.
Maybe grab a burger at Fred's.

12:30.500 --> 12:33.336
- I don't know.
- All right.

12:33.419 --> 12:35.922
- I'll see ya.
- Yeah.

12:36.714 --> 12:39.259
- Where's Horace?
- Went to meet your dad somewhere.

12:39.342 --> 12:41.511
- Got Velour. Heading out.
- [man] Copy that.

12:41.594 --> 12:45.807
Wait. You mean Dad
let Horace ditch class?

12:45.890 --> 12:48.226
- Well, then, I'm not rushing home.
- Becca.

12:48.309 --> 12:51.354
What? If Horace gets
to go someplace, then I do too.

12:53.439 --> 12:55.441
- Ah...
- Pretty good swing.

12:55.525 --> 12:57.944
- Good swing. Keep the back elbow up.
- OK.

12:58.027 --> 13:00.947
- Dad, you want to take a crack at it?
- Sure.

13:01.030 --> 13:03.783
You're sure Mom's OK
with this commissioner thing?

13:03.866 --> 13:06.536
[clears throat] I wouldn't say "OK,"
but, uh...

13:06.619 --> 13:08.413
Wait a minute. Move back a little bit.

13:08.496 --> 13:11.040
Give yourself some room.
You can really get into it.

13:11.124 --> 13:12.625
All right.

13:17.630 --> 13:18.631
[Horace] Nice.

13:18.715 --> 13:20.842
Madam,
governor of Georgia's been calling.

13:20.925 --> 13:23.636
- As has leadership from Greenpeace.
- Thank you, Laura.

13:23.720 --> 13:25.054
- Welcome back.
- Thank you.

13:25.138 --> 13:27.307
- Anything I can do for you?
- I'd like an hourly

13:27.390 --> 13:30.101
progress report on the
FEMA teams on the ground.

13:30.184 --> 13:32.520
Will do.
It's pretty bad down there, huh?

13:32.603 --> 13:36.024
[sighing] Yeah.
It's, uh, getting better,

13:36.107 --> 13:38.735
but it certainly makes you
count your blessings.

13:38.818 --> 13:42.155
Laura. I want everyone
home for dinner tonight.

13:42.238 --> 13:45.658
- Call Rod and see if he can make it?
- He's probably still at Camden Yards.

13:45.742 --> 13:48.077
- Sorry?
- The baseball commissioner thing.

13:48.828 --> 13:50.830
The job?

13:51.914 --> 13:53.916
Oh, I see.

13:54.876 --> 13:57.837
Well, um... Let's see
if we can reach him anyway.

13:57.920 --> 13:59.130
Yes, ma'am.

14:04.761 --> 14:08.514
The leaking tanker is now
50 miles off the Florida coast.

14:08.598 --> 14:12.185
The repairs made have held so far,
but this incident has brought attention,

14:12.268 --> 14:15.021
once again, to the dangers
inherent in transporting oil.

14:15.104 --> 14:17.815
Several environmental groups
have come out in support...

14:17.899 --> 14:20.068
[woman] This way.
The speaker just got back.

14:20.151 --> 14:22.028
He's expecting you.

14:22.111 --> 14:24.697
[reporter] Governor Maria Nuñez's
on the right track.

14:24.781 --> 14:26.866
Jared. Denise. Come on in.

14:26.949 --> 14:30.370
- Thanks for coming on short notice.
- Sit down. Please.

14:33.915 --> 14:36.709
Can't say we weren't
surprised by the invitation.

14:36.793 --> 14:39.003
I felt it was imperative that we meet.

14:39.087 --> 14:42.548
You haven't exactly voted
pro-conservation in the past.

14:42.632 --> 14:46.719
Well, differences can be creative.
It's just a question of degrees.

14:46.803 --> 14:49.722
I mean, sure, there've been
big government regulations

14:49.806 --> 14:52.225
that I'd had trouble with in the past,

14:52.308 --> 14:55.520
but we're not talking about
trace pesticides in beer here.

14:55.603 --> 14:57.897
We're talking about
what could be the largest

14:57.980 --> 15:00.608
environmental disaster
in our state's history.

15:04.320 --> 15:07.573
Secure Habitat's primary focus
is wildlife preservation.

15:07.657 --> 15:12.245
We're talking about
1500 miles of fouled coastline.

15:12.328 --> 15:14.705
Anyone can see
that it's not just people

15:14.789 --> 15:17.792
whose lives and habitats
need to be preserved.

15:21.170 --> 15:22.588
Let's be frank.

15:22.672 --> 15:26.259
You hold a press conference,
two or three local reporters show up.

15:26.342 --> 15:29.762
We hold one together...
national coverage.

15:34.016 --> 15:35.768
Next time we'll make a day of it.

15:35.852 --> 15:39.105
- [Horace] It was great, Dad. Thanks.
- Yeah. Yeah, you bet.

15:40.523 --> 15:42.525
- Hey, Nora.
- Hello, Horace.

15:44.318 --> 15:47.113
- How was your trip, sir?
- Oh, fantastic. How are you?

15:47.196 --> 15:50.116
May I speak freely, sir?

15:50.199 --> 15:52.285
- Of course.
- I'm feeling a little,

15:52.368 --> 15:54.954
- um, I don't know, in flux.
- In flux.

15:55.037 --> 15:57.957
My position. Your position.

15:58.040 --> 16:01.419
What with you spending
so much time... away.

16:01.502 --> 16:03.212
Ah.

16:05.131 --> 16:07.133
You missed several phone calls, sir.

16:07.216 --> 16:09.969
- One from the president.
- Nothing urgent, I imagine.

16:10.052 --> 16:11.971
She'd like the family home for dinner.

16:12.054 --> 16:14.474
That sounds great.

16:14.557 --> 16:16.058
- Ye...
- [footsteps receding]

16:21.814 --> 16:23.399
[man talking on radio]

16:23.483 --> 16:25.067
[Joan] Copy that.

16:26.068 --> 16:27.111
OK, Becca.

16:27.195 --> 16:29.989
You know, when Horace
has friends over it's no big deal.

16:30.072 --> 16:32.867
Uh, we're going in. Keep the cars close.

16:32.950 --> 16:36.120
Mike stays late one night
and Mom totally kicks him out.

16:36.204 --> 16:38.498
You know, I don't think they like him.

16:38.581 --> 16:41.250
And I have no idea
what Horace's problem is.

16:41.334 --> 16:42.668
Velour's in.

16:42.752 --> 16:44.712
Look, there he is.

16:44.795 --> 16:47.924
- He's cute, isn't he?
- Yeah, he's cute.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.008
[Rebecca giggles]

16:49.091 --> 16:50.551
[Rebecca] Hey, Mike.

16:50.635 --> 16:52.762
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

16:54.972 --> 16:56.516
- You made it.
- Yeah.

16:56.599 --> 16:57.767
Finally.

17:01.229 --> 17:03.523
- [door closing]
- Hey.

17:03.606 --> 17:06.526
Hey. Didn't know you were here.

17:06.609 --> 17:09.612
Makes us even. I didn't know
you were at Camden Yards.

17:11.072 --> 17:13.574
- I had a meeting.
- So I hear.

17:13.658 --> 17:16.327
Why does Kelly
know about it before I do?

17:17.703 --> 17:21.165
It's just something
that I mentioned in passing.

17:21.249 --> 17:23.334
You could've mentioned it
to me in passing.

17:23.417 --> 17:26.295
Say, when we were lying
in bed next to each other at night?

17:26.379 --> 17:28.548
Or over coffee in the morning?

17:28.631 --> 17:30.967
- I haven't signed anything.
- I can't believe...

17:31.050 --> 17:32.927
I can't believe you'd pursue this.

17:33.010 --> 17:36.305
Seriously pursue it
without even a word to me.

17:37.640 --> 17:41.894
You know, um, I feel like I should
apologize, but I don't know why.

17:41.978 --> 17:44.855
And frankly, I am starting to resent it.

17:45.648 --> 17:50.403
'Cause I was offered a job.
That's all. That's it. It's a good job.

17:50.486 --> 17:53.573
As it turns out, I'm uncomfortable
with the job I've got here.

17:53.656 --> 17:55.116
We had an understanding.

17:55.199 --> 17:58.202
At least, I thought
that we had an understanding.

17:59.787 --> 18:02.832
You see, that was a fantasy.
And I had the same one.

18:02.915 --> 18:06.210
I thought we could
do this together. We can't.

18:06.294 --> 18:08.462
You're where you should be. I'm not.

18:10.339 --> 18:13.551
[Nathan] The people
of Florida need shelter.

18:13.634 --> 18:18.055
- [cameras clicking]
- They need power. Food. Clothing.

18:18.139 --> 18:21.684
They need the prayers
of their fellow Americans.

18:21.767 --> 18:25.980
What they do not need
is a leaking tanker

18:26.063 --> 18:30.109
that threatens to foul our
already tragically damaged coastline.

18:30.192 --> 18:35.948
I've joined forces with Jared Lyons
and Denise Lambert of Secure Habitat,

18:36.032 --> 18:40.212
so that together
we could express our outrage.

18:41.187 --> 18:43.523
As cavalierly as this,

18:43.606 --> 18:47.710
the president is putting
our lives and our wildlife at risk.

18:48.210 --> 18:51.631
The president pledged that
she would do whatever she could

18:51.714 --> 18:53.924
to secure that hope, and that future.

18:54.008 --> 18:58.262
And then just a few hours later
she turned her back on us,

18:58.346 --> 19:03.100
and she embarked on a reckless course
of action that will destroy that hope,

19:03.184 --> 19:05.579
- that will sabotage...
- He knows how to put on a show.

19:06.062 --> 19:08.523
- [Nathan continues talking]
- And with Secure Habitat.

19:09.065 --> 19:11.875
Only time they've ever been
in the same room. Trust me.

19:12.401 --> 19:14.555
...filled with 50 million gallons of...

19:15.196 --> 19:16.705
[Horace turns TV off]

19:17.448 --> 19:19.241
- You OK?
- Oh, yeah.

19:19.325 --> 19:20.951
I'm not gonna let him get to me.

19:21.051 --> 19:25.331
- No. You and Dad.
- Yeah.

19:25.414 --> 19:27.667
Yeah. We're fine, Horace.

19:28.918 --> 19:32.171
It was pretty, uh...
It was good out there today.

19:32.463 --> 19:34.298
Yeah. I'll bet.

19:35.201 --> 19:36.384
He was happy, Mom.

19:37.101 --> 19:38.928
[sighing]

19:39.178 --> 19:43.140
- So she really is all over you, huh?
- Oh...

19:43.288 --> 19:45.101
Yeah. Guess so.

19:45.184 --> 19:48.938
I mean, how's a guy supposed
to kiss you good night?

19:49.036 --> 19:51.565
Um...

19:51.649 --> 19:53.651
Just give me a sec, OK?

19:57.515 --> 19:58.948
You ready?

19:59.065 --> 20:01.867
Um, Joan, I don't really
know how to say this, but...

20:01.951 --> 20:04.745
Well, you were a girl once, right?

20:04.829 --> 20:06.789
Well, you are a girl. Obviously.

20:06.923 --> 20:10.042
Anyways, I...
I really, really like this guy.

20:10.209 --> 20:12.169
I know, Becca. That's why we're here.

20:13.045 --> 20:15.549
I was wondering if I could
have some time with him alone.

20:15.774 --> 20:18.027
We have procedures. I can't let...

20:18.217 --> 20:22.388
I know, but his car's parked right out
back. And I have my panic button.

20:22.513 --> 20:25.224
We'll only be ten minutes.
I'll be right outside the door.

20:25.307 --> 20:28.227
I promise. Please, Joan? Please?

20:28.310 --> 20:30.854
- [door closes]
- [radio plays]

20:31.480 --> 20:33.082
- Ten.
- Thank you.

20:33.432 --> 20:35.818
- [whispers] Go!
- Right. OK. Thank you.

20:38.571 --> 20:40.823
- Come on. Let's get out of here.
- All right.

20:40.906 --> 20:41.991
[mouths silently]

20:43.534 --> 20:45.819
If the Cambria
breaks up on our shores,

20:46.128 --> 20:49.549
will this administration
find our citizens jobs or homes?

20:49.832 --> 20:52.418
Never know who your
next friend will be in politics.

20:52.501 --> 20:56.380
Will it pay to clean up the worst
environmental disaster in our history?

20:56.464 --> 20:59.759
The people of this state
cannot take that chance.

20:59.842 --> 21:02.052
Federal Judge Virgil Hayes

21:02.136 --> 21:04.972
has granted our request
for a temporary restraining order

21:05.055 --> 21:07.099
- forbidding Cambria
- That legal?

21:07.183 --> 21:09.518
- from entering Florida's...
- She got it ex parte.

21:09.602 --> 21:12.271
Or he did. Hayes is an
old crony of the speaker's.

21:12.354 --> 21:14.690
...the captain of the Cambria
and directed him

21:14.774 --> 21:17.485
to turn the tanker out to sea.

21:24.033 --> 21:26.786
- You the president's daughter?
- Can we get an autograph?

21:26.869 --> 21:28.454
- Sign this.
- Don't have a pen.

21:28.537 --> 21:29.497
Guys, come on.

21:29.580 --> 21:31.123
- Oh, I have a pen.
- Guys, come on.

21:31.207 --> 21:33.501
Hey, man. Look. Back off, all right.

21:33.584 --> 21:35.127
[all talking]

21:35.211 --> 21:37.588
I wouldn't vote for your mom,
even if I could.

21:37.671 --> 21:39.465
- Please leave me alone.
- Guys.

21:39.548 --> 21:43.010
- Get off me!
- [girl] I got it!

21:43.093 --> 21:45.971
- Out of my way!
- [man] Did you do anything...?

21:46.055 --> 21:47.306
I said back off, all right?

21:47.389 --> 21:49.141
[all shouting]

21:53.229 --> 21:54.897
Step back! I got you.

21:57.066 --> 21:59.777
[Joan] Step back now!

22:03.656 --> 22:06.075
- [man] We'll get the TRO overturned.
- But how long

22:06.158 --> 22:07.993
before we hear from the appeals court?

22:08.077 --> 22:10.204
- A day or two, at best.
- If we used the press?

22:10.287 --> 22:13.541
If we get the public behind us,
they won't care if we violate the TRO.

22:13.624 --> 22:16.335
Meaning we're above the law?
That's how it's gonna look.

22:16.418 --> 22:18.838
Maybe Kelly has a point.
I mean, it's a bogus order.

22:18.921 --> 22:21.674
But a legal document.
We violate it only as a last resort.

22:21.757 --> 22:24.385
- OK, give me a first resort.
- If the Coast Guard, the EPA

22:24.468 --> 22:28.180
and the tanker's captain go on record
that it's safe to bring Cambria to port,

22:28.264 --> 22:30.558
the judge might feel
comfortable overturning.

22:30.641 --> 22:33.519
- Might move quickly.
- What'd we hear from the Coast Guard?

22:33.602 --> 22:35.771
Hairline stress cracks
appeared in the hull.

22:35.855 --> 22:37.690
For now, the ship's stopped leaking.

22:37.773 --> 22:41.819
OK. I want the public inundated with the
message that what we're doing is right.

22:41.902 --> 22:44.196
Governors from
surrounding states are with us.

22:44.280 --> 22:45.364
[Jim] Get them on air.

22:45.447 --> 22:48.033
I'll have EPA, the Coast Guard,
NOAA make statements.

22:48.117 --> 22:50.536
We lined up like-minded
environmental groups.

22:50.619 --> 22:52.746
Let's talk to
Templeton's chief of staff.

22:52.830 --> 22:55.666
- Jayne Murray.
- Wanna see what the speaker's brewing.

22:55.749 --> 22:56.834
Thank you, everyone.

22:57.793 --> 22:59.545
Admiral, please stay.

22:59.628 --> 23:02.131
- There's something else.
- Yes, ma'am.

23:05.301 --> 23:07.970
- You wanted to see me, sir?
- [Rod] Yeah.

23:08.053 --> 23:10.055
I was just given an incident report.

23:10.139 --> 23:11.640
- Yes, sir.
- Needless to say,

23:11.724 --> 23:13.809
- I'm not happy about it.
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

23:13.893 --> 23:17.730
She just... She got
away from me for a moment.

23:19.481 --> 23:22.735
You know, time gets away from us.

23:22.818 --> 23:25.738
And the budget gets away from us.

23:25.821 --> 23:28.407
But my daughter
doesn't just get away from us.

23:28.490 --> 23:31.327
- She wanted a little privacy...
- Do you have kids, Joan?

23:31.410 --> 23:33.037
- No.
- See, they're always asking

23:33.120 --> 23:36.707
for things you can't give them.
Not because you can't or don't want to.

23:36.790 --> 23:39.668
[shouting] But because you know better!

23:40.628 --> 23:42.755
I've requested you be transferred.

23:44.214 --> 23:46.467
I hope you understand why.

23:48.510 --> 23:52.056
[stuttering] I do, sir. I'm sorry.

23:57.937 --> 24:00.230
So how long we gonna wait for Mom?

24:01.231 --> 24:03.859
I don't know. How about
until she gets here, Rebecca.

24:03.943 --> 24:05.945
Whatever, I just... I'm not hungry.

24:06.028 --> 24:07.446
[grunts]

24:07.529 --> 24:10.449
- Everything OK, Dad?
- Yeah.

24:10.532 --> 24:11.951
Hey. Sorry, I'm late.

24:12.034 --> 24:13.535
- Mommy.
- Hey, baby.

24:13.619 --> 24:15.955
[Mac] OK.

24:16.038 --> 24:18.624
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

24:18.707 --> 24:21.085
Who wants to do the honors?

24:21.168 --> 24:23.045
Me?

24:24.797 --> 24:26.048
[Mac] Dear Lord.

24:26.131 --> 24:30.427
We ask a special blessing on those
without homes, food or loved ones.

24:30.511 --> 24:34.139
Encourage them in this
difficult time and meet their needs.

24:34.932 --> 24:39.478
And help us, as a family, to be grateful
for all the gifts You've given us.

24:39.561 --> 24:40.980
- Amen.
- Amen.

24:41.063 --> 24:42.064
[children] Amen.

24:47.029 --> 24:49.154
Becca, you had quite a day.

24:49.271 --> 24:52.733
With Agent Greer.
She's no longer on your detail.

24:53.534 --> 24:55.160
- Why?
- I had her transferred.

24:55.244 --> 24:56.912
- But I liked her.
- Maybe something

24:56.996 --> 24:58.163
we can talk about later.

24:58.247 --> 25:01.458
Greer allowed you to go off radar
and you got mobbed in a parking lot.

25:01.542 --> 25:03.335
Dad, they just wanted autographs.

25:03.419 --> 25:07.089
Because you lack judgment,
it is crucial that your agent has it.

25:07.172 --> 25:09.258
- Do you disagree?
- No, I don't disagree...

25:09.341 --> 25:11.093
Does anyone want potatoes?

25:13.303 --> 25:15.764
- Becca never liked her.
- Yes, she did.

25:15.848 --> 25:19.476
She should've thought about that
before sneaking off with her boyfriend.

25:20.436 --> 25:24.898
OK. We are all at the table.
Together. For the first time in weeks.

25:24.982 --> 25:26.275
So...

25:26.358 --> 25:29.194
...can we just eat? Please?

25:33.115 --> 25:35.534
May I be excused? I'm not hungry.

25:35.617 --> 25:38.787
No. We're gonna sit here
and have dinner like a family.

25:47.796 --> 25:49.923
[Jim] Is your boss
working bankers' hours?

25:50.007 --> 25:51.800
The speaker had a dinner engagement.

25:51.884 --> 25:54.386
He'll be back. Work till ten, no doubt.

25:55.304 --> 25:58.140
- Drink?
- Not tonight.

26:00.392 --> 26:01.935
Jayne, a TRO?

26:02.019 --> 26:05.064
Now there was a day when
you'd have given me a heads-up.

26:06.815 --> 26:09.902
- Was a day we were on the same team.
- This isn't time for politics.

26:09.985 --> 26:13.238
Speaker's an advocate of state's rights,
what's best for Florida.

26:13.322 --> 26:15.657
It turns out that's
what's best for the country,

26:15.741 --> 26:17.743
which is to make this thing go away.

26:17.826 --> 26:20.245
Sink that ship
out in the middle of the ocean.

26:20.329 --> 26:23.582
Let our grandkids deal with it
when those tanks rust and implode

26:23.665 --> 26:26.043
fifty years from now.

26:26.126 --> 26:30.130
Tell her he's won, Jim.
This time she backs down.

26:34.551 --> 26:36.762
- Hey.
- [Kelly] Hey.

26:36.845 --> 26:39.515
Listen, I didn't realize
that you hadn't said anything

26:39.598 --> 26:41.266
about the baseball deal and I...

26:41.350 --> 26:43.769
I hope I didn't cause any problems.

26:43.852 --> 26:46.105
None that weren't already there.

26:48.357 --> 26:52.611
- You looking for somebody?
- Oh, no, I'm... wandering, I guess.

26:52.694 --> 26:54.863
- Did you decide?
- On...?

26:54.947 --> 26:56.406
- On the job.
- Oh.

26:56.490 --> 26:58.325
[inhaling] Mmm...

27:00.119 --> 27:03.789
All right. Well...
I'm around if you ever need to talk.

27:03.872 --> 27:06.208
Thanks. Yeah.

27:06.291 --> 27:08.293
That means a lot.

27:13.048 --> 27:14.007
[TV volume low]

27:14.091 --> 27:18.554
[Sarah] I've come to shackle you
and drag you home.

27:18.637 --> 27:21.723
- I surrender.
- [Sarah laughs]

27:23.100 --> 27:24.726
[Sarah] Oh...

27:25.144 --> 27:27.354
- How'd you get here?
- [sighs]

27:27.437 --> 27:29.481
You didn't drive, did you?

27:29.565 --> 27:32.192
- Oh, it's two miles.
- [Nathan sighs]

27:32.276 --> 27:33.652
You can drive us home.

27:33.735 --> 27:37.990
- Honey, I really wish you wouldn't...
- Oh, I'm not a china teacup,

27:38.073 --> 27:41.410
and you haven't been my doctor
for over 30 years, so just...

27:46.790 --> 27:48.417
Did you see it?

27:48.500 --> 27:51.587
- The house?
- No.

27:52.796 --> 27:55.340
There wasn't... time.

27:55.924 --> 27:58.927
[sighing] I couldn't bear to, really.

27:59.845 --> 28:02.931
And there was all this stuff
about the tanker, so...

28:07.936 --> 28:11.648
You're protecting our home.
Our friends. Our state.

28:11.732 --> 28:14.359
- I'm proud of you.
- [Nathan sighs]

28:14.443 --> 28:17.863
You're doing the right thing.

28:19.114 --> 28:21.074
I don't know.

28:21.158 --> 28:24.703
No, I hope so. I mean, I think so.

28:24.786 --> 28:26.413
[stuttering] I do think so.

28:26.496 --> 28:27.915
But it's just...

28:27.998 --> 28:33.212
I got so damn angry
about that stupid airplane business.

28:33.295 --> 28:36.131
Back door for God's sakes.

28:37.799 --> 28:39.801
[Nathan chuckles]

28:42.137 --> 28:45.849
Oh, you look positively regal,
Mrs. Templeton.

28:46.934 --> 28:49.811
You're gonna make
one splendid first lady.

29:06.870 --> 29:08.830
So, are you just gonna take this job?

29:08.914 --> 29:11.166
- Can you make me a better offer?
- Don't do that.

29:11.250 --> 29:13.669
- Don't be a smartass when I'm...
- All right. Look.

29:13.752 --> 29:16.088
How about if we talk
about something important?

29:16.171 --> 29:20.259
Call the chief justice and tell him
that you need an immediate decision.

29:20.342 --> 29:23.553
Then you get Nuñez face-to-face.
She's in D.C. for a FEMA meeting.

29:23.637 --> 29:25.889
Bring Templeton. You need him to deal.

29:25.973 --> 29:28.976
If you want cooperation,
you're gonna have to make sure

29:29.059 --> 29:31.478
they come out
in better shape than they came in.

29:31.561 --> 29:35.565
They've seen the same research you have
on the risks of sinking that tanker.

29:35.649 --> 29:38.402
My guess is they're looking
for an exit. Give 'em one.

29:42.531 --> 29:44.533
[sighs]

29:53.041 --> 29:56.461
[phone ringing]

29:59.965 --> 30:01.091
Yeah.

30:01.174 --> 30:03.343
[approaching footsteps]

30:04.219 --> 30:05.595
[man] Attention!

30:05.679 --> 30:07.931
- [Mac] Evening.
- [man] Good evening, ma'am.

30:08.015 --> 30:10.142
Madam President.
Sorry for the late call.

30:10.225 --> 30:13.270
We have a Coast Guard C-130
overhead round the clock

30:13.353 --> 30:15.230
and we pulled a cutter up from Key West.

30:15.314 --> 30:17.774
[Trenton] Steady at six degrees,
starboard list.

30:17.858 --> 30:21.028
[man] Captain, we have the
president of the United States with us.

30:21.111 --> 30:23.280
Get Templeton and Nuñez
in here first thing.

30:23.363 --> 30:25.073
- Yes, ma'am.
- Captain, how are you?

30:25.157 --> 30:27.576
Never been through
a hurricane like that.

30:27.659 --> 30:30.829
Glad you made it.
Can you bring her safely to port?

30:30.912 --> 30:33.415
If seas stay calm, yes.
But that's just my opinion.

30:33.498 --> 30:36.501
- Can we get a statement to that effect?
- I can't do that, ma'am.

30:36.585 --> 30:38.503
See, I've got family.
I can't go to jail.

30:38.587 --> 30:41.173
- Who said anything about jail?
- Governor Nuñez.

30:41.256 --> 30:43.633
She said if I violated
the restraining order...

30:43.717 --> 30:46.928
I can't afford a lawsuit or some
big fine. Best to send her down.

30:47.012 --> 30:49.014
Are you saying
you want to sink your ship?

30:49.097 --> 30:50.349
I don't have much choice.

30:50.432 --> 30:52.601
Madam President,
you may wanna look at this.

30:52.684 --> 30:54.853
- Captain, keep this line open.
- Yes, ma'am.

30:54.936 --> 30:58.190
Ran projections to see what'd
happen if the governor's successful

30:58.273 --> 31:00.609
in sinking the tanker
and the oil didn't congeal.

31:00.692 --> 31:02.861
- And?
- It'll travel up the Gulf Stream

31:02.944 --> 31:04.321
at approximately six knots.

31:04.404 --> 31:07.866
In seven hours, you would have
intermittent contamination in Georgia.

31:07.949 --> 31:11.870
In 48 hours, the Carolinas.
And in four days...

31:11.953 --> 31:13.497
Virginia.

31:18.085 --> 31:20.629
The president is
a firm believer in state's rights.

31:20.712 --> 31:25.217
However, a potential disaster like
the Cambria requires federal action.

31:25.300 --> 31:27.552
Governor Nuñez represents her state.

31:27.636 --> 31:30.055
President Allen represents
the American people.

31:30.138 --> 31:33.642
Her oath requires her to act
in their best interests of all.

31:33.725 --> 31:35.769
OK. I'll open up to some questions.

31:35.852 --> 31:37.062
- [all] Kelly!
- Charlie.

31:37.145 --> 31:39.439
If the president
can't get the order reversed,

31:39.523 --> 31:42.818
- will she break the court order?
- The president has every intention

31:42.901 --> 31:44.569
- of following the law.
- Follow up.

31:44.653 --> 31:45.737
[clamoring]

31:46.405 --> 31:49.908
- The president needs a few minutes.
- Sure. Whatever. Anything.

31:49.991 --> 31:54.996
Relax. The restraining order can't be
overturned before tomorrow afternoon.

31:55.080 --> 31:59.084
By that time, the captain'll have
sunk the ship. You'll be a hero.

31:59.167 --> 32:00.752
The state of Florida has stood up

32:00.836 --> 32:03.964
- to the federal government.
- I don't know if I disagree with her.

32:04.047 --> 32:06.466
I hope she understands
this was done in good faith.

32:06.550 --> 32:09.761
Sure she does.
She's a very principled person.

32:09.845 --> 32:13.181
[chuckling] Very principled.

32:16.017 --> 32:18.645
- Well?
- Thank you.

32:18.728 --> 32:21.565
- 211 to 212.
- Bloody hell.

32:22.441 --> 32:24.943
Last congressman
cast a vote over an hour ago.

32:25.026 --> 32:27.821
Dems are pushing for you
to concede and bang the gavel.

32:31.491 --> 32:33.285
How long's she been waiting?

32:33.368 --> 32:36.496
- Forty minutes.
- That oughta do it.

32:36.580 --> 32:39.082
- Bring her in.
- [woman] Yes, sir.

32:47.841 --> 32:49.634
- [Nathan] Ms. Allen.
- Mr. Speaker.

32:49.718 --> 32:52.012
- Thank you so much for coming in.
- Not at all.

32:52.095 --> 32:53.138
- Hi.
- Nice to see you.

32:53.221 --> 32:54.764
- Thank you.
- Sit down. Please.

32:54.848 --> 32:56.183
Thanks.

32:57.559 --> 32:59.895
So, how are you
enjoying your first term?

32:59.978 --> 33:03.356
- Well, still trying to feel my way.
- Well, that I can appreciate.

33:04.232 --> 33:07.110
I'm... I'm really sorry
that we had to keep you waiting,

33:07.194 --> 33:09.821
but we're in the thick
of this airline resolution.

33:09.905 --> 33:13.283
- Not a problem.
- It's-It's such an important bill.

33:13.366 --> 33:16.453
It requires every Republican vote.

33:16.536 --> 33:21.750
I mean, if this thing doesn't get
passed, it means hundreds of lost jobs.

33:21.833 --> 33:23.084
Not just at the hub.

33:23.168 --> 33:27.005
True, but I just don't think taxpayers
should shoulder the burden

33:27.088 --> 33:30.342
for executives who run
their companies into the ground.

33:30.425 --> 33:33.011
[chuckling]

33:33.094 --> 33:35.805
Ms. Allen... Mac.
That's what you go by?

33:35.889 --> 33:37.015
Mac it is.

33:37.098 --> 33:41.019
As speaker of the house,
I have a lot of people talking to me.

33:41.102 --> 33:44.022
Nonstop, really.
They plumb wear my ear out.

33:44.105 --> 33:46.650
Do you have any idea
what they're telling me?

33:46.733 --> 33:48.276
No clue.

33:48.360 --> 33:53.114
They're saying, "Help breeds help."

33:54.074 --> 33:56.826
Help those who help.

33:56.910 --> 33:58.286
Hmm.

33:58.537 --> 34:02.082
Well, people are free to say
all kinds of things, I expect.

34:02.165 --> 34:06.503
Personally, I think there are better
ways to spend 15 billion dollars.

34:09.673 --> 34:12.384
You're crossing a bridge,
congresswoman.

34:12.467 --> 34:17.222
- You know where you're going?
- I do, Mr. Speaker. Home.

34:17.305 --> 34:20.725
If you'll excuse me, I'd like to go home
and have dinner with my family.

34:20.809 --> 34:23.603
I'm, uh... not changing my vote.

34:25.564 --> 34:27.691
Thank you.

34:27.774 --> 34:29.484
[Mac] Thank you.

34:29.568 --> 34:32.070
[door closing]

34:32.153 --> 34:34.656
- [sighing] She's a piece of work.
- [door opening]

34:34.739 --> 34:37.033
- [Vince] She's ready for you.
- Is she indeed?

34:38.159 --> 34:40.161
Let's go.

34:44.165 --> 34:46.751
I'm sorry, ma'am.
I have not changed my mind.

34:46.835 --> 34:49.087
The calls that I've been getting

34:49.170 --> 34:52.549
say that the voters are totally
in agreement with the governor.

34:52.632 --> 34:54.593
How's your mail been going?

34:54.676 --> 34:58.930
Nathan, as a congressman, your
interests are bounded by your district.

34:59.014 --> 35:01.391
But as speaker,
third in line to the presidency,

35:01.474 --> 35:03.768
I would have thought
you'd think more globally.

35:03.852 --> 35:07.515
- Well, each office has its obligations.
- [Mac] And liabilities.

35:07.840 --> 35:11.024
We try to limit the damage.
Sometimes that's the best we can do.

35:11.651 --> 35:14.195
[sighing] Let's get this straight.

35:14.279 --> 35:18.382
This is not a matter of
whether or not you can convince us.

35:18.867 --> 35:22.954
- You can't.
- Then perhaps we can entice you.

35:23.038 --> 35:25.707
As you know, Mr. Speaker,
the Pentagon's recommended

35:25.790 --> 35:27.792
a number of base closures
in other states.

35:27.876 --> 35:31.379
You've lobbied forcefully to move
a few of those to Florida, governor.

35:31.463 --> 35:32.464
Madam President,

35:32.547 --> 35:37.010
I can't negotiate away my obligation
to do what's best for Florida.

35:37.093 --> 35:40.305
Maria, I can't offer you
a perfect solution.

35:40.388 --> 35:43.475
But that's what we're paid for.
To make the difficult decisions.

35:43.558 --> 35:46.436
Bringing the Cambria in
is the right thing. You know it.

35:46.519 --> 35:50.649
I won't roll the dice. Not with the
luck Florida's having. I am sorry.

35:53.985 --> 35:56.738
Sounds to me like we're done here.

35:57.864 --> 35:59.824
We're just getting started.

35:59.908 --> 36:02.535
Please give us a few minutes.

36:05.747 --> 36:07.999
[door opening]

36:09.584 --> 36:11.211
- Politics.
- The worst kind.

36:11.753 --> 36:13.338
Coffee, anyone?

36:13.421 --> 36:15.674
[indistinct chatter]

36:20.470 --> 36:21.971
Rebecca.

36:22.055 --> 36:25.016
Good morning. I'm Agent Powers.
I'm your new point person.

36:25.100 --> 36:27.018
- Right.
- Was just on my way to find you.

36:27.102 --> 36:28.395
You ready for school?

36:28.478 --> 36:31.856
Um, yeah.
So is Greer just gone or whatever?

36:31.940 --> 36:35.318
She's clearing out her desk,
but she briefed me on your particulars.

36:35.402 --> 36:36.611
Oh.

36:36.695 --> 36:41.700
Could you just, um...?
Excuse me. Thank you.

36:41.783 --> 36:44.869
- Joan.
- Hey, Becca.

36:44.953 --> 36:47.956
Um, look...
I just wanted you to know...

36:48.039 --> 36:52.043
- I really didn't mean this to happen.
- Yeah, I know.

36:52.127 --> 36:55.171
So is this... Is this, like, a big deal?

36:55.255 --> 36:58.633
I mean, are you just
gonna cover some other kid?

36:58.717 --> 37:01.261
There's only one
presidential detail, Becca.

37:03.263 --> 37:06.641
Oh... Right.

37:08.476 --> 37:10.270
[Rebecca] Joan...

37:10.353 --> 37:13.231
[sighing]

37:13.314 --> 37:16.526
I'm, really, really sorry.

37:17.485 --> 37:18.778
Yeah.

37:25.577 --> 37:27.620
- Rebecca?
- Yeah.

37:27.704 --> 37:30.999
- Time to go.
- OK.

37:32.375 --> 37:34.043
[Nuñez] Maybe she's right.

37:34.127 --> 37:36.921
Our people are worried
about the risks of sinking the ship.

37:37.005 --> 37:41.092
We could gain thousands of jobs if the
Pentagon shifts more bases to Florida.

37:41.176 --> 37:42.260
Hey.

37:42.343 --> 37:47.974
Somebody offers you crumbs, means
they've got a loaf of bread somewhere.

37:48.975 --> 37:51.770
Look, if we're gonna
ease up on the Cambria...

37:51.853 --> 37:54.314
And I don't like it.
I don't think it's right.

37:54.397 --> 37:58.067
But if we do, then we have
to come away with a deal so sweet

37:58.151 --> 38:00.695
our critics don't
have a leg to stand on.

38:01.988 --> 38:05.617
- We could leave empty-handed.
- Nerves of steel.

38:05.700 --> 38:08.453
- You're doing great.
- [Mac] You're certain about this?

38:08.536 --> 38:12.373
Just got final word, ma'am.
This is usually reserved for wartime,

38:12.457 --> 38:15.794
but under these circumstances
you are well within your authority.

38:15.877 --> 38:18.963
Madam President.
How are you gonna play it?

38:19.047 --> 38:21.174
Sun Tzu. The Art of War.

38:21.257 --> 38:23.968
"Always leave your enemies
an escape route."

38:28.807 --> 38:29.933
[door opening]

38:33.812 --> 38:35.188
You know the admiral.

38:35.271 --> 38:37.148
- Hey, admiral.
- Mr. Speaker.

38:37.232 --> 38:39.150
- Governor Nuñez.
- Sir.

38:39.234 --> 38:42.862
I hope she hasn't asked you
to bomb us into submission.

38:43.071 --> 38:44.405
[all chuckle]

38:44.489 --> 38:47.784
I've decided to bring the Cambria
into Mayport Naval Base.

38:47.949 --> 38:50.245
- That's Florida property.
- Actually, it's federal.

38:50.411 --> 38:53.618
I'm commissioning the tanker
as a U.S. Coast Guard vessel.

38:53.818 --> 38:56.820
- You're ignoring the restraining order?
- You'll see it's overturned.

38:57.020 --> 38:59.587
Judges know how to read tea leaves.

39:01.881 --> 39:04.509
You guys are asking an awful lot from us

39:04.592 --> 39:07.929
for a very small
concession on your part.

39:08.012 --> 39:10.473
I mean, shifting
military bases around...

39:10.557 --> 39:14.477
If you're worried about a flip-flop,
I'm sure I can offer a graceful way out.

39:14.561 --> 39:16.813
What more are you looking for?

39:16.896 --> 39:21.442
Oh, you know, the terrible strain
of a catastrophic situation

39:21.526 --> 39:26.197
can sometimes be alleviated
by solving lesser problems.

39:26.281 --> 39:27.362
Such as?

39:27.448 --> 39:31.337
- Increasing Medicaid funding, for one.
- [Nathan] Support for my highway bill.

39:31.494 --> 39:34.581
Making the ban
on oil drilling permanent.

39:34.664 --> 39:38.209
I am struck by your newfound
interest in the environment.

39:38.293 --> 39:42.005
We need to reduce our dependence
on foreign oil, so "no" on the ban.

39:42.094 --> 39:46.301
But the other two items I will
take under serious consideration.

39:48.094 --> 39:50.346
- [inhaling] OK.
- All right.

39:50.430 --> 39:52.724
I'll expect an announcement
of our compromise

39:52.807 --> 39:55.018
when the Cambria's
within ten miles of port.

39:55.101 --> 39:56.269
Five miles.

39:56.694 --> 39:59.355
If it breaks up before that,
you take the heat.

39:59.530 --> 40:03.067
I think we have a deal, Mr. Speaker.
Governor?

40:04.144 --> 40:06.688
Good. All right.
Let's get the Cambria online.

40:06.821 --> 40:07.989
Yes, ma'am.

40:08.489 --> 40:11.701
- [Amy] What's an RBI?
- [Rod] Runs batted in.

40:12.794 --> 40:15.630
[Amy] What's runs batted...? Mommy!

40:16.164 --> 40:19.083
- Can I watch cartoons?
- No! No.

40:19.167 --> 40:20.168
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:20.251 --> 40:22.462
I hear the Cambria
made it back to port safely.

40:22.545 --> 40:23.755
- Yes.
- Congrats.

40:23.838 --> 40:25.924
I wasn't in it alone.

40:26.007 --> 40:28.927
Why do I have to watch
dumb ol' baseball?

40:30.011 --> 40:33.932
Well, because it's going
to be Daddy's newest job.

40:34.991 --> 40:38.537
- Really?
- Really.
