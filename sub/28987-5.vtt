00:17.600 --> 00:21.359
I'm assuming
this isn't good news.

00:21.360 --> 00:25.719
Rob told me that you had a visit
from the misper team.

00:25.720 --> 00:28.559
He's worried that
they might have found Sarah.

00:28.560 --> 00:30.159
They haven't, have they?

00:30.160 --> 00:31.799
No.

00:31.800 --> 00:34.839
But they're winding down
the inquiry.

00:34.840 --> 00:37.080
Which means they think
she's dead.

00:39.480 --> 00:41.520
Who am I kidding?

00:43.640 --> 00:45.959
You forget about the gun,
and I'll...

00:45.960 --> 00:47.279
I'll tell you all about it.

00:47.280 --> 00:49.079
That's right.

00:49.080 --> 00:51.560
Sarah Bradford
is very much alive.

01:27.320 --> 01:29.880
Got it.
Thanks.

01:35.480 --> 01:36.759
We've got a body.

01:36.760 --> 01:38.799
Greenwich.
Near the river.

01:38.800 --> 01:40.479
I'll come with you,

01:40.480 --> 01:42.680
given that your colleagues
have done a disappearing act.

01:52.760 --> 01:53.999
Mr. Roscoe.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.879
Danny Roscoe, open up.
It's the police.

01:55.880 --> 01:58.079
Open up.

01:58.080 --> 01:59.840
How credible is your tip-off?

02:04.240 --> 02:05.319
Billie?

02:05.320 --> 02:07.079
We've got a body
in Greenwich.

02:07.080 --> 02:09.119
I'll text you the details.

02:09.120 --> 02:10.839
Uniform have got an I.D.
for the victim.

02:10.840 --> 02:13.439
Taxi driver
called Danny Roscoe.

02:13.440 --> 02:15.519
Could you repeat that,
please?

02:15.520 --> 02:17.079
Danny Roscoe.

02:17.080 --> 02:20.719
Yeah, that's what I thought
you said.

02:20.720 --> 02:22.279
What?

02:22.280 --> 02:24.359
You can stop looking
for Danny Roscoe.

02:24.360 --> 02:25.360
Why?

02:25.361 --> 02:27.400
He's dead.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.999
Strange place
to park a black cab.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.959
It's not like he'd be
dropping off a passenger.

02:51.960 --> 02:54.519
- Morning.
- Boss.

02:54.520 --> 02:55.919
How did he die?

02:55.920 --> 02:57.920
Someone staved
the back of his head in.

02:58.880 --> 03:00.359
Robbery?

03:00.360 --> 03:02.079
No.
Still got his wallet.

03:02.080 --> 03:03.959
Complete with cards and cash.

03:03.960 --> 03:07.119
We also found his membership
card for the Chasing Red Casino,

03:07.120 --> 03:10.000
where Marcus Maguire
was shot dead yesterday.

03:12.120 --> 03:13.920
There's something
I need to tell you.

03:22.040 --> 03:23.679
I got a tip-off.

03:23.680 --> 03:26.399
The informant claimed
that he knew your wife is alive

03:26.400 --> 03:30.120
and that this guy, Danny Roscoe,
knew where she was.

03:40.400 --> 03:42.120
Who was the tip-off from?

03:43.680 --> 03:44.720
That's not relevant.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.759
He won't tell me either.

03:47.760 --> 03:49.999
Have you been to
Roscoe's address?

03:50.000 --> 03:52.399
Uh, yeah,
but there was no answer.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.799
- Did you carry out a search?
- Not yet.

03:54.800 --> 03:56.479
Get on it.
Call me from there.

03:56.480 --> 03:58.519
Billie, find out everything
you can about our murder victim.

03:58.520 --> 04:00.080
Rob, come with me.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.320
Who's your source?

04:11.880 --> 04:13.839
Adrian Cook.

04:13.840 --> 04:15.559
I caught him with the gun

04:15.560 --> 04:19.199
that was used to kill Marcus
and Callum Maguire yesterday.

04:19.200 --> 04:22.960
I was about to arrest him,
but he made me an offer.

04:24.520 --> 04:27.479
If I turned a blind eye, then
he'd give me the name of the guy

04:27.480 --> 04:29.079
that saw Sarah alive.

04:29.080 --> 04:30.279
Where's the gun now?

04:30.280 --> 04:31.800
I stashed it
in my neighbor's garden.

04:32.960 --> 04:35.879
They're away at the moment.
I wasn't gonna keep it at mine.

04:35.880 --> 04:39.200
You know if you're found out,
you'll go to prison.

04:41.480 --> 04:43.400
So, what do you want to do?

04:44.920 --> 04:46.240
Pay Adrian Cook a visit.

04:47.720 --> 04:50.120
Let's call by your neighbors'
on the way.

04:57.520 --> 04:59.959
Okay, get somebody
out the back.

04:59.960 --> 05:02.520
Oh, and bag this laptop.

05:17.240 --> 05:22.719
Boss, um, Sarah is not
at Roscoe's flat and...

05:22.720 --> 05:25.120
I can't see any sign
that she was ever held here.

05:26.680 --> 05:29.839
Okay, Vivienne.
Thanks for looking.

05:29.840 --> 05:32.040
Yeah, okay.

05:33.680 --> 05:35.479
You'd better hope
she never finds out

05:35.480 --> 05:36.720
what you've been up to.

05:38.400 --> 05:41.039
This is Vivienne
we're talking about.

05:41.040 --> 05:44.000
She won't turn a blind eye.

06:07.920 --> 06:11.679
Petra, can you tell me
when you last saw your husband?

06:11.680 --> 06:13.519
Yesterday morning.

06:13.520 --> 06:17.079
Early.
Before we both went out to work.

06:17.080 --> 06:20.799
You weren't concerned when
he didn't come home last night?

06:20.800 --> 06:23.719
I left him
a couple of messages.

06:23.720 --> 06:27.320
I just assumed
he was busy working.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.080
Do you recognize this woman?

06:40.640 --> 06:42.199
No.

06:42.200 --> 06:45.159
Never seen her
in Danny's company?

06:45.160 --> 06:47.319
Never.

06:47.320 --> 06:50.600
I-Is she something to do
with what happened to him?

06:52.320 --> 06:54.720
That's what we're trying
to find out.

06:58.920 --> 07:00.560
Let's see it.

07:05.400 --> 07:07.639
You're certain we'll find Adrian
Cook's prints and DNA on it?

07:07.640 --> 07:09.719
- A hundred percent.
- Okay.

07:09.720 --> 07:11.520
I'll send you a text.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.799
Mr. Bradford.
How can I help you?

07:47.800 --> 07:51.359
Talk to me
about Danny Roscoe.

07:51.360 --> 07:54.160
That constable of yours
has got a big mouth.

07:55.120 --> 07:57.359
All I want to do
is find my wife.

07:57.360 --> 07:59.800
I don't care about
anything else.

08:01.920 --> 08:02.960
Please.

08:08.840 --> 08:11.319
So Roscoe had seen Sarah.

08:11.320 --> 08:15.079
Why would that mean
he'd come into money? Hmm?

08:15.080 --> 08:16.799
I don't know.

08:16.800 --> 08:18.119
When he lost yet again,

08:18.120 --> 08:19.999
I told him
I was canceling his credit,

08:20.000 --> 08:22.680
and that's when he told me
all the stuff about your wife.

08:22.880 --> 08:24.319
I'll need the hard drive.

08:24.320 --> 08:27.799
Ah. Well, that would leave me
without CCTV.

08:27.800 --> 08:31.119
Danny Roscoe was found dead
this morning.

08:31.120 --> 08:33.279
This is a murder inquiry.

08:33.280 --> 08:34.438
Nothing to do with me.

08:34.440 --> 08:36.960
Nothing ever is.

09:34.760 --> 09:36.839
We suspect our murder victim
was a thief.

09:36.840 --> 09:38.399
How come?

09:38.400 --> 09:41.519
The sarge recovered a laptop
from Danny Roscoe's flat.

09:41.520 --> 09:42.959
We checked the serial number,

09:42.960 --> 09:44.879
and it was reported stolen
six weeks ago

09:44.880 --> 09:46.239
from an address in Hackney.

09:46.240 --> 09:48.519
I contacted the owners.

09:48.520 --> 09:50.519
Guess who drove them
to the theater that night.

09:50.520 --> 09:53.199
Don't tell me.
Danny Roscoe.

09:53.200 --> 09:57.279
It's highly unlikely
that Sarah hailed Roscoe's cab.

09:57.280 --> 09:58.999
So, what if he came across her

09:59.000 --> 10:00.599
when he was
breaking and entering?

10:00.600 --> 10:01.999
It's possible.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.159
What did Roscoe's wife
have to say for herself?

10:04.160 --> 10:05.479
Not a lot.

10:05.480 --> 10:06.879
She was hardly likely

10:06.880 --> 10:08.759
to fess up to the fact
that he was a thief.

10:08.760 --> 10:11.239
No.
I reckon I've been played.

10:11.240 --> 10:14.119
Do you mind if I have
another crack at her?

10:14.120 --> 10:16.880
Sure. Take Vivienne with you
for added muscle.

10:23.440 --> 10:25.799
This is my sergeant,
Vivienne Cole.

10:25.800 --> 10:28.039
I'm very sorry for your loss,
Mrs. Roscoe.

10:28.040 --> 10:30.679
Well, it didn't stop you lot
turning the place over.

10:30.680 --> 10:33.239
Look, we just want to find out
who attacked your husband.

10:33.240 --> 10:35.719
Who killed him, you mean?

10:35.720 --> 10:37.600
Did you recognize this?

10:39.600 --> 10:41.079
It looked like
the one Danny had.

10:41.080 --> 10:42.480
It's an expensive
piece of kit.

10:43.400 --> 10:45.399
Yeah, Danny bought it
off a mate.

10:45.400 --> 10:46.400
Which mate?

10:47.640 --> 10:50.280
Have you got a name
or an address you could give us?

10:51.400 --> 10:53.119
I don't remember.

10:53.120 --> 10:56.400
This laptop has been
reported stolen.

10:57.360 --> 11:00.399
Are you saying that my Danny
bought a dodgy laptop?

11:00.400 --> 11:02.999
I need to inform you
that we believe

11:03.000 --> 11:05.800
that this laptop
was stolen by your husband.

11:07.840 --> 11:11.359
Get out.
Get out of my house!

11:11.360 --> 11:12.719
Petra, we understand
you're upset.

11:12.720 --> 11:14.679
He's not been dead a day
and you,

11:14.680 --> 11:16.559
you're accusing him
of being a thief.

11:16.560 --> 11:17.879
I want you out!

11:17.880 --> 11:19.800
- Mrs. Roscoe...
- Get out of my house!

11:25.280 --> 11:27.119
Do you think she's gonna
make a complaint?

11:27.120 --> 11:29.399
Oh, let her try.

11:29.400 --> 11:31.239
Whatever her husband was doing,

11:31.240 --> 11:34.360
I guarantee you
she was up to her neck in it.

11:59.080 --> 12:00.440
Dad?

12:01.880 --> 12:03.040
Dad?

12:19.960 --> 12:23.319
I ran Petra's name and date
of birth through the system.

12:23.320 --> 12:25.159
There was police contact
with her when she was 15.

12:25.160 --> 12:26.279
Why?

12:26.280 --> 12:27.719
Her dad, Tony Pearce,

12:27.720 --> 12:29.439
went to prison
for high-value burglary.

12:29.440 --> 12:32.519
So Danny Roscoe
married into the family firm.

12:32.520 --> 12:33.520
Mm-hmm.

12:34.480 --> 12:36.320
Where does her dad live?

12:54.080 --> 12:57.679
Hello, Petra.
What's in those boxes?

12:57.680 --> 12:59.680
I want to talk
to my solicitor.

13:07.640 --> 13:09.559
Yesterday lunchtime
Danny told me

13:09.560 --> 13:12.479
that during the course
of a burglary yesterday morning

13:12.480 --> 13:14.039
he had come across a woman

13:14.040 --> 13:17.479
who he believed to be
held captive for some time.

13:17.480 --> 13:20.399
He was convinced that this woman
was the wife

13:20.400 --> 13:22.999
of Detective Inspector
David Bradford.

13:23.000 --> 13:27.439
He had seen her disappearance
reported on the news.

13:27.440 --> 13:30.679
I begged Danny
to call the police.

13:30.680 --> 13:32.599
To think of what that...
That poor woman

13:32.600 --> 13:34.439
and her family
have been through.

13:34.440 --> 13:37.359
But... But he was
rough with me.

13:37.360 --> 13:40.119
So instead
he was planning to blackmail

13:40.120 --> 13:42.039
Sarah Bradford's captor

13:42.040 --> 13:44.799
into giving him £5,000
to keep quiet.

13:44.800 --> 13:48.159
Did Danny tell you
who was holding Sarah Bradford?

13:48.160 --> 13:49.279
- No.
- Or where?

13:49.280 --> 13:50.520
No.

13:53.400 --> 13:56.879
I used CCTV to track
Danny Roscoe's journey

13:56.880 --> 13:58.319
to the murder site.

13:58.320 --> 14:02.919
Mobile ANPR picks up his cab
on Eulford Road

14:02.920 --> 14:05.199
at 22:18 last night.

14:05.200 --> 14:06.759
Then I did a convoy check,

14:06.760 --> 14:12.679
and a red estate car
rendezvouses with Danny's cab

14:12.680 --> 14:14.319
at an industrial site
in Charlton.

14:14.320 --> 14:16.400
Presumably checking
they weren't being followed.

14:17.680 --> 14:22.359
The estate then follows the cab
for a further 15 minutes.

14:22.360 --> 14:24.519
Can you I.D. the estate car?

14:24.520 --> 14:27.919
I can. Phoebe Ingram
is the registered keeper.

14:27.920 --> 14:30.279
41 years old.
Originally from North Wales.

14:30.280 --> 14:31.919
Moved to London in 1990.

14:31.920 --> 14:35.039
And she's got a nice big house.

14:35.040 --> 14:37.840
The sort of house Danny Roscoe
would love to burgle.

15:12.120 --> 15:14.080
Boss?

15:41.040 --> 15:42.360
He was all on his own.

16:00.640 --> 16:03.240
I found this under the bed
in the basement bedroom.

16:09.040 --> 16:10.800
It's Sarah's.
I'm sure of it.

16:11.800 --> 16:13.839
That means she was
definitely held here.

16:13.840 --> 16:15.440
It looks like it.

16:16.920 --> 16:19.439
One of the glass panes
in the back door was broken.

16:19.440 --> 16:21.559
Presumably that's how
Danny Roscoe broke in.

16:21.560 --> 16:24.200
And came face to face
with Sarah.

16:26.440 --> 16:30.159
What I don't understand is,
if this is Phoebe Ingram's baby,

16:30.160 --> 16:31.320
where's she?

16:50.560 --> 16:51.999
What?

16:52.000 --> 16:53.839
Don't let David in.

16:53.840 --> 16:55.839
Get a SOCO team down here
straightaway,

16:55.840 --> 16:58.160
and keep
the detective inspector out.

17:10.359 --> 17:12.479
Is it Sarah?

17:12.480 --> 17:16.079
I'm sorry, David,
I-I couldn't tell.

17:16.079 --> 17:17.960
They're gonna fast-track
an I.D.

17:21.599 --> 17:23.878
The dead woman was wearing
a couple of rings.

17:23.880 --> 17:25.999
SOCO let me take a photo.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.400
Are you up for taking a look?

17:36.800 --> 17:38.759
Those aren't Sarah's rings.

17:38.760 --> 17:40.119
Are you sure?

17:40.120 --> 17:43.000
I know what my wife's rings
look like.

17:46.480 --> 17:47.839
I'm sorry.

17:47.840 --> 17:50.400
No, I'm sorry.
It was a stupid question.

17:55.240 --> 17:57.159
So maybe it isn't Sarah.

17:57.160 --> 17:59.959
She's been missing for months.

17:59.960 --> 18:01.519
Just because she's wearing
different jewelry

18:01.520 --> 18:02.760
doesn't mean it's not his wife.

18:04.920 --> 18:05.960
And he knows that.

18:18.160 --> 18:19.759
None of the neighbors
have laid eyes

18:19.760 --> 18:21.799
on Phoebe Ingram for months.

18:21.800 --> 18:24.240
So she could be
the body in the freezer.

18:25.880 --> 18:27.679
Who's the boy?

18:27.680 --> 18:30.679
Her brother, Philip Ingram.
He's now 34 years old.

18:30.680 --> 18:32.999
And the neighbors have seen him
go in and out.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.239
Phoebe and Philip's dad
walked out years ago,

18:35.240 --> 18:37.279
and their mother died
when Philip was nine.

18:37.280 --> 18:39.360
What I can't find
is any record of a baby.

18:40.320 --> 18:42.119
That is properly strange.

18:42.120 --> 18:44.839
So if it is Phoebe Ingram
in the freezer,

18:44.840 --> 18:46.839
maybe her brother's
got Sarah.

18:46.840 --> 18:48.399
Makes sense.

18:48.400 --> 18:50.439
We've got her car details.

18:50.440 --> 18:52.680
Yeah, they're being circulated.
We'll find it.

19:59.560 --> 20:02.440
I'm sorry, Sarah.

20:09.840 --> 20:11.679
Adrian Cook's been picked up.

20:11.680 --> 20:13.399
He's gonna accuse us
of fitting him up.

20:13.400 --> 20:15.519
He hasn't a shred of proof.

20:15.520 --> 20:17.280
Act surprised.

20:27.640 --> 20:29.119
I thought you'd both
like to know...

20:29.120 --> 20:31.439
Adrian Cook's been arrested.

20:31.440 --> 20:32.719
What for?

20:32.720 --> 20:34.359
Possession of a firearm

20:34.360 --> 20:38.359
and conspiracy to murder
Marcus and Callum Maguire.

20:38.360 --> 20:42.000
The National Crime Agency found
a gun hidden at his casino.

20:44.080 --> 20:46.479
We suspected he provided
the murder weapon.

20:46.480 --> 20:47.679
Looks like we were right.

20:47.680 --> 20:49.639
The NCA were acting
on a tip-off

20:49.640 --> 20:51.360
from a confidential informant.

20:54.160 --> 20:56.640
I'll let you know
if there's any more details.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.920
Well, that's a turn-up
for the books.

21:03.480 --> 21:06.239
Why would Cook stash the gun
on his own premises?

21:06.240 --> 21:07.440
He knew
we were looking for it.

21:09.280 --> 21:10.280
Billie Fitzgerald.

21:10.281 --> 21:12.239
Yeah, Billie's right.

21:12.240 --> 21:14.120
Adrian Cook wouldn't be
that stupid.

21:15.800 --> 21:18.999
Phoebe Ingram's car's been
spotted on ANPR in Hackney

21:19.000 --> 21:20.119
traveling south.

21:20.120 --> 21:21.399
I reckon
it's heading back home.

21:21.400 --> 21:22.800
Somebody should tell the boss.

21:26.400 --> 21:28.319
If we get a shift on,
we can get there first.

21:28.320 --> 21:30.319
Call for backup,
but I don't want anyone else

21:30.320 --> 21:32.079
intercepting this.

21:32.080 --> 21:34.720
Control from D.C. Brady.

21:38.120 --> 21:40.760
Okay.
Thanks Vivienne.

21:43.760 --> 21:46.999
It was Phoebe Ingram
in the freezer.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.200
So it's got to be her brother
driving the car, then.

21:51.240 --> 21:52.440
Boss.

22:27.560 --> 22:29.120
Police!

22:37.160 --> 22:38.160
Aah!

22:38.161 --> 22:40.119
- Where's Sarah?!
- No!

22:40.120 --> 22:41.559
Where is my wife?!

22:41.560 --> 22:42.959
Back off!

22:42.960 --> 22:45.080
Back off, sir.

22:51.200 --> 22:52.879
You all right, Philip?

22:52.880 --> 22:55.879
Okay, Philip, it's okay.
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

22:55.880 --> 22:56.920
All right?

22:59.280 --> 23:02.440
We just need to know
that Sarah's all right.

23:03.960 --> 23:06.279
I took her back
to where I found her.

23:06.280 --> 23:07.599
Where's that, Philip?

23:07.600 --> 23:09.880
I took her back
to where I found her.

23:16.840 --> 23:18.279
Philip Ingram's being assessed

23:18.280 --> 23:19.599
to see
if he's fit for interview.

23:19.600 --> 23:21.919
It's a slow process,
as we all know.

23:21.920 --> 23:25.040
Yeah, and meanwhile
Sarah's God knows where.

23:26.240 --> 23:27.679
What do we know about
this guy?

23:27.680 --> 23:30.199
Uh, well,
after their mum died,

23:30.200 --> 23:32.799
the older sister, Phoebe,
she brought Philip up.

23:32.800 --> 23:34.679
And what was Phoebe's
cause of death?

23:34.680 --> 23:37.239
The pathologist reckons
it was a bleed-out

23:37.240 --> 23:40.519
as a result of a mishandled
birth about five months ago.

23:40.520 --> 23:42.799
Which explains the baby.

23:42.800 --> 23:46.639
Yeah, um, the mum left them
a substantial sum.

23:46.640 --> 23:48.199
Phoebe did some voluntary work,

23:48.200 --> 23:50.079
but Philip's never
held down a job.

23:50.080 --> 23:51.919
Because of
his mental health issues?

23:51.920 --> 23:54.639
Yeah, at the age of 12
he was excluded from school

23:54.640 --> 23:57.160
for repeated violent outbursts.

23:58.360 --> 24:00.199
So then the sister
homeschooled him,

24:00.200 --> 24:04.039
and it seems to me
she cut him off from the world.

24:04.040 --> 24:06.599
This was found in one of
Petra Roscoe's boxes.

24:06.600 --> 24:08.200
There's no Sim card.

24:12.560 --> 24:14.279
It certainly
looks like Sarah's.

24:14.280 --> 24:17.119
I've charged it,
but I need the passcode.

24:17.120 --> 24:20.119
Oh. Um...

24:20.120 --> 24:22.519
It's Carly's birthday.
July 7.

24:22.520 --> 24:24.239
0707.

24:24.240 --> 24:25.960
Yep.

24:29.760 --> 24:33.119
Sarah's phone hasn't been used
since the day she went missing,

24:33.120 --> 24:36.239
so there's nothing new
in calls, texts, or GPS.

24:36.240 --> 24:39.479
What is new are the photos
Sarah saved to her hard drive,

24:39.480 --> 24:41.639
not the cloud.

24:41.640 --> 24:43.440
Have you any idea
what this is?

24:48.880 --> 24:50.559
Liam.

24:50.560 --> 24:51.720
Who's Liam?

24:57.840 --> 25:00.640
Last year,
Sarah and I lost a baby.

25:04.680 --> 25:09.039
He was stillborn.
Just under six months.

25:09.040 --> 25:10.919
I wasn't there
when it happened.

25:10.920 --> 25:15.359
I was on a covert op, so Sarah
couldn't get hold of me.

25:15.360 --> 25:19.280
It hit her
really, really hard.

25:20.240 --> 25:22.599
She called him Liam.

25:22.600 --> 25:25.119
I didn't know
she'd done this.

25:25.120 --> 25:26.879
Buried him?

25:26.880 --> 25:28.159
No.

25:28.160 --> 25:30.679
No, the hospital
took care of all of that.

25:30.680 --> 25:33.079
I'm sure
it's just a memorial.

25:33.080 --> 25:35.720
That's Sarah's parents' grave.

25:36.600 --> 25:38.399
This photograph was taken

25:38.400 --> 25:40.079
on the day
that Sarah went missing,

25:40.080 --> 25:42.840
two hours after
she was last seen.

25:46.760 --> 25:48.359
Philip Ingram
said he was taking Sarah

25:48.360 --> 25:49.600
back to where he found her.

26:04.120 --> 26:05.920
What's been
going on recently?

26:06.760 --> 26:08.119
Sorry?

26:08.120 --> 26:10.840
With you and Rob
and the detective inspector?

26:13.200 --> 26:15.599
Do you really think
I hadn't noticed?

26:15.600 --> 26:18.480
Rob and I had got
the wrong end of the stick.

26:23.480 --> 26:25.839
David wasn't
where he said he was

26:25.840 --> 26:27.239
on the night
that his wife went missing.

26:27.240 --> 26:28.559
What, and you thought
he had something...

26:28.560 --> 26:31.320
Yeah, and now I feel
ashamed at myself.

26:33.200 --> 26:37.160
You know, he said
I wasn't a team player.

26:38.640 --> 26:40.640
Maybe he's right.

26:45.840 --> 26:48.519
You didn't mention
that Sarah was pregnant.

26:48.520 --> 26:50.639
We didn't tell anyone.

26:50.640 --> 26:52.679
She'd miscarried before.

26:52.680 --> 26:55.280
It was six months.
You must have thought...

26:56.880 --> 26:59.600
Sarah accused me
of not really wanting a child.

27:01.360 --> 27:02.880
She was wrong.

27:03.800 --> 27:05.240
You could've talked to me.

27:20.840 --> 27:23.519
It's years
since I've been here.

27:23.520 --> 27:25.719
Sarah's mum's funeral.

27:25.720 --> 27:27.679
Can you remember
where the grave is?

27:27.680 --> 27:30.199
This place is massive.

27:30.200 --> 27:32.480
Somewhere up here, I think.

28:11.360 --> 28:14.159
I see something.

28:14.160 --> 28:16.000
Could that be Sarah?

28:21.680 --> 28:23.240
It's her!

28:24.360 --> 28:26.239
She's breathing.

28:26.240 --> 28:27.920
Sarah?

28:28.000 --> 28:29.759
Sarah?

28:29.760 --> 28:31.919
I think he must have drugged
her. Call for an ambulance.

28:31.920 --> 28:35.359
- T.D.C. Fitzgerald to control.
- Go ahead.

28:35.360 --> 28:37.719
We need an ambulance
to St. Cardus Cemetery.

28:37.720 --> 28:39.520
Received.

28:40.680 --> 28:43.400
Stay with me, Sarah.

28:52.680 --> 28:54.519
- Boss.
- Billie.

28:54.520 --> 28:56.039
We found her.

28:56.040 --> 28:58.080
She's at the grave.
She's alive.

28:59.480 --> 29:01.559
Thank God.

29:01.560 --> 29:03.040
They found her?

29:04.080 --> 29:06.160
Where are you exactly?

29:21.440 --> 29:24.880
They're on their way.
All right?

29:49.800 --> 29:52.199
They really want to know
what Ingram's given her.

29:52.200 --> 29:55.839
Billie, find out if Ingram's
sister was on any kind of meds.

29:55.840 --> 29:57.440
Will do.

30:00.240 --> 30:01.800
Look at that.

30:03.520 --> 30:06.280
That's Philip Ingram's mother.

30:07.720 --> 30:10.040
So that's how she met him,
then.

30:32.040 --> 30:35.600
Carly.
It's Dad.

30:37.640 --> 30:39.400
We've found your mum.

30:41.920 --> 30:44.280
Yeah, she's with
the doctors now.

30:48.840 --> 30:51.120
Wish you weren't so far away.

30:55.240 --> 30:57.040
Yeah, we'll get you home.

30:59.960 --> 31:02.719
I tracked down
Phoebe Ingram's G.P.

31:02.720 --> 31:05.439
Phoebe had an accident
a couple of years back.

31:05.440 --> 31:07.439
She was on serious
pain medication.

31:07.440 --> 31:09.879
So maybe that's what
he's given Sarah.

31:09.880 --> 31:11.479
Have you let the hospital know?

31:11.480 --> 31:12.559
Yeah, I've just
phoned it through.

31:12.560 --> 31:13.560
Great.

31:13.561 --> 31:16.040
Rob?
Can I have a word?

31:27.720 --> 31:30.439
I've just heard off the record
that Adrian Cook

31:30.440 --> 31:31.920
is threatening
to make a complaint.

31:33.040 --> 31:37.319
He's alleging that the detective
inspector shut down his CCTV

31:37.320 --> 31:40.240
so that you could
plant the gun in the casino.

31:41.800 --> 31:43.079
He's desperate.

31:43.080 --> 31:45.399
He's also saying
that it was him

31:45.400 --> 31:47.759
that gave you the tip-off
about Danny Roscoe

31:47.760 --> 31:50.239
in return for you turning
a blind eye to the fact

31:50.240 --> 31:55.639
that he supplied a firearm
used in a double murder.

31:55.640 --> 31:58.919
You wouldn't do anything that
stupid, now, would you, Rob?

31:58.920 --> 32:00.400
Of course not.

32:18.760 --> 32:20.040
Mr. Cook.

32:21.200 --> 32:23.719
- Good to see you again.
- Ha ha ha.

32:23.720 --> 32:27.639
So word is that you're about
to be charged with

32:27.640 --> 32:31.239
conspiracy to murder
and possession of a firearm.

32:31.240 --> 32:33.199
I've been fitted up.

32:33.200 --> 32:37.879
Oh, and yet forensics
have come back

32:37.880 --> 32:40.439
showing your fingermarks
on the gun,

32:40.440 --> 32:42.640
and your DNA.

32:47.040 --> 32:48.879
So let me get this right...

32:48.880 --> 32:51.559
You're not denying
handling the gun,

32:51.560 --> 32:53.039
you're just complaining
about the manner

32:53.040 --> 32:54.519
in which
the police found it?

32:54.520 --> 32:56.119
See, I don't think
that's gonna go down

32:56.120 --> 32:57.920
very well with the judge.

33:00.200 --> 33:01.879
Doesn't your mate Rob Brady

33:01.880 --> 33:04.400
understand the concept
of a deal?

33:06.760 --> 33:10.719
We don't do deals,
Mr. Cook.

33:10.720 --> 33:12.920
You should know that by now.

33:59.160 --> 34:00.560
David.

34:07.040 --> 34:08.839
Where's Carly?

34:08.840 --> 34:11.039
Carly's fine.

34:11.040 --> 34:13.438
She's on her way back
from France.

34:13.440 --> 34:16.320
She's been on a school trip.

34:20.920 --> 34:23.639
I can't tell you
how much I've missed you.

34:33.159 --> 34:37.639
Lucy is here to act as your
appropriate adult today, Philip.

34:37.639 --> 34:39.799
If there's anything
you don't understand,

34:39.800 --> 34:42.599
you can ask Lucy,
and she'll explain it for you.

34:42.600 --> 34:45.080
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay?

34:47.560 --> 34:50.560
Can you tell me
about the baby, Philip?

34:51.639 --> 34:53.159
His name's Rhys?

34:53.159 --> 34:56.599
Phoebe met a man,
the man stayed the night,

34:56.600 --> 34:58.879
and then we had Rhys.

34:58.880 --> 35:01.039
Did Phoebe have the baby
in hospital?

35:01.040 --> 35:03.479
No.
At home.

35:03.480 --> 35:05.239
And did you help?

35:05.240 --> 35:08.479
I tried,
but after Rhys was born,

35:08.480 --> 35:09.960
Phoebe stopped breathing.

35:11.800 --> 35:13.839
Did you call an ambulance?

35:13.840 --> 35:15.479
No.

35:15.480 --> 35:17.039
Why not?

35:17.040 --> 35:20.120
Phoebe doesn't want me
to talk to people like that.

35:23.200 --> 35:26.680
When Phoebe stopped breathing,
what did you do?

35:29.000 --> 35:32.319
I put her in the freezer
like they do on the telly,

35:32.320 --> 35:35.560
and she's safe then
till she wakes up.

35:42.840 --> 35:46.480
I made a memorial
for our son.

35:47.760 --> 35:50.080
I saw it.

35:51.640 --> 35:54.400
I went to the graveyard
to think.

35:57.440 --> 35:59.160
And he was there.

36:01.200 --> 36:02.960
Philip?

36:03.840 --> 36:06.319
When he told me he was trying
to look after a baby,

36:06.320 --> 36:08.440
my heart went out to him.

36:12.040 --> 36:16.159
How did Sarah end up
coming to stay at your house?

36:16.160 --> 36:20.759
I went to my mum's grave,
and Sarah was there.

36:20.760 --> 36:22.840
Like an angel.

36:23.120 --> 36:25.920
She told me that her baby
had died.

36:29.080 --> 36:32.719
What happened?
That night.

36:32.720 --> 36:34.960
Before you met Philip Ingram.

36:38.240 --> 36:40.480
I followed you.

36:41.520 --> 36:45.000
And I saw you.

36:45.880 --> 36:48.039
With a woman and a child.

36:48.040 --> 36:49.840
It was work.

36:51.240 --> 36:53.600
Her name is Grace.

36:54.760 --> 36:56.959
She's a witness...
An informant...

36:56.960 --> 36:58.600
In a highly sensitive
investigation.

37:07.200 --> 37:08.439
Okay.

37:08.440 --> 37:10.280
Stay there.

37:20.240 --> 37:25.119
Philip asked me
to go back to the house,

37:25.120 --> 37:28.400
just to talk about things
he might need for the baby.

37:33.040 --> 37:35.000
It felt good.

37:36.840 --> 37:39.639
Looking after baby Rhys.

37:39.640 --> 37:41.520
Punishing you.

37:44.600 --> 37:46.800
But just for a moment.

37:50.720 --> 37:54.680
I told Philip I had to go home,
and he wouldn't let me go.

37:56.640 --> 38:00.160
And the next thing I knew,
I was waking up in a cellar.

38:01.760 --> 38:04.839
He's a big lad.

38:04.840 --> 38:08.520
It wasn't hard for him
to stop me leaving.

38:10.600 --> 38:12.320
It was like
having Phoebe back again.

38:16.920 --> 38:19.000
Tell us about this man.

38:27.160 --> 38:31.799
He broke into our house, and he
took Phoebe's favorite statue.

38:31.800 --> 38:34.080
Where were you
when he broke in?

38:35.440 --> 38:37.800
At the shops getting food.

38:39.880 --> 38:44.199
I spent most of the time
with the baby

38:44.200 --> 38:46.000
in that cellar.

38:47.440 --> 38:50.640
Yesterday morning
I was half asleep.

38:52.040 --> 38:53.720
Philip was out.

38:54.920 --> 38:56.279
I heard a noise.

38:56.280 --> 39:00.039
I knew it wasn't Philip,
so I called out.

39:00.040 --> 39:03.399
His name
was Danny Roscoe.

39:03.400 --> 39:08.519
I called out to him that I was
being held against my will.

39:08.520 --> 39:11.959
He tried to open the door,
but it was padlocked.

39:11.960 --> 39:15.039
When I told him who I was,

39:15.040 --> 39:18.400
he promised
he would get help.

39:21.920 --> 39:23.400
And what happened next?

39:25.640 --> 39:27.439
I came home,

39:27.440 --> 39:29.439
and Sarah started screaming
at me,

39:29.440 --> 39:31.319
telling me
that I had to let her go.

39:31.320 --> 39:33.840
So I gave her the medicine
to make her sleepy.

39:37.280 --> 39:41.559
How did you arrange
to meet Danny Roscoe?

39:41.560 --> 39:43.479
Shecalled.

39:43.480 --> 39:46.399
She?
A woman?

39:46.400 --> 39:47.440
Mm-hmm.

39:48.880 --> 39:50.920
Was it his wife?

39:53.760 --> 39:54.880
Yeah.

39:56.200 --> 39:59.079
Okay, we'll be having
some serious words with her.

39:59.080 --> 40:02.160
What did she say?

40:03.080 --> 40:05.079
She said
I had to meet the robber,

40:05.080 --> 40:08.319
give him £5,000,
or they'd tell the police,

40:08.320 --> 40:11.120
and they'd take Sarah
away from me.

40:12.080 --> 40:13.480
And what happened
when you met him?

40:14.480 --> 40:17.239
He had Phoebe's statue.

40:17.240 --> 40:19.600
He said it was rubbish
and that he couldn't sell it.

40:21.720 --> 40:23.520
He threw it on the ground.

40:27.640 --> 40:30.200
I don't have £5,000.

40:32.920 --> 40:34.120
And what did you do?

40:35.840 --> 40:37.119
I picked it up.

40:37.120 --> 40:39.399
I hit him over the head
with it.

40:39.400 --> 40:41.520
I wanted him to be quiet.

40:43.960 --> 40:46.959
Where's the statue now, Philip?

40:46.960 --> 40:48.360
It's in the hall.

40:52.520 --> 40:57.199
All this... this
insane thing that's happened,

40:57.200 --> 40:59.920
it's... it's not your fault.

41:23.600 --> 41:26.600
David, it's me.
Call me back.

41:27.520 --> 41:28.919
Or better still,
just get over here.

41:28.920 --> 41:31.919
I think
that someone's outside.

41:31.920 --> 41:33.840
I'm frightened.

41:36.680 --> 41:39.439
That cellar that I was in,

41:39.440 --> 41:41.959
Phoebe used to
lock Philip in there

41:41.960 --> 41:43.760
when she couldn't
control him.

41:45.960 --> 41:47.359
What'll happen to him?

41:47.360 --> 41:49.440
There's no way
he's fit to plead.

41:52.000 --> 41:53.960
I can't believe
you're not angry.

42:00.360 --> 42:01.520
I love you.

42:15.040 --> 42:17.040
I'm gonna be just outside.

42:29.400 --> 42:31.999
David, it's me.
Call me back.

42:32.000 --> 42:33.320
Better still,
just get over here.

42:40.760 --> 42:43.879
Grace, I got your message.

42:43.880 --> 42:45.559
I can't get away right now,

42:45.560 --> 42:47.959
but I'll send 'round
someone you can trust.

42:47.960 --> 42:50.280
Don't worry.

42:57.896 --> 43:00.775
Adrian Cook hasn't made
a complaint.

43:00.776 --> 43:02.696
Rumor has it
Vivienne had a word.

43:03.896 --> 43:07.095
Listen, I need a favor.

43:07.096 --> 43:08.855
I shouldn't be telling you
any of this,

43:08.856 --> 43:11.616
but I can't leave Sarah
on her own, not again.

43:12.576 --> 43:14.935
The woman I was with
the night Sarah disappeared

43:14.936 --> 43:16.295
wasn't my girlfriend.

43:16.296 --> 43:18.895
Grace Harper
is under police protection.

43:18.896 --> 43:22.015
She's a witness in a highly
sensitive undercover inquiry.

43:22.016 --> 43:23.655
That's why
I couldn't be honest

43:23.656 --> 43:25.735
about where I was
and what I was doing.

43:25.736 --> 43:27.015
So why tell me now?

43:27.016 --> 43:29.135
I'm Grace's handler.

43:29.136 --> 43:31.335
She's just left me a message
saying she's frightened,

43:31.336 --> 43:33.575
and now she's not
answering her phone.

43:33.576 --> 43:35.335
Do you want me
to go 'round there?

43:35.336 --> 43:36.816
Please.

43:49.071 --> 43:51.001
Thanks.
For everything you did.

43:51.514 --> 43:52.598
We're just
so happy.

43:53.521 --> 43:54.521
Sorry.

43:54.757 --> 43:56.317
It's finally over.

43:57.877 --> 44:00.756
You got her back.

44:00.757 --> 44:02.997
I still can't quite believe it.

44:55.693 --> 44:56.933
Grace?

44:58.853 --> 45:01.572
It's Detective Constable
Rob Brady.

45:01.573 --> 45:03.893
David Bradford sent me.

45:05.133 --> 45:06.773
Grace?

45:13.653 --> 45:15.612
You all right, mate?

45:15.613 --> 45:17.053
All right, then?

45:28.133 --> 45:29.372
Rob.

45:29.373 --> 45:33.012
David,
I know you're with Sarah,

45:33.013 --> 45:35.932
but you need
to know something.

45:35.933 --> 45:37.573
Grace Harper's dead.
