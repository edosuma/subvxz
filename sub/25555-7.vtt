Previously
on "Floribama Shore"...

00:05.971 --> 00:08.308
{\an7}Just, some red flags
have come up about Logan.

00:08.375 --> 00:10.377
{\an8}(Candace)
He's psycho. It's scary.

00:10.443 --> 00:12.712
{\an8}I think Kortni is going to
continue brushing off

00:12.779 --> 00:16.315
{\an8}the red flags with Logan
until something major happens.

00:16.383 --> 00:17.617
{\an7}What?

00:16.383 --> 00:17.617
{\an8}(Gator)
<i>Guess what?</i>

00:17.684 --> 00:19.486
{\an8}<i>I'm gonna see you</i>
<i>tomorrow.</i>

00:19.552 --> 00:21.321
{\an7}Aah!

00:21.388 --> 00:24.491
{\an8}Let's hope I don't
forget his full name.

00:21.388 --> 00:24.491
{\an7}(Gus)
Gatorade?

00:24.557 --> 00:28.194
{\an7}GatorJay.

00:24.557 --> 00:28.194
{\an8}I'm not calling a
grown-ass man that.
I'm sorry.

00:28.261 --> 00:29.329
{\an8}I'm not calling
any man a god.

00:29.396 --> 00:31.831
{\an8}I'm thinking
it's Skyler.

00:29.396 --> 00:31.831
{\an7}Or Ralph.

00:31.898 --> 00:34.200
{\an8}I'll just start
calling him Clarence.

00:34.267 --> 00:35.568

{\an1}Candace, come here.
I just want you to know

01:03.730 --> 01:05.265
{\an5}that the boys aren't...

01:03.730 --> 01:05.265
What happened?

01:05.331 --> 01:07.767
{\an4}The boys aren't gonna
address Gator as GatorJay.
They're gonna...

01:07.834 --> 01:10.770
They said, "I'm not gonna
address a man like that."

01:13.807 --> 01:17.777
{\an3}(screaming)

01:17.844 --> 01:20.447
Mother(bleep),
who they talkin' 'bout?

01:20.513 --> 01:24.184
{\an8}I'm going down there now.

01:20.513 --> 01:24.184
{\an8}Uh-uh, uh-uh!

01:24.250 --> 01:26.653
{\an5}Might as well!

01:24.250 --> 01:26.653
{\an1}Wait, wait, wait!
Candace!

01:26.719 --> 01:29.322
{\an5}So it has been
brought to my attention
that you said,

01:29.389 --> 01:31.458
"I'm not gonna address
him as his name."

01:31.524 --> 01:34.994
{\an1}I'm not calling a grown man
GatorJay 5,000 Southside God.

01:35.061 --> 01:38.531
{\an4}I'm not calling anybody
a god because that's
disrespectful to God himself.

01:38.598 --> 01:40.166
It's GatorJay
231 Southside God.

01:40.233 --> 01:42.068
{\an4}I don't really care
what it-- I'm not
calling any man a god.

01:42.135 --> 01:43.636
But y'all could just
call him GatorJay.

01:43.703 --> 01:44.938
You could just call
him Gator.

01:45.004 --> 01:47.540
It doesn't matter.
You can call him Gator.

01:47.607 --> 01:49.242
{\an1}I'm just saying,
I'm not calling him Gator.

01:49.309 --> 01:52.045
{\an5}If everybody else can
address him as that,
that's his name.

01:52.111 --> 01:54.614
{\an8}I'm just thinking, like,
how petty can you be?

01:54.681 --> 01:56.816
The person I'm inviting
to this house who's excited

01:56.883 --> 01:58.785
to meet each and every one
of y'all

01:58.852 --> 02:00.920
and y'all
want to be childish

02:00.987 --> 02:03.623
{\an8}and make jokes about his name,
it's not okay with me.

02:03.690 --> 02:05.525
{\an1}So, for you to say, "Oh,
I'm gonna call him Clarence,"

02:05.592 --> 02:07.293
well, that's disrespectful.

02:07.360 --> 02:09.895
{\an4}(Jeremiah)
I said that, but I was
doing it in a jokingly manner.

02:09.963 --> 02:11.865
Okay, well, then, what are
you gonna call him? Daddy?

02:11.931 --> 02:13.933
{\an1}My thing was, I'm not
calling him Southside God.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.201
Are you (bleep) joking?

02:15.268 --> 02:16.603
I'll call him Daddy.

02:16.669 --> 02:18.738
{\an1}(Candace)
Oh, my God!

02:18.805 --> 02:20.840
{\an4}Why are you running upstairs
and just stirring the pot
is what I want to know.

02:20.907 --> 02:22.542
I'm not running upstairs,
stirring the pot.

02:22.609 --> 02:24.844
I want her to know
that I do have her back

02:24.911 --> 02:26.880
and my loyalty lies with her
because she is my friend.

02:26.946 --> 02:29.315
{\an5}If y'all said it,
y'all said it. Actually,
it's not stirring the pot,

02:29.382 --> 02:31.251
'cause y'all said it
and it got back to me.

02:31.317 --> 02:35.054
{\an4}Y'all are hella... Y'all are
some of the pettiest people
I have ever lived with...

02:35.121 --> 02:36.756
{\an4}Look who's talking,
darling.

02:35.121 --> 02:36.756
...in my entire life.

02:36.823 --> 02:39.058
{\an4}Look who's talking,
darling.

02:36.823 --> 02:39.058
I'm not petty.
I'm not petty.

02:39.125 --> 02:42.128
I told you my part. I said
I'm not calling him a god.

02:42.195 --> 02:44.130
Y'all mad immature and
that's just what it is.

02:44.197 --> 02:46.199
Well, we'll just see
when GatorJay gets here.

02:46.266 --> 02:48.835
{\an1}I'm immature
when I let you talk.

02:48.902 --> 02:51.404
{\an4}I'm immature
when I let you talk,
but when I go to talk,

02:51.471 --> 02:54.874
{\an4}you cut me off,
but I'm immature.

02:51.471 --> 02:54.874
Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya.

02:54.941 --> 02:56.276
Y'all are petty men.

02:56.342 --> 03:00.113
{\an1}You don't even deserve to
be called a woman, honestly.

03:02.515 --> 03:05.084
{\an1}Oh, thank you. I don't
deserve to be called a woman?

03:05.151 --> 03:06.753
{\an4}(Gus)
You really don't. When you
act like that, you don't.

03:06.819 --> 03:10.056
I don't deserve to be
called a woman? Really?

03:10.123 --> 03:12.659
{\an8}What Gus said was
so out of left field,

03:12.725 --> 03:13.893
like, I don't even know
where that came from.

03:13.960 --> 03:15.995
Gus, that was
too far, Gus.

03:16.062 --> 03:18.064
{\an1}What do I be called then?
Tell me.

03:18.131 --> 03:20.033
Nah, I'm good.
I'm good.

03:20.099 --> 03:23.336
{\an4}What am I?

03:20.099 --> 03:23.336
{\an5}I really don't even
know. I've never seen
anything like it.

03:23.403 --> 03:24.837
{\an4}(Candace)
Oh, you haven't seen
anything like it?

03:24.904 --> 03:26.906
{\an1}So I'm not even
a person now? I'm an it?

03:26.973 --> 03:29.409
Don't-- Don't put
those words in our mouth.

03:29.475 --> 03:31.578
{\an1}You're full of it.
You're completely full of it.

03:31.644 --> 03:33.746
Okay, cool. That's good.

03:37.483 --> 03:39.152
You're a little (bleep).

03:39.218 --> 03:40.420
That's what the
(bleep) you are, bitch.

03:40.486 --> 03:42.922
{\an1}Good. That's what
I was going for. I love it.

03:42.989 --> 03:44.591
{\an5}But at the end of the day...

03:42.989 --> 03:44.591
{\an1}I love it.

03:44.657 --> 03:47.460
{\an5}...you're trying to say
that I'm not a woman
because I speak my mind?

03:47.527 --> 03:51.431
{\an5}That says a lot about
you and what you call
yourself as a man.

03:47.527 --> 03:51.431
You're a strong woman!

03:51.497 --> 03:56.736
Because I'm speaking my mind
on my guest's name,

03:56.803 --> 03:59.472
all of a sudden, I don't
deserve to be called a woman.

03:59.539 --> 04:01.274
They wouldn't do that
with Nilsa.

04:01.341 --> 04:02.709
They wouldn't
do that with Aimee.

04:02.775 --> 04:05.244
I know the boys don't like me.
I'm over it.

04:05.311 --> 04:07.280
You just told me
that I'm not a person.

04:07.347 --> 04:09.482
{\an1}I'm saying the women
in this house in general,

04:09.549 --> 04:12.418
they always come at the guys
saying, "You aren't even men.

04:12.485 --> 04:14.354
{\an5}Y'all aren't men
in this house."

04:12.485 --> 04:14.354
Because y'all act--

04:14.420 --> 04:17.423
{\an5}So, I say the same exact
thing and, oh, it's the
worst thing in the world?

04:17.490 --> 04:21.293
{\an5}No. Give me a break.

04:17.490 --> 04:21.293
Give me a beer
and pop some popcorn.

04:21.361 --> 04:25.665
{\an5}(Kortni)
Candace is screaming, the guys
are being disrespectful to her,

04:25.732 --> 04:28.334
{\an8}and I don't really want to hop
in and say anything, you know?

04:28.401 --> 04:29.902
{\an8}I'm just sitting back
and watching.

04:29.969 --> 04:35.141
I'm Switzerland.
I'm in the middle.

04:35.208 --> 04:38.611
Right? That's what
that means, I think.

04:38.678 --> 04:41.080
{\an5}(Candace)
I'm not a woman.
I'm such a monster.

04:41.147 --> 04:44.150
Gus had told me that I don't
deserve to be called a woman,

04:44.217 --> 04:46.653
and, you know, I asked him.
I'm like, well, I'm not a woman.

04:46.719 --> 04:50.123
You know, I'm not-- I've never
been a man, so I must be an it.

04:50.189 --> 04:52.291
So if I'm an it,
I guess I'm a monster.

04:52.358 --> 04:58.097
{\an5}So I'm gonna embrace my new
title as the ass(bleep) lying
monster that's not a woman.

{\an5}(Nilsa)
So, I had a great day today.
I don't know about y'all.

05:30.530 --> 05:33.800
{\an4}If you have a freaking
great day by stirring
the pot and starting

05:33.866 --> 05:38.004
{\an4}all these fights within
the house, that's your
definition of a great day

05:38.071 --> 05:41.307
{\an1}says a lot about you,
and I hope you heard me, Nilsa.

05:41.374 --> 05:43.176
{\an5}(Jeremiah)
I really do think Nilsa's
a snake in the grass.

05:43.242 --> 05:45.611
She continues to prove it
day in and day out,

05:45.678 --> 05:47.714
and the fact that she blew
something as simple

05:47.780 --> 05:50.683
{\an8}as us making little jokes
about Gator's name

05:50.750 --> 05:52.552
and blew it
way out of proportion

05:52.618 --> 05:54.020
and you saw
the way tonight went,

05:54.087 --> 05:56.656
yeah, I don't trust her
whatsoever.

05:56.723 --> 05:59.692
{\an4}And thank you for
having my back, Kortni.
Appreciate you, boo.

05:59.759 --> 06:01.294
No. What was just said?
I was just talking to him.

06:01.360 --> 06:03.096
{\an1}No, it's all good.
I'm not tripping, boo.

06:03.162 --> 06:05.098
{\an4}(Kortni)
But, no, why'd you say,
"thank you for having my back"?

06:05.164 --> 06:06.332
{\an1}She's saying
you don't have her back.

06:06.399 --> 06:07.867
{\an5}Yeah. Yeah.

06:06.399 --> 06:07.867
(Kortni)
For what?

06:07.934 --> 06:10.636
At the end of the day, Kortni is
my closest friend in the house,

06:10.703 --> 06:12.872
and I don't feel like
she had my back at all.

06:12.939 --> 06:14.974
Just to sit there
and not say anything...

06:15.041 --> 06:16.909
Like, I would never do that
if Kortni was arguing.

06:16.976 --> 06:19.946
{\an5}I would at least try
to get in the middle
and defuse the situation,

06:20.012 --> 06:21.647
and I don't feel like
she did that.

06:21.714 --> 06:23.082
{\an4}She knows you're in
the wrong. That's why she
doesn't have your back.

06:23.149 --> 06:25.818
{\an5}How am I in the wrong?

06:23.149 --> 06:25.818
Well, look how you're acting.

06:25.885 --> 06:26.986
{\an5}(Candace)
How am I acting?

06:25.885 --> 06:26.986
What did I do?

06:27.053 --> 06:28.054
What did I do?

06:28.121 --> 06:29.956
What the hell is happening?

06:30.022 --> 06:31.190
I didn't say you did
anything wrong.

06:31.257 --> 06:32.725
I said, "Thank you
for having my back."

06:32.792 --> 06:35.294
{\an5}That's what I said.

06:32.792 --> 06:35.294
{\an1}You're being sarcastic,
are you not?

06:35.361 --> 06:36.996
But what did I do?

06:37.063 --> 06:39.065
I'm not involved
in this at all,

06:39.132 --> 06:41.868
and somehow I'm getting
involved. Leave me alone.

06:41.934 --> 06:43.336
He just called me
an "it."

06:43.402 --> 06:45.838
{\an1}I wasn't listening to him.
I was talking to him.

06:45.905 --> 06:47.874
{\an5}Okay, Kortni, okay.

06:45.905 --> 06:47.874
My brain doesn't focus

06:47.940 --> 06:49.008
{\an1}on all y'all's (bleep)
at one time.

06:49.075 --> 06:54.080
Kortni. Okay, Kortni.
I... I...

06:54.147 --> 06:56.582
{\an1}All right, you don't
want to talk to me like that.

06:56.649 --> 06:58.184
Candace talks down to me.

06:58.251 --> 06:59.986
She's literally looking at me
like she has the devil in her

07:00.052 --> 07:03.723
{\an5}and I am like this
little girl that she's
trying to boss around.

07:03.790 --> 07:06.692
{\an5}You know what, Kortni?
I've been there for you
100% of the time.

07:06.759 --> 07:08.494
{\an5}Yeah, (bleep), you have!

07:06.759 --> 07:08.494
I've been there.

07:08.561 --> 07:10.997
{\an5}Every time people
come up against you,
I have your back, Kortni.

07:11.063 --> 07:14.700
So, you know what?
It's on, bitch.

07:14.767 --> 07:16.102
I don't want nothing
to do with that (bleep)

07:16.169 --> 07:17.270
because of the way
you (bleep) look at me

07:17.336 --> 07:18.638
and you (bleep)
disrespect me!

07:18.704 --> 07:20.206
{\an5}I didn't disrespect you.

07:18.704 --> 07:20.206
Yeah, I do have your back.

07:20.273 --> 07:24.477
{\an5}Yes, you did! You scared
me like I'm a piece
of (bleep) (bleep)

07:24.544 --> 07:27.346
and I won't do
a goddamn thing, Candace!

07:27.413 --> 07:29.282
{\an5}(Candace)
I said, "Thank you
for having my back."
That's what I said.

07:29.348 --> 07:31.517
{\an5}Wasn't I sitting with
your best friend Raina
and your mother,

07:31.584 --> 07:33.986
{\an5}trying to figure
stuff out for you?

07:31.584 --> 07:33.986
Yeah, because
I asked you to.

07:34.053 --> 07:37.790
{\an5}But Gus is also
there for me, and
so is Jeremiah

07:37.857 --> 07:40.159
the other 100% of the
time that you are not,

07:40.226 --> 07:43.796
{\an5}so therefore, I have
the right to be there
for him as I do for you.

07:43.863 --> 07:45.731
I will make
my way up there.

07:45.798 --> 07:48.067
{\an5}You have two women up
there that have your back
that are talking to you.

07:48.134 --> 07:49.235
{\an5}Kortni...

07:48.134 --> 07:49.235
Please let me finish.

07:49.302 --> 07:50.570
Kortni, but at the end
of the day,

07:50.636 --> 07:51.737
they're not my closest
friends in the house.

07:51.804 --> 07:53.506
You're my closest friend
in the house.

07:53.573 --> 07:56.776
{\an5}So, no, I don't have
Jeremiah, I don't have
Gus, I don't have Codi,

07:56.843 --> 08:00.012
{\an5}I don't have Kirk up
there to comfort me
or anything like that.

08:00.079 --> 08:01.581
Yes, they're your best
friends, but I have

08:01.647 --> 08:04.884
one closest friend in this
house, and you know that.

08:04.951 --> 08:07.954
{\an5}(Kortni)
I may be Candace's
only friend in the house,

08:08.020 --> 08:11.958
but she isn't mine.
I'm friends with everybody.

08:12.024 --> 08:16.596
Like, she can't put me in
a situation to pick and choose.

08:16.662 --> 08:18.297
Like, that's not okay.

08:18.364 --> 08:19.832
Like, I wouldn't
do that to her.

08:19.899 --> 08:21.434
She's showed her true colors
in this house so many times,

08:21.500 --> 08:23.436
I promise you I'm not
going back. I'm done.

08:23.502 --> 08:25.805
{\an5}I'm done with that (bleep).

08:23.502 --> 08:25.805
I'm so done.

08:25.872 --> 08:27.807
{\an8}I've completely lost respect
for Candace as a person.

08:27.874 --> 08:29.709
What she did tonight
is just wrong.

08:29.775 --> 08:32.445
{\an5}She's the most disrespectful
person I've ever even
came across in my life.

08:32.510 --> 08:35.047
You can't expect to get
respect for no reason.

08:35.114 --> 08:38.351
{\an5}You'd better earn it or at
least treat others with it.

08:35.114 --> 08:38.351
{\an1}Yeah.

08:38.417 --> 08:40.285
I hope GatorJay starts
(bleep) with y'all,

08:40.352 --> 08:42.855
{\an1}'cause I swear to God,
I'll knock him and her out.

08:42.922 --> 08:45.157
{\an5}Yes, it will.

08:42.922 --> 08:45.157

10:00.466 --> 10:02.234
and we're gonna drink,

Oh, I'm so excited.
Gator's coming today.

10:05.938 --> 10:08.107
{\an5}And I don't really care about
the other stuff that happened
last night.

10:13.212 --> 10:15.581
{\an8}As soon as I see Nilsa
this morning, frankly,

10:15.648 --> 10:17.984
I'm not gonna
say a word to her.

10:18.050 --> 10:21.620
She doesn't deserve
my time right now.

10:21.687 --> 10:23.990
{\an5}I do feel like there's
unfinished business
from last night,

10:24.056 --> 10:27.927
{\an5}but I'm just waiting 'til
we have to put the gloves
back on for round two.

10:27.994 --> 10:30.029
{\an4}(Gus)
I'm gonna go ahead
and tell you, Nilsa,

10:30.096 --> 10:32.031
{\an1}you lost somebody who
had your back last night.

10:32.098 --> 10:35.067
And how is that?
For keeping it real?

10:35.134 --> 10:38.504
{\an4}That's not keeping it real.
That's being malicious
and that's being evil.

10:38.571 --> 10:40.039
Ding, ding!

10:40.106 --> 10:42.842
What did I do?

10:42.908 --> 10:45.678
{\an1}You know what you did by going
upstairs and starting that.

10:45.745 --> 10:47.947
For having
my friend's back?

10:48.014 --> 10:49.849
{\an1}How exactly was that
having her back?

10:49.915 --> 10:51.917
Telling her I think
she needs to clarify

10:51.984 --> 10:54.754
what GatorJay is
supposed to be called.

10:54.820 --> 10:56.555
{\an1}Southside God?
I have to call him a god?

10:56.622 --> 10:58.090
You don't have to
call him a god.

10:58.157 --> 11:00.960
{\an1}That was my argument,
and when she comes downstairs

11:01.027 --> 11:03.162
{\an4}and busts my chops for
saying, "You have to
call him Southside God,"

11:03.229 --> 11:04.597
{\an1}and I said
that was my problem...

11:04.663 --> 11:06.065
She did not say you had to
call him Southside God.

11:06.132 --> 11:08.234
Did I not say that my problem
with his name the whole time?

11:08.300 --> 11:09.568
{\an5}That's exactly what I said.

11:08.300 --> 11:09.568
She did not say

11:09.635 --> 11:11.070
{\an5}you had to
call him Southside God.

11:09.635 --> 11:11.070
{\an1}Okay.

11:11.137 --> 11:15.007
{\an8}Okay, Gus, I'm being evil
and malicious

11:15.074 --> 11:18.411
{\an8}for telling my girlfriend
that she needed to clarify

11:18.477 --> 11:20.212
{\an8}what we need to call
her boyfriend?

11:20.279 --> 11:22.048
Gus, I don't need you
to have my back.

11:22.114 --> 11:24.450
Jeremiah, I don't need you
to have my back, either.

11:24.517 --> 11:25.918
{\an1}Don't worry.
You don't.

11:25.985 --> 11:28.154
So, go ahead and get that
thought out of your head.

11:28.220 --> 11:30.122
{\an8}I'm a little disappointed
because, honestly,

11:30.189 --> 11:33.459
{\an8}a little bit of me
thought Nilsa was changing,
but apparently not.

11:33.526 --> 11:35.127
What time do we have
to be at work, Aimee?

11:35.194 --> 11:36.996
{\an5}I don't know.

11:35.194 --> 11:36.996

to going to work

11:48.307 --> 11:49.842

15:30.362 --> 15:33.799
Honestly, I'm hella nervous
for the roommates to meet him.

15:33.866 --> 15:35.634
Half the house don't like me

15:35.701 --> 15:40.406
and I don't want any
arguments to pop off.

15:40.472 --> 15:43.309
I'm excited.
What's in that purse?

15:43.375 --> 15:46.045
Oh, just some baby oil
so I can oil myself up.

15:46.111 --> 15:47.946
Y'all know I get
ashy real quick.

15:48.013 --> 15:50.883
I get ashy too.

15:48.013 --> 15:50.883
{\an1}(laughs)

15:50.949 --> 15:52.451
(knocking)

15:52.518 --> 15:55.621
Aah!

15:55.688 --> 15:57.022
{\an1}Hold on. Okay,
hold on. Am I ashy?

15:57.089 --> 15:59.291
{\an6}(Aimee)
Nilsa!

15:57.089 --> 15:59.291
I'm excited!

15:59.358 --> 16:01.560
(Aimee)
What the (bleep)?

16:01.627 --> 16:05.264
{\an5}(Nilsa)
Come in!

16:01.627 --> 16:05.264
No! Don't come in!

16:05.331 --> 16:06.965
Oh, my God, I'm nervous,
I'm nervous, I'm like...

16:09.968 --> 16:11.804
{\an3}Aah!

16:09.968 --> 16:11.804
{\an1}Hello!

16:18.043 --> 16:20.979
♪♪

16:22.081 --> 16:23.649
(knocking)

16:25.784 --> 16:28.387
{\an9}Aah!

16:25.784 --> 16:28.387
{\an7}Hello!

16:28.454 --> 16:30.489
{\an8}Oh, I hope you stay.

16:30.556 --> 16:33.792
Hi, how are you?

16:33.859 --> 16:37.663
{\an5}Oh, my gosh,
I've missed you!

16:33.859 --> 16:37.663
{\an1}Did you?

16:37.730 --> 16:39.965
{\an7}(Candace)
Guess who's in town!
Look at the camera.

16:40.032 --> 16:41.900
{\an8}GatorJay 231
Southside God.

16:41.967 --> 16:44.136
{\an9}Hey!

16:41.967 --> 16:44.136
{\an7}Hey!

16:44.203 --> 16:45.204
{\an7}So we're gonna
have a good time.

16:45.270 --> 16:48.073
{\an1}We gonna drink.
We're gonna turn up.

16:50.476 --> 16:51.977
{\an7}Oh!

16:52.044 --> 16:54.079
(Codi)
I guess he's here.

16:54.146 --> 16:55.647
(Aimee and Nilsa)
One, two, three...

16:55.714 --> 16:58.183
(in unison)
Welcome to the Thot House!

16:58.250 --> 17:00.119
{\an1}Hey!

16:58.250 --> 17:00.119
{\an3}Yay!

17:00.185 --> 17:03.355
{\an8}I'm so excited about finally
meeting the man,

17:03.422 --> 17:07.126
the myth, the legend,
GatorJay 231 Southside God.

17:07.192 --> 17:09.060
Hey, hey,
I got you something.

17:09.127 --> 17:11.396
{\an5}What'd you get me?

17:09.127 --> 17:11.396
She made you a hot dog.

17:11.463 --> 17:15.267
{\an4}It says... It says,
"Welcome to the Thot House,
GatorJay 231 Southside God."

17:18.436 --> 17:20.204
{\an7}Oh!

17:18.436 --> 17:20.204
{\an8}A hot dog!

17:18.436 --> 17:20.204
{\an9}Oh!

17:20.271 --> 17:22.307
Let's go meet GatorJay,
I guess.

17:22.374 --> 17:24.175
{\an5}(Gus)
Oh, man, I don't even
want to go in there, dude.

17:24.242 --> 17:26.779
Honestly, at this point, I don't
have a problem with the dude,

17:26.845 --> 17:30.082
{\an8}but I don't really care to meet
him just because of all the
tension between me and Candace.

17:30.149 --> 17:31.784
{\an5}What's up, man?
Jeremiah.

17:30.149 --> 17:31.784
What's going on?

17:31.850 --> 17:33.519
These are my roommates.

17:33.585 --> 17:35.521
What's up, man? Gus.

17:33.585 --> 17:35.521
{\an1}Hey.

17:35.587 --> 17:37.523
And we got you a beer.

17:37.589 --> 17:39.091
She probably drank
all the Hennessey.

17:40.426 --> 17:41.760
{\an8}(laughter)

17:41.827 --> 17:43.929
{\an8}I'm kinda like...

17:43.996 --> 17:46.498
{\an8}Is the the GatorJay
that you described?

17:46.565 --> 17:48.167
You were talking about,
he's gangster.

17:48.233 --> 17:49.501
Don't look really
gangster to me.

17:49.568 --> 17:50.969
He must be a nice gangster,

17:51.036 --> 17:52.538
like, "Hey, let me
open my trunk up.

17:52.604 --> 17:54.106
"Let's see what kind
of shoes I got in here.

17:54.173 --> 17:56.575
Check these shoes out.
What size do you wear?"

17:58.277 --> 18:00.012
{\an8}(laughter)

18:00.078 --> 18:01.413
I think I might
could take him.

18:01.480 --> 18:02.981
(Candace)
Did you bring my pimp cup?

18:04.917 --> 18:06.652
{\an8}(laughter)

18:06.718 --> 18:08.921
Literally, I've never seen
Candace smile as much,

18:08.987 --> 18:10.689
and it makes me feel
really good.

18:10.756 --> 18:13.325
{\an5}Like, finally, we got
someone in the house
that can please Candace.

18:13.392 --> 18:14.693
Well, sit down.
You can go, go sit down.

18:14.760 --> 18:17.629
You can come sit by
Shotty Doowap 251.

18:17.696 --> 18:21.133
{\an5}(Kortni)
I hear GatorJay,
you know, walk in.

18:21.200 --> 18:25.037
{\an8}Everyone's like, "Whoo!
Welcome, Blahdahdahlala."

18:25.103 --> 18:26.405
{\an8}I don't really care.

18:26.472 --> 18:28.106
{\an5}(Codi)
So, Gator,
where are you from?

18:29.341 --> 18:30.509
{\an8}Yeah.

18:29.341 --> 18:30.509
{\an9}Okay.

18:30.576 --> 18:32.878
What's up?

18:32.945 --> 18:34.613
What's up, Gator?

18:34.680 --> 18:36.148
If you would have been here
yesterday morning,

18:36.215 --> 18:37.549
we'd probably be friends.

18:39.418 --> 18:40.686
{\an8}Sandy Springs.

18:43.222 --> 18:44.823
Right now, yep.
I have to be, bro.

18:44.890 --> 18:46.358
He sits courtside NBA.

18:48.961 --> 18:51.897
{\an8}(laughter)

18:51.964 --> 18:53.999
{\an8}Candace's type.
He's just a hood-ass dude,

18:54.066 --> 18:57.803
in and out of prison,
belly, loves Hennessy.

18:57.870 --> 18:59.037
(laughs)

18:59.104 --> 19:00.439
All right, I'm about
to go get dressed.

19:00.506 --> 19:01.974
Nilsa, is that
how you're going?

19:02.040 --> 19:04.943
Hell, nah.
I'm going to get ready.

19:05.010 --> 19:06.445
{\an5}Oh, you want to see
the house?
Sure.

19:06.512 --> 19:09.515
{\an1}Come on. Give him
a little tour.

19:11.650 --> 19:13.552
{\an6}I like him.

19:11.650 --> 19:13.552
{\an1}Yeah, man,
he's cool as hell.

19:13.619 --> 19:15.020
He is.
He's really cool.

19:15.087 --> 19:19.258
He looks exactly how I thought
a guy would look for Candace.

19:19.324 --> 19:21.460
{\an3}Hmm.

19:21.527 --> 19:24.530
♪ Ah ah ah ah ah ah ♪

19:24.596 --> 19:27.132
♪ Ah ah ah ah ah ♪

19:27.199 --> 19:30.702
♪ I don't know where
it started ♪

19:30.769 --> 19:33.705
♪♪

19:36.341 --> 19:37.776
You all right?

19:37.843 --> 19:39.111
{\an1}I mean, honestly, I feel
like y'all are playing

19:39.177 --> 19:40.445
{\an1}both sides of the fence
and you don't even

19:40.512 --> 19:41.947
have our back. That's
just what I'm feeling.

19:42.014 --> 19:43.181
I'm just gonna be
honest with you.

19:43.248 --> 19:45.417
{\an3}(laughs)

19:45.484 --> 19:47.452
{\an4}(Codi)
I'm not trying to be playing
both sides of the fence,

19:47.519 --> 19:49.688
{\an5}but this is our guest
and I want to respect him.
He's gonna be here.

19:49.755 --> 19:51.323
Oh, I got no problem
with the dude.

19:51.390 --> 19:53.959
Jeremiah and Gus are being
straight-up girls right now.

19:54.026 --> 19:56.194
Like, why don't you like me
but you like them?

19:56.261 --> 19:58.030
Like, that's so unfair.
Like, shut up, bro.

19:58.096 --> 19:59.598
You're a grown-ass man.
Like, who gives a (bleep)?

19:59.665 --> 20:03.368
Like, we already knew that Aimee
and Nilsa do not like you guys.

20:03.435 --> 20:05.604
Oh, you're mad at us for
them not being mad at us?

20:05.671 --> 20:07.306
{\an1}Obviously, they don't
(bleep) like y'all.

20:07.372 --> 20:08.674
{\an4}(Gus)
I'm mad at y'all because
y'all didn't step in
and say nothing.

20:08.740 --> 20:10.642
I wasn't even
(bleep) here, Gus.

20:10.709 --> 20:12.244
{\an1}Like, why is it
just on them?

20:12.311 --> 20:13.812
I don't know!
It's not us!

20:13.879 --> 20:15.113
Like, how the (bleep)
can he be mad at us?

20:15.180 --> 20:16.915
{\an1}They obviously don't
like them, they like us.

20:16.982 --> 20:18.684
It's like, we can't
change their mind.

20:18.750 --> 20:21.653
{\an5}Hey, Nilly, Aimee,
hate us, okay, so they
can be (bleep) happy!

20:21.720 --> 20:24.890
{\an4}No, I don't hate--
First of all,
I don't hate Kortni.

20:24.957 --> 20:26.625
I need to have a full face
of makeup on

20:26.692 --> 20:30.162
before I go ten rounds with you,
so give me, like, two minutes.

20:30.228 --> 20:33.298
{\an1}Is everybody not Team Against
Gus And Jeremiah right now?

20:33.365 --> 20:35.167
{\an1}No.

20:33.365 --> 20:35.167
{\an3}No!

20:35.233 --> 20:37.135
I said, I ain't gonna
let y'all ruin my summer.

20:37.202 --> 20:40.172
Literally, Gus is just trying to
find anything to fight about.

20:40.238 --> 20:41.873
Why would you think
I'm against you?

20:41.940 --> 20:44.109
{\an5}(Gus)
I'm just saying,
y'all are mad at us
for whatever reason.

20:44.176 --> 20:46.478
{\an5}I'm not mad at
neither one of y'all.
I don't care!

20:46.545 --> 20:48.714
{\an1}But y'all are being mad
at me and him specifically.

20:48.780 --> 20:49.982
I'm not mother(bleep) mad!

20:50.048 --> 20:51.149
{\an4}(Gus)
I'm not pointing at you
specifically.

20:51.216 --> 20:52.284
I'm talking about
the whole group.

20:52.351 --> 20:54.353
Candace, Nilsa,
everybody in this house.

20:54.419 --> 20:56.188
Candace ain't here
to defend herself.

20:56.254 --> 20:58.724
{\an5}(Kirk)
Me and Codi are obviously the
most liked guys in this house.

20:58.790 --> 21:01.493
{\an5}Like, look at us.
Like, we're the ones
that don't give a (bleep).

21:01.560 --> 21:03.195
Have you not noticed that?

21:03.261 --> 21:05.130
Hey, maybe if I
just don't give a (bleep)

21:05.197 --> 21:07.833
and don't be petty
and don't say dumb (bleep),

21:07.899 --> 21:09.167
maybe people would
actually like me.

21:09.234 --> 21:10.736
Oh, okay. I don't know.
Like, take the note.

21:10.802 --> 21:12.104
Like, you know everything
already, right?

21:12.170 --> 21:15.207
What I said to Candace was,
I think we need to clarify

21:15.273 --> 21:18.677
{\an1}what GatorJoe--
GatorJay's name is.

21:18.744 --> 21:21.680
{\an5}That's what I said.
And I said, I think
you should too.

21:21.747 --> 21:25.550
{\an4}Because Candace is always
saying no one has her back,
and I had her (bleep) back.

21:25.617 --> 21:27.886
They up there, arguing.

21:27.953 --> 21:30.022
Man, he ain't even
been here five minutes.

21:30.088 --> 21:33.425
Take the shot.
Go upstairs. Come on.

21:35.861 --> 21:37.329
{\an9}Come on.

21:39.197 --> 21:42.067
{\an8}Gator, this is the kitchen,
this is the stairs,

21:42.134 --> 21:44.736
this is the bathroom,
this is my roommates fighting.

21:44.803 --> 21:46.571
That is definitely
part of the house tour.

21:46.638 --> 21:48.707
{\an5}You know I got to
show him everything,
including the altercations.

21:48.774 --> 21:51.743
(overlapping chatter)

21:51.810 --> 21:52.944
I done
done enough fighting.

21:53.011 --> 21:54.246
I'm just gonna do
Gator's hair.

21:54.312 --> 21:56.114
I like his puffball,
so I'ma play in it,

21:56.181 --> 21:57.883
'cause it calms me down.

21:57.949 --> 22:00.152
{\an5}Gator, for the record,
we got no problem with
you, man, at all.

22:00.218 --> 22:02.487
{\an5}Oh, we ain't trippin'.

22:00.218 --> 22:02.487
We ain't trippin' at all.

22:02.554 --> 22:04.356
{\an5}Our problem...
Our problem is
with Candace.

22:04.423 --> 22:06.124
{\an5}It's not with you.
I just want to
make that clear.

22:06.191 --> 22:07.359
I got no problem
with you at all.

22:07.426 --> 22:10.095
{\an7}What you got a problem
with Candace about?

22:12.531 --> 22:14.266
{\an5}It is what it is.
You can't get along
with everybody.

22:14.332 --> 22:15.434
{\an5}(Kortni)
Nothing is
getting resolved.

22:15.500 --> 22:17.135
Literally more bull(bleep)

22:17.202 --> 22:20.105
is just piling up
on top of each other.

22:20.172 --> 22:23.175
{\an5}All right. So can we
drop it and not ever
bring it up?

22:23.241 --> 22:25.544
{\an5}I'll forgive it but I'm
not gonna forget it,
'cause I'm not gonna...

22:25.610 --> 22:27.179
{\an1}No, I'm saying, we
ain't gotta forgive it.

22:27.245 --> 22:28.714
{\an1}I'm just saying
forget it.

22:28.780 --> 22:30.082
{\an5}I'm done doing that.

22:28.780 --> 22:30.082
Me neither.

22:30.148 --> 22:31.983
{\an5}Me neither.

22:30.148 --> 22:31.983
I'm done doing that.

22:32.050 --> 22:34.252
{\an5}Okay, then just
leave it at that.
Agree to disagree.

22:34.319 --> 22:35.787
{\an5}Like, this is some
dumbass (bleep) to
argue about anyway.

22:35.854 --> 22:37.522
{\an5}I think so too, Kirk.

22:35.854 --> 22:37.522
I think so too.

22:37.589 --> 22:38.890
Welcome to
the Beach House.

22:38.957 --> 22:40.225
I know, right?

22:42.594 --> 22:45.597
{\an8}(laughter)

22:45.664 --> 22:47.799
Brah, I thought I found
your hat for a second.

22:47.866 --> 22:49.301
{\an1}Oh, no, no,
it's in their bathroom.

22:49.367 --> 22:51.570
{\an1}Nilsa and Aimee
confiscated my hats.

22:51.636 --> 22:53.805
Really? You got
drunk as a skunk.

22:53.872 --> 22:55.240
First of all,
she loses her hat.

22:55.307 --> 22:56.541
Guess where it is?
Under my bed.

22:56.608 --> 22:58.110
She loses her boots.
Guess where they are?

22:58.176 --> 22:59.811
{\an5}Under my bed.
She loses her hat.
Guess where it is?

22:59.878 --> 23:02.547
{\an5}In our bathroom,
'cause she gets drunk
and puts 'em there.

23:02.614 --> 23:04.816
{\an4}(Aimee)
She got drunk and
got in the bed with
me the other day.

23:04.883 --> 23:06.151
{\an7}(Nilsa)
Yeah.

23:04.883 --> 23:06.151

34:33.704 --> 34:36.274
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

34:36.340 --> 34:38.141
You don't just have
to be disrespectful

34:38.208 --> 34:39.976
to the person
that's talking to her,

34:40.043 --> 34:41.879
especially if
you know that person.

34:41.946 --> 34:43.781
{\an1}(exhales)
Yeah.

34:43.848 --> 34:45.349
There's a way
you go about (bleep)

34:45.416 --> 34:47.552
{\an5}and there's
a way you don't.

34:45.416 --> 34:47.552
(phone ringing)

34:47.618 --> 34:51.054
{\an7}Thot House. Queen
of the Thots speaking.

34:51.121 --> 34:52.590
{\an8}Who is this?

34:54.826 --> 34:57.094
{\an7}Logan, I thought
you were here with us.

34:57.161 --> 34:59.564
{\an8}Speaking of the devil.

35:00.832 --> 35:02.700
{\an7}Well, no, this is...
No, this ain't Kortni.

35:02.767 --> 35:05.069
{\an7}This is Nilsa,
so hold on.

35:06.871 --> 35:08.573
{\an8}Logan, don't-- don't
talk to me like that.

35:18.449 --> 35:22.119
{\an7}Okay, okay, okay, okay.
I'm giving the phone to her.

35:26.691 --> 35:29.393
{\an8}Yeah. What the (bleep)?

35:29.460 --> 35:31.128
{\an9}Hello?

35:32.530 --> 35:34.632
{\an8}What's going on?

35:37.268 --> 35:40.304
{\an8}Okay, who-- hold on,
hold on, hold on, hold on.

35:40.371 --> 35:43.074
{\an8}Let me move the phone
to where-- Hold on.

35:56.821 --> 36:00.224
{\an7}Okay, why are you
so angry right now?

36:02.059 --> 36:05.897
{\an8}Yeah, and I apologized to you
and I thought it was dropped.

36:10.034 --> 36:12.069
{\an8}You told me
you were gonna call me

36:12.136 --> 36:15.273
{\an8}and I told you to
call me whenever
your phone was charged.

36:16.641 --> 36:20.044
{\an7}Okay, well, the only time
it's rang was this one time.

36:20.111 --> 36:24.515
Dude! Logan is having
a panic attack.

36:28.019 --> 36:32.189
{\an8}And I apologized several
times and did you not
say that it was dropped?

36:32.256 --> 36:36.127
{\an8}When we were at Newbys,
did you not say that
it was dropped?

36:36.193 --> 36:40.264
{\an7}Okay, so for the last time,
I am sorry that I put
my hand in your face,

36:40.331 --> 36:42.967
{\an7}and it will not happen again
because I disrespected you

36:43.034 --> 36:45.636
{\an8}and I apologize for that.
Are we clear?

36:47.405 --> 36:49.974
{\an8}Are you high?

36:50.041 --> 36:51.776
{\an8}Are you (bleep) stoned?

36:54.779 --> 36:56.280
{\an7}He'll call you in
the morning. Trust me.

36:56.347 --> 36:58.883
{\an7}Just (bleep) let it be
for right now.

37:00.151 --> 37:02.320
{\an8}I think Kortni is finally
getting the fact

37:02.386 --> 37:03.854
that Logan's
nothing but trouble.

37:03.921 --> 37:06.157
No guy should be talking to
one of my sisters like that.

37:20.838 --> 37:23.708
{\an8}(Jeremiah)
Why is Logan jealous of me?

37:23.774 --> 37:28.045
{\an8}I mean, I don't get it...
at all.

37:28.112 --> 37:30.648
{\an8}Like, why?

37:42.460 --> 37:44.895
{\an5}(Jeremiah)
The <i> S.S. Logan</i>
just hit an iceberg

37:44.962 --> 37:48.733
and it's about to sink, man.
Kortni needs to abandon ship.

37:48.799 --> 37:51.102
{\an8}Okay, I need to
get off the phone.

37:52.403 --> 37:53.604
{\an8}(hangs up receiver)

37:53.671 --> 37:58.342
{\an8}Holy (bleep)!
He just...

37:58.409 --> 38:00.077
{\an1}It was a (bleep)
jealousy thing, dude.

38:00.144 --> 38:04.115
I need a Xanax or ten.
Holy (bleep)!

38:06.083 --> 38:08.319
{\an4}(Candace)
So, what did I do
to make you upset?

38:11.188 --> 38:13.891
{\an8}Should I just not
have invited you?

38:13.958 --> 38:16.027
{\an8}My phone calls.

38:19.330 --> 38:21.098
{\an1}Well, if you're gonna
be mad at me over that,

38:21.165 --> 38:22.600
{\an1}then I guess we
should just sleep.

38:22.667 --> 38:24.535
{\an1}I should just roll over
and go to sleep,

38:24.602 --> 38:26.103
{\an8}'cause you not gonna be...

38:32.576 --> 38:35.713
{\an7}Well, then, fine, then.
Go get a room.

38:35.780 --> 38:38.382
{\an7}Because you really
being an ass(bleep).

38:38.449 --> 38:40.618
{\an8}(Candace)
Gator is still upset
about the phone call.

38:40.685 --> 38:44.188
{\an8}At this point, like,
I've lost today

38:44.255 --> 38:45.823
{\an8}in every possible way,

38:45.890 --> 38:47.925
{\an8}so, you know, it's just
time to turn it in.

38:47.992 --> 38:49.293
{\an1}(sighs)

38:49.360 --> 38:50.628
(phone ringing)

38:50.695 --> 38:53.097
Got it!

It's a guy for Candace again.

39:06.210 --> 39:07.778
What the (bleep) do I do?

39:07.845 --> 39:11.148
One second.

This is not gonna end well.

39:31.936 --> 39:34.038
{\an1}(man)
<i>Hey, can I talk to Candace?</i>

39:37.541 --> 39:39.210
One second.

39:43.914 --> 39:46.050
(Candace)
Yes, you did...

39:51.122 --> 39:54.525
{\an8}(Nilsa whispering)

39:54.592 --> 39:57.194
{\an8}(bleep)!

39:57.261 --> 39:58.796
{\an7}No, I know, I know,
I know, I know.

40:00.331 --> 40:02.733
{\an8}(Candace)
So to make the night
even more perfect,

40:02.800 --> 40:06.003
Nilsa comes up and tells me
there's a guy for me

40:06.070 --> 40:08.272
on the phone
in front of Gator.

40:08.339 --> 40:10.808
{\an8}Really, Nilsa? Like, you
couldn't take a message?

40:10.875 --> 40:14.044
{\an8}You couldn't like, you know,
write down a name?

40:14.111 --> 40:15.880
{\an8}(Nilsa)
It's her roommate,
it's her roommate.

40:15.946 --> 40:17.448
{\an7}(Candace)
That wasn't necessary.

40:17.515 --> 40:19.583
{\an8}(Nilsa)
Me?

40:17.515 --> 40:19.583
{\an7}You didn't know.
It's not necessary.

40:19.650 --> 40:20.951
{\an8}(Nilsa)
No, I was saying,
'cause...

40:21.018 --> 40:22.987

Give me the phone.
Hello?

40:23.053 --> 40:24.221
{\an1}Candace, don't--
don't hate me.

40:24.288 --> 40:25.356
{\an1}I just--
It was for you.

40:25.422 --> 40:27.424
No. It's not that big
of a deal.

40:27.491 --> 40:28.793
It's not that big of a deal.
I understand.
