Just a little bit.

17:02.287 --> 17:04.278
Couldn't you wait, you useless git?

17:04.327 --> 17:06.282
Even you should know that.

17:06.327 --> 17:11.526
Oh, great. l rushed down here to help out,
for the good of my eldest son,

17:11.567 --> 17:16.686
my first-born,
and where the fuck were you?

17:16.727 --> 17:19.719
l couldn't find you.
l had to settle for this joker.

17:19.767 --> 17:21.280
Oh, fucking charming!

17:21.327 --> 17:23.887
Where do l sign for expenses,
loss of income and all that?

17:23.926 --> 17:24.962
What l see as a priority...

17:25.007 --> 17:26.076
You're fired! Fuck off!

17:26.127 --> 17:27.799
Have a bath!

17:30.007 --> 17:32.521
Who's good, any ideas?

17:32.567 --> 17:35.877
Billy Thomson got us off that hit and run
during a driving lesson.

17:35.927 --> 17:40.443
That's because the instructor had
a breakdown before he got to court.

17:40.487 --> 17:41.840
lronic or what?

17:41.887 --> 17:44.003
Our family use Old Man Jacks.

17:44.047 --> 17:46.561
Yeah, and how many of them are behind bars?

17:46.607 --> 17:50.122
Who's the Yorkshire one
who's never lost a case?

17:51.327 --> 17:55.115
Um, you know,
did the triple murder in the barn.

17:55.167 --> 17:57.476
Proved it was the priest
and not the husband.

17:57.527 --> 18:00.883
Erm... Oh... Erm...

18:00.927 --> 18:06.365
lt's Kavanagh, Kavanagh QC!
l've forgotten the mini rolls.

18:06.407 --> 18:08.921
What kind of legal secretary
would l make?

18:10.447 --> 18:12.085
Lip didn't burgle that house.

18:12.127 --> 18:15.278
He twatted a cop and said so on tape,
or rather you did.

18:15.327 --> 18:18.399
- lf anybody else blames me, l'm off.
- Dick!

18:18.447 --> 18:21.200
(lan) Somebody must know something.

18:21.247 --> 18:24.000
(Marty) Let's start asking round.
(Kev) Starting with who?

18:24.047 --> 18:26.038
l don't know,
but if we kick enough of them,

18:26.087 --> 18:27.998
someone's going to say something.
KlLL!

18:28.047 --> 18:30.561
What's it like in prison?

18:30.607 --> 18:34.361
Third time's not so bad.
The first scared me shitless.

18:34.407 --> 18:36.602
Everyone's after your arse.

18:36.647 --> 18:39.798
Food, fags, stamps, mainly your arse.

18:43.767 --> 18:48.602
Petrocelli, l used to fancy him rotten.
Lived in a trailer.

18:51.807 --> 18:54.844
(Prisoner) Oi! Get me out of here!

19:00.047 --> 19:03.005
Oi! ls there anybody there?

19:03.047 --> 19:04.639
Hey, you!

19:06.887 --> 19:08.878
SOBBlNG

19:11.407 --> 19:13.796
- Talk.
- What about?

19:13.847 --> 19:16.600
Don't fuck about, Carl!
l want to know what you know.

19:16.647 --> 19:17.966
Nothing.

19:18.007 --> 19:20.123
Help yourself here, Carl.

19:20.167 --> 19:23.557
You knew the keys to that house
were at Sheila's, didn't you?

19:23.607 --> 19:28.635
No. Well, yeah. l took them,
but l didn't mean to...l swear.

19:28.687 --> 19:31.918
Don't tell Lip, please...

19:31.967 --> 19:34.242
Go on, talk.

19:34.287 --> 19:38.565
Me and Trogs went round to
watch a video for a laugh.

19:38.607 --> 19:40.040
Vince turned up with his mates.

19:40.087 --> 19:42.760
All right?

19:42.807 --> 19:46.163
l told him to leave stuff alone
and they just took everything.

19:46.207 --> 19:49.756
(Vince) Get the microwave. Smash it!

19:49.807 --> 19:53.083
Get the video! Grab it, go on!

19:53.127 --> 19:56.244
Look for some money!

19:56.287 --> 19:59.518
Me and Trogs legged it
to take the keys back.

19:59.567 --> 20:01.239
We didn't know Lip
went back to get them.

20:01.287 --> 20:02.879
You won't tell the others, will you?

20:02.927 --> 20:04.883
Go and get it all back.

20:04.927 --> 20:05.882
They'll kill me.

20:05.927 --> 20:08.282
This is all your fault.
What you gonna do about it?

20:08.327 --> 20:10.522
l don't know. What do we do?

20:10.567 --> 20:13.081
We?! There's no fucking we!

20:13.127 --> 20:15.436
l'm not going round there.

20:15.487 --> 20:17.478
l am.

20:17.527 --> 20:21.122
He needs sorting. We need to talk.

20:21.167 --> 20:22.566
lt wasn't me.

20:22.607 --> 20:23.756
Yeah(!) Get in.

20:23.807 --> 20:25.923
(Man) l've been waiting for hours.

20:25.967 --> 20:31.041
l've got to get home to see me wife
and take the dog out for a piss.

20:31.087 --> 20:35.603
Do you hear me? Come on.
Never mind ignoring me.

20:35.647 --> 20:42.200
Mr Gallagher, you'll receive a letter
advising you of the court dates.

20:42.247 --> 20:44.556
Check your possessions, sign there.

20:46.847 --> 20:50.886
Fiona, these are all lawyers that
the custody officers think are twats,

20:50.927 --> 20:52.360
meaning they're fine.

20:52.407 --> 20:54.921
Did you speak to Neary?

20:54.967 --> 20:57.356
Well?

20:57.407 --> 21:02.083
Kiss my big hairy swingers,
you fucking loser!

21:02.127 --> 21:04.960
Thanks for trying, Tony.

21:05.007 --> 21:06.599
Thanks for bringing him home.

21:13.167 --> 21:14.759
Oi.

21:14.807 --> 21:16.684
Pull your finger out.

21:16.727 --> 21:18.365
What's it to you?
You're not even family.

21:18.407 --> 21:20.682
Fiona deserves better than this.

21:20.727 --> 21:22.365
lf it's down to me to sort it,
l'll sort it.

21:22.407 --> 21:26.844
You think she'd look twice at you,
you fucking psycho.

21:29.727 --> 21:31.365
Psycho.

21:31.527 --> 21:33.245
ls Debbie in?

21:33.287 --> 21:36.518
Sorry, Lucy, she's gone already.
Can l give her a message?

21:36.567 --> 21:38.444
Can you tell her l gave her
the wrong tape?

21:38.487 --> 21:42.639
- My mum went spare - it's her wedding video.
- l'll pass it on, don't you worry.

21:46.607 --> 21:49.724
Well, can't l leave you alone for one minute?

21:49.767 --> 21:53.476
lt's a few tapes for some friends.
They can't afford brand-new.

21:53.527 --> 21:58.237
l do some for old people, too.
They can't get out much and a cripple.

22:04.927 --> 22:07.441
lt's as close as he can remember
to what they took.

22:07.487 --> 22:09.762
Memorise it.
This is what you're looking for, OK?

22:09.807 --> 22:12.685
The place will be full of knock-off.
FUCK OFF!

22:12.727 --> 22:14.718
We only want what's on the list.

22:14.767 --> 22:18.157
lf she gets her stuff back, she might change
her mind and drop the charges.

22:18.207 --> 22:19.959
Marty, are you sure
you've done this before?

22:20.007 --> 22:21.725
Of course.

22:23.127 --> 22:24.560
Right. Who lives here?

22:25.607 --> 22:26.722
Chugs.

22:26.767 --> 22:29.042
- But who'll be sleeping there?
- His brother Vince.

22:31.727 --> 22:32.796
Vince's mate, Tel.

22:34.527 --> 22:37.724
And maybe Vince's bird, Shaz.

22:38.047 --> 22:39.275
God!

22:39.327 --> 22:42.046
She's fucking evil.
lf she wakes up, leg it.

22:42.087 --> 22:43.759
(Carl) What if someone does come?

22:43.807 --> 22:45.525
You keep a lookout, l'll do the rest.

22:45.567 --> 22:47.956
Any trouble, we'll torch the place.

22:48.007 --> 22:50.441
No-one's going to torch anything.
You promised.

22:50.487 --> 22:51.966
Give me your matches, Marty.

22:55.207 --> 22:57.437
l don't want to go. Please!

22:57.487 --> 23:00.047
He's gonna be no use to anybody.

23:00.087 --> 23:01.759
He comes or who learns lessons from this?

23:01.807 --> 23:04.446
How's he going to live with himself,
if he just bottles out?

23:04.487 --> 23:05.966
You've got eyes, haven't you?

23:07.527 --> 23:09.916
lt's his fault anyway.

23:16.727 --> 23:19.082
(Marty) (Wake up, Carl, time to go.)

23:20.487 --> 23:23.559
Carl! Hang on to him!

23:23.607 --> 23:26.644
l know what'll wake him.

23:26.687 --> 23:27.802
Wide awake club!

23:27.847 --> 23:29.644
- What are you giving him?
- Speed.

23:29.687 --> 23:32.360
- Marty!
- Wakey, wakey!

23:32.407 --> 23:34.875
Well, he's slow at the best of times.

23:34.927 --> 23:36.963
They're safe enough. Come on.

23:40.007 --> 23:42.237
THUNDER CRASHES

23:42.287 --> 23:44.482
Wake up!

23:51.727 --> 23:53.638
Where the fuck is he?

23:53.687 --> 23:57.123
Getaway car's sorted.

23:58.007 --> 24:00.646
Now we're talking. Good thinking, Marty.

24:02.447 --> 24:03.402
Right.

24:03.447 --> 24:06.200
One elephant, two elephant,
three elephant.

24:14.887 --> 24:17.560
(Marty) Fucker spunk! Ninja assassin!

24:20.927 --> 24:22.724
(Hurry up.)

24:23.727 --> 24:24.716
Quiet!

24:25.687 --> 24:28.042
(Here! Take it.)

24:28.087 --> 24:29.566
Get us some more stuff.

24:32.927 --> 24:35.521
(Marty) Arsehole!

24:35.567 --> 24:37.922
l've got some fishing rods, put them in.

24:37.967 --> 24:40.925
None of this stuff's on the list.

24:40.967 --> 24:42.719
Where's the woman's stuff?

24:46.127 --> 24:47.924
(Marty) Ski boots. On the piste!

24:47.967 --> 24:49.559
Argh!

24:49.607 --> 24:51.802
(Woman) Who's there?

24:51.847 --> 24:52.836
Go, go!

24:52.887 --> 24:54.957
(Woman) ls there anybody there?

24:55.007 --> 24:56.998
Faster!

25:04.007 --> 25:05.759
Whoo-hoo!

25:07.607 --> 25:09.802
Marty, watch the bastard cars!

25:13.087 --> 25:16.523
You've got all the wrong stuff.
You're absolutely fucking useless!

25:16.567 --> 25:19.286
You didn't get a thing on the list.
You just panicked.

25:19.327 --> 25:22.956
What was that great big robbery
you said you'd been on?

25:23.007 --> 25:25.919
Fucking Oxfam shop?

25:25.967 --> 25:29.243
Fiona's gonna go spare.

25:29.287 --> 25:30.766
Fiona!

25:36.847 --> 25:38.883
Hiya, Carl, you're up early.

25:38.927 --> 25:40.599
Didn't go to bed. Got to level seven.

25:40.647 --> 25:44.003
Zombies. Killed loads. AK-47.
Ran out of health in the graveyard.

25:44.047 --> 25:47.164
Still got second highest score, though.
See you.

25:47.207 --> 25:50.040
Hey, you don't have to go to school,
you know.

25:50.087 --> 25:52.123
Stay home if you need
some time to yourself.

25:52.167 --> 25:54.158
l'll have plenty of time to myself soon.

25:54.207 --> 25:56.960
lf you talk like that, you're going to wreck
what time you have.

25:57.007 --> 26:00.158
Yeah, sure. Five days.

26:00.207 --> 26:03.643
This just came.
The first hearing's next Monday.

26:05.527 --> 26:08.280
They'll keep me in, Fiona.
You know they will.

26:08.327 --> 26:10.204
lt's not been our month, has it?

26:12.127 --> 26:14.402
We're gonna get you out of this mess.

26:14.447 --> 26:16.642
Hey, when have l ever let you down?

26:21.527 --> 26:25.520
Liam, what are you doing
with that fishing rod?

26:27.287 --> 26:29.039
Mum, l've got fish.

26:29.087 --> 26:30.202
Fish!

26:34.447 --> 26:37.803
Have you got a fishing licence
for this bedroom?

26:40.087 --> 26:41.998
What's up?

26:42.047 --> 26:47.485
You'd all be better off,
if l was back in prison instead of Lip.

26:47.527 --> 26:49.722
Don't say that, Marty.

26:49.767 --> 26:52.998
We're all doing our best to keep him out.

26:53.047 --> 26:56.278
What's with all the junk?

26:56.327 --> 26:58.397
l did it for you...

26:58.447 --> 27:00.244
and Lip.

27:00.287 --> 27:01.515
For me? Did what?

27:01.567 --> 27:05.799
This. l tried to nick the nurse's stuff back,
but it all went a bit tits up.

27:05.847 --> 27:06.836
We? Who's we?

27:06.887 --> 27:08.843
Me, lan and Carl. We did our best...

27:08.887 --> 27:12.084
You did what?
You took lan and Carl on a burglary?

27:12.127 --> 27:15.563
And then you've got the nerve to
say you did it for me. Are you mad?

27:15.607 --> 27:16.676
Just listen, will ya?

27:16.727 --> 27:19.719
You're right, you'd be better off
in prison. Where you belong!

27:19.767 --> 27:22.406
- Just give us a chance!
- This better be good.

27:22.447 --> 27:24.165
We thought if we could
get the stuff back,

27:24.207 --> 27:25.765
- she might drop the charges.
- And?

27:25.807 --> 27:28.719
lt wasn't there. They must
have stashed it somewhere else.

27:28.767 --> 27:30.280
So we just took what we could find.

27:30.327 --> 27:32.283
Anyway, it was lan's idea.

27:32.327 --> 27:35.478
Don't look at me.
He took the key from Sheila's.

27:35.527 --> 27:37.040
The whole thing's his fault.

27:37.087 --> 27:39.521
You did this, Carl. You bastard.

27:39.567 --> 27:42.001
No, Lip! l never meant for that. l didn't!

27:42.047 --> 27:42.957
Leave it!

27:43.007 --> 27:46.443
Shut the fuck up, all of you!

27:46.487 --> 27:50.162
How can you all do this?
l turn my back for ten minutes,

27:50.207 --> 27:53.438
the whole house goes fucking ape.

27:53.487 --> 27:55.603
Don't you think we're in enough trouble?

27:55.647 --> 27:58.320
We can't afford to mess up like this.

27:58.367 --> 28:00.562
Do you understand?

28:00.607 --> 28:02.199
Do you fuck!

28:03.807 --> 28:06.799
Who do you think you're kidding?

28:06.847 --> 28:09.236
This isn't about us.

28:09.287 --> 28:10.959
lt's about you and Steve.

28:11.007 --> 28:14.283
lt's about you feeling sorry for yourself.

28:14.327 --> 28:16.557
You feel guilty because you weren't around.

28:16.607 --> 28:18.598
At least Marty was doing something to help.

28:43.047 --> 28:44.082
Shift it, Trogs.

28:46.167 --> 28:48.681
You'll never guess what's happened
round at our house.

28:48.727 --> 28:51.560
We've been burgled.
Someone's nicked my grandma.

28:56.527 --> 28:59.246
Who in their right minds steals an urn?

28:59.287 --> 29:01.118
How was l supposed to know what it was?

29:01.167 --> 29:03.840
lt had ribbons on it.
lt looked like a football trophy to me.

29:03.887 --> 29:05.525
Big Stockport County fan.

29:05.567 --> 29:08.127
Trogs said she wanted her ashes
scattered on the pitch,

29:08.167 --> 29:11.239
but health and safety wouldn't let her.

29:11.287 --> 29:12.766
So they keep her on the telly instead?

29:12.807 --> 29:15.037
Marty!

29:15.087 --> 29:19.319
How are we meant to trade her in
if half of her is lying on your bed

29:19.367 --> 29:21.927
with your porn?

29:24.247 --> 29:25.282
Hold it.

29:25.327 --> 29:26.806
Oh, for God's sake.

29:26.847 --> 29:28.838
Lick my... Oh.

29:49.287 --> 29:51.721
PHONE RlNGS

29:53.687 --> 29:58.397
What kind? l'm not very good at accents.

29:58.447 --> 30:00.642
Anything. Just so they don't recognise you.

30:00.687 --> 30:03.121
l used to do a passable Shirley Bassey.

30:03.167 --> 30:06.239
lt's blackmail, Carol,
not Stars ln Their eyes.

30:06.287 --> 30:07.322
Do an accent.

30:15.767 --> 30:16.961
Mm?

30:17.007 --> 30:18.725
Zese are zey.

30:19.887 --> 30:21.559
No, you listen.

30:21.607 --> 30:26.522
lf you want to see Grandma alive again,
you know what l mean?

30:26.567 --> 30:30.401
Be at ze Jockey at six,
and bring all ze things on ze list.

30:30.447 --> 30:31.846
Ask for...

30:36.167 --> 30:37.156
..Sven.

30:40.167 --> 30:42.362
Sven's a bloke name.

30:52.607 --> 30:55.280
Oi. Anyone here called Sven?

30:58.727 --> 31:01.241
That'll be me.

31:01.287 --> 31:03.801
DVD player,

31:03.847 --> 31:08.125
yeah, yeah, and a cuddly toy.

31:08.167 --> 31:10.123
All accounted for.

31:10.167 --> 31:14.001
- Now, where's me grandma?
- ln the ladies, second cubicle.

31:30.127 --> 31:32.595
Gran?

31:37.927 --> 31:39.326
Look, please...

31:39.367 --> 31:41.358
Here's your stuff.

31:41.407 --> 31:43.716
Now, do you believe me?

31:47.647 --> 31:49.683
lf you've got my gear, why should l not?

31:49.727 --> 31:51.445
(Fiona) Lena, just hear us out.

31:51.487 --> 31:54.206
Lip got the keys to your house
from Sheila Jackson.

31:54.247 --> 31:57.603
Fucking mad bitch. l should have
known better than to trust her.

31:57.647 --> 32:00.798
Yes. We are related.
Lip only came round to feed the fish.

32:00.847 --> 32:04.203
Who fixed the tap in the kitchen,
if it wasn't me?

32:04.247 --> 32:07.364
Who put money in the telephone box
every time l made a call?

32:11.687 --> 32:13.325
Not all this stuff is mine.

32:13.367 --> 32:17.963
No, there's some extra bits and pieces
to compensate for your inconvenience.

32:22.327 --> 32:25.285
OK. Bring them in.

32:25.327 --> 32:26.476
Cheers.

32:29.687 --> 32:32.360
- l'm really sorry if l scared you.
- lf?

32:32.407 --> 32:35.046
What about you? l crapped myself
when you pulled that knife.

32:35.087 --> 32:37.157
l only came round to do
some homework, next thing,

32:37.207 --> 32:38.879
some copper's beating the shit
out of me.

32:38.927 --> 32:41.521
You broke into somebody's house
to do your homework.

32:41.567 --> 32:43.398
Other people's homework.

32:43.447 --> 32:46.041
lt's what l do to earn a bit of extra money.

32:46.087 --> 32:48.317
l'm saving up to go abroad.

32:48.367 --> 32:50.881
No wonder the police didn't believe you.

32:50.927 --> 32:53.725
lf l arranged all this lot for you,

32:53.767 --> 32:55.519
will you drop the charges?

33:01.487 --> 33:03.523
OK.

33:07.727 --> 33:11.766
What are you gonna do about Neary,
and the assault charge?

33:11.807 --> 33:13.763
Want to know what l'd do now?

33:19.087 --> 33:23.603
Fucking great. ''Thanks, Frank, tell us
your brilliant idea.'' Well, stuff you!

33:23.647 --> 33:25.285
Go on then, what would you do?

33:27.287 --> 33:30.836
Well, if he's that bent,
l'd just bribe the bastard.

33:30.887 --> 33:33.560
Brown envelope, full of cash,
pay him off, simple.

33:33.607 --> 33:36.041
Brilliant(!) Why didn't we think
of that? Oh yeah, we did.

33:36.087 --> 33:38.885
Then we realised we hadn't got
enough to buy a packet of fags.

33:38.927 --> 33:40.918
(Debbie) l've got 450 quid.

33:41.807 --> 33:43.320
(Lip) What?

33:44.287 --> 33:45.686
How much?

33:45.727 --> 33:51.006
450. From the videos. You can use that,
if you promise to pay me back.

33:51.047 --> 33:53.481
You had nothing to lend me yesterday.

33:53.527 --> 33:58.885
Brilliant, Debs. 450.
ls that enough to buy him off, Tony?

33:58.927 --> 34:00.963
Maybe, yeah, but it's risky, isn't it?

34:01.007 --> 34:03.726
Shut up about risky.
What help have you been?

34:03.767 --> 34:04.961
Do you think he'll go for it?

34:06.887 --> 34:08.081
Stan?

34:08.127 --> 34:09.196
Yeah.

34:09.246 --> 34:11.397
- Pigs, dirty pigs.
- (Stan) He might.

34:14.206 --> 34:15.844
Oh, thank you, me.

34:15.887 --> 34:19.277
Once again, Frank Gallagher,
crisis intervention specialist.

34:32.167 --> 34:35.239
Have you got something for me?

34:35.286 --> 34:37.243
What the fuck are you doing?

34:37.286 --> 34:39.322
You've got the wrong end of the stick here.

34:39.367 --> 34:42.404
- Shut up. Keep still.
- Ooh!

34:42.447 --> 34:44.085
You're clean.

34:44.127 --> 34:46.243
lt's not mission fucking impossible.

34:46.286 --> 34:49.518
''This pint will self-destruct in five seconds.''

34:54.487 --> 34:56.603
THEY MOUTH

34:58.327 --> 35:01.956
l'm here to give you a bung.
How much to get him off?

35:02.007 --> 35:04.441
l don't know what you're talking about.

35:04.487 --> 35:07.524
l understood you were
interested in renting my caravan

35:07.567 --> 35:09.683
in Southport for a couple of weeks.

35:09.727 --> 35:12.287
You what? Caravan?
l fucking hate caravans.

35:12.327 --> 35:14.557
This is a right cock-up.

35:14.607 --> 35:16.086
Who are you meant to be meeting?

35:16.127 --> 35:17.958
You.

35:18.007 --> 35:20.999
You should have got some
holiday money for me.

35:24.367 --> 35:26.835
Oh... Right.

35:26.887 --> 35:29.560
The caravan.

35:31.167 --> 35:32.520
All right... So how...

35:32.567 --> 35:35.718
How much for a fortnight in the caravan?

35:35.767 --> 35:37.962
A grand.

35:38.287 --> 35:39.606
Fuck me.

35:39.647 --> 35:42.241
l fucking need a pint.

35:42.287 --> 35:43.925
He wants a grand.

35:43.967 --> 35:47.846
Tell him no way. Start at 250,
and then go up in 20s if you have to.

35:47.887 --> 35:50.117
450 is the absolute limit.

35:50.167 --> 35:52.158
Leave it to me.
l can read him like a book.

35:57.207 --> 35:59.198
21 0, our final offer.

36:04.167 --> 36:05.839
Up yours, sunshine.

36:13.327 --> 36:14.521
Wait.

36:18.807 --> 36:20.877
l've heard your final offer.

36:20.927 --> 36:24.124
Caravans are more sophisticated these days

36:24.167 --> 36:28.126
than Clampetts like you lot could appreciate.

36:31.847 --> 36:34.077
This is all we've got. Take it.

36:34.127 --> 36:37.199
Just don't let him go to prison.

36:37.247 --> 36:38.885
lt's way short.

36:40.647 --> 36:43.719
But there is a way that you can
make up the difference.

36:43.767 --> 36:44.756
Oh, yeah?

36:44.807 --> 36:48.038
We could come to some arrangement.

36:48.087 --> 36:49.918
Back of the van now for a quickie,

36:49.967 --> 36:52.401
and you can save me a couple on account.

36:52.447 --> 36:55.644
A birdie tells me that you like
fucking coppers and car thieves.

36:55.687 --> 36:56.563
Piss off!

36:58.847 --> 37:00.280
No deal.

37:01.327 --> 37:05.957
And this just about covers you
wasting my time.

37:12.207 --> 37:14.596
Are you OK?

37:14.647 --> 37:16.239
l did warn you, didn't l?

37:16.287 --> 37:18.437
He's a twat.

37:18.487 --> 37:22.366
Listen, how far are you prepared to go
to sort him out, eh?

37:22.407 --> 37:26.036
All the way. Anything.

37:26.087 --> 37:30.365
lf you really mean that,
l reckon we could nail him.

37:30.407 --> 37:31.362
Here.

37:31.407 --> 37:33.398
You don't have to do this now, you know.

37:33.447 --> 37:35.642
lt saves all the scrapping later.

37:35.687 --> 37:37.279
Just don't go.

37:37.327 --> 37:40.205
We'll hide you in the roof.
lt worked for Anne Frank.

37:40.247 --> 37:42.158
They caught Anne Frank.

37:42.207 --> 37:43.799
Yeah, but not for ages.

37:43.847 --> 37:48.637
Big prize for the first one to guess
what l'm going to do with this?

37:48.687 --> 37:50.166
Lip?

37:55.047 --> 37:58.403
Philip Gallagher, sarge.
Decided to make a full statement.

37:58.447 --> 38:00.836
A confession?

38:00.887 --> 38:02.115
Let's get you in the interview room.

38:02.167 --> 38:07.082
Sergeant Neary, PC Howe -
interview room two immediately.

38:10.687 --> 38:13.326
Whoa! What the fuck
do you think you're doing?

38:13.367 --> 38:14.641
He wanted to talk to us.

38:14.687 --> 38:17.042
lt's amazing what a bit of
community liaison can do.

38:17.087 --> 38:19.920
He's mine! Come on.

38:21.327 --> 38:22.726
(Woman) Get your hands off my tits!

38:41.527 --> 38:43.040
You gonna tell me something new or not?

38:43.087 --> 38:44.236
(We'll see.)

38:44.287 --> 38:49.042
Sorry to bother you, but l
think we might have a problem.

38:52.887 --> 38:57.324
Why don't you kiss my
big hairy swingers. Here.

38:58.927 --> 39:00.997
Argh!

39:01.327 --> 39:03.716
Jesus! Stop him!

39:03.767 --> 39:05.803
Argh!

39:05.847 --> 39:07.246
Argh! Argh!

39:11.407 --> 39:14.001
Come on, this wasn't me.

39:14.047 --> 39:16.322
lt's all a fucking stitch-up, sarge!

39:16.367 --> 39:21.600
Shut up, Neary. Mr Gallagher,
do you wish to file a formal complaint?

39:21.647 --> 39:23.319
That depends.

39:23.367 --> 39:25.119
On?

39:25.167 --> 39:26.919
Whether he's saying l twatted him or not.

39:26.967 --> 39:29.845
You're being blackmailed here, sarge.

39:29.887 --> 39:34.881
No, you are,
and pretty successfully l'd say.

39:34.927 --> 39:39.079
lt's make your mind up time.
Are you pressing charges or not?

39:40.767 --> 39:42.325
Fine.

39:43.327 --> 39:44.396
Fine.

39:49.967 --> 39:52.959
And you two better watch
your fucking backs as well.

39:55.567 --> 39:58.718
Come on, you tight baskets.
Get your hands in your pockets.

39:58.767 --> 40:01.486
1 5 quid, going for the last time now,

40:01.527 --> 40:04.564
for a beautiful pair of
ladies' ski boots.

40:04.607 --> 40:06.086
Top of the range.

40:06.127 --> 40:08.402
Going to the lovely lady in the corner.

40:08.447 --> 40:12.645
Going once, going twice,
they've gone. She's a winner.

40:18.007 --> 40:21.682
By the way, let's not forget why you're here,
what it's all in aid of.

40:21.727 --> 40:26.164
Chatsworth Estate's answer to Ronald Biggs.

40:26.207 --> 40:30.086
The one, the only, at the bar
over there, Mr Lip Gallagher!

40:32.207 --> 40:34.243
This auction's being held

40:34.287 --> 40:37.404
to raise money to send Lip to America,

40:37.447 --> 40:38.926
so dig deep.

40:38.967 --> 40:40.286
Argh!

40:40.327 --> 40:41.885
ls this for me?

40:41.927 --> 40:45.044
No. l'm off out, l'll catch you later.

40:45.087 --> 40:49.126
There's one more item to auction
then we're gonna kick off the karaoke.

40:49.167 --> 40:52.204
Can we have a couple of
volunteers to get us started?

40:52.247 --> 40:54.203
Gonna have a crack,
give us your George Formby?

40:54.247 --> 40:56.203
l can only do Gene Pitney.

40:56.247 --> 40:58.158
No-one knows who he is any more.

40:58.207 --> 41:00.163
You go.

41:00.207 --> 41:03.517
Now my glamorous assistant,
isn't she gorgeous?

41:03.567 --> 41:05.125
WOLF WHlSTLES

41:05.167 --> 41:11.766
She's got hold of Lot 41 -
another brand-new fishing rod and reel.

41:11.807 --> 41:14.844
Who's gonna start the bidding
at 20 quid?

41:14.887 --> 41:17.003
20 over here, 20!

41:17.047 --> 41:20.323
For fuck's sake, Sheila,
you've already got one!

41:20.367 --> 41:24.360
One each for later,
when they're older, stop the arguments.

41:24.407 --> 41:26.477
She's not daft.

41:26.527 --> 41:28.438
Who's going to give us 25?

41:28.487 --> 41:31.479
25, over here!

41:31.527 --> 41:33.245
Sweet Jesus, give me strength!

41:36.087 --> 41:38.317
Lip, what are you doing here?

41:38.367 --> 41:39.720
Nothing illegal.

41:39.767 --> 41:43.396
lt's my night off, l said you could come
and work here tomorrow.

41:43.447 --> 41:46.996
l haven't come to do homework.
l bought you a present to say thanks.

41:47.047 --> 41:49.038
You didn't have to.

41:53.847 --> 41:56.315
l take it you didn't nick it?

41:56.367 --> 42:01.316
The receipt's in the box,
in case you weren't keen on it.

42:01.367 --> 42:03.642
Thought you could do
with the extra security.

42:04.047 --> 42:06.402
l know how to look after myself -
normally.

42:06.447 --> 42:09.723
Maybe so, but you need eyes in
the back of your head around here.

42:09.767 --> 42:12.998
My boyfriend used to
work opposite shifts to me,

42:13.047 --> 42:15.641
so the house was always occupied.

42:15.687 --> 42:18.440
You only see each other at tea times?
How does that work?

42:18.487 --> 42:20.682
lt doesn't.

42:26.167 --> 42:27.646
Listen...

42:29.727 --> 42:32.036
..Say if l'm out of order,

42:32.087 --> 42:34.965
but l'm pretty good in the sack.

42:36.807 --> 42:39.196
And why would l want to know that?

42:39.247 --> 42:40.885
Better out than in.

42:45.647 --> 42:46.796
How old are you?

42:46.847 --> 42:47.996
36.

42:56.767 --> 42:58.166
l'm off to run a bath.

42:58.207 --> 42:59.720
Like l said,

42:59.767 --> 43:03.760
give us a shout if you need
a hand with your back scrubbing.

43:03.807 --> 43:06.275
The bath's for you.

43:14.087 --> 43:15.759
Can l have a bit of hush everyone?

43:15.807 --> 43:18.367
Don't worry, Anne,
it'll be your turn soon.

43:18.407 --> 43:21.160
Ladies and gents, welcome on stage
with the voice of an angel

43:21.207 --> 43:25.678
and body of a baby hippo,
it's PC Stan Waterman!

43:34.967 --> 43:37.037
We're caught in a trap...

43:37.087 --> 43:39.078
Thank you!

43:39.127 --> 43:41.595
..l can't walk out

43:41.647 --> 43:43.319
CLAPPlNG

43:43.367 --> 43:48.441
Because l love you too much, baby

43:51.607 --> 43:53.677
Why can't you see

43:53.727 --> 43:55.080
That's him! lt's fucking Elvis!

43:55.127 --> 43:57.322
What you're doing to me

43:59.367 --> 44:03.997
When you don't believe a word l say...

44:05.287 --> 44:07.039
Come on, everybody!

44:08.327 --> 44:11.763
We can't go on together

44:11.807 --> 44:14.275
With suspicious minds

44:15.927 --> 44:19.397
And we can't build our dreams...

44:19.447 --> 44:22.644
(Screaming ladies) GET YOUR KNOB OUT!
GET YOUR KNOB OUT!
