WEBVTT

00:03.090 --> 00:05.353
PATIENT "A" IS
A 10-YEAR-OLD MALE

00:05.396 --> 00:07.268
WITH STAGE-IV LEUKEMIA.

00:07.311 --> 00:10.967
ON JANUARY 31, HE WAS BITTEN
BY A BAT DURING THE ATTACKS

00:11.011 --> 00:12.621
IN GOTHAM SQUARE,

00:12.664 --> 00:15.232
AND HE IMMEDIATELY BEGAN
SHOWING SIGNS OF SEPSIS.

00:15.276 --> 00:17.060
LATER THAT NIGHT,
HE RECEIVED A DOSE

00:17.104 --> 00:19.845
OF THE MIRACLE SERUM BP296,

00:19.889 --> 00:21.586
WHICH RELIEVED
THE SEPSIS IMMEDIATELY.

00:21.630 --> 00:23.632
HE'S HERE TODAY, HOWEVER,
BECAUSE WE DISCOVERED

00:23.675 --> 00:25.895
72 HOURS LATER
THAT IT ALSO CURED

00:25.938 --> 00:29.551
HIS STAGE-IV LEUKEMIA
COMPLETELY.

00:29.594 --> 00:31.596
SO TODAY, WE'VE ISOLATED
HIS WHITE BLOOD CELLS

00:31.640 --> 00:34.425
IN AN ATTEMPT TO SIPHON
AND REPLICATE

00:34.469 --> 00:36.732
THEIR CURATIVE PROPERTIES.

00:36.775 --> 00:40.779
WE'RE NOW MIXING THEM
IN OUR SYNTHETIC GRANULOCYTES,

00:40.823 --> 00:43.695
AND WE ARE NOW INJECTING
THEM INTO PATIENT B,

00:43.739 --> 00:46.916
AN 80-YEAR-OLD MALE
WITH A SIMILAR CANCER.

00:46.959 --> 00:49.875
OUR HYPOTHESIS IS THAT
THE NEW SOLUTION

00:49.919 --> 00:52.530
WILL ATTACK HIS CANCER
IN THE SAME WAY.

00:56.099 --> 00:59.146
WE'LL CHECK BACK IN 24 HOURS
AND LOOK FOR PROGRESS.

01:04.499 --> 01:06.240
OH. WE NEED HELP
IN HERE!

01:06.283 --> 01:07.937
JUST--JUST TRY TO SIT BACK.
JUST TRY TO RELAX.

01:07.980 --> 01:10.026
HELP! HELP!

01:12.985 --> 01:15.684
OH, OH--

01:15.727 --> 01:17.468
THE TOXIN SPREAD
BY THE BATS

01:17.512 --> 01:20.515
WAS INTENTIONALLY
DESIGNED BY HAMILTON
WITHOUT A CURE.

01:20.558 --> 01:23.605
THAT SERUM CURED IT,
AND NOT JUST THAT,

01:23.648 --> 01:25.824
IT REVERSED
HEREDITARY CONDITIONS,

01:25.868 --> 01:29.306
ERADICATED ANEMIA,
MALARIA, ALL TYPES
OF BLOOD DISEASES.

01:29.350 --> 01:31.091
WE CAN'T
REPLICATE IT, SIR.

01:31.134 --> 01:32.440
TRY AGAIN.

01:32.483 --> 01:34.572
SIR, WITH
ALL DUE RESPECT,

01:34.616 --> 01:36.574
HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE TO DIE
FOR ME TO MAKE MY POINT?

01:36.618 --> 01:38.402
AND HOW MANY PEOPLE
GET TO LIVE

01:38.446 --> 01:40.274
IF I MAKE MINE?

01:40.317 --> 01:41.927
WHATEVER WAS
IN THE ANTIDOTE
FOR THAT BAT TOXIN

01:41.971 --> 01:43.755
IS GONNA CHANGE
MODERN MEDICINE FOREVER.

01:43.799 --> 01:46.236
THE SUPPLY WAS EXHAUSTED
BEFORE WE KNEW ITS POTENTIAL,

01:46.280 --> 01:48.456
AND IT CAN'T BE
SYNTHESIZED.

01:48.499 --> 01:51.067
IT'S GONE, SIR.

01:51.111 --> 01:53.156
WELL, IT CAME
FROM SOMEWHERE, RIGHT?

01:53.200 --> 01:55.027
YOU REALLY THINK SOMEONE'S
JUST GONNA HAND OVER

01:55.071 --> 01:57.160
THE SECRET
TO A MIRACLE CURE?

01:57.204 --> 01:59.945
NO. I EXPECT THEY'RE
GONNA CHERISH IT

01:59.989 --> 02:02.122
LIKE IT'S THE MOST
VALUABLE THING
IN THE WORLD.

02:11.522 --> 02:12.741
DON'T LET
THIS DOOR CLOSE.

02:12.784 --> 02:14.264
WHAT'S THIS ONE'S DEAL?

02:19.182 --> 02:21.924
-MR. HELZINGER.
-WHAT? WHAT'S HAPPENING?

02:21.967 --> 02:26.276
AARON, IT'S ME.
IT'S DR. ROGERS.

02:26.320 --> 02:28.452
UH, TELL ME YOU
GOT A--TELL ME

02:28.496 --> 02:31.629
YOU GOT A FIX,
DOC.

02:31.673 --> 02:35.677
NOT AT THE MOMENT,
I'M AFRAID.

02:35.720 --> 02:37.592
AAH!

02:42.031 --> 02:44.816
I DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING.
HELP ME!

02:44.860 --> 02:46.470
AGH!

02:49.256 --> 02:50.779
AARON, YOU'RE OK.

02:50.822 --> 02:53.782
YOU JUST--YOU JUST
HAD AN EPISODE, OK?

02:53.825 --> 02:55.784
I CAN'T KEEP LIVING
LIKE THIS.

02:55.827 --> 02:57.046
WELL, THAT'S
WHY I'M HERE.

02:57.089 --> 02:58.439
THERE IS A CURE
FOR YOU

02:58.482 --> 02:59.962
AND FOR DOZENS
OF THEIR PATIENTS

03:00.005 --> 03:01.529
THAT ARE COOPED UP
IN HERE,

03:01.572 --> 03:05.272
AND, AARON, YOU'RE
GONNA HELP ME GET IT.

03:15.369 --> 03:18.981
THE ROLE OF BATWOMAN
WILL NOW BE PLAYED BY--

03:19.024 --> 03:21.244
WELL, WE DON'T ACTUALLY
KNOW HER NAME,

03:21.288 --> 03:24.813
BUT 2.0 SEEMS TO BE STICKING
AROUND FOR A WHILE.

03:24.856 --> 03:27.642
YOU GOT SOME BIG BOOTS
TO FILL, NEW GIRL.

ANG, PLEASE.
HE'S BUSY.

04:37.799 --> 04:39.540
IT IS THE REASON
BLACK WOMEN DIE OF NEGLECT

04:39.583 --> 04:41.063
AT A DISPROPORTIONATELY
HIGH RATE IN THIS COUNTRY.

04:41.106 --> 04:42.673
WE'RE NOT HAVING
THAT TONIGHT.

04:42.717 --> 04:44.153
YOU NEED TO GET MY GIRL
SOME ACTUAL CARE

04:44.196 --> 04:46.547
BEFORE YOU NEED
YOUR OWN.

04:46.590 --> 04:48.070
I'LL FIND
YOUR ATTENDING.

04:52.553 --> 04:57.253
OK. UM...
THAT WAS EXTRA.

04:57.297 --> 05:00.822
ALSO, THANK YOU
FOR BRINGING ME HERE.

05:00.865 --> 05:03.085
I DON'T KNOW WHO ELSE
YOU'D CALL AT 2 A.M.,

05:03.128 --> 05:05.435
-AND IF YOU DID...
-UH-UH.

05:05.479 --> 05:08.525
I WOULD HAVE BEEN
A LITTLE JEAL.

05:08.569 --> 05:12.007
ONLY YOU, BABE.

05:12.050 --> 05:13.878
MS. WILDER,
I'M DR. RODRIGUEZ.

05:13.922 --> 05:15.880
I UNDERSTAND YOU
HAVE AN INFECTION.

05:15.924 --> 05:19.493
YEAH. UM, I'VE HAD IT
A COUPLE OF MONTHS.

05:22.278 --> 05:25.368
OH. THIS IS
REALLY EXTENSIVE.

05:25.412 --> 05:28.763
-HOW'D YOU GET THIS?
-A SPIDER...

05:28.806 --> 05:30.678
IN MY WORK'S STOCKROOM.

05:30.721 --> 05:32.375
WE'LL GET YOU SOME
ANTIBIOTICS.

05:32.419 --> 05:34.377
SHOULD START TO CLEAR
UP IN ABOUT 48 HOURS.

05:34.421 --> 05:36.379
THAT'S IT?
WHEN SHE SHOWED UP

05:36.423 --> 05:38.381
AT MY DOORSTEP,
SHE COULD BARELY STAND.

05:38.425 --> 05:40.470
RUN SOME TESTS
OR SOMETHING.

05:40.514 --> 05:42.211
UNFORTUNATELY,
HER INSURANCE DOESN'T
COVER ANY BLOODWORK.

05:42.254 --> 05:44.082
I'LL COVER IT, THEN.

05:44.126 --> 05:45.997
SOMEONE WILL BE BY
TO DRAW BLOOD.

05:52.047 --> 05:54.005
YOU'RE BLOWING UP.

05:55.877 --> 05:58.445
NOW YOU HAVE
A SHORTAGE OF WORDS.

05:58.488 --> 05:59.968
YOU KNOW WHAT I DO,
RYAN.

06:00.011 --> 06:01.404
I DON'T NEED YOU
JUDGING ME FOR IT.

06:01.448 --> 06:05.582
I'M NOT JUDGING YOU.

06:05.626 --> 06:09.064
I WANT YOU TO GET OUT
WHILE YOU CAN.

06:09.107 --> 06:11.371
-GET OUT?
-YEAH.

06:11.414 --> 06:14.504
RYAN, I TRAP
FOR THE RICH AND FAMOUS.

06:14.548 --> 06:19.335
THE THINGS I KNOW ABOUT THEM,
ABOUT MY PLUG,

06:19.379 --> 06:21.076
I CAN'T JUST "GET OUT."

06:21.119 --> 06:22.947
YOU AND IF YOU
LET ME HELP YOU.

06:22.991 --> 06:25.776
LOOK. I GOT TO GO, OK?

06:25.820 --> 06:27.865
-WE'LL PICK THIS UP LATER?
-MM-HMM.

06:38.528 --> 06:40.748
TO BE CLEAR,
YOU THINK

06:40.791 --> 06:43.446
I PULLED OUT A TUBE
OF MY LIPSTICK,

06:43.490 --> 06:46.318
WROTE THIS NOTE,
HUNTED YOU DOWN,

06:46.362 --> 06:48.059
AND THEN TOSSED IT
AT OUR FEET

06:48.103 --> 06:50.410
BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING BETTER TO DO?

06:50.453 --> 06:52.803
SAFIYAH SEEMS
TO THINK SO.

06:52.847 --> 06:54.457
I TOLD YOU,
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING

06:54.501 --> 06:55.850
TO DO WITH KATE KANE,

06:55.893 --> 06:58.113
AND I DIDN'T
SEND THIS NOTE,

06:58.156 --> 07:00.071
AND I THINK IF YOU
REALLY BELIEVED

07:00.115 --> 07:02.378
I TRIED TO BLOW UP
YOUR SISTER'S AIRPLANE,

07:02.422 --> 07:04.336
THIS CONVERSATION
WOULD LOOK A LOT MORE

07:04.380 --> 07:07.601
LIKE YOU FUMBLING
TO KILL ME AGAIN.

07:07.644 --> 07:09.559
I WASN'T FUMBLING.

07:09.603 --> 07:11.822
I WAS DUE-DILIGENCING.

07:11.866 --> 07:16.044
IT WILL BE VERY CLEAR
WHEN I TRANSITION
TO ACTUAL MURDER.

07:16.087 --> 07:17.828
HMM. I'M SURE.

07:17.872 --> 07:19.482
LOOK. I'M A BOTANIST.

07:19.526 --> 07:21.789
I WORK ALONE,
I KEEP TO MYSELF.

07:21.832 --> 07:24.182
THE IDEA OF PICKING
A FIGHT WITH A WARLORD

07:24.226 --> 07:25.793
SOUNDS LIKE
A LOT OF WORK.

07:25.836 --> 07:27.577
TRUST ME.
IT'S A FULL-TIME JOB.

07:27.621 --> 07:30.101
SO WHY DOES SHE THINK
THAT YOU TRIED TO FRAME HER

07:30.145 --> 07:31.581
FOR MY SISTER'S DEATH?

07:31.625 --> 07:33.365
WHY DON'T YOU
ASK HER YOURSELF?

07:33.409 --> 07:35.890
THE LAST THING I NEED
IS TO BE IN THE MIDDLE

07:35.933 --> 07:38.849
OF TWO CRAZY BITCHES
TRYING TO RIP
EACH OTHER'S HAIR OUT.

07:38.893 --> 07:40.329
HAVE A NICE LIFE.

07:44.289 --> 07:46.466
DOESN'T IT BOTHER YOU
THAT WE BOTH

07:46.509 --> 07:49.425
MAGICALLY FORGOT BEING
ON CORYANA TOGETHER,

07:49.469 --> 07:53.124
THAT THERE WERE OBVIOUSLY
PIECES OF BOTH OUR
MEMORIES WIPED?

07:53.168 --> 07:55.387
I GROW PSYCHEDELIC
MUSHROOMS FOR A LIVING.

07:55.431 --> 07:59.000
YOU THINK IT'S
THE FIRST MEMORY
I'VE LOST.

07:59.043 --> 08:02.046
BUT DID YOU FORGET
THAT SHE HAS AN ARMY?

08:02.090 --> 08:05.006
THOSE GUYS SHE SENT
ARE JUST THE BEGINNING,
AND YOU KNOW IT.

08:05.049 --> 08:07.530
EVEN IF YOU RUN
TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH,

08:07.574 --> 08:10.925
SHE HAS PLENTY OF ASSASSINS
WITH POINTY WEAPONS

08:10.968 --> 08:12.709
AND A LOT
OF FREQUENT FLYER MILES,

08:12.753 --> 08:16.017
SO WHY DOES SHE THINK
YOU FRAMED HER?

08:16.060 --> 08:18.802
I TRAINED HER ARMY.

08:18.846 --> 08:20.238
I FOLLOWED HER RULES,

08:20.282 --> 08:22.676
I WAS A GOOD
LITTLE SOLDER,

08:22.719 --> 08:27.550
AND THEN I GOT BORED.

08:27.594 --> 08:30.031
-YOU TRIED TO LEAVE.
-UH-UH.

08:30.074 --> 08:31.989
NOT JUST LEAVE.

08:32.033 --> 08:34.078
I TRIED TO LEAVE
WITH ONE OF HER
PRECIOUS FLOWERS.

08:34.122 --> 08:35.993
I THOUGHT I COULD
GROW IT HERE,
DO SOME GOOD,

08:36.037 --> 08:37.560
MAKE A DECENT LIVING.

08:37.604 --> 08:40.563
I GOT BUSTED,
AND SHE EXILED ME.

08:40.607 --> 08:45.133
SO YOU GOT TO LEAVE,
JUST WITHOUT YOUR LITTLE,
GREEN PARTING GIFT.

08:45.176 --> 08:46.613
WOKE UP
IN GOTHAM HARBOR

08:46.656 --> 08:47.962
WITH THE WORST
HANGOVER OF LIFE.

08:48.005 --> 08:49.354
MEANING YOU DIDN'T
REMEMBER THE HOW,

08:49.398 --> 08:53.489
THE WHERE,
THE WITH WHOMS.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.143
ARE YOU READY TO HEAR
WHAT I THINK?

08:55.186 --> 08:58.842
I'VE HAD AN OPTION
THIS WHOLE TIME?

08:58.886 --> 09:02.150
I THINK THAT YOU
DIDN'T GET CAUGHT

09:02.193 --> 09:04.587
TRYING TO LEAVE THE ISLAND
WITH THE DESERT ROSE.

09:04.631 --> 09:07.459
BASED ON MY LITTLE--
TCH--HOT FLASHES,

09:07.503 --> 09:10.767
I THINK WE GOT CAUGHT...
TOGETHER,

09:10.811 --> 09:14.205
AND I THINK SHE LET US
KEEP ALL OUR MEMORIES

09:14.249 --> 09:17.339
EXCEPT THE ONES
SPECIFICALLY

09:17.382 --> 09:18.688
WITH EACH OTHER.

09:23.693 --> 09:26.870
CAN YOU BELIEVE
THE AUDACITY OF THAT LAWYER?

09:26.914 --> 09:29.264
HE KNOWS EVERYTHING
THAT YOU WENT THROUGH
WITH BETH,

09:29.307 --> 09:31.048
AND NOW HE'S TRYING
TO BROWBEAT YOU

09:31.092 --> 09:33.616
INTO DECLARING
ANOTHER DAUGHTER DEAD

09:33.660 --> 09:36.053
SO THAT HE CAN,
WHAT, CLAIM HIS 3%

09:36.097 --> 09:37.925
OF KATE'S
MULTIMILLION-DOLLAR ESTATE?

09:37.968 --> 09:40.710
UHH. IT'S DISGUSTING.
HE SHOULD HAVE
HIS LICENSE REVOKED.

09:40.754 --> 09:42.451
YOU KNOW, IF THIS
MED SCHOOL THING
DOESN'T WORK OUT,

09:42.494 --> 09:43.713
THERE'S ALWAYS
LITIGATION.

09:43.757 --> 09:47.064
HEH. THANKS
FOR BRINGING ME.

09:49.110 --> 09:50.459
MOORE,
WHAT'D YOU FIND?

09:50.502 --> 09:52.592
-THE NAPIER'S A FAKE.
-WHAT?

09:52.635 --> 09:54.332
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?

09:54.376 --> 09:56.508
IT'S PIG'S BLOOD.
ACCORDING TO OUR FORENSICS TECH,

09:56.552 --> 09:58.206
THE REAL JACK NAPIER
WOULD HAVE FAVORED

09:58.249 --> 10:02.210
A MORE...
BIOLOGICALLY HUMAN PIGMENTATION.

10:02.253 --> 10:03.777
SO IT'S A DEAD END.

10:03.820 --> 10:06.344
NOT EXACTLY.
WE FOUND A PARTIAL PRINT,

10:06.388 --> 10:09.130
I.D.ed THE FORGER TO
A 30-SOMETHING MALE IN GOTHAM.

10:09.173 --> 10:10.958
WELL, THAT MEANS
THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE

10:11.001 --> 10:12.524
HE KNOWS
A HELL OF A LOT
ABOUT THE ORIGINAL.

10:12.568 --> 10:14.222
-WHAT'S HIS NAME?
-OCEAN,

10:14.265 --> 10:15.789
THE GUY ALICE
IS LOOKING FOR,

10:15.832 --> 10:17.399
AND NOW WE KNOW WHY.

10:17.442 --> 10:19.053
I MIGHT BE ABLE
TO TRACK HIM DOWN,

10:19.096 --> 10:20.620
BUT I NEED PERMISSION
TO USE THE HIGH-FREQUENCY

10:20.663 --> 10:22.099
GENERATOR RECEIVER.

10:22.143 --> 10:24.667
-GRANTED. GET IT DONE.
-COPY THAT, SIR.

10:24.711 --> 10:26.626
OK. I GIVE UP.

10:26.669 --> 10:29.063
WHAT'S A HIGH-FREQUENCY
GENERATOR REC--

10:50.475 --> 10:51.999
NOT OPEN YET.

10:52.042 --> 10:54.001
THE DOOR WAS.

10:54.044 --> 10:55.785
GOOD TO SEE YOU
STAYING OUT OF TROUBLE.

10:55.829 --> 10:57.961
GOOD TO HAVE
YOUR APPROVAL THAT...

10:58.005 --> 10:59.876
I DON'T CARE ABOUT.

10:59.920 --> 11:01.791
STILL NOT OPEN.

11:01.835 --> 11:04.620
I'VE BEEN BUILDING A CASE
ON YOUR GIRL ANGELIQUE MARTIN.

11:04.664 --> 11:07.057
LOOKS LIKE SNAKEBITE'S
HER NEW MONEY MAKER.

11:07.101 --> 11:11.018
HER NAME'S LINKED
TO 5 OUTSTANDING
POSSESSION CASES.

11:11.061 --> 11:14.630
PARTY KIDS,
NO LOYALTY.

11:14.674 --> 11:16.806
WHAT DO YOU WANT,
CROW-PHIE?

11:16.850 --> 11:18.895
SHE'S THE LITTLE FISH.

11:18.939 --> 11:21.202
I'M LOOKING
FOR HER SUPPLIER,

11:21.245 --> 11:23.160
A GROWER LINKED
TO THE PSYCHEDELIC MUSHROOMS

11:23.204 --> 11:26.860
BEING USED IN SNAKEBITE.
GOES BY OCEAN.

11:26.903 --> 11:28.383
NEVER HEARD OF HIM.

11:28.426 --> 11:29.906
ANGELIQUE HAS.

11:29.950 --> 11:32.648
I SAW HER AT HIS APARTMENT
BEFORE HE SPLIT.

11:32.692 --> 11:34.650
I JUST NEED YOUR HELP
GETTING HIS NEW LOCATION
FROM HER.

11:34.694 --> 11:38.698
SURE. I'LL JUST
CASUALLY TEXT HER
AND ASK.

11:40.787 --> 11:42.745
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
ASK HER ANYTHING.

11:42.789 --> 11:45.095
ONCE THIS IS WITHIN
RANGE OF HER CELL,

11:45.139 --> 11:48.708
IT'LL INSTALL AN INVISIBLE
HIGH-FREQUENCY GENERATOR
RECEIVER APP.

11:48.751 --> 11:52.059
ESSENTIALLY TURNS
HER CELL INTO A DIGITAL
AND AUDIO MICROPHONE.

11:52.102 --> 11:54.583
I JUST NEED YOU TO GET IT
CLOSE ENOUGH TO TRANSFER.

11:54.626 --> 11:56.759
YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS
RIGHT NOW.

11:56.803 --> 12:00.328
AS SERIOUS AS YOUR GIRL
DOING 8 TO 10 AT BLACKGATE.

12:00.371 --> 12:03.505
OK. FIRST OF ALL,
TECHNOLOGY LIKE THIS

12:03.548 --> 12:06.160
SHOULD NOT EXIST
IN A FREE SOCIETY.

12:06.203 --> 12:08.510
SECOND, SCREW YOU.

12:08.553 --> 12:12.383
I'M NOT BETRAYING
MY GIRLFRIEND.

12:12.427 --> 12:13.776
THIS IS THE SAME ANGELIQUE

12:13.820 --> 12:16.779
WHO LET YOU TAKE
THE FALL FOR HER, RIGHT,

12:16.823 --> 12:19.086
WHO CONTINUES TO SELL

12:19.129 --> 12:21.131
EVEN AFTER YOU SERVED
TIME FOR BEING CAUGHT

12:21.175 --> 12:23.655
WITH HER DRUGS ON YOU?

12:23.699 --> 12:25.919
DO THE RIGHT THING
HERE, RYAN.

12:30.184 --> 12:33.622
I'LL GET YOU
THE INFORMATION
YOU WANT,

12:33.665 --> 12:36.103
AND THEN THIS FILE
RIGHT HERE,

12:36.146 --> 12:38.322
IT DISAPPEARS.

12:38.366 --> 12:40.368
IS THAT CLEAR?

12:40.411 --> 12:43.414
I DO THIS,
YOU CAN'T TOUCH HER.

12:43.458 --> 12:45.634
YOU CAN'T
PROTECT HER FOREVER.

12:45.677 --> 12:49.812
NO, BUT I CAN
PROTECT HER FROM YOU.

12:49.856 --> 12:52.119
IS THAT CLEAR?

12:52.162 --> 12:53.511
CRYSTAL.

13:03.434 --> 13:05.959
-MARY?
-I'M FINE. I'M FINE.

13:06.002 --> 13:08.700
-HE DIDN'T HURT ME.
-UGH.

13:08.744 --> 13:10.615
WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

13:10.659 --> 13:12.226
I DON'T KNOW.

13:12.269 --> 13:15.751
LOOKS LIKE SOME SORT
OF UNDERGROUND CLINIC...

13:15.795 --> 13:18.972
NOT THAT I'VE
EVER SEEN ONE.

13:19.015 --> 13:20.887
FINALLY. OK.

13:20.930 --> 13:23.890
HI. FIRST HOSTAGE.

13:23.933 --> 13:25.979
HEH. UNFORTUNATELY, NO.

13:26.022 --> 13:28.285
NO. I MEAN ME.
I'VE NEVER DONE
THIS BEFORE,

13:28.329 --> 13:30.461
BUT IF ALL
GOES RIGHT--

13:31.636 --> 13:34.378
ALL GOES RIGHT--

13:34.422 --> 13:35.858
NOW I FORGOT WHAT
I WAS GONNA SAY!

13:37.294 --> 13:40.994
SORRY. SPONTANEOUS
RAGE ISSUES!

13:41.037 --> 13:43.953
M-MY BRAIN'S
A LITTLE WONKY.

13:43.997 --> 13:46.042
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

13:46.086 --> 13:47.696
THE ANTIDOTE.
THE ANTIDOTE

13:47.739 --> 13:49.741
HAMILTON USED
ON THE BAT TOXIN.

13:49.785 --> 13:51.004
WE DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO DO

13:51.047 --> 13:52.875
WITH HAMILTON DYNAMICS
ANYMORE.

13:52.919 --> 13:54.659
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THE ANTIDOTE.

13:54.703 --> 13:56.879
I'M NOT TALKING
TO YOU.

13:56.923 --> 13:58.838
I'M TALKING TO HER.

13:58.881 --> 14:00.709
THEY SAID IT'S
SOMEWHERE IN THIS
UNDERGROUND LAB,

14:00.752 --> 14:02.319
SO WHERE IS IT?

14:02.363 --> 14:03.886
SHE DOESN'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT IT EITHER.

14:03.930 --> 14:05.670
ACTUALLY, I KNOW LITERALLY
EVERYTHING ABOUT IT.

14:05.714 --> 14:07.281
THERE'S NONE LEFT.

14:10.153 --> 14:12.286
-NO!
-AAH!

14:12.329 --> 14:14.244
OH, I CAN'T KILL HER.
I NEED HER.

14:18.161 --> 14:20.468
W-WHERE DID YOU
GET IT?

14:20.511 --> 14:22.818
LONG STORY SHORT,
ON THE NIGHT

14:22.862 --> 14:25.125
A TOTAL BITCH
NAMED ALICE

14:25.168 --> 14:27.170
POISONED MY MOM AND ME,

14:27.214 --> 14:29.042
SHE GAVE ME THE CURE,
AKA THE SERUM,

14:29.085 --> 14:30.739
FROM THIS FABLED
ISLAND FLOWER.

14:30.782 --> 14:33.481
IT'S CALLED
THE DESERT ROSE, OK,

14:33.524 --> 14:35.309
BUT A FEW MONTHS LATER,

14:35.352 --> 14:38.312
I HAD THIS BLOOD--
WELL, LET'S JUST
CALL IT A TRANSFUSION,

14:38.355 --> 14:40.967
AND IT WAS NO LONGER
IN MY SYSTEM ANYMORE,

14:41.010 --> 14:44.927
BUT, UNBEKNOWNST TO ME,
ALICE STOLE A PINT
OF THE TRANSFUSION BLOOD,

14:44.971 --> 14:47.887
AND ON THE NIGHT
OF THE BAT ATTACK,
SHE GAVE IT BACK TO ME.

14:47.930 --> 14:49.845
SHE GAVE IT BACK TO ME,
AND SHE SAID IT WOULD
SAVE EVERYONE

14:49.889 --> 14:52.500
BECAUSE IT STILL CONTAINED
THE DESERT ROSE.

14:52.543 --> 14:56.112
I GAVE IT TO HAMILTON,
AND I TOLD THEM
TO MAKE AN ANTIDOTE.

14:56.156 --> 14:58.593
TO MY SHOCK,
IT ACTUALLY WORKED.

14:58.636 --> 15:00.812
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
ABOUT THIS?

15:00.856 --> 15:02.727
WOULD YOU HAVE
BELIEVED ME?

15:04.642 --> 15:06.079
I BELIEVE YOU,

15:06.122 --> 15:08.733
AND I NEED YOU
TO MAKE MORE.

15:08.777 --> 15:11.040
DON'T YOU THINK
THAT I TRIED?

15:11.084 --> 15:14.130
THE SOLUTION ONLY RETAINS
STABILITY AFTER ONE GENERATION.

15:14.174 --> 15:15.915
-HUH?
-HAMILTON DOCTORS

15:15.958 --> 15:17.917
COULD EXTRACT IT
FROM MY BLOOD

15:17.960 --> 15:19.744
TO TREAT PATIENTS
WITH IT,

15:19.788 --> 15:21.398
BUT ONCE IT'S BEEN
EXTRACTED FROM
THE SECOND BLOODSTREAM,

15:21.442 --> 15:23.357
IT LOSES ITS
CURATIVE PROPERTIES.

15:23.400 --> 15:25.489
TRUST ME. I WOULD
LOVE NOTHING MORE

15:25.533 --> 15:28.144
THAN TO BE THE ONE
WHO FINDS THE CURE
FOR BLOOD DISEASE.

15:28.188 --> 15:32.932
YAGH! UGH! UGH!

15:32.975 --> 15:34.672
ARGH!

15:34.716 --> 15:37.371
YOU'RE LEARNING ALL
THIS AT GOTHAM U., ARE YOU?

15:37.414 --> 15:40.722
NO, DAD. I'M NOT.

15:40.765 --> 15:42.637
OH, GOD.

15:42.680 --> 15:46.815
THIS ISN'T THE WAY
THAT I WANTED TO TELL YOU,

15:46.858 --> 15:51.907
BUT I'VE...BEEN PRACTICING
UNDERGROUND MEDICINE
FOR TWO YEARS.

15:51.951 --> 15:54.823
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
UNDERGROUND MEDICINE?

15:54.866 --> 16:00.176
I MEAN, THE REASON
WHY HE'S HERE LOOKING
FOR THE ANTIDOTE

16:00.220 --> 16:02.962
IS BECAUSE THE ANTIDOTE
CAME FROM HERE.

16:04.702 --> 16:06.704
THIS IS MY CLINIC.

16:17.237 --> 16:19.848
DAMN IT.

16:21.806 --> 16:24.505
OH,
I KNOW YOUR CLIENT
IS A MAJOR STAR

16:24.548 --> 16:27.160
AND WAY TOO BUSY
TO WALK TO AN ATM,

16:27.203 --> 16:29.031
BUT THAT STILL
DOESN'T CHANGE
THE FACT

16:29.075 --> 16:31.991
THAT I DON'T USE
CASH APPS.

16:34.123 --> 16:36.299
THIS ISN'T HER SAVE
THE PIGS CHARITY.

16:36.343 --> 16:38.345
BYE.

16:38.388 --> 16:39.824
MM-HMM.

16:42.088 --> 16:45.178
WHAT?

16:45.221 --> 16:48.485
YOU KEPT THE PLANT

16:48.529 --> 16:53.142
I GAVE YOU, WHAT,
LIKE, 5 YEARS AGO?

16:53.186 --> 16:56.015
YOU'RE SOFT, BABE.

16:56.058 --> 16:57.625
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

16:59.496 --> 17:01.846
HOPEFUL...

17:01.890 --> 17:03.370
BECAUSE...

17:08.766 --> 17:10.725
I DON'T GET IT.

17:10.768 --> 17:14.120
IT'S YOUR UNIFORM
FOR YOUR NEW JOB
AT THE HOLD-UP.

17:14.163 --> 17:17.949
IT'S LEGIT,
AND I CAN PROTECT YOU.

17:17.993 --> 17:21.910
-OH. YOU WILL PROTECT ME?
-YEAH.

17:21.953 --> 17:23.607
-OK.
-BECAUSE YOU SAID

17:23.651 --> 17:25.218
YOU WANTED OUT.

17:25.261 --> 17:30.571
THIS IS ME GIVING
YOU A WAY OUT.

17:30.614 --> 17:34.792
THAT'S VERY,
VERY SWEET, RY.

17:34.836 --> 17:36.577
GOOD BECAUSE YOU
START TOMORROW,

17:36.620 --> 17:38.274
AND GAYS ORDER
SOME WEIRD-ASS DRINKS

17:38.318 --> 17:39.580
THAT YOU HAVE
TO LEARN HOW TO--

17:39.623 --> 17:42.409
I DON'T WANT OUT.

17:42.452 --> 17:45.325
-WAIT, BUT YOU SAID THAT YOU--
-I LIED.

17:45.368 --> 17:46.891
I LIKE MY JOB.

17:46.935 --> 17:48.850
I'M GOOD AT IT.

17:48.893 --> 17:50.852
PEOPLE ACTUALLY
RESPECT ME.

17:50.895 --> 17:52.636
WHAT PEOPLE?

17:52.680 --> 17:56.031
YOU SLING
TO INFLUENCERS.

17:56.075 --> 17:59.165
SORRY I'M NOT LIVING UP
TO YOUR MORAL STANDARDS,

17:59.208 --> 18:01.993
BUT SOME OF US DIDN'T
GET BRANGELINAED
FROM THE GROUP HOME.

18:02.037 --> 18:03.517
WHAT IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

18:03.560 --> 18:05.040
SOMEBODY FOUND YOU, RY,

18:05.084 --> 18:07.608
AND YOU GOT A NEW LIFE.

18:07.651 --> 18:09.566
I DIDN'T.

18:09.610 --> 18:13.962
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT
FELT LIKE TO BE FOUND
BY SOMETHING.

18:14.005 --> 18:15.877
NOW I DO.

18:15.920 --> 18:17.705
I WENT TO PRISON
FOR YOU.

18:17.748 --> 18:19.837
AND I HAVE APOLOGIZED
FOR THAT.

18:19.881 --> 18:23.014
IT DOESN'T COUNT
IF YOU DON'T CHAN--
OH, MY GOD!

18:24.494 --> 18:25.974
-I CAN'T--
-RY.

18:26.017 --> 18:28.237
THE ROOM IS SPINNING.
AAH!

18:28.281 --> 18:29.586
WHAT--WHAT CAN I DO?

18:29.630 --> 18:32.546
MY MEDICINE'S
IN THE BATHROOM.

18:38.160 --> 18:39.640
WHAT IS HAPPENING TO ME?

18:53.132 --> 18:55.177
I THINK THEY'RE
UNDERNEATH THE SINK.

18:57.353 --> 18:58.920
I DON'T SEE THEM.

18:58.963 --> 19:00.487
ARE YOU SURE?

19:00.530 --> 19:03.011
THEY SHOULD BE
UNDER THERE.

19:10.975 --> 19:12.803
THEY WERE
IN THE MEDICINE CABINET.

19:16.372 --> 19:18.026
-MMM.
-I NEED TO GO CHECK IN

19:18.069 --> 19:19.332
ON SOME PEOPLE.

19:19.375 --> 19:22.248
TAKE THESE, PLEASE,

19:22.291 --> 19:25.642
AND I'M NOT SAYING
THAT AS SOME
SHADY DEALER.

19:42.746 --> 19:45.488
CONSIDER THIS MISFILED.

19:45.532 --> 19:47.316
I KNOW THIS WAS
HARD FOR YOU.

19:47.360 --> 19:49.536
BUT YOU DON'T,
THOUGH,

19:49.579 --> 19:52.669
BECAUSE YOU DON'T
KNOW WHAT WE'VE
BEEN THROUGH.

19:52.713 --> 19:54.932
I KNOW YOU'RE RIGHT BACK
IN THE EXACT SAME SITUATION

19:54.976 --> 19:56.238
YOU ALREADY SERVED TIME FOR,

19:56.282 --> 19:59.459
AND YOU'RE CHOOSING
TO STAY THERE.

19:59.502 --> 20:00.982
WHY?

20:01.025 --> 20:03.637
YOU'VE NEVER BEEN
IN LOVE, HUH?

20:03.680 --> 20:05.421
OF COURSE I'VE
BEEN IN LOVE.

20:05.465 --> 20:08.032
AND NOW YOU'RE ALONE.

20:08.076 --> 20:10.818
SEE, WHEN I CARE
ABOUT SOMEONE,

20:10.861 --> 20:12.515
I FIGHT FOR THEM.

20:22.351 --> 20:23.744
RYAN SPEAKING.

20:23.787 --> 20:25.267
MS. WILDER, THIS
IS DR. RODRIGUEZ

20:25.311 --> 20:26.747
FROM GOTHAM CITY GENERAL.

20:26.790 --> 20:28.270
I'D LIKE YOU TO COME IN
FOR RETESTING.

20:28.314 --> 20:29.837
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH THE FIRST TEST?

20:29.880 --> 20:31.578
UNFORTUNATELY, I THINK
THERE WAS A CONTAMINATION

20:31.621 --> 20:32.840
WITH THE SAMPLE.

20:32.883 --> 20:34.450
CONTAMINATION? WHAT?

20:34.494 --> 20:36.670
LAB CONTAMINANTS.
WE'RE PICKING UP A PRESENCE

20:36.713 --> 20:38.367
OF RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL,

20:38.411 --> 20:40.935
SO UNLESS YOU WERE TAKING
SELFIES AT CHERNOBYL,

20:40.978 --> 20:42.893
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE
READOUTS LIKE THESE.

20:42.937 --> 20:44.678
THE FRONT DESK WILL
GIVE YOU A CALL TO SET UP
AN APPOINTMENT.

20:44.721 --> 20:46.114
HAVE A GOOD DAY.

20:51.815 --> 20:55.297
OK. YOU'RE GONNA NEED
TO LEARN TO MAKE MORE
OF THAT SERUM

20:55.341 --> 20:58.213
RIGHT NOW,
OR HE DIES.

20:58.257 --> 21:01.434
I TOLD YOU THERE IS
NO ANTIDOTE.

21:01.477 --> 21:03.262
THERE IS NONE.

21:06.874 --> 21:08.267
-UNH!
-AAH!

21:11.705 --> 21:12.749
WHO ARE YOU WORKING FOR?

21:12.793 --> 21:14.447
NO, NO, NO.
NO NAMES.

21:14.490 --> 21:16.231
THAT'S THE RULES.
GAH!

21:16.275 --> 21:17.450
AGH!

21:20.366 --> 21:21.758
PAIN MEDS.

21:21.802 --> 21:23.891
FAR CAB--
FAR CABINET.

21:23.934 --> 21:27.329
OVER THERE. FAR CABINET.

21:27.373 --> 21:29.200
DID HE HIT
YOUR CELIAC ARTERY?

21:29.244 --> 21:31.202
I'M FINE.
I'M MORE CONCERNED

21:31.246 --> 21:33.030
WITH HOW I COULD
BE BLIND TO YET
ANOTHER DAUGHTER'S

21:33.074 --> 21:35.163
SECRET LIFE.

21:35.206 --> 21:36.512
HEH. IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

21:36.556 --> 21:38.688
WHEN YOU MET MY MOM,
ALL OF YOUR ENERGY

21:38.732 --> 21:41.561
WAS FOCUSED
ON FINDING BETH,

21:41.604 --> 21:44.433
AND THEN WHEN YOU
COULDN'T FIND HER,

21:44.477 --> 21:46.566
IT WAS ABOUT BUILDING
THE CROWS,

21:46.609 --> 21:51.832
AND NOW...IT'S ALL
ABOUT FINDING KATE.

21:51.875 --> 21:54.835
TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS

21:54.878 --> 21:56.880
I'VE NEVER REALLY
BEEN ON YOUR RADAR.

21:56.924 --> 21:58.665
MARY.

21:58.708 --> 22:00.580
IT'S OK.

22:00.623 --> 22:02.538
I COULD TELL HIM
ABOUT CORYANA.

22:02.582 --> 22:04.410
NO. ABSOLUTELY NOT.

22:04.453 --> 22:05.933
HE'S GONNA KILL YOU.

22:05.976 --> 22:07.500
IF HE KILLS ME,
HE'S GOT NOTHING.

22:07.543 --> 22:09.893
I HAVE HAD YEARS
OF RESISTANCE TRAINING.

22:09.937 --> 22:11.634
I'LL BE FINE.

22:19.555 --> 22:23.342
THAT CRANIOTOMY SCAR,

22:23.385 --> 22:24.995
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE
TRYING TO HEAL?

22:33.308 --> 22:38.400
SHRINKS CALLED ME
AMYGDALA,

22:38.444 --> 22:40.228
SAID I HAD MY
CIRCUITS MIXED UP,

22:40.271 --> 22:42.448
THAT I REACTED
WRONG TO THINGS.

22:42.491 --> 22:44.754
SAW A PUPPY,
I GOT PISSED OFF.

22:44.798 --> 22:47.453
SAW A KID CRYING,
IT CRACKED ME UP.

22:47.496 --> 22:50.325
THEN 5 YEARS AGO,
THE DOCTORS DECIDED

22:50.369 --> 22:51.935
I'D BE THE PERFECT
LAB RAT

22:51.979 --> 22:53.981
FOR THIS SECRET
EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENT,

22:54.024 --> 22:55.809
SO THEY FRIED
THE BAD PARTS
OF MY BRAIN

22:55.852 --> 22:59.160
WITH UV LIGHT.

22:59.203 --> 23:02.424
SOME TWO DOZEN
TREATMENTS LATER,
I GO TO A MOVIE.

23:02.468 --> 23:05.209
I'M SITTING THERE.
AT ONE POINT,

23:05.253 --> 23:07.951
I STARTED LAUGHING,

23:07.995 --> 23:10.650
AND THEN I HEAR
EVERYBODY ELSE
AROUND ME,

23:10.693 --> 23:13.304
AND THEY WERE
LAUGHING, TOO.

23:13.348 --> 23:16.482
THAT HAD NEVER
HAPPENED BEFORE.

23:16.525 --> 23:20.181
FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN MY LIFE,
I--I FELT NORMAL.

23:20.224 --> 23:23.271
THE UV EXPOSURE,
IT WORKED?

23:23.314 --> 23:27.667
IT DID...FOR A WEEK,

23:27.710 --> 23:33.281
AND THEN CANCER
BLOOMED IN MY BRAIN
LIKE A CHERRY BLOSSOM.

23:33.324 --> 23:36.153
SOMETIMES,
THE TUMOR RUBS UP

23:36.197 --> 23:40.462
AGAINST MY AMYGDALA,
AND...

23:40.506 --> 23:42.638
AGH!
I HAVE

23:42.682 --> 23:43.987
AN UNFORTUNATE MOMENT!

23:44.031 --> 23:45.511
PLEASE, PLEASE,
PLEASE STOP, STOP!

23:45.554 --> 23:48.078
YOU DON'T WANT
TO DO THIS.

23:48.122 --> 23:50.472
YOU'RE GONNA KILL HIM.

23:50.516 --> 23:52.518
DON'T YOU GET IT?

23:52.561 --> 23:57.044
MY AMYGDALA IS
INFESTED WITH CANCER.

23:57.087 --> 24:01.396
HIS PAIN DOESN'T
COMPUTE WITH ME.

24:01.440 --> 24:04.530
I DON'T FEEL
ANYTHING BUT ANGRY.

24:04.573 --> 24:06.445
OK. THERE'S
MORE ANTIDOTE.

24:06.488 --> 24:07.924
-WHERE?
-MARY, NO.

24:07.968 --> 24:09.622
THERE'S AN ISLAND,
AND IF YOU CAN GET THERE,

24:09.665 --> 24:11.406
YOU CAN HAVE ALL THE CURE
THAT YOU WANT.

24:11.450 --> 24:14.496
JUST--JUST LET
MY DAD GO.

24:14.540 --> 24:17.064
HOW DO I GET THERE?

24:17.107 --> 24:18.413
SHE DOESN'T WANT
ANYONE KNOWING

24:18.457 --> 24:19.806
THE LOCATION
OF THE ISLAND,

24:19.849 --> 24:21.068
SO SHE BLITZED
MY MEMORY

24:21.111 --> 24:22.548
SO I CAN NEVER
GET BACK.

24:22.591 --> 24:24.201
SHE DIDN'T JUST
ERASE THAT DAY.

24:24.245 --> 24:25.376
SHE ERASED OUR
ENTIRE EXISTENCE
FROM EACH OTHER.

24:25.420 --> 24:27.117
THAT'S NOT
STRANGE TO YOU?

24:27.161 --> 24:28.554
YOU'RE RIGHT, ALICE.

24:28.597 --> 24:30.556
MAYBE YOU WERE
THE ONE BUSTED

24:30.599 --> 24:32.079
STEALING THE DESERT ROSE,

24:32.122 --> 24:33.515
AND MAYBE YOU
FRAMED ME

24:33.559 --> 24:35.082
TO SAVE
YOUR OWN ASS.

24:35.125 --> 24:37.084
I DON'T THINK
I WOULD HAVE DONE THAT.

24:37.127 --> 24:40.609
WHY? TOO HONORABLE?

24:40.653 --> 24:42.959
YOU HELPED ME GUT
3 MEN YESTERDAY.

24:43.003 --> 24:45.353
YOU REALLY DON'T
REMEMBER, DO YOU?

24:45.396 --> 24:46.615
REMEMBER WHAT?

24:57.191 --> 25:00.803
YOU AND I HAD
A THING TOGETHER.

25:00.847 --> 25:04.111
FROM THE LOOKS OF IT,
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN MEMORABLE.

25:07.375 --> 25:11.118
OH, CRAP.

25:11.161 --> 25:13.120
YEAH. MY THOUGHTS
EXACTLY.

25:15.296 --> 25:17.733
"KRYPTONITE
IS COMPRISED OF SODIUM,

25:17.777 --> 25:22.782
"LITHIUM, BORON, AND ELEMENTS
NOT FOUND ON EARTH.

25:22.825 --> 25:25.088
"AS A RESULT, THIS MAKES IT
THE SINGULAR MATERIAL

25:25.132 --> 25:27.743
"THAT CAN PENETRATE THE BATSUIT

25:27.787 --> 25:30.224
"AND THE ONLY FAILSAFE
THAT PROTECTS THE SUIT

25:30.267 --> 25:33.227
AGAINST CORRUPTION."

25:37.797 --> 25:39.973
HEY. THERE YOU ARE.

25:40.016 --> 25:41.757
YOU HAVEN'T
CHECKED IN ALL DAY.

25:41.801 --> 25:46.327
SORRY. I WAS BUSY
BETRAYING MY GIRLFRIEND

25:46.370 --> 25:49.199
SO YOUR CROW SOPHIE
CAN MAKE A DRUG BUST.

25:49.243 --> 25:52.072
-OH, YOU MEAN OCEAN.
-HOW DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT?

25:52.115 --> 25:54.117
SOPHIE TOLD ME THAT
HE FORGED THE FAKE
JACK NAPIER PAINTING

25:54.161 --> 25:55.945
AND MIGHT KNOW
WHERE THE REAL ONE IS.

25:55.989 --> 25:57.599
SO HER STORY ABOUT
HAVING A CASE
ON ANGELIQUE

25:57.643 --> 26:01.342
TO CATCH HER DEALER,
IT WAS ALL B.S.?

26:01.385 --> 26:03.562
NO. IT WAS NOT ALL B.S.
WE NEED OCEAN TO FIND KATE.

26:03.605 --> 26:05.259
WHAT DOES HE HAVE
TO DO WITH KATE?

26:05.302 --> 26:07.043
ACCORDING TO ALICE,
HE HAS TIES TO CORYANA,

26:07.087 --> 26:10.873
SO WE RAN A SEARCH,
BUT THE GUY'S
PRACTICALLY A GHOST.

26:10.917 --> 26:12.571
I'M GONNA NEED YOU
TO GO BACK TO THE PART

26:12.614 --> 26:14.790
WHERE YOU SAID,
"ACCORDING TO ALICE."

26:14.834 --> 26:17.140
WHEN WERE YOU
TALKING TO ALICE?

26:17.184 --> 26:20.317
YEAH. RIGHT.
SO AT SOPHIE'S CONDO
THE OTHER DAY,

26:20.361 --> 26:22.581
SHE WAS THERE,
AND WHEN I SHOWED UP,
SHE PULLED A GUN ON ME.

26:22.624 --> 26:26.149
AND THEN YOU LEFT
AND PROMPTLY CALLED 911.

26:31.024 --> 26:34.549
AND THEN YOU LEFT
AND PROMPTLY CALLED 911

26:34.593 --> 26:36.638
TO TELL THE COPS
THE LOCATION

26:36.682 --> 26:39.075
OF THE BITCH WHOSE GANG
KILLED MY MOM.

26:39.119 --> 26:43.384
RIGHT NOW, ALICE IS
OUR ONLY WAY TO CORYANA.

26:47.910 --> 26:49.303
IT'S MARY.

26:52.611 --> 26:54.787
HEY. UH,
NOT A GREAT TIME.

26:54.830 --> 26:57.485
LUCAS, HEY. I'M GONNA
NEED YOU TO BRING ME

26:57.528 --> 26:59.226
THAT MAP TO CORYANA.

26:59.269 --> 27:00.836
WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

27:00.880 --> 27:02.838
MY DAD AND I ARE HERE
AT MY CLINIC,

27:02.882 --> 27:04.666
AND HE ASKED TO SEE IT.

27:04.710 --> 27:06.494
WHAT THE HELL IS YOUR DAD
DOING AT THE CLINIC?

27:06.537 --> 27:09.453
I'LL TELL YOU AS SOON
AS YOU BRING ME THE MAP, OK?

27:09.497 --> 27:11.151
FAST AS YOU CAN,

27:11.194 --> 27:13.457
YOU KNOW, LIKE
A BAT OUT OF HELL.

27:13.501 --> 27:14.981
MARY, EVERYTHING GOOD?

27:15.024 --> 27:17.331
I'M FINE, LUCAS.
JUST BRING ME THE MAP.

27:17.374 --> 27:19.246
I'M NOT MESSING AROUND.

27:22.684 --> 27:25.078
HER DAD CAN'T KNOW
ABOUT THE CLINIC.

27:25.121 --> 27:28.690
SHE'S NEVER CALLED ME
LUCAS EVER, NOT ONCE.

27:28.734 --> 27:30.649
"A BAT OUT OF HELL"?

27:30.692 --> 27:32.738
SOMETHING'S WRONG.
I NEED TO GET TO HER.

27:32.781 --> 27:35.741
-OHH!
-WHOA. WHAT'S UP WITH YOU? HEY.

27:35.784 --> 27:38.744
NO, NO, NO. I JUST--
I JUST NEED SOME SPACE.

27:38.787 --> 27:40.093
OK. WHAT--WHAT CAN I--

27:40.136 --> 27:41.660
I DON'T NEED
YOUR--OHH!

27:41.703 --> 27:46.012
WHOA, RYAN,
RYAN, HEY.

27:46.055 --> 27:47.491
RYAN,
WHAT'S GOING ON?

27:51.757 --> 27:53.410
IT DOESN'T
MAKE SENSE.

27:53.454 --> 27:54.716
YOU'RE A PAINTER?
DO I HAVE TO

27:54.760 --> 27:56.631
DRAW YOU A...PICTURE?

27:56.675 --> 27:58.894
WHEN TWO PEOPLE DON'T HATE
EACH OTHER VERY MUCH...

27:58.938 --> 28:01.941
I MEAN, CORYANA
WAS REMOTE,

28:01.984 --> 28:04.770
BUT I WAS NEVER
DESPERATE.

28:04.813 --> 28:08.208
WELL...APPARENTLY,
I WAS.

28:08.251 --> 28:09.731
WHERE YOU GOING?

28:09.775 --> 28:12.734
TO CALL SAFIYAH'S
SIDE-CHICK.

28:12.778 --> 28:15.737
CAN I ASSUME
IT'S DONE?

28:15.781 --> 28:17.783
I WAS CALLING
YOUR HENCHMAN.

28:17.826 --> 28:19.828
DO YOU NORMALLY ANSWER
THE PHONE FOR YOUR
UNDERLINGS?

28:19.872 --> 28:21.830
IT'S NORMALLY NOT YOU.

28:21.874 --> 28:23.571
HOW ARE YOU, ALICE?

28:23.614 --> 28:26.052
I'VE NEVER ASKED
THIS TO A WOMAN, BUT...

28:26.095 --> 28:27.575
YOU DIDN'T HAPPEN
TO ROOFIE ME

28:27.618 --> 28:29.577
FOR 6 MONTHS STRAIGHT,
DID YOU,

28:29.620 --> 28:31.100
BECAUSE I'M HITTING
A LOT OF POTHOLES
ON MEMORY LANE

28:31.144 --> 28:32.536
THAT NEED FILLING.

28:32.580 --> 28:34.538
WHAT DID YOU
DO TO ME?

28:34.582 --> 28:37.498
I MADE YOU A WOMAN
WHO COULD PUT A KNIFE
THROUGH A MAN'S HEART.

28:37.541 --> 28:39.239
TELL ME EVERYTHING
YOU ERASED.

28:39.282 --> 28:41.458
HAPPY TO,
BUT FIRST, ASK YOURSELF,

28:41.502 --> 28:43.678
"IS THAT REALLY
WHAT I WANT?"

28:43.722 --> 28:46.725
WOULDN'T IT BE
SO MUCH EASIER NOT HAVING
AN EMOTIONAL ATTACHMENT

28:46.768 --> 28:48.814
TO THE MAN YOU'VE BEEN
TASKED TO KILL?

28:48.857 --> 28:50.772
WHY DON'T YOU ASK
SOMEONE WHO HAS
EMOTIONAL ATTACHMENTS?

28:50.816 --> 28:54.254
SAYS THE GIRL WILLING
TO DO ANYTHING TO GET
HER SISTER BACK.

28:57.344 --> 28:59.389
I WONDERED WHY YOU
TASKED ME WITH SUCH

28:59.433 --> 29:01.304
A SPECIFIC PIECE
OF WORK,

29:01.348 --> 29:04.655
AND...NOW I KNOW.

29:04.699 --> 29:07.006
SO YOU COULD SIT BACK
AND WATCH ME KILL

29:07.049 --> 29:10.836
AN OLD FLAME. HEH.

29:10.879 --> 29:12.489
YOU'RE SICK.

29:12.533 --> 29:14.491
NO, ALICE.
SICK WOULD TELLING YOU

29:14.535 --> 29:16.450
ALL THE DETAILS
OF YOUR STORY WITH OCEAN

29:16.493 --> 29:18.669
AND THEN ASKING YOU
TO KILL HIM,

29:18.713 --> 29:21.803
WHICH, AGAIN, I AM HAPPY
TO DO IF YOU SO DESIRE.

29:21.847 --> 29:24.197
LET ME KNOW
WHAT YOU DECIDE.

29:46.654 --> 29:49.657
DID THAT JUST
PULSATE?

29:49.700 --> 29:51.964
THIS IS WHY NO ONE
CAN HELP ME.

29:52.007 --> 29:53.574
THIS FROM
THE KRYPTONITE?

29:53.617 --> 29:55.358
YOU SAID YOU
WERE FINE.

30:00.929 --> 30:02.539
I THOUGHT I WAS.

30:02.583 --> 30:04.324
I KNEW IT COULD
PIERCE THE BATSUIT,

30:04.367 --> 30:06.326
BUT WHEN YOU SURVIVED
TOMMY SHOOTING YOU,

30:06.369 --> 30:08.067
I ASSUMED IT MEANT
IT WAS ONLY FATAL

30:08.110 --> 30:09.677
IF THE SHOT HIT
A VITAL ORGAN.

30:09.720 --> 30:12.332
NO. KRYPTONITE KILLS,

30:12.375 --> 30:14.421
JUST HELLA SLOW.

30:14.464 --> 30:16.597
WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY
ANYTHING?

30:16.640 --> 30:18.947
WHAT I WAS ABOUT TO
SAY AFTER I BEGGED
TO PUT ON THE SUIT?

30:18.991 --> 30:21.384
"HEY. GOT TO TAKE
A SICK DAY"?

30:21.428 --> 30:23.473
I SPEND EVERY SECOND
IN THAT THING

30:23.517 --> 30:27.913
TRYING TO CONVINCE
YOU I'M AT LEAST HALF
AS GOOD AS KATE.

30:27.956 --> 30:31.090
WASN'T ABOUT TO GIVE
YOU ONE MORE REASON
TO DOUBT ME.

30:31.133 --> 30:33.048
UM, I'M SORRY.

30:33.092 --> 30:34.441
WE DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR THIS.

30:34.484 --> 30:35.790
I NEED TO GET TO MARY.

30:35.834 --> 30:37.487
YOU CAN BARELY WALK.

30:37.531 --> 30:39.446
YOU CAN KEEP TELLING ME
EVERYTHING I CAN'T DO,

30:39.489 --> 30:41.361
OR YOU CAN MAKE
YOURSELF USEFUL

30:41.404 --> 30:43.537
AND HAVE MY BACK
FOR ONCE.

30:56.680 --> 30:58.552

32:51.447 --> 32:52.753
I GOT THE MAP.

32:52.796 --> 32:54.059
ANY CHANCE YOU KNOW
HOW TO READ A NAUTICAL CHART?

32:54.102 --> 32:55.060
NO, BUT YOU NEED TO
BRING IT TO THE CLINIC.

32:55.103 --> 32:56.539
I THINK SOMEONE'S
GOT MARY.

32:56.583 --> 32:58.063
SHE SAID HER DAD
IS WITH HER AND THAT
SHE NEEDS THE MAP.

32:58.106 --> 32:59.847
OH, MY GOD. OK.
I'M ON MY WAY.

32:59.890 --> 33:00.848
SHE SOUNDED
DEADLY SERIOUS,

33:00.891 --> 33:01.980
AND THIS GOES
WITHOUT SAYING,

33:02.023 --> 33:03.503
BUT YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY
HAND IT OVER.

33:03.546 --> 33:06.288
I WON'T, BUT I'M ALSO
NOT GONNA GAMBLE
WITH THEIR LIVES.

33:10.075 --> 33:11.467
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

33:11.511 --> 33:12.991
THAT ISLAND IS GROWING
THE ONLY THING

33:13.034 --> 33:15.341
ON THIS PLANET THAT HAS
A SHOT AT CURING ME.

33:15.384 --> 33:17.604
I'M NOT PUTTING MY LIFE
IN THE HANDS OF SOME CROW.

33:17.647 --> 33:19.475
LOOK, RYAN.

33:22.870 --> 33:24.872
THE SUIT CAN DISCHARGE
A SINGLE DOSE

33:24.915 --> 33:26.352
OF ADRENALINE.

33:26.395 --> 33:28.049
WHEN YOU NEED A BOOST,
SAY THE WORD.

33:29.877 --> 33:31.835
I GOT THIS.

33:31.879 --> 33:34.403
I KNOW.

33:34.447 --> 33:36.275
YOU'RE ONE OF THEM,
AREN'T YOU?

33:36.318 --> 33:39.539
I'M SO STUPID.
STUPID, STUPID!

33:39.582 --> 33:40.931
OHH. NO.

33:40.975 --> 33:43.412
STOP, STOP, STOP!

33:43.456 --> 33:45.588
STOP, STOP!
ONE OF WHO?

33:45.632 --> 33:47.199
JUST ANOTHER LYING
HAMILTON.

33:47.242 --> 33:48.765
WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

33:48.809 --> 33:51.072
HAMILTON DOCTORS
DID THIS TO YOU?

33:51.116 --> 33:52.508
IT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

33:52.552 --> 33:53.901
YOU SAID THIS HAPPENED
5 YEARS AGO.

33:53.944 --> 33:55.772
YEAH. MY MOM
WAS CEO THEN.

33:55.816 --> 33:57.774
SHE WOULD HAVE NEVER
SIGNED OFF ON SECRET
HUMAN TESTING.

33:57.818 --> 34:00.081
WHY DO YOU THINK
THEY CALL IT
SECRET, GENIUS?

34:00.125 --> 34:01.822
AND YOUR DOCTORS,
THEY PROMISED--

34:01.865 --> 34:05.695
THEY PROMISED,
THEY PROMISED
TO FIX ME!

34:05.739 --> 34:08.437
DID YOU KNOW THAT
THIS WAS HAPPENING?

34:08.481 --> 34:12.180
APPARENTLY THERE'S A LOT
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT.

34:12.224 --> 34:15.227
UNH!

34:15.270 --> 34:17.794
RAAH!

34:17.838 --> 34:19.753
OH, MY GOD!

34:19.796 --> 34:21.233
DROP IT,
OR I SHOOT!

34:30.198 --> 34:32.679
STOP, STOP!
SHE BROUGHT THE MAP!

34:32.722 --> 34:34.115
YOU'RE NOT A KILLER!

34:34.159 --> 34:35.769
YOUR FAMILY DID THIS
TO ME!

34:51.698 --> 34:52.916
HUH! HYAH!

34:57.138 --> 34:59.314
GET HER OUT OF HERE.
GO OUT THE BACK.

34:59.358 --> 35:01.621
I'M NOT LEAVING MY AGENT
IN A DAMN HALLWAY.

35:01.664 --> 35:04.319
I'LL PROTECT HER,
I PROMISE YOU.

35:04.363 --> 35:05.973
NOW GO!

35:18.855 --> 35:21.815
LUKE...NOW.

35:23.251 --> 35:25.558
OHH! HUH!

35:28.169 --> 35:31.694
BATWOMAN TO BATCAVE,
I GOT IT.

35:31.738 --> 35:33.435
THAT'S OK. HE'S--

35:38.701 --> 35:40.747
SEDATE HIM
IN THE CAR.

35:40.790 --> 35:42.183
WE DON'T NEED
ANY INCIDENTS.

35:42.227 --> 35:43.663
WHO ARE YOU?

35:43.706 --> 35:45.186
JUST A MAN LOOKING
FOR A MAP.

35:45.230 --> 35:47.188
DON'T GIVE IT TO HIM.

35:47.232 --> 35:49.843
I WILL SHOOT
THIS CROW IN THE HEAD.

35:49.886 --> 35:52.150
HER BLOOD WILL BE
ON YOUR HANDS,
BATWOMAN.

35:52.193 --> 35:56.066
IS THAT REALLY HOW
YOU WANT TO START
YOUR LEGACY?

35:56.110 --> 35:58.243
WE NEED THAT MAP.

35:58.286 --> 36:00.723
I KNOW....

36:00.767 --> 36:02.856
BUT I ALSO CAN'T
LET YOU DIE.

36:20.395 --> 36:22.354
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
SHE'S DYING?

36:22.397 --> 36:23.572
I LOOKED AT THE WOUND.

36:23.616 --> 36:24.878
THE MEDS WERE WORKING.

36:24.921 --> 36:26.096
WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL ME?

36:26.140 --> 36:27.576
SHE ASKED ME NOT TO.

36:27.620 --> 36:31.667
-BUT WE'RE THE BATTEAM.
-NOT TO HER.

36:31.711 --> 36:33.539
WELL, THE MEDS
AREN'T WORKING.

36:33.582 --> 36:35.280
HER PROLONGED EXPOSURE
TO THE KRYPTONITE RADIATION

36:35.323 --> 36:36.846
IS LETHAL.

36:36.890 --> 36:38.500
RYAN'S ONLY HOPE
IS THE DESERT ROSE,

36:38.544 --> 36:40.241
WHICH IS ON CORYANA
WITH KATE,

36:40.285 --> 36:42.504
WHO WE'RE NEVER
GONNA SEE AGAIN.

36:42.548 --> 36:46.378
SINCE PUTTING ON
THE SUIT, RYAN'S--

36:46.421 --> 36:48.684
RYAN'S MADE
THE STREETS SAFER,

36:48.728 --> 36:51.209
SHE'S INSPIRED THE CITY,

36:51.252 --> 36:52.862
AND SHE HELPED US
FIND KATE,

36:52.906 --> 36:54.560
AND SHE'S DONE IT ALL
WHILE HAVING

36:54.603 --> 36:58.390
A TERMINAL ILLNESS.

36:58.433 --> 37:02.132
I MEAN, IF THAT'S
NOT A HERO,
WHAT HE HELL IS?

37:02.176 --> 37:04.526
SO WE'RE GONNA
FIND CORYANA,

37:04.570 --> 37:06.136
WE'RE GONNA
GET KATE BACK,

37:06.180 --> 37:08.138
AND WE'RE GONNA
SAVE RYAN'S LIFE.

37:08.182 --> 37:10.750
EXCEPT WE HAVE NO WAY
OF DOING ANY
OF THOSE THINGS.

37:10.793 --> 37:13.927
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

37:13.970 --> 37:15.842
WE HAVE MY DAD.

37:18.410 --> 37:20.499
IF THESE PEOPLE HAVE
ANYTHING TO DO WITH HAMILTON,

37:20.542 --> 37:22.283
I WANT TO BE THE FIRST
TO KNOW ABOUT IT.

37:22.327 --> 37:24.851
I WANT THAT MAP IN MY HANDS.

37:28.246 --> 37:30.987
I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID
ANYTHING ABOUT CORYANA.

37:31.031 --> 37:32.598
YOU WERE ACTING
ON INSTINCT.

37:32.641 --> 37:36.297
THAT MAN WAS
TOTALLY UNHINGED.

37:36.341 --> 37:40.649
DO YOU THINK MOM
KNEW WHAT THEY WERE
DOING TO THAT GUY?

37:40.693 --> 37:42.738
I THINK YOUR MOM
WAS A LOT LIKE YOU,

37:42.782 --> 37:46.829
A WOMAN WHO WOULD DO
ANYTHING TO HELP PEOPLE.

37:46.873 --> 37:49.658
I KNOW YOU'RE PISSED
ABOUT THE CLINIC.

37:49.702 --> 37:51.660
I'M SHUTTING IT
DOWN, MARY.

37:51.704 --> 37:53.749
-WHY? WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?
-IT'S ILLEGAL.

37:53.793 --> 37:55.273
YEAH, BUT A LOT
OF PEOPLE IN GOTHAM

37:55.316 --> 37:57.840
CAN'T AFFORD HEALTH CARE
IN THE LEGAL WAY.

37:57.884 --> 38:00.713
PRACTICING WITHOUT A LICENSE,
IMPERSONATING A DOCTOR,

38:00.756 --> 38:02.715
POSSESSION OF NARCOTICS,
NEED I GO ON?

38:02.758 --> 38:05.065
I'VE SAVED HUNDREDS,
MAYBE THOUSANDS
OF LIVES,

38:05.108 --> 38:07.328
AND EVEN MORE
THAN THAT, I MAKE
PEOPLE FEEL LIKE

38:07.372 --> 38:09.330
THEY'RE WORTHY
OF BEING ALIVE!

38:09.374 --> 38:11.419
GOTHAM CITY GENERAL
CAN'T SAY THAT.

38:11.463 --> 38:13.987
I'M NOT QUESTIONING
YOUR PASSION OR THE GOOD
THAT YOU'VE DONE,

38:14.030 --> 38:15.989
BUT DID YOU NOT LISTEN
TO WHAT THE MAN SAID?

38:16.032 --> 38:18.426
THIS IS EXACTLY HOW
YOUR MOTHER STARTED--
WITH GOOD INTENTIONS

38:18.470 --> 38:21.081
AND A LOT OF DISAPPEARING
LINES IN THE SAND.

38:21.124 --> 38:23.388
MOM KNEW
ABOUT THE CLINIC.

38:23.431 --> 38:25.172
SHE WAS PROUD OF ME.

38:25.215 --> 38:29.132
SHE WAS CONDUCTING
HUMAN EXPERIMENTS, MARY.

38:29.176 --> 38:31.091
WELL, I WOULDN'T
DO THAT.

38:31.134 --> 38:33.354
EVERY SICK PERSON
WHO WALKS THROUGH
YOUR FRONT DOOR

38:33.398 --> 38:37.271
IS AN EXPERIMENT BECAUSE
YOU ARE NOT QUALIFIED.

38:39.055 --> 38:42.711
SO IS THIS WHAT BEING
A DAD MEANS TO YOU?

38:42.755 --> 38:45.801
YOU FINALLY PAY
ATTENTION TO ME,

38:45.845 --> 38:48.108
AND THEN YOU TAKE
AWAY THE THING

38:48.151 --> 38:50.415
THAT MEANS
THE MOST TO ME.

38:53.200 --> 38:55.724
I LIKED YOU BETTER
WHEN YOU ACTED LIKE
I DIDN'T EXIST.

39:03.253 --> 39:05.038
HEY.

39:05.081 --> 39:08.389
I DIDN'T
ACTUALLY THINK
YOU WOULD COME.

39:08.433 --> 39:09.869
I DID.

39:09.912 --> 39:11.871
YOU DON'T LOOK SO HOT.

39:11.914 --> 39:15.570
YEAH. IT'S KIND OF
WHAT I WANTED TO
TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

39:15.614 --> 39:17.224
IT'S SOMETHING
PRETTY SERIOUS.

39:17.267 --> 39:20.923
LIKE WHAT? NO. WAIT.
LET ME GUESS.

39:20.967 --> 39:23.796
COPS GOT YOU ON THE HOOK
FOR SOMETHING.

39:23.839 --> 39:25.319
WHY WOULD YOU
THINK THAT?

39:25.363 --> 39:27.060
I DON'T KNOW, RYAN.

39:27.103 --> 39:30.759
WHY WOULD I THINK THAT?

39:30.803 --> 39:33.414
I HAVE NO IDEA.

39:33.458 --> 39:36.722
IS IT MAYBE...

39:36.765 --> 39:41.466
BECAUSE YOU SLIPPED
SOME CREEPY SPY TECH
ONTO MY PHONE?

39:42.902 --> 39:44.512
OH, NO.

39:44.556 --> 39:46.645
I HEARD STATIC,
AND HALF MY APPS
STOPPED WORKING,

39:46.688 --> 39:48.255
AND MY TECH GUY
THINKS HE DELETED IT,

39:48.298 --> 39:50.953
BUT WHO KNOWS?

39:50.997 --> 39:54.217
THE FEDS COULD BE LISTENING
TO EVERY WORD OF THIS.

39:54.261 --> 39:57.264
I--I DID NOT
HAVE A CHOICE.

39:57.307 --> 40:00.789
YOU DID, THOUGH,
AND YOU CHOSE TO SNITCH.

40:00.833 --> 40:03.139
THEY HAD A CASE
ON YOU.

40:03.183 --> 40:05.794
YOU WOULD BE
IN A HOLDING CELL
RIGHT NOW.

40:05.838 --> 40:07.622
THAT'S NOT HOW
THIS WORKS, RYAN.

40:07.666 --> 40:09.711
THE COPS, THE CROWS,

40:09.755 --> 40:11.191
THEY'RE NOT THE ONES
I'M AFRAID OF.

40:11.234 --> 40:13.193
YOU KNOW WHAT?
MY BAD, ANG.

40:13.236 --> 40:17.502
I AM SO SORRY THAT
YOU CAN'T DRUG-DEAL
IN PEACE.

40:17.545 --> 40:21.506
I AM SO SORRY
I CANNOT TRUST YOU.

40:21.549 --> 40:23.246
OH, DON'T YOU DARE
TURN THIS AROUND ON ME!

40:23.290 --> 40:25.161
HOW DO I KNOW YOU DON'T
HAVE THIS WHOLE PLACE BUGGED?

40:25.205 --> 40:27.294
HOW DO I KNOW YOU'RE
EVEN WHO YOU SAY YOU ARE?

40:27.337 --> 40:30.471
BECAUSE YOU KNOW ME!

40:30.515 --> 40:34.301
YOU ARE THE ONLY
PERSON THAT KNOWS ME,

40:34.344 --> 40:35.737
AND I NEED YOU
RIGHT NOW,

40:35.781 --> 40:39.785
I REALLY NEED YOU.

40:39.828 --> 40:42.962
YOU SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT
OF THAT BEFORE YOU
RATTED ME OUT.

40:43.005 --> 40:47.009
♪ DID YOU EVER
REALLY LOVE ME? ♪

40:47.053 --> 40:49.316

THIS IS WHERE
I SAY THANK YOU.

41:19.607 --> 41:21.566
-FOR WHAT?
-YOUR ADVICE.

41:21.609 --> 41:23.481
THE LESS I KNEW,
THE BETTER.

41:23.524 --> 41:25.308
OCEAN'S DEAD.

41:25.352 --> 41:27.572
I'LL NEED TO SEE
HIS BODY.

41:27.615 --> 41:30.488
AND I'LL BRING IT,
AND YOU'LL GIVE ME KATE.

41:30.531 --> 41:32.446
NOW SEND YOUR LITTLE
ERRAND GIRL TO COME FETCH.

41:37.930 --> 41:40.498

LUNATIC THAN I THOUGHT.

41:43.588 --> 41:44.980
THANK YOU.

42:14.923 --> 42:16.882
GREG, MOVE YOUR HEAD!
