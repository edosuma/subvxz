-Sir, I can't.

01:00.143 --> 01:01.599
I have something this time.

01:01.812 --> 01:04.599
Let me guess. More random,
unsourced atmospherics...

01:04.815 --> 01:08.148
...about a covert spy program
pulling jobs all over the world?

01:08.318 --> 01:10.980
-Not atmospherics, sir.
-Tweets?

01:11.154 --> 01:12.564
Proof, sir.

It was in my mailbox this morning.

Detailed after-action reports

01:17.828 --> 01:20.570
...have come from inside the Division.

That's what I've heard it's called.

01:23.834 --> 01:27.622
After-action reports, huh?
What was the action?

01:27.838 --> 01:31.501
Assassinations. Sanctioned by
Senator Madeline Pierce.

01:32.718 --> 01:35.050
The late senator, killed in a car bomb.

01:35.220 --> 01:38.007

02:03.415 --> 02:07.203
[OVER PHONE] An ambitious young analyst just
stumbled past her security clearance.

02:07.377 --> 02:10.244
She's gonna be asking questions
none of us want answered.

02:10.422 --> 02:13.664

02:15.177 --> 02:18.419
-lt's the path to destruction.
-Come on, Birkhoff.

02:18.597 --> 02:21.134
It's four missions the president
wants us to look into.

02:21.308 --> 02:23.139
Yeah, then it's five, then six.

02:23.310 --> 02:24.766

this down, earning their freedom...

02:28.732 --> 02:31.519
...they have to shine it on
a little longer for Uncle Sam.

at the CIA.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.612

in her mailbox this morning.

04:42.783 --> 04:44.398

04:44.576 --> 04:48.034

only come from the black box.

-Amanda.
-Naomi said she thought she saw...

04:50.415 --> 04:53.122
...someone watching her,
but it was a man, not a woman.

04:53.293 --> 04:56.626
All right, what exactly
is on this flash drive?

04:56.797 --> 04:58.788
Ten digital files, un-redacted.

04:58.965 --> 05:01.217
Linking former senator Madeline Pierce...

05:01.384 --> 05:04.046
...to a secret black ops unit called Division.

05:05.222 --> 05:07.964
Why would Amanda leak this?
If she wanted to expose us...

05:08.141 --> 05:10.928
...she could send the black box
to The New York Times.

05:11.102 --> 05:14.060
Why peel off a couple of files
and filter it through the CIA?

05:14.231 --> 05:17.018

Why are we not looking at them now?

05:17.192 --> 05:19.683

We gotta figure out pick up.

05:19.861 --> 05:21.362
You guys never heard of e-mail?

05:21.571 --> 05:24.313

05:25.951 --> 05:28.112

to pick it up.

05:28.286 --> 05:30.197
We can'tjust waltz into the CIA.

05:30.372 --> 05:32.954
It would have to be done discreetly and--

05:34.543 --> 05:35.578

05:36.586 --> 05:38.838
That's her move.
She's going after Kendrick.

05:39.005 --> 05:40.961
-Kendrick?
-The only person at the CIA...

05:41.132 --> 05:43.714
...who knows about Division.
He's keeping the secret.

05:43.885 --> 05:47.503
He wouldn'tjust send some random agent
out to deliver it.

05:47.681 --> 05:48.921
It would have to be him.

05:49.099 --> 05:52.341

of the CIA? That's a little crazy.

05:52.519 --> 05:55.852
Amanda targeting our closest ally
in the government is not so crazy.

14:56.479 --> 15:01.348
No. Not really. He was like a blend of
all my brother's old roommates.

15:01.526 --> 15:04.484
-Kind of faceless.
-But if you saw him again, you'd know.

15:04.654 --> 15:07.316
Yeah, I'm pretty sure. Why?

15:08.908 --> 15:12.947
Let me try out one of my crazy theories,
okay? I'll get back to you.

15:13.162 --> 15:15.027
Thank you for your time.

15:15.665 --> 15:17.781
Nice gun, by the way.

15:18.709 --> 15:22.122
Thanks. I think.

15:22.296 --> 15:25.629
No. Pierce never had a tracker,
he was never an official--

15:25.800 --> 15:28.041
We are extending every resource, sir.

15:28.219 --> 15:30.926
The second we find him, we'll bring him in.

15:32.306 --> 15:34.262
Danforth, calling from the White House.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.425
Could have said you think I didn't do it.

15:36.602 --> 15:39.765
-He's just worried about Division.
-What?

15:39.939 --> 15:42.180
This investigation is raising questions...

15:42.358 --> 15:45.020
...concerning your whereabouts
during your leave.

15:45.194 --> 15:47.651
I was all over the world
on missions with you guys.

15:47.822 --> 15:50.609
Exactly. That's what Amanda wanted
to begin with.

15:50.783 --> 15:52.899
Expose Division, and watch us squirm.

15:53.077 --> 15:56.365
If Division gets exposed,
she gets to watch us die or go to prison.

15:56.539 --> 15:59.952
We don't have a counterattack ready,
but we need to make a move now.

16:02.545 --> 16:04.376
You're right.

16:05.256 --> 16:06.712
You have to turn yourself in.

16:07.842 --> 16:10.254
-What?
-Just as a stop-gap measure.

16:10.428 --> 16:13.886
To buy time, while we find
Amanda's accomplice and clear your name.

16:14.056 --> 16:15.557
So he has to say he's guilty?

16:15.725 --> 16:17.932
No, he turns himself over
for questioning...

16:18.102 --> 16:19.933
...just as any innocent man would do.

16:23.357 --> 16:27.475
-What if they try to pin it on him?
-Without motive? Won't work.

16:28.279 --> 16:30.315
We can't do this. Sean isn't like us.

16:30.490 --> 16:32.230
He has a record, a reputation...

16:32.408 --> 16:34.774
...a career he has spent
his entire life building.

16:34.952 --> 16:37.113
Not if I stay in the shadows.

16:39.457 --> 16:41.413
I'm on every news channel, Alex.

16:41.584 --> 16:46.248
They've raided my apartment, they're
questioning my sisters, my teammates.

16:46.422 --> 16:48.538
My reputation's already tarnished.

16:53.971 --> 16:56.223
The longer I stay hidden,
the guiltier I look.

16:56.390 --> 16:59.257
-You're going through with this?
SEAN: I'm innocent, remember?

16:59.435 --> 17:03.974
I got a whole secret agency
trying to prove that.

17:06.275 --> 17:09.438
I believe if I take the heat off them,
they'll return the favor?

17:09.612 --> 17:10.692
We Will.

17:16.494 --> 17:18.359
Sean.

17:22.458 --> 17:25.120
WOMAN [ON TV]: Sources speaking
under the condition of anonymity...

17:25.294 --> 17:27.956
...have named a person of interest
in the public bombing:

17:28.130 --> 17:29.791
Lieutenant Commander Sean Pierce.

17:32.718 --> 17:34.504
I'm the guy you're looking for.

17:35.805 --> 17:37.966
Freeze! Get down on the ground!

17:44.689 --> 17:47.647
Reports from witnesses
in the federal building...

17:47.817 --> 17:51.526
...indicate that Sean Pierce
willingly surrendered himself.

17:51.696 --> 17:54.403
How could you do this?
This is exactly what Amanda wants.

17:54.574 --> 17:56.781
-We didn't have a choice.
-Of course you did.

17:56.951 --> 17:58.236
They have no motive.

17:59.078 --> 18:01.364
Amanda's planning something.
Trust me.

18:01.539 --> 18:04.656
We're not sitting on our hands.
We're building the cover story...

18:04.834 --> 18:06.665
...to frame Amanda's accomplice.

18:06.836 --> 18:10.454
We 're building a cover story that paints
the accomplice as a lone nutjob...

18:10.631 --> 18:13.964
...obsessed with Madeline Pierce
conspiracies. Once we ﬁnd him...

18:14.135 --> 18:15.966
...we plant it in his residence.

18:16.137 --> 18:19.925
It'll explain why he went to great lengths
to frame the senator's son.

18:28.858 --> 18:31.019
Bam! That's what I'm talking about.

18:31.193 --> 18:32.899
Not exactly retina display...

18:33.070 --> 18:36.107
...but I got a long-lens shot
from a liquor store.

18:36.282 --> 18:38.364
Looks like he tossed his phone.

18:38.534 --> 18:41.367
-Somebody screwed the pooch.
-Without gloves on.

18:41.871 --> 18:44.203
Get a team down there.
See if we can lift prints.

18:44.373 --> 18:48.742
Fastest way to convince the Feds they got
the wrong guy? Give them the right one.

18:53.049 --> 18:56.633
Mr. Pierce, you wanted to talk to us.

18:57.219 --> 18:59.210
That's why I came in.

19:00.431 --> 19:02.717
So far, you haven't said anything.

19:02.892 --> 19:05.884
-Sir, I've answered all your questions.
-Not really.

19:07.313 --> 19:10.521
You haven't explained
why you left the SEALs.

19:10.691 --> 19:12.727
Or where you spend your days.

19:13.944 --> 19:17.562
Or where you were the afternoon
Director Kendrick was murdered.

19:18.908 --> 19:21.115
I told you I was at my apartment,
taking a nap.

19:21.285 --> 19:25.904
-Can anyone substantiate that?
-Not really. Can anyone refute it?

19:27.958 --> 19:30.415
Fresh from the trash.

19:33.297 --> 19:34.912
Let's see what we got here.

19:41.472 --> 19:42.803
Ellis Toyon.

19:42.973 --> 19:47.717
Convicted of grand theft auto,
just out on parole.

19:47.937 --> 19:49.802
Not exactly top-rung talent.

19:49.980 --> 19:51.766
That's not like Amanda.

19:51.941 --> 19:54.102
Take your breaks where you get them.

19:54.276 --> 19:56.062

[PHONE RINGS]

19:58.155 --> 20:00.237
-Ceaver.
NIKITA: Naomi, Special Agent Bishop.

20:00.449 --> 20:03.031
I'm sending a photo to your phone.

20:06.163 --> 20:07.619
-That's him.
NIKITA: You're sure?

20:07.790 --> 20:10.748
I'm sure. I remember those eyes.
Who is he?

20:10.960 --> 20:13.292
You'll know when I know.
Thank you for picking up.

20:13.462 --> 20:15.953
Wait. How do I get in touch with you?

20:16.132 --> 20:17.463
I'll get in touch with you.

20:17.633 --> 20:21.171
Because I called the Bureau, and
they transferred me to your voicemail.

20:21.345 --> 20:25.463
But when I contacted a supervisor
at Hoover, he didn't have you on file.

20:25.641 --> 20:29.008
I'm not working out of the DC. office.
I'm liaising from Quantico.

20:29.854 --> 20:32.687
Got it. Which division?

20:34.316 --> 20:35.476
What are you getting at?

20:35.651 --> 20:39.690
It's just that,
that black ops group you mentioned.

20:39.864 --> 20:43.482
One of my theories is that they operate
by impersonating other agencies...

20:43.659 --> 20:47.322
...moving invisibly through the bureaucracy
in order to cover their tracks.

20:47.496 --> 20:49.327
A process known as black-badging.

20:49.540 --> 20:52.782
I'm familiar with the concept,
but can you imagine the amount of...

20:53.002 --> 20:56.586
...Iogistical support it would take
to maintain that level of deception?

20:56.756 --> 20:59.463
Would have to have an entire floor
of computer experts...

20:59.633 --> 21:01.089
...working around the clock.

21:01.802 --> 21:03.542
Right, not very likely.

21:04.889 --> 21:08.131
Naomi, our focus should be on getting
the real bad guys.

21:08.309 --> 21:10.391
You're right. I agree.

21:18.110 --> 21:19.975
Girl is pushing it.

21:20.154 --> 21:23.362
Our good friend Ellis
may not have a reliable address...

21:23.532 --> 21:25.739
...but he does have a new credit card...

21:25.910 --> 21:28.572
...with a charge for Chinese takeout
one hour ago.

21:28.746 --> 21:32.364
-Got the delivery address.
-Let's see if he wants dessert.

21:39.590 --> 21:41.126
I know that smell.

21:41.926 --> 21:45.794
-Amanda.
-Yeah, she cleaned him.

[PHONE RINGING]

22:03.697 --> 22:05.312
AMANDA [OVER PHONE]:
One question, Nikita.

22:05.825 --> 22:09.989
Do you really think I'd have my operative
drop his phone in the trash for you to ﬁnd?

22:10.162 --> 22:12.824
-This is what we're calling an operative?
-Wel|.

22:12.998 --> 22:15.535
When you don't have the best,
take what's available.

22:15.709 --> 22:16.835
I taught you that.

22:17.002 --> 22:20.711
What are you trying to teach us now?
That every operative is disposable?

22:21.257 --> 22:24.420
Alex, how nice to hear your voice.

22:25.427 --> 22:29.011
I think you’re beginning to see
that running Division is difﬁcult work.

22:29.181 --> 22:32.673
Work that requires hard choices,
hard sacrifice.

22:32.852 --> 22:35.935
First Michael's hand, now Sean's life.

22:36.856 --> 22:38.892
Sean is a decorated soldier.
He's innocent.

22:39.108 --> 22:40.894
Without motive, they can't charge him.

22:41.110 --> 22:45.023
Very good. So the problem is
how we establish motive.

22:50.661 --> 22:55.701
AMANDA: Turns out Sean was ordered to see
a Navy psychiatrist after his mother’s death.

22:55.875 --> 23:00.619
The loss, combined with latent PTSD,
caused increasing levels of paranoia.

23:00.796 --> 23:02.252
The doctor was meticulous.

23:02.423 --> 23:05.210
He took copious notes
on his digital recorder.

23:07.052 --> 23:11.341
The notes proved Sean believed his
mother was assassinated by the CIA...

23:11.515 --> 23:14.222
...in retaliation for reducing their funding.

23:14.685 --> 23:17.643
So he plotted his revenge.

23:17.813 --> 23:20.850
A car bomb for the director of the CIA.

23:21.025 --> 23:25.064
The same way they killed his mother.
Poetic justice.

23:26.363 --> 23:28.228
So, Nikita...

23:29.533 --> 23:33.025
...you did the right thing
by throwing Sean to the FBI.

23:33.579 --> 23:37.538
These are the sacriﬁces we make
to protect Division. And, yes, Alex...

23:38.584 --> 23:42.873
...the lesson
is that every operative is disposable.

23:44.840 --> 23:47.206
Sean Pierce,
you have the right to remain silent.

23:47.384 --> 23:50.672
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

23:50.846 --> 23:53.838
You have the right to an attorney.
If you cannot afford one...

23:54.016 --> 23:56.883
...one will be appointed for you
by the state.

23:57.311 --> 24:00.178
Patient identiﬁes two previous episodes
of paranoia...

24:00.356 --> 24:03.268
...the initial incident
following the murder of his mother.

24:03.484 --> 24:06.601
Voice-stress-analyzer registers
well above normal.

24:06.779 --> 24:08.895
Amanda was holding a gun to his head.

24:09.323 --> 24:11.814
Gun that killed the doctor
was a SOCOM .45.

24:11.992 --> 24:14.369
Weapon of choice for Navy SEALs.

24:18.999 --> 24:22.207
-There's gotta be a way we can scrub this.
-Too late for that.

24:23.420 --> 24:25.832
-What can they charge him with?
-Treason...

24:26.006 --> 24:27.542
...domestic terrorism....

24:28.300 --> 24:31.212
You're talking death penalty.
There's nothing we can do?

24:33.138 --> 24:34.514
[SIGHS]

24:34.932 --> 24:36.047
There is.

24:39.603 --> 24:41.468
We can do what we do best.

24:41.647 --> 24:45.310
Take Sean from the law,
we bring him to Division.

24:45.484 --> 24:47.270
The way I was brought in.

24:50.030 --> 24:52.737
First we gotta kill him.

24:57.871 --> 25:04.117
Okay. We have a two-fold problem.
Fake Sean's death, and extract him. Ideas?

25:04.294 --> 25:07.878
Faking a suicide won't work. Can't
hang himself in an interrogation room.

25:08.048 --> 25:10.755
Slipping him poison
will raise too many questions.

25:10.926 --> 25:13.963
What about a
don't-Iook-don't—touch gag?

25:14.388 --> 25:16.970
I hacked their forensic Iab's inventory.

25:17.141 --> 25:21.100
Russian informant who died of Polonium
poisoning currently on ice in the basement.

25:21.270 --> 25:23.682
Scheduled to be picked up
by the CDC next week.

25:23.856 --> 25:26.347
No one wants to be near radiation.
Don't look.

25:26.525 --> 25:30.518
Don't touch. That solves extraction.
Now for the other problem.

25:30.696 --> 25:33.688
There's a third problem. Sean.

25:35.576 --> 25:37.316
There's no turning back.

25:37.494 --> 25:40.486
We're making a decision
without knowing it's what he wants.

25:41.165 --> 25:44.077
Briefing him in the middle
of the FBI beehive is difficult.

25:44.918 --> 25:48.206
-Tenth floor's too hot to use a cover.
-This ain't like Hong Kong...

25:48.380 --> 25:51.087
...when you were in holding
and Sean played your lawyer.

25:51.592 --> 25:53.128
What if we use a real lawyer?

25:55.888 --> 25:59.096
Alex, can you get in touch
with Sean's sisters?

26:17.034 --> 26:21.243
-Excuse me! So sorry.
-Any time.

26:26.835 --> 26:28.951

26:32.007 --> 26:33.372
Take them off.

26:33.550 --> 26:37.384
I'm sure you don't want to be accused

Glad you noticed.

27:03.622 --> 27:05.283
From your sisters.

27:05.457 --> 27:09.871

-He's reading, we're holding our breath.

27:41.743 --> 27:43.119

27:51.920 --> 27:53.535
What's Article 134?

27:53.714 --> 27:57.957
Military violation.
Self-injury with intent to avoid service.

27:58.135 --> 28:01.377
-Not sure I'd get that.
-That's because you were never a SEAL.

28:01.555 --> 28:04.888
Come on, man. The address is even wrong.
It's a dead giveaway.

28:15.777 --> 28:17.233
I think I understand.

28:17.446 --> 28:19.937
Good, because I couldn't
make much sense of it.

28:20.490 --> 28:22.981
They need to know if you agree.

28:31.460 --> 28:33.371

28:38.592 --> 28:41.834
Could you point me in the direction of

28:42.012 --> 28:44.344
Bullpen. Near holding.

28:48.560 --> 28:50.721
Is this a difficult decision?

28:52.481 --> 28:53.971
Yeah.

29:24.471 --> 29:25.506
-Wi|| Arnold.
-Yeah?

29:25.681 --> 29:28.673
Naomi Ceaver, CIA.
I need clearance to speak with Sean Pierce.

29:28.850 --> 29:31.011
You're gonna need
higher clearance than that.

29:31.186 --> 29:33.848
All due respect, sir.
Something much bigger is going on.

29:34.022 --> 29:36.479
-Excuse me?
-Pierce is just the tip of the iceberg.

29:36.650 --> 29:38.231
And he is not acting alone.

29:38.443 --> 29:42.027
I have reason to believe there are
other conspirators out there.

29:45.534 --> 29:46.740
What's she doing here?

29:46.910 --> 29:48.901
Earning her Fletcher badge.
How's the kit?

29:49.079 --> 29:51.695
Ready. It's up to Sean now.

29:52.124 --> 29:56.663
Sean. If you don't give me an answer,
I'll have no choice but to leave.
