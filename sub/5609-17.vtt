00:01.168 --> 00:03.159
NARRATOR: Previously on
Once Upon A Time...

00:03.253 --> 00:06.495
Hades told me to pick three names
and chisel them onto the headstones.

00:06.590 --> 00:09.127
He said whoever I picked
would remain in the UndenNorId.

00:09.218 --> 00:10.674
HADES: Get me Zelena's baby.

00:10.761 --> 00:14.299
I will rip up the contract
and you can tell Belle she's pregnant

00:14.389 --> 00:18.883
without also having to tell her
she owes her baby to me.

00:18.977 --> 00:21.468
My price is her.

00:21.563 --> 00:23.224
The young lady is engaged to me.

00:23.315 --> 00:27.524
I am Sir Gaston.
You, Beast, have taken my love.

00:39.706 --> 00:42.322
Father! Father, are you in here?

00:42.417 --> 00:43.953
I'm right here, Belle.

00:44.545 --> 00:47.252
We're supposed to go riding today.
Why aren't you dressed for it?

00:47.339 --> 00:51.457
Plans have changed.
We have a visitor in the castle today.

00:51.552 --> 00:53.258
The eldest son of Lord LeGume.

00:53.345 --> 00:55.882
Father, no.
I do not want to meet any more suitors.

00:55.973 --> 00:57.804
Especially not that cretin.

00:57.891 --> 00:58.880
So you know him?

00:58.976 --> 01:00.637
Well, I know of him.

01:00.727 --> 01:03.764
He's supposedly the vainest man
in all the land.

01:03.855 --> 01:07.768
Fancies himself quite the hunter
both of animals and women.

01:07.859 --> 01:09.360
At least give him a chance.

01:09.444 --> 01:11.856
Don'tjudge someone
until you know their whole story.

01:11.947 --> 01:13.608
I know enough.

01:13.699 --> 01:17.362
Belle, wait. There is more at stake.

01:18.453 --> 01:21.991
On our northern borders, there
have been skirmishes with the ogres.

01:22.082 --> 01:24.448
Good men have died.

01:24.543 --> 01:25.828
That's horrible.

01:25.919 --> 01:29.832
But Lord LeGume has a powerful army.
If you were to marry his son...

01:29.923 --> 01:31.584
What, marry him? Are you mad?

01:31.675 --> 01:34.212
(CHUCKLES) What does Mother
have to say about this?

01:34.303 --> 01:35.463
She agrees with me.

01:36.138 --> 01:39.255
I'm not arranging a wedding, Belle.
I simply want you to meet him.

01:39.349 --> 01:40.384
GASTON: Am I too early?

01:43.395 --> 01:44.851
You're right on time. Come in.

01:46.023 --> 01:47.479
Meet my daughter.

01:48.150 --> 01:50.232
Belle, this is Gaston.

01:52.529 --> 01:53.735
lt's lovely to meet you, Belle.

01:54.906 --> 01:57.363
Gaston, I've heard so much about you.

02:03.915 --> 02:06.998
I'm sorry.
This is terribly awkward, isn't it?

02:07.085 --> 02:09.462
Do you hate these setups
as much as I do?

02:10.130 --> 02:12.587
Well, since you're asking, yes.

02:12.674 --> 02:15.131
I've heard you're a charming
and intelligent young woman.

02:15.218 --> 02:17.630
And you certainly live up to your name.

02:17.721 --> 02:18.710
But...

02:18.764 --> 02:21.255
You've heard of me,
and you're not interested in this.

02:21.350 --> 02:23.557
Which is fine, I understand.

02:23.644 --> 02:27.011
If it is your wish, I shall turn around
and head home.

02:27.105 --> 02:28.265
No hard feelings.

02:36.907 --> 02:41.742
Actually, uh, one walk couldn't
hurt anyone.

03:01.640 --> 03:02.720
Belle?

03:03.392 --> 03:08.182
No, I won't be separated from this child.
I need your help.

03:08.772 --> 03:11.684
So you accept who I am.

03:11.775 --> 03:15.939
l have accepted that no one will fight
for a child like its father.

03:16.029 --> 03:17.735
You've proven that much.

03:17.823 --> 03:20.314
But no dark magic.

03:20.409 --> 03:22.821
You must've known what you were
letting yourself in for.

03:22.911 --> 03:25.994
When we were in Camelot,
Merlin said that perhaps one day,

03:26.081 --> 03:30.290
someone would be able to wield the
power of the Dark One dagger for good.

03:30.919 --> 03:33.285
Show me that you can be that man.

03:33.380 --> 03:38.170
Show me, and we can save our child.
And we can turn the darkness into light.

03:38.260 --> 03:41.218
Well, that's the thing
with dark and light.

03:41.304 --> 03:42.840
Depends on your point of view.

03:42.931 --> 03:46.014
In the end, you do what you can
to protect those you love.

03:46.101 --> 03:49.685
Well, I'd never resort to darkness
because that's not what a hero does.

03:49.771 --> 03:52.012
In the heat of the moment,
you do whatever it takes.

03:52.107 --> 03:53.972
You want a future with me,

03:55.861 --> 03:57.943
you have to do this my way.

04:12.252 --> 04:16.370
Hades thinks he can beat us.
It's time to prove him wrong.

04:16.465 --> 04:18.296
When I burn these names
from the graves,

04:18.383 --> 04:20.419
there will be nothing keeping us here.

04:21.052 --> 04:22.337
We can all go back home.

04:22.512 --> 04:24.764
-(W|ND HOWLING)
-Wait. Something's wrong.

04:24.848 --> 04:26.213
What is it?

04:26.308 --> 04:28.264
Any captain worth his salt
knows when a storm's brewing.

04:28.351 --> 04:31.218
And trust me,
we need to find shelter now.

04:31.313 --> 04:32.519
Go! Go!

04:32.647 --> 04:34.148
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

04:44.785 --> 04:46.992
That was quick. Everyone okay?

04:47.078 --> 04:50.866
Yeah, but something's out there.

04:54.503 --> 04:55.663
Something was in that storm.

04:58.381 --> 04:59.962
Mom!

05:00.217 --> 05:01.206
(GASPS)

05:02.844 --> 05:04.220
Bad dream?

05:05.889 --> 05:08.005
Yeah. It was nothing.

05:09.059 --> 05:10.390
Sorry I fell asleep.

05:11.019 --> 05:12.350
I'm glad you did.

05:12.437 --> 05:13.973
EMMA: It's not the best way
to keep watch.

05:14.064 --> 05:15.429
KlLLlAN: I've got it under control.

05:15.524 --> 05:18.231
Do you realize this is the first time
you've slept since you rescued me?

05:18.318 --> 05:21.606
I will sleep for weeks as soon as
we defeat Hades. I promise.

05:28.495 --> 05:31.282
That's the signal. They're ready.

05:39.089 --> 05:40.625
-Mom...
-MARY: Oh!

05:40.715 --> 05:41.841
Is everything okay?

05:41.925 --> 05:44.632
Yeah. It's just good to see you.

05:44.719 --> 05:48.632
When you're done hugging it out,
Emma, I can use a little help here.

05:48.723 --> 05:50.975
So this is what you've been working on
all night?

05:51.059 --> 05:54.222
This is our new plan to defeat Hades
and go home?

05:54.312 --> 05:56.724
A bunch of squiggly lines?

05:56.815 --> 05:59.227
REGINA: Hades put one hell of
a protection spell on his elevator,

05:59.317 --> 06:02.730
and these "squiggly lines"
are the only way to crack it open.

06:02.821 --> 06:05.654
Then hopefully, that elevator
will take us straight to him.

06:05.740 --> 06:08.527
Maybe with surprise on our side,
we can get a shot at him.

06:08.618 --> 06:09.903
That's a lot of
"maybes" and "hopefullys."

06:09.995 --> 06:12.202
That's all we have right now.

06:12.289 --> 06:13.904
Okay, let's do this.

06:17.794 --> 06:19.830
(GEARS CLINKING)

06:28.680 --> 06:30.011
(SIGHS) So much for surprising him.

06:30.098 --> 06:33.386
Well, we'll think of something else.
We always do.

06:33.476 --> 06:34.556
What if...

06:35.562 --> 06:38.349
What if I can burn our names off the
gravestones that Hades made for us?

06:38.440 --> 06:39.646
The ones holding us here?

06:39.733 --> 06:42.190
I looked for a spell like that.
Doesn't exist.

06:42.277 --> 06:45.861
Actually, it does.
It kind of came to me in a dream.

06:45.947 --> 06:47.107
In a dream?

06:47.198 --> 06:49.780
I know it sounds crazy,
but I can remember every detail.

06:49.868 --> 06:51.483
It would be a long shot, but...

06:51.578 --> 06:56.242
Well, as for maybes and hopefullys,
I've learned never to question yours.

06:56.333 --> 06:57.322
I'm coming with you.

06:57.918 --> 07:00.034
Snow and I will take Henry
back to the apartment. Keep him safe.

07:00.128 --> 07:01.629
No, actually I'm gonna go with Emma.

07:01.713 --> 07:03.544
No! No, that's not a good idea.

07:03.632 --> 07:06.374
I promised to take down Hades,
and get back to our son, remember?

07:06.885 --> 07:08.170
If this is how we do it, I'm in.

07:08.261 --> 07:11.219
Emma, Iwouldn't argue
with your mother. Trust me.

07:11.806 --> 07:14.388
Get going, and
I'll meet you at the cemetery.

07:14.476 --> 07:16.717
First, I should talk to my sister.

07:16.811 --> 07:20.429
Apparently, she has some history
with Hades.

07:20.523 --> 07:21.512
EMMA: You think she'll talk to you?

07:21.608 --> 07:25.271
I don't know,
but if he does have a weakness,

07:25.362 --> 07:27.273
she might be the only person
who knows what it is.

08:19.958 --> 08:22.040
(DOGS BARKING)

08:24.421 --> 08:26.707
HADES: Now, this is just depressing.

08:28.550 --> 08:31.041
Look where Gaston the great hunter
ended up.

08:31.136 --> 08:32.797
And all because of a woman.

08:32.887 --> 08:34.593
Not that I'm one to judge. Believe me.

08:34.681 --> 08:37.423
I've had my own share
of girl trouble lately.

08:38.059 --> 08:40.971
Lord Hades, why are you here?

08:41.062 --> 08:45.396
There are some visitors in town
I think you might be interested in.

08:45.483 --> 08:47.860
That beauty you were once engaged to,

08:47.944 --> 08:51.937
and the beast who stole her,
and then murdered you.

08:52.032 --> 08:53.067
Rumplestiltskin.

08:55.160 --> 08:57.947
So the Dark One is finally dead.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.244
Mmm, not quite yet.

08:59.330 --> 09:04.495
But how would you like to finally
get your shot at revenge?

09:05.837 --> 09:07.793
Why are you coming to me?
What's in it for you?

09:07.881 --> 09:12.966
(SIGHS) Things have changed
in my little domain lately.

09:13.053 --> 09:16.591
Do you know what I've been finding
growing all over town?

09:18.016 --> 09:19.096
That's impossible.

09:19.184 --> 09:20.390
It should be.

09:20.477 --> 09:24.891
Because nothing grows here.
Things only decay.

09:24.981 --> 09:26.972
I don't understand. What's changed?

09:27.776 --> 09:29.186
Hope. (CHUCKLES)

09:29.986 --> 09:31.817
Thanks to these new arrivals,

09:33.031 --> 09:35.647
hope has taken root.

09:35.742 --> 09:39.576
And when souls have hope,
they move on.

09:39.662 --> 09:42.574
And I cannot have that.

09:44.667 --> 09:46.123
Of course not, Lord Hades.

09:48.713 --> 09:50.419
These interlopers must be punished.

09:50.507 --> 09:53.294
Starting with the man
who murdered you

09:53.384 --> 09:56.467
and dared to go back on a deal with me.

09:56.554 --> 09:58.715
But how am I supposed to defeat
the Dark One?

10:01.184 --> 10:04.176
Check out the arrows.
I think you'll find them up to the task.

10:05.146 --> 10:08.604
This is your chance to be
a great hunter once again.

10:08.691 --> 10:12.934
And this time your prey will be
the greatest beast of them all.

10:14.405 --> 10:15.440
Rumplestiltskin.

10:21.955 --> 10:24.822
GASTON: I have to say, I am impressed
how far you've hiked.

10:25.083 --> 10:28.041
I suppose your perseverance
is matched only by your beauty.

10:28.670 --> 10:29.750
Really?

10:30.338 --> 10:32.624
(CHUCKLES) Does that line work on
all your first dates?

10:32.715 --> 10:34.296
Have we moved from
a "meeting" to a "date"?

10:34.384 --> 10:36.966
-You know what I meant.
-(CHUCKLES)

10:37.053 --> 10:40.887
I bet you think I'm the same Gaston
as all the stories you've heard about.

10:40.974 --> 10:44.182
I must say,
I have heard some unflattering tales.

10:44.727 --> 10:46.763
Well, then I profoundly apologize.

10:47.605 --> 10:52.065
I have this friend, LeFou. He loves to
spread tall tales and to embarrass me.

10:52.235 --> 10:58.196
Ah, so you're not this great hunter
of women I've heard so much about?

10:58.283 --> 11:00.274
I hunt only wild game, I assure you.

11:03.746 --> 11:06.328
My love life has been tragically empty.

11:07.167 --> 11:10.910
Actually, I've spent my whole life
looking for a woman of real substance.

11:13.381 --> 11:14.416
Wait.

11:15.175 --> 11:16.540
What is it?

11:20.763 --> 11:22.094
Wild creature.

11:22.182 --> 11:25.265
Very large. Very close.

11:26.561 --> 11:28.142
Stay here.

11:32.108 --> 11:33.188
Gaston?

11:35.695 --> 11:36.730
Gaston?

11:41.618 --> 11:42.778
Gaston!

11:48.082 --> 11:49.743
Gaston?

11:51.044 --> 11:52.705
Well, I'm afraid
this won't be much of a hunt.

11:52.795 --> 11:55.923
Whatever that was,
it fell into this old hunting pit.

11:58.134 --> 11:59.214
Impossible.

11:59.302 --> 12:01.463
What is it?

12:01.554 --> 12:03.215
The war is closer than we thought.

12:04.224 --> 12:05.259
It's an ogre.

12:05.475 --> 12:06.464
(GASPS)

12:06.726 --> 12:10.093
No! There's never been an ogre
anywhere near the castle before.

12:14.901 --> 12:16.266
Look at him. He...

12:16.319 --> 12:18.776
He's barely full grown. He's just a child.

12:19.572 --> 12:21.312
Maybe he wandered too far from home.

12:21.449 --> 12:23.314
Or maybe they're using their young
as scouts,

12:23.451 --> 12:25.942
and their entire army
is following behind.

12:25.995 --> 12:28.327
We have to haul him up
and take him back to your father.

12:28.456 --> 12:29.491
No, we can't.

12:29.624 --> 12:33.742
We bring this creature back to
the castle, the soldiers will torture him.

12:33.836 --> 12:35.292
We have to find another way.

12:35.338 --> 12:38.000
This isn't our decision.
The whole kingdom could be at risk.

12:38.841 --> 12:42.629
I know. And I realize
you've only known me an hour.

12:42.679 --> 12:45.011
But if you trust me,

12:45.098 --> 12:48.636
I promise I can find out
what this ogre is after

12:48.685 --> 12:50.141
without hurting him.

12:52.313 --> 12:53.302
(SIGHS)

12:54.691 --> 12:55.680
(CHUCKLES)

12:57.360 --> 12:59.021
Lead the way.

13:11.291 --> 13:12.952
-Useless.
-Well, keep looking.

13:13.293 --> 13:15.705
(EXHALES) These books are full of
light magic.

13:15.837 --> 13:17.498
There must be something in here
that can help.

13:17.547 --> 13:19.458
If we wanted to boil a pot of tea, yes.

13:19.549 --> 13:23.041
So every time you try something
nefarious, it's a smashing success,

13:23.136 --> 13:26.344
but when I ask you to channel
that power for good, you fail?

13:26.389 --> 13:28.175
I don't care what Merlin said.

13:28.224 --> 13:31.307
To be able to turn darkness to light
is a fool's errand.

13:31.394 --> 13:34.386
To use darkness for light,
that may be possible.

13:34.522 --> 13:35.511
I won't allow it.

13:35.565 --> 13:36.680
Then we will fail.

13:36.733 --> 13:39.475
Great. Well, this was a mistake.
I shouldn't have come here.

13:41.738 --> 13:42.727
GOLD: Belle.

13:45.491 --> 13:46.901
Belle, please, come back.

13:47.577 --> 13:49.363
I don't want to hear any more...

13:49.412 --> 13:50.902
(ARROW WHISTLES, THUDS)

13:54.584 --> 13:57.576
Gaston? What are you doing here?

13:57.712 --> 14:00.203
He killed me.
I'm going to return the favor.

14:00.256 --> 14:03.043
It's gonna take much more than
a pointy stick to kill me.

14:03.092 --> 14:04.923
(SCOFFS) We'll see about that.

14:10.183 --> 14:11.764
Interesting choice of weapon.

14:11.851 --> 14:13.512
So it was Hades that sent you?

14:13.603 --> 14:17.596
He and I want the same thing.
To make sure you stay down here.

14:17.690 --> 14:19.100
BELLE: Stop! Stop!

14:19.192 --> 14:22.275
Gaston, we all have history together,

14:22.403 --> 14:24.689
but there must be some other way
to resolve it.

14:24.781 --> 14:27.022
I have been trapped down here
for years,

14:27.116 --> 14:29.448
suffering and miserable,
because of him.

14:30.119 --> 14:33.611
So, no, I can't let the beast go free.

14:37.377 --> 14:41.791
So, you killed Gaston, my fiance,
and never thought to tell me?

14:41.881 --> 14:44.247
It was an arranged marriage.
I was doing you a favor.

14:44.300 --> 14:45.460
This was a mistake.

14:45.593 --> 14:49.552
Once again, I've let my optimism
cloud myjudgment.

14:51.933 --> 14:53.594
His threat is real, you know.

14:54.477 --> 14:58.766
I may be immortal, but Hades forged
these arrows in the River of Souls.

14:59.273 --> 15:02.640
A river which flows
right into this very sea, in fact.

15:03.152 --> 15:04.232
Now, immortal or not,

15:04.320 --> 15:07.608
one scratch, and I'm trapped
in these waters forever.

15:09.283 --> 15:11.490
And I won't be able to help our child.

15:12.662 --> 15:13.993
Hades is clever.

15:14.122 --> 15:18.161
He sent Gaston because he knows
you won't let me hurt him.

15:18.251 --> 15:20.663
Let's prove him wrong.

15:20.753 --> 15:22.664
Let me use just a little bit
of dark magic,

15:22.713 --> 15:25.170
just enough to take care of Gaston.

15:25.258 --> 15:27.795
No, that's not how we're gonna
defeat him.

15:27.844 --> 15:30.005
We're gonna do the opposite.
We're going to help him.

15:30.763 --> 15:34.927
We're going to see to it that he finally
moves on from this infernal place.

15:35.017 --> 15:36.177
Belle, please. He's not worth it.

15:36.269 --> 15:38.134
It's notjust about him.

15:38.187 --> 15:40.439
Hook said, when his brother moved on,

15:40.523 --> 15:43.640
it affected Hades somehow.

15:43.693 --> 15:44.933
It weakened him.

15:45.027 --> 15:50.112
So by helping people move on,
maybe that's how we defeat Hades.

15:57.498 --> 16:00.865
This spell worked in my dream.
Now Ijust need to make it happen.

16:03.921 --> 16:05.172
(WIND HOWLING)

16:05.465 --> 16:06.796
Emma, wait.

16:07.842 --> 16:10.379
Any captain worth his salt
knows when a storm's brewing.

16:10.470 --> 16:11.710
And trust me, we need to find shelter.

16:11.846 --> 16:13.882
Why did you just say that?

16:14.015 --> 16:16.347
Oh, it's fine, love. It'sjust a storm.
I've survived worse.

16:16.392 --> 16:18.348
No. I should not have brought you here.

16:18.394 --> 16:22.012
My dream, it wasn'tjust a dream.
This is exactly how it happened.

16:22.064 --> 16:24.897
Can we talk about that a bit later?
We need to take shelter now!

16:25.943 --> 16:27.604
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

16:35.870 --> 16:37.906
Well, look at that,
the world's fastest storm.

16:38.039 --> 16:39.904
Maybe this is turning into
a good dream.

16:40.041 --> 16:42.202
It wasn't the storm I was worried about.

16:42.251 --> 16:44.082
In the dream,
the cyclone brought a monster.

16:44.170 --> 16:45.910
What kind of monster?

16:46.088 --> 16:47.874
-(CREATU RE ROARS)
-That kind.

16:48.508 --> 16:49.714
-|'|| take a look.
-No!

16:49.759 --> 16:50.748
Mom...

16:50.843 --> 16:52.253
You just have to trust me,
I can't let you do this.

16:52.345 --> 16:55.929
Okay. Okay. Emma, it was your dream.

16:56.057 --> 16:58.594
You tell us, what do we do now?

16:58.726 --> 16:59.932
(CREATU RE ROARS)

17:00.728 --> 17:01.934
We run.

17:13.407 --> 17:14.533
Want some company?

17:21.874 --> 17:24.081
-How's my daughter?
-Safe.

17:24.627 --> 17:26.583
Hidden in the woods with Robin Hood.

17:26.629 --> 17:29.621
Hades will never find where they are.

17:29.757 --> 17:30.792
He'll find her eventually.

17:31.801 --> 17:33.883
When he wants something,
he never gives up.

17:34.929 --> 17:35.964
And you know this how?

17:36.973 --> 17:38.804
(CLEARS THROAT)
I don't want to talk about it.

17:40.643 --> 17:42.929
Zelena, for once in our lives,

17:42.979 --> 17:47.268
maybe we can just try
acting like sisters.

17:49.819 --> 17:52.151
What happened between
you and Hades?

17:56.492 --> 17:58.323
He fell in love with me.

18:01.247 --> 18:05.115
-Oh.
-I know, it's totally ridiculous.

18:05.167 --> 18:08.455
The idea that anyone could love me.

18:11.507 --> 18:12.496
Do you love him?

18:18.431 --> 18:21.093
I can imagine how hard this is for you,

18:21.183 --> 18:23.265
but you know Hades.

18:23.352 --> 18:25.934
He's the one who's keeping
us all down here.

18:26.022 --> 18:28.104
So I need to know what his weakness is.

18:29.692 --> 18:30.681
(CHUCKLES)

18:32.695 --> 18:34.686
So this little visit wasn't just
sisterly concern.

18:34.780 --> 18:35.769
It was about Hades.

18:35.865 --> 18:37.321
No, it was both.

18:37.366 --> 18:40.233
Well, I'm sorry I don't have
more to offer.

18:40.369 --> 18:44.203
But as far as I know,
I'm his only weakness.

18:53.549 --> 18:57.758
Okay, I know it seems a little creepy,
but we should be safe down here.

18:57.845 --> 18:58.834
(CREATURE ROARS IN DISTANCE)

19:00.681 --> 19:02.057
Are you sure about that?

19:02.099 --> 19:03.930
What the hell is that thing
and why is it chasing us?

19:04.060 --> 19:06.096
I don't know. But if it comes close,
I can get a shot at it.

19:06.228 --> 19:07.434
No, you cannot go back out there.

19:07.563 --> 19:10.100
Emma, what are you so afraid of?
We've faced monsters before.

19:10.232 --> 19:12.689
My dream, it's happening.

19:12.735 --> 19:15.568
And there's something I didn't tell you.

19:17.573 --> 19:18.733
You died.

19:23.245 --> 19:25.952
Belle, you don't need to do this
to find his unfinished business.

19:26.082 --> 19:27.572
I know what it is. Killing me.

19:27.708 --> 19:29.209
What? No, I don't accept that.

19:29.251 --> 19:31.628
You can'tjudge someone
without knowing their full story.

19:33.255 --> 19:34.870
Here. Gaston's locker.

19:37.718 --> 19:39.925
Um, can you, uh,
magic this open for me?

19:40.054 --> 19:42.716
Well, I certainly can.
Are you sure you want me to?

19:42.765 --> 19:44.380
Of course I'm sure. Why wouldn't I be?

19:44.433 --> 19:46.640
Well, using my power to steal
another man's property...

19:46.769 --> 19:48.885
Doesn't that qualify as dark magic?

19:48.938 --> 19:51.395
This isn't murder.
We're opening a locker.

19:51.440 --> 19:55.934
Oh, so you get to be the judge of
when the ends justify the means. I see.

19:56.070 --> 19:58.311
As I said, it's all about points of view.

20:01.909 --> 20:03.149
Thank you.

20:16.799 --> 20:17.834
This...

20:23.097 --> 20:25.964
I'm his unfinished business.

20:30.479 --> 20:33.971
I'll, uh, wait for him. You should go.

20:36.652 --> 20:39.815
Trust me. I can get through to him.

Here. I found it.

GASTON: An Alphabetized Inventory
of Magical Antiquities.

20:59.175 --> 21:00.790
Sounds a bit dense.

21:00.843 --> 21:02.504
No, this is a wonderful book.

21:02.553 --> 21:06.296
It's a record of every magical item
in the kingdom.

21:06.348 --> 21:08.555
And you think one of them will tell us
what this ogre is after?

21:08.684 --> 21:09.673
I'm sure of it.

21:09.810 --> 21:13.723
That's why my mother keeps these
records, for emergencies like this.

21:16.192 --> 21:19.480
Your mother must be quite a woman.

21:19.528 --> 21:23.567
To have raised a daughter
with this much fire in her.

21:25.576 --> 21:29.865
Well, she was the one who taught me
to love books. (CHUCKLES)

I wouldn't have picked you
for a fan of cheap romance.

21:41.592 --> 21:45.676
No. No, this is not like that.

21:45.721 --> 21:50.431
This book is about
compassion and forgiveness.

21:50.559 --> 21:52.720
The things that truly make a hero.

21:54.897 --> 21:58.389
You, uh, can have it if you like.

22:01.779 --> 22:05.863
If this is indeed your favorite book,
I shall read every word. Twice.

22:08.244 --> 22:13.204
Because I have a feeling
I've finally found a woman of substance.

(GASPS)

22:21.298 --> 22:25.712
Wait. Look. This is what we need.

22:27.930 --> 22:29.261
GASTON: "Mirror of Souls."

22:29.390 --> 22:31.881
It says,
"If someone has evil in their soul,

22:31.934 --> 22:33.890
"it will be revealed in the mirror's gaze.

22:33.936 --> 22:36.769
"Their eyes will glow with demonic fire."

22:36.897 --> 22:38.433
So if we see no fire...

22:38.566 --> 22:40.431
Then the ogre means us no harm.

22:40.484 --> 22:42.600
This mirror is about
an hour's ride away.

22:42.736 --> 22:44.067
I can go now.

22:44.113 --> 22:47.605
Good. You go get the mirror,
and I'll watch over the ogre.

22:47.658 --> 22:48.647
But promise me,

22:49.660 --> 22:51.776
in case this creature is not innocent,

22:51.829 --> 22:53.785
you'll bring back your father
and his knights.

in your belly?

to hurt either one of you.

Not interested.

23:59.146 --> 24:02.354

used to say?

"Don'tjudge someone
until you know their whole story."

24:05.736 --> 24:07.067
How did you know that?

24:07.279 --> 24:10.237
(SCOFFS) I know lots of things.
Perk of the job.

24:10.366 --> 24:12.482
Like, you're trying to help
Gaston move on.

24:14.036 --> 24:15.401
And so what if I am?

24:15.913 --> 24:18.905

little conflict

in the world.

24:42.606 --> 24:45.393
I've got your attention now, don't I?

24:46.902 --> 24:48.267
I'm listening.

24:49.238 --> 24:50.444
Smart girl.

24:50.572 --> 24:53.564
Because this is the easiest deal
in the world.

24:53.701 --> 24:57.785
All you have to do is
let Rumplestiltskin face Gaston.

24:57.913 --> 25:02.247
If one of them throws the other
into the River of Souls,

25:02.292 --> 25:04.624
I'll take the mark off your baby.

25:07.089 --> 25:08.078
No.

Why are you all in my vault?

Short version,
a thing with fangs trying to kill us.

26:04.188 --> 26:06.520
And you're hiding instead of fighting?

26:06.648 --> 26:08.604
I saw the same monster in my dream.

26:09.818 --> 26:11.649
And in the end...

26:11.779 --> 26:13.189
It killed me. So...

I thought it was a message
or some sort of vision of the future.

Maybe this dream
isn't just about the monster.

bringing everyone down here?

26:54.696 --> 26:56.402

26:57.991 --> 27:00.573
This was a terrible plan.

27:00.702 --> 27:03.409
I should have done this alone.

27:03.539 --> 27:07.748
Now I'm always frightened.
I'm frightened that someone will die

27:07.876 --> 27:10.253
and it will be my fault.

27:10.379 --> 27:12.540
And I'll never forgive myself.

27:13.215 --> 27:17.174
Emma, you didn't force any of us
down here.

27:17.219 --> 27:19.255
We all wanted to come with you.

27:19.388 --> 27:21.720
We knew it would be hard.
These things always are.

28:15.068 --> 28:17.775
I guess every beast has its weakness.

28:22.034 --> 28:23.023
(EXHALES)

28:23.952 --> 28:27.285
So you would really kill him
if you had the chance.

28:27.956 --> 28:30.447
Yeah, I wasn't sure if you had it in you.

28:32.127 --> 28:33.663
This is pointless, Belle.

28:33.795 --> 28:35.251
Where is Rumplestiltskin?

28:35.297 --> 28:37.253
Gaston, please. Stop this.

28:37.299 --> 28:38.334
I can't! (POUNDS TABLE)

28:39.927 --> 28:42.964
Seeing him dead
is the only thing I care about anymore.

28:43.013 --> 28:44.799
Are you sure about that?

28:48.769 --> 28:51.476
You broke into my locker?

28:51.521 --> 28:54.137
Gaston, I want to help you move on.

28:54.274 --> 28:59.018
If you still have this book,
it must mean something to you.

28:59.154 --> 29:00.360
Of course it does.

29:01.031 --> 29:02.987
Is it because I gave it to you?

29:04.159 --> 29:06.525
Am I your unfinished business?

29:08.121 --> 29:11.705
You think I have this book
because I like it?

29:12.209 --> 29:13.198
(SCOFFS)

29:13.794 --> 29:18.663
I've tried to throw this out
100 times, 1,000...

29:18.799 --> 29:20.835
It always reappears.

29:22.010 --> 29:23.671
It's part of my punishment down here.

29:23.804 --> 29:25.340
I don't understand.

29:25.472 --> 29:29.715
This book reminds me why I died.

29:30.852 --> 29:33.514
Because you made me weak!

29:33.563 --> 29:34.814
What? Me?

29:34.856 --> 29:38.064
I should have gone after
Rumplestiltskin with an army,

29:38.193 --> 29:40.024
but I tried to follow your example.

29:40.070 --> 29:43.403
I tried to do what is right,
but that book is wrong.

29:43.532 --> 29:47.195
Being a hero is not about compassion
and having forgiveness.

29:47.244 --> 29:49.030
It's about strength.

29:49.079 --> 29:51.195
Doing whatever it takes
to defeat your enemies.

29:51.248 --> 29:54.411
But Rumple isn't even your real enemy.
Hades is.

29:54.543 --> 29:56.249
Why do you defend Rumplestiltskin?

29:56.378 --> 29:59.836
He kidnapped you,
he made you a servant.

29:59.881 --> 30:01.587
You should want him dead, too.

30:01.717 --> 30:03.878
-Well, I don't.
-Why not?

30:05.387 --> 30:07.048
He's my husband.

30:11.435 --> 30:12.424
(CHUCKLES)

30:14.938 --> 30:16.223
Good old Belle.

30:19.359 --> 30:22.522
You always did have a soft spot
for a monster.

30:26.742 --> 30:29.108
Gaston is keeping watch on the ogre.

30:29.244 --> 30:32.577
And this mirror will help us learn
the truth of his intentions.

30:32.706 --> 30:35.288
See, Father? The eyes don't lie.

30:36.460 --> 30:38.701
I pray that you're right, Belle.

30:40.297 --> 30:41.377
Gaston?

30:42.424 --> 30:43.880
Gaston!

30:44.134 --> 30:45.590
(GASPS) Are you all right?

30:48.096 --> 30:49.757
Feels like I still have all my limbs.

30:49.806 --> 30:50.795
What happened?

30:50.891 --> 30:54.349
The ogre had escaped when I arrived.
He was waiting in ambush.

30:54.436 --> 30:56.597
Then you're quite lucky to be alive.

30:56.646 --> 30:59.774
I am so sorry. This is all my fault.

30:59.900 --> 31:01.106
It's all right, Belle.

31:02.277 --> 31:05.895
Seeing your concern makes it worth it.

31:05.947 --> 31:10.657
Well, you two have had
an interesting first day.

31:10.786 --> 31:12.617
Head back to the castle.

31:12.746 --> 31:13.781
I'll gather my soldiers.

31:13.914 --> 31:16.326
We'll hunt this ogre down
before it can do any more harm.

31:16.458 --> 31:19.575
No. This ogre tried to kill me,
I should return the favor.

31:20.337 --> 31:22.828
If you would allow,
I'd like to lead the hunting party myself.

31:22.964 --> 31:24.795
You're a brave young man.

31:28.178 --> 31:30.134
Then I'm coming, too.

31:30.180 --> 31:31.670
There's still a chance to use this mirror.

31:31.807 --> 31:34.423
For what?
We know this ogre is a monster.

31:34.476 --> 31:36.341
Perhaps he was just defending himself.

31:36.478 --> 31:39.641
Forgive her, Gaston.
She gets this idealism from her mother.

31:39.773 --> 31:42.936
Father, we must know the truth
before we hurt him.

31:42.984 --> 31:46.602
Go home, Belle. It's what's best.

31:47.614 --> 31:51.823
Belle, it will be fine. I promise.

31:58.667 --> 31:59.998
GOLD: What kind of deal?

32:00.043 --> 32:02.204
Well, it doesn't matter
because I said no.

32:02.337 --> 32:04.794
Take it from a man who trades in deals.
It matters very much.

32:04.840 --> 32:06.171
What was the deal, Belle?

32:06.299 --> 32:08.460
If I tell you,
you gotta promise me something.

32:08.510 --> 32:13.345
You have to promise me you won't hurt
Gaston. No matter what you learn.

32:13.473 --> 32:16.180
Belle, you can trust me.

32:17.519 --> 32:18.508
All right.

32:18.562 --> 32:22.726
He said that if I let you and Gaston
face each other,

32:22.858 --> 32:26.191
and one of you ends up
in the River of Souls,

32:26.319 --> 32:28.230
he'll then tear up the contract
on our baby.

32:30.407 --> 32:32.022
And you turned him down.

32:32.075 --> 32:35.533
Of course I did. I failed once
with Gaston, but I can fix this.

32:35.579 --> 32:40.039
Belle, what Merlin said about
a man that can control dark for good...

32:40.083 --> 32:43.917
I really want to be that man for you.
Truly.

32:44.045 --> 32:46.832

33:53.615 --> 33:57.153
you gotta hit him right in the eye.

33:58.495 --> 33:59.951
No!

33:59.996 --> 34:01.281
What are you doing?
Get away from that thing!

34:01.331 --> 34:03.617
I won't let you kill him
without knowing the truth.

34:03.667 --> 34:07.251
It tried to kill me,
and that's all I need to know.

-No!

You...

34:28.650 --> 34:30.106
You did this, didn't you?

34:30.151 --> 34:34.315
You tortured this ogre while I was gone.
That's why he attacked you.

34:34.447 --> 34:38.440
I don't need an enchanted mirror
to recognize a monster.

34:38.493 --> 34:41.155
I'm trying to protect this kingdom.

34:41.288 --> 34:42.494
Step aside.

34:42.622 --> 34:45.364
This creature isn't the monster. You are.

34:45.500 --> 34:49.163
And if you want to shoot him,
you'll have to shoot me first.

35:02.726 --> 35:05.513
You've made a fateful decision tonight.

35:06.229 --> 35:10.973
I just hope, for all our sake,
it was the right one.

35:23.830 --> 35:25.570
Revenge is such a tricky business.

35:26.374 --> 35:31.334
I find it rarely ends well.
Unless, of course, you're me.

35:31.379 --> 35:36.043
And now, you get to spend eternity
trapped in these waters.

37:16.776 --> 37:18.107
It was foolish and petulant.

No. I did what I had to,
to live with myself.

Has it occurred to you

37:24.159 --> 37:27.196
that our mistreatment of their young
could have caused this conflict,

37:27.328 --> 37:28.943
not my act of mercy?

37:28.997 --> 37:31.659
The reasons why no longer matter.

37:31.791 --> 37:36.501
What does is that we must do
what it takes to save the kingdom.

(SIGHS) I'm sorry, Father,
I'm sorry that it's come to this.
