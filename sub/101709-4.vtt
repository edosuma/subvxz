10:14.250 --> 10:16.417
<i>Oh, oh. </i><i>That's my resident.</i>

10:16.500 --> 10:17.875
<i>And... joy's over.</i>

10:17.959 --> 10:19.208
[sighs] Until dinner tonight.

10:19.291 --> 10:20.959
Until dinner tonight.

10:23.500 --> 10:25.583
[Dave] My great-grandpa was an accountant,

10:25.667 --> 10:28.333
but no one would hire him
after he came back from camp.

10:29.000 --> 10:32.333
So he got a job as a line cook in a diner

10:32.417 --> 10:34.041
and eventually started Toyo.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.250
<i>-Where was he interned?</i>
-Tule Lake.

10:37.333 --> 10:39.291
<i>My great-grandparents </i><i>were sent to Jerome.</i>

10:39.375 --> 10:41.000
<i>I'm Gosei </i><i>on my mom's side.</i>

10:41.083 --> 10:42.208
Scans up yet?

10:42.291 --> 10:44.291
-[beep]
-Yep, just came up.

10:45.208 --> 10:46.750
-[keys clacking]
-Dr. Hunt, I read

10:46.834 --> 10:48.709
that you initially diagnosed appendicitis,

10:48.792 --> 10:50.250
but these scans show pelvic free fluid

10:50.333 --> 10:51.959
and a paracolonic abscess.

10:52.083 --> 10:54.125
I think he might have
right-sided diverticulitis.

10:54.500 --> 10:55.875
[sighs] Yep.

10:55.959 --> 10:58.083
And it looks like it's perforated.

10:58.166 --> 10:59.792
Plus, his X-rays show a broken collarbone.

10:59.875 --> 11:01.709
Okay, book an OR,
and I'll meet you up there.

11:01.792 --> 11:03.250
We need to get him up there right now.

11:03.333 --> 11:05.417
Really? We-- We as in me?

11:05.500 --> 11:07.333
Yeah, it's your diagnosis.

11:07.417 --> 11:09.250
-[exhales sharply]
-Good catch, Tseng.

11:12.834 --> 11:14.583
[keys clacking]

11:15.083 --> 11:16.250
Congratulations.

11:16.333 --> 11:19.667
You just ordered Nathan Ramos
a pregnancy test.

11:19.750 --> 11:22.000
[Intern Sara] What? How?

11:24.208 --> 11:25.792
-Hey.
-Hey.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.041
Hey.

11:30.083 --> 11:31.625
You already said that.

11:32.166 --> 11:34.125
[Woman on P.A.] <i>Portable X-ray</i>

11:36.125 --> 11:37.959
[Intern Sara] Ooh! He cute. [giggles]

11:38.041 --> 11:40.333
-No one asked you.
-Okay.

11:40.417 --> 11:42.500
[Jackson] Wait. No, no, no. Wait.
She kicked you out of bed,

11:42.583 --> 11:45.291
-so you were, like, what, naked?
-I'm naked. Naked.

11:45.375 --> 11:47.959
I was naked in bed with
my boyfriend, and she just--

11:48.041 --> 11:49.917
And it wasn't just one time either.

11:50.041 --> 11:52.583
I mean, it kind of says
less about him than her.

11:52.667 --> 11:54.166
Really, though? Does it?

11:54.250 --> 11:55.917
Yeah. Mer's like a force of nature.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.083
[both chuckle]

11:57.166 --> 11:58.917
Yeah. That's right.

11:59.750 --> 12:01.792
She's a force of nature. She, um...

12:04.792 --> 12:07.417
She's gonna beat this thing. Right?

12:09.000 --> 12:09.917
Right.

12:10.500 --> 12:12.458
Right. Yeah.

12:14.041 --> 12:16.250
[waves crashing]

12:16.333 --> 12:18.667
[seagulls crying]

12:20.917 --> 12:22.917
Derek said the sand isn't real.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.125
Yeah, no. Neither is the ocean.

12:25.208 --> 12:26.709
It <i>is </i>nice, though.

12:28.625 --> 12:30.542
I wouldn't want to leave either.

12:31.333 --> 12:32.458
The beach?

12:32.542 --> 12:34.709
Your kids. [chuckles]

12:36.667 --> 12:38.291
Got great kids.

12:38.375 --> 12:41.583
They're the best. You didn't meet them.

12:41.667 --> 12:43.291
I check in sometimes.

12:45.041 --> 12:46.625
How did you get older?

12:47.500 --> 12:49.750
Sand isn't real, the ocean isn't real.

12:49.834 --> 12:52.333
The body... it's not real.

12:54.125 --> 12:57.333
Maybe it's just more peaceful
for you to imagine me older?

12:58.917 --> 13:01.000
You sound like a fortune cookie.

13:01.083 --> 13:02.500
[both laughing]

13:09.166 --> 13:10.125
[sighs]

13:12.166 --> 13:14.083
Do <i>I </i>choose?

13:14.166 --> 13:17.333
Do I get to decide if I go back?

13:17.417 --> 13:20.000
I don't know. <i>I </i>didn't.

13:22.333 --> 13:25.625
I would have stayed if I could have.

13:27.125 --> 13:28.792
It's different for everyone, though.

[monitor beeping]

13:39.500 --> 13:40.667
[door opens]

13:40.750 --> 13:42.000
She's still asleep?

13:42.083 --> 13:43.625
[Richard] She needs her rest.

13:43.709 --> 13:45.750
[Bailey] You want to wake her
and ask her about the trial?

13:45.834 --> 13:47.834
-I tried.
-How hard?

13:49.500 --> 13:51.500
She needs her rest, Bailey.

13:51.709 --> 13:53.208
If you think I'm struggling
with the decision,

13:53.291 --> 13:54.917
how do you think <i>she's </i>gonna do?

13:57.417 --> 14:00.542
You want to talk pros and cons?

14:00.625 --> 14:02.625
We don't know anything about the virus,

14:02.709 --> 14:05.250
so we don't know anything
about the treatment,

14:05.333 --> 14:08.333
so we don't know any of the pros
or any of the cons.

14:09.250 --> 14:11.667
Let's just see if the proning helps.

14:15.083 --> 14:16.875

[Nana Ante] <i>The boy refused</i>

<i>Collared shirts, slacks, </i><i>even jeans.</i>

14:28.542 --> 14:30.458
Look. Buttons confine, okay?

14:30.542 --> 14:33.333
Now, elastic waistbands give you freedom.

14:33.417 --> 14:35.458
<i>You better not be wearing</i>
<i>elastic waistbands</i>

14:35.542 --> 14:36.625
<i>when you take Maggie out.</i>

14:36.709 --> 14:37.959

[Nana Ante] <i>Thanks, baby.</i>

14:44.291 --> 14:45.542
We're actually in the middle of dinner.

<i>Winston, </i><i>I invited your dad.</i>

14:49.917 --> 14:52.125
[Clifford] <i>So, who is this young lady?</i>

14:52.208 --> 14:54.500
Um, I'm Maggie Pierce.
I'm a friend of Winston's.

<i>let's try to be civil.</i>

15:27.208 --> 15:28.500
Civil, huh?

15:30.583 --> 15:31.583
Okay.

15:34.083 --> 15:36.542
<i>Happy birthday, Nana. </i><i>I love you.</i>

15:37.667 --> 15:38.750
Uh...

15:42.250 --> 15:43.875
So, is there cake?

[siren wailing at distance]

15:47.041 --> 15:48.041
[birds chirping]

15:48.125 --> 15:50.208
[Jo] Why are <i>you </i>up so early?

15:50.291 --> 15:52.333
[sighs] Front desk.
I got some breakfast delivered.

15:52.417 --> 15:53.375
Oh, you know what?

15:53.458 --> 15:55.542
If I was hungry, I would have
just eaten the cold pizza.

15:55.625 --> 15:57.750
Who said I got <i>you </i>any?

15:57.834 --> 15:59.959
Can't believe I fell asleep.

16:00.041 --> 16:02.625
Never should've started
a movie with two sequels.

16:02.709 --> 16:04.166
Prequels. They were prequels.

16:04.250 --> 16:06.917
And I said that, but you called me a wuss.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.208
[clears throat] Why is your couch

16:08.291 --> 16:09.875
more comfortable than my bed?

16:09.959 --> 16:12.417
Well, you're welcome to it
whenever you want.

16:13.375 --> 16:17.333
[clears throat] Thank you
for the friendship reboot.

16:18.083 --> 16:20.959
It almost made up for the last
time that I woke up here.

16:21.041 --> 16:22.542
Tried to rip the Band-Aid off too soon.

16:22.625 --> 16:23.959
It's behind us. We're good.

16:24.041 --> 16:25.625
Uh, but you can take the pizza with you.

16:25.709 --> 16:26.875
I'll grab it for you.

16:28.625 --> 16:30.125
[Jo] Wait.

16:33.083 --> 16:34.291
Mnh, mnh, mnh.

16:34.375 --> 16:36.041
I'm ripping off the Band-Aid.

16:48.750 --> 16:52.166
It's just a basic algorithm that
simulates the spread of COVID.

16:52.250 --> 16:55.375
Here's what it would look like
if everyone social-distanced.

16:55.458 --> 16:56.667
[key clacks]

16:56.750 --> 16:58.959

16:59.041 --> 17:01.834

17:01.917 --> 17:03.333
[key clacks, beeping]

17:03.417 --> 17:04.500
[chuckles]

17:04.583 --> 17:06.834
It's just a little stochastic S-I-R model

17:06.917 --> 17:08.750
that allows for multivariable inputs...

17:08.834 --> 17:09.959
[growling]

17:10.041 --> 17:13.375
...w-which I built by converting
a "Zombie Apocalypse" game.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.375
I <i>love </i>that game! How does yours end?

17:15.458 --> 17:16.875
I-I don't know yet.

17:16.959 --> 17:19.166
Same. I never got past level eight, so...

17:19.250 --> 17:20.834
Yeah, Helm, I appreciate your interest,

17:20.917 --> 17:22.458
but, uh, no one's gonna know
my test is negative

17:22.542 --> 17:24.125
if it never leaves my porch, hmm?

17:24.208 --> 17:26.166
Show's over.

17:26.250 --> 17:27.166
Bye-ee!

17:32.083 --> 17:34.542
[Meredith] I was devastated when you died.

17:34.625 --> 17:37.166
You were all cracking up at my funeral.

17:39.458 --> 17:40.959
Well, we were--

17:41.041 --> 17:42.041
No. What?

17:42.125 --> 17:44.125
What? No.

17:44.208 --> 17:46.500
It-- That made me happy.

17:50.208 --> 17:51.792
I was devastated.

17:52.583 --> 17:55.041
And then I was okay.

17:56.834 --> 17:58.667
And even with Derek...

17:58.750 --> 18:01.834
eventually you go on.

18:02.834 --> 18:04.750
And the kids would go on.

18:05.917 --> 18:07.041
They would, but...

18:08.166 --> 18:11.166
I think maybe with them it's different.

18:12.041 --> 18:13.500
My mom didn't go on.

18:13.583 --> 18:14.792
No?

18:14.875 --> 18:16.625
Not really, not like she used to.

18:18.125 --> 18:19.917
Some grief is--

18:21.083 --> 18:23.583
is heavier than other grief.

18:23.667 --> 18:25.250
Sometimes it moves through you,

18:25.333 --> 18:28.041
and sometimes it-- it just gets stuck.

18:29.083 --> 18:31.250
And you carry it. Like my mom.

18:32.458 --> 18:33.959
My mom carries it.

18:35.834 --> 18:38.208
Sometimes I try to shake it out of her.

18:39.834 --> 18:41.166
What?

18:41.959 --> 18:43.333
Like, you know...

18:43.417 --> 18:44.834
Like you haunt her?

18:44.917 --> 18:46.750
Well, I mean, if you want
to call it that, I...

18:46.834 --> 18:48.583
[laughs]

18:49.166 --> 18:52.291
I just want her to... let it go.

18:53.125 --> 18:54.792
I want her to know I'm still me

18:54.875 --> 18:57.917
even though she can't touch me
and she can't see me,

18:58.000 --> 18:59.500
but I am still me.

19:01.166 --> 19:02.250
It's not the same.

19:02.333 --> 19:03.458
No, I know.

19:10.417 --> 19:12.333
[monitor beeping]

19:12.417 --> 19:13.625
[indistinct conversations]

19:13.709 --> 19:15.125
You know, her sats were steady,

19:15.208 --> 19:16.458
but now they're just getting worse.

19:16.542 --> 19:18.500
I made some calls,
and there's another spot open

19:18.583 --> 19:21.000
in Dr. Kuo's trial,
but we have to act fast.

19:21.083 --> 19:24.208
Is there another spot
because another patient died?

19:27.750 --> 19:29.709
Have you seen the opacities in her lungs?

19:29.917 --> 19:31.333
Dr. Webber, at this point,

19:31.417 --> 19:33.375
you can either hope
that she wakes up again

19:33.458 --> 19:35.959
or you can make the decisions
that she chose you to make!

19:36.834 --> 19:38.333
I beg your pardon?

19:38.417 --> 19:41.792
The choice is between doing
nothing and doing something.

19:44.709 --> 19:46.250
Do something.

19:57.417 --> 19:58.917
-[Nico] You had to leave him open?
-[Owen] Yes.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.875
Once we got in, his colon was a mess.

20:00.959 --> 20:02.834
So we had to bring up an ileostomy

20:02.917 --> 20:05.041
and place an ABTHERA for the swelling.

20:05.125 --> 20:06.792
His clavicle's non-displaced.

20:06.875 --> 20:08.208
Fracture should heal quite nicely.

20:08.291 --> 20:09.875
-How soon?
-Till he can work again?

20:09.959 --> 20:11.333
Maybe a month.

20:11.417 --> 20:12.792
Tseng, let's diurese him overnight

20:12.875 --> 20:14.542
and let's put him on
the stand-by list for the OR

20:14.625 --> 20:16.083
in case we need to do a washout tomorrow.

20:17.208 --> 20:18.291
You did well today.

20:22.959 --> 20:24.500
Can I ask you something?

20:24.583 --> 20:26.667
Am I literally the only person
that can answer it?

20:26.750 --> 20:27.875
Kind of.

20:28.959 --> 20:30.625
Our patient's Asian-American.

20:31.917 --> 20:34.667
So right-side diverticulitis
was a greater possibility.

20:34.750 --> 20:36.959
But Dr. Hunt didn't scan him
when he first came in.

20:37.625 --> 20:39.166
So, what's your question?

20:39.250 --> 20:41.458
I think he should know so he
doesn't make this mistake again.

20:41.542 --> 20:43.417
But I don't know how to
talk to him about it.
