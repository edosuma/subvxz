10:44.227 --> 10:45.896
I'm tired.

10:46.938 --> 10:49.149
We're all tired.

10:49.191 --> 10:51.151
But they're hurting people.

10:51.193 --> 10:53.278
And sooner or later, they're
gonna hurt someone you love.

10:53.320 --> 10:54.738
Am I talking to you?

10:56.198 --> 10:57.741
STARLIGHT:
Look.

11:00.869 --> 11:06.792
I get that it's easier
to just disappear

11:06.833 --> 11:08.043
inside of yourself.

11:08.085 --> 11:10.295
Trust me, it's all I want to do.

11:10.337 --> 11:12.130
But we can't, Maeve.

11:12.172 --> 11:14.591
We can't.

11:14.633 --> 11:16.468
This is a war now,

11:16.510 --> 11:18.887
-and we...
-Shut the fuck up.

11:18.929 --> 11:20.931
Christ, you...

11:20.972 --> 11:23.392
Haven't I done enough for you?

11:26.686 --> 11:29.272
Didn't I save your fucking life?

11:32.067 --> 11:35.445
It doesn't matter what we do,
nothing changes.

11:40.117 --> 11:44.871
Nothing ever changes
or gets better.

11:49.084 --> 11:51.086
And I'm tired.

11:52.212 --> 11:54.798
Just leave.

11:56.633 --> 11:59.094
Go! Take your fucking twink

11:59.136 --> 12:01.680
and get the fuck out of here!

12:01.721 --> 12:04.766
Okay.

12:04.808 --> 12:06.810
Come on.

12:19.197 --> 12:21.366
(rapid footsteps)

12:21.408 --> 12:23.201
MICHEL:
Monsieur Charcuter, we need you.

12:23.243 --> 12:24.453
Now.

12:27.205 --> 12:29.541
BECCA:
He said he lives under
a pawnshop in East Flatbush!

12:29.583 --> 12:31.585
-He has to be here.
-Hey. Let her in.

12:31.626 --> 12:34.379
Fucking help me... Billy.

12:34.421 --> 12:37.632
(crying):
They took him.

12:37.674 --> 12:38.884
They have Ryan.

12:38.925 --> 12:40.594
Who's got him?

12:44.306 --> 12:46.266
I appreciate you coming
all this way, Stan.

12:46.308 --> 12:49.352
EDGAR:
Well, I can't exactly be seen

12:49.394 --> 12:52.772
with you at the Tower now,
can I?

12:52.814 --> 12:54.274
-Fresca?
-No.

12:54.316 --> 12:55.984
Thank you. Awful stuff.

12:58.320 --> 13:01.281
So, you've had a chance
to look over our proposal?

13:01.323 --> 13:04.534
He publicly confessed
to a sexual assault, Alastair.

13:04.576 --> 13:05.952
And we've made
a substantial investment

13:05.994 --> 13:07.787
in the Deep's rehabilitation.

13:07.829 --> 13:11.333
Our internal research bureau
shows an impressive Q rating.

13:11.374 --> 13:16.213
He's an asset to Vought
in these troubled times.

13:16.254 --> 13:19.591
Oh. What sort of commission is
the Church getting these days?

13:19.633 --> 13:21.801
40%? 50?

13:21.843 --> 13:23.595
Sounds like you're open
to reinstatement.

13:23.637 --> 13:24.930
That's fantastic.

13:26.973 --> 13:28.391
What about A-Train?

13:28.433 --> 13:31.645
You do need a speedster,
since Shockwave exploded.

13:31.686 --> 13:32.854
Harder sell.

13:32.896 --> 13:35.857
One has-been back is redemption.

13:35.899 --> 13:38.360
Two is weakness.

13:38.401 --> 13:40.195
Stormfront has problems
with him.

13:40.237 --> 13:43.615
And at the moment,
I have to indulge her.

13:43.657 --> 13:46.201
What's her problem with A-Train?

13:46.243 --> 13:49.412
I understand that she was
among your grandfather's

13:49.454 --> 13:53.500
first followers back when
the Collective was a start-up.

13:55.293 --> 13:57.546
I can neither
confirm nor deny that.

13:57.587 --> 13:59.548
(laughs softly)

13:59.589 --> 14:04.010
Then your internal
research bureau knows exactly

14:04.052 --> 14:06.680
what Stormfront's problem is
with A-Train.

14:07.931 --> 14:09.975
Deep is still a win.

14:10.016 --> 14:12.018
Shall I have Business Affairs
reach out?

14:12.060 --> 14:14.062
-Please do.
-Let me walk you out.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.411
(whispers):
Sons of bitches.

14:31.580 --> 14:33.748
(quietly):
Okay, yeah.

14:33.790 --> 14:37.210
Voilà. Uh, <i>jambon-beurre.</i>

14:37.252 --> 14:39.170
Simple, but it's the
ingredients, you know?

14:39.212 --> 14:40.589
-BECCA: Thank you.
-MOTHER'S MILK: Diet Coke

14:40.630 --> 14:42.799
with Lime, right?

14:42.841 --> 14:45.427
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

14:45.468 --> 14:46.845
We've heard a lot about you.

14:48.722 --> 14:51.808
Uh, I'm sorry, I-I wish

14:51.850 --> 14:53.393
I could say the same.

14:53.435 --> 14:55.812
Uh, you all close with Billy?

14:55.854 --> 14:57.731
Yeah.

14:57.772 --> 15:00.358
I mean... sure.

15:00.400 --> 15:03.153
-Why the hesitation?
-Well...

15:03.194 --> 15:06.906
Let's just say he ain't really
close to a lot of people.

15:06.948 --> 15:09.951
You know?
Well, except you, of course.

15:09.993 --> 15:11.953
I'm close to him.

15:11.995 --> 15:14.789
-I am.
-All right, all right, lads,
let's give her some air, eh?

15:14.831 --> 15:16.458
Yeah.

15:17.667 --> 15:19.919
So, Ryan ain't on
any of their social media,

15:19.961 --> 15:22.756
which is good on one hand,
but it don't help us none.

15:22.797 --> 15:24.841
-So, you think
he's in the Tower?
-Not sure.

15:24.883 --> 15:27.010
You stay here.

15:27.052 --> 15:30.555
Rest up. I'm gonna go
do a little digging.

15:30.597 --> 15:33.016
Hey, Billy.

15:34.809 --> 15:36.603
I'm sorry, okay?

15:36.645 --> 15:38.229
I have no right
to ask you to help me

15:38.271 --> 15:39.648
after what I said to you, but...

15:39.689 --> 15:42.984
Look, don't you worry,
all right?

15:43.026 --> 15:45.236
I will find your son.

15:49.783 --> 15:51.618
Thank you.

15:57.540 --> 15:59.542
Fuck off, you lot.

16:03.046 --> 16:04.839
(phone ringing)

16:04.881 --> 16:06.383
EDGAR:
What is it, Samantha?

16:06.424 --> 16:08.677
<i>SAMANTHA (over phone):
Mr. Edgar, normally,</i>

16:08.718 --> 16:10.303
<i>I wouldn't put this through,
but the man says</i>

16:10.345 --> 16:12.222
<i>it's life or death,
and you'd know him.</i>

16:12.263 --> 16:13.682
What's his name?

16:13.723 --> 16:15.225
<i>William Butcher.</i>

16:17.352 --> 16:18.895
Hi, hi.

16:18.937 --> 16:20.689
We've been having
a super fun time in here.

16:20.730 --> 16:23.483
I've just been googling all
the names of the cats in <i>Cats.</i>

16:23.525 --> 16:25.777
Can you believe Ryan
has never seen <i>Cats?</i>

16:25.819 --> 16:27.612
What happened to your hair?

16:27.654 --> 16:29.280
-Oh, nothing. (mutters)
-HOMELANDER: Hey, buddy.

16:29.322 --> 16:30.699
Sorry we had to leave you
all alone.

16:30.740 --> 16:33.660
Dad's work can sometimes
get pretty crazy.

16:33.702 --> 16:35.495
-(chuckles)
-ASHLEY: He hasn't been alone.

16:35.537 --> 16:37.914
I've been here. I got him
all these dipping sauces.

16:37.956 --> 16:40.291
You didn't want to play
<i>Vought Tournament of Heroes?</i>

16:40.333 --> 16:41.543
(whispers):
I'm the main guy.

16:41.584 --> 16:43.795
I was working on my states.

16:43.837 --> 16:47.090
-Uh, states?
-Well, yeah, I write down
all 50 states

16:47.132 --> 16:50.468
as fast as I can
in either alphabetical order

16:50.510 --> 16:52.095
or geographical order.

16:52.137 --> 16:54.180
You're giving yourself homework?

16:54.222 --> 16:56.850
Well, Mom says that learning
is a gift, so...

16:56.891 --> 16:59.853
Mm-hmm. That mom of yours,

16:59.894 --> 17:02.981
she sure does have
some cute little sayings.

17:04.983 --> 17:07.610
Do you think maybe
I could call her?

17:08.862 --> 17:09.946
Uh...
(exhales)

17:13.950 --> 17:15.910
Hey, Ryan.

17:15.952 --> 17:17.162
Ugh.

17:19.080 --> 17:21.958
I get it. I would feel lonely,
too, if I was cooped up

17:22.000 --> 17:25.837
all day by myself
in this West Elm Death Star.

17:27.213 --> 17:29.674
-Mm-hmm.
-STORMFRONT: How about

17:29.716 --> 17:31.676
we take a field trip?

17:31.718 --> 17:33.511
What do you say, Dad?

17:35.305 --> 17:36.890
<i>ANNOUNCER:
Welcome to Planet Vought.</i>

17:36.931 --> 17:39.017
<i>Have a super day.</i>

17:39.058 --> 17:40.185
(children shouting)

17:40.226 --> 17:41.853
(upbeat music playing)

17:41.895 --> 17:44.022
<i>ANNOUNCER: Let's give

17:44.063 --> 17:45.440
<i>to Kashden,

17:45.482 --> 17:47.025
Welcome to Planet Vought.

17:47.066 --> 17:48.485
Would you like to try our new

17:48.526 --> 17:51.654
Brave Maeve
Rainbow Veggie Burger?

17:51.696 --> 17:53.615
Holy shit.

17:58.620 --> 18:00.663
HOMELANDER:
There you go, Maestro.

18:03.208 --> 18:05.210
-Pretty cool, huh?
-Yeah.

18:05.251 --> 18:07.212
HOMELANDER:
(chuckles) Hey.

18:07.253 --> 18:09.631
Wait until you try the Big Homey
with bacon.

18:09.672 --> 18:11.466
It's so good.

18:11.508 --> 18:14.302
And-and the, uh,
and the Mocha Noir Shake?

18:14.344 --> 18:17.305
-It's amazing. And it won't be
lumpy like your mom's.

18:18.723 --> 18:20.308
(chuckles):
Hey.

18:20.350 --> 18:23.853
-Can I get a selfie?
-Ask the boss.

18:23.895 --> 18:25.480
(chuckles)
Kidding. Of course you can.

18:25.522 --> 18:28.233
-Of course you can.
-Stormfront? I-I love you.

18:28.274 --> 18:29.984
-Can I get a self-- a selfie?
-Oh, sure.

18:30.026 --> 18:31.402
STORMFRONT:
One at a time.

18:31.444 --> 18:32.779
-Homelander.
-STORMFRONT: Kids first.

18:32.821 --> 18:33.905

I'm a huge fan.

18:33.947 --> 18:35.365

18:42.872 --> 18:45.333
RYAN:
I want to go home.

18:45.375 --> 18:47.627
(clamoring continues)

18:47.669 --> 18:48.962
(whimpering)

18:49.003 --> 18:51.506
Hey. You okay?

18:51.548 --> 18:52.882
I want my mom.

18:52.924 --> 18:56.302
Okay, I got you. I got you.

18:56.344 --> 18:58.513
Thank you, everyone. Excuse me.

18:58.555 --> 19:01.641
Thank you. Excuse me. Excuse me.

19:01.683 --> 19:04.853
Stay back, please. Please,
please, please. Just stay back.

19:04.894 --> 19:07.105
Stay back. Thank you.

19:11.818 --> 19:12.819
-HUGHIE: New bling?
-STARLIGHT: Mm-hmm.

19:12.861 --> 19:15.238
Donna got it for me.

19:15.280 --> 19:17.532
Pretty sure she got it
at Duane Reade.

19:17.574 --> 19:20.368
(chuckles)

19:20.410 --> 19:22.579
Oh, gosh. Moms.

19:22.620 --> 19:27.250
The gift that keeps
on giving, forever.

19:30.003 --> 19:31.504
Oh, shit. I'm sorry.

19:31.546 --> 19:34.007
Wh-- No, it's-it's fine.

19:34.048 --> 19:36.426
No, no. I'm an asshole
for bitching about my mom

19:36.467 --> 19:38.303
when yours is...

19:39.762 --> 19:42.098
My mom's not dead.

19:42.140 --> 19:43.933
She's not?

19:43.975 --> 19:46.102
Oh, it's just, you never
mentioned her, so...

19:46.144 --> 19:48.271
She left when I was six.

19:48.313 --> 19:51.900
Oh, wow. Shit.

19:51.941 --> 19:53.568
I'm really sorry.

19:53.610 --> 19:58.990
That's where Billy Joel
comes from.

19:59.032 --> 20:01.659
She and I, we used to have
these dance parties.

20:01.701 --> 20:04.078
She was, she was fun.

20:04.120 --> 20:07.248
She made awesome Seven costumes
for Halloween.

20:07.290 --> 20:13.212
And, uh, then one day, she just
left and never called again.

20:13.254 --> 20:15.924
Not even a card.

20:15.965 --> 20:17.926
You know, it was like
some silent alarm went off

20:17.967 --> 20:20.595
and she was like, "Well...

20:20.637 --> 20:23.473
fuck them, time to go."

20:23.514 --> 20:25.808
No, I'm sure that that's not it.

20:25.850 --> 20:27.727
What would you call it?

20:31.439 --> 20:34.359
I guess that's why I always
just kind of hang in there,

20:34.400 --> 20:38.029
no matter how bad it gets.

20:38.071 --> 20:40.323
'Cause I...

20:40.365 --> 20:42.700
I-I don't want to be like her.

20:44.744 --> 20:48.665
That's kind of clingy
and pathetic, isn't it?

20:48.706 --> 20:50.750
No. No.

20:50.792 --> 20:52.669
It isn't.

20:52.710 --> 20:54.295
At all.

20:56.673 --> 20:58.424
-What's up, shitbirds?
-(both screaming)

20:58.466 --> 20:59.968
-STARLIGHT: Jesus Christ!
-(horn blaring)

21:00.009 --> 21:01.094
(tires screech)

21:01.135 --> 21:05.431
(panting) What the fuck?!
What the fuck?!

21:05.473 --> 21:07.266
-How did you find us?!
-Please.

21:07.308 --> 21:08.977
I can cover the boroughs in,
like, three hours.

21:09.018 --> 21:10.228
I went looking, that's all.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.230
I'm surprised your heart
can take it.

21:12.271 --> 21:14.482
My heart is just fine. Take
a step closer and I'll show you.

21:14.524 --> 21:15.817
HUGHIE:
Hey, I saved your life,

21:15.858 --> 21:18.027
asshole. And now
you're coming after <i>us?</i>

21:23.574 --> 21:24.784
We're even now, bitch.

21:29.330 --> 21:31.708
Holy shit!

21:31.749 --> 21:33.626
Is this true?

21:33.668 --> 21:36.504
-Everything makes a little more
sense now, doesn't it?
-Where did you get this?

21:36.546 --> 21:38.715
<i>I </i>didn't get it. Okay?
I was never here.

21:38.756 --> 21:40.967
You got that shit on your own.
Yeah?

21:41.009 --> 21:42.802
But wh-- why-why
are you doing this?

21:42.844 --> 21:44.137
'Cause I want back in.

21:44.178 --> 21:46.639
So, I need her gone.

21:46.681 --> 21:48.850
Fuck that Nazi bitch.

21:48.891 --> 21:50.435
(both shudder)

22:15.209 --> 22:17.462

the fucking hors d'oeuvres,

22:30.349 --> 22:33.186

just cut straight to it, yeah?

22:35.271 --> 22:37.148

only possible contingency

22:43.404 --> 22:45.364

22:45.406 --> 22:48.534
Now, that contingency don't work

23:00.004 --> 23:01.839
Homelander's a friend.

23:01.881 --> 23:03.925
Why would I betray him?

23:03.966 --> 23:06.677
Because you're
a ruthless bastard.

23:09.514 --> 23:10.556

V remained a secret,

23:43.089 --> 23:46.050

should bother you.

23:48.219 --> 23:50.721

entitled maniac.

24:09.365 --> 24:12.410

about anything different?

24:13.536 --> 24:15.246

24:15.288 --> 24:18.416

that racist bitch?

24:18.457 --> 24:21.836

from Homelander, all right?

24:24.255 --> 24:25.923

24:26.966 --> 24:28.968
That's my business.

24:30.344 --> 24:33.931

I'll call your people,

24:33.973 --> 24:35.516

on this cell signal,

24:35.558 --> 24:37.685

24:47.069 --> 24:48.446

Becca stays with me.

24:50.948 --> 24:52.992

24:53.034 --> 24:55.286

24:55.328 --> 24:56.621
Find him a new fucking mum.

24:56.662 --> 24:59.415
