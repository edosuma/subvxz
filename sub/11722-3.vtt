00:00.113 --> 00:01.312
My sweet Cassie,

00:01.337 --> 00:02.907
You finding this means
I'm gone,

00:02.932 --> 00:04.132
and for that,
I am so sorry.

00:04.157 --> 00:05.818
I didn't want you
to have this life.

00:05.843 --> 00:07.937
But destiny's not easy
to run from.

00:07.962 --> 00:09.158
Hi, I'm Diana.

00:09.159 --> 00:10.893
You seen her yet?
She got in yesterday.

00:10.894 --> 00:12.395
We're different.
You're different.

00:12.396 --> 00:15.498
You're a witch. You're a
full-blooded, 100% witch.

00:15.499 --> 00:18.201
You're here.
We have real power now.

00:18.202 --> 00:19.769
A complete circle is 6.

00:19.770 --> 00:21.204
You complete the circle.

00:21.205 --> 00:22.271
She's got the gift.

00:22.272 --> 00:24.607
You can get Cassie
to do what we need?

00:24.608 --> 00:26.809
Circle will take care of that
without even knowing it.

00:26.810 --> 00:29.679
Has Diana gotten to you about
binding the circle?

00:29.680 --> 00:32.052
Our energies are flying
everywhere, all at once,

00:32.078 --> 00:33.278
with no rhyme or reason.

00:33.350 --> 00:34.650
We need to bind the circle.

00:34.651 --> 00:36.385
Back off, Faye.

00:36.386 --> 00:38.754
No. You go away.
Aah!

00:38.755 --> 00:40.256
Faye, what did you do?

00:40.257 --> 00:42.792
If we can't control what
we feel or what we think,

00:42.793 --> 00:44.660
we're just gonna keep
hurting people.

00:44.661 --> 00:46.629
We have to
bind the circle.

00:53.437 --> 00:55.438
Lock, unlock.

00:55.439 --> 00:57.640
Lock, unlock.

00:59.843 --> 01:01.844
What happened to my magic?

01:01.845 --> 01:03.279
Could you be any louder?

01:03.280 --> 01:04.881
I can't open my locker.

01:04.882 --> 01:06.282
Did you try
the combination?

01:06.283 --> 01:09.318
Novel idea, Diana.
Why can't I do any spells?

01:09.319 --> 01:10.653
You can.

01:10.654 --> 01:12.154
I think that now that
we've bound the circle,

01:12.155 --> 01:13.656
we can only do
collective magic.

01:13.657 --> 01:14.824
Oh, you think?

01:14.825 --> 01:16.425
I never would have bound
the freakin' circle

01:16.426 --> 01:18.227
if it meant losing my power.

01:18.228 --> 01:20.429
You didn't lose
your power!

01:20.430 --> 01:21.831
According to the book, you just
have to have another member

01:21.832 --> 01:23.299
of the circle present.

01:23.300 --> 01:25.635
The more you have,
the greater your power.

01:25.636 --> 01:27.036
This sucks.

01:28.839 --> 01:31.841
Have you forgotten that
you almost killed Sally?

01:31.842 --> 01:34.710
Instead of complaining,
you should be thankful

01:34.711 --> 01:36.178
that things
are under control.

01:36.179 --> 01:38.748
And you better hope
she doesn't remember.

Hey, Cassie.
I left you a message.

02:05.842 --> 02:08.009
Uh, yeah, sorry.
I've been busy.

02:08.011 --> 02:09.578
Is everything all right?

02:09.579 --> 02:11.914
I was thinking we could
hang out tonight.

02:11.915 --> 02:13.616
Maybe we could talk
about what's been going on.

02:13.617 --> 02:16.151
Thanks, but I can't.

02:16.152 --> 02:18.921
What's wrong, Cassie?
Did I do something?

02:20.790 --> 02:23.792
I did your binding ritual
to get our powers under control

02:23.793 --> 02:25.160
so no one else
would get hurt.

02:25.161 --> 02:28.130
That doesn't mean we all need
to be friends.

02:28.131 --> 02:30.165
I know. But we can be.

02:30.166 --> 02:31.300
Or at least
you and I can.

02:31.301 --> 02:32.601
I don't like the secrets.

02:32.602 --> 02:34.203
And I don't like
lying to Sally

02:34.204 --> 02:35.571
about what really happened.

02:35.572 --> 02:37.589
This whole thing--
it's--it's too weird!

02:37.590 --> 02:40.392
I know. Which why I think
we should stick together.

02:40.393 --> 02:41.493
I'm sorry, Diana.

02:41.494 --> 02:44.529
It's the way it has to be.

02:52.738 --> 02:56.441
I like this...
Skipping school.

02:56.442 --> 02:58.843
Me, too.

02:58.844 --> 03:02.580
Hey, um...
I have this idea.

03:02.581 --> 03:04.616
It's gonna sound
kind of crazy.

03:04.617 --> 03:09.220
But there's this stupid
dance tomorrow.

03:09.221 --> 03:11.523
And I was thinking
we should go.

03:11.524 --> 03:14.058
You and me.

03:15.594 --> 03:18.696
You wanna shower first?
Or do you want me to go?

03:18.697 --> 03:20.698
That's all you
got to say?

03:20.699 --> 03:21.666
I just asked you out.

03:21.667 --> 03:24.636
You said we were just sex,
Melissa.

03:24.637 --> 03:26.971
You didn't want
anyone to know about us.

03:26.972 --> 03:28.606
I didn't want people
to think I was slutty.

03:28.607 --> 03:30.642
Then why do you want to go
to the dance together?

03:30.643 --> 03:32.444
Because I'm feeling
kind of slutty.

03:32.445 --> 03:34.712
What if Faye finds out?

03:34.713 --> 03:36.648
Maybe I'm ok
with it now.

03:36.649 --> 03:38.550
It's just
a school dance.

03:38.551 --> 03:40.618
I don't do dances.

03:40.619 --> 03:42.187
I just thought it would
be nice to do something

03:42.188 --> 03:43.755
that doesn't
involve sex.

03:43.756 --> 03:45.223
We're not dating, Melissa.

03:45.224 --> 03:48.560
If that's where
this is going, we're done.

03:48.561 --> 03:50.395
You're dick!

03:53.299 --> 03:55.900
I know your secret.

03:55.901 --> 03:57.602
What?

03:57.603 --> 04:01.473
You haven't signed up for any
extracurriculars.

04:01.474 --> 04:04.309
Oh. Right. I forgot.

04:04.310 --> 04:07.579
So I was hoping you could
help me with the dance.

04:07.580 --> 04:10.148
My streamer hanging arm
has seen better days.

04:10.149 --> 04:11.483
Yes, sure.
Whatever I can do.

04:11.484 --> 04:13.785
I'm just--
I'm glad you're ok.

04:15.287 --> 04:17.988
Last night was crazy, huh?

04:17.990 --> 04:20.492
The doctor said
I was really lucky.

04:20.493 --> 04:23.528
I never actually
saw what happened.

04:23.529 --> 04:27.031
Me neither.
It was all a blur.

04:27.032 --> 04:32.470
But I keep getting
these flashes of Faye.

04:32.471 --> 04:34.539
Like she did it.

04:34.540 --> 04:38.243
Faye?! How?
That's impossible.

04:38.244 --> 04:39.844
I know it sounds crazy.

04:39.845 --> 04:45.483
But I have this distinct memory
of her giving me her bitch stare

04:45.484 --> 04:47.385
and then me waking up
on the rocks.

04:47.386 --> 04:49.621
Wow. She gives me
that stare every day.

04:49.622 --> 04:52.156
Maybe I should start wearing
a helmet to school.

04:52.157 --> 04:54.893
I know.
It's ridiculous, right?

04:54.894 --> 04:57.762
I refuse to let that
girl get inside my head.

04:57.763 --> 04:59.564
Forget I said anything.

05:03.402 --> 05:04.969
Hey, Adam.

05:04.970 --> 05:06.204
Hey.

05:06.205 --> 05:08.706
So tell me about
this new Cassie girl.

05:08.707 --> 05:09.941
What about her?

05:09.942 --> 05:10.909
I've seen you talking
to her.

05:10.910 --> 05:11.843
Is she friends
with Diana?

05:11.844 --> 05:13.311
What do you want, Luke?

05:13.312 --> 05:14.846
An introduction.

05:14.847 --> 05:16.414
No, I don't think so.

05:16.415 --> 05:17.649
She's going through a hard time
right now, all right?

05:17.650 --> 05:18.950
Yeah, I know the story.

05:18.951 --> 05:20.885
Her mom's died.
Lives with her grandmother.

05:20.886 --> 05:24.789
She's bummin'. Maybe she
could use someone to talk to.

05:24.790 --> 05:25.990
Have a good time.

05:25.991 --> 05:29.794
Sure. Yeah, I guess.

05:29.795 --> 05:31.362
Yes!

05:34.633 --> 05:37.068
Things go smoothly?

05:38.871 --> 05:42.040
Henry's body is
at the lake house.

05:42.041 --> 05:44.776
It won't be found
until it needs to be.

05:46.979 --> 05:48.680
Thank you, Charles.

05:48.681 --> 05:51.416
Henry brought this
on himself, Dawn.

05:51.417 --> 05:53.985
You had no choice.

05:53.986 --> 05:57.522
Doesn't make it
any easier.

05:57.523 --> 06:00.391
He was Faye's
grandfather.

06:01.527 --> 06:03.261
Well, I searched Henry's house.

06:03.262 --> 06:05.229
There was no sign
of a crystal.

06:09.368 --> 06:11.669
I watched the whole thing.

06:11.670 --> 06:13.605
The circle is bound.

06:13.606 --> 06:15.239
We have to move fast,
Charles.

06:15.240 --> 06:19.477
Before someone
else catches on to us.

06:19.478 --> 06:22.113
There are still people in this
town who remember...

06:28.654 --> 06:30.955
Hey, honey.

06:30.956 --> 06:33.691
What are you doing here,
Dad?

06:33.692 --> 06:35.423
Some budget wrangling.

06:35.448 --> 06:36.648
You know I handle all
the school's legal work.

06:36.729 --> 06:37.829
Do you need a ride home?

06:37.830 --> 06:38.963
No, I'm good.

06:38.964 --> 06:41.265
Ok. I'll see you
at home.

06:46.805 --> 06:48.640
He's so cute.

06:48.641 --> 06:49.641
But taken.

06:49.642 --> 06:52.543
No, the other cute one.
I know Adam's taken.

06:53.812 --> 06:55.313
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:55.314 --> 06:56.414
Glad to see you're
up and around.

06:56.415 --> 06:57.882
Thanks Adam.

06:57.883 --> 07:00.462
Uh, Cassie, I want you
to meet a friend of mine.

07:00.463 --> 07:01.160
This is Luke.

07:01.161 --> 07:03.421
Hi, Cassie.
Nice to meet you.

07:03.491 --> 07:04.758
Yeah, you too.

07:04.793 --> 07:06.700
If you ever need someone
to show you around

07:06.701 --> 07:08.535
or you just wanna hang out,

07:08.761 --> 07:10.662
I'm available.

07:12.031 --> 07:14.666
I'll see you guys,
later.

07:14.667 --> 07:15.800
Heh.

07:19.204 --> 07:21.806
Yeah, me too.
I'll see you later.

07:26.378 --> 07:28.680
You know, there's
a dance tomorrow night?

07:28.681 --> 07:30.748
Yeah, I'm helping
Sally with it.

07:30.749 --> 07:31.916
Decorating committee.

07:31.917 --> 07:34.152
So, you're going.
With anyone?

07:34.153 --> 07:35.520
Sally.

07:35.521 --> 07:37.155
Right. Obviously.

07:37.156 --> 07:39.390
But, you know,
with her sling,

07:39.391 --> 07:41.893
it's probably gonna be
hard for her to dance.

07:41.894 --> 07:45.530
So I could fill in
for her.

07:45.531 --> 07:47.598
If you want.

07:47.599 --> 07:52.737
Uh, that's my awkward
way of asking you to the dance.

07:52.738 --> 07:55.206
Well, I appreciate you asking.

07:55.207 --> 07:56.641
Mm-hmm.

07:56.642 --> 07:58.976
But I have never decorated
a school dance before,

07:58.977 --> 08:01.546
much less attended.

08:01.547 --> 08:03.681
Rain check?

08:03.682 --> 08:06.718
Yeah, sure.

08:10.756 --> 08:14.759
There you go.

08:20.833 --> 08:23.201
The projector is being
set up in the afternoon.

08:23.202 --> 08:24.936
And most of the lights
are already up.

08:24.937 --> 08:27.638
We have to go over music
with the DJ.

08:28.941 --> 08:32.477
We also need 4 circular tables
from the cafeteria

08:32.477 --> 08:35.246
and then all the stackable chairs
we can get.

08:35.246 --> 08:37.749
So Luke asked you
to the dance.

08:37.750 --> 08:40.985
Sort of. I guess.

08:40.986 --> 08:42.820
But you turned him down.

08:42.821 --> 08:44.255
Kind of.

08:44.256 --> 08:46.724
Because you can't stop
staring at Adam?

08:46.725 --> 08:50.094
What? No. Not at all.

08:50.095 --> 08:53.798
Adam is dating...Diana.

08:53.799 --> 08:59.270
And yet for some reason he can't
stop staring at you either.

09:01.006 --> 09:03.975
Those two have been together
since the Earth cooled.

09:03.976 --> 09:05.476
Maybe there's trouble
in paradise,

09:05.477 --> 09:07.478
and it's time to let
those eyes wander.

09:07.479 --> 09:09.781
I'm not that person.
I know.

09:09.782 --> 09:13.985
It's just too bad Luke doesn't
have Adam's soulful eyes.

09:13.986 --> 09:17.088
You are terrible.

09:17.089 --> 09:20.792
I'll see you tomorrow.

09:20.793 --> 09:21.893
Hey.

09:21.894 --> 09:24.195
Hey.

09:24.196 --> 09:27.231
So what did you
think of Luke?

09:27.232 --> 09:30.067
He seems nice.

09:30.068 --> 09:33.738
You guys going to go
to the dance together?

09:33.739 --> 09:37.008
I don't know. Maybe.

09:39.000 --> 09:45.074

09:47.786 --> 09:50.288
Hey, Luke.

09:50.289 --> 09:52.790
Uh, does your offer
still stand?

09:52.791 --> 09:54.892
Absolutely.

09:54.893 --> 09:57.495
'Cause I could use a date
to the dance tomorrow night.

09:57.496 --> 09:59.096
Perfect.
Should I pick you up?

09:59.097 --> 10:01.265
I'll meet you there.

10:01.266 --> 10:03.100
That works, too.

10:03.101 --> 10:04.836
Ok.

10:21.787 --> 10:23.855
Cassie Blake?

10:23.856 --> 10:25.056
Yes.

10:25.057 --> 10:29.126
My name's Zachary.
I just saw you inside.

10:29.127 --> 10:31.863
It's amazing.
You look just like your mother.

10:31.864 --> 10:33.831
Oh.

10:33.832 --> 10:36.033
Thank you.

10:36.034 --> 10:37.268
You knew her?

10:37.269 --> 10:40.238
Yeah, we were good friends.

10:40.239 --> 10:44.141
Is she here?
Is she in town?

10:44.142 --> 10:47.078
No.

10:47.079 --> 10:49.180
She passed away.

10:50.249 --> 10:53.985
Oh, I didn't realize...

10:53.986 --> 10:57.154
I'm sorry.

10:57.155 --> 11:00.424
I work on fishing boat.
I don't get into town much.

11:04.029 --> 11:05.630
What brings you
to Chance Harbor?

11:05.631 --> 11:08.199
My grandmother
lives here.

11:08.200 --> 11:10.101
She's my only family.

11:11.236 --> 11:16.007
So you're staying then?

11:16.008 --> 11:17.074
You're going to live here?

11:17.075 --> 11:19.911
Yeah. That's the plan.

11:19.912 --> 11:23.814
Did you know your mother
vowed she'd never come back?

11:25.050 --> 11:27.652
I know she had
a difficult time here.

11:27.653 --> 11:29.720
You're right about that.
Do you know why?

11:29.721 --> 11:30.688
I should go.

11:30.689 --> 11:32.290
Do you know why she left?

11:32.291 --> 11:33.658
Do you know what she was?

11:33.659 --> 11:35.126
I don't know what
you're talking about.

11:35.127 --> 11:36.127
Don't lie to me.

11:36.128 --> 11:37.595
Let go of me!

11:37.596 --> 11:39.230
You're just like her.
You're a witch.

11:39.231 --> 11:41.299
Let go! Let go of me!

11:41.300 --> 11:42.800
Let go of her!

11:46.738 --> 11:48.072
You shouldn't have come here.

11:48.073 --> 11:50.441
I'm not going
to let this happen again.

12:10.138 --> 12:12.073
Oh, it's just you.

12:12.074 --> 12:13.307
Disappointed?

12:13.308 --> 12:16.143
Imagine me realizing the only
way to get something to move

12:16.144 --> 12:18.612
is with my actual hands.

12:20.082 --> 12:21.248
Where's Nick?

12:21.249 --> 12:22.316
I'm sure he'll be here.

12:22.317 --> 12:24.051
What's with
the emergency?

12:24.052 --> 12:27.054
Cassie was attacked.

12:27.055 --> 12:28.222
Who attacked you?

12:28.223 --> 12:29.657
I don't know. Zachary.

12:29.658 --> 12:30.925
He works on a fishing boat.

12:30.926 --> 12:33.094
Said he was
friends with my mom.

12:33.095 --> 12:35.362
I know who he is...
Sort of.

12:35.363 --> 12:37.932
He--he comes into the boathouse
every once in a while.

12:37.933 --> 12:40.334
He always just
stays to himself.

12:40.335 --> 12:41.702
He knew my mom
was a witch.

12:41.703 --> 12:43.270
And he tried to get me
to admit that I was, too.

12:43.271 --> 12:46.173
But then Diana showed up
and we magically pushed him away.

12:46.174 --> 12:48.843
Magic? It worked?

12:48.844 --> 12:51.479
Like I told you it would...
with more than one of us.

12:51.480 --> 12:53.114
But the point is
Cassie was attacked

12:53.115 --> 12:54.748
and this guy
knows about us.

12:54.749 --> 12:56.283
It's not just him.

12:56.284 --> 12:59.653
Sally was asking questions
about Faye and the accident.

12:59.654 --> 13:01.422
- She was?
- That's not good.

13:01.423 --> 13:03.257
As long as we stay
together, we'll be ok.

13:03.258 --> 13:04.758
We proved that today.

13:04.759 --> 13:07.728
Our power isn't random
and out of control anymore.

13:07.729 --> 13:09.663
It was like Cassie and I
shared the same thought.

13:09.664 --> 13:12.433
And it played out
exactly the way we wanted.

13:15.337 --> 13:16.604
Where are you going?

13:16.605 --> 13:18.739
I'm not sharing
my thoughts with anyone,

13:18.740 --> 13:21.142
especially Diana, who keeps
all the rules to herself.

13:21.143 --> 13:24.345
I need to find a spell that can
turn me back into a solo act.

13:24.346 --> 13:27.281
You should've told us we were
going to lose our individual powers.

13:27.282 --> 13:30.217
I didn't know.

13:30.218 --> 13:33.754
We haven't quite worked out
the kinks of getting along.

13:33.755 --> 13:35.156
I can see that.

13:35.157 --> 13:36.757
It'll be fine.

13:36.758 --> 13:39.360
We'll practice and learn
to work together better.

13:39.361 --> 13:41.962
It'll be fine, I promise.

13:41.963 --> 13:44.198
Look, I appreciate you
having my back.

13:44.199 --> 13:46.867
But you all need to figure
this out for yourselves.

13:46.868 --> 13:49.803
Cassie, the circle is nothing
if we're not together.

13:49.804 --> 13:51.739
We have to be.

13:51.740 --> 13:53.180
Unless you think you
could've handled that

13:53.205 --> 13:54.636
guy by yourself today.

14:04.219 --> 14:06.287
Diana?

14:06.288 --> 14:10.191
Diana, are you up?

14:13.195 --> 14:15.396
Diana?

14:17.132 --> 14:18.432
What's going on?

14:18.433 --> 14:21.068
Well, I was just at the
boathouse for coffee,

14:21.069 --> 14:23.237
and I heard about
the incident yesterday.

14:23.238 --> 14:25.172
Are you all right?
What happened?

14:25.173 --> 14:26.607
It was nothing.

14:26.608 --> 14:29.443
Just some weird
guy bugging Cassie.

14:29.444 --> 14:34.215
Zachary Larson.
What was he saying to her?

14:34.216 --> 14:35.482
I don't know.

14:35.483 --> 14:37.985
I just helped get
rid of him. Why? Who is he?

14:37.986 --> 14:40.454
He's just someone I went to
school with a long time ago.

14:40.455 --> 14:43.924
He's always been unbalanced,

14:43.925 --> 14:46.026
it would be best
if you stay away from him.

14:46.027 --> 14:49.096
I don't need convincing.
I will gladly stay away from him.

14:49.097 --> 14:50.497
Good.

14:50.498 --> 14:54.268
Dad, what's going on with you
and Mrs. Chamberlain?

14:54.269 --> 14:58.072
I told you.
I'm working with the school.

14:58.073 --> 15:00.941
You're a terrible liar.

15:02.978 --> 15:04.772
What would you say
if I told you that Dawn and

15:04.797 --> 15:06.130
I were seeing each other?

15:06.414 --> 15:08.315
Really?

15:08.316 --> 15:09.383
Would that bother you?

15:09.384 --> 15:11.785
No, not at all.

15:11.786 --> 15:15.089
I'm glad you're dating.
And she's great.

15:15.090 --> 15:17.191
We've just been spending
a little time together, that's all.

15:17.192 --> 15:19.460
Nothing serious.

15:19.461 --> 15:21.362
But you never know, right?

15:22.497 --> 15:25.032
I just want you to be happy.

15:25.033 --> 15:28.469
You--you've been alone
for too long.

15:29.471 --> 15:31.071
Thank you.

15:33.475 --> 15:35.075
It's just baby steps,
all right?

15:35.076 --> 15:38.579
Your mother is a hard
act to follow.

16:40.975 --> 16:42.576
My father said
he knew him in school

16:42.577 --> 16:44.111
and he was really bad news.

16:44.112 --> 16:47.047
He doesn't look
like that here.

16:47.048 --> 16:49.616
What exactly
did he say to you?

16:49.617 --> 16:53.520
Just that he knew my mother.

16:53.521 --> 16:56.657
And that
"It can't happen gain."

16:56.658 --> 16:59.259
Do you think
he meant the fire?

16:59.260 --> 17:01.195
I guess.

17:01.196 --> 17:10.137
What really happened
that night?

17:10.137 --> 17:12.005
And no one else knows
what really happened.

17:12.006 --> 17:15.476
It looks like
Zachary Larson does.

17:15.477 --> 17:16.710
Then we need to find out.

17:19.481 --> 17:21.982
I'm glad you called.

17:24.519 --> 17:28.188
Let's concentrate on it
at the exact same time.

17:31.526 --> 17:33.460
Are you concentrating?

17:33.461 --> 17:35.396
Trying. It's harder when I'm
answering your questions.

17:35.397 --> 17:38.974
When I count to 3,
focus all your energy

17:38.999 --> 17:40.499
on moving it toward me.

17:40.502 --> 17:41.535
What are you doing?

17:41.536 --> 17:43.504
Trying to figure out this
bound magic nightmare.

17:43.505 --> 17:46.073
Ready?

17:46.074 --> 17:50.744
1, 2...3.

17:55.350 --> 17:57.050
We did it.

17:57.051 --> 17:59.520
Last week I was setting
things on fire

17:59.521 --> 18:01.555
without having to hold
someone's hand to do it.

18:01.556 --> 18:03.624
But who knows
what else we can do.

18:03.625 --> 18:06.560
According to Diana the more of us
doing the spell, the stronger it is.

18:06.561 --> 18:08.662
I wonder what we could do
with 3 of us.

18:08.663 --> 18:11.265
I've got an idea about what
we can do with 3 of us.

18:11.266 --> 18:12.766
Dream on, Nick.

18:12.767 --> 18:15.035
My mom's chaperoning
the dance tonight.

18:15.036 --> 18:16.470
So come over around 8:00
and we'll look for some...

18:16.471 --> 18:21.575
Actually, I was thinking I might
check out the dance later.

18:21.576 --> 18:25.245
At the school?
The school dance?

18:25.246 --> 18:27.347
Seriously?

18:27.348 --> 18:29.583
Yeah.
Why?

18:29.584 --> 18:31.385
Because I want to go.

18:31.386 --> 18:33.120
Just 'cause we're witches doesn't
mean we can't go to dances.

18:33.121 --> 18:35.389
No, we don't go to dances
because we're not lame.

18:35.390 --> 18:38.225
I like dancing
unlike some people.

18:38.226 --> 18:40.661
We're in high school!
You know, that's what kids do.

18:40.662 --> 18:42.095
And I want to do it, too.

18:42.096 --> 18:43.597
Go ahead. Have fun.

18:43.598 --> 18:45.132
You should come with.

18:45.133 --> 18:47.334
It'll be better than just
sitting here by yourself.

18:47.335 --> 18:48.602
That's ok.

18:48.603 --> 18:50.204
I don't mind being alone.

18:50.205 --> 18:52.673
Unlike you, Melissa,
I like myself.

19:09.757 --> 19:11.325
What's going on?

19:11.326 --> 19:15.095
Zachary Larson approached
Cassie yesterday.

19:15.096 --> 19:17.731
There's a name from the past.
What did he want?

19:17.732 --> 19:20.601
I don't know. But I don't think he
knows anything that could hurt us.

19:20.602 --> 19:22.102
He wasn't there that night.

19:22.103 --> 19:23.971
He was friends with Amelia.

19:23.972 --> 19:25.572
She wouldn't have told him
anything.

19:25.573 --> 19:27.441
We have no idea
what she told him.

19:27.442 --> 19:30.878
It's been 16 years.
Why would he start talking now?

19:30.879 --> 19:32.813
Because Amelia's daughter
is here.

19:32.814 --> 19:34.815
Just talk to him.

19:34.816 --> 19:36.617
I intend to.

19:36.618 --> 19:37.518
Give me the crystal.

19:37.519 --> 19:38.919
Just talk, ok?

19:38.920 --> 19:40.621
We can't kill everybody
who gets in our way.

19:40.622 --> 19:42.923
Suddenly
you have scruples?

19:42.924 --> 19:44.758
Dead bodies tend
to raise questions.

19:44.759 --> 19:46.527
It's not smart.

19:46.528 --> 19:49.162
Fine.

19:49.163 --> 19:50.850
Oh, by the way,

19:50.875 --> 19:53.408
I told Diana that
we're dating.

19:53.735 --> 19:56.436
- You did what?!
- I had no choice.

19:56.702 --> 19:59.037
She knew I was lying to her
about seeing you at school.

19:59.173 --> 20:01.542
But she believed this?

20:01.543 --> 20:03.143
Yes, she did.

20:03.144 --> 20:05.746
Is that so hard
to imagine?

20:07.348 --> 20:10.350
Just...Talk to Zachary.

20:42.617 --> 20:45.619
"Air around me,

20:45.620 --> 20:47.788
grant me fire."

20:50.660 --> 20:51.860
"Air around me,

20:52.627 --> 20:55.596
grant me fire."

21:08.540 --> 21:10.274
Who are you?

21:12.143 --> 21:14.812
Stay away from me.
I'm calling the police.

21:14.813 --> 21:16.480
And tell them what?

21:16.481 --> 21:18.315
That the 6 of you are witches?

21:19.539 --> 21:20.739
How do you know that?

21:20.959 --> 21:21.992
I know your families.

21:21.993 --> 21:24.094
I know you,
and I know your friends.

21:24.095 --> 21:27.064
I just have one question.

21:27.065 --> 21:28.466
Have you bound
your circle?

21:31.002 --> 21:33.037
Don't come any closer.
I'm serious.

21:33.038 --> 21:34.205
Then stop me.

21:40.111 --> 21:42.179
Alone you have no power.

21:42.721 --> 21:44.208
You've already
bound your circle.

22:03.532 --> 22:05.299
You look amazing.

22:05.300 --> 22:07.001
So do you.

22:07.002 --> 22:08.135
Thanks.

22:08.136 --> 22:10.137
I'm...a little nervous.

22:10.138 --> 22:14.108
I didn't have a huge
social life at my old school.

22:14.109 --> 22:17.578
Or a small one
or any one at all actually.

22:17.579 --> 22:19.413
Are you saying
you're a loner?

22:19.414 --> 22:20.748
I've been called worse.

22:20.749 --> 22:23.017
Come on. Let's go
change all that.

22:40.368 --> 22:42.002
You showed up.

22:42.003 --> 22:44.271
What do you want from me,
Melissa?

22:44.272 --> 22:46.473
Nothing.

22:46.474 --> 22:49.009
I'm not dancing.

22:49.010 --> 22:51.245
That's ok.
I'm just glad you're here.

22:55.617 --> 22:59.353
Hey, future stepmother alert.

22:59.354 --> 23:02.122
Not funny!

23:02.123 --> 23:04.058
I should talk to her.

23:04.059 --> 23:05.759
She probably knows my dad
told me they're dating,

23:05.760 --> 23:06.927
and I don't want it
to be weird.

23:06.928 --> 23:10.114
You are way
too mature for me.

23:10.115 --> 23:11.849
Hi, Mrs. Chamberlain.

23:11.850 --> 23:13.784
Diana, how are you?
Having fun?

23:13.785 --> 23:15.786
I am. Yes. Thank you.

23:15.787 --> 23:18.022
I just wanted to say

23:18.023 --> 23:20.891
my dad told me you're
seeing each other.

23:20.892 --> 23:22.727
And I think it's great.

23:22.728 --> 23:25.029
And he seems
really happy about it.

23:25.030 --> 23:27.999
Well, your dad
is a special man.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.001
Yeah. He is.

23:30.002 --> 23:31.836
Have fun.

23:34.840 --> 23:36.273
Should I go get us
something to drink?

23:36.274 --> 23:37.842
Sure.

23:47.052 --> 23:49.053
Hey.

23:51.423 --> 23:52.957
You look nice.

23:52.958 --> 23:54.892
No compliments.

23:54.893 --> 23:56.694
Sorry.

23:56.695 --> 24:00.064
Guys, please dance.
No one is dancing.

24:00.065 --> 24:01.476
This can't be
one of those lame parties

24:01.501 --> 24:02.701
where no one dances.

24:03.335 --> 24:05.136
I don't know where Luke is.

24:05.137 --> 24:07.038
If you two go out there,

24:07.039 --> 24:09.040
I'm sure other
people will, too. Please?

24:09.041 --> 24:13.344
Hmm. I pretty sure
she did that on purpose.

24:13.345 --> 24:15.346
Why? She think you wanted
to dance with me?

24:15.347 --> 24:19.216
No. I don't know.
Can we not talk about this?

24:27.959 --> 24:30.294
Hey, you almost done?

24:30.295 --> 24:31.929
What's the rush?

24:31.930 --> 24:34.131
I like the song they're
playing in the gym.

24:34.132 --> 24:36.334
And I thought maybe

24:36.359 --> 24:39.056
I could change your mind
about dancing.

24:39.438 --> 24:40.471
Forget it.

24:40.472 --> 24:41.505
Oh, come on, Nick!

24:41.506 --> 24:42.807
You came all
the way here.

24:42.808 --> 24:44.008
Why not have
some fun together?

24:44.009 --> 24:45.943
Why do you like me?

24:45.944 --> 24:48.279
What kind of question
is that?

24:48.280 --> 24:52.016
I treat you like crap, and you
just keep coming back for more.

24:52.017 --> 24:56.120
I mean, do you just like
being dumped on or something?

24:56.121 --> 24:57.955
No, actually. I don't.

24:57.956 --> 24:59.087
- Melissa!
- What're you doing here?

24:59.088 --> 25:00.455
I was at the abandoned house,

25:00.456 --> 25:02.023
and some psycho broke in
and almost attacked me.

25:02.024 --> 25:04.426
I think it was the same guy
that attacked Cassie.

25:04.554 --> 25:07.022
He knew about us.

25:09.397 --> 25:13.133
I know you're trying to keep
your distance from me.

25:13.134 --> 25:16.136
And I understand.

25:16.137 --> 25:19.373
I think.

25:19.374 --> 25:23.677
I'm really glad that you reached
out to Diana today, though.

25:23.678 --> 25:26.113
She really wants
to be your friend.

25:26.114 --> 25:29.416
And that's nice of her but I'm
not so sure it's a great idea.

25:29.417 --> 25:30.584
Why?

25:30.585 --> 25:33.387
Why? Really?

25:33.388 --> 25:36.089
Because sometimes when we're
together, street lights explode.

25:36.090 --> 25:38.125
And I think that might be
weird for Diana.

25:38.126 --> 25:39.560
And you. And me.

25:39.561 --> 25:41.628
It's different now that
the circle is bound.

25:41.629 --> 25:44.031
Is it?

25:46.234 --> 25:49.136
I don't know, Cassie.

25:49.137 --> 25:51.605
But we have to make
this work somehow.

25:51.606 --> 25:53.841
For all of us.

25:56.244 --> 25:58.011
Adam!

25:58.012 --> 25:59.913
Someone broke into the abandoned
house when Faye was there.

25:59.914 --> 26:02.249
Sounds like it was
Zachary Larson.

26:05.086 --> 26:07.421
I had no power
to defend myself.

26:07.422 --> 26:09.489
I could've been killed,
all because you took away my magic.

26:09.490 --> 26:10.490
Don't blame Diana--

26:10.491 --> 26:12.059
It doesn't matter.

26:12.060 --> 26:13.160
What's important is we're
all in danger right now.

26:13.161 --> 26:14.695
Why is he coming after us?

26:14.696 --> 26:17.064
He knows about the circle
and he knows we bound it.

26:17.065 --> 26:19.266
He knew something about the fire
that killed our parents.

26:19.267 --> 26:20.467
How?

26:20.468 --> 26:21.735
Ok. I look him up online

26:21.736 --> 26:23.070
and couldn't find anything
else about him

26:23.071 --> 26:24.605
or how he's connected
to our families.

26:24.606 --> 26:25.739
Did you check school records?

26:25.740 --> 26:27.074
We don't have access
to those.

26:27.075 --> 26:29.509
You do if you have
your mom's master key.

26:36.117 --> 26:38.552
So this is where
the party is.

26:38.553 --> 26:40.587
I was, uh--

26:40.588 --> 26:43.908
I was just roping some people
into helping Sally with

26:43.933 --> 26:44.758
dance committee stuff.

26:44.759 --> 26:46.426
Cassie,
why don't you head back in?

26:46.427 --> 26:48.729
I will handle
the whole clean-up problem.

26:48.730 --> 26:51.431
You sure?

26:51.432 --> 26:53.300
Absolutely.

27:04.512 --> 27:07.614
Hello, Zachary.

27:07.615 --> 27:09.549
It's been a long time.

27:09.550 --> 27:11.718
Charles.

27:11.719 --> 27:14.121
I figured you'd be by.

27:14.122 --> 27:16.423
You've been bothering
my daughter.

27:16.424 --> 27:18.191
Why would you do
something like that?

27:18.192 --> 27:20.227
Your daughter's a witch.

27:20.228 --> 27:21.461
So are her friends.

27:21.462 --> 27:23.630
Witchcraft?

27:23.631 --> 27:25.565
Are we back
to those rumors?

27:25.566 --> 27:27.668
What are we?
Teenagers all over again?

27:27.669 --> 27:30.437
Charles,
I know what you are.

27:30.438 --> 27:33.941
Amelia and I were close,
she told me everything.

27:33.942 --> 27:37.010
The way I remember it,
Amelia hated you.

27:37.011 --> 27:38.445
The deeper she got in
with all of you

27:38.446 --> 27:42.716
the further she pushed me
and Heather away.

27:42.717 --> 27:45.285
Heather.

27:45.286 --> 27:46.486
What a shame.

27:46.487 --> 27:49.556
She never stopped
believing in Amelia.

27:49.557 --> 27:51.692
And look what happened.

27:51.693 --> 27:54.361
Now that Cassie Blake
is back,

27:54.362 --> 27:56.730
it's happening
all over again.

27:56.731 --> 27:59.399
You're paranoid.

27:59.400 --> 28:01.568
There's nothing
going on.

28:03.771 --> 28:06.173
You know they're practicing.

28:06.174 --> 28:09.109
And you're not stopping them.
What are you up to?

28:09.110 --> 28:12.546
That is the kind of accusation
that could get you in trouble.

28:12.547 --> 28:15.749
I hoped this day
would never come.

28:15.750 --> 28:18.085
I have no other choice.

28:41.909 --> 28:44.911
All I have to do
is kill one of them.

29:02.549 --> 29:04.350
Let me know if
you hear anyone coming.

29:04.351 --> 29:06.886
Oh, I'll be long gone.

29:10.323 --> 29:11.857
What's her mom's password?

29:11.858 --> 29:15.995
She said to try 02-25-95.
It's Faye's birthday.

29:15.996 --> 29:18.397
Really?

29:19.766 --> 29:21.734
Ah. All right.

29:26.373 --> 29:29.308
Ok. Average student.

29:29.309 --> 29:32.411
A few clubs,
track and field.

29:32.412 --> 29:33.979
Ok. Then it looks like he
started getting into trouble.

29:33.980 --> 29:36.515
He suspended for fighting.

29:36.516 --> 29:38.364
He was suspended
for skipping school with his

29:38.389 --> 29:40.205
girlfriend, Heather Barnes.

29:40.787 --> 29:41.769
Wait, Heather Barnes?

29:41.794 --> 29:43.594
I saw that name
in Cassie's yearbook.

29:43.657 --> 29:46.525
She's friends
with Amelia too.

29:46.526 --> 29:49.762
Like being at a dance
isn't boring enough...

29:53.366 --> 29:54.633
Did you come here for Nick?

29:54.634 --> 29:56.135
No.

29:57.704 --> 30:00.139
Hey. Did something happen?

30:01.308 --> 30:04.109
He hates me.
And I don't know why.

30:04.110 --> 30:07.413
Nick doesn't hate you.

30:07.414 --> 30:09.281
Nick hates Nick.

30:10.917 --> 30:13.452
He lost hs parents.
He has issues.

30:13.453 --> 30:14.386
We all did.

30:14.387 --> 30:16.422
We lost one. He lost both.

30:16.423 --> 30:18.791
He's double damaged.

30:25.131 --> 30:27.733
Heather Barnes was on
student council with Amelia.

30:27.734 --> 30:29.835
And yearbook and volleyball

30:29.836 --> 30:31.737
and a million
other things.

30:31.738 --> 30:34.473
Let me check something.

30:42.515 --> 30:45.751
That's the fire
that killed our parents.

30:45.752 --> 30:48.821
Why Heather Barnes?

30:48.822 --> 30:50.823
Was she with them?
Did she die, too?

30:50.824 --> 30:54.093
"Among the victims
was Heather Barnes."

30:54.094 --> 30:55.895
That's it.
That's all it says.

30:55.896 --> 30:57.963
What the hell?

30:57.964 --> 31:01.400
He's blaming what happened
to Heather on our parents?

31:02.202 --> 31:05.037
Yeah.

31:05.038 --> 31:07.406
But he's taking
it out on us.

31:13.980 --> 31:16.749
Well, everyone seems to
be having a good time.

31:16.750 --> 31:18.017
Sally will be relieved.

31:18.018 --> 31:20.085
Do you want to dance?

31:20.086 --> 31:22.254
I'm bad at it, just fyi.

31:22.255 --> 31:25.157
I'm good here, for now.
Maybe later?

31:25.158 --> 31:29.895
No, I don't think so.

31:29.896 --> 31:31.864
What's wrong?

31:31.865 --> 31:32.932
I think I'm gonna head out.

31:32.933 --> 31:34.800
But it's early.

31:34.801 --> 31:36.075
Look, I was cool about you

31:36.100 --> 31:37.499
jumping on the dance floor
with Adam--

31:37.688 --> 31:38.721
Sally made us do that.

31:38.722 --> 31:40.023
And about you ditching me

31:40.024 --> 31:41.958
to disappear into the hall
with your pals.

31:41.959 --> 31:45.762
But even when you're with me,
you're watching the door.

31:45.763 --> 31:46.930
Your mind's somewhere else.

31:46.931 --> 31:50.233
Luke, I'm sorry.
I really am.

31:51.456 --> 31:56.193
I'm actually
a pretty good date.

31:56.194 --> 31:59.863
It's too bad
you didn't give me a chance.

32:06.271 --> 32:08.305
Where the hell have you been?!

32:08.306 --> 32:10.774
- Around.
- Selling stuff?

32:10.775 --> 32:12.569
That guy who came after me
at the abandoned house?

32:12.570 --> 32:14.237
He's after all of us.

32:14.360 --> 32:15.094
Why?

32:15.119 --> 32:17.220
His girlfriend died
in the fire 16 years ago.

32:17.221 --> 32:19.289
He blames our parents.

32:19.290 --> 32:21.357
Mine are dead,
so he's outta luck.

32:21.358 --> 32:23.893
He's coming for us,
not them.

32:23.894 --> 32:28.331
And if you're going to date
Melissa, treat her right.

32:28.332 --> 32:30.900
We're not dating.
We just hang out.

32:30.901 --> 32:32.202
You're using her.

32:32.203 --> 32:33.403
And she's using me.
Works great.

32:33.404 --> 32:36.739
She's not using you.
She likes you.

32:36.740 --> 32:40.543
And she deserves better.
So, do it right or get lost.

33:03.167 --> 33:08.037
Who's there? Nick?

33:08.038 --> 33:09.739
Not funny.

33:27.760 --> 33:29.427
Dawn.

33:29.428 --> 33:31.996
What the hell happened to you?!

33:31.997 --> 33:34.270
Zachary attacked me.
He knows about the bound circle.

33:34.271 --> 33:35.371
He's coming
for the kids.

33:35.376 --> 33:36.205
Oh, my God.

33:36.206 --> 33:37.339
He'll do
whatever it takes.

33:37.340 --> 33:38.807
We can't let him
hurt them.

33:38.808 --> 33:39.975
Go outside. Watch the exits.

33:39.976 --> 33:41.143
He won't come
through the front.

33:41.144 --> 33:42.244
What if he's
already inside?

33:42.245 --> 33:43.545
Then we better hurry.

33:50.320 --> 33:51.954
Hey, have you seen Cassie?

33:51.955 --> 33:53.188
No.

33:53.189 --> 33:55.224
Sally said she left Luke, 
looking for us 20 minutes ago.

33:55.225 --> 33:56.458
We got to find her.

33:59.229 --> 34:01.764
Aah!

34:05.168 --> 34:08.170
Back to the gym, now!

34:38.835 --> 34:41.103
Aah!

34:43.005 --> 34:43.972
She's over there.

34:43.973 --> 34:46.007
What do we do?

34:46.009 --> 34:50.512
We're all here.
We're at full power, right?

34:50.513 --> 34:52.214
What can we do?

34:52.215 --> 34:54.216
Help!

35:00.156 --> 35:01.523
Let her go!

35:08.364 --> 35:09.732
I'm sorry Heather died.

35:09.733 --> 35:11.967
But Cassie
didn't kill her.

35:11.968 --> 35:13.691
Heather didn't die.

35:13.716 --> 35:16.411
What Amelia did to her
was far worse.

35:37.894 --> 35:40.329
Ok. Now what?

35:40.330 --> 35:42.498
Oh my God, is he dead?!

35:46.970 --> 35:48.137
No, he's breathing.

35:48.138 --> 35:49.872
Well, get away from him,
just in case.

35:49.873 --> 35:51.006
What are we going to do?

35:51.007 --> 35:52.541
We get the hell
out of here.

35:52.542 --> 35:54.276
We can't leave him.
The school is full of people.

35:54.277 --> 35:57.146
So what? We're the only
ones he wants to kill.

35:57.147 --> 35:58.347
We should call the police.

35:58.348 --> 35:59.381
And tell them what?

36:01.184 --> 36:02.284
What's going on?

36:02.285 --> 36:04.353
What happened?

36:04.354 --> 36:06.155
Mom, I can explain.

36:06.156 --> 36:07.656
He was chasing after us--

36:07.657 --> 36:09.291
because we saw him
breaking open lockers.

36:09.292 --> 36:10.592
Yeah, and then we threatened
to call the police,

36:10.593 --> 36:12.161
and he started
chasing after us.

36:12.162 --> 36:13.929
He slipped
on the papers and fell.

36:13.930 --> 36:16.331
He hit his head hard.

36:16.332 --> 36:18.033
He did all this by himself?

36:18.034 --> 36:20.269
We don't know.
We came in here and the hallway

36:20.270 --> 36:21.737
was already
such a disaster zone.

36:23.373 --> 36:27.543
I know this man.
He's an addict.

36:27.544 --> 36:31.346
He's been breaking in and
vandalizing this place for years.

36:31.347 --> 36:33.115
I don't want you guys
involved in this.

36:33.116 --> 36:34.349
Just go back
to the dance. Ok?

36:34.350 --> 36:36.518
I'm going to take care
of this from here.

36:48.264 --> 36:49.965
Charles...

36:49.966 --> 36:52.134
I've got him.

36:53.963 --> 36:54.913
What did your mother say?

36:54.914 --> 36:56.148
All she knows is that
Zachary's a crazy local

36:56.799 --> 36:57.732
who broke into the school.

36:57.733 --> 36:59.167
Are they going
to arrest him?

36:59.168 --> 37:00.935
And my mom said security took
him to the police station.

37:00.936 --> 37:02.870
Lucky for us, she asked
that they keep it quiet

37:02.871 --> 37:04.985
so it doesn't reflect badly
on the school.

37:05.010 --> 37:06.210
You guys saved my life.

37:07.943 --> 37:09.177
Don't get all
weepy about it.

37:09.178 --> 37:11.980
No, really. Thank you.

37:11.981 --> 37:13.982
All of you.

37:15.818 --> 37:17.919
See you losers tomorrow.

37:19.989 --> 37:22.023
I got to find out
what Zachary meant.

37:22.024 --> 37:24.025
What my mom
did to Heather Barnes--

37:24.026 --> 37:25.593
We will.
Just not tonight, please.

37:25.594 --> 37:27.996
I think we all just need
to get home right now.

37:27.997 --> 37:29.530
Come on. I'll give you bums
a ride home.

37:29.531 --> 37:31.032
It's ok. I'll make sure
Cassie gets home.

37:31.033 --> 37:32.867
Don't worry about it.
I'm fine.

37:32.868 --> 37:35.770
I just--I will sleep better knowing
that you got home safely.

37:48.150 --> 37:50.285
Hey, you wanna ride?

37:50.286 --> 37:51.819
I thought
I might walk awhile.

37:51.820 --> 37:54.622
I didn't mean to your house.
I meant to mine.

37:54.623 --> 37:59.327
I don't want that
anymore, Nick. Sorry.

37:59.328 --> 38:02.263
Maybe we could
just hang out.

38:02.264 --> 38:04.198
Watch a movie.

38:38.267 --> 38:42.003
I feel like I never knew
who my mom really was.

38:42.004 --> 38:44.939
I don't remember
my mother at all.

38:44.940 --> 38:48.843
I guess it must be harder
having known her.

38:49.878 --> 38:52.947
Well, thanks
for hanging with me.

38:56.218 --> 39:00.788
I know you didn't ask to be
a part of the circle.

39:00.789 --> 39:03.925
You've got
your whole loner thing.

39:03.926 --> 39:05.259
And I get it.

39:05.260 --> 39:08.262
And it's not like
Faye and I are BFFs.

39:08.263 --> 39:09.864
I mean,
she hates me most of the time.

39:09.865 --> 39:15.903
I just think we're better
together than we are apart.

39:15.904 --> 39:18.106
Power or no power.

39:19.875 --> 39:22.777
Sorry if I was rude to you.

39:26.014 --> 39:29.484
It's ok. I get it.

39:31.387 --> 39:34.489
I see the way he looks at you.

39:35.424 --> 39:40.027
No, it's nothing.

39:40.028 --> 39:43.364
I hope you're right.

39:43.365 --> 39:48.202
Because I love him.

39:49.872 --> 39:52.540
I've loved him
for as long as I can remember.

39:52.541 --> 39:55.009
You have nothing
to be worried about, Diana.

39:55.010 --> 39:59.147
I would never come
between you two.

40:01.984 --> 40:05.119
I really do like you,
Cassie.

40:05.120 --> 40:08.022
I want us to be friends.

40:09.191 --> 40:11.025
I'd like that.

40:59.141 --> 41:00.975
You've been marked.

41:00.976 --> 41:04.979
No matter where you go
or where you hide, I'll find you.

41:04.980 --> 41:09.884
And if you ever even look
at one of our children again,

41:09.885 --> 41:12.954
I will literally turn your life
into a living hell

41:12.955 --> 41:15.089
much worse
than Heather ever knew.
