00:18.720 --> 00:21.880
It is said that if
you tell the truth,

00:21.880 --> 00:24.760
it becomes part of your past.

00:24.760 --> 00:30.160
If you tell a lie,
it becomes part of your future.

00:30.160 --> 00:32.360
- But lying is not only done

00:32.360 --> 00:35.800
with words, but also
with silence.

00:38.680 --> 00:40.360
And on the subject
of her mother's

00:40.360 --> 00:44.640
mysterious disappearance,
those closest to Matilda,

00:44.640 --> 00:46.800
have been
the most silent of all.

00:50.520 --> 00:53.200
Whatever the reasons
behind their silence,

00:53.200 --> 00:57.160
Jane, Beth, and Cat Stone
have always feared the events

00:57.160 --> 00:59.760
surrounding their
sister's disappearance

00:59.760 --> 01:02.760
would one day come to light.

01:03.760 --> 01:05.760
For even the smallest of lies

01:05.760 --> 01:10.040
requires a bodyguard of
bigger lies to protect it.

01:11.520 --> 01:14.000
And that there would come
a time when,

01:14.000 --> 01:16.160
- however hard they tried...

01:16.160 --> 01:19.800
...even they would be unable
to protect Matilda

01:19.800 --> 01:22.160
from the truth.

03:10.600 --> 03:12.480
Kippers.

03:12.480 --> 03:14.680
Yum. Thank you.

03:20.280 --> 03:21.640
From George?

03:21.640 --> 03:23.000
Maybe.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.600
You've been seeing
a lot of him recently.

03:25.600 --> 03:27.920
Have I?

03:30.200 --> 03:31.280
Yeah, I suppose I have.

03:31.280 --> 03:32.760
- Morning.

03:32.760 --> 03:34.240
Thanks for running
the shop today, Cat.

03:34.240 --> 03:36.240
Oh, well, how hard can it be?

03:36.240 --> 03:37.440
Ready?

03:37.440 --> 03:40.320
Stupid question, but...why?

03:40.320 --> 03:42.160
Sound props.

03:42.160 --> 03:45.360
You can't record an audio book
without sound effects.

03:45.360 --> 03:46.720
Mm.

03:46.720 --> 03:48.120
The recording booth
at Heritage House

03:48.120 --> 03:49.880
has great acoustics.

03:49.880 --> 03:51.080
I cut my first demo there.

03:51.080 --> 03:52.360
And your last.

03:52.360 --> 03:54.120
They banned her after that.

03:54.120 --> 03:56.560
I paid for the damage.

03:56.560 --> 03:57.640
Eventually.

03:57.640 --> 03:59.400
I never liked the place.

03:59.400 --> 04:01.360
They used to make us go there
for school trips all the time.

04:01.360 --> 04:02.440
I think it's creepy.

04:02.440 --> 04:04.040
Oh, I don't know,

04:04.040 --> 04:07.880
I always thought
Heritage House was quite quaint.

04:12.080 --> 04:16.600
In truth, Matilda and
her aunt Jane were both correct.

04:18.920 --> 04:21.960
For Wildemarsh Heritage House
has a reputation

04:21.960 --> 04:25.200
for being
both quaint and creepy.

04:28.480 --> 04:32.080
Thanks in no small part to its
world famous collection

04:32.080 --> 04:38.080
of memorabilia, dedicated to
the great American writer,

04:38.080 --> 04:40.960
Edgar Allan Poe.

04:44.880 --> 04:47.760
"I knew that sound well, too.

04:47.760 --> 04:51.360
It was the beating
of the old man's heart.

04:51.360 --> 04:53.880
It increased my fury as
the beating of a drum

04:53.880 --> 04:57.160
stimulates the soldier
into courage."

04:57.160 --> 05:00.600
So wrote Edgar Allan Poe
in his seminal work,

05:00.600 --> 05:04.160
"The Tell-Tale Heart",
the original manuscript

05:04.160 --> 05:07.280
for which you can see
on display behind me.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.360
Don't touch that.

05:12.360 --> 05:15.400
It's very sharp.

05:15.400 --> 05:18.400
Now, where was I?

05:23.680 --> 05:26.360
Hey! That's my space.

05:26.360 --> 05:28.000
That's not very polite.

05:37.480 --> 05:39.120
Ladies.

05:42.720 --> 05:44.960
Would you mind
signing my petition?

05:44.960 --> 05:47.280
I'm trying to force the council
to reverse their decision

05:47.280 --> 05:49.040
to sell "The Tell-Tale Heart."

05:50.640 --> 05:53.960
You're wasting your time
with that dumb petition, Vicky.

05:53.960 --> 05:55.720
The auctioneers are coming
to collect

05:55.720 --> 05:58.920
"The Tell-Tale Heart" tomorrow
whether you like it or not.

05:58.920 --> 06:01.120
Not if I have anything to do
with it, they won't.

06:01.120 --> 06:02.960
It's time you faced reality.

06:02.960 --> 06:04.640
Heritage House is struggling.

06:04.640 --> 06:07.360
A slice of Poe memorabilia like
that's got to be worth

06:07.360 --> 06:09.240
half a million dollars.

06:09.240 --> 06:13.640
Without that money, this place
will close within a year.

06:13.640 --> 06:14.640
Philistine.

06:14.640 --> 06:16.240
Oh, who?

06:16.240 --> 06:17.920
- Jane.

06:17.920 --> 06:20.080
Professor Rhineheart,
that's who.

06:20.080 --> 06:21.920
<i>The</i> Professor Rhineheart?

06:21.920 --> 06:24.480
World famous author of
"Poe, The Man, The Enigma?"

06:24.480 --> 06:26.760
He's over here studying
"The Tell-Tale Heart"

06:26.760 --> 06:28.200
for the sequel.

06:28.200 --> 06:30.080
Don't tell me.
"Poe, The Man, the Enigma 2."

06:30.080 --> 06:32.280
I wish I could say
you were wrong.

06:32.280 --> 06:33.880
The man's an idiot.

06:33.880 --> 06:35.520
He's been flying around
the world

06:35.520 --> 06:38.240
researching his new book
for a decade.

06:38.240 --> 06:41.160
How he's got to where he is
is anyone's guess.

06:44.440 --> 06:46.680
Victoria Durrell, librarian.

06:46.680 --> 06:48.280
Beth Stone.

06:48.280 --> 06:51.480
Sorry I'm late, Victoria.
My alarm didn't go off.

06:51.480 --> 06:53.720
This is Oliver,
our new volunteer.

06:53.720 --> 06:55.920
Oliver, I need you
to show our guests

06:55.920 --> 06:58.000
to the recording booth.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.360
What? Oh.

07:00.360 --> 07:02.280
Yes, of course. Uh...

07:02.280 --> 07:04.360
Please, follow me.

07:06.280 --> 07:08.360
- Other way.
- Is it?

07:08.360 --> 07:11.480
Oh. Sorry.

07:11.480 --> 07:13.560
This way. Sorry.

07:16.600 --> 07:18.680
Here we are.

07:18.680 --> 07:20.880
Do you want me to show you
how to work the mixing desk?

07:20.880 --> 07:22.280
You know?

07:22.280 --> 07:25.080
I'm a retired civil servant
not a deejay.

07:25.080 --> 07:28.760
But, uh, I think
I can sort it out.

07:29.880 --> 07:31.480
Thanks.
We'll take it from here.

07:31.480 --> 07:32.920
Are you sure?

07:32.920 --> 07:35.400
Oh, well, let me know
if you need anything.

07:35.400 --> 07:36.840
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

07:36.840 --> 07:39.280
Bye.

07:39.280 --> 07:44.440
Right, I'll ready the props,
you cue up the recording.

07:44.440 --> 07:48.640
As Beth and Jane Stone
began work on Jane's audio book,

07:48.640 --> 07:52.760
precisely 2 miles,
304 yards away,

07:52.760 --> 07:55.920
PC Foster began to realize
that his chances

07:55.920 --> 07:58.600
of a romantic relationship
with Matilda

07:58.600 --> 08:02.000
were diminishing by the day.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.960
This was just delivered
to the front desk.

08:04.960 --> 08:07.360
For, although he had
long harbored feelings

08:07.360 --> 08:10.720
for Matilda,
it was clearer now...

08:10.720 --> 08:12.280
It's a present from George.

08:12.280 --> 08:14.200
...maybe
more than ever,

08:14.200 --> 08:17.120
that he had long
since missed the boat.

08:23.440 --> 08:25.480
Isn't it beautiful?

08:25.480 --> 08:27.360
Yes.

08:27.360 --> 08:29.640
Beautiful.

08:29.640 --> 08:34.880
"The Attenborough Equivalency",
by Jane Stone.

08:34.880 --> 08:36.320
Chapter one.

08:36.320 --> 08:39.280
The call came in at 2:00 a.m.

08:40.760 --> 08:43.280
Gunfire heard coming from
the Ferguson residence.

08:43.280 --> 08:45.840
Our Detective Inspector Lambert
and his partner

08:45.840 --> 08:48.520
D.S. Keegan were first
on the scene.

08:48.520 --> 08:50.200
- The sound of their feet

08:50.200 --> 08:51.920
on the gravel drive enough
to scare away the starlings...

08:51.920 --> 08:53.280
who had recently taken up

08:53.280 --> 08:56.080
-...residence on the lawn.

08:58.760 --> 09:01.200
"How do we know the caller's
telling the truth?

09:01.200 --> 09:04.200
This could be a setup,"
carped D.S. Keegan

09:04.200 --> 09:06.040
in his Highland drawl.

09:06.040 --> 09:07.520
Setup or not...

09:07.520 --> 09:09.120
-...Lambert knew that even

09:09.120 --> 09:11.400
the gravest of lies
hid an element of truth,

09:11.400 --> 09:14.280
and it was their job
to uncover it.

09:14.280 --> 09:16.320
Camera drones! Quick!

09:19.240 --> 09:20.920
Where's the umbrella
for the drones?

09:20.920 --> 09:22.440
Oh, I thought you packed it.

09:22.440 --> 09:23.800
There's probably one
in lost property.

09:23.800 --> 09:25.440
I'll go and ask.

09:28.560 --> 09:30.040
- Delivery.

09:30.040 --> 09:31.680
Oh, yeah, could you just
put them down there?

09:31.680 --> 09:33.520
Yeah. Sure.

09:35.480 --> 09:37.360
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

09:50.080 --> 09:51.320
Sorry.

09:51.320 --> 09:52.840
Uh, yeah, Karen was just, uh,

09:52.840 --> 09:55.160
helping me with the...

09:55.160 --> 09:56.480
If you say so.

09:57.920 --> 10:00.840
Uh, Robin Brunswick,
Heritage Director.

10:01.640 --> 10:03.280
Uh, this is Karen Freedman,

10:03.280 --> 10:07.280
our hygiene
maintenance coordinator.

10:07.280 --> 10:08.800
I'm the cleaner.

10:08.800 --> 10:10.920
- Beth Stone.
- Oh, the author? Yes.

10:10.920 --> 10:13.000
I heard a rumor you and your
sister would be in this week.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.720
Beth is Wildemarsh's
most famous resident author.

10:16.720 --> 10:19.240
Don't suppose you could
direct me to lost property.

10:19.240 --> 10:20.600
Oh, there's one
at the front desk.

10:20.600 --> 10:22.480
Thanks.
Nice to meet you both.

10:22.480 --> 10:26.600
We're having farewell drinks
later for "The Tell-Tale Heart."

10:26.600 --> 10:30.000
We'd be honored
if you'd join us.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.360
Poe room 5:00.

10:31.360 --> 10:33.760
Thanks.
I'll see you there.

10:33.760 --> 10:35.240
Yeah.

10:37.680 --> 10:40.000
I'm collecting names
to stop the council

10:40.000 --> 10:43.120
from selling off the town's
copy of "The Tell-Tale Heart."

10:43.120 --> 10:45.120
Oh, yeah. Sign me up.

10:53.480 --> 10:55.680
Here we go.

10:55.680 --> 10:58.680
Do you mind putting one of those
in the window in support?

10:58.680 --> 11:00.680
Sure.

11:00.680 --> 11:03.520
As well as collecting
names for her petition,

11:03.520 --> 11:08.600
librarian Victoria Durrell
also collected books,

11:08.600 --> 11:13.040
books that she didn't always
feel the need to pay for.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.680
- There we go.
- Thank you.

11:14.680 --> 11:17.200
- Bye bye.
- Okay, bye.

11:41.840 --> 11:44.560
If the arrival of
Daniel and Natasha's

11:44.560 --> 11:47.720
wedding invitation filled
Matilda with a torrent

11:47.720 --> 11:51.680
of emotions, the upcoming
departure of Heritage House's

11:51.680 --> 11:53.560
precious Poe manuscript

11:53.560 --> 11:58.200
was causing more than a trickle
of regret among its staff.

12:04.760 --> 12:09.040
I see your friend Victoria
is boycotting the proceedings.

12:09.040 --> 12:13.080
Sally Capstan, archivist,
tour guide, children's author.

12:13.080 --> 12:14.760
Victoria tells me you own
a bookshop.

12:14.760 --> 12:16.760
Murder Ink, on the high street.

12:16.760 --> 12:18.920
Then may I present you
with a complimentary copy

12:18.920 --> 12:22.800
of my debut novel,
"Poe, Poe, Poe Your Boat."

12:22.800 --> 12:25.320
It's a children's biography
of Edgar Allan Poe.

12:25.320 --> 12:29.080
I'm offering it to local
retailers at a discount.

12:29.080 --> 12:30.280
What's going on?

12:30.280 --> 12:33.160
Rob's about to give a speech.

12:33.160 --> 12:36.640
Henry, night security guard.

12:36.640 --> 12:40.400
Can I have everyone's
attention, please?

12:42.120 --> 12:45.000
Well, it's a sad day
for all of us, hm?

12:45.000 --> 12:48.520
Not only are we saying adiós
to our dear friend,

12:48.520 --> 12:53.880
Professor Rhineheart, but also
to our treasured Poe manuscript,

12:53.880 --> 12:56.680
"The Tell-Tale Heart."

12:56.680 --> 12:59.400
It's a great loss for all of us,
but a necessary one.

12:59.400 --> 13:04.080
And I'd like to add,
it's been an enormous privilege

13:04.080 --> 13:07.840
working with such esteemed
colleagues these past few weeks.

13:07.840 --> 13:10.440
So, as a token of my
appreciation,

13:10.440 --> 13:13.400
gifts for everyone.

13:13.400 --> 13:14.800
Ladies.

13:14.800 --> 13:16.440
Thank you.

13:17.880 --> 13:19.680
Henry.

13:19.680 --> 13:21.240
Cheers.

13:21.240 --> 13:24.480
And, yes, I have personally
signed every copy.

13:24.480 --> 13:26.880
- Oh.
- Meaning you can't exchange it.

13:26.880 --> 13:28.480
Right.
As I was saying,

13:28.480 --> 13:33.120
before Professor Rhineheart's
generous interruption,

13:33.120 --> 13:36.240
I have been reassured that
the money from the sale

13:36.240 --> 13:38.120
of the manuscript will
ensure our future

13:38.120 --> 13:39.920
for many years to come.

13:39.920 --> 13:43.120
So, with that in mind, I'd like
you all to raise your glasses,

13:43.120 --> 13:45.880
and I'd like to make a toast.

13:45.880 --> 13:49.680
To "The Tell-Tale Heart."

13:49.680 --> 13:51.960
-"The Tell-Tale Heart."
-"The Tell-Tale Heart."

13:57.920 --> 13:59.600
But I told you before, Mum,

13:59.600 --> 14:03.400
fish paste sandwiches and sushi
aren't the same thing.

14:07.440 --> 14:09.680
Well, yeah, it's made of fish.

14:09.680 --> 14:11.320
And yeah it's cold, but...

14:11.320 --> 14:14.360
All units, be on
the look out for a blue saloon.

14:14.360 --> 14:16.480
Driver reported to have
threatened a member

14:16.480 --> 14:18.720
of the public
with a baseball bat.

14:18.720 --> 14:21.680
Registration -- B700 VCS.

14:21.680 --> 14:23.440
Over.

14:24.240 --> 14:27.120
Mum, I've got to go.

14:27.120 --> 14:28.760
And thanks for the jelly pot.

14:35.400 --> 14:37.040
This is happening.

14:40.560 --> 14:42.040
Oi!

14:54.480 --> 14:55.720
Sir. Stop!

14:55.720 --> 14:57.640
Pull over!

15:07.040 --> 15:10.440
I hope you have probable cause
to stop me, officer.

15:10.440 --> 15:12.640
I was well within
the legal speed limit.

15:12.640 --> 15:15.600
Well, a man driving a car
matching this description

15:15.600 --> 15:17.800
was accused of threatening
a member of the public

15:17.800 --> 15:19.040
with a baseball bat.

15:19.040 --> 15:21.720
I don't even own a baseball bat.

15:26.240 --> 15:27.640
- What?
- I'm going to need you to

15:27.640 --> 15:28.720
accompany me to the station.

15:28.720 --> 15:29.960
No, you can't do this.

15:29.960 --> 15:31.200
Step out of the car,
please, sir.

15:31.200 --> 15:32.560
I have to be somewhere.

15:32.560 --> 15:34.240
P.C. Foster to base.
Suspect apprehended.

15:34.240 --> 15:35.840
- Backup requested.
- Alright, alright.

15:35.840 --> 15:37.760
No need for that.

15:37.760 --> 15:40.280
I'll come quietly.

15:42.680 --> 15:45.520
As Oliver McGorrie
prepared to face hours

15:45.520 --> 15:49.840
of scrutiny over his apparent
interest in baseball,

15:49.840 --> 15:53.200
Jane Stone was settling down
for some late night reading

15:53.200 --> 15:57.400
about an American obsession
of a more literary kind.

16:19.880 --> 16:21.560
Oh! You're in early.

16:21.560 --> 16:22.920
Oh, I didn't get a chance

16:22.920 --> 16:24.480
to clear up after
last night's drinks.

16:24.480 --> 16:25.720
Do you want a hand
with your bag?

16:25.720 --> 16:27.040
No, no! No, I'm fine.

16:27.040 --> 16:28.680
Thank you.

16:32.320 --> 16:33.880
Odd.

16:33.880 --> 16:36.680
The alarm should come on
when I open the door.

16:36.680 --> 16:39.200
I have to type in a key code
to make it stop.

16:39.200 --> 16:40.840
Look.

16:42.920 --> 16:46.480
I've got a bad feeling
about this.

16:46.480 --> 16:49.800
A turn up for the book
is an oft used phrase

16:49.800 --> 16:52.280
- to denote surprise.

16:52.280 --> 16:54.120
Henry?

16:54.120 --> 16:56.880
But in this instance,
it can also be taken literally.

16:56.880 --> 16:58.800
The manuscript.

16:59.880 --> 17:06.000
The item turning up
for the book, being...

17:06.000 --> 17:07.760
A solitary black feather.

17:11.480 --> 17:13.640
Thanks, Terry.
I'll meet you there.

17:13.640 --> 17:15.720
- Breakfast?
- I can't stay.

17:15.720 --> 17:17.680
There's been a break in
at Heritage House.

17:17.680 --> 17:20.080
Someone's stolen
"The Tell-Tale Heart."

17:22.640 --> 17:24.080
What?

17:24.080 --> 17:25.760
The manuscript was due
to be collected today

17:25.760 --> 17:26.920
by the auctioneers.

17:26.920 --> 17:29.160
- Coincidence?
- Maybe.

17:29.160 --> 17:31.720
But I'm more interested
in what the thief left behind.

17:31.720 --> 17:32.840
Which was what?

17:32.840 --> 17:34.800
A solitary black feather.

17:34.800 --> 17:37.480
Just like the one
in mum's safe deposit box.

17:37.480 --> 17:39.280
See you later.

17:39.280 --> 17:41.840
Although Matilda was
yet to appreciate

17:41.840 --> 17:45.800
the true significance
of the solitary black feather,

17:45.800 --> 17:48.480
her aunts couldn't help
but fear the truth

17:48.480 --> 17:52.280
was now closer to the surface
than at any time

17:52.280 --> 17:54.880
since her
mother's disappearance.

17:54.880 --> 17:56.520
We've got to get down there.

18:06.680 --> 18:08.920
I can't believe they're back.

18:08.920 --> 18:10.080
Who?

18:10.080 --> 18:12.400
The Raven.

18:12.400 --> 18:16.000
It was a cat burglar who
terrorized Wildemarsh for years.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.960
What makes you think
it's the same person?

18:17.960 --> 18:19.720
Well, there's a power cut
to the building,

18:19.720 --> 18:22.680
rope used to gain entry,
plus they used a solitary

18:22.680 --> 18:24.680
black feather
as a calling card.

18:24.680 --> 18:26.080
Were they ever caught?

18:26.080 --> 18:27.680
Not that I remember.

18:27.680 --> 18:30.120
Burglaries stopped.
They weren't heard from again.

18:30.120 --> 18:32.120
When was this?

18:32.120 --> 18:34.880
25 years ago.

18:34.880 --> 18:37.480
The same time,
thought Matilda,

18:37.480 --> 18:41.680
that her beloved mother,
Eleanor, went missing.

18:42.640 --> 18:45.080
Excuse me one moment.

18:45.080 --> 18:47.120
What are you doing here?

18:47.120 --> 18:49.280
Recording Jane's audio book.

18:49.280 --> 18:50.880
The why isn't Cat at the shop?

18:50.880 --> 18:53.480
Well, I was, um...

18:53.480 --> 18:55.880
giving Jane a hand.

18:55.880 --> 18:57.760
Wasn't I, Jane?

18:59.880 --> 19:01.880
Hm?

19:01.880 --> 19:04.280
Yes, whatever you say.

19:04.280 --> 19:06.480
In which case, I won't keep you.

19:11.120 --> 19:12.920
Oh.

19:12.920 --> 19:15.560
Can anyone else
hear an odd ticking?

19:26.280 --> 19:27.720
What if the Raven is back?

19:27.720 --> 19:29.440
- Impossible.
- I agree.

19:29.440 --> 19:31.600
The rope, the feather,
anyone could have staged that.

19:31.600 --> 19:33.120
Well, how do we
tell Matilda that?

19:33.120 --> 19:34.880
There's only one way.

19:34.880 --> 19:39.000
We have to find out who really
stole that manuscript.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.600
The security office will have
a plan of the building.

19:41.600 --> 19:43.480
I want to see how else
the thief could have got in.

19:43.480 --> 19:45.160
Come on.

19:47.640 --> 19:51.240
Alright mate.
Can you remember your name?

19:51.240 --> 19:53.360
Do you remember what happened?

19:57.640 --> 19:59.080
What's going on?

19:59.080 --> 20:00.680
Oh.

20:00.680 --> 20:03.480
Someone beat Henry up last night
and stole the manuscript.

20:03.480 --> 20:05.480
Damn police!

20:09.840 --> 20:11.400
- Anything?
- Clean.

20:11.400 --> 20:13.240
Same as the display case.

20:13.240 --> 20:14.520
Power supply to the building?

20:14.520 --> 20:17.600
As you suspected,
cut to disable the alarm.

20:17.600 --> 20:19.240
It's all very professional.

20:21.280 --> 20:24.800
Sarge, see that man down there?

20:24.800 --> 20:27.280
I arrested him
yesterday evening.

20:27.280 --> 20:29.480
A member of public rang in to
say that he threatened them

20:29.480 --> 20:30.640
with a baseball bat.

20:30.640 --> 20:32.400
Did you charge him?

20:32.400 --> 20:34.720
I found a bat in his car, but
we couldn't trace the caller.

20:34.720 --> 20:36.480
We had to release him
in the end.

20:36.480 --> 20:37.880
What time was this?

20:37.880 --> 20:39.960
I took him down the station
around 7:00.

20:39.960 --> 20:42.960
Custody sergeant was forced
to release him around 1:00 a.m.

20:46.480 --> 20:49.240
Oh, it has
to be here somewhere.

20:49.240 --> 20:51.200
He's got a camp bed in here.

20:51.200 --> 20:53.920
Looks like someone
enjoys sleeping on the job.

20:53.920 --> 20:57.080
What's his name again?
I'm sure I've seen him before.

20:57.080 --> 20:58.640
Henry Wade.

20:58.640 --> 21:00.360
Henry Wade?

21:01.840 --> 21:04.400
Jane, are you okay?
You don't seem yourself.

21:04.400 --> 21:08.520
Mm. Ever since we got here this
morning, I've felt really odd.

21:08.520 --> 21:09.680
I'm saying nothing.

21:09.680 --> 21:12.080
Oh, no, not my usual odd.

21:12.080 --> 21:14.840
This is like an itch
I can't scratch.

21:14.840 --> 21:17.600
- Right, found it.
- Oh.

21:21.440 --> 21:24.080
This doesn't make sense.

21:24.080 --> 21:25.560
If the power to the alarm
was disconnected,

21:25.560 --> 21:27.280
why come in the skylight?

21:27.280 --> 21:29.760
I mean, breaking in through
the rear doors

21:29.760 --> 21:31.200
would have been much easier.

21:31.200 --> 21:33.560
Plus, the real Raven
only used the skylight

21:33.560 --> 21:35.280
when there was no alternative.

21:35.280 --> 21:37.960
What do you think, Jane?

21:37.960 --> 21:40.760
Jane?

21:40.760 --> 21:43.200
Look out below.

21:45.520 --> 21:47.640
I was monitoring the cameras
in the office

21:47.640 --> 21:48.760
when the power went out.

21:48.760 --> 21:49.880
What time was that?

21:49.880 --> 21:51.440
Around 9:30.

21:51.440 --> 21:53.280
Did the rounds.

21:53.280 --> 21:55.280
Everything looked fine.

21:55.280 --> 21:57.400
Then I heard a noise,
and before I knew what happened

21:57.400 --> 21:58.960
someone hit me over the head.

21:58.960 --> 22:00.440
Did you get a look
at who did it?

22:00.440 --> 22:02.880
No.
It all happened so fast.

22:05.160 --> 22:07.680
By the time I came round,
it was the morning

22:07.680 --> 22:10.240
and I was bound and gagged.

22:11.960 --> 22:13.280
Sorry.

22:15.480 --> 22:16.880
I really need to get this.

22:16.880 --> 22:18.520
Yeah.

22:18.520 --> 22:20.480
Yes?

22:20.480 --> 22:23.120
No, I'm stuck at work.

22:23.120 --> 22:25.200
No, I'm fine.

22:25.200 --> 22:26.720
Take your sister to school
for me.

22:26.720 --> 22:29.480
There's some money
in the kitchen jar for lunch.

22:29.480 --> 22:32.120
No.
Nothing to worry about.

22:32.120 --> 22:34.000
Love you.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.480
Everything okay?

22:35.480 --> 22:37.160
Yeah.

22:37.160 --> 22:38.720
My eldest.

22:38.720 --> 22:42.200
Since Alison left,
it's just been me and the kids.

22:42.200 --> 22:43.680
You keep yawning.

22:43.680 --> 22:45.120
I'm on it.

22:45.120 --> 22:48.160
I'm taking him to hospital
for a scan.

22:48.160 --> 22:50.640
Can never be too careful
with concussion.

22:50.640 --> 22:52.080
In you pop.

22:52.080 --> 22:53.600
Really? I'm fine.

22:53.600 --> 22:55.240
It's not a request.

23:00.040 --> 23:01.680
Let me help.

23:01.680 --> 23:03.320
Hands and feet.

23:05.800 --> 23:07.760
I'll see you around, Sergeant.

23:09.400 --> 23:11.800
Don't worry, we'll have you home
by lunchtime.

23:15.880 --> 23:18.880
It's all so upsetting.

23:18.880 --> 23:20.600
I'm going to need
you to do a stock-take

23:20.600 --> 23:24.000
to make sure no more books
or other items have been taken.

23:24.000 --> 23:27.480
But that could take weeks.

23:27.480 --> 23:30.840
We haven't done an audit
in years.

23:30.840 --> 23:32.320
I'm sorry, Sergeant.

23:32.320 --> 23:33.960
I thought you ought to know
that the professor

23:33.960 --> 23:35.640
didn't turn up this morning.

23:35.640 --> 23:36.800
Who?

23:36.800 --> 23:38.240
Professor Rhineheart.

23:38.240 --> 23:40.120
Horrible, Ivy League
know it all.

23:40.120 --> 23:41.720
I rang the hotel.

23:41.720 --> 23:44.360
They said he went out last night
but he never returned.

23:44.360 --> 23:45.800
Sarge?

23:45.800 --> 23:48.320
There's something wrong
with your Aunt Jane.

23:50.160 --> 23:52.080
Will you please
keep still and listen?

23:52.080 --> 23:56.080
I can hear something,
so everyone be quiet.

23:58.320 --> 24:00.000
Listen.

24:07.320 --> 24:09.760
Something is not right.

24:09.760 --> 24:12.440
Why can't any of you hear it?

24:12.440 --> 24:14.640
- What's she talking about?
- Oh, don't ask.

24:14.640 --> 24:16.000
She's been like this
all morning.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.400
Shouldn't we do something?

24:17.400 --> 24:18.880
We've always found it best
to let her work

24:18.880 --> 24:21.120
these things out for herself.

24:31.040 --> 24:33.680
I knew something wasn't right.

24:35.240 --> 24:37.240
Despite her
Aunt Jane's relief

24:37.240 --> 24:40.880
at discovering the source
of her audible anomaly,

24:40.880 --> 24:44.720
it was the health and welfare
of the pocket watch's owner

24:44.720 --> 24:47.680
that was uppermost
Matilda's thoughts.

24:49.960 --> 24:52.480
Oh.

24:52.480 --> 24:55.120
Professor Rhineheart?

25:23.480 --> 25:25.160
What have we got?

25:25.160 --> 25:28.200
Professor Titus Rhineheart,
visiting American academic.

25:28.200 --> 25:30.120
He was here researching
the stolen manuscript

25:30.120 --> 25:31.760
for his latest book.

25:31.760 --> 25:33.360
Cause of death?

25:33.360 --> 25:35.840
Appears to be a form of blunt
force trauma to the head.

25:39.800 --> 25:41.960
Natasha?

25:41.960 --> 25:44.600
Wedding list? What color?

25:44.600 --> 25:45.760
Uh, the red ones?

25:45.760 --> 25:48.280
No?
Okay, you choose.

25:48.280 --> 25:50.800
I <i>am</i> trying to be helpful.

25:52.120 --> 25:55.600
What did Oliver McGorrie say he
did before he volunteered here?

25:55.600 --> 25:57.840
Civil servant. Why?

25:57.840 --> 26:00.560
Either of you notice
how he and Inspector Thorne

26:00.560 --> 26:02.920
share the same body language?

26:06.440 --> 26:08.200
Why are your aunts here, Stone?

26:08.200 --> 26:10.080
Recording an audio book, sir.

26:10.080 --> 26:11.600
Aunt Jane's the one
who found the body.

26:11.600 --> 26:13.280
Oh. Course she did.

26:13.280 --> 26:15.160
I love you, too.

26:16.800 --> 26:18.520
Sorry.

26:20.560 --> 26:21.880
Sorry about that.

26:21.880 --> 26:23.840
Putting the body inside
the clock

26:23.840 --> 26:25.960
prevented the pendulum
from swinging.

26:25.960 --> 26:28.040
I take it that is
the time of death?

26:28.040 --> 26:29.320
Yes.

26:29.320 --> 26:30.560
I'd say death occurred
somewhere between

26:30.560 --> 26:31.720
9:00 p.m. and midnight.

26:31.720 --> 26:33.600
Same time as the break-in?

26:33.600 --> 26:35.800
What was the victim doing here
that time of night?

26:35.800 --> 26:37.480
Robin Brunswick,
Heritage Director,

26:37.480 --> 26:39.520
gave him special permission
to stay late.

26:39.520 --> 26:43.080
So, thief breaks in, discovers
Rhineheart's still here,

26:43.080 --> 26:45.320
fight breaks out,
thief kills Rhineheart,

26:45.320 --> 26:46.480
and makes off
with the manuscript.

26:46.480 --> 26:48.400
That's the working
hypothesis, sir.

26:48.400 --> 26:50.520
I want all the staff
re-interviewed, and timelines

26:50.520 --> 26:52.600
established for everyone's
whereabouts last night.

26:52.600 --> 26:54.160
Sir.

26:57.640 --> 26:58.600
Natasha?

26:58.600 --> 26:59.920
Table decorations?

27:01.360 --> 27:04.200
No, I haven't
rung the florist yet.

27:04.200 --> 27:05.880
Uh, you choose.

27:05.880 --> 27:07.440
I <i>am</i> trying to be helpful.

27:09.120 --> 27:10.760
Nightmare.

27:20.440 --> 27:22.080
I'll meet you back
at the recording booth.

27:22.080 --> 27:23.800
Why, where are you going?

27:23.800 --> 27:26.000
To do some digging
on Henry Wade.

27:29.560 --> 27:32.520
Sir, have you ever heard
of the Raven?

27:32.520 --> 27:34.280
The poem by Edgar Allan Poe?

27:34.280 --> 27:37.520
The house thief who operated
around Wildemarsh 25 years ago.

27:37.520 --> 27:40.240
Part of their M.O. was to leave
behind a solitary black feather

27:40.240 --> 27:41.520
at the scene of a crime.

27:41.520 --> 27:43.480
25 years is a lifetime ago,
Sergeant.

27:43.480 --> 27:46.880
I was going to ask P.C. Foster
to dig out the old police files.

27:46.880 --> 27:50.200
I can, uh...
I can do that if you like.

27:50.200 --> 27:51.840
Thank you, sir.

27:58.200 --> 28:00.360
We better at least make it look
like we're working.

28:00.360 --> 28:01.960
I'll set up the deck,
you make the coffee.

28:01.960 --> 28:04.600
Mm-hmm.

28:04.600 --> 28:06.120
What have you got there?

28:06.120 --> 28:09.920
The cleaner, Karen.
She's left this card behind.

28:09.920 --> 28:11.720
Oh, we're out of coffee.

28:11.720 --> 28:14.520
But I saw some
in the security office.

28:14.520 --> 28:16.080
Back in a sec.

28:16.080 --> 28:18.680
As Beth Stone
reflected on Karen's

28:18.680 --> 28:21.080
carelessness in leaving such
a secret letter

28:21.080 --> 28:24.760
of affection unguarded,
Cat Stone was about

28:24.760 --> 28:28.280
to uncover Henry Wade's
most carefully guarded secret.

28:28.280 --> 28:30.160
I'm looking for Henry Wade.

28:30.160 --> 28:31.480
You from the social?

28:31.480 --> 28:32.800
Kylie,
give me my dolly back.

28:32.800 --> 28:34.080
Kylie, give Britney
her dolly back.

28:34.080 --> 28:35.840
I won't tell you again.

28:35.840 --> 28:37.400
Who is it you're
looking for again?

28:37.400 --> 28:38.880
Henry Wade.

28:38.880 --> 28:40.520
Never heard of him.

28:52.880 --> 28:57.120
Yeah. Hi. I'd like to organize
a return on an order.

28:57.800 --> 28:59.440
Got it!

29:04.400 --> 29:06.440
And while Jane Stone
was considering

29:06.440 --> 29:09.960
the unusual aroma of the coffee
she had borrowed

29:09.960 --> 29:15.560
from Henry Wade's office,
2 miles, 427 yards away,

29:15.560 --> 29:19.520
Inspector Thorne was praying
that Matilda didn't smell a rat.

29:19.520 --> 29:21.080
A burst water pipe?

29:21.080 --> 29:23.280
Borough HQ said it happened
a few years ago.

29:23.280 --> 29:24.800
Destroyed hundreds of old files,

29:24.800 --> 29:27.760
including everything on
your so-called Raven.

29:27.760 --> 29:29.400
- Oh.

29:29.400 --> 29:32.680
Yes. Very unfortunate,
but nothing we can do about it.

29:32.680 --> 29:35.560
Best let it lie.

29:35.560 --> 29:38.240
There's a Karen Freedman
in reception.

29:38.240 --> 29:40.360
Says it's urgent.

29:45.680 --> 29:48.440
Karen, how can I help?

29:48.440 --> 29:50.120
I should have said
something earlier.

29:50.120 --> 29:52.200
I didn't want to say anything
in front of the others.

29:52.200 --> 29:54.280
Go on.

29:54.280 --> 29:56.800
I'm out on license.

29:56.800 --> 29:58.320
I was recently released
from prison

29:58.320 --> 30:01.880
after serving 10 years
for killing my husband.

30:01.880 --> 30:03.880
Oh, well, thank you
for letting me know.

30:03.880 --> 30:05.640
No, you don't understand.

30:05.640 --> 30:08.120
I didn't just kill my husband.
I killed Professor Rhineheart.

30:08.120 --> 30:10.560
She's lying.

30:10.560 --> 30:13.360
I know because I killed
Professor Rhineheart.

30:21.880 --> 30:24.000
You haven't seen Karen
about, have you?

30:24.000 --> 30:25.520
I've been looking everywhere.

30:26.840 --> 30:28.920
What?

30:28.920 --> 30:31.080
Robin and Karen have
both confessed

30:31.080 --> 30:33.120
to being
Rhineheart's killer.

30:33.120 --> 30:35.120
- Together?
- Separately.

30:35.120 --> 30:37.280
They each rang to say they were
going to the police station

30:37.280 --> 30:38.920
to confess.

30:41.160 --> 30:43.480
Tell me what happened
last night.

30:45.000 --> 30:47.920
It was around half 9:00.

30:47.920 --> 30:52.040
I was just finishing up
when the lights went out.

30:52.040 --> 30:56.280
I thought I heard Henry,
the security guard,

30:56.280 --> 30:59.920
in the Poe room,
so I went to find him.

30:59.920 --> 31:02.480
That's when I saw the first
of two masked men.

31:02.480 --> 31:04.400
<i>Two</i> masked men?

31:04.400 --> 31:06.080
Well, I grabbed one,

31:06.080 --> 31:09.840
but the other escaped up
the rope with the manuscript.

31:09.840 --> 31:11.640
Then what happened?

31:11.640 --> 31:13.680
He was stronger than I thought.
I guess I must have panicked.

31:13.680 --> 31:15.360
I grabbed a metal candlestick,

31:15.360 --> 31:19.520
and I hit him
over the head...hard.

31:20.920 --> 31:23.160
I picked up a bronze bust
of Edgar Allan Poe,

31:23.160 --> 31:24.840
and I cracked it
over his head.

31:27.480 --> 31:30.400
I knew straightaway
I'd killed him.

31:30.400 --> 31:33.680
Did you know it was
Professor Rhineheart?

31:33.680 --> 31:36.520
Not until
I took off his mask.

31:37.760 --> 31:40.640
When I saw who it was,
I panicked.

31:40.640 --> 31:45.840
I hid him in the grandfather
clock, and I went home.

31:45.840 --> 31:47.960
So, why confess now?

31:47.960 --> 31:52.280
I thought I could live with
what I'd done, but I can't.

31:52.280 --> 31:54.680
So, why confess now?

31:54.680 --> 31:56.320
With my record,

31:56.320 --> 31:58.720
I knew you'd figure
it was me sooner or later.

32:04.800 --> 32:07.280
So, which one of them
do you believe?

32:07.280 --> 32:08.480
Neither confession seemed

32:08.480 --> 32:10.280
very convincing to me, sir.

32:10.280 --> 32:13.480
One thing's for sure, they can't
both be telling the truth.

32:13.480 --> 32:15.080
What if neither of them are?

32:15.080 --> 32:16.960
- What are you doing back here?
- Sorry, sir.

32:16.960 --> 32:19.000
She sort of slipped past
when I wasn't looking.

32:19.000 --> 32:20.560
This had better be important.

32:20.560 --> 32:23.440
I found a card to Karen Freedman
from Robin Brunswick.

32:26.800 --> 32:30.320
"To my darling Karen, you once
said you'd do anything for me.

32:30.320 --> 32:32.760
Believe me when I say
I would do the same.

32:32.760 --> 32:34.400
Love you always, Rob."

32:34.400 --> 32:36.400
You're suggesting they both
mistakenly think the other

32:36.400 --> 32:37.960
murdered Professor Rhineheart

32:37.960 --> 32:39.680
and they're trying to
take the rap for each other?

32:39.680 --> 32:41.400
It's a possibility.

32:46.520 --> 32:48.120
Dr. Lynch?

32:48.120 --> 32:51.960
Matilda? I was
hoping you'd ring.

32:51.960 --> 32:53.840
Professor Rhineheart's
post-mortem,

32:53.840 --> 32:55.520
have you completed it yet?

32:55.520 --> 32:58.840
Uh, yes.
I'm typing up my notes now.

32:58.840 --> 33:01.520
What can you tell me about
the head wound?

33:01.520 --> 33:04.760
The fatal blow was to
the base of the victim's skull,

33:04.760 --> 33:06.560
caused by an upward impact

33:06.560 --> 33:09.440
with a sharp angled
three sided object.

33:09.440 --> 33:11.680
So, not by someone
hitting them over the head?

33:11.680 --> 33:14.000
No. I'd say the victim
almost certainly fell backwards

33:14.000 --> 33:15.920
on to the corner
of the display case.

33:15.920 --> 33:17.840
So they are both lying.

33:17.840 --> 33:18.800
Thanks.

33:24.600 --> 33:27.160
As she waited for
her sister's return,

33:27.160 --> 33:31.000
Jane Stone couldn't help
but compare the dense prose

33:31.000 --> 33:34.440
of Professor Rhineheart's
famous Poe biography

33:34.440 --> 33:35.880
with the rhyming couplets of

33:35.880 --> 33:39.040
Sally Capstan's
lesser known work.

33:39.040 --> 33:41.280
Never, she thought,
had two authors

33:41.280 --> 33:45.120
taken such different approaches
to the same subject.

33:47.280 --> 33:50.320
Although, reading
Sally Capstan's biog,

33:50.320 --> 33:54.480
she noted how the pair had
at least one thing in common.

33:54.480 --> 33:56.520
One very important thing

33:56.520 --> 33:59.360
that neither had
sought to mention.

33:59.360 --> 34:01.160
Curious.

34:02.960 --> 34:05.320
Why didn't you tell anyone that
you and Professor Rhineheart

34:05.320 --> 34:06.800
knew each other?

34:06.800 --> 34:08.920
We...didn't.

34:08.920 --> 34:11.080
Not before this week.

34:11.080 --> 34:13.200
You interned at
Hargreaves Auction House

34:13.200 --> 34:15.960
in New York at the same time as
the Professor worked there

34:15.960 --> 34:17.480
consulting on rare books.

34:17.480 --> 34:19.800
It's complicated.

34:22.040 --> 34:23.560
I shouldn't be telling you this.

34:23.560 --> 34:25.280
Because it'll incriminate you?

34:25.280 --> 34:29.680
Because I signed
a non-disclosure agreement.

34:29.680 --> 34:33.640
Before I went to uni, I interned
at Hargreaves for the summer.

34:33.640 --> 34:35.760
I'm so sorry. Do go on.

34:35.760 --> 34:38.760
I was assigned to assist
Professor Rhineheart.

34:38.760 --> 34:40.760
I was archiving records
of a private sale

34:40.760 --> 34:44.640
of a rare 1840 reprint
of Poe's first work,

34:44.640 --> 34:47.000
"Tamerlane and Other Poems."

34:47.000 --> 34:50.000
The book was verified as being
authentic by the professor,

34:50.000 --> 34:52.200
but I knew for a fact
"Tamerlane and Other Poems"

34:52.200 --> 34:55.720
had never been republished
during Poe's lifetime.

34:55.720 --> 34:58.080
The auction house sold a fake.

34:58.080 --> 35:00.400
- Did you report it?
- Straight away.

35:00.400 --> 35:03.600
But Rhineheart and the auction
house wanted it all kept quiet.

35:03.600 --> 35:05.320
They made me sign an NDA.

35:05.320 --> 35:07.560
Said if I uttered
a word, they'd sue.

35:07.560 --> 35:09.920
I didn't like the professor,
but I swear,

35:09.920 --> 35:12.320
I had nothing to do
with his death.

35:31.640 --> 35:33.440
Karen!

35:33.440 --> 35:34.920
Rob?

35:36.680 --> 35:38.280
I went to the restaurant,
and you weren't there,

35:38.280 --> 35:39.960
and then I heard
about the murder and --

35:39.960 --> 35:41.720
The restaurant?
I went to the pub.

35:41.720 --> 35:44.120
And when you didn't turn up
and I learned about the murder,

35:44.120 --> 35:45.400
I thought that --

35:45.400 --> 35:47.360
It's all right.
It's over now.

35:47.360 --> 35:50.080
You're lucky I don't book you
both for wasting police time.

35:50.080 --> 35:52.040
We're sorry, Inspector.

35:52.040 --> 35:56.200
What Inspector Thorne
wanted to say next was...

35:56.200 --> 36:00.440
How I envy you both, the bravery
to embrace true love,

36:00.440 --> 36:03.320
to take that first leap
into the unknown,

36:03.320 --> 36:06.240
to say to another,
"I love you."

36:06.240 --> 36:08.360
To say those words out loud
and mean them,

36:08.360 --> 36:11.840
without care
of rejection or ridicule.

36:11.840 --> 36:14.560
I fear my heart's
not that strong.

36:14.560 --> 36:17.480
I fear those words of love
once spoken,

36:17.480 --> 36:21.720
if not returned in kind,
would be my last.

36:21.720 --> 36:23.960
But what
he chose to say was...

36:23.960 --> 36:27.640
Clear off, the pair of you,
before I change my mind.

36:27.640 --> 36:30.280
While Karen Freedman
and Robin Brunswick's

36:30.280 --> 36:33.880
confessions had failed to shine
a light on who really did kill

36:33.880 --> 36:38.240
Professor Rhineheart,
tour guide Sally Capstan

36:38.240 --> 36:41.400
had lit upon evidence
she hoped would be of a more

36:41.400 --> 36:44.480
financially beneficial kind.

36:44.480 --> 36:47.280
Yes, I've got the proof.

36:47.280 --> 36:49.880
It's going to cost you.

36:49.880 --> 36:52.520
Meet me in the Embittered Hack
in half an hour.

36:57.680 --> 36:59.560
Evening, Aunt Jane.

36:59.560 --> 37:01.000
Hm?

37:01.000 --> 37:03.240
Oh! evening, Matty.

37:04.240 --> 37:06.280
You ever heard stories
of a local cat burglar

37:06.280 --> 37:09.120
known as the Raven?

37:09.120 --> 37:12.560
Well, I can't say that I have.

37:15.520 --> 37:20.080
You need to speak to
Sally Capstan.

37:23.600 --> 37:25.640
She worked at
Hargreaves, New York?

37:25.640 --> 37:28.560
She interned for
Professor Rhineheart.

37:29.520 --> 37:33.240
It's odd that she never
mentioned it.

37:34.480 --> 37:36.600
Are you okay? You keep yawning.

37:36.600 --> 37:39.520
I am really tired
for some reason.

37:39.520 --> 37:42.760
I'm going to get an early night.

37:43.280 --> 37:44.440
Night.

37:44.440 --> 37:46.400
Night, Aunt Jane.

37:48.200 --> 37:51.520
Despite Matilda having
spent many happy hours

37:51.520 --> 37:54.600
curled up in a corner
of her Aunt Jane's bookshop,

37:54.600 --> 37:57.640
devouring the myriad of
crime fiction novels

37:57.640 --> 38:01.200
that lined the shops
aging shelves...

38:03.880 --> 38:09.480
...a real life murder had never
darkened the shop's door...

38:09.480 --> 38:11.280
until now.

38:30.760 --> 38:34.680
I swear I had nothing
to do with his death.

38:38.160 --> 38:40.560
Professor Rhineheart?

38:54.200 --> 38:55.840
Hello?

39:02.600 --> 39:04.240
Sally?

39:27.760 --> 39:30.120
What's all the noise?
