Lester:
Tell that to Darwin.

11:12.877 --> 11:15.077
Virginia: No, our research has
shown from the very beginning

11:15.129 --> 11:17.162
that women are just as capable
as men are

in purely physical terms.

William: Would you excuse us,
please, Lester?

that you agree with him.

11:29.410 --> 11:31.977
William: You are
absolutely right, Virginia.

11:32.013 --> 11:33.846
This is why I need you involved
in this work.

11:33.898 --> 11:37.016
The problem isn't the women.
The problem is the protocol.

11:37.068 --> 11:39.318
The lack of a protocol
for male surrogates to use

11:39.353 --> 11:41.353
- in addressing dyspareunia.
- Virginia: Exactly.

11:41.355 --> 11:42.821
William:
Lester isn't succeeding

11:42.857 --> 11:49.198
because I didn't give him
the proper road map.

11:49.250 --> 11:51.167
Lliam: And quickly.

11:51.202 --> 11:53.098
Virginia: We need to observe
more cases, compile more data...

11:53.218 --> 11:55.384
William: Or we could solve
the problem ourselves,

11:58.468 --> 12:01.094
That's the way we've developed
every other procedure.

Together,
testing it on ourselves.

Why -- why wouldn't we do
the same thing now?

12:09.689 --> 12:11.522

12:11.558 --> 12:13.724

our patients first,

like Miss Weiland.

all the way up till practice.

the babysitter, then.

You should take advantage.

You got the afternoon off
with no kids.

13:10.613 --> 13:12.580
You should treat yourself
to lunch or something.

on Davenport.

Ronald: Do you know where
the word "holy" comes from?

54:39.798 --> 54:45.635
It comes from the Greek,
"hagios," meaning separate.

54:45.670 --> 54:50.106
So when God tells us he longs
for us to be a holy people,

54:50.141 --> 54:52.475
what he means is literally
at a distance.

we take away that distance,
