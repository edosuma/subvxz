01:14.333 --> 01:15.939
How come your doctor
back home allowed

01:16.135 --> 01:18.276
so much time after the first surgery!

01:18.471 --> 01:20.077
No, I just felt that...

01:20.239 --> 01:22.916
it would be too painful to go
through another operation back then.

01:24.678 --> 01:25.783
Keep your head straight, child.

01:26.045 --> 01:26.820
You mean emotionally'!

01:27.014 --> 01:27.321
Yeah.

01:27.514 --> 01:30.225
Besides it's also rare fol people
to donate eyes back home.

01:31.318 --> 01:32.525
Religious prejudice?

01:48.403 --> 01:49.884
Is this the coughing man!

02:01.718 --> 02:03.198
Are you going to do anything about it!

02:03.886 --> 02:04.729
Yeah.

02:14.731 --> 02:15.574
What are you doing!

02:19.637 --> 02:20.446
That looks nice.

02:20.738 --> 02:22.082
But which one do you like better!

02:22.272 --> 02:23.412
This one or...
- Edit

02:24.942 --> 02:26.218
Undo
- this one'!

02:27.578 --> 02:28.557
Show me again.

02:28.947 --> 02:29.721
Edit

02:31.382 --> 02:32.054
Redo

02:32.450 --> 02:34.227
Hmm... that looks better.

02:35.587 --> 02:36.726
Do you want the background so dark?

02:37.389 --> 02:38.266
Yeah.

03:04.250 --> 03:08.761
Maysoon said you've been
featured in today's Al Halam.

03:09.156 --> 03:11.297
Yeah, they did a phone interview.

03:12.293 --> 03:14.002
I am so excited!
I wish I could be present.

03:14.195 --> 03:16.575
I'll send you pictures and
videos from the exhibition.

03:18.265 --> 03:21.876
Is he coming!
- ls who coming!

03:23.170 --> 03:25.551
Of course, he is!
Mom, come on!

03:27.342 --> 03:28.686
I won't put my
bets on a man...

03:28.877 --> 03:32.521
who lives in the same city as his daughter
and sees her ten times in two years!

03:32.715 --> 03:34.697
You say these things about
each other...

03:34.883 --> 03:37.389
and then behave like
everything is normal...

03:37.620 --> 03:40.103
laughing and bitching
like teenagers!

03:42.691 --> 03:45.675
That's a healthy romantic idea
you have about your parents.

03:46.529 --> 03:49.376
Vinay, hello deal!
- Hi Hala!

03:50.299 --> 03:51.005
How ale you!

03:52.369 --> 03:54.248
I'm Okay. I'm Okay.

03:56.173 --> 03:59.714
Is grunge in again?
- Grunge! Well, I'm just lazy.

03:59.910 --> 04:03.794
You never sent me the animation you made.
- Oh, I'll send it to you... very soon.

04:04.549 --> 04:08.330
And have you recorded any new songs!
- Yeah, we did. I'll send them across too.

04:09.687 --> 04:15.166
And how is your Arabic?
- Pink. Fantastic. What-the-hell!

04:16.327 --> 04:17.603
I'm working on it.

05:24.967 --> 05:25.970
How is your mother!

05:26.502 --> 05:28.211
She is very good.
She sends her regards.

05:29.472 --> 05:30.611
Uncle, what are these?

05:31.608 --> 05:35.115
Those are bamboos.
They hold the building together.

05:35.846 --> 05:38.159
They are holding the building together!
- Yeah.

05:38.615 --> 05:39.617
How come!

05:47.091 --> 05:49.802
Bright orange. Deep yellow.

05:51.363 --> 05:52.240
Bright orange

06:05.010 --> 06:05.785
Red.

06:06.979 --> 06:07.651
What!

06:08.981 --> 06:10.758
I was just seeing where you ale.

06:12.685 --> 06:13.630
Red.

06:15.054 --> 06:16.329
Aunty, is this glass?

06:16.790 --> 06:17.565
YES-

06:18.558 --> 06:19.833
I'll close it for a second okay!

08:22.257 --> 08:25.434
And ljust hung around in their house
and explored the spaces...

08:25.627 --> 08:28.008
and I let them just be
as they were and...

08:28.596 --> 08:31.740
then I was really intrigued by the kid.
He was really friendly and...

08:32.134 --> 08:35.847
ljust kept following him and that's when
one of those pictures was clicked.

08:36.205 --> 08:39.553
So, you mentioned in your website
that you actually took up photography...

08:39.775 --> 08:44.058
after you lost your eyesight to
a cornea infection. -Yeah, true.

08:44.280 --> 08:45.089
Why photography!

08:46.950 --> 08:49.159
Well, first to document,
archive, and remember.

08:49.519 --> 08:52.366
Then, to kind of... explore,
understand and see.

08:53.157 --> 08:55.639
So, I guess all art evolves from
a need to record the apparent...

08:55.825 --> 08:57.135
to a need to capture the essence!

08:57.394 --> 09:00.777
That's very well put. I mean that's
exactly how it's been for me.

09:01.832 --> 09:03.541
When I first started
taking pictures...

09:03.734 --> 09:07.082
I was very much amused by the character
of the perfumer in Suskind's novel.

09:07.872 --> 09:11.153
Just the idea of a man trying
to capture every scent...

09:11.742 --> 09:14.453
starting from people to
surroundings to experiences.

09:14.680 --> 09:16.160
You know, it was very
much amusing.

09:16.982 --> 09:18.986
That's a very
interesting analogy.

09:19.818 --> 09:20.820
Why black and white!

09:21.520 --> 09:24.231
Itjust gives me more control
over the elements of my pictures.

09:24.423 --> 09:26.564
But do you ever feel
limited by anything!

09:27.659 --> 09:29.538
<i>“Mm... No'.!</i>

09:30.429 --> 09:31.774
That's... that's amazing.

09:33.900 --> 09:39.413
Is it! I mean... why is it so amazing
to not have limits or doubts!

09:41.708 --> 09:44.716
Honestly, I just can't wait to begin
my life as a photographer.

09:45.078 --> 09:49.258
But you are a photographer...
I mean, you're a good photographer!

10:07.035 --> 10:07.844
Hello!

10:10.239 --> 10:10.945
<i>/I/</i>

10:11.140 --> 10:13.179
ls that your house!
- Yes!

10:13.976 --> 10:16.823
So, I heal ducks, and lots of
animals. Are they inside!

10:17.079 --> 10:17.922
YES-

10:42.639 --> 10:43.243
Orlando! Ale you ready?

10:43.440 --> 10:43.976
Yeah.

10:44.175 --> 10:45.952
Aunty, can you start splashing!

10:51.349 --> 10:53.992
I will take the pictures from there,
okay!

10:54.319 --> 10:57.964
And I just want you to splash
the water on this side.

11:06.799 --> 11:08.474
Yeah, this one is quite an image.

11:09.002 --> 11:12.214
Alright, there's a very
small pond at the bottom.

11:13.372 --> 11:14.374
And...

11:15.008 --> 11:18.151
there ale foul ducks swimming
in foul opposite directions.

11:19.446 --> 11:23.330
And the one in the center is frozen in
the middle of its ﬂapping of the wings.

11:23.951 --> 11:26.764
There's one sitting at the some!
of the pond, away from us.

11:27.054 --> 11:28.500
It's wet.

11:29.289 --> 11:31.396
And there's one ﬂying in m
the flame from the light,

11:31.559 --> 11:33.336
and one ﬂying in
to it from the left.

11:34.829 --> 11:36.208
Wait, it's actually a pail.

11:37.532 --> 11:38.511
And the woman?

11:39.534 --> 11:41.744
0h, she's light
behind the pond.

11:44.039 --> 11:45.520
Standing upright...

11:45.807 --> 11:48.984
looking towards the top left
comer of the image.

11:49.311 --> 11:54.595
And... she is splashing
water in the same direction as well.

11:55.484 --> 11:57.797
She's got some sort of a
contraption on her left hand.

11:58.020 --> 11:59.729
Yeah... it was sprained.

12:00.823 --> 12:03.306
Well, it's giving her character.

12:04.827 --> 12:06.034
And what about the background!

12:07.029 --> 12:09.137
There are a lot of
trees in the background.

12:09.732 --> 12:12.238
Small house...
with a gable roof.

12:13.436 --> 12:14.279
Gable roof.'

12:17.240 --> 12:18.585
A sloped roof.

12:20.444 --> 12:21.583
And what about the light!

12:22.680 --> 12:25.493
I like the way the light is falling.
It's sort of angular,

12:25.683 --> 12:27.221
coming down from
top left and behind.

12:27.752 --> 12:31.066
I think the background would have
looked better with lesser elements.

12:37.029 --> 12:39.136
It's just too crowded
at the moment, I think.

12:39.364 --> 12:42.177
Also, there are yellow pillow cases.

12:43.268 --> 12:43.940
Yellow?

12:44.537 --> 12:48.887
Yeah. It doesn't work as well in
black 8: white as it does in color.

12:49.309 --> 12:51.416
Why were you looking
at the colored version?

12:51.877 --> 12:53.415
I was curious.

12:55.381 --> 12:56.885
Okay, so will you vectolize
it please!

12:58.551 --> 13:03.164
It doesn't work as well with
all the elements in the image...

13:03.390 --> 13:04.768
to be brought down to a line drawing.

13:04.958 --> 13:07.567
Yeah, I know I'd miss most of the
details. I'd still like to see it though.

13:07.761 --> 13:08.433
Sure. Yeah.

13:09.831 --> 13:11.140
Do you want to see another one!

13:25.513 --> 13:27.860
Stop... Stop!
Reverse... Reverse.

14:13.231 --> 14:15.840
See, there's one where
the guy in the right side...

14:16.034 --> 14:18.175
is actually being covered by
a passing rickshaw.

14:18.370 --> 14:20.750
And you can only
see his...

14:23.575 --> 14:26.081
light hand pointing
accusingly at the other guy.

14:26.312 --> 14:28.487
I think that's the one. It looks nice.
- No, leave it.

14:29.015 --> 14:29.824
What!

14:31.017 --> 14:31.496
Why!

14:32.485 --> 14:34.262
Doesn't sound exciting to me.

14:35.488 --> 14:38.028
But... It's a crazy moment here.
It's nice.

14:38.225 --> 14:41.209
Will you start making the sauce!
It'll be forever before we eat.

14:42.195 --> 14:44.838
All I am saying is that
it's a very good image.

14:46.066 --> 14:47.068
It's accidental.

14:47.368 --> 14:50.580
Oh, please! Don't start that again.
- Don't start the "don't start again".

14:51.572 --> 14:52.745
All I am saying is
you don't have to

14:52.941 --> 14:54.717
be in conscious control of
your art all the time.

14:54.909 --> 14:56.913
You can be intuitive.
- It is intuitive.

14:57.111 --> 14:58.922
I am not writing intellectually
stimulating essays here.

14:59.113 --> 15:01.460
lam very much aware I am
just taking pictures.

15:01.683 --> 15:02.958
Well, then?
- Then what?

15:03.117 --> 15:05.396
What's your problem?
- I don't have one.

15:05.587 --> 15:06.566
What's your problem with
this picture!

15:06.755 --> 15:08.931
I don't even know this picture.
What's your hang-up!

15:09.124 --> 15:10.935
Look, I just feel
you're throwing away...

15:11.126 --> 15:13.472
a brilliant piece of your art
just because of a stupid hang-up.

15:13.696 --> 15:16.578
I don't like it. That's why I am
dumping it. ls that fair enough for you!

15:16.766 --> 15:19.477
Okay, let me just give you
a perfect description, alright!

15:20.470 --> 15:22.645
Let's vectolize or etch it...

15:22.872 --> 15:26.085
and write a piece of poem in capture
the essence, and then you decide.

15:26.276 --> 15:28.087
IIO.
- What "no"?

15:28.812 --> 15:31.090
Listen, these ale the things
I depend on, right!

15:31.281 --> 15:35.291
I have to draw opinion and assurance
about my own art from what others say.

15:35.486 --> 15:37.092
Yes, but you've continued
to produce great work...

15:37.288 --> 15:38.267
Says who?

15:38.455 --> 15:38.991
Says everybody.

15:39.223 --> 15:41.501
Who the hell is everybody'!
Everyone is so fucking stupid.

15:41.659 --> 15:44.939
They watch stupid soap operas.
They fight over religion and ideas.

15:45.129 --> 15:45.904
What are we arguing about?

15:46.097 --> 15:47.133
Okay, I'll tell you what...

15:47.332 --> 15:49.371
Remember the other day at
my parents' when...

15:49.601 --> 15:52.107
Uncle Kumar was talking about
the orchestra I shot fol!

15:52.304 --> 15:54.616
Remember what he said?
- That he thought they were alright, so!

15:54.807 --> 15:57.016
No no. He said something
to the effect of...

15:57.242 --> 15:59.452
that he was wondering whether
it was the music...

15:59.645 --> 16:01.820
Let me finish first.

16:02.014 --> 16:03.119
What's it got to do
with Kumal Uncle anyway!

16:03.316 --> 16:04.295
Let me finish my sentence!

16:04.483 --> 16:06.761
You don't even know what I am going to say.
- Okay, make the point.

16:06.953 --> 16:08.558
I know where this is going...
- NO!

16:08.754 --> 16:11.067
So, fight alone then... if you
already know where it is going.

16:11.257 --> 16:12.236
Okay, what did he say'!

16:12.425 --> 16:13.929
Okay, he said something
to the effect of...

16:14.127 --> 16:16.166
that he didn't know whether it
was the music that was being

16:16.363 --> 16:17.536
celebrated or the fact that
they were all blind.

16:17.764 --> 16:19.541
I knew that you were going
to say this. I was there.

16:19.699 --> 16:20.644
He didn't say anything
like that.

16:20.834 --> 16:23.113
Fine! Good for you.
I was hallucinating!

16:24.371 --> 16:25.681
Besides, why would he say
something like that?

16:25.873 --> 16:27.148
Why are you being so obtuse!

16:27.474 --> 16:30.321
I am being obtuse?
That's very nice!

16:31.211 --> 16:33.056
No... I can't understand why

16:33.281 --> 16:35.923
each time I have doubts...
- I don't want to go there...

16:36.117 --> 16:38.656
Exactly! Just being a lesser
dramatic will help!

16:40.856 --> 16:42.963
Every time it doesn't have
to be this drama.

16:43.358 --> 16:44.998
I am just so fucking scaled of what
will trigger off...

16:45.193 --> 16:47.301
another unending phase of
painful introspection...

16:47.496 --> 16:50.673
and I'll be left outside, guessing
what the fuck you're going through.

16:52.734 --> 16:55.947
You're stiﬂing me all the time
by being so fucking scared.

16:58.641 --> 17:00.121
I wish you hadn't said that.

17:00.577 --> 17:03.025
Why are you taking this personally!
It's not about you.

17:03.546 --> 17:04.685
Okay. Alright.

17:05.415 --> 17:08.866
Let's take it easy then. You don't want this
picture for whatever reason, right!

17:09.319 --> 17:10.355
It's fine.

17:10.753 --> 17:12.029
I'll just put it in the
memory box, so that we

17:12.222 --> 17:14.226
can look back at what
we were fighting about.

17:14.558 --> 17:16.767
If you wish. I have no such illusions.
- What!

17:17.228 --> 17:20.440
Why are you doing thisl?
- What am I doing? I don't get it.

17:26.003 --> 17:27.679
Why did you get so
hard suddenly!

17:29.908 --> 17:30.910
Let me in.

17:38.717 --> 17:41.166
You know your work is good.
- How?

17:42.287 --> 17:43.426
Baby, please!

17:44.089 --> 17:45.968
Do not patronize me, okay!

18:28.804 --> 18:31.253
How was the meeting with the Kisstens?

18:33.476 --> 18:35.856
I went shopping with them today.

18:36.312 --> 18:39.194
I got you a very nice dress.

18:39.515 --> 18:42.294
Yaallah! Berlin is crazy.

18:42.485 --> 18:45.470
You have to see it.
- I will, one day.

18:46.323 --> 18:47.462
Of course, dear.

18:47.857 --> 18:50.636
Mom, do you remember?
We had once gone

18:50.827 --> 18:53.276
to Fayoum when I was small,
and just near the Nile...

18:53.463 --> 18:57.244
Nile! It was a lake, dear.

18:57.434 --> 19:00.077
Yeah. Same thing.

19:00.338 --> 19:03.185
Anyway, there was a swan cart, okay...
- There was what?

19:03.641 --> 19:04.848
A swan cart!

19:06.011 --> 19:07.116
A swan cart?

19:08.313 --> 19:09.657
I know this sounds ridiculous,
but I have a vivid memory of it.

19:09.848 --> 19:11.659
You know how you doubt sometimes,
if what you remember...

19:11.850 --> 19:15.961
is your own experience, some dream
or something somebody told you...

19:16.154 --> 19:20.801
that you pictured it so well that
it became your own memory.

19:21.560 --> 19:23.235
Strange things you remember.

19:24.630 --> 19:27.513
Hang on, I am getting a
call from the hospital.

19:30.403 --> 19:32.749
Hello?
- Aliya! Aliya!

19:34.807 --> 19:35.913
Yeah... that's me.

19:40.380 --> 19:43.193
Yeah, I'll be right there.
Thank you so much!

19:43.584 --> 19:44.289
Momma!

19:46.487 --> 19:49.664
I got a call from the hospital.
They're ready for the operation.

19:50.358 --> 19:51.394
Ready fol what?

19:51.592 --> 19:53.596
The operation Mom!
Just call up Dad and Vinay.

19:53.828 --> 19:55.172
Tell them to meet
me at the hospital.

19:55.363 --> 19:58.245
Okay! I will come
down soon, as well.

19:58.433 --> 20:02.749
Okay! Just call them quickly and tell
them to hurry... don't forget!

20:29.232 --> 20:31.077
Slowly open your eyes.

20:31.535 --> 20:32.344
Open.

20:33.770 --> 20:35.718
"Pen your eyes...
slowly. Very good!

20:37.241 --> 20:38.448
Don't squeeze.

20:41.045 --> 20:43.551
Slowly keep them open.
Open wide.

20:44.215 --> 20:47.200
Open both your eyes wide.
Very nice... very good!

20:47.719 --> 20:49.029
Open it completely.

20:49.955 --> 20:51.128
(an you see something!

21:19.086 --> 21:20.293
Very nice.

21:32.833 --> 21:34.815
You didn't sign up for this

25:23.747 --> 25:26.754
The graft that we had put in
is completely clear.

25:28.118 --> 25:29.565
It's beautiful.

25:30.387 --> 25:32.198
Let's look at the other eye.

25:36.060 --> 25:38.771
Left eye is the one which
we did first, right!

25:39.764 --> 25:40.539
Good!

25:41.933 --> 25:45.544
The left eye is very nice.
The graft is totally clear.

25:46.938 --> 25:51.323
It's even difficult to
tell that you have new eyes.

26:21.608 --> 26:23.989
It's changed a lot.
Don't you think!

26:40.996 --> 26:41.998
I have to go.

26:42.197 --> 26:44.544
Sir... excuse me!

26:45.000 --> 26:48.178
(an I take few pictures of you?
Here! Two minutes.

27:03.720 --> 27:05.531
Could you look outside?

27:41.427 --> 27:44.274
A frog once asked a centipede how is
it able to walk on a hundred feet...

27:44.497 --> 27:45.841
so gracefully synchronized...

27:46.232 --> 27:48.373
while the flog finds it
difficult to manage even Mo.

27:48.836 --> 27:51.114
The centipede took a moment to
analyze its own walk...

27:51.271 --> 27:52.307
and was bafﬂed.

27:52.538 --> 27:54.417
So... as it tried to walk further...

27:54.875 --> 27:56.982
its feet got entangled and
it tripped.

28:08.455 --> 28:09.663
No, no, no, no...

28:10.592 --> 28:13.405
What! They are good pictures.
- No, I don't like them.

28:13.895 --> 28:14.738
What are you doing!

28:14.929 --> 28:15.567
We!

28:18.100 --> 28:19.239
You can't just delete that!

32:00.870 --> 32:02.146
That's very dramatic.

32:04.307 --> 32:05.845
Have you seen the images?

32:06.544 --> 32:07.922
Yes, they're good.

32:14.986 --> 32:15.464
Good!

32:16.955 --> 32:17.934
Yeah!

32:18.890 --> 32:20.529
I think I really like
them by now.

32:28.533 --> 32:29.842
How did your lecture go?

32:31.503 --> 32:33.713
I think I should focus
on my book rather than

32:34.006 --> 32:35.646
wasting my time on lecture tours.

32:38.511 --> 32:39.718
Should we get ready in
an hour!

32:40.179 --> 32:42.184
Could you please call
them and cancel!

32:43.249 --> 32:43.954
<i>Sure.</i>

32:46.753 --> 32:48.530
What! You didn't even protest.

32:49.189 --> 32:50.670
Have you given up on me or what?

32:52.425 --> 32:53.370
Of course not, baby!

32:53.927 --> 32:55.704
You can take your time
with the blindfold.

33:02.703 --> 33:06.154
I can't just put it on before I take a
shot and then take it off, right?

33:06.574 --> 33:07.416
Yeah.

33:07.742 --> 33:09.951
But, you've seen the
pictures. It really works!

33:13.014 --> 33:14.893
Could you please tell me
what you really think?

33:15.517 --> 33:16.690
Like what?

33:19.121 --> 33:21.103
That it's a naive and
a stupid fixation.

33:21.624 --> 33:25.599
Yes, its naive, stupid, childish
and absolutely ridiculous.

33:26.395 --> 33:28.206
I think I just want to
go somewhere...

33:29.932 --> 33:31.311
...somewhere inspiring.

33:32.635 --> 33:34.116
With that?
- N0.

33:42.913 --> 33:44.451
You know I've been
doing some research...

33:44.648 --> 33:48.429
and I came across amazing work,
thatjust left me overwhelmed.

33:49.086 --> 33:50.795
There are a lot of
photographers who stage...

33:50.988 --> 33:53.129
elaborate scenes,
costumes, lights...

33:53.791 --> 33:57.071
and I think this just gives them
a sense of purpose.

33:57.462 --> 33:59.842
0r else you'd just be
waiting there to be lucky light.

34:00.065 --> 34:02.104
Probably at the light place.

34:02.500 --> 34:03.981
I mean, even then

34:04.169 --> 34:06.276
I really wonder what
inner skill you need...

34:06.471 --> 34:08.179
...to have a great moment
around you...

34:08.474 --> 34:10.683
and the clicking of your
camera come together.

34:13.112 --> 34:15.594
But there must be something
beyond that as well.

34:15.781 --> 34:17.956
Like beyond taking the picture!
- Yeah.

40:57.743 --> 40:59.349
Now that you have saved its life

40:59.545 --> 41:02.552
will you also give it a propel
upbringing and a good education!

41:05.919 --> 41:08.698
What if it was the worm': karma
to just lie there and get crushed!

41:09.055 --> 41:12.040
Well, is it lying there getting crushed?
So, perhaps, it wasn't.

41:12.759 --> 41:15.106
Or worse, the worm was trying
to commit suicide...

41:15.730 --> 41:19.944
and you've put it in the pot, and now it
has to crawl it's way back to nirvana.

41:21.469 --> 41:22.778
Do you believe in our case...Z

41:22.970 --> 41:25.783
lam sorry I didn't get your name...
- Charvalra!

41:25.973 --> 41:27.352
Really'! Your parents named you that?

41:27.575 --> 41:31.459
No. My parents named me Madhava after
the great theologist Madhavacharya.

41:32.080 --> 41:34.187
But I decided to switch sides
at the age of fourteen.

41:36.218 --> 41:38.667
Yeah. I do believe in our
case, but I am here...

41:38.887 --> 41:43.204
to learn to win an
argument from both sides.

41:43.893 --> 41:44.929
We are...
- Okay, we got to go.

41:45.128 --> 41:47.269
We are all blind men trying
to perceive the elephant.

41:47.764 --> 41:50.110
How are you blind?
You're wearing glasses.

41:50.933 --> 41:55.114
Serial number u, writ
petition 212 of 2010.

41:55.639 --> 41:58.088
Iadyship, please.
I appeal on behalf of the petitioner.

41:58.275 --> 42:00.758
I appeal on behalf of
respondent number 1.

42:00.945 --> 42:04.225
Yes, Mr. Gupta, a meat-eating lawyer
for an animal rights case!

42:04.515 --> 42:06.622
My client has made me
change my ways.

42:07.117 --> 42:09.259
Okay, what is this matter about?

42:09.587 --> 42:12.970
Well, this is about testing of
chemicals on animals.

42:13.524 --> 42:17.807
Pharmaceuticals companies in India
are constantly violating animal rights.

42:17.996 --> 42:22.450
Every ethical and scientific research
points to this having to stop.

42:23.302 --> 42:25.250
I know that may not
be possible now

42:25.671 --> 42:28.952
but what we are looking
at is the...

42:29.308 --> 42:32.451
complete elimination of cosmetic
and non-essential research.

42:32.645 --> 42:35.993
Okay, okay. That calls for a larger debate.
Who's appearing for the board!

42:36.182 --> 42:39.861
Your ladyship, we monitor

42:40.120 --> 42:43.127
And the report submitted by them
has been as per the guidelines.

42:43.323 --> 42:46.865
It is very difficult fol us to monitor
this on a day-to-day basis.

42:47.060 --> 42:49.839
These are my humble submissions
to this honorable court.

42:50.398 --> 42:54.214
My Lord, if this is the response of
the board then what remains in this petition?

42:55.036 --> 42:59.489
Public interest litigation nowadays, has
become more like "publicity" interest litigation.

42:59.673 --> 43:02.156
And this petition should be
rejected at this stage.

43:02.343 --> 43:05.351
Okay, okay. We'll hear from you, Mr. Gupta.
- Very well.

43:05.547 --> 43:08.588
The question is that animals
which are kept in laboratories...

43:08.817 --> 43:10.492
...they are treated completely ruthlessly.

43:10.685 --> 43:14.227
They're to be killed, they are to die,
and they are treated as dead.

43:14.422 --> 43:15.926
They are kept in cramped spaces

43:16.158 --> 43:18.037
they fight with each other,
they hurt each other.

43:18.227 --> 43:20.038
They get burnt, they get cut up

43:20.229 --> 43:22.212
they suffer from diarrhea, paralysis...

43:22.565 --> 43:23.943
the conditions are despicable!

43:24.167 --> 43:26.946
In fact, my learned friend
is not accurately instructed.

43:27.103 --> 43:31.214
We've recently installed air-conditioning
and ten by ten cages for these animals.

43:31.407 --> 43:33.856
Yes, but then you cram ten animals
in those ten by ten cages!

43:34.044 --> 43:35.548
Well, that's certainly more luxury than

43:35.746 --> 43:38.058
a commuter enjoys on a
suburban train in Mumbai!

43:38.248 --> 43:39.751
That was not warranted, Mr. Dastool!

43:40.017 --> 43:41.691
What I was trying to submit was...

43:42.086 --> 43:43.863
that there ale many
mole pressing issues

43:44.055 --> 43:46.196
which the court should
concern themselves with...

43:46.390 --> 43:48.394
rather than this sentimental petition.

43:49.126 --> 43:50.334
Okay, we'll heal from Ml. Gupta.

43:50.862 --> 43:52.810
My lord, the point really
is that molecules are

43:52.964 --> 43:55.447
required to be tested on
animals before they are

43:55.866 --> 43:57.142
used on human beings.

43:57.903 --> 43:58.939
Well, I don't know about that,

43:59.137 --> 44:00.446
because there's severe criticism

44:00.639 --> 44:03.919
of that within the
scientific community itself.

44:04.410 --> 44:06.084
Today, we have stem-cell research

44:06.279 --> 44:08.761
we have computer based research...
there are many other options.

44:08.947 --> 44:12.923
The point we are dealing with is the
conditions in which these animals ale kept

44:13.119 --> 44:14.759
and how they are treated.

45:01.337 --> 45:04.184
Sol heal your Guluji is in Boston now.

45:04.641 --> 45:09.356
He, like our beloved Maitreya, is
more an academic, less a monk.

45:09.879 --> 45:12.989
The fringe benefits of knowing English.

45:14.685 --> 45:18.033
The poster for the anti-leather campaign.
- Aah. It's good.

45:18.722 --> 45:20.897
Nice. Just cut down on
the sentimentality a bit.

45:21.225 --> 45:23.207
We must address people's reason mole.

45:27.298 --> 45:29.405
Have you forgotten your promise!

45:29.968 --> 45:35.652
It was your wish to sponsor a
community center for my guru.

45:36.341 --> 45:38.015
Wasn't it?

45:39.178 --> 45:43.187
All of you are so self absorbed.

45:43.415 --> 45:47.231
You have forgotten your duties.

45:51.090 --> 45:53.369
That's why I am reminding you

45:54.227 --> 45:59.079
of your promises of sponsorship

46:00.066 --> 46:05.248
and processions with great pomp.

46:06.172 --> 46:09.521
I will be a committed devotee,
once my son gets married.

46:09.776 --> 46:11.223
Shall we start?
- Yes... yes.

46:11.578 --> 46:16.693
Even Mr. Mahesh wishes to contribute.

46:17.552 --> 46:20.365
Feel free to start!

46:28.596 --> 46:34.781
There are no celestial beings I know of.

46:36.772 --> 46:38.811
There is no god either.

46:39.042 --> 46:42.549
Neither heaven, nor hell.

46:43.146 --> 46:48.500
Neither a preserver, nor an
owner of this universe.

46:50.387 --> 46:58.007
Neither a creator nor a destroyer.
No eternal judge.

46:58.996 --> 47:04.611
There is only the law of causality.

47:04.935 --> 47:09.941
I take responsibility for my actions
and their consequences.

47:17.015 --> 47:22.471
The smallest of creatures have
a life-force just like mine.

47:22.988 --> 47:30.882
May I always have such compassion.
May I never cause any harm to anybody.

47:31.430 --> 47:36.647
The truth is multi-faceted, and
there ale many ways to leach it.

47:37.670 --> 47:43.354
May I find balance in this duality.

47:43.977 --> 47:47.485
I pray, may my karma of ignorance be shed.

47:47.681 --> 47:55.836
May my true self be liberated from
the cycle of life and death.

47:56.024 --> 47:57.368
And attain moksha.

48:18.681 --> 48:20.720
So, I heal you are
a writer of jokes...

48:21.384 --> 48:23.696
No, as in, I have a stand-up
act which I write myself.

48:23.886 --> 48:27.030
Say something funny!
- That's like me saying, say something deep.

48:27.490 --> 48:28.435
I can be deep.

48:28.692 --> 48:34.478
See, once a monk went to a sandwich seller
and asked him, make me one with all!

48:38.335 --> 48:40.010
I have one which is
equally terrible.

48:40.204 --> 48:42.379
Which email can attain cyber
enlightenment?

48:42.606 --> 48:43.951
What does that mean!

48:45.910 --> 48:46.548
Which!

48:46.944 --> 48:48.391
One that has no attachment!

48:49.781 --> 48:53.426
I'm sorry, I'm just in this phase
of life where I find

48:53.751 --> 48:56.633
everything that comes with no
attachments lather fascinating.

48:57.455 --> 48:59.164
I read your book, by the way.
It was engaging.

48:59.391 --> 49:00.370
Oh! Thank you for reading it.

49:00.559 --> 49:02.700
I didn't buy it of course.
One of my friends lent it to me.

49:02.895 --> 49:05.504
But I have a few apprehensions.
- That's a good thing. Tell me.

49:06.599 --> 49:08.706
Like I haven't lead
the entire thing, but...

49:09.235 --> 49:11.012
the hundred and fifty
pages that I have read...

49:13.239 --> 49:17.624
you say you're an atheist, and at the same
time you believe in the concept of soul

49:18.044 --> 49:19.423
which I think is rather convenient.

49:19.813 --> 49:24.494
I don't think karmic causality is a reason
enough for anybody to behave ethically.

49:25.452 --> 49:28.493
You know, that there is
retribution of any kind

49:29.156 --> 49:31.104
in this life or any other

49:32.927 --> 49:36.105
It's like a weak man's hope for
some kind of cosmic revenge.

49:36.331 --> 49:39.781
I agree with you. It's very easy to believe
in something out of fear and guilt.

49:39.968 --> 49:40.469
Collect!

49:40.668 --> 49:43.778
All ethics must be arrived at in
isolation of religious beliefs.

49:44.239 --> 49:46.745
But are you able to practice that?
- I hope I am.

49:50.312 --> 49:52.316
Why do monks beg alms!

49:53.449 --> 49:55.796
Because hunger drives the world.

49:57.186 --> 49:58.633
And once that's out of the way

49:58.821 --> 50:00.426
there ale more important
things we can focus on.

50:00.623 --> 50:03.128
And also, it makes me
more patient and humble.

50:03.493 --> 50:04.700
Humble?
- Yes!

50:05.328 --> 50:05.806
Why!

50:06.762 --> 50:08.300
So will you be begging
my boss for food?

50:08.498 --> 50:11.345
No... but why did you
snigger at "humble"?

50:13.136 --> 50:14.411
I remembered something.

50:15.105 --> 50:17.554
No, rituals are symbolic theater. Once you
have accepted the symbol

50:17.708 --> 50:18.881
or the truth behind the symbol

50:19.109 --> 50:21.592
there is no need to stress
on it all the time.

50:22.012 --> 50:25.293
And you're expecting more people
to follow your religion!

50:25.549 --> 50:28.396
No, I am on no such mission.
- Okay, your ideas.

50:28.887 --> 50:30.162
Yes, I like to share them

50:30.622 --> 50:34.574
and see what comes out of it, but not
in religious discourses and conferences.

50:34.893 --> 50:38.071
I like to shale them with the
political and scientific mainstream.

50:39.331 --> 50:41.677
Something like the Copenhagen
Climate Change Summit?

50:42.034 --> 50:43.674
Yes. Why not!

50:44.570 --> 50:46.244
And will you walk to Copenhagen!

50:46.539 --> 50:47.518
Of course!

50:47.806 --> 50:53.091
Or you could keep walking inside
the plane, that way you'll reach...

50:57.350 --> 50:59.663
Ah, so you've found yourself
a new protege!

50:59.853 --> 51:02.131
Ah, he's the master.

51:04.658 --> 51:06.469
So, how did the interview go?

51:06.693 --> 51:08.072
Interview?

51:09.196 --> 51:11.736
He was on a talk show yesterday.
-Live? Did I miss something?

51:12.066 --> 51:13.672
No, not really.

51:14.168 --> 51:15.774
It's going to be broadcast
in a month or so, isn't it!

51:15.937 --> 51:20.083
Yes, it all started with the same assumption
of me being a naive romantic

51:20.275 --> 51:22.814
who is trying to imagine that the
world will tum vegan overnight.

51:23.044 --> 51:24.080
Well, don't you!

51:24.279 --> 51:25.988
Come on, who has these delusions?

51:26.749 --> 51:29.631
All that we have demanded is a
practical, reasonable, scientific

51:29.851 --> 51:31.890
change in the system so that
we can lessen suffering.

51:32.087 --> 51:34.866
You know, I secretly share
a part of their cynicism.

51:35.458 --> 51:37.064
I mean, does our case really hold?

51:37.260 --> 51:40.301
We're asking them to make the
cages bigger, to better the hygiene

51:40.529 --> 51:42.169
to stop the force feeding,
the torture

51:42.365 --> 51:45.247
but how does it make sense because they
ale all going to be butchered in the end!

51:45.435 --> 51:47.747
But let their lives be
better than their death.

51:47.937 --> 51:49.748
Yes. And just because they are
marked for slaughter

51:49.939 --> 51:52.149
doesn't mean you abuse and torture them.
What kind of logic is that?

51:52.809 --> 51:54.654
Tenzing Rinpoche was there yesterday.
- Really'!

51:54.879 --> 51:56.758
Yes. And I am joining him fol the
Peace March next month.

51:56.947 --> 51:59.829
Oh yes, I heard they ale protesting against
the visit of a Chinese ambassador.

52:00.050 --> 52:01.759
Yes, they are.

52:02.119 --> 52:03.259
What are you trying to do!

52:04.054 --> 52:07.232
Jagannath told me you had severe
pain in the abdomen yesterday.

52:07.959 --> 52:09.405
Why are you looking at him!

52:09.627 --> 52:11.302
You have loose motions as well!
- Nothing!

52:11.495 --> 52:12.976
And don't fool me into shelling
out money now.

52:13.164 --> 52:14.770
You don't have any. Just lie down.

52:15.066 --> 52:16.273
MI. Gupta! How are you!

52:19.471 --> 52:23.685
I've got your book.
The one you had ordered.

52:24.476 --> 52:25.649
Your liver is slightly enlarged.

52:25.845 --> 52:30.389
What is this discount for!
- It's for all my customers.

52:31.317 --> 52:33.322
Will you take medicines!
- N0.

52:35.188 --> 52:38.365
Okay, only if it will be necessary.
- Yes, it will be.

52:44.665 --> 52:47.342
Thank you MLMehta.
- Thank you very much.

53:09.291 --> 53:10.897
Who invited you here today'!

53:12.127 --> 53:17.446
I'm not here m see you.
I have other friends here.

53:26.509 --> 53:28.354
It's very good.

53:29.045 --> 53:30.354
(an I stop taking medicines now?

53:30.547 --> 53:35.365
Let the course complete.

53:48.366 --> 53:50.245
Here's your magazine.

53:55.007 --> 53:57.889
0h, wow... thank you!

53:58.510 --> 53:59.455
How ale you feeling!

53:59.945 --> 54:01.152
I'm better after taking
the herbal decoction.

54:01.380 --> 54:02.826
Decoction? What about the medicines!

54:03.081 --> 54:04.585
There was no need for medicines.

54:05.251 --> 54:07.028
I'll have m shut shop this way.

54:07.753 --> 54:09.200
See you later.
- Sit for a bit.

54:09.388 --> 54:11.597
Can't. Too much work.

54:12.859 --> 54:15.341
He says he's better with the herbs.

54:15.529 --> 54:17.374
What can we do!

54:39.387 --> 54:42.269
Sir, this case will take forever.

54:43.091 --> 54:44.470
We have our ways of doing things

54:44.660 --> 54:47.837
but I want to avoid
unpleasant situations.

54:48.497 --> 54:53.508
We'd be happy to make a donation to
a charity on your behalf.

54:54.904 --> 54:56.509
You know what you need to do.

56:18.326 --> 56:19.635
It's what I was afraid of.

56:21.063 --> 56:22.065
Liver cirrhosis.

56:22.998 --> 56:24.205
What's that? Eancel!

56:24.666 --> 56:26.306
No, it's not cancer.

56:27.368 --> 56:29.908
Cancel can be one of the
complications of cirrhosis.

56:30.339 --> 56:31.978
But we won't worry
about that at this stage.

56:32.174 --> 56:33.849
How much of the truth
will you tell me?

56:34.110 --> 56:35.454
The whole truth.

56:36.545 --> 56:40.497
So, should I prepare to end up here soon!
- No, nothing like that.

56:40.950 --> 56:44.834
See, cirrhosis has reached an
advanced stage.

56:45.622 --> 56:49.335
We'll be focusing on preventing
complications and getting a transplant.

56:50.094 --> 56:52.599
Transplant?
- Yes. It's imperative.

56:56.033 --> 56:57.537
That means lots of medication!

56:57.768 --> 56:58.440
YES-

56:58.803 --> 56:59.908
0f what kind?

58:31.201 --> 58:32.579
Iagannath, bring me the list please.

58:33.170 --> 58:35.652
You can have them. Dr. Bhargava
has prescribed these.

58:36.473 --> 58:37.748
Just bring me the list.

59:12.679 --> 59:14.490
It has three equivalents here.

59:14.781 --> 59:16.285
It's a very old list.

59:17.750 --> 59:18.889
We'll deal with it tomorrow.

59:44.380 --> 59:48.526
All the jungles have disappeared

59:50.486 --> 59:56.374
And we are trapped in cages

59:58.227 --> 01:00:00.267
It's going well!
- Thank you.

01:00:00.730 --> 01:00:03.008
They are traveling around with it.
- Ah! Okay.

01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:09.749
Ijust wanted afresh list of all the
companies that have not yet signed on the

01:00:10.506 --> 01:00:11.953
Illegal Treatment to Animals Act.

01:00:12.142 --> 01:00:13.521
There isn't a single
pharmaceutical company,

01:00:13.744 --> 01:00:15.919
that doesn't violate animal
testing guidelines,

01:00:16.180 --> 01:00:17.353
in one way or another.

01:00:19.317 --> 01:00:20.490
This one's pretty exhaustive.

01:00:20.684 --> 01:00:23.395
It's arranged according to the
brand names and formula patent.

01:00:24.856 --> 01:00:27.703
And here's the latest documentation.
You can take that as well.

01:00:31.163 --> 01:00:32.666
How is your case progressing?

01:00:33.265 --> 01:00:36.910
0h, it'll change a lot of things now.
Thank you so much.

01:00:38.704 --> 01:00:42.018
So, this is where you carry out
your Experiments with Truth?

01:00:42.608 --> 01:00:45.319
You know, this place leeks
of a violent past.

01:00:45.878 --> 01:00:47.882
Just convenient fol the community.

01:00:48.214 --> 01:00:50.321
It was the only place we
found on our way.

01:00:50.516 --> 01:00:52.795
This is the second time we
are in a biology lab this week.

01:00:52.986 --> 01:00:54.261
How ale you keeping!

01:00:54.788 --> 01:00:55.631
I'm alright.

01:00:57.524 --> 01:00:58.697
<i>Fastafaxian'.!</i>

01:00:59.393 --> 01:01:01.534
ls that a new joke?
- Not mine, and it's not a joke.

01:01:01.728 --> 01:01:03.539
It's a very serious religion
I follow!

01:01:04.631 --> 01:01:06.773
You know, I always knew
monks are closet drinkers

01:01:07.301 --> 01:01:09.807
but unfortunately liver cirrhosis
is going to give you away.

01:01:10.004 --> 01:01:13.147
You know it should have more to do with
intoxication than with drinking.

01:01:14.575 --> 01:01:17.057
We leave tomorrow...

01:01:17.245 --> 01:01:18.782
Why are you not taking medicines?

01:01:20.315 --> 01:01:21.317
Because there are no alternatives.

01:01:21.516 --> 01:01:22.724
Every medicine has animal
violence behind it.

01:01:22.918 --> 01:01:24.866
But how does your boycotting
make a difference!

01:01:25.053 --> 01:01:26.534
That way, nothing
makes a difference.

01:01:26.722 --> 01:01:28.863
Exactly! See, it's pretty clear
how inconsequential

01:01:29.057 --> 01:01:30.902
our actions are in the
larger scheme of things.

01:01:31.093 --> 01:01:32.768
I am not convinced.

01:01:33.395 --> 01:01:37.940
Every molecule in the universe is
affected by our actions.

01:01:38.434 --> 01:01:40.713
That is the truth or else
everything is meaningless.

01:01:41.104 --> 01:01:42.779
What is the sense of
existence then?

01:01:43.373 --> 01:01:45.912
The hedonism and nihilism of
your namesake, Chalvaka!

01:01:48.445 --> 01:01:52.397
So, your worldview provides
you with meaning... purpose?

01:01:52.615 --> 01:01:53.652
See, we are dualists.

01:01:54.218 --> 01:01:55.893
If you were to ask me if life
is perpetual or temporary,

01:01:56.086 --> 01:01:57.465
I would say, it's both.

01:01:57.955 --> 01:02:00.302
Temporary for the body
and infinite for the soul.

01:02:00.558 --> 01:02:02.506
The soul is formless, shapeless,
it's non-matter...

01:02:02.693 --> 01:02:05.540
And it connects to the world
through the body...

01:02:05.730 --> 01:02:08.339
and every minute action, even inaction,

01:02:08.533 --> 01:02:11.142
leaves behind a karmic
record on the soul.

01:02:12.437 --> 01:02:14.316
And the purpose of our
existence is

01:02:14.573 --> 01:02:16.919
enlightenment and eventual liberation

01:02:17.109 --> 01:02:18.920
from the perpetual suffering
of life and death.

01:02:19.111 --> 01:02:21.958
Okay, so then why is it so
important m not kill?

01:02:22.715 --> 01:02:26.393
I mean, if you kill an animal, it's probably
going to come back, perhaps happier.

01:02:26.586 --> 01:02:29.536
Freedom of choice and light of consent
is the core of our world view.

01:02:29.722 --> 01:02:33.937
What about killing by consent?
- I-low do you judge the validity of consent?

01:02:37.731 --> 01:02:39.109
What about the violence
that you are

01:02:39.299 --> 01:02:41.578
committing on yourself by
not taking medication?

01:02:42.269 --> 01:02:43.477
How is your choice
a choice of sanity!

01:02:43.671 --> 01:02:46.017
How is it not different
from a suicide bomber

01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:48.080
who is so convinced about
the fundamentalism

01:02:48.276 --> 01:02:49.916
of his political and religious thoughts?

01:02:50.979 --> 01:02:52.618
Are you really making
that analogy?

01:02:54.749 --> 01:02:55.785
What happened?

01:02:56.618 --> 01:02:58.759
See, I am not good at this
but I am going to try.

01:03:00.422 --> 01:03:04.203
There are a lot of people who love you,
respect you and need you including myself.

01:03:04.860 --> 01:03:07.742
I know you're a rational, open minded
person so I can only suggest...

01:03:08.463 --> 01:03:09.569
Please take care of yourself.

01:03:09.965 --> 01:03:10.671
O
I wnll.

01:03:13.101 --> 01:03:14.137
I'll see you later then.

01:03:14.970 --> 01:03:15.676
Stay for a while.

01:03:16.005 --> 01:03:16.677
NO.

01:09:50.591 --> 01:09:52.939
You know, one of my friends
interns at Munshi and lal.

01:09:53.529 --> 01:09:56.137
I think you've mentioned of him before.
ls he good! - No.

01:09:56.532 --> 01:10:00.814
But this comes from him. Apparently, they used
some local muscle to threaten Maitreya.

01:10:00.971 --> 01:10:01.950
What! When!

01:10:02.405 --> 01:10:04.080
A little while ago.
It was a soft call.

01:10:04.374 --> 01:10:07.825
They studied his routine
for a couple of days

01:10:08.111 --> 01:10:10.321
and then they tried to comer him
on one of the rainy nights

01:10:10.548 --> 01:10:12.359
when he was just beginning
his walk to the court.

01:10:12.550 --> 01:10:15.591
The partners of the firm were very
angry with their client for doing this.

01:10:15.786 --> 01:10:18.655
Now, what I am surprised about is that Maitreya
hasn't mentioned any of this to any of us.

01:10:18.656 --> 01:10:19.397
Now, what I am surprised about is that Maitreya
hasn't mentioned any of this to any of us.

01:10:19.991 --> 01:10:23.032
He's not going to mention it.
For all you know, he won't even remember.

01:10:23.962 --> 01:10:25.602
What exactly did
Jagannath say!

01:10:25.797 --> 01:10:28.144
Just what I told you
over the phone.

01:10:28.567 --> 01:10:32.075
That he has stopped eating,
and he rarely speaks.

01:10:33.105 --> 01:10:36.642
Jagannath believes that Maitreya has
taken Sansal Bhava Bhagga vow!

01:10:36.643 --> 01:10:36.677
Jagannath believes that Maitreya has
taken Sansal Bhava Bhagga vow!

01:10:36.976 --> 01:10:38.012
What is that!

01:10:38.844 --> 01:10:41.019
It's an ancient custom in
his religion.

01:10:41.247 --> 01:10:44.026
A monk ailing from an
untreatable disease

01:10:44.450 --> 01:10:47.662
can make peace with himself and
choose to withdraw from life.

01:10:47.955 --> 01:10:49.230
How do you withdraw from life?

01:10:50.090 --> 01:10:52.038
It's one way of saying
fast unto death.

01:10:52.192 --> 01:10:53.673
Fast unto death!
That's extreme!

01:10:54.461 --> 01:10:54.594
But, his liver cirrhosis is
treatable, right!

01:10:54.595 --> 01:10:56.270
But, his liver cirrhosis is
treatable, right!

01:10:56.464 --> 01:10:57.808
Not the way he prefers it.

01:10:57.998 --> 01:10:59.502
I don't get this idea
of karma.

01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:01.406
Does the intention not matter
at all!

01:11:01.602 --> 01:11:05.247
The experiments are not being conducted
with the intention of inflicting pain...

01:11:05.439 --> 01:11:07.318
but the intention of
relieving pain.

01:11:08.510 --> 01:11:12.613
You see, in his world, it's not all humanity
that's equal, it's all existence that's equal.

01:11:12.614 --> 01:11:14.152
You see, in his world, it's not all humanity
that's equal, it's all existence that's equal.

01:11:14.449 --> 01:11:19.335
But, anyway, keep working on it. We'll need
ideas like these before we can make him budge.

01:11:25.528 --> 01:11:26.371
There was an island...

01:11:27.196 --> 01:11:29.872
and you were to be reborn
as a tormentor or a slave.

01:11:30.466 --> 01:11:30.565
The tormentor would make
life hell for you.

01:11:30.566 --> 01:11:32.309
The tormentor would make
life hell for you.

01:11:32.969 --> 01:11:36.511
He will give infinite pain to you
and your kin, just for his pleasure.

01:11:38.241 --> 01:11:42.888
And... he had no remorse
over his actions to crush his victim.

01:11:43.714 --> 01:11:48.429
Add to that there was no
karma, no soul, no retribution...

01:11:50.254 --> 01:11:52.737
no being responsible
for your actions.

01:11:53.891 --> 01:11:56.568
And you had to choose
any one of them. Who would you be!

01:11:57.728 --> 01:11:59.175
You do realize that you're
going to give up your life,

01:11:59.397 --> 01:12:01.572
for something that is nothing
mole than a thought experiment!

01:12:05.003 --> 01:12:05.641
And...

01:12:06.404 --> 01:12:06.436
monks are supposed to
be celibate, right!

01:12:06.437 --> 01:12:08.077
Monks are supposed to
be celibate, right!

01:12:08.441 --> 01:12:12.393
So, I don't understand why there is so much
intellectual masturbation in the first place!

01:12:13.779 --> 01:12:15.454
Look into your own religion.

01:12:15.781 --> 01:12:17.626
There's constant reference
to relativity.

01:12:18.350 --> 01:12:19.193
Your ancients...

01:12:20.119 --> 01:12:21.326
they were masters of understanding...

01:12:21.554 --> 01:12:23.889
that there is no one ultimate
rule book for all situations.

01:12:23.890 --> 01:12:24.231
That there is no one ultimate
rule book for all situations.

01:12:24.891 --> 01:12:27.397
The woman churning
curd into butter...

01:12:28.562 --> 01:12:30.407
she has to pull one
end of the lope

01:12:30.763 --> 01:12:33.372
and let the other end go
otherwise the rope will bleak.

01:12:33.934 --> 01:12:37.043
Contradictions and polarities are
two ends of the same rope.

01:12:38.138 --> 01:12:40.587
You pull one end and
let the other end go.

01:12:41.209 --> 01:12:41.908
Yes, it's very convenient to
hold on to one lope

01:12:41.909 --> 01:12:43.584
Yes, it's very convenient to
hold on to one lope

01:12:43.811 --> 01:12:46.351
and let the other one lose
as and when you feel like.

01:12:47.716 --> 01:12:49.390
I guess we all agree
with reason...

01:12:51.319 --> 01:12:53.164
now it's only a
matter of disposition.

01:17:03.221 --> 01:17:04.531
Keep sleeping.

01:17:04.756 --> 01:17:05.701
How ale you feeling!

01:17:05.891 --> 01:17:06.893
Fantastic.

01:17:07.526 --> 01:17:08.505
Are you up for some banter?

01:17:08.694 --> 01:17:09.639
Always.

01:17:10.262 --> 01:17:11.241
<i>L EM you a gift.</i>

01:17:15.167 --> 01:17:15.873
Alphabet.

01:17:21.173 --> 01:17:22.552
It's amazing how we imagine

01:17:23.343 --> 01:17:26.691
that someday these few alphabets will
just arrange themselves in a way

01:17:26.946 --> 01:17:27.947
that suddenly everything
will make perfect sense.

01:17:27.948 --> 01:17:29.451
That suddenly everything
will make perfect sense.

01:17:29.683 --> 01:17:30.891
A permutation of known words...

01:17:31.084 --> 01:17:33.532
suddenly bringing forward a
previously unknown meaning.

01:17:35.255 --> 01:17:39.436
It's so oppressive, this obsession
with final answers.

01:17:40.794 --> 01:17:45.806
We invent god, soul, heaven, afterlife,
even life-imitating technology...

01:17:46.801 --> 01:17:50.274
all sons of transcendence to cope
with the idea of an absolute end.

01:17:51.940 --> 01:17:56.223
And then, we die for an idea, which
promises some sort of immortality.

01:18:03.953 --> 01:18:04.052
It gives me some kicks
though, to know that

01:18:04.053 --> 01:18:06.434
It gives me some kicks
though, to know that

01:18:06.756 --> 01:18:09.535
a part of me was a part of
an animal once...

01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:11.697
aﬂame, a star.

01:18:12.395 --> 01:18:13.534
A part will become mineral,

01:18:13.930 --> 01:18:15.308
flow in a plant, sprout in a fruit,

01:18:15.498 --> 01:18:17.036
get pecked by a bird.

01:18:18.635 --> 01:18:22.017
Every atom of my body
recycled by the universe.

01:18:23.407 --> 01:18:25.787
You think you're a person
but you're a colony.

01:18:26.610 --> 01:18:29.788
A microcosm, which has ten times
more bacteria in its body

01:18:30.081 --> 01:18:31.288
than it has human cells.

01:18:32.183 --> 01:18:33.322
Here, check this out.

01:18:39.357 --> 01:18:39.956
U for Unilateralis Cordyceps.

01:18:39.957 --> 01:18:41.768
U for Unilateralis Cordyceps.

01:18:43.361 --> 01:18:46.072
The fungus enters an ant's
body through its respiration.

01:18:46.699 --> 01:18:49.204
It invades it's brain and changes
how it perceives smell...

01:18:49.535 --> 01:18:52.712
because ants do everything they do
from their smell of pheromones, right?

01:18:52.972 --> 01:18:54.647
So this microscopic little
fungal spore

01:18:54.840 --> 01:18:57.542
then makes the ant climb up the stem
of a plant and bite hard on a leaf

01:18:57.543 --> 01:18:57.954
then makes the ant climb up the stem
of a plant and bite hard on a leaf

01:18:58.144 --> 01:18:59.351
with an abnormal force.

01:19:00.146 --> 01:19:02.595
The fungus then kills the ant,
and continues to glow

01:19:03.116 --> 01:19:05.098
leaving the aunt's exoskeleton intact.

01:19:05.719 --> 01:19:10.035
So, a small fungus drives an ant around
as a vehicle, uses it as food and shelter

01:19:10.224 --> 01:19:12.399
and then as the ultimate monument to itself.

01:19:13.227 --> 01:19:15.072
And when the fungus is ready to reproduce

01:19:15.295 --> 01:19:15.628
it's fruiting bodies grow from
the aunt's head and rupture

01:19:15.629 --> 01:19:18.112
it's fruiting bodies grow from
the aunt's head and rupture

01:19:18.566 --> 01:19:22.541
releasing the spores, letting the wind
carry them to more unsuspecting food.

01:19:23.838 --> 01:19:24.476
There...

01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:28.249
our entire idea of flee
will down the bin.

01:19:29.710 --> 01:19:32.319
One single small fungus
spore does that to an ant.

01:19:32.981 --> 01:19:33.515
You have trillions of bacteria
in your body.

01:19:33.516 --> 01:19:35.155
You have trillions of bacteria
in your body.

01:19:36.184 --> 01:19:37.220
How do you know
where you end...

01:19:37.419 --> 01:19:39.230
and where your
environment begins!

01:20:15.593 --> 01:20:18.202
Sir, please tell me...

01:20:18.564 --> 01:20:20.341
Do we really have souls!

01:20:27.573 --> 01:20:28.952
Sir, please tell me

01:20:30.642 --> 01:20:31.519
I don't know.

01:22:03.174 --> 01:22:06.648
Why am I tied?

01:22:08.581 --> 01:22:09.526
Do you need something!

01:22:09.748 --> 01:22:10.727
Call my mother.

01:22:13.753 --> 01:22:14.219
Please try to understand.

01:22:14.220 --> 01:22:16.031
Please try to understand.

01:22:24.764 --> 01:22:25.938
Is that you, Jagannath?

01:22:27.167 --> 01:22:30.778
Are you okay?
-Yes. How are you feeling?

01:22:31.504 --> 01:22:32.238
Are you mocking me!

01:22:32.239 --> 01:22:32.741
Are you mocking me!

01:22:34.609 --> 01:22:36.716
What are you saying?

01:22:39.914 --> 01:22:41.122
How much time do we have?

01:22:41.349 --> 01:22:42.693
For what?

01:23:34.506 --> 01:23:35.611
Jagannath...

01:23:39.577 --> 01:23:40.386
Yes, sir!

01:23:49.187 --> 01:23:50.827
Call Doctor Bhalgava.

01:23:54.827 --> 01:23:57.436
Tell him I agree.

01:24:03.036 --> 01:24:05.679
I am not ready to go yet.

01:25:37.404 --> 01:25:39.181
The price is still low.

01:25:39.639 --> 01:25:42.088
What was at 1200 is now 30o.

01:25:43.877 --> 01:25:45.221
One second.

01:25:46.947 --> 01:25:47.949
Yes, sir.

01:25:51.785 --> 01:25:53.460
Bro!

01:25:55.756 --> 01:25:57.739
<i>W: a debit of Rs. 350,000.</i>

01:25:59.994 --> 01:26:02.169
Sir, can I collect the cheque tomorrow?

01:26:02.764 --> 01:26:06.215
You won't get these prices in the market.

01:26:07.902 --> 01:26:09.577
Okay, I'll wait for your call.

01:26:10.672 --> 01:26:12.780
Did you ask when we can leave?
- Today!

01:26:13.341 --> 01:26:16.519
Of course. Ask today!
- I mean we can leave today.

01:26:17.346 --> 01:26:18.850
Who told you!
- The nurse.

01:26:19.415 --> 01:26:21.294
Who told her?
- I-low would I know?

01:26:21.784 --> 01:26:24.495
She said your reports are alright,
your creatinine levels seem normal.

01:26:24.687 --> 01:26:27.068
Get the discharge papers, and leave.
- tan I take these off now!

01:26:27.957 --> 01:26:28.936
Maybe.

01:26:29.793 --> 01:26:33.175
Trust you to never
get propel answers.

01:26:33.663 --> 01:26:34.665
What are you watching!

01:26:34.998 --> 01:26:37.447
It's the same channel repeated all through.

01:26:37.767 --> 01:26:40.250
Idiot! Only 1, z, 3 and 8h
are the same. Here!

01:26:41.205 --> 01:26:42.686
What else did the nurse say'!

01:26:43.473 --> 01:26:44.475
Rest is private.

01:26:44.676 --> 01:26:46.680
Oi! Private chat! You bitch...

01:26:47.344 --> 01:26:48.689
Naveen!

01:26:48.879 --> 01:26:50.485
What are you guys up to?
- Nothing, sir!

01:26:50.815 --> 01:26:53.799
How ale you feeling today'!
- Perfect! May I leave today'!

01:26:54.052 --> 01:26:56.261
Let me check first.

01:27:01.026 --> 01:27:02.131
(an I take this off.'

01:27:02.461 --> 01:27:05.809
Sure. Nurse, help him.
Else he'll carry it home!

01:27:06.398 --> 01:27:08.380
Sir, come home sometime.

01:27:11.637 --> 01:27:16.524
I've been to your house plenty of times.
- Not since I moved to Mumbai.

01:27:17.076 --> 01:27:18.921
Yeah...

01:27:19.379 --> 01:27:20.654
How is your grandmother?

01:27:20.847 --> 01:27:21.553
She's great.

01:27:21.748 --> 01:27:24.254
Thanks to her, you've recovered
so soon.

01:27:24.551 --> 01:27:25.030
YES-

01:27:25.218 --> 01:27:26.323
What do you call her!
- Ajji!

01:27:26.520 --> 01:27:28.833
“Hiiz
' “iii.

01:27:29.056 --> 01:27:30.263
<i>Even we say 'Mai? 'm Marathi'!?</i>

01:27:30.491 --> 01:27:31.835
In Rajasthan, we say
'Baasah'...

01:27:32.025 --> 01:27:32.800
but I call he! Ajji.

01:27:32.993 --> 01:27:34.166
You speak Kannada!

01:27:34.662 --> 01:27:35.698
Not really.

01:27:35.896 --> 01:27:38.903
Mom used it only when
she was angry.

01:27:39.334 --> 01:27:42.147
So you've learnt the curses!
- Just the curses.

01:27:42.537 --> 01:27:45.214
Your grandmother speaks so many
languages... even Spanish.

01:27:45.907 --> 01:27:47.114
But she doesn't speak Marwali!

01:28:23.247 --> 01:28:26.060
When Mannu got the discharge
papers done

01:28:26.818 --> 01:28:28.526
I called some friends over.

01:28:29.087 --> 01:28:31.035
I thought we'd throw a party for you.

01:28:31.956 --> 01:28:33.960
Why don't you call some
of your friends!

01:28:34.792 --> 01:28:36.740
I don't have any friends
here in Mumbai.

01:28:38.730 --> 01:28:41.441
Mukhtiyal Ali is in the city.

01:28:42.467 --> 01:28:43.812
I have invited him too.

01:28:44.002 --> 01:28:45.711
Do you like his music!

01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:50.189
Even he is from Rajasthan.

01:28:50.443 --> 01:28:52.118
lam sure you must have
heard his music.

01:28:53.179 --> 01:28:54.854
No... never got a chance.

01:28:59.185 --> 01:29:01.133
How are you Raju?
- I'm good... and you, brothel!

01:29:01.321 --> 01:29:02.324
Great!

01:29:02.989 --> 01:29:04.334
I will join you in a moment.

01:29:06.760 --> 01:29:08.970
I had invited Ill. Kelkal as well

01:29:09.163 --> 01:29:11.611
but he is tied up with work.

01:29:13.100 --> 01:29:14.307
Did you get along with him?

01:29:14.535 --> 01:29:15.138
<i>Y“!</i>

01:29:16.371 --> 01:29:17.817
He speaks highly of you.

01:29:18.373 --> 01:29:20.753
He used to write revolutionary songs!
- Dr. Kerkal'!

01:29:20.975 --> 01:29:21.579
<i>Y“!</i>

01:29:22.044 --> 01:29:24.583
Just like your friend who had come
to see me at the hospital?

01:29:25.113 --> 01:29:26.058
YES-

01:29:26.682 --> 01:29:28.994
Did you lead her book?

01:29:29.518 --> 01:29:31.522
No... didn't get the time.

01:29:32.287 --> 01:29:35.602
When she gave you the book,
she asked if you would read it.

01:29:36.058 --> 01:29:37.037
Then, why did you say you would?

01:29:37.293 --> 01:29:40.801
Ilow can I say no when
she's offering me her book?

01:29:41.363 --> 01:29:42.867
She'll be here in the evening.

01:29:43.232 --> 01:29:45.111
Tell he! the truth if she asks.

01:29:46.068 --> 01:29:48.278
Don't make alibis like
not having had the time.

01:29:49.005 --> 01:29:49.711
Okay;

01:29:53.977 --> 01:29:54.820
Wait a second.

01:29:55.245 --> 01:29:57.193
The address is light here...
it's on the poster.

01:29:58.081 --> 01:30:02.694
It's not .net, it's .edu. E-D-U

01:30:03.887 --> 01:30:05.988
Yeah... I'm sorry.

01:30:05.989 --> 01:30:06.000
Yeah... I'm sorry.

01:30:07.425 --> 01:30:09.202
You got it light?

01:30:19.037 --> 01:30:20.313
Hey! How are you?

01:30:20.572 --> 01:30:21.711
I'm good, how ale you?

01:30:22.007 --> 01:30:23.646
I'm good. How are you feeling now?

01:30:24.509 --> 01:30:25.488
I'm perfectly fine now.

01:30:25.711 --> 01:30:26.554
What are you up
to these days!

01:30:27.179 --> 01:30:28.558
Lot of things have been happening.

01:30:28.748 --> 01:30:32.564
An activist has been
imprisoned in Chattisgalh

01:30:33.085 --> 01:30:34.862
for baseless charges...
- Navin Sir!

01:32:11.523 --> 01:32:14.234
Sexalia wants to meet us.
- It's Sekhselia, not 'Sexarir!

01:32:14.527 --> 01:32:16.668
Yamamoto guys coming along!
- IIO...

01:32:16.863 --> 01:32:18.640
But, he will give us the
cheque today.

01:32:21.134 --> 01:32:23.742
Where do we meet!
Your office has been hijacked.

01:32:31.011 --> 01:32:32.047
So, who did you vote fol!

01:32:32.246 --> 01:32:35.059
You don't have to answer that!
I-low can you ask?!

01:32:35.249 --> 01:32:36.251
I didn't vote.

01:32:36.717 --> 01:32:41.193
My deal grandson is only interested in
money not in the world around.

01:32:41.556 --> 01:32:43.094
At least someone
is interested in money.

01:32:43.324 --> 01:32:46.502
If everyone is bloke like us,
who'll pay our pensions!

01:32:55.838 --> 01:32:59.050
So, you like the college type!
Take this number down.

01:32:59.542 --> 01:33:01.421
Might come handy.
- No! Nothing like that.

01:33:01.611 --> 01:33:04.959
I'll take it...
for a lonely night!

01:33:05.215 --> 01:33:06.820
What about the Yamamoto meeting!

01:33:08.018 --> 01:33:08.793
YES-

01:33:13.089 --> 01:33:14.068
They've sent a cheque.

01:33:19.296 --> 01:33:20.401
This says 28th.

01:33:20.965 --> 01:33:22.104
The coming 28th.

01:33:22.867 --> 01:33:24.211
That one is hilarious!

01:33:25.369 --> 01:33:27.214
How's grandma now!
- She's fine.

01:33:27.906 --> 01:33:30.286
Tell me if you need any help -
legal... not so legal.

01:33:31.376 --> 01:33:32.651
I have connections up to Rao.

01:33:33.311 --> 01:33:34.985
Rao?
- State home minister!

01:33:35.213 --> 01:33:36.022
0h, light!

01:33:36.215 --> 01:33:38.094
(an I forward this?
- Sure.

01:34:03.277 --> 01:34:05.782
Will you call fol a nurse!

01:34:06.246 --> 01:34:08.023
I rang the bell a few times.

01:34:26.835 --> 01:34:28.372
(an you send a nurse
please?

01:34:28.604 --> 01:34:31.417
They're all busy in the
operation theatre.

01:34:32.107 --> 01:34:35.615
What about you?
- I am busy.

01:34:50.227 --> 01:34:53.074
No one': free.
Do you need to pee?

01:34:54.164 --> 01:34:56.146
I wanted to, but I'll wait.

01:34:56.333 --> 01:34:57.609
I'll help you.

01:34:59.036 --> 01:35:00.813
No, I can wait for a bit.

01:35:01.305 --> 01:35:04.846
They'll take at least half an hour.

01:35:25.665 --> 01:35:28.979
You're so liberal-minded,
then why are you feeling embarrassed!

01:38:12.743 --> 01:38:15.750
Saying that I am ignorant and
uneducated is one thing...

01:38:16.614 --> 01:38:19.997
but if you call me a sucker
for money wouldn't it hurt?

01:38:21.953 --> 01:38:23.558
I challenge you...

01:38:25.022 --> 01:38:28.405
only so you learn to live.

01:38:28.626 --> 01:38:31.166
Your way of looking at life cannot
be the only way, can it?

01:38:31.463 --> 01:38:33.570
Okay, then tell me your idea of living!

01:38:33.865 --> 01:38:38.512
I eat well, drink well... people
around me respect me.

01:38:39.471 --> 01:38:41.647
Is that enough?
- It's good enough for me.

01:38:43.476 --> 01:38:45.480
Life is so magnificent.

01:38:46.145 --> 01:38:49.493
There is so much to explore.
- I'm not interested!

01:38:49.815 --> 01:38:51.820
Does that make me a bad person?

01:38:52.618 --> 01:38:55.728
If you don't want to understand,
then don't talk rubbish.

01:38:56.222 --> 01:38:58.569
So, you tell me
What does one need in life!

01:38:58.925 --> 01:39:01.374
Happiness...
and some compassion...

01:39:01.662 --> 01:39:02.869
Isn't that enough!

01:39:03.998 --> 01:39:04.977
It's enough, yes.

01:39:05.799 --> 01:39:07.678
You can't reduce it to 'good' or 'bad'.

01:39:09.336 --> 01:39:13.380
It's about experiencing the entire
spectrum of thought and emotion

01:39:13.608 --> 01:39:15.111
about connecting with society.

01:39:15.610 --> 01:39:17.285
But, I am compassionate!

01:39:18.279 --> 01:39:21.729
You don't even know who
needs your compassion

01:39:23.018 --> 01:39:26.059
or what consequences your actions have.

01:39:27.322 --> 01:39:30.330
What is the point of such compassion!

01:39:30.626 --> 01:39:34.009
Society should benefit from
your existence!

01:39:34.197 --> 01:39:36.076
This is exactly what ticked off mom.

01:39:36.598 --> 01:39:39.047
All this idealistic jargon from
your pretentious friends!

01:39:39.434 --> 01:39:41.211
Another misunderstanding!

01:39:42.271 --> 01:39:46.884
They weren't pretentious.

01:39:47.511 --> 01:39:48.456
They were activists!

01:39:48.678 --> 01:39:52.562
Sacrificing one's life for a cause
is a huge expectation from anyone.

01:39:52.950 --> 01:39:57.802
See, this is why I don't
persuade you.

01:39:58.856 --> 01:40:01.339
Like I might have done with your mother.

01:40:01.825 --> 01:40:03.170
She was blessed with everything.

01:40:04.495 --> 01:40:05.497
But did she shale anything!

01:40:05.696 --> 01:40:08.681
And how have you
changed the world!

01:40:08.867 --> 01:40:11.406
When the nation was fighting for freedom
you'd leave mom with the neighbours

01:40:11.703 --> 01:40:13.981
and go off spreading condom
awareness in villages...

01:40:14.306 --> 01:40:16.117
Was that your revolution!

01:40:16.308 --> 01:40:18.951
If your work had made any difference, then
where did these billion people come from?!

01:40:19.145 --> 01:40:22.652
We've been fighting slavery and
repression for three generations...

01:40:22.849 --> 01:40:27.667
just to see my grandson
be a slave to the Americans?

01:40:27.853 --> 01:40:30.393
Have you gone senile!
These foreign companies are my clients!

01:40:30.590 --> 01:40:32.469
Look at your manners!

01:40:34.194 --> 01:40:36.837
Calling your own grandmother senile!

01:40:37.030 --> 01:40:38.203
Okay, I apologize.

01:40:38.398 --> 01:40:41.781
We'll confront this when one
of us understands the other.

01:40:42.002 --> 01:40:44.315
The country was
independent by then.

01:40:44.605 --> 01:40:48.147
Get your history light!
- Mannu! Take care of Ajji for a while.

01:40:48.609 --> 01:40:49.919
But what will I do in there?

01:40:50.178 --> 01:40:53.128
Shall I ask her to recommend me a book!
- Ale you crazy!

01:40:53.281 --> 01:40:54.921
She will cross examine
you for every page.

01:41:05.060 --> 01:41:07.907
Why are you watching this?
It's only on 1, 2, 3 and 84.

01:41:08.197 --> 01:41:09.176
Here!

01:42:35.623 --> 01:42:36.933
Has someone died!

01:42:37.358 --> 01:42:39.967
Her husband, poor guy, got fucked, man!
- What happened?

01:42:40.161 --> 01:42:43.271
He got his appendix operated
a month ago at some shady hospital.

01:42:43.799 --> 01:42:47.307
Got back to work in a couple of days...
he's a laborer.

01:42:47.502 --> 01:42:50.885
Collapsed, yesterday, on site.
His boss admitted him here.

01:42:51.507 --> 01:42:53.717
When they operated him again, they
found a kidney missing.

01:42:53.909 --> 01:42:54.786
What do you mean?

01:42:55.812 --> 01:42:58.124
When they opened him
up for the appendix

01:42:58.315 --> 01:42:59.761
they also ﬂicked his kidney.

01:43:00.250 --> 01:43:01.059
But how!

01:43:01.418 --> 01:43:04.801
It happens all the time in
those shady hospitals!

01:43:08.725 --> 01:43:10.934
Please go and ask her
the date of the operation.

01:43:11.395 --> 01:43:14.743
What the hell man?
Look at the ﬂight of stairs!

01:43:15.199 --> 01:43:16.838
Please.

01:43:17.434 --> 01:43:18.311
Oh man!

01:43:58.545 --> 01:44:00.083
The 16th of last month.

01:44:01.249 --> 01:44:02.558
When was yours?

01:44:03.450 --> 01:44:04.829
On the 17th.

01:44:07.889 --> 01:44:11.670
Find out his blood group.
- Again these stairs?

01:44:34.350 --> 01:44:35.888
Same as yours.

01:45:02.846 --> 01:45:04.886
Excuse me!
Which ward is Shankal in?

01:45:05.116 --> 01:45:07.120
Shankal who!
- The guy who got operated yesterday.

01:45:07.318 --> 01:45:09.961
His wife was crying, remember!
- He got discharged.

01:45:10.955 --> 01:45:13.962
But he was only operated yesterday.
- Yes, but he got discharged.

01:45:14.960 --> 01:45:16.441
(an I have his address!

01:45:16.996 --> 01:45:17.975
Wait.

01:45:29.542 --> 01:45:30.419
Hello Navin!

01:45:32.245 --> 01:45:35.024
Sir, the kidney, I've received...
Are you sure it's from a dead man?

01:45:35.215 --> 01:45:39.395
Of course! There are only two ways.
Either from a brain dead patient...

01:45:39.586 --> 01:45:40.930
or a family member.

01:45:44.925 --> 01:45:45.962
<i>S0...</i>

01:45:46.326 --> 01:45:48.501
can I get some information
about my donor'!

01:45:50.098 --> 01:45:52.911
I'll connect you to an N60.

01:45:53.101 --> 01:45:54.776
You can take it from there.

01:45:55.002 --> 01:45:56.881
They hold community meetings
between donors and recipients.

01:45:57.071 --> 01:45:59.782
Here, keep their card.

01:46:02.511 --> 01:46:04.824
The doctor confirmed that you didn't
get your kidney from that guy.

01:46:05.014 --> 01:46:06.221
Then, why do we need to meet him now!

01:46:06.682 --> 01:46:08.321
How do we know what's going on?

01:46:08.951 --> 01:46:11.491
I'll feel better once I clarify it
with the IIG0.

01:46:14.390 --> 01:46:17.237
And what if you discover you
have a stolen kidney'!

01:46:17.894 --> 01:46:18.930
I'll return it.

01:46:21.798 --> 01:46:23.575
Look ahead...
- Wait... wait!

01:46:24.901 --> 01:46:25.903
Have you lost it?

01:46:26.303 --> 01:46:28.307
Who returns a transplanted kidney'!

01:46:28.605 --> 01:46:31.111
- Isn't it possible?
"NO.

01:46:31.542 --> 01:46:33.581
The car won't squeeze through...

01:46:39.717 --> 01:46:41.665
Then what about you!
- I'll wait it out.

01:46:45.590 --> 01:46:46.865
It will jam against the wall.

01:46:50.095 --> 01:46:51.974
One second. let me check.

01:46:55.967 --> 01:46:58.074
Pull back...
- Ale you crazy!

01:46:58.304 --> 01:47:00.081
There's no space here, pull back.

01:47:03.509 --> 01:47:04.956
Let's palm him some money, then!

01:47:07.847 --> 01:47:08.883
But, that's wrong!

01:47:20.094 --> 01:47:23.101
Yes... Ves... Okay...
Okay... Thank you.

01:47:23.797 --> 01:47:25.335
You satisfied now!

01:47:26.100 --> 01:47:27.740
Yeah, the N60 says my
kidney is from a legit source.

01:47:27.935 --> 01:47:29.712
Lets get back m
the hospital than!

01:47:30.105 --> 01:47:30.776
Listen!

01:47:32.140 --> 01:47:34.088
Now that were here
let's meet him.

01:47:57.400 --> 01:47:58.937
Should I get us two coupons?

01:48:01.571 --> 01:48:03.553
Where is Shankar': house!

01:48:08.979 --> 01:48:14.298
Two buildings after Sachin's building
...light ahead.

01:48:15.686 --> 01:48:17.690
Wow! You have 46 here!
- Shut up.

01:48:33.105 --> 01:48:35.109
(an you draw us a map?

01:48:54.928 --> 01:48:56.204
Is this Shankal': house?

01:48:56.697 --> 01:48:58.201
Must be on the other
side, then.

01:48:59.800 --> 01:49:01.679
This way.
Where are you going!

01:49:03.637 --> 01:49:05.346
Where?
- No, he stays there...

01:49:05.573 --> 01:49:06.746
The snack-seller, light?

01:49:07.107 --> 01:49:09.989
Not the snack-seller!
The bricklayer.

01:49:11.946 --> 01:49:13.051
Careful.

01:49:23.659 --> 01:49:25.504
How do they walk up all these stairs!

01:49:35.772 --> 01:49:36.911
It's on the sea-link.

01:49:38.107 --> 01:49:39.452
Looks like he lives
there now!

01:49:44.681 --> 01:49:47.164
Oi! Push me.

01:49:47.818 --> 01:49:49.959
Tum, you buffoon!

01:49:50.454 --> 01:49:52.733
Push me, man!
- You'll get jammed like this.

01:49:55.327 --> 01:49:56.932
I'm hungry again.

01:50:03.001 --> 01:50:05.381
Where does Shankar live?
- Up there.

01:50:06.271 --> 01:50:07.273
Careful.

01:50:18.384 --> 01:50:18.920
Aumyg

01:50:19.284 --> 01:50:22.131
ls this Shankaﬂs house?
- No, not this one.

01:50:23.155 --> 01:50:25.137
It's there.
- Where?

01:50:28.794 --> 01:50:30.173
Listen!

01:50:30.897 --> 01:50:31.773
Yes, aunty'!

01:50:32.165 --> 01:50:34.306
The cops took him.

01:50:35.402 --> 01:50:36.542
Few minutes back.

01:50:54.489 --> 01:50:57.132
Sir, what about a similar case that
happened in Gurgaon six months back?

01:51:22.952 --> 01:51:23.795
Have you eaten!

01:51:34.531 --> 01:51:36.342
They will be punished, won't they'!

01:51:36.768 --> 01:51:37.873
Of course.

01:51:40.538 --> 01:51:42.076
They won't be, the bastards

01:51:43.541 --> 01:51:45.888
and the court case will burn me out.

01:51:48.480 --> 01:51:50.462
Let them go to hell!

01:51:52.718 --> 01:51:54.427
Their God will see to them.

01:51:55.921 --> 01:51:58.029
I don't want anything to do
with the courts, sir.

01:52:08.601 --> 01:52:09.410
This is for you.

01:52:14.008 --> 01:52:15.784
<i>Me you Mm me mess'!
- “U.</i>

01:52:17.979 --> 01:52:19.927
<i>Me you a cw'!
- “u.</i>

01:52:21.248 --> 01:52:26.100
Motherfucker! You think you can
pay your way out of this?

01:52:28.822 --> 01:52:30.462
Return my kidney.

01:52:31.592 --> 01:52:33.130
Leave him Shankal.

01:52:35.930 --> 01:52:38.037
What am Ito do, now?

01:52:43.839 --> 01:52:45.844
Shankar, we haven't stolen
your kidney.

01:52:53.883 --> 01:52:55.262
We want to help you.

01:52:59.522 --> 01:53:01.128
What will I do, now?

01:53:03.060 --> 01:53:04.438
We'll find him.

01:53:40.866 --> 01:53:42.905
Sekhsaria is pretty resourceful!

01:53:48.708 --> 01:53:49.517
Thank you!

01:53:55.449 --> 01:53:56.554
Where's Stockholm!

01:53:57.451 --> 01:53:58.795
How would I know!

01:53:59.386 --> 01:54:00.422
Ask.

01:54:47.570 --> 01:54:48.345
<i>N“!</i>

01:54:54.279 --> 01:54:56.557
When I was new in town I
would get confused as well.

01:54:56.947 --> 01:54:59.055
They drink straight from
the tap here.

01:55:06.958 --> 01:55:07.960
What is this party for?

01:55:08.159 --> 01:55:10.199
My friend, Rasmus...
It's his birthday!

01:55:10.829 --> 01:55:11.638
Loin us!

01:55:19.539 --> 01:55:21.646
Saw her moustache!

01:55:37.291 --> 01:55:39.295
Aron Jacobsen seems
like a nice guy.

01:55:39.626 --> 01:55:43.772
He didn't ask too many questions.
Try not to offend him, though.

01:55:43.965 --> 01:55:46.004
Here people sue each
other for every little thing.

01:55:46.401 --> 01:55:48.680
You'll be gone,
but I've got to live here.

01:55:48.870 --> 01:55:49.679
<i>Sure.</i>

01:56:12.828 --> 01:56:14.673
It's stuck. Careful.

01:56:19.435 --> 01:56:21.918
0h, I won't be able to alight from here.

01:56:24.341 --> 01:56:25.980
I'll get down from there.

01:56:38.523 --> 01:56:39.559
Welcome!

01:56:45.463 --> 01:56:47.172
Leave the shoes on.

01:57:01.815 --> 01:57:03.090
You are!

01:57:05.385 --> 01:57:08.027
Ajay.
- Hi! Navin.

01:57:10.390 --> 01:57:17.714
You mentioned your friend works
for a charitable organization!

01:57:18.065 --> 01:57:21.346
He wants to know which
organization do you work for.

01:57:21.502 --> 01:57:24.213
Ask him if he knows
who he got his kidney from.

01:57:24.672 --> 01:57:25.708
Kid nay'!

01:57:26.141 --> 01:57:28.749
Did you say kidney'!
- Yes, kidney.

01:57:31.579 --> 01:57:34.427
Do you know who donated
the kidney'!

01:57:39.488 --> 01:57:42.495
I don't want to talk about it.

01:57:42.791 --> 01:57:43.634
Will that be all!

01:57:44.459 --> 01:57:46.601
He doesn't want to
talk about it.

01:57:47.763 --> 01:57:51.305
(an I see your identification?

01:57:52.369 --> 01:57:55.182
He wants to see our ID.
let's get out of here.

01:58:16.160 --> 01:58:18.700
Your kidney stolen...
from this man.

01:58:18.897 --> 01:58:21.506
No, no, no...
Donated!

01:58:22.900 --> 01:58:26.374
I paid a lot of money
to everybody.

01:58:27.205 --> 01:58:29.517
What do you mean stolen!

01:58:30.175 --> 01:58:33.216
'Stulen'.
- I know stolen means 'stulen'.

01:58:34.647 --> 01:58:37.027
What does he
mean by stolen!

01:58:38.584 --> 01:58:42.297
A man in need of money sold his kidney.
lam told it happens all the time in India.

01:58:42.755 --> 01:58:46.263
It's best if you
leave.

01:58:47.193 --> 01:58:50.974
There was a needy person
who sold it to him...

01:58:51.365 --> 01:58:53.506
he was told it's a
common practice in India.

01:58:53.834 --> 01:58:55.144
Tell him exactly what
happened .

01:58:57.704 --> 01:58:58.683
Listen...

01:58:59.206 --> 01:59:00.881
give us a minute m explain.

01:59:01.075 --> 01:59:02.453
<i>“U! “o!</i>

01:59:03.010 --> 01:59:08.193
I don't understand this!
You come into my house...

01:59:09.551 --> 01:59:11.863
tell me you are from a
charitable organization...

01:59:12.053 --> 01:59:17.941
and now you show me this!
Such liars!

01:59:22.231 --> 01:59:24.611
He is calling us liars.

01:59:26.435 --> 01:59:28.941
This man was to be operated...

01:59:29.538 --> 01:59:31.178
for simple appendicitis.

01:59:31.775 --> 01:59:36.889
And a month later he finds out
his kidney was stolen.

01:59:38.282 --> 01:59:40.959
The racket has come out
in the open.

01:59:41.285 --> 01:59:44.064
Wasn't it Ill. Rajesh Thaloor
who operated on him!

01:59:44.922 --> 01:59:48.430
And all the doctors involved
in this racket have been nailed.

01:59:49.461 --> 01:59:52.308
Ask him if Rajesh Tharool had...
- That's what I am asking... hang on!

01:59:52.496 --> 01:59:56.710
Rajesh Tharool? He in jail?
- Yes... in jail!

01:59:59.804 --> 02:00:01.911
But he's a good man.

02:00:02.440 --> 02:00:03.420
Balls!

02:00:03.942 --> 02:00:05.651
Says he's a good man.
- Let it be!

02:00:10.616 --> 02:00:17.599
He's one of the biggest
profiteers from this racket.

02:00:19.626 --> 02:00:22.974
Were you actually told that the
donor was being paid for the kidney'!

02:00:25.632 --> 02:00:26.737
<i>“NBS-.</i>

02:00:27.633 --> 02:00:28.271
Exactly!

02:00:28.635 --> 02:00:30.948
They told him they were
going to buy him a kidney.

02:00:31.271 --> 02:00:33.310
Is it light to buy one?
- True.

02:00:34.307 --> 02:00:37.918
You think it's right
to buy a kidney'!

02:00:38.112 --> 02:00:40.617
Is it fail to use
poverty m your benefit?

02:00:40.982 --> 02:00:48.807
Is it fair to use somebody': poverty
to your benefit!

02:00:54.196 --> 02:00:56.804
You shouldn't be doing this.

02:01:01.737 --> 02:01:04.185
It's unfair to exploit
my guilt like this.

02:01:07.910 --> 02:01:12.057
What do you want from me!
- What do you want!

02:01:20.824 --> 02:01:24.605
I told you... this means trouble.

02:01:34.406 --> 02:01:39.360
Hey! It's me... Yes.
No, listen...

02:01:39.544 --> 02:01:41.492
Two guys from India are here...

02:01:45.851 --> 02:01:50.031
claim that they work for some
charitable organization.

02:01:51.056 --> 02:01:53.869
Yeah... listen, they are asking
about the kidney.

02:01:57.597 --> 02:01:59.773
That's not what I'm
trying to ask.

02:02:04.971 --> 02:02:06.816
They're accusing it's stolen.

02:02:08.908 --> 02:02:10.082
How? How is...?

02:02:15.082 --> 02:02:16.893
Yes, I'll call you later.

02:02:37.005 --> 02:02:40.890
I have no way of
confirming your claims.

02:02:43.746 --> 02:02:45.557
I was told that the kidney...

02:02:47.784 --> 02:02:50.233
was purchased from a
very needy person...

02:02:51.188 --> 02:02:52.896
for a rather handsome amount.

02:02:55.125 --> 02:02:58.736
I felt very guilty about
it even then.

02:03:05.135 --> 02:03:08.086
I felt the burden of guilt
at every stage of the operation.

02:03:12.643 --> 02:03:18.931
What could I have done?
What would anybody do!

02:03:30.295 --> 02:03:33.576
Wait for a matching donor
and die if you don't find one?

02:03:34.033 --> 02:03:39.887
Maybe my family was
protecting me emotionally...

02:03:40.139 --> 02:03:45.116
by not telling me
it was a stolen kidney.

02:03:47.847 --> 02:03:49.886
Maybe, the doctors feared they
will lose a client.

02:03:50.083 --> 02:03:56.975
But what could I have
done even if...

02:03:59.093 --> 02:04:06.315
they told me the kidney was...

02:04:07.702 --> 02:04:11.176
stolen from somebody!

02:04:17.779 --> 02:04:22.784
I'd like to believe you have
made up this entire story.

02:04:30.192 --> 02:04:33.370
And are instigating my guilt to
make an easy buck from me.

02:04:33.797 --> 02:04:37.840
You are lying. You should
leave before I call the cops.

02:04:39.736 --> 02:04:44.087
He's saying he didn't have an option.

02:04:44.408 --> 02:04:47.017
If he had waited, he
would be dead by now.

02:04:47.244 --> 02:04:48.953
And now he wants to
call the police because

02:04:49.146 --> 02:04:51.527
he thinks that we ale
hereto blackmail him.

02:04:51.749 --> 02:04:54.232
Brother, listen to me...
Let's get out of here.

02:05:01.560 --> 02:05:02.904
What the hell man!

02:05:11.437 --> 02:05:12.918
Talk to him.

02:05:16.341 --> 02:05:19.326
Tell him we just want
to help.

02:05:23.616 --> 02:05:24.322
Si"

02:05:39.100 --> 02:05:40.705
We just want to help.

02:05:45.807 --> 02:05:46.445
How?

02:05:48.443 --> 02:05:49.752
He's asking how.

02:05:50.378 --> 02:05:52.382
He would have to return
Shankar': kidney.

02:05:53.515 --> 02:05:54.962
Seriously'!

02:05:58.287 --> 02:06:02.296
Shankaﬂs kidney will have to
be returned to him.

02:06:05.328 --> 02:06:06.865
That's ridiculous.

02:06:11.301 --> 02:06:13.510
How is that a solution?
That's insane.

02:06:15.005 --> 02:06:17.887
He says that's foolishness.
What kind of solution is that?

02:06:24.048 --> 02:06:27.032
I can't possibly return
his kidney.

02:06:33.391 --> 02:06:35.065
I'll find him a donor.

02:06:41.399 --> 02:06:43.074
I'll pay for the operation.

02:06:51.377 --> 02:06:53.552
I'll take responsibility for everything.

02:06:56.116 --> 02:06:58.394
He is taking complete responsibility
for everything.

02:07:00.953 --> 02:07:02.491
I need to do this.

02:07:03.757 --> 02:07:06.297
He really wants to.

02:07:07.394 --> 02:07:08.373
Finish it, man.

02:07:12.465 --> 02:07:13.274
Okay.

02:07:14.968 --> 02:07:15.504
Okay.

02:07:29.050 --> 02:07:29.859
Let's go.

02:07:40.262 --> 02:07:40.968
Thank you.

02:09:11.159 --> 02:09:13.699
He has written...
Ajay and Navin...

02:09:14.396 --> 02:09:18.543
thank you fol all the
help so far...

02:09:19.368 --> 02:09:22.352
He doesn't want to see
us both again.

02:09:25.574 --> 02:09:28.559
Whatever remains to be sorted out...
is between him and Shankel.

02:09:29.245 --> 02:09:34.564
Tall my lawyer for any
further communication.

02:09:34.884 --> 02:09:37.060
Has he given his lawyer's number?
- Yes, it is here.

02:09:48.432 --> 02:09:49.571
One second...

02:09:50.235 --> 02:09:51.180
Hello!

02:09:51.937 --> 02:09:53.417
Yes! Hello!

02:09:54.239 --> 02:09:57.348
Hey man! Spared any chicks?
- You are crazy.

02:09:58.744 --> 02:09:59.883
Here, speak to him.

02:10:02.414 --> 02:10:03.359
Hello!

02:10:03.915 --> 02:10:05.521
Yes, sir?
- Yes Shankar...

02:10:05.985 --> 02:10:06.827
How ale you, brothel!

02:10:07.253 --> 02:10:10.465
Sir, thank you so much.
You've fixed everything so fast!

02:10:11.056 --> 02:10:12.263
Never thought I'd
see so much money!

02:10:12.458 --> 02:10:15.135
What are you talking about?
- tan you hear me!

02:10:15.628 --> 02:10:18.110
A white man came by this morning
and gave me Rs. 650,000.

02:10:18.298 --> 02:10:20.075
Don't take that money, Shankal.

02:10:20.433 --> 02:10:22.210
Why! I've already taken it.

02:10:22.402 --> 02:10:25.215
No, Shankel. Return the money.
We'll fight m get your kidney back.

02:10:25.405 --> 02:10:27.945
Are you crazy'! What will
I do with a kidney!

02:10:28.408 --> 02:10:32.555
The market rate fol a kidney is 30,000.
He's given me 650,000!

02:10:32.913 --> 02:10:35.226
You can't evaluate parts of a body.
We will sue them.

02:10:35.416 --> 02:10:37.227
You will get a new kidney
and the money you deserve.

02:10:37.418 --> 02:10:38.865
And what if I don't!
- Then I'll pay you.

02:10:39.020 --> 02:10:41.468
What's it to you?
You've already done enough.

02:10:41.689 --> 02:10:43.135
I don't want to waste my
life seeking justice.

02:10:43.324 --> 02:10:46.673
And, he said he'll
send me money every month.

02:10:47.429 --> 02:10:48.932
Hello!
Listen to me brother...

02:10:49.131 --> 02:10:51.443
He shoved the phone in my face...
- Give it back to him.

02:10:51.766 --> 02:10:54.477
<i>Shankaﬂ Wait'.
“h, great one'.!</i>

02:10:55.772 --> 02:10:56.979
One minute...

02:10:57.505 --> 02:10:59.818
I'm stuck, man... here.
- Listen Shankal...

02:11:00.275 --> 02:11:03.453
You deserve better.
We'll fight fol you!

02:11:03.946 --> 02:11:06.931
Not that bullshit again.

02:11:07.316 --> 02:11:10.095
I'll be getting money every month,
Why are you messing it up!

02:11:10.287 --> 02:11:13.294
Don't fuck it up.
Just let me be. Keep this!

02:12:01.274 --> 02:12:03.722
Okay, this is Omnacortil...

02:12:03.910 --> 02:12:05.448
which is 20mg now.

02:12:06.446 --> 02:12:09.259
Vaisocon was 10mg, but it's
been changed to 5mg.

02:12:09.449 --> 02:12:12.433
So, let me just keep it with me,
so you don't get confused.

02:12:13.086 --> 02:12:16.299
This is SOS. Only when required.
- Okay.

02:12:17.225 --> 02:12:19.001
And all the others
ale the same.

02:12:20.561 --> 02:12:22.372
It's all here in the box.
- Okay.

02:12:46.756 --> 02:12:47.735
Nothing came of it.

02:12:58.101 --> 02:13:01.951
All that happened... was because you
decided to do something about it.

02:13:21.426 --> 02:13:23.601
It's as good as it gets.

02:13:32.137 --> 02:13:34.416
Did your donor die from
a head injury!

02:13:35.008 --> 02:13:36.818
Yeah, he was a fit young man.

02:13:38.278 --> 02:13:40.089
What's at the museum?

02:13:40.647 --> 02:13:42.150
They are screening some videos...

02:13:42.349 --> 02:13:44.491
that the I60 has gathered
from his family.

02:13:44.851 --> 02:13:46.799
Will you be meeting
his family then?

02:13:47.020 --> 02:13:48.968
No, they have moved
to Dubai, it seems.

02:13:49.223 --> 02:13:50.669
The scleeninysjust for you?

02:13:50.858 --> 02:13:52.669
There are other recipients
as well.

02:13:52.860 --> 02:13:53.668
Others!

02:13:53.994 --> 02:13:57.103
The way I received one kidney,there
must be someone else who got the other one

02:13:57.331 --> 02:13:59.439
and those who received the
heart, the lungs, etc...

02:13:59.634 --> 02:14:01.912
They can transplant so many
organs from one man?

02:14:02.170 --> 02:14:04.152
Yes. Even skin.

02:14:04.705 --> 02:14:05.650
Eyes and ears!

02:14:05.840 --> 02:14:08.380
Eyes, yes.
Not sure about ears.

02:14:08.643 --> 02:14:09.646
(an I come along!

02:14:10.045 --> 02:14:12.084
No, it's only for the recipients.

02:14:13.015 --> 02:14:14.496
They say it's the
first time in the city...

02:14:14.683 --> 02:14:17.394
that eight people have received
organs from the same donor.

02:14:19.889 --> 02:14:22.668
I wonder what it'll be
like, to meet the others...

02:14:25.896 --> 02:14:28.242
we have a part each
from the same person.

02:14:30.199 --> 02:14:32.044
Isn't a man made up of his pans?

02:14:32.536 --> 02:14:33.743
There must be something more...

02:14:33.937 --> 02:14:36.113
Or else, replacing the parts
would change the person.

02:14:36.340 --> 02:14:37.445
Who knows!

02:14:40.745 --> 02:14:42.749
Where did you dirty your shirt!

02:14:42.947 --> 02:14:43.619
Where'!

02:14:43.848 --> 02:14:44.691
Look there!

02:14:46.251 --> 02:14:48.699
It's cool.
- Okay, bye.

02:14:51.056 --> 02:14:51.865
<i>Naveen'!</i>

02:14:52.423 --> 02:14:55.066
Hi! lam Vuki. I spoke to you
on the phone earlier today.

02:14:55.293 --> 02:14:56.638
Hi. Hope I am not late.

02:14:56.862 --> 02:14:58.810
No, foul recipients have leached,
two more are expected...

02:14:58.963 --> 02:15:00.308
then we'll start the
screening.

02:15:00.933 --> 02:15:02.437
0h! I thought there were
eight of us.

02:15:02.767 --> 02:15:05.580
The man who received the heart
isn't feeling well yet.

02:15:06.039 --> 02:15:08.921
His transplant was successful, but he's
still vulnerable to infection.

02:15:09.408 --> 02:15:10.684
Some organ donation forms...

02:15:10.876 --> 02:15:13.324
Please encourage your friends and
family to pledge their organs.

02:15:13.479 --> 02:15:14.925
Yeah.
- This is for you.

02:15:16.082 --> 02:15:17.461
Ah, you got the left one, right!

02:15:18.818 --> 02:15:20.926
This is Dr. Kala,
our N60': chairman.

02:15:22.422 --> 02:15:24.701
Ale we watching our
donor's home videos!

02:15:25.125 --> 02:15:27.107
No, he was a hobbyist
cave explorer.

02:15:27.294 --> 02:15:30.005
We'll be watching
some videos shot by him.

02:15:30.264 --> 02:15:31.744
Just have a seat with the
other recipients...

02:15:31.932 --> 02:15:33.311
and please keep your phone
on silent.

02:15:33.500 --> 02:15:34.809
Okay. Thank you.

01:14.333 --> 01:15.939
How come your doctor
back home allowed

01:16.135 --> 01:18.276
so much time after the first surgery!

01:18.471 --> 01:20.077
No, I just felt that...

01:20.239 --> 01:22.916
it would be too painful to go
through another operation back then.

01:24.678 --> 01:25.783
Keep your head straight, child.

01:26.045 --> 01:26.820
You mean emotionally'!

01:27.014 --> 01:27.321
Yeah.

01:27.514 --> 01:30.225
Besides it's also rare fol people
to donate eyes back home.

01:31.318 --> 01:32.525
Religious prejudice?

01:48.403 --> 01:49.884
Is this the coughing man!

02:01.718 --> 02:03.198
Are you going to do anything about it!

02:03.886 --> 02:04.729
Yeah.

02:14.731 --> 02:15.574
What are you doing!

02:19.637 --> 02:20.446
That looks nice.

02:20.738 --> 02:22.082
But which one do you like better!

02:22.272 --> 02:23.412
This one or...
- Edit

02:24.942 --> 02:26.218
Undo
- this one'!

02:27.578 --> 02:28.557
Show me again.

02:28.947 --> 02:29.721
Edit

02:31.382 --> 02:32.054
Redo

02:32.450 --> 02:34.227
Hmm... that looks better.

02:35.587 --> 02:36.726
Do you want the background so dark?

02:37.389 --> 02:38.266
Yeah.

03:04.250 --> 03:08.761
Maysoon said you've been
featured in today's Al Halam.

03:09.156 --> 03:11.297
Yeah, they did a phone interview.

03:12.293 --> 03:14.002
I am so excited!
I wish I could be present.

03:14.195 --> 03:16.575
I'll send you pictures and
videos from the exhibition.

03:18.265 --> 03:21.876
Is he coming!
- ls who coming!

03:23.170 --> 03:25.551
Of course, he is!
Mom, come on!

03:27.342 --> 03:28.686
I won't put my
bets on a man...

03:28.877 --> 03:32.521
who lives in the same city as his daughter
and sees her ten times in two years!

03:32.715 --> 03:34.697
You say these things about
each other...

03:34.883 --> 03:37.389
and then behave like
everything is normal...

03:37.620 --> 03:40.103
laughing and bitching
like teenagers!

03:42.691 --> 03:45.675
That's a healthy romantic idea
you have about your parents.

03:46.529 --> 03:49.376
Vinay, hello deal!
- Hi Hala!

03:50.299 --> 03:51.005
How ale you!

03:52.369 --> 03:54.248
I'm Okay. I'm Okay.

03:56.173 --> 03:59.714
Is grunge in again?
- Grunge! Well, I'm just lazy.

03:59.910 --> 04:03.794
You never sent me the animation you made.
- Oh, I'll send it to you... very soon.

04:04.549 --> 04:08.330
And have you recorded any new songs!
- Yeah, we did. I'll send them across too.

04:09.687 --> 04:15.166
And how is your Arabic?
- Pink. Fantastic. What-the-hell!

04:16.327 --> 04:17.603
I'm working on it.

05:24.967 --> 05:25.970
How is your mother!

05:26.502 --> 05:28.211
She is very good.
She sends her regards.

05:29.472 --> 05:30.611
Uncle, what are these?

05:31.608 --> 05:35.115
Those are bamboos.
They hold the building together.

05:35.846 --> 05:38.159
They are holding the building together!
- Yeah.

05:38.615 --> 05:39.617
How come!

05:47.091 --> 05:49.802
Bright orange. Deep yellow.

05:51.363 --> 05:52.240
Bright orange

06:05.010 --> 06:05.785
Red.

06:06.979 --> 06:07.651
What!

06:08.981 --> 06:10.758
I was just seeing where you ale.

06:12.685 --> 06:13.630
Red.

06:15.054 --> 06:16.329
Aunty, is this glass?

06:16.790 --> 06:17.565
YES-

06:18.558 --> 06:19.833
I'll close it for a second okay!

08:22.257 --> 08:25.434
And ljust hung around in their house
and explored the spaces...

08:25.627 --> 08:28.008
and I let them just be
as they were and...

08:28.596 --> 08:31.740
then I was really intrigued by the kid.
He was really friendly and...

08:32.134 --> 08:35.847
ljust kept following him and that's when
one of those pictures was clicked.

08:36.205 --> 08:39.553
So, you mentioned in your website
that you actually took up photography...

08:39.775 --> 08:44.058
after you lost your eyesight to
a cornea infection. -Yeah, true.

08:44.280 --> 08:45.089
Why photography!

08:46.950 --> 08:49.159
Well, first to document,
archive, and remember.

08:49.519 --> 08:52.366
Then, to kind of... explore,
understand and see.

08:53.157 --> 08:55.639
So, I guess all art evolves from
a need to record the apparent...

08:55.825 --> 08:57.135
to a need to capture the essence!

08:57.394 --> 09:00.777
That's very well put. I mean that's
exactly how it's been for me.

09:01.832 --> 09:03.541
When I first started
taking pictures...

09:03.734 --> 09:07.082
I was very much amused by the character
of the perfumer in Suskind's novel.

09:07.872 --> 09:11.153
Just the idea of a man trying
to capture every scent...

09:11.742 --> 09:14.453
starting from people to
surroundings to experiences.

09:14.680 --> 09:16.160
You know, it was very
much amusing.

09:16.982 --> 09:18.986
That's a very
interesting analogy.

09:19.818 --> 09:20.820
Why black and white!

09:21.520 --> 09:24.231
Itjust gives me more control
over the elements of my pictures.

09:24.423 --> 09:26.564
But do you ever feel
limited by anything!

09:27.659 --> 09:29.538
<i>“Mm... No'.!</i>

09:30.429 --> 09:31.774
That's... that's amazing.

09:33.900 --> 09:39.413
Is it! I mean... why is it so amazing
to not have limits or doubts!

09:41.708 --> 09:44.716
Honestly, I just can't wait to begin
my life as a photographer.

09:45.078 --> 09:49.258
But you are a photographer...
I mean, you're a good photographer!

10:07.035 --> 10:07.844
Hello!

10:10.239 --> 10:10.945
<i>/I/</i>

10:11.140 --> 10:13.179
ls that your house!
- Yes!

10:13.976 --> 10:16.823
So, I heal ducks, and lots of
animals. Are they inside!

10:17.079 --> 10:17.922
YES-

10:42.639 --> 10:43.243
Orlando! Ale you ready?

10:43.440 --> 10:43.976
Yeah.

10:44.175 --> 10:45.952
Aunty, can you start splashing!

10:51.349 --> 10:53.992
I will take the pictures from there,
okay!

10:54.319 --> 10:57.964
And I just want you to splash
the water on this side.

11:06.799 --> 11:08.474
Yeah, this one is quite an image.

11:09.002 --> 11:12.214
Alright, there's a very
small pond at the bottom.

11:13.372 --> 11:14.374
And...

11:15.008 --> 11:18.151
there ale foul ducks swimming
in foul opposite directions.

11:19.446 --> 11:23.330
And the one in the center is frozen in
the middle of its ﬂapping of the wings.

11:23.951 --> 11:26.764
There's one sitting at the some!
of the pond, away from us.

11:27.054 --> 11:28.500
It's wet.

11:29.289 --> 11:31.396
And there's one ﬂying in m
the flame from the light,

11:31.559 --> 11:33.336
and one ﬂying in
to it from the left.

11:34.829 --> 11:36.208
Wait, it's actually a pail.

11:37.532 --> 11:38.511
And the woman?

11:39.534 --> 11:41.744
0h, she's light
behind the pond.

11:44.039 --> 11:45.520
Standing upright...

11:45.807 --> 11:48.984
looking towards the top left
comer of the image.

11:49.311 --> 11:54.595
And... she is splashing
water in the same direction as well.

11:55.484 --> 11:57.797
She's got some sort of a
contraption on her left hand.

11:58.020 --> 11:59.729
Yeah... it was sprained.

12:00.823 --> 12:03.306
Well, it's giving her character.

12:04.827 --> 12:06.034
And what about the background!

12:07.029 --> 12:09.137
There are a lot of
trees in the background.

12:09.732 --> 12:12.238
Small house...
with a gable roof.

12:13.436 --> 12:14.279
Gable roof.'

12:17.240 --> 12:18.585
A sloped roof.

12:20.444 --> 12:21.583
And what about the light!

12:22.680 --> 12:25.493
I like the way the light is falling.
It's sort of angular,

12:25.683 --> 12:27.221
coming down from
top left and behind.

12:27.752 --> 12:31.066
I think the background would have
looked better with lesser elements.

12:37.029 --> 12:39.136
It's just too crowded
at the moment, I think.

12:39.364 --> 12:42.177
Also, there are yellow pillow cases.

12:43.268 --> 12:43.940
Yellow?

12:44.537 --> 12:48.887
Yeah. It doesn't work as well in
black 8: white as it does in color.

12:49.309 --> 12:51.416
Why were you looking
at the colored version?

12:51.877 --> 12:53.415
I was curious.

12:55.381 --> 12:56.885
Okay, so will you vectolize
it please!

12:58.551 --> 13:03.164
It doesn't work as well with
all the elements in the image...

13:03.390 --> 13:04.768
to be brought down to a line drawing.

13:04.958 --> 13:07.567
Yeah, I know I'd miss most of the
details. I'd still like to see it though.

13:07.761 --> 13:08.433
Sure. Yeah.

13:09.831 --> 13:11.140
Do you want to see another one!

13:25.513 --> 13:27.860
Stop... Stop!
Reverse... Reverse.

14:13.231 --> 14:15.840
See, there's one where
the guy in the right side...

14:16.034 --> 14:18.175
is actually being covered by
a passing rickshaw.

14:18.370 --> 14:20.750
And you can only
see his...

14:23.575 --> 14:26.081
light hand pointing
accusingly at the other guy.

14:26.312 --> 14:28.487
I think that's the one. It looks nice.
- No, leave it.

14:29.015 --> 14:29.824
What!

14:31.017 --> 14:31.496
Why!

14:32.485 --> 14:34.262
Doesn't sound exciting to me.

14:35.488 --> 14:38.028
But... It's a crazy moment here.
It's nice.

14:38.225 --> 14:41.209
Will you start making the sauce!
It'll be forever before we eat.

14:42.195 --> 14:44.838
All I am saying is that
it's a very good image.

14:46.066 --> 14:47.068
It's accidental.

14:47.368 --> 14:50.580
Oh, please! Don't start that again.
- Don't start the "don't start again".

14:51.572 --> 14:52.745
All I am saying is
you don't have to

14:52.941 --> 14:54.717
be in conscious control of
your art all the time.

14:54.909 --> 14:56.913
You can be intuitive.
- It is intuitive.

14:57.111 --> 14:58.922
I am not writing intellectually
stimulating essays here.

14:59.113 --> 15:01.460
lam very much aware I am
just taking pictures.

15:01.683 --> 15:02.958
Well, then?
- Then what?

15:03.117 --> 15:05.396
What's your problem?
- I don't have one.

15:05.587 --> 15:06.566
What's your problem with
this picture!

15:06.755 --> 15:08.931
I don't even know this picture.
What's your hang-up!

15:09.124 --> 15:10.935
Look, I just feel
you're throwing away...

15:11.126 --> 15:13.472
a brilliant piece of your art
just because of a stupid hang-up.

15:13.696 --> 15:16.578
I don't like it. That's why I am
dumping it. ls that fair enough for you!

15:16.766 --> 15:19.477
Okay, let me just give you
a perfect description, alright!

15:20.470 --> 15:22.645
Let's vectolize or etch it...

15:22.872 --> 15:26.085
and write a piece of poem in capture
the essence, and then you decide.

15:26.276 --> 15:28.087
IIO.
- What "no"?

15:28.812 --> 15:31.090
Listen, these ale the things
I depend on, right!

15:31.281 --> 15:35.291
I have to draw opinion and assurance
about my own art from what others say.

15:35.486 --> 15:37.092
Yes, but you've continued
to produce great work...

15:37.288 --> 15:38.267
Says who?

15:38.455 --> 15:38.991
Says everybody.

15:39.223 --> 15:41.501
Who the hell is everybody'!
Everyone is so fucking stupid.

15:41.659 --> 15:44.939
They watch stupid soap operas.
They fight over religion and ideas.

15:45.129 --> 15:45.904
What are we arguing about?

15:46.097 --> 15:47.133
Okay, I'll tell you what...

15:47.332 --> 15:49.371
Remember the other day at
my parents' when...

15:49.601 --> 15:52.107
Uncle Kumar was talking about
the orchestra I shot fol!

15:52.304 --> 15:54.616
Remember what he said?
- That he thought they were alright, so!

15:54.807 --> 15:57.016
No no. He said something
to the effect of...

15:57.242 --> 15:59.452
that he was wondering whether
it was the music...

15:59.645 --> 16:01.820
Let me finish first.

16:02.014 --> 16:03.119
What's it got to do
with Kumal Uncle anyway!

16:03.316 --> 16:04.295
Let me finish my sentence!

16:04.483 --> 16:06.761
You don't even know what I am going to say.
- Okay, make the point.

16:06.953 --> 16:08.558
I know where this is going...
- NO!

16:08.754 --> 16:11.067
So, fight alone then... if you
already know where it is going.

16:11.257 --> 16:12.236
Okay, what did he say'!

16:12.425 --> 16:13.929
Okay, he said something
to the effect of...

16:14.127 --> 16:16.166
that he didn't know whether it
was the music that was being

16:16.363 --> 16:17.536
celebrated or the fact that
they were all blind.

16:17.764 --> 16:19.541
I knew that you were going
to say this. I was there.

16:19.699 --> 16:20.644
He didn't say anything
like that.

16:20.834 --> 16:23.113
Fine! Good for you.
I was hallucinating!

16:24.371 --> 16:25.681
Besides, why would he say
something like that?

16:25.873 --> 16:27.148
Why are you being so obtuse!

16:27.474 --> 16:30.321
I am being obtuse?
That's very nice!

16:31.211 --> 16:33.056
No... I can't understand why

16:33.281 --> 16:35.923
each time I have doubts...
- I don't want to go there...

16:36.117 --> 16:38.656
Exactly! Just being a lesser
dramatic will help!

16:40.856 --> 16:42.963
Every time it doesn't have
to be this drama.

16:43.358 --> 16:44.998
I am just so fucking scaled of what
will trigger off...

16:45.193 --> 16:47.301
another unending phase of
painful introspection...

16:47.496 --> 16:50.673
and I'll be left outside, guessing
what the fuck you're going through.

16:52.734 --> 16:55.947
You're stiﬂing me all the time
by being so fucking scared.

16:58.641 --> 17:00.121
I wish you hadn't said that.

17:00.577 --> 17:03.025
Why are you taking this personally!
It's not about you.

17:03.546 --> 17:04.685
Okay. Alright.

17:05.415 --> 17:08.866
Let's take it easy then. You don't want this
picture for whatever reason, right!

17:09.319 --> 17:10.355
It's fine.

17:10.753 --> 17:12.029
I'll just put it in the
memory box, so that we

17:12.222 --> 17:14.226
can look back at what
we were fighting about.

17:14.558 --> 17:16.767
If you wish. I have no such illusions.
- What!

17:17.228 --> 17:20.440
Why are you doing thisl?
- What am I doing? I don't get it.

17:26.003 --> 17:27.679
Why did you get so
hard suddenly!

17:29.908 --> 17:30.910
Let me in.

17:38.717 --> 17:41.166
You know your work is good.
- How?

17:42.287 --> 17:43.426
Baby, please!

17:44.089 --> 17:45.968
Do not patronize me, okay!

18:28.804 --> 18:31.253
How was the meeting with the Kisstens?

18:33.476 --> 18:35.856
I went shopping with them today.

18:36.312 --> 18:39.194
I got you a very nice dress.

18:39.515 --> 18:42.294
Yaallah! Berlin is crazy.

18:42.485 --> 18:45.470
You have to see it.
- I will, one day.

18:46.323 --> 18:47.462
Of course, dear.

18:47.857 --> 18:50.636
Mom, do you remember?
We had once gone

18:50.827 --> 18:53.276
to Fayoum when I was small,
and just near the Nile...

18:53.463 --> 18:57.244
Nile! It was a lake, dear.

18:57.434 --> 19:00.077
Yeah. Same thing.

19:00.338 --> 19:03.185
Anyway, there was a swan cart, okay...
- There was what?

19:03.641 --> 19:04.848
A swan cart!

19:06.011 --> 19:07.116
A swan cart?

19:08.313 --> 19:09.657
I know this sounds ridiculous,
but I have a vivid memory of it.

19:09.848 --> 19:11.659
You know how you doubt sometimes,
if what you remember...

19:11.850 --> 19:15.961
is your own experience, some dream
or something somebody told you...

19:16.154 --> 19:20.801
that you pictured it so well that
it became your own memory.

19:21.560 --> 19:23.235
Strange things you remember.

19:24.630 --> 19:27.513
Hang on, I am getting a
call from the hospital.

19:30.403 --> 19:32.749
Hello?
- Aliya! Aliya!

19:34.807 --> 19:35.913
Yeah... that's me.

19:40.380 --> 19:43.193
Yeah, I'll be right there.
Thank you so much!

19:43.584 --> 19:44.289
Momma!

19:46.487 --> 19:49.664
I got a call from the hospital.
They're ready for the operation.

19:50.358 --> 19:51.394
Ready fol what?

19:51.592 --> 19:53.596
The operation Mom!
Just call up Dad and Vinay.

19:53.828 --> 19:55.172
Tell them to meet
me at the hospital.

19:55.363 --> 19:58.245
Okay! I will come
down soon, as well.

19:58.433 --> 20:02.749
Okay! Just call them quickly and tell
them to hurry... don't forget!

20:29.232 --> 20:31.077
Slowly open your eyes.

20:31.535 --> 20:32.344
Open.

20:33.770 --> 20:35.718
"Pen your eyes...
slowly. Very good!

20:37.241 --> 20:38.448
Don't squeeze.

20:41.045 --> 20:43.551
Slowly keep them open.
Open wide.

20:44.215 --> 20:47.200
Open both your eyes wide.
Very nice... very good!

20:47.719 --> 20:49.029
Open it completely.

20:49.955 --> 20:51.128
(an you see something!

21:19.086 --> 21:20.293
Very nice.

21:32.833 --> 21:34.815
You didn't sign up for this

25:23.747 --> 25:26.754
The graft that we had put in
is completely clear.

25:28.118 --> 25:29.565
It's beautiful.

25:30.387 --> 25:32.198
Let's look at the other eye.

25:36.060 --> 25:38.771
Left eye is the one which
we did first, right!

25:39.764 --> 25:40.539
Good!

25:41.933 --> 25:45.544
The left eye is very nice.
The graft is totally clear.

25:46.938 --> 25:51.323
It's even difficult to
tell that you have new eyes.

26:21.608 --> 26:23.989
It's changed a lot.
Don't you think!

26:40.996 --> 26:41.998
I have to go.

26:42.197 --> 26:44.544
Sir... excuse me!

26:45.000 --> 26:48.178
(an I take few pictures of you?
Here! Two minutes.

27:03.720 --> 27:05.531
Could you look outside?

27:41.427 --> 27:44.274
A frog once asked a centipede how is
it able to walk on a hundred feet...

27:44.497 --> 27:45.841
so gracefully synchronized...

27:46.232 --> 27:48.373
while the flog finds it
difficult to manage even Mo.

27:48.836 --> 27:51.114
The centipede took a moment to
analyze its own walk...

27:51.271 --> 27:52.307
and was bafﬂed.

27:52.538 --> 27:54.417
So... as it tried to walk further...

27:54.875 --> 27:56.982
its feet got entangled and
it tripped.

28:08.455 --> 28:09.663
No, no, no, no...

28:10.592 --> 28:13.405
What! They are good pictures.
- No, I don't like them.

28:13.895 --> 28:14.738
What are you doing!

28:14.929 --> 28:15.567
We!

28:18.100 --> 28:19.239
You can't just delete that!

32:00.870 --> 32:02.146
That's very dramatic.

32:04.307 --> 32:05.845
Have you seen the images?

32:06.544 --> 32:07.922
Yes, they're good.

32:14.986 --> 32:15.464
Good!

32:16.955 --> 32:17.934
Yeah!

32:18.890 --> 32:20.529
I think I really like
them by now.

32:28.533 --> 32:29.842
How did your lecture go?

32:31.503 --> 32:33.713
I think I should focus
on my book rather than

32:34.006 --> 32:35.646
wasting my time on lecture tours.

32:38.511 --> 32:39.718
Should we get ready in
an hour!

32:40.179 --> 32:42.184
Could you please call
them and cancel!

32:43.249 --> 32:43.954
<i>Sure.</i>

32:46.753 --> 32:48.530
What! You didn't even protest.

32:49.189 --> 32:50.670
Have you given up on me or what?

32:52.425 --> 32:53.370
Of course not, baby!

32:53.927 --> 32:55.704
You can take your time
with the blindfold.

33:02.703 --> 33:06.154
I can't just put it on before I take a
shot and then take it off, right?

33:06.574 --> 33:07.416
Yeah.

33:07.742 --> 33:09.951
But, you've seen the
pictures. It really works!

33:13.014 --> 33:14.893
Could you please tell me
what you really think?

33:15.517 --> 33:16.690
Like what?

33:19.121 --> 33:21.103
That it's a naive and
a stupid fixation.

33:21.624 --> 33:25.599
Yes, its naive, stupid, childish
and absolutely ridiculous.

33:26.395 --> 33:28.206
I think I just want to
go somewhere...

33:29.932 --> 33:31.311
...somewhere inspiring.

33:32.635 --> 33:34.116
With that?
- N0.

33:42.913 --> 33:44.451
You know I've been
doing some research...

33:44.648 --> 33:48.429
and I came across amazing work,
thatjust left me overwhelmed.

33:49.086 --> 33:50.795
There are a lot of
photographers who stage...

33:50.988 --> 33:53.129
elaborate scenes,
costumes, lights...

33:53.791 --> 33:57.071
and I think this just gives them
a sense of purpose.

33:57.462 --> 33:59.842
0r else you'd just be
waiting there to be lucky light.

34:00.065 --> 34:02.104
Probably at the light place.

34:02.500 --> 34:03.981
I mean, even then

34:04.169 --> 34:06.276
I really wonder what
inner skill you need...

34:06.471 --> 34:08.179
...to have a great moment
around you...

34:08.474 --> 34:10.683
and the clicking of your
camera come together.

34:13.112 --> 34:15.594
But there must be something
beyond that as well.

34:15.781 --> 34:17.956
Like beyond taking the picture!
- Yeah.

40:57.743 --> 40:59.349
Now that you have saved its life

40:59.545 --> 41:02.552
will you also give it a propel
upbringing and a good education!

41:05.919 --> 41:08.698
What if it was the worm': karma
to just lie there and get crushed!

41:09.055 --> 41:12.040
Well, is it lying there getting crushed?
So, perhaps, it wasn't.

41:12.759 --> 41:15.106
Or worse, the worm was trying
to commit suicide...

41:15.730 --> 41:19.944
and you've put it in the pot, and now it
has to crawl it's way back to nirvana.

41:21.469 --> 41:22.778
Do you believe in our case...Z

41:22.970 --> 41:25.783
lam sorry I didn't get your name...
- Charvalra!

41:25.973 --> 41:27.352
Really'! Your parents named you that?

41:27.575 --> 41:31.459
No. My parents named me Madhava after
the great theologist Madhavacharya.

41:32.080 --> 41:34.187
But I decided to switch sides
at the age of fourteen.

41:36.218 --> 41:38.667
Yeah. I do believe in our
case, but I am here...

41:38.887 --> 41:43.204
to learn to win an
argument from both sides.

41:43.893 --> 41:44.929
We are...
- Okay, we got to go.

41:45.128 --> 41:47.269
We are all blind men trying
to perceive the elephant.

41:47.764 --> 41:50.110
How are you blind?
You're wearing glasses.

41:50.933 --> 41:55.114
Serial number u, writ
petition 212 of 2010.

41:55.639 --> 41:58.088
Iadyship, please.
I appeal on behalf of the petitioner.

41:58.275 --> 42:00.758
I appeal on behalf of
respondent number 1.

42:00.945 --> 42:04.225
Yes, Mr. Gupta, a meat-eating lawyer
for an animal rights case!

42:04.515 --> 42:06.622
My client has made me
change my ways.

42:07.117 --> 42:09.259
Okay, what is this matter about?

42:09.587 --> 42:12.970
Well, this is about testing of
chemicals on animals.

42:13.524 --> 42:17.807
Pharmaceuticals companies in India
are constantly violating animal rights.

42:17.996 --> 42:22.450
Every ethical and scientific research
points to this having to stop.

42:23.302 --> 42:25.250
I know that may not
be possible now

42:25.671 --> 42:28.952
but what we are looking
at is the...

42:29.308 --> 42:32.451
complete elimination of cosmetic
and non-essential research.

42:32.645 --> 42:35.993
Okay, okay. That calls for a larger debate.
Who's appearing for the board!

42:36.182 --> 42:39.861
Your ladyship, we monitor

42:40.120 --> 42:43.127
And the report submitted by them
has been as per the guidelines.

42:43.323 --> 42:46.865
It is very difficult fol us to monitor
this on a day-to-day basis.

42:47.060 --> 42:49.839
These are my humble submissions
to this honorable court.

42:50.398 --> 42:54.214
My Lord, if this is the response of
the board then what remains in this petition?

42:55.036 --> 42:59.489
Public interest litigation nowadays, has
become more like "publicity" interest litigation.

42:59.673 --> 43:02.156
And this petition should be
rejected at this stage.

43:02.343 --> 43:05.351
Okay, okay. We'll hear from you, Mr. Gupta.
- Very well.

43:05.547 --> 43:08.588
The question is that animals
which are kept in laboratories...

43:08.817 --> 43:10.492
...they are treated completely ruthlessly.

43:10.685 --> 43:14.227
They're to be killed, they are to die,
and they are treated as dead.

43:14.422 --> 43:15.926
They are kept in cramped spaces

43:16.158 --> 43:18.037
they fight with each other,
they hurt each other.

43:18.227 --> 43:20.038
They get burnt, they get cut up

43:20.229 --> 43:22.212
they suffer from diarrhea, paralysis...

43:22.565 --> 43:23.943
the conditions are despicable!

43:24.167 --> 43:26.946
In fact, my learned friend
is not accurately instructed.

43:27.103 --> 43:31.214
We've recently installed air-conditioning
and ten by ten cages for these animals.

43:31.407 --> 43:33.856
Yes, but then you cram ten animals
in those ten by ten cages!

43:34.044 --> 43:35.548
Well, that's certainly more luxury than

43:35.746 --> 43:38.058
a commuter enjoys on a
suburban train in Mumbai!

43:38.248 --> 43:39.751
That was not warranted, Mr. Dastool!

43:40.017 --> 43:41.691
What I was trying to submit was...

43:42.086 --> 43:43.863
that there ale many
mole pressing issues

43:44.055 --> 43:46.196
which the court should
concern themselves with...

43:46.390 --> 43:48.394
rather than this sentimental petition.

43:49.126 --> 43:50.334
Okay, we'll heal from Ml. Gupta.

43:50.862 --> 43:52.810
My lord, the point really
is that molecules are

43:52.964 --> 43:55.447
required to be tested on
animals before they are

43:55.866 --> 43:57.142
used on human beings.

43:57.903 --> 43:58.939
Well, I don't know about that,

43:59.137 --> 44:00.446
because there's severe criticism

44:00.639 --> 44:03.919
of that within the
scientific community itself.

44:04.410 --> 44:06.084
Today, we have stem-cell research

44:06.279 --> 44:08.761
we have computer based research...
there are many other options.

44:08.947 --> 44:12.923
The point we are dealing with is the
conditions in which these animals ale kept

44:13.119 --> 44:14.759
and how they are treated.

45:01.337 --> 45:04.184
Sol heal your Guluji is in Boston now.

45:04.641 --> 45:09.356
He, like our beloved Maitreya, is
more an academic, less a monk.

45:09.879 --> 45:12.989
The fringe benefits of knowing English.

45:14.685 --> 45:18.033
The poster for the anti-leather campaign.
- Aah. It's good.

45:18.722 --> 45:20.897
Nice. Just cut down on
the sentimentality a bit.

45:21.225 --> 45:23.207
We must address people's reason mole.

45:27.298 --> 45:29.405
Have you forgotten your promise!

45:29.968 --> 45:35.652
It was your wish to sponsor a
community center for my guru.

45:36.341 --> 45:38.015
Wasn't it?

45:39.178 --> 45:43.187
All of you are so self absorbed.

45:43.415 --> 45:47.231
You have forgotten your duties.

45:51.090 --> 45:53.369
That's why I am reminding you

45:54.227 --> 45:59.079
of your promises of sponsorship

46:00.066 --> 46:05.248
and processions with great pomp.

46:06.172 --> 46:09.521
I will be a committed devotee,
once my son gets married.

46:09.776 --> 46:11.223
Shall we start?
- Yes... yes.

46:11.578 --> 46:16.693
Even Mr. Mahesh wishes to contribute.

46:17.552 --> 46:20.365
Feel free to start!

46:28.596 --> 46:34.781
There are no celestial beings I know of.

46:36.772 --> 46:38.811
There is no god either.

46:39.042 --> 46:42.549
Neither heaven, nor hell.

46:43.146 --> 46:48.500
Neither a preserver, nor an
owner of this universe.

46:50.387 --> 46:58.007
Neither a creator nor a destroyer.
No eternal judge.

46:58.996 --> 47:04.611
There is only the law of causality.

47:04.935 --> 47:09.941
I take responsibility for my actions
and their consequences.

47:17.015 --> 47:22.471
The smallest of creatures have
a life-force just like mine.

47:22.988 --> 47:30.882
May I always have such compassion.
May I never cause any harm to anybody.

47:31.430 --> 47:36.647
The truth is multi-faceted, and
there ale many ways to leach it.

47:37.670 --> 47:43.354
May I find balance in this duality.

47:43.977 --> 47:47.485
I pray, may my karma of ignorance be shed.

47:47.681 --> 47:55.836
May my true self be liberated from
the cycle of life and death.

47:56.024 --> 47:57.368
And attain moksha.

48:18.681 --> 48:20.720
So, I heal you are
a writer of jokes...

48:21.384 --> 48:23.696
No, as in, I have a stand-up
act which I write myself.

48:23.886 --> 48:27.030
Say something funny!
- That's like me saying, say something deep.

48:27.490 --> 48:28.435
I can be deep.

48:28.692 --> 48:34.478
See, once a monk went to a sandwich seller
and asked him, make me one with all!

48:38.335 --> 48:40.010
I have one which is
equally terrible.

48:40.204 --> 48:42.379
Which email can attain cyber
enlightenment?

48:42.606 --> 48:43.951
What does that mean!

48:45.910 --> 48:46.548
Which!

48:46.944 --> 48:48.391
One that has no attachment!

48:49.781 --> 48:53.426
I'm sorry, I'm just in this phase
of life where I find

48:53.751 --> 48:56.633
everything that comes with no
attachments lather fascinating.

48:57.455 --> 48:59.164
I read your book, by the way.
It was engaging.

48:59.391 --> 49:00.370
Oh! Thank you for reading it.

49:00.559 --> 49:02.700
I didn't buy it of course.
One of my friends lent it to me.

49:02.895 --> 49:05.504
But I have a few apprehensions.
- That's a good thing. Tell me.

49:06.599 --> 49:08.706
Like I haven't lead
the entire thing, but...

49:09.235 --> 49:11.012
the hundred and fifty
pages that I have read...

49:13.239 --> 49:17.624
you say you're an atheist, and at the same
time you believe in the concept of soul

49:18.044 --> 49:19.423
which I think is rather convenient.

49:19.813 --> 49:24.494
I don't think karmic causality is a reason
enough for anybody to behave ethically.

49:25.452 --> 49:28.493
You know, that there is
retribution of any kind

49:29.156 --> 49:31.104
in this life or any other

49:32.927 --> 49:36.105
It's like a weak man's hope for
some kind of cosmic revenge.

49:36.331 --> 49:39.781
I agree with you. It's very easy to believe
in something out of fear and guilt.

49:39.968 --> 49:40.469
Collect!

49:40.668 --> 49:43.778
All ethics must be arrived at in
isolation of religious beliefs.

49:44.239 --> 49:46.745
But are you able to practice that?
- I hope I am.

49:50.312 --> 49:52.316
Why do monks beg alms!

49:53.449 --> 49:55.796
Because hunger drives the world.

49:57.186 --> 49:58.633
And once that's out of the way

49:58.821 --> 50:00.426
there ale more important
things we can focus on.

50:00.623 --> 50:03.128
And also, it makes me
more patient and humble.

50:03.493 --> 50:04.700
Humble?
- Yes!

50:05.328 --> 50:05.806
Why!

50:06.762 --> 50:08.300
So will you be begging
my boss for food?

50:08.498 --> 50:11.345
No... but why did you
snigger at "humble"?

50:13.136 --> 50:14.411
I remembered something.

50:15.105 --> 50:17.554
No, rituals are symbolic theater. Once you
have accepted the symbol

50:17.708 --> 50:18.881
or the truth behind the symbol

50:19.109 --> 50:21.592
there is no need to stress
on it all the time.

50:22.012 --> 50:25.293
And you're expecting more people
to follow your religion!

50:25.549 --> 50:28.396
No, I am on no such mission.
- Okay, your ideas.

50:28.887 --> 50:30.162
Yes, I like to share them

50:30.622 --> 50:34.574
and see what comes out of it, but not
in religious discourses and conferences.

50:34.893 --> 50:38.071
I like to shale them with the
political and scientific mainstream.

50:39.331 --> 50:41.677
Something like the Copenhagen
Climate Change Summit?

50:42.034 --> 50:43.674
Yes. Why not!

50:44.570 --> 50:46.244
And will you walk to Copenhagen!

50:46.539 --> 50:47.518
Of course!

50:47.806 --> 50:53.091
Or you could keep walking inside
the plane, that way you'll reach...

50:57.350 --> 50:59.663
Ah, so you've found yourself
a new protege!

50:59.853 --> 51:02.131
Ah, he's the master.

51:04.658 --> 51:06.469
So, how did the interview go?

51:06.693 --> 51:08.072
Interview?

51:09.196 --> 51:11.736
He was on a talk show yesterday.
-Live? Did I miss something?

51:12.066 --> 51:13.672
No, not really.

51:14.168 --> 51:15.774
It's going to be broadcast
in a month or so, isn't it!

51:15.937 --> 51:20.083
Yes, it all started with the same assumption
of me being a naive romantic

51:20.275 --> 51:22.814
who is trying to imagine that the
world will tum vegan overnight.

51:23.044 --> 51:24.080
Well, don't you!

51:24.279 --> 51:25.988
Come on, who has these delusions?

51:26.749 --> 51:29.631
All that we have demanded is a
practical, reasonable, scientific

51:29.851 --> 51:31.890
change in the system so that
we can lessen suffering.

51:32.087 --> 51:34.866
You know, I secretly share
a part of their cynicism.

51:35.458 --> 51:37.064
I mean, does our case really hold?

51:37.260 --> 51:40.301
We're asking them to make the
cages bigger, to better the hygiene

51:40.529 --> 51:42.169
to stop the force feeding,
the torture

51:42.365 --> 51:45.247
but how does it make sense because they
ale all going to be butchered in the end!

51:45.435 --> 51:47.747
But let their lives be
better than their death.

51:47.937 --> 51:49.748
Yes. And just because they are
marked for slaughter

51:49.939 --> 51:52.149
doesn't mean you abuse and torture them.
What kind of logic is that?

51:52.809 --> 51:54.654
Tenzing Rinpoche was there yesterday.
- Really'!

51:54.879 --> 51:56.758
Yes. And I am joining him fol the
Peace March next month.

51:56.947 --> 51:59.829
Oh yes, I heard they ale protesting against
the visit of a Chinese ambassador.

52:00.050 --> 52:01.759
Yes, they are.

52:02.119 --> 52:03.259
What are you trying to do!

52:04.054 --> 52:07.232
Jagannath told me you had severe
pain in the abdomen yesterday.

52:07.959 --> 52:09.405
Why are you looking at him!

52:09.627 --> 52:11.302
You have loose motions as well!
- Nothing!

52:11.495 --> 52:12.976
And don't fool me into shelling
out money now.

52:13.164 --> 52:14.770
You don't have any. Just lie down.

52:15.066 --> 52:16.273
MI. Gupta! How are you!

52:19.471 --> 52:23.685
I've got your book.
The one you had ordered.

52:24.476 --> 52:25.649
Your liver is slightly enlarged.

52:25.845 --> 52:30.389
What is this discount for!
- It's for all my customers.

52:31.317 --> 52:33.322
Will you take medicines!
- N0.

52:35.188 --> 52:38.365
Okay, only if it will be necessary.
- Yes, it will be.

52:44.665 --> 52:47.342
Thank you MLMehta.
- Thank you very much.

53:09.291 --> 53:10.897
Who invited you here today'!

53:12.127 --> 53:17.446
I'm not here m see you.
I have other friends here.

53:26.509 --> 53:28.354
It's very good.

53:29.045 --> 53:30.354
(an I stop taking medicines now?

53:30.547 --> 53:35.365
Let the course complete.

53:48.366 --> 53:50.245
Here's your magazine.

53:55.007 --> 53:57.889
0h, wow... thank you!

53:58.510 --> 53:59.455
How ale you feeling!

53:59.945 --> 54:01.152
I'm better after taking
the herbal decoction.

54:01.380 --> 54:02.826
Decoction? What about the medicines!

54:03.081 --> 54:04.585
There was no need for medicines.

54:05.251 --> 54:07.028
I'll have m shut shop this way.

54:07.753 --> 54:09.200
See you later.
- Sit for a bit.

54:09.388 --> 54:11.597
Can't. Too much work.

54:12.859 --> 54:15.341
He says he's better with the herbs.

54:15.529 --> 54:17.374
What can we do!

54:39.387 --> 54:42.269
Sir, this case will take forever.

54:43.091 --> 54:44.470
We have our ways of doing things

54:44.660 --> 54:47.837
but I want to avoid
unpleasant situations.

54:48.497 --> 54:53.508
We'd be happy to make a donation to
a charity on your behalf.

54:54.904 --> 54:56.509
You know what you need to do.

56:18.326 --> 56:19.635
It's what I was afraid of.

56:21.063 --> 56:22.065
Liver cirrhosis.

56:22.998 --> 56:24.205
What's that? Eancel!

56:24.666 --> 56:26.306
No, it's not cancer.

56:27.368 --> 56:29.908
Cancel can be one of the
complications of cirrhosis.

56:30.339 --> 56:31.978
But we won't worry
about that at this stage.

56:32.174 --> 56:33.849
How much of the truth
will you tell me?

56:34.110 --> 56:35.454
The whole truth.

56:36.545 --> 56:40.497
So, should I prepare to end up here soon!
- No, nothing like that.

56:40.950 --> 56:44.834
See, cirrhosis has reached an
advanced stage.

56:45.622 --> 56:49.335
We'll be focusing on preventing
complications and getting a transplant.

56:50.094 --> 56:52.599
Transplant?
- Yes. It's imperative.

56:56.033 --> 56:57.537
That means lots of medication!

56:57.768 --> 56:58.440
YES-

56:58.803 --> 56:59.908
0f what kind?

58:31.201 --> 58:32.579
Iagannath, bring me the list please.

58:33.170 --> 58:35.652
You can have them. Dr. Bhargava
has prescribed these.

58:36.473 --> 58:37.748
Just bring me the list.

59:12.679 --> 59:14.490
It has three equivalents here.

59:14.781 --> 59:16.285
It's a very old list.

59:17.750 --> 59:18.889
We'll deal with it tomorrow.

59:44.380 --> 59:48.526
All the jungles have disappeared

59:50.486 --> 59:56.374
And we are trapped in cages

59:58.227 --> 01:00:00.267
It's going well!
- Thank you.

01:00:00.730 --> 01:00:03.008
They are traveling around with it.
- Ah! Okay.

01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:09.749
Ijust wanted afresh list of all the
companies that have not yet signed on the

01:00:10.506 --> 01:00:11.953
Illegal Treatment to Animals Act.

01:00:12.142 --> 01:00:13.521
There isn't a single
pharmaceutical company,

01:00:13.744 --> 01:00:15.919
that doesn't violate animal
testing guidelines,

01:00:16.180 --> 01:00:17.353
in one way or another.

01:00:19.317 --> 01:00:20.490
This one's pretty exhaustive.

01:00:20.684 --> 01:00:23.395
It's arranged according to the
brand names and formula patent.

01:00:24.856 --> 01:00:27.703
And here's the latest documentation.
You can take that as well.

01:00:31.163 --> 01:00:32.666
How is your case progressing?

01:00:33.265 --> 01:00:36.910
0h, it'll change a lot of things now.
Thank you so much.

01:00:38.704 --> 01:00:42.018
So, this is where you carry out
your Experiments with Truth?

01:00:42.608 --> 01:00:45.319
You know, this place leeks
of a violent past.

01:00:45.878 --> 01:00:47.882
Just convenient fol the community.

01:00:48.214 --> 01:00:50.321
It was the only place we
found on our way.

01:00:50.516 --> 01:00:52.795
This is the second time we
are in a biology lab this week.

01:00:52.986 --> 01:00:54.261
How ale you keeping!

01:00:54.788 --> 01:00:55.631
I'm alright.

01:00:57.524 --> 01:00:58.697
<i>Fastafaxian'.!</i>

01:00:59.393 --> 01:01:01.534
ls that a new joke?
- Not mine, and it's not a joke.

01:01:01.728 --> 01:01:03.539
It's a very serious religion
I follow!

01:01:04.631 --> 01:01:06.773
You know, I always knew
monks are closet drinkers

01:01:07.301 --> 01:01:09.807
but unfortunately liver cirrhosis
is going to give you away.

01:01:10.004 --> 01:01:13.147
You know it should have more to do with
intoxication than with drinking.

01:01:14.575 --> 01:01:17.057
We leave tomorrow...

01:01:17.245 --> 01:01:18.782
Why are you not taking medicines?

01:01:20.315 --> 01:01:21.317
Because there are no alternatives.

01:01:21.516 --> 01:01:22.724
Every medicine has animal
violence behind it.

01:01:22.918 --> 01:01:24.866
But how does your boycotting
make a difference!

01:01:25.053 --> 01:01:26.534
That way, nothing
makes a difference.

01:01:26.722 --> 01:01:28.863
Exactly! See, it's pretty clear
how inconsequential

01:01:29.057 --> 01:01:30.902
our actions are in the
larger scheme of things.

01:01:31.093 --> 01:01:32.768
I am not convinced.

01:01:33.395 --> 01:01:37.940
Every molecule in the universe is
affected by our actions.

01:01:38.434 --> 01:01:40.713
That is the truth or else
everything is meaningless.

01:01:41.104 --> 01:01:42.779
What is the sense of
existence then?

01:01:43.373 --> 01:01:45.912
The hedonism and nihilism of
your namesake, Chalvaka!

01:01:48.445 --> 01:01:52.397
So, your worldview provides
you with meaning... purpose?

01:01:52.615 --> 01:01:53.652
See, we are dualists.

01:01:54.218 --> 01:01:55.893
If you were to ask me if life
is perpetual or temporary,

01:01:56.086 --> 01:01:57.465
I would say, it's both.

01:01:57.955 --> 01:02:00.302
Temporary for the body
and infinite for the soul.

01:02:00.558 --> 01:02:02.506
The soul is formless, shapeless,
it's non-matter...

01:02:02.693 --> 01:02:05.540
And it connects to the world
through the body...

01:02:05.730 --> 01:02:08.339
and every minute action, even inaction,

01:02:08.533 --> 01:02:11.142
leaves behind a karmic
record on the soul.

01:02:12.437 --> 01:02:14.316
And the purpose of our
existence is

01:02:14.573 --> 01:02:16.919
enlightenment and eventual liberation

01:02:17.109 --> 01:02:18.920
from the perpetual suffering
of life and death.

01:02:19.111 --> 01:02:21.958
Okay, so then why is it so
important m not kill?

01:02:22.715 --> 01:02:26.393
I mean, if you kill an animal, it's probably
going to come back, perhaps happier.

01:02:26.586 --> 01:02:29.536
Freedom of choice and light of consent
is the core of our world view.

01:02:29.722 --> 01:02:33.937
What about killing by consent?
- I-low do you judge the validity of consent?

01:02:37.731 --> 01:02:39.109
What about the violence
that you are

01:02:39.299 --> 01:02:41.578
committing on yourself by
not taking medication?

01:02:42.269 --> 01:02:43.477
How is your choice
a choice of sanity!

01:02:43.671 --> 01:02:46.017
How is it not different
from a suicide bomber

01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:48.080
who is so convinced about
the fundamentalism

01:02:48.276 --> 01:02:49.916
of his political and religious thoughts?

01:02:50.979 --> 01:02:52.618
Are you really making
that analogy?

01:02:54.749 --> 01:02:55.785
What happened?

01:02:56.618 --> 01:02:58.759
See, I am not good at this
but I am going to try.

01:03:00.422 --> 01:03:04.203
There are a lot of people who love you,
respect you and need you including myself.

01:03:04.860 --> 01:03:07.742
I know you're a rational, open minded
person so I can only suggest...

01:03:08.463 --> 01:03:09.569
Please take care of yourself.

01:03:09.965 --> 01:03:10.671
O
I wnll.

01:03:13.101 --> 01:03:14.137
I'll see you later then.

01:03:14.970 --> 01:03:15.676
Stay for a while.

01:03:16.005 --> 01:03:16.677
NO.

01:09:50.591 --> 01:09:52.939
You know, one of my friends
interns at Munshi and lal.

01:09:53.529 --> 01:09:56.137
I think you've mentioned of him before.
ls he good! - No.

01:09:56.532 --> 01:10:00.814
But this comes from him. Apparently, they used
some local muscle to threaten Maitreya.

01:10:00.971 --> 01:10:01.950
What! When!

01:10:02.405 --> 01:10:04.080
A little while ago.
It was a soft call.

01:10:04.374 --> 01:10:07.825
They studied his routine
for a couple of days

01:10:08.111 --> 01:10:10.321
and then they tried to comer him
on one of the rainy nights

01:10:10.548 --> 01:10:12.359
when he was just beginning
his walk to the court.

01:10:12.550 --> 01:10:15.591
The partners of the firm were very
angry with their client for doing this.

01:10:15.786 --> 01:10:18.655
Now, what I am surprised about is that Maitreya
hasn't mentioned any of this to any of us.

01:10:18.656 --> 01:10:19.397
Now, what I am surprised about is that Maitreya
hasn't mentioned any of this to any of us.

01:10:19.991 --> 01:10:23.032
He's not going to mention it.
For all you know, he won't even remember.

01:10:23.962 --> 01:10:25.602
What exactly did
Jagannath say!

01:10:25.797 --> 01:10:28.144
Just what I told you
over the phone.

01:10:28.567 --> 01:10:32.075
That he has stopped eating,
and he rarely speaks.

01:10:33.105 --> 01:10:36.642
Jagannath believes that Maitreya has
taken Sansal Bhava Bhagga vow!

01:10:36.643 --> 01:10:36.677
Jagannath believes that Maitreya has
taken Sansal Bhava Bhagga vow!

01:10:36.976 --> 01:10:38.012
What is that!

01:10:38.844 --> 01:10:41.019
It's an ancient custom in
his religion.

01:10:41.247 --> 01:10:44.026
A monk ailing from an
untreatable disease

01:10:44.450 --> 01:10:47.662
can make peace with himself and
choose to withdraw from life.

01:10:47.955 --> 01:10:49.230
How do you withdraw from life?

01:10:50.090 --> 01:10:52.038
It's one way of saying
fast unto death.

01:10:52.192 --> 01:10:53.673
Fast unto death!
That's extreme!

01:10:54.461 --> 01:10:54.594
But, his liver cirrhosis is
treatable, right!

01:10:54.595 --> 01:10:56.270
But, his liver cirrhosis is
treatable, right!

01:10:56.464 --> 01:10:57.808
Not the way he prefers it.

01:10:57.998 --> 01:10:59.502
I don't get this idea
of karma.

01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:01.406
Does the intention not matter
at all!

01:11:01.602 --> 01:11:05.247
The experiments are not being conducted
with the intention of inflicting pain...

01:11:05.439 --> 01:11:07.318
but the intention of
relieving pain.

01:11:08.510 --> 01:11:12.613
You see, in his world, it's not all humanity
that's equal, it's all existence that's equal.

01:11:12.614 --> 01:11:14.152
You see, in his world, it's not all humanity
that's equal, it's all existence that's equal.

01:11:14.449 --> 01:11:19.335
But, anyway, keep working on it. We'll need
ideas like these before we can make him budge.

01:11:25.528 --> 01:11:26.371
There was an island...

01:11:27.196 --> 01:11:29.872
and you were to be reborn
as a tormentor or a slave.

01:11:30.466 --> 01:11:30.565
The tormentor would make
life hell for you.

01:11:30.566 --> 01:11:32.309
The tormentor would make
life hell for you.

01:11:32.969 --> 01:11:36.511
He will give infinite pain to you
and your kin, just for his pleasure.

01:11:38.241 --> 01:11:42.888
And... he had no remorse
over his actions to crush his victim.

01:11:43.714 --> 01:11:48.429
Add to that there was no
karma, no soul, no retribution...

01:11:50.254 --> 01:11:52.737
no being responsible
for your actions.

01:11:53.891 --> 01:11:56.568
And you had to choose
any one of them. Who would you be!

01:11:57.728 --> 01:11:59.175
You do realize that you're
going to give up your life,

01:11:59.397 --> 01:12:01.572
for something that is nothing
mole than a thought experiment!

01:12:05.003 --> 01:12:05.641
And...

01:12:06.404 --> 01:12:06.436
monks are supposed to
be celibate, right!

01:12:06.437 --> 01:12:08.077
Monks are supposed to
be celibate, right!

01:12:08.441 --> 01:12:12.393
So, I don't understand why there is so much
intellectual masturbation in the first place!

01:12:13.779 --> 01:12:15.454
Look into your own religion.

01:12:15.781 --> 01:12:17.626
There's constant reference
to relativity.

01:12:18.350 --> 01:12:19.193
Your ancients...

01:12:20.119 --> 01:12:21.326
they were masters of understanding...

01:12:21.554 --> 01:12:23.889
that there is no one ultimate
rule book for all situations.

01:12:23.890 --> 01:12:24.231
That there is no one ultimate
rule book for all situations.

01:12:24.891 --> 01:12:27.397
The woman churning
curd into butter...

01:12:28.562 --> 01:12:30.407
she has to pull one
end of the lope

01:12:30.763 --> 01:12:33.372
and let the other end go
otherwise the rope will bleak.

01:12:33.934 --> 01:12:37.043
Contradictions and polarities are
two ends of the same rope.

01:12:38.138 --> 01:12:40.587
You pull one end and
let the other end go.

01:12:41.209 --> 01:12:41.908
Yes, it's very convenient to
hold on to one lope

01:12:41.909 --> 01:12:43.584
Yes, it's very convenient to
hold on to one lope

01:12:43.811 --> 01:12:46.351
and let the other one lose
as and when you feel like.

01:12:47.716 --> 01:12:49.390
I guess we all agree
with reason...

01:12:51.319 --> 01:12:53.164
now it's only a
matter of disposition.

01:17:03.221 --> 01:17:04.531
Keep sleeping.

01:17:04.756 --> 01:17:05.701
How ale you feeling!

01:17:05.891 --> 01:17:06.893
Fantastic.

01:17:07.526 --> 01:17:08.505
Are you up for some banter?

01:17:08.694 --> 01:17:09.639
Always.

01:17:10.262 --> 01:17:11.241
<i>L EM you a gift.</i>

01:17:15.167 --> 01:17:15.873
Alphabet.

01:17:21.173 --> 01:17:22.552
It's amazing how we imagine

01:17:23.343 --> 01:17:26.691
that someday these few alphabets will
just arrange themselves in a way

01:17:26.946 --> 01:17:27.947
that suddenly everything
will make perfect sense.

01:17:27.948 --> 01:17:29.451
That suddenly everything
will make perfect sense.

01:17:29.683 --> 01:17:30.891
A permutation of known words...

01:17:31.084 --> 01:17:33.532
suddenly bringing forward a
previously unknown meaning.

01:17:35.255 --> 01:17:39.436
It's so oppressive, this obsession
with final answers.

01:17:40.794 --> 01:17:45.806
We invent god, soul, heaven, afterlife,
even life-imitating technology...

01:17:46.801 --> 01:17:50.274
all sons of transcendence to cope
with the idea of an absolute end.

01:17:51.940 --> 01:17:56.223
And then, we die for an idea, which
promises some sort of immortality.

01:18:03.953 --> 01:18:04.052
It gives me some kicks
though, to know that

01:18:04.053 --> 01:18:06.434
It gives me some kicks
though, to know that

01:18:06.756 --> 01:18:09.535
a part of me was a part of
an animal once...

01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:11.697
aﬂame, a star.

01:18:12.395 --> 01:18:13.534
A part will become mineral,

01:18:13.930 --> 01:18:15.308
flow in a plant, sprout in a fruit,

01:18:15.498 --> 01:18:17.036
get pecked by a bird.

01:18:18.635 --> 01:18:22.017
Every atom of my body
recycled by the universe.

01:18:23.407 --> 01:18:25.787
You think you're a person
but you're a colony.

01:18:26.610 --> 01:18:29.788
A microcosm, which has ten times
more bacteria in its body

01:18:30.081 --> 01:18:31.288
than it has human cells.

01:18:32.183 --> 01:18:33.322
Here, check this out.

01:18:39.357 --> 01:18:39.956
U for Unilateralis Cordyceps.

01:18:39.957 --> 01:18:41.768
U for Unilateralis Cordyceps.

01:18:43.361 --> 01:18:46.072
The fungus enters an ant's
body through its respiration.

01:18:46.699 --> 01:18:49.204
It invades it's brain and changes
how it perceives smell...

01:18:49.535 --> 01:18:52.712
because ants do everything they do
from their smell of pheromones, right?

01:18:52.972 --> 01:18:54.647
So this microscopic little
fungal spore

01:18:54.840 --> 01:18:57.542
then makes the ant climb up the stem
of a plant and bite hard on a leaf

01:18:57.543 --> 01:18:57.954
then makes the ant climb up the stem
of a plant and bite hard on a leaf

01:18:58.144 --> 01:18:59.351
with an abnormal force.

01:19:00.146 --> 01:19:02.595
The fungus then kills the ant,
and continues to glow

01:19:03.116 --> 01:19:05.098
leaving the aunt's exoskeleton intact.

01:19:05.719 --> 01:19:10.035
So, a small fungus drives an ant around
as a vehicle, uses it as food and shelter

01:19:10.224 --> 01:19:12.399
and then as the ultimate monument to itself.

01:19:13.227 --> 01:19:15.072
And when the fungus is ready to reproduce

01:19:15.295 --> 01:19:15.628
it's fruiting bodies grow from
the aunt's head and rupture

01:19:15.629 --> 01:19:18.112
it's fruiting bodies grow from
the aunt's head and rupture

01:19:18.566 --> 01:19:22.541
releasing the spores, letting the wind
carry them to more unsuspecting food.

01:19:23.838 --> 01:19:24.476
There...

01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:28.249
our entire idea of flee
will down the bin.

01:19:29.710 --> 01:19:32.319
One single small fungus
spore does that to an ant.

01:19:32.981 --> 01:19:33.515
You have trillions of bacteria
in your body.

01:19:33.516 --> 01:19:35.155
You have trillions of bacteria
in your body.

01:19:36.184 --> 01:19:37.220
How do you know
where you end...

01:19:37.419 --> 01:19:39.230
and where your
environment begins!

01:20:15.593 --> 01:20:18.202
Sir, please tell me...

01:20:18.564 --> 01:20:20.341
Do we really have souls!

01:20:27.573 --> 01:20:28.952
Sir, please tell me

01:20:30.642 --> 01:20:31.519
I don't know.

01:22:03.174 --> 01:22:06.648
Why am I tied?

01:22:08.581 --> 01:22:09.526
Do you need something!

01:22:09.748 --> 01:22:10.727
Call my mother.

01:22:13.753 --> 01:22:14.219
Please try to understand.

01:22:14.220 --> 01:22:16.031
Please try to understand.

01:22:24.764 --> 01:22:25.938
Is that you, Jagannath?

01:22:27.167 --> 01:22:30.778
Are you okay?
-Yes. How are you feeling?

01:22:31.504 --> 01:22:32.238
Are you mocking me!

01:22:32.239 --> 01:22:32.741
Are you mocking me!

01:22:34.609 --> 01:22:36.716
What are you saying?

01:22:39.914 --> 01:22:41.122
How much time do we have?

01:22:41.349 --> 01:22:42.693
For what?

01:23:34.506 --> 01:23:35.611
Jagannath...

01:23:39.577 --> 01:23:40.386
Yes, sir!

01:23:49.187 --> 01:23:50.827
Call Doctor Bhalgava.

01:23:54.827 --> 01:23:57.436
Tell him I agree.

01:24:03.036 --> 01:24:05.679
I am not ready to go yet.

01:25:37.404 --> 01:25:39.181
The price is still low.

01:25:39.639 --> 01:25:42.088
What was at 1200 is now 30o.

01:25:43.877 --> 01:25:45.221
One second.

01:25:46.947 --> 01:25:47.949
Yes, sir.

01:25:51.785 --> 01:25:53.460
Bro!

01:25:55.756 --> 01:25:57.739
<i>W: a debit of Rs. 350,000.</i>

01:25:59.994 --> 01:26:02.169
Sir, can I collect the cheque tomorrow?

01:26:02.764 --> 01:26:06.215
You won't get these prices in the market.

01:26:07.902 --> 01:26:09.577
Okay, I'll wait for your call.

01:26:10.672 --> 01:26:12.780
Did you ask when we can leave?
- Today!

01:26:13.341 --> 01:26:16.519
Of course. Ask today!
- I mean we can leave today.

01:26:17.346 --> 01:26:18.850
Who told you!
- The nurse.

01:26:19.415 --> 01:26:21.294
Who told her?
- I-low would I know?

01:26:21.784 --> 01:26:24.495
She said your reports are alright,
your creatinine levels seem normal.

01:26:24.687 --> 01:26:27.068
Get the discharge papers, and leave.
- tan I take these off now!

01:26:27.957 --> 01:26:28.936
Maybe.

01:26:29.793 --> 01:26:33.175
Trust you to never
get propel answers.

01:26:33.663 --> 01:26:34.665
What are you watching!

01:26:34.998 --> 01:26:37.447
It's the same channel repeated all through.

01:26:37.767 --> 01:26:40.250
Idiot! Only 1, z, 3 and 8h
are the same. Here!

01:26:41.205 --> 01:26:42.686
What else did the nurse say'!

01:26:43.473 --> 01:26:44.475
Rest is private.

01:26:44.676 --> 01:26:46.680
Oi! Private chat! You bitch...

01:26:47.344 --> 01:26:48.689
Naveen!

01:26:48.879 --> 01:26:50.485
What are you guys up to?
- Nothing, sir!

01:26:50.815 --> 01:26:53.799
How ale you feeling today'!
- Perfect! May I leave today'!

01:26:54.052 --> 01:26:56.261
Let me check first.

01:27:01.026 --> 01:27:02.131
(an I take this off.'

01:27:02.461 --> 01:27:05.809
Sure. Nurse, help him.
Else he'll carry it home!

01:27:06.398 --> 01:27:08.380
Sir, come home sometime.

01:27:11.637 --> 01:27:16.524
I've been to your house plenty of times.
- Not since I moved to Mumbai.

01:27:17.076 --> 01:27:18.921
Yeah...

01:27:19.379 --> 01:27:20.654
How is your grandmother?

01:27:20.847 --> 01:27:21.553
She's great.

01:27:21.748 --> 01:27:24.254
Thanks to her, you've recovered
so soon.

01:27:24.551 --> 01:27:25.030
YES-

01:27:25.218 --> 01:27:26.323
What do you call her!
- Ajji!

01:27:26.520 --> 01:27:28.833
“Hiiz
' “iii.

01:27:29.056 --> 01:27:30.263
<i>Even we say 'Mai? 'm Marathi'!?</i>

01:27:30.491 --> 01:27:31.835
In Rajasthan, we say
'Baasah'...

01:27:32.025 --> 01:27:32.800
but I call he! Ajji.

01:27:32.993 --> 01:27:34.166
You speak Kannada!

01:27:34.662 --> 01:27:35.698
Not really.

01:27:35.896 --> 01:27:38.903
Mom used it only when
she was angry.

01:27:39.334 --> 01:27:42.147
So you've learnt the curses!
- Just the curses.

01:27:42.537 --> 01:27:45.214
Your grandmother speaks so many
languages... even Spanish.

01:27:45.907 --> 01:27:47.114
But she doesn't speak Marwali!

01:28:23.247 --> 01:28:26.060
When Mannu got the discharge
papers done

01:28:26.818 --> 01:28:28.526
I called some friends over.

01:28:29.087 --> 01:28:31.035
I thought we'd throw a party for you.

01:28:31.956 --> 01:28:33.960
Why don't you call some
of your friends!

01:28:34.792 --> 01:28:36.740
I don't have any friends
here in Mumbai.

01:28:38.730 --> 01:28:41.441
Mukhtiyal Ali is in the city.

01:28:42.467 --> 01:28:43.812
I have invited him too.

01:28:44.002 --> 01:28:45.711
Do you like his music!

01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:50.189
Even he is from Rajasthan.

01:28:50.443 --> 01:28:52.118
lam sure you must have
heard his music.

01:28:53.179 --> 01:28:54.854
No... never got a chance.

01:28:59.185 --> 01:29:01.133
How are you Raju?
- I'm good... and you, brothel!

01:29:01.321 --> 01:29:02.324
Great!

01:29:02.989 --> 01:29:04.334
I will join you in a moment.

01:29:06.760 --> 01:29:08.970
I had invited Ill. Kelkal as well

01:29:09.163 --> 01:29:11.611
but he is tied up with work.

01:29:13.100 --> 01:29:14.307
Did you get along with him?

01:29:14.535 --> 01:29:15.138
<i>Y“!</i>

01:29:16.371 --> 01:29:17.817
He speaks highly of you.

01:29:18.373 --> 01:29:20.753
He used to write revolutionary songs!
- Dr. Kerkal'!

01:29:20.975 --> 01:29:21.579
<i>Y“!</i>

01:29:22.044 --> 01:29:24.583
Just like your friend who had come
to see me at the hospital?

01:29:25.113 --> 01:29:26.058
YES-

01:29:26.682 --> 01:29:28.994
Did you lead her book?

01:29:29.518 --> 01:29:31.522
No... didn't get the time.

01:29:32.287 --> 01:29:35.602
When she gave you the book,
she asked if you would read it.

01:29:36.058 --> 01:29:37.037
Then, why did you say you would?

01:29:37.293 --> 01:29:40.801
Ilow can I say no when
she's offering me her book?

01:29:41.363 --> 01:29:42.867
She'll be here in the evening.

01:29:43.232 --> 01:29:45.111
Tell he! the truth if she asks.

01:29:46.068 --> 01:29:48.278
Don't make alibis like
not having had the time.

01:29:49.005 --> 01:29:49.711
Okay;

01:29:53.977 --> 01:29:54.820
Wait a second.

01:29:55.245 --> 01:29:57.193
The address is light here...
it's on the poster.

01:29:58.081 --> 01:30:02.694
It's not .net, it's .edu. E-D-U

01:30:03.887 --> 01:30:05.988
Yeah... I'm sorry.

01:30:05.989 --> 01:30:06.000
Yeah... I'm sorry.

01:30:07.425 --> 01:30:09.202
You got it light?

01:30:19.037 --> 01:30:20.313
Hey! How are you?

01:30:20.572 --> 01:30:21.711
I'm good, how ale you?

01:30:22.007 --> 01:30:23.646
I'm good. How are you feeling now?

01:30:24.509 --> 01:30:25.488
I'm perfectly fine now.

01:30:25.711 --> 01:30:26.554
What are you up
to these days!

01:30:27.179 --> 01:30:28.558
Lot of things have been happening.

01:30:28.748 --> 01:30:32.564
An activist has been
imprisoned in Chattisgalh

01:30:33.085 --> 01:30:34.862
for baseless charges...
- Navin Sir!

01:32:11.523 --> 01:32:14.234
Sexalia wants to meet us.
- It's Sekhselia, not 'Sexarir!

01:32:14.527 --> 01:32:16.668
Yamamoto guys coming along!
- IIO...

01:32:16.863 --> 01:32:18.640
But, he will give us the
cheque today.

01:32:21.134 --> 01:32:23.742
Where do we meet!
Your office has been hijacked.

01:32:31.011 --> 01:32:32.047
So, who did you vote fol!

01:32:32.246 --> 01:32:35.059
You don't have to answer that!
I-low can you ask?!

01:32:35.249 --> 01:32:36.251
I didn't vote.

01:32:36.717 --> 01:32:41.193
My deal grandson is only interested in
money not in the world around.

01:32:41.556 --> 01:32:43.094
At least someone
is interested in money.

01:32:43.324 --> 01:32:46.502
If everyone is bloke like us,
who'll pay our pensions!

01:32:55.838 --> 01:32:59.050
So, you like the college type!
Take this number down.

01:32:59.542 --> 01:33:01.421
Might come handy.
- No! Nothing like that.

01:33:01.611 --> 01:33:04.959
I'll take it...
for a lonely night!

01:33:05.215 --> 01:33:06.820
What about the Yamamoto meeting!

01:33:08.018 --> 01:33:08.793
YES-

01:33:13.089 --> 01:33:14.068
They've sent a cheque.

01:33:19.296 --> 01:33:20.401
This says 28th.

01:33:20.965 --> 01:33:22.104
The coming 28th.

01:33:22.867 --> 01:33:24.211
That one is hilarious!

01:33:25.369 --> 01:33:27.214
How's grandma now!
- She's fine.

01:33:27.906 --> 01:33:30.286
Tell me if you need any help -
legal... not so legal.

01:33:31.376 --> 01:33:32.651
I have connections up to Rao.

01:33:33.311 --> 01:33:34.985
Rao?
- State home minister!

01:33:35.213 --> 01:33:36.022
0h, light!

01:33:36.215 --> 01:33:38.094
(an I forward this?
- Sure.

01:34:03.277 --> 01:34:05.782
Will you call fol a nurse!

01:34:06.246 --> 01:34:08.023
I rang the bell a few times.

01:34:26.835 --> 01:34:28.372
(an you send a nurse
please?

01:34:28.604 --> 01:34:31.417
They're all busy in the
operation theatre.

01:34:32.107 --> 01:34:35.615
What about you?
- I am busy.

01:34:50.227 --> 01:34:53.074
No one': free.
Do you need to pee?

01:34:54.164 --> 01:34:56.146
I wanted to, but I'll wait.

01:34:56.333 --> 01:34:57.609
I'll help you.

01:34:59.036 --> 01:35:00.813
No, I can wait for a bit.

01:35:01.305 --> 01:35:04.846
They'll take at least half an hour.

01:35:25.665 --> 01:35:28.979
You're so liberal-minded,
then why are you feeling embarrassed!

01:38:12.743 --> 01:38:15.750
Saying that I am ignorant and
uneducated is one thing...

01:38:16.614 --> 01:38:19.997
but if you call me a sucker
for money wouldn't it hurt?

01:38:21.953 --> 01:38:23.558
I challenge you...

01:38:25.022 --> 01:38:28.405
only so you learn to live.

01:38:28.626 --> 01:38:31.166
Your way of looking at life cannot
be the only way, can it?

01:38:31.463 --> 01:38:33.570
Okay, then tell me your idea of living!

01:38:33.865 --> 01:38:38.512
I eat well, drink well... people
around me respect me.

01:38:39.471 --> 01:38:41.647
Is that enough?
- It's good enough for me.

01:38:43.476 --> 01:38:45.480
Life is so magnificent.

01:38:46.145 --> 01:38:49.493
There is so much to explore.
- I'm not interested!

01:38:49.815 --> 01:38:51.820
Does that make me a bad person?

01:38:52.618 --> 01:38:55.728
If you don't want to understand,
then don't talk rubbish.

01:38:56.222 --> 01:38:58.569
So, you tell me
What does one need in life!

01:38:58.925 --> 01:39:01.374
Happiness...
and some compassion...

01:39:01.662 --> 01:39:02.869
Isn't that enough!

01:39:03.998 --> 01:39:04.977
It's enough, yes.

01:39:05.799 --> 01:39:07.678
You can't reduce it to 'good' or 'bad'.

01:39:09.336 --> 01:39:13.380
It's about experiencing the entire
spectrum of thought and emotion

01:39:13.608 --> 01:39:15.111
about connecting with society.

01:39:15.610 --> 01:39:17.285
But, I am compassionate!

01:39:18.279 --> 01:39:21.729
You don't even know who
needs your compassion

01:39:23.018 --> 01:39:26.059
or what consequences your actions have.

01:39:27.322 --> 01:39:30.330
What is the point of such compassion!

01:39:30.626 --> 01:39:34.009
Society should benefit from
your existence!

01:39:34.197 --> 01:39:36.076
This is exactly what ticked off mom.

01:39:36.598 --> 01:39:39.047
All this idealistic jargon from
your pretentious friends!

01:39:39.434 --> 01:39:41.211
Another misunderstanding!

01:39:42.271 --> 01:39:46.884
They weren't pretentious.

01:39:47.511 --> 01:39:48.456
They were activists!

01:39:48.678 --> 01:39:52.562
Sacrificing one's life for a cause
is a huge expectation from anyone.

01:39:52.950 --> 01:39:57.802
See, this is why I don't
persuade you.

01:39:58.856 --> 01:40:01.339
Like I might have done with your mother.

01:40:01.825 --> 01:40:03.170
She was blessed with everything.

01:40:04.495 --> 01:40:05.497
But did she shale anything!

01:40:05.696 --> 01:40:08.681
And how have you
changed the world!

01:40:08.867 --> 01:40:11.406
When the nation was fighting for freedom
you'd leave mom with the neighbours

01:40:11.703 --> 01:40:13.981
and go off spreading condom
awareness in villages...

01:40:14.306 --> 01:40:16.117
Was that your revolution!

01:40:16.308 --> 01:40:18.951
If your work had made any difference, then
where did these billion people come from?!

01:40:19.145 --> 01:40:22.652
We've been fighting slavery and
repression for three generations...

01:40:22.849 --> 01:40:27.667
just to see my grandson
be a slave to the Americans?

01:40:27.853 --> 01:40:30.393
Have you gone senile!
These foreign companies are my clients!

01:40:30.590 --> 01:40:32.469
Look at your manners!

01:40:34.194 --> 01:40:36.837
Calling your own grandmother senile!

01:40:37.030 --> 01:40:38.203
Okay, I apologize.

01:40:38.398 --> 01:40:41.781
We'll confront this when one
of us understands the other.

01:40:42.002 --> 01:40:44.315
The country was
independent by then.

01:40:44.605 --> 01:40:48.147
Get your history light!
- Mannu! Take care of Ajji for a while.

01:40:48.609 --> 01:40:49.919
But what will I do in there?

01:40:50.178 --> 01:40:53.128
Shall I ask her to recommend me a book!
- Ale you crazy!

01:40:53.281 --> 01:40:54.921
She will cross examine
you for every page.

01:41:05.060 --> 01:41:07.907
Why are you watching this?
It's only on 1, 2, 3 and 84.

01:41:08.197 --> 01:41:09.176
Here!

01:42:35.623 --> 01:42:36.933
Has someone died!

01:42:37.358 --> 01:42:39.967
Her husband, poor guy, got fucked, man!
- What happened?

01:42:40.161 --> 01:42:43.271
He got his appendix operated
a month ago at some shady hospital.

01:42:43.799 --> 01:42:47.307
Got back to work in a couple of days...
he's a laborer.

01:42:47.502 --> 01:42:50.885
Collapsed, yesterday, on site.
His boss admitted him here.

01:42:51.507 --> 01:42:53.717
When they operated him again, they
found a kidney missing.

01:42:53.909 --> 01:42:54.786
What do you mean?

01:42:55.812 --> 01:42:58.124
When they opened him
up for the appendix

01:42:58.315 --> 01:42:59.761
they also ﬂicked his kidney.

01:43:00.250 --> 01:43:01.059
But how!

01:43:01.418 --> 01:43:04.801
It happens all the time in
those shady hospitals!

01:43:08.725 --> 01:43:10.934
Please go and ask her
the date of the operation.

01:43:11.395 --> 01:43:14.743
What the hell man?
Look at the ﬂight of stairs!

01:43:15.199 --> 01:43:16.838
Please.

01:43:17.434 --> 01:43:18.311
Oh man!

01:43:58.545 --> 01:44:00.083
The 16th of last month.

01:44:01.249 --> 01:44:02.558
When was yours?

01:44:03.450 --> 01:44:04.829
On the 17th.

01:44:07.889 --> 01:44:11.670
Find out his blood group.
- Again these stairs?

01:44:34.350 --> 01:44:35.888
Same as yours.

01:45:02.846 --> 01:45:04.886
Excuse me!
Which ward is Shankal in?

01:45:05.116 --> 01:45:07.120
Shankal who!
- The guy who got operated yesterday.

01:45:07.318 --> 01:45:09.961
His wife was crying, remember!
- He got discharged.

01:45:10.955 --> 01:45:13.962
But he was only operated yesterday.
- Yes, but he got discharged.

01:45:14.960 --> 01:45:16.441
(an I have his address!

01:45:16.996 --> 01:45:17.975
Wait.

01:45:29.542 --> 01:45:30.419
Hello Navin!

01:45:32.245 --> 01:45:35.024
Sir, the kidney, I've received...
Are you sure it's from a dead man?

01:45:35.215 --> 01:45:39.395
Of course! There are only two ways.
Either from a brain dead patient...

01:45:39.586 --> 01:45:40.930
or a family member.

01:45:44.925 --> 01:45:45.962
<i>S0...</i>

01:45:46.326 --> 01:45:48.501
can I get some information
about my donor'!

01:45:50.098 --> 01:45:52.911
I'll connect you to an N60.

01:45:53.101 --> 01:45:54.776
You can take it from there.

01:45:55.002 --> 01:45:56.881
They hold community meetings
between donors and recipients.

01:45:57.071 --> 01:45:59.782
Here, keep their card.

01:46:02.511 --> 01:46:04.824
The doctor confirmed that you didn't
get your kidney from that guy.

01:46:05.014 --> 01:46:06.221
Then, why do we need to meet him now!

01:46:06.682 --> 01:46:08.321
How do we know what's going on?

01:46:08.951 --> 01:46:11.491
I'll feel better once I clarify it
with the IIG0.

01:46:14.390 --> 01:46:17.237
And what if you discover you
have a stolen kidney'!

01:46:17.894 --> 01:46:18.930
I'll return it.

01:46:21.798 --> 01:46:23.575
Look ahead...
- Wait... wait!

01:46:24.901 --> 01:46:25.903
Have you lost it?

01:46:26.303 --> 01:46:28.307
Who returns a transplanted kidney'!

01:46:28.605 --> 01:46:31.111
- Isn't it possible?
"NO.

01:46:31.542 --> 01:46:33.581
The car won't squeeze through...

01:46:39.717 --> 01:46:41.665
Then what about you!
- I'll wait it out.

01:46:45.590 --> 01:46:46.865
It will jam against the wall.

01:46:50.095 --> 01:46:51.974
One second. let me check.

01:46:55.967 --> 01:46:58.074
Pull back...
- Ale you crazy!

01:46:58.304 --> 01:47:00.081
There's no space here, pull back.

01:47:03.509 --> 01:47:04.956
Let's palm him some money, then!

01:47:07.847 --> 01:47:08.883
But, that's wrong!

01:47:20.094 --> 01:47:23.101
Yes... Ves... Okay...
Okay... Thank you.

01:47:23.797 --> 01:47:25.335
You satisfied now!

01:47:26.100 --> 01:47:27.740
Yeah, the N60 says my
kidney is from a legit source.

01:47:27.935 --> 01:47:29.712
Lets get back m
the hospital than!

01:47:30.105 --> 01:47:30.776
Listen!

01:47:32.140 --> 01:47:34.088
Now that were here
let's meet him.

01:47:57.400 --> 01:47:58.937
Should I get us two coupons?

01:48:01.571 --> 01:48:03.553
Where is Shankar': house!

01:48:08.979 --> 01:48:14.298
Two buildings after Sachin's building
...light ahead.

01:48:15.686 --> 01:48:17.690
Wow! You have 46 here!
- Shut up.

01:48:33.105 --> 01:48:35.109
(an you draw us a map?

01:48:54.928 --> 01:48:56.204
Is this Shankal': house?

01:48:56.697 --> 01:48:58.201
Must be on the other
side, then.

01:48:59.800 --> 01:49:01.679
This way.
Where are you going!

01:49:03.637 --> 01:49:05.346
Where?
- No, he stays there...

01:49:05.573 --> 01:49:06.746
The snack-seller, light?

01:49:07.107 --> 01:49:09.989
Not the snack-seller!
The bricklayer.

01:49:11.946 --> 01:49:13.051
Careful.

01:49:23.659 --> 01:49:25.504
How do they walk up all these stairs!

01:49:35.772 --> 01:49:36.911
It's on the sea-link.

01:49:38.107 --> 01:49:39.452
Looks like he lives
there now!

01:49:44.681 --> 01:49:47.164
Oi! Push me.

01:49:47.818 --> 01:49:49.959
Tum, you buffoon!

01:49:50.454 --> 01:49:52.733
Push me, man!
- You'll get jammed like this.

01:49:55.327 --> 01:49:56.932
I'm hungry again.

01:50:03.001 --> 01:50:05.381
Where does Shankar live?
- Up there.

01:50:06.271 --> 01:50:07.273
Careful.

01:50:18.384 --> 01:50:18.920
Aumyg

01:50:19.284 --> 01:50:22.131
ls this Shankaﬂs house?
- No, not this one.

01:50:23.155 --> 01:50:25.137
It's there.
- Where?

01:50:28.794 --> 01:50:30.173
Listen!

01:50:30.897 --> 01:50:31.773
Yes, aunty'!

01:50:32.165 --> 01:50:34.306
The cops took him.

01:50:35.402 --> 01:50:36.542
Few minutes back.

01:50:54.489 --> 01:50:57.132
Sir, what about a similar case that
happened in Gurgaon six months back?

01:51:22.952 --> 01:51:23.795
Have you eaten!

01:51:34.531 --> 01:51:36.342
They will be punished, won't they'!

01:51:36.768 --> 01:51:37.873
Of course.

01:51:40.538 --> 01:51:42.076
They won't be, the bastards

01:51:43.541 --> 01:51:45.888
and the court case will burn me out.

01:51:48.480 --> 01:51:50.462
Let them go to hell!

01:51:52.718 --> 01:51:54.427
Their God will see to them.

01:51:55.921 --> 01:51:58.029
I don't want anything to do
with the courts, sir.

01:52:08.601 --> 01:52:09.410
This is for you.

01:52:14.008 --> 01:52:15.784
<i>Me you Mm me mess'!
- “U.</i>

01:52:17.979 --> 01:52:19.927
<i>Me you a cw'!
- “u.</i>

01:52:21.248 --> 01:52:26.100
Motherfucker! You think you can
pay your way out of this?

01:52:28.822 --> 01:52:30.462
Return my kidney.

01:52:31.592 --> 01:52:33.130
Leave him Shankal.

01:52:35.930 --> 01:52:38.037
What am Ito do, now?

01:52:43.839 --> 01:52:45.844
Shankar, we haven't stolen
your kidney.

01:52:53.883 --> 01:52:55.262
We want to help you.

01:52:59.522 --> 01:53:01.128
What will I do, now?

01:53:03.060 --> 01:53:04.438
We'll find him.

01:53:40.866 --> 01:53:42.905
Sekhsaria is pretty resourceful!

01:53:48.708 --> 01:53:49.517
Thank you!

01:53:55.449 --> 01:53:56.554
Where's Stockholm!

01:53:57.451 --> 01:53:58.795
How would I know!

01:53:59.386 --> 01:54:00.422
Ask.

01:54:47.570 --> 01:54:48.345
<i>N“!</i>

01:54:54.279 --> 01:54:56.557
When I was new in town I
would get confused as well.

01:54:56.947 --> 01:54:59.055
They drink straight from
the tap here.

01:55:06.958 --> 01:55:07.960
What is this party for?

01:55:08.159 --> 01:55:10.199
My friend, Rasmus...
It's his birthday!

01:55:10.829 --> 01:55:11.638
Loin us!

01:55:19.539 --> 01:55:21.646
Saw her moustache!

01:55:37.291 --> 01:55:39.295
Aron Jacobsen seems
like a nice guy.

01:55:39.626 --> 01:55:43.772
He didn't ask too many questions.
Try not to offend him, though.

01:55:43.965 --> 01:55:46.004
Here people sue each
other for every little thing.

01:55:46.401 --> 01:55:48.680
You'll be gone,
but I've got to live here.

01:55:48.870 --> 01:55:49.679
<i>Sure.</i>

01:56:12.828 --> 01:56:14.673
It's stuck. Careful.

01:56:19.435 --> 01:56:21.918
0h, I won't be able to alight from here.

01:56:24.341 --> 01:56:25.980
I'll get down from there.

01:56:38.523 --> 01:56:39.559
Welcome!

01:56:45.463 --> 01:56:47.172
Leave the shoes on.

01:57:01.815 --> 01:57:03.090
You are!

01:57:05.385 --> 01:57:08.027
Ajay.
- Hi! Navin.

01:57:10.390 --> 01:57:17.714
You mentioned your friend works
for a charitable organization!

01:57:18.065 --> 01:57:21.346
He wants to know which
organization do you work for.

01:57:21.502 --> 01:57:24.213
Ask him if he knows
who he got his kidney from.

01:57:24.672 --> 01:57:25.708
Kid nay'!

01:57:26.141 --> 01:57:28.749
Did you say kidney'!
- Yes, kidney.

01:57:31.579 --> 01:57:34.427
Do you know who donated
the kidney'!

01:57:39.488 --> 01:57:42.495
I don't want to talk about it.

01:57:42.791 --> 01:57:43.634
Will that be all!

01:57:44.459 --> 01:57:46.601
He doesn't want to
talk about it.

01:57:47.763 --> 01:57:51.305
(an I see your identification?

01:57:52.369 --> 01:57:55.182
He wants to see our ID.
let's get out of here.

01:58:16.160 --> 01:58:18.700
Your kidney stolen...
from this man.

01:58:18.897 --> 01:58:21.506
No, no, no...
Donated!

01:58:22.900 --> 01:58:26.374
I paid a lot of money
to everybody.

01:58:27.205 --> 01:58:29.517
What do you mean stolen!

01:58:30.175 --> 01:58:33.216
'Stulen'.
- I know stolen means 'stulen'.

01:58:34.647 --> 01:58:37.027
What does he
mean by stolen!

01:58:38.584 --> 01:58:42.297
A man in need of money sold his kidney.
lam told it happens all the time in India.

01:58:42.755 --> 01:58:46.263
It's best if you
leave.

01:58:47.193 --> 01:58:50.974
There was a needy person
who sold it to him...

01:58:51.365 --> 01:58:53.506
he was told it's a
common practice in India.

01:58:53.834 --> 01:58:55.144
Tell him exactly what
happened .

01:58:57.704 --> 01:58:58.683
Listen...

01:58:59.206 --> 01:59:00.881
give us a minute m explain.

01:59:01.075 --> 01:59:02.453
<i>“U! “o!</i>

01:59:03.010 --> 01:59:08.193
I don't understand this!
You come into my house...

01:59:09.551 --> 01:59:11.863
tell me you are from a
charitable organization...

01:59:12.053 --> 01:59:17.941
and now you show me this!
Such liars!

01:59:22.231 --> 01:59:24.611
He is calling us liars.

01:59:26.435 --> 01:59:28.941
This man was to be operated...

01:59:29.538 --> 01:59:31.178
for simple appendicitis.

01:59:31.775 --> 01:59:36.889
And a month later he finds out
his kidney was stolen.

01:59:38.282 --> 01:59:40.959
The racket has come out
in the open.

01:59:41.285 --> 01:59:44.064
Wasn't it Ill. Rajesh Thaloor
who operated on him!

01:59:44.922 --> 01:59:48.430
And all the doctors involved
in this racket have been nailed.

01:59:49.461 --> 01:59:52.308
Ask him if Rajesh Tharool had...
- That's what I am asking... hang on!

01:59:52.496 --> 01:59:56.710
Rajesh Tharool? He in jail?
- Yes... in jail!

01:59:59.804 --> 02:00:01.911
But he's a good man.

02:00:02.440 --> 02:00:03.420
Balls!

02:00:03.942 --> 02:00:05.651
Says he's a good man.
- Let it be!

02:00:10.616 --> 02:00:17.599
He's one of the biggest
profiteers from this racket.

02:00:19.626 --> 02:00:22.974
Were you actually told that the
donor was being paid for the kidney'!

02:00:25.632 --> 02:00:26.737
<i>“NBS-.</i>

02:00:27.633 --> 02:00:28.271
Exactly!

02:00:28.635 --> 02:00:30.948
They told him they were
going to buy him a kidney.

02:00:31.271 --> 02:00:33.310
Is it light to buy one?
- True.

02:00:34.307 --> 02:00:37.918
You think it's right
to buy a kidney'!

02:00:38.112 --> 02:00:40.617
Is it fail to use
poverty m your benefit?

02:00:40.982 --> 02:00:48.807
Is it fair to use somebody': poverty
to your benefit!

02:00:54.196 --> 02:00:56.804
You shouldn't be doing this.

02:01:01.737 --> 02:01:04.185
It's unfair to exploit
my guilt like this.

02:01:07.910 --> 02:01:12.057
What do you want from me!
- What do you want!

02:01:20.824 --> 02:01:24.605
I told you... this means trouble.

02:01:34.406 --> 02:01:39.360
Hey! It's me... Yes.
No, listen...

02:01:39.544 --> 02:01:41.492
Two guys from India are here...

02:01:45.851 --> 02:01:50.031
claim that they work for some
charitable organization.

02:01:51.056 --> 02:01:53.869
Yeah... listen, they are asking
about the kidney.

02:01:57.597 --> 02:01:59.773
That's not what I'm
trying to ask.

02:02:04.971 --> 02:02:06.816
They're accusing it's stolen.

02:02:08.908 --> 02:02:10.082
How? How is...?

02:02:15.082 --> 02:02:16.893
Yes, I'll call you later.

02:02:37.005 --> 02:02:40.890
I have no way of
confirming your claims.

02:02:43.746 --> 02:02:45.557
I was told that the kidney...

02:02:47.784 --> 02:02:50.233
was purchased from a
very needy person...

02:02:51.188 --> 02:02:52.896
for a rather handsome amount.

02:02:55.125 --> 02:02:58.736
I felt very guilty about
it even then.

02:03:05.135 --> 02:03:08.086
I felt the burden of guilt
at every stage of the operation.

02:03:12.643 --> 02:03:18.931
What could I have done?
What would anybody do!

02:03:30.295 --> 02:03:33.576
Wait for a matching donor
and die if you don't find one?

02:03:34.033 --> 02:03:39.887
Maybe my family was
protecting me emotionally...

02:03:40.139 --> 02:03:45.116
by not telling me
it was a stolen kidney.

02:03:47.847 --> 02:03:49.886
Maybe, the doctors feared they
will lose a client.

02:03:50.083 --> 02:03:56.975
But what could I have
done even if...

02:03:59.093 --> 02:04:06.315
they told me the kidney was...

02:04:07.702 --> 02:04:11.176
stolen from somebody!

02:04:17.779 --> 02:04:22.784
I'd like to believe you have
made up this entire story.

02:04:30.192 --> 02:04:33.370
And are instigating my guilt to
make an easy buck from me.

02:04:33.797 --> 02:04:37.840
You are lying. You should
leave before I call the cops.

02:04:39.736 --> 02:04:44.087
He's saying he didn't have an option.

02:04:44.408 --> 02:04:47.017
If he had waited, he
would be dead by now.

02:04:47.244 --> 02:04:48.953
And now he wants to
call the police because

02:04:49.146 --> 02:04:51.527
he thinks that we ale
hereto blackmail him.

02:04:51.749 --> 02:04:54.232
Brother, listen to me...
Let's get out of here.

02:05:01.560 --> 02:05:02.904
What the hell man!

02:05:11.437 --> 02:05:12.918
Talk to him.

02:05:16.341 --> 02:05:19.326
Tell him we just want
to help.

02:05:23.616 --> 02:05:24.322
Si"

02:05:39.100 --> 02:05:40.705
We just want to help.

02:05:45.807 --> 02:05:46.445
How?

02:05:48.443 --> 02:05:49.752
He's asking how.

02:05:50.378 --> 02:05:52.382
He would have to return
Shankar': kidney.

02:05:53.515 --> 02:05:54.962
Seriously'!

02:05:58.287 --> 02:06:02.296
Shankaﬂs kidney will have to
be returned to him.

02:06:05.328 --> 02:06:06.865
That's ridiculous.

02:06:11.301 --> 02:06:13.510
How is that a solution?
That's insane.

02:06:15.005 --> 02:06:17.887
He says that's foolishness.
What kind of solution is that?

02:06:24.048 --> 02:06:27.032
I can't possibly return
his kidney.

02:06:33.391 --> 02:06:35.065
I'll find him a donor.

02:06:41.399 --> 02:06:43.074
I'll pay for the operation.

02:06:51.377 --> 02:06:53.552
I'll take responsibility for everything.

02:06:56.116 --> 02:06:58.394
He is taking complete responsibility
for everything.

02:07:00.953 --> 02:07:02.491
I need to do this.

02:07:03.757 --> 02:07:06.297
He really wants to.

02:07:07.394 --> 02:07:08.373
Finish it, man.

02:07:12.465 --> 02:07:13.274
Okay.

02:07:14.968 --> 02:07:15.504
Okay.

02:07:29.050 --> 02:07:29.859
Let's go.

02:07:40.262 --> 02:07:40.968
Thank you.

02:09:11.159 --> 02:09:13.699
He has written...
Ajay and Navin...

02:09:14.396 --> 02:09:18.543
thank you fol all the
help so far...

02:09:19.368 --> 02:09:22.352
He doesn't want to see
us both again.

02:09:25.574 --> 02:09:28.559
Whatever remains to be sorted out...
is between him and Shankel.

02:09:29.245 --> 02:09:34.564
Tall my lawyer for any
further communication.

02:09:34.884 --> 02:09:37.060
Has he given his lawyer's number?
- Yes, it is here.

02:09:48.432 --> 02:09:49.571
One second...

02:09:50.235 --> 02:09:51.180
Hello!

02:09:51.937 --> 02:09:53.417
Yes! Hello!

02:09:54.239 --> 02:09:57.348
Hey man! Spared any chicks?
- You are crazy.

02:09:58.744 --> 02:09:59.883
Here, speak to him.

02:10:02.414 --> 02:10:03.359
Hello!

02:10:03.915 --> 02:10:05.521
Yes, sir?
- Yes Shankar...

02:10:05.985 --> 02:10:06.827
How ale you, brothel!

02:10:07.253 --> 02:10:10.465
Sir, thank you so much.
You've fixed everything so fast!

02:10:11.056 --> 02:10:12.263
Never thought I'd
see so much money!

02:10:12.458 --> 02:10:15.135
What are you talking about?
- tan you hear me!

02:10:15.628 --> 02:10:18.110
A white man came by this morning
and gave me Rs. 650,000.

02:10:18.298 --> 02:10:20.075
Don't take that money, Shankal.

02:10:20.433 --> 02:10:22.210
Why! I've already taken it.

02:10:22.402 --> 02:10:25.215
No, Shankel. Return the money.
We'll fight m get your kidney back.

02:10:25.405 --> 02:10:27.945
Are you crazy'! What will
I do with a kidney!

02:10:28.408 --> 02:10:32.555
The market rate fol a kidney is 30,000.
He's given me 650,000!

02:10:32.913 --> 02:10:35.226
You can't evaluate parts of a body.
We will sue them.

02:10:35.416 --> 02:10:37.227
You will get a new kidney
and the money you deserve.

02:10:37.418 --> 02:10:38.865
And what if I don't!
- Then I'll pay you.

02:10:39.020 --> 02:10:41.468
What's it to you?
You've already done enough.

02:10:41.689 --> 02:10:43.135
I don't want to waste my
life seeking justice.

02:10:43.324 --> 02:10:46.673
And, he said he'll
send me money every month.

02:10:47.429 --> 02:10:48.932
Hello!
Listen to me brother...

02:10:49.131 --> 02:10:51.443
He shoved the phone in my face...
- Give it back to him.

02:10:51.766 --> 02:10:54.477
<i>Shankaﬂ Wait'.
“h, great one'.!</i>

02:10:55.772 --> 02:10:56.979
One minute...

02:10:57.505 --> 02:10:59.818
I'm stuck, man... here.
- Listen Shankal...

02:11:00.275 --> 02:11:03.453
You deserve better.
We'll fight fol you!

02:11:03.946 --> 02:11:06.931
Not that bullshit again.

02:11:07.316 --> 02:11:10.095
I'll be getting money every month,
Why are you messing it up!

02:11:10.287 --> 02:11:13.294
Don't fuck it up.
Just let me be. Keep this!

02:12:01.274 --> 02:12:03.722
Okay, this is Omnacortil...

02:12:03.910 --> 02:12:05.448
which is 20mg now.

02:12:06.446 --> 02:12:09.259
Vaisocon was 10mg, but it's
been changed to 5mg.

02:12:09.449 --> 02:12:12.433
So, let me just keep it with me,
so you don't get confused.

02:12:13.086 --> 02:12:16.299
This is SOS. Only when required.
- Okay.

02:12:17.225 --> 02:12:19.001
And all the others
ale the same.

02:12:20.561 --> 02:12:22.372
It's all here in the box.
- Okay.

02:12:46.756 --> 02:12:47.735
Nothing came of it.

02:12:58.101 --> 02:13:01.951
All that happened... was because you
decided to do something about it.

02:13:21.426 --> 02:13:23.601
It's as good as it gets.

02:13:32.137 --> 02:13:34.416
Did your donor die from
a head injury!

02:13:35.008 --> 02:13:36.818
Yeah, he was a fit young man.

02:13:38.278 --> 02:13:40.089
What's at the museum?

02:13:40.647 --> 02:13:42.150
They are screening some videos...

02:13:42.349 --> 02:13:44.491
that the I60 has gathered
from his family.

02:13:44.851 --> 02:13:46.799
Will you be meeting
his family then?

02:13:47.020 --> 02:13:48.968
No, they have moved
to Dubai, it seems.

02:13:49.223 --> 02:13:50.669
The scleeninysjust for you?

02:13:50.858 --> 02:13:52.669
There are other recipients
as well.

02:13:52.860 --> 02:13:53.668
Others!

02:13:53.994 --> 02:13:57.103
The way I received one kidney,there
must be someone else who got the other one

02:13:57.331 --> 02:13:59.439
and those who received the
heart, the lungs, etc...

02:13:59.634 --> 02:14:01.912
They can transplant so many
organs from one man?

02:14:02.170 --> 02:14:04.152
Yes. Even skin.

02:14:04.705 --> 02:14:05.650
Eyes and ears!

02:14:05.840 --> 02:14:08.380
Eyes, yes.
Not sure about ears.

02:14:08.643 --> 02:14:09.646
(an I come along!

02:14:10.045 --> 02:14:12.084
No, it's only for the recipients.

02:14:13.015 --> 02:14:14.496
They say it's the
first time in the city...

02:14:14.683 --> 02:14:17.394
that eight people have received
organs from the same donor.

02:14:19.889 --> 02:14:22.668
I wonder what it'll be
like, to meet the others...

02:14:25.896 --> 02:14:28.242
we have a part each
from the same person.

02:14:30.199 --> 02:14:32.044
Isn't a man made up of his pans?

02:14:32.536 --> 02:14:33.743
There must be something more...

02:14:33.937 --> 02:14:36.113
Or else, replacing the parts
would change the person.

02:14:36.340 --> 02:14:37.445
Who knows!

02:14:40.745 --> 02:14:42.749
Where did you dirty your shirt!

02:14:42.947 --> 02:14:43.619
Where'!

02:14:43.848 --> 02:14:44.691
Look there!

02:14:46.251 --> 02:14:48.699
It's cool.
- Okay, bye.

02:14:51.056 --> 02:14:51.865
<i>Naveen'!</i>

02:14:52.423 --> 02:14:55.066
Hi! lam Vuki. I spoke to you
on the phone earlier today.

02:14:55.293 --> 02:14:56.638
Hi. Hope I am not late.

02:14:56.862 --> 02:14:58.810
No, foul recipients have leached,
two more are expected...

02:14:58.963 --> 02:15:00.308
then we'll start the
screening.

02:15:00.933 --> 02:15:02.437
0h! I thought there were
eight of us.

02:15:02.767 --> 02:15:05.580
The man who received the heart
isn't feeling well yet.

02:15:06.039 --> 02:15:08.921
His transplant was successful, but he's
still vulnerable to infection.

02:15:09.408 --> 02:15:10.684
Some organ donation forms...

02:15:10.876 --> 02:15:13.324
Please encourage your friends and
family to pledge their organs.

02:15:13.479 --> 02:15:14.925
Yeah.
- This is for you.

02:15:16.082 --> 02:15:17.461
Ah, you got the left one, right!

02:15:18.818 --> 02:15:20.926
This is Dr. Kala,
our N60': chairman.

02:15:22.422 --> 02:15:24.701
Ale we watching our
donor's home videos!

02:15:25.125 --> 02:15:27.107
No, he was a hobbyist
cave explorer.

02:15:27.294 --> 02:15:30.005
We'll be watching
some videos shot by him.

02:15:30.264 --> 02:15:31.744
Just have a seat with the
other recipients...

02:15:31.932 --> 02:15:33.311
and please keep your phone
on silent.

02:15:33.500 --> 02:15:34.809
Okay. Thank you.
