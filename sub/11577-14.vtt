Previously on Lost Girl:

00:08.926 --> 00:09.881
It's a heartbeat.

00:10.094 --> 00:12.210
[heart beating]

00:12.430 --> 00:14.045
[TRICK]
She was in a Fae institution

00:14.265 --> 00:16.381
for the mentally ill.
She escaped last night.

00:16.601 --> 00:18.011
First Aife escapes, now Jack.

00:18.227 --> 00:20.092
Oh Bo, aren't you happy?

00:20.313 --> 00:22.099
Your mom and dad
are back together.

00:22.315 --> 00:24.931
[BO] Mom, whatever you are
planning, it's dangerous.

00:25.151 --> 00:27.233
I'm taking my daughter home.

01:20.957 --> 01:22.663
Tamsin?

01:24.585 --> 01:26.086
Are you here?

01:30.174 --> 01:31.755
[dialing]

01:33.261 --> 01:34.751
[LAUREN'S VOICEMAIL] You've
reached Dr. Lauren Lewis.

01:34.971 --> 01:36.006
Please leave a message.

01:36.222 --> 01:38.554
If it's a medical emergency,
I can be contacted at--

in a Lucy rerun.

02:03.874 --> 02:05.205

02:05.418 --> 02:07.875
Ugh. Come on, Dyson, pick up.

[phone ringing]

02:10.798 --> 02:12.754
[honking]

02:12.967 --> 02:14.878
Grey means go!

02:42.997 --> 02:46.034
Oh, I am so not
in Kansas anymore.

02:46.250 --> 02:51.244
[opening theme]

03:03.059 --> 03:04.845
I've barred the
windows and doors.

03:05.061 --> 03:06.016
We'll take every precaution

03:06.228 --> 03:09.140
till we know what our
next move is against Jack.

03:09.357 --> 03:10.016
How's Bo?

03:10.232 --> 03:13.395
I've run a renal dialysis
plus a coma cocktail.

03:13.611 --> 03:16.398
She shows complete lack of
responsiveness to stimulation.

03:16.614 --> 03:18.400
Well, how long can she
stay like this?

03:18.616 --> 03:19.571
Not very long.

03:19.784 --> 03:22.070
[LAUREN] I think when she
found Trick and Aife it...

03:22.286 --> 03:25.403
Her mind couldn't
withstand the trauma.

03:25.623 --> 03:28.581
From this point on,
we stay guarded.

03:28.793 --> 03:31.876
Jack could be anywhere;
nobody leaves this house alone.

03:32.088 --> 03:34.921
Buddy system.
I'll take Bo.

03:35.132 --> 03:36.508
We've all got Bo.

03:36.717 --> 03:39.834
That's right--
voices, smells, touch.

03:40.054 --> 03:41.214
The more interaction
we give her,

03:41.430 --> 03:43.261
the greater her
chance for recovery.

03:43.474 --> 03:45.556
She'll recover.

03:45.768 --> 03:48.009
She has to.

03:52.066 --> 03:55.149
[LAUREN] When's the
last time you slept?

03:55.361 --> 03:58.103
Probably the
same time you did.

03:59.281 --> 04:01.317
I'll do another sweep.

04:01.534 --> 04:03.274
Don't forget the attic.

04:06.664 --> 04:10.202
He's still carrying
around Trick's will.

04:10.418 --> 04:11.624
Do you think he's read it?

04:11.836 --> 04:13.827
Doubtful, he's still grieving.

04:15.756 --> 04:19.874
You can go.
I'll look after Bo.

04:20.094 --> 04:21.334
Tamsin, you should
be resting, you're--

04:21.554 --> 04:24.512
Pregnant, not made of glass.

04:24.723 --> 04:28.966
Go on. It'll give you a
chance to figure this out.

04:29.186 --> 04:33.020
Yeah. Yeah, I've had
so much luck so far.

04:37.111 --> 04:39.477
If anything changes,
you call me.

04:48.664 --> 04:51.747
You have no idea how much I'd
kill for a drink right now.

04:53.502 --> 04:55.083

The part of the movie

05:06.307 --> 05:08.298
where the girl goes
down the creepy alley...

05:08.517 --> 05:10.098
...all alone.

05:10.311 --> 05:11.471
--[WOMAN yells]
--[BO gasps]

05:11.687 --> 05:14.895
Oh my god,
what are you doing?!

05:15.107 --> 05:16.688
I'm sorry.
Aren't you the one

05:16.901 --> 05:18.186
following me
in a creepy alley?

05:18.402 --> 05:20.233
Why the hell are you
dressed like that?

05:20.446 --> 05:22.357
I could say the
same thing about you.

05:22.573 --> 05:24.689
Pigtails, huh?
You're really leaning out.

05:24.909 --> 05:26.774
Tamsin?

05:28.496 --> 05:32.409
If you need a property,
you need a good person.

05:32.625 --> 05:33.865
You're a real
estate developer?

05:34.084 --> 05:35.415
You don't even pay rent.

05:35.628 --> 05:37.414
You must have me
confused with someone else.

05:37.630 --> 05:38.915
I'm Thomasina.

05:39.131 --> 05:40.837
And I'm dreaming.

05:41.050 --> 05:43.291
Standing up? I thought
only horses did that.

05:43.511 --> 05:44.921
That's what this is.

05:45.137 --> 05:48.379
See, I'm asleep, and you're
downstairs making waffles.

05:48.599 --> 05:50.681
Wake up, Bo!

05:50.893 --> 05:53.760
Ah, that's highly unlikely since
I'm very allergic to gluten.

05:53.979 --> 05:55.139
Now, if you'll excuse me--

05:55.356 --> 05:58.314
Wait, if I'm not dreaming,
where's everybody else?

05:58.526 --> 05:59.481
[THOMASINA]
Well, when the Pyrippus came,

05:59.693 --> 06:00.978
the colony cleared out.

06:01.195 --> 06:04.278
Which is why I'm bulldozing.
Everyone needs a legacy.

06:04.490 --> 06:06.321
Thomasina Towers.

06:06.534 --> 06:08.320
The Pyrippus...

06:08.536 --> 06:11.118
I thought it just represented
the Lord of Darkness.

06:11.330 --> 06:11.989
My father.

06:12.206 --> 06:13.412
Your father's the Pyrippus?!

06:13.624 --> 06:16.457
No, no, I don't know that yet,
but I do know that he's evil.

06:16.669 --> 06:19.877
Which is why I need to wake
up and get back to my life.

06:20.089 --> 06:22.000
Well, it sounds like
you need Maestro.

06:22.216 --> 06:23.331
He knows everything.

06:23.551 --> 06:26.509
Great, where do I find him?

06:26.720 --> 06:28.301
He's slightly inaccessible.

06:28.514 --> 06:31.381
Unless I have the help of a
plucky real estate developer.

06:31.600 --> 06:33.306
Hm. Like ma]?

06:33.519 --> 06:35.601
I don't think so.

06:35.813 --> 06:37.724
What if I insist?

06:39.900 --> 06:41.731
What are you doing?

06:41.944 --> 06:43.354
Off...

06:43.571 --> 06:46.028
[THOMASINA]
Take your fingers off. Okay.

06:46.240 --> 06:47.525
Hey lady, you're gonna help me

06:47.741 --> 06:49.732
even if I have to
force you to do it.

06:49.952 --> 06:50.782
That's funny.

06:50.995 --> 06:52.735
Because I thought--

06:52.955 --> 06:54.365
Auh!

06:56.709 --> 06:58.040
[LAUREN] There's not
a lot of information

06:58.252 --> 07:00.743
on Valkyrie
pregnancies so...

07:00.963 --> 07:05.332
I went with old
faithful--folic acid.

07:05.551 --> 07:08.213
Thanks.

07:08.429 --> 07:09.965
I will say that
Valkyrie pregnancies

07:10.180 --> 07:12.637
accelerate much faster.

07:16.478 --> 07:18.560
[LAUREN]
You can't ignore it, Tamsin.

07:18.772 --> 07:22.185
Don't call yourself
an it, Lauren.

07:22.401 --> 07:23.686
You're a person.

07:23.902 --> 07:26.393
Okay look, I'm not gonna pretend
to know how you feel right now,

07:26.614 --> 07:27.148
because I don't--

07:27.364 --> 07:29.275
You're right, you don't.

07:29.491 --> 07:31.982
But I will say that this
will not take care of itself.

07:32.202 --> 07:34.534
And neither will Bo.

07:34.747 --> 07:37.705
So as much as I
appreciate the pep talk,

07:37.916 --> 07:40.248
I'd rather you
just focus on her.

07:44.131 --> 07:45.746
Leave me alone, Lauren.

07:45.966 --> 07:47.547
I don't wanna leave you alone.

07:47.760 --> 07:48.465
I'm not asking.

07:48.677 --> 07:51.384
Fine, I'll go.

07:51.597 --> 07:54.805
But just let me make one
thing very clear to you.

07:55.017 --> 08:03.607
You will never be alone,
not ever, not with this.

08:03.817 --> 08:07.401
Please don't ignore
what happened, Tamsin.

08:07.613 --> 08:10.355
Please.

08:14.203 --> 08:15.909
[sighs]

08:22.586 --> 08:26.329
I have no idea what
she's talking about.

08:28.217 --> 08:29.423
[BO]
You can't just ignore me.

08:29.635 --> 08:30.841
[THOMASINA]
Stop following me!

08:31.053 --> 08:33.260
[BO] Look, just because my father
is evil does not mean that I am.

08:33.472 --> 08:35.178
Plus, what about you,
Ms. Disaster Capitalism?

08:35.391 --> 08:37.882
[THOMASINA] Ha! I'm not evil,
I'm an opportunist.

08:38.102 --> 08:39.467
[30}
And alone.

08:39.687 --> 08:42.053
Everyone left the colony
without you--why?

08:42.272 --> 08:43.022
[THOMASINA]
I didn't wanna go.

08:43.232 --> 08:44.642
[BO] Or maybe you just
had no one to go with.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.689
Well, we are born alone
and we die alone.

08:46.902 --> 08:47.527
That's pretty heartless.

08:47.736 --> 08:48.816
Heart is overrated.

08:49.029 --> 08:51.645
Maybe you just say that
because somebody broke yours.

08:55.703 --> 08:56.863
How did you know that?

08:57.079 --> 08:59.365
Let's just say I'm really
good at reading people.

08:59.581 --> 09:00.491
Look, the point is,

09:00.708 --> 09:03.700
if this Maestro is so great
maybe he can help you too.

09:03.919 --> 09:06.285
I'm okay, I'm fine.

09:06.505 --> 09:08.621
How did you know I
don't like being alone?

09:08.841 --> 09:12.004
Because nobody does,
not all the time.

09:12.219 --> 09:15.427
Now please, just help me.

09:15.639 --> 09:16.549
I can't.

09:16.765 --> 09:18.551
You need to follow
the red brick road.

09:18.767 --> 09:20.598
And only the "one" can see it.

09:20.811 --> 09:22.347
The "one," huh?

09:22.563 --> 09:24.394
Well, I might be able
to help with that.

09:24.606 --> 09:26.471
How are you gonna see red?

09:27.860 --> 09:31.978
I've seen it before. I just have
to remember what it looks like.

09:32.197 --> 09:34.654
Okay, red, red.

09:34.867 --> 09:38.655
Apples are red...
Cherries, red.

09:38.871 --> 09:41.658
Cyndi Lauper's hair, red.

09:42.750 --> 09:44.411
What else?

09:55.929 --> 09:57.920
What is it? What did you see?

09:58.140 --> 09:59.721
I don't know.

10:03.687 --> 10:05.427
Wait how did we--?

10:12.237 --> 10:14.228
It worked.

10:16.283 --> 10:17.523
[30}
You coming, Thomasina?

10:17.743 --> 10:19.654
Can't be alone forever, right?

10:20.329 --> 10:21.034
[THOMASINA]
Are you sure?

10:21.246 --> 10:22.702
I don't see anything.

10:22.915 --> 10:25.702
Wait, wait, I'm coming.

10:43.894 --> 10:45.509
Lauren?

10:47.856 --> 10:49.812
Lauren, |-| think
something's wrong!

10:52.694 --> 10:53.729
[LAUREN]
What?

10:53.946 --> 10:55.652
What--is she all right?
What happened?

10:55.864 --> 11:00.779
No, no it's--

11:00.994 --> 11:02.450
Are you in pain?

11:02.663 --> 11:07.498
It feels like... like
a-a fish, or, or an eel...

11:09.795 --> 11:12.707
lt's moving.

11:12.923 --> 11:14.709
Holy shit...

11:14.925 --> 11:16.665
Holy shit.

11:18.512 --> 11:20.798
I'm having a baby.

11:23.475 --> 11:27.764
[beeping]

11:27.980 --> 11:28.810
What is it?

11:29.022 --> 11:31.229
What's wrong, is she okay?

11:31.441 --> 11:33.818
No, the IV can't do it alone.

11:34.027 --> 11:36.063
She needs to feed.

11:36.280 --> 11:38.646
Is she getting weaker?

11:38.866 --> 11:42.859
If we don't wake her up,
Bo is gonna starve to death.

11:50.252 --> 11:52.038
[VEX]
Got it--| got it!

11:53.547 --> 11:55.378
[VEX groans]

11:55.591 --> 11:57.047
[DYSON] What part of
stay in the clubhouse

11:57.259 --> 11:58.374
did you two not understand?

11:58.594 --> 12:00.209
Don't worry,
we weren't followed.

12:00.429 --> 12:02.340
And what was worth
risking your life for?

12:02.556 --> 12:03.796
[MARK] Trick's books.

12:04.016 --> 12:04.926
I thought they could
help with Bo.

12:05.142 --> 12:05.892
[VEX] Oh, yeah.

12:06.101 --> 12:07.682
More than once, he opened
up one of these bad boys

12:07.895 --> 12:09.635
and presto,
the answer was there.

12:09.855 --> 12:11.015
It's very useful.

12:11.231 --> 12:12.687
And we thought if
Trick were here--

12:12.900 --> 12:14.436
Except he's not.

12:14.651 --> 12:16.858
These books were his and
they belong in his lair.

12:17.070 --> 12:18.606
Not if they can help us.

12:18.822 --> 12:20.278
I mean Trick's gone, but--

12:20.490 --> 12:21.650
somebody needs to step up.

12:21.867 --> 12:25.109
What and suddenly you can read
ancient scripture, is that it?

12:27.039 --> 12:28.779
Just forget it.

12:30.876 --> 12:31.865
Mark.

12:32.920 --> 12:34.706
He's mourning too, you know.

12:34.922 --> 12:36.878
I'm just sayin'.

12:38.508 --> 12:40.794
[DYSON] Trick was always better
at dealing with him than I am.

12:41.011 --> 12:45.175
Yeah well, Trick was better at
dealing with everyone than you.

12:46.558 --> 12:49.470
[DYSON] It's probably because
he believed in people.

12:51.229 --> 12:53.060
Bo more than anyone.

12:54.232 --> 12:56.063
And you.

12:59.696 --> 13:01.561
Listen, it's none
of my business,

13:01.782 --> 13:04.649
but not looking at those books

13:04.868 --> 13:07.905
isn't gonna change
anything, Dyson.

13:09.039 --> 13:10.779
I gotta check on Bo.

13:22.094 --> 13:23.584
[THOMASINA]
Ugh! Stupid tree nymphs.

13:23.804 --> 13:25.260
They're always
messing with these.

13:25.472 --> 13:27.008
Well, that explains
the going in circles.

13:27.224 --> 13:29.340
The Blair Witch vibe however...

13:29.559 --> 13:31.811
[TREES whispering]
Pyrippus, Pyrippus, Pyrippus.

13:32.020 --> 13:34.102
Great, talking trees.

13:34.314 --> 13:36.100
[BO] Why do | feel like
we're being watched?

13:36.316 --> 13:38.272
Well | always feel like
I'm being watched.

13:38.485 --> 13:40.066
Probably 'cause I am, I mean--

13:40.278 --> 13:41.609
Look at me.

13:43.824 --> 13:45.314
Wait do you think
it's the Pyrippus?

13:45.534 --> 13:47.195
I don't know.

13:47.411 --> 13:48.696
[THOMASINA] Great, I'm
gonna die in the woods

13:48.912 --> 13:50.413
with a girl who wears gingham.

13:50.622 --> 13:53.204
[BO] Oh! How did I
find a meaner Tamsin?

13:53.417 --> 13:55.829
Wait, did you hear that?

13:56.044 --> 13:58.330
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

13:58.547 --> 14:02.005
[moans, groans]

14:03.427 --> 14:04.667
Dyson?

14:04.886 --> 14:06.342
Ow.

14:08.557 --> 14:10.969
Is that you?

14:11.184 --> 14:13.766
Sergeant Major Nosyd
of the 67th division--

14:13.979 --> 14:15.685
Operation Pyrippus Watch.

14:15.897 --> 14:18.183
Are you aware that you're
in a restricted military area?

14:18.400 --> 14:20.686
Lemme guess, you're not Dyson.

14:20.902 --> 14:22.733
Like the vacuum cleaner?

14:22.946 --> 14:24.152
No, sir.

14:24.364 --> 14:25.865
Unfortunately you
will have to be prosecuted

14:26.074 --> 14:27.814
to the full extent of the law.

14:28.035 --> 14:30.572
Okay, relax Private Ryan.
We didn't know.

14:30.787 --> 14:31.742
Where's your platoon?

14:31.955 --> 14:35.789
We've been through
this entire forest.

14:36.001 --> 14:37.411
They moved on.

14:37.627 --> 14:39.413
[THOMASINA] So much for
not leaving a man behind.

14:39.629 --> 14:40.880
[30}
Why would they leave one soldier

14:41.089 --> 14:42.295
to watch this entire area?

14:42.507 --> 14:43.166
[THOMASINA]
And where's your gun?

14:43.383 --> 14:44.213
--[BO] And supplies.
--[THOMASINA] And--

14:44.426 --> 14:47.338
They moved on...

14:47.554 --> 14:51.172
I didn't move with them.

14:51.391 --> 14:54.053
You're a deserter.

14:54.269 --> 14:55.384
You're not protecting
this forest,

14:55.604 --> 14:56.810
you're hiding
from the Pyrippus.

14:57.022 --> 15:01.641
Yes, my platoon is out
there looking for it.

15:01.860 --> 15:03.851
But I was too scared.

15:04.071 --> 15:06.187
| know--some hero, huh?

15:06.406 --> 15:07.816
[NOSYD] But you have
no idea what it's like to be

15:08.033 --> 15:10.240
responsible for
the safety of the colony.

15:10.452 --> 15:11.783
Oh, really?

15:11.995 --> 15:13.781
You don't think so?
You know what?

15:13.997 --> 15:15.453
[BO] This place is
getting on my nerves.

15:15.665 --> 15:16.916
[THOMASINA]
Don't look at me.

15:17.125 --> 15:18.786
Everything was fine until
Dances With Wolves showed up.

15:19.002 --> 15:20.708
Everyone here looks like
someone they're not.

15:20.921 --> 15:22.707
You're all afraid of something
that you don't even know.

15:22.923 --> 15:24.208
[BO] And the only person
who can help me is

15:24.424 --> 15:26.881
some mysterious Maestro that
no one knows how to get to.

15:27.094 --> 15:30.131
I know how to get
to the Maestro...

15:30.347 --> 15:31.211
[NOSYD] Or I
know someone who does.

15:31.431 --> 15:33.012
You do?

15:33.225 --> 15:35.386
[tapping]

15:35.602 --> 15:36.808
Where is that coming from?

15:37.020 --> 15:39.181
[tapping]

15:39.940 --> 15:46.152
[tapping]

15:52.661 --> 15:55.073
First, I fail Trick.

15:56.414 --> 15:59.656
And now, I'm failing you.

16:02.671 --> 16:08.883
Please, Bo, if you can
hear me, tell me what I can do.

16:09.094 --> 16:11.801
How can I help you?

16:13.390 --> 16:15.597
I'll do anything...

16:15.809 --> 16:17.800
But I won't do that.

16:18.019 --> 16:20.271
And neither should you,
it's too dangerous.

16:20.480 --> 16:20.889
[THOMASINA] He's lying.

16:21.106 --> 16:23.472
He doesn't know anything
about the Maestro.

16:23.692 --> 16:24.647
[NOSYD]
I know the Maestro

16:24.860 --> 16:28.273
is the keeper of the
secrets and the sanctuary.

16:28.488 --> 16:29.989
Of course.

16:30.198 --> 16:32.063
If you're Tamsin
and you're Dyson...

16:32.284 --> 16:33.820
then the Maestro's Trick.

16:34.035 --> 16:39.496
I'm Nosyd. And I'm flattered
you want my help, but...

16:39.708 --> 16:42.791
like you said,
I'm just a deserter.

16:43.003 --> 16:45.119
You need someone braver.

16:45.338 --> 16:47.169
You know what? You're right.

16:47.382 --> 16:49.668
Let's go, Thomasina.
Sorry to bother you.

16:49.885 --> 16:52.718
See ya later, Captain AWOL.

16:52.929 --> 16:55.261
Wait! You'll get lost.

16:55.473 --> 16:57.259
And you can't catch
your own food.

16:57.475 --> 16:59.511
Well then I guess we'll
just starve to death.

16:59.728 --> 17:03.186
Speak for yourself, I'm gonna
Donner Party that shit.

17:03.398 --> 17:06.606
You won't find the
Maestro without a guide.

17:06.818 --> 17:10.606
Probably not. I mean, my sense
of smell is pretty terrible.

17:10.822 --> 17:12.198
Come on, let's go.

17:12.407 --> 17:14.068
Okay, okay!

17:14.284 --> 17:16.650
I'll come with you.

17:16.870 --> 17:20.112
You just have to promise
to do it my way.

17:20.332 --> 17:22.118
You're the Sergeant.

17:22.334 --> 17:24.996
You'll follow my lead?

17:25.212 --> 17:30.923
Trust me when I tell you I've
been waiting for this day.

17:31.134 --> 17:33.466
Off to see the Maestro?

17:33.678 --> 17:34.929
[DYSON]
Bo, can you hear me?

17:35.138 --> 17:37.595
Wait, that's Dyson.

17:37.807 --> 17:40.264
--[DYSON] I'm right here, Bo.
--[B0] The real Dyson.

17:40.477 --> 17:42.934
"[DYSON] I want you to wake up.
--[BO] If I can hear him then--

17:43.146 --> 17:43.931
[DYSON] Come on, Bo.

17:44.147 --> 17:45.603
What's she talking about?

17:45.815 --> 17:46.520
Oh, she's crazy.

17:46.733 --> 17:49.270
My friends know
that I'm asleep.

17:49.486 --> 17:51.977
They can't wake me up.

17:52.197 --> 17:55.109
Wake up, Bo.

17:56.534 --> 17:57.740
Bo's test results.

17:57.953 --> 18:00.285
I found toxins in her system
that I don't recognize.

18:00.497 --> 18:01.953
What do you mean?

18:02.165 --> 18:03.120
I've never seen them before.

18:03.333 --> 18:05.540
I don't even know
how to treat them.

18:06.836 --> 18:09.043
These are the clothes that
she fell unconcious in here?

18:09.256 --> 18:11.212
Yeah, what are you doing?

18:13.343 --> 18:15.959
Following the evidence train.

18:16.179 --> 18:18.044
Gotta stick with
what you know, right?

18:18.265 --> 18:19.721
Devil's in the details.

18:19.933 --> 18:21.469
Yeah.

18:24.396 --> 18:26.808
You know that you didn't
fail Trick, right Dyson?

18:27.023 --> 18:28.524
[LAUREN] You know that.

18:28.733 --> 18:30.689
I was his lieutenant, Lauren.

18:30.902 --> 18:32.517
I should've had his back.

18:32.737 --> 18:35.023
There was nothing that
you could have done.

18:35.240 --> 18:38.107
Icould've saved him.

18:38.618 --> 18:40.279
Dyson...

18:45.709 --> 18:47.700
What, what is that?

18:49.004 --> 18:51.996
Looks like something bit Bo.

18:53.508 --> 18:56.625
This could be the
source of our toxins.

19:02.017 --> 19:04.724
Now | just have to figure
out where they came from.

19:07.522 --> 19:09.854
The Shtriga moth.

19:10.066 --> 19:11.351
It feeds off pain
and suffering,

19:11.568 --> 19:12.978
victims of
traumatic events.

19:13.194 --> 19:14.730
She was bitten
by a bloody moth?

19:14.946 --> 19:17.062
Oh yeah, we think we brought it
back from the funeral home--

19:17.282 --> 19:18.362
maybe Trick's flowers.

19:18.575 --> 19:20.190
Wait, I've seen
this moth here.

19:20.410 --> 19:22.867
I thought it was just
'cause it's musty as hell.

19:23.079 --> 19:25.411
We need to find it.

19:25.623 --> 19:26.829
[DYSON] It says here
that "only the Shtriga

19:27.042 --> 19:28.031
can cure those
that it's drained."

19:28.251 --> 19:31.584
Yeah but, how could
the same moth cure Bo?

19:31.796 --> 19:35.755
By spitting Bo's blood
back into her own mouth.

19:35.967 --> 19:37.753
We just have to wait until
it resumes its human form.

19:37.969 --> 19:39.254
Well, how long will that take?

19:39.471 --> 19:41.678
Bo's getting weaker
by the second.

19:41.890 --> 19:45.724
I don't know. But it
says here that...

19:45.935 --> 19:48.551
...without the Shtriga,
Bo will die.

19:48.772 --> 19:51.138
We have to find that moth.

19:53.068 --> 19:55.480
[THOMASINA]
Is that what I think it is?

19:55.695 --> 19:57.686
[NOSYD]
This is where the scent leads.

19:57.906 --> 20:00.898
[BO] Elevator pod in the
middle of the forest.

20:01.117 --> 20:02.277
Move over, Bill and Ted.

20:02.494 --> 20:04.576
[THOMASINA] Well, I guess
if I was a Maestro,

20:04.788 --> 20:07.279
I'd wanna live in
a penthouse too.

20:07.499 --> 20:09.956
Penthouse...

20:10.168 --> 20:11.283
Dad?

20:11.503 --> 20:13.835
Is the Maestro you?

20:14.047 --> 20:24.048
[mystical music plays]

20:27.394 --> 20:30.227
[LAUREN] Great. I've tried
Atropine to stop the poison.

20:30.438 --> 20:31.678
No change.

20:31.898 --> 20:36.267
Which brings us to
steroid cocktails.

20:36.486 --> 20:38.727
Or the whim of a moth.

20:41.449 --> 20:43.940
Graduated top of my
class, summa cum laude,

20:44.160 --> 20:47.527
and I can't even resolve
a simple bug bite.

20:49.332 --> 20:52.119
Or do anything
at all apparently.

21:00.343 --> 21:02.584
Ancient Fae curses,
spitting moths.

21:02.804 --> 21:06.092
When will it end?
Why can't I cure you?!

21:07.183 --> 21:08.844
Oh come on, Bo!

21:09.060 --> 21:12.018
Bo, stay with me.
Please hold on!

21:12.230 --> 21:13.936
[elevator dings]

21:17.986 --> 21:19.817
[THOMASINA]
You coming, Gingham?

21:20.029 --> 21:21.644
[BC]
I don't like this.

21:21.865 --> 21:23.355
[NOSYD]
Why don't you like this?

21:23.575 --> 21:25.611
[THOMASINA] It's definitely
not the interior design.

21:25.827 --> 21:28.660
This place is the bomb!

21:29.581 --> 21:32.163
[NOSYD]
I think she means bong.

21:32.375 --> 21:36.084
This is Nepenthe, the Grecian
drug of forgetfulness.

21:42.844 --> 21:44.050
We should go.

21:44.262 --> 21:47.174
If the Maestro lives here, I
don't think I wanna meet him.

21:47.390 --> 21:49.972
Stop right there.

21:51.561 --> 21:54.678
Dude, if you're
here for the kegger

21:54.898 --> 21:57.935
I'm gonna need
the secret password.

21:58.151 --> 22:02.360
[WOMAN] Hey... nice braids.

22:03.948 --> 22:05.654
I love fruit punch.

22:05.867 --> 22:08.734
It's kinda like the wine
of punches, y'know?

22:08.953 --> 22:11.490
[WOMAN] Then I hate wine,
unless of course it's beer.

22:11.706 --> 22:14.618
But then it's not
really wine, it's more beer.

22:14.834 --> 22:17.371
Please tell me you're
not the Maestro.

22:17.587 --> 22:19.703
You wanna buy a didgeridoo?

22:19.923 --> 22:21.208
This is Lola.

22:21.424 --> 22:23.585
She can guide us
to the Maestro.

22:23.801 --> 22:26.292
Could, till I lost the map.

22:26.513 --> 22:27.423
Bummer.

22:27.639 --> 22:30.221
Do you ever think,
like, oh shit,

22:30.433 --> 22:31.718
| forgot to put my pants on!

22:31.935 --> 22:33.800
But then you're
like, no, I didn't?

22:34.020 --> 22:36.557
'Cause, you know, they're on.

22:41.069 --> 22:44.186
The map's gotta be
around here somewhere.

22:44.405 --> 22:46.316
I'll check the kitchen.

22:46.533 --> 22:49.366
And I'll take
the earth mother.

22:54.624 --> 22:56.410
People say that this
stuff isn't medicinal,

22:56.626 --> 22:57.490
but they are so wrong...

22:57.710 --> 23:01.328
...because this brownie is
like Joey Lawrence, whoa!

23:01.548 --> 23:02.378
Medicinal?

23:02.590 --> 23:04.251
Are you sick, Lola?

23:04.467 --> 23:07.550
Well, I have too many thoughts
about what I should do.

23:07.762 --> 23:10.048
Over-analyzing.

23:10.265 --> 23:11.721
I know someone like that.

23:11.933 --> 23:14.140
Yeah, and this stuff
just makes it go away.

23:14.352 --> 23:18.937
Except it doesn't go away,
it just makes things foggy.

23:19.148 --> 23:20.649
--[BO] Wait.
--[LOLA] What?

23:20.858 --> 23:22.473
[BO] I bet I know
where the map is.

23:22.694 --> 23:23.979
I think it's in your head.

23:24.195 --> 23:25.184
What, get it out!

23:25.405 --> 23:26.315
Get it out!

23:26.531 --> 23:27.520
[30}
Lola, you have to remember!

23:27.740 --> 23:29.150
[LOLA] I can't,
I don't know anything.

23:29.367 --> 23:32.200
Yes, you can.
You're a smart girl.

23:32.412 --> 23:35.370
Hey, how did you get in here?

23:35.582 --> 23:36.492
Work with me.

23:36.708 --> 23:38.539
Admit it--you already
have the answer.

23:38.751 --> 23:40.332
It's just not where
you normally look.

23:40.545 --> 23:41.455
Now think!

23:41.671 --> 23:43.002
Okay.

23:45.425 --> 23:48.292
Well, don't hurt yourself.

23:48.511 --> 23:50.797
[BO] Lola.

23:52.682 --> 23:54.172
I got it!

23:54.392 --> 23:55.222
It's all...

23:55.435 --> 23:56.265
...in here.

23:56.477 --> 23:57.762
We don't have to
wait for the moth

23:57.979 --> 24:00.516
to resume human form
to get the spit.

24:00.732 --> 24:02.848
We're gonna fast track
its transformation.

24:03.067 --> 24:03.726
How?

24:03.943 --> 24:04.773
[LAUREN]
According to these books,

24:04.986 --> 24:06.442
the Shtriga's transformation
into human form

24:06.654 --> 24:07.734
can be accelerated.

24:07.947 --> 24:09.903
By a magic potion or...?

24:10.116 --> 24:11.322
By an elixir.

39:24.488 --> 39:28.652
member of Clan Fin Arvin,
leave the following:

39:28.867 --> 39:32.735
To Kenzi--the ring
of Yggdrasil.

39:32.955 --> 39:36.197
[BO] This ring shall grant you
freedom from claiming,

39:36.416 --> 39:38.031
allowing you constant passage

39:38.252 --> 39:40.368
between the Fae
and human worlds."

39:41.547 --> 39:43.538
Aw, Trick.

39:45.050 --> 39:50.135
[BO] "To Lauren,
my tomes of the Occult.

39:50.347 --> 39:53.965
There is a happy marriage
between science and magic.

39:54.184 --> 39:56.926
I hope you find it one day.

39:57.145 --> 40:01.684
To Tamsin, eternal wanderer,
perennially without habitat.

40:01.900 --> 40:04.687
I leave the blanket of
Skeemotah; woven from the sky.

40:04.903 --> 40:10.318
As long as we are under
the stars, we're home."

40:12.578 --> 40:14.990
[BO] Vex, he left
you something too.

40:18.500 --> 40:20.001
[30]
"The compass of Nirad.

40:20.210 --> 40:22.121
You have found your
light in the dark.

40:22.337 --> 40:25.704
Here's hoping that
your path remains true."

40:38.228 --> 40:45.225
"To my lieutenant, Dyson;
to you and Mark,

40:45.444 --> 40:50.438
I leave my beloved bar,
The Dal Riata.

40:50.657 --> 40:53.490
[B0] A place of sanctuary for
the colony in dark times.

40:53.702 --> 40:57.786
There is no man more able
to provide this service.

40:57.998 --> 41:01.035
You are my son,
Dyson, now and forever.

41:01.251 --> 41:03.958
Please show Mark the way."

41:08.717 --> 41:12.505
"And last, but not least...

41:12.721 --> 41:14.632
my Isabeau.“

41:16.600 --> 41:19.888
"I leave you my heart,
and my eternal gratitude

41:20.103 --> 41:22.355
[BO] for what you have
given me--my granddaughter.

41:22.564 --> 41:25.431
It is with deep pride
that I look at the woman

41:25.651 --> 41:34.400
you've become--
honourable, kind, strong."

41:39.581 --> 41:41.082
Want me to read it?

41:44.961 --> 41:47.748
"Life is not about
finding your path,

41:47.964 --> 41:50.216
it's about creating one."

41:51.760 --> 41:53.045
"Please don't forget--"

41:53.261 --> 41:55.422
You are my blood too.

41:57.974 --> 42:01.307
Always and forever.

42:26.044 --> 42:28.080
[VEX] Hey, Tamsin, I've got your
skee-mee-jee-mee thing, yeah?

42:28.296 --> 42:29.422
Thought you might want it.

42:29.631 --> 42:32.088
Hideous piece of cloth is bound
to scare away any monster.

42:32.300 --> 42:33.915
That's for certain.

42:43.019 --> 42:45.431
[JACK]
The Dark Mesmer.

42:45.647 --> 42:47.183
Trick gives you a compass

42:47.399 --> 42:48.980
and suddenly you're on
the straight and narrow.

42:49.192 --> 42:50.477
Shame.

42:50.694 --> 42:55.108
You might have been
useful. Still could...

42:56.074 --> 42:57.735
[VEX yells]

43:04.624 --> 43:06.785
I don't play that way anymore.

43:07.002 --> 43:11.041
I finally found a team
that'll accept me.

43:11.256 --> 43:14.373
Well, I'd like you to give
your team a message for me.

43:14.593 --> 43:15.457
Oh-ho yeah.

43:15.677 --> 43:18.009
Lemme get my memo pad.

43:18.221 --> 43:21.179
Oh, I think this is
pretty self-explanatory.

43:36.156 --> 43:41.150
[closing theme]
