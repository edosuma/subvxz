00:01.434 --> 00:03.102
<i>[Amy Slaton] Previously on
1000-lb Sisters...</i>

00:03.104 --> 00:05.671
We're going on
a family vacation, y'all.

00:05.673 --> 00:06.972
What's wrong, Tam?

00:09.909 --> 00:11.377
Tammy, stop acting like that.

00:12.345 --> 00:14.079
Now, you gotta stop
being rude to people.

00:14.081 --> 00:15.948
Just because you have issues,

00:15.950 --> 00:17.249
doesn't give you the right
to talk to people

00:17.251 --> 00:19.118
like you've lost
your [bleep] mind.

00:32.399 --> 00:35.034
It actually fits
your personality to a tee.

00:41.174 --> 00:42.374
I'm gonna give you the dynamite.

00:44.077 --> 00:45.944
Chris is the one that will
blow some [bleep] up to you.

00:45.946 --> 00:47.913
[all laughing]

00:47.915 --> 00:49.148
<i>[Amy] I just want Tammy
to come out</i>

00:49.150 --> 00:50.315
<i>and just have some fun.</i>

00:50.317 --> 00:53.018
Why be locked up
in the hotel room by yourself?

01:01.194 --> 01:02.261
<i>[Amanda Slaton] A wheelchair,</i>

01:02.263 --> 01:04.229
<i>does it help your mobility,
your freedom?</i>

01:09.869 --> 01:10.836
[Amanda] It is easy.

01:10.838 --> 01:12.471
[Tammy Slaton] Will you shut up?

01:12.473 --> 01:16.141
Tammy you're not gonna
hollering at me like that, it's rude.

01:18.778 --> 01:20.145
Bitch don't try me like that.

01:21.247 --> 01:23.348
Why don't you get up that
[bleep] chair and [bleep]

01:23.350 --> 01:24.850
- Wheel [bleep]
- Get the [bleep] up then.

01:24.852 --> 01:26.285
You won't shut up.

01:43.837 --> 01:46.004
Just wait till
these cameras ain't rolling.

01:46.006 --> 01:47.906
You gotta stay
[bleep] away from me.

01:47.908 --> 01:49.708
You can kiss my ass.

01:49.710 --> 01:52.010
You can, you can kiss
my [bleep] ass.

01:55.115 --> 01:58.350
<i>[Amy] I was really hoping
for a nice, quiet family meal,</i>

01:58.352 --> 02:01.954
but Tammy and Amanda
get into a fight

02:01.956 --> 02:04.423
over the damn
electric wheelchair.

02:04.958 --> 02:06.225
Good God.

02:07.694 --> 02:10.195
Look, Gage is over here
being the only good one.

02:20.473 --> 02:23.142
And you wanna cuss me, I'd
bend over backwards for you.

02:23.409 --> 02:24.877
[chuckles]

02:24.879 --> 02:27.279
And you won't even
help your [bleep] self.

02:27.281 --> 02:28.447
Bend over backwards my ass.

02:28.449 --> 02:29.548
You ain't done nothing,

02:29.550 --> 02:31.550
but run your [bleep] mouth
like always.

02:33.019 --> 02:35.154
Arguing with Amanda

02:35.156 --> 02:37.055
or Tammy, either one,
it doesn't matter.

02:37.991 --> 02:39.525
<i>Both of them,</i>

02:39.527 --> 02:41.793
<i>think they have
to have the last word.</i>

02:41.795 --> 02:44.830
Do you want either one
of them cussing you out?

02:44.832 --> 02:46.064
'Cause that's
what's gonna happen.

02:46.066 --> 02:47.499
'Cause if you try
to step in between them,

02:47.501 --> 02:49.168
they're both gonna cuss you.

02:51.304 --> 02:53.939
[Amanda] She wanna talk to me
like that in front of people.

02:53.941 --> 02:55.941
And my [bleep] bends over
backwards for her

02:55.943 --> 02:57.142
and she wanna sit up
and tell people, like,

02:57.144 --> 02:59.411
they lost their [bleep] mind.

02:59.413 --> 03:02.681
[Tammy] As usual, you'll make
[bleep] thing about you.

03:02.683 --> 03:04.183
So, I didn't wanna [bleep] come

03:04.185 --> 03:05.584
'cause I knew she would
run her mouth.

03:07.253 --> 03:10.222
[Amanda] We put up with
<i>that [bleep] when we were kids.</i>

03:10.224 --> 03:13.192
<i>I don't [bleep] have to come
here and put up with this [bleep].</i>

03:13.194 --> 03:16.061
I'm not gonna let nobody sit
and talk to me like that.

03:16.063 --> 03:17.930
I don't care who you are.

03:17.932 --> 03:20.299
<i>I don't know exactly
what her motivation is</i>

03:20.301 --> 03:22.167
<i>for coming at me like that.</i>

03:22.169 --> 03:24.303
We're all too grown for this.

03:24.305 --> 03:26.138
[chuckles] Just too grown
for it.

03:30.276 --> 03:31.577
I will kill her.

04:24.130 --> 04:26.231
That bitch was doing donuts
in the back

04:26.233 --> 04:28.000
of the parking lot
in that wheelchair.

04:31.170 --> 04:33.205
<i>[Chris Combs] That wheelchair
gave her so much freedom</i>

04:33.207 --> 04:35.007
<i>that she was not used to.</i>

04:42.081 --> 04:43.782
I knew there was gonna be drama.

04:43.784 --> 04:46.652
Well, I was hoping that there
wasn't gonna be dadgum drama.

04:46.654 --> 04:47.953
And you're the one
who started [bleep].

04:47.955 --> 04:49.254
I didn't start [bleep], she did,

04:49.256 --> 04:50.455
and I just finished it.

04:51.124 --> 04:52.824
<i>The whole dinner was ruined.</i>

04:52.826 --> 04:54.426
It was pretty much over
at that point.

04:59.132 --> 05:01.300
I wanna apologize
to you sisters real quick,

05:01.302 --> 05:03.402
I didn't mean for things
to get like that,

05:03.404 --> 05:06.004
but I'm just so sick
of the verbal abuse from her.

05:06.006 --> 05:08.273
I mean, it's mentally taxing,
like, it's sad.

05:08.275 --> 05:09.474
- [Amy] I know, right?
- It's sad.

05:09.476 --> 05:10.676
This is why...

05:11.344 --> 05:12.811
I put a...

05:12.813 --> 05:14.980
a bid to buy a house.

05:14.982 --> 05:16.815
- Oh you did? You did.
- [speaking indistinctly]

05:16.817 --> 05:18.383
- Oh, well, then you'll be closer to me.
- [Amy] Yeah.

05:18.385 --> 05:20.619
- Okay.
- Closer to mom and the other mom.

05:21.120 --> 05:22.421
Mom and Barb.

05:23.690 --> 05:26.825
So, Amy tells us that
she put a bid in

05:26.827 --> 05:30.495
on a house for her,
which is great.

05:30.497 --> 05:33.865
<i>But, I can see why it'd be
really upsetting for Tammy.</i>

05:33.867 --> 05:37.336
Because it's always been
Tammy and Amy.

05:38.671 --> 05:41.540
So, it's gonna be a lot
of changing happening

05:42.175 --> 05:43.675
for both for them.

05:43.677 --> 05:44.976
[Amanda] I'm so happy
for you sis,

05:44.978 --> 05:47.679
I really hope, I hope
the bid goes through.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.948
Me and Michael had made
an offer on the house...

05:52.352 --> 05:55.020
I'll be so happy
if we get this house.

05:55.022 --> 05:57.356
I can't wait to spend
the rest of my life

05:57.358 --> 05:59.124
in this house with my kid,

05:59.126 --> 06:01.860
my husband, my dog.

06:01.862 --> 06:04.863
<i>But, I still don't know what
we're gonna do with Tammy,</i>

06:04.865 --> 06:06.465
<i>I'm about over her [bleep].</i>

06:06.467 --> 06:07.866
When you drop her off,

06:07.868 --> 06:09.735
you have to come back
and pick us girls up.

06:09.737 --> 06:11.370
- [Chris] I know.
- And we'll--

06:11.372 --> 06:13.872
You realize, it's gonna be,
like, 30, 40 minutes?

06:13.874 --> 06:14.973
- Yeah.
- Yes.

06:14.975 --> 06:17.008
This is [bleep].

06:21.781 --> 06:23.248
Sis Tammy and Amanda
got into it,

06:23.250 --> 06:26.184
Tammy refuses to drive
with Amanda.

06:26.186 --> 06:29.321
<i>We gotta send the boys off,
to take her to the hotel...</i>

06:29.323 --> 06:30.489
Here you go Tammy.

06:30.491 --> 06:32.457
So, we're tryna
jump over hurdles

06:32.459 --> 06:34.092
just to please her.

06:35.061 --> 06:36.595
<i>I want her to feel included.</i>

06:37.230 --> 06:38.163
<i>But...</i>

06:55.915 --> 06:56.915
[Misty] What the heck is that?

06:56.917 --> 06:58.383
[Amanda] It's sun dried
tomato turkey.

06:58.951 --> 07:00.218
- Oh that's right, is it?
- Legit.

07:00.319 --> 07:02.687
Like, for real it is. Look how
much I paid for that [bleep].

07:02.689 --> 07:05.457
Last night, the fight between
Tammy and Amanda

07:06.259 --> 07:07.325
was [bleep].

07:07.760 --> 07:08.693
<i>But...</i>

07:15.968 --> 07:17.369
You know, and I'm not saying
my reactions

07:17.371 --> 07:18.837
to the way,
since things went down,

07:18.839 --> 07:20.705
since we've been here was right.

07:20.707 --> 07:22.340
And I'll fix that
on a personal level,

07:22.342 --> 07:24.009
I'll fix that with her.

07:24.011 --> 07:27.879
But, I was really honestly,
genuinely hoping that...

07:27.881 --> 07:30.549
she was actually coming
just to spend time with us.

07:31.951 --> 07:34.686
You know, I was really hoping
that she just really just missed us

07:34.688 --> 07:36.021
and wanted to be around us.

07:42.829 --> 07:44.563
<i>[Amy] Our friend Rob
got here late</i>

07:44.565 --> 07:47.165
and so, he stayed
at the cabin with us.

07:47.366 --> 07:48.400
<i>So, this morning,</i>

07:48.402 --> 07:50.368
<i>he's on his way
to go pick up Tammy.</i>

07:50.370 --> 07:51.870
We asked him to bring her back,

07:51.872 --> 07:54.072
so we can at least say
goodbye to her.

07:54.074 --> 07:56.141
Clear the air
before she goes back home.

08:04.484 --> 08:05.684
<i>[Rob] I'm Rob.</i>

08:05.686 --> 08:06.852
Um, I'm a family friend.

08:06.854 --> 08:07.886
I was Amanda's friend first

08:07.888 --> 08:09.988
and then I meet Tammy and Amy
a few weeks later.

08:09.990 --> 08:11.389
<i>Whenever the family calls me,</i>

08:11.391 --> 08:13.291
<i>you know, I'm just that person
that they need.</i>

08:13.293 --> 08:15.227
<i>And same, you know, with me,</i>

08:15.229 --> 08:17.062
<i>if I call them, you know,
they got me.</i>

08:17.064 --> 08:19.331
<i>And she needed me
to come and get her.</i>

08:19.333 --> 08:20.699
And that really sucks for her

08:20.701 --> 08:22.434
because, you know, she couldn't
have a great time with her family.

08:23.035 --> 08:24.069
[knock on door]

08:25.037 --> 08:26.037
Tam, Tam.

08:26.873 --> 08:27.939
Hey, babe.

08:29.141 --> 08:30.475
I'm here to come get you.

08:31.477 --> 08:33.144
How're you doing?

08:33.880 --> 08:34.980
You feel any better?

08:36.282 --> 08:37.883
Little bit?

08:37.885 --> 08:40.018
Well, I went to the cabin,
it's really nice.

08:40.020 --> 08:42.087
I left my stuff up there, so I
have to go back and get it.

08:42.089 --> 08:44.856
You wanna ride with me or
you're gonna stay here, yeah?

08:44.858 --> 08:46.091
All right, let's do this.
Come on.

09:14.220 --> 09:15.220
Hello, hello!

09:15.222 --> 09:16.254
- [Amanda] Hi, Rob.
- [Chris] Hey.

09:16.256 --> 09:17.188
Hey, how y'all doing?

09:17.190 --> 09:18.456
Whatcha doing?

09:18.458 --> 09:21.126
Man, I sat there, I tried
to talk her into staying,

09:21.128 --> 09:22.460
she's not tryna stay,

09:22.462 --> 09:23.962
Said, she's not feeling good.

09:24.196 --> 09:25.230
And yeah...

09:25.232 --> 09:26.698
[Amanda] I really appreciate
you coming.

09:26.700 --> 09:29.334
- We do.
- Oh, no problem, you know, I'll do it for y'all so.

09:29.336 --> 09:31.469
I'm going upstairs to get my
clothes in. I'll see y'all out there.

09:31.471 --> 09:32.871
- [Chris] All right.
- [Amanda] All right.

09:32.873 --> 09:34.172
All right, honey.

09:34.174 --> 09:36.875
The whole vacation
feels wrong because...

09:36.877 --> 09:38.510
<i>we wanted to spend
time together.</i>

09:38.512 --> 09:41.279
<i>There's gotta be something
going on with Tammy right now.</i>

09:41.881 --> 09:43.515
So, we're gonna go and see

09:43.517 --> 09:45.350
if we can figure out
what the hell is going on.

09:46.586 --> 09:47.652
What's up bitch?

09:52.058 --> 09:54.092
Oh hell, we are on vacation,
what do you expect?

10:05.938 --> 10:07.439
[laughs sarcastically]

10:09.141 --> 10:10.408
Don't wear that.

10:13.879 --> 10:15.880
I really wish you would stay,
I apologize for last night.

10:15.882 --> 10:17.282
It shouldn't even
had got that way

10:17.284 --> 10:19.117
We were just sitting there,
you know, sharing food [bleep].

10:19.119 --> 10:20.251
Next thing I know,

10:20.253 --> 10:22.153
we're both yelling
at each other.

10:22.155 --> 10:23.822
And I am sincerely sorry
for that sis.

10:23.824 --> 10:25.357
I don't, I don't even know
what came over me

10:25.359 --> 10:27.192
I guess, I was just
tired and [bleep].

10:28.194 --> 10:29.293
Tammy, when she gets upset,

10:29.295 --> 10:31.196
it's very hard for her to talk
about her feelings,

10:31.198 --> 10:33.798
I mean, matter of fact, all of us
siblings are pretty much the same way.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.000
<i>But, um...</i>

10:35.002 --> 10:37.335
<i>I do think that my reaction
was inappropriate</i>

10:37.337 --> 10:38.970
<i>and I'm gonna own that.</i>

10:38.972 --> 10:40.038
<i>When I'm in the wrong, I own it</i>

10:40.040 --> 10:41.139
<i>and I apologize,</i>

10:41.141 --> 10:43.141
<i>you know, and I try
to make it right.</i>

10:43.776 --> 10:45.377
But, I do wish you would stay.

10:52.018 --> 10:54.319
Yeah, yeah, I mean the altitude,
it is a little harder to breathe

10:54.321 --> 10:56.688
up on a mountain versus
it is down in the valley.

10:57.256 --> 10:58.790
So, I mean,
I can understand that.

10:59.125 --> 11:01.860
I wish you would have just told us
that, that night when we first got here,

11:01.862 --> 11:04.429
instead of just letting everything
transpire the way that it did.

11:07.633 --> 11:10.001
Both of y'all got mad
at me that night.

11:10.003 --> 11:11.970
You had plenty of opportunity.

11:18.878 --> 11:21.413
We started fighting,
I got mad...

11:21.415 --> 11:22.480
err!

11:24.250 --> 11:25.684
I really didn't feel good.

11:58.918 --> 12:00.652
Tammy, we're gonna miss you.

12:05.191 --> 12:06.391
It's gonna be all right,
we get home,

12:06.393 --> 12:08.326
I'll come check on you
when we get home, it'll be

12:08.328 --> 12:10.595
probably Sunday, 'cause
I'll be tired from coming in,

12:10.597 --> 12:12.163
but I'll be down
to check on you.

12:26.412 --> 12:27.545
All right.

12:36.689 --> 12:40.358
<i>More help than what we
as siblings can give you.</i>

12:41.227 --> 12:42.360
<i>Her body is so big,</i>

12:42.362 --> 12:44.662
<i>she can't do nothing,
she can't go nowhere.</i>

12:53.038 --> 12:54.439
We've all had a turn with Tammy

12:54.441 --> 12:56.007
each one of a sibling has.

12:56.009 --> 12:58.209
Yeah, what's next after me?

12:59.945 --> 13:01.946
That's the only thing left.

13:01.948 --> 13:03.848
I don't know what's gonna
happen with Tammy

13:03.850 --> 13:05.016
being out there by herself.

13:05.018 --> 13:06.417
But we're gonna
have to figure something out,

13:06.419 --> 13:07.585
- I know that.
- Yeah.

13:07.587 --> 13:11.322
Hey, go ahead, double fist it,
turn up, turn up, turn up.

13:15.261 --> 13:16.327
Maybe...

13:18.164 --> 13:19.264
Oh!

13:19.266 --> 13:21.366
[Rob] Oh, she on demons, time.

13:21.368 --> 13:22.534
- Damn--
- [Rob laughs]

13:31.143 --> 13:32.477
Oh!

13:35.181 --> 13:37.015
[baby cooing]

13:40.319 --> 13:41.386
Ew!

13:51.230 --> 13:53.331
[laughing]

14:12.852 --> 14:15.887
Are you, you all believers
in paranormal?

14:15.889 --> 14:18.056
You guys wanna do
some investigation yourself?

14:29.401 --> 14:31.169
They'll be like, oh!

14:31.171 --> 14:34.105
Nope, I'm good, no. I'm done.

14:34.107 --> 14:36.207
[man] One of you has to stand
on each side of the sign,

14:36.209 --> 14:37.942
when you get that picture.

14:37.944 --> 14:41.913
There is a story if a couple
goes up to the cemetery sign

14:41.915 --> 14:44.082
<i>and takes a picture
in front of it,</i>

14:44.084 --> 14:46.985
if the guy is unfaithful, there
will be a ghost appearing.

14:49.488 --> 14:50.955
[chuckles]

14:50.957 --> 14:52.390
- [man] Very interesting.
- Follow that.

14:52.392 --> 14:55.059
[man] You may have caught
some kind of dark entity.

14:55.061 --> 14:57.295
Yeah, it almost
looks like a cat.

14:57.297 --> 14:59.864
[Amy] We have a cat ghost
in our house.

14:59.866 --> 15:01.532
- You got a ghost cat?
- Yeah.

15:01.534 --> 15:02.967
- It runs back and forth...
- [man] Does it?

15:02.969 --> 15:04.502
Between my sister and my house.

15:04.504 --> 15:06.204
It's a Siamese cat.

15:09.308 --> 15:10.508
Oh, that was Gage.

15:11.110 --> 15:12.510
[man laughs]

15:15.981 --> 15:17.315
Gage agrees.

15:20.886 --> 15:21.953
Oh my damn!

15:22.288 --> 15:23.221
[Amanda] Okay.

15:24.690 --> 15:27.091
<i>[Amy] Tammy got home
safe yesterday,</i>

15:27.093 --> 15:29.694
so we're all just relaxing
by the hot tub

15:29.696 --> 15:31.729
<i>and we're just having fun.</i>

15:31.731 --> 15:34.132
And it's really nice
and peaceful.

15:34.134 --> 15:36.200
So, what you guys doing
out here before we come out?

15:36.202 --> 15:38.569
[Amy] We're just talking about
the old Tammy photos

15:38.571 --> 15:40.271
and the roller coaster
and stuff.

15:40.273 --> 15:42.307
Those family photos
turned out really good.

15:42.309 --> 15:44.776
- I really liked all of them.
- [Amanda] Yeah.

15:44.778 --> 15:46.945
I've been meaning to tell y'all,

15:46.947 --> 15:50.214
uh, they accepted our offer
on the house.

15:50.216 --> 15:51.215
Your what now?

15:51.217 --> 15:53.952
We go sign papers
in a couple days.

15:53.954 --> 15:55.453
So, you guys are
gonna buy a house?

15:55.455 --> 15:57.522
- Like you're really buying a house?
- [Michael Halterman] Yeah.

15:57.524 --> 15:59.691
- Yeah.
- [Amanda] Oh, that's good.

16:00.326 --> 16:01.459
Congratulations.

16:01.461 --> 16:02.660
I'm really proud of y'all.

16:02.662 --> 16:04.262
You know, that was one
of my dreams,

16:04.264 --> 16:06.798
have a son
and provide him a house.

16:06.800 --> 16:08.066
The forever home.

16:08.068 --> 16:10.468
I'm extremely excited
they got the house

16:10.470 --> 16:13.738
She's really excited and I
see that little twinkle in her eye.

16:13.740 --> 16:15.006
And I'm super excited for her.

16:15.008 --> 16:17.275
And then, you know, Gage
is gonna get to grow up there.

16:17.277 --> 16:18.910
<i>I'm really proud
of both of them.</i>

16:18.912 --> 16:20.345
Michael and Amy both.

16:20.347 --> 16:23.414
They have really come
a long way.

16:23.416 --> 16:24.849
[Misty] So, when you're moving?

16:24.851 --> 16:26.684
Well, the house needs
a lot of work.

16:26.686 --> 16:28.720
It needs fresh coat of paint,

16:28.722 --> 16:29.987
some flooring,

16:29.989 --> 16:32.557
stuff like that, it's gonna take
us, what, a couple months.

16:32.559 --> 16:35.393
With you moving, what we're
gonna do with the Tammy situation?

16:35.395 --> 16:36.661
I don't know.

16:38.097 --> 16:41.032
Tisa's been helping me
out a lot.

16:41.034 --> 16:43.634
- That's Tammy's nurse that comes home to help her.
- [Amy] Yeah.

16:44.403 --> 16:46.704
- Tisa's not for everything.
- Yeah.

16:47.473 --> 16:49.640
Tisa only comes in
a couple days a week.

16:56.582 --> 16:58.216
I'm not gonna be at her
beck and calls,

16:58.218 --> 16:59.851
so you might as well
forget that [bleep].

16:59.853 --> 17:03.121
Now, I'll go over and help her
if she needs too, but this...

17:03.123 --> 17:05.323
dropping what I'm doing
on a whim, I'm not doing it.

17:05.325 --> 17:08.960
I have a life to live of my own.

17:08.962 --> 17:11.429
[Amy] Well, I was hoping it'll give
Tammy the motivation she needs

17:11.431 --> 17:13.197
to get off her ass
and do something.

17:13.665 --> 17:14.565
I know.

17:14.567 --> 17:16.701
I just don't see
that happening right now.

17:16.703 --> 17:17.668
[Amy] I don't either.

17:18.404 --> 17:20.872
<i>[Amanda] When Amy moves, I mean,</i>

17:20.874 --> 17:22.306
she's not gonna have somebody
right next to her,

17:22.308 --> 17:25.109
It's gonna be at least 30 minutes
before one of us could get to her.

17:25.111 --> 17:26.277
<i>I don't know what's gonna happen</i>

17:26.279 --> 17:28.079
<i>with Tammy being out there
by herself.</i>

17:28.081 --> 17:30.481
- But we've gonna figure something out, I know that.
- Yeah.

17:31.917 --> 17:33.918
I don't know, I guess,
the whole Tammy conversation

17:33.920 --> 17:35.086
is to be continued as always

17:35.088 --> 17:36.888
'cause don't nobody ever have
a damn solution,

17:36.890 --> 17:38.790
when we come up with
something, it just gets...

17:38.792 --> 17:41.225
Put her ass in a state home
and let them deal with her.

17:43.028 --> 17:45.196
Okay, then what options
is there?

17:47.466 --> 17:49.067
We've all had a turn with Tammy

17:49.069 --> 17:50.501
each one of our siblings has.

17:54.039 --> 17:55.206
That's only thing left.

17:56.775 --> 17:59.043
<i>[Amy] We're not really
coming up with any solutions,</i>

17:59.045 --> 18:01.879
but who's coming over
to check on Tammy,

18:01.881 --> 18:04.182
shouldn't be a problem to solve.

18:04.184 --> 18:06.050
They should wanna help me

18:06.052 --> 18:08.019
in taking care of our sister.

18:08.021 --> 18:10.922
Yes, they did it themselves
but...

18:10.924 --> 18:13.257
I was too young
to take care of everything.

18:13.259 --> 18:16.294
<i>And now, I'm not gonna be there.</i>

18:25.804 --> 18:26.938
<i>[Amanda] Am I really [bleep].</i>

18:26.940 --> 18:29.173
Michael and Amy bought us
a game to play

18:29.175 --> 18:30.942
and we didn't even
get to play it.

18:30.944 --> 18:32.043
[Chris chuckles]

18:35.080 --> 18:37.014
[Amanda] Oh, hold on,
unlock the door.

18:41.086 --> 18:43.754
<i>[Amy] I can't believe that we're
leaving here, it is gorgeous.</i>

18:43.756 --> 18:45.923
I'll tell you one thing, I ain't
gonna miss, that damn stairs

18:45.925 --> 18:48.292
- going up down 20,000 times a day.
- I got you girl.

18:48.294 --> 18:51.462
- [Amanda] We was building up our dare years, I guess.
- [Misty] Uh-huh.

18:51.464 --> 18:53.464
[Chris] Back to the nine
to five baby.

18:57.402 --> 18:59.570
<i>[Amy] I consider this vacation</i>

18:59.572 --> 19:01.072
very successful,

19:01.074 --> 19:04.275
we came out here, we did
all the things we wanted to do,

19:04.277 --> 19:07.044
even though some of us
didn't wanna join in the fun.

19:07.646 --> 19:08.679
<i>Gatlinburg,</i>

19:08.681 --> 19:11.215
<i>we came, we saw, we conquered.
[chuckles]</i>

19:11.217 --> 19:13.050
<i>And now Kentucky, here we come.</i>

19:13.352 --> 19:15.286
[Amy] Home sweet home.

19:15.288 --> 19:18.122
But now, there's only
one thing on my mind,

19:18.124 --> 19:21.025
[bleep], I gotta tell Tammy,
I'm moving out.

19:24.396 --> 19:27.899
<i>I have no idea
how Tammy's gonna react.</i>

19:27.901 --> 19:30.134
But, me and Michael
got this house,

19:30.136 --> 19:32.937
we have to tell Tammy
as soon as we get home.

19:44.716 --> 19:45.783
Speaking of trips,

19:45.951 --> 19:49.053
I ain't gonna be able to go
on trips for a while.

19:49.055 --> 19:50.120
<i>My problem is,</i>

19:50.122 --> 19:52.356
don't know which side
of Tammy you're gonna get,

19:52.358 --> 19:55.526
the nice one, the mean one or
the one that will cut your head off.

19:55.528 --> 19:57.295
I just made an offer
on the house

19:57.297 --> 19:59.430
and they accepted it.

20:09.908 --> 20:12.376
Me, Michael and Gage got
home really late, last night

20:12.378 --> 20:15.680
we were so tired,
so we just all crashed.

20:15.682 --> 20:17.982
<i>So, today we took
the trailer back,</i>

20:17.984 --> 20:19.183
<i>we picked up little bit</i>

20:19.185 --> 20:21.118
<i>and now we're gonna go
check on Tammy.</i>

20:32.197 --> 20:34.232
So, I've told everybody
that we're moving,

20:35.234 --> 20:36.634
but Tammy...

20:37.869 --> 20:39.637
It's time to rip off
the band aid and say,

20:42.207 --> 20:43.841
[Tammy] Hi, weirdo!

20:43.843 --> 20:46.110
- [Amy] Girl, I'm tired.
- I bet.

20:47.145 --> 20:49.247
Here, I brought you some food.

20:51.817 --> 20:54.051
I'm kind of nervous
because it's like,

20:54.053 --> 20:55.686
kind of scary
'cause you don't know

20:55.688 --> 20:57.688
which side of Tammy
you're gonna get,

20:57.690 --> 20:59.123
the nice one,

20:59.125 --> 21:01.325
the mean one or the one
that will cut your head off.

21:07.266 --> 21:08.566
[Amy] How was your trip home?

21:11.103 --> 21:13.170
I'm so tired from the vacation.

21:17.142 --> 21:18.376
Mm-mm.

21:18.378 --> 21:20.278
- [Tammy] What?
- Nobody fought but you.

21:35.294 --> 21:36.427
Yeah, but,

21:36.429 --> 21:39.130
you didn't had to draw it out
into a big fight.

21:39.132 --> 21:41.799
- I wasn't trying to--
- You could have told us just,

21:41.801 --> 21:44.035
"Hey, I can't breathe
because of the altitude."

22:08.260 --> 22:09.960
- Nobody--
- [Tammy] Y'all hear one thing

22:09.962 --> 22:11.228
and y'all go with it.

22:11.230 --> 22:13.964
Y'all don't care to listen
to the whole thing.

22:13.966 --> 22:16.901
- Amanda and Misty-- - [Amy] Cause
you sometimes don't share the whole thing.

22:16.903 --> 22:18.669
You're doing it now,
I'm tryna tell you

22:18.671 --> 22:20.071
and you cut me off.

22:30.382 --> 22:31.949
[Tammy] You all do it.

22:33.118 --> 22:35.052
Every single one
of y'all cut me off

22:35.054 --> 22:37.188
before I can tell anything.

22:37.190 --> 22:39.390
And then you wanna get mad
because I'm not talking.

22:39.392 --> 22:41.258
How the [bleep] can I talk?

22:41.260 --> 22:43.127
We weren't doing it on purpose.

22:43.129 --> 22:46.964
- You don't do it.
- [Amy] Sometimes we just don't realize we're doing it.

22:50.035 --> 22:53.070
Well, take a [bleep] breath,
let other people talk.

22:53.805 --> 22:55.373
[clears throat]

22:55.375 --> 22:58.476
- So, how do you feel now that you're home at least?
- [Tammy] Better.

22:59.544 --> 23:01.379
Not 100, but I'm better.

23:11.390 --> 23:12.957
Because...

23:12.959 --> 23:14.692
I just made an offer
on the house.

23:14.694 --> 23:16.093
And they accepted it.

23:19.097 --> 23:21.031
So, we're gonna move soon.

23:36.314 --> 23:38.516
It's got like this much...

23:39.284 --> 23:40.384
porch.

23:40.386 --> 23:42.620
So, we're gonna put,
like, a little...

23:51.196 --> 23:54.298
And has four bedrooms,
it's right near park.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.401
And Gage has his own room,

23:57.403 --> 23:59.203
he ain't gotta
sleep in the kitchen.

23:59.205 --> 24:01.672
I got a office, a spare bedroom.

24:03.041 --> 24:05.843
It's got a huge laundry room
with kitchen, you know,

24:05.845 --> 24:07.478
big ass dining room.

24:09.181 --> 24:12.016
I wanna get a family
picnic table and put it there.

24:27.199 --> 24:29.934
I wanna make sure my kid
don't have to go through,

24:30.469 --> 24:32.002
"where am I gonna live."

24:33.505 --> 24:34.972
[Amy] Raise Gage--

25:09.374 --> 25:11.175
She says, she's happy for me,

25:11.177 --> 25:14.311
but at the end, I know,
it's hard for her.

25:14.313 --> 25:15.513
[Amy]
<i>Tammy might not admit it,</i>

25:15.515 --> 25:17.281
<i>but she wants me to stick around</i>

25:17.283 --> 25:20.684
because she's scared
of being by herself.

25:20.686 --> 25:23.320
Last time she was alone
by herself,

25:23.322 --> 25:25.256
she ended up with pneumonia

25:25.258 --> 25:27.091
<i>and ended up on life support.</i>

25:27.692 --> 25:28.626
But...

25:40.906 --> 25:42.206
[JT] This pizza is banging.

25:42.208 --> 25:43.240
It's slapping.

25:43.242 --> 25:44.575
<i>[Tammy] I'm aware</i>

25:44.577 --> 25:47.077
that I'm doing more damage
to my body.

25:47.079 --> 25:48.846
<i>I'm completely aware.</i>

25:48.848 --> 25:51.382
- [Rob] To the queen.
- To the queen.

26:03.194 --> 26:05.696
<i>[Amy] Now that I've told Tammy
that we are moving,</i>

26:05.698 --> 26:07.331
<i>I feel less stress.</i>

26:12.971 --> 26:15.272
<i>But, realistically,
we can't move in</i>

26:15.274 --> 26:17.141
<i>till all the renovations
are done.</i>

26:17.143 --> 26:18.776
<i>You know, we got flooring
to lay,</i>

26:18.778 --> 26:20.311
<i>we got painting to do.</i>

26:26.284 --> 26:29.486
Hey y'all, it's Amy and Gageru.

26:29.488 --> 26:31.989
And we got some
exciting news to tell y'all.

26:32.390 --> 26:34.058
We're moving!

26:34.060 --> 26:35.893
We bought a house,

26:35.895 --> 26:40.097
and Gage has his very,
very own special room.

26:40.099 --> 26:43.200
And as parents, we wanna
keep him involved

26:43.202 --> 26:44.835
with making plans.

26:44.837 --> 26:46.904
And Gage knows what he likes.

26:46.906 --> 26:49.273
He picks out
what he wants to eat,

26:49.275 --> 26:52.076
he picks out
what outfit he wants.

26:58.783 --> 27:00.217
[chuckles]

27:10.261 --> 27:12.129
How you know
if a baby likes something,

27:12.131 --> 27:14.565
they'll either touch it
or they'll--

27:16.935 --> 27:18.535
[laughs]

27:19.804 --> 27:24.041
Yeah they're touching it
and they're exploring it.

27:24.043 --> 27:26.510
So, that's the one,
I say, he chooses.

27:29.681 --> 27:32.249
You wanna pick a color
for your bedroom?

27:39.290 --> 27:40.357
You want this one

27:41.326 --> 27:42.326
this one,

27:43.094 --> 27:44.028
or this one?

27:55.573 --> 27:57.141
That one? Let me see it.

27:57.143 --> 27:58.609
Let mommy see it.

28:01.212 --> 28:04.014
So, he picked water tone.

28:04.016 --> 28:05.683
I mean, I would have
got it lighter,

28:05.685 --> 28:08.118
but it was all his choice, so...

28:11.156 --> 28:12.990
We'll talk to you guys later,
have a nice day.

28:12.992 --> 28:15.025
Bye YouTube, please subscribe.

28:17.095 --> 28:19.196
I'm so glad
we bought this house.

28:28.973 --> 28:30.908
- We're moving-- - [Amy]
I mean, she's proud of us,

28:30.910 --> 28:33.610
but you know her,
she downplays a lot.

28:36.347 --> 28:39.049
I'm hoping when me
and Michael move out,

28:39.051 --> 28:42.052
<i>that Tammy will step up
and do what's right</i>

28:42.054 --> 28:44.254
<i>'cause she'll have to.</i>

28:44.256 --> 28:47.758
So, maybe, this a little
motivation for her.

28:47.760 --> 28:50.694
You know, I'm not gonna
be right next to her anymore.

28:50.696 --> 28:52.730
You're gonna have to take care
of your own [bleep].

29:05.210 --> 29:07.077
I got the door for you Tam, Tam.

29:08.012 --> 29:09.713
[JT] You're ready.
Let's go, girl,

29:10.849 --> 29:11.949
to the yoyo.

29:15.220 --> 29:16.620
There you go, Tam, Tam.

29:27.065 --> 29:28.398
I'ma go ahead
and get into the car.

29:29.934 --> 29:31.268
[coughing]

29:38.409 --> 29:40.511
Y'all ready for a road trip?

29:40.513 --> 29:42.112
Yeah, yeah.

29:42.114 --> 29:45.149
- Hell yeah!
- Okay!

29:45.151 --> 29:48.519
<i>[Tammy] We've just been
drinking, vaping.</i>

29:49.554 --> 29:52.456
As a teenager
I wasn't doing any partying.

30:19.050 --> 30:20.117
[Rob] Okay.

30:21.052 --> 30:22.352
- Okay, sure.
- [Ralph] Gang, gang.

30:26.191 --> 30:27.357
My friendship with Tammy is,

30:27.359 --> 30:29.159
I feel like it's completely
different, like,

30:29.161 --> 30:30.694
<i>I don't know,
we just have a good time.</i>

30:30.696 --> 30:32.963
Every time we're together, we
always tryna have a great time.

30:32.965 --> 30:34.198
I love it.

30:37.068 --> 30:40.037
<i>[Rob] I mean, I understand
that, you know, health wise,</i>

30:40.039 --> 30:42.973
but I'm like, I feel like, when I
come around, like, it's just, you know,

30:42.975 --> 30:43.907
to get all that stress off her,

30:43.909 --> 30:45.242
have a good time.

30:45.244 --> 30:47.010
<i>You know, she doesn't have
to worry about anything,</i>

30:47.012 --> 30:48.679
<i>we just have a good time
together.</i>

30:48.681 --> 30:50.681
<i>[JT] Tam, Tam, we're home.</i>

30:50.683 --> 30:52.916
- We're gonna party tonight.
- [all chuckling]

30:52.918 --> 30:53.951
[Ralph] Oh, yeah.

30:53.953 --> 30:56.053
Help Tam, Tam out the car.

31:07.031 --> 31:09.099
[Tammy] So, what kind of
drinks we got? Y'all make me one.

31:09.101 --> 31:10.234
We can make some screwdrivers,

31:10.236 --> 31:11.301
margaritas,

31:11.303 --> 31:13.170
- we got moonshine.
- Oh.

31:33.258 --> 31:36.326
- Tam, Tam, you want a piece of pizza?
- Yeah.

31:36.328 --> 31:38.161
- Thank you.
- Here you go.

31:57.048 --> 31:59.216
[cell phone ringing]

31:59.218 --> 32:00.350
[Rob] Girl, you got
a phone call.

32:00.352 --> 32:03.153
[cell phone ringing]

32:03.155 --> 32:04.321
- [Rob] Who is it?
- I need to know.

32:05.857 --> 32:07.157
[Rob] You want to talk
to your sister?

32:07.859 --> 32:09.226
I love you Amy.

32:09.228 --> 32:10.961
- Even though you can't hear me.
- We love you,

32:10.963 --> 32:12.195
- but I'm busy.
- [Ralph] Bye Amy,

32:12.197 --> 32:14.331
- bye Amy.
- [both chuckle]

32:20.171 --> 32:22.372
I love your family doll.

32:22.374 --> 32:25.108
- I mean, I love you too.
- We love you.

32:25.110 --> 32:26.376
- [Rob] I love you too.
- I love you too.

32:26.378 --> 32:27.411
[Rob] Kiss, kiss.

32:27.413 --> 32:28.378
Wait, are you making her drink?

32:28.380 --> 32:29.479
[Ralph] I don't know.

32:29.481 --> 32:30.914
[Rob] She just asked me to
make her a drink.

32:30.916 --> 32:31.782
[Ralph] But I didn't make.

32:31.784 --> 32:32.816
Okay, I'll drink both.

32:32.818 --> 32:34.384
- [indistinct chatter]
- [Ralph] Wait.

32:34.386 --> 32:37.454
- [speaking indistinctly]
- It's that kind of party.

32:37.456 --> 32:39.189
- That's not bad, but you drink.
- It's not bad,

32:39.191 --> 32:41.892
but I felt, like, it could
have tasted better.

32:41.894 --> 32:43.694
- [Rob] It's not bad at all.
- [Ralph] It could taste better.

32:43.696 --> 32:46.897
[Rob] Go ahead. Double
fist it. Yeah, turn on, turn on.

32:46.899 --> 32:48.065
- Mix it.
- [Rob] At the same time

32:48.067 --> 32:49.900
- I like it.
- [Rob] I like it, too.

32:49.902 --> 32:50.968
- I like it.
- [Rob] Do 'em together now.

32:50.970 --> 32:52.135
Oh!

32:52.137 --> 32:54.171
[Rob] Oh! She's on demon time.

32:54.173 --> 32:55.472
- Demon.
- [Rob chuckles]

32:56.074 --> 32:57.374
[Rob] Did you say demon?

32:57.376 --> 32:59.109
- I like it.
- [Rob chuckles]

33:17.862 --> 33:19.029
- Cheers.
- [Rob] To the queen.

33:19.031 --> 33:20.931
- To the queen.
- Queen.

33:20.933 --> 33:22.232
- Spirit water.
- There you go.

33:26.504 --> 33:29.539
- [Ralph] Are you feeling drunk yet?
- No.

33:30.942 --> 33:32.743
<i>[Amy] Here we are,
here's my house.</i>

33:32.745 --> 33:35.145
See how low the steps are.

33:35.147 --> 33:37.180
- [Amy] Do you think, you can do those?
- No.

33:37.182 --> 33:38.815
No, I'm not starting an argument

33:38.817 --> 33:40.350
to make her come into my house.

34:21.192 --> 34:22.926
If she works her mind to it,

34:22.928 --> 34:25.362
she can have all this,
she can have her own house.

34:26.464 --> 34:28.198
<i>Here we are, here's my house.</i>

34:30.468 --> 34:32.602
[Tammy speaking]

34:49.420 --> 34:51.054
[Amy] There's a laundry room,

34:51.056 --> 34:54.391
a YouTube room,
a toilet, our bedroom,

34:54.393 --> 34:56.493
Gage's room, a living room,

34:56.495 --> 34:58.695
a dining room,
and then the kitchen.

34:58.697 --> 35:02.232
You only have one toilet,
all these other rooms?

35:02.234 --> 35:05.368
Just me, him,
and Gage right now, so...

35:05.370 --> 35:08.105
Yeah, until, you get all
the family here.

35:08.107 --> 35:09.673
Get out of the way,
I gotta poop.

35:09.675 --> 35:10.540
[Amy chuckles]

35:10.542 --> 35:12.242
This is my damn house bitch,

35:12.244 --> 35:14.444
welcome to my house.

35:14.446 --> 35:16.446
<i>And now that I have more space,</i>

35:16.448 --> 35:18.215
<i>I wanna invite people over</i>

35:18.217 --> 35:21.084
<i>and make memories
together here, at our house,</i>

35:21.086 --> 35:23.687
like we did at Amanda's
and Misty's and Chris's,

35:23.689 --> 35:26.123
I want that same feeling here,
at my house.

35:26.125 --> 35:28.492
So, we're making sure
Tammy can get in the house

35:28.494 --> 35:31.027
with no hassles
is important to me.

35:31.029 --> 35:32.462
See how low the steps are?

35:44.375 --> 35:46.309
Are you worried that our house,

35:46.311 --> 35:48.612
like the doors are to small
for you to fit through?

35:50.148 --> 35:51.515
No.

35:51.517 --> 35:53.517
I'm not either because
we're about the same size

35:53.519 --> 35:55.185
as yours, at your house.

36:03.060 --> 36:04.060
Yeah.

36:05.096 --> 36:06.229
And...

36:32.356 --> 36:34.291
<i>If you were showing me
the house right now,</i>

36:34.293 --> 36:35.258
<i>my ass will be in there,</i>

36:35.260 --> 36:36.626
<i>I'll be like, "Girl, I love you,</i>

36:36.628 --> 36:38.695
<i>I'm proud of you,
you rock this."</i>

36:46.971 --> 36:49.306
Um, we're gonna go in and
check the progress on the house

36:49.308 --> 36:51.174
and we'll be right back.

36:51.176 --> 36:52.676
- [Amy] Can we shut the door?
- Yeah.

37:12.096 --> 37:13.496
[Amy]
This room is done, right?

37:19.136 --> 37:20.136
Yeah.

37:20.138 --> 37:23.240
- And kitchen is done.
- The kitchen is done.

37:23.242 --> 37:25.175
- Except for cleaning.
- Yeah.

37:25.177 --> 37:26.710
All right, the living room...

37:26.712 --> 37:29.145
- It's almost done.
- It's done.

37:29.147 --> 37:32.349
I think, the new house
will be a perfect fit for us

37:32.351 --> 37:35.318
because there is lots of space.

37:35.320 --> 37:37.020
It's got a little bit of a yard,

37:37.022 --> 37:39.889
we can have, like,
family over in the yard.

37:39.891 --> 37:42.192
I think they did a great job
with this paint.

37:42.194 --> 37:43.660
- Yeah, yeah.
- And in here,

37:43.662 --> 37:45.061
this is our room,

37:45.063 --> 37:47.163
it's basically,
ready for flooring.

37:47.165 --> 37:48.164
[Michael] Yeah,

37:55.306 --> 37:56.339
[Michael] Yeah.

37:56.341 --> 37:58.041
It's a place to call our home

37:58.043 --> 37:59.943
and not say,
"Oh, I'm a renter."

37:59.945 --> 38:01.611
This is ours, we own it.

38:02.680 --> 38:05.615
- This would be perfect for the office.
- Yeah.

38:10.688 --> 38:12.689
- I don't know.
- Why is she just staying in the car?

38:13.224 --> 38:14.357
[Amy] I mean it just sucks

38:14.359 --> 38:18.228
'cause we're moving on
and we got a house now.

38:18.230 --> 38:20.964
We got so much
going on in there.

38:20.966 --> 38:23.767
I feel, like, Tammy is kind of
jealous in a way.

38:23.769 --> 38:25.969
- Mmm.
- But, she needs to think of her health,

38:25.971 --> 38:27.971
- instead of partying.
- Yeah, yeah.

38:30.107 --> 38:32.075
I mean, I get it, when I was...

38:32.877 --> 38:34.678
twenty-three, I quit partying,

38:34.680 --> 38:37.180
quit drinking,
quit doing everything.

38:37.182 --> 38:40.550
She never got to
live out her 20s.

38:40.552 --> 38:43.153
<i>I'm not happy
Tammy's partying so much,</i>

38:43.387 --> 38:44.854
<i>but...</i>

38:44.856 --> 38:47.691
at the same time, I'm not
gonna confront her about it

38:47.693 --> 38:49.959
because it's Tammy's choice

38:49.961 --> 38:52.862
to make good choices, not mine.

38:52.864 --> 38:56.466
<i>Besides, I know, it's gonna
end up in a bad argument.</i>

38:56.468 --> 38:59.069
<i>And at this point,
she's gonna win.</i>

38:59.071 --> 39:00.437
So, I might well just
let her drink

39:00.439 --> 39:02.005
and cut out the middleman.

39:05.976 --> 39:07.010
Yeah.

39:12.550 --> 39:14.317
Right now,
it kinda feels like Tammy

39:14.319 --> 39:16.286
is more interested

39:16.288 --> 39:18.521
<i>in drinking and partying than...</i>

39:21.425 --> 39:23.593
<i>Like, I'm going one way,
she's going another.</i>

39:33.571 --> 39:34.537
[coughs]

39:36.207 --> 39:37.474
[coughing]

39:39.110 --> 39:41.111
<i>[Ralph] Give it to Amy.</i>

39:42.380 --> 39:44.314
- Make it sound like [speaking
indistinctly] - Mmm. It's okay.

39:44.316 --> 39:45.482
[speaking indistinctly]

39:45.484 --> 39:46.616
- [Rob] Yeah.
- [Tammy laughs]

39:57.361 --> 39:58.461
[gasps and chuckles]

40:02.400 --> 40:03.700
<i>[Rob] To the queen.</i>

40:03.702 --> 40:06.302
[indistinct shouting]

40:07.405 --> 40:09.539
- [man] Goddamn!
- [all laughing]

40:16.881 --> 40:18.148
[Tammy] I am...

40:28.259 --> 40:29.659
So, I just...

40:32.396 --> 40:33.630
tryna be happy.

40:40.371 --> 40:41.337
[Amy] But...

41:06.697 --> 41:08.665
It can cause kidney failure.

41:10.034 --> 41:11.334
I'm not trying to lecture you.

41:11.336 --> 41:14.404
I'm just trying to help you.

41:19.510 --> 41:22.178
<i>[Chris] Next time on
1000-lb Sisters...</i>

41:22.180 --> 41:24.380
<i>[Amy] Okay, bye-bye Kentucky.</i>

41:24.382 --> 41:27.417
<i>Flying would never
be on the table</i>

41:27.419 --> 41:29.219
before my gastric bypass.

41:29.221 --> 41:30.286
<i>Holy [bleep].</i>

41:30.288 --> 41:32.088
This is real,
this is going down.

41:37.061 --> 41:38.294
- Hey guys.
- Hello.

41:38.296 --> 41:39.662
[Chris] How you're doing doctor?

41:39.897 --> 41:41.664
<i>[Dr Eric Smith] Chris is
three months out after surgery,</i>

41:41.666 --> 41:44.968
so I would love to see
Chris get below 350.

41:44.970 --> 41:46.302
Let's step on the scale,

41:46.304 --> 41:47.804
I wanna see some numbers.

41:47.806 --> 41:49.138
Um...

41:50.875 --> 41:51.941
Do you wanna have more babies,

41:51.943 --> 41:53.409
- what's the plan there?
- One more.

41:53.411 --> 41:54.844
- [Charles Procter] One more baby?
- Yeah.

41:54.846 --> 41:56.112
What's the timeline for that?

41:58.382 --> 42:01.217
Soon, because, yeah.

42:01.219 --> 42:03.353
- How soon you think, you might be pregnant?
- Yeah.

42:04.255 --> 42:05.922
<i>[Amanda] I don't feel like,</i>

42:05.924 --> 42:09.125
the Tammy that is right here
is the best of who you are.

42:09.127 --> 42:11.294
<i>I think, that she hears
what I say,</i>

42:11.296 --> 42:13.196
I think, that she doesn't
wanna face the fact

42:13.198 --> 42:15.131
that her health is that bad.

42:15.133 --> 42:16.933
And I just don't want you
to give up.

42:16.935 --> 42:18.234
I'm not giving up,

42:18.236 --> 42:19.936
I just wanna be...

42:21.238 --> 42:22.705
happy for once.
