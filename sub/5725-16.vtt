WEBVTT

00:01.335 --> 00:03.371
God bless you,
and thank you for tuning in.

00:03.404 --> 00:05.106
(muffled grunting nearby)
Today...

00:05.139 --> 00:08.276
I'm gonna talk to you
about resisting temptation.

00:08.309 --> 00:10.711
Now, we all know
the story from the Bible

00:10.744 --> 00:13.047
of David and Goliath.

00:13.081 --> 00:15.183
(muffled grunting continues)
Champion of the Philistines

00:15.216 --> 00:18.319
versus a much smaller,
weaker opponent,

00:18.352 --> 00:21.289
who simply had the courage
to face him.

00:21.322 --> 00:22.290
(muffled panting)

00:22.323 --> 00:23.591
You see...

00:23.624 --> 00:26.360
David already knew
he had the victory.

00:26.394 --> 00:29.363
He had God on his side.

00:29.397 --> 00:32.733
(muffled grunting)
Goliath can be like that sin

00:32.766 --> 00:34.568
in your life that is

00:34.602 --> 00:37.605
most difficult for you
to overcome, but you...

00:37.638 --> 00:40.341
you can be like David.

00:40.374 --> 00:41.542
With God on your side...

00:41.575 --> 00:44.312
you can slay your giant

00:44.345 --> 00:46.447
and live a life free from sin.

00:46.480 --> 00:48.382
(muffled grunting)

00:48.416 --> 00:50.184
The only question is:

00:50.218 --> 00:52.520
Which sin is your Goliath?

00:52.553 --> 00:55.356
(muffled panting)

00:55.389 --> 00:57.191
*

01:01.262 --> 01:03.831
(phones ringing, beeping;
overlapping conversations)

01:03.864 --> 01:04.765
WOMAN: Did you get this?

01:04.798 --> 01:08.136
MAN: Yeah. What is it?

01:08.169 --> 01:09.403
I don't follow this person.

01:09.437 --> 01:10.838
You got this?
What is this?

01:10.871 --> 01:13.141
What's going on?
Is there an AMBER Alert?

01:13.174 --> 01:14.708
Nothing came up on my phone.

01:14.742 --> 01:15.743
It's an alert from PicThread.

01:15.776 --> 01:17.478
Ah. Well, that
explains it--

01:17.511 --> 01:18.779
I don't do social media.

01:18.812 --> 01:21.282
NELSON: "New post from:
Homestead Harrison"?

01:21.315 --> 01:23.451
I don't follow anyone
named Homestead Harrison.

01:23.484 --> 01:25.486
Neither do I.
RYAN: Well, it looks like

01:25.519 --> 01:27.721
this guy sent an alert
to everyone here.

01:27.755 --> 01:29.690
What the...? Raven, are
you seeing this photo?

01:29.723 --> 01:31.425
No, it's not just everyone
in this room.

01:31.459 --> 01:34.262
Every single user on PicThread
received this photo.

01:35.396 --> 01:37.231
Is this a hoax?

01:37.265 --> 01:38.832
No.

01:38.866 --> 01:41.535
Lividity,
coloring in his fingertips,

01:41.569 --> 01:43.537
purple suggests death, so...

01:43.571 --> 01:46.240
either someone's paying
a lot of attention to detail,

01:46.274 --> 01:47.708
or that guy's definitely dead.

01:47.741 --> 01:49.410
Who posted this?

01:49.443 --> 01:50.811
Um...

01:50.844 --> 01:54.582
Aiden Harrison.
Profile says he lives in Boston.

01:54.615 --> 01:56.517
Check it out.
This post is geo-tagged.

01:56.550 --> 01:57.751
MUNDO:
You have to choose to show

01:57.785 --> 02:00.254
your location on PicThread--
the app doesn't do it for you.

02:00.288 --> 02:01.889
RYAN:
So this Aiden Harrison--
he wanted us

02:01.922 --> 02:03.391
to know where
this photo was taken.

02:03.424 --> 02:07.195
NELSON: Geo-tag says
it's a church in Boston.

02:11.532 --> 02:13.734
(sirens wailing, whooping)

02:13.767 --> 02:17.538
*

02:28.849 --> 02:31.285
MUNDO: It's Aiden Harrison.

02:31.319 --> 02:32.820
Looks like
he's been here a while.

02:32.853 --> 02:34.422
Two or three days,

02:34.455 --> 02:37.491
just from the...
looks and smell of it.

02:37.525 --> 02:39.793
The church is
being renovated.

02:39.827 --> 02:41.595
Bought the killer time
before he sent the photo.

02:41.629 --> 02:42.463
(phone chimes)

02:42.496 --> 02:46.700
Raven just got
a notification from VICAP.

02:46.734 --> 02:49.237
He was reported missing
a week ago.
MUNDO: Killer must have

02:49.270 --> 02:50.671
hijacked his PicThread account.

02:50.704 --> 02:53.607
Why wait to post this picture
till this morning?

02:53.641 --> 02:54.942
And why post it at all?

02:55.976 --> 02:57.311
This is a mess.
There's blood

02:57.345 --> 02:58.712
and bodily fluids
on the ports,

02:58.746 --> 03:00.881
soaked all the way
through to the keyboard.

03:00.914 --> 03:02.950
I'm gonna take everything
back to CTOC,

03:02.983 --> 03:05.519
see if I can retrieve some data.

03:05.553 --> 03:07.488
RUSSELL:
Okey-dokey. (grunts)

03:07.521 --> 03:08.489
Upsy-daisy.

03:08.522 --> 03:10.524
(others groaning)
Oh, snap.

03:10.558 --> 03:13.661
Well, first things first.

03:19.667 --> 03:23.504
The guy's tongue
has been cut out.

03:23.537 --> 03:25.673
Choked to death
on his own blood.

03:27.808 --> 03:30.010
Is that a tattoo?

03:30.043 --> 03:33.647
RUSSELL:
Yeah, it's a... QR code.

03:33.681 --> 03:36.584
Could be a clue
from our killer.

03:40.521 --> 03:43.624
(slow techno music playing)

03:44.992 --> 03:47.595
* Way from me...

03:50.864 --> 03:53.301
* Way from me...

03:56.437 --> 03:58.872
* Way from me...

04:00.941 --> 04:03.577
* Way from me...

04:06.314 --> 04:09.283
* Way from me...

04:11.852 --> 04:14.655
* Way from me...

04:17.925 --> 04:19.293
* Way...

04:19.327 --> 04:20.394
(music ends)

04:20.428 --> 04:21.929
(voice breaking):
He was a good man.

04:21.962 --> 04:23.631
A good father.

04:23.664 --> 04:25.299
A good husband.

04:25.333 --> 04:27.401
Please keep us in your prayers.

04:27.435 --> 04:28.902
Whoever did this

04:28.936 --> 04:31.505
will have to stand before God

04:31.539 --> 04:32.906
and be judged.

04:32.940 --> 04:34.675
RUSSELL:
I can't imagine

04:34.708 --> 04:37.044
losing a loved one
and then finding out about it

04:37.077 --> 04:38.846
on social media
MUNDO:
PicThread removed the photo,

04:38.879 --> 04:41.882
but it's already gone viral--
it's all over the Internet.

04:41.915 --> 04:43.484
Will be forever.

04:43.517 --> 04:44.618
Raven, were you able
to establish how

04:44.652 --> 04:48.456
that photo was sent
to every user?
Well, it's weird.

04:48.489 --> 04:51.559
Everyone-- and I mean
every PicThread subscriber--

04:51.592 --> 04:53.761
was following Pastor Harrison.

04:53.794 --> 04:56.330
RUSSELL:
I know preaching online

04:56.364 --> 04:58.499
is like the pulpit
of the 21st century,

04:58.532 --> 05:00.634
but that's insane--
that many followers?

05:00.668 --> 05:01.635
MUNDO: Yeah, some
of the most popular

05:01.669 --> 05:03.637
televangelists have only
four or five million.

05:03.671 --> 05:05.906
RAMIREZ:
Pastor Harrison's been using
social media for years.

05:05.939 --> 05:08.742
And last week he had
80,000 followers

05:08.776 --> 05:11.078
on PicThread, but today...

05:11.111 --> 05:15.115
he has just over
200 million followers.

05:15.148 --> 05:17.718
How is that possible?
I don't know yet.

05:17.751 --> 05:19.387
It's got to be a hack.
Wait, look at this.

05:19.420 --> 05:21.088
(rapidly keyboarding)
He recently started posting

05:21.121 --> 05:24.692
about overturning laws
on gay marriage

05:24.725 --> 05:26.560
and protesting abortion clinics.

05:26.594 --> 05:27.761
So, that's interesting, right?

05:27.795 --> 05:29.897
If you take a strong stance
against politicized topics,

05:29.930 --> 05:32.800
it makes a bigger
splash online.

05:32.833 --> 05:35.135
Recruit a hell of a lot
more followers that way.

05:35.168 --> 05:37.738
Yeah, but a controversial post
can make people angry.

05:37.771 --> 05:39.773
MUNDO:
Maybe even get you killed.

05:42.676 --> 05:44.077
(typing)

05:46.814 --> 05:48.682
What'd you find, Nelson?
Normal QR code.

05:48.716 --> 05:50.718
Like the ones in all
the magazine ads-- only this one

05:50.751 --> 05:52.620
is linked to a Web site
with a Swedish domain.

05:52.653 --> 05:54.121
Check this out.

05:54.154 --> 05:55.623
Now...

05:55.656 --> 05:57.124
when I scan the QR code

05:57.157 --> 05:58.759
that we found
on Pastor Harrison,

05:58.792 --> 06:00.494
the image sensor on my phone

06:00.528 --> 06:02.763
reads the data--
in this case, a Web address.

06:02.796 --> 06:04.998
RYAN: So what's on the Web site
that that links to?

06:05.032 --> 06:06.567
I have no idea.
I just know the address.

06:06.600 --> 06:07.835
Well, maybe it's
a phishing site

06:07.868 --> 06:10.438
or maybe it dumps malware
onto the network.
Yeah, but see,

06:10.471 --> 06:12.640
I'm thinking of setting up
a isolated connection

06:12.673 --> 06:14.842
to scan the QR code, then we
can see what's on the site.

06:14.875 --> 06:16.744
This phone will be
the only device

06:16.777 --> 06:18.045
that's exposed.

06:18.078 --> 06:19.680
Do it.
A'ight.

06:19.713 --> 06:21.782
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout.

06:21.815 --> 06:24.852
*

06:36.964 --> 06:39.933
Okay, so the only print
I could get off the laptop

06:39.967 --> 06:41.802
belonged to Pastor Harrison.

06:41.835 --> 06:43.904
Well, and before it was covered
in bloody guts and goo,

06:43.937 --> 06:45.706
this was a brand-new laptop.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.775
There's only one
user-generated file in
the entire hard drive.

06:47.808 --> 06:50.611
RUSSELL:
"If you can't say anything nice,

06:50.644 --> 06:52.713
don't say anything at all."

06:52.746 --> 06:54.748
And this wasn't
copied and pasted-- look.

06:54.782 --> 06:55.749
There's typos

06:55.783 --> 06:56.750
in some of the lines--

06:56.784 --> 06:57.451
gets worse as it goes.

06:57.485 --> 06:59.487
When was this document created?

06:59.520 --> 07:01.154
Time stamp says...

07:01.188 --> 07:03.724
three days ago.
So that was after

07:03.757 --> 07:06.527
Pastor Harrison
was reported missing.

07:06.560 --> 07:08.462
So he was taped to the chair

07:08.496 --> 07:12.633
and forced to type this
over and over again.

07:12.666 --> 07:14.802
There's 10,000
lines here.

07:14.835 --> 07:16.604
Even typing 60 words a minute,

07:16.637 --> 07:19.106
that'd take... days.

07:19.139 --> 07:20.307
Someone wanted
to teach him a lesson.

07:20.340 --> 07:24.878
(overlapping conversations,
phones ringing and beeping)

07:24.912 --> 07:26.847
Oh, really? I don't know.

07:26.880 --> 07:29.650
All right,
let's find Avery.

07:29.683 --> 07:30.651
MAN:
I don't know.

07:32.753 --> 07:34.755
Whoa, have you
seen this?
I don't know. How...

07:34.788 --> 07:35.956
Whoa.

07:35.989 --> 07:38.225
This can't be a coincidence.

07:38.258 --> 07:41.529
We just got another photo.
Yeah, I saw.

07:41.562 --> 07:44.498
Another staged murder sent
to everyone on PicThread?

07:44.532 --> 07:46.500
As soon as
we scanned the QR code

07:46.534 --> 07:48.802
and linked to the site,
this message appeared.

07:48.836 --> 07:52.005
RUSSELL: "Some things are better
kept behind closed doors."

07:52.039 --> 07:53.741
Then everyone's
phone went off

07:53.774 --> 07:54.975
with the new
PicThread alert.

07:55.008 --> 07:58.245
So something we did
triggered the release?

07:58.278 --> 08:01.682
So we're looking at one,
maybe two more victims here.

08:01.715 --> 08:02.916
KRUMITZ: Hashtag
#Graphic Warning.

08:02.950 --> 08:04.251
Same as the other photo.

08:04.284 --> 08:05.886
So our target wants us to know

08:05.919 --> 08:07.921
this is connected
to the last killing.

08:07.955 --> 08:09.923
(scoffs)
This is like the Zodiac Killer

08:09.957 --> 08:11.925
sending letters to the press.

08:11.959 --> 08:14.595
RYAN:
We've got a serial killer
who's taunting us

08:14.628 --> 08:15.829
on social media.

08:20.868 --> 08:27.007
* I know you've deceived me,
now here's a surprise *

08:28.942 --> 08:35.282
* I know that you have, 'cause
there's magic in my eyes *

08:35.315 --> 08:38.819
* I can see
for miles and miles *

08:38.852 --> 08:42.856
* I can see for miles
and miles *

08:42.890 --> 08:46.927
* I can see
for miles and miles *

08:46.960 --> 08:50.698
* And miles...

08:50.731 --> 08:51.732
* Oh, yeah.

09:07.915 --> 09:09.617
My phone has been
ringing off the hook

09:09.650 --> 09:11.018
about photos
on PicThread.

09:11.051 --> 09:12.620
The president's own children
received them.

09:12.653 --> 09:14.688
He called me himself
for answers.

09:14.722 --> 09:16.657
I'm hoping you have some.

09:16.690 --> 09:18.091
Both photos were geo-tagged.

09:18.125 --> 09:20.127
Local law enforcement
are on their way

09:20.160 --> 09:21.228
to the second location.

09:21.261 --> 09:22.896
We're not far behind.
And I understand

09:22.930 --> 09:25.198
our Cyber Division
is responsible

09:25.232 --> 09:27.267
for the second photo
being released?
When that page loaded

09:27.300 --> 09:30.671
here at CTOC, it ran a script
that automatically posted

09:30.704 --> 09:32.773
the next photo to PicThread.

09:32.806 --> 09:36.276
The target wanted the FBI to be
responsible for sending it out.

09:36.309 --> 09:38.345
I promise you, this
will not happen again.

09:38.378 --> 09:39.379
Good.

09:39.412 --> 09:41.381
(indistinct chatter)

09:41.414 --> 09:43.617
(elevator bell dings)

09:44.652 --> 09:45.919
*

09:48.188 --> 09:49.757
Aw, come on,
you can't spare

09:49.790 --> 09:51.358
an hour for your old man?

09:51.391 --> 09:53.226
Dad, I'm so sorry. I...

09:53.260 --> 09:54.361
You have to cancel
our lunch.

09:54.394 --> 09:56.630
This case just
came in. It's...

09:56.664 --> 09:57.497
I understand.

09:57.530 --> 10:00.100
But, uh... can we
talk for a minute?

10:01.134 --> 10:02.402
It's important.

10:02.435 --> 10:03.403
Yeah. Yeah.

10:03.436 --> 10:05.806
Um... come on.

10:11.044 --> 10:12.713
You okay?

10:13.881 --> 10:14.848
Still have cancer.

10:14.882 --> 10:16.183
Chemo sucks.

10:16.216 --> 10:17.617
Otherwise, I'm fine.

10:19.753 --> 10:21.288
It's about you and Devon.

10:21.321 --> 10:23.123
The other day, when
I was with Michelle,

10:23.156 --> 10:24.792
she said...

10:24.825 --> 10:26.927
"Mommy and Daddy
have been fighting."

10:26.960 --> 10:28.929
It's nothing for you to be...

10:28.962 --> 10:30.330
Who's Nina?

10:31.699 --> 10:33.166
Michelle mentioned her.

10:34.334 --> 10:38.138
Nina is a bartender
at Conaghan's Pub.

10:38.171 --> 10:40.007
Why? What did Michelle say
about Nina?

10:40.040 --> 10:42.342
She heard her name

10:42.375 --> 10:43.977
when you were fighting.

10:46.379 --> 10:48.415
Are you having an affair?

10:49.449 --> 10:51.384
Dad...
You can be honest

10:51.418 --> 10:52.853
with me, son.
Come on.

10:52.886 --> 10:55.188
No.

10:55.222 --> 10:58.191
I'm trying
to make it work with Devon.

10:58.225 --> 11:01.228
A few months ago,
I-I went to Conaghan's Pub

11:01.261 --> 11:04.732
a couple times. Nina was
working there. We chatted.

11:04.765 --> 11:06.734
Next thing I know,
she's become friends with Devon,

11:06.767 --> 11:08.401
she's trying to come between us.

11:08.435 --> 11:10.103
Oh, hey.
Hey.

11:10.137 --> 11:13.106
Perfect timing. We were just
about to sit down for dinner.

11:13.140 --> 11:15.976
This is my friend Nina,
from spin class.

11:16.009 --> 11:17.477
She's gonna join us.

11:17.510 --> 11:18.345
NINA:
Devon, this is so crazy.

11:18.378 --> 11:20.981
Elijah and I actually
know each other.

11:21.014 --> 11:22.883
He comes to my bar
all the time.

11:22.916 --> 11:25.819
You see what's going on here?
You see what she started?
Elijah,

11:25.853 --> 11:27.788
is there something more
you want to tell me?

11:27.821 --> 11:30.457
The woman is delusional.
And then, out of nowhere,

11:30.490 --> 11:32.760
the other night, she texted me.

11:32.793 --> 11:34.795
Devon saw the text

11:34.828 --> 11:38.131
come through.
You know, it was a thing.

11:38.165 --> 11:40.801
But it's fine. We're fine.

11:40.834 --> 11:42.803
Hmm.

11:42.836 --> 11:44.504
You sure?

11:44.537 --> 11:45.939
Yeah.

11:47.808 --> 11:48.776
Don't worry about it.

11:49.476 --> 11:51.311
Dinner this weekend?

11:51.344 --> 11:52.813
Why not tonight?

11:52.846 --> 11:54.915
Flying to Boston.

11:54.948 --> 11:56.950
*

12:03.123 --> 12:05.759
MUNDO: Nicole Hogan,
24 years old,

12:05.793 --> 12:07.394
third-year
graduate student.

12:07.427 --> 12:09.763
This is her place.
Photo was posted to her account.

12:09.797 --> 12:10.998
Greg Roberts, 25.

12:11.031 --> 12:12.833
He lives across town.

12:12.866 --> 12:15.102
No PicThread account that we
could find. Initial body temp

12:15.135 --> 12:16.904
suggests they haven't
been dead long.

12:16.937 --> 12:18.505
Nine, ten hours at the most.

12:18.538 --> 12:22.042
No rigor.

12:22.075 --> 12:24.878
And look at this.
He's-he's clenching

12:24.912 --> 12:26.947
the selfie stick.

12:26.980 --> 12:29.516
So maybe a cadaveric spasm.

12:31.251 --> 12:33.921
No, I'm wrong.

12:36.890 --> 12:39.259
It's glued to his hand.

12:39.292 --> 12:40.894
MUNDO:
The killer was kind enough

12:40.928 --> 12:43.263
to leave us the camera.

12:43.296 --> 12:45.799
RUSSELL:
Blood pool left a void,

12:45.833 --> 12:49.036
suggesting that Nicole
was shot first at...

12:49.069 --> 12:50.303
point-blank range.

12:54.507 --> 12:56.810
RYAN: The shooter
needed the picture,

12:56.844 --> 12:58.879
so Greg was held at gunpoint.

12:58.912 --> 13:02.015
He dragged Nicole towards him,

13:02.049 --> 13:04.017
was forced to take

13:04.051 --> 13:05.886
a selfie.

13:05.919 --> 13:09.890
And Greg was shot
in the head.

13:09.923 --> 13:12.559
Splattered all over the wall.

13:12.592 --> 13:14.127
MUNDO: Someone went through
an awful lot of trouble

13:14.161 --> 13:16.296
to stage a photo
to post on PicThread.

13:16.329 --> 13:17.297
RUSSELL:
For the second time,

13:17.330 --> 13:18.899
right?

13:18.932 --> 13:21.168
Pastor Harrison's murder
was staged also.

13:21.201 --> 13:23.003
RYAN: Yeah, that's
what I don't get.

13:23.036 --> 13:25.572
How are these victims
related to Pastor Harrison?

13:25.605 --> 13:27.841
How are they connected?

13:28.876 --> 13:31.544
RUSSELL:
Okay.

13:31.578 --> 13:34.214
Got another QR code.

13:34.247 --> 13:35.883
MUNDO:
There's your connection.

13:35.916 --> 13:38.018
And maybe another victim.

13:42.589 --> 13:44.591
(crying)
(pipe organ playing)

13:54.601 --> 13:57.104
I'm so sorry
for your loss.

13:57.137 --> 13:58.605
Thank you.

13:58.638 --> 14:00.140
(crying)

14:44.952 --> 14:45.953
(tapping keys)

14:57.965 --> 14:59.232
KRUMITZ:
I did it.

14:59.266 --> 15:01.068
I discovered how the photos
were blasted out

15:01.101 --> 15:03.403
to over 200 million
PicThread users.

15:03.436 --> 15:06.206
I found what's called
a force-follow bug attached

15:06.239 --> 15:07.707
to Aiden Harrison's profile.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.943
It's extra code
that forces anyone

15:09.977 --> 15:12.946
that visits the pastor's page
to follow him automatically.

15:12.980 --> 15:15.482
Then that code gets
copied to their profiles

15:15.515 --> 15:18.118
and spreads to their followers
and so on and so forth.

15:18.151 --> 15:20.553
It's like what happened with
MySpace all those years ago.

15:20.587 --> 15:23.957
They had to shut down the site
to stop the bug from spreading.

15:23.991 --> 15:26.093
This exploit is
much more complex

15:26.126 --> 15:28.996
and grows way faster.

15:29.029 --> 15:31.664
RUSSELL: So the more
Pastor Harrison posted,

15:31.698 --> 15:33.666
the faster this
exploit spread.

15:33.700 --> 15:35.735
KRUMITZ: Within 48 hours,
Aiden Harrison

15:35.768 --> 15:39.039
was being followed
by everyone on PicThread.

15:39.072 --> 15:41.308
And Nicole's profile
has the same code?

15:41.341 --> 15:43.977
Yeah.
So can we search
for this bug on another

15:44.011 --> 15:46.113
PicThread account?
Could lead us to our

15:46.146 --> 15:47.414
next potential
victim.

15:47.447 --> 15:48.415
We'd have to comb through

15:48.448 --> 15:50.017
every account individually.

15:50.050 --> 15:52.619
With over 200 million users,
I mean, that'd take...

15:52.652 --> 15:54.021
Too long.

15:54.054 --> 15:55.522
So the QR code
on Nicole's body

15:55.555 --> 15:58.125
may be the only way
to find our next victim.

15:58.158 --> 16:00.060
Dead or alive.

16:00.093 --> 16:03.330
Nicole's QR code leads
to another Swedish site.

16:03.363 --> 16:05.532
And we can't view the page
unless we link to it.

16:05.565 --> 16:07.600
RYAN: Eh, we can't. Could send
out another gruesome photo

16:07.634 --> 16:09.536
to every
PicThread user.

16:09.569 --> 16:11.471
Yeah, well, I contacted
the Swedish hosting company,

16:11.504 --> 16:13.340
but they're not
the most cooperative.

16:13.373 --> 16:15.342
Kind of a...
Internet free speech

16:15.375 --> 16:17.177
haven over there.
I'll call in

16:17.210 --> 16:19.079
a favor and see
if I can get behind the site.

16:19.112 --> 16:22.049
Raven, were you able to
find a connection between

16:22.082 --> 16:23.616
Pastor Harrison and

16:23.650 --> 16:25.685
Greg Roberts or Nicole Hogan?

16:25.718 --> 16:27.187
Nothing we didn't already know.

16:27.220 --> 16:29.089
Nicole Hogan and Pastor Harrison

16:29.122 --> 16:30.357
are both on PicThread.

16:30.390 --> 16:31.724
And Greg is on FriendAgenda

16:31.758 --> 16:33.760
but barely ever posts.

16:33.793 --> 16:35.462
What about e-mail or texts?

16:35.495 --> 16:37.064
Nothing with
Pastor Harrison

16:37.097 --> 16:39.266
but I did find texts
with Greg and Nicole.

16:39.299 --> 16:40.733
They met
a few weeks ago,

16:40.767 --> 16:42.469
and things started
to get flirty fast.

16:42.502 --> 16:44.371
Nicole sent
naked photos

16:44.404 --> 16:45.805
of herself.

16:45.838 --> 16:47.140
Some of these photos were found

16:47.174 --> 16:49.142
on Nicole's phone
at the crime scene.

16:49.176 --> 16:51.078
Along with other photos
of Nicole

16:51.111 --> 16:52.545
in bed
with various men.

16:52.579 --> 16:55.482
RYAN: Like the photo the killer
posted of Greg and Nicole.

16:55.515 --> 16:57.284
Yeah, they're called
sex selfies.

16:57.317 --> 16:58.751
Yeah, it's a thing.
You know,

16:58.785 --> 17:01.288
people take photos
during or after sex and...

17:01.321 --> 17:04.524
just post 'em up on PicThread.
(chuckles)

17:05.658 --> 17:07.794
N-No, I read... I read about it.

17:07.827 --> 17:11.798
Online exhibitionism.
Whether for amusement or

17:11.831 --> 17:14.734
sexual satisfaction, a lot of
people like playing porn star.

17:14.767 --> 17:17.404
But if Nicole posted
these photos on PicThread,

17:17.437 --> 17:18.605
they would've been removed
immediately.

17:18.638 --> 17:22.475
Most social media sites have
very strict no nudity policies.

17:22.509 --> 17:24.844
That's it, Raven.
That's the connection.

17:24.877 --> 17:26.079
PicThread's content

17:26.113 --> 17:27.814
abuse policy.

17:27.847 --> 17:30.217
Nelson, can you pull up
the messages

17:30.250 --> 17:31.618
the killer left us?
Mm-hmm.

17:31.651 --> 17:33.853
(rapid keyboarding)

17:33.886 --> 17:35.388
RYAN: "If you can't
say anything nice,

17:35.422 --> 17:36.823
don't say anything at all."

17:36.856 --> 17:39.092
Pastor Harrison
was being punished

17:39.126 --> 17:41.161
for saying something
that offended the target.

17:41.194 --> 17:43.830
And Nicole Hogan was punished
for posting sex selfies.

17:43.863 --> 17:45.698
RAMIREZ: "Some things
are better kept

17:45.732 --> 17:47.534
behind closed doors."
RYAN: Okay. Hate speech

17:47.567 --> 17:50.103
and porn.
These are two of the five

17:50.137 --> 17:51.504
main categories

17:51.538 --> 17:53.173
of abuse on social media.

17:53.206 --> 17:56.243
The FBI helped create the list
used by social media sites.

17:56.276 --> 17:59.746
Hate speech, porn, violence,
drugs, and trolling.

17:59.779 --> 18:01.881
Or as our killer
would call them, the Five

18:01.914 --> 18:03.116
Deadly Sins of
Social Media.

18:17.164 --> 18:19.332
RYAN: We're looking at
a vigilante serial killer

18:19.366 --> 18:20.500
in the Boston area,

18:20.533 --> 18:22.502
who's targeting
PicThread users

18:22.535 --> 18:23.570
who are violating
the content abuse policy.

18:23.603 --> 18:25.305
The hashtag,
#GraphicWarning,

18:25.338 --> 18:27.774
is trending. Message board
full of people talking

18:27.807 --> 18:28.841
about the two photos.

18:28.875 --> 18:31.178
RYAN: The target's getting
what he wants, exposure.

18:31.211 --> 18:33.513
Which means we could be looking
at three more killings.

18:33.546 --> 18:35.448
Well, hate speech
and porn are covered.

18:35.482 --> 18:38.551
That leaves violence,
drugs, and trolling.

18:38.585 --> 18:40.353
We have to figure out what's
next. We have to get ahead

18:40.387 --> 18:42.655
of this before he kills again.
'Cause when he completes

18:42.689 --> 18:43.723
these five categories,

18:43.756 --> 18:45.892
our target
could disappear forever.

18:45.925 --> 18:48.628
Well, according
to the PicThread activity log,

18:48.661 --> 18:51.631
Pastor Harrison has had posts
removed for hate content,

18:51.664 --> 18:54.567
and Nicole Hogan had posts
removed for violating

18:54.601 --> 18:56.736
their sex and nudity clause.

18:56.769 --> 18:58.471
RUSSELL:
So we're looking for

18:58.505 --> 19:00.273
PicThread users
that have had posts removed

19:00.307 --> 19:02.942
for-for violence, drugs,
and trolling.

19:02.975 --> 19:04.277
One of them

19:04.311 --> 19:05.077
is our next victim.

19:05.111 --> 19:06.646
Yeah, but if the posts
are removed,

19:06.679 --> 19:08.548
how does the target know
they existed?

19:08.581 --> 19:09.416
NELSON:
He could have a back door

19:09.449 --> 19:11.451
into PicThread's system.
Removed files

19:11.484 --> 19:12.585
remain on their servers.
Wait, wait.

19:12.619 --> 19:14.587
Our target
wouldn't have to intrude

19:14.621 --> 19:17.524
into PicThread's system
if he worked there.

19:18.425 --> 19:21.461
*

19:40.313 --> 19:44.584
Worldwide, we employ
around 600 content moderators.

19:44.617 --> 19:45.885
80 in this office.

19:45.918 --> 19:48.221
30 or so working
any given shift,

19:48.255 --> 19:50.390
monitoring the site 24/7.

19:50.423 --> 19:52.259
And their only job
is to remove posts

19:52.292 --> 19:54.327
that violate PicThread's
abuse standards?

19:54.361 --> 19:58.465
An algorithm flags potential
infractions: decapitations,

19:58.498 --> 19:59.932
animal torture,
sexual solicitation.

19:59.966 --> 20:01.734
The posts flagged

20:01.768 --> 20:04.404
by the algorithm are then sent
here for our moderators

20:04.437 --> 20:06.773
to either ignore or remove.

20:06.806 --> 20:08.575
RYAN:
200 million users.

20:08.608 --> 20:11.611
Seems like a big job.
It's a tough job.

20:11.644 --> 20:13.880
Social media should be
a safe place for everyone.

20:13.913 --> 20:16.749
Nobody should have to see
what comes across these screens.

20:17.750 --> 20:20.920
Like this photo, for example.

20:20.953 --> 20:23.956
Who would post
such a thing?

20:23.990 --> 20:26.759
This photo violates
our no trolling policy.

20:26.793 --> 20:28.595
KRUMITZ:
I'm gonna get down to I.T.,

20:28.628 --> 20:30.597
see if I can get a list
of employee devices.

20:30.630 --> 20:33.933
Do your employees undergo
psychometric testing

20:33.966 --> 20:37.437
to evaluate their mental health
before they're hired?
Yes.

20:37.470 --> 20:39.038
We have a mandatory review
of each employee

20:39.071 --> 20:40.440
on a monthly basis.

20:40.473 --> 20:41.974
We have
our own counselor on call.

20:42.008 --> 20:42.975
Even with the best counseling,

20:43.009 --> 20:45.645
looking at profoundly disturbing
images all day

20:45.678 --> 20:47.480
is bound to take its toll.

20:47.514 --> 20:50.817
I'd like to see those
evaluations of your employees,

20:50.850 --> 20:52.352
past and present.

20:52.385 --> 20:53.286
Of course.

20:53.320 --> 20:55.455
*

20:55.488 --> 20:57.724
WOMAN:
I've been having nightmares.

20:57.757 --> 21:00.727
Bolting awake
in the middle of the night.

21:00.760 --> 21:03.830
But I need this job
to pay for my tuition.

21:05.865 --> 21:07.734
MAN (echoing): What's
the worst thing I've ever seen?

21:09.669 --> 21:10.670
It's hard to pick just one.

21:10.703 --> 21:13.440
I mean...

21:13.473 --> 21:14.674
beheading videos
are never easy.

21:14.707 --> 21:15.842
WOMAN (echoing):
Angry?

21:15.875 --> 21:17.777
Why would I seem angry?

21:17.810 --> 21:19.779
Maybe because I'm starving,
but I can't eat

21:19.812 --> 21:22.014
because this job makes me
sick to my stomach.

21:22.048 --> 21:25.652
You know what?
Forget this place. I quit.

21:25.685 --> 21:27.654
MAN 2:
Do I like this job?

21:27.687 --> 21:29.489
I don't know.

21:29.522 --> 21:32.058
Does anybody ever really
like their job?

21:32.091 --> 21:34.093
I guess I do.

21:34.126 --> 21:37.630
Hours are good,
pay is decent.

21:37.664 --> 21:39.732
I only live a few miles away.

21:39.766 --> 21:41.834
(echoing):
It's a job.

21:51.878 --> 21:53.646
These are all the flagged posts
from the Boston area

21:53.680 --> 21:55.815
relating to drugs,
trolling and violence.

21:55.848 --> 21:57.350
And if I'm completely honest,

21:57.384 --> 21:59.652
I still don't understand
what trolling is.

21:59.686 --> 22:02.822
Basically, trolls are jerks.

22:02.855 --> 22:05.358
Most are just annoying,
but some can do real damage.

22:05.392 --> 22:08.695
Bullying kids into
committing suicide,

22:08.728 --> 22:10.863
or blackmailing people
they meet online.

22:10.897 --> 22:15.602
So in a way, they do evoke the
trolls of Scandinavian folklore.

22:15.635 --> 22:18.037
They're antisocial,
they're angry,

22:18.070 --> 22:22.442
dimwitted creatures that make
life difficult for travelers.

22:22.475 --> 22:24.577
Jerks.
Jerks.

22:24.611 --> 22:26.813
Look at that.

22:26.846 --> 22:29.549
There are, like, thousands
of flagged posts. Now, how

22:29.582 --> 22:31.584
are we gonna sort through all
of that to find our next victim?

22:31.618 --> 22:35.388
And these are only
from the last 24 hours.

22:35.422 --> 22:38.691
I can't even imagine having to
review these photos all day,

22:38.725 --> 22:39.692
every day.

22:39.726 --> 22:41.561
Definitely would mess
with your head.
Mm.

22:41.594 --> 22:42.729
Hey D.B.?

22:42.762 --> 22:44.997
Yeah.
Think I got
something here.

22:45.031 --> 22:46.866
Avery got
the Swedish hosting company

22:46.899 --> 22:49.168
to send me the HTML
of the target's site.

22:49.201 --> 22:50.770
Now, it's unregistered,

22:50.803 --> 22:52.539
so the target can stay
anonymous.

22:52.572 --> 22:54.774
But check this out.

22:56.476 --> 22:59.646
Next message
from Nicole's QR code.

22:59.679 --> 23:02.081
RUSSELL: "Your next dose
could be lethal."

23:02.114 --> 23:04.183
Okay, all right,
so the next sin

23:04.216 --> 23:05.785
is drugs.

23:08.187 --> 23:11.791
(siren blaring)

23:11.824 --> 23:13.025
(laughter
and indistinct chatter)

23:13.059 --> 23:15.027
* Your skin shivers

23:15.061 --> 23:18.998
* Your lips quiver...

23:19.031 --> 23:20.867
How you doing over here?
You need another one?

23:20.900 --> 23:23.069
No.

23:23.102 --> 23:25.938
I need you to stay away
from my son and his family.

23:25.972 --> 23:27.774
I'm sorry?

23:27.807 --> 23:30.209
Elijah and Devon have worked
hard to save their marriage,

23:30.242 --> 23:33.613
and my granddaughter
is the most important thing

23:33.646 --> 23:34.981
in the world to me.

23:36.783 --> 23:37.817
You're Elijah's dad, Cal.

23:37.850 --> 23:39.819
No more phone calls,

23:39.852 --> 23:41.821
no late night texts.

23:41.854 --> 23:43.723
You hear me?

23:43.756 --> 23:45.858
Pretty girl like you,
plenty of options.

23:45.892 --> 23:47.527
(hits hand on bar)

23:47.560 --> 23:49.962
Stay away from my son.

23:50.930 --> 23:52.665
(people gasping)
Oh, my God.

23:52.699 --> 23:54.000
Somebody call 911!

23:54.033 --> 23:56.803
(everyone talking at once)

23:56.836 --> 23:58.605
WOMAN:
Don't move his head.

24:01.007 --> 24:03.943
(techno music playing)

24:03.976 --> 24:05.678
* Do you feel that?

24:05.712 --> 24:07.146
* Can you feel that?

24:07.179 --> 24:08.180
* Uh!

24:11.851 --> 24:13.119
* Do you feel that?

24:13.152 --> 24:14.787
* Can you feel that?

24:17.189 --> 24:19.125
Jared Atchley,

24:19.158 --> 24:21.260
Agent Ryan, FBI.
I'm here investigating

24:21.293 --> 24:23.229
the two images that
were posted yesterday.

24:23.262 --> 24:25.698
Do you know which pictures
I'm talking about?

24:25.732 --> 24:26.833
The dead bodies?

24:26.866 --> 24:28.601
(wry laugh)

24:28.635 --> 24:29.936
You're not asking me
if they're real.

24:29.969 --> 24:32.972
You learn to tell
the difference after a while.

24:33.005 --> 24:35.141
I see you've worked
here for two years.

24:35.174 --> 24:36.976
That's impressive.
Is it?

24:37.009 --> 24:40.947
Isn't it? Most people hit the
wall after three or four months.

24:40.980 --> 24:43.215
I play a lot of chess.

24:43.249 --> 24:46.052
Does looking at these images
make you feel...

24:46.085 --> 24:49.856
anxiety, depressed...?

24:49.889 --> 24:51.524
Not anymore.

24:51.558 --> 24:52.825
This changes you.

24:52.859 --> 24:53.993
The photos?

24:54.026 --> 24:54.961
Seeing proof

24:54.994 --> 24:57.930
of the infinite variety
of human depravity.

24:57.964 --> 24:59.666
Wondering what secrets

24:59.699 --> 25:01.968
my neighbors are hiding
on their hard drives.

25:02.001 --> 25:03.536
This job won't kill you,

25:03.570 --> 25:06.839
but it'll give you
a much darker view of humanity.

25:09.175 --> 25:11.544
NELSON:
Killer's site was created
by someone at PicThread.

25:11.578 --> 25:12.979
Just find the device
in the building

25:13.012 --> 25:14.614
that uploaded the files,
and boom,

25:14.647 --> 25:16.649
we know who the target is.

25:16.683 --> 25:17.950
I'm telling you,
I'm on the network

25:17.984 --> 25:19.118
staring at the Mac address

25:19.151 --> 25:21.153
of the device
that uploaded the files.

25:21.187 --> 25:23.122
All right,
then what's the problem?

25:23.155 --> 25:25.257
It's not on the list of
devices assigned to employees.

25:25.291 --> 25:27.226
All right, so the target
has spoofed his Mac address

25:27.259 --> 25:28.928
to stay hidden. All right.

25:28.961 --> 25:29.762
Look, man, you may have to check

25:29.796 --> 25:31.664
every device
in the building by hand.

25:31.698 --> 25:33.332
I know his device
is here somewhere.

25:33.365 --> 25:34.967
I just can't see it.

25:35.001 --> 25:37.937
Hold up. All right,
you can't see it,

25:37.970 --> 25:39.606
but could you hear it?

25:42.041 --> 25:43.142
Says in your file

25:43.175 --> 25:46.178
that last year, you were
arrested for domestic violence.

25:47.847 --> 25:51.083
They consider roommates to be
in a domestic relationship.

25:51.117 --> 25:53.185
And you remember that fondly?

25:53.219 --> 25:55.588
No. I'm on probation

25:55.622 --> 25:57.123
because my roommate
threw the first punch,

25:57.156 --> 25:59.826
but he's the one
that ended up in the hospital.

25:59.859 --> 26:00.927
Avery...

26:00.960 --> 26:02.194
Excuse me.

26:04.096 --> 26:06.265
We may have a way to figure
out who we're looking for.

26:06.298 --> 26:08.100
What did you find, Daniel?

26:08.134 --> 26:10.302
The device that the target
used is somewhere here,

26:10.336 --> 26:13.372
and I can't track it, but
I can communicate with it.

26:13.405 --> 26:16.342
I can send it an audio
file and then a script

26:16.375 --> 26:18.077
play automatically
through the speakers.

26:18.110 --> 26:21.080
Like a phone ringing.
Yeah.

26:21.113 --> 26:23.115
Oh. Did you send the file yet?

26:23.149 --> 26:25.818
No, I need your authorization.
You have it.

26:25.852 --> 26:26.953
Daniel, do it, go.
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

26:26.986 --> 26:28.788
Here we go.

26:29.822 --> 26:33.392
(phone ringing)

26:33.425 --> 26:34.761
Wait. Wait.
That's not it.

26:34.794 --> 26:36.062
(phone ringing in distance)

26:36.095 --> 26:37.830
Okay, it's this way. Come on.

26:37.864 --> 26:39.732
(phone ringing in distance)

26:42.101 --> 26:43.770
(phone continues ringing)

26:46.038 --> 26:47.740
This is it.

26:47.774 --> 26:50.176
This is where the target
uploaded the files from.

26:51.310 --> 26:52.745
Okay.

26:52.779 --> 26:53.813
Here we go.

26:56.683 --> 26:58.785
The target was definitely
using this computer.

26:58.818 --> 27:01.087
Now let's just see which of
the employees logs in from here.

27:04.456 --> 27:05.491
RYAN: Sasha Boyd.

27:05.524 --> 27:08.427
Social media should be
a safe place for everyone.

27:08.460 --> 27:11.030
Nobody should have to see
what comes across these screens.

27:11.063 --> 27:12.064
Call Security.
Sasha Boyd is our target.

27:18.470 --> 27:20.973
RUSSELL: Okay, we know
Sasha Boyd's our target.

27:21.007 --> 27:22.108
What's her next move?

27:22.141 --> 27:25.011
You see the Web address
within the HTML?

27:25.044 --> 27:27.413
That's the next photo
Sasha embedded into the site,

27:27.446 --> 27:29.415
so the next victim, having
something to do with the drugs,

27:29.448 --> 27:31.050
will be in that photo.

27:31.083 --> 27:32.685
Okay, so can we view the photo

27:32.719 --> 27:34.353
without triggering the
site to send it to every

27:34.386 --> 27:36.355
PicThread user?
No.

27:36.388 --> 27:38.124
Well, then what are you
so excited about?
Well, because

27:38.157 --> 27:40.392
the photo is geo-tagged,
just like the others.

27:40.426 --> 27:44.230
I can pull the metadata off
the photo without viewing it...

27:44.263 --> 27:46.799
And get the location
of our next victim

27:46.833 --> 27:48.267
without Sasha knowing.

27:48.300 --> 27:49.435
Bam.

27:49.468 --> 27:51.437
Our next location.

27:51.470 --> 27:54.673
RUSSELL: Let's do it, then
get the coordinates to Elijah.

27:58.745 --> 28:01.781
(sirens blaring)

28:05.852 --> 28:07.820
(knocking loudly)

28:07.854 --> 28:09.856
AGENT:
FBI! Open up!

28:21.100 --> 28:23.502
We got a pulse.
Get the EMTs in here!

28:23.535 --> 28:25.838
AGENT:
Clear.

28:25.872 --> 28:27.406
AGENT 2:
Landing clear!

28:27.439 --> 28:29.041
AGENT 3:
This room's clear!

28:32.879 --> 28:37.083
Ryan Kilmer, 32-year-old
photographer and heroin addict.

28:37.116 --> 28:38.785
Ryan was given a hot-shot--

28:38.818 --> 28:39.886
a lethal dose of heroin,

28:39.919 --> 28:41.854
left to overdose about an hour
before we got here.

28:41.888 --> 28:42.922
How's he holding up?

28:42.955 --> 28:44.123
Uh, it was close,

28:44.156 --> 28:46.325
but looks like
he's gonna make it.
Good.

28:46.358 --> 28:49.028
Sasha's like, what,
an hour ahead of us?

28:49.061 --> 28:51.097
We'll keep you posted, Elijah.

28:51.130 --> 28:54.033
All right, Ryan was part
of an online trend

28:54.066 --> 28:55.835
known as the Junkies
of PicThread.

28:55.868 --> 28:58.437
Users post photos
glamorizing their drug use.

28:58.470 --> 29:00.506
RYAN: Sasha wanted
to teach him a lesson,

29:00.539 --> 29:03.542
just like she did with Pastor
Harrison and Nicole Hogan.

29:03.575 --> 29:06.312
She wanted to make examples
of them on social media.

29:06.345 --> 29:08.915
Linking them all together with
the hashtag "Graphic Warning."

29:08.948 --> 29:11.918
I still can't believe
that Sasha's the target.

29:11.951 --> 29:13.252
She seemed so normal, right?

29:13.285 --> 29:15.487
Well, she must be
extremely damaged

29:15.521 --> 29:17.489
from her time
as a content moderator.

29:17.523 --> 29:19.191
You know,
in jobs like that,

29:19.225 --> 29:21.828
it's not unusual
to have chronic PTSD.

29:21.861 --> 29:23.162
It's similar to what

29:23.195 --> 29:25.031
combat veterans experience.

29:25.064 --> 29:28.000
It's very rare to have
a female serial killer.

29:28.034 --> 29:31.570
They're usually
not this violent.

29:31.603 --> 29:33.272
In her mind, she believes

29:33.305 --> 29:36.075
that she's not doing this
for her own enjoyment.

29:36.108 --> 29:38.310
She's a vigilante.

29:38.344 --> 29:41.180
She really thinks
she's making the Internet safer.

29:41.213 --> 29:42.849
So maybe that's
her Graphic Warning:

29:42.882 --> 29:44.150
post photos like these,

29:44.183 --> 29:45.517
you could be next.

29:45.551 --> 29:48.520
*

29:48.554 --> 29:50.522
(panting)

29:50.556 --> 29:52.291
SASHA: You went to
this boy's funeral

29:52.324 --> 29:54.861
just to snap this photo.

30:01.567 --> 30:03.903
Sometimes I wonder what
you people are thinking

30:03.936 --> 30:05.371
when you post
stuff like this.

30:05.404 --> 30:07.339
I really do.

30:07.373 --> 30:09.241
Wh... What are
you gonna...

30:09.275 --> 30:10.943
what are you
gonna do to me?

30:12.411 --> 30:15.081
I'm teaching you a lesson, Toby.

30:15.114 --> 30:17.950
I'm teaching
everyone a lesson.

30:17.984 --> 30:19.118
What is this?

30:19.151 --> 30:20.853
W-Why are you doing this?

30:20.887 --> 30:21.620
Wha... Ah!

30:21.653 --> 30:23.856
(screams, sobs)

30:25.291 --> 30:26.558
Please...

30:26.592 --> 30:28.895
P-Please...

30:28.928 --> 30:30.863
Please, don't...

30:30.897 --> 30:32.064
(screaming)

30:34.200 --> 30:36.168
(gasping)

30:36.202 --> 30:38.437
(sobbing)

30:38.470 --> 30:39.838
(screams)

30:43.675 --> 30:45.411
Huh?
Oh, you got that?

30:45.444 --> 30:46.879
Oh, no.
I can't believe
this is happening again.

30:46.913 --> 30:48.180
I know!
All right,
it wasn't me this time.

30:49.481 --> 30:51.283
KRUMTIZ: It's a photo of
our junkie, Ryan Kilmer.

30:51.317 --> 30:52.885
Posted to his account.

30:52.919 --> 30:54.053
We didn't scan the QR code,

30:54.086 --> 30:55.387
so Sasha must have posted this.

30:55.421 --> 30:58.024
What stopping her from
just posting the next photo?

30:58.057 --> 30:59.091
Because there isn't one.

31:00.459 --> 31:03.262
I got behind the site
from her last QR code,

31:03.295 --> 31:05.497
and the next message is
"Please Don't Feed the Trolls,"

31:05.531 --> 31:08.000
but... there's no photo.

31:08.034 --> 31:10.970
Sasha's clues
have different themes,

31:11.003 --> 31:12.939
but each one has
a signature photo.

31:12.972 --> 31:14.941
So why doesn't this one
have a photo?

31:17.176 --> 31:18.177
(phone buzzes)

31:18.210 --> 31:20.212
Agent Mundo.

31:20.246 --> 31:22.381
(sirens wailing in distance)

31:22.414 --> 31:24.350
Yes, Cal Mundo is my father.
Why?

31:34.526 --> 31:36.228
Hi.

31:36.262 --> 31:38.364
Nina, what the hell
are you doing here?

31:38.397 --> 31:39.698
Where's Devon?

31:39.731 --> 31:42.001
They said my wife was here.

31:42.034 --> 31:43.402
I had to tell 'em
I was your wife

31:43.435 --> 31:44.670
so they'd let me stay
with your father.

31:44.703 --> 31:46.939
Stay? Wha...

31:46.973 --> 31:49.008
What were you doing with him
in the first place?

31:49.041 --> 31:50.977
I saved
your father's life, Elijah.

31:51.010 --> 31:53.079
He came to see me.

31:53.112 --> 31:54.947
Why?

31:54.981 --> 31:56.182
I don't know.

31:56.215 --> 31:58.117
To talk, maybe?

31:58.150 --> 32:00.586
I'm a pretty good listener.

32:00.619 --> 32:02.588
Well, you used to
think so, anyway.

32:02.621 --> 32:04.123
He said you
told him about me.

32:05.691 --> 32:08.660
He was not very
friendly at first.

32:08.694 --> 32:11.230
But then we started talking...

32:11.263 --> 32:14.266
getting to know each other.

32:14.300 --> 32:16.468
We were actually
having a really nice time.

32:16.502 --> 32:18.537
And then, out of nowhere,
he just collapsed

32:18.570 --> 32:20.672
and I had to give him CPR
until the paramedics came.

32:20.706 --> 32:23.575
They said he might not have
made it had I not done that.

32:26.345 --> 32:29.281
I'm sorry, Elijah.

32:29.315 --> 32:31.984
I know how hard
this must be for you.

32:37.023 --> 32:38.724
Nina, listen to me

32:38.757 --> 32:40.692
very carefully.

32:40.726 --> 32:43.062
I'm having you banned
from this hospital

32:43.095 --> 32:44.997
and then I am filing
a restraining order.

32:45.031 --> 32:47.066
If you call or text

32:47.099 --> 32:50.469
or come within 50 feet
of anyone in my family--

32:50.502 --> 32:52.604
anyone-- you will be arrested.

32:52.638 --> 32:54.640
Do you understand?

32:55.741 --> 32:57.743
I'm an agent with the FBI.

32:59.545 --> 33:01.513
Don't test me.

33:01.547 --> 33:03.582
I'm just trying to help you.

33:03.615 --> 33:05.184
That's all I've ever
wanted to do-- I just...

33:05.217 --> 33:06.752
I don't want your help!

33:06.785 --> 33:09.388
I want you to leave.

33:11.290 --> 33:14.426
Stay out of my life!

33:25.104 --> 33:26.038
(sighs)

33:30.109 --> 33:32.044
Well, we know that Sasha
is in Boston.
RUSSELL: Right.

33:32.078 --> 33:34.713
She's not gonna stop
until her message is complete.

33:34.746 --> 33:37.116
Right, and we know
the next sin is Trolling.

33:37.149 --> 33:40.652
But with no photo, that could
mean there's no victim yet.

33:40.686 --> 33:43.255
Could be staging
her next murder as we speak.

33:43.289 --> 33:46.125
Actually, that could be
how we find her.

33:46.158 --> 33:47.659
Raven, uh,

33:47.693 --> 33:50.229
log onto Sasha's
PicThread account.

33:50.262 --> 33:51.630
Then click onto "followers"

33:51.663 --> 33:53.799
and go to the "people
you may know" section.

33:55.301 --> 33:57.803
Social media sites like
FriendAgenda and PicThread--

33:57.836 --> 34:00.072
they use this,
uh, proximity-based

34:00.106 --> 34:01.373
algorithm, right?
RAVEN: Right.

34:01.407 --> 34:03.842
To determine who shows up
in this section.

34:03.875 --> 34:05.611
They actually
suggest people

34:05.644 --> 34:08.747
that you have
physically been around.

34:08.780 --> 34:11.183
I downloaded the, uh,
PicThread app this morning

34:11.217 --> 34:13.252
just to check it out.
Okay, so I have

34:13.285 --> 34:14.220
zero followers, right?

34:14.253 --> 34:16.855
So if I go to my

34:16.888 --> 34:18.657
"people you may know" section,

34:18.690 --> 34:21.127
(chuckling):
then...

34:21.160 --> 34:22.060
(laughing): Oh...

34:22.861 --> 34:24.763
Look at all of 'em.

34:24.796 --> 34:26.132
And you, who are standing

34:26.165 --> 34:27.233
right next to me,

34:27.266 --> 34:28.700
are number one
on my list.

34:28.734 --> 34:30.436
She was physically near

34:30.469 --> 34:33.705
all of her victims while she was
staging their murders.

34:33.739 --> 34:35.607
All right, so they would
show up in that section.

34:35.641 --> 34:36.875
Yeah, already on it.

34:36.908 --> 34:40.179
Pastor Harrison.

34:40.212 --> 34:41.813
Nicole Hogan.

34:41.847 --> 34:42.881
Ryan Kilmer.

34:42.914 --> 34:45.551
So in order to figure out
who Sasha's

34:45.584 --> 34:48.120
Trolling victim might be,
we need to...

34:48.154 --> 34:49.688
All we need to do is cross-
reference the PicThread users

34:49.721 --> 34:51.290
in the Boston area
who have been flagged

34:51.323 --> 34:53.692
for trolling... with the users

34:53.725 --> 34:55.861
of Sasha's
"people you may know."

34:55.894 --> 34:57.563
Toby Allen.

34:57.596 --> 34:59.398
Sasha's
next victim.

34:59.431 --> 35:02.134
You guys, his phone is on.

35:02.168 --> 35:03.635
We have his location.

35:03.669 --> 35:04.636
It's an abandoned theater.

35:04.670 --> 35:06.205
And Sasha might be

35:06.238 --> 35:07.273
right there with him.

35:09.741 --> 35:11.610
Now, I'll only be gone
a couple of hours,

35:11.643 --> 35:14.813
but it's very important
that you see every photo.

35:14.846 --> 35:17.916
You can't miss one.
That's the job.

35:17.949 --> 35:19.851
You look away for a
second and you can

35:19.885 --> 35:21.920
miss something
that gets posted.

35:21.953 --> 35:24.156
(muffled grunting)

35:24.190 --> 35:26.192
Don't go anywhere, okay?

35:26.225 --> 35:27.226
(grunting)

35:38.870 --> 35:42.708
Toby, are you enjoying
those photos?

35:42.741 --> 35:43.942
No!

35:43.975 --> 35:46.345
RYAN:
Sasha, freeze! FBI!

35:46.378 --> 35:47.679
Put the gun down!

35:48.880 --> 35:51.717
Wow, I'm impressed.

35:51.750 --> 35:53.785
How the hell did
you find me here?

35:53.819 --> 35:55.687
We found Toby Allen.

35:55.721 --> 35:58.490
He's now safely in our custody.

35:58.524 --> 36:00.859
It's over, Sasha.
You will not harm

36:00.892 --> 36:02.794
another innocent person.

36:03.795 --> 36:04.763
Innocent?

36:04.796 --> 36:06.732
A man preaching hate

36:06.765 --> 36:09.268
instead of love?

36:09.301 --> 36:12.571
A woman so full of herself
she documents everything,

36:12.604 --> 36:13.839
no matter how indecent?

36:13.872 --> 36:17.243
A heroin addict
glorifying his disease

36:17.276 --> 36:18.777
and recruiting
other users?

36:19.845 --> 36:21.880
And this one...

36:21.913 --> 36:24.650
worst of all.

36:24.683 --> 36:26.452
An Internet Troll

36:26.485 --> 36:29.621
who taunts depressed teens
into committing suicide,

36:29.655 --> 36:31.690
then posts doctored photos
mocking them

36:31.723 --> 36:34.626
on their own memorial sites.
How sick is that?

36:34.660 --> 36:36.528
It's wrong.

36:36.562 --> 36:39.265
It's illegal and immoral.

36:39.298 --> 36:41.667
But Sasha...

36:41.700 --> 36:44.270
what you've done
is so much worse.

36:45.604 --> 36:48.607
I have seen the worst images

36:48.640 --> 36:50.609
flooding in.

36:50.642 --> 36:51.943
All day.

36:51.977 --> 36:55.881
Every day.

36:55.914 --> 36:56.982
The solution...

36:57.015 --> 36:58.984
isn't removing...

36:59.017 --> 37:01.520
what gets posted.

37:01.553 --> 37:03.489
It's preventing people
from violating

37:03.522 --> 37:05.691
the five abuse standards
in the first place.

37:05.724 --> 37:07.926
Sending a clear message
that such behavior

37:07.959 --> 37:09.761
will not be tolerated!

37:09.795 --> 37:11.597
Sasha...

37:11.630 --> 37:13.399
what you saw was terrible.

37:14.933 --> 37:17.503
You need help.

37:17.536 --> 37:19.538
Drop that gun.

37:19.571 --> 37:21.573
I can help you.

37:22.808 --> 37:24.810
You're right.

37:26.945 --> 37:28.947
You can help me.

37:31.817 --> 37:34.653
By making sure
my message gets heard.

37:37.689 --> 37:38.790
Sasha, no, no!

37:38.824 --> 37:40.292
(gunshot)
(echoing): No!

37:44.430 --> 37:45.431
(body thuds)

37:49.601 --> 37:50.969
(indistinct police
radio communication)

37:52.471 --> 37:54.940
MUNDO:
She's wearing a QR code.

37:54.973 --> 37:58.477
Her plan was to die all along.

37:58.510 --> 37:59.978
Kill Toby Allen,
then kill herself.

38:00.011 --> 38:01.747
RYAN:
She was Violence.

38:01.780 --> 38:05.584
Sasha posted gruesome
photos of her victims.

38:05.617 --> 38:08.354
This was her fifth
and final message.

38:08.387 --> 38:11.723
Well, if there are no more
bodies, what's the QR Code for?

38:29.107 --> 38:30.342
Huh, that's weird.

38:30.376 --> 38:31.843
What do you got?
Sasha's QR code

38:31.877 --> 38:34.112
is a link to someone's
PicThread account.

38:34.145 --> 38:36.047
Click on it.

38:36.081 --> 38:37.749
KRUMITZ:
Avery, are you sure?

38:37.783 --> 38:39.985
It could blast another photo.
It won't.

38:40.018 --> 38:42.354
Whatever it links to
will be her final message.

38:42.388 --> 38:43.355
All right.

38:43.389 --> 38:44.356
(taps key)

38:44.390 --> 38:46.392
RAVEN:
It's Sasha's profile.

38:46.425 --> 38:49.027
RUSSELL:
She posted something new
ten minutes ago.

38:49.060 --> 38:51.029
How's that
possible?
Could be time-released.

38:51.062 --> 38:54.866
RUSSELL: "I died for you sins.
Keep social media clean."

38:54.900 --> 38:56.668
The press must have
leaked Sasha's name.

38:56.702 --> 38:57.769
Check out those comments.

38:57.803 --> 39:01.873
NELSON: Damn. People
are coming here to support her.

39:01.907 --> 39:04.976
Calling the DOJ about getting
this profile taken down.

39:05.977 --> 39:07.145
RUSSELL:
The last thing we need

39:07.178 --> 39:09.381
are copycats.

39:17.889 --> 39:19.858
(monitor beeping steadily)

39:19.891 --> 39:22.861
I'm happy you came to see me
at the bar.

39:24.095 --> 39:26.097
Even if you were so upset.

39:28.934 --> 39:30.936
Gave me a chance
to see Elijah again.

39:35.006 --> 39:37.609
Tragedy does really
bring people together.

39:44.916 --> 39:47.519
I had to wear a wig
to sneak in and see you.

39:47.553 --> 39:49.988
I hope you still know
it's me, Nina.

40:07.606 --> 40:08.607
Hey, Dad.
