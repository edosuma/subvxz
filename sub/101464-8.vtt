02:38.074 --> 02:40.076
What do you mean, "going back"?

02:40.160 --> 02:42.912
When we switched tracks,
we ended up on one headed north.

02:47.125 --> 02:50.378
We're not going to the south docks,
we're going away from them!

02:51.713 --> 02:54.007
[grunts] Doesn't anything here work?

02:56.217 --> 02:58.553
We gotta get off this monorail now!

[Brooklynn pants]

03:05.184 --> 03:08.855
Oh! T-The track dips down up ahead!
We can jump there!

03:08.938 --> 03:10.023
-[Kenji] What?
-Jump?

03:10.106 --> 03:11.524
We can't! It's too far to jump!

03:55.902 --> 03:59.113
[grunts] "Ish." Are you?

03:59.197 --> 04:01.282
Bumpy. Where's Bumpy?

04:02.075 --> 04:05.411
I lost her when I hit the ground.
She's gotta be here.

04:05.495 --> 04:08.581
-Bumpy? Bumpy!
-Shh!

04:08.665 --> 04:12.126
There are still dinosaurs out here,
including Toro and--

04:12.210 --> 04:13.086
Bumpy!

04:13.795 --> 04:16.381
-Bumpy!
-We gotta look for her, don't we?

04:16.464 --> 04:20.426

04:29.852 --> 04:32.522
No chance we could get there in an hour!
It's way too far!

04:32.605 --> 04:35.525
-Not if we leave right now!
-But Bumpy, and Ben...!

04:35.608 --> 04:37.360
We can't go back for Ben!

04:37.860 --> 04:39.112
Ben's...

04:40.196 --> 04:41.239
gone.

04:48.621 --> 04:51.499
There's just not enough time
to look for...

04:53.960 --> 04:57.380
We can make it to the ferry,
but only if we go now.

05:10.226 --> 05:11.978
We have to go!

05:19.819 --> 05:22.071
Repeat! Roxie and I saw you
on the monorail,

05:22.155 --> 05:23.573
we're headed to the docks to meet you.

-[static crackles]
-Darius, do you copy?

05:27.994 --> 05:30.580
If you can hear me,
just get to the boats, okay?

05:30.663 --> 05:33.458
Don't stop, just keep going.
Just keep going!

05:33.541 --> 05:35.084
[crackling continues]

05:35.752 --> 05:37.503
They're gonna be okay, Dave.

05:38.713 --> 05:40.298
They have to be.

05:45.553 --> 05:48.514

-Are you all--
-I'm fine.

05:58.191 --> 06:00.193
-It's so...
-[Yasmina grunts]

06:00.276 --> 06:05.031
-[sighs] How are you even walking?
-I'm highly motivated.

06:05.782 --> 06:07.241
I got this.

06:07.742 --> 06:09.744
[grunts, screams]

06:10.286 --> 06:13.372
She can't keep up like this.
What do we do?

06:14.248 --> 06:16.709
We can't stop, so,
we'll make a stretcher, maybe?

06:16.876 --> 06:19.087
Or maybe there's a shortcut or...

06:19.587 --> 06:21.130
the tunnels! Kenji!

06:22.131 --> 06:24.425
-[grunts]
-Kenji! The maintenance tunnels.

06:24.592 --> 06:26.761
There has to be one that leads
to the docks, right?

06:28.054 --> 06:29.847
Kenji, right?

06:31.682 --> 06:33.684

This'll get us to the dock
in half the time.

06:52.578 --> 06:55.456
[Brooklynn] Are we sure "Mr. VIP"
knows what he's doing?

06:55.540 --> 06:56.999
Kenji took me down here before.

06:57.166 --> 07:01.212
Just trust him.
We'll be outta here in no... time.

07:01.587 --> 07:04.966
Everything looks different with the lights
all freaky like this, okay?

07:05.049 --> 07:05.967
This way.

07:09.595 --> 07:11.097
No!

07:11.597 --> 07:13.641
[pants, sputters]

07:16.519 --> 07:18.688
[panting]

07:20.606 --> 07:21.441
What?

07:21.899 --> 07:25.153
-This wasn't here before!
-Why are there so many security gates?

07:25.236 --> 07:28.072
The evacuation. The park
must be locking down automatically!

07:28.156 --> 07:32.076
Oh, we have to go 'round! [huffs]
This way!

07:33.619 --> 07:36.789

-Unbelievable.
-Kenji!

08:13.701 --> 08:14.994
-You said--

-Just try to remember. Breathe--

08:25.671 --> 08:28.549
What do you think I'm doing?
Coming down here was your idea,

08:28.633 --> 08:30.718
so just back off!

08:31.052 --> 08:33.346
Uh, Kenji? Darius?

08:33.429 --> 08:37.141
The way we came from...
where does that tunnel end?

08:37.225 --> 08:39.769
It opens up into the park, I guess.
Why do you--

Okay, that's it, everybody, there we go!
Keep movin'! This way!

08:53.449 --> 08:55.952
There were six teenagers.
You're sure you didn't see them?

08:56.118 --> 08:59.705
What? No, I didn't notice six kids
in the middle of thousands of people here!

08:59.872 --> 09:02.208
Right this way, sir.
Keep moving, sir, thank you.

09:02.291 --> 09:04.794
You know, we're kind of in the
middle of an emergency evacuation!

09:04.877 --> 09:07.672
Yeah, picked up on that.
Where's Claire Dearing?

09:07.755 --> 09:09.549
-Who?
-Perfect!

09:09.632 --> 09:11.676
Rox, come on.
We gotta go back and look for 'em.

09:11.842 --> 09:15.221
No, absolutely not.
You are being evacuated.

09:15.304 --> 09:17.431
-Are you gonna stop us?
-Yes, ma'am. I am.

09:17.515 --> 09:19.892
That's my job.
Now, you can stay here to search,

09:19.976 --> 09:23.813
but the last ferry departs in 25 minutes
and you need to be on it.

09:24.021 --> 09:25.940
And if we refuse?

09:26.023 --> 09:29.694
Then so help me, you'll be physically
placed on that boat.

09:31.070 --> 09:34.323
And what if we refuse politely?

09:36.367 --> 09:39.870

10:00.141 --> 10:02.977
Seriously, Kenji? It's like a foot tall!

10:03.060 --> 10:05.855
And, uh... not alone.

10:05.938 --> 10:09.191
[snarling]

10:09.442 --> 10:11.319
We need to go. In a group, Compies can--

10:11.402 --> 10:13.779
Not really the time for a lesson,
dino-nerd!

10:13.863 --> 10:18.492
Why not? It's not like you've gotten us
anywhere close to the dock, Mr. VIP!

10:18.618 --> 10:21.203
Oh! Yeah, I'm sorry.
Don't you have some sort of

10:21.287 --> 10:24.665
"unboxing being a brat all the time"
video to be shooting?

10:24.749 --> 10:26.542
-[scoffs]
-Hey! Calm yourselves!

10:26.626 --> 10:29.295
You're scaring
the itty-bitty Compy family.

10:29.378 --> 10:32.590
"Scaring the"--? Are you for real?

10:32.673 --> 10:35.676
After everything,
you're defending the dinosaurs?

10:35.760 --> 10:38.220
It's not her fault you got us lost!

10:38.304 --> 10:40.681
[scoffs] It's definitely her fault
for some of this.

10:40.806 --> 10:43.726
Let it go, Yaz! It's just a phone!

10:43.893 --> 10:46.437
Wait, what?
I don't even know what's going on anymore.

10:46.520 --> 10:49.607
-Guys! Just stop--

-There's gotta be a door or...
-[Brooklynn] There's no way out.

13:22.885 --> 13:25.846
Ugh! They must've sealed it off
after the park was finished.

13:25.930 --> 13:30.559
Ugh! Can't anyone associated with
this place make just one good decision?

13:43.739 --> 13:44.573
I don't know.

13:46.450 --> 13:48.410
-[roar in distance]
-[all gasp]

13:50.996 --> 13:53.082
-But you always know.
-I don't know!

13:58.379 --> 13:59.880
I don't know what to do.

14:00.923 --> 14:04.468
I didn't know what to do about Ben,
or Bumpy,

14:04.552 --> 14:07.263
or when the Indominus rex attacked.

14:07.346 --> 14:09.348

14:10.975 --> 14:13.519
[hyperventilates, grunts]

14:16.272 --> 14:18.899
All I did was make bad choices
and get into trouble

14:18.983 --> 14:20.484
and mess everything up.

14:21.026 --> 14:21.860
[grunts]

14:22.653 --> 14:24.363
You never should've trusted me.

14:25.322 --> 14:27.199
I should've just stayed home.

14:27.908 --> 14:32.121
I'm a dino-nerd who played a video game,
and I'm no good at this.

14:33.747 --> 14:35.666
[Kenji] But you are.

14:36.917 --> 14:37.835
Good at this.

14:37.918 --> 14:41.797
I mean, like, I'm sure you're fine
at video games, too, not downplaying that,

14:41.881 --> 14:46.594
but... none of us would have known
what to do, Darius.

14:46.760 --> 14:51.181
But because you didn't give up,
we didn't give up either.

14:51.348 --> 14:55.102
You kept us goin',
no matter what some of us have done.

14:55.185 --> 14:57.605
You made us feel like
we were in this together.

14:58.647 --> 15:00.441
So, we are.

15:00.900 --> 15:03.611
We're a team. We're your team.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.112
[Brooklynn] Things fall apart.

15:05.821 --> 15:08.824
And that's okay
because when that happens...

15:10.117 --> 15:13.495
We pick up the pieces and we keep going.

15:21.545 --> 15:22.546
[grunts]

15:25.382 --> 15:29.261
-[Toro roars]
-[Brooklynn whispers] He's getting closer.

15:31.639 --> 15:33.557
Let's see what's in these crates.

15:36.018 --> 15:37.770
Come on, something pointy!

15:37.853 --> 15:40.022
Come on, something hurty!

15:40.105 --> 15:41.440
Come on...

15:42.483 --> 15:43.442
Ugh!

15:43.734 --> 15:45.569
Medical supplies?

15:46.570 --> 15:49.740
We had these around the house
after my dad got sick. [grunts]

15:49.823 --> 15:52.618
Super compressed air,
sensitive to pressure and heat!

15:52.701 --> 15:54.495
Might be able to scare Toro off.

15:54.578 --> 15:57.998
Or distract him long enough
for us to find another exit.

15:59.500 --> 16:02.044
Kenji, Brooklynn, let's get this crate
loaded on that cart.

16:02.127 --> 16:04.546
Sammy, use those bandages
and tape to make a fuse.

16:04.630 --> 16:06.674
We're gonna need something
to light it with.

16:06.757 --> 16:08.550

16:14.848 --> 16:18.268

16:39.039 --> 16:40.082
Light it up.

16:40.499 --> 16:43.460
[electricity sputtering]

16:43.961 --> 16:46.672
-Yaz?
-[whispers] I'm trying! It won't light!

16:46.755 --> 16:48.716
Wait! Hand sanitizer!

16:48.882 --> 16:50.175
This stuff will burn!

16:53.762 --> 16:55.764
-Thanks, Ben.
-Now!

[all grunt]

-Where?
-Anywhere!

Is everyone okay?

19:21.827 --> 19:24.955
Uh, surprisingly, yeah.

19:25.038 --> 19:29.418
[chuckles] Whoo-hoo! We did it. We beat...

Yeah! That's what you get!
Take that, Toro! [grunts]

20:20.177 --> 20:21.345
That's how you do it!

20:26.850 --> 20:30.312
[roaring]

I thought we were goners!
Oh, that was scary!

20:38.737 --> 20:40.405
Doesn't get better than that.

20:41.865 --> 20:42.991

21:07.724 --> 21:08.892
[Darius] They're gone.

21:10.477 --> 21:11.645
They're all gone.

21:14.189 --> 21:16.108
They'll be back for us, won't they?

21:18.110 --> 21:19.069
Of course they will.

21:19.653 --> 21:22.072
And until then, we've got each other.

21:22.406 --> 21:24.074
Right, Mr. VIP?

21:24.157 --> 21:26.118
Absolutely, Dino-nerd.

21:26.201 --> 21:29.079
Hey, don't forget "superstar."

21:29.371 --> 21:30.330
Barf.

21:35.252 --> 21:36.712
[Darius's voice] <i>We thought it'd be fun.</i>

21:37.337 --> 21:39.172
<i>We thought we'd be safe.</i>

21:39.756 --> 21:43.510

21:43.719 --> 21:47.306
<i>Claws, teeth, screaming...</i>

21:47.681 --> 21:49.266
<i>So much screaming.</i>

-<i>Despite all the hardships,</i>
-Turn this boat around.

21:53.478 --> 21:55.314

22:00.277 --> 22:01.862

22:02.279 --> 22:04.072

22:04.990 --> 22:06.908
