Narrator:
Previously on  rogue...

00:09.342 --> 00:11.577
-What is this?
-Guns for product.

00:12.145 --> 00:14.146
Are you telling me
marty stein is a drug dealer?

00:14.148 --> 00:17.282
Stein ain't no dealer,
stein's a kingpin.

00:17.284 --> 00:19.952
We need you to tell marlon
you know where
leo's hiding out.

00:19.954 --> 00:21.353
          I do?

00:21.355 --> 00:23.422
We're gonna give you
an address where
we'll be waiting.

00:25.025 --> 00:26.959
 -What's this?
-Peace offering.

00:26.961 --> 00:29.828
Her brother's about to walk in
into some sort of sting
operation with the feds

00:29.830 --> 00:32.097
And said she was gonna
drag you down with him.

00:35.135 --> 00:36.535
    -Dea.
-Drop your weapon.

00:36.537 --> 00:37.636
Drop your fucking weapon.

00:37.638 --> 00:40.039
-We can stop this right now.
-It's too fucking late.

00:40.041 --> 00:41.940
  -Where is he?
    -Fuck you!

00:42.242 --> 00:43.308
        Where...

00:45.045 --> 00:46.145
        (gasps)

00:50.583 --> 00:51.650
          Hello.

00:53.153 --> 00:54.720
Oh. Oh, dear god.

00:57.090 --> 00:58.791
What the fuck you doing? Hey!

00:59.159 --> 01:00.225
        Harper?

01:03.496 --> 01:05.564

02:46.833 --> 02:48.233
What the fuck is this?

02:48.868 --> 02:50.502
Why do you have
hutchings' camera?

02:50.504 --> 02:52.538
      -What?
-Why did you have
hutchings' camera?

02:52.540 --> 02:54.973
That's what this is about?
You couldn't just ask me?

02:54.975 --> 02:57.242
Did you get it before
or after the murder?

02:57.844 --> 02:59.912
I'm worried about you, I am.

03:02.615 --> 03:03.882
I gotta take a piss.

03:04.651 --> 03:05.951
I do. I really fucking do.

03:06.352 --> 03:07.886
Why would you
withhold that from me?

03:08.221 --> 03:10.489
(chuckles) I didn't know it
was hutchings' camera.

03:10.491 --> 03:12.491
You didn't know it was
hutchings' camera?

03:12.493 --> 03:15.294
I wanted to take some
sexy shots of lily,

03:15.296 --> 03:17.963
You know, boudoir lingerie,
I don't fucking know,

03:17.965 --> 03:20.566
So I go down to evidence
and I grab a camera,

03:20.568 --> 03:23.035
And I didn't know
it was hutchings',
big fucking deal.

03:24.871 --> 03:26.872
-It's lowry.
-Oh, what are
you gonna tell him?

03:29.209 --> 03:30.909
      -Jesus...
      -Deakins.

03:31.311 --> 03:34.146
-Did you run an op
outside the task force?
-I can explain.

03:34.148 --> 03:35.414
Is finnegan with you?

03:35.416 --> 03:37.916
-He's right next to me.
-Did he know about this?

03:37.918 --> 03:40.452
             -No.
        <i>-Listen, you get</i>
   <i>your ass in here right now,</i>

03:40.987 --> 03:42.221
And bring him with you.

03:42.422 --> 03:43.655
He's puking his guts out.

03:44.057 --> 03:45.657
Something he ate.
I gotta take him home.

03:50.396 --> 03:51.496
You didn't yell for help.

03:52.065 --> 03:54.399
-What?
-When I was on with lowry.

03:54.401 --> 03:56.134
If you had me
handcuffed to the handrail,

03:57.070 --> 03:59.037
And you were on with my boss
and I had nothing to hide,

03:59.039 --> 04:00.639
I'd be screaming
my fucking head off.

04:00.873 --> 04:03.775
Hmm. Maybe I didn't scream
my fucking head off

04:03.777 --> 04:07.913
Because I was trying to hide
from my boss that my partner
has gone fucking crazy.

04:07.915 --> 04:10.282
But you didn't tell him
that I'm dirty, did you?

04:10.284 --> 04:12.584
-So, maybe you
don't believe it.
-Gimme your phone.

04:13.753 --> 04:15.220
-You're nuts.
-Gimme your fucking phone

04:15.222 --> 04:16.454
Or I'm calling
lowry back right fucking now.

04:16.457 --> 04:17.522
You're fucking...
 You're nuts.

04:19.091 --> 04:20.158
Where the fuck are you going?

04:20.892 --> 04:23.161
You're done sabotaging
my investigation.

04:23.763 --> 04:24.863
Patrick: Come on!

04:25.398 --> 04:26.498
          Fuck!

04:27.133 --> 04:28.333
Officer:
Why didn't you call 911?

04:29.435 --> 04:31.436
You keep asking me
these questions, man,

04:31.771 --> 04:33.939
When you should be
out there trying to
find out who did this.

04:33.941 --> 04:35.274
Sir, I'm gonna have to
ask you to calm down.

04:35.276 --> 04:37.409
Listen, some motherfucker
killed my sister!

04:37.411 --> 04:38.910
You're asking me to
calm the fuck down?

04:38.912 --> 04:40.245
Calm down. Stop struggling.

04:40.247 --> 04:41.713
Sir, stop struggling.

04:41.715 --> 04:42.981
        (gasps)

04:54.661 --> 04:55.861
What's going on?

04:57.597 --> 04:58.664
        (sighs)

04:59.799 --> 05:00.966
(clears throat)

05:00.968 --> 05:03.302
(inhales deeply)

05:03.304 --> 05:04.503
I took a shower.

05:06.172 --> 05:07.506
 In the middle
of the morning?

05:09.909 --> 05:11.209
What happened, marty?

05:12.612 --> 05:13.812
(cell phone rings)

05:13.814 --> 05:14.880
            Oh.

05:16.482 --> 05:17.649
    Marty stein.

05:17.651 --> 05:19.551
Someone killed, um, talia.

05:21.187 --> 05:24.556
I'm down at the
northwestern cpd.

05:29.095 --> 05:30.162
        (sighs)

05:31.030 --> 05:32.097
          Hello?

05:32.865 --> 05:33.932
          Marty?

05:35.435 --> 05:39.171
(sighs) marlon, do not say
one fucking word
until I get there.

05:39.173 --> 05:40.238
    You hear me?

05:41.274 --> 05:42.607
          Yeah.

05:42.609 --> 05:44.076
Bring my clothes too.

05:47.513 --> 05:48.580
        (sniffs)

05:56.556 --> 05:57.622
          Marty?

06:02.695 --> 06:03.762
  Talia's dead.

06:05.531 --> 06:07.232
       -Marty?
      -Not now.

06:07.234 --> 06:10.635
Ethan, I need to
see you right away.

06:29.822 --> 06:30.889
(harper clears throat)

06:31.557 --> 06:32.724
          Door.

06:37.730 --> 06:39.564
Do you have a problem
with my leadership, deakins?

06:39.566 --> 06:40.732
        No, sir.

06:40.734 --> 06:42.100
Then why did you go
outside this task force

06:42.102 --> 06:43.902
And run an op without
informing me?

06:43.904 --> 06:45.670
I needed to act quickly.

06:45.672 --> 06:47.873
You made me look like
I don't know what's going on
with my own agents.

06:47.875 --> 06:51.376
I made you look good
by bringing in jason williams
on a conspiracy charge.

06:51.378 --> 06:53.912
You are on thin ice, deakins.

06:53.914 --> 06:55.013
Can I speak to him now?

06:55.915 --> 06:57.482
He's waiting on
his public defender.

06:58.251 --> 07:00.452
Where happened to his fancy
lake shore representation?

07:02.455 --> 07:03.522
  No one showed.

07:14.267 --> 07:16.935
There's no evidence that
my client had any intent...

07:16.937 --> 07:18.003
That's bullshit.

07:19.405 --> 07:21.740
We have him breaking
down a door with
an m16 in his hands.

07:21.742 --> 07:23.108
Where's my lawyer at?

07:23.110 --> 07:25.076
How come I gotta
have this dumbfuck?

07:25.078 --> 07:26.344
Yours didn't show up.

07:26.979 --> 07:28.547
Harper: Marlon
gave you up, jason,

07:28.549 --> 07:30.582
He's not gonna send
any fancy lawyers.

07:30.584 --> 07:32.784
One person had that address...

07:32.786 --> 07:34.786
Marlon. Provided by me.

07:35.788 --> 07:37.222
That's game, set and match.

07:38.157 --> 07:39.224
  He set you up.

07:40.293 --> 07:42.027
Marlon's not gonna
save you this time, son.

07:42.728 --> 07:44.463
It's time to start
telling the truth.

07:51.938 --> 07:53.038
Harper: You know who that is?

07:55.808 --> 07:56.875
          Nope.

08:01.647 --> 08:02.881
What about him?

08:06.352 --> 08:07.819
          Nope.

08:07.821 --> 08:10.489
Really? That's leo.
That's the guy you
were sent to kill.

08:11.624 --> 08:14.259
He's already id'd you
as being there that night.

08:33.446 --> 08:35.179
You remember your
little brother though, right?

08:41.721 --> 08:43.455
We never found out
who did that to him.

08:48.528 --> 08:50.629
 I liked him.
He was a good kid.

08:52.698 --> 08:53.765
  He liked you.

08:55.535 --> 08:56.701
He looked up to you.

08:59.405 --> 09:01.206
He wasn't cut out for no gang.

09:02.708 --> 09:04.309
Needed looking out for.

09:06.712 --> 09:08.847
You should've
looked out for him.
He was your little brother.

09:08.849 --> 09:11.249
-I looked out for him.
-No one cared about him.
No one fucking cared.

09:11.251 --> 09:12.751
I cared. I did.
He was my brother.

09:12.753 --> 09:14.252
Did you love him, jason?

09:19.058 --> 09:20.158
Did you love him?

09:23.829 --> 09:26.898
It's a simple question,
you don't need
a lawyer for this one.

09:27.500 --> 09:30.135
-Did you love him or not?
-Yes, of course
I fucking loved him...

09:33.239 --> 09:35.240
Someone found out he
was snitching, didn't they?

09:35.242 --> 09:36.741
Someone inside the kings?

09:37.543 --> 09:38.910
So, who took him down?

09:40.413 --> 09:41.580
    Was it cups?

09:42.448 --> 09:43.848
It was cups, wasn't it?

09:46.285 --> 09:48.720
Okay, but he didn't
order the hit, right?

09:48.722 --> 09:49.921
That was marlon, wasn't it?

09:51.090 --> 09:52.490
Had to come
from the top, right?

09:55.761 --> 09:57.062
And here you are,
protecting him,

09:57.064 --> 10:00.098
Protecting the man who
killed your little brother.

10:02.268 --> 10:04.135
You gonna go
down for this, jason,

10:04.137 --> 10:05.804
Or you gonna go down
for some bullshit notion

10:05.806 --> 10:08.607
That you've gotta protect
the scumbag who ordered
your own brother

10:08.609 --> 10:10.442
To be shot like a fucking dog?

10:14.880 --> 10:16.214
Who ordered the hit on leo?

10:17.116 --> 10:18.516
Who ordered the hit on leo?

10:24.123 --> 10:25.190
  Marlon dinard.

10:36.268 --> 10:37.802
Where'd you get the m16?

10:42.808 --> 10:44.943
Marlon has a storage locker.

10:44.945 --> 10:46.344
    (door opens)

11:00.192 --> 11:04.362
I got a situation.
I need to know if you
are with me or you're not.

11:04.364 --> 11:05.730
Well, it depends
 on what it is.

11:07.199 --> 11:09.334
Marlon is in custody
and talia's dead.

11:10.603 --> 11:13.104
-I'm listening.
-I need to move some guns.

11:13.639 --> 11:15.974
Lots of 'em.
More precisely,
you need you to move 'em,

11:15.976 --> 11:19.611
     M4s, m16s,
grenade launchers...
    Lotta shit.

11:21.013 --> 11:23.314
Marty stein,
the gun runner, huh?

11:23.316 --> 11:24.749
I didn't see that one coming.

11:25.484 --> 11:27.352
You wanted in my business?
That's my business.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.020
Yeah, well,
I'm not interested.

11:29.022 --> 11:31.089
I'm not a fucking courier,
get someone else to do it.

11:31.824 --> 11:36.428
I believe, were it not for me
you'd be on your way
to a federal pen

11:37.129 --> 11:38.196
    As we speak.

11:40.633 --> 11:42.033
You're sure you
wanna use that card?

11:42.835 --> 11:44.769
-You only get one of them.
-I wanna use that card.

11:51.377 --> 11:53.812
Okay. Where do I go?

11:55.381 --> 11:57.315
Where you pick 'em up,
where you drop 'em off.

11:57.917 --> 12:00.385
There's a union contact
on there,
he'll give you a truck.

12:00.387 --> 12:01.653
Call me when you're done.

12:12.598 --> 12:13.665
        Deakins.

12:19.538 --> 12:22.440
Jason's saying there's
a shitload of guns
in that locker,

12:22.442 --> 12:23.842
The whole kings' stash.

12:25.244 --> 12:26.478
We gotta move fast if we're
gonna get them off the street.

12:27.546 --> 12:28.813
Talia freeman's dead.

12:34.420 --> 12:36.121
   -When? Uh...
  -This morning.

12:37.256 --> 12:39.290
Aunt came home from church,
saw marlon dinard
sitting there,

12:39.292 --> 12:40.425
With her in a pool of blood.

12:41.927 --> 12:43.695
Cpd has him over
at northwestern.

12:46.632 --> 12:48.600
That's your second
cl in a month.

12:49.235 --> 12:50.635
        I know.

12:50.637 --> 12:52.971
Ia's gonna wanna talk to you
and I can't have your back,

12:52.973 --> 12:55.473
Because didn't think to
bring me in on the fucking op!

12:55.475 --> 12:57.475
-I'm sorry.
-God damn it, deakins.

13:02.748 --> 13:04.015
You make sure
they hold marlon.

13:05.484 --> 13:07.952
He must've found
out she turned,
that's motive right there.

13:11.457 --> 13:13.324
But right now,
we need to get
our hands on those guns.

14:28.033 --> 14:29.100
  (siren blares)

14:34.974 --> 14:37.342
Hands in the air!
In the air, now.

14:37.344 --> 14:38.443
            Now!

14:39.578 --> 14:40.912
Step away, mr. Kelly.

14:44.750 --> 14:46.117
You're here for
another interview?

14:51.090 --> 14:52.423
Let's check this out.

15:13.746 --> 15:15.513
You better not be
talking to my client.

15:15.515 --> 15:16.915
Busy morning, stein?

15:16.917 --> 15:20.385
-Just the usual crap
from your office.
-Not this time.

15:20.387 --> 15:23.454
Your client was found
at the crime scene, holding
the body of the victim.

15:23.456 --> 15:25.757
Jesus christ, fred,
can you be more callous?

15:25.759 --> 15:27.191
The body was his sister.

15:27.193 --> 15:28.693
And then there's
the conspiracy charge.

15:30.229 --> 15:33.031
Word just came down
from my counterpart
in the gang taskforce,

15:33.033 --> 15:34.999
 One of
mr. Dinard's associates,

15:35.267 --> 15:36.367
A jason williams,

15:38.103 --> 15:41.172
Has named him as
co-conspirator in a murder
attempt on a federal witness.

15:46.045 --> 15:48.947
I'd would like a moment
alone with my client,
if you will?

16:01.126 --> 16:03.695
What were you doing at
the storage locker, mr. Kelly?

16:04.096 --> 16:05.997
I was moving
furniture for a friend.

16:07.633 --> 16:11.135
-Your truck was empty.
-Oh, I was checking
the space out first.

16:12.604 --> 16:15.807
You keep popping up
in my investigation
in the strangest ways.

16:16.608 --> 16:18.142
    Why is that?

16:18.144 --> 16:20.845
I don't know, uh,
maybe you're not
very good at your job.

16:22.314 --> 16:23.648
First,
at adam hutchings' house.

16:23.650 --> 16:25.783
The same adam hutchings who
was harassing lawyers

16:25.785 --> 16:27.819
At marty stein's firm,
the firm you work for.

16:27.821 --> 16:29.654
That's a coincidence,
don't you think?

16:30.322 --> 16:34.292
Then your face appears
on a fake passport at a
print shop run by the kings.

16:34.294 --> 16:36.227
 -Mmm.
-Coincidence number two.

16:37.429 --> 16:38.563
  And now this.

16:39.698 --> 16:41.165
 You add up
enough coincidences,

16:41.167 --> 16:43.167
You got yourself
a class-a felony.

16:43.769 --> 16:45.570
Am I under arrest,
special agent deakins?

16:46.005 --> 16:47.805
-Does it matter?
  -Excuse me?

16:47.807 --> 16:49.640
  You'd just make a call, have
  someone get you out of here,

16:49.642 --> 16:50.842
Like last time.

16:50.844 --> 16:52.210
I didn't realize that's
the way it went down.

16:52.711 --> 16:54.545
You see, I thought you
just came to your senses.

16:55.381 --> 16:56.781
-You know what I think?
 -Hmm?

16:57.216 --> 16:59.217
I think marty stein got
you out of here that night.

16:59.219 --> 17:00.952
-Well, that's a theory.
-Here's another...

17:00.954 --> 17:03.454
Marty stein was involved in
the murder of adam hutchings.

17:04.690 --> 17:07.358
Well, it sounds like
you should be
talking to mr. Stein.

17:11.230 --> 17:13.698
You got a real set
of balls on you, I like that.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.800
Well, I wish I could say
the same thing about you.

17:16.367 --> 17:17.769
See? That's what
I'm talking about.

17:19.671 --> 17:22.205
If we were at a bar,
and you asked if
you could buy me a drink,

17:22.208 --> 17:24.075
I'd say,
"why don't you take a seat?"

17:25.044 --> 17:28.913
Hmm. Well. Then who knows...

17:30.149 --> 17:33.051
That's right. Who knows?

17:33.252 --> 17:35.820
-Hmm. It could be interesting.
-That it could.

17:36.388 --> 17:37.822
Unfortunately,
one of these days

17:37.824 --> 17:39.490
All of these pieces
are gonna fit together

17:39.492 --> 17:41.759
And they're gonna tell me
you're in this shit
up to your eyeballs.

17:42.327 --> 17:43.561
And then I'm gonna nail you.

17:45.564 --> 17:47.799
Agent deakins, we all have
our job to do, don't we?

17:50.669 --> 17:54.505
If you're not arresting me,
I'm done helping you do yours.

17:56.575 --> 17:59.744
 -Sorry about your
friend, aj baldwin.
      -Yeah.

17:59.746 --> 18:01.312
It's a shame
what happened to him.

18:03.115 --> 18:04.482
Well, he had a lotta issues.

18:05.851 --> 18:06.918
    But thanks.

18:07.953 --> 18:09.253
It's good to see you again,
agent deakins.

18:17.062 --> 18:18.463
Sorry about talia.

18:18.931 --> 18:21.165
(sighs) hmm. Yeah.

18:23.202 --> 18:24.469
Do you want to tell
me what happened?

18:30.943 --> 18:34.846
I came round to aunt ruth's
for Sunday brunch,

18:36.582 --> 18:38.182
And there she was
lying on the floor.

18:44.656 --> 18:46.190
        (sighs)

18:50.662 --> 18:51.963
Did you see anyone?

18:53.265 --> 18:55.299
Would I be sittin' here
right now if I saw sombody...

18:55.301 --> 18:57.268
Okay, okay. Okay, marlon.

18:57.270 --> 18:58.636
I know this is tough.

18:58.638 --> 19:01.205
I need you to
just stay with me
and just stay calm.

19:04.243 --> 19:06.010
Can you think of anyone
who might have done this?

19:06.512 --> 19:07.578
        Can you?

19:08.147 --> 19:11.482
Marlon, if you want
me to help you...

19:11.650 --> 19:14.018
Shit, man, you, man,
you know talia.

19:14.020 --> 19:16.420
-She pissed people
the fuck off.
-Enough to kill her?

19:17.856 --> 19:19.891
I got a lot of people
coming at me right now.

19:21.093 --> 19:23.494
Could be the breeds,
looking for payback for ty.

19:24.163 --> 19:25.997
But either fucking way,
when I find out,

19:26.832 --> 19:28.566
Imma punish
the motherfuckers, man.

19:29.835 --> 19:32.303
Let's just focus on
one thing at a time, aight?

19:32.305 --> 19:33.704
I'm gonna get
you out of here. And...

19:33.706 --> 19:35.573
        (sighs)

19:37.509 --> 19:39.911
-Is jason gonna hurt us?
 -What?

19:40.979 --> 19:44.348
-He knows about the guns?
-Yeah.

19:44.350 --> 19:46.050
He knows about
the storage locker?

19:46.618 --> 19:48.219
He's the one that
put 'em there, marty.

19:52.124 --> 19:55.126
Okay. Just sit tight,
I'm gonna get you out of here.

19:55.128 --> 19:56.561
I just need to
make a phone call.

19:56.563 --> 19:58.696
-You got something more
pressing right now?
-Yes, I do.

19:58.698 --> 19:59.997
I had someone
move those crates.

19:59.999 --> 20:01.465
I gotta make sure
there was no trouble.

20:01.467 --> 20:02.800
The guns ain't there, marty.

20:06.071 --> 20:08.739
-What?
-I said the guns ain't there.
I sold 'em.

20:11.043 --> 20:13.544
I'm sorry, what?

20:14.379 --> 20:15.746
You sold my guns?

20:16.215 --> 20:17.415
I traded them, more like.

20:18.584 --> 20:21.018
It solved my supply issues,
so thanks for that.

20:21.020 --> 20:22.720
Are you kidding me?

20:22.722 --> 20:24.922
Are you out of
your fucking mind?

20:24.924 --> 20:26.224
You sold them to who?

20:26.226 --> 20:28.392
Are you out of
your fucking mind?

20:28.394 --> 20:29.860
Hey, excuse me,

20:29.862 --> 20:31.996
-I said I wanted a
moment with my client!
-Marlon dinard,

20:31.998 --> 20:33.331
You're under arrest
for the murder

20:33.333 --> 20:34.732
-Of talia freeman.
-This is a joke, right?

20:34.734 --> 20:36.767
That's a sad...
That's very fucking funny.

20:36.769 --> 20:38.603
-His aunt...
-That's very fucking funny!

20:38.605 --> 20:41.205
Stein, his aunt
just informed us

20:41.207 --> 20:43.407
She saw him hitting his
sister a few days ago,

20:43.409 --> 20:45.042
Said their shit was
getting out of hand,

20:45.044 --> 20:46.344
 Said she was
frightened of him.

20:46.346 --> 20:48.512
Do you know how quickly
I can get that dismissed?

20:48.514 --> 20:50.081
You didn't let me finish.

20:50.083 --> 20:53.017
The feds say ms. Freeman
was part of
a confidential operation,

20:53.019 --> 20:55.052
In which your client
was the target.

20:55.054 --> 20:56.754
-What the fuck are
you say about talia?
-We believe...

20:56.756 --> 20:58.556
Fuck what you believe, man.

20:58.558 --> 21:01.459
We believe that he found
out she was snitching.
That's motive for murder.

21:01.461 --> 21:03.027
Marty, what the fuck
is he talking about?

21:03.029 --> 21:05.429
-What the fuck are
you talking about...
-Get him out of here.

21:05.764 --> 21:07.298
Marty, you better get the...

21:07.300 --> 21:09.033
Get me the fuck
outta here, man!

21:09.568 --> 21:10.635
      Let's go.

21:17.442 --> 21:18.509
        (sighs)

21:20.779 --> 21:22.847
      (dialing)

21:34.660 --> 21:36.060
You're sure you don't want
to keep him overnight?

21:37.062 --> 21:38.162
I'll get him eventually.

21:43.068 --> 21:45.636
I got in.
Pretty tight password.

21:45.638 --> 21:47.238
-And?
-And there's nothing on it.

21:48.240 --> 21:49.307
            Oh.

21:49.309 --> 21:52.476
-But I found a ghost.
-A ghost?

21:52.478 --> 21:54.912
Yeah, that's something
someone's trying to delete.

21:54.914 --> 21:57.848
I managed to restore it.
Well, partially, anyway.

21:59.451 --> 22:00.518
        -Thanks.
         -Sure.

22:08.994 --> 22:10.895
People call me
a conspiracy nut,

22:12.331 --> 22:14.498
But that's just a way to
dismiss what I have to say.

22:15.867 --> 22:19.070
What I write about
aren't conspiracies,

22:20.772 --> 22:23.207
They're simply the way
powerful people do business.

22:25.177 --> 22:26.277
           <i>Ready?</i>

22:31.616 --> 22:34.251
-Can you state your name?
-Norma jean.

22:35.020 --> 22:37.388
But you can call me marilyn.

22:37.390 --> 22:41.459
Are you aware that your net
worth is almost $45 million?

22:42.494 --> 22:43.928
         <i>Oh, my.</i>

22:44.363 --> 22:48.099
Now, and this
is very important,

22:50.202 --> 22:51.936
When did you
start running guns?

23:01.179 --> 23:02.279
          Shit!

23:03.815 --> 23:06.117
Docket number 387265.

23:06.318 --> 23:08.953
The state of illinois vs.
Dinard, marlon, t.

23:09.421 --> 23:11.155
Charge is murder,
first degree.

23:18.063 --> 23:19.230
How do you plead?

23:19.765 --> 23:21.565
-Not guilty.
-Remand, your honor.

23:21.567 --> 23:23.701
Your honor,
my client sells chandeliers.

23:23.703 --> 23:26.070
And in his free time,
he viciously
murdered the victim.

23:26.072 --> 23:28.873
-I'm sorry, were you there?
-I saw the crime scene photos.

23:28.875 --> 23:30.908
Oh, you saw the
crime scene photos?

23:30.910 --> 23:34.011
Well, if you would
actually bother to go
to the crime scene

23:34.013 --> 23:36.914
Instead of looking at
a few pictures
several hours after the fact,

23:36.916 --> 23:38.916
You might have seen
my client's grieving,

23:38.918 --> 23:41.752
His anguish, his shock
at finding the body.

23:41.754 --> 23:43.921
It was his little baby sister,
for christ's sake.

23:43.923 --> 23:46.223
-Mr. Stein.
-She was 29 years old.

23:46.225 --> 23:47.491
Marty: My apologies,
your honor.

23:48.894 --> 23:52.596
My point, mr. Dinard
was going to his
aunt ruthie's house

23:52.598 --> 23:55.599
For his regular Sunday
brunch with his family.

23:55.601 --> 23:59.537
He found the body of
his sister lying in
a pool of her own blood.

23:59.539 --> 24:01.105
So aunt ruth saw
 what happened?

24:01.373 --> 24:03.007
She was at church, thank god.

24:04.876 --> 24:05.943
Your honor, my...

24:06.978 --> 24:09.280
Mr. Dinard is a fixture
of the community,

24:09.282 --> 24:11.649
A small business owner,
turn of the century lighting.

24:11.651 --> 24:14.018
You probably know it,
on ashland,
across from the chick-fil-a.

24:14.553 --> 24:15.686
    Nice touch.

24:18.056 --> 24:21.459
He supports and takes care
of his elderly aunt.

24:21.461 --> 24:24.662
-He funds numerous
local charities...
-If I may, your honor,

24:24.664 --> 24:28.432
The defendant is currently
the subject of a federal
criminal investigation for,

24:28.434 --> 24:30.167
Among other things,
conspiracy to murder,

24:30.169 --> 24:31.802
Drug dealing
and money laundering.

24:33.472 --> 24:36.073
And I was just about
to give you the key
to the city, mr. Dinard.

24:36.975 --> 24:38.976
The defendant will be
held without bail.

24:39.945 --> 24:41.011
  (bangs gavel)

24:59.664 --> 25:01.265
        (sighs)

25:35.834 --> 25:39.803
-Harper: That's not my gun.
-I am still impressed
every time it works.

25:40.405 --> 25:44.208
No, diego took this
puppy off a cornerman
in the heights.

25:44.709 --> 25:48.679
Although your guy
wins the trophy for
the best of the day,

25:48.681 --> 25:53.050
'cause this,
special agent deakins,
is military surplus.

25:53.052 --> 25:55.619
 -Our military?
-Yeah, from the
delaware armory.

25:56.421 --> 26:00.157
It was sold by the us
military along with
lots of its friends to,

26:00.159 --> 26:02.293
You guessed it,
the chicago pd.

26:03.528 --> 26:05.229
-What the fuck?
-Yeah, that's what I thought.

26:05.564 --> 26:08.465
I got crate numbers,
shipment dates, etc., etc.

26:27.085 --> 26:29.453
Looks like you guys could
take on the third reich.

26:29.455 --> 26:31.255
Yeah, I took two in the
leg back in 2012.

26:31.257 --> 26:33.123
That's why they stuck me here.

26:33.125 --> 26:35.492
It's not exciting work,
but at least no one's
shooting at me, right?

26:36.428 --> 26:37.695
Oh, here you go.

26:37.697 --> 26:39.697
Forty crates left
dover, Tuesday.

26:39.699 --> 26:41.498
Forty arrived here, Wednesday.

26:41.933 --> 26:44.501
-Can I see them?
-Yeah, they are
right over there.

26:46.071 --> 26:48.005
Do you guys get
a lot of military surplus?

26:48.206 --> 26:52.076
Oh, yeah, guns,
grenades, rpgs.

26:52.078 --> 26:54.578
Costs the city half of what
the feds pay for 'em.

26:54.580 --> 26:58.315
(chuckles) yeah, you gotta
love those accelerated
troop drawdowns, huh?

26:59.050 --> 27:00.184
That's all from uncle sam.

27:01.720 --> 27:03.454
Mmm-hmm. You know,
we check the first 10
crates off the truck,

27:03.456 --> 27:05.456
Mark 'em with a red dot.
Standard procedure.

27:07.292 --> 27:08.492
I need to see the others.

27:10.095 --> 27:12.997
Yeah, uh, evans, rigby,
bring the rest in
for inspection, please.

27:18.303 --> 27:19.370
          Great.

27:20.138 --> 27:21.205
        (sighs)

27:23.508 --> 27:24.575
          Great.

27:26.144 --> 27:27.211
    Be my guest.

27:31.483 --> 27:32.549
    Here you go.

27:41.426 --> 27:42.826
      -All good?
        -Yeah.

27:44.496 --> 27:46.196
That's good. Got it.

27:53.872 --> 27:55.172
(grunts) there she goes.

27:56.708 --> 27:58.909
Looks like you guys need to
update your procedure.

28:00.011 --> 28:01.078
        (grunts)

28:04.516 --> 28:05.916
I want the man who
signed for the these.

28:25.704 --> 28:27.237
In two years, I get my 20.

28:27.239 --> 28:28.706
No one has ever
accused me of shit.

28:29.874 --> 28:31.942
Everyone gets the
cherry popped eventually.

28:33.311 --> 28:34.878
The thing is,
officer vitorelli,

28:34.880 --> 28:37.948
18 years on the job
and you still haven't
got past officer.

28:38.483 --> 28:39.550
    Why is that?

28:39.884 --> 28:42.319
(chuckles) eat me.

28:42.754 --> 28:44.655
Maybe next time. (chuckles)

28:45.590 --> 28:50.027
Right now, I wanna know why
a crate of military m16s
left dover, delaware,

28:50.029 --> 28:55.065
Weighing 322 pounds
and arrived at the
cpd armory weighing 314.

28:55.400 --> 29:01.271
Or why on June 14,
a crate of rpgs started
out at 379 pounds

29:01.273 --> 29:03.140
And arrived at 376.

29:04.876 --> 29:06.410
I mean, I can go on.

29:06.412 --> 29:08.746
I've got a list of about
20 just like that
in the last year.

29:08.748 --> 29:10.380
Well, how the fuck
should I know?

29:10.382 --> 29:13.083
Because for the last two
of your almost 20
you were paid to know.

29:13.085 --> 29:14.985
You signed for
every questionable delivery.

29:15.720 --> 29:16.787
I don't need this shit.

29:18.857 --> 29:20.557
You walk out that door,
you're gonna be in cuffs

29:20.559 --> 29:22.392
And sent to
metropolitan correctional

29:22.394 --> 29:25.662
Faster than you can say,
"supplying military weapons
to gang members."

29:27.932 --> 29:29.633
I don't know anything
about any gangs.

29:29.934 --> 29:31.668
Well, you have a lot
of blood on your hands.

29:36.608 --> 29:38.942
You can either talk to me
or you can talk to a judge.

29:39.210 --> 29:41.545
If you talk to me,
maybe you don't
have to talk to a judge.

29:51.790 --> 29:53.891
All I know is that this guy
comes to me

29:53.893 --> 29:55.893
And says that he'll give me
1,000 bucks a shot

29:55.895 --> 29:58.428
If I move the crates that
they marked out of
the bottom of the pile

29:58.430 --> 30:00.164
Before the bosses
make their checks.

30:00.166 --> 30:01.632
Make sure they
don't get opened.

30:02.433 --> 30:03.500
And you didn't ask why?

30:05.336 --> 30:06.403
        A name?

30:07.672 --> 30:09.640
You gotta know
who's paying you.

30:09.642 --> 30:11.208
It was a different guy
almost every time.

30:11.776 --> 30:13.010
There's a guy
driving the truck.

30:16.314 --> 30:18.549
-J. Till shipping?
 -That's it.

30:31.696 --> 30:32.763
    Whaddya got?

30:33.998 --> 30:36.333
Guns were transported by
a private shipping company

30:36.335 --> 30:38.535
And taken somewhere between
dover and chicago.

30:38.537 --> 30:39.970
Well, that narrows it down.

30:39.972 --> 30:42.506
(sighs) the trucking company
was called j. Till shipping.

30:42.508 --> 30:44.107
            So?

30:44.109 --> 30:46.176
So after we cut through
all the corporate
shell game bullshit,

30:46.178 --> 30:48.779
One of the owners
of the crown building
was a jackie till.

30:48.781 --> 30:52.182
The kings were using
the crown building to
launder drug money.

30:52.184 --> 30:55.118
Maybe this jackie till
connects the guns
and the drugs?

30:55.120 --> 30:57.588
I don't know,
maybe she's the brains behind
this whole damn thing.

31:00.024 --> 31:01.191
Fucking patrick.

31:02.327 --> 31:04.061
He was supposed to
get me an address for till.

31:04.362 --> 31:06.363
I swear to god,
sometimes that boy is useless.

31:16.708 --> 31:19.309
No physical address for till
or the shipping company.

31:19.577 --> 31:21.612
Okay, well, you call guthrie.
She'll get you an address.

31:22.680 --> 31:26.283
  And deakins,
you will keep me
informed on this.

31:36.995 --> 31:38.061
        (sighs)

31:40.431 --> 31:41.999
 -Ethan: Did you
set me up, marty?
     -Jesus!

31:42.700 --> 31:44.968
Jesus christ,
you scared the fucking
shit out of me.

31:46.070 --> 31:47.671
Did you set me up, marty?

31:47.673 --> 31:49.373
(stammers) no, I didn't.
Hold on.

31:49.375 --> 31:51.308
I could fucking kill
you right now.

31:52.243 --> 31:53.610
-I didn't set...
     -I...

31:53.612 --> 31:57.047
I just spent three hours in
a federal task force

31:57.049 --> 31:59.950
Being questioned about
weapons that I got
no fucking idea about.

31:59.952 --> 32:02.686
All right, that explains it,
I've been calling you
for the last two...

32:02.688 --> 32:04.554
No, I didn't set you up!

32:04.556 --> 32:08.158
One of marlon's boys rolled
over on the storage locker.
Think for a second!

32:08.359 --> 32:10.193
Why the fuck
would I set you up?

32:10.195 --> 32:11.728
    I need you!

32:11.730 --> 32:14.231
      Two days ago, I got
     out of federal prison
       with a clean slate

32:14.233 --> 32:15.933
And you just put me
back on the radar.

32:15.935 --> 32:17.601
Yes, you and me both.

32:17.603 --> 32:18.669
Why would I do that?

32:19.771 --> 32:21.805
Fucking marlon has
fucked up everything.

32:21.807 --> 32:23.273
I got just a...

32:23.275 --> 32:25.709
All right,
that's my responsibility,
and I am sorry.

32:25.711 --> 32:27.544
I am going to
make this up to you.

32:29.047 --> 32:31.181
-Yes, you will.
    -(sighs)

32:32.450 --> 32:34.818
Why're you running guns to
some lowlife steet gang?

32:34.820 --> 32:37.120
(sighs) they don't get
to keep them.

32:39.891 --> 32:42.125
They're my delivery boys.
They're just a
means to an end.

32:42.127 --> 32:43.360
They were supposed to be.

32:48.399 --> 32:49.466
          Look.

32:50.601 --> 32:52.436
You wanna work with me,
I wanna work with you.

32:52.438 --> 32:54.705
It's time for the big picture.
Let me just ask you something.

32:56.641 --> 32:59.109
Why did you leave
harvard after 9/11?

32:59.111 --> 33:00.377
Why did you sign up?

33:01.479 --> 33:03.013
You already know the answer
to that question.

33:03.015 --> 33:05.349
Just humor me for
half a second, will ya?

33:05.351 --> 33:07.451
You said you wanted all this?

33:07.453 --> 33:08.952
You coulda had
it threefold by now.

33:08.954 --> 33:11.555
You altered the path
of your life, why?

33:12.290 --> 33:14.124
Because I love my country,

33:14.126 --> 33:15.892
And I wanted to save the
people that live in it.

33:16.494 --> 33:18.328
I love my country too.
Maybe too much.

33:18.330 --> 33:20.864
After 9/11, I would've
followed you
to the recruitment tent,

33:20.866 --> 33:22.666
But they don't take
bald guys with paunches.

33:22.668 --> 33:25.502
But lemme ask you this,
where are we now
after all this time?

33:25.504 --> 33:27.671
All the sacrifice.
Your sacrifice.

33:27.673 --> 33:28.939
It's a fuckin' mess!

33:28.941 --> 33:31.041
Iraq, afghanistan,
it's a free for all.

33:31.043 --> 33:33.377
We don't even know
who to support anymore!

33:33.379 --> 33:37.047
Tribal alliances, right,
they bet the roller
with the hot dice.

33:38.049 --> 33:41.218
Butterfly in havana.
It's a fucking
shitstorm over there.

33:41.220 --> 33:44.454
You still haven't answered my
question about the guns in
the streets of chicago.

33:44.456 --> 33:46.790
The guns are not
gonna stay in chicago.

33:47.358 --> 33:51.294
There's a big cyclorama behind
my little game here, ethan.

33:51.296 --> 33:53.597
And big, big money to boot.

33:54.499 --> 33:56.700
This isn't the cold
war anymore baby,
this is the hot one.

33:56.702 --> 34:00.003
You've seen it firsthand.
Fanatics and fundamentalists.

34:00.005 --> 34:02.039
It's a holy war
to end all wars.

34:02.041 --> 34:04.708
From the ayatollah to
bin laden and now
the shit has spread.

34:04.710 --> 34:09.713
Sunnis and shias,
muslims and christians,
persians and arabs,

34:09.715 --> 34:11.214
Jews and everybody else

34:11.216 --> 34:13.216
And they'll be shooting at
each other for the
next 30 years.

34:13.217 --> 34:18.288
It's small arms warfare
from here to eternity
and I want in on that fun.

34:18.723 --> 34:22.324
-So, you're running guns
into a holy war, is that it?
-Yeah, that's right.

34:22.827 --> 34:24.094
The kurds, for now.

34:24.996 --> 34:27.063
 They're fierce
but under-armed.

34:27.065 --> 34:28.931
And, for now,
they're on our side.

34:30.168 --> 34:31.301
Balance of power.

34:32.335 --> 34:33.837
Protects the long game.
Keeps the peace.

34:33.839 --> 34:36.540
Whatever semblance of
peace we can grab onto.

34:36.542 --> 34:37.741
That's my play.

34:37.743 --> 34:40.077
How can I help?
I'm a businessman.

34:40.079 --> 34:42.746
Supply and demand.
Supply the low side
and keep 'em honest.

34:42.748 --> 34:44.447
It's as old as
khrushchev's shoe.

34:44.949 --> 34:46.149
Have you lost your mind?

34:46.417 --> 34:49.186
I certainly fucking hope so,
like thomas paine.

34:50.420 --> 34:52.155
Let me make something
very clear to you, marty.

34:52.889 --> 34:55.692
I'm not interested in your
little charlie wilson war.

34:56.393 --> 34:57.461
        Really?

34:59.063 --> 35:00.130
            Huh.

35:05.303 --> 35:07.270
I don't get it,
money, money, money, money.

35:07.272 --> 35:08.905
Money makes the
world go round.

35:08.907 --> 35:11.374
As has been
said in life and art,

35:11.376 --> 35:13.810
"it's business, sonny,
just business."

35:14.946 --> 35:15.979
I don't like it.

35:15.981 --> 35:17.547
I don't like it either.

35:17.549 --> 35:19.216
But business says otherwise.

35:19.218 --> 35:20.417
You love your country?
 So do I.

35:20.419 --> 35:22.452
Protect our
national interests.

35:22.454 --> 35:26.623
Oil makes the world go round
and bullets are flying
in the jet stream.

35:26.625 --> 35:30.494
Seventy years, we've invested
in saudi arabia, iraq,
kuwait, israel,

35:30.496 --> 35:32.662
Schools, factories, highways.

35:33.297 --> 35:35.031
We've built cities
 out of sand.

35:35.333 --> 35:38.268
We conquered and colonized,
stamped, paid in full.

35:38.270 --> 35:40.003
The global empire, baby.

35:40.005 --> 35:41.304
Love it or leave it.

35:43.074 --> 35:44.741
Okay. Where are the guns?

35:45.643 --> 35:46.710
        (sighs)

35:49.080 --> 35:51.214
The los almas muerto cartel.

35:53.985 --> 35:55.051
Well, good luck with that.

36:02.460 --> 36:04.861
Oh, my god.
Ethan, ethan, ethan.

36:04.863 --> 36:06.396
Man, did I have
you pegged wrong?

36:08.099 --> 36:09.266
        (sighs)

36:09.268 --> 36:10.700
They got me behind
the eight ball.

36:12.970 --> 36:14.037
I want those guns back.

36:14.039 --> 36:15.872
And I can't get
'em without you.

36:17.675 --> 36:19.609
We did this right,
we could've been in business

36:19.611 --> 36:21.378
Until you've got
great grandkids.

36:23.314 --> 36:24.581
What's in it for me, marty?

36:27.985 --> 36:29.052
What are you thinking?

36:30.454 --> 36:32.055
A lotta commas
and a lotta zeros.

36:32.690 --> 36:33.790
I was thinking percentage.

36:34.492 --> 36:36.026
      -Partners?
      -Partners.

36:36.028 --> 36:37.093
  Not partners.

36:38.229 --> 36:40.764
I'm an independent contractor.
Understood?

36:42.133 --> 36:43.200
        (sighs)

36:45.069 --> 36:47.270
Understood.
Commas and zeros it is.

37:06.057 --> 37:07.123
    How's this?

37:10.528 --> 37:11.628
  It's a start.

37:19.904 --> 37:23.240
Harper: Lowry, guthrie gave me
an address for jackie till.

37:23.242 --> 37:24.307
          Um...

37:26.244 --> 37:27.577
It's not making sense.

37:27.579 --> 37:29.446
I'll call you when
I have something.

38:13.791 --> 38:14.891
Right this way.

38:18.329 --> 38:19.396
Jackie, my love.

38:20.131 --> 38:21.364
I've a visitor for you.

38:27.438 --> 38:28.638
Hello, miss till.

38:30.007 --> 38:31.574
I'm harper deakins.

38:33.277 --> 38:35.578
I'd like ask you a few
questions about
the crown building,

38:35.580 --> 38:36.713
If that's okay?

38:39.083 --> 38:41.017
Oh, she's not very talkative.

38:41.019 --> 38:43.286
Although, you should hear her
when we have pancakes.

38:43.288 --> 38:45.288
Blueberry pancakes.

38:45.290 --> 38:46.389
Tomorrow, sweetie.

38:47.758 --> 38:52.028
The dance.
I can't be late.
Teddy doesn't like to wait.

38:53.664 --> 38:56.066
-How long has she been here?
-About two years.

38:57.435 --> 38:59.703
    -Really?
 -Why, is there
something wrong?

38:59.970 --> 39:01.571
She bought a
building last year.

39:02.173 --> 39:04.207
(chuckles) you must have
the wrong jackie till.

39:04.842 --> 39:06.343
  My red dress.

39:06.977 --> 39:09.713
It gets teddy all hot.

39:10.214 --> 39:11.481
Sure it does, sweetie.

39:11.483 --> 39:13.016
Does she ever
get any visitors?

39:13.551 --> 39:15.552
Her son comes by once a week.

39:16.554 --> 39:18.121
Sometimes these help
them remember.

39:20.524 --> 39:22.092
Here. That's him.

39:22.693 --> 39:23.760
    Nice fellah.

39:24.862 --> 39:26.329
 There was also
some skinny guy

39:26.331 --> 39:27.897
Who came by,
wanted to talk to her,

39:27.899 --> 39:29.899
Said he was making a movie.

39:29.901 --> 39:31.067
Pleasant young man.

39:33.237 --> 39:34.437
Adam hutchings?

39:35.139 --> 39:36.973
I don't know,
I don't remember his name.

39:41.679 --> 39:42.746
        Thanks.

39:58.562 --> 40:00.930
-Man: Which one
of you is stein?
-That would be me.

40:01.499 --> 40:04.601
Well, mr. Stein,
you have quite a set
of balls on you.

40:04.603 --> 40:05.969
I do walk with a limp.

40:06.837 --> 40:07.904
      Who's he?

40:07.906 --> 40:09.439
This would be my associate.

40:10.908 --> 40:12.542
You need two people
to ask a question?

40:12.544 --> 40:14.144
You need three to answer one?

40:14.578 --> 40:16.079
      (chuckles)

40:16.081 --> 40:17.747
Shit, you must be
a good lawyer.

40:18.416 --> 40:19.783
The guns marlon gave you...

40:19.785 --> 40:21.251
He didn't give me anything.

40:21.253 --> 40:25.422
The guns marlon
bartered for drugs.
I want them back.

40:25.424 --> 40:27.323
I'll give you the street
value of the drugs.

40:28.559 --> 40:30.660
I already have a lot
of money, mr. Stein.

40:30.961 --> 40:33.029
Well, you wouldn't be here
if you didn't want more.

40:33.031 --> 40:34.164
I'll double the price.

40:34.465 --> 40:35.598
Don't you read?

40:35.600 --> 40:37.600
Money is the root of all evil.

40:37.602 --> 40:40.937
Those guns,
that's something special.

40:42.540 --> 40:45.108
Well, then we have
a little bit a situation here.

40:46.143 --> 40:49.212
You want to keep the guns
and I'm not leaving until
I get them back.

40:49.547 --> 40:51.080
      (chuckles)

40:51.082 --> 40:52.449
That is a situation.

40:54.318 --> 40:57.320
   Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!
 What the fuck?

40:57.988 --> 40:59.622
I thought we could
figure this out like...

40:59.624 --> 41:01.357
You know what?
Go ahead and shoot him.

41:02.460 --> 41:03.626
        (groans)

41:03.628 --> 41:05.228
Let me see your fucking hands!

41:05.230 --> 41:06.296
Let me see 'em!

41:06.664 --> 41:07.730
    (man groans)

41:09.300 --> 41:10.667
Don't you fucking move!

41:17.007 --> 41:18.408
Don't fucking move!

41:23.747 --> 41:26.015
        (sighs)
         now...

41:26.684 --> 41:29.219
Can we negotiate
like proper businessmen?

41:29.987 --> 41:31.688
I can't get you
your drugs back,

41:31.690 --> 41:34.090
Obviously, 'cause they're
already out on the street.

41:34.092 --> 41:35.258
You don't want money.

41:36.994 --> 41:39.429
You just bought yourself
a war with the nastiest
fuckers you'll ever see.

41:39.964 --> 41:41.831
Well, then, maybe we oughta
shoot this piece of shit.

41:42.433 --> 41:44.467
Go ahead, kill me.
You'll be dead by tomorrow.

41:44.469 --> 41:47.270
Can we please stop
acting like eight year olds?

41:49.306 --> 41:52.242
Look, you don't want money,
I can't get you drugs.

41:52.977 --> 41:54.878
But there is something
I can get you,

41:54.880 --> 41:56.946
Something you
cannot get for yourself,

41:56.948 --> 42:00.950
Something you truly
need if you wanna
succeed in america.

42:00.952 --> 42:02.018
And what's that?

42:02.020 --> 42:03.386
A United States senator.

42:05.289 --> 42:07.524
You never know when one
might come in handy,

42:07.958 --> 42:09.325
Especially in
your line of work.

42:09.327 --> 42:11.494
You get a senator,
you get a judge,
you get power.

42:11.496 --> 42:14.030
And then you are
truly protected.

42:14.532 --> 42:15.965
Just like home.

42:16.367 --> 42:17.967
And you can do that?

42:18.369 --> 42:21.037
You know bob richmond?
He's about to become
a us senator

42:21.039 --> 42:23.706
-From the state of illinois.
-Yes, of course.

42:25.743 --> 42:28.077
-(phone rings)
-robert richmond speaking.

42:28.546 --> 42:30.046
         -Bob.
         <i>-Marty.</i>

42:30.048 --> 42:31.714
Bob, how you doing?

42:31.716 --> 42:34.317
I'm good, marty,
polls are up three points
as of this morning.

42:34.319 --> 42:38.755
Well, that's great, bob.
Listen, I am representing
a new interest group.

42:38.757 --> 42:40.323
         <i>Uh huh.</i>

42:40.325 --> 42:42.725
And we would certainly
like to know that
we have your support

42:42.727 --> 42:44.827
When you go to washington.

42:44.829 --> 42:46.362
I'd be glad to help, marty.

42:46.364 --> 42:48.598
Well, that's great, bob,
thank you very much.

42:48.600 --> 42:50.733
Yeah.
Still up for poker Friday?

42:51.435 --> 42:54.771
Yeah, bob, I'm...
I'll see you Friday.

42:56.240 --> 42:57.774
        (sighs)

42:58.442 --> 43:01.244
If I don't deliver on my word,

43:01.445 --> 43:03.813
I'm sure you can
find out where I live.

43:05.082 --> 43:06.816
Do we have a deal?

43:12.790 --> 43:14.524
Sorry about your guy.

43:17.962 --> 43:20.830
About fucking time.
My ass is numb,
I peed onto...

43:23.300 --> 43:24.968
        (grunts)
          god.

43:28.205 --> 43:30.673
Jackie till is your
fucking mother?

43:34.311 --> 43:36.312
Hutchings knew about the guns,

43:36.647 --> 43:37.847
      Didn't he?

43:38.449 --> 43:39.849
That's why he was murdered.

43:40.985 --> 43:42.218
      What guns?

43:42.653 --> 43:45.021
No, do not bullshit
me now, patrick.

43:45.823 --> 43:49.692
Tell me about the
military weapons that you and
your friends were ripping off.

43:49.893 --> 43:51.694
I swear, I don't know any...

43:52.463 --> 43:53.830
          Jesus!

43:55.499 --> 43:57.533
Do not fucking push me.

44:00.404 --> 44:01.938
I'm calling lowry
right fucking now

44:01.940 --> 44:04.574
And I'm telling him
you're in the shit
up to your neck.

44:05.075 --> 44:06.142
(phone ringing)

44:10.514 --> 44:12.315
So, did you find
j. Till shipping?

44:12.983 --> 44:15.151
Yeah, actually, sir,
about that...

44:15.519 --> 44:18.021
-Okay, okay.
-Well, what is it, deakins?
Spit it out.

44:19.356 --> 44:20.923
I gotta call you back.

44:34.538 --> 44:36.339
Tell me everything.

44:40.644 --> 44:41.844
          Fuck.

44:44.548 --> 44:46.683
I don't know,
four, five years ago,

44:46.685 --> 44:49.552
I'm sitting alone
in my cruiser,
two or three in the morning.

44:50.154 --> 44:52.055
This fucking asshole
in a navigator

44:52.057 --> 44:54.524
Flies by on michigan,
doing 120.

44:55.526 --> 44:57.727
Now, normally,
I don't give dick
about speeding tickets.

44:57.729 --> 45:00.530
Probably just some
fucking dude rushing home
to get home to get laid,

45:00.532 --> 45:02.932
But this guy just kinda
fucking pissed me off,
you know?

45:03.300 --> 45:09.138
I mean, the arrogance
of flying by a cruiser
on michigan, doing 120?

45:10.874 --> 45:13.876
So, lights, sirens, the works.

45:13.878 --> 45:17.447
I pull him over,
and I am expecting a fight,
you know how it is.

45:18.882 --> 45:20.216
  But this guy,

45:21.185 --> 45:22.618
      This guy,

45:23.921 --> 45:25.655
He apologizes to me.

45:26.890 --> 45:28.224
Can you believe that?

45:29.727 --> 45:30.960
    No excuses.

45:31.161 --> 45:32.662
No babe in the car.

45:32.896 --> 45:34.097
        Nothing.

45:34.665 --> 45:36.766
He says
he just likes to drive fast.

45:37.101 --> 45:40.803
And he knows michigan,
at 3 a.M., is empty.

45:42.106 --> 45:43.539
I write him a ticket.

45:43.541 --> 45:46.476
He thanks me, he drives off.

45:47.411 --> 45:48.978
      This guy,

45:49.346 --> 45:50.980
    Marty stein.

45:53.584 --> 45:57.520
Two days later,
I get bulls tickets
sent to the station.

45:57.888 --> 46:00.022
Floor fucking seats.

46:00.257 --> 46:02.158
    No strings.

46:02.760 --> 46:06.095
A week after that
he takes me to alinea.

46:06.097 --> 46:08.197
Meal cost two grand.

46:09.366 --> 46:11.400
-Just the two of us.
-What did he want?

46:11.402 --> 46:13.536
Nothing.
We talked hoops all night.

46:13.538 --> 46:15.638
And it goes on and on
like this.

46:15.640 --> 46:18.141
We have a ballgame, a meal,

46:18.143 --> 46:20.843
10th row springsteen tickets,
whatever.

46:21.111 --> 46:22.311
He didn't want anything?

46:22.313 --> 46:24.313
He says he admires
first responders,

46:24.315 --> 46:26.849
And he wants to show
his appreciation.

46:27.651 --> 46:30.186
-And you believed him?
-The guy's a lawyer, deaks.

46:30.554 --> 46:31.821
He's a great one.

46:32.623 --> 46:34.524
He lies for a living.

46:37.294 --> 46:41.297
And a couple months
after that, he calls me
over to his house.

46:41.299 --> 46:43.666
His housekeeper,
she's got these
speeding tickets.

46:43.668 --> 46:46.536
I've done worse
for my cousin brian.
He's an asshole.

46:47.938 --> 46:49.872
Then, a few more months
after that,

46:50.407 --> 46:52.909
It's a Sunday, cubs-dodgers.

46:52.911 --> 46:56.045
We're sitting so close
I can smell the pine tar.

46:57.447 --> 46:59.749
He asked me about
a detective in my precinct.

47:01.585 --> 47:03.252
What kind of guy he is?

47:03.821 --> 47:05.221
  Does he drink?

47:05.489 --> 47:08.024
Does he play around?
Shit, we all do.

47:12.162 --> 47:14.096
After we go for beers,

47:14.598 --> 47:16.199
And I open up to him.

47:18.502 --> 47:20.736
I mean, we're
fucking buddies, right?

47:23.173 --> 47:25.041
I tell him about my mom.

47:25.275 --> 47:26.943
You didn't tell me about her.

47:27.511 --> 47:29.278
She was in the state hospital.

47:30.214 --> 47:32.381
It was like  <i>cuckoo's nest.</i>

47:32.850 --> 47:34.050
          Worse.

47:34.885 --> 47:37.520
They let these people
shit themselves.

47:37.522 --> 47:39.722
They clean it up next Tuesday.

47:41.525 --> 47:43.593
This is my mom, harper.

47:48.665 --> 47:50.800
Marty says, "fuck that."

47:51.034 --> 47:54.871
"I'll take care of it."
next day she is
in this private joint,

47:54.873 --> 47:56.372
Round-the-clock nurses.

47:59.676 --> 48:03.045
So, yeah, maybe
he started asking
for some more, for, like,

48:03.047 --> 48:06.782
Warrants and stuff,
but the guy is paying
my mom's bills.

48:11.555 --> 48:14.390
He's the one that got me
assigned to task force.

48:16.860 --> 48:18.127
          Fuck.

48:19.663 --> 48:22.665
All I had to do was
keep him informed
about the kings.

48:23.400 --> 48:25.134
If we were planning a bust,

48:25.335 --> 48:28.571
-When, where, shit like that.
-Shit like that?

48:28.573 --> 48:30.172
Jesus christ, paddy.

48:31.241 --> 48:32.775
 None of this
ever bothered you?

48:33.076 --> 48:34.443
I didn't think about it.

48:34.878 --> 48:36.512
No, you chose not to.

48:38.048 --> 48:39.482
Did you know about hutchings?

48:41.218 --> 48:43.419
Hutchings stole some file
from marty's firm.

48:43.421 --> 48:45.755
 Marty says,
"go get the file."

48:45.757 --> 48:47.690
You know, clean house,
make sure nothing's there

48:47.692 --> 48:49.959
That attaches
hutchings to marty.

48:52.763 --> 48:54.330
And that's when
you took the camera?

48:55.532 --> 48:58.000
I swear to god, I didn't know
they were gonna kill him.

48:58.468 --> 48:59.835
  Yeah, you did.

49:00.771 --> 49:03.039
You're a detective.
You sure as shit fucking knew,

49:03.041 --> 49:06.142
And then you went around
telling marty stein every
fucking thing I was thinking.

49:07.778 --> 49:10.546
-Only what he asked me.
-Fuck you, patrick.

49:12.149 --> 49:13.683
Did you know about the guns?

49:14.885 --> 49:17.053
I swear on my life,
I swear on my mother's life,

49:17.055 --> 49:18.721
I know nothing about the guns.

49:21.558 --> 49:23.793
I turn you in,
I get marty stein.

49:23.795 --> 49:25.061
            Yup.

49:25.295 --> 49:27.730
You turn me in
and my mom's on the streets.

49:28.298 --> 49:31.200
You turn me in and
I go to jail, and I am dead
within a week.

49:31.835 --> 49:33.703
You know that, deaks.

49:36.306 --> 49:37.707
I'm begging you.

49:38.675 --> 49:40.643
I didn't know shit
about the guns.

49:44.414 --> 49:45.982
It's me, harper.

49:47.484 --> 49:48.718
        Please.

50:22.552 --> 50:24.553
You're going to make
yourself crazy.

50:26.890 --> 50:29.258
That's the real leader
of the 13th street kings.

50:29.526 --> 50:30.860
    Marty stein.

50:31.528 --> 50:33.529
Check that,
you already are crazy.

50:33.531 --> 50:38.734
Marty stein is using the kings
to steal us military weapons
en route to chicago pd.

50:38.736 --> 50:40.536
Adam hutchings found out.

50:40.538 --> 50:43.773
He was about to
blow the whistle,
marty stein had him killed.

50:44.708 --> 50:47.810
There's nothing on that board
directly connecting
marty stein to any of this.

50:48.311 --> 50:51.480
-There's talia.
-Like I said, nothing.

50:51.715 --> 50:54.050
His firm did the closing deal
on the crown building,

50:54.052 --> 50:57.553
They represent marlon dinard
and employ ethan kelly.

50:57.555 --> 51:00.990
Makes for a good story.
Doesn't do shit in court.

51:01.992 --> 51:04.660
What if I could prove
marty stein

51:04.662 --> 51:06.462
Is connected to
j. Till shipping.

51:07.864 --> 51:09.732
Then, maybe,
you have something.

51:10.267 --> 51:11.767
Can you connect them?

51:12.402 --> 51:14.070
          -Yes.
          -How?

51:19.943 --> 51:21.444
        Deakins?

51:22.245 --> 51:23.312
            Sir?

51:24.381 --> 51:26.415
Can you connect stein
to j. Till shipping?

51:30.253 --> 51:31.520
No, sir, not yet.

51:32.689 --> 51:33.923
    Okay, then.

51:35.959 --> 51:38.360
But you wanna take
a shot at marty stein,

51:40.097 --> 51:41.764
You better not miss.

51:43.433 --> 51:45.367
In the meantime, you need to
finish up your paperwork
on jason williams.

52:19.069 --> 52:20.703
  Thirty hours.

52:24.341 --> 52:26.709
Is working with you
always gonna be
this boring?

52:27.744 --> 52:30.045
Only on days ending in "y."

52:45.162 --> 52:46.662
  You all right?

52:46.997 --> 52:48.597
What are you, a shrink now?

52:49.132 --> 52:51.000
I've been called worse.

52:56.106 --> 52:58.240
As hemingway said,

52:59.209 --> 53:02.244
"if it feels good, afterwards,
it's moral."

53:02.679 --> 53:04.747
Well, then we should
be celebrating.

53:05.482 --> 53:07.183
Stein's first rule.

53:07.185 --> 53:09.919
Never celebrate
when someone's pointing
the gun right at your balls.

53:10.687 --> 53:12.121
Who's pointing the gun?

53:13.790 --> 53:16.225
Mr. Marlon dinard.

53:16.560 --> 53:18.060
I thought you guys were tight?

53:19.629 --> 53:22.031
Marlon wouldn't be
the first dog
to bite his master.

53:22.033 --> 53:24.934
He knows way too much
about my business.

53:25.569 --> 53:28.070
Well, keep him happy,
use the marty magic
to get him off.

53:30.307 --> 53:32.408
Maybe that scares me
 even more.

53:33.210 --> 53:34.743
    Why is that?

53:38.882 --> 53:39.982
You know what, fuck it.

53:41.151 --> 53:43.252
We should celebrate.
Let's get the good stuff.

53:43.254 --> 53:44.720
    I did okay.

53:45.055 --> 53:47.056
-We got my guns back.
  -Yeah.

54:07.711 --> 54:08.911
      Thank you.

54:14.951 --> 54:17.353
"a man of the law
belongs to the law,

54:17.587 --> 54:19.822
"and that places him
beyond judgment."

54:21.191 --> 54:22.925
You read my kafka?

54:24.694 --> 54:25.995
That's you, isn't it?

54:27.430 --> 54:29.498
No one is beyond judgment,
I'm afraid.

54:30.100 --> 54:32.368
Yeah, but you been
pretty good at evading it.

54:36.239 --> 54:38.173
So, what are you going to do
with the money I gave you?

54:39.142 --> 54:40.776
You mean, the money I earned?

54:41.778 --> 54:43.712
You still wanna work for me?

54:44.614 --> 54:47.283
I dunno, I was thinking about
starting my own firm.

54:48.618 --> 54:51.186
Maybe getting back into
the intelligence business.

54:52.489 --> 54:53.989
      Who knows,

54:54.324 --> 54:56.058
 Maybe you'd be
my first client?

54:58.628 --> 55:00.329
