What's the deal with this Roan guy?
He's a legend in the department.

00:08.604 --> 00:11.606
<i>An incredible spy. Real

Impossible to
counterfeit, but...

01:22.662 --> 01:24.529
Someone did... perfectly.

01:24.597 --> 01:26.164
It's called a super
note, and I'm in town

01:26.232 --> 01:28.300
to find out who made it.

01:28.367 --> 01:29.467
So you're a spy.

Roan Montgomery.

Hello, Roan. (stammers)

02:00.633 --> 02:02.867
Okay. Here's the sit-rep.

02:02.919 --> 02:04.436
It has been 23 minutes

02:04.503 --> 02:06.371
since Clara had a number one,

02:06.422 --> 02:08.607
51 minutes since number two,

02:08.674 --> 02:09.890
and 76 minutes

02:09.976 --> 02:11.593
since her last feeding.

02:11.677 --> 02:12.560
Maybe she's hungry.

02:12.645 --> 02:13.712
Or maybe she needs a change.

02:13.779 --> 02:15.847
Hey, Sarah, could you
get the diapers and wipes?

02:15.915 --> 02:17.649
Chuck, feeding pillow, stat!

02:17.717 --> 02:18.934
Okay. ELLIE: Mom,

02:19.018 --> 02:20.518
can you take her for a
minute while I get settled?

02:20.569 --> 02:21.720
Yeah. Go to Grandma.

02:21.787 --> 02:23.288
Come to Grandma.

02:23.356 --> 02:25.523
(fussing stops) MARY:
Yeah. That's my girl.

02:25.574 --> 02:27.826
CAPTAIN: Aw, Grandma's got
the magic touch. MARY: Oh...

02:29.762 --> 02:31.229
MARY: Smooth and silent.

02:31.297 --> 02:33.598
Same technique
I always used for

02:33.666 --> 02:36.284
moving live explosives. (coos)

02:36.369 --> 02:37.669
Okay, I'll just
edit that part out.

02:38.638 --> 02:40.639
(quietly) Wow.

02:42.742 --> 02:44.142
Babies are stressful.

02:44.210 --> 02:45.543
Tell me about it.

02:45.611 --> 02:47.879
You know, speaking
of which... Alex...

02:47.947 --> 02:51.099
you know, there's something
I want to... tell you...

02:51.183 --> 02:52.150
talk to you about...

02:52.218 --> 02:53.618
Hold on! Wow!

02:53.686 --> 02:56.154
It's all good... great.
Alex isn't pregnant.

02:56.222 --> 02:58.623
No, no. She just... She
wants me to meet her mom.

02:58.691 --> 03:00.775
Oh. Kathleen. Yeah.

03:00.860 --> 03:02.227
Kathleen. You know,
and the thing is,

03:02.295 --> 03:03.495
I feel kind of uncomfortable

03:03.562 --> 03:05.964
starting off this relationship
with her with this secret

03:06.032 --> 03:10.302
about my friend-slash-
not-dead-ex-fiancée.

03:10.369 --> 03:12.170
Could you touch base
with her, please,

03:12.238 --> 03:13.288
and tell her you're
actually alive?

03:13.372 --> 03:14.806
Not a good idea. Mm-mm.

03:14.874 --> 03:18.376
You know, uh, Alex's having a
tough time with this, you know?

03:18.444 --> 03:19.411
She's been lying to her mom

03:19.462 --> 03:21.329
this whole time, and, uh,

03:21.414 --> 03:23.515
she couldn't even talk to
her when you were in a coma.

03:23.582 --> 03:25.250
You see? So...

03:25.301 --> 03:28.670
(sighs)

03:28.754 --> 03:30.055
I'll think about
it. Yes! Thank you.

03:30.122 --> 03:31.789
Great! Perfect.
You're the man!

03:31.841 --> 03:33.525
Could you do it kind of
quick, though, you know?

03:33.592 --> 03:36.428
Because I just... I had this
dinner planned on Friday...

03:36.479 --> 03:38.096
So, Chuck, Sarah, what are you
guys thinking for the big day?

03:38.164 --> 03:39.764
Oh, it would be so
great if Clara could walk

03:39.832 --> 03:41.166
down the aisle as
your flower girl.

03:41.233 --> 03:44.002
You know, Woodcombs usually
walk at six or seven months,

03:44.070 --> 03:45.470
so you really don't
have to wait that long.

03:45.521 --> 03:47.472
What are your colors
going to be? Oh...

03:47.523 --> 03:48.840
I'm a better gray
than blue, just as a...

03:48.908 --> 03:51.276
I still have my veil,
if you want to borrow it.

03:51.327 --> 03:53.278
I don't... I don't know
that Sarah's a veil girl.

03:53.346 --> 03:55.513
CAPTAIN: Oh, my cousin is
the raddest vegan caterer.

03:55.581 --> 03:56.681
You got to use him.

03:56.749 --> 03:58.817
Honey, the wedding cake
he made Jim was beige.

03:58.884 --> 04:00.985
CAPTAIN: Well, you know what they
say: something old, something new,

04:01.053 --> 04:02.687
something borrowed, something
beige. (imitates buzzer) Wrong.

04:02.755 --> 04:03.888
It's not beige... Wow...

04:03.956 --> 04:06.491
(grumbling indistinctly)
family... intense...

04:06.559 --> 04:07.792
I'm actually sweating.

04:07.860 --> 04:10.195
The last time I sweat,
there was gunfire involved.

04:10.262 --> 04:12.180
Red? Don't use red.
Red is back! Blue...

04:12.264 --> 04:13.465
(arguing indistinctly)

04:13.532 --> 04:14.733
What does that mean? He
doesn't even eat cake!

04:14.800 --> 04:16.901
I hear you. We need a bad guy.

04:16.969 --> 04:18.069
So badly.

04:19.438 --> 04:22.107
Guys... we need a mission.

05:11.392 --> 05:13.393
CASEY: Sorry to
disturb you, General.

05:13.461 --> 05:15.012
No... (clears
throat), not at all.

05:15.096 --> 05:17.014
General, we were
just wondering

05:17.098 --> 05:20.934
if there was anything that you,
or our country, needed, from us.

05:21.002 --> 05:24.021
Preferably far
outside of America.

05:24.105 --> 05:28.542
Actually, I do have a mission,
but it would be off the books.

05:28.610 --> 05:31.645
You would have no support,
and it's extremely dangerous.

05:31.713 --> 05:32.679
We're in! We're in! In!

05:32.747 --> 05:34.414
Then your mission

05:34.482 --> 05:36.683
is to rescue and
return one of our own:

05:36.751 --> 05:39.186
Agent Roan Montgomery.

05:39.254 --> 05:41.688
(screen bleeps)
Roan Montgomery?

05:41.756 --> 05:43.123
You mean the seduction
- master himself?

05:43.191 --> 05:44.124
I love that guy.

05:44.192 --> 05:45.526
What happened?
Was he captured?

05:45.593 --> 05:47.544
He was last seen in
a café in Marrakech.

05:47.629 --> 05:51.365
Uh, General, given
Agent Montgomery's...

05:51.432 --> 05:53.667
proclivities, is it possible

05:53.735 --> 05:56.203
that he perhaps took an
elective trip off the...

05:56.271 --> 05:58.305
<i>No. That is not what happened.</i>

05:58.373 --> 06:02.559
We believe he was investigating
local crime czarina Fatima Tazi.

06:02.644 --> 06:04.578
She is best known for
her private merc army

06:04.646 --> 06:06.914
of female soldiers.

06:06.981 --> 06:09.566
Agent Montgomery, luckily,
has a tracker on him.

06:09.651 --> 06:12.619
It shows that he is in
Fatima's fortress in Marrakech.

06:12.687 --> 06:16.423
Locate him, and bring him
safely back to the United States.

06:16.491 --> 06:19.376
Thank you.

06:19.460 --> 06:20.427
(screen bleeps)

06:20.495 --> 06:23.330
What is going on
with the general?!

06:23.381 --> 06:24.598
She's a hot mess!

06:24.666 --> 06:27.134
Well, General Beckman
and Roan Montgomery

06:27.202 --> 06:28.385
have a bit of a history.

06:28.469 --> 06:31.238
Their romance has been
going on for decades.

06:31.306 --> 06:33.373
Historic events happen
when those two are together.

06:33.441 --> 06:37.060
Berlin '89, Iraq '91...

06:37.145 --> 06:38.278
Florida 2000...

06:38.346 --> 06:40.414
Which is why we
better go get him.

06:42.483 --> 06:46.787
(high heels clacking)

06:46.854 --> 06:49.356
Roan Montgomery.

06:49.407 --> 06:53.110
Did you ever think your
storied life as a spy

06:53.194 --> 06:56.964
would come to an end because
you picked up a girl in a bar?

06:57.031 --> 06:58.582
Well, actually, yes.

06:58.666 --> 07:00.734
That's precisely
how I thought I'd go.

07:01.786 --> 07:03.136
But that's not what happened.

07:03.204 --> 07:05.138
Oh? Mm-mm. No, I'm

07:05.206 --> 07:06.573
exactly where I wanted to be:

07:06.624 --> 07:08.508
in front of the
woman who's created

07:08.576 --> 07:11.511
the world's only flawless
counterfeit bills.

07:12.780 --> 07:15.649
And meeting me was
worth dying for?

07:15.717 --> 07:17.017
You're not going to kill me.

07:17.085 --> 07:19.419
You're going to make me
your head of distribution.

07:19.470 --> 07:22.189
(giggles) No, no,
no. I'm not joking.

07:22.257 --> 07:23.590
My international contacts

07:23.658 --> 07:26.059
can help you launder
your money so that

07:26.110 --> 07:29.029
people like me don't keep
showing up at your door.

07:32.984 --> 07:37.437
And why would I do
business with a CIA pig?

07:37.505 --> 07:39.239
(sniffs) Mmm.

07:39.307 --> 07:42.109
Because rolling
around in the mud

07:42.176 --> 07:45.178
can be so much... fun.

07:55.023 --> 07:57.641
What?

07:57.725 --> 07:59.293
You always over-pack
for missions.

07:59.360 --> 08:01.662
How am I supposed to know what
kind of mission we're going on?

08:01.729 --> 08:03.797
It could be a shooting mission;
it could be a dancing mission.

08:03.865 --> 08:05.816
It could be a shoot-dance,

08:05.900 --> 08:07.267
which I know isn't
really a thing,

08:07.335 --> 08:09.469
but knowing our track record,
is very much a possibility.

08:09.537 --> 08:12.272
Well, let's just save that
for the honeymoon, shall we?

08:12.340 --> 08:15.442
So... your family.

08:15.510 --> 08:16.877
Sorry, sorry.

08:16.944 --> 08:18.812
They're a little intense
about the wedding, huh?

08:18.863 --> 08:20.380
They're very sweet.

08:20.448 --> 08:21.848
But...

08:21.916 --> 08:23.283
But...?

08:23.351 --> 08:26.319
I have a proposition for you.

08:26.371 --> 08:28.021
Okay.

08:28.089 --> 08:29.823
What if we eloped?

08:29.891 --> 08:32.693
I know that you want
the big family wedding,

08:32.760 --> 08:34.828
but your family is
going to be this intense

08:34.895 --> 08:36.897
until we get married, so...

08:36.964 --> 08:39.299
what if we-- just
the two of us--

08:39.366 --> 08:41.134
were to run away to some

08:41.202 --> 08:44.371
beautiful, romantic,
amazing place?

08:44.439 --> 08:46.673
Then all of this
stress and pressure

08:46.741 --> 08:49.076
could be avoided.

08:49.143 --> 08:51.244
Think about it.

08:59.654 --> 09:02.656
Is she trying to kill me?

09:02.724 --> 09:05.359
I know. Elope?

09:05.426 --> 09:06.827
I can't elope.

09:06.894 --> 09:07.994
Of course you can't!

09:08.062 --> 09:09.863
Who's going to
be the best man?

09:09.914 --> 09:10.864
I'll tell you who.

09:10.932 --> 09:12.966
Some weird, creepy cousin

09:13.034 --> 09:15.135
of some weird, old stranger
you find to marry you.

09:15.203 --> 09:16.269
And then his weird, old wife

09:16.337 --> 09:17.571
who smells like
Thousand Island dressing

09:17.638 --> 09:18.572
is going to stand
up for Sarah.

09:18.639 --> 09:19.873
And then you're stuck with

09:19.941 --> 09:21.775
a bunch of weird,
old, stinky strangers

09:21.843 --> 09:22.976
in your wedding photos.

09:23.044 --> 09:24.911
I just got my family
back together, you know?

09:24.979 --> 09:26.646
I have a niece now.

09:26.714 --> 09:29.116
I want them to
be in my wedding.

09:29.183 --> 09:31.318
But you know, marriage
is about compromise,

09:31.385 --> 09:34.688
and this is what Sarah wants.

09:34.756 --> 09:37.074
But you giving Sarah what
she wants and me not getting

09:37.158 --> 09:40.026
what I want is not,
necessarily, "compromise."

09:40.094 --> 09:42.496
The point is-- and I'm sorry to
say this to you, buddy, because

09:42.563 --> 09:45.065
I know you've never been able
to do this with a lady, ever--

09:45.133 --> 09:47.784
but you're going to have
to put your foot down.

09:47.869 --> 09:49.503
Just say no.

09:49.570 --> 09:51.138
No, huh?

09:51.205 --> 09:52.923
To Sarah?

14:41.847 --> 14:43.280
I talked to your father.

14:43.348 --> 14:46.350
And he agreed to get
in touch with your mom.

14:46.418 --> 14:47.985

I'm sorry. I'm
sorry, bad initiative.

15:09.408 --> 15:11.709

15:52.751 --> 15:54.685
No?

15:54.753 --> 15:58.322
Yeah, no. I-I said no because
I think... I think Roan is making

15:58.390 --> 16:00.524
some good headway here and
we should let him finish.

16:00.592 --> 16:01.509

16:02.761 --> 16:04.428
But...

16:04.496 --> 16:06.063
But nothing,
okay? I said no...

16:06.131 --> 16:07.064
woman.

16:07.132 --> 16:09.100
Sometimes in a relationship

16:09.167 --> 16:12.002
people disagree
about things and...

16:18.143 --> 16:19.176
See, see?

16:19.244 --> 16:20.778
Not the worst
spies in the world.

two you were a young,

16:58.917 --> 17:02.386

chasing, flirting.

17:02.454 --> 17:04.622

17:04.689 --> 17:06.156

17:06.223 --> 17:09.993

17:10.060 --> 17:12.061
and soon to be married.

17:12.130 --> 17:14.898

of a disagreement right now,

17:14.965 --> 17:17.401

chain isn't helping.

17:17.452 --> 17:19.252

17:26.211 --> 17:28.295
Ball and chain.
Yes, thank you.

17:28.380 --> 17:31.081
What's with all the
"no's" lately, anyway?

17:31.149 --> 17:35.586
I may have been a
little obstinate before.

17:35.637 --> 17:39.089

is about something bigger.

17:39.157 --> 17:41.025
Performance issues.

17:41.092 --> 17:44.862

More than adequate

I don't want to elope.

17:49.668 --> 17:51.502

don't. Not at all.

17:51.570 --> 17:53.370
Not even in the slightest bit.

17:53.438 --> 17:54.822
I've always wanted
a big family wedding,

17:54.906 --> 17:57.808
and now more than ever, so no.

17:57.876 --> 17:59.977
My answer to eloping is no.

18:00.045 --> 18:02.313
Okay, fine. I hear
what you're saying.

18:02.380 --> 18:05.499
But why do you get to say no?

18:05.584 --> 18:08.118
What about what I want?

18:08.186 --> 18:11.155
(sighs)

18:34.279 --> 18:36.647
Okay, I've got eyeballs
on the dungeon door,

18:36.698 --> 18:38.699
and there is a lady guard.

18:38.783 --> 18:40.918
I'm gonna seduce
my way past her.

18:40.986 --> 18:43.020
Oh, no. Uh-oh.

18:43.088 --> 18:44.255
What? What's happening?

18:44.322 --> 18:46.590
Casey's gonna try
and seduce the guard.

18:46.658 --> 18:50.094
No! What? The man who flunked
my course at the farm twice?!

18:50.161 --> 18:51.795
Casey, that's not
a very good idea.

18:51.863 --> 18:53.764
Don't you have a gun
or some explosives?

18:53.832 --> 18:55.266
Yeah, because you're
terrible at seduction.

18:55.333 --> 18:56.400
You have no finesse!

18:56.468 --> 18:58.218
I heard that.

18:58.303 --> 19:00.554
Blowing the door will only
alert the other guards.

19:00.639 --> 19:03.524
Now, this is exactly the type
of girl I know how to charm.

19:03.608 --> 19:05.242
Oh, God, he's gonna charm her.

19:05.310 --> 19:07.177
Look, tranq and explode!

19:07.245 --> 19:09.413
Casey, tranq and explode!

19:10.899 --> 19:12.216
Evening.

19:12.284 --> 19:13.651
Stop!

19:15.186 --> 19:16.453
Well...

19:16.521 --> 19:18.656
That's a lovely
weapon you have there.

19:20.191 --> 19:21.659
Go.

19:23.962 --> 19:27.631
Gosh, it must get awfully
lonely down here in the dungeon

19:27.699 --> 19:31.135
by yourself, no
one to talk to.

19:32.404 --> 19:35.556
Yes. Yes, it does.

19:35.640 --> 19:37.975
Cold, too.

19:38.042 --> 19:40.044
You can take it.

19:40.111 --> 19:41.878
You're hearty.

19:41.930 --> 19:44.148
I can see why
they didn't assign

19:44.215 --> 19:46.767
one of those skinny
ones down here.

19:46.851 --> 19:47.718
(groans)

19:47.769 --> 19:48.485
Don't tell me.

20:06.504 --> 20:08.072

20:08.139 --> 20:10.174

20:13.244 --> 20:14.795
Okay, let's get out of here.

20:14.879 --> 20:16.013
I'm staying here. What? Why?

20:16.081 --> 20:17.381
I told Beckman about
Montgomery's leads.

20:17.432 --> 20:18.966
I'm gonna get to the
bottom of these super notes.

20:19.050 --> 20:19.983
Get him back to Burbank.

20:20.051 --> 20:21.969
Oh, yes, about that,

20:22.053 --> 20:24.321
I'm not going back to
the States with you.

20:24.389 --> 20:26.473
Thanks, all the same.
This has been a debacle.

20:26.558 --> 20:28.642
No, Roan, we need to
take you back with us.

might try that.

20:34.199 --> 20:35.466
Tell Morgan I'll be back

20:35.533 --> 20:37.368
in a week or two. See ya.

20:52.033 --> 20:53.667
Okay, well,
mission accomplished..

20:53.735 --> 20:55.035
Sarah and I will go upstairs

20:55.086 --> 20:56.420
and let you guys catch up.

Sit... down!

20:59.507 --> 21:00.924
Sitting down, ma'am.

21:01.009 --> 21:02.409
Agent Montgomery,

21:02.477 --> 21:04.912
your mission to Morocco,

21:04.979 --> 21:06.129
who ordered you to go?

21:06.214 --> 21:07.648
Well...

21:07.715 --> 21:09.349
No one did!

21:09.417 --> 21:12.302
Fatima Tazi, the super notes?

21:12.387 --> 21:14.588
You went after them
without any authorization,

21:14.656 --> 21:17.491
and now I have one of
my best agents hidden

21:17.559 --> 21:20.277
inside a Moroccan
fortress without backup!

21:22.096 --> 21:23.297
Be on standby.

21:23.364 --> 21:25.132
If Colonel Casey gets
into trouble in Morocco,

21:25.200 --> 21:27.334
I am sending you
in to get him out.

21:27.402 --> 21:28.068

General...

21:32.807 --> 21:35.609

I'll get Casey out.

21:35.677 --> 21:38.812
No. You're done, Roan.

22:05.323 --> 22:07.807
Right. Sorry.

So, how's, uh, how's
everything going?

an intimate relation,

I'm trapped.

30:19.333 --> 30:20.850
I may have to cut my arm off.

30:20.935 --> 30:23.870
Hold on that, Colonel Casey.

30:23.938 --> 30:26.172
Stand by for
further instructions.

30:27.324 --> 30:28.575
You're going to Morocco.

30:28.642 --> 30:29.776
We need the
location of that mint

30:29.844 --> 30:31.244
so we can destroy it.

30:31.312 --> 30:32.612
Yeah, and even more than
that, we've got to get to Casey

30:32.680 --> 30:34.047
before he chops
his own arm off.

30:34.115 --> 30:36.282
General, how are we going to
find the location of the mint?

30:36.350 --> 30:37.684
Fatima isn't going
to tell us anything.

30:37.752 --> 30:40.720
Only one man could possibly
get the information out of her.

Ma'am, Fatima will
have Roan shot on sight.

30:44.759 --> 30:47.160
No man could seduce Fatima
Tazi twice. It's a...

30:47.228 --> 30:48.528
Seduction impossible.

30:48.596 --> 30:50.380
Get him.

30:50.464 --> 30:54.384
General, I know that Roan
has broken a promise or two,

30:54.468 --> 30:56.636
but you can't send the
man to his own death.

30:56.704 --> 30:59.005
Get me Roan Montgomery!

31:07.619 --> 31:13.541
And that is the story
of Sleeping Beauty.

31:15.994 --> 31:18.196
You know, Grandma

31:18.263 --> 31:22.032
once had to take a
potion that made me sleep

31:22.084 --> 31:23.584
for a couple of days.

31:23.669 --> 31:27.088
But Grandma's partner
had a potion, too.

31:27.172 --> 31:29.741
And when it was
time to wake me up,

31:29.808 --> 31:33.061
he put the
antidote on his lips

31:33.128 --> 31:35.713
and woke me with a kiss,

31:35.764 --> 31:38.182
just like the prince.

31:38.250 --> 31:41.219
Grandma was on a mission.

31:41.286 --> 31:43.221
Can you say "mission"?

31:45.190 --> 31:47.258
A seduction? No problem.
But a rope climb?

31:47.326 --> 31:49.093
I am getting a
little old for this.

31:49.161 --> 31:50.411
Okay, climb over.
Get to the boudoir,

31:50.496 --> 31:51.696
and seduce the
location of the mint

31:51.747 --> 31:53.197
out of Fatima.
We'll get Casey.

31:53.265 --> 31:54.766
BECKMAN (over comm): Once we
have the location of the mint,

31:54.833 --> 31:56.234
our attack drones
will take it out.

Move out.

31:57.336 --> 31:59.036

31:59.104 --> 32:00.088
Hey, hey.

32:00.172 --> 32:01.756
One last thing.

two crazy kids again,

32:04.176 --> 32:05.309

32:05.377 --> 32:07.178
Remember you're in love.

32:07.246 --> 32:08.413
Listen to each other.

Never go on a mission angry.

Please,

32:31.804 --> 32:33.788
don't call out for help.

32:35.174 --> 32:37.141
I had to come back
to you, my love.

32:37.209 --> 32:38.543
What are you doing here?

32:41.713 --> 32:43.247
Just hear me out, please.

32:43.298 --> 32:45.249
I'm not here as a spy.

32:45.317 --> 32:46.851
I'm here because of you.

32:46.919 --> 32:48.820
I never wanted to leave you.

32:48.887 --> 32:50.688
I was extracted because
of another woman.

32:50.756 --> 32:52.757
Another woman?

32:54.393 --> 32:56.310
Who?

32:56.395 --> 32:58.996
My general.

32:59.064 --> 33:00.097
Who is impatient.

33:00.165 --> 33:02.016
Get the location
of the mint, Roan.

33:02.100 --> 33:03.184
(sighs)

33:03.268 --> 33:05.019
All this interpersonal
stuff on a mission?

33:05.103 --> 33:06.204
It's very unprofessional.

33:06.271 --> 33:07.355
I know!

33:07.439 --> 33:08.606
I don't want to fight.

33:08.657 --> 33:10.307
Me, neither.

33:12.411 --> 33:14.311
Okay, well, look, we know

33:14.363 --> 33:16.180
my family's stressful,
but what else?

33:16.248 --> 33:18.449
What, uh, you know,
other pros and cons

33:18.517 --> 33:19.817
of having a big wedding?

33:19.885 --> 33:20.918
Well, okay, I mean,

33:20.986 --> 33:22.420
who am I gonna invite?

33:22.487 --> 33:23.621
Who's gonna come?

33:23.672 --> 33:25.540
Who's gonna walk
me down the aisle?

33:25.624 --> 33:27.458
(sighs)

33:27.526 --> 33:28.659
I'm such an idiot.

33:28.710 --> 33:30.294
This was never
about my family.

33:30.345 --> 33:31.546
This is about yours.

33:31.630 --> 33:33.514
I'm so sorry. I should
have figured that out.

33:33.599 --> 33:36.133
I should have told you and
not had you figure it out.

33:36.201 --> 33:38.002
CASEY: You have got to be
kidding me with this conversation.

33:38.070 --> 33:39.303
I am about to cut my arm off.

33:39.371 --> 33:40.338
Casey, hey. Yes.

33:40.405 --> 33:41.939
Good. Sorry. We're right here.

33:50.199 --> 33:52.984
Darling, I know you're
not after wealth.

33:53.051 --> 33:56.988
Your heart is far
too pure for that.

33:57.039 --> 33:58.389
What is it you want?

33:58.457 --> 34:00.374
Why don't you tell me?

34:00.459 --> 34:02.193
Let me help you.

34:13.388 --> 34:16.072
When I was a girl,

34:16.141 --> 34:18.943
my village was destroyed

34:19.011 --> 34:20.511
by an American conglomerate.

34:20.579 --> 34:22.413
(laser crackling)

34:22.481 --> 34:24.614
They strip-mined
over my entire world.

34:24.683 --> 34:25.750
(sighs)

34:25.817 --> 34:28.351
So I am going to
flood the markets

34:28.420 --> 34:30.487
with one trillion
U.S. dollars.

34:30.556 --> 34:32.456
The American economy
will collapse,

34:32.524 --> 34:35.560
and it will be my little
village that brought them down.

34:35.627 --> 34:36.827
Hmm.

34:36.895 --> 34:38.663
Yes, you told me
about your village.

34:38.730 --> 34:41.081
It's called... Setouan.

34:41.166 --> 34:42.366
Is that right?

34:42.434 --> 34:45.101
Yes. You listened.

34:45.170 --> 34:47.103
Of course.

34:47.172 --> 34:49.407
I'd love to visit it someday.

34:51.143 --> 34:52.777
Hmm.

34:56.315 --> 34:58.249
I've got the village
on my monitor.

34:58.317 --> 34:59.951
(computer trilling)

35:00.018 --> 35:01.285
There's the mint.

35:01.353 --> 35:02.753
We got it!

35:02.821 --> 35:05.656
This is Beckman,
authorization 8485-Charlie.

35:05.724 --> 35:08.225
Initiate air strike,
sending grid coordinates now.

35:08.277 --> 35:09.944
MAN: Air strike...
Chuck, Sarah,

35:10.028 --> 35:11.095
get Casey out of there.

35:11.163 --> 35:13.614
We just need a minute.

35:15.984 --> 35:18.502
Uh, General, we're gonna
be slightly delayed.

35:18.570 --> 35:19.570
Chuck, what's happening?

35:19.638 --> 35:22.039
Bad guys. Lots of bad guys.

35:23.825 --> 35:26.510
(soft grunt)

35:30.582 --> 35:32.583
Right behind you.

35:35.887 --> 35:37.355
Take one step to the left.

35:38.824 --> 35:40.124
The other left, idiot.

35:41.343 --> 35:42.193
Don't move!

35:42.260 --> 35:43.928
Never done this before.

35:43.996 --> 35:45.596
What? Never done what before?

35:45.664 --> 35:47.999
WOMAN: There are
Americans in the palace.

35:48.066 --> 35:50.467
You... bastard!

35:50.519 --> 35:52.670
Yes, I answer to that.

35:52.738 --> 35:55.106
WOMAN: What do we do?

35:55.157 --> 35:57.174
Kill them.

Casey, you are great!

36:12.958 --> 36:14.792
(coughing) Get me out of here!

36:14.860 --> 36:16.227
Right. Right.

36:17.379 --> 36:19.063
Now to deal with you, Roan.

36:19.131 --> 36:20.348
(phone ringing)

36:20.432 --> 36:21.832
So sorry.

36:22.801 --> 36:24.385
Oh. So rude.

36:24.469 --> 36:27.138
Hi. Could I call you
right back? I'm right...

36:27.189 --> 36:28.305
Who is this?

36:28.357 --> 36:30.274
This is General Diane Beckman.

36:30.342 --> 36:31.742
With whom am I speaking?

36:31.810 --> 36:34.578
This is the woman who is
about to kill your agent.

36:34.646 --> 36:36.564
Good. It's about time.

36:36.648 --> 36:37.615
Good?

36:38.517 --> 36:40.351
She said, "Good."

36:40.419 --> 36:43.521
We're in the middle of a tiff.

36:43.588 --> 36:45.089
I don't want to stop you.

36:45.157 --> 36:47.692
I'd just like to say
one last thing to Roan.

36:47.759 --> 36:49.927
I'm happy to see him die.

36:49.995 --> 36:51.495
(laughing)

36:51.563 --> 36:53.898
Another one of your admirers.

36:55.667 --> 36:57.935
Hello. Diane, listen,
I just want to say

36:58.003 --> 36:59.437
that I am truly
sorry, but, you know,

36:59.504 --> 37:01.072
I can be such a bastard.

37:01.139 --> 37:02.740
Thank you, Roan.

Oh, one more thing.

Almost like you
rehearsed that.

I made Chuck quit the CIA,

40:07.918 --> 40:11.437
and sometimes I wonder if
that was the right decision,

40:11.522 --> 40:14.190
because I know that
he's a good person

40:14.258 --> 40:16.826
who's helped people,
and he's protected us.

40:18.529 --> 40:20.797
He's a Bartowski.

40:20.864 --> 40:22.799

If you need to be a spy,
that's not another abandonment.

40:36.780 --> 40:39.549
You'll still be in our lives.

40:39.617 --> 40:41.851
I want to give
everything to this baby

40:46.857 --> 40:49.359
