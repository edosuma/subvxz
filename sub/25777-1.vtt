00:34.883 --> 00:35.982
First off I'd like
to thank everyone

00:35.984 --> 00:37.616
for coming out tonight.

00:37.618 --> 00:40.586
Before the festivities begin.

00:42.825 --> 00:44.857
Tonight marks the
official return

00:44.859 --> 00:47.927
of the Annual
Harvest Hootenanny.

00:50.665 --> 00:52.597
And as a token of
our appreciation

00:52.599 --> 00:54.867
we offer tonight's,
uh, celebration

00:54.869 --> 00:57.970
of our way to praise the
Lord for all He's done for us

00:57.972 --> 00:59.171
and all He continues to do

00:59.173 --> 01:02.274
for our little town
of Wheary Falls.

01:04.611 --> 01:06.879
Now as a reminder to all
your trick or treaters

01:06.881 --> 01:10.615
Wheary Farms property
if off limits tonight.

01:10.617 --> 01:13.852
There'll be no adults
there handing out candy.

01:13.854 --> 01:17.355
You'll find plenty of
that right here in town.

01:17.357 --> 01:20.792
Now I want you all
to have fun, be safe

01:20.794 --> 01:24.964
and most all remember the
rules that we discussed.

01:26.966 --> 01:29.666
Now let's all head on
up to the school house

01:29.668 --> 01:31.971
and let the celebration begin!

02:09.907 --> 02:11.640
Well, you heard the preacher,

02:11.642 --> 02:14.242
he said the barn is
off limits tonight.

02:14.244 --> 02:16.912
What are you chicken?

02:16.914 --> 02:18.313
Is Georgie boy afraid

02:18.315 --> 02:21.048
he might see the
Boogeyman or something?

02:21.050 --> 02:22.683
I'm not chicken.

02:22.685 --> 02:25.987
We just shouldn't be
up here by ourselves.

02:25.989 --> 02:28.089
Well what do you know?

02:28.091 --> 02:31.627
There's a jack-o-lantern
waiting for us.

02:36.199 --> 02:37.898
Okay so?

02:37.900 --> 02:39.834
Preacher said
remember the rules.

02:39.836 --> 02:41.268
Every house handing out candy

02:41.270 --> 02:43.937
has a lit jack-o-lantern
outside the door,

02:43.939 --> 02:46.039
watching and waiting.

02:49.711 --> 02:52.445
So there must be candy in there.

02:52.447 --> 02:54.747
Come on Shirley, let's
just go back to town.

02:54.749 --> 02:57.283
We're gonna miss out
on all the good stuff.

02:57.285 --> 02:59.918
But what if there's
special candy in there?

02:59.920 --> 03:02.921
And we're the only ones brave
enough to come and get it.

03:07.729 --> 03:11.665
Trick or treat, trick or
treat, trick or treat.

03:26.213 --> 03:29.216
Trick or treat,
smell by feet, give.

05:53.186 --> 05:55.487
Happy Halloween.

05:55.489 --> 05:58.291
Come
on kids, let's go.

06:01.127 --> 06:04.194
And so every
year on Halloween,

06:04.196 --> 06:07.264
the legend of the barn
tells how's evil's released.

06:07.266 --> 06:09.400
It takes the form
of three demons

06:09.402 --> 06:13.403
dressed as trick or
treaters with evil grins.

06:13.405 --> 06:16.373
The Boogeyman wants
to crack your back

06:16.375 --> 06:20.143
and cut you into pieces
to carry in his sack.

06:20.145 --> 06:24.180
The pumpkin man Hallow Jack
wants to carve out your head

06:24.182 --> 06:27.617
and slash you with his
vines until you're dead.

06:27.619 --> 06:30.219
And if you get
scared, don't you cry.

06:30.221 --> 06:35.191
Or the Candy Corn Scarecrow
will surely eat your eyes.

06:35.193 --> 06:37.192
Three knocks on their
door shall set them free

06:37.194 --> 06:40.931
and only if you say the
words trick or treat.

06:42.567 --> 06:45.434
Oh, spooky costumes kids.

06:45.436 --> 06:47.536
Have fun tonight.

06:47.538 --> 06:49.404
Hey where are my treats?

06:49.406 --> 06:51.106
Where's your costume?

06:51.108 --> 06:52.239
Whatever, pumpkins are
lame and so's your story.

06:52.241 --> 06:55.910
Hey whoa, whoa, whoa,
look my bowls empty alright.

06:55.912 --> 06:57.044
There's more treats in
that barrel over there,

06:57.046 --> 07:00.648
why don't you go grab one
from the bottom alright.

07:10.526 --> 07:11.361
Hey.

07:12.562 --> 07:13.427
Hey!

07:13.429 --> 07:14.964
Happy Halloween.

07:18.166 --> 07:19.366
Damn Sam.

07:19.368 --> 07:22.068
You think you could've found
me a tighter pair of shorts.

07:22.070 --> 07:24.104
I mean, I'm gonna have to do
a cavity search for my balls.

07:24.106 --> 07:25.638
Oh man, they're
not that tight.

07:25.640 --> 07:27.207
I still don't get why we
have to scare all the kids

07:27.209 --> 07:30.076
that aren't dressed
like something spooky.

07:30.078 --> 07:33.245
It's because it's
the costume rule Josh.

07:33.247 --> 07:35.214
The whole point of
dressing scary is to fool

07:35.216 --> 07:38.184
whatever's out there into
believing we're one of them.

07:38.186 --> 07:39.651
Trust me.

07:39.653 --> 07:42.654
That kid now knows to dress
scary if he wants candy.

07:42.656 --> 07:44.256
He learned an
important lesson today.

07:44.258 --> 07:45.190
What?

07:45.192 --> 07:46.258
That older kids are dicks.

07:46.260 --> 07:47.460
Probably.

07:47.462 --> 07:50.061
You never know man, maybe
one day it'll save our lives.

07:50.063 --> 07:51.196
If we're ever in a situation

07:51.198 --> 07:53.665
where we need your Halloween
rules to save our lives,

07:53.667 --> 07:55.500
then we're in a
shit ton of trouble.

07:55.502 --> 07:57.101
Why don't you just
get back in your barrel

07:57.103 --> 07:59.237
before another group comes.

07:59.239 --> 08:00.372
Oh, did you hear that?

08:00.374 --> 08:02.307
Another group's coming.

08:02.309 --> 08:03.144
Great.

08:15.455 --> 08:16.623
Mr. Daniels.

08:17.990 --> 08:21.360
I see you're terrifying
the children again.

08:25.330 --> 08:29.033
Trick or treat to
you too Miss Barnhart.

08:40.278 --> 08:43.413
I believe you were
told last Halloween

08:43.414 --> 08:47.585
to stop scaring the children
with your barn tales.

08:49.253 --> 08:51.654
Yes I was asked to stop
scaring them next Halloween.

08:51.656 --> 08:54.122
Seeing as how it's October 30th,

08:54.124 --> 08:57.259
technically it's not Halloween.

08:57.261 --> 08:58.095
Oh.

09:01.631 --> 09:03.364
Very funny Mr. Daniels.

09:03.366 --> 09:05.033
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

09:08.638 --> 09:11.374
Now I think you'd
go much further

09:12.809 --> 09:17.346
if you'd just stop with the
excuses and just act your age.

09:22.051 --> 09:22.717
You know what?

09:22.719 --> 09:24.418
I will make you a deal.

09:24.420 --> 09:27.321
I promise to stop scaring
kids with my barn story

09:27.323 --> 09:31.325
if you promise to help me
clean this up and put it away.

09:31.327 --> 09:32.361
Really?

09:34.797 --> 09:37.264
Indeed Mr. Daniels.

09:37.266 --> 09:38.732
It all goes in that
barrel right over there.

09:38.734 --> 09:39.565
That barrel?

09:39.567 --> 09:40.433
Yep.

09:40.435 --> 09:41.069
Okay.

09:43.471 --> 09:45.238
Oh by the way Miss Barnhart.

09:45.240 --> 09:46.607
Yes.

09:46.609 --> 09:48.309
Happy Halloween.

10:00.288 --> 10:03.191
Joshua Harper,
you of all people.

10:04.157 --> 10:05.792
The son of our pastor.

10:06.660 --> 10:10.095
To be celebrating Devil's Night,

10:10.097 --> 10:14.131
what would father
think if he were alive?

10:14.133 --> 10:15.333
If my father was still alive

10:15.335 --> 10:19.672
you wouldn't be trying to
fill his shoes in his Church.

10:26.680 --> 10:29.146
I hope you enjoyed yourself.

10:29.148 --> 10:30.447
Thanks to you two,

10:30.449 --> 10:34.487
Helen's Valley will not
see another Halloween.

10:37.490 --> 10:39.358
And I'll make sure of it.

10:45.130 --> 10:47.564
Thank you for covering
my ass back there.

10:47.566 --> 10:49.365
Do you believe this woman?

10:49.367 --> 10:51.401
It's literally been a
year since my dad died

10:51.403 --> 10:53.236
and she thinks because
she runs his Church

10:53.238 --> 10:55.305
she runs this town.

10:55.307 --> 10:57.340
As long as she's in charge,
I'll never be seen at Church.

10:57.342 --> 10:58.508
Yeah.

10:58.510 --> 10:59.842
And who is she to tell us

10:59.844 --> 11:02.210
that we're too old
to trick or treat?

11:02.212 --> 11:02.847
What?

11:04.148 --> 11:06.416
Oh dude, did you hear that?

11:06.418 --> 11:09.484
I think my dad's home early.

11:13.223 --> 11:15.356
Yep, you got all
this for a minute?

11:15.358 --> 11:16.792
I'm gonna go inside and grab
some garbage bags and stuff.

11:16.794 --> 11:18.460
Sounds good partner.

11:18.462 --> 11:22.431
Yeah, I'm gonna go get
changed before we head out.

11:22.433 --> 11:23.531
Yet again

11:23.533 --> 11:28.336
I am sorry to hear about
all of that Miss Barnhart.

11:28.338 --> 11:31.706
Well if that's what he has
to do to make up to you,

11:31.708 --> 11:33.710
I'll tell him right now.

11:34.611 --> 11:36.379
Yeah, sounds great.

11:37.447 --> 11:38.615
Okay, goodbye.

11:43.285 --> 11:46.255
You want to explain
that phone call?

11:47.856 --> 11:50.390
Dad, she broke the rule.

11:50.392 --> 11:52.425
She never said trick or treat.

11:52.427 --> 11:53.462
Dammit Sam.

11:55.429 --> 11:59.432
For someone who is so bent
on the rules for Halloween

11:59.434 --> 12:01.468
you sure as hell seem lacking

12:01.470 --> 12:03.872
in the rules of responsibility.

12:05.206 --> 12:07.272
Do you realize that
in seven months

12:07.274 --> 12:09.943
you graduate high school?

12:09.945 --> 12:12.244
What does that have to
do with a stupid prank?

12:12.246 --> 12:14.513
Do you really want
your legacy in this town

12:14.515 --> 12:17.516
to be the kid who was
so obsessed with himself

12:17.518 --> 12:22.253
and Halloween that he
didn't know when to grow up.

12:22.255 --> 12:24.255
I thought that when
you and your buddies,

12:24.257 --> 12:28.292
the, uh, Gardeners From
Hell began mowing lawns.

12:28.294 --> 12:31.262
That you were growing
out of your kid phase.

12:31.264 --> 12:35.265
But, low and behold,
when the leaves change

12:35.267 --> 12:36.903
so do your priorities.

12:38.838 --> 12:41.372
You don't get it dude.

12:41.374 --> 12:43.440
I didn't choose to
stop being a kid.

12:43.442 --> 12:48.448
You and everyone else in this
town decided that for me.

12:49.683 --> 12:51.850
Well then, this is
your lucky day pal.

12:53.552 --> 12:57.320
Miss Barnhart knows how much
you enjoy acting like a kid

12:57.322 --> 12:59.923
so that's why she's
giving you the experience

12:59.925 --> 13:04.761
of going door to door and
collecting goods tomorrow night

13:04.763 --> 13:07.463
for the Church's food bank.

13:07.465 --> 13:11.768
Oh and uh, by the way,
enjoy yourself tonight.

16:19.314 --> 16:22.983
Always a pleasure, always
a pleasure to see you guys.

16:22.985 --> 16:25.452
You gotta tell us what
is this big announcement

16:25.454 --> 16:29.155
that you came out here on
the Rock Block with Dr. Rock

16:29.157 --> 16:30.724
to tell the world?

16:30.726 --> 16:31.725
Well Doctor.

16:31.727 --> 16:35.127
Tomorrow night, on
Halloween, me and the boys

16:35.129 --> 16:38.965
are gonna be playing a
special show at 11:59 p.m..

16:38.967 --> 16:42.035
So all you kids need to be
there and rock 'n' roll.

16:42.037 --> 16:43.468
Rock 'n' roll that's right.

16:43.470 --> 16:46.071
You heard it hear first
on the Rock Block.

16:46.073 --> 16:48.007
So if you headbangers
wanna get out there

16:48.009 --> 16:49.708
and rock with Demon
Inferno just...

16:49.710 --> 16:54.514
Now that would be a bitching
last Halloween together.

17:02.822 --> 17:04.856
What are you doing?

17:04.858 --> 17:07.723
Listen, we wanna see
this band live right.

17:07.726 --> 17:08.859
Yeah.

17:08.862 --> 17:10.762
And we have to go trick
or treating for Barnhart.

17:10.763 --> 17:14.998
So, why don't we kill
two birds with one stone.

17:15.000 --> 17:15.834
How?

17:18.038 --> 17:20.872
We take a car, drive
towards the concert.

17:20.874 --> 17:23.773
Stop by some town on
the way, trick or treat.

17:23.776 --> 17:26.609
Barnhart didn't say that
the goods couldn't be candy.

17:26.612 --> 17:29.579
It's the ultimate screw you
to her from the both of us.

17:29.581 --> 17:31.781
Yeah, but what about your dad?

17:31.783 --> 17:33.216
Listen, he said
it himself okay.

17:33.218 --> 17:35.551
Once school ends then
everything changes.

17:35.553 --> 17:36.519
Look at this opportunity.

17:36.521 --> 17:39.789
A Demon Inferno concert
and trick or treating.

17:39.791 --> 17:44.796
This could be the night that
makes us legends in this town.

17:45.596 --> 17:46.497
One last hurrah.

17:47.832 --> 17:49.533
One last hurrah.

17:50.568 --> 17:52.937
Well, um, Sam was just saying

17:54.772 --> 17:57.772
how he'd like to see Demon
Inferno tomorrow night

17:57.774 --> 18:01.913
and I was wondering if
y'all liked to tag along.

18:02.980 --> 18:04.514
One last hurrah.

18:05.615 --> 18:06.815
Me, seriously?

18:06.817 --> 18:08.883
Going to see Billy
Michaels live?

18:08.885 --> 18:10.652
My shift ends in 15, we'll talk.

18:10.654 --> 18:11.554
Thanks Sam.

18:15.926 --> 18:16.760
What?

18:18.695 --> 18:21.264
So, how do we
score a ride there?

18:22.932 --> 18:25.934
♪ Going to Long Beach

18:25.936 --> 18:29.705
♪ To get ourselves a treat

18:36.212 --> 18:39.115
Look.

18:41.817 --> 18:45.151
Alright so Chris,
I was thinking.

18:45.153 --> 18:48.021
Tomorrow being our one month
anniversary and everything

18:48.023 --> 18:50.757
maybe we could do
something special.

18:50.759 --> 18:53.592
Something other than hiding
from everyone at the drive-in.

18:53.594 --> 18:56.195
Nikki babe, we'll go do
something special soon.

18:56.197 --> 18:57.032
I promise.

18:58.832 --> 19:00.333
Okay.

19:00.335 --> 19:03.970
So is there anything you
had planned for me tonight?

19:03.972 --> 19:07.307
Uh well, you mean
something like this?

19:14.349 --> 19:15.813
I might say that's something.

19:22.189 --> 19:23.022
Okay.

19:37.303 --> 19:38.202
Oh!

19:39.171 --> 19:41.938
Oh Nikki's ta-ta tittys.

19:41.940 --> 19:43.274
Ah yeah.

19:43.276 --> 19:44.707
What the hells guys?

19:44.709 --> 19:46.277
I was just getting
to second base.

19:46.279 --> 19:47.710
Yeah you were.

19:47.712 --> 19:49.746
Hey listen, can
we borrow your van?

19:49.748 --> 19:50.980
What?

19:50.982 --> 19:52.316
Got another lawn
gate or something?

19:52.318 --> 19:53.716
You know half your
shits still in the back

19:53.718 --> 19:54.983
taking up space from last time.

19:54.985 --> 19:56.953
No, no, no, it's not
a job but we'll pay you.

19:56.955 --> 19:59.355
You still owe
me from last time man.

19:59.357 --> 20:00.857
Demon Inferno just rescheduled

20:00.859 --> 20:02.991
their hometown
concert for tomorrow.

20:02.993 --> 20:04.026
Seriously?

20:04.028 --> 20:05.261
- Yeah.
- Oh this is perfect.

20:05.263 --> 20:06.095
Yeah.

20:06.097 --> 20:07.330
What does that mean?

20:07.332 --> 20:09.832
Oh man it means, you
bring the gas money

20:09.834 --> 20:11.934
and I'll bring the party.

20:19.976 --> 20:21.676
Hey Sam, I thought you
said that turn back there

20:21.678 --> 20:23.312
was supposed to be a shortcut?

20:23.314 --> 20:25.047
Yeah I'm
telling you it is.

20:25.049 --> 20:28.718
You know what, here,
check the map yourself.

20:30.454 --> 20:31.919
He's right.

20:31.921 --> 20:33.322
All we gotta do is
follow this road.

20:33.324 --> 20:35.022
Oh, uh, Chris.

20:35.024 --> 20:36.858
We have to stop at the
first town we come across

20:36.860 --> 20:38.025
before the concert.

20:38.027 --> 20:39.861
That way we can
get this done okay?

20:39.863 --> 20:41.429
Why don't you just buy the
candy and give it Barnhart?

20:41.431 --> 20:43.997
Oh no,
Sammy boy here believes

20:43.999 --> 20:46.933
candy given to you on All
Hallows Eve isn't just candy.

20:46.935 --> 20:48.935
It's candy with
the devil's touch.

20:48.937 --> 20:50.703
What?

20:50.705 --> 20:52.806
Oh yeah, it's just one of
his many rules of Halloween.

20:52.808 --> 20:54.074
Shut the hell up.

20:54.076 --> 20:56.076
What are you talking about?

20:56.078 --> 20:58.346
Oh, you guys will just
think they're stupid.

20:58.348 --> 20:59.812
No, come on tell us.

20:59.814 --> 21:02.082
What about the candy?

21:02.084 --> 21:04.484
Okay.

21:04.486 --> 21:09.389
So there's this rule about
candy I have called The Treat.

21:09.391 --> 21:12.459
It, uh, you know, say you
knock on someones door

21:12.461 --> 21:14.227
and say trick or treat.

21:14.229 --> 21:16.996
They give you candy, they
pick treat and all is well

21:16.998 --> 21:18.297
and that's their payment
to leave them alone

21:18.299 --> 21:19.498
and not play a trick.

21:19.500 --> 21:21.467
Therefore, it's more
than just candy.

21:21.469 --> 21:23.234
So it's like an offering?

21:23.236 --> 21:24.903
Yeah, exactly.

21:24.905 --> 21:27.805
Oh, alright okay, okay.

21:27.807 --> 21:29.942
Well you got anymore?

21:29.944 --> 21:31.075
Seriously?

21:31.077 --> 21:32.343
Hey, not to cut you guys off

21:32.345 --> 21:36.147
but I think there's
a town up ahead.

21:38.884 --> 21:42.022
Does that
sign say Deathville?

21:57.970 --> 21:59.203
Well guys,

21:59.205 --> 22:02.274
I think we may have
found our party spot.

22:07.179 --> 22:09.413
Where is this town?

22:13.985 --> 22:16.353
This must be
like an old back entrance

22:16.355 --> 22:21.257
or something, maybe that's
why the road is closed.

22:21.259 --> 22:23.459
I'm not finding it on the map.

22:23.461 --> 22:25.027
I mean it's not uncommon.

22:25.029 --> 22:26.563
A lot of these old towns
have been forgotten

22:26.565 --> 22:29.233
since the highways came through.

22:41.979 --> 22:46.381
Well there you go Sammy
boy, one last hurrah right?

22:46.383 --> 22:48.183
Well there it is.

22:48.185 --> 22:49.752
Your last hurrah.

23:00.895 --> 23:02.096
This is Dr. Rock

23:02.098 --> 23:04.131
reminding you to
buy your tickets

23:04.133 --> 23:07.834
for the Demon Inferno
Halloween concert.

23:07.836 --> 23:10.169
Buy your tickets tonight.

23:10.171 --> 23:11.037
Alright Sam, your turn.

23:11.039 --> 23:12.172
Truth or dare.

23:12.174 --> 23:13.040
Hold on a second Nixer,

23:13.042 --> 23:15.074
I just gotta know,
out of curiosity.

23:15.076 --> 23:16.843
Where's the old
egging houses thing

23:16.845 --> 23:19.078
fall into your list
of rules Sammy boy?

23:19.080 --> 23:21.615
Hey that's right, you
never finished your list.

23:21.617 --> 23:23.849
Come on, it's Halloween.

23:23.851 --> 23:25.017
- Tell the rest of 'em.
- Yeah come on Sam, tell us.

23:25.019 --> 23:26.185
- Yeah dude.
- Come on.

23:26.187 --> 23:27.954
That one's called The Trick,

23:27.956 --> 23:32.057
it's a means of causing
mischief or retaliation

23:32.059 --> 23:34.092
to whoever doesn't
make offerings.

23:34.094 --> 23:36.061
Tell me you got a
rule about partying?

23:37.031 --> 23:39.264
Yeah I do actually,
it's called The Harvest.

23:39.266 --> 23:41.967
It's a way for people to
thank the gods for their crops

23:41.969 --> 23:45.370
through celebration and
sometimes even human sacrifices.

23:45.372 --> 23:47.038
Is that it?

23:47.040 --> 23:48.272
Yeah, that's it.

23:48.274 --> 23:53.180
No, no no no, tell 'em the
one you call The Golden Rule.

23:53.480 --> 23:55.179
Ooh.

23:55.181 --> 23:57.014
Golden Rule, that
sounds pretty interesting.

23:57.016 --> 24:00.017
Yeah, it's actually called
Never Trick The Treat.

24:00.019 --> 24:02.254
You see it's when
a treat is given

24:02.256 --> 24:05.189
and the trick's played
on the giver afterwards.

24:05.191 --> 24:08.225
See if you truly
believe in evil,

24:08.227 --> 24:10.194
you never want to break
a deal on Halloween.

24:10.196 --> 24:11.595
This is the one
night of the year

24:11.597 --> 24:12.829
the devil can come for you.

24:12.831 --> 24:16.066
It's a good thing I don't
believe in any of that shit.

24:16.068 --> 24:17.635
I mean, it's just
like that barn legend

24:17.637 --> 24:20.170
we heard about growing up.

24:20.172 --> 24:21.338
Yeah, how did
that rhyme go again?

24:21.340 --> 24:22.605
Oh it was something like

24:22.607 --> 24:25.075
the Boogyeman will twist
your tits backwards

24:25.077 --> 24:26.576
whilst Hallow Jack
plows your butt

24:26.578 --> 24:28.378
and the Candy Corn
Scarecrow busts his nut.

24:30.282 --> 24:31.214
Cream corn.

24:31.216 --> 24:34.019
Ew.

24:36.220 --> 24:38.253
You know it's bullshit right?

24:38.255 --> 24:40.255
It's just some story
made up by farmers

24:40.257 --> 24:42.292
to keep kids off
their properties.

24:42.294 --> 24:44.326
Why do you think we're the
only ones out here tonight?

24:44.328 --> 24:46.962
What's your fascination
with this story anyway Sam?

24:46.964 --> 24:48.130
You mean obsession?

24:48.132 --> 24:49.266
No, seriously.

24:50.334 --> 24:51.334
Seriously?

24:55.506 --> 24:57.106
My grandfather heard the story

24:57.108 --> 24:59.974
when he was a teenager
working in the mines.

24:59.976 --> 25:02.477
So every year on Halloween
he'd tell me the tale.

25:02.479 --> 25:05.146
All October I couldn't go to
the sleep with lights off.

25:05.148 --> 25:07.013
All I could think about was

25:07.015 --> 25:09.584
Hallow Jack carving my
head out like a pumpkin,

25:09.586 --> 25:13.988
and the Candy Corn Scarecrow
ripping out my eyes.

25:13.990 --> 25:18.225
But, it was the thought
of the Boogeyman.

25:18.227 --> 25:21.462
That was the thought that kept
me from trick or treating.

25:21.464 --> 25:24.698
So, I just kind of
made up these rules

25:24.700 --> 25:26.566
from traditions in books

25:26.568 --> 25:30.436
and used them for
protection on Halloween.

25:30.438 --> 25:33.072
I don't know, stupid
kids stuff I guess.

25:33.074 --> 25:33.707
Yeah it is.

25:34.643 --> 25:36.276
No it's not, it's cute.

25:36.278 --> 25:39.947
Please a miner, a
scarecrow, a pumpkin man?

25:40.581 --> 25:42.248
Come on dude.

25:42.250 --> 25:45.284
It's not even possible to carve
someone's skull out anyways.

25:45.286 --> 25:48.153
Guys can we just
get back to the game.

25:48.155 --> 25:50.222
Sam truth or dare?

25:50.224 --> 25:51.390
Dare.

25:51.392 --> 25:54.360
I think I've said enough
truth for a night.

25:54.362 --> 25:57.061
I dare you to go
up to the barn door,

25:57.063 --> 26:01.132
knock three times and
say trick or treat.

26:01.134 --> 26:03.270
Hey, that sounds like fun.

26:04.337 --> 26:06.471
Why don't we all do it with him?

26:06.473 --> 26:09.608
I mean it is
Halloween after all.

26:32.097 --> 26:34.530
Well guys
we knock on the door

26:34.532 --> 26:36.466
and say trick or treat.

26:36.468 --> 26:37.801
Three times, that's
the rule right?

26:37.803 --> 26:39.403
How about if
we just do it twice?

26:39.405 --> 26:41.338
Dude, this legend in bogus.

26:41.340 --> 26:42.772
Monster's aren't real.

26:42.774 --> 26:44.340
Yeah.

26:44.342 --> 26:45.274
Give me your hand Sam,

26:45.276 --> 26:46.209
I'll show you once and for all

26:46.211 --> 26:49.347
there's no such thing
as the Boogeymman.

26:55.720 --> 26:57.286
Trick or treat.

27:04.361 --> 27:05.661
Trick or treat.

27:10.567 --> 27:12.200
Trick or treat.

27:17.273 --> 27:18.642
See Sam, nothing.

27:23.145 --> 27:24.745
What the hell?

27:24.747 --> 27:28.215
Dude, I you
said it was locked?

27:28.217 --> 27:29.051
It was.

27:32.788 --> 27:34.321
Hey, don't go in there.

27:34.323 --> 27:35.489
Don't go in there man.

27:35.491 --> 27:36.590
It's alright.

27:36.592 --> 27:38.391
Dude, what is he doing?

27:38.393 --> 27:40.761
What, what is he doing?

27:40.763 --> 27:45.332
Yeah guys, maybe this really
is the barn of the light.

27:48.270 --> 27:49.269
Ah, too easy.

27:49.271 --> 27:50.103
Son of a bitch.

27:50.105 --> 27:51.373
Son of a bitch.

27:58.813 --> 28:00.248
Russ, you okay?

28:02.117 --> 28:04.051
Check this place out.

28:06.453 --> 28:10.856
It's a lot bigger than
it looks from the outside.

28:16.397 --> 28:19.198
Check out the bitching mower.

28:25.873 --> 28:27.707
That is totally grody.

28:34.479 --> 28:39.283
Someone better check the
expiration date on those.

28:39.285 --> 28:40.451
Russ?

28:40.453 --> 28:41.554
You okay man?

28:47.627 --> 28:48.458
Boo!

28:51.897 --> 28:53.363
Shit dude.

28:55.901 --> 28:58.536
Ah that was good one.

28:59.537 --> 29:01.170
Gross,

29:01.172 --> 29:02.672
this must have been a
slaughterhouse or something.

29:02.674 --> 29:04.341
Why do you say that?

29:04.343 --> 29:06.308
'Cause it
smells like rotten meat.

29:06.310 --> 29:09.378
Yeah
seriously, barf-a-rama.

29:09.380 --> 29:10.412
I don't know boys,

29:10.414 --> 29:12.481
but y'all should probably
head back into town.

29:12.483 --> 29:14.817
Times a ticking and
y'all got about an hour

29:14.819 --> 29:16.819
before this van books out.

29:16.821 --> 29:19.824
Chill dude, we'll
be back in time.

29:21.425 --> 29:24.160
I'll grab you a
costume Michelle.

29:29.533 --> 29:30.965
What about you Russ,
you coming along?

29:30.967 --> 29:32.467
Nah, you go have fun.

29:32.469 --> 29:33.935
I think I'm gonna
hang here and veg.

29:33.937 --> 29:35.403
And try to figure out

29:35.405 --> 29:36.972
where the hell that
smells coming from.

29:36.974 --> 29:39.876
Alright, well
have fun with that.

29:55.323 --> 29:56.157
Damn.

30:15.878 --> 30:16.711
Grody.

30:19.279 --> 30:20.213
To the max.

30:26.586 --> 30:28.921
Shit Sam, you scared
the hell out of me.

30:28.923 --> 30:32.457
Hey, kill that light, I
found a fucking head yo.

30:32.459 --> 30:33.926
Seriously Sam what the...

30:35.327 --> 30:36.661
Oh shit!

31:15.667 --> 31:17.600
So what's this big surprise?

31:17.602 --> 31:19.571
Take your blindfold off.

31:20.772 --> 31:23.705
Christopher,
this is awesome.

31:23.707 --> 31:25.407
When did you do all this?

31:25.409 --> 31:27.844
I found it while you and
your gal pal were chatting.

31:27.846 --> 31:29.946
You know, I figured if someone
went through all this trouble

31:29.948 --> 31:32.914
to leave it out here, we might
as well make some use of it.

31:32.916 --> 31:34.416
You know, stare at the stars.

31:34.418 --> 31:35.985
Snuggle up on this Hallow night.

31:35.987 --> 31:37.586
You're too romantic.

31:37.588 --> 31:42.359
But, the real reason I
brought you out for, was this.

31:44.962 --> 31:47.728
Oh my god, Christopher.

31:47.730 --> 31:49.665
It's beautiful, thank you.

31:51.869 --> 31:54.468
So, where did we leave off?

31:54.470 --> 31:57.371
I believe you were
rounding first base,

31:57.373 --> 31:58.506
on your way to second.

31:58.508 --> 31:59.709
That's right.

32:01.644 --> 32:03.878

33:12.512 --> 33:14.744
Double affirmative.

33:14.746 --> 33:16.046
What do you boys have planned?

33:16.048 --> 33:18.915
Ooh tonight it's about reclaiming
what was taken from us.

33:18.917 --> 33:21.152
Anybody that tells
us we're too old

33:21.154 --> 33:23.552
to go trick or treating is
getting a face full of yolk

33:23.554 --> 33:25.088
and a tree full of tee pee.

33:25.090 --> 33:26.523
And the M-80's?

33:26.525 --> 33:27.791
Them be for pumpkins.

33:27.793 --> 33:29.492
Okay, alright.

33:29.494 --> 33:31.894
Whoa, Wheary Falls huh?

33:31.896 --> 33:34.697
Apparently that's
Deathville's real name.

33:35.633 --> 33:36.565
Trust me when I say it.

33:36.567 --> 33:38.667
Stay away from them pumpkins.

33:38.669 --> 33:40.569
This is how they watch us.

33:43.908 --> 33:46.909
Oh no no, no no, every year.

33:46.911 --> 33:49.778
Yeah well, you'll
thank me tomorrow

33:49.780 --> 33:51.981
when you're all still alive.

33:51.983 --> 33:54.816
Oh hi kids, great costumes.

33:54.818 --> 33:55.717
Oh, no way.

34:01.958 --> 34:05.026
Okay so let me
ask you a question.

34:05.028 --> 34:08.696
Anything babe.

34:08.697 --> 34:11.764
What's your whole take on
Michelle and her virgin act?

34:11.766 --> 34:13.636
It's, it's no act.

34:14.838 --> 34:17.607
She's an honest
to God good girl.

34:18.741 --> 34:21.742
I think there's
someone watching us.

34:21.744 --> 34:22.578
Where?

34:25.813 --> 34:29.482
You know I bet it's
Russell, freaking pervert.

34:29.484 --> 34:33.053
Bet that hose has been
watching us the whole time.

34:33.054 --> 34:34.954
Give me a sec babe.

34:34.956 --> 34:38.893
I'm gonna go follow him
and tell him something.

34:52.139 --> 34:53.908
Chris, is that you?

34:57.712 --> 34:58.977
This isn't funny.

35:09.890 --> 35:13.060
Screw this, I'm going
back to the van.

35:19.699 --> 35:21.899
Russell you scared
the shit out of me.

35:21.901 --> 35:23.767
What are you wearing?

35:23.769 --> 35:25.936
Can you even see out of that?

35:25.938 --> 35:29.872
Anyways, Chris is looking for
you and he's super pissed.

35:29.874 --> 35:32.076
How'd you even
get this thing on?

35:43.822 --> 35:44.922
Help!

35:57.568 --> 36:00.602
Oh.

36:00.604 --> 36:01.239
Oh man.

36:03.040 --> 36:04.806
I'll tell you
one thing for sure,

36:04.808 --> 36:07.876
no one is ever gonna forget
the tale of Sam and Josh.

36:07.878 --> 36:10.979
Two guys took on Bitchy
Barnhart and destroyed her.

36:10.981 --> 36:13.882
I mean, that's one heck of
a legacy to leave behind.

36:13.884 --> 36:17.987
Kids are gonna be talking
about you guys forever.

36:19.589 --> 36:20.921
Do you really
want your legacy in this town

36:20.923 --> 36:25.327
to be the kid who was so obsessed
with himself and Halloween

36:25.329 --> 36:28.530
that he didn't know
when to grow up?

36:29.732 --> 36:30.566
Yeah.

36:31.267 --> 36:33.270
Yeah, I was thinking of.

36:34.936 --> 36:36.270
You mind waiting for up Josh,

36:36.272 --> 36:37.872
I gotta go back and get
those houses you know.

36:37.874 --> 36:39.774
They had some
pretty good treats.

36:39.776 --> 36:41.611
And double up on some.

36:46.681 --> 36:48.748
I'll be right back, I'm
gonna get you for that.

36:55.157 --> 36:57.159
So, what do you think?

36:58.159 --> 36:59.858
He's great.

36:59.860 --> 37:01.094
What?

37:01.096 --> 37:03.829
Oh you mean trick,
trick or treating.

37:03.831 --> 37:06.000
It's, it's awesome, I, um.

37:10.037 --> 37:12.871
If I told you something
could you keep it a secret?

37:12.873 --> 37:14.806
I think I can handle a secret.

37:14.808 --> 37:19.044
Okay well, I've kind of had
a crush on Sam for a while now

37:19.046 --> 37:23.114
and I'm not, I'm not
really sure about it.

37:23.116 --> 37:24.715
What aren't
you sure about?

37:24.717 --> 37:26.285
I'm not sure if he likes me,

37:26.287 --> 37:28.886
or if he's just
being nice to me.

37:28.888 --> 37:30.190
What do you think?

37:31.791 --> 37:36.029
I think you should follow
your heart on this one.

37:48.907 --> 37:50.040
Hey penis breath,

37:50.042 --> 37:51.875
you were pretty fast
getting back here

37:51.877 --> 37:54.712
but I know it was
you watching us.

37:56.115 --> 37:58.315
Oh, you're not Russell.

38:08.926 --> 38:09.861
Hey uh, um.

38:12.063 --> 38:17.101
I'm looking for the guy that
was wearing those headphones.

38:21.072 --> 38:22.039
What the fuck?

38:46.095 --> 38:47.928
What the fuck?

39:00.309 --> 39:01.143
Nikki!

39:06.047 --> 39:07.081
Nikki!

39:08.283 --> 39:09.751
Fuck man where?

39:11.152 --> 39:12.452
Oh.

39:12.454 --> 39:14.387
No, no, no, no fucking.

39:14.389 --> 39:16.055
Holy shit.

39:16.057 --> 39:17.158
I'm so sorry.

39:18.826 --> 39:19.460
Oh shit.

39:56.195 --> 39:57.027
Fuck.

39:57.029 --> 39:57.928
Keep going.

40:03.402 --> 40:06.971
So um, you
having fun tonight?

40:06.973 --> 40:08.138
No.

40:08.140 --> 40:09.340
Oh.

40:09.342 --> 40:13.009
It's exactly how
I thought it would be, you?

40:13.011 --> 40:15.178
I didn't think this night
could get much radder, you know.

40:15.180 --> 40:19.115
You being here, this is, this
is the best Halloween ever.

40:19.117 --> 40:22.118
I'm so glad you invited me.

40:22.120 --> 40:23.553
Me too.

40:28.493 --> 40:31.160
Well Sam boy, that's it.

40:31.162 --> 40:32.930
Mission accomplished.

40:34.531 --> 40:37.334
Damn Sam, look at
your candy sack.

40:39.003 --> 40:40.369
Did you really go back to
every house for seconds?

40:40.371 --> 40:42.069
This, this is nothing.

40:42.071 --> 40:44.172
What's in it, let me see.

40:44.174 --> 40:45.006
I don't think that...

40:45.008 --> 40:46.074
Is that Chris?

40:48.045 --> 40:49.011
Hey have you seen anyone

40:49.013 --> 40:51.512
dressed like the devil
and the grim reaper?

40:51.514 --> 40:52.980
Oh what.

40:52.982 --> 40:53.751
Oh shit.

40:56.152 --> 40:58.885
Now why would Chris be
running down the street?

40:58.887 --> 41:01.088
Come on guys let's go.

41:02.125 --> 41:02.959
Oh.

41:05.028 --> 41:06.460
Hey what the hell man?

41:08.130 --> 41:10.331
Did that guy
just steal your candy sack?

41:10.333 --> 41:11.599
Yeah.

41:11.601 --> 41:13.000
Well what are we
waiting for dude.

41:13.002 --> 41:16.236
Yeah but, did you
see their faces?

41:16.238 --> 41:17.937
Yeah Sam, they're
dressed like your demons.

41:17.939 --> 41:20.240
So we gonna cover their
faces in egg yolk or what?

41:20.242 --> 41:21.409
Let's just forget
about it guys,

41:21.411 --> 41:23.075
we don't know these people.

41:23.077 --> 41:25.911
Dammit, there was more
than just candy in that bag.

41:25.913 --> 41:27.247
Let's go to the
school house party

41:27.249 --> 41:28.248
I heard people talking about.

41:28.250 --> 41:29.182
I'm sure there's gonna be

41:29.184 --> 41:30.983
candy with the devils
touch on it there.

41:30.985 --> 41:33.919
Fine, but only for five
minutes and then we gotta split.

41:33.921 --> 41:36.157
We can't miss this concert.

41:38.192 --> 41:39.226
Hey.

41:40.528 --> 41:41.493
Wait up.

41:43.197 --> 41:44.263
Hey you,
don't touch that dial.

41:44.265 --> 41:46.130
There's much more
madness to come

41:46.132 --> 41:49.201
here at Monster Madness
on Channel Three.

41:55.241 --> 41:56.441
There's
a radio on the truck.

41:57.377 --> 41:58.176
Hmm?

41:58.178 --> 42:00.213
More trick or treaters.

42:01.181 --> 42:02.613
This gasoline truck

42:02.615 --> 42:04.549
came speeding right
across the road.

42:04.551 --> 42:06.250
Hmm.

42:06.252 --> 42:08.086
Their must've
been 10, 15 of these things

42:08.088 --> 42:09.289
chasing after it.

42:16.396 --> 42:19.096
You kids scared me to death.

42:19.098 --> 42:22.265
Your costumes are great,
they're so realistic.

42:22.267 --> 42:25.335

more apples don't you.

42:25.337 --> 42:27.704
Did you come in here
for some more apples?

That children's rhyme
has glorified those beasts

45:11.695 --> 45:13.628
for way too long now.

45:13.630 --> 45:18.567
So I'm gonna tell you guys
this for your own protection.

45:18.569 --> 45:22.436
You see, the part many
folks don't realize is,

45:22.438 --> 45:25.706
it was the devil himself that
sent those creatures here

45:25.708 --> 45:29.544
to take the flesh of
the living back to hell.

45:29.546 --> 45:32.047
Okay, see you in a few, bye.

45:33.383 --> 45:34.882
Matthew.

45:34.884 --> 45:36.784
The miner, the
one they call the Boogeyman.

45:37.719 --> 45:39.452
He's the Devil's right hand man.

45:39.454 --> 45:41.421
In the beginning he was
in charge of digging

45:41.423 --> 45:45.458
that godforsaken tunnel
out of hell into our world.

45:45.460 --> 45:47.294
You're probably too
young to remember

45:47.296 --> 45:49.729
the mining incident in the 30's.

45:49.731 --> 45:52.867
But I believe those miners
stumbled upon that tunnel.

46:00.409 --> 46:03.175
Oh yeah, so that's why he's
dressed like a miner too.

46:03.177 --> 46:04.543
Digging holes and stuff, yeah.

46:04.545 --> 46:07.246
What, what do you
know about Hallow Jack?

46:07.248 --> 46:08.447
The pumpkin man?

46:08.449 --> 46:10.349
Oh he's the watcher.

46:10.351 --> 46:13.552
He can take anyone of those
pumpkins out of his patch

46:13.554 --> 46:17.488
and use them for his eyes
to watch over the land.

46:17.490 --> 46:20.458
He signals the other ones
of approaching flesh.

46:20.460 --> 46:23.762
So he's like a,
he's like a guard dog huh?

46:28.602 --> 46:30.501
So that's why you were
smashing pumpkins.

46:30.503 --> 46:32.203
Or just because
he's a crazy drunk.

46:32.205 --> 46:34.237
But, let's just.

46:34.239 --> 46:37.609
Tell us what you know about
uh, the Candy Corn Scarecrow.

46:37.611 --> 46:41.211
The straw man, well he's
the protector of the harvest.

46:41.213 --> 46:45.482
He makes sure the crops
grow right and stay safe.

46:45.484 --> 46:48.620
He'll chew up anything with
those rotten teeth of his,

46:48.622 --> 46:51.321
that try to enter that
ground, to harm that corn.

46:52.825 --> 46:57.627
So how exactly do you know
so much about all this again?

46:57.629 --> 47:00.864
Because, when I
was a younger boy

47:00.866 --> 47:05.534
I watched them slaughter
my best friend Shirley.

47:05.536 --> 47:07.703
I'm sure y'all realize by now

47:07.705 --> 47:10.874
that no one around
here believes me.

47:10.876 --> 47:13.776
They all think that she died
from some equipment accident

47:13.778 --> 47:15.713
that night at the barn.

47:17.247 --> 47:20.282
So why didn't they kill you?

47:20.284 --> 47:21.316
I don't know.

47:21.318 --> 47:24.887
It's like they just didn't
see me or something.

47:24.889 --> 47:26.656
Where you wearing
a mask or something?

47:26.658 --> 47:29.991
Come on, this guy's
obviously had one too many.

47:29.993 --> 47:33.228
Maybe I have son,
but I've earned it.

47:33.230 --> 47:36.297
For the last three decades,
I've done everything I could

47:36.299 --> 47:38.967
to keep those creatures
from coming into town.

47:38.969 --> 47:44.173
But nobody here appreciates
it because nobody believes it.

47:44.641 --> 47:45.908
I can relate.

47:49.612 --> 47:50.511
Here you go boys.

47:50.513 --> 47:51.545
Thanks Michelle.

47:51.547 --> 47:52.546
Hmm-mm.

47:52.548 --> 47:54.014
Thanks.

47:54.016 --> 47:56.282
So, if you've
seen these monsters

47:56.284 --> 47:57.685
then you know where the barn is?

47:57.687 --> 48:00.554
Sam we gotta jam, we
don't even have tickets yet.

48:00.556 --> 48:03.891
Would you stop spazzing about
the concert for one minute?

48:03.893 --> 48:04.758
You know what?

48:04.760 --> 48:06.694
I've had enough.

48:06.696 --> 48:08.629
I know you're hoping for some
validation from this guy,

48:08.631 --> 48:09.762
but you need to accept it Sam.

48:09.764 --> 48:11.431
Your dad's right.

48:11.433 --> 48:13.599
You need to grow up and
forget about all this crap.

48:13.601 --> 48:14.434
Are you kidding me?

48:14.436 --> 48:15.368
You too?

48:15.370 --> 48:16.536
Okay boys let's just chill out

48:16.538 --> 48:17.569
before we say
something we regret.

48:17.571 --> 48:19.005
No it's okay Michelle.

48:19.007 --> 48:21.974
Go ahead Sam,
what's your damage?

48:21.976 --> 48:23.543
Ever since your dad died

48:23.545 --> 48:27.046
you've been this completely
different person.

48:27.048 --> 48:28.513
Oh yeah.

48:28.515 --> 48:29.715
You just want me to
believe in all this

48:29.717 --> 48:32.618
Halloween legend mumbo-jumbo,
that's all this is about.

48:32.620 --> 48:34.351
But while we're being honest,

48:34.353 --> 48:35.754
why don't you
inform Michelle here

48:35.756 --> 48:38.056
that I'm the reason
she came along.

48:38.058 --> 48:39.958
Because you weren't
gonna ask her.

48:39.960 --> 48:40.960
What?

48:40.962 --> 48:42.595
Is that true Sam?

48:43.596 --> 48:44.830
Kind of.

48:44.832 --> 48:48.600
It's not like I didn't
want you to come along.

48:48.602 --> 48:50.668
I'm going back to the van.

48:50.670 --> 48:52.505
Michelle wait.

48:54.074 --> 48:56.041
Well how about this whole
trick or treating punishment

48:56.043 --> 48:58.441
was for me and for me alone.

48:58.443 --> 49:00.376
You didn't have to come along.

49:00.378 --> 49:01.679
So you lied to me?

49:01.681 --> 49:04.749
You made me dress
up like an idiot?

49:04.751 --> 49:06.583
Hey man, you made
the assumption.

49:06.585 --> 49:08.551
Unbelievable.

49:08.553 --> 49:10.721
For years I've saved your ass.

49:10.723 --> 49:12.792
Well guess what, I'm out.

49:14.459 --> 49:16.926
And I'm keeping the
candy, so suck it.

49:16.928 --> 49:17.994
Fine.

49:17.996 --> 49:18.830
Go.

49:42.820 --> 49:43.654
Sam!

49:45.055 --> 49:46.487
Chris?

49:46.489 --> 49:47.688
What are you, what
are you doing here?

49:47.690 --> 49:49.657
Russell, Nikki,
they're all dead man.

49:49.659 --> 49:52.830
The legends real, I
saw the Boogeyman.

49:54.030 --> 49:56.664
I watched him eat a
fucking face burger

49:56.666 --> 49:58.666
made out of Russell's head.

49:58.668 --> 49:59.634
What?

49:59.636 --> 50:00.301
Three of 'em, just
like the legend said,

50:00.303 --> 50:02.737
they followed me into town.

50:02.739 --> 50:04.071
Now everybody's gone,
they're all dead.

50:14.117 --> 50:17.050
♪ People yeah

50:22.724 --> 50:23.559
Yeah!

50:33.501 --> 50:35.634
Here's another one for ya.

50:52.485 --> 50:53.453
Holy shit.

50:59.426 --> 51:00.658
You burned me good.

51:00.660 --> 51:01.192
I'm gonna go get
my candy back now.

51:11.738 --> 51:12.572
Hey ugly.

51:13.772 --> 51:17.143
Jokes over buddy, I
want my candy back now.

51:18.577 --> 51:19.743
Are you deaf penis?

51:19.745 --> 51:20.744
Give me the bag.

51:46.804 --> 51:48.572
Come on, come on.

51:50.074 --> 51:51.807
Go, go come on!

51:51.809 --> 51:52.908
Oh my god!

52:11.895 --> 52:14.195
What do you want you freak?

52:22.205 --> 52:26.173
Screw this guys, I'm
going back to the van.

52:52.968 --> 52:53.800
Stop.

52:53.802 --> 52:54.667
Oh my god!

52:54.669 --> 52:55.469
Oh my God!

53:02.977 --> 53:04.210
What are they doing?

53:04.212 --> 53:06.244
They're collecting
their treats.

53:06.246 --> 53:08.680
What do you think this
night's all about?

53:08.682 --> 53:10.949
That flesh is for the devil.

53:10.951 --> 53:12.718
I knew it was only
a matter of time

53:12.720 --> 53:14.952
before they'd come into
town for a feeding.

53:14.954 --> 53:16.288
Is there anyway to stop them?

53:16.290 --> 53:17.722
You can't.

53:17.724 --> 53:19.791
As long as there's
flesh to take back.

53:19.793 --> 53:20.791
They're not gonna stop

53:20.793 --> 53:23.861
'til whoever knocked on
that doors ground meat.

53:23.863 --> 53:25.830
We gotta find Michelle
before those creatures do.

53:25.832 --> 53:27.832
There is one more option boys.

53:27.834 --> 53:29.766
They only have 'til midnight.

53:29.768 --> 53:31.235
So if I can stop
'em from collecting,

53:31.237 --> 53:35.241
maybe there's a chance
that'll stop the feeding.

53:41.847 --> 53:42.879
Come on.

53:42.881 --> 53:43.713
Come on.

53:43.715 --> 53:44.348
Get back.

53:44.350 --> 53:45.181
Back.

53:45.183 --> 53:46.282
Come on.

53:46.284 --> 53:47.817
We gotta help him.

53:47.819 --> 53:48.651
How man?

53:48.653 --> 53:49.285
They'll kill us.

53:49.287 --> 53:50.687
I don't know.

53:50.689 --> 53:52.022
Think, you know
all the traditions.

53:52.024 --> 53:54.759
Just give me a
minute to think.

53:56.827 --> 53:57.996
Put your mask on.

53:59.164 --> 54:00.963
Look around man, no one
else is left standing

54:00.965 --> 54:03.866
they aren't dressed scary.

54:29.259 --> 54:31.261
Oh shit, Jesus Christ.

54:47.343 --> 54:50.077
Holy shit that worked.

54:50.079 --> 54:51.346
I tried boys.

54:52.948 --> 54:55.851
They were just too
strong together.

54:57.085 --> 55:00.253
If you want any chance
of saving your friends,

55:00.255 --> 55:02.189
you gotta get back to that barn.

55:02.191 --> 55:04.357
Here, I don't know what this is,

55:04.359 --> 55:06.425
it was on the miner's neck.

55:06.427 --> 55:08.828
It might be important.

55:08.830 --> 55:10.896
I found this too.

55:10.898 --> 55:13.064
I'm a goner boys.

55:13.066 --> 55:15.167
You freed me from this burden.

55:15.169 --> 55:17.837
Just do me one more favor.

55:17.839 --> 55:20.972
Send those motherfuckers
back to hell.

55:31.718 --> 55:33.852
The plan is we
stop the feeding.

55:33.854 --> 55:34.953
Shouldn't we be
searching the barn

55:34.955 --> 55:36.087
for Michelle and Chris first?

55:36.089 --> 55:37.020
No.

55:37.022 --> 55:38.956
If we go in that barn
we're all goners.

55:38.958 --> 55:40.191
You saw what happened to George

55:40.193 --> 55:42.693
when he took them
all on at once.

55:42.695 --> 55:44.062
Wait.

55:44.064 --> 55:46.130
He said they were all
protectors of different places.

55:46.132 --> 55:48.132
And what does that
have to do with anything?

55:48.134 --> 55:49.333
We go to the
places they protect

55:49.335 --> 55:51.001
and we call them out one by one.

55:51.003 --> 55:53.337
So how do we get
their attention?

55:53.339 --> 55:55.038
We follow my rules.

55:55.040 --> 55:58.008
We knocked on that barn door
and we said trick or treat.

55:58.010 --> 55:59.143
And guess what?

55:59.145 --> 56:00.444
They didn't give us a treat.

56:00.446 --> 56:02.145
So we give them a trick.

56:02.147 --> 56:03.779
Exactly.

I guess this is where

56:50.026 --> 56:53.827
Hallow Jack waits
for a person's flesh.

56:53.829 --> 56:56.063
How are we gonna draw him out?

56:56.065 --> 56:57.364
Here, here give me an egg.

56:57.366 --> 56:59.066
Give me an egg.

56:59.068 --> 57:01.969
Come on man, come on,
hurry, give me an egg.

57:01.971 --> 57:03.204

Did you hear that?

57:56.189 --> 57:57.090
What?

58:07.200 --> 58:08.199
Josh?

58:35.226 --> 58:36.258
What's up?

58:41.031 --> 58:41.863
Huh?

58:43.567 --> 58:45.167
It doesn't just see
through the pumpkins,

58:45.169 --> 58:46.101
it becomes them.

58:46.103 --> 58:48.636
Josh, we need to start
smashing pumpkins.

59:16.465 --> 59:17.665
Is that all of 'em?

59:18.601 --> 59:20.300
Yeah I'm pretty sure.

59:20.302 --> 59:22.134
Well that was easy.

59:22.136 --> 59:23.270
Yeah.

59:39.020 --> 59:40.353
What the?

59:40.355 --> 59:42.521
What the hell is this?

59:42.523 --> 59:43.623
Josh?

59:43.625 --> 59:45.390
Sam?

59:47.628 --> 59:48.463
Go!

59:55.703 --> 59:57.235
Josh, Josh quick.

59:57.237 --> 59:58.439
Pump it, pump it.

59:59.474 --> 01:00:00.472
It's stuck.

01:00:00.474 --> 01:00:02.307
Just pump it!

01:00:13.353 --> 01:00:14.952
I can't believe that worked.

01:00:14.954 --> 01:00:17.154
I can't believe that worked.

01:00:17.156 --> 01:00:17.990
Holy shit.

01:00:25.029 --> 01:00:25.664
Come on.

01:00:28.601 --> 01:00:30.336
It worked, it worked.

01:00:53.358 --> 01:00:54.158
Ew.

01:00:58.429 --> 01:00:59.430
Josh.

01:01:00.297 --> 01:01:02.431
Light the M-80's.

01:01:02.433 --> 01:01:04.568
Let's make some pumpkin pie.

01:01:09.473 --> 01:01:12.442
See you
later alligator.

01:01:24.454 --> 01:01:25.519
We did it.

01:01:25.521 --> 01:01:28.224
I can't believe that worked.

01:01:29.157 --> 01:01:30.290
Now what?

01:01:30.292 --> 01:01:33.061
Uh, we get to the corn field.

01:01:52.513 --> 01:01:56.248
Come on let's burn
this mother down.

01:01:57.351 --> 01:01:58.118
Shh, shh.

01:02:00.454 --> 01:02:01.755
Did you hear that?

01:02:12.433 --> 01:02:13.467
Nikki.

01:02:24.110 --> 01:02:26.444
Where are you you
Candy Corn bastard!

01:02:26.446 --> 01:02:27.514
Josh.

01:02:29.816 --> 01:02:31.215
Come on!

01:02:31.217 --> 01:02:33.283
Josh, shut up.

01:02:33.285 --> 01:02:35.485
We don't know what else
is out in that field.

01:02:35.487 --> 01:02:37.120
Calm down.

01:02:49.568 --> 01:02:50.700
I'm gonna kill you.

01:02:50.702 --> 01:02:52.201
Yeah, yeah.

01:02:52.203 --> 01:02:53.171
He's mine.

01:03:27.170 --> 01:03:28.468
Eat shit and die.

01:03:37.513 --> 01:03:39.315
That was for Nikki.

01:03:40.482 --> 01:03:43.618
Sam, light up that corn stock.

01:03:43.620 --> 01:03:46.453
Let's what this piece
of shit straw man burn.

01:03:48.457 --> 01:03:49.857
Josh!

01:03:49.859 --> 01:03:50.693
Sam.

01:04:04.172 --> 01:04:04.807
No!

01:04:18.352 --> 01:04:19.186
Ew.

01:04:36.670 --> 01:04:37.504
Josh?

01:04:40.673 --> 01:04:42.907
Sam, Sam!

01:04:42.909 --> 01:04:44.375
Josh!

01:04:45.912 --> 01:04:46.747
Josh!

01:04:48.481 --> 01:04:49.314
No!

01:04:50.416 --> 01:04:51.250
Come back.

01:04:52.985 --> 01:04:53.917
No.

01:04:53.919 --> 01:04:55.619
No, no no no no.

01:04:55.621 --> 01:04:56.454
Josh.

01:04:58.590 --> 01:04:59.625
Josh.

01:05:38.294 --> 01:05:39.930
I can't do this alone.

01:07:19.958 --> 01:07:24.360
As I said before, a
special evening is upon us.

01:07:24.362 --> 01:07:26.797
It was not that long ago now,

01:07:26.799 --> 01:07:28.831
but I can still
remember the night

01:07:28.833 --> 01:07:30.533
that He came to me

01:07:30.535 --> 01:07:34.436
and said He had heard my
unanswered prayers for help.

01:07:34.438 --> 01:07:36.538
He said He would
restore our soil

01:07:36.540 --> 01:07:38.741
and help us bring
back our harvest

01:07:38.743 --> 01:07:43.078
if only we would help restore
what had been taken from Him.

01:07:43.080 --> 01:07:47.448
Now every Halloween, curious
teenagers come to these doors

01:07:47.450 --> 01:07:51.920
in search of our legend and
to fall prey to our plan.

01:07:51.922 --> 01:07:55.657
As I said before, a
special evening is upon us.

01:07:55.659 --> 01:07:58.726
Because at midnight tonight,

01:07:58.728 --> 01:08:02.964
when the harvest moon
shines at its brightest.

01:08:02.966 --> 01:08:07.737
The Lord will rise from His
pits to collect His treats.

01:08:10.173 --> 01:08:14.876
He's especially
going to like this one.

01:08:14.878 --> 01:08:17.176
Come on my dear.

01:08:18.113 --> 01:08:18.946
You are going to be the treat

01:08:18.948 --> 01:08:20.647
that he saves 'til last.

01:08:22.751 --> 01:08:26.886
Oh I see one of our
protectors has returned.

01:08:26.889 --> 01:08:29.522
Is that what's left
of the teenagers?

01:08:29.524 --> 01:08:32.124
Ah, then let the ceremony begin.

01:08:32.126 --> 01:08:34.926
Oh Lord we offer
these gifts to You.

01:08:34.929 --> 01:08:37.729
- Except this virgins strength.
- No.

01:08:37.732 --> 01:08:39.465
For all that You
have done for us

01:08:39.466 --> 01:08:41.701
and a token of
Your appreciation.

01:08:44.839 --> 01:08:45.673
What the?

01:08:47.575 --> 01:08:48.974
Everybody stand still.

01:08:48.975 --> 01:08:50.209
Don't move or I'll
cut his head off,

01:08:50.211 --> 01:08:52.676
just like I did your scarecrow.

01:08:52.679 --> 01:08:54.779
Son, I think
you're outnumbered.

01:09:17.904 --> 01:09:18.769
Sam!

01:09:18.770 --> 01:09:20.804
You're still alive.

01:09:33.853 --> 01:09:35.785
It's time to harvest bitch.

01:09:41.725 --> 01:09:43.029
Get away from her.

01:09:44.595 --> 01:09:45.429
Come on.

01:09:46.798 --> 01:09:47.764
Josh, come on let's go.

01:09:47.765 --> 01:09:49.765
I got it Sam, just
get in the van and go.

01:09:49.768 --> 01:09:50.966
What?

01:09:50.969 --> 01:09:51.966
Someone's gotta stay and
make sure the feeding ends.

01:09:51.969 --> 01:09:52.834
Just go.

01:09:52.836 --> 01:09:54.069
- No!
- Both of you.

01:09:54.071 --> 01:09:55.637
Come on.

01:10:14.959 --> 01:10:16.023
Take this.

01:10:16.025 --> 01:10:16.859
Okay.

01:10:21.631 --> 01:10:22.832
Get in the van.

01:10:27.103 --> 01:10:28.803
I need you to wear this.

01:10:28.805 --> 01:10:30.204
Sam, I know he said to
go but we can't leave him.

01:10:30.206 --> 01:10:31.639
They need you now, okay.

01:10:31.641 --> 01:10:32.939
You've become part
of the feeding.

01:10:32.941 --> 01:10:35.209
If you don't go, it won't end.

01:10:35.211 --> 01:10:37.811
Alright look,
you're gonna drive.

01:10:37.813 --> 01:10:39.913
You're gonna drive
as far as you can.

01:10:39.915 --> 01:10:41.114
You're gonna find a payphone,

01:10:41.116 --> 01:10:43.683
you're gonna call for help
and you're gonna keep driving.

01:10:43.685 --> 01:10:45.051
No, I'm not gonna
leave you here.

01:10:50.092 --> 01:10:51.757
You have to.

01:10:51.759 --> 01:10:55.863
If I don't make it back,
make sure Barnhart gets this.

01:10:59.334 --> 01:11:03.537
I wanna be remembered for
doing the right thing.

01:11:10.911 --> 01:11:12.010
Now go.

01:11:12.012 --> 01:11:13.046
Drive.

01:11:27.826 --> 01:11:28.925
Why would you do this?

01:11:28.927 --> 01:11:30.794
You're supposed to
be a man of God.

01:11:30.796 --> 01:11:32.196
I am a man of God.

01:11:32.198 --> 01:11:34.132
Just not your God.

01:11:34.134 --> 01:11:37.701
He betrayed us and
left us with nothing.

01:11:37.703 --> 01:11:38.835
Well what's the point
in having a harvest

01:11:38.837 --> 01:11:40.103
if your whole town is dead.

01:11:40.105 --> 01:11:41.105
What are you talking about?

01:11:41.107 --> 01:11:42.340
Your protectors.

01:11:42.342 --> 01:11:44.007
They did a lot more
killing than protecting

01:11:44.009 --> 01:11:45.175
at your town dance tonight.

01:11:45.177 --> 01:11:47.044
Impossible.

01:11:47.046 --> 01:11:49.146
Well they're all dead now.

01:11:49.148 --> 01:11:50.313
You may have convinced them

01:11:50.315 --> 01:11:51.981
the barn was condemned
and dangerous.

01:11:51.983 --> 01:11:53.983
But they didn't
believe in the legend

01:11:53.985 --> 01:11:56.987
and that's what made
them weak and helpless.

01:11:56.989 --> 01:11:58.188
Hey.

01:11:58.190 --> 01:11:59.722
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

01:11:59.724 --> 01:12:00.856
Sam.

01:12:00.858 --> 01:12:01.824
What are you doing here?

01:12:01.826 --> 01:12:03.192
Where's Michelle?

01:12:03.194 --> 01:12:04.627
I sent her to go get help.

01:12:04.629 --> 01:12:05.362
But we gotta bigger
fish to fry than him.

01:12:05.364 --> 01:12:06.796
Give me the weedkiller.

01:12:06.798 --> 01:12:07.962
The Boogeyman's
still out there man.

01:12:08.799 --> 01:12:09.932
Oh Heavenly Father

01:12:09.934 --> 01:12:11.233
I pray for Your
guidance and protection.

01:12:11.235 --> 01:12:13.135
Bless this festival
with your presence

01:12:13.137 --> 01:12:15.071
and purify everything
it touches.

01:12:15.073 --> 01:12:16.037
No!

01:12:19.177 --> 01:12:20.842
Is that all the flesh?

01:12:20.844 --> 01:12:22.878
The rest of it
is in the basement.

01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:26.950
It's almost midnight and
you'll never find the key.

01:12:28.318 --> 01:12:29.784
You mean this key?

01:12:29.786 --> 01:12:31.885
Fools do you
realize the flesh...

01:12:31.887 --> 01:12:32.853
- Josh!
- You must be...

01:12:45.801 --> 01:12:47.700
What did I just do?

01:12:47.702 --> 01:12:49.103
He's one of them.

01:12:49.105 --> 01:12:50.736
You did what you had to do.

01:12:50.738 --> 01:12:51.939
Listen it's almost midnight man.

01:12:51.941 --> 01:12:56.345
We've gotta to the basement
and get the rest of that flesh.

01:12:59.181 --> 01:13:02.351
Hey, I got it, I
got it right here.

01:13:09.924 --> 01:13:11.159
Give me the tank.

01:13:26.174 --> 01:13:27.075
I found it.

01:14:20.392 --> 01:14:21.226
No!

01:15:13.841 --> 01:15:17.043
I'm not afraid of you anymore.

01:16:12.231 --> 01:16:14.031
What?

01:16:16.067 --> 01:16:16.899
Sam!

01:16:17.536 --> 01:16:18.370
Sam, Sam!

01:16:20.939 --> 01:16:22.205
Is he dead?

01:16:22.207 --> 01:16:24.208
Yeah, he's, he's dead.

01:16:25.410 --> 01:16:26.942
What about the flesh?

01:16:26.944 --> 01:16:27.945
It's done.

01:16:29.113 --> 01:16:31.317
I think I found
the hole to hell.

01:16:32.617 --> 01:16:34.250
We gotta go come on.

01:16:34.252 --> 01:16:35.987
Come on, we gotta go.

01:16:41.526 --> 01:16:42.625
Come on!

01:16:42.627 --> 01:16:43.461
Come on.

01:16:52.603 --> 01:16:54.971
Wait, what's that smell?

01:16:57.174 --> 01:16:58.673
Dude, the barn's on fire.

01:16:58.675 --> 01:16:59.674
You gotta
be kidding me,

01:16:59.676 --> 01:17:01.109
there's gotta be
another way out.

01:17:11.587 --> 01:17:13.387
You gotta be kidding me.

01:17:13.389 --> 01:17:16.292
There's no doors,
there's no windows.

01:17:33.709 --> 01:17:37.276
It's over Josh,
there's no way out.

01:18:04.304 --> 01:18:05.472
Hey Boogeyman.

01:18:10.977 --> 01:18:12.546
Trick or treat bitch.

01:18:15.481 --> 01:18:17.348
It's over.

01:18:17.350 --> 01:18:18.317
We stopped it.

01:18:22.689 --> 01:18:24.522
So no more feeding?

01:18:24.524 --> 01:18:26.256
No more feeding.

01:18:26.258 --> 01:18:29.562
But we still gotta
find a way out of here.

01:18:35.467 --> 01:18:36.301
Oh, Sam.

01:18:39.404 --> 01:18:41.440
I think I need to sit down.

01:18:44.009 --> 01:18:45.343
Okay, come on.

01:18:55.553 --> 01:18:56.718
Michelle went to go find help.

01:18:56.720 --> 01:18:59.054
Someone will come for us.

01:19:04.595 --> 01:19:08.430
You know, if we make
it out of here alive,

01:19:08.432 --> 01:19:12.300
I don't think I'm gonna go
trick or treating again.

01:19:12.302 --> 01:19:13.503
Yeah me either.

01:19:21.377 --> 01:19:22.677
Hmm, I actually think I might

01:19:22.679 --> 01:19:25.613
start going back to
Church on Sunday.

01:19:33.423 --> 01:19:34.724
What time is it?

01:19:36.091 --> 01:19:37.424
It's 11:59.

01:19:37.426 --> 01:19:38.492
I thought you said it was over.

01:19:38.494 --> 01:19:42.331
We followed all your rules
Sam, what's going on?

01:19:43.331 --> 01:19:46.333
We're not done yet.

01:19:51.572 --> 01:19:52.438
The flesh was the devil's treat

01:19:52.440 --> 01:19:55.509
in return for the
town's harvest.

01:19:55.511 --> 01:19:57.511
We tricked the treat.

01:19:57.513 --> 01:19:59.580
We broke the Golden Rule.

01:20:14.428 --> 01:20:19.032
So, you think we'll still
be legends after tonight?

01:20:20.567 --> 01:20:23.535
Yeah, but with our luck they'll
probably just remember us

01:20:23.537 --> 01:20:26.504
