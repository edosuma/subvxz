Bloomin' Nora!
Where'd you come from?

01:17.079 --> 01:19.200
The Presbytery.

01:19.200 --> 01:21.799
Before that, a rather
delicious afternoon tea with

01:21.799 --> 01:25.039
Mr and Mrs Granforth,
although I confess to eating

01:25.039 --> 01:27.239
more than one custard tart.

01:27.239 --> 01:29.359
I don't know what you think
you're doing here,

01:29.359 --> 01:32.159
but this is private property.
I know.

01:32.159 --> 01:33.599
I saw the sign.

01:34.640 --> 01:36.759
However, I was invited.

01:36.759 --> 01:39.799
By telephone,
to hear confession.

01:39.799 --> 01:43.319
I thought, perhaps, someone
had taken up residence.

01:44.400 --> 01:47.000
Hardly likely,
considering what happened here.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.319
Mm.

01:48.319 --> 01:52.159
They give you a name,
this mysterious penitent of yours?

01:52.159 --> 01:54.799
Not something I would
usually divulge.

01:54.799 --> 01:59.039
Well, that's a pity, because
I also received a phone call.

01:59.039 --> 02:00.200
Anonymous.

02:00.200 --> 02:01.920
Asked me to come here.

02:01.920 --> 02:05.319
Claimed he had new information
about the Haggard murders.

02:05.319 --> 02:07.000
How intriguing!

02:07.000 --> 02:09.520
A load of horse manure, more like.

02:09.520 --> 02:12.199
I suspected it was
a hoax at the time.

02:12.199 --> 02:14.000
Now I see you here,
I'm certain of it.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.240
I'm off home before
my chops get cold!

02:16.240 --> 02:18.120
Should we not wait?

02:18.120 --> 02:21.680
Perhaps our mutual friend
has merely been delayed.

02:21.680 --> 02:23.719
Take a look around you, Padre.

02:23.719 --> 02:26.039
No-one's set foot in here for
years.

02:26.039 --> 02:27.560
But stay if you wish.

02:27.560 --> 02:31.639
You can entertain the spiders
with your latest sermon.

02:31.639 --> 02:36.199
If no-one's been here for years,
Inspector, who wound the clock?

03:42.960 --> 03:44.800
Mornin'!

03:49.280 --> 03:52.240
Guess I'm not the only sinner
to 'ave caught a few winks

03:52.240 --> 03:53.960
in the shadow of angels!

03:57.560 --> 03:59.479
All right there, lad?

04:17.959 --> 04:20.519
Right, set up a cordon.

04:20.519 --> 04:23.680
I don't want members of the public
traipsing all over the churchyard.

04:23.680 --> 04:25.480
Yes, sir. Constable Hart?

04:27.519 --> 04:30.040
Pop over to Inspector Mallory's.

04:30.040 --> 04:31.639
I think he might have overslept.

04:31.639 --> 04:34.120
Tell him we need him here
straight away. Yes, sir.

04:37.959 --> 04:42.079
You don't expect it, do you?
Right on God's doorstep.

04:42.079 --> 04:44.560
Have you any idea who he was?

04:44.560 --> 04:46.040
Not yet.

04:46.040 --> 04:48.040
His face rings a bell, mind,

04:48.040 --> 04:50.800
but I just can't put my finger
on where I might've seen him.

04:50.800 --> 04:55.480
Do you know what upsets me the most?
It was so preventable.

04:55.480 --> 04:59.519
Any vagrant in such dire need
of help had only to knock at the

04:59.519 --> 05:02.519
Presbytery door and
they'd have been offered a nice,

05:02.519 --> 05:05.800
hot bowl of soup at the very least.

05:05.800 --> 05:08.920
Talking of vagrants,
guess who found him.

05:11.839 --> 05:14.680
May I say you're lookin'
as comely as the cornflowers

05:14.680 --> 05:16.519
on the common, Mrs McCarthy.

05:16.519 --> 05:18.600
Mr Slow.

05:18.600 --> 05:21.120
I suspect the deceased gentleman's
problems went beyond where

05:21.120 --> 05:23.199
his next meal was coming from.

05:23.199 --> 05:25.959
We found an empty bottle
of barbiturates by the body.

05:25.959 --> 05:30.000
He poisoned himself?
And on consecrated ground!

05:30.000 --> 05:32.600
We mustn't jump to conclusions,
Mrs McCarthy.

05:32.600 --> 05:35.279
Could've been an
accidental overdose.

05:35.279 --> 05:38.199
Judging by the cut of him,
I'll wager it was the final,

05:38.199 --> 05:40.120
foolish act of a desperate man.

05:40.120 --> 05:42.840
Mrs M! I thought you you'd gone
to find Father Brown?

05:42.840 --> 05:44.159
Well, that's just it.

05:44.159 --> 05:46.800
He wasn't in his study, I couldn't
find him anywhere else either.

05:46.800 --> 05:48.319
That's odd.

05:48.319 --> 05:51.159
We've had a few problems
locating Inspector Mallory too.

05:51.159 --> 05:53.159
No-one's seen him all morning.

05:56.360 --> 05:59.240
No doubt he's visiting
one of his flock.

05:59.240 --> 06:01.279
Or perhaps he's gone fishing.

06:02.240 --> 06:03.560
Gone fishing?!

06:03.560 --> 06:08.000
Father Brown wouldn't know one end
of the fishing rod from the other.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.399
Still, it's very unlike him
to disappear like that

06:11.399 --> 06:13.759
without saying something to me
first.

06:13.759 --> 06:17.600
According to this,
he has no appointments this morning,

06:17.600 --> 06:20.519
and last entry was yesterday.

06:20.519 --> 06:23.759
"Noon. Confession. Spencer H."

06:23.759 --> 06:26.360
That is Father Brown's
private diary!

06:27.560 --> 06:28.720
Who's Spencer H?

06:29.800 --> 06:31.600
I have absolutely no idea.

06:33.159 --> 06:38.399
I can't recall anyone in Kembleford
with the Christian name of Spencer.

06:38.399 --> 06:42.959
Well, perhaps he went to find
this Spencer fellow,

06:42.959 --> 06:44.199
it got late,

06:44.199 --> 06:47.600
so they offered Father Brown
a bed for the night

06:47.600 --> 06:49.800
and he's still there
tucking into breakfast.

06:49.800 --> 06:51.199
Mystery solved.

06:51.199 --> 06:55.560
Except, clever clogs,
that appointment was for noon.

06:55.560 --> 06:58.959
Now, unless Father Brown was giving
swift to Jack the Ripper,

06:58.959 --> 07:02.120
it wouldn't have taken
until nightfall, would it?

07:02.120 --> 07:04.639
Well, I still think we should find
this Spencer chap and ask him

07:04.639 --> 07:06.839
if Father Brown mentioned
where he was headed.

07:06.839 --> 07:09.639
And how exactly do you
propose we do that?

07:09.639 --> 07:13.600
Well, you have access to the church
register, haven't you?

07:46.519 --> 07:47.680
What a waste of time!

07:47.680 --> 07:51.199
Who knew Kembleford had such a
disconcerting deficit of Spencers?

07:51.199 --> 07:54.120
Mrs McCarthy!
I'm sorry, Mr Slow.

07:54.120 --> 07:56.639
I 'eard you was on the
hunt for the good Father?

07:56.639 --> 07:58.000
Do you know where he is?

07:58.000 --> 07:59.399
Well, not as such.

07:59.399 --> 08:01.560
Then, we must bid you good day.

08:01.560 --> 08:04.199
Unless you know anyone called
Spencer who has a surname

08:04.199 --> 08:06.839
beginning with H?
I knew a Spencer in the Army.

08:06.839 --> 08:08.560
Corporal in the Royal Engineers.

08:08.560 --> 08:10.040
But he was a Pratt.

08:10.040 --> 08:12.160
I mean, his surname was Pratt,
which doesn't begin...

08:12.160 --> 08:13.360
Goodbye, Mr Slow.

08:14.360 --> 08:16.959
But I did see 'im, the Father.

08:16.959 --> 08:18.240
Where?

08:18.240 --> 08:19.560
Here.

08:19.560 --> 08:22.160
Yesterday, late afternoon.
Six-ish.

08:22.160 --> 08:24.439
No clue where 'e was trundlin'
off to, mind.

08:24.439 --> 08:27.240
BICYCLE BELL TINGS
Evenin', Father!

08:27.240 --> 08:29.920
I remember cos he
usually stops for a chat,

08:29.920 --> 08:32.960
only he looked like
he was in a hurry.

08:32.960 --> 08:35.759
Anyway, I'm off to the Red Lion, but
if I sees 'im, I'll come find you.

08:35.759 --> 08:37.320
Most kind.

08:37.320 --> 08:41.200
Only man of the cloth worth
the leather of my shoe!

08:41.200 --> 08:43.600
So, perhaps this confession
was postponed

08:43.600 --> 08:45.120
until later in the evening.

08:45.120 --> 08:47.320
Don't suppose Father Brown
has turned up yet?

08:47.320 --> 08:49.320
Sadly not.

08:49.320 --> 08:50.639
Only, according to his wife,

08:50.639 --> 08:52.600
Inspector Mallory didn't make it
home last night.

08:52.600 --> 08:56.000
Desk Sergeant said the Inspector
got a call around six.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.039
Sir?

09:04.840 --> 09:06.360
Inspector Mallory speaking.

09:07.480 --> 09:10.120
Actually, I was just on my way home,
so if this could wait...

09:12.279 --> 09:13.759
Is that so?

09:16.679 --> 09:19.840
Why don't you come
to the station and...

09:21.639 --> 09:23.080
All right, calm down.

09:24.399 --> 09:25.879
Where do you want to meet?

09:28.399 --> 09:30.120
Give me 20 minutes.

09:33.600 --> 09:36.559
I need the file on the Haggard
murders, quick as you can.

09:40.840 --> 09:42.320
Left soon afterwards.

09:42.320 --> 09:44.159
That was the last time anyone
saw him.

09:44.159 --> 09:47.200
Sounds like he was looking
into that old Haggard case.

09:47.200 --> 09:50.279
That poor couple murdered
in their bed? Exactly.

09:50.279 --> 09:52.480
George and Jasmin Haggard?

09:52.480 --> 09:55.279
That's them. I thought that
was before your time here?

09:55.279 --> 09:56.919
It was.

09:56.919 --> 09:59.279
Isn't that where Blind 'Arry
found the body this morning?

09:59.279 --> 10:01.320
I suppose I should've spotted that.

10:01.320 --> 10:03.200
You won't tell the Inspector,
will you?

10:03.200 --> 10:05.799
Oh, your secret is safe with us,
Sergeant.

10:05.799 --> 10:08.240
Horrible business, it was, horrible.

10:08.240 --> 10:10.840
My kids still won't go down the lane
past Spencer Hall.

10:10.840 --> 10:12.399
Spencer Hall?

10:12.399 --> 10:15.200
The Haggards' house,
just outside of town.

10:15.200 --> 10:16.639
Here.

10:22.559 --> 10:24.879
And the murderer's name
was Edmund Noon?

10:24.879 --> 10:27.080
That's right.
He was never caught.

10:27.080 --> 10:29.440
It was like he vanished
into thin air.

10:29.440 --> 10:33.399
So Father Brown wasn't going to meet
Spencer H for confession at noon.

10:33.399 --> 10:37.159
He was going to Spencer Hall to hear
the confession of Edmund Noon,

10:37.159 --> 10:39.360
a known murderer!

10:41.519 --> 10:43.480
And no-one has seen him since!

10:47.960 --> 10:50.399
Police surgeon reckons
the body fits the age

10:50.399 --> 10:52.480
and physical description
of Edmund Noon.

10:52.480 --> 10:54.600
All right, so...

10:54.600 --> 10:58.879
Wracked with guilt, Edmund Noon
returns to Kembleford, confesses,

10:58.879 --> 11:00.840
seeks forgiveness
at the Haggards' grave,

11:00.840 --> 11:02.720
and then kills himself.

11:02.720 --> 11:05.600
But that still doesn't explain
what has happened to Father Brown!

11:05.600 --> 11:07.080
Or Inspector Mallory.

11:07.080 --> 11:09.240
Or Inspector Mallory.

11:09.240 --> 11:11.360
I reckon I should go to
Spencer Hall, have a peek around,

11:11.360 --> 11:13.320
see what I can find.
Great! We'll come with you.

11:13.320 --> 11:14.720
I don't think that's a very good...

11:14.720 --> 11:16.519
We'll take my car.
It'll be quicker.

11:16.519 --> 11:18.080
Well, it makes sense, I suppose.

11:18.080 --> 11:21.759
Between you and me, I've always
dreamed of taking her for a spin.

11:21.759 --> 11:23.919
I beg your pardon!

11:23.919 --> 11:25.720
I meant the car!

11:31.559 --> 11:33.919
This is strange.

11:33.919 --> 11:36.840
Why? I thought you said
nobody was living here.

11:36.840 --> 11:40.240
Well, not since the murders,
but this padlock looks brand-new.

11:42.519 --> 11:44.919
Not to worry,
we can climb over the wall.

11:44.919 --> 11:49.879
Penelope,
couldn't you just pick the lock?

11:49.879 --> 11:53.320
Firstly, that lock is a little
beyond my level of expertise

11:53.320 --> 11:56.159
and, secondly, there are certain
things a lady shouldn't do

11:56.159 --> 11:57.799
in front of an officer of the law.

11:57.799 --> 12:01.200
But I'm sure the Sergeant
will give you a leg-up!

12:15.639 --> 12:17.159
Anyone here?

12:20.759 --> 12:24.000
It don't think anyone's been here
in a long time.

12:26.639 --> 12:28.159
I'm not so sure.

12:31.600 --> 12:33.320
Look at this grass.

12:33.320 --> 12:36.600
This footprint can't be more
than a day old.

12:36.600 --> 12:39.919
I reckon we should have
a proper look around.

12:41.399 --> 12:44.399
So what do we know about this
Edmund Noon character, anyway?

12:44.399 --> 12:46.799
Besides him being
a double-murderer.

12:46.799 --> 12:50.080
As far as I can recall,
he was a schoolteacher

12:50.080 --> 12:53.000
from Hambleston, I think.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.480
That's right.

12:54.480 --> 12:58.480
He got a job improving
the young Mrs Haggard's education.

12:58.480 --> 13:00.519
Only thing is, he fell for her.

13:02.360 --> 13:08.399
"We saw it...in each other's...eye,

13:08.399 --> 13:13.080
"and wished...in every...

13:15.799 --> 13:23.000
"..every half-breathed sigh...
to speak, but did not.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.879
"She felt..."

13:26.639 --> 13:28.200
Go on.

13:28.200 --> 13:30.080
You're doing very well.

13:32.840 --> 13:35.039
"She felt...

13:35.039 --> 13:39.799
"my lips'...impassioned touch.

13:41.320 --> 13:45.600
"Twas the first time
I dared so much.

13:45.600 --> 13:49.279
"And yet she chid not."

13:53.440 --> 13:56.799
Unfortunately, George Haggard
discovered that Edmund had

13:56.799 --> 13:58.679
feelings for his young wife.

13:58.679 --> 14:00.080
So what did he do?

14:00.080 --> 14:03.639
Mr Haggard told Jasmin she was
never to see Edmund again.

14:03.639 --> 14:05.200
Nothing has happened!

14:05.200 --> 14:06.799
Yet! I know men like him.

14:06.799 --> 14:09.000
It's only a matter of time!

14:09.000 --> 14:10.639
I would never betray you.

14:10.639 --> 14:12.000
I wish I could believe that.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.799
What can I do to convince
you that...?

14:13.799 --> 14:16.039
You can tell him he is
no longer welcome here!

14:16.039 --> 14:18.399
But my lessons!
Forget your lessons!

14:18.399 --> 14:22.679
When I found you, your village was
burning, your parents were dead.

14:22.679 --> 14:25.480
You were half-starved. Remember?

14:25.480 --> 14:27.440
And whose fault was that?

14:28.960 --> 14:30.720
What did you say?

14:32.000 --> 14:35.200
It was your country!
Your politicians!

14:35.200 --> 14:36.720
Your soldiers!

14:38.000 --> 14:42.120
I saved your life! Is that not
enough to earn some obedience?!

14:47.080 --> 14:50.879
When Edmund Noon got the telephone
call informing him he was

14:50.879 --> 14:52.639
no longer welcome at the house,

14:52.639 --> 14:55.240
by all accounts,
he flew into a jealous rage,

14:55.240 --> 14:57.600
and came straight here and then he,

14:57.600 --> 15:01.840
well, you both know
the end of that sad story.

15:02.960 --> 15:04.639
Were there any witnesses?

15:04.639 --> 15:06.480
The housekeeper.

15:06.480 --> 15:07.879
Patricia Wintham.

15:07.879 --> 15:10.360
Mr Haggard! It's Mrs Wintham!

15:10.360 --> 15:13.559
I was just going to give your
mirrors a wipe. You in there?

15:16.000 --> 15:18.519
SHE GASPS AND SCREAMS

15:20.679 --> 15:24.960
By the time we got here to arrest Mr
Noon, he'd already gone on the run.

15:24.960 --> 15:28.840
But we found the gun dumped
in a ditch near his house.

15:28.840 --> 15:31.159
Look! Look at this.

15:32.399 --> 15:34.559
Housekeeping services.

15:34.559 --> 15:38.240
"Mrs Wintham, Priory Lane,
Kembleford."

15:38.240 --> 15:41.600
So the Haggards got their
housekeeper from the local rag.

15:41.600 --> 15:43.799
That is last week's paper.

15:43.799 --> 15:48.120
Whoever circled that advertisement,
it certainly wasn't the Haggards.

15:50.639 --> 15:53.000
Somebody was looking for her.
Exactly.

15:59.720 --> 16:03.960
Maybe this Edmund Noon blamed the
housekeeper for what happened?

16:03.960 --> 16:07.240
After all, it sounds like she was
the one that spilled the beans

16:07.240 --> 16:08.679
to the husband.

16:08.679 --> 16:11.679
Not that I'm saying
it was her fault.

16:11.679 --> 16:15.120
That would be mere speculation,
gossip, if you like.

16:16.279 --> 16:19.200
Let's get her side of the story
before we jump to conclusions,

16:19.200 --> 16:21.039
shall we?

16:31.720 --> 16:33.559
Stay here.

16:41.600 --> 16:43.159
Oh, dear.

16:43.159 --> 16:45.240
It's not exactly
a good advertisement

16:45.240 --> 16:46.840
for her housekeeping skills!

16:50.840 --> 16:54.080
Looks like we've now got
three missing persons.

17:01.000 --> 17:06.160
Sergeant, we have just spoken
to Mrs Wintham's neighbours.

17:07.279 --> 17:09.839
She hasn't been seen
for a couple of days.

17:09.839 --> 17:12.279
Perhaps Father Brown
discovered she was missing

17:12.279 --> 17:14.519
and went to look for her.

17:14.519 --> 17:17.319
There's something else
you should know.

17:17.319 --> 17:19.640
One of my constables
just told me that, last week,

17:19.640 --> 17:21.960
Patricia Wintham telephoned
the police station.

17:21.960 --> 17:23.920
She'd received a threatening letter.

17:23.920 --> 17:27.000
The Desk Sergeant on duty convinced
her it was probably a prank

17:27.000 --> 17:28.200
but then...

17:28.200 --> 17:30.480
..we found this in her bedroom.

17:30.480 --> 17:33.640
If it is from Edmund Noon, you're
probably right, Mrs McCarthy.

17:33.640 --> 17:36.759
He came back to Kembleford
with a score to settle.

17:36.759 --> 17:40.000
"Death's icy touch lies in store."

17:50.200 --> 17:52.319
Inspector Mallory speaking.

17:54.720 --> 17:56.519
Death's icy what?

17:56.519 --> 17:58.519
You heard.

17:58.519 --> 18:00.119
Who is this?

18:00.119 --> 18:02.200
Haven't you figured it out yet?

18:03.240 --> 18:05.039
Noon?

18:05.039 --> 18:07.880
You killed the love of my life.

18:07.880 --> 18:09.599
Now it's your turn to suffer.

18:09.599 --> 18:11.000
Wait a minute, lad.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.880
You're the murderer here, not me!

18:12.880 --> 18:16.119
I haven't killed anyone.
Yet.

18:16.119 --> 18:18.759
So those bullet-holes
spontaneously erupted

18:18.759 --> 18:20.440
in Mr and Mrs Haggard, did they?

18:20.440 --> 18:22.640
They were already dead
when I got there.

18:22.640 --> 18:24.640
Jasmin called me.

18:24.640 --> 18:26.640
She was terrified.

18:33.440 --> 18:38.119
It's me. He knows. That evil-minded
housekeeper told him.

18:38.119 --> 18:39.759
Please, you've got to come.

18:39.759 --> 18:42.359
We'll go away somewhere.
I love you!

18:45.200 --> 18:47.880
I went to the house to protect
Jasmin, not to kill her.

18:51.640 --> 18:55.880
I got there as fast as I could,
but I was too late.

18:57.559 --> 18:58.720
Jasmin?

19:04.640 --> 19:06.359
Jasmin?

19:06.359 --> 19:08.119
It's me, Edmund.

19:10.240 --> 19:11.400
Hey.

19:19.960 --> 19:21.000
Jasmin?

19:23.319 --> 19:25.279
Open your eyes!

19:25.279 --> 19:27.400
Open your eyes, Jasmin!

19:48.519 --> 19:51.039
Mr Haggard? It's Mrs Wintham.

19:51.039 --> 19:53.880
I was going to give your mirrors
a wipe down. You in there?

19:58.640 --> 20:03.119
I knew what it looked like, I knew
that nobody would ever believe me,

20:03.119 --> 20:04.960
so I ran.

20:04.960 --> 20:08.079
I've spent the last two years
on the run,

20:08.079 --> 20:10.720
moving from place to place,
always looking over my shoulder.

20:10.720 --> 20:12.480
I'm not doing it any more.

20:12.480 --> 20:14.480
It's time for...

20:14.480 --> 20:16.039
Resolution.

20:16.039 --> 20:17.680
Don't you mean revenge?

20:20.559 --> 20:22.440
Oh, Father, you made it.

20:22.440 --> 20:24.960
Yes, I suppose I do mean revenge.

20:24.960 --> 20:26.319
Against whom?

20:26.319 --> 20:29.000
George Haggard may have robbed me
of the chance to kill him, but at

20:29.000 --> 20:31.720
least I can punish those
who contributed to Jasmin's death.

20:31.720 --> 20:33.279
Including both of you.

20:35.279 --> 20:36.920
It's got nothing to do with me!

20:36.920 --> 20:39.200
You're the Inspector, aren't you?

20:39.200 --> 20:41.720
According to the newspapers,
you ignored reports of a woman's

20:41.720 --> 20:44.119
cries coming from Spencer Hall
on the night of the murder.

20:44.119 --> 20:46.799
Said it wasn't your job to
interfere in domestic disputes!

20:46.799 --> 20:49.200
I wasn't even in
Kembleford back then!

20:49.200 --> 20:51.240
Must have been one of my
predecessors so...

20:51.240 --> 20:53.319
That makes no difference.

20:53.319 --> 20:55.279
The police left her to die.

20:55.279 --> 20:56.680
The police will pay.

20:57.720 --> 21:03.759
As for you, Father, I read
all about the diary they found.

21:03.759 --> 21:05.599
What diary?

21:05.599 --> 21:07.319
Mr Haggard's.

21:07.319 --> 21:11.519
He wrote of visiting his priest
for confession that very morning,

21:11.519 --> 21:15.559
sharing his doubts
about his wife's fidelity.

21:15.559 --> 21:18.359
Even if that were true,
I don't see how I...

21:18.359 --> 21:21.079
You could have warned her
of her husband's anger, but instead

21:21.079 --> 21:23.599
you did nothing while
he went home and killed her!

21:23.599 --> 21:27.599
Mr Noon, I understand you have
suffered a terrible loss, but...

21:29.000 --> 21:30.559
You understand nothing!

21:33.279 --> 21:35.759
But to prove I am no monster,

21:35.759 --> 21:39.200
I'll give you a chance
to redeem yourselves.

21:42.039 --> 21:44.079
We're going to play a game.

21:44.079 --> 21:47.920
Now, I've captured Patricia Wintham
and I've hidden her somewhere

21:47.920 --> 21:49.880
within the boundaries
of Spencer Hall.

21:49.880 --> 21:52.359
Find her before sundown
and I'll let you live.

21:52.359 --> 21:56.559
But if you fail, or call for help,
or try to leave the grounds...

21:58.960 --> 22:00.279
..I'll kill you all.

22:12.039 --> 22:14.960
We'd better start looking
for Mrs Wintham.

22:27.599 --> 22:28.960
No luck.

22:28.960 --> 22:32.960
I've searched everywhere,
the basement, the attic,

22:32.960 --> 22:34.880
and you're sat on your backside.

22:38.920 --> 22:41.960
"Death's icy touch lies in store."

22:41.960 --> 22:44.640
That's what the toe-rag
said on the phone.

22:44.640 --> 22:46.759
It must mean something.

22:46.759 --> 22:49.319
It means somebody's in for it.

22:49.319 --> 22:51.680
And I'm starting to worry
it might be us!

22:57.960 --> 23:00.240
I think he's given us a clue.

23:00.240 --> 23:01.720
And why would he do that?

23:01.720 --> 23:04.160
As he said, it's a game.
Of sorts.

23:05.160 --> 23:07.440
I'm more of a gin rummy man myself.

23:07.440 --> 23:08.920
"Lies in store."

23:08.920 --> 23:11.559
Perhaps he's referring
to an outbuilding within the

23:11.559 --> 23:13.440
boundaries of Spencer Hall.

23:13.440 --> 23:15.160
Like a shed, you mean? Yes.

23:16.240 --> 23:18.440
Well, let's split up.
It'll be quicker.

23:18.440 --> 23:20.000
Righty-ho, Inspector.

23:21.599 --> 23:23.720
And that way, I can get
some peace and quiet.

23:26.000 --> 23:29.039
CLATTER
Mrs Wintham?

23:35.160 --> 23:37.240
Pigeons!

23:47.519 --> 23:49.200
This is pointless.

23:49.200 --> 23:51.480
I should call the station, round up
two dozen men and we'll tear

23:51.480 --> 23:54.160
this place apart until we find her.

23:54.160 --> 23:57.880
What about Noon's threat to kill
Mrs Wintham if we do?

23:57.880 --> 23:59.519
Not to mention us.

24:00.559 --> 24:02.359
If he thinks this is a game,

24:02.359 --> 24:06.400
what's to say she isn't dead already
and he's just playing with us?!

24:06.400 --> 24:08.960
Humbug? It will help.

24:10.200 --> 24:12.920
How will a boiled sweet
possibly help?

24:12.920 --> 24:17.519
A sense of comfort combined with
a sugary stimulation to the brain.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.519
No, thank you.

24:25.920 --> 24:28.720
We're running out of time,
it's nearly sundown.

24:28.720 --> 24:31.599
I've had enough of this.
I'm calling for back-up!

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
Inspector.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.640
What's down there?

24:38.720 --> 24:40.759
Some sort of secret tunnel, maybe.

24:42.480 --> 24:45.400
Actually, I think
it's a disused ice house.

24:45.400 --> 24:48.319
Death's icy touch!
Indeed.

24:49.960 --> 24:51.440
After you.

24:52.880 --> 24:54.839
Let his light shine in the darkness.

25:24.759 --> 25:26.240
Thank you, Inspector.

25:35.559 --> 25:37.960
Well?
Mrs Wintham?!

25:39.440 --> 25:41.279
Thank goodness for that.

25:41.279 --> 25:43.079
Let's get her out of here.

25:45.200 --> 25:46.440
Oi!

25:49.279 --> 25:51.440
We had a deal!

25:51.440 --> 25:54.680
I said that if you found her,
I wouldn't kill you.

25:54.680 --> 25:56.759
I didn't say I'd let you go.

25:56.759 --> 25:58.920
We're all mortal, of course.

25:58.920 --> 26:01.200
Who knows how long
any of us have left?

26:01.200 --> 26:04.400
Mr Noon, please, we cannot imagine
what you've been through, but...

26:04.400 --> 26:06.720
Then, try harder.

26:06.720 --> 26:08.680
No-one will find you here.

26:08.680 --> 26:12.039
You can spend your last few hours
scrabbling around in the dark,

26:12.039 --> 26:13.839
thinking about what you did.

26:16.799 --> 26:19.319
Noon! Come back here!

26:19.319 --> 26:22.720
HE BANGS DOOR
Noon!

26:44.880 --> 26:46.359
I'm sorry.

26:48.599 --> 26:50.279
I'm sorry, my love.

26:55.079 --> 27:01.440
That I didn't get there sooner,
that I couldn't stop him.

27:08.480 --> 27:10.400
But it's all over now.

27:18.400 --> 27:20.400
All of it.

27:51.839 --> 27:53.759
We brought in Edmund Noon's mother.

27:53.759 --> 27:56.160
She's made a positive
identification on the body.

27:56.160 --> 27:58.119
And you still think
it was a suicide?

27:58.119 --> 27:59.720
There were no signs of a struggle.

27:59.720 --> 28:01.799
And his prints were the
only ones on the bottle.

28:01.799 --> 28:05.799
Shouldn't our priority be finding
Father Brown and Mrs Wintham?

28:05.799 --> 28:08.000
Yes, yes, and Inspector Mallory.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.160
Yes.

28:09.160 --> 28:12.200
Edmund Noon was clearly a very
dangerous man and we have

28:12.200 --> 28:14.759
good reason to believe that he was
in contact with all three

28:14.759 --> 28:16.480
before their disappearance.

28:16.480 --> 28:19.400
So I think we should go back to
Spencer Hall and look for clues.

28:19.400 --> 28:22.000
Yes, but the thing is,
it's a police matter so...

28:22.000 --> 28:23.160
Oh, don't be obtuse.

28:23.160 --> 28:25.319
You know perfectly well
that you're stuck with us,

28:25.319 --> 28:27.039
so you may as well embrace it.

28:27.039 --> 28:30.160
I don't suppose it matters if we
have two more pairs of eyes

28:30.160 --> 28:33.039
on the case.
That's the spirit!

28:33.039 --> 28:35.880
Mr Slow!
Might I have a word?

28:35.880 --> 28:40.640
My ears and heart are yours
in eternum, Mrs McCarthy.

28:40.640 --> 28:43.079
Yes, well, be that as it may.

28:43.079 --> 28:46.119
Would you be able to keep
an eye out for Father Brown

28:46.119 --> 28:48.400
in case he turns up?
He's still missing?

28:48.400 --> 28:50.240
Yes, yes, I'm afraid he is.

28:50.240 --> 28:52.720
He's got himself stuck somewhere,
I reckon.

28:52.720 --> 28:54.960
Some nippers locked me
in my outhouse once.

28:54.960 --> 28:56.759
I was in there for three days.

28:56.759 --> 28:58.359
That's terrible! You poor thing!

28:58.359 --> 29:00.000
Weren't so bad.

29:00.000 --> 29:03.759
Like being in my dugout in Flanders,
only without the whizz-bangs.

29:03.759 --> 29:08.200
So you just want me to sit here
and wait for him in case

29:08.200 --> 29:10.160
he comes cycling by? Exactly.

29:10.160 --> 29:13.920
For you, Mrs McCarthy,
I'd undertake the labours of

29:13.920 --> 29:17.160
Hercules and ask only
for a smile on yer face.

29:17.160 --> 29:19.519
I insist. Oh.

29:19.519 --> 29:20.839
Well, in that case.

29:23.720 --> 29:25.920
Been meaning to sew up that 'ole!

29:29.920 --> 29:32.640
So what happens
if I see the good Father?

29:32.640 --> 29:36.920
You tell him that we've gone to
Spencer Hall to look for him.

29:36.920 --> 29:39.240
Tough job...

29:39.240 --> 29:40.680
..but...

29:42.319 --> 29:44.920
..some blighter's gotta do it.

29:58.559 --> 30:02.240
You all right, Miss?
It's my fault.

30:02.240 --> 30:04.119
Don't talk soft.

30:04.119 --> 30:05.519
You didn't lock us in here.

30:05.519 --> 30:09.079
No, but I told Mr Haggard
about Edmund and Jasmin.

30:09.079 --> 30:11.240
And if I hadn't,
they'd still be alive.

30:11.240 --> 30:13.680
So why did you tell him?

30:15.200 --> 30:17.000
I was protecting Edmund.

30:18.559 --> 30:20.079
Protecting him?

30:20.079 --> 30:24.079
He was going to throw his life away
for that foolish girl.

30:25.960 --> 30:29.680
And you didn't want him
running away with her,

30:29.680 --> 30:33.200
because you had feelings for him?
I know!

30:33.200 --> 30:38.960
I'm an idiot, I know, and now we
will all pay for my petty jealousy.

30:40.079 --> 30:43.559
You never know.
Maybe he'll come back, let us go.

30:43.559 --> 30:45.279
It's a game, like you said, Padre.

30:47.880 --> 30:50.400
Edmund told me that,
when this was done,

30:50.400 --> 30:52.720
he was going to be with Jasmin.

30:54.680 --> 30:56.160
He's not coming back.

30:58.400 --> 31:01.480
Then I will pray for his poor,
tormented soul.

31:02.640 --> 31:04.640
It's our souls I'm worried about.

31:05.839 --> 31:09.359
I'm sure there are people
looking for us.

31:09.359 --> 31:14.000
And how exactly will they track us
down to this hole in the ground?

31:14.000 --> 31:17.680
We could scream blue murder till
Judgment Day and nobody would hear!

31:17.680 --> 31:21.440
"And I will lead the blind in the
ways which they know not,

31:21.440 --> 31:26.839
"and in the paths which they were
ignorant of, I will make them walk.

31:28.880 --> 31:34.319
"I will make darkness
light before them,

31:34.319 --> 31:35.960
"and crooked things straight."

31:38.759 --> 31:40.960
Anything?
Not a trace. Me neither.

31:40.960 --> 31:42.319
Well, what do we do now?

31:43.240 --> 31:45.160
That muddy footprint you found.

31:45.160 --> 31:47.960
That wouldn't have come from someone
walking down a gravel driveway,

31:47.960 --> 31:50.440
would it? The gardens!

31:54.400 --> 31:55.440
I don't feel well.

31:56.920 --> 31:58.519
So tired.

32:00.359 --> 32:02.599
Miss?

32:02.599 --> 32:05.799
Do you think he drugged her?

32:05.799 --> 32:07.440
Possibly.

32:07.440 --> 32:11.119
But that door would have been
designed to keep out warm air

32:11.119 --> 32:12.480
during the summer months.

32:14.920 --> 32:17.119
Are you saying
we're running out of oxygen?

32:18.960 --> 32:20.839
How long?

32:20.839 --> 32:26.279
Hard to say, but if Mrs Wintham
is already showing symptoms...

32:26.279 --> 32:28.000
Typical!

32:28.000 --> 32:31.480
I've only just renewed my membership
at the golf club.

32:33.759 --> 32:35.759
Any ideas?

32:35.759 --> 32:38.519
Maybe we could dig our way out?

32:38.519 --> 32:40.400
These walls are too thick.

32:40.400 --> 32:43.759
We would waste what little air
we have left.

32:43.759 --> 32:50.000
No, our only choice is to wait and
have faith that God will deliver us.

32:52.599 --> 32:57.359
That would be the same God that
landed us here in the first place?

32:58.319 --> 33:01.079
Perhaps he thought it would be
an opportunity for us

33:01.079 --> 33:03.680
to reconcile our differences.

33:03.680 --> 33:07.599
Tell him from me he's going
to be sorely disappointed!

33:11.559 --> 33:13.519
Where's Penelope?

33:13.519 --> 33:15.599
Still checking the greenhouse,
I think.

33:15.599 --> 33:19.200
Look! I found this dumped behind
the compost heap.

33:19.200 --> 33:21.799
But no sign of its owner,
I'm guessing?

33:21.799 --> 33:23.960
Noon must have taken them
somewhere else?

33:23.960 --> 33:25.279
He would have needed a vehicle,

33:25.279 --> 33:27.960
and I didn't spot any tyre
tracks on that driveway.

33:27.960 --> 33:29.440
Look.

33:32.119 --> 33:34.680
I'd recognise
these humbugs anywhere.

33:34.680 --> 33:37.440
They're from the sweet shop
on Hope Street.

33:37.440 --> 33:40.160
Mrs Penny makes them herself.
So?

33:40.160 --> 33:43.680
I gave Father Brown a packet
only two days ago.

33:43.680 --> 33:47.559
It was a little thank-you
for his help with my WI talk.

33:48.799 --> 33:50.839
Oh, look!

33:50.839 --> 33:53.440
Well, I don't think he liked them
very much.

33:53.440 --> 33:56.240
They are his favourites,
I can assure you!

33:57.359 --> 33:58.680
Well, in that case...

34:00.319 --> 34:04.960
Ah! Another one!
It's a trail of breadcrumbs.

34:04.960 --> 34:07.720
Father Brown must've suspected
something might happen to him.

34:07.720 --> 34:10.679
We'd better find out where they lead
before it's too late!

34:51.159 --> 34:57.639
The Communion wine? You sure?
Very decent of you!

35:13.559 --> 35:17.280
I'd have only nabbed a bottle
or two, honest.

35:24.039 --> 35:25.920
Wait a minute.

35:33.559 --> 35:38.199
Isn't this the bit where you come up
with some ingenious plan

35:38.199 --> 35:40.719
to get us out of here?

35:40.719 --> 35:42.199
Sorry to disappoint.

35:46.000 --> 35:47.480
In that case, Padre...

35:49.440 --> 35:51.480
..about what you said earlier -

35:51.480 --> 35:54.239
reconciling differences,
and all that.

35:57.320 --> 35:59.079
I know that you and I

35:59.079 --> 36:03.760
haven't always sung from the
same hymn sheet, as it were.

36:05.440 --> 36:07.079
And I've said things...

36:09.400 --> 36:11.639
..behind your back...

36:11.639 --> 36:14.000
and to your face, for that matter.

36:17.119 --> 36:21.480
Things that weren't always
entirely complimentary.

36:24.519 --> 36:26.559
I just want you to know that...

36:28.920 --> 36:33.800
..I meant every bloomin' word!

36:39.119 --> 36:42.159
We've looked everywhere,
the trail's gone cold.

36:42.159 --> 36:44.000
Well, we can't just give up.

36:46.480 --> 36:47.880
There's one!

36:49.559 --> 36:51.960
Well done, Mrs McCarthy.

36:51.960 --> 36:55.079
What do you have in your mouth?
Nothing.

36:55.079 --> 36:58.679
Have you been eating the humbugs?
Just the one.

36:58.679 --> 37:00.800
Words fail me, Sergeant.

37:00.800 --> 37:02.519
What's that down there?

37:02.519 --> 37:05.440
Oh, I think it's an ice-house,
we've got one at Montague.

37:05.440 --> 37:07.639
Aunt Fliss keeps her champagne
in it.

37:07.639 --> 37:09.559
That is, until I found the key.

37:09.559 --> 37:11.840
You don't think that they've...

37:18.320 --> 37:19.840
Anyone in there?

37:21.639 --> 37:23.199
Inspector?

37:24.960 --> 37:27.519
Father? Can you hear us?

37:38.079 --> 37:40.559
There's no-one there.

37:40.559 --> 37:45.199
You were right, Penelope - Noon must
have moved them somewhere else.

37:45.199 --> 37:48.159
Then I suggest we return
to the police station,

37:48.159 --> 37:50.679
put out an official alert.

37:50.679 --> 37:53.599
What's HE doing here?
Mrs McCarthy?

37:53.599 --> 37:56.000
So much for keeping an eye out
for Father Brown!

37:56.000 --> 37:58.480
I have a good mind to ask
for my money back.

37:58.480 --> 38:01.280
Don't you be getting yerself
in a tizzle, Mrs McCarthy.

38:01.280 --> 38:04.400
I only left my post because
you three traipsed off to this

38:04.400 --> 38:10.599
fine abode, but left the key on the
blessed soil of St Mary's.

38:10.599 --> 38:14.960
The key? What? I have no idea what
you are talking about.

38:14.960 --> 38:17.559
Wait, you found a key?

38:17.559 --> 38:20.159
Right next to where the lad's body
was found.

38:20.159 --> 38:21.880
Got it right here. Oh.

38:23.039 --> 38:24.599
At least I did.

38:28.760 --> 38:30.559
Must've slipped through that 'ole.

38:30.559 --> 38:33.960
I despair of you,
Harold Slow, I truly do!

38:33.960 --> 38:38.079
Father! Come on, answer me!

38:44.079 --> 38:48.039
Bunty? Is that you?

38:48.039 --> 38:52.880
Tell us how we can get you out
of there? The key.

38:52.880 --> 38:54.800
We might have a problem there,
Father.

38:54.800 --> 38:56.960
I am so sorry, Father.

38:56.960 --> 38:58.199
I've let you down.

38:59.199 --> 39:02.360
Harold! My old friend.

39:05.960 --> 39:07.719
Harold!

39:10.320 --> 39:12.320
Look in the workshop!

39:15.480 --> 39:16.840
Be quick.

39:16.840 --> 39:18.159
HE HYPERVENTILATES

39:19.280 --> 39:21.000
Workshop? What workshop?

39:22.000 --> 39:24.920
Father! Father, stay awake!

39:24.920 --> 39:27.159
Maybe there's a spare key in the
workshop.

39:27.159 --> 39:28.719
I'll go with Harold to check.

39:28.719 --> 39:31.400
No. No.
You stay with Father Brown.

39:32.679 --> 39:34.639
Fancy a bit of my company, Mrs M?

39:34.639 --> 39:36.480
Somebody needs to keep an eye
on you!

39:41.280 --> 39:43.639
SHE SIGHS
It must be here somewhere.

39:43.639 --> 39:47.360
Harold Slow,
would you at least make an effort?!

39:48.280 --> 39:51.840
They call me Blind 'Arry
cos of what the gas did to my eyes.

39:51.840 --> 39:56.199
Oh, there was me thinking it's
because you're always blind drunk.

39:56.199 --> 39:59.639
That too. So the Father wouldn't
have sent me here

39:59.639 --> 40:00.880
to hunt for a key.

40:00.880 --> 40:02.840
He'd have sent one of you lot,
wouldn't he?

40:02.840 --> 40:06.480
Well, you're here now, so could you
please help me look?

40:06.480 --> 40:09.119
No, I'm thinking something
different, see.

40:09.119 --> 40:14.199
I'm thinking he sent me here cos
he knows I was a sapper in the war.

40:14.199 --> 40:17.000
What are you gibbering on about now?

40:17.000 --> 40:19.199
Means I know how to blow stuff up.

40:27.880 --> 40:32.199
I just want to say, for the record,
I think this is a terrible idea,

40:32.199 --> 40:37.079
It'll be a miracle if that man
doesn't blow us all to smithereens -

40:37.079 --> 40:40.480
Father Brown
and Inspector Mallory included.

40:42.000 --> 40:43.760
Come now, Mrs McCarthy.

40:43.760 --> 40:46.400
If Father Brown has taught me
one thing,

40:46.400 --> 40:48.360
it's that we should believe
in miracles.

40:48.360 --> 40:50.360
You might wanna cover yer...
EXPLOSION

40:52.280 --> 40:54.079
EXPLOSION

41:01.159 --> 41:06.679
SINGLE HIGH-PITCHED TONE

41:06.679 --> 41:08.920
TONE FADES

41:10.199 --> 41:12.440
BIRDSONG

41:14.400 --> 41:16.199
HE LAUGHS

41:18.159 --> 41:19.760
FOOTSTEPS

41:26.639 --> 41:28.519
Mother, is that you?

41:28.519 --> 41:30.599
It's only me, Inspector. Only me.

41:30.599 --> 41:33.079
HEAVY BREATHING

41:33.079 --> 41:35.960
Father, please. Wake up.

41:35.960 --> 41:37.920
Slap him.

41:37.920 --> 41:40.440
I beg your pardon? Slap him!

41:40.440 --> 41:43.679
I will NOT slap a priest!
Fine, then - I'll do it.

41:43.679 --> 41:46.760
SHE INHALES
I can't do it!

41:46.760 --> 41:48.519
You don't think that he's...?

41:48.519 --> 41:50.039
SHE SIGHS

41:50.039 --> 41:52.719
Oh, for heaven's sake, Father!
Enough of this silliness.

41:52.719 --> 41:54.320
We need you to wake up!

41:54.320 --> 41:55.360
HE GASPS

41:56.599 --> 41:58.079
Oh!

41:58.079 --> 42:01.320
HE GASPS

42:01.320 --> 42:03.880
Are you sure you won't stay?

42:03.880 --> 42:06.400
There's plenty to go around.

42:06.400 --> 42:08.960
I should be getting back
to the family. Same here.

42:08.960 --> 42:12.880
And, to be honest, I think
Father Brown and I have spent more

42:12.880 --> 42:15.440
than enough time
in each other's company for one day.

42:15.440 --> 42:20.000
The Sergeant and I just wanted
to stop by and...you know.

42:20.000 --> 42:22.159
You are most welcome, Inspector.

42:22.159 --> 42:25.159
Thank goodness we got you out
of there in the nick of time.

42:25.159 --> 42:28.599
Oh, now, that reminds me.
I must go to the sweet shop in

42:28.599 --> 42:32.199
Kembleford tomorrow
and replace those humbugs.

42:32.199 --> 42:34.000
How is Mrs Wintham?

42:34.000 --> 42:36.159
They're keeping her at Cottage
Hospital for tonight.

42:36.159 --> 42:38.440
Doctors seem confident she'll make
a full recovery.

42:38.440 --> 42:39.719
Well, come along, Sergeant.

42:39.719 --> 42:42.039
Let's leave these good people
to their food.

42:42.039 --> 42:43.079
Right you are, sir.

42:49.920 --> 42:52.440
Harold! What a pleasant surprise.

42:52.440 --> 42:56.199
I was invited to join you for
a spot of hotpot.

42:56.199 --> 42:57.480
Don't look at me.

42:59.119 --> 43:02.719
Well, I thought it'd be a nice way
of saying thank you.

43:04.480 --> 43:06.360
He did, after all, save the day.

43:06.360 --> 43:08.119
For you, Mrs McCarthy.

43:08.119 --> 43:10.719
Don't worry, I didn't pinch them
from the churchyard.

43:10.719 --> 43:13.639
They're from the meadow
behind my barn.

43:13.639 --> 43:18.199
They are delightful, Mr Slow.
Now, please, make yourself at home.

43:20.960 --> 43:22.719
Wonders never cease.

43:23.880 --> 43:26.599
I thought it was the Christian thing
to do.

43:26.599 --> 43:30.920
Quite right. Now, tell me,
will it be a summer wedding?

43:30.920 --> 43:32.639
SHE EXHALES

43:42.679 --> 43:45.159
Bless us, O Lord,
and these Thy gifts

43:45.159 --> 43:48.800
which of Thy bounty we are about
to receive through Christ our Lord.

43:48.800 --> 43:50.119
Amen. Amen.

43:53.360 --> 43:54.400
Hah!
