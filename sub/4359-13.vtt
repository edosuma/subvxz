01:02.480 --> 01:04.400
English tests
or math quizzes.

01:04.400 --> 01:05.680
I hate woodshop.

01:05.680 --> 01:06.640
Woodshop?

01:06.640 --> 01:08.400
Yeah, all that
noise and dust.

01:08.400 --> 01:10.800
Like the world needs
another spice rack.

01:10.800 --> 01:12.640
You're not good at it,
are you?

01:12.640 --> 01:13.600
The worst.

01:13.600 --> 01:14.440
Hey, Alex...

Ray.

Hey, what's up, man?

01:16.840 --> 01:17.800
Hi, Scott.

01:17.800 --> 01:19.840
So... woodshop, huh?

01:19.840 --> 01:20.960
Yeah, love it.

01:20.960 --> 01:23.000
It's better than gym...
Or lunch.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.720
Oh, I know, I love it, too.

01:24.720 --> 01:27.320
I'm just sorry I
didn't get it this term.

01:27.320 --> 01:28.280
Scott!

01:28.280 --> 01:30.040
Look what I made.

01:30.040 --> 01:33.600
Uh, maybe your little friends
would like to see it, too.

01:36.440 --> 01:37.720
Oh, no!

01:37.720 --> 01:38.960
You know, next week

01:38.960 --> 01:41.440
I'm heading up
the school woodshop club.

01:41.440 --> 01:43.920
Doing the best I can
to qualify as a nerd.

01:43.920 --> 01:44.960
<i>( Boys laugh, slap five )</i>

01:44.960 --> 01:46.480
Really? Maybe I'll join.

01:46.480 --> 01:47.600
Scott...

01:47.600 --> 01:48.920
I need you.

01:48.920 --> 01:51.480
Hey, I'll see
you guys later.

01:53.560 --> 01:54.640
What?

01:54.640 --> 01:55.760
I have a week.

01:55.760 --> 01:58.000
Maybe I'll start
liking it by then.

02:01.520 --> 02:04.000
<i>Annie: Now make the
blue one go higher?</i>

02:06.640 --> 02:08.560
You're not concentrating.

02:10.320 --> 02:12.000
No, I'm not.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.880
I need to ask you something.

02:14.840 --> 02:16.240
I just wanted to know...

02:16.240 --> 02:18.360
How you get a boyfriend.

02:18.360 --> 02:22.280
Well, I guess we entered
a new phase in our relationship.

02:22.280 --> 02:23.480
It's no big deal.

02:23.480 --> 02:25.280
I'm just curious.

02:25.280 --> 02:27.600
Alex, Bryce will be here
any minute.

02:27.600 --> 02:29.520
Let's finish the test first.

02:48.240 --> 02:50.560
<i>( Exhales deeply )</i>

02:50.560 --> 02:52.120
Not bad.

02:53.080 --> 02:54.080
Okay.

02:54.080 --> 02:55.200
Now tell me.

02:55.200 --> 02:57.040
How do you get a boyfriend?

02:57.040 --> 02:58.320
What's the secret?

02:58.320 --> 02:59.480
There's no secret.

02:59.480 --> 03:00.720
It just... happens.

03:00.720 --> 03:02.240
You're in
the right place

03:02.240 --> 03:03.760
at the right time,
and...

03:03.760 --> 03:05.640
He's there and
you're there...

03:05.640 --> 03:08.440
Well, what if you know
where he's going to be?

03:08.440 --> 03:11.760
Can you be there on purpose
to make it the right time?

03:11.760 --> 03:12.760
Even if it means

03:12.760 --> 03:14.360
joining
the woodshop club?

03:14.360 --> 03:15.480
Woodshop?

03:15.480 --> 03:17.040
You hate woodshop.

03:17.040 --> 03:18.240
<i>( Doorbell rings )</i>

03:18.240 --> 03:20.960
Alex, you're too young
to be this desperate.

03:20.960 --> 03:21.920
I know, but...

03:21.920 --> 03:23.720
You should never
do something

03:23.720 --> 03:26.000
to impress some boy,
not even Scott.

03:26.000 --> 03:26.960
Never?

03:26.960 --> 03:29.040
Absolutely not.

03:29.040 --> 03:31.200
Mrs. Mack:
Annie! Bryce is here.

03:32.640 --> 03:34.000
That's...

03:34.000 --> 03:35.840
compromising
your principles.

03:36.800 --> 03:38.320
What principles?

03:38.320 --> 03:40.080
I have principles?

03:40.080 --> 03:41.760
<i>( Door closes )</i>

03:43.840 --> 03:45.760
Paradise Valley
National Park?

03:45.760 --> 03:47.480
<i> Great mountain climbing.</i>

03:47.480 --> 03:48.680
Clean, crisp air

03:48.680 --> 03:49.840
amazing views

03:49.840 --> 03:52.520
and, like, 20 different
kinds of Poison Ivy.

03:52.520 --> 03:55.080
<i>I don't think
there are 20 kinds.</i>

03:55.080 --> 03:58.760
You don't really like
mountain climbing, do you?

03:58.760 --> 04:00.600
<i>I've never been, but...</i>

04:00.600 --> 04:03.240
Climbing rocks
and scaling cliffs

04:03.240 --> 04:04.840
sounds dangerous...

04:04.840 --> 04:05.960
and itchy.

04:05.960 --> 04:07.720
Oh, I'm sorry
to hear that.

04:07.720 --> 04:10.480
I've been wanting to
check out this new trail

04:10.480 --> 04:13.240
and I was kind of hoping
you'd like to come.

04:13.240 --> 04:15.720
It's really pretty safe,
they got, uh...

04:15.720 --> 04:16.680
Park rangers...

04:16.680 --> 04:17.920
Safety equipment...

04:17.920 --> 04:19.200
Calamine lotion.

04:19.200 --> 04:22.120
Gee, that sounds like
it involves going outside.

04:22.120 --> 04:25.320
Venturing into a land
without beakers and test tubes.

04:25.320 --> 04:27.360
It's really not her speed,
Bryce.

04:27.360 --> 04:28.640
You think you know me.

04:28.640 --> 04:31.280
You could never do anything
that strenuous.

04:31.280 --> 04:32.840
I'll bet Annie

04:32.840 --> 04:35.800
could do anything
she sets her mind to.

04:35.800 --> 04:37.280
Anything she wants.

04:37.280 --> 04:38.320
Thank you.

04:38.320 --> 04:40.160
And I want to go
mountain climbing.

04:40.160 --> 04:41.600
Great!
Great.

04:41.600 --> 04:42.600
Saturday?

04:50.240 --> 04:52.320
Paradise Valley
air freshener, huh?

04:52.320 --> 04:54.720
And Danielle Atron
wants you to handle

04:54.720 --> 04:56.280
this account personally?

04:56.280 --> 04:58.920
I vowed I would never work
with her again.

04:58.920 --> 05:00.320
She's so difficult.

05:00.320 --> 05:01.440
She's so picky.

05:01.440 --> 05:02.560
She's so...

05:02.560 --> 05:03.680
...here!

05:03.680 --> 05:05.600
<i>( Footsteps )</i>

05:05.600 --> 05:07.080
Danielle!

05:07.080 --> 05:08.880
We were just talking
about you.

05:08.880 --> 05:12.480
I see you're handling our new
air freshener account, Barbara.

05:12.480 --> 05:14.360
Well, I'm holding
the folder.

05:14.360 --> 05:15.640
<i>( Laughs nervously )</i>

05:15.640 --> 05:17.040
Yes, I'm handling it.

05:17.040 --> 05:18.560
Um, Danielle, I, I hope

05:18.560 --> 05:21.160
that this goes smoother
than last time.

05:21.160 --> 05:23.160
Not to worry--
I've already chosen

05:23.160 --> 05:24.680
<i>the perfect spokesperson.</i>

05:24.680 --> 05:27.200
She'll appear in all
television commercials

05:27.200 --> 05:28.280
and magazine ads.

05:28.280 --> 05:29.960
Miss Atron
has found someone

05:29.960 --> 05:31.560
all of America will love.

05:31.560 --> 05:33.360
She's warm,
she's friendly...

05:33.360 --> 05:35.480
she's beautiful,
she's charming...

05:35.480 --> 05:36.440
Wonderful.

05:36.440 --> 05:37.560
Who is she?

05:37.560 --> 05:38.280
Me!

05:52.760 --> 05:53.800
Hmm.

05:53.800 --> 05:54.920
Smells terrific.

05:54.920 --> 05:57.320
I wish you were doing
the commercial.

05:57.320 --> 05:58.280
Mom, Dad.

05:58.280 --> 05:59.640
Bryce asked if I could go

05:59.640 --> 06:01.800
mountain climbing
with him this weekend.

06:01.800 --> 06:02.760
It's okay, right?

06:02.760 --> 06:04.120
Whoa, not so fast, Annie!

06:04.120 --> 06:05.360
Mountain climbing?

06:05.360 --> 06:06.320
Yeah. Like a hill

06:06.320 --> 06:07.280
only bigger.

06:07.280 --> 06:08.880
This really
interests you?

06:08.880 --> 06:10.400
I like to try
new things.

06:10.400 --> 06:12.400
Sounds a little
dangerous to me.

06:12.400 --> 06:13.720
Bryce wouldn't ask me

06:13.720 --> 06:16.120
if there was anything
unsafe about it.

06:16.120 --> 06:17.080
I don't know.

06:17.080 --> 06:18.840
Hey, since when do you worry

06:18.840 --> 06:20.320
about my safety, anyway?

06:20.320 --> 06:21.800
You never said anything

06:21.800 --> 06:24.720
when I handled nuclear waste
or deadly viruses.

06:24.720 --> 06:26.120
You handled what?

06:26.120 --> 06:28.360
How dangerous can
a little climbing be?

06:28.360 --> 06:30.600
<i>You handled what?</i>

06:30.600 --> 06:31.640
Oh, Mom.

06:31.640 --> 06:33.920
Your father and I
will discuss this.

06:33.920 --> 06:36.480
You let our daughter handle
nuclear waste

06:36.480 --> 06:37.840
and deadly viruses?

06:37.840 --> 06:39.120
At the office, under

06:39.120 --> 06:42.840
controlled circumstances
with... special equipment.

06:42.840 --> 06:45.440
I-I wish we had discussed
this first, George.

06:45.440 --> 06:46.840
It was for science.

06:46.840 --> 06:47.920
For humanity.

06:49.400 --> 06:50.840
It'll never happen again

06:50.840 --> 06:52.920
and mountain climbing
is definitely

06:52.920 --> 06:54.800
out of the question, right?

06:55.760 --> 06:56.640
Actually, I...

06:56.640 --> 06:59.280
I think it may be good for her.

06:59.280 --> 07:00.840
I trust Bryce, and

07:00.840 --> 07:04.240
you know, if Annie doesn't
start getting outdoors...

07:04.240 --> 07:07.560
this might be the only
pine scent she ever smells.

07:09.480 --> 07:10.680
<i>( Coughs )</i>

07:10.680 --> 07:12.280
<i>( Shouting ):
Annie?</i>

07:12.280 --> 07:14.280
We've decided.

07:18.440 --> 07:20.480
I talked it over
with Mom and Dad

07:20.480 --> 07:22.480
and I'm going
mountain climbing

07:22.480 --> 07:23.960
with Bryce
this weekend.

07:23.960 --> 07:27.360
Boy, the lengths you'll go
just to impress that guy.

07:27.360 --> 07:29.000
Excuse me?

07:29.000 --> 07:30.480
Well, isn't
this exactly

07:30.480 --> 07:32.240
<i>what you told me
not to do?</i>

07:32.240 --> 07:35.640
That you shouldn't do something
just to impress a guy?

07:35.640 --> 07:36.920
I mean...

07:36.920 --> 07:39.240
Aren't you going
mountain climbing

07:39.240 --> 07:40.760
just to impress Bryce?

07:40.760 --> 07:42.520
I don't need to impress him.

07:42.520 --> 07:45.600
I'm doing it because I think
that it's important

07:45.600 --> 07:47.600
to try to share his interests.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.200
Same as he does for me.

07:49.200 --> 07:50.960
Same as he does for you?

07:50.960 --> 07:51.920
Mm-hmm.

07:51.920 --> 07:52.880
I don't see him

07:52.880 --> 07:54.640
drooling over
computer projects

07:54.640 --> 07:56.960
or helping you set up
DNA molecules.

07:56.960 --> 07:59.720
You're doing this to make
him like you better.

07:59.720 --> 08:02.480
You're doing something
you don't even want to.

08:02.480 --> 08:05.240
You're... you're
compromising your principles!

08:05.240 --> 08:06.400
Oh, you don't know

08:06.400 --> 08:08.040
what you're talking about.

08:08.040 --> 08:09.840
Maybe...
But it sounded good.

08:09.840 --> 08:11.480
<i>( Door closes )</i>

08:31.800 --> 08:33.080
<i> Woodworking and you?</i>

08:33.080 --> 08:35.039
Your life's just too exciting.

08:35.039 --> 08:37.000
Did you know
that there's, like

08:37.000 --> 08:39.200
a thousand different
types of nails?

08:39.200 --> 08:41.919
Why can't people just
glue things together?

08:41.919 --> 08:43.520
Bryce:
Hey, what's up, Ray?

08:43.520 --> 08:44.480
What's up, man?

08:44.480 --> 08:45.440
Morning, Bryce.

08:45.440 --> 08:46.400
Morning, sir.

08:46.400 --> 08:48.520
Something I need
to ask you...

08:48.520 --> 08:51.160
Mr. Mack, I assure you
we'll be supervised

08:51.160 --> 08:52.520
by an experienced ranger

08:52.520 --> 08:54.080
and using
special equipment.

08:54.080 --> 08:57.000
You have no reason to worry
about Annie's safety.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.960
Was that what you
wanted to ask?

08:58.960 --> 09:00.320
Uh, that, and... are you

09:00.320 --> 09:02.320
sure you have enough gas
in your car?

09:02.320 --> 09:03.840
Full tank.

09:03.840 --> 09:05.000
Have a nice time.

09:05.000 --> 09:05.960
Okay.

09:05.960 --> 09:07.000
Hey.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.440
Look! Gourmet sandwiches
for four.

09:09.440 --> 09:11.040
Where are Mark and Alyssa?

09:11.040 --> 09:12.800
When I went
to pick them up

09:12.800 --> 09:14.880
they saw the brochure
with the picture

09:14.880 --> 09:16.200
of the mountain on it

09:16.200 --> 09:18.000
and they're at
the movies now.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.520
Some outdoor
spirit, huh?

09:19.520 --> 09:21.040
We're not busy
for lunch.

09:21.040 --> 09:23.440
You have to climb a mountain
to get one.

09:23.440 --> 09:25.680
Well, hey, you two
want to come along?

09:25.680 --> 09:26.640
Yeah!
Bryce!

09:26.640 --> 09:28.360
Ray, are you sure
about this?

09:28.360 --> 09:30.440
Yeah. Come on, Alex,
it'll be cool!

09:30.440 --> 09:31.760
Hmm, well, all right.

09:31.760 --> 09:32.840
Alex...

09:34.040 --> 09:35.240
You don't want to go.

09:35.240 --> 09:36.800
Yes, I do.

09:36.800 --> 09:38.320
Bryce:
Well, hey, Mr. Mack

09:38.320 --> 09:39.440
is it okay?

09:39.440 --> 09:41.000
Well, I'll check
with Barbara.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.520
Great, I'll go
call my dad.

09:46.280 --> 09:47.680
<i>( Zips bag sharply )</i>

09:47.680 --> 09:49.600
It'll be cool,
Annie.

09:49.600 --> 09:50.920
Trust me.

09:55.720 --> 09:58.720
<i>( Birds screeching )</i>

10:08.120 --> 10:10.320
Wait till we're up
on the north face.

10:10.320 --> 10:13.920
It's a perfect 360-degree view
of all of Paradise Valley.

10:13.920 --> 10:16.640
Even the sewage plant,
if that's your thing.

10:16.640 --> 10:17.680
Oh, joy.

10:21.320 --> 10:22.560
So, Bryce, you ever

10:22.560 --> 10:24.520
do any science stuff
with Annie?

10:24.520 --> 10:26.880
Yeah, once I found
a mysterious object

10:26.880 --> 10:28.400
in a sneaker
under my bed

10:28.400 --> 10:30.360
and I gave it
to her to analyze.

10:30.360 --> 10:31.840
Figure out what it was.

10:31.840 --> 10:33.160
A dust-covered peach.

10:33.160 --> 10:34.080
Ew. That's it?

10:34.080 --> 10:35.200
Well, yeah, I mean

10:35.200 --> 10:37.440
Annie's the molecule
lover, not me.

10:40.800 --> 10:42.760
You're not even
supposed to be here.

10:42.760 --> 10:45.040
At least try to mind
your own business?

10:45.040 --> 10:46.920
I'm just looking out for you.

10:46.920 --> 10:48.040
You're my sister.

10:48.040 --> 10:49.280
It's my business.

10:50.240 --> 10:51.120
Alex.

10:51.120 --> 10:52.080
Annie.

10:52.080 --> 10:53.360
<i>( Chuckles )</i>

10:53.360 --> 10:55.120
Check out the mountain.

10:55.120 --> 10:57.400
It's just a puny little hill.

10:57.400 --> 10:58.360
<i>( Chuckles )</i>

10:58.360 --> 10:59.320
Yeah, it is.

10:59.320 --> 11:01.560
But we're climbing that one.

11:08.640 --> 11:12.480
<i>( Wind whistling )</i>

11:20.040 --> 11:21.280
So, I see you've got

11:21.280 --> 11:23.480
all the requisite
safety equipment:

11:23.480 --> 11:26.760
Helmets, harnesses...
These things.

11:26.760 --> 11:27.960
Carabiners.

11:27.960 --> 11:29.720
Right, carabiners.

11:29.720 --> 11:31.640
You know what
these things are.

11:31.640 --> 11:33.280
You're just
putting me on.

11:33.280 --> 11:35.320
Not really, but
don't tell my boss.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.800
Do you need all
this trail mix?

11:38.800 --> 11:39.960
Yeah, for stamina.

11:39.960 --> 11:42.480
And to leave a trail
in case we get lost.

11:42.480 --> 11:45.680
Good. You wouldn't want me
to have to save you.

11:48.120 --> 11:50.200
No, we sure wouldn't.

11:55.160 --> 11:57.760
Hope it's not going
to take a lot of stamina

11:57.760 --> 11:59.320
to hike the hiking trail.

11:59.320 --> 12:00.560
Raymond!

12:00.560 --> 12:03.160
What? You want
to climb that thing?

12:09.600 --> 12:10.720
Hiking trail, huh?

12:17.480 --> 12:19.160
We could do
the hiking trail

12:19.160 --> 12:21.320
if you're having
second thoughts.

12:21.320 --> 12:22.600
No. Uh-uh.

12:22.600 --> 12:26.280
It's time
I learned the ropes.

12:26.280 --> 12:28.160
See you guys
at the top.

12:35.640 --> 12:37.200
Ranger:
Ah, young love.

12:37.200 --> 12:39.640
Kind of, um...

12:39.640 --> 12:40.720
Sickening?

12:40.720 --> 12:41.920
Yeah.

12:41.920 --> 12:43.240
Hope Annie'll
be okay.

12:43.240 --> 12:44.800
They bring any bug spray?

12:44.800 --> 12:45.800
Yeah.

12:45.800 --> 12:47.680
Then they'll
be fine.

12:47.680 --> 12:49.360
<i>( Insect buzzing )</i>

13:07.000 --> 13:08.400
This is the first time

13:08.400 --> 13:10.560
we've had tea
together, isn't it?

13:10.560 --> 13:12.080
That I recall.

13:13.440 --> 13:16.680
Chamomile--
it's my favorite.

13:16.680 --> 13:18.080
I'm so pleased.

13:20.200 --> 13:22.640
I love what you've done
with the office.

13:22.640 --> 13:23.960
I was still
thinking

13:23.960 --> 13:25.720
it could be
a little less...

13:25.720 --> 13:27.640
Cold? Antiseptic?

13:27.640 --> 13:28.680
Formal.

13:28.680 --> 13:29.800
I was thinking

13:29.800 --> 13:31.440
of lightening it
up a bit.

13:31.440 --> 13:34.160
Oh... well,
that would be easy.

13:34.160 --> 13:36.560
We could bring in some
more flowers, and...

13:36.560 --> 13:38.120
And put up
some new drapes

13:38.120 --> 13:40.120
redo everything
in chintz

13:40.120 --> 13:41.240
a new carpet and...

13:41.240 --> 13:42.920
And get rid
of the couch

13:42.920 --> 13:45.000
and lose this
high-tech desk.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.240
It's so eighties.

13:46.240 --> 13:47.680
What do you think?

13:47.680 --> 13:51.600
Listen, Barbara, I didn't hire
you to be my girlfriend.

13:51.600 --> 13:52.640
Thank goodness.

13:52.640 --> 13:53.760
I hired you because

13:53.760 --> 13:55.040
I need you to come up

13:55.040 --> 13:57.040
with an excellent
ad campaign.

13:57.040 --> 13:59.800
So give it to me straight.

13:59.800 --> 14:03.720
What do I need to do to...
make America love me?

14:05.040 --> 14:06.320
A makeover?

14:08.080 --> 14:10.120
A big makeover.

14:10.120 --> 14:12.560
A total makeover.

14:14.320 --> 14:15.920
Fine.

14:17.440 --> 14:19.120
Let's get started.

14:20.240 --> 14:22.440
Man, your sister's
even worse than you.

14:22.440 --> 14:25.000
Climbing that thing
just to impress Bryce?

14:25.000 --> 14:27.240
She wants to share
his experiences.

14:27.240 --> 14:28.840
The way you want
to share

14:28.840 --> 14:30.640
Scott's woodshop
experience?

14:30.640 --> 14:31.720
Exactly.

14:31.720 --> 14:33.480
Annie and Bryce
are a couple.

14:33.480 --> 14:35.840
They're supposed
to do things together.

14:35.840 --> 14:38.800
But they're supposed to
do things they both like.

14:38.800 --> 14:40.800
You sister shouldn't
be up there.

14:40.800 --> 14:42.560
So I shouldn't
join woodshop?

14:42.560 --> 14:44.920
Oh, no, you should
definitely do it.

14:44.920 --> 14:48.520
Use your powers to float
giant beams across the room.

14:48.520 --> 14:51.560
Hammer them together
without using your hands.

14:51.560 --> 14:53.160
You'd be the best.

14:53.160 --> 14:55.720
Probably still hate it.

14:57.240 --> 14:58.760
All right,
come on, Annie.

14:58.760 --> 15:00.200
You've almost
made it.

15:00.200 --> 15:01.920
This one's
a piece of cake.

15:01.920 --> 15:03.680
A piece of
real stale cake.

15:03.680 --> 15:05.760
I'll spot you.
You ready?

15:05.760 --> 15:06.840
I guess.

15:06.840 --> 15:08.640
Okay, just
put your foot

15:08.640 --> 15:09.480
over...

15:20.760 --> 15:21.800
in any danger.

I'm hanging from a cliff.

15:24.400 --> 15:26.440
No, no,
you're not.

15:26.440 --> 15:28.080
You're hanging from a rope

15:28.080 --> 15:29.880
and it's not going anywhere.

15:29.880 --> 15:30.760
What now?

15:30.760 --> 15:31.840
I can't reach you.

15:31.840 --> 15:32.880
I'll get help.

16:44.640 --> 16:46.560
That sounds like Annie.

Annie!

16:48.560 --> 16:51.160
Annie, where are you?

Annie!

Come on.

16:59.080 --> 17:01.880
Oh, how did I get into this?

17:01.880 --> 17:03.360
Alex:
We're coming.

17:04.640 --> 17:06.119
Oh, my gosh.

17:07.480 --> 17:08.760
Are you okay?

17:08.760 --> 17:11.359
Alex, does it look like
I'm okay?

17:11.359 --> 17:12.520
Hang in there.

17:12.520 --> 17:15.319
There's not much else I can do.

17:17.920 --> 17:19.800
Alex, your canteen.

17:25.800 --> 17:27.800
Annie: Alex, what
are you doing?

17:44.200 --> 17:45.960
Annie:
What are you doing?

17:48.760 --> 17:50.200
I'm not really thirsty.

17:50.200 --> 17:52.440
It's not water

17:52.440 --> 17:54.080
it's your sister.

17:54.080 --> 17:55.480
Alex?

17:59.680 --> 18:02.360
Alex:
Hang on, Annie, hang on.

18:09.880 --> 18:13.200
Okay, I'm going to try
and swing you to me.

18:18.200 --> 18:20.560
Come on, Annie,
reach!

18:22.040 --> 18:24.120
Come on, Annie.

18:30.360 --> 18:31.800
Come on, Annie.

18:31.800 --> 18:33.000
You're so close.

18:41.480 --> 18:44.720
Don't tell me you were
just admiring the view.

18:44.720 --> 18:47.360
I guess I got in
over my head.

18:47.360 --> 18:48.640
I guess so.

18:48.640 --> 18:53.240
And... now
what do we do?

18:53.240 --> 18:55.760
Try, try again.

18:55.760 --> 18:57.280
Watch me.

18:58.680 --> 19:01.040
All right!

19:05.520 --> 19:07.480
All right, Annie.

19:17.360 --> 19:21.120
I present to you
the new and improved

What do you think?

19:29.680 --> 19:31.080
I think...

19:32.440 --> 19:34.120
You look ridiculous.

19:36.320 --> 19:37.640
Thank you.

19:38.640 --> 19:39.920
But I have an idea.

19:41.200 --> 19:42.720
Bryce:
She's not in danger

19:42.720 --> 19:43.960
just really scared.

19:48.240 --> 19:49.880
Ooh, tuna fish.

19:49.880 --> 19:52.800
Yeah, I'd be afraid, too.

19:52.800 --> 19:54.440
Annie, h-how
did you...?

19:54.440 --> 19:55.920
Alex and Ray
helped me.

19:55.920 --> 19:58.480
Actually, Annie's
quite the climber.

19:58.480 --> 20:00.200
No, no, I'm
really not.

20:00.200 --> 20:02.280
Ranger: Is that a
chicken sandwich?

20:02.280 --> 20:03.480
Ray:
Yes.

20:04.920 --> 20:06.760
I hope you're
not disappointed.

20:06.760 --> 20:09.080
That you didn't plunge
to your death?

20:09.080 --> 20:10.600
No, I'm okay with that.

20:10.600 --> 20:12.640
Maybe next time
you could share

20:12.640 --> 20:14.560
my interest in
bowling, okay?

20:14.560 --> 20:15.840
You like bowling?

20:15.840 --> 20:19.240
No, but we don't have
to do this again.

20:19.240 --> 20:22.280
Yeah, but how are we
going to get down?

20:22.280 --> 20:24.960
Uh... hiking trail.

20:40.960 --> 20:42.800
Hey, you joining us?

20:42.800 --> 20:46.240
No, I just came
to say that I wasn't.

20:46.240 --> 20:48.240
See... well

20:48.240 --> 20:50.080
I don't really like woodshop.

20:51.160 --> 20:52.200
Oh.

20:52.200 --> 20:55.320
Alex, are you
joining woodshop?

20:55.320 --> 20:56.640
No, I just...

20:56.640 --> 20:57.680
Too bad.

20:57.680 --> 21:00.240
The more the merrier.

21:00.240 --> 21:02.960
And it's so much fun
making things.

21:02.960 --> 21:05.160
Well, I'm glad
you enjoy it.

21:05.160 --> 21:06.600
I just couldn't pretend.

21:06.600 --> 21:09.320
See you inside.

21:09.320 --> 21:10.720
Soon.

21:10.720 --> 21:11.960
Scott:
Yeah.

21:11.960 --> 21:13.080
If you hate woodshop

21:13.080 --> 21:15.200
I guess I can't
convince you otherwise.

21:15.200 --> 21:17.320
Definitely not.

21:17.320 --> 21:19.360
I'm sure we have other things
in common.

21:19.360 --> 21:21.280
Probably.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.320
Scott, I need you.

21:23.320 --> 21:25.560
I'd better go.

21:45.800 --> 21:47.160
No, I gave that up.

21:47.160 --> 21:49.840
What, did Scott
drop out of woodshop?

21:49.840 --> 21:51.360
No, but you know how

you were trying too hard
to impress Bryce?

Me?
