01:49.242 --> 01:51.244
S'those blackouts
we've been havin', Lunella.

01:51.244 --> 01:53.580
Lost batches
means lost business.

01:53.580 --> 01:55.415
So they put
the kibosh on the knish.

01:55.415 --> 01:58.352
Oh, but those knish
were knish-a-licious!

01:58.352 --> 02:00.821
So is this sammie, b-t-dubs.

02:00.821 --> 02:03.256
Hey, at least
your family's spot is hoppin'.

02:11.898 --> 02:13.734
Mixer's good
to go, Mom!

02:15.435 --> 02:17.904
- First sticks meaning--
- Thank you, sweet child.

02:17.904 --> 02:20.140
We're back, y'all!

02:20.140 --> 02:22.809
And these wings are as spicy
as the lady who made 'em.

02:24.211 --> 02:25.579
Hey, check it out, Lu...

02:25.579 --> 02:27.014
Blind Date Skate Night.

02:27.014 --> 02:29.449
Singles skating,
but blindfolded.

02:29.449 --> 02:31.351
Sounds like
a winner to me, dad.

02:31.351 --> 02:33.320
Lunella Lafayette:

02:33.320 --> 02:36.523
you better get yourself out here
with your old Pops.

02:36.523 --> 02:39.826
And say "no" to the longest
reigning Roller Jam King?

02:39.826 --> 02:41.161
Do I look like a fool?

02:46.033 --> 02:48.201
Don't sweat those blackouts,
Lower East Side!

02:48.201 --> 02:51.638
They can take our power,
but they can't take our spirit!

02:56.376 --> 02:59.479
Not again!
Another blackout?

03:02.749 --> 03:04.084
Sorry, folks.

03:04.084 --> 03:05.719
Here's your money back.

03:05.719 --> 03:07.287
Please roll with us again.

03:07.287 --> 03:10.857
Oh, man, somebody
has got to fix this.

03:20.434 --> 03:22.436
How many blackouts
is that this month?

03:22.436 --> 03:25.038
Too many, baby.
That's how many.

03:25.038 --> 03:27.007
Are we gonna lose
the business, Pops?

03:27.007 --> 03:29.910
- Like the knish shop?
- Hey, hey, hey.

03:29.910 --> 03:31.344
We'll get through it.
What do we do

03:31.344 --> 03:32.712
when the going gets tough?

03:32.712 --> 03:34.347
We roll with it.

03:34.347 --> 03:35.816
That's what I'm talking about.

03:35.816 --> 03:37.751
What do we do, Lu?

03:37.751 --> 03:39.986
We roll with it.

03:41.288 --> 03:42.689
Oh, that's right.

03:42.689 --> 03:43.857
I am so motivation.

03:50.597 --> 03:54.734
So?

04:00.507 --> 04:01.875
Do the thing!

04:01.875 --> 04:03.643
Come on, Do the thing!

04:03.643 --> 04:05.412
Hello, Eduardo. Again?

04:07.814 --> 04:10.617
What's that?
I mean, I totally get it

04:10.617 --> 04:13.353
because I'm awesome at Math,
but what is it?

04:13.353 --> 04:15.756
Oh, so glad you asked, Anand.

04:15.756 --> 04:19.025
I think it's some
kinda crazy power generator.

04:19.025 --> 04:20.961
You see,
there was this scientist,

04:20.961 --> 04:22.963
she was working on this
top-secret project

04:22.963 --> 04:24.764
for the space program,
but then she just up

04:24.764 --> 04:26.800
and vanished
and all that's left of her work

04:26.800 --> 04:28.401
are these incomplete blueprints
I found on the internet--

04:28.401 --> 04:29.903
Beep! Beep!
Beep! Nerd alert!

04:29.903 --> 04:32.205
Level five, nerd alert.

04:32.205 --> 04:34.307
Anyways, if I can crack this,

04:34.307 --> 04:36.743
the Lower East Side
would have its own power grid.

04:38.678 --> 04:39.880
Huh? Coach Hrbek?

04:39.880 --> 04:41.915
Hey, look,
I'm just subbing

04:41.915 --> 04:43.884
in science 'til they find
a permanent hire.

04:43.884 --> 04:45.786
So, is it done yet or what?

04:47.320 --> 04:50.123
- I can do that.
- Sick!

04:50.123 --> 04:53.460
Ha! She's filming again.

04:53.460 --> 04:55.128
Hey guys,

04:55.128 --> 04:57.430
Casey María Eva Duarte
Goldberg Calderon here.

04:57.430 --> 05:00.700
I have to ask: What's the deal
with Chicken Fried Steak anyway?

05:00.700 --> 05:02.736
Is it chicken or is it steak?

05:02.736 --> 05:05.438
Comment below and be sure
to hit that like button, people.

05:07.407 --> 05:09.876
Eduardo,
I know that was you!

05:09.876 --> 05:12.979
Oh, I got you.

05:28.862 --> 05:31.298
Oh, no.

05:31.298 --> 05:33.767
- Everyone okay?
- S'alright sweetheart.

05:33.767 --> 05:36.136
- What happened?
- Someone tried to rob the place

05:36.136 --> 05:38.238
during the blackout,
but thanks to you,

05:38.238 --> 05:40.240
- they didn't taken a thing.
- Uh-uh.

05:40.240 --> 05:42.175
Your battery-powered
security system

05:42.175 --> 05:45.245
with that sweet surprise inside
worked like a charm.

05:45.245 --> 05:47.180
He's going to be fine.

05:47.180 --> 05:50.016
Ahmed wasn't so lucky, though.
Cleaned out his deli.

05:50.016 --> 05:51.618
Oh, they even took
the cold cuts.

05:51.618 --> 05:53.887
Meanwhile, blackouts
mean more crime,

05:53.887 --> 05:55.789
not to mention lost business,

05:55.789 --> 05:58.925
which means we get pushed
out of the community we love!

05:58.925 --> 06:00.894
I am not raising
my baby in Jersey!

06:00.894 --> 06:02.796
No disrespect to Jersey.

06:02.796 --> 06:05.498
Well then, somebody
call the Avengers or something!

06:05.498 --> 06:07.801
- I bet they could solve it.
- Aw, sweetheart,

06:07.801 --> 06:10.370
I'm afraid the Avengers
got bigger fish to fry.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.906
Besides, do they even go
below fourteenth street?

06:12.906 --> 06:15.108
We just gotta roll
with it, baby.

06:21.848 --> 06:24.751
- Hungry, baby?
- Hmm? Not really.

06:24.751 --> 06:25.952
Still working on that thing

06:25.952 --> 06:27.754
that's gonna fix
all our problems?

06:27.754 --> 06:29.256
Well, it's like you always say,

06:29.256 --> 06:30.924
one girl can make
a difference, right?

06:30.924 --> 06:33.460
Especially
when that girl is you.

06:33.460 --> 06:35.562
I may not be
able to help you with...

06:35.562 --> 06:38.565
Whatever all this is.
But I can help you

06:38.565 --> 06:40.133
with some inspiration.

06:42.302 --> 06:44.004
Uh, cool.

06:44.004 --> 06:45.272
- Thanks, mom--
- Well, hold up.

06:45.272 --> 06:47.140
Does that say "radioactive?"

06:47.140 --> 06:48.208
You're not actually
building that thing, right?

06:48.208 --> 06:49.709
No, of course not.

06:49.709 --> 06:50.844
Purely theoretical.

06:50.844 --> 06:51.912
Okay. Good.

06:51.912 --> 06:53.013
No radioactive stuff

06:53.013 --> 06:54.748
in the apartment.

06:54.748 --> 06:57.550
Well, technically,
it's not in the apartment.

07:10.297 --> 07:12.866
What up, Moon Girl?
Impressed, right?

07:12.866 --> 07:14.234
Oh, you know,
you're impressed!

07:14.234 --> 07:16.136
But should I try it, though?

07:16.136 --> 07:18.772
<i>Well,
how the books looking?</i>

07:18.772 --> 07:20.407
<i>It's bad, A.</i>

07:20.407 --> 07:22.909
<i>If things
don't turn around quick.</i>

07:22.909 --> 07:25.312
<i>We may need
to sell the rink.</i>

07:26.813 --> 07:29.082
Oh, I've got to fix this.

07:29.082 --> 07:31.418
I may not totally know
what this thing does,

07:31.418 --> 07:33.353
but ready or not,
I have to try.

07:34.854 --> 07:37.757
It's working?

07:37.757 --> 07:39.359
Yes! Yes!

07:39.359 --> 07:41.594
Oh, no, no! Too much juice.

07:44.898 --> 07:47.734
It's a portal generator!

08:02.782 --> 08:04.150
Cool!

08:07.487 --> 08:08.655
Ey!

08:09.956 --> 08:11.658
Wait, wait, wait.
No, not cool,

08:11.658 --> 08:13.793
not cool, not cool.

08:21.868 --> 08:24.804
Hey guys, Casey here,

08:24.804 --> 08:28.174
talking to the people about
their fave blackout attire.

08:28.174 --> 08:30.477
Whoa!

08:30.477 --> 08:33.246
Please
don't destroy New York City!

08:41.388 --> 08:43.423
Hmm?

08:49.896 --> 08:51.498
No! Stop!

08:52.899 --> 08:55.802
Well, that was easy.

09:00.006 --> 09:02.375
Hot dogs!
You like hot dogs?

09:14.320 --> 09:18.825
Oh. Look, I am not your mama.

09:20.894 --> 09:22.929
No matter how cute you are.

09:32.906 --> 09:35.074
What is that?

09:35.074 --> 09:36.810
That is why we've been
having blackouts.

09:36.810 --> 09:39.012
She's literally
stealing our power!

09:41.881 --> 09:43.550
Look out! Help her!

09:48.588 --> 09:51.357
C'mon!

09:57.130 --> 09:59.199
See? Right there, baby.
Right there.

09:59.199 --> 10:01.768
What have I been telling you
for the last 40 years?

10:01.768 --> 10:03.603
That there
are lizards in the sewers

10:03.603 --> 10:06.106
and it's only a matter of time
before they rise up.

10:06.106 --> 10:08.908
Please, we all know
this is about "The Man"

10:08.908 --> 10:10.877
paying no mind
to this community.

10:10.877 --> 10:12.112
Nuh-uh! You're both wrong!

10:13.346 --> 10:15.949
Actually, I heard
it's some, uh...

10:15.949 --> 10:18.418
electrical lady.
Sucking our power.

10:18.418 --> 10:20.386
Like an electrical vampire.

10:23.189 --> 10:25.258
Now the lizard
uprising sounds legit.

10:25.258 --> 10:27.894
- Oh, that is hilarious.
- Hold up.

10:27.894 --> 10:29.229
What are you doin'?

10:30.964 --> 10:34.234
You can't eat that
without some-a my pie!

10:34.234 --> 10:35.635
Here ya go sweetheart.

10:38.638 --> 10:42.175
Wow! I guess they didn't
have pie back wherever...

10:42.175 --> 10:45.044
Or whenever you came from, huh?

10:45.044 --> 10:47.413
Ehhh?

10:47.413 --> 10:49.883
Pretty dope setup, right?
It's an old subway station.

10:49.883 --> 10:51.951
I just added a fusion generator,

10:51.951 --> 10:54.787
electromagnetic shielding,
triple redundant internet.

10:54.787 --> 10:56.789
Y'now, the basics.

10:56.789 --> 10:59.492
Oop, oop, oop.
No! Not food.

10:59.492 --> 11:01.628
That's what brought you here.

11:01.628 --> 11:04.797
See, it was designed
by this super-cool scientist,

11:04.797 --> 11:06.833
Moon Girl.
She's my hero.

11:06.833 --> 11:08.234
Nobody knows her real name.

11:08.234 --> 11:09.903
I was trying
to replicate her work,

11:09.903 --> 11:11.871
and I thought
it was a power source,

11:11.871 --> 11:13.873
but turns out it rips holes

11:13.873 --> 11:15.942
in the space-time
continuum and...

11:15.942 --> 11:18.912
Well, you were here
for the rest.

11:18.912 --> 11:21.514
Your trip here
used up half my juice.

11:21.514 --> 11:23.883
It took forever
to synthesize that fuel.

11:23.883 --> 11:26.019
There's barely
enough to get you home.

11:28.588 --> 11:30.757
Does that mean
you don't wanna go home?

11:32.258 --> 11:34.894
But what have
I even do with you?

11:34.894 --> 11:36.796
I can't have you
stomping around,

11:36.796 --> 11:38.898
scaring people like last night.

11:38.898 --> 11:42.068
Well, you did save somebody too.

11:42.068 --> 11:44.170
Oh, that was crazy, right?

11:44.170 --> 11:46.272
As if the Lower East Side
doesn't have enough

11:46.272 --> 11:48.575
to deal with,
now we got a supervillain?

11:48.575 --> 11:52.045
What we really need
are some su--

11:56.549 --> 11:58.851
Superheroes!

11:58.851 --> 12:00.887
Us! Me and you!

12:00.887 --> 12:02.855
It's perfect!

12:02.855 --> 12:04.390
My brains, your brawn.

12:04.390 --> 12:06.893
We can really help people!

12:06.893 --> 12:08.995
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:08.995 --> 12:10.663
What am I saying,

12:10.663 --> 12:12.832
who's gonna take
13-year-old-superhero,

12:12.832 --> 12:14.968
seriously?

12:14.968 --> 12:18.871
Although I am
the smartest 13-year-old I know.

12:18.871 --> 12:21.808
And now I have a dinosaur!

12:21.808 --> 12:23.943
But I don't
have any superpowers.

12:23.943 --> 12:27.580
Wait! My brain is my superpower!

12:27.580 --> 12:29.749
I could build gadgets,
trick out my skates,

12:29.749 --> 12:33.319
all sorts of stuff!
I mean, who else is gonna do it?

12:33.319 --> 12:36.723
The fate of our community
is on the line here, right?

12:36.723 --> 12:39.192
So what do you think, big guy?

12:39.192 --> 12:41.561
You wanna be superheroes
with me?

12:41.561 --> 12:43.663
Wo-hoo! But listen,

12:43.663 --> 12:46.399
we gotta do this on the D-L
or my family will freak.

12:46.399 --> 12:48.301
Nobody can know.

12:48.301 --> 12:50.203
<i>Adria and James,
I presume?</i>

12:50.203 --> 12:52.272
<i>It's a pleasure
to finally meet you.</i>

12:52.272 --> 12:55.341
I'm Casey Calderona,
Lunella's best friend.

12:55.341 --> 12:57.644
- Lunella Lafayette?
- Here's my card.

12:57.644 --> 12:59.879
- How old are you?
- Thirteen. But only for now--

12:59.879 --> 13:01.648
- Carrie!
- Casey.

13:01.648 --> 13:03.316
Casey!

13:03.316 --> 13:05.852
My homie from homeroom!

13:08.888 --> 13:10.857
Love the crib.

13:10.857 --> 13:12.992
Really digging
the crazy genius vibe.

13:12.992 --> 13:15.862
Oh, what's this,
one of your inventions?

13:15.862 --> 13:18.765
Oh, no my Mom gave it to me,
I have no idea what it is.

13:18.765 --> 13:20.533
Look, are you gonna turn me in?

13:20.533 --> 13:23.569
Turn you--what?
No, I came here to thank you

13:23.569 --> 13:26.906
for saving me from that,
uh, electrical lady!

13:26.906 --> 13:29.108
I woulda been deader
than bedazzled denim

13:29.108 --> 13:30.777
without you
and your big red buddy!

13:30.777 --> 13:33.246
Speaking of which, where
'ya keepin' Clifford, anyway?

13:33.246 --> 13:35.548
Where did he come from?
Do you have representation?

13:35.548 --> 13:36.716
Tell me everything!

13:45.458 --> 13:47.760
Then I thought,
"Who else is gonna do it?

13:47.760 --> 13:50.129
The fate of our community
is on the line here!"

13:50.129 --> 13:51.931
And like my mom always says:

13:51.931 --> 13:53.399
"One girl can make
a difference."

13:54.834 --> 13:56.903
So? Whaddaya think?

13:56.903 --> 13:58.571
- About you bein' a superhero?
- Yeah!

13:58.571 --> 13:59.939
- No.
- What?

13:59.939 --> 14:01.507
Not in that outfit.

14:01.507 --> 14:03.943
No client of mine
is going out like that.

14:03.943 --> 14:05.878
- Client?
- Full service management

14:05.878 --> 14:07.714
and public relations.
I can turn you

14:07.714 --> 14:10.850
into the most beloved
superheroes in the world!

14:10.850 --> 14:12.919
I'm talkin' digital marketing,

14:12.919 --> 14:14.787
viral videos,
personal appearances,

14:14.787 --> 14:16.255
merchandising opportunities.

14:16.255 --> 14:18.925
This lab is gonna make
a great playset!

14:18.925 --> 14:21.327
Playset?
Girl, have you lost your mind?

14:21.327 --> 14:22.895
I've been told
I can be a bit much,

14:22.895 --> 14:24.230
but honestly,
I don't see it.

14:24.230 --> 14:26.366
Look, you're gonna
inspire people,

14:26.366 --> 14:28.067
just like you inspired me.

14:28.067 --> 14:30.002
I can get
your message out there.

14:30.002 --> 14:32.238
I can help you help people!

14:32.238 --> 14:33.906
And you don't have
to pay me a cent.

14:33.906 --> 14:36.642
Social media followers
are my currency.

14:36.642 --> 14:38.544
Okay. A lot to take in.

14:38.544 --> 14:40.380
But... Hmm?

14:40.380 --> 14:43.783
- All right. let's do this thing!
- Yes!

15:21.020 --> 15:22.989
Zang!

15:22.989 --> 15:25.525
- We did the thang, thang!
- Yup. Yeah. We did.

15:25.525 --> 15:28.161
I can sell this.
Just one last detail:

15:28.161 --> 15:31.564
- Your superhero name!
- Hmm? Do I really need one?

15:31.564 --> 15:33.466
If you don't
take yourself seriously,

15:33.466 --> 15:35.234
no one else will.

15:35.234 --> 15:37.804
As for your costume Big Guy...

15:37.804 --> 15:40.473
Fine.
Go naked then.

15:42.041 --> 15:44.110
So,
until we can locate that,

15:44.110 --> 15:46.779
power-sucking,
you know, electrical lady,

15:46.779 --> 15:50.316
the best we can do is stop
blackout crime in its tracks.

15:53.820 --> 15:56.456
It's
trying to rob

15:56.456 --> 15:58.558
- How do you know?
- Let's just say.

15:58.558 --> 16:00.660
I've might have
put a sweet surprise

16:00.660 --> 16:02.328
inside of my security system.

16:02.328 --> 16:03.930
What do we do?
What do we do?

16:03.930 --> 16:05.631
- Uh, recon, then attack.
- Okay.

16:05.631 --> 16:07.600
While you capture it all
and make us famous?

16:07.600 --> 16:09.101
Yeah. Yeah, let's do that.

16:09.101 --> 16:12.171
Hey, totally unrelated,
but my hands are shaking.

16:12.171 --> 16:14.907
Oh, my everything is shaking.

16:14.907 --> 16:16.709
But my grandma once told me

16:16.709 --> 16:19.846
bravery is what you do
when you're flat-out scared.

16:19.846 --> 16:21.848
Aw, old people are the best.

16:21.848 --> 16:23.649
I know. My grandma is so cute.

16:23.649 --> 16:25.184
Okay. Let's do this.

16:25.184 --> 16:27.954
Uh, stop right there.

16:27.954 --> 16:29.655
And you are...

16:29.655 --> 16:32.692
All you need to know
is I'm a superhero,

16:32.692 --> 16:36.529
my turf's the LES,
and you're messin' with it.

16:36.529 --> 16:37.897
A superhero?

16:37.897 --> 16:39.532
And you don't even have a name?

16:39.532 --> 16:41.500
Look, if you don't take
yourself seriously,

16:41.500 --> 16:43.603
- no one else will.
- But that's what I said!

16:43.603 --> 16:45.104
- Sorry...
- Casey!

16:45.104 --> 16:47.273
- Sorry.
- Well, bet my friend

16:47.273 --> 16:49.141
will make you take me seriously!

16:49.141 --> 16:50.610
Who, the gym guy?

16:53.846 --> 16:55.214
For real?

16:58.851 --> 17:00.887
Dumpster mouth.

17:00.887 --> 17:04.624
It's not good.

17:04.624 --> 17:05.625
What are you doing?

17:07.426 --> 17:10.496
Yeah. So, uh, we're gonna
go ahead and leave now.

17:13.699 --> 17:15.635
No!

17:16.969 --> 17:19.939
Well, good luck
with all the superheroing!

17:21.240 --> 17:25.111
Don't worry.
It's okay! My phone is fine.

17:25.111 --> 17:27.947
But I am definitely
deleting this video.

17:29.649 --> 17:31.817
If I don't
clean up this crime,

17:31.817 --> 17:33.920
the LES is gonna
keep goin' downhill,

17:33.920 --> 17:35.554
my parents are gonna have
to sell the rink.

17:35.554 --> 17:38.124
And next thing 'ya know
I'm moving to Jersey!

17:38.124 --> 17:40.059
- No disrespect to Jersey.
- No, of course not.

17:40.059 --> 17:41.794
We can't let that happen.

17:41.794 --> 17:43.162
I won't let that happen.

17:43.162 --> 17:46.165
Oh, thank you.
I have an idea.

17:46.165 --> 17:48.501
Your part involves
some high-level messing around

17:48.501 --> 17:50.836
- on the internet.
- Or as I call it, Tuesday.

17:50.836 --> 17:52.405
What are you gonna do?

17:52.405 --> 17:54.941
Oh, I'm gonna get

17:54.941 --> 17:57.910
this super-team in super-synch.

18:05.618 --> 18:07.486
<i>Oh, yeah! ♪</i>

18:19.665 --> 18:20.666
Whoo, yeah!

18:29.742 --> 18:31.777
Seriously?

18:31.777 --> 18:33.879
As Bubbe Bina would say,

18:33.879 --> 18:36.382
"You're a real bondit,
y'know that?"

18:36.382 --> 18:38.451
Oh, it means,

18:38.451 --> 18:41.087
just like, you know,
rascal, devilish.

18:41.087 --> 18:44.023
Hey, what's your name anyway?

18:51.897 --> 18:54.033
That will not fit on a t-shirt.

18:59.872 --> 19:03.909
Bam! Thanks
to my mad internet skills,

19:03.909 --> 19:05.444
I found the robbers
trying to auction

19:05.444 --> 19:07.013
all the stolen stuffs
on the web.

19:07.013 --> 19:08.848
I snagged their address.

19:08.848 --> 19:10.783
Oh, that's lit, Casey!

19:10.783 --> 19:14.153
Yeah. So, what have
you been up to?

19:14.153 --> 19:16.989
Oh, you know,
I just trained an apex predator,

19:16.989 --> 19:18.958
mastered my gadgets,
and became fluent

19:18.958 --> 19:21.193
in dino-saurian.
I even learned his name.

19:21.193 --> 19:22.928
The literal translation is:

19:22.928 --> 19:24.664
"Terrifying Fire Beast

19:24.664 --> 19:26.966
Who Will Bring About The End
of All Things."

19:28.134 --> 19:30.069
But, but, but hear me out.
We discussed it,

19:30.069 --> 19:31.837
and we're gonna go
with "Devil" for short.

19:31.837 --> 19:34.006
Devil? Devil?

19:34.006 --> 19:36.042
- Yeah, I can work with that.
- Oh, all right.

19:36.042 --> 19:37.510
Then, what are we waiting for?

19:45.918 --> 19:48.421
Oh, man. Be honest,
how's it look?

19:48.421 --> 19:50.389
I believe the adjective

19:50.389 --> 19:52.892
he's searching for is "smurfy."

19:52.892 --> 19:55.161
Really? Little miss "superhero"

19:55.161 --> 19:57.930
without a name,
back for more humiliation?

19:57.930 --> 19:59.832
I did pick one name.

19:59.832 --> 20:01.434
Devil!

20:07.506 --> 20:08.841
Fetch.

20:08.841 --> 20:10.609
Attaboy!

20:15.648 --> 20:18.584
Devil. Leave it.

20:18.584 --> 20:21.620
- Come on. Listen to mama...
- No, don't listen to mama.

20:21.620 --> 20:23.589
- Yummy cold cuts.
- You got this, Devil.

20:23.589 --> 20:26.025
- Mmmmm-mmmm.
- Come on, you got this.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.236
Oh, yes, yes, yes!

20:37.236 --> 20:38.838
Oh, who is my good boy?

20:38.838 --> 20:40.506
You are!

20:41.740 --> 20:44.844
The one
who never talks is getting away!

20:54.653 --> 20:57.022
Oh, got him!

20:57.022 --> 21:00.025
I'm definitely
not deleting this video.

21:03.095 --> 21:05.798
- The Electrical Lady!
- Hey, hey, hey.

21:05.798 --> 21:07.500
My name isn't lady.

21:07.500 --> 21:09.135
It's Aftershock.

21:09.135 --> 21:11.704
Oh, look at you!

21:11.704 --> 21:14.173
That cosplay is ADORBS.

21:14.173 --> 21:15.941
Who're you supposed to be?

21:15.941 --> 21:17.409
Well, I'm...

21:19.745 --> 21:21.247
Boy, don't even.

21:21.247 --> 21:22.882
Okay, you work on that.

21:22.882 --> 21:25.151
Gotta jet.
I do have a day job.

21:25.151 --> 21:27.987
That's right,
a gal can do it all! bye.

21:34.126 --> 21:36.095
Enjoy the win, will 'ya?

21:36.095 --> 21:39.331
The big takeaway
is we superheroed!

21:39.331 --> 21:41.934
And don't stress about the name,
we'll sleep on it,

21:41.934 --> 21:43.736
maybe do
some guided meditation...

21:43.736 --> 21:45.337
Moon Girl.

21:48.140 --> 21:51.744
I'm gonna be Moon Girl.

21:54.313 --> 21:57.483
Moon Girl And Devil Dinosaur!

21:59.885 --> 22:01.453
And Casey.

22:12.164 --> 22:14.934
Aight, new mission:
Stop Aftershock,

22:14.934 --> 22:17.236
stop the blackouts,
and save the LES!

22:17.236 --> 22:19.672
But first we gotta find her.

22:19.672 --> 22:22.741
So Imma upcycle
whatever this thing is.

22:26.946 --> 22:30.916
Check it,
the Multispectrum Moon Scanner!

22:30.916 --> 22:33.919
It's gonna take a while to
isolate her energy signature.

22:33.919 --> 22:36.088
But until we do,
we can give folks a hand

22:36.088 --> 22:37.756
around the Lower East Side!

23:21.200 --> 23:22.268
Come on.

23:59.571 --> 24:00.506
Now, D.

24:03.375 --> 24:05.210
That's right Electrical Lady!

24:05.210 --> 24:07.613
It's time for you to bounce,

24:07.613 --> 24:09.081
outta the Lower East Side!

24:14.520 --> 24:15.754
Devil.

24:15.754 --> 24:17.589
Sorry to burst your bubble.

24:21.460 --> 24:23.662
Oh snap.
Dear, are we dead?

24:23.662 --> 24:25.030
Oh.

24:27.866 --> 24:29.702
Okay, not dead...

24:38.010 --> 24:39.912
Skitter skitter skitter!

24:39.912 --> 24:41.447
Uh-huh.
Enough o' this noise.

24:53.592 --> 24:56.261
Holy puberty!
You're just a kid?

24:56.261 --> 24:58.797
A-doy. Moon GIRL?

24:58.797 --> 25:00.933
It's right in the name, lady.

25:00.933 --> 25:02.935
Oh, I could never hurt a child.

25:04.002 --> 25:05.938
But I should at least try.

25:10.843 --> 25:11.977
Devil!

25:15.547 --> 25:18.050
Devil! Say something!

25:18.050 --> 25:20.152
Oh, no, no. Okay.

25:20.152 --> 25:23.155
Okay. Come on. Get up.
We gotta get outta here.

25:28.894 --> 25:32.731
Oh, no, no. Don't lick it.

25:32.731 --> 25:34.199
Oh, no.

25:34.199 --> 25:36.668
Now get some rest.

25:36.668 --> 25:38.270
It'll be okay.

25:39.772 --> 25:41.774
What are we gonna do, Casey?

25:41.774 --> 25:43.709
Devil's hurt so bad.

25:43.709 --> 25:44.777
Are we in over our heads?

25:44.777 --> 25:46.779
I...

25:46.779 --> 25:48.914
No.

25:48.914 --> 25:51.683
I don't know.
We'll figure it out.

25:53.352 --> 25:55.854
<i>Lunella isn't up yet?
It's almost time for school!</i>

25:55.854 --> 25:58.690
Ai-yikes. We gotta go.

25:58.690 --> 26:01.727
Heal up.
I'll check on you later, okay?

26:05.998 --> 26:08.267
- Now not too runny, James.
- Ma, I know.

26:08.267 --> 26:09.902
<i>The Lower East Side experienced</i>

26:09.902 --> 26:11.937
<i>yet another blackout overnight.</i>

26:11.937 --> 26:13.906
<i>"And Moon Girl
and Devil Dinosaur"</i>

26:13.906 --> 26:15.174
<i>were spotted fleeing the scene.</i>

26:15.174 --> 26:17.476
What? Not Moon Girl! No.

26:17.476 --> 26:19.611
She did so much good
for folks around here!

26:19.611 --> 26:21.246
I don't buy it.
She can't be behind this.

26:21.246 --> 26:23.315
Told ya it was that
no-good dino!

26:23.315 --> 26:25.217
I bet he dragged her into it.

26:25.217 --> 26:27.252
His name ain't Angel Dinosaur.

26:27.252 --> 26:29.988
I just wonder
where the parents are.

26:29.988 --> 26:31.657
They gotta be all kinds
o' dumb to not know

26:31.657 --> 26:32.825
what their own kid is up to.

26:32.825 --> 26:34.993
Let's not rush to judgment.

26:34.993 --> 26:36.728
We may not have
the full story yet.

26:36.728 --> 26:38.864
Hi Mom. HI Dad. Hi Pops.
Hi Mimi. Sorry late for school!

26:38.864 --> 26:40.766
Lunella!

26:40.766 --> 26:42.868
So, ah, protons

26:42.868 --> 26:44.903
and electrons are like, uh...

26:44.903 --> 26:47.372
I guess like
you're offense and defense.

26:47.372 --> 26:50.309
If you lose an electron,
it's like a red card in soccer,

26:50.309 --> 26:52.711
it puts ya down a player.
Then, waddaya gonna do, right?

26:52.711 --> 26:56.181
Soccer is boring.

26:56.181 --> 26:58.851
Oh, though
Megan Rapinoe's pretty rad...

26:58.851 --> 27:02.421
And your analogy
was pretty "rad" too, Coach.

27:03.822 --> 27:06.291
I'm Ms. Dillon,
the new science teacher.

27:06.291 --> 27:07.926
Hooray, you're saved!

27:07.926 --> 27:09.495
Oh, praise Jeter.

27:09.495 --> 27:11.330
I was runnin'
outta sports analogies.

27:11.330 --> 27:13.499
Well, you just rest
that cute lil' noggin o' yours

27:13.499 --> 27:16.101
and pass the baton to me.

27:16.101 --> 27:17.903
- See what I did there?
- Oh yeah, nice!

27:17.903 --> 27:19.771
And hey, if you ever get stuck,

27:19.771 --> 27:24.009
just ask our resident genius,
Lunella Lafayette!

27:24.009 --> 27:25.811
She's as smart as they come!

27:27.813 --> 27:32.251
Oh, I'm sure she is.

27:38.924 --> 27:42.494
Could you stay after class
a minute, Lunella Lafayette?

27:42.494 --> 27:43.829
Oh!

27:43.829 --> 27:45.764
Get stuffed, Eduardo.

27:47.566 --> 27:49.535
What are you doing here?

27:49.535 --> 27:50.903
Oh, me?

27:50.903 --> 27:53.172
Why, the Lower East Side
is my home now.

27:53.172 --> 27:54.907
Su casa, mi casa!

27:54.907 --> 27:56.909
But you're stealing
all our power!

27:56.909 --> 27:58.944
And 'cause no one
gives a rip about us,

27:58.944 --> 28:00.345
you think we're easy pickings!

28:00.345 --> 28:02.381
Oh, to quote you,
"A-doy."

28:02.381 --> 28:04.116
And being a
disarmingly-attractive

28:04.116 --> 28:06.084
science teacher
is the perfect cover.

28:06.084 --> 28:08.153
Plus there's
a handy charging spot

28:08.153 --> 28:10.656
right around the corner,
so I can hit it before dinner!

28:11.924 --> 28:14.526
Read the room, Eduardo!
Get out!

28:14.526 --> 28:15.861
Forgot my basketball!

28:15.861 --> 28:17.796
Jeez, so touchy.

28:17.796 --> 28:19.398
You must really be in trouble!

28:19.398 --> 28:22.167
Listen up, Geek Lightning.

28:22.167 --> 28:24.937
I'm not gonna let you bleed
the Lower East Side dry.

28:24.937 --> 28:26.238
- Devil and I are gonna--
- Bup-bup-bup-bup.

28:26.238 --> 28:28.173
Let me stop you right there,
fun size.

28:28.173 --> 28:30.776
First of all, 'Geek Lightning'
was surprisingly hurtful.

28:30.776 --> 28:34.012
Second, if I don't get
my daily jolt, I lose my power.

28:34.012 --> 28:36.181
Ma mojo, ya feel me?

28:36.181 --> 28:39.017
And that ain't happening.
You want an "A" in my class?

28:39.017 --> 28:41.920
Then, hang up your cape
and stop annoying me.

28:41.920 --> 28:43.789
You're not a real superhero.

28:43.789 --> 28:45.524
You're not a real blonde.

28:45.524 --> 28:48.894
Okay that just got
you an "F" for today.

28:48.894 --> 28:51.063
Happy? Now, do the Math on this.

28:56.935 --> 29:00.906
I'm far more powerful
than you'll ever be.

29:00.906 --> 29:03.575
So step off or
I'll do to your family

29:03.575 --> 29:05.244
what I did to your dinosaur.

29:10.282 --> 29:12.985
And be sure to read
chapter five by tomorrow, okay?

29:27.966 --> 29:29.635
- What?
- Yeah.

29:29.635 --> 29:30.969
She's my teacher now.

29:30.969 --> 29:34.272
So glad I'm not
in fifth period science.

29:34.272 --> 29:37.109
Okay, new plan: You build
a gadget to blast her butt,

29:37.109 --> 29:38.644
I'll get the keys
to the teacher's lounge,

29:38.644 --> 29:39.811
then we hide in there 'til she--

29:39.811 --> 29:42.047
No! We--

29:42.047 --> 29:44.282
- It's over, Casey.
- Huh?

29:44.282 --> 29:45.817
What's over?
What are you talking about?

29:45.817 --> 29:47.819
I mean, it's over.

29:47.819 --> 29:49.855
No more superheroing. All right?

29:49.855 --> 29:51.590
I put Devil in danger,

29:51.590 --> 29:53.692
and now my family's
in danger too.

29:53.692 --> 29:55.761
Oh, but you and Devil
were just finding your groove!

29:55.761 --> 29:57.796
You can handle this lady...

29:57.796 --> 30:00.899
Look at him!

30:00.899 --> 30:02.868
He didn't ask for any of this.

30:02.868 --> 30:04.403
It's my fault he's even here.

30:04.403 --> 30:08.006
So I have to send him back.

30:08.006 --> 30:10.475
It's what's best for him,
he'll be safer at home.

30:10.475 --> 30:13.712
You don't know that.
Oh, we can figure this out.

30:13.712 --> 30:14.780
There's gotta be a way.

30:14.780 --> 30:16.848
Casey. No.

30:16.848 --> 30:19.318
Aftershock is just too powerful.

30:19.318 --> 30:22.287
And now she's got me boxed
into a corner.

30:22.287 --> 30:26.124
I can't fix this.

30:27.392 --> 30:30.962
Whatever happened to "One girl
can make a difference?" Huh?

30:30.962 --> 30:32.597
Was that just basura?

30:32.597 --> 30:34.766
I was wrong, okay?

30:34.766 --> 30:37.803
I got in way over my head,

30:37.803 --> 30:39.705
and I can't do this anymore.

30:39.705 --> 30:41.073
- But--
- I can't! Okay.

30:41.073 --> 30:42.607
Now stop pushing me!

30:46.411 --> 30:48.146
If that's the way you feel,

30:48.146 --> 30:50.716
then I guess
you don't need me either.

31:07.265 --> 31:09.401
I believed in you, you know.

31:20.879 --> 31:23.749
Hmm? You doin' okay, buddy?

31:25.817 --> 31:27.953
Hey, why don't I
put on some flicks

31:27.953 --> 31:29.855
and we can hang out.

31:29.855 --> 31:31.790
Just you and me.

31:33.658 --> 31:34.760
Big day tomorrow.

31:57.816 --> 32:01.586
Huh? Only enough juice
for a one way trip.

32:05.924 --> 32:07.659
Look, the thing is

32:07.659 --> 32:09.094
New York stinks, right?

32:09.094 --> 32:11.062
It's no place for a dinosaur.

32:11.062 --> 32:13.131
You oughta go home,

32:13.131 --> 32:14.766
where you'll be safe. Okay?

32:17.235 --> 32:19.171
Hey. Hey! Look!

32:20.872 --> 32:22.340
You hungry? Breakfast time?

32:22.340 --> 32:25.277
Nom nom nom! Go get 'em boy!

32:31.116 --> 32:33.251
Okay. fine. You want the truth?

32:33.251 --> 32:34.953
I don't want you anymore!

32:34.953 --> 32:36.721
You're nothing
but a pain in my butt!

32:36.721 --> 32:38.523
So go!

32:38.523 --> 32:39.925
Just get out!

32:39.925 --> 32:41.860
Just go, you big dumb lizard!

33:01.980 --> 33:03.148
Just go.

34:14.819 --> 34:18.256
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down, child. What's wrong?

34:18.256 --> 34:20.892
We're selling the rink!
And it's all because of me.

34:20.892 --> 34:22.827
Hold on. How you figure that?

34:22.827 --> 34:24.629
'Cause I'm--

34:24.629 --> 34:25.897
I fix things.

34:25.897 --> 34:27.899
You know,
that's what I'm good at.

34:27.899 --> 34:29.734
And I wanted to fix this too.

34:31.002 --> 34:33.972
If I'm supposed to be so smart,
why couldn't I figure it out?

34:36.675 --> 34:37.642
Come here.

34:38.843 --> 34:40.445
This is not on you.

34:40.445 --> 34:42.047
Even the smartest girl
in the world

34:42.047 --> 34:43.815
can't do everything.

34:43.815 --> 34:46.184
That's why you gotta lean
on the people who love you.

34:46.184 --> 34:49.888
You got me and Pops,
your Mom and Dad,

34:49.888 --> 34:52.057
and that new friend of yours, right?

34:52.057 --> 34:54.759
Yeah, Casey.

34:54.759 --> 34:56.995
Kinda messed that up too.

34:56.995 --> 34:59.130
Well, if you're lookin'
to fix somethin',

34:59.130 --> 35:01.399
it's never too late.

35:03.134 --> 35:05.136
You're right.

35:05.136 --> 35:06.304
Thanks, Mimi.

35:08.840 --> 35:11.509
- Oh!
- Oh!

35:11.509 --> 35:12.610
- Hi.
- Hi.

35:14.279 --> 35:15.914
- Yeah, I was comin' to see if--
- I was--

35:15.914 --> 35:18.383
This is kinda weird,
I was just goin' to--

35:18.383 --> 35:19.784
C'mon.

35:19.784 --> 35:22.153
Look, I--

35:22.153 --> 35:23.855
I'm sorry, Casey.

35:23.855 --> 35:25.290
I know I'm goin' through
some stuff,

35:25.290 --> 35:27.759
but I shouldn't have
taken it out on you.

35:27.759 --> 35:30.061
I shouldn't have pushed you
and Devil away.

35:30.061 --> 35:31.963
No, me too,

35:31.963 --> 35:34.132
I get where
you were coming from.

35:34.132 --> 35:36.101
And don't worry,
I took down the website,

35:36.101 --> 35:38.603
tossed the costume,
all that junk.

35:38.603 --> 35:40.638
Guess I can be a bit much.

35:40.638 --> 35:44.709
I think you're exactly
the right amount.

35:44.709 --> 35:47.846
Y'know, you're pretty much
the first real friend

35:47.846 --> 35:49.714
I ever had, Lu.

35:49.714 --> 35:52.951
you too, Case.

35:52.951 --> 35:56.821
O-M-G. Do we have nicknames now?

35:56.821 --> 35:57.989
I guess so!

35:57.989 --> 36:00.058
Oh, it finally happened!

36:00.058 --> 36:02.427
I've been dreaming
about this day.

36:03.695 --> 36:07.265
I don't know if I have
a chance against Aftershock.

36:07.265 --> 36:10.135
And I don't know
what'll happen if I fail.

36:10.135 --> 36:12.837
But I know what'll happen
if I don't even try.

36:12.837 --> 36:14.672
Lu? Are you sure?

36:14.672 --> 36:16.975
There's no one else to stick up
for the Lower East Side.

36:16.975 --> 36:18.643
Just me.

36:18.643 --> 36:22.313
Okay. I'm really glad
to hear that, because...

36:22.313 --> 36:24.182
I lied I never shut
the site down.

36:24.182 --> 36:27.252
Here's your costume.
Let's do this. Wo-hoo!

36:36.795 --> 36:39.264
Moon Girl Magic.

36:39.264 --> 36:41.599
Okay. No publicity
is bad publicity

36:41.599 --> 36:44.135
except when the whole city
thinks you're the bad guy!

36:44.135 --> 36:47.138
We gotta expose Aftershock
as the real villain.

36:47.138 --> 36:50.575
Luckily, she told me
when and where she recharges.

36:50.575 --> 36:52.877
There's a handy charging spot
right around the corners.

36:52.877 --> 36:54.546
So I can hit it before dinner.

36:54.546 --> 36:56.448
Loving the enthusiasm.

36:56.448 --> 36:59.217
But what if no one sees?
What if you can't take her out?

36:59.217 --> 37:02.120
Well, then we get canceled
after one episode.

37:04.122 --> 37:05.490
It's that Moon Girl

37:05.490 --> 37:07.125
Of course,
with all the blackout.

37:08.326 --> 37:10.595
Oh, boy.
Those kids got to her today.

37:10.595 --> 37:13.064
Oh, honey, I looked like that
my first week too,

37:13.064 --> 37:14.399
you got this.

37:19.437 --> 37:21.606
- Hey, watch it!
- What's she doin'?

37:21.606 --> 37:23.608
- Somebody stop her!
- You wanna stop me

37:23.608 --> 37:24.843
you gotta catch me!

37:24.843 --> 37:26.377
C'mon people!

37:32.851 --> 37:34.919
Yes.

37:34.919 --> 37:36.855
Mama needs a coffee.

37:36.855 --> 37:39.524
- What's goin on?
- Yo, it's Moon Girl!

37:43.828 --> 37:46.164
Oh, yeah. That's a good stuff.

37:46.164 --> 37:49.100
See? She's the real
cause of the blackouts!

37:49.100 --> 37:52.237
Rad! Ms. Dillon
is a supervillain?

37:52.237 --> 37:55.907
Aw man, now I gotta teach
science again.

37:55.907 --> 37:58.443
All right.
Electrical lady, let's dance!

37:58.443 --> 38:01.045
How 'bout
the electric slide?

38:04.249 --> 38:06.918
Hey! You come for them,
you're comin' for me!

38:06.918 --> 38:09.187
Um, okay then,
I'm comin' for you.

38:10.788 --> 38:13.892
Hey, where did you get that
old cassette player? Nice!

38:13.892 --> 38:15.660
That's what this thing is?

38:17.095 --> 38:19.030
Well, now,
it does a whole lot more,

38:19.030 --> 38:21.966
like hack into the park's
plumbing controls!

38:21.966 --> 38:24.836
Electricity and H-Two-Oh
don't mix, sister!

38:38.883 --> 38:41.753
What?! Really?
Dang internet lag!

38:46.791 --> 38:48.626
Sayonara, sister.

38:58.870 --> 38:59.938
Devil?

39:02.440 --> 39:03.975
You stayed?

39:03.975 --> 39:05.977
But that was your only chance
to get home.

39:09.781 --> 39:11.049
What did he say?

39:11.049 --> 39:13.918
He said, "This is his home now.

39:13.918 --> 39:15.820
And it's worth fighting for.

39:17.722 --> 39:19.490
I'm...

39:19.490 --> 39:22.293
...worth fighting for.

39:22.293 --> 39:26.064
Oh, I love you,
you big dumb lizard!

39:26.064 --> 39:27.899
Oh, my baby.

39:27.899 --> 39:29.334
This is my best work.

39:29.334 --> 39:31.870
Okay everyone, that's a wrap.

39:32.870 --> 39:35.673
Time for some reshoots!

39:35.673 --> 39:38.243
Devil run!

39:38.243 --> 39:39.878
Check back
for more Moon Girl content.

39:39.878 --> 39:42.180
Like and subscribe. Bye.

39:42.180 --> 39:44.816
What are you gonna do?
She's like living lightning!

39:44.816 --> 39:47.819
Oh, that's it! If she's like
lightning, we gotta ground her!

39:47.819 --> 39:49.954
Y'mean, send her to her room
and take away her phone?

39:49.954 --> 39:51.823
No, no, no,
electrical grounding!

39:51.823 --> 39:54.025
We hit her with a metal
lightning rod that's connected

39:54.025 --> 39:56.094
to a wire leading to a grid
under the ground!

39:56.094 --> 39:58.162
If it works, all her electricity

39:58.162 --> 40:02.000
will be absorbed
and dissipated safely! Science!

40:02.000 --> 40:05.136
We just need
a big enough lightning rod.

40:05.136 --> 40:06.971
Okay D, listen up.

40:08.172 --> 40:09.741
Ready, break!

40:25.790 --> 40:27.792
<i>♪ Oh, feet touched

40:27.792 --> 40:29.794
