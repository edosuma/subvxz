00:01.827 --> 00:03.829
Last time on <i>Naomi...</i>

00:03.873 --> 00:05.788
March 14, 2004.

00:05.831 --> 00:08.051
I saw the light in the sky.

00:08.095 --> 00:09.879
That's when I first sensed you.

00:09.922 --> 00:12.360
<i>My whole life has</i> <i>
been about being different,</i>

00:12.403 --> 00:16.538
<i>and now I'm supposed to accept</i> <i>
the fact that I'm literally</i> <i>
an alien from outer space.</i>

00:16.581 --> 00:18.975
Before you were just
not ready to face the truth.

00:19.019 --> 00:20.672
I just want to be normal.

00:20.716 --> 00:24.198
You are a lot of things, babe,
but normal is not one of them.

00:24.241 --> 00:26.852
You, Naomi McDuffie,
are exceptional.

00:26.896 --> 00:29.029
Dee, I think I have powers.

00:29.072 --> 00:30.552
I can help you with that.

00:32.119 --> 00:33.511
<i>Daddy, look at this one.</i>

00:33.555 --> 00:35.252
<i>That's a cute</i> <i>
baby turtle.</i>

00:35.296 --> 00:37.472
<i>It's not a baby, Daddy.</i> <i>
It's a grown-up.</i>

00:37.515 --> 00:39.735
<i>See, it has all these rings</i> <i>
on its shell.</i>

00:39.778 --> 00:42.781
<i>You're right.
I'm gonna go</i> <i>
put it back in its home.</i>

00:42.825 --> 00:45.045
<i>Can you tell us what</i> <i>
you're doing out here, Naomi?</i>

00:45.088 --> 00:47.047
<i>I'm saving the world.</i>

00:47.090 --> 00:50.311
<i>You sure are, pumpkin.</i>

00:51.138 --> 00:52.661
Is this about college week?

00:55.446 --> 01:01.104
No. Can't your parents
just pull out keepsakes
on a random Tuesday?

01:01.148 --> 01:03.759
Dad, you're wearing
your Hartford shirt.

01:06.718 --> 01:07.589
Busted.

01:08.329 --> 01:10.374
We're just excited.

01:10.418 --> 01:13.769
You've been talking
about Hartford since you were
practically in diapers.

01:13.812 --> 01:17.381
And now here you are,
making your dreams come true.

01:17.425 --> 01:20.645
It's not for sure yet.
I haven't even finished
my admissions essay.

01:20.689 --> 01:25.172
Really? I would've thought
you would have had
five drafts done by now.

01:25.955 --> 01:27.652
I've just been busy.

01:27.696 --> 01:30.394
Also, I'm only a junior.
A lot can happen.

01:30.438 --> 01:33.919
What if I don't get in?
What if I change my mind?

01:33.963 --> 01:35.878
About Hartford? Right.

01:35.921 --> 01:39.534
Don't you remember
all those spreadsheets?
Checks all the boxes.

01:39.577 --> 01:43.364
That great engineering program,
great, great bio program.

01:43.407 --> 01:45.714
Close to the mountains,
to the coast.

01:45.757 --> 01:48.456
I know.
It has everything I wanted.

01:50.849 --> 01:52.155
Is that my report card?

01:52.199 --> 01:54.114
First grade.

01:54.157 --> 01:58.814
A in Math,
A in Reading, A in Science,
award for Best Personality.

01:58.857 --> 02:01.033
Oh, we were so proud.

02:01.077 --> 02:03.079
Every kid in class
got an award.

02:03.123 --> 02:05.125
But did they get
Best Personality?

02:05.168 --> 02:06.517
Mmm-hmm.
Mmm.

02:08.911 --> 02:11.522
I can't believe
you guys kept all of this.

02:15.004 --> 02:18.877
I can't believe our little girl
is all grown up.

02:18.921 --> 02:23.317
But no matter how old you get,
you will always be our Naomi.

02:42.727 --> 02:45.426

03:22.506 --> 03:24.291
Well, you wasted
the element of surprise.

03:24.334 --> 03:28.425
So either you're going soft
or you want something from me.

03:28.469 --> 03:30.035
Take it as a sign of respect.

03:30.079 --> 03:32.777
Respect? Right.

03:35.302 --> 03:37.565
Sixteen years
isn't long enough to forget.

03:38.305 --> 03:39.828
Or forgive.

03:39.871 --> 03:42.526
I didn't expect to find you
in a place like this.

03:42.570 --> 03:44.615
I hate this planet.

03:44.659 --> 03:49.054
The noise, the food, people...

03:49.098 --> 03:52.232
This is the only place
that makes me feel
a little bit sane.

03:56.366 --> 03:58.238
How did you find me?

04:00.196 --> 04:02.459
The same way we find everyone.

04:03.939 --> 04:05.027
You have the disk?

04:09.945 --> 04:12.991
And just when I thought
things couldn't get any worse.

04:13.035 --> 04:15.516
I didn't just
find the disk, Akira.

04:16.386 --> 04:17.474
I found the girl.

04:19.520 --> 04:22.610
- You stay away from her.
- You know I can't do that.

04:24.568 --> 04:26.918
Her powers
are beginning to manifest.

04:26.962 --> 04:28.311
We can use her.

04:28.355 --> 04:29.834
But she's a danger.

04:31.140 --> 04:32.272
Doesn't matter.

04:33.795 --> 04:35.927
There was never
any avoiding that.

04:35.971 --> 04:39.191
I'm not talking about
people from our world.

04:39.235 --> 04:41.324
This world isn't safe anymore.

04:42.064 --> 04:43.370

05:38.773 --> 05:40.905
This is what's under
the tattoo shop?

05:42.080 --> 05:43.081
What is this place?

05:44.126 --> 05:45.127
I come here...

05:46.650 --> 05:49.261
to sharpen my skills.

05:49.305 --> 05:50.785
They look pretty sharp to me.

05:55.224 --> 05:56.878
Can you teach me
how to use these?

06:01.056 --> 06:03.058
These come later.

06:03.885 --> 06:05.539
This is your first session.

06:06.409 --> 06:07.715
You start with this.

06:10.848 --> 06:13.851
Bounce it on the floor,
alternate hands.

06:15.897 --> 06:18.639
Hold up. I thought
you were teaching me
how to use my powers.

06:20.467 --> 06:23.644
You have to walk
before you can run.

06:24.471 --> 06:26.864
My motto is start small.

06:26.908 --> 06:28.910
You had me jump off a bridge.

06:32.217 --> 06:34.306
True.

06:34.350 --> 06:39.573
Martial arts is about
being deliberate, precise.

06:40.269 --> 06:41.575
Control your body,

06:42.227 --> 06:43.577
control your mind,

06:44.621 --> 06:46.057
control your powers.

06:53.804 --> 06:55.980
I've been thinking
about that disk.

06:56.024 --> 06:58.200
Why don't you focus
on your drill.

06:58.243 --> 06:59.723
Right. I'm sorry.

07:06.208 --> 07:07.731
It's just...

07:07.775 --> 07:09.907
I saw those markings again
at the mill,

07:09.951 --> 07:13.389
and I feel like the disk
has something to do with me,

07:13.433 --> 07:15.130
with who I am
or where I'm from.

07:18.786 --> 07:20.570
Same thing, but faster.

07:25.662 --> 07:27.969
It's natural to want answers.

07:34.105 --> 07:36.978
But you're not gonna get them
from Zumbado.

07:38.762 --> 07:40.590
It's best you leave it alone.

07:40.634 --> 07:42.157
I can handle it.

07:43.506 --> 07:47.118
Yes, one day.

07:47.162 --> 07:51.079
Having powers doesn't mean
you're ready to use them.

07:51.122 --> 07:52.254
It takes time.

07:55.213 --> 07:56.258
Patience.

08:01.350 --> 08:04.919
Fame and money is nice,
but it's not about that.

08:06.007 --> 08:07.312
Soccer's my rock.

08:07.356 --> 08:09.314
It's the one thing
that's never changed for me.

08:09.358 --> 08:12.274
Robots are changing everything.

08:12.317 --> 08:14.668
I want to build a robot
that goes to Mars.

08:14.711 --> 08:18.236
I'm gonna be the next Bezos.
That's my ten-year plan.

08:18.280 --> 08:22.327
I wanna use
my Architecture degree
to revitalize Port Oswego.

08:22.371 --> 08:23.807
I'm more in the browsing stage.

08:23.851 --> 08:26.984
Professional ukelele player,
park ranger, chemist.

08:27.028 --> 08:30.074
My plans have been the same
since I was eight years old.

08:30.118 --> 08:33.730
Become an environmental scientist,
specialize in geoengineering.

08:33.774 --> 08:37.647
The global climate crisis
is the greatest challenge
humanity's ever faced.

08:38.648 --> 08:39.997
I'm gonna help fix it.

08:40.041 --> 08:41.825
Those are
lofty goals.

08:41.869 --> 08:45.612
It's gonna take
complete dedication
to achieve them.

08:45.655 --> 08:48.571
Is that something
you're ready to commit to,
Miss McDuffie?

08:49.877 --> 08:52.880
- Absolutely.
- Fantastic.

08:52.923 --> 08:55.665
I think Hartford would be
a great fit for you.

08:55.709 --> 08:57.537
I look forward
to reading your essay.

09:04.979 --> 09:07.285
<i>What am I</i> <i>
supposed to write about?</i>

09:07.329 --> 09:09.200
"Hi, I'm Naomi.

09:09.244 --> 09:12.682
My special skills include
blowing up light bulbs
and jumping off bridges"?

09:12.726 --> 09:14.858
Um, that actually
sounds awesome.

09:15.859 --> 09:17.992
You know,
college isn't mandatory.

09:26.043 --> 09:27.305
She's alone.

09:27.349 --> 09:29.090
Is this gonna work?

09:29.133 --> 09:31.440
Last month
when I was fundraising
for the junior class trip,

09:31.483 --> 09:34.356
Mrs. Anderson tried to
convince me to give her
a two-for-one deal

09:34.399 --> 09:36.445
on $5 wrapping paper.

09:36.488 --> 09:37.707
It's gonna work.

09:40.971 --> 09:43.321
You have to come over
and see my mom's new car.

09:43.365 --> 09:45.497
I mean, it has
seat warmers, cup holders

09:45.541 --> 09:47.064
and did I mention the sunroof?

09:47.108 --> 09:50.241
It's basically
a luxury vehicle.

09:50.285 --> 09:52.200
It's a used car, right?

09:52.243 --> 09:56.596
Oh, yeah,
extremely used.
Previous owners galore.

09:56.639 --> 09:57.858
But the best part?

09:57.901 --> 10:01.426
Zumbado gave my mom
a 20% discount.

10:01.470 --> 10:03.864
Some kind of locals-only deal.

10:06.649 --> 10:08.085
Something wrong, Mrs. Anderson?

10:09.565 --> 10:10.827
I'll say.

10:10.871 --> 10:14.439
I bought a car
from Zumbado last week.

10:14.483 --> 10:18.182
He didn't breathe a word
about any discount.

10:18.226 --> 10:21.751
And I've lived in this town
my whole life.

10:21.795 --> 10:23.753
I'm gonna call him
right now.

10:23.797 --> 10:26.147
Oh, no, no, no.
You shouldn't call him.
That lets him off the hook.

10:26.190 --> 10:29.150
The real power move
is to go to him face to face.

10:30.368 --> 10:31.369
Power move.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.982
We could go with you
if you want.

10:35.025 --> 10:39.464
Mrs. Anderson, I assure you
that I have never offered
a locals discount.

10:39.508 --> 10:40.901
If I did, I'd go bankrupt.

10:40.944 --> 10:42.685
I'm a small-business owner
just like you.

10:42.729 --> 10:44.948
I will not be made
a fool of, sir.

10:44.992 --> 10:47.211
- That was not my intention.
Mrs. Anderson?

10:47.255 --> 10:49.170
Maybe you should go
look around the lot.

10:49.213 --> 10:51.172
See if there's something
cheaper you'd like.

10:52.216 --> 10:53.217
Yes.

10:54.610 --> 10:56.090
That's a wonderful idea.

10:57.265 --> 10:58.266
Of course.

11:03.880 --> 11:05.186
Right this way.

11:19.243 --> 11:20.244
Go, go, go!

11:33.562 --> 11:36.304
Please don't blow up.
Please don't blow up.

11:46.575 --> 11:49.491
Babe, did you just open
that safe with your mind?

11:59.370 --> 12:01.111
Naomi, come on!
Let's go!

12:33.187 --> 12:36.799
- Our future awaits.

12:36.843 --> 12:40.585
These markings are giving me
real <i>Hellraiser</i> vibes.

12:40.629 --> 12:43.632
It has to be
some kind of language.

12:43.675 --> 12:46.417
MIT has prototypes of
a computer decipherment
program online,

12:46.461 --> 12:48.680
but the sample size
is way too small.

12:48.724 --> 12:50.857
Might be hieroglyphics.

12:50.900 --> 12:54.077
But there aren't any
logographic elements.

12:54.121 --> 12:56.776
You know who probably has
some great insight on this?

12:56.819 --> 12:58.821
Your mom, the linguist.

12:58.865 --> 13:02.129
I can't tell my mom
because then I'd have to
tell her about my...

13:03.870 --> 13:05.349
the disk.

13:05.393 --> 13:09.919
I think she'd be very happy
to learn about the disk.

13:09.963 --> 13:12.095
Jen is very understanding.

13:12.139 --> 13:15.620
Or telling her about the disk
will ruin everything.

13:15.664 --> 13:19.102
These markings should have
weakened the material,
but they didn't.

13:19.146 --> 13:20.974
I would love to analyze this.

13:21.975 --> 13:24.064
Jacob, you're a genius.

13:24.107 --> 13:27.632
Doesn't Central Oregon have,
like, a pretty advanced
geology department?

13:27.676 --> 13:30.461
Almost as good as robotics.

13:30.505 --> 13:32.986
I think we need to add
another stop on the tour.

13:36.337 --> 13:38.556
And to our right
is the alumni house.

13:38.600 --> 13:42.299
Built in 1902,
it is the oldest building
on campus.

13:45.563 --> 13:47.652
The geology building
is just up ahead.

13:47.696 --> 13:51.047
I'm gonna sneak off,
find the lab, and I'll be back
as soon as I can.

13:51.091 --> 13:52.701
Can you cover for me?

13:52.744 --> 13:55.399
Please, it's like asking LeBron
to not play basketball.

13:55.443 --> 13:56.531
He's good, right?

13:56.574 --> 13:59.795
I'm definitely coming.
Robots can wait.

13:59.839 --> 14:02.624
Besides, you need me
to run analysis.

14:02.667 --> 14:05.235
Okay. Then, who's gonna
cover for us?

14:12.590 --> 14:14.027
Hey.

14:14.070 --> 14:15.245
We need to ditch the tour.
Can you cover for us?

14:15.289 --> 14:17.378
No way.
This school's boring.

14:17.421 --> 14:19.206
I am never
playing soccer here.

14:19.249 --> 14:20.990
If you're ditching,
I'm coming.

14:26.735 --> 14:28.171
Hey, guys.

14:28.215 --> 14:30.086
We need you
to cover for us.

14:30.130 --> 14:32.872
Whatever's happening, I'm in.
I do not wanna go
to business school.

14:32.915 --> 14:34.482
Someone has to cover.

14:34.525 --> 14:35.613
Well, it can't be LeBron.

14:35.657 --> 14:38.007
- I'm the analysis guy.
- He joined last.

14:38.051 --> 14:39.530
I don't wanna be left out.

14:41.228 --> 14:43.970
Hey, guys,
I think you're good.
What are you doing?

14:44.013 --> 14:45.536
Lourdes, hi!

14:45.580 --> 14:46.842
What are you doing here?

14:46.886 --> 14:49.149
Uh, nice to
see you too, Nathan.

14:49.192 --> 14:50.977
Um, I have check-ins
with Mrs. Varady.

14:51.020 --> 14:53.327
She strongly encouraged me
to attend.

14:53.370 --> 14:55.155
Wait, but you don't even
go to school.

14:55.198 --> 14:57.722
That doesn't mean
she can't go to college.

14:57.766 --> 15:01.901
Lourdes is almost finished
with her GED, which means
she's way ahead of all of us.

15:01.944 --> 15:03.641
Thanks, Naomi.

15:03.685 --> 15:05.078
Any more questions?

15:07.210 --> 15:10.735
So, really, what are we doing?

15:10.779 --> 15:14.000
Do you remember that disk
we were trying to get back
from Zumbado's?

15:14.609 --> 15:15.740
I have it.

15:15.784 --> 15:17.307
How?

15:17.351 --> 15:19.048
I'm guessing
he didn't just give it to you.

15:19.092 --> 15:22.182
It's a long story
involving cars and fear.

15:23.923 --> 15:26.403
I'm gonna sneak into
the geology lab to analyze it.

15:26.447 --> 15:28.405
But I don't want any of you
getting in trouble.

15:28.449 --> 15:30.930
That sounds way more fun
than the tour.

15:43.029 --> 15:44.508
What is this?

15:44.552 --> 15:46.032
Break-in clothes.

15:46.075 --> 15:48.599
This sneaking around thing
is really becoming a habit.

16:06.052 --> 16:08.358
Never forget
the secret compartment.

16:26.202 --> 16:28.117
What is this thing?

16:28.161 --> 16:30.641
This is the Inductively coupled
plasma-atomic
emission spectrometer

16:30.685 --> 16:32.295
- they used on Mars.

16:32.339 --> 16:36.430
It performs laser-induced
breakdown spectroscopy.

16:36.473 --> 16:40.825
We're zapping
the disk with lasers
to find out what it's made of.

16:40.869 --> 16:42.175
That's kind of awesome.

17:03.631 --> 17:05.850
Huh. That's weird.

17:05.894 --> 17:07.678
It's not returning any data.

17:07.722 --> 17:08.897
It's impossible.

17:10.725 --> 17:12.466
Uh, hon,
is your super-cool machine
supposed to do that?

17:20.387 --> 17:23.259
- Is everyone okay?

17:23.303 --> 17:25.174
I... I think it's time to go.

17:30.658 --> 17:32.138
What the hell?

17:32.181 --> 17:34.401
- The disk is gone.
Naomi,
we gotta go!

17:46.108 --> 17:48.023
This is why
they sit you out here.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.503
Public shaming.

17:49.546 --> 17:52.767
Wow. I guess I am
gonna be valedictorian.

17:56.988 --> 17:59.643
I'm sorry, guys.
This is on me.
I'll take the blame.

17:59.687 --> 18:02.385
You didn't exactly
twist our arms.

18:02.429 --> 18:05.649
We should be okay.
None of us have really
been in trouble before.

18:05.693 --> 18:08.783
Or they go hard on us
to set an example.

18:08.826 --> 18:10.524
Suspension.

18:10.567 --> 18:12.265
Expulsion.

18:12.308 --> 18:14.267
That's one of
the good things
about dropping out.

18:14.310 --> 18:16.356
They can't really
expel me, right?

18:16.399 --> 18:18.445
Does this mean
we have records now?

18:20.490 --> 18:22.318
The disk just disappeared.

18:23.189 --> 18:24.451
How does that happen?

18:29.282 --> 18:30.587
We need to talk.

18:42.121 --> 18:43.644
Mom, I'm really sorry.

18:45.428 --> 18:48.301
Please say something.
Anything.

18:48.344 --> 18:49.954
Be mad.
I'll even take the yelling.

18:49.998 --> 18:52.174
I'm not gonna yell at you.

18:52.218 --> 18:55.264
I'm not mad,
I'm just disappointed.

18:56.570 --> 18:59.747
I know. I'm sorry
you had to come down here.

18:59.790 --> 19:01.009
I'm sorry that I did it.

19:01.052 --> 19:03.272
What I don't understand is
why you did it.

19:03.316 --> 19:07.537
Instead of working on the essay
that gets you into
your dream school,

19:07.581 --> 19:10.540
you go on a tour
of some other school...

19:10.584 --> 19:13.935
where you trespass
and destroy property?

19:13.978 --> 19:16.807
What were you even doing there?

19:16.851 --> 19:19.854
Of all the times
to start acting
like a delinquent, Naomi...

19:20.681 --> 19:22.073
A delinquent?

19:22.117 --> 19:24.337
Mom, I really am sorry,

19:24.380 --> 19:26.382
but you're treating me
like it's my third strike

19:26.426 --> 19:28.645
when I've never been
in trouble before, ever.

19:31.257 --> 19:33.868
You've just worked so hard
for Hartford.

19:33.911 --> 19:38.655
These last few days,
it seems like your head
has been somewhere else.

19:38.699 --> 19:41.484
Maybe you're just
growing up, changing.

19:41.528 --> 19:43.443
Would that be such a bad thing?

19:46.794 --> 19:47.795
That's your dad.

19:49.884 --> 19:53.061
I want you home
by 6:00 tonight, okay?

19:53.104 --> 19:54.932
Okay, see you at 6:00.

20:11.558 --> 20:13.560
Slow hands often mean
heavy head.

20:15.388 --> 20:16.650
What's on your mind?

20:18.739 --> 20:20.610
My mom and I
got in a fight today.

20:21.350 --> 20:22.569
Is that normal?

20:22.612 --> 20:25.615
No. I never fight
with my parents.

20:28.792 --> 20:30.403
I...

20:30.446 --> 20:32.927
I kind of blew up a geology lab
trying to analyze the disk.

20:34.320 --> 20:35.886
That is not wise, Naomi.

20:38.193 --> 20:40.195
I'm sorry.

20:40.239 --> 20:45.548
I really don't mean to
disrespect you or your advice
or your training, but...

20:45.592 --> 20:49.335
My one lead,
it just vanished into thin air.

20:54.340 --> 20:55.558
Do you know something about it?

20:57.256 --> 20:59.127
Dee?

20:59.170 --> 21:02.261
There is literally one else
who can help me with this.

21:03.784 --> 21:04.785
Please.

21:06.656 --> 21:09.355
I don't know anything
about the disk.

21:09.398 --> 21:12.575
But I know someone who might.

21:12.619 --> 21:14.011
His name is Adam Blake.

21:15.274 --> 21:17.058
We fought together
a long time ago.

21:17.972 --> 21:20.191
Is Adam an alien too?

21:20.235 --> 21:22.324
With abilities that may help.

21:36.382 --> 21:37.470
Adam.

21:40.124 --> 21:41.474
Darcovo!

21:42.039 --> 21:43.345
My man.

21:44.477 --> 21:47.784
"Dee" is short for "Darcovo"?

21:47.828 --> 21:51.614
Adam, you said you had
some information
about the disk.

21:51.658 --> 21:54.008
It's an ancient form
of encrypted communication.

21:54.051 --> 21:57.577
But they don't usually
disappear without a trace.

21:57.620 --> 22:00.014
Your hands, please, ma'am.

22:00.057 --> 22:01.494
Naomi, it's okay.

22:03.931 --> 22:06.716
Adam can read
energy signatures.

22:06.760 --> 22:09.893
Direct contact allows him
to tap in and trace it.

22:10.503 --> 22:12.156
You're for real?

22:12.200 --> 22:14.028
Everything's energy, man.

22:20.382 --> 22:21.992
You do have a connection.

22:22.036 --> 22:25.735
Its energy is matched to yours,
almost like you're it's key.

22:27.607 --> 22:29.391
That disk you had today...

22:30.392 --> 22:32.089
it wasn't real.

22:32.133 --> 22:35.702
Yes, it was.
I saw it, I held it,
I carried it all day.

22:36.572 --> 22:38.008
Different energy.

22:38.052 --> 22:40.402
What you had
is called a transmutation.

22:40.446 --> 22:43.231
An object
conjured from nothing.

22:43.274 --> 22:45.668
Whoever did this is dangerous.

22:45.712 --> 22:47.888
You believe it was a warning?

22:49.716 --> 22:52.675
You have power
I have never felt before.

22:52.719 --> 22:56.766
That makes you a threat
to a lot of people.

22:56.810 --> 23:00.379
Sorry to be the one
to tell you. You seem cool.

23:00.422 --> 23:04.034
Adam, If I'm connected
to the disk,
why can't I read it?

23:04.078 --> 23:06.994
I'm guessing
the language is only
one of the disk's secrets.

23:07.037 --> 23:09.779
But every language
can be translated.

23:11.390 --> 23:15.089
Here in Port Oswego,
early explorers were there.

23:15.132 --> 23:17.744
About a century ago,
they would have had
what you need.

23:17.787 --> 23:19.310
- Maybe it's still there.

23:19.354 --> 23:21.095
- Someone's coming.
- Get down.

23:33.324 --> 23:36.545
Sorry, Dee.
Looks like I haven't stayed
as well-hidden as I thought.

23:36.589 --> 23:38.591
Take care of the girl.
I'll be right behind you.

23:58.045 --> 23:59.046
What's wrong?

24:01.135 --> 24:03.790
We should have stayed
to make sure Adam was okay.

24:05.269 --> 24:06.140
Adam is a soldier.

24:07.837 --> 24:10.492
- He can take care of himself.
- So can I.

24:14.235 --> 24:17.194
You are not prepared
for that level of combat.

24:17.238 --> 24:20.676
You've seen what I can do.
I have powers.

24:22.504 --> 24:23.897
You had no control over it.

24:25.202 --> 24:27.204
And that's dangerous.

24:27.248 --> 24:28.771
Especially with the military.

24:29.729 --> 24:31.121
That was a special-ops team.

24:32.819 --> 24:34.951
No. If the military
was involved,

24:34.995 --> 24:36.649
my dad would have
said something.

24:39.565 --> 24:41.044
No disrespect,

24:41.088 --> 24:43.569
but maybe I'd be
more ready to use my powers

24:43.612 --> 24:45.658
if you actually
let me use them.

24:47.224 --> 24:48.487
I will.

24:49.444 --> 24:50.793
In time.

24:50.837 --> 24:54.318
You heard Adam.
I'm connected to the disk.

24:54.362 --> 24:55.885
I have to find out why.

24:57.496 --> 24:59.628
Even if that means
using my powers.

25:00.368 --> 25:01.500
Naomi.

25:02.588 --> 25:04.241
I understand your frustration,

25:05.242 --> 25:06.548
but you're not ready.

25:10.857 --> 25:14.643
<i>♪ Fortune favors the bold</i>

25:16.166 --> 25:19.692
<i>♪ Fortune favors the bold</i>

25:23.870 --> 25:25.132
Are you guys waiting for me?

25:27.526 --> 25:28.570
Have a seat.

25:36.360 --> 25:37.884
This sounds serious.

25:43.280 --> 25:44.673
Is everything okay?

25:45.631 --> 25:48.285
I told you to be home by 6:00.

25:49.243 --> 25:50.679
I know,

25:50.723 --> 25:52.681
I'm sorry,
but something came up.

25:52.725 --> 25:54.291
Didn't you get my text?

25:54.335 --> 25:56.293
You broke a promise
to your mother.

25:59.340 --> 26:00.733
Is this about the lab?

26:01.777 --> 26:05.215
This is about you
not listening.

26:05.259 --> 26:06.782
Where were you, Naomi?

26:10.264 --> 26:13.354
I was with Lourdes.
I asked her to help me
with my essay.

26:17.924 --> 26:20.100
Lourdes called about
an hour ago,

26:21.144 --> 26:22.276
looking for you.

26:25.105 --> 26:27.020
Why don't you
tell us the truth?

26:34.636 --> 26:36.682
Hand over your phone, then.

26:36.725 --> 26:39.598
- Go to your room.
- What?

26:39.641 --> 26:40.903
You heard your father.

26:40.947 --> 26:42.949
Wait, are you grounding me?

26:44.690 --> 26:46.387
You've never
grounded me before.

26:46.430 --> 26:48.389
You've never lied to us.

26:50.391 --> 26:55.135
My whole life, you've treated
me like I was an adult
and I've acted like one.

26:55.178 --> 26:57.877
Now because I slipped up
a couple of times
during college week--

26:57.920 --> 27:01.141
- It's not about college week.
- Then what is it about?

27:01.184 --> 27:04.361
You've never cared
who I was with
or how late I stayed out,

27:04.405 --> 27:06.755
and now all of a sudden
things have just changed.

27:06.799 --> 27:10.629
If you had any idea
what's going on
out there right now...

27:12.413 --> 27:13.936
What are you talking about?

27:16.504 --> 27:18.941
Dad, what's going on?

27:18.985 --> 27:22.902
The only thing you need to know
is that it's very dangerous
out there.

27:25.382 --> 27:26.688
Your phone.

27:46.708 --> 27:48.362
I thought
I'd made myself clear.

27:48.405 --> 27:51.713
I have no interest in joining
whatever it is you're doing.

28:01.201 --> 28:05.684
You know she's the only one
who can make it do that.

28:05.727 --> 28:10.950
Involving the girl
is putting into motion
something you can't control.

28:10.993 --> 28:12.386
How do you know
she'll help you?

28:12.429 --> 28:14.693
She doesn't have a choice.

28:14.736 --> 28:16.782
Whether she's ready or not,

28:16.825 --> 28:18.958
it's time to reunite them.

28:19.001 --> 28:20.742
You really think she's the key?

28:20.786 --> 28:22.265
You know she is.

28:23.832 --> 28:25.051
This...

28:26.269 --> 28:28.532
is how we take back
our planet.

28:28.576 --> 28:31.884
You talk about our planet
like it's something
you care about.

28:35.801 --> 28:37.846
You and I were allies once.

28:38.629 --> 28:40.066
We could be again.

28:40.109 --> 28:43.504
I will never trust you again.

28:48.335 --> 28:49.336
Fine.

28:50.772 --> 28:51.817
Then trust in the girl.

28:51.860 --> 28:54.515
She's just a pawn to you.

28:55.385 --> 28:57.170
Join me or don't,

28:57.213 --> 28:58.867
but this is bigger than her.

28:58.911 --> 29:01.391
It's bigger than any of us.

29:01.435 --> 29:03.393
If you won't help me,

29:03.437 --> 29:05.613
I will make sure
you cannot stop me.

29:05.656 --> 29:07.833
I'm certain you'll try.

29:27.548 --> 29:28.941
Do you ever miss it?

29:30.594 --> 29:31.682
Home.

29:31.726 --> 29:33.032
It doesn't matter.

29:33.989 --> 29:35.774
I can't ever go back.

29:36.949 --> 29:38.472
You made sure of that.

29:57.883 --> 30:00.407
This looks
way easier in movies.

30:00.450 --> 30:01.669
What are you doing here?

30:01.712 --> 30:04.280
I brought you some <i>
Zatanna</i> comics.

30:04.324 --> 30:06.848
<i>Zatanna</i> is dope. But why?

30:09.068 --> 30:12.419
The way that disk vanished
reminded me of a run
a few years back.

30:12.462 --> 30:16.031
Zatanna needs to keep
a special artifact
away from bad guys.

30:16.075 --> 30:18.468
So she creates a huge fire
to destroy it,

30:18.512 --> 30:21.036
only to reveal it was
just hidden the whole time.

30:24.126 --> 30:28.130
But really,
I just came over to say sorry
I blew your cover story.

30:28.174 --> 30:31.177
It's not your fault.
I forgot to call you.

30:31.220 --> 30:33.832
Not that I can call
anyone anymore.

30:33.875 --> 30:35.007
They took your phone?

30:35.790 --> 30:37.183
Ouch!

30:37.226 --> 30:38.967
At least you have your laptop.

30:39.011 --> 30:41.013
Only for my admissions essay.

30:41.056 --> 30:43.493
Which I can't seem to
figure out a topic for.

30:46.148 --> 30:49.543
You just need to find something
with a surprising angle.

30:49.586 --> 30:50.805
Like this one.

30:50.849 --> 30:52.546
Is it always best
to tell the truth?

30:52.589 --> 30:54.678
"Yes" is easy.

30:54.722 --> 30:57.420
"No" is interesting.

30:57.464 --> 31:00.032
"No" is also
what gets you grounded.

31:02.773 --> 31:06.516
I've always had this, like,
really clear idea of who I was,

31:06.560 --> 31:09.128
knew who I was meant to be.
But lately...

31:09.171 --> 31:11.304
I just feel like
everything is changing.

31:11.347 --> 31:13.610
Welcome to life.
Change happens.

31:15.351 --> 31:17.919
Like when my dad got hurt.

31:17.963 --> 31:22.489
One random accident
on a tour overseas,
and now I'm...

31:24.752 --> 31:26.058
a high-school dropout.

31:28.060 --> 31:30.671
I don't even really
miss school anymore.

31:31.759 --> 31:32.673
Really?

31:33.804 --> 31:34.893
Really.

31:36.982 --> 31:39.114
I see the people I like.

31:44.728 --> 31:49.255
<i>In the comic,</i> <i>
Zatanna's fire</i> <i>
concealed her artifact.</i>

31:49.298 --> 31:55.261
<i>In 1921, the Port Oswego fire</i> <i>
happened above</i> <i>
the underground bomb shelter.</i>

31:55.304 --> 31:58.003
<i>Maybe that's where
the translation key is hidden.</i>

32:36.041 --> 32:38.173
- Psst! Hey!
- Annabelle?

32:38.217 --> 32:39.958
You weren't answering
your phone,

32:40.001 --> 32:42.569
so I assumed
the zombie apocalypse
was finally upon us.

32:42.612 --> 32:44.005
Guessing you're grounded?

32:44.049 --> 32:45.572
Aren't you grounded?

32:45.615 --> 32:47.226
It's a conversation.

32:48.444 --> 32:50.881
Are we running away from home?

32:50.925 --> 32:53.493
I'm going to the underground
bomb shelter in the square.

32:53.536 --> 32:55.016
- Weird choice
for a hideout...
- Shh!

32:55.060 --> 32:56.583
...but okay.

32:56.626 --> 32:58.759
Obviously I'm coming with you.
I'm your ride or ride.

32:58.802 --> 33:00.152
You mean "ride or die."

33:00.195 --> 33:02.241
I don't want that kind of
negativity in my life.

33:08.856 --> 33:11.815
So, you met another alien,
the disk was fake,

33:11.859 --> 33:14.470
your powers make you a target,
the military's hunting aliens,

33:14.514 --> 33:16.255
and both parents
are mad at you.

33:16.864 --> 33:19.345
Yep, pretty much.

33:19.388 --> 33:21.825
Okay. And now you think that
there is an alien Rosetta Stone

33:21.869 --> 33:26.700
hidden somewhere
underneath this building
because... <i>Space Explorers.</i>

33:26.743 --> 33:28.180
That's what I said.

33:28.223 --> 33:30.269
There were early sightings
in the 1930s,

33:30.312 --> 33:34.012
but I never connected
the Port Oswego fire to
the underground bomb shelter

33:34.055 --> 33:35.839
until Lourdes visited.

33:35.883 --> 33:38.842
- Lourdes? We're definitely
gonna unpack that later.
- Okay, okay.

33:43.630 --> 33:46.720
Good evening, sir.
We need to see
those tunnels.

33:46.763 --> 33:49.505
- You're probably wondering
why we're here so late--
- Go ahead.

33:49.549 --> 33:53.422
Just don't graffiti
anything down there, okay?

34:03.606 --> 34:06.044
What exactly
are we looking for?

34:06.914 --> 34:09.525
I'm not totally sure.

34:09.569 --> 34:12.137
But if it's anything like
the real Rosetta Stone,

34:12.180 --> 34:15.183
it'll have the same markings
as the disk.

34:15.227 --> 34:20.406
Is it weird that I now just
assume Zumbado will show up
in scary situations like this?

34:26.412 --> 34:28.066
We should...
We should hurry.

34:39.773 --> 34:41.470
I see something.

34:41.514 --> 34:43.298
I think it's
the translation key.

34:43.342 --> 34:44.734
It's way back there.

34:47.781 --> 34:48.782
Annabelle?

34:52.177 --> 34:55.876
It definitely looks like
something from <i>Space Explorers.</i>

34:55.919 --> 35:00.098
These rocks
are too heavy. It's lodged.
I can't grab it.

35:00.141 --> 35:04.711
Stand back.
I'm gonna create a path
so we can get to it.

35:04.754 --> 35:08.106
You know I'm pro powers,
but this place doesn't exactly
seem stable.

35:09.107 --> 35:10.412
I can control it.

35:27.386 --> 35:30.171
Naomi!
I got this.

35:41.574 --> 35:43.315
Um, babe?

35:45.230 --> 35:46.448
You did it!

35:49.756 --> 35:52.802
- Naomi, we need to go.
- I have to know
what the disk says.

35:55.718 --> 35:57.024
Naomi, come on!

35:57.067 --> 36:00.158
- I've almost got it.
- Naomi, we need to go now!

36:00.810 --> 36:02.160
Naomi!

36:02.203 --> 36:03.813
Come on, come on!

36:14.868 --> 36:15.869
Naomi.

36:17.044 --> 36:20.090
You're very... dusty.

36:20.134 --> 36:21.962
Please don't be mad,

36:22.005 --> 36:25.095
but I went to look for
the translation key
Adam told us about.

36:25.139 --> 36:27.576
I appreciate your honesty.

36:27.620 --> 36:29.012
Did you find
what you're looking for?

36:29.056 --> 36:30.231
Yeah.

36:31.232 --> 36:32.842
And then I lost it.

36:32.886 --> 36:36.803
And I almost killed Annabelle
and myself in the process.

36:36.846 --> 36:39.632
I thought I could control it,
but you were right.

36:39.675 --> 36:41.851
Well, thank you
for saying that.

36:44.245 --> 36:46.073
But it's not about
right or wrong.

36:46.116 --> 36:51.339
The ups and downs,
the imbalance you feel,
it's normal.

36:51.383 --> 36:56.126
That's why they're called
"growing pains"
not "growing joys."

36:56.170 --> 36:57.911
That could really use
a rebrand.

36:59.086 --> 37:00.392
It would probably help.

37:02.698 --> 37:05.614
I was able to translate
the markings on the disk.

37:06.702 --> 37:09.662
It says "The Twenty-Nine."

37:52.879 --> 37:55.273

38:17.077 --> 38:20.733

38:27.000 --> 38:28.654

38:30.351 --> 38:31.961

39:04.254 --> 39:05.865
<i>But change is not a choice.</i>

39:13.960 --> 39:14.961
Yeah.

39:18.051 --> 39:19.052
Um...

39:21.750 --> 39:25.014
You are the most
important part of my life.

39:25.058 --> 39:30.150
And last night, I realized
that, more than anything,
I need you.

39:30.193 --> 39:32.979
I don't want to fight anymore.
I just want to be honest.

39:33.022 --> 39:35.024
So there's something
I need to tell you.

39:39.551 --> 39:41.509
We have something
to tell you, too.

39:47.820 --> 39:51.389
The military discovered
that there are aliens
living here on Earth.

39:52.564 --> 39:54.522
They believe them to be
a threat.

39:54.566 --> 39:55.828
They're hunting them.

39:57.569 --> 39:58.961
They're hunting them?

40:00.093 --> 40:02.095
That's what
I haven't been telling you.

40:04.184 --> 40:06.969
But that's not why
we're driving out here.

40:07.013 --> 40:09.015
Then why are we
driving out here?

40:11.583 --> 40:13.149
It's better if you just see it.

40:16.152 --> 40:17.676
<i>Change is hard.</i>

40:17.719 --> 40:19.721
<i>But if you can accept</i> <i>
that it's inevitable,</i>

40:19.765 --> 40:21.506
<i>you'll be okay moving forward.</i>

40:22.768 --> 40:24.509
<i>No matter what happens next.</i>

40:27.860 --> 40:30.950
Are you guys bringing me
out here to kill me?

40:30.993 --> 40:33.605
We changed your diapers
and kept you alive for 16 years

40:33.648 --> 40:35.433
so we could murder you
in a forest?

40:35.476 --> 40:38.044
You're the one
who made me watch
all those horror movies.

40:39.480 --> 40:41.569
We're here.

40:41.613 --> 40:43.876
Okay. You're really
freaking me out now.

40:52.362 --> 40:54.408
What is this?

40:54.452 --> 40:55.975
This is where we found you.
