-[photographer]
Smile, beautiful, very nice.

00:10.218 --> 00:12.178
And let's bring Kristi in
a little closer.

00:12.220 --> 00:13.930
Okay. Kristi, right here,
sweetheart

00:13.972 --> 00:17.225
looking in the camera.
And smiling... very nice.

00:17.851 --> 00:20.145
-Don’t they look beautiful?

00:20.186 --> 00:22.313
-Yeah. No one would ever
know that we are

00:22.355 --> 00:24.315
at the worst photographer’s
studio in Brooklyn.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.194
Ok. good.

00:28.236 --> 00:30.280
Looks like we have
some alternatives to offer.

00:30.321 --> 00:31.865
-You headed back to the office?

00:31.906 --> 00:34.200
-Yep. I have my pitch session
with Helen.

00:34.242 --> 00:35.910
It has taken me six months

00:35.952 --> 00:38.288
to get her to let me out of
assistant prison

00:38.329 --> 00:39.956
and consider me
as a feature writer.

00:39.998 --> 00:41.166
-You’ve got this.

00:41.207 --> 00:42.667
You were the editor
of your campus paper.

00:42.709 --> 00:44.878
You won the Colberry Award.
You’ve got all the skills.

00:44.919 --> 00:46.588
-Yeah, I feel good about it.

00:47.797 --> 00:49.674
These wedding shoots
are exhausting.

00:49.716 --> 00:51.092
Like actual weddings.

00:51.134 --> 00:52.761
-Ooop!
-Oh. Hey.

00:52.802 --> 00:54.137
-Oh, my goodness.
Can I help you?

00:54.763 --> 01:01.603
*

01:01.644 --> 01:05.482
-Careful. Oh, there's a...
there's a string...

01:11.529 --> 01:12.739
[phone ringing]

01:12.781 --> 01:13.782
One of the brides?

01:13.823 --> 01:16.076
-Yep, bride number two.
Michelle.

01:16.117 --> 01:18.578
Lawyer, very detail-oriented.

01:18.620 --> 01:19.621
Sorry, can I?

01:19.662 --> 01:21.081
-Ok.

01:21.122 --> 01:23.249
-Hey, Michelle.

01:23.291 --> 01:27.504
Yes, I think pink peonies are a
perfect substitute for dahlias.

01:28.630 --> 01:29.839
Mmhm.

01:30.799 --> 01:32.217
Sure. No problem.

01:32.258 --> 01:33.718
I just stepped inside
the elevator though

01:33.760 --> 01:35.136
so this call may drop.

01:35.804 --> 01:36.805
[elevator dings]

01:38.473 --> 01:39.599
-Yeah.

01:39.641 --> 01:41.226
Sure, no problem.

01:41.267 --> 01:42.811
Ok, I’ve gotta go Michelle.

01:44.312 --> 01:46.648
No, lime isn’t a disgusting
color at all.

01:48.024 --> 01:49.401
Yeah, it’ll be fine.

01:49.442 --> 01:52.362
Ok, I’ve gotta go.
Great, I’ll see you tonight.

01:52.404 --> 01:53.363
Love you.

01:53.947 --> 01:55.365
[exhales]

01:57.409 --> 01:59.119
-You gotta get in there, Trish.

01:59.160 --> 02:00.286
If you’re late it’s gonna
take six months

02:00.328 --> 02:01.663
to get another meeting.

02:02.706 --> 02:03.665
-[exhales]
Ok.

02:05.542 --> 02:06.793
Here I go.

02:07.335 --> 02:10.046
-Do it yourself spa treatment?
No.

02:10.088 --> 02:12.882
Candle making as a voyage
of self-discovery. No.

02:12.924 --> 02:15.719
Colonics as a component
of your meditation practice.

02:15.760 --> 02:17.303
Hard no.

02:17.345 --> 02:19.305
-I have other...
Uh, what about...

02:19.347 --> 02:21.683
-Please, stop,
before you kill again.

02:21.725 --> 02:23.977
All of these are variations
on articles we’ve done

02:24.019 --> 02:25.437
over the past few months, Trish.

02:25.478 --> 02:27.313
I haven’t just heard
these ideas before,

02:27.355 --> 02:28.982
I’ve actually published
them already.

02:29.024 --> 02:30.400
-I was trying to stay on brand.

02:30.442 --> 02:32.110
-Listen, if you want to move

02:32.152 --> 02:34.696
from executive assistant
to feature writer-

02:34.738 --> 02:36.322
-And I desperately do.

02:36.364 --> 02:38.491
Becoming a writer has been
my soul focus for years so I...

02:38.533 --> 02:41.327
-And write big stories,
personal stories,

02:41.369 --> 02:43.997
then why are you pitched me
yesterday’s material?

02:44.039 --> 02:47.417
Aren’t you leaving in a few
hours for three weeks off?

02:47.459 --> 02:49.085
-Yes, but that doesn’t mean

02:49.127 --> 02:51.046
that I can’t blue sky
some new ideas for you.

02:51.087 --> 02:53.590
-And you’re going to a wedding,
is that right?

02:53.631 --> 02:57.344
-Three weddings actually
over three consecutive weekends.

02:57.385 --> 02:59.804
All of my best friends form
high school are getting married

02:59.846 --> 03:03.183
in the same month and I am
a bridesmaid at each of them.

03:03.224 --> 03:04.851
If you can believe that.

03:04.893 --> 03:05.894
[chuckles nervously]

03:07.228 --> 03:10.523
[awkward music]

03:11.441 --> 03:15.403
Uh... You did approve the time
off and Dani can fill in

03:15.445 --> 03:17.489
but I am just a phone call away
if you need any...

03:17.530 --> 03:18.490
-This is it.

03:20.241 --> 03:25.288
-What? No, no,
um, I... I love my job,

03:25.330 --> 03:27.040
I can call my friends
if you would just...

03:27.082 --> 03:29.751
-Trish, I’m not firing you.
I’m telling you this is it.

03:29.793 --> 03:31.002
This is your piece.

03:31.836 --> 03:33.088
-It is?

03:33.129 --> 03:35.548
-Absolutely!
Three friends, three weddings.

03:35.590 --> 03:38.385
The changes in their lives.
Opening up a new chapter.

03:38.426 --> 03:41.763
All seen through the person
closest to them.

03:41.805 --> 03:44.391
Weddings are evergreen pieces
for us .

03:44.432 --> 03:46.267
The piece will be a little

03:46.309 --> 03:47.894
“always a bridesmaid,
never a bride.”

03:49.688 --> 03:51.272
-[Dani] You don't even
like weddings.

03:51.314 --> 03:53.942
-[Trish] Not a fan of the
wedding industrial complex.

03:53.983 --> 03:56.820
-This is like sending Scrooge in
to review It’s a Wonderful Life

03:56.861 --> 03:58.947
-Thank you.

03:58.988 --> 04:00.198
-But how’s this any different

04:00.240 --> 04:01.991
than anything else
that we publish?

04:02.033 --> 04:04.661
It’s not like you’re
particularly into spa treatments

04:04.703 --> 04:06.746
but you’re willing to write
about those.

04:06.788 --> 04:09.082
-I don’t know.
It’s just different.

04:09.124 --> 04:10.750
-That’s an excellent answer

04:10.792 --> 04:13.878
for someone who wants to be
an investigative journalist.

04:13.920 --> 04:16.631
Who’s gonna be your date
for all these weddings anyway?

04:16.673 --> 04:20.677
-Ok, I am a strong, independent,
21st century woman.

04:20.719 --> 04:22.012
I do not need a date

04:22.053 --> 04:23.596
just because I happen
to be going to a wedding.

04:23.638 --> 04:24.973
-Three weddings.

04:25.015 --> 04:28.268
And I predict that you will not
have a minute to write

04:28.309 --> 04:29.352
because you’ll spend
all your time

04:29.394 --> 04:30.603
fending off setups.

04:30.645 --> 04:32.105
There’s something
about weddings

04:32.147 --> 04:34.858
that make people crazy
to couple everybody up.

04:34.899 --> 04:37.235
It’s like they put something
in the red velvet cake.

04:37.277 --> 04:38.695
-Great, can’t wait.

04:38.737 --> 04:40.321
-Mmhm.

04:40.363 --> 04:42.907
-Alright, wish me luck.
I’ll call you when I get there.

04:45.035 --> 04:46.619
-This is not gonna end pretty.

04:46.661 --> 04:48.663
[cheerful music]

04:51.666 --> 05:04.721
*

05:09.017 --> 05:10.185
-Peterson?

05:10.226 --> 05:14.189
-Paterson! There you are!
[laughing]

05:14.230 --> 05:15.607
Finally!

05:16.232 --> 05:17.442
-Put me down, Peterson.

05:17.484 --> 05:19.486
I am a respected
magazine journalist.

05:19.527 --> 05:20.904
-Not here you’re not.

05:20.945 --> 05:22.655
Here you’re still the same
Trish Paterson

05:22.697 --> 05:25.408
who set the Hillside record
for most consecutive days

05:25.450 --> 05:27.619
off after school detention
for talking back to teachers.

05:27.660 --> 05:31.331
-Ok, that was totally unjust and
I said so in the school paper.

05:31.373 --> 05:33.333
-Mm. Which led to,
what was it again?

05:33.375 --> 05:34.626
Oh yes, more detentions.

05:34.668 --> 05:36.670
-Ok, ok, maybe not
the best strategy

05:36.711 --> 05:39.422
but I did feel like I had
justice on my side.

05:39.464 --> 05:41.758
-Well, you’re never in detention
here. Come on.

05:42.008 --> 05:44.344
You're writing your first
feature about our weddings,

05:44.386 --> 05:46.054
Trish, that’s amazing.

05:46.096 --> 05:47.055
You’ve been working
for this for..

05:47.097 --> 05:49.307
-Years. Literally. Yes.

05:49.349 --> 05:50.475
-Hey.

05:53.687 --> 05:55.814
You’re gonna have to get
everyone to agree.

05:55.855 --> 05:57.232
That's not gonna be
a problem with...

05:57.273 --> 05:58.441
-June and Peter.

05:58.483 --> 05:59.776
-June and Peter.
Right, they'll love it.

05:59.818 --> 06:01.903
And of course Laurel and I
will always support you.

06:01.945 --> 06:02.904
-Oh, thanks.

06:02.946 --> 06:04.072
You guys are always there
for me.

06:04.114 --> 06:05.031
-But that does leave..

06:05.073 --> 06:06.032
-Michelle.

06:06.074 --> 06:06.783
-Michelle.

06:06.825 --> 06:07.992
-Yeah.

06:08.034 --> 06:10.704
-I mean, Rod’s gonna do
whatever she says.

06:10.745 --> 06:13.081
But she’s gonna see
all the downsides.

06:13.123 --> 06:15.542
-I know. And that’s why I need
you to help me with her.

06:15.583 --> 06:17.419
-Ok, so I love you,
you’re my best friend

06:17.460 --> 06:19.337
but you’re on your own there.

06:19.379 --> 06:22.507
Particularly since
I’m not gonna be around.

06:22.549 --> 06:23.883
-What do you mean "not around"?

06:23.925 --> 06:26.011
-One last business trip
out west before the wedding.

06:26.052 --> 06:27.554
Hey, believe me,
not my choice,

06:27.595 --> 06:29.597
but the boss is giving me
a whole month off-

06:29.639 --> 06:31.766
-Hold on, hold on, hold on.

06:32.308 --> 06:33.810
That means that I’m gonna be
on my own

06:33.852 --> 06:35.395
as I go through all this
wedding stuff?

06:35.437 --> 06:36.730
You can’t do that to me,
Peterson.

06:36.771 --> 06:40.233
-Ok, I thought of that
and I have a solution.

06:40.275 --> 06:41.443
My brother Ryan’s
coming to town,

06:41.484 --> 06:43.028
he’ll be the perfect wingman
for you.

06:43.069 --> 06:45.238
-I don’t need a wingman.
I just went through this.

06:45.280 --> 06:47.866
I don’t need a date just
because I’m going to a wedding.

06:47.907 --> 06:49.409
-Hey, three weddings.

06:49.451 --> 06:51.745
Come on, you’d be doing me
a favor.

06:51.786 --> 06:53.288
He’s kind of at loose end.

06:53.329 --> 06:56.249
-Well I never really knew him.
I mean, he was gone pretty much

06:56.291 --> 06:58.585
by the time we started
hanging out.

06:58.626 --> 07:01.254
What part of the world is
he flying in from this time?

07:01.296 --> 07:05.258
-Uh, Mozambique?
Mauritania, Morocco.

07:05.300 --> 07:08.136
I can’t keep track anymore.

07:08.178 --> 07:12.557
-Wait, so, how does Laurel feel
about you taking off like this?

07:12.599 --> 07:13.767
-Oh, she understands.

07:13.808 --> 07:15.018
-Uh huh.

07:15.060 --> 07:17.771
Well, thanks again
for letting me stay here.

07:17.812 --> 07:18.772
-Of course.

07:18.813 --> 07:19.606
-Hey, when do your parents
get in?

07:19.647 --> 07:20.774
I’m excited to see them.

07:20.815 --> 07:22.275
-I actually heard from Mom
this morning

07:22.317 --> 07:24.861
and unfortunately
Dad’s stuck on the base

07:24.903 --> 07:26.571
so it looks like they
won't be able to make it

07:26.613 --> 07:28.239
till the day before the wedding.

07:28.281 --> 07:34.120
Which means that it’s going to
be just you and Ryan till then,

07:34.162 --> 07:36.456
-That is totally fine.

07:36.498 --> 07:38.958
The beauty of this place
will make up for the massive ego

07:39.000 --> 07:39.959
I’ll be dealing with.

07:40.001 --> 07:41.461
[chuckles)

07:41.503 --> 07:42.629
Come on, let’s get you settled
in the guest house

07:42.671 --> 07:44.130
then hustle over
to the party, huh?

07:44.172 --> 07:45.048
-Alright.

07:45.090 --> 07:45.965
-Yes!

07:46.299 --> 07:55.767

07:59.813 --> 08:00.772
[car beeps]

08:07.278 --> 08:11.199
-[party music]
-[overlapping chatter]

08:11.241 --> 08:12.617
-Hi!

08:12.659 --> 08:15.787
Sorry, I’m sorry.
Blame this guy.

08:16.788 --> 08:18.456
Stopped by to change
my work clothes

08:18.498 --> 08:20.417
and suddenly were having
an epic catch up.

08:20.458 --> 08:22.002
-Sure, sure,
just like that time

08:22.043 --> 08:23.712
we got caught climbing
on the roof of the gym.

08:23.753 --> 08:25.922
Now all of a sudden
it's my idea, right Paterson?

08:25.964 --> 08:28.341
-Because it was totally
your idea, Peterson.

08:28.383 --> 08:31.678
-Honestly, is it too much to ask
you two to refer to each other

08:31.720 --> 08:33.722
by your first names
just for this event?

08:33.763 --> 08:35.265
-I don't know, it’s pretty
deeply ingrained at this point.

08:35.306 --> 08:37.559
-Yeah, I think we've been
calling each other that since...

08:37.600 --> 08:38.977
-Mrs. Donahue’s class?
-Freshman year.

08:39.019 --> 08:40.228
-Yeah.

08:40.270 --> 08:41.354
-This girl with the bright
pink neon backpack

08:41.396 --> 08:42.522
sits down next to me.

08:42.564 --> 08:44.190
-This goofy guy
with a bowl cut says

08:44.232 --> 08:45.900
“hello Paterson, I’m Peterson.”

08:45.942 --> 08:47.694
-Pretty much inseparable
after that.

08:47.736 --> 08:50.155
-Trisha Paterson!
It’s about time.

08:50.196 --> 08:51.489
-Oh, it’s so good to see you.

08:51.531 --> 08:53.033
-Hi!
-Hey, Trish.

08:53.074 --> 08:55.493
-Oh, leaning into that rock
and roll fairy tale theme I see.

08:55.535 --> 08:56.828
-Yup.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.371
-I know. We’ve raided
every vintage shops

08:58.413 --> 09:00.331
all the way from here to Boston
just to find these jackets.

09:00.373 --> 09:03.585
Oh, and I have a long list of
thrift stores I want to hit.

09:03.626 --> 09:05.003
Will you be my wing-woman?

09:05.045 --> 09:06.087
-Of course.

09:06.129 --> 09:07.547
-That is just the beginning

09:07.589 --> 09:09.716
because there are wine tastings,
bridesmaid fitting,

09:09.758 --> 09:12.302
reception rehearsals and then
the weddings themselves.

09:12.344 --> 09:13.928
You are going to be busy.

09:13.970 --> 09:15.555
-I can’t wait.

09:15.597 --> 09:19.434
-Oh, um, heads up, I think we’re
all about to be cross-examined.

09:19.476 --> 09:20.393
-Michelle.

09:20.435 --> 09:22.062
-There you are.

09:22.103 --> 09:24.230
Hey, girl, listen, I’ve been
working on a seating chart

09:24.272 --> 09:25.607
and I wanted to make sure

09:25.648 --> 09:27.108
that you didn’t have some
imaginary boyfriend

09:27.150 --> 09:28.818
that isn’t gonna show up
at the last minute.

09:28.860 --> 09:30.612
Now, if you don’t have anyone
I could pair you

09:30.653 --> 09:32.655
with one of the interns
from Rod’s hospital.

09:32.697 --> 09:34.532
-Future wife here always has
a contingency plan.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.493
-'Cause I know how embarrassing
it can be

09:36.534 --> 09:38.286
where the only one seated
on your own

09:38.328 --> 09:39.954
when everyone else
has a partner.

09:39.996 --> 09:42.457
-Uh, why don’t we cut Trish
some slack, Michelle?

09:42.499 --> 09:44.751
She’s overwhelmed
with bridesmaid duties.

09:45.627 --> 09:47.962
-Did my sensitivity chip
go offline?

09:48.004 --> 09:49.589
-Uh, a little bit.

09:49.631 --> 09:52.801
-I am sorry. I totally get it.

09:52.842 --> 09:56.012
I mean, Rod barely got his
shift covered for this party,

09:56.054 --> 09:57.389
so no pressure.

09:57.430 --> 09:59.808
It’s just a logistics thing, ok?

09:59.849 --> 10:02.644
-Thanks for understanding.
How’s work for you?

10:02.686 --> 10:04.396
-Insane. It’s insane.

10:04.437 --> 10:05.480
They have me on
the partner track

10:05.522 --> 10:08.608
and the hours are brutal
but I love it.

10:08.650 --> 10:10.026
What are you working on?

10:11.528 --> 10:16.199
-Well, why don’t we take a seat,
we’ll get a drink.

10:16.241 --> 10:17.325
Go sit down.

10:17.367 --> 10:18.785
-[Laurel] Ok.
-[Sean] Let’s go.

10:20.286 --> 10:22.288
-You know, I saw all of my
carefully constructed ideas

10:22.330 --> 10:24.290
go down in flames.

10:24.332 --> 10:28.336
But then, my editor suggested
I was missing something

10:28.378 --> 10:30.255
that was right in front of me.

10:31.631 --> 10:33.216
All of you.

10:33.258 --> 10:34.050
-Wait, what does that mean?

10:34.092 --> 10:35.635
-Us?

10:35.677 --> 10:38.138
-Well, she mentioned that this
is a pretty unique situation,

10:38.179 --> 10:40.432
you know, three weddings
all in three weeks.

10:40.473 --> 10:45.311
And that it had huge potential
for a feature article.

10:45.353 --> 10:47.313
It would be my first
major piece.

10:47.355 --> 10:49.232
-Oh! That is so exciting!

10:49.274 --> 10:50.316
-Yes!

10:50.358 --> 10:51.693
-No.

10:53.695 --> 10:55.447
-Uh, why not, Michelle?

10:55.488 --> 10:57.824
-Well, for one thing, what’s
this story actually about?

10:57.866 --> 10:59.409
-Well, it would be about,
you know,

10:59.451 --> 11:01.536
how friends have managed
to stay close

11:01.578 --> 11:03.246
since high school and...

11:03.288 --> 11:04.664
-Which is all because of you,

11:04.706 --> 11:07.000
because you’re the glue
that keeps us all together.

11:07.042 --> 11:09.002
-You guys remember the night
of the graduation bonfire

11:09.044 --> 11:11.004
when she made us
all sign an oath

11:11.046 --> 11:13.173
to come back to the same place
every summer.

11:13.214 --> 11:16.134
-Ok, you’re all just lucky
that we didn’t go to June’s idea

11:16.176 --> 11:18.219
of poking our fingers
and signing in blood.

11:18.261 --> 11:20.388
-I am just saying that if you’re
going to sign a pact

11:20.430 --> 11:22.223
then you should sign a pact.

11:22.265 --> 11:23.933
-You know what I’m talking
about, Trish.

11:23.975 --> 11:26.227
Is this article gonna make us
all look ridiculous?

11:26.269 --> 11:27.437
-No, of course not.

11:27.479 --> 11:29.564
I would never do that
to any of you.

11:29.606 --> 11:32.192
This is supposed to be
a positive piece

11:32.233 --> 11:36.780
about the, you know, best day
of your life... or lives.

11:36.821 --> 11:39.616
-Why did they assign
this article to you?

11:39.657 --> 11:41.910
-Well, because I know
you all so well.

11:41.951 --> 11:43.661
-No, I mean, why did they think

11:43.703 --> 11:45.497
that you could write well
about weddings?

11:45.538 --> 11:47.791
You’re allergic
to the subject.

11:47.832 --> 11:50.669
-I just think that
they can be...

11:50.710 --> 11:53.296
a little too commercial
sometimes.

11:53.338 --> 11:55.256
-It is a little odd, is all.

11:55.298 --> 11:57.550
-Remember when you said
that marriage was the only time

11:57.592 --> 12:00.220
you needed a license
to go to prison?

12:00.261 --> 12:01.137
-Did I say that?
-Yeah.

12:01.179 --> 12:01.930
-Okay.

12:01.971 --> 12:03.348
-What would we have to do?

12:03.390 --> 12:04.557
-Nothing much.

12:04.599 --> 12:06.851
Really, I would just be
taking notes

12:06.893 --> 12:08.728
and writing about our group.

12:08.770 --> 12:10.313
Yeah, maybe
an interview or two,

12:10.355 --> 12:12.607
but you wouldn’t really have
to do anything.

12:12.649 --> 12:14.401
And this absolutely
will not interfere

12:14.442 --> 12:17.862
with my bridesmaid duties,
I can promise you that.

12:17.904 --> 12:20.907
-Ok, come on Michelle.
Like, what do you have to lose?

12:20.949 --> 12:23.284
-I guess you can’t do it
without Rod and I.

12:23.326 --> 12:24.744
-Not really.

12:24.786 --> 12:26.955
I mean, it's sort of the concept
behind the whole thing.

12:26.996 --> 12:28.707
Three couples, three weddings.

12:28.748 --> 12:29.958
-Come on, Michelle.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.836
-Michelle, come on!
Ok, we can be famous!

12:32.877 --> 12:35.088
-We need you!
-Alright. Alright.

12:35.130 --> 12:36.172
-Yes!

12:37.757 --> 12:39.175
-You have to paint us
in a good light, promise?

12:39.217 --> 12:39.843
-I promise.

12:39.884 --> 12:41.636
-The deal is done!

12:41.678 --> 12:44.764
-Thank you, guys.
This means a lot.

12:44.806 --> 12:46.599
-Ok, you know what,
enough of this.

12:46.641 --> 12:48.685
I think it is time to dance.

12:48.727 --> 12:51.271
-Let's go.
-Us too. Watch your step

12:51.312 --> 12:53.898
*

12:53.940 --> 12:56.651
* Been waiting
for a girl like you *

12:56.693 --> 12:59.612
* To be my sunrise *

12:59.654 --> 13:02.323
* Been waiting
for a girl like you *

13:02.365 --> 13:05.118
* To light up my night *

13:05.160 --> 13:07.871
* Been waiting
for a girl like you *

13:07.912 --> 13:10.874
* With fire in her eyes *

13:10.915 --> 13:13.460
* Been waiting
for a girl like you *

13:13.501 --> 13:16.087
* To light up my life *

13:16.129 --> 13:22.010
* I've been waiting for a
lifetime for somebody so true *

13:22.052 --> 13:24.137
-* I thought that I
was finished *

13:24.179 --> 13:27.015
* now I'm starting new. *

13:27.515 --> 13:30.143
How exciting it was to see
all of my friends together

13:30.185 --> 13:34.230
on the dance floor, poised
on the cliff of marriage.

13:36.399 --> 13:37.650
No, that's not right.

13:37.692 --> 13:41.237
Precipices? Overhang?

13:41.279 --> 13:42.364
Sheer drop?

13:45.700 --> 13:48.203
Hi, a glass
of pinot noir, please?

13:49.704 --> 13:52.123
-[whispering] Trish. Trish.

13:55.543 --> 13:56.670
-Hey, Peter.
-Hey.

13:56.711 --> 13:57.754
-What’s up?

13:57.796 --> 13:59.047
-Take this.

14:00.965 --> 14:04.094
-"I Love You Alone"
by Sheryl Townsend?

14:04.135 --> 14:06.721
-Yeah, it’s the song
June and I first danced to

14:06.763 --> 14:08.640
at the spring dance
our freshman year.

14:09.891 --> 14:11.643
Don’t you remember?

14:11.685 --> 14:13.603
-To be honest, no.

14:14.396 --> 14:16.398
-Then June went
and bought me the record.

14:16.439 --> 14:18.983
This classic vintage record.

14:19.025 --> 14:21.152
So, I want it to be a surprise

14:21.194 --> 14:23.613
for our first dance
at the reception.

14:23.655 --> 14:26.574
Could you hold onto it for me
like you’re the ring bearer?

14:26.616 --> 14:28.993
Yeah, I want to be sure
it’s a real surprise for June

14:29.035 --> 14:30.578
when the needle drops.

14:31.454 --> 14:33.540
-Sure. No problem.

14:33.581 --> 14:34.916
-Great! Yes.

14:34.958 --> 14:36.334
Ok, um, I better get back

14:36.376 --> 14:39.462
before June wonders
why I’ve disappeared.

14:39.504 --> 14:40.547
-Thank you!

14:40.588 --> 14:41.506
-Ok.

14:42.424 --> 14:49.389
*

14:49.431 --> 14:52.559
-Trish! So happy!

14:52.600 --> 14:53.852
-Hi, Carrie.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.895
-I was desperate for someone
fun to talk to.

14:55.937 --> 14:57.522
Oh, hey, who are you bringing
to the wedding?

14:57.564 --> 14:59.983
I’ve got this guy, George,
I’m not sure if he’s the one,

15:00.025 --> 15:01.443
but he does have a timeshare.

15:01.484 --> 15:02.944
-Timeshare is nice.

15:02.986 --> 15:05.363
-Oh, hey, my cousin Todd
needs a date.

15:05.405 --> 15:06.906
My aunt says he’s been playing
way too much

15:06.948 --> 15:08.283
World of Warcraft lately.

15:08.324 --> 15:10.243
-Why does everyone keep
asking me if I have a date?

15:10.285 --> 15:12.412
-Sorry, was just trying to help.

15:12.454 --> 15:13.621
-No, I’m sorry.

15:13.663 --> 15:15.665
I didn’t mean to jump on you
like that.

15:15.707 --> 15:18.418
I’ve just been getting
that question a lot lately.

15:18.460 --> 15:21.338
-We just don’t want you
to be sad, Trish.

15:21.379 --> 15:22.839
-It just so happens,

15:22.881 --> 15:24.716
I actually do have someone
accompanying me to the weddings.

15:24.758 --> 15:26.343
-To all three?
Do I know him?

15:26.384 --> 15:28.553
-Um... You might.

15:28.595 --> 15:29.637
-Ryan!

15:32.640 --> 15:33.933
-Hey!
-Hi!

15:33.975 --> 15:35.018
-There he is.

15:35.060 --> 15:37.479
-You made it, brother!
-Oh, my...

15:38.813 --> 15:39.981
[needle scratch]
-Sorry.

15:40.982 --> 15:42.317
-I don’t know how he does it,

15:42.359 --> 15:44.569
but Ryan Peterson always manages
to make an entrance.

15:44.611 --> 15:45.528
-Mmhm.

15:45.820 --> 15:47.113
-[Carrie] He's still got it.

15:48.406 --> 15:49.240
-Well?

15:51.409 --> 15:52.744
-What?

15:52.786 --> 15:54.954
-Aren’t you going to go say hi
to your boyfriend?

15:54.996 --> 15:57.457
-Oh, he’s not my boyfriend.
He's...

15:59.000 --> 16:02.087
Um, you know what?
I’m gonna put this away.

16:12.764 --> 16:14.641
-Trish? I thought
that might be you.

16:14.683 --> 16:15.767
-Ryan.

16:15.809 --> 16:16.893
-It’s been a long time.

16:16.935 --> 16:18.687
-Hi, Ryan.

16:24.567 --> 16:26.319
Uh, let’s go dance.

16:26.361 --> 16:29.656
*

16:29.698 --> 16:35.578
* I have been looking
for peace of my mind... *

16:35.620 --> 16:39.624
Sorry, I, uh, wanted to get away
from certain eyes.

16:39.666 --> 16:41.835
They know that we’re
gonna be each other’s
date to these things,

16:41.876 --> 16:43.753
and I didn’t want a thousand
questions.

16:43.795 --> 16:44.796
-These things?

16:45.755 --> 16:47.257
-The weddings.

16:47.298 --> 16:50.677
-Ah, I’m overwhelmed
with your sentimentality.

16:50.719 --> 16:51.761
I’m happy to help.

16:53.221 --> 16:54.347
-It’s no big deal.

16:54.389 --> 16:55.682
I would have figured it out
for myself.

16:58.268 --> 17:01.688
So, uh, how’s Mozambique?

17:01.730 --> 17:03.231
-No idea.

17:03.273 --> 17:07.027
I’m sure it’s nice but not
as amazing as Morocco.

17:07.068 --> 17:08.361
-Morocco. Yes.

17:08.403 --> 17:09.446
-Right, right.

17:09.487 --> 17:11.448
-I was misinformed.

17:11.489 --> 17:16.411
I saw your spread of New Zealand
on the Nat Geo website.

17:16.453 --> 17:19.456
It was really cool.
Looked like another planet.

17:19.497 --> 17:22.042
-Glad to see you two
are catching up.

17:22.083 --> 17:23.877
-Did Trish tell you she’s
writing a story

17:23.918 --> 17:26.463
about our friend group
for her magazine?

17:27.130 --> 17:29.382
-You got everyone to agree?

17:29.424 --> 17:30.759
-Even Michelle.

17:30.800 --> 17:31.843
-Impressive.

17:33.094 --> 17:34.387
You going to include the part
about your date

17:34.429 --> 17:36.431
being someone you barely
remember from high school?

17:38.391 --> 17:42.187
-I might leave that part out.
Thanks for the dance.

17:50.820 --> 17:54.157
*

17:58.661 --> 18:01.998
-Paterson, I’m taking off.
Just so you know.

18:02.040 --> 18:04.459
-Thanks, betrayer
who’s betrayed me.

18:04.501 --> 18:06.961
-You're up early.
Working on your article?

18:07.003 --> 18:08.338
-Are you kidding?

18:08.380 --> 18:10.215
Do you know how many events
you guys have planned?

18:10.256 --> 18:11.841
I may never sleep again.

18:11.883 --> 18:12.967
You only have to be
at one wedding,

18:13.009 --> 18:14.302
I have to attend all three.

18:14.344 --> 18:16.137
Ok, I’m like in some wedding
zombie movie

18:16.179 --> 18:18.223
where the undead just keep
coming and coming.

18:18.264 --> 18:20.225
-Did you just compare
the happiest day of my life

18:20.266 --> 18:22.519
to a zombie movie?
Aww.

18:24.229 --> 18:25.313
-[Sean] Hey.

18:26.564 --> 18:29.275
-Hey, guys.
Working on your piece?

18:29.317 --> 18:31.778
-And that’s my cue
to take off.

18:31.820 --> 18:34.739
I’ll catch you two cool cats
in a couple weeks.

18:34.781 --> 18:35.990
-Alright. Have a good trip.

18:36.032 --> 18:37.242
-Thanks.

18:38.743 --> 18:44.124
-Hey, I uh, actually wanted
to apologize for last night.

18:44.165 --> 18:45.333
-About what?

18:47.043 --> 18:49.129
-Well, I kind of object
to how everyone thinks

18:49.170 --> 18:50.630
I need a date
to these weddings,

18:50.672 --> 18:58.054
so I was a little abrupt
with you, so sorry about that.

18:58.096 --> 19:01.474
-No need for an apology.
Totally get it.

19:01.516 --> 19:03.518
Maybe we should
just drop everything.

19:04.394 --> 19:06.271
-We’ll attend the weddings,
but separately.

19:08.648 --> 19:10.025
-Okay then.
-Done.

19:10.066 --> 19:12.277
-Good.
-Great.

19:14.070 --> 19:16.322
-Shoot, I gotta run.

19:16.364 --> 19:18.283
I have to be at a bridal shower
in an hour.

19:18.324 --> 19:20.243
-Don’t those usually happen
weeks before the wedding?

19:20.285 --> 19:22.704
-Yeah, but no one
was in town.

19:22.746 --> 19:23.747
[crunch]

19:26.750 --> 19:32.005
No! No, no, no, no, no....

19:32.047 --> 19:35.050
Uh. I blame you for this.

19:35.091 --> 19:36.426
-What did I do?

19:36.468 --> 19:38.720
-This is June and Peter’s
special record

19:38.762 --> 19:40.638
that they were gonna play
for their first dance tomorrow.

19:40.680 --> 19:41.890
Now look at it.

19:43.141 --> 19:45.060
[sighs]

19:45.101 --> 19:47.020
-This look very rare.

19:47.062 --> 19:48.980
-Yeah, apparently.

19:49.022 --> 19:52.901
Well, I guess I’ll just have
to download the song now.

19:52.942 --> 19:55.737
-You don’t really understand
weddings, do you?

19:55.779 --> 19:57.238
-What? Sure, I do.

19:57.280 --> 19:58.740
-No, because if you did
you’d understand

19:58.782 --> 20:00.784
it’s the only day where you try
to get everything

20:00.825 --> 20:02.911
absolutely everything right.

20:02.952 --> 20:05.622
Ok, there’s no compromises.
No cutting corners.

20:05.663 --> 20:06.915
You’re gonna have
to find another copy

20:06.956 --> 20:08.124
before their first dance.

20:08.166 --> 20:09.125
-I don’t have time for that.

20:09.167 --> 20:10.502
I have a wedding shower
to attend.

20:10.543 --> 20:12.420
-Then you’ll have to make
an excuse and get away.

20:12.462 --> 20:15.548
And since I feel somewhat
responsible, I will help you.

20:15.590 --> 20:18.093
I’m thinking that we meet on
the corner of Main and Junction

20:18.134 --> 20:19.636
in an hour and a half.

20:20.970 --> 20:22.138
-Are you serious?

20:22.180 --> 20:24.432
-Main and Junction.
Hour and a half.

20:30.146 --> 20:34.317
[upbeat music]

20:37.278 --> 20:38.655
-Hey!

20:38.697 --> 20:40.448
-Oh thank goodness you’re here.
I need your help.

20:40.490 --> 20:42.784
Um, can you hand these out
to everyone?

20:42.826 --> 20:44.744
Everyone has to take
a party favor token.

20:44.786 --> 20:47.330
And you either get a session
with the palm reader

20:47.372 --> 20:48.707
or a foot massage.

20:49.040 --> 20:50.792
-Got it.

20:50.834 --> 20:53.128
-I’m so excited you and Ryan are
going to the wedding together.

20:53.169 --> 20:54.671
He’s so handsome.

20:54.713 --> 20:57.799
-Yeah, he’s gonna age badly
though, I can tell.

20:57.841 --> 20:59.384
[laughs]

20:59.426 --> 21:04.347
-Oh! Palm reader.
Maybe I can tell your fortune.

21:04.389 --> 21:06.016
-I think it would be weird
if my fortune

21:06.057 --> 21:09.310
was written on your palm,
but, ok.

21:09.352 --> 21:11.646
-Hey, when did you
and Ryan

21:11.688 --> 21:13.857
decide to go to weddings
together?

21:13.898 --> 21:15.775
-We didn’t really decide.

21:15.817 --> 21:19.696
Actually, it was kind of
your fiancé’s idea.

21:19.738 --> 21:23.658
But, uh, we’re changing that.
We’re gonna go separately now.

21:23.700 --> 21:28.038
-So you’re gonna arrive
separately but sit together?

21:28.079 --> 21:29.664
-Yeah. That’s the plan.

21:29.706 --> 21:31.666
-You know what they say
about the best laid plans.

21:31.708 --> 21:34.002
-That they always
work out perfectly?

21:34.044 --> 21:35.879
-Oooh! Yay!

21:35.920 --> 21:37.839
Who doesn’t love a good
foot massage.

21:37.881 --> 21:40.717
-Ugh. I’m always worried
they’re gonna judge my pedicure.

21:40.759 --> 21:43.178
-Is there anything that
you just sit back and enjoy?

21:43.219 --> 21:44.846
-Not really, no.

21:44.888 --> 21:46.890
-You’re talking to the girl
who decided to wear all black

21:46.931 --> 21:48.433
her sophomore year.

21:48.475 --> 21:51.436
-Hey, that was a totally
defensible fashion choice.

21:51.478 --> 21:54.439
Uh, but sorry to do this ladies,

21:54.481 --> 21:57.317
I actually have
to bow out today.

21:57.359 --> 21:57.942
-What?

21:57.984 --> 21:59.569
-I know. I know.

21:59.611 --> 22:01.738
I have something I have
to take care of.

22:02.739 --> 22:03.990
-What?
-Why?

22:04.032 --> 22:05.867
-Yeah, but I’ll see you guys
later. Have fun!

22:05.909 --> 22:07.160
-T?
-But...

22:10.413 --> 22:12.665
-She hates Ryan,
I can tell.

22:12.707 --> 22:14.834
-That girl needs a massage
and some cookies.

22:14.876 --> 22:15.752
-Yes.

22:16.670 --> 22:19.047
*

22:24.427 --> 22:26.638
[motorcycle motor running]

22:26.680 --> 22:28.390
-Of course you ride
a motorcycle.

22:28.431 --> 22:31.226
-It’s Sean’s.
I'm just borrowing it.

22:31.267 --> 22:33.895
So, I did a little googling
and apparently

22:33.937 --> 22:37.565
any record by Sheryl Townsend
is really hard to find.

22:37.607 --> 22:40.402
Especially an original pressing
of a 45 single.

22:40.443 --> 22:42.112
-See, this is why I don’t
like weddings.

22:42.153 --> 22:44.781
Everyone loses their mind
about the littlest things.

22:44.823 --> 22:48.284
-Well, look at it this way,
if we’re successful,

22:48.326 --> 22:49.703
maybe you’ll have something
to write about.

22:50.954 --> 22:52.914
Let’s start with the record shop
and thrift store.

22:52.956 --> 22:54.124
Maybe we’ll get lucky.

22:55.583 --> 22:58.211
*

22:59.963 --> 23:00.755
-This is rare.

23:00.797 --> 23:01.798
-For sure.

23:03.800 --> 23:04.884
-Really rare!

23:04.926 --> 23:06.136
-I know.

23:08.471 --> 23:10.098
-If we had it, it would
be over there.

23:15.311 --> 23:16.855
Alright, let's see what we got.

23:18.064 --> 23:21.985
Nope, nope, nope, nope.

23:27.073 --> 23:28.116
Nope.

23:29.826 --> 23:31.619
Sorry. No luck.

23:31.661 --> 23:33.621
-Is there anywhere you could
recommend to look?

23:33.663 --> 23:36.624
-In this town?
I don't know.

23:36.666 --> 23:40.170
Try the thrift store.
But that’s a real Hail Mary.

23:41.755 --> 23:43.131
-Ok.

23:43.173 --> 23:44.257
-Great, thank you.

23:44.299 --> 23:45.508
-Alright.

23:48.178 --> 23:52.682
*

24:01.649 --> 24:04.652
-No, it doesn’t have to be
a 45. Could be on LP.

24:04.694 --> 24:06.654
Yeah, yeah, I’ll wait.

24:07.655 --> 24:10.325
Uh huh, yeah, that’s the one.

24:10.367 --> 24:12.702
Yeah, can you put it aside
for us?

24:12.744 --> 24:15.997
Yep, great, great.
No, money’s no concern.

24:16.039 --> 24:17.082
Thank you.

24:17.499 --> 24:19.292
-Money’s no concern?

24:19.334 --> 24:21.711
-So they have a copy.
Only one.

24:21.753 --> 24:23.755
But it's too late
to overnight it

24:23.797 --> 24:25.382
in time for the reception, so...

24:25.423 --> 24:28.802
-You’re sure that we can’t just
apologize to Peter and June

24:28.843 --> 24:30.970
and get back to tacos
and margaritas?

24:31.012 --> 24:33.598
-It’s impressive how hard you’re
holding onto that cynicism.

24:33.640 --> 24:36.518
-Ok, I prefer to think of it
as realism, not cynicism.

24:36.559 --> 24:38.186
-Come on, it’s the ritual.

24:38.228 --> 24:40.522
Every couple has their ritual
or two, you know?

24:40.563 --> 24:42.107
Going back to the place
they first met,

24:42.148 --> 24:44.567
listening to the song
they first danced to.

24:45.235 --> 24:48.613
Love’s kind of a conspiracy
against the world.

24:49.781 --> 24:51.741
Rituals we have prove that.

24:52.492 --> 24:53.535
-Fire in my mouth.

24:53.576 --> 24:56.287
-Oh, uh, buddy,
she ate a habanero.

24:56.329 --> 24:59.582
Do you have any queso fundito?
Cheesier the better.

24:59.624 --> 25:01.376
-Ah. Queso.

25:01.418 --> 25:04.379
I know that means cheese
but oh, this is bad.

25:04.421 --> 25:05.714
-Yeah.
-This is really bad.

25:05.755 --> 25:08.133
-Queso fundito, it’s a melted
cheese skillet.

25:08.174 --> 25:09.759
The grease will help cut down
the heat.

25:09.801 --> 25:11.302
I learned that in Jalisco.

25:11.344 --> 25:13.221
The locals there thought it was
funny to add extra chilies

25:13.263 --> 25:14.180
to my tamales, so...

25:14.222 --> 25:15.849
Thank you,
thank you so much.

25:15.890 --> 25:16.725
-Thanks.

25:22.439 --> 25:23.940
-It should start working
any second.

25:25.358 --> 25:26.735
-Ok.
-Yeah?

25:26.776 --> 25:29.487
-That actually helped.
-Yeah? Better?

25:29.529 --> 25:30.822
Well I...  I’m gonna
head back to the city.

25:30.864 --> 25:32.949
-Oh, wait, no, I mean,
I’m the one who broke it.

25:32.991 --> 25:34.993
I can be the one
that goes to get it.

25:36.494 --> 25:38.496
-You’re a bridesmaid, Trish,

25:38.538 --> 25:40.415
you can’t disappear on the day
of the wedding.

25:40.457 --> 25:42.042
Besides, the only way
to make it on time

25:42.083 --> 25:44.919
is if I take the bike
to beat the traffic, ok?

25:44.961 --> 25:46.838
-But it’s over five hours
each way.

25:46.880 --> 25:48.340
You’ll be riding all night.

25:48.381 --> 25:51.384
-I will be alright, ok?
Wish me luck.

25:56.348 --> 26:00.352
*

26:08.151 --> 26:10.487
-You should mention how cool
a curated playlist

26:10.528 --> 26:12.781
is as a party favor
in your article.

26:12.822 --> 26:14.699
-Hm, it’s not that kind
of piece.

26:15.700 --> 26:18.787
-I thought you wrote
for a lifestyle magazine?

26:18.828 --> 26:20.997
-I do, it’s just uh,

26:21.039 --> 26:24.042
not really writing about
the style of the weddings.

26:24.084 --> 26:26.503
I’m more interested in how
the couples

26:26.544 --> 26:28.338
end up dealing
with all the stresses

26:28.380 --> 26:30.340
and everything that come
with them.

26:30.382 --> 26:32.008
-I totally agree.

26:32.050 --> 26:34.511
I wanted my wedding to Sean
to be a calm oasis

26:34.552 --> 26:36.179
celebrating our love.

26:36.221 --> 26:38.890
Instead, I’m left handling
everything on my own

26:38.932 --> 26:42.811
and sometimes it feels like
an exhausting dumpster fire.

26:44.729 --> 26:48.316
-Hey. Are you alight?
I should be helping you more.

26:48.358 --> 26:52.195
-You? No, you have too much
on your plate already.

26:52.237 --> 26:53.822
It’s all good.

26:54.739 --> 26:58.159
Anyway, I like the sound
of your article

26:58.201 --> 26:59.327
I’d ready it.

26:59.994 --> 27:02.122
-Great. That’s one so far.

27:06.418 --> 27:07.752
-Are you looking for someone?

27:09.462 --> 27:14.009
-No, no.
I’m just, uh, you know,

27:14.050 --> 27:16.970
wondering when things
are gonna get underway.

27:17.012 --> 27:18.888
-Hm.

-[Female Voice] Everyone
take your places, we are
about to begin the ceremony.

beautiful music together.

seen Ryan?

here somewhere.

-Honey!

28:46.476 --> 28:47.894
You remembered?

28:47.936 --> 28:52.232
-Of course, babe. How could
I forget? Come here.

28:57.028 --> 29:04.202

29:20.218 --> 29:24.514
-So what’s like your Mount
Everest as a photographer?

29:24.556 --> 29:27.809
Or is it the actual Everest?

29:27.851 --> 29:29.227
It’s the actually Everest,
isn’t it?

29:29.269 --> 29:31.938
-No, I've already done that.
-[both chuckle]

29:31.980 --> 29:33.356
-Of course you have.

29:33.398 --> 29:35.692
Like riding motorcycles
and wrestling alligators.

29:35.734 --> 29:37.027
-Well, my dream would be

29:37.068 --> 29:40.864
photographing the
Aurora Australis.

29:40.905 --> 29:42.699
-Is it kind of like
the Aurora Borealis?

29:42.741 --> 29:45.201
-Right, but in the southern
hemisphere.

29:45.243 --> 29:47.537
It’s only visible a few months
out of the year,

29:47.579 --> 29:51.207
very few photographers
have had the chance to do it.

29:51.249 --> 29:54.461
But I’m uh, I’m hoping
for the opportunity.

29:54.502 --> 29:55.837
-Well, it sounds spectacular.

29:55.879 --> 29:57.922
-Yeah, but I’m not holding
my breath.

29:57.964 --> 29:59.716
I’ve been close so many times

29:59.758 --> 30:02.886
and there's always some sort
of setback.

30:02.927 --> 30:05.764
The weather, the cost,

30:05.805 --> 30:08.725
the magazine doesn't think
it's worthwhile...

30:08.767 --> 30:11.061
-So if you were to go,
when would it be?

30:11.102 --> 30:13.063
-It could be anytime now.

30:13.104 --> 30:15.732
Like I said, it depends.

30:15.774 --> 30:18.234
I was supposed to go before,

30:18.276 --> 30:22.155
but my girlfriend at the time
wasn’t very supportive.

30:22.197 --> 30:24.616
-What happened
with this girlfriend?

30:27.077 --> 30:32.207
-We broke up because she didn’t
want me to go, so.

30:33.792 --> 30:35.126
-Aren’t you two gonna go dance?

30:35.168 --> 30:36.961
George knows how much
I love to dance.

30:37.003 --> 30:38.588
Don’t you, George?

30:38.630 --> 30:40.715
-Learning every day.

30:40.757 --> 30:41.549
Oh.

30:42.634 --> 30:45.387
*

30:45.428 --> 30:47.597
-May I have this dance?

30:47.639 --> 30:51.768
*

30:51.810 --> 30:53.436
-If you insist.

30:53.478 --> 31:04.197
*

31:04.239 --> 31:08.451
*

31:11.579 --> 31:15.959
-And now, it’s time
for my beautiful bride

31:16.001 --> 31:20.505
to bestow the bouquet onto
one lucky single lady.

31:20.547 --> 31:22.507
So, uh, everyone make your way
to the centre of the floor.

31:22.549 --> 31:23.883
-Get in there, T.

31:23.925 --> 31:26.636
-Oh, no.
Not my jam.

31:26.678 --> 31:29.973
-Do you want me to rescind my
cooperation for your article?

31:30.015 --> 31:31.975
Get out there.

31:32.017 --> 31:33.893
-You must be a really
good lawyer.

31:33.935 --> 31:35.270
-Go.

31:35.311 --> 31:36.521
-Ok.

31:40.775 --> 31:41.735
-Ready ladies?

31:41.776 --> 31:42.736
[cheering]

31:43.903 --> 31:46.698
One, two, three!

31:56.041 --> 31:59.836
-[cheering]

31:59.878 --> 32:02.255
-This is so going
in the article.

32:07.761 --> 32:11.097
*

32:17.604 --> 32:18.813
-[Trish] No, no.

32:19.898 --> 32:21.274
Not a step closer.

32:22.442 --> 32:23.693
-I’m sorry?

32:24.778 --> 32:26.112
-I know this is your house,

32:26.154 --> 32:27.947
I know I’m just
a visitor here

32:27.989 --> 32:30.033
and that I have no right
to say this,

32:30.075 --> 32:32.243
but I need you to not come
any closer.

32:32.285 --> 32:33.703
-Ok.

32:33.745 --> 32:35.288
-I’m just, I’m never gonna
get started on my piece

32:35.330 --> 32:36.915
if I don’t have some time
on my own.

32:36.956 --> 32:38.124
Some silence.

32:38.833 --> 32:39.709
Sorry.

32:41.628 --> 32:44.964
-Well, I’ve got my own writing
to do as best man.

32:45.006 --> 32:46.508
You won’t even know I’m here.

32:48.968 --> 32:50.387
[sighs]

33:00.230 --> 33:02.607
-Sorry, I feel like that was
kind of rude

33:02.649 --> 33:05.402
to tell you you can’t step
onto your own dock.

33:05.443 --> 33:07.612
-No worries.
I totally get it.

33:09.656 --> 33:12.826
I have been struggling with
this speech for weeks now.

33:15.161 --> 33:20.458
-You know... never mind.

33:20.500 --> 33:22.127
-What?

33:22.168 --> 33:26.464
-No, I don’t want to interfere.
I’m always getting these ideas.

33:26.506 --> 33:30.301
It’s kind of a fault of mine.
Trying to control everything.

33:30.343 --> 33:32.345
-I will let you know
if you are interfering.

33:36.433 --> 33:38.309
-You’re not a writer, right?

33:38.351 --> 33:40.061
-No, definitely not.

33:40.103 --> 33:43.982
-Ok, so, why do a speech?

33:44.024 --> 33:46.067
You should do what comes
naturally to you.

33:46.109 --> 33:47.318
What you’re good at.

33:47.360 --> 33:48.903
-[both] Photography.

33:51.031 --> 33:52.657
-Yeah.

33:52.699 --> 33:54.367
-I love that.

33:55.493 --> 33:57.912
I mean, it’s a little
unconventional,

33:57.954 --> 34:03.668
but uh, you like to think
outside the box, don’t you?

34:03.710 --> 34:04.878
-Sometimes.

34:08.923 --> 34:11.009
I am supposed to be at
Michelle’s in 20 minutes.

34:11.051 --> 34:11.968
What is wrong with me?

34:12.010 --> 34:13.094
-Hm.

34:13.136 --> 34:14.387
-Too much going on.

34:25.398 --> 34:27.275
-[Trish] I wish I could pack
like this.

34:27.317 --> 34:28.485
-You think this is impressive,

34:28.526 --> 34:30.570
you should see my shoe closet
in the city.

34:30.612 --> 34:32.364
-Did you tell Trish
about London?

34:34.616 --> 34:38.870
-Rod got offered a prime
research position in London.

34:38.912 --> 34:39.996
-Oh.

34:40.038 --> 34:41.498
-It’s an amazing offer.

34:41.539 --> 34:43.667
I’ve always wanted
to get into research.

34:43.708 --> 34:46.920
There’s way less wear on
the body than being on call.

34:48.421 --> 34:50.215
Michelle and I are just trying
to figure out

34:50.256 --> 34:53.176
if we can uproot
our lives for it.

34:53.218 --> 34:55.387
-Or whether we do the long
distance thing again.

34:55.428 --> 34:57.263
-It's just, I’m not sure

34:57.305 --> 34:59.224
when another opportunity like
this will come up again.

34:59.265 --> 35:01.059
-I understand.

35:01.101 --> 35:03.853
It’s just, I have a career too
and with the time difference

35:03.895 --> 35:05.063
and the legal system,

35:05.105 --> 35:06.940
I can’t do my job
from London.

35:09.442 --> 35:12.612
-Well, maybe it’ll turn
into an adventure.

35:14.489 --> 35:15.532
-Maybe.

35:23.415 --> 35:25.291
-You guys’ll figure it out.

35:37.303 --> 35:39.472
[phone ringing]

35:43.810 --> 35:45.395
Hey, Dani.

35:45.437 --> 35:46.479
-How’s the story coming?
You gonna make your deadline?

35:46.521 --> 35:48.690
-Deadline?
What deadline?

35:48.732 --> 35:50.442
Why are you whispering?
Are you at work?

35:50.483 --> 35:52.152
-You need to turn
in your story asap.

35:52.193 --> 35:55.280
-Why? Helen didn’t give me
a hard deadline.

35:55.321 --> 35:56.948
I was actually gonna ask
for a bit more time.

35:56.990 --> 35:57.824
-No!

35:58.616 --> 36:00.660
-What? Why?

36:00.702 --> 36:02.579
What’s going on?

36:02.620 --> 36:04.039
-[sighs] I wasn’t supposed
to tell you this,

36:04.080 --> 36:06.583
but the August feature
fell through.

36:06.624 --> 36:08.126
Helen’s looking at other stories

36:08.168 --> 36:10.920
and she hinted that she’s
considering yours for the spot.

36:10.962 --> 36:12.088
-But I’m only one wedding in.

36:12.130 --> 36:13.381
-Did you hear me?

36:13.423 --> 36:15.133
Trish... it’s the feature.

36:15.175 --> 36:17.594
Remember when Renee
got her first feature?

36:17.635 --> 36:21.056
It blew up and now Helen lets
her write anything she wants.

36:21.097 --> 36:22.182
-True.

36:22.223 --> 36:24.726
-Come on, Trish,
you can do this.

36:24.768 --> 36:26.686
This is what you’ve been working
towards for years.

36:26.728 --> 36:28.688
Plus, it’ll be a break
for me too

36:28.730 --> 36:31.816
because then I can take
over your duties.

36:31.858 --> 36:33.860
Please. Focus.

36:35.195 --> 36:36.571
-Ok, yeah.
You’re right.

36:36.613 --> 36:40.158
I just need to buckle down.
No more distractions.

36:40.200 --> 36:41.534
I’m on it.

36:43.870 --> 36:45.413
[sighs]

36:54.798 --> 36:56.174
-Wine tasting party
is an elegant way

36:56.216 --> 36:57.634
to start wedding festivities.

36:57.676 --> 36:59.469
You should put that
in your article.

36:59.511 --> 37:03.473
-It’s not that kind of-
Never mind.

37:03.515 --> 37:05.183
-Sorry, I was just trying
to help.

37:05.225 --> 37:06.726
-I know.

37:06.768 --> 37:09.354
I just really need this story
to be taken seriously.

37:09.396 --> 37:11.773
It's my chance to escape
being an assistant.

37:12.607 --> 37:14.776
-So when you do get there,

37:14.818 --> 37:16.861
what kinds of stories
will you write?

37:16.903 --> 37:21.241
-Stories that move people.
surprise them.

37:21.282 --> 37:22.784
Maybe even challenge them.

37:25.995 --> 37:29.416
-Here. Try this one.
It tastes like blackberries.

37:33.253 --> 37:34.921
-Oh, it does.

37:34.963 --> 37:37.674
Maybe I’ll buy a few bottles
and bring them back to New York.

37:37.716 --> 37:40.760
-It’s not a bad idea.
I might do the same.

37:41.594 --> 37:42.721
-Oh.

37:42.762 --> 37:43.805
-What?

37:44.472 --> 37:46.057
-You have a home?

37:46.891 --> 37:48.560
-[chuckles] What makes you think
I don’t have a home?

37:48.601 --> 37:52.230
-Well, you’re like a citizen
of the world.

37:52.272 --> 37:54.065
-Ok.

37:54.107 --> 37:55.984
-I don’t know.
Sean always made it sound like

37:56.026 --> 37:57.485
you live between hotel rooms.

37:57.527 --> 37:59.612
-Well, I do, mostly.

37:59.654 --> 38:02.407
But I also have a small
crash pad in New York.

38:02.449 --> 38:04.075
It’s become more of
a storage unit

38:04.117 --> 38:05.994
for all my equipment, really.

38:06.036 --> 38:09.122
But I do pay rent there,
so technically it is my home.

38:10.331 --> 38:11.791
-That sounds...

38:13.251 --> 38:16.046
Well, awful. I’m sorry, it does.

38:16.087 --> 38:17.088
-It’s not that bad.

38:17.130 --> 38:18.298
-Mm.

38:18.340 --> 38:19.841
-Ok, maybe it is.
[chuckles]

38:21.968 --> 38:24.054
*

38:26.306 --> 38:27.182
-Hi.

38:29.392 --> 38:31.227
-Hey, Mr. Fiancé, what’s up?

38:31.269 --> 38:32.937
-Can I just speak to her?

38:32.979 --> 38:34.606
-Speak to who?

38:34.647 --> 38:36.775
-Michelle, isn’t she with you?
I thought she must be with you.

38:36.816 --> 38:38.193
-No, I’m supposed to meet June

38:38.234 --> 38:39.986
and write 10,000
thank you cards.

38:40.028 --> 38:41.613
-Michelle’s been missing
since this morning.

38:41.654 --> 38:43.615
I’ve looked everywhere for her.

38:43.656 --> 38:47.535
-Oh. Ok, uh, let me try and
I’ll call you when I reach her.

38:47.577 --> 38:49.537
-Please, the minute you do.

38:49.579 --> 38:52.749
And thanks, Trish,
I appreciate it.

38:52.791 --> 38:54.000
-Of course.

38:57.003 --> 38:59.005
-[voicemail] Hey, it’s Michelle,
leave a message.

39:04.260 --> 39:07.222
*

39:13.895 --> 39:15.855
-Only you would know
where to look.

39:17.065 --> 39:18.566
I might be a good lawyer

39:18.608 --> 39:20.610
but I think you’re gonna be
an even better journalist.

39:23.780 --> 39:25.240
Remember we used
to come out here

39:25.281 --> 39:28.076
when the boys were
driving us crazy?

39:28.118 --> 39:29.577
-Yeah.

39:29.619 --> 39:31.538
-I guess nothing changes, huh?

39:34.124 --> 39:37.335
-I can leave you alone if that’s
what you prefer, Michelle.

39:37.377 --> 39:38.545
-That's ok.

39:40.755 --> 39:42.799
But there’s something
you should know.

39:45.385 --> 39:46.928
The wedding’s off.

39:52.142 --> 39:56.312
*

40:16.291 --> 40:19.753
[typing]

40:19.794 --> 40:26.176
-Ok. Beekeeper, park ranger,
private investigator...

40:26.217 --> 40:27.177
Life coach.

40:29.179 --> 40:31.890
Yeah, for sure
not cut out for that one.

40:36.686 --> 40:39.189
Trish Paterson.

40:40.857 --> 40:44.861
There are three key attributes
to choosing a good nail polish.

40:44.903 --> 40:47.030
[laughs]

40:52.994 --> 40:53.953
[door opens]

40:56.664 --> 40:58.333
-Are you sure this is ok?

40:58.375 --> 41:01.378
I just don’t think I can face
going home tonight.

41:01.419 --> 41:03.254
-Oh, I’m sure Ryan won’t mind.

41:03.296 --> 41:04.464
-Ryan won’t mind what?

41:06.007 --> 41:08.093
-Uh, Michelle needs a place
to stay tonight.

41:08.134 --> 41:10.178
Is it ok if she camps out
in the spare room?

41:10.220 --> 41:11.471
-Of course.

41:11.513 --> 41:12.847
You know you’re always
welcome here, Michelle.

41:14.641 --> 41:15.809
-Come on.

41:18.603 --> 41:19.854
-I’ll just be upstairs.

41:19.896 --> 41:21.731
-No, no, you should stay.
It’s your house.

41:27.821 --> 41:29.364
-What happened?

41:29.406 --> 41:35.036
-So you know how my sensitivity
chip can go offline sometimes.

41:35.078 --> 41:38.415
So Rod comes home from a
particularity grueling day

41:38.456 --> 41:39.916
and I just blurt out,

41:39.958 --> 41:41.876
I don’t want to go to London
with you.

41:43.461 --> 41:44.921
-Oh.

41:44.963 --> 41:46.256
-So, pretty quickly it turns
into a heated argument

41:46.297 --> 41:51.720
and then Rod says to me
that I’m being

41:51.761 --> 41:53.847
a control freak
about the wedding.

41:53.888 --> 41:56.599
Of course I have been.
This is what I do.

41:56.641 --> 41:58.727
He used to love that about me.
I manage things.

41:58.768 --> 42:02.480
I took care of things.
When did it change?

42:02.522 --> 42:05.191
So I get mad and then
I say to him

42:05.233 --> 42:09.154
well, maybe we should just call
the whole thing off?

42:09.195 --> 42:12.282
And then he says...
maybe we should.

42:13.742 --> 42:14.784
[sighs]

42:16.453 --> 42:18.705
So, I think it’s off.

42:18.747 --> 42:20.415
-I’m so sorry, Michelle.

42:22.542 --> 42:24.085
-I can’t believe
this is happening.

42:24.127 --> 42:27.422
-You said you both have been
working really hard lately.

42:27.464 --> 42:29.466
It’s gotta just be the stress.

42:29.507 --> 42:33.219
-Absolutely. Stress.
That’s it.

42:33.261 --> 42:34.721
-Yeah, I guess.

42:34.763 --> 42:36.431
-It’ll all pass by tomorrow.

42:36.473 --> 42:38.058
You know when you get
into one of those arguments

42:38.099 --> 42:39.351
and it feels like the end of
the world

42:39.392 --> 42:41.603
and then the next day
you can’t even remember

42:41.644 --> 42:44.105
what you were fighting about?

42:44.147 --> 42:46.775
I’m sure it’s like that,
right, Ryan?

42:46.816 --> 42:48.151
-Right, sure.

42:48.985 --> 42:50.153
-Yeah, it could be.

42:53.782 --> 43:00.789
But that... doesn’t change
the fact that

43:00.830 --> 43:02.499
I don’t want to go
to London.

43:05.960 --> 43:07.212
-[Trish] Get some rest.

43:07.253 --> 43:08.213
-Sure. Thank you.

43:08.254 --> 43:10.173
-Of course.
Have a good sleep.

43:11.466 --> 43:13.009
[exhales]

43:18.431 --> 43:20.141
-What do we do?
-About what?

43:20.183 --> 43:22.560
-We have to try to fix this,
obviously.

43:22.602 --> 43:24.396
-I’m surprised.

43:24.437 --> 43:25.814
-Why? What do you mean?

43:25.855 --> 43:27.816
-Because you don’t
believe marriage.

43:27.857 --> 43:29.859
Now you’re writing an article
about how great it is.

43:32.987 --> 43:36.116
-I’m just saying,
they love each other,

43:36.157 --> 43:38.535
they’ve seen how stressful
all this is.

43:38.576 --> 43:40.870
Three weddings in three weeks.

43:40.912 --> 43:42.455
I mean, no one’s
quite themselves.

43:42.497 --> 43:43.832
-True.

43:43.873 --> 43:45.083
-Do you really think
Michelle and Rod

43:45.125 --> 43:46.418
are making their best decisions
right now?

43:46.459 --> 43:47.585
-Probably not.

43:48.294 --> 43:50.088
-So, shouldn’t we help them
get to a place

43:50.130 --> 43:52.173
where that’s at least
a possibility?

43:52.215 --> 43:54.843
Instead of pretending that
they have everything in hand.

43:54.884 --> 43:57.470
-Alright then, what do you
propose we do?

43:58.680 --> 44:00.932
-I don’t know, exactly.

44:00.974 --> 44:02.267
-I mean, you’re the writer.

44:02.308 --> 44:05.145
And this is your chance
to rewrite the story.

44:05.186 --> 44:06.604
-Ok.

44:06.646 --> 44:10.066
So, if all of this is happening
because Rod and Michelle

44:10.108 --> 44:11.985
aren’t at their best
due to all these pressures

44:12.027 --> 44:13.194
that they’re under.

44:13.236 --> 44:14.654
-Mmhm.

44:14.696 --> 44:17.824
-Is there some way that we
could return them to a time

44:17.866 --> 44:19.909
when they were
their best selves?

44:21.661 --> 44:23.371
Like when they first
fell in love.

44:23.413 --> 44:24.414
-It’s brilliant.

44:25.582 --> 44:26.583
How do we do that?

44:26.624 --> 44:27.709
-I have no idea.

44:27.751 --> 44:29.544
[laughs]
-Right. Okay.

44:29.586 --> 44:30.879
-Okay. Give me the evening,

44:30.920 --> 44:33.256
I will come up with something,
uh, you know,

44:33.298 --> 44:35.133
another deadline is exactly
what I need.

44:35.175 --> 44:39.179
-Right. Well then,
I’ll see you.

44:39.220 --> 44:40.597
-In the morning.
-See you in the morning.

44:40.638 --> 44:42.098
- In the morning, great.

44:42.140 --> 44:43.641
-Yeah. Goodnight.
-Goodnight, goodnight.

-Yeah.

-Hey, how’re you doing?

45:03.411 --> 45:06.748
-Well I just don’t think I can
face going back today.

45:06.790 --> 45:08.166
-Did you get any sleep?

45:08.792 --> 45:10.377
-Not really.

45:10.418 --> 45:13.505
I cried so much I think I used
up all the Kleenex in the house.

45:13.546 --> 45:15.632
I just don’t think I can do
today’s events.

45:17.008 --> 45:19.427
-Well, did you want me to call
around, cancel things?

45:20.970 --> 45:22.764
-Not yet, no.

45:22.806 --> 45:24.516
-We’ll go, we’ll try on dresses

45:24.557 --> 45:26.643
and then I’ll take you for a
cocktail before you head home.

45:30.814 --> 45:36.111
-T, I think... deep down,

45:36.152 --> 45:39.614
that that’s why I wasn’t sure
about your article.

45:41.574 --> 45:43.660
Bride number two runs away
from her wedding

45:43.702 --> 45:47.163
a day before the big event.
It’s hardly inspiring stuff.

45:51.251 --> 45:56.881
-Michelle, there is no one
who doesn’t find you inspiring.

45:56.923 --> 45:59.342
Trust me.

45:59.384 --> 46:01.511
Your biggest fan is sitting
right here.

46:06.850 --> 46:08.351
-Thank you, T.

46:12.272 --> 46:16.901
-Hey, I uh, I forgot my computer
in the guest house

46:16.943 --> 46:18.820
so I’ll meet you out front
in a minute. Ok?

46:18.862 --> 46:20.196
-K.

sure exactly

46:57.192 --> 46:58.068
what you were talking about...

46:58.109 --> 46:59.694
-There's no time.

46:59.736 --> 47:00.945
I have to meet Michelle out
front for a bridesmaid event.

47:00.987 --> 47:02.197
-That’s good, isn’t it?

47:02.238 --> 47:03.239
I mean, if she was gonna
break things off...

47:03.281 --> 47:04.741
-How did you survive
those war zones?

47:04.783 --> 47:06.618
Anyway, I only have a few
seconds so here’s the plan.

47:06.659 --> 47:08.203
-Ok.

47:08.244 --> 47:09.287
-Ok, I’m gonna take Michelle
to the bridal fitting

47:09.329 --> 47:10.663
then I’m gonna take her
for a drink.

47:10.705 --> 47:12.207
She thinks we’re going
for just a drink,

47:12.248 --> 47:14.167
but we’re actually gonna be
going to Di Marco's.

47:14.209 --> 47:15.794
That’s where Rod and Michelle
first met.

47:15.835 --> 47:18.213
He was working in the kitchen,
she was a waitress, right?

47:18.254 --> 47:19.089
-Hm.

47:19.130 --> 47:20.548
-They fell in love there.

47:20.590 --> 47:22.217
You’re gonna go get Rod
while she’s in the fitting

47:22.258 --> 47:23.885
you’re gonna take him,
she’s not gonna know he’s there,

47:23.927 --> 47:27.639
then I’m gonna bring her in,
she’s gonna see Rod, surprise.

47:27.681 --> 47:28.640
They’re back in love.

47:28.682 --> 47:29.474
-That’s, that’s great.
-Great.

47:29.516 --> 47:30.308
-Ok.
-Awesome.

47:30.350 --> 47:31.476
-See you there.
-Let's go.

47:33.937 --> 47:35.313
-I'm never gonna remember that.

-That was so much fun!
-All our dresses are amazing.

47:50.704 --> 47:53.039
-Ok, well I think I’m gonna get
this girl some rest

47:53.081 --> 47:54.290
but we’ll see you guys tomorrow.

47:54.332 --> 47:55.667
-Get some sleep.
-Bye.

47:56.918 --> 47:59.087
-If you can.
-Mmhmm.

47:59.129 --> 48:01.297
-Thank you ladies, I will see
you both tomorrow.

48:01.339 --> 48:02.298
Yes.

48:03.466 --> 48:06.052
-I’ve never seen a more
excited bride.

48:06.094 --> 48:07.929
It’s so romantic.

48:08.430 --> 48:10.015
-You really think that this will
make any difference?

48:10.056 --> 48:11.766
-Trish thinks it’s worth a shot.

48:13.560 --> 48:17.439
And isn’t the moment when
it's worth trying everything?

48:24.029 --> 48:26.698
-Thanks for taking care
of me, T,

48:26.740 --> 48:28.825
but I think I’m gonna head home.
I am wiped.

48:30.160 --> 48:31.661
-Are you sure?

48:31.703 --> 48:34.664
I was really hoping we could
spend a little time together.

48:35.373 --> 48:36.249
-Oh.

48:39.044 --> 48:40.837
Fine. One drink.

48:40.879 --> 48:42.339
-Absolutely.

48:45.175 --> 48:46.760
I thought we could go here.

48:47.177 --> 48:48.803
-No, I...
-One drink.

48:49.304 --> 48:50.513
Come on, we haven’t been
here in years.

48:50.555 --> 48:52.891
-Well... I don't know-
-Let's go.

49:00.190 --> 49:02.859
-Looks like a slow day.

49:02.901 --> 49:04.944
-This is where Rod and I met.

49:04.986 --> 49:07.739
He was working in the kitchen
and I was waiting tables.

49:10.450 --> 49:13.661
We used to close up together
almost every night.

49:13.703 --> 49:15.872
I think Mr. Di Marco knew
that something was going on

49:15.914 --> 49:17.791
because he started
closing earlier and earlier

49:17.832 --> 49:18.917
when he could.

49:28.051 --> 49:29.928
Hey, you.

49:29.969 --> 49:31.846
-Hey, beautiful.
Can we sit?

49:31.888 --> 49:33.306
-Yeah.

49:59.541 --> 50:01.918
-Thank you for making
that happen.

50:01.960 --> 50:04.004
-I'm trying to channel what
Trish Paterson would have said.

50:06.631 --> 50:07.757
-You know, I’m surprised
that someone

50:07.799 --> 50:10.093
who spends his life
wandering the world

50:10.135 --> 50:13.013
has turned out to be
such a romantic.

50:13.054 --> 50:14.264
-I actually find myself
romanticizing

50:14.305 --> 50:15.849
about going back home.

50:15.890 --> 50:17.058
Starting a real life.

50:21.563 --> 50:24.399
-Uh no, no way.
Not gonna happen.

50:52.177 --> 50:53.511
-What is it?

50:53.553 --> 50:56.014
-It’s just that I’m not certain

50:56.056 --> 50:59.100
what my article is even
about anymore.

50:59.142 --> 51:00.560
It’s less that I have
writers block

51:00.602 --> 51:02.645
and more that my
subject’s changed

51:02.687 --> 51:05.982
and I am not exactly sure
what's replacing it.

51:16.326 --> 51:18.370
-You have to have patience.

51:20.372 --> 51:22.665
Every time I go on an assignment

51:22.707 --> 51:26.294
I get half way through
and realize it’s all changed.

51:26.336 --> 51:27.754
-What do you do then?

51:27.796 --> 51:29.589
-I wait.

51:29.631 --> 51:32.217
Eventually the perfect moment,

51:32.258 --> 51:35.011
the perfect image
presents itself.

I just have to be there,
ready to grab it when it does.

51:41.059 --> 51:43.603
-The perfect moment.

51:43.645 --> 51:45.689
-But you have to wait for it.

51:45.730 --> 51:48.400
-Well how will I know
when it comes along?

worked everything out.

52:04.708 --> 52:06.251
-We did.

52:06.292 --> 52:08.044
-Good. Here I was afraid

52:08.086 --> 52:10.964
I was going to have to return
my bridesmaid dress.

52:11.006 --> 52:12.924
-Can you?
Return it?

52:16.469 --> 52:18.763
-Oh, you’re serious?

52:21.558 --> 52:25.061

the wedding.

52:25.103 --> 52:26.855
For real this time.

52:26.896 --> 52:30.233
Since you guys have helped us
so much to reach this decision,

52:30.275 --> 52:34.904
we wanted to let you know
right after we told our parents.

52:34.946 --> 52:37.907
-Um... uh.

52:37.949 --> 52:40.076
Wait, so you guys didn’t
settle anything?

52:40.118 --> 52:41.369
-No, we did.

52:41.411 --> 52:43.621
We just didn’t come
to the conclusion

52:43.663 --> 52:46.541
that you both thought
we would.

52:46.583 --> 52:49.544
We spent hours,
just the two of us,

52:49.586 --> 52:53.298
talking about what we really
wanted from our lives.

52:53.340 --> 52:57.719
-And we kept coming back
to the same conclusion.

52:57.761 --> 53:00.472
We both love our work too much
to give it up right now.

53:02.307 --> 53:04.267

53:04.309 --> 53:06.853

to this place.

already paid for,

we’re still having
the reception.

Hm. Like a failure.

how I went from

all these weddings

to feeling really sad that
this one isn’t happening.

that that perfect moment

but we knew it would be harder
on everyone else

56:24.300 --> 56:25.760
than either him or me.

56:25.802 --> 56:27.929
-Well, seems like everyone
is enjoying the party, so...

56:27.971 --> 56:30.181
-I was talking about you, Trish.

56:30.223 --> 56:31.725
I have been thinking
about your article.

56:31.766 --> 56:33.226
-Oh, Michelle...

56:33.268 --> 56:35.103
that's the last thing that
you should be thinking about.

56:35.145 --> 56:39.399
-No, it’s important to me.
You have to write it.

56:39.441 --> 56:40.775
People need to know

56:40.817 --> 56:42.402
that when something isn’t right
in their lives,

56:42.444 --> 56:43.945
they can change it.

56:43.987 --> 56:46.114
-To be honest,
I’m searching now

56:46.156 --> 56:49.451
for what it’s even
gonna be about.

56:49.492 --> 56:53.830
-I get it. It’s your piece,
it’s your decision, T.

56:53.872 --> 56:56.416
But think about it, please?

56:56.458 --> 56:58.126
-Ok.
-I gotta go.

57:09.471 --> 57:11.514
[sniffling]

57:12.807 --> 57:15.810
Laurel, hey.
What’s the matter?

57:17.270 --> 57:19.105
-Gluten free cupcakes.

57:19.147 --> 57:20.273
-What?

57:20.315 --> 57:22.025
-Yeah. There are no
gluten free cupcakes

57:22.067 --> 57:24.652
within a 200 mile radius
of our wedding site.

57:24.694 --> 57:26.488
-That’s too bad.

57:26.529 --> 57:27.906
-My sister is gluten intolerant

57:27.947 --> 57:29.240
and now she won't have
any cupcakes

57:29.282 --> 57:30.492
to eat at the reception.

57:34.245 --> 57:39.125
-I suspect it's not the cupcakes
you’re really upset about?

57:39.167 --> 57:42.462
-No. I just can’t believe
Sean left me here

57:42.504 --> 57:44.839
to plan our entire wedding
because he’s incapable

57:44.881 --> 57:47.217
of saying no to anything
his boss demands.

57:49.344 --> 57:51.805
-You know, I think that
you've been really amazing,

57:51.846 --> 57:53.556
taking all of this on
on your own.

57:57.018 --> 58:00.105
-Is this what the future
is gonna be like?

58:01.064 --> 58:05.068
Me holding down the fort while
Sean runs off whenever he wants?

58:05.110 --> 58:06.861
-I’m sure this is an exception.

58:06.903 --> 58:08.196
-I don’t know.

58:10.365 --> 58:13.326
You know, maybe...

58:13.368 --> 58:16.204
Maybe Rod and Michelle
have the right idea.

58:17.038 --> 58:20.333
Maybe this is just a terrible
time to get married.

58:21.418 --> 58:23.712
-I’m leaving you this message
as your best friend.

58:23.753 --> 58:25.839
You need to call Laurel
as soon as you get this.

58:25.880 --> 58:27.465
I love you, but you have left
her to deal with

58:27.507 --> 58:29.884
this entire wedding by herself
and she is at a breaking point,

58:29.926 --> 58:31.219
so call her!

58:33.388 --> 58:34.389
[sighs]

58:38.476 --> 58:41.688
Is it wrong of me to say
that I love my friends,

58:41.730 --> 58:44.274
but right now they are
driving me so crazy

58:44.315 --> 58:47.027
that I wouldn’t be sorry
if I didn’t see them again

58:47.068 --> 58:50.447
until our 25th high
school reunion?

58:50.488 --> 58:55.577
-Well, I have the perfect
solution for you.

58:55.618 --> 58:57.162
-What’s that?

58:58.163 --> 59:13.053

59:13.094 --> 59:22.896

59:22.937 --> 59:24.356
-[Ryan] You seeing
what I’m seeing?

59:24.397 --> 59:25.398
-I'm sorry.

59:27.567 --> 59:29.569
-It seems like we’re the object
of some interest.

59:29.611 --> 59:30.612
-Mmhm.

59:32.322 --> 59:34.532
Should we give them
something to talk about.

59:36.284 --> 59:43.792
* In the Heat of the night... *

59:43.833 --> 59:50.924
* Watching the...
sittin' here thinking *

59:50.965 --> 59:52.342
-This is what I’ve been missing.

59:53.802 --> 59:55.303
-What do you mean?

59:58.473 --> 01:00:04.813
-It’s not me trotting off
to some foreign country, it's...

01:00:04.854 --> 01:00:08.274
I’m missing being with family.

01:00:08.316 --> 01:00:11.069
Celebrating.

01:00:11.111 --> 01:00:14.447
I’m missing being with friends.

01:00:14.489 --> 01:00:19.160
*

01:00:19.202 --> 01:00:24.624
* Nothing to do,
sit here waiting for you *

01:00:24.666 --> 01:00:26.292
-It’s happening!

01:00:26.334 --> 01:00:27.794
-Oh yeah.

01:00:27.836 --> 01:00:33.383
*

[cell phone chimes]

01:01:28.980 --> 01:01:31.649
-And that’s why it’s just
not working out

01:01:31.691 --> 01:01:37.238
and why, unfortunately, I don’t
think I can finish the feature.

01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:38.156
-No.

01:01:38.615 --> 01:01:39.366
-What?

01:01:39.407 --> 01:01:40.867
-I said the answer is no.

01:01:40.909 --> 01:01:42.202
I don’t hand out
feature articles

01:01:42.243 --> 01:01:43.870
like Halloween candy, Trish.

01:01:43.912 --> 01:01:45.205
You’re lucky to get one.

01:01:45.246 --> 01:01:47.374
So, you’re still writing
the piece.

01:01:49.709 --> 01:01:56.007
-I uh, I... Helen, I can’t.
I just can’t.

01:01:56.049 --> 01:01:58.343
I have no idea
what the angle is,

01:01:58.385 --> 01:02:00.720
there aren’t even
three weddings anymore.

01:02:00.762 --> 01:02:02.931
Some people might not even speak
to me again if I do this.

01:02:02.972 --> 01:02:04.474
I really...

01:02:04.516 --> 01:02:06.893
-Didn’t you tell me you wanted
to write personal stories?

01:02:06.935 --> 01:02:08.436
Important stories?

01:02:08.478 --> 01:02:09.854
-Yes.

01:02:09.896 --> 01:02:13.274
-It’s easy to write 200 words
on nail polish, Trish.

01:02:13.316 --> 01:02:17.654
This, what you said you wanted
to do, it’s hard.

01:02:17.696 --> 01:02:19.656
And the hard part comes when
it doesn’t go exactly the way

01:02:19.698 --> 01:02:22.033
you thought it would
and you have to adapt.

01:02:22.075 --> 01:02:23.118
Like now.

01:02:23.159 --> 01:02:25.829
You have an assignment,
close it out.

01:02:25.870 --> 01:02:26.955
-But...

-Ah, back to the motorcycle
are we?

01:02:33.003 --> 01:02:34.421
-Don’t act like
you’re not impressed.

01:02:34.462 --> 01:02:36.297
-You just like that I have
to hang onto you.

01:02:36.339 --> 01:02:37.340
-Hm.

01:02:37.382 --> 01:02:39.217
-Love what this does to my hair.

01:02:41.344 --> 01:02:42.345
-Uh-huh.

-You’re lying,
but that’s sweet.

01:03:03.366 --> 01:03:06.870
Excuse me, a moment, I need to
have a word with your brother.

01:03:13.543 --> 01:03:17.464
-Gonna find a place to change.
Don’t worry, I’ll ask someone.

01:03:21.968 --> 01:03:23.845
-Hey. Did you get
my messages?

01:03:23.887 --> 01:03:25.347
I also sent you nine texts.

01:03:25.388 --> 01:03:28.558
-I got them, yes, and I thought
they were perfectly calm.

01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:30.852
-Don’t mock me.
You are in the soup.

01:03:30.894 --> 01:03:32.103
Have you talked to her?

01:03:32.145 --> 01:03:33.688
-Of course.

01:03:33.730 --> 01:03:36.483
I called her as soon as
I got your messages

01:03:36.524 --> 01:03:38.651
and I changed my flights
and came back right away.

01:03:38.693 --> 01:03:40.445
-I just don’t understand
how you could have left her

01:03:40.487 --> 01:03:42.447
to take care of all this
on her own.

01:03:42.489 --> 01:03:44.574
-Well I had to work, Trish.

01:03:44.616 --> 01:03:45.867
And because I did,

01:03:45.909 --> 01:03:48.328
now we're able to go away
for an entire month.

01:03:48.370 --> 01:03:50.997
-This is why I’m skeptical
of all this marriage stuff.

01:03:51.039 --> 01:03:54.668
-Why? So you’ll never have
to deal with pain or problems?

01:03:54.709 --> 01:03:57.045
-Yes, exactly.

01:03:57.087 --> 01:03:59.255
-Well, they get you anyway,

01:03:59.297 --> 01:04:02.634
and when they do there’s
only one way through it.

01:04:04.010 --> 01:04:05.095
-What’s that?

01:04:05.136 --> 01:04:07.013
-Forgiveness.

01:04:07.055 --> 01:04:10.100
I told Laurel that
I let her down

01:04:10.141 --> 01:04:12.602
and I apologized
and she forgave me.

01:04:12.644 --> 01:04:15.313
It didn’t happen easily
or right away,

01:04:15.355 --> 01:04:19.317
but she forgave me
because that’s who she is.

01:04:19.359 --> 01:04:21.778
And that’s why I love her.

01:04:24.239 --> 01:04:26.783
Come on, we have a wedding
to celebrate.

01:04:45.218 --> 01:04:46.219
-Can I sit?

01:04:46.261 --> 01:04:47.762
-Yeah, sure.

01:04:54.144 --> 01:04:55.770
-How are you doing?

01:04:55.812 --> 01:04:56.980
-Alright.

01:04:58.189 --> 01:05:01.484
It's a trip, this whole crazy
wedding season.

01:05:03.486 --> 01:05:06.072
-Don’t tell me you’re actually
trying to work right now.

01:05:06.114 --> 01:05:07.323
In the middle of a party?

01:05:07.365 --> 01:05:09.576
-If I don’t write my ideas down
I forget them.

01:05:10.410 --> 01:05:11.995
-Well, I’ve got an idea.

01:05:15.957 --> 01:05:17.208
Come with me.

01:05:17.709 --> 01:05:19.336
Put that thing away,
let’s go, come on.

01:05:22.922 --> 01:05:25.258
Come on.
Let’s go.

01:05:25.300 --> 01:05:26.885
Come on.
Follow me.

01:05:27.469 --> 01:05:29.512
-I am intrigued.
Where are we going?

01:05:31.181 --> 01:05:33.224
-You've been running around
for the brides

01:05:33.266 --> 01:05:37.395
and then trying to write
in your down time.

01:05:37.437 --> 01:05:39.189
I know you love the water,

01:05:39.230 --> 01:05:41.316
but have you even
really seen it yet?

01:05:41.358 --> 01:05:43.318
-You mean this lake
right here?

01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:44.819
-The very one.

01:05:44.861 --> 01:05:46.154
-Well I’m seeing it now.

01:05:46.196 --> 01:05:47.364

the perfect moment on the dock

the other night.

-You think this moment
might be a bit better?

01:06:51.636 --> 01:06:54.639

might be a lot better.

I understand.

-Hm?

01:07:23.209 --> 01:07:24.586
-June.
-What?

01:07:26.087 --> 01:07:27.589
-Look.

-What's up?

01:07:47.484 --> 01:07:51.112

-The word?

-Yeah.

01:07:58.912 --> 01:07:59.996
-What?

01:08:01.456 --> 01:08:02.874
-Just... just timing sucks.

01:08:04.668 --> 01:08:06.002
In order for me to make
the flight

01:08:06.044 --> 01:08:08.296
I’d have to be on the 5:00pm
ferry out tomorrow.

01:08:08.338 --> 01:08:09.923
-Tomorrow as in...

01:08:09.964 --> 01:08:12.509
-Any time after the ceremony
but before the reception.

01:08:13.927 --> 01:08:15.637
Just say the word
and I’ll turn it down.

01:08:15.679 --> 01:08:17.055
-No!

01:08:17.097 --> 01:08:19.683
No, no, no, brother.
That’s not my decision to make.

01:08:20.016 --> 01:08:22.560
After all these years of you
talking about this trip,

01:08:22.602 --> 01:08:25.146
I'm not gonna be the reason
you give it up.

01:08:25.188 --> 01:08:28.483
-I didn’t mean for you to make
the decision for me.

01:08:28.525 --> 01:08:34.072
I just... I just wonder
if there’s another... way.

01:08:34.114 --> 01:08:36.658
-You know, maybe
it’s best if you do go.

01:08:37.283 --> 01:08:39.744
Now, rather than later.

01:08:41.496 --> 01:08:43.081

-Uh, I mean...

01:08:48.461 --> 01:08:52.716
You can’t toy
with Trish, ok?

01:08:52.757 --> 01:08:54.175
She’s my best friend

01:08:54.217 --> 01:08:58.555
and she’s always gonna be
a part of my life,

01:08:58.596 --> 01:09:01.850
so, if you want
to be with her,

01:09:01.891 --> 01:09:03.643
you need to be very sure
that’s what you want

01:09:03.685 --> 01:09:05.562
and tell her exactly
how you feel.

since you we got back
from the beach.

01:09:31.087 --> 01:09:34.591
I feel like I’ve finally made
this breakthrough.

01:09:37.093 --> 01:09:38.678
Is everything ok?

01:09:40.513 --> 01:09:46.227
-So, this is one of
the hardest things

01:09:46.269 --> 01:09:48.980
I've had to do
in a long time.

01:09:49.022 --> 01:09:50.940
-What is it?
What’s going on?

01:09:58.281 --> 01:10:00.075
-I’m leaving tomorrow.

01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:04.120
-What do you mean, leaving?

01:10:06.581 --> 01:10:08.958
-I got the call about
the southern lights trip.

01:10:12.337 --> 01:10:16.549
-So you’re gonna miss
your own brother’s wedding?

01:10:17.342 --> 01:10:21.805
-I’ll be there for the ceremony
but not the reception.

01:10:21.846 --> 01:10:23.932
-And Sean’s okay with that?

01:10:23.973 --> 01:10:27.018
-I mean, he’s not crazy
about it

01:10:28.812 --> 01:10:32.065
but he knows it's been
a long-time dream of mine

01:10:32.107 --> 01:10:34.984
and it’s obviously an
opportunity I can’t pass up.

01:10:37.821 --> 01:10:39.239
-You’ve gotta do it.

01:10:41.324 --> 01:10:42.826
-Really?

01:10:44.244 --> 01:10:46.496
I wasn’t expecting the timing
of this to be so bad.

01:10:46.538 --> 01:10:51.668
-Yeah, but you know,
it’s the one thing

01:10:51.710 --> 01:10:55.797
that you've always wanted
to photograph.

01:10:55.839 --> 01:10:57.173
You have no choice.

01:10:57.215 --> 01:10:59.843
You’ve gotta grab
that opportunity.

01:11:06.266 --> 01:11:07.350
-Hm.

01:11:08.685 --> 01:11:11.479
Would it be ok with you
if we tried things again

01:11:11.521 --> 01:11:12.856
when I get back?

01:11:23.616 --> 01:11:24.951
-No.

01:11:28.246 --> 01:11:29.706
-No?

01:11:32.208 --> 01:11:35.837
-No, Ryan. I’m sorry.

01:11:37.339 --> 01:11:40.967
You know, everything that’s
gone on these last few weeks

01:11:41.009 --> 01:11:46.890
with these weddings,
it’s... changed me.

01:11:46.931 --> 01:11:51.186
I don’t really know how
to explain it except that

01:11:51.227 --> 01:11:54.856
all the things that I used
to think were ridiculous

01:11:54.898 --> 01:12:01.446
and sentimental, they all seem
incredibly meaningful now.

01:12:02.906 --> 01:12:06.451
And I just, I guess I just
don’t want to live a life

01:12:06.493 --> 01:12:08.703
where I’m sad every few months

01:12:08.745 --> 01:12:11.414
cause it’s time for you
to leave again.

01:12:12.290 --> 01:12:14.501
I don’t want to resent you
for that.

01:12:17.337 --> 01:12:18.797
-I understand.

01:12:21.883 --> 01:12:23.885
-And, you know,
look at it this way.

01:12:23.927 --> 01:12:27.013
We’re both getting
what we said we wanted.

01:12:27.055 --> 01:12:28.682
You’re gonna photograph
that one thing

01:12:28.723 --> 01:12:30.809
you always wanted to shoot

01:12:30.850 --> 01:12:35.021
and I can finally call myself
a writer.

01:12:36.523 --> 01:12:40.151
So, we should be happy.

01:12:42.779 --> 01:12:45.865
-Yeah.
Yeah, we should.

01:12:50.203 --> 01:12:54.708
-Well, I should... I should
finish this up.

01:12:54.749 --> 01:12:56.126
Just, um...

01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:10.181
[melancholy music]

01:13:26.406 --> 01:13:29.367
[cheerful music]

01:13:36.374 --> 01:13:37.542
[exhales]

01:13:39.377 --> 01:13:43.006
As I look back on these
three weeks of celebration,

01:13:43.048 --> 01:13:44.841
the lesson I take with me

01:13:44.883 --> 01:13:48.845
is that every couple and
every wedding is as unique

01:13:48.887 --> 01:13:51.264
as the love story
that spawned it.

01:13:51.306 --> 01:13:55.268
And you have to trust
that eventually all heartbreak

01:13:55.310 --> 01:13:57.062
will lead to joy.

01:14:00.690 --> 01:14:03.943
[emotional music]

01:14:16.623 --> 01:14:19.918
[cheerful music]

01:14:22.462 --> 01:14:25.298
-You look beautiful.

01:14:25.340 --> 01:14:26.925
-Thank you.

01:14:29.594 --> 01:14:31.680
-Dear friends and family,

01:14:31.721 --> 01:14:37.310
we welcome you in celebrating
the marriage of Sean and Laurel.

01:14:37.352 --> 01:14:49.614
*

01:14:49.656 --> 01:14:51.616
[cheering and applause]

01:14:58.456 --> 01:15:03.211

01:15:04.045 --> 01:15:06.464
[indistinct conversations]

01:15:22.272 --> 01:15:25.150
-Trish! Look!
George proposed!

01:15:25.191 --> 01:15:26.443
Another wedding!
[laughing]

01:15:29.362 --> 01:15:32.615
-Wow.
Carrie, that’s wonderful.

01:15:32.657 --> 01:15:33.908
Congratulations, you guys.

01:15:33.950 --> 01:15:35.744
-Guess we caught the fever.

01:15:35.785 --> 01:15:38.329
-It really is the season.

01:15:38.371 --> 01:15:41.624
Wait, where’s your guy?
Where’s Ryan?

01:15:41.666 --> 01:15:43.418
-He had to leave.

01:15:43.460 --> 01:15:45.795
-He left his own brother’s
wedding reception?

01:15:45.837 --> 01:15:47.339
-Well, he had no choice.

01:15:47.380 --> 01:15:50.133
He was offered his dream job
so he had to go.

01:15:50.175 --> 01:15:52.635
-I don’t care if it was
his dream job or not.

01:15:52.677 --> 01:15:55.138
That must have hurt.

01:15:55.180 --> 01:15:57.766
-Well, I mean, these things
happen, you know.

01:15:57.807 --> 01:16:01.269
He's been waiting for years for
the opportunity to photograph...

01:16:03.355 --> 01:16:10.320
*

01:16:10.362 --> 01:16:11.363
What are you...

01:16:12.906 --> 01:16:14.824
You’re gonna miss your flight.

01:16:14.866 --> 01:16:16.701
-No, I’m not missing anything.

01:16:18.411 --> 01:16:20.538
Everything I’m missing
is right here.

01:16:23.416 --> 01:16:25.210
-[Announcer] Excuse me,
Ryan Peterson to the podium.

01:16:25.251 --> 01:16:26.961
Ryan Peterson to the podium.

01:16:27.003 --> 01:16:29.255
-They’re calling for you.
At the front, Ryan.

01:16:29.297 --> 01:16:30.423
-Oh, yeah.

01:16:30.465 --> 01:16:32.092
[laughs]

01:16:39.182 --> 01:16:40.809
-Words are not really
my strength,

01:16:40.850 --> 01:16:43.937
so that’s why I thought I’d tell
Laurel and Sean’s story

01:16:43.978 --> 01:16:45.772
through pictures.

01:16:48.108 --> 01:16:53.863
Sean only reached the highest
of his full potential

01:16:53.905 --> 01:16:56.741
after he met his other half.

01:16:56.783 --> 01:16:58.326
Now, I do have to say one thing,

01:16:58.368 --> 01:17:01.955
even though I am the big
brother, I uh,

01:17:01.996 --> 01:17:04.207
I have to admit that

01:17:04.249 --> 01:17:08.211
Sean understood something
long before I did.

01:17:08.253 --> 01:17:11.381
He understood that peak
experiences are best

01:17:11.423 --> 01:17:15.385
when shared with someone
you love.

01:17:15.427 --> 01:17:20.306
Someone who reminds you
to play to your strengths

01:17:20.348 --> 01:17:25.353
and makes you the best possible
version of yourself.

01:17:25.395 --> 01:17:28.398
And the kind of home that you'd
be excited to come back to,

01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:31.192
or better yet, never leave
in the first place.

01:17:32.694 --> 01:17:34.320
So...

01:17:36.156 --> 01:17:38.616
to Laurel and Sean.

01:17:38.658 --> 01:17:40.201
Cheers.

01:17:40.243 --> 01:17:43.246
[cheering and applause]

01:17:43.288 --> 01:17:45.457
And now, to Sean’s best friend

01:17:45.498 --> 01:17:48.418
and a very special member of our
family is gonna say a few words.

01:17:48.460 --> 01:17:51.379
[applause]

01:17:53.965 --> 01:17:56.009
-You're a tough act to follow.

01:17:56.051 --> 01:17:57.469
-You have nothing
to worry about.

01:17:57.510 --> 01:17:59.220
You got this, ok?

01:18:08.104 --> 01:18:10.106
-So, as many of you know,

01:18:10.148 --> 01:18:12.859
I have been writing my first
magazine article

01:18:12.901 --> 01:18:17.447
about this crazy wedding season
we’ve all been living through.

01:18:17.489 --> 01:18:21.743
And it’s given me a chance
to reflect on what I’ve learned

01:18:21.785 --> 01:18:23.453
from each of these couples

01:18:23.495 --> 01:18:27.916
that I’ve been lucky
to see up close.

01:18:27.957 --> 01:18:30.293
So, here it goes.

01:18:30.335 --> 01:18:33.296
First thing I’ve learned
is that you have to cherish

01:18:33.338 --> 01:18:36.341
what’s unique
about your partner.

01:18:36.383 --> 01:18:40.887
It’s those, those little rituals
that only the two of you share.

01:18:42.472 --> 01:18:46.309
You know, we all go through
this life feeling the same way,

01:18:46.351 --> 01:18:52.190
awkward, maybe even
a little misshapen.

01:18:52.232 --> 01:18:55.276
Sort of the way that jigsaw
puzzle pieces are

01:18:55.318 --> 01:18:58.613
and like a jigsaw puzzle piece,

01:18:58.655 --> 01:19:03.702
when you meet that person
who fits perfectly with you,

01:19:03.743 --> 01:19:06.996
you make a truly beautiful
picture together.

01:19:07.038 --> 01:19:08.164
Like Peter and June.

01:19:08.206 --> 01:19:09.833
-We cherish you, Trish!

01:19:09.874 --> 01:19:11.584
[laughter]

01:19:15.505 --> 01:19:20.343
-Now, the second lesson
is that you must truly
know yourself in life

01:19:20.385 --> 01:19:24.222
before you can ever hope
to make another person happy.

01:19:24.264 --> 01:19:27.058
So, if marriage is a union
of two people,

01:19:27.100 --> 01:19:31.312
it has to be a union who feel
complete within themselves.

01:19:31.354 --> 01:19:34.441
And if you don’t have that,

01:19:34.482 --> 01:19:35.859
then you need to find
the courage

01:19:35.900 --> 01:19:38.194
to call a halt to things.

01:19:38.236 --> 01:19:40.613
No matter how hard that may be.

01:19:42.323 --> 01:19:44.743
But Sean and Laurel

01:19:44.784 --> 01:19:48.038
taught me the most important
lesson of all.

01:19:48.079 --> 01:19:48.913
Forgiveness.

01:19:51.291 --> 01:19:52.625
If we’re gonna make our way
through this life

01:19:52.667 --> 01:19:57.047
with the person we love,
we must forgive.

01:19:57.088 --> 01:20:00.342
Each and every one of us
is flawed, right?

01:20:00.383 --> 01:20:02.886
And though we may hurt
one another,

01:20:02.927 --> 01:20:05.347
sometimes even deeply,

01:20:05.388 --> 01:20:10.226
we all deserve a chance
to earn back trust and respect.

01:20:10.268 --> 01:20:12.354
We all deserve a chance
at love.

01:20:13.480 --> 01:20:14.606
We do.

01:20:16.566 --> 01:20:19.694
I learned those lessons
from the couples here tonight.

01:20:19.736 --> 01:20:30.872
And it's due to each of them
that I feel ready, maybe,

01:20:30.914 --> 01:20:36.795
for the first time to take
a risk and be in love.

01:20:41.633 --> 01:20:44.386
So, thank you.

01:20:45.345 --> 01:20:49.432
Now, everyone please raise
a glass to Sean and Laurel

01:20:49.474 --> 01:20:51.601
and their love story.

01:20:51.643 --> 01:20:57.649
To Sean and Laurel, Peter
and June, Michelle and Rod.

01:20:57.691 --> 01:20:59.734
Congratulations, guys.
I love you.

01:20:59.776 --> 01:21:02.362
[cheers and applause]

01:21:07.075 --> 01:21:11.454

01:21:11.496 --> 01:21:14.165
* I'm in for the long run *

01:21:14.207 --> 01:21:17.877
* Don't ever want to be done *

* I'm all in, all in *

and I'm coming undone *

* I'm falling, falling... *

01:21:35.228 --> 01:21:37.147
* For you *

01:21:37.188 --> 01:21:38.523
-Looks like my brother

01:21:38.565 --> 01:21:41.484
chose to chase a different
dream this time.

01:21:41.526 --> 01:21:43.445
-Yeah, not sure how I’m gonna
compete with

01:21:43.486 --> 01:21:45.947
a bunch of mystical lights
to be honest. [laughs]

01:21:45.989 --> 01:21:47.574
-Come on, Trish.

01:21:47.615 --> 01:21:49.868
You’ve always shone brighter
than you thought.

01:21:50.618 --> 01:21:53.079
*

01:21:53.121 --> 01:21:58.001
* ...and take me for a ride
I'm right behind you *

01:21:58.043 --> 01:22:00.920
*

01:22:00.962 --> 01:22:06.468
-Thank you for taking
a chance and staying.

01:22:06.509 --> 01:22:09.596
-Well, you were the one
that made me realize

01:22:09.637 --> 01:22:13.683
that I'd be an idiot
if I left, so...

01:22:13.725 --> 01:22:18.480
-And you made me realize what I
didn’t even know I was missing.

01:22:18.521 --> 01:22:24.361
*

01:22:24.402 --> 01:22:28.531
* ... I'll follow blindly *

01:22:28.573 --> 01:22:34.120
* And take me for a ride
I'm right behind you *

01:22:34.162 --> 01:22:39.918
* If you ever want to stay
then I'll be with you *

01:22:39.959 --> 01:22:45.757
*

01:22:47.676 --> 01:22:49.219

-You guys, I heard back!

01:22:58.103 --> 01:23:00.397
Our story is gonna be the lead
feature for August.

01:23:00.438 --> 01:23:03.149
I’m gonna be a published writer
thanks to you.
