00:01.001 --> 00:02.961
[narrator] <i>Previously on </i>The Blacklist:

00:03.044 --> 00:05.130
[Townsend] We'll intercept the signal
when you turn it on.

00:05.213 --> 00:09.509
They're coming toward us.
Fast, like, impossibly fast.

00:11.636 --> 00:13.221
[Dembe] Twenty minutes to Riga.

00:13.304 --> 00:14.639
We're going to Latvia?

00:14.723 --> 00:16.558
-For what?
-For answers.

00:17.142 --> 00:18.268
[Liz] What is this place?

00:18.351 --> 00:20.895
[Raymond]
Baltic's best seafood distributor.

00:20.979 --> 00:23.273
[Liz] Why do I feel like
that's not at all what this is?

00:23.356 --> 00:26.484
Because that's not at all
what this is. It's a front.

00:27.402 --> 00:31.573
I brought you here because this is
where it all started. The epicenter.

00:31.656 --> 00:33.158
You are N-13.

00:33.742 --> 00:34.659
Yes.

00:34.743 --> 00:39.914
The Sikorsky Archive was a seed,
the beginning of what would become

00:39.998 --> 00:44.586
one of the most sophisticated
intelligence networks in existence.

00:44.669 --> 00:50.216
This place is part of a machine
that is and has been my life's work

00:50.300 --> 00:51.968
for the past three decades.

00:54.095 --> 00:55.805
This is the Blacklist.

01:00.143 --> 01:02.145
[suspenseful music playing]

01:07.901 --> 01:11.404
This? This is where they come up
with the Blacklist?

01:12.155 --> 01:13.573
It's not that literal.

01:14.240 --> 01:19.329
But this is where intelligence
from 17 outposts around the world

01:19.412 --> 01:21.915
is gathered, sorted and analyzed.

01:21.998 --> 01:22.874
Intel.

01:23.333 --> 01:30.173
Leaked documents, intercepted communiqués,
secrets from governments, corporations,

01:30.256 --> 01:32.550
people in positions of power.

01:32.634 --> 01:36.387
-You're sourcing intelligence.
-I'm printing currency.

01:36.471 --> 01:38.389
And the Sikorsky Archive,

01:38.973 --> 01:42.435
that's how this all began,
13 packets of intel?

01:42.519 --> 01:46.231
Thirteen packets that were traded,
leveraged,

01:46.314 --> 01:49.776
sometimes sold
in an effort to acquire more.

01:49.859 --> 01:53.905
More information,
more protection, more authority.

01:54.489 --> 01:58.743
The system is a living,
breathing apparatus

01:58.827 --> 02:01.913
that powers many of the decisions I make.

02:01.996 --> 02:04.165
And it's all analog?

02:04.249 --> 02:05.333
[chuckles] Oh, no.

02:05.416 --> 02:07.919
We have gigantic computers elsewhere,

02:08.002 --> 02:11.965
but around here, they allow me
to believe it's completely analog.

02:12.048 --> 02:16.803
-Digital footprints make me jittery.
-And what happens to this information?

02:16.886 --> 02:18.096
It's sent to me.

02:18.680 --> 02:21.766
Wrapped, packed
and smuggled into New York Harbor.

02:23.768 --> 02:24.602
Yes.

02:26.104 --> 02:26.938
Okay.

02:27.689 --> 02:29.274
Thank you for the tour.

02:29.357 --> 02:30.483
But why am I here?

02:30.567 --> 02:32.193
I brought you here because,

02:32.277 --> 02:35.196
despite what you
and Harold have come to believe,

02:35.280 --> 02:37.115
I am not a Russian asset.

02:37.907 --> 02:38.825
I'm a criminal.

02:39.826 --> 02:43.705
And Ivan Stepanov is not
my Russian handler.

02:43.788 --> 02:45.498
He's just an old friend.

02:46.082 --> 02:49.878
In fact, I definitely handle him more
than he would ever be able to handle me.

02:50.962 --> 02:52.672
I'm Raymond Reddington.

02:53.256 --> 02:55.717
This is Raymond Reddington.

02:56.467 --> 03:01.598
And you need to see what one day
will be yours, to learn how it works.

03:01.681 --> 03:02.557
I'm not interested.

03:02.640 --> 03:06.644
You need to understand
the infrastructure, how we cull data,

03:06.728 --> 03:09.022
meet the analysts
who make this all possible.

03:09.105 --> 03:12.025
The only thing I'm interested in
is my mother.

03:12.859 --> 03:16.112
-You said you didn't kill her, but I saw--
-You don't know what you saw.

03:16.195 --> 03:18.448
[Liz] <i>I saw you shoot her.</i>
<i>You murdered her.</i>

03:18.990 --> 03:20.617
Elizabeth, stop.

03:22.535 --> 03:24.913
[audio slows, then echoes]

03:31.753 --> 03:34.464
Forget about everything
you think you know.

03:35.340 --> 03:40.553
Right now,
there is only you and me and the truth.

03:41.512 --> 03:42.347
What did you say?

03:42.430 --> 03:45.975
[Raymond] The story you need to hear.
It's all connected.

03:46.809 --> 03:51.940
N-13, the Fulcrum, you, me.

03:52.649 --> 03:54.108
-Your mother.
-[Katarina] <i>Your mother.</i>

03:54.192 --> 03:55.401
What about my mother?

03:55.485 --> 03:58.696
To understand why I came into your life...

03:58.780 --> 04:00.823
[Katarina] <i>You need to hear my story.</i>

04:03.618 --> 04:05.495
<i>The truth about who I was.</i>

04:06.162 --> 04:07.205
<i>Who you are.</i>

04:08.456 --> 04:10.458
[dramatic music playing]

04:12.377 --> 04:13.711
The truth is, Masha...

04:17.298 --> 04:19.926
is that you were conceived
as part of a lie.

04:21.219 --> 04:23.012
But it shouldn't surprise you.

04:24.138 --> 04:26.432
I was born into a world of spies.

04:28.518 --> 04:30.228
Becoming one was my destiny.

04:31.396 --> 04:35.858
<i>I grew up in a system that monitored</i>
<i>subversion, snuffed out dissidents.</i>

04:36.359 --> 04:39.320
<i>My father was not only part</i>
<i>of that system, he helped to build it.</i>

04:39.404 --> 04:41.406
[speaking in Russian]

04:42.782 --> 04:46.035
<i>And because I was the son</i>
<i>my father never had,</i>

04:46.619 --> 04:49.831
<i>he decided early on</i>
<i>that I'd follow in those footsteps,</i>

04:50.873 --> 04:52.750
<i>which my mother disapproved of.</i>

04:55.586 --> 04:57.171
<i>My mother understood me.</i>

04:57.672 --> 05:00.842
<i>She knew I wanted</i>
<i>to follow a different path...</i>

05:00.925 --> 05:02.635
<i>but my father was unyielding.</i>

05:03.303 --> 05:04.762
<i>He scripted my life.</i>

05:05.263 --> 05:07.181
<i>He observed and scrutinized it.</i>

05:08.141 --> 05:09.976
<i>Even before I could understand,</i>

05:10.059 --> 05:13.479
<i>I was helping the Fifth Directorate</i>
<i>carry out operations.</i>

05:14.063 --> 05:17.859
<i>I helped move intelligence,</i>
<i>monitor dissidents,</i>

05:18.359 --> 05:21.821
<i>identify those</i>
<i>the state thought to be subversives.</i>

05:22.322 --> 05:24.282
<i>The work was literally in my DNA.</i>

05:30.038 --> 05:34.000
<i>My handler, the one chosen by my father,</i>

05:34.834 --> 05:37.211
<i>he understood me in ways others did not.</i>

05:41.841 --> 05:46.345
<i>In fact, he would eventually become</i>
<i>one of the most important men in my life.</i>

05:47.847 --> 05:49.974
-Ivan Stepanov.
-Yes.

05:51.726 --> 05:56.022
But truth be told,
the assignments Ivan Stepanov gave me

05:56.105 --> 05:59.317
were all based on
what my father wanted, needed.

06:00.985 --> 06:04.697
Friends, relationships, men, women.

06:05.406 --> 06:07.909
My father even handpicked my husband.

06:08.451 --> 06:09.827
Constantin Rostov.

06:10.620 --> 06:13.831
In order to benefit
from the advantages he provided.

06:13.915 --> 06:17.460
<i>My father could care less</i>
<i>that I was in a loveless marriage.</i>

06:17.543 --> 06:21.506
He even chose the man with whom
I was unfaithful to my husband.

06:22.090 --> 06:23.007
My father.

06:26.010 --> 06:30.014
[Stepanov] He's an American,
stationed at the embassy in Moscow.

06:30.098 --> 06:34.143
The director believes
he could be... useful.

06:36.062 --> 06:37.105
[Reddington] <i>Hello, sweetheart.</i>

06:37.188 --> 06:39.190
[suspenseful music playing]

06:42.610 --> 06:45.488
-You don't remember me.
-[Liz] I do.

06:47.031 --> 06:48.366
You're my father.

06:50.076 --> 06:51.786
I remember your face.

06:57.834 --> 06:59.794
-[in Russian] Hey, wait.
-[in Russian] Sorry. Too late.

06:59.877 --> 07:01.879
You knew I was going to take that.

07:03.089 --> 07:05.424
You have cheese. Be happy.

07:06.342 --> 07:08.553
What if I trade you the cheese
for the bread?

07:10.346 --> 07:11.514
[in English] You're American.

07:12.890 --> 07:14.517
[Reddington in English]
<i>I should have known better.</i>

07:15.101 --> 07:17.687
<i>But your mother, she was good.</i>

07:18.688 --> 07:20.356
<i>She told me about herself...</i>

07:21.065 --> 07:23.985
<i>that she was a production manager</i>
<i>with the Bolshoi Ballet,</i>

07:24.068 --> 07:25.778
<i>that she was in a bad marriage,</i>

07:25.862 --> 07:29.073
that her mother had moved to America
after her parents divorced.

07:29.157 --> 07:31.868
She was trying to get by
in a Russia that was falling apart.

07:33.786 --> 07:36.164
-They were all lies.
-[Katarina] Not all of them.

07:37.832 --> 07:38.833
Most of them.

07:40.293 --> 07:41.711
And you had a family.

07:41.794 --> 07:42.628
Yeah.

07:42.712 --> 07:43.588
Yes. I--

07:44.839 --> 07:46.632
My wife Carla was at home.

07:49.260 --> 07:51.762
-We had a baby girl.
-Jennifer.

07:51.846 --> 07:55.141
[Reddington] It was a mistake.
I should have seen it.

07:55.725 --> 07:57.143
I started to see it.

07:59.353 --> 08:02.523
-And that's when it happened.
-What happened?

08:02.607 --> 08:04.233
-You did.
-You did.

08:05.318 --> 08:07.945
I suppose, in some ways,
it's an opportunity.

08:09.238 --> 08:11.532
It's not an opportunity, Ivan.

08:11.616 --> 08:14.744
It's a baby. This is a problem.

08:17.997 --> 08:21.334
-Let me speak with your father again.
-There's no point.

08:22.877 --> 08:24.295
He's made up his mind.

08:26.130 --> 08:29.008
He says a child
will keep Reddington invested.

08:34.555 --> 08:37.475
Oh, my God,
what am I gonna tell Constantin?

08:41.145 --> 08:43.105
Tell him it's his.

08:44.524 --> 08:45.733
He'll be happy.

08:47.235 --> 08:49.028
[Katarina] <i>And so I did what I do.</i>

08:49.695 --> 08:50.780
<i>I lied.</i>

08:50.863 --> 08:54.116
<i>I told my husband</i>
<i>I was pregnant with his child.</i>

08:54.617 --> 08:57.245
<i>I told my mark</i>
<i>I was pregnant with his child.</i>

08:57.328 --> 08:58.621
[Reddington] <i>I was home on leave.</i>

08:58.704 --> 09:02.124
Katarina was in the U.S. while
supposedly traveling with the Bolshoi.

09:02.208 --> 09:04.502
-[Reddington] This is what I want!
-You're married.

09:04.585 --> 09:06.295
-I'll leave her.
-You have a child!

09:06.379 --> 09:09.090
-Now I'll have another.
-What are you talking about?

09:09.173 --> 09:12.426
This baby will destroy your family
and your career.

09:12.510 --> 09:14.845
I don't wanna be responsible for that.

09:14.929 --> 09:15.763
Katarina.

09:17.098 --> 09:18.182
She's my daughter.

09:20.309 --> 09:21.936
<i>So she took you from me.</i>

09:23.312 --> 09:26.232
She let another man believe
you were his daughter.

09:27.525 --> 09:28.442
<i>What's worse...</i>

09:29.944 --> 09:31.529
I couldn't even be there.

09:33.447 --> 09:34.282
Be where?

09:35.366 --> 09:36.617
[Katarina] <i>That day...</i>

09:37.660 --> 09:41.205
<i>seeing you,</i>
<i>I'd never felt anything like it.</i>

09:41.998 --> 09:45.585
<i>I had spent my entire life</i>
<i>lying and pretending.</i>

09:46.210 --> 09:49.463
<i>But you, you were</i>
<i>the first real thing in my life.</i>

09:50.464 --> 09:53.843
<i>So I vowed that I would do</i>
<i>whatever it would take</i>

09:54.594 --> 09:55.761
<i>to protect that.</i>

09:56.262 --> 09:57.096
Masha.

09:57.680 --> 09:58.764
<i>To protect you.</i>

10:12.612 --> 10:17.742
The next two years were a blur of lies.
I was married to a man I didn't love.

10:17.825 --> 10:21.078
I had a child with the man
I was targeting as a spy.

10:21.162 --> 10:22.830
My husband believed the baby was his.

10:22.913 --> 10:25.458
My lover had no idea he was a mark.

10:25.541 --> 10:27.460
We'd see each other when we could. Paris.

10:27.543 --> 10:28.586
-Moscow.
-London.

10:28.669 --> 10:29.837
-St. Petersburg.
-Berlin.

10:29.920 --> 10:32.548
By then, I had lost any sense of myself.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.467
I was living a lie.

10:34.550 --> 10:36.844
Everything about me was pretend.

10:38.095 --> 10:42.558
-And your wife, she never knew?
-There were some close calls.

10:42.642 --> 10:46.145
I even helped watch Jennifer one weekend
while she was away.

10:47.480 --> 10:50.191
<i>It was extremely uncomfortable,</i>
<i>playing house.</i>

10:51.192 --> 10:53.069
<i>It was becoming unbearable.</i>

10:54.195 --> 10:56.989
<i>There was a relentless demand</i>
<i>for more intel.</i>

10:58.532 --> 11:00.159
[Reddington] <i>It was a strange double life,</i>

11:01.327 --> 11:04.455
which was why it took me so long
to figure out that it wasn't real.

11:05.623 --> 11:07.083
But you did figure it out.

11:07.166 --> 11:09.043
[Reddington] I know
the company is leaving tomorrow,

11:09.126 --> 11:11.921
but can't you tell them
you'll stay behind to see your mother?

11:12.004 --> 11:15.758
-I would but your wife gets home tomorrow.
-We could made that work.

11:15.841 --> 11:17.426
We've done it before.

11:17.510 --> 11:21.722
If you leave now, I won't see you
until I'm back in the embassy on the 15th.

11:30.231 --> 11:33.734
I have to wake Masha.
If I don't, she'll be up all night.

12:01.554 --> 12:02.680
[Raymond] Elizabeth.

12:04.056 --> 12:05.391
Stay with the story.

12:10.729 --> 12:11.939
Stay with the story.

12:15.484 --> 12:17.486
[suspenseful music playing]

12:23.701 --> 12:26.036
He knew she was lying to him.

12:26.829 --> 12:29.707
[Reddington] I knew in that moment
that she was a plant,

12:29.790 --> 12:31.709
that our relationship was a lie.

12:32.209 --> 12:35.421
I knew that I needed to report
the incident to my superior,

12:35.504 --> 12:37.339
but I also wanted to protect myself.

12:37.965 --> 12:41.260
I wanted to go to them with evidence.
So I kept seeing her.

12:41.927 --> 12:44.805
I assumed
I would confirm she was a KGB spy.

12:45.347 --> 12:47.099
So you can imagine my surprise

12:47.183 --> 12:49.685
when I realized
it was far worse than that.

12:50.728 --> 12:52.980
Everything about you is a lie.

12:54.106 --> 12:56.192
[Reddington]
It went on for nearly two years.

12:56.734 --> 12:59.737
<i>At first, I didn't understand</i>
<i>what I was seeing.</i>

13:00.237 --> 13:04.283
She was spying for the KGB,
but she was spying on the KGB,

13:04.366 --> 13:06.076
and the Americans and others.

13:06.660 --> 13:10.623
<i>I realized that Katarina was connected</i>
<i>to something much larger.</i>

13:11.624 --> 13:13.626
Some kind of global network.

13:14.919 --> 13:16.128
The Cabal.

13:17.254 --> 13:18.547
So I watched her.

13:19.131 --> 13:21.550
<i>I let her steal from me,</i>
<i>so I could steal from her.</i>

13:22.259 --> 13:25.930
And eventually I was able to prove
that she was connected to--

13:27.097 --> 13:32.144
I was able to prove the very existence
of a secret global conspiracy.

13:32.937 --> 13:36.148

13:40.611 --> 13:44.448

[Liz] <i>The Fulcrum.</i>

13:51.497 --> 13:53.707
We were looking for a Christmas tree.

13:53.791 --> 13:55.876
["Jingle All the Way" playing]

13:57.545 --> 13:59.797
You came and took me to the beach house.

14:00.381 --> 14:04.760
-Yes, but your mother, her people came--
-He knew we would come for you.

14:04.843 --> 14:09.848
Not just you, the Fulcrum,
and that's why she came with a team.

14:10.432 --> 14:12.601
Oh, you love Christmas? Well, I...

14:12.685 --> 14:14.728
[tires screech]

14:14.812 --> 14:17.940
How do you like it, Hopsy? Good or not?

14:20.776 --> 14:22.403
Honey, I need you to come with me.

14:22.486 --> 14:24.154
-What's wrong?
-Come with me.

Stay in here, sweetheart.

14:28.742 --> 14:29.785
No matter what happens,

14:29.869 --> 14:32.997
I need you to stay in here,
and not come out until I come and get you.

14:33.080 --> 14:34.456
You understand?

14:34.540 --> 14:35.416
Okay.

-Don't do this.

-Is she here?
-[Ilya speaking in Russian]

14:48.387 --> 14:50.014
-You're in trouble.
-Because of you.

14:50.097 --> 14:52.016
They'll kill you
if you don't give it back.

14:52.099 --> 14:54.101
-Where's my daughter?
-[Ilya speaks in Russian]

14:54.184 --> 14:55.936
-[Katarina] Masha--
-Get away from her.

14:56.812 --> 14:58.731
[Katarina speaks in Russian]

14:58.814 --> 15:00.983
It's okay, Masha.
Just tell me where it is.

15:01.066 --> 15:02.860
Masha, come here. It's okay.

15:02.943 --> 15:06.196
Do you know what will happen
if they find out what you've done?

15:06.280 --> 15:07.281
Give me my daughter.

15:07.364 --> 15:08.365
Are you hearing me?

15:08.449 --> 15:10.075
You're signing my death warrant.

15:10.159 --> 15:12.411
If you won't protect me, protect yourself.

15:12.494 --> 15:15.122
-What does that mean?
-You don't think we have assurances?

15:15.706 --> 15:17.583
What have you done?

15:17.666 --> 15:20.210
We've been gaining leverage
against you, Raymond.

but you gave to me.

15:27.301 --> 15:28.719
I didn't give you anything!

15:28.802 --> 15:31.972
Stop! You're hurting her!
You're hurting her!

15:32.056 --> 15:35.517
If you move forward with what you think
you know, no one will believe you.

15:35.601 --> 15:37.353
You'll be branded a traitor.

Get off her!

-Masha.

16:20.980 --> 16:21.814
[Katarina] Masha.

16:21.897 --> 16:24.733
[in Russian] Masha, turn around.
It's okay. He's going to be okay.

16:24.817 --> 16:27.695
-[in Russian] We can't find it.
-It's in there. Go back in.

16:27.778 --> 16:30.781
-There's too much fire.
-Go. Now. Go!

[Katarina in English] The men who worked
for me looked for the Fulcrum.

16:36.787 --> 16:38.414
But the fire, it spread too fast.

16:47.423 --> 16:50.551
We'd given up.
We were at the car, about to leave.

16:50.634 --> 16:53.387
-And that's when--
-I went back inside.

16:56.724 --> 16:57.850
Masha!

17:19.913 --> 17:22.416
The flames spread fast, the smoke...

17:42.269 --> 17:43.812
You were burned.

17:45.481 --> 17:46.899
We both were.

17:50.110 --> 17:52.321
The fighting, the gunshot...

17:53.530 --> 17:55.240
the death of your father...

17:56.825 --> 17:58.077
those flames...

17:59.995 --> 18:02.915
I was desperate
to erase that night from your memory.

18:03.624 --> 18:06.627
Wait. You had my memory erased?

18:06.710 --> 18:08.712
I only wanted to protect you.

18:09.463 --> 18:10.964
[phone ringing]

18:14.259 --> 18:15.260
Where are you?

18:15.344 --> 18:17.179
I don't know. A pay phone.

18:17.262 --> 18:19.014
I couldn't save your father.

18:20.307 --> 18:22.101
I couldn't lose you too.

18:22.184 --> 18:26.271
You have to leave Masha
with someone unconnected who I can trust.

18:26.355 --> 18:29.024
I knew the only way to keep you safe...

18:30.067 --> 18:31.443
was to give you up.

18:36.115 --> 18:37.825
[dramatic music playing]

18:43.831 --> 18:45.040
You abandoned me.

18:47.835 --> 18:49.211
Forget the rest.

18:50.295 --> 18:56.051
Forget the lies you told my father,
your husband, your country.

18:58.846 --> 18:59.888
You abandoned me.

19:00.889 --> 19:03.308
I was trying to protect you, Masha.

19:04.393 --> 19:06.728
I had followed Raymond to America.

19:07.312 --> 19:08.438
But the KGB...

19:09.565 --> 19:12.276
started asking questions
I couldn't answer.

19:13.193 --> 19:17.030
<i>I knew it was only a matter of time</i>
<i>until they learned the truth.</i>

19:17.531 --> 19:18.782
<i>That I was a traitor,</i>

19:18.866 --> 19:21.702
a double agent working
for a secret organization.

19:22.286 --> 19:23.620
You hid from them.

19:23.704 --> 19:26.456
[Katarina] <i>Not just them, the Cabal.</i>

19:26.540 --> 19:29.918
<i>They knew Reddington stole evidence</i>
<i>of their existence.</i>

19:30.961 --> 19:32.087
The Fulcrum.

19:32.171 --> 19:36.550
They expected me to steal it back
before the intel could be exposed,

19:37.718 --> 19:39.303
but I couldn't find the Fulcrum.

19:39.970 --> 19:43.056
<i>The Cabal was afraid</i>
<i>the KGB would find me.</i>

19:43.140 --> 19:47.060
Two of the world's most ruthless
organizations wanted me dead.

19:47.144 --> 19:48.687
[grunting]

19:54.234 --> 19:58.030
The irony is that part of me
didn't wanna survive.

19:58.614 --> 20:00.782
<i>Living meant facing what I had done,</i>

20:01.283 --> 20:04.286
<i>knowing that you were with someone</i>
<i>who was a stranger to you...</i>

20:05.037 --> 20:09.416
and the trauma of killing your father
would always be part of who you were...

20:10.209 --> 20:11.293
[screaming]

20:11.919 --> 20:16.256
...and that the people hunting me
wouldn't hesitate to hunt you.

20:17.090 --> 20:19.134
You wanted to take your own life.

20:21.845 --> 20:23.013
But you didn't.

20:23.764 --> 20:26.225
Why? What changed your mind?

20:26.892 --> 20:27.726
You.

20:28.769 --> 20:31.104
I made a promise the day you were born.

20:32.648 --> 20:33.732
To protect you.

<i>I couldn't be part of your life.</i>

<i>But that didn't mean</i>
<i>I couldn't watch over you.</i>

20:41.490 --> 20:44.826
<i>I had to come up with a plan to disappear.</i>

20:46.119 --> 20:50.958
<i>So I reached out to one of the only people</i>
<i>I knew I could trust.</i>

20:52.376 --> 20:54.086
[Liz] Ilya Koslov.

20:55.337 --> 20:56.880
We grew up together.

20:56.964 --> 20:59.341
We were both chosen by the KGB.

20:59.424 --> 21:03.929
And when the Cabal came calling,
we chose to betray our country together.

21:04.012 --> 21:07.349
You can stop. I bought this story before.

21:07.432 --> 21:10.394
Dom made it sound very convincing,
but it's not the truth.

21:10.477 --> 21:13.438
Dom lied to you
about who became Reddington,

21:13.522 --> 21:16.525
but most of what he told you
about Ilya was true.

21:16.608 --> 21:19.653
Including the part
about framing Reddington as a traitor.

21:19.736 --> 21:20.862
[Katarina] No one knew he was dead.

21:20.946 --> 21:24.574
To the rest of the world,
it seemed as if he had disappeared.

21:25.158 --> 21:27.744
A fact that we used to our advantage.

21:27.828 --> 21:31.665
If the fugitive Raymond Reddington
can disappear without a trace,

21:32.541 --> 21:34.001
why wouldn't it stand to reason

21:34.084 --> 21:36.753
that the money you framed him with
could disappear as well?

21:36.837 --> 21:39.256
-Ilya, it's not that simple.
-I think it is.

21:39.339 --> 21:40.674
I had an idea.

21:41.174 --> 21:44.386
One that would allow us to access
the money used to frame Reddington,

21:44.469 --> 21:45.554
and it was a lot.

21:46.096 --> 21:48.015
-Forty million.
-Forty million.

21:50.767 --> 21:53.729
That is more than we would ever need

21:54.229 --> 21:58.233
to stay two steps ahead of the KGB,
the Cabal, the Americans.

21:58.317 --> 22:01.903
Raymond would have to show up in person
to access that money.

22:03.363 --> 22:07.367
And since he died in my arms,
he won't be able to.

22:08.744 --> 22:12.497
I don't think you're entirely grasping
what I'm suggesting.

22:12.581 --> 22:14.583
[suspenseful music playing]

22:16.293 --> 22:17.753
What are you suggesting?

22:19.463 --> 22:21.006
Becoming Reddington.

22:28.346 --> 22:30.223
Mr. Reddington. Welcome back.

22:30.307 --> 22:33.643
[man] What sort of withdrawal
will we be assisting you with?

22:33.727 --> 22:35.145
[in German] How many accounts to transfer?

22:35.228 --> 22:37.105
[in Dutch] The full amount for withdrawal?

22:37.189 --> 22:38.982
[in French] We're sorry
to lose your business.

22:42.694 --> 22:44.237
[cell phone dialing]

22:44.905 --> 22:46.531
[Ilya] Yes. It worked.

22:47.032 --> 22:47.908
[Liz] <i>No, it didn't.</i>

22:47.991 --> 22:50.619
Ilya wasn't the one
who walked into those banks.

22:50.702 --> 22:52.370
He didn't become Reddington.

22:52.454 --> 22:53.705
I did go into those banks.

22:53.789 --> 22:56.291
I impersonated your father for a few days,

22:56.374 --> 22:58.710
long enough to withdraw the 40 million.

22:58.794 --> 23:02.631
Long enough for me to realize
how valuable a new Reddington could be.

23:03.381 --> 23:05.842
-You're lying.
-[Ilya] No. Dom was lying.

23:05.926 --> 23:09.179
He misled you
into believing I became Reddington.

23:09.262 --> 23:11.556
He did that
because he couldn't accept the truth.

23:11.640 --> 23:13.809
The truth is, my mother hated Reddington.

23:13.892 --> 23:16.186
She feared him. She didn't create him.

23:16.269 --> 23:19.272
If she had, she'd have known
Reddington's true identity,

23:19.356 --> 23:20.398
but she didn't.

23:20.482 --> 23:21.942
Or else she would have told me.

23:22.692 --> 23:24.653
But she didn't tell you, did she?

23:24.736 --> 23:26.530
[woman] Because I didn't know.

23:30.033 --> 23:31.243
And I didn't know...

23:33.120 --> 23:34.955
because I'm not your mother.

23:38.166 --> 23:39.209
[Liz] Who are you?

23:39.793 --> 23:41.294
[woman] I was an operative.

23:43.338 --> 23:47.175
What kind of operative would choose
to impersonate someone who's being hunted

23:47.259 --> 23:50.762
by the most lethal organizations
and criminals in the world?

23:50.846 --> 23:52.305
I never chose to be her.

23:53.265 --> 23:54.933
That choice was made for me.

23:55.725 --> 23:57.227
I was just an asset.

23:58.562 --> 23:59.855
It was my job...

24:00.772 --> 24:04.901
until it became a death sentence
handed down to me by your grandfather.

24:04.985 --> 24:10.240
Your judgment means nothing to me.
I know what I did and why I did it.

24:10.323 --> 24:12.826
You destroyed her life and family.

24:12.909 --> 24:14.870
To save my child and grandchild.

24:14.953 --> 24:18.081
I made a calculated and brutal choice

24:18.748 --> 24:22.002
to value their lives over hers.

24:22.085 --> 24:23.336
And it worked.

24:23.420 --> 24:24.546
What worked?

24:24.629 --> 24:27.507
Nobody believed your mother was dead.

24:27.591 --> 24:33.096
The KGB were still looking, the Cabal,
the Americans, Neville Townsend.

24:33.180 --> 24:36.433
By then, I had vanished. You were safe.

24:36.516 --> 24:37.517
I was hidden.

24:38.143 --> 24:41.104
They were looking,
and they would have found you.

24:41.646 --> 24:44.024
I wasn't willing to take that chance.

24:44.107 --> 24:46.484
So he called me to Belgrade.

24:46.568 --> 24:50.614
Her enemies pooled their resources
and put a bounty on her head.

24:50.697 --> 24:53.158
They call it the Townsend Directive.

24:53.909 --> 24:54.993
Dom, I...

24:57.287 --> 24:58.330
I can't help you.

24:58.413 --> 25:00.916
You made a promise to Katarina.

25:00.999 --> 25:03.627
You told her you would look after Masha.

25:03.710 --> 25:08.381
I cannot call off Townsend,
and he will not stop looking.

25:08.465 --> 25:09.591
Sure he will.

25:09.674 --> 25:12.677
He'll stop looking,
and so will the rest of them,

25:12.761 --> 25:14.846
if Katarina's dead.

25:14.930 --> 25:17.015
[dramatic music playing]

25:17.098 --> 25:22.520
-You want me to kill your daughter.
-I want you to hear my plan.

25:23.813 --> 25:25.190
You were the plan.

25:25.732 --> 25:27.943
Yes. Ilya called me.

25:28.944 --> 25:31.446
By then we'd worked together
on a number of assignments.

25:31.529 --> 25:32.656
We were friends.

25:33.323 --> 25:34.407
I trusted him.

25:35.951 --> 25:38.078
Her real name is Tatiana Petrova.

25:38.828 --> 25:44.209
To the world, Katarina was a phantom.
Hardly anyone knew what she looked like.

25:45.335 --> 25:46.920
So I did what Dom ordered.

25:47.420 --> 25:51.091
Ilya called me to Belgrade.
It was a simple assignment.

25:51.174 --> 25:52.550
Drive into the city,

25:53.051 --> 25:56.137
deliver a package to Dominic
at Vukov Station.

25:59.266 --> 26:03.144
She has to die.
It's the only way to protect Masha.

40:05.820 --> 40:10.658
I can wait a few minutes to break through
some flimsy hatch in the floor.

40:11.283 --> 40:15.955
I should tell you that the intelligence
packets weren't the only things

40:16.038 --> 40:18.249
I acquired from my Eastern friend.

40:18.332 --> 40:21.419
<i>As I mentioned, I was young,</i>

40:21.502 --> 40:24.505
and whatever the hell vim is,
I was full of it.

40:24.588 --> 40:26.882
My appetite was voracious.

40:27.800 --> 40:31.053
And as the Soviet Union fell,
I gorged myself

40:31.512 --> 40:33.472
<i>on information,</i>

40:33.556 --> 40:37.017
money, weapons, women, men.

40:37.685 --> 40:40.771
Everyone wanted something,
and I wanted everything,

40:40.855 --> 40:43.023
including a nest in Latvia.

40:43.607 --> 40:44.942
<i>I mean, why not?</i>

40:45.025 --> 40:47.361
<i>Riga's a beautiful city.</i>

40:47.445 --> 40:50.823
The Rundale Palace
puts Versailles to shame.

40:51.824 --> 40:57.538
The country is home to more
than 7,000 breeding pairs of storks,

40:57.621 --> 40:59.748
and, well, it's a nest.

41:01.750 --> 41:04.044
Built at the height of the Cold War.

41:04.128 --> 41:09.175
<i>This facility is capable</i>
<i>of withstanding a 20-megaton blast.</i>

41:10.176 --> 41:12.136
<i>Well, not the entire facility.</i>

41:12.219 --> 41:17.892
<i>Just the... What did you call it?</i>
<i>"Flimsy hatch" in the floor.</i>

41:18.559 --> 41:24.565
Where the Russkies would take cover
in order to repel the ugly Americans.

41:25.357 --> 41:26.650
And here we are.

41:26.734 --> 41:29.487
<i>You're American. You're ugly.</i>

41:29.570 --> 41:31.280
<i>And I'm about to repel you.</i>

41:34.200 --> 41:36.202
[suspenseful music playing]

41:37.077 --> 41:38.871
-How much longer?
-[man] A minute. Maybe less.

41:38.954 --> 41:40.039
[Townsend] Make it less.

41:40.122 --> 41:43.334
<i>You see, the thing</i>
<i>about buying a Soviet nest</i>

41:43.417 --> 41:45.377
<i>is that it comes fully loaded.</i>

41:45.461 --> 41:47.671
With herring, vodka...

41:48.881 --> 41:50.466
and chlorine trifluoride,

41:50.549 --> 41:54.553
which of all the chemical gases
is of course the most flammable.

41:55.346 --> 41:56.347
[whirring]

41:59.725 --> 42:03.270
What are you gonna do?
Destroy all your intel?

42:03.354 --> 42:05.356
The source of your power?

42:06.774 --> 42:09.401
The source of my power is right here.

42:09.485 --> 42:11.612
She won't be destroyed.

42:11.695 --> 42:13.489
Certainly not by the likes of you.

42:16.075 --> 42:17.535
Aw, f...

42:18.619 --> 42:20.704
[explosion]

42:20.788 --> 42:22.790
[closing theme playing]
