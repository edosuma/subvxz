Look, dad! I'm Amadeus!

00:13.082 --> 00:15.066
My father ...

00:15.134 --> 00:18.970
- he disapproves of me!
- Ha! Well, check this out.

00:23.942 --> 00:25.910
Ta-da!

00:25.978 --> 00:28.980
- Betcha can't top that!
- Bet I can!

00:37.473 --> 00:39.157
Beat that!

00:39.224 --> 00:41.759
Huh. That was impressive, my son.

00:41.827 --> 00:45.129
But the name of the game
ain't distance nor accuracy.

00:45.197 --> 00:47.765
- It ain't?
- No, Steven.

00:47.833 --> 00:51.903
This challenge is all about
who can spit the coolest.

00:51.970 --> 00:54.950
Allow me to demonstrate.

01:07.653 --> 01:09.601
Wow, dad!

01:09.602 --> 01:12.523
Uh, dad? You okay?

01:12.591 --> 01:15.153
Help me, son.

01:16.929 --> 01:19.096
Ohh!

01:22.167 --> 01:25.002
- Beat that.
- What?!

01:25.103 --> 01:27.994
You're asking for it.

01:29.508 --> 01:32.043
You're really asking for it.

01:32.110 --> 01:39.851
Hurricane... spin... spit!

01:42.371 --> 01:48.459
- My hurricane spin spit is unbeatable.
- By jove! It's full of seeds!

01:49.628 --> 01:52.763
- Dad?
- Congratulations, son.

01:52.831 --> 01:54.632
You win by a mile.

02:00.172 --> 02:05.610
I crown thee your
watermelajesty.

02:05.677 --> 02:08.062
My liege.

02:25.597 --> 02:28.933
Huh?
Holy watermelon!

02:29.001 --> 02:31.636
Huh?

02:31.703 --> 02:33.838
Is this...

02:33.906 --> 02:40.044
Can't be. They're me!
They're all me!

02:40.112 --> 02:43.748
Hmm.
This is really impressive.

02:43.849 --> 02:47.084
I suppose.
Your mother had the power

02:47.152 --> 02:49.887
to grow sentient plant life
to act as her defenders.

02:49.955 --> 02:52.657
But Rose's plants moved and stuff.

02:52.758 --> 02:57.662
- These guys don't do... anything.
- Amethyst, be careful.

02:57.729 --> 03:01.566
This one's just a baby.
Aww! Look at him.

03:03.602 --> 03:06.537
- So precious.
- Ugh!

03:08.807 --> 03:10.781
Ohh. This is really weird.

03:10.782 --> 03:15.913
What are we gonna do
with all of them?

03:17.783 --> 03:20.718
There.
That's a mighty fine-looking

03:20.786 --> 03:23.888
table, right, baby melon?

03:23.956 --> 03:27.024
- Mm-Hmm.
- Steven! What's going on here?

03:27.092 --> 03:29.860
- You got a permit for this setup?
- Oh!

03:29.962 --> 03:32.964
Uh, hey, Mr. Smiley.
Um... here.

03:33.065 --> 03:35.666
Try one of my
watermelon Stevens!

03:35.734 --> 03:38.112
Hmm.
Yeah, I don't ... I don't know.

03:38.147 --> 03:40.430
It's kind of weird-looking.
Uh, but...

03:40.431 --> 03:44.075
I'll go ahead and accept
your bribe.

03:44.176 --> 03:45.977
- Hey, there.
- Hey, Steven.

03:46.044 --> 03:48.746
- What's all this about?
- Just a little side

03:48.814 --> 03:50.781
- project I got going on.
- Oh, really?

03:50.849 --> 03:52.149
That's great.

03:52.217 --> 03:54.151
How'd you get such
handsome watermelons?

03:54.219 --> 03:57.021
Let's just say there's a little Steven

03:57.122 --> 03:59.156
in every one of them.

03:59.224 --> 04:02.259
Great sales pitch, dude.
So, how much for one?

04:02.327 --> 04:06.097
How much?
Uh, I was just gonna give

04:06.164 --> 04:08.265
- you one, Sadie.
- Come on. I insist.

04:08.333 --> 04:10.801
I love supporting local businesses.

04:13.071 --> 04:14.839
Whoa!
What's going on here?

04:14.906 --> 04:17.608
- Hey, Ronaldo.
- Don't mind me.

04:17.709 --> 04:21.812
Just doing some live blogging
about your weird watermelons.

04:21.913 --> 04:27.752

- Steven, you shouldn't keep

04:48.373 --> 04:50.007
your customers waiting like this.

04:50.075 --> 04:52.176
I'll just give you five bucks
and take one, okay?

04:52.244 --> 04:53.811
- Sadie, wai...
- What?

04:53.879 --> 04:56.347
You're only selling them for $5?!

04:56.415 --> 04:59.650
Hey, everybody!
Come get a watermelon Steven!

04:59.718 --> 05:02.019
He's practically giving them away!

05:02.087 --> 05:04.388
Hurry before they're gone forever!

05:06.241 --> 05:09.218
And another and another

05:09.253 --> 05:11.508
and another and another.

05:11.509 --> 05:13.764
Cool. 100 pieces of money.

05:16.702 --> 05:18.302
Oh. Hey, Onion.

05:20.806 --> 05:24.308
Um... you want... my money?

05:28.113 --> 05:29.980
Oh! Sorry for the misunderstanding.

05:30.082 --> 05:32.717
I'm all out of
watermelon Stevens.

05:34.753 --> 05:38.122
Sorry, Onion.
Baby melon is not for sale.

05:42.928 --> 05:45.996
Onio-o-o-o-n!

05:50.352 --> 05:54.004
Give me back my baby melon!

05:58.343 --> 06:00.344
My baby melon!

06:00.412 --> 06:05.082
My precious. I...
thought I'd never see you again.

06:09.154 --> 06:11.656
You're... alive?!

06:11.657 --> 06:14.158
I really shouldn't be so

06:14.226 --> 06:17.294
surprised about this.
Oh, man.

06:17.362 --> 06:20.931
The other ones must
be alive, too, right?!

06:47.252 --> 06:49.393

- My watermelons came

<i> What?!</i>

07:50.377 --> 07:53.924
- Wow.
- You said they're hurting people?

07:55.460 --> 07:57.561
Rose's plants lived to fight.

07:57.629 --> 08:00.164
He can't control them.
Steven.

08:00.265 --> 08:03.200
Get in the house.

08:03.268 --> 08:04.602
- But ...
- Now.

08:06.371 --> 08:09.907
Oh, what?!
Bring it, melons!

08:11.576 --> 08:14.945
Gems, do your thing.

08:16.948 --> 08:20.017
Wait! Don't!
Come on, baby melon.

08:20.085 --> 08:23.554
We have to stop this.

08:35.067 --> 08:36.866
Come on.

08:47.345 --> 08:50.080
Everyone, please stop!

08:50.148 --> 08:53.884
I'm okay! Look!
You don't have to fight anymore!

08:55.754 --> 09:00.324
They're gonna put me
in the ground!

<i>No!</i>

09:02.527 --> 09:06.430
<i>Those flowers are lovely!</i>

09:06.498 --> 09:10.100
Let go of my spear,
you little twerps!

09:10.168 --> 09:12.136
I'll destroy you!

09:15.240 --> 09:17.207
This is bad, baby melly.

09:17.275 --> 09:19.944
How do we end this carnage?

09:35.694 --> 09:39.096
Baby... melon?

09:42.467 --> 09:48.072
Ah, let me through, you melon heads.

09:48.173 --> 09:50.791
Ba-Baby melon.

09:50.792 --> 09:54.036
I understand. You stopped the

09:54.037 --> 09:57.281
watermelons from
fighting everyone else...

09:57.349 --> 10:00.334
by making them fight you.

10:01.278 --> 10:03.320
Look at what you've done!

10:03.388 --> 10:07.524
You think I wanted this?!
You should all be ashamed!

10:07.592 --> 10:10.561
He knew this is what it would
take to calm your rage.

10:10.628 --> 10:13.902
He understood true loyalty.

10:15.472 --> 10:18.652
Go!
Think about what you've done.

10:18.653 --> 10:20.270
And don't come back until you

10:20.338 --> 10:24.074
understand what he did
for me... for all of us.

10:35.120 --> 10:37.421
Spoken like a true king.

10:37.489 --> 10:41.948
They don't need a king.
They're their own melons now.
