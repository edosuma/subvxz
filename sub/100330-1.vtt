[woman 1, on phone]  What?
He was just at the bar without
any security or anything?

00:37.803 --> 00:39.605
[woman 2]
Wait, I haven't gotten
to the best part.

00:39.739 --> 00:41.607
Next thing I know,
we're in his hotel room,

00:41.741 --> 00:44.444
and he's lathering up my titties
with that little bar of soap.

00:44.577 --> 00:47.079
It's crazy, because
I'm not even attracted to him.

00:47.212 --> 00:48.280
He's got no ass.

00:48.414 --> 00:50.216
You're more of an ass girl.

00:48.414 --> 00:50.216
Exactly.

00:50.350 --> 00:53.819
I like my men to have ass,
indeed. Okay?

00:53.953 --> 00:55.321
I don't care if they can read.

00:56.823 --> 00:58.091

00:58.224 --> 01:00.492
Barack Obama straight fucked
the shit out of me.

01:00.626 --> 01:02.595
What?

01:00.626 --> 01:02.595
But I couldn't even enjoy it.

01:02.728 --> 01:05.230
I was feeling so bad
for Michelle the whole time.

01:05.364 --> 01:09.169
I told you not to read her book.
It's ruined all my fantasies
about him.

01:09.302 --> 01:12.705
I can block out his mom jeans,
but not Sasha and Malia.

01:14.674 --> 01:16.109
What was his dick like
this time?

01:16.242 --> 01:18.044
It was dignified and confident.

01:18.178 --> 01:19.579
That dick was presidential.

01:19.712 --> 01:21.947
You want to shower first?

01:19.712 --> 01:21.947
Your hair takes longer.

01:22.081 --> 01:23.515
I'm just gonna dry shampoo.

01:23.649 --> 01:26.252
Why? It's not even greasy yet.
You're good.

01:26.385 --> 01:27.920
Really?

01:26.385 --> 01:27.920
Mm-hmm.

01:28.754 --> 01:31.657
Why is dream sex
way better than real sex?

01:31.791 --> 01:33.793
Because they come
when you want them to.

01:33.926 --> 01:35.528
Girl,
that is so true!

01:35.661 --> 01:38.164

How was your night, Syd?

02:41.394 --> 02:42.595
Yeah, how was that muffuletta?

02:42.728 --> 02:45.865
Oh, well, I ended up
eating the whole thing.

02:45.998 --> 02:50.303
And then I realized I didn't
take the paper out
between the cheese slices.

02:50.436 --> 02:52.338

Hey, B.

03:06.519 --> 03:08.587
Hey, girl,
how you doing?

03:08.721 --> 03:10.989
Did you finish up that
last batch of plum lipsticks?

03:11.123 --> 03:12.091
Uh-huh.

She's a genius.

03:20.265 --> 03:21.400
These aren't done yet.

03:21.533 --> 03:23.869
She didn't finish the mascaras?

03:24.002 --> 03:26.906
I don't like snitching on
your non-sexual life partner.

03:27.039 --> 03:28.441
Yes, you do, Barret.

03:28.574 --> 03:31.377
She ate some weed candy
and said she'd finish tomorrow.

03:31.510 --> 03:34.613
Okay. I'll clean it up in a bit.

03:34.747 --> 03:37.383

you headed to tonight?

03:34.747 --> 03:37.383

Homecoming! Okay,
what color is your dress?

03:39.552 --> 03:41.254

03:39.552 --> 03:41.254
[Mia] White and gold...

03:41.387 --> 03:44.957
All right, so now
let's finish those eyebrows off.

03:54.500 --> 03:56.468
[girl] Yes.

03:56.602 --> 03:58.771
Can I see?

03:56.602 --> 03:58.771
First, I want you to say,

03:58.905 --> 04:02.508
"I'm a badass bitch.
Look at me and bow down."

04:02.642 --> 04:03.743
But don't tell your mom.

04:03.876 --> 04:05.912
I'm a senior.
Give me a fucking break.

04:06.045 --> 04:07.112
Oh, sorry.

04:07.246 --> 04:08.447
Okay.

04:08.580 --> 04:11.417
I'm a badass bitch.
Look at me and bow down.

04:11.551 --> 04:13.620
Yes! Take a look.

04:14.153 --> 04:15.455
Oh, my God.

04:15.888 --> 04:17.122
That's me!

04:17.255 --> 04:19.992
And remember,
no sex tonight, okay?

04:20.125 --> 04:21.560
Homecoming sex
is the worst.

04:21.694 --> 04:23.662
Because
your date gets to dancing,
they get all sweaty,

04:23.796 --> 04:25.798
and that sweat gets trapped
under their cummerbund,

04:25.932 --> 04:29.102
then that moves
down to Funkytown, and that's
how you get a yeast infection.

04:29.235 --> 04:31.236
And you don't
want a yeast infection.

04:31.370 --> 04:34.473
Plus, you know,
you're only super tight
for a limited time,

04:34.607 --> 04:36.275
so you don't
want to waste it.

04:36.409 --> 04:37.710
Amen!

04:40.546 --> 04:42.347
Thanks so much for everything.

04:42.481 --> 04:43.816

the full amount.

Maybe that's the problem.

But if you can't get it,
that's what makes it cool.

05:06.672 --> 05:09.241
Yeah. People love
being denied.

to mess up our street cred.

[Mel] What a rude-ass woman!

08:57.602 --> 09:01.641
What does she do? She just gives
her rich old husband hand jobs?
I mean...

09:01.774 --> 09:03.909
[chuckles]
I love when you get mad
like this.

09:04.043 --> 09:06.679
I wish you would do this
in people's faces.
Why you don't do that?

09:06.812 --> 09:10.149
'Cause I got you for that.

09:06.812 --> 09:10.149
This is true. I got your back.

09:10.282 --> 09:12.752
She didn't know
what she was talking about.

09:10.282 --> 09:12.752
Mm-hmm.

09:12.885 --> 09:14.653
"My daughter
with the uranium..."

09:14.787 --> 09:16.822
You mean alkaline.

09:14.787 --> 09:16.822
Wasn't it uranium?

09:16.955 --> 09:19.024
No, she said alkaline.
Alkaline water.

09:19.158 --> 09:21.527
Trying to get people's
pH balance right.

09:21.660 --> 09:23.095
I can't believe her.

09:21.660 --> 09:23.095
Mm-hmm.

09:23.229 --> 09:26.899
Let's keep it one hundred.
Her daughter a ho.

09:23.229 --> 09:26.899
[chuckles]

09:27.032 --> 09:30.035
Let's just keep it one hundred.
You know who she look like?

09:30.168 --> 09:33.472
She look like
a messed-up Betty White.

09:33.606 --> 09:35.807
You know
who she really looked like?
George Washington.

09:35.941 --> 09:39.512
Yes! Like she straight off
the Quaker Oats box.

09:39.645 --> 09:41.947
[both giggling, coughing]

09:42.080 --> 09:44.749
I just look at her, and
I want to start boiling water.

09:44.883 --> 09:46.819
[coughing]

09:44.883 --> 09:46.819
[giggles]

09:48.387 --> 09:51.123
I got to open the window.

09:48.387 --> 09:51.123
It is kinda smoky.

09:52.191 --> 09:54.760
Man, I feel like eating
some oatmeal right now!

09:54.893 --> 09:58.497
You feel me? Put some butter
and brown sugar in it.

09:58.631 --> 10:00.733
[baby gurgles]

09:58.631 --> 10:00.733
Yeah, I got the munchies.

10:01.633 --> 10:03.335
Is that your stomach?

10:04.136 --> 10:05.870
It's Ryder.

10:04.136 --> 10:05.870
[gurgling, blowing bubbles]

10:06.004 --> 10:09.008
What?

10:06.004 --> 10:09.008
Somebody's here. Hi!

10:10.142 --> 10:12.144
Mm. Let me put this out.

10:10.142 --> 10:12.144
Wait, wait, wait.

10:12.277 --> 10:13.746
Okay.

10:12.277 --> 10:13.746
Wow.

10:14.313 --> 10:15.247
Girl.

10:15.381 --> 10:16.682
He was so quiet.

10:15.381 --> 10:16.682
I know.

10:16.815 --> 10:18.517
[Mel] We didn't even
see him in there at all.

10:18.650 --> 10:21.053
Girl, put that shit out.

10:18.650 --> 10:21.053
Oh, sorry.

10:21.386 --> 10:22.421
Ow!

10:22.554 --> 10:24.323
[Mia] Damn, girl.

10:22.554 --> 10:24.323
[Mel] Oh, shit.

10:24.457 --> 10:26.525
Oh, my God.

10:26.658 --> 10:29.094
That baby
look like he smoking.

10:30.262 --> 10:33.131
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold up. Hold up.

10:30.262 --> 10:33.131
[chuckles] No.

10:33.265 --> 10:35.434
[Mia] Let me get this.
Look at that.

10:35.567 --> 10:37.736
Look at it.

10:35.567 --> 10:37.736
That's terrible.
We're terrible people.

10:37.869 --> 10:40.039
We're not terrible people.
That baby sleeping good.

10:40.172 --> 10:42.607
He probably
gonna be a philosopher
when he grow up.

10:42.741 --> 10:45.778
[women chuckling]

10:47.279 --> 10:51.149
You shouldn't be sick of them.
Just watch Ryder. He sleeps--

10:51.283 --> 10:54.753
Oh, shoot.
Here they come.
We got to hide.

10:54.886 --> 10:56.389
You need to see
a baby sleep to--

10:56.522 --> 10:58.190
[Mia] Out the window,
let's go.

10:59.425 --> 11:01.727
Come on.
Come on, come on.

11:02.494 --> 11:03.629
Ah!

11:03.762 --> 11:04.963
Ah!

11:03.762 --> 11:04.963
Shoot.

11:05.097 --> 11:06.398
Okay.

11:06.532 --> 11:09.368
I love our friends,
but I can't handle
the judgment today.

11:09.502 --> 11:12.070
I think... I can do it.
I can jump in the pool.
Let's go.

11:12.204 --> 11:13.472
We can make it.

11:12.204 --> 11:13.472
Hell, no!

11:13.605 --> 11:15.074
Come on. Let's do it.
Let's do it.

11:15.207 --> 11:18.878
What is that... smell?
Is that weed? Kim!

11:15.207 --> 11:18.878
Ahh.

11:19.011 --> 11:21.880
[mocking] Oh, no, somebody's
been smoking weed in here.

11:22.013 --> 11:24.616
[inhales deeply]

11:22.013 --> 11:24.616
Who smokes weed
in front of a baby?

11:24.750 --> 11:27.052
Kim!

11:24.750 --> 11:27.052
What's going on?

11:27.185 --> 11:29.155
[Ryder's mother]
Is somebody out here?

11:30.989 --> 11:33.225
What in the literal fuck?

11:33.358 --> 11:34.393
Hi.

11:34.526 --> 11:36.561
Kim!
Such a beautiful shower.

11:36.695 --> 11:38.530
What did you guys do?

11:36.695 --> 11:38.530
[Mia] Nothing!

11:38.664 --> 11:41.266
I'm so sorry,
but I don't think
he was inhaling.

11:41.400 --> 11:43.168
What?

11:41.400 --> 11:43.168
[Mel] It was just
a tiny little bit.

11:43.302 --> 11:46.572
He didn't--
My baby was dead
for, like, a minute?

11:46.706 --> 11:48.240
No. Your baby is fine.
Not high, nothing.

11:48.374 --> 11:50.643
You guys, why didn't you
invite me to smoke with you?

11:50.776 --> 11:53.312
[Kim] You know what?
We are not in college anymore,
okay?

11:53.445 --> 11:57.282
None of y'all bitches
is better than us, okay?
All y'all got issues.

11:57.416 --> 11:59.150
You know what else we got?
We have homes.

11:59.284 --> 12:01.119
Because we have
actual accountants.

12:01.252 --> 12:05.190
And not just using TurboTax.
The trial disk of TurboTax!

12:05.324 --> 12:07.159
You should get
at least the full version.

12:07.293 --> 12:09.361
Mel, you are a mess.

12:07.293 --> 12:09.361
You stay off of Mel.

12:09.495 --> 12:13.065
Y'all need to understand, okay,
this is my friend,
and she is a good person.

12:13.199 --> 12:15.167
If it wasn't for her,
we wouldn't even have
a storefront,

12:15.301 --> 12:16.602
'cause she got
the good credit.

12:16.735 --> 12:18.436
So don't you talk shit
about my friend!

12:18.570 --> 12:22.007
Are you fucking kidding me?
You clowns need to get
your shit together!

12:22.141 --> 12:26.545
Ooh. Well...
[imitates circus music]
bitch!

12:26.678 --> 12:29.714
[Mel] What are you doing?

12:26.678 --> 12:29.714
Girl, I'm not messing up
this good hair.

12:29.848 --> 12:31.784
Here you go,
Auntie Margot!

12:31.917 --> 12:34.352
We're out of here.
Come on, girl!

12:34.486 --> 12:36.822
[both] Whoa!

[women scream]

12:38.757 --> 12:41.560
[gasping]

12:41.694 --> 12:44.830
That's not her real hair?

12:41.694 --> 12:44.830
No, it's a cultural thing.

Just 10% less.

It's the other half
of Peanut M&Ms.

13:02.481 --> 13:05.617

That's very sweet, but, no.

13:12.024 --> 13:14.526
Sorry if my booty call
kept you up last night.

No, I slept fine.

P.S. Harry's not really hairy.
He's smooth like a CPR dummy.

Not really my type, but--

You know,
he can hear you, babe.
He's right there.

13:32.110 --> 13:33.546
Oh, no. Don't worry
about my feelings.

13:33.679 --> 13:35.681
Mia and I are completely honest
with each other.

13:35.814 --> 13:38.550
This is the healthiest
relationship I've ever had.
No contract.

13:38.683 --> 13:41.620
I'm so happy
for both of you.

13:41.753 --> 13:45.791
She just a little bit bitter
because she didn't grow up
with open communication.

13:45.925 --> 13:48.226
No, but I had your mom.
And she was the best.

13:48.360 --> 13:49.995
She was the coolest,
Mia's mom.

13:50.129 --> 13:51.663
What was she like?

13:50.129 --> 13:51.663
Super-duper dope.

she left us this house
when she passed away.

13:57.402 --> 13:59.971
Meth, mostly.

13:57.402 --> 13:59.971
Yeah, she's a "cook."

She's been clean
since 2000-never.

a little dark,

we still live together?

We are?

Yes!

about putting our careers first.

your online sales

16:04.163 --> 16:05.764
for the last several months.

16:05.897 --> 16:09.568
And this... is clever.

16:14.139 --> 16:15.807
It's our best seller.

16:14.139 --> 16:15.807
Claire likes this.

16:15.940 --> 16:19.444
And so she'd like
to sit down with you
at her earliest convenience to

16:19.577 --> 16:21.112
discuss investing
in your company.

16:21.245 --> 16:23.581
What? Are you serious?

16:23.715 --> 16:25.083
[gasps]

16:25.216 --> 16:27.486
Obviously,
Claire has excellent taste.

16:27.619 --> 16:31.557
But we started this business
so that we didn't
have to answer to anyone.

16:31.690 --> 16:32.924
Thank you for stopping by.

16:33.058 --> 16:36.361
And you are the cleanest man
I've ever seen.

She's too much.

16:42.267 --> 16:44.536

I'll be right back.
Don't leave.

fresh and clean.

before it goes in your butt.

You don't even want to meet her?

16:59.084 --> 17:01.387
No. We said
we'd never sell out.

I talk about financials,
your eyes glaze over...

Nope, I have chronic glazy eye.
That's from the weed.

a way to tell you this:

since we opened the store.

Stop it. You're being
overly dramatic.

17:18.269 --> 17:22.307
Mia, if we keep
going like this, we're gonna
have to close in six months.

17:30.582 --> 17:33.185
What the hell?
Y'all got birds in here?

17:33.318 --> 17:36.554
Don't mind the drones,
they're a gift from
an admirer of Claire's.

17:36.688 --> 17:39.224
I'm not supposed to
tell anyone who it is.

17:39.358 --> 17:40.826

17:40.959 --> 17:43.127
Ooh. It's still
like you didn't
tell anyone,

17:43.261 --> 17:45.130
'cause I don't know
who the hell that is.

17:47.265 --> 17:49.000
We shouldn't be here.

You want to just
let our store close?

Is it really that bad?

17:54.439 --> 17:56.107
You know what,
don't tell me.

I can handle it.
Come on. Bring it.

to tell you these things.

Why are you taking his side?

18:29.240 --> 18:32.544
We're gonna get in trouble.
Why did you do it?
She's looking at us!

18:32.678 --> 18:34.479
Put that in your purse.

18:32.678 --> 18:34.479
What?

18:34.613 --> 18:37.582
Put it in your purse.
You a white woman.
You will not go to jail.

18:37.716 --> 18:39.350
Two different laws.
Put it in.

18:39.484 --> 18:41.352
You got that white privilege.
You won't get no jail time.

18:41.486 --> 18:43.422
Just leave it like that.

18:43.555 --> 18:45.857
Should I come back
another time?

18:43.555 --> 18:45.857
[Mel] No, no, no.

18:45.991 --> 18:50.195
I was just having
a little stretch. I'm so sorry,
I have a tight calf.

18:50.329 --> 18:53.097

this morning.

when she wants to be.

19:18.957 --> 19:21.926
[Mel] Oh, my God,
she has a Wegner Swivel Chair.

19:22.060 --> 19:24.028
That's a $10,000 chair.

19:24.162 --> 19:26.064
That is so stupid.

I'm Clara Luna...

19:51.123 --> 19:53.758

"Clear Brilliant Moon."

19:53.891 --> 19:58.530
The literal translation
is "Clear Moon."
The "Brilliant" is implied.

19:58.663 --> 20:00.531
But you can just call me Claire.

20:00.665 --> 20:02.567
It's such an honor
to meet you.

20:02.701 --> 20:04.970
The honor
is always all mine.

20:05.103 --> 20:07.271
I am so proud I found you.

I apologize.

I'm sorry.

20:36.735 --> 20:37.970
Ow! Ooh!

20:38.103 --> 20:39.605
That's weird.

20:39.738 --> 20:42.808
See, what happened was
it was flying and it hit--

20:47.812 --> 20:49.248
Was that hot?

20:49.748 --> 20:51.416
Sure.

20:49.748 --> 20:51.416
Yes!

20:52.150 --> 20:53.418
[Mel] Are you a golfer?

20:53.551 --> 20:55.353
Oh, no. It's just something
to fiddle with.

20:55.487 --> 20:58.623
Some people do it
with toothpicks,
the kids with their boogers...

20:58.756 --> 21:01.426
Some grown-ups
with the boogers, too.

20:58.756 --> 21:01.426

on the same incredible journey.

21:07.032 --> 21:10.168
Look, Claire,
our brand has value to us.

21:10.301 --> 21:13.338
We want women to realize
that they're already beautiful,

21:13.471 --> 21:15.806
not that they have to
paint it on or cover it up.

21:15.940 --> 21:19.143
We want them to shine
from the inside out.

21:19.277 --> 21:20.912

21:21.045 --> 21:22.614
More than you think.

21:23.915 --> 21:25.984
You think I don't understand
where you're coming from.

21:26.117 --> 21:28.687
But I understand more than
you understand I understand.

21:28.820 --> 21:32.056
Mel, like you,
I come from broke beginnings.

21:32.190 --> 21:36.427
And, Mia, like you,
I have a passion
for mixing color.

21:36.561 --> 21:40.532
We both started
our own business
all on our own.

21:40.665 --> 21:44.336
And I have
a mole on my face,
just like you do.

21:44.469 --> 21:46.737
I want you to feel
the bliss

21:46.871 --> 21:50.542
of looking at your products
displayed in a high-end store.

21:50.675 --> 21:55.813
I want to see your reaction
when you are looking
at your bank account...

21:56.581 --> 21:58.650

you're millionaires.

Oh.

22:04.222 --> 22:05.457
Okay.

22:06.124 --> 22:07.792
I wouldn't do that.

22:07.925 --> 22:09.327
Well, get ready.

22:09.461 --> 22:13.465
I'm going to pay
for your debt completely
for 51% of your company.

22:13.598 --> 22:18.469

an additional
$1.7 million on you.

You're literally
saving our lives. I--

22:33.618 --> 22:34.885
Can I give you a hug,
please?

22:35.019 --> 22:37.289
Nope, no hugs.
We're not taking that offer.

our company. And that's
not what we're about.

just excuse us for...

the choice.

23:01.946 --> 23:03.748
My best friend and I
discussed it.

23:03.882 --> 23:06.885
The answer is...
hell no.

23:09.254 --> 23:10.756
Okay.

23:12.357 --> 23:15.293
I'm gonna do something
I've never done,

23:15.426 --> 23:16.961

are worth it.

and you maintain

I still don't like that.

If you could please just
give us a little time to
think it over and talk about it?

23:29.374 --> 23:32.411
Okay.
It's a big decision.

23:33.444 --> 23:34.846
Don't rush it.

27:37.154 --> 27:39.057
So you don't have to worry
your pretty little head.

27:39.190 --> 27:42.794
My head is not little.
It's just that my breasts
are humongous.

27:45.029 --> 27:47.198
That's just
what I was thinking.

27:55.106 --> 27:56.740
[Mel] OMG!

27:56.874 --> 27:58.977
[squeals]

27:56.874 --> 27:58.977
[shutter clicks]

28:13.791 --> 28:15.360
Congratulations.

28:16.928 --> 28:17.862
Now we celebrate.

28:17.995 --> 28:21.800
[snaps]

28:17.995 --> 28:21.800
[Latin music starts]

28:26.604 --> 28:29.140
[woman sings in Spanish]

28:34.312 --> 28:37.648
[music continues]

28:37.782 --> 28:41.052
[Claire shouting in Spanish]

28:43.955 --> 28:45.724
Come on, Mia.

28:46.624 --> 28:48.326
[speaks Spanish]

28:53.964 --> 28:57.635
[music stops]

28:53.964 --> 28:57.635
Please stop.
Okay. We celebrated.

28:57.768 --> 28:59.504
The launch party
is in six weeks.

28:59.637 --> 29:02.974
I need you to come back
with a presentation
for what your company brand

29:03.108 --> 29:06.310
will be under
my banner...  mañana.

29:06.444 --> 29:08.680
Of course. No problemo.

29:08.813 --> 29:10.815
[sighs]
We got this. Thank you.

29:11.949 --> 29:16.654
Well, well, well.
Is this what those
Claire Luna coins gets us?

29:16.788 --> 29:19.423
You didn't have to get us
such fancy gifts,
but I love it.

29:19.557 --> 29:22.260
We wanted to.
This is a big moment
for all of us.

29:22.393 --> 29:24.228
We wouldn't be here
without you guys.

29:24.362 --> 29:26.631
Gucci, Gucci, goo!

29:26.764 --> 29:28.532
Gorgeous.

29:28.899 --> 29:30.768
Okay. So,

29:30.902 --> 29:33.337
how are we gonna rebrand
for Claire?

29:33.471 --> 29:34.906
What is our story?

29:35.039 --> 29:37.542
I'm a divorced
pet lover.
Use mine.

29:37.675 --> 29:40.811
Sydney. Love you.
Love your story.

29:40.945 --> 29:45.116
But I think we should
just stick with our own story,
you know? Keep it real.

29:45.249 --> 29:47.118
We can't go back to Claire
and tell her

29:47.251 --> 29:50.054
what we've come up with
is we're just...
keeping it real.

29:50.187 --> 29:52.323
We need to try something new.
Let's zhuzh it up a bit.

29:52.456 --> 29:55.259
Did you just say "zhuzh"?

29:52.456 --> 29:55.259
We got to zhuzh it up!

29:55.392 --> 29:58.062
Zh-zh-zhuzh?

29:55.392 --> 29:58.062
Don't be so zhuzh-mental.

29:58.195 --> 29:59.630
[laughs]

29:58.195 --> 29:59.630
[Barret] Zhh!

29:59.763 --> 30:00.831
Let's focus up!

30:00.965 --> 30:04.469
[winds down]
Zhh. Zh.

30:04.602 --> 30:09.340
What is the intersection
between what Claire wants
and what we do?

30:14.545 --> 30:17.148
[Barret] Come on, girl.

30:14.545 --> 30:17.148
We need you, Mia.

30:17.281 --> 30:18.749
You know
you the idea woman.

30:18.883 --> 30:23.387
Look,
good ideas do not come to me
if they are forced.

30:23.521 --> 30:25.222
I have a process.

30:25.355 --> 30:28.392
Let's go out.

30:25.355 --> 30:28.392
Please. Girl, what?

30:28.525 --> 30:30.428
Harry's throwing
a last-minute
birthday party.

30:30.562 --> 30:33.197
We could swing by there,
have one drink,

30:33.331 --> 30:35.066
and then I can give him
his birthday present.

30:35.199 --> 30:39.737
We've got a presentation
tomorrow. This is
seriously important homework.

30:39.871 --> 30:41.439
There'll be
young girls there.

30:41.572 --> 30:44.475
We could
ask them some questions,
maybe come up with some ideas.

30:46.944 --> 30:49.113
[club music plays]

30:56.954 --> 31:00.091
How about
day-to-night
opalescent powder

31:00.224 --> 31:02.427
called "Sparkly Face"?

31:02.560 --> 31:04.829
How about I got to
give Harry his birthday gift,

31:04.962 --> 31:08.032
so you ask
some of these other people
what they do with their makeup.

31:08.165 --> 31:10.435
I'll be right back.

31:08.165 --> 31:10.435
Mia, I can't--

31:10.568 --> 31:12.303
We don't have time!

31:12.436 --> 31:14.372
Happy birthday.

31:17.608 --> 31:21.112
Come on,
we got to make this fast,
'cause Mel and I got work to do.

31:21.245 --> 31:23.881
I'm so excited for you guys.
I've been smiling all day.

31:24.015 --> 31:26.117
You always smile all day.
Now, come on.

31:26.250 --> 31:29.120
This is crazy, this is cra--

31:26.250 --> 31:29.120
No conversation!

31:29.254 --> 31:33.057
You young people always trying
to narrate your whole damn life!

31:33.190 --> 31:36.160
It's like having sex
with somebody
on Instagram Live.

31:36.293 --> 31:39.163
[club music continues]

31:50.041 --> 31:52.109
Hey.

31:50.041 --> 31:52.109
Hey!

31:52.242 --> 31:53.877
You girls are so cute.

31:54.011 --> 31:56.714
[chuckling]

31:56.847 --> 31:58.216
Tell me about your makeup.

31:58.349 --> 32:00.851
Actually don't wear any.
Just sunscreen and lip plump.

32:00.985 --> 32:04.455
Get out! I think
I see some shadow there.

32:04.589 --> 32:07.425
Are you Melissa's mom?

32:04.589 --> 32:07.425
Fuck off! Are you?

32:09.761 --> 32:10.928
What about you,
Ginger?

32:11.061 --> 32:12.863
All my makeup
is semi-permanent.

32:12.997 --> 32:15.466
Ouch.
Thanks for nothing!

32:15.599 --> 32:17.602
[laughing]

32:20.971 --> 32:23.474
I can't believe you left me
to go and look for that guy!

32:23.607 --> 32:26.277
I know. I'm the worst.
He was so much shorter up close.

32:26.410 --> 32:27.878
[girl]
He was short from far away.

32:28.012 --> 32:29.780
Hey, girl.

32:28.012 --> 32:29.780
Where have you been?

32:29.913 --> 32:34.184
Sorry it took me so long,
but I was destroying Harry
for all future women.

32:34.318 --> 32:37.621
Is that dip?

32:34.318 --> 32:37.621
No, it's ranch dressing.

32:37.754 --> 32:39.624
Bagel chips!

32:37.754 --> 32:39.624
Hero!

32:39.757 --> 32:41.825
I am so glad I found you.

32:41.959 --> 32:44.362
[muffled chatter]

32:46.363 --> 32:49.533
[Mia] It's weird how scary
the whole world can be.

32:49.667 --> 32:54.138
And then your person shows up,
and you're like, "I'm good."

32:57.074 --> 33:02.380
And how, like,
our eyes are just wet
security cameras in our head...

33:03.247 --> 33:05.717
gathering just data.

33:07.518 --> 33:09.253
[exhales]

33:09.954 --> 33:12.423
I think I smoked too much.

33:09.954 --> 33:12.423
Yeah.

33:12.556 --> 33:13.690
[giggles]

33:13.824 --> 33:17.661
Thank God I'm not alone.
I'm really glad you're here.

33:17.795 --> 33:19.364
Always.

33:20.531 --> 33:24.669
You're my ride or die.
I'm always here for you.

33:25.569 --> 33:27.205
Like you for me.

33:29.506 --> 33:31.609
Remember
when my mom passed?

33:31.742 --> 33:34.479
I wouldn't have made it
through that funeral
without you.

33:34.612 --> 33:38.616
Everyone coming up to me,
"If there's anything
I can do for you..."

33:38.749 --> 33:42.420
And they'd walk away
before they find out
if I needed anything.

33:43.588 --> 33:48.426
And then here you come,
with them four Filet-O-Fish
sandwiches.

33:48.559 --> 33:49.860
With pickles.

33:49.994 --> 33:51.461
Them salty-ass french fries.

33:51.595 --> 33:54.732
And the chocolate shakes spiked
with the Captain Morgan's.

33:54.865 --> 33:56.167
[chuckles]

33:58.603 --> 34:01.039
That was exactly
what I needed.

34:03.474 --> 34:05.777
We so lucky
we got each other.

34:11.181 --> 34:13.484
We should get
some french fries.

34:16.219 --> 34:17.955
I got it.

34:16.219 --> 34:17.955
What?

34:18.088 --> 34:19.223
I know what we can do.

34:19.356 --> 34:21.425
And Claire Luna's
gonna love it.

34:21.558 --> 34:23.460
But first,
let's get them french fries.

34:23.592 --> 34:26.030
Hey. My name is Mia.
What's yours?

34:26.163 --> 34:27.598
Ellie.

34:26.163 --> 34:27.598
Jess.

34:27.732 --> 34:30.534
[Mia] Tell me,
what do you guys love
about each other?

34:33.270 --> 34:34.672
This one?

34:33.270 --> 34:34.672
Yeah.

34:34.804 --> 34:37.741
Or no, this one.

34:34.804 --> 34:37.741
Tap. Just make it go.

34:37.875 --> 34:40.277
[Mel]  Where did you meet?

34:37.875 --> 34:40.277
It was actually
a Halloween party.

34:40.411 --> 34:41.578
[Mel]
Oh, what were you dressed as?

34:41.712 --> 34:44.648
Destiny's Child,
but there was five of us.

34:44.781 --> 34:46.451
[laughing]

34:47.585 --> 34:49.585
[Mel] We want our products
to make you feel like

34:49.719 --> 34:52.188
you just found
your person in the crowd.

34:52.322 --> 34:53.757
Happy and safe.

34:53.891 --> 34:55.492
[Mia]
No matter how much
you see your flaws,

34:55.625 --> 34:58.061
your person is always
standing there,
reminding you:

34:58.195 --> 34:59.664
you are beautiful.

34:59.797 --> 35:02.099
We want to create a line that,
instead of hiding your flaws,

35:02.232 --> 35:03.901
boosts
your best parts.

35:04.034 --> 35:06.137
We call it "Proud."

35:11.408 --> 35:15.313
["Proud Mary" plays]

35:18.248 --> 35:19.483
"Proud Mary"?

35:19.617 --> 35:21.385
My grandma used to
play it all the time.

35:21.518 --> 35:25.055
She said, "That's the voice
of a woman that's ready
to turn up the great."

35:25.188 --> 35:26.724
We want it
to be our anthem.

35:26.858 --> 35:30.294
Her eyebrows always
look perfect.
Look at 'em!

35:30.427 --> 35:34.598
I love her skin
because it's flawless. Like,
my best friend has no flaws.

35:34.732 --> 35:36.700
And she has dimples,
they're so cute.

35:36.834 --> 35:39.103
She has natural eyebrows,
she doesn't have to fill 'em in.

35:39.236 --> 35:40.972
[video stops]

35:41.105 --> 35:44.108
How could you turn off
"Proud Mary" before
the fast part? Who does that?

35:44.241 --> 35:48.612
This is the opposite direction
to what you should be heading.

35:48.746 --> 35:50.047
This is all wrong!

35:50.181 --> 35:53.216
Too sentimental.
Mushy. It's cheesy.

35:53.350 --> 35:55.886
Sappish. Cornish.

35:56.019 --> 35:57.355
Not sexy at all.

35:57.488 --> 36:00.558
Sorry, I think Mia
was just thinking...

36:00.691 --> 36:05.829
I'm sorry...
We were just thinking that
the best kind of relationships

36:05.963 --> 36:08.765
and the best kind of makeup
make you feel beautiful.

36:08.899 --> 36:12.570
Then stitch that on a pillow,
honey, and sell it on Etsy.

36:12.703 --> 36:16.907
I am asking you
to push yourselves to the edge.

36:17.041 --> 36:18.975
I want you to be fierce!

36:19.109 --> 36:21.045
How far are you willing to go?

36:21.178 --> 36:22.813
Far!
We can go far.

36:22.947 --> 36:25.182
I know we're fierce.
We're totally fierce!

36:25.315 --> 36:26.517
Down to go places.

36:25.315 --> 36:26.517
That's why we're friends.

36:26.650 --> 36:28.385
We're gonna push you
to the edge.

36:28.519 --> 36:31.722
So afraid you gonna fall off.
But you're not.

36:31.856 --> 36:34.125
You're not.

36:31.856 --> 36:34.125
You're not.
You're gonna fall into beauty.

36:34.258 --> 36:36.260
And be beautiful.

36:34.258 --> 36:36.260
And you're gonna push it!

36:36.393 --> 36:38.094
And, like, fierce beauty.

36:36.393 --> 36:38.094
Yeah.

36:38.228 --> 36:39.664
[growls]

36:40.431 --> 36:42.166
Are we selling animal cookies?

36:42.299 --> 36:46.570
I need you to be fierce yourself
so that you can inspire
the ugly people

36:46.704 --> 36:50.441
to buy themselves
into gorgeousness!

36:50.574 --> 36:52.476
Listen to the word:

36:52.610 --> 36:54.077
Fierst.

36:54.211 --> 36:56.180
Fierst.

36:56.313 --> 36:58.149
What is it saying to you?

36:58.282 --> 37:01.352
I hear "fear" then "erst."

37:01.919 --> 37:02.986
I hear that, too.

37:03.120 --> 37:05.122
Fierst.

37:05.255 --> 37:06.623
Fierst.

37:05.255 --> 37:06.623
Fierst.

37:06.757 --> 37:07.457
Fierst.

37:07.591 --> 37:09.393
[whispers]
Now whisper it.

37:09.526 --> 37:11.027
Feel it inside you.

37:11.161 --> 37:13.731
[whisper]
Fierst. Fierst.

37:18.235 --> 37:22.006
Jarring. Unexpected.
Exhilarating.

37:22.906 --> 37:24.241
That's fierst.

37:24.375 --> 37:26.410
Can you be fierst?

37:27.177 --> 37:29.213
Uh-huh.

37:27.177 --> 37:29.213
Yes, we can certainly try.

37:29.346 --> 37:31.014
Get the car and my purse!

37:31.148 --> 37:33.551
[sighs]

37:34.718 --> 37:37.421
Okay, girls,
this is what you do well.

37:37.554 --> 37:40.557
The rest of it... no.

37:40.691 --> 37:42.660
But you've only chosen
lipstick and foundation.

37:42.793 --> 37:45.128
Yeah, and you said
you loved our One Night Stand.

37:45.262 --> 37:49.733
That's because
it was a fabulous idea
when it came out years ago.

37:49.867 --> 37:52.369
Now it's boring.
You need to evolve.

37:52.503 --> 37:55.538
That's what I've been saying.

37:52.503 --> 37:55.538
Exactly. She gets it.

37:55.672 --> 37:58.776
I need a new
exciting idea.

38:00.877 --> 38:01.745
Now!

38:01.879 --> 38:04.882
Anyone! Don't just
wait for Mia, Mel.

38:05.015 --> 38:07.118
Uh, well, um...

38:07.251 --> 38:09.053
How about a...

38:11.622 --> 38:15.559
custom-blended
two-sided lipstick,
and you can pick...

38:15.692 --> 38:18.462
whichever shade
fits your mood.

38:18.996 --> 38:20.498
Mmm.

38:21.232 --> 38:22.766
Yes.

38:21.232 --> 38:22.766
Yes.

38:22.900 --> 38:25.736
That's the kind of
creative juice
I'm looking for out of you.

38:25.870 --> 38:29.372
Great juices.
You follow that.

38:29.506 --> 38:31.541
Follow your juices, Mel.

38:31.675 --> 38:34.211
Yeah, Mel,
follow your juices.

38:34.344 --> 38:35.546
[whispers] Hey.

38:35.679 --> 38:37.213
Okay, just be respectful.

38:35.679 --> 38:37.213
You be respectful.

38:37.347 --> 38:40.217
I'm not arguing with you.

38:37.347 --> 38:40.217
I'm not arguing with you,
either.

38:40.350 --> 38:41.752
[clears throat loudly]

38:41.885 --> 38:44.688
Do you need to fight in private
or shall I count to ten?

38:44.822 --> 38:46.723
Count to ten,
because I got more shit to say.

38:46.857 --> 38:48.358
[Mel] She's trying
to help us evolve.

38:48.492 --> 38:51.595
What are we, Pokémons?

38:48.492 --> 38:51.595
No. Hey. Hey.

38:51.728 --> 38:53.130
Relax. I'm not
arguing with you.

38:53.263 --> 38:54.865
I'm just saying
I don't like that.

38:54.999 --> 38:56.099
[whispering]

38:56.233 --> 38:57.667
[Syd stomps foot] Hello!

38:58.068 --> 38:59.102
You know...

38:59.669 --> 39:01.872
fighting isn't always bad.

39:03.173 --> 39:07.277
I used to have sex
with my husband--
just amazing sex--

39:07.410 --> 39:08.946
after we fought.

39:09.079 --> 39:15.786
And then he started
having amazing sex
with himself.

39:15.919 --> 39:17.721
And, well,

39:17.855 --> 39:22.560
you know,
then we stopped fighting
and now we're not married.

39:27.164 --> 39:29.533
Mmm. Mm, mm, mmm.

39:29.666 --> 39:32.470
[R & B music playing]

39:33.870 --> 39:35.739
How many can you do in an hour?

39:35.872 --> 39:37.641
Around 75.

39:37.774 --> 39:40.610
But I don't.
Because I'm not showy.

39:40.744 --> 39:44.181
I can do 300,000, and I do.

39:44.315 --> 39:46.816
But it's so nice to see that

39:46.950 --> 39:51.188
there are actual artisans that
still work with their hands.

39:51.322 --> 39:53.423
It's so romantic.

39:53.557 --> 39:55.058
Thank you, Barry.

39:55.192 --> 39:56.594
Barret.

39:57.928 --> 39:59.162
Barret.

39:59.296 --> 40:00.564
[makes "T" sound]

40:04.768 --> 40:06.703
You have to fire him.

40:04.768 --> 40:06.703
[Mel] What?

40:06.837 --> 40:08.839
We can't do that.

40:06.837 --> 40:08.839
We not gonna do that.

40:08.973 --> 40:11.508
I'm gonna be mass producing
your products now.

40:11.641 --> 40:13.677
Sadly, he's obsolete.

40:13.810 --> 40:17.080
With all due respect,
he built this business with us.

40:17.213 --> 40:19.350
Did you know
that I had a partner
when I started out?

40:19.483 --> 40:20.450
Shay Whitmore.

40:20.584 --> 40:22.887
Josh!
We don't say that name.

40:24.588 --> 40:26.423
That woman and I
met in college.

40:26.557 --> 40:28.692
They were freshmen roommates.

40:26.557 --> 40:28.692
Josh!

40:28.825 --> 40:31.729
Whose story is it anyway?

40:28.825 --> 40:31.729
It's yours.

40:33.163 --> 40:37.667
We were best friends
and in business for 12 years.

40:37.801 --> 40:39.269
And then I had to fire her.

40:39.403 --> 40:41.405
Damn, that's some
coldhearted shit.

40:41.538 --> 40:45.509
If you want to be businesswomen,
you'll have to make
many tough decisions.

40:45.642 --> 40:47.011
He's got to go.

40:52.283 --> 40:54.685
[car starts]

41:05.863 --> 41:08.264
I'm sorry.
This is just really hard for me.

41:08.398 --> 41:11.001
It's not easy for me, either.
Let's just not do it, then.

41:11.134 --> 41:14.404
No, you heard
what Claire said, okay?

41:14.538 --> 41:17.407
It's easier for you.
That's why you should
do it. You're meaner.

41:17.541 --> 41:19.176
You're meaner on the inside!

41:19.310 --> 41:22.946
It's like
you got a little Mr. Krabs
living inside of you.

41:23.680 --> 41:25.983
You're right.
You're right.

41:26.116 --> 41:27.985
I'm secretly meaner.

[clinks]

41:29.019 --> 41:31.888
This arugula is good as hell.

41:32.022 --> 41:35.025
You know they call it "rocket"
in Europe?

41:35.158 --> 41:36.326
What the fuck is that?

41:36.459 --> 41:37.694
[chuckles]

41:37.828 --> 41:40.030
It's arugula, honey.
That sounds better, right?

41:40.164 --> 41:43.267
Mel, don't you have
something you want to say?

41:45.535 --> 41:46.670
Barret...

41:50.107 --> 41:51.275
What?

41:52.710 --> 41:55.746
Go ahead, spit it out.

41:52.710 --> 41:55.746
Yeah, spit it out, Mel.

41:56.446 --> 41:58.282
Uh-huh.

I wanted to...

What I wanted to say--

I love your suit.

Oh, thank you!

[clicks tongue, sighs]

42:25.742 --> 42:27.978

42:28.545 --> 42:29.914
You're fired.

42:32.549 --> 42:33.984

But...

42:36.319 --> 42:37.588

42:37.721 --> 42:40.256
They're outsourcing
our production. We're sorry.

Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

You know what?

42:47.631 --> 42:50.467
I knew this shit
was gonna happen.
Fuck the both of you!

42:50.601 --> 42:52.536
Don't hate me, hate Mel.
It was her idea.

42:52.669 --> 42:55.805
What are you talking about?

42:52.669 --> 42:55.805
Yes, it was your idea.
It was your idea.

42:55.939 --> 42:58.309
Oh, okay. I knew
this one was a pickled beast.

42:58.442 --> 42:59.643
But you, Mel?

42:59.776 --> 43:02.046
You want to fire me,
and you make Mia do it?

43:02.179 --> 43:03.914
Shame on your house.

43:04.048 --> 43:07.250
Wait!
Firing you is not my idea.
I promise.

43:07.384 --> 43:09.119
We wouldn't even be here

43:09.252 --> 43:12.222
had you not pushed me
into letting Claire
do a grab job on our company.

43:12.355 --> 43:14.792
She saved our company,
which was about to go broke!

43:14.925 --> 43:16.893
Oh, yeah,
and everything's
so fantastic now.

No, nothing's
fantastic now.

44:08.378 --> 44:10.080
[Jill] Thank you!

44:10.214 --> 44:11.381
[Jill] I love you.

44:11.514 --> 44:13.917
Thank you guys so much
for doing this for my birthday.

44:14.050 --> 44:15.652
Oh, my God.
Baby, anything.

44:15.786 --> 44:19.823
Ladies, if there's
one thing I have learned
in my ceviche journey,

44:19.956 --> 44:22.492
it's that it's all about
the right amount of cilantro.

44:22.626 --> 44:26.563
Is it just me, or has
working with Claire Luna
made y'all fancy?

44:26.696 --> 44:28.431
'Cause I'm getting a fancy vibe.

44:28.565 --> 44:31.568
She's a very
impressive person.
She fucked Drake.

44:31.701 --> 44:33.703
[woman] Is that true?

44:31.701 --> 44:33.703
Just stop, okay?

44:33.837 --> 44:37.708
Because you are gonna make Mel
jealous, because she wants
to fuck Claire Luna.

44:37.841 --> 44:39.476
Oh.

44:37.841 --> 44:39.476
Okay!

44:39.610 --> 44:40.944
[chuckling]

44:41.077 --> 44:43.179
Well, you sure showed us.

44:43.313 --> 44:46.616
We are just so sorry
that we ever
doubted your choices.

44:46.750 --> 44:48.251
So proud of you.

44:46.750 --> 44:48.251
Thank you.

44:48.385 --> 44:51.354
I never did doubt it.

44:48.385 --> 44:51.354
Yeah, it was mostly me.

44:51.487 --> 44:54.557
I just have to say
that I am looking around
the room at these ceviches

44:54.691 --> 44:57.794
and they all look beautiful,
but Mel,
yours looks best of all.

44:57.928 --> 44:59.595
I appreciate that, Brook.
Thank you.

44:59.729 --> 45:03.800
Look at that,

complimenting Mel's ceviche!

suck her dick, too?

45:07.037 --> 45:08.471
I'm not interested
in sucking Brook's dick.

45:08.605 --> 45:10.807
I think you're just jealous
because Claire likes me more.

45:10.940 --> 45:12.375
Ooh.

45:10.940 --> 45:12.375
[scoffs]

45:12.508 --> 45:15.312
Why don't we move it on
to the chile rellenos, shall we?

45:15.445 --> 45:17.948
Step one,
we want to add
a little cheese.

45:18.081 --> 45:20.050
And step two,
I actually don't
have a penis.

45:20.183 --> 45:22.085
But if you did,
we would suck it.

45:22.219 --> 45:23.753
[Jill] Yeah, she's
over the legal limit.

45:23.886 --> 45:26.824
Actually,
I'm very happy for Mel.

45:26.957 --> 45:29.860
She finally found someone
that likes her more than me.

45:29.993 --> 45:32.896
Ooh, boy.

45:29.993 --> 45:32.896
Success has changed you.

45:33.030 --> 45:34.497
It's changed something,
that's for sure.

45:34.630 --> 45:37.968
I would express more shock,
but I've had so much Botox.

45:38.101 --> 45:40.236
[chef]
Okay, it might be time
to kick it up a notch.

45:40.370 --> 45:42.873
So, I happened to bring with me
some ghost peppers.

45:43.006 --> 45:46.643
I will pass them around.
Ladies, I'm telling you,
they are very spicy.

45:46.777 --> 45:48.278
Just a little sliver
goes a long way.

45:48.411 --> 45:50.681
Wait, hold up.
Maybe you want to
call Claire

45:50.814 --> 45:53.116
and ask her permission
to use a ghost pepper.

45:53.249 --> 45:55.919
Claire? Hello?
Are you on the line?

45:56.053 --> 45:57.988
Just call me
when you grow up, okay, Mi?

45:58.121 --> 46:00.757
Oh, when I grow up?
Oh, I'm grown.
I'm real grown.

46:00.890 --> 46:03.559
You the one that's the crybaby.
You the one that cries
all the time.

46:03.693 --> 46:04.895
Oh, oh.

46:05.028 --> 46:05.862
Why don't you call Claire
and cry to Claire?

46:05.996 --> 46:07.530
Go cry to Claire.

46:07.664 --> 46:10.033
The fake crying
is gonna make me lactate,
but this is great.

46:10.166 --> 46:12.235
"Mia won't
let me kiss your ass."

46:12.368 --> 46:14.771
I think they're
really mad at each other.
Shouldn't we do something?

46:14.904 --> 46:19.209
No!
I have not seen adults be shitty
to each other in a minute.

46:19.342 --> 46:21.811
This is better than watching
that little bitch Caillou!

46:21.945 --> 46:23.146
Who the fuck
is Caillou?

46:23.279 --> 46:25.181
He's this kid on Nickelodeon.
Fucking idiot.

46:25.314 --> 46:28.285
Why don't we
actually move it on
into the living room

46:28.418 --> 46:31.321
for some mezcal
and some tequila?

46:31.455 --> 46:33.056
[all] Yeah!

46:33.189 --> 46:35.825
Yeah!

46:33.189 --> 46:35.825
Dick or no dick,
I love that Brook!

46:35.959 --> 46:37.660
Whoo!

46:35.959 --> 46:37.660
It's-It's no dick.

46:37.794 --> 46:41.164
[Jill] More booze!
Maybe we'll be swimming
in a baby pool full of flan.

46:41.297 --> 46:42.866
I would watch it.

46:41.297 --> 46:42.866
That's enough.

46:42.999 --> 46:47.137

I can have as many as I want,
'cause I run this country.

[chattering]

46:49.806 --> 46:52.175

It's birthday time.

46:49.806 --> 46:52.175
[Kim] Thank you.

46:52.308 --> 46:54.611
[Jill]
You won't remember this anyway.

46:54.745 --> 46:57.280
You cry to Claire.
You cry to Claire.

47:02.485 --> 47:04.087
Chiles up your ass.

47:07.457 --> 47:09.993
Well, this is
the first alcohol I've had
since the baby was born,

47:10.126 --> 47:12.662
and I got to tell you,
it feels right!

47:12.795 --> 47:13.797
[ladies] Mm-hmm!

47:13.931 --> 47:15.332
[Kim] Well,  bon appétit.

47:15.465 --> 47:18.801
Or as they say
in español,  buen provecho.

47:18.935 --> 47:22.606
[Jill] Oui, oui.

47:18.935 --> 47:22.606
[woman laughs]

47:22.739 --> 47:24.140
[Kim]
I want to do more of this.

47:24.274 --> 47:26.309
Have a birthday,
you want to make changes.

47:26.442 --> 47:28.911
[woman] Oprah says you don't
start living until you're 40.

47:26.442 --> 47:28.911
Mmm!

47:29.045 --> 47:30.814
You okay?

47:29.045 --> 47:30.814
Yeah, but a little spicy.

47:30.948 --> 47:32.582
Oh, yeah.

47:30.948 --> 47:32.582
[woman] Yeah.

47:32.715 --> 47:34.451
Well, Mexican food
is spicy.

47:34.584 --> 47:37.321
[coughs]
Very hot.

47:38.188 --> 47:39.789
Nobody else's
lips are burning?

47:39.923 --> 47:41.024
[women] No.

47:41.157 --> 47:44.461
Just ease up on the...
Have some water.

47:44.594 --> 47:45.996
Uh, chef?

47:46.129 --> 47:49.232
Do ghost peppers get hotter
when you cook them?

47:49.365 --> 47:51.067
No it shouldn't,
not if you just
used a sliver.

47:51.201 --> 47:53.036
[Jill] "Sliver"?
I want to see that movie.

47:53.169 --> 47:55.438
I learned how to masturbate
with that movie.

47:55.572 --> 47:56.506
That's not right.

47:56.639 --> 47:58.208
[Jill] Okay.

47:56.639 --> 47:58.208
[groaning]

47:58.341 --> 48:00.610
[woman] Yeah, just
have some water, honey.

47:58.341 --> 48:00.610
[Jill] There you go.

48:00.744 --> 48:03.547
[Kim] There go you.
That's better.

48:00.744 --> 48:03.547
That's right.

48:04.714 --> 48:06.082
[belches]

48:04.714 --> 48:06.082
[all] Oh!

48:06.216 --> 48:08.785
[groans]
It's getting hotter.
It's getting hotter.

48:08.918 --> 48:10.920
Oh, this is hot!

48:11.053 --> 48:13.023
Whoo! [belches]

48:21.631 --> 48:23.399
[shouting]

48:21.631 --> 48:23.399
Okay.

48:23.533 --> 48:26.869
It burns so bad it hurts!
It hurts!

48:27.003 --> 48:28.738
[Kim]
Breathe through it.

48:28.872 --> 48:30.106
[Kim] Oh, my God.

48:28.872 --> 48:30.106
Shit!

48:30.240 --> 48:32.208
[Jill] She's choking!

48:30.240 --> 48:32.208
[woman] I know Heimlich.

48:32.342 --> 48:33.643
I will save your life,
Mia!

48:33.776 --> 48:37.013
[Kim] You have to go higher.

48:33.776 --> 48:37.013
Keep it in the middle.

48:37.147 --> 48:41.050
Yes. Yes.

48:37.147 --> 48:41.050
If you die on my carpet...

48:41.184 --> 48:42.919
Don't you die!
I swear to God.

48:43.053 --> 48:44.420
[woman] It didn't work.

48:44.554 --> 48:46.890
Here's some bread.
It'll soak it all up.

48:47.024 --> 48:50.060
Oh, that's a lot of carbs!

48:47.024 --> 48:50.060
It's only 20 points.

48:50.193 --> 48:51.595
Here you go, honey. Milk.

48:51.728 --> 48:54.664
This is what I do with Ryder.
Mama's feeding you milk.

48:54.798 --> 48:55.999
There it is.

48:56.132 --> 48:57.333
There you go.

48:57.467 --> 48:59.569
It's goat's milk.
It's thick.

49:03.606 --> 49:04.541
[coughs]

49:04.675 --> 49:09.445
This is the first
motherfucking night...

49:09.579 --> 49:12.882
since I had Ryder
that I washed my body.

49:13.015 --> 49:17.154
I did my hair,
I put on some makeup
to hang out with my girls...

49:17.287 --> 49:21.324
instead of staying home
eating wet Cheerios stuck
on my baby's crevices

49:21.458 --> 49:23.794
and his thick little thighs.

49:23.927 --> 49:25.395
Fuck you, Mia!

49:25.828 --> 49:27.230
Fuck you!

49:39.976 --> 49:41.310

49:41.444 --> 49:43.579
[Mia] Ooh, I pray for
the healing of this bootyhole.

49:43.713 --> 49:47.884
Please heal this bootyhole.
This is bad!

49:48.017 --> 49:50.053
Ooh.

49:55.025 --> 49:56.225
I'm in here!

49:56.359 --> 49:57.760
Yeah, that's you.
That's your fault.

49:57.893 --> 50:00.664
I am so sorry again
about what happened
last night.

50:00.797 --> 50:03.166
I lost my mind for a minute.
I don't want to fight with you.

50:03.300 --> 50:06.536
I just want us to work together
and make this deal happen.

50:11.307 --> 50:14.610
Why the hell did you do that?
Barret's my best friend.

50:14.744 --> 50:17.813
And he's brilliant,
and he's tender,
and you hurt him.

50:17.947 --> 50:19.849
We didn't have a choice.

50:19.983 --> 50:21.618
It sucks for all of us.

50:21.751 --> 50:24.187
No, but he was my person!

50:24.321 --> 50:27.090
And I know
he's never gonna
be my husband, and...

50:27.224 --> 50:29.993
thanks to my therapist,
I'm learning to accept that.

50:30.127 --> 50:34.097
Would you like a hug?

50:30.127 --> 50:34.097
No! I don't want a hug.

50:35.098 --> 50:36.599
What are you doing?

50:36.733 --> 50:38.968
What is wrong with you?
Yes, of course
I would like a hug.

50:39.102 --> 50:40.203
I don't know
why you wouldn't know that.

50:40.337 --> 50:43.607
[bell jingles]

50:40.337 --> 50:43.607
Surprise!

50:43.740 --> 50:47.176
It's the angry carrot.
What can I get you?
Nothing? Good.

50:47.310 --> 50:52.282
Okay, girls, show me the
presentation on the two-sided
lipstick idea you came up with.

50:52.415 --> 50:55.118
Well, everything
has gotten
a little sidetracked

50:55.252 --> 50:56.753
because of
what happened
with Barret.

50:56.887 --> 50:58.522
Oh, my God!

50:58.655 --> 51:02.992
He's not even here anymore,
and he's still
slowing down production!

51:03.126 --> 51:04.661
Come on.
Show me what you got.

51:04.794 --> 51:07.697
So, here we have
two normal lipsticks.

51:07.830 --> 51:11.467
And the idea is,
if we just join them together...

51:11.601 --> 51:14.804
You just stick them
together like that.

51:14.938 --> 51:16.706
Real hard, like they're,

51:16.839 --> 51:18.808
you know, two dogs mating.

51:18.941 --> 51:20.177
[growling]

51:22.945 --> 51:27.050
My Oviedo customers
do not want to think
of the penis of a dog

51:27.184 --> 51:29.719
rubbing on their lips
because it's disgusting.

51:29.852 --> 51:31.154
Yes, disgusting.

51:31.287 --> 51:33.456
Two dogs copulating?
That's what you came up with?

51:33.589 --> 51:36.259
We're so off-track.
That's not what I meant.

51:36.393 --> 51:37.928
This is appalling.

51:38.061 --> 51:39.629
And it's your fault.

51:39.762 --> 51:43.199
You cannot let the other one
get in the middle
of the creative.

51:43.333 --> 51:45.201
That one does the accounting.

51:45.334 --> 51:47.170
You know her limitations.

51:47.303 --> 51:48.872
You failed her!

51:49.005 --> 51:52.709
Uh, you blaming me
for the dog-sex lipstick?

51:49.005 --> 51:52.709
Yeah.

51:52.842 --> 51:55.045
I don't know what you want,
but this is not
how you're gonna get it.

51:55.178 --> 51:56.345
Wow.

51:56.479 --> 51:58.348
I'm sorry. I loved dogs
when I was little.

51:58.481 --> 52:00.750
I mean,
not their dicks,
but...

we really disappointed her.

52:13.196 --> 52:14.764
Take a Lyft!

52:19.035 --> 52:23.139
Hey. So Claire's decided
to bring a different company
to the launch party

52:23.272 --> 52:24.541
instead of you.

52:24.674 --> 52:26.642
Whoa, whoa, what?

52:24.674 --> 52:26.642
What bitch is taking our spot?

52:26.776 --> 52:30.213
It's actually two men.
Straight guys.
You know them. Get Some?

52:30.346 --> 52:31.514
She bought their company.

52:31.647 --> 52:33.850
Oh, no.

52:31.647 --> 52:33.850
Those Maroon 5-looking dudes?

52:33.984 --> 52:36.819
Okay.
You guys, they've actually
got a proven track record.

52:36.953 --> 52:39.155
They created
the online-dating app PostD8.

52:39.288 --> 52:40.490
What's PostD8?

52:40.623 --> 52:42.125
It is a totally gross
and chauvinistic app,

52:42.259 --> 52:44.828
where guys
can go on and tell women
they've previously dated

52:44.961 --> 52:47.964
what was wrong with them
to "help them out."

52:48.097 --> 52:49.633
Yeah, I'm on it.

52:49.766 --> 52:51.835
My landlord said
that my teeth
are too sharp.

52:51.968 --> 52:54.504
Why would Claire even want to be
associated with those pigs?

52:54.638 --> 52:59.108
She didn't, okay?
That is why Claire
is so upset with you.

52:59.242 --> 53:00.777
She is a feminist!

53:00.910 --> 53:03.847
And now, because of you guys,
she has to go with two dudes.

53:03.980 --> 53:05.315
That makes zero sense.

53:03.980 --> 53:05.315
Yeah.

53:05.448 --> 53:07.516
Okay, I'll explain.
Good news, your debt is paid.

53:07.650 --> 53:09.518
Bad news, Claire's
never helping you again.

53:09.652 --> 53:11.020
And, per your contract,
you now have to give Claire

53:11.154 --> 53:15.124
49 cents of every dollar
for the rest of your lives.

53:15.258 --> 53:19.496

Actually, that's a lie.
I am.

57:42.358 --> 57:44.126
Very sorry and embarrassed.

57:44.259 --> 57:46.996
I apologize for the both of us.

57:44.259 --> 57:46.996
Don't apologize for me.

57:47.129 --> 57:49.431
Okay, I won't.
But I apologize for me.

57:49.565 --> 57:51.568
Can you please
just give us another chance?

57:51.701 --> 57:55.438
I don't want another chance.
I don't want to be
in her world at all.

57:55.572 --> 57:56.906
And here's what's about
to happen, okay?

57:57.039 --> 57:59.542
You're giving us
our company back!

58:00.376 --> 58:02.011
No problem.

58:03.212 --> 58:07.016
You just pay me back
the half a million that
I paid for your debt.

58:07.149 --> 58:11.320
Plus interest. Plus $4,000
for the drone you destroyed.

58:11.454 --> 58:12.455
You destroyed it.

58:12.589 --> 58:14.157
Fine.

58:14.290 --> 58:17.293
For the drone
you were going to steal
and you made me destroy.

58:17.426 --> 58:19.996
Let's just call it 600K,
shall we?

58:25.335 --> 58:27.070
You can add this to my tab.

58:34.543 --> 58:37.046
Was that "fierst"
enough for you?

58:43.686 --> 58:45.054
[yelps]

58:47.089 --> 58:50.926
I know the real reason
why you keep messing
with us.

58:51.060 --> 58:54.264
You can't stand to see
two best friends
living their best life

58:54.397 --> 58:56.132
and running
a business together.

58:56.265 --> 58:58.968
It's the only thing
you ever failed at in life.

59:02.705 --> 59:04.240
Do you think she's right?

59:06.576 --> 59:09.045
No. No. No.

59:09.178 --> 59:11.480
You're successful,
you're independent.

59:11.614 --> 59:14.183
Who wouldn't want to be you?

59:15.384 --> 59:17.152
What do you think, Mia?

59:18.053 --> 59:20.355
She telling you
what you want to hear.

59:21.023 --> 59:22.424
[Claire]
I think you're right.

59:22.558 --> 59:24.561
And that's smart.

59:25.528 --> 59:27.730
She knows where the power is.

59:29.031 --> 59:32.101
I'm going to gift you
one last chance.

59:32.235 --> 59:36.105
I host an event every month
for insiders. It's called,
"Beauty and Bubbles."

59:36.239 --> 59:39.875
You ladies are gonna do
a live tutorial there.

59:40.009 --> 59:43.145
And if it's well received,
then you're back on track

59:43.279 --> 59:46.415
and I will present you
at my launch party.

59:46.548 --> 59:49.184
If you mess it up,
then you're out.

59:49.318 --> 59:51.287
Thank you so much.

59:51.687 --> 59:52.922
No way.

01:00:02.064 --> 01:00:03.265
[dings]

01:00:03.398 --> 01:00:06.302
It's like
she says no to things
just to piss me off.

01:00:06.435 --> 01:00:10.572
I feel I have to walk on
eggshells when I'm around her,
or she'll freak out.

01:00:10.706 --> 01:00:12.408
You remind me of myself.

01:00:12.541 --> 01:00:13.576
Oh.

01:00:13.709 --> 01:00:15.744
When I was whiny
and weak and lame.

01:00:16.412 --> 01:00:17.780
Remember my former partner?

01:00:17.913 --> 01:00:19.415
Shay Whitmore?

01:00:17.913 --> 01:00:19.415
Shh. We don't have to
say the name.

01:00:19.548 --> 01:00:22.585
That woman disagreed
with every single thing I did.

01:00:22.718 --> 01:00:27.056
Eventually,
I stopped telling her things.
I was keeping things from her.

01:00:27.189 --> 01:00:29.392
Same! But I don't
want to do that
with Mia anymore.

01:00:29.525 --> 01:00:32.628
Then you have to stand up to her
like I did with Shay.

01:00:32.761 --> 01:00:35.198
Nothing will change
in your company...

01:00:36.199 --> 01:00:38.700
until you change.

01:00:38.834 --> 01:00:40.737
You feel me?

01:00:38.834 --> 01:00:40.737
Mm-hmm.

01:00:53.282 --> 01:00:54.683
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

01:00:54.817 --> 01:00:56.051
[sighs]

01:00:57.119 --> 01:00:59.087
I need to talk to you.
We're going to
Beauty and Bubbles,

01:00:59.221 --> 01:01:00.857
and I'm not taking no
for an answer.

01:01:00.990 --> 01:01:03.960
I'm not going.

01:01:00.990 --> 01:01:03.960
No, you are going, okay?

01:01:04.093 --> 01:01:06.796
I'm not asking you,
I'm telling you.
[voice cracks]

01:01:08.130 --> 01:01:09.064
Really?

01:01:09.198 --> 01:01:10.366
Mm-hmm.

01:01:16.071 --> 01:01:17.106
Ooh!

01:01:19.708 --> 01:01:21.610
You can clean that up.

01:01:21.744 --> 01:01:24.880
You been doing cocaine
and didn't ask me
if I wanted some?

01:01:25.014 --> 01:01:26.849
That was a lifetime promise.

01:01:29.085 --> 01:01:30.653
Please.

01:01:30.786 --> 01:01:34.057
You know that I won't be able
to live with myself
if I don't at least try.

01:01:39.595 --> 01:01:40.763
[sighs]

01:01:40.896 --> 01:01:43.465
Okay, I'll go.

01:01:43.599 --> 01:01:44.867
For you.

01:01:47.469 --> 01:01:49.372
[crowd cheering]

01:01:49.505 --> 01:01:52.041
Hello, you fabulous women!

01:01:52.174 --> 01:01:56.812
Welcome
to my ongoing series,
Beauty and Bubbles.

01:01:56.945 --> 01:02:02.217
Tonight we are going to
pit two emerging cosmetic duos
against each other,

01:02:02.351 --> 01:02:08.657
and you get to decide
which one will join
my Oviedo empire.

01:02:08.791 --> 01:02:13.396
[cheering]

01:02:08.791 --> 01:02:13.396
From Mia & Mel,
please welcome Mia and Mel.

01:02:15.564 --> 01:02:16.966
What is this, Claire?

01:02:17.099 --> 01:02:21.303
And from Get Some Cosmetics,
please welcome Greg and Ron.

01:02:21.437 --> 01:02:24.039
You guys look gorgeous.

01:02:21.437 --> 01:02:24.039
Get Some! Claire Bear!

01:02:24.173 --> 01:02:29.378
Our gorgeous guinea pigs
are Layla and Lola Farrell.

01:02:32.215 --> 01:02:32.882
Twins?

01:02:33.015 --> 01:02:34.216
Yeah.

01:02:33.015 --> 01:02:34.216
Whoa.

01:02:34.349 --> 01:02:36.886
Okay, Greg and Ron,
show us what you've got.

01:02:37.019 --> 01:02:39.488
Let's do this. Get Some!
Have a seat, milady.

01:02:39.621 --> 01:02:43.326
You know, we are gonna
turn this face from "meh"...

01:02:43.459 --> 01:02:44.993
to "meh-gnificent."

01:02:45.127 --> 01:02:47.296
Mia? Mel?
Come on, girls!

01:02:50.999 --> 01:02:54.970
[Ron] Lot of blemishes.
A lot going on here.
I think we'll do a max glam.

01:02:55.104 --> 01:02:56.639
How are you today?

01:02:55.104 --> 01:02:56.639
Good.

01:02:56.772 --> 01:03:00.643
Good. Your skin looks amazing!
What do you do to keep it up?

01:03:00.777 --> 01:03:03.312
I drink a lot of water.

01:03:00.777 --> 01:03:03.312
That is the key.

01:03:03.445 --> 01:03:06.048
When they get pissed off,
it's over.

01:03:03.445 --> 01:03:06.048
[scoffs]

01:03:06.181 --> 01:03:09.051
Put some lips on you,
and it'll be great.

01:03:06.181 --> 01:03:09.051
Smile for me.

01:03:09.185 --> 01:03:12.053
Okay, don't smile.
Just do the pout.

01:03:09.185 --> 01:03:12.053
We don't fix teeth here.

01:03:12.187 --> 01:03:13.722
What do you love about makeup?

01:03:13.856 --> 01:03:17.393
I love how fun it is.
And you're like,
"Oh, my God, I'm hot."

01:03:17.526 --> 01:03:20.062
Who do you think
is gonna crack first,
Mel or Mia?

01:03:20.195 --> 01:03:22.597
Your lashes are
thickish and longish.

01:03:20.195 --> 01:03:22.597
Yeah.

01:03:22.731 --> 01:03:25.400
You just need
to shine a light on them
with a bit of...

01:03:25.534 --> 01:03:26.935
...mascara.

01:03:25.534 --> 01:03:26.935
Mm-hmm.

01:03:27.069 --> 01:03:29.872
There you go. Beautiful.

01:03:27.069 --> 01:03:29.872
[Lola] Thank you.

01:03:30.006 --> 01:03:32.375
No, I was talking about
his technique.

01:03:30.006 --> 01:03:32.375
Thank you.

01:03:40.649 --> 01:03:42.218
It's beautiful.

01:03:40.649 --> 01:03:42.218
Right?

01:03:45.854 --> 01:03:48.290
Now let's see how everyone did.

01:03:48.424 --> 01:03:51.093
Mia and Mel,
walk us through
Layla's look.

01:03:51.226 --> 01:03:52.662
Yes.

01:03:52.795 --> 01:03:56.465
At Mia & Mel, we're not
about painting it on.
We don't like that.

01:03:56.598 --> 01:04:00.169
We like to see it shine through.
Look at you!

01:04:00.302 --> 01:04:01.236
Thank you.

01:04:01.370 --> 01:04:03.539
Now, fellas,
show us your look.

01:04:04.306 --> 01:04:06.309
[crowd wows]

01:04:04.306 --> 01:04:06.309
Voilà.

01:04:07.676 --> 01:04:09.211
Lola is a very cute girl,

01:04:09.345 --> 01:04:12.281
but we knew she could
be a stone-cold fox.

01:04:12.414 --> 01:04:16.285
So we started with
an all-over matte foundation
to cover up her flaws.

01:04:16.419 --> 01:04:19.789
Then, of course, we finished it
with our signature Get Some...

01:04:19.922 --> 01:04:21.824
[together]
...Poppin' Cherry Lipstick.

01:04:21.957 --> 01:04:24.961
Lola, Layla,
please come closer.

01:04:26.562 --> 01:04:27.796
[laughs]

01:04:27.930 --> 01:04:32.068
It's funny.
It's almost like
a before and after, right?

01:04:32.934 --> 01:04:34.971
[laughing]

01:04:36.705 --> 01:04:38.574
Actually,
we're not finished yet.
Sit down.

01:04:38.707 --> 01:04:40.609
[Mia]
What? We did what we wanted.
Leave it alone.

01:04:40.743 --> 01:04:43.445
We're not done. We just have
a little more work to do
on our twin.

01:04:43.579 --> 01:04:45.814
Just give me a second.

01:04:43.579 --> 01:04:45.814
What are you doing?

01:04:45.948 --> 01:04:48.317
What is wrong with you?

01:04:45.948 --> 01:04:48.317
I'm fixing this.

01:04:49.385 --> 01:04:50.986
You can't keep trying
to please someone

01:04:51.119 --> 01:04:52.988
who keeps
screwing you over and over.

01:04:53.121 --> 01:04:54.624
She's not your mother.

01:04:55.991 --> 01:04:58.694
Mel, you are so right
about her.

01:04:58.828 --> 01:05:02.497
She really is ruthless
when she doesn't
get what she wants.

01:05:02.631 --> 01:05:06.602
I see what you mean
by always having to
walk on eggshells around her.

01:05:09.337 --> 01:05:11.073
So that's
what you're doing?

01:05:11.206 --> 01:05:14.643
You're sitting around
talking shit about me
with Claire behind my back?

01:05:15.644 --> 01:05:19.348
No, I just don't know how
to deal with you sometimes!

01:05:19.482 --> 01:05:23.285
Well, you could've
figured that out a long time ago
by just trusting me.

01:05:23.419 --> 01:05:26.923
You don't have to
deal with me no more.
I quit.

01:05:44.974 --> 01:05:47.042
You just gave her
control of our company!

01:05:47.176 --> 01:05:49.611
Hasn't been our company
for a long time, Mel.

01:05:49.745 --> 01:05:50.979
That is not true!

01:05:51.113 --> 01:05:53.082
The only reason
you ever wanted us to succeed

01:05:53.215 --> 01:05:54.450
is 'cause you're obsessed

01:05:54.583 --> 01:05:56.251
with what everybody
thinks about you.

01:05:56.384 --> 01:05:57.819
You don't care
what anyone thinks.

01:05:57.953 --> 01:06:00.456
You just do
whatever you want to do.
You're so selfish!

01:06:00.589 --> 01:06:01.623
I'm selfish?

01:06:00.589 --> 01:06:01.623
Yeah!

01:06:01.757 --> 01:06:03.191
I've been taking care of you

01:06:03.325 --> 01:06:04.926
since the first day
I walked into
your broke-ass home.

01:06:05.060 --> 01:06:06.595
So I'm just
a charity case?
Huh?

01:06:06.729 --> 01:06:08.630
I wish you'd told me that
so I didn't waste my life

01:06:08.764 --> 01:06:11.200
trying to get you
to do things
you're too scared to do!

01:06:11.333 --> 01:06:12.734
This ain't about you
supporting me.

01:06:12.867 --> 01:06:15.804
It's about you trying to prove
that you're not a nobody!

01:06:16.538 --> 01:06:19.207
I'd rather be a nobody
than a bully.

01:06:19.341 --> 01:06:22.778
I'm done with you
weighing me down.

01:06:22.912 --> 01:06:25.982
This last 20 years
has been a waste.

01:06:55.077 --> 01:06:58.514
You guys were right.
We never should've started
the company to begin with.

01:06:58.647 --> 01:07:01.950
Oh, my God, the only reason
that we were so bitchy about it

01:07:02.084 --> 01:07:03.652
is because
we were so jealous of you.

01:07:03.785 --> 01:07:06.688
It's true.
So much of my diary
is designated

01:07:06.822 --> 01:07:10.358
to feeling left out
and jealous
of you and Mel's friendship.

01:07:10.492 --> 01:07:13.095
You got to hang out every day
with your best friend.

01:07:13.228 --> 01:07:16.431
We get to hang out
with our families,
which is great, but sometimes...

01:07:16.565 --> 01:07:20.436
We get to hang out
with our families,
which is awesome, but

01:07:20.569 --> 01:07:23.072
sometimes you just want to
be with your friends.

01:07:23.205 --> 01:07:28.009
You two are gonna work it out.
You're like sisters.
It's beautiful.

01:07:28.143 --> 01:07:29.745
Yeah, Kim's right.

01:07:29.879 --> 01:07:32.447
I mean, I don't know
anything about sisters
as I'm an only child,

01:07:32.581 --> 01:07:36.385
but it is beautiful,
and you will work it out.

01:07:37.085 --> 01:07:38.721
Thanks, ladies.

01:07:40.889 --> 01:07:42.391
I don't know.

01:07:48.764 --> 01:07:50.466
What are you doing?

01:07:51.533 --> 01:07:53.001
Zillowing.

01:07:53.134 --> 01:07:57.706
I have to find
more affordable housing,
as I am currently unemployed.

01:08:06.915 --> 01:08:08.717
It's a knockoff.

01:08:08.851 --> 01:08:10.285
Clearly.

01:08:10.419 --> 01:08:12.420
I'm sorry, Barret.

01:08:13.054 --> 01:08:15.090
We never should've
fired you.

01:08:15.224 --> 01:08:17.593
You know,
I'm not mad that you fired me.

01:08:17.725 --> 01:08:19.795
I know that Claire
gave you no choice.

01:08:19.928 --> 01:08:22.997
What I don't understand is
why you never called me
afterwards.

01:08:23.131 --> 01:08:24.765
This is the first time
we're speaking.

01:08:24.899 --> 01:08:27.935
And I suspect it's only because
you don't have Mel right now.

01:08:28.069 --> 01:08:31.340
I can't do this.

01:08:28.069 --> 01:08:31.340
Sit your ass down!

01:08:32.474 --> 01:08:34.577
I ain't done with you yet.

01:08:36.679 --> 01:08:39.581
Do you understand
what Mel does for you?

01:08:39.714 --> 01:08:41.984
She doesn't do--

01:08:39.714 --> 01:08:41.984
You have no idea.

01:08:42.117 --> 01:08:45.821
Every day,
she comes into the store,
she sets it up perfectly,

01:08:45.955 --> 01:08:49.692
so you can come in
and be a whirling dervish
of creativity.

01:08:49.825 --> 01:08:50.959
And when it's all over...

01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:53.127
she cleans up after you

01:08:53.261 --> 01:08:55.630
so you can come back in
the next day and do it
all over again.

01:08:55.764 --> 01:08:57.999
And I suspect
it's the same at home.

01:08:58.899 --> 01:09:02.871
I mean, she does put toothpaste
on my toothbrush.

01:09:03.005 --> 01:09:04.807
Almost every day.

01:09:08.977 --> 01:09:10.712
Hey, Syd.

01:09:10.845 --> 01:09:13.881
How are you?
That's a pretty dress.
Where's it from?

01:09:14.015 --> 01:09:19.654
Oh. Yeah,
I found it on a chain-link fence
out in front of the school.

01:09:19.787 --> 01:09:21.323
Yeah.

01:09:22.390 --> 01:09:25.827
It's been pretty dull
without you. Both of you.

01:09:25.961 --> 01:09:27.296
Syd...

01:09:28.863 --> 01:09:31.866
Mia and I aren't gonna
work together anymore.

01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:34.203
Can I tell you something?

01:09:34.336 --> 01:09:38.473
I just know
that you're so scared that
you can't tell her anything.

01:09:38.607 --> 01:09:41.042
So you can't
work anything out.

01:09:41.176 --> 01:09:43.546
That's how this whole mess
started.

01:09:44.546 --> 01:09:45.580
Fuck.

01:09:45.714 --> 01:09:48.483
Come on.
You guys got to
come back to work.

01:09:48.616 --> 01:09:51.086
You do. I mean,
did you see this?

01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:52.886
I found this
on the Get Some website.

01:09:53.020 --> 01:09:56.692
Claire Luna is introducing
a new product
at her launch party.

01:09:57.226 --> 01:09:59.227
What?

01:09:59.361 --> 01:10:02.831
She ripped us off.
That's One Night Stand!

01:10:02.965 --> 01:10:05.734
You're gonna let someone
just take your best seller?

01:10:05.867 --> 01:10:08.270
And your best friend?

01:10:14.342 --> 01:10:16.277
[phone rings]

01:10:16.411 --> 01:10:17.679
I was just about to call you!

01:10:17.812 --> 01:10:19.614
Where are you?
I need to tell you something.

01:10:19.748 --> 01:10:21.150
I just left the store.
Where are you?

01:10:21.283 --> 01:10:23.018
I'm headed towards the store.
I'll find you.

01:10:23.151 --> 01:10:26.588
I have to tell you something.
I can't believe I brought
that tiny--

01:10:26.721 --> 01:10:28.656
What I have
to tell you is
way more important.

01:10:28.790 --> 01:10:31.060
No, it's not more important
than what I have to tell you.

01:10:31.193 --> 01:10:32.594
I need to apologize.

01:10:32.727 --> 01:10:35.163
I was so blind
to everything you do.
You were right.

01:10:35.297 --> 01:10:38.767
I was scared.
I was unfair to you, and--

01:10:44.940 --> 01:10:47.242
I'm so sorry
I ever took you for granted.

01:10:47.375 --> 01:10:48.944
I'm so sorry.

01:10:49.077 --> 01:10:52.080
No, you were right.
I need to change,
and I'm gonna do better.

01:10:52.914 --> 01:10:55.717
I just don't ever
want to disappoint you.

01:10:55.850 --> 01:10:58.854
You're my family.
You're my home.

01:11:01.023 --> 01:11:03.358
I don't know
what I would do without you.

01:11:03.491 --> 01:11:06.095
Girl,
I didn't brush my teeth
for three weeks!

01:11:06.228 --> 01:11:07.562
[sobbing, laughing]

01:11:07.696 --> 01:11:11.032
I'm so sorry I ever believed
anything she ever said.

01:11:11.166 --> 01:11:12.634
I'm sorry I blew our chance.

01:11:12.767 --> 01:11:14.236
We never had a chance!
You were right.

01:11:14.370 --> 01:11:16.638
She gave One Night Stand
to the Get Some guys.

01:11:16.771 --> 01:11:17.939
Ooh.

01:11:18.073 --> 01:11:21.176
Nobody steals our ideas
and gets away with it.

01:11:22.177 --> 01:11:25.714
You know what?
We're gonna break
this bitch's back.

01:16:43.098 --> 01:16:44.366
Hello, Claire.

01:16:46.634 --> 01:16:49.838
Oh, I see what's going on here.

01:16:49.971 --> 01:16:52.473
You're trying to steal my girls
to get back at me.

01:16:52.607 --> 01:16:55.810
No, I don't need
to steal your girls,
because you pushed them out.

01:16:55.944 --> 01:16:57.111
Just like you pushed me out.

01:16:57.245 --> 01:16:58.847
Oh, my God,
I've had enough of that drama.

01:16:58.980 --> 01:17:00.882
Go talk to my lawyer.
Shoo! [snaps fingers]

01:17:01.015 --> 01:17:03.418
Oh, Claire.
You're still the same.

01:17:03.551 --> 01:17:07.823
We were a great team.
But you always had to be right
at all costs.

01:17:07.956 --> 01:17:09.357
Mm-hmm.

01:17:07.956 --> 01:17:09.357
And you haven't changed.

01:17:09.490 --> 01:17:13.394
Even your face looks like
it hasn't smiled in 30 years.

01:17:13.528 --> 01:17:17.265
Is that
supposed to be an insult?

01:17:13.528 --> 01:17:17.265
Well, yeah, to your soul.

01:17:17.399 --> 01:17:19.400

you look great.

Obviously,
I overestimated you two.

You are nothing
but a baby and a bully.

01:17:27.109 --> 01:17:29.677
You know what?
No, okay?

01:17:29.811 --> 01:17:31.512
We're smart,
and we're strong,

01:17:31.646 --> 01:17:33.849
and we're best friends,
and we love and respect
each other.

01:17:33.982 --> 01:17:36.017
And you know what you are,
Claire Luna?

01:17:36.150 --> 01:17:40.221

they are looking crazy.
But keep going.

01:17:48.296 --> 01:17:50.866

You have Blue Waffles.

01:17:54.669 --> 01:17:56.037
