00:33.887 --> 00:37.610
- Happy Birthday, Mom!
- Oh, thank you, everybody.

00:37.629 --> 00:41.667
I know it's a little self-centered,
but this is my favorite day of the year.

00:41.726 --> 00:44.484
Here, Mom, this is from me and Meg.

00:45.975 --> 00:48.748
Topol? The smoker's tooth polish?

00:48.780 --> 00:50.813
Take the hint.

00:50.891 --> 00:53.255
Happy Birthday, sweetheart.

00:54.236 --> 00:56.810
Lionel Ritchie's "Can't Slow Down"?

00:56.844 --> 00:59.175
Great album, Lois. Great album.

00:59.196 --> 01:02.127
I didn't know who I was
until I heard this album.

01:04.095 --> 01:05.729
Oh, God, Lionel.

01:06.609 --> 01:08.221
You have been hurt.

01:08.776 --> 01:12.633
You have been hurt by somebody,
that much is clear.

01:13.526 --> 01:15.222
Who hurt you?

01:15.697 --> 01:17.931
Who hurt you? Who hurt you?

01:17.946 --> 01:19.963
Who hurt you? Who hurt you?

01:20.136 --> 01:23.580
Oh, thank you all so much.
What thoughtful gifts.

01:23.666 --> 01:25.433
Uh, Lois, there's one more.

01:25.457 --> 01:27.981
Oh, Brian, you don't have
to give me anything.

01:28.596 --> 01:29.920
Well, give it back then.

01:31.477 --> 01:32.973
No, no, we have fun.

01:34.575 --> 01:35.961
Oh, my God!

01:35.995 --> 01:37.801
Two tickets for a cruise?

01:38.338 --> 01:40.081
Brian, this is wonderful.

01:40.116 --> 01:41.701
- What the hell?
- Brian!
- You fink!

01:41.778 --> 01:43.873
Hey, hey, hey, hey. What is this?

01:43.907 --> 01:45.900
We agreed on a $20 limit.

01:45.918 --> 01:47.453
We set a cap, you jerk.

01:47.475 --> 01:50.133
Are you trying to make us look bad,
you son of a bitch?

01:50.167 --> 01:52.011
Peter, what are you angry about?

01:52.017 --> 01:53.902
You get to go on a cruise with me.

01:53.926 --> 01:54.681
- What?
- What?

01:54.706 --> 01:58.380
Well, yeah, you didn't think Brian
meant for me to go with him, did you?

01:58.477 --> 02:01.932
Great. This was a bigger waste of time
than Ringo's song-writing.

02:03.046 --> 02:04.722
Hey, guys. I wrote a song.

02:04.748 --> 02:05.700
Oh, that's great.

02:05.725 --> 02:07.523
- Oh, good, Ringo.
- Fantastic.

02:07.547 --> 02:10.512
You know what?
I'm gonna put it... right here.

02:10.735 --> 02:12.632
Right on the refrigerator.

02:12.667 --> 02:14.882
That way we'll get to see it everyday.

02:14.906 --> 02:16.353
All right.

02:19.767 --> 02:22.370
Now, you kids behave yourselves
while we're away.

02:22.388 --> 02:25.831
Yeah, be good till we get back,
and Brian, stay out of the cat box!

02:25.865 --> 02:27.590
Stay out of the cat box!

02:28.155 --> 02:30.181
- Bye, you guys!
- Bye, Mom!

02:30.226 --> 02:31.451
Bye, Dad!

02:31.497 --> 02:33.323
Farewell, Brian, I'm off to sea.

02:33.366 --> 02:35.832
An hour from now,
I'll be surrounded by seamen.

02:35.916 --> 02:37.922
Sperm whales and seamen.

02:38.036 --> 02:39.132
Ooh, a swallow.

02:39.157 --> 02:41.203
Stewie, Peter and Lois
aren't taking you with them.

02:41.216 --> 02:42.283
They've already boarded.

02:45.205 --> 02:46.813
Bye! Bye!

02:47.168 --> 02:51.190
Bye! Bye! Bye! Bye!

02:51.415 --> 02:53.101
Bye! Bye!

02:53.386 --> 02:54.891
No! No, you can't leave!

02:54.947 --> 02:56.891
Not without me! I'm the baby!

02:56.937 --> 02:59.833
Oh, I haven't been this disappointed
since I saw The Lake House.

03:00.086 --> 03:02.580
See, the mailbox is like a time portal.

03:02.617 --> 03:04.691
Everything Keanu Reeves puts in there,

03:04.716 --> 03:06.940
Sandra Bullock gets two years later.

03:12.758 --> 03:15.311
Oh, my Hickory Farms package is here.

03:18.895 --> 03:21.191
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid
I'm gonna have to bar you

03:21.206 --> 03:23.822
from the aft section of the ship
for the rest of the cruise.

03:24.018 --> 03:25.560
We are so sorry.

03:25.577 --> 03:27.663
Peter, what the hell did you think
you were doing?

03:27.678 --> 03:29.830
Lois, it is called the "Poop Deck."

03:30.186 --> 03:31.810
That is why I pooped there.

03:31.826 --> 03:33.871
- You're disgusting.
- And you're misleading.

03:37.695 --> 03:39.771
Boy, this is romantic, isn't it, Lois?

03:39.796 --> 03:41.520
Oh, it sure is, sweetie.

03:41.556 --> 03:44.793
Uh, I feel like that
fat-ass British girl from Titanic.

03:44.838 --> 03:45.672
What girl?

03:45.688 --> 03:49.222
The lead in Titanic,
the one opposite Leonardo DiCaprio.

03:49.275 --> 03:51.253
- Sweetheart, that was a guy.
- What?

03:51.286 --> 03:53.592
That was a guy.
That was Philip Seymour Hoffman.

03:53.606 --> 03:55.362
What? No, it wasn't.

03:55.386 --> 03:58.271
Yes, it was, honey.
It was Philip Seymour Hoffman.

03:59.007 --> 04:01.191
Look at you out here on a big trip.

04:05.605 --> 04:06.571
What are you doing?

04:06.586 --> 04:09.193
I'll teach that hussy
to go on a boat ride without me.

04:09.205 --> 04:11.612
When she returns,
I'm going to put bamboo splinters

04:11.626 --> 04:12.950
under all her fingernails.

04:12.965 --> 04:15.060
Then I'm gonna strip her down
and tie her to the bed.

04:15.086 --> 04:15.850
Okay.

04:15.866 --> 04:17.832
Then I'm gonna make her crawl
on her hands and knees

04:17.848 --> 04:20.152
while I drip hot candle wax
all over her back.

04:20.177 --> 04:21.821
Uh, and then what are you gonna do?

04:21.865 --> 04:22.993
Uh, let's see...

04:23.017 --> 04:25.380
Are you gonna shower her off
after all that candle wax?

04:25.396 --> 04:26.941
No, I'm gonna keep her filthy.

04:26.965 --> 04:28.763
Yeah, she's been a bad girl.

04:28.778 --> 04:31.112
And then I'm gonna gag her
with her own brassiere.

04:32.446 --> 04:34.120
- What?
- No, no, nothing, nothing.

04:34.148 --> 04:36.731
That's all part of
your diabolical plan to...

04:37.117 --> 04:39.841
- humiliate her.
- Yes, yes, she'll be humiliated.

04:39.855 --> 04:41.531
Maybe you'll handcuff her?
She'll hate that.

04:41.548 --> 04:43.710
- Then I shall do that as well!
- And call her a bitch.

04:43.727 --> 04:45.082
Until I'm hoarse with rage!

04:45.096 --> 04:47.022
Maybe smack her ass with a riding crop?

04:47.046 --> 04:48.040
Yes, and then... What?

04:48.056 --> 04:49.273
No, I mean, that-that would like, 

04:49.336 --> 04:50.702
that, that would show her.

04:50.928 --> 04:51.563
Are you...?

04:51.778 --> 04:55.090
You're getting some kind of
sick sexual thrill off this, aren't you?

04:55.095 --> 04:57.072
Who cares?
You're not gonna kill her anyway.

04:57.098 --> 04:59.832
You're gonna bitch and moan, and then
you're gonna do what you always do :

04:59.847 --> 05:02.641
the minute Lois walks through that door,
you're gonna forget all about it,

05:02.657 --> 05:05.333
beg for your apple juice,
go poop and fall asleep.

05:06.378 --> 05:07.890
God, he's right.

05:07.987 --> 05:10.693
I've got the same daily routine
as Dick Clark.

05:10.857 --> 05:12.703
Rupert, I've been all talk.

05:12.756 --> 05:14.622
So much time wasted.

05:14.717 --> 05:16.031
Well, no longer.

05:16.067 --> 05:17.520
Lois is a dead woman!

05:17.538 --> 05:20.383
I'll do to her what douche bags
did to the guitar.

05:21.507 --> 05:23.423
This is a song I wrote last summer.

05:23.545 --> 05:24.732
It's called :

05:24.905 --> 05:25.810
"Water".

05:28.237 --> 05:30.701
<i>My hair is growing</i>

05:32.168 --> 05:34.912
<i>Growing all the time</i>

05:37.078 --> 05:39.590
<i>Look how sensitive I am</i>

05:40.237 --> 05:43.742
<i>'Cause my voice is so fine...</i>

05:45.477 --> 05:47.963
<i>Every beer I've ever had</i>

05:48.708 --> 05:51.480
<i>Is on a shelf above my bed</i>

05:54.405 --> 05:57.570
<i>And sometimes I put my speakers</i>

05:57.696 --> 05:59.810
<i>Facing out my window.</i>

06:09.597 --> 06:13.262
Peter, stop picking your teeth.
We're at the Captain's table.

06:13.308 --> 06:16.771
And that was the first time
I saw the Northern Lights at their peak.

06:16.906 --> 06:18.452
And as I gazed,

06:18.488 --> 06:21.672
astonished,
at their lustrous brilliance,

06:21.838 --> 06:24.170
I turned to my first mate and I said,

06:24.637 --> 06:28.330
"We are looking
into the very eyes of God."

06:28.558 --> 06:30.851
Oh, what a wonderful story.

06:30.865 --> 06:32.353
All right, I got one for ya.

06:32.375 --> 06:35.403
So me and Lois are driving up
to Vermont to get this abortion...

06:35.415 --> 06:37.923
- Peter!
- Hang on, hang on, Lois. Don't ruin it.

06:37.947 --> 06:40.133
All right, so we're driving up
to get this abortion

06:40.148 --> 06:41.800
and we get to the abortion clinic

06:41.815 --> 06:43.783
and the abortionist has one hand.

06:43.797 --> 06:46.340
- Peter, for god's...
- Bah-bah. I'll tell it, I'll tell it.

06:46.384 --> 06:48.105
So I turn to Lois and I says,

06:48.136 --> 06:49.847
"You want to get an abortion here?"

06:49.875 --> 06:52.909
"You want to get an abortion with
the abortionist having a stump hand?"

06:52.919 --> 06:54.511
"We can't get an abortion here."

06:54.605 --> 06:57.293
So, we turned around and went home
and two-and-a-half months later

06:57.307 --> 06:58.791
our daughter Meg was born.

07:03.426 --> 07:06.803
Okay, explain to me exactly
what I did wrong.

07:06.826 --> 07:09.840
Peter, that story was
completely inappropriate!

07:09.845 --> 07:12.650
Well, send me the crap to hell
for being nostalgic

07:12.665 --> 07:14.361
about the early years of our marriage.

07:14.377 --> 07:16.491
You've totally ruined this trip for me!

07:16.515 --> 07:19.361
I am mortified to even show
my face around this ship!

07:19.385 --> 07:22.463
Hey, the captain's the one who should
be embarrassed. His story was gay.

07:22.846 --> 07:24.091
You're gay!

07:50.695 --> 07:51.813
Hello, Mother.

07:52.686 --> 07:53.561
Stewie?

07:53.838 --> 07:55.110
What the hell are you...

07:55.198 --> 07:56.630
How did you get here?

07:56.725 --> 07:59.052
Oh, there's a very simple
answer to that.

07:59.096 --> 08:00.652
You drove me here, Lois.

08:00.676 --> 08:02.841
With all the indignities
I've been forced to suffer

08:02.866 --> 08:05.580
day in and day out
under your matriarchal tyranny.

08:05.966 --> 08:07.232
What are you... wh...

08:07.256 --> 08:09.022
what are you doing with a gun?

08:09.056 --> 08:12.623
Something I should've done
a very long time ago.

08:45.106 --> 08:46.892
I did it! I killed her!

08:46.927 --> 08:48.001
She's dead!

08:52.975 --> 08:54.972
Mommy! Mommy!

08:55.266 --> 08:57.542
Mommy!
Oh, yeah, that's right.

09:02.037 --> 09:05.173
And finally, still no word on
the disappearance of Lois Griffin,

09:05.187 --> 09:06.793
housewife and mother from Quahog

09:06.826 --> 09:09.262
who vanished from
a cruise ship six days ago.

09:09.297 --> 09:10.721
Well folks, that's
the news, and

09:10.746 --> 09:11.483
I...

09:11.497 --> 09:12.331
am...

09:12.358 --> 09:13.830
outta here!

09:14.397 --> 09:16.673
Daddy, she's been missing so long.

09:16.858 --> 09:18.562
Do you think they'll ever find her?

09:18.577 --> 09:20.151
God, I hope so, Meg.

09:20.196 --> 09:22.180
Oh, yes, I'm sure they'll find her.

09:22.287 --> 09:25.331
<i>This is fantastic.
Nobody suspects a thing.</i>

09:25.435 --> 09:27.543
<i>Ooh, listen to my voice,
that sounds cool.</i>

09:27.777 --> 09:29.222
<i>Hellooooo!</i>

09:29.868 --> 09:31.040
<i>Piiggggggssss</i>

09:31.067 --> 09:32.001
<i>innnnnn</i>

09:32.026 --> 09:33.910
<i>Spaaacccceeee!</i>

09:35.837 --> 09:38.692
Hi, Peter. Can I talk to you
in the kitchen for a second?

09:40.366 --> 09:43.152
What is it, Joe?
Please tell me Lois is alive.

09:43.926 --> 09:46.371
It's been six days, Peter. I'm sorry,

09:46.396 --> 09:48.543
but we had to call off the search.

09:48.767 --> 09:51.741
I'm afraid you're just going
to have to accept the fact that..

09:52.317 --> 09:53.363
she's gone.

09:53.646 --> 09:56.342
No!

10:04.678 --> 10:06.142
<i>We now return to...</i>

10:06.167 --> 10:09.403
<i>"Harrison Ford Telling Random People
He Wants His Family Back."</i>

10:09.905 --> 10:12.291
- I want my family back!
- Okay.

10:12.538 --> 10:15.141
- Give me back my family!
- Get off me!

10:15.308 --> 10:16.931
I want my family back!

10:19.098 --> 10:21.312
- Hey, where've you been?
- Ah, I had another date.

10:21.358 --> 10:23.963
You know, I'm glad you're finally
putting yourself out there.

10:23.995 --> 10:25.810
Lois would've wanted you to move on.

10:25.857 --> 10:27.683
Yeah, only this one was kind of awkward.

10:27.705 --> 10:29.283
My date was a stick figure.

10:29.697 --> 10:30.690
So...

10:31.218 --> 10:32.380
how would this work...

10:32.795 --> 10:33.730
in bed.

10:33.787 --> 10:37.182
Well, I can't do sex.
But I can give you a stick job.

10:37.577 --> 10:39.383
That a... that sounds...

10:39.405 --> 10:41.173
Yes, it is very unpleasant.

10:41.376 --> 10:44.092
But the freakiest was that date
I had with Bonnie.

10:44.238 --> 10:45.252
Peter...

10:45.275 --> 10:47.541
you don't know how badly I need this.

10:47.568 --> 10:49.953
I don't know, Bonnie,
it's, it's just a little weird.

10:49.975 --> 10:52.383
- Joe's a friend of mine.
- No, it's okay.

10:52.415 --> 10:55.402
- I promise you it's okay.
- Eh, I'm not sure.

10:56.287 --> 10:57.763
It's okay, Peter.

10:58.075 --> 10:59.653
Just remember, whatever you do,

10:59.668 --> 11:01.260
don't tell Chris I'm dating.

11:01.278 --> 11:03.532
Peter, Lois has been dead
for a whole year.

11:03.557 --> 11:05.022
You're gonna have to tell him sometime.

11:05.948 --> 11:07.133
Hi, Dad.

11:07.158 --> 11:10.302
Did we get any mail
from Mom at the health spa today?

11:10.327 --> 11:11.500
Nope, sorry, Chris.

11:11.515 --> 11:14.133
She said she's going straight
from the spa right back to Europe.

11:14.135 --> 11:17.581
But I haven't seen Mom since
she took me back-to-school shopping.

11:17.797 --> 11:20.523
All right, sweetie,
you ready to get some new notebooks

11:20.557 --> 11:22.502
and protractors and slacks?

11:22.526 --> 11:25.131
- I want blue jeans.
- You're getting slacks!

11:28.706 --> 11:29.700
Here you go, Stewie.

11:29.717 --> 11:33.103
Finish your oatmeal, and then I'll get
you ready for our "Mommy and Me" class.

11:33.306 --> 11:36.541
You know, Meg has really flourished
since Lois was murdered.

11:36.586 --> 11:37.883
What are you talking about?

11:37.906 --> 11:39.362
Lois's death was an accident.

11:39.397 --> 11:42.323
Which is just what someone
who pulled off the perfect murder

11:42.338 --> 11:43.620
would want you to think.

11:43.647 --> 11:44.690
What the hell are you...?

11:45.287 --> 11:46.133
Stewie,

11:46.546 --> 11:47.462
did you...

11:47.938 --> 11:50.730
- Did you kill Lois?
- Of course I didn't, Brian.

11:51.015 --> 11:52.733
Remember what you said?

11:52.776 --> 11:54.262
I'm all talk.

11:54.305 --> 11:56.890
I wouldn't possibly go through with it.

11:56.918 --> 11:59.130
I'll just poop and fall asleep.

11:59.257 --> 12:00.313
My God,

12:00.408 --> 12:01.471
you did it.

12:01.517 --> 12:02.941
You actually did it.

12:02.967 --> 12:04.753
Oh God,
I've really screwed myself up here.

12:04.775 --> 12:07.673
Could you reachin to my pocket and
get the number for that acupuncturist?

12:07.675 --> 12:10.013
You son of a bitch, you killed Lois.

12:10.047 --> 12:12.713
Good luck proving that, Brian.
Seriously, that number?

12:12.736 --> 12:15.142
Well, I'm going to expose you
for what you are.

12:15.165 --> 12:17.871
No matter what it takes,
you are going to pay for this.

12:18.305 --> 12:21.323
You know, it's funny, from this
position, I can hear Meg upstairs.

12:22.727 --> 12:25.733
I'm going to pretend
you're the New York Knicks.

12:29.617 --> 12:32.503
Hey, put your wallets away, guys.
The drinks are on me.

12:32.538 --> 12:35.270
Well, that's awful nice, Peter.
What's the occasion?

12:35.296 --> 12:37.570
Lois' life insurance policy paid off.

12:37.595 --> 12:39.811
I got more money than Barbara Streisand.

12:39.966 --> 12:41.882
Honey, I'm going shopping.

12:44.725 --> 12:46.511
And I was going to valet park.

12:47.685 --> 12:50.783
I didn't know that you
had life insurance on Lois.

12:50.796 --> 12:52.743
Did you get that
right before the cruise?

12:52.767 --> 12:54.311
Actually, I got it on the cruise.

12:54.338 --> 12:56.022
Right after we had
that big fight when I said,

12:56.028 --> 12:58.532
"I wish you were dead,"
right before I never saw her again.

12:58.668 --> 13:01.233
Well, see you guys later.
I got to go buy hot dogs.

13:01.266 --> 13:03.061
We keep running out for some reason.

13:04.105 --> 13:06.992
Either of you guys think
it's a little suspicious

13:07.006 --> 13:10.050
that Peter took out a
life insurance policy on Lois

13:10.085 --> 13:11.953
right before she went missing?

13:11.965 --> 13:13.020
You don't think...

13:13.045 --> 13:15.210
That fat bastard murdered her,
didn't he?

13:15.235 --> 13:18.390
That son of a bitch!
He's a killer, like Bernie Goetz!

13:19.368 --> 13:21.693
You know, the subway vigilante
from the eighties?

13:21.715 --> 13:24.450
I used to do a bit about him back
when I was doing standup.

13:24.515 --> 13:26.032
Ah, what else is in the news?

13:26.066 --> 13:28.382
Oh, oh, Bernie Goetz.
Did you hear about this?

13:28.408 --> 13:31.840
This guy Bernie Goetz
shot a bunch of muggers on the subway.

13:31.998 --> 13:35.003
Wouldn't mind having him with me
next time I go see my mother-in-law.

13:35.917 --> 13:38.403
No, but really, New York City's
a great place to live...

13:38.416 --> 13:39.872
if you're a cockroach.

13:39.915 --> 13:41.773
<i>- You suck!</i>
- I know.

13:45.507 --> 13:49.220
Hey, Stewie, I found this receipt for a
speedboat rental upstairs in your room.

13:49.247 --> 13:50.643
It's dated about a year ago.

13:50.656 --> 13:52.132
Any idea how it got there?

13:52.166 --> 13:54.930
Um, someone who rented a
speedboat must have left it there.

13:54.948 --> 13:55.742
Uh-huh.

13:55.768 --> 13:57.303
Well, you can play innocent
all you want.

13:57.316 --> 13:59.620
I am going to find the evidence
to put you away.

13:59.638 --> 14:01.960
Starting by proving that
you were on that cruise ship

14:01.976 --> 14:03.220
the night Lois disappeared.

14:03.235 --> 14:05.841
No, I wasn't.
I was at the carnival with Rupert.

14:05.987 --> 14:08.192
Ah, the carnival with Rupert.

14:09.035 --> 14:10.863
We won! We won!

14:10.908 --> 14:13.142
Do it again!
Now I want a pink one!

14:13.177 --> 14:15.823
Stewie, we've been playing
for half an hour.

14:15.835 --> 14:18.453
Oh, okay. You want to go ride
the tea bags... tea cups?

14:39.745 --> 14:42.233
I was hoping to keep
these mementos, Rupert,

14:42.265 --> 14:45.300
but I can't risk it with the dog
sniffing around for evidence.

14:53.136 --> 14:55.283
Damn!
What the hell are they doing here?!

14:55.998 --> 14:57.872
What are we looking for, Joe?

14:57.918 --> 15:00.090
Well, the trail is pretty cold by now,

15:00.116 --> 15:04.001
but if Peter did kill Lois,
we might find some clues in his garbage.

15:04.035 --> 15:07.173
Man, I haven't dug through these cans
since Lois died.

15:07.245 --> 15:10.792
Can't believe it's been 12 months
since I've deliberately choked myself

15:10.816 --> 15:13.653
by stuffing her discarded makeup sponges
down my throat.

15:13.685 --> 15:15.193
What's wrong with you?

15:16.787 --> 15:18.003
Oh, my God.

15:20.066 --> 15:22.761
That does look like Peter's handwriting.

15:24.376 --> 15:26.142
There's no doubt anymore.

15:26.455 --> 15:28.312
Peter murdered his wife.

15:30.536 --> 15:33.601
This is fantastic!
I'm completely off the hook!

15:34.685 --> 15:35.761
What the hell?

15:36.048 --> 15:39.101
Hey, little man,
tell Chris to open his window.

15:42.097 --> 15:47.413
<i>Just around the corner
there's a rainbow in the sky</i>

15:47.986 --> 15:51.111
<i>So let's have another cup of coffee</i>

15:51.146 --> 15:53.933
<i>And let's have another piece of pie...</i>

16:01.367 --> 16:03.421
Joe, what the hell is going on?

16:03.436 --> 16:07.122
You're a suspect in Lois' murder,
that's what's going on!

16:07.128 --> 16:10.903
Don't make us go good cop,
developmentally disabled cop on you.

16:10.935 --> 16:11.833
Um,

16:12.118 --> 16:13.461
we know that,

16:13.488 --> 16:14.270
um,

16:14.307 --> 16:17.161
you, um, killed Lois.

16:18.407 --> 16:19.513
Um,

16:19.678 --> 16:20.742
hello?

16:22.206 --> 16:23.942
Uh...

16:24.477 --> 16:25.451
no.

16:26.706 --> 16:28.101
We can, um,

16:28.427 --> 16:30.393
put you at the, um,

16:30.736 --> 16:33.360
scene where she, um, was,

16:33.755 --> 16:35.063
um, killed.

16:35.105 --> 16:37.911
Hobey's right, Peter.
It doesn't look good for you.

16:37.945 --> 16:39.610
Joe, you got this all wrong!

16:39.637 --> 16:42.122
Like God did when he made
Rosie O'Donnell.

16:43.275 --> 16:45.652
You can't put a vagina on this man!

16:45.668 --> 16:47.370
Why not? I'm God.

16:47.388 --> 16:49.502
Well, what do you want to do
about the breasts?

16:49.525 --> 16:53.061
Ah, take a couple out of the bin
we can't find matches for.

16:59.195 --> 17:02.271
I can't believe Dad killed Mom.

17:04.046 --> 17:05.672
Look, there he is!

17:05.708 --> 17:07.671
Dad, how could you?!

17:07.696 --> 17:11.002
Hey, Dad, if they put you in jail,
can we go in your room?

17:11.037 --> 17:14.521
Look, don't you kids buy any of this
for a second. Your father is innocent.

17:14.537 --> 17:15.780
Oh, he killed her.

17:15.807 --> 17:18.910
Just like the telephone killed
the telegraph sex business.

17:19.247 --> 17:21.623
Hey, baby. I bet you're hot. Stop.

17:21.737 --> 17:24.951
Describe to me what you're doing
to yourself right now. Stop.

17:26.095 --> 17:27.550
Oh, yeah.

17:28.244 --> 17:29.393
Oh, yeah...

17:29.415 --> 17:30.990
Oh, nasty!

17:32.295 --> 17:34.020
This trial is called to order.

17:34.067 --> 17:36.511
Defense Counsel, we will hear
your opening statement.

17:37.025 --> 17:38.970
Hey, everybody,

17:38.998 --> 17:40.850
today's the big day.

17:40.998 --> 17:42.432
That's all, Your Honor.

17:42.748 --> 17:43.942
Good. Good.

17:44.166 --> 17:46.160
Prosecutor, call your first witness.

17:46.258 --> 17:48.481
Peter called me right after
he killed my daughter

17:48.515 --> 17:50.633
- to tell me he killed my daughter.
- Really?

17:50.706 --> 17:52.500
Well, that is interesting.

17:52.545 --> 17:55.563
Yes, and as a favor to the court,
I've produced this simulation

17:55.587 --> 17:57.370
of how the killing transpired.

17:57.408 --> 18:00.622
I play Peter, and I hired an
Asian hooker to play my daughter.

18:02.328 --> 18:04.160
Lois, I'm fat and I'm stupid,

18:04.175 --> 18:07.331
and I fart at times that ruin
my father-in-law's social occasions,

18:07.346 --> 18:09.051
and that's why
I'm never invited to them.

18:09.068 --> 18:10.342
You pay me now?

18:14.756 --> 18:15.570
Chris,

18:15.608 --> 18:18.570
have you ever seen your father
do anything bad?

18:18.598 --> 18:20.562
Well, now that you mention it...

18:27.445 --> 18:28.483
Hey, Meg.

18:29.276 --> 18:30.450
Proud of you!

18:30.596 --> 18:33.163
Mr. Griffin, do you deny
killing your wife?

18:33.186 --> 18:35.601
Of course I deny it.
I loved my wife.

18:35.636 --> 18:37.710
And I certainly think
I'd remember killing her.

18:37.748 --> 18:38.821
Mr. Griffin,

18:38.846 --> 18:39.990
do you drink?

18:40.015 --> 18:41.473
I plead the fifth of Jack.

18:42.106 --> 18:44.171
No, no, I'm joking.
Yes, I drink.

18:44.268 --> 18:46.302
And have you ever struck your wife?

18:46.326 --> 18:49.952
Only in front of the kids to assert my
status as dominant male of the pride

18:49.976 --> 18:51.431
Are you a violent man?

18:51.446 --> 18:53.210
What are you, a wise guy?

18:53.228 --> 18:55.682
'Cause I know how to deal
with wise guys.

18:55.696 --> 18:58.393
- No further questions.
- You son of a bitch.

18:58.415 --> 19:00.743
If I had a gun on a boat, I'd shoot you.

19:04.205 --> 19:06.033
Mr. Foreman, how say you?

19:06.255 --> 19:10.200
We find Peter Griffin guilty of murder
in the first degree.

19:10.248 --> 19:11.810
- Oh, no!
- Oh, no!

19:11.825 --> 19:13.153
- Oh, no!
- Oh, no!

19:13.175 --> 19:15.062
- Oh, no!
- Oh, yeah!

19:21.215 --> 19:25.461
Okay, can I ask everyone to please
stop saying, "Oh, no" in this courtroom?

19:25.485 --> 19:28.062
'Cause the ******* Kool-Aid Guy's
gonna keep showing up.

19:28.296 --> 19:29.092
Thank you.

19:29.386 --> 19:30.501
Mr. Griffin,

19:30.748 --> 19:34.452
I hereby sentence you to life
imprisonment with no possibility of...

19:55.628 --> 19:56.560
Lois!

19:56.705 --> 19:58.012
You're alive!

19:58.288 --> 20:00.812
- Mom, you're alive!
- Oh, my gosh, Mom!

20:00.835 --> 20:03.461
Lois, my God, what happened?
We thought you were dead!

20:03.497 --> 20:06.051
Mom, we thought Dad killed you!

20:06.088 --> 20:07.962
No, he didn't, Chris.

20:08.276 --> 20:10.340
But someone tried to.

20:10.366 --> 20:12.060
Do you remember who it was?

20:12.085 --> 20:13.672
Yes, I do.

20:13.947 --> 20:15.483
It was Stewie!
