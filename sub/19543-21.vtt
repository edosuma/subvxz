WEBVTT

00:02.461 --> 00:07.501
Powerful foes muster on the
star of hope, Planet Namek.

00:09.343 --> 00:12.460
Kuririn anol Gohan have concealed
themselves for the time being,

00:12.554 --> 00:16.046
as they investigate the
activities of Freeza and his men.

00:18.143 --> 00:22.011
Meanwhile, on Earth,
Goku makes a complete recovery.

00:22.106 --> 00:24.688
Upon learning of the situation, he takes off.

00:27.986 --> 00:30.898
Dokkan Dokkan We're in luck

00:30.989 --> 00:34.072
Dokkan Dokkan Paradise

00:34.159 --> 00:38.198
The Genki Dama bursts away

00:38.288 --> 00:41.621
Go Go Let's do it

00:42.835 --> 00:48.626
There's a wriggling, mysterious energy

00:48.716 --> 00:54.586
I won't hold back, just you watch

00:54.680 --> 01:00.550
l'll protect you with my life

01:00.644 --> 01:06.731
Turn your courage to love into strength

01:06.817 --> 01:12.733
We'll overcome crises with carry-through spirit

01:12.823 --> 01:19.991
The tougher your opponent is,
the greater the excitement

01:21.331 --> 01:24.198
Dokkan Dokkan We're in luck

01:24.293 --> 01:27.501
Dokkan Dokkan Now's our chance

01:27.588 --> 01:33.128
Whooshing along on the lucky wind

01:33.218 --> 01:36.085
Dokkan Dokkan We're in luck

01:36.180 --> 01:39.343
Dokkan Dokkan Tomorrow, as well

01:39.433 --> 01:46.475
Your soul already knows the answer

01:46.565 --> 01:50.183
Dragon Soul!

01:52.821 --> 01:59.613
"Protect the Dragon Balls!
The Namekians' All-out Attack. "

02:08.836 --> 02:11.624
Ah, Goku-chan!

02:11.715 --> 02:12.875
Bulma's mommy.

02:12.966 --> 02:16.550
My, my, are you all better already?

02:16.637 --> 02:18.844
Just like you see.

02:18.931 --> 02:21.968
By the way, is the refit on the
spaceship I ordered done yet?

02:22.059 --> 02:26.473
Well, I'm not sure. It looked like
he was still working on something.

02:26.563 --> 02:31.853
Eep! Still?! Geez, what to do?

02:31.944 --> 02:34.606
He's in the inner yard. Come along.

02:36.824 --> 02:38.906
l have to say, who would have
thought that little Goku-chan

02:38.992 --> 02:40.823
would grow up to be so handsome?

02:40.911 --> 02:43.744
Say, let's have a date sometime, okay? Okay?

02:43.831 --> 02:48.325
|-| have to defeat the Saiyan, first.

02:48.418 --> 02:50.329
Aren't you the busy one?

02:50.420 --> 02:54.834
Oh, right, I found the most delicious
cake shop a little while ago.

02:54.925 --> 02:56.586
All thanks to you, Goku-Chan.

02:56.677 --> 03:00.135
If the Earth had been gone,
I wouldn't have been able to have any.

03:00.222 --> 03:02.133
I guess not.

03:02.224 --> 03:06.718
Dear! Goku-chan is here!

03:06.812 --> 03:09.519
l-ls that...

03:09.606 --> 03:12.439
...my spaceship?

03:12.526 --> 03:15.017
It's huge!

03:19.658 --> 03:22.240
Hey there, Goku. Better already?

03:22.327 --> 03:24.033
Mm-hmm, thanks to a senzu bean.

03:24.121 --> 03:27.158
This is mine, right? Is it true
you ain't finished with it yet?

03:27.249 --> 03:31.162
Mm-hmm, it's almost ready.
Come on inside and have a look.

03:31.253 --> 03:34.336
Well, I'll bring you something to drink, okay?

03:34.423 --> 03:36.084
Thanks.

03:39.469 --> 03:44.304
Awesome! I'm surprised that
tiny spaceship became all this!

03:44.391 --> 03:47.599
What can I say?
Everything is made to your order.

03:47.686 --> 03:50.849
I'll be able to do some decent training like this.

03:50.939 --> 03:55.148
I worked hard on this. Finding
the spaceship was hard enough,

03:55.235 --> 03:58.193
but it was all broken up in pieces.

03:58.280 --> 04:01.317
Luckily, all the important parts remained,

04:01.408 --> 04:03.615
but I had to rebuild almost all of it.

04:03.702 --> 04:06.284
My spaceship was in pieces?

04:06.371 --> 04:10.205
That's strange. I wonder if
I busted it when I was a kid.

04:10.292 --> 04:15.332
Well, I have to admit, Saiyan
science is absolutely fantastic.

04:15.422 --> 04:19.665
Huh? Um, where's the artificial gravity device?

04:19.760 --> 04:22.342
This is it over here.

04:22.429 --> 04:24.886
Oh, yeah? This thing?

04:24.973 --> 04:27.009
Let's see, this here is the switch.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.886
This here is the controller.

04:28.977 --> 04:33.220
It can put out a maximum of
1006s, just like you ordered,

04:33.315 --> 04:36.557
but that would be crazy,
even for you, wouldn't it?

04:36.652 --> 04:42.238
At 10065, if you weigh 60kg,
that would make you 6,000kg!

04:42.324 --> 04:44.736
That's six tons. Ordinarily, that would kill you.

04:44.826 --> 04:47.784
That's okay. Unless I train someplace like that,

04:47.871 --> 04:50.203
I ain't gonna beat the Saiyan.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.952
So, can't this thing fly yet?

04:53.043 --> 04:56.080
Oh, it will fly. To the ends of the universe.

04:56.171 --> 04:57.957
Huh? Then...

04:58.048 --> 05:02.462
The bathroom, kitchen, and
bedroom are down that ladder.

05:02.552 --> 05:05.134
So then, what part of it ain't done yet?

05:05.222 --> 05:08.760
I can't quite settle on the
location for the stereo speakers.

05:08.850 --> 05:11.136
As long as you're listening,
you'll want it to sound good, right?

05:11.228 --> 05:12.843
T-That's all?!

05:12.938 --> 05:15.475
When you say it ain't done yet,
that's all that's left?!

05:15.565 --> 05:18.432
That's all? In order to hear top sound,

05:18.527 --> 05:22.236
you have to think about
reverberation and such. It's quite tricky.

05:23.740 --> 05:25.355
Never mind about where to put the stereo!

05:25.450 --> 05:28.317
I'm in a hurry, sol need to take off right now!

05:28.412 --> 05:30.653
What are you in such a rush for?

05:30.747 --> 05:34.706
I got a message from Bulma!
In any event, l have to hurry!

05:36.044 --> 05:39.411
Hurry up and show me how to fly this thing!

05:39.506 --> 05:44.000
All right. So, you're sure about
the stereo placement, then?

05:44.094 --> 05:46.631
All the data has been inputted already.

05:46.722 --> 05:49.304
All you have to do is give
the button a little bop-bop,

05:49.391 --> 05:52.599
and you'll arrive at Planet Namek in six days.

05:52.686 --> 05:57.897
Six days? I can get there in
just six days? That's awesome!

05:59.234 --> 06:01.520
Is it true? Goku is here?

06:01.611 --> 06:06.071
Yes. He's looking at the
spaceship in the inner yard now.

06:06.158 --> 06:07.773
Oh, my!

06:12.622 --> 06:14.613
Oh, my goodness!

06:19.629 --> 06:23.713
Let's see, it's this button next, right?

06:43.570 --> 06:46.937
Considering how hastily I put that together,

06:47.032 --> 06:49.523
it really did fly.

06:49.618 --> 06:52.075
Huh? Where's Goku?

06:53.663 --> 06:56.905
He left in a big hurry.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.117
I hope he's sure about the stereo.

07:03.715 --> 07:07.128
Wow, this thing sure is fast, all right.

07:08.929 --> 07:10.715
l have to start training, right away.

07:10.806 --> 07:13.013
I'm glad I'll get there in six days,

07:13.100 --> 07:16.934
but I've gotta surpass that
Vegeta guy before then.

07:17.020 --> 07:18.885
Let's see, if I remember right,

07:18.980 --> 07:22.188
Kaio-sama said his planet was ’lO-times gravity.

07:22.275 --> 07:26.393
Maybe I should get accustomed
to 20-times, to start out with.

07:43.547 --> 07:46.459
That's kicking in, all right.

07:53.056 --> 07:56.548
We're close. We are close.
Surpress your Ki completely now.

07:56.643 --> 07:57.849
We'll walk up and approach from here.

07:57.936 --> 07:59.472
Right.

08:09.573 --> 08:11.780
They're on the other side of that cliff.

08:15.412 --> 08:17.698
That Ki is incredible!

08:23.211 --> 08:27.295
Those houses are just like
the spaceship we came here in.

08:27.382 --> 08:29.839
What are they up to?

08:29.926 --> 08:33.293
The other guys are one thing, but those three--

08:33.388 --> 08:37.006
especially the one in the middle,
inside that round vehicle--

08:37.100 --> 08:39.056
have a frighteningly strong Ki.

08:39.144 --> 08:41.135
H can tell.

08:44.274 --> 08:47.061
Look at what the two guys on his
side are holding in their hands!

08:47.152 --> 08:49.564
Those are Dragon Balls!

08:49.654 --> 08:52.270
Gigantic Dragon Balls!

08:56.328 --> 08:58.239
Is something the matter, Dodoria-san?

08:58.330 --> 09:02.619
No, there was just a small
power reading up on that cliff.

09:02.709 --> 09:07.043
It is gone now. It must have been
a small animal, or an insect.

09:13.637 --> 09:17.505
Holy crap! We were this close to being spotted!

09:21.228 --> 09:23.970
Freeza-sama, we have only found five of them.

09:24.064 --> 09:27.227
The others appear to be out at the moment.

09:27.317 --> 09:31.276
Come on out of there, unless you'd rather die.

09:40.121 --> 09:42.248
That looks just like Piccolo-san!

09:42.332 --> 09:44.869
l-lt's a Namekian!

09:51.967 --> 09:55.255
What are they planning
to do with the Namekian?

09:55.345 --> 09:58.382
Kuririn-san, are they all Saiyans?

09:58.473 --> 10:01.306
No, they aren't. They all have
the same battlewear on,

10:01.393 --> 10:03.509
but they aren't Saiyans. For one thing,

10:03.603 --> 10:07.562
Vegeta is supposed to be
the only Saiyan remaining.

10:07.649 --> 10:09.264
Not counting Goku or yourself.

10:09.359 --> 10:11.190
T-Then...

10:11.278 --> 10:14.441
Come to think of it, Goku's older
brother mentioned something.

10:14.531 --> 10:16.613
Our job is to travel around the universe,

10:16.700 --> 10:19.237
looking for planets that
have good environments,

10:19.327 --> 10:20.783
exterminating the people already living on them,

10:20.870 --> 10:23.862
and then selling them to aliens seeking
a suitable planet for a high price.

10:23.957 --> 10:27.666
It could be that he was pals with these guys.

10:29.045 --> 10:32.503
l have to admit, though, I don't
see Vegeta around anywhere.

10:32.590 --> 10:35.957
Is he off looking for
Dragon Balls someplace else?

10:41.641 --> 10:49.389
As you can see, I am collecting your
Dragon Balls. My name is Freeza.

10:49.482 --> 10:50.597
Now then,

10:50.692 --> 10:53.024
where are the others who were here?

10:53.111 --> 10:55.568
According to our search,

10:55.655 --> 10:58.772
there are supposed to be ten of you.

11:02.078 --> 11:05.787
Do you intend not to say anything?

11:05.874 --> 11:07.910
lwill kill you.

11:36.488 --> 11:39.480
Now, let me have your answer.

11:49.167 --> 11:53.536
Nuwainita hanitaemao moteleki koeto...

11:53.630 --> 11:57.748
Speak in language that we can
understand, as well, not in Namekian.

11:57.842 --> 12:00.754
I know that you can speak it.

12:00.845 --> 12:03.177
The others have left to work the farms.

12:03.264 --> 12:06.973
All that are left are us
older ones and the children.

12:07.060 --> 12:10.678
Yes, if I can have you answer
me straightforwardly like that,

12:10.772 --> 12:13.138
I will not do anything to you.

12:13.233 --> 12:16.851
Now then, let me have you
continue to answer my questions.

12:16.945 --> 12:19.652
Where is your Dragon Ball?

12:21.866 --> 12:24.482
I believe there is one here, as well.

12:24.577 --> 12:28.661
l-l don't know! We don't have anything like that!

12:28.748 --> 12:30.409
Dodoria-san...

12:30.500 --> 12:31.740
Yes, sir?

12:31.835 --> 12:34.417
The second Namekian we killed, as I recall,

12:34.504 --> 12:37.291
said something quite interesting, did he not?

12:37.382 --> 12:40.499
Yes, something about him not being
able to hand over his Dragon Ball,

12:40.593 --> 12:43.050
except to one judged to be a man of valor.

12:43.138 --> 12:46.676
Yes, yes. That man proved to be quite stubborn.

12:46.766 --> 12:50.634
We simply could not get
him to cooperate with us,

12:50.728 --> 12:54.641
until we killed one of them,
to serve as an example.

12:54.732 --> 12:58.600
Once we did, he told us all sorts of things.

12:58.695 --> 13:02.813
That the Grand Elder of this world
created the seven Dragon Balls;

13:02.907 --> 13:06.445
that the seven elders each held
one of them with great care;

13:06.536 --> 13:10.654
and that each of them would ask to
match wits, extend tests of strength,

13:10.748 --> 13:12.830
and discuss the reasons for one's wish.

13:12.917 --> 13:16.455
Then, once one is judged to be
a man of valor by each elder,

13:16.546 --> 13:21.586
one would finally be able to obtain them.

13:21.676 --> 13:25.635
However, even though I tried
to do as was asked of me,

13:25.722 --> 13:29.214
l was told that he would never
hand it over to me, you see?

13:29.309 --> 13:33.678
So I could not help myself but to kill him.

13:33.771 --> 13:38.185
As such, it took a great deal
of effort to locate the first one.

13:38.276 --> 13:42.736
The next three were quite easy.
Everyone was quite accommodating.

13:42.822 --> 13:44.437
Hmph, | see.

13:44.532 --> 13:46.739
So that's the deal.

13:46.826 --> 13:50.034
A-Accommodating, you say?!

13:50.121 --> 13:52.157
You are lying!

13:52.248 --> 13:54.409
Yeah! There's no way the other elders

13:54.501 --> 13:56.992
handed them over to you without any protest!

13:57.086 --> 14:01.125
I beg to differ. Once we did this,
they quickly became amenable.

14:01.216 --> 14:03.628
Zarbon-san, if you would show them.

14:03.718 --> 14:05.254
Yes, sir.

14:17.899 --> 14:19.639
Why, you...!

14:19.734 --> 14:21.440
Stop!

14:48.263 --> 14:50.219
W-What fiends!

14:50.306 --> 14:52.262
H-How awful!

14:52.350 --> 14:55.592
Gohan, control your Ki! They'll know we're here!

14:55.687 --> 14:57.052
But if we don't do something...

14:57.146 --> 15:00.764
I mean, you want to bring Piccolo
and everyone else back to life, right?

15:00.858 --> 15:03.770
There's no way we can take on someone like that.

15:03.861 --> 15:06.773
If we show ourselves now, we'd only die in vain.

15:08.533 --> 15:15.075
What do you say? Are you feeling
a little more compliant now? Hmm?

15:15.164 --> 15:18.952
What is your purpose in
collecting the Dragon Balls?

15:19.043 --> 15:21.705
Oh, it is quite a frivolous little wish.

15:21.796 --> 15:25.334
l was thinking of gaining eternal life.

15:25.425 --> 15:28.041
He's what?! Then, what about Vegeta?

15:28.136 --> 15:30.593
H-He's out for eternal life, too.

15:30.680 --> 15:33.296
Do you suppose they aren't friends with Vegeta?

15:33.391 --> 15:34.972
I don't know.

15:35.059 --> 15:39.803
The likes of you will get the
Dragon Ball over my dead body!

15:41.190 --> 15:43.055
So you are saying you
would rather choose death

15:43.151 --> 15:45.984
than give your Dragon Ball to me? | see.

15:46.070 --> 15:51.656
The people of this planet seem
to be very stubborn, indeed.

15:51.743 --> 15:52.949
But then...

15:53.036 --> 15:56.369
...can you still remain stubborn
after the death of those children?

15:56.456 --> 15:58.367
W-What?!

16:04.047 --> 16:06.663
You'd even go after children?!

16:14.474 --> 16:17.216
There's a strong battle power.

16:21.147 --> 16:23.183
Freeza-sama, over there!

16:27.779 --> 16:30.441
Oh, you've come, have you?

16:33.785 --> 16:34.991
The Namekians!

16:35.078 --> 16:36.864
They're coming to help!

16:44.629 --> 16:48.213
Damn, that ill foreboding I felt proved true!

16:48.299 --> 16:49.914
We cannot have this, can we?

16:50.009 --> 16:53.547
I was finally about to have the
Dragon Ball brought out, too.

16:53.638 --> 16:56.505
Imagine, you interrupting your work,

16:56.599 --> 16:59.136
so that you could come here and be killed.

16:59.227 --> 17:02.094
I see now. The rumors of
people attacking the villages

17:02.188 --> 17:05.555
and stealing the Dragon Balls are true, are they?

17:07.276 --> 17:10.233
You'll pay for this!

17:10.320 --> 17:14.530
How dare you trample
the peace of Planet Namek?!

17:14.617 --> 17:21.034
Ho, you intend to fight us?
How great is your battle power?

17:21.124 --> 17:22.159
Dodoria-san?

17:22.250 --> 17:24.957
Yes, sir, I will check.

17:34.137 --> 17:38.380
Please do not be disappointed.
All three are in the vicinity of 1,000.

17:39.851 --> 17:42.934
There is no need for us to even fight them.

17:43.020 --> 17:46.183
So that's it. I now understand how they are able

17:46.274 --> 17:49.482
to so precisely locate our few
villages, which dot the land

17:49.569 --> 17:52.231
across the vastness of Planet Namek.

17:52.321 --> 17:55.734
They are able to search, using those devices!

17:57.076 --> 17:58.316
How laughable!

17:58.411 --> 18:02.745
You want to tangle with us,
with a battle power of 1,000?! Eh?!

18:02.832 --> 18:06.950
He's wrong. Those three are
just suppressing their Ki.

18:07.044 --> 18:09.626
Don't these guys even know that much?

18:09.714 --> 18:12.956
The Saiyans were surprised by that, as well, huh?

18:13.050 --> 18:15.427
Let 'em have it!

19:01.682 --> 19:05.925
What is this? That's what you
call a battle power of 1,000?

19:09.732 --> 19:13.645
What's going on here?
All three have increased to 3,000!

19:21.661 --> 19:24.118
Well, well, they are pretty good, are they not?

19:24.205 --> 19:26.287
I get it. The Namekians are a race

19:26.374 --> 19:28.865
that are able to control their battle power.

19:28.960 --> 19:31.702
Such is a very rare type.

19:31.796 --> 19:33.787
All right. Including his,

19:33.881 --> 19:37.590
there are only three of those
devices that remain unbroken.

19:37.677 --> 19:39.087
Children,

19:39.178 --> 19:41.794
stand away from me.

19:41.889 --> 19:43.754
Quickly!

19:43.850 --> 19:44.965
Dodoria-san...

19:45.059 --> 19:46.720
Yes, sir.

19:46.811 --> 19:49.723
You guys are pathetic.

19:51.107 --> 19:54.474
You're going to trouble me with this, are you?

19:57.196 --> 19:59.858
May I take care of all three of them?

19:59.949 --> 20:01.940
Feel free.

20:07.540 --> 20:11.124
Y-You bastard! Did you really
think you could defeat me

20:11.210 --> 20:14.623
with such a petty technique?

20:20.761 --> 20:25.130
Oh, no! He was going after the Scouters!

20:25.224 --> 20:26.430
Scouters?

20:26.517 --> 20:30.385
T-Those devices that can tell an
opponent's strength and location!

20:30.479 --> 20:33.937
So that's it! Then they can't
determine the precise location

20:34.025 --> 20:36.641
of the Dragon Balls after all!

20:36.736 --> 20:39.443
They use those Scouter things
to look for the Namekians,

20:39.530 --> 20:40.940
and then strong-arm them!

20:41.032 --> 20:42.818
Which is why, when the
old-timer there figured it out,

20:42.909 --> 20:45.491
he destroyed all of their Scouters!

20:47.997 --> 20:51.080
Why, you...!

20:54.128 --> 20:56.961
I—I'll kill them all!

21:04.305 --> 21:07.012
I'll kill them all!!

21:07.099 --> 21:11.468
I'll kill every last one of them!

21:12.521 --> 21:14.933
Elder! Look out!

21:16.776 --> 21:19.984
The elder launches a quick-witted attack!

21:20.071 --> 21:24.440
However, it also sparks the enemy's anger!

21:24.533 --> 21:29.778
Can Gohan and Kuririn do nothing but look on?

21:31.916 --> 21:34.828
Yeah! Break! Care! Break! As hard as you can

21:34.919 --> 21:39.413
Fly away into the boundless skies

21:39.507 --> 21:42.340
We'll hitch a ride on the jet stream,

21:42.426 --> 21:45.463
and zip away to wherever we want

21:45.554 --> 21:47.806
Being a daredevil is the best

21:47.890 --> 21:51.223
Let's go tip-top! All right?

21:51.310 --> 21:57.101
This eye-opening blue Earth of ours

21:57.191 --> 22:03.278
is our irreplaceable world,
and we're not giving it up

22:04.657 --> 22:07.615
Blast offa Kamehame-Ha

22:07.702 --> 22:10.865
You were born

22:10.955 --> 22:16.575
to protect the world in these uncertain times

22:16.669 --> 22:19.581
Yeah! Break! Care! Break! As hard as you can

22:19.672 --> 22:22.789
Go at it full power

22:22.883 --> 22:26.842
Hope is my weapon,

22:26.929 --> 22:30.171
so believe in the future

22:34.812 --> 22:36.768
Heya! I'm Goku!

22:36.856 --> 22:40.599
Six days until I arrive. Don't do
anything crazy, Kuririn and Gohan!

22:40.693 --> 22:42.183
Keep it under control for now, Gohan!

22:42.278 --> 22:44.018
If they spot us, we're done for!

22:44.113 --> 22:46.775
No way! I'm going to belt those guys!

22:46.866 --> 22:49.824
You dumbass! Run! Run away!

22:49.910 --> 22:51.775
Next time on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

22:51.871 --> 22:55.489
"Dodoria's Hectic Chase of Terror!
A Truth Revealed to Vegeta. "

22:55.583 --> 22:58.666
I can't just sit still!
