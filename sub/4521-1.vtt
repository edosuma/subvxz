WEBVTT

01:09.988 --> 01:11.739
Mama...?

01:19.914 --> 01:21.624
Mama?

01:24.961 --> 01:27.589
- Mama?
- Hi.

01:27.755 --> 01:30.300
Are you lost?
You wanna be best friends?

01:31.759 --> 01:33.428
Fr... iend?

01:33.595 --> 01:37.140
- Friend?
- We'll start slow. What's your name?

01:40.435 --> 01:42.687
Wha-yer-name.

01:42.854 --> 01:44.897
No, no, no. What's your name?

01:45.064 --> 01:46.399
You-name!

01:47.025 --> 01:49.027
You-name? That's your name?

01:49.402 --> 01:50.903
You-name!

01:52.238 --> 01:53.906
Okaaay...

01:54.073 --> 01:56.534
I've got my work out out here.

02:00.455 --> 02:02.749
Come on, honeybun.

03:31.337 --> 03:35.466
YELLOWBIRD

04:00.283 --> 04:02.118
Look, it ain't complicated.

04:02.285 --> 04:05.705
You play nice,
or I'll bust your teeth

04:05.872 --> 04:08.541
until you look like pigeon puke.
I'll rip

04:08.708 --> 04:11.544
your feathers off
till you cry to your mommy!

04:13.588 --> 04:14.380
Not bad!

04:14.547 --> 04:18.301
You had good volume, conviction.
But watch what you say.

04:18.468 --> 04:20.845
I'll bust your teeth? Look at me.

04:21.012 --> 04:24.390
Do I have teeth?
No, not one. Ahhhh! No teeth!

04:24.557 --> 04:26.100
I'll never get it right.

04:26.267 --> 04:28.394
Hey, this is for your protection.

04:28.561 --> 04:30.938
I just don't feel comfortable, Bug.

04:31.105 --> 04:36.110
Come on! You always say
you're scared of all the dangers!

04:36.277 --> 04:39.071
The rabid raccoons,
the killer hamsters...

04:39.238 --> 04:43.451
Yeah or gerbils with sharp teeth
or super violent

04:43.618 --> 04:45.411
bloodthirsty groundhogs.

04:46.412 --> 04:49.290
Hey, I've heard stories!

04:49.874 --> 04:52.668
I get it. You're terrified,
it's adorable.

04:52.835 --> 04:54.712
I'm trying to toughen you up!

04:55.087 --> 04:57.715
Tough just isn't me, Bug.

04:57.882 --> 05:00.927
You say you want to get out
and see the world.

05:01.093 --> 05:03.471
But you'll never go out that door!

05:04.722 --> 05:07.767
Look, I can't go right now.

05:07.934 --> 05:10.436
Besides, there's plenty to do here.

05:10.603 --> 05:12.814
What about a game of "Big Face"?

05:12.980 --> 05:16.609
Biiiiiig face... little face!

05:17.401 --> 05:18.778
Big face!

05:18.945 --> 05:20.404
Little face!

05:21.155 --> 05:23.908
Or maybe a little "Cardboard Roll"?

05:28.996 --> 05:30.122
You're a bird, fella,

05:30.289 --> 05:31.707
a bird.

05:31.874 --> 05:34.961
A bird flies,
it glides, it goes "ka-kawvvw"!

05:35.503 --> 05:37.630
You could see the whole world!

05:37.797 --> 05:39.632
The oceans, the mountains,

05:39.799 --> 05:42.051
the buffaloes!
The giant ostriches

05:42.218 --> 05:44.178
that wiggle their behinds like this!

05:45.137 --> 05:46.848
The baboon-oceroses,

05:47.014 --> 05:49.267
the orangu-possum!

05:59.151 --> 06:03.656
It's really out there, you know.
Just like in the pictures.

06:04.031 --> 06:06.617
Sure you don't want
to see it for real?

06:38.107 --> 06:39.859
Good morning, everyone.

06:40.026 --> 06:42.612
Come on, children, settle down now.

06:42.778 --> 06:45.531
Everyone on their branches!
Quickly, Anton.

06:46.240 --> 06:49.744
Lisa, would you please hang up
the astronomy chart?

06:49.911 --> 06:51.829
Yes, miss!

06:52.705 --> 06:55.625
Just you wait,
I'll get called on again.

06:55.791 --> 07:00.254
If you'd learned the lesson,
you'd have nothing to worry about, Max.

07:00.421 --> 07:04.342
That's why you fail Night Sky Studies,
but get an "A" in Goofing Off.

07:04.508 --> 07:07.970
Now try to remember.
Which planet lies to the East of Saturn?

07:08.763 --> 07:10.848
Miss Delf! Miss Delf!

07:11.015 --> 07:12.642
Um... Jupiturn?

07:12.808 --> 07:16.896
- Why not Plu-turn? Or Mercuturn?
- Shut your beak.

07:17.063 --> 07:20.149
- Who cares about the stars?
- If you don't memorize

07:20.316 --> 07:25.071
where the stars are at your age,
it'll be too late, you supercute

07:25.237 --> 07:28.991
doodooheads! Learn it, be confident.
The sky won't fall

07:29.158 --> 07:30.576
on your head, you know!

07:34.038 --> 07:36.624
It's only a leaf, kids! Don't panic.

07:36.791 --> 07:40.670
What? I'm not panicking.
Who's panicking?

07:40.836 --> 07:45.341
I know what it is. It's a leaf
from a Cyclobalanopsis Lithocarpus.

07:45.508 --> 07:47.843
You're a Litho-Crap-us!

07:48.010 --> 07:49.595
"Carpus!"

07:49.762 --> 07:52.723
- How did it fall on you?
- From above.

07:52.890 --> 07:54.600
- You didn't shake the branches?
- No.

07:54.767 --> 07:59.772
Nobody pulled on it? Shook it?
Tickled it? Wiggled it? Hopped around?

08:02.483 --> 08:05.528
OK, lesson's over for today, kids.

08:06.028 --> 08:08.823
Wow, thank you, Leaf!

08:28.092 --> 08:29.427
Dad?

08:33.639 --> 08:36.433
Already? Nobody pulled on it?

08:36.600 --> 08:40.354
Shook it? Tickled it?
Wiggled it? Hopped around?

08:42.398 --> 08:45.109
That settles it.
Autumn's on its way.

08:45.276 --> 08:47.987
Yes! We're going to Africa!
Awesome!

08:48.154 --> 08:49.947
Let's go tell the others!

08:52.283 --> 08:53.659
Where is Africa?

08:55.703 --> 08:57.788
And... where are we?

08:59.582 --> 09:01.500
Wow, hold on...

09:02.084 --> 09:05.212
Couldn't we go someplace...
I don't know...

09:05.379 --> 09:07.590
A little closer?

09:07.757 --> 09:10.259
Off to Africa! Time to fly!

09:13.929 --> 09:17.224
Come on, little bro!
You can practice during the trip.

09:23.564 --> 09:25.983
Janet! It's autumn! We're outta here!

09:26.150 --> 09:27.818
Oh, already?

09:27.985 --> 09:30.696
Michka! Get a move on. We're leaving!

09:30.863 --> 09:34.492
What? So soon?
But we're not ready yet!

09:36.202 --> 09:41.707
Anton, I'm sick of tidying up your toys!
Finish molting and stop clowning around!

09:41.874 --> 09:46.087
I gotta molt,
I can't wear this color for autumn!

09:46.670 --> 09:49.006
Mom, Anton's annoying me.

09:59.809 --> 10:03.646
Darius! So we're leaving?
Why am I the last to know?

10:03.813 --> 10:08.484
I'm next in line, your
second-in-command, wing-man, back-up.

10:08.651 --> 10:11.237
I should be the first to know!

10:11.403 --> 10:13.072
Well now, Karl,

10:13.239 --> 10:16.283
you're always saying
you've got a 6th sense!

10:16.450 --> 10:18.577
I thought you knew already.

10:19.411 --> 10:21.705
OK, OK! That's very funny.

10:21.872 --> 10:24.792
"You're always saying
you've got a 6th sense"!

10:28.254 --> 10:29.505
Daddy?

10:30.631 --> 10:31.632
Everything OK?

10:31.799 --> 10:35.970
- What? Oh, sure.
- Are you worried about the iron birds?

10:36.137 --> 10:40.057
Sometimes I feel
that the seasons are all out of kilter.

10:40.224 --> 10:43.936
But I'm sure
that's just my old bird brain!

10:44.520 --> 10:46.313
But don't you worry,

10:46.480 --> 10:50.317
it's going to be a wonderful trip,
just like every year.

11:12.548 --> 11:14.216
Score!

11:15.134 --> 11:18.470
Everybody goes crazy!

11:23.184 --> 11:24.226
OK!

11:25.311 --> 11:26.437
Come on!

11:26.604 --> 11:28.397
My shot.

11:31.567 --> 11:32.610
Oh no!

11:35.738 --> 11:37.948
Oh, sorry, honeybun!

11:38.115 --> 11:41.744
I didn't mean to hit it so far.
Now you'll have to get it.

11:41.911 --> 11:43.662
It's no big deal...

11:43.954 --> 11:46.165
- Ow, ow...
- What's the matter?

11:46.332 --> 11:49.335
Boy, does that hurt!
I sprained a mandible

11:49.835 --> 11:51.962
or twisted an antenna...

11:52.963 --> 11:55.049
Legs... paralyzed!

11:55.216 --> 11:57.343
Oh, you've gotta get that acorn!

11:57.509 --> 12:01.222
But... you shot it really far out there.

12:01.764 --> 12:04.475
You! Valiant friend! Don't abandon us.

12:04.975 --> 12:06.227
You're our only hope.

12:07.186 --> 12:09.063
We can play with something else.

12:09.230 --> 12:11.690
Never! It came
from my great-grandmother!

12:11.857 --> 12:14.526
Didn't you say
you found it in the forest?

12:14.693 --> 12:18.822
It's been in the family for generations!
Please, honeybunny!

12:18.989 --> 12:20.699
I'm begging you!

12:22.451 --> 12:24.245
Oh, the pain!

12:24.411 --> 12:28.499
OK! I'll do it.
Just stop calling me bunny, OK?

12:48.185 --> 12:51.397
I'm only doing this
because we're best friends.

12:53.899 --> 12:55.442
Good.

13:23.887 --> 13:25.097
Darius...

13:25.264 --> 13:29.184
- Will we really fly across the sea?
- Absolutely!

13:29.560 --> 13:31.186
And the desert too?

13:31.353 --> 13:34.231
Yes, Lisa. And the desert too.

13:35.649 --> 13:39.862
Now go and get plenty to eat.
To stock up for the long journey.

13:40.029 --> 13:41.280
This is the one time

13:41.447 --> 13:44.950
I'll let you stuff yourselves.
Go on.

13:45.242 --> 13:46.827
Sounds good to me!

13:51.206 --> 13:52.708
Oh yes...

13:53.000 --> 13:57.671
Once we get there, we'll find
a separate bush for the two of you.

13:58.130 --> 14:01.091
Young lovebirds need their privacy.

14:01.258 --> 14:02.676
- We're not...
- Dad!

14:03.302 --> 14:08.182
What are you saying? Did you eat a bad
blueberry? Willy and I aren't together.

14:08.349 --> 14:10.893
You kids must be as blind as bats!

14:11.060 --> 14:14.605
Only you haven't noticed
you're made for each other.

14:14.772 --> 14:17.566
It's as plain as the beak on my face!

14:17.733 --> 14:18.984
Dad!

14:19.193 --> 14:20.444
Oops...

14:27.785 --> 14:29.953
I'll be back shortly, lovebirds.

14:30.120 --> 14:32.623
Get everything ready for our departure.

14:32.790 --> 14:34.833
I'm counting on you.

16:49.718 --> 16:52.054
One foot in front of the other.

16:52.221 --> 16:55.766
Keep walking... get the acorn...
What is that?

16:55.933 --> 16:58.477
A radioactive mutant coyote!

16:58.644 --> 16:59.978
No, just branches.

17:01.021 --> 17:04.148
OK, let's not panic.
There is nothing dangerous out here,

17:04.691 --> 17:06.318
just trees.

17:06.652 --> 17:11.448
Just big,
twisty black trees with claws!

17:11.615 --> 17:13.867
Right! Focus!

17:14.034 --> 17:17.704
No acorn left behind!
Get that little soldier.

17:17.871 --> 17:19.205
Hey, little guy!

17:19.373 --> 17:21.959
We're gonna get you out of here.

17:23.335 --> 17:25.212
What was I scared of?

17:27.339 --> 17:30.217
Red alert! Abandon acorn!

17:39.560 --> 17:41.770
Please... Somebody...

17:41.937 --> 17:43.272
Help!

17:43.438 --> 17:46.942
- That's just what I was gonna say.
- Help me!

17:47.109 --> 17:50.445
Help you? Help me!

17:50.612 --> 17:54.241
Please, somebody! Please help!

17:55.075 --> 17:59.496
I can't, sorry!
I... I got some dust in my eye!

17:59.663 --> 18:02.708
- I'm allergic to pollen!
- Are you still there?

18:03.125 --> 18:04.209
No!

18:04.626 --> 18:07.754
OK, I am, but listen... I'm uh...

18:08.255 --> 18:10.841
. I-m gonna go get help!
- DON'T go!

18:11.008 --> 18:12.843
I'm begging you! Hurry!

18:13.010 --> 18:15.220
OK, but let's do this quick

18:15.387 --> 18:17.598
and you better not be bleeding!

18:17.764 --> 18:19.391
I cannot stand blood!

18:38.744 --> 18:39.995
Sir?

18:41.872 --> 18:44.124
Well, you don't look so good...

18:46.168 --> 18:49.171
You gotta help me, little fella...

18:49.338 --> 18:53.216
- I don't have much time left.
- OK, but we can't stay here.

18:53.383 --> 18:56.678
My family has to leave
before winter comes.

18:57.220 --> 18:59.806
It's a matter of life and death!

19:00.140 --> 19:02.976
We'll get you home
and you'll be just fine!

19:03.143 --> 19:04.269
Man, you're heavy!

19:05.187 --> 19:08.690
If my children don't leave
for Africa right away,

19:08.857 --> 19:10.442
they'll all die!

19:10.609 --> 19:15.822
You want me to help? We just met
and I'm not exactly the hero type.

19:16.448 --> 19:19.576
You've got to go find Karl, my nephew!

19:20.118 --> 19:22.871
He's the only one
who can get them to Africa.

19:23.497 --> 19:24.790
Africa?

19:25.707 --> 19:30.045
Karl. If I'm still alive
in 10 minutes, I'll tell him.

19:30.212 --> 19:32.881
- How much do you weigh?
- He must change

19:33.048 --> 19:38.804
the usual route to avoid the iron birds!
They're all over our route this year.

19:39.471 --> 19:41.890
Just a suggestion: Give up carbs.

19:42.057 --> 19:43.392
The iron birds,

19:43.558 --> 19:45.977
promise me you'll tell Karl!

19:46.144 --> 19:47.145
Yeah, sure.

19:47.729 --> 19:48.897
Promise me!

19:49.064 --> 19:51.775
- I promise.
- He's got to go the way

19:51.942 --> 19:55.195
of the pointed rocks,
then the river with the fireflies,

19:55.362 --> 19:58.448
then change directions till the sea.

19:58.615 --> 20:01.076
Karl's got a 6th sense...

20:01.243 --> 20:04.746
if he can just learn
to hear it, to follow it.

20:04.913 --> 20:07.165
This is a lot of information.

20:07.332 --> 20:09.543
Can you repeat the first part?

20:09.710 --> 20:11.753
You must tell them!

20:11.920 --> 20:13.463
OK, OK! "Karl," "pointed rocks,"

20:13.630 --> 20:17.884
"fireflies," "6th sense," I got it.
Now let's get out of here!

20:26.059 --> 20:27.060
Daddy!

20:27.811 --> 20:29.271
Daddy! Where are you?

20:29.438 --> 20:34.359
Something's wrong. He was only supposed
to be gone for a couple of minutes.

20:36.820 --> 20:37.612
Over here!

20:37.988 --> 20:40.407
No! Daddy!

20:48.832 --> 20:50.041
Daddy?

20:57.632 --> 20:58.884
Daddy...

20:59.843 --> 21:03.889
Listen to the yellow bird...

21:04.055 --> 21:05.432
What?

21:05.849 --> 21:08.894
- Yellow... bird...
- Daddy?

21:12.606 --> 21:14.065
No!

21:16.443 --> 21:17.778
Daddy...

22:03.448 --> 22:04.533
Hey! You!

22:05.075 --> 22:06.493
Wait!

22:06.660 --> 22:09.204
Who are you? What were you doing here?

22:09.371 --> 22:11.039
I... I...

22:13.375 --> 22:14.626
I'm sorry.

22:14.793 --> 22:16.378
Karl, what do we do?

22:17.087 --> 22:18.505
Karl?

22:19.798 --> 22:21.508
Are you Karl?

22:21.675 --> 22:24.803
- Ladybug?
- Are you going to Africa

22:24.970 --> 22:25.804
for the winter?

22:25.971 --> 22:28.849
Yes. But without Darius...

22:29.015 --> 22:31.768
Without Darius?
You're gonna need him!

22:31.935 --> 22:36.481
What? Need him? For what?
Need him for what?

22:36.648 --> 22:40.402
- To get you to Africa!
- OK, OK!

22:40.569 --> 22:43.363
Listen, buggy,
we're a pretty tight group.

22:43.530 --> 22:48.326
We've been through a lot without
dragging along a skinny yellow bird.

22:48.952 --> 22:51.162
Wait a minute. "Yellow bird?"

22:51.329 --> 22:53.665
Pay no attention to the ladybug.

22:53.832 --> 22:55.834
She lives alone, she's crazy.

22:56.001 --> 23:00.213
It's true. This guy is
the only one who knows the new route.

23:00.630 --> 23:02.257
The new route?

23:02.424 --> 23:06.344
You can't take last year's route
because of the iron birds.

23:06.511 --> 23:08.889
Only he knows how to avoid them!

23:09.347 --> 23:12.309
- Iron birds?!
- This is insane.

23:12.475 --> 23:15.604
We are listening to a raving insect!

23:15.770 --> 23:19.524
- Did you speak to my father?
- Yes. I tried to help him.

23:19.691 --> 23:22.277
It was your father's final wish.

23:22.903 --> 23:25.322
Could you excuse us for a moment?

23:26.239 --> 23:29.826
Are you crazy?
Karl is supposed to lead them.

23:29.993 --> 23:31.953
Not if only you know the way.

23:32.120 --> 23:33.580
I don't know the way!

23:33.747 --> 23:37.417
Sure you do!
Just follow the old man's clues.

23:37.584 --> 23:39.794
Pointed rocks, fireflies...
It's easy.

23:39.961 --> 23:42.756
You have as much instinct
as any other bird.

23:42.923 --> 23:45.675
You left the house. Just keep going!

23:45.842 --> 23:47.761
Just... keep on... going?

23:47.928 --> 23:51.723
It's your chance, honeybun,
to be a part of a real flock.

23:51.890 --> 23:53.850
You'll never be alone out there.

23:54.017 --> 23:55.852
But what about you?

23:56.019 --> 23:57.979
I can't leave you behind.

23:58.146 --> 24:02.525
This has all been very weird.
So, if you can give me the new route,

24:02.692 --> 24:04.527
we'll get out of here.

24:04.945 --> 24:07.072
Darius told me the way.

24:07.530 --> 24:08.490
Yes!

24:08.657 --> 24:12.035
And he made me promise

24:12.202 --> 24:13.578
to take you there.

24:13.745 --> 24:16.539
Impossible. I'm the next in line.

24:16.706 --> 24:18.708
A promise is a promise.

24:24.172 --> 24:25.382
Come on quick!

24:25.548 --> 24:27.008
Let's fly!

24:44.526 --> 24:46.653
Oh no! Help!

24:46.820 --> 24:49.698
- Fleck!
- Willy!

25:03.044 --> 25:04.421
No, that way!

25:12.929 --> 25:14.389
Fleck!

25:17.934 --> 25:20.520
Hey you! Wait for us!

25:21.062 --> 25:22.897
Fleck, you're alright?

25:23.064 --> 25:26.526
Thanks, buddy. You saved his life.

25:26.943 --> 25:29.988
Hi! I'm Willy,
the worried older brother.

25:30.155 --> 25:32.991
My father placed us
under your wing.

25:33.158 --> 25:35.035
So, which way do we go now?

25:35.577 --> 25:37.996
Let's all just calm down here!

25:38.163 --> 25:41.082
Don't listen to a stranger.
Why change...

25:41.249 --> 25:45.003
Karl, don't forget Dad's last words:
"Listen to the yellow bird".

25:45.170 --> 25:49.674
Right! Darius says "yellow bird".
<i>2</i> minutes later, a yellow bird shows up!

25:49.841 --> 25:51.426
This is nonsense!

25:51.593 --> 25:53.970
Darius talked to you?
What did he say?

25:54.304 --> 25:56.931
Well, he made me promise

25:57.098 --> 26:00.018
to take you to Africa.
- He said that?

26:00.185 --> 26:02.437
Yeah, he did. Crazy, right?

26:02.604 --> 26:05.148
Because I've got a 6th sense.

26:05.315 --> 26:11.279
A 6th sense?! Ridiculous!
I'm the only one with a 6th sense.

26:11.446 --> 26:12.989
The pointed rocks!

26:13.156 --> 26:15.533
The pointed rocks! It's this way!

26:16.117 --> 26:18.578
Apparently you're not the only one!

26:19.788 --> 26:22.916
Hold on!
The stars aren't even lined up!

26:23.083 --> 26:25.710
That's bad luck!
We're against the wind!

26:25.877 --> 26:29.255
And why isn't anyone listening to me?

26:32.967 --> 26:34.594
Amazing!

26:35.136 --> 26:39.599
It's the pointed rocks,
just like he said! Wow!

26:48.483 --> 26:51.820
Something is telling me
we have to find...

26:51.986 --> 26:54.781
a river with fireflies.

26:54.948 --> 26:57.826
- Yep, I'm getting a vibe.
- A vibe?

26:58.243 --> 27:01.538
I'm getting a vibe myself.
A different vibe.

27:03.665 --> 27:05.041
Go on!

27:05.750 --> 27:10.004
Fly away, honeybun.
I did it. I'm so proud.

27:10.672 --> 27:13.216
Wait... Who'll be my best friend now?

28:14.569 --> 28:18.239
May the migration go smoothly,
may the wind be at our backs,

28:18.406 --> 28:23.161
may the sun shine, not too warm,
keep the northerly breeze not too cold.

28:23.328 --> 28:26.873
If you set the temperature
at 65 degrees, that'd be nice.

28:27.040 --> 28:31.085
Hey, Maggie, are you praying
or giving us the weather forecast?

29:00.990 --> 29:03.743
Let's see,
river with the fireflies...

29:03.910 --> 29:06.454
River with the fireflies...

29:06.621 --> 29:08.873
This is crazy. Crazy, right?

29:09.040 --> 29:12.085
We should just take last year's route,

29:12.252 --> 29:14.796
which is in the opposite direction!

29:14.963 --> 29:17.173
And come across the iron birds?

29:17.340 --> 29:22.178
Get torn to shreds? Cut into pieces
with flesh like confetti...

29:22.762 --> 29:24.806
We get the message, Janet.

29:24.973 --> 29:28.434
Do you think
these iron birds really exist?

29:28.601 --> 29:29.602
Well, of course.

29:29.769 --> 29:35.066
Thank Birdness, you popped up with
the plan to avoid them, eh, mastermind?

29:36.651 --> 29:39.529
Oh, "mastermind",
that's such a strong word.

29:39.696 --> 29:44.409
Well, if Darius picked you...
Where you fly, we follow.

29:44.575 --> 29:46.119
Well, yes, ma'am.

29:46.286 --> 29:50.790
You can call me Janet!
I'm the mother of that stubborn Karl.

29:51.624 --> 29:55.169
I'm also Delf's aunt
and I'm married to this one.

29:55.336 --> 29:58.006
Michka. Delighted.
What's your name?

29:58.381 --> 30:02.176
Well, uh, Ladybug calls me honeybun.

30:02.343 --> 30:04.512
Honeybun? No, your real name?

30:04.846 --> 30:07.098
Well, I don't really have one.

30:07.890 --> 30:09.809
That's it! Fireflies!

30:10.310 --> 30:13.771
It really is a river of fireflies.

30:14.188 --> 30:16.858
- Hey look.
- See?

30:17.025 --> 30:19.110
He does know the way!

30:19.610 --> 30:22.405
You know, I wanted to thank you,
leaving your house

30:22.572 --> 30:25.325
and friends behind for us.
It's very brave.

30:25.825 --> 30:29.120
- Brave? Me? Oh, well...
- Yes, you are.

30:29.287 --> 30:33.082
For a little bird, a non-migrator,
this is a big journey.

30:33.249 --> 30:35.960
You got that right.
Africa is, what...

30:36.377 --> 30:38.921
at least 3 or 4 hours from here.

30:39.088 --> 30:41.424
You're funny! And a real optimist!

30:41.591 --> 30:44.886
You need to be,
when you think about all the dangers.

30:45.053 --> 30:49.265
Right, right. All those dangers
just waiting, huh?

30:49.432 --> 30:51.392
Dangerously lurking.

30:51.976 --> 30:56.022
Ha! Hilarious...
Maybe we should take a pit stop.

30:56.189 --> 31:00.151
A little break sounds good.
Gotta think of the old-timers!

31:00.318 --> 31:02.612
My wings don't flap as well now!

31:02.779 --> 31:05.156
And I'm getting a little hungry.

31:06.074 --> 31:08.034
You're not a little anything!

31:09.452 --> 31:12.413
Doesn't it look
like the South of France?

31:12.580 --> 31:17.168
It's probably the south South of France.
Or even already Spain.

31:21.255 --> 31:23.966
Why did we stop here?
It's the pits.

31:24.133 --> 31:27.470
- And it stinks.
- Maybe it's an "arm" pit!

31:27.637 --> 31:30.431
Miss Delf said
to stop in the city,

31:30.598 --> 31:34.894
'cause it's warmer here.
It's a great thing called pollution.

31:35.061 --> 31:37.688
- Right, Miss Delf?
- Correct, Lisa.

31:38.064 --> 31:40.233
She said that's correct!

31:41.442 --> 31:42.568
Hey, look!

31:43.820 --> 31:45.446
Free food!

31:48.449 --> 31:50.910
Hey, guys, can I ask you...

31:55.456 --> 31:57.208
- Excuse me...
- Beat it!

31:58.209 --> 32:01.129
- Move it, shorty.
- Find another corner!

32:01.295 --> 32:02.630
Take off, Twiggy-

32:03.131 --> 32:06.300
I just want to know
which way to get to Africa!

32:14.642 --> 32:15.935
Help!

32:27.488 --> 32:30.616
For a little fella,
he sure got some bounce!

32:30.783 --> 32:34.704
We're being led by a moron!

32:46.132 --> 32:47.842
That hurt!

33:08.654 --> 33:09.947
Help!

33:10.114 --> 33:14.452
Delf! Janet!
It's too dark! I've got dark-aphobia!

33:14.619 --> 33:15.912
What're you doing?

33:16.078 --> 33:19.415
Sorry, I was just in there
inspecting the...

33:20.541 --> 33:23.836
Forget it.
Let's get outta here. This place stinks.

33:24.670 --> 33:27.298
Well yes, we were waiting for you.

33:27.465 --> 33:30.843
We need to pull everybody together.
This detour thing is...

33:31.010 --> 33:33.638
Well, Karl is nervous about it.

33:33.804 --> 33:36.974
Listen, I don't think
this is gonna work out.

33:37.141 --> 33:40.436
It's too dangerous. I gotta go home,
lots of housework.

33:40.603 --> 33:42.563
- I've got a bug to feed.
- What?

33:43.231 --> 33:45.441
Here's what I'm thinking:

33:45.608 --> 33:48.236
Do we really need
to go to "Africa" Africa?

33:48.402 --> 33:49.403
What?

33:49.570 --> 33:54.742
There's gotta be a ton of nice places
that are a lot closer than Africa.

33:55.284 --> 33:58.329
Places very "Africa-like", you know?

34:00.248 --> 34:04.293
OK. I get it.
I knew it was too good to be true.

34:04.669 --> 34:07.421
Why'd you help us out,
save an entire family,

34:07.588 --> 34:10.257
just 'cause of a promise
to a dying bird?

34:10.424 --> 34:14.011
No big deal. We'll go
our separate ways, we'll be fine.

34:14.428 --> 34:16.973
I'm sure you will. Fantastic!

34:17.139 --> 34:19.976
Bye. Lovely. Really. Bon voyage!

34:20.141 --> 34:25.022
We'll survive
for 6, maybe 7 days on our own.

34:25.188 --> 34:28.734
Don't worry about it.
We'll just make them count.

34:28.900 --> 34:30.695
Nah, well, it's just

34:30.860 --> 34:34.657
it's a lot farther than I thought.
I'm not built for this.

34:34.824 --> 34:38.327
I'm sure Karl will be
very happy to take over.

34:38.494 --> 34:42.081
Stop making excuses!
If my father wanted Karl to lead us,

34:42.248 --> 34:47.295
he would have said so. But he asked you.
He must've had a good reason.

34:49.255 --> 34:52.757
I really can't think of one.
Plus, he didn't really...

34:52.925 --> 34:55.886
My dad was never wrong, never.

34:56.053 --> 34:59.348
Maybe he saw
you had a good heart,

34:59.515 --> 35:01.892
you wouldn't leave us in the lurch.

35:02.727 --> 35:04.895
And you had a 6th sense.

35:05.062 --> 35:09.025
He had like a "6th sense" sense?
Like a 7th sense?

35:09.442 --> 35:11.736
You are a bit weird, it's true.

35:11.902 --> 35:14.030
But my father could spot potential.

35:14.405 --> 35:17.366
He saw right away
you were something special.

35:19.452 --> 35:24.123
I've finished my speech. You're supposed
to say: "Yes, Delf, you're right",

35:24.290 --> 35:27.043
I had my doubts,
but you turned me around."

35:27.209 --> 35:29.253
Sorry, my 6th sense must be off.

35:30.296 --> 35:32.131
<i>Pull yourself together, honeybun!</i>

35:32.632 --> 35:33.841
You, here?

35:34.216 --> 35:36.844
Trying to convince you
to lead our migration.

35:37.178 --> 35:39.847
- I'm not really here.
- Not here?

35:40.139 --> 35:42.850
Yeah, you do seem a little absent.

35:43.017 --> 35:45.353
Maybe that knock on your head...

35:45.519 --> 35:49.857
- So, you hear <i>what I</i> say?
- Maybe she's right about the knock.

35:50.024 --> 35:54.028
<i>I'll tell you another thing:
You can't leave them in the lurch!</i>

35:54.195 --> 35:55.905
I can't? That's right!

35:56.072 --> 35:57.198
Sorry?

35:57.365 --> 36:00.117
I mean,
I can't leave you all in the lurch.

36:00.284 --> 36:01.869
That's what I think.

36:02.745 --> 36:04.914
<i>It's time to take charge.</i>

36:05.081 --> 36:06.791
- Time to take charge.
- Really?

36:06.957 --> 36:10.127
- <i>Follow your instincts.</i>
- I'll <i>follow</i> my <i>instincts.</i>

36:10.294 --> 36:13.172
<i>- Besides, she's cute.</i>
- <i>You're</i> cute.

36:13.839 --> 36:15.091
Excuse me?

36:15.257 --> 36:18.219
Sorry!
That was my 6th sense talking!

36:18.386 --> 36:20.096
Yeah, it's working now.

36:20.262 --> 36:23.474
- So, you'll keep going?
- Yeah, OK!

36:23.849 --> 36:25.893
I can sense what's ahead!

36:26.936 --> 36:29.105
Wow, amazing!

36:29.772 --> 36:33.067
You are acting a little weird
but amazing!

36:33.234 --> 36:34.527
Let's go!

36:40.157 --> 36:43.285
Fall in line, campers!
The sun is rising.

36:43.452 --> 36:45.871
We've got an Africa to get to!

36:46.038 --> 36:50.543
I am not moving.
You can all take off to your doom.

36:50.710 --> 36:53.587
Just go without me.
Bon voyage, have fun.

36:54.088 --> 36:56.048
OK. See you next year!

36:56.215 --> 36:58.384
You would take off without me?

36:59.760 --> 37:01.554
Who does that?!

37:15.317 --> 37:17.778
Hey little bro! Ready to fly?

37:20.281 --> 37:22.450
Yah-hoo!

37:23.451 --> 37:24.869
Fleck!

37:26.537 --> 37:27.621
Thanks, pal!

37:27.997 --> 37:29.540
Sorry about that.

37:30.040 --> 37:31.584
No problem.

37:32.418 --> 37:35.504
I love kids. Just not for breakfast.

37:35.671 --> 37:38.257
You have to put on
some weight, bro.

37:38.424 --> 37:41.385
Catch a strong breeze,
you'll wind up in China!

37:41.552 --> 37:46.015
Don't sweat it. Your wings
will grow soon! So will your voice.

37:46.182 --> 37:50.853
You think so? 'Cause I gotta say,
I've really had it with this voice!

38:11.373 --> 38:15.920
Hey kid, why are all the others going
in the opposite direction?

38:16.086 --> 38:20.925
That's weird. They probably don't have
all the latest info, like myself.

38:21.091 --> 38:24.053
I should let them know.
I'll be right back.

38:28.766 --> 38:32.520
Hey, guys! Excuse me.
I'm in a bit of a jam here.

38:32.686 --> 38:35.147
Funny story:
I got some kooky directions.

38:35.314 --> 38:38.734
You wouldn't happen to know
which way is Africa?

38:38.901 --> 38:43.864
And how about South? You know
which way is South? Oh, forget it!

38:44.031 --> 38:47.326
I don't know
what my 6th sense is telling me.

38:47.493 --> 38:50.287
My other 5 senses
have gotten us lost.

38:50.454 --> 38:53.541
<i>Trust yourself. You'll find a path...</i>

38:53.707 --> 38:56.836
Really? You got me into this mess,

38:57.002 --> 38:59.922
you get me out!
You tell me the path.

39:00.089 --> 39:05.135
<i>Sorry, honeybun! Bad connection...
I'm losing contact.</i>

39:05.302 --> 39:06.595
How convenient!

39:06.762 --> 39:11.016
I knew it! You don't have a clue
where we are, do you?

39:11.183 --> 39:12.518
Sure I do...

39:12.685 --> 39:16.313
- Don't insult me, Yellow-nerd.
- I'm just being social!

39:16.480 --> 39:19.441
You're not. You're lost,
you're just a con man!

39:20.776 --> 39:23.362
We're no closer to Africa
than when we started.

39:23.529 --> 39:28.492
So, let's out the charade.
Go tell everyone what's really going on.

39:28.659 --> 39:32.621
You and I both know
by now we should've already reached...

39:32.788 --> 39:35.040
The sea! Yippee!

39:36.375 --> 39:38.210
Yeah! We're at the sea!

39:38.377 --> 39:40.296
What is the sea, Miss Delf?

39:40.462 --> 39:43.674
It's what lies between us
and Africa, Gigi.

39:44.091 --> 39:48.637
There it is! There's the sea,
right where it was supposed to be!

39:48.804 --> 39:51.724
It's all part of the plan.
I did it!

39:52.558 --> 39:55.603
That's basic migration math, really.

39:55.769 --> 39:58.939
After the fireflies,
I plotted a perpendicular line

39:59.106 --> 40:03.444
to the sub-cutaneous cloud bank,
the one shaped like a kitty cat.

40:03.611 --> 40:04.945
I just had a feeling.

40:05.112 --> 40:08.949
We should stop for the night
before we cross.

40:21.462 --> 40:23.797
What a nice place to stay!

40:24.089 --> 40:26.383
So lucky we found it!

40:26.550 --> 40:28.510
- I wonder where the others are!
- Welcome

40:28.928 --> 40:34.141
to the Beachfront Tree,
the finest accommodation on the coast!

40:34.308 --> 40:36.769
- Sir?
- We're having a special

40:36.936 --> 40:40.856
on our vacation suites,
room service included.

40:41.523 --> 40:44.360
I thought the season was over, sir...

40:44.985 --> 40:47.821
Shut up.
This is extra-business, putz.

40:47.988 --> 40:50.449
Aren't you expecting other travelers?

40:50.616 --> 40:52.952
You know,
crossing the Mediterranean?

40:53.118 --> 40:55.579
Ain't that like half a world away?

40:55.746 --> 40:58.332
Mediterranean. Oh, of course!

40:59.083 --> 41:02.920
So many guests
visit the Mediterranean here!

41:03.671 --> 41:06.757
Lots of tourists, day and night.

41:06.924 --> 41:10.219
Busy like bees.
But we don't have bees.

41:10.678 --> 41:14.098
- Clean bill of health.
- What? Oh yeah...!

41:14.264 --> 41:17.226
But he said
the season was over.

41:17.393 --> 41:20.354
No, no! You're just early!

41:20.521 --> 41:22.606
Lucky you're the first here.

41:22.773 --> 41:25.150
'Cause after that,
it's booked, booked, booked!

41:25.317 --> 41:27.528
Wait. Excuse me.

41:27.695 --> 41:31.448
Can we back up a sec?
What do you mean we're "early"?

41:31.615 --> 41:34.743
- Where are we exactly?
- In Holland.

41:36.370 --> 41:41.458
This is Spain. Just look all around you
at the lovely Spanish scenery.

41:41.625 --> 41:46.463
Spain over there, Spain over here.
Spain left and right. Look behind you,

41:46.630 --> 41:48.298
more Spain!

41:48.757 --> 41:51.885
Yeah, you won't get
much more Spanish than us!

41:52.052 --> 41:55.222
- Bien-vah-neeedo! Olé!
- I've been to Spain.

41:55.639 --> 41:57.766
Where are the olive trees?

41:59.184 --> 42:01.228
Where...? Frozen.

42:01.812 --> 42:05.816
Dead, all of them.
Just like that, CLACK! Such a disaster.

42:05.983 --> 42:07.943
My wife and I wept!

42:08.110 --> 42:12.531
Wept and wept!
Especially her. She just kept saying:

42:12.698 --> 42:14.992
"Where are my olive trees?"

42:15.534 --> 42:18.829
Boy, what a painful time
in our lives that was.

42:19.038 --> 42:20.789
- Wow!
- Yeah!

42:21.123 --> 42:25.502
- Sounds like a national tragedy.
- "Olive-Apocalypse," we called it.

42:25.669 --> 42:28.380
"It'll never look like Spain!"
I said.

42:29.423 --> 42:32.301
It makes it look nothing like Spain.

42:32.468 --> 42:33.886
Terrible, right?

42:34.053 --> 42:37.890
You know, with global warming,
globalization and whatnot,

42:38.057 --> 42:41.351
everything looks the same,
wherever you are!

42:41.518 --> 42:44.271
Take this hole.
One of our luxury suites.

42:44.438 --> 42:47.191
Low fungus, no sap,
ventilation marvelous.

42:47.357 --> 42:51.403
Had a bald eagle stay here once,
true story.

42:51.570 --> 42:55.449
Follow me, folks.
I have a nice room for you all.

42:55.616 --> 42:59.912
- Boy oh boy! I could get used to this.
- Not with this sea air.

43:00.079 --> 43:01.997
I'm starting to freeze!

43:02.164 --> 43:06.251
You never had a real first name?
That's awful!

43:06.418 --> 43:08.587
Nah, it's just
that my parents never

43:08.754 --> 43:11.215
had time to give me one
before I was...

43:11.381 --> 43:13.842
I've got a few names
we could call you.

43:14.009 --> 43:16.595
You must have thought
about choosing one?

43:16.762 --> 43:19.431
Uh, no. You know what?
It never came up.

43:19.598 --> 43:21.433
What about "Scatterbrain"?

43:21.600 --> 43:23.018
Or "Chicken Wings"?

43:23.185 --> 43:27.397
Enough, Karl! Don't pick on him.
He's had that his whole life.

43:27.564 --> 43:28.816
Not my whole life...

43:28.982 --> 43:32.111
Of course the poor thing
never had a name.

43:32.277 --> 43:36.156
So small he's been forgotten.
Just a bundle of feathers.

43:39.993 --> 43:43.122
Bring a dish of crunchy maggots
to my room.

43:43.288 --> 43:45.124
Right away, sir.

43:45.290 --> 43:47.584
You're gonna love 'em.
The best in Holland.

43:47.751 --> 43:49.837
Holland? Holland!

43:50.003 --> 43:53.173
- I meant Spain...
- You said "Holland!"

43:53.757 --> 43:57.761
No, no. "Hollan-daise sauce," amigo!

44:04.977 --> 44:06.436
Holland...

44:10.482 --> 44:15.070
How did you get such a sense
of direction if you're not a migrator?

44:15.237 --> 44:18.657
He must have an internal compass
like homing pigeons.

44:18.824 --> 44:21.660
Are you part pigeon
on your mother's side?

44:21.827 --> 44:23.537
Something like that...

44:24.454 --> 44:26.915
Who sent you?
Where are you taking us?

44:27.082 --> 44:28.792
- Into a trap?
- What?

44:28.959 --> 44:31.670
- To get rid of us?
- Karl, what're you doing?

44:32.004 --> 44:36.175
- Karl, stop it!
- Willy, stay out of this. It's true.

44:36.341 --> 44:38.886
Calm down, son!
What's this all about?

44:39.052 --> 44:41.430
He's an imposter.

44:41.597 --> 44:43.348
And we're in Holland,

44:43.515 --> 44:46.101
not Spain! He's leading us

44:46.268 --> 44:50.731
straight North! He's probably
against migrators. You're sabotaging us!

44:51.064 --> 44:53.025
Karl, we're here by the sea.

44:53.775 --> 44:57.070
On the coast of Holland!

44:57.237 --> 44:58.572
That's North!

44:58.739 --> 45:01.283
When will you people wake up?

45:02.534 --> 45:03.744
Please, where are we?

45:05.704 --> 45:06.788
Spain.

45:07.456 --> 45:10.083
- Well?
- You're trusting rodents now?

45:11.335 --> 45:13.295
They're a bunch of liars!

45:13.462 --> 45:15.255
Hey, that's "Anti-Rat"!

45:15.422 --> 45:18.258
Sorry, this is
just a little family problem.

45:18.467 --> 45:21.094
Just "a little family problem"!

45:21.261 --> 45:23.680
No matter what I say,

45:23.847 --> 45:27.226
my family never seems to listen to me!

45:27.392 --> 45:29.394
What's your problem with me, huh?

45:29.561 --> 45:34.274
Am I too ambitious? Do I speak my mind?
Maybe I'm too modest?

45:34.900 --> 45:37.736
I'm too loud for you, am I?

45:41.073 --> 45:42.074
Yes.

45:42.950 --> 45:43.867
Well, yes.

45:44.034 --> 45:46.245
OK, in a word, yes, right.

45:47.079 --> 45:48.580
Right on the button.

45:48.747 --> 45:51.708
Well, you won't have to
put up with me anymore.

45:52.376 --> 45:56.296
I'll go find another family,
one that will take me as I am.

45:56.463 --> 45:58.632
- You mean super-obnoxious?
- Max!

45:59.633 --> 46:03.553
- Karl, we gotta stick together.
- Gotta calm down, sweets.

46:03.929 --> 46:06.765
Relax. You're far too tense.

46:06.932 --> 46:08.725
I'm not "too tense"!

46:09.601 --> 46:12.104
Let's take a little flight.

46:12.271 --> 46:15.399
I hear the oxygen is
really pure up here, but

46:15.565 --> 46:17.150
we gotta fly real high.

46:17.317 --> 46:19.486
I'm not "too tense"!

46:22.447 --> 46:24.908
Max, come with us.
You'll like this.

46:25.993 --> 46:27.619
Do I gotta?

46:29.204 --> 46:31.540
Don't get back too late, OK?

46:31.707 --> 46:34.334
Go easy on the oxygen.
Max is still young!

46:35.585 --> 46:37.587
Goodnight, you two.

46:52.853 --> 46:54.146
I'm really sorry

46:54.313 --> 46:55.647
about Karl.

46:56.148 --> 46:59.526
Delf, you know,
Karl's not as bad as all that.

46:59.693 --> 47:01.862
He's right about... some things.

47:02.029 --> 47:05.907
Don't doubt yourself again.
Africa is right across the sea.

47:07.200 --> 47:10.203
- Why are you so sure?
- You've come through.

47:10.620 --> 47:14.374
Show off a little!
Why is that so hard for you?

47:14.541 --> 47:16.168
It's just that...

47:16.835 --> 47:19.129
I'm not a migrator, that's all.

47:22.924 --> 47:26.928
Maybe my 6th sense is...
kind of senseless.

47:27.429 --> 47:31.767
It'll be over soon. We're almost there.
Then you're free to go.

47:32.517 --> 47:36.229
You're afraid that once we get there,
we won't let you leave.

47:36.396 --> 47:41.777
That we'll make you lead us back home,
then depend on you year after year.

47:41.943 --> 47:43.195
Is that it?

47:44.196 --> 47:45.655
Let me tell you...

47:46.156 --> 47:48.909
A friend of my dad's
is waiting for us.

47:49.368 --> 47:52.454
A veteran migrator.
And once we're in Africa,

47:52.621 --> 47:56.500
he'll take us under his wing
until one of us can take over.

47:57.125 --> 48:00.295
So, can you just get us to him?

48:00.462 --> 48:03.215
I think so. What's his name?

48:03.507 --> 48:06.259
- His name?
- Yeah, you know... His name!

48:06.885 --> 48:08.470
His name is...

48:08.970 --> 48:11.223
<i>Sass... Saaa...</i>

48:11.390 --> 48:13.642
Saaaa?

48:15.811 --> 48:16.686
Sam...

48:17.312 --> 48:18.688
- Sam?
- O.

48:18.855 --> 48:19.856
<i>Same'?</i>

48:20.023 --> 48:22.109
O... O'Coole!

48:22.275 --> 48:23.443
"Sam O'Coole"?

48:23.610 --> 48:26.446
Yes! Sam O'Coole!

48:27.114 --> 48:29.032
He's... Irish!

48:29.199 --> 48:31.243
Sam O'Coole?

48:31.785 --> 48:34.121
That is the coolest name ever!

48:34.287 --> 48:36.456
He is cool. If you get us to him,

48:36.623 --> 48:39.042
after that you'll be free, I promise.

48:39.209 --> 48:42.087
You can go home
to your friend Ladybug,

48:42.754 --> 48:47.175
she can call you "honeybun"
all day long. I bet you miss that a lot.

48:47.342 --> 48:48.927
Yeah... Well, uh...

48:49.594 --> 48:51.054
Promise?

48:56.726 --> 48:59.438
Promise. Until you're in good hands

48:59.604 --> 49:00.939
with Sam O'Coole.

49:01.106 --> 49:03.900
Fantastic. Alright. Goodnight.

49:04.067 --> 49:06.528
Yes, g-goodnight.

49:09.948 --> 49:13.118
- Sorry, I'm just...
- Excuse me.

49:13.785 --> 49:14.953
See you tomorrow.

49:17.747 --> 49:20.000
I'm OK! I'm fine!

49:20.167 --> 49:22.752
I'm just gonna go stretch my legs.

49:28.550 --> 49:30.552
- It's mine!
- No, it's mine.

49:30.719 --> 49:32.762
No way! That was mine!

49:32.929 --> 49:35.849
Stop it! Mommy said
we weren't supposed to...

49:36.016 --> 49:37.392
No, it's mine! Ow!

49:38.143 --> 49:41.062
Hey! Some of us are trying to sleep!

49:41.563 --> 49:42.731
Quiet down now!

49:43.482 --> 49:45.525
I told you
no fruit flies indoors!

49:45.692 --> 49:49.863
We don't play with food!
Now brush your feathers and go to bed!

49:50.030 --> 49:52.616
Hey, kids!
You want a bedtime story?

49:52.782 --> 49:55.243
- Nah, give us a break.
- No, thanks.

49:55.702 --> 49:57.829
Nah, give us a break.

49:58.163 --> 50:01.041
Pity.
It was a story about the iron birds.

50:01.208 --> 50:02.834
Is it a really scary story?

50:03.001 --> 50:06.671
Are there people
who get chased and scream like...

50:10.050 --> 50:11.801
Well, to tell you the truth,

50:11.968 --> 50:15.013
we don't know much
about the iron birds.

50:15.180 --> 50:18.600
All we know is,
there are more and more of them.

50:18.767 --> 50:21.853
But no-one's ever seen an iron bird egg.

50:22.020 --> 50:25.148
So, they must come from another planet!

50:34.783 --> 50:37.202
6th sense, 6th sense, pfft!

50:37.369 --> 50:39.829
I don't even know if I have 5 senses!

50:44.501 --> 50:48.797
Now, if the North Star is over there,
that must be the evening star

50:48.964 --> 50:53.802
in relation to the constellation of
"I've-no-idea-what-I'm-talking-about!"

50:55.470 --> 50:57.097
<i>Well, don't look at me!</i>

50:57.264 --> 50:59.558
<i>I'm not an astronomer.</i>

51:04.980 --> 51:06.606
Excuse me, ma'am?

51:06.940 --> 51:09.025
Huh? Ma'am?

51:09.317 --> 51:12.028
Sir! Sorry. Good evening.

51:13.405 --> 51:15.448
Where exactly are we?

51:16.032 --> 51:17.242
On the beach!

51:17.409 --> 51:19.703
Yes, I know that, thank you.

51:20.120 --> 51:22.581
I mean, in relation to Africa?

51:22.747 --> 51:25.375
That's the Mediterranean there, right?

51:26.167 --> 51:28.295
Not quite, pal. Sorry to say,

51:28.461 --> 51:30.964
Africa's not around the corner either.

51:31.548 --> 51:33.049
Oh, no!

51:33.967 --> 51:37.429
The Equator, the tropical countries,
which way are they?

51:37.596 --> 51:40.390
Oh, you'll have to ask
my wife about that.

51:40.557 --> 51:42.100
Marjorie!

51:42.475 --> 51:45.395
Coming, honey!
I'm just shopping for dinner!

51:46.021 --> 51:51.067
OK, babydoll, but this young fella
wants some directions to the Equator.

51:51.651 --> 51:54.529
The Equator? Oh, that's easy.

51:54.696 --> 51:57.699
It's at right angles to the trajectory

51:57.866 --> 52:00.660
of the setting sun,
opposite the North Star.

52:00.827 --> 52:03.413
- Is he staying for dinner?
- No, thanks.

52:05.040 --> 52:08.084
Any tips
for finding my bearings out there?

52:08.501 --> 52:13.006
Oh, well, you know,
Marjorie and I never go anywhere

52:13.173 --> 52:14.257
on vacation.

52:14.424 --> 52:17.010
He never takes me anywhere.

52:17.177 --> 52:19.429
"We're fine where we are",
he says!

52:22.140 --> 52:23.933
She loves it here.

52:25.602 --> 52:27.604
I'm totally useless.

52:27.771 --> 52:30.023
What're you saying that for?

52:30.649 --> 52:34.235
I've been leading a whole family
in the wrong direction.

52:34.402 --> 52:36.696
Just because I wanted
to see the world.

52:36.863 --> 52:38.865
I was only thinking of myself

52:39.032 --> 52:42.118
and I put everyone in danger.
What'll I do?

52:43.870 --> 52:45.497
I think I know exactly

52:45.664 --> 52:47.457
what you need.

52:47.624 --> 52:48.917
Come here.

52:50.877 --> 52:53.797
Well, how do we feel now?

52:54.214 --> 52:57.092
Crushed... by love!

53:12.482 --> 53:15.402
Did I tell ya or did I tell ya?

53:15.568 --> 53:19.239
Breathe it in! The good stuff!

53:21.366 --> 53:22.617
Unreal!

53:23.201 --> 53:25.870
The stars all floaty...

53:26.579 --> 53:28.164
See that unicorn?

53:29.290 --> 53:32.794
You won't be able to fly
in a straight line tomorrow!

53:35.922 --> 53:38.717
What do you say?
Maybe a little higher?

53:46.057 --> 53:47.892
I'm very impressed!

53:48.393 --> 53:52.105
- It even worked on the big ones.
- In the master's hands!

53:52.272 --> 53:55.650
So full of yourself!
Ls Fleck in bed too?

53:55.817 --> 53:58.361
Yes. In the hole right across from us.

54:01.531 --> 54:03.366
Where could he have gone?

54:24.179 --> 54:28.558
It's good to crack up with you guys,
because I love you guys!

54:28.975 --> 54:30.852
I love you!

54:32.145 --> 54:35.857
But you don't love me.
No, you don't love me.

54:36.024 --> 54:38.193
We do love you, man,

54:38.359 --> 54:40.153
we do.

54:40.945 --> 54:42.655
What is that?

54:44.532 --> 54:48.912
It's my heart
beating out love for you guys.

54:53.708 --> 54:55.627
An iron bird!

55:00.715 --> 55:02.175
Fleck! Where are you?

55:02.342 --> 55:04.260
Fleck! Answer me!

55:04.427 --> 55:05.470
There!

55:07.055 --> 55:07.931
Fleck...

55:12.894 --> 55:14.938
Oh, no, he wants to try to fly!

55:15.730 --> 55:17.565
Fleck! No!

55:21.611 --> 55:23.488
Iron bird!

55:23.655 --> 55:25.907
We saw an iron bird!

55:26.074 --> 55:27.534
Fleck!

55:29.244 --> 55:30.745
Willy!

55:52.225 --> 55:53.476
Willy!

56:07.532 --> 56:08.533
Help!

56:18.293 --> 56:22.422
Thank-you-very-much-sir.

56:24.465 --> 56:25.758
Fleck!

56:27.135 --> 56:30.138
Oh, my little brother! You're alright.

56:31.139 --> 56:32.974
Don't ever do that again!

56:34.350 --> 56:38.187
Sorry. We didn't see
the little guy on the cliff.

56:38.354 --> 56:40.440
Yeah! We're at the sea.

56:42.358 --> 56:45.403
You saved him again!
Thanks, super hero.

56:45.570 --> 56:47.822
Don't thank me, thank him!

56:49.240 --> 56:50.992
Thank the blubber!

56:54.287 --> 56:56.414
Really, thanks for everything!

56:56.581 --> 56:59.584
I know what to do now. Goodnight.

56:59.751 --> 57:01.169
Goodnight!

57:01.628 --> 57:03.171
Thanks again.

57:05.131 --> 57:06.507
Delf, I have...

57:07.508 --> 57:09.135
something to tell you.

57:09.302 --> 57:11.679
I think I know, Mr. Hero.

57:12.138 --> 57:14.349
- You do?
- I've seen you look at me.

57:14.515 --> 57:17.143
- That's not it!
- I'm sorry.

57:17.310 --> 57:20.355
I mean, it could be,
but not what I was...

57:20.521 --> 57:22.899
That was stupid of me to assume...

57:23.066 --> 57:26.569
Wow, Delf. You really stepped
into that one. Excuse me.

57:26.736 --> 57:27.737
Wait!

57:28.780 --> 57:32.617
I do look at you!
I'm looking at you now... leaving.

57:33.660 --> 57:36.746
Why is it so hard
to tell her the truth?

58:57.952 --> 58:59.579
Yellowbird! Wake up!

59:05.126 --> 59:07.462
There are lots in this tree.

59:07.628 --> 59:10.298
Go! Go! I'll catch up!

59:29.025 --> 59:31.444
What kind of a racket are you...

59:41.537 --> 59:45.208
That's it! I'm staying
somewhere else next season.

59:51.547 --> 59:54.133
No! Don't go that way!

01:00:07.230 --> 01:00:09.440
Delf! Delf!

01:00:10.733 --> 01:00:12.568
Hey! Hey, Stop!

01:00:13.486 --> 01:00:16.072
- Everybody stop!
- Look who's back.

01:00:17.782 --> 01:00:19.117
Delf, wait!

01:00:19.283 --> 01:00:21.327
Look, I don't need an apology.

01:00:21.494 --> 01:00:23.162
It's not what I'm trying...

01:00:23.329 --> 01:00:27.792
Get us across the sea if my father's
wishes mean anything to you.

01:00:27.959 --> 01:00:31.212
That's it!
I don't think this is the right sea!

01:00:31.379 --> 01:00:34.590
What's going on?
You're making everyone nervous.

01:00:35.174 --> 01:00:38.594
Everyone, listen to me!
I think we should head back.

01:00:38.761 --> 01:00:42.223
- Enough already!
- Hey! There's a headwind

01:00:42.390 --> 01:00:44.225
up ahead. And a big bank

01:00:44.392 --> 01:00:46.227
of scary-looking clouds.

01:00:46.561 --> 01:00:49.355
We should listen to him
and head back.

01:00:49.522 --> 01:00:50.773
Too late for that!

01:00:51.524 --> 01:00:52.525
Too late?

01:00:52.900 --> 01:00:55.945
From the smell of it,
that storm is gonna hit us.

01:00:56.946 --> 01:00:58.281
So what do we do, son?

01:00:58.781 --> 01:01:02.660
We need to drop some altitude
and get under the wind tunnel.

01:01:03.369 --> 01:01:08.749
Then, try to spot somewhere to land,
a bank of seaweed or the tip of a rock.

01:01:09.208 --> 01:01:11.002
I don't like this.

01:01:27.643 --> 01:01:30.104
Can you guys see anything?

01:01:30.271 --> 01:01:32.064
No, not yet!

01:01:32.231 --> 01:01:35.860
Stay under the wind but above the water!
I know it's hard!

01:01:36.569 --> 01:01:38.946
Mom! The Wind's making me cold.

01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:41.449
Hang on, Anton. We'll land soon.

01:01:41.782 --> 01:01:45.286
If we can find somewhere...
We don't have much time.

01:01:48.206 --> 01:01:51.042
Wait a minute! Over there!

01:02:15.650 --> 01:02:18.778
We have to wait
till the storm blows over.

01:02:18.945 --> 01:02:20.529
The kids are hungry.

01:02:21.364 --> 01:02:24.825
They'll never reach the coast
with empty bellies.

01:02:25.826 --> 01:02:28.955
Maybe there's something to eat
down there.

01:02:29.121 --> 01:02:30.665
Any other bright ideas?

01:02:30.831 --> 01:02:33.793
Karl, listen to him for once.

01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:38.381
For once! Excuse me, Delf!
Right from the very start,

01:02:38.547 --> 01:02:40.800
we've followed every suggestion

01:02:40.967 --> 01:02:43.344
of this total s-s-stranger!

01:02:43.886 --> 01:02:46.264
How long will he be a stranger?

01:02:46.430 --> 01:02:49.183
We're in a pretty bad situation,
Delf honey.

01:02:49.350 --> 01:02:51.519
He couldn't have predicted
the storm!

01:02:51.686 --> 01:02:54.981
Isn't that what a 6th sense is for?

01:02:55.398 --> 01:02:57.066
Say something.

01:02:57.608 --> 01:02:59.360
I... I...

01:03:00.736 --> 01:03:03.990
<i>I'd shut it.
It's no time to make a speech.</i>

01:03:05.950 --> 01:03:07.868
- I'll look for food.
- Wait up!

01:03:10.871 --> 01:03:12.415
I'm coming with you.

01:03:14.583 --> 01:03:16.711
Willy, go with them.
Michka and I

01:03:16.877 --> 01:03:21.132
will go this way.
The rest of you, stay where you are.

01:03:49.952 --> 01:03:51.245
Hey! Wait for us.

01:03:51.412 --> 01:03:53.706
Why is Karl being such an idiot?

01:03:55.082 --> 01:03:57.585
You can't say
he's completely wrong.

01:03:57.752 --> 01:03:58.878
You're siding with him?

01:03:59.045 --> 01:04:02.089
I'm not the only one.
Look where we are, Delf!

01:04:02.256 --> 01:04:04.967
- You've got a crush on him...
- What? No!

01:04:05.134 --> 01:04:07.803
- That's not it!
- It's OK if you do.

01:04:12.391 --> 01:04:13.601
But...

01:04:29.575 --> 01:04:31.577
I can hardly see a thing.

01:04:31.744 --> 01:04:34.246
And it smells like a garbage dump.

01:04:35.289 --> 01:04:38.042
Please tell me
that was your stomach.

01:04:43.672 --> 01:04:46.759
See how Delf sticks up
for that yellow bird?

01:04:46.926 --> 01:04:48.427
Yeah... well... I...

01:04:49.470 --> 01:04:50.930
Where's Anton?

01:05:14.161 --> 01:05:17.164
Your eyeballs popped
right out of your heads!

01:05:22.503 --> 01:05:25.047
OK, scaredy-birds!
I get the point.

01:05:34.807 --> 01:05:37.143
Maggie, give me a hand!

01:05:55.244 --> 01:05:56.537
The children!

01:05:59.665 --> 01:06:02.501
They must be in trouble.
We gotta go back!

01:06:12.428 --> 01:06:15.014
- Don't panic! Keep calm!
- Yes, right!

01:06:15.181 --> 01:06:16.932
EVERYONE KEEP CALM!

01:06:17.099 --> 01:06:19.059
- DON'T PANIC!
- Calm down.

01:06:19.935 --> 01:06:21.312
Right... Sure.

01:06:21.937 --> 01:06:24.398
Let me catch my breath.
This way!

01:06:41.999 --> 01:06:45.461
Mommy, I really don't feel too good.

01:06:45.628 --> 01:06:48.672
You'll be fine, honey.
You can eat something...

01:06:48.839 --> 01:06:52.051
Listen! There are zombies
all over the place!

01:06:52.218 --> 01:06:56.305
We've got to get out.
If we can remember where we came from,

01:06:56.472 --> 01:06:59.850
we can go the same way.
- The kids are exhausted.

01:07:00.017 --> 01:07:02.686
- You have a better solution?
- Stop

01:07:02.853 --> 01:07:05.606
sneaking up on us!
- What'll we do?

01:07:05.773 --> 01:07:07.024
We can't stay here!

01:07:07.191 --> 01:07:08.776
We can't go back into the storm!

01:07:08.943 --> 01:07:12.696
That's enough!
From now on, I call the shots!

01:07:12.863 --> 01:07:15.533
Anyone who doesn't agree
with what I say

01:07:15.699 --> 01:07:18.327
will have to go it alone! Understand?

01:07:24.500 --> 01:07:25.918
Karl!

01:07:34.635 --> 01:07:37.680
Get the kids out.
We'll take care of Karl!

01:07:39.974 --> 01:07:41.517
Come on, kid.

01:08:30.774 --> 01:08:33.027
- Alright!
- Fleck, what're you doing?

01:08:33.193 --> 01:08:36.029
No sweat, Mich!
I've got it covered!

01:08:43.287 --> 01:08:44.787
Fleck, no!

01:08:45.956 --> 01:08:47.166
Hey!

01:08:53.589 --> 01:08:55.716
We did it, guys!

01:08:56.508 --> 01:09:00.054
Bravo, little brother!
That was one supersonic flight!

01:09:02.221 --> 01:09:03.432
Lisa?

01:09:11.064 --> 01:09:12.899
They're birds

01:09:13.067 --> 01:09:14.484
just like us!

01:09:18.863 --> 01:09:21.158
Come on!
We can still save them!

01:10:06.704 --> 01:10:08.038
We're safe!

01:10:13.127 --> 01:10:15.879
Oh no! We're caught
in a stream of cold air!

01:10:16.380 --> 01:10:19.508
We must slow down!
We're heading North!

01:10:21.593 --> 01:10:24.888
- Hold on to me!
- I can't!

01:10:49.455 --> 01:10:51.999
Go and warm up
the kids instead, Willy.

01:10:53.208 --> 01:10:55.961
They need you. Go.

01:11:20.110 --> 01:11:22.696
We're all gonna die here
in the cold!

01:11:22.863 --> 01:11:26.283
- Because of you.
- Oh Karl, please.

01:11:26.658 --> 01:11:29.077
I should've taken over from Darius!

01:11:29.244 --> 01:11:31.705
But he picked you.
Why would he do that?

01:11:34.750 --> 01:11:35.959
He didn't.

01:11:38.670 --> 01:11:40.547
You're right, Karl. I lied.

01:11:41.298 --> 01:11:44.468
I lied to all of you.
I was just a messenger.

01:11:44.635 --> 01:11:47.971
Darius just wanted me
to tell Karl to take over.

01:11:48.138 --> 01:11:49.389
He said it was

01:11:49.556 --> 01:11:51.058
your time to lead.

01:11:51.225 --> 01:11:52.643
Darius said that?

01:11:52.976 --> 01:11:54.520
I'm sorry.

01:11:55.312 --> 01:11:57.356
I wanted to be
part of the flock.

01:11:57.856 --> 01:12:01.693
- I had no idea it would...
- How could you do that to us?

01:12:02.027 --> 01:12:03.654
I trusted you!

01:12:06.907 --> 01:12:10.369
I tried to tell you so many times.

01:12:11.620 --> 01:12:14.039
I never wanted to hurt you.

01:12:19.169 --> 01:12:20.712
I am so, so sorry.

01:12:24.508 --> 01:12:26.969
- Wait!
- Delf...

01:12:27.344 --> 01:12:28.720
Let him go.

01:13:33.368 --> 01:13:35.120
<i>Honeybun!</i>

01:13:38.373 --> 01:13:40.542
<i>Honeybunny!</i>

01:15:03.208 --> 01:15:05.669
It's the dumbest idea
I ever heard!

01:15:14.302 --> 01:15:17.347
I don't think
the iron birds are dangerous.

01:15:17.514 --> 01:15:20.934
They swallow humans,
but spit them out somewhere else.

01:15:21.101 --> 01:15:24.187
You're out of your mind.
We'll all get killed!

01:15:24.521 --> 01:15:28.025
This guy is both a liar and a numbskull.

01:15:28.692 --> 01:15:30.694
- No offense.
- No, that's right.

01:15:30.861 --> 01:15:33.280
The reason we changed our path

01:15:33.447 --> 01:15:38.035
was to avoid the iron birds,
not to serve ourselves up as appetizers!

01:15:38.201 --> 01:15:40.328
We don't know if they eat birds.

01:15:40.620 --> 01:15:44.416
Miss Delf, are we gonna be eaten up
by the iron birds?

01:15:44.583 --> 01:15:47.419
Don't worry, Gigi, that's not the plan.

01:15:47.586 --> 01:15:50.088
I don't know.
The stories we've heard!

01:15:50.255 --> 01:15:53.258
Just stories.
This might be our only hope.

01:15:53.425 --> 01:15:55.385
Or the worst idea ever.

01:15:55.552 --> 01:15:57.637
That Yellowbird has gotten us

01:15:57.804 --> 01:16:00.015
into enough jams.
He's never been

01:16:00.182 --> 01:16:03.602
straight with us.
This is a dangerous, untested plan.

01:16:03.769 --> 01:16:07.189
He's not qualified
to lead this group in any way!

01:16:07.355 --> 01:16:10.817
- You realize that?
- That's enough! Stop!

01:16:11.234 --> 01:16:16.406
Listen up or I'll turn your earrings
into guts! I'll eat your teeth

01:16:16.573 --> 01:16:19.576
till your mother
looks like pigeon puke!

01:16:23.580 --> 01:16:26.958
No, it's actually
"I'll rip out your guts"

01:16:27.125 --> 01:16:29.294
and I won't eat your teeth...

01:16:29.461 --> 01:16:31.755
I deeply apologize to your mother.

01:16:32.506 --> 01:16:36.051
What I mean is, I know
I'm responsible for our troubles.

01:16:36.551 --> 01:16:39.054
But I also know
that if we stay here,

01:16:39.221 --> 01:16:40.555
we're going to die.

01:16:40.931 --> 01:16:44.309
If we try this plan,
we have a chance to survive.

01:16:44.768 --> 01:16:46.061
Maybe.

01:16:49.106 --> 01:16:52.067
- I'll go with a maybe.
- Me too.

01:16:52.234 --> 01:16:54.528
- Me too.
- Count me in.

01:16:55.070 --> 01:16:59.157
Heck, my whole life is a maybe.
Let's do this.

01:16:59.783 --> 01:17:01.326
Yeah, alright.

01:17:03.703 --> 01:17:06.289
The cold must've frozen
your bird brains!

01:17:19.970 --> 01:17:23.598
OK... but... which one?

01:17:40.699 --> 01:17:41.741
That one.

01:17:45.453 --> 01:17:47.664
I don't want you to see this.

01:17:47.831 --> 01:17:48.915
Aw, Mom!

01:18:15.358 --> 01:18:17.694
OK, we're good to go!

01:18:25.035 --> 01:18:28.205
Oh, boy! That's cold!

01:18:35.795 --> 01:18:37.255
Now what?

01:18:37.422 --> 01:18:39.174
We go in there.

01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:43.970
Into its behind?

01:18:44.137 --> 01:18:46.765
As soon as their backs are turned...

01:18:56.233 --> 01:18:57.317
Now's our chance!

01:19:10.455 --> 01:19:11.831
Wait! Where's Karl?

01:19:12.332 --> 01:19:13.625
Stay here!

01:19:18.797 --> 01:19:21.216
Karl, we gotta go!

01:19:21.508 --> 01:19:25.220
- Quick!
- You can all doom yourselves. I won't!

01:19:25.387 --> 01:19:26.930
I can't believe this!

01:19:39.401 --> 01:19:40.568
What's that?

01:19:41.069 --> 01:19:42.195
Let me go!

01:19:44.197 --> 01:19:45.782
I won't leave you.

01:19:53.957 --> 01:19:55.333
Oh no!

01:20:04.426 --> 01:20:05.635
Come on!

01:20:11.099 --> 01:20:13.101
The door is closing!

01:20:18.857 --> 01:20:21.484
Get in there, Karl! Go!

01:20:35.248 --> 01:20:38.335
- Is this normal?
- I think we're flying!

01:20:44.674 --> 01:20:46.217
- Karl...
- What?

01:20:46.384 --> 01:20:47.719
Thank you.

01:20:48.428 --> 01:20:49.763
- Don't mention it.
- OK.

01:20:49.929 --> 01:20:52.766
I mean it.
We don't ever mention it again.

01:20:53.433 --> 01:20:55.352
Ever, you hear?

01:22:12.846 --> 01:22:14.681
You should come and see this!

01:22:22.397 --> 01:22:23.898
Africa!

01:23:01.769 --> 01:23:04.105
So wonderful to be back!

01:23:04.772 --> 01:23:07.400
Look at this splendid view.

01:23:07.609 --> 01:23:08.735
It's beautiful!

01:23:08.902 --> 01:23:11.446
Even better than I remember.

01:23:11.613 --> 01:23:14.240
- We did it, guys.
- Hurray!

01:23:14.407 --> 01:23:15.700
High-five!

01:23:15.867 --> 01:23:17.118
Yeah, man!

01:23:19.704 --> 01:23:21.998
Now we stay put for 6 months.

01:23:27.378 --> 01:23:28.505
Hey!

01:23:28.671 --> 01:23:31.007
Where do you think you're going?

01:23:31.174 --> 01:23:34.010
Well... you're in Africa.

01:23:34.385 --> 01:23:36.888
I'll just leave you guys alone.

01:23:37.222 --> 01:23:38.848
You can't go now.

01:23:39.474 --> 01:23:43.520
You don't need me now.
You just have to find Sam O'Coole.

01:23:43.937 --> 01:23:49.943
Sam O'Coole? Wow! What kind
of made-up-on-the-spot name is that?

01:23:50.109 --> 01:23:51.736
You're joking, right?

01:23:52.070 --> 01:23:54.864
- Only a turkey falls for that!
- Wait...

01:23:55.240 --> 01:23:56.783
Delf, when you said...

01:23:56.950 --> 01:23:59.202
And I said...
So the whole time...

01:23:59.661 --> 01:24:01.621
I'm such an idiot.

01:24:03.039 --> 01:24:04.624
No, I don't think so.

01:24:05.124 --> 01:24:08.211
You sure took me for a ride.
Sam O'Coole.

01:24:08.378 --> 01:24:12.131
- No-one can carry off that name.
- Someone could.

01:24:13.466 --> 01:24:15.426
I mean the Sam part.

01:24:16.886 --> 01:24:18.471
"Sam!" Yeah!

01:24:18.638 --> 01:24:21.182
- It suits you perfectly.
- Totally!

01:24:21.349 --> 01:24:23.851
You need a real first name, right?

01:24:24.018 --> 01:24:27.397
You're not getting a say in this.
If all this yelling

01:24:27.564 --> 01:24:30.858
and judging and pecking at each other

01:24:31.025 --> 01:24:33.903
doesn't make us family,
I don't know what does.

01:24:34.070 --> 01:24:36.864
We froze in a snowstorm,
and I was right...

01:24:37.031 --> 01:24:39.075
Karl! Drop it!

01:24:40.910 --> 01:24:44.664
OK. Riding those iron birds
was a pretty good idea...

01:24:45.039 --> 01:24:46.291
Sam!

01:24:47.375 --> 01:24:50.545
Hey, little fella,
you're part of the flock now.

01:25:01.514 --> 01:25:05.184
<i>Well done, honeybun!
I'm so proud of you!</i>

01:25:05.560 --> 01:25:09.397
<i>Maybe I exaggerated a bit,
but you don't mind?</i>

01:25:09.564 --> 01:25:12.233
<i>You did ever so well, Sam.</i>

01:25:13.151 --> 01:25:16.154
Hey! We gotta celebrate this.

01:25:17.405 --> 01:25:18.865
Let's go.

01:25:29.959 --> 01:25:33.338
