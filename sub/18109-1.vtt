01:14.138 --> 01:17.308
<i>Once upon a time, a very long time ago...</i>

01:17.408 --> 01:20.590
<i>...back when the first vamps
showed up, there was a man.</i>

01:20.690 --> 01:23.665
- <i>Mister.</i>
- <i>Yeah, Mister.</i>

01:23.765 --> 01:27.118
Well, Mister was the best hunter
that there ever was...

01:27.218 --> 01:30.509
...and he traveled the Stakelands,
killing vamps.

01:30.609 --> 01:32.668
And then one day...

01:32.768 --> 01:34.392
...he came upon this boy.

01:34.492 --> 01:36.027
He was in real trouble.

01:36.127 --> 01:39.198
You see there was a big bad vamp
that was gonna eat him up.

01:39.298 --> 01:43.001
- No.
- Yeah, but Mister showed up...

01:43.101 --> 01:45.373
...and they staked that vamp
right through his heart.

01:45.473 --> 01:47.272
Yay!

01:47.872 --> 01:49.408
And after that...

01:49.508 --> 01:53.645
...they came up north
and they met a girl...

01:53.745 --> 01:56.815
- Mommy!
- Yeah, it was Mommy.

01:57.615 --> 02:00.919
And the boy and this girl,
they fell in love...

02:01.019 --> 02:04.814
...and then... you came along.

02:11.463 --> 02:14.176
<i>What happened to Mister?</i>

02:15.100 --> 02:17.387
<i>I don't know, baby.</i>

02:18.504 --> 02:22.041
One day, I woke up and, uh, he was gone.

02:22.141 --> 02:25.436
I found this necklace
hanging on the side of a car.

02:26.246 --> 02:28.856
He left it so that
I'd always remember him.

02:36.723 --> 02:38.807
They're dead.

02:43.563 --> 02:45.799
You're alive.

02:45.899 --> 02:47.434
Act like it.

02:47.534 --> 02:49.985
I'll be right back, baby.

03:13.226 --> 03:14.786
Do you want me to come with you?

03:14.886 --> 03:17.564
No, not this time.
I want you to stay with her.

03:17.664 --> 03:19.066
- All right.
- Okay, bye.

03:19.166 --> 03:21.234
- Bye.
- Bye.

03:23.103 --> 03:25.256
They've got bezerkers!
They're gonna kills us all!

03:25.356 --> 03:28.171
Not me. So you stay close, you understand?

03:47.861 --> 03:51.447
- I want to stay.
- Hush, baby. You have to stay quiet.

03:53.367 --> 03:54.914
Martin?

03:59.806 --> 04:01.659
Martin?

04:49.992 --> 04:52.328
Put it away, boy.

04:52.428 --> 04:54.946
We don't do history.

05:23.526 --> 05:26.411
<i>The world didn't die with a bang.</i>

05:27.830 --> 05:30.299
<i>It died with a scream...</i>

05:30.999 --> 05:33.217
<i>...lots of them...</i>

05:34.970 --> 05:37.189
<i>...and I heard 'em all.</i>

05:41.244 --> 05:43.595
<i>There's nothing left.</i>

05:43.947 --> 05:46.384
<i>A dying landscape.</i>

05:47.084 --> 05:50.602
<i>People stopped trying
to rebuild a long time ago.</i>

05:51.902 --> 05:54.523
<i>We let it all fall apart...</i>

05:55.525 --> 05:59.736
<i>...and now everything's quiet, empty.</i>

06:01.098 --> 06:04.374
<i>You can go for weeks
without finding a soul.</i>

06:05.835 --> 06:09.006
<i>Days come and night falls...</i>

06:09.106 --> 06:11.375
<i>...and we survive...</i>

06:11.475 --> 06:13.731
<i>...or we die.</i>

06:14.861 --> 06:16.930
<i>All you really got are memories...</i>

06:17.030 --> 06:20.708
<i>...and tomorrow, if you're lucky.</i>

06:22.385 --> 06:25.490
<i>New Eden was the only home I had left.</i>

06:25.590 --> 06:27.402
<i>And she...</i>

06:28.059 --> 06:30.301
<i>...she took it from me.</i>

06:30.895 --> 06:33.465
<i>The Brotherhood called her "The Mother."</i>

06:34.365 --> 06:37.976
<i>Those vamp worshipers
finally found their messiah...</i>

06:38.586 --> 06:42.163
<i>...the one sent to wipe
the Earth clean of sin.</i>

06:43.708 --> 06:48.152
<i>I was heading south into the Stakelands.</i>

06:50.315 --> 06:54.359
<i>If he was still alive,
that's where I'd find him.</i>

06:59.624 --> 07:01.466
<i>Mister.</i>

07:03.694 --> 07:06.504
<i>The closest thing to family I had.</i>

07:11.003 --> 07:13.365
<i>People knew of him...</i>

07:13.465 --> 07:17.115
<i>...of his one-man war against
the Brotherhood and the vamps.</i>

07:17.609 --> 07:19.852
<i>He was legend.</i>

07:20.712 --> 07:23.088
<i>He's the last hunter.</i>

07:25.884 --> 07:28.253
<i>If I wanted to get to her...</i>

07:28.353 --> 07:30.663
<i>...I was gonna need his help.</i>

12:47.779 --> 12:49.988
Drop it, son.

12:54.186 --> 12:58.490
They've been coming out earlier,
chancing the light...

12:58.890 --> 13:01.166
...getting desperate.

13:01.493 --> 13:03.729
Where are you coming from?

13:03.829 --> 13:06.999
Up north, New Eden.

13:07.099 --> 13:09.568
You're a long way from home.

13:09.868 --> 13:11.670
What are you doing here?

13:11.770 --> 13:15.474
I'm looking for someone.
He's called Mister.

13:15.574 --> 13:17.841
Yeah, heard of him.

13:17.941 --> 13:20.152
Thought he was dead.

13:20.412 --> 13:22.881
The poor boy looks hungry.

13:22.981 --> 13:25.918
You try anything, son,
I'll cut you in half.

13:26.018 --> 13:30.060
Oh, shush, Karl.
Can't you see he's a nice boy?

13:30.923 --> 13:34.260
Come on.
She won't be satisfied till you're fed.

13:34.360 --> 13:38.456
It'll be dark soon anyway.
Best get inside.

14:03.656 --> 14:06.192
It's good, ma'am, thank you.

14:06.292 --> 14:11.231
Sorry there's no meat.
We got to make do with what we have.

14:11.331 --> 14:14.201
You, uh... you're not eating?

14:14.634 --> 14:16.843
We ate already.

14:20.207 --> 14:22.983
Our boy Walter went to Canada...

14:23.644 --> 14:26.024
...had a child up there...

14:26.124 --> 14:28.359
...never came back.

14:28.983 --> 14:32.823
Maybe you know of him. Walter Armstrong?

14:32.923 --> 14:35.822
Come on, Jean. It's been years.

14:35.922 --> 14:38.827
Walter's dead or as good as.

14:39.227 --> 14:42.597
Give up hope,
you might as well lay down and die.

14:42.897 --> 14:46.133
The boy's lost and alone
in a world of woe...

14:46.233 --> 14:48.856
...and yet here he is
looking for something.

14:48.956 --> 14:51.179
That's hope.

14:52.072 --> 14:54.375
Times like these...

14:54.975 --> 14:57.318
...it's all we got to keep us going.

14:59.814 --> 15:02.857
Make up Walter's bed for him, Karl.

15:07.756 --> 15:10.119
Thank you, ma'am.

15:12.394 --> 15:15.270
Bad things happen to good people.

15:15.931 --> 15:18.266
The world ain't fair...

15:19.066 --> 15:21.109
...never will be.

15:22.604 --> 15:25.180
But there's good to be found.

15:51.699 --> 15:54.504
People pass through now and again.

15:54.604 --> 16:00.440
I get what news they have, update
my maps, write down their stories.

16:01.043 --> 16:02.918
Why?

16:03.379 --> 16:05.039
Just a hobby.

16:05.498 --> 16:08.350
Who knows, if this thing ever ends...

16:08.450 --> 16:10.994
...people might want to know
what happened.

16:16.025 --> 16:20.530
Yeah, strange times we're living in.

16:20.930 --> 16:24.206
It's the New Dark Ages,
that's what this is.

16:27.036 --> 16:30.172
- You okay, son?
- Yeah, I just gotta...

16:30.272 --> 16:32.849
Whoa, you should sit down.

16:39.542 --> 16:42.126
Yeah, strange times.

16:45.622 --> 16:47.965
You seem pretty tired.

16:49.726 --> 16:52.803
Probably best you sleep right here.

17:12.148 --> 17:14.958
Oh, no, Jean! Honey!

17:15.352 --> 17:18.662
Oh, honey, I'm so...

17:50.454 --> 17:53.691
<i>Brothers, sisters...</i>

17:54.291 --> 17:57.061
<i>...the mother of our blood has risen.</i>

17:57.161 --> 17:59.764
<i>The devout will be saved.</i>

17:59.864 --> 18:02.633
<i>The heretics will die.</i>

18:02.733 --> 18:06.104
<i>Join us. Join us.</i>

18:06.204 --> 18:08.205
<i>Brothers and sisters...</i>

18:08.305 --> 18:11.209
<i>...we build a world in her image.</i>

18:11.509 --> 18:16.348
<i>You need not be sick, hungry, tired.</i>

18:16.448 --> 18:21.443
<i>The Brotherhood will clothe you,
feed you, shelter you.</i>

18:21.543 --> 18:24.890
<i>The Mother's love knows no bounds.</i>

18:24.990 --> 18:26.658
<i>Join us.</i>

18:26.758 --> 18:30.896
<i>The Brotherhood serves her and her alone.</i>

18:30.996 --> 18:34.233
<i>Brothers, sisters...</i>

18:34.733 --> 18:37.602
<i>...the mother of our blood has risen.</i>

18:37.702 --> 18:40.271
<i>The devout will be saved.</i>

18:40.371 --> 18:43.108
<i>The heretics will die.</i>

18:43.208 --> 18:46.578
<i>Join us. Join us.</i>

18:46.678 --> 18:48.681
<i>Brothers and sisters...</i>

18:48.781 --> 18:51.883
<i>...we build a world in her image.</i>

18:51.983 --> 18:53.986
<i>You need not be sick...</i>

18:54.086 --> 18:56.929
<i>...hungry, tired...</i>

18:57.456 --> 18:59.491
Hey there.

18:59.591 --> 19:02.201
Shit, man, you scared me.

19:03.029 --> 19:06.372
- Where are you coming from?
- Canada.

19:07.200 --> 19:09.008
Whoa.

19:11.537 --> 19:13.780
How's things here?

19:16.458 --> 19:18.269
Quiet.

19:22.899 --> 19:24.617
What do you got for trade?

19:24.717 --> 19:27.854
You keep that.
I'm just looking for somebody.

19:27.954 --> 19:30.590
Yeah, nobody here but me.

19:40.700 --> 19:44.524
You... you looking for the hunter.

19:45.171 --> 19:48.948
Yeah, you and them Brotherhood boys.

19:50.411 --> 19:53.000
Oh, they don't like him much.

19:53.100 --> 19:57.008
- No, sir.
- What about you? You seen him?

20:00.153 --> 20:02.462
Yeah, yeah.

20:02.990 --> 20:05.832
- Yeah, I seen him.
- Where?

20:09.664 --> 20:11.839
A few months back.

20:13.868 --> 20:17.512
- Where was he headed?
- Lockdown.

20:18.839 --> 20:20.681
West...

20:21.108 --> 20:23.344
towards, uh, Donnersville.

20:23.444 --> 20:26.520
Donnersville? Where is that?
How do I get there?

20:27.131 --> 20:31.335
The quickest way is up 71,
past the old brick plant.

20:31.435 --> 20:33.453
Good folk, yeah.

20:33.553 --> 20:36.690
That's the only safe place
around these parts.

20:36.790 --> 20:39.411
Okay, all right. Well, thank you
very much for your help.

20:39.511 --> 20:42.321
See you around, Canada.

21:32.564 --> 21:34.439
Hi.

21:35.583 --> 21:38.260
Don't worry, sweetheart,
I'm not gonna hurt you.

21:39.120 --> 21:42.526
I'm Martin. What's your name?

21:57.372 --> 22:00.782
<i>Most of the good in the world is gone.</i>

22:06.982 --> 22:08.791
<i>Hate...</i>

22:10.685 --> 22:14.193
<i>...hate seems to be the only thing
that grows anymore.</i>

22:20.680 --> 22:23.557
<i>You don't need fangs to be monster.</i>

22:29.905 --> 22:32.314
<i>They're worse than the vamps.</i>

22:34.177 --> 22:36.652
<i>They chose this.</i>

23:23.210 --> 23:25.045
Ladies and gentlemen...

23:25.145 --> 23:28.346
...feast your eyes on the Behemoth!

23:32.803 --> 23:36.741
But first, an appetizer of mayhem...

23:36.841 --> 23:42.179
...a mano-a-mano no-rules death match!

23:42.279 --> 23:45.783
And now, the bane of bezerkers...

23:45.933 --> 23:49.407
...the viceroy of violence...

23:49.507 --> 23:53.791
...the undefeated... the Stakelander!

24:15.446 --> 24:17.162
Mister?

24:17.262 --> 24:19.157
Mister.

24:19.684 --> 24:22.026
Mister, it's me.

24:43.208 --> 24:45.384
It's me, you fucking idiot.

25:02.795 --> 25:04.540
Martin?

25:04.640 --> 25:06.408
Yes!

25:18.877 --> 25:20.933
Fight or die!

26:30.618 --> 26:32.086
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

26:32.186 --> 26:34.828
- What?
- Back up.

26:40.694 --> 26:43.004
It's a precaution.

27:07.956 --> 27:10.175
Was it Brotherhood?

27:18.033 --> 27:20.409
It was a she-vamp.

27:27.776 --> 27:30.385
<i>She was working with the Brotherhood.</i>

27:30.946 --> 27:33.315
<i>They ambushed us...</i>

27:33.415 --> 27:35.657
<i>...came out of nowhere.</i>

27:36.918 --> 27:40.222
<i>She had other vamps with her, bezerkers...</i>

27:40.322 --> 27:42.627
<i>...and they were organized...</i>

27:42.727 --> 27:45.101
<i>...like an army...</i>

27:47.530 --> 27:50.877
<i>...like she had some kind
of control over them.</i>

27:51.467 --> 27:54.210
<i>I've never seen anything like it.</i>

27:57.300 --> 28:00.581
<i>I tried to save them, but...</i>

28:19.095 --> 28:21.337
Can we kill her?

28:24.000 --> 28:28.372
You've got your whole life to die, kid.
No point in rushing it.

28:29.305 --> 28:31.380
Let it go.

28:32.341 --> 28:34.434
I can't.

28:34.678 --> 28:37.754
A man spends his life on revenge...

28:38.415 --> 28:41.058
...he might as well dig two graves.

28:42.403 --> 28:44.645
I did.

28:46.923 --> 28:49.466
We named our daughter Belle.

28:51.395 --> 28:53.837
You remember Belle?

28:54.831 --> 28:57.261
I remember everybody, kid.

28:58.735 --> 29:00.945
Most of them are dead.

29:38.669 --> 29:40.516
Hey...

29:40.616 --> 29:44.546
...I want to be on the road
in about an hour.

29:44.646 --> 29:47.368
I don't know what the hurry is, kid.

29:49.530 --> 29:51.499
What is with her?

29:51.599 --> 29:53.501
She's feral.

29:53.901 --> 29:56.436
Probably raised herself up in the wilds.

29:56.536 --> 29:58.979
I've seen it before.

30:05.573 --> 30:07.288
Hey.

30:11.119 --> 30:14.463
Come here. Come here. It's okay.

30:15.223 --> 30:17.832
That's it, now...

30:18.426 --> 30:20.770
There you go.

30:31.807 --> 30:34.883
It's music. It's good.

30:41.683 --> 30:43.618
That's it.

30:43.718 --> 30:45.504
Yeah.

30:51.443 --> 30:53.885
Martin, move the table!

30:59.669 --> 31:02.701
- In there? And the weapons!
- Yep, in the hole.

31:02.801 --> 31:05.708
No, in the hole!
Girl, come on, come on! Move!

31:05.808 --> 31:09.118
That a girl, down there. Down there!

31:11.680 --> 31:13.723
Martin, here.

31:14.250 --> 31:17.693
No, no, no, wait!
Wait, what are you doing?

31:17.820 --> 31:19.856
He's in here! Get that motherfucker!

31:26.328 --> 31:29.672
<i>Brothers, sisters...</i>

31:30.667 --> 31:32.975
Goddamn it!

31:35.004 --> 31:37.440
No. No, no, no, no, no.

31:37.540 --> 31:41.310
Don't worry. Mister ain't easy to kill and
they haven't seen us. We'll get him back.

31:42.010 --> 31:43.853
Come on.

33:37.096 --> 33:39.371
Oh, shit.

33:52.489 --> 33:54.633
You motherfucker.

34:41.594 --> 34:44.030
I hate vampires.

35:05.719 --> 35:07.928
Are there any more?

35:08.489 --> 35:12.393
I hope not. Oh, nice shot, kid.

35:12.493 --> 35:14.419
She put a claw in me.

35:16.630 --> 35:19.500
- All right, we got to get it out.
- No.

35:19.824 --> 35:23.865
- It's plugging a hole.
- Yeah, but you're gonna bleed to death.

35:24.539 --> 35:26.881
You're gonna have to cauterize it.

35:29.110 --> 35:31.879
There's a lockdown north of here.

35:32.330 --> 35:34.029
They got a doctor.

35:41.589 --> 35:44.259
Oh, stop your crying.

35:44.359 --> 35:46.835
I ain't dead yet, woman.

35:48.513 --> 35:51.724
I'm ready, kid. Slap iron to it.

36:40.583 --> 36:42.752
Find him.

36:42.852 --> 36:45.221
Bring that heathen son of a bitch back.

36:45.321 --> 36:47.396
Yes, sir.

36:49.125 --> 36:50.934
Sir!

37:18.489 --> 37:20.491
I'm sorry, Mother.

37:21.291 --> 37:23.333
He escaped.

37:26.430 --> 37:28.672
I don't know how.

37:29.566 --> 37:31.602
He, uh...

37:32.002 --> 37:33.841
He had help.

37:38.342 --> 37:40.584
He won't get far.

37:41.178 --> 37:43.654
I've sent men after him.

37:50.554 --> 37:54.831
My humblest apologies,
mother of our blood.

37:56.026 --> 37:58.301
Please forgive me.

38:21.303 --> 38:24.556
You ought to leave me here, kid.
I'm slowing you down.

38:24.656 --> 38:26.341
All right, shut up.

38:26.441 --> 38:29.460
I got your back, pappy.
I ain't going anywhere.

38:29.560 --> 38:31.610
I got your pappy swinging.

38:32.581 --> 38:34.682
I saw a willow tree a little ways back.

38:34.782 --> 38:37.555
Try to cut some bark,
maybe it'll help with your pain.

38:42.624 --> 38:44.699
Hey, girl.

38:53.602 --> 38:55.537
I'm Mister.

38:55.637 --> 38:57.513
Mister.

38:57.773 --> 39:00.783
Your name is Lady.

39:01.511 --> 39:05.084
Mister, Lady.

39:07.283 --> 39:09.525
You understand?

39:16.926 --> 39:19.495
Well, now, isn't this sweet?

39:19.595 --> 39:22.030
Move and you die, Hunter.

39:22.330 --> 39:24.367
I see you got yourself a squaw doggie.

39:24.467 --> 39:27.034
He's a little old for you, no?

39:30.739 --> 39:34.587
Whoo. Ooh, I never had
a feral brat before.

39:34.687 --> 39:36.746
I bet you she bites.

39:39.583 --> 39:41.525
You little bitch!

39:43.387 --> 39:45.729
Oh, now you're gonna pay.

39:54.431 --> 39:56.339
Drop it.

39:57.534 --> 40:00.110
I said drop it or meet Jesus.

40:07.310 --> 40:09.146
Martin!

40:09.246 --> 40:11.148
No.

40:11.248 --> 40:13.624
He's just a boy.

40:17.220 --> 40:19.797
You! Come here.

40:21.024 --> 40:23.300
That's enough.

40:24.494 --> 40:26.904
How many behind you?

40:27.732 --> 40:32.086
It's just us. Me and the men you killed.

40:32.637 --> 40:34.339
I'm not one of them.

40:34.439 --> 40:37.408
I don't want to do any of this.

40:37.508 --> 40:41.289
- I... I really am not.
- You're wearing the fucking robe.

40:41.646 --> 40:45.416
They made me.
Said they'd feed me to the vamps.

40:45.516 --> 40:47.170
I swear.

40:47.270 --> 40:51.128
I'll do anything.
Please, I just don't want to die.

40:51.422 --> 40:54.059
You better not be lying, boy...

40:54.159 --> 40:57.184
...because I'm in
a dick-shooting mood today.

40:58.463 --> 41:00.198
Yes, sir.

41:09.340 --> 41:12.060
Ten years ago,
you'd have shot him already.

41:12.160 --> 41:16.538
- I don't like it.
- You don't have to like it.

41:27.359 --> 41:31.370
Over there. Come on. I want him closer.

41:40.438 --> 41:42.981
Okay, here. Here, here.

41:43.876 --> 41:46.211
You, on the ground.

41:46.311 --> 41:49.054
Hey, hey, on him.

42:17.677 --> 42:20.546
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's the... Hey!

42:20.646 --> 42:24.517
- You sure about that, boy?
- That's up to you.

42:29.823 --> 42:34.968
- Where'd you find a holy roller?
- We killed two of them. He surrendered.

42:36.262 --> 42:38.631
Why is he still alive?

42:38.731 --> 42:41.167
Because he wouldn't let me kill him.

42:41.567 --> 42:43.238
What's with him?

42:43.338 --> 42:47.047
He's got a vamp claw in his lung. Are you
gonna shoot us or are you gonna help us?

42:47.974 --> 42:50.044
What's his name?

42:50.444 --> 42:52.686
They call him Mister.

43:07.427 --> 43:09.674
Hey, whoa.

43:11.198 --> 43:13.016
It's Bat.

43:14.801 --> 43:17.111
You son of a bitch.

43:18.806 --> 43:22.576
- I thought you were dead.
- I look dead to you?

43:22.676 --> 43:26.153
Yeah, you look a little dead.

43:27.164 --> 43:29.701
How you doing, old timer?

43:29.801 --> 43:33.187
You call me old timer again,
you're gonna find out.

43:33.287 --> 43:35.428
Oh, I know.

43:36.591 --> 43:39.233
I'm so glad to see you.

43:39.928 --> 43:43.004
Don't worry. We'll get you fixed up.

43:58.313 --> 44:00.589
<i>There aren't a lot of lockdowns left.</i>

44:01.750 --> 44:04.252
<i>And the ones that are still around...</i>

44:04.352 --> 44:06.928
<i>...they ain't places you'd want to be.</i>

44:09.824 --> 44:12.350
<i>There's still good out there.</i>

44:12.827 --> 44:15.069
<i>I believe that.</i>

44:18.833 --> 44:21.476
<i>But it always finds you too late.</i>

44:27.243 --> 44:30.519
<i>They had walls, weapons.</i>

44:31.547 --> 44:34.123
<i>I should have been hopeful.</i>

44:35.451 --> 44:39.062
<i>For the first time in a long time,
something felt safe.</i>

44:39.889 --> 44:42.465
<i>But I couldn't rest...</i>

44:42.959 --> 44:45.268
<i>not while she was still out there.</i>

45:44.621 --> 45:47.073
We brought you something to eat.

45:50.861 --> 45:53.297
Just push it back out when you're done.

45:53.397 --> 45:55.805
Oh, thank you.

45:57.501 --> 46:00.745
Wait. What's your name?

46:02.640 --> 46:04.515
Billie.

46:05.142 --> 46:07.579
It's Billie?

46:07.879 --> 46:11.215
They named me after my uncle.

46:11.315 --> 46:14.358
It's nice. I like it.

46:14.986 --> 46:17.195
I'm Juda.

46:19.156 --> 46:21.399
I've got to go.

46:22.393 --> 46:24.735
It was nice to meet you.

46:25.229 --> 46:27.071
Bye.

46:43.881 --> 46:46.882
Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

46:47.152 --> 46:50.562
Easy, girl. He needs to rest now.

46:51.823 --> 46:54.247
- Hey, I'm Earl.
- How is he?

46:54.347 --> 46:56.234
He's...

46:56.895 --> 47:00.499
Well, he's mostly mean and ugly,
but I think he'll make it.

47:00.599 --> 47:03.775
He should be up and on his feet
in a couple of days.

47:04.903 --> 47:07.072
- So you're a doctor?
- Yeah, that I am.

47:07.172 --> 47:11.510
Well, I was a veterinarian, but since
the fall, I fix people up mostly.

47:11.610 --> 47:15.651
Flesh, blood, bone,
it's all the same shit.

47:15.981 --> 47:19.018
Mister said that you'd...
you'd patched him up before.

47:19.118 --> 47:23.952
That I did. Bat and I were with him
in Mexico back in the beginning.

47:25.457 --> 47:27.990
Come on, come with me.
I'll show you to your room.

47:28.090 --> 47:32.464
Hey, Lady. Lady, come on.

47:32.564 --> 47:35.109
Come on, come on.

50:36.673 --> 50:38.553
Juda?

50:40.122 --> 50:42.579
They ain't gonna let me out.

50:43.179 --> 50:47.501
- What are they gonna...
- are they gonna kill me?

50:49.766 --> 50:52.342
Hey, come on.

50:58.642 --> 51:00.250
Hey.

51:01.311 --> 51:02.699
Hi.

51:03.480 --> 51:07.917
You're gonna be okay. Just gotta
give 'em some time to soften up.

51:08.017 --> 51:11.194
Can't you... can't you just let me out?

51:12.021 --> 51:15.217
I mean, I don't want any trouble.

51:15.492 --> 51:18.134
I'll just run off, please.

51:19.829 --> 51:21.737
I can't.

51:22.565 --> 51:25.508
Please! Billie, don't go.

51:27.437 --> 51:30.173
Well, it's an old... it's an old convent.

51:30.273 --> 51:33.010
The Brotherhood took it from the nuns.
We took it from the Brotherhood.

51:33.110 --> 51:37.515
Now this was a ways back,
before they got so fucking organized.

51:37.615 --> 51:41.318
Everybody pulls their weight here.
We got... we got teachers.

51:41.418 --> 51:46.030
We got a couple of carpenters.
We got ex-military men.

51:46.323 --> 51:48.025
They're all good people.

51:48.125 --> 51:50.494
There's a barbed-wire fence,
surrounds the perimeter.

51:50.594 --> 51:55.066
It doesn't look like much,
but it's electrified, so that makes it fun.

51:55.166 --> 51:59.604
Yeah, we had a couple solar cells in New Eden,
but never could've drawn this much power.

51:59.704 --> 52:02.172
I got my twin girls for that.

52:02.272 --> 52:04.275
See these two genys?

52:04.375 --> 52:07.077
They power the whole damn fandango...

52:07.177 --> 52:10.788
...but you ain't even seen
my favorite part.

52:27.332 --> 52:30.245
- The shower's free.
- All right, Lady. It's your turn.

52:30.345 --> 52:33.338
Come on. Come on.

52:33.438 --> 52:35.447
Up you go.

52:37.041 --> 52:39.684
There's some clean clothes there for you.

52:58.563 --> 53:02.241
There you go. Go in. Go ahead, Lady.

53:05.203 --> 53:08.507
All right, all right.
Take it easy, goddamn it.

53:08.607 --> 53:10.569
How you feeling, old buddy?

53:10.669 --> 53:13.252
Oh, like a bucket of shit.

53:13.629 --> 53:17.300
- I could use a drink. You carrying?
- It's a little early, isn't it?

53:17.400 --> 53:21.644
- Not in China.
- Yup. You know me too well.

53:23.455 --> 53:25.358
- Here you go.
- Mexico.

53:25.458 --> 53:27.500
<i>MÃ©jico.</i>

53:31.230 --> 53:36.308
- How long do I have to lay here?
- Oh, I'd say just about a day or two.

53:36.669 --> 53:37.904
- Give me that.
- Why?

53:38.004 --> 53:40.980
This is for medicinal purposes only.

53:44.677 --> 53:47.680
Here, kid, you try it. Go ahead.

53:47.780 --> 53:50.533
Bat makes this stuff himself.

53:50.633 --> 53:54.254
- Make your balls bounce.
- Oh, yeah, that stuff's nasty.

53:54.354 --> 53:56.590
Nasty, nasty.

53:56.690 --> 53:59.700
- Let's the man rest a bit.
- Yeah.

54:00.711 --> 54:02.932
- Real good to see you again.
- Good to see you, Bat.

54:03.032 --> 54:04.421
Yeah.

54:06.466 --> 54:09.840
- Come on, you too, little girl.
- Nah, leave her. Thanks, Doc.

54:09.940 --> 54:13.707
Yeah. Let me know if you need
anything for the pain.

54:13.807 --> 54:15.749
Yeah.

54:35.328 --> 54:37.170
Juda?

54:37.965 --> 54:40.240
You feeling all right?

54:41.334 --> 54:43.144
Juda?

54:47.442 --> 54:49.884
Oh, my God! Juda!

55:08.996 --> 55:14.052
When, uh, Mexico went vamp shit,
we pulled out. We headed north.

55:16.003 --> 55:18.312
Mister had a wife...

55:18.706 --> 55:22.216
...and a child close to the border.

55:24.412 --> 55:27.014
It wasn't pretty down south.

55:27.114 --> 55:29.164
It was bad...

55:29.264 --> 55:31.526
...bad as it gets.

55:32.421 --> 55:35.828
So bad that something
snapped inside that man.

55:36.792 --> 55:38.794
It's like a...

55:38.894 --> 55:41.103
...like a switch.

55:42.164 --> 55:44.840
All he wanted to do was kill.

55:45.934 --> 55:49.705
Well, he never got the one that killed
his family. So the way I figure it...

55:49.805 --> 55:52.225
...if he couldn't get the one...

55:52.325 --> 55:54.578
...he'd get 'em all.

55:56.028 --> 55:58.800
Oh, we stayed together for a while...

55:58.900 --> 56:01.256
...and then we split.

56:23.106 --> 56:25.943
He wanted to check on his folks
up in Maryland and...

56:26.843 --> 56:29.879
- ...Bat and I, we headed north...
- That's right.

56:29.979 --> 56:32.922
...with everybody else
who was running away.

56:33.183 --> 56:36.153
Yeah, and then the shit
hit the fan in the States.

56:36.253 --> 56:39.262
The whole fucking enchilada fell apart.

56:40.790 --> 56:43.033
And on that note...

56:44.828 --> 56:47.463
- ...how about we get another drink?
- Yeah, bubba.

56:47.563 --> 56:50.166
Man, I got ten o'clock watch.
I got to head up.

56:50.266 --> 56:53.836
Now you knock back
a couple for me, young buck.

56:56.806 --> 56:58.514
Yeah.

57:14.992 --> 57:17.801
- Hi.
- Hi.

57:20.030 --> 57:23.407
Thanks. Come on, honey. Come on.

57:42.086 --> 57:43.961
Boy!

57:52.760 --> 57:55.006
Son of a bitch.

58:07.178 --> 58:09.814
- Is Helios ready?
- Almost!

58:09.914 --> 58:13.552
- Who's Helios?
- Sunshine in the nighttime, baby.

58:13.752 --> 58:15.728
They're gonna run the fucking gate!

58:26.097 --> 58:30.475
Coming up quick! Coming up quick!
Somebody cover me! Helios, now!

58:33.405 --> 58:35.690
Burn, baby burn.

58:38.209 --> 58:40.886
That's Helios for your ass!

58:42.715 --> 58:45.157
Get away from the goddamned window.

58:45.918 --> 58:47.784
Shit.

58:47.884 --> 58:50.650
You stay here and don't you move.
You hear me?

58:50.960 --> 58:52.698
You better move!

59:34.835 --> 59:37.478
Oh, yeah, take your asses home.

59:39.038 --> 59:42.576
- Let me go. Let me go!
- It's not worth it, kid. She'll kill you.

59:42.676 --> 59:44.752
I don't care!

59:46.279 --> 59:48.088
I do.

01:00:16.275 --> 01:00:20.486
Helios held them back,
but we still lost six.

01:00:21.381 --> 01:00:24.057
Hey, look who we found.

01:00:27.521 --> 01:00:31.825
Oh, whoa... whoa, whoa, whoa.
Put him in the basement!

01:00:32.175 --> 01:00:36.853
Don't worry.
We're gonna squeeze him, slow.

01:00:37.631 --> 01:00:41.436
You were right. We should have killed
that holy roller when we had the chance.

01:00:41.536 --> 01:00:43.434
Amen.

01:00:51.228 --> 01:00:54.298
How many of you Jesus junkies
are out there?

01:00:54.398 --> 01:00:57.668
Plenty more. More than you could count.

01:00:57.768 --> 01:00:59.570
Huh?

01:00:59.970 --> 01:01:02.105
Where you camping?

01:01:02.205 --> 01:01:04.415
You're out of time.

01:01:05.143 --> 01:01:07.479
- What does it matter?
- Look, Juda.

01:01:07.579 --> 01:01:10.248
We can do this fast or we can do it slow.

01:01:10.348 --> 01:01:12.651
It's totally up to you.

01:01:12.751 --> 01:01:15.720
Everyone of you is gonna die...

01:01:15.820 --> 01:01:18.022
...and you can't win...

01:01:18.122 --> 01:01:20.792
...not while we've got God on our side.

01:01:20.892 --> 01:01:24.870
You know, it's the small nerves
that hurt the most.

01:01:24.970 --> 01:01:26.230
You know what I'm saying?

01:01:26.330 --> 01:01:31.318
And do you realize just how many
small nerves you've got in your fingertips?

01:01:31.418 --> 01:01:33.137
Hm?

01:01:33.237 --> 01:01:35.479
You got lots.

01:01:42.781 --> 01:01:45.017
God has sent them!

01:01:45.117 --> 01:01:48.359
God is great. God is in me.

01:01:48.887 --> 01:01:51.964
And she is his sword.

01:01:52.458 --> 01:01:54.660
Now, now, now, now.

01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:58.571
Who is this fang twat?
And what does she want with us anyway?

01:02:02.034 --> 01:02:04.277
She's after me.

01:02:08.106 --> 01:02:10.583
I wasn't sure last night.

01:02:10.876 --> 01:02:14.846
She's something new... a breeder.

01:02:16.449 --> 01:02:18.551
I killed her squirt a while back.

01:02:18.651 --> 01:02:20.493
I took her eye out.

01:02:22.588 --> 01:02:25.197
She used you to find me.

01:02:28.060 --> 01:02:30.269
I'm sorry, kid.

01:02:31.096 --> 01:02:33.139
That ain't worth shit, is it?

01:03:04.130 --> 01:03:06.473
Remind you of someone?

01:03:08.835 --> 01:03:12.450
You better get your people
up the mountain before they get here.

01:03:21.781 --> 01:03:23.984
<i>Code one, code one.</i>

01:03:24.084 --> 01:03:27.923
<i>All personnel will evacuate at 1900 hours.</i>

01:03:28.023 --> 01:03:30.224
<i>Pack only what is necessary.</i>

01:03:30.324 --> 01:03:32.993
<i>Meet in the courtyard
for further instructions.</i>

01:03:33.093 --> 01:03:35.559
<i>This is an evacuation...</i>

01:03:54.181 --> 01:03:57.718
- You got a plan?
- Yup.

01:03:57.818 --> 01:04:01.362
I'm gonna wait until that bitch shows up,
then I'm gonna take it to her.

01:04:03.457 --> 01:04:05.893
Dying ain't much of a plan, boy.

01:04:05.993 --> 01:04:08.062
I really don't give a shit.

01:04:08.162 --> 01:04:11.589
Dead's dead,
so long as I take her with me.

01:04:18.941 --> 01:04:22.310
She wants to hurt me like I hurt her.

01:04:22.410 --> 01:04:24.886
Yup, and you're leaving.

01:04:35.523 --> 01:04:37.799
Yeah, maybe not.

01:04:39.694 --> 01:04:44.132
If I stay, we stake her ass
or we die trying.

01:04:44.232 --> 01:04:48.110
Either way, we buy these folks
some time to make it up the mountain.

01:04:53.174 --> 01:04:55.050
Okay.

01:04:55.677 --> 01:04:57.512
Okay.

01:04:57.612 --> 01:04:59.721
You and me.

01:05:00.350 --> 01:05:03.252
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:05:03.352 --> 01:05:07.026
You Stakelanders think you're gonna
do this on your own, just the two of you...

01:05:07.126 --> 01:05:09.392
...have all the fun?
You got another thing coming.

01:05:09.492 --> 01:05:11.327
Yeah.

01:05:11.427 --> 01:05:14.263
We've been running ever since Mexico.

01:05:14.363 --> 01:05:18.701
- Personally, I'm a little tired of it.
- This ain't your fight, Doc.

01:05:18.801 --> 01:05:20.870
Odds are, all four of us are going to die.

01:05:20.970 --> 01:05:24.307
Yeah, well, I hear
that's gonna happen anyway...

01:05:24.407 --> 01:05:27.083
...so why don't we make it count?

01:05:29.345 --> 01:05:31.441
Cheer up.

01:06:06.983 --> 01:06:09.286
Easy, easy.

01:06:10.419 --> 01:06:13.691
Okay. I'm sorry.

01:06:36.647 --> 01:06:39.924
We got it all wired up. It's good to go.

01:06:41.586 --> 01:06:44.082
The blood bags won't know what hit 'em.

01:06:44.556 --> 01:06:48.993
If anybody's left when it's over,
head for the mountains.

01:06:49.393 --> 01:06:51.129
Yeah.

01:06:51.729 --> 01:06:54.726
Let's kill some
goddamned bloodsuckers, eh?

01:06:55.133 --> 01:06:57.402
Watch your back.

01:07:14.619 --> 01:07:16.928
Is she gonna be all right?

01:07:23.128 --> 01:07:25.571
My daughter's name was Rose.

01:08:09.808 --> 01:08:12.779
Are you sure you're gonna
be able to shoot straight?

01:08:13.980 --> 01:08:16.578
Couldn't shoot straight without it.

01:08:19.085 --> 01:08:20.987
What the hell?

01:08:21.087 --> 01:08:23.562
- They're coming from the back.
- Jeez, it's moving through here.

01:08:23.662 --> 01:08:26.917
Come on, move it!
Stay here, watch the gear.

01:08:49.081 --> 01:08:50.956
Okay.

01:08:54.653 --> 01:08:57.122
She's gonna pull a fast one on us.

01:08:57.223 --> 01:09:00.981
Yeah, well, they can come
and get it anyway they want.

01:09:08.118 --> 01:09:11.377
Let's wait till they're close.
We don't want to waste ammo.

01:09:40.166 --> 01:09:44.397
What the hell are they doing?
Why are they stopping?

01:09:47.875 --> 01:09:49.877
I don't give a shit.

01:09:49.977 --> 01:09:51.966
Let's light 'em up.

01:09:52.066 --> 01:09:55.907
We got a runner! Up front! Hey!

01:09:57.451 --> 01:09:59.670
He's heading for the geny!

01:10:00.317 --> 01:10:01.663
Hey!

01:10:03.190 --> 01:10:05.465
Get your ass...

01:10:11.098 --> 01:10:13.407
Well, shit.

01:10:20.607 --> 01:10:24.251
Okay. Get up front. Get up front!

01:10:40.661 --> 01:10:42.529
Hey!

01:10:45.767 --> 01:10:48.994
Come on! Come on, get up!
Lead 'em this way!

01:10:59.414 --> 01:11:01.116
Come on, you bitch!

01:11:03.685 --> 01:11:07.295
You want me? Come and get some!

01:11:43.192 --> 01:11:45.408
Keep going, this way.

01:12:05.248 --> 01:12:07.489
You missed her heart, goddamn it!

01:12:42.319 --> 01:12:44.821
- Shit!
- Damn!

01:12:46.523 --> 01:12:49.158
- We're pinned down, man.
- If we get out...

01:12:50.361 --> 01:12:52.729
- We're not getting out of this one.
- No, we ain't.

01:12:52.829 --> 01:12:54.498
You got to do it.

01:12:54.598 --> 01:12:56.734
- I got to do it.
- You have to do it.

01:13:17.122 --> 01:13:19.330
I'm over here, bitch.

01:13:44.049 --> 01:13:46.025
Finish her, kid.

01:14:06.372 --> 01:14:08.614
You feel better?

01:14:12.177 --> 01:14:14.053
No.

01:14:14.513 --> 01:14:16.956
But I don't feel worse.

01:14:18.417 --> 01:14:20.393
I feel like shit.

01:14:21.153 --> 01:14:23.606
You look like shit.

01:14:36.919 --> 01:14:41.023
It's been a great ride, Bat.
It's been a great ride.

01:14:41.191 --> 01:14:43.083
I love you.

01:14:43.333 --> 01:14:45.563
I love you.

01:14:47.213 --> 01:14:50.157
Now let's take these bloodsuckers to hell.

01:15:00.927 --> 01:15:03.170
Come on, old man.

01:15:52.947 --> 01:15:54.849
She's gone.

01:15:54.949 --> 01:15:57.457
- She's gone.
- No.

01:16:01.856 --> 01:16:05.059
Lady, it's me.

01:16:05.159 --> 01:16:07.269
It's Mister.

01:16:12.201 --> 01:16:14.276
You know me.

01:16:19.725 --> 01:16:22.000
Easy, girl.

01:16:55.444 --> 01:16:57.687
No, girl.

01:17:00.650 --> 01:17:02.302
No, no, no, no, no.

01:17:06.489 --> 01:17:08.331
No.

01:17:16.733 --> 01:17:18.574
Mm...

01:17:21.337 --> 01:17:23.346
Mister...

01:17:33.699 --> 01:17:35.375
No.

01:18:39.967 --> 01:18:42.577
I can't do this anymore, kid.

01:18:45.239 --> 01:18:47.781
Don't even think about it.

01:18:51.145 --> 01:18:54.554
- I'll buy you as much time as I can.
- No.

01:18:54.854 --> 01:18:57.291
No, I'm gonna stay, and we'll fight.

01:19:05.059 --> 01:19:07.600
A man wants his son...

01:19:08.917 --> 01:19:11.345
...to be better than he is.

01:19:26.214 --> 01:19:28.089
Get.

01:19:39.260 --> 01:19:41.837
<i>I don't know what happened to him.</i>

01:19:44.416 --> 01:19:46.892
<i>I guess it doesn't matter.</i>

01:19:49.838 --> 01:19:52.481
<i>But I know I'll see him again...</i>

01:19:55.394 --> 01:19:57.836
<i>...in this hell or the next.</i>
