{\an1}&gt;&gt; OF COURSE I DO.

07:58.811 --> 08:00.897

{\an1}&gt;&gt; IT IS.

08:20.499 --> 08:21.167
{\an1}&gt;&gt; BUT ANOTHER POF ME

08:21.250 --> 08:22.043
{\an1}DOESN'T WANNA GET

09:04.752 --> 09:05.670
{\an1}THAT'S ODD.

09:05.753 --> 09:07.713
{\an1}THE SOLVENT IS HAVING A REACTION

09:07.797 --> 09:10.341
{\an1}TO THE BASE COMPOUND.

09:10.424 --> 09:12.426

{\an1}USE THE GLUE

09:18.099 --> 09:19.225
{\an1}ON THE BACK OF THE ENVELOPE?

09:19.308 --> 09:20.268
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THE JAMESON 5000 WILL BE

{\an1}SEVEN HUNDRED TIMES STRONGER.

09:22.937 --> 09:23.479
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WON'T THAT MAKE IT

09:23.562 --> 09:24.397
{\an1}HARDER TO OPEN?

09:24.480 --> 09:25.147
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YES,

{\an1}PHONE CALLS I ASKED YOU TO?

09:34.657 --> 09:35.408
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NOPE.

09:38.202 --> 09:39.036
{\an1}THAT THE RAINCOATS

09:39.120 --> 09:39.745
{\an1}WON'T BE READY.

09:39.829 --> 09:41.455
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH, WELL THAT DOES

10:09.317 --> 10:11.777

{\an1}IT'S MADE FROM HIGH-PURITY

10:18.117 --> 10:18.951
{\an1}AMORPHOUS SILICA FIBERS

10:19.035 --> 10:19.285

10:19.368 --> 10:20.494
{\an1}WITH A TWO-COMPONENT ALLOY

10:20.578 --> 10:21.537
{\an1}TO KEEP THE THERMAL EXPANSION

10:21.620 --> 10:23.331
{\an1}ACCEPTABLY LOW.

10:23.414 --> 10:24.582
{\an1}&gt;&gt; JUST AS I SUSPECTED.

10:24.665 --> 10:25.583
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YEAH, IT'S WHAT THEY MAKE

10:25.666 --> 10:27.710
{\an1}THE SPACE SHUTTLE OUT OF.

10:27.793 --> 10:29.837
{\an1}ALTHOUGH I MISCALCULATED

10:29.920 --> 10:30.629
{\an1}SLIGHTLY ON THE COST.

10:30.713 --> 10:31.672
{\an1}THE HANDLE ALONE COSTS

10:31.756 --> 10:35.384
{\an1}FOURTEEN HUNDRED SMACKERS.

10:35.468 --> 10:41.057
{\an1}YOU'RE PECULIAR, AREN'T YOU?

10:41.140 --> 10:41.724
{\an1}&gt;&gt; SAY, TRUE, HAVE YOU THOUGHT

10:41.807 --> 10:42.058
{\an1}OF ANY SOLUTIONS

10:42.141 --> 10:44.727
{\an1}FOR OUR LITTLE RAINCOAT FIASCO?

10:44.810 --> 10:46.812
{\an1}NOT REALLY, HOW ABOUT YOU?

10:46.896 --> 10:47.938
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NOTHING.

10:48.022 --> 10:48.606
{\an1}THE BEST I COULD COME UP

10:48.689 --> 10:49.148

{\an1}WE HAVE WITH MATCHING UMBRELLAS.

10:50.649 --> 10:52.610

{\an1}&gt;&gt; IT IS? I MEAN, YES,

10:55.488 --> 10:56.739
{\an1}I THINK SO.

10:56.822 --> 10:57.782

10:57.865 --> 10:59.325
{\an1}IS TWEED.

10:59.408 --> 11:00.201
{\an1}IF WE MADE THE UMBRELLAS

11:00.284 --> 11:01.035
{\an1}IN THE SAME PATTERN,

11:01.118 --> 11:02.745
{\an1}WE COULD SELL THEM AS A PAIR.

11:02.828 --> 11:04.872
{\an1}"WHAT THE WELL-DRESSED EXEC

11:04.955 --> 11:05.122

{\an1}I MEAN, WHY WOULDN'T I?

11:09.043 --> 11:10.836
{\an1}IT'S MY IDEA.

11:10.920 --> 11:11.796
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I'LL TELL MY ASSISTANT

11:11.879 --> 11:13.130

{\an1}LET'S SEE HOW THE MAD PROFESSOR

11:15.049 --> 11:17.593

11:17.676 --> 11:24.517

11:41.742 --> 11:47.665
{\an1}CALL ME BACK, I'M BORED.

11:47.748 --> 11:49.959
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH, NOT YOU GUYS.

11:50.042 --> 11:54.880
{\an1}YOU GUYS ARE THE BEST.

12:00.469 --> 12:00.803
{\an1}SHE'S JUST A KID.

12:00.886 --> 12:01.679
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHAT'S THE WALL?

12:01.762 --> 12:07.059
{\an1}&gt;&gt; CHECK IT OUT...

12:07.143 --> 12:08.060
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THE WALL.

12:08.144 --> 12:10.146
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THAT'S IT? A MATH PROBLEM?

12:10.229 --> 12:11.480
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NOT JUST ANY MATH PROBLEM.

12:11.564 --> 12:12.773
{\an1}THIS IS FULCRUM'S CONUNDRUM.

12:12.857 --> 12:13.691
{\an1}&gt;&gt; FULCRUM'S CONUNDRUM.

12:13.774 --> 12:15.192
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I JUST SAID THAT, CRAIG.

12:15.276 --> 12:21.574
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OKAY, LET ME GIVE IT A SHOT.

12:21.657 --> 12:22.241
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NOPE, IT'S TOO HARD.

12:22.324 --> 12:22.700
{\an1}MAYBE I'LL PLAY

12:22.783 --> 12:24.285
{\an1}A LITTLE SOLITAIRE.

12:24.368 --> 12:24.869
{\an1}&gt;&gt; SUIT YOURSELF.

12:24.952 --> 12:25.953
{\an1}&gt;&gt; SUIT YOURSELF.

12:26.036 --> 12:26.579
{\an1}&gt;&gt; CRAIG?

12:26.662 --> 12:37.840
{\an1}&gt;&gt; SORRY.

12:37.923 --> 12:39.175
{\an1}&gt;&gt; HEY, OSCAR,

12:39.258 --> 12:40.509
{\an1}HAVE YOU SEEN MY ASSISTANT?

12:40.593 --> 12:41.802
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YES, I BELIEVE HE'S--

12:41.886 --> 12:44.555
{\an1}&gt;&gt; RIGHT HERE, TRUE.

12:44.638 --> 12:45.181
{\an1}&gt;&gt; MR. JAMESON, DID YOU SET UP

12:45.264 --> 12:46.682
{\an1}THOSE MEETINGS I ASKED YOU TO?

12:46.765 --> 12:47.349
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NOPE.

12:47.433 --> 12:47.808
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WELL, DID YOU LET

12:47.892 --> 12:48.267
{\an1}MARKETING KNOW I NEED

12:48.350 --> 12:49.185
{\an1}TO TALK TO THEM

12:49.268 --> 12:49.727
{\an1}ABOUT THE RAINCOAT CAMPAIGN?

12:49.810 --> 12:50.811
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NOPE.

12:50.895 --> 12:52.438
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I DON'T WANT TO BE RUDE,

12:52.521 --> 12:52.771
{\an1}BUT I NEED YOU

12:52.855 --> 12:54.315
{\an1}TO DO THOSE THINGS A.S.A.P.

12:54.398 --> 12:55.024
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I'M ON IT.

12:55.107 --> 12:55.524
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THANKS.

12:55.608 --> 12:56.066
{\an1}&gt;&gt; RIGHT AFTER I'M DONE

12:56.150 --> 12:59.904
{\an1}FIXING THE ELEVATOR.

12:59.987 --> 13:06.911
{\an1}PERFECT.

13:06.994 --> 13:09.330
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I HAVE TO FIRE MY TEACHER.

13:09.413 --> 13:09.830
{\an1}&gt;&gt; SEE IF YOU CAN GET

13:09.914 --> 13:11.415
{\an1}MY SHOE BACK FIRST.

13:11.499 --> 13:20.049
{\an1}HE'S PUTTING A GPS IN IT.

13:20.132 --> 13:20.549
{\an1}&gt;&gt; HAVE YOU TRACKED DOWN

13:20.633 --> 13:22.176
{\an1}THE MATERIAL FOR THE UMBRELLAS?

13:22.259 --> 13:22.843
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NO.

13:22.927 --> 13:23.928
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHY NOT?

13:24.011 --> 13:25.054
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I'VE HAD A FEW ISSUES TODAY

13:25.137 --> 13:26.472
{\an1}WITH MY SUPPORT STAFF.

13:26.555 --> 13:26.931
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YOU MEAN THE LUNK

13:27.014 --> 13:29.225
{\an1}OUTSIDE YOUR OFFICE?

13:29.308 --> 13:29.642
{\an1}&gt;&gt; HE GAVE ME A MUG

13:29.725 --> 13:30.601
{\an1}THAT KEEPS COFFEE

13:30.684 --> 13:32.269
{\an1}SLIGHTLY HOTTER THAN THE SUN.

13:32.353 --> 13:33.020
{\an1}I FILLED IT OVER AN HOUR AGO

13:33.103 --> 13:33.938
{\an1}AND I STILL CAN'T GET IT

13:34.021 --> 13:34.396
{\an1}ANYWHERE NEAR MY FACE

13:34.480 --> 13:38.234
{\an1}WITHOUT SINGEING MY EYEBROWS.

13:38.317 --> 13:38.776
{\an1}I HAVE TO FIRE HIM.

13:38.859 --> 13:41.362
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THAT'S ROUGH.

13:41.445 --> 13:41.862
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I KNOW.

13:41.946 --> 13:43.364
{\an1}&gt;&gt; TAKE SOME PICTURES

13:43.447 --> 13:44.323
{\an1}WHEN HE STARTS TO CRY.

13:44.406 --> 13:47.451
{\an1}I NEED A NEW SCREENSAVER.

13:47.535 --> 13:48.035
{\an1}&gt;&gt; UH-HUH.

13:48.118 --> 13:49.745
{\an1}SO THAT'S WHY

13:49.828 --> 13:50.246
{\an1}THE ATOMIC SYMBOL FOR GOLD

13:50.329 --> 13:52.957
{\an1}IS AU AND NOT G.

13:53.040 --> 13:54.375
{\an1}DOES THAT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION?

13:54.458 --> 13:54.833
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NOT EVEN REMOTELY.

13:54.917 --> 13:56.293
{\an1}I ASKED WHERE YOU GOT

13:56.377 --> 13:58.504
{\an1}YOUR WATCH.

13:58.587 --> 13:58.963
{\an1}&gt;&gt; MR. JAMESON?

13:59.046 --> 14:00.589
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH, OH.

14:00.673 --> 14:01.423
{\an1}HI TRUE, YEAH I'M

14:01.507 --> 14:02.049
{\an1}JUST ABOUT TO GET A JUMP

14:02.132 --> 14:03.092
{\an1}ON THOSE ERRANDS YOU GAVE ME.

14:03.175 --> 14:03.926
{\an1}&gt;&gt; RIGHT, WELL, ABOUT THAT,

14:04.009 --> 14:05.469
{\an1}I NEED TO TALK TO YOU

14:05.553 --> 14:05.844
{\an1}ABOUT SOMETHING.

14:05.928 --> 14:07.555
{\an1}IT'S SORT OF BIG.

14:07.638 --> 14:07.805
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OKAY.

14:07.888 --> 14:09.515
{\an1}I HAVE SOMETHING BIG

14:09.598 --> 14:11.392
{\an1}TO TELL YOU TOO.

14:11.475 --> 14:14.144
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YOU WANT TO QUIT?

14:14.228 --> 14:16.146
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NO, NO, NO,

14:16.230 --> 14:17.106
{\an1}JUST THE OPPOSITE.

14:17.189 --> 14:17.523
{\an1}I'M HAVING THE TIME

14:17.606 --> 14:17.982
{\an1}OF MY LIFE HERE.

14:18.065 --> 14:20.442
{\an1}AND YOU, YOU'VE ALWAYS

14:20.526 --> 14:21.402
{\an1}BEEN A GREAT STUDENT,

14:21.485 --> 14:21.986
{\an1}BUT IT HAS BEEN AWE-INSPIRING

14:22.069 --> 14:23.445
{\an1}TO SEE WHAT A GREAT BOSS

14:23.529 --> 14:25.906
{\an1}YOU ARE TOO.

14:25.990 --> 14:29.118
{\an1}NOW, WHAT DO YOU WANT TO SAY?

14:29.201 --> 14:31.328
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I WAS WONDERING

14:31.412 --> 14:32.037
{\an1}IF THERE IS ANY WAY

14:32.121 --> 14:33.080
{\an1}YOU CAN MAKE MY OFFICE

14:33.163 --> 14:35.666
{\an1}FRIDGE COLDER&gt;

14:35.749 --> 14:36.041
{\an1}&gt;&gt; HOW ABOUT

14:36.125 --> 14:43.257
{\an1}SEVEN HUNDRED TIMES COLDER?

14:43.340 --> 14:43.882
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THAT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE

14:43.966 --> 14:52.016
{\an1}IT'S GOING TO BE COLDER.

14:52.099 --> 14:52.850
{\an1}&gt;&gt; DEEP DRIVE TO LEFT FIELD.

14:52.933 --> 14:54.393
{\an1}CARPENTER LOOKS UP AT THE WALL

14:54.476 --> 14:55.978
{\an1}AND IT IS GONE.

14:56.061 --> 14:57.271
{\an1}BRUCE ROBINSON HAS TAKEN

14:57.354 --> 14:57.938
{\an1}BEN -- DEEP--

14:58.022 --> 15:05.195
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH MAN, THAT IS GROSS.

15:05.279 --> 15:05.571
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YEAH, WE NEED

15:05.654 --> 15:08.490
{\an1}MORE APPLE SAUCE IN HERE, STAT.

15:08.574 --> 15:10.576
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WELL, IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND,

15:10.659 --> 15:12.953
{\an1}I'M FEELING A LITTLE BIT SLEEPY.

15:13.037 --> 15:15.247
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH, OF COURSE, OF COURSE.

15:15.331 --> 15:17.124
{\an1}REST IS IMPORTANT.

15:17.207 --> 15:17.541
{\an1}I BET YOU'LL WAKE UP

15:17.625 --> 15:19.001
{\an1}FEELING BETTER THAN EVER.

15:19.084 --> 15:20.669
{\an1}I'LL JUST TURN THIS LIGHT OFF.

15:20.753 --> 15:21.962
{\an1}[SCREAMS]

15:22.046 --> 15:30.846
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OKAY, BYE.

15:30.929 --> 15:31.472
{\an1}&gt;&gt; MR. MADIGAN,

15:31.555 --> 15:34.308
{\an1}I--WHOA IT'S WHITE IN HERE.

15:34.391 --> 15:35.392
{\an1}&gt;&gt; HOW'S IT GOING, TRUE?

15:35.476 --> 15:35.934
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I THINK AMANDA AND I

15:36.018 --> 15:36.435
{\an1}HAVE CUP WITH A SOLUTION

15:36.518 --> 15:37.853
{\an1}TO THE RAINCOAT PROBLEM.

15:37.936 --> 15:39.063
{\an1}&gt;&gt; GREAT.

15:39.146 --> 15:41.357
{\an1}&gt;&gt; BUT THAT'S NOT WHY I CAME IN.

15:41.440 --> 15:41.982
{\an1}I'M HAVING A LITTLE PROBLEM

15:42.066 --> 15:43.108
{\an1}WITH MY TEMP.

15:43.192 --> 15:44.276
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I DON'T THINK I COULD HANDLE

15:44.360 --> 15:47.363
{\an1}ANOTHER PROBLEM RIGHT NOW, TRUE.

15:47.446 --> 15:48.322
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHY, WHAT'S WRONG?

15:48.405 --> 15:48.697
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THE WHITE TIGER

15:48.781 --> 15:50.157
{\an1}I ORDERED FOR THE PHOTO SHOOT

15:50.240 --> 15:51.200
{\an1}HASN'T ARRIVED.

15:51.283 --> 15:52.242
{\an1}HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO LOOK

15:52.326 --> 15:53.535
{\an1}LIKE "JOE LUNCH PAIL"

15:53.619 --> 15:55.079
{\an1}WITHOUT A RARE ALBINO TIGER

15:55.162 --> 15:55.371
{\an1}AT MY FEET?

15:55.454 --> 15:57.498
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I'M SURE YOU MAKE DO.

15:57.581 --> 16:00.084
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THAT'S THE SPIRIT.

16:00.167 --> 16:02.002
{\an1}BUT I DO WONDER

16:02.086 --> 16:23.440
{\an1}WHERE THAT TIGER ENDED UP.

16:23.524 --> 16:24.483
{\an1}&gt;&gt; LULU, THERE YOU ARE.

16:24.566 --> 16:24.775
{\an1}HOW COME YOU

16:24.858 --> 16:25.526
{\an1}HAVEN'T BEEN ANSWERING

16:25.609 --> 16:26.026
{\an1}YOUR PHONE?

16:26.110 --> 16:26.819
{\an1}&gt;&gt; IF I CARRY THE FOUR,

16:26.902 --> 16:27.111
{\an1}I STILL NEED

16:27.194 --> 16:27.945
{\an1}A NEGATIVE INTEGER...

16:28.028 --> 16:29.279
{\an1}&gt;&gt; LULU, I NEED YOUR HELP.

16:29.363 --> 16:30.572
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NEGATIVE SEVEN OVER X.

16:30.656 --> 16:30.948
{\an1}NO, THAT DOESN'T

16:31.031 --> 16:31.323
{\an1}EVEN MAKE SENSE.

16:31.407 --> 16:32.741
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THAT'S THE PRETTIEST PONY

16:32.825 --> 16:33.117
{\an1}I'VE EVER SEEN?

16:33.200 --> 16:34.326
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHERE?

16:34.410 --> 16:36.495
{\an1}OH, HI TRUE.

16:36.578 --> 16:36.745
{\an1}&gt;&gt; LULU,

16:36.829 --> 16:37.287
{\an1}I HAVE TO FIRE MR. JAMESON,

16:37.371 --> 16:39.164
{\an1}BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT.

16:39.248 --> 16:39.873
{\an1}&gt;&gt; REMEMBER THE TIME

16:39.957 --> 16:40.416
{\an1}YOU FIRED ME?

16:40.499 --> 16:42.751
{\an1}THAT DIDN'T SEEM SO HARD.

16:42.835 --> 16:45.045
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YOU'VE GOT TO LET THAT GO.

16:45.129 --> 16:48.465
{\an1}&gt;&gt; SORRY, JUST COMPLIMENT HIM

16:48.549 --> 16:48.841
{\an1}ON ALL THE STUFF

16:48.924 --> 16:49.550
{\an1}HE'S GOOD AT FIRST,

16:49.633 --> 16:51.510
{\an1}AND THEN LET HIM DOWN EASY.

16:51.593 --> 16:52.761
{\an1}&gt;&gt; FOCUS ON THE POSITIVE.

16:52.845 --> 16:53.846
{\an1}&gt;&gt; RIGHT,

16:53.929 --> 16:54.388
{\an1}LIKE THE POSITIVE INTEGERS

16:54.471 --> 16:57.641
{\an1}IN FULCRUM'S CONUNDRUM.

16:57.725 --> 16:58.142
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I CAN'T UNDERSTAND

16:58.225 --> 16:59.143
{\an1}THAT THING AT ALL.

16:59.226 --> 17:03.105
{\an1}IT LOOKS UPSIDE DOWN TO ME.

17:03.188 --> 17:11.446
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WAIT A MINUTE.

17:11.530 --> 17:13.991
{\an1}&gt;&gt; SIXTEEN.

17:14.074 --> 17:17.368
{\an1}THE ANSWER IS SIXTEEN.

17:17.453 --> 17:18.162
{\an1}&gt;&gt; SHE IS RIGHT,

17:18.244 --> 17:20.622
{\an1}X EQUALS SIXTEEN.

17:20.705 --> 17:21.290
{\an1}&gt;&gt; FULCRUM'S CONUNDRUM

17:21.373 --> 17:21.665
{\an1}WAS THAT HE NAILED

17:21.749 --> 17:23.584
{\an1}THE BOARD UPSIDE DOWN.

17:23.666 --> 17:24.209
{\an1}HE HAD ONE NAIL

17:24.292 --> 17:25.502
{\an1}AND HE NAILED IT IN THE MIDDLE.

17:25.586 --> 17:26.377
{\an1}&gt;&gt; IN THE MIDDLE.

17:26.462 --> 17:32.968
{\an1}&gt;&gt; CRAIG, ENOUGH.

17:33.051 --> 17:34.344
{\an1}&gt;&gt; MR. JAMESON,

17:34.428 --> 17:35.679
{\an1}CAN I TALK TO YOU REAL FIRST?

17:35.763 --> 17:36.180
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I WOULD IMAGINE SO.

17:36.263 --> 17:37.347
{\an1}THE HUMAN MOUTH IS CAPABLE

17:37.431 --> 17:38.432
{\an1}OF MOVING AT A VELOCITY

17:38.515 --> 17:38.724
{\an1}OF NEARLY--

17:38.807 --> 17:42.478
{\an1}&gt;&gt; MR. JAMESON.

17:42.561 --> 17:43.562
{\an1}LOOK, YOU'RE AN INCREDIBLE

17:43.645 --> 17:44.271
{\an1}TEACHER AND SUCH

17:44.354 --> 17:45.272
{\an1}A GREAT INVENTOR.

17:45.355 --> 17:46.231
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I WISH THAT WERE TRUE.

17:46.315 --> 17:47.107
{\an1}BUT MY LATEST EXPERIMENT

17:47.191 --> 17:48.275
{\an1}IS A DISMAL FAILURE.

17:48.358 --> 17:48.984
{\an1}TAKE A LOOK AT MY SWEATER.

17:49.067 --> 17:49.359
{\an1}IT'S GREEN, RIGHT?

17:49.443 --> 17:50.319
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YEAH.

17:50.402 --> 17:50.778
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YEAH,

17:50.861 --> 17:51.570
{\an1}IT'S SUPPOSED TO TURN BLUE,

17:51.653 --> 17:52.362
{\an1}BUT THE WATER JUST BEADS UP

17:52.446 --> 17:53.113
{\an1}AND ROLLS RIGHT OFF.

17:53.197 --> 17:54.990
{\an1}THE JAMESON 5000 COLOR SWITCH

17:55.073 --> 17:55.991
{\an1}IS A DISASTER.

17:56.074 --> 17:57.201
{\an1}&gt;&gt; MR. JAMESON, LISTEN,

17:57.284 --> 17:58.577
{\an1}SOMETIMES A JOB

17:58.660 --> 17:59.161
{\an1}JUST ISN'T RIGHT FOR SOMEBODY.

17:59.244 --> 18:00.370
{\an1}AND I'M AFRAID

18:00.454 --> 18:02.748
{\an1}TO TELL YOU THAT--WAIT.

18:02.831 --> 18:02.998
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHAT?

18:03.081 --> 18:04.750
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OSCAR, CALL A CODE YELLOW

18:04.833 --> 18:06.335
{\an1}IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM.

18:06.418 --> 18:06.668
{\an1}COME WITH ME.

18:06.752 --> 18:07.586
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WELL ACTUALLY,

18:07.669 --> 18:08.170
{\an1}I'M KIND OF IN THE MIDDLE

18:08.253 --> 18:09.963
{\an1}OF SOME-OH BOY.

18:10.047 --> 18:17.429
{\an1}OKAY, OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

18:17.513 --> 18:17.679
{\an1}IN KEEPING

18:17.763 --> 18:19.139
{\an1}WITH THE ZARGHAMI PRINCIPLE,

18:19.223 --> 18:19.681
{\an1}WHEN THE LIQUIDS ARE HEATED

18:19.765 --> 18:20.307
{\an1}TO A LEVEL

18:20.390 --> 18:21.517
{\an1}GREATER THAN 28 KELVIN,

18:21.600 --> 18:22.976
{\an1}WE FIND THE BASE COMPOUND

18:23.060 --> 18:23.310
{\an1}DULY AFFECTED.

18:23.393 --> 18:26.105
{\an1}&gt;&gt; BAM, WHAT HE SAID?

18:26.188 --> 18:28.065
{\an1}&gt;&gt; SPEAKING OF WHICH,

18:28.148 --> 18:28.774
{\an1}WHAT DID HE SAY?

18:28.857 --> 18:30.275
{\an1}AND WHY I AM HERE?

18:30.359 --> 18:30.734
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHAT WOULD YOU SAY

18:30.818 --> 18:31.193
{\an1}IF I TOLD YOU

18:31.276 --> 18:33.445
{\an1}THAT MR. JAMESON HAS A SOLUTION

18:33.529 --> 18:34.112
{\an1}THAT COULD MAKE

18:34.196 --> 18:35.114
{\an1}ANY FABRIC WATERPROOF?

18:35.197 --> 18:36.782
{\an1}&gt;&gt; HUH, NOW THAT

18:36.865 --> 18:38.200
{\an1}I'D LIKE TO SEE.

18:38.283 --> 18:44.206
{\an1}[SCREAMS]

18:44.289 --> 18:46.875
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THAT'S AMAZING.

18:46.959 --> 18:49.294
{\an1}LOOK AT HER, DRY AS A BONE

18:49.378 --> 18:50.838
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YEAH, IF I MAY MAX,

18:50.921 --> 18:52.673
{\an1}I'M... WHAT'S THE WORD?

18:52.756 --> 18:54.216
{\an1}DRENCHED.

18:54.299 --> 18:55.634
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WELL, OF COURSE.

18:55.717 --> 18:55.926
{\an1}YOUR GARMENT

18:56.009 --> 18:57.302
{\an1}HASN'T BEEN TREATED.

18:57.386 --> 19:03.058
{\an1}BUT TRUE'S HERE HAS.

19:03.141 --> 19:05.394
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I CAN'T FEEL A THING.

19:05.477 --> 19:05.978
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I'M SORRY,

19:06.061 --> 19:07.479
{\an1}WHY EXACTLY WAS IT NECESSARY

19:07.563 --> 19:10.232
{\an1}TO THROW WATER ON ME?

19:10.315 --> 19:10.983
{\an1}&gt;&gt; QUIET, AMANDA.

19:11.066 --> 19:14.570
{\an1}YOU CAN'T ARGUE WITH SCIENCE.

19:14.653 --> 19:15.112
{\an1}&gt;&gt; AND THERE YOU HAVE IT.

19:15.195 --> 19:16.071
{\an1}WE CAN HAVE THE RAINCOATS

19:16.154 --> 19:17.364

{\an1}ON MONDAY, ON SCHEDULE.

19:23.787 --> 19:24.079
{\an1}&gt;&gt; BUT I THOUGHT

19:24.163 --> 19:25.414
{\an1}YOU CALLED ALL OUR DISTRIBUTERS

19:25.497 --> 19:26.331
{\an1}AND PUSHED BACK

19:27.416 --> 19:27.958
{\an1}&gt;&gt; LUCKY FOR US,

19:28.041 --> 19:29.376
{\an1}MR. JAMESON IS A GREAT INVENTOR

19:29.459 --> 19:30.127
{\an1}BUT A TERRIBLE ASSISTANT,

19:30.210 --> 19:32.546
{\an1}AND HE DIDN'T CALL ANYBODY.

19:32.629 --> 19:33.130
{\an1}RIGHT?

19:33.213 --> 19:34.590
{\an1}&gt;&gt; TRUTH BE TOLD,

19:34.673 --> 19:37.551

{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH, IS THAT A FULL-TIME JOB?

19:48.145 --> 19:49.021
{\an1}&gt;&gt; IT IS.

19:49.104 --> 19:51.023
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THEN I'LL HAVE TO PASS.

19:51.106 --> 19:52.858
{\an1}TEACHING IS MY LIFE.

19:52.941 --> 19:56.570
{\an1}IT'S A RESPONSIBILITY.JOB,

19:56.653 --> 19:58.363

{\an1}HE DIDN'T TAKE THE JOB HERE.

20:16.340 --> 20:17.883

{\an1}MY SCIENCE TEACHER.

20:19.009 --> 20:20.052
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I UNDERSTAND.

20:20.135 --> 20:20.636
{\an1}HE SEEMS LIKE

20:20.719 --> 20:23.263
{\an1}A PRETTY SPECIAL GUY.

20:23.347 --> 20:31.813
{\an1}AAAAAH, AAAAAH, AAAAAH.

{\an1}WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

20:33.023 --> 20:33.774
{\an1}THE ARTICLE DOESN'T MAKE ME

20:33.857 --> 20:35.150
{\an1}SEEM TOO ORDINARY, DOES IT?

20:35.233 --> 20:35.484
{\an1}&gt;&gt; ORDINARY?

20:35.567 --> 20:36.360
{\an1}&gt;&gt; HOW SO, MAX?

20:36.443 --> 20:38.028
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THERE'S THAT PICTURE OF ME

20:38.111 --> 20:39.571
{\an1}DRIVING MY BEAT-UP OLD CAR.

{\an1}&gt;&gt; IT'S A SOLID GOLD

20:40.280 --> 20:40.906
{\an1}CONVERTIBLE.

{\an1}FROM A SINGLE DIAMOND.

20:43.075 --> 20:43.325
{\an1}I'M NOT SURE

20:43.408 --> 20:45.285
{\an1}OF THE POINT YOU'RE MAKING.

20:45.369 --> 20:45.953
{\an1}&gt;&gt; LOTS OF PEOPLE

20:46.036 --> 20:46.370
{\an1}DON'T EVEN OWN CARS.

20:46.453 --> 20:48.789
{\an1}LIKE ME, FOR EXAMPLE.

20:48.872 --> 20:49.998
{\an1}&gt;&gt; DON'T OWN A CAR?

20:50.082 --> 20:52.501
{\an1}WELL GOODNESS, TAKE MINE.

20:52.584 --> 20:53.418
{\an1}&gt;&gt; HOW WILL YOU GET TO WORK?

20:53.502 --> 20:54.419
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I'LL TAKE THE BUS.

{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH, IT SAYS HERE HE ALSO OWNS

20:56.171 --> 21:01.343
{\an1}A SOLID GOLD BUS.

21:01.426 --> 21:01.760

{\an1}&gt;&gt; PERHAPS.

21:18.443 --> 21:19.653
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I THOUGHT

21:19.736 --> 21:20.404
{\an1}YOU WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO USE THAT

21:20.487 --> 21:21.697
{\an1}IN THE OFFICE ANYMORE.

21:21.780 --> 21:22.239
{\an1}SOMEBODY COULD GET HURT.

21:22.322 --> 21:23.907
{\an1}&gt;&gt; SLINGSHOTS ARE

21:23.991 --> 21:24.574
{\an1}LIKE LIGHTNING.

21:24.658 --> 21:28.286
{\an1}NOBODY EVER GETS HURT TWICE.

21:28.370 --> 21:37.337
{\an1}&gt;&gt; HI GUYS, I'M BACK.

21:37.421 --> 21:38.088

21:38.171 --> 21:38.380
{\an1}ANOTHER ONE

21:38.463 --> 21:45.595

21:47.014 --> 21:48.181
{\an1}THE CLUMSIEST ACCOUNTANT

{\an1}IN TOWN.

21:48.557 --> 21:50.517
{\an1}[LAUGHS]

21:50.600 --> 21:51.852
{\an1}I'M JUST KIDDING.

21:51.935 --> 21:52.936
{\an1}HOW ARE YOU DOING?

21:53.020 --> 21:54.730
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WELL, I'M A BIT DROWSY

21:54.813 --> 21:56.815
{\an1}I WAS IN SURGERY, YOU KNOW.

21:56.898 --> 21:58.483
{\an1}&gt;&gt; ANYWAY, I FELT TERRIBLE,

21:58.567 --> 21:58.984
{\an1}SO I WANTED YOU TO HAVE

21:59.067 --> 22:00.569
{\an1}A COOKIE ANL SOME FLOWERS.

22:00.652 --> 22:01.987
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHERE ARE THEY?

22:02.070 --> 22:02.320
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I ATE THEM.

22:02.404 --> 22:04.364
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THE FLOWERS TOO?

22:04.448 --> 22:07.117
{\an1}&gt;&gt; IT WAS A LONG BUS RIDE.

22:07.200 --> 22:07.492
{\an1}OH, YOU'RE NEVER

22:07.576 --> 22:08.118
{\an1}GOING TO BELIEVE

22:08.201 --> 22:08.994
{\an1}WHAT HAPPENED AT WORK.

22:09.077 --> 22:09.870
{\an1}OUR SCIENCE TEACHER

22:09.953 --> 22:10.620
{\an1}INVENTED A SPRAY

22:10.704 --> 22:12.289
{\an1}THAT CAN WATERPROOF ANYTHING.

22:12.372 --> 22:12.914
{\an1}YOU WANT TO SEE?

22:12.998 --> 22:14.332
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NOT PARTICULARLY.

22:14.416 --> 22:15.500
{\an1}&gt;&gt; IT'S PRETTY AMAZING.

22:15.584 --> 22:16.084
{\an1}HOWEVER COOL

22:16.168 --> 22:17.002
{\an1}YOU THINK IT'S GONNA BE,

22:17.085 --> 22:18.879
{\an1}DOUBLE IT.

22:18.962 --> 22:19.796
{\an1}DID YOU DOUBLE IT?

22:19.880 --> 22:24.176
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YES.

22:24.259 --> 22:25.510
{\an1}AAH. IT SOAKED

22:25.594 --> 22:26.887
{\an1}RIGHT THROUGH.

22:26.970 --> 22:27.471
{\an1}&gt;&gt; IT'S IMP█SSIBLE.

22:27.554 --> 22:33.101
{\an1}I SPRAYED IT WITH AIR FRESHENER.

22:33.185 --> 22:33.894
{\an1}WELL, I SHOULD PROBABLY

22:33.977 --> 22:34.519

22:34.603 --> 22:35.145
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YES,

22:35.228 --> 22:37.355
{\an1}I THINK THAT WOULD BE BEST.

22:37.439 --> 22:39.357
{\an1}&gt;&gt; ON SECOND THOUGHT,

22:39.441 --> 22:40.859
{\an1}I THINK I'LL HANG OUT

22:40.942 --> 22:41.818
{\an1}HERE TODAY.
