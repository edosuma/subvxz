WEBVTT

00:28.071 --> 00:30.073
Eamon.

00:35.296 --> 00:38.342
This is Detective Baez.
I'm off duty.

00:38.386 --> 00:41.998
I have a male DOA
in front of my residence.

00:51.225 --> 00:52.617
You summoned?

00:52.661 --> 00:54.271
Shut the door.

00:55.229 --> 00:56.404
Please.

00:58.014 --> 00:59.363
You need to do something.

00:59.407 --> 01:01.278
Okay. What?

01:01.322 --> 01:03.541
I don't know.
Restrain me, maybe.

01:04.499 --> 01:05.978
Here?

01:06.022 --> 01:07.980
-Not literally, Anthony.
-It was a joke.

01:08.024 --> 01:09.504
Remember jokes?

01:10.983 --> 01:12.115
What's this?

01:12.159 --> 01:13.377
Read it.

01:15.118 --> 01:17.077
I forgot my glasses.

01:17.120 --> 01:18.948
They're notes.

01:18.991 --> 01:20.515
She's giving me notes.

01:20.558 --> 01:21.516
Who?

01:23.257 --> 01:25.476
The Right Honorable
Kimberly Crawford,

01:25.520 --> 01:28.088
the District Attorney
for New York County.

01:28.131 --> 01:30.351
Well, you give me notes all the
time when we're working a case.

01:30.394 --> 01:31.874
That's different.

01:31.917 --> 01:33.528
Of course. My bad."When cross-examining

01:33.571 --> 01:36.313
"the defense witness,
focus on his priors

01:36.357 --> 01:39.664
because they bear directly
on his credibility."

01:39.708 --> 01:41.231
That's not so bad.

01:41.275 --> 01:43.494
Yeah! It's 101!

01:43.538 --> 01:45.017
Of course I'm gonna do that!

01:45.061 --> 01:46.367
Of course, right.

01:46.410 --> 01:48.325
And the rest of these? Hell no.

01:48.369 --> 01:50.022
All right, you're not
gonna believe this.

01:50.066 --> 01:52.242
All right, listen to this one.
"You..."I...

01:53.374 --> 01:54.505
What?

01:54.549 --> 01:57.117
How about if you
write her a note

01:57.160 --> 01:59.119
saying, "Thanks for the input,"

01:59.162 --> 02:00.511
uh, hand-deliver it, and then

02:00.555 --> 02:03.079
do whatever it is
you're gonna do anyway.

02:04.950 --> 02:06.996
That is a great idea.

02:09.607 --> 02:12.567
There you go. It's not so bad.

02:14.395 --> 02:15.918
Uh-huh.

02:19.487 --> 02:21.315
That is not what I said.

02:21.358 --> 02:23.926
No, but I like
the "hand-deliver" part.

02:29.714 --> 02:33.283
I understand, and
I'm not unsympathetic.

02:33.327 --> 02:34.415
You disagree?

02:34.458 --> 02:35.546
No, Sarge.

02:35.590 --> 02:36.939
It's the third time.

02:36.982 --> 02:38.549
You think that's
acceptable?

02:38.593 --> 02:40.290
I think it's not
under my control.

02:40.334 --> 02:42.249
Showing up to work on time
is not under your control?

02:42.292 --> 02:44.555
Not when my wife gets sick,
causing me to be late for work.

02:44.599 --> 02:46.688
I mean, that...
that's not under my control.

02:46.731 --> 02:47.950
It's the third time.

02:47.993 --> 02:49.560
-Yes, Sarge.
-In a week.

02:49.604 --> 02:51.562
Yes, Sarge.

02:51.606 --> 02:53.521
All right, that's it?
Nothing else to say?

02:54.565 --> 02:56.611
I'm sorry?

02:57.699 --> 02:59.353
You just lost your seat
in the car.

02:59.396 --> 03:00.963
You're on a foot post
for a week.

03:01.006 --> 03:02.486
Sarge, come on, it's 20 de...

03:03.748 --> 03:05.968
Yes, Sergeant.

03:12.627 --> 03:14.629
-Today's roll.
-Thank you.

03:17.066 --> 03:19.721
You were a little tough on Diaz
there, don't you think?

03:19.764 --> 03:22.158
If I thought that,
I wouldn't have

03:22.202 --> 03:24.116
did what I did...

03:24.160 --> 03:25.509
would I?

03:25.553 --> 03:27.119
No.

03:27.163 --> 03:29.557
But his wife is pregnant.

03:29.600 --> 03:32.081
She gets sick in the morning.
He's just helping out.

03:32.124 --> 03:35.302
The first time, the second time,
the third time, even, I get it.

03:35.345 --> 03:37.434
But after that,
you develop a backup plan.

03:39.044 --> 03:40.524
Anything else?

03:41.569 --> 03:43.484
No, Sergeant.

03:51.492 --> 03:54.146
You have thoughts on this?

03:54.190 --> 03:56.323
I mean, I get it.

03:56.366 --> 03:59.804
He doesn't seem
100% himself lately.

03:59.848 --> 04:02.459
Less than 50%, where I sit.

04:02.503 --> 04:04.156
Garrett?

04:06.507 --> 04:09.553
I'd be lying if I said
I didn't notice a change.

04:10.598 --> 04:14.036
And what would you be if you
were simply telling the truth?

04:16.081 --> 04:18.258
He's not telling us
anything, but...

04:18.301 --> 04:20.695
you can't help but
see the writing on the wall.

04:21.696 --> 04:23.785
Maybe he and Sheila
are having problems.

04:23.828 --> 04:26.657
And, like with almost everyone,

04:26.701 --> 04:30.182
there's probably
increased drinking.

04:30.226 --> 04:32.402
Or it's all of the above,

04:32.446 --> 04:35.318
with a few unknowns thrown in.

04:35.362 --> 04:36.493
Look...

04:37.799 --> 04:40.323
...it's bad
and it's getting worse.

04:43.195 --> 04:44.632
Sorry I'm late, boss.

04:44.675 --> 04:47.156
Abigail, Garrett.

04:55.425 --> 04:57.122
Let me get this
for you.

05:01.562 --> 05:04.304
Sorry, boss. It's been, uh...

05:04.347 --> 05:05.609
been a crazy morning.

05:05.653 --> 05:07.698
How?

05:07.742 --> 05:09.744
Just, you know...

05:09.787 --> 05:11.528
Monday.

05:11.572 --> 05:14.749
Gee, I never heard
a day of the week

05:14.792 --> 05:17.708
used as an alibi before.

05:17.752 --> 05:19.710
It's more like
a figure of speech.

05:19.754 --> 05:21.756
What's going on, Sid?

05:24.759 --> 05:27.849
It's... just been
a couple of weeks of Mondays.

05:27.892 --> 05:29.764
Yeah, we already
did the Monday thing.

05:32.506 --> 05:36.161
Just a rough patch.
Nothing I can't handle.

05:41.297 --> 05:43.517
Well...

05:43.560 --> 05:45.562
I think you need a hand.

05:46.607 --> 05:48.173
I said I could handle it.

05:48.217 --> 05:50.132
Someone to kind of...

05:50.175 --> 05:52.569
steady the ladder, so to speak.

05:52.613 --> 05:53.744
You lost me there.

05:53.788 --> 05:56.312
Well, when my son Danny

05:56.356 --> 05:58.575
was going through a rough patch,
he got some help.

05:58.619 --> 06:01.578
-Nothing I can't handle.
-A Dr. Dawson.

06:01.622 --> 06:04.364
He has experience
working with cops.

06:05.408 --> 06:06.453
Like a shrink?

06:06.496 --> 06:08.803
Not like one. Is one.

06:13.764 --> 06:16.419
I don't know, boss.

06:16.463 --> 06:18.421
I'm more the strong,
silent type.

06:18.465 --> 06:21.293
Yeah, we'd all like
to think of ourselves that way,

06:21.337 --> 06:23.426
but this last year has...

06:23.470 --> 06:25.472
kind of put a lie to that.

06:27.387 --> 06:30.346
And don't worry,
you're not alone in this.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.392
Garrett and Baker
will see him, too.

06:34.350 --> 06:37.614
We will?

06:37.658 --> 06:39.877
Yes.

06:39.921 --> 06:42.358
Strength in numbers.

06:46.449 --> 06:48.364
All for one and one for all?

06:50.671 --> 06:52.499
All for one?

06:57.460 --> 06:59.244
Sure.

06:59.288 --> 07:01.682
I'll even see him first.
How's that?

07:07.905 --> 07:09.385
He was lying there dead.

07:09.429 --> 07:11.300
I mean,
I really don't even know.

07:11.343 --> 07:12.562
Who was this guy?

07:12.606 --> 07:15.435
His name was Eamon.

07:15.478 --> 07:18.699
I met him at the gym.
He was my trainer.

07:19.700 --> 07:21.266
Did you know him well?

07:21.310 --> 07:23.747
I mean,
as well as you can know someone

07:23.791 --> 07:25.532
after going on a few dates
with them.

07:25.575 --> 07:28.317
Uh, and did you check him out?

07:28.360 --> 07:30.580
Yeah, of course. No record.

07:30.624 --> 07:32.843
No priors.
No enemies that I know of.

07:32.887 --> 07:35.237
Okay, what about family?

07:35.280 --> 07:36.499
Did he have kids?

07:36.543 --> 07:38.458
Ex-wife? Married?

07:38.501 --> 07:40.460
I wouldn't go out
with a married guy.

07:40.503 --> 07:41.852
Yeah, but that doesn't mean
that a married guy

07:41.896 --> 07:43.288
wouldn't go out with you.

07:45.290 --> 07:47.379
As far as I know, no.

07:47.423 --> 07:49.338
But I didn't do
a lot of digging.

07:49.381 --> 07:51.253
I mean, I didn't have feelings
for the guy,

07:51.296 --> 07:52.820
at least not yet.

07:52.863 --> 07:54.909
Okay. Some old girlfriends
that you know of?

07:54.952 --> 07:57.259
Look, I really have no idea.

07:57.302 --> 07:59.000
Probably. I didn't ask.

07:59.043 --> 08:02.569
I mean, we only went
on a couple of dates.

08:02.612 --> 08:04.875
He said he was single.
I didn't sweat him.

08:04.919 --> 08:08.923
Okay. Any idea
who might want him dead?

08:41.433 --> 08:43.435
You wanted to see me, boss?

08:43.479 --> 08:45.568
Yeah. Come in, take a seat.

08:45.612 --> 08:47.570
Well, it's always bad news
when you tell me to sit down.

08:47.614 --> 08:48.658
Do you mind if I stand, please?

08:48.702 --> 08:50.747
Sit down.

08:54.969 --> 08:57.580
I already know
what you're gonna say.

08:57.624 --> 08:59.539
-Oh, you do?
-Yeah.

08:59.582 --> 09:01.758
Internal Affairs is gonna start
sniffing around my partner.

09:01.802 --> 09:03.804
-Already on their way.
-Okay, but, boss,

09:03.847 --> 09:05.762
you and I both know
she had nothing to do with this.

09:05.806 --> 09:07.503
That's us. That's not them.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.461
So, I can't even talk
to my own partner anymore?

09:09.505 --> 09:10.941
Incorrect.

09:10.985 --> 09:15.424
Oh, you want me to put her
in the box and sweat her.

09:15.467 --> 09:17.382
I just want you to give her
a friendly dry run

09:17.426 --> 09:18.949
before the rat squad shows up.

09:18.993 --> 09:20.908
She's not gonna like that.
I don't want to do it.

09:20.951 --> 09:22.562
It's what's best for her.

09:26.087 --> 09:28.568
All right.

09:31.658 --> 09:33.703
15 years.

09:34.835 --> 09:36.097
15. That's how long

09:36.140 --> 09:37.620
I've been in this office,
doing this job.

09:37.664 --> 09:39.796
How long you been here?
Couple months?

09:39.840 --> 09:41.929
So, if you want to talk
about my case

09:41.972 --> 09:44.105
or discuss strategy
or get briefed

09:44.148 --> 09:47.151
on what I plan on doing,
then let's do that.

09:47.195 --> 09:48.631
Let's have that discussion.

09:48.675 --> 09:50.067
But to give me notes

09:50.111 --> 09:53.114
like I'm some
wet-behind-the-ears A.D.A.?

09:53.157 --> 09:56.378
No. Let's not do that.

09:57.118 --> 09:58.641
I'm sorry, Cyrus.

09:58.685 --> 10:00.512
I'm gonna have to give you
a call back.

10:02.514 --> 10:04.516
Yeah. No problem.

10:05.692 --> 10:07.519
You were on the phone?

10:09.870 --> 10:11.480
Yep.

10:11.523 --> 10:12.655
Why didn't you say anything?

10:12.699 --> 10:14.004
Why didn't you knock?

10:14.048 --> 10:15.179
I apologize.

10:15.223 --> 10:17.529
That was unprofessional.

10:17.573 --> 10:18.835
You think?

10:18.879 --> 10:20.968
Was that any Cyrus I might know?

10:21.011 --> 10:22.839
Governor's new deputy.

10:22.883 --> 10:24.841
And you know what
he's doing right now?

10:24.885 --> 10:27.627
Reconsidering his opinion of me.

10:27.670 --> 10:29.498
After all, if my own staff

10:29.541 --> 10:33.197
does not respect me,
my boundaries or my notes,

10:33.241 --> 10:34.851
why should he?

10:34.895 --> 10:37.158
Again, I apologize.

10:37.201 --> 10:38.725
Unprofessional.

10:38.768 --> 10:39.987
Unacceptable.

10:40.030 --> 10:42.076
Yes. That, too.

10:45.514 --> 10:48.430
But the thing
with the-the notes,

10:48.473 --> 10:50.040
that...

10:50.084 --> 10:51.912
that still stands.

10:51.955 --> 10:53.087
Does it?

10:54.175 --> 10:55.916
Yes.

10:57.918 --> 10:59.702
Great.

10:59.746 --> 11:04.489
Then let's you and I sit down
for that conversation...

11:04.533 --> 11:06.448
tomorrow.

11:23.204 --> 11:25.946
Dr. Dawson is here.

11:27.121 --> 11:29.166
Oh.

11:30.646 --> 11:31.821
Okay.

11:37.653 --> 11:39.916
Commissioner Reagan,
Dr. Alex Dawson.

11:39.960 --> 11:41.918
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

11:41.962 --> 11:43.180
Please.

11:45.530 --> 11:49.186
I hope you don't mind us doing
it here instead of your office.

11:49.230 --> 11:51.885
My schedule's packed
to the gills.

11:51.928 --> 11:53.756
Of course, Commissioner.

11:53.800 --> 11:56.193
Sit down, please.

11:56.237 --> 11:59.022
Unless I'm supposed
to take the couch.

11:59.066 --> 12:02.156
No, this... this is fine.

12:04.245 --> 12:06.682
Thanks for helping me out.

12:07.683 --> 12:09.293
Not at all.

12:09.337 --> 12:11.513
I was pleasantly surprised
when you reached out with it.

12:11.556 --> 12:12.775
Coffee?

12:12.819 --> 12:14.124
I'm good, thanks.

12:14.168 --> 12:16.779
So...

12:16.823 --> 12:19.826
can I let you in on
a little secret?

12:19.869 --> 12:23.003
If you let me take a guess
at what it is first.

12:24.004 --> 12:25.614
Okay.

12:26.658 --> 12:28.922
That you don't need
any help personally.

12:28.965 --> 12:30.924
You're sitting with me
as a generous gesture

12:30.967 --> 12:33.143
to remove the stigma
for the old-school cop

12:33.187 --> 12:36.930
who you think does need therapy
but is allergic to the idea.

12:36.973 --> 12:40.107
Well...

12:40.150 --> 12:43.850
I wouldn't characterize it
just like that.

12:44.851 --> 12:47.767
And how would you
characterize it?

12:48.724 --> 12:50.770
It's complicated.

12:50.813 --> 12:52.859
If I have any questions,
I'll speak up.

12:52.902 --> 12:55.644
And maybe you don't need
that pen and pad.

12:58.255 --> 13:00.649
I'll put it away
if it bothers you.

13:00.692 --> 13:02.259
It doesn't bother me.

13:02.303 --> 13:04.000
But you just asked me
to put it away.

13:04.044 --> 13:06.046
Suggested.

13:09.876 --> 13:12.095
Am I doing this wrong?

13:12.139 --> 13:14.750
How do you think
you could be doing it wrong?

13:16.839 --> 13:18.798
I always told my kids

13:18.841 --> 13:21.104
not to answer a question
with a question.

13:26.022 --> 13:28.677
Can I be honest with you?

13:28.720 --> 13:31.332
Have you been dishonest
with me so far?

13:33.290 --> 13:36.119
Look, there might have been
some truth to what you said

13:36.163 --> 13:39.122
about this being a gesture.

13:39.166 --> 13:41.864
But the point is,
my guy needs some help,

13:41.908 --> 13:45.302
and I think you're
the right person for the job.

13:45.346 --> 13:47.174
I'm just...

13:47.217 --> 13:51.134
kind of here to--
oh, I don't know--

13:51.178 --> 13:53.920
maybe kick-start the process.

13:53.963 --> 13:56.313
But <i>you</i> don't need any help?

14:06.933 --> 14:10.023
I can tell you from experience
that time doesn't speed up

14:10.066 --> 14:12.112
the more you check the clock.

14:15.376 --> 14:17.421
And even the happiest person
who walks the earth

14:17.465 --> 14:19.946
needs more than four minutes
to unload.

14:28.824 --> 14:30.739
Sorry.

14:32.828 --> 14:35.048
Like I said, packed day.

14:39.139 --> 14:42.969
Maybe we can think of this
as a prelim.

14:48.757 --> 14:50.846
Again, thanks so much.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.717
You take care.

15:00.987 --> 15:02.771
Got a minute?

15:03.728 --> 15:05.730
Hello?

15:10.300 --> 15:12.389
Oh, you're sleeping.

15:12.433 --> 15:14.087
I'm meditating.

15:14.130 --> 15:16.219
Oh, sorry.

15:16.263 --> 15:17.786
Are you done?

15:18.743 --> 15:20.397
I am now.

15:21.921 --> 15:24.445
How can I be of service,
Officer Janko?

15:27.361 --> 15:28.884
It's about Diaz.

15:28.928 --> 15:30.886
Didn't we already have
that conversation?

15:30.930 --> 15:34.455
We did, but...

15:34.498 --> 15:36.457
we have to have it again.

15:36.500 --> 15:38.372
It's never as good
as the first time.

15:38.415 --> 15:40.461
Cute.

15:40.504 --> 15:43.116
You need to reconsider
the rip you gave him.

15:43.159 --> 15:45.031
Do I?

15:45.074 --> 15:46.815
You do.

15:46.858 --> 15:48.860
And all this time,
I thought I was the one

15:48.904 --> 15:50.819
wearing the stripes
in the family.

15:52.473 --> 15:54.431
You remember that time
you thought I should

15:54.475 --> 15:56.999
withdraw my name
when the precinct was

15:57.043 --> 15:59.393
electing an alternate
for the new union delegate?

15:59.436 --> 16:01.525
Because of a conflict
of interest between us.

16:01.569 --> 16:04.267
And you were smart
to listen to me.

16:04.311 --> 16:06.356
Yeah.

16:06.400 --> 16:08.880
I didn't, and I was elected.

16:10.882 --> 16:12.754
And Diaz is my first assignment

16:12.797 --> 16:16.366
because our regular
union delegate is on vacation.

16:17.324 --> 16:19.021
Tell me you're kidding.

16:19.065 --> 16:23.460
Tell me that you will reconsider
the rip you gave Diaz.

16:26.028 --> 16:28.248
I can't. I won't.

16:31.903 --> 16:33.427
Well...

16:33.470 --> 16:35.168
What's that?

16:35.211 --> 16:37.474
It is formal notice
from the union.

16:37.518 --> 16:41.217
And you and I have
a preliminary hearing

16:41.261 --> 16:44.046
tomorrow with the C.O.

16:48.964 --> 16:51.184
I'll let you get back
to meditating.

16:58.582 --> 17:01.846
Detective Baez, you knew the
victim in question personally,

17:01.890 --> 17:03.065
Eamon Riordan?

17:03.109 --> 17:05.198
I did.

17:05.241 --> 17:08.244
How would you describe
the state of your relationship?

17:09.985 --> 17:11.421
Insignificant.

17:11.465 --> 17:12.901
How long were you dating?

17:12.944 --> 17:14.816
I just said we weren't dating.

17:14.859 --> 17:17.862
We went on about
three or four dates.

17:17.906 --> 17:19.212
Some people would
actually consider

17:19.255 --> 17:21.257
three or four dates
to be dating.

17:21.301 --> 17:23.390
Well, I wouldn't.

17:23.433 --> 17:24.478
Okay.

17:26.132 --> 17:27.176
Were you intimate?

17:29.004 --> 17:31.224
Seriously, Danny?

17:31.267 --> 17:34.836
You know I.A. is gonna
ask you that... and more.

17:40.015 --> 17:41.451
I barely knew the guy.

17:41.495 --> 17:44.063
Yet he ends up dead
on your doorstep, Detective.

17:47.327 --> 17:48.589
Were you two close?

17:48.632 --> 17:50.504
Come on, Danny,
what is this?

17:50.547 --> 17:52.941
Did you have feelings
-for each other?
-What is this?

17:52.984 --> 17:54.334
This is about one tenth
of what I.A.

17:54.377 --> 17:56.901
is going to be asking you,
and you know it.

17:56.945 --> 17:59.904
Well, I can't tell if you're
just playing I.A. with me,

17:59.948 --> 18:02.211
or if these are the questions
you just really want to ask.

18:02.255 --> 18:04.387
You think
I want to do this?

18:04.431 --> 18:06.346
'Cause, honestly, I can't tell
if you're not answering

18:06.389 --> 18:08.261
because it's me
asking the questions

18:08.304 --> 18:10.437
or if you just don't
have answers.

18:10.480 --> 18:12.613
And if that's the case,

18:12.656 --> 18:14.136
you really need to find them

18:14.180 --> 18:16.573
before I.A. comes rolling
through that door.

18:33.982 --> 18:35.592
There you are.
Thank you so much.

18:35.636 --> 18:38.160
-You come here a lot?
-I like it.

18:38.204 --> 18:40.336
Nice quiet atmosphere.

18:40.380 --> 18:42.077
So it's a great
place to come

18:42.121 --> 18:44.123
if you want to
keep things civil.

18:47.387 --> 18:50.172
That's one of my father's

18:50.216 --> 18:52.218
"Let's keep it civil."

18:52.261 --> 18:55.351
-As in keep it productive?
-Sometimes.

18:55.395 --> 18:58.006
And sometimes
to deflect conflict

18:58.049 --> 18:59.573
he doesn't want to have.

19:00.574 --> 19:02.184
Not me.

19:02.228 --> 19:04.143
Let's have our conversation.

19:05.535 --> 19:07.929
I wanted your job.

19:10.584 --> 19:12.063
Honest.

19:13.630 --> 19:15.371
Return the favor?

19:15.415 --> 19:17.678
You resent me because I'm Black.

19:17.721 --> 19:19.070
Uh, no.

19:19.114 --> 19:20.507
I'm not saying
you're racist

19:20.550 --> 19:23.423
by any stretch,
but you think I got this job--

19:23.466 --> 19:26.165
your job-- because I'm Black.

19:26.208 --> 19:27.514
No, I never said that.

19:27.557 --> 19:29.646
No, it's okay,
because it's true.

19:29.690 --> 19:32.083
And I'm okay with that
for lots of reasons.

19:32.127 --> 19:35.217
First and foremost because
it is far from the only reason

19:35.261 --> 19:37.176
that I got the job.

19:38.612 --> 19:41.310
I got the job
because I'm qualified.

19:41.354 --> 19:43.747
Agreed.
Great.

19:43.791 --> 19:46.533
Then we agree to agree.

19:46.576 --> 19:49.710
And so it's only fair
that I run it my way.

19:49.753 --> 19:52.191
Or the highway.

19:53.279 --> 19:54.628
I will continue to give you

19:54.671 --> 19:56.282
as many notes
as I see necessary.

19:58.588 --> 20:02.244
So make me miserable
until I quit.

20:02.288 --> 20:03.593
I'm not trying
to make you miserable,

20:03.637 --> 20:05.682
but I am running it my way.

20:05.726 --> 20:09.033
A distinction
without a difference.

20:09.077 --> 20:12.211
I control me. You control you.

20:20.480 --> 20:22.482
We need to talk.

20:22.525 --> 20:24.266
Look, about yesterday,

20:24.310 --> 20:26.181
I know you were just
doing the right thing.

20:26.225 --> 20:28.270
It's not about
yesterday.

20:28.314 --> 20:29.576
Come on.

20:29.619 --> 20:30.707
Where?

20:30.751 --> 20:32.796
Just come with
me, please.

20:32.840 --> 20:34.711
-What's going on?
-How's it going?

20:34.755 --> 20:36.409
What?

20:37.845 --> 20:39.716
I just made the pot fresh
myself this morning.

20:39.760 --> 20:41.501
-How is it?
-What are you talking about?

20:41.544 --> 20:43.198
Just come with me.

20:45.766 --> 20:47.463
Danny, what is going on?

20:47.507 --> 20:50.510
Don't look, but look.

20:50.553 --> 20:52.120
You see the blonde?

20:52.163 --> 20:54.078
-Yeah. Who is she?
-Do you know her?

20:54.122 --> 20:56.298
No. Should I?

20:56.342 --> 20:58.474
Well, she knows your guy friend.

20:58.518 --> 21:01.477
Okay, one of his clients?

21:01.521 --> 21:02.652
Who is she?

21:02.696 --> 21:04.698
His fiancée.

21:22.498 --> 21:24.631
What you doing?

21:24.674 --> 21:26.328
Nothing.

21:27.634 --> 21:29.766
You closed
your computer?

21:29.810 --> 21:32.116
I did.
Why?

21:32.160 --> 21:34.162
Why do you want to know?

21:34.205 --> 21:36.773
Because you obviously don't want
me to know what you're writing.

21:36.817 --> 21:39.341
Well, if it's so obvious,
then why do you want to see it?

21:39.385 --> 21:41.778
Because I'm curious.

21:41.822 --> 21:43.737
Curiosity is rarely considered
sound reason for taking action.

21:43.780 --> 21:44.868
Remember the cat?

21:44.912 --> 21:46.348
You're annoying, you know that?

21:46.392 --> 21:48.263
I've been told.

21:48.307 --> 21:49.830
You're writing what you're
gonna say to the C.O. tomorrow.

21:49.873 --> 21:52.398
Actually, I was writing you
a love letter.

21:53.399 --> 21:55.139
You're really pissing me off.

21:55.183 --> 21:56.706
Then I'm sorry,
and I'm just doing my job.

21:56.750 --> 21:58.229
It's not fair.

21:58.273 --> 21:59.709
You're a lawyer.

21:59.753 --> 22:01.842
You know how to make
a really good argument. I don't.

22:01.885 --> 22:04.148
And yet I've lost, like,
a million arguments with you.

22:04.192 --> 22:05.802
Trust me.

22:05.846 --> 22:07.848
You're gonna do just fine.

22:13.854 --> 22:15.334
That looks pretty bad.

22:16.378 --> 22:17.901
Not as bad as it feels.

22:17.945 --> 22:20.208
You sure you don't want
to take the day?

22:20.251 --> 22:21.470
Sheila's home.

22:21.514 --> 22:23.559
So you got a built-in
Florence Nightingale.

22:23.603 --> 22:25.300
More likely Nurse Ratched.

22:27.215 --> 22:29.913
Ladies, gentlemen.

22:29.957 --> 22:31.698
Frank.
Boss.

22:31.741 --> 22:32.612
We were just discussing
how challenging

22:32.655 --> 22:34.178
the past year has been

22:34.222 --> 22:35.310
for marriages all
across the country.

22:35.354 --> 22:36.485
Sheila break your hand?

22:36.529 --> 22:38.269
Sliced my thumb open

22:38.313 --> 22:40.271
cleaning my butcher's
knife in the sink.

22:40.315 --> 22:42.752
-How many stitches?
-Dozen.

22:42.796 --> 22:46.582
Plus, they had to
reattach a tendon.

22:46.626 --> 22:49.411
And you showed up for work?

22:49.455 --> 22:50.760
No rest for the weary.

22:50.804 --> 22:53.546
Are you weary or wounded?

22:55.635 --> 22:57.419
Look, you got a lot
on your plate, Sid.

22:57.463 --> 22:59.203
Why don't you take the day.

22:59.247 --> 23:01.597
Thank you, boss, but, honestly,
I'd rather stay here.

23:01.641 --> 23:03.207
Keep busy with work.

23:03.251 --> 23:05.775
I got a stack a mile high
sitting on my desk.

23:05.819 --> 23:07.864
And your gun hand's
out of service.

23:07.908 --> 23:09.388
You see Dawson yet?

23:12.478 --> 23:14.436
I'm trying to find the time.

23:14.480 --> 23:17.352
I found the time yesterday.
Piece of cake.

23:17.396 --> 23:20.224
Well, I had enough doctoring
in the ER for this week.

23:20.268 --> 23:22.749
I'm going later today.
We could ride down together.

23:22.792 --> 23:24.881
-I'm fine.
Maybe he could
squeeze me in, too.

23:24.925 --> 23:26.230
We'll make it a thing.

23:26.274 --> 23:28.624
A pity party.

23:28.668 --> 23:29.843
Maybe grab
a piece of cake after.

23:31.975 --> 23:33.847
Get it done.

23:46.468 --> 23:47.687
Morning.

23:47.730 --> 23:48.862
Morning, partner.

23:48.905 --> 23:50.211
I'm guessing you're here

23:50.254 --> 23:52.387
because you want
some information

23:52.431 --> 23:55.956
about the interview
with the fiancée, yes?

23:55.999 --> 23:58.393
Come to think of it,
a heads-up would've been nice.

23:59.394 --> 24:01.004
Well, fair enough.

24:01.048 --> 24:02.832
It's also fair
that I tell you

24:02.876 --> 24:06.096
that her alibi is
rock-solid so far.

24:06.140 --> 24:08.708
Okay.

24:08.751 --> 24:10.927
I would've called you,
or I would've texted you,

24:10.971 --> 24:12.276
but I can't.

24:12.320 --> 24:14.061
If I did, it's gonna ping
on I.A.'s radar.

24:14.104 --> 24:16.019
Then we're gonna have
a serious problem.

24:16.063 --> 24:19.762
No. Danny, it's fine.
That-That's not why I'm here.

24:19.806 --> 24:21.851
Okay, why are you here?

24:21.895 --> 24:24.941
I got a package
this morning.

24:24.985 --> 24:26.769
Related to the case?

24:26.813 --> 24:29.903
No. It's, uh, laundry detergent
from Amazon.

24:29.946 --> 24:31.513
And you rushed right over
to tell me about that?

24:31.557 --> 24:33.080
Let me finish.

24:33.123 --> 24:35.735
Look, when the delivery guy
rang my doorbell,

24:35.778 --> 24:38.259
my phone rang
at the same exact time.

24:39.260 --> 24:40.827
Is this a riddle?

24:42.089 --> 24:44.352
My doorbell is synched
to my phone.

24:44.395 --> 24:46.789
My contractor installed

24:46.833 --> 24:48.487
one of those video doorbell
things last week.

24:48.530 --> 24:50.750
I forgot all about it.

24:53.404 --> 24:55.145
Did you say "video"?

24:55.189 --> 24:56.495
Every one of these is

24:56.538 --> 24:58.235
an event that the
doorbell recorded.

24:58.279 --> 25:00.934
You just click on one,
-and it plays.
-Uh-huh.

25:04.851 --> 25:07.375
That's Patrick, my mailman.

25:10.291 --> 25:11.248
Here we go.

25:11.292 --> 25:12.423
You want to

25:12.467 --> 25:14.861
turn the other way or something?

25:14.904 --> 25:16.863
No, it's fine.

25:16.906 --> 25:19.039
Just hit "play."

25:19.996 --> 25:21.781
Okay.

25:35.621 --> 25:37.971
We got to get this to TARU.

25:48.895 --> 25:51.288
Morning, Sid.

25:51.332 --> 25:52.855
Morning, boss.

25:52.899 --> 25:55.118
I was just leaving you a note.

25:55.162 --> 25:57.164
Apologizing?

25:58.426 --> 26:00.297
About what?

26:00.341 --> 26:01.429
Come on.

26:01.472 --> 26:02.952
Look, we're all seeing Dawson.

26:02.996 --> 26:04.563
-That was the deal.
-Not that.

26:04.606 --> 26:06.477
For having me tailed.

26:06.521 --> 26:08.567
I'm sorry it was such
a big waste of time.

26:08.610 --> 26:10.481
What are you talking about?

26:10.525 --> 26:12.875
Having me pulled over on my way
home from the bar last night?

26:12.919 --> 26:15.312
-Give me a break.
-What the hell
are you talking about?

26:15.356 --> 26:17.314
And they played it real cute,
those two in the radio car.

26:17.358 --> 26:18.489
Boy, you should give 'em a medal

26:18.533 --> 26:19.882
for acting clueless.

26:19.926 --> 26:21.623
Sid ...d a Virgin Mary.

26:21.667 --> 26:23.494
All right?
A burger and a Virgin Mary!

26:23.538 --> 26:24.626
You really think

26:24.670 --> 26:25.975
I would drink and drive?!

26:26.019 --> 26:27.237
Sid!

26:32.939 --> 26:34.897
I had nothing to do
with that stop.

26:34.941 --> 26:36.116
Look at me!

26:39.902 --> 26:41.382
Nothing.

26:45.081 --> 26:46.605
You can't blame me
for thinking.

26:46.648 --> 26:49.346
-The hell I can't.
-Yeah, well,
what do you expect?

26:49.390 --> 26:51.914
You've been riding me
all week, busting my chops,

26:51.958 --> 26:55.178
giving me side eye about my
hand, like I did it on purpose.

26:55.222 --> 26:57.398
Making me go to the shrink when
you know I don't want to go.

26:57.441 --> 26:59.618
And you haven't gone.

26:59.661 --> 27:02.621
'Cause I got rights
to privacy like anybody else!

27:02.664 --> 27:05.188
Look, it's like
when you were a kid,

27:05.232 --> 27:08.365
driving with your mom and dad;
if they came to a sudden stop,

27:08.409 --> 27:12.195
they'd put their hands out and
brace you back into your seat.

27:12.239 --> 27:14.197
To keep you safe.

27:15.590 --> 27:19.376
That's all this is. Take it.

27:19.420 --> 27:22.553
Whether I like it or not, right?
Want it or not?

27:22.597 --> 27:25.513
Whether you recognize it or not.

27:25.556 --> 27:28.385
Even you? Huh?
The unsinkable Frank Reagan?

27:28.429 --> 27:29.996
Are you gonna tell me

27:30.039 --> 27:31.693
you're gonna be running back
to session number two?

27:31.737 --> 27:33.216
No.

27:33.260 --> 27:35.392
Right. Because you don't
need help, right?

27:35.436 --> 27:36.698
Just me.

27:36.742 --> 27:38.657
I'm the basket case...

27:40.267 --> 27:42.138
...who needs help.

27:50.146 --> 27:53.062
Take the day.
That's coming from a friend.

27:56.500 --> 27:58.328
His wife is having a baby.

27:58.372 --> 28:00.461
That's true, boss.
His <i>wife</i> is having a baby.

28:00.504 --> 28:02.028
That's the same as
he's having a baby.

28:02.071 --> 28:03.464
I'm not sure his wife would
agree with that.

28:03.507 --> 28:05.422
Don't try to
play for laughs.

28:05.466 --> 28:07.120
I'm not trying to ...ptain, the truth is

28:07.163 --> 28:09.426
Diaz should be applauded
for his behavior.

28:09.470 --> 28:10.732
Applauded for showing
up late to work

28:10.776 --> 28:12.952
-three times in a week?
-His wife is sick.

28:12.995 --> 28:14.997
-She's throwing up every morning.
-I understand that.

28:15.041 --> 28:16.607
Really? I don't think
Sergeant Reagan does.

28:16.651 --> 28:18.697
I think Sergeant Reagan
is the kind of man

28:18.740 --> 28:20.960
who would leave his wife
to fend for herself

28:21.003 --> 28:22.352
while off to work he goes.

28:23.614 --> 28:25.442
This isn't about
Sergeant Reagan.

28:25.486 --> 28:27.488
Sergeant Reagan is the one
who gave him the rip.

28:27.531 --> 28:29.055
Yes, after I excused

28:29.098 --> 28:30.752
his tardiness
on two separate occasions.

28:30.796 --> 28:32.623
But his wife is
still pregnant.

28:32.667 --> 28:34.451
What do you
expect him to do?

28:34.495 --> 28:36.279
Just magically wish away
her morning sickness?

28:36.323 --> 28:37.585
I expect him to
make a better plan,

28:37.628 --> 28:39.587
to wake up an hour earlier,

28:39.630 --> 28:41.023
to do things
the night before

28:41.067 --> 28:42.546
that he would typically
do in the morning

28:42.590 --> 28:45.071
so that he can help his wife
and get to work on time.

28:49.553 --> 28:51.512
Anything further?

28:51.555 --> 28:53.514
I-I just think...

28:54.776 --> 28:56.778
She's not feeling well, and...

28:56.822 --> 28:58.693
It's just that
Diaz is a good guy,

28:58.737 --> 29:01.000
and he's just trying
to do the right thing.

29:07.789 --> 29:09.486
Sergeant Reagan is right.

29:09.530 --> 29:11.401
Diaz has been
shown leniency.

29:13.099 --> 29:14.753
We keep making exceptions
to the rules around here,

29:14.796 --> 29:16.276
they become the rules.

29:17.407 --> 29:18.626
That'll be all.

29:18.669 --> 29:20.541
Thank you, boss.

29:27.417 --> 29:29.202
You rang, Your Majesty?

29:29.245 --> 29:31.334
Take a look at this for me.

29:31.378 --> 29:34.511
This is like déjà vu
all over again in here.

29:34.555 --> 29:36.731
Just read it.

29:43.259 --> 29:44.652
Are you out of your mind?

29:44.695 --> 29:46.132
That bad?

29:46.175 --> 29:48.090
I didn't get past
the first line.

29:48.134 --> 29:50.701
-Then what?
-You are not doing this.

29:50.745 --> 29:52.181
I won't let you.

29:52.225 --> 29:54.183
I'm not doing this.
She's doing this.

29:54.227 --> 29:55.706
What, she fired you?

29:56.751 --> 29:58.448
Not in so many words.

29:58.492 --> 30:00.189
Well, this is easy to decipher.

30:00.233 --> 30:01.800
Did she say
the words

30:01.843 --> 30:03.366
"You're fired"?

30:03.410 --> 30:05.238
No.

30:05.281 --> 30:07.806
Then you're not fired.
That'll be 50 bucks.

30:07.849 --> 30:10.417
She's pushing me out, Anthony.

30:10.460 --> 30:11.766
So push back.

30:13.333 --> 30:14.290
And why not?

30:14.334 --> 30:15.857
Because I'll lose.

30:15.901 --> 30:17.598
You don't know that.

30:17.641 --> 30:19.861
She's the boss,
and she thinks I resent her.

30:19.905 --> 30:21.384
You do resent her.

30:21.428 --> 30:23.169
Why does everyone
keep saying that?

30:23.212 --> 30:24.735
Because it's true.

30:24.779 --> 30:28.087
Of course you resent her.
She got the job that you wanted.

30:30.350 --> 30:33.396
Well, then, if she's right,
then I should go.

30:33.440 --> 30:35.877
I should leave
and start somewhere fresh.

30:35.921 --> 30:37.705
No, you should stand
your ground and push back.

30:37.748 --> 30:40.273
And, what, butt heads
the entire time?

30:40.316 --> 30:42.623
Suddenly you're bashful
about banging heads?

30:43.537 --> 30:45.626
Grow a pair and get to work.

32:17.544 --> 32:19.241
Police! Drop it!

32:19.285 --> 32:20.808
Right now!

32:44.919 --> 32:46.965
Thank you for coming.

32:47.008 --> 32:48.879
To your office.

32:48.923 --> 32:51.360
Yes, I appreciate it.

32:56.757 --> 32:58.759
After our lunch,

32:58.802 --> 33:01.414
I thought long and hard
about what you said.

33:01.457 --> 33:03.459
-I'm glad to hear that.
-And then I reread

33:03.503 --> 33:05.287
your notes on my case,

33:05.331 --> 33:07.289
and I have to admit there's some
very good guidance in there.

33:07.333 --> 33:08.987
More good news.

33:09.030 --> 33:10.945
And then I deleted your notes.

33:10.989 --> 33:13.426
While they were
very good suggestions

33:13.469 --> 33:16.646
and I have no doubt that you
would execute them flawlessly,

33:16.690 --> 33:19.258
they do not work for me.

33:19.301 --> 33:20.911
And you know this how?

33:20.955 --> 33:22.870
Because I know myself.

33:22.913 --> 33:24.741
Or as you put it,

33:24.785 --> 33:26.787
I control me.

33:27.788 --> 33:30.312
-And if I insist?
-Then I will

33:30.356 --> 33:33.011
try to find the time
to walk you through the progress

33:33.054 --> 33:36.318
of the 342 cases I'm overseeing.

33:36.362 --> 33:39.017
-Try to find the time?
-After putting out

33:39.060 --> 33:41.932
a few feelers,
I've gotten three job offers.

33:41.976 --> 33:43.630
So I would
have to clear

33:43.673 --> 33:46.328
that transition period
with the firm I go to.

33:46.372 --> 33:48.461
You would never leave this job.

33:48.504 --> 33:50.419
You haven't seen the offers.

33:52.117 --> 33:54.336
I can work with you.

33:54.380 --> 33:56.817
I cannot work for you.

33:59.950 --> 34:01.691
Let's keep it civil.

34:02.736 --> 34:04.825
Agreed.

34:17.881 --> 34:19.970
Been texting all morning.
Nothing.

34:20.014 --> 34:21.407
Yeah, me either.

34:21.450 --> 34:22.799
We got to get ahead
of this with Frank.

34:22.843 --> 34:24.584
You should say
something.

34:24.627 --> 34:25.846
Me? Why me?

34:25.889 --> 34:27.065
He likes you better.

34:27.108 --> 34:28.631
No, he doesn't.

34:28.675 --> 34:30.633
Besides, you outrank me
by, like, a million.

34:30.677 --> 34:32.070
-Morning.
-Morning.

34:32.113 --> 34:33.636
Morning.

34:34.942 --> 34:37.510
Sid said he's running
a little late, right?

34:37.553 --> 34:38.815
Shouldn't be too long.

34:38.859 --> 34:40.643
How long?

34:40.687 --> 34:42.384
Oh, I don't really know.

34:42.428 --> 34:43.603
He spoke to Abigail.

34:45.866 --> 34:46.910
Baker?

34:46.954 --> 34:48.695
He was kind of vague.

34:49.696 --> 34:51.132
But he will be coming in today?

34:51.176 --> 34:52.525
No question.

34:52.568 --> 34:53.874
Definitely.

34:57.486 --> 34:59.445
You're good people,
you know that?

34:59.488 --> 35:00.924
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

35:01.925 --> 35:03.579
You know why?

35:05.015 --> 35:09.629
You both understand the value
of being a good friend.

35:15.156 --> 35:18.028
Look, Sid is going to be fine.

35:18.072 --> 35:20.770
But he isn't gonna be in
for a while.

35:23.208 --> 35:24.905
What happened?

35:24.948 --> 35:27.777
Well...

35:27.821 --> 35:31.477
he found out
a couple of weeks ago that...

35:31.520 --> 35:35.437
his partner of 15 years
had died.

35:38.745 --> 35:40.181
No bedside visit.

35:40.225 --> 35:42.575
No funeral.

35:42.618 --> 35:44.881
No chance to say goodbye.

35:46.927 --> 35:49.930
I can't think of anything worse.

35:58.765 --> 36:00.070
"Even in our sleep,

36:00.114 --> 36:03.726
"pain which cannot forget

36:03.770 --> 36:06.555
falls drop by drop
upon the heart."

36:22.615 --> 36:24.443
You assigned Diaz
to Sector David.

36:24.486 --> 36:25.792
Yes, I did.

36:25.835 --> 36:27.881
He's supposed to be
on foot patrol, remember?

36:27.924 --> 36:29.709
Well, maybe someone
up top made a change.

36:29.752 --> 36:31.928
I talked to the C.O.
He said it wasn't him.

36:31.972 --> 36:33.539
Maybe the X.O. then.

36:33.582 --> 36:35.062
Nope.

36:35.105 --> 36:38.108
Well, then I don't know who,
or why you care so much.

36:38.152 --> 36:39.632
It's the outcome
you wanted.

36:39.675 --> 36:42.112
So maybe just be happy
it went your way?

36:43.070 --> 36:44.245
It was you.

36:44.289 --> 36:45.899
You think I undid
my own rip,

36:45.942 --> 36:47.161
even after the C.O.
ruled in my favor?

36:47.205 --> 36:49.076
I do.

36:49.119 --> 36:51.078
Well, you're wrong.
That makes no sense.

36:51.121 --> 36:52.471
Sure it does.

36:52.514 --> 36:54.516
You think I did it for you?

36:54.560 --> 36:56.649
For us.

36:57.824 --> 36:59.782
Look, you need to know

36:59.826 --> 37:02.655
that I absolutely
in no way undid that rip.

37:02.698 --> 37:04.265
Not for you.

37:04.309 --> 37:06.224
Not for anyone.

37:08.791 --> 37:10.271
Really?

37:10.315 --> 37:12.534
Really.

37:17.147 --> 37:18.584
I knew it.

37:18.627 --> 37:20.107
I knew it.
I knew it.

37:20.150 --> 37:21.761
I knew it!

37:23.719 --> 37:25.765
Sorry.

37:35.992 --> 37:37.994
How you doing?

37:38.038 --> 37:39.605
All good.

37:39.648 --> 37:41.128
Just, uh...

37:41.171 --> 37:42.782
just a few scrapes and bruises.

37:42.825 --> 37:45.132
Yeah, sorry.

37:45.175 --> 37:48.918
Guess her alibi wasn't
as good as we thought.

37:51.181 --> 37:53.140
How did you know?

37:53.183 --> 37:55.011
Your doorbell app.

37:55.055 --> 37:56.622
Yeah.

37:57.623 --> 37:59.929
It was still active
on my computer.

37:59.973 --> 38:02.323
Started pinging,
and I saw her

38:02.367 --> 38:04.151
approaching your place.

38:04.194 --> 38:06.762
So I... headed over.

38:07.807 --> 38:09.852
So I was saved by the bell?

38:09.896 --> 38:13.291
Yeah, you were literally
saved by the bell.

38:14.335 --> 38:16.729
Look, I don't know why

38:16.772 --> 38:19.209
I didn't tell you
I was out there dating.

38:19.253 --> 38:20.950
Any time

38:20.994 --> 38:23.083
I thought to mention it,
I just felt...

38:23.126 --> 38:25.215
awkward.

38:25.259 --> 38:27.740
You don't have to explain.

38:27.783 --> 38:30.220
You should probably know that

38:30.264 --> 38:32.962
whatever awkwardness you felt,

38:33.006 --> 38:35.182
I... I feel it, too.

38:37.402 --> 38:40.579
Well, maybe that can
just be enough for now?

38:43.364 --> 38:45.671
Yeah, I think so.

38:59.293 --> 39:01.077
It's thick.

39:01.121 --> 39:02.383
Mm.

39:02.427 --> 39:03.906
Wow.

39:03.950 --> 39:05.734
It's kind of thick.

39:06.866 --> 39:08.128
Could be thicker.

39:08.171 --> 39:10.348
What the hell are
you talking about?

39:10.391 --> 39:12.785
That is my first-choice
college acceptance letter.

39:12.828 --> 39:14.917
Or rejection letter.

39:14.961 --> 39:15.962
Well, gee,

39:16.005 --> 39:17.398
thanks for the support, Dad.

39:17.442 --> 39:19.792
I got to keep
his expectations realistic.

39:19.835 --> 39:22.011
Don't I?
Okay.

39:22.055 --> 39:24.797
Would somebody please tell me
what you're talking about?

39:24.840 --> 39:28.104
That's the letter
from his first-choice college.

39:28.148 --> 39:29.671
If it's thick,
it means he got in.

39:29.715 --> 39:31.934
Because?

39:31.978 --> 39:33.371
Oh, because of all the paperwork
he'll have to fill out.

39:33.414 --> 39:34.981
Oh.

39:35.024 --> 39:36.722
If the envelope is thin,
then it means it's just

39:36.765 --> 39:38.419
a letter saying
thanks but no thanks.

39:38.463 --> 39:40.029
That's cold, Uncle Jamie.

39:40.073 --> 39:41.379
Yeah, well,
the jury's out on this one,

39:41.422 --> 39:42.684
because it's...

39:42.728 --> 39:44.773
kind of both--
it's thick and thin.

39:44.817 --> 39:46.949
It's right in the middle.

39:46.993 --> 39:48.342
Well, I know one way
to find out.

39:48.386 --> 39:49.778
Open it.

39:49.822 --> 39:51.127
Yeah.
Yeah.

39:51.171 --> 39:52.868
Yeah, it's not gonna
open itself, Sean.

39:53.913 --> 39:56.132
Time to cowboy up.

39:56.176 --> 39:57.830
Fingers crossed.

40:00.180 --> 40:01.921
Good luck.

40:15.891 --> 40:17.110
I got in.

40:18.328 --> 40:19.373
I got in, Dad.

40:20.766 --> 40:22.202
Whoa!

40:22.245 --> 40:23.812
I got in, guys.

40:27.512 --> 40:28.991
Yeah!

40:30.776 --> 40:32.168
Yeah!

40:32.212 --> 40:33.169
Yes!

40:33.213 --> 40:34.693
Yay! Sean!

40:34.736 --> 40:36.390
Sean!

40:36.434 --> 40:38.348
-Way to go!
-Sean! Sean! Sean! Sean!

40:56.802 --> 40:58.325
Please, come in.

41:01.981 --> 41:03.896
Have a seat.

41:03.939 --> 41:06.420
I take it this visit's
not a gesture?

41:08.422 --> 41:10.946
No, it's not.

41:10.990 --> 41:13.253
And I take it
Lieutenant Gormley

41:13.296 --> 41:15.124
has not reached out
to you?

41:15.168 --> 41:16.517
No.

41:16.561 --> 41:18.214
Not surprised.

41:18.258 --> 41:19.999
You can lead a horse to water.

41:23.393 --> 41:25.178
Yes.

41:29.574 --> 41:31.271
Is that why
you asked me up here?

41:31.314 --> 41:33.795
I don't know why
I asked you up here.

41:34.970 --> 41:36.755
But thanks for coming.

41:39.453 --> 41:42.282
I hope you don't mind the desk.

41:42.325 --> 41:45.024
But... not the couch, please.

41:45.981 --> 41:48.767
Never been a fan of couches.

41:53.859 --> 41:55.295
Look.

41:57.950 --> 42:00.126
I don't want to waste your time.

42:02.563 --> 42:04.478
You're not.

42:10.310 --> 42:12.442
So...

42:12.486 --> 42:15.228
I lost my wife to cancer.

42:15.271 --> 42:18.927
My son and daughter-in-law
to murder.

42:18.971 --> 42:24.237
I've lost 23 of my people
in the line of duty.

42:24.280 --> 42:26.282
I have a grandson in harm's way

42:26.326 --> 42:28.981
and probably had a hand
in putting him there.

42:32.201 --> 42:34.203
And some days I can't see
past that scoreboard.
