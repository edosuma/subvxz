00:12.400 --> 00:16.720
I'm Fred Sirieix.
I've worked in the restaurant
industry for 25 years.

00:16.760 --> 00:20.800
Right now, the UK's
restaurant scene is
the envy of the world.

00:20.840 --> 00:25.520
And all it takes is
one great idea to make
a fortune on the high street.

00:27.680 --> 00:30.680
But has the next generation of
restaurants got what it takes

00:30.720 --> 00:33.920
to become a multi-million
pound business?

00:33.960 --> 00:38.720
Over the next six weeks,
here in Manchester,
the food capital of the north,

00:38.760 --> 00:41.680
12 of the most exciting
new restaurant ideas

00:41.720 --> 00:44.440
are in with the chance of
a life-changing investment

00:44.480 --> 00:47.920
from some of the UK's
most respected investors.

00:47.960 --> 00:52.800
These are the men
and women who can turn
an idea into a national brand.

00:52.840 --> 00:57.280
We're looking at putting
a lot of money into
the absolute best concept.

00:57.320 --> 00:59.360
This is the kind of model
that you dream of.

00:59.400 --> 01:03.520
If I find the right operator,
I'll be fighting for it.

01:05.080 --> 01:07.440
[Fred] Each week,
the investors will
give the people

01:07.480 --> 01:11.080
behind two great food ideas
a unique opportunity...

01:11.120 --> 01:12.680
Ah, this is brilliant.

01:12.720 --> 01:15.000
-[Fred] ...their own
pop-up restaurant.
-[bell dinging]

01:15.040 --> 01:18.200
-Right. Rock 'n' roll, man!
-[Fred] They'll have just
three days to prove...

01:18.240 --> 01:20.200
Nobody seems to know
the table numbers...

01:20.240 --> 01:22.520
-[Fred] ...they've
got what it takes...
-It's a disaster.

01:22.560 --> 01:24.320
[Fred] ...to make it
on the high street.

01:24.360 --> 01:26.600
When you start to rush,
that's when you start
to make more mistakes.

01:26.640 --> 01:28.560
-[clangs]
-There's a big backlog of
customers at the door.

01:28.600 --> 01:30.240
-[woman] Yeah, yeah.
-What are you
gonna do about it?

01:30.280 --> 01:34.960
If I was to invest,
it'll take half a million
to £750,000.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.120
Time to make some dough.

01:37.160 --> 01:41.560
[Fred] After the three days,
will the investors walk
back into the restaurant...

01:41.600 --> 01:44.360
-[sighs deeply]
-[Fred] ...and make them
an offer?

01:44.400 --> 01:46.400
It's a £600,000 lunch.

01:46.440 --> 01:49.440
We are not gonna leave
without an investment.

01:49.480 --> 01:51.400
I'm sorry.
Your time is up.

01:51.440 --> 01:53.080
The doors are open
for business.

01:53.120 --> 01:55.080
Welcome to
Million Pound Menu.

02:00.640 --> 02:03.800
Today, two new restaurants
arrive in Manchester

02:03.840 --> 02:07.400
to open their doors
to the paying public
for the very first time.

02:07.440 --> 02:10.200
Will they be able
to secure an investment

02:10.240 --> 02:12.600
or will they leave
empty-handed?

02:12.640 --> 02:15.120
And these are our lovely momos.

02:15.160 --> 02:17.000
Well worth the wait.

02:17.040 --> 02:18.720
[narrator] The men
and women behind

02:18.760 --> 02:21.600
some of the most
successful businesses
on the high street...

02:21.640 --> 02:25.440
We call it "Hug in a Box"
and we create a hug in
a box, like comfort food.

02:25.480 --> 02:28.160
[narrator]
...met to choose some of
the best new restaurant ideas

02:28.200 --> 02:30.720
for a three-day,
trial run pop-up.

02:30.760 --> 02:34.800
This is our signature
Libertine Burger, double ground
beef patty and friend pickles.

02:34.840 --> 02:39.200
There's an explosion
of these concepts that
are really successful.

02:39.240 --> 02:41.280
[narrator] They were looking
for the two entrepreneurs

02:41.320 --> 02:44.440
with the strongest food,
brand and business plan.

02:44.480 --> 02:47.200
I think this is a very good
plan that he's put together.

02:47.240 --> 02:50.200
It ticks a lot of boxes
in terms of being on trend.

02:50.240 --> 02:52.040
[narrator] Then each
investor had to decide

02:52.080 --> 02:55.480
whether they liked
the concept enough
to try it in Manchester.

02:55.520 --> 02:56.920
[sizzling]

02:56.960 --> 02:59.080
James is a proper grafter,
so he leads from the front

02:59.120 --> 03:01.360
which is something
that's very important to me.

03:01.400 --> 03:04.000
[narrator] The first idea
to get the investors excited?

03:04.040 --> 03:06.720
An experienced chef
and bartender duo

03:06.760 --> 03:10.160
who want to bring
great food and drink
to commuter belt towns.

03:10.200 --> 03:14.360
Hollings is a neighborhood
restaurant with central
London service standards

03:14.400 --> 03:17.000
and produce,
pulled out
to the commuter belts.

03:17.040 --> 03:19.880
[Ronnie] When I go back home
to Buckinghamshire,
James is out in Essex

03:19.920 --> 03:23.240
and there's good takeaways,
there's good Indian,
Chinese, there's good pubs...

03:23.280 --> 03:25.400
But the next level is,
you know, going back

03:25.440 --> 03:28.000
to the quiet dining rooms
with the big chairs...

03:28.040 --> 03:29.880
And it's stale
and it's stagnant.

03:29.920 --> 03:33.280
There's very much a gap
there, and we're the perfect
people to fill that.

03:33.320 --> 03:35.360
[narrator] Chef Ronnie
and barman James

03:35.400 --> 03:40.160
want £200,000 to set up
their first Hollings.

03:40.200 --> 03:42.480
Certainly where I live,
in Surrey,

03:42.520 --> 03:45.680
you're bored of all the good
concepts being in London.

03:45.720 --> 03:49.520
This is definitely
a concept that could
scale to multiple sites.

03:49.560 --> 03:51.840
Could you see ten Hollings?
Absolutely.

03:51.880 --> 03:55.800
The bar and restaurant
scene in major cities
is hyper-competitive.

03:55.840 --> 04:00.360
That means that you need
to generate a very high level
of profit to make a return.

04:00.400 --> 04:02.120
Actually, if you step away
from that market

04:02.160 --> 04:04.800
into suburban towns,
where your rents are lower,

04:04.840 --> 04:08.280
it's a compelling
strategy, if you can
get the offering right.

04:08.320 --> 04:11.320
I obviously run three
suburban restaurants,

04:11.360 --> 04:14.120
so I understand
their passion, where
they're coming from.

04:14.160 --> 04:15.880
And I understand
the economics of it.

04:15.920 --> 04:19.000
Hollings is a place where
people feel that

04:19.040 --> 04:20.680
it's their
neighborhood restaurant,

04:20.720 --> 04:23.400
where they know the chef,
where they know
the front of the house

04:23.440 --> 04:26.560
and they can walk in there
any time to have a chat
or have a drink.

04:26.600 --> 04:29.960
You can definitely make money
like that, because people
don't patronize you

04:30.000 --> 04:32.400
just for a day,
they patronize
you for their life.

04:32.440 --> 04:34.400
Because you become
part of their life.

04:34.440 --> 04:36.000
I wouldn't be amazed if
there'll be an arm wrestle

04:36.040 --> 04:38.720
between me and Imbiba,
but let's see.
[laughs]

04:38.760 --> 04:42.280
[Graham]
Guys, this is our signature
fettuccine Alfredo.

04:42.320 --> 04:46.200
It's slathered on
a giant wheel of cheese.
It's gonna blow your mind.

04:46.240 --> 04:49.000
[narrator] Next, an Italian
idea with a twist.

04:49.040 --> 04:53.440
Fresh pasta finished off on
a 40-kilogram cheese wheel.

04:53.480 --> 04:56.880
We are making fresh pasta,
then slathering it in

04:56.920 --> 05:01.160
a massive wheel
of Grana Padano
to infuse the flavors.

05:01.200 --> 05:06.080
[narrator] South African
born Graham is looking
for £500,000 investment.

05:06.120 --> 05:09.480
[Graham] It's been a massive
hit on Instagram and the videos
have gone viral.

05:09.520 --> 05:11.440
I think everyone has
a secret fetish for cheese.

05:11.480 --> 05:13.720
Conceptually,
it's very simple to do.

05:13.760 --> 05:16.640
It's got a lot of theater.
It really connects
with millennials.

05:16.680 --> 05:19.280
They don't have any
Italian experience.

05:19.320 --> 05:20.880
-They're not Italian.
-It doesn't matter.

05:20.920 --> 05:23.240
For me that matters
because I am Italian.

05:23.280 --> 05:26.280
That key signature
dish is really strong.

05:26.320 --> 05:30.400
Cheese, fresh pasta,
you know... Seriously,
what's not to like?

05:30.440 --> 05:33.800
The impact of the cheese wheel,
I think it's potentially
a great hook.

05:33.840 --> 05:36.080
Every restaurant needs
a unique selling point,

05:36.120 --> 05:38.040
something that
differentiates it.

05:38.080 --> 05:41.440
You know, this guy's got
a great idea, great passion.
So, yeah, I'd like to see.

05:41.480 --> 05:43.680
[narrator] Two ideas
have been chosen.

05:43.720 --> 05:46.600
The Cheese Wheel's hopes
rest on just one person,

05:46.640 --> 05:49.920
but two investors
could end up fighting
over Hollings.

06:04.680 --> 06:06.400
[Fred] Today,
Manchester welcomes

06:06.440 --> 06:09.120
two new restaurant hopefuls,
The Cheese Wheel and Hollings.

06:09.160 --> 06:12.440
The next three days could
well change their business
fortune forever.

06:12.480 --> 06:14.200
[narrator] The two
ideas will take over

06:14.240 --> 06:17.560
identical existing restaurant
sites 100 yards apart.

06:18.760 --> 06:21.880
This morning, Graham
and James and Ronnie

06:21.920 --> 06:25.280
are about to see their new
restaurants for the first time.

06:27.160 --> 06:29.720
It looks good, actually.
It does look really good.

06:29.760 --> 06:31.360
-[James] After you.
-[Ronnie] Thank you.

06:33.200 --> 06:34.640
[James]
Oh wow, look at that.

06:34.680 --> 06:36.560
[narrator] Over the last month,

06:36.600 --> 06:39.640
they've been working
with a designer to bring
their restaurant to life.

06:39.680 --> 06:41.400
[Ronnie] That's great.

06:41.440 --> 06:43.680
-Looks bangin', doesn't it?
-[Ronnie]
Looks really nice, actually.

06:43.720 --> 06:47.120
[narrator] James and Ronnie
have worked for some of the
country's best restaurants,

06:47.160 --> 06:50.120
but this is their first time
in their own place.

06:50.160 --> 06:55.200
We're super excited
to see Hollings
actually become real.

06:55.240 --> 06:58.600
The first diners sit down,
first check comes through,

06:58.640 --> 07:00.520
first martini goes
to the table...

07:00.560 --> 07:03.360
It exists then,
so that's exciting.

07:05.480 --> 07:09.000
[narrator]
Thirty-eight-year-old Ronnie
has spent 20 years as a chef.

07:09.040 --> 07:13.040
His current main project
is running a supper club from
his home in south London.

07:13.080 --> 07:17.400
Slow-cooked here,
140 degrees, pressed it.

07:17.440 --> 07:20.360
Yeah, I'm very fortunate,
I get paid a living
to do my hobby,

07:20.400 --> 07:22.080
which is lovely, you know.

07:22.120 --> 07:24.720
My earliest memory
is knocking around
on my grandma's floor

07:24.760 --> 07:28.000
with an old set of
balance scales
weighing up dry pasta.

07:28.040 --> 07:30.440
pretending to cook
with a spoon and stuff, so...

07:30.480 --> 07:34.240
My mom was a cook for 29 years
in a school kitchen.

07:34.280 --> 07:36.040
Yeah, it was sort of
in the family.

07:36.080 --> 07:39.440
[narrator] 28-year-old
James is a rising bar
and cocktail star.

07:39.480 --> 07:43.080
He met Ronnie when they worked
together at an upmarket
London restaurant.

07:43.120 --> 07:46.960
I am, sort of,
the beverage side and front
of house side of Hollings

07:47.000 --> 07:50.360
and I've been in hospitality
in London for about 11 years.

07:50.400 --> 07:52.240
I think we make Hollings
credible for an investor.

07:52.280 --> 07:54.960
Between the two of us,
there's a large wealth
of experience.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.240
[narrator] Now,
Ronnie and James are
looking for £200,000

07:58.280 --> 07:59.880
to kick-start Hollings.

07:59.920 --> 08:02.880
And the right person
to back them.

08:02.920 --> 08:04.960
I think an ideal
investor for us would--

08:05.000 --> 08:07.480
It's gotta be somebody
who's gonna, sort of,
fit our character.

08:07.520 --> 08:09.520
We've got to like what
they've got on offer.

08:09.560 --> 08:12.320
They've got to like
what we've got on offer.
It's like a marriage.

08:12.360 --> 08:16.440
If it doesn't feel right,
don't do it,
because it's gonna end messy

08:16.480 --> 08:19.600
and it's gonna end in
a nasty divorce and someone's
gonna lose everything.

08:19.640 --> 08:22.760
But equally, I think,
it's probably as important
that the 120 covers

08:22.800 --> 08:25.440
we've got booked over
the next three days
have a good time.

08:25.480 --> 08:28.480
If we do that right,
then the investment
will probably come.

08:32.480 --> 08:35.120
-[Graham] Yeah, let's do it!
-[narrator] Opposite Hollings,

08:35.160 --> 08:39.080
Graham is also about
to see his restaurant
for the first time.

08:39.120 --> 08:41.520
This looks awesome!
So cool.

08:42.760 --> 08:45.080
Cheese Wheel!
Cheese Wheel!

08:45.120 --> 08:47.680
Unbelievable.
Look at the kitchen. Whoa!

08:47.720 --> 08:50.240
Get your pasta fresh, my sir!

08:50.280 --> 08:52.400
[narrator]
Thirty-five-year-old
Graham had a cheese wheel

08:52.440 --> 08:54.120
in Italy when on holiday,

08:54.160 --> 08:57.480
then brought the idea back
to Camden Market in London.

08:57.520 --> 09:00.440
Now, he's serving hundreds
of dishes a day.

09:00.480 --> 09:03.560
[Graham] An average week,
we're looking at about £8,000.

09:03.600 --> 09:06.640
Our best sales,
we're looking
at about 11 grand.

09:06.680 --> 09:09.240
Pretty mega for
a tiny little stall.

09:09.280 --> 09:12.880
We've had customers
online, on Facebook,
that actually have said,

09:12.920 --> 09:15.400
"The Cheese Wheel is
not just a gimmick.
We've gone and tried it.

09:15.440 --> 09:17.600
It's fresh-rolled pasta.
It's a convenience.

09:17.640 --> 09:20.400
It's something that's,
that there's not
enough of out there."

09:20.440 --> 09:23.040
[narrator] Now, Graham
wants £500,000

09:23.080 --> 09:27.040
so that The Cheese Wheel
can take its share of
the 24 million visits

09:27.080 --> 09:30.600
that were made to Britain's
Italian restaurants last year.

09:30.640 --> 09:34.480
I've got a wife and two
kids and I dream of
giving them a better future,

09:34.520 --> 09:37.240
of building something for them,
for the future also.

09:37.280 --> 09:39.880
So it's something I want
to achieve in my life
if possible, you know.

09:39.920 --> 09:42.120
That's what
I'm aiming for.

09:47.280 --> 09:49.600
[narrator]
Tomorrow, in just
24 hours,

09:49.640 --> 09:52.480
the investors will be
arriving for a private lunch.

09:52.520 --> 09:54.440
Right, rock 'n' roll, man.
Let's go.

09:54.480 --> 09:57.440
[narrator] So tonight,
each restaurant has
just one practice run

09:57.480 --> 10:00.560
to get their menu
and service right.

10:00.600 --> 10:03.160
[Fred] Tonight,
both restaurants open
to the paying public

10:03.200 --> 10:04.440
for the first time.

10:04.480 --> 10:06.400
It's their soft launch.

10:06.440 --> 10:09.920
I've done so many in my time
and believe me, they never
go according to plan,

10:09.960 --> 10:13.000
but that's the point,
because they must
learn from tonight.

10:13.040 --> 10:16.640
Tomorrow, there will be
no room for error when
the investors arrive.

10:17.480 --> 10:18.920
Hey, buddy.

10:18.960 --> 10:20.440
[narrator] Both restaurants
have brought their own teams

10:20.480 --> 10:22.640
to help in the kitchen
and with front of house.

10:24.160 --> 10:25.920
[groans]

10:25.960 --> 10:28.600
[narrator]
And the man with the cheese
wheel is Graham's twin brother.

10:30.960 --> 10:33.040
Johnny, you're doing
a sterling job, mate.

10:34.680 --> 10:38.160
Buongiorno!
How are you?

10:38.200 --> 10:41.240
-Oh, you're making pasta.
Oh beautiful!
-[Graham] I love pasta!

10:41.280 --> 10:43.720
-What a very good
quality, this pasta!
-[Graham] Thank you.

10:43.760 --> 10:45.920
Tell me about
this cheese wheel,
because I'm really intrigued.

10:45.960 --> 10:50.040
I mean, do you actually
serve all your pasta in
a Parmesan wheel like this?

10:50.080 --> 10:54.080
So what we do is we cook
our fettuccine Alfredo nice
and hot and put it on top

10:54.120 --> 10:57.280
-and it infuses the flavors
from the wheel...
-Really?

10:57.320 --> 10:59.920
And it makes a cheesy
white wine Alfredo
type of sauce.

10:59.960 --> 11:02.720
[Fred] So how many wheels
like this do you go
through a week?

11:02.760 --> 11:05.160
[Graham]
I only go through one
every few days, I'd say.

11:05.200 --> 11:07.280
But it's not too
expensive to do that?

11:07.320 --> 11:09.440
-We make our mark up on it.
-Oh, really?

11:09.480 --> 11:11.600
-Yeah, yeah.
-Yeah, there's a lot
of dough in pasta, isn't there?

11:11.640 --> 11:14.760
Good, good, good.
Well, today you have
your first service here.

11:14.800 --> 11:16.560
-I hope it goes well for you.
-Thank you. Thank you.

11:16.600 --> 11:19.320
-And enjoy it. Ciao. Ciao.
-Lovely to meet you. Take care.

11:21.560 --> 11:26.360
[narrator] The Cheese Wheel's
star dish is
fettuccine Alfredo.

11:26.400 --> 11:28.760
Fresh pasta is cooked
in double cream,

11:28.800 --> 11:32.800
then swirled hot on the wheel
to pick up melting cheese.

11:32.840 --> 11:38.800
It's £6.50,
with toppings
like sheep's milk cheese extra.

11:38.840 --> 11:43.160
But Graham's decided to add
dishes to his Manchester menu.

11:43.200 --> 11:45.560
[Graham]
We've taken some risks,
we haven't played it safe.

11:45.600 --> 11:50.120
I really wanted
to show the investors
this isn't just a fad,

11:50.160 --> 11:51.600
a one trick pony.

11:51.640 --> 11:55.400
This can be developed into
something much more beautiful.

11:55.440 --> 11:59.760
[narrator]
Fresh pappardelle
with lamb ragu is £9.25,

11:59.800 --> 12:05.160
and squid ink spaghetti
with fresh clams in a white
wine sauce is £10.25.

12:07.560 --> 12:11.000
Right, boys, you got bacon
sandwiches ready, yeah?
A bit of brekkie.

12:11.040 --> 12:15.720
Most important is to make sure
that everyone is looked after.
Happy, happy staff.

12:15.760 --> 12:18.320
-How are you guys?
-Just in time for
a bacon sandwich.

12:18.360 --> 12:20.240
-Good. How are you?
-Very well, thank you.
How are you?

12:20.280 --> 12:21.880
Good. Very good. Thank you.
Nice to meet you.

12:21.920 --> 12:23.320
So what is Hollings then?

12:23.360 --> 12:25.680
-That's a very good question.
-[James] Yeah. Absolutely.

12:25.720 --> 12:27.800
It's authentic, sort of,
British cuisine,

12:27.840 --> 12:31.480
a bit of provenance,
quality service
and amazing drinks.

12:31.520 --> 12:34.680
But I suppose
the USP or the hook is that

12:34.720 --> 12:38.280
we're gonna pull it
to commuter belts,
out of central London.

12:38.320 --> 12:39.960
It's slightly more
than a pub,

12:40.000 --> 12:43.440
it's slightly
more affordable than
the fine dining restaurants.

12:43.480 --> 12:45.080
Very good.
And what about drinks, then?

12:45.120 --> 12:47.080
You say fantastic drinks.
What have you got in there?

12:47.120 --> 12:50.520
We're not labour-intensive,
shaky-shaky cocktails
anymore, right?

12:50.560 --> 12:54.920
The world's moved on.
Just quality products and just
a really simple serve, really.

12:54.960 --> 12:58.360
Good. All right, well guys,
have a good day
and I'll see you later on.

12:58.400 --> 13:00.800
-[James] See you later.
-Take care, take care.
Bye.

13:00.840 --> 13:04.520
[Ronnie] Right, well.
Let's do a little checklist.

13:04.560 --> 13:06.720
-Sweet corn.
-Yeah, right.

13:06.760 --> 13:10.480
[narrator] On average,
we now eat out 100
times a year in the UK.

13:10.520 --> 13:13.280
-Tatar sauce we need to mix.
-Yeah.

13:13.320 --> 13:17.840
[narrator] And the long
Hollings menu is designed for
familiarity and repeat visits.

13:17.880 --> 13:20.320
-Wait, let's put..
-So add seaweed salt.

13:20.360 --> 13:25.320
[narrator] Its 26 items
include a crispy
lamb-belly snack at £3.50,

13:25.360 --> 13:28.840
Rump of beef carpaccio
at £7.25,

13:28.880 --> 13:35.760
and Alfie's Fish 'n' Chips,
named after one of Ronnie's
proteges at £14.50.

13:35.800 --> 13:38.920
And James' drinks are
a big part of the offering.

13:38.960 --> 13:44.160
Four of his Teeny Tinis,
miniature versions of
classic martinis, cost £10.

13:52.880 --> 13:55.320
[James] Ron. 6:30.

13:55.360 --> 13:57.240
-See you on the other side.
-See you on
the other side, mate.

13:59.080 --> 14:02.360
[Fred] In my own
restaurant, I love that
feeling before service.

14:02.400 --> 14:04.080
Everything must be ready,

14:04.120 --> 14:06.440
the waiters must be
standing to attention,

14:06.480 --> 14:08.680
and when the first customer
walks through the door...

14:08.720 --> 14:09.880
-Hello.
-[woman] Hi.

14:09.920 --> 14:12.080
-How are you?
-The battle is on!

14:12.120 --> 14:13.800
I was going to say,
"Have you been
to Hollings before?"

14:13.840 --> 14:16.160
-But I know you haven't.
-[laughter]

14:16.200 --> 14:19.480
[narrator] Tonight's
soft-launch features
half-price food,

14:19.520 --> 14:22.120
so both restaurants
are booked solid.

14:22.720 --> 14:24.120
Table nine, yeah?

14:24.160 --> 14:26.600
Fettuccine, pancetta,
fettuccine, pancetta.
Thank you.

14:26.640 --> 14:29.200
-We're both gonna
get the Alfredo.
-Okay, yeah.

14:29.240 --> 14:33.600
[narrator] In the Cheese Wheel,
most of the customers want
to try the signature dish.

14:33.640 --> 14:36.880
-I'll go with
the fettuccine Alfredo.
-[waiter] Yeah.

14:36.920 --> 14:39.800
-Can I have
the fettuccine Alfredo as well?
-[waiter] Yeah.

14:39.840 --> 14:42.000
-[woman] I'm gonna go
for the same.
-Yeah.

14:42.040 --> 14:43.840
Fettuccine Alfredo
with pancetta,

14:43.880 --> 14:45.640
Fettuccine Alfredo
with smoked pork.

14:45.680 --> 14:48.080
-It's all fettuccine tonight.
-[bell dings]

14:48.120 --> 14:51.800
We've just come back from
Rome, and the pasta
there is, like, amazing,

14:51.840 --> 14:53.520
but that measured up
to it as well.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.960
Like, it was literally,
one of the best pastas
I've ever had.

14:57.600 --> 14:59.960
Hi, guys, how are you?
Can I sit at the bar?

15:00.000 --> 15:02.120
Thank you.
How are you doing?

15:02.160 --> 15:03.960
-You all right?
-Very well. Thank you.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.680
Okay, come on guys.
Fettuccine Alfredo,
fettuccine Alfredo with pesto.

15:07.720 --> 15:11.360
I like the menu. In fact,
I love it. I want to eat
everything on it.

15:11.400 --> 15:15.320
But the thing is, there's
only one dish that's cooked
using that wheel.

15:15.360 --> 15:17.760
-How's it going, Graham?
-It's going very good.
Thank you.

15:17.800 --> 15:20.120
[Fred]
How popular is
the wheel tonight?

15:20.160 --> 15:22.320
Uh, I'd say 80% of orders.

15:22.360 --> 15:23.840
-[Fred] 80%?
-Yeah.

15:23.880 --> 15:26.480
People have come for
the cheese wheel
experience, I think.

15:26.520 --> 15:27.880
[Fred] Thank you very much.

15:31.040 --> 15:32.840
Oh!

15:32.880 --> 15:36.560
What flavor!
So well-integrated.
It's beautiful.

15:36.600 --> 15:37.920
Now, if you'll excuse me.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.520
-I'll put the fettuccine
straight in, Chef.
-Good.

15:42.560 --> 15:47.480
And yeah, Pepe,
fettuccine Alfredo,
pancetta, sauteed mushroom.

15:47.520 --> 15:50.080
Okay, two fettuccine
ready to go!

15:50.120 --> 15:52.200
-Graham, thank you very much.
-[Graham] Thank you.
Have a wonderful evening.

15:52.240 --> 15:54.560
-See you later.
-Two fettuccine
coming out right away!

15:54.600 --> 15:56.160
They're done. Ready to go.

15:57.240 --> 15:58.480
We've got
no more cream left.

16:00.480 --> 16:03.280
Okay, well, that means
Alfredo's off the menu.

16:03.320 --> 16:05.560
Yeah, let's have a look.

16:05.600 --> 16:07.440
[waitress] What's going on?
What's happened?

16:07.480 --> 16:09.760
Uh, we've run out
of white-wine cream

16:09.800 --> 16:12.120
because we've been so busy
with the fettuccine.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.480
[sighing deeply]

16:18.720 --> 16:20.920
Back, back, back...

16:20.960 --> 16:22.400
[narrator] In Hollings...

16:22.440 --> 16:25.720
-Venison, mac and cheese.
No messing about.
-[laughter]

16:25.760 --> 16:28.440
[narrator]
...the menu is proving popular.

16:28.480 --> 16:31.160
-So two hummus,
three carpaccio, yeah?
-Yes, Chef.

16:31.200 --> 16:32.960
Fuckin' hell.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.920
We're fucking up!
It needs to be
a lot easier than this.

16:35.960 --> 16:38.360
[narrator]
But 45 minutes into service,

16:38.400 --> 16:40.360
no mains have
left the kitchen.

16:41.600 --> 16:43.360
[waiter]
How's everything here so far?

16:43.400 --> 16:45.240
-I know you haven't eaten
anything to eat yet, but...
-Oh, very good.

16:45.280 --> 16:47.800
It's on the way.
It's gonna be worth the wait.

16:47.840 --> 16:50.440
Um, you're food is
about seconds away,
I believe.

16:50.480 --> 16:52.800
It's the first day
so it's always gonna
be a bit ropey.

16:52.840 --> 16:54.640
-Give me a lemon wedge.
-Lemon?

16:54.680 --> 16:56.360
Uh, lemon wedges.

16:56.400 --> 16:58.320
[Ronnie] What we didn't have
time to do was
go through the flow

16:58.360 --> 17:00.360
and where everything works,

17:00.400 --> 17:02.600
so we're running around
doing 50 miles walking,
probably that we don't need to.

17:04.960 --> 17:07.000
-Hi, you guys.
-Can I sit you at the bar?
Is that all right?

17:07.040 --> 17:08.440
-Just yourself?
-[Fred] Yeah, just me, yeah.

17:08.480 --> 17:09.680
-[waiter] Lovely.
-Thank you.

17:09.720 --> 17:11.480
-How are you, Chef?
-I don't know. Fuck me!

17:11.520 --> 17:13.560
-Chef, how's it going?
-Sorry. Sorry.

17:13.600 --> 17:15.160
-Table-- What's that?
-How's it going?

17:15.200 --> 17:17.560
Oh, good, thank you.
Yeah. Sorry. Table three.

17:17.600 --> 17:20.360
Mac, fish 'n' chips...
That's the first
main course out.

17:21.600 --> 17:23.600
It's all right. It's all right.

17:23.640 --> 17:26.360
-I have your wines
here for you.
-Thank you.

17:26.400 --> 17:30.480
There's a lovely
atmosphere here in
Hollings. I really like it.

17:30.520 --> 17:32.800
Behind the scenes though,
it's manic.

17:32.840 --> 17:37.040
Check on one carpaccio,
one smoked salmon,
one venison and one chicken.

17:37.080 --> 17:39.120
Wait, you got truffle
on this mac?

17:39.160 --> 17:41.560
-Yeah.
-So give me two salmon now.

17:41.600 --> 17:43.400
I'm gonna do three carpaccio.

17:43.440 --> 17:45.880
-[James] Hello, lovely people.
How are you doing?
-Very well, thank you.

17:45.920 --> 17:48.800
Fucking hell. Do I have
to do everything?
Do we have the starters next?

17:48.840 --> 17:50.680
-Sorry, Chef.
Coming right up!
-Starters, starters!

17:50.720 --> 17:52.920
Right.
I say we double up here.
Two mac, two steak.

17:52.960 --> 17:54.360
-One venison.
-Yeah.

17:54.400 --> 17:56.000
And then we'll go
that as well. Same time, yeah?

17:56.040 --> 17:57.920
Yes, Chef!

17:57.960 --> 18:00.240
-There's a little nibble, Fred
while you're waiting.
-Thank you very much.

18:00.280 --> 18:04.120
A little crispy lamb belly
and a sweet corn fritter.

18:04.160 --> 18:06.440
Right. Jus, steaks, chips.

18:08.080 --> 18:10.520
I'm just waiting
for my main course,
but the chef is very kind

18:10.560 --> 18:14.280
and sent me these little
things to nibble on. This is
really good, really class.

18:17.200 --> 18:18.760
-Hi guys.
-Hi.

18:18.800 --> 18:21.000
Just to let you know,
the fettuccine that
you've ordered,

18:21.040 --> 18:22.760
they're out of the cream
white wine sauce.

18:22.800 --> 18:25.480
-Okay.
-Um, so it will be done
with the mushroom sauce.

18:25.520 --> 18:27.200
[narrator] With customers
still ordering,

18:27.240 --> 18:29.960
Graham has had
to improvise a new dish
for The Cheese Wheel.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.440
We've sold, like,
about 80 to 90%
of fettuccine tonight.

18:33.480 --> 18:37.040
Hiya, ladies. I'm sure
you've heard about
the problem with, uh...

18:37.080 --> 18:39.160
The cream sauce
and fettuccine.

18:39.200 --> 18:42.680
We just apologized
to the customers
and changed the sauce

18:42.720 --> 18:46.640
to mushroom cream
and gonna finish off
the night on a high note.

18:52.840 --> 18:55.120
-[Ronnie] No need to stay that
long 'cause we've got it, yeah?
-[waiter] Yes, Chef.

18:55.160 --> 18:57.280
We give you a venison
and a venison.

18:57.320 --> 18:59.240
[waiter]
Has Table two gone yet, Chef?

18:59.280 --> 19:03.040
[narrator] In Hollings,
Ronnie and James have
got service back on track.

19:03.080 --> 19:05.480
[James] Hello, lovely people.
Help yourself here--

19:05.520 --> 19:08.680
Chips coming up
for that steak right now!

19:08.720 --> 19:12.040
My dad once told me
that if you know how to drive,
you can drive any car.

19:12.080 --> 19:14.240
Well, it's the same
for restaurants.
It doesn't matter whether

19:14.280 --> 19:16.680
it's your first night or not,
or whether you know
the restaurant or not,

19:16.720 --> 19:19.760
if you know how to do it,
you know how to do it.
These guys know.

19:19.800 --> 19:21.720
-[James] How's everything?
Worth the wait?
-[woman] Very nice.

19:21.760 --> 19:23.160
[man] Oh, look at that bad boy.

19:24.640 --> 19:28.000
The service is great,
the food's delicious.

19:28.040 --> 19:31.440
Even, like, where we lived
in a small town, it would work.

19:31.480 --> 19:33.960
Last check. Done. Done.

19:50.560 --> 19:52.680
-[Ronnie] Big day today, so...
-[man] Yes, Chef.

19:52.720 --> 19:56.200
It's only a few people but
nonetheless, possibly the most
important people of the week.

19:56.240 --> 19:59.440
-We've got about an hour
and a half till service.
-[Ronnie] No problem.

19:59.480 --> 20:02.480
Last night's service put
both kitchens to the test.

20:02.520 --> 20:06.960
Today, the investors expect
a lunch par excellence.

20:07.000 --> 20:11.320
Their first impression
of each business is all
about the food on the plate.

20:11.360 --> 20:14.720
They must get it right if
they are to stay in the game.

20:14.760 --> 20:17.080
[narrator] Over the next
two days, the investors

20:17.120 --> 20:20.480
will test the restaurants
on their service
and business plans.

20:20.520 --> 20:24.040
But today's private lunch
is all about the food.

20:24.080 --> 20:27.800
Ronnie's trying to treat it
as just another day
at the office.

20:27.840 --> 20:31.240
I think certainly, once you get
in a kitchen, it's a fantastic,
friendly atmosphere.

20:31.280 --> 20:34.840
It can be a little bit,
you know, hostile during
the middle of service,

20:34.880 --> 20:38.200
but you know, generally,
everybody wants you to do well

20:38.240 --> 20:41.680
and everyone helps you out,
so I think that's probably
taught me a lot.

20:41.720 --> 20:45.600
Yeah, I think sometimes
it has been a little bit of
a struggle having a disability.

20:45.640 --> 20:48.360
I was a classic victim.
I mean, I'm in the supermarket
and they said,

20:48.400 --> 20:50.480
"Do you want to pack
your bags?" It's got
nothing to do with my arm,

20:50.520 --> 20:52.360
it's because they want
to pack your bags...

20:52.400 --> 20:54.560
Five years ago, I would've
gone, "No, I'm all right.
I can pack my own bags."

20:54.600 --> 20:57.960
You know, my parents were
great in bringing me up

20:58.000 --> 20:59.560
and they taught me to be
very independent,

20:59.600 --> 21:01.600
so I think sometimes
people are just
genuinely being nice

21:01.640 --> 21:04.720
and you take it a little bit
the wrong way.

21:04.760 --> 21:06.000
-Morning.
-[James] Good morning.

21:06.040 --> 21:07.600
-How are you guys?
-How you doing, Fred?

21:07.640 --> 21:08.760
Very good, thank you.

21:08.800 --> 21:10.560
-Are you ready for lunch?
-[Ronnie] Yeah.

21:10.600 --> 21:13.360
You had a good soft launch
yesterday, but today is all
about the food.

21:13.400 --> 21:15.200
-[Ronnie] Yeah, yeah.
-The food has to be perfect.

21:15.240 --> 21:17.800
-There's no room for error.
-It's a little bit, a little
bit daunting,

21:17.840 --> 21:21.000
but I've got belief
in the brand, belief
in the product.

21:21.040 --> 21:24.760
And I think that
the only thing we can do
now is do the job right,

21:24.800 --> 21:26.800
and then, if we walk
away without it

21:26.840 --> 21:29.280
at least you can turn
around to yourself and say
you've done your best.

21:29.320 --> 21:31.960
-Can you make them
fall in love with Hollings?
-Absolutely.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.440
-Yeah. I hope so.
-All right. Well,
good luck, guys.

21:34.480 --> 21:36.520
-[James] Thank you. Cheers.
-Good luck. See you later.

21:36.560 --> 21:38.000
Right, rock 'n' roll, man.

21:38.040 --> 21:40.240
-A little pick-me-up
Negroni before service.
-Nice!

21:42.880 --> 21:44.560
[clicks tongue]
That's the one, mate.

21:47.160 --> 21:50.000
[narrator] Hollings is hosting
Darrel Connell of Imbiba

21:50.040 --> 21:53.400
and partners Fraser Bradshaw
and Simon Wheeler.

21:53.440 --> 21:57.720
They've invested over
50 million pounds in
hospitality start-ups.

21:57.760 --> 22:00.320
When we first saw Hollings,
the thing that really stood out

22:00.360 --> 22:03.200
was the pedigree
and the quality of
James and Ronnie,

22:03.240 --> 22:05.440
proven operators who have
been doing it for years

22:05.480 --> 22:08.360
who want to take that
big leap and go at it alone.

22:08.400 --> 22:10.640
We offer no qualms about
making an investment

22:10.680 --> 22:14.280
of between half a million
and a million pounds
initially in Hollings,

22:14.320 --> 22:17.080
but with a view then
to putting a further
five million into Hollings.

22:17.120 --> 22:20.400
What I'm really looking forward
to seeing is have the guys
got the appetite for that?

22:20.440 --> 22:23.280
Do they want
to build Hollings into
a great British business?

22:23.320 --> 22:25.320
Are these guys
money makers?

22:29.040 --> 22:30.960
[narrator] Imbiba
face competition.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.920
Michelin starred
restaurateur, Atul Kochhar,

22:33.960 --> 22:37.440
who's looking to expand
his UK restaurant portfolio.

22:37.480 --> 22:39.400
[Atul] Finding new ideas
is always exciting

22:39.440 --> 22:43.640
because it kind of
connects you to the future,
what's coming next.

22:43.680 --> 22:46.280
I always look at ideas
in different ways.

22:46.320 --> 22:49.480
It's just not
whether the financial
sense is there or not,

22:49.520 --> 22:51.800
but also whether
we are working with
the right ethos or not.

22:51.840 --> 22:55.000
All that is very important
to me. And people,
their commitment,

22:55.040 --> 23:00.000
whether they are really
hard graft or not, and if
that's not going to work out,

23:00.040 --> 23:02.520
then you might as well
just don't make
the investment.

23:05.000 --> 23:08.440
I'm quite excited about
Hollings. I'm pretty much
sold on the idea.

23:08.480 --> 23:12.720
And I do hope that
they fare well, to be
honest, because...

23:12.760 --> 23:15.240
It's almost like
it's theirs to lose.

23:15.280 --> 23:17.240
[Darrel] I know
Atul's expressed
an interest in Hollings.

23:17.280 --> 23:19.520
If we have to go head-to-head,
we have to go head-to-head.

23:24.320 --> 23:26.160
After you.

23:26.200 --> 23:28.400
-[James] Hello.
How are you doing?
-Hello, hello.

23:28.440 --> 23:29.560
-Darrel.
-Welcome to Hollings. James.

23:29.600 --> 23:31.080
-Nice to meet you.
-Very nice to meet you.

23:31.120 --> 23:32.400
-Hello, there.
How are you doing?
-Fraser.

23:32.440 --> 23:33.920
[James]
Fantastic. You wanna
take a seat?

23:33.960 --> 23:35.960
-Thanks very much.
-Thank you.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
[James] I'm sort of
predominantly drinks, and to
start there's some Teeny Tinis,

23:38.040 --> 23:41.120
little miniature versions
of, sort of, longer drinks.

23:41.160 --> 23:42.840
There's your classic Negroni...

23:42.880 --> 23:44.440
And there's a little
bergamot Bellini,

23:44.480 --> 23:46.840
and then there's
a pepper with gin martini.

23:48.280 --> 23:50.040
It's a nice idea, actually.

23:50.080 --> 23:53.280
-Kind of canopy drinks.
-Canopy drinks. Yeah,
I definitely think so.

23:53.320 --> 23:56.680
[narrator] On the menu today,
26 different items

23:56.720 --> 24:00.800
from smoked salmon
to mac 'n' cheese to
apple pie and custard.

24:00.840 --> 24:02.440
-Gosh, it's quite a--
-Quite a lot, yeah.

24:02.480 --> 24:03.680
It's quite an extensive
menu, isn't it?

24:03.720 --> 24:06.040
If you do a calculation
across Tiny Tinis,

24:06.080 --> 24:10.280
and across your snacks
and starters and mains
and including wine,

24:10.320 --> 24:12.920
it ends being a pretty
strong expense per head.

24:12.960 --> 24:16.520
-[Atul] Yeah, a good £60.
-Yeah, a good £60.

24:16.560 --> 24:19.120
-Gents, are we ready
to order?
-Yeah.

24:19.160 --> 24:21.840
This is one of the biggest
services of our lives.

24:21.880 --> 24:24.560
The easiest way to put it,
it's a half a million
pound service, isn't it?

24:24.600 --> 24:28.440
We're gonna have one of
all of the starters and then,
just share it around.

24:28.480 --> 24:30.400
-So one of every starter?
-Yeah.

24:30.440 --> 24:32.400
And for the mains?

24:32.440 --> 24:34.240
-Let's do one thing. Let's
have all six, and we'd try it.
-I think we'll do all.

24:34.280 --> 24:37.440
-Fantastic. They're gonna
have one of each starter.
-Yeah.

24:37.480 --> 24:38.960
-Again, one of each main.
-Yeah.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.400
And then, just a selection
of sides, whatever you like.

24:41.440 --> 24:43.560
-So, the whole lot,
yeah? The whole lot.
-I think so.

24:43.600 --> 24:46.760
-Yes, Chef.
-Well! Check on.

24:46.800 --> 24:48.600
-Yes, Chef?
-The whole menu.

24:48.640 --> 24:49.920
-Yeah?
-Get busy.

24:49.960 --> 24:51.080
-[chuckles]
-Fantastic.

24:53.920 --> 24:56.000
[Graham]
Oh, they're looking good,
Chef, they're looking good.

24:56.040 --> 24:58.280
[narrator] In the Cheese Wheel,
Graham's making sure

24:58.320 --> 25:01.320
everything is perfect
for today's
make-or-break lunch.

25:01.360 --> 25:03.400
I'm a little bit nervous
but definitely on track.

25:08.360 --> 25:14.080
[narrator] Graham's one shot at
investment is Jeremy Roberts,
CEO of Living Ventures.

25:14.120 --> 25:17.960
He runs a string of over
40 bars and restaurants.

25:18.000 --> 25:19.880
[Jeremy] I think
the two main things

25:19.920 --> 25:22.720
from a pure investment
point of view are
customer acceptability...

25:22.760 --> 25:25.480
Italian food has almost
become a default.

25:25.520 --> 25:27.560
British food, you know,
we all understand it.

25:27.600 --> 25:29.760
The second thing is,
the profitability side

25:29.800 --> 25:32.600
of The Cheese Wheel offer
should be really positive.

25:32.640 --> 25:36.760
Pasta isn't very expensive,
but if a cheese wheel is
the only thing it's got,

25:36.800 --> 25:38.720
then I would be
slightly concerned,

25:38.760 --> 25:41.880
so we need to see what
the breadth of the offer is.

25:47.280 --> 25:49.240
-Hello.
-Hello.

25:49.280 --> 25:50.960
Lovely to meet you.
My name's Graham.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.840
-Nice to meet you, Graham.
-And this is our famous
cheese wheel.

25:52.880 --> 25:55.560
-I've heard a lot
about it. Yeah.
-Come have a look.

25:55.600 --> 25:59.120
So this is our aged,
40-kilo Grana Padano wheel.

25:59.160 --> 26:03.120
And our specialty in
Camden Market is actually
making a fettuccine Alfredo.

26:03.160 --> 26:04.920
So what would you
recommend, Graham?

26:04.960 --> 26:07.000
Our signature dish
is something I'd really
like for you to try first--

26:07.040 --> 26:08.640
We've gotta try that.

26:08.680 --> 26:10.240
[narrator]
Before he can use
the cheese wheel each day...

26:10.280 --> 26:11.720
So I'm to stand back.

26:11.760 --> 26:14.160
[narrator]
...it has to be sterilized
with brandy.

26:14.200 --> 26:16.640
So this is not
integral to the flavor
of the dish in any way...

26:16.680 --> 26:19.560
-No.
-It's just a question
of sanitizing the surface.

26:19.600 --> 26:22.360
-Yeah, exactly.
-[Jeremy] Cool. Sure.

26:23.480 --> 26:25.400
-Just-- Just try it.
-Yes.

26:25.440 --> 26:26.480
-Happy?
-Yes.

26:26.520 --> 26:27.560
Not bad, yeah.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.440
-[Jeremy] Good?
-I think you're gonna like it.

26:32.880 --> 26:35.520
-Okay. This is our
fettuccine Alfredo.
-Yeah.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
[Graham] This is where
the magic happens.

26:39.040 --> 26:41.240
-[Jeremy] So that goes
straight on there?
-Yes, so we...

26:41.280 --> 26:43.480
-We're not gonna--
-Knock it around...

26:43.520 --> 26:45.960
-We burnt off all the alcohol
so they don't get any flavor.
-Yeah.

26:47.480 --> 26:49.960
-It certainly
gets the taste buds going.
-[Graham] Yeah.

26:52.640 --> 26:55.120
-[Jeremy] I'm trying to do
this elegantly.
-[laughs]

26:57.760 --> 26:59.240
Thank you.

27:07.880 --> 27:10.000
Yeah. It's just
picking up the, um...

27:10.040 --> 27:11.760
It's picking up some alcohol.
I was worried about that,

27:11.800 --> 27:14.240
-because we had
a bit of a dip there.
-Hmm.

27:14.280 --> 27:15.880
It, uh... Yeah, okay.

27:23.160 --> 27:26.160
-[man] About a minute
on the soup, Chef.
-Perfect.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.560
[waiter] So, here you have
the onion dish,

27:30.600 --> 27:32.760
and then you also have the
beef rump carpaccio as well.

27:32.800 --> 27:34.200
-[Atul] Sounds good.
-Thank you.

27:47.280 --> 27:49.240
He's looking at me
funny 'cause I'm looking
at him funny.

27:49.280 --> 27:50.560
[laughter]

27:56.760 --> 28:00.040
-It's brilliantly
prepared, isn't it?
-Really tasty.

28:00.080 --> 28:04.040
It's absolutely delicious.
Absolutely delicious.

28:04.080 --> 28:06.920
There's smiles and empty
plates and empty glasses.

28:06.960 --> 28:08.880
They're in for the marathon,
'cause there's a lot to go,

28:08.920 --> 28:11.160
if they're gonna have
one of everything,
there's a lot to go.

28:12.480 --> 28:14.400
Beautifully balanced.

28:14.440 --> 28:16.760
Every element
speaks for itself.

28:16.800 --> 28:19.640
Right. Chicken burger.

28:19.680 --> 28:22.840
Not just
any chicken burger,
a Hollings chicken burger.

28:22.880 --> 28:24.520
The food so far
all right?

28:24.560 --> 28:27.280
[man]
It's just so broad and varied.

28:27.320 --> 28:30.000
[Atul] With your experience
and your exposure,

28:30.040 --> 28:33.600
you could have found
the finance anywhere.
Why did you come to this?

28:33.640 --> 28:36.400
We came to this for
a very good reason, so...

28:36.440 --> 28:39.880
James and I have done
lots of things, lots of
outside events.

28:39.920 --> 28:43.840
I've got my own business
doing pop-ups and consulting.

28:43.880 --> 28:46.240
But what we need is some help,
some guidance, some advice.0

28:46.280 --> 28:50.200
And will you focus 100%
on Hollings if you get
some capital, you know--

28:50.240 --> 28:51.840
The honest answer is no.

28:54.680 --> 28:58.040
I'll have some other stuff
on the go because that's
the way I operate best.

28:58.080 --> 29:02.760
If I focus 100%
on one thing, I've found
out in the past, I get too...

29:02.800 --> 29:06.360
Too emotional,
too attached
and not objective enough.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.960
Anyway, I'll let you get
back to your food,

29:10.000 --> 29:12.120
otherwise we'll be here
till three o'clock
in the morning.

29:15.680 --> 29:18.320
He'll be in the kitchen
thinking, "I wish I had
never said that."

29:18.360 --> 29:20.680
-[chuckles]
-I hope you don't
go against this,

29:20.720 --> 29:23.880
but I gotta be honest, I said,
it ain't gonna be 100%.

29:23.920 --> 29:26.520
We know that.
We know
that conversation anyway.

29:29.520 --> 29:31.960
There's two here.
This is the one
you're cooking,

29:32.000 --> 29:34.440
and just a little bit extra
in there just in case
you needed it.

29:34.480 --> 29:35.720
[narrator]
In The Cheese Wheel...

29:35.760 --> 29:36.720
[man] Smells good.

29:37.600 --> 29:39.520
Lovely clams, yeah.

29:39.560 --> 29:43.600
[narrator] Jeremy's second dish
is Graham's new
squid-ink spaghetti.

29:47.080 --> 29:48.240
Looks great.

29:48.920 --> 29:49.800
[Graham] Enjoy.

29:54.360 --> 29:56.400
Hmm...

29:56.440 --> 29:57.960
-Yeah, that's really good.
-[Graham] You like it?

29:58.000 --> 29:59.760
-That's wonderful.
-Yeah.

29:59.800 --> 30:03.040
[Jeremy] He clearly
is talented in terms of
his ability to cook.

30:03.840 --> 30:05.160
The main course dishes that,

30:05.200 --> 30:07.200
that I've tried today
have been fantastic.
Yeah.

30:07.240 --> 30:11.000
The only slight issue is
that they're probably better
than the signature dish.

30:11.040 --> 30:13.240
Yeah, it's a bit of a concern.

30:13.280 --> 30:14.560
-Thanks very much.
-I hope you enjoyed it.

30:14.600 --> 30:16.440
-Pleasure to meet
you, Jeremy.
-And you.

30:16.480 --> 30:19.880
[Graham] Feeling quite
relieved that that part
of the service is over.

30:19.920 --> 30:22.800
In an ideal world, Jeremy
will come back tomorrow

30:22.840 --> 30:26.000
and taste the dish for what
it is without...

30:26.040 --> 30:27.560
A bit of brandy flavor
coming through.

30:29.480 --> 30:32.200
I mean, it is a crowded market,
the Italian market...

30:32.240 --> 30:35.560
The cheese wheel
front and center is
the thing about this.

30:35.600 --> 30:37.480
If it is going to be their
unique selling point,

30:37.520 --> 30:41.600
they need to make more of it
and it needs to be
the star of the show.

30:41.640 --> 30:44.800
Even though that version
of the signature dish

30:44.840 --> 30:47.400
I tried today
didn't quite come off,

30:47.440 --> 30:52.280
I'm really keen
to try it again, because
conceptually it should work.

30:52.320 --> 30:54.920
And clearly, in Camden,
it's working very well.

30:57.400 --> 30:58.440
Great meal, all in all.

30:58.480 --> 31:00.120
-Yeah.
-Yeah, I really--

31:00.160 --> 31:01.520
Shame about the company, but...

31:02.920 --> 31:04.200
-[all laughing]
-Thanks, Atul.

31:06.720 --> 31:09.760
There is absolutely
no doubt to us and Imbiba
that Ronnie is a great chef

31:09.800 --> 31:13.440
and that James is a great host
and a great drinks guy.

31:13.480 --> 31:15.920
But big question is,
are they business people?

31:15.960 --> 31:18.200
Ronnie, what an amazing
meal, thank you so much.

31:18.240 --> 31:20.640
-[chattering]
-He's such a great chef.

31:20.680 --> 31:24.480
The service was charming
and the hospitality
was just perfect.

31:24.520 --> 31:26.520
But one thing worries me.

31:26.560 --> 31:30.000
Ronnie, while talking to us,
mentioned that he will have
other things on the go.

31:30.040 --> 31:34.560
I'm not that kind of investor.
Others might be okay,
I'm not.

31:34.600 --> 31:37.840
-[Fred] How did it go?
-[Ronnie] It was very, very
good. Very good.

31:37.880 --> 31:39.240
Did they fall in love
with Hollings?

31:39.280 --> 31:40.600
-Yeah.
-[James] I think so.

31:40.640 --> 31:42.560
[Fred]
But you do realize
that if you go with it,

31:42.600 --> 31:45.440
they just want your full,
undivided attention
on that project.

31:45.480 --> 31:47.440
I mean, you have a lot
of projects going on.
I mean...

31:47.480 --> 31:49.720
-Yeah.
-Are you ready to give
them up just for Hollings?

31:49.760 --> 31:51.520
[James]
Let's be clear.
If we open Hollings,

31:51.560 --> 31:54.080
from day one,
first six months,
we're gonna own that.

31:54.120 --> 31:56.400
-[Ronnie] Yeah.
-But I don't think we're gonna
give up the other stuff.

31:56.440 --> 31:57.880
[Fred] But do you think
they'd be prepared to give you

31:57.920 --> 31:59.640
half a million pounds,
a million pounds

31:59.680 --> 32:02.000
if you're juggling
other responsibilities?

32:02.040 --> 32:03.680
We've said right
from the beginning

32:03.720 --> 32:05.840
that it's about
the right partnership
and the right investment.

32:05.880 --> 32:08.240
-It's gotta work all around.
-Right.

32:08.280 --> 32:11.000
Okay, well, good luck in your
financial meetings later on.

32:11.040 --> 32:12.800
-Thank you very much.
-[Ronnie]
It's gonna be interesting.

32:12.840 --> 32:15.440
-[Fred] See you later, guys.
-Thank you.
Cheers, Fred.

32:23.960 --> 32:27.840
[narrator] Tomorrow
lunchtime, the pressure in
the restaurant increases.

32:27.880 --> 32:32.440
The investors will get to see
how well they cope when they're
full of paying customers.

32:32.480 --> 32:35.520
Thank you.
Couldn't have
done it without you, boys.

32:35.560 --> 32:37.600
[narrator]
But today isn't over.

32:37.640 --> 32:42.320
Graham and Ronnie
and James still face private
meetings with the investors

32:42.360 --> 32:46.000
to talk through
their financial strategy
for the business.

32:46.040 --> 32:47.600
Hollings are first.

32:47.640 --> 32:49.800
[Fred] I've seen many
business plans in my time,

32:49.840 --> 32:53.560
but this one
clearly lacks detail,
especially around the numbers.

32:53.600 --> 32:57.880
James and Ronnie have
predicted half a million pound
turnover in year one,

32:57.920 --> 33:01.400
but a restaurant like that
should take double that,
a million pounds.

33:01.440 --> 33:04.760
They have to show that
they can run a business
as well as a kitchen.

33:06.080 --> 33:07.760
[narrator]
As they're in competition,

33:07.800 --> 33:11.560
each investor will have
an hour alone with
James and Ronnie.

33:11.600 --> 33:15.320
The financial side of the bar
and restaurant business
is the less sexy bit.

33:15.360 --> 33:18.640
You know, the great
cocktails or, you know,
the delicious steaks,

33:18.680 --> 33:22.400
that's all the stuff that
everyone wants to talk about,
but for us as investors,

33:22.440 --> 33:26.320
we need to understand that
the people that we're backing
take the numbers

33:26.360 --> 33:30.200
and the financial side of
these businesses very,
very, very seriously.

33:30.240 --> 33:34.080
'Cause without that,
my money could
evaporate very quickly.

33:34.120 --> 33:38.120
[narrator] Hollings are asking
for an investment of £200,000.

33:41.200 --> 33:43.360
-How was your day?
-Long day for
a four-cover lunch.

33:43.400 --> 33:44.880
[both laughing]

33:44.920 --> 33:47.920
And thank you so much
for fantastic food
and great service.

33:47.960 --> 33:48.960
[Ronnie] Great.

33:51.440 --> 33:53.200
-Numbers.
-[Ronnie] Yeah, numbers.

33:53.240 --> 33:55.960
[Atul] If I look
at the numbers, the labor cost

33:56.000 --> 33:58.080
is sitting somewhere
around £200,000.

33:58.120 --> 34:00.920
There's money in the budget
for a head chef or GM,

34:00.960 --> 34:03.080
and then obviously,
you know, bar and--

34:03.120 --> 34:04.400
[Atul] So,
how much are you paying?

34:04.440 --> 34:05.920
Because I don't have
the breakdown of the wages.

34:05.960 --> 34:08.720
I would expect that you would
need to find 40 to 45 grand

34:08.760 --> 34:11.640
for head chef,
and somewhere similar
for a GM.

34:11.680 --> 34:13.920
-[scoffs] 80 grand is gone.
-[Ronnie] Yeah.

34:13.960 --> 34:17.920
-So, what's left in
the budget is £120,000...
-Yeah.

34:17.960 --> 34:20.520
-Yeah.
-We can't get rest of
the stuff in £120,000.

34:21.920 --> 34:24.040
What we haven't been is
owners of a restaurant before,

34:24.080 --> 34:27.440
so it's based on the theory
of other people's...

34:27.480 --> 34:29.480
-[Atul] Okay.
-Other people's numbers.

34:33.200 --> 34:35.040
From a weekly
sales perspective,

34:35.080 --> 34:36.800
just taking
some headline numbers...

34:36.840 --> 34:39.240
Your expectation is 12,
12 and a half grand a week...

34:39.280 --> 34:41.520
For us, I mean, looking at this
and looking at the concept,

34:41.560 --> 34:44.360
you need to generate
a 25 to 30 grand a week.

34:45.920 --> 34:50.080
We understand that at the end
of the day, you need to

34:50.120 --> 34:52.480
cover your opening cost
and turn a profit.

34:52.520 --> 34:56.560
-The bits in between certainly
needs to put in some work.
-[Simon] Yes, so...

34:56.600 --> 34:58.440
Who prepared the spreadsheet?

34:58.480 --> 35:02.640
Predominantly myself,
and then we went
over it together.

35:02.680 --> 35:05.880
I guess the slight surprise
was that it didn't add up.

35:05.920 --> 35:10.160
Unless we've missed
something, it still doesn't
look like it does.

35:10.200 --> 35:13.400
[Simon] I'm concerned about
the business plan

35:13.440 --> 35:17.240
they presented to us
and the inaccuracies
in that plan.

35:17.280 --> 35:20.840
There wasn't the diligence
to check them,

35:20.880 --> 35:23.400
and I would have thought,
in a meeting like this,

35:23.440 --> 35:26.520
that they would've gone
through those numbers
very, very carefully.

35:28.560 --> 35:31.720
Now, let's take a step back
away from numbers.

35:31.760 --> 35:35.080
Imaginary restaurant is ready,
I have invested.

35:35.120 --> 35:38.080
Initially, you will
fulfill the head chef role?

35:38.120 --> 35:40.880
No, I'd like to go in
with a head chef.
Mentor a head chef.

35:40.920 --> 35:43.280
How much time you guys
will spend on it?

35:43.320 --> 35:46.120
I see us getting
our hands dirty

35:46.160 --> 35:49.120
for the first six months,
I'd imagine, until this is...

35:49.160 --> 35:51.680
Until it's up and running
and where we need it to get to.

35:51.720 --> 35:56.040
I'm glad that you know that
and you understand that.

35:56.080 --> 35:59.880
That's what I wanted
to hear from him today
and he exactly committed.

35:59.920 --> 36:03.200
He said if it takes six months,
I'll be there for six months
or maybe more.

36:03.240 --> 36:06.120
I was a bit confused about
you guys, I have to say that.

36:06.160 --> 36:08.440
Ronnie has got
an edgy personality,
no doubt about It.

36:08.480 --> 36:10.600
But I think it's a good
edgy personality.

36:10.640 --> 36:13.880
Uh, I'm warming up
to him now. I...

36:13.920 --> 36:18.040
He's confident, he knows
his product well, and I think
he can be trained.

36:18.080 --> 36:21.600
For you, Ronnie, especially,
being a chef and a very
confident chef,

36:21.640 --> 36:24.400
I felt that you were
a little arrogant,
but you're not.

36:24.440 --> 36:27.040
-I was wrong.
I read you wrong.
-Thanks.

36:27.080 --> 36:28.800
[Ronnie]
I don't know where he got
his opinion from.

36:28.840 --> 36:30.560
What you see is what you get.
I haven't changed.

36:30.600 --> 36:32.840
I haven't changed
my style in ten years, so...

36:32.880 --> 36:37.160
I don't know where he gets
that from.
It was unjust.

36:37.200 --> 36:40.560
[narrator] At the end of
the meeting, the investors
can choose to spell out

36:40.600 --> 36:45.480
the offer they'll make
if and only if they decide
to invest tomorrow.

36:45.520 --> 36:48.760
From finding the site
and fitting it out,

36:48.800 --> 36:54.360
I envisage it'll take us
easily anything between
half a million to £750,000.

36:54.400 --> 36:55.960
Yeah.

36:56.000 --> 36:59.120
We will be looking
at putting up to four,
five million pounds

36:59.160 --> 37:02.600
behind you potentially
to scale the business
into a brand.

37:02.640 --> 37:06.680
You know, we're not
single site investors,
if that makes sense.

37:06.720 --> 37:09.200
-Yeah.
-Over a three, four,
five year period,

37:09.240 --> 37:11.680
let's open six,
seven, eight sites.

37:11.720 --> 37:14.480
If everyone gets it right,
there's a big pot of gold
at the end of the rainbow.

37:14.520 --> 37:16.200
Yeah.

37:16.240 --> 37:18.800
We didn't expect that
when we walked into
the room, to be honest.

37:18.840 --> 37:22.360
[Ronnie]
We started with no restaurant,
no food even being on a plate.

37:22.400 --> 37:24.040
And now, we're talking
about somebody putting

37:24.080 --> 37:26.480
four, five million quid
and having that belief
in our product.

37:26.520 --> 37:28.240
You know, that's...
Hold on a minute...

37:28.280 --> 37:32.960
Let's go back 48 hours.
This is somewhat unbelievable.

37:33.000 --> 37:36.440
[Darrel] We're certainly going
to tomorrow's service
with an open mind.

37:36.480 --> 37:41.400
For me, it's not so much
about how good, you know,
how good the venison is,

37:41.440 --> 37:44.200
it's more about just spending
some more time with the guys

37:44.240 --> 37:47.200
just to see how they think,
how they react to things.

37:47.240 --> 37:51.280
I want to get more
confident in them as
commercial business people.

37:58.520 --> 38:00.880
[narrator] Now, it's
The Cheese Wheel's turn.

38:00.920 --> 38:04.360
Graham's looking for
a £500,000 investment.

38:05.880 --> 38:07.760
[Jeremy]
He's very competent
in the kitchen,

38:07.800 --> 38:10.480
but his aspiration is to be CEO
of this business.

38:10.520 --> 38:12.920
So he needs to convince me

38:12.960 --> 38:14.680
that he's capable
of doing that.

38:19.960 --> 38:22.440
-So those dishes that I tried
today, which were fantastic...
-Right.

38:22.480 --> 38:26.080
Have you a feel for what
the gross profit
on those are?

38:26.120 --> 38:32.280
We're looking at a food cost
of around 22 to 24%.
And that's why it's--

38:32.320 --> 38:36.880
I'm just slightly
confused on your
gross profit figure there...

38:36.920 --> 38:40.480
-You mentioned 25% in there?
-Yeah, we'd--

38:40.520 --> 38:43.360
-Your model's talking
about 35%.
-35% food cost?

38:43.400 --> 38:46.120
-Yeah.
-I've got my numbers
wrong because it's--

38:46.160 --> 38:48.720
-What we're operating
is definitely around--
-It's a big difference.

38:48.760 --> 38:53.760
Yeah, it's a major difference,
but maybe my full cost
is not spot-on correct.

38:53.800 --> 38:55.480
But I could tell you
what we're doing now,

38:55.520 --> 38:59.520
and that is, um, we're looking
at 24 to 27%--

38:59.560 --> 39:02.120
Okay, fine.
So that's what
you're doing in Camden.

39:02.160 --> 39:03.840
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Yeah, that makes
a bit of sense.

39:03.880 --> 39:08.600
So going forward,
we're looking at
65% gross profit.

39:08.640 --> 39:12.160
-Okay. It's, uh...
-Which is okay.

39:12.200 --> 39:14.680
-But it's not ideal.
-Yeah, it's not...

39:14.720 --> 39:18.520
The concept is one thing,
but if I'm gonna back him,

39:18.560 --> 39:20.600
then I need to be confident

39:20.640 --> 39:24.000
that he is gonna be able to
make that concept profitable.

39:24.040 --> 39:27.040
You're gonna explain what
this restaurant looks like.

39:27.080 --> 39:29.560
A floating sort of
kitchen kiosk

39:29.600 --> 39:32.360
with people working in
the middle and people
sitting all around it.

39:32.400 --> 39:34.600
We'd like to try to bring
more wheels in, too,

39:34.640 --> 39:39.040
so we can have more than just
the fettuccine Alfredo
onto the wheel.

39:39.080 --> 39:43.440
We've actually managed
to source another cheese
wheel for tomorrow.

39:43.480 --> 39:45.640
Adding an extra wheel
in for tomorrow's service

39:45.680 --> 39:48.040
is a really good, positive
move that he's made there.

39:48.080 --> 39:49.760
He's recognized
that unique selling-point

39:49.800 --> 39:51.960
is something that he needs
to capitalize upon.

39:52.000 --> 39:55.880
[narrator] Jeremy's got
a view on what his
potential offer could be.

39:55.920 --> 39:59.440
-You're looking for
an investment of £500,000...
-Yeah.

39:59.480 --> 40:01.800
To take you to that
first stage. The conclusion
at the moment

40:01.840 --> 40:03.600
is that it probably is gonna
cost a little bit more.

40:03.640 --> 40:06.880
You're probably
gonna need potentially,
£600,000 or £700,000.

40:06.920 --> 40:08.640
Okay.

40:08.680 --> 40:12.440
So tomorrow, I'm keen to see
how the second wheel can help

40:12.480 --> 40:14.240
that interaction
with the customer,

40:14.280 --> 40:16.480
because I think,
one is a little bit limiting.

40:16.520 --> 40:20.320
I'm keen to see if the team
can cope with those dishes.

40:20.360 --> 40:21.720
And also, I think,

40:21.760 --> 40:24.920
I'm keen to see some of
the reaction from customers.

40:24.960 --> 40:26.920
-Good.
-I'm still feeling nervous.

40:26.960 --> 40:29.720
-Have a lovely evening.
Nice to see you.
-Cheers. Bye-bye.

40:29.760 --> 40:31.680
[Graham] Jeremy's not
giving anything away,

40:31.720 --> 40:35.760
so definitely not walking
out feeling confident,
but definitely not walking out

40:35.800 --> 40:39.280
feeling like it's over.
So it's, yeah,
on the fence.

40:49.800 --> 40:54.200
Hollings and Cheese Wheel
are in with a chance of
a life-changing investment.

40:54.240 --> 40:57.440
But the investors have serious
questions about both ideas.

40:57.480 --> 40:59.560
Need to rock 'n' roll
those arancini faster.

40:59.600 --> 41:01.800
We need to finish that job
like ten minutes ago.

41:01.840 --> 41:06.240
[Fred] Today's final service
for the paying public will be
what makes up their mind.

41:06.280 --> 41:09.080
Right now, everything
hangs in the balance.

41:09.120 --> 41:13.080
-First table?
-About half past 12:00.

41:13.120 --> 41:15.480
We've had a good
lunch yesterday,
we've had a good meeting,

41:15.520 --> 41:17.760
and now they want to see
if we can deliver the goods

41:17.800 --> 41:20.960
in a real environment,
so it's crucial
that we're ready.

41:22.760 --> 41:24.240
-Morning, guys.
-[James] Morning.

41:24.280 --> 41:25.640
-[Fred] How are you?
-[James] Yeah, good. Yourself?

41:25.680 --> 41:27.360
-Morning, Fred!
-So, you ready for lunch?

41:27.400 --> 41:29.000
-[both] Yeah.
-Foxed.

41:29.040 --> 41:31.760
Food's gotta be good,
but the operations
also must be perfect.

41:31.800 --> 41:33.720
Hopefully it's gonna be
a great atmosphere today

41:33.760 --> 41:37.080
and everybody'll soak up
the whole Hollings experience.

41:37.120 --> 41:38.960
-Well, good luck.
See you later.
-[Ronnie] Thank you.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.040
-See you later.
-Cheers.

41:45.160 --> 41:47.600
So heavy. 40 kilo.
[laughs]

41:47.640 --> 41:50.720
This is the second cheese
wheel now, so you're gonna
see two up on the pass.

41:50.760 --> 41:53.720
It's gonna look fantastic.
It's the first time for us to
have two at the same time.

41:53.760 --> 41:57.200
Fully booked house,
so it's time for us
to up our game

41:57.240 --> 41:59.880
and have a good service.
Voila!

42:02.920 --> 42:04.640
-How are you, Graham?
-Hi.

42:04.680 --> 42:06.200
-You okay?
-Very well. How are you?

42:06.240 --> 42:08.600
-Good, thank you.
-I see you've got another
cheese wheel here.

42:08.640 --> 42:11.400
-[Graham] Yes, we decided
to put two dishes on.
-Uh-huh.

42:11.440 --> 42:14.840
The mushroom rigatoni
dish on here and the
fettuccine Alfredo on there.

42:14.880 --> 42:17.400
-It's very good you've done
that because this is your USB.
-Yeah.

42:17.440 --> 42:19.920
You know, this is what
Jeremy is looking for.
He wants to see

42:19.960 --> 42:24.040
whether there's a restaurant
idea here that can go around
with that cheese wheel.

42:24.080 --> 42:26.200
-We're hoping he sees
something in it.
-Okay, well look.

42:26.240 --> 42:30.200
-I wish you good luck.
See you later. Thank you.
-Thank you very much. Okay.

42:30.240 --> 42:32.720
Ten minutes before service,
the investors are back in.

42:32.760 --> 42:36.240
I think it's really clear
that we want everyone to have
the same Hollings experience.

42:36.280 --> 42:38.480
-They're all VIP, James.
-[James] All VIP.

42:45.120 --> 42:49.280
-Some nice boiling
water there for us.
-Yeah, it's almost up to ten.

42:49.320 --> 42:54.160
[narrator] Graham and Ronnie
and James are opening to
the public for the last time.

42:54.200 --> 42:56.600
-Afternoon, guys. How are
you doing? You well?
-Hi. Yeah.

42:56.640 --> 42:58.160
-[man] Good. Thank you.
-How are you today?

42:58.200 --> 43:00.120
-Good, yeah.
-Great.

43:00.160 --> 43:03.440
[narrator] Today, the investors
will watch the restaurants
in full service.

43:03.480 --> 43:05.400
-How was that, ladies?
-[woman] Excellent.

43:05.440 --> 43:06.960
-All good?
-[woman] Thank you, thank you.

43:09.080 --> 43:13.000
[narrator] They'll expect
to see a smooth operation
and happy customers.

43:13.040 --> 43:17.080
He wants to move his
product from a successful
street-food business

43:17.120 --> 43:19.360
into something
with wider appeal.

43:19.400 --> 43:22.400
To do that,
he needs to extend that menu.

43:22.440 --> 43:26.680
He's capable of that,
as a chef, without doubt.

43:26.720 --> 43:29.960
What I'll try
and understand today is
how he can translate that

43:30.000 --> 43:33.160
into the cheese wheel,
which is his chosen vehicle.

43:33.200 --> 43:35.960
That connection is where
I'm a little bit concerned,

43:36.000 --> 43:39.040
so it's gonna be
really interesting to see
how that progresses.

43:39.080 --> 43:42.840
Nice fritters, William.
Very nice fritters.

43:42.880 --> 43:44.880
[Atul] It's far
from a done deal,
to be honest.

43:44.920 --> 43:50.040
I'm quite excited from
yesterday's chat and it'll
help me to see them in action.

43:50.080 --> 43:53.400
The quality of
what we consumed
yesterday was super.

43:53.440 --> 43:57.200
The reality now around
seeing them as a team that
we could invest in and develop,

43:57.240 --> 44:00.200
it's lead us to a lot of
deliberation overnight.

44:00.240 --> 44:03.600
Anything is possible.
We're prepared to invest
another two hours of our time

44:03.640 --> 44:06.680
to go and spend
some time with the guys.
We have an open mind.

44:06.720 --> 44:09.960
[narrator] If Atul and Imbiba
both like what they see today,

44:10.000 --> 44:13.640
they will go head-to-head in
a bidding war to sign Hollings.

44:13.680 --> 44:15.840
-Hello.
-Hello, sir. How are you doing?

44:15.880 --> 44:19.200
-You came back!
-One sweet corn,
one focaccia, Will.

44:19.240 --> 44:21.440
We've got some pews at the bar
if you'd like to
jump down, sir?

44:21.480 --> 44:24.040
-I'll take this one.
-Fantastic.

44:24.080 --> 44:26.320
-[waiter] The dish is very hot.
-Thank you.

44:26.360 --> 44:28.600
There's your
sweet-corn tempura.

44:28.640 --> 44:32.520
-Give me one fried oyster
and one portion of lamb.
-Oui, Chef!

44:32.560 --> 44:34.880
-There's certainly a buzz
about the kitchen.
-Definitely.

44:34.920 --> 44:37.000
-So fish 'n' chips and the
venison, have gone, yeah?
-Yeah.

44:37.040 --> 44:39.160
Mmm. Nice.

44:39.200 --> 44:41.280
[James] It's probably best
to pick a couple of snacks

44:41.320 --> 44:44.600
and pick up a couple of
Teeny Tinis and then
just go from there.

44:44.640 --> 44:46.480
-[man] Table two.
-Yes, please. Table two.

44:46.520 --> 44:47.920
-[man] Anything else?
-That's it.

44:51.440 --> 44:53.040
-Two cheese wheels!
-Two cheese wheels today,
yes.

44:53.080 --> 44:55.680
Wow! So, how are you
using the second wheel?

44:55.720 --> 44:58.640
[Graham] We changed our menu
a little bit to adjust
for the new one.

44:58.680 --> 45:00.960
-Okay, good.
-[Graham] We've added on
the mushroom rigatoni.

45:01.000 --> 45:04.200
It's a lovely little dish.
It's gonna be fantastic
on the wheel.

45:04.240 --> 45:05.640
-Great.
-Okay.

45:09.080 --> 45:11.520
-Rigatoni, yeah?
-Rigatoni.

45:11.560 --> 45:14.520
-Okay. Here we go.
I hope you enjoy.
-Lovely. Thank you.

45:26.760 --> 45:28.520
-How are you enjoying it?
-Yeah, it's very good.

45:28.560 --> 45:30.000
Okay. Better
without the brandy?

45:30.040 --> 45:32.920
[Jeremy] Better without
the brandy.
[chuckles]

45:32.960 --> 45:35.280
[Jeremy]
The new dish that Graham
put on in the second wheel

45:35.320 --> 45:37.120
was very, very good actually.

45:37.160 --> 45:39.920
It's certainly good to see
that he's capable of
coming up with solutions.

45:39.960 --> 45:42.360
In the context of
business problem-solving,

45:42.400 --> 45:43.520
that's very important.

45:47.240 --> 45:48.480
Chicken burger.
There you go, sir.

45:48.520 --> 45:49.800
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you.

45:49.840 --> 45:51.960
[waiter] I've got your fries
to go with it.

45:55.680 --> 45:57.520
Delicious. I can't fault it.

45:57.560 --> 45:59.520
-I can't fault it.
It's really good.
-Thank you.

46:02.720 --> 46:04.280
[waitress]
Are you not feeling...
The chicken burger...

46:08.000 --> 46:09.920
[woman] The meat
isn't actually that nice.

46:09.960 --> 46:12.440
It's with thigh meat, isn't it?
Not chicken breast?

46:12.480 --> 46:15.320
[waitress] You're not
enjoying it? Do you want me
to take it away for you?

46:15.360 --> 46:17.080
[woman] Yeah.

46:17.120 --> 46:21.560
Unfortunately, the guys
have just had a meal
returned from the table.

46:21.600 --> 46:25.080
James, do you have
champagne here with you?

46:25.120 --> 46:28.040
-We've got English
bucket wine to sample.
-Can I request four glasses?

46:28.080 --> 46:30.280
-Yes, certainly.
For yourselves?
-On that table.

46:30.320 --> 46:32.040
-Uh, well, in the corner?
-Yeah.

46:32.080 --> 46:34.800
The restaurant is
about hospitality.
It's about generosity.

46:34.840 --> 46:37.440
It's about making people happy
and giving them a good time.

46:37.480 --> 46:39.160
-I'm Atul Kochhar.
-[woman] Hi.

46:39.200 --> 46:42.280
-We've got a difficult,
difficult table over there.
-[laughter]

46:42.320 --> 46:46.240
[Atul] I heard that your food
didn't go well,
so apologies on the house.

46:46.280 --> 46:47.920
-[woman] Oh!
-That's very kind.

46:47.960 --> 46:49.360
-[Atul] And we've got you
a glass of bubbly.
-Thank you very much.

46:49.400 --> 46:50.680
[Ronnie] If chicken thigh
is good enough for my dogs,

46:50.720 --> 46:53.400
it's good enough
for the burger.
[scoffing]

46:53.440 --> 46:55.480
If you do chicken thighs
as a burger,

46:55.520 --> 47:00.040
one in hundred's gonna
come back because
they eat at KFC.

47:00.080 --> 47:02.960
I was a little disappointed,
I think, from the reaction
from both of them.

47:03.000 --> 47:07.320
I would have expected
a little bit more warmth
and that lacked.

47:07.360 --> 47:10.400
If you put it on the menu
that it's made with chicken
thighs, then people can choose.

47:17.280 --> 47:20.000
[Graham] How's the customers?
Everyone enjoying themselves?

47:20.040 --> 47:22.160
-[waiter] Everyone.
-[Graham] Okay, good stuff.

47:22.200 --> 47:24.480
[woman] I don't know.
It's just,
like, typical pasta and cheese.

47:24.520 --> 47:26.680
I don't know if
it's blowing my mind,
but it's nice.

47:26.720 --> 47:29.840
It's something that
I would like to eat on,
like, a winter evening.

47:29.880 --> 47:32.600
It's really nice.
It's starting
to get a bit tamer now,

47:32.640 --> 47:34.640
but that's because
I didn't have any toppings.

47:34.680 --> 47:36.760
Um, and that was my choice.

47:40.480 --> 47:42.440
-All right, Jeremy?
You okay?
-Very well.

47:42.480 --> 47:45.400
-Are you having a good lunch?
-There's some really
good cooking going on here.

47:45.440 --> 47:47.800
Do you think there's a business
based on these cheese wheels?

47:47.840 --> 47:49.760
[Jeremy]
Certainly.
Um, it's very visual,

47:49.800 --> 47:53.920
you see people
smiling as they walk past,
which is always a good sign.

47:53.960 --> 47:59.200
It's just whether
the business translates into
a real restaurant scenario.

47:59.240 --> 48:01.720
-Tough decision
you gotta make, Jeremy.
-It is a tough decision.

48:01.760 --> 48:04.560
-I don't want to be
in your shoes right now.
-[laughing]

48:04.600 --> 48:06.840
There is absolutely no
doubt the guy can cook.

48:07.480 --> 48:09.120
Bye, now.

48:09.160 --> 48:11.920
The Cheese Wheel
can be a very good
visual feature,

48:11.960 --> 48:18.040
but I'm not 100% sure really
yet whether it is enough.

48:18.080 --> 48:20.960
I think the big thinking
I've gotta do this afternoon,

48:21.000 --> 48:24.160
is to understand whether I can
overcome, in my mind,

48:24.200 --> 48:27.040
Graham's slight inexperience

48:27.080 --> 48:30.360
as a businessman
to run that business,

48:30.400 --> 48:32.600
over his ability as a chef.

48:35.760 --> 48:37.880
Cheers, mate.
Thanks very much.
James, great job.

48:37.920 --> 48:39.760
-Thank you. Sure.
-Great job. Thank you
very much. Thank you.

48:42.360 --> 48:45.520
[Atul] I definitely like
the product. I definitely
like the people.

48:45.560 --> 48:48.800
Maybe attitude
could be an issue,
but we can work on it.

48:48.840 --> 48:51.600
-They seemed pretty chuffed,
though.
-Yeah, they ate a lot of food.

48:51.640 --> 48:57.400
Whether I go with full-blown
investment or I do a small
investment on them,

48:57.440 --> 49:02.160
I need to weigh up how
much training I would give them
to run a proper restaurant.

49:02.200 --> 49:05.280
I need to go away
and do my numbers as well.

49:05.320 --> 49:07.560
[James] There was really
good feedback. Lots
of happy faces.

49:07.600 --> 49:10.000
-We've done our bit, so...
-[Ronnie] So now we're waiting.

49:10.040 --> 49:11.280
-Yeah.
-Like beginners.

49:12.760 --> 49:15.000
[Fraser]
For us, if we could
find them an MD

49:15.040 --> 49:17.360
and if we could work with them
on a business plan,
that's a different story.

49:17.400 --> 49:19.240
But on face value today,

49:19.280 --> 49:21.280
their business plan
isn't finished, and they're
not the finished product.

49:21.320 --> 49:23.400
And so that makes it
really conflicted

49:23.440 --> 49:25.600
because we'd like to try
and do something with them.

49:25.640 --> 49:27.920
-Nice one.
-That's it. We're done.

49:27.960 --> 49:29.360
-Fantastic, mate.
-Great.

49:30.480 --> 49:32.280
[narrator]
Lunch is over.

49:32.320 --> 49:34.960
Now the pressure
is on the investors.

49:35.000 --> 49:39.560
They have to decide
whether the idea is
worth their money.

49:39.600 --> 49:42.840
-How was lunch?
-It was really--
It went very smooth for us.

49:42.880 --> 49:45.400
[Fred] Look, well. That's it.
It's the end of
the three days.

49:45.440 --> 49:46.960
But now,
the pressure's on them.

49:47.000 --> 49:48.720
Well, Jeremy Roberts
has a deadline,

49:48.760 --> 49:51.240
he has one hour to come back
and make you an offer.

49:51.280 --> 49:52.760
-If he comes back,
game on.
-Fingers crossed.

49:52.800 --> 49:54.960
If he doesn't come back,
it's game over.

49:55.000 --> 49:56.400
Let's see how it goes.

50:11.840 --> 50:16.520
[narrator] Graham came here
looking for £500,000.

50:16.560 --> 50:20.720
If Jeremy Roberts
doesn't return with an offer
of investment by 6:30,

50:20.760 --> 50:23.240
he'll walk away
with nothing.

50:40.640 --> 50:42.960
Have you ever had a moment
in your life like this where

50:43.000 --> 50:45.880
everything could change
in a space of minutes?

50:45.920 --> 50:47.640
I've never had
this moment in my life.

50:47.680 --> 50:51.000
Never, um,
come to a position

50:51.040 --> 50:54.120
-of competing like this
in anything, you know.
-Hmm.

51:07.480 --> 51:08.840
How does it feel now?

51:08.880 --> 51:11.120
Tried to cook as hard
as we could,

51:11.160 --> 51:12.600
so hopefully it was enough.

51:12.640 --> 51:13.720
Yeah.

51:28.280 --> 51:29.440
-Graham?
-Yeah.

51:29.480 --> 51:31.360
The time is up. I'm sorry.

51:33.000 --> 51:35.160
This means I'm going back
to the drawing board,

51:35.200 --> 51:37.080
putting some more work
into the concept...

51:37.120 --> 51:38.960
-That's the way it goes.
-Yeah.

51:43.840 --> 51:47.760
[Jeremy] Graham's concept,
on a street food level,
is really strong,

51:47.800 --> 51:52.680
but translating that into
a full-service restaurant
based around that...

51:52.720 --> 51:55.280
I think that there's just
not quite enough there.

51:55.320 --> 51:59.520
It's not something that
I can invest in right now.
It's just too much of a risk.

52:00.520 --> 52:02.680
Look, you had a go.

52:02.720 --> 52:05.600
It was really good to see
the food going out,

52:05.640 --> 52:07.680
and happy customers,
feedback was fantastic...

52:07.720 --> 52:10.400
And that's what gives us
inspiration as a team

52:10.440 --> 52:13.440
-if we get our own little
restaurant going, you know?
-Mmm-hmm.

52:13.480 --> 52:15.440
We'll try and grow it
more organically.

52:15.480 --> 52:17.520
I think that might be
more suitable for us.

52:29.520 --> 52:31.200
[narrator]
Now, it's Hollings turn.

52:32.680 --> 52:36.320
James and Ronnie came here
looking for £200,000.

52:39.520 --> 52:42.560
The deadline is eight o'clock.

52:42.600 --> 52:45.600
Will one or more investors
walk through the door?

52:49.320 --> 52:51.160
What's your gut feeling?

52:51.200 --> 52:53.000
I think someone's gonna
walk through the door.

52:53.040 --> 52:54.320
-[Fred] You think?
-Yeah.

52:58.240 --> 53:01.200
What's it like to be
so close?

53:01.240 --> 53:03.720
It's like sitting outside
the chef's office for
my first interview.

53:03.760 --> 53:06.600
-[both chuckle]
-I was 16.

53:06.640 --> 53:10.520
I mean, yeah.
Yeah, he made me wait,
and all.

53:25.040 --> 53:26.960
Five minutes.

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
-[James] Five minutes.
-Oh, well.

53:29.040 --> 53:30.600
-It's ticking on.
-Oh, well.

53:48.560 --> 53:49.720
-Hi, guys.
-[Fred] Atul.

53:49.760 --> 53:52.200
You are sitting dry
inside, nice and warm.

53:52.240 --> 53:53.760
-Nice to see you.
-How are you?

53:53.800 --> 53:55.200
-Nice to see you.
-Grab a chair.

53:55.240 --> 53:56.600
-Pick a seat.
-Thank you.

53:57.800 --> 53:59.120
[clears throat]

53:59.160 --> 54:01.560
So, you've come here
to make an offer?

54:01.600 --> 54:03.480
Out of courtesy for
the second investor,

54:03.520 --> 54:05.840
we'll have to wait a second
until the time is up.

54:07.840 --> 54:12.160
[narrator] Imbiba have
one minute left to walk
through the door with an offer.

54:28.920 --> 54:30.800
Gentlemen, the time is up.

54:32.960 --> 54:35.200
[Darrel] There's something
special in Hollings.

54:35.240 --> 54:38.640
That said, Hollings' business
isn't ready for investment.

54:38.680 --> 54:41.440
It would be remiss
and negligent of us
to look to invest

54:41.480 --> 54:45.760
at a point where
the business simply
isn't ready for investment.

54:45.800 --> 54:48.760
So guys, let me start by
saying, it's been a pleasure
meeting you both.

54:48.800 --> 54:50.040
-[James] Thank you.
-Thank you.

54:50.080 --> 54:52.160
-I do have an offer to make.
-[Ronnie] Okay.

54:52.200 --> 54:54.800
[Atul] I could get
your restaurant, Hollings,

54:54.840 --> 54:57.640
in exactly the locations
you wanted,

54:57.680 --> 55:00.280
up and running,
within a few months.

55:00.320 --> 55:02.960
-Yeah.
-[Atul] I'm working with
a hotel chain

55:03.000 --> 55:06.440
and it will need an investment
of about £200,000

55:06.480 --> 55:08.720
-Mmm-hmm.
-[Atul]
It'll be your Hollings...

55:08.760 --> 55:10.640
-You have to drive it.
-Yeah.

55:10.680 --> 55:13.200
[Atul] I will only be
the pillion rider.

55:14.640 --> 55:17.440
But more than money,
I need your commitment.

55:17.480 --> 55:19.040
Yeah.

55:19.080 --> 55:22.800
If we make one
successful, we can really
roll out this concept.

55:22.840 --> 55:24.520
Who knows, you know,
ten years down the line,

55:24.560 --> 55:26.400
you could be sitting
on your 10, 12 Hollings.

55:26.440 --> 55:28.520
You know what I'm saying?
Okay, we did a good deal here.

55:32.440 --> 55:35.280
Um, it'll probably be remiss
of us not to confer.

55:35.320 --> 55:38.320
-Would that be okay?
-Yeah, absolutely.

55:38.360 --> 55:42.440
[narrator] Atul's new offer
is to set Hollings up as
a flagship hotel restaurant

55:42.480 --> 55:44.960
and then roll it out
on the high street.

55:48.000 --> 55:50.200
[indistinct conversation]

55:53.080 --> 55:54.880
[exhaling]

55:54.920 --> 55:58.800
I don't know.
And the fact I don't know,
something's that's nagging me.

56:01.440 --> 56:04.880
If it's gonna work,
we can't have that.

56:04.920 --> 56:07.640
That's my problem.
That's my problem.

56:07.680 --> 56:09.920
-So...
-I'm not overly excited.

56:09.960 --> 56:12.920
He wants 100%

56:12.960 --> 56:14.440
on this project.

56:14.480 --> 56:17.360
-Yeah.
-I've got 100% commitment to it
and passion to it,

56:17.400 --> 56:19.400
it doesn't mean I need to be
there six days a week,

56:19.440 --> 56:21.360
doesn't mean you need to be
there six days a week.

56:22.200 --> 56:23.640
And I think he wants blood.

56:23.680 --> 56:26.840
Hmm.
[exhales]

56:27.680 --> 56:28.680
Hotel?

56:28.720 --> 56:30.560
-Mmm-hmm.
-I'm against that.

56:30.600 --> 56:32.960
[indistinct]

56:33.000 --> 56:35.080
We'd be naive not to explore
a little bit more.

56:42.800 --> 56:45.360
-[Ronnie] Sorry to keep you.
-Yeah, thank you
for your patience.

56:45.400 --> 56:47.440
-[Atul] No problem.
-[Ronnie] It's obviously...

56:47.480 --> 56:49.600
Obviously a big decision
and we need to make sure

56:49.640 --> 56:52.640
that we get it right for
all parties concerned.

56:57.840 --> 57:00.120
Our gut feeling...

57:00.160 --> 57:02.800
Is that
I think we'd probably,

57:02.840 --> 57:05.120
somewhere along the line,
I think that we might fall out.

57:05.160 --> 57:08.760
-We don't what to set out on--
-What's scaring you
that we'll fall out?

57:08.800 --> 57:11.400
[Ronnie] I'm not scared
by any stretch of
the imagination, but...

57:11.440 --> 57:14.320
It's very difficult
to describe.

57:14.360 --> 57:17.200
We just don't quite
have the right...

57:19.000 --> 57:20.720
-Feel for it.
-I understand.

57:20.760 --> 57:23.680
And I think it would be
unfair for us to get into
an agreement...

57:24.280 --> 57:26.440
With that,

57:26.480 --> 57:29.280
you know,
nagging against us.

57:29.320 --> 57:32.120
[Atul] If you already
don't have a gut feel,
don't go into it.

57:32.160 --> 57:33.840
-It's fine by me.
-[James] That's appreciated.

57:33.880 --> 57:35.480
-Honored to have
eaten your food.
-[Ronnie] Pleasure to meet you.

57:35.520 --> 57:37.040
[James] Pleasure having you
in our restaurant.

57:37.080 --> 57:39.440
Good luck. Have
an exciting journey.
See you soon.

57:39.480 --> 57:40.640
-[James] Bye.
-[Ronnie]
Take care. Thank you.

57:46.160 --> 57:48.760
[Atul] Actually, I'm quite
stunned. I don't know
what happened there.

57:48.800 --> 57:52.640
In their shoes,
anybody would actually
jump at this offer.

57:52.680 --> 57:55.800
I would want to work
with me and I'm giving
them their restaurant.

57:55.840 --> 57:59.480
But if it was
a commitment issue,
then I'm actually very happy

57:59.520 --> 58:03.600
that they declined it now,
than me running after them

58:03.640 --> 58:06.960
and screaming after them
that you guys are not
focusing on the business.

58:07.000 --> 58:11.280
-He had £200,000
on the table...
-Yeah.

58:11.320 --> 58:13.760
-To set you up
for your first Hollings...
-Yeah.

58:13.800 --> 58:17.080
And he was talking
about 10 years down
the line with 10, 12 Hollings.

58:17.120 --> 58:18.840
-Yeah.
-What's wrong with that?

58:18.880 --> 58:21.720
There was just some
sort of nagging thing
in the back of our minds.

58:23.520 --> 58:25.280
Good call. Well done.

58:25.320 --> 58:27.400
-Right decision.
Definitely.
-Yeah.

58:27.440 --> 58:29.360
Yeah, it was really
flattering, obviously...

58:29.400 --> 58:33.360
Respected restaurateur,
and if he's interested in
Hollings, that's fantastic.

58:33.400 --> 58:37.560
-That's massive! Massive deal!
-Yeah, but you've
gotta trust your gut.

58:37.600 --> 58:39.760
-[James] Fancy a pint?
-[Ronnie] Yes, very much so.

58:39.800 --> 58:41.360
[chuckling]

58:43.480 --> 58:46.640
This is the red curry
with tofu and butternut squash.

58:46.680 --> 58:48.760
-[woman] Yeah.
-Tofu, generally...

58:48.800 --> 58:50.520
-[woman] You don't like...
-Pretty bland.

58:51.920 --> 58:54.880
This is worse than
the actual kitchen
at home.

58:54.920 --> 58:57.840
We've got a new set
of servers coming in
in 20 minutes,

58:57.880 --> 59:00.160
which means
that every single dinner
in this restaurant

59:00.200 --> 59:02.480
-has to be out
in 20 minutes.
-[laughs]
