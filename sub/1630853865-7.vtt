[foreboding music playing]

24:52.073 --> 24:54.826
Okay, screw the key. We gotta go.

24:56.036 --> 24:57.287
Without the key?

24:57.370 --> 25:00.457
He's dying.
We don't wanna be stuck in here.

25:00.540 --> 25:02.209
Why, I said nothing.

25:02.292 --> 25:05.212
[student] Mum then, no more. Proceed.

25:07.005 --> 25:10.175
[young Gordie] Tomorrow,
and tomorrow, and tomorrow…

25:10.258 --> 25:12.385
-This is different.
-What is this?

25:12.469 --> 25:15.514
…from day to day, to the last syllable…

25:15.597 --> 25:17.641
[pants] Let's go.

25:17.724 --> 25:21.520
[young Gordie] …our yesterdays
have lighted fools the way to dusty death…

25:21.603 --> 25:24.022
You've got them all over your face.

25:24.105 --> 25:25.565
Are they good, Gordie?

25:25.649 --> 25:26.483
The best!

25:28.527 --> 25:30.362
Life is but a walking shadow…

25:30.445 --> 25:31.279
[Ellie] Wait!

25:31.363 --> 25:32.989
[young Gordie] …a poor player, who struts…

25:33.073 --> 25:34.366
We were just here.

25:35.075 --> 25:37.160
[young Gordie] …and then is heard no more.

25:37.244 --> 25:38.745
[old groovy music playing]

25:38.828 --> 25:40.455
[young Gordie] I didn't mean to upset you.

25:42.791 --> 25:44.251
I didn't mean to upset you.

25:44.334 --> 25:46.002
How long have you known?

25:46.086 --> 25:47.337
How long have you known?

25:47.921 --> 25:49.381
A while, I think.

25:49.464 --> 25:51.007
A while, I think.

25:51.675 --> 25:53.843
You should have told me. [echoing]

25:53.927 --> 25:55.554
[young Gordie] You're not listening to me.

25:55.637 --> 25:57.180
[Gordie's mom] It's just a phase.

25:57.264 --> 25:58.848
[girlfriend] You should have told me.

25:58.932 --> 26:00.809
I'm not talking about this.

26:00.892 --> 26:02.644
I'm not talking about this.

26:02.727 --> 26:04.896
Fine. Okay.

26:05.730 --> 26:08.984
[young Gordie] …who struts and frets
his hour upon the stage

26:09.067 --> 26:10.318
and then is heard no more.

26:10.402 --> 26:12.404
["The Trolley Song"
by Judy Garland playing]

26:12.487 --> 26:14.698
[young Gordie] It is a tale
told by an idiot.

26:15.615 --> 26:18.285
Mom, please, if you would just meet him!

26:18.868 --> 26:21.162
Mom, please, if you would just meet him!

What's that?

26:37.929 --> 26:39.931
[whispers continue]

26:40.890 --> 26:41.808
Whispers.

26:43.351 --> 26:45.103
I hear whispers. [pants]

[breathes deeply]

26:59.618 --> 27:01.620
Having trouble finding your way?

27:02.871 --> 27:04.664
The whispers are coming from there.

27:07.417 --> 27:09.461
Go. Talk to him.

27:09.544 --> 27:10.795
I've got a plan.

[piano continues playing]

27:16.509 --> 27:18.511

In my world,

27:21.056 --> 27:25.310
beautiful music can be made
by pulling apart a soul.

27:26.311 --> 27:28.063
So let's end all this.

27:28.563 --> 27:31.066
Mmm, give me the key,

27:31.149 --> 27:33.485
and we can all leave together.

27:33.568 --> 27:34.569
Play games,

27:35.362 --> 27:38.156
you could find out what happens here

27:38.239 --> 27:40.158
when the lights go out for good.

27:40.659 --> 27:43.495
We couldn't find it.
It wasn't where I left it.

grab it, and then you need to go.

27:55.882 --> 27:56.800
What are you doing?

27:56.883 --> 27:57.884
Slowing him down.

27:57.967 --> 28:00.220
-Try going out the front of the theater.
