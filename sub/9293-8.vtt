00:17.367 --> 00:21.234
Congratulations, Tom.
It's an excellent plan.

00:21.300 --> 00:22.667
 <i>It's about time someone</i>
 <i>in this administration</i>

00:22.734 --> 00:23.934
stood up to these people.

00:24.001 --> 00:25.534
Thank you very much,
Mr. Vice President.

00:25.600 --> 00:29.001
The American-Muslim community
is our best

00:29.067 --> 00:32.634
line of defense
against these terrorists.

00:32.700 --> 00:33.667
 <i>Your plan...</i>

00:34.600 --> 00:35.834
would only hinder

00:35.901 --> 00:37.667
the efforts of law enforcement
to stop Fayed.

00:37.734 --> 00:39.067
I remain convinced

00:39.134 --> 00:42.201
that implementing this plan
would be a terrible mistake.

00:42.268 --> 00:44.967
15 minutes ago,
the NSA picked up a conversation

00:45.034 --> 00:45.901
between McCarthy and Fayed.

00:47.534 --> 00:48.967
 <i>McCarthy's found</i>
 <i>another engineer</i>

00:49.034 --> 00:50.734
to arm the four remaining nukes.

00:50.801 --> 00:53.467
CHLOE:
Oh, my God. It's Morris.

00:53.534 --> 00:55.300
JACK:
Morris, it's a setup.

00:55.367 --> 00:57.400
The engineer McCarthy's
looking for-- it's you.
(two gunshots)

00:57.467 --> 00:59.700
Get out of the car or the
next one's in your head.

00:59.767 --> 01:01.967
We're on our way.

01:02.034 --> 01:02.901
We'll be waiting.

01:02.967 --> 01:04.934
With my money?

01:05.001 --> 01:07.234
FAYED:
 <i>You'll get paid as soon</i>
 <i>as I have what I want.</i>

01:07.300 --> 01:09.001
I'm just delivering him.

01:09.067 --> 01:10.600
You'll have to make him
cooperate.

01:10.667 --> 01:12.534
How do I find McCarthy?!

01:13.567 --> 01:14.667
Four cc's!

01:14.734 --> 01:16.367
His vitals are spiking
across the line.

01:16.433 --> 01:17.367
JACK:
Four cc's!

01:17.433 --> 01:18.433
Jack, don't.

01:19.834 --> 01:21.834
 <i>It has nothing</i>
 <i>to do with McCarthy.</i>

01:21.901 --> 01:23.600
It has to do with Palmer.

01:23.667 --> 01:24.934
David Palmer?

01:25.001 --> 01:28.734
I gave the order
for his assassination.

01:28.801 --> 01:30.001
JACK:
 <i>Not only was he responsible</i>

01:30.067 --> 01:31.367
 <i>for David Palmer's</i>
 <i>assassination,</i>

01:31.433 --> 01:33.001
he directed
the entire conspiracy.

01:33.067 --> 01:34.034
He was trying to protect

01:34.101 --> 01:34.867
 <i>my father's company.</i>

01:34.934 --> 01:35.934
Then...

01:36.001 --> 01:37.067
You told them about Palmer.

01:37.134 --> 01:38.534
I had to give
them something,

01:38.600 --> 01:40.734
make them think I cracked,
but I kept you out of it.

01:40.801 --> 01:41.967
Dad, stick
to the plan.

01:43.367 --> 01:44.634
Sometimes you have
to make adjustments.

01:53.834 --> 01:54.967
My son's had a seizure!

01:55.034 --> 01:57.234
PHILLIP:
 <i>If you people killed my son,</i>

01:57.300 --> 01:59.767
you're gonna regret it
for the rest of your life.

02:10.268 --> 02:11.834
Chloe, it's Jack.

02:11.901 --> 02:13.400
I'm en route to the ambush site.

02:13.467 --> 02:15.667
You need to tell me which
direction they took Morris.

02:15.734 --> 02:17.168
I'm bringing
it up now.

02:17.234 --> 02:18.801
Jack, what are they
gonna do to him?

02:18.867 --> 02:20.667
Chloe, they have to keep
him alive long enough

02:20.734 --> 02:22.101
to try and make the
bombs operational.

02:22.168 --> 02:23.634
That means
we've got time.

02:23.700 --> 02:26.268
I need you to remain calm
and pull up the satellite now.

02:26.333 --> 02:28.333
I'm trying;
the server's not responding.

02:28.400 --> 02:29.567
That's 'cause
you're not

02:29.634 --> 02:30.433
re-synching the
coordinates correctly.

02:30.500 --> 02:31.834
I know what I'm doing.

02:37.867 --> 02:40.834
Have you confirmed this
with the field team?

02:40.901 --> 02:42.500
Yes.

02:43.567 --> 02:45.268
Jack's on line 1.

02:56.901 --> 02:58.333
Jack, it's Bill.

02:58.400 --> 03:01.268
We just got word from the field
team at your brother's house.

03:01.333 --> 03:04.268
Graem's dead, Jack.

03:07.333 --> 03:08.667
What happened?

03:08.734 --> 03:10.634
We'll know more
after an autopsy,

03:10.700 --> 03:12.967
but all signs point
to cardiac arrest.

03:13.034 --> 03:15.168
Because of the interrogation.

03:15.234 --> 03:17.700
The medic on site believes
that was a factor.

03:17.767 --> 03:20.001
My father know?

03:20.067 --> 03:21.834
Yes, he was there.

03:21.901 --> 03:23.600
But your sister-in-law
and nephew

03:23.667 --> 03:25.867
were already en route to CTU
when it happened.

03:25.934 --> 03:27.168
Bill, I'd really
appreciate it

03:27.234 --> 03:29.333
if you would be the one
to break the news to her.

03:29.400 --> 03:30.300
Of course, Jack.

03:30.367 --> 03:31.567
Sir.

03:31.634 --> 03:33.867
Stand by.

03:33.934 --> 03:36.168
Chloe's starting to screw up.

03:36.234 --> 03:38.667
She's worried
about Morris.

03:38.734 --> 03:40.700
I think she's
losing it.

03:47.234 --> 03:49.400
Chloe, have you accessed
the uplink yet?

03:49.467 --> 03:51.901
Not yet.

03:51.967 --> 03:53.400
Listen,

03:53.467 --> 03:55.500
I know what you must be feeling,
but if there's a problem...

03:55.567 --> 03:56.934
Get away from me!
There's not a problem!

03:57.001 --> 03:58.534
The only problem is people
like you bothering me

03:58.600 --> 03:59.767
when I'm trying
to do my job.

03:59.834 --> 04:01.534
Chloe, give up
your post to Milo.

04:01.600 --> 04:02.934
Leave me alone; I can do this!

04:03.001 --> 04:04.034
Now.

04:06.333 --> 04:07.734
Fine.

04:12.901 --> 04:14.234
Jack, I've had
to relieve Chloe.

04:14.300 --> 04:15.268
She's too distraught
to function.

04:15.333 --> 04:16.333
You're on with Milo.

04:16.399 --> 04:18.834
Jack, just give
me a second.

04:24.734 --> 04:26.001
Okay, I got McCarthy
on satellite

04:26.067 --> 04:27.767
13 minutes ago,
abducting Morris

04:27.834 --> 04:29.901
in a silver Maserati
at the corner of Central

04:29.967 --> 04:31.367
and Third.

04:31.433 --> 04:33.101
I'm tracking them
to their current position.

04:33.168 --> 04:34.801
All right, right now

04:34.867 --> 04:37.333
McCarthy's at Adams
and 13th, heading west.

04:37.400 --> 04:38.767
Copy that.
We should have a visual

04:38.834 --> 04:40.001
in the next couple minutes.

04:40.067 --> 04:42.101
How long is it gonna
take the TAC teams

04:42.168 --> 04:43.333
to intercept McCarthy
on the ground?

04:43.400 --> 04:45.234
I don't know.
We'll get back to you.

04:49.600 --> 04:52.400
Where are we taking him?

04:52.467 --> 04:54.134
Fayed will call soon.

04:54.201 --> 04:56.001
Just relax. Drive.

04:56.067 --> 04:57.433
I am relaxed.

04:57.500 --> 04:59.934
I just want to get
this over with.

05:00.001 --> 05:01.400
It's never gonna be over.

05:01.467 --> 05:02.767
CTU knows
who you are.

05:02.834 --> 05:03.801
They're already
looking for you.

05:03.867 --> 05:04.801
Shut up.

05:04.867 --> 05:06.001
Is that possible?

05:06.067 --> 05:07.467
Don't listen to him.
He's bluffing.

05:07.534 --> 05:09.067
So you're not Darren McCarthy,

05:09.134 --> 05:11.333
arms dealer,
subcontracted

05:11.400 --> 05:12.801
by BXJ Technologies.

05:12.867 --> 05:14.834
CTU intercepted a transmission

05:14.901 --> 05:16.433
about Fayed hiring
you to do this.

05:16.500 --> 05:17.400
I said shut up!

05:17.467 --> 05:18.734
Right.

05:18.801 --> 05:21.268
We're handing him over
to Fayed as planned.

05:21.333 --> 05:23.767
If I'm already
a marked man,

05:23.834 --> 05:25.201
might as well get paid for it.

05:25.268 --> 05:26.367
What about me?

05:26.433 --> 05:27.967
He didn't say
they know about you.

05:29.400 --> 05:32.201
And anyway, I'll take care
of you, like always.

05:32.268 --> 05:33.901
(helicopter whirring overhead)

05:33.967 --> 05:36.001
Chopper?

05:36.067 --> 05:37.168
That's a chopper.

05:43.067 --> 05:44.268
I got him. I got him.

05:44.333 --> 05:45.300
We got a visual.

05:46.734 --> 05:48.201
Turn left.

05:48.268 --> 05:49.567
But why...
Just do what I say!

05:49.634 --> 05:50.500
Just do it!

05:58.067 --> 06:00.168
Swing back.

06:00.234 --> 06:01.534
JACK:
They just took off.

06:01.600 --> 06:02.734
They must have spotted us.

06:02.801 --> 06:04.067
All right, I got them
turning north

06:04.134 --> 06:05.967
onto Anders.

06:18.734 --> 06:20.067
Go around them.

06:20.134 --> 06:20.967
I, uh...

06:21.034 --> 06:22.001
Go around them!
What?!

06:22.067 --> 06:23.400
Just do it!
No!

06:28.268 --> 06:28.834
Oh, my God.

06:45.834 --> 06:47.268
Are they still there?
Yes.

06:48.967 --> 06:50.201
Turn there!

06:57.367 --> 06:58.600
We got a problem up here.

06:58.667 --> 07:00.234
They're headed
to the 110 interchange.

07:09.600 --> 07:11.134
Damn it. We just lost them.

07:11.201 --> 07:13.201
Does CalTrans have any cameras
that are covering that area?

07:13.268 --> 07:15.101
No.

07:15.168 --> 07:16.967
Nothing.

07:17.034 --> 07:18.234
TAC team is still
five minutes away.

07:18.300 --> 07:20.134
Captain, I want you
to put me down now.

07:35.400 --> 07:37.367
Do you know
what this is about?

07:40.634 --> 07:43.234
Fayed, the man
you're taking me to,

07:43.300 --> 07:46.867
is the terrorist who set off
the nuclear bomb in Valencia.

07:46.934 --> 07:49.134
He has four more bombs.

07:49.201 --> 07:51.001
But he needs me
to make them work,

07:51.067 --> 07:54.867
so that he can kill tens of
thousands of innocent people.

07:54.934 --> 07:58.400
And all you have to do
to stop that from happening

07:58.467 --> 08:00.268
is to uncuff me.

08:00.333 --> 08:02.767
McCarthy's right.

08:02.834 --> 08:05.367
CTU doesn't know you exist.

08:05.433 --> 08:08.767
For the love of God,

08:08.834 --> 08:11.700
all of those people's
lives are on you.

08:45.067 --> 08:46.734
Let's go.

08:53.500 --> 08:54.634
Shouldn't I get my luggage?

08:54.700 --> 08:56.067
Forget about the luggage!
Come on!

09:04.134 --> 09:06.834
You did not tell me

09:06.901 --> 09:10.001
this is about nuclear bombs.

09:10.067 --> 09:13.268
What this is about
is about $7 million.

09:13.333 --> 09:14.834
Now, get in the truck!

09:44.500 --> 09:46.433
MILO:
Pressman.

09:46.500 --> 09:47.567
They dumped the car.

09:47.634 --> 09:48.867
They must have
switched vehicles.

09:48.934 --> 09:50.234
From the underpass,
they could've merged

09:50.300 --> 09:52.600
directly onto any one of
six local roads or highways.

09:52.667 --> 09:53.867
There's no way
of tracking them

09:53.934 --> 09:55.433
without knowing exactly
what vehicle they're in.

09:55.500 --> 09:57.667
Damn it, Milo.
They could be anywhere!

09:57.734 --> 09:58.901
The TAC team's here.

09:58.967 --> 09:59.934
Get back to me.

10:04.534 --> 10:07.067
Head south.

10:09.967 --> 10:12.333
I'm sorry.

10:22.433 --> 10:23.834
Hello.

10:23.901 --> 10:25.867
I have a new place
for us to meet.

10:25.934 --> 10:27.268
Are you certain
you're not being followed?

10:27.333 --> 10:28.333
Yeah.

10:28.400 --> 10:29.433
What's the address?

10:29.500 --> 10:32.134
4332 Florence Avenue,

10:32.201 --> 10:34.867
apartment 621.

10:34.934 --> 10:36.433
Have you got
my money?

10:36.500 --> 10:38.201
Yes.

10:42.734 --> 10:44.433
Turn on the GPS.

10:52.934 --> 10:54.634
Apartment 621.

10:54.700 --> 10:56.967
All right?
Don't forget it.

11:03.433 --> 11:04.634
Okay, good.

11:04.700 --> 11:05.667
It's not too far.

11:23.268 --> 11:24.201
Yes, yes.

11:24.268 --> 11:25.333
Thank God.

11:25.400 --> 11:26.400
A bit excessive,

11:26.467 --> 11:28.567
but you did
the right thing.

11:28.634 --> 11:30.867
Now I've got to contact CTU
and give them...
Shut up!

11:30.934 --> 11:32.867
Shut up!

11:33.934 --> 11:36.667
Fayed wants you alive,

11:36.734 --> 11:40.667
and whatever shape you're in
beyond that is up to you.

11:40.734 --> 11:43.767
Oh, come on. What are you doing?

11:43.834 --> 11:48.268
I am making $7 million.

11:48.333 --> 11:52.201
And I can spend it without
having to worry about CTU.

12:11.567 --> 12:13.367
--Listen...

12:13.434 --> 12:14.901
I know you think I'm wrong,

12:14.968 --> 12:18.200
and that I blindsided you
by not backing your proposals.

12:18.267 --> 12:20.267
Correct on both counts, sir.

12:20.334 --> 12:25.267
Tom, I have always
valued your counsel.

12:25.334 --> 12:30.567
Ever since you showed up at my
home and convinced me to run,

12:30.634 --> 12:32.000
spearheaded my campaign.

12:32.067 --> 12:36.968
I mean, if it weren't for
you, I wouldn't be here.

12:37.033 --> 12:39.567
But I do hope I can
still count on you

12:39.634 --> 12:41.567
to help me implement
my polices.

12:41.634 --> 12:43.567
AGENT DAN:
Excuse me, Mr. President.

12:43.634 --> 12:45.801
The plane carrying
Hamri Al-Assad

12:45.868 --> 12:47.234
has landed at Andrews
Air Force Base.

12:47.300 --> 12:48.834
He'll be here soon.

12:48.901 --> 12:50.100
Thank you.

12:51.167 --> 12:52.901
We'll talk later.

13:14.367 --> 13:16.267
(knocking)
Mr. Lennox?

13:16.334 --> 13:17.701
Uh...

13:17.767 --> 13:19.734
Everything's okay.
We're fine in here. Thank you.

13:19.801 --> 13:21.901
What happened?

13:21.968 --> 13:25.167
The President
just rejected <i>every one</i>

13:25.234 --> 13:27.734
of my proposals <i>right there</i>
in front of the Cabinet.

13:27.801 --> 13:31.634
Not only has he changed his mind
on the internment plan,

13:31.701 --> 13:34.400
he is rolling back
on the detention facilities

13:34.467 --> 13:36.133
that are already in place.

13:36.200 --> 13:37.868
I thought... I thought
he was on board.

13:37.934 --> 13:39.100
Well, so did I.

13:39.167 --> 13:41.300
Now he's putting forth
his own agenda

13:41.367 --> 13:44.133
to try and appease
the Muslim population.

13:44.200 --> 13:45.534
Is he hoping that they're
going to cooperate

13:45.601 --> 13:46.834
and help find the
nuclear weapons?

13:46.901 --> 13:49.334
That's it! That's it!

13:49.400 --> 13:52.300
And all he will succeed in doing
is to prove to the terrorists

13:52.367 --> 13:54.234
that he does not have
the stomach

13:54.300 --> 13:56.834
to do what is necessary
and inevitable.

13:56.901 --> 14:00.901
Okay. Then you need to use your
influence to change his mind.

14:00.968 --> 14:02.868
My...?

14:02.934 --> 14:05.167
My influence?

14:05.234 --> 14:07.334
You don't get it, do you, Reed?

14:07.400 --> 14:09.734
I have no influence.

14:09.801 --> 14:11.501
Not here.

14:11.567 --> 14:14.400
Not in this administration.

14:16.067 --> 14:18.734
No, I'm resigning.

14:18.801 --> 14:21.734
Sir, that would be
a terrible mistake.

14:21.801 --> 14:25.801
My mistake was to believe
that Wayne Palmer

14:25.868 --> 14:27.801
has the courage and the vision

14:27.868 --> 14:29.300
to fill this office.

14:29.367 --> 14:32.300
Clearly, I overestimated him.

14:32.367 --> 14:33.801
He is <i>certainly</i> not his brother.

14:33.868 --> 14:36.434
Which makes it all the more
important that you stay.

14:36.501 --> 14:39.667
Sir, you have the support
of a great many people here,

14:39.734 --> 14:41.801
the least of which
is the Vice President.

14:41.868 --> 14:43.934
Well, unfortunately,
the Vice President

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
is not the one in power.

14:46.067 --> 14:48.934
And this country
is being led to <i>slaughter</i>

14:49.000 --> 14:50.968
by the man who is.

14:51.033 --> 14:52.634
No, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh.

14:52.701 --> 14:56.033
I can't, in good conscience,
be party to this. I can't.

14:56.100 --> 14:57.968
Sir, sir, this is
a terrible mistake.

14:58.033 --> 15:00.067
Reed, I cannot talk about this
any further.

15:00.133 --> 15:02.467
Go now and draft
my letter of resignation

15:02.534 --> 15:05.834
and bring it to me now
for me to sign.

15:08.834 --> 15:11.200
Yes, sir.

15:18.701 --> 15:19.868
CARSON:
Yes?

15:19.934 --> 15:21.400
Yeah, it's Reed.

15:21.467 --> 15:23.334
Palmer just shot down the Lennox
plan in the Cabinet meeting.

15:23.400 --> 15:26.601
He's rejecting every one
of the initiatives.

15:26.667 --> 15:28.133
Did you hear what I said?

15:28.200 --> 15:29.234
I heard.

15:29.300 --> 15:30.667
Looks like we have no choice.

15:30.734 --> 15:32.267
We'll have to move ahead
with what we all talked about.

15:34.067 --> 15:36.434
I realize it's extreme,
but under the circumstances,

15:36.501 --> 15:38.868
I don't see any alternative.
Do you?

15:38.934 --> 15:40.467
No. But there's a problem.

15:40.534 --> 15:42.434
Tom Lennox is resigning.

15:42.501 --> 15:44.000
When?

15:44.067 --> 15:45.868
As soon as I write
his letter of resignation.

15:45.934 --> 15:48.868
Carson, if he goes,
I lose my job.

15:48.934 --> 15:50.534
And I lose my access.

15:50.601 --> 15:53.067
Our plan is contingent on your
proximity to the President.

15:53.133 --> 15:54.734
We need you in place.

15:54.801 --> 15:56.801
I know, I am very
well aware of that,

15:56.868 --> 15:59.534
but Tom Lennox is
determined to quit.

15:59.601 --> 16:01.634
He might reconsider
if he knew what was coming.

16:01.701 --> 16:03.968
I suppose I could
feel him out.

16:04.033 --> 16:06.100
Then do it, carefully.

16:06.167 --> 16:08.734
We have to protect ourselves.

16:15.501 --> 16:18.234
Has anything turned up
on CalTrans?

16:18.300 --> 16:20.467
Without knowing what vehicle
McCarthy switched in to,

16:20.534 --> 16:23.300
it's going to take hours
to scan through frame grabs.

16:23.367 --> 16:27.067
Stay on it. Right now,
it's all we've got.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.901
Mrs. Bauer.
Yes?

16:30.968 --> 16:32.801
I'm Bill Buchanan,
Director of Operations.

16:32.868 --> 16:35.601
You must be Josh.

16:37.334 --> 16:39.501
May I speak with you a moment?

16:39.567 --> 16:41.000
Privately.

16:41.067 --> 16:43.767
Um...
It's okay, Mom.

16:43.834 --> 16:45.801
Okay.

16:57.400 --> 16:58.601
What is it?

16:58.667 --> 17:01.534
I'm very sorry
to have to tell you.

17:01.601 --> 17:04.434
Your husband is dead.

17:06.501 --> 17:08.434
How?

17:08.501 --> 17:11.200
He appears to have suffered
a heart attack.

17:11.267 --> 17:13.834
What did Jack do to him?

17:13.901 --> 17:16.800
I assure you there'll be
a thorough investigation.

17:16.867 --> 17:18.834
Your father-in-law is
accompanying Graem's body here

17:18.901 --> 17:20.367
for an autopsy.

17:20.434 --> 17:22.300
Unless you have an objection.

17:22.367 --> 17:23.934
No.

17:29.734 --> 17:31.400
I have to tell my son.

17:31.467 --> 17:33.033
Of course.

17:38.434 --> 17:40.968
Josh.

17:41.033 --> 17:44.534
Your mother wants
to speak with you.

17:53.968 --> 17:56.367
MARILYN:
He had a heart attack.

17:56.434 --> 17:57.634
He died.

17:57.701 --> 17:59.667
JOSH:
What? No.

17:59.734 --> 18:01.033
Pressman.

18:01.100 --> 18:03.100
It's Jack.
Let me speak to Buchanan.

18:03.167 --> 18:05.067
Hold on.
Sir... Jack's on the line.

18:07.667 --> 18:09.067
Jack?

18:09.133 --> 18:11.033
Bill, we found McCarthy's body

18:11.100 --> 18:13.133
less than three blocks away
from the interchange.

18:13.200 --> 18:15.901
We intercepted a call from LAPD.

18:15.968 --> 18:17.801
The witness said
the shooter was a female,

18:17.868 --> 18:19.701
drove off with a male
fitting Morris's description

18:19.767 --> 18:21.000
in a silver pickup.

18:21.067 --> 18:22.601
Did the witness get
a license plate?

18:22.667 --> 18:25.501
No. But McCarthy
received a call

18:25.567 --> 18:27.734
just about five minutes ago.

18:27.801 --> 18:29.300
The caller ID is blocked.

18:29.367 --> 18:31.434
I need you to trace
the source of the call.

18:31.501 --> 18:33.534
You think the call
came from Fayed?
Yeah.

18:33.601 --> 18:36.100
I'll give it to Milo as soon
as you upload the phone's data.

18:36.167 --> 18:37.634
It's on its way.

18:44.300 --> 18:46.367
Knock.

18:50.667 --> 18:52.067
MAN:
What do you want?

18:52.133 --> 18:54.300
I'm Darren McCarthy's associate.

18:54.367 --> 18:55.567
I've got your package.

19:17.400 --> 19:18.901
Who are you?

19:18.968 --> 19:21.434
Where's McCarthy?

19:21.501 --> 19:22.934
He's waiting to
hear from me.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.167
If he doesn't
get the money,

19:24.234 --> 19:25.334
he gives you up.

19:25.400 --> 19:26.968
This is the engineer?

19:27.033 --> 19:30.267
Look, this... I don't know
what you're talking about.

19:30.334 --> 19:31.734
I-I'm just a data analyst.

19:31.801 --> 19:32.801
You've got the wrong man.

19:40.133 --> 19:42.000
Look...

19:42.067 --> 19:45.801
I've brought you
what you want.

19:45.868 --> 19:48.033
Just give me the money,
and I'll go.

19:48.100 --> 19:51.834
You'll get your money when
this man completes his task.

19:56.100 --> 19:58.167
You work at CTU,

19:58.234 --> 20:01.734
so you know I have four nuclear
suitcase bombs in my possession.

20:01.801 --> 20:04.634
You may also know these bombs
need to be reprogrammed

20:04.701 --> 20:06.133
before I can use them.

20:06.200 --> 20:09.634
You are here to create a device
that will allow me to do so.

20:11.901 --> 20:14.501
(quivering):
Well, not bloody likely, mate.

20:29.334 --> 20:32.400
You're going to modify this

20:32.467 --> 20:35.567
so that I can use it
to reprogram the bombs.

20:37.634 --> 20:39.901
(inhales deeply):
No, I'm not.

21:07.033 --> 21:09.601
--Bill, what's happening
with the phone trace?

21:09.667 --> 21:11.768
BUCHANAN:
Milo's still
working on it, Jack.

21:11.834 --> 21:13.200
What is it taking so long?

21:13.267 --> 21:15.000
Checking into it now.

21:17.367 --> 21:19.134
Milo...

21:19.200 --> 21:20.667
what's your status?

21:20.734 --> 21:22.868
All I've got is that the call
was made from a landline.

21:22.933 --> 21:23.967
But the number
was routed through

21:24.033 --> 21:26.267
at least a dozen
different servers,

21:26.334 --> 21:28.300
and they keep cycling
back on each other.

21:28.367 --> 21:29.367
(bangs table):
Come on!

21:29.434 --> 21:30.834
Are you going to be able
to do this?

21:30.900 --> 21:32.401
CHLOE:
Milo.

21:32.467 --> 21:34.467
Let me try.

21:35.567 --> 21:37.100
I know I screwed up earlier.

21:37.167 --> 21:38.801
I wasn't thinking clearly,
but let me try this.

21:38.868 --> 21:40.134
I need to.

21:41.200 --> 21:43.134
All right.

21:43.200 --> 21:47.967
The number strings are
caught in a loop matrix.

21:48.033 --> 21:49.933
CHLOE:
Did you try running a
SatCom overlay filter?

21:50.000 --> 21:52.467
That only works on cell-to-cell
communication.

21:52.534 --> 21:53.933
This call was placed
from a hardline.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.501
NSA recently started using
satellite carrier systems

21:56.567 --> 21:58.801
as a backup for
all phone traffic.

21:58.868 --> 22:01.900
You just have to reconfigure
the embedded decryption program

22:01.967 --> 22:04.100
to... Got it.

22:04.167 --> 22:07.601
That's it.
All right.

22:07.667 --> 22:09.834
McCarthy's call was made
from an apartment building:

22:09.900 --> 22:11.933
4332 Florence Avenue.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.067
Did you copy that, Jack?

22:13.134 --> 22:14.467
Yeah, do we know
which apartment?

22:14.534 --> 22:16.467
No, there's no way to tell;
they tapped directly

22:16.534 --> 22:17.567
into the building's
trunk line.

22:17.634 --> 22:18.801
Our men are ready to move.

22:18.868 --> 22:20.033
Have tactical meet us
over there.

22:20.100 --> 22:21.167
Tell them to set up a perimeter.

22:21.234 --> 22:23.134
Stay out of sight.
Understood.

22:30.667 --> 22:32.567
Good work, Milo.

22:32.634 --> 22:35.134
Sir, it wasn't me.

22:40.367 --> 22:42.567
If you think she's ready,
bring her back in.

22:57.933 --> 22:59.501
Mr. Al-Assad...

22:59.567 --> 23:01.634
right this way.

23:10.667 --> 23:12.267
I've checked out
your background.

23:12.334 --> 23:15.868
And despite my
understandable skepticism,

23:15.933 --> 23:18.067
I do believe you're serious

23:18.134 --> 23:19.434
about wanting
this negotiated peace.

23:19.501 --> 23:21.467
On my own terms, yes.

23:22.900 --> 23:25.134
Let's table your terms
for the time being

23:25.200 --> 23:27.167
while we discuss mine.

23:28.501 --> 23:31.234
My country, sir...

23:31.300 --> 23:34.000
has suffered a nuclear attack
by the very same terrorists

23:34.067 --> 23:35.501
who used to follow you.

23:35.567 --> 23:37.501
Thousands of innocent
Americans are dead

23:37.567 --> 23:39.167
or dying as we speak.

23:39.234 --> 23:42.200
I'm aware of the tragedy
in California, Mr. President.

23:42.267 --> 23:43.634
I was there.

23:43.701 --> 23:45.300
Then you understand,

23:45.367 --> 23:47.467
that if Fayed
successfully detonates

23:47.534 --> 23:49.734
any more nuclear weapons
on US soil,

23:49.801 --> 23:51.834
there will be
no chance whatsoever

23:51.900 --> 23:53.134
for a peace agreement.

23:53.200 --> 23:55.933
The American people
are demanding

23:56.000 --> 23:58.634
that we strike back.

23:58.701 --> 24:01.300
And not just at organizations
such as yours,

24:01.367 --> 24:04.467
but at the governments
that support them.

24:04.534 --> 24:08.167
Now, if just one more nuke
goes off, one more,

24:08.234 --> 24:09.367
we won't have a choice.

24:09.434 --> 24:10.834
You understand me?

24:10.900 --> 24:13.434
We're talking about war.

24:13.501 --> 24:16.534
You don't have to tell me
what is at stake,

24:16.601 --> 24:20.033
but I still don't understand
what you want from me.

24:20.100 --> 24:23.300
I would like you
to appear on television

24:23.367 --> 24:24.967
and make a public address
to the world.

24:25.033 --> 24:27.033
Declare your intentions
for peace,

24:27.100 --> 24:28.434
and appeal to members

24:28.501 --> 24:30.834
of Islamic communities
everywhere to come forward

24:30.900 --> 24:32.601
with any information
regarding Fayed.

24:32.667 --> 24:36.234
You flatter me if you think
I hold sway over all Islam.

24:36.300 --> 24:37.667
No, sir, not all.

24:37.734 --> 24:40.834
Just the extremists who share
your hatred of the West.

24:40.900 --> 24:43.000
I certainly can't reach out
to them for help,

24:43.067 --> 24:44.334
but I know you can.

24:44.401 --> 24:47.634
But perception is everything,
Mr. President.

24:47.701 --> 24:49.334
So I must present my agenda

24:49.401 --> 24:51.067
to my own people
in my own time,

24:51.134 --> 24:53.601
not by appearing on American
television from The White House.

24:53.667 --> 24:56.634
Fayed has already
called me a traitor,

24:56.701 --> 24:58.701
and many others will follow him

24:58.768 --> 25:01.167
if there is even a suspicion
that I am an American puppet.

25:01.234 --> 25:03.033
Not a puppet,
a partner, at least

25:03.100 --> 25:05.167
when it comes to finding
these nuclear weapons.

25:05.234 --> 25:08.167
Now, that's what we have to be
for your peace initiative

25:08.234 --> 25:09.401
to have any chance
of working,

25:09.467 --> 25:11.033
so get used to it!

25:11.100 --> 25:12.801
Now, between you
and me, sir,

25:12.868 --> 25:15.434
I really don't give a damn
how and when you wanted

25:15.501 --> 25:18.801
to present your agenda;
the time is now.

25:20.900 --> 25:24.267
You want to lead
this peace initiative...

25:24.334 --> 25:26.267
then lead.

25:32.033 --> 25:33.100
Who's in command?

25:33.167 --> 25:34.100
Agent Turner.

25:34.167 --> 25:35.300
Agent Turner, what's the status

25:35.367 --> 25:36.667
of your perimeter?
It's in place.

25:36.734 --> 25:38.434
We've got agents
in plainclothes

25:38.501 --> 25:39.734
covering the exits
to the building,

25:39.801 --> 25:41.634
and we have three TAC teams
in position to move in

25:41.701 --> 25:43.000
on your command.

25:43.067 --> 25:44.334
Do you have confirmation
that Fayed's in the building?

25:44.401 --> 25:46.334
Not directly, but
the building manager ID'd

25:46.401 --> 25:48.200
Morris O'Brian entering
the building

25:48.267 --> 25:49.933
with a woman less
than 20 minutes ago.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.334
We assume the woman
is the driver

25:51.401 --> 25:53.234
your witness saw
shoot McCarthy.

25:53.300 --> 25:54.534
There are no cameras
in the building.

25:54.601 --> 25:55.834
We don't know what apartment
or floor they're on.

25:55.900 --> 25:57.834
CTU is patched in
and awaiting your word.

25:57.900 --> 25:59.534
Thank you.

26:04.734 --> 26:06.434
Turn it on.

26:09.567 --> 26:11.267
Bill, it's Jack. Do you copy?

26:11.334 --> 26:12.401
Yes, Jack. Go ahead.

26:12.467 --> 26:13.701
I'm at the staging area.

26:13.768 --> 26:14.734
We have a confirmation

26:14.801 --> 26:16.100
that Morris is
inside the building.

26:16.167 --> 26:18.200
We do not have
confirmation on Fayed.

26:18.267 --> 26:19.634
There are no cameras
in the building.

26:19.701 --> 26:20.734
Do have infrared satellite?

26:20.801 --> 26:22.100
We can't get a live feed,

26:22.167 --> 26:24.033
but we do have a satellite
in position uploading images

26:24.100 --> 26:25.467
at five-minute intervals.

26:25.534 --> 26:28.167
The latest scan shows 215 people
in the building,

26:28.234 --> 26:30.334
spread out over six floors
and 112 apartments.

26:30.401 --> 26:32.601
It's going to take too long
to go room by room.

26:32.667 --> 26:35.067
We're going to have to
figure out another way ID them.

26:37.667 --> 26:40.634
Is this building on the city's
emergency services grid?

26:40.701 --> 26:43.367
Yes, Jack. All buildings over
ten units are required to.

26:43.434 --> 26:46.467
Chloe, it's good
to have you back.

26:46.534 --> 26:47.933
I'm to need you to get
into their system,

26:48.000 --> 26:49.501
and trigger an
all-building fire alarm.

26:49.567 --> 26:51.667
Okay, we just have to get past
their log-in screen.

26:51.734 --> 26:53.367
Let me know
when you're ready.

26:53.434 --> 26:55.467
Agent.

27:21.501 --> 27:23.434
Please...

27:23.501 --> 27:25.467
please, stop.

27:25.534 --> 27:29.100
Just indicate you'll do what
I've asked, and we will stop.

27:36.200 --> 27:38.234
People are leaving the building.

27:38.300 --> 27:39.534
There really is a fire.

27:39.601 --> 27:41.067
What do we do?

27:46.100 --> 27:47.634
There's no fire.

27:47.701 --> 27:49.467
CTU knows we're here.

27:49.534 --> 27:51.601
I really need
to get out of here.

27:51.667 --> 27:53.801
Shut up!

28:00.234 --> 28:02.067
Up against the wall.

28:10.467 --> 28:12.100
Your time is up!

28:36.734 --> 28:39.200
I will use this
all over your body

28:39.267 --> 28:41.234
until you die of
shock or blood loss.

28:41.300 --> 28:44.067
Then I'll just find someone else
to do what I need.

28:44.134 --> 28:47.834
Do you understand?

28:51.601 --> 28:53.534
Look, please...

28:53.601 --> 28:55.534
I don't care about the money.

28:55.601 --> 28:57.868
I made a mistake.

28:57.933 --> 29:00.734
Just let me get out of here.

29:00.801 --> 29:02.834
Please.

29:02.900 --> 29:06.234
So, you give up
the seven million, huh?

29:06.300 --> 29:07.868
Yes.

29:07.933 --> 29:10.834
Okay.

29:11.967 --> 29:13.667
Oh!

29:33.167 --> 29:35.067
Stop... stop!

29:39.634 --> 29:41.868
I'll do it.

30:01.167 --> 30:02.468
--Come in.

30:05.067 --> 30:07.167
This memo says Palmer's
arranging

30:07.234 --> 30:08.934
for Assad to make
a televised statement.

30:09.000 --> 30:10.667
I heard.

30:10.733 --> 30:12.834
Not only are we providing
free airtime

30:12.900 --> 30:15.700
to a mass murderer
and a vowed enemy of democracy,

30:15.767 --> 30:18.568
we are proving terrorism works.

30:23.401 --> 30:25.301
You have my letter
of resignation?

30:25.367 --> 30:27.367
No, sir, I don't.

30:27.434 --> 30:29.201
Why not?

30:29.267 --> 30:31.134
Because you can't resign

30:31.201 --> 30:33.534
while this country is
being brought to the brink

30:33.600 --> 30:37.301
of a nuclear holocaust
by a weak, misguided President.

30:37.367 --> 30:39.633
Damn it, Reed. I explained...

30:39.700 --> 30:43.568
I cannot get the President
to budge on policy.

30:43.633 --> 30:45.000
There's nothing I can do
about this.

30:45.067 --> 30:50.201
What if I told you that
the climate could change?

30:52.267 --> 30:54.134
What does that even mean,
the climate?

30:54.201 --> 30:57.134
Well, I'm just saying that
there are people who believe,

30:57.201 --> 30:59.834
like you, that more

30:59.900 --> 31:02.067
aggressive steps need
to be taken to crack down

31:02.134 --> 31:04.900
on terrorism, both here
at home and abroad,

31:04.967 --> 31:07.334
and that a change in leadership
is imperative

31:07.401 --> 31:09.967
to ensure
this nation's security.

31:13.900 --> 31:15.867
Um...

31:17.067 --> 31:19.201
Who?

31:19.267 --> 31:21.967
Excuse me, sir?

31:22.034 --> 31:24.733
Who are these like-minded people
we're talking about?

31:24.800 --> 31:28.234
I was... I'm just
speaking abstractly.

31:28.301 --> 31:31.034
But you'd have
to agree that, uh...

31:31.101 --> 31:33.234
your plan would have
all the support it needed

31:33.301 --> 31:36.501
if the Vice President were the
man occupying the Oval Office.

31:36.568 --> 31:38.234
Wait...

31:38.301 --> 31:40.034
Now, I may dislike

31:40.101 --> 31:42.034
the President's current course
of action.

31:42.101 --> 31:45.101
I hardly think
it warrants his, his removal.

31:45.167 --> 31:47.767
I'm not talking
about holding hearings.

31:47.834 --> 31:50.000
Something more

31:50.067 --> 31:51.667
immediate would have to happen.

31:58.700 --> 32:01.234
Oh, my God...

32:03.167 --> 32:06.834
You can't possibly be intimating
what I think you are.

32:06.900 --> 32:09.134
I'm not intimating anything.

32:11.101 --> 32:12.967
I'm just simply musing.

32:14.034 --> 32:16.367
Careful.

32:16.434 --> 32:18.867
That kind of musing

32:18.934 --> 32:20.934
can get you thrown
into prison for treason.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.134
Well, I'm sorry, sir,

32:24.201 --> 32:26.733
that you've misunderstood me.

32:26.800 --> 32:29.934
Yeah, I certainly hope so,
for your sake.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.267
All right.

32:32.334 --> 32:34.534
I think you have a letter
to draft for me.

32:47.000 --> 32:48.267
FIREFIGHTER (on bullhorn):
You need to keep

32:48.334 --> 32:50.067
a safe distance
away from the building

32:50.134 --> 32:51.767
until we have determined

32:51.834 --> 32:53.468
there is no danger.

32:53.534 --> 32:56.568
Please move across the street
away from the building.

32:56.633 --> 32:58.767
Anything from your men
on the ground?

32:58.834 --> 33:00.600
They've looked at everyone
who's exited the building.

33:00.667 --> 33:02.767
There's no sign
of Fayed or O'Brian.

33:02.834 --> 33:04.134
If they were inside

33:04.201 --> 33:06.568
when the alarm went off,
they're still in there.

33:06.633 --> 33:08.600
Damn it.

33:08.667 --> 33:11.000
BUCHANAN:
Jack, it's Bill.
Go ahead.

33:11.067 --> 33:12.301
We've got the latest infrared.

33:12.367 --> 33:13.733
We're mirroring it
to your screen.

33:13.800 --> 33:15.167
Hold on.

33:15.234 --> 33:16.867
I've got it.
I'm looking at it now.

33:16.934 --> 33:18.534
Okay, there's three people
left in the apartments

33:18.600 --> 33:20.367
on the second, fourth
and sixth floors.

33:20.434 --> 33:21.600
We need to narrow that down.

33:21.667 --> 33:22.834
Chloe, who's renting
those apartments?

33:22.900 --> 33:24.167
Superimposing building

33:24.234 --> 33:26.034
department schematics
and cross-referencing

33:26.101 --> 33:28.034
with phone company
and police records now.

33:33.867 --> 33:35.201
Okay, the woman on the second
floor is handicapped.

33:35.267 --> 33:37.667
She probably didn't leave
because she can't.

33:37.733 --> 33:39.234
The other two apartments
are occupied

33:39.301 --> 33:41.667
by single males;
the man on the fourth floor
has been arrested

33:41.733 --> 33:43.667
several times
for distribution of narcotics.

33:43.733 --> 33:46.000
Fayed wouldn't use anyone
with a criminal record

33:46.067 --> 33:47.401
to set up a safe house.

33:47.468 --> 33:48.934
Our hostiles are
in the sixth floor apartment.

33:49.000 --> 33:50.600
Get your men ready.
We're moving in.

33:50.667 --> 33:51.834
All right, let's go!

33:57.000 --> 33:58.367
How much longer?

33:58.434 --> 34:01.101
I don't know.

34:01.167 --> 34:02.934
McCarthy said this is
a few minutes' work

34:03.000 --> 34:04.167
for an advanced programmer.

34:04.234 --> 34:06.401
You're stalling for time.
I am not.

34:06.468 --> 34:08.400
It'll be ready
in a minute.

34:09.967 --> 34:11.467
Most everybody seems to have
evacuated the building.

34:11.534 --> 34:13.434
Which is how they intend
to find us.

34:13.501 --> 34:16.967
At this point it's only
a question of time.

34:39.134 --> 34:41.800
Go.

34:44.632 --> 34:45.800
It's done?

34:45.867 --> 34:47.766
Yes.

34:48.833 --> 34:50.101
Bring it.

34:58.867 --> 35:01.700
You have the bombs here?
Just one.

35:01.767 --> 35:04.301
Let's see if you did
your work correctly.

35:08.434 --> 35:10.401
Arm it.

35:11.501 --> 35:12.534
Arm it!

35:23.367 --> 35:25.201
Very good.

35:36.633 --> 35:37.934
Kill him.

35:38.867 --> 35:40.401
Please, I did what

35:40.468 --> 35:42.501
you asked, didn't I?

36:15.633 --> 36:17.967
Now.

36:23.334 --> 36:24.867
All agents sound off!

36:24.934 --> 36:26.267
Clear.

36:27.334 --> 36:29.301
AGENT:
We're clear.

36:30.700 --> 36:32.633
We took a head count
of the bodies.

36:32.700 --> 36:34.700
One hostile's missing;
we haven't found Fayed.

36:45.401 --> 36:46.600
It's clear, sir.

36:50.900 --> 36:52.267
Have your men maintain
the search for Fayed.

36:52.334 --> 36:53.867
I want them to identify
every possible exit

36:53.934 --> 36:55.733
from this apartment.
Yes, sir.

36:55.800 --> 36:58.401
What's his status?
Unconscious, but alive.

36:58.468 --> 36:59.633
Chloe, it's Jack.

36:59.700 --> 37:02.733
Morris has been injured,
but he's alive.

37:02.800 --> 37:04.534
Mr. Bauer, you need to see this.

37:42.633 --> 37:43.867
(into earpiece):
CTU, this is Bauer.

37:54.834 --> 37:57.501
--Jack, be careful.
The bomb has a fail-safe device

37:57.568 --> 37:59.067
that prevents any forced entry.

37:59.134 --> 38:00.834
Through the glass casing I have

38:00.900 --> 38:03.367
two small metal plates slowly
converging on each other.

38:03.434 --> 38:05.434
Those are the trigger plates,
Jack; once they touch

38:05.501 --> 38:07.167
an electrical charge
will detonate the core

38:07.234 --> 38:09.167
causing the nuke to explode.

38:09.234 --> 38:10.367
How far apart are they?

38:10.434 --> 38:13.234
Approximately three inches.

38:13.301 --> 38:15.867
Okay, that gives us
only about three minutes.

38:15.934 --> 38:17.534
There's a small metal box
to the right of it.

38:17.600 --> 38:19.900
You need to carefully
unscrew the top of it.

38:19.967 --> 38:21.067
Copy that.

38:29.301 --> 38:31.434
AGENT TURNER:
Agent Bauer, we know
how Fayed got out.

38:31.501 --> 38:33.468
They opened up a wall
in one of the closets

38:33.534 --> 38:36.067
to get access to the building's
ventilation system.

38:36.134 --> 38:37.267
From there, Fayed could get
to the basement,

38:37.334 --> 38:38.667
and, in turn, the sewer tunnels.

38:38.733 --> 38:40.667
Did you mobilize your teams
and set up a perimeter?

38:40.733 --> 38:42.867
Yes, sir. But we believe
Fayed's already gone.

38:42.934 --> 38:44.867
Witnesses report
a helicopter taking off

38:44.934 --> 38:46.334
from a nearby field
a few minutes ago.

38:46.401 --> 38:48.101
It appeared to be
a medical evac chopper,

38:48.167 --> 38:49.568
so it got through our net.

38:49.633 --> 38:51.101
Damn it.

39:01.401 --> 39:02.501
The top's off.

39:02.568 --> 39:04.000
Come on, Chloe.

39:04.067 --> 39:06.167
We are running out of time.

39:06.234 --> 39:07.934
Okay, under the gears
you should see four wires.

39:08.000 --> 39:10.167
Short-circuit each of them.
That should stop

39:10.234 --> 39:11.434
the left gear from rotating.

39:12.934 --> 39:14.367
You can access the dip switches
underneath it

39:14.434 --> 39:16.501
to open the case and manually
stop the trigger.

39:22.501 --> 39:24.067
Okay, the left gear
stopped moving.

39:24.134 --> 39:26.201
I see the dip switches.
They're all in the up position.

39:26.267 --> 39:27.834
What's next?
Um...

39:27.900 --> 39:30.301
Switch three and four
to the down position.

39:43.834 --> 39:46.834
Nothing happened.
The case didn't open.

39:46.900 --> 39:48.767
It didn't?
That's what I said.
It didn't open.

39:48.834 --> 39:50.501
Hold on.

39:50.568 --> 39:53.267
(bomb buzzing)
Chloe, we are
almost out of time.

39:53.334 --> 39:54.501
Okay, I have an updated

39:54.568 --> 39:55.967
schematic.

39:56.034 --> 39:57.767
It wasn't switches
three and four.

39:57.834 --> 40:00.000
You need to push four and five
to the down position,

40:00.067 --> 40:02.367
and the cover will open.
Are you sure this time?

40:02.434 --> 40:05.367
I'm about as sure as I'm going
to be before this bomb goes off.

40:38.967 --> 40:41.234
It's done.

40:41.301 --> 40:42.667
The bomb is disarmed.

40:51.000 --> 40:52.834
Notify your men the
bomb's been deactivated.

40:52.900 --> 40:55.334
It's over.
MORRIS:
It's not over.

40:55.401 --> 40:57.267
What are you talking about?

40:57.334 --> 41:00.267
The reprogramming device
that Fayed had me build for him.

41:00.334 --> 41:02.201
If it's not here,
it means he took it with him.

41:02.267 --> 41:05.201
And with it,

41:05.267 --> 41:06.867
he can activate
the other bombs he has

41:06.934 --> 41:08.067
anytime he wants.

41:08.134 --> 41:11.234
You gave him something
that worked?

41:11.301 --> 41:12.867
I'm sorry, Jack.

41:12.934 --> 41:15.000
CTU, did you copy that?

41:15.067 --> 41:16.434
BUCHANAN:
We got it, Jack.

41:16.501 --> 41:17.867
Alert the President
immediately.

41:17.934 --> 41:19.767
Organize two teams:
one to search the apartment,

41:19.834 --> 41:21.600
one to search
around the building.

41:21.667 --> 41:23.367
Agent O'Brian will tell you

41:23.434 --> 41:25.034
what you're looking for.
Yes, sir.

41:56.800 --> 41:57.967
Yes, sir.

41:58.034 --> 42:00.401
You see this flash report
in from CTU?

42:00.468 --> 42:01.600
I'm reading it now.

42:01.667 --> 42:03.067
They let Fayed slip

42:03.134 --> 42:05.134
through their fingers... again.

42:05.201 --> 42:07.101
Apparently he now has
the capability

42:07.167 --> 42:10.600
to arm these remaining
suitcase nukes.

42:10.667 --> 42:13.600
This situation is
immeasurably worse.

42:13.667 --> 42:15.534
You know my letter
of resignation?

42:15.600 --> 42:16.967
Have you got that?

42:17.034 --> 42:18.434
Yes, I just, uh...

42:18.501 --> 42:19.934
I just finished
printing it.

42:20.000 --> 42:21.367
I can bring it over
to you right now.

42:21.434 --> 42:22.633
No, no, no.

42:22.700 --> 42:24.167
No, just tear that up.

42:24.234 --> 42:25.834
What?

42:27.101 --> 42:29.767
Um...

42:29.834 --> 42:31.434
That talk we were
having in my office,

42:31.501 --> 42:33.134
I don't think
I misunderstood you.

42:35.034 --> 42:37.067
And I...

42:37.134 --> 42:39.767
would like to discuss
this... further.

42:41.800 --> 42:43.034
Not on this phone.

42:43.101 --> 42:45.900
I'll let you know
when I have a secure location.
