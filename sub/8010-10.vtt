How's the angeling going?

00:04.423 --> 00:06.958
Ah, my human is he easiest gig in town.

00:06.960 --> 00:09.995
Wow, you have a full-blown
case of the dating jitters.

00:09.997 --> 00:12.597
You need to shake off the
rust with a practice guy.

00:12.599 --> 00:13.899
That guy is so not my type.

00:13.901 --> 00:15.701
Seems like a bit of a meathead.

00:15.703 --> 00:17.259
I don't want to be someone's

00:17.284 --> 00:18.537
- practice guy.
- Oh, no.

00:18.539 --> 00:20.172
It turns out he's not the practice guy,

00:20.174 --> 00:21.673
he's the guy I've been practicing for.

00:21.675 --> 00:23.442
I'm just saying, if you
keep getting involved

00:23.444 --> 00:24.876
in your human's life,

00:24.878 --> 00:26.645
it's gonna blow up in your face.

00:26.647 --> 00:28.413
Don't angel an angel, rookie.

00:28.415 --> 00:29.470
You want to go to a barbecue Sunday?

00:29.495 --> 00:30.449
That'd be great.

00:30.451 --> 00:32.517
What's up, John? Seen Lee?

00:32.519 --> 00:35.253
He ended up in Cedars... psych ward.

00:38.225 --> 00:39.991
Thank you so much for coming, Gavin.

00:39.993 --> 00:41.727
I know a family barbecue's

00:41.729 --> 00:43.395
a bit of an intense first date.

00:43.397 --> 00:45.964
Uh, yeah, actually, I've
had this funny feeling

00:45.966 --> 00:48.233
that your brother's
been watching me all night.

00:48.235 --> 00:49.668
Hmm?

00:51.371 --> 00:54.406
(mouthing)

00:55.042 --> 00:56.742
Just ignore him.

00:56.744 --> 00:58.810
Well, um...

00:58.812 --> 01:00.245
thanks for having me.

01:03.884 --> 01:04.849
Okay.

01:04.852 --> 01:06.017
All right.

01:06.019 --> 01:07.419
Hmm.

01:09.289 --> 01:10.622
Look at you.

01:10.624 --> 01:12.057
You go to all the trouble to get a date

01:12.059 --> 01:13.605
with a guy who's clearly not your type,

01:13.607 --> 01:16.061
and then you send him away
with bluer balls than Gonzo.

01:16.063 --> 01:18.230
- You think I should've...
- Walk him to his car,

01:18.232 --> 01:19.564
- you beautiful dumbass.
- Okay.

01:19.566 --> 01:20.799
Don't push me.

01:20.801 --> 01:22.033
Oh, oh!

01:22.035 --> 01:23.935
Close the lid, deprive it of oxygen.

01:24.772 --> 01:26.371
Good thinking!

01:26.373 --> 01:27.973
My last boyfriend was a firefighter,

01:27.975 --> 01:29.274
so he kind of drilled it into me.

01:29.276 --> 01:30.542
A firefighter.

01:30.544 --> 01:32.043
Who drilled things into you.

01:32.045 --> 01:33.211
What kind of firefighter was he?

01:33.213 --> 01:34.579
City? County?

01:34.581 --> 01:35.881
Structural? Aircraft?

01:35.883 --> 01:37.282
Actually, a smoke jumper.

01:37.284 --> 01:39.117
Oh, damn. He's a wildlander.

01:39.119 --> 01:40.418
What fires was he active in?

01:40.420 --> 01:42.120
Stanislaus? Marble Cone? Not Big Bar?

01:42.122 --> 01:43.355
How's work, Brad?

01:43.357 --> 01:44.589
Awesome pivot, Dad.

01:44.591 --> 01:46.024
Uh, work is great.

01:46.026 --> 01:47.392
We're starting an internship program.

01:47.394 --> 01:48.393
I'll be meeting

01:48.395 --> 01:49.327
Randy this week.

01:49.485 --> 01:51.429
I'll be slinging some
wisdom to that young stud

01:51.431 --> 01:53.665
the same way that Big
Ron gave some to me.

01:53.667 --> 01:55.400
R.I.P., bro.

01:55.402 --> 01:57.002
He moved to Tucson.
That's a dead market.

01:57.004 --> 01:59.371
Sounds like Big Ron had
a big influence on you.

01:59.373 --> 02:01.640
He taught me the difference
between a condo and a co-op.

02:01.642 --> 02:02.741
What is the difference?

02:02.743 --> 02:03.875
It's complicated. It's...

02:03.877 --> 02:05.377
There's, like, a lot of, yeah.

02:05.379 --> 02:06.812
And I don't want to make
this a work party, so...

02:06.814 --> 02:09.114
Okay. I'm gonna go get another drink.

02:09.116 --> 02:10.414
That's it? You don't have

02:10.417 --> 02:11.937
any more questions about firefighters?

02:12.586 --> 02:14.085
I take risks, right?

02:14.087 --> 02:15.921
Well, you have those
pants that zip into shorts.

02:15.923 --> 02:17.455
It takes tremendous
courage to wear those.

02:17.457 --> 02:19.825
- All right, we're done here.
- Yeah.

02:21.395 --> 02:23.328
Ah, ah, ah.

02:23.330 --> 02:25.530
Time to dish with your
angel about your good-night kiss.

02:25.532 --> 02:27.165
We didn't kiss.

02:27.167 --> 02:29.201
It wasn't the right moment.
My whole family's here.

02:29.203 --> 02:30.323
Well, don't beat yourself up

02:30.338 --> 02:31.503
- about the non-kiss.
- I'm not.

02:31.505 --> 02:34.539
You're still well within what
we angels call the “woo.”

02:35.642 --> 02:37.409
Oh, did somebody ask
me what the “woo” is?

02:37.411 --> 02:39.744
(chuckles) The “wo”" is an acronym for...

02:39.746 --> 02:41.012
Window of opportunity.

02:41.014 --> 02:42.681
Damn it. Listen.

02:43.584 --> 02:45.116
From what I can tell,

02:45.118 --> 02:46.985
you've got a three-date
window of opportunity

02:46.987 --> 02:48.420
for you and Gavin to kiss.

02:48.422 --> 02:50.488
If you miss that, the romance'll fizzle

02:50.490 --> 02:52.190
and it'll never happen for you two.

02:52.192 --> 02:54.559
Not to worry. We're going
out again Friday night.

02:54.561 --> 02:56.461
Oh. Friday's bad for me.

02:56.463 --> 02:58.763
- Hmm?
- Ah, but I am free...

02:58.765 --> 03:01.433
uh...

03:01.435 --> 03:03.668
oh...

03:03.670 --> 03:05.203
every other day this year.

03:05.205 --> 03:08.006
You do realize you are not invited

03:08.008 --> 03:09.407
on the date with Gavin?

03:09.409 --> 03:11.576
I do now.

03:12.512 --> 03:13.945
Hey, hey, there he is!

03:13.947 --> 03:15.480
My angel in crime.

03:15.482 --> 03:18.116
Oh, man, how was your
stint in the nuthouse, huh?

03:18.118 --> 03:19.484
Horrible. They zapped me,

03:19.486 --> 03:20.785
they counseled me, they washed me.

03:20.787 --> 03:22.020
But it wasn't all bad.

03:22.022 --> 03:23.521
I finished a puzzle.

03:23.523 --> 03:25.257
Oh, wow, that's just awesome
about the puzzle.

03:25.259 --> 03:26.558
You know, I have had

03:26.560 --> 03:28.126
an awesome two weeks myself.

03:28.128 --> 03:31.830
I am making moves that
are blowing my own mind.

03:31.832 --> 03:33.198
- Amy...
- Mm-hmm?

03:33.200 --> 03:35.133
- I'm done angeling.
- Excuse me?

03:35.135 --> 03:36.768
Yeah. I'm no good at this job.

03:36.770 --> 03:38.036
I'm hanging up my halo.

03:38.038 --> 03:40.272
What? That's crazy talk.

03:40.274 --> 03:42.073
Get your head back in the clouds.

03:42.075 --> 03:44.142
- Ow!
- Wow, I'm sorry.

03:44.144 --> 03:45.343
I thought your angel tingle

03:45.345 --> 03:46.378
would tell you that was coming.

03:46.380 --> 03:47.979
No, my tingle's gone.

03:47.981 --> 03:49.748
My instincts are totally shot.

Well, then, how are you
angeling Tricia so well?

03:52.085 --> 03:53.318
I haven't been.

Bangs, Amy.

03:58.759 --> 04:00.325
With that heart-shaped face?

04:00.327 --> 04:01.426
Yeah, it was a total disaster!

04:01.428 --> 04:02.894
Oh...

04:02.896 --> 04:04.629
It got so bad that I started to think

04:04.631 --> 04:06.431
about all the success that
you were having with Allison

04:06.433 --> 04:08.166
since you made yourself visible to her.

Oh, no.

Lee... what did you do?

Fine.

05:40.861 --> 05:43.294
But it's gotta have a bagel setting,

Hey, she's a doctor.

06:12.359 --> 06:14.259
Yep, I got that.

- Oh, you printed it out.
- About this, um,

06:16.596 --> 06:18.163
“ridicky-donk chest bump”

06:18.165 --> 06:19.297
you were gonna teach me...

06:19.299 --> 06:21.566
can you define “ridicky-donk”?

06:21.568 --> 06:22.934
(chuckling): No, I...

06:22.936 --> 06:24.636
we don't have to do the chest bump.

MALE AGENT: Chest bump!

06:26.807 --> 06:28.206
Oh, come on.

06:28.208 --> 06:30.075
I don't want to be treated
any differently.

06:30.077 --> 06:31.676

06:31.678 --> 06:33.878
“the number one rule of real estate,

because we don't
have tiny little male...

06:39.986 --> 06:41.820
- naughty parts.”
- I think we don't leave

06:41.822 --> 06:43.588
a paper trail on
that. We'll just kind of...

06:43.590 --> 06:45.023
Oh!

06:45.025 --> 06:45.757
Ah. (laughs)

06:45.759 --> 06:47.058

06:47.060 --> 06:48.226

her off any minute now.

No. Unfortunately, she's
not that kind of gal.

So they're just gonna have
sex on the front porch?

07:03.844 --> 07:06.377
No, no. Lee, the target
tonight is a first kiss, okay?

07:06.379 --> 07:08.346
Now, can you think of anything

07:08.348 --> 07:10.548
that might encourage that first kiss?

07:10.550 --> 07:12.450
- Oh, I'm so bad at this.
- No, no, no.

07:12.452 --> 07:14.385
I wasn't clear. We just need to think

07:14.387 --> 07:16.721
of something
romantic on the front porch.

07:16.723 --> 07:18.022
Maybe some light

07:18.024 --> 07:19.491
from the sky?

07:19.493 --> 07:20.925
Bats...

07:20.927 --> 07:22.393
on fire.

07:22.395 --> 07:24.562
So, building on that.

07:24.564 --> 07:26.731
How about moonlight, huh?

07:26.733 --> 07:27.899
- Oh, moonlight!
- Yeah!

07:27.901 --> 07:28.867
So much better!

07:28.869 --> 07:30.034
- Yeah!
- Oh, oh!

07:30.036 --> 07:31.102
What if you get up on the roof

07:31.104 --> 07:32.504
and you hold out a branch?

07:32.506 --> 07:35.140
And they are bathed
in dappled moonlight.

07:35.142 --> 07:37.909
The most romantic of all lights.

07:37.911 --> 07:39.644
And that'll lead them directly
to their first kiss.

07:39.646 --> 07:40.879
Oh, that is just genius.

07:40.881 --> 07:42.680
Thanks, man. Come on.

07:42.682 --> 07:43.781
And then the fire bats.

07:43.783 --> 07:45.316
No fire bats, Lee.

07:45.318 --> 07:46.985
Thanks for driving me home.

07:46.987 --> 07:49.220
Thanks for reminding me where you live.

07:49.222 --> 07:51.022
It's the last mistake you'll ever make.

07:51.024 --> 07:52.390
(chuckles) What?

07:52.392 --> 07:53.825
Uh, because you're smart,

07:53.827 --> 07:56.261
and, um, you rarely make mistakes.

07:56.263 --> 07:58.496
I don't want you to think
I'm a murderer or anything.

07:58.498 --> 08:00.665
I didn't until just now.

08:00.667 --> 08:04.502
Oh, wow, look at the
moon coming through that tree.

08:06.406 --> 08:08.039
(owl hooting)

08:11.845 --> 08:14.179
Come on, Sully Sullenburger,

08:14.181 --> 08:15.380
land that love plane.

08:15.382 --> 08:16.648
(shouts)

08:16.650 --> 08:19.450
(grunts, clattering)

08:19.452 --> 08:20.852
Oh, my gosh! Was that a person?

08:20.854 --> 08:23.188
No!

08:29.046 --> 08:31.705
What, did Gavin just
leave with no kiss, again?

08:31.707 --> 08:34.174
Well, it kind of ruined the
moment when a strange man

08:34.176 --> 08:36.743
fell off my roof and
stumbled into the woods.

08:36.745 --> 08:38.244
You wouldn't know
anything about that, would you?

08:38.246 --> 08:39.879
No, I swear.

08:39.881 --> 08:42.082
'Cause he looked a lot like
your business associate Lee.

08:42.083 --> 08:44.250
I don't enjoy being called a liar.

08:44.251 --> 08:45.852
But I will forgive you if you'll let

08:45.854 --> 08:47.420
my business associate Lee stay with me.

08:47.422 --> 08:48.788
He's already back there.

08:48.790 --> 08:50.557
He's banged up pretty good, Allison.

08:50.559 --> 08:51.624
Well, it doesn't matter.

08:51.626 --> 08:52.826
It was a weird date anyway.

08:52.828 --> 08:54.260
It was very intense.

08:56.365 --> 08:58.531
Oh.

09:00.569 --> 09:02.502
(muttering)

09:02.504 --> 09:04.137
I am tired and sweaty.

09:04.139 --> 09:06.706
And I smell like the
old tire we were flipping

09:06.708 --> 09:09.042
over and over and over and over again.

09:09.044 --> 09:11.344
Okay, you guys both suck at
coming up with dating ideas.

09:11.346 --> 09:13.780
Your window of
opportunity is down to one.

09:13.782 --> 09:15.448
There's no room for error!

09:15.450 --> 09:17.050
I am picking the next activity!

09:17.052 --> 09:18.685
If it's not happening,
it's not happening!

09:18.687 --> 09:20.487
Maybe fate has decided it for us.

09:20.489 --> 09:21.721
“Fate”? There is no fate.

09:21.723 --> 09:23.723
I am fate. I am also destiny,

09:23.725 --> 09:25.859
déjà vu and roller coaster tummy.

09:25.861 --> 09:28.294
And fate... is telling you

09:28.296 --> 09:30.397
you're going to have your
first kiss with Gavin

09:30.399 --> 09:34.267
on the most romantic date of all time.

09:34.269 --> 09:35.468
Amy, I don't...

09:35.470 --> 09:37.637
On your sofa, under a blanket,

09:37.639 --> 09:39.906
watching a cooking show.

09:39.908 --> 09:42.876
Oh, that's actually a good idea.

09:42.878 --> 09:44.978
Oh, your hair actually looks good today.

09:44.980 --> 09:46.846
See how that feels?

09:48.550 --> 09:49.983
Hey, babe. (groans)

09:49.985 --> 09:51.418
I was cruising in your hood.

09:51.420 --> 09:54.120
Thought I'd pop by and see if you wanted

09:54.122 --> 09:56.256
to take some risks.

09:56.258 --> 09:58.024
Is this another flea market?

09:58.026 --> 09:59.826
No, it's not another f...

09:59.828 --> 10:01.494
I was thinking maybe we wanted

10:01.496 --> 10:03.797
to put our lives on
the line with a hike.

10:03.799 --> 10:05.131
Not just any hike.

10:05.133 --> 10:08.268
An illegal hike up
to the Hollywood sign.

10:08.270 --> 10:10.170
How is that gonna be dangerous?

10:10.172 --> 10:13.907
Well, because they'll be nothing
between the rattle snakes' fangs

10:13.909 --> 10:16.209
And... my calves.

10:16.211 --> 10:17.677
- (laughs)
- Huh?

10:17.679 --> 10:18.832
Sexy.

10:18.983 --> 10:20.780
Wait till you have to
help me pull them off.

10:20.782 --> 10:22.315
Over the boot. Now is good, by the way.

10:22.317 --> 10:23.450
- Oh.
- A little help.

10:23.452 --> 10:24.484
(laughs): Okay.

10:24.486 --> 10:25.752
All right, Travis.

10:25.754 --> 10:27.787
I am updating the listing right now.

10:27.789 --> 10:29.055
Thank you... No!

10:29.057 --> 10:31.624
You rock out with your... Bye.

10:31.626 --> 10:34.227
Can you walk me through how
you updated that listing?

10:34.229 --> 10:35.428
- Sure.
- Great.

10:35.430 --> 10:36.896
Eventually, but first,

10:36.898 --> 10:38.965
I have something more
important I need from you.

10:38.967 --> 10:41.234
- Is that stuffing more envelopes?
- It is stuffing more envelopes.

10:41.236 --> 10:43.703
So, just, uh, check in with
me at the end of the day.

10:43.705 --> 10:45.638
Or just go, you know.

10:45.640 --> 10:47.207
Okay.

10:47.209 --> 10:49.242
(whispers): Hey, Clara?

10:49.244 --> 10:50.643
What?

10:50.645 --> 10:52.378
What is the deal with my intern,

10:52.380 --> 10:53.847
Old Mother Hubbard?

10:55.750 --> 10:57.317
It was strange.

10:57.319 --> 10:58.985
They called me last
minute from the corporate office

10:58.987 --> 11:00.620
and just added her.

11:00.622 --> 11:02.922
Kind of reminds me of
that show Undercover Boss.

11:02.924 --> 11:05.158
That's not what this is.
There are no cameras.

11:05.160 --> 11:07.760
I know, but it's a thing
companies are doing now.

11:07.762 --> 11:09.395
The CEO dresses up in disguise

11:09.397 --> 11:11.397
and just drops in on random branches.

11:11.399 --> 11:12.866
W-W-Wait, right there.

11:12.868 --> 11:14.901
Click on that pic of our CEO.

11:22.344 --> 11:24.544
Oh, my God.

11:24.546 --> 11:26.346
I bosom-bumped our CEO.

11:26.348 --> 11:28.381
Yeah.

11:28.383 --> 11:30.917
Wow, I am so sore.

11:30.919 --> 11:32.260
That workout was no joke.

11:32.264 --> 11:34.087
Oh, you humans and your workouts.

11:34.089 --> 11:35.622
It's a complete waste of time.

11:35.624 --> 11:37.257
Everybody's death date
is predetermined anyway.

11:37.259 --> 11:38.658
Really? So when's mine?

11:38.660 --> 11:39.826
A Tuesday.

11:39.828 --> 11:41.060
And that's all I can tell you.

11:41.062 --> 11:42.428
But, hey, it's a Saturday,

11:42.430 --> 11:43.897
so let's just relax

11:43.899 --> 11:45.899
and focus on getting you that kiss.

11:45.901 --> 11:47.567
Because it could be your last.

11:48.403 --> 11:50.069
That's a total joke.

11:50.071 --> 11:51.404
- Hmm.
- (knocking)

11:51.406 --> 11:53.072
All right.

11:53.074 --> 11:55.441
This is the last time you're
gonna see me tonight.

11:55.443 --> 11:57.810
Invisibility... on!

11:57.812 --> 11:59.879
- Nope.
- Takes about 20 seconds to kick in.

11:59.881 --> 12:01.414
I'll just scurry
quickly into the kitchen.

12:01.416 --> 12:03.249
(knocking continues)

12:03.251 --> 12:05.218
(groans)

12:05.220 --> 12:07.053
It's unlocked!

12:07.055 --> 12:09.055
- Hi.
- Hi!

12:09.057 --> 12:10.390
Come here, you.

12:10.392 --> 12:12.058
Ah.

12:12.060 --> 12:13.526
I was thinking we could just sit here

12:13.528 --> 12:16.996
on my soft couch and watch some TV.

12:16.998 --> 12:18.731
Take it you're pretty
sore from our workout.

12:18.733 --> 12:19.933
Yes.

12:19.935 --> 12:21.301
Even my fingertips are sore.

12:21.303 --> 12:22.602
I cried writing an e-mail.

12:22.604 --> 12:23.903
(both laugh)

12:23.905 --> 12:25.638
Oh, it hurts to flirt.

12:27.175 --> 12:28.408
Parkour!

12:28.410 --> 12:29.542
Pretty impressive, Marv.

12:29.544 --> 12:31.644
They should call it Marv-kour!

12:31.646 --> 12:33.146
Okay.

12:33.148 --> 12:35.315
Here we go.

12:35.317 --> 12:36.749
Good thing you look good in orange,

12:36.751 --> 12:39.686
because our life of crime begins now.

12:39.688 --> 12:41.821
Okay, what is going on with you?

12:41.823 --> 12:43.156
Is this about Raphael?

12:43.158 --> 12:45.558
The smoke jumper's name is “Raphael”?

12:45.560 --> 12:47.293
Are you kidding me?

12:47.295 --> 12:49.028
My name is Marv.

12:49.030 --> 12:50.363
Can we just go get some coffee?

12:50.365 --> 12:51.931
I can have fun with you anywhere.

12:51.933 --> 12:54.567
No, the greater the
risk, the greater the reward!

12:54.569 --> 12:58.037
I just thought of a tremendous reward.

12:58.039 --> 13:00.840
Are you talking about
intimacy al fresco?

13:00.842 --> 13:02.809
A gentleman only implies.

13:02.811 --> 13:04.344
But...

13:04.346 --> 13:06.312
yes.

13:06.314 --> 13:07.780
Come with me.

13:07.782 --> 13:09.148
- Snake!
- Ooh!

13:09.150 --> 13:10.283
Nah, just a stick.

13:10.285 --> 13:11.618
We're good.

13:15.523 --> 13:17.690
(both laughing)

13:20.495 --> 13:22.328
(gasps)

13:22.330 --> 13:24.197
(phone ringing)

13:24.199 --> 13:26.466
Sorry.

13:26.468 --> 13:28.001
No, no, no. Put the phone down.

13:28.003 --> 13:29.335
Hello?

13:29.337 --> 13:31.070
Someone better be dead.

13:31.072 --> 13:32.138
Okay.

13:32.140 --> 13:33.306
Yeah, I'll be right there.

13:33.308 --> 13:34.941
Sorry, that was Linda.

13:34.943 --> 13:36.309
The reception was
bad, but it sounds like

13:36.311 --> 13:37.343
my dad hurt himself on the hike.

13:37.345 --> 13:39.112
- Is he okay?
- I don't know.

13:39.114 --> 13:40.213
- I should probably go check on him.
- Yeah.

13:40.215 --> 13:41.347
If I could walk.

13:41.349 --> 13:42.949
I literally broke you on our date.

13:42.951 --> 13:44.150
Let me drive you.

13:44.152 --> 13:46.719
That'd be nice. Thank you.

13:46.721 --> 13:47.787
No, no, no! You can't leave!

13:47.789 --> 13:48.988
Your “woo” will close!

13:48.990 --> 13:50.256
You can't let your “woo” close!

13:50.258 --> 13:51.524
- Stop talking about my “woo”".
- Oh, please.

13:51.526 --> 13:52.959
He doesn't know what it means.

13:52.961 --> 13:53.893
Window of opportunity.

13:53.895 --> 13:55.628
Dangnabbit!

13:55.630 --> 13:57.848
We must have a mole.

14:02.298 --> 14:04.444
Oa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:04.446 --> 14:08.315
What... is my prized intern... doing...

14:08.317 --> 14:09.783
stuffing these envelopes?

14:09.785 --> 14:11.151
Oh, seems like a waste.

14:11.153 --> 14:13.186
A wasted opportunity...

14:13.188 --> 14:14.922
for a lesson.

14:14.924 --> 14:16.023
Which is...

14:16.025 --> 14:17.925
to... sell the earth,

14:17.927 --> 14:19.359
we must first, what?

14:19.361 --> 14:21.094
Save the earth.

14:21.096 --> 14:23.130
Get ready for a lot of
those, because from now on,

14:23.132 --> 14:24.798
you're gonna be shadowing
me so you can learn

14:24.800 --> 14:26.867
about all the amazing
things we do in this office.

14:26.869 --> 14:28.101
(phone rings)

14:28.103 --> 14:30.504
Brad Fuller's office.

14:30.506 --> 14:32.372
Oh, my gosh, I'll tell him right away.

14:32.374 --> 14:33.774
It's your sister.

14:33.776 --> 14:36.610
Apparently, your dad hurt
himself on a hike.

14:36.612 --> 14:38.845
Don't care. Only thing that
matters in life is this company.

14:38.847 --> 14:40.914
That's not true, it's family.

14:40.916 --> 14:42.316
That was a test, you passed.

14:42.318 --> 14:43.684
Saddle up, shadow.

14:43.686 --> 14:45.619
We're gonna get our family on.

14:45.621 --> 14:47.321
♪ ♪

14:47.323 --> 14:50.023
Oh, my gosh, I love this look.

14:50.025 --> 14:51.491
Listen, I screwed up.

14:51.493 --> 14:52.993
I screwed up bad.

14:52.995 --> 14:54.494
I still haven't been able to get

14:54.496 --> 14:56.430
Allison and Gavin to
seal it with a smooch,

14:56.432 --> 14:58.031
and I fear time is running out.

14:58.033 --> 15:00.000
Amy, I am out of the game.

15:00.002 --> 15:02.636
And I have a huge pastel
color wheel test at 4:00.

15:02.638 --> 15:04.237
We moved that up to 3:00.

15:04.239 --> 15:06.173
Damn it. Amy, can you just
say what you need to say

15:06.175 --> 15:08.141
and then teach me 63 shades of pink?

15:08.143 --> 15:09.509
Okay, well, I've just been thinking

15:09.511 --> 15:12.479
that I might as well stop angeling too.

15:12.481 --> 15:13.568
- What?
- Where can I get an

15:13.593 --> 15:14.881
application for this place?

15:14.883 --> 15:16.350
And I think I'd be really
good at this job.

15:16.352 --> 15:17.551
Hey, lady.

15:17.553 --> 15:18.752
Petites are over here.

15:18.754 --> 15:20.554
Big girl, over there.

15:20.556 --> 15:22.222
Don't do that.

15:22.224 --> 15:25.125
This reverse psychology
stuff isn't gonna work on me.

15:25.127 --> 15:26.460
I just spent the last two weeks

15:26.462 --> 15:28.095
