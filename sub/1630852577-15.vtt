out there,

they're, like, oh, my God,

05:50.750 --> 05:52.252

06:07.567 --> 06:11.137
This season, we're

that loses the lip sync

06:14.107 --> 06:15.842

07:04.190 --> 07:07.394
with the very first
"it's chocolate."

07:07.394 --> 07:09.229
How did that feel?

07:09.229 --> 07:11.031
It's just funny to see,
like, people do TikToks

07:11.031 --> 07:12.032
and, like, you know...

07:13.633 --> 07:14.868
Like, it's just kinda like--

07:14.868 --> 07:16.436
if that's my claim to fame,
she'll take it.

07:16.436 --> 07:17.671
Okay.

07:17.671 --> 07:19.739
I just wish I wasn't
in that pussycat wig.

07:21.308 --> 07:24.944

to unwrap the golden candy bar?

07:24.944 --> 07:25.979
It was incredible.

07:25.979 --> 07:28.114
I remember
just scream laughing

07:28.114 --> 07:29.449
for at least 30 minutes,

07:29.449 --> 07:31.351
and then you had
to usher me off stage

07:31.351 --> 07:32.886
Bitch, the whole time

07:32.886 --> 07:34.220
I was, like, damn it!

07:34.220 --> 07:36.690
I was like, fuck!

07:36.690 --> 07:39.125
What is it gonna take?
[laughs]

07:39.125 --> 07:41.995
Thought you had sent Miss Thing
to the house.

07:41.995 --> 07:46.399
Now, we were all sad when
Kornbread sent a taped message

07:46.399 --> 07:48.702
that she had to leave
the competition early.

07:48.702 --> 07:51.571
I rolled my ankle,
and the doctor gave me orders

07:51.571 --> 07:54.307
to stay off of my feet for
six to eight weeks.

07:54.307 --> 07:58.445
Now, Kornbread, how did it feel,
rewatching that moment?

07:58.445 --> 08:01.214
Um, being told that, you know,
"All right, girl,

08:01.214 --> 08:03.016
that's it for you,"
was crushing,

08:03.016 --> 08:05.352
but watching it on the TV,
it's, like, okay, cool.

08:05.352 --> 08:06.486
It's more settled
in your spirit

08:06.486 --> 08:08.521
of, like, what happened,
but still not fun.

08:08.521 --> 08:09.756
I wish I was there.

08:09.756 --> 08:11.124
Maybe Snatch Game
would have been better.

08:11.124 --> 08:13.360
[all laugh]

08:13.360 --> 08:15.128
-It would have been.
-Yay-ya!

08:15.128 --> 08:16.363
It definitely would have been.

08:16.363 --> 08:18.131
So, Kornbread, you opened up

08:18.131 --> 08:21.101
about your relationship
with your family.

08:21.101 --> 08:22.802
Let's take a look.

08:22.802 --> 08:27.073
Growing up, I had my moments
of extreme flamboyancy,

08:27.073 --> 08:29.442
and my mom,
she would not like it,

08:29.442 --> 08:32.912
and she would state
that she did not like it.

08:32.912 --> 08:35.782
It's hard to like
find an acceptance,

08:35.782 --> 08:37.851
and I just...

08:40.887 --> 08:43.590
I've felt like
such a disappointment

08:43.590 --> 08:45.558
for a long time.

08:45.558 --> 08:48.228
I would just literally
sometimes go to sleep

08:48.228 --> 08:50.230
so disappointed in myself,

08:50.230 --> 08:53.800
and I would just pray
that I didn't wake up.

08:55.068 --> 08:57.837
When I was around 16 years old,

08:57.837 --> 09:01.341
I ended up moving in
with one of my theater friends,

09:01.341 --> 09:04.377
and my family
didn't look for me,

09:04.377 --> 09:06.012
and I was literally
around the corner.

09:09.149 --> 09:12.585
Has your relationship
with your family

09:12.585 --> 09:14.154
changed since the show?

09:14.154 --> 09:15.155
It has drastically.

09:15.155 --> 09:16.556
These moments being brought out

09:16.556 --> 09:17.657
were moments
I didn't know I needed

09:17.657 --> 09:18.958
and actually needed,

09:18.958 --> 09:20.293
and my family
had to watch this

09:20.293 --> 09:22.328
without having a rebuttal
for what I had to say.

09:22.328 --> 09:24.397
So I honestly think
this was the best moment

09:24.397 --> 09:25.398
for it to happen.

09:25.398 --> 09:27.033
Have you seen them since?

09:27.033 --> 09:28.868
Oh, yeah.
I just recently went home

09:28.868 --> 09:30.637
to South Carolina to do a gig.

09:30.637 --> 09:32.939
I didn't know Columbia,
South Carolina had a drag scene.

09:32.939 --> 09:34.874
Who would have known, honey?
[all laugh]

09:34.874 --> 09:37.710
My entire family
showed up to my drag show,

09:37.710 --> 09:39.479
which was freaking amazing.

09:39.479 --> 09:40.814
We had a little cookout, girl.

09:40.814 --> 09:42.515
I showed up in geesh,
had the inches down,

09:42.515 --> 09:44.150
the bad girls pushed up.

09:44.150 --> 09:47.587
RuPaul's Drag Race still
bringing families together.

09:47.587 --> 09:50.123
[laughter and applause]

09:50.123 --> 09:52.992
Now, in a season
of sisterly love,

09:52.992 --> 09:55.094
there was still
a lot of drama, mama.

09:55.094 --> 09:56.296
-Hello.
-Yes.

09:56.296 --> 09:59.399
Let's flashback
in a series we're calling

09:59.399 --> 10:02.769
"Clash of the Queens."

10:02.769 --> 10:04.537
-[all laugh]
-Ooh, bitch.

10:04.537 --> 10:05.705
Like I didn't do a gown.

10:05.705 --> 10:07.006
I tried to do something
a little bit different,

10:07.006 --> 10:08.942
but I can understand
if they didn't like the nude.

10:08.942 --> 10:10.543
I'm a person
who talks a lot,

10:10.543 --> 10:13.413
but when I talk,
I have conversation.

10:13.413 --> 10:15.014
Miss Jasmine don't do that.

10:15.014 --> 10:18.051
I do, like, notice
that, like, I talk a lot.

10:18.051 --> 10:19.085
Since you opened up the door--

10:19.085 --> 10:20.353
-Excuse me.
-Yeah, go ahead.

10:20.353 --> 10:21.721
It is the simple fact
that there's a difference

10:21.721 --> 10:24.624
between talking
and having a conversation.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.726
It's a lot of us in here,
absolutely.

10:26.726 --> 10:28.228
-No, I see, I see.
-Like now.

10:28.228 --> 10:30.129
Did you see
what you just did?

10:30.129 --> 10:31.397
In the middle
of me explaining

10:31.397 --> 10:34.234
how I felt about it
and trying to express it to you,

10:34.234 --> 10:35.902
you chopped me off.

10:35.902 --> 10:37.003
Well, I just heard a pause--

10:37.003 --> 10:40.306
Like again.

10:40.306 --> 10:41.641
I wanna, like--

10:41.641 --> 10:43.710
Kerri, pause two seconds.
Sis.

10:43.710 --> 10:45.411
If you're writing, that means
you're not paying attention

10:45.411 --> 10:46.646
to what the group
is talking about.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.481
Just put the pad down, baby.
Join in.

10:48.481 --> 10:50.450
You're good. Cool.

10:50.450 --> 10:54.287
Kornbread is pissed at literally
anything Jasmine is doing.

10:54.287 --> 10:55.622
Like, stop breathing over there.

10:55.622 --> 10:56.656
I see you blinking,

10:56.656 --> 10:58.391
and it's taking up
a lot of room.

10:59.659 --> 11:01.561
Oh, let me take a sip.

11:01.561 --> 11:03.429
So, Kornbread,
what prompted you

11:03.429 --> 11:05.465
to say something to Jasmine?

11:05.465 --> 11:06.499
Well, first off,
and everybody in this room

11:06.499 --> 11:07.467
can tell you,
I wasn't gonna say--

11:07.467 --> 11:08.468
I wasn't saying nothin'.

11:08.468 --> 11:10.036
Jasmine opened up
the invitation.

11:10.036 --> 11:11.638
I told her, because no shade,

11:11.638 --> 11:14.007
the rest of the girls will
have conversations about it,

11:14.007 --> 11:15.208
but not conversations
with Jasmine.

11:15.208 --> 11:16.809
I'm not one of those
kind of people.

11:16.809 --> 11:17.844
Thank you, Kornbread,

11:17.844 --> 11:18.978
for being the only girl
to talk to me.

11:18.978 --> 11:20.880
You still cut me off,
and I live for it.

11:20.880 --> 11:23.416
[laughter and applause]

11:23.416 --> 11:25.552
Gag me. I'm still learning.
I'm still learning.

11:25.552 --> 11:27.287
The girls talked about it,
but not to Jasmine.

11:27.287 --> 11:28.321
That's not how I roll.

11:28.321 --> 11:29.756
Imma tell you how I feel.

11:29.756 --> 11:31.558
A lot of people get on this show
and they get a little afraid,

11:31.558 --> 11:33.059
like, oh, I need to edit
what I'm saying

11:33.059 --> 11:34.727
because I'm afraid
of what the world thinks.

11:34.727 --> 11:35.929
That's not how we do over here,

11:35.929 --> 11:37.196
and I told Jasmine simply,

11:37.196 --> 11:39.933
girl, you're doing the mizzost.

11:39.933 --> 11:41.701
Did any of the other girls
feel the same way?

11:41.701 --> 11:43.002
Well, I'm not going to lie.

11:43.002 --> 11:44.437
The first couple of weeks, girl,

11:44.437 --> 11:46.506
you was on 110, bitch,

11:46.506 --> 11:47.707
and I think
we all were just, like,

11:47.707 --> 11:51.411
okay, girl,
like, what's going on?

11:51.411 --> 11:55.148
So does anybody think that
Kornbread went too far? June?

11:55.148 --> 11:57.951
I've known Bread for nine years,

11:57.951 --> 12:01.054
and I know that
when she feels something,

12:01.054 --> 12:02.722
she just gives it to you
straight, no chaser.

12:02.722 --> 12:06.059
It was needed,
but it was just so direct.

12:06.059 --> 12:09.062
Yes, maybe
in the second episode

12:09.062 --> 12:11.297
when you are working
together in the teams,

12:11.297 --> 12:14.067
you were very, like,
into Jasmine.

12:14.067 --> 12:17.570
Could I have approached that
absolutely different? 100%.

12:17.570 --> 12:19.005
We all learned
from the situation.

12:19.005 --> 12:20.974
Jasmine taught me just as much
as I hope I taught Jasmine,

12:20.974 --> 12:22.675
even though she cut me off
a billion times.

12:22.675 --> 12:24.444
[all laugh]

12:24.444 --> 12:26.179
And I will say this again.

12:26.179 --> 12:28.815
If it was not for that
conversation
with Kornbread,

12:28.815 --> 12:31.618
the way I handled this entire
season would have not happened.

12:31.618 --> 12:33.786
I will say that
I'm kind of proud

12:33.786 --> 12:35.955
that your attitude
moving forward after that

12:35.955 --> 12:38.591
was always, like,
relentlessly positive,

12:38.591 --> 12:40.927
kind of like you know how you're
trying to kill a cockroach

12:40.927 --> 12:43.196
and it doesn't die?

12:43.196 --> 12:44.664
It just stays there
or it runs away.

12:44.664 --> 12:46.265
[all laugh]
You know?

12:46.265 --> 12:47.433
I'm really proud
that you were

12:47.433 --> 12:49.402
just that resilient cockroach
the whole time.

12:49.402 --> 12:51.504
[all laugh]
I'm a resilient cockroach.

12:51.504 --> 12:54.907
So, Jasmine, I know
you like to have the last word.

12:54.907 --> 12:57.210
Would you like to have the last
word on the subject now?

12:57.210 --> 12:58.678
Um...

12:58.678 --> 13:00.279
This is your moment.

13:00.279 --> 13:01.914
This is your moment.
Have it.

13:01.914 --> 13:04.417
This is your moment.
Have it.

13:04.417 --> 13:06.386
Well, ladies and gentlemen,
as you can see

13:06.386 --> 13:08.121
that chapter is closed.

13:08.121 --> 13:09.622
Let's go
to the next fight I'm in.

13:09.622 --> 13:12.358
[cheers and laughter]

13:12.358 --> 13:14.694
Now, you may have noticed

13:14.694 --> 13:17.096
the queens and I are enjoying

13:17.096 --> 13:19.832
new House of Love
cocktails and mocktails.

13:19.832 --> 13:23.603
They come in six fresh
and fabulous flavors,

13:23.603 --> 13:27.540
from Tangerine Margarita
to Ginger Mule.

13:27.540 --> 13:29.609
I think I went
to Hebrew school with her.

13:29.609 --> 13:31.444
Mmm, I love that drink.

13:31.444 --> 13:32.679
[all laugh]

13:32.679 --> 13:36.015
Scan the QR code or visit
HouseofLovecocktails.com

13:36.015 --> 13:38.451
to pre-order yours now.

13:38.451 --> 13:40.086
Everybody say love.

13:40.086 --> 13:41.754
All: Love!

13:41.754 --> 13:43.723
We'll be right back.

13:44.090 --> 13:47.026
♪ I bring the beat,
I bring the beat ♪

13:47.026 --> 13:49.729
Welcome back
to RuPaul's Drag Race Reunited

13:49.729 --> 13:51.164
from Las Vegas.

13:51.164 --> 13:52.432
Now, in one week,

13:52.432 --> 13:55.401
we will crown
America's next drag superstar,

13:55.401 --> 14:00.373
but tonight we're going deep
with the queens of Season 14.

14:00.373 --> 14:03.176
Jasmine Kennedy,
Daya Betty, get ready

14:03.176 --> 14:05.478
because it's time for more...

14:06.546 --> 14:07.780
Let's take a look.

14:07.780 --> 14:10.216
[cheers and laughter]

14:10.216 --> 14:14.420
I did hear that you had
said some things about me

14:14.420 --> 14:16.589
that you have not yet
said to my face.

14:16.589 --> 14:18.624
Like what?

14:18.624 --> 14:20.827
Along the lines of
I rely on my body.

14:20.827 --> 14:23.996
Jasmine literally wrapped
just fabric around her body

14:23.996 --> 14:25.031
with a belt.

14:25.031 --> 14:26.065
It's just, like, so annoying

14:26.065 --> 14:28.267
when someone
has a perfect physique

14:28.267 --> 14:30.269
and they can get away
with wrapping a piece

14:30.269 --> 14:31.404
of fucking fabric
around their body.

14:31.404 --> 14:33.506
Yeah, I said that.

14:33.506 --> 14:35.141
I did.
[all laugh]

14:35.141 --> 14:36.943
But not to me.

14:36.943 --> 14:38.845
I was just shading you
because your outfit was bad.

14:38.845 --> 14:40.513
-Whoa!
-Oh!

14:40.513 --> 14:44.383
Honestly, Daya is upset because
she hasn't won anything yet.

14:44.383 --> 14:46.853
But, girl, you weren't
in the top for that challenge

14:46.853 --> 14:48.955
'cause your shit was wrinkled
and it looked ugly.

14:48.955 --> 14:52.425
Willow puts me
in a group with Jasmine.

14:52.425 --> 14:54.193
Jasmine's
like an energy vampire.

14:55.561 --> 14:57.930
No offense, Jasmine,
no offense, Jorgeous,

14:57.930 --> 15:01.334
but you've been
in the bottom a lot...

15:03.102 --> 15:04.737
No offense.

15:04.737 --> 15:07.640
...and it's starting to
really piss me the fuck off.

15:07.640 --> 15:10.109
Oh, my God, girl.

15:10.109 --> 15:12.779
Instead of saying no offense,
which is kind of just a buffer,

15:12.779 --> 15:14.247
why don't you just
say it out loud?

15:14.247 --> 15:15.748
I didn't know I was talking
to a counselor right now.

15:15.748 --> 15:17.216
-Oh!
-Oh!

15:17.216 --> 15:19.619
I don't want you
thinking that it's personal.

15:19.619 --> 15:20.887
But it's a little personal

15:20.887 --> 15:22.388
because you have come
for me and Jorgeous before

15:22.388 --> 15:24.323
in the past, and then
you group us again last time

15:24.323 --> 15:25.358
for kinda the same reason.

15:25.358 --> 15:27.093
Because you guys
got harsh critiques

15:27.093 --> 15:28.628
at which
we all got bad critiques.

15:28.628 --> 15:30.530
but you guys did get
really harsh critiques.

15:30.530 --> 15:32.165
-Yeah.
-That's why.

15:32.165 --> 15:33.699
No offense.

15:33.699 --> 15:36.002
[all laugh]

15:36.002 --> 15:38.671
Now, Daya, you were
certainly unfiltered.

15:38.671 --> 15:41.474
How does it feel
watching it back now?

15:41.474 --> 15:45.077
A lot of people ask me
if I regret anything I say

15:45.077 --> 15:47.613
or have done, and I don't.

15:47.613 --> 15:49.482
I firmly believe

15:49.482 --> 15:51.717
in speaking up
for how you feel.

15:51.717 --> 15:55.655
Now, watching myself back,
where I might have faltered

15:55.655 --> 15:57.690
and what I've learned
from the experience

15:57.690 --> 15:59.192
is the classic saying, like,

15:59.192 --> 16:02.061
it's not necessarily what
you say, but how you say it.

16:02.061 --> 16:04.096
But, girl, I said what I said.

16:04.096 --> 16:05.464
I don't take any
of that shit back.

16:05.464 --> 16:06.566
I was being honest.

16:06.566 --> 16:09.402
Jasmine said things
at the wrong time.

16:09.402 --> 16:12.905
It was always, like, when we
were prepping for the challenge

16:12.905 --> 16:15.107
or when we were really
stressed out about something,

16:15.107 --> 16:16.709
and she always chimed in

16:16.709 --> 16:18.978
right where she knew
my sweet spot was.

16:18.978 --> 16:21.247
Jasmine, is there anything
you'd like to say to Daya?

16:21.247 --> 16:24.083
I mean, I hope
we have enough time, but--

16:24.083 --> 16:25.551
[all laugh]

16:25.551 --> 16:29.722
Girl, you dragged me
for nine weeks straight.

16:29.722 --> 16:31.691
Instead of coming
towards my drag,

16:31.691 --> 16:33.860
you came towards who I was
as a person.

16:33.860 --> 16:36.562
You called me an energy vampire.

16:36.562 --> 16:37.830
You are. You were.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.465
I think you were
looking in the mirror

16:39.465 --> 16:40.700
when you said that.

16:40.700 --> 16:42.668
You know, vampires
can't see their reflections.

16:42.668 --> 16:46.706
But, baby, you would attack
people non-fucking-stop

16:46.706 --> 16:48.341
just so you would be fine

16:48.341 --> 16:50.776
no matter
what place you were at.

16:50.776 --> 16:52.144
Like, you could have been safe.

16:52.144 --> 16:53.980
Attack me and Jorgeous
because we're in the bottom,

16:53.980 --> 16:55.047
and we didn't get sent home.

16:55.047 --> 16:56.315
You really
went in hard on me

16:56.315 --> 16:57.516
for no reason half the time,

16:57.516 --> 16:59.819
and I took it for nine
fucking weeks straight.

16:59.819 --> 17:01.520
-Just saying.
-And you know what?

17:01.520 --> 17:03.422
You gave it back,
which I can appreciate.

17:03.422 --> 17:04.423
In a respectful way, though,

17:04.423 --> 17:05.424
and not in a rude way.

17:05.424 --> 17:06.692
Let's hear
what the other queens

17:06.692 --> 17:07.727
have to say
about this situation.

17:07.727 --> 17:10.062
I would love to say something

17:10.062 --> 17:12.198
because honestly,
like, with me and Jasmine,

17:12.198 --> 17:14.767
it felt like
you didn't respect us at all.

17:14.767 --> 17:16.369
Like, watching it,
it just showed, like,

17:16.369 --> 17:19.272
I felt, like,
you respected everyone else.

17:19.272 --> 17:21.574
I really want to make this clear
to both of you, okay?

17:21.574 --> 17:23.242
It might have felt personal,

17:23.242 --> 17:25.211
and I completely understand
your point of view.

17:25.211 --> 17:27.179
I really do.
Especially watching back,

17:27.179 --> 17:29.315
like, I totally understand

17:29.315 --> 17:30.950
how you could feel that way,

17:30.950 --> 17:32.518
and I am not
denying that at all.

17:32.518 --> 17:34.220
But think of it like this.

17:34.220 --> 17:36.489
Like, say you're in school

17:36.489 --> 17:39.525
and you're going to take,
like, a science test, okay?

17:39.525 --> 17:41.494
I didn't do none of that.

17:41.494 --> 17:44.797
[all laugh]

17:47.466 --> 17:49.435
You lost her right there, girl.

17:49.435 --> 17:51.671
[all laughing]
-You lost her at science.

17:51.671 --> 17:54.373
You lost her at science.
She can't relate.

17:54.373 --> 17:56.709
What I was trying to say is,
say you take a science test.

17:56.709 --> 17:58.177
say you completely
fucking bomb it.

17:58.177 --> 17:59.245
It doesn't mean
you're not smart.

17:59.245 --> 18:01.314
It just means
that you weren't fitting

18:01.314 --> 18:04.383
what the goal
or the objective was, and so--

18:04.383 --> 18:05.384
But that's your opinion.

18:05.384 --> 18:07.453
That affects the GPA, baby.

18:07.453 --> 18:08.854
[laughs]

18:08.854 --> 18:11.457
And the judges' opinion.
And the judges' opinion.

18:11.457 --> 18:14.060
But you feel like you can
be the voice for everyone,

18:14.060 --> 18:15.294
for the judges,
when in reality

18:15.294 --> 18:16.896
we aren't asking
your opinion about us.

18:16.896 --> 18:17.897
I never said
I was the voice.

18:17.897 --> 18:18.864
I was saying
that's how I felt.

18:18.864 --> 18:20.266
You can play back
any clip.

18:20.266 --> 18:21.634
You didn't ask. You made it
so you were the voice, girl.

18:21.634 --> 18:23.169
We didn't even have
an option to be anybody else.

18:23.169 --> 18:25.137
You can play back any clip,

18:25.137 --> 18:28.708
and it's always me
saying it is my opinion.

18:28.708 --> 18:30.409
No offense.
Then your opinion, yeah.

18:30.409 --> 18:31.644
Here's the thing,
here's the thing.

18:31.644 --> 18:33.879
Daya, you--
you are the bitch.

18:33.879 --> 18:36.549
-I personally know Daya.
-Mm-hmm.

18:36.549 --> 18:38.517
And, like, yes,
I was on the show 48 hours.

18:38.517 --> 18:39.685
[all laugh]

18:39.685 --> 18:43.155
Daya Betty
is genuinely a great person,

18:43.155 --> 18:45.124
but in the competition
setting,

18:45.124 --> 18:46.726
everyone handles stress
differently.

18:46.726 --> 18:48.327
In a stressful situation,

18:48.327 --> 18:50.329
she went in
completely unfiltered.

18:50.329 --> 18:53.833
So if she said something to you,
it wasn't personal.

18:53.833 --> 18:55.501
It was what she was seeing
from the judges

18:55.501 --> 18:56.569
and voicing it.

18:56.569 --> 18:57.903
Was it right? No.

18:57.903 --> 19:00.740
But that's how she was
handling the competition

19:00.740 --> 19:01.874
and the pressure
that she was under.

19:01.874 --> 19:03.242
I hear you.

19:03.242 --> 19:05.778
But that doesn't mean
that she's a bad person at all,

19:05.778 --> 19:09.448
because outside
of the competition--

19:09.448 --> 19:10.716
Daya--hold on one second.

19:10.716 --> 19:12.718
Daya, you're feeling
some kind of way right now.

19:12.718 --> 19:14.587
You have tears in your eyes.

19:14.587 --> 19:15.588
What's going on?

19:17.023 --> 19:19.125
It's just, like,
I'm not that person,

19:19.125 --> 19:21.660
and I feel like everybody
has this terrible idea

19:21.660 --> 19:23.796
of who I am, and I'm not.

19:23.796 --> 19:24.864
Like, I'm not.

19:24.864 --> 19:27.133
I just, like,
had my head in the game

19:27.133 --> 19:29.235
and, like, had my eyes
on the prize.

19:29.235 --> 19:31.904
What she said were things
that we were all thinking,

19:31.904 --> 19:34.707
stuff we said, even if it was,
like, off camera, whispered.

19:34.707 --> 19:37.810
And we were all being shady
to an extent and saying stuff.

19:37.810 --> 19:38.878
But you said, like,

19:38.878 --> 19:40.246
a lot of like
the shadiest shit.

19:40.246 --> 19:42.782
Not really.
I said everything pretty fair.

19:42.782 --> 19:45.184
And it was your opinion
and it was valid

19:45.184 --> 19:46.886
and it was fair
and so was hers.

19:46.886 --> 19:49.121
And I feel like people are
really gassing up this moment.

19:49.121 --> 19:50.990
-Please let me finish.
-Go ahead.

19:50.990 --> 19:54.160
I feel like what's happening
right now is not fair to her.

19:54.160 --> 19:56.028
She didn't say anything
that was, like, unforgivable.

19:56.028 --> 19:58.998
No, because let's talk
about the after bullshit.

19:58.998 --> 20:00.966
Because she hasn't talked to me
at all since fucking filming.

20:00.966 --> 20:02.835
That's bullshit.

20:02.835 --> 20:04.170
Bitch, you talked to me
one fucking time

20:04.170 --> 20:06.138
is when Daya facetimed,
and you apologized to me.

20:06.138 --> 20:08.274
And I called you
from right before Roscoe's

20:08.274 --> 20:09.909
to let you know I have
a feeling of some type of way.

20:09.909 --> 20:11.710
After that, you haven't
talked to me as a person.

20:11.710 --> 20:13.079
I haven't heard shit
about you, girl.

20:13.079 --> 20:14.680
I don't know
anything about you.

20:14.680 --> 20:15.881
So we're not sisters
in the sense

20:15.881 --> 20:17.683
where we kiki
and like everybody else.

20:17.683 --> 20:19.051
I don't know shit about you,

20:19.051 --> 20:20.086
so when you're coming at me

20:20.086 --> 20:21.220
and not having
any fucking problem

20:21.220 --> 20:22.388
with what you're saying

20:22.388 --> 20:23.456
but still haven't taken
accountability

20:23.456 --> 20:25.691
for what you said,
it's bullshit.

20:25.691 --> 20:28.394
How would you like me
to take accountability?

20:28.394 --> 20:31.197
I've literally said--
I have literally acknowledged

20:31.197 --> 20:33.566
the fact that the things
that I have said

20:33.566 --> 20:35.334
were fucking hateful
and rude,

20:35.334 --> 20:36.602
and I could have
said them better.

20:36.602 --> 20:38.604
Until a camera
is going on. Okay.

20:38.604 --> 20:41.073
No, I have said that in
a text message to you, Jasmine.

20:41.073 --> 20:42.808
And you know what? You telling
me I haven't contacted you?

20:42.808 --> 20:44.076
You've reached out to me
before--

20:44.076 --> 20:46.378
I reached out to you
to let you know about Roscoe's.

20:46.378 --> 20:49.415
I gave you a call, and guess
who didn't fucking answer? You.

20:49.415 --> 20:51.150
-So I don't wanna hear it--
-Okay, we're gonna go there?

20:51.150 --> 20:53.552
I don't wanna hear it.
Sit down.

20:53.552 --> 20:55.821
I think accountability
is important.

20:55.821 --> 20:58.357
Mistakes happen, and everybody
has to acknowledge

20:58.357 --> 21:00.292
that stress is real.

21:00.292 --> 21:04.630
Competition is real.
Anxiety is real.

21:04.630 --> 21:06.699
One thing that
I wanna address is

21:06.699 --> 21:10.669
Daya has gotten landslidely

21:10.669 --> 21:14.306
the most unfair amount of hate
in terms of death threats,

21:14.306 --> 21:15.708
people wishing her not well.

21:15.708 --> 21:17.843
People can't stand
anything about

21:17.843 --> 21:19.645
some of the things she does,
and that's not that's not fair.

21:19.645 --> 21:20.946
That's not right.

21:20.946 --> 21:23.616
And, yes, I understand
that there are character flaws.

21:23.616 --> 21:25.684
Nobody is asking her
to be perfect.

21:25.684 --> 21:28.053
And, yes, there are times
you're shady, bitch.

21:28.053 --> 21:29.054
We all have been there.

21:29.054 --> 21:32.124
We all have fucking been there,

21:32.124 --> 21:34.727
and you have to cut her
a little bit of slack.

21:34.727 --> 21:36.228
She did show redemption.

21:36.228 --> 21:37.997
She did show that she cared.

21:37.997 --> 21:40.199
And the thing is, if y'all
have a problem with it,

21:40.199 --> 21:41.834
y'all gotta put the proof
in the pudding.

21:41.834 --> 21:44.370
And in the future,
what'll happen will see itself.

21:44.370 --> 21:45.771
And please, like,

21:45.771 --> 21:48.407
No, let Daya talk.

21:48.407 --> 21:51.477
What I am saying
is, like, I just get so, like...

21:53.479 --> 21:55.047
-You're passionate.
-Yeah.

21:55.047 --> 21:56.415
It's what I love.

21:56.415 --> 21:58.617
Like, it's what I love,
and I'm, like,

21:58.617 --> 22:01.654
I'm sorry
for the way I said things.

22:01.654 --> 22:04.590
I really am, and, like,
Jorgeous, I adore you.

22:04.590 --> 22:06.058
I fucking adore you.

22:06.058 --> 22:07.860
And, Jasmine, the more
I watch myself on TV,

22:07.860 --> 22:09.995
the more I'm, like,
I am just like her.

22:09.995 --> 22:12.932
Like, I'm literally
just like an older Jasmine.

22:12.932 --> 22:14.533
But prettier.
I'm just kidding.

22:14.533 --> 22:16.602
[all laugh]

22:16.602 --> 22:17.836
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

22:17.836 --> 22:20.539
No offense. No offense.

22:20.539 --> 22:22.575
No offense.
No offense.

22:22.575 --> 22:25.044
All right, I think it's time
for a quick break.

22:25.044 --> 22:27.613
I think everyone
could use it right now.

22:27.613 --> 22:28.881
We'll be right back.

22:31.016 --> 22:34.987
Welcome back to Reunited
Season 14 from Las Vegas.

22:34.987 --> 22:38.791
Next is a queen
who's all tea, all trade.

22:38.791 --> 22:40.192
Let's take a look.

22:40.192 --> 22:41.460
Ooh!

22:41.460 --> 22:46.565
Ahh. Get this shit
off my face. Aah!

22:46.565 --> 22:49.001
-Aw, shit.
-How are you guys?

22:49.001 --> 22:50.669
-I'm from Puerto Rico.
-Yeah.

22:52.805 --> 22:55.074
Damn.

22:55.074 --> 22:57.476
Damn.

22:57.476 --> 22:59.278
-As she willing--
-Hey-ey. [laughs]

22:59.278 --> 23:02.615
When they got there.
I knew what up under there.

23:02.615 --> 23:03.949
[laughs]

23:03.949 --> 23:06.752
When I say that is
a handsome Latin man,

23:06.752 --> 23:09.755
I was, like, oh.

23:09.755 --> 23:13.492
¿Cómo estás? ¿Cómo estás?
Hola.

23:13.492 --> 23:14.727
Wow.

23:14.727 --> 23:16.629
[all laugh]

23:16.629 --> 23:18.530
-Oh, my goodness.
-Muy caliente.

23:18.530 --> 23:22.268
So, Alyssa, do you mind being
called the trade of the season?

23:22.268 --> 23:24.103
Well, that's a compliment,

23:24.103 --> 23:25.604
so I'm just waiting
for my check.

23:25.604 --> 23:26.972
Do you have my check
for that?

23:26.972 --> 23:28.040
Or maybe a trophy?

23:28.040 --> 23:29.541
Has to be a prize next year.

23:29.541 --> 23:30.643
Here's the thing, Ru.

23:30.643 --> 23:32.344
That's a talent
to be, like, a trade.

23:32.344 --> 23:33.912
Well, listen, America agrees,

23:33.912 --> 23:35.214
and they have
some questions, like--

23:35.214 --> 23:37.082
-Ooh.
-Oh, okay.

23:37.082 --> 23:38.651
"Are you in a relationship?"

23:38.651 --> 23:40.085
"How do you meet people?"

23:40.085 --> 23:41.220
"What's your type?"

23:41.220 --> 23:43.589
"When you cuddle,
are you the big spoon

23:43.589 --> 23:45.357
or the little spoon?"

23:45.357 --> 23:47.293
Angeria actually
made me say that one.

23:47.293 --> 23:50.529
[all laugh]
We on the same page, twin.

23:50.529 --> 23:52.498
Yeah, bitch?

23:52.498 --> 23:54.733
Well, I'm single right now.

23:54.733 --> 23:56.902
No, girl,
cut all the bullshit.

23:56.902 --> 23:59.104
We just really
want to know how big is it?

23:59.104 --> 24:01.273
We've been bird-watching
this whole time.

24:01.273 --> 24:02.474
I was gonna say

24:02.474 --> 24:03.742
we've been bird-watching
the whole season.

24:03.742 --> 24:06.011
You might as well
let it out the cage.

24:06.011 --> 24:07.613
I'm ready to be impressed.

24:07.613 --> 24:09.048
-Okay.
-Well, yeah,

24:09.048 --> 24:11.517
I'm from Puerto Rico, so...

24:11.517 --> 24:16.722
Now, this season, love was
blowing in the Daytona Winds.

24:16.722 --> 24:17.856
Oh, my God.

24:17.856 --> 24:19.291
"Maxine!"

24:19.291 --> 24:20.759
Or was it?

24:20.759 --> 24:22.061
Let's check out the evidence.

24:22.061 --> 24:23.495
Take a look.

24:23.495 --> 24:26.699
I'm sort of like the sixth
member of the Spice Girls.

24:26.699 --> 24:28.467
I'm Country Spice.
It's nice to meet you.

24:28.467 --> 24:31.303
That accent, it's just really
getting my nipples hard.

24:31.303 --> 24:32.471
-Whoo!
-Yes!

24:32.471 --> 24:34.373
We can, like,
find us a room

24:34.373 --> 24:37.042
and just talk
to each other all day.

24:37.042 --> 24:38.844
I love Angeria's
Southern accent.

24:38.844 --> 24:40.612
Oh, you're super nice.

24:40.612 --> 24:42.915
Whoo, that Camden.

24:42.915 --> 24:46.318
She could be, like,
the ivory to my ebony. [laughs]

24:46.318 --> 24:48.520
Lady Camden
is the one girl

24:48.520 --> 24:50.756
that I am the most fond of.

24:50.756 --> 24:55.027
The name of the game
is making what we have work.

24:55.027 --> 24:56.929
Yeah. Angeria
sees something in me

24:56.929 --> 24:58.997
that I don't always
see in myself honestly.

24:58.997 --> 25:00.733
I love you very much.
I really do.

25:00.733 --> 25:01.734
I love you, too.

25:01.734 --> 25:03.769
Lady Camden, we get to kiss.

25:03.769 --> 25:06.071
Wow!

25:06.071 --> 25:07.239
[laughs]

25:07.239 --> 25:10.976
Maxine!

25:10.976 --> 25:12.444
Will you finally marry me?

25:12.444 --> 25:14.613
Aww!
[all laugh]

25:14.613 --> 25:16.782
CamGeria!

25:16.782 --> 25:18.617
[laughter and applause]

25:18.617 --> 25:23.155
So Angeria,
what drew you to Lady Camden?

25:23.155 --> 25:24.656
It was that accent, girl.

25:24.656 --> 25:28.761
Lady Camden is the first person
that I've ever met from the UK.

25:28.761 --> 25:30.829
So, you know,
I'd heard it on TV,

25:30.829 --> 25:33.432
but to hear that accent
in person,

25:33.432 --> 25:35.334
I said, oh, my God.

25:35.334 --> 25:38.003
My toes has started
curling up and stuff.

25:38.003 --> 25:39.671
I said, oh, mama.

25:39.671 --> 25:41.373
She need to touch it, honey.

25:41.373 --> 25:44.543
And Camden, what what's
so special about Angeria?

25:44.543 --> 25:46.478
I think when I first
came into the werkroom,

25:46.478 --> 25:47.713
and obviously
we're all nervous

25:47.713 --> 25:49.214
when we first
step into this competition.

25:49.214 --> 25:50.682
I think Angie
was the first person

25:50.682 --> 25:52.217
that made me feel so relaxed,

25:52.217 --> 25:54.019
but kind of like special.

25:54.019 --> 25:55.187
I don't know.

25:55.187 --> 25:57.022
Like, she made me feel
like unique and special.

25:57.022 --> 25:59.391
Everything I say
makes her fucking crack up,

25:59.391 --> 26:01.460
so I stepped
into the Snatch Game

26:01.460 --> 26:02.461
thinking I was about to win,

26:02.461 --> 26:04.430
because everything
I fucking said--

26:04.430 --> 26:06.365
She not gonna blame it
on me, though.

26:06.365 --> 26:08.167
-I'm blaming Angeria.
-You're not gonna blame me.

26:08.167 --> 26:11.103
I thought my pussy was on fire.
I fear it was not.

26:11.103 --> 26:12.538
[all laugh]

26:12.538 --> 26:15.040
Well, the fans
felt your attraction

26:15.040 --> 26:17.843
and dubbed you CamGeria.

26:17.843 --> 26:21.747
Now I hear that Ariana Grande
is hosting your wedding?

26:21.747 --> 26:23.382
[all laugh]

26:23.382 --> 26:26.752
Yeah, I will say
she did slide into my DMs

26:26.752 --> 26:29.354
and told me how cute
me and Camden were.

26:29.354 --> 26:31.156
-Okay.
-So, yeah.

26:31.156 --> 26:33.959
So if we ever
do need a minister

26:33.959 --> 26:35.627
for the ceremony,
I'm pretty sure

26:35.627 --> 26:37.763
she would be
very happy to do so.

26:37.763 --> 26:39.598
What's the future hold
for you two?

26:39.598 --> 26:40.732
I don't know.
I'm kind of just

26:40.732 --> 26:42.801
excited to spend
some more time with Angeria

26:42.801 --> 26:44.203
and figure this out.

26:44.203 --> 26:45.871
It's early days, you know.

26:45.871 --> 26:47.673
I'm a Leo,
give it all straight away.

26:47.673 --> 26:50.075
-I do love drag queens.
-Yeah, you do.

26:50.075 --> 26:51.577
And I do love Camden,

26:51.577 --> 26:53.879
so I'm not opposed to anything,
I'm really not.

26:53.879 --> 26:56.014
I got one question.
Hold on.

26:56.014 --> 26:59.618
I got one question. Mama,
will you be in the wedding?

26:59.618 --> 27:01.720
[all laugh]

27:01.720 --> 27:04.723
Well, with 40 Gs
in the Prada bag.

27:04.723 --> 27:08.660
[laughter and applause]

27:08.660 --> 27:12.364
Now, there was another
show-mance brewing.

27:12.364 --> 27:16.068
Jorgeous, I understand
you had your own secret crush?

27:16.068 --> 27:18.170
-What?
-Oh, my God.

27:18.170 --> 27:20.305
How are you just gonna
call me out like that?

27:20.305 --> 27:22.274
[all laugh]

27:22.274 --> 27:23.609
I'm sick of this reunion.

27:23.609 --> 27:25.744
[all laugh]

27:25.744 --> 27:27.613
Y'all are ho's.

27:27.613 --> 27:29.181
No, there was
a little show-mance

27:29.181 --> 27:33.285
that we did have
going on behind the scenes.

27:33.285 --> 27:37.256
It was-- It was me
and Miss Orion over there.

27:37.256 --> 27:40.659
You know,
when you're secluded

27:40.659 --> 27:42.895
and away from everybody,

27:42.895 --> 27:44.863
all you have
is, like, your sisters.

27:44.863 --> 27:48.367
And I saw the mullet
out of drag,

27:48.367 --> 27:51.003
and I was like, oh, okay, okay.

27:51.003 --> 27:53.005
Did anybody else
know about this?

27:53.005 --> 27:54.740
-Absolutely.
-Yeah.

27:54.740 --> 27:56.408
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

27:56.408 --> 27:58.210
-Kornbread, you knew about this?
-Oh, yeah, girl,

27:58.210 --> 27:59.945
'cause we was riding in the van
back to the hotel,

27:59.945 --> 28:01.480
and then I was sitting
next to Orion

28:01.480 --> 28:02.481
and Jorgeous
was in front of Orion.

28:02.481 --> 28:03.515
They were trying
to slip their hands

28:03.515 --> 28:04.783
through the little crack
to hold hands.

28:04.783 --> 28:07.352
And I'm a nosy bitch,
so I was, like, oh, girl,

28:07.352 --> 28:08.787
I see it brewing, bitch.

28:08.787 --> 28:10.556
-Okay.
-It was all fun.

28:10.556 --> 28:13.058
Like, we just hugged,
cuddled, hold hands.

28:13.058 --> 28:16.328
But it wasn't anything,
like, you know, crazy.

28:16.328 --> 28:18.430
-Like, no lips were touched.
-Oh, okay.

28:18.430 --> 28:22.000
So, Orion, did you two connect
after the season?

28:22.000 --> 28:24.169
I mean, it was
very short-lived,

28:24.169 --> 28:27.306
but, you know
I do love you, Jorgeous.

28:27.306 --> 28:28.440
I do. I love you, too.

28:28.440 --> 28:30.309
I do.
I will always love you,

28:30.309 --> 28:32.210
even if you don't respond
to my text messages.

28:32.210 --> 28:34.980
She doesn't respond to anybody's
text
messages. That's okay.

28:34.980 --> 28:37.215
To be fair,
it would be easier

28:37.215 --> 28:39.418
to get in touch with
the president than Jorgeous.

28:39.418 --> 28:42.354
-Literally.
-Girl, I'm so booked and busy

28:42.354 --> 28:44.890
I don't know what y'all
want me to do.

28:44.890 --> 28:46.625
I don't know
what y'all want me to do.

28:46.625 --> 28:49.428
All right. Now, listen,
show-mances come and go,

28:49.428 --> 28:51.530
but tattoos are forever

28:51.530 --> 28:55.033
in the case
of Kornbread and Willow Pill.

28:55.033 --> 28:56.468
-Take a look.
-Maybe.

28:56.468 --> 28:58.637
[cheering]

28:58.637 --> 29:00.539
I love that look.
That's so cute.

29:00.539 --> 29:02.541
-Wow!
-It looks just like her.

29:02.541 --> 29:03.942
-That's love, baby.
-It's beautiful.

29:03.942 --> 29:05.477
That's actually Willow's leg.

29:05.477 --> 29:06.845
[all laugh]

29:06.845 --> 29:08.680
Kornbread,
what am I looking at here?

29:08.680 --> 29:10.182
I got a tattoo of Willow.

29:10.182 --> 29:12.584
This is Willow's
arcade look that we did,

29:12.584 --> 29:13.752
one of my favorite looks
of hers.

29:13.752 --> 29:15.053
but this is the moment
where I was, like,

29:15.053 --> 29:16.355
I want to do
something meaningful,

29:16.355 --> 29:17.389
and one of the most
meaningful relationships

29:17.389 --> 29:19.257
I got out
of RuPaul's Drag Race

29:19.257 --> 29:21.259
was my relationship
with Willow.

29:21.259 --> 29:22.594
It's one of those things
to where

29:22.594 --> 29:24.730
you can find your soulmate
outside of a relationship,

29:24.730 --> 29:27.199
and I think that's what
we found via each other.

29:27.199 --> 29:28.767
Yes, yes. Willow,
what do you think about

29:28.767 --> 29:31.036
being a permanent part
of Kornbread?

29:31.036 --> 29:32.671
Oh, I love it so much.

29:32.671 --> 29:34.973
It's like so dear to my heart.

29:34.973 --> 29:37.309
And I'm going to get
her broken ankle on my ass.

29:37.309 --> 29:39.945
-[all laugh]
-Oh, my goodness.

29:39.945 --> 29:41.580
Well, I have
a confession to make.

29:41.580 --> 29:43.181
I have a tramp stamp.

29:43.181 --> 29:44.449
-Oh!
-Oh!

29:44.449 --> 29:45.917
Oh, dear Jesus.

29:45.917 --> 29:48.220
Oh, there it is.
[all laugh]

29:48.220 --> 29:49.321
Yes, baby.

29:49.321 --> 29:50.989
I gotta tell you,

29:50.989 --> 29:53.125
I love my tattoo of Michelle,

29:53.125 --> 29:55.394
and it's just like
the judges' table.

29:55.394 --> 29:56.962
I know she's there,

29:56.962 --> 29:58.997
but I never have to look at her.

29:58.997 --> 30:00.098
[all laugh]

30:02.234 --> 30:04.670
Welcome back.
Now, we're on the stage

30:04.670 --> 30:09.007
of RuPaul's Drag Race Live
from the Flamingo in Las Vegas.

30:09.007 --> 30:11.943
Next up,
I want to talk to the queen

30:11.943 --> 30:13.478
who caused a sensation.

30:13.478 --> 30:17.449
Our first straight drag queen,
Maddy Morphosis.

30:17.449 --> 30:19.117
-What?
-Aah!

30:19.117 --> 30:20.852
[laughs]

30:20.852 --> 30:25.057
Now, were you surprised
by the reaction from the fans?

30:25.057 --> 30:26.324
Going onto the show,
I knew there was going to be,

30:26.324 --> 30:28.026
like, some negativity,
some pushback.

30:28.026 --> 30:30.328
I didn't expect
the polarizing levels,

30:30.328 --> 30:31.563
especially, like, online.

30:31.563 --> 30:33.098
It's, like, wow,
we support this.

30:33.098 --> 30:34.533
This is amazing
and wonderful.

30:34.533 --> 30:36.034
And then another half
of the people

30:36.034 --> 30:39.071
were, like, this is the worst
thing to happen in drag history.

30:39.071 --> 30:40.605
But, I mean, like,
no matter what,

30:40.605 --> 30:42.307
I knew I had the support
of, like, this cast

30:42.307 --> 30:44.342
and I'm just really
appreciative of, like, them

30:44.342 --> 30:46.311
and all the people
that have supported me,

30:46.311 --> 30:47.813
like, up in my drag journey.

30:47.813 --> 30:49.247
Yeah, Angie, tell me why

30:49.247 --> 30:52.851
you were so behind
Maddy Morphosis.

30:53.085 --> 30:55.587
I believe in
all kinds of expression

30:55.587 --> 30:57.456
when it comes to drag,
and, like, seeing Maddy

30:57.456 --> 31:00.325
was something
that was so inspired to me.

31:00.325 --> 31:02.661
Now, I will say it was something
I had never heard of,

31:02.661 --> 31:04.229
and when I heard it
for the first time,

31:04.229 --> 31:06.932
I was, like, girl, what?

31:06.932 --> 31:09.735
Oh, okay. But I wanted
to get to know more of it.

31:09.735 --> 31:11.570
-I was like, okay.
-Sure. Yeah.

31:11.570 --> 31:12.704
Alyssa, what did you think?

31:12.704 --> 31:13.739
I need to support you.

31:13.739 --> 31:15.507
There's some people

31:15.507 --> 31:17.109
that they threw shade
about you in Twitter.

31:17.109 --> 31:19.111
But no matter what,
we are artists,

31:19.111 --> 31:20.645
and you are here
for a reason:

31:20.645 --> 31:23.115
to make a difference
in the world.

31:23.115 --> 31:26.351
So, Maddy, what do you hope
people have learned

31:26.351 --> 31:28.754
from your experience
on Drag Race?

31:28.754 --> 31:30.622
I've had a lot of people
in my inboxes or at shows

31:30.622 --> 31:32.124
tell me, like,
you're going to inspire

31:32.124 --> 31:33.792
so many other, like, straight
men
who want to do drag,

31:33.792 --> 31:35.460
and that's never
been my narrative.

31:35.460 --> 31:37.863
I've never been saying
everyone should do drag

31:37.863 --> 31:39.231
because I think a lot
of people shouldn't do drag.

31:39.231 --> 31:42.768
Drag is rooted in
queer culture, queer history.

31:42.768 --> 31:43.869
It's a queer art form,

31:43.869 --> 31:45.303
and if you are remotely,
like, homophobic,

31:45.303 --> 31:46.905
like, you have to work
on yourself first.

31:46.905 --> 31:49.207
And men should explore
their femininity.

31:49.207 --> 31:50.742
So many bad things
come from toxic masculinity:

31:50.742 --> 31:52.444
homophobia, transphobia.

31:52.444 --> 31:53.545
And I'm not gonna
change the world.

31:53.545 --> 31:56.081
I'm not gonna be
what brings the dam down.

31:56.081 --> 31:57.382
I'm just gonna be
another crack in it.

31:57.382 --> 31:58.550
-But you are part of it, baby.
-Amen.

31:58.550 --> 32:00.519
And I'm really excited
to be a part of the show

32:00.519 --> 32:02.988
and be a part of that history
and that change.

32:02.988 --> 32:05.123
Well, Maddy, you know
what kind of queen you are.

32:05.123 --> 32:07.659
You are a drama queen.

32:07.659 --> 32:09.327
[cheers and laughter]

32:09.327 --> 32:12.631
Let's check the receipts
in another...

32:15.934 --> 32:17.102
Take a look.

32:17.102 --> 32:18.804
This is the best part.

32:18.804 --> 32:22.641
I hope you give the second-best
lip sync of the night

32:22.641 --> 32:24.042
because, like,
I'm gonna do what I do.

32:24.042 --> 32:25.977
You think you're gonna
be first? Good luck.

32:25.977 --> 32:28.446
All tea, I'm not worried
about this lip sync.

32:28.446 --> 32:30.916
I do this on a daily basis
in New York City.

32:30.916 --> 32:32.617
This is my bread and butter,

32:32.617 --> 32:34.352
so, like, I'm not going in
with the mindset

32:34.352 --> 32:35.987
of, like,
worrying about Maddy

32:35.987 --> 32:37.022
or, like, worrying about
anybody else.

32:37.022 --> 32:39.057
-You should.
-I worry about myself.

32:39.057 --> 32:41.026
I should? About what?
All tea, girl.

32:41.026 --> 32:42.260
[laughs]

32:42.260 --> 32:44.429
She thinks because
she's from New York

32:44.429 --> 32:45.864
and she does this,

32:45.864 --> 32:47.199
she lives,
eats, breathes drag,

32:47.199 --> 32:51.970
that her drag is better
than everyone else's.

32:51.970 --> 32:53.338
Bitch, you in the bottom, too.

32:53.338 --> 32:55.073
Why is she
worried about me?

32:55.073 --> 32:56.374
You're in the bottom as well.

32:56.374 --> 32:57.442
That's why
you should be worried.

32:57.442 --> 32:58.810
I'm not worried
about you, though, girl,

32:58.810 --> 33:00.045
because what I'm selling
is not what you're selling.

33:00.045 --> 33:02.347
-That is the tea, okay?
-Oh, okay.

33:02.347 --> 33:03.481
I'm going to destroy you
in this lip sync.

33:03.481 --> 33:05.750
-It's not a problem.
-Okay.

33:05.750 --> 33:07.752
Have your moment.
Keep talking.

33:07.752 --> 33:08.787
You're talking a lot
more than me, you know,

33:08.787 --> 33:09.855
because
I'm usually the one--

33:09.855 --> 33:12.057
-Well, that's a change.
-Yes, it is.

33:12.057 --> 33:13.792
This is your moment.

33:13.792 --> 33:15.727
Have it!

33:15.727 --> 33:17.929
[all shouting]

33:17.929 --> 33:19.631
[all laugh]

33:19.631 --> 33:22.367
Oh, my goodness.

33:22.367 --> 33:24.202
So, Maddy,
what was going on?

33:24.202 --> 33:26.271
I couldn't 100% tell you.

33:26.271 --> 33:28.740
I had a couple cocktails
in Untucked.

33:28.740 --> 33:31.209
It was my second time
in the bottom.

33:31.209 --> 33:32.777
I honestly thought, like,
I was probably gonna go home,

33:32.777 --> 33:34.112
but I was just
gassing myself up.

33:34.112 --> 33:35.847
I was just like
I'm gonna slay this lip sync.

33:35.847 --> 33:37.482
It's gonna be great.
I'm gonna do wonderful.

33:37.482 --> 33:39.251
And then, like,
whenever she came in,

33:39.251 --> 33:41.319
she was just saying, like, oh,
well, I'm not worried about you.

33:41.319 --> 33:43.188
What you're selling
is not what I'm selling.

33:43.188 --> 33:44.422
And in that moment,

33:44.422 --> 33:45.924
it felt, like, almost like
either disrespectful

33:45.924 --> 33:47.292
or that she was just
trying to have,

33:47.292 --> 33:48.693
like, an Untucked moment.

33:48.693 --> 33:49.694
And I'm, like, well, I'm
probably gonna go home anyway,

33:49.694 --> 33:50.996
so let's just have this moment.

33:50.996 --> 33:53.298
It's our moment.
Let's have it, you know.

33:53.298 --> 33:54.332
Let's have it
together.

33:54.332 --> 33:56.601
Kerri, what
did you think of this?

33:56.601 --> 33:58.103
Baby, this
was so much fun.

33:58.103 --> 34:00.605
You got Miss Mouth Almighty
and Mr. Straight,

34:00.605 --> 34:02.674
honey, you know
it's gonna be something fierce.

34:02.674 --> 34:04.876
Yeah, yeah,
it may not be Mr. Clean,

34:04.876 --> 34:06.344
but it's Mr. Straight.

34:06.344 --> 34:07.879
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[all laugh]

34:07.879 --> 34:10.215
And I was living for it.

34:10.215 --> 34:13.685
I think she thought that I was
being disrespectful towards her.

34:13.685 --> 34:15.086
I felt she was being
dismissive towards me.

34:15.086 --> 34:17.422
We started to have a fight.

34:17.422 --> 34:19.090
It went off the rails entirely.

34:19.090 --> 34:20.725
Jasmine,
what do you have to say?

34:20.725 --> 34:21.693
I think it was a lot
of miscommunication

34:21.693 --> 34:22.727
on both of our parts

34:22.727 --> 34:24.896
that we heard something
the wrong way

34:24.896 --> 34:26.564
or we took it the wrong way.

34:26.564 --> 34:28.500
But the only thing
I want to let you know,

34:28.500 --> 34:32.003
I didn't mean it as if,
like, I'm from New York City

34:32.003 --> 34:33.738
like, New York City
is the best thing.

34:33.738 --> 34:34.806
No, bitch,
that's just my postal code.

34:34.806 --> 34:36.141
Like, that's where
I get my mail.

34:36.141 --> 34:37.309
That's all I meant by it,

34:37.309 --> 34:38.310
and I don't want
you to think

34:38.310 --> 34:39.344
that I was
looking down on you.

34:39.344 --> 34:42.147
I just have the utmost
respect for you.

34:42.147 --> 34:44.015
And also, you took my call
when I first got home

34:44.015 --> 34:45.250
because I felt bad,
I mean, you know?

34:45.250 --> 34:46.618
You listened to me
and things like that.

34:46.618 --> 34:48.053
So, like, I appreciate it.

34:48.053 --> 34:50.522
Ooh, I know
that was a long phone call, too.

34:50.522 --> 34:51.589
[laughs]

34:51.589 --> 34:53.024
Yes.

34:53.024 --> 34:54.326
Willow,
what did you think of this?

34:54.326 --> 34:55.627
This was the moment
that I realized

34:55.627 --> 34:57.862
I was on RuPaul's Drag Race.

34:57.862 --> 35:01.099
I was, like, oh, my God,
I'm on the show.

35:01.099 --> 35:04.002
And I quote every part
of that conversation.

35:04.002 --> 35:05.904
You know,
I say I wipe my ass

35:05.904 --> 35:07.672
on a daily basis
in New York City.

35:07.672 --> 35:10.976
[all laugh]
I did say that.

35:10.976 --> 35:12.544
Now, Jasmine,
you had one of the most

35:12.544 --> 35:14.913
emotional moments of the season

35:14.913 --> 35:18.616
when you shared your truth
in an episode of Untucked.

35:18.616 --> 35:20.285
Let's take a look.

35:20.285 --> 35:22.253
[exhales]

35:23.755 --> 35:25.724
Before coming here...

35:25.724 --> 35:27.325
Oh, my God.

35:28.626 --> 35:30.628
Let the emotions flow, baby.

35:30.628 --> 35:32.597
[cries]

35:32.597 --> 35:34.065
Yeah, I need your hands.

35:34.065 --> 35:35.834
[sobs]

35:35.834 --> 35:40.071
Before coming here,
I was about to start hormones,

35:40.071 --> 35:41.573
and coming here,
I was scared

35:41.573 --> 35:44.342
and I didn't want to have to
go through that process

35:44.342 --> 35:46.044
while going through this.

35:46.044 --> 35:49.347
But, like, seeing Kerri,

35:49.347 --> 35:52.317
seeing how confident she is
in who she is,

35:52.317 --> 35:56.354
it just, like,
further, like, affirmed,

35:56.354 --> 35:58.590
like, what I've been
feeling my whole life.

35:58.590 --> 36:01.559
Like, I as well, like,

36:01.559 --> 36:03.194
I definitely do, like, feel

36:03.194 --> 36:07.232
that, like, I am trans.

36:07.232 --> 36:10.335
[sobs]

36:10.335 --> 36:13.271
And I've been
so scared to say it.

36:13.271 --> 36:17.409
I have held back
from it for so long

36:17.409 --> 36:21.312
because I didn't want
to hurt my Dad.

36:21.312 --> 36:25.683
I'm, like, I can't lie
about it anymore.

36:27.052 --> 36:29.954
I am trans.

36:29.954 --> 36:32.757
How do you feel
having just said that?

36:32.757 --> 36:35.627
Happy.

36:35.627 --> 36:39.397
You owe it to yourself
to be happy

36:39.397 --> 36:41.032
and to live your life

36:41.032 --> 36:44.202
as the human being
that you want to be.

36:44.202 --> 36:47.539
-That puts the T in the LGBTQ.
-Yeah.

36:47.539 --> 36:48.773
-It is a family.
-Yes.

36:51.910 --> 36:53.711
-Whoo.
-Wow.

36:53.711 --> 36:55.513
Jesus, honey.
[applause]

36:56.915 --> 36:59.884
Jasmine, what prompted
all of that to come out?

37:01.920 --> 37:04.589
Kerri and I had a conversation
a couple days before,

37:04.589 --> 37:07.559
and, like, I just felt,
like, welcomed

37:07.559 --> 37:09.294
and, like, I finally feel like

37:09.294 --> 37:11.062
I, like, fought
that, like, oh, I'm annoying,

37:11.062 --> 37:12.097
yadda, yadda, yadda.

37:12.097 --> 37:14.466
I can, like,
finally be myself.

37:17.869 --> 37:19.070
It's okay, baby.
Let it flow.

37:19.070 --> 37:22.240
Watching it back,
it's very hard to watch it

37:22.240 --> 37:24.409
because I bring up my Dad

37:24.409 --> 37:25.877
and I don't ever
want him to feel

37:25.877 --> 37:29.481
as if I'm taking him down.

37:29.481 --> 37:32.183
Mm, mm, mm.

37:32.183 --> 37:35.186
I didn't tell him
until the day of the episode.

37:35.186 --> 37:37.555
And I was really nervous,

37:37.555 --> 37:40.592
but I came out to him,
and he was just, like,

37:40.592 --> 37:42.660
"Okay, I'll call you tomorrow."

37:42.660 --> 37:43.962
And I was just, like...

37:47.198 --> 37:47.932
You're beautiful.

37:47.932 --> 37:49.501
I'm happy to say

37:49.501 --> 37:53.037
that everything has gone
where I want it to go

37:53.037 --> 37:55.507
with my relationship,
with my family,

37:55.507 --> 37:57.108
with everything, you know.

37:57.108 --> 37:59.477
But...

37:59.477 --> 38:01.513
I'm happy it's done

38:01.513 --> 38:06.384
because I have finally
started, like,

38:06.384 --> 38:08.720
being okay with
where I'm at as a person.

38:08.720 --> 38:10.688
And, like,
I'm still processing it

38:10.688 --> 38:12.490
but, like, holy fuck.

38:12.490 --> 38:15.994
Like, I put myself
out there in a way

38:15.994 --> 38:18.296
I don't think
I ever knew I could.

38:18.296 --> 38:19.964
-I'm happy I said it,
-Yeah.

38:19.964 --> 38:22.634
because I don't have
to live in fear of it anymore.

38:22.634 --> 38:24.736
Yeah. And, Kerri,
what was going through your head

38:24.736 --> 38:25.770
when you heard this?

38:25.770 --> 38:27.539
Another one?
Thank you.

38:27.539 --> 38:28.840
[all laugh]

38:28.840 --> 38:30.308
No, no, no.

38:30.308 --> 38:32.410
Whoo.

38:32.410 --> 38:33.578
But in all serious,

38:33.578 --> 38:35.246
it was just
such a beautiful moment,

38:35.246 --> 38:37.549
and I knew
that in that moment,

38:37.549 --> 38:39.417
family is so important

38:39.417 --> 38:42.053
and sisterhood is so important.

38:42.053 --> 38:45.924
And I was, like, we're going
to dive into the heart space

38:45.924 --> 38:48.393
and get what
really needs to be there

38:48.393 --> 38:50.094
to flow forward,

38:50.094 --> 38:51.829
because that's how,
as you say,

38:51.829 --> 38:53.364
the beginning
of the rest of your life starts.

38:53.364 --> 38:56.935
It comes with
confirmation inside yourself,

38:56.935 --> 38:58.336
and then it flows outward.

38:58.336 --> 38:59.671
And I feel like
a lot of time

38:59.671 --> 39:02.974
when I'm in my, you know,
cities visiting people,

39:02.974 --> 39:05.076
many, many, many
of my beautiful angels

39:05.076 --> 39:08.146
that visit me are either trans,
figuring themselves out,

39:08.146 --> 39:09.247
parents of trans people.

39:09.247 --> 39:10.682
And it's so emotional

39:10.682 --> 39:12.650
because I'm able to give

39:12.650 --> 39:14.752
what I always wish
I would have had.

39:14.752 --> 39:17.121
Absolutely, because
you living your truth

39:17.121 --> 39:20.124
has prompted other people
to say, you know what?

39:20.124 --> 39:21.693
I think I can do it, too.

39:21.693 --> 39:24.462
And I don't get emotional a lot,

39:24.462 --> 39:28.466
but every time I do
get emotional,

39:28.466 --> 39:31.769
honestly, it's because
what I think of my girls,

39:31.769 --> 39:33.404
my beautiful angels,

39:33.404 --> 39:37.575
I really am reminded at just
how proud I am of all of y'all.

39:37.575 --> 39:39.244
Each one of you
owns yourself

39:39.244 --> 39:40.612
and especially you, Jasmine,

39:40.612 --> 39:42.447
you put yourself out there.

39:42.447 --> 39:44.449
You talked about who you are,

39:44.449 --> 39:46.818
and then to see
who you are today.

39:46.818 --> 39:48.953
For you to look
every day in the mirror,

39:48.953 --> 39:51.256
I'm sure you feel
so much relief and happiness.

39:51.256 --> 39:54.158
You're able
to live authentically,

39:54.158 --> 39:56.561
and it really
makes me have so much joy

39:56.561 --> 39:58.796
to wake up every day
and that be the reality.

39:58.796 --> 40:00.331
Yeah. Amen.

40:00.331 --> 40:02.900
Now, after Season 14
completed filming,

40:02.900 --> 40:06.271
Bosco, Kornbread,
and Willow Pill

40:06.271 --> 40:07.839
have come out as trans.

40:07.839 --> 40:09.240
Yes!
[cheers and applause]

40:09.240 --> 40:11.376
It's the most
trans-tastic season, baby.

40:11.376 --> 40:12.644
Yes, it is.

40:12.644 --> 40:15.880
So, Bosco, how has
this experience been for you?

40:15.880 --> 40:18.316
It's been so cool.

40:18.316 --> 40:22.987
Verbalizing it has given me
so much support from the fans.

40:22.987 --> 40:24.689
Even, like,
a silly little comment

40:24.689 --> 40:27.659
where, like, somebody's,
like, he looks X, Y, and Z,

40:27.659 --> 40:29.594
and then they'll be, like,
a comment underneath, "she."

40:29.594 --> 40:30.595
Like, even if
they agreed with it,

40:30.595 --> 40:31.696
like, they still have my back.

40:31.696 --> 40:34.265
They, like, are
meeting me where I'm at.

40:34.265 --> 40:37.068
And, like,
having that behind me

40:37.068 --> 40:39.137
to, like, keep
pushing me forward

40:39.137 --> 40:41.172
has been so helpful.

40:41.172 --> 40:44.609
And they say, like,
no, "she" bombed Snatch Game.

40:44.609 --> 40:47.078
She. She.
[all laugh]

40:47.078 --> 40:49.213
Maddy, what a read.

40:49.213 --> 40:50.848
Kornbread, what about you?

40:50.848 --> 40:52.550
What's your experience
been like?

40:52.550 --> 40:54.352
It was not the easiest,
honestly.

40:54.352 --> 40:55.687
I'm gonna be truthful with you.

40:55.687 --> 40:58.690
I think I was afraid
to do it on the show

40:58.690 --> 41:00.858
because I haven't talked
to anybody in my family yet,

41:00.858 --> 41:02.427
and I had to get home
and deal with that.

41:02.427 --> 41:04.495
It was very, very rough
in the beginning,

41:04.495 --> 41:05.596
but I had to do it.

41:05.596 --> 41:07.632
I couldn't preach
about loving myself

41:07.632 --> 41:10.134
if I wasn't truly loving myself
and being open about it.

41:10.134 --> 41:12.070
-That's right.
-So everybody say love.

41:12.070 --> 41:14.205
Everybody say love.

41:14.205 --> 41:15.673
Willow, tell me
about your experience.

41:15.673 --> 41:18.343
It's been difficult. I feel,
like, for the longest time

41:18.343 --> 41:21.045
I just wasn't letting myself
know myself at all,

41:21.045 --> 41:24.716
and this feels like
the final chapter

41:24.716 --> 41:25.917
to getting to know me.

41:25.917 --> 41:28.119
And now we, like, sit here

41:28.119 --> 41:30.888
so much, like,
prouder and happier

41:30.888 --> 41:32.590
and our cheeks
a lot more full.

41:32.590 --> 41:36.561
I was gonna say, baby,
she is snatched as ever, bitch.

41:36.561 --> 41:37.762
You see that face?

41:37.762 --> 41:40.198
[all laugh]

41:40.198 --> 41:43.735
There's such a sisterhood
of the traveling estrogens.

41:43.735 --> 41:46.204
[all laugh]

41:46.204 --> 41:47.572
I love it.

41:47.572 --> 41:49.307
Well, queens,
you are all my teachers.

41:49.307 --> 41:51.776
Thank you.
We'll be right back after this.

41:52.009 --> 41:53.845
♪ Moulin Ru ♪

41:53.845 --> 41:55.246
Welcome back.

41:55.246 --> 41:57.215
Now, when it came
to Moulin Ru,

41:57.215 --> 42:01.486
the real drama started
before rehearsals even began.

42:01.486 --> 42:04.188
Let's take
a look at another what?

42:04.188 --> 42:07.725
All: Clash of the Queens.

42:07.725 --> 42:09.627
I want Saltine.

42:09.627 --> 42:11.195
I also want Saltine.

42:11.195 --> 42:14.031
It feels, like,
very much my vibe.

42:14.031 --> 42:17.935
I embody Saltine, and I am also
putting my foot down for her.

42:17.935 --> 42:20.204
Okay, yes,
there is a sexiness to it,

42:20.204 --> 42:22.840
but I feel like I showed
the other side of Saltine,

42:22.840 --> 42:24.776
which is the romance
and the love story.

42:24.776 --> 42:26.277
And I feel like
I proved that to the judges

42:26.277 --> 42:28.746
as I beat you
in the lip sync.

42:28.746 --> 42:30.148
That is a good point.

42:30.148 --> 42:33.384
Do you think you would
have beaten me in Swept Away?

42:33.384 --> 42:34.652
Yes, I do.

42:34.652 --> 42:37.288
Mm. That's a bold opinion.

42:37.288 --> 42:38.489
Yeah.

42:38.489 --> 42:41.392
It's okay
to be wrong sometimes.

42:41.392 --> 42:43.995
I know that she wants me
to be knocked down a peg

42:43.995 --> 42:46.397
so that I will crumble
and give her the part,

42:46.397 --> 42:47.498
and that's not happening.

42:47.498 --> 42:48.900
Saltine has loads of lines,

42:48.900 --> 42:50.568
and I feel like I'm gonna
have no problem with that.

42:50.568 --> 42:52.503
You sure aren't, because
you're not gonna have them.

42:54.238 --> 42:57.308
I'm getting the role
of fucking Saltine,

42:57.308 --> 42:58.543
and they're going
to have to drag

42:58.543 --> 43:00.044
my goddamn body
out of here

43:00.044 --> 43:01.579
before I leave without it.

43:01.579 --> 43:04.015
You know what?
Fuck all of you.

43:04.015 --> 43:05.149
God.

43:05.149 --> 43:06.951
You better
fucking turn this shit out

43:06.951 --> 43:08.252
and if you don't,
I'm gonna be pissed

43:08.252 --> 43:09.454
because I wanted that part.

43:12.690 --> 43:14.392
I am sweating.

43:14.392 --> 43:18.029
So, Bosco, do you think
you may have fought too hard

43:18.029 --> 43:19.764
for the role of Saltine?

43:19.764 --> 43:21.265
No.

43:21.265 --> 43:23.835
I don't feel

43:23.835 --> 43:26.704
like I said anything
that was out of line.

43:26.704 --> 43:28.039
I don't think
I was nice about it,

43:28.039 --> 43:29.273
and I take responsibility

43:29.273 --> 43:30.775
for being a huge bitch
in the moment.

43:30.775 --> 43:32.643
But I don't know
where we decided

43:32.643 --> 43:34.846
that drag queens
aren't huge bitches,

43:34.846 --> 43:37.081
like, 90% of the time.

43:37.081 --> 43:39.317
I've seen girls
ask for a drink more mean

43:39.317 --> 43:40.918
than I asked for that part.

43:40.918 --> 43:43.521
So I really wanted it,
so I fought for it,

43:43.521 --> 43:46.190
and it didn't work out for me,
so whatever. [laughs]

43:46.190 --> 43:48.693
It just kind of felt
like Camden was really, like,

43:48.693 --> 43:50.294
this is why I'm gonna
be good at this role,

43:50.294 --> 43:51.662
and I think
that you were, like,

43:51.662 --> 43:53.231
no, this is why you're not
gonna be good at this role.

43:53.231 --> 43:54.565
So I think that's where

43:54.565 --> 43:56.367
I was kind of getting
that vibe a little bit.

43:56.367 --> 43:57.935
I could see that.

43:57.935 --> 44:01.105
I did absolutely come off
more aggressively

44:01.105 --> 44:03.007
and will completely
own up to that.

44:03.007 --> 44:06.010
All right. Lady Camden,
what do you think?

44:06.010 --> 44:07.445
I mean, I just felt like

44:07.445 --> 44:09.847
the feedback I had gotten from
the judges and from everyone

44:09.847 --> 44:11.249
was that I needed
to stand up for myself,

44:11.249 --> 44:12.383
and I'm glad that I did,

44:12.383 --> 44:13.985
even though
I didn't win the fight.

44:13.985 --> 44:15.119
And it worked out.

-Because it did.
-Yes, it did.

incredibly talented,

51:26.250 --> 51:27.418
[all laugh]

51:27.418 --> 51:29.753
And my good sis Kornbread.

51:29.753 --> 51:30.888
Let's hear it, bitch.

51:30.888 --> 51:32.022
I know you love the Mayflower

51:32.022 --> 51:33.557
because you always wear
them Pilgrim pumps.

51:33.557 --> 51:34.959
-Oh!
-Ooh!

51:34.959 --> 51:36.327
Speaking of my Pilgrim pumps,

51:36.327 --> 51:38.829
didn't your shoes come off
when you lost that lip sync?

51:38.829 --> 51:40.464
Okay. Speaking of things
that RuPaul said,

51:40.464 --> 51:43.367
In your zebra look,
she said busting out all over.

51:43.367 --> 51:44.768
That wasn't
a pop culture reference.

51:44.768 --> 51:46.270
She was talking about
your ill-fitting costumes

51:46.270 --> 51:47.338
like your entrance look.

51:47.338 --> 51:48.706
-Oh!
-Ooh!

51:48.706 --> 51:52.309
She ain't even putting
the glasses on, bitch.

51:52.309 --> 51:55.079
Okay. Orion Story,
assume the position.

51:55.079 --> 51:57.114
Okay.

51:57.114 --> 52:00.651
June Jambalaya, you know,

52:00.651 --> 52:02.019
I know you said
that you were top,

52:02.019 --> 52:03.988
but you're really good
at being in the bottom.

52:03.988 --> 52:05.356
With you, boo?

52:05.356 --> 52:07.491
[all laugh]

52:07.491 --> 52:10.561
Kornbread,
the snack that smiles back.

52:10.561 --> 52:11.695
Let's hear it, bitch.

52:11.695 --> 52:13.664
You know, a little known
fact about--

52:13.664 --> 52:15.432
an unknown fact
about Kornbread actually

52:15.432 --> 52:17.501
is that she's
the only person in history

52:17.501 --> 52:20.738
to ever out-pizza the Hut.

52:20.738 --> 52:22.006
I do what?

52:22.006 --> 52:24.208
Out-pizza--
out-pizza the Hut.

52:24.208 --> 52:26.477
You wanna try
that one again?

52:26.477 --> 52:28.579
I'm good.

52:28.579 --> 52:30.014
[all laugh]

52:30.014 --> 52:31.382
Orion, how's your last
name gonna be Story?

52:31.382 --> 52:32.616
You can't even read.

52:32.616 --> 52:34.551
-Oh!
-Oh, my God.

52:34.551 --> 52:37.388
And finally, Kornbread.

52:37.388 --> 52:38.856
DeJa Skye.

52:38.856 --> 52:40.591
Everyone in the season
said you're helpful.

52:40.591 --> 52:44.595
You do everything for them.
You remind them of Jesus.

52:44.595 --> 52:46.330
You and Jesus have
something in common.

52:46.330 --> 52:47.798
You both have 12 followers.

52:47.798 --> 52:50.234
[all laugh]

52:50.234 --> 52:54.571
It is 13 as of yesterday,
thank you.

52:54.571 --> 52:56.807
Okay, ladies,
that's quite enough.

52:56.807 --> 52:59.610
The library
is closed officially.

52:59.610 --> 53:02.880
However, the RuPaul's
Drag Race Live gift shop

53:02.880 --> 53:07.418
is currently open in the lobby
of the Flamingo Las Vegas.

53:07.418 --> 53:10.154
Well, queens,
this is your last chance.

53:10.154 --> 53:13.991
Do you have anything you'd
like to get off your chesticles?

53:13.991 --> 53:15.659
Yeah, I do.

53:15.659 --> 53:19.163
And, you know, moving forward
and past all of this

53:19.163 --> 53:21.098
and everything that's
happened throughout the season,

53:21.098 --> 53:23.500
Jasmine, I know
I picked at you a lot,

53:23.500 --> 53:26.170
and I've maybe said
some hurtful things.

53:26.170 --> 53:28.872
And Jorgeous,
I know that I haven't been

53:28.872 --> 53:30.307
the most kind to you as well,

53:30.307 --> 53:33.210
and I wish that maybe I would
have went about it differently.

53:33.210 --> 53:35.379
But if there's anybody
that wants to talk to me,

53:35.379 --> 53:37.281
my phone
is literally always on.

53:37.281 --> 53:41.085
And I don't know how
necessarily you feel about me,

53:41.085 --> 53:44.421
but I will always consider you
all my sisters regardless.

53:44.421 --> 53:47.958
Real family fights,
you know, real sisters,

53:47.958 --> 53:50.694
-WWE Smackdown all the time.
-Boom!

53:50.694 --> 53:52.229
So just know, I really do--

53:52.229 --> 53:54.298
and honestly and from
the bottom of my heart,

53:54.298 --> 53:55.499
I appreciate you.
I adore you.

53:55.499 --> 53:57.634
I look up to you both
for separate reasons.

53:57.634 --> 53:59.703
I just wanna say
thank you

53:59.703 --> 54:02.039
because it really does take
a lot to, like, own up to that.

54:02.039 --> 54:05.542
But I just wanna say
now watching it now,

54:05.542 --> 54:08.946
I don't need no validation
from any-fucking-body.

54:08.946 --> 54:11.181
I still got that check.

54:11.181 --> 54:12.583
[cheering]

54:12.583 --> 54:14.751
And you're the only bitch
that can rock a napkin, baby.

54:14.751 --> 54:17.087
-Yes!
-[laughs]

54:17.087 --> 54:18.388
And I appreciate it
and thank you.

54:18.388 --> 54:22.993
And I know I went
a little crazy earlier.

54:22.993 --> 54:25.229
It's just we haven't
ever had this conversation yet,

54:25.229 --> 54:27.498
to be honest about it,
and I do have

54:27.498 --> 54:28.966
a ton amount of respect for you.

54:28.966 --> 54:30.868
I just feel like me and you
have to get to a place

54:30.868 --> 54:32.336
where we can communicate better,

54:32.336 --> 54:34.838
and I think that's
just going to take some time.

54:34.838 --> 54:36.940
All right, anybody else
have anything?

54:36.940 --> 54:38.375
If I could say something.

54:38.375 --> 54:40.911
I don't want to be saying
anything too disparaging

54:40.911 --> 54:42.546
about the show and about you,

54:42.546 --> 54:44.615
but the fact that

54:44.615 --> 54:47.417
you put two design challenges
so close together...

54:47.417 --> 54:48.852
[all laugh]

54:48.852 --> 54:51.622
It just reads as blatant
heterophobia honestly.

54:51.622 --> 54:53.857
And then to follow it up

54:53.857 --> 54:56.126
with an over the top
acting challenge

54:56.126 --> 54:57.594
with fart jokes
and Southern accents

54:57.594 --> 55:00.063
and I was excluded from that?

55:00.063 --> 55:01.598
No, you're right.

55:01.598 --> 55:04.434
That was the intersection
of homophobia and racism.

55:04.434 --> 55:06.236
[cheers and applause]

55:06.236 --> 55:10.040
I accept all blame for that.
I really do.

55:10.040 --> 55:13.010
[laughs]
We'll be right back.

55:13.010 --> 55:14.945
[all laugh]

55:15.379 --> 55:16.580
♪ Oh, baby ♪

55:16.580 --> 55:19.249
Welcome back
to RuPaul's Drag Race Reunited.

55:19.249 --> 55:23.020
Now, with one week until
we crown ourselves a winner,

55:23.020 --> 55:25.289
let's check in
with our top five.

55:25.289 --> 55:29.860
Ladies, tell us what
your high and low moment

55:29.860 --> 55:31.562
from the season was,

55:31.562 --> 55:35.065
starting with
Angeria Paris VanMichaels.

55:35.065 --> 55:38.735
I think my lowest point
of the entire competition

55:38.735 --> 55:42.339
was doing Tammy Brown
and just knowing

55:42.339 --> 55:45.209
that RuPaul
was gonna laugh at my jokes,

55:45.209 --> 55:47.010
and she did not.

55:47.010 --> 55:49.780
And when she did,
she was just laughing

55:49.780 --> 55:52.082
because she didn't know what
the fuck I was talking about.

55:52.082 --> 55:55.485
-Mm, yes.
-Thank you, Wanda Sykes.

55:55.485 --> 55:56.887
And what was your high?

55:56.887 --> 56:00.557
My highest point
was also involving RuPaul,

56:00.557 --> 56:02.492
when she told me, you know,

56:02.492 --> 56:06.096
I really didn't expect
all of this from you.

56:06.096 --> 56:08.799
And I went,
what does that say about me?

56:08.799 --> 56:10.767
She must have looked
at my audition,

56:10.767 --> 56:14.037
and said, bitch,
she ain't fittin' to be nothin'.

56:14.037 --> 56:15.872
[laughs] Oh, no, no.

56:15.872 --> 56:18.075
You've heard me
talk to you about this.

56:18.075 --> 56:20.644
I was very impressed
with your performance.

56:20.644 --> 56:22.412
No, it's all--
Mama, you know--

56:22.412 --> 56:24.381
Look, it meant the world to me

56:24.381 --> 56:26.083
because I never thought
in a million years

56:26.083 --> 56:27.951
that I was gonna be able
to come into this competition

56:27.951 --> 56:29.519
and impress you
the way that I did.

56:29.519 --> 56:30.520
So I'll take it.

56:30.520 --> 56:31.855
And slay, bitch.

56:31.855 --> 56:32.990
-Yeah!
-You did.

56:32.990 --> 56:36.593
All right, up next, Bosco.
Low and high.

56:36.593 --> 56:40.430
Low definitely
when every contestant,

56:40.430 --> 56:43.400
every judge, RuPaul,
the camera operator,

56:43.400 --> 56:47.437
the person signing the checks,
and the PAs told me to go home.

56:47.437 --> 56:49.506
That was a little rough.

56:49.506 --> 56:52.075
But I think the highs

56:52.075 --> 56:54.077
are definitely every time
I had the opportunity

56:54.077 --> 56:57.047
to shit-talk my fellow
competitors and win.

56:57.047 --> 56:58.649
And what?

56:58.649 --> 57:01.852
All right,
Daya Betty, same question.

57:01.852 --> 57:06.223
Low point definitely
being sent home my first week.

57:06.223 --> 57:08.191
Well, shit.

57:08.191 --> 57:09.326
And then my high point

57:09.326 --> 57:11.862
would have to actually also be

57:11.862 --> 57:13.830
being sent home my first week.

57:13.830 --> 57:17.367
I think it really re-lit
that fire under my ass

57:17.367 --> 57:19.836
and made me feel like
I had something to prove,

57:19.836 --> 57:21.104
and I think I did.

57:21.104 --> 57:22.572
I'm sitting up here
in the top five, and I'm...

57:22.572 --> 57:24.374
You know, I'm very proud.

57:24.374 --> 57:26.243
-I'm very proud.
-I love that.

57:26.243 --> 57:27.978
You know, sometimes
your lowest points

57:27.978 --> 57:31.648
become the catalyst
to move you forward, you know.

57:31.648 --> 57:32.783
100%.

57:32.783 --> 57:34.985
All right, Lady Camden,
what was your low point?

57:34.985 --> 57:36.953
I think my low point
was watching myself

57:36.953 --> 57:38.322
in the Girl Group Challenge

57:38.322 --> 57:42.059
in a bob
with a huge underlash

57:42.059 --> 57:43.794
and too much white eyeliner.

57:43.794 --> 57:45.996
And then realizing
that I looked the spitting image

57:45.996 --> 57:48.365
of the old man
from Family Guy.

57:48.365 --> 57:51.234
Do you guys know
the old creepy neighbor?

57:51.234 --> 57:53.103
"Hi, kids."

57:53.103 --> 57:54.304
In drag.

57:54.304 --> 57:57.007
I literally looked
exactly like that,

57:57.007 --> 57:58.975
and it will forever
fucking stay with me.

57:58.975 --> 58:01.111
[all laugh]

58:01.111 --> 58:04.047
It's true, though.
It's true.

58:04.047 --> 58:06.183
-It's really devastating.
-I can't un-see that now.

58:06.183 --> 58:07.551
I love that.

58:07.551 --> 58:09.453
So that was the low point.
I'm not gonna lie.

58:09.453 --> 58:11.121
What was your high point?

58:11.121 --> 58:13.323
Throughout the competition,
I felt very underestimated,

58:13.323 --> 58:15.459
and to win three challenges

58:15.459 --> 58:18.862
and to impress Ru
and impress the judges

58:18.862 --> 58:21.365
in a way that I think
maybe surprised you guys

58:21.365 --> 58:23.633
was just like a really,
really big moment in my life,

58:23.633 --> 58:25.135
and I will never forget it.

58:25.135 --> 58:26.670
-Yes, sister.
-Maxine!

58:26.670 --> 58:29.373
-Maxine!
-Maxine!

58:29.373 --> 58:31.375
And also meeting Angeria.

58:31.375 --> 58:32.809
-Aw.
-Aw.

58:32.809 --> 58:36.646
And finally, Willow Pill.
What was your low point?

58:36.646 --> 58:38.014
I think honestly
my low point

58:38.014 --> 58:39.783
was when Kornbread left,

58:39.783 --> 58:41.451
and it's not because
I love Kornbread.

58:41.451 --> 58:43.286
It's just because I hate
everyone else so much.

58:43.286 --> 58:44.421
[all laugh]

58:44.421 --> 58:46.556
She said the one person,
the one person.

58:46.556 --> 58:51.027
And my high point
was Spaghetti Bathgate,

58:51.027 --> 58:54.331
because I've just always
wanted to get on that runway

58:54.331 --> 58:56.433
and defile the stage,
and I did that.

58:56.433 --> 58:58.468
[all laugh]

58:58.468 --> 58:59.636
Well, thank you, ladies.

58:59.636 --> 59:02.906
Now, the winner
of RuPaul's Drag Race

59:02.906 --> 59:04.307
will receive a one year supply

59:04.307 --> 59:06.476
of Anastasia Beverly Hills
cosmetics

59:06.476 --> 59:13.617
and a cash prize of $100.000
powered by Cash App.

59:13.617 --> 59:16.520
Next week, our queens
will compete for the top spot

59:16.520 --> 59:19.122
as they perform
showstopping solo numbers.

59:19.122 --> 59:21.425
And in the end,

59:21.425 --> 59:24.561
two queens will go
head to head and toe to toe

59:24.561 --> 59:27.397
in a lip sync smackdown
for the crown.

59:27.397 --> 59:29.766
Fans, who do you think

59:29.766 --> 59:32.235
should be America's
next drag superstar?

59:32.235 --> 59:34.671
Are you team Angeria,

59:34.671 --> 59:36.473
Team Bosco,

59:36.473 --> 59:38.341
Team Daya Betty,

59:51.788 --> 59:53.490
at the Flamingo Las Vegas.

59:53.490 --> 59:55.826
And remember,
if you can't love yourself,

59:55.826 --> 59:57.594
how in the hell
you gonna love somebody else?

59:57.594 --> 59:59.162
Can I get an "amen" up in here?

59:59.162 --> 1:00:00.363
-Amen!
-Amen!

1:00:00.363 --> 1:00:02.732
All right.
