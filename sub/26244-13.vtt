I can fix that.

You both need to sign
a Disappointment Deferral Agreement.

that address hidden resentments

Here we are, all cozy, and poor Tontu
is out there in the rain with that thing.

My guess is that thing
is actually a barghest.

Barghests usually live
deep in the mountains.

12:25.786 --> 12:29.248
<i>I came down to see what was going on,</i>
<i>and there he was.</i>

12:29.331 --> 12:32.543
<i>He'd ransacked the whole place</i>
<i>looking for something to steal.</i>

12:33.127 --> 12:36.005
<i>He must have gotten bored with</i>
<i>all the things he'd swiped over the years</i>

12:36.088 --> 12:37.965
<i>because that was everywhere, too.</i>

12:38.507 --> 12:41.427
That's why I said I had
so much junk for your jumble sale.

12:41.510 --> 12:43.512
I mean, donations.

12:43.596 --> 12:46.056
Thank you very much for your time, ma'am.

12:50.060 --> 12:53.564
-[clattering]
-[voice murmuring]

12:54.315 --> 12:56.859
-[Hilda] Tontu!
-[Tontu] Oh, hello.

12:56.942 --> 12:59.278
Oh, so you're fine.
I've been so worried.

13:02.490 --> 13:04.450
Oh, you don't even care.

13:10.956 --> 13:13.209
[Tontu] Can't believe your mum
let you go out on your own

13:13.292 --> 13:14.752
with that monster on the loose.

13:14.835 --> 13:17.171
It's not a monster. It's a barghest.

13:17.254 --> 13:20.216
And Mum thinks I'm getting a lift
to the ceremony with David and Frida.

13:20.299 --> 13:22.885
I couldn't bring myself to tell her
that I'm not getting any badges

13:22.968 --> 13:24.845
because of you, basically.

13:24.929 --> 13:28.974
-Why lie about something like that?
-Why lie about why you were kicked out?

13:29.058 --> 13:31.143
That nice lady said you trashed her house.

13:31.727 --> 13:32.895
[Tontu] She's lying.

13:32.978 --> 13:35.105
I'm completely innocent. Hmph.

13:36.315 --> 13:39.777
I know you're capable of it.
Every nisse says the same thing.

13:39.860 --> 13:41.862
But they're all probably lying.

13:41.946 --> 13:44.490
And of course
that's what they'd say about you.

13:44.573 --> 13:47.785
Ugh! I've spent so much time
looking for you and worrying about you

13:47.868 --> 13:49.495
because I felt I ought to help you.

13:49.578 --> 13:53.415
Now I don't know if I should've bothered,
and you're not even grateful that I did.

13:54.250 --> 13:57.378
[Tontu] What? This is
what I look like when I'm grateful.

13:57.461 --> 13:58.462
Oh.

14:05.302 --> 14:06.345
I have to go.

14:06.428 --> 14:08.222
Listen, why don't you check
this place out?

14:08.305 --> 14:11.016
The Scout Hall must have
loads of Nowhere Space, right?

14:11.100 --> 14:13.769
If it's not good,
just meet me afterwards, okay?

14:22.695 --> 14:24.697
Up next: Frida.

14:27.616 --> 14:31.829
You have achieved your level three
Helpful and Friendly badge

14:31.912 --> 14:37.793
along with your Fund Raising, First Aid,
Stonework, and Young Entrepreneur badges.

14:37.877 --> 14:41.380
I think we can all agree
that's very impressive.

14:43.883 --> 14:46.969
[Raven Leader]
Next: David for his Fund Raising...

14:47.052 --> 14:49.179
-[hound growling]
-...and Cycling badges.

14:49.263 --> 14:50.556
[Tontu gasps] Uh-oh.

14:50.639 --> 14:54.435
Oh, and also his Friend to Insects badge.

14:55.978 --> 14:58.939
-[cricket chirping]
-There's a bug on your head.

15:00.566 --> 15:04.403
And that concludes
this year's badge ceremony.

15:04.904 --> 15:06.572
[applause]

15:11.410 --> 15:12.953
-[Tontu] Hilda!
-[kids gasp]

15:13.537 --> 15:14.997
[crowd gasping]

15:15.080 --> 15:17.791
-Tontu?
-[Tontu] We've gotta go, now!

15:18.375 --> 15:19.460
[Tontu grunts]

15:19.543 --> 15:20.419
[crowd gasps]

15:22.212 --> 15:24.256
[growling]

15:24.340 --> 15:26.759
-[all screaming]
-[boy] It's the Black Hound!

15:26.842 --> 15:29.929
-[all shouting]
-[Raven Leader] Please keep calm!

15:30.012 --> 15:31.680
Keep calm, everybody.

15:32.348 --> 15:34.266
-[Tontu] Oh...
-[growls]

15:34.850 --> 15:36.185
[Tontu] Come on! [grunts]

15:37.061 --> 15:38.312
[growling]

15:38.854 --> 15:40.064
Hilda!

15:41.231 --> 15:43.233
[Tontu] Jump! Through here!

15:45.653 --> 15:48.322
-[Tontu grunts]
-[cat yowling]

15:48.906 --> 15:50.783
[Tontu grunting]

15:50.866 --> 15:51.867
In here!

15:56.121 --> 15:57.456
[Tontu panting]

15:57.539 --> 15:58.374
[grunts]

16:00.709 --> 16:02.086
Frida's lost book?

16:02.169 --> 16:04.129
[snarling]

16:04.213 --> 16:05.464
[barking]

16:05.547 --> 16:06.465
Ah!

16:07.508 --> 16:08.467
[Tontu] In here!

16:11.261 --> 16:12.888
[Tontu shouts, panting]

16:12.972 --> 16:14.390
Oh! This is Frida's room.

16:15.849 --> 16:16.976
[Tontu] Come on!

16:24.566 --> 16:26.193
-In here! [groans]
-Wait!

16:26.276 --> 16:27.653
[pants] This is my house!

16:27.736 --> 16:29.530
[growling]

16:31.865 --> 16:33.701
Actually, it's my house.

16:34.326 --> 16:35.452
[growls]

16:35.536 --> 16:38.038
So I would ask you kindly to leave.

16:39.289 --> 16:40.749
[sniffing]

16:44.336 --> 16:45.879
Jellybean?

16:47.047 --> 16:48.507
[panting]

16:49.091 --> 16:50.676
[gasps] Jellybean!

16:50.759 --> 16:52.594
It's you!

16:52.678 --> 16:54.013
[both] Jellybean?

16:54.096 --> 16:57.182
This is my dog Jellybean.

16:57.766 --> 17:00.394
I haven't seen him since he was a puppy.

17:01.103 --> 17:03.981
<i>I found him a long time ago</i>
<i>when I was little.</i>

17:04.064 --> 17:05.065
<i>He was lost.</i>

17:05.149 --> 17:08.193
<i>I did what nisses do with lost things</i>
<i>and took him home.</i>

17:08.277 --> 17:11.989
<i>I looked after him in secret for a while,</i>
<i>but when my parents found him,</i>

17:12.072 --> 17:14.116
<i>they took him off me</i>
<i>and I never saw him again.</i>

17:15.576 --> 17:17.494
I've never understood why.

17:17.578 --> 17:19.705
They must have known
what he'd grow up to be.

17:19.788 --> 17:22.708
I never knew he would get so big!

17:22.791 --> 17:26.128
[Tontu] But is he dangerous?
He ate people, didn't he?

17:26.211 --> 17:28.547
Yes. Three at last count.

17:28.630 --> 17:29.798
Hold on.

17:29.882 --> 17:31.592
[whispering]

17:33.594 --> 17:35.012
[gagging]

17:37.639 --> 17:38.974
[all screaming]

17:39.475 --> 17:41.602
So I guess he sort of ate them.

17:41.685 --> 17:43.771
Hilda? Hilda!

17:44.813 --> 17:46.523
Oh, are you all right?

17:46.607 --> 17:48.233
-[sniffing]
-[gasps]

17:48.317 --> 17:50.277
It's okay, Mum. This is Jellybean.

17:50.778 --> 17:53.238
-This explains everything.
-[Tontu] Really?

17:53.322 --> 17:56.158
He was taught how to use the nisse spaces
when he was a puppy,

17:56.241 --> 17:59.661
so of course he's been using them
to hide and move around the city.

17:59.745 --> 18:02.331
Every time he goes through a nisse's nest,
he's so massive,

18:02.414 --> 18:04.208
<i>he takes everything with him.</i>

18:04.792 --> 18:07.294
<i>And then he trashes whatever room</i>
<i>he happens to arrive in.</i>

18:07.377 --> 18:10.964
<i>It all happens so fast that he's gone</i>
<i>before you know what's going on.</i>

18:11.048 --> 18:14.635
That's why you're all getting kicked out.
He's been framing you.

18:14.718 --> 18:18.222
Are you saying that's what happened to me?
Wouldn't I have seen him?

18:18.305 --> 18:21.600
[chuckles] It's a wonder you can see
anything at all with that haircut.

18:21.683 --> 18:23.352
[police siren wailing]

18:23.435 --> 18:24.394
What's that?

18:25.604 --> 18:28.065
[sirens blaring]

18:29.358 --> 18:32.861
-Those are the men looking for the hound.
-You have to get rid of them.

18:32.945 --> 18:35.155
Hilda, maybe it's best if we just--

18:35.239 --> 18:36.281
Mum, no!

18:36.365 --> 18:40.202
I know what you think,
but he's really a very dangerous animal.

18:40.285 --> 18:42.621
He's a puppy.
He's no different from Twig.

18:42.704 --> 18:44.081
-Hilda...
-[sighs]

18:44.164 --> 18:47.668
I know I don't have a badge to prove it,
but I am still a friend to animals.

18:47.751 --> 18:50.671
He hasn't hurt anyone
and I won't let anyone hurt him.

18:50.754 --> 18:52.464
-[siren chirping]
-[hound whimpers]

18:56.218 --> 18:57.386
[whines]

18:58.846 --> 19:00.681
[whimpering]

19:00.764 --> 19:03.267
-He's panicking.
-[nisse] How far are the city walls?

19:03.350 --> 19:05.811
If I could get him outside,
maybe they'd let him go.

19:07.646 --> 19:08.564
Follow me.

19:09.398 --> 19:11.608
[tires squealing]

19:11.692 --> 19:13.152
Jellybean!

19:13.235 --> 19:14.403
[whimpers]

19:14.486 --> 19:16.572
Everyone, seat belts.

19:19.575 --> 19:21.910
[nisse] Jellybean!

19:28.584 --> 19:30.252
[tires screeching]

19:36.508 --> 19:37.759
[Tontu grunting]

19:38.343 --> 19:40.262
Mum, go faster!

19:45.017 --> 19:47.686
[Mum] Oh, I can see the town gate.
We're almost there.

19:47.769 --> 19:49.938
[Tontu] What happens
if he catches up with us?

19:51.356 --> 19:54.276
[tires screeching]

19:54.359 --> 19:55.861
I can't see a thing!

19:56.445 --> 19:59.364
-[all shout]
-[Mum] Oh, the brakes aren't working!

19:59.990 --> 20:00.908
[Tontu whimpers]

20:02.159 --> 20:04.745
-Tontu, quick, take my hand.
-[Tontu] Whoa, whoa, wait!

20:04.828 --> 20:07.122
I know what you're thinking.
It's too dangerous.

20:07.706 --> 20:10.709
-Tontu, we're going to crash!
-[Tontu] Okay, okay!

20:10.792 --> 20:12.336
One, two, pull!

20:20.552 --> 20:22.054
[Tontu shouting]

20:24.014 --> 20:25.265
[groans]

20:25.349 --> 20:26.225
[sighs]

20:26.808 --> 20:28.435
What on Earth just happened?

20:28.518 --> 20:31.355
[Tontu] That place
is the place we never go to.

20:31.438 --> 20:33.482
Sorry for dragging you through there.

20:33.565 --> 20:34.983
It was necessary.

20:35.859 --> 20:37.611
[chuckles] Don't apologize.

20:37.694 --> 20:39.196
You saved our lives.

20:39.279 --> 20:40.822
And we escaped, too.

20:40.906 --> 20:44.910
-But... where are the others?
-We got separated.

20:44.993 --> 20:47.955
They could be
thousands of miles away right now...

20:48.538 --> 20:50.749
if they even made it out at all.

20:55.212 --> 20:57.256
Here, I've got something for you.

20:57.756 --> 21:01.551
I finally found my sewing kit,
so I thought I'd make an addition.

21:04.554 --> 21:07.641
Look, I'm sorry that I pressured you
about getting badges.

21:07.724 --> 21:09.601
I already know that you're the kindest,

21:09.685 --> 21:13.438
bravest, most selfless girl
it is possible to be.

21:13.522 --> 21:15.399
You don't have to prove anything.

21:16.191 --> 21:17.192
Thanks, Mum.

21:20.737 --> 21:21.780
[Tontu clears throat]

21:21.863 --> 21:23.991
Your hot chocolates are ready.

21:24.074 --> 21:25.534
No marshmallows for you.

21:25.617 --> 21:27.786
Loads of marshmallows for you.

21:28.537 --> 21:32.040
This report will set off
a golden age of elf exploration!

21:32.124 --> 21:34.876
[gasps] Just think
of all the missing paperwork

21:34.960 --> 21:37.212
that may have fallen into Nowhere Space!

21:37.296 --> 21:38.338
[doorbell rings]

21:39.131 --> 21:40.841
That's probably David and Frida.

21:40.924 --> 21:43.176
[Tontu] I'll get more hot chocolate.
[grunts]

21:43.260 --> 21:45.470
I'll get some biscuits and Dragon Panic.

21:47.472 --> 21:50.851
Is that a kind of a badge?

21:51.518 --> 21:53.812
Please find a reason
for this not to be on my arm

21:53.895 --> 21:55.689
before the next Sparrow Scout meeting.

21:55.772 --> 22:00.485
-Maybe Tontu could, you know, "borrow it"?
-[Tontu] Not a chance.

22:01.236 --> 22:03.905
[Frida] I know!
Twig could snag it with an antler.

22:03.989 --> 22:05.991
[Alfur]
Or we could pay a visit to the lindworm

22:06.074 --> 22:07.784
and have it lightly scorched.

22:07.868 --> 22:09.244
[woffs calling]

22:17.419 --> 22:20.922
[elves murmuring]

22:21.840 --> 22:24.843
[Wood Man whistling tune]

22:25.761 --> 22:27.012
What happened?

22:27.095 --> 22:30.098
[Wood Man] This was once
a cozy little house.

22:30.182 --> 22:32.434
The girl who lived here
befriended a giant.

22:32.517 --> 22:35.520
-I guess she learned her lesson.
-Not likely.

22:36.772 --> 22:39.649
Odds are... she'd do it again.

22:41.360 --> 22:44.029
[folk music playing]
