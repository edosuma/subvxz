00:02.336 --> 00:03.838
Previously on 90210...

00:03.879 --> 00:06.799
When people find out I'm gay,
that's all I'm gonna be.

00:06.841 --> 00:08.550
ANNIE:
I totally understand

00:08.592 --> 00:09.969
what you're going through.

00:10.010 --> 00:11.595
I thought that everyone here

00:11.637 --> 00:13.347
was gonna be shallow
and superficial,

00:13.388 --> 00:15.891
but then I lived here for
a little while, and I realized

00:15.933 --> 00:17.893
that people here are just
as nice and genuine

00:17.935 --> 00:19.394
as the people back home.

00:19.436 --> 00:22.690
I think you are both amazing,
beautiful people.

00:22.731 --> 00:24.984
You're not at all shallow

00:25.024 --> 00:26.276
and superficial
like Annie said.

00:26.318 --> 00:27.611
What?

00:27.653 --> 00:29.363
What the hell is this?

00:29.404 --> 00:31.782
I was just, uh, helping
Emily run lines.

00:31.824 --> 00:33.367
Don't you see it?

00:33.408 --> 00:36.036
She won't stop until
she destroys my entire life.

00:36.077 --> 00:37.997
Who do you think they're
going to believe-- you,

00:38.038 --> 00:40.791
or innocent little Emily?

00:40.833 --> 00:42.835
I'm Max. We're lab partners.

00:42.877 --> 00:45.044
You know what, Max?
I'm a lot of things.

00:45.086 --> 00:47.756
An airhead, a clothes horse,
an occasional bitch,

00:47.798 --> 00:49.925
but I am not a quitter.

00:49.967 --> 00:51.969
Oh!

00:52.011 --> 00:54.013
I think I have the hots
for a nerd.

00:54.054 --> 00:55.681
He's cheating on me.
Why would you think that?

00:55.723 --> 00:57.474
Because I found this
in his room.

00:57.516 --> 01:00.394
(gasps)

01:00.435 --> 01:03.146
Fine. I cheated.

01:03.188 --> 01:05.941
Maybe it's time
you try to move on from Navid.

01:05.983 --> 01:07.985
I'm gonna find out
who this belongs to,

01:08.027 --> 01:09.486
and I'm going

01:09.528 --> 01:12.072
to destroy her.

01:13.991 --> 01:15.576
Wow.

01:15.617 --> 01:16.952
This is an
amazing specimen.

01:16.994 --> 01:18.746
Oh, yeah?

01:21.040 --> 01:24.668
It's... not as... amazing

01:24.710 --> 01:27.588
a... specimen as you.

01:30.883 --> 01:33.468
Ooh, Max.

01:33.510 --> 01:36.095
Naomi.

01:38.097 --> 01:39.975

01:47.649 --> 01:49.902

(both sighing)

01:54.573 --> 01:55.699
(glass clinking)

01:55.741 --> 01:57.618
No. Wait.

01:57.659 --> 02:00.662
This isn't right.
Something's wrong.

02:00.704 --> 02:03.916
No, nothing's wrong.

02:03.958 --> 02:08.002
In fact, everything's as right
as a 90-degree angle.

02:08.044 --> 02:10.631
Come here, Naomi.

02:10.672 --> 02:13.050
You know you want it.

(seagulls screeching)

02:25.771 --> 02:28.023
James Dean?
I guess.

02:28.065 --> 02:29.984
That's who you want to play you
in your life story?

02:30.025 --> 02:31.986
What? You're the one
who made me choose.

02:32.027 --> 02:33.570
You do realize
he's dead, right?

02:33.612 --> 02:34.989
Yeah. So?

02:35.030 --> 02:37.324
So he can't play you
in your life story.

02:37.365 --> 02:40.535
Whatever, dude. Like Denzel
Washington is any better.

02:40.577 --> 02:41.870
Guy's, like,
50 years old.

02:41.912 --> 02:43.747
At least he's still alive.

02:43.789 --> 02:44.957
Dude, you suck at this game.

02:44.999 --> 02:46.166
Yeah? You suck at pool.

02:46.207 --> 02:49.962
Oh. Did-Did you just attack
my skills?

02:50.004 --> 02:51.379
I think I did.

02:51.421 --> 02:52.589
Oh.

02:52.631 --> 02:54.758
Oh. Attack this.

02:54.800 --> 02:56.093
Oh, man.

02:56.135 --> 02:57.719
NAVID:
Hey, hey, guys!
Oh, yeah.

02:57.761 --> 02:59.096
Sorry.
Sorry, man.

02:59.138 --> 03:00.514
He's trying to
work, idiot.

03:00.555 --> 03:01.640
No, no.
I just thought

03:01.682 --> 03:02.683
you might be interested in this.

03:02.724 --> 03:03.851
I got an e-mail from Kevin,

03:03.892 --> 03:05.978
who normally covers
my sports beat, right?

03:06.020 --> 03:07.354
Well, apparently,
he's got pinkeye,

03:07.395 --> 03:09.230
and he needs someone
to cover his upcoming matches.

03:09.272 --> 03:12.191
And you thought we might
be interested in this?

03:12.233 --> 03:13.652
Including the girls'
beach volleyball finals.

03:13.694 --> 03:14.903
Ah.

03:14.945 --> 03:16.613
And, uh, who is playing

03:16.655 --> 03:17.781
in the finals?

03:17.823 --> 03:18.699
Those smoking hot girls

03:18.740 --> 03:19.616
from the Palisades?

03:19.658 --> 03:20.951
Oh, yeah.

03:20.993 --> 03:22.536
You guys coming with?

03:22.577 --> 03:24.663
Hey, you know how much
we love the Blaze.

03:24.705 --> 03:25.539
Yeah, that's a bunch of bull.

03:25.580 --> 03:26.999
Hey, guys.
Hey.

03:27.041 --> 03:28.125
What's up, Teddy?

03:28.167 --> 03:30.127
Hey.
What are you guys
talking about?

03:31.837 --> 03:32.880
Nothing much.

03:34.006 --> 03:35.465
Yeah, just volleyball.

03:35.507 --> 03:36.800
Yeah.

03:36.842 --> 03:38.093
Oh, yeah?

03:38.135 --> 03:39.511
Yeah.

03:39.553 --> 03:40.762
(bell ringing)

03:40.804 --> 03:41.805
Oh. (clears throat)

03:41.847 --> 03:43.557
I got to get to class.

03:43.598 --> 03:46.101
Oh, me, too.

03:46.143 --> 03:47.227
See you guys later.

03:50.898 --> 03:52.107
Sorry I'm late. Ugh.

03:52.149 --> 03:54.693
I did not get a lot of sleep
last night, and had to deal

03:54.735 --> 03:55.903
with some treacherous
eye bags this morning.

03:55.944 --> 03:57.112
Well, your eyes look fine.

03:57.154 --> 03:59.531
Thank God for
hemorrhoid cream.

03:59.573 --> 04:00.908
Excuse me?

04:00.949 --> 04:02.910
Oh, it shrinks the tissue.

04:02.951 --> 04:04.870
I would think you'd
know that, seeing as

04:04.912 --> 04:05.871
your job is giving guidance.

04:05.913 --> 04:07.915
Well, I-I called you in

04:07.956 --> 04:10.000
because I wanted to talk
to you about CU.

04:10.042 --> 04:12.753
Yes, good. I am here, and

04:12.794 --> 04:14.796
I am incredibly eager
to talk about college.

04:14.838 --> 04:17.048
I can't wait to start at CU
and meet some real men.

04:17.091 --> 04:20.219
There aren't a lot of
brainy nerds at CU, are there?

04:20.260 --> 04:23.597
In college, it's actually
considered cool

04:23.638 --> 04:25.015
to be smart and...

04:25.057 --> 04:27.308
Never mind.

04:27.350 --> 04:29.895
Look, I got a heads up
from the admissions office.

04:29.937 --> 04:31.521
You've been wait-listed.

04:31.563 --> 04:32.689
What?

04:32.731 --> 04:34.149
I understand

04:34.191 --> 04:35.567
you're disappointed,
but being wait-listed

04:35.609 --> 04:37.027
means they're considering
admitting you.

04:37.069 --> 04:38.779
That's good, Naomi.

04:38.820 --> 04:39.780
I don't understand.

04:39.821 --> 04:41.406
My SAT scores were much better

04:41.448 --> 04:43.283
the third time, and I've
been working on the Blaze.

04:43.324 --> 04:45.786
Didn't you see my segment,
"Is Fat Contagious?"

04:45.827 --> 04:48.789
I did. It showed...
a unique voice.

04:53.710 --> 04:54.628
I'm sorry, Naomi.

04:57.338 --> 05:00.300
I was wait-listed.

05:13.105 --> 05:14.314
Oh.
Hey.

05:14.355 --> 05:15.857
Oh, hey, Emily.

05:15.899 --> 05:17.025
(sighs)

05:17.067 --> 05:19.486
Hey.
Sorry about that.

05:19.527 --> 05:21.947
No. I'm sorry. I wasn't
looking where I was going.

05:21.989 --> 05:23.282
(clears throat)
Thanks.

05:23.323 --> 05:24.866
How have you been?
Oh.

05:24.908 --> 05:27.577
Um... okay.

05:27.619 --> 05:29.997
Yeah?

05:30.038 --> 05:33.374
Yeah. Things have been,
um, okay.

05:33.416 --> 05:37.629
Things have been actually
pretty awful at home.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.256
Annie hates me.

05:39.298 --> 05:41.133
No way. Annie
doesn't hate you.

05:41.175 --> 05:42.968
I never should have
auditioned for that play.

05:43.010 --> 05:44.636
It was so stupid!

05:44.678 --> 05:46.305
She totally hates me
for it.

05:46.345 --> 05:47.806
Emily that-that's
just not true.

05:47.848 --> 05:48.932
She called me a...

05:48.974 --> 05:50.892
a "B" word.

05:50.934 --> 05:52.686
Really?

05:52.727 --> 05:54.646
You know, I worshipped Annie
ever since I was a kid.

05:54.688 --> 05:56.148
All I wanted was

05:56.190 --> 05:58.317
her approval and her friendship.

05:58.357 --> 06:01.278
And now she hates me.

06:01.320 --> 06:03.322
And she's giving me

06:03.362 --> 06:04.990
the silent treatment,
and it's awful.

06:05.032 --> 06:06.700
No, you shouldn't do that.

06:06.741 --> 06:07.701
What do you mean?

06:07.742 --> 06:09.077
If Annie saw you touching me,

06:09.119 --> 06:10.411
she would probably accuse me

06:10.453 --> 06:12.831
of hitting on you,
and freak out or something.

06:12.873 --> 06:15.709
In fact, we probably shouldn't
talk to each other at all.

06:15.750 --> 06:17.211
Annie would hate it.

06:17.252 --> 06:19.713
Emily, that-that is just
not true.

06:27.054 --> 06:30.098
Ivy, come here.

06:30.140 --> 06:31.266
Think I should get this sushi?

06:31.308 --> 06:33.060
No. Come on. What,
did you fall

06:33.101 --> 06:35.436
on your head? Definitely
do not get the mystery sushi.

06:35.478 --> 06:37.981
That stuff's
riskier than Fugu.
Fugu?

06:38.023 --> 06:40.025
Yeah, you know that
Japanese puffer fish.

06:40.067 --> 06:41.776
Really? You don't
know what Fugu is?

06:41.818 --> 06:43.820
Hey, I-I grew up
in Kansas, okay?

06:43.862 --> 06:45.364
(chuckles)

06:45.404 --> 06:47.406
Um, well, it's got to be
prepared perfectly

06:47.448 --> 06:49.201
or it's poisonous.

06:49.243 --> 06:50.785
Wow, that's cool.

06:50.827 --> 06:52.162
It's like playing
Russian roulette at dinner.

06:52.204 --> 06:54.248
(chuckles) Kind of.

06:54.289 --> 06:57.125
You know, there's this place
downtown that has it...

06:57.167 --> 06:58.793
if you wanted
to go sometime.

06:58.835 --> 07:00.879
That'd be kind of fun.

07:00.921 --> 07:02.214
You mean, like, as friends?

07:02.256 --> 07:06.425
Uh, well... I mean,
I was actually,

07:06.467 --> 07:09.263
I was thinking
maybe more than friends.

07:11.806 --> 07:14.351
Um... I can't.

07:14.393 --> 07:15.936
Sorry, Ivy.

07:15.977 --> 07:17.729
After what happened with you
and Oscar, I...

07:17.771 --> 07:19.439
friends is all we could ever be.

07:20.857 --> 07:23.110
Got it.

07:23.151 --> 07:25.528
You know, I'm actually
gonna get out of here.

07:25.570 --> 07:27.447
I don't... I forgot.
I'm really not that hungry.

07:41.002 --> 07:42.796
Silver, over here.

07:42.837 --> 07:45.006
Sorry I'm late.

07:45.048 --> 07:47.134
Any news?

07:47.175 --> 07:49.094
Not yet. Giles is meeting

07:49.136 --> 07:50.595
with the other producers
this morning.

07:50.637 --> 07:52.306
He said he'd call by noon,
and it's...

07:52.347 --> 07:53.807
(phone rings)

07:53.848 --> 07:55.183
It's him! Wish me luck.

07:55.225 --> 07:57.018
If this goes well,
you might be

07:57.060 --> 07:58.395
having lunch
with the next Lauren Conrad.

07:58.437 --> 07:59.813
Good luck.

07:59.854 --> 08:01.022
(squeals)

08:01.064 --> 08:03.150
Hey, Giles.
How'd the meeting go?

08:05.777 --> 08:06.736
What?

08:09.990 --> 08:12.159
Yeah, but you were the one
who came to me.

08:12.200 --> 08:15.078
But there will be drama.

08:15.120 --> 08:17.414
I'm all about drama.

08:17.456 --> 08:19.249
Yeah, of course.

08:21.251 --> 08:26.256
Oh, I'm not really sure
he'd agree to do that.

08:26.298 --> 08:28.133
Okay, yeah, you, too.

08:28.175 --> 08:29.550
Bye.

08:30.969 --> 08:33.513
What happened?

08:33.554 --> 08:35.849
They have a lot of shows on
their plate, and they decided

08:35.890 --> 08:37.892
not to take mine to the studio
at this point.

08:37.933 --> 08:39.852
What does that mean?

08:39.894 --> 08:42.897
It means it's over:
my reality show,

08:42.938 --> 08:43.982
my career,

08:44.024 --> 08:45.859
everything.

08:45.900 --> 08:47.819
Ade, ah, God, I'm sorry.

08:47.861 --> 08:50.197
Is there something
that we can do?

08:50.238 --> 08:52.115
This is all Navid's fault.

08:52.157 --> 08:53.992
What do you mean?

08:54.034 --> 08:55.202
Giles just said

08:55.243 --> 08:56.703
if Navid signed a release,

08:56.744 --> 08:58.913
we could have put
that huge fight that we had

08:58.955 --> 09:00.374
in the pilot
presentation.

09:00.415 --> 09:03.001
I mean, that's the kind
of drama we needed.

09:03.043 --> 09:05.753
I can't believe that Navid
is ruining my career,

09:05.795 --> 09:08.548
on top of breaking up with me
and cheating on me.

09:09.883 --> 09:11.510
(sighs)

09:11.551 --> 09:13.345
You know what?
There is something you can do.

09:13.387 --> 09:16.264
What's that?

09:16.306 --> 09:19.351
You can help me find
the cheating whore

09:19.393 --> 09:20.560
who's ruined
my life.

09:46.169 --> 09:47.670
I cannot believe

09:47.712 --> 09:49.464
we're graduating in
a matter of months.

09:49.506 --> 09:51.049
Mmm.

09:51.091 --> 09:52.592
We're never gonna walk
these hallways again,

09:52.633 --> 09:54.594
or eat in the
cafeteria again.

09:54.635 --> 09:58.515
(gasps) We're never gonna
have lockers

09:58.557 --> 09:59.516
ever again.

09:59.558 --> 10:01.935
Um, you're getting
nostalgic

10:01.976 --> 10:03.061
for high school?

10:03.103 --> 10:04.438
I know. (chuckles)

10:04.479 --> 10:06.481
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

10:06.523 --> 10:09.192
Oh, hey, so I applied
to this place Drexel.

10:09.234 --> 10:11.069
Drexel University?

10:11.111 --> 10:12.362
Like, in Philadelphia?

10:12.404 --> 10:14.573
Yeah, well, I figured
they have

10:14.614 --> 10:16.575
a good engineering
department.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.618
Oh.
And, uh,
Pennsylvania's cool

10:18.659 --> 10:20.370
'cause it's close
to New York...

10:20.412 --> 10:24.332
Pittsburgh,
Carnegie Mellon.

10:24.374 --> 10:26.418
Oh, and-and you.

10:26.460 --> 10:27.502
Oh.

10:27.544 --> 10:31.131
I'm nostalgic
for right now.

10:31.172 --> 10:33.216
But I don't think

10:33.258 --> 10:35.009
I'm gonna get in
to Carnegie Mellon.

10:35.051 --> 10:36.052
You'll get in.

10:36.094 --> 10:38.096
I had this meeting
with Ms. Silverman,

10:38.138 --> 10:40.181
and she said that
over half

10:40.223 --> 10:41.933
of the drama
applicants have had

10:41.975 --> 10:42.934
real theater experience.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.519
I would have been
much better off

10:44.561 --> 10:46.521
had I been in
the Abbott production.

10:46.563 --> 10:49.107
Ugh! I should have
gotten that part.

10:49.149 --> 10:51.568
You know, sometimes
you just gotta move on.

10:51.610 --> 10:53.612
What's that supposed to mean?

10:53.653 --> 10:57.157
(sighs) Maybe you should stop
punishing Emily.

10:57.198 --> 10:58.866
She didn't mean
to take your part.

10:58.908 --> 11:01.161
Okay, first of all,
she did mean to take my part.

11:01.202 --> 11:02.579
Annie, come on.

11:02.621 --> 11:05.248
And second of all--
punishing her--

11:05.290 --> 11:07.125
I'm not punishing her.
You're giving her
the silent treatment.

11:07.167 --> 11:08.126
What? Says who?

11:08.168 --> 11:09.377
Says Emily.

11:09.419 --> 11:12.088
Why are you talking
to Emily?

11:12.130 --> 11:13.632
Why am I talking to Emily?

11:13.672 --> 11:16.009
You don't care if
I talk to her, do you?

11:16.050 --> 11:17.552
Yes, I do, actually.

11:17.594 --> 11:18.970
I don't trust her.

11:19.012 --> 11:20.972
Annie, come on.

11:21.014 --> 11:23.224
Just-- just stay away
from her, okay?

11:23.266 --> 11:25.018
Okay.

11:25.059 --> 11:27.312
You know what, you
need to chill out.

11:35.028 --> 11:36.279
Hey.

11:36.321 --> 11:37.696
Hi.

11:37.738 --> 11:39.366
Uh, hey, Silver.

11:39.407 --> 11:42.452
(loudly): Did you finish that
report on low-flush toilets?

11:42.494 --> 11:44.371
(loudly): Yes.
Absolutely. Here it is.

11:44.412 --> 11:46.623
Great. Thank you.

11:46.665 --> 11:48.625
Hey.
Hi.

11:48.667 --> 11:50.585
We have to talk.
Sure.

11:50.627 --> 11:52.253
Oh, no.

11:52.295 --> 11:53.463
I mean...

11:53.505 --> 11:54.673
Oh, really?

11:54.713 --> 11:56.508
...talk, talk.
What's going on?

11:56.550 --> 12:00.679
Okay, this whole stupid earring
thing is just haunting me.

12:00.719 --> 12:02.305
Adrianna is obsessed with
finding out whose it is.

12:02.347 --> 12:05.099
It's an earring.
She's not going
to link it to you.

12:05.141 --> 12:06.725
It was made by
a local designer,

12:06.767 --> 12:08.353
and she only sells her stuff
in, like, two boutiques.

12:08.395 --> 12:10.355
Ade knows those are
my favorite stores.

12:10.397 --> 12:12.731
I swear, I'm never wearing
earrings again.

12:12.773 --> 12:15.485
Okay, so maybe we can
point her in some
new direction.

12:15.527 --> 12:16.861
Ade's like a baby.

12:16.903 --> 12:19.197
We just need to hand her
something new and shiny

12:19.239 --> 12:20.699
to distract her.
Exactly.

12:20.739 --> 12:22.617
So what I've been
thinking is you...

12:22.659 --> 12:25.537
She needs a new guy
to obsess over.

12:25.579 --> 12:27.163
How about Dixon?
He's single.

12:27.205 --> 12:30.291
No. Not Dixon, no.

12:30.333 --> 12:33.545
Look, I think you should
sign the release to
do her reality show.

12:33.587 --> 12:35.547
That's going to give her
something to focus on.

12:35.589 --> 12:38.091
Her career-- and that's
what she really cares about.

12:38.132 --> 12:39.384
No, no, no, no, no.

12:39.426 --> 12:40.801
I don't want the
whole country watching me

12:40.843 --> 12:42.721
tell my ex-girlfriend
that I cheated on her.

12:42.761 --> 12:45.473
I know, but if you don't,
she's going to find out, Navid.

12:45.515 --> 12:48.393
She'll find out it was me,
and then everything is
going to go to hell.

12:53.732 --> 12:55.233
This is pretty amazing.

12:56.775 --> 12:58.486
It's crazy how narrow
our perception

12:58.528 --> 13:00.405
of the universe is.

13:00.447 --> 13:02.781
You know what I mean?
Not really.

13:02.823 --> 13:05.452
I mean, we're peeking through
this tiny window,

13:05.493 --> 13:07.704
limited by the wavelengths

13:07.746 --> 13:09.456
which our eyes and
our ears can perceive,

13:09.497 --> 13:11.207
and yet there's this whole
universe out there

13:11.249 --> 13:13.293
filled with dark matter
and nematodes

13:13.334 --> 13:16.379
and other things you can't
see with the naked eye.

13:16.421 --> 13:18.214
Please don't say "naked."

13:18.256 --> 13:19.758
Here, take a look.

13:19.798 --> 13:21.092
No, thanks. I'm trying
to find our data.

13:21.134 --> 13:22.469
It's not on my computer.

13:22.510 --> 13:24.262
I know I saved it somewhere.

13:24.304 --> 13:26.431
(beep)
Aw, I suck at computers.

13:26.473 --> 13:28.600
Here, let me take a look.

13:31.352 --> 13:32.520
(shrieks)
Whoa.

13:32.562 --> 13:33.647
Are you okay?

13:33.688 --> 13:35.398
Oh, I'm sorry.

13:35.440 --> 13:36.357
I'm just on edge.

13:36.399 --> 13:37.692
Why?

13:37.734 --> 13:40.737
Um... I...

13:40.779 --> 13:44.449
just found out I was
wait-listed at CU.

13:44.491 --> 13:47.494
It's, like my dream school.

13:47.535 --> 13:49.746
Now I pretty much have
nothing to live for.

13:52.373 --> 13:53.832
"Victor numquam cedit."

13:53.874 --> 13:56.377
Who's that?
Is he cute?

13:56.419 --> 13:58.296
It's not a guy.

13:58.338 --> 13:59.673
It's a Latin phrase.

13:59.714 --> 14:00.965
It means "a winner
never gives up."

14:02.759 --> 14:05.303
Because you may be
many things, Naomi,

14:05.345 --> 14:09.516
airhead, clotheshorse,
an occasional bitch,

14:09.557 --> 14:12.686
but you are not a quitter.

14:12.727 --> 14:14.479
Or so you led me to believe.

14:14.521 --> 14:16.230
Look, you still have

14:16.272 --> 14:17.856
time to impress CU.

14:17.898 --> 14:19.651
Colleges want more
than just good grades.

14:19.693 --> 14:21.277
They want people
with the whole package.

14:21.319 --> 14:23.446
Sports, charity work,

14:23.488 --> 14:25.239
uh, extracurriculars.

14:25.281 --> 14:27.116
Hey, you could join
the marching band.

14:28.743 --> 14:30.829
Or what about chess club?

14:30.870 --> 14:32.288
They're always
looking for girls.

14:32.330 --> 14:34.749
I could imagine.

14:34.791 --> 14:36.584
But, no, you're right.

14:36.626 --> 14:38.503
I'll think of something.

14:38.545 --> 14:40.880
Victor numbnuts credit.

14:40.921 --> 14:44.175
Victor numquam cedit.

14:44.217 --> 14:46.803
Victor numquam cedit.

14:54.394 --> 14:55.520
Shotgun!

14:55.562 --> 14:56.604
(laughing)

14:58.606 --> 14:59.816
ANNIE:
Hey, wait up.

14:59.858 --> 15:01.192
Hey.

15:01.234 --> 15:03.403
God, it feels like
it's been forever

15:03.444 --> 15:04.612
since I've seen
you guys.

15:04.654 --> 15:05.822
Yeah, it's been a while.

15:05.864 --> 15:07.323
Yeah, I've missed you.

15:07.365 --> 15:08.616
Yeah.

15:08.658 --> 15:10.368
And I could also
really use someone

15:10.410 --> 15:12.537
to vent to, 'cause Emily is
driving me crazy.

15:12.579 --> 15:15.998
Hmm, really?
Yeah, she's awful.

15:16.040 --> 15:17.876
She's completely driving a wedge
between Liam and me.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.794
Maybe you're being a little
sensitive about Emily.

15:19.836 --> 15:21.838
What do you mean, sensitive?

15:21.880 --> 15:23.798
NAOMI:
What we mean is maybe
you're a little jealous

15:23.840 --> 15:24.841
that she got
the part you wanted.

15:24.883 --> 15:25.842
I'm not jealous.

15:25.884 --> 15:27.802
I'm just angry, 'cause she keeps

15:27.844 --> 15:29.596
doing things
behind my back.

15:29.637 --> 15:31.222
She's not a very
good person.

15:31.264 --> 15:33.558
Well, maybe you're being
a little judgmental.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.309
Well, maybe she deserves it.

15:35.351 --> 15:36.853
Nothing about that girl is real.

15:36.895 --> 15:38.563
Just like us?

15:38.605 --> 15:39.647
What's that supposed to mean?

15:39.689 --> 15:40.940
Ade...

15:40.981 --> 15:43.234
When we were at the sweat lodge,

15:43.276 --> 15:44.778
Emily told us what
you said about us.

15:44.819 --> 15:46.863
How you think we're shallow
and not genuine.
What?

15:46.905 --> 15:48.656
I never said that.

15:48.698 --> 15:51.075
Okay. Okay.

15:52.326 --> 15:54.078
Emily!

15:56.873 --> 15:59.417
Hey, Annie, what's
going on?

15:59.459 --> 16:01.377
Why'd you tell me friends
I said they were shallow?

16:01.419 --> 16:03.630
Because you did.

16:03.671 --> 16:05.548
What?
At the retreat.

16:05.590 --> 16:07.425
Before dinner. Remember?

16:07.467 --> 16:11.930
Okay, she is completely taking
that out of context, all right?

16:11.971 --> 16:15.391
I said something like that, but
that's not how I meant it.

16:15.433 --> 16:16.935
Oh, yeah? Well, how did
you mean it, Annie?

16:16.976 --> 16:20.563
Look, I said that I thought
you guys were going to
be shallow at first.

16:20.605 --> 16:22.356
Before I moved here,
I thought everybody

16:22.398 --> 16:23.858
in Beverly Hills was
going to be shallow.

16:23.900 --> 16:25.735
But then I got to know you,

16:25.777 --> 16:27.612
and I obviously don't
think that anymore.

16:27.654 --> 16:29.447
And that's totally
possible.

16:29.489 --> 16:32.116
It's just-- that's not the way
I remember hearing it.

16:32.158 --> 16:34.619
Of course not, 'cause
you're a manipulative liar.

16:34.661 --> 16:35.995
Can't you guys see this?

16:37.538 --> 16:39.874
If that's really
what you think, then...

16:43.461 --> 16:45.630
I didn't mean to hurt anybody.

16:45.672 --> 16:47.047
I'm really sorry, Annie.

16:48.549 --> 16:49.467
(sobbing)

16:52.345 --> 16:53.680
You made her cry?

16:53.721 --> 16:55.014
Those are not real tears.

16:55.055 --> 16:56.891
She is faking
it, all right?

16:56.933 --> 16:58.518
This is what she does.
Trust me.

16:58.559 --> 16:59.727
They looked real to me.

17:13.324 --> 17:15.159
♪ ♪

17:20.999 --> 17:24.251
(chuckles)

17:28.506 --> 17:31.384
(door opening)

17:31.425 --> 17:32.969
Hey, babe.

17:33.011 --> 17:35.304
What's up, mamacita?

17:35.346 --> 17:37.515
(sniffs)

17:38.683 --> 17:40.852
What are you doing?

17:40.894 --> 17:42.937
Just watching TV,
smoking pot.

17:42.979 --> 17:43.980
You want some?

17:44.022 --> 17:45.648
No.

17:45.690 --> 17:47.400
When did this start?

17:47.441 --> 17:50.361
Please, I've always liked
cartoons.

17:50.403 --> 17:51.404
The pot, Ivy.

17:51.445 --> 17:53.364
Oh. Um...

17:53.406 --> 17:56.200
I don't know, I guess
after my accident,

17:56.242 --> 17:59.161
I figured out that getting high
helps with my stress.

17:59.203 --> 18:04.083
And today I was stressing big
time, so I got stoned.

18:04.124 --> 18:06.586
What do you mean you were
stressing big time?

18:06.627 --> 18:10.423
I just had this really awkward
thing happen with Dixon,

18:10.464 --> 18:13.426
and I don't know what
I was thinking.

18:13.467 --> 18:14.969
Let's talk about it.

18:15.011 --> 18:17.179
I just don't really want
to talk about it with you.

18:20.140 --> 18:23.019
Fine. Then, you know, maybe you
should see a therapist.

18:23.061 --> 18:24.687
(scoffs)

18:24.729 --> 18:27.815
Why should I talk to a therapist
when you smoke pot all the time?

18:27.857 --> 18:30.068
I mean, really, where do you
think I got that anyways?

18:30.109 --> 18:32.445
I don't use pot to
self-medicate.

18:32.486 --> 18:35.114
Hey, Mom, don't be such
a hypocrite about it.

18:37.075 --> 18:38.659
You know what?

18:38.701 --> 18:41.495
Call me what you want,

18:41.537 --> 18:42.288
but you're not smoking anymore.

18:44.874 --> 18:46.250
(groans)

18:47.961 --> 18:49.211
(school bell ringing)

18:52.590 --> 18:53.883
Hey.

18:53.925 --> 18:55.760
Where you headed?

18:55.802 --> 18:57.845
I just thought I'd eat lunch
in the courtyard.

18:57.887 --> 19:00.306
Oh, what's going on? Why aren't
you eating with the guys?

19:01.933 --> 19:04.102
Uh, just,
things are a little weird.

19:04.143 --> 19:07.146
What do you mean?
What's going on?

19:10.190 --> 19:12.151
I walked in on 'em talking about
going to some girls'

19:12.192 --> 19:14.028
volleyball tournament.
But when they saw me,

19:14.070 --> 19:16.155
they freaked out
and stopped talking.

19:16.196 --> 19:18.491
Made it pretty clear
they didn't want me to come.

19:18.532 --> 19:19.993
Are you sure?

19:21.702 --> 19:22.620
It's no big deal.

19:24.538 --> 19:26.124
I'm glad I came out and all,

19:26.165 --> 19:27.541

30:28.201 --> 30:30.496
Mr. July spilled his body oil
all over your computer,

30:30.537 --> 30:32.289
and now it is totally fried.

30:32.331 --> 30:34.249
No! The pictures
are on there!

30:34.291 --> 30:35.292
They're gone.

30:35.334 --> 30:36.835
Oh, my God, no, no, no, no!

30:36.876 --> 30:38.587
I need those pictures
for my calendar shoot

30:38.629 --> 30:40.673
and my CU application!

30:40.714 --> 30:43.175
And you know, there's
those thirsty African people!

30:43.216 --> 30:44.802
I know. I'm sorry.
Naomi, look...

30:44.843 --> 30:46.928
Okay, we need someone
to fix this ASAP.

30:46.970 --> 30:49.055
Which one of you knows
the most about computers?

30:52.643 --> 30:54.186
Never mind.

30:54.227 --> 30:56.146
Oh, my God.

30:58.691 --> 31:01.234
So where exactly are
we going?

31:01.276 --> 31:02.444
You'll see.

31:02.486 --> 31:05.781
Just prepare yourself
for an amazing shock.

31:05.823 --> 31:07.991
Okay, I'm gonna be
honest with you.

31:08.033 --> 31:12.746
I'm just feeling
a little paranoid
right now.

31:12.788 --> 31:14.540
Like maybe I
shouldn't have

31:14.581 --> 31:16.792
followed some random
guy that I met

31:16.834 --> 31:18.794
at what was essentially
a drug deal

31:18.836 --> 31:20.879
into the middle of nowhere,
and probably also

31:20.920 --> 31:22.715
shouldn't be telling him
what I'm thinking.

31:22.756 --> 31:25.258
It's okay.
I'm not some
random guy.

31:25.300 --> 31:27.219
My name is Raj.

31:27.260 --> 31:30.305

at UCLA,

31:30.347 --> 31:31.598
and I'm an okay guy.

31:31.640 --> 31:33.809
Okay?
Okay.

31:33.851 --> 31:35.686
I'm Ivy.

31:35.728 --> 31:37.604
Hi, Ivy.

31:44.862 --> 31:46.446

31:46.488 --> 31:48.198
What is so hard
about saying "2011"?

31:48.240 --> 31:49.658
Dude, "20-11" sounds
so much better.

31:49.700 --> 31:52.369
We all have to commit
if it's gonna work.
Are you in, Teddy?

31:52.411 --> 31:54.204
Sure, wh-whatever.
You sure you know
where we're going?

31:54.246 --> 31:56.248
Yep, totally.

31:56.289 --> 31:58.542
Here we are.

31:58.584 --> 32:01.461
Oh, what? No, y-you guys,
you don't have to do this.

32:01.503 --> 32:02.462
Sure, we do.
Come on.

I don't,
I don't think so.

Okay, I don't think
you're creepy.

33:29.508 --> 33:30.425
Thanks. That means a lot.

33:30.467 --> 33:31.927
But I do think

33:31.969 --> 33:33.512
you're a lot more
stoned than I am,

33:33.553 --> 33:35.514
because this isn't
exactly amazing.

33:35.555 --> 33:37.265
Well, you've got
to be patient.

33:37.307 --> 33:39.184
Yeah.

You know, I should probably
be going pretty soon.

I mean, this is
fun and everything,

No, that was amazing.
I told you.

You okay?

34:35.991 --> 34:38.952
Yeah. I'm sorry, man.

34:38.994 --> 34:40.746
I just...

34:40.786 --> 34:44.541
I guess I'm not comfortable
with the whole gay thing yet.

34:44.583 --> 34:46.418
Yeah, well, neither am I.

34:49.504 --> 34:50.547
Are you okay?

34:50.589 --> 34:53.759
I'm not great.

34:53.800 --> 34:55.427
But I'm better
than I was before

34:55.467 --> 34:56.969
when everything was a secret.

34:57.012 --> 34:59.347
Yeah, it must have been rough.

34:59.389 --> 35:02.350
Yeah.

35:02.392 --> 35:03.852
Yeah.

35:05.020 --> 35:08.607
I-I guess... the thing is,

35:08.648 --> 35:11.735
I felt like I knew you before,
but, you know, clearly I didn't.

35:11.777 --> 35:13.486
Look, I'm still the same person.

35:13.528 --> 35:14.947
And so am I.

35:14.988 --> 35:18.784
I just don't know
how to... act around you.

35:21.661 --> 35:24.706
I mean, I'm definitely not going
to start acting like those guys.

35:24.748 --> 35:26.083
(Teddy chuckles)

35:26.124 --> 35:28.794
I'm glad to hear it.

35:28.835 --> 35:30.712
You know, this really
isn't my scene either.

35:30.754 --> 35:31.880
So what's your scene?

35:33.048 --> 35:34.466
I don't know.

35:36.843 --> 35:38.553
I don't know where
I belong anymore.

35:38.595 --> 35:39.763
You know what?

35:39.805 --> 35:41.932
You'll figure it out.

35:50.398 --> 35:52.484
Let's get out of here
and grab a burger or something.

35:52.525 --> 35:53.735

Nah. They look like
they're having fun.

Navid's got some moves, huh?

36:05.580 --> 36:06.999
Yeah, who knew, huh?

NAOMI:
Thank you so much
for coming over.

36:12.754 --> 36:14.673
I really appreciate it.
It's okay.

36:14.714 --> 36:16.591
I'm TiVoing the
Torchwood marathon.

36:16.633 --> 36:18.677
So can you find
my pictures?

36:18.718 --> 36:20.887
Because if you can't, I do not
know what I'm going to do.

36:20.929 --> 36:23.849
I can't join the chess club.
A-- it's too nerdy,

36:23.890 --> 36:26.101
and B-- I have no idea
how to play chess.

36:26.143 --> 36:27.727
Well, I hate to tell you this,

36:27.769 --> 36:28.770
but your computer
really is fried.

36:28.812 --> 36:30.897
No!

36:30.939 --> 36:34.442
Well, Naomi, please calm down.

36:34.484 --> 36:35.819
Here.

36:35.861 --> 36:36.945
What are you doing?

36:36.987 --> 36:39.489
I'm finding your pictures.

36:39.531 --> 36:41.533
On your computer?

36:41.574 --> 36:42.575
Yeah. Go ahead and log in.

36:43.994 --> 36:44.953
But I...

36:53.628 --> 36:55.714

36:56.965 --> 36:59.634
Oh, my pictures!

36:59.676 --> 37:01.761
I installed Live Mesh the last
time I was on your computer.

37:01.803 --> 37:04.014
I couldn't believe you
had no backup system.

37:04.056 --> 37:05.849
That's like walking around
with no underwear.

37:05.891 --> 37:06.516
What's wrong with that?

37:08.935 --> 37:12.147
Well, now all your work
automatically backs up

37:12.189 --> 37:14.983
Oh, my God, thank you!
Thank you!

37:15.025 --> 37:16.401

Good luck with your photo shoot.

37:32.876 --> 37:35.003
Hey, Naomi,

37:35.045 --> 37:37.005

about me being hot?

37:37.047 --> 37:38.173
I was, uh...

37:38.215 --> 37:40.217
I, uh...

37:40.258 --> 37:41.885
Hold that thought.

37:43.011 --> 37:44.596
What thought?

37:53.772 --> 37:56.149
Oh...

37:56.191 --> 37:58.110
I can't stop
thinking about you.

37:58.151 --> 38:01.071
You better not say anything
about this to anyone.

38:09.871 --> 38:11.748
I'm sorry, Naomi.

38:11.790 --> 38:12.916
I'm flattered,

38:12.958 --> 38:15.043
but...

38:15.085 --> 38:16.294

38:24.761 --> 38:27.889

38:39.901 --> 38:41.778
Yeah, not well is right.

38:41.820 --> 38:43.196
I don't get it.

Why would you do
something like this?

over without notice,

Okay, what we're going
to show you here today

40:00.439 --> 40:02.275

presentation,

It's basically a short
version of the pilot,

40:04.485 --> 40:07.239
with the credit sequence.
It'll give the studios a flavor
of what we're going for.

40:07.280 --> 40:09.782
We're thinking The Hills
meets The Kardashians.

40:09.824 --> 40:11.117
Meets something sexier

40:11.159 --> 40:12.827
and crazier.
Ooh, I love it.

40:12.869 --> 40:14.746

footage you sent us

40:14.787 --> 40:16.289
