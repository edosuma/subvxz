00:41.834 --> 00:45.838
<i>Josh is rotting in jail</i>

00:45.838 --> 00:49.842
<i>For the death of Elsie Vale</i>

00:50.551 --> 00:53.804
<i>Oh, Josh, why did you do it?</i>

00:53.804 --> 00:56.557
I didn't. Aren't you omniscient?

00:57.266 --> 00:59.017
Am I? Who knows?

00:59.893 --> 01:00.894
You.

01:01.937 --> 01:04.105
Anyway, Melissa's getting me a lawyer.
I'll be fine.

01:05.232 --> 01:07.818
<i>No, you're destined to rue it</i>

01:07.818 --> 01:11.822
<i>When they send you to the chair</i>

01:11.822 --> 01:17.077
<i>Schmiga-dee-death penalty</i>

01:18.787 --> 01:19.788
Come on.

01:20.539 --> 01:22.207
How often do they use the chair here?

01:25.294 --> 01:27.671
Okay, maybe once in a while.

01:29.882 --> 01:32.509
But even in the darkest depths of despair,

01:32.509 --> 01:38.265
suddenly there appears, in such
surprising guise, an unexpected friend.

01:39.099 --> 01:40.100
Friend? What do you mean?

01:40.976 --> 01:42.227
Keep walking.

01:42.227 --> 01:44.062
- In here, punk.
- For what?

01:44.062 --> 01:45.856
Disorderly conduct, unlawful assembly,

01:45.856 --> 01:48.233
and peddling parables
with no clear takeaways.

01:49.193 --> 01:50.819
I was just spreading joy, man.

01:51.320 --> 01:52.988
Looks like you could use a little.

01:52.988 --> 01:55.240
Save it for your salad, you freak.

01:55.991 --> 01:59.661
You kids with your ideals
and your protest,

01:59.661 --> 02:02.623
and your determination
to live your dreams.

01:59.745 --> 02:02.623
and your determination
to live your dreams.

02:02.623 --> 02:04.458
Peace and love, peace and love.

02:05.209 --> 02:08.169
How about "shut" and "up"?

02:10.756 --> 02:12.174
I love you, Sergeant Rivera.

02:12.716 --> 02:14.551
Anger is just sadness that can't get out.

02:16.720 --> 02:18.347
See you in hell.

02:22.392 --> 02:24.811
- Hey, man.
- You gotta be kidding me.

02:24.811 --> 02:27.105
I'm Topher. Peace.

02:27.105 --> 02:30.234
Hi, I'm Josh.

02:32.194 --> 02:35.155
- What are you in for, Josh?
- Murder. But I didn't do it. I'm innocent.

02:35.155 --> 02:37.324
Don't worry. I believe you.

02:37.324 --> 02:39.660
Thanks. I appreciate it.

02:39.660 --> 02:43.247
Hey! Me too! I'm innocent too.

02:43.247 --> 02:45.457
- I believe you.
- And I didn't rob that bank.

02:45.457 --> 02:46.500
I believe you.

02:46.500 --> 02:50.003
- Yeah, and I never touched that girl.
- I believe you too, Conrad.

02:50.003 --> 02:51.755
- Of course you-- Yep.
- I believe all of you.

02:51.755 --> 02:53.173
I think you all should be free.

02:54.800 --> 02:55.634
Great.

02:57.386 --> 03:00.347
I know the situation looks bleak, Josh.
But don't despair.

03:00.347 --> 03:02.266
You probably got it better than you think.

03:02.266 --> 03:04.101
I mean, look at me.

03:04.101 --> 03:07.896
I'm 30 years old and still haven't
figured out my purpose in life.

03:08.730 --> 03:09.731
This about you now?

03:09.731 --> 03:11.900
I always felt that I was special,
you know.

03:11.900 --> 03:14.027
That I was destined to do something great.

03:14.611 --> 03:16.321
I just don't know
what that something is yet.

03:18.156 --> 03:23.495
<i>This life is like a puzzle
You gotta find that missing piece</i>

03:24.371 --> 03:28.667
<i>And the man who does
Will find his happiness increase</i>

03:29.293 --> 03:33.964
<i>Poets sing of starlight
Kittens play with string</i>

03:33.964 --> 03:39.928
<i>Why does it seem I'll never find my thing?</i>

03:39.928 --> 03:45.184
- Squirrels find nuts in the forest
- Okay.

03:45.184 --> 03:49.354
<i>Robins fly high in the air</i>

03:50.022 --> 03:52.774
<i>What am I supposed to be?</i>

03:52.774 --> 03:55.527
<i>Who is this guy called me?</i>

03:55.527 --> 03:58.363
<i>When will I see</i>

03:58.363 --> 04:04.536
<i>My doorway to where?</i>

03:58.447 --> 04:04.536
<i>My doorway to where?</i>

04:04.536 --> 04:06.914
Your doorway to where?

04:06.914 --> 04:12.461
<i>Starfish have the ocean
And all our socks go in a drawer</i>

04:13.086 --> 04:17.882
<i>All I've got's this notion
That I'm meant for something more</i>

04:17.882 --> 04:22.846
<i>Corks belong in bottles
Spiders eat their young</i>

04:22.846 --> 04:29.269
<i>My life's a song that's waiting to be sung</i>

04:29.269 --> 04:34.483
- Camels make love in the desert
- Don't do that.

04:34.483 --> 04:38.028
<i>A table works best with a chair</i>

04:39.363 --> 04:44.368
<i>What am I supposed to be?
Who is this guy called me?</i>

04:44.368 --> 04:47.579
<i>When will I see</i>

04:47.579 --> 04:54.169
<i>My doorway to where?</i>

04:54.711 --> 04:59.925
<i>My doorway to where</i>

04:59.925 --> 05:06.640
<i>My doorway to where</i>

05:17.860 --> 05:20.237
Hey, man, it's gonna be okay.

05:20.237 --> 05:21.321
You're young.

05:21.321 --> 05:25.200
You've got hair, like, so much hair.

05:25.200 --> 05:26.702
You just have to be patient.

05:26.702 --> 05:30.330
Also, you a rich white boy. Ya fine.

05:31.790 --> 05:34.042
Thanks, man. You know what?

05:34.042 --> 05:37.796
I am gonna make it my personal mission
to get you on the happiness bus.

05:38.463 --> 05:39.715
The happiness bus?

05:40.340 --> 05:41.717
Hap-- Is that a clue?

05:41.717 --> 05:42.885
Narrator?

05:42.885 --> 05:44.344
It's the grooviest.

05:44.344 --> 05:48.015
All you need to get on board... is love.

05:51.018 --> 05:52.644
No, what I need is a lawyer.

05:57.566 --> 06:00.319
Excuse me. I'm looking for Mr. Flanagan.

06:00.986 --> 06:03.197
Please. Mr. Flanagan is my father.

06:03.197 --> 06:05.699
After he lost his medical license.

06:05.699 --> 06:06.825
Call me Bobby.

06:06.825 --> 06:09.536
Right, yeah. Duh. I'm sorry about that.

06:09.536 --> 06:13.957
But also, yes, okay, lady lawyer.

06:13.957 --> 06:16.627
- Being a lady lawyer is no big deal.
- Oh, no, yes.

06:16.627 --> 06:18.587
I agree. I'm a doctor.

06:18.587 --> 06:21.423
It's not like we expect to be judges.
We're not crazy!

06:21.423 --> 06:22.758
Except right before our monthlies.

06:23.759 --> 06:24.593
There it is.

06:24.593 --> 06:27.429
Yeah, I was just hoping
you could help my husband, Josh.

06:27.429 --> 06:30.349
Who's in jail for killing Elsie Vale,
the showgirl.

06:31.016 --> 06:33.143
Nothing happens in Schmicago
without me knowing.

06:33.143 --> 06:34.770
And then nothing happens
till I get my retainer,

06:34.770 --> 06:37.105
and I'm the most expensive lawyer in town.

06:37.105 --> 06:39.274
You think you could scrape together
a sawbuck?

06:39.274 --> 06:43.153
I don't know what that is,
but I went to the ATM before we left.

06:43.153 --> 06:45.072
So here's a 20.

06:46.907 --> 06:49.326
Well, well, Mrs. Moneybags.

06:49.826 --> 06:52.412
You just bought yourself some eye contact.

06:53.872 --> 06:54.998
Great. So...

06:57.626 --> 06:59.837
You probably wanna know more about me.

07:02.089 --> 07:04.424
Well, what is there to tell?
It's the classic story.

07:04.424 --> 07:10.848
I got my BA from BU, my LLD from NYU,
and my L-E-Gs from G-O-D.

07:12.057 --> 07:18.230
Law school was a world full of ''No!''
No, no, no, no, no, no!

07:18.230 --> 07:20.482
But after a while, I caught on.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.861
You see, the world kept telling me, "no."

07:23.861 --> 07:27.781
But turns out "no"
doesn't always mean "no."

07:29.199 --> 07:30.617
Uncomfortable with that.

07:30.617 --> 07:33.745
But you've had success
with cases like Josh's?

07:33.745 --> 07:35.497
Bobby doesn't dwell on the past.

07:35.497 --> 07:39.001
Bobby stays in the present tense.
Third person.

07:40.586 --> 07:42.296
So, here's what we're gonna do.

07:42.296 --> 07:44.006
First, we court the press.

07:44.006 --> 07:45.465
Then I press the court.

07:45.465 --> 07:49.678
Believe me. Once I've worked my magic,
no jury will ever convict your hubby,

07:49.678 --> 07:50.804
even if he kills again.

07:50.804 --> 07:53.473
And just to be clear, Josh didn't do it.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.934
Uh-huh.
Well, if you're so sure about that,

07:55.934 --> 07:57.853
why don't you help him
by finding the real killer?

07:57.853 --> 07:59.229
Me? How?

07:59.229 --> 08:01.315
I'd recommend the standard play.

07:59.313 --> 08:01.315
I'd recommend the standard play.

08:01.315 --> 08:03.817
Get a job dancing at the club
where Elsie was killed.

08:03.817 --> 08:05.277
Snoop around. See what you can find out.

08:05.277 --> 08:06.653
That's the standard play?

08:07.321 --> 08:09.656
The auditions for the open slot
are today at noon.

08:09.656 --> 08:11.617
What are you,
an eleven-and-a-half character shoe?

08:11.617 --> 08:12.826
I'm so-- Confession.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.620
I'm not much of a dancer.

08:14.620 --> 08:16.788
In theater camp,
I was more of a double threat.

08:16.788 --> 08:17.748
Here.

08:18.457 --> 08:21.668
I'm off to meet my new client
and bamboozle the press.

08:21.668 --> 08:24.171
Break a leg at that audition,
Twinkle Toes.

08:25.589 --> 08:27.382
Your hubby's life may depend on it.

08:32.971 --> 08:36.850
You've all got big dreams,
hungry for fame.

08:36.850 --> 08:39.937
I can feel the heat of it coming off
of you like baked hams.

08:39.937 --> 08:45.359
But fame will cost you
sweat, dignity, even cash.

08:45.359 --> 08:48.320
Oh, no, I don't take checks,
so don't ask me.

08:49.196 --> 08:54.284
We are looking for a dancer
as good as Elsie was before she died.

08:54.284 --> 08:55.869
So don't hold back.

08:55.869 --> 08:59.873
Let's do the whole combination,
facing away from the wall.

08:59.873 --> 09:01.542
<i>Fünf, sechs, sieben, acht!</i>

08:59.957 --> 09:01.542
<i>Fünf, sechs, sieben, acht!</i>

09:08.006 --> 09:10.217
Again! Fünf, sechs, sieben, acht!

09:19.351 --> 09:22.437
<i>I need to eat
I need to eat</i>

09:22.437 --> 09:26.483
<i>Last night my dinner was a candle
Last night my dinner was a candle</i>

09:26.483 --> 09:29.278
<i>The landlord's calling
I'm out of fishnets</i>

09:29.278 --> 09:32.614
<i>There's not much more that I can handle
There's not much more that I can</i>

09:32.614 --> 09:37.828
<i>How am I gonna feed my kids?
Why did I have so many kids?</i>

09:37.828 --> 09:40.747
<i>I think I'm gonna have to sell my kids</i>

09:42.165 --> 09:43.166
Sorry, I'm late.

09:50.591 --> 09:51.842
Hi, everybody.

09:52.509 --> 09:54.469
<i>Eins, zwei, drei, vier, fünf, sechs!</i>

09:56.430 --> 10:00.934
Wow. You guys are all so thin
and elegant and angular.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.644
I feel like a wildebeest next to you.

10:08.775 --> 10:11.486
<i>Who is this girl?
She's really bad</i>

10:11.486 --> 10:13.780
- Hey!
- She oughta be way in the back

10:13.780 --> 10:15.991
- She oughta be way in the
- Okay, I can hear you.

10:15.991 --> 10:20.162
<i>This girl has got no sense of space
And does a weird thing with her face</i>

10:20.162 --> 10:23.081
<i>She pops her head
And she's got bad feet</i>

10:23.624 --> 10:25.584
All right, so you can dance.

10:25.584 --> 10:28.170
Some of you. But that is not enough.

10:28.170 --> 10:30.214
I want to know why you are here.

10:32.883 --> 10:35.552
I guess it all started
when my parents' marriage fell apart.

10:35.552 --> 10:38.138
The marriage counselor's office
was next to a dance studio.

10:38.972 --> 10:41.558
I used to sneak in there and stomp around
to drown out the sound

10:41.558 --> 10:44.561
of Mother and Daddy fighting over
whose life was more disappointing.

10:45.270 --> 10:47.564
The next thing I knew,
I was pointing my feet.

10:48.148 --> 10:51.026
And falling in love with guys
that didn't want me that way.

10:53.111 --> 10:54.947
Dad was in the military.

10:54.947 --> 10:56.823
You know, the type with a whistle.

10:56.823 --> 10:58.951
He used to force my brothers, sisters,

10:58.951 --> 11:01.245
and me to perform for guests
at dinner parties.

10:59.034 --> 11:01.245
and me to perform for guests
at dinner parties.

11:01.245 --> 11:03.038
God, I hated when he did that.

11:03.038 --> 11:05.999
So, this one night,
I begged him for a taste of champagne.

11:05.999 --> 11:09.878
He said, "no,"
but I didn't let that stop me. Oh, no.

11:09.878 --> 11:11.713
He had a girlfriend, real fancy.

11:11.713 --> 11:14.341
She had some kind of royal title.
I kid you not.

11:14.341 --> 11:17.261
Later that night,
she gave me the whole damn bottle.

11:17.886 --> 11:19.221
That's when I started class.

11:21.557 --> 11:22.558
Why am I here?

11:22.558 --> 11:25.352
I grew up in Buffalo
and went through puberty.

11:25.352 --> 11:26.436
That's it.

11:26.436 --> 11:28.814
Puberty. Buffalo.

11:33.026 --> 11:35.320
Wow. You guys have been through so much.

11:35.320 --> 11:36.947
I feel bad, even competing

11:36.947 --> 11:39.783
or assuming your lives are better
because you're so thin and beautiful.

11:39.783 --> 11:40.868
But maybe--

11:40.868 --> 11:44.246
<i>I am a doctor
And a doctor doctors</i>

11:44.246 --> 11:47.624
<i>I'm proud to be called an MD</i>

11:48.250 --> 11:52.171
<i>But every time I deliver a baby</i>

11:52.171 --> 11:57.259
<i>I wonder when that'll be me</i>

11:57.259 --> 12:02.347
<i>Even when I perform to perfection
Shoulder dystocia</i>

11:57.342 --> 12:02.347
<i>Even when I perform to perfection
Shoulder dystocia</i>

12:02.347 --> 12:05.601
<i>Emergency C-section</i>

12:05.601 --> 12:09.104
<i>The days can be pretty rough</i>

12:09.605 --> 12:14.026
<i>And I feel like I'll never ever be enough</i>

12:14.818 --> 12:16.945
<i>So this size 12</i>

12:16.945 --> 12:21.325
<i>Would love the chance to shine</i>

12:21.950 --> 12:24.661
<i>And also clear my husband of murder</i>

12:25.245 --> 12:28.165
Enough talk! Now dance for your life!

12:46.642 --> 12:49.937
<i>I need to eat tonight</i>

12:49.937 --> 12:53.440
<i>Not work the street tonight</i>

12:53.440 --> 13:00.405
<i>I need to eat tonight</i>

12:53.524 --> 13:00.405
<i>I need to eat tonight</i>

13:01.365 --> 13:02.366
Wait. We're doing that.

13:12.835 --> 13:14.294
I have made my decision.

13:15.087 --> 13:19.091
Your stories are most compelling,
but I must hire the best dancer.

13:21.134 --> 13:22.302
One second.

13:25.722 --> 13:27.683
That was pretty intense, huh?

13:27.683 --> 13:30.769
You're kidding. Really? Are you sure?

13:31.520 --> 13:33.939
- Did you see her?
- You heard Uncle Octavius.

13:36.108 --> 13:38.735
Mr. Kratt. Do it.

13:44.241 --> 13:46.785
You. You've got the job.

13:47.661 --> 13:48.662
Wow.

13:49.329 --> 13:54.585
I-- Okay. Well, I just wanna say
it is really been a true privilege

13:54.585 --> 13:56.795
- to dance with all of-- Yeah.
- Shut it.

13:58.297 --> 13:59.423
One of those things.

13:59.423 --> 14:00.757
Only one spot, you know.

13:59.506 --> 14:00.757
Only one spot, you know.

14:03.218 --> 14:05.929
To be honest, hair like this,
it's a burden.

14:05.929 --> 14:07.431
Gets caught in trees.

14:07.431 --> 14:09.766
You have to worry about fleas.

14:09.766 --> 14:12.186
Gets messed up by the breeze.

14:16.940 --> 14:19.860
<i>Here comes Bobby</i>

14:19.860 --> 14:21.111
Who?

14:21.111 --> 14:24.865
<i>Here comes Bobby now</i>

14:25.741 --> 14:27.659
Hello, boys.

14:29.494 --> 14:33.624
<i>Here comes Bobby
Bobby, baby</i>

14:33.624 --> 14:36.251
<i>Wowzah wowzah wow</i>

14:36.251 --> 14:37.544
Is everybody here?

14:37.544 --> 14:39.838
- Is everybody happy?
- Oh, yeah!

14:39.838 --> 14:43.967
<i>Help us, Bobby</i>

14:43.967 --> 14:48.222
<i>Help us, Bobby, please</i>

14:48.222 --> 14:50.265
<i>Help us, Bobby</i>

14:50.265 --> 14:55.103
<i>Get us off on technicalities</i>

14:55.103 --> 14:56.396
Not now, fellas.

14:56.396 --> 15:00.776
Much as I'd like to give you the time,
I simply cannot handle your appeal.

14:56.480 --> 15:00.776
Much as I'd like to give you the time,
I simply cannot handle your appeal.

15:02.861 --> 15:06.990
<i>Bobby</i>

15:06.990 --> 15:09.868
<i>Wowzah wowzah wow!</i>

15:12.204 --> 15:13.705
Bobby Flanagan, Attorney at Law.

15:13.705 --> 15:16.792
Your mistress hired me.
Tall brunette. Kind of "complain-y."

15:17.376 --> 15:18.335
That's my wife.

15:18.836 --> 15:20.963
So, do you think
you can get me out of here?

15:20.963 --> 15:23.006
I don't know.
But I'm gonna get paid trying.

15:23.006 --> 15:25.467
First things first, don't tell me
why you did it. I don't need to know.

15:25.467 --> 15:27.469
- I didn't do it.
- Don't need to know that either.

15:27.469 --> 15:28.846
Just do what I tell you.

15:28.846 --> 15:31.598
Winning a case is all about flimflam,
flapdoodle, and pizzazz.

15:31.598 --> 15:32.975
Flapdoodle?

15:33.475 --> 15:36.103
The law is 10% precedent and 90% wow.

15:36.728 --> 15:38.856
Lucky for you, I'm very good at wow.

15:38.856 --> 15:41.483
Your press conference starts in an hour.
I'll see you then.

15:41.483 --> 15:43.277
In an hour? Wait--

15:43.861 --> 15:45.571
Press conference? But--

15:45.571 --> 15:49.658
<i>Help us, Bobby</i>

15:49.658 --> 15:53.787
<i>Help us, Bobby, please</i>

15:53.787 --> 15:55.998
<i>Help us, Bobby</i>

15:55.998 --> 16:00.752
<i>Get us off on technicalities</i>

15:56.081 --> 16:00.752
<i>Get us off on technicalities</i>

16:00.752 --> 16:03.630
I'm working on it, boys.
I'm working on it.

16:04.256 --> 16:05.883
<i>Bobby!</i>

16:05.883 --> 16:07.009
But--

16:16.935 --> 16:18.812
I mean, I was surprised
when you said it was me,

16:18.812 --> 16:20.731
but I must have something, right?

16:20.731 --> 16:23.192
- Sure.
- What's behind this door?

16:23.692 --> 16:26.486
Off-limits. Dead girl schmutz.

16:27.070 --> 16:30.324
Rehearsal in one hour.
Don't shave anything.

16:31.200 --> 16:34.203
- Here's some rouge for your knees.
- My knees?

16:34.203 --> 16:35.954
You think they need contour?

16:38.916 --> 16:42.211
Oh, Melissa. Thank heavens.
I have been so worried.

16:42.211 --> 16:43.212
I heard about Josh,

16:43.212 --> 16:45.255
and I want you to know
that I don't believe a single word of it!

16:45.255 --> 16:48.258
My chum Josh couldn't have killed Elsie!
He's too, too divine!

16:48.258 --> 16:49.927
And I'm never wrong about people.

16:50.719 --> 16:51.803
Thank you.

16:51.803 --> 16:53.722
And now
you're gonna be working at the club!

16:53.722 --> 16:55.098
I can't wait to take you under my wing

16:55.098 --> 16:56.892
and teach you absolutely everything
that I know!

16:56.892 --> 16:58.560
Oh, no. Jenny, you don't have to do that.

16:58.560 --> 17:01.855
No, I insist. I just hope you won't let
stardom go to your head too fast.

16:58.644 --> 17:01.855
No, I insist. I just hope you won't let
stardom go to your head too fast.

17:01.855 --> 17:04.358
Oh, no, stop. And who are you again?

17:05.943 --> 17:07.944
Oh, Melissa, you are such a panic!

17:07.944 --> 17:10.113
- I mean...
- It's gonna be absolutely marvelous

17:10.113 --> 17:13.784
having you around!
In fact, you should be my roommate.

17:14.617 --> 17:17.204
Oh, really? Wait, you mean--

17:17.204 --> 17:18.914
Well, poor old Elsie
isn't using her bedroom anymore

17:18.914 --> 17:20.958
now that she's dead.
And I'm so easy to live with.

17:20.958 --> 17:22.751
I dash all day,
and I dash even more at night.

17:23.752 --> 17:25.921
Yeah,
it could be useful for me to be there.

17:25.921 --> 17:28.382
I mean, for you to teach me
and everything.

17:28.882 --> 17:32.052
And, you know,
maybe you could tell me more about Elsie

17:32.052 --> 17:33.762
and who may have wanted to kill her.

17:33.762 --> 17:35.681
I'm sure we have much more
interesting things to discuss

17:35.681 --> 17:37.850
other than some gruesome unsolved murder.

17:37.850 --> 17:40.894
So it's decided. You'll move in,
and we will have nothing but fun.

17:41.395 --> 17:43.313
And bad things will never happen
ever again.

17:45.524 --> 17:47.109
Does anyone have two cigarettes?

17:47.109 --> 17:49.194
My roommate, Melissa,
and I are simply desperate.

17:49.194 --> 17:51.488
Oh, no. I'm actually fine.
I don't smoke, so...

17:53.824 --> 17:56.034
Okay. Wow. That actually looks incredible.

17:57.870 --> 17:59.496
I don't think I can go through with this.

17:59.496 --> 18:01.415
Of course you can.
Just stick to the script, kid.

17:59.580 --> 18:01.415
Of course you can.
Just stick to the script, kid.

18:02.082 --> 18:04.835
Gentlemen and gentlemen of the press,

18:04.835 --> 18:07.588
you all know me,
Bobby Flanagan, Attorney at Law.

18:07.588 --> 18:09.965
- Sure do.
- Oh, stop.

18:09.965 --> 18:13.385
I'm here with my client,
the accused murderer, Josh Skinner.

18:13.969 --> 18:17.639
The question is not, "Did Josh Skinner
brutally murder Elsie Vale?"

18:17.639 --> 18:19.683
- It's not?
- The real question is,

18:19.683 --> 18:21.560
"What drove him to it?"

18:21.560 --> 18:23.854
My client will now read
from a prepared statement.

18:26.023 --> 18:27.024
Yep.

18:28.317 --> 18:30.736
"Elsie Vale did not deserve to die.

18:30.736 --> 18:33.488
But now she is dead, and I am in jail.
Why?

18:33.488 --> 18:37.451
This tragedy and my part in it
can only be blamed on one thing.

18:40.913 --> 18:41.955
Jazz."

18:42.456 --> 18:43.457
I knew it.

18:43.457 --> 18:44.708
Jazz is to blame again.

18:44.708 --> 18:46.210
- Devil's music.
- Aw, man.

18:46.210 --> 18:48.462
"This was an ugly crime of passion

18:48.462 --> 18:51.340
brought about by shameless music
mixed with liquor"?

18:51.965 --> 18:56.094
Jazz and booze.
They go together every time!

18:56.094 --> 18:58.263
I'll drink to that!

18:58.972 --> 19:04.811
"I am so ashamed
that I let jazz infect my soul.

19:05.395 --> 19:06.855
I'm sorry for what I did,

19:06.855 --> 19:10.901
and I will never again
listen to such evil, improvisatory,

19:10.901 --> 19:12.569
harmonically complex..."

19:13.070 --> 19:14.780
-"...melodies, such as"--
- Yeah.

19:14.780 --> 19:17.199
- Why'd you stop? Keep going.
- I can't do this.

19:17.199 --> 19:21.411
I can't stand here and say
I murdered somebody because of jazz.

19:21.995 --> 19:24.623
I mean, I pretend to like jazz
like everybody else.

19:24.623 --> 19:27.709
But come on, jazz did not kill Elsie Vale.

19:28.293 --> 19:29.169
Right on.

19:29.169 --> 19:30.796
My client is delirious.

19:30.796 --> 19:33.048
Stand back, everyone.
His case of jazz is worse than we thought.

19:33.048 --> 19:36.635
- So you're not sorry for what you did?
- No, of course not. I didn't do anything.

19:36.635 --> 19:39.012
Killer says he's not sorry!

19:39.012 --> 19:41.223
- How is there already a paper?
- Would you do it again?

19:41.223 --> 19:42.724
Would I not kill her again? Yes.

19:42.724 --> 19:45.352
- Killer says he'll do it again!
- How is he--

19:45.352 --> 19:47.437
Gentlemen, please,
let me confer with my client.

19:47.437 --> 19:50.816
- It's okay, Bobby. We got enough.
- To send him to the chair.

19:53.861 --> 19:59.324
Wait. Come to think of it,
maybe it was jazz.

19:59.324 --> 20:00.742
Come on. Let's go.

19:59.408 --> 20:00.742
Come on. Let's go.

20:01.535 --> 20:02.953
- The last rites?
- I'll call ya.

20:07.374 --> 20:08.959
Josh? Josh!

20:09.543 --> 20:11.378
- Mel! Over here!
- Josh!

20:11.378 --> 20:15.132
- Hey! I have great news.
- Oh, God. Thank God. Yes.

20:15.132 --> 20:17.759
- I got the job.
- What job?

20:17.759 --> 20:19.553
I'm the new dancer at the club.

20:19.553 --> 20:23.056
Yeah, somehow,
I guess I nailed the audition.

20:23.056 --> 20:24.641
Hey, that's great.

20:25.225 --> 20:27.936
- Wow. Okay. Well, thank you.
- Wow.

20:27.936 --> 20:29.104
This is nice.

20:29.104 --> 20:33.192
I am really happy
that you nailed the audition, sweetie.

20:33.192 --> 20:36.195
But I'm also just a little concerned
that I'm going to be executed

20:36.195 --> 20:38.405
- for a murder I didn't commit.
- Yes. Right. Elsie.

20:38.405 --> 20:39.698
- And you being framed. I know.
- Yeah.

20:39.698 --> 20:41.158
I'm so sorry. I think I just--

20:41.158 --> 20:44.036
I got caught up
in the glitz and the glamour of it all.

20:44.036 --> 20:46.121
- But, hey, listen, I only did all this...
- That's okay.

20:46.121 --> 20:48.290
...so I could find evidence
to get you out of here.

20:49.625 --> 20:50.876
It's the standard play.

20:51.585 --> 20:53.504
Thank you, sweetie.

20:53.504 --> 20:55.672
- I really appreciate that.
- I got-- Yeah.

20:56.548 --> 20:59.301
Wow. That was really beautiful.

20:59.885 --> 21:02.763
- This is Topher.
- Wow.

21:04.306 --> 21:06.433
Nice to meet you, Topher.

21:06.433 --> 21:08.936
- You look groovy.
- Thanks.

21:08.936 --> 21:10.812
Man, I wish I had what you guys have.

21:12.397 --> 21:13.440
I keep searching.

21:13.440 --> 21:14.983
This is not about you, Topher.

21:15.776 --> 21:17.069
Right. Sorry.

21:17.069 --> 21:19.279
Well, so how was the press conference?

21:19.279 --> 21:24.034
Not great. I went off script,
and now everyone wants me dead.

21:24.034 --> 21:25.244
- Oh, Josh.
- Do you--

21:25.244 --> 21:27.120
Do you think I could actually die in here?

21:27.996 --> 21:30.624
Definitely. That's what makes this
all so entertaining.

21:31.458 --> 21:32.292
Entertaining? I--

21:32.292 --> 21:34.753
You know what? Just ignore him,
and maybe he'll go away.

21:34.753 --> 21:35.921
You don't know me.

21:38.173 --> 21:39.007
You missed.

21:39.007 --> 21:41.260
- On purpose.
- Hey, listen to me.

21:41.260 --> 21:43.595
We can get you out of here
because I'm on the case.

21:43.595 --> 21:46.598
I didn't just get Elsie's old job.
I moved into her apartment.

21:46.598 --> 21:47.975
So I can dig up clues

21:47.975 --> 21:51.478
and find out who the real killer is
and prove that you are innocent.

21:51.478 --> 21:53.313
- You really think so?
- I know so.

21:53.313 --> 21:54.982
We're getting you out of here,

21:54.982 --> 21:58.068
and we're gonna get that happy ending,
whatever that means.

21:59.528 --> 22:02.155
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

22:04.116 --> 22:05.367
Man.

22:06.034 --> 22:07.035
Look at you two.

22:08.912 --> 22:10.747
Maybe someday
I'll find what I'm searching for.

22:11.331 --> 22:13.250
This is not about you, Topher.

22:17.713 --> 22:22.134
Well, here it is.
Our oh-so-decadent den of iniquity.

22:23.093 --> 22:24.428
Isn't it just divine?

22:24.428 --> 22:27.514
I mean, this would be 1.8 in Park Slope.

22:29.349 --> 22:30.934
Well, you packed light.

22:30.934 --> 22:33.478
You know what? Feel free
to take any of Elsie's old frocks.

22:33.478 --> 22:34.938
She's definitely not using them.

22:35.522 --> 22:39.318
I don't think anything would fit me.
Sizes seem to run a little small here.

22:39.318 --> 22:41.570
'Course it would.
Everything here has tons of stretch.

22:42.404 --> 22:44.531
Wow. Look at all those flowers.

22:44.531 --> 22:46.825
You must have so many admirers.

22:46.825 --> 22:48.869
Oh, no. These are all from Mr. Kratt.

22:50.037 --> 22:52.539
He owns the club and practically
everything else in Schmicago.

22:52.539 --> 22:53.957
Yeah, I met him.

22:53.957 --> 22:55.417
Isn't he a dear?

22:56.210 --> 22:59.296
I guess you could say that we've been
comforting each other ever since Elsie.

22:59.296 --> 23:03.091
She was his favorite, you know.
But now it seems I am.

22:59.379 --> 23:03.091
She was his favorite, you know.
But now it seems I am.

23:04.968 --> 23:06.678
I mean,
but are you sure that's a good idea?

23:06.678 --> 23:10.599
Just might be a little fast,
and, you know, he's your boss, so...

23:10.599 --> 23:13.060
We have to seize happiness
every chance we get, Melissa.

23:13.060 --> 23:14.478
The world could end tomorrow.

23:16.647 --> 23:19.775
Besides, Mr. Kratt has promised
to make me a big star,

23:19.775 --> 23:21.944
which is all I've ever wanted to be.

23:26.323 --> 23:27.658
It's open!

23:31.537 --> 23:32.371
Ladies.

23:32.371 --> 23:35.791
Mr. Kratt expects you for dinner
in 20 minutes. He wants you to wear this.

23:36.291 --> 23:37.918
- Oh, my God.
- And more flowers?

23:38.502 --> 23:40.546
He's turning me into a bona fide botanist.

23:41.839 --> 23:44.341
I won't be a moment.
I'll do a quick change.

23:52.808 --> 23:54.017
Sure. Yes.

23:54.518 --> 23:57.312
Why don't I just take those?

24:02.651 --> 24:06.321
I hope you realize how fortunate you are
to be performing at the club tonight.

24:07.322 --> 24:09.950
Not everyone that wants to
gets the chance.

24:11.034 --> 24:12.160
Yeah, I bet.

24:12.911 --> 24:17.249
I mean, of course.
God, everyone's gonna miss Elsie so much.

24:17.249 --> 24:19.751
Yes. I've seen you dance.

24:21.128 --> 24:24.423
No. I just--
It's sad what happened to her.

24:25.549 --> 24:26.925
Did you know her well?

24:28.302 --> 24:30.470
- Why do you ask?
- I'm just curious.

24:30.971 --> 24:34.183
If you want to be happy
here in Schmicago, take my advice.

24:35.392 --> 24:38.270
Don't stick your pretty little nose
where it doesn't belong.

24:39.396 --> 24:41.231
You don't want to end up
like your husband.

24:46.528 --> 24:47.738
Ready.

24:47.738 --> 24:49.573
I'm sure we'll be seeing more of you.

24:49.573 --> 24:50.782
Yeah. Have fun.

24:53.452 --> 24:55.370
Melissa, about Mr. Kratt.

24:55.370 --> 24:59.625
I know that I may seem like a silly girl
who does stupid, silly things.

24:59.625 --> 25:01.585
Oh, n-- Jenny. No. That's not my--

24:59.708 --> 25:01.585
Oh, n-- Jenny. No. That's not my--

25:01.585 --> 25:04.421
And I know
that Mr. Kratt and I are an odd item,

25:04.421 --> 25:08.592
but I'm just doing what I need to do
to survive. Like all of us.

25:12.346 --> 25:13.347
Toodles!

25:17.935 --> 25:21.230
Okay. Clues. Clues.

25:21.230 --> 25:24.107
Looking for clues.

25:25.734 --> 25:27.694
Okay. I wonder if this is a clue.

25:29.530 --> 25:31.490
Maybe I should try it on.

25:34.243 --> 25:36.995
<i>Do-do-de-doot
Do-do-de-doot</i>

25:36.995 --> 25:38.705
<i>Doo-doo-doot de-doot doot!</i>

25:39.373 --> 25:43.794
<i>When we met you promised me the stars</i>

25:44.586 --> 25:49.174
<i>But now your love
Feels more like prison bars</i>

25:49.174 --> 25:52.177
<i>Somehow I'm doing time</i>

25:52.177 --> 25:54.388
<i>Convicted of no crime</i>

25:54.388 --> 25:59.184
<i>So before you get
To handing out cigars</i>

25:59.184 --> 26:01.395
<i>I'm bustin' out</i>

25:59.268 --> 26:01.395
<i>I'm bustin' out</i>

26:01.395 --> 26:03.981
<i>Buh-buh-buh-buh bustin' out</i>

26:03.981 --> 26:09.528
<i>Buh-baby, I'll do without
All of those chains that bound me</i>

26:10.112 --> 26:12.489
<i>All those years that you controlled me</i>

26:12.489 --> 26:14.950
<i>Now there's no way you can hold me</i>

26:14.950 --> 26:19.913
<i>Sorry, dear, there's no preventing
Me from leaving your San Quentin</i>

26:22.708 --> 26:24.126
What's that?

26:24.126 --> 26:25.335
They're here.

26:27.671 --> 26:29.214
Come on, Topher! Let's roll!

26:29.214 --> 26:31.675
- Man, I knew you guys would show up.
- What?

26:33.051 --> 26:35.429
So, Josh, are you ready
to get on the happiness bus?

26:35.429 --> 26:37.681
It's literal?
I thought that was a metaphor.

26:37.681 --> 26:40.267
No, it's real, man.
And there's a seat waiting just for you.

26:40.267 --> 26:42.227
I don't know. I don't know if I should.

26:42.227 --> 26:44.938
Although, it's the happiness bus.
And the Leprechaun said--

26:44.938 --> 26:47.733
We gotta go, man. The fuzz are coming!

26:47.733 --> 26:49.443
<i>Bustin' out</i>

26:49.443 --> 26:51.528
<i>Buh-buh-buh-buh bustin' out</i>

26:52.070 --> 26:53.864
<i>Buh-baby, now there's no doubt</i>

26:54.573 --> 26:57.993
<i>I'm not gonna let you hound me</i>

26:57.993 --> 27:00.370
<i>Once a life alone was scary</i>

26:58.076 --> 27:00.370
<i>Once a life alone was scary</i>

27:00.370 --> 27:02.873
<i>But I can't wait for solitary</i>

27:02.873 --> 27:05.042
<i>Need a love with more pizzazz</i>

27:05.042 --> 27:07.836
<i>I'm tired of this Alcatraz</i>

27:07.836 --> 27:08.837
Come on, Josh.

27:08.837 --> 27:11.465
Do you really want to put your faith
in a corrupt legal system?

27:12.883 --> 27:14.551
- I--
- Think about your life, Josh.

27:14.551 --> 27:16.178
The happiness bus is calling your name.

27:16.178 --> 27:17.387
- Josh, Josh, Josh.
- Josh, Josh.

27:17.387 --> 27:20.390
Josh, Josh, Josh! Josh, Josh, Josh!

27:21.642 --> 27:24.186
<i>Do-do-de-doot
Do-do-de-doot</i>

27:24.186 --> 27:25.270
- Doo-doo
- Doo-doo

27:25.270 --> 27:26.396
<i>Doo</i>

27:26.396 --> 27:27.814
<i>Bustin' out</i>

27:28.315 --> 27:30.275
<i>Buh-buh-buh-buh bustin' out</i>

27:30.776 --> 27:33.195
<i>Buh-baby, it's time to shout</i>

27:33.195 --> 27:36.365
<i>I'm done with these walls around me</i>

27:36.365 --> 27:38.867
<i>Made me think you were my savior</i>

27:38.867 --> 27:41.703
<i>But now I'm out on bad behavior</i>

27:41.703 --> 27:43.580
<i>I'll go any place on Earth</i>

27:43.580 --> 27:46.124
<i>Just to escape your Leavenworth</i>

27:46.124 --> 27:48.252
- I'm bustin' out
- Josh, Josh, Josh, Josh...

27:48.252 --> 27:51.171
- Buh-buh-buh-buh bustin' out
- All right. Let's do this!

27:51.171 --> 27:53.298
- Buh-baby, it's time to flout
- Come on!

27:53.298 --> 27:56.426
<i>The finger 'round which you wound me</i>

27:56.426 --> 27:58.720
<i>I'm so sick of all your gripes</i>

27:58.720 --> 28:01.098
<i>You know I don't look good in stripes</i>

27:58.804 --> 28:01.098
<i>You know I don't look good in stripes</i>

28:01.098 --> 28:06.186
<i>I'm bustin', bustin' out!</i>

28:06.186 --> 28:08.814
<i>There's no glamour in the slammer
so I'm bustin' out!</i>

28:18.699 --> 28:19.908
Wow.

28:20.576 --> 28:23.203
You were wonderful, darling.
They adored you.

28:23.203 --> 28:25.706
I could feel it. Like, that was amazing.

28:25.706 --> 28:27.332
You really think they loved it?

28:27.332 --> 28:31.003
Loved it?
They gagged. They gasped. They glowed.

28:32.045 --> 28:34.631
You. Gimble. Come with me.

28:37.092 --> 28:38.260
Okay.

28:40.596 --> 28:44.600
I wasn't sure. But you can't argue
with an ovation like that.

28:44.600 --> 28:46.685
From now on, you change in here.

28:48.103 --> 28:50.731
The body is gone and most of the blood.

28:51.356 --> 28:52.858
Welcome to show business.

28:54.610 --> 28:57.321
Did the police take any other evidence?

28:57.321 --> 29:00.490
What for? They already caught the killer.

28:57.404 --> 29:00.490
What for? They already caught the killer.

29:00.490 --> 29:02.034
Make yourself at home.

29:34.608 --> 29:36.068
You coming back to the party, roomie?

29:36.777 --> 29:37.945
You know it.

29:38.612 --> 29:42.491
Hey, does the address
"17 Quick Street" mean anything to you?

29:43.992 --> 29:45.160
No, why?

29:45.744 --> 29:46.912
No reason.

29:46.912 --> 29:49.456
I would stay away from Quick Street
if I were you, darling.

29:49.456 --> 29:52.251
It's not a safe place
for young fawns like us to slum in.

29:53.210 --> 29:54.670
Not us young fawns.

29:55.462 --> 29:56.880
Come.

29:59.258 --> 30:00.342
Speak of the devil.

30:00.342 --> 30:02.469
Sounds like another wild night
in Schmicago.

30:03.011 --> 30:05.055
Well, at least I know Josh is safe.

30:06.223 --> 30:09.017
<i>When will I see</i>

30:09.017 --> 30:14.815
<i>My doorway to where</i>

30:21.363 --> 30:23.490
<i>Do-do-de-doot
Do-do-de-doot</i>

30:23.991 --> 30:24.992
- Doo-doo
- Doo-doo

30:24.992 --> 30:26.201
<i>Doo</i>

30:26.201 --> 30:27.744
<i>Bustin' out</i>

30:27.744 --> 30:30.289
<i>Buh-buh-buh-buh bustin' out</i>

30:30.289 --> 30:32.708
<i>Buh-baby, it's time to shout</i>

30:32.708 --> 30:36.211
<i>I'm done with these walls around me</i>

30:36.211 --> 30:38.589
<i>Made me think you were my savior</i>

30:38.589 --> 30:41.258
<i>But now I'm out on bad behavior</i>

30:41.258 --> 30:43.343
<i>I'll go any place on Earth</i>

30:43.343 --> 30:45.929
<i>Just to escape your Leavenworth</i>

30:45.929 --> 30:47.764
<i>I'm bustin' out</i>

30:47.764 --> 30:49.850
<i>Buh-buh-buh-buh bustin' out</i>

30:50.350 --> 30:52.728
<i>Buh-baby, it's time to flout</i>

30:52.728 --> 30:56.231
<i>The finger 'round which you wound me</i>

30:56.231 --> 30:58.525
<i>I'm so sick of all your gripes</i>

30:58.525 --> 31:00.986
<i>You know I don't look good in stripes</i>

30:58.609 --> 31:00.986
<i>You know I don't look good in stripes</i>

31:00.986 --> 31:05.824
<i>I'm bustin', bustin' out!</i>

31:05.824 --> 31:08.410
<i>There's no glamour in the slammer
So I'm bustin' out!</i>
