[I blows]

00:45.462 --> 00:47.760
Finn, lunch is ready!

00:48.924 --> 00:50.050
Oh!

00:50.133 --> 00:51.225
What are you cooking?

00:51.301 --> 00:52.473
It's good, man.

00:52.553 --> 00:53.930
I learned it from Rainicorn.

00:54.012 --> 00:55.229
I'm not eating that.

00:55.305 --> 00:56.397
It smells funny.

00:56.473 --> 00:58.100
Dude, this took me, like...

00:58.183 --> 01:00.245
Let's go over to Tree Trunks'
and get some apple pie.

01:00.269 --> 01:01.111
Apple pie!

01:01.186 --> 01:03.655
Apple pie! Apple pie!

01:03.730 --> 01:04.572
Let's go!

01:04.647 --> 01:05.648
Whoa!

01:07.359 --> 01:08.281
Tree Trunks!

01:08.360 --> 01:11.239
Tree Tr...

01:11.321 --> 01:12.698
Tree Trunks!

01:12.781 --> 01:14.203
Tree Trunks?

01:14.283 --> 01:15.500
Apples.

01:15.576 --> 01:17.419
My apples.

01:17.494 --> 01:18.962
Apples?

01:19.037 --> 01:19.833
You!

01:19.913 --> 01:21.085
You took my apples!

01:21.164 --> 01:22.165
Whoa! Whoa!

01:22.249 --> 01:24.172
Tree Trunks, it's us...
Finn and Jake.

01:24.251 --> 01:25.173
Finn?

01:25.252 --> 01:27.129
And... and Jake?

01:27.212 --> 01:28.555
It's okay, Tree Trunks.

01:28.630 --> 01:29.630
We're here to help you.

01:29.673 --> 01:30.799
Just tell us what happened.

01:30.882 --> 01:32.225
They took them.

01:32.301 --> 01:33.348
They took all of them.

01:33.427 --> 01:34.428
All of what?

01:34.511 --> 01:35.728
Apples.

01:35.804 --> 01:38.102
My apples that I
raised with love...

01:38.181 --> 01:40.559
From mere seedlings.

01:40.642 --> 01:45.273
Without my special apples,
I won't be able to bake

01:45.355 --> 01:47.733
any more apple pies.

01:47.816 --> 01:52.242
Noooooo!

01:52.321 --> 01:53.618
Don't you worry, Tree Trunks,

01:53.697 --> 01:56.200
we'll find those thieves
and bring them to justice.

01:56.283 --> 01:59.127
Let me show you the crime scene.

01:59.202 --> 02:02.672
You see, boys, scads
of apple trees but...

02:02.748 --> 02:04.625
But no apples.

02:04.708 --> 02:06.176
Hmm.

02:06.251 --> 02:07.924
Is anything else
missing, Tree Trunks?

02:08.002 --> 02:09.380
No, Finn.

02:09.463 --> 02:13.764
They didn't touch my rocks or
my birds or my flowers or...

02:13.842 --> 02:14.843
Or nothing.

02:14.926 --> 02:15.927
Hmm.

02:16.011 --> 02:18.309
Well, I don't see
any footprints.

02:18.388 --> 02:20.356
What you got, Jake?

02:20.432 --> 02:21.900
No ghost doodies.

02:21.975 --> 02:24.819
Oh. Oh, wait.

02:24.895 --> 02:26.317
Oh, no. No.

02:26.396 --> 02:27.739
Hmm.

02:27.814 --> 02:29.959
Tree Trunks, is there anyone you
can think of who might want to

02:29.983 --> 02:30.983
krunk you up?

02:31.026 --> 02:32.448
Oh, no, Finn.

02:32.527 --> 02:34.529
I take great care
to assure that...

02:34.613 --> 02:37.583
That I'm loved by even
the most heinous...

02:37.658 --> 02:39.331
Hey, guys, I found something!

02:39.409 --> 02:40.409
Look!

02:42.746 --> 02:44.544
Oh, hey. Hey, Finn.

02:45.540 --> 02:46.792
Oh, hey, Raggedy Princess.

02:46.875 --> 02:48.502
Have you seen anything
fishy going on?

02:48.585 --> 02:50.679
Um, no.

02:50.754 --> 02:52.674
I've been kind of down
this hole for a long time.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.485
I got knocked down here
by some Ne'er-do-wells.

02:55.509 --> 02:56.726
It was terrible.

02:56.802 --> 02:57.803
I was so scared.

02:57.886 --> 02:58.933
Ne'er-do-wells?

02:59.012 --> 03:00.514
They stole my apples.

03:00.597 --> 03:04.397
I'm gonna sass those
boys up nasty!

03:05.435 --> 03:06.357
Awesome.

03:06.436 --> 03:07.653
Where do we find these guys?

03:07.729 --> 03:09.731
Oh, the Candy Tavern, man.

03:09.815 --> 03:12.034
I used to hang out there back
when I used to snatch old

03:12.109 --> 03:13.235
ladies' purses.

03:15.028 --> 03:15.950
Don't worry.

03:16.029 --> 03:17.656
I stopped doing that
a long time ago.

03:17.739 --> 03:18.911
I didn't know it was wrong.

03:20.325 --> 03:22.874
Okay, you two, let's get going.

03:25.747 --> 03:26.747
Uhh!

03:27.541 --> 03:29.464
Oh, my!

03:38.051 --> 03:40.725
Uh, does Princess Bubblegum
know about this place?

03:40.804 --> 03:41.804
Be cool, man.

03:41.847 --> 03:43.064
You're gonna queer the deal.

03:43.140 --> 03:45.734
Oh, yeah. Try not to act
suspicious, Tree Trunks.

03:45.809 --> 03:47.982
Okay, I won't.

03:51.356 --> 03:52.198
Where...

03:52.274 --> 03:53.742
Oh!

03:53.817 --> 03:56.036
Where's my dang apples?

03:57.362 --> 03:58.955
Tree Trunks, you're so silly.

03:59.030 --> 04:00.247
But... but listen.

04:00.323 --> 04:01.592
You wouldn't happen
to have seen any...

04:01.616 --> 04:02.742
I don't know...

04:02.826 --> 04:04.544
Apples around, have you?

04:04.619 --> 04:07.589
Seen any apples?

04:07.664 --> 04:11.259
You ask a lot of
dumb-butt questions,

04:11.334 --> 04:13.587
almost like you're trying
to solve something.

04:13.670 --> 04:14.592
What?

04:14.671 --> 04:15.718
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no.

04:15.797 --> 04:18.596
Mm. Clean, too.

04:18.675 --> 04:20.848
Almost like some do-gooders!

04:20.927 --> 04:21.769
Hold on.

04:21.845 --> 04:23.347
We got to go potty.

04:28.518 --> 04:29.519
Dang.

04:29.603 --> 04:30.695
They almost got us.

04:30.771 --> 04:32.694
But I think we blend
in pretty well now.

04:32.773 --> 04:36.027
This... This toilet
paper's drying my...

04:36.109 --> 04:38.157
My mouth all up.

04:38.236 --> 04:40.364
Tree Trunks, don't eat that.

04:40.447 --> 04:41.289
Here.

04:41.364 --> 04:43.366
You got to watch your man.

04:43.450 --> 04:47.455
Oh, I look just
like an army brat.

04:52.334 --> 04:54.007
What can I do for you?

04:54.085 --> 04:57.635
You know where a guy might
maybe score some apples?

04:58.715 --> 05:00.012
Well, when you put it like that,

05:00.091 --> 05:02.844
a couple of buddies I know
have some apples for sale.

05:02.928 --> 05:04.851
I'll show you.

05:06.306 --> 05:12.439
Hey, fellas, these folks been
asking about your ...apples.

05:12.521 --> 05:13.443
Okay-

05:13.522 --> 05:14.944
Show 'em the apples, Smudge.

05:15.023 --> 05:17.651
Grab 'em!

05:17.734 --> 05:20.863
You go back, and you
tell your boss to stop

05:20.946 --> 05:24.371
looking for those apples,
'cause they're ours now!

05:24.449 --> 05:25.996
W-what boss?

05:26.076 --> 05:28.545
Your boss... Dr. J.

05:28.620 --> 05:29.963
We don't know any Dr. J.

05:30.038 --> 05:31.085
Liar!

05:31.164 --> 05:31.960
Ouch!

05:32.040 --> 05:33.383
Come on, Smudge.

05:33.458 --> 05:36.052
Dr. J. Gonna take myapples.

05:38.755 --> 05:40.052
What just happened?

05:40.131 --> 05:42.759
I guess these guys who stole
Tree Trunks' apples also

05:42.843 --> 05:46.347
stole Dr. J.'s apples, and they
thought we were working for him.

05:46.429 --> 05:47.931
Finn, Finn.

05:48.014 --> 05:48.856
Hmm?

05:48.932 --> 05:50.400
This could be dangerous.

05:50.475 --> 05:54.230
And if you want to go
back home, I understand.

05:54.312 --> 05:56.815
But I need to do this.

05:56.898 --> 05:58.445
Yeah, Tree Trunks. Me too.

05:58.525 --> 05:59.401
Hey, Finn.

05:59.484 --> 06:00.360
Hmm?

06:00.443 --> 06:01.911
What's that on your face, buddy?

06:01.987 --> 06:03.580
Oh, the guy bopped me one.

06:03.655 --> 06:05.077
Must have had a ring on.

06:05.156 --> 06:10.003
You know, I think I seen that
symbol somewhere before.

06:10.078 --> 06:11.330
Yeah.

06:11.413 --> 06:14.383
Right next door to where I
used to hock stolen bikes.

06:14.457 --> 06:15.333
What?!

06:15.417 --> 06:16.919
I didn't know it was wrong.

06:18.628 --> 06:21.723
Yeah, you see, that guy must
work here or something.

06:26.970 --> 06:29.223
Hello?

06:29.306 --> 06:32.025
Who's the heck happening?

06:32.100 --> 06:33.101
What?

06:33.184 --> 06:35.403
Uh, we're here about the apples.

06:35.478 --> 06:37.651
Oh. Okay.

06:37.731 --> 06:39.699
Let's see your ring.

06:39.774 --> 06:40.946
Um...

06:41.026 --> 06:42.494
here.

06:44.613 --> 06:45.614
Come on in.

06:45.697 --> 06:47.165
Follow this guy.

06:51.828 --> 06:53.876
My boss is gonna be real psyched

06:53.955 --> 06:56.959
I found someone to
buy his apples.

06:58.627 --> 07:00.300
A whole crate.

07:02.130 --> 07:04.758
What the... what's wrong, guy?

07:04.841 --> 07:06.138
These aren't apples.

07:06.217 --> 07:09.391
Oh, it didn't mean "diamonds"?

07:09.471 --> 07:13.317
All Ne'er-do-wells call
diamonds "apples,"

07:13.391 --> 07:20.195
like calling money "Bread" or
rock-knockers "Butterslaps."

07:20.273 --> 07:22.241
Hey, Wormo, we're back.

07:22.317 --> 07:24.490
What the... What are
theydoing here?

07:24.569 --> 07:26.663
They're here for the apples.

07:26.738 --> 07:29.582
That's the dang Dr.
J. Gang, Wormo.

07:29.658 --> 07:30.705
Grab them!

07:32.410 --> 07:34.879
Um, Sir

07:34.955 --> 07:36.502
I promise if you let us go,

07:36.581 --> 07:40.256
we won't tell no one
about your apples.

07:40.335 --> 07:42.133
Feed 'em to the pig.

07:42.212 --> 07:43.885
Yeah, the pig.

07:44.881 --> 07:46.303
Yeah. All right.

07:49.302 --> 07:50.645
I'm sorry, y'all.

07:50.720 --> 07:52.267
They're making me do this.

07:52.347 --> 07:54.566
I'll... I'll try
to make it quick.

07:54.641 --> 07:55.563
Hold it!

07:55.642 --> 07:57.064
Dr. J.!

07:57.143 --> 07:59.020
Yeah, yeah, and I
want my apples back.

07:59.104 --> 08:00.230
Get 'em, boys.

08:11.324 --> 08:14.419
[I Crying softly]

08:14.494 --> 08:17.498
Ah, don't cry, Tree Trunks.

08:17.580 --> 08:21.676
But we're never gonna
find those apples.

08:21.751 --> 08:22.673
Apples?

08:22.752 --> 08:23.872
You guys looking for apples?

08:23.920 --> 08:25.263
Uh, yeah. Why?

08:25.338 --> 08:28.387
'Cause I can hear a bunch
of apples in this room.

08:28.466 --> 08:30.468
You mean apples as diamonds?

08:30.552 --> 08:31.553
Nope.

08:31.636 --> 08:32.683
Apples as apples?

08:32.761 --> 08:33.683
Yep.

08:33.763 --> 08:35.140
You mean apples that we eat?

08:35.222 --> 08:36.270
Yes.

08:36.349 --> 08:39.693
With all due respect, Mr.
Pig, Sir,

08:39.769 --> 08:42.443
my apples were
stolen by a dirty,

08:42.522 --> 08:45.867
rotten criminal who needs
to be put in jail!

08:45.942 --> 08:48.036
I'm just telling you
the facts, ma'am.

08:48.111 --> 08:51.991
What I hear is a whole pig-load
of apples inside that closet.

08:52.073 --> 08:54.622
They sound scared.

08:54.701 --> 08:57.079
Well, I hate to tell
you this, boys,

08:57.162 --> 09:00.837
but there's no apples
in this closet.

09:00.915 --> 09:05.512
You see, uh, I'm the only
one who knows how to open

09:05.587 --> 09:07.089
this closet.

09:08.840 --> 09:10.012
Oh!

09:10.091 --> 09:13.220
So I was the apple
thief, after all.

09:13.303 --> 09:14.680
No, Tree Trunks.

09:14.763 --> 09:16.060
That's preposterous.

09:16.139 --> 09:17.311
No, Finn.

09:17.390 --> 09:20.860
I'm a criminal, and I
need to pay the price.

09:23.021 --> 09:24.443
Banana guard speaking.

09:24.522 --> 09:26.240
Uh, this is Tree Trunks.

09:26.316 --> 09:28.535
I've done something horrible,

09:28.610 --> 09:31.784
and I want you to come
over and arrest me.

09:35.617 --> 09:38.291
Tree Trunks, you don't
need to do this.

09:38.369 --> 09:42.215
Thank you, Finn and Jake, but
I won't let myself slip away

09:42.290 --> 09:45.544
from such a terrible crime.

09:45.627 --> 09:47.174
Goodbye.

09:47.253 --> 09:48.550
Tree Trunks...

09:48.630 --> 09:50.632
Uh, this is hard to watch.

09:50.715 --> 09:52.092
I'm gonna look away.

09:53.301 --> 09:55.019
This place could
use a scarecrow.

09:55.095 --> 09:55.937
Huh?

09:56.012 --> 09:57.355
Wait. What'd you say?

09:57.430 --> 10:00.229
I said, "This place
could use a scarecrow."

10:00.308 --> 10:01.685
A scarecrow...

10:01.768 --> 10:03.065
no footprints...

10:03.144 --> 10:05.192
All those magpies on the roof...

10:05.271 --> 10:07.490
Raggedy Princess in the ditch...

10:07.565 --> 10:10.239
And all the apples in
Tree Trunks' closet.

10:10.318 --> 10:13.288
Boy, this place could
use a scarecrow.

10:13.363 --> 10:15.707
That's it!

10:15.782 --> 10:16.782
I knew it!

10:18.993 --> 10:21.667
The magpies have been stealing
the apples and accidentally

10:21.746 --> 10:23.214
dropping them in this hole.

10:23.289 --> 10:25.434
And that's why there weren't any
footprints around the tree.

10:25.458 --> 10:26.675
Yes!

10:26.751 --> 10:29.049
And the magpies were able
to steal the apples because

10:29.129 --> 10:31.023
Raggedy Princess wasn't
sitting on the fence post

10:31.047 --> 10:32.264
to scare them off.

10:32.340 --> 10:35.685
Does this mean I'm innocent?

10:35.760 --> 10:38.104
As innocent as a
baby's butt cheek.

10:38.179 --> 10:39.431
Awesome.

10:39.514 --> 10:41.562
This calls for a celebration.

10:41.641 --> 10:44.110
You know what that
means, Tree Trunks.

10:44.185 --> 10:50.158
I'm-a bake you the biggest and
the tastiest apple pie you

10:50.233 --> 10:52.361
boys ever tasted.

10:54.821 --> 10:56.118
Whoa!

10:56.197 --> 11:00.043
Uh, you boys better stick
around if you want to bite

11:00.118 --> 11:01.745
of my apple pie.

11:01.828 --> 11:03.751
She slapped my butt.
