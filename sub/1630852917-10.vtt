00:09.643 --> 00:11.213
(music)

00:11.311 --> 00:12.981
CHRIS: I think I see
caribou up there.

00:14.314 --> 00:15.484
Let’s see if we get
up there.

00:23.590 --> 00:24.560
Stay low.

00:32.132 --> 00:33.202
JESSI: Here we go.

00:35.102 --> 00:37.372
You can see at least
hundred caribou over here.
They’re all running.

00:41.241 --> 00:43.511
Don’t shoot it.
That’s way too far.
CHRIS: No.

00:43.610 --> 00:45.250
JESSI: How far do you
think those guys are?

00:45.345 --> 00:48.105
CHRIS: About two-hundred
yards. Maybe a little
bit more.

00:48.215 --> 00:50.185
JESSI: That’s
really (bleep) far.

00:50.284 --> 00:52.494
I want my kills to be
ethical. I want ’em
to be clean.

00:52.586 --> 00:54.146
I want ’em to be quick.

00:55.722 --> 00:56.822
CHRIS: They’re
coming up towards us.

00:56.924 --> 00:58.564
They’re real spookish
this time of year.

01:00.460 --> 01:03.100
Come on, Jess. You gotta
shoot that animal.

01:03.196 --> 01:04.456
JESSI: I don’t have it.

01:04.565 --> 01:06.675
CHRIS: Push it. Right now.

01:08.468 --> 01:09.498
Shoot it.

01:12.005 --> 01:13.005
JESSI: I can’t.

01:14.641 --> 01:16.641
Chris, I’m not comfortable
taking the shot.

01:16.743 --> 01:18.713
I’m not gonna take the
shot, and you telling
me to take the shot

01:18.812 --> 01:19.952
is not gonna make me
more comfortable.

01:21.748 --> 01:26.218
I’ve always had Chris to rely
on, but out here you’ve gotta
be able to feed yourself.

01:32.459 --> 01:35.199
This means a lot more
than just going out a
bringing home a caribou

01:35.295 --> 01:38.995
for the winter, it’s
knowing that I can do
it by myself.

01:39.099 --> 01:41.769
I need to be a better
hunter. Yeah.

01:41.868 --> 01:43.768
I can’t find a good spot.

01:45.973 --> 01:48.813
I’ve never taken a
shot that I had that
I wasn’t for sure on.

01:48.909 --> 01:50.809
The thing is, I
just wasn’t ready.

01:50.911 --> 01:54.381
I’m just, it’s real fast.
You gotta get your,

01:54.481 --> 01:57.751
you gotta take your shot but
the worst thing in my mind

01:57.851 --> 02:01.921
is to wound an animal
and then lose it. So,
I have to be sure.

02:02.022 --> 02:02.862
CHRIS: Here they come.

02:04.124 --> 02:04.964
You see ’em?
JESSI: Yeah.

02:05.058 --> 02:06.328
CHRIS: Let’s go.

02:32.586 --> 02:33.746
JESSI: I can’t go that far.

02:35.455 --> 02:36.485
I can’t.

02:37.457 --> 02:38.857
I’m not gonna make it.
CHRIS: No, it’s too far now.

02:42.162 --> 02:47.032
JESSI: They, I can never
take a shot unless I’m sure.

02:47.134 --> 02:48.944
Oh! Jeez.

02:52.005 --> 02:54.135
I just don’t want an
animal to be in pain.

02:58.378 --> 03:02.048
JOHNNY: You know
living out here, we’re
focused on surviving.

03:02.149 --> 03:06.519
You gotta keep your senses
active, because of how fast
things do change out here

03:08.055 --> 03:10.265
and how surprising it
can become.

03:14.661 --> 03:15.431
Where’d he go?

03:17.431 --> 03:19.071
(multiple shots)

03:21.935 --> 03:22.795
Where’d he go?

03:25.138 --> 03:26.268
Where you at, dude?

03:29.876 --> 03:30.676
Oh, I see him. I see him.

03:32.045 --> 03:35.315
(multiple shots)

03:39.186 --> 03:41.386
(bleep) this, man.

03:41.488 --> 03:43.058
This guy can jump.

03:44.524 --> 03:47.564
He had a mouth just
full of caribou hair.

03:47.661 --> 03:50.961
Yeah, I put a lot of
time and effort in
hunting these caribou

03:51.064 --> 03:53.004
and taking care of the hides.

03:53.100 --> 03:57.770
You know, I come out
there and hides are
all chewed up and,

03:57.871 --> 03:59.441
and I can’t have
that out here.

04:02.576 --> 04:03.976
Holy (bleep)!

04:06.079 --> 04:08.719
There he goes.
There he goes.

04:10.283 --> 04:12.323
There’s just too many
sticks in the way
every time I shoot.

04:13.820 --> 04:16.260
It’s hard to let this guy
go but I think I have to.

04:18.058 --> 04:19.428
You win this round, buddy.

04:21.061 --> 04:22.101
Man.

04:24.264 --> 04:28.534
Squirrel might have got some
of my hide, but he kinda
kick-started my brain into

04:28.635 --> 04:31.295
realizing that
winter’s here.

04:32.372 --> 04:35.012
I’m gonna take that
squirrel’s advice and
make sure I’m ready

04:35.108 --> 04:36.978
and prepared for
this winter.

04:37.077 --> 04:39.947
Make sure I’m ready to burn
cords of wood this winter.

04:41.414 --> 04:43.984
So, I gotta climb up
here and do chimney

04:44.084 --> 04:47.424
and roof maintenance
all winter long.

04:47.521 --> 04:49.191
Make sure I’m gonna
be warm this winter.

04:54.294 --> 05:01.134
You gotta make sure the
stove is clean, it’s clear,
and it’s ready to burn.

05:02.302 --> 05:08.212
There’s a lot of
creosote in here, and
that’s all flammable.

05:08.308 --> 05:11.638
That stuff will burn and
cause a chimney fire.

05:11.745 --> 05:17.825
So, if the top of this stove
pipe, and this rain cap are
covered in creosote,

05:17.918 --> 05:22.988
that means all the way down
to the stove is probably
covered with creosote.

05:25.358 --> 05:26.588
So, we’ll check out
this stove.

05:31.298 --> 05:33.668
So, it’s stove cleaning time.

05:33.767 --> 05:38.937
Yeah, you look at this
door right here, there’s
just chips of creosote,

05:39.039 --> 05:42.209
and this stuff is
flammable, you know.
It burns pretty easily.

05:46.012 --> 05:47.252
Take this lantern and

05:50.050 --> 05:51.650
look how quick that
catches on fire.

05:53.553 --> 05:55.893
That’s creosote right
there, and that just shows
you how dangerous it is.

05:58.959 --> 06:04.029
If it catches on fire,
then this box can get
really, really hot.

06:04.130 --> 06:09.900
This pipe here is full
of creosote, and all
this will get red hot,

06:10.003 --> 06:14.613
and it travels all the way
up, and you’re looking at a
short gap between this pipe

06:14.708 --> 06:18.478
and this wood here. You
know, if it gets how enough,

06:18.578 --> 06:21.378
catches on fire and
this cabin burns down.

06:21.481 --> 06:23.481
And I just can’t afford
to have that happen.

06:23.583 --> 06:24.983
We’ve got work to do still.

06:28.388 --> 06:31.258
ALEX: Right now’s a good
time of year to take
care of camp chores.

06:31.358 --> 06:34.128
Take care of my equipment.
Safe guarding my food,

06:34.227 --> 06:37.397
my animals, just things
that I have to do.
Because if I don’t then,

06:37.497 --> 06:38.767
well you know, I’ll die.

06:41.534 --> 06:47.644
ALEX: Okay, so the agenda
for today is to really take
good care of my firewood

06:47.741 --> 06:50.941
because this is what’s
going to keep me alive
through the winter.

06:52.245 --> 06:55.175
So I cut down living
birch trees and of course

06:55.282 --> 06:57.152
when I cut one down
they’re full of water.

06:57.250 --> 07:01.120
They won’t burn and
once I split them and
I stack them up here,

07:01.221 --> 07:04.961
then they sit there all
summer long and the water
evaporates out of them.

07:06.126 --> 07:10.526
And then of course just
having a tarp on it like
this isn’t, you know,

07:10.630 --> 07:14.800
the best way to get air
flow for it to dry out
to its maximum potential.

07:14.901 --> 07:19.311
But with a woodshed over
top of it to get maximum
air flow and sunlight on it,

07:19.406 --> 07:23.236
then I think I can have
great firewood next year
rather than just getting by.

07:23.343 --> 07:26.113
So the way I’m going to
build the woodshed is
by building a roof

07:26.212 --> 07:28.212
that will block
rain and snow.

07:28.315 --> 07:31.355
So right off the bat I’ve
already, you know, kinda
run into one problem.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.121
This is one of these things
that’s hard to plan for.

07:33.219 --> 07:35.559
These nails I got
are pretty long.

07:35.655 --> 07:38.285
But they’re just not quite
long enough to get through
the fat end of the log.

07:38.391 --> 07:42.091
What I’ll do is cut
a notch into the wood to
make it a little thinner.

07:42.195 --> 07:47.365
That way that nail will go
all the way through and get
a good bite into the tree.

07:47.467 --> 07:50.397
Oh yeah, that’s good.

07:50.503 --> 07:52.213
Great, now that
feels super solid.

07:58.244 --> 08:00.654
Let’s just see what
that feels like.

08:00.747 --> 08:02.277
Yeah, that’s pretty good.

08:02.382 --> 08:05.322
I mean yeah if this can
hold me I think it’ll be
able to hold the snow load.

08:08.955 --> 08:12.525
Better firewood is going to
have a big impact on the
quality of the firewood

08:12.625 --> 08:15.255
I’m burning and give me
a much better quality
of life.

08:15.362 --> 08:19.432
Pretty nice and tight,
the tarp will make up
the difference.

08:19.532 --> 08:22.542
I’m going to stay warmer,
I’m going to heat up my
food and water quicker.

08:22.635 --> 08:24.995
It’s a little bit of
effort but a big reward.

08:25.105 --> 08:29.285
Now I’ll go get the
piles down there and
move all of it up here.

08:34.914 --> 08:37.624
You know, I’ve been doing
this long enough I guess
when I have to do

08:37.717 --> 08:40.587
a big mountain of work
I just kinda zone out
and just do it.

08:40.687 --> 08:43.557
Just go at a slow
pace, low gear, just
go until it’s done.

08:46.860 --> 08:49.700
Now that I know I’m
going to have top quality
firewood next winter,

08:49.796 --> 08:53.026
the next thing I want
to focus on is trying
to catch fish.

08:58.438 --> 09:01.868
RJ: Alaska’s a great
place to come out and
work your ass off.

09:01.975 --> 09:05.555
It’s a part of who we are
and what we do as Alaskans.

09:08.314 --> 09:11.584
Remember when we came out
here and there was deer all
over out on these beaches?

09:11.684 --> 09:13.654
Should probably try to
get one or two if we can.

09:13.753 --> 09:15.093
We’re running low on meat.

09:15.188 --> 09:18.018
ROBERT: Today we need
to get anything that
provides more meat.

09:18.124 --> 09:21.464
RJ: we’re gonna go out,
we’re gonna see if we can
find some deer on the beach.

09:21.561 --> 09:23.731
We need to put some more
meat in the freezer.

09:29.502 --> 09:30.302
Deer on the beach.

09:33.773 --> 09:35.943
Just drop me off on
the side right here.

09:36.042 --> 09:37.742
ROBERT: Yeah, I’ll just
drop you off right on

coming down so they’re
just getting further,

JOHNNY: Living in Alaska
is about survival.

13:56.636 --> 14:01.136
I’ve learned to accept
the darkness, the
cold, the isolation.

14:01.808 --> 14:05.108
But it’s part of living
out here, and it allows
me the space that I crave.

14:07.013 --> 14:11.083
All right, time to
separate these puppies.

14:11.184 --> 14:14.094
Got get all this creosote
out of here because
this stuff is flammable.

14:18.224 --> 14:23.164
So, it’s just a good time to
kinda maintain everything
around the stove.

14:23.262 --> 14:28.402
I prefer to go get food,
but right now we got
early snow.

14:28.501 --> 14:31.601
I don’t really have a choice
but to get the job done.

14:31.704 --> 14:32.744
This is the heart of
the cabin.

14:34.207 --> 14:35.137
This is where I cook.

14:37.243 --> 14:39.613
This is where I boil water.

14:39.712 --> 14:42.882
And this is what keeps me
warm throughout these
cold winters.

14:45.151 --> 14:47.521
Bones in here,
all kinds of junk.

14:48.721 --> 14:51.091
This thing needs
a deep clean, man.

14:52.191 --> 14:55.931
You know people’s
modern ovens have a
deep clean setting

14:56.028 --> 14:57.198
where you push a button,

14:59.532 --> 15:03.942
let it clean, and
you just walk away,

15:04.036 --> 15:06.406
and this is kind of my
version of that.

15:07.874 --> 15:13.914
Gonna start a big old
raging fire and just
let it clean itself.

15:14.013 --> 15:15.483
It’s blazing pretty good.

15:18.918 --> 15:23.088
Little light taps just
knocking off the creosote
on the ceiling.

15:23.189 --> 15:24.319
It’s just kinda
knocking it down.

15:28.761 --> 15:32.001
You live in the bush, you
gotta take care of the
equipment that you have

15:32.098 --> 15:33.668
because you rely on it.

15:36.035 --> 15:39.535
Fire’s hitting all that
creosote, shows you how
fast it all comes out.

15:43.276 --> 15:44.906
That’s a clean pipe, man.

15:46.946 --> 15:50.616
Learned the quickest
way to cool this down,
ice cold water.

15:54.554 --> 15:57.264
It’s looking pretty
clean in there.

15:57.356 --> 15:58.856
We got a lot of ash in here.

16:01.194 --> 16:04.934
Sun’s going down, and
it’s gonna start
dropping in temperature

16:05.031 --> 16:08.131
so it’s a good time to
have a nice stove inside
the cabin.

16:13.873 --> 16:15.113
Oh boy.

16:17.343 --> 16:21.053
I can see some light
coming in on some of
these cracks to the logs.

16:21.147 --> 16:25.117
When I built this cabin, I
tried to get some of those
logs as tight as possible,

16:25.218 --> 16:30.258
but what I couldn’t get
’em perfect, I have to
fill the gaps with moss.

16:30.356 --> 16:33.256
And moss is very insulating,
it’s got awesome insulating
properties,

16:35.728 --> 16:39.058
but squirrels and birds
come and they pick it
for their nest,

16:39.165 --> 16:41.735
and right now, the
ground’s frozen,

16:41.834 --> 16:47.314
so it’s not a good time to
go out and get moss, but I
don’t really have a choice.

16:51.611 --> 16:53.851
ALEX: Living on my own,
you know, I have to
wear many hats.

16:53.946 --> 16:55.806
I have to do many jobs.

16:55.915 --> 16:59.725
But uh, the most
important job I do is
uh, getting the food.

17:05.157 --> 17:06.457
Today’s fishing day.

17:06.559 --> 17:08.859
Be getting more and
more ice any day when
there’s not wind.

17:08.961 --> 17:10.501
This ice is growing.

17:10.596 --> 17:12.096
It’s not too thick yet.

17:12.198 --> 17:15.668
It may just be a few
more days I’m able to get
on the water like this.

17:15.768 --> 17:17.468
Of course you never know
what the weather’s gonna do,

17:17.570 --> 17:19.170
but I have to
assume the worst.

17:19.272 --> 17:21.442
The winter is approaching,
and I’m trying to prepare.

17:21.541 --> 17:23.981
Pretty soon the lake
will be turned to ice,

17:24.076 --> 17:27.006
so there’s gonna be a
period where I can’t
fish from my boat,

17:27.113 --> 17:28.313
and I can’t ice fish.

17:29.482 --> 17:32.052
But, if I can get through the
ice, then I need to because I
gotta get the meat.

17:32.151 --> 17:35.051
I have to make excuses to
win. You know, I can’t
make excuses to fail.

17:40.359 --> 17:43.329
Okay, that’s set up.

17:43.429 --> 17:44.959
Let me just uh.

17:54.273 --> 17:58.683
Yeah, and since I’m
out here in the lake,
on a boat,

17:58.778 --> 18:00.948
I don’t really need to
cast too much.

18:01.047 --> 18:06.247
I’ll just kind of uh
similar to ice fishing, I’ll
just let it go down a ways.

18:06.352 --> 18:07.892
Oh, yeah there’s a fish.
I can see him.

18:11.991 --> 18:13.561
Oh, on the boat I can
feel his strength.

18:17.797 --> 18:19.127
Boy, he’s strong.

18:21.834 --> 18:22.974
That’s a big pike.

18:26.072 --> 18:28.012
Yeah, there’s one.

18:29.342 --> 18:30.882
See if we can get any more.

18:36.449 --> 18:38.019
What the hell?
There’s a little,

18:38.117 --> 18:40.347
something white just darted
out and went in the water.

18:43.255 --> 18:44.385
What the hell?

18:54.100 --> 18:55.700
That’s a strange sight.

18:57.103 --> 19:00.743
Looks like a rabbit.
That’s weird.

19:00.840 --> 19:01.910
That’s really weird.

19:05.044 --> 19:09.284
Look at that. There’s almost
no chance of, you know,
getting a rabbit that way.

19:09.382 --> 19:11.952
It’s ridiculous but
anything can happen.

19:12.051 --> 19:15.021
I mean that’s really what
this lifestyle’s all about.

19:15.121 --> 19:16.661
Um, I mean just a
moment ago it was alive.

19:16.756 --> 19:20.456
It must have hit
the water, froze, went
into shock and drowned.

19:20.559 --> 19:21.959
But look, I mean it’s
dead dead.

19:22.061 --> 19:26.271
Whatever was chasing this
might be way in there in
the woods or something

19:26.365 --> 19:30.765
and this rabbit thought he
was home free and went on
the ice and then just.

19:30.870 --> 19:32.170
That’s the craziest thing.

19:37.410 --> 19:40.980
JESSI: Coming out here,
and going hunting, it’s
a lifestyle for us.

19:41.080 --> 19:42.310
It’s not just a
weekend getaway.

19:44.250 --> 19:46.550
There’s a lot that comes
with taking a life.

19:49.522 --> 19:52.692
I feel like those caribou
we saw disappeared into
these trees.

19:52.792 --> 19:54.332
They’re sitting a
hundred and fifty yards

19:54.427 --> 19:56.927
in front of us over the
face of this cliff.

19:58.831 --> 20:01.971
So, we’re gonna
proceed with caution.

20:02.968 --> 20:05.738
Twice now, I didn’t
take the shot.

20:05.838 --> 20:08.338
’Cause I wasn’t
confident enough.

20:08.441 --> 20:10.211
But I still have a chance.

20:10.309 --> 20:12.479
Caribou could be right
around the corner.

20:14.480 --> 20:18.620
CHRIS: Right over here,
they’re coming up the hill.

20:18.718 --> 20:21.688
JESSI: So, we’re
gonna stay really low.

20:21.787 --> 20:24.187
We’re gonna stay
really quiet.

20:29.361 --> 20:30.761
Do you think I can
shoot that?

20:30.863 --> 20:32.033
CHRIS: Yeah.

20:38.804 --> 20:40.374
JESSI: As soon as I
get ready, they move.

20:41.874 --> 20:43.844
CHRIS: Just focus on you.

20:50.883 --> 20:51.783
(rifle shot)

20:54.720 --> 20:57.120
That was a really far shot.

20:57.223 --> 21:01.463
JESSI: She didn’t
move whatsoever.

21:01.560 --> 21:02.890
I think that we
gotta go down there.

21:02.995 --> 21:05.225
I think that we gotta go
see if this is a blood
trail or not, Chris.

21:05.331 --> 21:07.101
CHRIS: Okay.
JESSI: (bleep)

21:07.199 --> 21:08.229
All right, we’re
gonna go down there.

21:20.946 --> 21:24.876
CHRIS: Look. There’s a bunch
of feces with blood mixed.

21:24.984 --> 21:28.854
JESSI: Oh (bleep).
CHRIS: You got a lung-shot.

21:28.954 --> 21:30.494
This is bleeding heavy.

21:30.589 --> 21:32.089
JESSI: Follow this
around and see.
CHRIS: Yeah.

21:45.237 --> 21:47.437
JESSI: Oh God, it’s
right there.

21:47.540 --> 21:49.470
She’s fifty-five
feet in front of me.

21:57.116 --> 22:00.386
CHRIS: I think.
JESSI: Just wait.

22:00.486 --> 22:02.686
I already screwed up.
We can be slow.

22:11.797 --> 22:14.797
Do you think I can shoulder
this or do you think
I have to be on the bipod?

22:14.900 --> 22:17.640
CHRIS: Take my back
and use it as a bipod.

22:20.873 --> 22:24.643
JESSI: That’s the one I shot.
He’s bleeding really bad.

22:27.880 --> 22:29.480
(bleep).

22:29.582 --> 22:31.082
I’m so sorry, caribou.

22:36.222 --> 22:39.322
Three, two.

22:39.325 --> 22:46.131
Okay, snacks and popcorn
are gonna be expensive.

22:46.131 --> 22:47.331
Let’s just accept that.

22:47.333 --> 22:48.833
Going to the movies
can be a lot

22:48.834 --> 22:50.603
for young homeowners
turning into their parents.

22:50.603 --> 22:52.471
Bathrooms -- even if you don’t
have to go, you should try.

22:52.471 --> 22:55.371
We all know where the bathroom
is and how to us it, okay?

22:55.374 --> 22:57.376
You know, the Stevensons
told me they saved money

22:57.376 --> 22:59.406
bundling their boat insurance
with Progressive.

22:59.411 --> 23:01.280
No one knows
who those people are.

23:01.280 --> 23:03.080
-It can be painful.
-Hand me your coats.

23:03.082 --> 23:04.650
There’s an extra seat
right here.

23:04.650 --> 23:07.150
No, no, no, no, no.
We don’t need a coat wrangler.

23:07.152 --> 23:08.988
Progressive can’t save you
from becoming your parents,

23:08.988 --> 23:10.556
but we can save you money

23:10.556 --> 23:11.916
when you bundle home, auto,
and more with us.

23:11.924 --> 23:13.492
No one who made
the movie is here.

23:13.492 --> 23:46.592
Stuff. We love stuff.

23:46.592 --> 23:49.092
And there‘s some really
great stuff out there.

23:49.094 --> 23:50.462
But I doubt that any of us

23:50.462 --> 23:51.997
will look back on
our lives and think,

23:51.997 --> 23:55.427
"I wish I’d bought
an even thinner TV,

23:55.434 --> 23:57.903
found a lighter light beer,

23:57.903 --> 24:00.773
or had an even smarter
smartphone."

24:00.773 --> 24:02.673
Do you think any of us
will look back on our lives

24:02.675 --> 24:04.715
and regret the things
we didn‘t buy?

24:07.947 --> 24:09.677
Or the places we didn‘t go?

24:09.682 --> 24:11.650
♪ I’d go the whole wide world ♪

24:11.650 --> 24:13.690
♪ I’d go the whole wide world ♪

25:59.491 --> 26:01.561
(rifle shot)

26:04.963 --> 26:07.203
JESSI: Thank God. Chris,
the caribou just fell down.

26:11.637 --> 26:13.097
So, I’m just gonna
take it slow.

26:13.205 --> 26:16.075
I’m gonna walk from
here straight that way.

26:16.175 --> 26:18.415
CHRIS: Yeah, see
that, the left tree?

26:18.510 --> 26:20.880
JESSI: Okay, I’m
headed down.

26:23.882 --> 26:29.222
JESSI: Yeah.
CHRIS: This is really her
first time all by herself.

26:29.321 --> 26:32.021
She’s always had her dad
or me as her hunting buddy.

26:35.561 --> 26:38.301
It’s really important
that she does everything
by herself today.

26:38.397 --> 26:39.797
Build that confidence.

26:41.967 --> 26:42.627
There it is.

26:46.738 --> 26:47.908
Come on, Jess.

26:49.708 --> 26:51.138
She knows what she’s doing.

26:55.147 --> 26:57.077
You got it, Jess.
It’s perfect.

26:59.952 --> 27:01.152
Come on, baby.

27:06.592 --> 27:07.662
There it is.

27:07.759 --> 27:09.189
She dropped it.

27:09.828 --> 27:11.258
Right up in the shoulder.

27:13.532 --> 27:15.072
Now it’s not getting away.

27:15.167 --> 27:17.837
So, I’m gonna take all
of our gear and I’m gonna
start catching up with her.

27:20.639 --> 27:24.409
JESSI: That was it.
Caribou’s down. That
was a direct hit.

27:26.678 --> 27:28.548
God, please bless
this animal.

27:34.386 --> 27:38.886
CHRIS: Good job. Oh!
JESSI: Hey.

27:38.991 --> 27:41.291
CHRIS: Thank you for
your life, caribou.

27:41.393 --> 27:44.003
JESSI: We’re so
grateful for you.
CHRIS: Go easy, if you can.

27:44.096 --> 27:45.496
JESSI: Bless us and
forgive us.

27:45.597 --> 27:47.097
CHRIS: Good job.
JESSI: We did it.

27:47.199 --> 27:49.399
CHRIS: I’m proud of you.

27:49.501 --> 27:51.801
JESSI: Now we have
a lot of work to do.
CHRIS: Yeah.

27:51.904 --> 27:54.344
We’ll get him gutted out
and then I can just toss
him on one of these sleds

27:54.439 --> 27:55.539
and we can get him
down onto flat ground,

27:55.641 --> 27:56.571
a little easier to
work with.

27:57.976 --> 27:59.836
It’s gonna be one of those
after-dark days, I think.

28:05.417 --> 28:07.347
ROBERT: Good girl.

28:07.452 --> 28:08.952
Patience is a virtue.

28:09.054 --> 28:11.164
If you ain’t got patience,
you probably shouldn’t
be out there hunting.

28:14.193 --> 28:16.933
RJ: The ducks, you know,
seem to be a little bit
more active.

28:17.029 --> 28:18.799
You know, deer hunting’s
not really an option.

28:18.897 --> 28:20.897
Why not go duck hunting and
make good use of the day.

28:25.537 --> 28:29.237
Definitely try to keep
your head down here.

28:32.444 --> 28:36.684
ROBERT: I’ve been working with
my dog to become a proficient
duck hunter and retriever.

28:36.782 --> 28:39.452
Hopefully, We’ll get my
dog on her first duck.

28:39.551 --> 28:41.351
(noises)

28:41.453 --> 28:43.253
Oh, here comes two up
the river.

28:45.924 --> 28:46.764
RJ: Go ahead.

28:46.858 --> 28:48.758
(gunshot)

28:48.860 --> 28:50.360
Gotta lead it a
little more.

28:50.462 --> 28:51.702
ROBERT: These suckers
are hauling butt.

28:51.797 --> 28:53.827
Are they coming up here
or leaving the bay?

28:53.932 --> 28:55.972
I hope they’re not
leaving the bay.

28:56.068 --> 28:57.638
Here they come, lower
our heads and duck.

28:59.071 --> 29:00.241
They’re turning. Ah
they turned out.

29:00.339 --> 29:02.109
(duck calling sound)

29:05.811 --> 29:06.951
RJ: Don’t shoot yet.

29:07.045 --> 29:09.205
They don’t really wanna come
sit right here quite yet.

29:09.314 --> 29:10.824
Maybe the tide’s
not high enough.

29:15.220 --> 29:18.360
ROBERT: Might get some good
jump shooting if I could
walk around over there

29:18.457 --> 29:20.587
and then maybe I could
get some to come back
to you, too.

29:20.692 --> 29:22.362
What do you think?
RJ: That’d be awesome.

29:22.461 --> 29:23.601
ROBERT: I think I’m
gonna give it a shot.

29:26.331 --> 29:28.801
I think we’re just gonna
change our strategy a little
bit and see what happens.

29:30.035 --> 29:34.115
My freezer’s low and we
don’t have a lot of food
piled up for the winter.

29:34.206 --> 29:36.776
We gotta get some ducks.

29:36.875 --> 29:38.935
(duck calling sound)

29:41.813 --> 29:43.453
Looks like he’s got one
flying over right now.

29:43.548 --> 29:44.578
Worth a shot.

29:46.285 --> 29:47.495
Two of them.

29:54.092 --> 29:55.262
RJ: (bleep).

29:56.561 --> 29:57.401
Sorry, Dad.

29:59.765 --> 30:01.035
ROBERT: I heard
RJ shoot just now.

30:01.133 --> 30:05.143
He jumped on the ducks
I was going to put my
stock on up,

30:05.237 --> 30:09.137
maybe if I hang out they’ll
fly back and maybe I’ll get
another chance at ’em.

30:12.678 --> 30:13.808
RJ: They’re leaving.

30:17.182 --> 30:18.982
Too damn smart.

30:20.319 --> 30:21.219
ROBERT: Hey, bud.
RJ: Hey.

30:23.255 --> 30:26.295
ROBERT: I think the
bay is dead.
RJ: Yeah.

30:26.391 --> 30:27.931
I think they’re smart.
ROBERT: I was hoping you
would have got that one

30:28.026 --> 30:29.886
when you shot when I
was over there.

30:29.995 --> 30:31.335
RJ: Yeah, it was a
straight on shot.

30:31.430 --> 30:34.270
Probably about forty
five, fifty yards so I
felt pretty confident.

30:34.366 --> 30:35.866
It was coming right at me.

30:35.967 --> 30:39.267
But, I just don’t’ think
I lead it far enough.
ROBERT: Oh yeah.

30:39.371 --> 30:41.871
I was thinking about
something when I was
over there.

30:42.541 --> 30:45.741
Change up tactics
a little and try to do
what Grandpa used to do,

30:45.844 --> 30:48.754
maybe hit that beach down
the way. What do you think?

30:48.847 --> 30:50.107
RJ: Let’s give it a shot.

30:55.954 --> 30:58.994
JOHNNY: This time of year
can be challenging with
the frozen ground,

30:59.091 --> 30:59.761
and all the snow.

31:00.926 --> 31:04.026
You don’t wanna get
into a potentially
dangerous situation.

31:04.129 --> 31:07.029
You gotta know when it’s
time to get things done.

31:10.969 --> 31:14.309
I just discovered that
the birds, the squirrels,

31:14.406 --> 31:19.776
have been stealing my
chinking out of the cabin.

31:19.878 --> 31:23.248
So, I’m going to get more
moss down on the lake.

31:24.182 --> 31:27.092
The moss there is very
thick, very dense.

31:27.185 --> 31:30.045
And that’s the moss
I’m looking for to
re-insulate the cabin.

31:32.524 --> 31:37.664
Moss generally grows thick
on this side of the lake.

31:37.763 --> 31:40.873
It’s kind of the northern
side of the lake,

31:40.966 --> 31:44.596
and every time I’ve been
over here I generally see

31:44.703 --> 31:47.973
thicker moss than
anywhere in this area.

31:49.274 --> 31:52.084
Only difference is, it’s
covered in snow now.

31:52.177 --> 31:54.947
So, it might be frozen.
Got the axe.

31:55.046 --> 31:58.276
I just gotta kinda dig
under the snow and hope
for the best.

32:01.052 --> 32:02.222
There’s some.

32:03.622 --> 32:10.362
It’s actually not super
common to find, big fluffy
pillows of moss like this.

32:10.462 --> 32:13.772
It’s like the snow
kinda insulated the moss
from freezing too much.

32:13.865 --> 32:16.565
You know, if I waited
a couple more weeks this
would just be frozen solid.

32:17.936 --> 32:20.536
This is coming up
real nicely.

32:20.639 --> 32:24.079
That’s what I’m after,
right there, big old
pillow of moss.

32:27.145 --> 32:30.515
I’m honestly pretty lucky
that I have this opportunity
to still grab it,

32:30.615 --> 32:33.445
and often this just freezes
really, really hard.

32:33.552 --> 32:35.522
Get the resources while
you can, be prepared.

32:40.325 --> 32:42.355
It’s good to come down and
check on the old canoe.

32:49.734 --> 32:54.114
It just started snowing
kinda larger amounts
last night.

32:54.206 --> 32:55.436
I wonder how strong
the ice is.

32:57.576 --> 32:59.036
Let’s see if I can
walk on it.

33:02.514 --> 33:03.724
This is my highway.

33:04.282 --> 33:12.422
Everything I do is on these
lakes, hauling firewood,
hunting, fishing.

33:12.524 --> 33:16.434
And this time of year, it’s
always a questionable time
walking around on ice.

33:19.698 --> 33:22.968
And it’s never the most
um comforting feeling.

33:23.068 --> 33:25.238

look at those chompers.

38:59.871 --> 39:03.841
But he’s thrashing around,
I don’t want to get this
hook caught in me

it slow and careful.

felt like the same bite.

39:43.081 --> 39:46.151
Oh wow, that’s a little
baby.

39:46.251 --> 39:50.861
Okay. We caught the biggest
fish in the lake and now
we caught the smallest.

39:50.955 --> 39:52.015
That’s crazy.

39:52.123 --> 39:54.093
Is that a pike too? That
looks like a small pike.

just gonna put this
one back to be honest.

40:52.083 --> 40:55.423
RJ: As a duck hunter I
would say that one of the
biggest things is just

40:55.520 --> 40:58.460
letting the ducks come into
the decoys and trying to get
in as close as possible

40:58.556 --> 41:01.586
so you can have as confident
of a shot as possible.

41:01.693 --> 41:04.403

to let them get a little
bit closer.

41:12.403 --> 41:13.673

RJ: Hold on.

41:13.771 --> 41:15.541
ROBERT: Do you see
something flying?

41:15.640 --> 41:18.210

were swans or geese calling.

41:22.046 --> 41:27.176

about a hundred yards.

41:32.190 --> 41:34.730

41:34.826 --> 41:39.226

keep bumping up with the
tide coming in, probably.

41:42.033 --> 41:43.903

ninety yards.

Way too far to
shoot into the wind.

enough, we’ll pop up,
they’ll fly and shoot ’em.

when they’re on the ground.

47:45.696 --> 47:49.566
They even eat each other,
pretty fearsome predator.

47:49.667 --> 47:52.197
Look at this fish’s
length and weight, I know.

47:52.303 --> 47:56.043
If I rationed it out this
one fish could probably
keep me well fed

47:56.140 --> 47:59.840
and well nourished for, you
know probably several weeks.

47:59.944 --> 48:03.114
It’s an immense amount
of calories, fat,
everything I need.

48:03.214 --> 48:04.314
It’s a prize to be sure.

48:06.217 --> 48:10.517
This, I assume this is
his stomach so let’s see
what he’s been up to.

48:10.621 --> 48:14.121
Oh dang, looks like it’s
full of another fish.
Check that out.

48:14.225 --> 48:16.765
That looks like fish meat.

48:16.861 --> 48:20.431
He’s got a whole ’nother
fish in his stomach,
that’s why he’s so fat.

48:20.531 --> 48:23.131
He hasn’t even digested
it. Look at that.

48:23.234 --> 48:25.144
Looks like a white fish.
He just ate this,

48:25.236 --> 48:27.596
probably just an hour
or something before I
caught him.

48:27.705 --> 48:30.115
Here’s another species of
fish I could be catching
as well.

48:30.207 --> 48:33.677
I think I got everything
out that I want
to, I’m going to leave,

48:33.778 --> 48:35.608
I’m going to leave these
eggs right in here just

48:35.713 --> 48:38.323
so that they’re kinda
safely transported.

48:38.416 --> 48:40.976
I’ll just give this a dip
in the water to get the
blood off and then,

48:41.085 --> 48:42.855
and then get out of here.

48:48.125 --> 48:52.755
JESSI: Every single animal I
harvest makes it possible for
me to live this lifestyle,

48:52.863 --> 48:55.303
and I don’t take
that lightly.

49:03.574 --> 49:06.544
Ugh!! (bleep).
I hate this.

49:06.644 --> 49:09.354
CHRIS: It just flopped
to the other side.

49:09.447 --> 49:11.147
JESSI: Okay.
CHRIS: Man this thing’s tough.

49:17.455 --> 49:21.765
Ugh!! I need a,
I need a break.

49:21.859 --> 49:24.229
JESSI: Holy cow.

49:24.328 --> 49:27.528
CHRIS: Oh my god, can you
hold this from moving?
JESSI: Yeah, hold on.

49:28.566 --> 49:30.166
Okay I got it. Got it?

49:30.267 --> 49:32.097
Leaning sideways?

49:32.203 --> 49:34.743
(labored breathing)

49:34.839 --> 49:36.169
CHRIS: It’s killing me.

49:36.273 --> 49:39.113
We still got at least a
mile to trudge back to
the snow machine.

49:39.210 --> 49:41.110
I don’t think I can pull
this up another mountain.

49:41.212 --> 49:41.982
JESSI: Okay.

49:42.813 --> 49:44.953
Let’s just cut him
right here, right?

49:45.049 --> 49:47.849
I’ll take some of the meat,
you’ll take some of the meat

49:47.952 --> 49:50.122
and we’ll just butch
it right here.

49:53.123 --> 49:55.433
CHRIS: I think that
quartering up’s going
to be the best bet.

49:55.526 --> 49:58.356
Won’t be tipping over.

49:58.462 --> 50:00.862
By the time we get this
chopped up and back to
the snow machine

50:00.965 --> 50:04.975
it’s going to be full
blown snowstorm.

50:05.069 --> 50:08.109
JESSI: Holy smokes
it’s coming in, right?
CHRIS: Yeah.

50:08.205 --> 50:10.735
JESSI: You can’t see
anything anymore.
CHRIS: Yeah.

50:10.841 --> 50:12.181
JESSI: We need to
get out of here fast.

50:18.516 --> 50:21.316
CHRIS: The only thing
we need to do still is
take the uh fur

50:21.418 --> 50:23.848
and place it over all
the pieces we cut up,

50:23.954 --> 50:28.194
flip it over, just like
that and tuck him in.

50:32.263 --> 50:34.433
Leave him with a
little bit of dignity.

50:34.532 --> 50:36.632
I learned this from the
elders, they always said

50:36.734 --> 50:38.904
just try to leave as much
respect as you can.

50:40.671 --> 50:42.171
JESSI: Thank you, caribou.

50:43.007 --> 50:44.407
CHRIS: Thank you for
your life, caribou.

50:44.508 --> 50:47.908
You will feed us long
into winter. We really
appreciate you.

50:48.012 --> 50:50.412
All right, let’s load
up and get out of here.

50:50.514 --> 50:52.384
Tie this last bit up.

50:52.483 --> 50:54.453
JESSI: Gosh, you can’t see
anything. Look at that.

50:54.552 --> 50:58.162
CHRIS: I know, I’m hoping
we don’t lose sight
of where we came from.

50:58.255 --> 51:01.755
We use the mountains
as kind of like a guide
but, they’re long gone.

51:01.859 --> 51:05.129
And it’s still at least another
mile ’til the snow machine.

51:05.229 --> 51:07.529

Yeah, it was a great
day fishing, caught
this big monster.

57:55.439 --> 57:59.909
I learned a lot more
about the lake, what’s
underneath the water,

58:00.010 --> 58:02.510
how deep it is in
different places. So,

58:02.612 --> 58:06.452
that’s all gonna help me
once it gets to ice
fishing season. And

I can keep catching
monsters like this.

this you won’t feel
any of that cold.

starts coming in,

you’re either behind or
you’re playing catch up.

So, I’m always trying to stay
in tune with what’s going on
in nature, with the animals.

1:00:04.501 --> 1:00:07.501
And I’m always trying to
be as prepared as possible.

I say old man winter
throw what you want at me,
because I’m ready for you.
