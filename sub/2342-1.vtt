01:51.362 --> 01:54.282
Hi. I'm Elise.
You must be Lorraine.

01:54.365 --> 01:57.619
Yes. Nice to meet you.
I'm sorry it's so late.

01:57.702 --> 02:00.830
My dayjob kind of makes
raising my son a nightjob.

02:00.914 --> 02:02.248
Don't worry about it.

02:02.332 --> 02:06.127
In my line of work, things tend
to happen when it gets dark.

02:06.211 --> 02:07.545
Please.
Thank you.

02:15.678 --> 02:16.721
Ahoy, Carl!

02:18.515 --> 02:20.642
Elise, thank you for coming.

02:21.226 --> 02:24.145
I didn't know what else
to do, except call you.

02:24.229 --> 02:25.939
Oh, I understand.

02:26.022 --> 02:27.816
You had a big problem
and you thought

02:27.899 --> 02:30.151
you'd make it my problem, too.
Is that it?

02:31.528 --> 02:32.654
Uh, uh...

02:32.737 --> 02:34.489
I'm teasing.

02:34.572 --> 02:37.408
You know I'm always
happy to help, Carl.

02:37.492 --> 02:39.410
Would you like
some coffee or tea?

02:39.494 --> 02:41.329
No, thank you.

02:41.412 --> 02:43.998
I'd like to get started
right away, if that's okay.

02:44.082 --> 02:45.625
Carl told me on the phone

02:45.708 --> 02:48.336
your son is the one
affected, is that right?

02:48.419 --> 02:49.838
Yes, that's right.

02:49.921 --> 02:51.422
My son, Josh.

02:52.298 --> 02:54.300
Something is following him.

02:56.344 --> 02:57.887
Show her.

03:00.306 --> 03:02.559
I started with
all the usual checks,

03:02.642 --> 03:04.978
mental health tests,
medical records.

03:05.061 --> 03:06.646
Everything normal.

03:08.606 --> 03:09.899
Then I saw the photos.

03:11.317 --> 03:14.195
First noticed it
about six weeks ago.

03:14.279 --> 03:16.698
Thought it was
a camera problem.

03:16.781 --> 03:19.701
Then it became apparent
that it was more than that.

03:21.286 --> 03:22.871
I interviewed the boy.

03:23.788 --> 03:25.748
He won't tell me anything.
He's afraid.

03:28.126 --> 03:29.460
I'm afraid, too.

03:29.794 --> 03:32.839
There's something in this house.
I can feel it.

03:33.548 --> 03:35.091
It doesn't want me here.

03:55.153 --> 03:56.613
May I meet him?

03:59.282 --> 04:01.743
<i>Hi, Josh. I'm Elise.</i>

04:01.826 --> 04:04.537
<i>I would love to ask you
some simple questions.</i>

04:05.163 --> 04:06.748
<i>Do you like living here?</i>

04:06.831 --> 04:08.917
Yeah, I guess.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.794
Are there a lot of kids your
age in this neighborhood?

04:12.629 --> 04:15.590
<i>A few.
One kid lives next door.</i>

04:15.673 --> 04:17.300
That must be fun.

04:17.884 --> 04:22.221
Is there anything you don't like
about living in this house?

04:28.102 --> 04:29.812
<i>I have bad dreams sometimes.</i>

04:30.355 --> 04:32.190
What happens in your dreams?

04:36.611 --> 04:39.113
I'd like to try something
with you, Josh.

04:39.197 --> 04:42.158
And I promise, it won't hurt.

04:47.705 --> 04:49.707
I want you to just relax.

04:51.542 --> 04:53.419
Listen to the ticking.

04:53.503 --> 04:54.963
Focus on it.

04:55.046 --> 04:57.048
Tune everything else out.

04:58.299 --> 05:00.593
Feel yourself getting sleepier.

05:03.346 --> 05:05.723
We are now inside
your dream, Josh.

05:06.307 --> 05:08.184
Look around.

05:08.267 --> 05:09.769
What do you see?

05:12.605 --> 05:14.357
I see myself

05:15.316 --> 05:17.360
sleeping in bed.

05:17.443 --> 05:19.404
Are you in your bedroom?

05:20.405 --> 05:22.281
No.

05:22.365 --> 05:24.242
I'm somewhere dark.

05:24.993 --> 05:26.661
It's always dark here.

05:26.744 --> 05:28.538
Are you alone?

05:29.831 --> 05:31.249
No.

05:32.333 --> 05:33.626
She's here.

05:33.710 --> 05:35.128
Who is "she"?

05:36.004 --> 05:38.381
She says she's a friend.

05:39.507 --> 05:41.718
She visits me every night.

05:42.760 --> 05:45.430
Where is she
right at this moment?

05:46.055 --> 05:48.599
Is she here in
this house with us?

05:49.892 --> 05:51.894
I'd like to talk to her.

06:01.112 --> 06:05.408
Okay, we're gonna play
a little game, Josh.

06:05.491 --> 06:07.452
It's called Hot and Cold.

06:08.036 --> 06:09.996
<i>I'll walk around the house,</i>

06:10.079 --> 06:14.042
<i>and you tell me if I'm
getting warmer or colder.</i>

06:24.886 --> 06:26.471
Cold.

06:41.986 --> 06:43.154
Warm.

07:04.425 --> 07:05.843
<i>Warmer.</i>

07:17.146 --> 07:19.190
Colder.

07:44.924 --> 07:46.592
<i>Getting warm.</i>

07:54.475 --> 07:56.310
Hotter.

08:00.731 --> 08:02.233
It's very hot.

08:16.747 --> 08:19.000
Please get out of there.

08:22.837 --> 08:24.547
Who are you?

08:25.715 --> 08:27.300
What do you want?

08:47.028 --> 08:48.029
What happened?

08:48.112 --> 08:50.198
I saw what haunts him,
and it's not a friend.

08:50.281 --> 08:54.118
It's a parasite. I've never
felt such a malignant presence.

08:54.202 --> 08:56.162
It wants to be him.

08:56.287 --> 08:57.580
Miss Lambert,

08:57.663 --> 09:01.250
I think your son has a
unique ability, a gift.

09:01.334 --> 09:05.171
When he sleeps at night, he's
able to go places, see things.

09:06.130 --> 09:08.716
Things no living person
is supposed to see.

09:09.467 --> 09:13.387
Only now, one of the
dead has seen him, too.

09:13.930 --> 09:15.348
Oh, my God.

09:17.141 --> 09:18.476
Well, can you stop it?

09:20.478 --> 09:21.896
I could take away his gift

09:21.979 --> 09:24.440
to suppress his memory
of his ability.

09:24.523 --> 09:25.858
How would we do that?

09:32.240 --> 09:34.033
I'll show you.

10:05.940 --> 10:09.402
Do whatever you have to.
Make him forget.

12:47.017 --> 12:50.688
One morning, Dalton
just wouldn't wake up.

12:52.189 --> 12:54.483
We took him to the best
doctors we could find,

12:54.567 --> 12:57.278
but none of them had any idea.

12:58.028 --> 13:01.574
Eventually,
we just took him home,

13:01.657 --> 13:03.701
still in his coma.

13:04.535 --> 13:08.080
Then things started
happening around the house.

13:09.123 --> 13:10.624
Unexplained things.

13:10.708 --> 13:13.294
I got so freaked out, we moved.

13:13.377 --> 13:15.379
But they kept happening.

13:15.963 --> 13:21.302
And you believe that there was
some sort of supernatural force at work?

13:23.554 --> 13:26.265
When did you hire the services

13:26.348 --> 13:28.350
of the deceased Elise Rainier?

13:29.560 --> 13:32.396
When we ran out
of places to go.

13:33.772 --> 13:36.317
It says in your
statement, Mrs. Lambert,

13:36.400 --> 13:40.321
that last night, at
approximately 10:00 p.m.,

13:40.404 --> 13:44.283
Elise put your husband
into a state of hypnosis.

13:44.366 --> 13:47.161
She did this as
part of a ritual that

13:47.244 --> 13:50.831
she believed would allow him to

13:50.915 --> 13:56.170
"project his unconscious
into a..." Uh...

13:56.253 --> 13:59.381
I'm sorry, I can't read
my own handwriting.

13:59.465 --> 14:04.345
"...Into a spirit realm, where
he could locate your son

14:04.428 --> 14:08.015
"and bring him back
to consciousness."

14:10.935 --> 14:14.939
Now, did you really
believe that would help?

14:16.815 --> 14:19.860
I had to. Whatever she
did, it worked.

14:19.944 --> 14:21.779
Dalton woke up.

14:22.446 --> 14:25.449
And what happened
after your son woke up?

14:29.703 --> 14:30.913
RENAII Josh!

14:32.748 --> 14:34.833
Josh, where are you?

14:35.668 --> 14:37.545
Josh!

14:53.143 --> 14:54.270
Renai.

14:54.395 --> 14:56.230
I'm right here.

14:56.313 --> 14:58.232
<i>What'?
Renaâ€œ</i>

15:01.151 --> 15:02.861
Oh, no, no, no.

15:02.945 --> 15:04.488
Elise! Elise!

15:05.030 --> 15:07.575
Mom, get Dalton out of here!
Call an ambulance!

15:07.658 --> 15:08.867
No, no, no. Elise!

15:08.951 --> 15:10.828
Oh, no!

15:10.911 --> 15:12.288
No, no!

15:16.166 --> 15:17.334
What?

15:17.585 --> 15:19.753
Why are you looking
at me like that?

15:21.297 --> 15:22.715
You think I did this?

15:26.677 --> 15:28.637
Did you believe him?

15:28.762 --> 15:30.556
He's my husband. That's
not what I asked.

15:30.639 --> 15:35.060
Yes, I believed him. My husband
isn't capable of killing anybody.

15:35.853 --> 15:38.981
This is a photo Elise took
seconds before she was killed.

15:39.064 --> 15:41.609
Can you tell me who that
is in this picture?

15:42.610 --> 15:46.989
There were a lot of strange
things happening in our house.

15:47.072 --> 15:49.116
I saw apparitions,
lots of them.

15:49.199 --> 15:52.202
Are you telling me that this
is a photograph of a ghost?

15:52.536 --> 15:55.497
Listen, I'm not interested
in ghosts, Mrs. Lambert.

15:55.581 --> 15:58.208
I'm interested in the living
people who create them.

16:00.919 --> 16:02.713
Elise has marks on her neck

16:02.796 --> 16:04.882
that were put there
by human hands.

16:06.050 --> 16:11.055
I'll let you know if forensics
matches those marks to your husband.

16:20.064 --> 16:21.273
Jessica, we're home.

16:21.357 --> 16:22.316
Hey, guys.

16:22.399 --> 16:26.153
Dad! Look what I made. Hey.

16:26.236 --> 16:27.655
What?
It's a cup phone.

16:27.738 --> 16:29.490
See? You put your ear in that,
and I put my mouth in that.

16:29.573 --> 16:32.868
You are a genius. Absolute brilliance.
Thanks for watching them.

16:32.951 --> 16:34.495
Say hi to your mom from me.
I will.

16:38.874 --> 16:40.501
Oh. Mom,
I'll get that.

16:40.584 --> 16:42.378
I'll go up and make the beds.

16:59.478 --> 17:01.021
All right.

17:01.105 --> 17:02.648
Time for bed, boys.

17:02.731 --> 17:04.441
How long are we
gonna be here for?

17:04.525 --> 17:06.694
We're gonna be at Grandma's
house for a little bit

17:06.777 --> 17:08.820
while the police
work at our house.

17:10.280 --> 17:14.117
You know, this house has been
in the family for a long time.

17:14.201 --> 17:15.868
And you guys

17:17.287 --> 17:19.790
get to stay in
Daddy's old bedroom.

17:20.040 --> 17:21.875
Did you see
anything bad in here?

17:22.626 --> 17:24.002
No.

17:24.127 --> 17:26.588
And neither will you, okay?

17:26.672 --> 17:27.798
Okay.

17:27.923 --> 17:29.299
Good night.

17:33.053 --> 17:35.055
What?

17:35.639 --> 17:37.349
Just glad you're awake.

17:41.145 --> 17:42.479
Good night, boys.

17:42.563 --> 17:43.647
Good night.

17:47.901 --> 17:49.403
Hey, Dalton.

17:49.486 --> 17:50.738
What?

17:51.405 --> 17:52.906
Look what I made.

17:52.990 --> 17:54.491
Do I have to?

17:55.325 --> 17:56.744
Yeah.

17:58.495 --> 17:59.538
This is stupid.

18:00.080 --> 18:03.208
Come on, it really works. I wanna
ask you something, all right?

18:03.292 --> 18:04.710
All right, fine. The
string needs to be tight.

18:04.793 --> 18:06.587
Go farther back.
Okay.

18:07.671 --> 18:09.965
So, what do you think of this?

18:11.300 --> 18:12.551
I think it's stupid.

18:12.634 --> 18:13.969
Hey.

19:02.768 --> 19:04.228
Lorraine?

21:16.443 --> 21:17.444
It's okay.

21:19.071 --> 21:20.697
It's still happening.
What is?

21:20.781 --> 21:22.866
I heard the piano playing
by itself downstairs

21:22.950 --> 21:25.494
and I found Kali on the floor
of her room by her crib!

21:25.577 --> 21:26.870
Well, maybe she
climbed out of her crib.

21:26.954 --> 21:28.372
Has she ever done that before?

21:28.455 --> 21:30.207
What? What is
wrong with you?

21:30.540 --> 21:32.876
Renai, I just want us to move
on from this, that's all.

21:32.960 --> 21:34.440
I want us to be
a normal family again.

21:34.670 --> 21:37.756
There is nothing normal about this, okay?
These things are still here.

21:37.839 --> 21:41.093
Elise is dead! No one's talking about it!
Someone murdered her!

21:41.343 --> 21:43.303
Then let's talk about it.

21:43.387 --> 21:44.888
You think I did it?

21:46.848 --> 21:49.142
No. No, I don't.

21:49.226 --> 21:50.477
Good. Good.

21:50.560 --> 21:51.853
Because I know what happened.

21:51.937 --> 21:54.272
I went into that place
to get our son back

21:54.356 --> 21:57.442
and something evil followed
me and killed Elise.

21:58.235 --> 22:00.195
You saw it.

22:00.278 --> 22:01.822
You saw those things.

22:03.699 --> 22:06.702
Listen to me. Nothing is gonna
bother us, not anymore.

22:07.452 --> 22:09.162
We have our family back.

22:10.247 --> 22:11.915
We have our son.

22:12.874 --> 22:15.002
Isn't that what
we should be focusing on?

22:17.546 --> 22:19.172
Yeah.

22:47.951 --> 22:49.995
You think all the
ghosts we've seen

22:50.078 --> 22:53.123
would somehow make me feel
better that Elise is gone.

22:53.832 --> 22:56.043
I mean, you and I have

22:56.126 --> 22:59.629
firsthand knowledge that there's
something out there beyond death.

23:02.632 --> 23:04.926
But it's not helping.

23:08.430 --> 23:12.059
Turns out the living version
of someone is always better.

23:30.494 --> 23:33.205
She never left the
reading room unlocked.

23:45.884 --> 23:47.636
You first.

23:49.513 --> 23:51.181
Hunter, ninja, bear.

23:55.644 --> 23:57.104
Hunter, ninja, bear.

24:02.150 --> 24:03.652
That's bullshit.

24:06.196 --> 24:08.115
How does a bear
beat a goddamn ninja?

24:08.198 --> 24:10.033
Superior sense
of smell, my friend.

24:26.049 --> 24:28.089
You know what? I don't think
we should be down here.

24:28.135 --> 24:30.428
Let's go back.

24:39.229 --> 24:42.107
That's a private room.
You should stay...

24:42.732 --> 24:44.734
See?
Oh, my nuts!

24:45.735 --> 24:47.320
I'm not helping.

25:09.301 --> 25:11.636
<i>Hi, Josh. I'm Elise.</i>

25:12.137 --> 25:13.138
Hey.

25:13.221 --> 25:15.473
<i>I would love to ask you
some simple questions.</i>

25:16.016 --> 25:18.643
<i>But they're the good kind,
the kind you can't get wrong.</i>

25:18.727 --> 25:19.978
<i>Do you like living here?</i>

25:20.061 --> 25:21.146
Yeah.

25:21.229 --> 25:24.232
Amateur framing.
Just horrible.

25:26.568 --> 25:28.236
<i>A few.
One kid lives next door.</i>

25:31.656 --> 25:33.033
<i>Can you stop it?</i>

25:33.116 --> 25:35.202
<i>I could try
to take away his gift</i>

25:35.285 --> 25:37.454
<i>to suppress his
memory of his ability.</i>

25:37.537 --> 25:38.830
<i>How would we do that?</i>

25:38.914 --> 25:40.123
<i>I'll show you.</i>

25:49.507 --> 25:51.134
Who the hell's he talking to?

25:51.343 --> 25:53.428
<i>I could try
to take away his gift,</i>

25:53.511 --> 25:55.180
<i>to suppress his
memory of his ability.</i>

25:55.263 --> 25:56.389
<i>How would we do that?</i>

25:56.473 --> 25:57.515
<i>I'll show you.</i>

25:58.725 --> 25:59.726
Right there.

26:45.021 --> 26:48.066
sleep.
Then I flew away.

26:51.486 --> 26:53.989
Please don't leave us again.

26:58.618 --> 26:59.661
Grandma?

27:00.662 --> 27:01.663
Mmm-hmm.

27:02.998 --> 27:05.417
There's someone
standing behind you.

28:38.093 --> 28:39.594
Renai?

29:39.696 --> 29:40.822
Oh, my God, Josh!
Mom!

29:40.905 --> 29:42.574
Did you see her?
I saw someone!

29:43.032 --> 29:44.617
No, you didn't. No, I did!
There was somebody...

29:44.701 --> 29:46.077
Ma, there is no one here, okay?

29:46.161 --> 29:48.288
Because if there was,
that would scare my family,

29:48.371 --> 29:51.124
and I don't need Renai hearing
any of that stuff right now.

29:51.875 --> 29:52.959
Understand?

29:56.838 --> 29:58.965
Yeah, you're right.
Um...

29:59.382 --> 30:00.717
It was probably my imagination.

30:01.092 --> 30:02.135
Yeah.

30:02.218 --> 30:04.721
Sorry. You should
get some sleep.

30:28.286 --> 30:29.537
You want some more?

30:32.332 --> 30:35.960
All right, go farther back so we can stretch it.
We need to make it tight.

30:37.170 --> 30:38.463
Daddy?

30:38.546 --> 30:40.173
I gotcha! I gotcha!
Oh, my God!

30:40.256 --> 30:42.008
I'm going to eat you.

30:42.091 --> 30:43.092
Mom?

30:44.052 --> 30:45.803
Hey, honey, what do you
want for breakfast?

30:47.388 --> 30:49.182
Anything you want.

30:52.268 --> 30:53.436
I don't care.

30:56.022 --> 30:57.315
What's wrong?

30:58.274 --> 31:00.151
What's the matter?
You can tell me.

31:02.070 --> 31:03.404
I had a bad dream.

31:06.282 --> 31:07.534
Okay.

31:07.617 --> 31:09.953
I'm sorry.
What was it about?

31:11.621 --> 31:14.082
I was in my bed sleeping.

31:14.958 --> 31:16.543
Grandma walked in.

31:20.505 --> 31:22.465
I could see someone
else in my room.

31:22.799 --> 31:24.968
<i>Please don't leave us again.</i>

31:28.805 --> 31:30.515
<i>Grandma?</i>

31:31.057 --> 31:32.183
<i>Mmm-hmm.</i>

31:32.684 --> 31:35.228
<i>There's someone
standing behind you.</i>

31:40.149 --> 31:42.527
I tried to wake myself up.

31:42.610 --> 31:45.280
It took a while, but I did it.

31:45.363 --> 31:47.824
I heard voices in the hallway.

31:54.956 --> 31:56.124
You got to go.

31:56.583 --> 31:57.667
You have to go.

31:57.750 --> 31:58.751
<i>It was Daddy.</i>

31:58.835 --> 31:59.794
You have to leave.

31:59.877 --> 32:02.005
And he was talking to someone.

32:04.048 --> 32:05.592
You have to go.

32:12.974 --> 32:15.018
Is there something
wrong with Daddy, Mom?

32:16.853 --> 32:18.354
No.

32:18.855 --> 32:19.856
No, honey.

32:19.939 --> 32:21.899
He's just been through a lot.

32:21.983 --> 32:24.569
That's all.
We all have.

32:24.652 --> 32:26.821
It's okay, it's just a dream.

32:27.989 --> 32:30.241
I'm gonna take
the boys to school.

32:30.325 --> 32:32.118
You should rest, relax a bit.

32:35.204 --> 32:36.623
Come on, son.

32:39.042 --> 32:40.043
Okay.

32:54.223 --> 32:55.433
Are you okay, Lorraine?

32:55.516 --> 32:56.517
You said something was wrong.

32:56.601 --> 32:59.604
Whatever it was
that killed Elise,

33:00.730 --> 33:04.067
whatever it was that
was haunting my family

33:05.610 --> 33:07.403
is not done with us.

33:09.072 --> 33:13.451
Last night I saw
someone in my house.

33:15.411 --> 33:16.913
I need your help.

33:17.538 --> 33:20.083
Do you remember the first
time Elise visited your house

33:20.166 --> 33:22.210
to talk to Josh
when he was a boy?

33:22.293 --> 33:25.129
No. I did a lot
to try to...

33:25.213 --> 33:28.800
Try to forget that part of
my life, until recently.

33:28.883 --> 33:31.344
All right. Well,
Elise hypnotized him,

33:31.427 --> 33:33.554
asked him a series
of questions.

33:33.638 --> 33:36.974
I digitized the actual footage
taken from the night.

33:38.059 --> 33:41.604
I cropped and
lightened the image.

33:45.066 --> 33:46.067
What?

33:46.484 --> 33:48.903
Lorraine, is that Josh?

33:50.405 --> 33:51.864
How is that possible?

33:53.282 --> 33:54.742
We don't know.

33:56.077 --> 33:58.538
If only Elise
were here to help us.

34:06.129 --> 34:07.588
What?

34:28.317 --> 34:29.318
Hello?

34:29.402 --> 34:32.196
<i>Renai Lambert,
this is Detective Sendai.</i>

34:32.487 --> 34:33.489
Oh.

34:33.822 --> 34:35.491
Hello, Detective.

34:35.574 --> 34:39.078
<i>I told you I would inform you
once I got the forensics results.</i>

34:39.161 --> 34:40.371
<i>Well, I got some.</i>

34:40.496 --> 34:43.248
<i>It seems the bruises
on Elise Rainier's neck</i>

34:43.331 --> 34:45.752
<i>do not match your
husband's hands.</i>

34:45.835 --> 34:48.087
<i>We're not ruling
anything out at this point,</i>

34:48.170 --> 34:49.964
<i>but I just thought
you should know.</i>

34:51.424 --> 34:53.426
Thank you, Detective.
Uh...

34:55.094 --> 34:58.097
I really needed to hear that.
Thank you.

35:54.195 --> 35:58.074
<i>â™ª Row, row, row your boat</i>

35:59.242 --> 36:02.787
<i>â™ª Gently down the stream</i>

36:19.595 --> 36:24.183
â™ª Merrily,
merrily, merrily, merrily

36:24.267 --> 36:28.771
<i>â™ª Life is but a dream a'</i>

36:30.273 --> 36:31.816
Kali?

36:33.776 --> 36:35.486
Kali?

36:35.570 --> 36:37.697
Kali, what's wrong?

36:39.866 --> 36:41.826
Kali! Kali!

36:41.909 --> 36:46.706
What a beautiful little girl.

36:46.789 --> 36:48.124
Don't you dare!

36:49.292 --> 36:50.710
Jesus!

36:55.590 --> 36:58.050
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!

37:05.892 --> 37:07.310
Kali!

37:08.352 --> 37:09.353
Kali!

37:13.316 --> 37:14.734
Kali!

37:14.817 --> 37:16.402
Kali!

37:16.485 --> 37:18.946
Kali? Baby?

37:19.030 --> 37:21.240
My baby, Kali. Kali.

37:21.324 --> 37:22.909
Don't you dare!

37:41.636 --> 37:43.346
He's here.

37:45.681 --> 37:48.935
Carl, I'm Specs. I'm the guy
you spoke to on the phone.

37:49.018 --> 37:50.645
Oh, hello!
Come in.

37:52.021 --> 37:53.773
Hi, Carl.
Oh.

37:53.856 --> 37:55.858
It's been a long time.

37:55.942 --> 37:57.234
Yeah.

37:58.694 --> 38:00.947
Looks like I did the
aging for the both of us.

38:01.030 --> 38:02.239
Oh, please stop it.

38:02.323 --> 38:04.784
You met Specs.
This is Tucker.

38:06.452 --> 38:09.080
Elise talked about you a lot.

38:09.205 --> 38:10.915
Oh. Yeah, said you were
the second best person

38:10.998 --> 38:11.999
she ever worked with.

38:12.083 --> 38:14.335
Second best, that's generous.

38:16.045 --> 38:20.257
I had been meaning to catch
up with her, to call her.

38:20.341 --> 38:22.927
But I always kept putting it off
till the next week, you know?

38:23.010 --> 38:25.221
And now she's gone.

38:25.304 --> 38:28.307
Well, maybe this is your
chance to say your good-byes.

38:28.391 --> 38:31.978
Specs told me on the phone,
but I'm not sure we should...

38:32.061 --> 38:33.896
We have questions
that need answering,

38:33.980 --> 38:37.316
and the only person we could
think of to ask is Elise.

38:38.442 --> 38:40.111
Please help us, Carl.

38:40.736 --> 38:42.488
Help us contact her.

38:44.824 --> 38:47.660
Everybody has their
own way of making contact.

38:47.743 --> 38:50.162
This is mine.

38:50.246 --> 38:53.791
I ask questions and the
spirits answer with the dice.

38:54.083 --> 38:55.876
You look for the words
in the letters.

39:01.549 --> 39:03.926
Elise, we are
calling out to you.

39:04.927 --> 39:06.554
Tell us if you are there.

39:19.984 --> 39:22.820
Elise, please talk to us.

39:22.903 --> 39:25.906
Give us a sign that
you can hear my voice.

39:32.121 --> 39:34.665
All right, I suppose
I should've explained

39:34.749 --> 39:36.029
that this isn't
an exact science.

39:37.126 --> 39:39.712
Sometimes contact
can't be made.

39:40.796 --> 39:41.964
Elise.

39:43.466 --> 39:46.510
Please tell me, are you here?

39:48.512 --> 39:49.889
Are you here?

39:59.815 --> 40:01.650
I'l go get...
No!

40:01.734 --> 40:03.152
Do not break the circle.

40:25.049 --> 40:27.051
Elise.

40:27.176 --> 40:29.762
We need to know who killed you.

40:29.845 --> 40:30.846
Tell us.

40:32.890 --> 40:34.683
"She did."

40:48.864 --> 40:50.449
What does she want?

40:53.619 --> 40:54.620
I see it.

40:55.496 --> 40:56.497
Where?

40:57.456 --> 41:01.335
"K-l-L-L."

41:07.925 --> 41:08.926
Where is she?

41:11.345 --> 41:13.055
"Hiding."

41:15.224 --> 41:18.894
Where is she hiding?

41:38.414 --> 41:41.750
Elise, tell us where
to find your killer.

41:45.713 --> 41:49.675
"Our Lady Angls"?

41:49.884 --> 41:51.844
Our Lady Angls,
what does that mean?

41:51.927 --> 41:53.929
It's "Angels."

41:54.346 --> 41:55.764
Our Lady of the Angels.

41:56.140 --> 41:57.558
It's a hospital.

41:59.268 --> 42:01.770
I know because
I used to work there.

42:13.782 --> 42:15.451
Renai?

42:31.884 --> 42:33.594
Renai.

42:49.068 --> 42:52.154
Most of my work
was in this East Wing.

42:52.238 --> 42:55.074
But it's all closed now.

42:55.157 --> 42:56.825
Now only the ghosts are left.

42:57.243 --> 43:00.246
Personally, I
prefer the ghosts to people.

43:03.624 --> 43:06.627
The question is,
what are we looking for?

43:07.670 --> 43:09.713
Elise led us here for a reason.

43:10.422 --> 43:12.549
Just forget
the actual building.

43:12.633 --> 43:15.719
Think of the doctors,
the nurses you worked with,

43:15.803 --> 43:17.596
the patients, everyone.

43:35.531 --> 43:39.827
Mama! Mama!

43:53.966 --> 43:55.551
What is it?

44:05.686 --> 44:07.229
In there.

44:31.211 --> 44:33.130
What was in this room?

44:37.134 --> 44:39.428
This was an ICU.

44:40.763 --> 44:42.931
I remember it very well.

44:47.936 --> 44:49.688
Should we do
pizza night tonight?

44:49.772 --> 44:50.939
How about mac and cheese?

44:51.023 --> 44:52.024
Hi, Pam.
Hi, Lorraine.

44:52.107 --> 44:53.525
Mac and cheese.

44:53.609 --> 44:55.486
Okay, that can be done.

44:57.237 --> 44:59.365
Keep quiet.
Don't touch anything.

45:00.282 --> 45:02.117
How is he?

45:02.201 --> 45:04.661
His vital signs
are stabilizing,

45:04.745 --> 45:06.205
but he's still unresponsive.

45:08.290 --> 45:09.875
His blood
pressure's doing better.

45:09.958 --> 45:11.502
Yes, after we upped the dosage.

45:11.585 --> 45:13.587
- Okay, let's keep him on that.
- Okay.

45:13.670 --> 45:16.256
And when was the last
time you checked the glucose?

45:28.769 --> 45:30.813
It's okay.
It's okay.

45:32.898 --> 45:36.693
<i>A few days
later, I saw him again.</i>

45:37.319 --> 45:38.946
<i>For the last time.</i>

45:57.131 --> 45:59.633
Parker, what are you...

45:59.716 --> 46:02.636
You should be resting.
You shouldn't be out of bed.

46:11.186 --> 46:14.606
Listen, I wanna apologize
for my son the other day.

46:14.690 --> 46:16.859
He was being a nosy kid.

46:36.378 --> 46:39.548
Hey, Hillary, why is the
patient from Room 104

46:39.631 --> 46:40.883
up and walking around?

46:42.050 --> 46:43.385
What do you mean?

46:43.469 --> 46:45.971
The patient from ICU,
Parker Crane?

46:46.555 --> 46:48.640
What do you mean,
walking around?

46:48.724 --> 46:50.976
I just rode down in
the elevator with him.

46:51.059 --> 46:52.644
He should be in bed,
on the monitor...

46:52.728 --> 46:56.440
Lorraine, that patient
died yesterday morning.

46:56.523 --> 46:57.858
What?

46:57.941 --> 46:59.401
He jumped to his death.

47:10.078 --> 47:12.581
So, why was he
here in the first place?

47:14.917 --> 47:18.462
He tried to castrate himself.

47:44.530 --> 47:45.697
Oh, no.

47:46.823 --> 47:48.200
No.

47:48.283 --> 47:50.202
No, not yet.

47:50.285 --> 47:52.412
Please, no.

47:52.496 --> 47:58.544
Your dead soul
is killing his living skin.

47:58.627 --> 48:00.754
I wanna live.

48:00.837 --> 48:02.881
I wanna live!

48:02.965 --> 48:06.885
<i>Only if you kill them.</i>

48:06.969 --> 48:09.388
No. Please, no.

48:09.471 --> 48:11.306
I can't, Mother.

48:11.390 --> 48:13.559
Please don't make me do it.

48:13.642 --> 48:15.602
<i>You must!</i>

48:15.686 --> 48:19.940
<i>Or you'll waste away.</i>

48:33.829 --> 48:35.789
Yes, we can.

48:35.872 --> 48:37.374
No way.
Lorraine!

48:40.419 --> 48:41.878
Is that our man?

48:41.962 --> 48:43.505
Parker Crane, that's him.

48:45.340 --> 48:47.301
This address,
there's something there.

48:58.228 --> 49:00.355
It's okay, it's okay.
Renai.

49:00.897 --> 49:03.609
It's okay. It's okay.
You're okay. You're okay.

49:03.692 --> 49:05.027
Oh, God.
You're okay.

49:05.902 --> 49:07.029
Where's Kali?

49:07.112 --> 49:08.739
She's fine.
She's in her room sleeping.

49:08.864 --> 49:11.408
She's fine. No, she's not!
No, she's not!

49:11.533 --> 49:14.620
She's asleep! RenaH No! No!

49:14.703 --> 49:16.121
Kali.

49:18.373 --> 49:21.293
See? I told you,
she's fine.

49:26.715 --> 49:29.676
Oh, God! What happened? Tell me.

49:29.760 --> 49:30.886
Someone attacked me!

49:31.094 --> 49:32.137
Who?

49:32.220 --> 49:35.140
In the living room, a woman. She hit me.
These things are back, Josh!

49:35.223 --> 49:36.808
We have to go!
We gotta get the kids

49:36.892 --> 49:38.477
and we gotta get
out of the house!

49:38.560 --> 49:39.853
No, it's not the house.
You know that.

49:39.936 --> 49:41.021
We've been through this before.

49:41.104 --> 49:43.482
They will follow us. You
have to just not be afraid.

49:43.565 --> 49:44.816
You have to relax.

49:44.900 --> 49:47.152
Relax? I can't relax!

49:47.235 --> 49:48.403
There's ghosts everywhere!

49:48.487 --> 49:49.821
It's like we're already dead!

49:49.905 --> 49:51.406
No, it's not!

49:52.532 --> 49:53.825
No, it's not.

49:53.909 --> 49:56.244
This is nothing
like being dead.

49:57.079 --> 49:59.831
I know.
I have seen it.

49:59.915 --> 50:01.750
I have seen where
these things exist.

50:02.209 --> 50:03.835
They want what you have.

50:03.919 --> 50:05.337
Life.

50:05.420 --> 50:07.381
But they have
no power over you.

50:07.464 --> 50:11.051
All you have to do is ignore
them, and they will go away.

50:59.891 --> 51:01.810
See, I told you.

51:14.114 --> 51:16.116
What are you doing?

51:21.788 --> 51:23.665
That's the song
that's been playing.

51:24.833 --> 51:26.585
What song?
What are you talking about?

51:29.504 --> 51:30.922
You don't know thatsong?

51:31.673 --> 51:33.258
No, I don't.

51:34.509 --> 51:37.512
That's my song,
the song I wrote for you?

51:42.142 --> 51:44.853
Well, it's not the song that
we should be worried about.

51:47.856 --> 51:50.150
There's somebody in this house.

52:02.704 --> 52:04.289
Stay here.

52:09.211 --> 52:12.506
Hey, look,
they left the window open.

52:18.220 --> 52:19.679
Watch your step.

52:34.945 --> 52:36.655
Do you feel something?

52:36.738 --> 52:37.739
Um...

52:39.407 --> 52:42.369
Let's just say that
this house is not a place

52:42.452 --> 52:44.746
where many good things
have happened.

52:48.750 --> 52:51.461
Probably a lot of good
collectibles in here.

53:06.601 --> 53:07.978
What is that smell?

53:08.979 --> 53:10.021
Hey, Specs.

53:10.105 --> 53:11.106
Yeah.

53:11.940 --> 53:12.983
Upstairs.

54:13.168 --> 54:16.838
I'm guessing this might
be Parker Crane's bedroom.

54:18.089 --> 54:20.342
No, it seems a little
girly for a boy's bedroom,

54:20.425 --> 54:21.426
don't you think?

54:21.509 --> 54:22.844
Why?

54:23.303 --> 54:25.263
I mean, look at this dollhouse.

54:26.473 --> 54:27.974
What?

54:29.684 --> 54:31.394
I had a dollhouse.

54:32.437 --> 54:34.564
This is a Rhode Island Red.

54:35.523 --> 54:37.692
Come on, let's get outta here.

54:50.622 --> 54:51.706
This is my room!

54:56.169 --> 54:57.963
Tucker!

55:34.416 --> 55:36.876
Listen,
Tucker. Tucker.

55:44.759 --> 55:47.095
You can't be in here.

55:51.599 --> 55:55.103
If she sees you,
she'll make me kill you.

56:17.459 --> 56:19.878
Dalton.

56:23.631 --> 56:25.967
<i>Dalton.</i>

56:33.099 --> 56:34.601
What?

56:36.811 --> 56:40.315
<i>I have something to show you.</i>

56:40.940 --> 56:43.234
Stop, Foster.

56:43.318 --> 56:46.404
Just go back to bed. You're
gonna get us in trouble.

56:46.488 --> 56:49.491
<i>I'm not Foster.</i>

57:28.696 --> 57:30.198
Foster, wake up.

57:31.658 --> 57:34.744
Foster, please wake up!

57:56.891 --> 57:57.976
Who are you?

58:00.687 --> 58:03.314
<i>The ones he killed.</i>

58:04.399 --> 58:06.818
<i>We are many.</i>

58:07.402 --> 58:09.154
What do you want?

58:22.667 --> 58:25.211
<i>Please help me!</i>

58:27.630 --> 58:29.841
<i>Make the pain stop!</i>

58:46.608 --> 58:49.485
It's okay! It's okay! It's okay!

58:49.569 --> 58:52.739
It's okay!
It's okay! It's okay!

58:52.822 --> 58:57.202
Oh, Jesus.
Jesus. Oh, Jesus.

58:58.411 --> 59:01.539
It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

59:01.623 --> 59:04.542
It was just a dream.
It's just a dream.

59:04.626 --> 59:06.961
It's just a dream.

59:12.258 --> 59:14.469
You're trying to reach
her, but you won't.

59:16.221 --> 59:18.014
Not from over there.

59:19.974 --> 59:22.018
Shadows are your home now.

59:36.241 --> 59:37.575
<i>Help!</i>

59:58.346 --> 59:59.681
Elise.

01:00:00.431 --> 01:00:01.933
Why did you bring us here?

01:00:12.694 --> 01:00:14.946
What are we looking for?

01:00:29.419 --> 01:00:31.379
<i>"Mors."</i>

01:00:32.046 --> 01:00:34.757
Latin for "Death"?

01:00:49.022 --> 01:00:50.189
Carl.

01:00:51.607 --> 01:00:53.609
This is the woman
who was in my house.

01:00:55.486 --> 01:00:56.696
Lorraine, look out!

01:01:04.912 --> 01:01:06.581
What happened?

01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:12.003
What happened?
Give me a light over here.

01:01:12.086 --> 01:01:13.421
Over here!

01:01:16.591 --> 01:01:18.301
You're not Elise, are you?

01:01:32.774 --> 01:01:34.192
Who are you?

01:01:39.614 --> 01:01:42.241
Mother of Death.

01:01:42.742 --> 01:01:44.535
What does that mean?

01:01:45.078 --> 01:01:46.996
It's literal.

01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:50.041
It simply means the mother

01:01:50.124 --> 01:01:51.834
of Parker Crane.

01:02:29.539 --> 01:02:30.915
Okay, move that.

01:02:34.168 --> 01:02:36.879
One, two, and three.

01:02:43.386 --> 01:02:44.846
Pull it this way.

01:03:53.456 --> 01:03:55.249
Don't touch anything.

01:04:18.648 --> 01:04:19.941
Guys.

01:04:22.401 --> 01:04:24.362
"Bride in Black."

01:04:25.613 --> 01:04:27.156
I know that name.

01:04:28.574 --> 01:04:30.409
Where? What you got?

01:04:32.954 --> 01:04:35.540
"One of the victims
managed to elude the killer.

01:04:35.623 --> 01:04:39.210
"Police said she
described her attacker

01:04:39.293 --> 01:04:44.882
"as an old woman dressed in a
black wedding gown and veil."

01:04:47.426 --> 01:04:50.930
"Bride in Black
claims his 15th victim."

01:04:51.639 --> 01:04:52.682
Victims.

01:04:56.644 --> 01:04:58.104
Oh, my God.

01:05:03.651 --> 01:05:04.860
Wait a sec.

01:05:06.445 --> 01:05:07.530
Uh...

01:05:34.557 --> 01:05:37.518
Parker wore that dress

01:05:37.602 --> 01:05:39.353
to commit these murders.

01:05:40.855 --> 01:05:42.815
It was his disguise.

01:05:44.442 --> 01:05:47.653
He killed for his mother
because she forced him to.

01:05:47.820 --> 01:05:50.323
He wanted his childhood back.

01:05:50.698 --> 01:05:52.700
That's why he went
after your son.

01:06:16.057 --> 01:06:18.768
Renai!
Jesus! Lorraine!

01:06:18.851 --> 01:06:19.935
Where have you been?

01:06:20.019 --> 01:06:21.312
I need to speak to you.

01:06:21.395 --> 01:06:22.480
Where is he, Josh?

01:06:22.563 --> 01:06:24.523
He's not feeling well.
He's been in bed all day.

01:06:24.607 --> 01:06:25.847
And where are
Dalton and Foster?

01:06:25.900 --> 01:06:27.109
I just dropped
them off at Jessica's.

01:06:27.193 --> 01:06:28.653
Why? You and the
kids are in danger.

01:06:28.736 --> 01:06:29.820
I'll explain, but not here.

01:06:29.904 --> 01:06:31.072
Please, let's just
get in the car and go.

01:06:31.405 --> 01:06:32.740
Have you been seeing them, too?

01:06:34.784 --> 01:06:36.369
Around the house?

01:06:37.703 --> 01:06:40.998
It's not the house, it's Josh.

01:07:04.939 --> 01:07:06.732
They're gone.
It's go time.

01:07:06.899 --> 01:07:10.319
Okay.
We'll hear everything.

01:07:10.403 --> 01:07:12.363
Sing out if you need us.

01:07:12.446 --> 01:07:14.990
The code word
is "Quesadilla."

01:07:15.116 --> 01:07:16.717
Say it with me. Quesadilla.
"Quesadilla."

01:07:16.784 --> 01:07:19.036
I thought we agreed on
"Unicorn" as the code word.

01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:21.372
Uh... "Quesadilla" is easier
to bring up in conversation.

01:07:21.455 --> 01:07:22.832
Not at all.
How would you bring up

01:07:22.915 --> 01:07:24.115
"quesadilla" in a conversation?

01:07:24.125 --> 01:07:26.565
It's lunch time. It's quesadilla time.
Guys, guys, guys, guys.

01:07:26.585 --> 01:07:28.462
I'd love a quesadilla.
Can I have a quesadilla?

01:07:28.546 --> 01:07:29.714
Really?

01:07:29.797 --> 01:07:31.590
I don't think it matters.

01:07:31.716 --> 01:07:33.676
You'll know if I need you.
It doesn't matter.

01:07:36.137 --> 01:07:37.805
Tranquilizer.

01:07:54.864 --> 01:07:56.115
Can I help you?

01:07:57.158 --> 01:07:58.284
My name's Carl.

01:07:59.744 --> 01:08:02.246
Uh, I know you don't
remember me, Josh.

01:08:02.329 --> 01:08:05.374
Elise and I did our best
to make sure of that.

01:08:05.458 --> 01:08:07.334
You're right,
I don't remember you.

01:08:08.169 --> 01:08:11.630
Your mother called me when you
started experiencing some problems

01:08:11.714 --> 01:08:16.385
<i>and what I saw scared me so badly
that I, uh, reached out to Elise.</i>

01:08:17.261 --> 01:08:19.013
Now Elise is gone.

01:08:19.471 --> 01:08:22.933
I was wondering if you could
help give me some closure.

01:08:24.852 --> 01:08:26.145
Ineedit

01:08:28.647 --> 01:08:29.689
Sure.

01:08:32.693 --> 01:08:33.736
Okay.

01:08:38.532 --> 01:08:39.575
Phew!

01:08:39.658 --> 01:08:41.368
This is pretty exciting.

01:08:41.452 --> 01:08:43.412
I feel like an FBI agent.

01:08:54.715 --> 01:08:58.093
Tell me what you're thinking.
Lorraine, what do you know?

01:08:58.176 --> 01:09:01.930
I think that when Josh went
into that other world,

01:09:02.932 --> 01:09:04.558
something else came back.

01:09:05.434 --> 01:09:08.687
We believe it's a
spirit that's killed

01:09:08.770 --> 01:09:11.064
many times before,
and it'll kill again.

01:09:11.148 --> 01:09:14.109
That's why I had to get you
and the kids away from him.

01:09:14.193 --> 01:09:17.154
Last night, when I
looked into his eyes,

01:09:17.238 --> 01:09:20.282
like I have every day
for the last 12 years,

01:09:20.366 --> 01:09:23.077
was the first time
I didn't recognize him.

01:09:24.370 --> 01:09:25.787
I was scared of him.

01:09:25.871 --> 01:09:27.122
Right now, at the house,

01:09:27.206 --> 01:09:31.167
there is an acquaintance of Elise's
and mine, and he's talking to Josh.

01:09:31.252 --> 01:09:33.921
We're going to try to sedate
him and when he's under,

01:09:34.004 --> 01:09:36.966
we're going to try to reach
out to the real Josh.

01:09:37.049 --> 01:09:38.968
And what if we can't find him?

01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:46.140
Are you feeling okay?

01:09:47.393 --> 01:09:48.769
I'm fine.

01:09:49.435 --> 01:09:51.316
Just woke up feeling
a little under the weather.

01:09:52.731 --> 01:09:54.984
Isuppose I wanted to ask you

01:09:55.067 --> 01:09:58.028
if you've any idea
what happened to Elise.

01:09:58.112 --> 01:09:59.864
No, I don't.

01:10:02.199 --> 01:10:03.284
Look, I...

01:10:04.368 --> 01:10:07.329
I should remind you that, um...

01:10:07.413 --> 01:10:09.623
I'm not the person who's
gonna look at you funny

01:10:09.707 --> 01:10:12.543
if you tell me
something unusual.

01:10:12.626 --> 01:10:13.627
Mmm-hmm.

01:10:13.752 --> 01:10:16.338
I've seen things
with my own eyes

01:10:17.131 --> 01:10:20.175
that most people have to
go to sleep to conjure up.

01:10:21.510 --> 01:10:24.972
Elise sent me to a place
that still haunts my dreams.

01:10:26.891 --> 01:10:28.851
But I got my son back.

01:10:32.813 --> 01:10:35.608
I don't know, I left the
room for about 10 minutes,

01:10:35.691 --> 01:10:38.611
and when I came back,
Elise was dead.

01:10:40.195 --> 01:10:41.697
She had been strangled.

01:10:45.534 --> 01:10:47.244
That's pretty horrific.

01:10:50.831 --> 01:10:51.832
I guess.

01:10:52.249 --> 01:10:53.250
Oh!

01:10:54.335 --> 01:10:55.336
Um...

01:10:56.670 --> 01:10:59.048
When you were a boy,

01:10:59.131 --> 01:11:02.092
you said it was an old
woman who haunted you.

01:11:02.968 --> 01:11:05.095
Did you see that same old woman

01:11:05.179 --> 01:11:06.680
when you were in
that other world?

01:11:07.973 --> 01:11:09.224
No.

01:11:12.269 --> 01:11:13.562
Okay. Um...

01:11:20.027 --> 01:11:22.571
Say, would you like a drink?

01:11:24.990 --> 01:11:26.867
Water. A glass of
water would be nice.

01:11:27.701 --> 01:11:28.702
Sure.

01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:55.562
What you got there?

01:11:56.855 --> 01:11:58.524
Huh? Oh. Uh...

01:11:58.691 --> 01:11:59.733
Nothing.

01:11:59.858 --> 01:12:02.236
I thought maybe you were
playing with your dice.

01:12:03.904 --> 01:12:05.197
Excuse me?

01:12:05.447 --> 01:12:08.075
Mother tells me you
like to play with dice.

01:12:08.742 --> 01:12:12.871
Did she? I didn't realize you
guys had spoken this morning.

01:12:15.290 --> 01:12:16.542
It's how I do my readings.

01:12:16.709 --> 01:12:17.710
Ah.

01:12:22.715 --> 01:12:24.076
What have you got
behind your back?

01:12:27.886 --> 01:12:31.765
Why don't you ask your dice
what I have behind my back?

01:12:34.768 --> 01:12:37.438
Come on, roll them and see.

01:12:39.898 --> 01:12:42.735
Mother tells me you were very
good with them at the house.

01:12:46.447 --> 01:12:48.699
Come on, it'll be fun.

01:12:57.458 --> 01:12:58.459
What...

01:12:58.542 --> 01:12:59.918
What does Josh...

01:13:04.256 --> 01:13:09.136
What is Parker Crane
holding behind his back?

01:13:19.313 --> 01:13:20.481
She was always right.

01:13:23.275 --> 01:13:24.359
Shit!

01:13:30.491 --> 01:13:31.492
Ah!

01:13:32.618 --> 01:13:34.161
Come on!

01:13:49.802 --> 01:13:51.053
Quesadilla.

01:13:55.516 --> 01:13:57.059
- Carl!
- In here!

01:13:57.768 --> 01:13:58.769
I got you!

01:14:46.692 --> 01:14:49.069
<i>I know you, don't I?</i>

01:14:50.904 --> 01:14:54.366
<i>Well, if you're here, I guess I
don't have to ask where I am.</i>

01:15:00.164 --> 01:15:01.915
<i>He killed you.</i>

01:15:03.917 --> 01:15:05.794
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

01:15:05.878 --> 01:15:08.630
<i>That thing is gonna murder my
family if I don't get back.</i>

01:15:08.714 --> 01:15:11.049
<i>I am trapped here.
I'm getting weaker</i>

01:15:11.133 --> 01:15:13.427
<i>the longer I'm away
from my body.</i>

01:15:18.765 --> 01:15:20.267
<i>Elise.</i>

01:15:20.976 --> 01:15:22.686
<i>Elise, she's not here.</i>

01:15:23.687 --> 01:15:25.647
<i>Well, then we'll
have to find her.</i>

01:15:35.199 --> 01:15:37.284
<i>Into the Further we go.</i>

01:15:44.708 --> 01:15:48.337
<i>You need to kill the others.</i>

01:15:48.420 --> 01:15:51.840
<i>It's the only
way to stay alive.</i>

01:15:52.174 --> 01:15:54.676
Shut up! Shut up!
Get out of my head!

01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:56.386
Shutup!
Get outta here!

01:15:56.470 --> 01:15:58.096
Get out of my head!

01:16:10.442 --> 01:16:13.904
Okay, I've just got a message from Tucker.
He says they're ready.

01:16:20.035 --> 01:16:21.370
<i>JOSH". Elise?</i>

01:16:26.583 --> 01:16:27.626
<i>Elise!</i>

01:16:32.339 --> 01:16:34.258
<i>Don't do that.</i>

01:16:43.558 --> 01:16:45.394
<i>What is it?</i>

01:16:45.477 --> 01:16:47.521
<i>There's someone
standing in front of you.</i>

01:16:51.149 --> 01:16:52.651
<i>I don't see anybody.</i>

01:16:52.734 --> 01:16:54.861
<i>He's right in front of you!</i>

01:16:56.697 --> 01:16:57.698
<i>He's...</i>

01:16:57.781 --> 01:16:59.157
<i>He's talking to you.</i>

01:17:01.159 --> 01:17:02.452
<i>What's he saying?</i>

01:17:02.536 --> 01:17:03.787
<i>CARL".
"He's got your baby."</i>

01:17:03.870 --> 01:17:07.374
<i>"He's got your baby. He's got your baby.
He's got your baby."</i>

01:17:07.541 --> 01:17:10.043
<i>He's got your baby.
He's got your baby.</i>

01:17:13.338 --> 01:17:14.715
<i>What's he doing now?</i>

01:17:15.048 --> 01:17:16.091
<i>He...</i>

01:17:16.174 --> 01:17:18.343
<i>He's pointing at something.</i>

01:17:23.307 --> 01:17:24.850
<i>Over there.</i>

01:17:36.570 --> 01:17:39.614
<i>I heard this noise coming from Kali's room.
It was on the baby monitor.</i>

01:17:39.698 --> 01:17:40.779
<i>Probably just interference.</i>

01:17:40.824 --> 01:17:41.825
<i>. I don't know.</i>

01:17:41.908 --> 01:17:46.204
It sounded so clear. It was
like this whispering. It was...

01:17:46.288 --> 01:17:47.914
Scared the hell out of me.

01:17:48.874 --> 01:17:51.960
<i>Then I went to hear the
monitor and turned up the volume</i>

01:17:52.044 --> 01:17:53.337
<i>and heard a man's voice.</i>

01:17:53.420 --> 01:17:56.715
<i>I ran up there
and I looked inside.</i>

01:17:59.926 --> 01:18:03.305
<i>Probably just some noise.
Those things always pick up...</i>

01:18:08.643 --> 01:18:11.688
<i>No! No! No.</i>

01:18:12.689 --> 01:18:14.316
<i>No! Hey!</i>

01:18:18.737 --> 01:18:19.905
Who the hell is that?

01:18:23.825 --> 01:18:24.951
Hold on.

01:18:26.244 --> 01:18:27.496
Stay here.

01:18:27.788 --> 01:18:29.373
<i>Renai!</i>

01:18:57.818 --> 01:18:59.319
Hello?

01:19:07.536 --> 01:19:09.037
<i>No. Josh, no!</i>

01:19:24.511 --> 01:19:27.222
Josh! Josh! Quick! There's someone in here!
Someone in the curtains!

01:19:29.266 --> 01:19:30.267
<i>CARL'. Josh! Josh!</i>

01:19:30.350 --> 01:19:31.351
<i>Renai!</i>

01:19:36.148 --> 01:19:37.482
<i>Renai!</i>

01:19:43.196 --> 01:19:45.282
<i>Get away from her!</i>

01:19:45.365 --> 01:19:47.367
<i>Get away from her!</i>

01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:53.498
<i>ELSE'. Go to hell!</i>

01:20:15.353 --> 01:20:16.521
Josh.

01:20:21.526 --> 01:20:24.362
<i>I wish I could say
it's good to see you.</i>

01:20:27.657 --> 01:20:29.242
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

01:20:30.577 --> 01:20:31.745
<i>You shouldn't be here.</i>

01:20:32.496 --> 01:20:34.956
<i>We all pass through
this place eventually.</i>

01:20:35.290 --> 01:20:37.792
<i>Hopefully, on our way
to someplace better.</i>

01:20:38.585 --> 01:20:40.378
<i>I've seen that better place,</i>

01:20:40.795 --> 01:20:43.381
<i>but I came back here
because I heard you calling,</i>

01:20:43.757 --> 01:20:45.091
<i>and I think I can help.</i>

01:20:48.261 --> 01:20:50.180
<i>Carl, what are you doing here?</i>

01:20:50.263 --> 01:20:52.807
<i>You are not
supposed to be here.</i>

01:20:52.891 --> 01:20:54.601
<i>I failed you, Elise.</i>

01:20:54.976 --> 01:20:56.061
<i>Oh...</i>

01:20:56.353 --> 01:20:59.981
<i>No, you didn't.
No, you didn't.</i>

01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:03.443
<i>You were looking for Josh
and you found him.</i>

01:21:04.945 --> 01:21:07.322
<i>Josh, you don't belong here,</i>

01:21:07.405 --> 01:21:09.824
<i>and neither does that entity
belong in your world.</i>

01:21:09.908 --> 01:21:11.201
<i>I don't know how to fight her.</i>

01:21:11.284 --> 01:21:13.036
<i>Out there in the darkness,</i>

01:21:13.119 --> 01:21:17.541
<i>she has a home where all her
memories live from her life.</i>

01:21:17.624 --> 01:21:20.335
<i>Use those memories to draw
her out of your vessel</i>

01:21:20.418 --> 01:21:22.379
<i>so that you can get
back into your body.</i>

01:21:22.963 --> 01:21:24.506
<i>But where do I find her home?</i>

01:21:24.839 --> 01:21:26.591
<i>Only you know where that is.</i>

01:21:28.677 --> 01:21:30.053
<i>I don't remember.</i>

01:21:31.972 --> 01:21:34.349
<i>Maybe we're asking
the wrong Josh.</i>

01:21:40.647 --> 01:21:41.815
What happened?

01:21:41.898 --> 01:21:45.151
I saw what haunts him, and it's not a friend.
It's a parasite.

01:21:45.485 --> 01:21:48.029
I've never felt such
a malignant presence.

01:21:48.113 --> 01:21:50.073
<i>It wants to be him.</i>

01:21:50.156 --> 01:21:55.120
<i>Miss Lambert, I think your son
has a unique ability, a gift.</i>

01:22:02.127 --> 01:22:03.420
<i>Josh.</i>

01:22:04.963 --> 01:22:06.631
<i>I need your help.</i>

01:22:07.465 --> 01:22:10.969
<i>I don't have any memories
of the old woman anymore,</i>

01:22:11.052 --> 01:22:12.887
<i>but you do.</i>

01:22:13.805 --> 01:22:15.890
<i>I need to know where she lives.</i>

01:22:25.650 --> 01:22:26.860
<i>I'll show you.</i>

01:23:04.147 --> 01:23:06.775
<i>So that's what that was about.</i>

01:23:34.719 --> 01:23:36.096
Carl?

01:23:46.690 --> 01:23:48.233
Josh?

01:23:50.610 --> 01:23:52.195
Josh?

01:23:54.906 --> 01:23:56.908
Hi, honey.

01:23:57.909 --> 01:24:01.204
I'm waiting for the boys.
They're not home yet.

01:24:01.454 --> 01:24:03.790
Did my friend
Carl stop by today?

01:24:05.959 --> 01:24:07.836
No, I don't think so.

01:24:24.477 --> 01:24:25.937
You did this to yourselves!

01:24:36.406 --> 01:24:38.742
It's been so long
since I felt real pain.

01:24:38.825 --> 01:24:40.493
Renai, help me!

01:24:43.663 --> 01:24:47.500
I missed it, but not as much as
I miss inflicting it on others.

01:25:06.644 --> 01:25:08.480
Renai, get out
of here! Run!

01:25:12.025 --> 01:25:13.359
I'll come back for you, Mommy!

01:25:33.296 --> 01:25:35.256
- Okay, guys, we're here.
- Yay!

01:25:35.340 --> 01:25:36.341
Thanks, Jessica.

01:25:36.382 --> 01:25:37.943
Thank you. No problem.
See you tomorrow.

01:25:38.009 --> 01:25:39.302
Let's go, Foster.

01:25:41.179 --> 01:25:42.680
I didn't want this, RenaL

01:25:43.890 --> 01:25:47.101
She wanted me to kill
you, but I said no.

01:25:47.852 --> 01:25:51.064
But now, I know she was right.

01:26:02.075 --> 01:26:05.578
You are a miserable,
ungrateful bitch.

01:26:05.662 --> 01:26:07.956
You have no idea
how much you've wasted

01:26:08.039 --> 01:26:09.499
your life being
afraid of the dead,

01:26:09.582 --> 01:26:12.544
because pretty soon, you're
going to be one of them.

01:26:13.878 --> 01:26:16.965
Then, when I take you
to my home in the dark,

01:26:17.423 --> 01:26:20.134
you'll realize how happy
you should've been

01:26:20.218 --> 01:26:23.096
for your brief,
little moment in the sun.

01:26:42.448 --> 01:26:43.700
Mommy! Mommy!

01:26:44.450 --> 01:26:45.535
Daddy! No!

01:26:54.794 --> 01:26:56.296
Come on!

01:28:38.564 --> 01:28:39.732
<i>Hello?</i>

01:28:45.863 --> 01:28:47.782
<i>My name is Parker!</i>

01:28:47.865 --> 01:28:49.367
<i>What is this?</i>

01:28:50.243 --> 01:28:52.537
<i>Did you do this?</i>

01:28:56.040 --> 01:28:57.625
<i>Don't you dare!</i>

01:29:00.753 --> 01:29:02.046
<i>But, Mommy...</i>

01:29:05.216 --> 01:29:06.801
<i>Speak the truth.</i>

01:29:08.928 --> 01:29:10.179
<i>Did you?</i>

01:29:12.724 --> 01:29:15.560
<i>Yes.
That is not your name!</i>

01:29:16.352 --> 01:29:19.689
<i>Parker is not your name!</i>

01:29:19.897 --> 01:29:23.109
<i>That is the name
your father gave you!</i>

01:29:23.317 --> 01:29:25.445
<i>Your name</i>

01:29:26.487 --> 01:29:28.114
<i>is Marilyn.</i>

01:29:29.198 --> 01:29:31.117
<i>Do you understand?</i>

01:29:33.077 --> 01:29:34.954
<i>Repeat after me.</i>

01:29:36.414 --> 01:29:39.500
<i>"My name is Marilyn."</i>

01:29:41.794 --> 01:29:43.880
<i>Say m</i>

01:29:43.963 --> 01:29:45.673
<i>My name is...</i>

01:29:47.091 --> 01:29:48.468
<i>Marilyn.</i>

01:29:52.638 --> 01:29:53.681
<i>Quiet, now.</i>

01:29:54.307 --> 01:29:59.729
<i>If you don't be a good
little girl, you'll get...</i>

01:30:17.997 --> 01:30:20.416
Mommy, Mommy, I can go
into the dark place

01:30:20.500 --> 01:30:22.085
and find Daddy,
if I go to sleep.

01:30:22.168 --> 01:30:23.669
No, it's too dangerous.

01:30:23.753 --> 01:30:25.088
I nearly lost you once before.

01:30:25.171 --> 01:30:26.464
I'm not gonna let
that happen again.

01:30:26.547 --> 01:30:30.009
Loan find him. I promise I'll find him.
I promise.

01:30:30.843 --> 01:30:31.886
I will.

01:30:39.060 --> 01:30:40.353
Turn around.

01:30:50.863 --> 01:30:52.532
It's okay!

01:30:54.826 --> 01:30:55.868
Be careful.

01:30:58.955 --> 01:31:00.206
I love you.

01:31:38.619 --> 01:31:41.205
<i>Destroy her, Josh!
End this!</i>

01:31:46.043 --> 01:31:47.712
Where am <i>I?</i>

01:33:15.132 --> 01:33:16.259
Let her go!

01:33:16.342 --> 01:33:17.343
Lorraine?

01:33:22.556 --> 01:33:23.683
Where is he?
He...

01:33:23.766 --> 01:33:24.850
He's got Renai.

01:33:34.777 --> 01:33:35.778
What the hell!

01:34:11.647 --> 01:34:14.734
<i>Parker, help me destroy
the memories of her.</i>

01:34:15.151 --> 01:34:16.736
<i>It will set you free.</i>

01:34:16.819 --> 01:34:19.030
<i>Please let me in.</i>

01:34:19.238 --> 01:34:20.990
<i>Open the door.</i>

01:34:39.925 --> 01:34:43.179
<i>Little girls need
to learn to be good!</i>

01:35:03.324 --> 01:35:04.950
No!

01:35:24.804 --> 01:35:25.805
Baby!

01:35:26.305 --> 01:35:27.473
Hey!

01:35:27.765 --> 01:35:29.392
Hey, come back!
Come back!

01:35:33.896 --> 01:35:34.897
<i>Elise!</i>

01:35:34.980 --> 01:35:36.315
<i>Josh, go now.</i>

01:35:36.399 --> 01:35:37.817
<i>I wish I could
take you with me.</i>

01:35:37.900 --> 01:35:39.652
<i>I can't.
But you can take Carl.</i>

01:35:39.735 --> 01:35:40.778
<i>What?</i>

01:35:40.986 --> 01:35:42.655
<i>I told you,
you don't belong here.</i>

01:35:42.738 --> 01:35:44.448
<i>I felt your heartbeat
when I hugged you.</i>

01:35:44.532 --> 01:35:47.076
<i>You're still alive.
It's time to live again.</i>

01:35:47.159 --> 01:35:48.744
<i>But you both have to go now!</i>

01:35:49.286 --> 01:35:51.288
<i>Go now!</i>

01:35:51.372 --> 01:35:53.040
Go!

01:36:19.316 --> 01:36:20.484
<i>Get away!</i>

01:36:24.321 --> 01:36:26.740
<i>Get back! Get back!</i>

01:36:27.533 --> 01:36:29.160
<i>DALTON". Daddy!</i>

01:36:29.827 --> 01:36:31.454
Dalton?

01:36:33.664 --> 01:36:34.832
<i>Dalton!</i>

01:36:34.915 --> 01:36:36.041
<i>DALTON". Daddy!</i>

01:36:38.002 --> 01:36:39.044
<i>Where are you, son?</i>

01:36:39.128 --> 01:36:40.504
<i>Daddy!</i>

01:36:41.380 --> 01:36:42.381
<i>Oh!</i>

01:36:42.756 --> 01:36:45.634
<i>Oh, good boy!
What are you doing here?</i>

01:36:45.718 --> 01:36:47.970
<i>I came to bring you home!</i>

01:36:49.054 --> 01:36:50.139
<i>How did you find me?</i>

01:36:50.222 --> 01:36:51.932
<i>I followed your steps.</i>

01:36:52.016 --> 01:36:54.018
<i>RENAY. Please wake up!</i>

01:36:55.186 --> 01:36:57.188
Where are you?
Come back, come on!

01:36:58.355 --> 01:36:59.523
<i>Come back to me.</i>

01:36:59.607 --> 01:37:00.774
<i>That's Mommy.</i>

01:37:00.858 --> 01:37:02.651
<i>Wake up!</i>

01:37:03.694 --> 01:37:05.237
<i>Get back to me!</i>

01:37:06.030 --> 01:37:08.073
<i>Clever boy.
Follow me.</i>

01:37:10.242 --> 01:37:11.494
Wake up.

01:37:11.577 --> 01:37:13.662
Come on, wake up!

01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:42.566
It's me.

01:37:43.776 --> 01:37:45.736
Renai, it's me, it's okay.

01:37:46.654 --> 01:37:47.947
It's okay.

01:37:48.364 --> 01:37:49.949
Daddy?

01:37:50.491 --> 01:37:51.534
Yeah.

01:37:52.409 --> 01:37:53.494
Daddy, you're back!

01:37:53.577 --> 01:37:54.620
Yeah.

01:37:55.496 --> 01:37:57.122
Thanks to you.

01:38:00.167 --> 01:38:01.961
My boys. Hey, buddy.

01:38:07.925 --> 01:38:09.885
Renai, it's me, it's okay.

01:38:13.681 --> 01:38:15.975
I tried reaching you. I tried everything.

01:38:16.976 --> 01:38:18.310
I played your song.

01:38:29.321 --> 01:38:31.490
I should've known it was you.

01:38:32.783 --> 01:38:35.369
Only you could
play it that badly.

01:38:36.245 --> 01:38:37.538
<i>(BOTH LAUGH';</i>

01:38:53.178 --> 01:38:54.638
Bring it!

01:39:03.731 --> 01:39:04.857
Are you ready?

01:39:05.232 --> 01:39:06.859
We're ready.

01:39:07.735 --> 01:39:10.487
Ready to forget
once and for all.

01:39:10.571 --> 01:39:12.531
No more traveling, right?

01:39:13.240 --> 01:39:16.076
This is the only
world we wanna be in.

01:39:16.160 --> 01:39:17.953
Good, Mr. Lambert.

01:39:18.037 --> 01:39:20.748
So then, close your eyes.

01:39:22.833 --> 01:39:23.917
Both of you.

01:39:25.169 --> 01:39:27.129
Now take a deep breath,

01:39:28.380 --> 01:39:30.507
and just listen to the ticking.

01:39:30.591 --> 01:39:34.970
Now feel yourselves getting
sleepier and sleepier,

01:39:35.054 --> 01:39:39.600
and let the darkness
drift further

01:39:39.683 --> 01:39:42.853
and further away.

01:40:11.256 --> 01:40:13.884
Who is it? I
have a message for you.

01:40:13.967 --> 01:40:15.386
It's about Allison.

01:40:19.556 --> 01:40:21.141
Is this some kind of joke?

01:40:21.225 --> 01:40:24.436
We have a close personal
friend who has, uh,

01:40:24.520 --> 01:40:26.271
spoken with Allison.

01:40:26.397 --> 01:40:27.439
That's not possible.

01:40:27.523 --> 01:40:29.364
You better leave now
or I'm calling the police.

01:40:29.441 --> 01:40:31.276
Wait, Brian.

01:40:32.945 --> 01:40:34.029
Who are you guys?

01:40:34.113 --> 01:40:36.699
Uh... We help
people, ma'am.

01:40:38.075 --> 01:40:41.120
People who've been afflicted by...
Who's the lady?

01:40:43.080 --> 01:40:44.540
What lady, honey?

01:40:44.623 --> 01:40:46.125
The lady standing behind them.

01:40:51.004 --> 01:40:52.005
Um...

01:40:52.631 --> 01:40:54.967
Our friend told us to tell you

01:40:55.050 --> 01:40:57.511
that Allison's
accident was no accident.

01:40:57.594 --> 01:41:01.265
When she was resuscitated
back to life at the hospital,

01:41:01.348 --> 01:41:02.975
she brought something
back with her.

01:41:03.100 --> 01:41:05.394
Not just one
thing, many things.

01:41:05.477 --> 01:41:08.313
And they're living here
in this house with you.

01:41:10.774 --> 01:41:12.359
Allison.

01:41:16.405 --> 01:41:18.323
Allison.

01:41:39.303 --> 01:41:41.638
Oh, my God!
