WEBVTT

00:17.642 --> 00:20.186
The government is nervous
about this war.

00:20.270 --> 00:21.604
It's our job to stop this shit.

00:23.606 --> 00:26.693
Arturo has volunteered to negotiate
peace with Chente and Cano.

00:27.694 --> 00:29.029
Hell no, Arturo.

00:29.738 --> 00:31.656
Chente and I learned
the business together.

00:33.450 --> 00:35.869
I said he'd have to be alone and unarmed,
and he accepted.

00:36.703 --> 00:38.705
You'll return in a box, dumbass.

00:39.956 --> 00:41.624
They'll fuck him up.

00:43.877 --> 00:45.295
I trust him.

00:53.511 --> 00:54.888
We are in your hands.

00:55.430 --> 00:56.765
To his courage!

00:57.557 --> 00:59.184
To his courage!

01:03.354 --> 01:05.023
It'll take care of you.

01:07.650 --> 01:10.612
Few have the balls to enter Juarez
with this war going on.

01:12.155 --> 01:13.573
Thank you, Joaquín.

01:14.741 --> 01:17.577
I'll make sure you end up dancing
with Chente and Cano.

01:20.121 --> 01:21.331
I hope so.

01:29.714 --> 01:31.341
Did El Chapo force you to go?

01:31.925 --> 01:33.051
No.

01:33.843 --> 01:35.637
-For real, Arturo?
-For real.

01:37.180 --> 01:39.182
<i>-I'll go with you. I'll take hitmen.</i>
<i>-No.</i>

01:39.265 --> 01:41.726
I have to keep my word with Chente.

01:41.810 --> 01:45.438
If I get this for Joaquín, we'll have
more power within the Federation.

01:45.897 --> 01:47.315
And if you don't succeed?

02:00.120 --> 02:04.582
<i>I feel the warmth</i>
<i>from my boiling blood</i>

02:04.666 --> 02:08.795
<i>I feel the fear,</i>
<i>sweat dripping away</i>

02:08.920 --> 02:12.882
<i>There's a stillness</i>
<i>that nothing transmits</i>

02:13.550 --> 02:19.722
<i>I'm a breeze that grows stronger</i>

02:19.931 --> 02:23.059
<i>Even when the clouds drift away</i>

02:24.185 --> 02:27.814
<i>Even when my skin dries away</i>

02:28.565 --> 02:32.110
<i>I'll be back someday</i>

02:33.111 --> 02:37.240
<i>To unleash my return</i>

02:41.786 --> 02:45.707
<i>I have the dust that protects the road</i>

02:45.957 --> 02:50.086
<i>I have the branches of a leafless tree</i>

02:50.795 --> 02:54.757
<i>I'm the guardian of the tired night</i>

02:54.966 --> 03:01.014
<i>There are silhouettes that</i>
<i>come to meet me</i>

03:01.639 --> 03:05.894
<i>Even when the clouds drift away</i>

03:05.977 --> 03:08.938
<i>Even when my skin dries away</i>

03:09.981 --> 03:13.651
<i>I'll be back someday</i>

03:14.777 --> 03:18.656
<i>To unleash my return</i>

03:21.075 --> 03:22.368
No, Mr. President.

03:24.078 --> 03:24.954
SECRETARY OF PUBLIC EDUCATION
MEXICO CITY

03:25.038 --> 03:28.124
By anticipating that situation, last week
we confiscated two semis from Sinaloa.

03:28.207 --> 03:30.251
NARCOBANNER IMPLICATES SECRETARY OF
PUBLIC SAFETY WITH SINALOA CARTEL

03:34.923 --> 03:36.799
The public opinion, yes, I know.

03:40.762 --> 03:44.098
I'll manage the problem,
and I'll keep you informed.

03:49.145 --> 03:51.064
CONRADO SOL, IF YOU WANT
TO STOP THE COUNTRY'S INSECURITY,

03:51.189 --> 03:52.690
STOP PROTECTING CHAPO AND SINALOA

04:05.578 --> 04:09.749
I'm sorry, but the shipment to Guatemala
will be stopped until things calm down.

04:09.916 --> 04:13.336
<i>Also, I'm going to confiscate something</i>
<i>of yours in Culiacan, Guadalajara,</i>

04:13.628 --> 04:16.172
<i>Nogales, and Nayarit.</i>

04:16.381 --> 04:18.132
You're hitting me hard, Conrado.

04:18.216 --> 04:19.842
Not as hard as that Narco banner hit me.

04:20.343 --> 04:21.552
<i>I assume you saw it.</i>

04:22.804 --> 04:24.973
I told you I'm about to sort things out.

04:25.723 --> 04:28.518
You leave me no choice,
until you sort it out.

04:30.770 --> 04:33.064
The press is all over Conrado,

04:34.274 --> 04:35.692
and now he has to fuck us up.

04:35.817 --> 04:37.151
Let him make a show.

04:37.860 --> 04:40.697
He will have to make up for our losses.

04:42.240 --> 04:44.617
ROAD TO HIDALGO DEL PARRAL

04:50.415 --> 04:51.416
What's up, Joaquín?

04:51.499 --> 04:53.543
Arturo, how are you doing?

04:54.085 --> 04:55.628
<i>It's all good, Joaquín.</i>

04:56.296 --> 04:58.381
<i>I'm on my way to Parral.</i>
<i>I'll see you later.</i>

04:58.548 --> 04:59.674
Take care, fucker.

05:00.591 --> 05:01.801
<i>We'll be in touch.</i>

05:03.386 --> 05:04.721
OK.

05:05.930 --> 05:06.889
Thanks.

05:52.060 --> 05:54.187
Arturo arrived.

06:01.235 --> 06:02.487
Where's Chente?

06:04.155 --> 06:05.782
He's waiting for you in Juarez.

06:09.327 --> 06:10.870
Let's go...

07:10.430 --> 07:13.933
OUTSIDE JUAREZ VICINITY

07:59.270 --> 08:01.147
Fucking Arturo.

08:02.356 --> 08:04.108
My brothers were right.

08:04.984 --> 08:06.819
I'll admit you have balls, fucker.

08:14.827 --> 08:16.996
-Did they treat you well?
-Yes.

08:17.121 --> 08:19.290
You should train your pilots better.

08:19.457 --> 08:21.459
I almost threw up.

08:22.668 --> 08:25.004
I told them to kill you
if you looked suspicious to them.

08:25.463 --> 08:28.883
You were lucky because
sometimes they are wrong.

08:29.050 --> 08:30.468
This time they were right.

08:31.260 --> 08:32.803
Because I came to talk about peace.

08:34.472 --> 08:35.806
I didn't start this war.

08:37.934 --> 08:40.520
-El Chapo started it.
-Yes, but we are all fighting.

08:41.938 --> 08:43.981
And if you were willing,
we could stop it right now.

08:44.065 --> 08:45.733
El Chapo betrayed me once.

08:46.359 --> 08:48.402
And he won't fool me again.

08:49.695 --> 08:51.489
We all want peace,

08:51.572 --> 08:52.907
not just Joaquín.

08:57.954 --> 09:00.414
I wouldn't have risked my neck
if this wasn't serious.

09:01.916 --> 09:03.876
Look, I can't decide without Cano,

09:04.585 --> 09:07.713
and he won't accept it.

09:07.797 --> 09:09.549
If it was up to him, you'd be dead now.

09:12.927 --> 09:14.804
Convince him to talk to me, Chente.

09:15.721 --> 09:17.390
It's not good for any of us
to continue like this.

09:18.182 --> 09:19.016
Look...

09:20.601 --> 09:22.562
I'm not asking you
to return to the Federation.

09:22.979 --> 09:25.439
We'll all run our own business,
working peacefully.

09:28.526 --> 09:30.528
Well, it's your turn
to wait for an answer.

09:32.572 --> 09:33.573
OK.

09:35.449 --> 09:37.368
Just give me protection,
and I'll stay in Juarez

09:37.451 --> 09:39.036
waiting for your decision.

09:46.794 --> 09:48.879
I hope Cano doesn't decide to kill you.

09:56.887 --> 09:57.847
Move quickly!

10:14.530 --> 10:15.823
Here's your money.

10:18.034 --> 10:19.577
Straight to Chicago with no delays.

10:19.702 --> 10:21.078
-You coming with us?
-I don't have time.

10:21.162 --> 10:23.873
-Is it 30 million?
-Why 30? It's always been 25.

10:23.998 --> 10:26.000
No, dude, the price increased.

10:26.083 --> 10:28.085
To make it to 30
I have to launder it twice,

10:28.169 --> 10:29.253
and the powder will lose quality.

10:29.337 --> 10:31.422
If you don't want it, tell me,
and I'll call my dad.

10:31.714 --> 10:34.425
There's plenty of others
who want to do business with us.

10:47.938 --> 10:50.441
<i>Slow down, Quino!</i>

10:52.902 --> 10:54.111
Catch me if you can!

11:41.742 --> 11:42.701
We have to search for him.

11:44.036 --> 11:44.995
Give him a chance.

11:45.413 --> 11:46.956
If he was dead,
we would have known by now.

11:48.416 --> 11:49.333
Joaquín is right.

11:50.167 --> 11:51.877
Bad news travel fast,

11:53.170 --> 11:54.964
especially regarding Cano.

11:56.132 --> 11:57.216
We have to wait.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.201
The boss wants to talk with you.

12:31.876 --> 12:32.793
<i>What's up, Chente?</i>

12:33.502 --> 12:35.004
Cano doesn't want to meet you.

12:36.547 --> 12:38.048
<i>You'll have to leave Juarez.</i>

12:40.092 --> 12:42.052
We could do something better than waiting.

12:42.678 --> 12:45.306
Cano's cousin is a boy who wanders
on the streets of Torreon.

12:47.391 --> 12:48.726
I sent my people to follow him.

12:49.435 --> 12:51.145
They're just waiting for my signal.

12:51.228 --> 12:52.813
Leave the boy alone, Arriero.

12:54.106 --> 12:55.900
It's just life insurance for Arturo.

12:58.319 --> 13:00.154
You know what it is to lose a brother.

13:02.239 --> 13:03.574
Don't make me beg you.

13:11.790 --> 13:14.126
JR, change of plans.
Do not leave Arturo.

13:16.378 --> 13:19.256
-Should we come back?
<i>-No, take him to Nuevo Laredo.</i>

13:19.381 --> 13:20.674
<i>Cano will take care of him.</i>

13:20.925 --> 13:21.926
Wait, wait!

13:22.301 --> 13:24.303
You motherfuckers!

14:12.184 --> 14:13.894
Where the fuck is my cousin?

14:18.023 --> 14:19.984
I don't know anything about him.

14:20.067 --> 14:21.861
If you had balls, as Chente says,

14:22.820 --> 14:24.405
you wouldn't have picked him up.

14:25.531 --> 14:27.783
This is the last bullshit
you do in this life.

14:29.410 --> 14:30.661
No, no! Wait, wait!

14:31.120 --> 14:32.580
If you kill me, they'll kill your cousin.

14:32.872 --> 14:34.540
Let me find out where he is.

14:38.752 --> 14:40.254
You're one of El Chapo's men.

14:41.422 --> 14:43.048
You're probably treacherous, too.

14:43.632 --> 14:46.135
I come on behalf of the Federation,
not just Joaquín.

14:46.886 --> 14:49.221
And I'm a man of word. Chente knows it.

14:50.347 --> 14:52.474
I came alone and unarmed to talk peace.

14:53.767 --> 14:56.312
Let me call Culiacan
to find out about your cousin.

15:00.399 --> 15:01.442
You have one minute.

15:17.041 --> 15:18.667
-Yes?
-It's Arturo.

15:19.043 --> 15:20.169
Cano is asking about his cousin.

15:20.920 --> 15:24.214
The boy is OK. When you return
in one piece, I'll let him go.

15:25.674 --> 15:27.426
What the fuck were you thinking, idiot?

15:28.052 --> 15:29.219
Release him right now.

15:29.345 --> 15:30.721
<i>Do they guarantee you'll return alive?</i>

15:31.180 --> 15:33.641
That's my problem. Release him, brother.

15:35.476 --> 15:37.269
They'll find him in Torreon Plaza.

15:48.697 --> 15:50.491
I already sent men to the plaza, sir.

15:52.618 --> 15:56.830
If you would lead the Federation,
I'd join them.

15:58.082 --> 15:59.667
The Federation has its leader.

16:00.668 --> 16:02.920
I'm here because Joaquín
is offering you peace.

16:03.212 --> 16:05.005
I don't believe any shit
coming from that fucker.

16:05.297 --> 16:09.134
We defended ourselves against everyone.
Against you, the Army,

16:09.218 --> 16:11.220
the federal police,
and we remained untouched.

16:12.137 --> 16:13.597
That dude is nervous.

16:16.350 --> 16:17.226
No deal.

16:18.268 --> 16:21.271
That fucker would betray his own mother.

16:22.731 --> 16:23.732
Look, Arturito,

16:24.942 --> 16:26.527
if I throw you to the dogs,

16:26.986 --> 16:31.115
my cousin will be safe before your people
know what happened to you.

16:31.824 --> 16:33.742
I took that risk
when I ordered his release.

16:34.493 --> 16:35.619
So brave, aren't you?

16:41.333 --> 16:42.668
They released your cousin.

16:47.089 --> 16:49.675
Well, Chente is right.

16:50.843 --> 16:51.885
You have balls.

16:53.971 --> 16:55.305
You should work for us.

16:58.475 --> 17:00.227
If there's peace, we could all work
without problems.

17:02.354 --> 17:04.273
How can I tell you're not lying to me?

17:05.607 --> 17:07.651
If you don't trust Joaquín, trust me.

17:08.277 --> 17:09.403
I'll answer to you.

17:10.362 --> 17:12.573
I'll make sure all deals are honored.

17:55.824 --> 17:59.745
Joaquín, Chente and Cano agreed to meet.

18:02.915 --> 18:04.625
They're willing to negotiate peace.

18:06.210 --> 18:07.795
MEXICO CITY

18:07.878 --> 18:12.424
<i>With these confiscations, we are sending</i>
<i>a clear message to the Sinaloa Cartel.</i>

18:12.508 --> 18:13.383
CONRADO SOL
SECRETARY OF PUBLIC SECURITY

18:13.467 --> 18:17.304
<i>The government</i>
<i>and the public safety institutions</i>

18:17.429 --> 18:21.100
<i>won't stop until drug trafficking</i>
<i>is completely eradicated in this country.</i>

18:21.683 --> 18:24.561
<i>These were the words</i>
<i>of the Public Security Secretary</i>

18:24.853 --> 18:26.605
<i>who was accused in a Narco banner</i>

18:26.772 --> 18:29.900
<i>as being the nexus between the government</i>
<i>and the Sinaloa Cartel.</i>

18:30.234 --> 18:33.904
<i>Some think that these confiscations</i>
<i>were just a strategy of the government.</i>

18:53.382 --> 18:55.592
Your call will be transfered
to voice mail.

18:57.177 --> 18:58.137
It's me again.

19:00.556 --> 19:01.557
When can I see you?

19:04.309 --> 19:05.561
Are you being difficult?

19:06.770 --> 19:09.189
ARTURO BERNAL LEYDA'S RESIDENCE

19:17.948 --> 19:21.076
Boss, are you sure this is not a trap?

19:22.494 --> 19:24.955
He claims to negotiate peace
but on his turf.

19:25.873 --> 19:27.624
If you get attacked in Nuevo Laredo,

19:28.125 --> 19:29.918
it won't be easy to make it through.

19:30.043 --> 19:31.545
You gotta take the risk, Tono.

19:32.045 --> 19:34.590
If they want to kill us,
we'll take some of them with us.

19:37.134 --> 19:40.846
LA RIBERENA HIGHWAY
ROAD TO NUEVO LAREDO

20:00.908 --> 20:04.286
SECURITY RANCH

20:13.670 --> 20:15.088
Open the main door.

20:37.778 --> 20:38.820
Wait here.

21:58.108 --> 21:59.609
Didn't I tell you, Cano?

22:04.323 --> 22:06.116
If I were a girl,
I would have screwed you long ago.

22:19.046 --> 22:20.047
Come on.

22:23.592 --> 22:25.719
I'll respect the territory
you took from me,

22:25.886 --> 22:27.512
and you'll respect the one I took.

22:27.679 --> 22:29.181
And let the government work.

22:29.264 --> 22:31.433
Tell your government to stop chasing me,

22:32.059 --> 22:34.519
and I'll give the order
to not kill any more authorities.

22:35.145 --> 22:36.646
I can make them protect you,

22:36.813 --> 22:39.441
as they protect me, but that's not free.

22:39.775 --> 22:40.942
It costs a lot of money.

22:42.944 --> 22:44.988
Bring this motherfucker another whiskey!

22:45.280 --> 22:47.199
He managed to make us meet,
he deserves it.

22:47.991 --> 22:49.576
No one has danced with me yet,

22:50.535 --> 22:53.455
but we're doing fine. Good job, Arturo.

22:55.624 --> 22:57.375
Good times are coming, guys.

22:58.418 --> 22:59.586
Good times are coming.

23:03.381 --> 23:04.299
Thanks.

23:09.971 --> 23:11.348
Can you give us a moment?

23:14.267 --> 23:15.602
What's up Cano?

23:22.943 --> 23:25.654
What's up, Arturo?
Did you tell your brother what I told you?

23:26.321 --> 23:27.739
Tell him what?

23:29.449 --> 23:30.867
Look, man, I wasn't bluffing.

23:31.076 --> 23:35.205
And if we are here hanging out together,

23:35.288 --> 23:37.415
it's because you risked your neck.

23:38.583 --> 23:41.378
Not everyone would have dared
to achieve peace, brother.

23:43.421 --> 23:45.841
You convinced me to trust you.

23:48.385 --> 23:52.264
When I trust in someone,
I'm interested in how he's doing.

23:54.182 --> 23:55.684
If I were El Chapo, well,

23:57.060 --> 23:59.062
I'd be giving you a great reward.

24:03.608 --> 24:06.486
That Federation needs the hand
of the Bernal Leyda.

24:07.362 --> 24:08.446
Don't you forget it.

24:12.409 --> 24:13.243
Ladies!

24:17.706 --> 24:19.207
Congratulations, Conrado.

24:19.875 --> 24:22.002
-Excellent job.
-Thank you, sir.

24:35.640 --> 24:37.100
And you didn't want to.

24:39.019 --> 24:41.313
It wasn't that I didn't want to,
I had a lot of work.

24:49.613 --> 24:50.614
Your money.

24:59.664 --> 25:01.082
Now I charge double.

25:02.667 --> 25:03.793
Since when?

25:04.211 --> 25:06.254
Since I decided to raise my fee.

25:44.709 --> 25:47.295
Stop it, OK?
You'll put us out of business.

25:47.379 --> 25:49.381
Stop fucking around.

25:52.634 --> 25:53.969
I'm celebrating my success.

25:56.137 --> 25:57.889
You know what? Cano is right.

25:58.974 --> 26:00.767
<i>Joaquín wouldn't have achieved peace</i>
<i>without me.</i>

26:01.142 --> 26:02.018
He owes me.

26:19.327 --> 26:20.620
Why did you want to see us?

26:24.124 --> 26:26.918
We agree that I've done a lot
for the Federation, don't we?

26:28.336 --> 26:30.130
I got the agreement without shooting.

26:30.880 --> 26:32.674
-I defended Acapulco.
-I know, I know.

26:32.841 --> 26:34.092
I acknowledge it.

26:35.427 --> 26:38.179
Stop beating around the bush
and tell us what you want.

26:41.057 --> 26:43.018
I want to be in charge of the new business

26:43.101 --> 26:45.020
between the government, Juarez,
and Nuevo Laredo.

26:54.112 --> 26:55.196
It's not a bad idea.

26:55.822 --> 26:56.906
But we have to wait.

26:57.490 --> 26:59.826
Now it's time to use the peace
we have achieved...

27:00.869 --> 27:03.246
to improve our products
and increase the business.

27:03.371 --> 27:04.956
The peace that I have achieved.

27:06.708 --> 27:08.126
We'll talk about your request later.

27:16.176 --> 27:18.595
Have the special forces
watch the Bernal Leyda.

27:19.220 --> 27:21.014
I wanna know all of their movements.

27:23.224 --> 27:25.769
Now, buddy, let's focus on business.

27:26.394 --> 27:27.228
OK.

27:34.402 --> 27:36.321
Those are already spoken for.
Went for 30 million.

27:36.404 --> 27:37.572
COCAINE CULTIVATION ZONE
COLOMBIA

27:38.114 --> 27:39.574
I'll pay that price for them,

27:40.909 --> 27:42.243
but for the rest I'll give you half.

27:43.203 --> 27:45.413
Why? If they're well located.

27:45.663 --> 27:47.248
But they're over-planted.

27:47.499 --> 27:49.501
It would take a lot to get a good crop.

27:51.127 --> 27:54.547
Look, if you really want
to do business with me,

27:55.673 --> 27:56.966
don't treat me like a rookie.

27:59.761 --> 28:01.554
<i>We're ready in Colombia, Peru and Bolivia.</i>

28:02.013 --> 28:04.974
Now I'm heading to Chicago,
and then to Spain.

28:05.308 --> 28:07.227
<i>We'll see if we can produce cheaper</i>
<i>over there,</i>

28:07.310 --> 28:08.645
<i>and export to the rest of Europe.</i>

28:08.853 --> 28:11.022
Keep me informed. Have a nice trip.

28:12.107 --> 28:13.024
Continue, doc.

28:13.483 --> 28:16.027
I was telling you,
the great benefit of this hybrid

28:16.111 --> 28:19.197
is that it produces effects
similar to cocaine.

28:19.781 --> 28:21.950
Instead of making you drowsy,
it wakes you up.

28:22.784 --> 28:28.039
It's 75% genetic indica and 25% sativa.

28:28.581 --> 28:31.543
With this plant,
you'll break the American market.

28:33.962 --> 28:34.796
Produce it.

28:35.922 --> 28:37.298
POPPY GROWING FIELD

29:00.238 --> 29:01.656
Let's take a break, guys!

29:03.658 --> 29:05.285
We are close to getting this gram.

29:07.078 --> 29:08.788
The first one I grew myself.

29:10.623 --> 29:13.209
-From El Valle to Chicago.
-Awesome, dude.

29:13.293 --> 29:14.586
If you want, I'll go with you.

29:14.961 --> 29:16.337
We could learn both, right?

29:17.130 --> 29:18.590
If Joaquín is not going
to acknowledge my efforts,

29:18.673 --> 29:21.092
then we'll have to move alone.

29:22.177 --> 29:23.511
Don't rush it, brother.

29:24.179 --> 29:26.222
He didn't say no,
he just said we'll have to wait.

29:26.431 --> 29:27.724
I'm sick of waiting.

29:29.017 --> 29:29.851
Here...

29:31.019 --> 29:32.687
the business is growing a lot.

29:33.480 --> 29:35.607
There's room for us to lead, too.

29:39.736 --> 29:40.695
Are you with me?

29:42.280 --> 29:43.740
Yeah, I'll follow you.

29:56.920 --> 29:58.880
Chente, this is Arturo.

29:59.339 --> 30:01.341
<i>I need you to do me a favor.</i>

30:01.883 --> 30:04.427
<i>That's not a favor, Arturo.</i>
<i>That's business.</i>

30:05.261 --> 30:06.513
Even better, right?

30:07.972 --> 30:08.890
Are you in?

30:20.151 --> 30:23.196
So you were going
to move heroin through Juarez?

30:24.322 --> 30:25.156
What's the problem?

30:25.657 --> 30:27.116
I saw a chance and took it.

30:27.283 --> 30:28.493
Your dogs are wrong

30:28.576 --> 30:31.204
if they think I wouldn't give the cut
to the Federation.

30:32.914 --> 30:35.083
I'm with the Federation,
you can't deny that.

30:36.501 --> 30:38.795
You should have talked to us first.

30:39.254 --> 30:42.841
I got a good price, one that will give
major profits to all of us.

30:43.758 --> 30:45.093
Isn't that what's important?

30:48.012 --> 30:49.973
You skipped a rule of the Federation.

30:53.768 --> 30:55.520
A Federation rule or your rule?

31:00.483 --> 31:03.820
Besides, we never said
we couldn't make deals with them.

31:04.821 --> 31:07.073
The best for all is that I bring in
a lot of money,

31:07.156 --> 31:08.366
and that's what I'm doing.

31:12.537 --> 31:13.413
Isn't it?

31:16.875 --> 31:18.209
Good afternoon, everyone.

31:18.585 --> 31:20.253
Your bills have been paid.

31:20.670 --> 31:22.463
We have to ask you
to give us your cellphones.

31:23.923 --> 31:26.426
-Thank you.
<i>-What happened to your uncle</i>

31:26.509 --> 31:28.261
<i>was heavy, but now everything</i>
<i>has calmed down.</i>

31:29.596 --> 31:30.930
<i>The business is growing.</i>

31:32.307 --> 31:34.142
-What about you?
-Doing great.

31:34.559 --> 31:36.019
I'm about to make my third cross
of the border.

31:36.144 --> 31:38.646
You have to be punctual and precise
with the gringos, Quino.

31:39.856 --> 31:41.149
They do not accept delays.

31:41.566 --> 31:43.693
-They gossiped to you about it?
-If it happened, then it's not gossip.

31:44.277 --> 31:46.070
If you're doing the business, do it right.

31:50.450 --> 31:51.326
What about you?

31:53.620 --> 31:55.163
It's a hassle cultivating the paste.

31:55.872 --> 31:57.749
-They told me you're at the ranch.
-Yes,

31:57.832 --> 31:59.417
I'm learning so they can't fool me.

32:00.501 --> 32:02.921
I think I'm ready to make
my first crossing.

32:03.087 --> 32:04.047
OK...

32:04.839 --> 32:06.966
just don't leave school, son.

32:07.091 --> 32:08.676
Are we done?
I need to go to Guadalajara after this.

32:08.760 --> 32:09.844
Stop using that shit!

32:11.346 --> 32:13.431
And stop playing games
with your bodyguards.

32:14.223 --> 32:16.184
I know that you're leaving them behind.

32:18.645 --> 32:19.979
You should teach them to drive better.

32:40.708 --> 32:41.626
Thanks.

32:44.754 --> 32:47.131
Hey, you, long time no see.

32:50.259 --> 32:51.886
-Your allowance.
-Thanks.

32:53.221 --> 32:54.222
Did you get fat?

32:55.056 --> 32:56.849
The girls don't like them old and fat.

32:56.933 --> 32:57.976
I would take care of myself.

32:58.643 --> 32:59.519
Take care, son.

33:01.437 --> 33:02.897
One day I'll come check your field.

33:03.731 --> 33:04.607
OK.

33:08.027 --> 33:10.655
Quino, your father's
gonna kill us. Where are you?

33:10.780 --> 33:11.698
<i>Pull over.</i>

33:15.410 --> 33:16.285
<i>Pull over!</i>

33:35.346 --> 33:36.389
Good evening.

33:37.098 --> 33:38.099
Your driver license, please.

33:38.182 --> 33:39.809
You have exceeded the speed limit.

33:39.976 --> 33:41.019
How much do you want? I'm in a hurry.

33:42.520 --> 33:44.313
Sir, how much did you drink?

33:44.731 --> 33:48.317
Look, my dad is Joaquín Guzman Loera.
You don't want to get in trouble.

33:51.946 --> 33:53.865
Could you please get out of the vehicle,

33:53.990 --> 33:56.367
open the trunk, and give me the money?

33:57.035 --> 34:00.663
So my partner can't see,
and I don't take more of your time.

34:03.791 --> 34:07.545
I have nothing against you
or your father, but law is law.

34:07.628 --> 34:08.838
INCOMING CALL
TALKER

34:14.761 --> 34:15.595
What's up?

34:15.678 --> 34:17.221
<i>Sir, they took Quino.</i>

34:18.765 --> 34:21.100
And what are you waiting for?
Get him out, that's what I pay you for.

34:21.184 --> 34:22.602
<i>It's not that easy, sir.</i>

34:22.727 --> 34:24.228
<i>The police who took him</i>
<i>said that he was your son.</i>

34:24.312 --> 34:27.482
<i>And you know that the reporters</i>
<i>hack our radio. The press is here.</i>

34:28.107 --> 34:30.568
<i>The latest statistics show</i>
<i>an apparent decrease</i>

34:30.651 --> 34:32.070
<i>of violence in Mexico.</i>

34:32.487 --> 34:34.947
<i>The Secretary of Public Security,</i>
<i>Conrado Sol,</i>

34:35.198 --> 34:36.699
<i>has spoken out about it.</i>

34:36.949 --> 34:41.454
We will celebrate only
when there are no more executions,

34:41.913 --> 34:43.873
<i>and all the citizens can live at peace.</i>

34:48.753 --> 34:51.130
-Joaquín.
-My son was captured in Guadalajara.

34:52.632 --> 34:53.633
POLICE STATION

34:53.966 --> 34:55.885
<i>-What did he do?</i>
<i>-That doesn't matter. Get him out.</i>

34:56.677 --> 34:58.054
<i>Before this get bigger.</i>

35:02.975 --> 35:06.437
You'll see me when I get out!
Just wait, faggot!

35:11.567 --> 35:12.610
Why is he still locked up?

35:13.194 --> 35:15.571
Because he is your son
and we have the press on our heels.

35:15.696 --> 35:16.906
You have to get him out.

35:16.989 --> 35:19.117
-His mom is going mad.
-I can't, Joaquín.

35:20.409 --> 35:21.619
If I do it, all the news

35:21.702 --> 35:23.663
would show the Narco banner with my name.

35:23.955 --> 35:26.541
Quino is not important
for the organization, Conrado.

35:28.709 --> 35:30.336
I can give you important people

35:30.753 --> 35:32.004
to distract the press.

35:33.047 --> 35:35.091
Major arrests that will help your image.

35:36.425 --> 35:37.760
I can deal with that.

35:39.512 --> 35:41.013
Who are you going to turn in?

36:25.850 --> 36:27.143
Joaquín will be here soon.

36:28.728 --> 36:30.188
Do you want something to eat?

36:30.730 --> 36:31.898
I'm fine, thanks.

36:38.738 --> 36:41.407
The safety of Quino
is very important to me, Joaquín.

36:44.160 --> 36:45.620
That's why I brought you this,

36:47.163 --> 36:48.998
to protect him before we get him out.

36:53.127 --> 36:54.170
Thanks, man.

36:55.171 --> 36:57.715
I got the address of the station
were he's being held.

36:59.717 --> 37:02.595
Say the word and we'll get him out
before they take him to the penitentiary.

37:04.222 --> 37:05.723
I want to get him now,

37:05.932 --> 37:08.643
but if we do that we break the deal
with the government,

37:09.268 --> 37:11.187
and that's not good for the Federation.

37:12.939 --> 37:16.859
Thanks, buddy. Our lawyer Lora
is working on ways to get him out.

37:17.818 --> 37:18.653
OK.

37:19.695 --> 37:21.405
If you change your mind,

37:22.698 --> 37:24.158
you can count on me, and on Arriero, too.

37:31.499 --> 37:34.001
Hey, are you gonna drink for his birthday?

37:34.210 --> 37:36.963
Yeah, it will be at my brother's house
like usual. You coming?

37:37.755 --> 37:38.923
I'll be there later.

37:39.799 --> 37:40.633
OK.

37:50.434 --> 37:53.521
I'm on my way.
You better have whiskey, you hear me?

37:54.021 --> 37:56.148
If you don't hurry, you won't get
a single drop, fucker.

37:56.315 --> 37:57.191
OK.

37:58.359 --> 38:01.320
<i>My soul is filled with pain</i>

38:01.988 --> 38:05.074
<i>Since you are not here any more</i>

38:07.868 --> 38:08.828
Holy crap.

38:11.330 --> 38:12.790
They will celebrate me in private.

38:18.629 --> 38:19.505
See you later.

38:20.256 --> 38:21.090
Make yourselves at home.

40:04.819 --> 40:06.779
On the floor! Don't move!

40:19.291 --> 40:20.209
Freeze!

40:20.709 --> 40:21.585
Don't move!

40:21.669 --> 40:23.379
-What the fuck?
-Put your hands up!

40:23.462 --> 40:25.464
Nobody moves. Where's Arturo Bernal?

40:25.631 --> 40:27.716
I'm Alfredo Bernal Leyda,
talk to your superiors.

40:27.800 --> 40:28.717
Come on!

40:36.350 --> 40:37.351
Yes?

40:38.394 --> 40:41.063
<i>Arturo, the federals</i>
<i>just took your brother.</i>

40:58.414 --> 41:00.458
Conrado, when will you get my son?

41:01.333 --> 41:04.753
I'm on it, but you gave me just one
of the Bernal Leyda.

41:05.713 --> 41:06.589
What do you mean just one?

41:10.759 --> 41:12.178
Arturo wasn't there.

41:16.307 --> 41:18.809
Do not let the press find out
about Quino until we find him.

41:19.768 --> 41:21.395
I'll delay it as much as I can.

41:23.606 --> 41:24.857
Arturo escaped.

41:29.987 --> 41:31.155
We have to find him now,

41:31.989 --> 41:34.033
or shit's going to hit the fan.

41:42.875 --> 41:45.711
Find him. We have to get that fucker.

41:49.006 --> 41:51.759
<i>Since we modified our strategy</i>
<i>of fighting drug trafficking,</i>

41:52.009 --> 41:54.261
<i>the federal forces and the Army</i>

41:54.637 --> 41:58.057
<i>have captured more than 50 members</i>
<i>of organized crime.</i>

41:59.016 --> 42:02.353
<i>Now we add the capture</i>
<i>of Alfredo Bernal Leyda,</i>

42:03.187 --> 42:08.526
<i>aka "El Arriero," one of the big fishes</i>
<i>of the Sinaloa Cartel.</i>
