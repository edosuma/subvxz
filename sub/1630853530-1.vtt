WEBVTT

00:10.594 --> 00:14.932
I began a quest for the presidency,
a quest with many ideas,

00:15.015 --> 00:18.227
but with one driving theme:

00:18.310 --> 00:23.565
that our party and our nation
need new leadership, new direction,

00:23.649 --> 00:24.733
and new hope.

00:26.235 --> 00:30.864
Tonight, the torch of idealism
is lit in thousands of homes,

00:30.948 --> 00:36.119
in tens of thousands of towns
and hundreds of thousands of lives

00:36.203 --> 00:39.122
among the young in spirit
and the young in age.

00:39.206 --> 00:42.417
-It cannot go out. It will not go out.
-Five, four, three…

00:42.501 --> 00:45.003
-It will continue to burn.
-…two, and one.

00:48.590 --> 00:50.425
President Reagan and Premier Andropov

00:50.509 --> 00:53.011
signed a lunar peace treaty
essentially dividing the moon in two.

00:53.095 --> 00:54.388
Congressional report details

00:54.471 --> 00:58.392
how the lunar base's near meltdown
was averted and how safety…

00:58.475 --> 01:01.854
Famed US astronaut hangout,
The Outpost, has now opened franchises

01:01.937 --> 01:04.730
in New York, Los Angeles, Berlin,
and Tokyo.

01:04.815 --> 01:07.901
The host of Jeopardy! Alex Trebek.

01:12.489 --> 01:16.660
Gorbachev's policies have
the Soviet Union's economy in hyperdrive,

01:16.743 --> 01:18.745
expanding Soviet influence
across the globe.

01:18.829 --> 01:20.664
Major breakthrough in nuclear fusion.

01:20.747 --> 01:24.042
The reactor, developed by Dev Ayesa
and Richard Hilliard, has the potential…

01:24.126 --> 01:26.295
Republican, Ellen Wilson,
a former astronaut,

01:26.378 --> 01:28.297
-won her Texas Senate race handily…
-God bless Texas.

01:28.380 --> 01:31.383
Baldwin and Cleveland launched
the world's first space tourism company,

01:31.466 --> 01:32.634
Polaris Space Tours.

01:34.887 --> 01:37.222
The Beatles reunion tour
begins in Chicago,

01:37.306 --> 01:40.100
their first time performing in the US
since 1966.

01:40.184 --> 01:43.562
…contract to mine
massive deposits of helium-3 on the moon,

01:43.645 --> 01:46.190
an ideal resource for nuclear fusion.

01:48.275 --> 01:49.902
The North Korean government announced

01:49.985 --> 01:52.613
they are abandoning their
controversial ballistic missile program

01:52.696 --> 01:53.906
to focus on their space program.

01:53.989 --> 01:57.284
…Hart won reelection in
a landslide over Republican Pat Robertson.

01:57.367 --> 02:00.162
The stakes of 1988 could not be higher.

02:00.913 --> 02:02.831
The choices could not be clearer.

02:05.209 --> 02:09.086
Scientist James Hansen
testified that global warming has slowed

02:09.170 --> 02:11.673
due to the widespread shift
from fossil fuels to nuclear fusion.

02:11.757 --> 02:13.217
…the ambassador to Moscow,

02:13.300 --> 02:16.261
after several listening devices
were discovered in the American embassy.

02:16.345 --> 02:18.430
The film Love in the Skies,
based on the lives

02:18.514 --> 02:21.475
of Gordo and Tracy Stevens,
premiered in Hollywood…

02:23.393 --> 02:25.062
The Thomas Paine space telescope

02:25.145 --> 02:27.523
will be launched into orbit
aboard the Pathfinder…

02:27.606 --> 02:30.400
Astronaut Danny Stevens,
the son of Gordo and Tracy Stevens,

02:30.484 --> 02:31.902
has arrived at the Jamestown…

02:31.985 --> 02:34.488
Polaris Space Tours
has announced their latest venture.

02:34.571 --> 02:37.115
…sending folks up in space, we might
as well give them some place to sleep.

02:37.199 --> 02:39.576
Gary Hart has again declined
to send troops to Kuwait,

02:39.660 --> 02:40.702
after the small nation…

02:40.786 --> 02:42.829
The United States is going to Mars.

02:42.913 --> 02:45.165
NASA unveiled their plans
for the Sojourner 1 spacecraft.

02:45.249 --> 02:48.961
Questions remain if the Soviets
will also be able to launch in 1996.

02:49.044 --> 02:50.796
Texas Senator Ellen Wilson has announced

02:50.879 --> 02:53.298
that she is running
for Republican nomination for president.

02:53.382 --> 02:55.592
South Carolina, here we come.

02:55.676 --> 02:58.554
…Clinton pledged a positive campaign

02:58.637 --> 03:01.348
focused on building a bridge
to the 21st century.

03:01.431 --> 03:05.102
We will give you more incentives
and more opportunity than ever before

03:05.185 --> 03:07.271
to develop the skills of your workers

03:07.354 --> 03:10.357
and to create American jobs
and American wealth

03:10.440 --> 03:12.985
in the new global space economy.

03:13.068 --> 03:14.695
As the scripture says,

03:14.778 --> 03:18.323
our eyes have not yet seen,
nor our ears heard,

03:18.407 --> 03:22.619
nor our minds imagined what we can do.

03:37.926 --> 03:39.553
This is Karen.

03:39.636 --> 03:40.679
Hey, you.

03:40.762 --> 03:42.097
Hi, Sam.

03:42.181 --> 03:43.265
How'd you sleep?

03:44.558 --> 03:46.101
Not a wink. You?

03:46.894 --> 03:47.895
Like a baby.

03:49.104 --> 03:50.105
Liar.

03:51.273 --> 03:52.608
Come on. Be honest with me.

03:52.691 --> 03:54.651
It's growing on you, being up here,
isn't it?

03:56.111 --> 03:57.112
Not at all.

03:57.196 --> 03:58.530
Still hate it.

04:00.115 --> 04:04.745
Well, the guests are almost here,
so put your game face on.

04:05.787 --> 04:07.039
I'm ready.

04:07.122 --> 04:09.708
Yeah, all right. You better be.
We'll see you in an hour.

04:09.791 --> 04:10.792
All right.

07:35.038 --> 07:36.623
Morning, Ms. Madison.

07:36.707 --> 07:39.126
Morning, Ms. Jorgens.

07:40.002 --> 07:42.921
Sorry, ma'am. Here are your messages.

07:43.005 --> 07:44.256
The Secretary of Agriculture called.

07:44.339 --> 07:47.426
He was wondering if you had any time
to consider his funding request.

07:47.509 --> 07:48.927
I've considered it.

07:49.011 --> 07:52.848
Not sure how financing
his pesticide research is NASA's job.

07:52.931 --> 07:56.435
Tell him she's still considering
the finer points of the proposal.

07:56.518 --> 07:59.354
Administrator Truly wanted to speak to you

07:59.438 --> 08:02.024
regarding the selection of the Mars
mission's commander, if--

08:02.107 --> 08:04.359
-Not now.
-Okay. Let's see.

08:04.443 --> 08:07.529
Neptune Records called.
The new album you ordered has arrived.

08:07.613 --> 08:09.281
I'll pick it up later today.

08:10.240 --> 08:14.536
And Mr. Ayesa from Helios Aerospace
called about the priority launches

08:14.620 --> 08:16.121
for his helium-3 mining equipment.

08:16.205 --> 08:17.206
And…

08:18.373 --> 08:19.750
he sent a gift.

08:19.833 --> 08:23.253
Apparently, the smoked whitefish was
flown in fresh from Norway this morning.

08:24.171 --> 08:25.589
Send it back.

08:25.672 --> 08:28.509
And remind him
we don't accept bribes at NASA.

08:29.676 --> 08:31.094
Let's go around the world.

08:34.264 --> 08:37.518
The State Department is reporting
another failed North Korean launch.

08:37.601 --> 08:38.894
They reached orbit this time,

08:38.977 --> 08:41.938
but the upper stage exploded
before the spacecraft could be deployed.

08:42.022 --> 08:44.900
Maybe that's because they keep using
outdated Soviet equipment.

08:44.983 --> 08:46.568
Have we tracked the path of the debris?

08:46.652 --> 08:49.238
Yes. Currently, no sign of danger
to any orbital craft,

08:49.321 --> 08:51.740
but we have alerted the Soviets,
Chinese and Europeans

08:51.823 --> 08:53.700
to continue monitoring the situation.

08:54.701 --> 08:57.371
The repairs to the Thomas Paine
orbital telescope went well.

08:57.454 --> 09:00.832
And the shuttle Enterprise is slated
to return to Earth tomorrow morning,

09:00.916 --> 09:02.125
so that's good news.

09:02.209 --> 09:04.962
Just the information, please.
No commentary.

09:05.045 --> 09:06.171
Sorry. Yes, ma'am.

09:06.672 --> 09:08.882
A reminder that Polaris's
new orbital hotel

09:08.966 --> 09:12.344
is holding that wedding this afternoon
before they officially open next month.

09:12.427 --> 09:15.347
Space tourism. God help us all.

09:15.430 --> 09:17.057
We sent something, right?

09:17.891 --> 09:18.892
Yes, ma'am.

09:34.449 --> 09:36.618
How's it looking, Propulsion? Let's roll.

09:37.619 --> 09:38.662
Copy.

09:40.038 --> 09:42.374
Jamestown, initiate hot fire test.

09:43.417 --> 09:48.338
Copy.
Initiating K-32 NERVA engine hot fire test

09:48.422 --> 09:52.009
in three, two, one.

09:55.179 --> 09:56.388
Engine start.

10:01.059 --> 10:04.229
Chamber pressure now at 3860 kPa.

10:15.741 --> 10:16.992
Hang on.

10:17.075 --> 10:18.577
Cooler pressure is jammed.

10:19.953 --> 10:21.121
Bypass flow is down.

10:24.458 --> 10:25.876
We're losing cooling in the core.

10:28.795 --> 10:30.547
Motherfucking fuck.

10:30.631 --> 10:32.758
What happened?
I thought we fixed all the bugs.

10:32.841 --> 10:36.053
We should be up there
roasting marshmallows by now, people.

10:36.136 --> 10:37.554
If we don't get this engine functioning,

10:37.638 --> 10:40.224
-we're not gonna be able to make--
-Make the '96 Mars launch window.

10:40.307 --> 10:42.935
-I know.
-Okay. So, work the problem.

10:43.018 --> 10:44.937
Have you tried to increase
the turbopump pressure?

10:45.020 --> 10:46.146
Yeah. I looked into that.

10:46.230 --> 10:48.440
But then the flow to the injector
drops below spec.

10:48.524 --> 10:51.401
You'll get there. Keep digging.

10:52.110 --> 10:53.111
Yeah.

10:58.909 --> 11:00.244
Send all your notes over.

11:00.327 --> 11:04.790
We are pleased to
officially confirm that the Soviet Union

11:04.873 --> 11:08.919
will be launching
a manned mission to Mars in 1996.

11:10.379 --> 11:15.926
The USSR will once again be victorious
as the first nation

11:16.009 --> 11:20.013
to set foot on humanity's
newest frontier, the Red Planet.

11:20.931 --> 11:22.140
Now, I would like to introduce

11:22.224 --> 11:25.352
the commander of the mission,
Comrade Grigory Kuznetsov.

11:25.435 --> 11:27.437
Comrade Kuznetsov exemplifies

11:27.521 --> 11:31.191
the strength and intelligence
of the Soviet space program.

11:31.775 --> 11:33.652
Well, the president's not gonna be happy.

11:33.735 --> 11:36.238
We need to respond.
Make it clear we're going to be first.

11:36.321 --> 11:39.241
And the way to be first
is to get there first.

11:39.324 --> 11:42.160
-Boots on the ground. Right, General?
-Yes, ma'am.

11:42.244 --> 11:43.245
Ms. Madison,

11:43.328 --> 11:46.748
the president's been asking again
about our own commander selection.

11:46.832 --> 11:49.543
It's been weeks since we
narrowed it down to Baldwin and Poole.

11:49.626 --> 11:51.545
And now that the Russians
have picked their--

11:51.628 --> 11:52.713
I'm working on it.

12:04.516 --> 12:06.560
Polaris, shuttle two.

12:06.643 --> 12:08.353
Beginning final approach for docking.

12:08.896 --> 12:10.522
Roger that, shuttle two.

12:10.606 --> 12:12.566
Cleared for docking at Port Bravo.

12:13.692 --> 12:17.070
Polaris,
shuttle two inside hands-off point.

12:21.575 --> 12:24.828
Commander LaPorte, shuttle number two
has successfully docked.

12:24.912 --> 12:27.164
Good. Proceed with crew transfer.

12:27.247 --> 12:31.168
First group of passengers preparing
to exit shuttle two for elevator.

12:31.251 --> 12:35.005
Copy. Elevator ready
and waiting for descent from main hub.

12:42.721 --> 12:43.931
This is weird.

12:46.058 --> 12:49.770
We came in peace for all your cash.

12:52.773 --> 12:55.442
I'm just glad I'll be on my way
to Mars in a few years

12:55.526 --> 12:58.695
and leave all this bullshit
to you lowly Earth dwellers.

12:59.321 --> 13:02.991
Come on, old man.
You know I've got this in the bag.

13:18.674 --> 13:20.884
Welcome to the Polaris Orbital Hotel.

13:20.968 --> 13:23.095
I'll show you to your rooms
so you can get settled

13:23.178 --> 13:25.764
before we have a brief review
of yesterday's safety seminar.

13:25.848 --> 13:29.142
The artificial gravity
created by our hotel's constant rotation

13:29.226 --> 13:33.730
allows for all kinds of amenities
that astronauts could only dream of,

13:34.314 --> 13:39.987
including a fitness center,
two cafés and room service.

13:41.113 --> 13:46.618
Welcome to Hotel Polaris.
And enjoy your stay among the stars.

13:49.121 --> 13:52.291
Wow. It's like being on The Love Boat.

13:53.750 --> 13:55.419
Yeah, and that must be Gopher.

13:58.380 --> 13:59.840
That was a good one.

13:59.923 --> 14:02.050
Sweetie, if you're feeling sick,
that's totally normal.

14:02.134 --> 14:05.012
I know it takes me time
to get adjusted to being up in space.

14:05.637 --> 14:07.514
-I'm fine.
-Yeah?

14:07.598 --> 14:08.849
Got our room key.

14:09.975 --> 14:11.185
Hello, Ed.

14:12.102 --> 14:13.562
-Karen.
-Hi.

14:13.645 --> 14:15.314
Hi. Sam.

14:15.397 --> 14:16.773
-Good to see you, bud.
-You too.

14:19.026 --> 14:21.612
You remember Yvonne, don't you?

14:21.695 --> 14:23.197
Yes, of course.

14:24.656 --> 14:28.452
By the way, congratulations. Kelly showed
me all the photos. You looked lovely.

14:28.535 --> 14:31.997
Thank you. Thanks. It was small.

14:32.080 --> 14:33.916
-Just a few friends in our backyard.
-Yeah.

14:33.999 --> 14:37.836
Nothing like this. I mean… Wow.

14:37.920 --> 14:40.172
Talk about the ultimate
destination wedding. Am I right?

14:40.255 --> 14:42.382
Yeah. Yeah.

14:42.466 --> 14:44.343
-How was the flight?
-Nice.

14:44.426 --> 14:47.930
Yeah. Docking was good.
Your pilots know what they're doing.

14:48.013 --> 14:50.724
Well, they should.
Karen poached them all from NASA.

14:50.807 --> 14:51.892
That's right.

14:53.977 --> 14:55.145
-Well, we should probably--
-Yeah.

14:55.229 --> 14:57.773
Go get settled in.
Enjoy the hotel and your day.

14:57.856 --> 14:59.149
-See you later.
-All righty.

14:59.233 --> 15:00.234
Bye.

15:01.777 --> 15:05.280
-Do you want me to get that?
-No, I got it. I got it, yeah.

15:06.448 --> 15:07.699
That wasn't awkward at all.

15:08.825 --> 15:09.826
No.

15:19.878 --> 15:20.963
Margo.

15:26.885 --> 15:29.471
You know we banned smoking
in this building last month.

15:30.055 --> 15:31.390
I had no idea.

15:32.933 --> 15:34.309
You should put up some signs.

15:37.855 --> 15:41.650
The Russians have just announced
the commander for their Mars mission.

15:42.359 --> 15:44.820
Why haven't we announced Danielle Poole
as our commander?

15:44.903 --> 15:46.655
Because I haven't made up my mind yet.

15:46.738 --> 15:49.825
But we've gone over this.
She's clearly the right choice.

15:49.908 --> 15:51.702
She has all the qualities
we're looking for.

15:52.953 --> 15:54.746
And what are those exactly?

15:57.082 --> 16:01.587
Intellect. Moderate temperament.
Solid decision-making.

16:03.505 --> 16:04.798
She's commanded more missions

16:04.882 --> 16:08.135
than any other astronaut in the program
the last ten years.

16:08.218 --> 16:11.763
Look, I like Poole. I trained with Poole.

16:12.931 --> 16:19.188
I don't know that she's right to command
a high-stress mission like this.

16:19.271 --> 16:20.731
She's too cerebral.

16:21.315 --> 16:22.774
She's too by the book.

16:23.775 --> 16:25.194
Are those even negative traits?

16:25.277 --> 16:26.862
What I am trying to say is,

16:26.945 --> 16:29.823
I think we need someone
who's willing to take risks,

16:29.907 --> 16:31.450
who can handle the unknown.

16:31.533 --> 16:33.202
Someone like Ed Baldwin.

16:33.285 --> 16:34.828
If the shoe fits.

16:38.790 --> 16:43.003
Let's be honest.
He's arrogant and he's got a temper,

16:43.086 --> 16:44.421
and, to be frank, he's old.

16:45.464 --> 16:47.925
I think you mean experienced.

16:48.008 --> 16:50.677
No. I mean old.

16:51.178 --> 16:53.764
This isn't Gemini, Molly. NASA's changing.

16:53.847 --> 16:56.600
We can't just rely on test pilots anymore.

16:56.683 --> 16:58.936
-It's the scientists, the engineers--
-Oh, my God.

16:59.019 --> 17:00.771
Are we having this conversation again?

17:00.854 --> 17:02.022
Yes, we are.

17:02.564 --> 17:06.859
More than 50% of last year's ASCAN class
were former pilots and test pilots.

17:06.944 --> 17:07.944
That's right.

17:08.028 --> 17:10.280
Because I need people
who can think on their feet,

17:10.364 --> 17:12.449
who aren't reaching
for an instruction manual

17:12.532 --> 17:15.243
to figure out what to do
every time the shit hits the fan.

17:15.327 --> 17:19.248
NASA may be changing, Margo,
but space remains an unrelenting bitch.

17:19.330 --> 17:22.251
The flight to Mars is only
the first three months

17:22.334 --> 17:23.502
of a two-year mission.

17:23.585 --> 17:25.087
You seriously think Ed--

17:29.424 --> 17:33.011
You seriously think Ed Baldwin is
better suited to handle that?

17:33.095 --> 17:35.973
Well, giving out command slots
based on anything other than ability

17:36.056 --> 17:38.225
is a recipe for screwing the pooch.
You know that!

17:38.308 --> 17:40.811
-Molly, that's not what I--
-And as head of the Astronaut office,

17:40.894 --> 17:42.938
-I decide who goes up--
-Decide who goes up and when.

17:43.021 --> 17:44.231
I know. I know.

17:52.906 --> 17:57.077
Let's continue this discussion
when I'm back from Huntsville.

17:57.160 --> 17:58.537
I can't wait.

18:08.338 --> 18:14.386
As you stand before God
and in this divine place,

18:14.970 --> 18:19.391
I pronounce you man and wife.
You may kiss the bride.

18:32.613 --> 18:34.406
-I love you.
-I love you too.

18:38.285 --> 18:40.954
There they are. Yeah!

18:43.540 --> 18:45.417
Congratulations.

18:45.501 --> 18:47.127
-Congratulations.
-Thanks.

18:48.337 --> 18:50.464
-Thank you.
-Congratulations.

18:55.427 --> 18:56.803
I'm proud of you, kid.

18:58.138 --> 19:00.557
You done good. You done real good.

19:02.017 --> 19:05.103
-Congratulations. Oh, my goodness.
-Thank you.

19:05.187 --> 19:07.648
-You look so handsome.
-Thanks.

19:08.941 --> 19:11.610
-Congratulations.
-Thanks, Karen.

19:12.611 --> 19:14.154
-You're welcome.
-Yeah.

19:20.118 --> 19:25.666
Hey, hey. Ho-ha. Oil over helium.

19:30.754 --> 19:34.258
…the stock price for
the space tourism company Polaris

19:34.341 --> 19:36.093
shot through the roof this morning

19:36.176 --> 19:40.305
as its new hotel hosts
the first-ever wedding in space

19:40.389 --> 19:44.226
for the son of American heroes
Gordo and Tracy Stevens.

19:44.309 --> 19:47.145
The wedding is a soft launch,
pardon the pun--

20:09.209 --> 20:10.836
-Hello?
-Sergei.

20:10.919 --> 20:12.921
-Margo, hi.
-How are you?

20:13.005 --> 20:17.092
I'm-- I'm cold, but well.

20:18.010 --> 20:20.053
What album did I order this time?

20:20.137 --> 20:22.639
It's Mary Lou Williams.

20:24.224 --> 20:25.726
Do you know of her?

20:25.809 --> 20:27.603
One of the great improvisers.

20:28.520 --> 20:29.897
Like you, Margo.

20:30.731 --> 20:32.316
I don't know about that.

20:32.399 --> 20:35.777
Well, we can use
your assistance once again.

20:35.861 --> 20:40.782
Our engineers are having difficulty
with the asymmetric torque

20:40.866 --> 20:42.409
in our Mars orbiters.

20:42.492 --> 20:46.538
I'll see what I can do.
I'll get it to you the usual way.

20:46.622 --> 20:48.749
Thank you. Thank you so much, Margo.

20:48.832 --> 20:50.000
I should be thanking you.

20:50.083 --> 20:54.796
That attitude control fix last month
to our GNC subsystem

20:54.880 --> 20:55.923
worked like a charm.

20:56.673 --> 21:01.136
We discovered it while integrating
sensor systems on the N3.

21:01.220 --> 21:02.804
I'm glad it was of use.

21:02.888 --> 21:03.972
It was.

21:05.140 --> 21:09.144
And congratulations on the announcement.

21:09.228 --> 21:15.567
Could you have imagined when
we first met-- Oh, God-- ten years ago,

21:15.651 --> 21:17.819
that we would be here now,

21:19.279 --> 21:22.324
both preparing for the journey to Mars?

21:22.407 --> 21:25.160
It would not have happened
without your help, Margo.

21:25.244 --> 21:30.749
I just pointed you in the right direction,
every once in a while.

21:31.333 --> 21:32.793
Same as you did for me.

21:34.253 --> 21:39.591
Only a few more weeks
until this year's IAC conference.

21:39.675 --> 21:41.176
We will toast to Mars.

21:41.260 --> 21:45.138
We're not there yet, Sergei.
Four years to go.

21:45.222 --> 21:46.223
Okay.

21:46.807 --> 21:49.893
First London, then Mars.

21:51.937 --> 21:53.063
I cannot wait.

21:54.064 --> 21:55.065
Neither can I.

22:18.172 --> 22:19.214
Hello?

22:19.715 --> 22:21.884
You must press her for more details

22:21.967 --> 22:24.428
on their nuclear engine design.

22:24.511 --> 22:26.680
I have told you before,

22:27.222 --> 22:34.021
if I push too hard,
she will not react well.

22:34.730 --> 22:37.065
You have your instructions.

22:55.751 --> 22:59.505
As most of you know,
I'm Amber's maid of honor, Chelsea.

23:00.380 --> 23:04.384
And-- Sorry. I just--

23:06.220 --> 23:08.430
Amber has always been
my best friend and my protector.

23:08.514 --> 23:09.890
-Champagne?
-Just water. Thanks.

23:09.973 --> 23:11.767
And she was always my hero.

23:11.850 --> 23:14.144
And now she's met her own real-life hero.

23:14.228 --> 23:17.898
An astronaut.
I mean, that is quite a catch. Am I right?

23:18.524 --> 23:19.525
Yep.

23:20.234 --> 23:21.985
When I first met Danny at our church,

23:22.069 --> 23:23.946
I knew he was the one for Amber.

23:24.780 --> 23:26.615
The way he treats her,

23:26.698 --> 23:31.286
and the way he fits in so perfectly
with her family and our congregation,

23:32.496 --> 23:33.956
it's like a fairy tale.

23:35.165 --> 23:37.584
Thank you so much to Karen and Sam,

23:37.668 --> 23:40.671
and everyone else at Polaris
for your hospitality.

23:40.754 --> 23:44.091
Anyways, please join me in raising a glass

23:44.675 --> 23:48.387
to my best friend, my hero, and her hero.

23:49.179 --> 23:52.266
I wish you a lifetime of happiness.
Cheers.

23:52.349 --> 23:53.809
Cheers!

24:04.027 --> 24:05.028
Hello.

24:06.488 --> 24:07.781
Sorry.

24:08.866 --> 24:12.578
I'm Danny's brother. I'm not very good
at this, so I'll keep it short.

24:14.538 --> 24:17.457
Danny, you've always been
a good brother to me.

24:17.541 --> 24:19.418
Especially since you've been sober.

24:23.005 --> 24:26.758
You always know how to make people
feel special, feel important.

24:28.844 --> 24:33.140
I remember how happy Mom and Dad would get
when you came home from Naval Academy.

24:33.223 --> 24:34.933
It was like we were a family again.

24:35.642 --> 24:38.478
Everyone keeps talking about
how happy Mom and Dad were.

24:38.562 --> 24:41.190
But let's be honest. That's horseshit.

24:41.273 --> 24:43.192
'Cause half the time, if they weren't
screaming at each other,

24:43.275 --> 24:45.777
the other half they were
throwing things at each other.

24:47.112 --> 24:52.576
Now they're lovers on the lunar surface.
That's what NASA does.

24:52.659 --> 24:55.495
They twist things
into how they want us to see them.

24:56.788 --> 25:00.292
They died for their country.
They died for the space program.

25:00.375 --> 25:04.546
They died for each other.
But the truth is they just died.

25:05.881 --> 25:06.924
And now they're dead.

25:20.729 --> 25:22.147
Anyways…

25:23.273 --> 25:24.983
this day is about the two of you.

25:25.651 --> 25:30.280
And let's raise a toast to my brother
and his beautiful wife, Amber.

25:32.699 --> 25:34.868
I hope you find the happiness
they never could.

25:37.120 --> 25:38.247
Cheers.

25:39.289 --> 25:40.958
All right. Cheers.

25:41.041 --> 25:42.376
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

26:01.395 --> 26:03.730
-Hello?
-In here!

26:04.523 --> 26:07.401
Javi, I asked you
three times already. Stop.

26:08.735 --> 26:09.903
Sorry I'm late.

26:10.988 --> 26:13.907
I see Javi's been working on his scales.

26:13.991 --> 26:15.158
Tía Margo.

26:22.958 --> 26:24.334
Before dinner?

26:24.418 --> 26:26.670
It's a palate cleanser.

26:26.753 --> 26:29.089
Tootsie. I got a Tootsie!

26:29.923 --> 26:31.091
Hi, Margo.

26:31.175 --> 26:32.176
Hi, Victor.

26:32.259 --> 26:34.344
Now that Senator Wilson
has secured enough votes

26:34.428 --> 26:36.680
to guarantee her
the Republican nomination,

26:37.389 --> 26:39.725
her Democratic rival, Governor Clinton,

26:39.808 --> 26:42.936
criticized her voting record
on family rights planning.

26:43.020 --> 26:47.065
Clinton's long history of support
from low- to middle-income families

26:47.149 --> 26:49.568
continues to gain strength
from his association--

26:49.651 --> 26:50.861
Javi, quiet.

26:50.944 --> 26:53.822
Victor, can you deal with him?
I really need to finish this tonight.

26:53.906 --> 26:55.657
Come here, you little rascal. Come on.

26:57.868 --> 26:59.077
Okay.

27:00.704 --> 27:02.414
Dinner is ready.

27:02.497 --> 27:04.791
What's on the menu this week, Octavio?

27:04.875 --> 27:09.046
It's my specialty, Ms. Madison.
Enchiladas rojas.

27:09.129 --> 27:11.173
Please, everybody, sit.

27:15.135 --> 27:16.637
He put cheese in it again.

27:17.638 --> 27:19.598
Dad, you put cheese in the enchiladas.

27:20.182 --> 27:21.141
Yes.

27:22.017 --> 27:24.436
You know Victor is lactose intolerant.

27:25.187 --> 27:27.940
No, but it's okay. It's just a little bit.

27:28.482 --> 27:30.651
Come on. Everybody likes cheese.

27:31.568 --> 27:32.569
The wine.

27:36.114 --> 27:37.366
He does this on purpose.

27:37.950 --> 27:40.702
No, he doesn't. He just forgets sometimes.

27:40.786 --> 27:41.828
All the time.

27:44.623 --> 27:46.041
Okay.

27:47.501 --> 27:48.877
-Who's hungry?
-Me.

28:09.690 --> 28:11.608
Hey, Jimmy, right?

28:13.610 --> 28:14.903
Lame party, huh?

28:14.987 --> 28:15.988
What's your name?

28:16.655 --> 28:18.031
Isaiah.

28:18.115 --> 28:21.827
Also known as the stepson of the woman
who saved the world with a handshake.

28:22.411 --> 28:23.579
Well, Isaiah,

28:23.662 --> 28:28.292
you wouldn't be interested in escaping
this mind-numbing charade, would you?

28:29.543 --> 28:32.754
Wait. Up here? Seriously? Can we do that?

28:32.838 --> 28:34.214
I have my ways.

28:42.764 --> 28:44.600
I remember it like yesterday,

28:44.683 --> 28:47.311
you coming to my office,
saying you had an idea.

28:50.272 --> 28:52.482
I thought you were gonna
pitch me a new restaurant.

28:53.025 --> 28:54.026
Really?

28:54.109 --> 28:58.155
You said, "Why shouldn't everyone
get to enjoy space?"

28:58.739 --> 29:00.240
Well, except for me.

29:03.660 --> 29:04.703
This is just the beginning.

29:05.454 --> 29:06.830
You're right. It is.

29:08.165 --> 29:11.043
Okay. Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a special surprise for you now.

29:11.668 --> 29:13.587
Please look over at the screen behind you.

29:13.670 --> 29:16.340
We have a message
from a good friend of Danny's.

29:23.931 --> 29:27.267
Hey, Danny, Amber. It's me.

29:28.310 --> 29:30.521
I wish I could be there
with you all to celebrate,

29:30.604 --> 29:33.357
but I'm stuck down here
at the end of the world,

29:33.440 --> 29:34.525
freezing my butt off.

29:35.567 --> 29:37.736
I just wanna say congratulations

29:37.819 --> 29:40.822
and I know you'll have
an amazing life together.

29:40.906 --> 29:43.408
It's almost disgusting
how perfect you are for each other.

29:45.577 --> 29:46.954
And please make sure

29:47.037 --> 29:49.581
my dad doesn't embarrass himself too much
on the dance floor.

29:49.665 --> 29:50.916
Too late.

29:51.917 --> 29:54.294
Come on. It's not that bad.

29:54.378 --> 29:57.172
I love you all. Cheers.

29:58.549 --> 30:01.218
-Yeah.
-So sweet.

30:01.301 --> 30:04.304
Now if everyone would please gather
around the dance floor

30:04.388 --> 30:07.975
to welcome our bride and groom
for their first dance as husband and wife.

30:25.492 --> 30:29.621
You know I can be found

30:33.876 --> 30:37.129
I'm sitting home all alone

30:42.217 --> 30:45.846
If you can't come around

30:50.726 --> 30:53.770
At least on the telephone

30:58.025 --> 30:59.776
Don't be cruel

31:05.115 --> 31:08.368
To a heart that's true

31:15.250 --> 31:18.253
Baby, if I made you mad

31:22.758 --> 31:26.261
With something that I might have said

31:34.603 --> 31:36.522
Don't be cruel

31:47.199 --> 31:48.742
Commander LaPorte,

31:48.825 --> 31:52.204
one of our main orbital thrusters
is performing an uncommanded burn.

31:55.582 --> 31:57.084
It's not responding.

31:59.378 --> 32:02.548
-Kill the power to the valve.
-Tried that. It must be jammed open.

32:03.298 --> 32:06.426
Well, the smaller
rotational thrusters have engaged.

32:06.510 --> 32:09.346
Automatically, the verns might be able
to counter the thrust.

32:09.429 --> 32:11.723
It looks like the valve
is stuck all the way open.

32:11.807 --> 32:13.392
The verns cannot overpower it.

32:13.475 --> 32:15.727
The ship's beginning to rotate faster.

32:16.478 --> 32:18.772
Centrifugal gravity is
starting to rise, Commander.

32:35.789 --> 32:36.832
Oh, no.

32:38.750 --> 32:39.960
I meant to throw it farther.

32:41.712 --> 32:43.130
Oh, my God. I love this song!

32:48.635 --> 32:51.430
Could I get a glass of water? A big one.

32:58.770 --> 32:59.897
She's having a good time.

33:00.939 --> 33:01.940
Yeah.

33:05.819 --> 33:06.820
You bet.

33:08.864 --> 33:10.282
They looked good, didn't they?

33:11.116 --> 33:13.785
Danny and Amber. Out there, dancing.

33:17.164 --> 33:19.166
Never heard that song
played like that before.

33:23.086 --> 33:24.254
You're coming.

33:28.175 --> 33:29.259
You okay?

33:30.511 --> 33:31.887
Yeah, I'm good.

33:33.764 --> 33:34.848
Three, four!

33:38.060 --> 33:40.979
Well, I should probably get
Yvonne back to the room.

33:44.858 --> 33:45.859
Good idea.

33:48.195 --> 33:49.196
Hey.

33:50.781 --> 33:53.992
Congrats on everything.

33:54.076 --> 33:57.955
You know, what you've done here
is pretty incredible.

34:00.707 --> 34:01.708
Thanks, Ed.

34:04.002 --> 34:05.712
-Yvonne.
-Eddy.

34:07.589 --> 34:08.841
-Now?
-Yeah.

34:10.092 --> 34:13.219
-No, I wanna stay. I wanna stay.
-Come on.

34:22.312 --> 34:23.730
Bye, guys.

34:24.356 --> 34:25.649
-Bye-bye.
-Bye!

34:27.234 --> 34:28.235
What?

34:30.320 --> 34:31.321
Bye.

34:32.947 --> 34:34.157
Good night, Ed.

34:36.368 --> 34:37.995
-Right now?
-Yeah.

34:48.297 --> 34:50.716
Commander LaPorte. What's going on?

34:51.300 --> 34:53.177
Could we just step over here for a minute?

34:54.511 --> 34:55.512
Okay.

34:58.056 --> 35:00.601
There is a problem
with the hotel's gravity levels.

35:02.186 --> 35:03.478
Gravity levels?

35:03.562 --> 35:05.397
One of the hotel's
orbital thrusters is stuck on.

35:05.480 --> 35:07.900
We think debris from a North Korean rocket
may have struck it.

35:07.983 --> 35:08.984
Jesus.

35:09.067 --> 35:10.986
NASA sent out a bulletin earlier.

35:11.069 --> 35:13.405
We were supposedly in the clear.

35:13.906 --> 35:17.451
The gravity is at manageable levels now,
but it's rising.

35:17.534 --> 35:18.994
Okay, so what's the plan?

35:19.077 --> 35:22.456
We're going to do an EVA
to manually close the thruster's valve.

35:22.539 --> 35:24.082
A space walk?

35:25.042 --> 35:26.877
Well, can it wait
until the wedding is finished?

35:26.960 --> 35:29.171
No, it can't.

35:30.839 --> 35:32.925
All right. Well, do we alert the guests?

35:33.008 --> 35:35.469
I don't think there's any reason
to concern the guests right now.

35:35.552 --> 35:37.221
I just say we fix the damn thing.

35:40.307 --> 35:41.308
Okay.

35:46.021 --> 35:49.399
Oh, no, no, no, no, Ms. Madison.
You're the guest.

35:58.825 --> 36:01.245
How's our Mars engine looking?

36:01.328 --> 36:02.996
It's getting there.

36:05.040 --> 36:06.333
This is smart.

36:08.043 --> 36:12.256
A niobium alloy nozzle will cool
more effectively in the vacuum of space.

36:12.798 --> 36:15.717
A radiative cooling design
would be optimal.

36:17.219 --> 36:19.388
We just have to make sure
the technicians up there

36:19.471 --> 36:22.391
keep the nozzle wall thickness
within the correct tolerances.

36:23.559 --> 36:24.852
No.

36:24.935 --> 36:27.354
Too much can be lost in translation.

36:27.980 --> 36:30.440
We'll need to send someone
to oversee the repair.

36:31.525 --> 36:32.693
Yeah, good idea.

36:33.235 --> 36:35.445
-Maybe we should send--
-You leave in a week.

36:37.322 --> 36:38.740
What do you mean?

36:39.867 --> 36:40.868
What?

36:44.746 --> 36:46.498
-You mean you want me to--
-Yeah.

36:59.386 --> 37:01.054
Papa, Papa.

37:03.140 --> 37:04.141
Everything is okay?

37:06.977 --> 37:08.061
I'm going to the moon.

37:12.024 --> 37:13.192
You…

37:21.575 --> 37:23.035
My little one.

39:28.577 --> 39:32.206
See? What'd I tell you?
My mom taught me this trick.

39:44.259 --> 39:45.719
You sure you've done this before?

39:46.220 --> 39:47.262
Yeah. All the time.

39:51.391 --> 39:52.392
So…

39:53.727 --> 39:55.604
how's it being an astronaut's kid so far?

39:55.687 --> 39:57.022
It's okay.

39:57.981 --> 40:00.359
My dad seems happy, so that's good.

40:01.985 --> 40:05.239
He actually says
that she reminds him a lot of my mom.

40:05.822 --> 40:06.907
My real mom.

40:08.534 --> 40:09.535
She…

40:10.327 --> 40:11.578
died when I was little.

40:15.999 --> 40:17.000
I actually…

40:18.710 --> 40:20.504
don't remember her all that well.

40:25.467 --> 40:26.468
Yeah.

40:44.903 --> 40:46.196
Exiting air lock.

40:49.491 --> 40:50.993
Attaching tethers.

40:53.662 --> 40:56.415
About to begin rappelling down the spoke
towards the thruster.

40:56.957 --> 40:58.333
Slow and steady.

40:58.917 --> 40:59.918
Watch your footing.

41:00.460 --> 41:01.753
Copy, Skipper.

41:02.629 --> 41:04.798
Caution and warnings clear.
DCM looks good.

41:04.882 --> 41:05.883
Copy.

41:07.676 --> 41:09.094
Beginning descent.

41:11.263 --> 41:13.932
140 feet from outer ring.

41:45.255 --> 41:46.256
Wait.

41:49.218 --> 41:51.887
You didn't have to come,
but you said you wanted to.

41:51.970 --> 41:54.473
So it's all my fault again, as usual.

41:54.556 --> 41:55.974
Would you just stop?

41:56.058 --> 41:58.685
You're embarrassed of me, aren't you?

41:58.769 --> 42:00.562
When you act like this, can you blame me?

42:21.792 --> 42:23.168
Are you okay?

42:38.100 --> 42:41.895
Honey, have you seen Isaiah?

42:41.979 --> 42:43.272
I haven't. Why?

42:45.732 --> 42:47.067
There's something going on.

42:49.069 --> 42:51.029
50 feet from the outer ring now.

42:51.113 --> 42:52.114
Good.

42:52.781 --> 42:54.575
Remember, when you get close
to the edge of the ring,

42:54.658 --> 42:56.118
stay clear of the vern thrusters.

42:56.618 --> 42:57.870
They'll sneak up on you.

42:58.453 --> 42:59.621
Copy.

43:00.831 --> 43:02.332
I can see the primary thruster.

43:04.126 --> 43:05.335
Hey, do you see that?

43:05.419 --> 43:08.338
Yeah, the coupling is shaking.

43:09.673 --> 43:12.718
One of the stabilizer cables is vibrating.

43:13.719 --> 43:16.180
Yeah. I think it's coming loose.

43:16.263 --> 43:18.390
Abort the repair.
Return to the hatch immediately.

43:18.473 --> 43:20.309
Watch out! The cable just broke off.

43:22.644 --> 43:24.146
-What is it?
-You feel that?

43:24.646 --> 43:26.356
-Come on.
-No, no. I'm serious.

43:27.816 --> 43:29.526
We're spinning faster.

43:29.610 --> 43:31.820
Look out.
The cable's coming right towards us.

43:40.495 --> 43:43.540
Cy, Joaquin. Do you read?

43:43.624 --> 43:45.542
Sir, both suits showing
major loss of integrity.

43:45.626 --> 43:46.835
They're losing pressure fast.

43:46.919 --> 43:49.254
-Has he engaged OPS?
-Negative.

43:49.338 --> 43:51.423
Cable four backup system
is not responding.

43:51.507 --> 43:53.425
Negative EKG, negative respiration.

43:53.509 --> 43:55.719
I need a system-wide check
of all flight backup ops now.

43:59.848 --> 44:01.683
Another support cable has snapped.

44:02.226 --> 44:04.144
Attempting manual power lockdown.

44:04.770 --> 44:06.480
Manual override will not respond.

44:30.671 --> 44:31.880
Oh, my God.

44:33.298 --> 44:35.092
Oh, my God. Ed?

44:35.676 --> 44:37.511
Holy shit. Come on. Let's get outta here!

44:40.138 --> 44:42.891
-Holy shit! Come on! We gotta get out!
-Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

44:42.975 --> 44:44.142
No! Come on! Leave it!

44:44.226 --> 44:45.769
Come on! Come on!

44:48.856 --> 44:50.649
Oh, no! Oh, my God!

44:50.732 --> 44:51.900
Come on!

44:53.944 --> 44:55.571
We've got a depress event in module 7.

44:55.654 --> 44:58.115
Commander, we're also getting a report

44:58.198 --> 45:00.576
-of losing pressure in module 6.
-Activate hull breach backup systems.

45:00.659 --> 45:01.994
Jesus Christ.

45:03.912 --> 45:04.913
What'd you do?

45:04.997 --> 45:06.164
Nothing.

45:11.879 --> 45:13.338
Must be a bad thruster.

45:15.132 --> 45:16.800
Module 8 is starting to lose pressure.

45:16.884 --> 45:18.468
Double the ppO2 in module 8.

45:18.552 --> 45:20.971
We've still got people in there
that need to breathe.

45:21.054 --> 45:23.265
And get a new DC crew in there right now.

45:23.348 --> 45:26.059
Aye, aye, Commander.
Damage control to module 8.

45:26.143 --> 45:28.520
Depress alarm protocols
have sealed off the quadrant.

45:28.604 --> 45:32.024
Thrusters are still firing,
and gravity is at just under two G's.

45:32.107 --> 45:33.692
Is there some other way to turn it off?

45:33.775 --> 45:36.153
That cable's still whipping around.
It's too dangerous.

45:37.070 --> 45:40.032
This ship isn't built to withstand
centrifugal force greater than four G's.

45:41.658 --> 45:43.368
What happens at four G's?

45:44.870 --> 45:46.705
It will come apart.

45:46.788 --> 45:49.166
Hull breach. Integrity at -2.1.

45:49.249 --> 45:50.626
Life support systems still nominal.

45:50.709 --> 45:53.170
-There is CO2 buildup in compartment 7.
-Okay.

45:53.253 --> 45:56.089
We need to evacuate.
Let's get everyone to the shuttles.

46:02.221 --> 46:05.724
In a moment I'm gonna ask us all
to head calmly towards the exit,

46:05.807 --> 46:08.560
where we will be making our way
down to the elevators

46:08.644 --> 46:12.856
and up to the central hub of the hotel,
where there is still zero gravity.

46:12.940 --> 46:16.360
Then we will be boarding the shuttles
back to Houston.

46:16.443 --> 46:19.738
This is only a precautionary measure,
okay?

46:19.821 --> 46:23.200
I just need us all to please listen
to all crew members' instructions

46:23.283 --> 46:26.286
because your safety
is our number one concern.

46:26.370 --> 46:28.121
I'll be taking the older folks first.

46:28.205 --> 46:29.373
-You two.
-Okay.

46:29.456 --> 46:30.457
-Yeah.
-Okay.

46:30.541 --> 46:31.792
You doing okay, sir?

46:31.875 --> 46:33.961
-You okay?
-Here they are.

46:34.044 --> 46:35.504
Come on, boy.

46:36.421 --> 46:38.757
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay. It's all right.

46:38.841 --> 46:41.969
Listen, we're getting out of here.
All right? Stick with me. Both of you.

46:42.052 --> 46:43.095
-Come on. Let's go.
-Come on.

46:45.347 --> 46:46.598
Single-file.

46:54.022 --> 46:55.107
-Danny!
-You okay?

46:55.190 --> 46:56.191
No.

46:56.275 --> 46:57.276
What happened?

46:57.359 --> 46:59.111
It's a fracture. Come on.

47:00.612 --> 47:02.155
-We gotta be close to two G's now.
-Yeah.

47:02.239 --> 47:04.658
-What's going on?
-Ship's rotating too fast.

47:04.741 --> 47:06.326
We need to get on the elevator.

47:19.047 --> 47:22.551
Listen, everybody who's feeling
the adverse reactions to the gravity,

47:22.634 --> 47:24.303
board the elevator in the next group.

47:25.637 --> 47:27.806
All right, Sam.
We're ready with the next group.

47:28.307 --> 47:31.143
Okay. This group's off-loaded.
I'm heading back down in the elevator.

47:31.226 --> 47:32.227
All right.

47:32.311 --> 47:33.729
-Hey, you okay?
-Yeah.

47:36.523 --> 47:37.524
Is she okay?

47:37.608 --> 47:39.276
-Yeah. She will be.
-Okay.

47:40.235 --> 47:41.278
Here it comes.

47:53.081 --> 47:54.666
Get back! Everyone, get back!

47:59.755 --> 48:01.757
The elevator
in quadrant 3 just went off-line.

48:01.840 --> 48:02.925
What do you mean "off-line"?

48:03.008 --> 48:05.010
Its sensors just stopped
transmitting suddenly.

48:05.093 --> 48:06.512
Hold all other elevators.

48:08.972 --> 48:12.518
Hey, Sam. Can you hear me?
Sam, can you hear me?

48:15.854 --> 48:16.897
Hey!

48:16.980 --> 48:18.148
Sam?

48:19.274 --> 48:20.275
Sam?

48:21.109 --> 48:22.110
Sam?

48:27.616 --> 48:28.617
Sam?

48:32.746 --> 48:33.872
Oh, my…

48:39.002 --> 48:40.003
Okay.

48:41.213 --> 48:42.756
Okay. Okay.

48:45.676 --> 48:46.802
Okay.

48:54.852 --> 48:57.813
Attention. Do not use the elevators.

48:58.814 --> 49:02.484
I repeat, do not use the elevators.

49:02.985 --> 49:04.653
Karen. Karen, are you okay?

49:04.736 --> 49:07.364
Danny. Thank God.
Hey, is Ed there with you?

49:07.447 --> 49:09.157
Yeah. Yeah, they're here.

49:09.241 --> 49:11.910
Okay. Whatever you do,
do not use the elevator.

49:11.994 --> 49:14.997
You're gonna have to use the access shaft.
It's to the right of the door.

49:15.080 --> 49:17.499
It goes all the way to the center hub.

49:17.583 --> 49:19.835
Karen, what the hell is going on?

49:19.918 --> 49:23.589
They tried to go out and fix the thruster,
two of our crew, but they…

49:24.756 --> 49:28.302
they were killed. And then Sam-- Sam--

49:28.385 --> 49:31.054
Look, we have to evacuate, okay?
I'm so sorry.

49:31.138 --> 49:32.139
All right.

49:32.848 --> 49:34.099
Let's go.

49:34.183 --> 49:36.268
I'll see you up there, okay, Karen?

49:38.687 --> 49:40.147
Oh, my God.

49:42.232 --> 49:43.525
Oh, my God. I can't breathe.

49:44.484 --> 49:46.069
My chest. I'm gonna be sick.

49:46.820 --> 49:49.948
It's just the gravity. Take deep breaths.

49:50.866 --> 49:51.867
Take deep breaths.

49:51.950 --> 49:52.951
Okay.

49:55.204 --> 49:58.415
I'm not gonna be able to make it up there.
Not with this leg.

49:59.208 --> 50:00.709
Y'all need to go on without me.

50:00.792 --> 50:02.002
-No.
-No.

50:02.085 --> 50:03.545
They're not gonna make it up either.

50:04.087 --> 50:05.422
We're at double gravity.

50:05.506 --> 50:08.759
It'll be like climbing a ladder
with another person on your back.

50:12.971 --> 50:14.556
There are pressure suits in the shuttle.

50:14.640 --> 50:16.433
If I can get to 'em,
I can make it to the thruster.

50:16.517 --> 50:17.851
Even if you make it out there,

50:17.935 --> 50:21.146
the gravity around the edge of that ring
will fling you off like a rag doll.

50:21.230 --> 50:22.773
It's too dangerous.

50:23.732 --> 50:25.067
What other choice do we have?

50:25.943 --> 50:28.695
No. No, you can't.

50:29.363 --> 50:30.322
It'll be okay.

50:32.616 --> 50:33.825
Stay with Ed.

50:43.460 --> 50:44.670
Godspeed.

51:24.668 --> 51:27.963
We're losing structural
integrity along the outer rim, Commander.

51:28.547 --> 51:31.592
We might not even make it to four G's
before this place comes apart.

51:37.639 --> 51:38.640
Wait.

51:39.224 --> 51:43.103
Skipper, we've got an air lock open
at the shuttle docking port.

51:48.692 --> 51:50.110
There's someone out there.

52:44.998 --> 52:46.124
Oh, shi--
