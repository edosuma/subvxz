39:11.650 --> 39:13.983
Never go away again.

39:13.985 --> 39:17.153
[ Gasps ] Craig, Craig,
Craig, Craig!

39:17.155 --> 39:21.057
Hey, little dude!
Oh, my gosh, I have missed you.

39:23.128 --> 39:26.229
We believe this family can
work out something beneficial

39:26.231 --> 39:27.964
for this boy's future.

39:27.966 --> 39:29.532
You believe rightly, sir.

39:29.534 --> 39:31.835
You believe rightly,
and thank you.

39:31.837 --> 39:34.037
It's our pleasure, sir.
The LAPD only wishes

39:34.039 --> 39:36.106
we could spend more time
reuniting fathers

39:36.108 --> 39:37.674
with their sons.

39:46.752 --> 39:50.053
In some ways, it's something
I've always dreamed of.

39:50.055 --> 39:52.322
An affordable home
in the Hollywood Hills

39:52.324 --> 39:54.791
with a pool and a family
to share it with.

39:54.793 --> 39:57.660
It's even more inviting
than in the video.

39:57.662 --> 40:00.029
Right? I mean, it's so light
and cozy, isn't it?

40:00.031 --> 40:03.400
Absolutely, and it is
so well-maintained.

40:03.402 --> 40:05.502
I can see why you like it
so much.

40:05.504 --> 40:07.904
It has...a lot of potential.

40:07.906 --> 40:10.373
So, have there been a lot
of people to see the home

40:10.375 --> 40:13.410
since you took over as agent?
Well, a property this special

40:13.412 --> 40:16.513
will always generate
a ton of interest.

40:18.083 --> 40:19.516
[ Laughing ]

40:19.518 --> 40:22.018
Look at me,
lying to the police.

40:22.020 --> 40:25.455
No. Ever since your friend
told the world

40:25.457 --> 40:27.524
that this place was
the Monkey's Paw

40:27.526 --> 40:30.059
of local listings,
even the Jehovah's Witnesses

40:30.061 --> 40:31.561
wouldn't knock on this door.

40:31.563 --> 40:33.363
It's yours for the taking.
How do you like that?

40:33.365 --> 40:35.432
For the first time in my life,
Provenza has brought me

40:35.434 --> 40:37.600
a little good luck.
There is just this --

40:37.602 --> 40:40.069
this one thing I'm obligated
to disclose.

40:40.071 --> 40:41.571
Um... [ Clears throat ]

40:41.573 --> 40:43.106
With all the furnishings
going in and out, we noticed

40:43.108 --> 40:45.975
that there were several
surfaces here hiding --

40:45.977 --> 40:48.445
Well, I guess there's
no other way to say it.

40:48.447 --> 40:50.547
Um... [ Clears throat ]
Black mold.

40:50.549 --> 40:52.115
What?
I'm hope that's not --

40:52.117 --> 40:53.917
Toxic mold?
Are you kidding me?
Black mold?

40:53.919 --> 40:55.952
But -- but -- but while
I admit that the words

40:55.954 --> 40:58.922
"toxic mold" sound bad...
Oh, you think?

40:58.924 --> 41:00.990
But...this is such
an opportunity.

41:00.992 --> 41:03.293
An opportunity in what way?
Come on, now,

41:03.295 --> 41:04.727
wouldn't you just
love to rip down

41:04.729 --> 41:06.629
these old walls to the studs

41:06.631 --> 41:10.266
and remold these rooms
into the house of your dreams?

41:10.268 --> 41:12.569
I mean, with
the purchase price...
Andy, I've heard enough.

41:12.571 --> 41:14.270
...the money that you would
save, and the taxes --

41:14.272 --> 41:16.539
-But wait a minute --
-I had to say his name.

41:16.541 --> 41:19.976
I had to say "Provenza."
I had to say it.

41:19.978 --> 41:21.644
Rusty!
Coming!

41:21.646 --> 41:24.013
Wait a minute, hold on!
Lieutenant!

41:24.015 --> 41:26.216
Andy! There is a deal
to be made here.

41:26.218 --> 41:29.953
Trust me, if there was
a deal to be made here,

41:29.955 --> 41:32.222
my mother
would have made it.

41:34.559 --> 41:36.626
But... [ Stammers ]
[ Door slams ]
