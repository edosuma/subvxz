00:28.962 --> 00:30.589
This picture,

00:30.630 --> 00:33.394
truly one of the most
unusual ever filmed,

00:33.433 --> 00:37.028
contains scenes which
under no circumstances

00:37.070 --> 00:39.800
should be viewed by anyone
with a heart condition

00:39.839 --> 00:42.433
or anyone who is easily upset.

00:42.475 --> 00:44.500
We urgently recommend

00:44.544 --> 00:47.377
that if you are such a person
or the parent

00:47.413 --> 00:50.746
of a young or impressionable child
now in attendance,

00:50.783 --> 00:54.514
that you and the child
leave the auditorium.

00:55.134 --> 00:57.125
<i>* Yeah</i>

01:03.343 --> 01:07.211
<i>* Louie Louie, whoa baby</i>

01:07.247 --> 01:09.681
<i>* I gotta go now</i>

01:11.551 --> 01:15.317
<i>* Louie Louie, whoa baby</i>

01:15.355 --> 01:17.880
<i>* I really gotta go now</i>

01:19.726 --> 01:23.526
<i>* The Communist world
is fallin' apart</i>

01:23.563 --> 01:28.023
<i>* The capitalists
are just breakin' hearts</i>

01:28.068 --> 01:31.469
<i>* Money is the reason to be</i>

01:31.505 --> 01:36.169
<i>* It makes me just
wanna sing Louie Louie</i>

01:36.209 --> 01:39.872
<i>* Louie Louie, whoa baby</i>

01:39.913 --> 01:42.404

01:44.317 --> 01:47.912

01:50.323 --> 01:54.851

01:54.895 --> 01:58.262
<i>* Now you see it,
now you don't</i>

01:58.298 --> 02:02.792
<i>* We spent all our money
on a disaster movie</i>

02:02.836 --> 02:06.567
<i>* It makes me wanna sing
Louie Louie</i>

02:06.606 --> 02:10.508
<i>* Louie Louie, whoa baby</i>

02:10.544 --> 02:13.377
<i>* I gotta go now</i>

02:14.514 --> 02:18.450
<i>* Louie Louie, whoa baby</i>

02:18.485 --> 02:20.749
<i>* I really gotta go now</i>

02:20.787 --> 02:22.880
<i>* Oh, let's give it
to 'em right now.</i>

02:42.328 --> 02:45.024
Rome was the largest
and the most beautiful city

02:45.064 --> 02:47.532
of the ancient world.

02:47.567 --> 02:49.967
The magnificent facade
of the empire, however,

02:50.002 --> 02:53.403
could not conceal
the seeds of decay,

02:53.439 --> 02:57.273
the unhealthy dependence
of the economy on slaves,

02:57.310 --> 03:00.507
the disparity between
rich and poor.

03:00.546 --> 03:02.411
Behind the splendor
of the Forum

03:02.448 --> 03:05.508
were vast areas
of crowded slums.

03:05.551 --> 03:09.885
Escape from the slums was difficult
for there were few jobs available

03:09.922 --> 03:12.390
and practically none
for the unskilled.

03:12.425 --> 03:15.758
To keep idle citizens entertained
and out of mischief,

03:15.795 --> 03:19.856
frequent games and spectacles
were held at public expense.

03:19.899 --> 03:23.062
At first, only chariot races
were sponsored.

03:23.102 --> 03:24.899
But by the reign of Trajan,

03:24.937 --> 03:28.065
brutal combat to the death
had become popular.

03:28.107 --> 03:30.166
Earlier in Rome's history,

03:30.209 --> 03:33.076
elected representatives
exercised the power.

03:33.112 --> 03:35.512
But by now,
every function of government

03:35.548 --> 03:37.573
had been absorbed
by the emperor

03:37.617 --> 03:40.643
who was above the law
and ruled by decree.

03:40.686 --> 03:43.621
That a people as civilized
as the Romans,

03:43.656 --> 03:46.648
with the most humane
system of law ever devised,

03:46.692 --> 03:49.024
could tolerate the violation
of human beings

03:49.061 --> 03:50.995
is astonishing.

03:51.030 --> 03:53.794
This imbalance
and the irresponsible behavior

03:53.833 --> 03:56.859
of public officials
would become major reasons

03:56.903 --> 03:59.770
for Rome's eventual decline.

04:01.841 --> 04:05.709
I wonder how future civilizations
will view our society.

04:05.745 --> 04:07.610
Will they judge us by this?

04:07.701 --> 04:09.611
<i>* He's a cat flushin' a toilet...</i>

04:09.715 --> 04:13.674
<i>* He's a cat flushin' a toilet,
he's a cat flushin' a toilet.</i>

04:13.719 --> 04:15.846
<i>* He's a cat flushin' a toilet.</i>

04:18.491 --> 04:22.128
Or will they judge us by this?

04:32.572 --> 04:34.437
Do you see the sheriff's car?

04:34.474 --> 04:37.500
Yeah, right there.
The sheriff-- that's the first car.

04:37.543 --> 04:39.909
- No--
- There he is.

04:54.961 --> 04:57.862
3, 4, 5, 6...

04:57.897 --> 04:59.888
7.

05:08.341 --> 05:10.400
- Give me the phone.
- It's on this--

05:10.443 --> 05:13.640
it's on the c--
it's on the couch.

05:13.679 --> 05:17.171
All right, that's as close
as I can get, Dad.

05:21.954 --> 05:24.452
Don't stand in front of the door, Dad.

05:24.790 --> 05:27.122
Get out from the--

05:27.159 --> 05:29.684
Hey, Sheriff, Robert
inside the house here.

05:32.498 --> 05:35.092
They're trying to beat
the back door in, Dad.

05:36.669 --> 05:39.399
There are 4 of us in here.
They're beating on the door.

05:39.438 --> 05:42.066
We're not gonna resist,
but you will have to come

05:42.108 --> 05:44.076
in the house on your own.

05:44.110 --> 05:46.374
But there are 4 souls
in this house.

05:50.149 --> 05:52.276
Dad, don't stand
in front of the door.

05:52.318 --> 05:53.686
Do not.

06:01.327 --> 06:03.318
Another witness.

06:03.362 --> 06:04.886
Tell your name to the camera.

06:04.931 --> 06:08.992
- I'm David Phillips.
- Chris Collins.

06:09.035 --> 06:11.401
And Audra Collins.

06:16.375 --> 06:18.139
And this is America?

06:18.678 --> 06:21.943
This is America, folks,
what you're watching right here.

06:32.992 --> 06:35.517
- Sheriff's office.
- Yeah, we know.

06:35.561 --> 06:40.123
- Okay, y'all have to come out, please.
- All right.

06:40.166 --> 06:44.660
We cannot act like this--
this is just something that's okay.

06:44.704 --> 06:46.672
And so this is new.

06:46.706 --> 06:49.573
They've never come out
and boarded up our house

06:49.609 --> 06:51.372
after they've evicted the person

06:51.410 --> 06:53.970
and threw their furniture
in the dumpster.

06:54.013 --> 06:56.038
So they're letting us know

06:56.082 --> 06:59.609
that they are stepping it up,

06:59.652 --> 07:01.984
boarding up somebody's house.

07:02.021 --> 07:04.080
This has been my family home.
This is my parents' house.

07:04.123 --> 07:06.353
I've lived here for 41 years.

07:08.961 --> 07:11.327
This is the only home
I've ever really lived in.

07:11.364 --> 07:14.162
This is the only-- this will always
be home to me, no matter what.

07:14.200 --> 07:15.929
- I'm a carpenter.
- There you go.

07:15.968 --> 07:18.095
Sandra, they're leaving.
Let them leave.

07:18.137 --> 07:20.662
- I'm a carpenter. So what?
- That's all I am.

07:23.175 --> 07:25.939
- Well, people pay their bills.
- This could happen to you.

07:25.978 --> 07:28.469
That's right.
So why do you think I'm doing it?

07:28.514 --> 07:30.641
I don't have to be happy about this,
but that's what I do.

07:30.683 --> 07:33.550
That's all I'm saying is that
maybe you can make another choice.

07:33.586 --> 07:36.180
- That's all we're saying.
- That's no reason for...

07:36.222 --> 07:37.780
You're a working-class person.

07:37.823 --> 07:40.849
people here to get upset
and almost get themselves hurt.

07:40.893 --> 07:43.623
We ain't gonna get hurt.

07:43.663 --> 07:45.187
Are you threatening us?

07:45.231 --> 07:48.029
Y'all gonna get on out of here.
You might end up even getting hurt.

07:48.067 --> 07:50.934
Talking about us getting hurt,
you might get hurt.

07:50.970 --> 07:53.097
There's gonna be
some kind of a rebellion

07:53.139 --> 07:56.165
between the people
that have nothing

07:56.208 --> 07:59.575
and the people that's got it all.

07:59.612 --> 08:01.136
I don't understand.

08:01.180 --> 08:03.080
There's no in-between no more.

08:03.115 --> 08:05.208
There's the people that's got it all

08:05.251 --> 08:07.151
and the people that have nothing.

08:10.022 --> 08:12.616
We gotta get this stuff
out of the house and packed up

08:12.658 --> 08:15.525
and be out of here
in about 30 days

08:15.561 --> 08:17.893
even though we don't
have a place to go.

08:24.403 --> 08:26.496
We designed this house.

08:26.539 --> 08:30.566
The property that it's on
was my family farm.

08:32.845 --> 08:37.839
So I've lost a piece
of my heritage with this.

08:37.883 --> 08:41.614
Why do you do this
to the hard-working people?

08:46.926 --> 08:50.293
Why do you take everything?

08:50.329 --> 08:53.196
You take everything
away from them.

08:53.232 --> 08:56.531
We're just middle-class,
hard-working people

08:56.569 --> 08:58.662
trying to make a living.

09:01.273 --> 09:04.140
Just trying to survive.

09:07.680 --> 09:09.773
An old Browning.

09:12.350 --> 09:14.012
My pistol,

09:14.053 --> 09:17.750
my dad's pistol, my pistol.

09:20.525 --> 09:22.185
Sheriff's department.

09:22.228 --> 09:24.423
It's supposed to be 30 days.

09:24.463 --> 09:26.556
I got 30 days to get my stuff out.

09:26.599 --> 09:29.159
- That's what the guy told me.
- No.

09:29.201 --> 09:31.169
What?

09:31.203 --> 09:34.036
It's currently scheduled for today.

09:34.073 --> 09:35.597
But...

09:35.641 --> 09:37.939
The paper's telling us
that we are due

09:37.977 --> 09:41.378
to do an eviction here
today at 9:00 AM.

09:41.913 --> 09:43.438
Shoot.

09:44.717 --> 09:47.481
Well, he's surprised too.

09:47.520 --> 09:49.681
The house is gone.

09:49.722 --> 09:51.246
That cop told me that the house

09:51.290 --> 09:53.554
has already been sold
to somebody else.

09:53.592 --> 09:56.789
So we don't own the house no more,
somebody else does.

09:58.130 --> 10:01.099
This is capitalism,

10:01.133 --> 10:04.762
a system of taking and giving--

10:04.804 --> 10:07.329
mostly taking.

10:07.373 --> 10:09.273
The only thing we didn't know

10:09.308 --> 10:12.505
was when the revolt would begin.

10:12.545 --> 10:14.706
Everything, we've tried everything...

10:14.747 --> 10:16.374
except robbing a bank.

10:16.415 --> 10:19.043
I'm thinking about
maybe doing that.

10:19.084 --> 10:22.918
You know, that's one way
somebody could get their money back.

10:22.955 --> 10:25.014
If they did it--
they did it to me,

10:25.057 --> 10:27.526
I don't know why
I can't do it to them.

10:31.463 --> 10:33.658
This is my second Hyundai Sonata.

10:33.699 --> 10:35.166
I'll probably get a new car next year.

10:35.201 --> 10:36.930
And when I do,
it'll probably be another Sonata.

10:36.969 --> 10:38.527
You know, I'm not a car guy.

10:38.571 --> 10:40.334
If I can go in there
and steal a condo

10:40.372 --> 10:42.863
for the equivalent of what
a Mercedes would cost

10:42.908 --> 10:45.376
or a Bentley would cost,
I'm all about that.

10:46.378 --> 10:48.278
Meet Peter Zalewski,

10:48.314 --> 10:50.680
Florida's up-and-coming
real estate whiz.

10:50.716 --> 10:52.240
Here we go.

10:52.284 --> 10:55.845
He calls his real estate company
Condo Vultures.

10:55.888 --> 10:57.549
We have a very good sign.

10:57.590 --> 10:59.114
You have the final notice
of eviction.

10:59.158 --> 11:01.149
So you can see this person
was basically thrown out

11:01.193 --> 11:03.024
by the police department.

11:03.062 --> 11:04.996
Welcome.

11:06.298 --> 11:07.925
Peter deals exclusively

11:07.967 --> 11:10.231
with clients who buy up
foreclosed homes

11:10.269 --> 11:12.703
and then resell them at a profit.

11:12.738 --> 11:15.366
It's gonna be about
830 square feet or so...

11:15.407 --> 11:17.534
At the end of the day,
the only people who are buying

11:17.576 --> 11:19.635
are primarily individuals
that we represent...

11:19.678 --> 11:22.146
Today it's on the market
for $66,000.

11:22.181 --> 11:24.445
...which are basically bottom feeders
who are going in there.

11:24.483 --> 11:26.348
They have no compassion,
no sensitivity.

11:26.385 --> 11:29.149
They're running purely off numbers
They're coming in all cash,

11:29.188 --> 11:31.588
and they're looking to slit
any single seller's throat

11:31.624 --> 11:33.717
regardless of what
their situation is.

11:33.759 --> 11:36.057
So people always ask,
"What's 25¢ on the dollar?"

11:36.095 --> 11:37.858
This is it.
This is what you're gonna get.

11:37.897 --> 11:41.094
The vulture basically represents
a bottom feeder

11:41.133 --> 11:44.398
that goes in there
and cleans off a carcass.

11:44.436 --> 11:46.961
Because they're dealing with
so many different germs and situations,

11:47.006 --> 11:49.304
they'll have to vomit on themselves
and there's some sort

11:49.341 --> 11:51.275
of cleansing process that occurs.

11:51.310 --> 11:53.175
The vultures
aren't actually killing,

11:53.212 --> 11:54.975
they're the ones
doing the clean-up.

11:55.014 --> 11:56.504
Which bank you want?
Bank of America?

11:56.548 --> 11:58.413
What we do is we tap into data...

11:58.450 --> 12:00.042
and boom, voila.

12:00.085 --> 12:03.452
Here we got 3,400 foreclosing
by Bank of America.

12:03.489 --> 12:04.956
Gotta love it.

12:04.990 --> 12:07.515
As we collect data,
it's giving us

12:07.559 --> 12:10.289
the insight into the battlefield,

12:10.329 --> 12:13.696
almost like a drone that flies
over the battleground in Afghanistan

12:13.732 --> 12:16.701
or in Pakistan or in Iraq.

12:16.735 --> 12:18.896
The current asking price is 355.

12:18.938 --> 12:20.997
Again, it was purchased for 840.

12:21.040 --> 12:23.338
A little bit of a discount.
You're gonna have 2...

12:23.375 --> 12:25.468
Our people are using
that data to be able to go in

12:25.511 --> 12:28.503
and try to steal properties,
legally and ethically,

12:28.547 --> 12:30.572
but take them at the bare-bone
bottom price.

12:30.616 --> 12:32.584
It's all about taking right now.

12:32.618 --> 12:35.519
Look at the-- look at the roof--
completely gone and missing.

12:35.554 --> 12:38.022
We haven't had a hurricane
in 5 years.

12:40.125 --> 12:42.650
Welcome to the housing crash,
Miami style.

12:42.695 --> 12:44.390
So this-- this is what capitalism is

12:44.430 --> 12:46.591
and this is why the information
is so critical.

12:46.632 --> 12:48.190
We go in there,
we alert them to it,

12:48.233 --> 12:49.723
and if they like it, you know--

12:51.770 --> 12:53.203
- Look at the window.
- Look at that.

12:53.238 --> 12:55.001
Looks like the house
next door was on fire.

12:55.040 --> 12:56.905
This is straight up capitalism.

12:56.942 --> 12:59.433
- Fire damage.
- I wonder if somebody was living there...

12:59.478 --> 13:01.469
Everybody's got
this desire to go in there

13:01.513 --> 13:03.947
and take advantage
of others' misfortunes.

13:03.983 --> 13:05.109
Somebody asked me,

13:05.150 --> 13:07.311
"What's the difference between
you and a real vulture?"

13:07.353 --> 13:10.186
I said, "It's very simple.
I don't vomit on myself."

13:12.558 --> 13:15.618
Our topic today:
What is capitalism?

13:15.661 --> 13:16.821
Capitalism?

13:16.862 --> 13:19.330
Well, why should there be
any question about it?

13:19.365 --> 13:22.823
Hasn't it given us the highest
standard of living in the world?

13:22.868 --> 13:25.598
We're free to try to make a profit,

13:25.637 --> 13:27.935
to just get by, or to fail.

13:27.973 --> 13:29.964
That's what capitalism is:

13:30.009 --> 13:32.500
a system of free enterprise.

13:32.544 --> 13:34.842
Now tell us what
"free enterprise" means.

13:36.115 --> 13:38.515
I went to see
my friend Wally Shawn,

13:38.550 --> 13:40.745
a playwright
and sometimes actor.

13:40.786 --> 13:42.310
Inconceivable!

13:42.354 --> 13:45.585
But Wally also studied
history and politics

13:45.624 --> 13:48.491
and even a little
elementary economics.

13:48.527 --> 13:52.793
Free enterprise
is a form of words

13:52.831 --> 13:55.561
that is intended
to conjure up in your mind

13:55.601 --> 14:00.538
a little town with different shops.

14:00.572 --> 14:03.507
And the guy who runs
the best shop

14:03.542 --> 14:06.033
has the most customers.

14:06.078 --> 14:08.478
There is the basis
of the capitalistic system:

14:08.514 --> 14:10.106
the profit motive.

14:10.149 --> 14:12.982
He's in business to make money.

14:13.018 --> 14:15.486
The original theory of capitalism

14:15.521 --> 14:18.513
is that it's a very clever way

14:18.557 --> 14:22.926
of society voting on what goods

14:22.961 --> 14:25.361
it wants made.

14:25.397 --> 14:27.228
What do you use this for?

14:27.266 --> 14:31.100
That's-- I could use that
for practically everything I ever do.

14:31.136 --> 14:34.799
You know, society votes.

14:34.840 --> 14:37.104
They like the way this guy

14:37.142 --> 14:39.838
makes ice cream.

14:39.878 --> 14:41.505
But the other guy,

14:41.547 --> 14:44.880
they don't like
his ice cream that much

14:44.917 --> 14:49.786
and they don't buy it,
so it fades out.

14:49.822 --> 14:52.450
It's on me.
That is a good fit.

14:52.491 --> 14:56.825
The basic law of life
is that if you have things,

14:56.862 --> 15:00.229
you can easily get more things.

15:00.265 --> 15:03.257
Very quickly, one guy can have

15:03.302 --> 15:05.998
5 times more
than anybody else.

15:06.038 --> 15:08.438
- Free enterprise.
- Competition.

15:08.474 --> 15:09.941
The profit motive.

15:11.944 --> 15:14.845
My dad, an assembly-line
worker at General Motors,

15:14.880 --> 15:16.541
bought and paid for our house

15:16.582 --> 15:20.245
before I graduated
from kindergarten.

15:20.285 --> 15:23.413
We had a new car
every 3 years.

15:25.457 --> 15:28.290
We went to New York
every other summer.

15:28.327 --> 15:31.296
That's me on Wall Street.

15:31.330 --> 15:33.230
And that's me
directing my first movie

15:33.265 --> 15:34.789
at the World's Fair.

15:34.833 --> 15:38.860
We went to Catholic schools,
we lived a good life.

15:40.639 --> 15:43.972
If this was capitalism,
I loved it...

15:44.009 --> 15:46.477
and so did everyone else.

15:46.512 --> 15:50.505
During these years
a lot of people got rich

15:50.549 --> 15:54.542
and they had to pay
a top tax rate of 90%.

15:54.586 --> 15:56.679
90%?

15:56.722 --> 15:58.553
Yep.

15:58.590 --> 16:03.152
But they still got to live
like Bogie and Bacall.

16:03.195 --> 16:05.527
And what did we do
with all their money?

16:05.564 --> 16:08.328
We built damns, bridges,

16:08.367 --> 16:12.167
interstate highways,
schools, hospitals.

16:12.204 --> 16:14.638
We even sent a guy to the moon.

16:14.673 --> 16:17.073
Things seemed to be going
in the right direction.

16:17.109 --> 16:20.169
Dad had a secure job
and Mom could work

16:20.212 --> 16:22.646
if she wanted,
but didn't have to.

16:22.681 --> 16:26.583
Middle-class families only needed
one income to survive.

16:26.618 --> 16:29.883
Our union family had
free health care and free dental.

16:29.922 --> 16:33.380
The kids could go to college
without getting a loan from a bank.

16:33.425 --> 16:37.054
Dad had 4 weeks
paid vacation every summer.

16:37.095 --> 16:40.929
Most people had
a savings account and little debt.

16:40.966 --> 16:44.732
And Dad's pension was set aside
where no one could touch it.

16:44.770 --> 16:48.763
It would be there for him
when he retired.

16:48.807 --> 16:52.868
We got all of this because
our main industrial competition

16:52.911 --> 16:55.436
had been reduced to rubble.

16:55.480 --> 16:58.142
Here's what the German
car industry looked like.

16:58.183 --> 17:01.619
And here's the Japanese
auto industry.

17:01.653 --> 17:03.746
I guess you could say
it's easy to be number one

17:03.789 --> 17:06.723
when you have no competition.

17:06.758 --> 17:09.318
Yes, of course
not everything was perfect.

17:09.361 --> 17:11.261
We didn't mind having to put up

17:11.296 --> 17:14.231
with a little bit of this
and a little bit of that...

17:16.835 --> 17:19.463
just as long as we could be
middle-class.

17:21.807 --> 17:25.503
And we could count on our kids
having it better than we had it.

17:25.544 --> 17:28.877
It sounded like
a good deal to us.

17:28.914 --> 17:33.078
Capitalism-- no one
ever had it so good.

17:40.959 --> 17:42.984
And then, right when
we were in the middle

17:43.028 --> 17:46.465
of this big love affair
with capitalism...

17:46.465 --> 17:48.933
The ABC Sunday Night Movie
"The Gambler"

17:48.967 --> 17:50.628
will continue in its entirety

17:50.669 --> 17:54.264
following this live report
from ABC News.

17:54.306 --> 17:59.175
We are at a turning point
in our history.

17:59.211 --> 18:01.475
Along came Debbie Downer.

18:01.513 --> 18:05.279
Too many of us now
tend to worship

18:05.317 --> 18:09.720
self-indulgence
and consumption.

18:09.755 --> 18:13.748
Human identity
is no longer defined

18:13.792 --> 18:17.523
by what one does,

18:17.562 --> 18:20.429
but by what one owns.

18:20.465 --> 18:22.126
This is not a message

18:22.167 --> 18:25.728
of happiness or reassurance,

18:25.771 --> 18:28.001
but it is the truth

18:28.040 --> 18:30.031
and it is a warning.

18:30.375 --> 18:32.043
What a bummer.

18:32.077 --> 18:35.205
It was time to bring
a new sheriff to town...

18:36.381 --> 18:38.849
one who knew how to act
like a president.

18:38.884 --> 18:42.547
He knew how to handle workers
who wanted a better wage.

18:44.890 --> 18:47.825
All right, mister, I guess you win.

18:47.859 --> 18:49.349
Or these annoying feminists

18:49.394 --> 18:52.158
whining about their
Equal Rights Amendment.

18:52.197 --> 18:54.665
Well, I can change that in a hurry.

18:56.368 --> 19:00.168
A man who knew
how to get the job done.

19:00.205 --> 19:03.732
Ronald Reagan
came out of the B movies

19:03.775 --> 19:07.939
to become the most famous
corporate spokesman of the 1950s.

19:07.979 --> 19:10.675
It's a transistor radio too.
Weighs only a few ounces.

19:10.716 --> 19:12.149
You can slip it
right into your pocket.

19:12.184 --> 19:14.550
Boraxo waterless hand cleaner
really cleans up for us.

19:14.586 --> 19:16.520
He had found his calling

19:16.555 --> 19:19.490
and Wall Street
had found their man.

19:19.524 --> 19:22.584
You see, the banks and corporations
had a simple plan:

19:22.627 --> 19:25.994
to remake America to serve them.

19:26.031 --> 19:27.623
But to pull it off would require

19:27.666 --> 19:30.692
electing a spokesmodel
for president.

19:30.736 --> 19:34.934
And on November 4th, 1980,
that's what we did.

19:34.973 --> 19:36.804
...that I will faithfully execute

19:36.842 --> 19:39.037
the office of President
of the United States.

19:39.077 --> 19:41.272
Ronald Ronald Ronald...

19:41.313 --> 19:43.543
Thank you.

19:43.582 --> 19:46.312
It was an historic moment

19:46.351 --> 19:49.115
because now corporate America
and Wall Street

19:49.154 --> 19:52.146
were in almost complete control.

19:52.190 --> 19:54.886
See that guy standing
next to the president?

19:54.926 --> 19:57.793
You know, the one
that looks like a butler?

19:57.829 --> 20:00.195
His name was Don Regan,

20:00.232 --> 20:02.496
the Chairman of Merrill Lynch,

20:02.534 --> 20:07.062
the richest and biggest
retail brokerage firm in the world.

20:07.105 --> 20:10.074
He took the key position
of Treasury Secretary

20:10.108 --> 20:13.976
so he could enact the tax cuts
that the rich wanted.

20:14.012 --> 20:16.310
Regan then became
White House Chief of Staff

20:16.348 --> 20:19.909
as the president started to fade.

20:19.951 --> 20:23.079
Then they should give the president
what 43 governors have,

20:23.121 --> 20:25.589
a line-item veto.

20:25.624 --> 20:26.885
And...

20:27.826 --> 20:31.087
You're gonna have to speed it up.

20:31.930 --> 20:35.093
Who tells the president
to speed it up?

20:35.133 --> 20:38.967
The man from Merrill Lynch,
that's who.

20:39.004 --> 20:43.464
Things in America would never
be the same again.

20:43.508 --> 20:46.944
The country would now be run
like a corporation.

20:46.978 --> 20:49.071
We're going to turn the bull loose.

20:52.517 --> 20:56.112
And 4 years later,
when Reagan ran for reelection,

20:56.154 --> 20:59.590
it was all smiley faces
and happy talk.

20:59.624 --> 21:02.149
I really feel that we're gonna
be better off in the long run.

21:02.194 --> 21:05.129
We're on the upward swing

21:05.163 --> 21:08.690
and the factories are working
much stronger than before.

21:08.733 --> 21:11.133
We're back on top.

21:14.673 --> 21:17.039
Actually, what Reagan presided over

21:17.075 --> 21:21.637
was the wholesale dismantling
of our industrial infrastructure.

21:21.680 --> 21:25.514
This was not done to save money
or remain competitive,

21:25.550 --> 21:27.609
as companies back then
were already posting

21:27.652 --> 21:31.053
record earnings in the billions.

21:31.089 --> 21:34.820
No, it was done
for short-term profits...

21:38.930 --> 21:41.831
and to destroy the unions.

21:41.867 --> 21:44.961
Millions of people
were thrown out of work

21:45.003 --> 21:48.336
and the remaining workers
were told to work twice as hard.

21:49.808 --> 21:53.266
But wages for working people
remained frozen.

21:55.180 --> 21:58.013
The richest Americans
had their top income tax rate

21:58.049 --> 22:00.984
cut in half.

22:02.821 --> 22:05.915
Instead of being paid
a decent wage,

22:05.957 --> 22:08.721
we were encouraged
to live on borrowed money

22:08.760 --> 22:12.821
until our household debt
was nearly 100% of the GDP.

22:12.864 --> 22:16.027
There was an explosion
of personal bankruptcies.

22:16.067 --> 22:19.935
We found it necessary to lock up
millions of our citizens.

22:19.971 --> 22:22.269
Sales of antidepressants
skyrocketed

22:22.307 --> 22:24.901
as insurance
and pharmaceutical company greed

22:24.943 --> 22:28.140
pushed the cost
of healthcare up and up.

22:28.179 --> 22:31.706
All of this was great news
for the stock market

22:31.750 --> 22:34.810
and for America's CEOs.

22:39.824 --> 22:41.519
Half of Flint was now receiving

22:41.560 --> 22:44.723
some form
of government welfare.

22:44.763 --> 22:46.628
During the end
of the Reagan years,

22:46.665 --> 22:49.896
I made my first movie about
what had happened to the country

22:49.935 --> 22:53.393
and specifically to my hometown
of Flint, Michigan,

22:53.438 --> 22:56.669
the birthplace of General Motors.

22:56.708 --> 23:00.576
GM was posting profits
of over $4 billion

23:00.612 --> 23:02.603
while at the same time eliminating

23:02.647 --> 23:05.411
tens of thousands of jobs.

23:05.450 --> 23:09.386
I went to see GM's chief lobbyist
in Flint, Mr. Tom Kay,

23:09.421 --> 23:12.618
to ask him why
this was happening.

23:12.657 --> 23:15.649
General Motors wouldn't be doing
anybody any service

23:15.694 --> 23:17.161
if it goes bankrupt.

23:17.195 --> 23:18.958
It has to do what it has to do

23:18.997 --> 23:22.194
in order to stay competitive
in today's economic climate.

23:22.233 --> 23:26.294
Even if that means
eliminating 18,000 jobs?

23:26.338 --> 23:29.307
Even if it means
eliminating 20,000 jobs.

23:29.341 --> 23:31.639
- Or 30,000?
- Whatever.

23:31.676 --> 23:36.238
- How about all the jobs here in Flint?
- It could feasibly happen.

23:36.281 --> 23:38.841
And it did.

23:38.883 --> 23:41.681
Nearly all the jobs were eliminated

23:41.720 --> 23:44.484
and GM went bankrupt.

23:46.291 --> 23:49.920
Perhaps more distressing was the fact
that the rest of America

23:49.961 --> 23:54.091
was now starting to resemble
Flint, Michigan.

23:54.132 --> 23:58.296
But there were some cities
that still took pride in their greatness.

23:58.336 --> 24:00.099
<i>* Cleveland</i>

24:00.138 --> 24:02.629
<i>* Come on down
to Cleveland Town, everyone</i>

24:02.674 --> 24:05.575
<i>* Come and look
at both of our buildings</i>

24:05.610 --> 24:08.408
<i>* Here's the place where
there used to be industry</i>

24:08.446 --> 24:11.279
<i>* This train is carrying jobs
out of Cleveland</i>

24:11.316 --> 24:14.308
<i>* See the sun almost
3 times a year</i>

24:14.352 --> 24:17.116
<i>* This guy has at least 2 DUIs</i>

24:17.155 --> 24:20.090
<i>* Our economy's
based on LeBron James</i>

24:20.125 --> 24:22.958
<i>* Buy a house
for the price of a VCR</i>

24:22.994 --> 24:25.690
<i>* Our main export
is crippling depression</i>

24:25.730 --> 24:28.699
<i>* We're so retarded
that we think this is art</i>

24:28.733 --> 24:33.363
<i>* It could be worse, though,
at least we're not Detroit</i>

24:33.405 --> 24:35.600
<i>* We're not Detroit.</i>

24:35.640 --> 24:39.337
No, they're not Detroit.

24:39.377 --> 24:42.005
For 20 years I tried
to warn GM and others

24:42.047 --> 24:45.710
that this day was coming,
but to no avail.

24:45.750 --> 24:48.014
Maybe now they'd listen.

24:48.053 --> 24:50.487
So I went down to the headquarters
of General Motors

24:50.522 --> 24:54.185
one last time to share
some of my ideas.

24:54.225 --> 24:56.386
You don't have permission.
You can't film here.

24:57.462 --> 24:59.259
You don't have permission
from General Motors.

24:59.297 --> 25:01.891
- You can't film here.
- I'm just going up to see the chairman.

25:01.933 --> 25:03.924
No, sir.
No, sir.

25:03.968 --> 25:06.198
You know, I've been doing this
for, like, 20 years.

25:06.237 --> 25:07.727
I understand, sir.

25:07.772 --> 25:11.264
And I have not been
let into this building for 20 years,

25:11.309 --> 25:14.972
and I think it's about time
someone just let me in

25:15.013 --> 25:16.640
and let me talk to them.

25:16.681 --> 25:18.546
I've got some good ideas.

25:18.583 --> 25:23.020
4-7 to 7-6 Bravo Area Alpha.

25:23.054 --> 25:25.454
Go ahead.

25:25.490 --> 25:28.721
It's Michael Moore here
to see the chairman.

25:31.029 --> 25:33.554
Repeat that.

25:33.598 --> 25:35.691
It's the filmmaker
Mr. Michael Moore.

25:35.734 --> 25:37.725
He's here to see the chairman.

25:38.970 --> 25:40.562
- Gentlemen.
- Yes.

25:40.605 --> 25:43.005
You need to get prior permission.
You cannot film here, okay?

25:43.041 --> 25:45.771
But if I can't go in and get permission,
what am I supposed to do?

25:45.810 --> 25:48.301
I guess they're right.
Breaking up is hard to do.

25:48.346 --> 25:50.644
Stop that. Don't do that.
Just go in the building.

25:50.682 --> 25:53.378
For 35 years,
GM made more money

25:53.418 --> 25:55.511
than any other corporation.

25:55.553 --> 25:57.145
But eventually,
Germany and Japan

25:57.188 --> 25:59.986
rebuilt their car industry
and produced vehicles

26:00.024 --> 26:03.050
that were safer than ours,
more fuel efficient

26:03.094 --> 26:05.255
and rarely, if ever, broke down.

26:08.366 --> 26:12.735
In Germany, unions help hire and fire
the board of directors

26:12.771 --> 26:16.172
so the workers have a say
in what's going on.

26:19.043 --> 26:21.034
You see, the people
of Japan and Germany

26:21.312 --> 26:24.748
fight to make sure that even
their conservative political leaders

26:24.783 --> 26:26.910
don't destroy their middle class.

26:31.256 --> 26:33.884
So where exactly
are we right now?

26:33.925 --> 26:38.487
On the day that General Motors
declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy,

26:38.530 --> 26:41.966
I went with my dad to visit
the AC Spark Plug plant

26:42.000 --> 26:44.594
where he had worked
for over 30 years.

26:44.636 --> 26:48.299
- So you worked actually right here.
- You'd have to go--

26:48.339 --> 26:52.139
they had a ramp that took you
up over that, just beyond that...

26:52.177 --> 26:53.701
- Just beyond that space there?
- Yeah.

26:53.745 --> 26:55.736
- And then the factory was all over there?
- Yeah.

26:55.780 --> 26:58.180
The whole complex is, like,
2 miles long.

26:58.216 --> 27:00.548
I remember Mom bringing
us kids in to pick you up.

27:00.585 --> 27:02.485
- 2:30 every day.
- Yeah.

27:02.520 --> 27:05.546
You'd walk out of there,
right over in there in fact.

27:05.590 --> 27:07.558
And we'd be waiting
in the car for you

27:07.592 --> 27:10.083
and we'd see you
come down the ramp.

27:10.128 --> 27:13.723
We got real excited
every time we saw you.

27:13.765 --> 27:16.256
I was there 33½ years.

27:16.301 --> 27:17.960
33½ years?

27:18.403 --> 27:21.201
What's your best memory here,
being here, working here?

27:21.239 --> 27:24.402
My best memory?
I think the people.

27:24.442 --> 27:26.433
They were a really good bunch.

27:26.477 --> 27:29.344
- You liked the crowd you worked with?
- Yeah.

27:29.380 --> 27:32.645
A good place to work. I enjoyed it.

27:32.684 --> 27:35.551
But I'm sorry to see it go.

27:43.161 --> 27:45.891
Shortly before Christmas 2008,

27:45.930 --> 27:49.058
Republic Windows & Doors
in Chicago, Illinois,

27:49.100 --> 27:52.331
abruptly fired
its entire unionized workforce

27:52.370 --> 27:55.430
of over 250 people.

27:55.473 --> 27:58.931
They were given
only 3 days' notice.

27:58.977 --> 28:01.036
Bank of America
would no longer provide

28:01.079 --> 28:03.274
a line of credit to the company,

28:03.314 --> 28:07.410
and so the workers were not paid
the money owed to them.

28:07.452 --> 28:10.250
My life revolves around this job.

28:10.288 --> 28:14.452
I live according to my obligation
to my job, you know?

28:14.492 --> 28:18.553
And it's not just me,
it's all of the workers here.

28:18.596 --> 28:21.394
We go above and beyond

28:21.432 --> 28:24.026
the call of duty for Republic.

28:24.068 --> 28:26.798
And at the end,

28:26.838 --> 28:29.671
Republic cares nothing for us.

28:31.509 --> 28:34.478
We found out that they're gonna
shut the plant on Tuesday.

28:34.512 --> 28:37.743
We don't deserve what
they're doing to us, you know?

28:37.782 --> 28:41.081
It really hurts because,
like I said,

28:41.119 --> 28:43.087
this is my second family.

28:43.121 --> 28:45.715
So it was-- it really hurts.
It really hurts.

28:45.757 --> 28:49.659
I'm gonna miss
all of them, you know?

28:49.694 --> 28:52.663
I'm gonna miss them
and I don't think

28:52.697 --> 28:55.029
anybody on this planet

28:55.066 --> 28:58.297
deserves what they've done to us.

29:05.777 --> 29:07.836
Scenes like this
were being repeated

29:07.879 --> 29:11.940
all over the country,
and no one seemed to mind.

29:11.983 --> 29:14.383
<i>* Zambezi, Zambezi</i>

29:14.419 --> 29:17.047
<i>* Zambezi, Zam.</i>

29:17.588 --> 29:21.456
The president was enjoying
his final year in office.

29:21.492 --> 29:23.790
But as the economy
started to fall apart,

29:23.828 --> 29:27.958
he decided it was time
to roll out the C word.

29:27.999 --> 29:31.025
Capitalism is the best system
ever devised.

29:31.069 --> 29:32.468
Really?

29:32.503 --> 29:35.768
Voices from the left and right
are equating the free enterprise system

29:35.807 --> 29:39.470
with greed and exploitation
and failure.

29:39.910 --> 29:41.501
Greed,

29:41.546 --> 29:44.709
exploitation, failure?

29:44.749 --> 29:46.273
Go on, I'm listening.

29:46.317 --> 29:51.186
Capitalism offers people
the freedom to choose

29:51.222 --> 29:53.782
where they work
and what they do...

29:53.825 --> 29:56.521
Pat Andrews
has been looking for work.

29:56.561 --> 30:00.429
Every morning she scans
the classifieds in vain.

30:00.465 --> 30:02.228
There isn't anything in here.

30:02.266 --> 30:05.201
I'm not gonna be a gentleman's club
hired dancer either.

30:06.537 --> 30:10.029
...the opportunity to buy
or sell products they want.

30:10.074 --> 30:12.008
Tom Rendon has avoided layoffs

30:12.043 --> 30:14.705
at his sign company
in Stockton, California,

30:14.746 --> 30:16.646
all because this one word
now makes up

30:16.681 --> 30:18.740
for half his business.

30:18.783 --> 30:22.344
If you seek social justice
and human dignity,

30:22.387 --> 30:26.221
the free market system
is the way to go.

30:29.093 --> 30:32.221
And for those seeking
justice in Pennsylvania,

30:32.263 --> 30:36.165
free enterprise
was definitely the way to go.

30:39.670 --> 30:41.331
Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania,

30:41.372 --> 30:43.533
has one of the highest rates
in the state

30:43.574 --> 30:47.203
of young people locked up
in the juvenile home.

30:47.245 --> 30:49.577
Perhaps it's because
the good people here

30:49.614 --> 30:51.980
employ the practices
of capitalism

30:52.016 --> 30:55.247
in dealing with
their wayward youth.

30:55.286 --> 30:58.187
The county hired a private
profit-making corporation

30:58.222 --> 31:02.352
with a sweet-sounding name,
PA Child Care.

31:03.594 --> 31:06.529
It was owned and run
by 2 businessmen,

31:06.564 --> 31:11.228
one of whom was Robert Powell,
an attorney and entrepreneur.

31:11.269 --> 31:13.203
His good friend Judge Conahan

31:13.237 --> 31:15.603
closed down
the public juvenile home

31:15.640 --> 31:17.574
and then got
PA Child Care to build

31:17.608 --> 31:20.771
an $8 million
privately-owned facility

31:20.812 --> 31:22.712
and charge it back to the county

31:22.747 --> 31:25.443
for a mere $58 million lease.

31:27.385 --> 31:31.014
Let's meet some of Wilkes-Barre's
juvenile delinquents.

31:31.055 --> 31:33.353
Magee smoked pot
at a high school party.

31:33.391 --> 31:36.622
I was very rebellious
when I was at this age.

31:36.661 --> 31:39.459
Matt, he got into
an argument at the dinner table.

31:39.497 --> 31:42.159
I threw a piece of meat,
as in steak,

31:42.200 --> 31:44.668
cooked dinner,
at my mother's boyfriend.

31:44.702 --> 31:47.068
Jamie got in a fight
at a shopping mall

31:47.105 --> 31:48.367
with her best friend.

31:48.406 --> 31:51.842
I just figured, you know, we just weren't
gonna be friends anymore.

31:51.876 --> 31:54.401
And Hillary made
a MySpace page

31:54.445 --> 31:56.606
making fun
of her assistant principal

31:56.647 --> 31:59.138
for being strict and having
no sense of humor.

31:59.183 --> 32:02.619
And it said some pretty silly,
like, 14-year-old-girl stuff.

32:02.653 --> 32:06.384
Her assistant principal
called the police.

32:06.424 --> 32:10.724
They all appeared before
kindly Judge Mark Ciavarella.

32:10.761 --> 32:13.491
These kids were about
to get their first lesson

32:13.531 --> 32:15.499
in American capitalism:

32:15.533 --> 32:20.334
time is money, lots of money.

32:20.371 --> 32:23.670
I went in front of the court,
in front of Mr. Ciavarella,

32:23.708 --> 32:25.505
and I wasn't even in front of him
for 4 minutes.

32:25.543 --> 32:27.636
I was only in front of him
for, like, 2 minutes.

32:27.678 --> 32:31.307
The first thing that
Judge Ciavarella said to me was,

32:31.349 --> 32:34.216
"What makes you think
you can do this kind of crap?"

32:34.252 --> 32:36.686
I'm sure he knew in his mind
when I walked in

32:36.721 --> 32:38.484
that he was locking this kid up
no matter what.

32:38.523 --> 32:39.820
He didn't even look at me.

32:39.857 --> 32:42.826
Once I entered the courtroom,
I didn't have any chance.

32:42.860 --> 32:45.124
There was about 6 kids
who went in front of me.

32:45.163 --> 32:47.188
Every single kid who went
in front of Ciavarella,

32:47.231 --> 32:50.598
for all different reasons--
some minor, some serious--

32:50.635 --> 32:52.330
got sent away.

32:52.370 --> 32:56.272
Although Wilkes-Barre is located
in the United States of America,

32:56.307 --> 33:00.437
here capitalism
trumped democracy.

33:00.478 --> 33:03.709
Robert Powell, one of the owners
of PA Child Care,

33:03.748 --> 33:08.151
cut a business deal with Judge Conahan
and Judge Ciavarella.

33:08.186 --> 33:11.622
Judge Ciavarella then stepped up
his conviction rates.

33:11.656 --> 33:13.385
Many of these kids
were funneled

33:13.424 --> 33:18.191
into PA Child Care's
for-profit juvenile facility.

33:18.229 --> 33:19.628
And for their troubles,

33:19.664 --> 33:23.862
the judges received
over $2.6 million

33:23.901 --> 33:27.860
while the owners of PA Child Care
received tens of millions

33:27.905 --> 33:30.499
of taxpayer dollars
from the county.

33:30.541 --> 33:33.669
And where did Powell go
to enjoy all that money?

33:33.711 --> 33:35.906
On his private plane

33:35.947 --> 33:39.007
and his yacht,
the "Reel Justice."

33:40.685 --> 33:45.588
6,500 children
were unjustly convicted.

33:45.623 --> 33:49.024
It was good business
while it lasted.

33:50.161 --> 33:53.028
2 Luzerne County judges
in big trouble with the law.

33:53.064 --> 33:54.053
They're going to jail.

33:54.098 --> 33:55.531
Some kids were locked up

33:55.566 --> 33:59.832
even when probation officers
objected to detention.

33:59.870 --> 34:02.862
In there you lose track of time
and you lose track of the date.

34:02.907 --> 34:04.135
I was barely keeping track.

34:04.175 --> 34:07.303
It was supposed to be, like--
I believe it was, like, 2 months.

34:07.345 --> 34:09.745
And it went from 2 months
to 9 months.

34:09.780 --> 34:12.476
He said originally
3 to 6 months,

34:12.516 --> 34:16.509
but somehow I ended up
being there 11½ months

34:16.554 --> 34:19.387
and I never went back
in front of the judge at all

34:19.422 --> 34:21.050
for him to give me extensions.

34:21.092 --> 34:22.889
Not only did PA Child Care

34:22.927 --> 34:25.760
pay off the judges
to fill their cells,

34:25.795 --> 34:28.458
but their employees were the ones
who got to decide

34:28.498 --> 34:31.900
when a child had
enough rehabilitation.

34:31.936 --> 34:35.268
But that makes sense,
because any time a governmental unit

34:35.306 --> 34:37.866
turns over to
a profit-making corporation

34:37.908 --> 34:40.308
the duties it should be performing,

34:40.344 --> 34:42.369
what do you expect to happen?

34:42.413 --> 34:45.007
It makes me feel like
an item that they just used

34:45.049 --> 34:47.449
to just get money
and then tossed me aside.

34:47.485 --> 34:51.945
I'm just trying
to work on my flying

34:51.989 --> 34:54.184
and just trying to prepare
for my future

34:54.225 --> 34:57.456
so I can put this all behind me,
finally be done with all this.

34:57.495 --> 34:59.963
During the whole trial
I wasn't in control at all,

34:59.997 --> 35:02.431
but with flying it's only me.

35:02.466 --> 35:04.934
It's just that I just get
to do everything by myself.

35:04.969 --> 35:06.994
I'm the only one on the control.

35:07.038 --> 35:08.869
Matt loves to fly

35:08.906 --> 35:12.171
and hopes to become
a pilot someday.

35:12.209 --> 35:14.837
If he does,
he'll get his 2nd lesson

35:14.879 --> 35:17.473
in capitalism:

35:17.515 --> 35:20.541
that in America,
sometimes you're better off

35:20.584 --> 35:23.020
working at Mickey D's.

35:23.520 --> 35:25.580
Remember Sully?

35:25.623 --> 35:26.954
Captain Sullenberger,

35:26.991 --> 35:30.017
who safely landed an airbus
in the Hudson River

35:30.061 --> 35:32.287
saving the lives of 150 passengers?

35:33.930 --> 35:35.997
A true American hero.

35:39.136 --> 35:42.037
He met the mayor.
He went to the State of the Union.

35:42.073 --> 35:44.769
Heck, he even went
to the Super Bowl.

35:44.809 --> 35:47.039
And then he went to Congress.

35:47.078 --> 35:50.138
Flying has been my lifelong passion.

35:50.181 --> 35:52.342
But while I love my profession,

35:52.383 --> 35:55.079
I do not like
what has happened to it.

35:55.319 --> 35:57.212
It is my personal experience

35:57.254 --> 36:00.451
that my decision to remain
in the profession I love

36:00.491 --> 36:05.121
has come at a great financial cost
to me and to my family.

36:05.162 --> 36:07.426
My pay has been cut 40%.

36:07.465 --> 36:11.128
My pension, like most airline pensions,
has been terminated.

36:11.168 --> 36:14.695
So please do not think I exaggerate
when I say that I do not know

36:14.739 --> 36:18.038
a single professional airline pilot
who wants his or her children

36:18.075 --> 36:19.667
to follow in their footsteps.

36:20.210 --> 36:22.440
You cleared the room
with that one, Sully.

36:22.480 --> 36:24.778
I don't think the congressmen
wanted to hear that stuff.

36:24.815 --> 36:27.750
- They like you as a hero.
- The current experience...

36:42.333 --> 36:44.392
What was your starting pay as a pilot?

36:44.435 --> 36:46.733
I made $19,000 the first year.

36:46.771 --> 36:50.229
I was bumped up to about 22,000
or 23,000 the second year.

36:50.274 --> 36:52.902
Last year, gross pay

36:52.943 --> 36:55.377
I made $17,600.

36:55.413 --> 36:58.007
There's a joke in the airline
when we get our wings pinned on us

36:58.048 --> 37:01.506
as new-hire airline pilots
that the company just kinda says,

37:01.552 --> 37:04.316
"Hey, don't apply for food stamps
in your uniform."

37:04.355 --> 37:07.222
I don't know about you,
but I want the pilot

37:07.258 --> 37:11.058
who's got me 30,000 feet up in the air
to be paid really well

37:11.095 --> 37:14.155
and not sitting up in the cockpit
digging through the pilot's seat

37:14.198 --> 37:16.189
looking for loose change.

37:16.233 --> 37:18.201
There was a period
of about 4 months

37:18.235 --> 37:20.999
where I was on food stamps.

37:21.038 --> 37:22.528
- You were on food stamps?
- Yes.

37:22.573 --> 37:25.337
- And you were still flying the plane?
- Yes.

37:25.376 --> 37:27.742
With my--
with my food stamp card.

37:27.778 --> 37:30.542
The lady I talked to
in the food stamp office,

37:30.581 --> 37:33.516
when I told her I was a pilot,
she didn't bat an eye,

37:33.551 --> 37:35.883
but she didn't--
I knew she didn't believe me.

37:35.920 --> 37:38.548
How have you gotten by?
How have you been able to afford things?

37:38.589 --> 37:41.183
Relying on credit cards
to buy the groceries at times

37:41.225 --> 37:42.954
- when I wasn't on food stamps.
- Really?

37:42.993 --> 37:45.291
I have about $10,000
in credit card debt

37:45.329 --> 37:47.320
just on the necessities,

37:47.364 --> 37:49.924
not on the big-screen TV
and the stereo.

37:49.967 --> 37:53.164
You're using it to buy
your groceries and get by.

37:53.204 --> 37:55.138
- Yes.
- Do you have any student loan debt?

37:55.172 --> 37:56.867
- Yes.
- How much?

37:56.907 --> 37:58.465
Mine is about 80,000.

37:58.509 --> 38:01.910
- I took out $100,000.
- Student loans?

38:01.946 --> 38:04.813
And by the time I pay it back,
at this rate,

38:04.849 --> 38:07.215
it'll probably cost me well over
a half a million with interest

38:07.251 --> 38:09.811
and fees and penalties.

38:09.854 --> 38:12.084
It's something that I don't--
I don't like to spend a lot of time

38:12.122 --> 38:13.817
thinking about
because it's abysmal.

38:13.858 --> 38:16.326
It's one way that I get down
really quickly

38:16.360 --> 38:18.021
about my chosen career field

38:18.062 --> 38:20.496
is to think about how much I owe
and how little I make.

38:20.531 --> 38:23.432
Have you had to work
a 2nd job to make ends meet?

38:23.467 --> 38:25.833
I walk dogs on the side,

38:25.870 --> 38:29.067
I distribute MonaVie Juice.

38:29.106 --> 38:32.371
I have known pilots
to donate plasma

38:32.409 --> 38:34.240
for extra cash.

38:34.278 --> 38:37.145
- You mean they give blood?
- They-- well--

38:37.181 --> 38:39.809
So they can make extra money
even though they're flying an airplane?

38:39.850 --> 38:41.841
Yeah.
They donate their plasma.

38:41.886 --> 38:46.152
So they get the blood back,
but you can get paid for plasma.

38:46.190 --> 38:47.487
I see.

38:47.525 --> 38:49.322
They suck the blood out of you,
take the plasma...

38:49.360 --> 38:50.827
- Give you the blood back.
- ...give you the--

38:50.861 --> 38:52.726
Well then,
not such a bad deal.

38:52.763 --> 38:56.255
The only reason people stay flying
is because they love it.

38:56.300 --> 38:58.165
And managements
take advantage of that.

38:58.202 --> 39:01.535
The airlines
have managed to farm out

39:01.572 --> 39:05.975
a lot of the flying to commuters

39:06.010 --> 39:09.207
in an effort to basically
bust the unions.

39:09.246 --> 39:11.339
You can't compete

39:11.382 --> 39:15.614
to a lower and lower level
every year

39:15.653 --> 39:18.053
without skimping
on safety somehow.

39:20.357 --> 39:25.158
At approximately 10:15 PM
on February 12, 2009,

39:25.195 --> 39:27.925
Continental connection flight 3407

39:27.965 --> 39:30.559
began its descent
to the airport in Buffalo.

39:32.336 --> 39:34.201
Stand by, there's some
ground communication,

39:34.238 --> 39:36.138
either state police
or sheriff's department.

39:36.173 --> 39:37.868
We need to find out if anything
is on the ground.

39:37.908 --> 39:40.308
This aircraft was 5 miles out,
and all of a sudden

39:40.344 --> 39:42.175
we have no response
to that aircraft.

39:42.212 --> 39:45.204
All I could tell you is there was
an aircraft over the marker

39:45.249 --> 39:48.275
and we're not talking to them now.

39:48.319 --> 39:50.480
No one survived the crash

39:50.521 --> 39:53.456
and 50 people lost their lives.

39:54.992 --> 39:58.257
The media focused
on the actions of the pilots.

39:58.295 --> 40:01.355
Captain Marvin Renslow
and First Officer Shaw

40:01.398 --> 40:03.628
were chatting about their careers.

40:03.667 --> 40:06.033
"Careers" is a euphemism

40:06.070 --> 40:08.470
for what the pilots
were really talking about:

40:08.505 --> 40:12.635
how little they were paid
and how overworked they were.

40:12.676 --> 40:14.769
There would be
no discussion in the media

40:14.812 --> 40:17.076
about why we have
an economic system

40:17.114 --> 40:20.743
that allows a pilot to be paid less
than a manager at Taco Bell.

40:20.784 --> 40:22.183
First Officer Shaw

40:22.219 --> 40:25.848
made between
$16,000 and $20,000 a year

40:25.889 --> 40:29.450
and at one point
worked a second job.

40:29.493 --> 40:31.927
Her 2nd job had been waitressing

40:31.962 --> 40:33.953
at a coffee shop.

40:35.265 --> 40:38.792
How are these companies
able to get away with this?

40:38.836 --> 40:41.532
I guess that's the point of capitalism.

40:41.572 --> 40:44.336
It allows you to get away
with anything,

40:44.375 --> 40:47.745
like making a profit
off the death of an employee.

40:49.313 --> 40:51.679
Sweetie, I can open it.
Let's try it with this.

40:51.715 --> 40:53.774
This is Irma Johnson.

40:53.817 --> 40:56.786
Irma's husband Dan
worked in middle management

40:56.820 --> 40:58.981
at Amegy Bank in Houston, Texas.

40:59.023 --> 41:01.082
- Wanna try to spread it?
- No.

41:01.125 --> 41:03.650
Dan recently died of cancer,

41:03.694 --> 41:07.926
leaving behind Irma
and their 2 sons.

41:07.965 --> 41:10.525
But unbeknownst to Irma,
Amegy had taken out

41:10.567 --> 41:14.526
a secret life insurance policy
on Dan's life.

41:14.571 --> 41:18.803
The bank generously named itself
as the beneficiary

41:18.842 --> 41:21.333
in the event of Dan's death.

41:21.378 --> 41:24.506
The insurance company
then accidentally informed Irma

41:24.548 --> 41:28.678
that Amegy Bank had received
a check for $1½ million

41:28.719 --> 41:31.654
just weeks after Dan died.

41:31.689 --> 41:33.486
Thank you for helping.

41:33.524 --> 41:34.582
They never told me.

41:34.625 --> 41:38.152
I wanted to find out, well,
why did they purchase a policy for him?

41:38.195 --> 41:40.129
- You didn't know about it?
- No.

41:40.164 --> 41:43.827
And they named themselves
as the beneficiary.

41:43.867 --> 41:44.856
Yeah.

41:44.902 --> 41:47.063
So your husband's death

41:47.104 --> 41:50.073
made them $1.5 million richer?

41:52.409 --> 41:55.936
I know it's not right
for them to try to profit

41:55.979 --> 41:58.413
from my husband's death.

41:58.449 --> 42:00.246
When I first realized
what was happening,

42:00.284 --> 42:04.345
I was in disbelief.

42:04.388 --> 42:07.118
- It's hurtful.
- I'm so sorry.

42:12.529 --> 42:16.124
it's hurtful and I wanted answers.

42:16.166 --> 42:18.828
Irma contacted Michael D. Myers,

42:18.869 --> 42:21.360
a local attorney who had
already been looking into

42:21.405 --> 42:24.704
these kind of corporate
insurance policies on their employees.

42:26.110 --> 42:28.704
With the normal use of life insurance,
where you're guarding against

42:28.746 --> 42:33.308
the loss of a loved one
or a breadwinner of the family,

42:33.350 --> 42:37.753
you don't want that person to die.

42:37.788 --> 42:39.949
With these policies,
the companies that buy these

42:39.990 --> 42:41.855
want the employees to die

42:41.892 --> 42:44.588
in accordance
with the policy projections.

42:44.628 --> 42:48.530
You are more valuable dead
to a company than alive.

42:49.833 --> 42:53.325
American Greetings, RR Donnelly & Sons,
and Proctor & Gamble

42:53.370 --> 42:56.134
are all having problems
with mortality.

42:56.173 --> 42:58.664
These 4 combined programs
are running at 50%

42:58.709 --> 43:00.199
of expected mortality.

43:00.244 --> 43:03.702
These clients are acutely aware
of this problem.

43:03.747 --> 43:06.443
Basically here the broker
is complaining

43:06.483 --> 43:08.883
that not enough
employees are dying.

43:08.919 --> 43:12.616
And therefore the investment returns
are not matching the projections.

43:12.656 --> 43:15.090
The broker writes
that NCC is running

43:15.125 --> 43:17.821
at 78% of expected mortality.

43:17.861 --> 43:21.729
Okay, so 78% of the people
we expected to die died.

43:21.765 --> 43:24.996
But the problem with that
is 3 of them were suicides.

43:25.035 --> 43:27.162
And you can't count
on that every year.

43:27.204 --> 43:29.229
Can you think of any other situation

43:29.273 --> 43:33.607
were you'd actually want
people to die?

43:33.644 --> 43:37.842
Combatants in war, I guess.

43:38.681 --> 43:41.681
When do you want people to die?

43:41.718 --> 43:43.345
I-I don't know.

43:43.387 --> 43:47.187
War situations,
terrorism situations.

43:49.126 --> 43:51.822
Drug trials, perhaps.
I don't know.

43:51.862 --> 43:54.456
I don't know.
That's an odd question.

43:54.498 --> 43:57.729
I didn't understand
how any of this could be legal.

43:57.768 --> 44:00.601
After all, there's a reason
that there's a law

44:00.637 --> 44:05.040
prohibiting me from taking out
a fire insurance policy on your house

44:05.075 --> 44:09.307
because I have a vested interest
in your house burning down.

44:09.346 --> 44:12.474
Since Attorney Myers had been
researching this for years,

44:12.516 --> 44:14.575
I asked him which companies
were profiting

44:14.618 --> 44:16.415
from these insurance policies.

44:16.453 --> 44:17.886
I don't know,
you don't know,

44:17.921 --> 44:20.549
because there's no place
you can go and find out

44:20.591 --> 44:24.220
whether your company
is a purchaser

44:24.261 --> 44:26.559
- of these types of products.
- Which ones do you know?

44:26.597 --> 44:28.292
The ones that we know
that have slipped out are

44:28.332 --> 44:30.357
Bank of America, Citibank,

44:30.400 --> 44:33.699
Wal-Mart, Winn-Dixie,
Proctor & Gamble,

44:33.737 --> 44:35.864
McDonnell Douglas, Hershey,

44:35.906 --> 44:38.875
Nestlé, AT&T
Southwestern Bell,

44:38.909 --> 44:40.968
Ameritech, American Express--

44:41.011 --> 44:43.070
- This is blue chip you're talking about.
- Yeah.

44:43.113 --> 44:46.310
These aren't fly-by-night companies
trying to do a scam here

44:46.350 --> 44:48.511
so they can collect a check
if one of their employees dies.

44:48.552 --> 44:51.851
There are probably
several million Americans

44:51.889 --> 44:55.723
who are covered by one of these policies
or have been at some point.

44:55.759 --> 44:57.021
There's a lot of it out there.

44:57.060 --> 44:59.221
This is Paul Smith.

44:59.263 --> 45:02.824
He used to be what is known
as a loyal employee.

45:02.866 --> 45:07.098
I worked for Wal-Mart for 18 years
and I gave them 110%.

45:07.137 --> 45:08.900
I mean, I loved that company.

45:08.939 --> 45:10.429
And as it turned out,
Wal-Mart took out

45:10.474 --> 45:13.534
over 350,000
life insurance policies

45:13.577 --> 45:15.704
on rank and file associates.

45:15.746 --> 45:16.940
These weren't executives.

45:16.980 --> 45:20.416
These were people like my wife,
a cake decorator for 18 months.

45:20.450 --> 45:24.045
That's the type of people they were taking
insurance policies out on.

45:24.087 --> 45:28.080
Paul's wife LaDonna left her job
at the Wal-Mart bakery

45:28.125 --> 45:30.923
so she could be a stay-at-home mom
for her 2 kids.

45:30.961 --> 45:34.124
She had asthma real real bad.

45:34.164 --> 45:36.098
She went into
the emergency room one night

45:36.133 --> 45:38.101
and a nurse comes out and says,
"Are you Mr. Smith?"

45:38.135 --> 45:39.625
And I said, "Yes."

45:39.670 --> 45:43.731
And she said, "We don't think
your wife's gonna make it."

45:43.774 --> 45:45.742
LaDonna slipped into a coma

45:45.776 --> 45:48.108
from which she would
never awaken.

45:48.145 --> 45:50.306
Her family rushed to the hospital,

45:50.347 --> 45:52.781
even though there was nothing
they could do to help.

45:52.816 --> 45:55.376
There was a wall here
and LaDonna's in the room

45:55.419 --> 45:56.852
on the other side of the wall.

45:56.887 --> 45:59.151
And Jessica kept saying,
"Where is she?"

45:59.189 --> 46:01.817
And I said, "She's right on
the other side of that wall."

46:01.858 --> 46:05.453
And Jessica said,
"Can we cut a hole in the wall

46:05.495 --> 46:07.986
so that we can see her?"

46:08.031 --> 46:10.056
And that just sticks with me.

46:10.100 --> 46:11.931
Do you remember that?

46:14.037 --> 46:18.406
We had to stay in there with her,
and so we'd write letters to her.

46:18.442 --> 46:22.902
"My dear wife, I miss you more
than any words can possibly say.

46:22.946 --> 46:24.504
You are my life.

46:24.548 --> 46:26.948
You always see beauty
in the simplest things.

46:26.984 --> 46:31.421
I've always admired you for that.
I wish I could have told you that more.

46:31.455 --> 46:33.719
I want you to come back
to me soon.

46:33.757 --> 46:36.749
I still have a lot left to learn
from you, baby doll.

46:36.793 --> 46:38.954
Your loving husband, Paul."

46:40.897 --> 46:43.331
You okay, Wesley?

46:44.735 --> 46:47.499
She was 26 years old.

46:47.537 --> 46:50.472
You're silly.

46:50.507 --> 46:54.170
The younger a person is,
the higher the benefit is

46:54.211 --> 46:57.009
because they're expected
to live longer.

46:57.047 --> 46:59.242
Women are also expected
to live longer than men.

46:59.282 --> 47:02.251
So the most valuable employee
to the company

47:02.285 --> 47:05.186
if they're dead,
is a young woman.

47:05.222 --> 47:06.814
LaDonna's death earned

47:06.857 --> 47:09.087
one of the richest corporations
in the world

47:09.126 --> 47:11.686
an extra $81,000.

47:11.728 --> 47:15.061
I was faced with over $100,000
worth of medical bills

47:15.098 --> 47:18.431
and a $6,000 funeral

47:18.468 --> 47:21.926
and Wal-Mart didn't offer a penny
to help with that.

47:21.972 --> 47:25.237
I did trust them.

47:25.275 --> 47:28.540
And never in a million years
would I have ever thought

47:28.578 --> 47:31.513
that somewhere
on a profit statement,

47:31.548 --> 47:34.540
"Dead associate, $81,000."

47:34.584 --> 47:38.577
Wal-Mart doesn't care about you.

47:38.622 --> 47:40.453
When someone passes away,

47:40.490 --> 47:43.288
they shouldn't get
something out of it.

47:53.970 --> 47:56.461
The common denominator
to each form of coverage

47:56.506 --> 47:58.531
is that when the employee dies,

47:58.575 --> 48:01.806
the employer gets paid
the insurance benefits.

48:01.845 --> 48:05.008
They're often referred to
as "dead peasant insurance."

48:05.048 --> 48:08.609
Dead peasants?
Why'd they use such a creepy name?

48:08.652 --> 48:11.780
It's very creepy.
I don't know what it means either.

48:11.822 --> 48:12.982
Dead is clear.

48:13.023 --> 48:15.753
That's the worker who's passed away,
so they're dead.

48:15.792 --> 48:18.226
Peasant, I don't know why
they chose that word.

48:18.261 --> 48:20.286
I don't know if it has
some historical significance

48:20.330 --> 48:23.322
or that's just the way they view
the relative value

48:23.366 --> 48:25.095
of the employees' lives.

48:25.135 --> 48:26.727
Dead peasants?

48:26.770 --> 48:28.897
Yeah, amongst themselves
that's what they call it.

48:30.474 --> 48:34.706
It's insulting to refer
to my husband like that.

48:41.852 --> 48:43.410
It turned out that Amegy Bank

48:43.453 --> 48:46.149
had a second
dead peasant policy on Dan,

48:46.189 --> 48:50.182
bringing their total take
to nearly $5 million.

48:53.029 --> 48:55.930
- Is capitalism a sin?
- Yes.

48:55.999 --> 48:58.559
Capitalism for me and for many of us

48:58.602 --> 49:01.935
at this present moment is an evil.

49:01.972 --> 49:05.738
It's contrary to all that's good.
It's contrary to the common good.

49:05.775 --> 49:08.005
It's contrary to compassion.

49:08.044 --> 49:11.013
It's contrary to
all of the major religions.

49:11.047 --> 49:15.108
Capitalism is precisely
what the holy books,

49:15.152 --> 49:19.816
our holy books in particular,
remind us is unjust

49:19.856 --> 49:22.825
and in some form and fashion,

49:22.859 --> 49:27.626
God will come down
and eradicate somehow.

49:27.664 --> 49:29.996
This was Father Dick Preston,

49:30.033 --> 49:33.366
the priest from Flint
who married my wife and me.

49:33.403 --> 49:35.564
Capitalism is wrong,

49:35.605 --> 49:39.336
and therefore
has to be eliminated.

49:39.376 --> 49:41.367
Eliminated?

49:41.411 --> 49:43.402
That might be a little harsh,

49:43.446 --> 49:45.437
so I decided to go
and talk to the priest

49:45.482 --> 49:47.780
that married my sister
and brother-in-law.

49:47.817 --> 49:50.115
I'm sure he would have
a more balanced approach

49:50.153 --> 49:52.280
when it came to capitalism.

49:52.322 --> 49:56.258
It is immoral, it is obscene,
it is outrageous.

49:56.293 --> 49:59.023
You know...

49:59.062 --> 50:01.394
it is really radical evil.

50:01.431 --> 50:03.729
It's radically evil.

50:04.267 --> 50:07.294
Does their boss know
that they're talking like this?

50:07.337 --> 50:10.363
I thought it best to go
and check this out with the bishop.

50:10.407 --> 50:12.671
Bishop Thomas Gumbleton:
The system doesn't seem to be

50:12.709 --> 50:16.475
providing for the well being
of all the people.

50:16.513 --> 50:19.414
And that's what makes it

50:19.449 --> 50:21.917
almost in its very nature

50:21.952 --> 50:25.888
something contrary
to Jesus who said,

50:25.922 --> 50:29.449
"Blessed are the poor,
woe to the rich."

50:29.492 --> 50:32.689
That's right out
of St. Luke's gospel.

50:32.729 --> 50:35.027
How have we put up
with this system for so long?

50:35.065 --> 50:37.226
I mean, it's--
they talk about--

50:37.267 --> 50:41.636
The system has built into it
what we call propaganda.

50:41.671 --> 50:43.901
I'm in awe of propaganda--

50:43.940 --> 50:46.909
the ability to convince people

50:46.943 --> 50:49.878
who are victimized
by this very system

50:49.913 --> 50:52.882
to support the system
and see it as good.

50:52.916 --> 50:56.317
We know that American capitalism
is morally right

50:56.353 --> 50:58.514
because its chief elements--

50:58.555 --> 51:01.615
private ownership,
the profit motive

51:01.658 --> 51:04.684
and the competitive market--
are wholesome and good.

51:04.728 --> 51:08.027
They are compatible with God's laws
and the teachings of the Bible.

51:09.032 --> 51:10.932
For as long as I can remember,

51:10.967 --> 51:14.562
I've been told that competition
and profit are good things.

51:14.604 --> 51:16.697
They are compatible with God's laws

51:16.740 --> 51:17.900
and the teachings of the Bible.

51:17.941 --> 51:21.274
And if increasing profits
means locking up a few kids

51:21.311 --> 51:23.438
or cashing in on the death
of an employee...

51:23.480 --> 51:26.313
Compatible with God's laws
and the teachings of the Bible.

51:26.349 --> 51:29.614
it is morally right to provide
for the stockholders.

51:29.653 --> 51:31.985
They are compatible with God's laws

51:32.022 --> 51:33.250
and the teachings of the Bible.

51:33.290 --> 51:36.521
Debt, eviction and exploitation.

51:36.559 --> 51:40.017
God's laws and the teachings of the Bible.

51:40.063 --> 51:42.998
What were we really
pledging our allegiance to?

51:43.033 --> 51:45.968
The profit motive.

51:46.002 --> 51:48.698
And so all good Americans
came to act as if they believed

51:48.738 --> 51:51.901
our capitalist economic system
was compatible

51:51.941 --> 51:54.273
with the teachings of the Bible.

52:02.552 --> 52:06.386
When I was a kid,
I wanted to be a priest.

52:06.423 --> 52:08.220
It wasn't because
of the fancy getups

52:08.258 --> 52:10.522
or the Knights of Columbus
escorts,

52:10.560 --> 52:13.859
or even the groovy nuns
who were so good to me.

52:14.898 --> 52:18.425
It was because of the priests
who went on the march from Selma,

52:18.468 --> 52:21.028
or tried to stop the war,

52:21.071 --> 52:24.529
or devoted their lives to the poor.

52:24.574 --> 52:28.533
They told me quite clearly
what Jesus said,

52:28.578 --> 52:32.947
that the first shall be last
and the last shall be first;

52:32.982 --> 52:35.678
That the rich man
will have a very hard time

52:35.719 --> 52:37.778
getting into heaven;

52:37.821 --> 52:41.655
That we will be judged by how
we treat the least among us;

52:41.691 --> 52:44.319
And that there are no people
more important to God

52:44.361 --> 52:46.886
than the poor.

52:46.930 --> 52:49.455
Since that time,
it seems that Jesus got hijacked

52:49.499 --> 52:52.468
by a lot of people who believe
that the son of God

52:52.502 --> 52:56.871
was sent here to create
heaven on earth for the well-to-do.

52:56.906 --> 52:59.101
I must have missed
that part of the Bible

52:59.142 --> 53:02.441
where Jesus became a capitalist.

53:06.750 --> 53:08.342
Please tell me, master,

53:08.385 --> 53:11.149
what must I do
to have eternal life?

53:11.187 --> 53:14.714
Go forth and maximize profits.

53:16.559 --> 53:19.892
You say the Kingdom of Heaven
is at hand,

53:19.929 --> 53:21.453
but when exactly will it come?

53:21.498 --> 53:25.696
When you deregulate
the banking industry.

53:25.735 --> 53:28.829
Help me.

53:28.872 --> 53:31.397
I've been this way for 20 years.

53:33.243 --> 53:36.735
I'm sorry, I cannot heal
your pre-existing condition.

53:38.748 --> 53:40.409
He'll have to pay out of pocket.

53:43.820 --> 53:46.311
Somehow, I don't think
Jesus came to earth

53:46.356 --> 53:49.519
so he could ring the bell
at the New York Stock Exchange.

53:49.559 --> 53:51.550
And yet,
from the very beginning,

53:51.594 --> 53:54.427
the rich have claimed him
for their own.

53:54.464 --> 53:58.264
When I'm on Wall Street
and I realize

53:58.301 --> 54:02.431
that that's the very nerve center
of American capitalism,

54:02.472 --> 54:06.135
and I realize
what capitalism has done

54:06.176 --> 54:09.805
for working people in America,
to me that's a holy place.

54:09.846 --> 54:11.006
Let me add to it.

54:11.047 --> 54:15.074
Over the whole duration of the Iraq war
and the terror war,

54:15.118 --> 54:18.952
you look at the world's stock markets
and you look at the world economy,

54:18.988 --> 54:22.947
and despite these horrible pockets
of unrest and killing and murdering

54:22.992 --> 54:25.893
that we've been describing,
it's never been better.

54:25.929 --> 54:27.863
The global economy
has never been better

54:27.897 --> 54:30.525
and the global stock markets
have never been better, Jimmy.

54:30.567 --> 54:32.592
It is either a God-given miracle

54:32.635 --> 54:34.603
or it has something to do
with the victories

54:34.637 --> 54:37.003
of the spreading world
of capitalism or both.

54:37.040 --> 54:38.974
They think
Wall Street's a holy place.

54:39.008 --> 54:41.943
What do you think
Jesus would think of capitalism?

54:41.978 --> 54:46.347
I think he would
simply refuse to--

54:46.382 --> 54:49.619
to be part of it.

54:50.787 --> 54:53.654
Jesus would refuse
to be part of it,

54:53.690 --> 54:55.658
but he probably had
a special place up there

54:55.692 --> 54:58.627
for whoever leaked
a secret Citibank memo

54:58.661 --> 55:02.028
about their plan to rule the world.

55:02.065 --> 55:04.056
Back in 2005 and 2006,

55:04.100 --> 55:06.432
Citigroup wrote
3 confidential memos

55:06.469 --> 55:10.929
to their wealthiest investors
about how things were going.

55:10.974 --> 55:13.374
They reached the conclusion
that the United States

55:13.409 --> 55:15.639
was no longer
really a democracy,

55:15.678 --> 55:18.442
but had become a plutonomy--

55:18.481 --> 55:21.575
a society controlled exclusively
by and for the benefit

55:21.618 --> 55:24.712
of the top 1 %
of the population

55:24.754 --> 55:26.847
who now had
more financial wealth

55:26.890 --> 55:30.519
than the bottom 95% combined.

55:30.560 --> 55:33.791
The memo gloated about the growing gap
between rich and poor

55:33.830 --> 55:37.288
and how they were now
the new aristocracy

55:37.333 --> 55:41.269
and that there was no end in sight
for the gravy train they were on.

55:41.304 --> 55:44.865
There was, though,
one problem.

55:44.908 --> 55:46.432
According to Citigroup,

55:46.476 --> 55:49.070
the most potent
and short-term threat

55:49.112 --> 55:50.909
would be societies demanding

55:50.947 --> 55:53.541
a more equitable share
of the wealth.

55:53.583 --> 55:57.952
In other words,
the peasants might revolt.

55:57.987 --> 56:00.353
Citigroup lamented
that the non-rich

56:00.390 --> 56:02.858
might not have
much economic power,

56:02.892 --> 56:06.419
but they do have
equal voting power with the rich.

56:06.462 --> 56:09.431
One person, one vote.

56:09.465 --> 56:12.127
And that's what
really scares them--

56:12.168 --> 56:14.602
that we can still vote.

56:14.637 --> 56:17.936
In fact, we have
99% of the votes

56:17.974 --> 56:20.772
and they only have 1%.

56:23.846 --> 56:27.805
So why do the 99%
put up with this?

56:27.850 --> 56:31.286
According to Citigroup,
it's because the majority of the electorate

56:31.321 --> 56:33.812
believe that someday
they will have a chance

56:33.856 --> 56:36.381
of becoming
well-to-do themselves

56:36.426 --> 56:39.589
if they just keep trying
hard enough.

56:41.931 --> 56:44.229
The wealthy were pleased
that so many people

56:44.267 --> 56:47.100
had bought in
to the American Dream

56:47.136 --> 56:50.196
while they, the rich,
had no intention

56:50.239 --> 56:53.140
of ever sharing it with anyone.

56:53.176 --> 56:56.475
I think capitalism is a lot more
important than democracy.

56:56.512 --> 56:58.878
I'm not even a big believer
in democracy.

56:58.915 --> 57:02.510
I always say that democracy is--
can be 2 wolves and a sheep

57:02.552 --> 57:04.213
deciding on what to have
for dinner.

57:04.253 --> 57:07.484
This is Stephen Moore--
no relation--

57:07.523 --> 57:09.957
a columnist
and an editorial board member

57:09.993 --> 57:11.756
of "The Wall Street Journal,"

57:11.794 --> 57:15.230
the daily bible
of corporate America.

57:15.264 --> 57:18.324
Look, I'm in favor of people
having the right to vote

57:18.368 --> 57:20.836
and things like that, but you know
there are a lot of countries

57:20.870 --> 57:24.738
that have the right to vote
that are still poor.

57:24.774 --> 57:28.141
Democracy doesn't always lead
to a good economy

57:28.177 --> 57:30.111
or even a good political system.

57:30.146 --> 57:33.513
With capitalism, you are free
to do what you want,

57:33.549 --> 57:35.608
to make whatever you want
out of yourself.

57:35.652 --> 57:37.176
It doesn't mean
you're gonna succeed.

57:37.220 --> 57:41.623
Remember, the US Constitution
does not guarantee happiness.

57:42.258 --> 57:44.286
The Constitution.

57:44.327 --> 57:48.093
All my life I've heard that America
is a capitalist country.

57:48.131 --> 57:52.397
So I went to see the original Constitution
and check out if it was true.

57:52.435 --> 57:55.871
I'm trying to see where it sets up
our economic system,

57:55.905 --> 57:59.136
like where it says we have
a capitalist economy.

57:59.175 --> 58:01.336
The jurisdiction.

58:01.377 --> 58:03.174
- Judicial part of the--
- Down there?

58:03.212 --> 58:07.012
There was no mention
of free market or free enterprise

58:07.050 --> 58:09.644
or capitalism anywhere.

58:10.687 --> 58:13.952
In fact, all I saw was
"We the people,"

58:13.990 --> 58:16.584
something about
"a more perfect union,"

58:16.626 --> 58:19.993
and "promoting
the general welfare."

58:20.029 --> 58:24.523
Welfare, union, we?

58:24.567 --> 58:26.967
That sounded like that other -ism.

58:27.003 --> 58:30.439
But no, that's democracy.

58:30.473 --> 58:33.175
And I began to wonder,
"What would it be like

58:33.242 --> 58:36.575
if the workplace
was a democracy?"

58:36.612 --> 58:39.945
There's always been a big separation
between how the country is run

58:39.982 --> 58:43.213
and how businesses
are supposed to run.

58:43.252 --> 58:44.446
It's true.

58:44.487 --> 58:46.352
There seems to be a disconnect

58:46.389 --> 58:48.721
between our professed love
of democracy

58:48.758 --> 58:51.784
and how we're so willing
to accept a dictatorship

58:51.828 --> 58:54.695
every day we show up to work.

58:54.731 --> 58:58.531
It's not that way
at Isthmus Engineering in Wisconsin.

58:58.568 --> 59:02.402
They design and build
robotic machines for industry.

59:02.438 --> 59:05.601
It's a $15 million-a-year business.

59:05.641 --> 59:07.438
All of the workers

59:07.477 --> 59:10.810
are the owners of the business.

59:10.847 --> 59:14.408
He's not talking about
some bullshit stock option.

59:14.450 --> 59:17.851
He means they're the true owners.

59:17.887 --> 59:20.720
And it's a democratically-run
operation where every member

59:20.757 --> 59:23.726
has one vote and an equal say.

59:23.760 --> 59:26.024
- All in favor?
- All in favor?

59:26.062 --> 59:29.088
It takes the money
out of the equation.

59:29.132 --> 59:31.157
By taking the money
out of the equation

59:31.200 --> 59:33.430
so that they can call the shots,

59:33.469 --> 59:35.801
they end up making more money.

59:35.838 --> 59:37.466
Cool?

59:42.145 --> 59:44.943
And how patriotic
that they want to extend

59:44.981 --> 59:48.815
their love of American democracy
to their job.

59:55.124 --> 59:57.058
Just imagine if the place
where you worked

59:57.093 --> 01:00:00.256
was run by you
and your fellow workers.

01:00:00.296 --> 01:00:02.161
You probably wouldn't
lay off your coworkers

01:00:02.198 --> 01:00:05.133
to increase the value
of your stock, would you?

01:00:05.168 --> 01:00:06.635
Or give yourself
a pay raise

01:00:06.669 --> 01:00:09.536
while making your coworkers
take a pay cut.

01:00:09.572 --> 01:00:11.437
We don't really do that here.

01:00:11.474 --> 01:00:15.069
You really can't because everyone else
would be looking at you

01:00:15.111 --> 01:00:17.671
saying, "Why is this guy
so fricking greedy?"

01:00:17.713 --> 01:00:20.307
You know,
it would be too obvious.

01:00:20.349 --> 01:00:22.214
The bottom line is you've
got plenty of people

01:00:22.251 --> 01:00:24.048
who roll up their sleeves
every day and go to work.

01:00:24.086 --> 01:00:25.986
But if there's someone
way up there on the chain

01:00:26.022 --> 01:00:29.048
that collects all the extra money,
that's not fair.

01:00:30.291 --> 01:00:32.857
Fairness in the workplace--

01:00:32.895 --> 01:00:35.227
what a novel idea.

01:00:36.666 --> 01:00:39.897
Out in California,
there's a bread factory

01:00:39.936 --> 01:00:43.497
where workers make thousands
of loaves of bread every day

01:00:43.539 --> 01:00:45.530
The more hours you work towards

01:00:45.575 --> 01:00:46.872
the benefit
of the co-op,

01:00:46.909 --> 01:00:49.776
the more you share
in the profits.

01:00:49.812 --> 01:00:52.007
The workers are happy here.

01:00:52.048 --> 01:00:54.516
No big Is, little yous.
Everyone's the same.

01:00:54.550 --> 01:00:58.042
Me as the CEO,
I get the same share

01:00:58.087 --> 01:01:00.112
that anybody else does.

01:01:00.156 --> 01:01:01.953
And that has proven

01:01:01.991 --> 01:01:04.323
to be very lucrative
for us as workers.

01:01:06.162 --> 01:01:10.724
Assembly-line workers here
earn over $65,000 a year,

01:01:10.766 --> 01:01:12.859
more than 3 times the pay

01:01:12.902 --> 01:01:15.462
for a starting pilot
at American Eagle.

01:01:15.504 --> 01:01:18.302
I'm just hoping
that people take notice

01:01:18.341 --> 01:01:20.502
of this type
of organizational activity

01:01:20.543 --> 01:01:23.944
and start considering it
as an alternative.

01:01:23.980 --> 01:01:25.311
Why do you want
to get rich?

01:01:25.348 --> 01:01:27.282
How many cars do
you really need in life?

01:01:27.316 --> 01:01:31.912
Clearly, he's not a car guy,
but that's okay.

01:01:31.954 --> 01:01:35.481
His bread factory and hundreds of other
worker-owned businesses

01:01:35.524 --> 01:01:39.119
are proof that people aren't always
motivated by profit.

01:01:41.998 --> 01:01:44.626
An historic victory over a dread disease.

01:01:44.667 --> 01:01:48.034
Instead of using his genius
to make a ton of money,

01:01:48.070 --> 01:01:51.335
Dr. Jonas Salk spent
all of his time

01:01:51.374 --> 01:01:53.865
putting monkey kidneys
in a blender

01:01:53.910 --> 01:01:55.969
trying to find a cure
for polio.

01:01:56.012 --> 01:02:00.881
And when he did,
he decided to give it away for free.

01:02:00.917 --> 01:02:03.977
This man could have been rich
many times over

01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:07.353
had he sold his vaccine
to a pharmaceutical company.

01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:09.824
But he thought
his talents should be used

01:02:09.859 --> 01:02:11.053
for the greater good.

01:02:11.093 --> 01:02:14.028
And the decent salary
he made as a doctor

01:02:14.063 --> 01:02:16.463
and a research professor
was enough for him to live

01:02:16.499 --> 01:02:18.558
a comfortable life.

01:02:18.601 --> 01:02:21.001
Who owns the patent
on this vaccine?

01:02:21.037 --> 01:02:23.005
Well, the people,
I would say.

01:02:23.039 --> 01:02:26.600
There is no patent.
Would you patent the sun?

01:02:26.642 --> 01:02:30.476
Yes, we've come a long way
since the days of Dr. Salk.

01:02:30.513 --> 01:02:34.643
Because today our best minds
are used for something else.

01:02:35.084 --> 01:02:38.801
Where do we send our top
math and science people?

01:02:39.054 --> 01:02:40.085
Into finance.

01:02:40.122 --> 01:02:42.590
They don't go into
science in America.

01:02:42.625 --> 01:02:45.321
They go to Wall Street.

01:02:45.361 --> 01:02:48.421
Today's students,
unlike in Dr. Salk's time,

01:02:48.464 --> 01:02:51.024
can graduate from college
with a student loan debt

01:02:51.067 --> 01:02:54.093
of up to $100,000 or more.

01:02:54.136 --> 01:02:56.434
These students are then
beholden to the banks

01:02:56.472 --> 01:02:59.441
for the next 20 years.

01:02:59.475 --> 01:03:02.308
And the best way for them
to pay off these banks

01:03:02.345 --> 01:03:04.279
is to go to work for them

01:03:04.313 --> 01:03:06.941
instead of working
for the common good.

01:03:06.983 --> 01:03:11.352
We've taken people that could
be enormously productive--

01:03:11.387 --> 01:03:13.014
just what we're short of
in America--

01:03:13.055 --> 01:03:16.081
and we take them and we
put them in an activity

01:03:16.125 --> 01:03:18.116
that isn't simply less
productive,

01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:20.958
but where they're
actually destructive;

01:03:20.997 --> 01:03:24.797
where actually every day they work,
they make the world worse.

01:03:24.834 --> 01:03:27.894
So what exactly were the top
students from Harvard

01:03:27.937 --> 01:03:29.928
and other schools
working on these days?

01:03:29.972 --> 01:03:31.997
Derivatives... derivatives...
derivatives... derivatives...

01:03:32.041 --> 01:03:34.441
Credit default swaps.

01:03:34.477 --> 01:03:36.502
I can't make any sense
out of this.

01:03:36.545 --> 01:03:38.308
I might as well quit.

01:03:38.397 --> 01:03:40.097
That's exactly how I felt

01:03:40.190 --> 01:03:42.351
when I started hearing
these new terms.

01:03:42.393 --> 01:03:46.523
So I went down to the New York Stock
Exchange to get some answers.

01:03:46.563 --> 01:03:48.292
Sir, can you explain
derivatives to me?

01:03:48.332 --> 01:03:50.562
Can anybody explain
derivatives or credit default swaps?

01:03:50.601 --> 01:03:51.829
Can someone explain
to me what these are?

01:03:51.869 --> 01:03:54.099
Sir, can you tell me what
a credit default swap is?

01:03:54.138 --> 01:03:55.662
Can you explain
a derivative to me?

01:03:55.706 --> 01:03:57.173
Can you tell me
what a derivative is?

01:03:57.207 --> 01:03:59.471
- Nobody'll talk to me.
- I'm just a blue-collar guy.

01:03:59.510 --> 01:04:01.171
I can see that.
Hey.

01:04:01.211 --> 01:04:03.736
- I'm looking for some advice.
- Yeah, good.

01:04:03.781 --> 01:04:06.909
You guys got any
advice for me here?

01:04:06.951 --> 01:04:08.942
A derivative?
Credit default swap?

01:04:10.487 --> 01:04:13.012
I did find one guy on Wall Street

01:04:13.057 --> 01:04:14.888
who wasn't a film critic.

01:04:14.925 --> 01:04:18.292
Marcus Haupt is an Ivy League
educated engineer

01:04:18.329 --> 01:04:20.957
who was a vice president
of Lehman Brothers

01:04:20.998 --> 01:04:23.489
and spent 15 years
on Wall Street

01:04:23.534 --> 01:04:26.560
creating what they call
complex financial instruments.

01:04:26.603 --> 01:04:28.093
What is a derivative?

01:04:28.138 --> 01:04:30.231
A derivative
is a secondary bet

01:04:30.274 --> 01:04:32.071
on an underlying product.

01:04:32.109 --> 01:04:34.134
So you may have a stock
and you have an option on that stock.

01:04:34.178 --> 01:04:37.409
And that option on that stock
allows you the privilege

01:04:37.448 --> 01:04:39.814
but not the obligation
to buy or sell.

01:04:39.850 --> 01:04:42.876
How should we put this?
You are allowed to make a decision

01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:45.411
of whether or not you want to ultimately
take that exposure.

01:04:45.456 --> 01:04:48.016
Let me explain it another way.
The derivative's price

01:04:48.058 --> 01:04:50.049
is based on the price
of something else.

01:04:50.094 --> 01:04:52.028
It's kind of like
a second-degree equation.

01:04:52.062 --> 01:04:54.792
If you think of,
let's say...

01:04:55.432 --> 01:04:58.268
maybe I should go back.

01:04:58.302 --> 01:05:00.463
Let me start this over again.
Let's go back here.

01:05:01.538 --> 01:05:04.132
I was lost.

01:05:04.174 --> 01:05:06.870
Maybe there's someone
at Harvard University

01:05:06.910 --> 01:05:08.537
who could explain it to me.

01:05:08.579 --> 01:05:11.013
Yeah, the-- the-- the--

01:05:11.048 --> 01:05:13.983
the-- the-- the--
the buyer--

01:05:14.018 --> 01:05:17.181
so the seller holds the loan
and it might default.

01:05:17.221 --> 01:05:20.418
And they sell off--

01:05:20.457 --> 01:05:23.221
somebody-- somebody else--

01:05:23.260 --> 01:05:26.229
Sorry, let me just back up.

01:05:26.263 --> 01:05:29.960
I apologize.
These are pretty exotic.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.025
Derivatives are nothing more

01:05:32.069 --> 01:05:34.299
than complicated
betting schemes.

01:05:34.338 --> 01:05:37.273
Here's what the math equation
of one looks like.

01:05:37.307 --> 01:05:39.138
Can't figure it out?

01:05:39.176 --> 01:05:41.667
That's okay.
You're not supposed to.

01:05:41.712 --> 01:05:43.976
They've made them
purposely confusing

01:05:44.014 --> 01:05:46.073
so they can get away
with murder.

01:05:46.116 --> 01:05:48.084
Let's say you're a lawyer
and you're coming in

01:05:48.118 --> 01:05:49.949
and you're from the government
and you're trying to evaluate

01:05:49.987 --> 01:05:52.478
if these things
violate the tax code or not.

01:05:52.523 --> 01:05:54.423
If you can figure out
what they're doing,

01:05:54.458 --> 01:05:56.790
most likely that Wall Street
firm will offer you a job.

01:05:56.827 --> 01:06:00.354
Could I go to Wall Street
and just ask them

01:06:00.397 --> 01:06:02.490
to set up a derivative
on anything?

01:06:02.533 --> 01:06:03.932
Yes.

01:06:03.967 --> 01:06:05.434
Believe me,
if it's out there

01:06:05.469 --> 01:06:07.061
there's a derivative on it.

01:06:07.104 --> 01:06:09.595
So this is what Wall Street has come to--

01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:12.108
an insane casino.

01:06:12.142 --> 01:06:14.633
We've allowed them
to bet on anything,

01:06:14.678 --> 01:06:17.915
including our family home.

01:06:24.021 --> 01:06:26.990
...the most powerful central
banker of the 20th century.

01:06:27.024 --> 01:06:29.288
Greenspan has become an economic icon.

01:06:29.326 --> 01:06:32.557
Alan Greenspan says
the economy is hunky-dory.

01:06:32.596 --> 01:06:34.996
Greenspan gone wild.
It's like "Girls Gone Wild."

01:06:35.032 --> 01:06:37.899
What do Mick Jagger
and Alan Greenspan have in common?

01:06:37.935 --> 01:06:41.200
Alan Greenspan,
who at that moment in time

01:06:41.238 --> 01:06:43.433
was surely thought to be
the smartest man

01:06:43.474 --> 01:06:45.237
who had walked the face
of the earth,

01:06:45.275 --> 01:06:48.403
he starts using a phrase,
"tap your home equity,"

01:06:48.445 --> 01:06:51.278
--that Americans can tap
their home equity,

01:06:51.315 --> 01:06:53.545
which is just
Alan Greenspan-speak

01:06:53.584 --> 01:06:56.519
for "borrow against
your home."

01:06:56.553 --> 01:06:58.748
And if you can't repay it
you'll lose your house.

01:06:58.789 --> 01:07:02.953
It actually started by talking
mostly older Americans,

01:07:02.993 --> 01:07:04.517
people who already
had homes,

01:07:04.561 --> 01:07:07.428
into refinancing
their homes

01:07:07.464 --> 01:07:09.227
to get them out of houses.

01:07:09.266 --> 01:07:13.100
Yes, get senior citizens
out of their houses.

01:07:13.137 --> 01:07:16.129
The scam to swindle people
out of the homes

01:07:16.173 --> 01:07:19.165
they already owned
was masterful.

01:07:19.209 --> 01:07:21.734
Here's how it worked.

01:07:21.778 --> 01:07:25.441
First, tell these homeowners
that they own a bank.

01:07:25.482 --> 01:07:28.451
And that bank is your home.

01:07:28.485 --> 01:07:32.216
So if your home
is worth $250,000,

01:07:32.256 --> 01:07:35.316
that makes you
a quarter millionaire.

01:07:35.359 --> 01:07:37.725
You're sitting
on a goldmine.

01:07:37.761 --> 01:07:40.662
You own your own bank.

01:07:40.697 --> 01:07:42.995
The bank of you.

01:07:43.033 --> 01:07:46.400
And you can use your bank
to get more money.

01:07:46.436 --> 01:07:47.903
Just refinance.

01:07:47.938 --> 01:07:49.633
Everyone's doing it.

01:07:49.673 --> 01:07:52.972
Of course hidden in the dozens
or hundreds of pages of fine print

01:07:53.010 --> 01:07:55.274
are tricky clauses that allow the bank
to raise your interest rate

01:07:55.312 --> 01:07:56.973
to a number
you didn't know about,

01:07:57.014 --> 01:07:59.039
perhaps so high that you won't
be able to repay your loan.

01:07:59.082 --> 01:08:00.811
But that's okay.

01:08:00.851 --> 01:08:04.309
If you can't pay it
we'll just take your house.

01:08:06.823 --> 01:08:09.155
Of course, before they
could take your house

01:08:09.193 --> 01:08:12.162
they needed to change
the regulations and the rules.

01:08:12.196 --> 01:08:15.029
What's this photo I found here?

01:08:15.065 --> 01:08:17.693
It was in an annual
report of the FDIC.

01:08:17.734 --> 01:08:22.228
John Gilleran, the head of the Office
of Thrift Supervision,

01:08:22.272 --> 01:08:23.796
which is supposed to regulate
savings and loans,

01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:26.138
he's the guy
with the chainsaw.

01:08:26.176 --> 01:08:28.542
And the 4 other
grinning idiots

01:08:28.578 --> 01:08:33.107
in the photo are the
3 leading lobbyists in banking

01:08:33.149 --> 01:08:37.109
and the deputy director of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation.

01:08:37.154 --> 01:08:41.113
And they're poised over
a pile of regulations.

01:08:41.158 --> 01:08:42.921
And this is supposed
to demonstrate

01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:46.054
their intention
to destroy regulation.

01:08:46.095 --> 01:08:48.564
And they succeeded.

01:08:48.599 --> 01:08:50.464
And now we know what happens

01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:52.627
when you destroy
financial regulation.

01:08:52.669 --> 01:08:55.035
You produce a financial
catastrophe.

01:08:55.072 --> 01:08:57.700
A growing family
with a lot of debt;

01:08:57.741 --> 01:08:59.902
A young couple
with no down payment;

01:08:59.943 --> 01:09:02.969
A business owner whose
income was hard to document;

01:09:03.013 --> 01:09:05.982
Every one of them was
turned down for a home loan

01:09:06.015 --> 01:09:07.573
by 3 different lenders.

01:09:07.618 --> 01:09:10.883
I'm with Countrywide
and I got them all approved.

01:09:10.921 --> 01:09:13.912
Don't be fooled by the pleasant demeanor

01:09:13.957 --> 01:09:15.618
and blonde hair.

01:09:15.658 --> 01:09:18.059
It's the same pitch
the mafia gives you

01:09:18.095 --> 01:09:19.892
in the neighborhood.

01:09:19.930 --> 01:09:21.453
I know how you feel.

01:09:21.497 --> 01:09:23.488
You got a lot of debt.

01:09:23.533 --> 01:09:25.694
You don't have any money
for the down payment.

01:09:25.736 --> 01:09:28.102
You can't find
your documents.

01:09:28.138 --> 01:09:31.335
It's okay.
I'll make you a loan you can't refuse.

01:09:31.375 --> 01:09:33.240
It's called subprime.

01:09:33.277 --> 01:09:35.575
You pay no interest now.

01:09:35.612 --> 01:09:37.910
You pay a little more later.

01:09:37.948 --> 01:09:41.406
Don't worry about later.
We'll take care of you.

01:09:41.451 --> 01:09:44.613
And like the mafia,
Countrywide,

01:09:44.654 --> 01:09:48.283
Citibank, Wells Fargo,
Chase...

01:09:48.325 --> 01:09:50.122
Let's go.

01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:52.594
they would someday
stop by to collect

01:09:52.629 --> 01:09:55.462
and take your home.

01:09:57.834 --> 01:10:01.463
I was paying 1,700 a month and making it.

01:10:01.505 --> 01:10:04.133
Then it went to 2,000.
Then it went to 2,300.

01:10:04.174 --> 01:10:06.267
Then it went to 2,700.

01:10:06.310 --> 01:10:08.244
Can't do it.

01:10:12.049 --> 01:10:16.076
These are the Hackers
of Peoria, Illinois.

01:10:16.119 --> 01:10:18.713
Randy is a railroad worker

01:10:18.755 --> 01:10:21.519
and Donna works
for retirement homes.

01:10:21.558 --> 01:10:25.426
Their farm, which had been
in the family for over 4 decades,

01:10:25.462 --> 01:10:28.829
had been foreclosed
on by Citibank.

01:10:28.865 --> 01:10:31.663
Randy had had an accident
on the job years ago

01:10:31.702 --> 01:10:33.465
and was now
on disability.

01:10:36.073 --> 01:10:40.737
They absolutely just plain
fucking stole everything,

01:10:40.777 --> 01:10:42.768
my whole life's savings
and everything,

01:10:42.813 --> 01:10:46.681
by a stroke of a pen
and a lawyer and a judge.

01:10:46.717 --> 01:10:50.050
The Hackers showed me
the foreclosure notice from Citibank.

01:10:50.087 --> 01:10:51.714
What caught my eye

01:10:51.755 --> 01:10:54.485
was the town from which
their mortgage came.

01:10:54.524 --> 01:10:58.153
It turns out that a company
owned by the big banks

01:10:58.195 --> 01:11:01.130
has chosen to run
60 million mortgages through,

01:11:01.164 --> 01:11:04.463
of all places, one of
the most desperate towns

01:11:04.501 --> 01:11:06.162
in the United States.

01:11:06.203 --> 01:11:08.671
This company hires
the people of Flint

01:11:08.705 --> 01:11:11.071
to send out nearly 60%

01:11:11.108 --> 01:11:14.407
of all the foreclosure
notices in the country.

01:11:14.444 --> 01:11:17.675
In what seems to be some
sort of cruel joke,

01:11:17.714 --> 01:11:20.182
my hometown was now
in the service

01:11:20.217 --> 01:11:22.651
of helping to turn
the rest of America

01:11:22.686 --> 01:11:24.813
into Flint.

01:11:29.059 --> 01:11:32.051
Typically when a bank forces
a family like the Hackers

01:11:32.095 --> 01:11:34.757
out of their home
they hire professionals

01:11:34.798 --> 01:11:36.561
to come and clean up
the place.

01:11:38.001 --> 01:11:40.265
In this case,
the bank figured,

01:11:40.303 --> 01:11:44.034
why pay top dollar when
we've got a desperate family

01:11:44.074 --> 01:11:46.099
who will work cheap?

01:11:46.143 --> 01:11:48.270
In a final humiliation

01:11:48.311 --> 01:11:50.506
the Hackers went
to work for the bank

01:11:50.547 --> 01:11:52.412
that took their home.

01:11:54.384 --> 01:11:57.114
"Property is to be turned over
in broom-clean condition

01:11:57.154 --> 01:12:00.089
with all trash, debris
and personal property removed.

01:12:01.925 --> 01:12:03.893
Upon delivery of the keys

01:12:03.927 --> 01:12:07.522
the PAS representative will
hand you a check for $1,000."

01:12:13.170 --> 01:12:16.367
You know, 1,000 bucks

01:12:16.406 --> 01:12:19.842
to get out
of my own house and stuff,

01:12:19.876 --> 01:12:22.936
I really want to thank them.
That was really something.

01:12:22.979 --> 01:12:25.743
My wife worked for a week
to clean the house up

01:12:25.782 --> 01:12:27.909
and make sure it was
presentable to somebody else.

01:12:27.951 --> 01:12:30.579
I'm glad they did that.
I have to thank them.

01:12:30.620 --> 01:12:32.588
It was awful nice of them.

01:12:32.622 --> 01:12:35.352
Yeah, I'd like to
thank them all right.

01:12:44.367 --> 01:12:46.961
I have one more.

01:12:49.706 --> 01:12:52.036
That goes to our bedroom door.

01:12:52.075 --> 01:12:54.134
Trying to think what--

01:12:54.177 --> 01:12:56.475
that goes that that.
I had a lock on it

01:12:56.513 --> 01:12:58.413
to keep kids out
'cause I have guns.

01:12:58.448 --> 01:13:00.780
And here's your money, Randy.

01:13:00.817 --> 01:13:03.411
What you're witnessing

01:13:03.453 --> 01:13:04.977
is a robbery.

01:13:06.423 --> 01:13:09.915
I'm starting to understand
why people,

01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:12.724
they lose their minds
and start shooting people.

01:13:12.762 --> 01:13:15.287
I'm not gonna say I would
do something like that,

01:13:15.332 --> 01:13:17.857
but I can see how
they get people

01:13:17.901 --> 01:13:20.096
into that situation where

01:13:20.136 --> 01:13:23.594
people go in there with bombs
and blow them up

01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:25.574
and shoot at them.

01:13:25.609 --> 01:13:27.702
Anything that happens to them
people, they deserve it,

01:13:27.744 --> 01:13:29.507
is all I can say.

01:13:29.546 --> 01:13:31.741
I hope something happens--

01:13:31.781 --> 01:13:34.978
yeah, well.

01:13:35.018 --> 01:13:37.282
Can't say no more.

01:13:41.992 --> 01:13:44.119
Some roadkill right there.

01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:45.889
This is Bob Feinberg.

01:13:45.929 --> 01:13:49.695
He handled all the VIP loans
for Countrywide,

01:13:49.733 --> 01:13:53.669
the nation's largest
mortgage company.

01:13:53.703 --> 01:13:55.637
Although Countrywide
mainly specializes

01:13:55.672 --> 01:13:59.073
in outrageously high interest
loans for low income people,

01:13:59.109 --> 01:14:01.407
Bob's job was to take care of

01:14:01.444 --> 01:14:05.210
some of the country's
top political leaders.

01:14:05.248 --> 01:14:07.842
One day one of the bigger
bosses called me in the office.

01:14:07.884 --> 01:14:09.613
He said,
"I want you to call this guy."

01:14:09.653 --> 01:14:11.621
I said okay.

01:14:11.655 --> 01:14:14.590
And he said,
"He's a friend of Angelo's."

01:14:14.624 --> 01:14:17.092
Angelo Mozilo's the CEO
of Countrywide.

01:14:17.127 --> 01:14:21.291
"Give him this rate.
Waive these fees.

01:14:21.331 --> 01:14:25.358
And get it locked in.
And don't fuck it up."

01:14:25.402 --> 01:14:28.166
And I was like,
"Oh, okay."

01:14:29.839 --> 01:14:31.500
So it was
a special department

01:14:31.541 --> 01:14:34.169
that handled friends
of Angelo.

01:14:35.545 --> 01:14:37.012
Discounts were being given.

01:14:37.047 --> 01:14:38.639
Fees were being waived.

01:14:38.682 --> 01:14:41.708
And at times paperwork
was being waived.

01:14:41.751 --> 01:14:45.847
We literally would
write on the file "FOA."

01:14:45.889 --> 01:14:48.619
These were really
important people.

01:14:48.658 --> 01:14:51.354
I had Richard Holbrooke--
Ambassador Holbrooke,

01:14:51.394 --> 01:14:53.589
Donna Shalala,

01:14:53.630 --> 01:14:56.793
people on Capitol Hill, people that
regulate the mortgage markets,

01:14:56.833 --> 01:14:59.097
people that regulate
Wall Street,

01:14:59.135 --> 01:15:02.366
and Jim Johnson,
head of Fannie Mae,

01:15:02.405 --> 01:15:05.272
Alphonso Jackson
the secretary of HUD...

01:15:06.876 --> 01:15:09.868
Senator Conrad from
the Finance Committee.

01:15:09.913 --> 01:15:12.939
I had the TV on in my house.
I was in the kitchen

01:15:12.983 --> 01:15:15.178
and I heard a voice
pontificating

01:15:15.218 --> 01:15:18.051
about predatory lending
and how we have to put an end to it.

01:15:18.088 --> 01:15:20.352
Our nation's financial regulators

01:15:20.390 --> 01:15:22.119
are supposed to
be the cops on the beat

01:15:22.158 --> 01:15:24.558
protecting working Americans

01:15:24.594 --> 01:15:26.323
from unscrupulous
financial actions.

01:15:26.363 --> 01:15:29.059
Senator Dodd--
Christopher Dodd-- was speaking.

01:15:29.099 --> 01:15:32.762
And I just stared at
the television and I was upset.

01:15:32.802 --> 01:15:35.327
Some of these loans
have legitimate uses,

01:15:35.372 --> 01:15:37.397
when made to sophisticated
borrowers

01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:39.567
with higher incomes.

01:15:39.609 --> 01:15:42.305
I had done a number
of loans for him

01:15:42.345 --> 01:15:45.075
in which he got discounts
and all the things

01:15:45.115 --> 01:15:46.878
that go with being
a friend of Angelo's

01:15:46.916 --> 01:15:48.440
and all the good stuff.

01:15:48.485 --> 01:15:50.453
The Senate Banking
and Housing Committee

01:15:50.487 --> 01:15:53.115
is supposed to be the watchdog
of the mortgage industry.

01:15:53.156 --> 01:15:56.421
Senator Dodd is the chairman
of this committee

01:15:56.459 --> 01:15:59.087
and has served on it
for over 28 years.

01:15:59.129 --> 01:16:01.359
As a friend of Angelo

01:16:01.398 --> 01:16:04.094
he received
over $1 million worth

01:16:04.134 --> 01:16:06.728
of discounted loans
from Countrywide.

01:16:06.770 --> 01:16:10.536
Someone next door here
is selling a toxic

01:16:10.573 --> 01:16:12.803
piece of crap
loan to somebody.

01:16:12.842 --> 01:16:16.676
I was required to give the most
suitable loan to that VIP.

01:16:16.713 --> 01:16:18.578
Did you ever feel that

01:16:18.615 --> 01:16:20.708
what you were doing
might be bribery?

01:16:20.750 --> 01:16:23.719
I didn't feel like I was
bribing anybody, no.

01:16:23.753 --> 01:16:27.211
I was just doing my job.
I was the VIP guy.

01:16:27.257 --> 01:16:28.986
Everyone in the company
knew who I was.

01:16:29.025 --> 01:16:30.686
You know, everyone.

01:16:30.727 --> 01:16:33.287
So it was kind of
a flattering situation.

01:16:33.329 --> 01:16:36.821
But no, I don't feel like I did
anything wrong at all.

01:16:36.866 --> 01:16:39.926
And if I didn't do it, somebody else
would have been doing it.

01:16:41.805 --> 01:16:44.330
That's why we need people like Bill Black,

01:16:44.374 --> 01:16:46.535
one of the bank regulators
who uncovered

01:16:46.576 --> 01:16:48.806
the Savings & Loan scandal
in the 1980s.

01:16:48.845 --> 01:16:50.972
Something improper happened

01:16:51.014 --> 01:16:53.312
and I bet you
the regulators know.

01:16:53.349 --> 01:16:56.284
One of the leading figures of
that scandal, Charles Keating,

01:16:56.319 --> 01:16:59.117
had an idea on what to do
with Bill Black

01:16:59.155 --> 01:17:01.646
and sent a memo out
with these instructions.

01:17:02.826 --> 01:17:05.852
I asked him who was
looking out for us today.

01:17:05.895 --> 01:17:08.523
Where was the FBI in all of this?

01:17:08.565 --> 01:17:11.295
The FBI began publicly warning

01:17:11.334 --> 01:17:13.825
in September 2004

01:17:13.870 --> 01:17:17.101
that there was an epidemic
of mortgage fraud

01:17:17.140 --> 01:17:19.335
perpetrated by the banks.

01:17:19.375 --> 01:17:21.036
Epidemic was their word.

01:17:21.077 --> 01:17:23.773
But when 9/11 hit,

01:17:23.813 --> 01:17:27.044
the Bush administration
transferred

01:17:27.083 --> 01:17:31.144
at least 500 white-collar
FBI specialists

01:17:31.187 --> 01:17:33.985
out of dealing
with white-collar crime,

01:17:34.023 --> 01:17:36.457
even though we were entering

01:17:36.493 --> 01:17:38.461
during the entire
Bush administration

01:17:38.495 --> 01:17:41.055
the greatest wave
of white-collar crime

01:17:41.097 --> 01:17:44.624
in the nation's history,
in fact, in the world's history.

01:17:44.667 --> 01:17:47.864
The FBI says that 80%

01:17:47.904 --> 01:17:49.895
of the mortgage fraud losses

01:17:49.939 --> 01:17:52.772
are induced by lender personnel.

01:17:52.809 --> 01:17:54.106
Meaning what?

01:17:54.144 --> 01:17:56.578
Meaning not the borrower

01:17:56.613 --> 01:17:59.741
coming off the street trying
to defraud the savings and loan.

01:17:59.783 --> 01:18:03.651
These are frauds led by whoever
controls the organization.

01:18:03.686 --> 01:18:06.348
- Right.
- It's typically the CEO in other words.

01:18:06.389 --> 01:18:09.415
So did these CEOs
think they were gonna get away with it?

01:18:09.459 --> 01:18:11.620
They have gotten
away with it.

01:18:13.329 --> 01:18:15.422
Yes, apparently they did.

01:18:15.465 --> 01:18:18.229
And with the presidential
election just around the corner...

01:18:18.268 --> 01:18:21.533
- Define rich.
- 5 million.

01:18:21.571 --> 01:18:25.371
the elites were worried that their crime
spree might come to an end.

01:18:25.408 --> 01:18:28.571
After bilking trillions
from the American public

01:18:28.611 --> 01:18:30.238
by repossessing their homes,

01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:32.544
bankrupting them
when they got sick

01:18:32.582 --> 01:18:34.846
and convincing them
to invest their earnings

01:18:34.884 --> 01:18:38.183
and pensions in the casino
known as the stock market,

01:18:38.221 --> 01:18:41.622
the rich decided to make
one last heist

01:18:41.658 --> 01:18:45.025
and as their 30-year long
party came to an end,

01:18:45.061 --> 01:18:48.553
take as much of the silverware
with them as they could.

01:18:48.598 --> 01:18:51.431
But first they needed
a distraction.

01:18:51.467 --> 01:18:54.732
And as they learned
after 9/11,

01:18:54.771 --> 01:18:57.535
nothing works better
in the home of the brave

01:18:57.574 --> 01:19:00.566
than some good old
fashioned fear.

01:19:00.610 --> 01:19:04.444
And who better to wheel out
for one last scary performance

01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:07.415
than Chicken Little himself?

01:19:07.450 --> 01:19:10.942
Oscar voters,
for your consideration.

01:19:10.987 --> 01:19:12.648
Good evening.

01:19:12.689 --> 01:19:15.214
This is an extraordinary period
for America's economy.

01:19:15.258 --> 01:19:17.886
The government's
top economic experts

01:19:17.927 --> 01:19:20.191
warn that without immediate
action by Congress,

01:19:20.230 --> 01:19:23.222
America could slip into
a financial panic

01:19:23.266 --> 01:19:26.360
and a distressing scenario
would unfold.

01:19:26.402 --> 01:19:29.803
More banks could fail,
including some in your community.

01:19:29.839 --> 01:19:32.330
The stock market would drop even more,

01:19:32.375 --> 01:19:34.741
which would reduce the value
of your retirement account.

01:19:34.777 --> 01:19:37.439
The value of your home
could plummet.

01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:39.971
Foreclosures would
rise dramatically.

01:19:40.016 --> 01:19:42.246
And if you own
a business or a farm,

01:19:42.285 --> 01:19:44.913
you would find it harder
and more expensive to get credit.

01:19:44.954 --> 01:19:47.616
More businesses
would close their doors

01:19:47.657 --> 01:19:50.217
and millions of Americans
could lose their jobs.

01:19:50.260 --> 01:19:53.058
Even if you have good credit history,

01:19:53.096 --> 01:19:55.997
it would be more difficult for
you to get the loans you need

01:19:56.032 --> 01:19:58.330
to buy a car or send
your children to college.

01:19:58.368 --> 01:20:00.802
And ultimately our country
could experience

01:20:00.837 --> 01:20:03.601
a long and painful recession.

01:20:03.640 --> 01:20:07.770
Fellow citizens,
we must not let this happen.

01:20:07.810 --> 01:20:11.405
In reality there was no
need for this speech,

01:20:11.447 --> 01:20:13.540
because the mainstream media

01:20:13.583 --> 01:20:15.852
had already drunk
the Kool-Aid.

01:20:17.220 --> 01:20:19.518
Meltdown.
The American financial system

01:20:19.555 --> 01:20:21.113
is rocked to its foundation.

01:20:21.157 --> 01:20:23.489
The giant bank crumbles,
stocks plummet.

01:20:23.526 --> 01:20:26.893
- Nightmare on Wall Street.
- AIG fights for its life.

01:20:26.930 --> 01:20:28.864
- Blood on the floor.
- Armageddon.

01:20:28.898 --> 01:20:32.026
A category-5 test
of our financial levies.

01:20:32.068 --> 01:20:35.526
What the fuck happened?

01:20:35.571 --> 01:20:37.903
Have you ever seen
a dam fail?

01:20:37.941 --> 01:20:41.342
It starts with a little crack,
a little seepage.

01:20:41.377 --> 01:20:42.867
With overwhelming support,

01:20:42.912 --> 01:20:44.846
Congress struck down
the restrictions.

01:20:44.881 --> 01:20:46.815
Big banking is barreling back.

01:20:46.849 --> 01:20:48.874
And it starts eroding

01:20:48.918 --> 01:20:52.649
and it destroys all
the internal strength of the dam.

01:20:52.689 --> 01:20:54.350
Poison from the housing mess

01:20:54.390 --> 01:20:56.881
seeped deeper and deeper
into the banking system.

01:20:56.926 --> 01:20:59.019
And soon the dam works against itself.

01:20:59.062 --> 01:21:01.053
The weight of the dam
and the weight of the water

01:21:01.097 --> 01:21:02.462
conspire against it.

01:21:02.498 --> 01:21:04.227
Investors were dumping Bear shares

01:21:04.267 --> 01:21:05.757
leading a huge selloff...

01:21:05.802 --> 01:21:07.861
The stocks of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac

01:21:07.904 --> 01:21:09.701
were in freefall this morning...

01:21:09.739 --> 01:21:12.606
Then there's kind of a significant flow.

01:21:12.642 --> 01:21:16.078
Wall Street's losing streak
stretched into its 7th day.

01:21:16.112 --> 01:21:20.139
And then suddenly you've
got 60-70 foot sections.

01:21:20.183 --> 01:21:21.343
A dam exploding.

01:21:21.384 --> 01:21:23.113
Lehman Brothers, bankrupt.

01:21:23.152 --> 01:21:24.949
Merrill Lynch, sold in haste.

01:21:24.988 --> 01:21:26.922
- Now AIG.
- Just crashing.

01:21:26.956 --> 01:21:28.719
The market's year long slide

01:21:28.758 --> 01:21:31.386
has brought down
some of the biggest blue chips.

01:21:31.427 --> 01:21:33.224
The water starts rushing through.

01:21:33.262 --> 01:21:35.856
This morning,
Washington Mutual has gone under,

01:21:35.898 --> 01:21:38.366
the largest failure
in US banking history.

01:21:38.401 --> 01:21:40.198
Stocks fell off a cliff.

01:21:40.236 --> 01:21:43.228
The largest single point drop in history.

01:21:45.908 --> 01:21:49.366
It destroys the rest of the dam.

01:21:49.412 --> 01:21:51.209
And the whole failure

01:21:51.247 --> 01:21:53.738
looks like it only takes
2 minutes.

01:21:53.783 --> 01:21:57.116
But of course,
it's that little hole

01:21:57.153 --> 01:22:00.054
that's been there
for several years

01:22:00.089 --> 01:22:02.649
that really destroyed it.

01:22:02.692 --> 01:22:06.287
You have this fundamentally
unsound system

01:22:06.329 --> 01:22:09.492
built on
a foundation of sand

01:22:09.532 --> 01:22:11.659
instead of bedrock.

01:22:11.701 --> 01:22:14.033
And it was rotted
from the core.

01:22:15.571 --> 01:22:18.904
It seems like capitalism
is just collapsing on itself.

01:22:18.941 --> 01:22:20.670
Who got rich here?

01:22:20.710 --> 01:22:23.042
Lots of people got rich
during this time,

01:22:23.079 --> 01:22:27.675
primarily the officers
and directors

01:22:27.717 --> 01:22:30.311
of the large banks
and savings and loans

01:22:30.353 --> 01:22:32.844
and the specialty
non-prime lenders.

01:22:32.889 --> 01:22:36.325
These people became
unbelievably rich.

01:22:36.359 --> 01:22:39.658
And members of Congress got rich,

01:22:39.695 --> 01:22:41.492
especially once
they left Congress.

01:22:41.531 --> 01:22:44.659
A number of them go and work
in the financial institutions.

01:22:44.700 --> 01:22:47.294
Sure, and as do
Rubin and Summers.

01:22:47.336 --> 01:22:50.931
Robert Rubin, a one-time top executive

01:22:50.973 --> 01:22:54.033
at both Citigroup
and Goldman Sachs

01:22:54.077 --> 01:22:55.874
champion a change in the law

01:22:55.912 --> 01:22:58.346
that allowed commercial banks
to get into new areas

01:22:58.381 --> 01:23:02.147
like investment banking
and exotic insurance products.

01:23:03.953 --> 01:23:06.080
This made it legal
to let Citicorp

01:23:06.122 --> 01:23:07.885
merge with Travelers Group,

01:23:07.924 --> 01:23:10.950
a deal valued
at $70 billion,

01:23:10.993 --> 01:23:13.325
creating the world's
largest bank.

01:23:13.362 --> 01:23:16.229
After leaving
the Clinton administration,

01:23:16.265 --> 01:23:18.062
Rubin worked for Citigroup,

01:23:18.101 --> 01:23:22.663
earning more than
$115 million.

01:23:22.705 --> 01:23:24.696
Summers made
his money where?

01:23:24.740 --> 01:23:28.506
Summers made his money
as a supposed consultant

01:23:28.544 --> 01:23:31.536
and in giving speeches

01:23:31.581 --> 01:23:33.913
at apparently, in some cases,

01:23:33.950 --> 01:23:37.078
over $100,000 a pop.

01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:40.783
Summers also made $5.2 million
at his part-time job,

01:23:40.823 --> 01:23:44.054
advising a hedge fund.

01:23:44.093 --> 01:23:45.685
Where did Geithner work?

01:23:45.728 --> 01:23:48.561
Geithner has been a failure

01:23:48.598 --> 01:23:50.862
at pretty much everything
he's done in life.

01:23:50.900 --> 01:23:55.496
Most of the institutions
that destroyed the economy

01:23:55.538 --> 01:23:58.939
were under his direct
regulatory authority.

01:23:58.975 --> 01:24:01.273
How did he get the job
as Treasury Secretary?

01:24:01.310 --> 01:24:04.302
By completely
screwing up his job

01:24:04.347 --> 01:24:07.407
as President of the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York.

01:24:07.450 --> 01:24:09.179
That makes no sense.

01:24:09.218 --> 01:24:10.845
Of course, it makes
perfect sense.

01:24:10.887 --> 01:24:13.014
This is not
new to Washington.

01:24:13.055 --> 01:24:15.523
People who will give you
the wrong answer

01:24:15.558 --> 01:24:18.891
but the answer you want
are invaluable.

01:24:18.928 --> 01:24:21.260
And they often get promoted

01:24:21.297 --> 01:24:24.266
precisely because
they're willing to say

01:24:24.300 --> 01:24:26.768
and do absurd things.

01:24:26.802 --> 01:24:30.636
These are the people
that promised us

01:24:30.673 --> 01:24:34.632
that financial deregulation
would make all of us rich.

01:24:34.677 --> 01:24:38.147
And these are the people who
were personally made rich.

01:24:41.284 --> 01:24:45.380
It was not surprising that
the rich wanted to get richer.

01:24:45.421 --> 01:24:49.187
But now they had come up with
a new and brazen way to do it.

01:24:49.225 --> 01:24:53.127
Just back a big truck up
to the Department of Treasury

01:24:53.162 --> 01:24:56.654
and take $700 billion
of our tax money,

01:24:56.699 --> 01:24:58.690
no questions asked.

01:24:58.734 --> 01:25:02.500
I got Michael Moore here. You know who
Michael Moore is, don't you?

01:25:02.538 --> 01:25:05.405
The film director.
He's filming me right now.

01:25:05.441 --> 01:25:06.999
- I got my wife on the line.
- Hi.

01:25:07.043 --> 01:25:08.806
How are you doing?
Baron Hill from Indiana.

01:25:08.844 --> 01:25:10.311
How are you, sir?
Good state.

01:25:10.346 --> 01:25:12.177
- We're from Michigan you know?
- Yeah.

01:25:12.215 --> 01:25:13.807
How did this
collapse happen?

01:25:13.849 --> 01:25:18.081
I got home on a Friday, everything
was just fine in terms of the economy.

01:25:18.120 --> 01:25:20.850
I call back after my plane
landed in Indiana

01:25:20.890 --> 01:25:23.222
just to check in
with my office,

01:25:23.259 --> 01:25:25.090
and all of a sudden we've
got this crisis on our hands

01:25:25.127 --> 01:25:27.186
and that I'm gonna have to vote
when I come back Monday

01:25:27.230 --> 01:25:30.688
for a multibillion-dollar bailout
of the financial industry.

01:25:30.733 --> 01:25:34.669
The word that we got
was that if we did not act immediately

01:25:34.704 --> 01:25:39.505
the economy would collapse,
no doubt about it.

01:25:39.542 --> 01:25:42.875
I felt that
the announcement

01:25:42.912 --> 01:25:45.278
of this crisis in September,

01:25:45.314 --> 01:25:47.179
just a few weeks
before election,

01:25:47.216 --> 01:25:48.513
was very suspicious.

01:25:48.551 --> 01:25:51.577
This is when Congress
is the most nervous.

01:25:51.621 --> 01:25:53.987
And I thought, "Wait a minute.
What's going on here?

01:25:54.023 --> 01:25:56.457
This is not normal."

01:25:56.492 --> 01:25:58.357
The leadership of Congress

01:25:58.394 --> 01:25:59.986
and the Bush administration

01:26:00.029 --> 01:26:02.361
quickly held a series
of private meetings

01:26:02.398 --> 01:26:05.299
with the titans
of Wall Street to figure out

01:26:05.334 --> 01:26:07.666
just how much money
was needed to cover

01:26:07.703 --> 01:26:11.264
all the bad bets
investors had made.

01:26:11.307 --> 01:26:15.368
A deal was cut with Treasury
Secretary Henry Paulson,

01:26:15.411 --> 01:26:17.902
the former CEO
of Goldman Sachs,

01:26:17.947 --> 01:26:21.815
whose net worth was estimated
at $700 million

01:26:21.851 --> 01:26:25.685
when he left Goldman
to go and run the Treasury Department.

01:26:25.721 --> 01:26:29.521
I think we saw the best of
the United States of America

01:26:29.558 --> 01:26:32.959
in the Speaker's
office tonight.

01:26:32.995 --> 01:26:35.987
The best of America?

01:26:36.032 --> 01:26:39.934
Or did he mean
the best of Goldman Sachs?

01:26:39.969 --> 01:26:41.732
The Treasury Department,

01:26:41.771 --> 01:26:44.103
it's basically an arm
of Wall Street.

01:26:44.140 --> 01:26:47.200
All the people in charge
were from Goldman Sachs.

01:26:47.243 --> 01:26:50.371
We call it Government Goldman
in the modern era.

01:26:50.413 --> 01:26:52.574
That's because there were now numerous

01:26:52.615 --> 01:26:56.381
former Goldman executives
inside the Bush Treasury Department,

01:26:56.419 --> 01:26:58.683
as there were under Clinton.

01:26:58.721 --> 01:27:01.622
They worked as powerful
lobbyists from the inside

01:27:01.657 --> 01:27:03.955
to abolish
financial regulations

01:27:03.993 --> 01:27:06.461
while we paid
their salaries.

01:27:06.495 --> 01:27:08.759
Treasury Secretary Paulson--

01:27:08.798 --> 01:27:10.732
he wasn't just randomly
at Goldman.

01:27:10.766 --> 01:27:14.258
He was the guy at Goldman
who got them big time

01:27:14.303 --> 01:27:18.000
into buying these exotic
housing derivatives.

01:27:18.040 --> 01:27:21.498
So he got Goldman in
a huge amount of trouble.

01:27:21.544 --> 01:27:23.705
Insane housing derivatives

01:27:23.746 --> 01:27:26.738
had now destroyed much
of Goldman's competition.

01:27:26.782 --> 01:27:29.307
And with the Goldman boys
now calling the shots

01:27:29.352 --> 01:27:32.185
inside the government,
they would ensure that Goldman

01:27:32.221 --> 01:27:34.951
would end up as the kings
of Wall Street

01:27:34.990 --> 01:27:36.423
when the dust settled.

01:27:36.459 --> 01:27:38.188
So the last possible people

01:27:38.227 --> 01:27:41.025
that should be giving advice
to Treasury would be Goldman.

01:27:41.063 --> 01:27:42.587
So naturally Paulson,

01:27:42.631 --> 01:27:45.828
former CEO of Goldman,
puts them on.

01:27:45.868 --> 01:27:48.564
And what advice do they
end up giving?

01:27:48.604 --> 01:27:51.437
Well, to use the taxpayers

01:27:51.474 --> 01:27:53.908
to bail out Goldman

01:27:53.943 --> 01:27:56.810
and other favored financial
institutions.

01:27:56.846 --> 01:27:59.838
Well, Secretary Paulson
has submitted

01:27:59.882 --> 01:28:01.747
a simple proposal
to Congress.

01:28:01.784 --> 01:28:03.979
This is it--
3 pages.

01:28:04.019 --> 01:28:06.783
It's about
$1 billion a word.

01:28:06.822 --> 01:28:08.813
And it is quite simple.

01:28:08.858 --> 01:28:11.986
Secretary Paulson gets
the key to the treasury.

01:28:12.027 --> 01:28:15.292
He's gonna start off
by borrowing $700 billion

01:28:15.331 --> 01:28:16.821
in the name
of the American people,

01:28:16.866 --> 01:28:20.097
maybe more later.
And it waives all laws.

01:28:20.136 --> 01:28:22.366
All laws!

01:28:22.405 --> 01:28:25.841
Not even court review.
Pretty simple proposal.

01:28:25.875 --> 01:28:29.436
We are in a real
crisis situation

01:28:29.478 --> 01:28:31.469
that could mushroom

01:28:31.514 --> 01:28:33.880
into something worse
than the Great Depression.

01:28:33.916 --> 01:28:37.511
So I saw fear.
One gentleman started to cry.

01:28:37.553 --> 01:28:40.886
People are telling us
that it's going to be this gigantic calamity.

01:28:40.923 --> 01:28:42.788
And I'm up for election
in 2 months.

01:28:42.825 --> 01:28:44.588
8 weeks away
from election,

01:28:44.627 --> 01:28:47.255
I don't want to make a mistake.
What's the right thing to do?

01:28:47.296 --> 01:28:49.457
Heaven help us.

01:28:49.498 --> 01:28:51.489
If we fail to pass this

01:28:51.534 --> 01:28:54.298
I fear the worst
is yet to come.

01:28:54.336 --> 01:28:56.600
And a few members
were even told

01:28:56.639 --> 01:29:00.234
that there would be martial law
in America if we voted no.

01:29:00.276 --> 01:29:02.437
They were ramming this
thing down our throat.

01:29:02.478 --> 01:29:04.503
They wanted us to vote on it
right away

01:29:04.547 --> 01:29:07.209
without any kind of
thoughtful analysis.

01:29:07.249 --> 01:29:09.308
- No real hearings?
- No real hearings.

01:29:09.351 --> 01:29:11.410
And I wasn't about to--

01:29:11.454 --> 01:29:14.582
I got cornered into voting

01:29:14.623 --> 01:29:17.285
for the Iraq resolution
based upon some lies

01:29:17.326 --> 01:29:19.226
that they made to me and I wasn't going
to go through that again.

01:29:19.261 --> 01:29:22.560
I will not wait on events
while danger is gathering.

01:29:22.598 --> 01:29:26.090
I will not stand by as peril
draws closer and closer.

01:29:26.135 --> 01:29:28.968
Use fear and then you
get done what you want.

01:29:31.006 --> 01:29:33.600
And they created
in this window--

01:29:33.642 --> 01:29:36.372
2 months before election--
this pressure cooker.

01:29:36.412 --> 01:29:39.108
People understand that
the House of Representatives

01:29:39.148 --> 01:29:41.776
needs to pass this piece
of legislation.

01:29:41.817 --> 01:29:44.752
Mr. Speaker, my message
to the American people...

01:29:44.787 --> 01:29:47.779
don't let Congress
seal this Wall Street deal.

01:29:47.823 --> 01:29:50.383
These criminals have
so much political power

01:29:50.426 --> 01:29:52.860
they can shut down the normal
legislative process

01:29:52.895 --> 01:29:55.295
of the highest lawmaking
body in this land.

01:29:55.331 --> 01:29:57.265
All the committees
that should be scanning

01:29:57.299 --> 01:30:00.427
every word of what is being
negotiated are benched.

01:30:00.469 --> 01:30:03.199
And that means the American
people are benched too.

01:30:03.239 --> 01:30:05.469
We are constitutionally sworn

01:30:05.508 --> 01:30:07.635
to protect and defend
this republic

01:30:07.676 --> 01:30:10.907
against all enemies
foreign and domestic.

01:30:10.946 --> 01:30:13.744
They say it's gonna be
Y2K all over again.

01:30:13.782 --> 01:30:16.273
This is the same politics
of fear we are hearing

01:30:16.318 --> 01:30:18.809
from the fat-cat financial
bullies from Wall Street.

01:30:18.854 --> 01:30:21.414
Why aren't we asking Wall Street
to clean up its own mess?

01:30:21.457 --> 01:30:24.915
Why aren't we helping
American families faced with bankruptcy?

01:30:24.960 --> 01:30:28.054
Why aren't we reducing debts
from Main Street instead of Wall Street?

01:30:28.097 --> 01:30:29.928
Is this the United States Congress

01:30:29.965 --> 01:30:32.160
or the board of directors
of Goldman Sachs?

01:30:32.201 --> 01:30:34.965
The night before the vote

01:30:35.004 --> 01:30:37.871
the American people
in unprecedented numbers

01:30:37.907 --> 01:30:40.933
flooded Capitol Hill
with millions of messages

01:30:40.976 --> 01:30:43.672
demanding that
Congress vote no.

01:30:47.149 --> 01:30:50.050
The bailout package
was defeated today,

01:30:50.085 --> 01:30:52.315
voted down in the House
of Representatives.

01:30:52.354 --> 01:30:54.049
The stock market plunged--

01:30:54.089 --> 01:30:56.751
plunged to the single
greatest point loss

01:30:56.792 --> 01:30:59.090
in the Dow average
in one day ever.

01:30:59.128 --> 01:31:00.720
The question is this:

01:31:00.763 --> 01:31:03.129
is the failure of
the bailout reason enough

01:31:03.165 --> 01:31:06.362
to vote all the incumbents
out of office in 5 weeks?

01:31:06.402 --> 01:31:08.267
12 votes killed it.

01:31:08.304 --> 01:31:10.499
So did the voices of a lot
of the American people

01:31:10.539 --> 01:31:13.872
who called their representatives
and said no.

01:31:13.909 --> 01:31:16.275
Then Congress voted no.

01:31:16.312 --> 01:31:18.280
Tonight Congress
has left town.

01:31:18.314 --> 01:31:21.181
It was a rebuke that Congress
and Wall Street

01:31:21.216 --> 01:31:24.014
had rarely,
if ever, experienced.

01:31:24.053 --> 01:31:27.147
It was what the Citibank
memo had warned against:

01:31:27.189 --> 01:31:28.952
That if the peasants
ever chose

01:31:28.991 --> 01:31:31.118
to exercise their
democratic rights,

01:31:31.160 --> 01:31:34.152
the pillaging by the wealthy
would be over.

01:31:34.196 --> 01:31:38.326
So Paulson and company headed
back up to Capitol Hill.

01:31:38.367 --> 01:31:41.666
And faster than you can say
"Check, please,"

01:31:41.704 --> 01:31:45.470
they cut a backroom deal
with the help of the Democrats.

01:31:47.209 --> 01:31:48.699
This issue supersedes
an election.

01:31:48.744 --> 01:31:50.644
We need to get this right.
We need to do it quickly.

01:31:50.679 --> 01:31:52.112
I agree with the secretary.

01:31:52.147 --> 01:31:54.581
It's not gonna openly cost
all these hundreds of billions.

01:31:54.617 --> 01:31:56.585
We will recover most of it,
maybe all of it.

01:31:56.619 --> 01:31:59.713
The Democrats became

01:31:59.755 --> 01:32:03.282
the delivery man
for a bill

01:32:03.325 --> 01:32:05.657
for the Republican
president.

01:32:05.694 --> 01:32:09.186
The presidents and presidents-
to-be made phone calls

01:32:09.231 --> 01:32:12.359
and members-- I know
at least 2 members

01:32:12.401 --> 01:32:14.801
who have an interest
in the US Senate,

01:32:14.837 --> 01:32:16.031
and promises were made.

01:32:17.439 --> 01:32:19.634
Within days, the Congress

01:32:19.675 --> 01:32:21.666
did an amazing about-face

01:32:21.710 --> 01:32:25.771
and gave the banks the 700-plus
billion they wanted,

01:32:25.814 --> 01:32:27.679
the people be damned.

01:32:27.716 --> 01:32:30.651
On this vote
the yeas are 263,

01:32:30.686 --> 01:32:33.985
the nays are 171.
The motion is adopted.

01:32:34.023 --> 01:32:38.357
It was very carefully planned
to happen when it did,

01:32:38.394 --> 01:32:42.421
to involve the players
that it did.

01:32:42.464 --> 01:32:46.457
The message was carefully handled.

01:32:46.502 --> 01:32:48.527
They had Congress right where
they wanted them.

01:32:48.570 --> 01:32:51.698
You don't think it
was just happenstance?

01:32:51.740 --> 01:32:53.571
No.

01:32:53.609 --> 01:32:57.170
This was almost like
an intelligence operation

01:32:57.212 --> 01:33:00.579
that had to be coordinated
at the highest levels.

01:33:00.616 --> 01:33:03.176
This whole fiasco shows you

01:33:03.218 --> 01:33:07.917
that there are some forces--

01:33:07.956 --> 01:33:10.550
That are not democratic.

01:33:10.592 --> 01:33:12.457
Right. That are in control.

01:33:12.494 --> 01:33:15.258
Big time.

01:33:15.297 --> 01:33:18.357
They did a masterful job.
Very well executed.

01:33:21.070 --> 01:33:22.298
Do you think it's too harsh

01:33:22.337 --> 01:33:25.738
to call what has happened
here a coup d'état?

01:33:25.774 --> 01:33:27.332
A financial coup d'état?

01:33:27.376 --> 01:33:30.504
No, because I think
that's what's happened.

01:33:30.546 --> 01:33:33.811
- A financial coup d'état?
- Yeah.

01:33:35.584 --> 01:33:37.176
I could agree with that.

01:33:38.520 --> 01:33:40.613
I could agree with that
because the people here

01:33:40.656 --> 01:33:42.590
really aren't in charge.

01:33:42.624 --> 01:33:45.115
Wall Street is in charge.

01:33:46.895 --> 01:33:48.920
Where's our money?

01:33:48.964 --> 01:33:51.364
I don't know.

01:33:51.400 --> 01:33:53.732
Citigroup is spending $50 million

01:33:53.769 --> 01:33:55.396
on a luxury corporate jet.

01:33:55.437 --> 01:33:57.997
You don't know?
But you're the person--

01:33:58.040 --> 01:34:01.032
you're in charge of--
they put you in charge to find out.

01:34:01.076 --> 01:34:02.771
Goldman Sachs has set aside

01:34:02.811 --> 01:34:05.177
6.8 billion for bonuses.

01:34:05.214 --> 01:34:08.547
But Treasury followed
a don't-ask-don't-tell policy.

01:34:08.584 --> 01:34:10.814
They didn't ask the banks

01:34:10.853 --> 01:34:13.083
what they were going to do
with the money.

01:34:13.122 --> 01:34:16.717
And not having asked them,
the banks are not required to tell.

01:34:16.759 --> 01:34:19.421
AIG poolside meetings
at a Valley resort...

01:34:19.461 --> 01:34:20.655
Doesn't make any sense.

01:34:20.696 --> 01:34:23.392
We're getting word
that 73 people

01:34:23.432 --> 01:34:26.367
received at least
$1 million apiece.

01:34:26.401 --> 01:34:28.528
Why would the Department
of Treasury

01:34:28.570 --> 01:34:30.731
not require the banks
to tell them

01:34:30.773 --> 01:34:32.365
what they're doing
with our money?

01:34:32.407 --> 01:34:36.104
You're going to have
to ask Secretary Paulson that question.

01:34:36.145 --> 01:34:38.978
Because I've asked
that question

01:34:39.014 --> 01:34:42.245
in my role as head of the Congressional
Oversight Panel,

01:34:42.284 --> 01:34:44.377
and so far I haven't gotten an answer.
Maybe you'll get a better one.

01:34:46.655 --> 01:34:48.623
Good afternoon.
Hank Paulson's office.

01:34:48.657 --> 01:34:50.181
Yeah, this is Michael Moore.

01:34:50.225 --> 01:34:51.954
I'd like to talk
to Mr. Paulson.

01:34:51.994 --> 01:34:54.053
- I'm sorry. Your name again?
- Michael Moore.

01:34:54.096 --> 01:34:55.654
- Michael Moore?
- Yup.

01:34:56.197 --> 01:34:58.894
Hello? Hello?

01:34:58.934 --> 01:35:01.732
This is crazy what they're doing
with our money.

01:35:01.770 --> 01:35:04.534
If I could get them
to actually give the money back--

01:35:04.573 --> 01:35:06.308
I'd be in favor of that.

01:35:24.193 --> 01:35:26.627
We're here to get the money
back for the American people.

01:35:26.662 --> 01:35:28.493
I understand, sir,
but you can't come in.

01:35:28.530 --> 01:35:29.963
- Can you just take the bag?
- No.

01:35:29.998 --> 01:35:31.556
- Take it up there?
- Absolutely not.

01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:33.534
Fill it up.
I got more bags.

01:35:33.569 --> 01:35:35.366
10 billion probably
won't fit in here.

01:35:35.404 --> 01:35:36.564
You can't help me
get the money?

01:35:36.605 --> 01:35:37.765
I can't help you
get the money.

01:35:37.806 --> 01:35:40.001
What would happen if I made
a run for it right now?

01:35:42.144 --> 01:35:44.704
So I went to another bank.

01:35:45.914 --> 01:35:46.972
We want our money back.

01:35:47.015 --> 01:35:48.573
I went to all the banks.

01:35:48.617 --> 01:35:50.881
- You've seen this guy?
- Yeah.

01:35:50.919 --> 01:35:53.251
Okay, we're here to make
a citizen's arrest, actually.

01:35:53.288 --> 01:35:55.688
Just drop it
from the windows.

01:35:55.724 --> 01:35:58.284
And everywhere I went...

01:36:00.028 --> 01:36:01.325
I got the same reaction.

01:36:01.363 --> 01:36:03.524
We're actually here
to make a citizen's arrest

01:36:03.565 --> 01:36:05.055
of the entire board
of directors

01:36:05.100 --> 01:36:06.226
and the executives here.

01:36:06.268 --> 01:36:07.633
Why don't you speak
to my supervisor?

01:36:07.669 --> 01:36:09.500
- That's him right here.
- Where's he at?

01:36:09.538 --> 01:36:11.335
- In the white shirt? Blue tie?
- Yup.

01:36:11.373 --> 01:36:12.738
- That's him.
- Receding hairline?

01:36:12.774 --> 01:36:16.335
They're using the money
to buy other companies.

01:36:16.378 --> 01:36:19.040
This is our money.

01:36:19.081 --> 01:36:21.106
This is a police officer.

01:36:21.149 --> 01:36:23.276
I wanted to make a citizen's
arrest of the CEO.

01:36:23.318 --> 01:36:25.013
Mr. Blankfein.

01:36:25.554 --> 01:36:28.318
But you're here, so maybe
you could help me.

01:36:28.357 --> 01:36:31.815
- Let's do it outside.
- $170 billion of our taxpayer money.

01:36:31.860 --> 01:36:35.091
- You're not allowed in the building, sir.
- But I'm here to make an arrest.

01:36:35.130 --> 01:36:37.530
- I'm here to make an arrest.
- Make it outside, sir.

01:36:37.566 --> 01:36:38.999
I can't make it outside.
They're upstairs.

01:36:39.034 --> 01:36:40.934
I'll make an arrest, sir.

01:36:40.969 --> 01:36:42.630
You can arrest somebody?

01:36:42.671 --> 01:36:44.468
If you can arrest somebody,
I can arrest somebody.

01:36:44.506 --> 01:36:45.905
Sir, leave the building, sir.

01:36:45.941 --> 01:36:47.306
Who else do you want
to leave the building?

01:36:47.342 --> 01:36:49.139
Your cameraman and your crew.
Come on out, sir.

01:36:49.177 --> 01:36:52.044
They don't speak English.
Donde?

01:36:53.682 --> 01:36:56.344
These guys have broken
so many laws, you know?

01:36:56.385 --> 01:36:59.980
This is money.
It's theft, it's fraud.

01:37:09.498 --> 01:37:11.898
I'm gonna take it back
to the US Treasury

01:37:11.934 --> 01:37:13.731
right in this car.

01:37:13.769 --> 01:37:16.397
It's safe.
You can trust me.

01:37:19.841 --> 01:37:23.140
There's just these little hints

01:37:23.178 --> 01:37:27.615
that the unimaginable

01:37:27.649 --> 01:37:32.279
could occur, which is that...

01:37:34.723 --> 01:37:37.817
people in general

01:37:37.859 --> 01:37:40.487
in the United States
could actually

01:37:40.529 --> 01:37:43.930
become angry

01:37:43.966 --> 01:37:45.866
at the wealthy.

01:37:45.901 --> 01:37:49.393
Shame on you!
Shame on you!

01:37:49.438 --> 01:37:51.599
People who became rich in this country

01:37:51.640 --> 01:37:55.736
in the last decades
were not even making

01:37:55.777 --> 01:37:59.611
the things
that everybody loved.

01:37:59.648 --> 01:38:03.049
They were playing games

01:38:03.085 --> 01:38:05.485
that ended up actually
harming everybody.

01:38:09.291 --> 01:38:13.785
So some kind of disease
has entered into the economy.

01:38:15.397 --> 01:38:19.060
It was unusual for Americans
to turn against the rich

01:38:19.101 --> 01:38:22.332
because of the carrot that had
always been held out in front of us,

01:38:22.371 --> 01:38:25.568
that we too could be
one of them someday.

01:38:25.607 --> 01:38:28.371
People were starting not to believe that.

01:38:28.410 --> 01:38:31.106
And that frightened the rich.

01:38:31.146 --> 01:38:35.242
Because off in the distance
they heard something coming

01:38:35.283 --> 01:38:37.945
and it wasn't another dry martini.

01:38:37.986 --> 01:38:40.750
It was the friggin' people.

01:38:42.657 --> 01:38:45.023
We are ready to take this country

01:38:45.060 --> 01:38:47.221
in a fundamentally new direction.

01:38:47.262 --> 01:38:49.856
That's what's happening
in America right now.

01:38:49.898 --> 01:38:53.561
Change is what's happening
in America.

01:38:53.602 --> 01:38:55.263
Holy shit.

01:38:55.303 --> 01:38:58.295
This was not
what Wall Street wanted.

01:38:58.340 --> 01:39:00.831
What if he won?

01:39:00.876 --> 01:39:03.709
What would happen
to their way of life?

01:39:05.547 --> 01:39:07.981
So they did what they always do.

01:39:08.016 --> 01:39:10.177
They threw as much money
at him as they could.

01:39:11.887 --> 01:39:15.323
Goldman Sachs became his
number-one private contributor

01:39:15.357 --> 01:39:18.190
with nearly $1 million in contributions.

01:39:20.028 --> 01:39:23.623
But yet they still weren't sure
what he would do.

01:39:23.665 --> 01:39:26.566
How did he really feel about them

01:39:26.601 --> 01:39:29.071
and their way of life?

01:39:29.071 --> 01:39:32.973
My attitude is that if the economy
is good for folks from the bottom up,

01:39:33.008 --> 01:39:34.168
it's gonna be good for everybody.

01:39:37.279 --> 01:39:39.372
Senator Obama is running
to spread the wealth.

01:39:39.414 --> 01:39:41.848
Joe the Plumber said to him

01:39:41.883 --> 01:39:44.477
that plan sounded like socialism.

01:39:48.090 --> 01:39:49.614
I love America.

01:39:49.658 --> 01:39:53.458
I want to make sure it stays a democracy
and not a socialist society.

01:39:56.798 --> 01:40:00.199
I really think he's gonna bring socialism
if he gets half a chance.

01:40:00.235 --> 01:40:02.965
I don't trust Obama at all.

01:40:04.573 --> 01:40:06.541
I left Europe 4 decades ago

01:40:06.575 --> 01:40:08.839
because socialism has killed
opportunities there.

01:40:08.877 --> 01:40:12.574
"Someone is going to have to
give up a piece of their pie

01:40:12.614 --> 01:40:14.844
so someone else can have more."

01:40:14.883 --> 01:40:16.214
I want all my pie.

01:40:17.686 --> 01:40:20.587
Barack Obama is a socialist,
it's that simple.

01:40:24.426 --> 01:40:27.259
The scare campaign wasn't working.

01:40:27.295 --> 01:40:30.924
In fact, the more they called
Obama a socialist,

01:40:30.966 --> 01:40:34.026
the more he went ahead in the polls.

01:40:34.069 --> 01:40:36.765
And by using the word so much,

01:40:36.805 --> 01:40:41.071
it made a new generation curious
about what that was.

01:40:41.109 --> 01:40:43.737
For instance, few of them knew

01:40:43.778 --> 01:40:46.474
there was actually a socialist
in the United States Senate.

01:40:46.515 --> 01:40:49.746
Of course he was from
the gay state of Vermont.

01:40:51.186 --> 01:40:52.881
You say that you're a socialist.
Tell me what that means.

01:40:52.921 --> 01:40:54.786
I'm a democratic socialist,

01:40:54.823 --> 01:40:57.553
which means that the function
of government is to represent

01:40:57.592 --> 01:40:59.025
middle income and working people

01:40:59.060 --> 01:41:01.426
rather than just the wealthy
and the powerful.

01:41:01.463 --> 01:41:03.328
One of the things that we've done here,

01:41:03.365 --> 01:41:06.163
we've become very religious
in worshipping greed.

01:41:06.201 --> 01:41:08.533
We put on the front pages
of the magazines

01:41:08.570 --> 01:41:10.162
guys who have made
billions of dollars.

01:41:10.205 --> 01:41:12.833
We ignore the cops, the firemen,
the teachers, the nurses

01:41:12.874 --> 01:41:16.071
who every day are doing so much
in improving the lives of people.

01:41:16.111 --> 01:41:17.510
We've got to change our value system.

01:41:18.146 --> 01:41:20.310
That doesn't sound too bad.

01:41:20.348 --> 01:41:24.409
I mean, it sounds like something
maybe we should try.

01:41:24.452 --> 01:41:26.147
Within a few months,

01:41:26.188 --> 01:41:28.247
the Rasmussen poll reported

01:41:28.290 --> 01:41:30.884
that only 37% of young adults

01:41:30.926 --> 01:41:33.724
now favor capitalism over socialism.

01:41:33.762 --> 01:41:37.095
I hope the economy will...

01:41:39.401 --> 01:41:42.302
At 11:00 we project Barack Obama

01:41:42.337 --> 01:41:44.965
President-Elect
of the United States of America.

01:42:18.673 --> 01:42:21.107
Just 2 years earlier

01:42:21.142 --> 01:42:23.337
had anyone predicted
this moment,

01:42:23.378 --> 01:42:25.938
they would have been
considered crazy.

01:42:27.215 --> 01:42:29.308
But that's how fast
things change.

01:42:31.987 --> 01:42:34.478
It was in an instant

01:42:34.522 --> 01:42:38.151
a farewell to the old America.

01:42:41.162 --> 01:42:44.791
The country
was electrified by his victory.

01:42:44.833 --> 01:42:47.666
And suddenly people
were inspired

01:42:47.702 --> 01:42:50.572
to do things they never
would have done before.

01:42:51.473 --> 01:42:53.202
Like the sheriff in Detroit

01:42:53.241 --> 01:42:56.039
who decided it was time
to break the law

01:42:56.077 --> 01:42:58.170
in order to help the people.

01:42:58.213 --> 01:43:00.238
Doesn't it seem kind of strange to you

01:43:00.282 --> 01:43:03.547
they would seek a government bailout?
I thought that's not what they do.

01:43:03.585 --> 01:43:06.679
1-0-1 radio.

01:43:06.721 --> 01:43:10.282
I thought the free market
is you sink or swim.

01:43:10.325 --> 01:43:13.726
I just saw them sink
and cry like babies

01:43:13.762 --> 01:43:16.322
for assistance from everybody else.

01:43:17.499 --> 01:43:21.629
Today I will be stopping
all mortgage foreclosure sales

01:43:21.670 --> 01:43:23.331
in Wayne County.

01:43:23.371 --> 01:43:27.000
I cannot in clear conscience
allow anymore families

01:43:27.042 --> 01:43:29.567
to lose their homes
through foreclosure sales.

01:43:29.611 --> 01:43:32.375
What must the banks have thought

01:43:32.414 --> 01:43:35.474
seeing the law that was set up
to protect their interests

01:43:35.517 --> 01:43:37.246
being subverted?

01:43:37.285 --> 01:43:40.277
Do you think the free market
has failed Detroit?

01:43:40.322 --> 01:43:43.553
Well, I mean, I think that the free market
failed the country.

01:43:43.591 --> 01:43:45.860
You know, this is crazy.

01:43:45.860 --> 01:43:47.828
Neighborhoods that are
completely destroyed

01:43:47.862 --> 01:43:50.194
because too many homes
have been foreclosed.

01:43:50.231 --> 01:43:53.291
And then you wonder,
is this really America

01:43:53.335 --> 01:43:55.394
or is this a third-world country?

01:43:55.437 --> 01:43:56.927
Exactly what are we doing here?

01:43:56.971 --> 01:44:01.101
Until things get so bad that people
can do nothing but protest,

01:44:01.142 --> 01:44:03.110
and then those
are called revolutions.

01:44:03.144 --> 01:44:07.137
And sometimes revolutions begin

01:44:07.182 --> 01:44:08.410
in unlikely places.

01:44:08.450 --> 01:44:10.315
Wake up.

01:44:10.352 --> 01:44:12.013
Living in the back of a truck

01:44:12.053 --> 01:44:16.251
after a bank foreclosed on
the home they had owned for 22 years,

01:44:16.291 --> 01:44:19.692
the Trody family of Miami,
with the help of their neighbors,

01:44:19.728 --> 01:44:22.162
took matters into their own hands.

01:44:22.197 --> 01:44:25.189
On behalf of this family
and this community,

01:44:25.233 --> 01:44:28.669
we liberate this home for this family.

01:44:28.703 --> 01:44:30.603
Cut the sign down.
Take it off.

01:44:31.238 --> 01:44:32.902
Yay!

01:44:32.941 --> 01:44:35.671
When I say community,
y'all say power.

01:44:35.710 --> 01:44:38.757
- Community!
- Power!

01:44:39.481 --> 01:44:42.555
- Community!
- Power!

01:44:42.884 --> 01:44:45.250
It wasn't long before
the guy from the bank

01:44:45.286 --> 01:44:47.481
who had evicted them came back.

01:44:47.522 --> 01:44:49.251
See this?

01:44:49.290 --> 01:44:50.951
I want you to go ahead
and take a picture of that.

01:44:50.992 --> 01:44:53.392
You're trespassing.

01:44:53.428 --> 01:44:55.953
We did an eviction here and the people
went back inside the property.

01:44:55.997 --> 01:44:58.659
Yes.
So I need police assistance.

01:44:58.700 --> 01:45:00.258
When all these houses are empty

01:45:00.301 --> 01:45:02.701
the value of everybody
else's house goes down.

01:45:02.737 --> 01:45:05.831
So if you can keep
these people in this house

01:45:05.874 --> 01:45:08.104
that will help not only them...

01:45:08.143 --> 01:45:11.112
So you see, the situation is that
the people--

01:45:11.146 --> 01:45:13.137
if the bank lets them go back inside,

01:45:13.181 --> 01:45:16.673
then the bank misses the opportunity
to sell the house to somebody else.

01:45:16.718 --> 01:45:19.346
The banks are selling
so many houses right now.

01:45:19.387 --> 01:45:22.879
Well, if the bank lets everybody
get back inside the house for free--

01:45:22.924 --> 01:45:24.858
Then people will have places to live.

01:45:24.893 --> 01:45:27.623
People fighting back
was an unusual sight.

01:45:27.662 --> 01:45:30.688
So 9 police cars
responded to the call.

01:45:30.732 --> 01:45:32.723
Considering the neighborhood,

01:45:32.767 --> 01:45:34.997
the response time
was impressive.

01:45:35.036 --> 01:45:36.936
- You are not in charge.
- I'm not saying I'm in charge.

01:45:36.971 --> 01:45:39.462
I'm saying she doesn't want to be isolated.
You don't have to answer any questions.

01:45:39.507 --> 01:45:41.702
You don't have to say
anything to them, okay?

01:45:41.743 --> 01:45:43.643
But the Trodys stood their ground.

01:45:43.678 --> 01:45:46.272
We don't have nowhere else to go.

01:45:46.314 --> 01:45:49.215
- This was the backup plan.
- We're forced to live inside of a truck.

01:45:49.250 --> 01:45:52.219
This was our plan B.
We don't have no plan C.

01:45:52.253 --> 01:45:54.721
That is our grandma and it's not right.

01:45:54.756 --> 01:45:57.247
She's been in this house for 22 years
and y'all gonna put her out?

01:45:57.292 --> 01:45:59.283
How do you feel putting people
out of their homes

01:45:59.327 --> 01:46:01.454
every single frickin' day?

01:46:01.496 --> 01:46:03.896
You should rather be home
instead of do something like that.

01:46:03.932 --> 01:46:07.265
Where is the money the federal
government put in the bank?

01:46:07.302 --> 01:46:11.261
We should be telling you that you're
trespassing because this is our house.

01:46:17.612 --> 01:46:20.911
<i>* Rooted like a tree,
rooted like a tree</i>

01:46:20.949 --> 01:46:23.440
<i>* We are here</i>

01:46:23.485 --> 01:46:26.454
<i>* Stand up strong...</i>

01:46:26.488 --> 01:46:29.048
Let's go.

01:46:29.090 --> 01:46:31.115
- We did good. We did good.
- All right.

01:46:31.159 --> 01:46:34.458
The police and the man
from the bank were sent packing.

01:46:34.496 --> 01:46:36.691
Ain't no power
like the power of the people.

01:46:36.731 --> 01:46:38.995
And the power of the people don't stop.
Say what?

01:46:39.033 --> 01:46:41.661
Ain't no power
like the power of the people.

01:46:41.703 --> 01:46:44.263
And the power of the people don't stop.
Say what?

01:46:44.305 --> 01:46:46.967
Don't leave your home.

01:46:47.008 --> 01:46:48.373
Because you know what?

01:46:48.409 --> 01:46:50.673
When those companies say
they have your mortgage,

01:46:50.712 --> 01:46:53.647
unless you have a lawyer
that can put his finger

01:46:53.681 --> 01:46:56.172
or her finger on that mortgage,
you don't have that mortgage.

01:46:56.217 --> 01:47:00.176
And you're gonna find that they can't find
the paper up there on Wall Street.

01:47:00.221 --> 01:47:04.214
So I say to the American people,
you be squatters in your own homes.

01:47:04.259 --> 01:47:06.784
Don't you leave
in Ohio and Michigan,

01:47:06.828 --> 01:47:08.989
in Indiana and Illinois
and all these other places

01:47:09.030 --> 01:47:11.123
where our people are being
treated like chattel.

01:47:11.165 --> 01:47:14.328
And this Congress is stymied.

01:47:15.703 --> 01:47:18.501
It's not every day you get
to see a member of Congress

01:47:18.540 --> 01:47:21.276
encouraging open rebellion.

01:47:21.276 --> 01:47:23.506
Back in Chicago,

01:47:23.545 --> 01:47:25.911
the workers at Republic
Windows & Doors

01:47:25.947 --> 01:47:27.209
had a bright idea.

01:47:28.850 --> 01:47:31.182
They decided that on
second thought,

01:47:31.219 --> 01:47:34.416
it wasn't okay to be fired
without notice,

01:47:34.455 --> 01:47:37.549
to be denied their vacation
and severance pay

01:47:37.592 --> 01:47:40.618
and to have their
medical benefits cut off.

01:47:42.730 --> 01:47:45.426
So they came up with a plan.

01:47:45.466 --> 01:47:48.401
Tell Bank of America
and the owners of the company

01:47:48.436 --> 01:47:50.927
that it was a new day in America.

01:47:50.972 --> 01:47:52.906
They weren't going
to leave the building

01:47:52.941 --> 01:47:56.240
until they were paid
what they were owed.

01:47:56.277 --> 01:48:00.236
Yes, it was a good old fashioned
sit-down strike.

01:48:03.017 --> 01:48:05.315
We understand that perhaps

01:48:05.353 --> 01:48:08.618
some bad business deals
were made.

01:48:08.656 --> 01:48:11.887
But guess what?
We don't make business deals.

01:48:11.926 --> 01:48:14.190
We make windows and doors.

01:48:14.228 --> 01:48:16.162
Why should we be punished?

01:48:28.710 --> 01:48:31.042
The union organizers
and the workers

01:48:31.079 --> 01:48:34.776
prepared for a police assault
that was sure to come.

01:48:34.816 --> 01:48:37.444
I'm gonna take the chance.

01:48:37.485 --> 01:48:39.385
You're prepared to be arrested?

01:48:39.420 --> 01:48:41.650
I am prepared to be arrested
if it's necessary.

01:48:41.689 --> 01:48:45.648
We've been here since yesterday
and we aren't going anywhere.

01:48:45.693 --> 01:48:47.524
We are committed to this.

01:48:47.562 --> 01:48:49.894
It wasn't long before the media showed up.

01:48:49.931 --> 01:48:52.832
And given the mood of the country
toward the bailout,

01:48:52.867 --> 01:48:56.826
even the TV anchors had run out
of sympathy for the banks.

01:48:56.871 --> 01:49:00.602
In Chicago, a group of factory workers
watched like the rest of us

01:49:00.642 --> 01:49:03.270
as taxpayers bailed out
the financial industry.

01:49:03.311 --> 01:49:06.576
Now these laid-off workers
are demanding Bank of America

01:49:06.614 --> 01:49:09.310
spend some of its
bailout money on them.

01:49:09.350 --> 01:49:11.443
It says "Bank Robbers of America."

01:49:11.486 --> 01:49:14.649
Look, if we the taxpayers
are going to provide

01:49:14.689 --> 01:49:17.681
a bailout for companies
like Bank of America,

01:49:17.725 --> 01:49:20.592
then the least they can do
is use those funds

01:49:20.628 --> 01:49:23.119
on American workers
and companies.

01:49:23.164 --> 01:49:26.292
$25 billion to Bank of America.

01:49:26.334 --> 01:49:28.700
How do people sleep at night
when they act like that?

01:49:28.736 --> 01:49:30.328
I don't get it.

01:49:30.371 --> 01:49:32.271
Because what's the point
of bailing them out

01:49:32.306 --> 01:49:34.968
if there aren't any jobs?

01:49:35.009 --> 01:49:37.534
The strike went on day after day.

01:49:37.578 --> 01:49:40.342
The police had not yet come.

01:49:40.381 --> 01:49:43.179
But the son of a Chicago
steelworker did.

01:49:43.217 --> 01:49:47.381
He just also happened to be
the bishop in Chicago.

01:49:47.422 --> 01:49:49.413
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:49:49.457 --> 01:49:51.652
I am Bishop James Wilkowski.

01:49:51.693 --> 01:49:54.890
I know that you are all undergoing

01:49:54.929 --> 01:49:56.954
a great trial.

01:49:56.998 --> 01:49:59.728
You are teaching

01:49:59.767 --> 01:50:02.133
to our young people

01:50:02.170 --> 01:50:04.195
that it is just

01:50:04.238 --> 01:50:07.799
to challenge
that which is unfair.

01:50:08.843 --> 01:50:12.939
I grew up on the far southeast
side of Chicago

01:50:12.980 --> 01:50:14.709
and I saw what happened

01:50:14.749 --> 01:50:18.082
when all the steel mills
disappeared.

01:50:18.119 --> 01:50:20.986
And I saw the impact that it had

01:50:21.022 --> 01:50:22.785
on families.

01:50:22.824 --> 01:50:24.724
But this time

01:50:24.759 --> 01:50:26.818
we are with you.

01:50:26.861 --> 01:50:29.796
And we will not abandon you.

01:50:29.831 --> 01:50:31.822
In the name of the Father
and the Son

01:50:31.866 --> 01:50:33.493
and the Holy Spirit.
Amen.

01:50:33.534 --> 01:50:35.102
The body of Christ.

01:50:37.805 --> 01:50:39.332
The body of Christ.

01:50:41.976 --> 01:50:43.500
The body of Christ.

01:50:45.847 --> 01:50:48.645
When it comes to the situation

01:50:48.683 --> 01:50:52.084
here in Chicago
with the workers

01:50:52.120 --> 01:50:55.988
who are asking for the benefits
and payments

01:50:56.023 --> 01:50:58.719
that they have earned,
I think they're absolutely right.

01:51:02.330 --> 01:51:05.595
What's happening to them
is reflective of what's happening

01:51:05.633 --> 01:51:07.601
across this economy.

01:51:07.635 --> 01:51:10.263
He said, "What's happening to them
is reflective of what's happening..."

01:51:10.304 --> 01:51:12.238
He said what is happening to those workers

01:51:12.273 --> 01:51:14.867
is reflective to what's happening
across this economy.

01:51:14.909 --> 01:51:17.776
I was watching Obama's press
conference this morning.

01:51:17.812 --> 01:51:20.110
I just got out of bed and decided

01:51:20.148 --> 01:51:22.878
the best thing I could do
was to feed people.

01:51:22.917 --> 01:51:24.407
So I brought some food.

01:51:24.452 --> 01:51:26.750
- I brought some sandwiches.
- Good.

01:51:26.788 --> 01:51:30.588
In fact, lots of Chicagoans
showed up to support the workers.

01:51:30.625 --> 01:51:32.183
The workers have become
a national symbol

01:51:32.226 --> 01:51:34.251
for thousands of employees
laid off across the country.

01:51:34.295 --> 01:51:36.525
The sit-in has grabbed
the attention of politicians

01:51:36.564 --> 01:51:40.193
who believe it exemplifies an imbalance
between a Wall Street

01:51:40.234 --> 01:51:44.034
that gets government help
and a Main Street that gets the shaft.

01:51:44.071 --> 01:51:46.062
The question started to be asked:

01:51:46.107 --> 01:51:48.575
Was this is the beginnings of a worker's
revolt against Wall Street?

01:51:51.179 --> 01:51:53.306
The people united.

01:51:53.347 --> 01:51:55.406
We'll never be defeated.

01:51:55.449 --> 01:51:59.283
Bail out workers, not the banks.
Bail out workers, not the banks.

01:51:59.320 --> 01:52:03.654
Pledges of financial support and
food showed up by the truckload.

01:52:03.691 --> 01:52:07.058
It's really beyond what we had
at first initially imagined.

01:52:07.094 --> 01:52:09.892
And so now we're dreaming a little bit.

01:52:09.931 --> 01:52:12.923
We even had a conversation--
well, what if we just tried

01:52:12.967 --> 01:52:14.696
to run the factory like a cooperative?

01:52:14.735 --> 01:52:16.760
We don't have any money.
We're not capitalists.

01:52:16.804 --> 01:52:19.898
We're having those kind
of conversations

01:52:19.941 --> 01:52:22.671
and the workers are thinking about it
and it's a difficult thing

01:52:22.710 --> 01:52:24.974
'cause, you know, if you've been
told your whole life

01:52:25.012 --> 01:52:28.311
that things are the way
other people tell you they are,

01:52:28.349 --> 01:52:30.340
to be able to think
I can make it different

01:52:30.384 --> 01:52:33.478
is quite a big deal.

01:52:35.690 --> 01:52:38.352
We're all over the national news.
Everyone is watching you

01:52:38.392 --> 01:52:41.725
because they're so inspired by you.

01:52:44.398 --> 01:52:46.229
After 6 days of the sit-in

01:52:46.267 --> 01:52:49.498
Bank of America decided
enough was enough.

01:52:49.537 --> 01:52:51.732
Better to pay off
these workers now

01:52:51.772 --> 01:52:55.139
and hope their little
revolution goes away.

01:52:55.176 --> 01:52:58.907
And so the bank and the company
agreed to all the worker's demands.

01:52:58.946 --> 01:53:01.847
Yes we did!
Yes we did!

01:53:01.883 --> 01:53:05.546
The average package for each worker

01:53:05.586 --> 01:53:09.454
will be very close to $6,000.

01:53:09.490 --> 01:53:12.721
But this is about more
than just money.

01:53:12.760 --> 01:53:16.218
It's about what can be achieved

01:53:16.264 --> 01:53:20.257
when workers organize
and stand up for justice.

01:53:20.301 --> 01:53:22.360
Just to fight--
fight fight fight fight fight

01:53:22.403 --> 01:53:24.769
just to get the most basic thing

01:53:24.805 --> 01:53:26.568
that people should take for granted

01:53:26.607 --> 01:53:30.407
and that's legally theirs.

01:53:30.444 --> 01:53:34.448
We just fight so hard just for
the most basic things in life.

01:53:36.751 --> 01:53:39.879
It's a fight we knew
all too well in Flint, Michigan.

01:53:39.921 --> 01:53:43.288
For it was here that my uncle
and his fellow workers

01:53:43.324 --> 01:53:46.054
first brought down the mighty
corporate interests

01:53:46.093 --> 01:53:47.754
that dominated their lives.

01:53:49.997 --> 01:53:53.398
It was the day before
New Year's Eve in 1936.

01:53:53.434 --> 01:53:56.870
Hundreds of men and women
took over the GM factories in Flint

01:53:56.904 --> 01:53:59.236
and occupied them for 44 days.

01:54:01.108 --> 01:54:04.475
They were the first union that beat
an industrial corporation.

01:54:04.512 --> 01:54:06.810
And their actions eventually resulted

01:54:06.847 --> 01:54:09.315
in the creation of a middle class.

01:54:09.350 --> 01:54:12.478
But back in these days of the Flint
sit-down strike,

01:54:12.520 --> 01:54:16.854
the police and the company thugs
were not going to just stand by.

01:54:16.891 --> 01:54:20.486
After a bloody battle one evening,
the Governor of Michigan,

01:54:20.528 --> 01:54:23.691
with the support of the President
of the United States

01:54:23.731 --> 01:54:27.531
Franklin Roosevelt,
sent in the National Guard.

01:54:27.568 --> 01:54:31.595
But the guns of the soldiers
weren't used on the workers.

01:54:31.639 --> 01:54:33.300
They were pointed at the police

01:54:33.341 --> 01:54:35.309
and the hired goons,

01:54:35.343 --> 01:54:38.870
warning them to leave
these workers alone.

01:54:40.014 --> 01:54:42.847
For Mr. Roosevelt believed
that the men inside

01:54:42.883 --> 01:54:47.047
had a right to a redress
of their grievances.

01:54:48.389 --> 01:54:51.620
7 years later,
President Roosevelt was too sick

01:54:51.659 --> 01:54:55.493
to go up to the Capitol and give his
annual State of the Union Address.

01:54:55.529 --> 01:54:57.360
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:54:57.398 --> 01:55:00.265
the President of the United States.

01:55:00.301 --> 01:55:04.829
It has been my custom to deliver
these annual messages in person.

01:55:04.872 --> 01:55:07.898
So he gave it from
the White House over the radio.

01:55:07.942 --> 01:55:11.002
When it was over he asked
the newsreel cameras

01:55:11.045 --> 01:55:14.105
to step into his room because he
wanted the American people

01:55:14.148 --> 01:55:17.777
to see one particular part
of his speech.

01:55:17.818 --> 01:55:21.447
The President of the United States
then took the radical step

01:55:21.489 --> 01:55:24.185
of proposing a second Bill of Rights

01:55:24.225 --> 01:55:25.624
to the Constitution.

01:55:25.659 --> 01:55:29.288
In our day certain economic truths

01:55:29.330 --> 01:55:32.527
have become accepted
as self-evident.

01:55:32.566 --> 01:55:35.126
A second Bill of Rights

01:55:35.169 --> 01:55:38.935
under which a new basis of security
and prosperity

01:55:38.973 --> 01:55:41.237
can be established for all

01:55:41.275 --> 01:55:44.972
regardless of station
or race or creed.

01:55:45.012 --> 01:55:47.810
Among these are:

01:55:47.848 --> 01:55:51.807
The right to a useful
and remunerative job;

01:55:51.852 --> 01:55:55.310
The right to earn enough to provide
adequate food

01:55:55.356 --> 01:55:56.914
and clothing and recreation;

01:55:56.957 --> 01:55:59.482
The right of every farmer

01:55:59.527 --> 01:56:01.961
to raise and sell his products

01:56:01.996 --> 01:56:05.124
at a return which will
give him and his family

01:56:05.166 --> 01:56:07.532
a decent living;

01:56:07.568 --> 01:56:11.504
The right of every businessman
large and small

01:56:11.539 --> 01:56:14.906
to trade in an atmosphere of freedom,

01:56:14.942 --> 01:56:18.639
freedom from unfair competition
and domination

01:56:18.679 --> 01:56:21.807
by monopolies at home or abroad;

01:56:21.849 --> 01:56:25.307
The right of every family
to a decent home;

01:56:25.352 --> 01:56:28.981
The right to adequate medical care

01:56:29.023 --> 01:56:32.925
and the opportunity to achieve
and enjoy good health;

01:56:32.960 --> 01:56:36.293
The right to adequate protection

01:56:36.330 --> 01:56:39.731
from the economic fears
of old age,

01:56:39.767 --> 01:56:42.258
sickness, accidents

01:56:42.303 --> 01:56:44.134
and unemployment;

01:56:44.171 --> 01:56:47.231
The right to a good education.

01:56:47.274 --> 01:56:51.677
All of these rights spell security.

01:56:51.712 --> 01:56:54.738
And after this war is won,

01:56:54.782 --> 01:56:58.149
we must be prepared
to move forward

01:56:58.185 --> 01:57:01.279
in the implementation
of these rights

01:57:01.322 --> 01:57:05.088
to new goals of human happiness
and wellbeing.

01:57:05.126 --> 01:57:09.620
For unless there is security
here at home,

01:57:09.663 --> 01:57:14.498
there cannot be lasting peace
in the world.

01:57:23.944 --> 01:57:27.243
Roosevelt would be dead
in little over a year.

01:57:30.050 --> 01:57:33.383
He would not live to see
the end of the war.

01:57:33.420 --> 01:57:37.254
Nor would there be any enactment
of his new Bill of Rights.

01:57:44.732 --> 01:57:47.724
Had he lived and succeeded,

01:57:47.768 --> 01:57:50.100
every American,
regardless of race,

01:57:50.137 --> 01:57:53.265
would have had a right
to a decent job...

01:57:56.210 --> 01:57:57.802
a livable wage...

01:58:00.381 --> 01:58:01.780
universal health care...

01:58:03.817 --> 01:58:05.546
a good education...

01:58:07.988 --> 01:58:10.149
an affordable home...

01:58:12.293 --> 01:58:14.557
a paid vacation...

01:58:18.365 --> 01:58:20.993
and an adequate pension.

01:58:23.837 --> 01:58:26.431
None of this would come to pass.

01:58:28.509 --> 01:58:32.843
No American would be
guaranteed any of this.

01:58:36.450 --> 01:58:39.078
But the people of Europe and Japan

01:58:39.119 --> 01:58:41.815
got every one of these rights.

01:58:41.855 --> 01:58:44.517
How did that happen?

01:58:44.558 --> 01:58:49.291
After the war, the people
of Roosevelt's administration

01:58:49.330 --> 01:58:52.299
went overseas
to help rebuild Europe.

01:58:52.333 --> 01:58:56.326
During this time new constitutions
were written

01:58:56.370 --> 01:59:00.830
for the defeated nations
of Germany, Italy and Japan.

01:59:00.874 --> 01:59:03.570
The Italian constitution

01:59:03.611 --> 01:59:06.580
guaranteed all women equal rights.

01:59:06.614 --> 01:59:09.412
And this was 1947.

01:59:09.450 --> 01:59:13.614
The German constitution
said that the state has the right

01:59:13.654 --> 01:59:17.090
to take over property
and the means of production

01:59:17.124 --> 01:59:19.024
for the common good.

01:59:19.059 --> 01:59:22.119
And here's what we wrote up
for the Japanese.

01:59:22.162 --> 01:59:25.563
All workers have a right
to organize into a union.

01:59:25.599 --> 01:59:29.433
And academic freedom
is guaranteed.

01:59:29.470 --> 01:59:32.337
For the next 65 years

01:59:32.373 --> 01:59:34.432
we would not become the country

01:59:34.475 --> 01:59:36.375
that Roosevelt wanted us to be.

01:59:37.544 --> 01:59:41.207
Instead, we became this...

01:59:48.789 --> 01:59:51.485
I remember thinking
during the Katrina flood,

01:59:51.525 --> 01:59:53.459
"Why is it always the poor

01:59:53.494 --> 01:59:55.325
who have to suffer the misery?

01:59:55.362 --> 01:59:57.796
Why isn't it ever Bernie Madoff
up on the roof

01:59:57.831 --> 01:59:59.526
screaming for help?

01:59:59.566 --> 02:00:01.329
Or the head of Citibank

02:00:01.368 --> 02:00:04.860
or the hedge fund guys
at Goldman Sachs?

02:00:04.905 --> 02:00:07.999
Or the CEO at AIG?"

02:00:08.042 --> 02:00:10.272
It never is these guys, is it?

02:00:10.311 --> 02:00:14.042
It's always those who
never got a slice of the pie

02:00:14.081 --> 02:00:16.379
because these men
took it all

02:00:16.417 --> 02:00:18.647
and left them with nothing,

02:00:18.686 --> 02:00:20.449
left them to die.

02:00:22.990 --> 02:00:25.788
I refuse to live in a country like this.

02:00:25.826 --> 02:00:27.919
And I'm not leaving.

02:00:41.842 --> 02:00:45.175
We live in the richest
country in the world.

02:00:45.212 --> 02:00:48.807
We all deserve a decent job,

02:00:48.849 --> 02:00:52.615
healthcare, a good education,

02:00:52.653 --> 02:00:55.884
a home to call our own.

02:00:55.923 --> 02:00:58.448
We all deserve FDR's dream.

02:01:00.094 --> 02:01:02.358
And it's a crime that we don't have it.

02:01:03.630 --> 02:01:05.257
And we never will,

02:01:05.299 --> 02:01:08.757
as long as we have a system
that enriches the few

02:01:08.802 --> 02:01:11.202
at the expense of the many.

02:01:12.873 --> 02:01:15.433
Capitalism is an evil.

02:01:15.476 --> 02:01:17.535
And you cannot regulate evil.

02:01:19.646 --> 02:01:23.446
You have to eliminate it
and replace it with something

02:01:23.484 --> 02:01:26.510
that is good for all people.

02:01:26.553 --> 02:01:30.512
And that something
is called democracy.

02:01:34.350 --> 02:01:40.150
Subtitles: Arigon

02:01:43.470 --> 02:01:45.995
Crimes have been committed
in this building.

02:01:46.039 --> 02:01:48.803
I am here to make a citizen's arrest.

02:01:48.842 --> 02:01:52.334
Please come down
and step away from the building.

02:01:52.379 --> 02:01:54.574
Do not be afraid.

02:01:54.615 --> 02:01:57.550
Federal prison is a nice place.

02:02:01.622 --> 02:02:04.591
You know,
I can't really do this anymore

02:02:04.625 --> 02:02:07.617
unless those of you who
are watching this in the theater

02:02:07.661 --> 02:02:09.720
want to join me.

02:02:09.763 --> 02:02:11.788
I hope you will.

02:02:11.832 --> 02:02:14.562
And please, speed it up.

02:02:16.370 --> 02:02:20.306
<i>* Arise ye workers
from your slumber</i>

02:02:20.340 --> 02:02:23.741
<i>* Arise ye prisoners of want,
that's right</i>

02:02:23.777 --> 02:02:27.907
<i>* For reason in revolt
now thunders</i>

02:02:27.948 --> 02:02:30.849
<i>* Chains of hatred, greed
and fear</i>

02:02:30.884 --> 02:02:35.344
<i>* Away with all
your superstitions</i>

02:02:35.389 --> 02:02:39.382
<i>* Servile masses arise, arise</i>

02:02:39.426 --> 02:02:43.192
<i>* We'll change henceforth
the old tradition</i>

02:02:43.230 --> 02:02:46.722
<i>* And spurn the dust
to win the prize</i>

02:02:46.767 --> 02:02:50.601
<i>* So comrades, come on and rally</i>

02:02:50.637 --> 02:02:54.437
<i>* And the last fight let us face</i>

02:02:54.475 --> 02:02:57.933
<i>* The Internationale</i>

02:02:57.978 --> 02:03:02.108
<i>* Unites the whole darn
human race</i>

02:03:02.149 --> 02:03:04.379
<i>* So comrades, come on</i>

02:03:04.418 --> 02:03:06.147

02:03:09.957 --> 02:03:13.358
<i>* The Internationale</i>

02:03:13.393 --> 02:03:17.659
<i>* Unites the whole darn human race</i>

02:03:17.698 --> 02:03:21.657
<i>* No more deluded by reaction</i>

02:03:21.702 --> 02:03:25.103
<i>* On tyrants only we'll make war</i>

02:03:25.138 --> 02:03:29.370
<i>* The soldiers too will take strike action</i>

02:03:29.409 --> 02:03:32.435
<i>* They'll break ranks and fight no more</i>

02:03:32.479 --> 02:03:36.643
<i>* And if those cannibals keep trying</i>

02:03:36.683 --> 02:03:40.278
<i>* To sacrifice us to their pride</i>

02:03:40.320 --> 02:03:44.416
<i>* Each at the forge must do their duty</i>

02:03:44.458 --> 02:03:48.019
<i>* And we'll strike while the iron is hot</i>

02:03:48.061 --> 02:03:52.088

02:03:52.132 --> 02:03:55.932

02:03:55.969 --> 02:03:59.132
<i>* The Internationale</i>

02:03:59.172 --> 02:04:03.506

human race</i>

02:04:03.544 --> 02:04:07.344

02:04:07.381 --> 02:04:11.408
<i>* And the last fight let us face</i>

02:04:11.451 --> 02:04:14.579
<i>* The Internationale</i>

02:04:14.621 --> 02:04:20.423
<i>* Unites the whole darn
human race.</i>

02:04:36.176 --> 02:04:39.145
<i>* Jesus Christ was a man</i>

02:04:39.179 --> 02:04:41.739
<i>* That traveled through the land</i>

02:04:41.782 --> 02:04:46.981
<i>* A carpenter true and brave</i>

02:04:47.020 --> 02:04:49.648
<i>* And he said to the rich</i>

02:04:49.690 --> 02:04:52.215
<i>* Give your goods to the poor</i>

02:04:52.259 --> 02:04:57.356
<i>* And they laid Jesus Christ
in the grave</i>

02:04:57.397 --> 02:05:00.161
<i>* He went to the sick</i>

02:05:00.200 --> 02:05:02.998
<i>* And he went to the poor</i>

02:05:03.036 --> 02:05:05.630
<i>* And he went to the hungry</i>

02:05:05.672 --> 02:05:08.232
<i>* And the lame</i>

02:05:08.275 --> 02:05:10.675
<i>* And he said that the meek</i>

02:05:10.711 --> 02:05:13.578
<i>* Would inherit the whole world</i>

02:05:13.614 --> 02:05:18.642
<i>* And they laid Jesus Christ in the grave</i>

02:05:19.820 --> 02:05:21.651
<i>* One day Jesus stopped</i>

02:05:21.688 --> 02:05:24.486
<i>* At a rich man's door</i>

02:05:24.524 --> 02:05:29.484
<i>* What must I do to be saved?</i>

02:05:30.497 --> 02:05:32.658
<i>* Take all you own</i>

02:05:32.699 --> 02:05:35.133
<i>* And give it to the poor</i>

02:05:35.168 --> 02:05:40.333
<i>* And they laid Jesus Christ in the grave</i>

02:05:40.374 --> 02:05:42.865
<i>* When the love of the poor</i>

02:05:42.909 --> 02:05:45.605
<i>* Shall one day turn to hate</i>

02:05:45.646 --> 02:05:48.274
<i>* When the patience of the workers</i>

02:05:48.315 --> 02:05:50.783
<i>* Gives away</i>

02:05:50.817 --> 02:05:53.843
<i>* It would better for the rich</i>

02:05:53.887 --> 02:05:56.412
<i>* If they'd never been born</i>

02:05:56.456 --> 02:06:01.291
<i>* So they laid Jesus Christ in the grave</i>

02:06:07.200 --> 02:06:09.828
<i>* When Jesus came to town</i>

02:06:09.870 --> 02:06:12.430
<i>* All the working folks around</i>

02:06:12.472 --> 02:06:17.705
<i>* Believed what he did say</i>

02:06:17.744 --> 02:06:20.770
<i>* But bankers and preachers</i>

02:06:20.814 --> 02:06:23.044
<i>* Nailed him to the cross</i>

02:06:23.083 --> 02:06:28.077
<i>* And they laid Jesus Christ in the grave</i>

02:06:28.121 --> 02:06:30.885
<i>* Well, the people held their breath</i>

02:06:30.924 --> 02:06:33.791
<i>* When they heard about his death</i>

02:06:33.827 --> 02:06:39.060
<i>* And everybody wondered why</i>

02:06:39.099 --> 02:06:42.262
<i>* It was the landlord and soldiers</i>

02:06:42.302 --> 02:06:44.429
<i>* Lawmen they had hired</i>

02:06:44.471 --> 02:06:49.738
<i>* That nailed Jesus Christ in the sky</i>

02:06:49.776 --> 02:06:52.609
<i>* We would lay Jesus Christ</i>

02:06:52.646 --> 02:06:55.274
<i>* In the grave, Lord, Lord</i>

02:06:55.315 --> 02:06:59.411
<i>* We would lay Jesus Christ
in the grave</i>

02:07:00.420 --> 02:07:03.014
<i>* If Jesus preached today</i>

02:07:03.056 --> 02:07:05.820
<i>* Like he preached in Galilee</i>

02:07:05.859 --> 02:07:10.694
<i>* They would lay Jesus Christ
in his grave.</i>
