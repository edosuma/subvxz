01:38.264 --> 01:40.850
I sense you know
you're gonna win this first game.

01:41.601 --> 01:42.811
-I sense that.
-What'd you say?

01:42.894 --> 01:45.438
Whatever it is, it's "Yes. No. Maybe."

01:46.898 --> 01:50.401
Coming into the final series, what's your
mental preparation like on game day?

01:51.069 --> 01:53.196
Yes. No. Maybe. Whatever that was.

02:29.065 --> 02:30.441
I got up, I stretched...

02:31.568 --> 02:32.944
had a couple beers...

02:34.404 --> 02:35.864
played the piano...

02:35.947 --> 02:36.865
one cigar.

02:37.782 --> 02:39.284
In the lobby bar?

02:39.951 --> 02:41.411
No, in my room.

02:42.745 --> 02:44.998
I've got a piano in my room, man.
I was in there...

02:45.540 --> 02:46.916
It's called the Jordan Bar.

02:47.542 --> 02:50.003
You see that go in?
Don't look at my fuckin' feet.

02:50.879 --> 02:52.505
Look at where the ball is going.

04:34.732 --> 04:36.693
Remember what we talked about
with your breathing,

04:36.776 --> 04:39.570
and your centering,
and getting yourself focused to the court.

04:39.654 --> 04:43.032
You guys know that you gotta support
yourselves and your teammates.

04:43.116 --> 04:46.286
Here in this building,
it's like sheep to the wolves.

04:52.375 --> 04:54.460
In '98, were you guys in Utah?

07:50.178 --> 07:51.345
Three more, three more.

07:53.681 --> 07:55.349
They swept LA.

07:55.433 --> 07:58.811
You know how much it takes to guard Shaq
and try to push that motherfucker around?

07:58.895 --> 08:00.771
That ain't the point. I ain't Shaq.

08:01.647 --> 08:02.690
I ain't Shaq.

08:03.733 --> 08:05.568
Like I said, I ain't Shaq.

09:23.354 --> 09:25.439
Now Bill's the only one who ain't scored.

10:21.287 --> 10:23.539
Is it true
that Dennis wasn't at practice today?

10:24.415 --> 10:25.625
Is that an excused absence?

11:51.377 --> 11:53.421
Dickey, you weren't here
at the start were you?

11:53.504 --> 11:54.338
No.

11:54.839 --> 11:58.134
We beat up Dennis with some boffers.
You got to miss out on that shit.

11:59.051 --> 12:03.597
Because he brought fame
and disreputation on all of us.

12:04.348 --> 12:05.474
We were dishonored.

12:05.558 --> 12:07.393
That's a good piece of money though.

12:11.105 --> 12:15.025
Come on, Rodzilla! Rodzilla!

12:32.501 --> 12:36.005
Does it bother you that he's taking away
the focus from the Finals?

15:30.471 --> 15:32.222
Hey, try not to be dogshit tonight, dog.

15:32.306 --> 15:34.266
For one time, come out ready to play.

15:41.607 --> 15:43.275
You go out there, play hard, and we win,

15:43.359 --> 15:45.402
you don't have to hear me
no more, ever again!

15:45.486 --> 15:47.738
-I'm going to California with you.
-Shit!

15:47.821 --> 15:51.283
-What time is our flight?
-Scott, after tonight...

15:52.409 --> 15:55.120
if I ever see you again,
I'm gonna whip your ass.

15:58.123 --> 15:59.917
You know I'mma whip your ass.

16:00.542 --> 16:02.503
If it's in a bar,
I'mma start a barroom brawl.

16:04.213 --> 16:07.841
Are your shoes okay? I don't want you
sliding all over the damn place out there.

16:08.467 --> 16:11.762
I'mma slide a ring on your hand tonight,
Tex. That's all you need to know.

18:45.207 --> 18:46.667
The calm before the storm.

18:47.209 --> 18:48.669
Not a lot of joking today?

18:55.592 --> 18:56.885
Might see the kill today.

19:17.823 --> 19:19.241
Everybody got their hand in?

19:19.324 --> 19:21.368
Hand in means
"All for one, and one for all."

22:39.024 --> 22:40.734
Can you start? Really?

22:41.735 --> 22:42.778
All right.

27:59.886 --> 28:02.806
What's going through your head
when you're coming back up the floor?

31:31.806 --> 31:33.850
Oh, my God! That was beautiful!

31:33.933 --> 31:36.227
-What a finish!
-I had faith! I had faith!

31:36.311 --> 31:38.897
I'll bet you did. God bless you.

31:57.332 --> 31:58.958
-Can you believe it?
-Yeah, I can.

31:59.042 --> 32:00.001
I can't believe it.

32:00.084 --> 32:02.128
-I believed in it.
-That was beautiful.

32:02.712 --> 32:04.714
I never gave up. I never gave up.

32:04.797 --> 32:08.134
Every time we were close,
I knew we were gonna do it. I knew it.

33:16.077 --> 33:19.414
-What was you watching this afternoon?
-I was watching <i>Man with the Iron Face.</i>

33:19.497 --> 33:21.666
-Iron Mask.
-Iron Mask.

33:22.458 --> 33:23.584
And he's here!

33:23.668 --> 33:26.004
You know what I told the guys
when we stuck our hands in?

33:26.087 --> 33:27.630
-What?
-All for one and one for all.

33:29.716 --> 33:31.676
-Congratulations.
-Thank you. I'm glad you came.

33:31.759 --> 33:34.637
You did some beautiful stuff
just now, man. That was poetic.

33:34.721 --> 33:35.972
Thank you. Thank you very much.

33:54.115 --> 33:56.075
Greatest team to ever play this game.

33:56.159 --> 33:58.369
You just gotta respect it.
If they don't respect that?

33:59.704 --> 34:02.123
There's a lot of people
doing a lot of illegal drugs.

34:02.999 --> 34:04.834
-Thanks, man.
-That's what it is. That's it.

34:06.335 --> 34:07.920
Can you imagine? It's still daylight.

34:08.004 --> 34:10.548
We might be able
to get some golf swings in.

36:20.386 --> 36:21.721
Got another one in ya?

41:26.859 --> 41:28.194
Let me play you...

41:28.944 --> 41:32.114
This is Jerry Reinsdorf saying why
he had to break the team up.

44:00.346 --> 44:04.391
So, was it then satisfying
to leave at your peak?

44:05.392 --> 44:07.269
Or is it maddening to leave at your peak?
