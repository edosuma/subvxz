00:10.161 --> 00:12.661
¶¶

00:12.763 --> 00:14.897
SUE AIKENS: DID YOU GET
THE JET FUEL THIS TIME?

00:14.999 --> 00:16.198
MAN: CHECK-CHECK.

00:16.333 --> 00:19.435
SUE AIKENS: ALL RIGHTY, BUDDY,
I'LL SEE YOU IN A FEW MINUTES.

00:20.237 --> 00:21.370
FUEL PLANE CAME IN.

00:21.472 --> 00:23.539
THE LAST
FUEL OF THE SEASON.

00:23.641 --> 00:26.875
IT REPRESENTS WRAPPING
UP EVERYTHING THAT I'VE DONE

00:26.977 --> 00:30.713
SINCE THE LAST SNOW MELTED,
SINCE THE SPRING CAME.

00:31.682 --> 00:34.650
SEEING THE PLANES IS
ALWAYS ONE OF MY BIGGEST JOYS.

00:34.752 --> 00:37.753
BUT IT'S ALSO
SIGNALING THE END OF ONE ERA;

00:37.855 --> 00:40.289
THE ISSUING IN OF THE NEXT.

00:40.391 --> 00:43.492
WINTER IS ONE
COLD HARD BITCH.

00:45.362 --> 00:46.862
MY NAME IS SUSAN AIKENS.

00:46.964 --> 00:50.966
I AM THE SOLE RESIDENT AND
CARETAKER OF KAVIK RIVER CAMP,

00:51.068 --> 00:52.801
UP ON THE NORTH
SLOPE OF ALASKA.

00:52.903 --> 00:56.405
I'M ABOUT 500 MILES
FROM THE CLOSEST BIG CITY,

00:56.507 --> 00:59.575
15 MILES FROM
THE ARCTIC OCEAN.

01:02.880 --> 01:05.214
KAVIK IS A SAFETY ZONE,
A PLACE TO GET FOOD,

01:05.316 --> 01:08.350
A PLACE TO GET HEAT,
A PLACE TO COMMUNICATE.

01:09.053 --> 01:10.986
THAT'S THE
MAIN GOAL OF KAVIK.

01:11.088 --> 01:13.422
WHEN I FIRST
GOT HERE, I CRIED.

01:13.524 --> 01:14.590
THAT WAS MY
FIRST REACTION.

01:14.692 --> 01:15.824
THERE WAS SO MUCH TO DO.

01:15.926 --> 01:18.293
BUT I'VE WORKED AT
IT AND I'VE MORPHED IT,

01:18.395 --> 01:21.096
AND I'VE BECOME IT.

01:25.236 --> 01:28.303
IT'S ONE OF THE LAST
BITS OF REAL ESTATE THAT YOU

01:28.405 --> 01:30.038
CAN GO TO THAT'S NOT TAME.

01:30.141 --> 01:33.408
IT'S NOT BEEN
GROOMED TO FIT A POSTCARD.

01:33.511 --> 01:35.778
IT'S WILD.

01:36.547 --> 01:39.681
THE ABSENCE OF SOCIETY
GAVE ME THE NURTURING

01:39.784 --> 01:41.416
THAT SOCIETY NEVER DID.

01:41.519 --> 01:43.552
THIS IS THE ALONE
TIME THAT I CRAVE.

01:43.654 --> 01:45.921
THIS IS THE TIME
WHERE I CAN SAY, "HEY,

01:46.023 --> 01:48.924
HOW ABOUT A LITTLE
ADVENTURE FOR ME?"

01:54.632 --> 01:55.864
HAVE A GOOD WINTER.

01:55.966 --> 01:56.899
PILOT: YEAH.

01:57.001 --> 01:58.267
SUE AIKENS:
THANK YOU, GUYS.

01:58.369 --> 01:59.768
I'M DONE WITH
MY SUMMER CYCLE.

01:59.870 --> 02:01.770
I'M DONE WITH
MY PEOPLE CYCLE,

02:01.872 --> 02:06.341
AND NOW IT'S THE GLORY OF,
THIS IS ALL GONNA BE DARKNESS,

02:06.944 --> 02:09.778
SNOW, AND COLD.

02:15.853 --> 02:18.520
LIKE ANY ANIMAL, YOU
GET PREPARED FOR THE WINTER,

02:18.622 --> 02:22.191
OR YOU DON'T MAKE
IT THROUGH THE WINTER.

02:29.500 --> 02:33.535
¶<i> [THEME MUSIC PLAYING]. ¶</i>

02:44.048 --> 02:45.814
NOW THAT THE FUEL
PLANE HAS LANDED,

02:45.916 --> 02:47.482
I'VE GOT ENOUGH
FUEL FOR THE WINTER.

02:47.585 --> 02:48.717
MY CHORES ARE DONE.

02:48.819 --> 02:49.885
CAMP IS SECURE.

02:49.987 --> 02:52.621
I FEEL SOLID ABOUT
WHERE KAVIK IS AT RIGHT NOW.

02:52.723 --> 02:54.256
THIS IS MY TIME,
I WANNA TAKE IT.

02:54.358 --> 02:55.924
I WANNA GO HAVE
SOME ADVENTURE.

02:56.026 --> 02:58.093
I'VE BEEN APPROVED
FEDERAL SUBSISTENCE,

02:58.195 --> 03:00.629
SO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
SAID, "YOU'RE GOOD TO GO, SUE.

03:00.731 --> 03:03.866
HERE'S YOUR TAGS,
HERE'S YOUR BOOK.

03:03.968 --> 03:06.969
YOU CAN GO
HUNT IN THE REFUGE."

03:07.071 --> 03:10.372
ONE OF THE MOST TALKED ABOUT
PIECES OF REAL ESTATE ON THIS

03:10.474 --> 03:13.375
BLUE PLANET IS THE ARCTIC
NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE.

03:13.477 --> 03:14.676
IT'S 10 MILES AWAY.

03:14.778 --> 03:16.278
THERE'S NOT A
ROAD GOING THROUGH IT.

03:16.380 --> 03:18.146
I'VE GOTTA
TAKE AN AIRPLANE.

03:18.249 --> 03:19.948
THIS IS
A DANGEROUS PLACE.

03:20.050 --> 03:22.951
IT'S NATURE IN
ITS PUREST FORM.

03:23.053 --> 03:24.753
YOU'VE GOT SOME OF
THE TALLEST MOUNTAINS,

03:24.855 --> 03:27.422
SOME OF THE LONGEST RIVERS,
SOME OF THE MOST BRUTAL

03:27.524 --> 03:31.026
CONDITIONS, AND SOME OF
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SCENERY.

03:32.563 --> 03:36.531
AND FOR MY PERSONALITY,
THAT'S LIKE GOING TO CHURCH.

03:38.469 --> 03:41.837
SO FOR ME, I'M GONNA BE
DOING POSSIBLY SHEEP, BEAR,

03:41.939 --> 03:44.006
WOLVERINE, WOLF, LYNX.

03:44.108 --> 03:45.841
THAT'S AN AREA
I CAN FIND LYNX.

03:45.943 --> 03:48.143
IT'LL JUST BE ME,
THE NORTHERN LIGHTS,

03:48.245 --> 03:52.314
AND MAYBE SOME SPOOKY ANIMALS,
MAYBE SOME FUN ANIMALS.

03:52.516 --> 03:55.717
I DON'T KNOW WHICH, BUT I'VE
GOT TO BE PREPARED FOR IT ALL.

03:55.819 --> 03:57.152
SO, I'VE GOT MY WEAPONS.

03:57.254 --> 04:00.555
LONG RANGE, SHORT
RANGE, BIG GAME, SMALL GAME.

04:01.659 --> 04:05.027
I SURVIVE OFF THE GAME MEAT
FOR 10 MONTHS OUT OF THE YEAR.

04:07.231 --> 04:10.332
REFUGE, HERE I COME.

04:15.773 --> 04:17.406
AGNES HAILSTONE: IT'S
GONNA BE A LONG, COLD WINTER,

04:17.508 --> 04:20.309
BUT THAT'S WHY WE
CONSTANTLY PREPARE.

04:27.451 --> 04:28.550
HELLO, GIRLS.

04:28.652 --> 04:30.018
TINMIAQ HAILSTONE: HI, MOM.

04:30.120 --> 04:32.187
AGNES HAILSTONE: THANK
YOU, I WAS JUST TRYING TO FIX

04:32.289 --> 04:33.322
THIS RACK UP.

04:33.424 --> 04:34.623
I THINK WE NEED
TO GO FILL IT UP.

04:34.725 --> 04:35.824
TINMIAQ HAILSTONE: YEAH.

04:35.926 --> 04:37.125
AGNES HAILSTONE:
IT'S REAL EMPTY.

04:37.227 --> 04:38.660
TINMIAQ HAILSTONE:
PRETTY EMPTY RACKS, HUH?

04:38.762 --> 04:39.928
AGNES HAILSTONE: YUP.

04:40.030 --> 04:42.064
SO IT'S ALMOST WINTER AND
THE CARIBOU IS STARTING TO GET

04:42.166 --> 04:44.166
INTO RUT, SO THIS IS THE
TIME OF THE YEAR WHERE WE

04:44.268 --> 04:46.335
HAVE TO GO DO OUR
ONCE-A-YEAR CARIBOU HUNT.

04:46.437 --> 04:48.503
READY THEN,
LET'S GO HUNTING.

04:48.605 --> 04:51.006
I'M AGNES HAILSTONE
AND I'M 100% INUPIAT.

04:52.209 --> 04:53.942
I'M FROM NOORVIK, ALASKA.

04:54.044 --> 04:56.144
I LIVE HERE WITH
MY FIVE DAUGHTERS.

04:56.447 --> 04:58.714
I'M MARRIED
TO CHIP HAILSTONE.

04:59.316 --> 05:01.350
I LIVE A TRADITIONAL
LIFESTYLE AND I TRY TO TEACH

05:01.452 --> 05:04.019
MY FIVE DAUGHTERS
THE SAME WAY OF LIVING.

05:04.888 --> 05:07.656
WE LOVE TO HUNT, FISH,
GATHER, AND BE ACTIVE OUTDOORS.

05:08.359 --> 05:10.993
I LOVE TRAVELING AROUND THE
WHOLE AREA AND I LOVE DOING IT

05:11.095 --> 05:13.829
WITH MY FAMILY.

05:16.433 --> 05:18.500
EVEN THOUGH YOUR DAD'S
GONE, EVEN THOUGH HE'S GONE,

05:18.602 --> 05:20.702
WE KNOW WHERE WE'RE GOING
AND WHERE THE CARIBOU ARE,

05:20.804 --> 05:23.205
AND IT'S TIME TO GO HUNTING,
AND EVEN CHIP'S NOT HERE,

05:23.307 --> 05:25.107
WE'RE JUST GONNA
HAVE TO GO WITHOUT HIM.

05:26.910 --> 05:29.444
<i>NARRATOR: AGNES HAILSTONE'S</i>
<i>HUSBAND CHIP RECENTLY TURNED</i>

05:29.546 --> 05:32.014
<i>HIMSELF OVER TO THE</i>
<i>ANCHORAGE CORRECTIONAL COMPLEX</i>

05:32.649 --> 05:34.516
<i>TO SERVE A</i>
<i>15-MONTH SENTENCE.</i>

05:34.818 --> 05:37.285
CHIP HAILSTONE: I GOT
CONVICTED OF TWO PERJURY,

05:37.388 --> 05:40.355
AND TWO FALSE REPORTS, SO
I DID THREE YEARS OF PROBATION,

05:40.457 --> 05:42.958
AND I HAVE TO DO TIME
FOR THE TWO MISDEMEANORS.

05:43.060 --> 05:44.860
GOTTA GO WHEN YOU GOTTA GO.

05:44.962 --> 05:47.429
YOU GUYS ARE IN
CAPABLE HANDS OF EACH OTHER.

05:47.531 --> 05:49.464
YOU GUYS ALL
KNOW WHAT TO DO.

05:49.933 --> 05:52.000
AGNES HAILSTONE:
THERE'S HIS PLANE.

05:53.570 --> 05:55.337
CHIP HAILSTONE:
LOVE YOU, GIRLS.

05:55.439 --> 05:57.105
AGNES HAILSTONE: WITH
THE GIRLS BEHIND ME,

05:57.207 --> 05:59.808
THAT'S WHAT MAKES THIS
WHOLE THING A LOT EASIER.

05:59.910 --> 06:02.077
EVEN THOUGH IT'S A
(BLEEP) THING TO DO,

06:02.179 --> 06:03.812
TO GO BRING MY
HUSBAND TO THE AIRPORT AND

06:03.914 --> 06:05.180
SEND HIM OFF TO JAIL.

06:05.282 --> 06:06.448
TINMIAQ HAILSTONE: I LOVE YA.

06:06.550 --> 06:08.383
CHIP HAILSTONE: BYE-BYE,
GOODBYE, I'LL SEE YOU.

06:08.485 --> 06:09.818
TINMIAQ HAILSTONE:
I LOVE YOU, DAD!

06:09.920 --> 06:10.786
CHIP HAILSTONE:
LOVE YOU, BUNS.

06:10.888 --> 06:11.853
QUTAN HAILSTONE:
LOVE YOU, DAD!

06:11.955 --> 06:13.088
CHIP HAILSTONE:
SEE YOU, AGNES.

06:13.190 --> 06:15.490
CAROL HAILSTONE:
BE CAREFUL.

06:24.868 --> 06:27.169
<i>NARRATOR: WITHOUT HER</i>
<i>HUSBAND AND HUNTING PARTNER,</i>

06:27.271 --> 06:29.404

06:29.506 --> 06:32.607

06:33.444 --> 06:36.011
<i>WITH WINTER ON THE HORIZON,</i>

06:36.113 --> 06:39.114
<i>HUNT BULL CARIBOU AS THEY</i>
<i>MIGRATE THROUGH THE AREA,</i>

06:39.216 --> 06:41.583
<i>TIME IS CRUCIAL.</i>

06:43.520 --> 06:45.520
AGNES HAILSTONE: IT'S WEIRD
GOING OUT HUNTING WITH ONLY

06:45.622 --> 06:47.589
US GIRLS,
BUT WE CAN DO THIS.

06:49.259 --> 06:51.660
TINMIAQ HAILSTONE: READY
TO GO CATCH SOME CARIBOU?

06:52.129 --> 06:54.329
AGNES HAILSTONE: MY MEAT
RACK IS TOTALLY EMPTY AND

06:54.431 --> 06:55.497
IT'S ALMOST WINTER.

06:55.599 --> 06:57.365
HOPEFULLY, BY THE TIME
I'M DONE WITH THIS HUNT,

06:57.468 --> 06:59.434
I'LL HAVE AT LEAST
FIVE OR SIX CARIBOU,

06:59.536 --> 07:02.904
AND THEN I'LL BE ABLE TO CUT
MEAT ALL WINTER FOR US GIRLS.

07:03.574 --> 07:06.074
THERE'S BEEN A WHOLE
HERD OF CARIBOU CROSSING,

07:06.176 --> 07:09.144
TRYING TO HEAD SOUTH, SO
WE'RE GONNA GO SEE IF WE COULD

07:09.246 --> 07:13.181
SCORE A FEW CARIBOU BULLS.

07:13.484 --> 07:16.184
THE GIRLS AND I PLAN TO
HUNT THE CARIBOU WHILE

07:16.286 --> 07:17.652
THEY'RE CROSSING THE RIVER.

07:17.754 --> 07:20.956
IT'S A SAFE AND EFFICIENT WAY
FOR US TO GET THIS HUNT DONE.

07:21.792 --> 07:24.392
OH, I SEE A CARIBOU
OVER THERE ALREADY, WHOO!

07:25.028 --> 07:28.263
GIRLS, THEY'RE ALREADY HERE.

07:28.365 --> 07:31.500
KEEP STILL,
GIRLS, KEEP STILL.

07:32.202 --> 07:33.735
THERE ARE NO BULLS.

07:33.837 --> 07:38.373
THOSE ARE COWS, AND CALVES, SO
WE'RE JUST GONNA LET THOSE GO.

07:39.676 --> 07:42.544
THIS SEEMS TO BE A GOOD PLACE
WHERE THE CARIBOU ARE CROSSING.

07:43.180 --> 07:45.247
SO WHEN WE SEE A CARIBOU
GETTING READY TO CROSS,

07:45.349 --> 07:47.249
WE ALWAYS JUST KILL
OUR MOTOR AND JUST DRIFT

07:47.351 --> 07:49.751
AND WAIT FOR THE
CARIBOU TO GET INTO THE WATER,

07:49.853 --> 07:51.620
AND THEN WE WILL GO AFTER
THEM ONCE THEY HIT THE MIDDLE

07:51.722 --> 07:55.056
AND WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY
TO CHOOSE AND GO AROUND THEM.

07:58.495 --> 07:59.628
TINMIAQ HAILSTONE:
NO BULLS, MOM.

07:59.730 --> 08:00.862
AGNES HAILSTONE:
NO BULLS, OKAY.

08:00.964 --> 08:02.364
TINMIAQ HAILSTONE:
NO BULLS.

08:02.466 --> 08:03.932
AGNES HAILSTONE: WE'RE
JUST GONNA PASS THEM

08:04.034 --> 08:06.568
AND LET THEM GO, OKAY?

08:06.670 --> 08:08.436
I MEAN, WE'VE SEEN
SOME COWS AND CALVES,

08:08.539 --> 08:11.973
BUT WE'RE REALLY INTERESTED
IN THE BULLS, THE FAT BULLS,

08:12.075 --> 08:15.210
SO WE JUST LET THE
COWS AND CALVES GO.

08:17.114 --> 08:18.780
WE HAVEN'T COME
ACROSS ANYTHING ELSE,

08:18.882 --> 08:21.883
SO PRETTY MUCH THE HERD MUST
BE CLOSER TO NOORVIK AND WE'RE

08:21.985 --> 08:24.319
KIND OF FAR UP THE RIVER,
SO WE'RE JUST GONNA HEAD BACK

08:24.421 --> 08:26.922
DOWNRIVER,
GO TOWARDS NOORVIK.

08:27.024 --> 08:29.524
WE'RE GONNA TRY AGAIN
TOMORROW, AND THE NEXT DAY,

08:29.626 --> 08:32.327
BECAUSE WE HAVE ONLY A
FEW DAYS LEFT BEFORE THE BULL

08:32.429 --> 08:35.096
CARIBOU ACTUALLY GO INTO RUT.

08:36.466 --> 08:40.535
WE NEED TO GO GET ENOUGH MEAT
TO START US OFF FOR THE WINTER.

08:41.438 --> 08:43.905
THANK YOU, GIRLS,
FOR BEING SO TOUGH.

08:47.978 --> 08:50.579
JESSIE HOLMES: YOU DON'T RUN
AROUND CHASING THE DOLLAR BILL.

08:50.681 --> 08:53.215
YOU RUN AROUND
CHASING THE RESOURCES.

08:58.622 --> 09:01.623
I GOT 47 DOGS TO
KEEP THROUGH THIS WINTER.

09:01.858 --> 09:03.758
HERE, I GOT 100 FISH.

09:03.860 --> 09:06.661
THIS ISN'T GONNA LAST ME
BUT A WEEK FEEDING THE DOGS.

09:08.966 --> 09:11.399
I NEED NEAR 3,000 TO BE ABLE
TO FEED THEM THROUGH THE WINTER.

09:13.604 --> 09:15.704
I GOT A FRIEND WHO'S GONNA
LET ME USE HIS FISH WHEEL,

09:15.806 --> 09:17.639
MINE'S SMASHED, DESTROYED.

09:17.908 --> 09:19.841
I'VE BEEN KIND OF LIMPING IT
ALONG ON ITS LAST LEG FOR THE

09:19.943 --> 09:23.778
LAST COUPLE OF YEARS HERE,
SO I TIED IT UP DOWNRIVER.

09:25.148 --> 09:28.049
GETTING THIS BOAT AND
MOTOR GOING IS ESSENTIAL

09:28.585 --> 09:30.452
AND CRUCIAL
TO MY OPERATION.

09:30.554 --> 09:32.020
THIS BOAT'S
PRETTY MUCH NEW.

09:32.122 --> 09:34.422
SPENT WEEKS GETTING IT
DONE JUST SO I COULD BE OUT

09:34.524 --> 09:36.825
HERE FISHING, AND THEN,
OF COURSE, THE MOTOR BLEW UP.

09:37.261 --> 09:40.362
THAT'S HOW IT GOES SOMETIMES,
BUT I'M NOT GONNA GIVE UP.

09:41.131 --> 09:42.197
MY NAME IS JESSIE HOLMES.

09:42.299 --> 09:44.132
I'M ORIGINALLY
FROM ALABAMA.

09:44.234 --> 09:46.268
I NOW RESIDE
IN NENANA, ALASKA.

09:47.170 --> 09:49.170
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A
GOOD-HEARTED PERSON, BUT,

09:49.273 --> 09:50.805
YOU KNOW, I GOT MYSELF
AROUND SOME OF THE WRONG

09:50.907 --> 09:54.109
PEOPLE WHEN I WAS YOUNGER
AND I WAS KIND OF LOST AND,

09:54.211 --> 09:56.544
MOVING UP HERE TO ALASKA
AND FINDING THE RIVERS AND

09:56.647 --> 09:59.180
THE MOUNTAINS AND THE
DOGS, THEY REDEEMED ME.

09:59.283 --> 10:01.449
MADE ME LEARN HOW
TO BE RESPONSIBLE.

10:01.551 --> 10:03.752
THEY GAVE ME
SOMETHING TO LIVE FOR.

10:04.688 --> 10:07.922
WITH ME HAVING 47 DOGS,
LIFE ISN'T ABOUT LUXURY

10:08.158 --> 10:09.257
OR A VACATION.

10:09.359 --> 10:10.759
ALL THE
MONEY GOES INTO THEM.

10:10.861 --> 10:13.662
I CAN'T REALLY AFFORD TO
HAVE RUNNING WATER, ELECTRICITY.

10:13.764 --> 10:16.798
IT'S A REWARDING FEELING AT
THE END OF THE DAY TO DIG DEEP,

10:16.900 --> 10:20.268
AND SACRIFICE ALL MY OWN
PERSONAL NEEDS FOR THESE DOGS.

10:21.505 --> 10:23.738
WHEN I THINK OF FAMILY, I
THINK OF MY ALASKAN FAMILY AND

10:23.840 --> 10:26.675
ALL THE PEOPLE WHO'VE ADOPTED
ME ALONG THE WAY, INSPIRED ME,

10:26.910 --> 10:28.643
AND SEEN THE
GOOD THINGS IN ME,

10:28.745 --> 10:31.546
AND HELPED BUILD ME UP
INSTEAD OF TEAR ME DOWN.

10:36.386 --> 10:38.320
NOW THIS THING'S
GONNA BE MOUNTED ON,

10:38.422 --> 10:40.989
AND I CAN MOVE ON TO
GETTING THIS ALL HOOKED UP

10:41.091 --> 10:42.157
AND ALL THE CONNECTIONS.

10:42.259 --> 10:44.626
I GOTTA BUILD A
STEERING CONSOLE.

10:44.961 --> 10:46.594
THERE AIN'T NO WAY TO
GET THESE JOBS DONE WITHOUT

10:46.697 --> 10:48.663
GETTING YOUR HANDS DIRTY.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.167
THIS IS NOT A
PERFECTLY CLEAN LIFESTYLE,

10:52.269 --> 10:54.636
DEALING WITH FISH,
MOTORS, WOOD.

10:54.738 --> 10:57.339
LAST PRIORITY Y GOT IS A
WARM SHOWER IN THE EVENING.

10:57.641 --> 11:00.041
I'M LUCKY TO GET A
WARM SHOWER ONCE A MONTH.

11:00.477 --> 11:02.277
IF I CAN GET THIS ALL
TOGETHER AND GET DOWN HERE TO

11:02.379 --> 11:04.879
THIS WHEEL, I MIGHT BE ABLE
TO PUT UP A FEW THOUSAND FISH,

11:04.981 --> 11:07.649
WHICH IS
EXACTLY WHAT I NEED.

11:13.890 --> 11:17.158
DROPPING THE BOAT IN,
HOPING IT STARTS RIGHT UP,

11:17.461 --> 11:19.127
'CAUSE IT'D BE GREAT TO MAKE
IT DOWN TO THE FISH WHEEL AND

11:19.229 --> 11:20.795
GET IT STARTED RIGHT NOW.

11:20.897 --> 11:22.397
STILL GOT DAYLIGHT.

11:25.402 --> 11:28.903
<i>[ENGINE SPUTTERING]</i>

11:29.005 --> 11:30.338
I DON'T LIKE
THAT SOUND, MAN.

11:30.440 --> 11:33.007
THAT SOUNDS (BLEEP) UP.

11:37.047 --> 11:41.082
(BLEEP), (BLEEP), (BLEEP),
IT'S JUST DYING OUT.

11:42.619 --> 11:45.787
IT'S NOT GOING,
IT'S NOT GOOD THOUGH.

11:46.857 --> 11:49.290
I'M IN A HURRY TO GET THIS ALL
DONE 'CAUSE I'M RACING AGAINST

11:49.393 --> 11:52.560
TIME AND THE WEATHER, BUT IF
I'M IN TOO MUCH OF A HURRY AND

11:52.662 --> 11:54.229
I DO SOMETHING WRONG,
IT COULD REALLY COST ME OUT

11:54.331 --> 11:55.830
THERE ON THE WATER.

11:55.932 --> 11:58.466
I'D KINDA BE IN A PRETTY
JEOPARDOUS SITUATION IF I

11:58.568 --> 12:01.202
SPENT ALL THIS MONEY AND
I DON'T GET TO GET THESE FISH.

12:08.779 --> 12:11.646
¶ ¶

12:11.748 --> 12:14.149
THIS IS REALLY BAD
DEAL FOR ME BECAUSE I NEED

12:14.251 --> 12:15.450
TO GET THESE FISH.

12:15.552 --> 12:17.752
SOUNDS LIKE
CYLINDERS CLINKING,

12:17.854 --> 12:21.022
WHICH IS SOMETHING I
CAN'T FIX AND IS A MAJOR DEAL.

12:21.124 --> 12:23.057
I JUST LOST A LOT
OF MONEY ON THIS MOTOR.

12:23.160 --> 12:25.794
A LOT OF TIME,
TIME'S EVERYTHING UP HERE.

12:25.896 --> 12:27.962
I MEAN, I'M GONNA HAVE
TO ASK SOMEBODY FOR HELP HERE.

12:28.064 --> 12:29.998
I GOT TO KIND OF GO
TO SLEEP ON THIS 'CAUSE

12:30.100 --> 12:31.232
IT'S GETTING LATE.

12:31.368 --> 12:34.402
I GOT TO GO FEED THE DOGS,
FIGURE OUT WHAT I'M GONNA DO.

12:39.709 --> 12:40.909
GLENN VILLENEUVE:
FEAR IS A GOOD THING.

12:41.011 --> 12:42.610
IT CAN PROTECT YOU,
BUT IT CAN HINDER YOU, TOO.

12:42.712 --> 12:45.180
WHAT I FEAR IS JUST
LETTING LIFE PASS BY WITHOUT

12:45.282 --> 12:47.615
REALLY LIVING
IT TO THE FULLEST.

12:55.592 --> 12:58.793
I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THIS
TREE UP HERE BEHIND THE CABIN.

12:58.895 --> 13:00.695
IT'S DEAD.

13:00.797 --> 13:03.231
IT'S GOT A
BAD LEAN IN IT.

13:03.333 --> 13:05.467
IT COULD GET BLOWN DOWN
WHEN THE WIND COMES UP.

13:05.569 --> 13:08.636
I'VE HAD A FEW TREES FALL
DOWN RIGHT HERE IN THE YARD.

13:08.738 --> 13:12.006
THAT THING HIT THE CABIN,
THAT'D BE TERRIBLE.

13:12.108 --> 13:14.776
GONNA HAVE TO DO
SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

13:14.878 --> 13:16.744
THAT TREE IS
GONNA HAVE TO GO.

13:22.419 --> 13:23.751
MY NAME IS
GLENN VILLENEUVE.

13:23.854 --> 13:25.854
I LIVE UP IN THE BROOKS
RANGE, NORTHERN ALASKA.

13:25.956 --> 13:28.490
200 MILES FROM
THE NEAREST CITY.

13:29.626 --> 13:31.659
I GREW UP IN VERMONT,
RUNNING AROUND IN THE WOODS

13:31.761 --> 13:32.894
AND THE MOUNTAINS
WHEN I WAS A KID.

13:32.996 --> 13:34.162
I ALWAYS LIKED THAT.

13:34.264 --> 13:35.830
I GOT THIS
IDEA 20 YEARS AGO.

13:35.932 --> 13:37.832
I WANTED TO LEARN TO
LIVE OUT IN THE WILDERNESS.

13:37.934 --> 13:39.167
I DECIDED TO
MOVE UP TO ALASKA,

13:39.269 --> 13:42.036
BUT IT TOOK A LOT
OF TIME TO GET HERE.

13:43.106 --> 13:44.439
I DIDN'T COME OUT HERE
TO GET AWAY FROM PEOPLE,

13:44.541 --> 13:46.241
I GOT OUT HERE TO
GET CLOSER TO NATURE,

13:46.343 --> 13:49.944
TO GET CLOSER TO THE
ANIMALS, THE WILDLIFE.

13:50.046 --> 13:52.714
THERE ARE NOT MANY PLACES
WHERE YOU CAN LIVE LIKE THIS,

13:52.816 --> 13:55.416
AND IT DEMANDS A
LOT OF COMPETENCE.

13:55.519 --> 13:56.718
WHEN I FIRST CAME OUT HERE,

13:56.820 --> 13:59.287
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I
WAS DOING, IT TOOK TIME.

13:59.389 --> 14:02.624
THIS IS THE MOST
WILD, THE MOST EXTREME,

14:02.726 --> 14:05.827
THE MOST REMOTE PLACE I
COULD FIND TO LIVE IN THE WORLD.

14:07.197 --> 14:09.230
AND I LOVE IT OUT HERE.

14:10.433 --> 14:11.966
I DON'T HAVE
TO LIVE THIS WAY.

14:12.068 --> 14:14.002
IF I WANTED TO, I
COULD DO SOMETHING ELSE.

14:14.104 --> 14:15.937
I DO IT
BECAUSE I ENJOY IT.

14:16.873 --> 14:19.274
I LIKE TO TRY THINGS OUT,
I LIKE TO PUSH MYSELF.

14:19.376 --> 14:20.675
IT KEEPS
LIFE INTERESTING.

14:20.777 --> 14:22.777
YOU GOT TO STAY ON
YOUR TOES OUT HERE.

14:32.489 --> 14:35.356
¶ ¶

14:35.458 --> 14:38.026
I'LL HAVE TO
CUT THIS TREE.

14:38.128 --> 14:40.728
AND IF I DO IT JUST RIGHT,
I SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET IT TO

14:40.830 --> 14:45.466
FALL RIGHT DOWN HERE
WITHOUT DOING ANY DAMAGE.

14:46.236 --> 14:49.337
IT SHOULD MISS THE CABIN.

14:50.507 --> 14:53.675
I'LL START OFF BY JUST
CLEANING OFF THE BARK.

14:53.777 --> 14:55.476
IT'S BETTER FOR THE
SAW IF I DON'T HAVE TO CUT

14:55.579 --> 14:58.413
THROUGH THE BARK WITH IT.

14:58.782 --> 15:00.415
THIS TREE IS
GONNA BE USEFUL TO ME.

15:00.517 --> 15:02.016
I'M GONNA MAKE
FIREWOOD OUT OF IT.

15:02.118 --> 15:03.351
I'M GONNA GET
TINDER OUT OF IT.

15:03.453 --> 15:06.187
I'LL GET SOME SPRUCE PITCH
TO HELP ME START FIRES, TOO.

15:06.423 --> 15:09.591
I'LL EVEN BE ABLE TO MAKE SOME
USEFUL THINGS OUT OF THE BASE.

15:14.431 --> 15:16.030
IF I HAD A CHAINSAW,

15:16.132 --> 15:18.600
LIFE WOULD BE A
LITTLE EASIER SOMETIMES.

15:18.702 --> 15:22.136
IT ISN'T EASY CUTTING A
TREE LIKE THIS DOWN WITH AN AXE.

15:22.372 --> 15:25.373
IF I WANTED THINGS EASY,
I WOULDN'T BE LIVING OUT HERE.

15:25.875 --> 15:28.776
I'M NOT AGAINST TECHNOLOGY,
BUT I JUST USE WHAT I LIKE.

15:29.079 --> 15:30.812
I DON'T WANNA
GET TOO COMPLICATED.

15:30.914 --> 15:32.380
YOU ONLY LIVE ONCE, YOU
DON'T WANNA SPEND ALL YOUR

15:32.482 --> 15:35.483
TIME DISTRACTED WITH
YOUR MATERIAL STUFF.

15:36.486 --> 15:38.386
THIS AXE IS HELPING
ME TO SIGHT THE DIRECTION

15:38.488 --> 15:40.388
THIS TREE IS
LIKELY TO GO.

15:40.490 --> 15:44.325
IF I GET THE NOTCH JUST
RIGHT, IT'LL MISS MY CABIN.

15:44.427 --> 15:46.094
THE NEXT STEP
IS THE BACK CUT.

15:46.196 --> 15:50.298
I'VE GOT TO CUT BACK IN FROM
THE OTHER SIDE WITH MY BOW SAW.

15:53.436 --> 15:55.670
IF I DON'T LEAVE A THICK
ENOUGH HINGE OR IF I DON'T PUT

15:55.772 --> 15:58.840
THE HINGE IN THE RIGHT PLACE,
THINGS COULD GO BADLY WRONG.

16:01.277 --> 16:03.111
BECAUSE OF THE WAY
THIS TREE'S LEANING,

16:03.213 --> 16:06.314
IT IS GOING TO FALL IN THE
GENERAL DIRECTION OF MY CABIN.

16:06.416 --> 16:08.016
I'VE GOT NO
CHOICE ABOUT THAT.

16:08.118 --> 16:13.454
BUT MY GOAL HERE IS TO GET IT
TO FALL JUST OFF TO THE SIDE.

16:14.658 --> 16:16.991
AW, I DON'T LIKE
THIS TWISTED GRAIN.

16:17.093 --> 16:19.093
IT'S MAKING MY SAW
VEER OFF A LITTLE BIT.

16:19.195 --> 16:21.729
IT'S NOT MAKING A
STRAIGHT CUT LIKE I'D LIKE.

16:27.003 --> 16:31.739
WHOA, STARTING TO GO, STARTING
TO GO JUST A LITTLE MORE.

16:39.716 --> 16:41.416
HERE IT GOES,

16:43.119 --> 16:46.521
HERE IT GOES,
HERE IT GOES, OH!

16:48.491 --> 16:52.026
GLENN VILLENEUVE: HERE
IT GOES, HERE IT GOES,

16:53.963 --> 16:56.330
HERE IT GOES!

16:56.633 --> 17:00.535
OH, OH, NO.

17:01.137 --> 17:04.806
DAMN, IT GOT
HUNG UP, WHEW.

17:06.109 --> 17:09.076
IT DIDN'T QUITE CLEAR IT.

17:09.179 --> 17:11.946
IT'S STUCK RIGHT ON THE
TOP OF THIS OTHER SPRUCE TREE,

17:12.048 --> 17:13.414
THAT'S NOT GOOD.

17:13.516 --> 17:15.817
I JUST DON'T WANNA
GET TOO CLOSE TO IT,

17:15.919 --> 17:17.185
'CAUSE IF IT DOES
COME DOWN SUDDENLY,

17:17.287 --> 17:19.086
THE BUTT COULD KICK OUT,

17:19.189 --> 17:21.556
START SEEING EXACTLY
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN NOW.

17:21.658 --> 17:24.892
I OBVIOUSLY CAN'T
GET UNDERNEATH OF IT.

17:24.994 --> 17:27.562
AH, THIS IS A PROBLEM.

17:28.398 --> 17:30.865
I GOT TO FIGURE
OUT HOW TO GET THIS TREE DOWN

17:30.967 --> 17:31.833
WITHOUT GETTING HURT.

17:31.935 --> 17:33.768
I GOT TO DO IT SAFELY.

17:33.870 --> 17:35.736
IT'S STILL GOT A GOOD
HINGE THERE HOLDING IT

17:35.839 --> 17:38.573
TO THE BUTT AT THE MOMENT.

17:38.675 --> 17:42.910
IF I CAN GET A ROPE
AROUND IT UP PRETTY HIGH,

17:43.012 --> 17:46.848
THAT MIGHT BE ENOUGH.

17:47.217 --> 17:49.584
I'LL HAVE TO TRY AND GET A
ROPE AROUND IT AND PULL IT OUT

17:49.686 --> 17:50.918
OF THIS OTHER TREE.

17:51.020 --> 17:54.789
PROBLEM IS, I'VE GOT TO GET
THE ROPE UP AS HIGH AS I CAN

17:54.891 --> 17:58.226
SO THAT I HAVE ENOUGH
LEVERAGE TO PULL THIS TREE

17:58.328 --> 18:02.230
OUT OF THE OTHER TREE.

18:04.033 --> 18:06.901
I NEED SOME ROCKS.

18:13.977 --> 18:16.110
GOT SOME ROCKS IN MY SOCK.

18:16.212 --> 18:19.714
GOT A PIECE OF STRING.

18:19.816 --> 18:23.084
NOW, GOT TO FIND A
GOOD PLACE TO THROW FROM.

18:32.495 --> 18:35.563
OH, MISSED.

18:35.865 --> 18:39.734
ONE, TWO, THREE!

18:40.937 --> 18:42.503
COME ON, OH!

18:42.605 --> 18:44.071
DIDN'T QUITE MAKE IT.

18:44.173 --> 18:48.109
ONE, TWO, THREE.

18:49.579 --> 18:52.847
YES, IT MADE IT, AWESOME!

18:52.949 --> 18:56.350
NOW I JUST NEED TO
PULL THE ROPE UP.

18:56.819 --> 18:59.720
THERE, I GOT IT, ALL RIGHT.

18:59.822 --> 19:01.589
I GOT MY ROPE UP THERE.

19:01.691 --> 19:04.425
GOT TO SEE IF I
CAN GET THIS TREE DOWN.

19:05.762 --> 19:11.966
COME ON, LET'S GO,
COME ON, COME ON.

19:13.036 --> 19:16.037
<i>[GRUNTING]</i>

19:17.040 --> 19:19.340
AW, IT'S REALLY STUCK.

19:19.442 --> 19:20.608
OH, I GOT TO DO
SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

19:20.710 --> 19:22.977
THIS ISN'T WORKING.

19:23.079 --> 19:25.546
I'M GONNA TRY
A PLAN B HERE.

19:25.648 --> 19:27.682
HERE I'LL PUT
THIS THROUGH HERE.

19:27.784 --> 19:30.217
THERE,
MY NEXT ATTEMPT,

19:30.320 --> 19:33.354
I'M GONNA TRY TO GET A
LITTLE EXTRA LEVERAGE.

19:34.257 --> 19:38.793
IT'S LIKE A REALLY CRUDE
BLOCK-AND-TACKLE TYPE OF SYSTEM.

19:38.995 --> 19:42.463
GIVES ME A LITTLE BIT
OF MECHANICAL ADVANTAGE.

19:42.565 --> 19:45.099
I MIGHT BE ABLE TO
DISLODGE THE TREE NOW.

19:45.201 --> 19:46.133
I'LL GIVE IT A TRY.

19:46.235 --> 19:49.236
I'M NOT SURE IF
THIS IS GONNA WORK.

19:53.743 --> 19:55.443
COME ON,

20:06.089 --> 20:12.360
¶ ¶

20:20.069 --> 20:21.369
IT'S GOING!

20:27.510 --> 20:28.542
IT'S DOWN!

20:28.644 --> 20:33.147
YES, WHOO, WOW, IT
WORKED I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

20:33.249 --> 20:35.216
WHEW, THAT WAS HARD.

20:35.318 --> 20:37.952
THAT WAS NOT EASY.

20:38.821 --> 20:41.288
I COULD CUT UP ALL
THIS FOR FIREWOOD.

20:41.391 --> 20:42.323
THIS IS AWESOME.

20:42.425 --> 20:44.325
LOOK, THERE'S EVEN
SOME SPRUCE PITCH.

20:44.427 --> 20:45.693
THAT'S GOOD
FOR FIRE STARTER.

20:45.795 --> 20:47.695
I GOT ALL KINDS OF STUFF
OUT OF THIS TREE AND IT'S NOT

20:47.797 --> 20:50.064
THREATENING ME ANYMORE.

20:50.166 --> 20:53.367
WHEW, I GOT
IT DOWN, AWESOME.

21:01.744 --> 21:04.178
AGNES HAILSTONE: I JUST
LOVE HUNTING, GATHERING,

21:04.280 --> 21:05.579
PICKING BERRIES.

21:05.681 --> 21:07.915
AND JUST BEING
OUT IN THE COUNTRY.

21:12.922 --> 21:14.688
YESTERDAY, WE WENT ALL
THE WAY UP THERE AND LOOKED

21:14.791 --> 21:17.792
ALL AROUND AND WE ONLY
SAW COWS AND CALVES SO TODAY,

21:17.894 --> 21:20.461
WE'RE GONNA GO DOWNRIVER
AND GO CHECK FOR BULLS.

21:20.763 --> 21:22.797
EVERYBODY ELSE IN THE
VILLAGE DOES THE SAME THING.

21:22.899 --> 21:25.900
WE GO OUT AND GO GET FIVE,
SIX CARIBOU AND WE HOLD 'EM AND

21:26.002 --> 21:28.002
KEEP 'EM FOR WINTER AND
THAT'S WHAT WE RELY ON,

21:28.104 --> 21:30.037
THE FAT CARIBOU.

21:39.215 --> 21:45.052
¶ ¶

21:49.225 --> 21:51.225
WE SHOULD TRY TO STOP FOR
A WHILE AND SEE IF THERE,

21:51.327 --> 21:54.261
WE COULD GO UP AND LOOK
AROUND WITH BINOCULARS.

21:54.363 --> 21:57.731
THERE MIGHT BE CARIBOU ON
THE OTHER SIDE OR SOMETHING.

21:57.967 --> 21:59.633
PERFECT SPOT.

22:07.310 --> 22:09.243
SEE ANYTHING?

22:16.085 --> 22:18.919
LOOK, IT'S A SEAL.

22:21.457 --> 22:24.925
THERE'S A SEAL RIGHT DOWN
HERE AND IT'S NOT EVEN SPOOKED,

22:25.161 --> 22:28.462
IT'S JUST WONDERING WHAT
WE'RE DOING, SO, UM,

22:28.564 --> 22:31.632
LET'S SEE IF
IT COMES BACK UP.

22:33.836 --> 22:37.304
IF IT COME CLOSER, WE CAN TRY
SEE IF WE CAN CATCH IT SO, UM.

22:37.507 --> 22:39.006
TINMIAQ HAILSTONE: OKAY,
ALL THE CARIBOU ARE BEHIND US

22:39.108 --> 22:40.074
RIGHT THERE, YOU SEE?

22:40.176 --> 22:41.475
AGNES HAILSTONE:
OH, MY GOODNESS.

22:41.577 --> 22:42.843
TINMIAQ HAILSTONE:
RIGHT THERE.

22:42.945 --> 22:43.978
AGNES HAILSTONE:
OH MY GOODNESS,

22:44.080 --> 22:45.212
AND THE CARIBOU
ARE BEHIND US.

22:45.314 --> 22:46.847
TINMIAQ HAILSTONE: YOU
CAN SEE ALL OF THEM.

22:46.949 --> 22:50.084
AGNES HAILSTONE: I CAN SEE
THEM NOW, OH, MY GOODNESS.

22:50.953 --> 22:52.653
SO THE CARIBOU ARE
CROSSING RIGHT HERE,

22:52.755 --> 22:54.555
SO WE'RE JUST GONNA SIT TIGHT
HERE FOR A LITTLE BIT AND SEE

22:54.657 --> 22:57.491
WHAT'S GOING ON 'CAUSE, UM,
THERE ARE SEALS IN THE RIVER

22:57.593 --> 22:59.660
AND THERE'S CARIBOU
BACK HERE AND HOPEFULLY,

22:59.762 --> 23:01.262
THERE'LL BE
MORE BULLS CROSSING.

23:01.364 --> 23:04.431
SO WE'RE JUST GONNA SIT
RIGHT HERE AND WAIT FOR A WHILE.

23:05.034 --> 23:07.668
THIS IS CALLED, UM, ITCHOK,
WHEN YOU SIT DOWN AND YOU WAIT

23:07.770 --> 23:09.537
FOR SOMETHING TO COME TO YOU.

23:09.639 --> 23:11.372
BUT, UM, IF THEY
DON'T START COMING,

23:11.474 --> 23:13.908
WE CAN JUST KEEP GOING
DOWNRIVER AND HOPEFULLY BUMP

23:14.010 --> 23:15.709
INTO A BUNCH.

23:21.551 --> 23:23.951
<i>NARRATOR: THE HAILSTONES HAVE</i>
<i>WAITED UNSUCCESSFULLY FOR A</i>

23:24.053 --> 23:26.420
<i>HERD OF CARIBOU</i>
<i>TO CROSS THEIR PATH.</i>

23:26.522 --> 23:28.789
<i>WITH LIMITED TIME</i>
<i>BEFORE MIGRATION ENDS,</i>

23:28.891 --> 23:31.292
<i>THEY MUST NOW HEAD DOWNRIVER</i>
<i>TO INCREASE THEIR CHANCES OF</i>

23:31.394 --> 23:33.694
<i>INTERCEPTING A BULL CARIBOU.</i>

23:33.930 --> 23:35.529
AGNES HAILSTONE: HOPEFULLY,
THERE'S SOME CROSSING OVER

23:35.631 --> 23:38.632
THERE, WE STILL GOT
CHANCE TO GO LOOK, STILL EARLY.

23:42.538 --> 23:44.471
JUST GOT TO KEEP ON
LOOKING FOR THE CARIBOU.

23:44.574 --> 23:45.973
WE DON'T REALLY
KNOW WHERE THEY ARE,

23:46.075 --> 23:48.542
THEY'RE NOT JUST GONNA
FALL RIGHT INTO OUR BOAT.

23:51.214 --> 23:53.214
GIRLS LOOK, IT'S A MOOSE.

23:53.849 --> 23:57.151
TINMIAQ HAILSTONE: THAT'S
A BIG ASS MOOSE EH, MOM?

23:57.253 --> 23:59.520
AGNES HAILSTONE: IT'S
NOT EVEN AFRAID OF US.

24:03.759 --> 24:04.892
OKAY, YOU GUYS READY?

24:04.994 --> 24:06.894
HOPEFULLY, WE'LL
COME ACROSS A HERD.

24:06.996 --> 24:09.430
WE GOT LONG WAYS TO
GET BACK TO NOORVIK.

24:09.899 --> 24:13.267
WE'VE DRIVEN MILES AND
WE'VE BEEN UPRIVER, DOWNRIVER,

24:13.369 --> 24:15.636
ON THE BACK TRAILS.

24:15.738 --> 24:17.338
I'M NOT QUITE SURE
WHERE THE CARIBOU WERE AT.

24:17.440 --> 24:19.807
THE RUT IS ABOUT HERE, WE'RE
REALLY CLOSE TO THE END OF THE

24:19.909 --> 24:22.142
SEASON FOR TRYING TO
CATCH THESE BULL CARIBOU.

24:22.445 --> 24:24.044
SO WE'RE JUST
GONNA KEEP TRYING UNTIL

24:24.146 --> 24:25.879
THEY'RE ACTUALLY IN RUT.

24:25.982 --> 24:28.949
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
TRY THIS AGAIN TOMORROW.

24:33.589 --> 24:35.022
JESSIE HOLMES: I
DON'T DO ANYTHING OUT OF

24:35.124 --> 24:36.190
IDEALISM ANYMORE.

24:36.292 --> 24:37.458
AS I'M GETTING
OLDER OUT HERE,

24:37.560 --> 24:39.526
I DO IT OUT
OF PRACTICALITY.

24:49.639 --> 24:51.705
RIGHT NOW, THE ICE
IS COMING DOWN THE RIVER,

24:51.807 --> 24:55.075
AND CHANCES ARE, IT'S JUST
GONNA GET THICKER QUICK AND

24:55.177 --> 24:57.411
I COULD SPEND A DAY OR
TWO WORKING ON THIS MOTOR

24:57.513 --> 24:59.113
OR I COULD SPEND A
DAY OR TWO GETTING FISH,

24:59.215 --> 25:03.317
SO SPEND A DAY WORKING ON THIS,
THAT'S 1,000, 1,500 FISH THAT

25:03.419 --> 25:04.518
ARE GONNA GO BY.

25:04.620 --> 25:06.320
I CAN'T AFFORD
THAT AT THIS POINT.

25:06.422 --> 25:09.790
CALLED UP MY FRIEND,
GONNA LET ME USE HIS BOAT.

25:10.026 --> 25:11.959
I'M GONNA GO AND
GRAB HIS BOAT RIGHT NOW AND

25:12.061 --> 25:14.528
GO START THE WHEEL.

25:14.830 --> 25:17.464
THANK GOD I
LIVE IN A COMMUNITY.

25:17.566 --> 25:18.932
NOW IT'S TIME TO GO
DOWN TO THE FISH WHEEL.

25:19.035 --> 25:20.834
IT'S RIGHT DOWN
HERE, OFF THIS ISLAND.

25:20.936 --> 25:23.003
IT'S A PRETTY SHORT COMMUTE,
BUT WITHOUT A BOAT MOTOR,

25:23.105 --> 25:24.371
IT'S JUST NOT POSSIBLE.

25:24.473 --> 25:26.440
USUALLY, I'VE ALREADY
GOT MY FISH PUT UP BY NOW.

25:26.542 --> 25:28.842
I ONLY HAVE
100, 150 FISH.

25:28.944 --> 25:30.844
THAT'S NOT GONNA
LAST LONG FOR MY DOGS.

25:30.946 --> 25:32.646
RIGHT NOW, THE
FISH ARE STILL RUNNING,

25:32.748 --> 25:35.382
SO IF I DON'T GET OUT THERE
AND GET THESE FISH WITHIN THE

25:35.484 --> 25:38.218
NEXT FEW DAYS, I'M GONNA MISS
OUT ON A HUGE OPPORTUNITY AND

25:38.321 --> 25:40.854
THAT'S GONNA BE A HUGE
FINANCIAL BURDEN TO MY KENNEL.

25:42.992 --> 25:45.526
CRITICAL TO ME
TO GET THESE FISH.

25:48.197 --> 25:50.097
GOT TO BE CAREFUL WHEN
YOU'RE WALKING ACROSS HERE.

25:50.199 --> 25:51.632
THERE'S A LOT OF ICE.

25:51.734 --> 25:52.966
A LOT OF
CURRENT IN THE RIVER.

25:53.069 --> 25:55.269
IF YOU FALL IN THERE,
IT'S NOT GONNA BE GOOD.

25:56.472 --> 25:58.305
YOU GOT TO BE CONSTANTLY
THINKING ABOUT SAFETY WHEN

25:58.407 --> 25:59.707
YOU'RE ON A FISH WHEEL.

25:59.809 --> 26:01.141
YOU CAN GET HIT IN
THE HEAD BY SOMETHING,

26:01.243 --> 26:03.677
YOU FALL IN THE WATER, YOU'RE
KNOCKED OUT, YOU'RE DONE FOR.

26:03.779 --> 26:06.780
THIS WATER IS SO COLD,
THE CURRENT'S SO STRONG.

26:06.882 --> 26:09.950
NOBODY REALLY WANTS TO BE
ON THE RIVER THIS TIME OF YEAR,

26:10.052 --> 26:12.319
DEALING WITH COLD
TEMPERATURES, ICE,

26:12.421 --> 26:14.321
EVERYTHING GETS A
LITTLE MORE DIFFICULT.

26:14.857 --> 26:17.624
BUT ME, I DON'T
HAVE A CHOICE RIGHT NOW.

26:18.961 --> 26:21.261
ALL RIGHT. SO NOW,
I UNTIE THIS AND THE WHEEL

26:21.364 --> 26:23.530
WILL START TURNING.

26:24.200 --> 26:25.799
THERE IT GOES.

26:25.901 --> 26:28.235
START CATCHING FISH.

26:33.843 --> 26:36.009
THERE'S A FISH
RIGHT AWAY, FIRST SCOOP.

26:38.080 --> 26:41.749
THIS IS A GOOD SIGN,
DO I EVER NEED THIS FISH.

26:50.426 --> 26:51.825
SO THIS IS HOW
THIS WHEEL WORKS.

26:51.927 --> 26:54.261
THE FISH ARE SWIMMING
UP ALONG THIS GRAVEL BANK.

26:54.363 --> 26:57.364
THE FISH HIT IT THEN
THEY TRY TO SHOOT INTO HERE,

26:57.466 --> 26:59.933
AND THEY GET SCOOPED UP.

27:01.370 --> 27:04.705
TAKES A LONG TIME TO BUILD
BUT IT PAYS OFF BIG TIME BY

27:04.807 --> 27:06.740
CATCHING LOTS OF FISH.

27:12.014 --> 27:13.380
THERE'S ANOTHER
ONE RIGHT THERE,

27:13.482 --> 27:16.216
IT'S REALLY CATCHING
NOW, IT'S PICKING UP.

27:16.719 --> 27:20.154
SO ALL THESE GOOD NAILS HERE,
I'M GONNA FILL UP A NICE TOTE.

27:21.257 --> 27:23.190
WITH TIME RUNNING
OUT I'M PRETTY NERVOUS,

27:23.292 --> 27:24.725
BUT I'M ECSTATIC NOW.

27:24.827 --> 27:27.394
I'M PUTTING UP GOOD
AMOUNT OF FISH FOR THE DOGS.

27:31.434 --> 27:32.900
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

27:33.002 --> 27:34.301
THIS THING HAS KICKED OUT.

27:34.403 --> 27:36.737
IT'S BENDING THE
(BLEEP) UP RIGHT OVER.

27:44.280 --> 27:45.946
(BLEEP)!

27:48.985 --> 27:53.655
JESSIE HOLMES: (BLEEP),
HAVE TO BEAT THAT ICE OFF.

27:56.793 --> 27:58.993
<i>NARRATOR: JESSIE MUST HARVEST</i>
<i>FALL CHUM SALMON BEFORE THE</i>

27:59.095 --> 28:03.031
<i>RIVER FREEZES TO ENSURE HE HAS</i>
<i>ENOUGH MEAT FOR HIS SLED DOGS</i>

28:03.133 --> 28:05.200
<i>FOR THE WINTER RACING SEASON.</i>

28:05.302 --> 28:07.735
<i>BUT ICE ON THE FISH</i>
<i>WHEEL HAS CAUSED IT TO STOP,</i>

28:07.971 --> 28:10.605
<i>AND GETTING THE WHEEL</i>
<i>OPERATIONAL IS CRITICAL.</i>

28:10.707 --> 28:12.273
JESSIE HOLMES: I GOT TO STOP,
MAKE SURE I GET ALL THE ICE

28:12.375 --> 28:16.544
OFF 'CAUSE IT'S JUST GONNA
BUILD UP MORE AND CAN'T ALLOW

28:16.646 --> 28:19.113
THAT TO HAPPEN 'CAUSE THAT
JUST PUTS A LOT OF WEIGHT AND

28:19.216 --> 28:22.550
STRAIN ON THE WHEEL.

28:23.220 --> 28:25.253
THERE'S NOTHING THAT'S
NOT TIME-CONSUMING ABOUT

28:25.355 --> 28:26.421
THE FISH WHEEL.

28:26.556 --> 28:28.857
YOU GOT TO DO THINGS RIGHT
OR THINGS WILL FALL APART.

28:29.292 --> 28:31.059
SO, THIS BEING
MY BUDDY'S WHEEL,

28:31.161 --> 28:34.295
I'M GONNA TAKE
EXTRA GOOD CARE OF IT,

28:34.397 --> 28:36.497
IT'S PART OF THE DEAL.

28:42.839 --> 28:46.608
OKAY, WE'RE IN WAY
BETTER SHAPE, THANK GOD,

28:46.977 --> 28:50.545
PRAISE THE LORD,
OH MY GOD, DUDE, UNREAL.

28:51.615 --> 28:52.447
WHAT?

28:52.549 --> 28:54.816
[LAUGHS].

28:54.918 --> 28:55.850
THIS IS GREAT.

28:55.952 --> 28:58.620
THIS IS GONNA
FEED THE DOGS.

28:59.422 --> 29:00.722
FISH WHEEL
IS DOING GOOD.

29:00.824 --> 29:02.757
I'M GLAD TO SEE THIS
THING CATCHING SO GOOD.

29:02.859 --> 29:03.925
I'M ECSTATIC.

29:04.027 --> 29:06.227
THIS IS WHAT I HAD TO DO
TO MAKE IT HAPPEN AND ANOTHER

29:06.329 --> 29:09.430
YEAR I'M NOT GONNA GO
WITHOUT MY FISH, IT LOOKS LIKE.

29:10.934 --> 29:12.233
I'M GONNA HEAD
BACK TO THE HOUSE NOW.

29:12.335 --> 29:13.668
I GOT THIS
THING EMPTIED OUT

29:13.770 --> 29:15.904
AND I'M GONNA
START CUTTING FISH.

29:16.006 --> 29:18.106
FEEDING THESE DOGS
RIGHT NOW, THIS FISH,

29:18.208 --> 29:20.174
I JUST FEEL SO GRATEFUL.

29:20.277 --> 29:24.812
AND THAT I ALSO FEEL HUMBLED
BY THE EXPERIENCE OF HAVING TO

29:24.915 --> 29:27.448
RELY ON OTHERS TO HELP ME.

29:28.585 --> 29:31.252
THIS WHEEL IS GONNA PROVIDE
FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO LIVE MY

29:31.354 --> 29:34.188
DREAMS AS A MUSHER
AGAIN YET ANOTHER YEAR.

29:39.896 --> 29:43.431
SUE AIKENS: I FEEL LIKE
LIFE HANDS ME OPPORTUNITIES AND

29:43.533 --> 29:45.633
YOU GRAB IT BY THE HORNS
AND TAKE IT OR YOU SCOOT

29:45.735 --> 29:48.937
OUT OF THE WAY SO YOU
DON'T GET RUN OVER BY IT.

29:58.581 --> 30:03.551
¶ ¶

30:04.621 --> 30:08.256
GET GOING TO THE REFUGE.

30:08.491 --> 30:10.992
<i>NARRATOR: WITH HER CLIENT</i>
<i>SEASON ENDING AND HER WINTER</i>

30:11.094 --> 30:15.363

30:27.978 --> 30:30.345
<i>IN UNKNOWN TERRITORY.</i>

30:32.315 --> 30:34.048
SUE AIKENS: YOU KNOW AS I
TAKE THIS TRIP INTO THE REFUGE,

30:34.150 --> 30:35.483
WHY DO I EVEN WANNA GO?

30:35.585 --> 30:37.452
WELL, IT'S RIGHT
THERE, NUMBER ONE.

30:37.554 --> 30:40.021
IT IS ONE OF THE MOST
TALKED ABOUT PLACES ON THE

30:40.123 --> 30:41.022
FACE OF THE EARTH.

30:41.124 --> 30:42.290
WHY?

30:42.392 --> 30:45.793
BECAUSE IT IS A FAIRLY
PRISTINE CHUNK OF REAL ESTATE

30:45.895 --> 30:47.161
ON THIS PLANET.

30:47.263 --> 30:50.365
THE ANIMALS HAVE BEEN DOING
EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE DOING FOR

30:50.467 --> 30:52.467
HUNDREDS OF
THOUSANDS OF YEARS.

30:52.569 --> 30:54.435
THOSE ROCKS HAVE
LAID THERE UNDISTURBED

30:54.537 --> 30:56.904
FOR MILLIONS OF YEARS.

30:57.007 --> 30:59.841
WHY WOULD YOU NOT
WANNA GO CHECK IT OUT?

31:05.015 --> 31:07.148
BOY, I CAN SEE
WHY THE GEOLOGISTS REALLY

31:07.250 --> 31:08.549
LIKE THIS AREA.

31:08.651 --> 31:09.984
PILOT: I KNOW.

31:10.086 --> 31:12.687
SUE AIKENS:
GOT SO MANY FOLDS.

31:14.691 --> 31:16.924
OOH, I WONDER IF
THERE'S FISHIES THERE?

31:17.761 --> 31:20.061
THEY'VE STILL
GOT LIQUID WATER.

31:20.163 --> 31:22.697
KAVIK MIGHT GET A LITTLE
SNOW, BUT HERE, IT SAYS NO,

31:22.799 --> 31:25.466
JUST DROPPING
TEMPERATURES AND CLEAR.

31:34.811 --> 31:40.882
¶ ¶

31:45.155 --> 31:49.924
AWESOME,
LOOKS BEAUTIFUL.

31:52.996 --> 31:54.562
WHENEVER YOU
LAND IN THE WINTER,

31:54.664 --> 31:56.030
TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE.

31:56.132 --> 31:59.500
YOU GOT TO GET IT
UNLOADED AND GET HIM ON HIS WAY.

32:02.305 --> 32:05.473
HEARING THAT PLANE GET
SOFTER IN THE DISTANCE.

32:05.575 --> 32:08.643
THAT REALLY LETS ME KNOW
THAT I'VE HIT THE BULL'S-EYE.

32:08.745 --> 32:11.079
I LIKE BEING ALONE,
I LIKE MY SOLITUDE,

32:11.181 --> 32:14.916
AND I
CERTAINLY HAVE IT NOW.

32:20.356 --> 32:21.589
GLENN VILLENEUVE:
LEARNING'S IMPORTANT,

32:21.691 --> 32:23.624
BUT UN-LEARNING
IS IMPORTANT, TOO.

32:23.726 --> 32:25.860
WE LEARN SO MUCH STUFF
THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE,

32:25.962 --> 32:28.162
YOU GOT TO SPEND A
LOT OF TIME UN-LEARNING IT.

32:37.974 --> 32:42.610
¶ ¶

32:42.712 --> 32:44.512
NOW, I'LL BE ABLE
TO USE THIS WOOD.

32:44.614 --> 32:47.515
THIS TIME OF YEAR, I'M
ALWAYS LOOKING FOR FIREWOOD.

32:48.284 --> 32:50.151
IT'S GETTING A LOT COLDER.

32:50.253 --> 32:53.154
PRETTY SOON, WINTER'S
GONNA REALLY SET IN.

32:53.256 --> 32:55.523
I'VE GOT TO
HAVE PLENTY OF WOOD.

32:55.758 --> 32:58.359
THERE, GOT IT, NICE.

32:59.362 --> 33:01.929
GOT THE FIRST
SECTION CUT IN TWO.

33:02.031 --> 33:03.898
THAT'S GOOD.

33:04.701 --> 33:06.834
I GOT A LOT OF
USEFUL WOOD HERE.

33:06.936 --> 33:09.203
FIREWOOD AND I'VE GOT
SOME OTHER MATERIAL HERE, TOO.

33:09.305 --> 33:11.405
THIS IS REAL
SPIRAL GRAIN WOOD.

33:11.508 --> 33:13.374
IT'S A PAIN IN THE
BUTT TO SAW THROUGH,

33:13.476 --> 33:15.943
BUT IT WILL HOLD UP REAL
WELL AS A SPLITTING BLOCK.

33:16.546 --> 33:18.079
THERE,

33:24.654 --> 33:28.055
THERE, THAT ONE TREE IS
GONNA GIVE ME A LOT OF FIREWOOD.

33:28.791 --> 33:31.292
IT'S GONNA GIVE ME PLENTY
OF TWIGS TO START MY FIRES,

33:31.561 --> 33:33.561
AND THE BEST PART, I DON'T
HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT WHAT MIGHT

33:33.663 --> 33:37.465
HAPPEN IF THE WIND COMES
UP AND BLOWS THAT TREE OVER.

33:47.610 --> 33:50.044
AGNES HAILSTONE: SUCCESSFUL
HUNTING TAKES PATIENCE AND

33:50.146 --> 33:52.113
NEVER GIVING UP.

33:57.820 --> 33:59.987
<i>NARRATOR: IN NOORVIK, THE</i>
<i>HAILSTONES ARE HUNTING BULL</i>

34:00.089 --> 34:02.890
<i>CARIBOU AS THEY MIGRATE</i>
<i>THROUGH THE REGION.</i>

34:02.992 --> 34:04.926
<i>THE ANIMALS PROVIDE</i>
<i>MEAT AND FUR TO SURVIVE</i>

34:05.028 --> 34:06.294
<i>THE MONTHS AHEAD,</i>

34:06.396 --> 34:08.996
<i>BUT WITH THE WINDOW TO</i>
<i>HARVEST THEM CLOSING QUICKLY,</i>

34:09.098 --> 34:11.832
<i>DESPERATION FOR AGNES</i>
<i>AND THE GIRLS IS GROWING.</i>

34:12.869 --> 34:14.936
AGNES HAILSTONE: WE JUST
MADE IT TO OUR CAMPING SPOT.

34:15.038 --> 34:17.638
WE USUALLY COME TO THIS
SPOT EVERY YEAR AND, UM,

34:17.740 --> 34:20.575
WE'RE ALL BEHIND THE WILLOWS
AND THE CARIBOUS CAN'T SEE US

34:20.677 --> 34:21.842
WHEN THEY CROSS.

34:21.945 --> 34:23.978
WE'RE ABLE TO DO THE
HUNTING WE DO AND TRY TO GET

34:24.080 --> 34:26.514
AS MUCH AS WE CAN AND
TRY TO HOPEFULLY GET BULLS.

34:26.616 --> 34:28.249
BUT FOR RIGHT NOW,
WE'RE GONNA GO SET UP OUR

34:28.351 --> 34:30.718
TENT WHILE
NOTHING'S CROSSING.

34:48.037 --> 34:51.572
ONE, TWO, THREE;
THERE'S THREE OF THEM.

34:52.308 --> 34:53.374
TINMIAQ HAILSTONE:
THREE BULLS?

34:53.509 --> 34:55.776
AGNES HAILSTONE: ONE IN
THE FRONT, TWO IN THE BACK.

34:55.878 --> 34:57.511
WE HAVE TO GET
INTO THE BOAT NOW,

34:57.614 --> 34:59.747
WE HAVE TO SLOWLY
GET INTO THE BOAT.

34:59.849 --> 35:01.716
NO FAST
MOVEMENTS, EVERYBODY.

35:01.985 --> 35:03.784
CAROL, CAROL!

35:04.120 --> 35:07.121
TINMIAQ HAILSTONE: TAKE OUT
THE CLIP, CAROL AND RELOAD IT.

35:08.057 --> 35:10.291
AGNES HAILSTONE: THIS
IS IT, GIRLS, THIS IS IT.

35:22.639 --> 35:23.938
TINMIAQ HAILSTONE: IN
THE BACK OF THE HEAD.

35:24.040 --> 35:26.173
CAREFUL WHERE YOU'RE
AIMING, WAIT, WAIT.

35:26.276 --> 35:27.942
QUTAN HAILSTONE:
THAT ONE RIGHT THERE?

35:28.044 --> 35:30.878
TINMIAQ HAILSTONE:
YUP, OOH, RELOAD, RELOAD.

35:30.980 --> 35:32.980
AGNES HAILSTONE: ONE MORE TIME
IN THE MIDDLE, THE MIDDLE ONE,

35:33.082 --> 35:35.583
THE MIDDLE ONE IS THE ONE YOU
SHOT, GO ON AHEAD, TRY AGAIN.

35:36.819 --> 35:38.886
ONE MORE, PRINCESS,
RIGHT IN THE BACK OF THE HEAD.

35:40.690 --> 35:42.823
ONE MORE TIME,
SWEETHEART, YOU GOT THIS!

35:44.560 --> 35:46.861
THERE YOU GO, YOU
GOT IT, SWEETHEART.

35:48.531 --> 35:52.833
WE JUST NEED TO TIE IT TO
THE BOAT AND THAT'S OUR KILL.

35:55.038 --> 35:56.904
WE HAD AN
OPPORTUNITY TO CATCH MORE,

35:57.006 --> 36:00.308
BUT WE HAD A YOUNG SHOOTER
AND I'M REAL HAPPY THAT SHE

36:00.410 --> 36:03.811
GOT HER FIRST KILL AND THIS
IS JUST SO EXCITING AND NOW SHE

36:03.913 --> 36:06.647
KNOWS THE FEELING OF EVERY
TIME WE START TALKING ABOUT

36:06.749 --> 36:08.015
THESE STORIES
COMING UP HERE,

36:08.117 --> 36:11.319
SHE KNOWS EXACTLY
WHAT WE'RE DOING.

36:11.421 --> 36:13.554
SHE DID A REAL GOOD JOB
AND I'M REAL HAPPY FOR HER,

36:13.656 --> 36:16.657
SO NOW, IT'S TIME TO
WORK AND ACTUALLY GET THE

36:16.759 --> 36:19.293
JOB DONE WITH THE
REST OF THE HUNT.

36:19.962 --> 36:24.165
I'M SO HAPPY,
ONE MORE KISS, YES.

36:25.468 --> 36:27.535
QUTAN HAILSTONE: IT'S MY FIRST
BULL CARIBOU OF THE YEAR AND

36:27.637 --> 36:30.104
IT WAS FUN TO HUNT
WITH MY MOM AND MY SISTER.

36:30.206 --> 36:31.772
AGNES HAILSTONE: USUALLY,
I DON'T DO THE GUTTING.

36:31.874 --> 36:34.475
I DON'T USUALLY DO THE
DRIVING EITHER, BUT THIS TIME,

36:34.577 --> 36:36.210
WE'RE JUST GONNA
HAVE TO DO IT TOGETHER.

36:36.312 --> 36:37.978
THIS IS A NEW
EXPERIENCE FOR ALL OF US

36:38.081 --> 36:39.780
BECAUSE I DON'T USUALLY GUT.

36:39.882 --> 36:42.183
TINMIAQ HAILSTONE: AND I'LL,
I'LL GUT SINCE DAD'S NOT HERE.

36:42.285 --> 36:44.652
AGNES HAILSTONE:
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

36:44.887 --> 36:47.121
SO, THIS CARIBOU HERE,
AND ALL THIS MEAT, THE SKIN,

36:47.223 --> 36:48.222
THIS IS OUR PRIZE.

36:48.324 --> 36:49.490
THIS IS OUR TROPHY.

36:49.625 --> 36:52.393
THIS IS WHAT'S GONNA START US
OFF FOR A LONG, COLD WINTER.

36:52.495 --> 36:54.328
AND I'M SO PROUD
AND HAPPY FOR MY GIRLS.

36:54.430 --> 36:57.631
THEY'RE ABLE TO COME
OUT HERE AND HUNT WITH ME.

36:57.867 --> 36:59.767
TINMIAQ HAILSTONE: CAN I EAT
A PIECE OF THIS LIVER, MOM?

36:59.869 --> 37:02.536
AGNES HAILSTONE: YEAH,
PRETTY MUCH KEEP EVERYTHING.

37:02.638 --> 37:05.406
HOPEFULLY, UM, WE CATCH A
LITTLE BIT MORE, BUT IF NOT,

37:05.508 --> 37:08.376
THIS IS A REAL GOOD
CARIBOU TO START US OFF

37:08.478 --> 37:10.044
FOR A LONG WINTER.

37:10.480 --> 37:12.813
THANK YOU, SWEETHEART.

37:15.385 --> 37:21.088
OOH, DANG, THE WHOLE
HERD IS JUST COMING STRAIGHT

37:21.190 --> 37:25.593
TOWARD US AND THEY'RE
BEING LED BY TWO PRIME BULL.

37:25.795 --> 37:27.027
TWO TAKE-ABLE BULLS.

37:27.130 --> 37:28.996
QUTAN, SINCE YOU ALREADY
GOT ONE, IT'S CAROL'S TURN.

37:29.098 --> 37:30.164
CAROL, THERE'S TWO OF 'EM.

37:30.266 --> 37:31.932
THERE'S ONE IN THE MIDDLE
AND THERE'S ONE IN THE END,

37:32.034 --> 37:34.902
WE HAVE TO GO RIGHT NOW.

37:41.477 --> 37:43.344
TO THE RIGHT.

37:43.780 --> 37:46.380
THIS IS THE ONE
WE'RE GOING FOR, CAROL.

37:46.749 --> 37:49.150
CAREFUL OF THE COW AND
THE CALF RIGHT AHEAD OF IT.

37:49.952 --> 37:51.619
YOU GOT THAT SHOT, TAKE IT.

37:53.556 --> 37:54.755
IT'S GONNA TRY TO STAY
IN THE MIDDLE OF THEM.

37:54.857 --> 37:56.390
GO AHEAD,
THAT'S A GOOD SHOT!

38:01.931 --> 38:03.197
AGNES HAILSTONE: IT'S
GONNA TRY AND STAY IN

38:03.299 --> 38:04.198
THE MIDDLE OF THEM.

38:04.300 --> 38:06.300
GO AHEAD,
THAT'S A GOOD SHOT.

38:10.239 --> 38:11.772
WAIT,
CAREFUL OF THE WAVES.

38:11.874 --> 38:16.243
GO AHEAD ANYTIME YOU'RE
READY, YOU GOT THAT ONE.

38:16.345 --> 38:17.444
THERE'S ANOTHER ONE, CAROL.

38:17.547 --> 38:19.480
LET THAT GO,
THERE'S ANOTHER HERD.

38:19.582 --> 38:21.682
CAROL HAILSTONE:
WHERE IS IT?

38:29.325 --> 38:31.725
¶ ¶

38:31.827 --> 38:35.129
AGNES HAILSTONE: THE
BULL IS SECOND TO THE LAST.

38:35.231 --> 38:36.830
YOU SEE IT, CAROL?

38:36.933 --> 38:39.833
CAROL, YOU GOT THIS.

38:40.036 --> 38:42.202
I'M GONNA CUT IT OFF
FROM THE COWS AND THE CALVES.

38:47.243 --> 38:51.979
WE GOT HIM, COOCHUK,
ONE MORE TIME, CAROL.

38:52.748 --> 38:54.315
CAROL HAILSTONE:
YOU GO FIRST, MOM.

38:54.417 --> 38:55.816
AGNES HAILSTONE: WE
HAVE TO GET A GOOD SHOT.

38:55.918 --> 38:57.051
CAROL HAILSTONE: I
CAN'T GET IT, MOM.

38:57.186 --> 39:00.421
AGNES HAILSTONE: KEEP CALM,
I'M GONNA GET TO IT, ALMOST!

39:01.691 --> 39:04.558
CAROL HAILSTONE: WE GOT IT.

39:04.794 --> 39:07.094
AGNES HAILSTONE:
THAT'S A GOOD ONE.

39:07.797 --> 39:09.597
CAROL HAILSTONE: MY
YOUNGER SISTER GOT ONE TODAY.

39:09.699 --> 39:12.600
NOW, IT WAS MY TURN TO SHOOT
AND I GOT THIS BIG BULL WITH

39:12.702 --> 39:14.768
TWO SHOTS RIGHT IN
THE BACK OF THE HEAD.

39:14.870 --> 39:17.504
THIS IS MY SECOND
BULL OF THE DAY.

39:17.940 --> 39:19.306
AGNES HAILSTONE: I'M
SO PROUD OF YOU, CAROL.

39:19.408 --> 39:22.109
YOU DID REAL GOOD, NOW,
YOU'RE A CARIBOU HUNTER.

39:22.645 --> 39:24.078
PRINCESS CARIBOU HUNTER.

39:24.180 --> 39:27.281
WAY TO GO, GIRLS, TEAMWORK,
THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT.

39:30.086 --> 39:32.453
[INAUDIBLE].

39:37.393 --> 39:39.660
WE GOT QUTAN'S,
NOW WE GOT CAROL'S,

39:39.762 --> 39:41.629
AND WE GOT
TO GUT THESE TWO.

39:41.731 --> 39:42.930
WE COULD HAVE
HEART AND TONGUE,

39:43.032 --> 39:45.499
AND THEN WE COULD PACK
UP CAMP AND HEAD HOME.

39:46.068 --> 39:48.569
WE'RE GONNA START OFF THIS
WINTER WITH SOME GOOD CHOICE

39:48.671 --> 39:50.804
PIECES OF CARIBOU MEAT.

39:51.474 --> 39:53.941
USUALLY, WE'RE OUT HERE WITH
YOUR DAD AND EVERYBODY ELSE,

39:54.043 --> 39:56.310
BUT THIS IS
KIND OF INTERESTING,

39:56.412 --> 39:59.179
TRYING TO LEARN ALL
THESE THINGS BY OURSELVES.

39:59.281 --> 40:00.914
TINMIAQ HAILSTONE: I DIDN'T
REALIZE HOW MUCH WORK DAD AND

40:01.017 --> 40:03.651
THE BOYS DO PUTTING
THESE UP AND GUTTING THEM.

40:03.753 --> 40:05.386
AGNES HAILSTONE: I'M SURE
YOUR DAD WOULD FEEL REAL PROUD,

40:05.488 --> 40:07.521
AS PROUD AS I FEEL.

40:07.623 --> 40:09.923
HERE GO, DINNER.

40:18.734 --> 40:22.436
SUE AIKENS: SOMETIMES, I
FORGET TO ENJOY THE LIFE I'M

40:22.538 --> 40:24.772
LIVING INSTEAD OF JUST
LIVING THE LIFE I'VE GOT.

40:37.820 --> 40:39.887
<i>NARRATOR: WITH HER BOOTS</i>
<i>ON THE GROUND IN THE REFUGE,</i>

40:39.989 --> 40:42.790
<i>SUE MUST LOCATE AN AREA</i>
<i>TO SET UP HER CAMP BEFORE</i>

40:42.892 --> 40:44.792
<i>THE SETTING SUN</i>
<i>LEADS TO RAPIDLY DECREASING</i>

40:44.894 --> 40:47.528
<i>TEMPERATURES</i>
<i>AND DANGEROUS CONDITIONS.</i>

40:47.730 --> 40:48.996
SUE AIKENS: IT'S A LITTLE
WINDIER THAN I THOUGHT

40:49.098 --> 40:50.230
IT WOULD BE HERE.

40:50.332 --> 40:51.999
I'VE GOT TO
GET MYSELF SET UP.

40:52.101 --> 40:54.301
I HAVE TO GET READY,
BECAUSE ALONG WITH THE

40:54.403 --> 40:56.770
TEMPERATURES DROPPING,
THE DARK IS ON ITS HEELS.

40:57.707 --> 41:00.007
WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR, I
MEAN, IN A PERFECT WORLD,

41:00.109 --> 41:03.477
I'D HAVE SOME BRUSH, YOU
KNOW, KIND OF IN A SQUARE.

41:03.579 --> 41:06.346
I DON'T WANNA BE SO FAR AWAY
FROM THE RUNWAY THAT IF I HAVE

41:06.449 --> 41:08.682
DIFFICULTIES, I'VE GOT
A LONG WAY TO GO WHEN THEY

41:08.784 --> 41:10.150
NEED TO PICK ME UP.

41:10.252 --> 41:12.319
I'VE GOT
SOMETHING TO TIE TO HERE,

41:12.421 --> 41:16.190
SOMETHING TO TIE TO THERE,
SOMETHING TO TIE TO THERE.

41:16.292 --> 41:18.092
THIS IS NOT BAD.

41:18.194 --> 41:21.562
GOT IN VERY LATE AFTERNOON.

41:22.098 --> 41:23.731
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE TO
HAVE MAYBE A LITTLE BIT MORE

41:23.833 --> 41:26.533
EYES ON THE GROUND
TIME TO PICK A SPOT,

41:26.635 --> 41:29.269
BUT I'VE GOT A COUPLE OF
BUSHES I CAN GET MYSELF, UH,

41:29.371 --> 41:30.771
TAGGED INTO.

41:30.873 --> 41:32.806
AND I'VE GOT TO
GET THE TENT UP.

41:32.908 --> 41:36.744
THIS IS GONNA BE SINGLE
DIGITS BELOW ZERO TONIGHT.

41:36.846 --> 41:39.279
SO, PARAMOUNT IS GETTING
THE TENT UP, GETTING SHELTER,

41:39.381 --> 41:41.749
GETTING HEAT
GOING INSIDE OF IT.

41:47.623 --> 41:50.023
LET ME GO SEE IF I
CAN'T FIND SOME ROCKS.

41:52.428 --> 41:55.062
OH, I JUST WANNA COLLECT A
COUPLE OF BIGGER ROCKS THAT I

41:55.164 --> 41:58.332
CAN TIE MY TENT TO.

41:59.935 --> 42:05.372
YOU CAN'T, UH, YOU CAN'T GET
MUCH MORE PEACEFUL THAN THIS.

42:06.475 --> 42:10.210
THESE COLORS, THESE SHADES,
JUST DON'T HAPPEN THAT OFTEN.

42:11.447 --> 42:13.514
I DO NOT TAKE
THAT FOR GRANTED.

42:13.616 --> 42:17.384
IN THE PALETTE OF THE
ARCTIC, YOU GET THESE PINKS,

42:17.486 --> 42:20.154
AND ORANGES, AND
PEACHES TWICE A YEAR,

42:20.656 --> 42:22.956
ONLY TWO TIMES FOR A
COUPLE OF WEEKS EACH.

42:23.058 --> 42:25.526
IN THE SPRING
AND IN THE FALL.

42:25.628 --> 42:28.996
MY BIG BACKYARD IS
PRETTY FREAKING AMAZING.

42:29.665 --> 42:32.299
THE GOAL IS TO
BE ONE WITH NATURE.

42:32.401 --> 42:36.136
I'M AT THE AGE WHERE,
I'M BEATING MY OWN BODY UP.

42:39.341 --> 42:41.775
I WANNA TRY, I
WANNA SEE, I WANNA DO.

42:43.212 --> 42:46.013
BEFORE SOMEBODY PUTS MY
BODY SIX FOOT UNDER THE GROUND,

42:46.115 --> 42:47.948
I WANNA KNOW THAT
I CLIMBED EVERY VALLEY

42:48.050 --> 42:51.618
AND LOOKED OVER
EVERY HILL, I GOT OUT HERE.

42:52.688 --> 42:54.688
THE TENT IS UP.

42:54.790 --> 42:57.191
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO
EVERYTHING THAT THIS REFUGE

42:57.293 --> 42:59.693
HAS TO OFFER.

42:59.795 --> 43:01.261
TOMORROW'S A BRAND NEW DAY.

43:05.167 --> 43:06.867
JESSIE HOLMES: AND
YOU HELP PEOPLE OUT AND

43:06.969 --> 43:08.535
THEY HELP YOU OUT.

43:08.637 --> 43:10.337
WE ALL WORK TOGETHER.

43:10.439 --> 43:12.706
I'M LUCKY TO LIVE
SOMEWHERE LIKE THIS.

43:18.347 --> 43:22.649
<i>[BARKING].</i>

43:26.789 --> 43:29.356
DOGS KNOW THAT I'M
COOKING UP THIS FISH FOR 'EM,

43:29.558 --> 43:31.091
THEY KNOW THIS COOKER.

43:31.193 --> 43:33.527
THEY SEE IT
FIRED UP EVERY DAY.

43:39.768 --> 43:40.634
THIS IS IT.

43:40.736 --> 43:43.136
THIS IS, UH,
16 FISH COOKED UP,

43:43.372 --> 43:45.973
MAKE A NICE
BROTH FOR THESE DOGS.

43:46.208 --> 43:49.042
THIS IS SOME OF THE BEST
FOOD FOR DOGS RIGHT HERE.

43:52.982 --> 43:54.681
IT'S BEEN A LOT OF
STRUGGLE TO GET THE FISH

43:54.783 --> 43:58.886
AND A LOTTA LITTLE THINGS
IN MY WAY, BUT PAID OFF,

43:59.221 --> 44:00.721
GOT FISH FOR THE DOGS.

44:00.823 --> 44:03.991
DOGS ARE HAPPY ABOUT
IT, I'M HAPPY ABOUT IT.

44:04.093 --> 44:06.326
IT WOULD HAVE FELT GREAT TO
GET THAT BOAT GOING AND DO IT

44:06.428 --> 44:08.795
WITH MY OWN BOAT, BUT,
UH, IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT.

44:08.898 --> 44:10.898
IT'S ABOUT GETTING
THE FISH FOR THE DOGS.

44:11.000 --> 44:13.433
HEY, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING YOUNGIN'?

44:13.702 --> 44:19.907
THOR, THEY NEED THE
BONES, THEY NEED THE GUTS,

44:20.009 --> 44:21.642
THEY NEED THE HEADS.

44:21.744 --> 44:23.210
IT'S A COMPLETE BALANCE.

44:23.312 --> 44:27.648
HELPS GIVE 'EM STRONG JOINTS,
GOOD COATS, GOOD TOUGH FEET.

44:30.552 --> 44:33.020
FISHING SEASON LEADS RIGHT
INTO MUSHING AND TRAINING,

44:33.122 --> 44:35.155
AND, UH, THAT'S WHEN
THE WORK REALLY BEGINS,

44:35.257 --> 44:37.824
SO I ALWAYS FEEL LIKE
FISHING HELPS ME GET READY

44:37.927 --> 44:40.260
FOR THE MUSHING SEASON.

44:47.336 --> 44:49.303
IT'S TIME TO STEP UP
AND START TRAINING HARDER,

44:49.405 --> 44:52.806
NOW THAT I GOT MY
FOOD RESERVES STACKING UP.

44:52.908 --> 44:55.142
THIS FISH IS GONNA LAST
ME THROUGH THE WHOLE WINTER.

44:59.615 --> 45:02.182
THIS RIGHT
HERE IS MY FUTURE.

45:02.851 --> 45:05.552
I'D SAY IT
LOOKS PRETTY BRIGHT.

45:11.627 --> 45:13.493
AGNES HAILSTONE: THE FUTURE
LOOKS BRIGHT FOR US, GIRLS.

45:13.595 --> 45:17.197
IF WE PUT OUR MINDS TO IT,
WE CAN DO ANYTHING TOGETHER.

45:23.472 --> 45:25.739
MM, IT SMELLS GOOD,
LIKE IT'S DONE.

45:25.841 --> 45:27.941
TINMIAQ HAILSTONE: ALL
RIGHT, SHOULD I CUT IT UP?

45:28.043 --> 45:29.142
AGNES HAILSTONE: YUP.

45:29.244 --> 45:30.243
TINMIAQ HAILSTONE:
SHOULD BE.

45:30.379 --> 45:32.713
AGNES HAILSTONE: WHOA,
IT'S BOILING JUST PERFECT.

45:32.815 --> 45:35.682
MM, CHECK THAT OUT.

45:36.585 --> 45:38.318
GLAD WE CAUGHT
SOME FRESH CARIBOU.

45:38.420 --> 45:40.921
THANK YOU, QUTAN,
THANK YOU, CAROL, THANK YOU,

45:41.023 --> 45:43.156
TING, AWESOME.

45:43.425 --> 45:46.193
FRESH AS YOU CAN GET IT,
RIGHT OUT OF THE RIVER,

45:46.295 --> 45:48.996
INTO THE BOAT, INTO THE
POT, AND INTO OUR TUMMIES.

45:50.866 --> 45:52.532
TINMIAQ HAILSTONE: NICE
HOT MEAL BEFORE WE TRAVEL.

45:52.634 --> 45:54.401
AGNES HAILSTONE: IT'S
GONNA TAKE US A FEW HOURS

45:54.503 --> 45:55.569
TO GET HOME.

45:55.704 --> 45:56.937
WHEN WE GET HOME, WE'LL
BRING 'EM, AND HANG 'EM UP,

45:57.039 --> 46:00.273
AND WE'LL BE DONE WITH
CARIBOU HUNTING, UNTIL YUP,

46:00.509 --> 46:03.477
UNTIL IT'S SAFE TO
TRAVEL AGAIN THIS WINTER.

46:04.513 --> 46:07.247
TINMIAQ HAILSTONE: CAROL, YOU
HAVE FUN SHOOTING THOSE CARIBOU?

46:08.017 --> 46:09.583
CAROL HAILSTONE: OF COURSE.

46:09.685 --> 46:11.485
EXCITING.

46:11.587 --> 46:13.653
TINMIAQ HAILSTONE:
SUPER EXCITING.

46:13.756 --> 46:16.156
THANK YOU GIRLS FOR
THE GOOD FRESH DINNER.

46:16.258 --> 46:17.758
GOOD SHOTS.

46:17.860 --> 46:20.127
AGNES HAILSTONE: MAN, IF YOUR
DAD WAS HERE EATING WITH US,

46:20.229 --> 46:21.995
HE'D BE SO
PROUD OF YOU, GIRLS.

46:22.097 --> 46:24.865
NOT EVER, HE'D BE PROUD
OF YOU ALL DAY LIKE ME.

46:25.100 --> 46:26.833
I'M STILL PROUD
OF YOU, GIRLS.

46:26.935 --> 46:28.802
REAL GOOD MEAL.

46:28.904 --> 46:30.704
TINMIAQ HAILSTONE: BUT DON'T
TELL HIM I KNOW HOW TO GUT,

46:30.806 --> 46:33.006
SO HE WON'T EXPECT ME TO.

46:33.375 --> 46:34.808
