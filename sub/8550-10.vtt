02:01.855 --> 02:05.326
HURRY UP, WINSLOW. I DON'T
LIKE TO BE KEPT WAITING.

02:05.393 --> 02:06.660
PROMISE YOU WON'T LAUGH?

02:08.262 --> 02:10.831
YOU HAVE MY WORD
AS AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN.

02:37.325 --> 02:39.927
MMM...HMM...HMM.

02:39.993 --> 02:43.264
AH HA HA HA HA!

02:43.331 --> 02:44.732
AH HA HA HA HA!

02:46.234 --> 02:48.669
YOU PROMISED ME
YOU WOULDN'T LAUGH.

02:48.736 --> 02:51.205
I HAD MY FINGERS
CROSSED, MA'AM.

02:52.940 --> 02:54.942
WHOO! OOH.

02:55.008 --> 02:57.311
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL
WHEN YOU'RE ANGRY.

02:58.746 --> 03:00.381
OKAY, THAT'S IT.

03:00.448 --> 03:03.551
AS OF NOW, I AM UN-VOLUNTEERING
FOR THIS OPERATION.

03:12.626 --> 03:15.028
FINE, WINSLOW.
YOU WANT TO BE A SERGEANT

03:15.095 --> 03:17.531
FOR THE REST
OF YOUR LIFE. THAT IT?

03:17.598 --> 03:18.566
WELL, NO--

03:18.632 --> 03:20.301
LISTEN UP.

03:20.368 --> 03:22.169
SOME LOWLIFE
MUGGED THE WIFE

03:22.236 --> 03:24.438
OF OUR BELOVED
POLICE CHIEF.

03:24.505 --> 03:26.874
NOW, IF WE CAPTURE
THAT LOWLIFE,

03:26.940 --> 03:31.812
HOW DO YOU THINK OUR BELOVED
POLICE CHIEF WILL REWARD US?

03:31.879 --> 03:33.981
WITH A PROMOTION?

03:34.047 --> 03:38.719
THAT'S THE LEAST WE CAN
EXPECT FROM THAT OLD RUMMY.

03:38.786 --> 03:40.821
WELL, LET'S GET
THIS OVER WITH.

03:47.227 --> 03:48.562
MAY I?

03:51.332 --> 03:53.501
I'LL PUT MY FACE
ON IN THE CAR.

03:56.337 --> 04:02.142
WAIT. WAIT. WAIT.

04:02.209 --> 04:09.149
ALLOW ME, BABE.

04:09.216 --> 04:11.652
DON'T YOU EVEN
THINK ABOUT IT.

04:20.394 --> 04:22.463
RACHEL?
YES, SWEETIE.

04:22.530 --> 04:24.698
HAVE YOU CHECKED OUT
THE GUY AT TABLE FOUR?

04:24.765 --> 04:28.135
6'2", TWEED JACKET,
GOLD WATCH, NO WEDDING RING,

04:28.201 --> 04:30.237
SMALL SCAR ON CHIN?

04:30.304 --> 04:31.772
THAT'S HIM.

04:31.839 --> 04:33.907
HARDLY NOTICED HIM.

04:33.974 --> 04:36.344
RIGHT. WELL, HE ASKED
TO SEE THE MANAGER.

04:36.410 --> 04:37.545
OH, NO.
WHAT'S WRONG?

04:37.611 --> 04:39.780
HE DIDN'T SAY,
BUT WHEN YOU GO OVER THERE

04:39.847 --> 04:41.982
CHECK OUT
HIS DIMPLES WHEN HE CHEWS.

04:48.756 --> 04:51.158
I'M THE MANAGER, SIR.
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

04:51.224 --> 04:52.993
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
THERE IS.

04:53.060 --> 04:55.195
I'VE GOT THIS DELICIOUS
DINNER HERE,

04:55.262 --> 04:57.831
AND I HAVE TO EAT IT
ALONE UNLESS--

04:57.898 --> 04:59.700
WOULD YOU JOIN ME?

05:03.036 --> 05:04.338
WELL...

05:04.405 --> 05:05.906
IT'S THE AFTER-SCHOOL RUSH,

05:05.973 --> 05:08.609
AND AS YOU CAN SEE
I'M REALLY VERY, VERY--

05:08.676 --> 05:09.810
SURE.

05:21.355 --> 05:23.256
VONDA MAHONEY!

05:23.323 --> 05:24.358
IN THE FLESH.

05:24.425 --> 05:26.660
AND, OH,
WHAT FLESH IT IS!

05:29.162 --> 05:31.565
WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO, EDDIE?

05:31.632 --> 05:33.501
I'M GONNA PUT
THE MOVES ON VONDA.

05:33.567 --> 05:35.068
WORD IS SHE'S FAST.

05:35.135 --> 05:38.406
I COULD BEAT HER.

05:39.640 --> 05:41.809
THOSE HIGH HEELS
WOULD SLOW HER DOWN.

05:44.011 --> 05:48.416
NO, MAN. GUYS WHO GO OUT
WITH VONDA GET INSTANT REPS.

05:48.482 --> 05:50.718
WE'D BE STUDS
INSTEAD OF WHAT WE ARE.

05:52.920 --> 05:54.287
YOU KNOW...

05:54.354 --> 05:55.689
VIRGINS?

06:09.803 --> 06:11.472
HI, VONDA.

06:11.539 --> 06:16.109
CAN I BUY YOU A SODA,
A BURGER, A MOTOR HOME?

06:16.176 --> 06:18.011
THAT'S A GREAT LINE.
THANKS.

06:18.078 --> 06:19.713
NOW GO AWAY.

06:22.282 --> 06:23.717
WHY? WHAT'S WRONG?

06:23.784 --> 06:26.153
I GOT A "D" ON
MY ALGEBRA TEST THIS MORNING

06:26.219 --> 06:30.290
IF I CAN'T GET AT LEAST A "B"
ON THE MIDTERM, I'M GONNA FLUNK.

06:30.357 --> 06:32.693
MAYBE I CAN HELP YOU OUT.

06:32.760 --> 06:34.695
REALLY?

06:34.762 --> 06:36.196
YOU ANY GOOD AT ALGEBRA?

06:36.263 --> 06:40.768
HA HA HA! OH, PLEASE.

06:40.834 --> 06:44.438
DOES THIS LOOK LIKE THE BODY
OF A GUY WHO'S GOOD AT ALGEBRA?

06:46.339 --> 06:47.541
THEN, HOW CAN YOU HELP?

06:47.608 --> 06:49.977
I KNOW THE SMARTEST KID
IN SCHOOL HE GOT ME

06:50.043 --> 06:53.013
THROUGH MATH, I'M SURE
HE COULD DO THE SAME FOR YOU.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.281
REALLY?
MM-HMM.

06:54.347 --> 06:58.185
UM, IF YOU CAN
GET HIM TO TUTOR ME,

06:58.251 --> 07:01.989
I'LL BE VERY...
GRATEFUL TO YOU.

07:04.324 --> 07:06.494
VERY GRATEFUL?

07:06.560 --> 07:09.129
VERY, VERY...

07:09.196 --> 07:10.531
GRATEFUL.

07:12.232 --> 07:13.801
KEE HEE HEE.

07:15.869 --> 07:17.004
EXCUSE ME.

07:19.707 --> 07:21.842
OW! WHAT'D I DO?
WHAT'D I DO?

07:21.909 --> 07:23.644
STEVE...

07:23.711 --> 07:24.878
I NEED YOUR HELP.

07:24.945 --> 07:27.147
NOW, EDDO, I'M BUSY,
AND I DON'T--

07:27.214 --> 07:29.216
WHOA, MAMA!

07:32.052 --> 07:34.722
THAT'S VONDA MAHONEY.
SHE'S FLUNKING ALGEBRA.

07:34.788 --> 07:36.590
IF YOU TUTOR HER
AND SHE PASSES,

07:36.657 --> 07:38.125
SHE'LL GO OUT
WITH ME.

07:38.191 --> 07:41.228
GOTCHA. AND WHAT'S
IN IT FOR THE STEVERINO?

07:43.964 --> 07:46.967
FRIENDSHIP.
WE'LL BE BEST BUDDIES.

07:47.034 --> 07:48.435
REALLY?

07:48.502 --> 07:50.871
EVEN WHEN OTHER
PEOPLE ARE AROUND?

07:52.472 --> 07:54.575
WELL, THAT'S
ASKING A LOT.

07:57.477 --> 07:58.812
OKAY.

08:00.914 --> 08:02.049
OH!

08:05.686 --> 08:07.855
EXCUSE ME, GREG.
I GOTTA GO HELP MY HELP.

08:07.921 --> 08:10.691
OH, TOO BAD. I WASN'T
DONE FLIRTING.

08:10.758 --> 08:12.626
WELL, NEITHER WAS I.

08:12.693 --> 08:13.861
IS THAT MY CHECK?

08:13.927 --> 08:15.729
NO, YOUR MEAL'S
ON THE HOUSE.

08:15.796 --> 08:17.765
THAT'S MY PHONE NUMBER.

08:25.639 --> 08:26.907
YOU KNOW, HARRIETTE

08:26.974 --> 08:28.742
I'VE BEEN PARADING
AROUND IN THIS GET-UP

08:28.809 --> 08:30.143
FOR A WHOLE MONTH NOW,

08:30.210 --> 08:33.013
AND I HAVEN'T ATTRACTED
ONE SINGLE SLEAZE BALL.

08:34.181 --> 08:37.785
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,
CARL, I'M NOT SURPRISED.

08:37.851 --> 08:39.887
WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

08:39.953 --> 08:44.224
ISN'T THE OBJECT TO LOOK AS
MUCH AS POSSIBLE LIKE A WOMAN?

08:44.291 --> 08:45.826
WELL, OF COURSE!

08:45.893 --> 08:49.663
THERE MIGHT BE A SMALL PROBLEM
WITH YOUR MOUSTACHE.

08:49.730 --> 08:51.899
OH, NO, NO, NO.

08:51.965 --> 08:54.835
THE POLICE CHIEF'S WIFE HAS
A BIGGER MOUSTACHE THAN ME.

08:58.806 --> 09:01.575
I DON'T KNOW. APPARENTLY,
THIS GUY IS HOT FOR HAIR.

09:02.542 --> 09:03.877
NO, IT'S...

09:03.944 --> 09:06.546
SOMETHING ELSE
MUST BE WRONG.

09:10.517 --> 09:12.085
THERE IS.

09:12.152 --> 09:13.486
CARL...

09:13.553 --> 09:15.756
YOU DON'T
WALK LIKE A WOMAN.

09:15.823 --> 09:19.059
YOU WALK LIKE
A LINEBACKER.

09:19.126 --> 09:23.230
OH, AND I SUPPOSE THAT YOU
KNOW HOW TO WALK LIKE A WOMAN?

09:25.465 --> 09:28.268
I'VE HAD A FEW YEARS'
EXPERIENCE.

09:28.335 --> 09:30.270
WATCH ME CLOSE.

09:35.175 --> 09:39.312
MM-HMM. SEE,
A WOMAN IS DAINTIER,

09:39.379 --> 09:40.981
MORE FEMININE.

09:41.048 --> 09:42.215
SHE...

09:42.282 --> 09:43.617
GLIDES.

09:45.452 --> 09:46.519
HEY, YOU ARE GOOD.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.822
I KNOW.

09:48.889 --> 09:50.357
LET ME TRY.
OKAY.

09:58.165 --> 09:59.700
SLOWER, CARL, SLOWER.

09:59.767 --> 10:00.801
HUH?

10:00.868 --> 10:01.869
OKAY.
SLOWER.

10:01.935 --> 10:02.870
OKAY.
SLOWER.

10:02.936 --> 10:05.605
LEFT TO RIGHT.
LEFT TO RIGHT.

10:05.673 --> 10:08.175
OH, WE'RE COOKING
WITH GREASE NOW, BABY.

10:08.241 --> 10:10.277
LOOK AT ME, NOW!

10:11.945 --> 10:14.782
SWEETHEART, I DON'T KNOW
IF I'LL CATCH A MUGGER,

10:14.848 --> 10:17.384
BUT I SURE NEEDED
A GOOD LAUGH THIS MORNING.

10:26.259 --> 10:27.995
OH, UNHAND HER, MADAM!

10:30.397 --> 10:32.700
STEVE,
TAKE IT EASY.

10:32.766 --> 10:36.003
LAURA, HOW CAN YOU BE
SO BLASE ABOUT THIS?

10:36.069 --> 10:39.106
MY GOD, GIRL, YOU'VE BEEN
WATCHING TOO MUCH GERALDO.

10:41.441 --> 10:43.176
STEVE...

10:43.243 --> 10:46.346
IT'S ME, CARL.

10:46.413 --> 10:48.381
OH...

10:48.448 --> 10:51.384
OH...OH!

10:53.053 --> 10:56.489
STEVE, RELAX.
I'M WORKING UNDERCOVER.

10:56.556 --> 10:59.292
I'M A MUGGING DECOY.

10:59.359 --> 11:01.161
BOY, THAT'S
A BIG RELIEF.

11:01.228 --> 11:03.997
I NEED THE CAR TONIGHT,
I'LL HAVE TO DRIVE YOU.

11:04.064 --> 11:05.899
OKAY, HONEY.

11:05.966 --> 11:08.101
WAIT A MINUTE,
SWEETHEART, THAT'S MY BAG.

11:08.168 --> 11:09.970
OH, EXCUSE ME.

11:10.037 --> 11:11.939
WATCH OUT, NOW.
EASY, EASY, CARL!

11:12.005 --> 11:14.708
I'VE GOT IT NOW,
BABE. I WON'T FALL.

11:14.775 --> 11:17.144
COME ON.
COME ON, NOW.

11:24.752 --> 11:25.719
STEVE! STEVE!

11:25.786 --> 11:26.920
AT YOUR SERVICE.

11:26.987 --> 11:28.789
I PASSED MY ALGEBRA EXAM,

11:28.856 --> 11:31.024
AND IT WAS THANKS
TO YOU AND YOUR TUTORING.

11:31.091 --> 11:33.961
OH, CONGRATULATIONS.
YOU DESERVE MOST OF THE CREDIT.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.395
YOUR OWN BRAIN
GOT YOU THERE.

11:35.462 --> 11:37.831
I JUST POINTED IT
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

11:37.898 --> 11:39.900
WELL, I STILL WANT
TO THANK YOU, STEVE.

11:39.967 --> 11:41.701
OH, YOU'RE WELCOME.

11:41.769 --> 11:46.473
NO, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
I WANT TO REALLY THANK YOU.

11:50.243 --> 11:53.646
OH, YOU'RE REALLY
WELCOME.

11:53.713 --> 11:55.515
AHEM.

11:55.582 --> 11:58.351
NO, NO, UM,
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

11:58.418 --> 11:59.953
THERE'S
A CERTAIN WAY

12:00.020 --> 12:02.189
THAT I SHOW
MY GRATITUDE.

12:02.255 --> 12:03.656
OH?

12:03.723 --> 12:06.093
WELL, I AM PARTIAL
TO CHEESE.

12:08.561 --> 12:12.599
NO, NO. I WAS THINKING
WE COULD GO OUT ON A DATE.

12:12.665 --> 12:14.001
A DATE?
MM-HMM.

12:14.067 --> 12:16.703
OOH, WITH--WITH ME?
MM-HMM.

12:16.770 --> 12:19.106
OOH, A DATE DATE?

STEVE!

12:35.422 --> 12:36.890

HUH? HUH?

12:36.957 --> 12:40.493
ARE YOU OKAY?
OH...OH. OH, I'M FINE!

12:40.560 --> 12:41.628
I'M FINE! I'M FINE!

12:41.694 --> 12:44.064
I AM CALM,
I AM COOL,

12:44.131 --> 12:46.934
AND I AM COLLECTED.
HMM, SEE?

12:51.338 --> 12:53.673
I'M MAKING YOU
NERVOUS, AREN'T I?

12:53.740 --> 12:56.676
OH, JUST A LITTLE!

12:56.743 --> 12:58.846
NOW, LOOK, VONDA,
I'M OVERWHELMED

12:58.912 --> 13:00.447
BY YOUR GENEROUS
OFFER,

13:00.513 --> 13:03.616
BUT I'M AFRAID
I'M GONNA HAVE
TO TURN YOU DOWN.

13:03.683 --> 13:06.386
WHY?
OH, YOU'RE GOOD.

13:08.188 --> 13:10.257
STEVE, DON'T YOU
UNDERSTAND

13:10.323 --> 13:13.861
THAT ONE DATE

13:14.627 --> 13:16.363
OH...

13:16.429 --> 13:17.898
WELL, HOW, EXACTLY?

13:17.965 --> 13:21.869
WELL, DON'T SOME OF THE KIDS

13:21.935 --> 13:23.703
WELL, WHAT'S THE WORD

13:23.770 --> 13:26.840
THE WORD IS NERD.
YEAH.

13:26.907 --> 13:28.976
WELL, AFTER YOU
GO OUT WITH ME,

13:29.042 --> 13:33.280
YOUR REP WOULD CHANGE.
YOU'D BECOME A...
LADIES' MAN.

13:34.381 --> 13:36.049
YEAH.

13:38.418 --> 13:40.420
WOW.

13:40.487 --> 13:43.523
FROM DUD TO STUD.

13:49.129 --> 13:52.099
OH! HE'S COMING!
HE'S COMING! OH, MY GOD!

13:52.165 --> 13:53.800

14:19.292 --> 14:21.895
YO, GIRLS,
SWEAT PATROL.

14:27.000 --> 14:30.870
I'D GIVE ANYTHING
TO BE LIKE
STEVE URKEL.

14:30.938 --> 14:34.908
FACE IT, EDDIE.
THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE
STEVE URKEL IN THIS WORLD.

14:34.975 --> 14:37.444
AND STEVE URKEL
IS ONE OF 'EM.

14:42.449 --> 14:43.984
OH!

14:45.953 --> 14:51.691
LAURA,
I SAVED MY BEST
PERSPIRATION FOR YOU.

14:51.758 --> 14:54.661
CARE TO MOP MY BROW?

14:54.727 --> 14:56.863
FORGET IT.

14:56.930 --> 14:59.466
NO SWEAT, MY PET.

15:00.833 --> 15:02.635
IN YOUR DREAMS.

15:02.702 --> 15:05.138
HEY, THIS IS
MY DREAM!

15:05.205 --> 15:08.408
WELL, THEN, NOT EVEN
IN YOUR DREAMS.

15:10.043 --> 15:11.378
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

15:11.444 --> 15:14.547
I'M BEING REJECTED
IN MY OWN FANTASY.

15:17.350 --> 15:19.386
STEVE...STEVE?

15:19.452 --> 15:21.254
OH...OH.

15:21.321 --> 15:25.925
VONDA, SIT DOWN A SEC.
NOW WE NEED TO TALK.

15:25.993 --> 15:27.527
ABOUT WHAT?

15:27.594 --> 15:29.529
WELL,
ABOUT REPUTATIONS.

15:29.596 --> 15:31.231
NOW WE'LL START WITH MINE.

15:31.298 --> 15:33.666
NOW I WOULDN'T BE COMFORTABLE
BEING A LADIES' MAN.

15:33.733 --> 15:35.802
I JUST WANNA BE
ONE LADY'S MAN.

15:35.868 --> 15:38.171
LAURA, RIGHT?
YES, INDEED.

15:38.238 --> 15:42.175
AND, NOW IF I HAVE THE
REPUTATION OF BEING A NERD,

15:42.242 --> 15:44.211
WELL, THAT MAKES
NO NEVER MIND TO ME,

15:44.277 --> 15:47.414
BECAUSE I LIKE MYSELF.

15:47.480 --> 15:50.150
HMM. WELL, GOOD FOR YOU.
I'M GLAD.

15:50.217 --> 15:54.454
NOW, UM, YOU HAVE
A REPUTATION, TOO,
DON'T YOU?

15:59.926 --> 16:01.028
I DON'T KNOW.

16:01.094 --> 16:02.662
WELL, SOME OF THE GUYS
IN SCHOOL

16:02.729 --> 16:06.899
SAY THAT YOU'RE, UM,
WELL, THAT YOU'RE, UM...

16:06.966 --> 16:08.068
[SIGHS]
EASY?

16:08.135 --> 16:10.903
YEAH. THAT'S IT.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.839
HEY, STEVE,

16:12.905 --> 16:14.407
I WANT TO BE
POPULAR, OKAY?

16:14.474 --> 16:16.476
BUT, VONDA,
YOU'RE TERRIFIC.

16:16.543 --> 16:19.412
YOU'RE PRETTY,
YOU'RE SMART AND YOU'RE NICE.

16:19.479 --> 16:23.250
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO BE EASY TO BE POPULAR.

16:23.316 --> 16:25.585
BUT I WANT GUYS
TO LIKE ME.

16:25.652 --> 16:29.489
THEY WILL. BUT FIRST
YOU HAVE TO LIKE YOURSELF.

16:30.423 --> 16:31.958
NOW...

16:32.025 --> 16:34.161
DO YOU LIKE
YOURSELF?

16:38.931 --> 16:41.000
NOT ALWAYS.

16:41.068 --> 16:44.237
WELL,
YOU CAN CHANGE THAT.

16:44.304 --> 16:45.872
BUT I'M SUPPOSED
TO GO OUT

16:45.938 --> 16:47.307
WITH EDDIE WINSLOW
TOMORROW NIGHT.

16:47.374 --> 16:48.808
STEVE,
HE'S EXPECTING ME

16:48.875 --> 16:51.678
TO BE VERY,
VERY GRATEFUL.

16:52.545 --> 16:55.082
OH, PISH TOSH.

16:56.116 --> 16:58.218
EDDIE IS MY BEST BUD,

16:58.285 --> 17:03.123
AND HE HAPPENS TO BE
A TRUE GENTLEMAN.

17:03.190 --> 17:05.425
EDDIE WINSLOW?

17:05.492 --> 17:06.726
I GUARANTEE YOU.

17:06.793 --> 17:08.128
HE WILL BE THE FIRST

17:08.195 --> 17:11.898
TO CONGRATULATE YOU
ON YOUR NEW LIFE.

17:11.964 --> 17:14.534
ACTUALLY,
HE'LL BE THE SECOND ONE.

17:17.104 --> 17:19.339
CONGRATULATIONS, VONDA.

17:27.114 --> 17:29.316
OH, GOSH,
I'M TELLING YOU,

17:29.382 --> 17:31.951
I NEVER KNEW THAT
HOCKEY COULD BE
SO MUCH FUN.

17:32.018 --> 17:33.586
THERE'S ALWAYS
GREAT ACTION
ON THE ICE.

17:33.653 --> 17:35.622
YEAH. HEY,
NOW--NOW, WHAT WERE
THE PLAYERS DOING

17:35.688 --> 17:37.190
WHEN THEY WEREN'T
PUNCHING, GOUGING

17:37.257 --> 17:39.025
AND SLAPPING EACH OTHER
WITH THOSE STICKS?

17:39.092 --> 17:40.760
OH, THAT?
THAT WAS HOCKEY!

17:40.827 --> 17:42.795
GET OUT OF HERE!

17:42.862 --> 17:45.232
YOU SURE COULD GET RID
OF ALL YOUR AGGRESSIONS.

17:45.298 --> 17:47.634
OH, YEAH. IT'S A TERRIFIC GAME.
YEAH.

17:48.735 --> 17:50.737
THANKS FOR ANOTHER
GREAT EVENING, GREG.

17:50.803 --> 17:53.540
MY PLEASURE. RACHEL,
I THINK YOU'RE TERRIFIC.

17:53.606 --> 17:56.109
IN FACT, SO IS
YOUR WHOLE FAMILY.

17:56.176 --> 17:59.045
THEY'RE GOOD, SOLID,
SALT-OF-THE-EARTH
PEOPLE.

17:59.112 --> 18:01.914
HA HA HA HA!

18:01.981 --> 18:04.917
HEY, GREG, HEY, RACHEL.
GREAT NEWS.

18:04.984 --> 18:07.887
I GOT MUGGED!
HA HA HA HA!

18:07.954 --> 18:10.022
HARRIETTE IS
GONNA BE SO PROUD!

18:10.089 --> 18:13.993
HEY, HONEY, SWEETHEART,
IT WORKED!

18:14.060 --> 18:15.428
HEY, HARRIETTE!

18:20.099 --> 18:21.868
YEAH,
WE'RE GOOD, SOLID,

18:21.934 --> 18:23.870
SALT-OF-THE-EARTH
PEOPLE.

18:27.640 --> 18:29.409
WELL...

18:29.476 --> 18:30.977
WELL...

18:31.043 --> 18:32.712
GOODNIGHT, GREG.

18:32.779 --> 18:34.314
GOODNIGHT, RACHEL.

18:43.490 --> 18:46.193
LOOK, WHY DON'T YOU
CALL ME TOMORROW, OKAY?

18:48.060 --> 18:49.396
[SIGHS]

18:50.497 --> 18:51.798
OKAY.

18:59.406 --> 19:02.575
RACHEL, I NEED
TO KNOW SOMETHING.

19:02.642 --> 19:04.744
WE'VE GONE OUT
SEVERAL TIMES NOW,

19:04.811 --> 19:07.480
AND I THINK WE'RE GOOD
FOR EACH OTHER.

19:07.547 --> 19:10.783
WELL, I THINK SO,
TOO, GREG.

19:10.850 --> 19:13.220
YOU DO? THEN
WHY DO I FEEL

19:13.286 --> 19:14.854
YOU'RE ALWAYS
BACKING AWAY FROM ME?

19:14.921 --> 19:16.356
UH, I--I DON'T THINK I'M--

19:16.423 --> 19:21.228
RACHEL, I'D LIKE
FOR THIS RELATIONSHIP
TO GO SOMEWHERE.

19:21.294 --> 19:23.596
BUT IF YOU'RE NOT
READY FOR THAT,

19:23.663 --> 19:26.366
WELL, I'D LIKE FOR YOU
TO LET ME KNOW NOW.

19:26.433 --> 19:29.969
THAT WAY WE DON'T
WASTE EACH OTHER'S TIME.

19:30.036 --> 19:32.805
I AM READY
FOR A RELATIONSHIP.

19:32.872 --> 19:34.341
OH?

19:34.407 --> 19:36.909
THEN WHY ARE
YOU STILL WEARING
YOUR WEDDING RING?

19:42.181 --> 19:44.651
I'LL CALL YOU
TOMORROW.

19:44.717 --> 19:46.185
SLEEP TIGHT.

19:46.253 --> 19:48.455
YOU, TOO.

20:18.518 --> 20:20.653
OH, HI, EDDO.
HI, VONDA.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.955
HEY, STEVE. DOESN'T VONDA
LOOK GREAT?

20:23.022 --> 20:25.592
OH, YES, AS USUAL.

20:25.658 --> 20:28.227
I JUST PICKED VONDA UP.
WE'RE GONNA GRAB A BITE,

20:28.295 --> 20:29.929
THEN IT'S RIGHT
BACK TO VONDA'S.

20:29.996 --> 20:33.065
HER PARENTS AREN'T HOME.

20:33.132 --> 20:35.902
HEY, HERE'S A THOUGHT--
LET'S GET THE FOOD TO GO.

20:37.203 --> 20:39.739
VONDA, DID YOU
TELL EDDO
THE GOOD NEWS?

20:39.806 --> 20:43.310
WHAT GOOD NEWS?
THE GOOD NEWS
AIN'T HAPPENED YET.

20:46.479 --> 20:50.517
UH, EDDIE,
STEVE AND I
HAD A NICE TALK,

20:50.583 --> 20:53.353
AND, UH, HE
HELPED ME REALIZE

20:53.420 --> 20:56.456
THAT I DON'T
HAVE TO BE EASY
TO BE POPULAR.

20:58.758 --> 21:00.427
YOU DON'T?

21:01.461 --> 21:03.996
NO, I DON'T.
SO FROM NOW ON

21:04.063 --> 21:06.566
I'M NOT
EVEN GONNA KISS
ON THE FIRST DATE.

21:06.633 --> 21:09.702
THANKS TO STEVE,
I HAVE RESPECT
FOR MYSELF NOW.

21:10.470 --> 21:12.639
THAT'S GREAT.

21:13.740 --> 21:15.475
EXCUSE US.

21:15.542 --> 21:18.445
EDDO? IS THERE
A PROBLEM, EDDO?

21:18.511 --> 21:22.849
WHAT'S THE MATTER? EDDO?
OOH! OOH! EDDO, CHOKING.

21:25.385 --> 21:26.353
HI, EVERYBODY.

21:26.419 --> 21:27.387
HEY!
HI.

21:27.454 --> 21:29.322
SWEETIE, I GOT
MY COMMENDATION

21:29.389 --> 21:30.390
FOR CATCHING
THE MUGGER.

21:30.457 --> 21:32.425
OH, CARL,
THAT'S GREAT!

21:32.492 --> 21:35.428
BUT LT. MURTAGH IS JEALOUS.
WHAT?

21:35.495 --> 21:38.998
HE SAYS HE WON'T
REST UNTIL HE GETS
A COMMENDATION, TOO.

21:40.232 --> 21:41.701
WINSLOW!

21:43.503 --> 21:45.438
WINSLOW, HURRY UP,
WILL YOU?

21:45.505 --> 21:49.876
THE CLOCK IS TICKING
ON THIS 18-HOUR GIRDLE.

21:49.942 --> 21:51.478
AFTER YOU, BABE.

21:52.679 --> 21:54.914
DON'T EVEN
THINK ABOUT IT.
