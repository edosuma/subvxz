BARRY: My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

00:07.425 --> 00:10.258
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,

00:10.428 --> 00:13.135
but secretly, with the help of my friends
at 8. TA. R. Labs,

00:13.306 --> 00:16.548
I ﬁght crime
and ﬁnd other meta-humans like me.

00:16.726 --> 00:18.808
I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,

00:18.978 --> 00:21.765
but in doing so,
I opened up our world to new threats.

00:22.565 --> 00:25.432

fast enough to stop them.

to protect Iris.

00:35.995 --> 00:37.986
-I felt slower.
-I did it.

00:38.164 --> 00:41.122
I stole your speed. I gave it to Zoom.

00:41.459 --> 00:42.448

00:42.627 --> 00:45.869
Bring me the rest of Flash's speed.

00:46.631 --> 00:47.620

00:58.976 --> 01:02.093
We're closing the breaches. All of them.

01:02.271 --> 01:08.392
Soon, every portal between this earth
and mine will no longer exist.

01:08.569 --> 01:11.936
I've become distracted by this earth.

01:12.114 --> 01:14.605

lost track of was you, Jesse.

01:24.835 --> 01:27.542
You are my conscience. My beating heart.

01:27.880 --> 01:30.166
You're the reason I've made it this far
in my ﬁght against Zoom.

01:30.341 --> 01:34.004
And now, Ijust need you to hang on.

01:35.179 --> 01:37.636
hang on a little bit longer.

01:37.807 --> 01:41.425

Well, college is a hell of a lot closer

02:34.905 --> 02:37.647
-Ah.
-Hey. Did you tell Henry?

02:39.577 --> 02:43.195
No. All right, look, if he knew,
he would just try to talk me out of it,

02:43.372 --> 02:46.205
and he probably would so...

02:47.293 --> 02:49.079

02:50.880 --> 02:53.166
Yeah. I'll make us some coffee.

I can think of right now,

anything dangerous before.

03:08.397 --> 03:11.639
Look, I, I get why you're doing this.

03:12.151 --> 03:13.482
