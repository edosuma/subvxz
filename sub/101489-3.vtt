14:41.930 --> 14:44.833
(exhaling)

14:47.568 --> 14:48.803
(Baxter retching)

14:48.837 --> 14:50.471
(Odis exhales)

14:50.504 --> 14:52.807
The basement's clear.

14:52.841 --> 14:55.376
‐I got to...
‐Thank you.

15:10.224 --> 15:12.293
(both panting)

15:12.326 --> 15:14.328
DEAFY:
I'm gonna ask you
one last time.

15:15.329 --> 15:17.531
Where's your sister?

15:17.565 --> 15:18.967
We told you.

15:19.000 --> 15:22.570
Zelmare is in Our Lady of Regret
Women's Prison

15:22.603 --> 15:25.907
serving five years
for armed robbery.

15:25.940 --> 15:28.576
Was in the women's
correctional.

15:28.609 --> 15:31.345
She escaped last night.

15:31.379 --> 15:33.214
DIBRELL:
I‐I told that girl.

15:33.247 --> 15:34.783
I told her.

15:34.816 --> 15:36.384
This is His will.

15:36.417 --> 15:38.386
He is sending you a message,

15:38.419 --> 15:40.688
and you better listen.

15:40.721 --> 15:43.457
You know who I mean
when I say "His will"?

15:43.491 --> 15:45.293
Yes, ma'am, I most certainly do.

15:45.326 --> 15:46.660
Well, I told her,

15:46.694 --> 15:48.329
you stay in that place

15:48.362 --> 15:50.398
and get your head
screwed on right.

15:50.431 --> 15:51.833
Give up the sinning.

15:51.866 --> 15:53.367
Renounce your lawlessness

15:53.401 --> 15:54.803
and appropriation of spirits.

15:54.836 --> 15:56.404
We were put on this Earth

15:56.437 --> 15:58.572
to toil in His name.

15:58.606 --> 16:00.408
Not to sow oats.

16:02.676 --> 16:05.513
‐So you haven't seen her?
‐Seen her?

16:05.546 --> 16:07.816
Officer, if I ever see

16:07.849 --> 16:09.918
my sister again,

16:09.951 --> 16:13.421
I'm gonna wring her neck.

16:13.454 --> 16:15.489
♪ ♪

16:18.760 --> 16:22.463
(inhales, exhales quietly)

16:27.501 --> 16:29.003
You all have a nice night.

16:29.037 --> 16:30.738
Sorry for the disturbance.

16:36.811 --> 16:38.813
(door closes)

16:50.324 --> 16:52.660
Just...

16:52.693 --> 16:55.329
give me a moment.

17:04.906 --> 17:06.908
(exhales)

17:13.948 --> 17:15.683
Well, let's go check the damage.

17:15.716 --> 17:18.719
Ethelrida, stay down here
and see about cleaning up.

17:58.059 --> 18:00.528
(entry bell jingles)

18:10.571 --> 18:13.007
‐You had a close call.
‐Hmm?

18:13.041 --> 18:15.543
‐Is what I heard.
‐Oh.

18:15.576 --> 18:19.047
Yet cooler heads prevailed.

18:20.081 --> 18:21.715
‐Here you are.
‐I think

18:21.750 --> 18:24.018
some flapjacks
this morning, Nadine.

18:24.052 --> 18:26.054
You got it.

18:28.589 --> 18:29.958
‐I'll take this.
‐No, that's all right.

18:29.991 --> 18:32.026
‐Okay.
‐You're not eating?

18:32.060 --> 18:33.795
I'm not saying

18:33.828 --> 18:37.665
it wasn't a smart play,
moving on the slaughterhouses.

18:37.698 --> 18:40.568
But you must've knew
it wouldn't stick.

18:40.601 --> 18:43.604
Well, he gave permission,
the old man.

18:43.637 --> 18:45.073
Last week at the playground.

18:45.106 --> 18:46.775
(scoffs)

18:48.777 --> 18:50.611
Well, you tell me one thing

18:50.644 --> 18:51.980
ever got given to you
in this world

18:52.013 --> 18:54.082
that you didn't have to take.
Hmm?

18:54.115 --> 18:55.817
And I'm saying...

18:57.118 --> 18:59.120
...respect the deal.

19:05.126 --> 19:06.795
‐Thank you.
‐Mm‐hmm.

19:08.129 --> 19:12.133
You didn't serve in the war,
did you?

19:13.667 --> 19:15.103
(grunts)

19:15.136 --> 19:17.105
I was in the legal corps.

19:17.138 --> 19:19.774
Army. Pushing papers.

19:19.808 --> 19:21.776
After the cease‐fire,

19:21.810 --> 19:25.113
they send me to Nuremberg
for the trials.

19:25.146 --> 19:28.649
Last Negro in Germany,
I'd imagine.

19:28.682 --> 19:30.051
Mm‐hmm.

19:31.619 --> 19:33.621
You ever heard of the Double V?

19:33.654 --> 19:35.656
Hmm.

19:35.689 --> 19:37.658
It's what they sold us.

19:37.691 --> 19:39.127
Mm‐hmm.

19:39.160 --> 19:41.796
Fight for our country,
and we get two victories.

19:41.830 --> 19:45.133
One for America and one
for we sons of servitude.

19:45.166 --> 19:46.667
No more lynchings.

19:46.700 --> 19:49.137
No more blackjacks at the polls.

19:49.170 --> 19:51.605
Hmm? Okay.

19:51.639 --> 19:55.076
So, they send me to Nuremberg,

19:55.109 --> 19:59.613
and this colonel tells me
he's got a big job for me.

19:59.647 --> 20:03.084
Says, "You're gonna interview
Hermann Göring,

20:03.117 --> 20:05.619
the Reichsmarschall himself."

20:05.653 --> 20:08.089
Says, "Days, weeks,

20:08.122 --> 20:10.624
however long it takes
to get him to talk."

20:10.658 --> 20:14.095
Says, "I need you,
Doctor Senator, Esquire,

20:14.128 --> 20:18.099
"to use your training,
your skills

20:18.132 --> 20:21.635
to build the People's case."

20:21.669 --> 20:23.637
Well, now,

20:23.671 --> 20:25.706
what is that
if not the double victory?

20:25.740 --> 20:27.641
Hmm?

20:27.675 --> 20:30.644
So I sit with the man
for six weeks,

20:30.678 --> 20:33.647
eight hours a day,
six days a week,

20:33.681 --> 20:35.649
and we get into it.

20:35.683 --> 20:38.119
The first two weeks,

20:38.152 --> 20:41.655
he just stares at me,
murder in his eyes.

20:41.689 --> 20:43.657
But I use my wiles.

20:43.691 --> 20:46.127
You know, appeal to his ego.

20:46.160 --> 20:47.661
Get him talking.

20:47.695 --> 20:51.132
Ah. Soon he won't shut up.

20:51.165 --> 20:53.134
Bragging
about every little thing,

20:53.167 --> 20:55.136
and I type it down
and write it up for the colonel

20:55.169 --> 20:57.205
word‐for‐word.

20:57.238 --> 20:59.273
I spend two weeks
crafting my conclusion,

20:59.307 --> 21:02.110
my analysis
of international law.

21:02.143 --> 21:06.881
Then, one Sunday morning,
after services,

21:06.915 --> 21:11.886
I knock on the colonel's door
and I give him my report.

21:13.822 --> 21:16.290
You know what he does?

21:16.324 --> 21:18.659
Throws it in the trash.

21:19.861 --> 21:21.863
Yeah.

21:21.896 --> 21:25.299
400 pages with footnotes.

21:25.333 --> 21:29.637
Throws it in the trash
and says...

21:29.670 --> 21:31.806
"I just wanted to make

21:31.840 --> 21:34.142
that old Nazi squirm..."

21:35.877 --> 21:39.013
"...having to answer
to a Negro."

21:43.151 --> 21:48.656
So... you say respect the deal?

21:51.125 --> 21:54.595
(silverware clatters)

21:54.628 --> 21:57.899
Excuse me if I say

21:57.932 --> 22:01.235
our word is exactly
as good as yours.

22:08.409 --> 22:12.280
The slaughterhouses,
they belong to us.

22:13.948 --> 22:15.950
Deal or no deal.

22:17.285 --> 22:20.654
You can call it the cost
of transition.

22:22.924 --> 22:24.959
I'll pass it on.

22:34.936 --> 22:37.071
MILLIGAN:
There's no mystery to it.

22:37.105 --> 22:41.209
Everything breaks, and there's
a right way to fix it.

22:42.977 --> 22:45.747
Are you Jewish?

22:46.981 --> 22:48.783
No.

22:50.018 --> 22:52.987
Then how come
they call you Rabbi?

22:53.021 --> 22:55.289
Isn't rabbi a Jewish priest?

22:56.724 --> 22:58.726
You ever play poker?

23:00.394 --> 23:04.766
But you know there's a game
called poker, played with cards.

23:07.001 --> 23:09.971
Well, there's this saying
in poker:

23:10.004 --> 23:12.206
you play the hand you're dealt.

23:14.308 --> 23:16.978
You and me, we're proof of that.

23:21.182 --> 23:24.753
You see, when yours truly
was a boy,

23:24.786 --> 23:26.921
he had the same thing happen
to him, what happened to you.

23:30.024 --> 23:31.993
SATCHEL:
You got traded?

23:32.026 --> 23:33.361
What?

23:33.394 --> 23:35.363
From baseball.

23:35.396 --> 23:40.301
That's what my daddy said.
I got traded to another team.

23:43.104 --> 23:44.305
Exactly.

23:45.339 --> 23:47.675
I got traded twice.

23:50.278 --> 23:52.413
Except, well, for you,
you get to go back

23:52.446 --> 23:55.316
to your original team one day.

23:57.118 --> 23:58.286
Is this your original team?

23:58.319 --> 23:59.287
No.

23:59.320 --> 24:01.322
My team was shite.

24:04.392 --> 24:06.060
(door opens)

24:15.536 --> 24:17.839
What are these words?

24:18.840 --> 24:20.108
Team, traded?

24:20.141 --> 24:21.509
It's nothing.

24:21.542 --> 24:23.277
Doesn't matter.

24:24.913 --> 24:26.280
Say it again.

24:26.314 --> 24:27.916
I want to, I want to hear.

24:27.949 --> 24:29.951
‐Yeah.
‐We'll get out of your way.

24:32.553 --> 24:34.022
(Gaetano laughs)

24:35.356 --> 24:38.893
This was our home in Italy,
my country.

24:38.927 --> 24:41.129
Yeah.
(chuckles)

24:41.162 --> 24:42.864
The fascists knock it down,

24:42.897 --> 24:45.366
and so I live in the trees.

24:45.399 --> 24:47.401
(chuckles)

24:47.435 --> 24:48.937
(sighs)

24:52.974 --> 24:54.976
(chuckles)

25:01.082 --> 25:05.019
So... you're Irish, hmm?

25:05.053 --> 25:07.155
American.

25:07.188 --> 25:09.190
I'm American.

25:11.425 --> 25:14.395
(sighs)

25:17.031 --> 25:19.267
But you came to us
when you were just a boy.

25:23.604 --> 25:27.541
And you killed
your own father...

25:27.575 --> 25:29.443
for us.

25:31.212 --> 25:33.848
What's that like?

25:40.254 --> 25:43.124
(gunshot)

25:43.157 --> 25:44.558
Who remembers?

25:44.592 --> 25:46.594
"Who remembers?"
I like it.

25:46.627 --> 25:48.496
(Gaetano chuckles)

25:49.530 --> 25:51.833
What the fuck is this?

25:53.968 --> 25:55.436
I got it.

25:56.570 --> 25:59.240
A trade, yeah?

25:59.273 --> 26:02.376
You, Rabbi, for you.

26:02.410 --> 26:03.377
Hmm.

26:03.411 --> 26:05.013
Come on, kid.

26:05.046 --> 26:06.580
Get out of my chair.

26:06.614 --> 26:09.450
No.

26:09.483 --> 26:12.220
I like it.

26:12.253 --> 26:14.188
It's too big for you, no?

26:14.222 --> 26:16.224
Up.

26:22.997 --> 26:25.299
Did you make trouble at
the slaughterhouse last night?

26:25.333 --> 26:27.335
Who, me?

26:28.336 --> 26:30.071
I take care of things.

26:30.104 --> 26:32.440
I'm the boss, I'm the one
who takes care of things.

26:32.473 --> 26:35.476
(Gaetano laughing)

26:37.511 --> 26:39.080
You?

26:39.113 --> 26:42.583
You can't even take care
of this doctor

26:42.616 --> 26:45.386
who kicks our family
out on the street.

26:45.419 --> 26:47.956
What'd you say to me?

26:47.989 --> 26:49.257
‐You can't even take care of...
‐(Satchel sneezes)

26:51.192 --> 26:52.493
Why is he in here?

26:52.526 --> 26:54.095
‐This is my office.
‐My mistake.

26:54.128 --> 26:55.663
Your man asked me
to fix the radiator.

26:55.696 --> 26:56.931
I...

26:56.965 --> 26:59.333
There's secret stuff here.

26:59.367 --> 27:00.334
And he's a...

27:00.368 --> 27:02.003
Think.

27:02.036 --> 27:04.005
Retard, use your head next time.

27:04.038 --> 27:05.273
And you.

27:05.306 --> 27:06.540
You think I can't take care

27:06.574 --> 27:07.641
of some piece‐of‐shit
pencil pusher?

27:07.675 --> 27:09.343
Is that what you think?!

27:09.377 --> 27:11.212
Mm‐hmm.

27:12.246 --> 27:13.681
Get out.

27:13.714 --> 27:15.449
All of you.

27:22.590 --> 27:24.558
You follow orders.

27:24.592 --> 27:26.627
You hear me?
Or go home.

27:28.062 --> 27:30.064
What are you doing?
Put that back.

27:32.666 --> 27:34.202
(clicks tongue)

27:39.607 --> 27:42.076
(whispering):
Look at this fucking mess.

27:47.015 --> 27:48.983
It's not too big.

27:49.017 --> 27:51.019
It's just right.

28:06.067 --> 28:08.970
(sighs)
You were at St. Bartholomew's.

28:09.003 --> 28:11.105
Yes, sir, three years.

28:11.139 --> 28:12.373
Good souls all, but...

28:12.406 --> 28:14.575
(sighs)

28:14.608 --> 28:17.378
I like to go where I feel
I can be most useful,

28:17.411 --> 28:19.513
and I heard
you might have hardship.

28:19.547 --> 28:22.183
Three of our older nurses
retired last month.

28:22.216 --> 28:23.584
(sighs)

28:23.617 --> 28:27.721
Experience‐‐ it can't be bought.

28:27.756 --> 28:30.992
Now, I myself have
over ten years' service,

28:31.025 --> 28:32.393
starting as a candy striper

28:32.426 --> 28:35.129
and delivering treats
to the tots.

28:35.163 --> 28:37.999
You worked for Allen Sneet?

28:38.032 --> 28:42.570
Yes, sir, he's a fair boss,
considerate but firm.

28:44.372 --> 28:46.540
He'll give you
a good recommendation?

28:46.574 --> 28:50.644
Hmm, well, I should hope so.

28:50.678 --> 28:53.347
I used to bake him
cookies once a week.

28:54.382 --> 28:56.617
We are shorthanded right now.

28:56.650 --> 28:58.619
Well, you can't have that,

28:58.652 --> 29:01.055
what with cold and flu season
coming on.

29:04.725 --> 29:07.728
Can you start next week?

29:09.563 --> 29:12.333
I'll be here with bells on.

29:13.601 --> 29:16.104
Fine.

29:16.137 --> 29:18.106
Go see Mrs. Meeker
in the office.

29:18.139 --> 29:20.775
‐She'll start the paperwork.
‐Oh. (chuckles)

29:20.809 --> 29:24.678
If‐if there is one thing I love,
it's a man of action

29:24.712 --> 29:26.714

all straight out of Mississippi

48:59.854 --> 49:01.389

49:02.857 --> 49:04.292
‐Mom?
‐That's not‐‐

49:04.325 --> 49:07.228

49:16.670 --> 49:20.241
My daddy built the railroad.

49:20.274 --> 49:25.413
He was a Chinaman,
heard voices on the breeze.

49:25.446 --> 49:27.849
He ended up living in a cave
with a coyote

49:27.882 --> 49:30.885
who tricked him in his sleep.

49:35.824 --> 49:38.592
He had two shadows, my daddy.

49:38.626 --> 49:41.229
‐One for him...
‐(lighter flicks)

49:44.966 --> 49:46.835
...one for the devil.

49:46.868 --> 49:49.838
(coyote howling)

49:51.439 --> 49:54.308
He used to hug me
around my neck,

49:54.342 --> 49:57.812
just a little too hard,
late at night.

49:57.846 --> 50:01.382
See, people think
it's houses get haunted.

50:11.359 --> 50:13.327

‐What's he need it for?

50:41.890 --> 50:43.624
Nobody breaks

don't just hand over money.
