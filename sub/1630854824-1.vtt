WEBVTT

02:58.512 --> 03:00.381
It's okay.

03:00.381 --> 03:01.715
Relax.

03:01.715 --> 03:04.318
I'm not gonna hurt you.

03:04.318 --> 03:07.187
I'm just gonna learn about you
for a little while.

03:07.187 --> 03:08.722
Is that okay?

03:14.962 --> 03:16.730
I'm gonna name you Kerolien

03:16.730 --> 03:18.532
after my friend at school.

03:18.532 --> 03:20.268
She's really nice.

03:20.268 --> 03:23.937
But she farts in class sometimes
and pretends like she didn't.

03:23.937 --> 03:25.773
So, please don't do that,

03:25.773 --> 03:27.641
'cause you're sharing
this jar now,

03:27.641 --> 03:30.711
and the others won't like you
if you smell. Okay?

04:08.416 --> 04:10.351
Hi there.

04:11.652 --> 04:12.886
I'm not from around here,

04:12.886 --> 04:15.323
but I was hoping to make
some new friends.

04:20.227 --> 04:22.963
Can I talk to you
for a little bit?

04:27.034 --> 04:30.438
I... I don't talk to strangers.

04:31.472 --> 04:32.640
Of course you don't.

04:32.640 --> 04:35.242
You shouldn't. You're smart.

04:36.644 --> 04:39.179
But I'm here to be your friend,

04:39.179 --> 04:41.949
so, hopefully, we won't
be strangers for too long.

04:41.949 --> 04:44.485
What's your name?

04:44.485 --> 04:46.554
Wenling.

04:46.554 --> 04:48.389
But everyone calls me Wen.

04:48.389 --> 04:50.424
Well, it's nice
to meet you, Wen.

04:51.425 --> 04:53.226
My name's Leonard.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.770
I see you're catching grasshoppers.

05:02.770 --> 05:04.838
Can I help you?

05:05.639 --> 05:08.308
Um, I guess so.

05:08.308 --> 05:11.445
I loved catching grasshoppers
when I was your age.

05:19.820 --> 05:22.155
- Oh, you're really good.
- Thanks, Wen.

05:22.155 --> 05:24.358
Can you pass me the jar
there, please?

05:27.294 --> 05:28.796
Wait.

05:28.796 --> 05:30.731
Let the ones inside
calm down a bit.

05:30.731 --> 05:32.933
We don't want them to panic.

05:36.069 --> 05:38.572
There you go.

05:38.572 --> 05:40.040
Are you just a natural,

05:40.040 --> 05:41.575
or did someone teach you
how to catch grasshoppers?

05:41.575 --> 05:43.711
Daddy Eric taught me.

05:43.711 --> 05:45.212
I'm studying them.

05:45.212 --> 05:48.649
I'm gonna take care of animals
when I grow up.

05:49.450 --> 05:51.318
You call your dad
by his first name?

05:52.119 --> 05:54.321
It's so they know
who I'm talking to.

05:54.321 --> 05:57.090
There's Daddy Eric
and Daddy Andrew.

05:58.225 --> 06:01.128
All the other kids at school
only have one dad.

06:01.128 --> 06:04.432
All the Disney Channel shows
only have one dad, too.

06:06.033 --> 06:07.701
Well, does that bother you?

06:07.701 --> 06:09.169
No.

06:09.169 --> 06:11.405
Except when my
guidance counselor keeps saying

06:11.405 --> 06:14.107
how it's so great
that I have two dads.

06:14.107 --> 06:15.643
For some reason,
it makes me feel like

06:15.643 --> 06:17.445
she's saying the opposite.

06:26.954 --> 06:28.321
What's wrong?

06:30.791 --> 06:32.392
Nothing.

06:32.392 --> 06:34.161
Nothing at all.

06:34.161 --> 06:35.796
How old are you, Wen?

06:35.796 --> 06:37.898
I'll be eight in six days.

06:37.898 --> 06:40.701
Well, happy almost-birthday.

06:40.701 --> 06:43.604
In fact, it just so happens

06:43.604 --> 06:45.439
that I have something for you.

06:45.439 --> 06:47.007
I saw it,
and I thought it was pretty,

06:47.007 --> 06:48.442
so I decided to keep it.

06:48.442 --> 06:51.278
So, consider it
an early birthday present.

06:52.212 --> 06:53.380
And if you don't like it,

06:53.380 --> 06:55.749
we can play a game
with it instead.

06:55.749 --> 06:57.350
What kind of game?

06:57.350 --> 07:00.320
We'll take turns pulling petals
off and asking questions,

07:00.320 --> 07:03.190
and by the time we're done,
we'll know each other better.

07:03.190 --> 07:06.126
- Be better friends.
- Hmm, 'kay.

07:06.960 --> 07:09.029
What's your favorite movie?

07:09.029 --> 07:10.631
Kiki's Delivery Service.

07:11.665 --> 07:13.634
I haven't seen that.

07:13.634 --> 07:15.603
I'll check it out.

07:15.603 --> 07:17.237
Okay, your turn.

07:20.741 --> 07:22.910
Why are you here?

07:26.580 --> 07:28.015
Leonard?

07:30.651 --> 07:32.553
Why am I here?

07:33.721 --> 07:36.590
Well, I suppose I'm here
to make friends with you

07:36.590 --> 07:38.258
and your dads.

07:38.258 --> 07:40.193
Maybe catch some more grasshoppers.

07:42.730 --> 07:45.365
How'd you get that tiny
little scar on your lip?

07:47.835 --> 07:49.537
I'm so sorry, Wen.

07:50.370 --> 07:52.405
I shouldn't have asked that.

07:52.405 --> 07:55.976
It's... It's too personal,
even for this game.

07:55.976 --> 07:57.177
It's okay.

07:57.177 --> 07:58.746
My lip was broken
when I was born.

07:58.746 --> 08:03.083
My dads said it took a lot
of doctors to fix it.

08:03.083 --> 08:04.752
Well, I don't have a scar
like you,

08:04.752 --> 08:07.287
but if you could look inside,

08:07.287 --> 08:09.590
you'd see that my heart
is broken.

08:09.590 --> 08:11.491
Why is it broken?

08:11.491 --> 08:14.294
Because of what I have
to do today.

08:14.294 --> 08:15.963
What do you have to do?

08:22.069 --> 08:24.137
Are they your friends?

08:25.105 --> 08:27.340
You're my friend, Wen.

08:27.340 --> 08:30.410
No matter what happens,
I want you to remember that.

08:30.410 --> 08:35.549
The others who are coming are
more like people I work with.

08:37.384 --> 08:41.488
You see, the four of us have
a very important job to do.

08:41.488 --> 08:44.825
In fact, it might be
the most important job

08:44.825 --> 08:47.595
in the history of the world.

08:55.669 --> 08:57.204
This isn't about you, Wen.

08:57.204 --> 08:58.606
Or your dads.

08:58.606 --> 08:59.873
Okay?

09:00.708 --> 09:03.210
You haven't done anything wrong,
but I'm afraid the three of you

09:03.210 --> 09:05.646
are gonna have to make
some tough decisions.

09:05.646 --> 09:07.147
Terrible decisions.

09:07.147 --> 09:09.783
And I wish with all my broken
heart that you didn't have to.

09:09.783 --> 09:12.052
Wen!

09:13.754 --> 09:15.956
Your dads won't want
to let us in.

09:15.956 --> 09:18.258
You have to tell them they must.

09:18.258 --> 09:20.628
Otherwise, we're gonna have
to find our own way in.

09:20.628 --> 09:22.462
Do you understand?

09:23.831 --> 09:25.833
Wen, tell me you understand!

09:35.108 --> 09:36.744
♪ Oh

09:36.744 --> 09:38.445
- ♪ Love is always better...

09:40.580 --> 09:42.482
- This isn't bad.
- The cheese is good.

09:42.482 --> 09:44.317
See? Factual proof.
There she is.

09:44.317 --> 09:45.585
You didn't need to check on her.

09:45.585 --> 09:47.154
You have to come inside
right now.

09:47.154 --> 09:48.588
There's strangers,
and they want to come in,

09:48.588 --> 09:50.157
- and they're scary!
- Whoa, whoa, slow down.

09:50.157 --> 09:52.325
- Hurry, now!
- Okay, okay, I'm coming.

09:52.325 --> 09:54.527
- We're coming inside.
- God, okay.

09:54.527 --> 09:56.563
- Come on!
- Honey, what's happening?

09:56.563 --> 09:58.231
- Tell me what's so...
- Relax, relax. Okay. It's okay.

09:58.231 --> 10:01.401
- It's okay.
- Wen, what's up?

10:01.401 --> 10:04.037
Wen, Wen, it's okay.
Listen, sweetie. What happened?

10:04.037 --> 10:05.172
What scared you?

10:05.172 --> 10:06.940
There... there were four
of them.

10:06.940 --> 10:09.142
The big one, his name's Leonard.

10:09.142 --> 10:11.478
He... he says
we have to help them.

10:11.478 --> 10:13.313
He says they have
the most important job

10:13.313 --> 10:15.816
in the history of the world.

10:17.818 --> 10:19.486
Jehovah's Witnesses?

10:19.486 --> 10:20.788
Great.

10:20.788 --> 10:23.290
They have these weapons.

10:37.604 --> 10:39.907
Hello in there.

10:39.907 --> 10:41.308
My name is Leonard,

10:41.308 --> 10:43.443
and I'm here
with some associates of mine.

10:43.443 --> 10:45.345
Can you open the door, please?

10:50.550 --> 10:53.120
This guy is frigging huge.

10:53.120 --> 10:55.088
What do we do?

10:56.223 --> 10:58.191
I don't know. Um...

10:58.191 --> 11:00.460
tell them to go away nicely?

11:01.929 --> 11:04.531
Hi. Uh, hello, Leonard. We...

11:04.531 --> 11:06.533
Is that Daddy Andrew
or Daddy Eric?

11:06.533 --> 11:08.568
I met your delightful daughter
Wen already.

11:08.568 --> 11:12.105
She's so thoughtful and kind.
You two should be very proud.

11:13.974 --> 11:15.475
This is Eric.

11:15.475 --> 11:17.677
Is there something
we can help you with?

11:17.677 --> 11:19.012
There is.

11:19.012 --> 11:20.580
Why don't you open the door?

11:20.580 --> 11:22.282
It'll be easier if we speak
face-to-face.

11:22.282 --> 11:23.784
Tell them to go away.

11:23.784 --> 11:25.585
Please make them go away.

11:25.585 --> 11:26.519
Wen, please.

11:26.519 --> 11:28.922
Uh, we weren't expecting visitors.

11:28.922 --> 11:31.859
I don't want to sound rude,
but we'd like to be left alone.

11:31.859 --> 11:33.360
I understand.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.328
And I'm sorry to intrude
on your vacation,

11:35.328 --> 11:38.165
especially in such
a beautiful place as this.

11:38.165 --> 11:39.399
Make them go away!

11:39.399 --> 11:41.001
Wen.

11:41.001 --> 11:43.370
You should know that
this isn't easy for us, either.

11:43.370 --> 11:45.839
None of us have been
to this lake before.

11:45.839 --> 11:47.741
And the four of us,
we never thought

11:47.741 --> 11:50.210
we'd be here talking
to you nice people.

11:54.381 --> 11:56.383
Who else is out there with you?

11:56.383 --> 11:58.385
I'm here with Sabrina, Adriane
and Redmond.

11:58.385 --> 11:59.887
And the four of us are here

11:59.887 --> 12:03.490
because we're trying to save
a whole bunch of people.

12:03.490 --> 12:04.958
Eric, come here. Come here.

12:04.958 --> 12:07.160
But we need
your help to do that.

12:07.160 --> 12:09.129
We can't do anything
without you,

12:09.129 --> 12:10.697
and speaking through a door

12:10.697 --> 12:14.001
is making a difficult
conversation near impossible.

12:14.001 --> 12:15.602
What?

12:19.940 --> 12:21.909
There's a woman
carrying something

12:21.909 --> 12:23.610
that looks like a pick
with a chain

12:23.610 --> 12:25.678
and a mallet head at the end.

12:29.216 --> 12:31.184
I'm calling the police now.

12:38.892 --> 12:41.361
This can't be right.
There's no dial tone.

12:41.361 --> 12:43.030
What?

12:43.030 --> 12:44.497
I checked it when we got here.

12:44.497 --> 12:45.966
Is the battery dead?

12:45.966 --> 12:47.567
The battery's not dead.
It's not dialing.

12:48.768 --> 12:52.072
Like I said, we need to talk.

12:52.072 --> 12:53.941
We don't have a choice.

12:55.608 --> 12:57.277
Yeah, well,
we don't have a choice, either!

12:57.277 --> 12:58.645
We're calling the cops!

12:58.645 --> 13:02.415
Hey, um,
we know you can't do that.

13:02.415 --> 13:04.617
None of our phones get service
out here, either.

13:04.617 --> 13:07.921
And sorry,
we had to cut the phone line.

13:14.027 --> 13:17.230
Wen. Wen.
Wen. We-Wen, give me the phone.

13:17.230 --> 13:18.665
We don't mean to rush you,

13:18.665 --> 13:21.734
but we're a little pressed
for time.

13:21.734 --> 13:24.838
Please open the door so we can
have a real conversation.

13:24.838 --> 13:26.907
If you want to talk, then why
do you... -Shh. -Wen, Wen.

13:26.907 --> 13:29.276
...have those scary weapons
with you? -Shh, shh. Wen. Wen.

13:29.276 --> 13:31.111
They're not weapons, Wen.

13:31.111 --> 13:32.779
They're tools.

13:32.779 --> 13:34.347
-
Just open the goddamn door!

13:34.347 --> 13:36.049
We're coming in either way.

13:36.049 --> 13:37.851
The hell you are! I have a gun!

13:38.986 --> 13:40.687
You brought it here?

13:40.687 --> 13:43.190
Yes and no. It's in the safe
in the back of the truck.

13:43.190 --> 13:44.757
He's lying.

13:44.757 --> 13:46.626
Show us what you're packing,
Daddy Andrew!

13:46.626 --> 13:48.061
We all like show-and-tell.

13:48.061 --> 13:49.462
You'll see it when I'm
pointing it at your head,

13:49.462 --> 13:51.031
you piece of crap!

13:51.031 --> 13:52.699
What's wrong with you?
You're not helping.

13:52.699 --> 13:54.134
- You're upsetting him.
- What?

13:54.134 --> 13:55.768
I'm sorry.

13:55.768 --> 14:00.740
Redmond is as anxious
and passionate as we all are.

14:02.809 --> 14:05.845
I'm giving you one last chance
to open the door.

14:18.258 --> 14:19.859
They're breaking in!

14:34.241 --> 14:36.543
Andrew, couch!

14:36.543 --> 14:38.011
Good job, Wen. Keep going.

14:40.380 --> 14:41.748
Push it.

14:44.217 --> 14:45.818
Okay.

14:59.132 --> 15:00.367
Daddy Andrew!

15:08.475 --> 15:10.377
I got you, baby.

15:28.495 --> 15:30.964
They're in the basement.

15:30.964 --> 15:32.966
One is in the back,
one is downstairs.

15:32.966 --> 15:35.702
Let's make a run for it
to the car.

15:35.702 --> 15:37.904
I've got the keys.

15:44.277 --> 15:46.213
It doesn't have to be like this.

15:46.213 --> 15:48.948
Get Wen out of here.

15:57.090 --> 15:59.159
Eric!

15:59.159 --> 16:00.460
Let me help him.

16:00.460 --> 16:01.828
- Wait...
- Don't touch him!

16:01.828 --> 16:03.830
I'm a nurse! He's hurt!

16:05.965 --> 16:09.002
Stop! Stop.

16:14.041 --> 16:15.875
Eric.

16:15.875 --> 16:17.544
Daddy Eric.

16:17.544 --> 16:19.446
Please get up.
We have to go, Daddy.

16:23.283 --> 16:25.285
Eric, wake up.

16:25.285 --> 16:27.554
Wake up, Eric!

16:59.119 --> 17:00.287
Shh.

17:00.287 --> 17:01.954
Shh, you'll be okay.

17:02.755 --> 17:06.326
Andrew, that's enough.

18:10.823 --> 18:14.194
That's my mom
asking how it's going.

18:14.194 --> 18:16.796
Well, you can tell her
you were wrong.

18:18.665 --> 18:20.200
Andrew.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.676
Always together.

18:37.984 --> 18:40.220
- Hi.

18:43.523 --> 18:44.991
Thanks, Custard.

18:44.991 --> 18:48.328
This is a very important
cupcake order.

18:49.796 --> 18:52.532
Let me see if this helps.

18:52.532 --> 18:53.800
Is that better?

18:58.338 --> 19:01.241
Try not to move.

19:01.241 --> 19:02.675
Almost done.

19:02.675 --> 19:04.076
I have to finish

19:04.076 --> 19:06.279
this special order
before tomorrow.

19:06.279 --> 19:09.282
It needs to be purr-fect.

19:10.850 --> 19:13.085
Can you turn that down?

19:13.853 --> 19:15.355
We did when you asked before,

19:15.355 --> 19:17.524
but I'll do it again.

19:22.329 --> 19:23.763
Is Eric cleaned up?

19:23.763 --> 19:27.300
He's cleaned up, yeah,
but severely concussed.

19:31.170 --> 19:32.639
Hey, Eric.

19:33.440 --> 19:35.875
You feeling any better?

19:35.875 --> 19:39.178
I'm... I'm so sorry.

19:41.514 --> 19:44.584
I've never watched this show
before, but-but I like it.

19:44.584 --> 19:47.320
The characters, um,
they seem curious and good.

19:47.320 --> 19:51.090
I get the sense that it
explores or teaches empathy

19:51.090 --> 19:53.693
and tolerance,
and that's just lovely.

19:53.693 --> 19:57.196
Empathy and tolerance?

19:57.196 --> 19:58.898
Is that what you're here
to talk about

19:58.898 --> 20:00.900
now that you have the queers
tied up?

20:00.900 --> 20:02.835
Oh.

20:02.835 --> 20:04.971
Andrew, I assure you
that we're not here

20:04.971 --> 20:07.507
with hate or prejudice
in our hearts. Not at all.

20:07.507 --> 20:10.477
We don't have one
homophobic bone in our bodies.

20:10.477 --> 20:12.245
I don't hate anybody.

20:12.245 --> 20:14.914
I do have conflicted feelings
about this door.

20:16.115 --> 20:18.184
You have to believe that.

20:18.184 --> 20:20.620
But we had no idea
you were a single-sex couple

20:20.620 --> 20:23.390
until we got here.

20:23.390 --> 20:25.292
That one was a surprise.

20:25.292 --> 20:29.028
Well, I guess if you promise,
then I have to believe you.

20:29.829 --> 20:32.265
I mean, we're normal people
just like you.

20:32.265 --> 20:35.335
- We have no choice.
- There's always a choice!

20:36.202 --> 20:38.871
He's right about that.

20:38.871 --> 20:42.375
Our choices make our destiny.

20:42.375 --> 20:45.244
I almost got that tattooed.

20:48.815 --> 20:51.017
Okay, you're right, Andrew.

20:51.017 --> 20:52.652
There's always a choice.

20:52.652 --> 20:55.388
So we choose to be here.

20:55.388 --> 20:58.325
Can everyone come in here, please?

20:58.325 --> 21:00.460
It's almost time.

21:00.460 --> 21:02.395
Time for what?

21:02.395 --> 21:04.497
You don't need us tied up.

21:05.465 --> 21:08.234
You said you were here to talk,
so we'll talk.

21:18.911 --> 21:22.281
Hi, Eric, Wen...

21:23.483 --> 21:26.085
...and Andrew.

21:26.085 --> 21:28.254
My name is Sabrina.

21:28.254 --> 21:31.991
I live in Southern California.

21:31.991 --> 21:34.727
I live in a town
you've probably never heard of.

21:34.727 --> 21:41.000
I have been a post-op nurse
for almost five years.

21:41.000 --> 21:45.237
I used most of my savings

21:45.237 --> 21:47.306
to come out to Pennsylvania,

21:47.306 --> 21:50.877
to come here to talk
with you guys.

21:56.015 --> 21:59.352
I have a little
half sister back home...

22:00.152 --> 22:04.123
...and, Wen,
you kind of remind me of her.

22:14.033 --> 22:15.702
Well, I think you-you guys
already know

22:15.702 --> 22:17.504
my name is Leonard.

22:17.504 --> 22:19.639
And, uh,

22:19.639 --> 22:21.841
I'm good at catching
grasshoppers, right, Wen?

22:27.079 --> 22:28.581
I'm from Chicago.

22:28.581 --> 22:29.849
I'm a second grade teacher,

22:29.849 --> 22:33.520
and I run
the after-school program.

22:33.520 --> 22:35.522
I'm also a bartender. I...

22:35.522 --> 22:37.557
Okay. Me?

22:37.557 --> 22:38.858
Am I next?

22:38.858 --> 22:40.427
Hi there.

22:40.427 --> 22:43.162
I'm Redmond, and I like
long walks on the beach,

22:43.162 --> 22:44.797
- and I like beer.
- Hey.

22:44.797 --> 22:46.198
We already discussed this.

22:46.198 --> 22:48.234
They deserve to know who we are.

22:48.234 --> 22:53.305
We wasted time for this guy
to wake up.

22:53.305 --> 22:56.643
You know, this get-to-know-you
stuff doesn't matter at all.

22:56.643 --> 23:00.647
Doesn't change what we have
to do or what they have to do.

23:00.647 --> 23:05.217
When you say stuff like that,
you sound how you sound,

23:05.217 --> 23:08.020
okay, you just scare them,
you make it less likely

23:08.020 --> 23:10.923
that they'll believe us
or cooperate.

23:10.923 --> 23:14.427
Okay, okay, my turn it is.

23:14.427 --> 23:17.196
I live in Medford, Massachusetts.

23:17.196 --> 23:19.131
I work for the gas company,

23:19.131 --> 23:22.969
making sure houses
and apartments don't blow up.

23:22.969 --> 23:25.938
I'm single,
if you can believe that.

23:27.507 --> 23:31.377
I've done some time,
as they say.

23:32.945 --> 23:36.015
Did a lot of, uh...

23:36.015 --> 23:40.453
questionable stuff
when I was young and stupid.

23:41.821 --> 23:44.356
But I'm much better now.

23:48.761 --> 23:50.763
And my father used to beat
the shit out of me,

23:50.763 --> 23:52.098
like Andrew just did.

23:53.800 --> 23:56.736
Wish I could go back in time,

23:56.736 --> 23:58.938
give the kid-me this thing.

23:58.938 --> 24:01.708
May I speak now?

24:01.708 --> 24:03.342
I hope I don't sound confusing.

24:03.342 --> 24:05.444
Hold on, hold on a second.

24:05.444 --> 24:07.179
Wh...

24:07.179 --> 24:09.549
We get that you guys
are a part of some group

24:09.549 --> 24:13.720
and it sounds like,
it sounds like you want to...

24:13.720 --> 24:15.522
fix things.

24:15.522 --> 24:17.156
To help.

24:17.156 --> 24:18.658
Eric, you don't have
to try to talk...

24:18.658 --> 24:20.459
I... No, no, I'm okay.
I want to say this.

24:20.459 --> 24:24.664
If you're try...
trying to recruit us,

24:24.664 --> 24:26.533
I mean, why else bother

24:26.533 --> 24:29.702
introducing yourselves to us, right?

24:29.702 --> 24:36.042
If you're trying to change us
or make us different,

24:36.042 --> 24:38.878
all of this...

24:38.878 --> 24:41.280
this isn't the way.

24:43.149 --> 24:45.284
Can someone put the curtain
on the back door?

24:45.284 --> 24:46.853
What's wrong with Eric?

24:46.853 --> 24:48.154
When you have a concussion,

24:48.154 --> 24:49.689
you're extremely sensitive
to light.

24:49.689 --> 24:51.323
Well, there-there's nothing
we can do about that now.

24:51.323 --> 24:52.825
Well, he's only gonna
get better if he rests

24:52.825 --> 24:54.594
in a darkened room
or if we make it dark in here.

24:54.594 --> 24:56.295
We shouldn't move him
until we make our proposal.

24:56.295 --> 24:57.730
He might need to be
in a darkened room for days,

24:57.730 --> 24:59.799
- not just a few hours.
- You're not separating me

24:59.799 --> 25:01.167
from Andrew and Wen.

25:01.167 --> 25:03.570
I'll see what I can do
with the curtains.

25:03.570 --> 25:04.904
So, whatever.

25:04.904 --> 25:07.874
I'm, um, I'm Adriane.

25:07.874 --> 25:10.643
Yeah, I-I've been a lot
of things, but-but right now,

25:10.643 --> 25:14.647
or, um, before I got up here,
I-I was a line cook

25:14.647 --> 25:19.185
at a Mexican restaurant
in-in Dupont Circle, D.C.

25:19.986 --> 25:22.021
I love to feed people.

25:22.021 --> 25:24.824
It feels like it's more
than food to me.

25:24.824 --> 25:27.459
Um, God, what else?

25:27.459 --> 25:28.928
Uh...

25:28.928 --> 25:31.964
Oh, I have, um, I have two cats.

25:31.964 --> 25:33.499
And you'd love them, Wen.

25:33.499 --> 25:37.069
Their names are Riff and Raff.

25:37.069 --> 25:39.138
Do you like cats, Wen?

25:39.138 --> 25:41.708
You don't have to answer her, sweetie.

25:41.708 --> 25:43.409
Sorry, Wen.

25:43.409 --> 25:45.277
Maybe I'll put it back on
later, okay?

25:45.277 --> 25:47.980
Forget the curtains.

25:47.980 --> 25:50.016
It's time.

26:05.031 --> 26:08.901
The four of us are here
to prevent the apocalypse.

26:10.069 --> 26:13.305
We-- and when I say "we,"
I mean everyone in this cabin--

26:13.305 --> 26:17.143
can stop it from happening,
but only with your help.

26:19.445 --> 26:23.382
Ultimately,
whether the world ends or not

26:23.382 --> 26:26.719
is completely up to you three.

26:27.854 --> 26:31.423
You are having a psychological
break of some kind.

26:40.499 --> 26:43.703
Your family must choose
to willingly sacrifice

26:43.703 --> 26:45.071
one of the three of you

26:45.071 --> 26:47.674
in order to prevent
the apocalypse.

26:50.777 --> 26:54.714
After you make what I know
is an impossible decision,

26:54.714 --> 26:57.549
you must then kill
the one you choose.

27:00.820 --> 27:03.289
If you fail to choose,

27:03.289 --> 27:07.660
or if you fail to follow through
with the sacrifice,

27:07.660 --> 27:10.096
the world will end.

27:10.096 --> 27:13.465
You three will live,

27:13.465 --> 27:16.168
but the rest of humanity,

27:16.168 --> 27:21.040
seven billion plus...

27:21.040 --> 27:22.541
will perish.

27:25.978 --> 27:27.546
They're lunatics.

27:28.614 --> 27:30.449
And you will all live
long enough

27:30.449 --> 27:34.687
to witness the horror
of the end of everything.

27:34.687 --> 27:39.826
And you will be left to wander
the devastated planet alone.

27:41.427 --> 27:46.265
Permanently
and cosmically... alone.

27:47.734 --> 27:50.436
Leonard.

27:51.270 --> 27:53.539
We haven't done anything wrong.

27:53.539 --> 27:55.274
I agree with you. You haven't.

27:55.274 --> 27:59.611
You haven't done anything wrong
to... to deserve this burden.

28:03.115 --> 28:07.386
You're just the family chosen
to decide for us in this time.

28:17.563 --> 28:19.832
Look,
we're not here to hurt you.

28:19.832 --> 28:22.334
If we wanted to hurt you,
we would've used duct tape

28:22.334 --> 28:24.871
- instead of ropes.
- You stop.

28:27.206 --> 28:28.875
You have to understand
that we cannot

28:28.875 --> 28:31.944
and will not choose who has
to be sacrificed for you.

28:31.944 --> 28:35.681
And just as importantly,
we cannot act for you.

28:35.681 --> 28:37.716
And you cannot kill yourselves.

28:38.650 --> 28:40.619
We're not choosing anyone.

28:40.619 --> 28:42.721
We're not sacrificing anyone.

28:42.721 --> 28:44.590
Not now, not ever.

28:44.590 --> 28:47.559
Even if it means the death
of everyone else in the world?

28:47.559 --> 28:49.728
Yes. Even if I believe
the world was at stake,

28:49.728 --> 28:53.099
which I don't,
that's what it means.

28:53.099 --> 28:54.767
I would watch the world die
a hundred times over

28:54.767 --> 28:57.203
- before having to...
- Christ.

28:57.203 --> 28:59.205
Waste of time.

28:59.205 --> 29:02.408
They're never gonna choose
to do this.

29:02.408 --> 29:04.410
And I don't blame them.

29:04.410 --> 29:06.578
- Who would ever choose...
- Shut up, Redmond.

29:06.578 --> 29:09.348
You just vomit
everything you think.

29:09.348 --> 29:11.851
Oh, God, we are so screwed.

29:11.851 --> 29:13.685
Okay,

29:13.685 --> 29:16.488
you need to listen
to this part, too.

29:16.488 --> 29:18.224
I've been shown exactly
what will happen

29:18.224 --> 29:20.326
if you choose not to make
a sacrifice.

29:20.326 --> 29:22.594
We've all been shown.

29:22.594 --> 29:25.798
We couldn't stop drawing
the visions we saw.

29:25.798 --> 29:30.002
I actually thought
something was wrong with me,

29:30.002 --> 29:31.938
but the visions were so strong,

29:31.938 --> 29:35.808
so specific and so, so real.

29:35.808 --> 29:38.477
Sabrina, Adriane and Redmond,
they had the visions, too.

29:38.477 --> 29:43.315
So, that led us
to each other and...

29:43.315 --> 29:46.685
and that led us here
to this exact cabin.

29:46.685 --> 29:50.222
We have no idea
why we were picked.

29:59.465 --> 30:01.633
First, the cities will drown.

30:01.633 --> 30:06.238
The oceans will swell
and rise up into a great fist

30:06.238 --> 30:09.275
and pound all the buildings
and people into the sand,

30:09.275 --> 30:10.776
and drag everything out to sea.

30:10.776 --> 30:12.644
There is something
wrong with you,

30:12.644 --> 30:15.781
with all of you,
if you believe this.

30:15.781 --> 30:18.417
Then a terrible plague
will descend

30:18.417 --> 30:19.751
and people will writhe
with fever,

30:19.751 --> 30:21.520
and mucus will fill their lungs.

30:21.520 --> 30:22.922
This is psychotic.

30:22.922 --> 30:24.924
It's delusional.

30:24.924 --> 30:26.292
Did you try to get help?

30:26.292 --> 30:28.360
Let us go
and we'll get you help.

30:28.360 --> 30:30.029
The skies will fall
and crash to the earth

30:30.029 --> 30:31.663
like pieces of glass.

30:31.663 --> 30:34.133
And God's fingers
will scorch the earth

30:34.133 --> 30:36.668
and an everlasting darkness
will descend over humanity.

30:36.668 --> 30:39.005
You need help!

30:42.909 --> 30:45.077
This is going to happen.

30:46.412 --> 30:49.781
And we've been shown that only
your sacrifice can stop it.

30:49.781 --> 30:51.050
Shown by who?

30:51.050 --> 30:52.384
By what?

30:52.384 --> 30:53.920
Are you gonna answer that?

30:53.920 --> 30:55.554
You sound like every
fake doomsdayer

30:55.554 --> 30:58.490
on every corner of every city.

31:02.661 --> 31:06.933
Come on, talk to us.

31:06.933 --> 31:11.570
Dreams can have
many different meanings.

31:12.438 --> 31:15.841
Our part in your visions
is kind of vague.

31:15.841 --> 31:19.245
Almost like you didn't know
who would be here.

31:19.245 --> 31:21.680
Like it was random.

31:22.982 --> 31:24.583
It doesn't make sense.

31:25.417 --> 31:28.487
For every "no" you give us,

31:28.487 --> 31:32.624
we will unleash a plague
for the sins of humanity.

31:36.195 --> 31:38.497
Will you make a choice?

32:07.126 --> 32:10.296
Wait, stop.

32:10.296 --> 32:12.264
You don't need to do this.

32:12.264 --> 32:13.465
You don't need those things.

32:13.465 --> 32:15.467
You said you couldn't hurt us.

32:17.236 --> 32:19.205
What are you doing?

32:25.377 --> 32:26.912
What are you doing?
Don't touch her.

32:26.912 --> 32:30.249
Don't touch her!
Get off her, get off her!

32:30.249 --> 32:32.684
Get off of her!

32:34.453 --> 32:37.323
Wen, Wen.

32:37.323 --> 32:39.225
Run, Wen. Wen.

32:39.225 --> 32:40.559
I can't.

32:40.559 --> 32:42.728
Run.

32:50.169 --> 32:53.839
Please, God, just let us go.

33:07.919 --> 33:10.022
Fuck.

33:10.022 --> 33:11.823
I'm scared.

33:13.759 --> 33:16.128
Keep looking at me, okay?

33:17.829 --> 33:21.100
Don't you fucking look away
from me.

33:59.905 --> 34:03.909
A part of humanity
has been judged.

34:08.447 --> 34:10.149
Whatever it is you're
convinced of, it isn't real.

34:10.149 --> 34:11.817
- You don't have to do this.
- This isn't real.

34:11.817 --> 34:13.719
- It's not gonna... No!

34:57.963 --> 35:00.866
You can pray if you want.
I won't make comment.

35:09.941 --> 35:11.877
Mr. and Mrs. Brooks?

35:11.877 --> 35:14.213
Yes. My wife couldn't
be here today.

35:14.213 --> 35:16.014
This is her brother.

35:42.073 --> 35:44.610
Now tell me
this isn't a miracle.

35:48.547 --> 35:51.016
Hi. Hi, Daddy.

35:51.016 --> 35:52.684
Hi, Wen.

35:52.684 --> 35:54.886
- Hey.

35:54.886 --> 35:56.455
- Oh.
-  Oh.

36:23.949 --> 36:25.284
Adriane,

36:25.284 --> 36:27.553
can you help me out here?

36:27.553 --> 36:30.055
- Adriane.
- Hey, yeah.

36:30.055 --> 36:31.089
What?

36:31.089 --> 36:33.659
Help me take Redmond outside.

36:35.126 --> 36:37.329
We'll cover him with a blanket.

37:31.517 --> 37:33.719
Wen, I'm sorry, but I'm gonna
have to change the channel

37:33.719 --> 37:34.886
for a little bit, okay?

37:34.886 --> 37:36.355
Go fuck yourself, Mister Rogers.

37:36.355 --> 37:38.924
I want you
to try a piece of this.

37:38.924 --> 37:40.992
I want to see whether
the air fryer oven

37:40.992 --> 37:43.995
- makes it just as crispy...
- Please watch the TV.

37:43.995 --> 37:45.597
- It should be on soon.
- I'm not even gonna kid you,

37:45.597 --> 37:47.399
I really just want this.

37:47.399 --> 37:50.201
-Do you hear
that gorgeous crispy crunch?

37:50.201 --> 37:52.103
-Doesn't get
much better than that.

37:52.103 --> 37:53.705
Mmm.

37:53.705 --> 37:55.206
And it tastes amazing.

37:55.206 --> 37:57.943
Amazing fried chicken
and a lot less guilt.

38:01.913 --> 38:03.815
We continue with our coverage
of the earthquake

38:03.815 --> 38:05.951
centered in
the Aleutian Islands,

38:05.951 --> 38:07.919
which struck more than
four hours ago.

38:07.919 --> 38:10.021
The U.S. National Tsunami
Warning Center

38:10.021 --> 38:13.124
has issued a cautionary advisory
to British Columbia,

38:13.124 --> 38:15.794
Canada, and more than
a thousand miles of coast

38:15.794 --> 38:17.829
along the
American Pacific Northwest,

38:17.829 --> 38:20.732
including the cities
of Seattle and Portland.

38:20.732 --> 38:22.267
The Pacific Tsunami
Warning Center

38:22.267 --> 38:25.404
issued its strongest warning
to the islands of Hawaii.

38:25.404 --> 38:27.305
Is this what we're supposed
to see?

38:27.305 --> 38:28.940
...high schools, malls
and colleges, campuses...

38:28.940 --> 38:30.476
I explained to you
what would happen

38:30.476 --> 38:31.877
as a result of you not choosing.

38:31.877 --> 38:33.645
A plague will be released
by Redmond's death.

38:33.645 --> 38:35.080
You have to listen to me.

38:35.080 --> 38:36.348
I remember,
but this doesn't mean anything.

38:36.348 --> 38:37.516
- It doesn't mean...
- No!

38:37.516 --> 38:39.317
Just watch!

38:41.387 --> 38:43.755
I know I shouldn't yell.

38:43.755 --> 38:45.457
I know you're afraid of me,
of us.

38:45.457 --> 38:47.359
Just... please watch.

38:47.359 --> 38:48.960
...points to a sizable wave

38:48.960 --> 38:50.562
of 15 to 20 feet in height

38:50.562 --> 38:52.864
headed south towards
the Hawaiian Islands.

38:52.864 --> 38:56.568
We do have information that
the tsunami has made landfall.

38:56.568 --> 38:58.670
Now, as you can tell
from our live feed,

38:58.670 --> 39:02.140
this resort on Kauai
has already been evacuated.

39:09.280 --> 39:11.182
Our early warning
detection systems

39:11.182 --> 39:13.552
gave plenty of time
to evacuate the coasts

39:13.552 --> 39:16.254
and low-laying areas at
the affected Hawaiian Islands.

39:16.254 --> 39:17.923
No injuries or fatalities
have been reported.

39:17.923 --> 39:19.791
Please let Eric
and Wen go at least.

39:19.791 --> 39:22.093
Eric has a concussion.

39:24.295 --> 39:26.197
I'll stay.

39:26.197 --> 39:28.700
And we can talk about doomsday,
or the apocalypse,

39:28.700 --> 39:31.002
or mass traumatic events of
the 21st century all you want.

39:31.002 --> 39:32.771
I don't understand,
this isn't the...

39:32.771 --> 39:35.974
Sabrina, just keep watching.

39:35.974 --> 39:38.343
Until we see what was shown
to us.

39:44.416 --> 39:46.284
A second massive earthquake

39:46.284 --> 39:48.019
has struck in the Pacific,

39:48.019 --> 39:49.721
registering 8.6
on the Richter scale.

39:49.721 --> 39:53.291
The epicenter is only 70 miles
off the coast of Oregon

39:53.291 --> 39:56.227
in what's called
the Cascadia Subduction Zone.

39:56.227 --> 39:58.129
That's an area scientists
have long feared

39:58.129 --> 40:01.533
would produce
a catastrophic earthquake.

40:02.534 --> 40:03.969
Unbelievable.

40:03.969 --> 40:05.971
There it is.

40:05.971 --> 40:08.106
We did this.

40:08.106 --> 40:10.942
It's really fucking happening.

40:11.843 --> 40:15.146
Oh, Jesus, God.

40:15.146 --> 40:17.082
...and given the proximity
of the epicenter,

40:17.082 --> 40:20.018
people on the coast
are gonna have mere minutes

40:20.018 --> 40:21.453
to try to find shelter.

40:21.453 --> 40:24.656
A tsunami triggered by a quake
of this magnitude

40:24.656 --> 40:28.794
and proximity to the shoreline
will be massive.

40:28.794 --> 40:30.629
I-I mean, 50-foot-high bluffs

40:30.629 --> 40:33.198
along the coast
are not gonna be safe.

40:33.198 --> 40:34.666
And we've just gotten word.

40:34.666 --> 40:37.168
The tsunami has indeed hit
the Oregon shoreline

40:37.168 --> 40:41.239
and we have footage shot
minutes ago from Cannon Beach.

40:43.475 --> 40:45.677
Holy crap, this is what I saw.

40:45.677 --> 40:48.847
The same jutting rocks.

40:48.847 --> 40:50.816
Me, too.

41:32.524 --> 41:34.159
Wen,

41:34.159 --> 41:36.795
go to your room
till I tell you to come out.

41:52.043 --> 41:54.680
She didn't need to see this.

41:54.680 --> 41:57.583
Tomorrow morning,
you can make the difficult,

41:57.583 --> 42:01.219
selfless choice of sacrifice
and save the world...

42:02.353 --> 42:04.723
...or you can choose once again

42:04.723 --> 42:06.692
to let the clock move
another minute closer

42:06.692 --> 42:09.127
to permanent midnight.

42:12.163 --> 42:14.399
For the rest of today
and tonight,

42:14.399 --> 42:17.636
we'll tend to your needs
within reason.

42:17.636 --> 42:19.871
But otherwise,

42:19.871 --> 42:22.608
we'll leave you be to reflect...

42:22.608 --> 42:24.910
and talk it over.

42:24.910 --> 42:26.411
We told you.

42:26.411 --> 42:27.913
You have to believe us.

42:27.913 --> 42:29.948
It doesn't matter if we believe
your craziness.

42:29.948 --> 42:32.483
The answer is still the same.

42:32.483 --> 42:35.253
Everyone in the world can die,
as far as we're concerned.

42:35.253 --> 42:37.322
Am I right, Eric?

42:39.958 --> 42:41.526
Eric?

42:42.894 --> 42:45.063
You okay?

42:45.063 --> 42:47.599
I'm okay.

42:50.168 --> 42:52.671
I just need a moment.

42:55.340 --> 42:56.742
I have a little surprise

42:56.742 --> 42:58.376
- queued up for you.
- Ooh. Oh, a surprise.

42:58.376 --> 42:59.945
- Ooh, what's that gonna be?
- Are you ready?

43:01.613 --> 43:04.349
- Oh! -Oh!
- Yeah!

43:04.349 --> 43:05.984
- Are we gonna sing along?
- Yes, of course.

43:05.984 --> 43:08.286
- I think, I think we are.
- I don't know, I don't know.

being further away

43:59.771 --> 44:02.774
than we thought,
I'm officially impressed.

44:02.774 --> 44:04.575
Okay.

44:04.575 --> 44:07.145
- Hey, Wen, come get your bag.
- Wen?

44:07.145 --> 44:09.180
Wen, come on.

44:09.180 --> 44:11.182
Wen, come check out the view.

44:11.182 --> 44:13.451
It's better than the website.

44:15.520 --> 44:17.823
How many grasshoppers
did you catch?

44:17.823 --> 44:19.725
Just one so far.

44:19.725 --> 44:20.926
Her name's Liv.

44:20.926 --> 44:22.227
Oh. You see any bears yet?

44:22.227 --> 44:24.029
Andrew, don't start.

44:24.029 --> 44:25.831
If we joke about it,
she won't take it seriously.

44:25.831 --> 44:28.633
We won't leave the garbage out,
we'll be fine.

44:28.633 --> 44:33.204
Wen, show Daddy Eric
your scary bear face.

44:36.541 --> 44:38.409
- Wen, run from... Run.

44:38.409 --> 44:39.778
Hey, Wenling, sweetie,
not too close.

44:39.778 --> 44:41.312
That dock might have
rusty nails.

44:41.312 --> 44:42.513
Eric, come on
with your rusty nails.

44:42.513 --> 44:44.249
We got so lucky with this place.

44:44.249 --> 44:45.683
Whoo!

44:45.683 --> 44:47.485
- Get in!

44:47.485 --> 44:49.620
- Come on, Wen!

44:50.421 --> 44:52.423
- Come on!
- Oh.

44:52.423 --> 44:54.659
- Whoo!

44:54.659 --> 44:56.661
Whoa!

44:57.729 --> 44:59.865
- Here I come!
- Eric, come!

44:59.865 --> 45:01.166
He's coming in!

45:01.166 --> 45:02.367
Oh, come on.

45:02.367 --> 45:05.070
Hold on, one second, one second.

45:05.070 --> 45:06.772
- Woo-hoo!
- Coming right at you.

45:06.772 --> 45:08.473
- Here I come.
- Yes, yes, yes!

45:13.078 --> 45:15.113
Oh. Oh, it's a cold spot.

45:15.113 --> 45:17.215
Look at you swimming.

45:20.351 --> 45:22.353
Just applying a little pressure.

45:24.355 --> 45:26.524
Told you I'm a nurse.

45:26.524 --> 45:27.926
You may not be on board

45:27.926 --> 45:29.928
with all the
"end of the world" stuff yet,

45:29.928 --> 45:32.497
but at least trust me on that.

45:32.497 --> 45:34.732
None of us wanted it
to go this way.

45:34.732 --> 45:37.502
We need you
in a clear state of mind.

45:37.502 --> 45:40.538
You've got a big decision
to make.

45:42.573 --> 45:46.477
You think I'm some kind
of religious freak, right?

45:47.445 --> 45:49.815
I would, too.

45:49.815 --> 45:51.616
Truth is,
I haven't even been to church

45:51.616 --> 45:55.053
since my grandma forced me to go
when I was little.

45:55.053 --> 45:58.156
I always thought religious stuff
was so tired and boring

45:58.156 --> 46:02.493
from another time, and people
were scared of shadows.

46:06.231 --> 46:08.766
Then the visions started.

46:12.737 --> 46:15.573
I didn't believe it at first, either.

46:17.208 --> 46:19.577
But you will.

46:24.349 --> 46:27.652
When I was a kid,
my dad used to say to me,

46:27.652 --> 46:31.422
"Trust in something
more than you."

46:33.091 --> 46:38.396
It's sort of become my mantra
these past few days.

46:39.197 --> 46:41.699
I said it
when I saw the visions.

46:41.699 --> 46:43.869
I said it when I built my weapon

46:43.869 --> 46:45.971
exactly the way
it was shown to me.

46:45.971 --> 46:47.605
I said it over and over

46:47.605 --> 46:51.409
as I passed every freeway exit
on my way here.

46:53.211 --> 46:55.646
I said it when I walked out
onto the boardwalk

46:55.646 --> 46:57.949
and I saw the others.

46:58.749 --> 47:02.520
We were all wearing the same
colors we saw in our visions.

47:02.520 --> 47:05.523
That's when I knew
I wasn't alone.

47:07.658 --> 47:09.995
And all of this...

47:12.463 --> 47:14.765
...is real.

47:16.935 --> 47:19.670
And I'm saying it
to you now, Eric,

47:19.670 --> 47:21.439
you need to trust something
more than you.

47:21.439 --> 47:25.977
You may not want to believe it,
but we're all on the same side.

47:28.246 --> 47:30.882
I'm on my family's side.

48:06.617 --> 48:09.220
Eric?

48:09.220 --> 48:11.389
You really okay?

48:12.457 --> 48:15.693
My head's still ringing,
but my vision is clearer.

48:24.802 --> 48:26.304
You know that first
earthquake happened

48:26.304 --> 48:28.139
a whole four hours ago, right?

48:28.139 --> 48:29.975
Before they showed up here.

48:29.975 --> 48:32.243
Leonard's checked his watch
a thousand times.

48:32.243 --> 48:34.612
They've been timing all of this.

48:35.413 --> 48:36.381
I know.

48:42.420 --> 48:44.489
I just don't want you to...

48:46.724 --> 48:48.559
I don't want you to be spooked
or anything.

48:48.559 --> 48:50.261
You think I believe them?

48:50.261 --> 48:51.696
No.

48:53.564 --> 48:56.334
No, it's just...

48:56.334 --> 48:57.735
With your head and all,

48:57.735 --> 48:59.337
I want to make sure
you're thinking straight.

48:59.337 --> 49:01.606
Without them trying
to manipulate us.

49:01.606 --> 49:05.076
They take you alone in there
and try and talk to you.

49:05.076 --> 49:07.678
I don't believe them.

49:12.417 --> 49:14.452
I'm trying to keep it together.

49:14.452 --> 49:15.686
This isn't gonna work.

49:15.686 --> 49:17.322
They're never gonna
believe us, man.

49:17.322 --> 49:19.290
We have to believe
in what we're doing,

49:19.290 --> 49:20.791
what our goal is here.

49:20.791 --> 49:23.661
Did you see
Redmond's fucking face?

49:23.661 --> 49:25.330
It was just crazy.

49:25.330 --> 49:27.565
Say whatever it is
you have to say to them.

49:27.565 --> 49:29.300
Convince them.

49:53.858 --> 49:56.461
- Wen!

50:00.298 --> 50:01.966
Wen!

50:07.438 --> 50:09.474
Wen!

50:14.145 --> 50:16.114
Wen!

50:41.106 --> 50:42.540
Whoa!

50:52.950 --> 50:56.121
I'm afraid the rule is
that no one's allowed to leave.

50:57.488 --> 50:58.989
Were you trying to escape, Wen?

50:58.989 --> 51:01.292
Leave her alone.

51:01.292 --> 51:03.561
I told her to do it.

51:03.561 --> 51:06.431
You're just scared, Wen.

51:06.431 --> 51:07.965
We all are.

51:07.965 --> 51:11.035
You'll ask us to choose again.

51:11.035 --> 51:13.204
Don't listen to them, Wen.

51:15.039 --> 51:17.508
We were targeted.

51:18.643 --> 51:21.078
We've always
been targeted. We...

51:21.078 --> 51:22.580
- Andrew!

51:27.885 --> 51:30.521
I knew I recognized him.

51:37.462 --> 51:39.564
Redmond...

51:39.564 --> 51:41.199
is the guy from the bar.

51:41.199 --> 51:43.234
What?

51:43.234 --> 51:44.469
Are you sure?

51:44.469 --> 51:46.737
What guy from the bar?

51:46.737 --> 51:49.740
Andrew was attacked by a man in
a bar in Boston many years ago.

51:49.740 --> 51:51.842
The man went to jail
for a short while.

51:51.842 --> 51:53.344
But his name was O'Bannon.

51:53.344 --> 51:54.779
It's him.

51:54.779 --> 51:56.181
He's gained weight
and his beard's different,

51:56.181 --> 51:57.648
but it's him.

51:58.416 --> 51:59.950
His name was Redmond.

51:59.950 --> 52:02.520
We don't know dick about him, Leonard.

52:02.520 --> 52:05.122
We all met him for the
first time on that boardwalk.

52:05.122 --> 52:06.724
Stop the bullshit!

52:06.724 --> 52:07.958
This is all some kind
of sick scam

52:07.958 --> 52:09.360
to get us to hurt each other.

52:09.360 --> 52:10.828
That's not true.

52:10.828 --> 52:12.230
We don't know
why each of us is here.

52:12.230 --> 52:13.998
It's a coincidence
the man who attacked me

52:13.998 --> 52:16.301
and had me in years of therapy
is one of your group?

52:16.301 --> 52:17.768
Go get his wallet.

52:17.768 --> 52:20.638
I'll show you his name
isn't Redmond.

52:21.439 --> 52:22.607
No, we're not doing that.

52:22.607 --> 52:24.642
Why?!

52:25.743 --> 52:28.446
Because it doesn't matter
what his name is.

52:28.446 --> 52:30.448
Okay? We all had the visions.

52:30.448 --> 52:31.849
This has to be exact.

52:31.849 --> 52:34.619
Everything has to be right.

52:34.619 --> 52:36.086
Didn't he tell us
about this cabin

52:36.086 --> 52:37.722
on the message board first?

52:37.722 --> 52:39.023
And then we all had visions
of the cabin?

52:39.023 --> 52:40.425
I don't know. It...

52:40.425 --> 52:42.493
No, we had the visions first.

52:42.493 --> 52:44.128
Message board?

52:47.765 --> 52:50.034
Look, we're not doubting
why we're here.

52:53.504 --> 52:55.540
Go to sleep.

52:55.540 --> 52:57.208
The sun will rise,

52:57.208 --> 52:59.910
maybe for the last time
for all of us.

52:59.910 --> 53:02.380
The premise of your scam
is flawed.

53:03.281 --> 53:05.850
I'm a human rights attorney, Leonard.

53:05.850 --> 53:07.418
How about I show you
photos of kids

53:07.418 --> 53:11.021
who have been tortured
and killed, lying in piles?

53:11.021 --> 53:12.823
You want to make a case
for humanity to go on,

53:12.823 --> 53:14.625
you're gonna lose.

53:23.301 --> 53:27.104
This is a picture of some
of the kids I coach.

53:27.104 --> 53:30.541
This year, the boys had
a record of three and eight.

53:30.541 --> 53:33.411
The girls, five and six.

53:33.411 --> 53:35.680
So, we're not very good.

53:35.680 --> 53:40.585
If you could hear them laugh,
you'd understand why I'm here.

53:41.386 --> 53:44.722
Maybe you'd sleep better if you
could see each other easier.

an egg great,

54:37.708 --> 54:39.977
Eric.

54:39.977 --> 54:44.214
My hands are a little looser.

55:24.555 --> 55:26.991
you guys met on some kind
of message board, right?

55:26.991 --> 55:28.993
You're having a shared delusion.

55:28.993 --> 55:31.328
That's a uniquely 21st-century
health crisis.

55:31.328 --> 55:32.730
It is real.

55:32.730 --> 55:35.065
You're in an echo chamber,
you know that, right?

55:35.933 --> 55:38.703
You got online,
and you found random people

55:38.703 --> 55:42.172
who had random visions
and you took that as evidence.

55:42.172 --> 55:43.874
Remember the guy
who shot up three people

55:43.874 --> 55:45.275
in an Army base in Louisiana?

55:45.275 --> 55:47.077
He was part of an online group
like yours.

55:47.077 --> 55:49.279
They posted videos about
how the shadow government

55:49.279 --> 55:52.016
was stalking them
and using mind control weapons

55:52.016 --> 55:54.652
in an attempt to destroy
their lives.

55:55.420 --> 55:56.887
We found each other online

55:56.887 --> 55:58.656
because we said
we had the same visions.

55:58.656 --> 56:00.525
Remember what
you did at Thanksgiving?

56:00.525 --> 56:03.561
And then we decided
to meet on the boardwalk.

56:03.561 --> 56:06.564
You're gonna do that if I nod.

56:06.564 --> 56:09.099
Okay, let's continue.

56:21.446 --> 56:24.915
You have the opportunity
to choose.

56:27.785 --> 56:29.253
I don't mean to rush you,

56:29.253 --> 56:33.090
but we're gonna ask for your
decisions very fast now.

56:35.593 --> 56:37.327
I'm gonna be straight up.

56:40.064 --> 56:41.799
I'm the next one to go.

56:44.001 --> 56:45.703
I'm counting on you, man.

56:45.703 --> 56:48.506
You're, like, my last hope here.

56:48.506 --> 56:50.140
Adriane,

56:50.140 --> 56:52.510
you can walk out of here
right now.

56:52.510 --> 56:55.446
Just walk out and see,
nothing will happen.

56:55.446 --> 56:57.715
None of this can stop
until you make a choice.

56:57.715 --> 56:58.949
Don't you get that already?

57:01.051 --> 57:03.220
You think I want to be here?

57:03.220 --> 57:05.490
I'm just some fucking cook.

57:06.857 --> 57:08.526
I didn't tell you at first,

57:08.526 --> 57:11.428
but I have a son.

57:11.428 --> 57:13.531
I didn't want to speak
his name, but...

57:13.531 --> 57:16.200
here I am, begging you to do
what has to be done

57:16.200 --> 57:19.236
because if you don't,
my son is gonna die.

57:20.370 --> 57:22.807
Over the last few days,
I've had to watch him die

57:22.807 --> 57:24.609
over and over and over again.

57:24.609 --> 57:27.111
I've watched my little boy
burned alive

57:27.111 --> 57:29.547
as I held him in my arms.

57:30.347 --> 57:31.882
Everything was burning.

57:31.882 --> 57:35.052
I can't get the sound
of his screams out of my head,

57:35.052 --> 57:37.187
even right now, so...

57:37.187 --> 57:40.658
as a mother, believe me
when I tell you

57:40.658 --> 57:42.993
that this is really happening.

57:44.529 --> 57:45.963
And it's up to you.

57:45.963 --> 57:47.865
What exactly did you guys see?

57:47.865 --> 57:50.568
Stop talking to him.

57:50.568 --> 57:52.837
He doesn't believe you.

57:52.837 --> 57:55.039
None of us believe you.

57:55.039 --> 57:57.074
Let your time run out.

57:57.074 --> 58:00.210
We're not gonna do
what you want us to do.

58:07.284 --> 58:10.087
His name is Charlie.

58:13.223 --> 58:15.526
He likes pancakes.

58:37.615 --> 58:39.249
Very well.

58:41.586 --> 58:44.989
Close your eyes
and cover your ears.

58:46.891 --> 58:48.959
You don't have to do this.

58:48.959 --> 58:50.327
You guys are delusional.

58:50.327 --> 58:51.862
You are part of a suicide cult.

58:51.862 --> 58:53.731
Can't you see that?

59:01.572 --> 59:02.940
Stop!

59:02.940 --> 59:04.909
Please stop this!

59:41.545 --> 59:45.049
A part of humanity
has been judged.

1:00:08.338 --> 1:00:10.074
I'll move her
into the other room

1:00:10.074 --> 1:00:11.876
so they don't have to see her.

1:00:30.627 --> 1:00:33.563
Hundreds of thousands of people
are going to die now.

1:00:34.965 --> 1:00:37.668
We've unleashed a second plague.

1:00:39.937 --> 1:00:41.739
Bullshit.

1:00:43.908 --> 1:00:46.510
Sabrina, put on the TV, please.

1:00:54.651 --> 1:00:56.420
There have also been
new developments

1:00:56.420 --> 1:00:58.322
with the novel X-Nine virus,

1:00:58.322 --> 1:01:01.826
which is proving particularly
fatal to children.

1:01:01.826 --> 1:01:04.094
The X-Nine virus
is highly transmittable

1:01:04.094 --> 1:01:06.630
amongst children
aged ten and under.

1:01:06.630 --> 1:01:08.632
These outbreaks seem
to be originating

1:01:08.632 --> 1:01:11.869
in three distinct pockets
of the world:

1:01:11.869 --> 1:01:13.704
Cape Town, Suffolk, England,

1:01:13.704 --> 1:01:16.573
and outside Nashville
in Tennessee.

1:01:16.573 --> 1:01:19.243
Lockdowns in these areas
have already begun

1:01:19.243 --> 1:01:21.145
as numbers rise along with fear

1:01:21.145 --> 1:01:23.347
for the safety
of those infected.

1:01:23.347 --> 1:01:25.816
Numerous public schools
have been suspended

1:01:25.816 --> 1:01:27.184
with some being converted

1:01:27.184 --> 1:01:29.887
into makeshift
quarantine facilities.

1:01:29.887 --> 1:01:32.356
While there is hope that
the virus will be contained

1:01:32.356 --> 1:01:33.758
to the geographical pockets
in question...

1:01:33.758 --> 1:01:35.692
I think
I saw something, Andrew.

1:01:35.692 --> 1:01:37.661
...these communities
are trapped in lockdown.

1:01:37.661 --> 1:01:39.163
What?

1:01:39.163 --> 1:01:40.798
What are you saying?

1:01:40.798 --> 1:01:42.699
I think I saw a person.

1:01:42.699 --> 1:01:45.202
Or a figure.

1:01:45.202 --> 1:01:47.537
Turn the TV off.

1:01:48.572 --> 1:01:51.275
Where'd you see a figure?

1:01:52.109 --> 1:01:54.044
In the light behind you.

1:01:54.044 --> 1:01:56.446
In the reflection in the mirror.

1:01:57.247 --> 1:01:59.649
When you were standing
behind Redmond.

1:01:59.649 --> 1:02:01.819
Right before you struck him.

1:02:03.120 --> 1:02:05.689
Eric, look at me.

1:02:07.457 --> 1:02:09.359
You have a severe concussion.

1:02:09.359 --> 1:02:10.761
She even told you

1:02:10.761 --> 1:02:12.296
you would be extremely
sensitive to light.

1:02:12.296 --> 1:02:15.465
We're under extreme stress here.

1:02:15.465 --> 1:02:18.035
I need you to listen
to the words I'm saying.

1:02:18.035 --> 1:02:20.637
Breathe in for a second, okay?

1:02:26.043 --> 1:02:28.312
I've been reading about
these X-Nine cases

1:02:28.312 --> 1:02:30.380
for months already,
you know that.

1:02:30.380 --> 1:02:32.917
It isn't a fucking plague.

1:02:32.917 --> 1:02:34.684
It's a news report.

1:02:34.684 --> 1:02:37.021
They all knew about it
before they showed up here

1:02:37.021 --> 1:02:39.689
and knowingly made it
a part of their narrative.

1:02:39.689 --> 1:02:43.327
And this guy has been checking
his watch all morning

1:02:43.327 --> 1:02:44.862
just like yesterday.

1:02:44.862 --> 1:02:46.630
- Come on, Andrew.
- All four of you have watches.

1:02:46.630 --> 1:02:48.365
What, you just showed up here
like that? No.

1:02:48.365 --> 1:02:50.234
You knew you were coming
at this particular cabin

1:02:50.234 --> 1:02:52.769
where cell reception
wouldn't exist.

1:02:52.769 --> 1:02:54.704
Did you see the banner
at the bottom of the screen?

1:02:54.704 --> 1:02:56.406
It isn't live.
It's preprogramming.

1:02:56.406 --> 1:02:57.774
It's a TV show.

1:02:57.774 --> 1:02:59.376
Leonard, Sabrina,

1:02:59.376 --> 1:03:01.145
all of them knew
this X-Nine show would be on

1:03:01.145 --> 1:03:02.847
- and at what time.
- Andrew, this virus

1:03:02.847 --> 1:03:04.514
- is gonna spread everywhere.
- If you...

1:03:04.514 --> 1:03:06.951
It's a fucking
preprogrammed show!

1:03:07.751 --> 1:03:09.719
They knew this virus show
would be on at this time,

1:03:09.719 --> 1:03:11.355
just like they knew
the Alaskan earthquake

1:03:11.355 --> 1:03:13.290
and the tsunami warning
had already happened

1:03:13.290 --> 1:03:15.525
before they showed up here.

1:03:22.499 --> 1:03:24.902
I'm clearheaded now.

1:03:27.938 --> 1:03:29.974
Always together.

1:03:34.211 --> 1:03:37.014
You don't talk to him
from now on. You talk to me.

1:03:44.554 --> 1:03:46.023
I want to watch
Paddington and Chloe now!

1:03:46.023 --> 1:03:48.025
I want to watch
Paddington and Chloe!

1:03:48.025 --> 1:03:49.826
Wen.

1:03:51.028 --> 1:03:52.562
I want to watch a cartoon now!

1:03:52.562 --> 1:03:54.198
- Wen, okay.

1:03:54.198 --> 1:03:55.866
We're gonna count down from
five together, and we're not

1:03:55.866 --> 1:03:57.401
- gonna yell anymore, okay?
- I want to watch it now!

1:03:57.401 --> 1:03:59.169
Wen. Five...

1:03:59.169 --> 1:04:01.005
I want to watch Paddington
and Chloe now! -...four...

1:04:01.005 --> 1:04:02.439
- Okay, let's try this again.
- I want to watch a cartoon!

1:04:02.439 --> 1:04:04.108
Wen, take a deep breath.

1:04:04.108 --> 1:04:06.310
- And five...

1:04:06.310 --> 1:04:08.212
four... -I want to watch
Paddington and Chloe now!

1:04:08.212 --> 1:04:10.014
- Wen. Three...

1:04:10.014 --> 1:04:13.283
Get away from my family,
you fucking losers! -Eric! Eric!

1:04:13.283 --> 1:04:15.185
Eric! Eric!
Please stop. Please.

1:04:15.185 --> 1:04:17.487
- Stop! That's my dad.
- Everyone needs you.

1:04:17.487 --> 1:04:19.323
No! No, I don't believe you!

1:04:19.323 --> 1:04:21.926
- Eric, please. Please stop...
- No. No, no. Back away from me.

1:04:21.926 --> 1:04:25.029
Don't you look at me.
Don't you look at my daughter!

1:04:25.029 --> 1:04:26.496
Look, you don't
understand what you're doing!

1:04:26.496 --> 1:04:27.965
I don't fucking
believe you! No! -Please!

1:04:27.965 --> 1:04:31.001
No! No, I don't believe
a word you say! Fuck you!

1:04:35.973 --> 1:04:37.407
- Andrew.

1:04:47.651 --> 1:04:49.819
I hit you in the knee
just so you wouldn't run away.

1:04:49.819 --> 1:04:52.722
This is triage,
like in an emergency room.

1:04:52.722 --> 1:04:54.758
We have to make the decision
to save the most lives.

1:04:54.758 --> 1:04:56.193
We have to help each other.

1:04:56.193 --> 1:04:58.929
We have to help each other.

1:05:11.441 --> 1:05:12.977
- Open up!

1:05:12.977 --> 1:05:15.179
Andrew, listen to me!

1:05:15.179 --> 1:05:17.047
Andrew.

1:05:21.986 --> 1:05:23.120
Come on.

1:05:24.521 --> 1:05:26.656
Please! Come out!

1:05:26.656 --> 1:05:28.025
- Come on.

1:05:29.259 --> 1:05:30.961
Stay away from me.

1:05:30.961 --> 1:05:33.097
Stay away from me!
I will kill you!

1:05:33.097 --> 1:05:34.631
Stay away from me!

1:05:40.870 --> 1:05:42.572
Please stop!

1:05:49.579 --> 1:05:50.880
Leave whatever you're going for,

1:05:50.880 --> 1:05:54.151
get out of the car
and come inside!

1:05:54.985 --> 1:05:57.487
I don't want to have
to hurt you!

1:05:58.255 --> 1:06:00.424
- Come back inside!

1:06:00.424 --> 1:06:02.059
Now!

1:06:02.059 --> 1:06:03.960
We don't have time for this!
Please!

1:06:03.960 --> 1:06:05.862
Andrew, listen.

1:06:13.670 --> 1:06:15.972
Now, you listen to me,
you crazy fucking bitch.

1:06:16.806 --> 1:06:18.675
You drop that thing
and back the fuck up.

1:06:18.675 --> 1:06:21.778
Okay. Okay.

1:06:21.778 --> 1:06:23.813
- Back the fuck up!
- Okay, okay!

1:06:25.282 --> 1:06:27.984
- Keep going!
- Okay, okay.

1:06:27.984 --> 1:06:29.153
Move!

1:06:29.153 --> 1:06:30.720
Breathe.

1:06:35.292 --> 1:06:37.694
Stop. Stop!

1:06:47.271 --> 1:06:50.074
Fuck. Fuck.

1:07:05.889 --> 1:07:06.890
Stay back!

1:07:06.890 --> 1:07:08.325
I believe you were chosen because

1:07:08.325 --> 1:07:10.927
your family's love
for each other is so pure.

1:07:10.927 --> 1:07:12.529
I know you've been through
a lot,

1:07:12.529 --> 1:07:13.963
and people haven't been fair
to you.

1:07:18.001 --> 1:07:20.904
Drop the weapon
and move away from Eric,

1:07:20.904 --> 1:07:23.973
or I'll show you I was chosen
to put a bullet in your head.

1:07:23.973 --> 1:07:27.377
Drop it now, Leonard,
or I'll kill you!

1:07:27.377 --> 1:07:29.246
You're dooming us all, Andrew.

1:07:29.246 --> 1:07:31.815
You're dooming your husband,
you're dooming your daughter...

1:07:31.815 --> 1:07:33.350
I'm done with you!

1:07:33.350 --> 1:07:35.652
I'm not listening to another
goddamn word you say!

1:07:38.155 --> 1:07:40.090
It's time
for the next sacrifice.

1:07:41.158 --> 1:07:43.360
Are you willing
to make a choice?

1:07:43.360 --> 1:07:45.162
You're crazy.

1:07:46.096 --> 1:07:49.966
I'm taking my family,
and I'm leaving.

1:07:52.936 --> 1:07:54.604
- Andrew!

1:08:08.418 --> 1:08:10.620
You have a temper.

1:08:10.620 --> 1:08:14.458
Not in a scary way, just...

1:08:14.458 --> 1:08:16.326
It's there.

1:08:16.326 --> 1:08:18.995
You're uptight.

1:08:18.995 --> 1:08:20.964
You can...

1:08:20.964 --> 1:08:23.867
suck the life
out of any situation.

1:08:23.867 --> 1:08:26.503
Hey, we said you have
to qualify things.

1:08:26.503 --> 1:08:27.937
I'm sorry. You...

1:08:27.937 --> 1:08:30.540
You suck the life
out of some situations.

1:08:31.708 --> 1:08:33.777
I'll accept that.

1:08:33.777 --> 1:08:36.346
It's not a bad list.

1:08:36.346 --> 1:08:39.649
I think most parents would have
a worse list than that.

1:08:40.450 --> 1:08:42.786
I can't believe
we're actually gonna do this.

1:08:42.786 --> 1:08:45.789
I have never,

1:08:45.789 --> 1:08:48.692
for one second of my life,

1:08:48.692 --> 1:08:51.027
ever doubted loving you.

1:08:52.028 --> 1:08:55.165
The kid'll be washed in that
every day.

1:08:55.165 --> 1:08:58.668
How is it you can say stuff
like that out of nowhere?

1:08:58.668 --> 1:09:01.205
Can you guys keep it down?

1:09:03.207 --> 1:09:05.108
Were we being loud?

1:09:05.108 --> 1:09:08.645
I'm trying to have a drink
with my friends.

1:09:09.546 --> 1:09:11.815
Oh, we were being too loud?

1:09:12.749 --> 1:09:15.084
Is that what it is?

1:09:16.386 --> 1:09:19.789
Get your drunk ass
back to your seat.

1:09:20.557 --> 1:09:22.892
Fuck you.

1:09:26.463 --> 1:09:28.298
You shouldn't provoke them.

1:09:28.298 --> 1:09:29.533
I wasn't provoking...

1:09:29.533 --> 1:09:31.601
Oh, my God! What the fuck?

1:09:31.601 --> 1:09:33.136
What the fuck?
Andrew, are you okay?

1:09:33.136 --> 1:09:34.538
- Andrew.

1:09:34.538 --> 1:09:36.406
Oh, my God! What the fuck!

1:09:37.607 --> 1:09:39.643
Somebody call an ambulance!

1:09:39.643 --> 1:09:41.645
Andrew! Andrew, look at me.

1:09:41.645 --> 1:09:43.447
Andrew, look at me.
Are you okay?

1:09:43.447 --> 1:09:44.981
Open your eyes. Open your eyes.

1:09:44.981 --> 1:09:47.717
Can you hear me? Andrew!

1:10:09.172 --> 1:10:11.908
All right, so what
you got here is an HK P30.

1:10:11.908 --> 1:10:15.879
German engineered, very light,
very easy to handle.

1:10:16.980 --> 1:10:19.616
Um, pretty much good
for any scenario.

1:10:19.616 --> 1:10:21.184
Carry, home protection.

1:10:21.184 --> 1:10:22.919
Screw 'em, right?

1:10:27.491 --> 1:10:29.359
I'll take it.

1:10:43.640 --> 1:10:45.809
No, Leonard.

1:10:49.245 --> 1:10:51.981
Are you willing
to make a sacrifice?

1:10:53.049 --> 1:10:54.784
No more, you bastard.

1:10:58.221 --> 1:11:01.190
A part of humanity
has been judged.

1:11:16.172 --> 1:11:19.042
The four of us
can't make this decision.

1:11:19.042 --> 1:11:20.944
It's got to be your choice.

1:11:20.944 --> 1:11:23.112
Shut your mouth.

1:11:25.815 --> 1:11:27.351
Keep an eye on Leonard.

1:11:28.885 --> 1:11:30.987
Yell if he does anything.

1:12:05.589 --> 1:12:07.857
It's O'Bannon.

1:12:17.801 --> 1:12:19.168
They were here to torture us.

1:12:19.168 --> 1:12:20.970
We don't know why
we were chosen.

1:12:20.970 --> 1:12:23.106
Don't say another word
of your horseshit!

1:12:23.106 --> 1:12:27.143
None of this is real,
and you were targeting us!

1:12:27.143 --> 1:12:29.145
I always look for motive, Leonard.

1:12:29.145 --> 1:12:30.847
How about a crazy bigot

1:12:30.847 --> 1:12:32.882
meets a bartender
from a bar somewhere,

1:12:32.882 --> 1:12:35.184
and they find a woman
from a small town

1:12:35.184 --> 1:12:37.454
who has extreme
religious beliefs.

1:12:37.454 --> 1:12:38.555
That's not true.

1:12:38.555 --> 1:12:39.989
Then they come across
a young woman

1:12:39.989 --> 1:12:41.658
who can be persuaded
of anything.

1:12:41.658 --> 1:12:44.260
I didn't believe for a second
that Adriane had a kid, Leonard!

1:12:45.562 --> 1:12:48.932
Now, I'm not a murderer
like you guys,

1:12:48.932 --> 1:12:51.034
so I'm gonna lock you
in that bathroom.

1:12:53.269 --> 1:12:55.171
They slashed our tires,

1:12:55.171 --> 1:12:59.409
but they must've come
in a... a truck or a vehicle.

1:13:00.944 --> 1:13:03.379
We have to get to that vehicle.

1:13:03.379 --> 1:13:06.115
You're wrong about all of us.

1:13:06.115 --> 1:13:07.917
Now get in that bathroom, Leonard.

1:13:07.917 --> 1:13:09.252
And make no mistake,

1:13:09.252 --> 1:13:12.288
I will fucking kill you
if I have to.

1:13:20.329 --> 1:13:22.165
We need something
to tie the doorknob to.

1:13:22.165 --> 1:13:23.967
The lamp.

1:13:23.967 --> 1:13:25.669
Here.

1:13:30.507 --> 1:13:32.776
Okay. Come on. Come on.

1:13:36.780 --> 1:13:38.281
He broke the window.

1:13:38.281 --> 1:13:40.149
He got out.

1:13:42.218 --> 1:13:43.853
He's gonna come get us!

1:13:48.592 --> 1:13:51.194
He's gonna get to the car
before us.

1:13:51.194 --> 1:13:52.696
He could be outside and hurt us.

1:13:52.696 --> 1:13:55.231
We have to make sure
he's in the bathroom.

1:13:56.533 --> 1:13:58.201
Leonard?

1:14:00.837 --> 1:14:04.373
If I open this door and
I see you, I will shoot you.

1:14:07.410 --> 1:14:09.245
Leonard!

1:15:05.802 --> 1:15:06.903
Get off him!

1:15:19.448 --> 1:15:22.986
Fuck. Fuck.

1:15:29.959 --> 1:15:31.427
I thought you wouldn't kill us.

1:15:31.427 --> 1:15:33.262
I won't.

1:15:33.262 --> 1:15:34.964
But I will shoot you in the leg

1:15:34.964 --> 1:15:36.766
to keep you from leaving
this cabin.

1:15:36.766 --> 1:15:38.768
Turn on the TV
if you want to be convinced.

1:15:39.969 --> 1:15:41.304
You'll see that everything

1:15:41.304 --> 1:15:42.972
I said was gonna happen
has happened.

1:15:42.972 --> 1:15:45.074
No one's gonna do what you
say... -More terrifying images

1:15:45.074 --> 1:15:47.076
as we see yet another
passenger aircraft

1:15:47.076 --> 1:15:49.278
- plummet to the ground.

1:15:49.278 --> 1:15:51.781
- Eric, what are you doing?

1:15:54.017 --> 1:15:55.451
Why did you turn it on?

1:15:55.451 --> 1:15:57.186
Local and
international governments

1:15:57.186 --> 1:15:59.255
are investigating whether
there's any correlation

1:15:59.255 --> 1:16:01.224
between the crashes.

1:16:01.224 --> 1:16:03.492
We have yet to receive
death tolls

1:16:03.492 --> 1:16:06.630
or receive any statements
from the airlines.

1:16:21.210 --> 1:16:23.212
You said it wasn't real.

1:16:49.438 --> 1:16:51.307
The skies will fall
and crash to the earth

1:16:51.307 --> 1:16:53.342
like pieces of glass.

1:16:53.342 --> 1:16:56.713
And God's fingers
will scorch the earth...

1:16:56.713 --> 1:17:00.349
and an everlasting darkness
will descend over humanity.

1:17:01.584 --> 1:17:03.486
We now have confirmation

1:17:03.486 --> 1:17:07.556
of as many as 700 airplanes
having crashed without warning,

1:17:07.556 --> 1:17:09.625
without issuing distress calls,

1:17:09.625 --> 1:17:11.895
amid fears
and increasing speculation

1:17:11.895 --> 1:17:14.764
there may have been
a coordinated cyberattack...

1:17:14.764 --> 1:17:17.033
That terrorist stuff
has nothing to do with this.

1:17:17.033 --> 1:17:18.434
I've heard this before.

1:17:18.434 --> 1:17:20.503
TSA has yet
to issue a statement.

1:17:20.503 --> 1:17:23.807
Airports around the globe
are canceling flights.

1:17:25.074 --> 1:17:27.410
- It is hard...
- It is hard...

1:17:27.410 --> 1:17:29.145
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

1:17:29.145 --> 1:17:32.281
It is hard to describe
the images that we are seeing.

1:17:32.281 --> 1:17:36.385
They fill us with disquietude
and horror.

1:17:36.385 --> 1:17:38.688
We are witnessing
a collective tragedy

1:17:38.688 --> 1:17:41.891
unfathomable
only moments before.

1:17:44.160 --> 1:17:46.562
We are getting word
of more airline...

1:17:47.330 --> 1:17:49.699
How the fuck did you know
what she was gonna say?

1:17:49.699 --> 1:17:53.369
Is this some closed-circuit TV?
Did you guys pump this in?

1:17:53.369 --> 1:17:56.105
Maybe the truth is...

1:17:56.105 --> 1:17:57.540
is that the end was happening

1:17:57.540 --> 1:18:00.744
long before
we got to this cabin.

1:18:00.744 --> 1:18:04.180
And what we're seeing now
isn't the fireworks.

1:18:04.180 --> 1:18:07.050
It's just the final
flickering sparks.

1:18:07.817 --> 1:18:10.119
I don't know
what's going on here,

1:18:10.119 --> 1:18:12.789
but where are the keys
to the truck you guys came in?

1:18:12.789 --> 1:18:13.990
Andrew.

1:18:13.990 --> 1:18:18.161
I'm taking my family...
and we're leaving.

1:18:19.462 --> 1:18:24.300
Do you really think that
everything that happened today,

1:18:24.300 --> 1:18:26.903
everything we've seen...

1:18:28.437 --> 1:18:31.574
Do you really think
it's all just a coincidence?

1:18:32.575 --> 1:18:33.977
Yes.

1:18:33.977 --> 1:18:35.912
I think it's all a coincidence.

1:18:36.746 --> 1:18:39.515
Some horrible,
unexplainable coincidence.

1:18:39.515 --> 1:18:41.184
Or it has to be a trick.

1:18:41.184 --> 1:18:43.186
I have to believe that!

1:18:44.020 --> 1:18:46.455
You already don't believe that.

1:18:48.424 --> 1:18:50.760
I know when someone's lying.

1:18:51.895 --> 1:18:53.562
Eric...

1:18:53.562 --> 1:18:55.865
let's go.

1:18:57.566 --> 1:19:01.537
Let's get out of here
and never come back.

1:19:03.072 --> 1:19:04.974
Don't listen to Leonard anymore.

1:19:20.423 --> 1:19:23.626
Can everyone come out
onto the back deck now?

1:19:25.528 --> 1:19:28.564
I'd like to do
this last part outside.

1:19:34.370 --> 1:19:36.739
What are you doing
with that, Leonard?

1:19:39.242 --> 1:19:42.611
When I'm gone, you'll only have
minutes to stop everything.

1:19:42.611 --> 1:19:44.948
After that, it'll be too late.

1:19:46.582 --> 1:19:48.151
Will all the children die?

1:19:48.151 --> 1:19:50.753
Wen, I want you to take
your music and your headphones

1:19:50.753 --> 1:19:52.956
and go to that tree house
that we climbed in.

1:19:52.956 --> 1:19:56.092
Put your music on until
one of us comes to get you.

1:19:56.092 --> 1:19:58.394
Do what Daddy says, okay?

1:20:01.564 --> 1:20:02.932
I love you, chicken.

1:20:02.932 --> 1:20:04.600
I love you, too.

1:20:05.935 --> 1:20:07.871
Go. Go.

1:20:09.072 --> 1:20:11.774
Nothing can happen
to the three of us.

1:20:11.774 --> 1:20:13.442
You'll be okay.

1:20:16.312 --> 1:20:19.715
The worst thing about
the visions was the screaming.

1:20:21.084 --> 1:20:23.452
I could hear everyone screaming.

1:20:24.653 --> 1:20:26.089
And I knew
when the visions ended,

1:20:26.089 --> 1:20:30.793
the screaming was just
gonna go on and on.

1:20:36.065 --> 1:20:39.035
You know what I loved most
about teaching kids?

1:20:40.336 --> 1:20:42.671
They believe everything you say.

1:20:43.606 --> 1:20:45.708
So you have to be careful.

1:20:46.475 --> 1:20:50.746
Say only what you know,
what you know to be true.

1:20:51.614 --> 1:20:54.017
It's a big responsibility.

1:20:56.685 --> 1:20:59.088
Maybe one of the kids I taught

1:20:59.088 --> 1:21:01.925
will do something great
for the world.

1:21:01.925 --> 1:21:04.027
What do you think?

1:21:08.097 --> 1:21:10.533
Please...

1:21:10.533 --> 1:21:16.572
my new friends, Eric, Andrew...

1:21:19.808 --> 1:21:24.213
...will you make a choice
and save the world?

1:21:35.691 --> 1:21:37.961
All of humanity has been judged.

1:22:42.625 --> 1:22:45.094
We still have a few minutes,
he said.

1:22:47.463 --> 1:22:48.697
Eric.

1:22:48.697 --> 1:22:51.434
There was something
in the light.

1:22:51.434 --> 1:22:53.169
A figure.

1:22:59.042 --> 1:23:01.510
And I feel it now.

1:23:08.417 --> 1:23:10.486
I believe you.

1:23:12.255 --> 1:23:14.890
Let's the three of us leave.

1:23:19.795 --> 1:23:22.665
Maybe this is the way
it's always been.

1:23:24.267 --> 1:23:27.803
Maybe families have been
deciding this all through time.

1:23:29.572 --> 1:23:32.041
Let's just walk the earth, then.

1:23:33.242 --> 1:23:35.044
The three of us.

1:23:35.044 --> 1:23:37.913
What kind of life is that
for Wen?

1:23:40.483 --> 1:23:42.585
Andrew, this wasn't
a home invasion.

1:23:44.320 --> 1:23:45.821
They didn't target us.

1:23:45.821 --> 1:23:48.724
They came here
to spend time with us...

1:23:50.493 --> 1:23:53.229
...for us to get to know them.

1:23:53.229 --> 1:23:56.099
They remind us of all aspects
of humanity.

1:23:57.100 --> 1:23:59.802
Redmond, malice.

1:23:59.802 --> 1:24:02.571
Adriane, nurturing.

1:24:02.571 --> 1:24:05.341
Sabrina, healing.

1:24:05.341 --> 1:24:07.410
Leonard, guidance.

1:24:08.177 --> 1:24:10.779
They're the Four Horsemen
of the Apocalypse.

1:24:10.779 --> 1:24:12.481
I believe we had
to see them die.

1:24:12.481 --> 1:24:14.617
We had to feel their loss.

1:24:15.384 --> 1:24:17.520
Why us?

1:24:18.521 --> 1:24:20.556
We're nothing special.

1:24:20.556 --> 1:24:23.192
Because I know what I felt when
we saw Wen in that orphanage

1:24:23.192 --> 1:24:25.628
and we were together
for the first time.

1:24:26.429 --> 1:24:27.963
It's our decision.

1:24:30.799 --> 1:24:33.068
It's our fucking decision?

1:24:35.104 --> 1:24:38.341
We're supposed to give up
our love for them?

1:24:38.341 --> 1:24:40.075
It's a sacrifice, Andrew.

1:24:40.075 --> 1:24:41.877
That we would be willing
to give up

1:24:41.877 --> 1:24:43.879
something so beautiful to us
for everyone else.

1:24:43.879 --> 1:24:46.182
- They're not worth it!

1:24:46.182 --> 1:24:47.450
They hate us, Eric.

1:24:47.450 --> 1:24:49.051
They hate that we exist.

1:24:49.051 --> 1:24:50.753
- They're just scared.

1:24:50.753 --> 1:24:52.054
Like all of us.

1:24:52.054 --> 1:24:53.489
They're monsters.

1:24:53.489 --> 1:24:55.291
They destroy everything.

1:24:55.291 --> 1:24:56.659
They hurt each other.

1:24:56.659 --> 1:24:57.960
You're not just a prosecutor.

1:24:57.960 --> 1:24:59.395
You know there's something
to defend.

1:24:59.395 --> 1:25:00.963
That's where your anger
comes from, Andrew.

1:25:01.997 --> 1:25:02.798
Kill me.

1:25:02.798 --> 1:25:04.633
No, sweetheart.

1:25:05.968 --> 1:25:07.870
We're running out of time.

1:25:07.870 --> 1:25:09.838
Maybe I saw a figure,
maybe I just made it up,

1:25:09.838 --> 1:25:11.274
but it's giving me peace.

1:25:11.274 --> 1:25:13.209
My mind is set in its truth.

1:25:14.477 --> 1:25:16.445
I won't be scared.

1:25:16.445 --> 1:25:17.580
You gotta do it now.

1:25:17.580 --> 1:25:19.047
We're out of time. All of us.

1:25:19.047 --> 1:25:20.949
I don't believe in them, Eric.

1:25:20.949 --> 1:25:22.451
I do.

1:25:23.486 --> 1:25:25.454
Do it while I'm thinking
the most beautiful thought

1:25:25.454 --> 1:25:28.524
so that I can have that feeling
in my heart to take me

1:25:28.524 --> 1:25:30.426
right to wherever it is
I'm going.

1:25:31.660 --> 1:25:33.962
It's almost time.
I can feel it.

1:25:33.962 --> 1:25:36.232
Kill me, Eric, please.

1:25:36.232 --> 1:25:39.168
Please. Please.

1:25:39.168 --> 1:25:42.638
I'm thinking about our daughter
in the future.

1:25:46.209 --> 1:25:49.678
And she's living her life
exactly as she wanted to.

1:25:51.580 --> 1:25:53.882
She's got her own practice.

1:25:54.783 --> 1:25:56.219
You're there with her.

1:25:56.219 --> 1:25:57.986
You guys are locking up
her office,

1:25:57.986 --> 1:26:00.289
because you guys
are going to dinner.

1:26:01.957 --> 1:26:05.494
She is everything
we always hoped for.

1:26:09.131 --> 1:26:11.967
She's still got her crazy laugh

1:26:11.967 --> 1:26:15.304
She still asks everybody
questions about everything.

1:26:17.506 --> 1:26:20.509
She found someone who loves her

1:26:20.509 --> 1:26:23.178
and who she loves just as much.

1:26:24.947 --> 1:26:27.115
Just like her dads.

1:26:39.027 --> 1:26:41.297
Eric.

1:26:44.700 --> 1:26:46.835
Eric.

1:27:10.626 --> 1:27:13.161
Did Daddy Eric save everyone?

1:28:56.298 --> 1:28:58.534
Did we stop it in time?

1:29:01.437 --> 1:29:03.506
There's a diner over there.

1:29:18.153 --> 1:29:20.188
The only thing
we could do was climb out

1:29:20.188 --> 1:29:22.257
of the u-upstairs window
onto the roof, but...

1:29:22.257 --> 1:29:24.693
- ...water kept climbing

1:29:24.693 --> 1:29:26.762
higher and higher.

1:29:26.762 --> 1:29:29.064
I mean, no one could hear us.

1:29:29.064 --> 1:29:32.067
Standing on the roof
with my daughters, my girls...

1:29:32.067 --> 1:29:33.636
I thought it was the end.

1:29:33.636 --> 1:29:37.506
And two of my girls, uh,
they can't, they can't swim.

1:29:37.506 --> 1:29:40.375
And the water just...
stopped rising.

1:29:40.375 --> 1:29:42.210
Switch to the other one.

1:29:42.210 --> 1:29:43.746
The last of the planes
in Australia and Russia

1:29:43.746 --> 1:29:45.280
have landed safely.

1:29:45.280 --> 1:29:46.882
Families are rushing
to airports,

1:29:46.882 --> 1:29:48.316
searching for their loved ones.

1:29:48.316 --> 1:29:50.453
Amidst this chaos
are emotional scenes...

1:29:50.453 --> 1:29:52.655
We were rolling the bodies
out into the parking lot

1:29:52.655 --> 1:29:54.156
because there wasn't room.

1:29:54.156 --> 1:29:56.459
This past hour is the first time
in many, many hours

1:29:56.459 --> 1:29:58.994
that we haven't had a death
in the ICU.

1:29:58.994 --> 1:30:00.729
Actually, we're coming up
on our second hour here

1:30:00.729 --> 1:30:01.830
of no deaths.

1:30:01.830 --> 1:30:04.066
I know.

1:30:04.066 --> 1:30:06.368
I love you so much.

1:30:07.803 --> 1:30:10.305
Everything's gonna be okay.

1:30:12.841 --> 1:30:14.443
Hmm.

1:30:14.443 --> 1:30:16.111
The sudden lightning strikes

1:30:16.111 --> 1:30:19.381
that set fire to many areas
have not returned.

1:30:19.381 --> 1:30:21.517
Though several fires have yet
to be extinguished

1:30:21.517 --> 1:30:24.019
and the damage to regions
both rural and urban

1:30:24.019 --> 1:30:25.988
across Great Britain
is extensive

1:30:25.988 --> 1:30:27.523
and remains to be determined,

1:30:27.523 --> 1:30:30.726
the worst conflagrations have,
as of this moment...

1:31:38.493 --> 1:31:40.563
