WEBVTT

00:19.729 --> 00:22.356
(indistinct chatter)

00:26.277 --> 00:28.738
My name is Gene Hasenfus.

00:28.821 --> 00:31.323
Where are you from?

00:31.407 --> 00:33.826
Marinette, Wisconsin.

00:33.909 --> 00:36.620
Can you tell us
how you came to be here?

00:37.955 --> 00:40.583
I was shot out of the sky.

00:40.666 --> 00:42.835
REPORTER: A Wisconsin man
has been the focus

00:42.918 --> 00:44.462
of international news
this week.

00:44.545 --> 00:47.465
45-year-old Eugene Hasenfus
of Marinette

00:47.548 --> 00:52.261
was captured in Nicaragua after
his cargo plane was shot down.

00:52.344 --> 00:55.639
Hasenfus said his mission
was directed by the CIA,

00:55.723 --> 00:59.059
but US officials say
the flights were
privately directed.

01:01.103 --> 01:05.191
There must be no Soviet
beachhead in Central America.

01:07.151 --> 01:09.695
There is no doubt that
the President wanted the policy

01:09.779 --> 01:12.364
of support for the Nicaraguan
resistance pursued,

01:12.448 --> 01:15.493
and I did so to the very
best of my abilities.

01:15.618 --> 01:17.703
Because there's
kind of nagging away

01:17.787 --> 01:19.497
that I knew something
about an operation

01:19.622 --> 01:21.123
with these Contras and all,
which isn't true.

01:21.207 --> 01:23.250
Now, do I support
the Contras? You bet.

01:23.292 --> 01:24.710
There are notations to

01:24.794 --> 01:27.421
"conversations with VP,"
"met with VP."

01:27.505 --> 01:30.800
MAN: "Calls from VP,"
"Felix talking about VP."

01:30.883 --> 01:33.219
Things like that.
There's lots of
other references.

01:33.302 --> 01:36.472
Good afternoon,
Mr. Rodriguez.

01:36.555 --> 01:39.642
Your true name is
Felix Rodriguez, correct?

01:39.725 --> 01:40.976
That is correct, sir.

01:41.060 --> 01:42.436
And you have also
been known

01:42.520 --> 01:44.063
by the name
of Max Gomez, correct?

01:44.146 --> 01:47.191
Yes, sir.

01:47.274 --> 01:50.611
BERRELLEZ: Felix Rodriguez
was a CIA operative.

01:50.694 --> 01:52.947
He interrogated Kiki Camarena

01:53.030 --> 01:57.076
and was there at the scene
where Kiki was killed.

02:15.094 --> 02:17.596
NARRATOR: While
Kiki Camarena investigated

02:17.680 --> 02:21.600
the Guadalajara Cartel
in the early 1980s,

02:21.684 --> 02:24.186
the CIA waged a secret war

02:24.270 --> 02:27.565
that led to the scandal
called Iran-Contra.

02:27.648 --> 02:29.942
It was in Nicaragua,

02:30.025 --> 02:33.696
where a Communist regime was
under siege by the Contras.

02:33.737 --> 02:38.325
A guerrilla army, funded,
armed, and trained by the CIA.

02:38.409 --> 02:40.703
REAGAN: Until these men
are successful

02:40.786 --> 02:42.329
in their freedom struggle,

02:42.413 --> 02:45.124
there will be no peace
in Central America.

02:46.959 --> 02:50.713
NARRATOR:
In 1984, one year before
Camarena was murdered,

02:50.796 --> 02:53.382
the US Congress cut off
funding to the Contras,

02:53.465 --> 02:56.176
and passed a law
banning the CIA

02:56.260 --> 02:58.762
from backing
the anti-communist rebels.

02:58.846 --> 03:04.393
In response, CIA and National
Security Council officials

03:04.476 --> 03:08.689
cooked up new,
covert ways to get money
and guns to the Contras.

03:08.772 --> 03:11.775
Senate hearings
and media investigations

03:11.859 --> 03:14.028
later alleged
that CIA operatives

03:14.111 --> 03:16.572
smuggled tons of cocaine
into the US

03:16.655 --> 03:19.491
to fund the illegal war
in Nicaragua.

03:19.575 --> 03:22.286
But until now,
it's remained a mystery

03:22.369 --> 03:25.372
how the war on communism
and the war on drugs

03:25.456 --> 03:28.918
collided to make a martyr
of Kiki Camarena.

03:53.108 --> 03:54.902
BERRELLEZ:
During the investigation,

03:54.985 --> 03:59.490
the name of Max Gomez,
a Cuban, kept coming up.

03:59.573 --> 04:02.076
So, I do photo lineups,

04:02.159 --> 04:04.203
10 pictures of Hispanic males,

04:04.286 --> 04:08.916
and included
Ismael Felix Rodriguez.

04:08.999 --> 04:11.168
And I asked René,
"Do you see anybody here

04:11.251 --> 04:13.379
that interrogated
Kiki Camarena?"

04:13.462 --> 04:14.838
And he goes,
"Yeah, this guy right here,

04:14.922 --> 04:16.423
I told you about him,
Max Gomez."

04:16.507 --> 04:19.510
I go to Godoy with
the same photo lineup.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.178
I says, "Who do you see here

04:21.261 --> 04:23.013
that was involved in
pre-abduction meetings,

04:23.097 --> 04:24.974
and might've been involved
in picking up Kiki?"

04:25.057 --> 04:26.934
"Max Gomez,
this guy right here,

04:27.017 --> 04:29.228
the guy that
I've heard on the tapes

04:29.311 --> 04:31.480
interrogating Kiki Camarena."
Boom.

04:31.563 --> 04:34.233
I go to Ramon Lira.
"Who do you see

04:34.316 --> 04:36.068
that you recognize here
was at Lope de Vega?"

04:36.151 --> 04:37.695
He says, "Ismael Felix
Rodriguez right there,

04:37.778 --> 04:39.154
I told you about him,
that's him."

04:40.614 --> 04:42.700
I identified him.

04:45.327 --> 04:47.955
I go to my people and I says,
"Run this guy all over!"

04:53.794 --> 04:55.629
And he lit up
like a Christmas tree.

04:55.713 --> 04:57.506
I mean, this guy
is all over the place.

05:04.013 --> 05:07.057
HOLM: Felix Rodriguez
worked for the CIA.

05:07.141 --> 05:11.270
He was on the hunt
for Che Guevara in Bolivia

05:11.353 --> 05:12.938
when they tracked him down

05:13.022 --> 05:14.481
and the Bolivian army
killed him.

05:17.735 --> 05:22.948
Then, he was assigned
to Operation Phoenix in Vietnam

05:23.032 --> 05:27.786
where they identified
and assassinated
Vietcong commanders.

05:27.870 --> 05:29.913
The guy's a legend.

05:36.587 --> 05:39.882
REPORTER:
Felix Rodriguez was
born in Cuba in 1941

05:39.965 --> 05:42.217
into a life of
comfort and privilege.

05:42.301 --> 05:45.846
Early on he was fascinated
by guns and the military.

05:45.929 --> 05:48.015
But when
Fidel Castro overthrew

05:48.098 --> 05:51.268
the US-backed Bautista
regime in 1959,

05:51.351 --> 05:53.771
Rodriguez became obsessed
with just one goal,

05:53.854 --> 05:56.023
to liberate Cuba
from communism.

05:56.106 --> 05:57.816
How did the CIA get to you?

05:57.900 --> 06:00.027
Well, I got to them.

06:05.324 --> 06:09.536
BERRELLEZ:
Felix Rodriguez participated
in the Bay of Pigs.

06:09.620 --> 06:13.791
And by the way, he's very
close to old man Bush.

06:18.045 --> 06:21.340
MIKE WALLACE:
Rodriguez says he first
went to Salvador in 1985

06:21.423 --> 06:23.717
on his own initiative
as a private citizen

06:23.801 --> 06:27.096
to help the Salvadorians
in their fight against
the Communists.

06:27.179 --> 06:29.348
Just months after
arriving in Salvador,

06:29.431 --> 06:32.184
Rodriguez says he received
a letter from Oliver North,

06:32.267 --> 06:34.937
whom he had met in Washington,
a letter that began,

06:35.020 --> 06:38.315
"Dear Felix, after reading
this letter, please destroy it."

06:38.398 --> 06:41.026
North went on
to recruit Rodriguez

06:41.110 --> 06:44.154
into managing the illegal
Contra resupply operation

06:44.238 --> 06:48.033
headquartered at
the Ilopango Airbase
outside San Salvador.

06:48.117 --> 06:53.831
Felix Rodriguez was an
experienced interrogator.

06:53.914 --> 06:56.667
What business did he have

06:56.750 --> 07:00.963
interrogating DEA Agent
Enrique Camarena?

07:08.637 --> 07:12.724
I have another
question, sir.

07:12.808 --> 07:16.270
You've been in that part
of the world for a long time.

07:16.353 --> 07:20.274
Were you aware of any
drugs being transported

07:20.357 --> 07:23.360
out of Central America
into the United States?

07:23.443 --> 07:24.820
No, sir.

07:24.903 --> 07:26.363
Never heard of that?

07:26.446 --> 07:27.906
Well, I have heard of that,

07:27.990 --> 07:29.575
but direct knowledge of it,
I haven't,

07:29.658 --> 07:31.743
or participation
or any type of that thing.

07:31.827 --> 07:37.291
Did you hear of
any activity by those
contracted by Americans?

07:37.374 --> 07:39.084
What I have seen
in the papers, sir.

07:40.711 --> 07:42.462
Other than that,
you're not aware of it.

07:42.546 --> 07:43.797
No, sir.

07:43.881 --> 07:45.174
BERRELLEZ:
I went to Godoy and said,

07:45.257 --> 07:46.842
"Where have you seen this guy

07:46.925 --> 07:49.178
Max Gomez/Felix Rodriguez?"

07:49.261 --> 07:51.680
And he said,
"Well, one time,

07:51.763 --> 07:53.932
"we were sent by Fonseca
to the airport,

07:54.016 --> 07:57.895
"and we met with this guy
Max Gomez/Felix Rodriguez.

07:57.978 --> 08:00.689
And he delivered a whole
bunch of weapons to us."

08:00.772 --> 08:02.482
Not only did I see Max Gomez
at the airport,

08:02.566 --> 08:04.401
I also saw him in safe houses

08:04.484 --> 08:08.280
taking money in bags,

08:08.363 --> 08:09.823
narco-dollars,

08:09.907 --> 08:11.992
blood money,

08:12.075 --> 08:14.161
death money...

08:14.244 --> 08:17.289
Blood money.

08:18.248 --> 08:22.461
BERRELLEZ:
He was delivering weapons
to Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo?

08:22.544 --> 08:25.464
"Definitely, yes he was."

08:27.132 --> 08:29.176
And I went to Ramon Lira.

08:29.259 --> 08:32.012
"Ramon, tell me about this guy
Felix Rodriguez, who is he?"

08:32.095 --> 08:34.973
"He's a CIA guy,
I told you already.

08:35.057 --> 08:37.851
He would bring weapons
to Fonseca."

08:37.935 --> 08:41.563
This was in mid-1984,
when he delivered a shipment

08:41.647 --> 08:45.275
of AK-47s and hand grenades

08:45.359 --> 08:46.944
to a house owned by
Ernesto Fonseca,

08:47.027 --> 08:50.530
located down
Mar Marmara Street.

08:51.198 --> 08:56.036
At one point, Fonseca and
Felix Rodriguez disappeared.

08:56.119 --> 08:58.372
They went to talk
inside a room.

08:58.455 --> 09:00.249
After a while,

09:00.332 --> 09:04.044
Felix Rodriguez came out of
the room with a suitcase.

09:04.127 --> 09:05.629
The suitcase
wasn't full of clothes.

09:05.712 --> 09:07.965
It was packed with money.

09:11.510 --> 09:12.970
BERRELLEZ:
Blew my mind.

09:13.053 --> 09:15.389
I said, what am I
dealing with here?

09:15.472 --> 09:17.599
This is not
the Camarena case

09:17.683 --> 09:20.310
that I thought I was
supposed to be investigating.

09:20.394 --> 09:22.354
It seems like our own
government's involved,

09:22.437 --> 09:26.608
the CIA's involved,
the DFS is involved.

09:26.692 --> 09:29.569
Then, I'm really now
getting like worried

09:29.653 --> 09:31.947
about this investigation,
where am I going
with this stuff?

09:35.492 --> 09:37.661
I kept focusing in
on Max Gomez.

09:37.744 --> 09:41.039
And I asked, "Rene,
where did you see this guy?"

09:41.415 --> 09:44.543
LOPEZ:
I saw him on three occasions.

09:44.626 --> 09:47.629
When the kidnapping
of Kiki was planned.

09:47.713 --> 09:49.631
He was at
the Hotel Fiesta Americana

09:49.715 --> 09:51.550
and at the Hyatt Hotel.

09:53.176 --> 09:57.264
GODOY:
At the Hyatt Hotel,
in another meeting,

09:57.347 --> 10:00.851
I also heard
the plans being made.

10:00.934 --> 10:05.856
They wanted to kidnap
a DEA agent.

10:07.816 --> 10:14.323
I saw Felix Rodriguez again
on February 6th, 1985,

10:14.406 --> 10:19.119
in a house owned by
Rafael Caro Quintero,

10:19.202 --> 10:21.872
located on Hidalgo Avenue.

10:21.955 --> 10:24.624
Felix Rodriguez was there,

10:24.708 --> 10:27.836
Felix Gallardo was there.

10:27.919 --> 10:30.047
Caro Quintero was there.

10:30.130 --> 10:33.175
Manuel Bartlett Diaz
was there.

10:33.258 --> 10:36.595
General Arevalo Gardoqui
was there.

10:36.678 --> 10:39.639
General Vinicio
Santoyo Feria was there.

10:39.723 --> 10:41.391
It was a meeting of
the cartel leaders.

10:43.352 --> 10:45.520
What a coincidence

10:45.604 --> 10:47.939
this meeting happened
the night before

10:48.023 --> 10:51.068
the kidnapping, torture
and murder of Camarena.

10:51.151 --> 10:54.237
The top Narco leaders
held a meeting,

10:54.321 --> 10:58.700
along with politicians,
CIA, Mexican Army.

10:58.784 --> 11:00.494
Call it whatever you want.

11:00.577 --> 11:03.080
What a coincidence this
took place one day before

11:03.163 --> 11:06.583
the capture, torture,
and death of Camarena.

11:09.920 --> 11:11.838
I then went back
to Rene and I said,

11:11.922 --> 11:15.300
"Where else did you see this
guy, Rodriguez, the CIA guy?"

11:15.384 --> 11:19.554
"I also saw him
at Rancho Veracruz."

11:49.543 --> 11:52.838
LOPEZ:
We went to the ranch
in Veracruz,

11:52.921 --> 11:57.801
we flew with Ernesto Fonseca
on his jet.

12:00.595 --> 12:02.764
When we landed at the ranch,

12:02.848 --> 12:05.976
I saw a lot of people there.

12:06.059 --> 12:08.186
I was really impressed.

12:08.270 --> 12:11.648
I'd never seen anything
like it before.

12:11.731 --> 12:14.901
So many weapons,
so many drugs.

12:14.985 --> 12:17.612
Especially cocaine.

12:17.696 --> 12:20.532
Some 10, 15 tons.

12:20.615 --> 12:22.242
They were in big packages.

12:22.325 --> 12:25.245
I'd seen a lot of
marijuana before.

12:25.328 --> 12:28.373
But this was cocaine,
weapons, money.

12:29.124 --> 12:30.250
And a lot of important people,

12:30.333 --> 12:33.211
a lot of the big shots.

12:35.005 --> 12:38.508
It was a very big ranch.

12:39.593 --> 12:41.887
And the air strip, well,

12:41.970 --> 12:44.306
it was very professional.

12:44.389 --> 12:46.516
Even with workers
who directed planes

12:46.600 --> 12:47.809
like at the airport.

12:51.188 --> 12:54.566
INTERVIEWER: And what did they
explain to you about the ranch?

12:54.649 --> 12:56.610
No, no, they didn't
give you any explanation.

12:56.693 --> 12:58.987
You were never
given an explanation.

12:59.070 --> 13:02.532
I was just a bodyguard.

13:02.616 --> 13:04.367
Of course, you could
see everything there.

13:04.451 --> 13:06.036
INTERVIEWER:
And who owned the ranch?

13:06.119 --> 13:08.955
That was
Caro Quintero's ranch.

13:10.040 --> 13:11.458
INTERVIEWER: And what were they

13:11.541 --> 13:13.418
loading or unloading
from the planes?

13:13.502 --> 13:15.378
Well, when we arrived
at the ranch,

13:15.462 --> 13:17.255
the cocaine
was already there.

13:17.339 --> 13:20.592
They were unloading
weapons from a plane.

13:22.135 --> 13:23.595
They finished
unloading the weapons

13:23.678 --> 13:25.388
and started to
load the drugs.

13:26.932 --> 13:29.392
BERRELLEZ:
"What else did you see there?"

13:29.476 --> 13:31.770
"Well, we saw
military operations,
people training there,

13:31.853 --> 13:35.148
"shooting fields
and stuff like that.

13:35.232 --> 13:37.734
"And there was a big airstrip

13:37.817 --> 13:40.195
with American
government planes."

14:58.607 --> 15:01.234
LIRA:
They would not stop asking
him the same questions.

15:01.318 --> 15:04.487
What had he found out
about the CIA,

15:04.571 --> 15:07.365
what investigations
he had into the CIA,

15:07.449 --> 15:11.202
the nexus of the CIA
with drug trafficking,

15:11.286 --> 15:13.830
and what he knew about
the relationship

15:13.913 --> 15:17.834
between the Mexican government,
the CIA, and the Narcos.

15:21.046 --> 15:25.508
MAN:
I've been spending some time
looking at the numbers here

15:25.592 --> 15:28.011
of the amount of aid

15:28.094 --> 15:31.181
that the Contras were getting
at various times...

15:31.264 --> 15:34.851
...and I come to the conclusion
that we're missing something.

15:34.934 --> 15:37.187
That there's got to be

15:37.270 --> 15:40.357
another source of funding
for the Contras...

15:40.440 --> 15:43.943
Well, I don't think
I can help you there.

15:44.027 --> 15:46.237
I don't know of anything else.

15:46.321 --> 15:48.615
I think there's gotta be
some other source of funds

15:48.698 --> 15:52.619
that we -
we meaning this committee -
has not yet uncovered.

16:14.557 --> 16:19.312
BERRELLEZ:
Guillermo González Calderoni,
he worked well with DEA

16:19.396 --> 16:23.066
even though he also received
money from the cartels.

16:25.402 --> 16:29.656
When the president of Mexico
asked for his arrest,

16:29.739 --> 16:33.451
he knew that
he was going to be killed,

16:33.535 --> 16:34.619
so he calls me
and he says, "Hector,"

16:34.703 --> 16:36.329
he says, "You gotta help me.

16:36.413 --> 16:37.664
"They're gonna kill me
in my own country here.

16:37.747 --> 16:39.874
"The president Carlos Salinas

16:39.958 --> 16:42.544
and his brother
are out to get me."

16:42.627 --> 16:44.629
Raul Salinas, the president's
brother in Mexico

16:44.713 --> 16:46.548
was a major drug dealer.

16:46.631 --> 16:48.633
And I says, "Guillermo,
run to the States,

16:48.717 --> 16:50.760
I'll hide you over here."

16:50.844 --> 16:52.721
And I hid him in Palm Springs.

16:55.348 --> 16:59.060
He told me that in favor
of me saving his life,

16:59.144 --> 17:01.855
he was now gonna
save my life.

17:01.938 --> 17:04.691
And I said, "How are you
gonna save my life?"

17:04.774 --> 17:08.027
He says, "Take this advice,"
and first he told me in Spanish.

17:08.111 --> 17:10.321
"Get out of this investigation,

17:10.405 --> 17:12.741
"you're just going to make
yourself stink, brother.

17:12.824 --> 17:16.077
"They don't want you to solve
the Camarena case.

17:16.161 --> 17:18.371
"Your own government
ordered him killed.

17:18.455 --> 17:21.332
"Don't you know that all the
cocaine coming in right now

17:21.416 --> 17:23.126
"is being brought
in by the CIA

17:23.209 --> 17:25.170
"to support that dirty war
in Nicaragua?

17:25.253 --> 17:28.131
Aren't you aware what
happened in Nicaragua?"

17:28.214 --> 17:30.133
I said, "Well, yeah,
the Sandonista government
took over."

17:30.216 --> 17:33.136
"Yeah, and who funded them?
Who supported them?

17:33.219 --> 17:34.804
"The Russians
and the damn Cubans.

17:34.888 --> 17:38.183
"And they overthrew
the Anastasio Somoza government.

17:38.266 --> 17:41.436
"The Contras are his old guard

17:41.519 --> 17:43.021
"and Felix Rodriguez,
and those guys

17:43.104 --> 17:45.940
"are arming them
with drug monies.

17:46.024 --> 17:47.400
You getting the picture?"

17:53.031 --> 17:55.742
He says Kiki Camarena
was picked up

17:55.825 --> 17:59.788
because they thought that
he was about to uncover

17:59.871 --> 18:04.667
the nexus of the CIA, DFS
together with the drug lords

18:04.751 --> 18:07.337
to fund a war

18:07.420 --> 18:10.215
which has not been
authorized in Nicaragua.

18:11.883 --> 18:14.219
The drug traffickers
were used.

18:15.553 --> 18:17.806
INTERVIEWER:
Mike Holm was there?
Mike Holm can corroborate that?

18:17.889 --> 18:19.390
BERRELLEZ:
Yes, he was.

18:19.474 --> 18:21.559
HOLM: Guillermo Calderoni
defected from

18:21.643 --> 18:23.853
the Mexican Federal
Judicial Police,

18:23.937 --> 18:26.606
and Hector linked up
with him in Palm Springs.

18:26.689 --> 18:31.319
He told us about
corruption in Mexico,

18:31.402 --> 18:33.279
and he also told Hector,

18:33.363 --> 18:36.407
"Stop investigating
the murder of Kiki Camarena,

18:36.491 --> 18:38.952
your government killed him."

18:44.207 --> 18:47.335
Hector Berrellez,
he was uncovering stuff

18:47.418 --> 18:49.963
that was unbelievable.

18:50.046 --> 18:53.800
He was putting it on
reports of investigation,

18:53.883 --> 18:56.177
we call them DEA 6's.

18:57.929 --> 19:01.266
BERRELLEZ: DEA 6's
are numbered, catalogued,

19:01.349 --> 19:03.476
they are investigative reports
that you cannot get rid of.

19:03.560 --> 19:06.604
Once you write it in a
DEA 6, it's set in stone,

19:06.688 --> 19:08.147
it cannot be destroyed.

19:09.732 --> 19:12.694
JORDAN:
Being in the senior
executive level,

19:12.777 --> 19:17.782
I know that he was told
to stop putting

19:17.866 --> 19:22.453
the involvement of CIA
operations into DEA 6's.

19:22.537 --> 19:25.498
Now, you put it in a memo,

19:25.582 --> 19:29.168
you can do the Ollie North
shuffle and shred.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.798
INTERVIEWER:
What was the reaction
when he brought back

19:33.882 --> 19:36.467
his findings
with regards to

19:36.551 --> 19:40.972
Felix Rodriguez' presence
at Camarena's torture?

19:42.473 --> 19:45.184
Classified,
don't get involved.

19:47.645 --> 19:49.898
"You don't have
the jurisdiction
to investigate him.

19:49.981 --> 19:52.442
You know,
he's with the CIA."

19:52.525 --> 19:54.903
"So, what do I do about him?"
"Write the memo,

19:54.986 --> 19:57.030
"send him up to
the Inspector General's office.

19:57.113 --> 19:59.949
"They have jurisdiction to
investigate that aspect of it.

20:00.033 --> 20:01.367
You just stay
with the drug lords."

20:04.621 --> 20:08.416
I'm naive, I'm dumb.
I figure "Okay, somebody's
gonna go after him."

20:11.920 --> 20:13.922
I have to tell you,
Hector sent information

20:14.005 --> 20:17.175
back to them in boxes.

20:17.258 --> 20:19.260
He sent them back
to DEA headquarters,

20:19.344 --> 20:21.930
they disappeared.

20:34.817 --> 20:36.527
BERRELLEZ:
So I flew into Washington

20:36.611 --> 20:38.696
and I met with
the Administrator.

20:40.156 --> 20:43.743
Jack Lawn, he asked me
if I could conduct

20:43.826 --> 20:46.663
an extraterritorial rendition.

20:46.746 --> 20:50.625
I looked at him
like I'm kinda dumb,
and I said, "What's that?"

20:50.708 --> 20:55.046
He kinda smiled
and he laughed a little bit,
and he goes "Kidnapping."

20:58.299 --> 21:00.176
"Yeah, I can do that."

21:03.096 --> 21:04.639
And he's kinda really
taking his time,

21:04.722 --> 21:07.725
just looking at me,
not saying much.

21:07.809 --> 21:09.519
I say, "Who do
you want kidnapped?

21:09.602 --> 21:11.479
Who do you want me to get?"

21:11.562 --> 21:14.315
He says, "Can you get
that doctor for me?"

21:14.399 --> 21:17.443
I said, "Humberto Machain?"

21:19.028 --> 21:21.114
MEDRANO:
Humberto Alvarez Machain

21:21.197 --> 21:24.701
was the physician
to the drug cartel.

21:24.784 --> 21:27.870
When the drug cartel leaders
would party,

21:27.954 --> 21:30.957
they'd party hard.

21:31.040 --> 21:32.500
It's not just
a three-hour party,

21:32.583 --> 21:35.795
they would party
every day for a week.

21:35.878 --> 21:38.881
And it was not
uncommon for someone

21:38.965 --> 21:42.176
at one of these
big parties to overdose.

21:42.260 --> 21:44.303
So, they would have
a physician present

21:44.387 --> 21:47.056
to assist that person.

21:47.140 --> 21:49.934
So, fast forward,
Agent Camarena is kidnapped,

21:50.018 --> 21:51.936
he's put in this small room

21:52.020 --> 21:55.398
at the house
at 881 Lope de Vega.

21:55.481 --> 21:58.860
He is beaten,
he is tortured.

21:58.943 --> 22:01.696
And the body
can only take so much,

22:01.779 --> 22:04.657
so he would lapse
into unconsciousness.

22:04.741 --> 22:07.744
Humberto Alvarez Machain
was brought in

22:07.827 --> 22:12.081
and he would administer
medication to Camarena

22:12.165 --> 22:16.627
to revive him so
the torture could continue.

22:21.299 --> 22:25.428
BERRELLEZ:
Jack Lawn asked me,
"Can you get him?"

22:25.511 --> 22:27.388
"Absolutely, I can get him.
He's easy.

22:27.472 --> 22:29.307
Why don't we go after
some bigger fish?"

22:29.390 --> 22:31.684
He said, "No, no, no, no, no,"
just like that.

22:31.768 --> 22:34.062
"How would you do it?"

22:34.145 --> 22:35.646
"How would I do it?

22:35.730 --> 22:37.065
"I'd hire
the Mexicans to do it,

22:37.148 --> 22:39.067
"I'd hire
Comandantes to do it.

22:39.150 --> 22:40.860
"Pay them money the way
the traffickers do.

22:40.943 --> 22:42.695
"Pay them money,
they'll-- they'll--

22:42.779 --> 22:45.281
they'll kidnap the President
for the right amount of money."

22:45.364 --> 22:47.742
"How much would he cost?"

22:47.825 --> 22:50.453
"Not much.
I can probably do it

22:50.536 --> 22:53.456
for about $250,000,
a quarter of a million."

22:53.539 --> 22:58.252
He said, "Okay, do it.
I want it done."

23:00.630 --> 23:03.883
So I started calling
comandantes that I know.

23:03.966 --> 23:06.636
And I know this comandante.

23:06.719 --> 23:10.556
I set up a meeting with him
in El Paso, Texas.

23:12.016 --> 23:14.060
And I said "Can you
kidnap this guy for me?"

23:14.143 --> 23:16.729
He says, "Yeah, absolutely,
I can do it."

23:16.813 --> 23:21.234
"Will you do it for $250,000?"
He said, "Yeah."

23:22.902 --> 23:24.445
About two weeks later
he calls me up and he says,

23:24.529 --> 23:26.197
"Hey," he says, "You know
how we're gonna get him?

23:26.280 --> 23:28.825
He likes
young beautiful girls."

23:28.908 --> 23:30.868
And I said,
"Yeah, let's do that.

23:30.952 --> 23:33.538
Hire a couple
of prostitutes."

23:33.621 --> 23:39.085
They called me and they said,
"Okay, it's all set up."

23:39.168 --> 23:40.670
So, they cordoned off
a whole block

23:40.753 --> 23:43.673
around the clinic
with police roadblock.

23:43.756 --> 23:47.385
The girls went in there.

23:47.468 --> 23:49.887
When the doctor shows up,
signal goes off,

23:49.971 --> 23:51.639
and they go in
and take him

23:51.722 --> 23:53.891
and they put him
in a hotel room.

23:55.434 --> 23:56.811
From the hotel room,
they called me,

23:56.894 --> 23:58.312
and they said, "We got him."

23:58.396 --> 24:01.482
I says, "Get a pilot
and get him to El Paso."

24:04.443 --> 24:06.154
So, when I get there,
I go to the tower

24:06.237 --> 24:08.990
and I tell them,
"DEA, Special Operations.

24:09.073 --> 24:12.368
This plane is going to land,
let him land."

24:12.451 --> 24:14.370
And, of course FAA,
"We can't do that,

24:14.453 --> 24:16.664
and customs and anybody,
we can't--"

24:16.747 --> 24:19.917
I says, "You're gonna do it,
I don't want to hear no shit.

24:20.001 --> 24:23.254
"This is a very
special operation being
planned out of headquarters,

24:23.337 --> 24:26.340
Please guys, don't give me
any crap, let him land."

24:26.424 --> 24:28.593
They said, "Okay, okay,"
and they finally backed off.

24:28.676 --> 24:32.680
So, we're there
at the airport
and the plane lands.

24:32.763 --> 24:35.766
And before it even stopped,
the door opens,

24:35.850 --> 24:39.604
and then I see this big fat guy
being pushed out of the plane.

24:39.687 --> 24:41.939
The plane doesn't even stop.

24:42.023 --> 24:44.442
They close the gate up again
and the plane takes off again.

24:44.525 --> 24:46.986
Good, south to Mexico.

24:47.069 --> 24:49.614
And this guy's
laying there on the tarmac.

24:49.697 --> 24:52.700
So I walk up,
got my DEA badge.

24:52.783 --> 24:55.953
"Dr. Machain,
Hector Berrellez,
pleased to meet you.

24:56.037 --> 24:57.288
Get up!"

25:10.968 --> 25:15.473
REPORTER #1: Ruben Zuno Arce,
brother-in-law to former
Mexican President Echeverria,

25:15.556 --> 25:19.018
was arrested as
a material witness
in San Antonio last week.

25:19.101 --> 25:21.938
DEA agents believe

25:22.021 --> 25:24.649
that Zuno has information
about the murder.

25:24.732 --> 25:28.027
REPORTER #2:
Ruben Zuno Arce has ties
to the drug traffickers

25:28.110 --> 25:30.071
who tortured
and killed Camarena.

25:30.154 --> 25:31.739
REPORTER #1:
Attorneys for Zuno

25:31.822 --> 25:34.158
deny any drug involvement
by their client.

25:37.286 --> 25:41.123
MEDRANO:
Ruben Zuno Arce was the owner
of 881 Lope de Vega.

25:41.207 --> 25:44.794
We had numerous informants
who described Ruben Zuno Arce

25:44.877 --> 25:49.507
as a drug dealer himself
and in bed with the drug cartel.

25:51.092 --> 25:53.469
Ruben Zuno Arce was
the brother-in-law

25:53.552 --> 25:55.596
of one of the former
presidents of Mexico.

25:55.680 --> 25:59.600
That shows you how high
the Zuno Arce tentacles

25:59.684 --> 26:01.894
reached into
the Mexican government.

26:01.978 --> 26:03.980
Let there be
no question about this.

26:04.063 --> 26:07.608
The evidence against
Ruben Zuno Arce
was overwhelming.

27:11.630 --> 27:15.176
JORDAN:
You have a DEA agent,

27:15.259 --> 27:18.512
who was the supervisor
of Kiki Camarena,

27:18.596 --> 27:22.933
testify in federal court
that Zuno Arce

27:23.017 --> 27:25.811
was really not
in the dope business.

27:25.895 --> 27:29.857
I cannot believe that
right there and then--

27:29.940 --> 27:33.903
That son of a bitch
should've been out.

27:33.986 --> 27:36.030
He should not have been
a DEA agent.

27:36.113 --> 27:39.450
This is
Kiki Camarena's supervisor.

27:43.454 --> 27:45.039
And he testifies to the fact

27:45.122 --> 27:47.416
that Ruben Zuno
is not a drug dealer.

27:47.500 --> 27:50.086
We are shocked.

27:50.169 --> 27:53.547
HOLM: He testified
under oath in trial,

27:53.631 --> 27:58.010
and the assistant US attorney
was just apoplectic.

27:59.470 --> 28:02.807
BERRELLEZ: After he testifies,
we take a little break.

28:02.890 --> 28:05.559
While we're in the elevator,
Manny Medrano, the AUSA,

28:05.643 --> 28:08.437
gets his briefcase
and he slams it
on the elevator floor

28:08.521 --> 28:12.108
and he says, "Hector,
take your gun out
and shoot me right now.

28:12.191 --> 28:14.193
"We're gonna lose this case!

28:14.276 --> 28:16.987
"He's supposed
to be on our side.
He's Kiki's supervisor.

28:17.071 --> 28:18.823
He's gonna taint
the whole jury."

28:23.744 --> 28:28.582
Then I've got the CIA
receiving money from Fonseca,

28:28.666 --> 28:30.876
and arming Fonseca
and the drug lords,

28:30.960 --> 28:33.671
and using
Caro Quintero's ranch.

28:33.754 --> 28:35.214
Then I've got my own
government saying,

28:35.297 --> 28:36.841
"Oh, don't report that.

28:36.924 --> 28:39.927
Don't do DEA 6s on this,
that and the other."

28:40.010 --> 28:43.097
There's layers
and layers of this case.

28:46.475 --> 28:49.270
We told Hector,

28:49.353 --> 28:51.689
"They are going to shut down
your investigation..."

28:52.773 --> 28:54.525
He says, "Why?"

28:54.608 --> 28:58.571
"Because the CIA and the DEA
are mixed up in this.

29:00.114 --> 29:04.994
"They are allied
with the Narcos,
and with politicians,

29:05.077 --> 29:08.330
and with
the Mexican government."

29:08.414 --> 29:10.082
But Hector didn't
believe us then.

29:10.166 --> 29:12.042
He told us, "No way."

29:13.210 --> 29:15.504
And he got very pissed off.

29:15.588 --> 29:20.134
"No fucking way bastards,
this is not Mexico!

29:20.217 --> 29:22.178
"Whoever deserves to
fall will fall.

29:22.261 --> 29:23.846
"If the President himself
was involved in this,

29:23.929 --> 29:27.308
I'm going to
fuck him up myself."

29:27.391 --> 29:30.144
I said, "Fine,

29:30.227 --> 29:33.022
if you say so."

29:55.711 --> 29:57.755
REPORTER: The drug war had
Vice President Dan Quayle

29:57.838 --> 30:00.758
in a tense meeting today
with Mexico's President Salinas.

30:00.841 --> 30:03.802
The issue, the abduction
of a Mexican doctor

30:03.886 --> 30:05.638
to stand trial
in the United States

30:05.721 --> 30:07.681
in connection with
the torture and murder

30:07.765 --> 30:09.642
of an American drug agent.

30:09.725 --> 30:13.854
President Salinas
expressed to me

30:13.938 --> 30:18.275
his strong displeasure
with the Dr. Alvarez incident.

30:18.359 --> 30:22.905
There were no DEA agents
in Mexico

30:22.988 --> 30:26.534
who are involved
in this particular situation.

30:26.617 --> 30:30.538
REPORTER: The head of
the DEA said hard feelings
can be smoothed over.

30:30.621 --> 30:33.123
There will be some
report forthcoming
in the next couple of days

30:33.207 --> 30:35.292
that will totally resolve
this matter.

30:35.376 --> 30:40.339
BERRELLEZ: Next thing I know,
I'm under investigation myself.

30:42.132 --> 30:45.177
"DEA agent,
Hector Berrellez, Kidnapper."

30:45.928 --> 30:47.888
"Kidnapped a doctor without
headquarters' knowledge

30:47.972 --> 30:50.474
or authorization.
Wanted man."

30:53.143 --> 30:56.105
I was there,
I was the lead prosecutor.

30:56.188 --> 30:59.149
We did our job,
we followed the rules,
followed the law.

30:59.233 --> 31:01.735
So, anything that happened
in this case,

31:01.819 --> 31:05.447
including kidnappings
of bad guys from
foreign jurisdictions,

31:05.531 --> 31:09.577
was entirely authorized
by the American government.

31:09.660 --> 31:11.120
I want to be very clear
about that,

31:11.203 --> 31:14.123
because that's how
it all came down.

31:27.469 --> 31:29.388
REPORTER:
Dr. Humberto Alvarez Machain

31:29.471 --> 31:32.141
was released last week
by a federal judge.

31:32.224 --> 31:36.270
After the judge's ruling,
Dr. Alvarez broke down
and cried.

31:36.353 --> 31:38.981
He hugged and thanked
his lawyers.

31:39.064 --> 31:43.235
HOLM:
Then the plane
that belonged to

31:43.319 --> 31:45.696
the Mexican Attorney General
flew to Los Angeles

31:45.779 --> 31:49.742
and picked up Machain
and flew him back to Mexico.

31:51.744 --> 31:55.247
BERRELLEZ:
He was treated like a hero.

31:55.331 --> 31:58.375
Next day was a
"David and Goliath"
story in Mexico,

31:58.459 --> 32:01.128
that he beat the case
in the United States.

32:01.211 --> 32:03.172
He beat Goliath.

32:30.741 --> 32:34.203
BERRELLEZ:
So, I was transferred back
to Washington, DC,

32:34.286 --> 32:37.623
and was given
a desk and a phone.

32:37.706 --> 32:41.001
Really no job,
not a real serious job.

32:41.085 --> 32:44.004
They just said,
"This is where you're
going to work in DC.

32:44.088 --> 32:46.715
"We don't want you contacting
any of your sources.

32:46.799 --> 32:51.470
No more contact
with your witnesses."

32:51.553 --> 32:53.931
So here I am.

32:54.014 --> 32:57.226
I don't know
what's gonna happen to me,
and I'm very fearful.

32:57.309 --> 33:00.145
I'm not fearful
that the traffickers
are gonna kill me,

33:00.229 --> 33:02.773
I'm fearful
that my own government
is gonna kill me.

33:04.400 --> 33:06.527
INTERVIEWER:
Did Hector know too much?

33:06.610 --> 33:10.572
JORDAN: Yes. Hector,
to this day...

33:10.656 --> 33:14.326
knows too much.

33:24.253 --> 33:27.256
BERRELLEZ: Before I left
the agency, I was visited by

33:27.339 --> 33:30.175
a supposedly
very high-up CIA official.

33:30.259 --> 33:32.177
And he told me,
"Hector, you see,

33:32.261 --> 33:36.765
"the CIA is not
a law enforcement agency.

33:36.849 --> 33:41.311
"We are not bound

33:41.395 --> 33:45.149
"by Constitutional law.

33:45.232 --> 33:51.655
"Our job is to protect
the United States

33:51.739 --> 33:54.491
from foreign enemies."

33:54.575 --> 33:58.162
And he says, "So listen,
you be a good soldier,

33:58.245 --> 34:01.248
"you don't want to
piss off your own government.

34:01.331 --> 34:05.711
"Just keep all this stuff about
the CIA bringing in drugs,

34:05.794 --> 34:10.716
"the CIA, you know, being
complicit in Kiki's murder
that you allege.

34:10.799 --> 34:15.429
"You can't prove it anyway,
so you might as well
just keep it all quiet.

34:15.512 --> 34:18.724
"Have a nice life,
enjoy your retirement.

34:18.807 --> 34:22.811
"Because, remember,
if you upset this government,

34:22.895 --> 34:26.440
"you still have
that warrant in Mexico.

34:26.523 --> 34:28.317
"You might find yourself
in a Mexican prison,

34:28.400 --> 34:30.277
"and you know you won't
last a week there.

34:30.360 --> 34:33.739
"So if I was you,
mum is the word.

34:33.822 --> 34:35.699
That's all I have
to say to you."

34:35.783 --> 34:38.494
And I said,
"Thank you, have a nice day."

34:48.378 --> 34:51.048
I felt totally betrayed
by the DEA.

34:51.131 --> 34:54.676
Totally, totally betrayed.

34:54.760 --> 34:56.762
There's never been
a war on drugs.

34:56.845 --> 35:00.098
It's all a fallacy.
It's all a facade.

35:00.182 --> 35:03.060
Our politicians get up,
"Oh, we're gonna fight drugs,

35:03.143 --> 35:06.605
we're gonna stop
the drug flows from
coming into the country."

35:06.688 --> 35:08.774
That's not true.

35:08.857 --> 35:12.194
They deal drugs themselves
to support their
black operations,

35:12.277 --> 35:14.905
to support their wars
that are not authorized.

35:18.116 --> 35:21.370
There were many injustices
done to him.

35:21.453 --> 35:23.705
I could really feel
Hector's sorrow.

35:25.624 --> 35:27.751
BERRELLEZ:
You miss your kids,
you miss not being there

35:27.835 --> 35:30.087
for football games,
school events,

35:30.170 --> 35:34.591
they sing at the--
with the choir on Christmas
and you're not there.

35:34.675 --> 35:36.885
Sometimes you'll be gone
seven months out of a year,

35:36.969 --> 35:40.097
and your family was
by themselves in the States.

35:40.180 --> 35:43.100
And, I suffered for it later,

35:43.183 --> 35:48.063
I had one of my sons
take his life.

35:48.146 --> 35:49.606
He shot himself.

35:58.282 --> 36:01.410
My son was destroyed,
my poor Hector.

36:03.787 --> 36:05.205
INTERVIEWER: Do you
blame yourself for that?

36:05.289 --> 36:07.124
-BERRELLEZ: I do.
-INTERVIEWER: Why?

36:07.207 --> 36:09.877
Because his last words
were, "Nobody loves me."

36:09.960 --> 36:14.381
And I felt I didn't show him
enough love as a little boy.

36:14.464 --> 36:18.051
I was absent
in his life too much.

36:18.135 --> 36:21.221
He was a hell of
a baseball player,

36:21.305 --> 36:23.849
and I was never there
for his games.

36:54.630 --> 36:58.759
INTERVIEWER:
What were you saying
about Camarena's ghost?

36:59.968 --> 37:02.804
Give me some time...

37:09.353 --> 37:11.104
It's just...

37:11.188 --> 37:13.357
Enrique Camarena.

37:16.318 --> 37:19.154
He represents
all the spirits behind me.

37:22.532 --> 37:25.661
They are with me every day.

37:25.744 --> 37:28.830
And now I feel them,
with all their energy.

37:28.914 --> 37:31.792
Here, we have him on our side.

37:31.875 --> 37:34.336
And behind him,

37:34.419 --> 37:36.922
there are some souls,

37:37.005 --> 37:39.299
grim souls...

37:39.716 --> 37:44.513
asking the Lord
for divine justice.

37:51.228 --> 37:53.146
(indistinct chatter)

37:57.401 --> 38:02.572
MIKA CAMARENA:
I want to know why
our government let Kiki down.

38:02.656 --> 38:08.036
One of their best agents...

38:08.120 --> 38:10.539
and they let him down.

38:12.791 --> 38:14.710
JORDAN: He was a friend.

38:14.793 --> 38:17.129
And he was a good friend,
he was a working friend,

38:17.212 --> 38:21.258
he was one of the guys
that you would
want on your team

38:21.341 --> 38:23.051
if you were
gonna hit a house.

38:23.135 --> 38:26.263
Kiki was a Marine.

38:26.346 --> 38:29.224
And they did him.

38:35.480 --> 38:38.942
INTERVIEWER:
What are you thinking?

38:40.652 --> 38:43.363
(sighs)

38:43.447 --> 38:46.116
Of the torture.

38:48.243 --> 38:51.163
The guy didn't have a chance.

38:56.084 --> 38:59.546
The betrayal,

38:59.629 --> 39:04.468
which makes it even harder...

39:07.637 --> 39:10.640
to comprehend.

39:12.642 --> 39:14.561
I can't believe it.

39:14.644 --> 39:16.980
I can't believe, uh,

39:17.064 --> 39:19.733
that this really,
really happened.

39:23.278 --> 39:24.863
But it did.

39:24.946 --> 39:27.199
It did,
it did happen.

39:32.079 --> 39:35.207
INTERVIEWER:
Why are you talking now?

39:35.290 --> 39:39.920
BERRELLEZ: Well, now I'm
talking because the warrant
in Mexico has expired.

39:40.003 --> 39:43.215
They can't send me
to Mexico any more.

39:43.298 --> 39:45.926
I'm getting older,

39:46.009 --> 39:50.013
and I've had this little
thorn in my heart,

39:50.097 --> 39:52.224
knowing the truth of
what really happened to Kiki.

39:52.307 --> 39:55.560
I want the world
to know the truth.

39:55.644 --> 40:00.357
It's time.
I don't want to carry this
to the grave with me.

40:00.440 --> 40:02.901
And now, if they kill me,
well, okay,

40:02.984 --> 40:07.155
I've had a great life.
And they might still kill me.

40:07.239 --> 40:12.494
I am not gonna quit this,
I'm gonna be on this crusade

40:12.577 --> 40:15.831
of putting out
the true story 'til I die.

40:15.914 --> 40:21.294
And if I die doing it,
well that's-- that's
what God wanted.

40:28.969 --> 40:32.097
(telephone rings)

40:38.854 --> 40:42.149
(ringing continues)

44:19.366 --> 44:22.827
GODOY:
Camarena wasn't killed
by a single person.

44:23.161 --> 44:25.330
Camarena was killed
by many people.

44:25.413 --> 44:29.918
He was killed by
politicians, police officers,

44:31.211 --> 44:34.631
by the military, by Narcos,

44:34.714 --> 44:37.050
by the CIA.

44:37.717 --> 44:42.722
Enrique Camarena was just
a fucking sacrificial goat.

44:45.016 --> 44:46.476
Just a sacrificial goat.
