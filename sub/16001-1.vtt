10:58.041 --> 11:00.083
YOU NEED SOME HELP?

11:00.166 --> 11:02.792
NO, WE DON'T NEED ANY HELP!

11:02.875 --> 11:05.542
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE?

11:05.625 --> 11:07.834
YOU'RE A SERIAL MONOGAMIST.

12:55.000 --> 12:58.625

12:58.750 --> 13:01.041
I BROKE UP WITH CAR GIRL.

13:01.125 --> 13:03.333

13:18.834 --> 13:20.083
MAYBE I STILL CAN'T DO ANYTHING.

13:20.166 --> 13:22.709
NO, YOU CAN. ADAM'S NOT GONNA CARE.

13:22.792 --> 13:24.792
HE'LL HAVE A NEW GIRL INSIDE OF A WEEK.

DID YOU READ MY PROPOSAL?
NO, I DIDN'T, AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M NOT GOING TO.

13:43.834 --> 13:46.750
I'M NOT A SELLOUT.
THEY WANNA BUY THE GAME.
THEY WANNA DISTRIBUTE IT.

13:46.834 --> 13:49.333
THEY DON'T JUST WANT THE GAME.
THEY WANT ZAP MONKEY.

13:49.458 --> 13:51.709
THEY WANT US, OKAY? THEY WANNA
CRACK OPEN OUR SKULLS,

13:51.792 --> 13:54.041
SCOOP OUT THE BRAINS AND TURN US
INTO CORPORATE ZOMBIES.

13:54.166 --> 13:56.000
I'M NOT A ZOMBIE. I'M AN INDEPENDENT,
DEEP IN MY SOUL.

13:56.083 --> 13:57.792

14:05.750 --> 14:07.041
ADAM, HEY, I DID IT.

14:07.166 --> 14:09.041

14:14.375 --> 14:16.417
(Deena) HEY!

14:16.500 --> 14:18.667

HI, SWEETIE. WHAT HAPPENED?

14:23.000 --> 14:24.500
UM... WHAT HAPPENED?

14:24.625 --> 14:25.500
(chuckles)

14:25.625 --> 14:26.625
THIS.

14:26.709 --> 14:28.667
OH, MY GOD!

14:28.750 --> 14:30.375
YOU GOT ENGAGED?

14:30.500 --> 14:32.458
OH, MY GOD! CONGRATULATIONS.
(Marjorie) THANK YOU.

14:32.542 --> 14:37.375

14:41.667 --> 14:43.417
BRAVO! MWAH!

14:43.542 --> 14:44.917
CONGRATULATIONS.

14:45.041 --> 14:46.417
HEY.

14:46.542 --> 14:49.542

14:49.625 --> 14:53.333
(lowers voice) DID NOT SEE THAT COMING.

14:58.291 --> 15:01.500
OH, AND THEN THERE WAS ONE.

15:07.709 --> 15:09.500
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY
YOU'RE DOING THIS, YOU KNOW?

15:09.583 --> 15:12.000
(high-pitched voice) SAY NIGHT-NIGHT.

15:12.083 --> 15:15.125
(both) NIGHT-NIGHT.

15:15.208 --> 15:16.709
(crying) HOW CAN YOU SIT HERE

15:16.834 --> 15:18.417
AND SAY "NIGHT-NIGHT" LIKE THAT?

15:18.500 --> 15:20.375
WELL, I SAID "NIGHT-NIGHT"
AND YOU SAID "NIGHT-NIGHT."

15:20.458 --> 15:22.750
(Deena) WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY'RE SAYING?

15:22.875 --> 15:23.917
"WE COULD STILL BE FRIENDS,"

15:24.000 --> 15:25.917
ALL THAT HORRIBLE BREAKUP STUFF.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.542
"IT'S NOT YOU, CAR GIRL. IT'S ME."

15:29.625 --> 15:31.875
THEY'RE STILL TALKING, HUH?

15:31.959 --> 15:34.500
YEAH.

15:34.583 --> 15:36.667
(shouting)

15:36.750 --> 15:39.750
DO YOU SEE HOW ONE BREAST
IS BIGGER THAN THE OTHER?
YOU'RE KILLING ME!

15:39.875 --> 15:41.250
THE RIGHT ONE.

15:41.375 --> 15:42.417
BINGO.

15:42.500 --> 15:44.959
DON'T CRY. LISTEN, KAREN, KAREN, KAREN.

15:45.083 --> 15:46.625
IT'S THIS WAY.

15:49.917 --> 15:54.500
(gate creaks open, shuts)

16:00.875 --> 16:02.959
COME HERE.

16:03.041 --> 16:06.291
COME ON.

16:06.417 --> 16:09.291
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE PACT?!

16:09.417 --> 16:11.333
DON'T EVER THINK I'D GO BACK ON A PACT,

16:11.458 --> 16:13.875
ESPECIALLY WITH YOU, BRI.
I DIDN'T MAKE THE PACT.

16:13.959 --> 16:16.959
(clenches teeth)
I BROKE UP WITH HER. JEEZ!

16:17.041 --> 16:21.000
LAST NIGHT, I DID IT, AND SHE WAS STELLAR.

16:21.125 --> 16:26.125
I MEAN, SHE WAS LIKE A GUY.
SHE WAS STOIC, CLASSY.

16:26.250 --> 16:29.125
YOU KNOW, THE NEXT MORNING,
I WAKE UP, I'M LOOKING AT HER,

16:29.208 --> 16:31.125
AND SHE LOOKED SO GREAT WEARING

16:31.208 --> 16:34.125
THIS CUTE LITTLE WHITE T-SHIRT
THING SHE WEARS TO BED,

16:34.208 --> 16:36.125
AND I DON'T KNOW. I'M THINKING TO MYSELF,

16:36.208 --> 16:38.792
"WHAT THE HELL AM I DOING?"

16:38.917 --> 16:41.083
I LOVE THIS GIRL.

16:41.166 --> 16:42.875
AND, YOU KNOW, BEFORE I KNOW IT,

16:43.000 --> 16:47.375
WE'RE CRYING AND HAVING, LIKE,
THE BEST SEX OF OUR LIVES,

16:47.500 --> 16:53.375
AND THEN WE WENT OUT AND... BOUGHT A RING.

16:53.500 --> 16:56.083
SHE'S A...

16:56.166 --> 16:58.208
REALLY GREAT GIRL.

16:58.333 --> 17:00.291
YEAH, SEE, THAT'S THE THING.

17:00.375 --> 17:02.208
EVERYONE LOVES HER. EVEN YOU LOVE HER.

17:02.333 --> 17:05.417
I MEAN, WHAT KIND OF IDIOT
WOULD I BE TO LET HER GO?

17:05.500 --> 17:07.542
A BIG IDIOT.

17:07.667 --> 17:10.500
WILL YOU BE MY BEST MAN?

17:12.375 --> 17:13.375
YEAH.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.792
(both chuckling)

17:15.875 --> 17:17.458
DID YOU CALL YOUR MOM?

17:17.542 --> 17:20.333
FORGOT TO CALL MY MOM.

17:21.875 --> 17:23.625
MARRIAGE IS COOL, MAN.

17:23.709 --> 17:26.375
YOU KNOW, YOU GOT THE WHOLE
COMMITMENT THING. THAT'S GREAT.

17:26.500 --> 17:28.208
THE KIDS-- THEY'RE AWESOME, YOU KNOW?

17:28.333 --> 17:30.208
ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE NOT INTO HAVING SEX.

17:30.333 --> 17:32.375
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, WHEN YOU'RE
MARRIED, YOU DON'T HAVE SEX.

17:32.458 --> 17:34.875
I BET YOU HAVE MORE SEX THAN ME.

17:34.959 --> 17:36.875
WE HAVEN'T HAD SEX FOR-- WELL, LET'S SEE.

17:36.959 --> 17:38.458
CARRIE'S 6 MONTHS OLD,

17:38.542 --> 17:40.417
SO... SIX MONTHS.

17:40.542 --> 17:42.000
(chuckles)

17:42.083 --> 17:44.542
YOU HAVEN'T HAD SEX FOR SIX MONTHS?

17:44.625 --> 17:46.375
LAST TIME WE DID, DEENA WAS PREGNANT.

17:46.500 --> 17:48.875
YOU KNOW, LET'S GET
THE WHOLE LABOR THING GOING.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.875
IT'S NOT EXACTLY EROTIC, MY MAN.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.709
MORE THAN I WANTED TO KNOW.

17:52.834 --> 17:54.375
YEAH. IT'S WEIRD. IT HAPPENS.

18:21.458 --> 18:25.125
DON'T COME DOWN HERE.
JUST DON'T EVEN TRY IT.

18:25.250 --> 18:26.792
WHAT?

18:26.917 --> 18:29.000
I DON'T WANNA TALK TO YOU.

18:29.083 --> 18:31.208
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
DON'T TRY TO "BRIAN" ME EITHER.

18:31.291 --> 18:34.208
I SEE RIGHT THROUGH THAT.
IT MIGHT WORK ON CAR GIRL.

18:34.291 --> 18:36.208
IT'S NOT GONNA WORK ON ME.

18:36.291 --> 18:40.083
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.917
HE TOLD ME ABOUT THE PACT.

18:45.041 --> 18:46.959
HE SAID THAT YOU TRIED TO GET HIM

18:47.041 --> 18:49.458
TO MAKE A PACT TO BREAK UP WITH ME.

18:49.542 --> 18:51.125
H-HE SAID THAT?

18:54.417 --> 18:56.875
DID YOU THINK THAT
HE<i> SHOULD </i>BREAK UP WITH ME?

18:56.959 --> 18:58.667
I MEAN, WHAT AM I TO YOU? AM I...

18:58.792 --> 19:01.208
AM I LIKE CAR GIRL?
WHAT'S MY NAME--DOCTOR GIRL?

19:01.291 --> 19:03.959
NO. GOD, NO. 'CAUSE I SAW THE LOOK
ON YOUR FACE

AND YOU WERE SHOCKED.

19:06.625 --> 19:08.375
IT WASN'T SHOCK.

19:08.458 --> 19:09.917
YES, IT WAS.

HE MUST REALLY HAVE SOMETHING.

21:26.375 --> 21:28.417
