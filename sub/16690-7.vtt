00:02.803 --> 00:03.837
Tonight on
Kitchen Nightmares...

00:03.904 --> 00:05.539
Chef Ramsay heads
to Rhode Island

00:05.605 --> 00:07.708
and finds an owner
in complete denial.

00:07.774 --> 00:10.110
I absolutely think
you're full of.

00:10.177 --> 00:10.944
Her restaurant may be
failing...

00:11.044 --> 00:12.679
Dreamer!

00:12.746 --> 00:13.814
But from the minute Chef Ramsay
sets foot in the door,

00:13.880 --> 00:15.282
Owner Abby battles him...

00:15.349 --> 00:17.584
That was embarrassing.
That's impossible.

00:17.651 --> 00:18.819
Every step of the way.

00:18.885 --> 00:19.987
Bring it on.

00:20.053 --> 00:21.355
This hot-headed owner

00:21.421 --> 00:23.090
Seems incapable of listening...

00:23.156 --> 00:24.791
- Listen to me!
-  I'm not gonna listen to your.

00:24.858 --> 00:27.094
Not just to Chef Ramsay,
but also her staff...

00:27.160 --> 00:28.161
As long as you work
for me,

00:28.228 --> 00:29.930
you do it my way.
enough said.

00:29.997 --> 00:30.000
If you cannot follow my rules,
then get the  out.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.199
If you cannot follow my rules,
then get the  out.

00:32.266 --> 00:34.201
And even comments
from her customers.

00:34.268 --> 00:37.904
- They're not  raw!
- He's full of!

00:37.971 --> 00:39.640
Abby is a complete
psycho bitch.

00:39.706 --> 00:41.775
Can Chef Ramsay get through
to this stubborn owner?

00:41.842 --> 00:44.411
Abby, you've got to understand
how frustrating this is.

00:44.478 --> 00:45.912
Fix it. You fix it.

00:45.979 --> 00:47.681
You stuck up,
precious little bitch!

00:47.748 --> 00:51.018
Or will this defiant,
proud woman be so delusional...

00:51.084 --> 00:52.519
You are insane!
You are insane!

00:52.586 --> 00:54.721
All you want!
You are insane!

00:54.788 --> 00:56.390
I'm insane?
You're insane!

00:56.456 --> 00:58.892
That she chases her
one last hope out the door?

00:58.959 --> 01:00.000
Just get the  out of my restaurant!
You want me to go?

01:00.000 --> 01:00.961
Just get the  out of my restaurant!
You want me to go?

01:01.028 --> 01:02.663
Get the  out of my restaurant please!
I will go.

01:02.729 --> 01:04.498
If you're looking for
a peaceful evening...

01:04.564 --> 01:06.733
Are you still here?
Not now, guys, please.

01:06.800 --> 01:08.035
This is the one kitchen
nightmares

01:08.135 --> 01:10.103
you might want to avoid.

01:10.170 --> 01:11.038
I would rather
this restaurant close

01:11.138 --> 01:13.206
than have him in here.

01:35.429 --> 01:38.265
Providence, Rhode Island,
home to seven colleges

01:38.332 --> 01:39.700
and a thriving art scene.

01:39.766 --> 01:43.904
This renaissance city is
a constant beehive of activity.

01:43.970 --> 01:47.841
In 2005, Abby
and her best friend Rico

01:47.908 --> 01:49.776
bought a restaurant
called Down City,

01:49.843 --> 01:52.145
smack in the center
of town.

01:52.212 --> 01:54.614
Rico and I were
on the beach one day,

01:54.681 --> 01:59.920
And I told him that I was
interested in buying Down City.

01:59.986 --> 02:00.000
And he said, "I want to own
a restaurant too."

02:00.000 --> 02:02.255
And he said, "I want to own
a restaurant too."

02:02.322 --> 02:05.525
I was spending a lot of money
in restaurants

02:05.592 --> 02:06.993
eating and drinking,

02:07.060 --> 02:10.931
and I figured why not
give myself the money instead?

02:10.997 --> 02:11.932
Make it a double.

02:11.998 --> 02:13.834
He has a full-time
day job,

02:13.900 --> 02:17.771
an my job is to take care of
everything in this restaurant.

02:17.838 --> 02:18.839
You start with
all the specials,

02:18.905 --> 02:20.540
I'm gonna get the wine.
okay.

02:20.607 --> 02:22.676
I've been in the restaurant
business for 33 years,

02:22.809 --> 02:24.544
So the decisions I make,

02:24.611 --> 02:26.747
I really don't consult Rico
about them, I just do them.

02:26.813 --> 02:29.116
And this would go perfectly
with the pork special.

02:31.184 --> 02:34.721
And I was putting
100% of my faith in Abby.

02:34.788 --> 02:37.858
But at this point,
it's not going well.

02:37.924 --> 02:40.327
I need more asses
in the seats.

02:40.394 --> 02:42.429
I think it's
a beautiful restaurant.

02:42.496 --> 02:45.265
I think our menu is creative,
and the food is good.

02:45.332 --> 02:46.400
I don't know what's wrong.

02:46.466 --> 02:48.268
It's all  up.

02:48.335 --> 02:52.105
Abby has a blindfold on because
she doesn't want to admit

02:52.172 --> 02:54.007
that she's part
of the problem.

02:54.074 --> 02:55.609
Just give him--
no, let me do it.

02:55.675 --> 02:57.144
Abby acts like...

02:57.210 --> 03:00.000
Whatever! Don't argue!
Cruella de vil.

03:00.000 --> 03:00.347
Whatever! Don't argue!
Cruella de vil.

03:00.414 --> 03:02.582
I just want an answer
when I call something out!

03:02.649 --> 03:05.652
Abby is a complete
psycho  bitch...

03:05.719 --> 03:06.953
I just want an answer!

03:07.020 --> 03:09.923
Which is a recipe
for utter disaster.

03:09.990 --> 03:11.825
I am fixing it.
I checked it before I left.

03:11.892 --> 03:13.827
Is this really
happening?

03:13.894 --> 03:15.362
I'm not yelling.
I'm talking.

03:15.429 --> 03:17.964
They think that this is
a democracy, and it's not.

03:18.031 --> 03:19.566
If you cannot follow my rules,
then get the  out.

03:19.633 --> 03:22.302
As long as you work for me,
you do it my way. Enough said.

03:22.369 --> 03:24.371
It's basically Abby's way
or the highway.

03:24.438 --> 03:26.606
And it's definitely why
her restaurant's failing.

03:26.706 --> 03:29.209
Welcome to my nightmare.

03:32.646 --> 03:33.980
If people are complaining
about the food,

03:34.047 --> 03:35.215
maybe there's something wrong
with the food.

03:35.282 --> 03:36.983
It is impossible for the fries
to be ice cold!

03:37.050 --> 03:38.652
Maybe just Abby saying
it's great

03:38.718 --> 03:40.086
does not make it great.

03:40.153 --> 03:41.788
That's how the plate
is prepared.

03:41.855 --> 03:43.290
Do you not like it?
No?

03:43.356 --> 03:46.593
She built this 50-item menu
that is just horrible.

03:46.660 --> 03:48.595
They hate the chicken paillard.
What?

03:48.662 --> 03:50.564
Nobody can say anything about
the menu because it's her menu.

03:50.630 --> 03:52.098
She takes it personally.

03:52.165 --> 03:55.101
Maybe they're not
the right decisions,

03:55.168 --> 03:57.971
but they'Remy
decisions.

03:58.038 --> 04:00.000
I have to get Abby on board
to move forward

04:00.000 --> 04:00.340
I have to get Abby on board
to move forward

04:00.407 --> 04:04.578
Because my life is
at stake here.

04:04.644 --> 04:06.746
All I think about is why
people are not coming

04:06.847 --> 04:09.149
to my restaurant.

04:09.216 --> 04:11.651
If something happened here where
I had to declare bankruptcy,

04:11.718 --> 04:14.521
it could very strongly
affect my day job.

04:14.588 --> 04:16.756
That's stress.

04:16.823 --> 04:18.592
We've got all these bills
to pay this week,

04:18.658 --> 04:22.662
andthat'sthe stack.
this week?

04:22.729 --> 04:26.533
I've called upon
Chef Ramsay

04:26.600 --> 04:28.702
because of his honesty
and bluntness.

04:28.768 --> 04:30.000
But he's gonna have
his work cut out for him.

04:30.000 --> 04:30.770
But he's gonna have
his work cut out for him.

04:30.837 --> 04:32.639
I guarantee.

04:40.714 --> 04:42.048
Hello.

04:42.115 --> 04:43.183
Oh, Chef Ramsay.
Welcome to Down City.
How are you?

04:43.250 --> 04:44.184
Nice to meet you.
Likewise.

04:44.251 --> 04:45.385
My pleasure.
And your first name is?

04:45.452 --> 04:46.586
Abby.
Abby, good to see you.

04:46.653 --> 04:47.954
And you're the owner?

04:48.021 --> 04:50.222
I'm the owner,
general manage, everything.

04:50.289 --> 04:52.358
My business partner isn't here.
He'll come in tonight.
Okay, great.

04:52.425 --> 04:54.160
Yeah, his name's Rico.
Right.

04:54.226 --> 04:56.395
So you're trained
classically in terms of--

04:56.495 --> 04:57.730
Absolutely not.

04:57.797 --> 04:59.064
You would not want me
to cook you anything.

04:59.131 --> 05:00.000
Oh, really? And on
a scale of one to ten,

05:00.000 --> 05:01.634
Oh, really? And on
a scale of one to ten,

05:01.700 --> 05:02.802
mark the food.
what would you say?

05:02.868 --> 05:04.270
Where are we?
It's a ten.

05:04.336 --> 05:06.138
Wow. Wow, wow, wow.

05:06.205 --> 05:07.840
Yeah.
Perfect.
I'm starving.

05:07.907 --> 05:10.075
Because the room service
next door was shocking.

05:10.142 --> 05:12.144
Wait a minute,
wait--

05:12.211 --> 05:14.847
the room service next door
was shocking?

05:14.914 --> 05:16.615
What do you mean
it was shocking?

05:16.682 --> 05:17.917
There's a little hotel next
door--a little boutique hotel.

05:17.983 --> 05:19.685
We do the room service
for that hotel.

05:19.752 --> 05:22.755
What was the problem?

05:22.822 --> 05:24.557
Honestly?
Yeah.

05:24.623 --> 05:27.293
That was embarrassing.
Why? What did you have?

05:27.393 --> 05:29.428
This pissy, grainy soup

05:29.495 --> 05:30.000
that was stone-cold.
Hold on, it gets worse.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.063
that was stone-cold.
Hold on, it gets worse.

05:31.130 --> 05:33.899
Crab cakes that were
stone-cold in the center.

05:33.966 --> 05:36.435
It was just, like,
this bowl of mush.

05:36.502 --> 05:39.004
Disgusting.
Disgusting.
Disgusting?

05:39.071 --> 05:42.107
Well, I was, like,
"Oh, damn, he went there.

05:42.174 --> 05:43.742
He just really went there."

05:43.809 --> 05:45.611
That's impossible.
That's impossible

05:45.678 --> 05:46.579
that the crab cakes are
stone-cold.

05:46.645 --> 05:48.080
Are you telling me
I'm exaggerating?

05:48.147 --> 05:50.115
I think you're one
of those customers

05:50.182 --> 05:51.851
that I would fire
immediately. yeah.

05:51.917 --> 05:53.085
You fire customers?

05:53.152 --> 05:55.721
I have.
Okay.

05:55.788 --> 05:56.755
Well, let me sit down
and eat.

05:56.822 --> 05:57.957
Can I suggest something?

05:58.023 --> 05:59.492
I don't want you
to suggest anything,

05:59.558 --> 06:00.000
because if you're now telling me
that that room service

06:00.000 --> 06:01.594
because if you're now telling me
that that room service

06:01.660 --> 06:03.496
was you at your best,
I'm  myself

06:03.562 --> 06:06.165
before I start eating,
let me tell you that.
wow. wow.

06:06.232 --> 06:07.800
Wow.

06:07.867 --> 06:09.301
I don't know what
he's talking about.

06:09.368 --> 06:11.637
Blah blah blah blah blah.

06:11.704 --> 06:13.172
Where would you like me
to sit?

06:13.239 --> 06:14.173
We're gonna go
right over here.
Thank you. Excellent.

06:14.240 --> 06:15.841
Describe the food for me.

06:15.908 --> 06:18.310
Um, comfort food.
Middle of the road.

06:18.377 --> 06:20.646
Middle of the road?

06:20.713 --> 06:22.214
When was the last time
somebody sent food back?

06:22.281 --> 06:24.583
- Today.
- Oh, you did.

06:24.650 --> 06:26.519
Wow. Wow, wow, wow.
I'm sorry.

06:26.585 --> 06:30.000
Okay, I'll look through
the menu.

06:30.000 --> 06:30.356
Okay, I'll look through
the menu.

06:30.422 --> 06:32.791
Could I suggest something, or
no, you don't want a suggestion?

06:32.858 --> 06:34.093
If you're gonna talk to me
honestly, fine.

06:34.159 --> 06:35.995
If you're gonna start,
you know, going defensive--

06:36.061 --> 06:37.196
I'm not gonna get
defensive.

06:37.263 --> 06:39.832
I'm just defending
what we do here.

06:39.899 --> 06:42.501
Now, Abby, I'm not here
to argue with you.

06:42.568 --> 06:43.903
You asked me to come here

06:43.969 --> 06:45.738
and look at this place
to help you out.

06:45.804 --> 06:47.673
Let's get one thing
clear straight away.

06:47.740 --> 06:48.974
Cut the.
Okay.

06:49.041 --> 06:50.643
If you're gonna sit there
and start  with me--

06:50.709 --> 06:52.678
I'm not sitting,
I'm standing.
I'm gonna go for your balls.

06:52.745 --> 06:54.146
Big time.
Wow.

06:54.213 --> 06:55.514
You just told me
five minutes ago

06:55.581 --> 06:56.749
that the food's
ten out of ten,

06:56.815 --> 06:58.350
the room service is perfect.

06:58.417 --> 07:00.000
Basically, I'm going to eat,
and then I'm going to leave,

07:00.000 --> 07:00.085
Basically, I'm going to eat,
and then I'm going to leave,

07:00.152 --> 07:01.854
unless you start
telling me the truth.

07:01.921 --> 07:04.123
I don't know where
you're coming from.
Let me eat the food.

07:04.189 --> 07:05.858
I absolutely think you're
full of.

07:05.925 --> 07:07.660
I've been here five minutes,

07:07.726 --> 07:10.663
and already you're in denial.
I'm not in denial.

07:10.729 --> 07:11.864
I will back up anything
my kitchen does.

07:11.964 --> 07:14.600
Fine. I'm open-minded.
Can I order the food?

07:14.667 --> 07:16.001
Absolutely.
Thank you so much.

07:16.068 --> 07:17.970
Go for it.
Appreciate it.

07:18.037 --> 07:19.605
Wow, what a welcoming.

07:19.705 --> 07:21.173
Welcome to Providence.

07:21.240 --> 07:23.142
I didn't know they did
female cage fighters.

07:23.208 --> 07:24.310
Holy crap.

07:25.945 --> 07:28.280
Boy, I can't wait
till Rico gets here.

07:28.347 --> 07:29.815
Hi, how are you?

07:29.882 --> 07:30.000
I'm grumpy. How are you?
Good, good, good.
My name is Josh.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.117
I'm grumpy. How are you?
Good, good, good.
My name is Josh.

07:32.184 --> 07:34.420
Josh.
I'll be taking care of you.
Welcome to Down City.

07:34.486 --> 07:38.390
So nice to see
that friendly face.
Thank you.

07:38.457 --> 07:40.759
Is the owner, Abby,
always that defensive?

07:40.826 --> 07:44.229
Yeah.
It's scaring me.

07:44.296 --> 07:47.600
Okay, appetizers. Calamari.
"Crispy rings

07:47.666 --> 07:49.068
with hot, sweet pepper sauce."
Yeah, I'll go for some of that.

07:49.134 --> 07:50.302
Okay.

07:50.369 --> 07:53.706
You don't spell "peppers"
like that either.

07:53.772 --> 07:55.341
No, I guess you don't.
I didn't even notice that.

07:55.407 --> 07:57.109
How long have you been here?
Three years.

07:57.176 --> 07:58.877
Three years. Okay.

07:58.944 --> 08:00.000
3-way nachos.

08:00.000 --> 08:00.346
3-way nachos.

08:00.412 --> 08:02.081
It says "It's a party
in my mouth."

08:03.282 --> 08:05.451
Yeah.

08:05.517 --> 08:06.518
Well, if it's good enough
to be put on the menu,

08:06.585 --> 08:08.153
I'm gonna try it.

08:08.220 --> 08:09.755
So I'll go for
"party in your mouth."
okay.

08:09.822 --> 08:11.590
And the award-winning
meatloaf.

08:11.657 --> 08:13.559
That's our claim to fame.
Brilliant.

08:13.626 --> 08:15.761
Thanks, Josh.
You're welcome.

08:15.861 --> 08:18.030
Please, may God--

08:18.097 --> 08:19.498
we don't die in Rhode Island.

08:19.565 --> 08:21.467
Okay, this is
Gordon Ramsay's order.

08:21.533 --> 08:23.068
Let's make
Gordon's food.

08:23.135 --> 08:25.904
I'm a good cook,
but it's not my menu.

08:25.971 --> 08:27.640
Of course I want
to do well,

08:27.706 --> 08:29.575
but I'm not sure
what Chef Ramsay's gonna think.

08:29.642 --> 08:30.000
He's, like, "Is this how you
spell 'peppers' in America?"

08:30.000 --> 08:32.177
He's, like, "Is this how you
spell 'peppers' in America?"

08:32.244 --> 08:34.279
Three Ps. 'Cause
it's p-e-p-p...
Yeah.

08:34.346 --> 08:36.448
There's three ps in that.
There is.

08:36.515 --> 08:39.018
Hi. How are you?
How are you?

08:39.084 --> 08:41.720
Nice to meet you. Jason.
Likewise. Gordon.
Good to see you.

08:41.787 --> 08:44.123
So you're...the waiter.
Head waiter. Yes.

08:44.189 --> 08:46.258
Dining room manager. Yes.
Brilliant.
And being the head waiter,

08:46.325 --> 08:47.726
how would you describe
the food here?

08:47.793 --> 08:49.161
Below par.

08:49.261 --> 08:51.830
Abby said it was a ten.

08:51.897 --> 08:54.800
So I'm in for a treat.
Yeah.

08:54.867 --> 08:56.468
Calamari.
Okay.

08:56.535 --> 08:58.704
This is the crispy
calamari.

08:58.771 --> 09:00.000
Calamari. Yes.
Ew.

09:00.000 --> 09:00.606
Calamari. Yes.
Ew.

09:00.673 --> 09:02.841
And why is it looking
so wet?

09:02.908 --> 09:05.277
It's a sauce that
they toss it in.

09:05.344 --> 09:07.846
Say that again.
You fry it...
They fry it.

09:07.913 --> 09:10.549
And then you...
Then they toss it
in sauce.

09:10.616 --> 09:12.051
It's soaking wet.

09:12.117 --> 09:15.187
All the crispy batter's
just coming off.

09:15.254 --> 09:16.855
You know, it's not everybody's
cup of tea--it's not mine.

09:16.922 --> 09:18.457
It's certainly not mine either.

09:18.524 --> 09:20.893
However, I'm optimistic.

09:23.295 --> 09:26.532
What do you think?

09:26.598 --> 09:28.033
No.

09:28.100 --> 09:30.000
I'm sorry.
I mean, look at that there.

09:30.000 --> 09:30.903
I'm sorry.
I mean, look at that there.

09:30.969 --> 09:33.072
Oh, my God.
I'm done on that one.

09:33.138 --> 09:34.073
Yeah? I'll get rid of it
for you?

09:34.139 --> 09:35.174
I don't understand it.
Thank you.

09:35.240 --> 09:36.709
You're welcome.
Wow.

09:36.775 --> 09:40.779
Soggy, chewy,
disgusting calamari. Shocking.

09:40.846 --> 09:43.148
What'd he say about it?
He spit the calamari
back out.

09:44.783 --> 09:47.119
That's hysterical.

09:47.186 --> 09:48.387
What was he bitching about?

09:48.454 --> 09:49.354
He spit it out.

09:49.455 --> 09:50.989
I'm gonna go
at his throat today.

09:54.193 --> 09:55.427
And this is the party
in your mouth.

09:55.494 --> 09:57.563
This is the party
in my mouth.
It should be.

09:57.629 --> 09:58.831
The top plate's
very hot.

09:58.897 --> 10:00.000
It looks dreadful.

10:00.000 --> 10:00.466
It looks dreadful.

10:00.532 --> 10:03.068
I think I've just
thrown up in my mouth.

10:03.135 --> 10:08.273
What a mess. Oh, boy.

10:11.543 --> 10:13.412
I take it that was one party
you didn't want to attend.

10:13.479 --> 10:14.747
It wasn't a party in my mouth.

10:14.813 --> 10:16.381
It was like a funeral
in my mouth.

10:16.448 --> 10:17.516
A funeral?
Yeah.

10:17.583 --> 10:18.984
Well, it kind of
does look

10:19.051 --> 10:21.386
like something died.

10:21.487 --> 10:23.922
What's the matter with that?
It's gross.

10:23.989 --> 10:26.358
- What?
- We're not doing too good here.

10:26.425 --> 10:29.695
I was ready to, like...
choke him.

10:29.762 --> 10:30.000
Maybe this is
the one thing he'll like.

10:30.000 --> 10:30.963
Maybe this is
the one thing he'll like.

10:31.029 --> 10:32.231
He doesn't like anything.

10:32.297 --> 10:33.298
Maybe this'll be
the one.

10:33.365 --> 10:36.201
What, the meatloaf?
Maybe this'll be it.

10:36.268 --> 10:38.470
Here you are.
That's the meatloaf.
Okay.

10:38.537 --> 10:39.538
And this is the
Award-Winning--

10:39.605 --> 10:40.672
The Award-Winning
meatloaf.

10:40.739 --> 10:43.442
I'm excited. Thank you.
You're welcome.

10:43.509 --> 10:45.511
Doesn't move on there,
does it? Whew.

10:48.147 --> 10:52.651
Wow.
That's disgusting.

10:52.718 --> 10:54.386
What do we think?
Wow.

10:54.453 --> 10:57.089
It's not even hot.
I'm sorry.

10:57.156 --> 11:00.000
It's sort of lukewarm,
solidified chunks of crap.

11:00.000 --> 11:00.526
It's sort of lukewarm,
solidified chunks of crap.

11:00.592 --> 11:03.495
That's pretty much
the norm.

11:03.562 --> 11:05.564
It must be frikkin' embarrassing
for you to serve this.

11:05.631 --> 11:07.733
It is embarrassing.

11:07.800 --> 11:09.401
I don't like
the meatloaf here at all.

11:09.468 --> 11:11.336
We set ourself up
for disappointment

11:11.403 --> 11:12.938
when we put "Award Winning"
in front of it.

11:13.005 --> 11:15.073
What was the problem
with the meatloaf?
It's disgusting.

11:15.140 --> 11:16.775
Can you be
more specific?

11:16.842 --> 11:19.878
I didn't hear what he said.
You're gonna have to ask him.

11:19.945 --> 11:21.880
Abby and Chef Ramsay are
gonna go to blows.

11:21.947 --> 11:24.116
Can I have a word
with the team?

11:24.183 --> 11:26.351
It's inevitable.
It's going to happen.

11:26.418 --> 11:28.854
So the food was shocking.

11:28.921 --> 11:30.000
Low-par, disgusting,
dated!

11:30.000 --> 11:31.790
Low-par, disgusting,
dated!

11:31.857 --> 11:34.793
So who is the head chef here?

11:34.860 --> 11:37.596
We don't really
have one, but I guess--

11:37.663 --> 11:39.031
What do you mean
you don't have a head chef?

11:39.097 --> 11:40.365
But I guess I'm
the closest thing.

11:40.432 --> 11:41.700
Closest?
What does that mean?

11:41.767 --> 11:42.968
Talk to me, Abby.

11:43.035 --> 11:46.104
That means that I fired
my other chef,

11:46.171 --> 11:48.273
and he took over,
and I didn't want

11:48.340 --> 11:50.375
to give him a title
until he proved to himself

11:50.442 --> 11:53.912
that he could handle
a kitchen.

11:53.979 --> 11:55.881
Abby, what you're employing
is a ship

11:55.948 --> 11:57.316
with no captain at the helm,

11:57.382 --> 12:00.000
and a team
desperate for guidance.

12:00.000 --> 12:00.252
and a team
desperate for guidance.

12:00.319 --> 12:02.788
No guidance is
no standards.

12:02.855 --> 12:05.557
No standards is
not consistency.

12:05.624 --> 12:07.659
So who came up
with the menu?

12:07.726 --> 12:09.494
This is American
comfort food.

12:09.561 --> 12:13.131
Somebody's dreaming here.

12:13.198 --> 12:14.700
I did. I did.

12:14.766 --> 12:16.268
I take full responsibility
for the menu.

12:16.335 --> 12:20.439
You have no cooking background,
but you put the menu together?

12:20.505 --> 12:22.808
Abby, you've for to understand
how frustrating this is.

12:22.875 --> 12:25.577
It's ridiculous!

12:25.644 --> 12:27.145
I don't know what to say.
Fix it. You fix it.

12:27.212 --> 12:28.847
That's why you're here.
Oh, come on, Abby.

12:28.914 --> 12:30.000
How can I fix it when you stand
there in front of your team

12:30.000 --> 12:31.216
How can I fix it when you stand
there in front of your team

12:31.283 --> 12:34.253
rating you and your restaurant
and your food

12:34.319 --> 12:36.521
ten out of ten?
Dreamer!

12:36.588 --> 12:39.091
I don't think it's as bad
as you say it is.

12:39.157 --> 12:40.392
Okay, stop being
in denial!

12:40.459 --> 12:42.030
Can you be more specific
about the meatloaf?

12:42.030 --> 12:43.428
What did you not like
about the meatloaf?

12:43.495 --> 12:46.499
Oh,!

12:46.565 --> 12:47.400
Can you say something
besides--

12:47.500 --> 12:48.567
You're loopy!

12:48.634 --> 12:50.169
I've been called
worse than that.

12:50.236 --> 12:52.838
Wake up and admit
it's!

12:52.905 --> 12:54.340
Bring it on.

12:54.407 --> 12:56.409
Oh, come on.
Bring it on.

12:56.475 --> 12:57.743
What do you mean,
"Bring it on"?

12:57.810 --> 13:00.000
To have Chef Ramsay say
everything you've done,

13:00.000 --> 13:01.380
To have Chef Ramsay say
everything you've done,

13:01.447 --> 13:04.383
everything that you've
dreamed of doing is...

13:04.517 --> 13:06.185
I was blown away.

13:06.252 --> 13:08.254
I need some fresh air.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.525
Coming up on
Kitchen Nightmares...

13:12.591 --> 13:14.493
- Here we go.
- The battle intensifies.

13:14.560 --> 13:15.561
You're in ,
and you can't accept it!

13:15.628 --> 13:17.363
you!

13:17.430 --> 13:19.065
Abby reaches her breaking
point...

13:19.131 --> 13:21.200
- I'm not gonna listen to you.
- But so does Chef Ramsay.

13:21.267 --> 13:23.069
You stuck up,
precious little bitch!

13:23.135 --> 13:25.237
It's a blow-up so explosive...

13:25.304 --> 13:27.440
Get the  out of my restaurant!
You want me to go?

13:27.506 --> 13:29.942
That it rivals anything chef
Ramsay has ever faced before.

13:30.009 --> 13:31.744
She's deluded,
that woman.

13:31.811 --> 13:34.480
That's coming up
on Kitchen Nightmares.

13:41.233 --> 13:43.368
After Chef Ramsay's
harsh critique...

13:43.435 --> 13:47.406
The food was shocking.
Dated and tasteless!

13:47.473 --> 13:48.841
Abby has a conversation

13:48.907 --> 13:52.377
With the one person she believes
is always right...Herself.

13:52.444 --> 13:53.812
So what do I do?

13:53.879 --> 13:55.447
Like, just get out
of the restaurant business?

13:55.514 --> 13:57.649
Then, obviously,
my 33 years in the business

13:57.716 --> 13:59.418
is, like, worthless,

13:59.485 --> 14:01.987
and I have no idea
what the  I'm doing.

14:02.054 --> 14:03.689
Okay...

14:03.755 --> 14:06.549
I think I'm going to open up
that hotdog stand on the beach.

14:06.549 --> 14:07.626
I think I'm going to open up
that hotdog stand on the beach.

14:07.693 --> 14:09.761
Want some tea
or something?

14:09.828 --> 14:10.996
No.

14:11.063 --> 14:13.665
I believe,
from the bottom of my heart,

14:13.732 --> 14:14.967
that's he's wrong.

14:15.033 --> 14:17.169
I really don't care
what he does.

14:17.236 --> 14:20.539
He's completely
full of.

14:20.606 --> 14:22.107
Like, seriously,

14:22.174 --> 14:24.776
our meatloaf is, like,
what put us on the map.

14:24.843 --> 14:26.845
I mean, it's great.

14:28.981 --> 14:31.149
I don't like the meatloaf.
You really don't?

14:31.216 --> 14:33.986
I honestly don't.
We had it
the other night together.

14:34.052 --> 14:36.388
What? What didn't
you like about it?

14:36.455 --> 14:36.549
I think our food
is mediocre.

14:36.549 --> 14:37.556
I think our food
is mediocre.

14:37.623 --> 14:39.358
Like, it's not--
Mini me, seriously!

14:39.424 --> 14:40.726
You're telling me now
you don't like it?

14:40.792 --> 14:42.327
I eat it
'cause we're here.

14:42.394 --> 14:43.662
This is not my
restaurant of choice.

14:43.729 --> 14:45.764
I will not dine here
in my off time.

14:45.831 --> 14:46.665
You're saying,
for what we serve--

14:46.732 --> 14:47.900
Comfort food, meatloaf,

14:47.966 --> 14:49.101
pasta, steak, whatever--
you're saying--

14:49.234 --> 14:51.870
No.

14:51.937 --> 14:56.041
So now you're all telling me
that you don't like the menu?

14:56.108 --> 14:58.377
I feel stabbed
in the back, I guess.

14:58.443 --> 15:00.846
You're just hitting me
with this now?

15:00.913 --> 15:02.047
You know what
we're up against

15:02.114 --> 15:04.283
if we even opened our mouth
about the menu once?

15:04.349 --> 15:05.317
Every time we opened
our mouth,

15:05.384 --> 15:06.549
"you don't know anything."

15:06.549 --> 15:06.685
"you don't know anything."

15:06.752 --> 15:09.121
We're all at a point now
where we're just, like,

15:09.221 --> 15:11.156
if this is what she wants,
let's just serve it out.

15:11.223 --> 15:13.525
We'll take it out of the window
and bring it to the table.

15:13.592 --> 15:14.693
What are we gonna have
an opinion about now?

15:14.760 --> 15:16.228
This is.
No, no, no, no.

15:16.295 --> 15:17.996
This is . No!
Talk to us.

15:18.063 --> 15:20.899
Without a doubt,
she's in denial.

15:22.801 --> 15:24.636
It's an hour before
dinner service,

15:24.703 --> 15:27.606
And Down City's other owner,
Rico, shows up...

15:27.673 --> 15:28.907
Hello.

15:28.974 --> 15:30.475
Unaware of what happened
earlier.

15:30.542 --> 15:31.977
But that's quickly about
to change.

15:32.044 --> 15:33.445
How are you?

15:33.512 --> 15:34.379
I don't even know how
to answer that.

15:36.315 --> 15:36.549
I think it's time
for Abby to find out

15:36.549 --> 15:37.749
I think it's time
for Abby to find out

15:37.816 --> 15:41.486
that the outbursts and
the treating employees badly--

15:41.553 --> 15:44.389
it is definitely time she had
someone other than myself

15:44.456 --> 15:46.758
telling her,
"You can't be doing this."

15:46.858 --> 15:48.961
Really? Wow.

15:55.367 --> 15:57.603
Make it a double.

15:57.669 --> 15:59.137
Oh...

15:59.204 --> 16:00.772
How are you?

16:00.839 --> 16:04.476
I'll get up, and
I'll go say hi.

16:04.543 --> 16:06.411
Gordon?
Good to see you.

16:06.478 --> 16:06.549
Nice to meet you.
I'm Rico.
Rico. Now,
have you got two minutes?

16:06.549 --> 16:08.513
Nice to meet you.
I'm Rico.
Rico. Now,
have you got two minutes?

16:08.580 --> 16:09.715
Sure.
We're gonna catch you up.

16:09.781 --> 16:10.749
Where should we go?
Yeah, let's go in there.

16:10.816 --> 16:12.517
He may rip me apart too,

16:12.584 --> 16:14.419
But I just want
this restaurant to work.

16:14.486 --> 16:15.954
So let's get
turning it around.

16:16.021 --> 16:19.725
What a day. Obviously,
you weren't here for lunch.

16:19.791 --> 16:22.260
Just explain what you do
during the day.

16:22.327 --> 16:23.629
I work for a credit union
during the day.

16:23.695 --> 16:24.796
I do their mortgages
for 'em.

16:24.863 --> 16:27.599
Okay. Wow.
Financing?
Yes, financing.

16:27.666 --> 16:29.234
And then you bought
a restaurant.

16:29.334 --> 16:30.802
Then I bought a restaurant.

16:30.869 --> 16:32.871
How's that worked out
for you so far?
Oh, horribly.

16:32.971 --> 16:34.239
If we had to
close this tomorrow,

16:34.306 --> 16:35.941
what are you in for?

16:36.008 --> 16:36.549
. Really?
Mm-hmm.

16:36.549 --> 16:38.644
. Really?
Mm-hmm.

16:38.710 --> 16:39.978
This is quite serious
, now.

16:40.045 --> 16:41.747
Oh, yeah.
What happens
if it fails?

16:41.813 --> 16:43.582
I could possibly lose
my day job.

16:43.649 --> 16:46.051
Really?
Because I'm in
the financial field.

16:46.118 --> 16:47.886
I'm advising people
on what to do

16:47.953 --> 16:50.389
with their mortgaging and
financing their properties

16:50.455 --> 16:52.758
and things like that.
so you're up to there.

16:54.426 --> 16:56.194
You've got a big stake
in this restaurant,

16:56.261 --> 17:01.066
and a huge amount of jeopardy
if it fails.

17:01.133 --> 17:03.535
Mm-hmm. You're right.

17:03.602 --> 17:05.137
There's a line that I walk
in here--a very fine line.

17:05.203 --> 17:06.549
I have a lot at stake.

17:06.549 --> 17:06.571
I have a lot at stake.

17:06.638 --> 17:09.107
But I totally let Abby
run the restaurant,

17:09.174 --> 17:11.510
and maybe that's a mistake
on my part.

17:13.979 --> 17:15.480
With dinner service
already underway...

17:15.547 --> 17:17.282
What about something
to drink to get you started?

17:17.349 --> 17:19.284
Chef Ramsay is eager to spend
some time in the kitchen

17:19.351 --> 17:20.519
to see how it functions.

17:20.585 --> 17:22.788
Wow, tight behind the line.

17:22.854 --> 17:24.556
So who's doing what?
Explain the line to me.

17:28.927 --> 17:30.596
, why is
the place so messy?

17:32.764 --> 17:34.800
Is the kitchen
normally this filthy?

17:34.866 --> 17:36.201
The last couple days,
it's been, uh,

17:36.268 --> 17:36.549
a lot going on.

17:36.549 --> 17:38.103
a lot going on.

17:38.170 --> 17:39.972
That is foul.

17:40.038 --> 17:41.373
With the kitchen in disarray,

17:41.440 --> 17:43.742
Chef Ramsay goes on the hunt
to find out

17:43.809 --> 17:46.178
what is lurking below.

17:46.244 --> 17:49.114
Oh, my God.

17:49.181 --> 17:51.083
Ah, this is gross
down here.

17:51.149 --> 17:52.184
Holy crap.

17:52.250 --> 17:54.086
Look at that.
Lamb bones.

17:54.152 --> 17:55.654
Just dumped in there
like that.

17:57.155 --> 17:59.558
What is that?

17:59.625 --> 18:00.759
Chicken carcasses.

18:00.826 --> 18:02.594
Oh, my God.

18:02.661 --> 18:04.496
And while Chef Ramsay
has his hands full

18:04.563 --> 18:06.198
In the walk-in...
God knows what that is.

18:06.264 --> 18:06.549
Abby has her hands full
in the dining room.

18:06.549 --> 18:08.600
Abby has her hands full
in the dining room.

18:08.667 --> 18:10.602
Abby...

18:10.669 --> 18:12.604
I need a new calamari
with the sauce on the side,

18:12.671 --> 18:14.072
'cause he says
it's too mushy.

18:14.139 --> 18:18.510
Can I have another calamari
with sauce on the side, please?

18:21.880 --> 18:24.416
Is it? Yeah, let me
take it out the way for you.

18:24.483 --> 18:26.585
I need a spin dip.
This is cold.

18:26.652 --> 18:28.286
I'm going out of my mind
right now.

18:28.353 --> 18:29.554
It's a nightmare.

18:29.621 --> 18:31.323
Can we just 86
this special?

18:31.390 --> 18:32.858
Every single one of them
has been sent back.

18:32.924 --> 18:34.059
Uh, Rico, Abby.

18:34.126 --> 18:35.127
I need one minute.

18:35.227 --> 18:36.549
Just both of you
together, one minute.

18:36.549 --> 18:36.662
Just both of you
together, one minute.

18:36.728 --> 18:37.863
Why right now?

18:37.929 --> 18:39.064
Like, are you kidding me?

18:39.164 --> 18:40.632
Have a look in there.

18:40.699 --> 18:44.036
Look at the state of what
they're cooking out of.

18:44.102 --> 18:45.337
Have you any idea

18:45.404 --> 18:46.438
what's in what box?

18:46.505 --> 18:48.073
Uh, what goes where?

18:48.140 --> 18:50.876
Over here, there
you got a little bag

18:50.942 --> 18:52.678
of chicken carcasses.

18:52.744 --> 18:54.479
On this one here,
you've got some

18:54.546 --> 18:56.648
raw chicken,
cooked pork there.

18:56.715 --> 18:59.284
This is you with 30 years
in the business.

18:59.351 --> 19:01.119
Yeah, hold on.
It gets worse.

19:01.186 --> 19:02.621
I don't know what that is.
Well...

19:02.688 --> 19:04.256
Looks like cheese
or something.

19:04.322 --> 19:06.058
But what is that there?
What is that?

19:06.124 --> 19:06.549
What, are you lost
for words?

19:06.549 --> 19:07.793
What, are you lost
for words?

19:07.859 --> 19:09.728
The place is a filthy mess.

19:09.795 --> 19:10.929
Look, what is that?

19:10.996 --> 19:12.464
Lamb bones?

19:12.531 --> 19:14.266
Who's organizing this?

19:14.332 --> 19:15.434
You haven't got
a head chef?

19:15.500 --> 19:17.169
Jimmy is my head chef.

19:17.235 --> 19:18.570
So we have a head chef.

19:18.637 --> 19:19.771
Before, you weren't ready

19:19.838 --> 19:21.973
to confirm he was
the head chef.

19:22.040 --> 19:24.376
All of a sudden, we discover
a mess down here, now...

19:24.443 --> 19:26.244
He's appointed.

19:29.381 --> 19:30.615
What happened?
What?

19:30.682 --> 19:32.384
I was talking to Rico.
It has nothing to do with you.

19:32.451 --> 19:34.453
Has nothing to do with me?
No.

19:34.519 --> 19:35.721
Excuse me, what do
you think I'm doing?

19:35.821 --> 19:36.549
I mean, I--I'm trying--

19:36.549 --> 19:37.723
I mean, I--I'm trying--

19:37.789 --> 19:39.791
You're being a.
This wasn't like this before.

19:39.858 --> 19:42.360
It wasn't like this.
Hold it,
hold on a minute!

19:42.427 --> 19:44.029
You're calling me a?

19:44.096 --> 19:45.464
I am!

19:45.530 --> 19:47.432
You stuck up,
precious little bitch!

19:47.499 --> 19:49.334
Let me tell you something!
Oh, boy.
Here we go.

19:49.401 --> 19:50.769
Listen to me.
I'm not gonna
listen to you.

19:50.836 --> 19:52.704
You're in denial!
I'm not in denial!

19:52.771 --> 19:54.239
You are. Yes, you are.
I am not in denial!

19:54.306 --> 19:56.374
- And you can't even accept it.
-  You.

19:56.441 --> 19:57.242
Go walk out then!
I am!

19:57.342 --> 19:58.410
you!

19:58.477 --> 19:59.978
There you go.
Flip the bird.

20:00.045 --> 20:01.246
That's your attitude.

20:01.313 --> 20:02.547
And that's your partner.

20:02.614 --> 20:03.949
I'm really sorry,

20:04.015 --> 20:05.617
but this wasn't like this
before I got here?

20:05.684 --> 20:06.549
She's deluded, that woman.

20:06.549 --> 20:06.685
She's deluded, that woman.

20:06.752 --> 20:08.420
You are insane!
You are, like--

20:08.487 --> 20:09.888
Yeah, brain me all you want!

20:09.955 --> 20:11.790
These excuses
that you're insane!

20:11.857 --> 20:13.191
I'm insane?
You're insane!

20:13.258 --> 20:15.193
- You've got to admit the  truth!
-  You're insane.

20:15.260 --> 20:16.361
That refrigerator
was not like that

20:16.428 --> 20:17.796
before you got here.

20:17.863 --> 20:19.898
You're in denial.
Flip out again!

20:19.965 --> 20:23.101
I would never allow that
refrigerator to look like that.

20:23.168 --> 20:24.503
The moldy lamb bones?

20:24.569 --> 20:26.004
I don't even talk
to my staff like this!

20:26.071 --> 20:27.205
Why don't you get the
out of my restaurant?

20:27.272 --> 20:28.940
Want me to go?
I would love you to go.

20:29.007 --> 20:31.009
Get the  out
of my restaurant, please!

20:31.076 --> 20:33.378
You are so in denial!
You need therapy!

20:35.213 --> 20:36.549
You're a disgrace
to this industry.

20:36.549 --> 20:36.782
You're a disgrace
to this industry.

20:36.848 --> 20:39.184
you, and get
out of my restaurant.

20:39.284 --> 20:40.219
Are you still here?

20:40.285 --> 20:41.687
Not now, guys, please?

20:41.754 --> 20:42.988
him.

20:53.521 --> 20:55.023
Right from the beginning,

20:55.089 --> 20:56.925
Chef Ramsay and Abby
have clashed.

20:56.991 --> 20:58.126
Stop being in denial!

20:58.193 --> 20:59.894
I don't think it's as bad
as you say it--

20:59.994 --> 21:01.362
Dreamer.

21:01.429 --> 21:02.363
But after a confrontation

21:02.430 --> 21:04.199
Over the state
of the walk-in...

21:04.265 --> 21:06.101
You're being a.
This wasn't like this.

21:06.167 --> 21:07.769
You're calling me
a?

21:08.938 --> 21:10.105
Abby has completely lost it.

21:10.172 --> 21:11.640
You are insane!
You are, like--

21:11.707 --> 21:13.142
Yeah, brain me
all you want!

21:13.208 --> 21:15.144
These excuses
that you're insane!

21:15.210 --> 21:16.845
I'm insane?
You're insane!

21:16.912 --> 21:18.514
And while she has had enough
of Chef Ramsay...

21:18.581 --> 21:19.582
Get the  out
of my restaurant, please.

21:19.582 --> 21:20.616
Get the  out
of my restaurant, please.

21:20.683 --> 21:23.319
You are so in denial!
You need therapy!

21:23.385 --> 21:25.020
He has had enough of her.

21:25.087 --> 21:26.422
You're a disgrace
to this industry.

21:26.488 --> 21:29.124
You, and get
out of my restaurant.

21:29.224 --> 21:30.159
Are you still here?

21:30.225 --> 21:31.694
Not now, guys, please?

21:31.760 --> 21:32.928
him.

21:42.504 --> 21:44.673
Chef Ramsay.

21:44.740 --> 21:48.310
Hey, guys, I need
some privacy, please.

21:50.512 --> 21:51.880
This is, uh, too serious.

21:51.947 --> 21:54.950
And I'm not gonna
jeopardize 25 years

21:55.017 --> 21:56.852
busting my ass off
in this industry

21:56.919 --> 21:58.954
to take that
from someone

21:59.021 --> 22:01.123
so in denial.

22:01.190 --> 22:02.224
Mm-hmm.

22:02.291 --> 22:04.026
I really don't need this.

22:04.093 --> 22:05.194
I would rather
this restaurant close

22:05.260 --> 22:06.161
than have him in here.

22:06.228 --> 22:08.764
That refrigeration unit

22:08.864 --> 22:10.199
was a mess.

22:10.265 --> 22:11.300
Mm-hmm.

22:11.367 --> 22:12.334
Behind the line
was a mess.

22:12.401 --> 22:13.502
I know.
I'm really sorry.

22:13.569 --> 22:16.105
Honestly, she's got
to start listening.

22:16.171 --> 22:17.806
I-I know, and I don't
know how to make her do it.

22:17.906 --> 22:19.582
I really...I don't know.

22:19.582 --> 22:20.075
I really...I don't know.

22:20.142 --> 22:22.244
Is he--he's coming back
tonight, isn't he?

22:22.311 --> 22:23.646
I don't give a
where he goes.

22:23.712 --> 22:26.615
He can go to hell
for all I care.

22:26.682 --> 22:28.083
If you want me to leave,

22:28.150 --> 22:29.051
I'm out of here.

22:29.151 --> 22:30.219
Absolutely not.

22:30.285 --> 22:32.454
Absolutely not.

22:32.521 --> 22:35.057
Okay, I need...
your help.

22:35.124 --> 22:37.559
You have my 100% support.

22:37.660 --> 22:39.395
100%.

22:39.461 --> 22:41.397
Okay, I'm gonna
go for a walk.

22:41.463 --> 22:42.598
I'll come back.
Okay?
Okay.

22:42.665 --> 22:43.899
Thank you.
Thank you.

22:46.969 --> 22:48.804
Abby needs to be on board
with us

22:48.871 --> 22:49.582
and stop her denial
of everything.

22:49.582 --> 22:52.307
and stop her denial
of everything.

22:52.374 --> 22:53.442
We have to break
through it.

22:55.744 --> 22:57.246
I feel pretty.

22:57.312 --> 23:00.416
How would you feel
if someone is telling you

23:00.482 --> 23:02.084
that your life's work

23:02.151 --> 23:04.386
and everything you've dreamed
of doing for your whole life,

23:04.453 --> 23:05.954
um, is?

23:06.021 --> 23:08.624
So now I'm completely
questioning myself.

23:08.691 --> 23:10.659
And I hope we can
have a conversation

23:10.726 --> 23:12.561
about what needs to be done
in this restaurant.

23:14.697 --> 23:16.198
After a volatile evening

23:16.265 --> 23:18.734
that included a massive
blowup with Chef Ramsay

23:18.801 --> 23:19.582
and a weak dinner service,

23:19.582 --> 23:20.302
and a weak dinner service,

23:20.369 --> 23:22.838
Abby has been
clearly humbled

23:22.905 --> 23:24.473
and seems ready
to finally listen

23:24.540 --> 23:26.442
to what Chef Ramsay
has to say.

23:26.508 --> 23:28.977
Okay, let's agree
on something.

23:29.044 --> 23:30.479
Today's been
a  day?

23:30.546 --> 23:32.114
Mm-hmm.
Absolutely.
Yeah?

23:32.181 --> 23:33.449
I'm not here to rub
your face in it,

23:33.515 --> 23:34.450
let's get that right.

23:34.516 --> 23:35.584
Okay.

23:35.651 --> 23:36.585
But Abby, you know,

23:36.652 --> 23:38.320
I've had failure
in my life.

23:38.387 --> 23:40.155
But one thing I'm not in

23:40.222 --> 23:41.256
is denial.

23:41.323 --> 23:42.424
And when I do
make a mistake,

23:42.491 --> 23:43.392
I admit it.

23:43.459 --> 23:44.827
I understand.

23:44.893 --> 23:46.929
So tomorrow we need
to start

23:46.995 --> 23:48.764
being honest and open

23:48.831 --> 23:49.582
so I can start rebuilding.

23:49.582 --> 23:50.265
so I can start rebuilding.

23:50.332 --> 23:52.367
I can't rebuild on B.S.

23:52.434 --> 23:53.669
I agree.

23:53.736 --> 23:55.037
I want you to be here.

23:55.104 --> 23:57.406
I want you to help me get
this restaurant to where

23:57.439 --> 23:59.141
I need it to be.

24:00.776 --> 24:02.778
Where we know
it can be.

24:02.878 --> 24:03.779
Yep.

24:03.879 --> 24:05.681
Tomorrow we start again.

24:05.748 --> 24:06.882
Get some rest.

24:11.053 --> 24:12.221
It's a new day,

24:12.321 --> 24:14.490
and Abby and Rico
are on board for change.

24:14.556 --> 24:16.024
Morning, morning, morning.

24:16.091 --> 24:17.726
But before that can happen,

24:17.793 --> 24:19.261
Chef Ramsay wants
to give the staff

24:19.328 --> 24:19.582
something they have been
rarely given:

24:19.582 --> 24:21.296
something they have been
rarely given:

24:21.363 --> 24:24.800
a chance to talk freely
without getting fired.

24:24.866 --> 24:26.034
So this is what
we're gonna do.

24:26.101 --> 24:27.402
I want each of you

24:27.469 --> 24:29.237
to write down...

24:29.304 --> 24:30.739
Some questions.

24:30.806 --> 24:34.343
And direct them
to the person you want...

24:34.409 --> 24:36.111
them to answer.

24:37.746 --> 24:40.115
This is going to be
another hell day for me.

24:40.182 --> 24:42.217
Don't sign your name.
It's anonymous.

24:42.284 --> 24:44.853
I knew that if we
were gonna do an exercise.

24:44.920 --> 24:46.888
Um, in talking
about the restaurant,

24:46.955 --> 24:49.224
I knew that it was all
gonna be directed at me.

24:49.291 --> 24:49.582
Thank you very much.

24:49.582 --> 24:51.026
Thank you very much.

24:51.126 --> 24:52.327
Okay, good.

24:52.394 --> 24:54.162
Here's the, uh,
the first one.

24:54.229 --> 24:56.665
Wow. Abby.

24:56.732 --> 24:59.568
"Why is the menu so huge?"

24:59.735 --> 25:00.669
We, uh,

25:00.769 --> 25:01.703
just, um,

25:01.803 --> 25:03.005
to give the customer
more choices.

25:03.071 --> 25:04.906
But the amount of dishes

25:04.973 --> 25:06.708
is absurd.

25:06.775 --> 25:08.076
And the more dishes,

25:08.143 --> 25:09.745
the lower the standard.

25:11.213 --> 25:12.514
Uh, Abby and Jimmy.

25:12.581 --> 25:14.349
"The quality of the food
needs to improve.

25:14.416 --> 25:15.517
How can we fix it?"

25:15.584 --> 25:17.986
Good question.

25:18.053 --> 25:19.121
And it all comes down
to menu size.

25:19.187 --> 25:19.582
With as many items
as there are,

25:19.582 --> 25:21.757
With as many items
as there are,

25:21.823 --> 25:22.991
if you prep

25:23.058 --> 25:25.794
50 items just
for dinner alone,

25:25.861 --> 25:27.162
and then the dessert menu,

25:27.229 --> 25:28.997
you can't prep
enough stuff...

25:29.064 --> 25:30.198
Yeah.

25:30.265 --> 25:31.566
It's like you--
you just can't do it.

25:31.633 --> 25:33.335
Who's putting
all those dishes on there?

25:33.402 --> 25:34.803
Abigail.
Abby.

25:34.870 --> 25:37.606
When I put
this menu together,

25:37.673 --> 25:40.175
I just expected my staff

25:40.242 --> 25:42.310
to just do this menu.

25:42.377 --> 25:43.645
Abby.

25:43.712 --> 25:45.514
"Why do you not allow

25:45.580 --> 25:47.616
"anyone to express
their opinions

25:47.683 --> 25:49.582
without it being seen
as a personal attack to you?"

25:49.582 --> 25:50.485
without it being seen
as a personal attack to you?"

25:52.854 --> 25:54.122
Since I bought
this restaurant,

25:54.222 --> 25:57.259
I became a defensive...

25:57.359 --> 25:58.493
Bitch.

25:58.560 --> 26:00.862
I question and I get upset

26:00.929 --> 26:02.798
at the fact that you're
questioning what I'm doing.

26:02.898 --> 26:04.933
That's paranoia.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.802
We do care about
this restaurant.

26:06.868 --> 26:08.203
You are our friend.

26:08.270 --> 26:10.539
So we want
to see you succeed,

26:10.605 --> 26:12.908
and the answer I've gotten
from you in the past is,

26:12.974 --> 26:14.876
"you.
That's not true."

26:14.943 --> 26:16.111
We're just here
for money.

26:16.178 --> 26:17.646
Or we're
just here because--
What?

26:17.713 --> 26:19.582
We're just here 'cause we can't
get other jobs and stuff.

26:19.582 --> 26:19.648
We're just here 'cause we can't
get other jobs and stuff.

26:19.715 --> 26:20.982
And it's--it's hurtful,

26:21.049 --> 26:22.284
because when you invest
so much time,

26:22.350 --> 26:23.952
and we would do
anything for you.

26:24.019 --> 26:25.387
And I completely realize

26:25.454 --> 26:26.855
that we've just
got to talk more

26:26.922 --> 26:27.989
instead of me yelling
and screaming.

26:28.056 --> 26:29.391
It can't just be
my show.

26:29.458 --> 26:30.926
It's not the Abby show.

26:30.992 --> 26:32.094
It's the Down City show.

26:32.160 --> 26:34.496
Are you ready
to embrace change?

26:34.563 --> 26:36.098
Yeah, absolutely.
Major change?

26:36.164 --> 26:37.566
Absolutely.

26:37.632 --> 26:39.868
I think this experience
is making Abby realize

26:39.935 --> 26:42.104
that she has
to relinquish control.

26:42.170 --> 26:44.940
And I think
she's going to do it,

26:45.006 --> 26:46.408
because I think
Abby turning around

26:46.475 --> 26:49.582
is definitely Paramount
for this restaurant to survive.

26:49.582 --> 26:49.711
is definitely Paramount
for this restaurant to survive.

26:49.778 --> 26:52.380
Coming up
on Kitchen Nightmares...

26:52.447 --> 26:54.349
Can I have some food
up in the window, please?

26:54.416 --> 26:56.218
Abby may be focused
on moving ahead...

26:56.284 --> 26:57.953
Come on, guys.

26:58.019 --> 27:00.322
But can her kitchen staff
step up their game?

27:00.388 --> 27:02.257
I'm confused on where we are
for apps.

27:02.324 --> 27:03.759
Oh, my God.

27:03.825 --> 27:05.026
Chef Ramsay tries desperately

27:05.093 --> 27:06.495
To save Down City
from going down.

27:06.561 --> 27:08.764
Quit falling behind.
You've got to work together.

27:08.830 --> 27:10.132
But this Providence restaurant

27:10.198 --> 27:12.134
could be too hopeless
to turn around.

27:12.200 --> 27:14.136
None of us know
what the  we're doing.

27:21.787 --> 27:23.456
Right, Jimmy, let's go, bud.

27:23.522 --> 27:26.259
As Abby's menu was clearly
bogging down the kitchen,

27:26.326 --> 27:27.627
Chef Ramsay has
gone through it

27:27.694 --> 27:28.962
and scaled it back.

27:29.029 --> 27:30.930
Tonight, we're just gonna
keep it really simple.

27:30.997 --> 27:32.298
For tonight's dinner service,

27:32.365 --> 27:34.234
half the items
are off the menu.

27:34.301 --> 27:36.903
And he's introducing
a roasted chicken special.

27:36.970 --> 27:39.072
Just cut the breast,
fat side down.

27:39.139 --> 27:40.106
Just cut through.

27:40.173 --> 27:41.508
Everyone's excited,

27:41.575 --> 27:42.776
and we can't have
another night

27:42.842 --> 27:43.977
like the previous few.

27:44.044 --> 27:46.079
It's time to get it right.

27:46.146 --> 27:47.314
Happy?
Happy.

27:47.380 --> 27:48.637
Makes it a lot
more simple.

27:48.637 --> 27:48.715
Makes it a lot
more simple.

27:48.782 --> 27:49.783
Big time.

27:52.385 --> 27:54.120
Folks, good evening.
Welcome to Down City.

27:54.187 --> 27:56.623
Follow me.

27:56.690 --> 27:58.825
Did you guys decide
on appetizers?

27:58.892 --> 28:00.860
We're gonna have an order
of the calamari.

28:00.927 --> 28:02.228
So we're doing
two calamaris?

28:02.295 --> 28:04.097
Uh, let's get
the grilled chicken breast.

28:04.164 --> 28:05.999
Chicken breast?
Yes.

28:06.066 --> 28:07.701
I've got to get everyone
involved

28:07.767 --> 28:09.469
if we are gonna take
Down City

28:09.536 --> 28:12.372
to the next step,
to the next level.

28:12.439 --> 28:13.440
All right, here we go.

28:13.506 --> 28:15.842
Order fire,
calamari, frisee salad,

28:15.942 --> 28:18.345
nicoise salad.

28:18.411 --> 28:18.637
Make sure everything comes up
at the same time.

28:18.637 --> 28:20.714
Make sure everything comes up
at the same time.

28:20.780 --> 28:23.516
Tonight's smaller menu
is having an immediate impact.

28:23.583 --> 28:25.318
Wipe the plates, please.

28:25.385 --> 28:26.753
Better-prepared appetizers

28:26.820 --> 28:28.221
are quickly leaving
the kitchen.

28:28.288 --> 28:29.255
That's 37.

28:29.322 --> 28:30.423
That's up.

28:30.490 --> 28:32.258
These, um, appetizers
going to 39?

28:32.359 --> 28:33.927
Can you help a run?

28:33.994 --> 28:35.295
And when you combine that

28:35.362 --> 28:37.464
with a calm and under control
Abby at the helm...

28:37.530 --> 28:38.832
Can you run this to
the next table, please?

28:38.898 --> 28:40.467
Down city's dinner service

28:40.533 --> 28:42.235
is off to a good start.

28:43.837 --> 28:46.406
Oh, yeah.

28:46.473 --> 28:48.637
Order fire. Calamari,
another frisee salad, no egg.

28:48.637 --> 28:49.909
Order fire. Calamari,
another frisee salad, no egg.

28:49.976 --> 28:51.611
Jimmy, we've got to bang
all these entrees out.

28:51.678 --> 28:52.812
I know, I know.

28:52.879 --> 28:54.114
Here, you're on apps.

28:54.180 --> 28:55.181
You're on table 28.

28:56.416 --> 28:58.084
Now I'm confused

28:58.151 --> 28:59.586
on where we are
for apps.

28:59.653 --> 29:00.887
You need table 28.

29:00.954 --> 29:02.689
I don't even have
a 36 up here.

29:02.756 --> 29:04.324
I didn't say 36.
Oh, wait.

29:04.391 --> 29:07.193
One, two, three.

29:07.260 --> 29:08.595
Come on, guys.
There's nothing coming out.

29:08.662 --> 29:11.131
Jimmy is supposed to be
the leader in the kitchen,

29:11.197 --> 29:12.132
calling out tickets.

29:12.198 --> 29:13.366
Do me a favor.

29:13.433 --> 29:15.201
Get two of the--
oh, you're doing something?

29:15.268 --> 29:17.137
And they just started
crossing paths.

29:17.203 --> 29:18.637
No one seemed to know what the
hell they were doing back there.

29:18.637 --> 29:19.172
No one seemed to know what the
hell they were doing back there.

29:19.239 --> 29:21.174
29 and 39.
Yes or no?

29:21.241 --> 29:23.443
No, I'm still
waiting on 28.

29:29.182 --> 29:30.583
It's an hour and a half
into a dinner service

29:30.650 --> 29:32.218
That started out
as promising.

29:32.285 --> 29:34.054
Can I have some food
up in the window please?

29:34.154 --> 29:35.188
No, dude, dude.

29:35.255 --> 29:37.090
This couscous is runny
and gross.

29:37.157 --> 29:39.659
But unfortunately
has declined rapidly.

29:39.726 --> 29:41.494
They're not even here.
That's all the way down there.

29:41.594 --> 29:42.662
They have none of this.

29:42.729 --> 29:43.997
And, not surprisingly,

29:44.064 --> 29:46.299
Diners are losing their
patience.

29:50.170 --> 29:52.305
Can I get something
up on the line, please?

29:52.372 --> 29:54.207
Yeah, right now.
Right now.

29:54.274 --> 29:55.909
Jimmy's doing
all three sections.

29:55.975 --> 29:57.177
He's covering the grill.
He's covering the salmon,

29:57.210 --> 29:58.511
he's covering the chicken.

29:58.578 --> 29:59.879
He's trying to run the kitchen
as well at the same time.

29:59.946 --> 30:01.047
He's got nothing
behind him.

30:01.114 --> 30:03.349
Oh, my God,
what a  show.

30:03.450 --> 30:06.052
Well, we've been here since
6:30, and it's already 25 of,

30:06.119 --> 30:08.021
and we still don't
have our entrees.

30:08.088 --> 30:10.557
I know, I'm gonna
go check on your entrees.
So this is not good.

30:10.623 --> 30:12.859
I've got people that had
put their orders in

30:12.926 --> 30:15.562
An hour and 15,
hour and a half, some of them.

30:15.628 --> 30:17.130
Where the
was that food?

30:17.197 --> 30:18.637
Let's, uh,
find our server

30:18.637 --> 30:18.832
Let's, uh,
find our server

30:18.932 --> 30:20.433
and--and let's just go.

30:20.500 --> 30:21.668
Did that
refired chicken go?

30:21.735 --> 30:22.869
It's right here.
Give it to him.

30:22.936 --> 30:24.637
I need it right now.
Please.

30:24.704 --> 30:25.939
Come on, is it your
first time at the rodeo?

30:26.005 --> 30:27.140
Plate 'em!

30:27.207 --> 30:29.476
Guys, they got food
dying in the window!

30:29.542 --> 30:30.410
Chris, please!

30:30.510 --> 30:32.245
Yeah, I can't take this.

30:32.312 --> 30:33.847
It was a disgrace.
It was horrifying.

30:33.913 --> 30:35.014
It was embarrassing.

30:35.081 --> 30:37.117
Don't make this.
They just walked.

30:37.183 --> 30:38.551
Oh, my God.

30:42.121 --> 30:43.489
Jimmy doesn't have
any excuses anymore.

30:43.556 --> 30:47.026
His excuse for months
has been our menu is too big.

30:47.093 --> 30:48.637
So we give him
a smaller menu to do,

30:48.637 --> 30:48.928
So we give him
a smaller menu to do,

30:48.995 --> 30:50.430
and they still can't
turn it out.

30:50.496 --> 30:52.665
So, I mean,
where do we go from here?

30:52.732 --> 30:55.301
I need one chicken
up in the line right now.

30:55.368 --> 30:57.236
With Abby pushing
her kitchen staff...

30:57.303 --> 31:00.106
I'm not taking this out
until it's all up on the line.

31:00.173 --> 31:01.174
Can I have a chicken
on the line, please?

31:01.240 --> 31:02.775
In my hands!
Okay!

31:02.842 --> 31:03.743
They still struggle.

31:03.810 --> 31:05.311
Food!
Thank you.

31:05.378 --> 31:06.846
But manage to get
the last entrees out.

31:06.913 --> 31:08.615
Ohh!
There we go!

31:08.681 --> 31:09.749
And that's the--
that's everything?

31:09.816 --> 31:11.784
Start cleaning up.

31:11.851 --> 31:13.286
Good night.
Thank you.

31:13.353 --> 31:14.520
Good night.
Thank you.

31:14.587 --> 31:17.357
Now an unusually calm Abby...

31:17.423 --> 31:18.558
Jimmy.
Come out here.

31:18.658 --> 31:19.859
Listen to me.

31:19.926 --> 31:21.327
Is about to let loose.

31:21.394 --> 31:24.230
What I saw tonight
was the worst  show

31:24.297 --> 31:26.099
I've ever seen--
ever, ever, ever seen!

31:26.199 --> 31:28.067
No, I know, I know, I know.

31:28.134 --> 31:30.036
It did not go smoothly,
but they--they--they--

31:30.136 --> 31:31.137
"Smoothly"?

31:31.204 --> 31:33.139
Jimmy, we were
an hour in

31:33.206 --> 31:36.609
before more than
two dinners went out.

31:36.676 --> 31:38.511
An hour into service.

31:38.578 --> 31:39.912
I'm almost accepting that

31:39.979 --> 31:41.648
none of us know what
the  we're doing.

31:41.714 --> 31:43.416
And we can't get
to the next step.

31:43.483 --> 31:45.084
I'm actually
considering that.

31:45.151 --> 31:47.220
After tonight,
I don't know

31:47.286 --> 31:48.637
if I have the staff
to get it back.

31:48.637 --> 31:49.455
if I have the staff
to get it back.

31:49.522 --> 31:50.556
I don't know
if we can do it.

31:58.174 --> 31:59.275
Tonight's dinner service

31:59.375 --> 32:01.477
Was plagued by confusion
and incompetence in the kitchen.

32:01.544 --> 32:03.579
Can I get something
up on the line, please?

32:03.646 --> 32:04.881
I'm confused
on where we are.

32:04.947 --> 32:06.783
Come on, is it your first
time at the rodeo?

32:06.849 --> 32:08.384
Plate 'em!

32:08.451 --> 32:10.386
The problems are obvious
to Chef Ramsay,

32:10.453 --> 32:11.654
But it's time
to find out

32:11.721 --> 32:14.424
if Abby is still
in denial.

32:14.490 --> 32:16.025
Abby, what did
you see tonight?

32:16.092 --> 32:18.227
What happened is
it happens all the time.

32:18.294 --> 32:20.396
As soon as the line
gets hit

32:20.463 --> 32:21.731
with a number of slips
at one time,

32:21.798 --> 32:24.634
the kitchen folds,
it goes down in flames.

32:24.701 --> 32:25.747
And, um...

32:25.747 --> 32:26.536
And, um...

32:26.602 --> 32:29.472
I've lost confidence
in my kitchen, um, honestly.

32:30.573 --> 32:31.908
Jimmy...

32:31.974 --> 32:33.743
I'm not blaming you
entirely.

32:33.810 --> 32:35.845
I'm looking at the tools
you've got to work with.

32:35.912 --> 32:37.246
And it's a disaster.

32:37.313 --> 32:40.550
Behind that line,
there's no way on Earth...

32:40.616 --> 32:41.884
This group of cooks

32:41.951 --> 32:45.021
can pull off a new menu.

32:45.088 --> 32:48.091
So seeing how frustrating
it's been here,

32:48.191 --> 32:49.692
I made a call

32:49.759 --> 32:53.262
to a very experienced
chef in my team

32:53.329 --> 32:55.465
to be here
first thing tomorrow morning

32:55.531 --> 32:55.747
getting your crew

32:55.747 --> 32:56.999
getting your crew

32:57.066 --> 32:58.067
at a respectable level.

32:58.167 --> 32:59.969
It's cool having his chef

33:00.036 --> 33:01.270
to help us all out.

33:01.337 --> 33:03.706
And it's gonna be a good
experience for all of us.

33:03.773 --> 33:05.241
Tomorrow's comeback day.

33:05.308 --> 33:06.309
We're relaunching...

33:06.409 --> 33:07.577
With a new menu.

33:07.643 --> 33:08.711
Let's roll up our sleeves

33:08.778 --> 33:09.712
and push it.

33:09.779 --> 33:10.913
I mean, really push it.

33:10.980 --> 33:12.181
Definitely.
Can't wait.

33:12.248 --> 33:13.516
I'll see you first thing
in the morning.

33:13.583 --> 33:14.884
Absolutely.
Thank you.

33:14.984 --> 33:16.486
Good night.

33:16.552 --> 33:18.488
I'm glad that the kitchen's
gonna be shown

33:18.554 --> 33:20.623
what to do and how
to do it properly.

33:20.690 --> 33:22.425
Because this is it.

33:22.492 --> 33:23.793
It's not only
my kitchen's last chance.

33:23.860 --> 33:25.128
It's my restaurant's
last chance.

33:30.967 --> 33:32.502
Good morning!

33:32.568 --> 33:33.569
Good morning.
Wow, come in.

33:33.636 --> 33:35.705
- How are we?
- Good.

33:35.772 --> 33:36.939
The chef that I brought in,

33:37.006 --> 33:38.274
James,

33:38.341 --> 33:40.143
has been here since
6:00 this morning,

33:40.209 --> 33:42.779
supervising,
working his ass off

33:42.845 --> 33:45.515
with your team,
getting ready for this menu.

33:45.581 --> 33:46.949
Today, your menu

33:47.016 --> 33:49.252
will be in keeping with
your beautiful restaurant

33:49.318 --> 33:50.520
and your great service.

33:50.620 --> 33:52.989
First up, the appetizers.

33:53.055 --> 33:54.190
Come down.

33:54.257 --> 33:55.324
Now, these are appetizers.

33:55.391 --> 33:55.747
Pleasing on the eye
and fun.

33:55.747 --> 33:56.893
Pleasing on the eye
and fun.

33:56.959 --> 33:58.428
Goat cheese truffle dip.

33:58.494 --> 34:00.163
Honey-spice chicken wings.

34:00.229 --> 34:02.265
Meatball sliders.
Delicious.

34:02.331 --> 34:03.533
Wow.

34:03.599 --> 34:05.001
Now we can have a real party
in our mouth, Abby.

34:06.836 --> 34:07.837
Can't wait!

34:07.904 --> 34:10.039
Okay! On to the entrees.

34:10.106 --> 34:12.341
The main event,
seared lamb chop.

34:12.408 --> 34:13.276
Classic.

34:13.342 --> 34:14.877
Lobster mac and cheese.

34:14.944 --> 34:17.113
Bacon-wrapped Angus meatloaf.

34:18.981 --> 34:20.416
Thank you.

34:20.483 --> 34:21.784
I want you to get familiar
with the new menu.

34:21.851 --> 34:23.853
Yes? Get up to speed

34:23.920 --> 34:25.747
with those dishes,
have a little taste!

34:25.747 --> 34:25.755
with those dishes,
have a little taste!

34:25.822 --> 34:27.323
This is awesome.

34:27.390 --> 34:29.091
That's money.

34:29.158 --> 34:31.227
The new menu
is beyond belief.

34:31.294 --> 34:33.095
Kind of surprised that it
came out of my kitchen.

34:34.263 --> 34:36.532
Oh, my God, that is good.

34:36.599 --> 34:38.334
Bacon-wrapped meatloaf.

34:38.401 --> 34:39.368
Isn't that awesome?

34:39.435 --> 34:43.105
Oh, my God.
It's unbelievable.

34:43.172 --> 34:46.476
I had no idea that it
could get this good.

34:46.542 --> 34:48.211
Oh, my God.
That's amazing.
Wow.

34:48.277 --> 34:50.313
I've been for years
describing this restaurant

34:50.379 --> 34:51.681
as creative comfort food.

34:51.747 --> 34:53.583
I had no clue.

34:53.649 --> 34:54.984
This is creative comfort food.

35:04.827 --> 35:06.629
I've never seen Abby
this emotional.

35:06.696 --> 35:08.631
Like, she does have
a heart in there.

35:08.698 --> 35:09.799
She does have a soul.

35:09.866 --> 35:11.734
It's amazing.

35:11.801 --> 35:13.803
There is a God.

35:15.671 --> 35:16.639
Yep.

35:20.209 --> 35:22.078
It's relaunch night
at Down City.

35:22.144 --> 35:24.480
And while Abby and Rico get
the front of the house

35:24.547 --> 35:25.747
ready for the most
important night

35:25.747 --> 35:26.382
ready for the most
important night

35:26.449 --> 35:27.583
in the restaurant's history...

35:27.650 --> 35:29.285
We are gonna rock

35:29.352 --> 35:30.353
this town tonight.

35:30.419 --> 35:31.454
Let's go, let's go.
Whoo!

35:31.521 --> 35:32.488
Back in the kitchen...

35:32.555 --> 35:33.656
Then we're gonna go here,

35:33.723 --> 35:36.659
table by table until
we have to do pits, yes?

35:36.726 --> 35:38.928
Chef James is doing the same
with the kitchen staff.

35:38.995 --> 35:40.530
Every dish perfect,
every time.

35:40.596 --> 35:41.664
Folks, how we doing
tonight?

35:41.731 --> 35:43.666
Welcome, welcome.

35:43.733 --> 35:45.635
Have you had a chance
to look at all the new and fun,

35:45.701 --> 35:47.236
exciting menu items
that we have?

35:47.303 --> 35:48.671
Let's go, guys, yeah?
I wanna hear you tonight,

35:48.738 --> 35:49.805
and I wanna
hear you too, yes?

35:49.872 --> 35:51.073
Let's go.

35:51.140 --> 35:52.542
Only minutes into the service,

35:52.608 --> 35:55.044
A locally-renowned
food blogger has arrived.

35:55.111 --> 35:55.747
Stacey Place ripped apart
her last meal in the restaurant.

35:55.747 --> 35:58.414
Stacey Place ripped apart
her last meal in the restaurant.

35:58.481 --> 36:00.349
Abby...you recognize her?

36:00.416 --> 36:02.184
Yeah.
You know how
important she is.

36:02.251 --> 36:05.254
But Chef Ramsay convinced her
to give it another try.

36:05.321 --> 36:06.923
She has 10,000 followers.

36:06.989 --> 36:09.892
She blogs tomorrow,
we're 10,000

36:09.959 --> 36:11.627
potential customers
back up.

36:11.694 --> 36:13.763
I tried everything
on this menu today.

36:13.829 --> 36:15.431
So if you have any questions,
you feel free to ask.

36:17.567 --> 36:19.101
Oh, yeah, definitely.
The goat cheese truffle dip

36:19.168 --> 36:20.236
really stood out
for me.

36:20.303 --> 36:22.071
Well, that sounds
really good.

36:22.138 --> 36:23.706
Jimmy, you and I,

36:23.773 --> 36:25.074
we're gonna be
communicating all night.

36:25.141 --> 36:25.747
I need the app for 37,
17, and 35.

36:25.747 --> 36:28.210
I need the app for 37,
17, and 35.

36:28.277 --> 36:30.379
All right.
Right now, in the window,

36:30.446 --> 36:32.582
I need that fish and chip.
I need that slider.

36:32.648 --> 36:33.816
Sliders up, Chef.

36:33.883 --> 36:35.351
A reinvigorated Jimmy

36:35.418 --> 36:37.386
Has the kitchen moving in
the right direction.

36:37.453 --> 36:38.421
Calamari.

36:38.487 --> 36:39.422
Sliders.

36:39.488 --> 36:40.456
Jimmy, keep it going, yeah?

36:40.523 --> 36:42.858
Frisee salad
on the fly!

36:42.925 --> 36:44.460
And the new menu
is being embraced

36:44.493 --> 36:45.528
By the customers.

36:46.529 --> 36:47.797
Wow.

36:47.863 --> 36:49.231
But just when it appears

36:49.298 --> 36:50.733
as though it's gonna
be smooth sailing...

36:50.800 --> 36:53.736
I need a chowder,
a calamari, a slider!

36:53.803 --> 36:55.747
Jimmy, did you call
the calamari for table 30?

36:55.747 --> 36:55.871
Jimmy, did you call
the calamari for table 30?

36:55.938 --> 36:57.006
I just did!

36:57.073 --> 36:58.174
Abby and Jimmy...

36:58.240 --> 36:59.675
Listen to me.

36:59.742 --> 37:01.110
Are having a communication
breakdown.

37:01.176 --> 37:04.146
I need four soups and one
chowder up in the line, please.

37:04.213 --> 37:05.180
That's incorrect.

37:05.247 --> 37:06.715
Uh-oh, here we go again.

37:06.782 --> 37:07.917
The repeat of last night.

37:07.983 --> 37:09.518
The kitchen's going down.

37:09.618 --> 37:10.619
We're.

37:10.686 --> 37:13.222
Jimmy, focus on 37, yeah?

37:13.289 --> 37:14.323
This is the golden ticket.

37:15.658 --> 37:16.792
This is it!

37:16.859 --> 37:19.428
All right, lead ticket,
I need a truffle dip.

37:19.495 --> 37:21.363
Truffle dip takes
six minutes, yes?

37:21.430 --> 37:22.665
Yes, sir.
All right,
get it in the oven.

37:22.731 --> 37:24.767
Jimmy, look at me.
We're falling behind!

37:24.833 --> 37:25.747
You've got to work together!

37:25.747 --> 37:25.868
You've got to work together!

37:28.804 --> 37:30.306
Come on, guys,
there's nothing coming out.

37:30.406 --> 37:31.607
Please!

37:31.674 --> 37:33.208
Let's get this food out.

37:33.275 --> 37:35.044
Give me a time on
the truffle dip, please.

37:36.245 --> 37:37.713
She's not blogging
now, is she?

37:37.780 --> 37:39.281
What's she doing?

37:39.348 --> 37:40.482
She's definitely blogging.

37:40.549 --> 37:42.318
She's blogging live
from the table?

37:42.384 --> 37:44.887
We've got bloggers
live from their table, guys.

37:44.954 --> 37:46.922
I need a truffle dip
up on the line, right now!

37:46.989 --> 37:47.923
Urgently, please!

37:47.990 --> 37:49.959
I was...horrified.

37:50.025 --> 37:51.727
We are slipping
like the night before.

37:51.794 --> 37:53.295
They're blogging as we speak.

37:53.362 --> 37:55.747
I wanted to, like,
just scream.

37:55.747 --> 37:56.131
I wanted to, like,
just scream.

37:56.198 --> 37:58.167
Come on, guys,
I need some food on the line.

37:58.233 --> 37:59.902
There's nothing in the window.
Come on, guys!

37:59.969 --> 38:01.770
I need to see some food
up on this line!

38:01.837 --> 38:03.072
It's taking too long.

38:03.138 --> 38:05.574
Literally, my kitchen
going down in flames.

38:05.641 --> 38:06.508
Listen, Jimmy...

38:06.575 --> 38:08.510
One minute, Abigail!

38:08.577 --> 38:10.145
And there was literally
nothing I could do about it.

38:10.212 --> 38:11.714
Abby, come on.

38:11.780 --> 38:12.648
Jimmy, I need
a truffle dip.

38:12.715 --> 38:14.316
Come on, guys!

38:22.769 --> 38:24.771
It's 45 minutes
into dinner service.

38:24.838 --> 38:26.073
Let's get this food out!

38:26.139 --> 38:28.842
We've got bloggers
live from their table, guys!

38:28.909 --> 38:30.510
And an influential
food blogger

38:30.577 --> 38:33.413
Who can greatly affect
the future of Down City...

38:33.480 --> 38:35.015
I need a truffle dip up on
the line, right now!

38:35.082 --> 38:38.085
Still has not received
her appetizers.

38:38.151 --> 38:39.086
Abby, two seconds,
quickly.

38:39.186 --> 38:40.087
Take over.
Take over.

38:40.187 --> 38:41.388
Let's go, Abby.

38:44.157 --> 38:45.993
She just tweeted,
"Waiting for appetizers.

38:46.059 --> 38:47.027
Getting hungry."

38:47.094 --> 38:49.162
Okay, this is not
now.

38:49.229 --> 38:49.831
Menu's there,
chefs are there.

38:49.831 --> 38:50.731
Menu's there,
chefs are there.

38:50.797 --> 38:51.898
I need you there.

38:51.965 --> 38:53.300
Control it.
Yeah?

38:53.367 --> 38:54.701
I know what you're
capable of.

38:54.768 --> 38:55.836
Yeah.
Yes? And it's
been tough

38:55.902 --> 38:57.537
for the last couple
of days, granted.

38:57.604 --> 38:59.773
However, gotta
find your voice.

38:59.840 --> 39:00.741
Okay.
All right.
Come on!

39:00.807 --> 39:01.708
Please?
Okay, let's go.

39:01.775 --> 39:02.943
Please.

39:03.010 --> 39:04.211
It's definitely time
to step it up.

39:04.277 --> 39:05.445
We want everything to go right
with that table.

39:05.512 --> 39:06.546
And we're gonna
get the job done.

39:06.613 --> 39:07.614
Listen, Jimmy,

39:07.681 --> 39:09.016
they're already blogging

39:09.082 --> 39:10.283
that they're waiting
too long for food.

39:10.384 --> 39:12.085
Let's get this food out.

39:12.152 --> 39:14.755
All right, how long
on a solo truffle there?

39:14.821 --> 39:16.089
Urgently, please!

39:16.223 --> 39:17.257
Truffle dip behind you!

39:17.324 --> 39:18.258
Thank you.

39:18.325 --> 39:19.426
Truffle dip and the salads.

39:19.493 --> 39:19.831
Caesars, they are?

39:19.831 --> 39:20.661
Caesars, they are?

39:20.727 --> 39:23.397
With that Caesar I need
sliders and a truffle dip.

39:23.463 --> 39:25.666
Come on, guys.

39:25.732 --> 39:27.501
Abby?

39:32.639 --> 39:35.275
Abby, read that
discreetly.

39:35.342 --> 39:36.977
"Truffle dip amazing."
Yes?

39:37.044 --> 39:38.645
Yeah.
Come on.
Keep it going, yes?

39:38.712 --> 39:41.982
Entrees, make sure
they come together, okay?

39:42.049 --> 39:43.150
Fire that table,
please, yeah?

39:43.216 --> 39:44.618
Jimmy! Table 37.

39:44.685 --> 39:46.219
Did you fire?
I did fire.

39:46.286 --> 39:47.120
Good.

39:47.187 --> 39:48.221
So we got everything.

39:50.457 --> 39:52.693
With Abby focused
on the task at hand...

39:52.759 --> 39:55.095
Come on!
Let's get loud back there.

39:55.162 --> 39:57.264
And Jimmy in full control
of his kitchen...

39:57.330 --> 39:59.599
You guys can fire
that fish and chip.

39:59.666 --> 40:02.402
Quality entrees are quickly
heading out to the dining room.

40:02.469 --> 40:05.839
Med-rare lamb chops.
Salmon, ribs, filet.

40:05.906 --> 40:06.840
Med-rare lamb. Heard.

40:08.542 --> 40:10.477
The food looks amazing.

40:10.544 --> 40:12.479
The food looks outstanding.
Absolutely amazing.

40:12.546 --> 40:15.015
It appears as though
blogger Stacey Place

40:15.082 --> 40:16.083
has reached her verdict.

40:18.952 --> 40:19.831
Yeah?

40:19.831 --> 40:20.420
Yeah?

40:23.457 --> 40:24.958
And she's not the only one.

40:25.058 --> 40:26.093
Do you like that?

40:26.193 --> 40:28.161
And those chips,
aren't they delicious?

40:28.228 --> 40:29.730
A lot better than
last night, right?

40:29.796 --> 40:31.598
- Yeah, definitely.
- How was everything?

40:31.665 --> 40:34.134
Delicious.
The flavor was right there.

40:34.201 --> 40:35.402
Everything was great.

40:35.469 --> 40:37.237
Great. Thank you
so much for coming in.

40:37.304 --> 40:38.472
And we're gonna
see you again.

40:38.538 --> 40:41.975
I was living an absolute
kitchen nightmare.

40:42.042 --> 40:44.811
And my dream just came true,
and I'm in absolute shock.

40:44.878 --> 40:46.913
Like, this is the restaurant
I've always wanted.

40:46.980 --> 40:48.548
Those are your
last two desserts.

40:48.615 --> 40:49.783
Jimmy...

40:49.850 --> 40:52.052
It was awesome.
Thank you.

40:52.119 --> 40:53.320
It's a new Down City.

40:53.386 --> 40:55.522
I'm just absolutely
loving it.

40:59.459 --> 41:00.393
Right.

41:00.494 --> 41:01.795
Last night,

41:01.862 --> 41:03.597
I said Down City

41:03.663 --> 41:05.532
needed to make
a comeback tonight.

41:05.632 --> 41:06.867
We did just that.

41:06.933 --> 41:08.802
Well done.

41:08.869 --> 41:10.237
Each and every one of you

41:10.303 --> 41:11.938
pulled off

41:12.005 --> 41:13.240
a great service.

41:13.306 --> 41:15.876
Customers loved the food.

41:15.942 --> 41:18.211
Abby, how do you feel,
babe?

41:18.278 --> 41:19.831
I feel beyond belief,
fantastic.

41:19.831 --> 41:22.082
I feel beyond belief,
fantastic.

41:22.149 --> 41:23.150
Looking back at it now,

41:23.216 --> 41:25.185
I was so unprofessional.

41:25.252 --> 41:26.987
Why don't you get the
out of my restaurant?

41:27.053 --> 41:29.189
- Want me to go?
-  Get the  out of my restaurant, please!

41:29.256 --> 41:31.958
The new Abby
is professional.

41:32.025 --> 41:34.494
I just want
to continue learning.

41:34.561 --> 41:36.797
It's just made me
such a better leader.

41:36.863 --> 41:38.031
Come on then.

41:38.098 --> 41:39.566
Give me a hug.

41:39.633 --> 41:41.301
You're not gonna ask me,
I'm gonna ask you.

41:41.368 --> 41:42.803
That's right.
I, Gordon Ramsay,

41:42.869 --> 41:44.004
are asking you for a hug.

41:44.070 --> 41:45.238
Come here.

41:45.305 --> 41:46.706
Huh?

41:46.773 --> 41:48.909
I absolutely love
Chef Ramsay, and, uh,

41:48.975 --> 41:49.831
I'm gonna miss him
when he goes.

41:49.831 --> 41:50.677
I'm gonna miss him
when he goes.

41:50.744 --> 41:52.012
Thank you very much,
Gordon.
Not at all.

41:52.078 --> 41:53.880
This restaurant is getting
back on the map

41:53.947 --> 41:55.282
that it hasn't
been on in a while.

41:55.348 --> 41:57.317
And I know it's only
going to get better.

41:57.384 --> 41:58.385
Good night.

41:58.451 --> 41:59.252
Thanks, chef.

41:59.319 --> 42:00.554
Thank you.

42:02.222 --> 42:04.591
Whew, without question
the biggest transformation

42:04.658 --> 42:06.193
this week is Abby,

42:06.259 --> 42:07.594
which I never expected.

42:07.661 --> 42:09.763
As Abby goes,
so goes Down City.

42:09.830 --> 42:11.198
If she can keep her cool,

42:11.264 --> 42:15.468
this restaurant's
gonna be a huge success.

42:15.569 --> 42:17.370
Wow...party in my mouth?

42:17.470 --> 42:19.506
Please.

42:19.606 --> 42:19.831
Whoo!!

42:19.831 --> 42:21.741
Whoo!!

42:23.977 --> 42:25.712
After Chef Ramsay left,

42:25.879 --> 42:27.414
Chef James stayed on

42:27.480 --> 42:29.082
and continued
to train the cooks.

42:29.149 --> 42:30.584
It gets prepped
and put away.

42:30.650 --> 42:32.319
Allowing Jimmy
the chance to thrive.

42:32.385 --> 42:33.787
All right,
the meatloaf's being plated.

42:33.854 --> 42:35.388
That settles the lead.

42:35.455 --> 42:37.924
And Abby rewarded him
with a promotion.

42:37.991 --> 42:40.760
I wanted to introduce
to all of you

42:40.827 --> 42:43.029
our head chef,
James Bjurman.

42:43.096 --> 42:44.898
Let's give itup.
Thank you.

42:44.965 --> 42:46.233
Eager to spread the word

42:46.299 --> 42:47.467
About their
upgraded restaurant...

42:47.567 --> 42:48.635
Nice to meet you.

42:48.702 --> 42:49.831
Abby and Rico hit the town.

42:49.831 --> 42:50.270
Abby and Rico hit the town.

42:50.337 --> 42:52.839
This is a crispy pork belly
in a lettuce cup.

42:52.906 --> 42:54.674
Doing some grassroots marketing

42:54.741 --> 42:57.144
by giving out samples
of their new menu.

42:57.210 --> 42:59.079
It's right down the street.
It's walking distance.

42:59.146 --> 43:01.782
Chef Ramsay saved my restaurant.
He really did.

43:01.848 --> 43:03.250
But I've got to continue it.

43:03.316 --> 43:06.153
I promise him that
the next time he comes back,

43:06.219 --> 43:08.384
the food will be a ten.
