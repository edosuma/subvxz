WEBVTT

00:03.500 --> 00:06.410
Just so you know, I had the
chicken tacos last night,

00:06.480 --> 00:09.550
and my stomach's doing somersaults.

00:09.650 --> 00:10.650
Uh...

00:10.680 --> 00:13.180
But our specials look good.

00:13.250 --> 00:14.920
We have tilapia,

00:14.950 --> 00:18.320
which is some kind of a
greasy white fish...

00:19.890 --> 00:22.560
... floating in cheese.

00:22.630 --> 00:24.940
Please don't make me
carry that out here.

00:26.730 --> 00:29.180
Now that you mention it,
that's exactly what I want.

00:30.270 --> 00:32.000
I'm gonna go exotic tonight, Beck.

00:32.070 --> 00:33.250
I'll have the pupusas.

00:33.270 --> 00:36.520
Take me away to El Salvador.

00:36.640 --> 00:37.910
Look, that's fried,

00:37.980 --> 00:40.410
and that's covered in some
kind of chunky sauce.

00:40.420 --> 00:42.280
I can't do that right now.

00:42.300 --> 00:44.010
Oh, um...

00:44.050 --> 00:45.700
You go first, Neil. I'm still looking.

00:45.740 --> 00:48.650
Okay. Uh, I would love
the three shrimp tacos.

00:48.750 --> 00:49.820
Pick something else.

00:49.850 --> 00:52.550
A lot of shrimp is peeled by Thai kids

00:52.560 --> 00:53.730
forced into slave labor,

00:53.740 --> 00:54.979
so you think you're eating scampi,

00:54.980 --> 00:56.500
but really you're exploiting children.

00:57.640 --> 01:00.459
I got an idea. What if I just
had one small shrimp taco,

01:00.460 --> 01:02.320
and I feel bad about it?

01:03.400 --> 01:04.720
Have the chile relleno.

01:04.739 --> 01:06.400
They're really good here. They're vegan.

01:06.470 --> 01:08.710
Yeah, I don't really like those.

01:08.810 --> 01:10.170
No, you will.

01:11.320 --> 01:13.010
Could you guys hurry up?

01:13.080 --> 01:15.780
I'm riding out this wave here.

01:15.850 --> 01:17.450
I'll have a shrimp burrito,

01:17.520 --> 01:20.150
and I'll have Neil's shrimp tacos.

01:20.220 --> 01:24.000
I don't know if it's those
Thai kids' sweat or tears,

01:24.020 --> 01:26.100
but they're delicious.

01:30.760 --> 01:33.680
Hey. I'm not buying this
food poisoning thing.

01:33.700 --> 01:34.930
I think you're hung over.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.670
I'm not hung over.

01:36.770 --> 01:38.000
Hold on.

01:38.070 --> 01:40.900
You're gonna have to eat
this way down there.

01:43.640 --> 01:45.780
You and I are going
to a meeting tonight.

01:47.210 --> 01:48.940
So, Neil, what do you do for a living?

01:48.960 --> 01:50.310
Uh, I'm a preschool teacher.

01:50.420 --> 01:51.610
Preschool, huh?

01:51.720 --> 01:53.630
What's that, like, playing
with blocks and stuff?

01:53.650 --> 01:55.549
Blocks and stuff?

01:55.550 --> 01:58.350
Dan, they are so far beyond that now.

01:58.460 --> 02:00.960
Oh, no, actually, no, blocks
are a big part of it.

02:01.330 --> 02:03.790
Oh, well, the old ways
are still the best ways.

02:05.160 --> 02:07.540
We try to inspire the
children's imagination

02:07.550 --> 02:11.340
with nonspecific, gender-neutral,
tactile objects.

02:11.720 --> 02:14.500
Why would you do that when there's TV?

02:17.260 --> 02:19.810
Excuse me. I just gotta go tinkle.

02:19.850 --> 02:21.260
Sorry. It's a work term.

02:25.020 --> 02:26.340
- He's great, right?
- Yeah.

02:26.360 --> 02:28.050
Does he remind you of anybody?

02:30.220 --> 02:31.860
Not really. Here's a clue,

02:31.880 --> 02:33.490
because I want you to figure it out.

02:33.500 --> 02:35.360
David!

02:37.620 --> 02:38.680
What?

02:40.100 --> 02:41.799
No... No way.

02:41.800 --> 02:43.570
Two entirely different people.

02:43.600 --> 02:45.560
Wait, wait. That wasn't David?

02:45.570 --> 02:47.100
No!

02:47.120 --> 02:48.770
She's controlling Neil

02:48.800 --> 02:52.040
the same way she controlled David.

02:52.050 --> 02:54.480
He has the same jumpy,
scared eyes as David.

02:54.500 --> 02:55.950
Are you sure that wasn't David?

02:58.220 --> 02:59.660
Hey, sorry we're late.

02:59.700 --> 03:01.759
I had to get Harris to
watch Mary and Mark.

03:01.760 --> 03:04.190
We had to lie and tell her
she'd get money for it.

03:04.260 --> 03:05.840
That's gonna be a fight later.

03:07.360 --> 03:08.390
Sorry.

03:08.460 --> 03:10.220
Oh, Neil, this is my brother, D.J.,

03:10.260 --> 03:11.340
- and his wife, Geena.
- Oh, hey.

03:11.360 --> 03:12.400
- Hi.
- Hi.

03:12.450 --> 03:14.010
We were just talking
about whether people

03:14.030 --> 03:16.630
tend to date the same
types over and over.

03:16.650 --> 03:18.740
- What do you think?
- Oh, pbht, absolutely.

03:18.800 --> 03:20.116
For... For example, I used to have

03:20.140 --> 03:22.640
a horribly self-destructive
thing for dominant women.

03:22.740 --> 03:24.770
They... Ugh.

03:24.800 --> 03:27.080
They'd push me around,
and I'd feel awful.

03:27.100 --> 03:29.050
But I... I got over that.

03:30.450 --> 03:32.580
By the way, I... I
really need to apologize

03:32.650 --> 03:34.380
for that whole shrimp thing. I...

03:35.350 --> 03:36.800
I don't know who that guy was.

03:38.500 --> 03:40.900
Oh, I think we all know who that was.

04:19.100 --> 04:20.200
"The Conners" is recorded

04:20.209 --> 04:22.120
in front of a live studio audience.

04:22.340 --> 04:23.920
Just broke up with Neil.

04:23.960 --> 04:26.000
Ohh. How'd he take it?

04:26.160 --> 04:28.670
Uh, he was devastated

04:28.700 --> 04:30.940
until I told him that he wasn't.

04:32.920 --> 04:35.709
I can't believe I was about to
make the same mistake again.

04:35.710 --> 04:37.719
Well, it's never too late to change.

04:37.720 --> 04:40.580
I've found that vocalizing
my feelings really helps.

04:40.600 --> 04:44.800
Last night, I suggested that
Peter might want to get a job,

04:45.020 --> 04:48.690
and he started packing his bags,

04:48.790 --> 04:51.360
and I decided to vocalize

04:51.460 --> 04:54.260
that I would do anything if he stayed,

04:54.270 --> 04:55.970
and he stayed!

04:58.900 --> 05:01.020
That just seems like desperation.

05:01.060 --> 05:04.040
Mm. To the untrained eye.

05:09.160 --> 05:11.380
I could use a laugh. What's that?

05:11.420 --> 05:12.830
I needed something to read, so I grabbed

05:12.850 --> 05:14.120
the new edition of Lock 'Em Up

05:14.220 --> 05:16.150
off the counter at the AM-PM.

05:16.250 --> 05:19.219
Ah, nothing says "fine literature"

05:19.220 --> 05:21.980
like the counter at the AM-PM.

05:22.140 --> 05:23.430
No, it's a hoot.

05:23.530 --> 05:25.176
They print the mug shots
of all the arrests

05:25.200 --> 05:27.030
in Lanford every month.

05:27.130 --> 05:29.630
This woman shot her
mother in her garage.

05:29.730 --> 05:31.700
She said she thought it was a weasel.

05:34.200 --> 05:36.910
Does it say if she got away with it?

05:36.920 --> 05:38.400
Oh, no. It doesn't matter.

05:38.410 --> 05:40.010
I don't have a garage.

05:42.010 --> 05:43.880
Well, the mug shots are pretty,

05:43.900 --> 05:45.780
but the real crime here is the writing.

05:46.960 --> 05:49.079
Oh, whoa. They're looking for a writer

05:49.080 --> 05:51.180
with copy-editing
experience. I have that.

05:51.320 --> 05:53.440
Yeah, but this is just
sensationalist garbage

05:53.460 --> 05:54.590
anybody could write.

05:54.630 --> 05:57.640
I know. I better get my
résumé together real quick.

05:58.330 --> 06:00.160
Okay, everybody get in here.

06:00.170 --> 06:01.720
I have news.

06:02.080 --> 06:03.850
All right, you're never
gonna believe this,

06:03.950 --> 06:06.620
but I wasn't nauseous at work
because I was hung over...

06:06.690 --> 06:08.020
Dad.

06:10.830 --> 06:12.730
I was sick because...

06:12.790 --> 06:13.930
I'm pregnant!

06:13.940 --> 06:14.950
Aaah!

06:17.200 --> 06:19.770
I can't believe it!

06:19.830 --> 06:21.000
Ohhhh!

06:21.020 --> 06:24.540
Your doctor gave you
less than a 5% chance!

06:24.640 --> 06:27.470
I know, but I had unsafe
sex, and it worked!

06:31.380 --> 06:33.880
You should speak at the high school.

06:34.900 --> 06:36.780
This is a full-on miracle.

06:36.800 --> 06:38.350
You were meant to be a mom.

06:38.420 --> 06:41.160
The doctor said that you were
too old and too pickled...

06:43.360 --> 06:47.130
... but God filled
that uterus with life.

06:48.740 --> 06:51.740
He didn't say "pickled."
Darlene said that.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.670
Oh, yeah, that was one of mine.

06:58.680 --> 07:00.580
We got to celebrate this now,

07:00.690 --> 07:01.879
'cause once the baby comes,

07:01.880 --> 07:03.689
you won't get a moment's peace.

07:03.690 --> 07:04.989
I had had to go to Afghanistan

07:04.990 --> 07:06.590
just to get a decent night's sleep.

07:08.820 --> 07:10.830
Mary thought she was always gonna
be the baby of the family.

07:10.850 --> 07:13.480
She's gonna learn what
every Conner learns...

07:13.550 --> 07:14.720
no one is special.

07:14.770 --> 07:15.820
Mm.

07:17.140 --> 07:18.220
To Becky.

07:18.290 --> 07:20.550
I think I speak for everyone when I say

07:20.560 --> 07:23.060
we can't wait to see how this plays out.

07:25.460 --> 07:27.260
God, I wish Mom was here.

07:27.700 --> 07:29.530
She would be so excited.

07:29.640 --> 07:31.000
She knows.

07:31.060 --> 07:33.660
So, you gonna tell us? Who's the father?

07:33.670 --> 07:34.940
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

07:35.040 --> 07:36.410
Whoa!

07:36.480 --> 07:38.000
Privacy, people.

07:38.010 --> 07:40.780
This is Becky's business
and nobody else.

07:44.400 --> 07:47.080
There is a father, biologically.

07:47.100 --> 07:48.400
I'm just not gonna tell him.

07:49.120 --> 07:51.350
I don't need a man to raise my kid.

07:51.420 --> 07:54.390
You know, it's not a crime for
a baby to have two parents.

07:54.460 --> 07:55.799
It's lovely to be independent,

07:55.800 --> 07:57.240
but not if the baby has to suffer

07:57.260 --> 07:59.660
because you don't have
the time or the money

07:59.770 --> 08:01.300
to take care of him properly.

08:01.470 --> 08:04.460
I'm not trying to prove
how independent I am.

08:05.240 --> 08:07.020
There's other reasons
I'm not telling him.

08:07.310 --> 08:08.400
Like what?

08:08.570 --> 08:10.410
Like it was a one-night stand.

08:12.180 --> 08:15.180
Oh. Well, let's check the Becky board.

08:16.250 --> 08:17.510
Number-one answer?

08:17.620 --> 08:19.480
Ding! "One-night stand."

08:22.350 --> 08:25.460
I'm just saying, I don't have
a relationship with the guy.

08:25.520 --> 08:27.740
He's a stranger, and I'm not gonna have

08:27.760 --> 08:29.860
a stranger telling me
how to raise my kid.

08:29.960 --> 08:31.290
He's still the father.

08:31.400 --> 08:33.559
The father has a right to know.

08:33.600 --> 08:36.100
And you're gonna need help with money.

08:36.169 --> 08:37.830
I got to let you go.

08:37.940 --> 08:39.740
You can't do drywall
when you're pregnant.

08:39.809 --> 08:41.870
Why not? Pregnant women
work all the time.

08:41.940 --> 08:43.150
Not on construction sites.

08:43.159 --> 08:46.120
They're dangerous and full
of all kinds of toxic stuff.

08:47.010 --> 08:49.080
You know how many babies
I've had to let go?

08:51.020 --> 08:53.320
And they always cry.

08:55.400 --> 08:56.990
So you're firing me?

08:57.000 --> 08:58.500
I really need the money.

08:58.680 --> 09:00.860
You can come back when
you have the baby.

09:02.100 --> 09:03.180
Wow.

09:03.200 --> 09:05.999
I wasn't looking for support
from the baby's father,

09:06.000 --> 09:08.800
but I thought I might get
some from my family.

09:11.380 --> 09:13.570
Where would she get that idea?

09:19.980 --> 09:22.200
Sorry. I didn't see a receptionist.

09:22.320 --> 09:24.350
People kept mistaking us
for The New York Times,

09:24.400 --> 09:25.980
so I had to let her go.

09:27.390 --> 09:29.040
Hey, I don't care how small it is.

09:29.050 --> 09:31.640
The fact that anything's being
published in Lanford at all

09:31.660 --> 09:32.660
is pretty sweet.

09:32.760 --> 09:34.460
I'm here about the job.

09:34.530 --> 09:36.260
Oh.

09:36.300 --> 09:39.000
Nice to meet you... Darlene Conner.

09:39.020 --> 09:40.320
Ben.

09:40.380 --> 09:41.606
If you turn out not to be a nut,

09:41.630 --> 09:43.300
I'll tell you my last name.

09:45.260 --> 09:48.580
Um, "waitress at the casino," huh?

09:48.810 --> 09:50.960
Humble brag.

09:52.710 --> 09:54.880
Why'd you leave the job
writing ad copy in Chicago?

09:55.180 --> 09:58.460
Oh, um, it was a combination of things.

09:58.580 --> 10:00.780
I hated the job, they paid nothing,

10:00.820 --> 10:02.920
and then they fired me...
that was the last straw.

10:04.160 --> 10:05.490
Why'd they fire you?

10:05.560 --> 10:07.040
They started using freelancers.

10:07.060 --> 10:08.540
But it worked out because
I had to come back

10:08.560 --> 10:09.570
to help my dad anyway.

10:09.590 --> 10:11.590
So this job would be perfect for me,

10:11.700 --> 10:15.000
and... and honestly, I think
I would be perfect for you

10:15.070 --> 10:16.500
because your paper right now

10:16.570 --> 10:18.470
is just full of a lot of dry facts,

10:18.540 --> 10:20.170
and I think that I could really make

10:20.180 --> 10:22.940
the arsonists and carjackers
people you want to know.

10:27.220 --> 10:28.240
No.

10:29.700 --> 10:32.020
People read this paper to see mug shots,

10:32.040 --> 10:33.849
find out who beat,
stabbed, or robbed who,

10:33.850 --> 10:35.520
and if they live next door.

10:35.590 --> 10:38.220
Oh, and if it's a relative, you know.

10:38.250 --> 10:40.620
Everybody likes to see an
in-law get taken down.

10:42.180 --> 10:44.730
Okay, cool, so, why don't
we take what you're doing

10:44.760 --> 10:46.380
and use that as a jumping-off place?

10:46.960 --> 10:50.070
Or we do what we're doing
and keep doing it.

10:51.720 --> 10:52.800
I get it.

10:52.820 --> 10:55.240
Go slow, don't freak the readers out...

10:55.310 --> 10:56.710
small changes first.

10:56.810 --> 10:59.820
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Or no changes,

11:00.150 --> 11:02.950
and then later...

11:03.010 --> 11:05.440
no changes.

11:06.580 --> 11:08.950
Oh, yeah. Okay. I hear you. I hear you.

11:09.020 --> 11:10.820
Deepen the story, but just a little

11:10.840 --> 11:12.720
until you see how much
better you like it.

11:13.680 --> 11:17.790
Or you do it precisely as I
say, and you can keep your job.

11:19.180 --> 11:20.960
Wait. Did you just hire me?

11:22.240 --> 11:23.470
Yes.

11:23.540 --> 11:24.760
Oh, and the pay sucks.

11:24.840 --> 11:27.300
- Ah, thank you!
- Yeah.

11:28.160 --> 11:30.480
That's your office. You
can go home at 6:00.

11:31.380 --> 11:32.940
Uh, I have kids.

11:33.010 --> 11:34.310
Oh. I'm sorry.

11:34.320 --> 11:38.110
Um, you can stay as late as you want.

11:40.950 --> 11:42.650
You know, when I first found out,

11:42.720 --> 11:44.360
I was so excited.

11:44.590 --> 11:48.020
But then I remembered I'm
43, on my own, and broke.

11:48.090 --> 11:49.540
Maybe your dad's right.

11:49.560 --> 11:52.130
Maybe you could bring the
baby's father into the mix,

11:52.230 --> 11:53.960
just to help with expenses.

11:54.070 --> 11:55.570
- Who is it?
- I can't tell you.

11:55.630 --> 11:56.670
All right, I get it.

11:56.770 --> 11:58.530
The sanctity of the intimate act,

11:58.600 --> 12:01.460
the stoic silence between lovers.

12:01.660 --> 12:04.200
No, I mean I don't know
who the hell it is.

12:05.600 --> 12:09.280
It's either Ramon, the manager,
or Emilio, the busboy.

12:09.380 --> 12:11.410
O-Oh, okay.

12:11.480 --> 12:13.960
A very mature, modern dilemma.

12:14.000 --> 12:17.140
Like many of our most
popular romantic comedies,

12:17.190 --> 12:19.490
but with much-needed diversity.

12:20.660 --> 12:23.330
Well, Ramon's the manager.

12:23.400 --> 12:25.300
Is it wrong to tell him he's the father

12:25.360 --> 12:27.000
just because he's in a better position

12:27.070 --> 12:29.270
to shell out a few bucks
to help with the baby?

12:29.330 --> 12:31.980
You are a mother. You do
what's best for the baby.

12:32.140 --> 12:33.470
Go, Ramon!

12:35.940 --> 12:38.300
Um, Ramon?

12:38.360 --> 12:40.910
The Sprite's low on CO2.

12:40.980 --> 12:43.920
Also, hey, I'm pregnant,
and you're the father.

12:45.020 --> 12:47.580
I know because I haven't
been with any other men.

12:47.680 --> 12:49.240
It's not mine.

12:49.420 --> 12:50.840
Normal reaction.

12:50.940 --> 12:53.320
No one feels it can happen to them.

12:53.460 --> 12:55.360
But here we are.

12:55.430 --> 12:57.040
And I'm sure you'll do the right thing

12:57.060 --> 12:58.540
by helping me financially.

12:58.730 --> 13:00.030
I had a vasectomy.

13:00.900 --> 13:03.840
Ironically, that used
to be music to my ears.

13:06.940 --> 13:09.240
I assume I'm working
holidays for a while.

13:12.610 --> 13:13.680
It's the busboy.

13:13.780 --> 13:15.350
Ohhh!

13:15.410 --> 13:16.820
Well, think!

13:16.860 --> 13:18.656
There's got to be somebody
else you slept with

13:18.680 --> 13:20.560
that's got money.

13:20.580 --> 13:22.719
Hey. It is told to me,

13:22.720 --> 13:25.820
um, you have my baby?

13:25.840 --> 13:27.140
Who told you that?

13:27.390 --> 13:28.520
Ramon.

13:28.590 --> 13:30.660
He said it is me.

13:30.720 --> 13:32.460
This is gonna get complicated.

13:32.560 --> 13:34.060
Could you help me out?

13:34.130 --> 13:36.270
The only thing I know how
to say in Spanish is "Yes."

13:36.300 --> 13:38.400
Yeah, I figured that out.

13:40.760 --> 13:43.240
Just tell him the truth.

13:43.320 --> 13:45.139
_

13:46.300 --> 13:50.020
_

13:50.320 --> 13:52.020
_

13:52.060 --> 13:54.640
_

13:54.690 --> 13:57.280
_

13:57.300 --> 13:59.640
_

13:59.680 --> 14:00.759
Mm.

14:00.760 --> 14:03.600
_

14:05.710 --> 14:08.140
_

14:08.170 --> 14:09.170
Oh, sí.

14:09.200 --> 14:11.370
Oh, he wants to take care of the baby.

14:11.470 --> 14:13.640
The rest, I'm... I don't... I...

14:15.640 --> 14:17.370
Muchos gracias.

14:17.480 --> 14:19.980
No baby help, por favor.

14:20.080 --> 14:21.120
No.

14:30.220 --> 14:32.040
He's not giving up,

14:32.490 --> 14:35.820
but first, he's going to fix the Sprite.

14:40.070 --> 14:41.680
_

14:41.720 --> 14:47.060
_

14:47.100 --> 14:51.480
_

14:51.560 --> 14:55.660
_

14:55.780 --> 14:58.280
That must be hard for you
to do this type of work.

14:58.760 --> 15:00.620
_

15:00.720 --> 15:02.760
_

15:02.800 --> 15:04.660
_

15:04.700 --> 15:06.760
_

15:06.980 --> 15:09.920
You're a good man, Emilio.
And I can help you.

15:09.990 --> 15:13.260
Not only am I Lanford's
leading certified life coach,

15:13.300 --> 15:14.990
I can also teach you English.

15:15.060 --> 15:16.280
Gracias.

15:16.340 --> 15:17.800
_

15:17.860 --> 15:19.099
_

15:19.100 --> 15:20.630
Mm.

15:22.440 --> 15:23.640
Hey, Becky.

15:23.680 --> 15:25.470
Hey, Maria. Hey, Bridget.

15:25.540 --> 15:26.840
Are you guys ready to order?

15:26.910 --> 15:28.810
Yeah, two taco combos, please.

15:28.910 --> 15:30.380
And three margaritas.

15:30.440 --> 15:32.180
Throw in a margarita for yourself.

15:33.980 --> 15:35.080
Are you okay?

15:36.680 --> 15:38.820
I'm experiencing a miracle.

15:38.920 --> 15:40.540
It's a very small gesture.

15:40.550 --> 15:42.750
It's like $2, and they're mostly ice.

15:44.770 --> 15:46.600
I can't drink. I'm pregnant.

15:46.990 --> 15:49.919
Becky! I'm so happy for you!

15:49.920 --> 15:51.099
You should be happy.

15:51.100 --> 15:52.380
We've been trying for years,

15:52.400 --> 15:54.400
but Maria has a tilted uterus,

15:54.430 --> 15:56.030
and I'm shooting blanks.

15:57.000 --> 16:00.110
I don't know if I can afford this baby.

16:00.170 --> 16:04.740
I just lost my second
job, the dad can't help,

16:04.810 --> 16:07.320
and...

16:07.420 --> 16:09.080
... I just...

16:09.380 --> 16:12.180
Oh, honey, it's gonna be okay.

16:12.450 --> 16:13.950
Thanks, guys.

16:14.020 --> 16:15.720
Let me get you your drinks.

16:19.120 --> 16:21.340
This might sound kind of cold,

16:21.360 --> 16:22.930
but I want her baby.

16:24.140 --> 16:27.030
Maria, we're not dingoes.

16:27.050 --> 16:29.120
But Becky might be the perfect person.

16:29.140 --> 16:31.140
I mean, we know her, she knows us.

16:31.200 --> 16:33.150
She could even still be
involved in the baby's life.

16:33.170 --> 16:34.810
It's good for everybody.

16:34.880 --> 16:38.640
It's a huge decision for us
that we shouldn't take lightly.

16:38.710 --> 16:41.080
Let me pound some margaritas,
and we'll talk about it.

16:42.820 --> 16:44.880
It's a little rough, but check it out.

16:46.150 --> 16:50.050
"Driven by years of closed doors
and systematic oppression,

16:50.120 --> 16:53.640
Eddie Ray Garrett lunged at
the gas station cashier,

16:53.660 --> 16:55.620
who ended Eddie's career of crime

16:55.640 --> 16:57.060
with a full...

16:57.130 --> 16:59.760
UNICEF can to the temple."

17:02.020 --> 17:03.980
The title is "Give Till It Hurts."

17:04.000 --> 17:05.660
Pretty great, right?

17:05.940 --> 17:07.619
No!

17:07.940 --> 17:09.040
Very great?

17:10.319 --> 17:12.680
You have overestimated

17:12.710 --> 17:14.440
the reading level of our audience.

17:14.460 --> 17:15.800
Okay? Uh...

17:15.819 --> 17:17.900
- You ever seen "Frankenstein"?
- Yeah.

17:17.920 --> 17:20.490
Okay, that's the reading
level of our audience.

17:21.760 --> 17:23.720
And not the doctor... the creature.

17:24.819 --> 17:28.540
I'll give you till "he
lunged at the cashier,"

17:28.560 --> 17:30.180
but then we're out.

17:30.430 --> 17:32.399
Okay, but let's just say

17:32.400 --> 17:35.500
we raise the quality of the writing.

17:35.570 --> 17:37.570
Then we get the doctor and the creature,

17:37.640 --> 17:39.270
and we increase our ad revenue.

17:39.340 --> 17:41.210
Look.

17:41.270 --> 17:43.240
You're clearly intelligent

17:43.310 --> 17:47.340
and have an... obnoxious
kind of integrity.

17:48.660 --> 17:51.750
That is dangerously
close to a compliment.

17:51.850 --> 17:53.880
Well, you can consider
it one if you want.

17:53.890 --> 17:55.690
It wasn't meant that way.

17:56.620 --> 18:01.700
And you are remarkably
stubborn and self-sabotaging.

18:02.820 --> 18:05.200
I was wondering when
you were gonna notice.

18:07.460 --> 18:11.240
Seriously, you've built
something great here.

18:11.340 --> 18:14.110
It's fascinating, it's macabre.

18:14.210 --> 18:15.650
But you just haven't even started

18:15.680 --> 18:17.780
to exploit it properly yet.

18:23.050 --> 18:24.920
That's where I keep my paper clips.

18:27.120 --> 18:29.140
And a dead moth, apparently.

18:30.880 --> 18:33.060
Look, here's the thing.

18:33.160 --> 18:35.930
The colorful writing is just the start.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.880
There is so much more we can do here.

18:38.920 --> 18:41.330
For example, I can
create a website for us.

18:41.370 --> 18:43.660
That's a great way to
attract younger readers.

18:43.940 --> 18:46.050
You know how to create a website?

18:46.080 --> 18:49.240
I do. I can have it up and
running in two weeks.

18:51.080 --> 18:52.540
Okay.

18:52.650 --> 18:54.450
Here's what I'll do.

18:54.510 --> 18:56.750
You are now the managing editor

18:56.780 --> 18:59.580
in charge of our new
Internet Department.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.720
And...

19:01.790 --> 19:04.800
And you get 10% of all
the income you generate.

19:04.990 --> 19:06.850
Oh. And I have complete
creative control.

19:06.890 --> 19:08.560
Not even close.

19:10.760 --> 19:12.300
Hey, let's celebrate, huh?

19:12.400 --> 19:13.700
Dinner's on me.

19:14.630 --> 19:16.580
Desperate and hungry,

19:16.600 --> 19:18.970
he... lunged for his phone.

19:21.420 --> 19:22.430
Okay.

19:23.680 --> 19:25.300
Now you're just being a jerk.

19:26.750 --> 19:28.600
Oh, it's busy.

19:28.660 --> 19:29.920
Well, I think I speak

19:29.940 --> 19:31.719
for everyone in the Internet Department

19:31.720 --> 19:34.090
when I say I think we
can go out for dinner.

19:34.190 --> 19:35.420
What do you like?

19:35.520 --> 19:37.080
Uh, Chinese?

19:37.180 --> 19:39.060
I could go for some shrimp fried rice.

19:40.760 --> 19:42.730
Um...

19:45.060 --> 19:47.530
You probably... You
probably don't know this.

19:47.630 --> 19:50.850
Uh, most of the shrimp we eat
isn't processed ethically,

19:50.860 --> 19:52.540
so you don't want to get that.

19:53.310 --> 19:55.010
Ohhh.

19:55.110 --> 19:56.390
You're confused.

19:56.410 --> 19:58.140
You thought I was a child,

19:58.180 --> 20:01.010
when I'm actually a grown-ass adult.

20:04.220 --> 20:07.440
Yeah. I-I didn't mean to push.
That's not who I am.

20:07.450 --> 20:08.490
Oh, great.

20:10.190 --> 20:11.190
Let's go.

20:13.100 --> 20:14.830
Hope you like 'em thick.

20:14.860 --> 20:17.160
I just about burned out the motor.

20:22.100 --> 20:23.670
We're gonna need spoons.

20:26.270 --> 20:27.760
So, when you and Mom found out

20:27.770 --> 20:29.459
you were gonna have
me, did you freak out?

20:29.460 --> 20:30.479
Only a little.

20:30.480 --> 20:33.060
We didn't know how bad
you were gonna turn out.

20:34.260 --> 20:36.680
The truth is, I remember thinking,

20:36.780 --> 20:39.320
"Oh, my God. I got to be a grown-up now.

20:39.420 --> 20:44.060
I got to buy life insurance,
mutual funds, save for college."

20:44.120 --> 20:47.890
But after a couple of years,
that panic goes away.

20:47.990 --> 20:49.660
And you just forget about that stuff.

20:52.330 --> 20:54.530
At least you had Mom
to go through it with.

20:54.630 --> 20:55.900
Yeah.

20:56.300 --> 20:58.509
Two parents isn't the worst
thing in the world to have.

20:58.510 --> 21:00.470
Just doing milkshakes now, Dad.
