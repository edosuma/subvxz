I've put together a rough translation,

08:30.680 --> 08:34.025
_ Dates back to the time of
King Solomon, who, apparently,

08:34.120 --> 08:36.304
commissioned it to keep tabs
on the Queen of Sheba,

08:36.400 --> 08:40.177

was half angel.

08:40.280 --> 08:41.907
She was a Nephilim?

08:42.160 --> 08:44.105
So what you're saying is that
King Solomon created a spell

08:44.200 --> 08:45.667
so that he could stalk his girlfriend?

08:45.760 --> 08:47.739
Yeah. And it looks like it works.

08:47.880 --> 08:49.302

No. What I want is in a

somewhere on Shrike's farm.

and bring it back to me.

- Why don't you rob him yourself?

there's what I know
and what I don't know.

11:29.080 --> 11:33.426

Smash can crack the safe,

11:33.600 --> 11:38.139

11:43.200 --> 11:46.340
Okay, tell me,
how does Shrike get into his vault?

11:48.120 --> 11:50.145
He uses his own blood.

11:50.680 --> 11:53.103
So he's been to Hell?
What's he, a demon?

11:53.840 --> 11:56.058
Luther gets around, but he is human.

11:56.160 --> 11:59.459
Not one of the good ones.
He's a sadist, a murderer,

11:59.560 --> 12:01.903
who'll do anything and everything to
add to his collection.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.581
All right, seriously,
what does he have of yours?

12:05.000 --> 12:07.582
It's important to me,
that's all you need to know.

12:09.680 --> 12:11.500
Sorry, that's not good enough.

12:12.840 --> 12:14.705
Put it another way.

12:14.800 --> 12:18.497
Take the deal or I give
the spell to Asmodeus.

12:18.600 --> 12:21.239
I've made a copy
of your half, obviously.

12:21.320 --> 12:24.380
Did I neglect to mention?
He's looking for your boy too.

12:25.840 --> 12:27.626
But here's the thing, I don't trust him.

12:27.720 --> 12:29.460
Of course, I don't trust you either,
but I trust him less,

12:29.600 --> 12:32.945
so you get dibs. For now.

12:42.680 --> 12:45.319
All right, well, I've seen this

12:49.840 --> 12:51.785
and it does, until bang,

12:51.880 --> 12:54.462
and everything goes screaming
off the rails and it's our asses.

12:54.640 --> 12:55.982
- Dean.
- You know, he's gonna screw us over

12:56.080 --> 12:57.980
-the first chance he gets.
- Not if we screw him over first.

12:58.080 --> 13:00.389
Listen, we want that spell, right?

13:00.480 --> 13:02.186
We need that spell and
we definitely don't want

13:02.280 --> 13:04.225
Asmodeus getting his hands on it.

13:04.320 --> 13:06.959
So, let's do this,

13:07.040 --> 13:08.780
have him hand over
the other half of the spell.

13:08.880 --> 13:10.620
And then?

13:10.720 --> 13:14.907
And then, just like you said,
we kill him.

13:15.760 --> 13:16.784
Okay.

13:19.520 --> 13:20.589
(YAWNING)

13:25.640 --> 13:28.746

- Yeah, you could say that.

All right, look, if we're doing this,

13:31.160 --> 13:33.424

13:33.560 --> 13:35.869
We need a distraction.

I'm all ears. See boys, it's kismet,
us working together.

LUTHER: They're coming.

13:44.680 --> 13:46.944
Asmodeus isn't your enemy.

13:48.560 --> 13:51.461
He wants to use me as bait.

13:51.600 --> 13:54.819
Barthamus is coming, Luther.

31:40.160 --> 31:41.149
That was awesome.

31:49.920 --> 31:52.423
All right, Shrike's all tied back up.
Man, is he pissed.

31:52.520 --> 31:54.499
Yeah. Wouldn't you be?

31:54.640 --> 31:56.346
- How are we looking? Can you open it?
-(SCOFFS)

31:57.480 --> 32:00.301
Dean, I bet no one's seen a safe like
that in over 100 years.

32:01.720 --> 32:03.221
I have.

32:03.320 --> 32:04.423
Oh.

32:04.520 --> 32:07.227
Look who decided to show.
Why'd you cottontail?

32:08.920 --> 32:10.387
You think I wanna be here?

32:10.480 --> 32:12.937
- Like I have a choice?
- You made a deal.

32:13.160 --> 32:14.627
Wow. You think?

32:17.440 --> 32:19.146
You sold your soul.

32:19.920 --> 32:21.945
And if I could take it back, I would,

32:22.040 --> 32:25.020
but, sorry Charlie, I can't.

32:25.120 --> 32:27.099
So here I am.
And as long as I keep working for him,

32:27.200 --> 32:29.304
Bart never collects.

32:29.440 --> 32:31.021
So you gonna let me do my thing or what?

32:31.120 --> 32:33.497
- Look, it doesn't have to be that way.
- You know, we could help you.

32:33.600 --> 32:35.067
No, you can't.

32:36.960 --> 32:38.746
I gotta take care of me.

Get out.

34:54.960 --> 34:57.861
It make you feel good,
whoring yourselves out to pure evil?

34:57.960 --> 34:59.461
Because that's what he is.

35:01.240 --> 35:03.743
What he did to me, my little boy.

35:03.840 --> 35:05.307
What are you talking about?

35:05.400 --> 35:09.461
My son. He was sick, dying,

35:09.560 --> 35:12.666
so I found Bart,
and I traded my life for his.

35:13.440 --> 35:15.021
My boy got better,

35:15.120 --> 35:17.577
but a few years later, he died anyway.

35:18.560 --> 35:19.879
He drowned.

35:20.600 --> 35:23.580
You know what Bart told me then?
He said, "Accidents happen."

35:23.680 --> 35:25.864
That he couldn't be held responsible.

35:27.400 --> 35:28.537
So what did you do?

35:29.120 --> 35:31.463
When the hounds came,
and dragged me to Hell,

35:31.560 --> 35:33.221
I negotiated a new deal.

35:34.840 --> 35:36.660
- How?
- Leverage.

35:37.480 --> 35:38.469
What kind of leverage?

35:39.280 --> 35:40.417

36:12.680 --> 36:14.500
You burn them, he dies.

36:20.040 --> 36:21.905
You're on the wrong side of this, boys.

36:23.200 --> 36:25.418
You gotta ask yourselves
if you can live with that.

left the house.

36:48.560 --> 36:49.879
Trust me, he had it coming.

36:50.760 --> 36:51.977
You let his son die.

36:52.480 --> 36:55.040
Well, he didn't read the fine print,
and I am a business man.

You two do-gooding idiots

are willing to welch on our deal,
throw away the only chance you have

37:30.560 --> 37:31.948
at finding your boy, because I killed

37:32.040 --> 37:35.066

piece of garbage, is that it?
