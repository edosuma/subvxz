00:13.013 --> 00:15.766
<i>You wanna hear a story about dragons?</i>

00:15.766 --> 00:17.851
<i>Everybody's got a favorite, right?</i>

00:17.851 --> 00:20.687
<i>Attacking villagers,
threatening fair maidens,</i>

00:20.687 --> 00:23.106
<i>hoarding piles of gold.</i>

00:23.106 --> 00:26.068
<i>Those stories about dragons
that terrorized the Vikings</i>

00:26.068 --> 00:27.778
<i>in the northern seas?</i>

00:27.778 --> 00:30.447
<i>Yeah. Yeah,
those are some of my favorites.</i>

00:30.447 --> 00:31.823
<i>Of course,</i>

00:31.823 --> 00:34.660
<i>those stories are just</i> stories <i>, right?</i>

00:34.660 --> 00:35.994
<i>Dragons don't really exist.</i>

00:35.994 --> 00:38.914
<i>They're just... They're just myths
a‐and legends.</i>

00:38.914 --> 00:41.625
<i>You know,
stuff to scare kids.</i>

00:41.625 --> 00:44.545
<i>But I've got a dragon story
you haven't heard.</i>

00:44.545 --> 00:47.256
<i>A story that really happened,</i>

00:47.256 --> 00:49.007
<i>and this story?</i>

00:49.007 --> 00:52.261
<i>This one is my absolute favorite</i>

00:52.261 --> 00:55.097
<i>because this story is mine.</i>

01:24.751 --> 01:26.879
This thing go any faster, Mom?

01:26.879 --> 01:30.257
‐ Any faster, Tom,
and the blades will come off.

01:30.257 --> 01:32.134
Okay. Just ahead,

01:32.134 --> 01:33.927
over this row of trees.

01:33.927 --> 01:37.139
You ready for this?
‐ I think you know the answer to that.

01:37.973 --> 01:39.516
Whoa!

01:39.516 --> 01:42.019
The Kullersen Fissure.

01:44.062 --> 01:46.231
How deep <i>is</i> that thing?

01:46.231 --> 01:48.692
It's been scanned to be
deeper than the Mariana.

01:48.692 --> 01:50.527
Over seven miles down.

01:50.527 --> 01:53.614
Of course, at that depth,
you find poisonous gas,

01:53.614 --> 01:56.700
razor sharp rocks, rivers of lava.

01:57.159 --> 01:58.827
‐ You had me at poisonous gas.

02:18.764 --> 02:21.433
Is that...
‐ Project ICARIS.

02:26.897 --> 02:28.982
‐ No way...

02:28.982 --> 02:30.734
‐ ICARIS 1 on approach.

02:30.734 --> 02:32.569
MAN <i>Come around back,
ICARIS 1.</i>

02:32.569 --> 02:36.281
<i>We're just finishing
a cargo drop and getting
the VTOL outta your way.</i>

02:52.798 --> 02:55.175
‐ Alright. Let's head to the fissure.

02:55.175 --> 02:57.177
Ah! A... hat?

02:59.805 --> 03:02.015
‐ Thomas, how you've grown!

03:02.015 --> 03:03.433
The last time I saw you,

03:03.433 --> 03:05.811
you jumped into the polar bear
habitat at the zoo.

03:05.811 --> 03:07.521
What a ruckus!

03:07.521 --> 03:09.523
Hope you learned from that experience.

03:12.609 --> 03:13.819
Dr. Kullersen!

03:13.819 --> 03:16.905
‐ Director Wong. You remember Mrs. Wong.

03:16.905 --> 03:18.782
‐ I remember the <i>hat</i>.

03:19.324 --> 03:21.952
‐ Welcome to Project ICARIS. Follow me.

03:23.203 --> 03:25.873
‐ How are the preparations coming along?
‐ Ah, well,

03:25.873 --> 03:29.126
as with any new project,
we've had our little bumps.

03:30.252 --> 03:32.296
You both must be exhausted from the trip.

03:32.296 --> 03:34.339
‐ Ah!

03:34.339 --> 03:37.509
Actually, the earthquakes
you mentioned have me concerned.

03:37.509 --> 03:38.802
I'd like to see the data.

03:38.802 --> 03:40.971
That's the Olivia
I know and love.

03:40.971 --> 03:42.723
Rest is for the weak.

03:43.765 --> 03:45.184
Thomas!

03:46.560 --> 03:49.229
I'm stealing your mother!
My daughter will show you around.

03:49.229 --> 03:51.481
You remember my Jun Bug, don't you?

03:51.481 --> 03:53.984
‐ You two were so cute
together when you were 6.

03:53.984 --> 03:55.819
‐ Jun? Uh...

03:55.819 --> 03:57.279
Yeah? Yeah.

03:57.279 --> 03:59.072
‐ Jun, you remember Tom.

03:59.072 --> 04:01.116
When you're done playing
with your magical cards,

04:01.116 --> 04:03.744
can you help him find orientation?

04:03.744 --> 04:06.538
‐ They're tarot cards, Mom.
They're not magic.

04:06.538 --> 04:07.748
‐ Yes.

04:07.748 --> 04:11.835
And they're showing me a future
where you don't reach your potential.

04:11.835 --> 04:13.212
This way, Olivia!

04:17.216 --> 04:19.426
‐ Mom! What about
checking out the fissure?

04:29.186 --> 04:31.563
Hey!
‐ Hey yourself.

04:31.563 --> 04:33.357
You look different than I remember.

04:33.357 --> 04:35.359
‐ A lot can change in eight years.

04:36.360 --> 04:37.778
So, uh,

04:37.778 --> 04:40.656
where's this orientation
thing supposed to happen?

04:40.656 --> 04:43.450
‐ It'll be in the ICARIS Visitor's Center.

04:43.450 --> 04:46.370
We'll be heading there once
the other students arrive.

04:46.370 --> 04:48.497
‐ I'm here, Pops! And I am...

04:48.497 --> 04:50.249
on time!

04:50.749 --> 04:53.877
‐ We're still waiting on one more teen.

04:54.336 --> 04:55.587
‐ Uh, Pops?

04:56.463 --> 04:58.465
‐ Whoa! Where'd you come from?

05:01.635 --> 05:04.930
Alright. Everyone,
close order on my son here.

05:09.893 --> 05:12.396
That means shoulder to shoulder! Move!

05:14.147 --> 05:16.400
Okay, we have D'Angelo Baker.

05:16.400 --> 05:18.527
‐ Here! I mean,

05:18.527 --> 05:20.696
you already knew that.

05:20.696 --> 05:21.864
‐ Jun Wong.

05:22.281 --> 05:24.992
‐ Present in this dimensional timeline.

05:27.452 --> 05:28.662
I'm here, too, Phil.

05:29.204 --> 05:30.873
‐ Tom Kullersen.

05:31.290 --> 05:33.750
‐ Yup! I am also here.

05:34.543 --> 05:36.253
‐ Alex Gonzalez.

05:39.089 --> 05:40.966
Sorry, what was that?

05:42.259 --> 05:43.260
‐ Here.

05:44.136 --> 05:45.888
‐ I can't hear you.

05:45.888 --> 05:47.347
She said "here."

05:54.188 --> 05:55.439
‐ Okay.

05:55.439 --> 05:57.858
For those of you who don't know,

05:57.858 --> 06:00.319
I am Security Chief Phillip Baker.

06:00.319 --> 06:02.738
Welcome to Project ICARIS.

06:02.738 --> 06:06.491
International Crevasse and Research
Investigation Station.

06:06.992 --> 06:09.578
Your safety orientation begins now.

06:11.788 --> 06:14.791
‐ Your name's Kullersen?
Like, named after the fissure?

06:14.791 --> 06:16.877
‐ Actually, it's named after my mom.

06:16.877 --> 06:18.879
She figured out the comet
would tear it open.

06:18.879 --> 06:20.881
‐ Yo, that is crazy!

06:20.881 --> 06:23.258
So, you're famous.
‐ More like infamous.

06:23.258 --> 06:26.220
He climbed into a polar bear
habitat when he was 5.

06:26.220 --> 06:29.806
Made the local news.
‐ In my defense,
the bear looked lonely.

06:29.806 --> 06:31.016
‐ Oh, man.

06:31.016 --> 06:32.726
Polar bears might look cute,

06:32.726 --> 06:34.895
but they can be very aggressive.

06:34.895 --> 06:36.563
‐ Nah. He just needed a friend.

06:36.563 --> 06:38.899
‐ Alright, everybody, simmer down.

06:39.608 --> 06:41.944
Except for you. You're fine.

06:41.944 --> 06:44.154
I like my elevator rides quiet.

06:52.955 --> 06:56.834
On this, the green floor,
you'll find our amazing research division.

06:56.834 --> 06:58.168
It is state of the art.

06:58.168 --> 07:00.462
‐ Nice.

07:00.462 --> 07:01.964
Children are not allowed.

07:03.340 --> 07:05.425
‐ Still leaping before you look?

07:07.135 --> 07:10.931
‐ The blue floor is home to our high tech
control center and security hub.

07:11.682 --> 07:14.059
The virtual brain of the station.

07:14.059 --> 07:16.895
<i>It</i> is state of the art.
Can we...

07:17.312 --> 07:20.315
‐ Children are not allowed.

07:20.315 --> 07:21.817
‐ What's on the red floor?

07:21.817 --> 07:23.151
‐ The hangar.

07:23.151 --> 07:24.736
It's a highly restricted area.

07:24.736 --> 07:27.114
Home to our explorer‐class drone fleet.

07:27.656 --> 07:30.284
It is state of the art.

07:30.284 --> 07:33.579
Children are <i>not</i> allowed.

07:33.579 --> 07:35.539
‐ So, where <i>are</i> children allowed?

07:39.084 --> 07:40.919
The Visitor's Center.

07:40.919 --> 07:42.588
You have three jobs while you're here.

07:42.588 --> 07:44.089
Number one, go to school.

07:44.089 --> 07:46.049
Number two, stay away from the fissure.

07:46.049 --> 07:47.968
And number three, make sure

07:47.968 --> 07:49.761
you stay away from the fissure.

07:49.761 --> 07:52.681
Look all you want, but touch nothing!

07:52.681 --> 07:55.475
When you're done looking, take a seat,
and we'll begin your first safety film.

08:15.287 --> 08:16.330
‐ Woo...

08:16.330 --> 08:18.290
Wow.

08:27.799 --> 08:28.842
Whoa...

08:28.842 --> 08:31.553
State of the art.

08:45.400 --> 08:46.401
Huh?

08:47.110 --> 08:49.112
What was that? A drone?

08:49.112 --> 08:50.739
‐ What are you doing out here?

08:50.739 --> 08:53.242
‐ I‐I saw something. It was...

08:55.661 --> 08:57.621
What is that?

08:57.621 --> 08:59.039
‐ Oh no...

08:59.039 --> 09:00.165
Earthquake!

09:01.834 --> 09:03.210
Ah!

09:12.219 --> 09:13.720
‐ Ah!

09:16.849 --> 09:18.934
‐ Get help!

09:34.825 --> 09:35.826
Whoa!

09:56.889 --> 09:59.099
‐ Whoa!

10:00.517 --> 10:03.770
‐ Ah! Not like this! I'm too young!

10:03.770 --> 10:05.022
I have a cat!

10:14.031 --> 10:15.574
‐ Whoa!

10:17.201 --> 10:18.368
‐ Whoa!

10:23.498 --> 10:27.044
‐ We're just... I don't know
what we're just... I can't...

10:39.389 --> 10:41.725
Ah!

10:44.353 --> 10:45.437
‐ I got you!

10:45.437 --> 10:48.440
I got you both! Climb up, Linda!

10:52.402 --> 10:54.404
‐ Did you see that?
‐ What?

10:54.404 --> 10:57.074
Our lives flashing before our eyes?

10:57.074 --> 11:00.160
‐ Tom! Are you okay?
‐ Mom! Mom!

11:00.160 --> 11:02.663
Hi, I‐I'm fine. I just saw something‐‐

11:05.457 --> 11:07.501
‐ What happened?
Earthquake.

11:08.252 --> 11:10.754
Falling. Screams.

11:10.754 --> 11:13.215
Death riding toward me on a pale horse.

11:13.215 --> 11:16.093
‐ Your son thought fast,
threw her a cable,

11:16.093 --> 11:17.594
saved her life.

11:19.847 --> 11:22.307
‐ Thomas? What are you doing down here?

11:22.307 --> 11:24.643
This is a restricted area.

11:24.643 --> 11:27.479
‐ Oh! I‐I...
‐ Wait a minute.

11:27.479 --> 11:29.398
You weren't supposed to be down here?

11:29.398 --> 11:30.774
‐ Well, no...

11:30.774 --> 11:32.943
See, the elevator doors
were closing, and I couldn't‐‐

11:32.943 --> 11:35.821
‐ Oh, Tom! From now on,

11:35.821 --> 11:38.490
he will only be where
he's supposed to be. Right?

11:41.702 --> 11:44.204
‐ Chief Baker,
show the Kullersens to their dome.

11:50.752 --> 11:51.962
One moment, Olivia.

11:53.130 --> 11:55.883
I think we were both
hoping that Tom had matured

11:55.883 --> 11:58.969
beyond the "swimming with polar bears"
phase of his development.

11:59.761 --> 12:03.390
‐ He has.
I promise you, May, he has.

12:03.932 --> 12:06.435
And if he hasn't, he's going to.

12:10.022 --> 12:12.191
‐ What you did back there...

12:12.191 --> 12:13.525
Pretty stupid.

12:14.860 --> 12:16.528
But pretty brave, too.

12:20.157 --> 12:21.867
You gotta understand

12:21.867 --> 12:24.203
that fissure is dangerous, son.

12:24.203 --> 12:26.246
No one knows how deep that thing is.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.624
If you fell in,
you might never hit the bottom.

12:32.211 --> 12:35.214
I'm glad I'm not you right now.

12:45.599 --> 12:47.476
‐ This place is pretty nice.

12:47.476 --> 12:49.853
Feels very... domey.

12:53.357 --> 12:55.859
Look, I know you're mad, but...

12:58.695 --> 13:00.989
So, uh,

13:00.989 --> 13:03.992
maybe after we unpack,
we can wander around?

13:04.910 --> 13:06.870
I think I saw something in the fissure.

13:06.870 --> 13:09.665
‐ The fissure you weren't
supposed to be near?

13:09.665 --> 13:12.626
‐ Yeah. Yeah, that fissure.
‐ Tom!

13:12.626 --> 13:15.879
You totally went against everything
we talked about before we got here.

13:16.213 --> 13:18.507
I know you're excited. I am, too.

13:18.507 --> 13:20.884
But, you cannot, under any circumstances,

13:20.884 --> 13:23.637
sneak around places
that could get you killed.

13:23.971 --> 13:25.722
‐ Okay, okay, I get it.

13:25.722 --> 13:27.975
I just wanted to see the drone fleet.

13:27.975 --> 13:29.810
And I didn't know
an earthquake was coming.

13:29.810 --> 13:31.854
‐ You have a drone. Look at that.

13:32.604 --> 13:34.147
‐ It's not the same thing.

13:34.147 --> 13:36.275
‐ We have been here barely an hour,

13:36.275 --> 13:38.277
and we almost had a tragedy.

13:38.277 --> 13:40.571
Not the best first impression.

13:40.904 --> 13:42.656
‐ Okay, I admit it.

13:42.656 --> 13:45.868
The drone mission was misguided.
I should've stayed with the group.

13:51.707 --> 13:53.250
But, come on, Mom.

13:53.250 --> 13:55.210
We come from Vikings!

13:55.210 --> 13:58.505
We don't ask for permission!
We don't care what other people think!

13:58.505 --> 14:00.799
<i>We crave adventure!</i>

14:00.799 --> 14:04.136
‐ There won't be any adventure
if you keep breaking the rules.

14:04.136 --> 14:06.430
‐ Rules are for suckers.

14:06.430 --> 14:08.557
‐ You <i>will</i> complete

14:08.557 --> 14:11.101
the safety orientation videos.

14:13.854 --> 14:15.355
Or die by the sword!

14:15.981 --> 14:17.649
‐ Now, she <i>wants</i> me dead.

14:17.649 --> 14:20.444
How quickly we forget.
You'll never defeat me!

14:20.444 --> 14:23.322
This umbrella is state of the art!

14:23.322 --> 14:25.282
‐ Oh, but I will

14:25.282 --> 14:29.036
because I am your mother
and have responsibilities!

14:29.036 --> 14:31.580
‐ I see your responsibilities
and raise you

14:31.580 --> 14:33.874
one independent teenager.

14:33.874 --> 14:35.918
‐ Parental duty!

14:35.918 --> 14:37.211
‐ Teen angst!

14:38.879 --> 14:41.256
Oh man...

14:43.884 --> 14:46.178
‐ We gotta behave ourselves, boyo.

14:46.178 --> 14:48.889
This expedition is even
bigger than I thought.

14:49.473 --> 14:52.476
Look at this place.
A lot of eyeballs are on us.

14:52.476 --> 14:55.854
‐ Well, can we at least use <i>our</i> eyeballs
and go look at the fissure?

14:55.854 --> 14:58.148
I'm serious. I think I saw something.

14:58.690 --> 15:00.817
‐ W‐what do you mean "saw something"?

15:02.277 --> 15:04.571
Oh, I gotta take this. Hello, May.

15:04.571 --> 15:07.783
No, sorry. I didn't forget.
I'm just getting Tom situated.

15:07.783 --> 15:09.868
Be right there. I gotta get back.

15:09.868 --> 15:11.161
They need me at the station.

15:11.161 --> 15:12.996
‐ What do I do while you're gone?

15:12.996 --> 15:15.916
‐ I don't know. Unpack. Play a video game.

15:15.916 --> 15:17.417
Gotta go. Love you.

15:19.586 --> 15:22.756
Stay <i>away</i> from that fissure.
Stay near the dome.

15:44.069 --> 15:46.947
‐ Huh. She said I couldn't
go near the fissure,

15:46.947 --> 15:48.949
but she didn't say
anything about my drone.

15:58.959 --> 16:01.545
Alright. Let's check out
the world's deepest hole

16:01.545 --> 16:03.839
and see if we can spot that flying thing.

16:03.839 --> 16:05.549
How do you like your dome?
‐ Ah!

16:06.091 --> 16:07.092
Hm?

16:07.509 --> 16:10.095
Well, they're all the same, right?
‐ Pretty much.

16:11.013 --> 16:13.015
How did you get up there?

16:15.475 --> 16:17.060
Help me.

16:25.068 --> 16:27.529
I heard what happened on the platform.

16:27.529 --> 16:29.656
‐ Wow. That was quick.

16:29.656 --> 16:31.283
‐ Well, when people almost die

16:31.283 --> 16:33.994
and a chunk of the station
falls into the fissure,

16:33.994 --> 16:36.288
word travels fast.

16:36.288 --> 16:37.623
‐ Good point.

16:37.623 --> 16:40.417
‐ Guess you're still the boy
who makes the local news.

16:40.417 --> 16:41.960
‐ I guess so.

16:42.544 --> 16:45.339
‐ I knew you were coming here,
you know. It was fated.

16:46.381 --> 16:47.382
‐ Fated?

16:48.008 --> 16:49.676
‐ Yeah. It was in the stars.

16:49.676 --> 16:51.094
I read your astrological chart.

16:53.722 --> 16:57.017
I‐I was just curious.
It doesn't mean anything.

16:57.017 --> 16:59.728
‐ Guess you're still the girl
who's into everything magical.

17:00.812 --> 17:02.940
‐ It's not magic,

17:02.940 --> 17:04.858
but yeah. I am.

17:06.568 --> 17:09.279
Okay, uh, what's the point of this toy?

17:09.279 --> 17:10.697
It's making me dizzy.

17:10.697 --> 17:13.659
‐ It's not a toy,
Jun. It's a drone.

17:13.659 --> 17:15.077
‐ It's a toy.

17:15.077 --> 17:16.745
‐ I saw something in the fissure earlier.

17:16.745 --> 17:18.288
Something flying.

17:18.997 --> 17:20.958
What do you mean? Like another drone?

17:21.416 --> 17:23.585
‐ No, no, bigger, faster.

17:23.585 --> 17:25.128
I don't know... different.

17:25.128 --> 17:27.881
‐ Well, your drone has
a camera on it, right?

17:27.881 --> 17:30.592
Let's go check it out.
‐ What do you think I'm trying to do?

17:30.592 --> 17:33.679
No, no, no, no, Jun!
Jun, it‐it takes a lot of practice to‐‐

17:33.679 --> 17:35.639
‐ Oh!

17:35.639 --> 17:38.225
Hey! This <i>is</i> kinda fun.

17:38.225 --> 17:41.019
Okay! Easy! These things are expensive.

17:41.019 --> 17:43.021
I got it, I got it.

17:45.774 --> 17:48.485
Oh. Sorry. My bad.

17:48.485 --> 17:49.778
Where did it go?

17:54.658 --> 17:57.703
I'm so sorry.

17:57.703 --> 17:59.496
‐ Never shaved a sheep before.

18:03.917 --> 18:05.335
You're welcome.

18:06.962 --> 18:09.339
‐ I should get going. It's getting late.

18:09.339 --> 18:11.466
You gonna be okay?
‐ Yeah.

18:11.466 --> 18:14.386
I'm just gonna take one more flight
and check out the fissure.

18:14.386 --> 18:15.596
‐ Your chart was right.

18:15.596 --> 18:18.348
You have
an unquenchable thirst for adventure.

18:18.765 --> 18:20.225
‐ I told you.

18:20.225 --> 18:22.811
I saw something weird.
I wanna take another look.

18:23.353 --> 18:24.980
‐ Just be careful.

18:24.980 --> 18:28.150
Like I said, you were fated
to be here. We both were,

18:28.150 --> 18:30.652
and something big happens.

18:31.528 --> 18:32.988
‐ Something big?

18:34.698 --> 18:36.241
‐ Life‐changing.

19:11.026 --> 19:13.862
‐ Okay. Where are you?

19:27.251 --> 19:28.669
There you are.

19:39.847 --> 19:41.223
What the...

19:52.526 --> 19:55.028
Okay. This is probably a bad idea.

20:24.099 --> 20:25.601
What <i>are</i> you?

20:26.602 --> 20:28.103
Whoa!

20:30.522 --> 20:33.108
Okay, time to go.

21:01.470 --> 21:02.971
A tail?

21:05.807 --> 21:08.310
Okay, okay, okay. Just‐‐ Just hold on.

21:19.446 --> 21:21.698
Okay, in there. Okay.
You can come out now.

21:50.978 --> 21:52.229
Oh...

22:04.700 --> 22:06.535
Go away! Go on! Get outta here!

22:29.016 --> 22:30.517
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

22:31.643 --> 22:33.562
Oh, you gotta be kidding me!
