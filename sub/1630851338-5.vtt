What is it?

There might

Thank you for walking
me to work, george.

01:09.770 --> 01:11.769
Not at all.
How's your leg?

01:11.806 --> 01:13.572
It's fine.

01:13.574 --> 01:15.974
I haven't been
to my office in months.

01:16.043 --> 01:17.509
It's understandable, effie.

You've been through

Well, who's to

01:40.901 --> 01:42.734
Although,
if you're the jockey,

01:42.736 --> 01:44.435

Can you tell me how you
came to be in the room

02:15.702 --> 02:16.768
With a dead man?

02:16.904 --> 02:19.037
I came in

Crabtree:
Who was this man?

02:37.057 --> 02:39.424
His name was juan de léon.

02:39.426 --> 02:41.627
I just met him
last night.

02:41.762 --> 02:43.862
What were you
doing in his room?

02:43.864 --> 02:45.730
I don't want to say.

02:45.766 --> 02:48.567
Aunt zinnia, just tell
the detective the truth.

02:48.569 --> 02:50.302
I met him
and lost my head.

02:50.371 --> 02:52.204
He was so handsome.

02:56.443 --> 02:57.809
Did you stay the night?

02:57.878 --> 03:00.479
What kind of lady
do you take me for?

03:04.151 --> 03:06.451
So, you came to
his room this morning?

03:06.453 --> 03:08.219
I couldn't stop
thinking about him.

03:08.255 --> 03:09.821
I came to his room,
the door was open,

03:09.890 --> 03:12.191
He was lying there
and then you came in.

03:12.326 --> 03:14.559
-Good day, mrs. Hart.
-Detective.

03:14.562 --> 03:16.161
Ah, sir.

03:17.932 --> 03:19.965
There's no way my aunt
could have done this.

03:20.100 --> 03:21.299
You know her well, then?

03:21.435 --> 03:24.035
Well, I used to and she's
hardly the murdering kind.

03:24.071 --> 03:25.970
Murdoch:
Right.

03:26.006 --> 03:27.839
Escort your aunt
down to the station house.

03:27.841 --> 03:30.775
I'll see what I can find
out about mr. De léon.

03:30.811 --> 03:33.244
Right.
Aunt zinnia, come with me.

03:35.983 --> 03:38.316
Oh, that poor man.
Such a shame.

03:38.385 --> 03:39.651
Don't you agree, georgie?

03:40.754 --> 03:41.853
Mrs. Hart?

03:41.922 --> 03:44.189
He was struck once with
a slim, heavy object.

03:44.258 --> 03:45.791
No defensive wounds.

03:45.926 --> 03:47.759
-Time of death?
-Recently.

03:47.761 --> 03:49.861
Rigor mortis has

03:52.399 --> 03:56.434
Spanish man?
Brown hair, thin moustache.

03:56.470 --> 03:58.336
Yeah, I threw him
out of here last night.

03:58.338 --> 03:59.771
Never cared for his type.

03:59.807 --> 04:01.807
I don't quite
take your meaning.

04:01.809 --> 04:03.542
The type that separates
wealthy, older women

04:03.677 --> 04:04.943
From all their money.

04:05.078 --> 04:06.678
A confidence man?

04:06.714 --> 04:09.247
All I know is he made
straight for an elderly lady

04:09.382 --> 04:11.483
Here last night and she was
dripping in diamonds.

04:11.552 --> 04:14.152
Sits down with her,
starts ordering champagne.

04:14.188 --> 04:16.088
All on her tab, of course.

04:17.291 --> 04:19.024
So, I asked him to leave.

04:19.026 --> 04:21.125
Told him I was onto him.

04:27.401 --> 04:29.567
This way, aunt zinnia.
I'll get you a seat.

04:30.604 --> 04:33.171
I'm so sorry about
all this, georgie.

04:33.173 --> 04:36.574
I didn't even know
you were in toronto.

04:36.576 --> 04:37.909
You should have called.

04:38.045 --> 04:40.045
Well, I've only
recently arrived.

04:40.114 --> 04:43.115
I was waiting until
I was a bit more settled

04:43.250 --> 04:46.384
And now I'm the furthest
thing from it.

04:46.420 --> 04:48.854
Listen, were you
completely truthful

04:48.989 --> 04:51.056
With detective
murdoch and I?

04:51.058 --> 04:52.658
What were you doing
in that man's room?

04:53.860 --> 04:56.395
What can I say, georgie?

04:56.397 --> 04:59.331
He caught my eye
and I his.

04:59.466 --> 05:00.665
I see.

05:00.734 --> 05:04.269
George, there's something
I didn't tell you.

05:04.404 --> 05:06.671
He may have had
a necklace of mine.

05:06.740 --> 05:08.273
Did you give it to him?

05:10.411 --> 05:12.944
George, he may have
taken it from me.

05:13.013 --> 05:16.013
I went to his room to
look for it, but...

05:16.050 --> 05:17.816
But he was dead?

05:17.885 --> 05:20.418
On my word, george.

05:20.487 --> 05:22.087
Oh, there-there.

05:22.089 --> 05:24.623
Perhaps you could you ask
the constables to have a look?

05:24.758 --> 05:27.959
It's gold with
a key-shaped pendant on it.

05:27.961 --> 05:29.828
Well, if it turns up,
we'll certainly let you know.

05:29.897 --> 05:31.162
Thank you.

05:32.433 --> 05:34.366
What a hat!

05:34.368 --> 05:36.768
Why, this old thing?

05:36.804 --> 05:39.838
I often wondered what
I'd wear to a police station.

05:39.840 --> 05:42.774
I've never been
to one before.

05:42.909 --> 05:45.243
Ah, what brings you here?

05:45.312 --> 05:47.979
Ah, detective watts,
this is my aunt zinnia.

05:47.981 --> 05:49.647
Your aunt zinnia?

05:49.717 --> 05:52.917
Pleased to meet you.
Are you here for a visit?

05:52.986 --> 05:56.855
Unfortunately, I'm here
under suspicion of murder.

05:56.857 --> 05:58.556
Watts:
Oh, dear.

05:58.625 --> 06:01.126
Well, if you're innocent,
you're in the best hands.

06:01.195 --> 06:03.828
If you're guilty...

06:05.499 --> 06:06.664
Good day!

06:09.937 --> 06:11.336
Brackenreid:
She was in the dead man's room.

06:11.338 --> 06:13.138
I hate to say it,
crabtree.

06:13.140 --> 06:15.340
Ah, sir, she was looking
for her necklace.

06:15.342 --> 06:16.942
He took it from her.

06:16.944 --> 06:19.077
[zinnia laughs in the distance]

06:19.212 --> 06:21.546
-She could be lying.
-I don't know, sir.

06:21.548 --> 06:24.682
I spoke to a bartender
who saw juan de léon last night.

06:24.684 --> 06:25.950
And?

06:26.085 --> 06:27.452
He had to kick him out,

06:27.587 --> 06:29.488
Believed him to be
a romantic swindler.

06:29.490 --> 06:30.755
Oh.

06:30.758 --> 06:32.557
You know,
I often wondered

06:32.593 --> 06:34.225
How one gets into
that line of work.

06:34.261 --> 06:36.194
Ah, more of a calling,
I suspect, sir.

06:36.196 --> 06:38.296
And you'd need to have
very few scruples.

06:38.332 --> 06:40.432
And, of course,
you'd also need to be handsome.

06:40.501 --> 06:42.500
What exactly are you
implying, crabtree?

06:42.569 --> 06:45.570
I've managed to track down
the woman that juan de léon

06:45.572 --> 06:46.971
Was swindling
last night.

06:47.040 --> 06:48.573
A constable is
bringing her in.

06:48.708 --> 06:51.209
Sirs, do you think it would be
possible to release my aunt?

06:51.278 --> 06:53.111
I highly doubt she's done
anything wrong here.

06:53.180 --> 06:57.048
[all laugh]

06:57.050 --> 06:58.917
Let me sort this
out first, george.

06:58.986 --> 07:00.218
Right.

07:03.056 --> 07:06.258
I'm so sorry I couldn't
be more help to you.

07:06.393 --> 07:07.459
Well, thank you
for coming in.

07:07.528 --> 07:10.127
Oh, such a shame.

07:10.164 --> 07:12.998
Mr. De léon
was so handsome.

07:13.133 --> 07:14.466
Hm.

07:14.601 --> 07:16.334
Miss o'neill!

07:16.403 --> 07:18.536
Miss o'neill?

07:18.672 --> 07:20.138
Alberta!

07:20.207 --> 07:22.207
Fancy meeting you here.

07:22.209 --> 07:25.010
What brings you
to a police station?

07:25.145 --> 07:27.746
Well, I was just
visiting my dear nephew,

07:27.881 --> 07:29.147
George crabtree.

07:29.149 --> 07:30.815
Oh.

07:30.818 --> 07:34.953
Your irish love potion
worked a treat last night.

07:35.088 --> 07:38.556
Not an hour after you
had me put it in my drink,

07:38.625 --> 07:42.159
I met the most
wonderful man.

07:42.196 --> 07:43.661
You did?

07:43.730 --> 07:48.366
But then mr. De léon was
thrown out of the establishment.

07:48.368 --> 07:50.635
Oh, my stars and garters.

07:50.704 --> 07:52.604
He gave me his card.

07:52.739 --> 07:56.841
And I must confess,
I was going to call on him,

07:56.844 --> 07:59.977
But then he
turned up dead.

08:03.583 --> 08:06.718
I will be wanting to purchase
more of your love potion.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.787
At your convenience,
of course.

08:11.458 --> 08:13.090
Thank you.

08:18.799 --> 08:20.165
I can explain.

08:20.167 --> 08:22.733
I met juan last night
and he asked me to help him

08:22.769 --> 08:24.336
With a silly little trick.

08:24.471 --> 08:26.804
I'd never done anything
like that before.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.406
I did it for the thrill.

08:28.408 --> 08:30.942
You gave miss binchey
love potion?

08:31.077 --> 08:32.677
It was just
coloured water.

08:32.812 --> 08:34.546
He asked me to speak
to the old dear,

08:34.615 --> 08:36.348
Have her put it
in her drink.

08:36.483 --> 08:38.750
I left.
He came in and charmed her.

08:38.819 --> 08:39.884
Aunt zinnia.

08:39.953 --> 08:41.219
He asked the lady
for a few dollars

08:41.354 --> 08:43.021
And the lady gets
a lovely evening.

08:43.090 --> 08:44.289
What's the harm?

08:44.424 --> 08:46.357
And it was just the once,
you swear?

08:46.393 --> 08:49.260
On my life, georgie.

08:55.002 --> 08:59.371
[groans]

08:59.373 --> 09:01.039
Don't be overly
dramatic, dear.

09:01.108 --> 09:02.840
It's not that dire.

09:02.876 --> 09:04.242
[groans]

09:04.377 --> 09:06.444
Dr. Deakins,
can I be of assistance?

09:06.446 --> 09:07.979
No, dr. Ogden.

09:07.981 --> 09:09.781
I'm quite capable of
handling a patient,

09:09.850 --> 09:12.284
Even one as hysterical
as miss robinson.

09:12.419 --> 09:14.386
I'm in so much pain,
doctor.

09:14.388 --> 09:17.388
Give her a dose of morphine
and put her in the ward, nurse.

09:17.523 --> 09:20.091
I must dash but prep her
tomorrow for a lithotripsy.

09:22.095 --> 09:23.728
So, the diagnosis
is a kidney stone?

09:23.797 --> 09:25.664
It's what the doctor said.

09:25.799 --> 09:28.466
[groans]

09:31.672 --> 09:33.071
Mister quivell?

09:33.140 --> 09:35.072
Please, have a seat.

09:35.108 --> 09:36.374
Yes.

09:38.745 --> 09:40.311
Whoo.

09:41.882 --> 09:43.615
Thank you for seeing me.

09:43.684 --> 09:45.016
What can I help you with?

09:45.018 --> 09:47.618
I am a private
investigator.

09:47.654 --> 09:49.621
Ah! And...

09:49.623 --> 09:52.691
I've been hired to locate
10,000 dollars,

09:52.826 --> 09:55.760
That juan de léon
swindled my client out of.

09:55.829 --> 09:58.163
Now that he's dead,
my job has become...

09:58.298 --> 09:59.898
A touch more difficult.

09:59.900 --> 10:01.699
My condolences.

10:01.735 --> 10:03.434
Who is your client?

10:03.470 --> 10:05.703
Ah! She would prefer
not to be named.

10:05.739 --> 10:07.706
I'm sure you understand.

10:07.841 --> 10:09.474
-I see.
-Mm-hm. Um...

10:09.543 --> 10:14.178
I also hear that you have
a miss zinnia hobson in custody.

10:15.349 --> 10:16.981
How do you know that?

10:17.017 --> 10:19.718
Well, I've been tracking her.
And mr. De léon.

10:19.853 --> 10:21.052
Both of them?

10:21.054 --> 10:23.588
Quivell: Detective murdoch,
they work as a team.

10:23.590 --> 10:25.256
So, if he's dead,
then she most certainly

10:25.325 --> 10:27.058
Has my client's money.

10:27.060 --> 10:29.894
How may I be of
assistance with this?

10:29.896 --> 10:34.866
There are constables
guarding mr. De léon and, um...

10:34.868 --> 10:37.068
And miss hobson's rooms.

10:37.203 --> 10:38.870
Could I be granted access?

10:38.872 --> 10:42.473
There may be something
in there that could, uh...

10:42.509 --> 10:43.741
Hm.

10:43.810 --> 10:46.478
Ah, be something in there
that might aid my investigation.

10:46.613 --> 10:49.080
I'm sorry, but no.

10:49.116 --> 10:53.218
There's already an ongoing
investigation, mine.

10:53.220 --> 10:54.586
Right.

10:54.721 --> 10:56.287
Higgins:
Sir?

10:56.356 --> 10:58.423
Ah, pardon the intrusion,
but I've brought some items

10:58.492 --> 11:00.224
From the crime scene you're
going to want to have a look at.

11:00.260 --> 11:01.892
Oh! May I?

11:01.928 --> 11:04.496
Mr. Quivell... No.

11:06.867 --> 11:07.766
Good day.

11:15.776 --> 11:18.376
And you thought to clutter up
my desk with evidence, did you?

11:18.511 --> 11:20.544
Well, I was told that the man
in the detective's office

11:20.580 --> 11:21.679
Was snooping
around the case.

11:21.682 --> 11:23.314
I thought it wise.

11:23.350 --> 11:24.983
Good thinking, henry.

11:25.118 --> 11:26.451
Huh. Thank you, sir.

11:26.586 --> 11:28.920
Oh, I'll see you
get a medal, higgins.

11:32.225 --> 11:34.525
Well, there's still
blood on the poker.

11:34.561 --> 11:36.795
Could be the
murder weapon.

11:36.797 --> 11:39.396
Is the pope a catholic?

11:39.433 --> 11:41.132
Where was it found?

11:41.134 --> 11:43.134
Uh, both items were found
just outside the window

11:43.269 --> 11:44.602
Of mr. De léon's room.

11:44.738 --> 11:46.137
Any fingermarks
on the poker?

11:46.173 --> 11:47.705
No, but the handkerchief
does appear

11:47.708 --> 11:49.039
To have some
initials on it.

11:51.378 --> 11:54.245
Z.H. Zinnia hobson.

11:55.816 --> 11:57.148
Murdoch:
I'm sorry, george.

11:57.184 --> 11:58.816
I don't believe it.

11:58.852 --> 12:00.485
Well, bugalugs,
it would appear

12:00.554 --> 12:02.620
That your dear old
auntie is a thief.

12:02.656 --> 12:03.821
And a murderer.

12:13.500 --> 12:16.968
I must have left my handkerchief
in juan's room last night.

12:17.103 --> 12:19.771
Miss hobson,
I happen to know that you

12:19.840 --> 12:22.907
And mr. De léon
are confidence tricksters

12:22.909 --> 12:25.043
That have been working
together for some time.

12:25.178 --> 12:27.245
I also know the two
of you recently

12:27.247 --> 12:29.380
Have come into
10,000 dollars.

12:29.416 --> 12:30.381
What?

12:30.450 --> 12:31.916
Murdoch:
Did you fight over the money?

12:32.051 --> 12:35.186
Why split 10,000 dollars
when you could have it all?

12:35.188 --> 12:37.188
You've got it all wrong!

12:37.323 --> 12:40.191
Yes, juan and I
worked together.

12:40.227 --> 12:43.394
And, yes, we may have
relieved some ladies

12:43.396 --> 12:45.730
Of their extra wealth.

12:45.865 --> 12:49.000
But not 10,000 dollars.

12:49.002 --> 12:51.803
Miss hobson, it will save us
all a lot of time

12:51.938 --> 12:56.407
If you are completely honest
with me right now.

12:56.543 --> 12:58.943
If we had 10,000 dollars

12:58.945 --> 13:01.746
We would not be
in this godforsaken town.

13:01.881 --> 13:04.282
Juan and I were in love.

13:04.284 --> 13:07.151
I had no reason
to kill him.

13:07.220 --> 13:09.420
And you just happened
to be rifling through

13:09.422 --> 13:11.356
His personal effects
at the very moment

13:11.358 --> 13:13.024
That I entered the room?

13:13.026 --> 13:14.558
I walked in.

13:14.594 --> 13:17.495
Juan was lying there dead,
and I panicked.

13:17.564 --> 13:21.365
I was trying to take anything
that would lead to me.

13:21.401 --> 13:25.703
But I swear on a stack
of bibles I am innocent.

13:25.705 --> 13:27.639
You'll forgive me if,
given what I know,

13:27.774 --> 13:29.974
I don't take your word for it.

13:34.113 --> 13:37.448
[woman groaning]

13:37.517 --> 13:39.851
Miss robinson,
how are you feeling?

13:39.986 --> 13:41.319
No better.

13:41.454 --> 13:43.654
May I examine you?

13:43.690 --> 13:45.056
You're not my doctor.

13:45.125 --> 13:46.523
Yes, but I am one.

13:46.560 --> 13:48.126
And I may be able
to help you.

13:54.334 --> 13:56.434
Oh!

13:56.503 --> 13:57.435
Oh, that hurts.

13:57.504 --> 13:59.404
Oh-oh!

13:59.539 --> 14:01.139
Oh, that hurts terrible.

14:01.274 --> 14:02.440
What are you doing?

14:02.575 --> 14:03.775
According to miss
robinson's chart,

14:03.910 --> 14:06.944
Dr. Deakins never gave her
a proper physical exam.

14:06.946 --> 14:08.012
You shouldn't
be doing this.

14:08.147 --> 14:09.614
But I am.

14:09.749 --> 14:11.416
Dr. Deakins isn't
going to like this.

14:11.551 --> 14:13.051
I'm not concerned
with what dr. Deakins

14:13.053 --> 14:14.618
Likes or doesn't like.

14:14.654 --> 14:16.420
This woman has
ovarian torsion.

14:16.456 --> 14:18.690
I can feel her
swollen ovary.

14:18.825 --> 14:20.658
The doctor said
it just hysteria.

14:20.694 --> 14:22.060
Well, he was wrong.

14:22.062 --> 14:23.561
We need to prepare
the operating theatre,

14:23.630 --> 14:25.296
This patient
needs surgery now.

14:25.431 --> 14:26.864
I could lose my job.

14:26.867 --> 14:27.932
If you're not
prepared to help me,

14:28.067 --> 14:29.033
Please find
someone who will.

14:29.168 --> 14:31.168
We're wasting time here.

14:31.204 --> 14:33.838
Will I be all right?

14:33.907 --> 14:36.240
Yes. Of course.

14:40.647 --> 14:42.513
At least consider
representing her!

14:42.549 --> 14:46.517
George, I haven't
practiced law in months.

14:46.586 --> 14:47.985
My aunt zinnia needs you.

14:48.054 --> 14:49.053
George!

14:49.188 --> 14:50.188
At least talk to her.

14:50.190 --> 14:51.389
She's a wonderful lady.

14:51.458 --> 14:54.125
I mean, does she bend
the law from time to time?

14:54.194 --> 14:55.793
Perhaps.
But she's no murderer!

14:55.795 --> 14:56.927
You need a real lawyer.

14:56.963 --> 14:58.796
You are a real lawyer.

14:58.798 --> 15:00.597
And, besides,
I trust you, effie.

15:00.634 --> 15:02.199
That's all that matters.

15:02.269 --> 15:04.268
And you know what?
Before you give up law...

15:04.271 --> 15:08.005
Perhaps the old horse
needs to be ridden again.

15:08.041 --> 15:10.341
The old, tall horse.

15:10.377 --> 15:13.811
What does her
case look like?

15:13.946 --> 15:16.948
It's... Dire.

15:16.950 --> 15:20.418
Um, the evidence against
her is piling up.

15:20.553 --> 15:21.686
But I know she's innocent.

15:21.688 --> 15:23.687
Your aunt zinnia needs more
than just your belief

15:23.723 --> 15:25.223
Of her innocence, george.

15:25.358 --> 15:26.957
Yes, exactly.

15:26.993 --> 15:28.292
She needs you.

15:34.301 --> 15:35.767
The hotel sent over
the personal items

15:35.769 --> 15:37.435
From your room.

15:37.504 --> 15:39.637
Do you need any of these
things while you're in here?

15:39.772 --> 15:41.505
You're so good
to your aunt.

15:41.574 --> 15:43.173
Oh!

15:43.209 --> 15:45.242
Juan gave this to me
just yesterday.

15:45.312 --> 15:47.778
You told the detective
he didn't have any money.

15:47.847 --> 15:49.313
And that's true.

15:49.316 --> 15:51.182
I have no idea
how he got it.

15:51.184 --> 15:52.850
Probably stole it.

15:52.852 --> 15:55.453
Ah, well, this chap
sounds like a real prize.

15:56.756 --> 15:57.721
Who are you?

15:59.526 --> 16:01.925
Miss hobson,
I am effie newsome.

16:01.962 --> 16:03.528
I will be your lawyer.

16:03.663 --> 16:05.396
A lady lawyer?

16:05.398 --> 16:07.532
Fantastic.

16:07.534 --> 16:09.500
Ah, not just your lawyer,
aunt zinnia.

16:09.536 --> 16:11.803
Effie and I have been seeing
each other for some time.

16:11.805 --> 16:13.270
Oh!

16:15.342 --> 16:17.341
Oh! Your georgie's girl.

16:17.377 --> 16:19.010
You're so pretty.

16:19.012 --> 16:21.078
Oh. Thank you, miss hobson.

16:21.147 --> 16:22.613
Zinnia.

16:22.615 --> 16:24.882
You know, we probably
shouldn't have given george

16:25.018 --> 16:27.085
All that coffee
when he was a young man.

16:27.087 --> 16:29.954
I do think
it stunted his growth.

16:29.956 --> 16:31.022
All right, now.

16:31.157 --> 16:33.624
Uh, let's get to
the matter at hand.

16:33.626 --> 16:35.526
Ah, please, sit.

16:36.863 --> 16:39.497
Now, tell me everything you can
about this 10,000 dollars.

16:40.867 --> 16:42.333
Like I've told anyone
who will listen,

16:42.468 --> 16:44.168
I know nothing
about the money.

16:44.170 --> 16:47.238
I only know that the man
I thought loved me is dead.

16:47.373 --> 16:48.773
Nothing else?

16:48.775 --> 16:49.974
And the necklace is gone.

16:50.109 --> 16:51.175
The necklace he stole?

16:51.310 --> 16:53.911
I know I told you
that juan stole the necklace.

16:54.047 --> 16:56.113
But the truth is...

16:56.149 --> 16:58.783
We both have one.

16:59.986 --> 17:03.187
We divided up the key to
our safety deposit box.

17:03.256 --> 17:06.924
That way we could take out
and put in money together.

17:06.926 --> 17:09.127
So, you two didn't
trust each other then?

17:09.129 --> 17:12.330
What we sowed together,
we reaped together.

17:12.465 --> 17:15.132
Juan wore his
half-key on a chain.

17:15.201 --> 17:17.001
When I saw him this morning,
it was gone.

17:17.136 --> 17:18.469
Who else knew
about the key?

17:18.505 --> 17:19.670
No one.

17:19.739 --> 17:21.606
Whoever is looking for
the keys to the box

17:21.741 --> 17:23.141
Is in for a big surprise.

17:23.276 --> 17:24.542
There's no money in it.

17:24.677 --> 17:26.009
All right, now,
is this the truth?

17:26.046 --> 17:27.812
Absolutely, george.

17:27.947 --> 17:30.681
I cannot believe
you don't believe me.

17:30.683 --> 17:33.951
George, could you give
us a minute, please?

17:34.020 --> 17:36.487
-What?
-I'm her counsel.

17:36.523 --> 17:38.089
Our conversations
are privileged.

17:40.827 --> 17:41.892
Yes. Of course.

17:44.297 --> 17:46.030
Now, miss hobson.

17:46.165 --> 17:47.632
Zinnia.

17:47.767 --> 17:48.999
Zinnia.

17:49.035 --> 17:51.435
I need you to tell me
the whole truth

17:51.504 --> 17:53.437
If I'm going to help you.

17:53.439 --> 17:55.773
I am telling you
the truth, dear.

17:55.908 --> 17:59.110
So, mr. De léon's half
of the key is missing.

17:59.112 --> 18:01.712
And zinnia claims that
no one else even knew

18:01.781 --> 18:03.047
About the other half
of the key.

18:03.049 --> 18:05.850
Even more evidence that
points towards her, george.

18:05.985 --> 18:08.853
Yes, sir, but to what end?

18:08.988 --> 18:12.323
I mean, aunt zinnia paints
them as love's young dream.

18:12.392 --> 18:14.057
And with no money
to fight over--

18:14.094 --> 18:16.059
That we know of.

18:16.096 --> 18:18.196
There has to be
something else.

18:18.198 --> 18:19.963
Something that
we're missing.

18:23.069 --> 18:25.068
Are the constables
still at the crime scene?

18:25.105 --> 18:26.704
We released them
this afternoon.

18:26.839 --> 18:29.140
Do you mind
if I have a look?

18:29.142 --> 18:30.141
Murdoch:
By all means.

18:31.478 --> 18:34.278
But you had best steel
yourself, george,

18:34.280 --> 18:36.414
For a possible
bad outcome.

18:36.549 --> 18:39.550
Sir, I know how it looks,
but she didn't do it.

18:39.685 --> 18:41.118
I'm sure of it.

18:49.462 --> 18:50.828
What the devil
are you doing?

18:50.897 --> 18:52.697
I'm in the middle of surgery.
Do not disturb me now.

18:52.832 --> 18:53.831
But I am the physician--

18:53.833 --> 18:55.098
Out!

18:55.135 --> 18:56.767
-This is not the last of it.
-I said now!

19:08.248 --> 19:09.847
Crabtree:
Was there anybody else

19:09.849 --> 19:11.448
Who may have seen miss hobson
enter or exit her room?

19:11.518 --> 19:12.783
-Mm-mm.
-Right.

19:12.785 --> 19:14.118
Well, thank you, anyway.

19:17.157 --> 19:19.790
Ah, miss?
That room is a crime scene.

19:19.859 --> 19:21.259
Hey! Stop!

19:21.261 --> 19:22.559
Halt right there!

19:40.780 --> 19:42.680
Toronto constabulary.

19:42.749 --> 19:43.747
You're coming with me.

19:43.783 --> 19:44.748
I didn't do anything.

19:44.817 --> 19:46.217
Well, I'll decide that.

19:48.221 --> 19:50.154
Murdoch:
Miss viola treatly,

19:50.289 --> 19:53.423
What were you doing
in juan de léon's room?

19:53.459 --> 19:55.559
When the desk clerk told me
what happened to juan,

19:55.562 --> 19:57.428
I was so upset, I...

19:57.497 --> 19:59.630
I just, I wanted
to take a memento

19:59.632 --> 20:01.132
To remember juan by.

20:01.267 --> 20:03.234
And how did
you know, uh...

20:03.369 --> 20:05.236
Juan de léon?

20:05.305 --> 20:07.505
We were in love.

20:07.640 --> 20:10.107
We were going to
go away together.

20:10.109 --> 20:11.876
You were not.
He was in love with my aunt!

20:12.011 --> 20:13.510
George, please.

20:15.514 --> 20:17.915
Where were you
early this morning?

20:17.984 --> 20:19.650
On a train coming back
from visiting my sister

20:19.686 --> 20:21.118
In peterborough.

20:21.154 --> 20:22.787
I see.

20:22.922 --> 20:27.058
And were you aware
of what mr. De léon

20:27.060 --> 20:30.194
Did for a living?

20:30.196 --> 20:31.862
There's no
point in lying.

20:31.864 --> 20:33.797
Yes, I did.

20:33.833 --> 20:36.267
And I knew who he was
partners with, as well.

20:36.402 --> 20:39.069
Zinnia hobson.

20:41.374 --> 20:43.140
What did you
know about her?

20:43.209 --> 20:45.075
Just that she was
a lying thief.

20:45.144 --> 20:47.344
Ah, pot calling
the kettle black, if you ask me.

20:47.413 --> 20:48.679
George.

20:51.317 --> 20:54.318
Zinnia must have found
out about juan and I.

20:56.622 --> 20:58.622
And she must have found out
about the 10,000 dollars

20:58.691 --> 21:00.091
That he had.

21:00.093 --> 21:02.626
You knew about
this sum of money?

21:02.662 --> 21:04.561
He got it two weeks ago.

21:04.597 --> 21:07.264
He told me zinnia didn't
know anything about it.

21:08.301 --> 21:10.367
He was double-crossing her?

21:10.503 --> 21:12.436
Well, he was
keeping it for us.

21:12.472 --> 21:14.571
So that we could
run away together.

21:14.641 --> 21:17.574
Zinnia must have
found out somehow.

21:17.710 --> 21:19.176
She did this to juan.

21:19.312 --> 21:21.578
I just know that she did!

21:31.390 --> 21:32.923
Georgie, no.

21:32.959 --> 21:35.792
That, that can't be true.

21:35.828 --> 21:39.329
Zinnie, viola treatly has
just told the detective and I

21:39.365 --> 21:42.533
All about her love
affair with mr. De léon.

21:42.535 --> 21:44.668
Well, then,
to heck with him.

21:44.704 --> 21:46.937
I suppose he didn't
care about me,

21:47.006 --> 21:49.139
So I don't care about him.

21:49.175 --> 21:51.275
More importantly,
miss hobson,

21:51.344 --> 21:53.477
You have lied to us
at every turn.

21:53.546 --> 21:57.748
If I were you,
now would be the time

21:57.784 --> 21:59.950
To avail yourself
of the truth.

21:59.986 --> 22:02.619
What is in it for my client
if she cooperates?

22:02.689 --> 22:04.187
It may spare
her the noose.

22:04.223 --> 22:05.289
Sir.

22:05.424 --> 22:07.158
The charge is
murder, george.

22:07.293 --> 22:10.027
All right.
You want the truth?

22:10.162 --> 22:13.097
We were going to take
a pigeon for 10,000 dollars

22:13.166 --> 22:14.631
But it didn't pan out.

22:14.701 --> 22:16.199
Aunt zinnia.

22:16.235 --> 22:18.101
Zinnia: Or, at least,
I thought it didn't pan out.

22:18.137 --> 22:20.104
Apparently,
juan lied to me.

22:20.106 --> 22:23.340
But I did not kill him,
I swear.

22:24.544 --> 22:26.377
I loved him.

22:27.313 --> 22:29.346
And he did not
love me back.

22:33.920 --> 22:35.318
Who was the pigeon?

22:37.657 --> 22:39.289
It might be best
that you answer.

22:40.793 --> 22:43.394
Leniency for
cooperation, detective?

22:44.464 --> 22:45.429
What do you say?

22:48.467 --> 22:51.869
May I offer you a long,
cool drink, detective?

22:51.938 --> 22:54.004
Uh, thank you.

22:54.006 --> 22:56.941
We understand
a mr. Juan de léon

22:57.076 --> 22:59.810
Cheated you out of
a substantial sum of money?

22:59.879 --> 23:02.179
It is a bit embarrassing.

23:02.248 --> 23:04.615
I'm sure mr. De léon
was very convincing.

23:04.684 --> 23:06.317
Oh, yes.

23:06.452 --> 23:10.421
He told me he was a scion of
a very wealthy spanish family.

23:10.556 --> 23:12.690
He was involved in building
a children's hospital

23:12.825 --> 23:14.425
Outside of barcelona,

23:14.427 --> 23:16.894
But his family lost
all their money

23:16.896 --> 23:19.864
In that anarchist
uprising last month.

23:19.999 --> 23:23.366
Oh, I know how
foolish it sounds now.

23:23.503 --> 23:27.604
But he was so convincing.

23:28.975 --> 23:31.041
What happened after
you gave him the money?

23:31.043 --> 23:34.044
That was the last
I ever heard of him.

23:34.046 --> 23:36.713
You never contacted
the police.

23:36.749 --> 23:41.385
I wanted to save my
children the embarrassment.

23:41.454 --> 23:44.889
Myself, as well,
truth be told.

23:45.024 --> 23:47.925
So, instead,
you hired mr. Quivell?

23:47.927 --> 23:48.959
Who?

23:49.094 --> 23:50.428
The private investigator.

23:50.563 --> 23:52.796
I didn't hire
a private investigator.

23:54.167 --> 23:57.334
Did you know mr. De léon was
staying at the brearly hotel?

23:57.470 --> 24:01.137
No, dear.
I don't know where he is.

24:01.174 --> 24:04.442
He could be halfway
to timbuktu by now.

24:08.280 --> 24:11.282
Mrs. Mccall,
can you explain why

24:11.417 --> 24:15.018
You are painting a portrait
of anthony quivell?

24:15.087 --> 24:19.356
Him?
Why, that's my son, owen.

24:22.328 --> 24:23.293
Ogden:
Thank you.

24:23.329 --> 24:25.829
Deakins:
Dr. Ogden. Dr. Ogden!

24:25.898 --> 24:28.064
Dr. Deakins.

24:29.835 --> 24:31.235
You had no right to --

24:31.237 --> 24:33.103
You'll be pleased to know that
your patient is doing very well.

24:33.105 --> 24:35.639
Despite your
irresponsible diagnosis.

24:35.708 --> 24:36.907
Now, wait just one moment.

24:36.943 --> 24:38.442
A diagnosis that,
if left long enough,

24:38.444 --> 24:39.977
Could have killed her!

24:39.979 --> 24:43.380
Do you demand praise for
correcting me, dr. Ogden?

24:43.449 --> 24:44.915
That smacks of vanity.

24:44.984 --> 24:47.117
This isn't about me,
dr. Deakins.

24:47.186 --> 24:50.320
You didn't even bother to give
her a physical examination.

24:50.356 --> 24:52.256
I believed my
diagnosis was correct

24:52.258 --> 24:53.990
Based on
what she told me.

24:54.026 --> 24:56.192
You considered her a weak,
hysterical female

24:56.229 --> 24:58.595
And that's why you didn't
diagnose her properly!

24:58.731 --> 25:01.065
You are impugning my
reputation as a doctor,

25:01.200 --> 25:03.567
And I warn you,
it won't end well.

25:03.702 --> 25:05.502
For whom, dr. Deakins?

25:11.811 --> 25:14.011
George! Detective.

25:14.013 --> 25:15.679
Effie, interesting
development.

25:15.814 --> 25:17.514
It turns out anthony quivell

25:17.517 --> 25:19.883
Is not anthony quivell,
private investigator,

25:19.886 --> 25:23.554
But rather owen mccall,
mrs. Mccall's son.

25:23.623 --> 25:25.489
Effie:
Really?

25:25.624 --> 25:27.358
Um, I think he's the one
who might have killed

25:27.360 --> 25:29.159
Mr. De léon
for the 10,000 dollars.

25:29.228 --> 25:31.695
A sum my client maintains
she knows nothing about.

25:31.697 --> 25:32.930
So she says.

25:32.999 --> 25:34.064
Well, sir,
she said she didn't.

25:34.199 --> 25:36.500
-I might have something.
-What's that?

25:36.502 --> 25:39.236
This same private investigator
came to my office today.

25:39.305 --> 25:40.571
He wanted to
speak to my client.

25:40.706 --> 25:41.838
My aunt.

25:41.908 --> 25:43.173
Yes, george, we're aware.

25:43.175 --> 25:45.175
-I refused, of course.
-What did he want with her?

25:45.311 --> 25:47.711
Well, I don't know.
I terminated the conversation.

25:47.713 --> 25:51.782
If he found half of
the safety deposit key

25:51.784 --> 25:53.717
That was around
mr. De léon's neck,

25:53.719 --> 25:55.986
Then perhaps he's
seeking its companion.

25:56.121 --> 25:58.789
Let him have this key?

25:58.858 --> 26:00.090
Are you crazy?

26:00.225 --> 26:01.424
Effie:
Listen to the detective.

26:01.460 --> 26:02.860
Zinnie.

26:02.862 --> 26:06.130
If you cooperate,
I may be willing to look past

26:06.132 --> 26:08.798
Your involvement in
defrauding mrs. Mccall.

26:08.834 --> 26:10.601
Just that one?

26:10.736 --> 26:12.269
Don't push me.

26:12.338 --> 26:14.371
What do you need me to do?

26:14.506 --> 26:17.474
We let mr. Mccall
steal your key.

26:17.476 --> 26:20.477
If he tries to access
your safety deposit box,

26:20.546 --> 26:23.213
We'll know that he
killed mr. De léon.

26:23.282 --> 26:24.682
Why not just
give him the key?

26:24.684 --> 26:27.150
Because he would then know
that we're on to him.

26:27.219 --> 26:30.220
Now, please ask mr. Mccall,
aka anthony quivell,

26:30.256 --> 26:31.755
To come to
the station house.

26:31.890 --> 26:33.123
Sir.

26:33.159 --> 26:35.726
You do have a little larceny
in your heart, detective.

26:35.861 --> 26:37.828
Only when called for.

26:37.897 --> 26:40.764
Now, we just need him
to steal that key.

26:40.899 --> 26:42.232
How do we do that?

26:42.268 --> 26:45.235
Oh, come now, miss hobson,
don't disappoint me.

26:45.271 --> 26:48.038
I thought you were an
accomplished con...

26:48.107 --> 26:49.440
Woman.

26:49.575 --> 26:50.774
All right.

26:50.776 --> 26:52.909
But we're going to
need some extra players

26:52.911 --> 26:55.612
To complete the charade.

26:57.149 --> 26:58.748
Gentlemen!

27:04.957 --> 27:06.122
Forbes:
I suppose you know why

27:06.158 --> 27:07.724
I called you in
here today, dr. Ogden?

27:07.860 --> 27:09.393
Yes, I believe
I have an idea.

27:09.528 --> 27:11.728
You went against
a fellow doctor's diagnosis,

27:11.764 --> 27:13.130
Then you made him
look like a fool

27:13.132 --> 27:15.532
In the hospital corridors,
for everyone to see.

27:15.568 --> 27:18.135
I saved that woman
from grave illness.

27:18.270 --> 27:19.670
Be that as it may,

27:19.805 --> 27:21.871
I'm afraid there's
more at stake here.

27:21.873 --> 27:25.409
Dr. Deakins' misdiagnosis
almost cost a woman her life!

27:25.544 --> 27:27.411
If doctors are to
publicly question

27:27.546 --> 27:30.013
Fellow doctors' judgement,
where will we be?

27:32.551 --> 27:34.284
Forgive me, dr. Forbes,
but it sounds as though

27:34.353 --> 27:36.020
You're putting one
doctor's self-esteem

27:36.155 --> 27:38.121
Above the health
of a patient.

27:40.959 --> 27:43.393
You are unprofessional
and disruptive.

27:43.462 --> 27:45.562
And certainly not
the first time.

27:45.698 --> 27:49.566
I must ask you to apologize
to dr. Deakins immediately.

27:49.701 --> 27:51.435
I must apologize to him?

27:51.570 --> 27:54.504
Yes. At once.
Good day, doctor.

28:04.150 --> 28:08.251
Mr. Quivell, I wanted to
update you on our investigation,

28:08.287 --> 28:11.321
As a professional courtesy.

28:11.323 --> 28:13.924
I appreciate that.

28:13.926 --> 28:16.126
Has some new evidence
come to light

28:16.261 --> 28:17.994
With regard
to miss zinnia hobson?

28:18.064 --> 28:19.596
Well, no.

28:19.598 --> 28:22.266
We now believe the person
who murdered juan de léon

28:22.401 --> 28:26.470
Was motivated not by money,
but jealous revenge.

28:26.472 --> 28:28.872
Interesting.

28:29.007 --> 28:33.310
You see, miss hobson had
another partner in...

28:33.445 --> 28:36.613
Partner in crime
before juan de léon.

28:36.649 --> 28:39.883
A mr. Hugh st. Clair.

28:39.885 --> 28:43.019
And what is his
part in all this?

28:43.055 --> 28:44.621
We believe that mr. St. Clair

28:44.690 --> 28:47.624
Also has the money
that you are after,

28:47.626 --> 28:49.692
On behalf of your
client, of course.

28:51.430 --> 28:54.631
Zinnia:
I am free as a bird.

28:54.767 --> 28:56.966
You won't be seeing me
again, constable.

28:57.002 --> 28:59.236
Now, where are my things?

28:59.238 --> 29:01.371
You're releasing
zinnia hobson?

29:01.440 --> 29:03.640
Yes and no.

29:03.776 --> 29:06.577
You see, we believe
that mr. St. Clair

29:06.579 --> 29:09.446
Will try to contact
zinnia hobson.

29:09.515 --> 29:11.714
He's been very
elusive thus far.

29:11.751 --> 29:14.117
We are going to
follow miss hobson

29:14.186 --> 29:16.586
And when the two
finally connect,

29:16.622 --> 29:18.254
We'll nab him.

29:19.925 --> 29:21.725
And what do we know about
this st. Clair fellow?

29:24.129 --> 29:25.528
He's known to us.

29:25.530 --> 29:27.864
Keep an eye out
for this man.

29:36.342 --> 29:37.808
Sir, is this
quite necessary?

29:37.943 --> 29:40.877
I give you my word aunt zinnia
will not try to escape.

29:41.013 --> 29:42.078
Well, thank you, george.

29:42.148 --> 29:43.680
And as much as I
appreciate your word,

29:43.749 --> 29:45.949
I don't quite trust
your aunt's yet.

29:45.985 --> 29:49.553
You know, a lesser woman
than I would take offense.

29:49.555 --> 29:51.788
What is that?

29:51.824 --> 29:55.025
I've been working on reducing
the size of my tracking device.

29:55.094 --> 29:56.827
All I require now is this.

29:56.829 --> 30:01.531
And a receiver

30:01.534 --> 30:04.768
To emit a sound

30:04.903 --> 30:07.337
When in proximity
to the device.

30:07.406 --> 30:09.239
You mean,
I'm supposed to wear this?

30:09.308 --> 30:10.607
On your ankle.

30:10.609 --> 30:12.775
It's very discreet,
I assure you.

30:14.380 --> 30:15.712
Will you help me
try it on?

30:15.748 --> 30:18.047
I'm sure george can
help you with that.

30:18.083 --> 30:19.516
Right.

30:19.651 --> 30:21.318
Brearly hotel. Tonight.

30:21.453 --> 30:22.819
Right.

30:25.791 --> 30:29.860
Your detective:
He's quite something.

30:29.862 --> 30:31.194
He is, indeed.

30:31.263 --> 30:34.131
I'm quite fortunate to have
learned under his tutelage.

30:34.266 --> 30:36.733
Wasn't talking about
his level of education.

30:36.769 --> 30:38.335
Is he married?

30:38.404 --> 30:39.536
Yes!

30:39.605 --> 30:41.605
Happily,
unfortunately for you.

30:41.607 --> 30:44.007
Well, that's a pity.

30:46.345 --> 30:49.613
George, I'm sorry I've
turned your life upside down.

30:49.615 --> 30:52.815
Well, you wouldn't be my
aunt zinnia if you hadn't.

30:55.020 --> 30:56.586
All right. Give us a leg.

30:56.622 --> 30:58.021
Okay.

31:02.294 --> 31:04.428
Dr. Deakins,
may I have a word?

31:04.563 --> 31:05.862
Of course.

31:09.268 --> 31:11.234
I gather you've
spoken with dr. Forbes.

31:11.237 --> 31:12.435
Yes.

31:12.504 --> 31:14.771
It's unfortunate that you
chose to speak with him

31:14.773 --> 31:16.373
About our conversation.

31:16.508 --> 31:17.707
That wasn't
a conversation.

31:17.743 --> 31:19.576
That was you hysterically
overreacting.

31:19.711 --> 31:21.044
[laughs]

31:21.113 --> 31:22.913
Do you believe
that all women

31:22.915 --> 31:25.315
Who dare disagree
with you are hysterical?

31:25.351 --> 31:27.283
I thought this was
meant to be an apology.

31:30.289 --> 31:31.788
I know that it
was wrong to speak to you

31:31.857 --> 31:32.856
The way that I did and--

31:32.991 --> 31:34.291
You did more than that.

31:34.360 --> 31:36.025
You operated on my patient
without my permission.

31:38.197 --> 31:41.264
You left without doing
a proper physical examination.

31:41.267 --> 31:43.066
Where's my apology?

31:43.068 --> 31:46.803
One is not being offered,
dr. Deakins.

31:46.805 --> 31:48.938
I cannot, in good conscience,
apologize to you

31:48.974 --> 31:50.874
When you're so clearly
in the wrong!

31:51.009 --> 31:52.542
Once again, dr. Ogden,

31:52.544 --> 31:54.344
Your emotions
get the better of you.

32:15.501 --> 32:16.967
Crabtree:
What on earth?

32:17.102 --> 32:19.202
Sir, that's him.
He's right there.

32:29.949 --> 32:32.115
Ah, sir, what will
you have to drink?

32:32.117 --> 32:33.684
Now is hardly
the time, george.

32:33.819 --> 32:35.652
To look less suspicious.

32:35.787 --> 32:37.787
Ah, two spruce
beers, please.

32:37.823 --> 32:39.589
Crabtree:
Spruce beer.

32:39.725 --> 32:41.924
It's an acquired taste,
I suppose.

32:41.961 --> 32:43.260
Mm-hm.

32:43.395 --> 32:47.897
Zinnia! Zinnia.
Zinnia! Zinnia! Zinnia!

32:49.902 --> 32:52.135
Hugh!
You've got some nerve.

32:52.270 --> 32:54.537
Brackenreid:
I just want to parlay.

32:54.539 --> 32:57.073
May I have a seat,
honeysuckle?

32:57.075 --> 32:59.942
You look as ravishing
as ever, darling!

32:59.979 --> 33:02.279
You don't fool me
with your sweet talk.

33:02.414 --> 33:05.081
I know you're mad
with jealousy over juan.

33:05.217 --> 33:07.551
Juan?
[spits]

33:07.553 --> 33:11.755
I'm the only suitor for you
and you damn well know it!

33:11.757 --> 33:13.623
Please forgive me, darling.

33:13.692 --> 33:15.025
Please!

33:15.094 --> 33:17.327
That's for juan!

33:17.329 --> 33:18.829
That's for me!

33:18.831 --> 33:22.132
Bloody hell! Ah, zinnia!
Zinnia, don't go, darling!

33:22.134 --> 33:23.433
Honeysuckle, I love you.

33:23.469 --> 33:24.901
Murdoch:
Hugh st. Clair!

33:25.037 --> 33:26.369
Toronto constabulary.

33:26.372 --> 33:28.238
You are under arrest
for the murder of juan de léon.

33:28.373 --> 33:30.239
Brackenreid:
I haven't killed anyone!

33:30.275 --> 33:31.875
Now unhand me,
you bounder.

33:32.010 --> 33:33.309
You are coming with us.

33:35.714 --> 33:37.980
No! You can't do this!

33:38.017 --> 33:39.916
Make up your mind, woman!

33:39.918 --> 33:41.018
I've already lost juan.

33:41.153 --> 33:42.652
[spits]

33:42.654 --> 33:44.320
And now I'll lose hugh.

33:44.356 --> 33:46.256
Let him go, sir.

33:46.258 --> 33:47.390
If you continue to protest,

33:47.393 --> 33:49.326
I'll be forced to
arrest you, as well.

33:49.328 --> 33:51.061
Oh! Well, then.

33:51.063 --> 33:52.195
Carry on.

33:52.231 --> 33:53.663
He's gone.

33:53.665 --> 33:55.198
-Did he take the bait?
-He did, indeed.

33:55.234 --> 33:56.332
Should I follow him?

33:56.368 --> 33:58.701
No, no, no. We know
precisely where he will be.

33:58.771 --> 34:01.271
Please escort your aunt
back to the station house.

34:01.340 --> 34:02.939
I'm not free to go?

34:02.941 --> 34:04.974
Let's see how this
plays out tomorrow.

34:05.010 --> 34:06.009
Right.

34:06.011 --> 34:07.744
Inspector, that was, ah...

34:07.813 --> 34:09.212
Something else.

34:12.584 --> 34:15.218
It's been a while since
I trod the boards, murdoch.

34:15.287 --> 34:18.421
"if music be the food
of love, play on!"

34:18.457 --> 34:22.959
One doesn't forget one's
first love, murdoch, does one?

34:22.961 --> 34:24.627
Yes, sir.

34:24.696 --> 34:27.697
You certainly mustered
every ounce of talent you have

34:27.833 --> 34:30.700
To pull off such
a convincing lothario.

34:30.736 --> 34:32.068
Thank you, murdoch.

34:34.106 --> 34:35.538
Hang on a sec!

34:44.049 --> 34:46.783
Good morning.
How may I help you?

34:46.918 --> 34:48.318
Good morning.

34:48.453 --> 34:51.454
I was hoping to open
a savings account.

34:51.456 --> 34:53.789
A savings account?

34:53.826 --> 34:55.192
Yes.

34:55.194 --> 34:59.396
And, to that end,
here is five dollars

34:59.531 --> 35:02.031
For my initial deposit.

35:03.202 --> 35:05.268
I see. Nothing more?

35:05.403 --> 35:07.837
Ah, no.
Please just honour my wishes.

35:07.906 --> 35:09.406
Yes. Of course.

35:09.408 --> 35:11.541
Uh, let me just
find the paperwork.

35:13.178 --> 35:14.744
Take your time.

35:14.746 --> 35:17.347
Watts: You're sure that's
all I can help you with?

35:17.349 --> 35:20.116
See, that's the thing
with you bank fellows.

35:20.119 --> 35:21.952
Man walks in for one thing,

35:22.087 --> 35:23.486
And you try
and sell him another.

35:23.555 --> 35:25.155
A bloody savings account?

35:25.224 --> 35:26.623
Wasn't he supposed to go

35:26.625 --> 35:28.091
Straight to a safety
deposit box?

35:28.160 --> 35:29.492
That was the idea.

35:29.561 --> 35:30.960
I'm calling watts.

35:32.631 --> 35:34.997
[phone rings]

35:41.173 --> 35:42.239
Hello?

35:42.374 --> 35:44.173
What the bloody hell
is he playing at?

35:44.175 --> 35:47.577
I'm afraid I don't
have an answer for that.

35:49.314 --> 35:50.580
He's on to us.

35:50.616 --> 35:52.716
He must have given
the key to someone else.

35:52.851 --> 35:56.052
Detective, go to
the safety deposit room now!

35:56.054 --> 35:59.189
Could you excuse me
for just a moment?

35:59.191 --> 36:01.658
Yeah. I, uh, I'm trying
to do business here!

36:01.727 --> 36:03.726
I'll be,
I'll be right back.

36:13.738 --> 36:15.471
The deposit box
has been opened.

36:19.678 --> 36:20.877
The bugger's still
standing there.

36:21.012 --> 36:22.078
He hasn't moved an inch.

36:22.114 --> 36:23.947
He has to be working
with someone else.

36:23.949 --> 36:25.281
Well, they can't
have gotten far.

36:25.350 --> 36:27.683
You two go and have a gander.
I'll keep an eye on quivell.

36:27.719 --> 36:29.819
Wait! Shouldn't I
open a savings...

36:29.821 --> 36:30.853
Watts!

36:32.257 --> 36:35.959
George, when I get out of jail,
I'm going to be a new woman,

36:35.961 --> 36:38.894
On the straight
and narrow.

36:38.931 --> 36:40.096
Aunt zinnia.

36:40.232 --> 36:41.831
No, no. I mean it.

36:41.833 --> 36:43.933
All my aunts walked
a crooked path.

36:44.002 --> 36:45.468
Why should you
be any different?

36:48.574 --> 36:50.440
Oh, georgie.

36:50.509 --> 36:52.642
Don't hate me for that.

36:52.678 --> 36:54.110
Not at all.

36:54.179 --> 36:57.113
I prefer
interesting relations.

36:57.182 --> 37:00.850
Although I should
return you to the cells.

37:00.886 --> 37:03.687
Could I use the lavatory?

37:03.822 --> 37:05.421
Well, there's
a bucket in the--

37:06.825 --> 37:08.357
Ah, yes, of course.

37:10.395 --> 37:11.795
Oh, aunt zinnie?

37:11.930 --> 37:14.464
I don't suppose I would have
liked mr. De léon very much,

37:14.466 --> 37:18.935
But I gather you did
and I'm sorry you lost him.

37:18.937 --> 37:20.303
Don't worry, georgie.

37:20.305 --> 37:22.471
I'll find another.

37:37.789 --> 37:39.555
Oh, juan.

37:39.625 --> 37:42.225
I knew you
wouldn't forsake me.

38:04.449 --> 38:06.316
I haven't seen a soul
who was inside the bank

38:06.318 --> 38:07.784
While I was there.

38:09.454 --> 38:10.586
Sir?

38:10.622 --> 38:12.388
Quivell's still in there
filling out bloody forms.

38:12.424 --> 38:13.956
-It's curious.
-Hardly!

38:14.026 --> 38:15.391
You ever been to
a bank, murdoch?

38:15.427 --> 38:17.527
All the forms and the bollocks
you have to fill out?

38:17.596 --> 38:19.462
That's why I keep
my cash in my pockets

38:19.498 --> 38:20.997
And my silver
in the floorboards.

38:21.132 --> 38:22.065
Very good.

38:22.200 --> 38:23.800
That's not what
I was referring to.

38:23.802 --> 38:25.201
The carriage.

38:25.237 --> 38:26.269
What about it?

38:26.404 --> 38:27.937
That's the third time
it's gone past

38:28.073 --> 38:30.073
While I've been
standing here.

38:30.142 --> 38:32.342
Quivell's accomplice.
Waiting for him to leave?

38:32.477 --> 38:34.677
He's on his way out.

38:34.680 --> 38:35.812
Sir, you'd best hide.

38:35.881 --> 38:37.213
Quivell knows you
as mr. St. Clair.

38:39.918 --> 38:40.850
What the devil?

38:40.985 --> 38:43.052
Open the door! Hurry!

38:45.557 --> 38:48.424
Stop! Whoa! Whoa!

38:48.460 --> 38:50.126
Toronto constabulary.

38:50.195 --> 38:52.395
Your two passengers
are coming with us, sir.

39:07.979 --> 39:09.345
Aunt zinnia?

39:11.383 --> 39:12.581
Zinnie?

39:23.528 --> 39:24.527
Zinnie.

39:24.596 --> 39:26.429
Treatly:
I didn't do anything!

39:26.565 --> 39:27.997
Murdoch:
That's what they all say.

39:28.033 --> 39:29.799
Constable, please
escort miss treatly

39:29.934 --> 39:31.300
And mr. Mccall to the cells.

39:31.370 --> 39:32.535
Right away, sir.

39:35.107 --> 39:36.406
Sir.

39:36.408 --> 39:37.540
Brackenreid:
So, crabtree, where's your aunt?

39:37.576 --> 39:38.808
Sir?

39:38.943 --> 39:40.343
Well, she'll be pleased to hear
that we've caught those two.

39:40.412 --> 39:43.212
Yes. No, she's
just in the... Um...

39:43.281 --> 39:45.815
Having a rest and I was
about to fetch her.

39:45.817 --> 39:47.550
Even money says
she's scarpered.

39:47.685 --> 39:49.219
Watts:
No! I don't bet.

39:49.221 --> 39:50.686
-It's hardly a wager, watts.
-No, no, no.

39:50.688 --> 39:52.088
-I'm just saying!
-I don't bet.

40:07.506 --> 40:10.506
[beeping sound]

40:19.217 --> 40:23.186
[beeping intensifies]

40:23.188 --> 40:25.554
Oh, for pete's sake.

40:41.807 --> 40:42.972
Oh, zinnie.

40:44.342 --> 40:46.542
Our private investigator
has confessed to the murder

40:46.611 --> 40:48.077
Of mr. De léon.

40:48.079 --> 40:50.746
I suppose he made the phone
call from the hotel?

40:50.782 --> 40:52.749
He used his paramour,
miss treatly,

40:52.884 --> 40:54.617
As mr. De léon's lover.

40:54.619 --> 40:56.753
To murder a man
over some money.

40:56.888 --> 40:58.354
Hardly seems worth it.

40:58.490 --> 41:00.422
It was more than that,
watts.

41:00.459 --> 41:02.492
The man humiliated
his mother.

41:02.494 --> 41:05.495
Huh. Just some bruised pride.
She'll live.

41:05.630 --> 41:07.029
Bloody hell, watts!

41:07.098 --> 41:08.931
A simple observation.

41:11.036 --> 41:13.369
So, crabtree!
Where's your auntie?

41:15.507 --> 41:18.374
Ah, sir, that's
a good question.

41:18.443 --> 41:20.710
Uh, an excellent
question, in fact.

41:20.712 --> 41:21.711
Flew the coop, did she?

41:21.846 --> 41:24.313
Yes. I'm afraid so.

41:24.349 --> 41:26.182
Crabtree:
Ah! I knew it was a sure thing.

41:34.426 --> 41:36.458
I asked you to apologize
to dr. Deakins.

41:36.495 --> 41:37.860
You failed to do that.

41:37.929 --> 41:39.529
Yes, I suppose I did.

41:39.531 --> 41:42.599
But, dr. Forbes,
this issue is far greater

41:42.734 --> 41:44.667
Than one incident
with dr. Deakins.

41:44.669 --> 41:46.903
I have seen a pattern
of disregard

41:46.972 --> 41:49.005
For female patients
in this hospital.

41:49.140 --> 41:50.507
Oh, have you?

41:50.642 --> 41:53.476
Yes, and you can no longer
turn a blind eye to it.

41:53.611 --> 41:55.645
This neglect is harmful.

41:55.714 --> 41:59.214
My job is to support
the doctors in this hospital,

41:59.251 --> 42:02.418
Whose professional opinion
I trust wholeheartedly.

42:02.553 --> 42:05.755
Well, I can give you
several examples of times

42:05.757 --> 42:08.090
When those professional
opinions were wrong.

42:11.429 --> 42:14.564
Dr. Ogden, I have grown tired
of your continuous crusades.

42:14.699 --> 42:16.432
My crusades?

42:16.468 --> 42:18.601
Nothing is good enough,
you're always angry

42:18.736 --> 42:21.570
And you find oppression
where there is none.

42:21.572 --> 42:22.938
We've been here before,

42:22.974 --> 42:23.973
And I can see
we'll be here again

42:24.108 --> 42:25.842
Unless I put
a stop to it.

42:25.844 --> 42:27.377
What are you saying?

42:27.512 --> 42:30.113
Dr. Ogden, you are dismissed
from this hospital.

42:30.248 --> 42:32.915
You have no right.

42:32.918 --> 42:34.717
This is my hospital

42:34.852 --> 42:37.219
And I have the full
support of the board.

42:43.461 --> 42:44.426
This is not over.

42:47.566 --> 42:49.132
Crabtree: So, your first
case back as a lawyer

42:49.134 --> 42:50.199
Was a short one.

42:50.201 --> 42:52.468
Effie: True. I didn't
even get to go to court.

42:52.604 --> 42:56.406
But, I have to say, being
busy and useful was a tonic.

42:56.541 --> 42:59.075
Well, at least something good
came of my aunt's trickery.

42:59.144 --> 43:02.144
I hope you don't feel too
hurt by her actions, george.

43:02.180 --> 43:04.213
They're not a reflection
of her love for you.

43:04.249 --> 43:06.281
She left me this.

43:06.318 --> 43:07.617
What is it?

43:09.287 --> 43:10.486
She says she apologizes

43:10.622 --> 43:11.821
And even though she's
not going to jail,

43:11.823 --> 43:14.690
She's going to live
a lawful life from now on.

43:14.826 --> 43:16.492
And do you believe her?

43:16.628 --> 43:18.962
I'd like to.

43:19.097 --> 43:20.763
What would you like to do?

43:20.765 --> 43:22.231
I'm starving.

43:22.267 --> 43:23.633
All right, then.

43:23.768 --> 43:25.701
Well, let's get
some dinner.

43:25.770 --> 43:28.103
Not for food, george.
