Greg Pikitis.

00:17.324 --> 00:20.569
- You're the parks lady, right?
- That's right. I'm the parks lady.

00:21.896 --> 00:25.075
And I'm here to tell you
that this year, it ends.

00:25.375 --> 00:26.869
This kid makes me crazy.

00:27.084 --> 00:28.994
We got a history, Greg and I.

00:29.396 --> 00:31.890
He absolutely terrorizes
the park system.

00:32.549 --> 00:34.921
Every halloween
someone defaces the statue

00:35.046 --> 00:37.105
of mayor Percy in Ramsett park.

00:37.371 --> 00:40.873
And I know it's Greg Pikitis,
but I've never been able to prove it.

00:41.250 --> 00:43.762
He's like an invisible,
adolescent James Bond

00:43.887 --> 00:46.170
super-villain criminal mastermind.

00:48.198 --> 00:51.175
Or maybe someone else is doing it.
But I really feel like it's this kid.

00:51.343 --> 00:53.623
Got the entire parks department
watching you,

00:53.748 --> 00:55.104
my boyfriend's a cop.

00:55.493 --> 00:56.849
So don't even try it.

00:57.553 --> 00:59.813
- I don't understand.
- I think you do.

01:00.299 --> 01:01.435
It ends today.

01:01.982 --> 01:02.982
It ends...

01:03.542 --> 01:04.542
to...

01:05.467 --> 01:06.273
day.

01:09.550 --> 01:11.362
Thanks for stopping by.
You look great.

01:12.154 --> 01:13.154
Thank you.

01:13.735 --> 01:14.785
Ends today.

01:36.367 --> 01:37.596
Hey, parks department.

01:38.249 --> 01:39.299
Ann's here.

01:40.610 --> 01:42.168
Just to remind you...

01:42.293 --> 01:45.246
Tonight, 7:00, my house,
in costume.

01:45.371 --> 01:46.564
Everybody in?

01:50.193 --> 01:52.402
Halloween is my favorite holiday.

01:52.527 --> 01:55.398
It's just the best.
And I don't have to work.

01:55.523 --> 01:58.392
Hey, slutty teenage girls
dressed as sexy kittens,

01:58.517 --> 02:00.711
pump your own stomachs this year.

02:01.413 --> 02:02.288
One thing.

02:02.562 --> 02:05.303
The people in this room now
are the people I invited.

02:05.428 --> 02:08.310
Plus Leslie and Donna,
so don't tell anybody.

02:08.435 --> 02:11.498
- Who's not invited, then?
- What's going on, cupcake?

02:11.623 --> 02:13.632
Excited about the party tonight.

02:15.192 --> 02:17.803
You're coming.
I was just about to tell you.

02:18.363 --> 02:19.963
Jerry already told me.

02:20.358 --> 02:23.219
Can't wait to see
how tiny your costume is.

02:24.456 --> 02:26.356
- What time does it start?
- 7:00.

02:26.696 --> 02:27.605
Perfect.

02:27.879 --> 02:29.329
Yeah, it's perfect.

02:30.317 --> 02:33.027
Check this out.
These are all the possible routes

02:33.301 --> 02:36.204
from Greg Pikitis' house
to the statue.

02:37.037 --> 02:40.326
That looks like something you would find
on the wall of a serial killer.

02:40.638 --> 02:42.510
In a way that's a compliment.

02:42.635 --> 02:43.985
Shows dedication.

02:44.507 --> 02:47.869
What's the big deal anyway?
I mean, a kid TPs some statue.

02:48.464 --> 02:50.248
And all the trees
and all the benches.

02:50.373 --> 02:52.743
It takes us, like, ten days
to clean his mess up.

02:52.868 --> 02:55.966
But more importantly, Pikitis sucks,
and I want to destroy him.

02:58.237 --> 03:00.451
If you destroy him early,
please come by.

03:00.576 --> 03:01.488
I will.

03:03.558 --> 03:05.836
How is someone gonna be able
to get through that door?

03:07.052 --> 03:08.102
What the...

03:08.406 --> 03:09.897
Are you kidding me?

03:10.065 --> 03:12.191
Jerry, relax. Here.

03:13.019 --> 03:14.068
William Percy.

03:14.634 --> 03:17.205
One of Pawnee's greatest mayors,
and a true hero.

03:17.330 --> 03:20.261
During the Pawnee bread factory
fire of 1922,

03:20.386 --> 03:22.451
he ran back into a burning building

03:22.619 --> 03:25.245
and saved the beloved secret recipe
for Pawnee pumpernickel.

03:26.068 --> 03:27.706
Didn't 30 people die in that fire?

03:28.860 --> 03:30.310
He wasn't superman.

03:30.808 --> 03:33.901
He looks like Ron Swanson.
Is that who this is based on?

03:34.026 --> 03:35.714
No, it's based on William Percy.

03:36.174 --> 03:37.678
Were you listening?

03:39.544 --> 03:40.874
Okay, Andy. Good news.

03:40.999 --> 03:43.191
You're officially
on the parks department payroll.

03:43.316 --> 03:44.338
$8 an hour.

03:45.350 --> 03:46.850
Commit this to memory.

03:47.150 --> 03:48.102
You see him,

03:48.270 --> 03:49.420
you stop him.

03:49.545 --> 03:52.147
- Knock his head off if you have to.
- Don't do that.

03:52.556 --> 03:54.697
But I give you permission
to use excessive force.

03:54.822 --> 03:56.819
- Don't use excessive force.
- Don't go overboard.

03:57.204 --> 03:59.488
Just stop him.
By any means necessary.

04:00.949 --> 04:02.866
Just stop him.
You know what I mean.

04:04.442 --> 04:06.739
A week ago, I had nothing.

04:07.380 --> 04:09.262
Now I have a part-time job,

04:09.679 --> 04:11.880
I'm gonna make 32 bucks tonight.

04:12.804 --> 04:14.904
I owe Leslie everything I have.

04:15.236 --> 04:17.636
Which after tonight
will be 39 bucks.

04:26.083 --> 04:28.142
- Am I early?
- Nope, you are right on time.

04:29.265 --> 04:30.436
I like your costume.

04:31.100 --> 04:32.460
Thanks.
Raggedy Ann.

04:32.585 --> 04:34.701
One of my favorite books
when I was a kid.

04:37.389 --> 04:39.139
- I'm a pirate.
- Right.

04:41.244 --> 04:42.898
Dr. Harris, how are you?

04:45.502 --> 04:48.060
This is Ron Swanson
from the parks department.

04:48.185 --> 04:50.430
I know him from that thing
that I'm doing.

04:50.555 --> 04:52.005
This is Dr. Harris.

04:52.429 --> 04:54.279
- You're a doctor.
- Yeah.

04:55.550 --> 04:57.850
- I meant your costume.
- I got it.

05:00.294 --> 05:01.767
Worlds colliding.

05:02.350 --> 05:03.600
Always awkward.

05:06.525 --> 05:08.247
8:22 p.m.

05:08.372 --> 05:10.851
Suspect still with friends
in parking lot.

05:11.864 --> 05:13.896
He looks obnoxious and irritating

05:14.064 --> 05:15.914
even from a great distance.

05:18.495 --> 05:19.443
Confirmed.

05:19.767 --> 05:22.339
Normally I hate working
on halloween, but...

05:22.781 --> 05:24.937
it's nice hanging out with Leslie.

05:25.062 --> 05:27.620
You know, she's focused,
she's committed,

05:28.353 --> 05:30.733
and she made out with me
in my cop car.

05:31.119 --> 05:32.373
It was pretty neat.

05:34.459 --> 05:37.463
I shouldn't have said that.
That's clear to me now.

05:46.672 --> 05:48.705
Remember my boyfriend, Derek?

05:49.076 --> 05:50.432
And his boyfriend, Ben?

05:52.433 --> 05:54.853
It's totally okay
that you didn't wear a costume.

05:55.496 --> 05:57.147
I did.
I'm a straight person.

05:59.010 --> 06:01.006
- Sorry I'm late.
- See?

06:03.405 --> 06:06.406
Sorry it's a little bit lame right now,
but we'll get it going.

06:06.727 --> 06:09.118
I passed up a gay
halloween party to be here.

06:09.243 --> 06:11.739
Do you know how much fun
gay halloween parties are?

06:11.864 --> 06:15.670
Last year I saw three Jonas Brothers
make out with three Robert Pattinsons.

06:15.795 --> 06:17.045
It was amazing.

06:17.710 --> 06:19.461
So you're the Mark
that Ann is dating.

06:20.226 --> 06:21.726
I suppose that I am.

06:22.006 --> 06:24.508
- We're very protective of Ann.
- We look out for her.

06:24.676 --> 06:27.260
So you kind of dropped the ball
with Andy, then, didn't you?

06:29.014 --> 06:31.208
I loved Andy.
Oh, such a sweetheart.

06:31.333 --> 06:34.077
- Is Andy coming tonight?
- You should get back with Andy.

06:34.202 --> 06:35.602
Who needs a drink?

06:35.987 --> 06:36.812
I do.

06:37.509 --> 06:39.891
Suspect laughing with friends

06:40.131 --> 06:42.442
and playing
with his stupid skateboard

06:43.313 --> 06:45.856
in a snide, turd-ish manner.

06:46.262 --> 06:47.244
"Turd-ish"?

06:48.217 --> 06:49.445
Like a turd.

06:49.570 --> 06:50.967
Like a little turd.

06:51.323 --> 06:53.870
Hey, listen.
Your scare tactics clearly worked,

06:54.794 --> 06:57.937
you got Andy guarding the statue,
why don't we go to Ann's party?

06:58.642 --> 06:59.882
Have a little fun.

07:01.561 --> 07:04.944
We wanted to cover that block anyway.
Wanted a police presence, so that's...

07:05.069 --> 07:07.655
This is within the bou...
confines of...

07:07.962 --> 07:08.802
Let's go.

07:09.990 --> 07:12.330
- Let's pick up my costume at my office.
- Got it.

07:12.455 --> 07:14.605
Can't we fire a warning shot
over his head?

07:14.730 --> 07:16.429
No, babe, don't touch that.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.145
Leaving location.

07:18.313 --> 07:19.966
Look at stupid suspect.

07:20.856 --> 07:21.940
I hate suspect.

07:23.187 --> 07:25.649
- Where are my keys?
- Looks like it's open.

07:25.774 --> 07:26.624
Really?

07:41.628 --> 07:43.904
We've been tailing
that kid for a couple hours.

07:44.029 --> 07:45.901
It must've been somebody else.

07:46.026 --> 07:47.276
It was Pikitis.

07:49.083 --> 07:50.333
Believe me now.

07:50.861 --> 07:52.846
That doesn't mean anything to me.

07:53.101 --> 07:54.264
This is a peach pit.

07:55.719 --> 07:58.270
He was eating a peach
when I went to go talk to him.

07:58.395 --> 08:00.750
This is his ace of spades.
This is his calling card,

08:00.875 --> 08:03.419
this is what he leaves all his victims.
And it's still warm.

08:03.544 --> 08:05.567
Go and arrest him
and send this to the lab.

08:05.735 --> 08:07.233
We don't have a lab.

08:10.165 --> 08:12.240
You're underage.

08:12.816 --> 08:13.828
You're not.

08:15.667 --> 08:17.038
I'm gonna leave.

08:18.289 --> 08:20.805
- This isn't that fun.
- Didn't need to tell me that.

08:21.042 --> 08:22.280
I take this home.

08:22.405 --> 08:24.550
Nobody was drinking it,
so I'm gonna take it.

08:25.088 --> 08:28.036
Gonna take this too.
Been meaning to read it.

08:32.595 --> 08:34.058
This isn't strictly legal.

08:34.183 --> 08:36.408
We consult him for an hour,
and I got to let him go.

08:36.533 --> 08:39.191
You talk to him first.
You have a scary face.

08:39.434 --> 08:41.311
No, in a good way.
Scary cute.

08:42.563 --> 08:43.654
Go talk to him.

08:45.307 --> 08:47.302
I didn't do this, man.
I promise.

08:47.427 --> 08:50.362
Son, I'm a police officer,
okay, you shouldn't lie to me.

08:50.678 --> 08:51.782
I'm not.

08:51.907 --> 08:54.699
I've never been here before.
And why would I do this?

08:55.103 --> 08:57.922
Because you've had run-ins
with Miss Knope in the past.

08:59.152 --> 08:59.996
A second.

09:02.408 --> 09:04.033
<i>Ask him about the peach pit.</i>

09:04.931 --> 09:07.504
This isn't one-way glass, you know.
I can see you.

09:09.623 --> 09:11.417
You know, I like Knope.

09:11.705 --> 09:13.822
I screw with her
'cause she gets all riled up.

09:13.947 --> 09:16.221
And her face
gets all scrunched up like this.

09:16.537 --> 09:18.515
But I like her.
She's all right.

09:20.344 --> 09:21.344
You see?

09:22.020 --> 09:22.943
What?

09:23.068 --> 09:25.311
I spent the whole day
decorating this place,

09:25.436 --> 09:27.286
and everybody's in the kitchen.

09:27.411 --> 09:30.443
- Why is everyone always in the kitchen?
- I think it's going fine.

09:31.107 --> 09:32.307
It's so quiet.

09:33.105 --> 09:34.975
Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God.

09:35.100 --> 09:38.100
This is a total failure.
This party is a failure.

09:38.472 --> 09:39.522
Oh, my God.

09:39.704 --> 09:42.029
No, it's not a failure, come on.

09:42.778 --> 09:44.025
Do you have any mounds?

09:44.150 --> 09:46.394
Because all I can find
are almond joys.

09:46.519 --> 09:48.267
And almonds give me the squirts.

09:50.362 --> 09:51.131
I'm here.

09:51.447 --> 09:52.647
Statue's fine.

09:53.228 --> 09:55.757
"Crappy hallowieners".
That's hilarious.

09:55.882 --> 09:57.887
- Where's the kid?
- In the conference room,

09:58.055 --> 09:59.874
trying to hide his obvious guilt.

09:59.999 --> 10:02.603
I don't know what to tell you.
I don't think he did it.

10:02.894 --> 10:04.811
Yeah, he did,
and we need a confession.

10:06.951 --> 10:09.065
Andy and I are going to take a walk.

10:09.557 --> 10:12.694
And it's gonna be just you,
Pikitis, and these pliers.

10:13.104 --> 10:14.612
I'm not gonna torture this kid.

10:14.780 --> 10:16.103
Nobody said torture.

10:17.033 --> 10:18.491
Let me take a run at him, boss?

10:19.280 --> 10:21.880
In order to think
like one of these guys,

10:22.381 --> 10:24.122
you have to think like them.

10:24.438 --> 10:26.207
Yeah, he's never seen you before.

10:26.776 --> 10:28.746
So imply that you're
someone very important,

10:28.871 --> 10:31.045
and that you can make his life hell.

10:37.397 --> 10:39.179
Would you like
some boiling hot coffee?

10:39.597 --> 10:40.722
In the face?

10:44.767 --> 10:46.436
My name is Bert Macklin.

10:47.236 --> 10:49.436
I'm with the **** FBI.

10:50.942 --> 10:52.734
Are these the same kind of chips?

10:54.217 --> 10:56.279
- What's up, gorgeous?
- Perfect.

10:56.447 --> 10:58.407
Get your raggedy ass
over here, girl.

10:59.036 --> 11:00.116
Mad hatter?

11:00.284 --> 11:01.484
T- pain, baby.

11:01.776 --> 11:03.268
<i>She poppin', she rollin'</i>

11:03.393 --> 11:04.829
<i>She rollin'</i>

11:04.997 --> 11:06.623
<i>She climbin' the pole</i>

11:06.791 --> 11:09.159
<i>And I'm in love with the stripper</i>

11:09.764 --> 11:12.758
this isn't a stripper, it's my wife.
You remember her.

11:13.047 --> 11:14.881
- Thank you so much for inviting us.
- Sure.

11:15.049 --> 11:17.967
She's a surgeon at county general.
And she's super hot.

11:18.135 --> 11:21.596
Well, thank you for being a doctor
and not coming dressed as a doctor.

11:21.931 --> 11:24.781
Oh, my God, who'd be boring enough
to do that?

11:26.637 --> 11:28.333
What happened?
Did you tell everyone

11:28.458 --> 11:30.660
they're gonna have to get
a bone marrow transplant?

11:30.785 --> 11:32.788
They look miserable.
This party's a disaster.

11:32.913 --> 11:34.473
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.

11:34.598 --> 11:36.486
- Don't worry. We can fix this.
- Totally.

11:36.690 --> 11:37.946
Give us a second.

11:40.500 --> 11:44.035
Looks like Andy's wearing him down.
I'm gonna go finish him off.

11:45.104 --> 11:47.703
That is the dumbest thing
I have ever heard.

11:47.828 --> 11:49.450
Why don't you shut up?

11:49.575 --> 11:52.877
- What's going on in here?
- He's a jerk! He is being such a jerk!

11:53.254 --> 11:55.296
That's an awful thing
to say to a human being!

11:55.464 --> 11:57.937
- Are you crying?
- No, I'm... I am not crying, okay?

11:58.062 --> 12:00.762
- I'm allergic to jerks!
- Okay, Andy, out.

12:00.887 --> 12:02.428
Fine! I don't even care!

12:02.596 --> 12:03.696
It's stupid!

12:05.970 --> 12:07.504
The gloves are coming off.

12:09.764 --> 12:12.073
- What's that?
- I think you know what that is.

12:12.891 --> 12:15.815
When I came to visit you at the school,
you were eating a peach.

12:16.301 --> 12:19.861
Then my office gets vandalized and
somebody leaves a peach pit on my desk.

12:20.073 --> 12:22.673
I don't think that's a coincidence.

12:23.663 --> 12:24.908
You nailed me.

12:25.119 --> 12:28.221
There is no way
that two different people could've eaten

12:28.346 --> 12:30.664
the same fruit, in the same day,

12:30.833 --> 12:32.417
in the same area of Indiana.

12:32.803 --> 12:34.401
Never mind that I was

12:34.526 --> 12:36.268
actually eating a plum

12:36.515 --> 12:37.936
when you saw me earlier.

12:42.153 --> 12:44.345
I know you did this.
I don't care what you say.

12:44.513 --> 12:46.306
You were in the parking lot
all night,

12:46.754 --> 12:49.187
- you found a way to get in here.
- Wait.

12:49.477 --> 12:50.934
How did you know that?

12:51.103 --> 12:53.245
Because I followed you, genius!

12:53.906 --> 12:55.820
If you followed me all night,

12:55.945 --> 12:57.734
then you know that it wasn't me!

12:58.694 --> 13:00.111
What is your problem?

13:00.279 --> 13:03.105
I've been very civil,
but I will waterboard you.

13:03.365 --> 13:04.247
Nope.

13:05.579 --> 13:08.348
I don't think she would make a good cop.
I would be

13:08.676 --> 13:11.441
frightened to live in a town
that she's the cop of, frankly.

13:12.249 --> 13:13.374
What are you doing?

13:13.792 --> 13:16.428
- Do you want me to liven things up?
- Of course I do.

13:16.553 --> 13:19.704
Then relax. Turn off all the lights
that don't have colored bulbs.

13:23.165 --> 13:24.339
All right, y'all.

13:24.797 --> 13:26.923
Take the pigs in a blanket
and put them to sleep,

13:27.048 --> 13:28.681
it's time to get wild!

13:29.285 --> 13:32.226
Get this furniture out of here,
we're making a dance floor.

13:33.391 --> 13:34.363
Come on.

13:34.772 --> 13:37.588
Put the turkey wraps down.
We're about to get wild.

13:41.415 --> 13:43.315
Ron Swanson in the building!

13:48.744 --> 13:51.087
His mom's gonna be here soon.
Please, Dave, arrest him.

13:51.212 --> 13:53.414
- On what charge?
- Handcuff him to something.

13:54.021 --> 13:55.021
Greggy?

13:57.513 --> 13:58.377
Gregsy.

13:59.325 --> 14:00.447
Mrs. Pikitis.

14:00.572 --> 14:03.255
Hi, I'm Leslie Knope.
This is officer Sanderson.

14:03.380 --> 14:06.479
- Bert Macklin. F.B.I.
- What do you think you're doing?

14:06.604 --> 14:09.638
You can't just hold a 16-year-old kid
against his will.

14:09.807 --> 14:11.723
We were questioning him
about this vandalism.

14:11.892 --> 14:14.650
- Do you have any evidence?
- Yes. Two words.

14:14.775 --> 14:16.437
- No, we don't...
- Peach pit.

14:17.898 --> 14:20.190
- His D.N.A. is all over it.
- We don't know that.

14:20.315 --> 14:23.245
We can get it tested,
and if it matches your D.N.A.,

14:23.529 --> 14:25.908
- you're going away for a long time.
- Is this a joke?

14:28.201 --> 14:29.783
I'm calling your shift commander.

14:30.087 --> 14:32.077
Monday morning,
I am calling your boss.

14:32.560 --> 14:34.288
I don't know
who to call about you...

14:34.456 --> 14:36.453
- President of the U.S.A.
- Fine!

14:36.834 --> 14:38.599
If you ever come near my son again,

14:38.724 --> 14:41.461
I will sue you
and everyone in this building.

14:42.645 --> 14:43.726
Come on, honey.

14:46.436 --> 14:48.636
Let them think they've lost us.
Then...

14:49.279 --> 14:51.176
- Where you going?
- I got to tell my boss

14:51.301 --> 14:53.316
why I illegally detained a teenager.

14:54.245 --> 14:56.593
I shouldn't have gotten involved
with this. It's just...

14:57.254 --> 14:58.699
Just bad police work.

14:59.851 --> 15:01.901
It was bad F.B.I. work too.

15:02.724 --> 15:03.692
My bad.

15:11.577 --> 15:14.910
Tonight the "t" in T-pain
stands for "Tom Haverford"!

15:15.581 --> 15:17.038
Nurses versus doctors.

15:17.261 --> 15:18.311
On my Mark.

15:18.606 --> 15:19.416
Three,

15:19.992 --> 15:20.761
two,

15:21.271 --> 15:22.003
one,

15:22.417 --> 15:23.297
Vodka!

15:29.073 --> 15:29.872
Son.

15:30.137 --> 15:31.803
That is one hell of a costume.

15:33.829 --> 15:35.198
Damn, that's good.

15:36.078 --> 15:37.128
Nice party.

15:39.516 --> 15:40.979
Why would anyone do this?

15:41.732 --> 15:42.910
Kids are kids.

15:43.035 --> 15:45.692
Everybody does stupid stuff
like this in high school.

15:45.903 --> 15:46.777
I didn't.

15:46.902 --> 15:48.529
But you were probably a nerd?

15:49.797 --> 15:51.157
I mean that in a good way.

15:51.772 --> 15:54.284
Look at you.
You're the coolest person I've ever met.

15:55.370 --> 15:56.954
I even met John Mellencamp.

15:58.048 --> 16:00.432
Why don't you go home?
I'll finish cleaning this up.

16:00.557 --> 16:01.291
No way.

16:01.691 --> 16:04.154
You got me a job.
You're helping me turn my life around.

16:04.279 --> 16:05.588
I go home when you go home.

16:07.590 --> 16:09.049
It's city planning.

16:09.656 --> 16:12.269
It's mostly regulating things
and just making sure

16:12.394 --> 16:13.887
people obey the city code.

16:14.056 --> 16:16.222
You want to get out of here?
Go back to my place?

16:17.168 --> 16:17.955
What?

16:19.270 --> 16:20.520
I'm dating Ann.

16:21.199 --> 16:23.606
Good. That was a test.
You passed.

16:23.774 --> 16:27.079
Let's celebrate you passing the test,
over a drink at my place.

16:27.908 --> 16:29.278
No. Still no.

16:29.767 --> 16:31.383
You passed a second test.

16:31.745 --> 16:33.695
But we're still watching you.

16:38.694 --> 16:41.790
So you want to get out of here,
go back to my place?

16:49.826 --> 16:52.256
You and Tom really
turned the party around.

16:53.033 --> 16:55.054
We have a good time together.

16:55.983 --> 16:57.360
Tom told me

16:57.849 --> 17:00.449
that you know
about our green card marriage,

17:00.574 --> 17:02.227
and I just want to say thank you

17:03.349 --> 17:05.134
for not telling anyone.

17:06.712 --> 17:07.712
No worries.

17:07.962 --> 17:10.287
I'd hate for you
to have to go back to Canada.

17:13.316 --> 17:16.617
All that socialized medicine
up there.

17:17.258 --> 17:18.881
Wendylicious, where you been?

17:19.006 --> 17:21.205
I was just thanking Ron for,

17:21.330 --> 17:22.790
not telling anyone.

17:24.236 --> 17:25.431
That was cool of you.

17:25.556 --> 17:27.586
You won't have to keep it
a secret much longer

17:27.753 --> 17:30.736
because in a few months we can split up
without raising any eyebrows.

17:30.861 --> 17:33.511
And we'll invite you
to the divorce party.

17:35.698 --> 17:37.752
Maybe Greg is innocent.

17:38.299 --> 17:41.224
If that's the case, there's another kid
out there who's tormenting me.

17:41.670 --> 17:42.534
Maybe.

17:43.153 --> 17:46.305
I believe that you're innocent
until proven guilty in this country.

17:46.773 --> 17:48.606
That's the cornerstone of democracy.

17:48.818 --> 17:49.650
Sure.

17:51.540 --> 17:54.390
On the other hand,
Greg Pikitis is a little punk.

17:54.573 --> 17:55.947
I want to TP his house.

17:56.158 --> 17:57.258
Let's do it.

17:59.952 --> 18:02.245
Wait, this is fun, what do I do?

18:03.706 --> 18:06.374
You just grab the toilet paper,
unroll it a little bit,

18:06.543 --> 18:07.792
throw it over the tree.

18:08.420 --> 18:11.588
This is for mayor Percy,
this is for the Parks Department Office,

18:11.757 --> 18:13.756
this is for pooping
on the handball court!

18:18.619 --> 18:20.848
This is really fun,
but I don't condone it!

18:24.978 --> 18:27.450
Bye, guys.
You're the man, Swanson.

18:27.907 --> 18:29.205
Thanks for coming.

18:31.651 --> 18:34.320
Thank you so much.
I don't even know what to say.

18:34.759 --> 18:36.488
- Don't mention it.
- Also, Tom,

18:36.656 --> 18:38.590
your wife is super cool.

18:38.715 --> 18:39.908
So well done.

18:40.119 --> 18:41.373
She's pretty great.

18:41.498 --> 18:43.474
I don't know
how you landed that chick,

18:43.599 --> 18:45.288
but she's awesome.
Nice work.

18:45.499 --> 18:47.301
- You're lucky.
- You ready to go?

18:48.293 --> 18:50.291
Thank you so much.
We had so much fun.

18:51.171 --> 18:53.718
About to head home
and have crazy sex.

18:53.843 --> 18:55.214
That's cool. I don't...

18:59.655 --> 19:00.864
Five-0!

19:03.656 --> 19:04.975
I see you in there, Andy.

19:07.519 --> 19:08.705
What are you doing?

19:12.056 --> 19:13.900
That's them, officer.
Right there.

19:14.111 --> 19:14.977
My God.

19:16.380 --> 19:18.236
I'm so sorry.
We have the wrong house.

19:18.361 --> 19:19.999
Why are you doing this?

19:20.124 --> 19:22.321
It's hard to explain,
but we were getting revenge

19:22.446 --> 19:24.329
on this kid,
and we thought this was his house,

19:24.454 --> 19:26.871
- but I guess we got the address wrong.
- I'm Greg's mom.

19:28.051 --> 19:28.944
You are?

19:31.394 --> 19:34.004
Did he hire a fake mom again
to get him out of trouble?

19:34.476 --> 19:35.241
What?

19:35.366 --> 19:37.635
Whenever he gets in trouble
he goes on craigslist

19:37.760 --> 19:39.592
and hires a woman to play his mother

19:39.761 --> 19:40.840
and bail him out.

19:40.965 --> 19:42.462
That little s-o-b.

19:45.771 --> 19:46.706
I knew it!

19:46.831 --> 19:48.226
My God.

19:49.783 --> 19:51.355
That kid is amazing.

19:53.066 --> 19:54.274
He's not in his room.

19:54.693 --> 19:56.250
I don't know where he is.

19:57.142 --> 19:57.985
I do.

19:58.154 --> 19:59.436
Make sure you get that.

20:03.618 --> 20:05.327
Let them go!
Stay on the leader!

20:09.420 --> 20:11.320
I am gonna wring your neck!

20:11.752 --> 20:14.168
How did you get into
the Parks Department? I have to know.

20:14.337 --> 20:16.148
Maybe the F.B.I. can figure it out.

20:16.739 --> 20:18.715
I'm not even in the F.B.I., stupid.

20:20.142 --> 20:22.927
- You're amazing.
- You're going to jail for a long time.

20:23.096 --> 20:25.347
He's not gonna go to jail,
he's a minor.

20:25.515 --> 20:26.980
We'll let the jury decide.

20:27.350 --> 20:30.560
- It's not gonna be a jury, it's his...
- The judge will decide where he goes.

20:30.771 --> 20:33.700
- He's gonna do probation, he's a minor.
- Just let me have this.

20:35.442 --> 20:36.525
Nice work, Knope.

20:36.693 --> 20:37.901
That is amazing.

20:38.736 --> 20:41.737
But the thing that's driving me nuts is,
how did he do it?

20:41.906 --> 20:43.375
Halloween Day.
3:45pm

20:43.500 --> 20:45.675
If you destroy him early,
please come by.

20:45.800 --> 20:46.800
I will.

20:47.495 --> 20:49.784
How is someone gonna be able
to get through that door?

20:49.909 --> 20:51.707
What the...
Are you kidding me?

20:51.875 --> 20:54.251
We were here all th afternoon.
How did he get in?

20:55.879 --> 20:57.588
We always lock the doors

20:57.756 --> 20:58.881
when we leave.

20:59.466 --> 21:01.168
And Dave and I tailed Pikitis

21:01.293 --> 21:03.895
from the moment
he left his house at 7:00 p.m.

21:04.262 --> 21:05.969
to the moment we came back here.

21:07.017 --> 21:08.473
Does he have a look-alike?

21:09.393 --> 21:11.184
Did he have an accomplice?
Did he have help?

21:15.887 --> 21:17.567
How did that little turd do it?
