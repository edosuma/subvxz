PLEASE TAKE OFF
THAT MICROPHONE?

THE CATERER,
THE TABLE ARRANGEMENTS,

WE CAN'T THROW RICE.

THEM FOR SQUID,

WHAT I'VE LOST,
IT HAS TO BE WITH PHOEBE,

I DON'T KNOW,
WEIRD AT DINNER,

11:51.695 --> 11:53.556
KIND OF COLD.

11:53.656 --> 11:54.597
REALLY? I DIDN'T NOTICE.

11:54.697 --> 11:56.599
I WOULDN'T BRING IT UP,

11:56.699 --> 11:58.353
BUT I DON'T WANT
TO DO ANYTHING

11:58.453 --> 12:00.229
TO COME BETWEEN
YOU AND YOUR SISTER.

12:00.329 --> 12:02.289
IF US GETTING MARRIED'S
GONNA HURT THE POWER
OF THREE IN ANY WAY--

12:02.456 --> 12:05.817
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

12:05.917 --> 12:07.443
EXCEPT PAIGE HAS BEEN
NOTHING BUT SUPPORTIVE

12:07.544 --> 12:10.404
OF OUR MARRIAGE.

12:10.504 --> 12:11.572
FORGET ABOUT IT.
IT'S PROBABLY NOTHING.

12:11.672 --> 12:13.865
OK.

12:13.965 --> 12:15.283
SO, HOW DO YOU LOOK
IN YOUR WEDDING GOWN?

12:15.383 --> 12:16.827
I DON'T KNOW YET.

12:16.927 --> 12:18.286
I'VE BEEN TOO BUSY
TO TRY IT ON.

12:18.386 --> 12:20.621
WELL, WHEN YOU DO,

12:20.721 --> 12:21.872
I WANT YOU
TO PICTURE ME
TAKING IT OFF.

12:21.972 --> 12:23.891
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

12:25.309 --> 12:26.252
GOTTA GO, BABE.
LOVE YOU.

12:26.352 --> 12:29.628
I LOVE Y--
[DIAL TONE]

12:29.728 --> 12:32.649
YOU.

12:40.239 --> 12:43.600
Leo: HEY! [LAUGHS]

12:43.700 --> 12:45.685
WHAT IS
A WEDDING WITHOUT
A BACHELOR PARTY?

12:45.785 --> 12:47.644
I GOT POKER CHIPS,
CORN CHIPS.
I HAVE CHIPS.

12:47.744 --> 12:49.645
I GOT THE ENTERTAINMENT,

12:49.745 --> 12:50.867
FROM MY PRIVATE
COLLECTION I MIGHT ADD.

12:50.877 --> 12:52.732
YOU WOULDN'T HAPPEN
TO HAVE THE KEY

12:52.832 --> 12:54.734
TO THE MINIBAR
THERE, WOULD YOU?

12:54.834 --> 12:57.629
[LAUGHING]

13:06.760 --> 13:10.456
WHAT DOES THE FUTURE
HAVE IN STORE

13:10.557 --> 13:12.392
FOR PHOEBE AND COLE?

13:23.859 --> 13:27.154
Paige: OH!

13:29.615 --> 13:32.684
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

13:32.784 --> 13:33.977

Piper: HMM?

13:34.077 --> 13:36.288
LOOK, I CAN'T KEEP THIS
TO MYSELF ANY LONGER.

13:37.788 --> 13:40.774
THIS IS PHOEBE AND COLE'S
TAROT READING.

13:40.874 --> 13:43.444
THEY WERE LOVERS
IN THEIR PAST,

13:43.544 --> 13:44.612
DESPAIR FILLS
THEIR PRESENT,

13:44.712 --> 13:46.779
BUT THIS...

13:46.879 --> 13:49.575
IS THEIR FUTURE.

13:49.675 --> 13:52.035
Piper: OH, PLEASE.

13:52.135 --> 13:53.036
THIS LOOKS NOTHING
LIKE DEATH.

13:53.136 --> 13:55.204
PRUE MET HIM.
I KNOW.

13:55.305 --> 13:56.704
NO, YOU'RE MISSING
THE POINT.

13:56.804 --> 13:57.748
THIS IS A BAD OMEN.

13:57.848 --> 13:59.583
WELL,
NOT NECESSARILY.

13:59.683 --> 14:01.709
LOOK, COLE'S A NICE GUY,
FINE, WHATEVER,

14:01.809 --> 14:03.710
BUT FACE THE FACTS.

14:03.810 --> 14:05.213
HE WAS THE WORLD'S
GREATEST DEMON FOR,
WHAT, A CENTURY?

14:05.313 --> 14:07.006
YEAH, BUT WE'VE
BEEN THROUGH THAT.

14:07.106 --> 14:09.634
YEAH, I KNOW,

14:09.734 --> 14:10.812
BUT A CENTURY'S WORTH
OF BLOOD AND BAD KARMA?

14:10.822 --> 14:13.011
YOU DON'T JUST WALK
AWAY FROM THAT.

14:13.111 --> 14:14.820
GOD, I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE I'M JUST WORRIED.

14:16.821 --> 14:20.351
WELL, HAVE YOU
EVER CONSIDERED

14:20.451 --> 14:21.352
THAT MAYBE
YOU DREW THOSE CARDS

14:21.452 --> 14:23.728
BECAUSE
THEY REPRESENT
YOUR FEELINGS

14:23.828 --> 14:25.606
AND NOT
PHOEBE'S FUTURE?

14:25.706 --> 14:28.149
IT'S A POSSIBILITY.

14:28.249 --> 14:29.817
Phoebe: AAH!

14:29.917 --> 14:31.044
OH! OH! OH!

14:34.464 --> 14:35.339
OH! OH!

14:37.717 --> 14:39.741
YOU!

14:39.841 --> 14:40.742
Piper: OHH.
YOU'VE RUINED...

14:40.842 --> 14:42.744
MY WEDDING!

14:42.844 --> 14:43.924
AND THE BRIDAL SHOP
IS CLOSED TOMORROW!

14:43.934 --> 14:45.747
Piper: NOW, UH,

14:45.847 --> 14:47.224
PHOEBE, LET'S NOT BLOW
THIS OUT OF PROPORTION.

14:48.017 --> 14:51.377
MY WEDDING DRESS
COULD DOUBLE

14:51.478 --> 14:52.796
AS A CIRCUS TENT.

14:52.896 --> 14:55.174
OK, I THINK
THINGS ARE ALREADY
OUT OF PROPORTION.

14:55.274 --> 14:58.760
ALL I DID WAS
PICK UP THE DRESS.

14:58.860 --> 14:59.844
THE WRONG DRESS!

14:59.944 --> 15:01.012
NO, I CHECKED THE TAG.

15:01.112 --> 15:02.054
OH, REALLY?

15:02.154 --> 15:03.262
LET ME JUST LOOK AT THAT.

15:03.362 --> 15:05.557
"MILLIE PLATT."

15:05.657 --> 15:07.517
DO I LOOK LIKE
MILLIE PLATT TO YOU?!

15:07.617 --> 15:10.228
HUH? DO I? DO I?
DO I? DO I? DO I?

15:10.328 --> 15:12.396
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

15:12.496 --> 15:13.773
OK, YOU KNOW,

15:13.873 --> 15:15.149
IF YOU WOULD'VE PICKED
UP THE DRESS WHEN I ASKED,

15:15.249 --> 15:17.650
WE'D HAVE TIME
TO FIX THIS.

15:17.750 --> 15:20.112
DON'T WORRY.
I CAN SEW.

15:20.212 --> 15:21.278
I WILL TAKE
IN THE SEAMS,

15:21.378 --> 15:22.655
ALL OF THEM,
TONIGHT.

15:22.755 --> 15:24.506
[GASPS]

15:25.884 --> 15:26.909
OHH!

15:27.010 --> 15:29.011
AAH!

15:31.054 --> 15:34.266
SWORD!

15:42.981 --> 15:46.510
YOU'D BETTER TAKE CARE
OF THIS MESS.

15:46.610 --> 15:49.221
THERE'S GOTTA BE
SOMETHING ABOUT THIS

15:49.321 --> 15:50.222
IN THE <i>BOOK OF SHADOWS.</i>

15:50.322 --> 15:51.655
NOT THE DEMON,
MY WEDDING DRESS!

16:04.415 --> 16:07.736
ARE YOU HURT?

16:07.836 --> 16:09.279
BABY, YOU'RE NOT
SUPPOSED TO BE HERE.

16:09.380 --> 16:10.320
WELL, LEO SAID
IT WAS AN URGENT CALL.

16:10.420 --> 16:12.074
I WAS WORRIED.

16:12.174 --> 16:13.323
THANKS. I'M FINE.

16:13.423 --> 16:15.425
NO DEMON IS GONNA STOP ME
FROM MARRYING YOU TOMORROW.

16:15.593 --> 16:19.288
NOW, MY SISTER IS
ANOTHER STORY.

16:19.388 --> 16:21.706
I SAID I WAS SORRY.

16:21.806 --> 16:23.500
WHAT KIND OF DEMON
ATTACKED HERE?

16:23.600 --> 16:25.333
THIS ONE.

16:25.434 --> 16:26.334
"LAZARUS DEMON."

16:26.434 --> 16:28.796
A LAZARUS DEMON?
YOU SURE?

16:28.897 --> 16:30.433
Piper:
"RARE HIGH-LEVEL DEMONS
WITH TELEKINETIC POWERS."

16:30.443 --> 16:33.217
YUP, THAT'S
THE BAD BOY WE POPPED.

16:33.317 --> 16:35.342
HAS IT RESURRECTED YET?

16:35.442 --> 16:37.444
RESURRECTED?

16:39.446 --> 16:42.558
BEHIND YOU!

16:42.659 --> 16:44.243
SOFA!

16:46.120 --> 16:47.913
NO!

16:49.289 --> 16:50.455
PIPER, BLOW HIM UP!

16:52.625 --> 16:53.751
LEO!

17:01.300 --> 17:04.367
OHH...

17:04.468 --> 17:06.662
ARE YOU OK?

17:06.762 --> 17:08.371
I THINK SO, YEAH.

17:08.471 --> 17:10.373
HE'S GONNA BE BACK.
THE BOOK SAYS

17:10.473 --> 17:11.469
THAT LAZARUS DEMONS
GET STRONGER

17:11.479 --> 17:12.877
THE LONGER THEY ARE
OUT OF CEMETERY GROUND.

17:12.977 --> 17:15.377
CEMETERY GROUND?

17:15.477 --> 17:18.089
IT'S THE ONLY WAY
TO KEEP THEM
FROM RESURRECTING.

17:18.190 --> 17:19.214
YOU BURY THEM.

17:19.316 --> 17:20.925
SO THAT MEANS SOMEONE
INTENTIONALLY DUG HIM UP.

17:21.025 --> 17:23.011
TO ATTACK US.

17:23.111 --> 17:24.385
THE NIGHT
BEFORE MY WEDDING.

17:24.484 --> 17:26.012
YEAH, THE QUESTION
IS WHO AND WHY?

17:26.113 --> 17:28.388
Paige: I KNOW WHY.

17:28.490 --> 17:30.516
TO STOP THE WEDDING.

17:30.616 --> 17:31.559
I DID 2 TAROT READINGS,
PHOEBE.

17:31.659 --> 17:33.019
THEY BOTH SAID
THAT MARRYING COLE

17:33.120 --> 17:34.394
WOULD ONLY CAUSE
DEATH AND DESPAIR.

17:34.494 --> 17:35.897
WHAT?

17:35.997 --> 17:37.606
WELL, I'M SURPRISED
HE DIDN'T TELL YOU.

17:37.707 --> 17:38.900
HE SAW THE FIRST READING.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.400
WELL, IF I RAN SCARED
EVERY TIME THINGS
LOOKED DARK FOR US,

17:41.500 --> 17:43.695
WE'D NEVER HAVE
MADE IT THIS FAR.

17:43.795 --> 17:45.613
THAT'S TRUE.

17:45.714 --> 17:47.548
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
BOTHERING YOU, PAIGE,

17:48.924 --> 17:52.119
THAT I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT?

17:52.219 --> 17:54.621
NO, NOT REALLY.

17:54.721 --> 17:57.749
OK, GOOD.

17:57.849 --> 17:59.042
PAIGE AND I WILL BE
ON DEMON WATCH TONIGHT

17:59.142 --> 18:01.417
SO THAT PHOEBE
CAN GET SOME SLEEP.

18:01.517 --> 18:02.962
OOH, I'M TOO WIRED
TO SLEEP.

18:03.062 --> 18:05.130
WELL, MAYBE I CAN
HELP YOU RELAX

18:05.231 --> 18:06.422
WITH ONE OF
MY AROMATHERAPY
TREATMENTS.

18:06.522 --> 18:08.549
Piper: SEE, NOW,
THIS IS THE SPIRIT.

18:08.650 --> 18:11.445
EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE
AS LONG AS WE STAY TOGETHER

18:12.362 --> 18:15.530
AND STAY CALM.

18:20.161 --> 18:23.329
AAH!

18:25.706 --> 18:29.402
I JUST DID
WHAT THE SEER TOLD ME!

18:29.502 --> 18:31.737
DID SHE TELL YOU
TO KILL MY FIANCÃ©E?

18:31.837 --> 18:35.447
BECAUSE THAT'S
WHAT YOU ALMOST DID.

18:35.547 --> 18:37.533
THE SOURCE BEFORE YOU
WOULD'VE REWARDED ME

18:37.633 --> 18:40.619
FOR KILLING ONE
OF THOSE WITCHES.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.013
THE OLD SOURCE
WAS RECKLESS.

18:44.639 --> 18:45.682
NOW HE'S DEAD.

18:48.018 --> 18:50.045
YOU WANT
TO FOLLOW HIM
TO HIS GRAVE?

18:50.145 --> 18:53.047
NO.

18:53.147 --> 18:54.924
THEN LET'S GET
THIS STRAIGHT.

18:55.024 --> 18:57.509
YOU WORK FOR ME NOW.

18:57.609 --> 19:00.011
DO WHAT I TELL YOU,
I GUARANTEE YOU'LL NEVER SEE

19:00.111 --> 19:02.055
ANOTHER CEMETERY.

19:02.155 --> 19:04.556
BUT...

19:04.656 --> 19:07.435
HURT MY BRIDE AGAIN,

19:07.535 --> 19:08.660
AND I WILL BURY YOU MYSELF.

19:12.414 --> 19:15.958
AND STAY DOWN
UNTIL I NEED YOU.

19:17.584 --> 19:18.461
HOW DARE YOU UNEARTH
A LAZARUS DEMON?

19:21.422 --> 19:23.489
WE NEED A CREATURE
THAT CAN LURE YOUR WITCH

19:23.589 --> 19:25.534
INTO THE CEMETERY.

19:25.634 --> 19:26.994
BUT A LAZARUS DEMON?

19:27.094 --> 19:28.453
THE WITCHES MUST BELIEVE

19:28.553 --> 19:29.594
THEY'RE UNDER ATTACK
FOR YOUR PLAN TO WORK.

19:30.430 --> 19:31.847
THERE'S NO PLAN
WITH PHOEBE DEAD.

19:34.016 --> 19:36.500
I'M BEGINNING TO WONDER
IF YOU CAN HANDLE

19:36.600 --> 19:39.004
YOUR NEW MANTLE
OF POWER.

19:39.104 --> 19:42.505
ARE YOU QUESTIONING
MY LEADERSHIP?

19:42.606 --> 19:44.507
NO. YOU INHERITED
THE WORLD'S EVIL.

19:44.607 --> 19:47.510
I'LL FOLLOW THAT
ANYWHERE.

19:47.610 --> 19:49.013
BUT?
Seer: COLE.

19:49.113 --> 19:51.223
HE'S STILL ALIVE
INSIDE YOU.

19:51.323 --> 19:53.615
AND HE LOVES
THE WITCH.

19:54.616 --> 19:55.327
I KNOW.
I CAN FEEL IT.

19:58.121 --> 20:01.149
WHEN YOU WERE
A DEMON,

20:01.249 --> 20:03.417
HIS LOVE FOR HER
RUINED MORE THAN
ONE GOOD PLAN.

20:03.624 --> 20:06.987
IT'S DIFFERENT NOW.

20:07.087 --> 20:10.072
COLE'S VOICE USED
TO SCREAM INSIDE MY HEAD.

20:10.173 --> 20:12.158
NOW IT'S JUST A WHISPER.

20:12.258 --> 20:13.552
WE CAN USE HIS FEELINGS
TO CONTROL HER.

20:22.559 --> 20:26.212
SO, WE'LL TAKE SHIFTS,
AND I WILL GO FIRST,

20:26.312 --> 20:29.481
AND THEN PAIGE
WILL WAKE YOU UP
IN THE MORNING.

20:30.899 --> 20:31.858
WHAT IS THIS?

20:34.278 --> 20:35.345

20:35.445 --> 20:37.263
ALSO KNOWN
AS HEAVEN IN A JAR.
IT'S A SPECIAL BLEND.

20:37.363 --> 20:39.848
YOU MADE IT?

20:39.949 --> 20:40.849
MM-HMM.

20:40.949 --> 20:42.321

ABOUT YOUR WEDDING DRESS.

SO GREAT FOR YOU TOMORROW.

20:50.584 --> 20:53.043
IT'S OK.

21:02.177 --> 21:05.455
SHE'S TRYING.

21:05.555 --> 21:06.679
YEAH, I KNOW, I KNOW.

21:06.930 --> 21:09.391
IT COULDN'T HURT, RIGHT?

21:10.517 --> 21:11.876
YOU STILL
FEELING TENSE?

21:11.976 --> 21:14.586
IT'S NOT REALLY TENSE,
JUST, UM...

21:14.686 --> 21:17.588
EXTREMELY ALERT.

21:17.688 --> 21:20.343
PHOEBE, I KNOW YOU WANT
THE CINDERELLA FANTASY,

21:20.443 --> 21:23.637
BUT I DON'T WANT YOU
TO BE UPSET

21:23.737 --> 21:26.056
IF EVERYTHING
DOESN'T GO EXACTLY
AS PLANNED TOMORROW.

21:26.156 --> 21:29.599
WHERE IS
THAT COMING FROM?

21:29.699 --> 21:32.353
WELL, I WAS
JUST REMEMBERING
MY WEDDING DAY.

21:32.453 --> 21:34.980
AND I REMEMBER I WANTED

21:35.080 --> 21:36.605
EVERYTHING TO BE
ABSOLUTELY PERFECT--

21:36.705 --> 21:38.900
AND THEN PRUE CRASHED
THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR

21:39.000 --> 21:41.194

YEAH.

21:41.294 --> 21:43.711
ONLY PRUE COULD MAKE
MY WEDDING DAY
ALL ABOUT HER.

21:45.881 --> 21:49.717
THE POINT IS
I BARELY REMEMBER
THE CEREMONY.

21:50.717 --> 21:53.913
IT'S A TOTAL BLUR.

21:54.013 --> 21:57.458
AND IN THE END,
ALL THAT MATTERS

21:57.558 --> 21:59.127
IS THAT YOU MARRY THE GUY
THAT YOU LOVE.

21:59.227 --> 22:01.462
AND IF YOU MANAGE
TO DO THAT,

22:01.562 --> 22:03.897

HEAR YOU.

WHEN YOU'RE
ON DEMON WATCH
IN THIS HOUSE,

BATHROOM BREAKS.

23:25.800 --> 23:29.121

23:29.221 --> 23:31.223

24:20.848 --> 24:23.751

24:23.851 --> 24:24.753

24:24.853 --> 24:25.896

TO WAKE ME UP!

24:29.191 --> 24:32.468

YOUR FAULT.

ON MY FACE CREAM.

24:52.669 --> 24:55.446

ARE ALL-NATURAL
INGREDIENTS.

24:55.546 --> 24:58.199
IF YOU HAD SOMETHING
TO SAY TO ME,

24:58.299 --> 24:59.866
WHY DIDN'T YOU
JUST SAY IT, PAIGE?

24:59.966 --> 25:01.744
OK, WE ALL JUST NEED
TO TAKE A DEEP BREATH--

25:01.844 --> 25:04.246
Paige: SAY WHAT?

25:04.346 --> 25:05.914
DON'T THINK
THAT I DON'T KNOW

25:06.014 --> 25:07.499

FEEL ABOUT COLE.

THAT IS NOT NECESSARY.

25:15.773 --> 25:17.798
WE ALL JUST NEED
TO CALM DOWN--

TRYING TO PROVE TO YOU
THAT I'M NOT TRYING
TO SABOTAGE YOUR WEDDING.

25:41.587 --> 25:44.406

THINK--

25:44.506 --> 25:45.782
LET THE OBJECT
OF OBJECTION
BECOME BUT A DREAM

25:45.882 --> 25:47.824

STOP FOLLOWING ME.
GO AWAY!

26:28.294 --> 26:30.862

26:30.962 --> 26:31.863

WALK AROUND NAKED,

IT'LL FIT NOW.

Phoebe: AAH!

26:36.134 --> 26:37.578
PAIGE, WHAT DIFFERENCE
DOES IT MAKE?
I AM INVISIBLE.

26:37.678 --> 26:39.870
MY WEDDING'S SUPPOSED
TO START IN LESS
THAN ONE HOUR.

26:39.970 --> 26:42.457
EVERYONE I'VE EVER
KNOWN IS THERE,

26:42.557 --> 26:44.333
AND I'M NEVER GONNA
BE ABLE TO FACE THEM AGAIN.

26:44.433 --> 26:46.085
AAH!

26:46.185 --> 26:47.294
ALL RIGHT!

26:47.394 --> 26:48.961
THIS IS ALL JUST
A BACKFIRE TO
THE VANISHING SPELL.

26:49.062 --> 26:52.356
THERE'S GOTTA BE
A REVERSAL IN HERE.

26:52.982 --> 26:55.234
HEY.

26:56.152 --> 26:57.052
WHAT'S GOIN' ON
UP HERE?

26:57.153 --> 26:58.846

SHE IS STILL
PUTTING ON HER FACE.

27:03.116 --> 27:04.991
I CAN'T KEEP STALLING
THIS PHOTOGRAPHER
FOREVER.

IN EVERY ROOM
OF THE HOUSE.

27:09.205 --> 27:10.957
Phoebe: SEND HIM AHEAD
TO THE CHURCH.

27:11.081 --> 27:12.416
PHOEBE?

27:14.335 --> 27:15.235
THAT WAS ME.

27:15.335 --> 27:16.902
I'M WORKING ON
MY IMPRESSIONS.

27:17.002 --> 27:19.280
Phoebe:
GO DOWNSTAIRS, DAD.

27:19.380 --> 27:20.281
WAIT FOR US THERE.

27:20.381 --> 27:21.758
SEE? I'M
WORKING IT IN
TO THE TOAST.

27:26.930 --> 27:30.289
Phoebe: OH,
WHAT'S THE USE?

27:30.390 --> 27:32.041
I MIGHT AS WELL CALL COLE
AND TELL HIM IT'S OFF.

27:32.141 --> 27:34.001
Piper: OH, HONEY,
WE'LL--WE'LL--
WE'LL--WE'LL--

27:34.101 --> 27:36.002
Paige: SOMETHING YOU
SAID IS BOTHERING ME.

27:36.103 --> 27:37.921
WHY WOULD THERE
BE A BACKFIRE TO
THE VANISHING SPELL?

27:38.021 --> 27:40.565
UH, PERSONAL GAIN,
I GUESS.

27:41.691 --> 27:43.385
YEAH, BUT THERE
WASN'T ANY OF THAT

27:43.485 --> 27:44.719
WHEN I USED IT
TO HELP OTHERS.
WHY PHOEBE?

27:44.819 --> 27:46.721
WHAT, ARE YOU
SUGGESTING THAT
THERE IS

27:46.821 --> 27:47.972
OUTSIDE MAGIC
AT PLAY HERE?

27:48.072 --> 27:49.931
YEAH. THE SAME
MAGIC THAT DUG UP
THE LAZARUS DEMON...

27:50.031 --> 27:53.059
AND THEN THERE
WAS THE ACNE

27:53.159 --> 27:54.520
AND THEN--
AND THE SUPERSIZED
WEDDING DRESS.

27:54.620 --> 27:56.689
Phoebe:
SHE'S RAMBLING.

27:56.789 --> 27:57.898
SHOULD I YELL
AT HER AGAIN?

27:57.998 --> 27:58.938
NO! SHE MIGHT
BE ONTO SOMETHING.

27:59.039 --> 28:00.940
LISTEN, WE'RE
NOT FIGHTING
EACH OTHER HERE.

28:01.040 --> 28:02.942
WE'RE FIGHTING EVIL.

28:03.042 --> 28:03.943
WE KICK EVIL'S ASS
EVERY DAY.

28:04.043 --> 28:05.821
SOMETIMES
TWICE A DAY.

28:05.922 --> 28:07.114
OK, AND TODAY'S
A DAY JUST LIKE
ANY OTHER DAY.

28:07.214 --> 28:09.324
EVIL WANTS THIS
WEDDING CANCELED?

28:09.424 --> 28:11.200
SCREW THAT.

28:11.300 --> 28:12.410
WE'RE NOT GONNA GO DOWN
WITHOUT A FIGHT.

28:12.510 --> 28:14.952
OK. SO, WHAT WE DO
IS WE GET DRESSED.

28:15.053 --> 28:16.789
WE HEAD TO THE CHURCH
WHILE WE LOOK FOR
A WAY TO FIX PHOEBE.

28:16.889 --> 28:19.957
ARE YOU WITH ME?

28:20.057 --> 28:21.293
YES. PHOEBE?

28:21.393 --> 28:22.959
Phoebe:
GRAB THE BOOK.

TO START 15 MINUTES AGO.
WHERE ARE THE GIRLS?

28:46.080 --> 28:48.942
PHOEBE
NEEDS TO TALK TO YOU
IN THE DRESSING ROOM.

28:49.042 --> 28:51.945
IT'S BAD LUCK
FOR THE GROOM

28:52.045 --> 28:53.081
TO SEE THE BRIDE
BEFORE THE WEDDING.

THAT THAT'S GONNA
BE A PROBLEM.

Piper: HEY!
YOU PUT HER DOWN!

34:57.530 --> 34:58.281
EXCUSE ME.

35:01.407 --> 35:01.909
KEEP GOING. PLEASE.

35:04.828 --> 35:06.188
JUST KEEP GOING.

35:06.288 --> 35:07.189
A-A-A-AS I WAS SAYING,

35:07.289 --> 35:09.024
IT'S MY PRIVILEGE
TO ASK,

35:09.124 --> 35:10.315
WHO GIVES THIS WOMAN
TO THIS MAN TODAY?

35:10.415 --> 35:12.543
UH, HER SISTERS
AND I DO.

35:13.417 --> 35:15.171
Piper: YOU SON
OF A BITCH!

35:16.838 --> 35:18.422
Paige: I GOT HIM!
I GOT HIM!

35:19.423 --> 35:21.134
Leo: PIPER,
LOOK OUT!

35:37.439 --> 35:40.551
STOP!

35:40.651 --> 35:41.735
Piper: UNH!

35:44.363 --> 35:47.390
WHERE'S PAIGE?

35:47.490 --> 35:48.699
I DON'T KNOW.

35:50.450 --> 35:51.370
LEO, WHERE'S PAIGE?

35:53.704 --> 35:55.064
Leo: I CAN'T GET
A READ ON HER.

35:55.164 --> 35:57.375
Leo: WHEREVER SHE IS,
HER HEART'S NOT BEATING.

35:59.000 --> 36:00.460
OVER HERE.

36:03.213 --> 36:06.674
Phoebe:
OH, MY GOD.
PAIGE.

36:08.466 --> 36:11.494
WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON IN HERE?

36:11.594 --> 36:14.122
THAT'S IT.

36:14.223 --> 36:15.707
THE WEDDING IS OFF.

36:15.807 --> 36:17.083
TELL EVERYONE
TO GET OUT OF HERE.

36:17.183 --> 36:19.185
GO, GO, GO!

36:30.485 --> 36:34.223
Piper: JUST SEND
THE FOOD TO THE HOUSE.

36:34.323 --> 36:36.700
YES. AND THE BILL.

36:37.617 --> 36:38.952
NOT AS SORRY AS I AM.

36:39.869 --> 36:42.272
THANK YOU.

36:42.372 --> 36:44.190
CATERER'S
TAKEN CARE OF.

36:44.290 --> 36:45.608
THANK YOU
SO MUCH, PIPER.

36:45.708 --> 36:47.067
I JUST--I CAN'T
DEAL WITH ANY OF
THAT RIGHT NOW.

36:47.167 --> 36:48.986
Piper: IT'S OK.
IT'S BEEN A TOUGH DAY.

36:49.086 --> 36:50.778
HOW 'BOUT YOU?
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

36:50.879 --> 36:53.573
UM, STILL
A LITTLE SHAKY.

36:53.673 --> 36:55.406
WE NEARLY LOST YOU.

36:55.507 --> 36:56.868
YOU'RE LUCKY
THE DEMON HESITATED
WHEN COLE YELLED.

36:56.968 --> 36:58.970
YEAH,
BUT WHY DID HE?

36:59.928 --> 37:01.622
MAYBE HE WAS SURPRISED
SOMEBODY YELLED AT HIM.

37:01.722 --> 37:03.348
WE SHOULD ALL
JUST BE THANKFUL
THAT WE'RE ALIVE.

37:04.514 --> 37:07.417
AND VISIBLE.

37:07.517 --> 37:09.128
ALTHOUGH I'M NOT SURE
HOW THAT HAPPENED.

37:09.229 --> 37:10.713
Cole: I DO.
THE MAGIC YOU
WERE UNDER

37:10.813 --> 37:12.589
WAS SUPPOSED TO
STOP THE WEDDING.

37:12.690 --> 37:13.925
IT WORE OFF
ONCE THE WEDDING
WAS CANCELED.

37:14.025 --> 37:15.967
OH, YOU MEAN
WHEN EVIL WON?

37:16.067 --> 37:17.552
I AM NOT
STOPPING

37:17.652 --> 37:19.387
UNTIL I FIND OUT
WHO SENT THAT
THING AFTER US.

37:19.487 --> 37:21.513
Piper: SPEAKING
OF THE DEMON...

37:21.613 --> 37:23.615
THE CRISPY CRITTER
NEEDS TO FIND ITS WAY
BACK TO A CEMETERY.

37:24.200 --> 37:27.518
WELL, I KNOW
A LOCAL HAUNT.

37:27.619 --> 37:29.604
I CAN TAKE IT
THERE.

37:29.704 --> 37:31.315
Piper: AND WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN MY FREEZE WEARS OFF
ON THE WAY?

37:31.415 --> 37:33.775
YOU'LL BE AS DEFENSELESS
AS A CAT TOY.

37:33.875 --> 37:36.210
I'LL GO WITH HIM.

37:37.170 --> 37:38.544
I WANNA MAKE SURE
IT'S IN THE GROUND
FOR GOOD.

37:39.796 --> 37:42.257
LET'S ALL
DO IT.

37:43.548 --> 37:44.509
FINE BY ME.

37:51.057 --> 37:54.377
I FOUND A SPOT.

37:54.477 --> 37:55.935
THIS HEADSTONE'S
FROM THE EARLY
1900s.

37:57.561 --> 37:59.546
NOBODY WILL COME
DIGGING HERE
ANYTIME SOON.

37:59.647 --> 38:01.983
Leo: PIPER, IF YOU
SEE ANYONE COMING,
FREEZE THEM.

38:04.735 --> 38:07.763
DON'T WORRY, HONEY.

38:07.863 --> 38:09.014
IT TOOK LEO AND ME
3 TIMES TO GET MARRIED.

38:09.114 --> 38:11.975
IT'LL HAPPEN
FOR YOU AND COLE.

38:12.075 --> 38:13.643
WE JUST NEED
TO FIGURE OUT

38:13.743 --> 38:15.476
WHAT KIND OF EVIL STOPPED
YOUR WEDDING AND WHY.

38:15.576 --> 38:18.479
Paige: I HAVE
AN IDEA.

38:18.579 --> 38:20.248
WHY DON'T WE
JUST ASK IT?

38:21.166 --> 38:22.375
OH, DON'T BE CRAZY.

38:24.584 --> 38:26.154
THAT LAZARUS DEMON
IS A TIME BOMB
WAITING TO EXPLODE.

38:26.254 --> 38:28.881
NO. I WANNA KNOW WHO
RUINED THE HAPPIEST
DAY OF MY LIFE.

38:37.556 --> 38:41.126
PHOEBE, I'M ASKING YOU
PLEASE, FOR ME.

38:41.226 --> 38:43.002
DON'T DO THIS.

38:43.102 --> 38:44.395
COLE, I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU DON'T WANNA KNOW.

38:53.610 --> 38:56.847
ONE FLINCH...

38:56.947 --> 38:58.266
AND I BLOW YOU
INTO BRIQUETTES.

38:58.366 --> 39:00.200
WHO RESURRECTED YOU?

39:03.328 --> 39:06.581
ASK HIM!

39:07.998 --> 39:11.609
YOU SWORE I'D NEVER
SEE A CEMETERY AGAIN

39:11.709 --> 39:13.862
IF I HELPED YOU.

39:13.962 --> 39:14.904
YOU SET ME UP.

39:15.004 --> 39:16.630
Piper: COLE?

39:18.258 --> 39:19.200
WHAT IS THIS DEMON
TALKING ABOUT?

39:19.300 --> 39:20.676
I HAVE NO IDEA.

39:21.635 --> 39:22.953
LIAR!

39:23.053 --> 39:24.288
YOU ORDERED ME
TO ATTACK THEM
IN THE CHURCH.

39:24.388 --> 39:26.415
IS THIS HOW
YOU REWARD
YOUR LOYAL SERVANTS?

39:26.515 --> 39:28.891
OK, COLE,
WHAT IS GOING ON,

39:29.809 --> 39:32.103
BECAUSE I GOTTA
TELL YOU RIGHT NOW
I AM FREAKING OUT!

39:34.646 --> 39:38.091
AH, WHAT'S THE POINT?

39:38.191 --> 39:39.485
YOU ALREADY
FIGURED IT OUT.

39:41.652 --> 39:44.805
OH, NO!

39:44.905 --> 39:45.806
NO, IT CAN'T BE.

39:45.906 --> 39:47.183
NO.

39:47.283 --> 39:48.450
IT CAN'T BE. NO.

39:50.619 --> 39:53.562
IT'S NOT.

39:53.662 --> 39:54.564
IT'S THE SEER.

39:54.664 --> 39:56.374
Piper: NOT FOR LONG.

39:57.458 --> 39:58.566
DON'T!

39:58.666 --> 39:59.667
Piper: AHH!

40:00.668 --> 40:01.669
WHERE IS COLE?

40:03.213 --> 40:04.506
UNCONSCIOUS
IN THE MAUSOLEUM.

40:05.424 --> 40:07.551
Paige: WHY WOULD
YOU SAVE US ONE DAY

40:08.552 --> 40:09.453
AND TRY TO KILL US
THE NEXT?

40:09.553 --> 40:10.787
Seer: FOR THE SAME REASON--

40:10.887 --> 40:12.578
TO KEEP THE BALANCE
OF POWER BETWEEN
GOOD AND EVIL.

40:12.679 --> 40:15.166
Piper: DON'T BE CRYPTIC.

40:15.266 --> 40:16.582
I HATE CRYPTIC.

40:16.682 --> 40:18.085
I HAD A VISION.

40:18.185 --> 40:19.628
IF YOU MARRIED
COLE ON THIS DAY,

40:19.728 --> 40:21.754
HIS LOVE WOULD HAVE
HELPED YOU EVOLVE

40:21.855 --> 40:23.881
INTO A MUCH
STRONGER WITCH,
TOO STRONG.

40:23.981 --> 40:26.591
I HAD TO STOP YOU...

40:26.691 --> 40:28.194
AND I DID.

40:31.488 --> 40:34.598
BITCH!

40:34.698 --> 40:35.809
COLE...

40:35.909 --> 40:37.435
GO. I'LL BURY
THE REST OF THE DEMON.

40:37.535 --> 40:39.412
Phoebe: OH!

40:59.639 --> 41:02.722
COLE!

41:06.726 --> 41:10.089
IT WAS THE SEER.

41:10.189 --> 41:11.756
SHE'S IN THE CEMETERY.

41:11.856 --> 41:12.757
Piper: YEAH.
WE KNOW.

41:12.857 --> 41:14.384
WE HAD
A LITTLE CHAT.

41:14.484 --> 41:15.677
I'M SURPRISED
SHE DIDN'T
KILL YOU.

41:15.777 --> 41:17.428
Cole: THAT'S
NOT HER STYLE.

41:17.528 --> 41:18.736
KILLING'S BENEATH HER.

41:19.905 --> 41:21.723
SHE ONLY DOES IT
IF SHE HAS TO.

41:21.823 --> 41:23.741
COME ON, LET'S
GET YOU HOME.

41:25.452 --> 41:28.605
YOU OK?

41:28.705 --> 41:30.356
Paige:
I STILL DON'T
UNDERSTAND.

41:30.456 --> 41:31.607
IF THE SEER
WANTED TO STOP

41:31.707 --> 41:32.648
PHOEBE FROM
MARRYING YOU,

41:32.748 --> 41:33.984
WOULDN'T
SHE WANT
TO KILL YOU?

41:34.085 --> 41:36.571
I DON'T KNOW.
YOU'D HAVE TO
ASK THE SEER.

41:36.671 --> 41:38.296
LOOK.
A CHAPEL.

41:40.173 --> 41:43.658
Paige: A CHAPEL
IN A MAUSOLEUM?

41:43.758 --> 41:45.244
Leo: THAT'S A FIRST.

41:45.344 --> 41:46.787
IT'S CUTE.

41:46.887 --> 41:48.330
AND PERFECT.

41:48.430 --> 41:50.707
FOR WHAT?

41:50.807 --> 41:52.834
A WEDDING.

41:52.934 --> 41:54.768
I COULDN'T
AGREE MORE.

41:56.769 --> 41:59.672
REALLY?

41:59.772 --> 42:01.049
YOU'VE GOT THE RINGS.

42:01.149 --> 42:02.675
AND WE'RE ALL HERE.

42:02.775 --> 42:04.069
OK. I DO.

42:05.612 --> 42:06.762
I MEAN, I MEAN...

42:06.862 --> 42:08.780
I WILL. LET'S GO!

42:32.553 --> 42:35.846
[MUSIC OVER DIALOGUE]

43:05.080 --> 43:08.732
Priest: NOT TWO,
BUT ONE...

43:08.832 --> 43:11.085
TILL LIFE BE GONE.

43:14.837 --> 43:18.343
YOU MAY KISS THE BRIDE.

43:29.310 --> 43:32.505
WE DID IT.

43:32.605 --> 43:34.314
YES, WE DID.

43:41.987 --> 43:45.324
IT IS DONE.
