00:01.946 --> 00:05.029
(film reel rattling)

00:16.647 --> 00:19.814
(contemplative music)

01:06.744 --> 01:09.411
(lips smacking)

01:10.320 --> 01:12.487
(panting)

01:15.429 --> 01:18.680
(Collin grunting)

01:18.680 --> 01:21.263
(Kate moaning)

01:31.983 --> 01:34.583
- [Kate] I think that
went pretty well earlier.

01:34.583 --> 01:35.577
- [Collin] What are you referring to?

01:35.577 --> 01:37.445
(both chuckle)

01:37.445 --> 01:38.910
- [Kate] I'm referring to our shoot.

01:38.910 --> 01:40.530
- [Collin] Uh-huh.

01:40.530 --> 01:42.200
What was that model's name?

01:42.200 --> 01:43.350
- [Kate] The annoying one?

01:43.350 --> 01:44.680
- Yeah.
- Lauren.

01:44.680 --> 01:47.060
You were doing the humming thing again.

01:47.060 --> 01:48.331
- No.
- You were. (chuckles)

01:48.331 --> 01:50.599
- (chuckles) No.
- I swear to God.

01:50.599 --> 01:52.287
(Kate hums)
- Oh my god, no.

01:52.287 --> 01:54.610
- And you were saying
it, you were doing it

01:54.610 --> 01:56.400
in between directions,

01:56.400 --> 01:58.020
so you were like, could
you stand right there,

01:58.020 --> 01:58.853
and then she couldn't really do it,

01:58.853 --> 02:00.683
and you were like. (hums)

02:00.683 --> 02:01.520
(Collin chuckles)

02:01.520 --> 02:02.670
- No, I wasn't.
- Mm-hmm.

02:02.670 --> 02:03.932
- That obvious?
- Yes, it was.

02:03.932 --> 02:05.047
- Oh my god.

02:06.603 --> 02:07.920
I was irritated, what do you want?

02:07.920 --> 02:09.213
- Yeah, I know.

02:09.213 --> 02:12.496
(Kate humming)
(Collin chuckles)

02:12.496 --> 02:14.340
(Kate laughs)
- Oh god.

02:14.340 --> 02:16.200
My mom used to call me out on that too.

02:16.200 --> 02:17.033
- Did she really?

02:17.033 --> 02:18.323
I didn't know she noticed.

02:20.410 --> 02:22.630
- You know, now that we're
calling each other out on things,

02:22.630 --> 02:24.790
you like to sleep in the
middle of the bed like this.

02:24.790 --> 02:26.153
Like, oh, yeah, Collin,

02:26.153 --> 02:28.017
there's just no room for you here.

02:28.017 --> 02:28.850
- I'm sorry, I'm just
- On this California king.

02:28.850 --> 02:30.940
- trying to get closer to you.

02:30.940 --> 02:33.650
- Oh, that's a stretch.
(Kate laughing)

02:33.650 --> 02:34.880
You do it when you're unconscious,

02:34.880 --> 02:35.990
like when you're sleeping.

02:35.990 --> 02:36.976
- Mm.

02:36.976 --> 02:39.559
(Kate humming)

02:40.520 --> 02:41.990
- Oh, well, I guess, (stammers)

02:41.990 --> 02:44.170
how am I, what am I supposed to do

02:44.170 --> 02:45.110
when I'm dealing with you?

02:45.110 --> 02:48.080
- With me?
- Yeah, some annoying model.

02:48.080 --> 02:49.779
Am I supposed to say, uh--

02:49.779 --> 02:50.940
- I'm not an annoying model.

02:50.940 --> 02:54.318
- I didn't call you an
annoying model, but sometimes,

02:54.318 --> 02:57.023
am I just supposed to
be like, hi, excuse me,

02:59.350 --> 03:02.640
I'm slightly frustrated.
(Kate giggling)

03:02.640 --> 03:05.430
Could you please
(chuckling) stop doing that?

03:05.430 --> 03:06.780
No, of course not.

03:06.780 --> 03:07.613
You kidding me?
- No.

03:07.613 --> 03:09.070
You don't have to say
it all formal like that

03:09.070 --> 03:10.080
but you could at least just try

03:10.080 --> 03:11.770
expressing yourself with words.

03:11.770 --> 03:14.296
- I think you're overrating
expression slightly.

03:14.296 --> 03:15.630
(Kate chuckles)
You know what, you should

03:15.630 --> 03:18.240
consider yourself lucky that I'm, uh,

03:18.240 --> 03:21.410
that, you know, you can know
why I'm doing that because--

03:21.410 --> 03:23.560
- Because most people just
think you're a really weird guy

03:23.560 --> 03:24.761
who hums when he's frustrated?
(Collin laughing)

03:24.761 --> 03:27.000
Is that what you're saying?
(both giggling)

03:27.000 --> 03:28.330
- No, because you know me that well

03:28.330 --> 03:31.710
and most people just think
that I can't carry a tune.

03:31.710 --> 03:33.160
- Honey, it's not really a tune.

03:33.160 --> 03:36.837
It's more of a grating, like. (humming)

03:36.837 --> 03:38.250
- (chuckling) Okay, all right.

03:38.250 --> 03:40.430
Okay, back to the question
about the humming,

03:40.430 --> 03:44.690
it's just not always best to articulate

03:45.560 --> 03:47.373
what you're feeling with words.

03:48.583 --> 03:50.822
- I get you, I do.

03:50.822 --> 03:52.360
But you really can't give me too much shit

03:52.360 --> 03:55.440
for having an unconscious
desire to be close to you.

03:55.440 --> 03:57.640
Don't you think it's a good thing?

03:57.640 --> 04:00.750
How many couples do we know
who never touch in public

04:00.750 --> 04:02.270
or are super weird around each other

04:02.270 --> 04:04.360
and then when it comes up, you
find out they only have sex

04:04.360 --> 04:06.200
like once a month or something?

04:06.200 --> 04:08.430
Don't you think our physical closeness

04:08.430 --> 04:10.180
is a reflection of our intimacy?

04:10.180 --> 04:12.680
That I want to be touching
you while I'm sleeping?

04:15.820 --> 04:17.160
- Yeah, I can agree with that.

04:17.160 --> 04:17.993
- Mm.

04:19.040 --> 04:20.427
- But you are a restless sleeper.

04:20.427 --> 04:23.249
- (chuckles) I'm sorry.

04:23.249 --> 04:25.582
- I'm gonna go smoke.
- Okay.

04:37.361 --> 04:39.944
(Collin sighs)

04:48.630 --> 04:49.463
Thanks.

04:52.810 --> 04:54.890
- If you let me smoke
the occasional cigarette

04:54.890 --> 04:58.210
inside the house, we
wouldn't have to be out here.

04:58.210 --> 04:59.600
- Sorry, honey.

04:59.600 --> 05:00.660
- Hold on.

05:00.660 --> 05:01.713
Stay right there.

05:07.625 --> 05:10.875
(floorboards creaking)

05:24.954 --> 05:27.871
(shutter clicking)

05:31.086 --> 05:32.824
(Kate inhales)

05:32.824 --> 05:35.438
- All right, I'm cold.

07:03.457 --> 07:06.101
(shutter clicking)

07:06.101 --> 07:07.351
- [Kate] Sofia.

07:18.910 --> 07:19.913
Yeah, love it.

07:22.277 --> 07:25.194
(shutter clicking)

07:28.600 --> 07:29.433
Alex is here.

07:36.862 --> 07:37.753
Hey, come on in.

07:45.940 --> 07:47.540
Thanks for coming.
- Of course.

07:49.830 --> 07:51.553
- [Kate] Collin, this is Alex.

07:52.409 --> 07:53.242
- Hi.

07:53.242 --> 07:55.810
- [Alex] I've heard a lot
about you and love your work.

07:55.810 --> 07:57.020
- Thank you.

07:57.020 --> 07:58.936
With the right help, the
pictures take themselves.

07:58.936 --> 07:59.830
(Kate chuckles)

07:59.830 --> 08:02.400
- We met on that one shoot I
did as a favor for Juliano.

08:02.400 --> 08:03.649
- Mm.
- He's so intense.

08:03.649 --> 08:05.400
- (chuckling) Yes, he is.
- Mm-hmm.

08:05.400 --> 08:06.530
- Anyway, Alex is great.

08:06.530 --> 08:08.580
She styles and can do makeup.

08:08.580 --> 08:11.820
I think she may be the
perfect person to fill in.

08:11.820 --> 08:12.870
- Cool.

08:12.870 --> 08:14.437
Well, nice to meet you.

08:14.437 --> 08:15.880
- [Sofia] How's this?

08:15.880 --> 08:17.227
- Perfect.
- Great.

08:18.090 --> 08:19.353
- Let's test, um...

08:20.850 --> 08:22.010
- So, is it official?

08:22.010 --> 08:24.010
Are you moving to San Francisco?

08:24.010 --> 08:25.760
- Most of my classes are
Monday through Wednesday,

08:25.760 --> 08:28.220
so I can spend long weekends
and still take jobs.

08:28.220 --> 08:29.943
- Wow, that's a lot of travel.

08:31.460 --> 08:33.799
It's crazy how you guys work together.

08:33.799 --> 08:35.919
I could never work with my boyfriend.

08:35.919 --> 08:38.080
Too much crossover for me.

08:38.080 --> 08:39.309
- Can you do hair also?

08:39.309 --> 08:42.179
- Yeah, I can do Last-Looks-type stuff,

08:42.179 --> 08:45.280
but nothing too
complicated like a chignon.

08:45.280 --> 08:48.631
(both chuckling)
- She's great, I promise.

08:48.631 --> 08:49.990
- Okay.

08:49.990 --> 08:50.870
Well, I'm gonna...

08:50.870 --> 08:52.233
- Yeah, I'll be right there.

08:54.141 --> 08:56.514
All right, I'm gonna get to it.

08:56.514 --> 08:59.681
(contemplative music)

09:02.490 --> 09:03.973
So, what do you think?

09:03.973 --> 09:05.777
- [Collin] I think it went well.

09:05.777 --> 09:06.863
- Not the shoot.

09:08.640 --> 09:09.600
- What?

09:09.600 --> 09:10.433
- Alex?

09:12.000 --> 09:13.263
- [Collin] She seems cool.

09:14.100 --> 09:15.640
- Good.

09:15.640 --> 09:16.473
I'm glad you liked her.

09:16.473 --> 09:17.760
Hopefully, it'll work out.

09:20.127 --> 09:21.070
- I'll have to work with her to know

09:21.070 --> 09:22.883
if she can actually do the job.

09:24.080 --> 09:26.200
- Of course, I'm just glad
you thought she was cool

09:26.200 --> 09:27.500
and you'll give her a try.

09:30.379 --> 09:34.090
(contemplative music)

09:34.090 --> 09:35.590
- Hopefully, it won't come up.

09:37.940 --> 09:39.857
- What do you mean?

09:39.857 --> 09:42.890
- I'm going to try and schedule
shoots for when you're here.

09:42.890 --> 09:44.800
- Is that realistic?

09:44.800 --> 09:45.633
- We'll see.

09:50.610 --> 09:51.640
- Alex is still downtown.

09:51.640 --> 09:53.880
Do you wanna meet her for a drink?

09:53.880 --> 09:55.813
- I'm kinda beat, let's
do it another time.

09:57.531 --> 10:00.781
(soft chillstep music)

10:05.427 --> 10:09.060
- Are you really gonna play it like this?

10:09.060 --> 10:10.410
- Like what?

10:10.410 --> 10:11.920
- I'm gonna have my own work

10:11.920 --> 10:14.470
and I'll be traveling every week.

10:14.470 --> 10:16.970
I'm not just gonna rush
down here to work for you.

10:18.300 --> 10:19.150
- Did I say that?

10:24.958 --> 10:27.541
(Collin sighs)

10:42.520 --> 10:44.520
Can you blame me for being disappointed?

10:46.530 --> 10:49.680
You know, I actually
like working with you.

10:49.680 --> 10:51.270
I like spending time with you.

10:51.270 --> 10:53.313
I like having you around all the time.

11:07.323 --> 11:10.077
(Collin sighs)

11:10.077 --> 11:12.577
- It's hard to tell sometimes.

11:13.540 --> 11:14.990
- How can it be hard to tell?

11:16.080 --> 11:20.100
- Because you never say
anything and I don't know,

11:20.100 --> 11:22.660
sometimes, it feels like we're just going

11:22.660 --> 11:23.648
and working and--
- What do you mean

11:23.648 --> 11:24.481
say anything?

11:24.481 --> 11:25.314
What do I have to say?

11:25.314 --> 11:30.314
I show you everything with
how much I'm invested in you.

11:30.540 --> 11:32.630
I mean, why should I have to say something

11:32.630 --> 11:37.463
when my actions speak for everything?

11:39.261 --> 11:41.870
- I realize this is an adjustment.

11:41.870 --> 11:43.153
I do.

11:43.153 --> 11:44.533
- (sighs) I know.

11:45.980 --> 11:47.693
Just feeling sorry for myself.

11:48.722 --> 11:51.923
- Aw, is Mr. Cool Photography
Man gonna miss me?

11:53.159 --> 11:54.700
(Collin sighs)

11:54.700 --> 11:55.640
Where are you going?

11:55.640 --> 11:57.940
- You know, I don't
deserve to be fucked with.

11:59.490 --> 12:01.370
This is a big change.

12:01.370 --> 12:03.023
- This isn't easy for me either.

12:15.560 --> 12:16.660
Can we make this work?

12:18.243 --> 12:19.076
- Yeah.

12:29.861 --> 12:32.050
All right, I need to upload the photos.

12:32.050 --> 12:33.310
- Now?

12:33.310 --> 12:34.460
- I should get it done.

12:35.540 --> 12:36.373
- Okay.

12:38.520 --> 12:39.353
I love you.

12:42.018 --> 12:46.300
- I love you too.

12:46.300 --> 12:49.410
- I mean, we've looked at
rings, he knows what I like,

12:49.410 --> 12:53.070
but I think he wants to be a
little more financially stable.

12:53.070 --> 12:54.690
And because of school,
I don't think he wants

12:54.690 --> 12:56.290
to be married and long distance.

12:58.940 --> 13:00.620
- He's probably right.

13:00.620 --> 13:01.453
It's better for you to focus

13:01.453 --> 13:03.020
on your career right now anyway.

13:06.070 --> 13:08.650
You and Collin, you're a thing.

13:08.650 --> 13:09.483
There's no rush.

13:09.483 --> 13:12.097
I'm sure he just wants it
to be the right moment.

13:12.097 --> 13:13.550
I mean, you're not pregnant.

13:13.550 --> 13:15.330
- (laughs) Maybe that's it.

13:15.330 --> 13:17.310
Maybe I should just pull the goalie.

13:17.310 --> 13:18.680
- He's a stand-up guy.

13:18.680 --> 13:20.260
He'd do the right thing.
- He would.

13:20.260 --> 13:22.200
Is that how you trick a
millennial into proposing?

into making a commitment.

13:26.080 --> 13:27.280

13:27.280 --> 13:28.643
- Hey, Joey.
- Hey.

13:30.076 --> 13:30.909
How's it going?

13:30.909 --> 13:32.160
- [Kate] Good.

13:32.160 --> 13:34.130
- I saw the pictures you
posted from your trip.

13:34.130 --> 13:35.330
They look incredible.

13:35.330 --> 13:36.163
- Thanks.

13:36.163 --> 13:37.644
Joey, this is Erin.

13:37.644 --> 13:39.060
- Nice to meet you.
- It's nice meeting you.

13:39.060 --> 13:40.400
- Joey and I met a couple years ago

13:40.400 --> 13:41.410
through a friend of a friend

13:41.410 --> 13:43.560
who is kind of a big
shot in Hollywood now.

13:43.560 --> 13:45.410
- Doing what I can, doing what I can.

13:46.650 --> 13:48.560
So, I don't see a ring.

13:48.560 --> 13:51.410
What, no proposal on this epic vacation?

13:51.410 --> 13:53.350
- We were just talking about this.

13:53.350 --> 13:56.060
- Well, you guys have
been together for a while.

13:56.060 --> 13:57.959
I'm sure it's gonna happen soon.

13:57.959 --> 14:00.327
- It'll happen when it happens.

14:01.530 --> 14:02.960
- So, Joey, what do you do?

14:02.960 --> 14:04.440
Are you an actor?

14:04.440 --> 14:05.990
- No, I'm a writer.
- Oh, hmm.

14:06.950 --> 14:08.530
- Yeah, yeah.
- Very cool.

14:08.530 --> 14:10.769
- It is very cool.
- Yeah, what kind of,

14:10.769 --> 14:12.436
what kind of stuff do you write?

15:49.810 --> 15:51.360

15:51.360 --> 15:52.860
- Of course, it's my pleasure.

15:55.330 --> 15:56.430
Can I show you around?

15:57.900 --> 15:58.733
- Sure.

16:06.290 --> 16:07.890
- I've been fixing the place up.

16:09.970 --> 16:11.410
- Looks good.

16:11.410 --> 16:13.400
- I got a grant to restore the exterior

'cause it's in an historic neighborhood.

16:16.250 --> 16:17.980

16:17.980 --> 16:18.813
- Not yet. (chuckles)

16:18.813 --> 16:20.800
I just finished grad school.

16:20.800 --> 16:23.720
Now, I gotta pass this
test so I've been studying.

16:23.720 --> 16:25.483
But I'm so done with academia.

16:27.160 --> 16:29.570
- Yeah, I didn't finish college.

16:29.570 --> 16:30.403
Kate did.

16:30.403 --> 16:31.293
She's all about education.

16:31.293 --> 16:34.093
- They say it's the only thing
truly worth investing in.

16:38.280 --> 16:39.580
- How's it going out here?

16:40.470 --> 16:41.303
- Good.
- Good.

16:42.350 --> 16:44.380
- Can you give me a hand with this bag?

16:44.380 --> 16:45.213
- Sure.
- Thanks.

16:45.213 --> 16:46.373
- Did you need my help too?

16:47.410 --> 16:48.560
- I think I can manage.

16:52.360 --> 16:53.903
- Thanks for helping me move.

16:56.770 --> 16:58.783
- He's not exactly how you described him.

16:58.783 --> 17:00.260
- What do you mean?

17:00.260 --> 17:01.983
- Well, he's definitely nerdy.

17:03.220 --> 17:06.023
But he looks like a
fucking underwear model.

17:06.023 --> 17:07.773
- (chuckles) I don't really see it.

17:08.849 --> 17:10.180
Is someone feeling threatened?

17:10.180 --> 17:12.030
- You're telling me nerdy bookworm,

17:12.030 --> 17:14.030
I'm seeing a guy that
makes more money than me

17:14.030 --> 17:16.053
and spends all day in a fucking plank.

17:16.990 --> 17:18.859
- [Kate] He doesn't make
more money than you.

17:18.859 --> 17:19.900
He's still unemployed.

17:19.900 --> 17:21.373
- He owns real estate.

17:22.270 --> 17:23.730
In San Francisco.

17:23.730 --> 17:25.430
- Why don't we hang out with him

17:25.430 --> 17:27.980
and you can get to know him better?

17:27.980 --> 17:29.440
I think if you spend some time with him

17:29.440 --> 17:31.720
you'll (chuckling) see what I mean.

17:31.720 --> 17:33.173
- Mm, okay.

17:34.880 --> 17:35.950
Did I mention that while you're gone,

17:35.950 --> 17:38.130
I'm hosting that Colombian
bikini model that we shot?

17:38.130 --> 17:39.620
- No, you didn't mention that.

17:39.620 --> 17:41.847
- I am.
- Got nothing to worry about.

school that you applied to.

19:49.721 --> 19:50.840
It's not a question anymore

19:50.840 --> 19:52.863
of whether or not you're a good designer.

19:53.866 --> 19:56.680
- Yeah, but--
- Listen.

19:56.680 --> 19:58.603
You have an amazing eye.

20:00.090 --> 20:01.083
I know this.

20:14.053 --> 20:15.886

won't just come with me.

21:03.800 --> 21:06.120
You're not working the next three days.

21:06.120 --> 21:08.100
I could really use the

21:08.100 --> 21:10.920
to spend some actual time
together, don't you think?

21:10.920 --> 21:13.320
- I have a ton of editing to do.

21:13.320 --> 21:15.280
- [Kate] Yeah, you can edit anywhere.

21:15.280 --> 21:18.343
- I can edit anywhere, but not well.

21:19.650 --> 21:22.550
Sitting in a stranger's
living room on a laptop

21:22.550 --> 21:23.963
is not ideal for me.

21:25.150 --> 21:26.360
And I have a shoot next week.

21:26.360 --> 21:28.668
I don't wanna be run-down from the travel.

21:28.668 --> 21:30.320
- Run-down?

21:30.320 --> 21:32.200
I'm tired too, Collin.

21:32.200 --> 21:34.070
I'm going to school, working.

21:34.070 --> 21:35.610
It's tiring.

21:35.610 --> 21:37.250
- It doesn't make sense for me

21:37.250 --> 21:38.850
because you have a plane ticket

21:38.850 --> 21:40.950
and I would have to drive back and forth

21:40.950 --> 21:42.856
both ways by myself and I
- I can cancel the flight

21:42.856 --> 21:44.200

- and drive up with you.

21:44.200 --> 21:45.890
- and go straight to a shoot.

21:45.890 --> 21:47.300
- It's only five hours.

21:47.300 --> 21:49.513
- Six, with no traffic.

coming up every weekend.

21:57.200 --> 21:58.103

21:58.960 --> 21:59.793
- Okay.

22:01.270 --> 22:02.160
- This is what you wanted.

22:02.160 --> 22:03.973
I told you it wasn't gonna be easy.

22:04.860 --> 22:05.743
- I understand.

22:07.880 --> 22:09.570
- I wanna spend time with you, but--

22:09.570 --> 22:11.050
- It's fine.

22:11.050 --> 22:11.883
I get it.

22:12.750 --> 22:13.970

22:31.675 --> 22:33.853

Good job today.

fuck it up, didn't you?

always that exciting.

25:31.900 --> 25:34.720

27:30.025 --> 27:31.930
(both chuckling)

27:31.930 --> 27:32.763
No, really.

27:32.763 --> 27:34.760
Thank you for connecting us again.

27:34.760 --> 27:36.010
- Well, it makes my life a lot easier

27:36.010 --> 27:37.810
when he has someone he likes to work with.

27:37.810 --> 27:39.613
- Your classes, how are they coming?

27:40.450 --> 27:42.640
- Going back and forth
is getting a little old.

27:42.640 --> 27:43.513
- I'm sure.

27:44.690 --> 27:46.140
- But I'm here all weekend.

27:46.140 --> 27:47.400
We should hang out.

27:47.400 --> 27:49.140
I've never met your man.

27:49.140 --> 27:51.400
- We broke up a couple of weeks ago.

27:51.400 --> 27:54.070
- Oh, really, I'm so sorry to hear that.

27:54.070 --> 27:57.253
- Yeah, it sucks, but I
think it's a good thing.

27:58.260 --> 27:59.363
- Breakups are tough.

28:00.240 --> 28:02.100
- Everything happens for a reason

28:02.100 --> 28:04.730
and it's been nice to have some time

28:04.730 --> 28:05.723
to focus on work.

28:06.640 --> 28:07.740
- Alex!

28:07.740 --> 28:09.453
Can I get that bounce back in?

28:10.610 --> 28:13.473
- Duty calls.
(Kate chuckles)

28:14.818 --> 28:17.030
(contemplative music)

28:17.030 --> 28:18.870
- These engagement things are tough.

28:18.870 --> 28:21.522
- He didn't really understand
the concept of smile.

28:21.522 --> 28:23.420
(Collin chuckles)

28:23.420 --> 28:26.380
- I think I'm gonna have to
start turning these down.

28:26.380 --> 28:28.973
- Did it at least come out all right?

28:31.191 --> 28:33.425
- [Collin] They're okay.

28:33.425 --> 28:35.592
I think she looks natural.

28:37.958 --> 28:41.541
(Collin and Alex laughing)

28:50.240 --> 28:52.150
- You guys need any help?

28:52.150 --> 28:52.983
- [Collin] We got it.

28:52.983 --> 28:54.160
- [Alex] It's your weekend, girl.

28:54.160 --> 28:55.340
You relax.

28:55.340 --> 28:56.440
- [Kate] Are you sure?

28:57.690 --> 29:00.050
- Yeah, enjoy the view.

29:00.050 --> 29:02.329
- You're not getting paid
to lug this shit around.

29:02.329 --> 29:04.360
(chuckles) Lucky you.

29:04.360 --> 29:06.305
Off to the glamorous world of fashion.

29:06.305 --> 29:08.632
(Kate chuckles)

29:08.632 --> 29:11.093
- Like dumplings or beef and--
- All good?

29:12.460 --> 29:14.134
- Yeah, that should do it.

29:14.134 --> 29:15.520
- It was good to see you.

29:16.910 --> 29:18.760
- Have fun with the rest
of your time down here.

29:18.760 --> 29:20.090
- Thanks.

29:20.090 --> 29:21.240
- Wanna go have drinks?

29:23.180 --> 29:25.480
- I'm not sure if I'm
feeling up to it, sorry.

29:26.530 --> 29:28.023
- I actually have plans.

29:30.430 --> 29:32.580
- All right, well, see
you on the next one.

29:34.670 --> 29:35.503
Mm.

29:37.620 --> 29:39.390
This place is really good.

29:39.390 --> 29:40.223
- Yeah.

29:44.095 --> 29:46.941
So, how do you think it went today?

29:46.941 --> 29:47.941
- All right.

29:49.077 --> 29:51.950
I'm getting really tired
of these engagement shoots.

29:51.950 --> 29:53.140
- Yeah.

29:53.140 --> 29:55.840
Well, maybe it's time to
focus more on editorial work.

29:57.990 --> 29:58.823
- We'll see.

30:02.920 --> 30:04.420
So, what are we doing tonight?

30:06.211 --> 30:07.400
- I kinda wanted to stay in.

30:07.400 --> 30:09.203
I haven't been home in a while.

30:12.840 --> 30:15.540
Then again, we could give your
drinking buddy Alex a call,

30:15.540 --> 30:16.713
see what she's up to.

30:22.580 --> 30:24.343
- My drinking buddy Alex?

30:25.570 --> 30:27.170
- Yeah.

30:27.170 --> 30:29.770
- You mean the girl that
you replaced yourself with.

30:31.150 --> 30:33.080
- Seems like you two are pretty chummy.

30:33.080 --> 30:34.943
- Are you jealous?

30:36.002 --> 30:37.560
- It's hard.

30:37.560 --> 30:39.093
It's hard for me to see.

30:40.610 --> 30:44.380
I'm just alone in San
Francisco, like, working,

30:44.380 --> 30:47.870
and you're just getting
drinks all the time, you know,

30:47.870 --> 30:49.580
with (scoffs) my friend.

30:49.580 --> 30:52.360
- Hello, what about old Charles?

30:52.360 --> 30:53.670
Old Charlie Boy?

30:53.670 --> 30:55.060
- There's no drinking going on

30:55.060 --> 30:56.930
with old (chuckling) Charlie Boy.

30:56.930 --> 30:57.763
- That's sad.

30:57.763 --> 31:00.913
You should get the guy
out, let him live a little.

31:02.110 --> 31:04.320
- I have a hard time
believing that if I would say,

31:04.320 --> 31:07.470
oh, just going out with
Charlie for some drinks,

31:07.470 --> 31:11.130
that you'd be like, oh,
cool, sounds, have fun.

31:11.130 --> 31:12.230
- I mean, I've met him.

31:12.230 --> 31:14.010
Yeah, I would, I would encourage it.

31:14.010 --> 31:15.800
He needs a little life.

31:15.800 --> 31:17.793
- Okay, that's how you wanna play it.

31:19.990 --> 31:21.430
So, are you really good to stay in

31:21.430 --> 31:23.830
or you need to go and live your life?

31:23.830 --> 31:25.253
- Yeah, yeah.

31:25.253 --> 31:27.320
I'm perfectly fine with watching a movie

31:27.320 --> 31:28.470
or something like that.

31:29.507 --> 31:34.507
- [Man] Made clear that there
are no. (speaking faintly)

31:37.530 --> 31:39.820
do not understand the
concept of wilderness.

31:41.051 --> 31:43.401
- Wanna just turn it off
and talk for a minute?

31:45.110 --> 31:46.810
- You're literally gonna
be asleep in a second

31:46.810 --> 31:49.534
so then I'll be lying here in the dark.

31:49.534 --> 31:50.484
- Aren't you tired?

31:51.460 --> 31:52.293
- Not really.

31:53.840 --> 31:55.240
- Can I at least lay on you?

31:56.490 --> 32:00.593
- Sure.

I haven't looked at it
too much, and the effect,

32:07.434 --> 32:10.225
because, you now, it's
not a great match-up

32:10.225 --> 32:12.077

Leave your name and number

(voicemail beeps)
- Hey, it's me.

33:13.540 --> 33:15.940
Just wondering what you're doing.

33:15.940 --> 33:19.160
Would love to hear from
you at some point today,

33:19.160 --> 33:20.993
so call me.

33:22.630 --> 33:23.463
Love you.

33:24.770 --> 33:26.950
I'm staying here a lot
more than half a week.

33:26.950 --> 33:29.690
- It's good to have
someone like you around.

33:29.690 --> 33:31.360
- [Kate] Well, it's hard to cook for one.

33:31.360 --> 33:32.610
- Yeah, I know.

33:33.567 --> 33:35.317
- What do you mean someone like me?

33:37.330 --> 33:38.880
- You're pleasant to be around.

33:39.940 --> 33:42.820
- Pleasant. (chuckles)

33:42.820 --> 33:45.170
Not something you hear
often, but I'll take it.

33:46.010 --> 33:47.360
- I meant it in a good way.

33:48.620 --> 33:50.820
And I know how expensive
being a student is.

33:53.700 --> 33:56.000
So, how come you've been
staying up here more?

33:56.980 --> 33:59.730
- Mm, it's just too hard to go
back and forth every weekend.

33:59.730 --> 34:01.260
Plus, Collin found someone to help him

34:01.260 --> 34:04.240
so there's less pressure
for me to go down.

34:04.240 --> 34:05.100

Gives you more time for your studies.

Are you okay not seeing him as much?

34:12.483 --> 34:14.989
I mean, I know you guys
have the two-week rule.

34:14.989 --> 34:16.389
It seems to be working well.

34:17.230 --> 34:18.810
- It's fine.

34:18.810 --> 34:19.810
I have a break soon.

34:26.409 --> 34:28.610
Thank you.

- I love this varietal.

34:31.679 --> 34:32.513

34:33.600 --> 34:36.420
- I got it last summer
in Napa with my family.

34:36.420 --> 34:37.253
- What's it called?

34:37.253 --> 34:38.085
- Barbera?

34:38.085 --> 34:39.003
Bar, Barbara?

34:40.710 --> 34:42.483
- You sure about that?

34:42.483 --> 34:44.068
- (chuckling) Yeah.

34:44.068 --> 34:45.217
That's how they say it.

34:46.440 --> 34:47.710
Well, what is it then?

34:47.710 --> 34:49.120
- Barbera.

34:49.120 --> 34:51.580
- You like it?
- I do, it's great.

34:51.580 --> 34:53.219
It's very full-bodied.

34:53.219 --> 34:54.870
- Yeah, little hints of oak.

34:54.870 --> 34:56.253
You get the oak?
- Mm-hmm.

35:02.552 --> 35:03.385
Hey.

35:04.540 --> 35:06.350
- Hey, is everything okay?

35:06.350 --> 35:07.960
- Yeah, why?

35:07.960 --> 35:09.760
- You called me four times in a row.

35:09.760 --> 35:11.410
I thought you knew I was working.

35:11.410 --> 35:12.690
- Yeah, how's it going?

35:12.690 --> 35:14.010
- [Alex] The guy from the studio says

35:14.010 --> 35:16.730
if we're not out of here in
five, he's gonna charge us.

35:16.730 --> 35:18.960
- Give me a minute.
- Who's that?

35:18.960 --> 35:20.330
- Alex.

35:20.330 --> 35:21.163
Can I call you later?

35:21.163 --> 35:22.390
We still have to break down.

35:23.720 --> 35:25.300
- Yeah, but I feel like
I haven't really gotten

35:25.300 --> 35:26.690
to talk to you today.
(trunk thuds)

35:26.690 --> 35:28.700
- I don't think you have
any reason to be upset.

35:28.700 --> 35:31.180
You're the one that made the
decision not to come down.

35:31.180 --> 35:32.430
- Well, I'm sorry, I didn't feel

35:32.430 --> 35:33.570
like standing around all day,

35:33.570 --> 35:35.510
watching you and Alex work your magic.

35:35.510 --> 35:37.520

35:37.520 --> 35:38.710
- What?

35:38.710 --> 35:39.990
- Have you been drinking?

35:39.990 --> 35:41.100
- [Kate] No.

35:41.100 --> 35:42.237
Some wine with dinner.

35:44.520 --> 35:45.353
- I'll call you later.

35:45.353 --> 35:47.737
We have to get out of the studio, okay?

35:47.737 --> 35:49.071

36:40.990 --> 36:43.810
- Basically, if anybody comes up to us,

36:43.810 --> 36:45.188
you'd have to talk about how great I am.

37:06.410 --> 37:07.633
- I wanna do something.

37:08.990 --> 37:10.090
- [Charles] Like what?

37:11.170 --> 37:13.793
- I wanna drink and dance.

37:15.380 --> 37:17.820
- (chuckling) You enjoy yourself.

37:17.820 --> 37:19.772
- You're coming.

37:19.772 --> 37:20.605

37:22.920 --> 37:24.453
- The book will still be here.

37:28.510 --> 37:29.460
Where are we going?

37:30.770 --> 37:32.960
- I don't do a lot of dancing

37:32.960 --> 37:35.260
but I have a couple ideas.

37:35.260 --> 37:36.280
- Great.

were fucking around on me.

had some fucking intuition

55:04.130 --> 55:05.200

never going to forgive me,

then maybe we should just break up.

Yeah, just give up that easily.

make this whole experience

55:58.230 --> 56:00.090

56:00.090 --> 56:01.110
It could've been easy,

56:01.110 --> 56:02.810
but instead, it was completely up to me

56:02.810 --> 56:04.500
to maintain the status
of our relationship.

56:04.500 --> 56:06.887
- That's all just speculation.

56:06.887 --> 56:09.930
And it doesn't justify the fact

56:09.930 --> 56:12.780
that you fucked someone else.

56:12.780 --> 56:14.862
And when are you gonna take
responsibility for that, huh?

56:14.862 --> 56:16.267
It's that simple!
- I'm not trying

56:16.267 --> 56:17.445
to justify it, okay?

56:17.445 --> 56:18.553
I'm just trying to explain and tell you

56:18.553 --> 56:20.270
that I felt completely alone

56:20.270 --> 56:21.580
and like it was all up to me.

56:21.580 --> 56:24.190
You were just going on
about your life without me.

56:24.190 --> 56:25.240

56:26.630 --> 56:28.570
You're right, (stammering) I can't.

56:28.570 --> 56:31.710
I can't forgive you right now.

56:31.710 --> 56:32.840
- Right now, or ever?

56:32.840 --> 56:33.673
- I don't know.

56:38.290 --> 56:40.340
- This doesn't feel right.

56:41.840 --> 56:45.946

we should take a break.

- I don't want that.

I want our life back.

58:02.484 --> 58:03.734
- [Patrick] Well, I will.

58:04.700 --> 58:05.533
- Sorry.

58:06.740 --> 58:07.773
Got any jacks?

58:10.330 --> 58:11.730
- How do you always do that?

58:16.360 --> 58:18.777
(Kate sighs)

58:22.450 --> 58:23.783
What's going on, babe?

58:26.434 --> 58:27.684
- (sighing) I don't know.

58:31.100 --> 58:32.750
- Have you heard from him at all?

58:34.730 --> 58:35.563
- Nope.

58:36.814 --> 58:38.214
And I don't think I'm gonna.

58:48.740 --> 58:51.313
- Hey, let's get outta here.

58:52.670 --> 58:53.870
You're gonna win anyway.

58:56.600 --> 58:57.433
- Okay.

58:59.910 --> 59:00.743
- Mother.

59:02.200 --> 59:03.233
We're leaving.

59:04.740 --> 59:05.573
Here.

59:05.573 --> 59:06.467
(soft music)
- Yeah.

59:06.467 --> 59:07.300
- [Woman] Was it Quaker?

59:07.300 --> 59:08.358
- It was a apple shake.

59:08.358 --> 59:11.941
(man and woman chattering)

59:19.460 --> 59:21.260
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah, dude.

59:25.767 --> 59:27.365
I know you wanna go talk to them.

59:27.365 --> 59:30.446
- Golf cart and golf course.
(women chattering)

59:30.446 --> 59:31.458
- I really need a drink first.

59:32.307 --> 59:33.862
- Okay.

- (chuckling) I'm aware.

01:00:18.290 --> 01:00:20.340

- Well, Katie, these things don't happen

01:00:39.180 --> 01:00:42.773
because you're both happy,
because everything's fine.

01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:44.753
Look.

01:00:45.750 --> 01:00:50.510
I love Collin, but he's been
noncommittal since day one.

01:00:50.510 --> 01:00:53.363
I mean, he kind of only
thinks about himself.

01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:56.540
- Yeah, you're right.

01:00:56.540 --> 01:00:58.240
He's basically put zero effort

01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:00.140
into our relationship this whole year.

01:01:01.530 --> 01:01:04.430
And a lot of our friends are
getting engaged or married,

01:01:04.430 --> 01:01:07.030
and anytime I bring it up,
he completely shuts down.

01:01:09.660 --> 01:01:10.970
- You know, he's one of those guys

01:01:10.970 --> 01:01:13.150
that's really into his work.

01:01:13.150 --> 01:01:14.250
It's what you like about him,

01:01:14.250 --> 01:01:16.250
it's what makes him interesting,

01:01:16.250 --> 01:01:17.733
but it's not conventional.

01:01:19.150 --> 01:01:21.370
I mean, you've known that the whole time.

01:01:21.370 --> 01:01:24.130
Look, the whole brooding
artist thing, it's hot

01:01:24.130 --> 01:01:25.710
but it's...

01:01:26.770 --> 01:01:28.300
You can't expect the
same things out of him

01:01:28.300 --> 01:01:30.200
that's happening for all your friends.

01:01:31.540 --> 01:01:32.373
- He is moody.

01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:35.160
And a little pretentious sometimes.

01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:37.620
- He is by far the moodiest heterosexual

01:01:37.620 --> 01:01:39.684
I ever hung out with.

01:01:43.390 --> 01:01:45.330
- Yeah.
- You guys are good together

01:01:45.330 --> 01:01:47.960
but it seems like you are
going in this direction

01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:49.633
and he's not getting on board.

01:01:50.610 --> 01:01:52.690
You've been together for a super long time

01:01:52.690 --> 01:01:55.500
so you're just at this
point where it's like,

01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:56.640
you know, what's next?

01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:59.353
But Katie, you have to do
what's gonna make you happy.

01:02:01.024 --> 01:02:02.670
I mean, this is your dream.

01:02:02.670 --> 01:02:05.443
He's gotta understand that
if you wanna make it work.

01:02:07.490 --> 01:02:10.200
- Yeah, but at the end of
the day, I still fucked up.

01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:11.910
It's my fault.

01:02:11.910 --> 01:02:12.790
I mean, how long would it take you

01:02:12.790 --> 01:02:13.950
to get over something like that?

01:02:13.950 --> 01:02:16.530
- I know, I know, but
you see what I'm saying.

01:02:16.530 --> 01:02:17.790
- [Kate] I do.

01:02:17.790 --> 01:02:19.820
- Seriously, it was one time, okay?

01:02:19.820 --> 01:02:23.640
And you told him about it
right away and you ended it.

01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:25.600
- I know, but it still happened

01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:29.000
and I don't wanna diminish that

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.600
because he really is hurt by it.

01:02:31.950 --> 01:02:34.640
- I get that, it just, it
seems like you are really hurt

01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:37.650
by the way he's been treating
you the last nine months.

01:02:37.650 --> 01:02:42.197
Whatever you do, whatever
happens, I'm here for you.

01:02:43.293 --> 01:02:45.893
I just don't wanna see you
give up on what you want.

01:02:52.016 --> 01:02:53.119
(Kate sighs)

01:02:53.119 --> 01:02:54.563
- Fuck.
- That's all.

01:02:56.770 --> 01:02:58.670
- Are you with me here?

01:02:58.670 --> 01:02:59.890
- Yeah.

01:02:59.890 --> 01:03:01.540
- Look, I know that you're down right now.

01:03:01.540 --> 01:03:03.860
I just, you gotta remember

01:03:03.860 --> 01:03:06.350
that you didn't do
anything wrong, all right?

01:03:06.350 --> 01:03:08.200
Look, the situation that you're in,

01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:10.000
you can't beat yourself up about it.

01:03:10.910 --> 01:03:12.750
- It's more complicated than that.

01:03:12.750 --> 01:03:15.830
- Look, we all love her, all right?

01:03:15.830 --> 01:03:17.793
Kate is a great girl.

01:03:19.060 --> 01:03:20.830
But she fucked up.

01:03:20.830 --> 01:03:22.640
So, you don't have
anything to be sad about.

01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:24.009
If anything, you should be angry.

01:03:24.009 --> 01:03:25.550
- (clears throat) I am.

01:03:25.550 --> 01:03:26.933
- No, I know, dude, I know.

01:03:28.710 --> 01:03:30.510
I want you to try to have fun, okay?

01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:32.673
- I am.

01:03:35.330 --> 01:03:36.210
- Really?

01:03:36.210 --> 01:03:38.063
This is your I'm-having-fun face?

01:03:38.965 --> 01:03:41.100
Whew, man, okay.

01:03:41.100 --> 01:03:42.410
All right, well...
(Collin sighs)

01:03:42.410 --> 01:03:44.050
- Dude, it's not that easy.

01:03:44.050 --> 01:03:44.883
- No, no, no.

01:03:44.883 --> 01:03:45.716

01:04:13.787 --> 01:04:15.360
- It's coming along in here.

01:04:16.450 --> 01:04:17.530
We're gonna get drinks around the corner.

01:04:17.530 --> 01:04:18.363
You wanna come?

01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:20.910
- I think I'm gonna finish unpacking.

01:04:20.910 --> 01:04:22.110
Thanks, though.

01:04:22.110 --> 01:04:24.240

while if you change your mind.

01:11:22.410 --> 01:11:25.060
- I, uh, (clears throat)

01:11:25.060 --> 01:11:29.893
I end up just missing Kate even more.

01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:36.620
- I wish Megan was awake

01:11:36.620 --> 01:11:37.690
to talk to you, man.
(Collin laughing)

01:11:37.690 --> 01:11:40.357
(both laughing)

01:11:42.105 --> 01:11:43.420
- Dude, you're good enough, man.

01:11:43.420 --> 01:11:44.253
How is she, though?

01:11:44.253 --> 01:11:45.700
Is she good?
- She's fine, she's good.

01:11:45.700 --> 01:11:47.033
She's, you know, busy.

01:11:48.450 --> 01:11:49.283
- Busy's good.

01:11:53.240 --> 01:11:55.643
- Do you remember what
happened when we broke up?

01:11:59.050 --> 01:12:00.400
- Not specifically, no.
- Well, okay.

01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:02.030
We were in a very serious argument

01:12:02.030 --> 01:12:06.000
because I would vanish for work trips,

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:09.260
as she would put it, out of
range, and she was right.

01:12:09.260 --> 01:12:12.693
I mean, I would disappear,
just check out for a few days.

01:12:14.700 --> 01:12:16.000
Anyway, I thought about it

01:12:17.030 --> 01:12:20.400
and I heard from her point of view

01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:22.100
and I tried to imagine what it'd be like

01:12:22.100 --> 01:12:25.370
if she were the one that was out of range.

01:12:25.370 --> 01:12:26.773
I changed my tune.

01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:29.270
- Hmm.

01:12:29.270 --> 01:12:31.380
- I did, I had to eat crow

01:12:31.380 --> 01:12:33.720
and recognize that I had contributed

01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:35.973
to the space that was between us.

01:12:37.700 --> 01:12:39.093
- Yeah, I mean, that's,

01:12:40.446 --> 01:12:42.814
that's a lot. (chuckles)

01:12:42.814 --> 01:12:44.560
That's a lot.

01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:45.633
- More simply put,

01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:48.140
it is my medical opinion

01:12:48.140 --> 01:12:50.653
that strange will not cure your condition.

01:12:53.660 --> 01:12:55.282
You have to talk to Kate.

01:12:55.282 --> 01:12:57.865
(somber music)

01:13:01.436 --> 01:13:02.759
(liquid sloshing)

01:13:02.759 --> 01:13:06.179
I set you up on the couch if you need it.

01:13:06.179 --> 01:13:07.012
Come on.

01:13:08.801 --> 01:13:11.468
(glasses clink)

01:13:18.346 --> 01:13:20.638
(women giggling)

01:13:20.638 --> 01:13:22.060
- [Erin] I was hoping, yup.

01:13:22.060 --> 01:13:22.893
- [Sam] That's amazing.

01:13:22.893 --> 01:13:24.770
- Okay, wait, wait,
wait, we can do better.

01:13:25.620 --> 01:13:26.460
How about this guy?

01:13:26.460 --> 01:13:29.810
Nick, 29, pictured with his dog.

01:13:29.810 --> 01:13:30.643
- He's cute.

01:13:30.643 --> 01:13:33.560
- Oh, we got her with
that dog profile pic.

01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:35.630
- I wanna meet someone organically.

01:13:35.630 --> 01:13:37.930
- Brian, 31, head of digital marketing.

01:13:37.930 --> 01:13:38.853
Funny caption.

01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:41.280
- I'm not driving to Long Beach.

01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:43.170
- [Sam] Parameters.

01:13:43.170 --> 01:13:45.770
- Don't you think it's
a little demoralizing

01:13:45.770 --> 01:13:48.830
to date solely based on a few photos

01:13:48.830 --> 01:13:51.210
and a self-constructed
idea of who they are

01:13:51.210 --> 01:13:53.160
based on age and proximity?

01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:55.000
- Mostly proximity.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:56.530
- It's completely demoralizing

01:13:56.530 --> 01:13:58.730
but it's also a good way to find out

01:13:58.730 --> 01:14:00.400
what you like and what you don't.

01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:01.642
- Within a five-mile radius.

01:14:01.642 --> 01:14:02.750
- Well, yeah, of course.

01:14:02.750 --> 01:14:04.590
- Besides, Kate, where have you been?

01:14:04.590 --> 01:14:06.133
This is how people meet now.

01:14:07.220 --> 01:14:10.563
Chris, 22, went as King
Baby for Halloween.

01:14:11.890 --> 01:14:13.080
- I'm not feeling the apps.

01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:17.620
- I hear your organic
argument, but this is it.

01:14:17.620 --> 01:14:19.367
Everyone does it while
they complain about it.

01:14:19.367 --> 01:14:21.063
It's just a part of life.

01:14:21.063 --> 01:14:23.300
- Yeah, but if you wanna
meet someone organically,

01:14:23.300 --> 01:14:25.010
you should move to a small town.

01:14:25.010 --> 01:14:26.440
- Oh no.

01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:27.330
You think this is bad?

01:14:27.330 --> 01:14:28.830
Wait until you come across Collin on there

01:14:28.830 --> 01:14:32.096
and forget it.

01:14:32.096 --> 01:14:32.930
I...

01:14:32.930 --> 01:14:35.059
- Yeah.
- Downer?

01:14:35.059 --> 01:14:36.867
(all chuckling)

01:14:36.867 --> 01:14:39.450
(somber music)

01:14:48.180 --> 01:14:50.330
- This guy, I'm gonna rip him apart

01:14:50.330 --> 01:14:52.620
no matter what's being read.
(diners chattering)

01:14:52.620 --> 01:14:54.010
And this is the opposite.

01:14:54.010 --> 01:14:55.640
Like I said, it's all
people, different ages,

01:14:55.640 --> 01:14:58.184
different groups, different whatever.

01:14:58.184 --> 01:15:00.150
Yeah, it's a beautiful thing.

01:15:00.150 --> 01:15:01.972
It's every Saturday.

01:15:01.972 --> 01:15:02.805
Like I said, I.

01:15:02.805 --> 01:15:04.750
Well, I gotta say, I'm really glad

01:15:04.750 --> 01:15:07.220
that we could finally get together.

01:15:07.220 --> 01:15:08.380
You know, I always thought
you should be with a guy

01:15:08.380 --> 01:15:09.824
that's crazy about you.

01:15:09.824 --> 01:15:11.360
(Kate chuckles)

01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:12.510
- Thanks.

01:15:12.510 --> 01:15:13.660
This was fun.

01:15:13.660 --> 01:15:14.710
- Yeah?

01:15:14.710 --> 01:15:15.630
- Yeah.

01:15:15.630 --> 01:15:16.463
- Cool.

01:15:17.650 --> 01:15:20.230
You sure you don't wanna
grab another drink somewhere?

01:15:20.230 --> 01:15:22.730
- It's tempting but I have
this thing I have to go to.

01:15:22.730 --> 01:15:23.800
- A thing?

01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:24.633
- Mm-hmm.

01:15:24.633 --> 01:15:25.466
- Well, that's vague.

01:15:25.466 --> 01:15:27.730
What are you, double-dipping tonight?

01:15:27.730 --> 01:15:29.500
Got another date lined up after me?

01:15:29.500 --> 01:15:31.740
Trying to maximize your time?
(Kate laughing)

01:15:31.740 --> 01:15:33.797
- No, it's an art show for a photographer

01:15:33.797 --> 01:15:34.630
I used to work with.
- This is me.

01:15:34.630 --> 01:15:35.531
- Oh, okay.

01:15:35.531 --> 01:15:37.339
I'm really just trying to make
an appearance and go home.

01:15:37.339 --> 01:15:38.172
- Ah.

01:15:38.172 --> 01:15:39.235
- Yeah.

01:15:39.235 --> 01:15:40.530
- Well, have fun.

01:15:40.530 --> 01:15:41.363
- Thank you.

01:15:44.797 --> 01:15:46.320
- I'm not gonna kiss you tonight

01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:49.650
'cause, well, I wanted it to be natural

01:15:49.650 --> 01:15:51.462
and maybe a little bit drunker.

01:15:51.462 --> 01:15:54.820
- (laughing) That sounds good.

01:15:54.820 --> 01:15:56.048
- I'll call you.

01:15:56.048 --> 01:15:56.881
- Okay.

01:15:59.256 --> 01:16:01.509
(Kate chuckles)

01:16:01.509 --> 01:16:02.650
- All right.
- Night.

01:16:02.650 --> 01:16:03.888
- Hey, you look beautiful tonight, Kate.

01:16:03.888 --> 01:16:08.367
- (chuckling) Thank you.
(contemplative music)

01:16:19.647 --> 01:16:20.480
- Kate?

01:16:21.849 --> 01:16:22.682
Hey.

01:16:24.690 --> 01:16:25.523
- [Kate] Are you leaving?

01:16:25.523 --> 01:16:27.350
- Yeah, I've been here for a little bit.

01:16:27.350 --> 01:16:28.183
- How is it?

01:16:28.183 --> 01:16:31.480
- Uh, eccentric.
(Kate chuckles)

01:16:31.480 --> 01:16:32.980
How have you been?

01:16:32.980 --> 01:16:34.430
I heard about you and Collin.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.353
He definitely wasn't
himself without you around.

01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:41.780
- Didn't seem that way.

01:16:41.780 --> 01:16:42.990
I basically spent all this year

01:16:42.990 --> 01:16:44.150
between here and San Francisco

01:16:44.150 --> 01:16:46.310
while he worked and went out.

01:16:46.310 --> 01:16:48.401
- He didn't really go out all that much.

01:16:48.401 --> 01:16:49.234
- Mm.

01:16:50.100 --> 01:16:51.710
- Well, half the time,
I would go over there

01:16:51.710 --> 01:16:54.810
and he'd be in his bathrobe,
smoking in the house,

01:16:54.810 --> 01:16:56.123
like an old spinster.

01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:01.300
- Well, it's good to see you.

01:17:01.300 --> 01:17:02.133
- You too.

01:17:04.190 --> 01:17:05.023
Kate?

01:17:05.900 --> 01:17:07.023
Really sorry.

01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:11.953
- Hey, Kate, it's Collin.

01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:17.850
When you get a chance,
give me a call back.

01:17:17.850 --> 01:17:19.100
I hope you're doing well.

01:17:23.967 --> 01:17:27.401
(phone chiming)

01:17:27.401 --> 01:17:29.390
(Collin clears throat)

01:17:29.390 --> 01:17:30.223
Hey.

01:17:33.125 --> 01:17:35.792
(chuckling) Mm.

01:17:38.520 --> 01:17:39.463
I've been a mess.

01:17:42.218 --> 01:17:43.783
- [Kate] I'm sorry to hear that.

01:17:45.329 --> 01:17:46.579
- Where you been staying?

01:17:48.030 --> 01:17:50.830
- Erin had an extra room in her apartment.

01:17:50.830 --> 01:17:51.920
It's nice.

01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:54.090
I'm just a little tired of moving.

01:17:54.090 --> 01:17:58.410
- Remember that time we
moved you out of that house

01:17:58.410 --> 01:18:00.120
into our place? (chuckling)

01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:01.680
- I remember you throwing my mattress

01:18:01.680 --> 01:18:03.174
out the third-floor window, yes.

01:18:03.174 --> 01:18:04.440
(both chuckling)

01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:05.840
- Hey, it worked, didn't it?

01:18:08.580 --> 01:18:09.413
Look.

01:18:12.060 --> 01:18:12.893
I was proud.

01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:19.503
I wanted to act like everything was fine.

01:18:22.150 --> 01:18:23.073
But it wasn't.

01:18:25.270 --> 01:18:28.840
I just felt like you wanted it
to be over with immediately,

01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:30.043
like nothing happened.

01:18:32.509 --> 01:18:34.223
- I wasn't trying to do that.

01:18:36.020 --> 01:18:36.853
- Okay.

01:18:38.397 --> 01:18:41.910
- It felt like, for the first time,

01:18:41.910 --> 01:18:43.453
I wanted to do my own thing.

01:18:44.930 --> 01:18:47.333
And you weren't there for me.

01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:51.360
That has to count for something.

01:18:53.300 --> 01:18:56.390
Obviously, I'm always going
to regret what happened.

01:18:56.390 --> 01:18:58.890
But there were things that
were wrong before that.

01:19:01.270 --> 01:19:02.103
- I hear that.

01:19:03.895 --> 01:19:07.050
- It was completely
unfair and immature of me

01:19:07.050 --> 01:19:09.003
to let that manifest into something.

01:19:10.910 --> 01:19:12.500
I was confused.

01:19:12.500 --> 01:19:14.703
I thought you were
cheating on me with Alex.

01:19:18.663 --> 01:19:21.246
(Collin sighs)

01:19:27.261 --> 01:19:29.928
(Collin groans)

01:19:32.943 --> 01:19:35.526
(Collin sighs)

01:19:39.074 --> 01:19:39.931
(somber music)

01:19:39.931 --> 01:19:43.514
- You know, I really
want this to work out.

01:19:45.020 --> 01:19:46.520
I still have feelings for you.

01:19:49.970 --> 01:19:52.370
But there's a part of
me, I gotta be honest,

01:19:52.370 --> 01:19:56.820
it feels like you're
still just making excuses

01:19:56.820 --> 01:19:59.483
and that you've never really apologized.

01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:02.673
And that you have no regrets.

01:20:03.890 --> 01:20:05.470
- I made a mistake.

01:20:05.470 --> 01:20:07.660
I absolutely think it was wrong.

01:20:07.660 --> 01:20:11.683
I would be so devastated
if the table were turned.

01:20:13.030 --> 01:20:16.010
But it happened and then it was over.

01:20:16.010 --> 01:20:17.470
I didn't carry on.

01:20:17.470 --> 01:20:19.193
I tried to be honest.

01:20:20.450 --> 01:20:23.493
If you wanna be with me,
you have to forgive me.

01:20:29.532 --> 01:20:33.010
When I talked about going back to school,

01:20:33.010 --> 01:20:34.610
I thought you would propose

01:20:35.500 --> 01:20:37.950
or we'd at least talk more
about getting married.

01:20:44.240 --> 01:20:45.490
- Things aren't the same.

01:20:46.970 --> 01:20:47.883
- No, they're not.

01:20:50.860 --> 01:20:52.410
At what point are we gonna move forward

01:20:52.410 --> 01:20:53.560
with our lives, Collin?

01:20:55.320 --> 01:20:56.610
I need to protect myself.

01:20:56.610 --> 01:20:58.420
I don't wanna feel insecure all the time.

01:20:58.420 --> 01:21:00.243
I wanna feel like we're partners.

01:21:03.797 --> 01:21:04.630
- I don't know.

01:21:04.630 --> 01:21:07.120
I'm just, I, (sighs)

01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:08.343
I need more time.

01:21:11.061 --> 01:21:15.310
(stammering) How am I supposed
to trust you as my wife

01:21:16.210 --> 01:21:18.183
if I know that you're capable of this?

01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:31.810
- All I can do is tell
you how much I love you

01:21:32.950 --> 01:21:35.003
and show my commitment to repair this.

01:21:37.760 --> 01:21:39.713
At a certain point, it's your choice.

01:21:43.274 --> 01:21:45.623
Is it a studio or a one-bedroom?

01:21:47.150 --> 01:21:48.600
Okay.

01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:50.000
And it's right off Columbus?

01:22:01.218 --> 01:22:04.135
(melancholy music)

01:22:05.907 --> 01:22:08.740
(photos rustling)

01:22:24.284 --> 01:22:25.117
- How much longer?

01:22:25.117 --> 01:22:26.040
I'm losing daylight.

01:22:26.040 --> 01:22:26.969
- I need a second.

01:22:26.969 --> 01:22:28.169
- I don't have a second.

01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:32.830
Is that what he's wearing?

01:22:32.830 --> 01:22:35.170
- I have something else I could layer on.

01:22:35.170 --> 01:22:36.310
- Forget it.

01:22:36.310 --> 01:22:37.143
Let's go.

01:22:44.422 --> 01:22:47.005
(camera beeps)

01:22:47.910 --> 01:22:49.003
Um, white side.

01:22:50.330 --> 01:22:51.470
Flip it, please.

01:22:52.771 --> 01:22:54.075
(camera beeps)

01:22:54.075 --> 01:22:59.075
(Collin humming)
(shutter clicking)

01:23:03.850 --> 01:23:04.683
Sorry.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:10.030
- [Kate] You're my first call

01:23:10.030 --> 01:23:11.800
when I have some money for bonds.

01:23:11.800 --> 01:23:13.230
- [Charles] I would hope so.

01:23:13.230 --> 01:23:14.800
So, you're back for another semester?

01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:15.633
- [Kate] Mm-hmm.

01:23:15.633 --> 01:23:17.740
I'm subletting an apartment
up in North Beach.

01:23:18.590 --> 01:23:20.183
- [Charles] How are things with Collin?

01:23:20.183 --> 01:23:22.320
- [Kate] I don't really know.

01:23:22.320 --> 01:23:23.713
We're not together right now.

01:23:23.713 --> 01:23:26.410
I don't know if we can
recover from what happened.

01:23:26.410 --> 01:23:27.243
We tried.

01:23:30.570 --> 01:23:31.900
You seeing anyone?

01:23:31.900 --> 01:23:32.733
- Actually, I am.

01:23:32.733 --> 01:23:34.370
It's a couple of months now.

01:23:34.370 --> 01:23:35.799
We share an affinity for bonds.

01:23:35.799 --> 01:23:38.549
(both chuckling)

01:23:40.090 --> 01:23:42.313
I'm very sorry about what happened.

01:23:44.530 --> 01:23:46.950
- You shouldn't be, it
was completely my fault.

01:23:46.950 --> 01:23:48.450
It had nothing to do with you.

01:23:49.463 --> 01:23:52.240
- Well.
- Well, (chuckling) obviously,

01:23:52.240 --> 01:23:55.870
it did, but what I'm saying
is you shouldn't feel bad.

01:23:55.870 --> 01:23:58.400
I wasn't in the best place emotionally

01:23:58.400 --> 01:24:02.663
and, you know, I'm just
very sorry for everything.

01:24:04.880 --> 01:24:06.220
- If I've learned anything from my work

01:24:06.220 --> 01:24:08.673
it's that the world can
be very unpredictable.

01:24:10.557 --> 01:24:11.390
- Yeah.

01:24:12.674 --> 01:24:17.674
(phone buzzing)
(park visitors chattering)

01:24:20.189 --> 01:24:21.580
Hey, what's up?

01:24:21.580 --> 01:24:23.488
- [Kate's Mom] Kate,
honey, your brother Patrick

01:24:23.488 --> 01:24:26.314
has been in an accident.

01:24:26.314 --> 01:24:28.314
I need you to come home.

01:24:30.463 --> 01:24:33.046
(somber music)

01:26:03.766 --> 01:26:06.933
(soft dramatic music)

01:26:36.712 --> 01:26:39.295
(Kate sobbing)

01:26:40.668 --> 01:26:43.501
(Collin shushing)

01:26:51.332 --> 01:26:53.332
- [Collin] I'm so sorry.

01:26:54.598 --> 01:26:57.015
- [Kate] It happened so fast.

01:27:00.677 --> 01:27:03.344
(Kate sniffles)

01:27:13.657 --> 01:27:15.453
- Do you wanna go inside?

01:27:18.347 --> 01:27:19.847
- It's been a really long day.

01:27:21.320 --> 01:27:22.313
Wanna take a walk?

01:27:23.940 --> 01:27:24.773
- Sure.

01:27:28.399 --> 01:27:31.566
(contemplative music)

01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:42.853
I like your dress.

01:27:43.930 --> 01:27:44.763
- Thanks.

01:27:45.680 --> 01:27:48.900
We wanted it to be a
celebration of his life.

01:27:48.900 --> 01:27:49.733
- Mm.

01:27:50.770 --> 01:27:52.670
I'm sure he would've appreciated that.

01:27:56.850 --> 01:27:58.400
- My parents are a total wreck.

01:28:01.490 --> 01:28:02.640
- I can't even imagine.

01:28:05.552 --> 01:28:07.502
- I don't even know if it's hit me yet.

01:28:12.460 --> 01:28:15.020
- When I heard, when Erin called me

01:28:15.020 --> 01:28:16.320
and told me what happened,

01:28:18.030 --> 01:28:19.780
I had to get on a plane right away.

01:28:21.590 --> 01:28:23.220
I just couldn't bear the thought

01:28:23.220 --> 01:28:25.363
of you going through this alone.

01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:32.500
I know we've been going
back and forth a lot

01:28:32.500 --> 01:28:35.963
about all the wrongs
we've done to each other,

01:28:37.960 --> 01:28:42.690
but we haven't just stopped to think

01:28:42.690 --> 01:28:44.023
about all the right.

01:28:47.307 --> 01:28:50.200
You know, what happened,
it hurt me, yeah, sure.

01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:52.033
But why did it happen?

01:28:54.865 --> 01:28:58.370
(chuckles) You know, it's
because we spent so much time

01:28:58.370 --> 01:29:01.890
talking about work and school,

01:29:01.890 --> 01:29:04.190
traveling back and
forth from city to city,

01:29:04.190 --> 01:29:08.580
that we lost all the closeness that we had

01:29:08.580 --> 01:29:09.993
in the bullshit.

01:29:14.900 --> 01:29:16.750
And then something like this happens.

01:29:20.304 --> 01:29:22.804
(sighs) All the bad shit
just went out of my mind.

01:29:23.960 --> 01:29:28.323
I can't stand the thought
of not being here for you.

01:29:29.500 --> 01:29:33.240
I hate that it took a tragedy
like this for me to see it,

01:29:33.240 --> 01:29:36.169
but I see it.
(contemplative music)

01:29:36.169 --> 01:29:37.586
I see it clearly.

01:29:39.246 --> 01:29:42.163
- (sighs) Come on.

01:29:57.251 --> 01:29:59.834
(Collin sighs)

01:31:19.598 --> 01:31:23.015
