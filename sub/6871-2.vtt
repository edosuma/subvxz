00:01.258 --> 00:02.424
[Man]
Wait. What happened?

00:02.476 --> 00:04.091
I thought you were going
to renovate this place.

00:04.161 --> 00:06.995
As did I, but I was betrayed

00:07.064 --> 00:10.237
by a lying little
country music wannabe.

00:10.357 --> 00:12.057
[Cheryl]
<i>Was that directed at me?</i>

00:12.126 --> 00:13.292
Yes! Who else?

00:13.360 --> 00:15.460
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>who all lies to you!</i>

00:15.529 --> 00:18.497
[Intercom beeps] <i>Also, there's a Mr.
Slater to see you.</i>

00:18.565 --> 00:20.499
Just "Slater."
It's a mononym, like--

00:20.567 --> 00:22.334
Jesus Christ!
Nope.

00:22.403 --> 00:24.403
He's in here, you ritzy ditz!

00:24.471 --> 00:26.238
[Computer shatters]

00:26.307 --> 00:28.240
<i>[Distorted voice]</i>
<i>What are you doing, Dave?</i>

00:28.309 --> 00:30.175
So, uh, should I come back?

00:30.244 --> 00:32.411
No. No, no, no, no, no.
Of course not.

00:32.479 --> 00:34.146
Yeah, that's what
I was thinking.

00:34.214 --> 00:36.415
I mean, whatever the task,
we are up to it.

00:36.483 --> 00:38.450
We are professional and--
[Intercom beeps]

00:38.519 --> 00:40.485
<i>There's a Mr. Slater</i>
<i>to see you.</i>

00:40.554 --> 00:41.740
[Sighs]
I'm gonna go.

00:41.980 --> 00:43.980
Good. Why are you here
in the first place?

00:44.049 --> 00:45.897
Mr. Slater--
Just "Slater"!

00:46.017 --> 00:48.885
And hang on. Excuse me, are you and I
gonna have a problem?

00:48.954 --> 00:51.187
I mean, I'm sure we will
at some point, but--

00:51.256 --> 00:52.355
Sterling! Mr.--

00:52.424 --> 00:53.923
Just "Slater".

00:53.992 --> 00:55.258
Has--
Had--

00:55.327 --> 00:58.194
an important assignment
for us, which I'm sure

00:58.263 --> 01:01.798
we can kick right through
the basket for a homerun.

01:01.867 --> 01:03.066
I'm gonna go.

01:03.135 --> 01:05.802
Look, you're already here.

01:05.871 --> 01:08.938
Why not just tell us
what the mission is?

01:09.007 --> 01:12.208
I will, but only
because I choose to.

01:12.277 --> 01:15.211
One of our-- well, I guess you
could call him a freelancer--

01:15.280 --> 01:17.147
What do you call him?
I call him a freelancer.

01:17.215 --> 01:18.281
So shut up, please.

01:18.350 --> 01:20.150
Anyway, he needs
an extraction from

01:20.218 --> 01:21.918
[Latin American accent]
Buenos Aires.

01:21.987 --> 01:23.853
Ugh, it's just us.
You can say,

01:23.922 --> 01:25.088
[American accent]
"Bwaynos Air-eez."

01:25.157 --> 01:27.157
And-- hush.
And what operation

01:27.225 --> 01:29.259
is the CIA conducting
in Argentina?

01:29.327 --> 01:32.095
Oh, sorry.
It's called "Operation Nunya."

01:32.164 --> 01:34.097
I--
As in "beeswax," Lana.

01:34.166 --> 01:37.834
Yes, I--
[Muffled] Dr. Kane, report to the burn unit.

01:37.903 --> 01:40.904
To help a patient
who's been burned?

01:40.972 --> 01:42.071
No.

01:42.140 --> 01:44.140
Anyway-- [Sighs]
his cover's been blown.

01:44.209 --> 01:46.009
Argentine intelligence
is onto him,

01:46.077 --> 01:48.878
and he needs an extraction
A.S.A.G.D.M.F.P.

01:48.947 --> 01:51.948
So, why us? Why not
keep it in-house at CIA?

01:52.017 --> 01:56.152
Because, turns out,
you actually know this operator.

01:56.221 --> 01:58.121
Uh, do you mind?
Hmm?

01:58.190 --> 01:59.189
[Gasps]
Oh.

01:59.257 --> 02:02.192
[All] Conway Stern?

02:02.260 --> 02:04.797
Yes, Conway Stern.

You guys mind if I start?
I'll start.

02:49.200 --> 02:51.071
Are you out
of your shitting mind?

02:51.191 --> 02:51.951
Sterling!
Excuse me?

02:52.014 --> 02:53.800
He literally
stabbed me in the back!

02:53.920 --> 02:55.920
Because you jeopardized
his mission.

02:55.989 --> 03:00.091
What mission? To sell classified military
technology to the Chinese?

03:00.160 --> 03:03.161
Phony technology
we <i> wanted </i> China to have.

03:03.230 --> 03:05.997
They've been chasing their tails
on the whisper drive for years.

03:06.066 --> 03:07.832
Oh.
"Oh"?

03:07.901 --> 03:09.834
I knew it.
In my heart of hearts,

03:09.903 --> 03:11.836
I knew he was
one of the good guys.

03:11.905 --> 03:14.072
Literally! The back!
Stabbed it!

03:14.141 --> 03:17.008
Well, then you people
ripped off his hands, so...

03:17.077 --> 03:20.812
After he literally stabbed me!
In the back!

03:20.881 --> 03:22.213
Oh, give it a rest, Sterling.

03:22.282 --> 03:24.082
I'm sure you did something to deserve it.
What--?

03:24.151 --> 03:26.251
But now you have a chance
to right that wrong,

03:26.319 --> 03:27.986
which is a rare thing.

03:28.054 --> 03:29.854
About as rare as getting
called up to the majors

03:29.923 --> 03:30.855
from single-a ball--

03:30.924 --> 03:32.223
Hey!
Lana.

03:32.292 --> 03:35.026
I assume that was a sports
analogy meant to be cutting,

03:35.095 --> 03:38.096
but we will take the mission,
won't we, Sterling?

03:38.165 --> 03:39.998
Huh? Yeah.
Oh, sorry.

03:40.066 --> 03:42.834
It's just I'm worried,
my entire life,

03:42.903 --> 03:45.036
I've been misusing
the word "literally"!

03:45.105 --> 03:48.039
[Intercom beeps]
<i>And certainly overusing.</i>

03:48.108 --> 03:49.040
[Electricity crackles]

03:49.109 --> 03:50.942
[Tango music playing]

03:51.011 --> 03:52.827
[Archer] You're not worried?
[Lana] Why should I worry?

03:52.913 --> 03:55.780
Because I'm the one
that ripped of Conway's hand?

03:55.849 --> 03:58.016
No. About--
Or that he'll double-cross us again?

03:58.084 --> 04:00.051
Which, a blowjob says he does.

04:00.120 --> 04:03.755
And mother and Slater and the CIA
are idiots for trusting him,

04:03.824 --> 04:06.825
but I'm talking about us flying on the
same plane, Lana. What if it crashed?

04:06.893 --> 04:09.928
Then I wouldn't have had
to watch you pound 20 drinks

04:09.996 --> 04:12.163
and then try to talk
the stewardess into a handjob.

04:12.232 --> 04:14.132
Where are you getting 20 drinks?

04:14.201 --> 04:16.034
Uh, from ten doubles.

04:16.101 --> 04:18.002
"A", those were mini-bottles,

04:18.071 --> 04:20.137
and two,
I'm talking about A.J., Lana.

04:20.207 --> 04:21.773
Who's going to take care of her

04:21.841 --> 04:23.942
if something happens
to both of us?

04:25.278 --> 04:27.879
Well, me. Obviously.

04:27.948 --> 04:29.228
You think-- [Chuckles]
Okay. Wow.

04:29.282 --> 04:31.282
You think,
in the event of their deaths,

04:31.351 --> 04:34.185
that you would be
A.J.'s legal guardian?

04:34.254 --> 04:35.887
Who else would they
possibly choose?

04:35.956 --> 04:37.989
You've met yourself, right?

04:38.058 --> 04:39.924
If it's anybody around here,
it's me.

04:39.993 --> 04:41.960
Of course.

04:55.141 --> 04:57.775
All right, Virginia Slim.
You're--

04:57.844 --> 04:58.910
Nap time!

04:58.979 --> 05:01.112
I have a meeting.
Good-bye.

05:01.181 --> 05:02.747
[Tango music playing]

05:02.816 --> 05:05.016
Look, don't worry
about A.J., okay?

05:05.085 --> 05:06.951
[Scoffs] Well, I think
one of us should.

05:07.020 --> 05:09.220
No, I--
And I vote for mother and Woodhouse.

05:09.289 --> 05:10.989
To raise my child?

05:11.057 --> 05:13.858
<i>Our </i> child, Lana.
And yes. And--

05:13.927 --> 05:15.087
Can we talk about this later?

05:16.963 --> 05:18.830
Oh, we're definitely
gonna talk about it later,

05:18.899 --> 05:19.964
I can promise you that.

05:20.033 --> 05:21.154
And-- [Sighs]
Can you promise

05:21.201 --> 05:22.800
that even though Conway--

05:22.869 --> 05:24.903
Literally--
--stabbed you in the back,

05:24.971 --> 05:27.071
that you won't do anything
revenge-y and stupid

05:27.140 --> 05:29.040
when he opens the door?

05:29.109 --> 05:32.911
Hmm. I want to say...

05:32.979 --> 05:36.247
No! Revenge rampage!

You're out...of sugar.

06:44.150 --> 06:46.884
[Groans] [Raspy voice] Oh, good.
You're making tea.

06:46.953 --> 06:49.053
'Cause I could use some
with honey and lemon.

06:49.122 --> 06:51.155
[Coughs]
And bourbon.

06:51.224 --> 06:54.125
But actually,
without the honey and lemon

06:54.194 --> 06:55.259
and the tea.

06:55.328 --> 06:56.961
So just bourbon.

06:57.030 --> 06:58.997
Yeah, I doubt if--
[Coughs] [Groans]

06:59.065 --> 07:01.833
[Normal voice] Oh, shut up. Don't ruin it.
I had something for--

07:01.901 --> 07:03.801
Puke Skywalker? Mm.

07:03.870 --> 07:05.069
God damn it!

07:05.138 --> 07:07.805
Anyway, I doubt the robot
has any bourbon,

07:07.874 --> 07:12.143
and I'm not really in the mood
for a WD-40 and coke.

07:12.212 --> 07:14.348
Unless that is, literally,
the only thing to drink.

07:17.100 --> 07:18.849
I think I might be concussed.

07:18.918 --> 07:20.837
Hell hath no fury, huh?
Meaning?

07:20.957 --> 07:23.087
As a woman scorned.
Lana, remember?

07:23.156 --> 07:25.156
I kinda scorned you
last time we met?

07:25.224 --> 07:28.025
[Chuckling] Yeah, you are
definitely concussed.

07:28.094 --> 07:29.894
Not to mention a decepticon!

07:29.962 --> 07:31.862
Where the hell
did you get a bionic hand?

07:31.931 --> 07:32.897
Uh...

07:32.965 --> 07:34.832
[Whirring]
So...

07:34.901 --> 07:37.324
what's new?
How you been?

07:37.586 --> 07:39.382
Sharper image?
Uh-huh.

07:39.502 --> 07:40.867
Sounds more like Krieger.

07:40.879 --> 07:42.546
Jesus Christ!
Will he not rest

07:42.614 --> 07:44.581
until we've all been
enslaved by Skynet?

07:44.650 --> 07:46.683
Hey, we are leaving
in five, so--

07:46.752 --> 07:49.553
Right after I enjoy this
<i>mate </i> and <i> caña </i> smoothie

07:49.621 --> 07:52.556
with a WD-40 float.

07:52.624 --> 07:53.824
[Coughs]

07:53.892 --> 07:56.526
Although "enjoy" is maybe
a bit strong.

07:56.595 --> 07:58.628
Ugh. Conway,
grab whatever you need,

07:58.697 --> 08:00.497
presumably
some fresh nine-volts,

08:00.566 --> 08:01.832
and let's get
this extraction going.

08:01.900 --> 08:03.733
I can't.
I don't have the intel yet.

08:03.802 --> 08:05.802
What intel?
Slater said, "extraction."

08:05.871 --> 08:08.538
When he asked us
to come rescue you.

08:08.607 --> 08:10.507
From what?
Your mom's antique vagina?

08:10.576 --> 08:11.608
You son of a--
[Growls]

08:12.711 --> 08:14.478
Hey! Enough, you two!

08:14.546 --> 08:16.480
[Both] Tell him that!
Pretty sure I just did.

08:16.548 --> 08:18.882
Now, what and where
is this "intel"?

08:18.951 --> 08:21.551
It's a computer file
with the real identity

08:21.620 --> 08:23.487
of every single CIA agent

08:23.555 --> 08:25.455
operating in central
and South America.

08:25.524 --> 08:26.845
Argentina's using it
for leverage,

08:26.892 --> 08:28.692
threatening to trade it
to the Soviets.

08:28.760 --> 08:30.827
Wait.
Isn't Argentina our ally?

08:30.896 --> 08:33.462
You'd think, right? After we
threw them that lovely coup?

08:33.532 --> 08:35.765
So, the file is on
the mainframe computer

08:35.833 --> 08:37.734
of the Argentine
secret intelligence service.

08:37.803 --> 08:40.736
Okay. Here's what we do--
How about maybe let him finish?

08:40.806 --> 08:43.607
Hmm. Okay. But then
we go with my plan.

08:43.674 --> 08:46.510
The mainframe is a standalone
in a secure vault.

08:46.578 --> 08:48.745
Hardened, keycard,
and retinal scan entry.

08:48.814 --> 08:51.448
On the top floor of the
intelligence building itself,

08:51.517 --> 08:52.782
which is heavily guarded
at all times,

08:52.851 --> 08:55.418
by Argentine special ops
on standing orders

08:55.487 --> 08:59.723
to shoot to kill any and all
unauthorized personnel.

08:59.791 --> 09:01.658
You mentioned something
about a plan?

09:01.727 --> 09:05.829
[Sighs] I mean, he obviously
thinks he has a plan, so whatever.

09:05.898 --> 09:07.497
Let's hear it.

09:12.704 --> 09:14.571
Where is it?
Where's what?

09:14.640 --> 09:16.840
What are you--
I flushed it!

09:16.909 --> 09:19.876
[Gasps] I will kill you!
[Choking]

09:19.945 --> 09:21.578
Where you stand!

09:21.647 --> 09:22.913
[Choked scream]
[Woman] Hey!

09:22.981 --> 09:25.815
Is it too much to ask,
during the goddamn work day,

09:25.884 --> 09:29.486
for two separate sessions
of 80 uninterrupted minutes each

09:29.555 --> 09:30.887
of quality dump time?

09:30.956 --> 09:33.490
[Gasping] I mean, I'm
not a labor attorney.

09:33.559 --> 09:35.492
Yes, it is entirely
too much to ask!

09:35.561 --> 09:36.826
I thought so, yeah.

09:36.895 --> 09:39.629
So I'll pass that on
to who or whomever asked.

09:39.698 --> 09:41.765
And if you harmed
one single hair

09:41.833 --> 09:43.767
on her little brown head,
I will--

09:43.835 --> 09:44.835
Whose head?
Wait, do what?

09:44.870 --> 09:46.469
Baby A.J.!

09:46.538 --> 09:47.604
She's missing!
[Both gasp]

09:47.673 --> 09:48.872
Oh, my God!
Oh, thank God!

09:48.941 --> 09:50.574
And since you are

09:50.642 --> 09:52.542
the only one around here
who hates babies--

09:52.611 --> 09:54.644
[choking]
Just baby people.

09:54.713 --> 09:55.912
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Come on! [Gasping]

09:55.981 --> 09:58.648
I'm sure-- wait.
Did you murder the baby?

09:58.717 --> 10:01.851
Uh-uh.
No, but like "swearsie-realsies"?

10:01.920 --> 10:03.720
[Strained voice]
Swearsie-realsies.

10:03.789 --> 10:06.690
And that's pretty sacred
to us, so...

10:06.758 --> 10:08.558
[Gasping, coughing]

10:08.627 --> 10:10.560
we'll go help you
look for baby A.J.

10:10.629 --> 10:13.930
[High-pitched fart] In, like,
five-teen, 40 minutes.

10:13.999 --> 10:16.566
And so Conway's plan

10:16.635 --> 10:18.902
doesn't strike you
as unnecessarily complicated?

10:18.971 --> 10:20.737
[Archer]
No, Lana, it doesn't.

10:20.806 --> 10:22.505
And it doesn't strike you

10:22.574 --> 10:24.941
as "Brazilian minstrel show
meets <i> Trading Places"?</i>

10:25.010 --> 10:26.743
No, Lana, it doesn't.

10:26.812 --> 10:28.645
And that's not just because

10:28.714 --> 10:30.747
you get to wear that
ri-dork-ulous facerug.

10:30.816 --> 10:31.915
No, Lana, it-- look.

10:31.984 --> 10:33.617
If I have to pull this car over,

10:33.685 --> 10:34.918
we're all gonna
be murdered, so...

10:34.987 --> 10:36.920
Just get us
in the damn garage, man.

10:36.989 --> 10:38.622
[Slams on brakes]

10:38.690 --> 10:39.923
Hey! You're not
the boss of me!

10:39.992 --> 10:41.891
Archer, just--
Or you!

10:41.960 --> 10:44.694
I don't care if you are the
president and first lady of Brazil

10:44.763 --> 10:46.529
on a pan-American
goodwill tour

10:46.598 --> 10:48.031
of intelligence
headquarters-es.

10:48.100 --> 10:51.968
Coronel Lando Calrissiano,
<i>de Las Fuerzas Especiales,</i>

10:52.037 --> 10:54.771
doesn't work for you!

10:54.840 --> 10:56.640
Although he has nailed
his backstory.

10:56.708 --> 10:57.707
Lando Cal--?

10:57.776 --> 10:59.576
<i>Por qué no te callas?</i>

10:59.645 --> 11:01.811
Will you shut up?
I need to think!

11:01.880 --> 11:03.813
Don't yell at me,
I didn't lose her.

11:03.882 --> 11:05.815
Now just try
to retrace your steps.

11:05.884 --> 11:07.684
[Fabric tearing]

11:07.753 --> 11:09.753
Well, I wasn't
in the sofa cushions.

11:09.821 --> 11:12.489
Agh! Well,
you could have said that!

11:12.557 --> 11:16.593
I did.
I thought you were being sarcastic!

11:16.662 --> 11:19.496
It is kinda hard
to tell with you.

11:19.564 --> 11:20.864
[Archer] Okay, here we go.

11:20.932 --> 11:23.833
Conway, shut up and try
to look semi-presidential.

11:23.902 --> 11:26.970
And Lana, try to look--
actually, yeah. Matronly.

11:27.039 --> 11:28.505
You nailed it.
[Laughs]

11:28.573 --> 11:29.773
You know...

11:29.841 --> 11:30.940
So anyways--

11:31.009 --> 11:32.676
Ay! Coronel!

11:32.744 --> 11:33.943
Um, okay.

11:34.012 --> 11:36.546
<i>Su carat, Coronel, por favor.</i>

11:36.615 --> 11:40.550
Uh, <i> bueno. Conmigo estan</i>

11:40.619 --> 11:41.651

11:45.991 --> 11:47.557
<i>Espere.</i>

11:47.626 --> 11:50.627
<i>Lando? Calrissiano?!</i>

11:50.696 --> 11:52.662
Okay, so here's the thing
with that.

11:52.731 --> 11:54.631
[Groans]

11:54.700 --> 11:56.533
[Cocks weapon]
Boring conversation anyway.

11:56.601 --> 11:57.734
God damn it, Archer!

11:57.803 --> 12:00.670
That's Coronel Calrissiano
to you!

12:00.739 --> 12:01.705
[Tires screeching]

12:01.773 --> 12:03.506
[Conway] Archer!

12:03.575 --> 12:05.875
[Lana] Don't drive angry!

12:05.944 --> 12:07.711
What the hell are you doing?

12:07.779 --> 12:10.547
I'm archer-izing this plan!

12:10.615 --> 12:11.948
What? No, no! Uh-uh.

12:12.017 --> 12:13.717
You cannot make yourself a verb!

12:13.785 --> 12:15.452
I will not allow it.

12:15.520 --> 12:18.688
I'm a verb now, Lana.
Deal with it!

12:18.757 --> 12:20.790
And then, also,
cover me, please.

12:20.859 --> 12:22.492
[Soldiers cocking weapons]

12:37.642 --> 12:38.975
[Clears throat] Uh, <i> perdón?</i>

12:39.044 --> 12:41.911
On the ground, Pyle!
What are you--

12:41.980 --> 12:45.682
Oh. Uh, see how
I switched to English?

12:45.751 --> 12:47.951
Uh, I was testing him.
Good work, Pyle.

12:48.019 --> 12:49.786
[Groans]

12:49.855 --> 12:51.755
<i>Su carta, Coronel, por favor.</i>

12:51.823 --> 12:54.557
How about a big hand
for Pyle, gang?

12:54.626 --> 12:55.658
[Cocks weapons]
[Tango music playing]

12:55.727 --> 12:56.659

13:01.767 --> 13:03.600
<i>Su carta, Coronel!</i>
<i>Por favor.</i>

13:03.668 --> 13:05.802
Jesus Christ, Pyle!
I heard you.

[Blows landing]

13:07.639 --> 13:09.472
Archer!

13:09.541 --> 13:11.441
[Yells]

13:13.912 --> 13:15.812
What are you doing?
Shooting out the glass.

13:15.881 --> 13:17.580
No, no, no! Don't! It's--

13:17.649 --> 13:18.615
[bullets ricochet]

13:18.683 --> 13:19.716
Bulletproof.

13:21.953 --> 13:22.886
[Archer screams]

13:22.954 --> 13:24.788
[Muffled] Archer!

13:26.892 --> 13:28.958
So, uh, how come
you and I didn't hook up

13:29.027 --> 13:30.860
last time we worked together?

13:30.929 --> 13:33.696
Well, "A", you were
too busy banging Cheryl

13:33.765 --> 13:35.498
or Carol or Cristal--

13:35.567 --> 13:37.500
Oh, right.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:37.569 --> 13:38.701
The crazy Jew-Santa chick.

13:38.770 --> 13:40.537
And "B" through "Z",

13:40.605 --> 13:42.605
because you're
a large-diameter dickhole.

13:42.674 --> 13:44.541
Mm-hmm. Well,
you're looking good, girl.

13:44.609 --> 13:45.875
Lot curvier than I remember.

13:45.944 --> 13:47.911
I had a baby.

13:47.979 --> 13:51.548
Oh. Sorry. Never mind.

13:51.616 --> 13:52.949
Never mind what?

13:53.018 --> 13:54.884
Like, name it.

13:54.953 --> 13:56.619
You know...

13:56.688 --> 13:58.521
[Breathing heavily]

13:58.590 --> 14:00.757
[Out of breath] Oh.

14:00.826 --> 14:04.427
So, you done archer-izing?

14:06.598 --> 14:07.697
[Music ends]

14:09.413 --> 14:11.182
Because, you jackass,

14:11.302 --> 14:14.985
to recap, you locked us
in the stupid limo!

14:15.105 --> 14:17.806
Well, I still don't see
why that means I'm the one

14:17.875 --> 14:19.007
who has to carry Pyle.

14:19.076 --> 14:21.076
Well, then slice out
his retinas, okay?

14:21.145 --> 14:23.778
I can't.
It would kill Lou-Ann.

14:23.847 --> 14:25.269
[Elevator bell dings]

14:25.389 --> 14:27.248
Oh, and speaking of--

14:27.368 --> 14:28.917
God damn it!

14:28.986 --> 14:29.951
[Groans]

14:30.020 --> 14:31.753
Ay!

14:31.822 --> 14:33.688
Speaking of what?

14:33.757 --> 14:35.023
If something happens
to both of us,

14:35.092 --> 14:36.791
who's gonna take care
of the baby?

14:36.860 --> 14:39.728
[Sniggers] Her baby's yours?

14:39.796 --> 14:41.997
Can we please put a pin in this?

14:42.065 --> 14:43.932
No, Lana, we can't!

14:44.001 --> 14:46.735
I want to know why you don't
want it to be mother.

14:48.772 --> 14:51.072
Because,
how did you lose a baby?

14:51.141 --> 14:53.008
She was right there in the pram.

14:53.076 --> 14:55.877
I made a drink,
my furrier called.

14:55.946 --> 14:58.013
Spoiler alert,
he's robbing me blind.

14:58.081 --> 15:00.882
I called immigration, tried
to get his father deported.

15:00.951 --> 15:02.817
I made another drink,
but I was out of ice,

15:02.886 --> 15:03.952
so I-- [Gasps]

15:04.021 --> 15:05.687
[All] What?
[Cyril] What is it?

15:05.756 --> 15:07.822
Krieger! He was
skulking around out there

15:07.891 --> 15:09.724
while I went out to get ice.

15:09.793 --> 15:12.093
Come on,
to that Nazi freak's lab!

15:12.162 --> 15:14.963
Hey, whoa!
Are guns really necessary?

15:16.733 --> 15:18.633
'Cause I'm seriously asking.

15:18.702 --> 15:20.902
[Lana] Seriously?
[Archer] Yes, Lana, seriously.

15:20.971 --> 15:23.838
Why isn't my mother
good enough to raise A.J.?

15:23.907 --> 15:26.675
No! Don't shoot!
There's a baby!

15:26.743 --> 15:28.910
And why?
Why do you have the baby?

15:28.979 --> 15:31.012
Oh, my God!

15:31.081 --> 15:33.081
Okay. So,
here's the thing with that.

15:33.150 --> 15:34.751
[All gasp]
[Cyril] That is...a nightmare.

15:34.818 --> 15:36.751
[Cheryl] Seriously?
[Gillette] Goddamn, dude.

15:36.820 --> 15:38.853
You were going
to make her a robot?

15:38.922 --> 15:41.022
I wish.
I mean, no! No.

15:41.091 --> 15:42.857
I was doing market research

15:42.926 --> 15:46.828
for the TB-800
A.K.A. Cyberneddly Teddly.

15:46.897 --> 15:49.664
Oh, please!
That's a baby skeleton.

15:49.733 --> 15:51.766
No, but--
once I figure out

15:51.835 --> 15:53.835
how to grow actual bear tissue
to cover it--

15:53.904 --> 15:54.869
Goddamn, dude!
Dude!

15:54.938 --> 15:56.605
Damn! How creepy!
Damn!

15:56.673 --> 15:58.707
No, wait!
Teddly's here...somewhere.

15:58.775 --> 16:00.742
Or was. I swear! He--
[Baby crying]

16:00.811 --> 16:01.977
Teddly? Teddly?!

16:02.045 --> 16:04.079
Cyril, secure the child.

16:04.147 --> 16:07.015
And the rest of you,
I can't see any benefit

16:07.084 --> 16:09.884
in telling Lana
what happened here today.

16:09.953 --> 16:11.019
Understood?
Yeah.

16:11.088 --> 16:12.687
Aw!
I'm not saying nothing.

16:12.756 --> 16:14.022
I'm on board for that.
And Krieger...

16:14.091 --> 16:17.859
I swear to God, if I catch you
near this child again,

16:17.928 --> 16:19.661
But--
and the implied threat here

16:19.730 --> 16:21.696
is that I will shoot you
in the genitals,

16:21.765 --> 16:23.999
and then sit here
sipping amontillado sherry

16:24.067 --> 16:26.001
while you bleed to death.

16:27.104 --> 16:28.036
[Timidly]
Mee-beep.

16:30.874 --> 16:32.641
[Sighs]

16:38.048 --> 16:40.782
Ta-da!

16:40.851 --> 16:42.050
Oh.

16:42.119 --> 16:44.019
[Chuckles]

16:44.087 --> 16:46.921
Yeah, thanks,
Mr. Bear-jangles.

16:48.825 --> 16:50.058
[Humming]

16:50.127 --> 16:52.627
[Scatting]

16:52.696 --> 16:54.663
Wait, you already knew the code?

16:54.731 --> 16:56.765
Of course he did.
He's a cyborg.

16:56.833 --> 16:58.733
It was probably
Gaius Baltar's--

16:58.802 --> 17:00.835
[groans repeatedly]

17:00.904 --> 17:01.936
Archer?

17:02.005 --> 17:04.673
You double-crossing
son of a bitch!

17:04.741 --> 17:05.940
[Out of breath] Called it.

17:06.009 --> 17:08.609
Well, yeah. Come on.
We all saw this coming.

17:08.679 --> 17:10.744
Now, drop them.

17:10.814 --> 17:13.114
I was gonna say
"zip code," guys--

17:13.183 --> 17:15.817
Okay, idiots, thanks for
helping me get the disk.

17:15.886 --> 17:18.686
The Soviets are going to pay out
the <i> zadnitsa</i> for this thing.

17:18.755 --> 17:20.722
But you could have gotten
the disk yourself.

17:20.790 --> 17:22.022
Why drag us into it?

17:22.092 --> 17:24.125
Well, I knew dick van head
over there

17:24.194 --> 17:26.694
could pass for a Latino
to get us in.

17:26.762 --> 17:28.763
[Archer, weakly] Nailed it.
But mostly for revenge.

17:28.799 --> 17:32.067
Remember how you ripped off
my hand, woman?!

17:32.135 --> 17:34.736
Yeah, vaguely,
but if it's revenge you want,

17:34.805 --> 17:35.937
why don't you shoot me?

17:36.006 --> 17:38.039
I was going to, but come on.

17:38.108 --> 17:40.108
I'm not a monster.
You just had a kid.

17:40.177 --> 17:41.810
[Archer, weakly] Me too, though.

17:41.878 --> 17:43.111
And what are you doing
in the window?

17:43.180 --> 17:45.980
[A la Chuck D.] Base!
Jumping. [Laughs]

17:46.049 --> 17:47.115
This is a parachute.

17:47.184 --> 17:49.207
[Sighs] Well, Conway...

17:49.327 --> 17:50.467
you win this round.

17:50.587 --> 17:53.214
Who are you?
Wait. Hang on.

17:53.334 --> 17:55.657
Horatio Kane.
God damn it.

17:55.726 --> 17:57.792
But "Kane"
obviously spelled--

17:57.861 --> 17:58.793
I got it.

17:58.862 --> 18:00.662
Oh, and hey, give me a call

18:00.731 --> 18:02.030
if things don't work out
with the kid.

18:02.099 --> 18:03.765
Wh--
And you lose the baby weight.

18:03.834 --> 18:04.899
[Gasps]

18:04.968 --> 18:06.735
[Growls]

18:06.803 --> 18:09.871
[Groans]
Are...you...kidding me?

18:09.940 --> 18:11.973
[Screams]

18:12.042 --> 18:15.043
[Laughs] Yeah! Lose that
weight, Conway Stern!

18:15.112 --> 18:17.045
Or whatever your real name is!
[Parachute opens]

18:17.114 --> 18:18.880
[Conway] I lied!

18:18.949 --> 18:22.917
That is my real name!

18:22.986 --> 18:26.087
[Southern accent] Maw, they
got ol' Lando this time.

18:26.156 --> 18:29.057
[Coughs] I'm done for.

18:29.126 --> 18:31.659
Archer, shut up.
You're gonna be okay.

18:31.728 --> 18:33.027
You really think so?
[Vehicle approaching]

18:33.096 --> 18:35.630
I mean, maybe.

18:35.699 --> 18:36.831
[Tires screeching]

18:36.900 --> 18:37.966
Although that can't bode well.

18:38.034 --> 18:39.801
You get the disk?

18:39.870 --> 18:41.970
Slater?
Did you get the disk?

18:42.038 --> 18:44.072
Yes, idiot.
[Coughs]

18:44.141 --> 18:46.074
And, also,
several bullets, so--

18:46.143 --> 18:47.842
Then come on, get in the back.

18:47.911 --> 18:49.677
I got a plane waiting
at an airstrip.

18:54.151 --> 18:55.950
So, hey,
about this blowjob--

18:56.019 --> 18:58.052
Shut up!
Conway was a traitor.

18:58.121 --> 19:00.622
He was gonna sell the disk
to the Soviets.

19:00.690 --> 19:01.890
Yeah, yeah.
We kinda suspected that.

19:01.958 --> 19:04.609
"Kinda"?
So you sent us into a--

19:04.694 --> 19:06.928
Wait. So you followed us
down here?

19:06.997 --> 19:09.831
Come on. We're not gonna put
a couple of untested rookies

19:09.900 --> 19:10.965
in the starting line-up
of game seven...

19:11.034 --> 19:12.700
[Muffled]
...of the world--

19:12.769 --> 19:14.736
Seriously,
okay, as I was saying--

19:14.805 --> 19:17.038
God damn it, Archer!
I am not giving you a blowjob!

19:17.107 --> 19:20.842
Not that. A.J.
If something happens to us.

19:20.911 --> 19:23.812
I really don't think that this
is the time to talk about that.

19:23.880 --> 19:25.680
When then?
[Coughs]

19:25.749 --> 19:27.682
Why don't you want
to talk about it, Lana?

19:27.751 --> 19:28.917
[Sighs]

19:28.985 --> 19:31.886
Because I'm afraid
it'll hurt your feelings.

19:31.955 --> 19:33.896
Because, if anything
happens to me, and--

19:34.016 --> 19:35.991
just me, Archer--

19:36.111 --> 19:38.793
then A.J. would live
with my parents.

19:38.862 --> 19:40.061
Oh.

19:40.130 --> 19:42.897
Yeah. Uh, I-I-I guess
that makes sense.

19:42.966 --> 19:44.768
[Coughs]

19:44.888 --> 19:47.425
They're probably
pretty old, though, right?

19:47.545 --> 19:50.144
And if anything
happened to them,

19:50.264 --> 19:52.674
then A.J. would live
with my sister.

19:53.769 --> 19:55.553
You have a sister?
[Groans]

19:55.673 --> 19:58.646
Yes, Archer, I have a sister.

20:00.163 --> 20:02.884
She younger?

20:04.054 --> 20:05.720
[Screams]

20:06.376 --> 20:16.693
