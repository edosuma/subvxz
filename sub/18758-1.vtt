01:31.304 --> 01:32.532
Over here!

01:40.814 --> 01:42.748
Hurry up, Billy!

02:18.652 --> 02:21.644
Don't you love New Orleans?

02:34.100 --> 02:38.093
Come on over here
and dance with me.

03:08.768 --> 03:10.770
Look what she ordered.

03:10.770 --> 03:12.806
Come here, honey.

03:12.806 --> 03:16.776
Darling, 11 months is
a little young for jambalaya.

03:16.776 --> 03:19.412
The doctor said we should
start her on solids.

03:19.412 --> 03:20.814
Jambalaya's not solids.

03:20.814 --> 03:23.216
He meant mushed-up
carrots and beets.

03:23.216 --> 03:24.484
That's for average kids.

03:24.484 --> 03:26.720
Look, sweetheart. See?

03:26.720 --> 03:28.355
That's delicious.

03:28.355 --> 03:30.690
It's not spicy at all.

03:30.690 --> 03:32.092
Jeff...

03:32.092 --> 03:35.195
Come on. I rest my case.

03:35.195 --> 03:36.930
Isn't she great?

03:36.930 --> 03:39.899
She's great. You're great.

03:43.270 --> 03:45.272
They said
their name was Truman?

03:45.272 --> 03:47.274
-Newman.
-Ah, Newman.

03:47.274 --> 03:49.776
You better get out of there.

03:49.776 --> 03:52.379
Hey, Newman.

03:52.379 --> 03:54.147
Isn't New Orleans great?

03:54.147 --> 03:56.016
Great.
Would you like a beer?

03:56.016 --> 03:57.651
-Sure.
-Two, please.

03:57.651 --> 04:00.086
-Do you folks travel much?
-A lot. Yeah.

04:00.086 --> 04:03.189
We've cut down
ever since the baby.

04:03.189 --> 04:05.292
What line are you in?

04:05.292 --> 04:09.396
Brain surgery.
Professional brain surgery.

04:09.396 --> 04:11.364
That's a hell of a field.
Challenging.

04:11.364 --> 04:14.634
Actually, I'm thinking
about giving it up.

04:14.634 --> 04:16.702
The racket's getting to me.

04:16.702 --> 04:19.372
I was working with patients
who'd undergone severe trauma...

04:19.372 --> 04:22.976
to the patella,
here in the front of the brain.

04:22.976 --> 04:26.780
You get whacked there,
you start going in circles...

04:26.780 --> 04:28.682
lose all sense of direction.

04:28.682 --> 04:30.517
I read about that
in ''People'' magazine.

04:30.517 --> 04:34.487
You did? The pressure
started getting to me.

04:34.487 --> 04:37.924
My hands started shaking.
Dropping scalpels everywhere.

04:37.924 --> 04:40.560
Somebody's pulling our leg.

04:40.560 --> 04:43.663
-Almost had you.
-Not me.

04:43.663 --> 04:47.334
-What do you really do?
-We're in espionage.

04:47.334 --> 04:52.906
-Were. We're retired.
-And that's the truth.

04:52.906 --> 04:56.109
I love crashing parties.

04:56.109 --> 04:57.911
You didn't know those people?

04:57.911 --> 05:00.847
-They didn't know us, either.
-You guys are too much.

05:00.847 --> 05:05.443
-You ain't seen nothing yet.
-Oh, yeah, Mr. Spy?

05:06.853 --> 05:09.723
You're not planning on
smoking that in the room?

05:09.723 --> 05:11.658
I certainly am...

05:11.658 --> 05:14.027
not planning on smoking
this in the room.

05:14.027 --> 05:17.631
-I'll Jane for a walk.
-Louise.

05:17.631 --> 05:19.466
Get some formula
while you're out?

05:19.466 --> 05:21.368
Sure. Night, folks.

05:21.368 --> 05:23.103
Bye-bye.
I'm with you.

05:23.103 --> 05:25.405
I'd never let Vern smoke
a cigar in the room.

05:25.405 --> 05:26.906
Jane Louise!

05:26.906 --> 05:29.909
Is her name Jane Louise
or Louise Jane?

05:29.909 --> 05:31.411
We can't agree.

05:31.411 --> 05:36.916
I think it's strange to name
a girl after her mother.

05:36.916 --> 05:40.320
Men do it all the time,
name the boys after themselves.

05:40.320 --> 05:41.821
Why not the women?

05:41.821 --> 05:45.492
Sweetheart,
why don't we let them decide?

05:45.492 --> 05:47.994
By the time I finish this...

05:47.994 --> 05:50.519
it'll be ready
for my child's child.

05:58.171 --> 06:00.874
What are you doing?

06:00.874 --> 06:03.570
Help! Don't hurt me!

06:04.678 --> 06:08.079
Don't forget the watch.
Shut up, fat boy.

06:11.317 --> 06:15.955
My name is Muerte!
Don't you forget that.

06:15.955 --> 06:17.388
Can we go?

06:25.098 --> 06:27.567
Come on, man!

06:27.567 --> 06:30.203
-l want to go home.
-No, no, no.

06:30.203 --> 06:32.739
That's three.
Let's call it a night.

06:32.739 --> 06:34.974
-Not yet!
-There's going to be cops.

06:34.974 --> 06:39.312
No! I want one more.

06:39.312 --> 06:41.481
Damn.

06:41.481 --> 06:43.540
And here he comes.

06:47.120 --> 06:50.223
Relax, guys,
the baby won't hurt you.

06:50.223 --> 06:53.193
Give me the wallet
and the watch.

06:53.193 --> 06:55.995
Look, this is a real baby.

06:55.995 --> 06:57.497
I don't want any trouble.

06:57.497 --> 06:58.987
Then hand it over.

07:06.272 --> 07:07.907
Let's go. The watch.

07:07.907 --> 07:09.602
It's a Swatch.

07:13.847 --> 07:16.509
Are we finished? Can I go?

07:19.786 --> 07:21.621
We had a deal.

07:21.621 --> 07:23.816
You commit a felony.
I go.

07:30.063 --> 07:34.734
My name is Muerte.

07:34.734 --> 07:38.304
Pleased to meet you, Morty.
My name is Jeff.

07:38.304 --> 07:40.465
Ozzie! Cut him!

07:49.816 --> 07:52.341
This is a really bad idea,
Morty.

08:00.693 --> 08:04.288
You sleep through anything,
don't you, honey?

08:05.298 --> 08:07.357
I'll kill you, asshole.

08:13.873 --> 08:16.142
You sucker.

08:16.142 --> 08:18.702
En garde. Parry. Thrust!

08:22.448 --> 08:26.942
It's a very fortunate thing
for you my wife wasn't here.

08:29.255 --> 08:32.958
My good girl, isn't she?

08:32.958 --> 08:34.460
Yeah.

08:34.460 --> 08:35.950
Lovely evening, isn't it?

08:43.602 --> 08:46.973
Hi, honey.
Did you get the formula?

08:46.973 --> 08:48.608
I completely forgot.

08:48.608 --> 08:51.711
-Daydreaming?
-Obviously.

08:51.711 --> 08:54.874
Jeff?
What happened to the stroller?

08:59.219 --> 09:02.488
It's a bad world,
isn't it, sweetheart?

09:02.488 --> 09:06.424
You and me and Mom
are going to make it better.

09:30.984 --> 09:32.719
New Orleans Police Department.

09:32.719 --> 09:36.422
Did you see a gentleman
with a baby stroller?

09:36.422 --> 09:40.026
That's Mr. Blue.
He's upstairs in his room.

09:40.026 --> 09:41.357
Thank you very much.

09:43.796 --> 09:45.398
What did happen
to that stroller?

09:45.398 --> 09:47.467
Put something on.
The cops are coming.

09:47.467 --> 09:51.437
-The cops are coming?
-Big badges, blue uniforms.

09:51.437 --> 09:52.631
Why?

09:58.177 --> 09:59.712
Officers.

09:59.712 --> 10:02.582
-Jeff Blue?
-That's me.

10:02.582 --> 10:05.118
Lieutenant Theodore Sawyer,
New Orleans Police Department.

10:05.118 --> 10:07.120
This is
Detective Sergeant Halsey.

10:07.120 --> 10:10.089
That's Halsey.
S-e-y, not s-y.

10:10.089 --> 10:11.591
May we come in?

10:11.591 --> 10:13.786
Sure thing, Ted.
You bet. My pleasure.

10:16.296 --> 10:20.033
I'm a great admirer
of the New Orleans Police.

10:20.033 --> 10:23.002
How's Clay Shaw?

10:23.002 --> 10:25.738
That's really hilarious.

10:25.738 --> 10:28.508
-This is my wife Jane.
-Evening.

10:28.508 --> 10:30.510
This is Lieutenant Sawyer.

10:30.510 --> 10:32.512
-Lieutenant.
-Sergeant Halsey.

10:32.512 --> 10:33.713
-Sergeant.
-Ma'am.

10:33.713 --> 10:35.515
Please excuse the robe,
gentlemen.

10:35.515 --> 10:38.651
I wasn't expecting the police
at this hour.

10:38.651 --> 10:40.720
Please, sit.

10:40.720 --> 10:44.023
Excuse us, ma'am.
We're working undercover--

10:44.023 --> 10:46.726
A lieutenant undercover?
I would have thought...

10:46.726 --> 10:49.963
they'd have something
more important for you.

10:49.963 --> 10:51.597
With oil gone belly-up...

10:51.597 --> 10:53.499
tourism is
the biggest stuff there is.

10:53.499 --> 10:56.736
Folks getting knifed
in the French Quarter...

10:56.736 --> 11:01.341
annoys the hell out of
the Tourist Commission.

11:01.341 --> 11:05.078
There was an attempted
mugging this evening.

11:05.078 --> 11:06.312
Really?

11:06.312 --> 11:08.781
-The victim got away.
-Oh, good.

11:08.781 --> 11:11.951
-You know nothing about that?
-No.

11:11.951 --> 11:13.987
You match the description
of the intended victim--

11:13.987 --> 11:16.089
a man with a baby stroller.

11:16.089 --> 11:20.360
A bag lady says she saw
the man enter this hotel.

11:20.360 --> 11:22.528
The desk clerk
says that man was you.

11:22.528 --> 11:25.465
Certainly narrows it down,
doesn't it?

11:25.465 --> 11:29.736
Mr. Blue, were you involved
in an attempted mugging?

11:29.736 --> 11:32.405
No, Ted, I don't think so.

11:32.405 --> 11:34.307
Would you mind
calling me Lieutenant?

11:34.307 --> 11:37.710
Ms. Blue...

11:37.710 --> 11:40.235
would you care
to make any comment?

11:42.015 --> 11:44.313
Not at this precise time.

11:48.154 --> 11:50.523
Mr. Blue,
can I see some ID, please?

11:50.523 --> 11:53.860
-You bet.
-One with a picture?

11:53.860 --> 11:55.995
Thank you.

11:55.995 --> 11:58.031
That's a good picture.

11:58.031 --> 11:59.766
What do you do for a living?

11:59.766 --> 12:01.534
I'm an Electrolux salesman.

12:01.534 --> 12:04.804
I don't know what brand
of vacuum cleaner you use...

12:04.804 --> 12:07.974
but the Electrolux
is the biggest sucker of all.

12:07.974 --> 12:10.877
Are you in New Orleans
on business?

12:10.877 --> 12:13.646
-Vacation.
-How long will you stay?

12:13.646 --> 12:16.916
Month, month and a half.

12:16.916 --> 12:18.684
Isn't that long for a vacation?

12:18.684 --> 12:20.887
Is it?

12:20.887 --> 12:24.223
Mr. Blue, if...

12:24.223 --> 12:25.625
If you know something...

12:25.625 --> 12:27.560
but you're afraid
to talk about it...

12:27.560 --> 12:29.829
we can give you
full protection.

12:29.829 --> 12:33.599
Thanks, but I really
don't know anything.

12:33.599 --> 12:35.568
Well, thank you, sir.

12:35.568 --> 12:38.704
Here's your ID,
and here's my card.

12:38.704 --> 12:41.240
If you change your mind,
please give us a call.

12:41.240 --> 12:43.910
-Will do.
-Bye, ma'am.

12:43.910 --> 12:47.080
That baby stroller's
taken quite a beating.

12:47.080 --> 12:49.982
Baggage handlers.

12:49.982 --> 12:52.007
-Good night.
-Good night.

12:56.622 --> 13:00.026
Let me see if
I understand this correctly.

13:00.026 --> 13:02.428
You took our child
into a knife fight?

13:02.428 --> 13:05.531
It was a fair fight--
two of them, two of us.

13:05.531 --> 13:07.467
Jeff, how could you?

13:07.467 --> 13:09.235
It wasn't my idea.

13:09.235 --> 13:11.471
You should have seen them,
complete amateurs.

13:11.471 --> 13:14.841
Biggest risk was I'd fall down
laughing and hurt myself.

13:14.841 --> 13:17.977
I won't do it again.

13:17.977 --> 13:20.480
This is Chapter Two
in which Jeff and Jane...

13:20.480 --> 13:23.983
have a child
and lead a normal life.

13:23.983 --> 13:25.507
You forgot the formula.

13:30.957 --> 13:32.982
That's my boy, Metre.

13:34.760 --> 13:38.491
I'm going to fuck him up.
Watch this. Hold my stick.

13:40.500 --> 13:42.568
Boy, this is gonna be good.

13:42.568 --> 13:45.505
-Red.
-What can I do you?

13:45.505 --> 13:49.008
-Creme de menthe.
-Coming up.

13:49.008 --> 13:54.080
Hey, Muerte,
I heard you had some trouble.

13:54.080 --> 13:56.516
Yeah. You should
see the other guys--

13:56.516 --> 14:00.119
fifteen guys
with chains and dogs.

14:00.119 --> 14:02.952
You should see
what they look like.

14:03.956 --> 14:05.992
I mean...

14:05.992 --> 14:08.327
That ain't what I heard.

14:08.327 --> 14:11.464
I heard it was one guy...

14:11.464 --> 14:13.966
with a cute little tiny baby!

14:13.966 --> 14:16.869
Which one of them
done it to you, Muerte?

14:16.869 --> 14:18.471
Was it the guy...

14:18.471 --> 14:21.201
or that cute little tiny baby?

14:23.943 --> 14:25.978
My name is Muerte!

14:25.978 --> 14:27.605
My name is Death!

14:32.818 --> 14:35.488
Don't you forget that!

14:35.488 --> 14:38.224
Scumhooks!

14:38.224 --> 14:40.493
So now he's looking for Blue.

14:40.493 --> 14:44.096
Great. Muerte's going
to be out for blood.

14:44.096 --> 14:45.998
He's a vindictive
little shit, Captain.

14:45.998 --> 14:48.000
Then you find him first.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.869
That's not all.

14:49.869 --> 14:52.004
There's something strange
about this guy Blue...

14:52.004 --> 14:53.906
what he did to
Muerte and Ozzie.

14:53.906 --> 14:56.876
He was holding a baby,
so he did it one-handed.

14:56.876 --> 14:58.878
What are you saying?

14:58.878 --> 15:01.013
It takes special training.

15:01.013 --> 15:04.951
What I'm wondering is,
who is this guy? FBI?

15:04.951 --> 15:07.353
I don't think the FBI
is running anything...

15:07.353 --> 15:09.455
but you know how much
they tell us.

15:09.455 --> 15:11.457
There's a guy
I knew in the service...

15:11.457 --> 15:13.459
works with the Bureau in D.C.

15:13.459 --> 15:15.361
Maybe I should check it out.

15:15.361 --> 15:17.797
Stop wondering
and check it out.

15:17.797 --> 15:18.991
Right.

15:25.238 --> 15:28.441
FBI?
Dan Chesler, please.

15:28.441 --> 15:30.739
-His line is busy.
-I'll wait.

15:33.813 --> 15:35.648
Come on!

15:35.648 --> 15:37.850
-Chesler.
-Hey, Danny.

15:37.850 --> 15:40.486
Ted Sawyer here.
How you doing?

15:40.486 --> 15:43.489
Listen, ran into somebody
unusual down here.

15:43.489 --> 15:45.191
Was wondering if
he could be one of yours?

15:45.191 --> 15:47.489
Calls himself Jefferson Blue.

15:49.662 --> 15:52.028
Did I say something funny?

15:52.064 --> 15:55.001
-I'm dying.
-It wasn't that far.

15:55.001 --> 15:57.663
-20 miles.
-That's far.

16:00.006 --> 16:01.735
Hold it.

16:23.796 --> 16:25.286
Stay put, pumpkin.

16:31.971 --> 16:36.309
One man on
the couch...reading.

16:36.309 --> 16:37.977
A literate burglar?

16:37.977 --> 16:42.014
How refreshing.
Reading what?

16:42.014 --> 16:44.983
Go for the far wall.
I'll cover you from here.

16:53.159 --> 16:55.928
One...

16:55.928 --> 16:59.298
Two...

16:59.298 --> 17:01.357
Three.

17:03.569 --> 17:06.439
Jeff! Jeff!

17:06.439 --> 17:10.170
Frank! How are you doing?

17:15.013 --> 17:17.483
Did we ever thank you
for the crib blanket?

17:17.483 --> 17:20.453
No, honey. The White House
sent the crib blanket.

17:20.453 --> 17:22.722
Frank sent
the Fisher-Price barnyard.

17:22.722 --> 17:24.323
You sent that?

17:24.323 --> 17:26.892
Do you know those
little cows really moo?

17:26.892 --> 17:28.894
Jeff always plays with it
day and night.

17:28.894 --> 17:31.130
I'd like you
to consider something.

17:31.130 --> 17:33.532
-The answer is no.
-You haven't heard the question.

17:33.532 --> 17:34.734
The answer is still no.

17:34.734 --> 17:37.169
Whatever you want,
we're not interested.

17:37.169 --> 17:38.938
We're off
the field assignment list.

17:38.938 --> 17:43.042
Maternity leave.
You gave us a very nice party.

17:43.042 --> 17:47.713
You said if we were in
a critical situation--

17:47.713 --> 17:49.515
Not during
the first 18 months.

17:49.515 --> 17:54.019
The books all show the first
18 months are essential--

17:54.019 --> 17:56.010
Jesus.

17:57.990 --> 18:00.326
-Tactical nuke?
-C-22.

18:00.326 --> 18:02.762
-We are not interested.
-''C'' what?

18:02.762 --> 18:04.397
Experimental
plastic explosive...

18:04.397 --> 18:06.332
the most powerful plastic
ever developed.

18:06.332 --> 18:08.934
So unstable even the Army
won't use it.

18:08.934 --> 18:10.436
That C-22.

18:10.436 --> 18:11.771
I thought
they stopped making it.

18:11.771 --> 18:13.372
They did.
The remaining stock was stolen.

18:13.372 --> 18:16.876
-Sell it to someone else.
-Please.

18:16.876 --> 18:18.944
FBI thinks
it's organized crime.

18:18.944 --> 18:20.946
FBI thinks everything's
organized crime.

18:20.946 --> 18:22.448
We think it's Novacek.

18:22.448 --> 18:24.950
Novacek?
We're incredibly not interested.

18:24.950 --> 18:27.453
She hates me.
Remember Budapest?

18:27.453 --> 18:28.788
You said
you'd help out a little.

18:28.788 --> 18:32.992
Novacek is not a little.
She's a psycho.

18:32.992 --> 18:35.027
Novacek's customers
make their points...

18:35.027 --> 18:37.930
by blowing up innocent people,
including children.

18:37.930 --> 18:39.932
That's a low blow.

18:39.932 --> 18:44.136
Just find her.
We'll do the rest.

18:44.136 --> 18:46.472
You get six months paid leave
when you finish.

18:46.472 --> 18:48.641
That ought to help
the postnatal bonding.

18:48.641 --> 18:51.744
Uh-uh. Just going to have
to find somebody else.

18:51.744 --> 18:55.481
We'll throw in a bonus.
20% of annual pay.

18:55.481 --> 18:57.483
I made a solemn promise
to Jane--

18:57.483 --> 18:59.618
-Fifty percent.
-Don't push it.

18:59.618 --> 19:00.886
I'm a mother now.

19:00.886 --> 19:03.422
Know what a decent college
will cost in 20 years?

19:03.422 --> 19:05.524
Thirty. I'm already
way over budget.

19:05.524 --> 19:07.092
Fifty, going once.

19:07.092 --> 19:08.828
You mercenary thing, you.

19:08.828 --> 19:10.729
Going twice.

19:10.729 --> 19:13.232
I want a low-profile operation.

19:13.232 --> 19:16.735
You want low-profile,
you got low-profile.

19:16.735 --> 19:19.829
-We'll need the usual toys.
-They're on the way.

19:19.939 --> 19:22.741
You got one lead--
this guy Foster.

19:22.741 --> 19:26.278
He works at Dynagon.
They developed C-22.

19:26.278 --> 19:29.849
-Can you say plastic explosive?
-Pay attention.

19:29.849 --> 19:33.285
I'm paying attention.
Go on.

19:33.285 --> 19:35.921
Novacek's base
is somewhere in the delta.

19:35.921 --> 19:38.958
She's got her people spotted
in local defence industries...

19:38.958 --> 19:40.459
even the military.

19:40.459 --> 19:41.961
More good news.

19:41.961 --> 19:44.463
Near as we can tell,
she bribed a full colonel...

19:44.463 --> 19:46.999
into stealing the last batch
of C-22 canisters.

19:46.999 --> 19:49.935
He got spooked
and used one getting away.

19:49.935 --> 19:53.506
Blew up half of Oklahoma.
Be careful, guys.

19:53.506 --> 19:55.574
Novacek's more dangerous
than she looks.

19:55.574 --> 19:57.309
Colonel!

19:57.309 --> 20:00.244
How happy I am to see you.

20:03.816 --> 20:06.085
You're limping.
Did you have some problems?

20:06.085 --> 20:09.522
-Nothing I couldn't handle.
-What happened?

20:09.522 --> 20:12.191
There was a last-minute change
in checkpoint security.

20:12.191 --> 20:15.594
-What?
-There's one missing.

20:15.594 --> 20:18.597
-Missing?
-That's what I'm saying.

20:18.597 --> 20:21.667
They were bringing in
tanks and artillery.

20:21.667 --> 20:24.003
You used
1/5 of our shipment...

20:24.003 --> 20:28.140
just to--Oh, God--
to blast yourself out?

20:28.140 --> 20:31.877
It was the only way out.
I know they're valuable.

20:31.877 --> 20:33.879
Colonel...

20:33.879 --> 20:37.049
Big, strong, colonel man.

20:37.049 --> 20:39.585
I know you're the only one
I can trust.

20:39.585 --> 20:42.555
Don't ma'am me.
Just call me Paulina.

20:42.555 --> 20:44.123
Paulina, ma'am.

20:44.123 --> 20:46.725
You just call me--Oops.

20:46.725 --> 20:49.159
-I'll get that.
-Unforgettable.

20:52.364 --> 20:55.856
The colonel will no longer
be working with us.

20:57.036 --> 20:59.038
The FBI fired Blue twice?

20:59.038 --> 21:01.974
Fired him in '81.
Rehired him in '84.

21:01.974 --> 21:04.476
-Fired him again in '85.
-Why?

21:04.476 --> 21:05.978
There's all kinds of rumours.

21:05.978 --> 21:08.080
Tell him what he did
in-between.

21:08.080 --> 21:09.982
I'm going to hate this,
ain't I?

21:09.982 --> 21:11.984
-CIA.
-Perfect.

21:11.984 --> 21:14.987
Till they got on the bandwagon
and fired him, too.

21:14.987 --> 21:17.489
-Who's he with now?
-Very good question.

21:17.489 --> 21:19.480
-Go find out!
-Yes, sir.

21:23.495 --> 21:25.486
Mr. Foster?

21:27.099 --> 21:30.002
You. What do you want?

21:30.002 --> 21:33.505
Frau Novacek shall require
your services again.

21:33.505 --> 21:36.508
No, no. I can't be
involved with that anymore.

21:36.508 --> 21:38.510
I mean...you know.

21:38.510 --> 21:40.613
You got no choice, little man.

21:40.613 --> 21:43.515
Please deliver the merchandise
at the usual place.

21:43.515 --> 21:46.848
Oh, God! When?

21:46.885 --> 21:50.522
''Gilbert Foster,
2616 Magazine Street.

21:50.522 --> 21:54.526
''Occupation--research scientist
at Dynagon Industries.

21:54.526 --> 21:59.231
"Dishonorable discharge.
Marital status--divorced.''

21:59.231 --> 22:00.466
Yoo-hoo, Ms. Blue!

22:00.466 --> 22:02.525
Heads up.

22:04.937 --> 22:06.495
Laurel and Hardy.

22:07.973 --> 22:10.342
Well, the Blues.

22:10.342 --> 22:13.178
I got a right
to sing the blues

22:13.178 --> 22:14.813
Charming.

22:14.813 --> 22:18.017
Cute baby. Boy or girl?

22:18.017 --> 22:19.318
Gosh, I hope so.

22:19.318 --> 22:20.819
She's a girl, Lieutenant.

22:20.819 --> 22:22.154
I got two girls.

22:22.154 --> 22:24.990
-Really? Two whole girls.
-We tried for a boy.

22:24.990 --> 22:27.493
-Coffee?
-I'd love some cafe au lait.

22:27.493 --> 22:28.994
Great.

22:28.994 --> 22:31.497
Mr. Blue,
could we talk frankly?

22:31.497 --> 22:33.399
Sure, Ted.

22:33.399 --> 22:35.834
What you did
to those two guys--

22:35.834 --> 22:38.103
What did you say you did
for a living?

22:38.103 --> 22:39.638
I'm an airline pilot.

22:39.638 --> 22:41.507
You said you're
a vacuum cleaner salesman.

22:41.507 --> 22:44.408
If you knew, why'd you ask?

22:47.012 --> 22:51.016
What you did to those guys
was on a professional level.

22:51.016 --> 22:53.519
Growing up
in the mean streets--

22:53.519 --> 22:55.554
Mean streets?
You're from Nebraska.

22:55.554 --> 22:57.556
How did you know
where Jeff was from?

22:57.556 --> 23:00.959
Had a little chat with
somebody from the FBI.

23:00.959 --> 23:04.229
The man has unexpected depths.

23:04.229 --> 23:05.664
What else did you find out?

23:05.664 --> 23:07.633
Nothing about our sex life,
I hope.

23:07.633 --> 23:08.967
I'm going to blush.

23:08.967 --> 23:10.969
You weren't blushing last night.

23:10.969 --> 23:12.304
I was blushing all over.

23:12.304 --> 23:15.407
-Oh, yeah.
-Everywhere.

23:15.407 --> 23:19.745
My source at the FBI says
they didn't think you were...

23:19.745 --> 23:23.182
and I quote,
''Bureau material.''

23:23.182 --> 23:26.785
That's true.
I'm more of an end table.

23:26.785 --> 23:29.054
I always think of you
as a dining room chair.

23:29.054 --> 23:31.757
Really? I see you as
a rosewood armoire...

23:31.757 --> 23:34.658
with really nice drawers.

23:36.161 --> 23:38.664
-Blue!
-What?

23:38.664 --> 23:42.334
Who are you working for?
Are you a spy?

23:42.334 --> 23:45.871
It don't have to go beyond me.

23:45.871 --> 23:48.373
I can help you. Trust me.

23:48.373 --> 23:50.642
-Know what's funny?
-What?

23:50.642 --> 23:53.112
That gray van over there.

23:53.112 --> 23:55.414
Funny ha-ha
or funny interesting?

23:55.414 --> 23:57.850
Have you been listening to me?

23:57.850 --> 24:00.819
It's been there seven minutes
with the motor running.

24:00.819 --> 24:03.655
-So what?
-It's in front of a bank.

24:03.655 --> 24:06.425
I repeat--so what?

24:06.425 --> 24:07.915
Order me another coffee.

24:09.461 --> 24:11.396
He's so rude sometimes.

24:11.396 --> 24:13.330
I'm sorry.
I just have to apologize.

24:34.920 --> 24:36.387
Excuse me.

24:37.456 --> 24:39.625
Honey, you got to see this.

24:39.625 --> 24:41.593
Come see what Daddy's doing.

24:45.330 --> 24:47.332
Let's go! Go, man!

24:47.332 --> 24:50.028
Go, God damn it! Go!

25:00.012 --> 25:01.914
Oh, wow!

25:01.914 --> 25:04.940
Next time, buy American.

25:07.252 --> 25:11.657
Mrs. Blue, can we stop
with the fun and games?

25:11.657 --> 25:14.459
First try.

25:14.459 --> 25:16.829
Give me five.

25:16.829 --> 25:19.464
Who is your husband
working for now?

25:19.464 --> 25:21.900
If you'd like to know
who my husband is working for...

25:21.900 --> 25:23.669
I suggest you ask him.

25:23.669 --> 25:26.972
I am outraged
that he single-handedly...

25:26.972 --> 25:30.475
foils a bank robbery
and you arrest him.

25:30.475 --> 25:32.477
You got a lot of goddamn gall.

25:32.477 --> 25:34.379
We got your husband
behind bars...

25:34.379 --> 25:36.648
and he'll stay there
until somebody tells me...

25:36.648 --> 25:38.917
exactly what
he's doing in my city!

25:38.917 --> 25:41.887
You are overreacting.
Isn't he, honey?

25:41.887 --> 25:43.488
Men are like that.

25:43.488 --> 25:45.991
They get threatened,
then they get defensive...

25:45.991 --> 25:47.993
and then
they get aggressive--

25:47.993 --> 25:49.995
Ma'am, if you don't watch it...

25:49.995 --> 25:54.333
you'll find yourself in a cell,
baby or no baby.

25:54.333 --> 25:56.001
Excuse me, sir.
Phone call for you.

25:56.001 --> 25:58.170
-I'm busy.
-OK.

25:58.170 --> 26:00.873
I'm going to ask you
one more time very nicely--

26:00.873 --> 26:02.674
It's about Blue, sir.

26:02.674 --> 26:05.510
Who is it, the president?

26:05.510 --> 26:07.613
No.

26:07.613 --> 26:09.478
It's the governor.

26:11.216 --> 26:15.053
About that stunt you pulled
with the car just now...

26:15.053 --> 26:17.456
is that part
of Chapter Two...

26:17.456 --> 26:20.459
in which Jeff and Jane
lead a sane life?

26:20.459 --> 26:22.461
I don't think
it's fair or nice of you...

26:22.461 --> 26:24.463
to complain about me
having a little fun.

26:24.463 --> 26:25.831
There was a zero risk factor.

26:25.831 --> 26:27.532
Three guys
running out of a bank...

26:27.532 --> 26:29.167
packing heat,
probably stoned.

26:29.167 --> 26:31.436
People in a hurry
never look at the driver.

26:31.436 --> 26:33.038
I've never
heard that rule before.

26:33.038 --> 26:35.974
I made it up,
but it's still true.

26:35.974 --> 26:38.110
And it's all part of
my brilliant plan.

26:38.110 --> 26:39.478
Which brilliant plan?

26:39.478 --> 26:40.979
Take a look at this.

26:40.979 --> 26:42.981
This guy at Dynagon,
Foster...

26:42.981 --> 26:45.347
he's worth spooking,
so tomorrow, what we do...

26:52.991 --> 26:55.994
Would you get that?
My hands are all gooey.

26:55.994 --> 26:58.330
Yeah.

26:58.330 --> 27:02.034
-Hello. Speaking.
-This Blue?

27:02.034 --> 27:04.703
Do you remember me?

27:04.703 --> 27:06.939
You have a really sexy voice...

27:06.939 --> 27:08.941
but, hey,
I'm a happily married man.

27:08.941 --> 27:11.443
You'll be a dead man soon.

27:11.443 --> 27:14.379
Who is this again?

27:14.379 --> 27:16.815
This is Muerte.

27:16.815 --> 27:18.250
Morty!

27:18.250 --> 27:21.620
No! No Morty!
Muerte! Death!

27:21.620 --> 27:24.256
Yeah, right. Death.

27:24.256 --> 27:26.959
That's right.
I'm coming for you, man...

27:26.959 --> 27:29.728
and I'm going to kill you.

27:29.728 --> 27:33.198
Morty, it's late.
What's the bottom line?

27:33.198 --> 27:37.669
The bottom line is
you're gonna die, man...ugly.

27:37.669 --> 27:42.941
Morty, do me a favour.
Don't call here anymore...

27:42.941 --> 27:46.445
unless you want to have
a serious conversation.

27:46.445 --> 27:49.314
Excuse me! No! Hello?

27:49.314 --> 27:51.316
-Who was that?
-That was Morty.

27:51.316 --> 27:53.085
Muerte. How nice.

27:53.085 --> 27:55.815
-He'll be very useful.
-Boy, are you optimistic.

28:26.985 --> 28:29.180
Dynagon Industries.

28:33.392 --> 28:35.394
You wanted to see me?

28:35.394 --> 28:39.564
Yes, Mr. Foster.
My name is Hildy Johnson.

28:39.564 --> 28:40.899
I'm with
the ''Chicago Herald.''

28:40.899 --> 28:44.269
I'm working on a story about
the theft of defence secrets.

28:44.269 --> 28:50.242
I have absolutely no comment
to make on this matter.

28:50.242 --> 28:54.179
Really? How about
a big front-page photo?

28:54.179 --> 28:55.380
Oh, God!

28:55.380 --> 28:59.111
I think you should leave,
sir, right now.

29:04.589 --> 29:07.456
Run back the tape
from reception.

29:16.034 --> 29:17.501
Stop it right there.

29:20.238 --> 29:22.331
Print.

29:33.852 --> 29:35.954
Mr. Ferderber, please.

29:35.954 --> 29:37.956
Yes, I'll wait.

29:37.956 --> 29:40.447
Yeah, right. Yes.

29:41.460 --> 29:42.825
Oh, God.

30:53.598 --> 30:56.334
-Jefferson Blue.
-You know him?

30:56.334 --> 31:01.506
Yes. He ruined
the operation in Budapest.

31:01.506 --> 31:04.509
This means everything will
have to be accelerated.

31:04.509 --> 31:07.979
You must make copies of this
and distribute them.

31:07.979 --> 31:09.481
We must get Blue.

31:09.481 --> 31:11.483
Yes, Frau Novacek.

31:11.483 --> 31:13.985
Yeah. Thank you.

31:13.985 --> 31:16.855
Thank you very much.
Here you go, honey.

31:16.855 --> 31:22.160
I told you B.B. King
recorded children's records.

31:22.160 --> 31:25.430
There you go.
Let's go find Mommy.

31:25.430 --> 31:27.866
Maybe she'll give us
something to eat.

31:27.866 --> 31:31.503
Hi, Morty. How's it going?

31:31.503 --> 31:34.506
Muerte! For Death!

31:34.506 --> 31:36.141
You die today!

31:36.141 --> 31:41.813
Right. That looks
really great on TV...

31:41.813 --> 31:45.317
but you get better results
if you hold it like--

31:45.317 --> 31:47.085
Shut up!

31:47.085 --> 31:48.520
Do you always have
this much problem...

31:48.520 --> 31:51.182
with a little
constructive criticism?

31:54.826 --> 31:56.695
Now what?

31:56.695 --> 31:59.531
Hi, hon.
I told you about Morty.

31:59.531 --> 32:03.468
-Morty, this is Jane.
-Hi, Morty.

32:03.468 --> 32:05.971
I'm sorry, but we've got
so much shopping to do--

32:05.971 --> 32:08.707
Shut up! You die, too!

32:08.707 --> 32:10.038
Oh, for God's sakes.

32:18.483 --> 32:20.075
Oh, no.

32:22.487 --> 32:23.955
Honey.

32:23.955 --> 32:26.253
Come here, Morty.

32:28.994 --> 32:31.529
I can't leave you alone
for a minute.

32:31.529 --> 32:33.365
This wasn't my fault.

32:33.365 --> 32:34.866
Nothing's ever your fault.

32:34.866 --> 32:37.002
You going to kill him?

32:37.002 --> 32:39.004
Aren't we bloodthirsty?

32:39.004 --> 32:42.440
I told you not to drink
all that coffee.

32:45.577 --> 32:47.078
Where are we going to eat?

32:47.078 --> 32:48.847
I heard about this great place
from the Newmans.

32:48.847 --> 32:50.906
They say
the oysters are terrific.

32:52.017 --> 32:54.019
Here we go.

32:54.019 --> 32:56.521
You want to sit here
or in the garden?

32:56.521 --> 32:58.023
-Garden?
-Sure.

32:58.023 --> 32:59.524
That way, please.

32:59.524 --> 33:01.459
Do you think
we'll find Novacek?

33:01.459 --> 33:03.461
Absolutely.
We spooked Foster.

33:03.461 --> 33:05.463
Word gets to Novacek.
Novacek gets worried.

33:05.463 --> 33:07.465
She doesn't know
what move to make.

33:07.465 --> 33:09.467
She's fretful.
She's nervous.

33:09.467 --> 33:11.799
You're describing
a baby with colic.

33:16.474 --> 33:19.978
All right.
What can I get for you folks?

33:19.978 --> 33:22.981
A new acquaintance told me
this was the place for oysters.

33:22.981 --> 33:24.983
Yes, ma'am, it is.

33:24.983 --> 33:28.653
We'll have six dozen oysters
and two beers.

33:28.653 --> 33:30.655
All right, sir. Right away.

33:30.655 --> 33:32.157
You like them, too?

33:32.157 --> 33:33.522
This place is great.

33:39.931 --> 33:42.957
Darling, do the oysters
come with guns?

33:44.102 --> 33:46.771
Don't make any sudden moves.

33:46.771 --> 33:50.008
-Is there a bee on me?
-l don't see one.

33:50.008 --> 33:53.278
What's a sudden move?
I never understood that.

33:53.278 --> 33:56.414
I don't either.
They watch too many cop shows.

33:56.414 --> 34:01.453
Get up from the table
very, very slowly.

34:01.453 --> 34:04.989
Very, very? Not just very?

34:04.989 --> 34:06.558
Start moving.

34:06.558 --> 34:09.561
You remember Marseilles
three, four years ago?

34:09.561 --> 34:10.795
Uh-huh.

34:10.795 --> 34:12.664
Don't try anything stupid.

34:12.664 --> 34:15.967
-Sure you remember?
-l think so.

34:15.967 --> 34:18.002
All right.
On the count of three--

34:18.002 --> 34:21.062
-One...two...three.
-Don't!

34:23.975 --> 34:27.045
All right.

34:27.045 --> 34:28.978
The comedy's over.

34:41.493 --> 34:43.484
After them, you fools!

34:50.168 --> 34:51.770
Why didn't you shoot him
under the table?

34:51.770 --> 34:53.838
You said Marseilles.
That was East Berlin.

34:53.838 --> 34:55.806
Oops.

35:13.458 --> 35:15.960
They just closed for lunch.

35:15.960 --> 35:18.963
Anything you care to tell me?

35:18.963 --> 35:21.366
The oysters look terrific.

35:21.366 --> 35:23.468
I mean about
what just happened here.

35:23.468 --> 35:26.471
I'd say it was
a domestic disturbance.

35:26.471 --> 35:29.474
-Domestic disturbance?
-Like ''The Honeymooners.''

35:29.474 --> 35:31.976
Remember how
Ralph fought with Alice?

35:31.976 --> 35:34.979
I don't recollect Ralph
using semiautomatic weapons.

35:34.979 --> 35:36.481
Norton sometimes did.

35:36.481 --> 35:37.982
And Mrs. Manicotti
on the second floor.

35:37.982 --> 35:39.484
Wow, what a temper she had.

35:39.484 --> 35:41.453
You got a gun?
Give it to me.

35:41.453 --> 35:42.954
I don't carry a gun.

35:42.954 --> 35:44.989
Jeff's a lousy shot.

35:44.989 --> 35:47.058
He bribed the examiner
at the FBI.

35:47.058 --> 35:49.494
That's a lie.
I bribed the guy at the CIA.

35:49.494 --> 35:51.996
I blackmailed
the guy at the FBI.

35:51.996 --> 35:53.398
You think you're smarter
than we are.

35:53.398 --> 35:58.169
Not much.
I just have more training.

35:58.169 --> 36:01.798
I thought you were
a vacuum cleaner salesman.

36:12.283 --> 36:14.843
What's he doing,
joining the band?

36:18.289 --> 36:20.959
-That's your husband.
-l know.

36:20.959 --> 36:23.826
-Does he play the trumpet?
-Apparently.

36:28.433 --> 36:30.468
I hate him.

36:30.468 --> 36:32.663
I really hate him.

36:43.648 --> 36:46.985
-Is she asleep?
-Like an angel.

36:46.985 --> 36:50.922
I will be having hideous
nightmares about shoot-outs.

36:50.922 --> 36:53.491
Don't blame me.
You picked the restaurant.

36:53.491 --> 36:55.994
Here's what I think.
Tomorrow morning...

36:55.994 --> 36:57.996
you and the pumpkin
get on a plane...

36:57.996 --> 37:00.431
and I'll call you
when it's over.

37:00.431 --> 37:01.933
Please.

37:01.933 --> 37:03.935
Isn't that what you want?

37:03.935 --> 37:07.939
We are a team.
End of story.

37:07.939 --> 37:12.433
God knows what would happen
to you if I wasn't around.

37:17.448 --> 37:18.950
I might get hurt.

37:18.950 --> 37:20.975
Or worse than that.

37:25.089 --> 37:29.253
Don't start.
I have to make a phone call.

37:31.195 --> 37:34.966
Who do you want to be,
good cop or bad cop?

37:34.966 --> 37:38.303
Bad cop.
Who are you calling?

37:38.303 --> 37:40.471
I never get to be the bad cop.

37:40.471 --> 37:42.807
You can never keep
a straight face.

37:42.807 --> 37:44.240
Who are you calling?

37:52.083 --> 37:54.986
-Yes?
-Mr. Foster?

37:54.986 --> 37:56.788
Who is this?

37:56.788 --> 37:58.990
Our organization
has been penetrated...

37:58.990 --> 38:04.262
by a brilliant American agent
and his beautiful wife.

38:04.262 --> 38:05.930
Meet me--

38:05.930 --> 38:08.633
At the cemetery
where we always meet.

38:08.633 --> 38:10.134
But of course.

38:10.134 --> 38:13.137
2:00 tomorrow afternoon.
Do not be late.

38:13.137 --> 38:15.940
So, tomorrow
we gang up on Mr. Foster.

38:15.940 --> 38:17.942
Do you think he'll come?

38:17.942 --> 38:21.446
Absolutely. If he doesn't,
we still get some sightseeing.

38:21.446 --> 38:24.983
So you were saying
if you weren't around...

38:24.983 --> 38:27.383
You might get hurt.

38:28.453 --> 38:30.455
Badly hurt.

38:30.455 --> 38:32.457
Maimed, maybe.

38:32.457 --> 38:34.459
Maybe...

38:34.459 --> 38:36.461
Maybe worse.

38:36.461 --> 38:40.465
Decapitated...lose my head.

38:40.465 --> 38:43.468
I know what decapitated means.

38:43.468 --> 38:44.958
Kill the light.

38:48.373 --> 38:50.466
I meant turn it off.

38:55.446 --> 38:58.182
-Honey.
-Look who's here.

38:58.182 --> 39:00.485
Ding, ding, ding,
went the trolley

39:00.485 --> 39:03.287
-Clang, sir.
-What?

39:03.287 --> 39:07.992
Clang went the trolley,
ding went the bell.

39:07.992 --> 39:10.628
So, you've been assigned
to follow us.

39:10.628 --> 39:12.063
Who says we're following you?

39:12.063 --> 39:14.666
I get it.
You have a day off...

39:14.666 --> 39:16.267
and you're
spending it together.

39:16.267 --> 39:17.969
No. Here's what
you're doing--

39:17.969 --> 39:19.804
pissing away
the taxpayers' money.

39:19.804 --> 39:21.806
That's what we're paid for.

39:21.806 --> 39:25.610
And following around
CIA agents in New Orleans.

39:25.610 --> 39:27.979
Will you get off that already?

39:27.979 --> 39:29.681
I say you're CIA.

39:29.681 --> 39:32.445
Good. Say it.

39:49.867 --> 39:51.969
Tell me,
what are you doing here?

39:51.969 --> 39:53.971
This is a cemetery.

39:53.971 --> 39:56.140
Are you here
on company business?

39:56.140 --> 39:58.476
Lieutenant, will you
get off this CIA kick?

39:58.476 --> 40:01.479
I'm a regular guy,
almost a regular guy.

40:01.479 --> 40:03.481
I got a wife, a baby.

40:03.481 --> 40:05.983
Enjoy yourself
and watch the funeral.

40:05.983 --> 40:07.719
I've seen plenty of funerals.

40:07.719 --> 40:10.187
I'm here to keep an eye on you.

40:14.025 --> 40:15.652
Lord have mercy.

40:17.261 --> 40:18.996
Jesus Christ!

40:18.996 --> 40:20.827
I guess he got here early.

40:46.524 --> 40:48.493
Hi. How are you?

40:48.493 --> 40:51.529
How was my Jonathan?
Was he any trouble?

40:51.529 --> 40:53.297
Oh, no. He's a good baby.

40:53.297 --> 40:55.199
Did you enjoy the jazz cruise?

40:55.199 --> 40:58.369
We missed the boat.

40:58.369 --> 41:00.438
Too bad.
When we did that--

41:00.438 --> 41:02.740
When was it, Vern?
Two years ago.

41:02.740 --> 41:05.743
-Three years ago.
-No, honey, it was not.

41:05.743 --> 41:07.545
It was right after
my haemorrhoid surgery.

41:07.545 --> 41:08.913
You told me about that.

41:08.913 --> 41:10.982
He doesn't want to hear
about your haemorrhoids.

41:10.982 --> 41:13.317
Come to Daddy!

41:13.317 --> 41:14.819
Thank you so much.

41:14.819 --> 41:17.488
If you ever want us
to watch Louise Jane...

41:17.488 --> 41:18.956
just let us know.

41:18.956 --> 41:20.158
Jane Louise, honey.

41:20.158 --> 41:22.660
No, Louise Jane.
We'd be more than happy.

41:22.660 --> 41:25.029
Thank you.
We'll take you up on that.

41:25.029 --> 41:27.520
Good night. Sleep tight.

41:30.401 --> 41:33.671
-You tired?
-Very.

41:33.671 --> 41:35.306
Oh, really?

41:35.306 --> 41:38.509
That's just too bad, honey.

41:38.509 --> 41:40.511
Because you know why?

41:40.511 --> 41:45.516
Because I had
some real fun in mind.

41:45.516 --> 41:48.508
Like what, for instance?

41:56.527 --> 42:00.031
Breaking and entering
into the house of a dead man...

42:00.031 --> 42:03.267
is not my idea
of a lot of fun.

42:03.267 --> 42:06.971
It would be if you didn't take
all night to open the door.

42:06.971 --> 42:08.806
Madam needs to be changed.

42:08.806 --> 42:12.176
Change her yourself.
This is a five-pin Chubb.

42:12.176 --> 42:14.212
See Mommy picking the big lock?

42:14.212 --> 42:17.982
When you're a big girl,
she'll teach you to pick locks.

42:17.982 --> 42:20.885
Of course, she still
may be picking this one.

42:20.885 --> 42:23.487
One minute even.
Pretty slick.

42:23.487 --> 42:25.546
Thank you.

42:26.858 --> 42:29.360
OK...

42:29.360 --> 42:33.598
We can assume the cops tossed
the place pretty thoroughly.

42:33.598 --> 42:36.500
At least
all the obvious places.

42:36.500 --> 42:39.503
So we'll start with
the refrigerator.

42:39.503 --> 42:42.006
That's funny.

42:42.006 --> 42:44.008
-What?
-A shoe.

42:44.008 --> 42:47.500
-And?
-It's got a foot in it.

42:48.946 --> 42:50.504
Evening.

42:51.983 --> 42:54.585
All right.

42:54.585 --> 42:56.420
You going to tell us
the whole story?

42:56.420 --> 42:57.788
We can tell you
part of the story.

42:57.788 --> 43:00.491
-Tell me all of it.
-Part or nothing.

43:00.491 --> 43:03.227
How about we bust your ass
for B-and-E?

43:03.227 --> 43:05.763
How about we talk to
your nice governor?

43:05.763 --> 43:09.800
All right.
Tell me part of the story.

43:09.800 --> 43:12.937
It's hard to know
where to begin.

43:12.937 --> 43:15.072
My parents were
really simple folks.

43:15.072 --> 43:17.041
My father was a steam fitter.

43:17.041 --> 43:18.442
The relevant part.

43:18.442 --> 43:22.513
What do you know about recent
Czechoslovakian politics?

43:22.513 --> 43:26.050
No more Commie threat
and a bloodless revolution.

43:26.050 --> 43:29.186
-Very good.
-l saw it on PBS.

43:29.186 --> 43:31.555
File.

43:31.555 --> 43:33.057
Who is this?

43:33.057 --> 43:35.059
Paulina Novacek,
head of the Czech secret police.

43:35.059 --> 43:37.295
She left Prague two jumps
ahead of the firing squad.

43:37.295 --> 43:40.064
-She's in New Orleans?
-We think so.

43:40.064 --> 43:41.966
She's got men planted
in labs and factories...

43:41.966 --> 43:44.402
all over the south.
Industrial theft.

43:44.402 --> 43:46.003
Steals weapons,
chemicals, sells them.

43:46.003 --> 43:49.307
So you got to find her
and send her back?

43:49.307 --> 43:51.776
-There's no extradition.
-Has to go voluntarily.

43:51.776 --> 43:55.112
And you think
Foster worked for Novacek.

43:55.112 --> 43:57.615
He was the middleman
that funnelled stuff to her...

43:57.615 --> 43:59.750
and through him
we'll find the big guys.

43:59.750 --> 44:02.787
So we have
to find the middleman.

44:02.787 --> 44:05.790
There you go, Janie.
Don't squirt Daddy.

44:05.790 --> 44:07.058
Honey?

44:07.058 --> 44:09.961
Come here.

44:09.961 --> 44:11.429
I think I got it.

44:11.429 --> 44:15.132
-Come here, baby.
-Gentlemen.

44:15.132 --> 44:16.867
Will you give me a hand,
Lieutenant?

44:16.867 --> 44:19.437
Pick it up. Easy, easy.

44:19.437 --> 44:22.540
-Holy mackerel!
-Look at that.

44:22.540 --> 44:25.309
-Look at that.
-Careful.

44:25.309 --> 44:26.970
Allow me.

44:32.984 --> 44:35.486
Damn. Nothing but money.

44:35.486 --> 44:36.988
What's wrong with money?

44:36.988 --> 44:38.889
We were hoping for a name.

44:38.889 --> 44:40.124
Allow me.

44:40.124 --> 44:42.994
Come on, baby.
We'll put you to bed.

44:42.994 --> 44:44.562
Thank you.

44:44.562 --> 44:46.864
-That's interesting.
-What?

44:46.864 --> 44:50.768
There's a Rampart Savings
and Loan with an ATM.

44:50.768 --> 44:55.501
Why would Foster go across town
to use another branch?

44:59.510 --> 45:00.943
That is interesting.

45:02.947 --> 45:04.312
Come on.

45:05.316 --> 45:07.318
Weight on the left leg.

45:07.318 --> 45:09.954
Swing the right leg
from the hip.

45:09.954 --> 45:12.957
Come on. That's good.

45:12.957 --> 45:16.227
There we go.
Good. Oh, well.

45:16.227 --> 45:19.463
-When I was her age--
-She is right on schedule.

45:19.463 --> 45:21.465
I was walking at eight months.

45:21.465 --> 45:23.467
You walked
at a year and a half.

45:23.467 --> 45:25.269
Your mother was ready
to call in specialists.

45:25.269 --> 45:26.537
Take this.

45:26.537 --> 45:30.474
You think Sawyer can handle
this thing at the bank?

45:30.474 --> 45:32.977
Sure. He's OK.
He really is.

45:32.977 --> 45:34.478
Ready?

45:34.478 --> 45:36.810
This is
an incredible alligator.

45:39.383 --> 45:40.645
Ready?

45:42.486 --> 45:44.477
Let's try it.

45:45.990 --> 45:50.394
I figure the range is about
15 miles, plus or minus one.

45:50.394 --> 45:51.862
Think that'll do it?

45:51.862 --> 45:54.865
-Should be fine.
-It better be.

45:54.865 --> 45:56.534
That's a beautiful alligator.

45:56.534 --> 46:00.265
Look at that alligator go.

46:01.705 --> 46:04.141
I really appreciate this help,
Lieutenant.

46:04.141 --> 46:06.944
It's easy.
March right up to him...

46:06.944 --> 46:08.946
and start talking
as loud as possible.

46:08.946 --> 46:11.949
-Loud?
-Loud and obnoxious.

46:11.949 --> 46:15.853
Just act natural.

46:15.853 --> 46:17.955
You got to laugh
at yourself more, sir.

46:17.955 --> 46:20.389
-Let me help you out.
-Stop it!

46:21.892 --> 46:23.394
Cut it out.

46:23.394 --> 46:25.396
Loud.

46:25.396 --> 46:28.388
Loud and proud, sir.
Just you wait.

46:30.935 --> 46:32.937
I'd like some assistance,
please!

46:32.937 --> 46:34.472
We're police officers!

46:34.472 --> 46:36.907
Is there anyone in here
that can help me?

46:36.907 --> 46:38.109
Now!

46:38.109 --> 46:41.445
Hear what I just said?
I need some information!

46:41.445 --> 46:43.848
Who's in charge of
the automatic teller machine?

46:43.848 --> 46:45.983
I want to talk to them now!

46:45.983 --> 46:48.319
Excuse me.
Is there a problem?

46:48.319 --> 46:50.254
Can I help you in some way?

46:50.254 --> 46:54.725
Mr. Ferderber?
New Orleans Police Department.

46:54.725 --> 46:56.961
How many times
do I have to say this?

46:56.961 --> 46:58.462
How many times?

46:58.462 --> 47:02.633
Who's in charge of
the automatic teller machine?

47:02.633 --> 47:05.002
Must be hard of hearing.

47:05.002 --> 47:06.504
That's all right.
I understand.

47:06.504 --> 47:09.306
I can help you.
Would you come with me?

47:09.306 --> 47:11.342
Just have a seat
in my office here.

47:11.342 --> 47:13.944
I'll make sure someone
assists you immediately.

47:13.944 --> 47:15.546
-Thanks.
-All right?

47:15.546 --> 47:16.945
Better be quick, too.

47:18.115 --> 47:19.817
Hi, hon.
What's happening?

47:19.817 --> 47:23.087
I just got Louise down
for her nap.

47:23.087 --> 47:24.455
Scare up a white lab coat.

47:24.455 --> 47:28.626
Does it have to be white?
I feel very pale today.

47:28.626 --> 47:31.959
Just make it fast.
Got to go.

47:32.963 --> 47:34.465
FBI! You're under arrest!

47:34.465 --> 47:35.966
You have the right
to remain silent.

47:35.966 --> 47:37.468
If you give up that right...

47:37.468 --> 47:40.004
you may talk, sing, dance,
or impersonate Elvis.

47:40.004 --> 47:41.505
You also have
the right to an attorney.

47:41.505 --> 47:43.440
If you're broke and can't afford
an attorney, tough shit!

47:43.440 --> 47:45.176
Get in the car,
you suspected felon!

47:45.176 --> 47:46.577
What am I being charged with?

47:46.577 --> 47:48.977
That's for me to know
and you to find out.

48:02.426 --> 48:04.195
Who's she?

48:04.195 --> 48:06.664
Allow me to introduce
Dr. Natasha Lottelenya...

48:06.664 --> 48:09.433
of the Rosa Klebb
Institute, Leningrad.

48:09.433 --> 48:12.436
Hello. This lunatic
has kidnapped me.

48:12.436 --> 48:15.806
I'm afraid Dr. Lottelenya
doesn't speak any English...

48:15.806 --> 48:18.375
but I'll be happy
to translate.

48:18.375 --> 48:20.511
What is that?

48:20.511 --> 48:22.446
What is that thing?
What is she doing?

48:22.446 --> 48:25.449
Dr. Lottelenya is one of
the world's leading experts...

48:25.449 --> 48:28.852
on the prevention
and control of extreme pain.

48:28.852 --> 48:31.889
Interestingly enough,
she's also an authority...

48:31.889 --> 48:33.948
on the causation
of extreme pain.

48:45.469 --> 48:46.971
What are you saying?

48:46.971 --> 48:49.373
Is she going to do something?

48:49.373 --> 48:50.874
That depends on you...

48:50.874 --> 48:53.177
on how much
you're willing to tell us.

48:53.177 --> 48:55.980
Oh, God.
I can't tell you anything.

48:55.980 --> 48:59.483
Honest, honest.
I don't know anything.

48:59.483 --> 49:00.918
I understand...

49:00.918 --> 49:04.911
and believe me,
I respect that.

49:13.597 --> 49:16.033
What needles?

49:16.033 --> 49:17.935
This is state of the art.

49:17.935 --> 49:22.139
In the old days, we used
Zippo lighters and rats...

49:22.139 --> 49:23.941
but this...

49:23.941 --> 49:27.945
this is called Jane's Probe.

49:27.945 --> 49:33.417
Now, when introduced
past the left eyeball...

49:33.417 --> 49:36.954
you can insert it right into
the pain centre of the brain.

49:36.954 --> 49:38.888
Then a little electric current--

49:40.457 --> 49:42.459
God, what is that? Don't!

49:42.459 --> 49:43.949
It's not necessary!

49:54.238 --> 49:55.739
Who's that?

49:55.739 --> 49:58.075
That's Professor Lancaster.

49:58.075 --> 50:01.306
He was really a tough one
when he came in here.

50:02.980 --> 50:04.481
Now listen to him.

50:04.481 --> 50:07.780
If I say anything,
how do I know you'll let me go?

50:18.862 --> 50:20.796
You just have to trust us.

50:31.075 --> 50:33.243
Tell me who you report to.

50:33.243 --> 50:34.978
A woman.

50:34.978 --> 50:36.714
A very tall woman.
I only saw her once.

50:36.714 --> 50:38.716
Where do I find her?

50:38.716 --> 50:40.517
Honest to God,
I don't know.

50:40.517 --> 50:43.213
Dr. Lottelenya.

50:44.221 --> 50:47.524
Wait.
I don't know where she is...

50:47.524 --> 50:49.526
but I do know
her telephone number.

50:49.526 --> 50:52.893
There's a piece of paper
in my shirt pocket.

51:03.974 --> 51:07.678
Mr. Ferderber,
I would advise you to disappear.

51:07.678 --> 51:10.848
Vanish. Change your name,
your job...

51:10.848 --> 51:14.418
and if possible, your face.

51:14.418 --> 51:16.887
-Who's that?
-Open up in there!

51:16.887 --> 51:18.889
-Come on.
-Open up!

51:18.889 --> 51:22.620
-Come this way.
-My name...

51:25.262 --> 51:28.565
Where is my goddamn car?

51:28.565 --> 51:30.033
Hey, Ted.

51:30.033 --> 51:34.663
We were getting ready
to take the kid to the zoo.

51:35.672 --> 51:37.174
Look at him.

51:37.174 --> 51:40.177
"It is believed
that as recently as 1979...

51:40.177 --> 51:42.579
''eight subspecies of tigers
were living.

51:42.579 --> 51:44.081
''Today only five remain.''

51:44.081 --> 51:46.583
-Oh, no.
-How about that?

51:46.583 --> 51:48.085
Right. Isn't he gorgeous?

51:48.085 --> 51:50.587
There he is.
Don't worry, baby.

51:50.587 --> 51:52.756
Mommy and Daddy will save him.

51:52.756 --> 51:54.658
Yes, we will.
We'll see to it.

51:54.658 --> 51:57.889
There'll be lots of tigers
when you grow up.

51:59.329 --> 52:01.765
Let's check out the elephants.

52:01.765 --> 52:03.665
Here we go.

52:09.206 --> 52:11.572
This is like a parade.

52:13.410 --> 52:15.512
You have to talk to
our little friend.

52:15.512 --> 52:17.080
Which one?

52:17.080 --> 52:20.484
The big ''M.''
I'll take care of him.

52:20.484 --> 52:21.746
Do it fast. I'm hungry.

52:22.986 --> 52:26.490
If you're in a hurry,
why don't we create a diversion?

52:26.490 --> 52:28.492
Like what, for instance?

52:28.492 --> 52:30.894
Remember what worked in Toronto?

52:30.894 --> 52:32.496
No. Please. Not that.

52:32.496 --> 52:34.898
Help!
My wife is having a fit!

52:34.898 --> 52:36.500
Jeff, don't do this to me!

52:36.500 --> 52:39.369
-Help!
-l really hate you.

52:39.369 --> 52:43.874
Come on. Help!

52:43.874 --> 52:47.867
Oh, God! Don't let her
swallow her tongue!

52:51.515 --> 52:54.117
Police! Police!

52:54.117 --> 52:56.620
Stand back.
We trained for this.

52:56.620 --> 52:58.952
Somebody hold my popcorn.

53:05.829 --> 53:09.766
And they say,
ain't you glad you're single?

53:09.766 --> 53:10.968
Hey, honey,
there's the alligators.

53:10.968 --> 53:14.471
Look at that. Wow!

53:14.471 --> 53:17.998
Look at those alligators.

53:20.844 --> 53:22.641
See them?

53:25.749 --> 53:28.513
They look mean, don't they?

53:43.133 --> 53:45.302
Morty!
How's it going, champ?

53:45.302 --> 53:47.871
Blue! No!
It's an alligator pit!

53:47.871 --> 53:49.506
Get me out of here!

53:49.506 --> 53:52.009
Relax.
They've been fed already.

53:52.009 --> 53:53.911
Stay! Stay back!

53:53.911 --> 53:57.414
It says here that
these are American alligators.

53:57.414 --> 54:00.817
Know how you can tell?
This is fascinating.

54:00.817 --> 54:04.955
They have a broader snout and
you can't see the fourth tooth.

54:04.955 --> 54:07.457
Don't leave!
Get me out of here!

54:07.457 --> 54:09.793
Give me your wallet.

54:09.793 --> 54:11.128
What?

54:11.128 --> 54:13.530
You owe me $57.50
for a new stroller.

54:13.530 --> 54:15.966
Give me your wallet.

54:15.966 --> 54:20.871
OK. Sure.
Just one second.

54:20.871 --> 54:24.568
-Come on.
-I'm coming! All right?

54:25.576 --> 54:29.046
-OK. OK.
-Come on.

54:29.046 --> 54:30.247
Hey. Whoa.

54:30.247 --> 54:33.150
I paid you back.
There. Even Steven.

54:33.150 --> 54:35.485
Just a second.

54:35.485 --> 54:37.654
Hurry up! Please!

54:37.654 --> 54:41.858
Listen,
I don't have any change.

54:41.858 --> 54:43.460
Can I owe you $2.50?

54:43.460 --> 54:46.296
OK! Just get me
the fuck out of here!

54:46.296 --> 54:49.566
Watch your language.

54:49.566 --> 54:52.035
I need something
I can use for a rope.

54:52.035 --> 54:54.526
A rope?

54:55.906 --> 54:57.207
Give me your jacket.

54:57.207 --> 54:59.509
Good idea.

54:59.509 --> 55:02.412
You're OK, Blue. Really.

55:02.412 --> 55:03.914
You're an OK guy.

55:03.914 --> 55:06.450
Please, Morty. God.

55:06.450 --> 55:09.044
Come on, Blue. Let's go.
Hurry up! Chop chop!

55:10.053 --> 55:11.655
OK.

55:11.655 --> 55:14.257
No, no, no.
It's not long enough.

55:14.257 --> 55:16.960
Tell you what...

55:16.960 --> 55:19.129
give me your pants.

55:19.129 --> 55:20.687
My pants?

55:22.132 --> 55:24.600
No way. No.

55:26.770 --> 55:28.965
OK. OK. OK.

55:30.474 --> 55:31.941
OK!

55:33.744 --> 55:35.912
They sense fear.

55:35.912 --> 55:37.914
I know they do, Blue.
I can see that.

55:37.914 --> 55:41.752
I know what fear is.
You're driving me crazy.

55:41.752 --> 55:44.254
See the big monkey, honey?

55:44.254 --> 55:45.744
See the big monkey?

55:46.757 --> 55:49.326
I'm so sorry about everything.

55:49.326 --> 55:53.490
So sorry.
It just became like--

55:55.298 --> 55:57.095
Oh, my God.
It's eating my shoe.

55:59.002 --> 56:02.005
Stay back.
Give her some room.

56:02.005 --> 56:03.940
Put your hand in her mouth...

56:03.940 --> 56:06.738
or she'll swallow her tongue
like my cousin Albert!

56:08.478 --> 56:10.139
OK, Blue, here we go.

56:11.948 --> 56:13.643
Make the rope!

56:16.820 --> 56:18.021
OK.

56:18.021 --> 56:20.624
Here we go. Make the rope.

56:20.624 --> 56:22.926
Oh, no.
It's not going to work.

56:22.926 --> 56:26.463
It's just not long enough.
I'll go for help.

56:26.463 --> 56:29.499
Blue, please, no.
Don't leave me.

56:29.499 --> 56:31.501
Please don't leave me!

56:31.501 --> 56:33.670
Can I get you anything?
Coffee?

56:33.670 --> 56:36.173
I'm fine. No coffee.

56:36.173 --> 56:39.676
Just hurry up, please!
Bye! Thank you!

56:39.676 --> 56:41.178
-Ta-ta.
-Ta-ta!

56:41.178 --> 56:42.702
Come on, honey.

56:43.814 --> 56:46.983
Mary, look at the cypress.

56:46.983 --> 56:50.887
Hi, girls.
Afternoon, Sister.

56:50.887 --> 56:52.889
-Good afternoon.
-Don't miss the gators.

56:52.889 --> 56:56.256
Thank you. We're going
to see the gators, girls.

56:57.327 --> 57:00.764
Stand back, everybody.
I've got her medication.

57:00.764 --> 57:04.267
Here it is, darling.
It was in the car.

57:04.267 --> 57:07.270
Under the tongue.
Are you all right?

57:07.270 --> 57:09.773
Thank God.

57:09.773 --> 57:11.274
Thank you, Lieutenant.

57:11.274 --> 57:14.711
I want to thank everybody.
You've been great.

57:14.711 --> 57:19.148
-Thank you.
-Sweetheart, can you walk?

57:20.784 --> 57:22.786
I thought your performance
was excellent.

57:22.786 --> 57:25.222
Let's not do that anymore.

57:25.222 --> 57:28.291
Why not? It always works.

57:28.291 --> 57:30.293
I have to wash my hair again.

57:30.293 --> 57:33.797
Honey, it's that windblown look.
It so becomes you.

57:33.797 --> 57:35.799
Thank you so much.

57:35.799 --> 57:38.535
Come here, sweetheart.

57:38.535 --> 57:41.138
Want to have
some real fun tonight?

57:41.138 --> 57:42.639
Like last night?

57:42.639 --> 57:45.142
Only better.
A real fantasy.

57:45.142 --> 57:47.508
What'd you have in mind?

57:57.754 --> 57:59.779
I know you.

58:01.124 --> 58:04.560
Everybody know me.
I am Muerte.

58:06.363 --> 58:11.528
You're the guy got stomped
by that feller with the baby.

58:12.769 --> 58:15.237
Don't provoke me, OK?

58:19.476 --> 58:21.778
You want to get back at him?

58:21.778 --> 58:22.979
What?

58:22.979 --> 58:24.781
I know somebody who'd pay big.

58:24.781 --> 58:26.550
You don't know nada.

58:26.550 --> 58:30.281
OK. I don't know nada.

58:31.621 --> 58:37.059
But this guy said Muerte's
the guy for the job.

58:40.263 --> 58:42.299
Who said that?

58:42.299 --> 58:44.324
About Muerte.

58:47.270 --> 58:50.807
You got to buy me a drink first.

58:50.807 --> 58:52.968
What would you like?

59:17.434 --> 59:20.337
I don't believe men.

59:20.337 --> 59:25.242
Three guys tried
to pick me up tonight.

59:25.242 --> 59:27.277
I can understand that.

59:27.277 --> 59:29.279
-You can?
-Yeah.

59:29.279 --> 59:31.770
My mother was right about you.

59:33.283 --> 59:37.287
-Did she wake up?
-Just once around midnight.

59:37.287 --> 59:39.289
Just wanted to be held.

59:39.289 --> 59:41.791
How did it go?
Did Morty go for it?

59:41.791 --> 59:43.793
Of course he went for it.

59:43.793 --> 59:46.284
God, I am so tired.

59:49.299 --> 59:51.401
Keep the makeup on.

59:51.401 --> 59:55.805
-Why?
-It's kind of a turn-on.

59:55.805 --> 59:59.866
Yecch! You disgust me.

01:00:02.145 --> 01:00:04.347
Hello?

01:00:04.347 --> 01:00:06.182
Your name is what?

01:00:06.182 --> 01:00:09.152
What? Death?

01:00:09.152 --> 01:00:10.813
Yeah, I see.

01:00:12.255 --> 01:00:13.745
It's about Blue.

01:00:16.259 --> 01:00:18.659
It's the opening gambit.

01:00:22.132 --> 01:00:25.402
No, no, no.
You can't find us.

01:00:25.402 --> 01:00:29.566
We'll send a man to pick you up
at Bayou St. John.

01:00:49.159 --> 01:00:52.862
Come along.
We are wasting time.

01:00:52.862 --> 01:00:55.298
Oh, my God.
It was horrible.

01:00:55.298 --> 01:00:56.733
It was a nightmare.

01:00:56.733 --> 01:00:59.235
Why'd you have
to make it so bumpy?

01:00:59.235 --> 01:01:00.737
Would you prefer to walk?

01:01:00.737 --> 01:01:04.240
I'm all nauseous.
I'm white as a sheet.

01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:07.577
It was a nightmare.
I'm a land creature.

01:01:07.577 --> 01:01:10.246
After you, sir.
Frau Novacek is waiting.

01:01:10.246 --> 01:01:13.116
I'm driving back, OK?

01:01:13.116 --> 01:01:17.087
It's very good of you
to pay us a visit.

01:01:17.087 --> 01:01:18.588
I am Paulina Novacek.

01:01:18.588 --> 01:01:20.557
Your name?

01:01:20.557 --> 01:01:24.027
My name is Muerte.

01:01:24.027 --> 01:01:27.097
As in Death?

01:01:27.097 --> 01:01:29.998
Yes. You speak Spanish?

01:01:32.902 --> 01:01:35.038
I trust you.

01:01:35.038 --> 01:01:38.341
Good.
Perhaps I'll trust you.

01:01:38.341 --> 01:01:39.535
Come.

01:01:43.513 --> 01:01:46.277
Excuse me. Paulina?

01:01:59.195 --> 01:02:00.719
Thank you so much.

01:02:05.835 --> 01:02:07.337
Hi, guys.

01:02:07.337 --> 01:02:09.239
You can go to a strip joint.

01:02:09.239 --> 01:02:11.741
We're spending
a quiet evening at home.

01:02:11.741 --> 01:02:13.743
Thanks. We appreciate that.

01:02:13.743 --> 01:02:16.246
Anything we can do
to make your lives easier.

01:02:16.246 --> 01:02:18.748
Isn't the baby
a little young for dolls?

01:02:18.748 --> 01:02:21.751
It's for me.
It's a post-feminist doll.

01:02:21.751 --> 01:02:24.554
Goes to work with little
sneakers on, but resents it.

01:02:24.554 --> 01:02:27.757
-Night.
-Bye.

01:02:27.757 --> 01:02:32.262
They're really
very interesting people.

01:02:32.262 --> 01:02:34.389
Come on.

01:02:36.132 --> 01:02:38.635
I no working with him!

01:02:38.635 --> 01:02:40.770
I no working with him,
you bitch!

01:02:40.770 --> 01:02:44.040
No, no!
Please! Paulina!

01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:47.243
You expect me to believe
some bum approached you...

01:02:47.243 --> 01:02:51.881
with information that Mr. Blue
is coming here tonight?

01:02:51.881 --> 01:02:53.983
He's coming here tonight!

01:02:53.983 --> 01:02:55.485
What if he's telling the truth?

01:02:55.485 --> 01:02:57.487
Thank you very much.
What is your name?

01:02:57.487 --> 01:02:59.456
So, Mr. Muerte--

01:02:59.456 --> 01:03:02.992
Excuse me, please.
No mister. It's Muerte.

01:03:02.992 --> 01:03:05.728
You come here pretending
to sell information.

01:03:05.728 --> 01:03:11.462
You are so obviously
a confederate of Mr. Blue.

01:03:19.375 --> 01:03:20.740
My family.

01:03:22.445 --> 01:03:24.572
Do me a favor.

01:03:25.748 --> 01:03:27.841
Be careful tonight,
all right?

01:03:35.358 --> 01:03:37.360
-Jeff.
-Yeah?

01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:40.864
I really mean that.
I got a funny feeling.

01:03:40.864 --> 01:03:42.365
Maybe it's your allergies.

01:03:42.365 --> 01:03:44.367
It is not my allergies.

01:03:44.367 --> 01:03:47.370
Promise me you'll be
extra careful tonight.

01:03:47.370 --> 01:03:48.667
I will.

01:03:50.807 --> 01:03:53.877
I love you very much.

01:03:53.877 --> 01:03:56.446
You really do?

01:03:56.446 --> 01:03:59.382
More and more and more
every day.

01:03:59.382 --> 01:04:01.384
You know what's funny?

01:04:01.384 --> 01:04:02.817
What?

01:04:06.356 --> 01:04:09.621
That's exactly how I feel.

01:04:34.751 --> 01:04:36.343
I'm starving.

01:04:39.589 --> 01:04:42.456
-Hold down the fort.
-Yes, sir.

01:04:46.863 --> 01:04:49.866
He don't listen to me.
I try telling him.

01:04:49.866 --> 01:04:51.367
See what I'm saying?

01:04:51.367 --> 01:04:54.270
Pay no attention
to what I'm saying.

01:04:54.270 --> 01:04:55.939
Taxi!

01:04:55.939 --> 01:04:58.931
Shit! Damn!

01:05:08.318 --> 01:05:09.785
Damn!

01:05:13.690 --> 01:05:15.391
Police! Follow that cab!

01:05:15.391 --> 01:05:19.229
I haven't heard anybody
say that in a long time.

01:05:19.229 --> 01:05:24.531
-Come on! Just drive!
-Hold your horses.

01:05:27.237 --> 01:05:28.568
Yes.

01:05:31.174 --> 01:05:33.243
Yes, yes, yes.

01:05:33.243 --> 01:05:36.212
Frank, I think
I'm getting the hang of this.

01:05:36.212 --> 01:05:39.249
It's just like
the old plastique bomb...

01:05:39.249 --> 01:05:41.308
only a zillion times
more powerful.

01:05:45.888 --> 01:05:48.758
We will do our best, Frank.

01:05:48.758 --> 01:05:51.661
Oh, my God. She walked!

01:05:51.661 --> 01:05:54.264
Louise just walked.
I got to go.

01:05:54.264 --> 01:05:56.699
Do you see what you just did?

01:05:56.699 --> 01:05:58.201
You wonderful thing, you.

01:05:58.201 --> 01:05:59.769
Wait a minute.
Now don't move.

01:05:59.769 --> 01:06:01.304
Hold it. Oops!

01:06:01.304 --> 01:06:03.473
Come here.

01:06:03.473 --> 01:06:06.476
Do it again for Daddy.

01:06:06.476 --> 01:06:08.478
Great!

01:06:08.478 --> 01:06:09.979
You are amazing!

01:06:09.979 --> 01:06:11.748
Come on.

01:06:11.748 --> 01:06:13.249
Come on, honey.

01:06:13.249 --> 01:06:14.617
Come over to Mom--

01:06:14.617 --> 01:06:16.486
Come to Mommy.

01:06:16.486 --> 01:06:19.489
Honey, you can make it.

01:06:19.489 --> 01:06:20.990
Oh, baby!

01:06:20.990 --> 01:06:24.727
I can't believe you.
You are amazing.

01:06:24.727 --> 01:06:27.630
Come on now.
Isn't Daddy--Oh, honey.

01:06:27.630 --> 01:06:30.466
Can you come to Mommy?

01:06:30.466 --> 01:06:33.102
Daddy's going to be
so surprised.

01:06:33.102 --> 01:06:36.435
I am so proud of you.
You are just terrific.

01:06:40.209 --> 01:06:42.512
-Hi there.
-Hi.

01:06:42.512 --> 01:06:45.248
-Stop here.
-l can't stop on no bridge.

01:06:45.248 --> 01:06:48.751
-l don't want no ticket.
-I'm a cop.

01:06:48.751 --> 01:06:51.754
You'll give me a ticket.
Entrapment.

01:06:51.754 --> 01:06:55.622
Goddamn it! Stop here!
Not going to entrap you.

01:06:59.962 --> 01:07:02.598
I need you to wait here.

01:07:02.598 --> 01:07:05.101
I can't wait
outside the city limits.

01:07:05.101 --> 01:07:08.638
-That's the law.
-Just wait here!

01:07:08.638 --> 01:07:10.572
I don't think so.

01:07:11.741 --> 01:07:13.174
Damn it!

01:07:16.713 --> 01:07:18.348
You going to cast off for me?

01:07:18.348 --> 01:07:20.616
-Sure will.
-All right.

01:07:20.616 --> 01:07:23.119
How long do you think
it'll take me?

01:07:23.119 --> 01:07:25.144
You'll be there by dawn.

01:07:27.156 --> 01:07:29.359
-Got it?
-Got it.

01:07:29.359 --> 01:07:30.690
Thanks.

01:08:06.763 --> 01:08:09.766
You lost your parade.

01:08:09.766 --> 01:08:12.769
Have a seat. Come on.

01:08:12.769 --> 01:08:14.293
Play something else.

01:08:39.328 --> 01:08:42.319
Honey. It's OK.

01:09:00.183 --> 01:09:03.453
This her?
This pretty little thing?

01:09:03.453 --> 01:09:05.955
She's more dangerous
than she looks...

01:09:05.955 --> 01:09:07.957
but you can handle her.

01:09:07.957 --> 01:09:10.960
She don't look dangerous
at all to me.

01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:14.087
Come on, sugar. Come to Papa.

01:09:15.832 --> 01:09:18.600
Careful, Sikes.
I don't want her hurt.

01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:22.337
Sure thing. She'll be
lots more fun later on...

01:09:22.337 --> 01:09:24.774
if she ain't all banged up.

01:09:24.774 --> 01:09:26.776
Ain't you the clever one?

01:09:26.776 --> 01:09:28.743
You bet I'm clever.

01:09:28.743 --> 01:09:32.544
Wait till you see what
I got for you.

01:09:36.786 --> 01:09:39.354
So far,
I'm not very impressed.

01:09:39.354 --> 01:09:42.153
I'm going to get you.

01:09:45.027 --> 01:09:46.255
Gotcha!

01:09:47.330 --> 01:09:49.161
Damn!

01:09:56.639 --> 01:09:59.164
Sikes...

01:10:01.177 --> 01:10:03.168
Put it away.

01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:14.357
It's a taser.

01:10:14.357 --> 01:10:17.258
You're not going to give me
any more trouble, are you?

01:10:42.785 --> 01:10:44.787
Having fun?

01:10:44.787 --> 01:10:47.790
What in the hell
are you doing here?

01:10:47.790 --> 01:10:50.793
I'm not here.
I'm at home, like you.

01:10:50.793 --> 01:10:53.796
Ted, you're in way over
your head.

01:10:53.796 --> 01:10:55.298
Just wait on the boat.

01:10:55.298 --> 01:10:58.734
Not a chance.
And call me Lieutenant.

01:10:58.734 --> 01:11:00.770
Lieutenant, believe me--

01:11:00.770 --> 01:11:02.872
-No.
-Why not?

01:11:02.872 --> 01:11:06.638
My orders are not to let you
out of my sight.

01:11:07.977 --> 01:11:11.504
OK. Just stay close.

01:11:14.150 --> 01:11:17.687
Whatever happens,
do exactly what I say...

01:11:17.687 --> 01:11:19.755
no matter
how nuts it may sound.

01:11:19.755 --> 01:11:21.347
Absolutely.

01:11:22.558 --> 01:11:23.759
Where's your gun?

01:11:23.759 --> 01:11:28.253
I don't carry a gun.
Pay attention.

01:11:30.232 --> 01:11:34.396
Careful.
Things could get very sticky.

01:11:37.373 --> 01:11:39.675
Good morning, Mr. Blue.

01:11:39.675 --> 01:11:42.378
This is amazing.

01:11:42.378 --> 01:11:45.681
I was just saying
things could get very sticky.

01:11:45.681 --> 01:11:49.785
It's good to see you again.

01:11:49.785 --> 01:11:52.488
You haven't changed. Have l?

01:11:52.488 --> 01:11:53.990
Only your men.

01:11:53.990 --> 01:11:58.728
Thank you.
It's these American accessories.

01:11:58.728 --> 01:12:01.964
They're very good.

01:12:01.964 --> 01:12:05.627
Come. We must have some tea.

01:12:07.737 --> 01:12:11.741
You are still having
such a wonderful body, Mr. Blue.

01:12:11.741 --> 01:12:13.075
Well, thank you.

01:12:13.075 --> 01:12:14.744
What do you think
of the lieutenant?

01:12:14.744 --> 01:12:16.412
Will you shut up?

01:12:16.412 --> 01:12:20.750
You're so...
How you say the word? Foxy.

01:12:20.750 --> 01:12:21.951
Shall we?

01:12:21.951 --> 01:12:24.987
Also you're
a very valuable commodity.

01:12:24.987 --> 01:12:27.223
Think what the Libyans
would pay...

01:12:27.223 --> 01:12:29.592
for your knowledge
of American intelligence.

01:12:29.592 --> 01:12:32.261
Or the Chinese.
Or the Colombians.

01:12:32.261 --> 01:12:34.764
I think quite
a lot of money, Mr. Blue.

01:12:34.764 --> 01:12:37.756
See?
Most people do like me.

01:12:46.642 --> 01:12:48.132
Surprise.

01:12:49.311 --> 01:12:51.714
I'm sorry, Jeff.

01:12:51.714 --> 01:12:54.684
This is between you and me.

01:12:54.684 --> 01:12:56.585
To involve Jane or my child--

01:12:56.585 --> 01:13:00.589
I know. It was in
the worst possible taste.

01:13:00.589 --> 01:13:03.893
You see,
in just half an hour...

01:13:03.893 --> 01:13:06.228
a helicopter and
Comrade Zubic will arrive...

01:13:06.228 --> 01:13:10.232
to transfer the C-22
to a cargo vessel.

01:13:10.232 --> 01:13:12.835
You and I will travel with it.

01:13:12.835 --> 01:13:14.837
What's C-22?

01:13:14.837 --> 01:13:17.940
I was meaning
to tell you about that.

01:13:17.940 --> 01:13:19.703
Bring him in.

01:13:23.579 --> 01:13:27.950
So...you see, Mr. Blue?

01:13:27.950 --> 01:13:32.254
I have captured
all your confederates.

01:13:32.254 --> 01:13:34.724
Paulina, Paulina, Paulina...

01:13:34.724 --> 01:13:36.659
my hat's off to you.

01:13:36.659 --> 01:13:38.461
Why not your pants?

01:13:38.461 --> 01:13:40.396
I could figure you getting me.

01:13:40.396 --> 01:13:42.932
I could figure
you grabbing Jane.

01:13:42.932 --> 01:13:46.368
But to get your hands on
the boss man himself...

01:13:46.368 --> 01:13:47.892
the big ''M''.

01:13:49.138 --> 01:13:51.774
You're saying this man
is your superior?

01:13:51.774 --> 01:13:54.777
I said to him,
''Sir, the risk is too great.

01:13:54.777 --> 01:13:56.712
''You stay here
in the Hollow Mountain...

01:13:56.712 --> 01:13:58.714
''where it's safe,
and I shall go forth--''

01:13:58.714 --> 01:14:00.216
Take his gag off.

01:14:00.216 --> 01:14:03.786
No! No! No!
My name is Morty.

01:14:03.786 --> 01:14:05.054
Muerte.

01:14:05.054 --> 01:14:07.656
I kill you.

01:14:07.656 --> 01:14:09.458
Shut up!

01:14:09.458 --> 01:14:12.995
Someone find out who this man is
and then kill him.

01:14:12.995 --> 01:14:14.997
I've got no time for this.

01:14:14.997 --> 01:14:17.466
Mrs. Blue,
passing your child over.

01:14:17.466 --> 01:14:19.058
No! Don't do it!

01:14:21.337 --> 01:14:24.406
How heroic.

01:14:24.406 --> 01:14:30.279
Mrs. Blue, you are of
absolutely no value to me...

01:14:30.279 --> 01:14:33.282
except as an example
to your husband.

01:14:33.282 --> 01:14:37.082
Jane, you know what to do.

01:16:02.538 --> 01:16:05.007
Would you please hold still?

01:16:05.007 --> 01:16:06.208
Those are police cuffs.

01:16:06.208 --> 01:16:08.711
You can't get them off
with a bobby pin.

01:16:08.711 --> 01:16:10.946
-Absolutely right.
-Thanks, hon.

01:16:10.946 --> 01:16:13.949
-Want me to work on yours?
-Yeah, please.

01:16:13.949 --> 01:16:15.451
Guess who walked today.

01:16:15.451 --> 01:16:17.453
You're kidding?
And I missed it?

01:16:17.453 --> 01:16:19.455
I'm really mad at you, too.

01:16:19.455 --> 01:16:22.424
Whose idea was it to take
this job anyway?

01:16:22.424 --> 01:16:25.828
We got to get out of here.
Follow me!

01:16:25.828 --> 01:16:27.029
''Follow me''?

01:16:27.029 --> 01:16:28.464
Give him his moment in the sun.

01:16:28.464 --> 01:16:30.489
What sun?

01:16:48.350 --> 01:16:51.620
Son of a bitch! Damn it!

01:16:51.620 --> 01:16:52.855
How badly are you hit?

01:16:52.855 --> 01:16:55.024
I'm not hit.
I just smashed my knee.

01:16:55.024 --> 01:16:57.720
This is why I hate
working with amateurs.

01:17:10.239 --> 01:17:11.740
Where the hell are you from?

01:17:11.740 --> 01:17:13.742
North Adams, Massachusetts.
Why?

01:17:13.742 --> 01:17:15.232
Just asking.

01:17:19.648 --> 01:17:20.876
Damn!

01:17:38.567 --> 01:17:40.057
Where is it?

01:17:46.608 --> 01:17:49.111
-You wait here!
-No way.

01:17:49.111 --> 01:17:52.614
Jane's an expert in martial arts
I can't pronounce.

01:17:52.614 --> 01:17:55.617
She can kill you three ways
without using her hands.

01:17:55.617 --> 01:17:57.050
Do what she says.

01:17:59.755 --> 01:18:01.780
Maybe I'll wait here.

01:18:39.294 --> 01:18:40.659
Czech-mate.

01:18:44.967 --> 01:18:47.469
Daylight.

01:18:47.469 --> 01:18:50.404
Zubic! Zubic!

01:19:01.417 --> 01:19:03.419
Bring it over, you idiot.

01:19:03.419 --> 01:19:05.546
I am surrounded by fools.

01:19:06.555 --> 01:19:09.758
Climb up, Paulina! Climb up!

01:19:09.758 --> 01:19:13.888
I can't!
This case is too heavy!

01:19:18.801 --> 01:19:20.826
Improvise!

01:19:26.375 --> 01:19:28.935
Down! We must go down!

01:19:37.352 --> 01:19:40.956
Easy. Don't...let me fall.

01:19:40.956 --> 01:19:43.025
Zubic, get this thing up!

01:19:43.025 --> 01:19:44.526
This is good!

01:19:44.526 --> 01:19:47.029
Remember!
Make it look real!

01:19:47.029 --> 01:19:48.394
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:20:02.344 --> 01:20:05.211
Hey! Remember Helsinki!

01:20:12.154 --> 01:20:14.281
Gotcha, lady!

01:20:15.524 --> 01:20:17.059
Good wrist lock, hon.

01:20:17.059 --> 01:20:18.993
Thank you.

01:20:20.696 --> 01:20:22.027
Come here!

01:20:23.565 --> 01:20:25.601
Come on!

01:20:25.601 --> 01:20:28.092
Be careful where you shoot.

01:20:32.374 --> 01:20:34.409
Mr. Blue.

01:20:34.409 --> 01:20:37.742
Have you come to watch
your wife die?

01:20:39.414 --> 01:20:42.651
No! Don't do that!
You'll kill us all!

01:20:42.651 --> 01:20:44.419
If Jane goes, we all go.

01:20:44.419 --> 01:20:47.756
Just a minute.
Think about it.

01:20:47.756 --> 01:20:49.758
Don't be such a jerk, Jeff.

01:20:49.758 --> 01:20:54.062
This is your chance.
Let her go and you can have...

01:20:54.062 --> 01:20:56.465
You can have everything.

01:20:56.465 --> 01:20:59.468
I'm getting seriously pissed.

01:20:59.468 --> 01:21:01.203
No!

01:21:01.203 --> 01:21:03.296
So am l!

01:21:07.910 --> 01:21:11.903
We're naming the kid
Jane Louise. Period.

01:21:13.515 --> 01:21:14.743
OK.

01:21:17.452 --> 01:21:18.954
Dropping your weapons...

01:21:18.954 --> 01:21:21.456
or you'll be
shooted from the air!

01:21:21.456 --> 01:21:23.892
Zubic! Zubic!

01:21:23.892 --> 01:21:26.828
Face down in the mud,
everybody.

01:21:26.828 --> 01:21:29.331
Hurry, Paulina!
You're not safe!

01:21:29.331 --> 01:21:33.235
-I'm coming!
-We've got to get you out!

01:21:33.235 --> 01:21:36.238
Hurry, Paulina!
We've got to get you out!

01:21:36.238 --> 01:21:40.175
You are not safe! Get in!

01:21:40.175 --> 01:21:42.234
Thank you. Thank you.

01:21:45.314 --> 01:21:47.942
We did it!

01:21:49.818 --> 01:21:54.022
I had begun to think
you had forgotten me.

01:21:54.022 --> 01:21:57.092
Oh, Paulina.
We have never forgotten.

01:21:57.092 --> 01:21:58.559
Oh, Zubic.

01:21:59.661 --> 01:22:01.263
What?

01:22:01.263 --> 01:22:04.994
And thank you for flying
Air Czechoslovakia.

01:22:07.369 --> 01:22:09.805
Like I said, no one
ever looks at the driver.

01:22:09.805 --> 01:22:12.441
You going to tell me
the rest of the story?

01:22:12.441 --> 01:22:15.444
-Sure. Where was l?
-Czech police.

01:22:15.444 --> 01:22:17.746
The Czechs had permission
to come in...

01:22:17.746 --> 01:22:19.548
but they couldn't
just snatch Novacek.

01:22:19.548 --> 01:22:22.384
We had to create a situation
where she'd leave willingly.

01:22:22.384 --> 01:22:23.919
You saw her
get in the chopper.

01:22:23.919 --> 01:22:26.288
She went of
her own free will.

01:22:26.288 --> 01:22:27.789
No kidnapping, no coercion.

01:22:27.789 --> 01:22:29.791
You going to wake him up?

01:22:29.791 --> 01:22:31.226
What for?

01:22:31.226 --> 01:22:33.456
-Janie!
-There's our baby!

01:22:34.863 --> 01:22:37.032
Hi, honey.

01:22:37.032 --> 01:22:38.226
Hi, sweetie.

01:22:42.804 --> 01:22:44.406
Thank you so much.

01:22:44.406 --> 01:22:47.542
What have you two lovebirds
been up to all night?

01:22:47.542 --> 01:22:51.046
There's a new mud wrestling
place on Bourbon Street.

01:22:51.046 --> 01:22:53.037
Food's not bad, either.

01:22:54.483 --> 01:22:56.718
You guys have so much fun.

01:22:56.718 --> 01:22:58.987
We have a lot of fun, too.

01:22:58.987 --> 01:23:01.123
-l could tell.
-Thank you again.

01:23:01.123 --> 01:23:04.893
-I'm so jealous.
-See you later.

01:23:04.893 --> 01:23:08.063
Yeah. You can go home
and clean up, Lieutenant.

01:23:08.063 --> 01:23:11.066
-What?
-It's over. Finished.

01:23:11.066 --> 01:23:15.237
No plans to invade Cuba while
you're in the neighbourhood?

01:23:15.237 --> 01:23:17.739
No. We're shipping out today.

01:23:17.739 --> 01:23:20.299
I have your word on that?

01:23:45.100 --> 01:23:46.761
Please, please, please.

01:24:01.550 --> 01:24:03.984
Sleeping like a baby.

01:24:12.294 --> 01:24:14.663
Hi, Morty.

01:24:14.663 --> 01:24:16.398
Morty?

01:24:16.398 --> 01:24:21.461
OK. No more Mr. Nice Guy.

01:24:26.675 --> 01:24:31.246
Blue, help me! I can't swim!

01:24:31.246 --> 01:24:33.815
What do you think?

01:24:33.815 --> 01:24:35.817
I'm going down!
I can't swim! Please!

01:24:35.817 --> 01:24:38.353
Mr. and Mrs. Blue!
S.O.S.! Help!

01:24:38.353 --> 01:24:39.888
Yeah.

01:24:39.888 --> 01:24:42.958
My God! Oh, Jesus!
The ocean is so deep!

01:24:42.958 --> 01:24:45.188
Catch!

01:24:47.596 --> 01:24:49.097
Oh, my God!

01:24:49.097 --> 01:24:52.601
Oh, God!
Thank you, Mrs. Blue!

01:24:52.601 --> 01:24:55.804
You are a great woman!
The woman of the Nineties!

01:24:55.804 --> 01:24:59.274
Mrs. Blue, throw me
a piece of rope, please!

01:24:59.274 --> 01:25:02.544
I tell you what. Wait here.
We'll go for help.

01:25:02.544 --> 01:25:04.880
No, no, no!
Don't leave me!

01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:06.782
Anything you want?
Coffee, tea?

01:25:06.782 --> 01:25:09.684
Coffee, tea? No, I'm fine.
Thank you very much.

01:25:09.684 --> 01:25:11.653
Just get me the hell
out of here, please!

01:25:11.653 --> 01:25:13.388
-Morty.
-What?

01:25:13.388 --> 01:25:14.582
Ta-ta.

01:25:15.724 --> 01:25:16.918
Ta-ta.

01:25:20.028 --> 01:25:22.230
Now...

01:25:22.230 --> 01:25:23.891
which way is Cuba?

01:25:29.571 --> 01:25:33.575
No! That's the wrong way!
Please! Come back!

01:25:33.575 --> 01:25:35.844
No! The land
is back there behind you!

01:25:35.844 --> 01:25:38.836
Where you going? Blue, no!
