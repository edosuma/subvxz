00:01.001 --> 00:04.838
You know the human vagina
can lift over 200 pounds?

00:06.006 --> 00:08.425
No, uh... no, it is 20 pounds.

00:08.509 --> 00:11.845
I don't know, I-I saw, like,
a YouTube thing about it.

00:11.929 --> 00:15.057
Oh. I think I got too high to do this.

00:15.140 --> 00:16.433
- Don't say that. Are you joking?

00:16.517 --> 00:17.684
- N... Okay.
- That's so irresponsible.

00:17.768 --> 00:19.186
- It's fine. I can do it. I can do it.

00:19.269 --> 00:20.979
I can do it.
I just, like, got freaked out,

00:21.063 --> 00:23.065
'cause I felt like I was gonna perform,
like, a real surgery,

00:23.148 --> 00:25.359
so I thought I would just get,
like, a little toasted

00:25.442 --> 00:27.236
and it would give me confidence
and I would just do it,

00:27.319 --> 00:28.946
and I figured, you know,
we're gonna write after this anyway.

00:29.029 --> 00:31.532
- Well, yeah, we're not gonna write,
like, right after this.

00:31.615 --> 00:33.242
- We're not?

00:33.325 --> 00:35.536
- Yeah, we're writing a show
about female friendship, right?

00:35.619 --> 00:37.538
- Yeah.
- Yeah, so don't you think

00:37.621 --> 00:39.039
we should, like,
actually become friends first?

00:39.122 --> 00:41.416
- What do you call this?

00:41.500 --> 00:43.919
- Okay, yes, you installing
my new vagina would be, like,

00:44.002 --> 00:45.379
an amazing beginning to an episode,

00:45.462 --> 00:47.256
but all I'm saying is,
so far, all we've done is, like,

00:47.339 --> 00:49.508
sit in your apartment and talk about Dan.

00:49.591 --> 00:52.219
I just feel like it's kind of a no-brainer
that, like, we should

00:52.302 --> 00:54.179
go on some adventures together
before we start writing.

00:54.263 --> 00:57.182
- Come on, man. Can't we just...
- So I was thinking, after this,

00:57.266 --> 00:59.434
we pack our bags,
we hit the road for a few days

00:59.518 --> 01:01.854
and camp under the stars,
we have some laughs.

01:01.937 --> 01:03.605
- I don't know, like... what, today?

01:03.689 --> 01:05.357
- Why not?

01:05.440 --> 01:07.234
- I'm busy. I've got stuff to do.

01:07.317 --> 01:10.028
- Ugh. You have Dan's podcast,
Dan's weekly podcast

01:10.112 --> 01:12.114
you go to every week.
- Come on, man, just...

01:12.197 --> 01:13.991
- I'm just saying I'm sorry,
I feel like you would have

01:14.074 --> 01:15.868
a lot more power
in your relationship if you actually

01:15.951 --> 01:17.995
had your own things going on
every once in a while.

01:18.078 --> 01:19.913
- Barbara, I understand that
you represent a part of me

01:19.997 --> 01:23.041
that feels the need to question
my very happy relationship with Dan,

01:23.125 --> 01:24.751
but that doesn't mean that you're right.

01:24.835 --> 01:26.545
I don't need to play games

01:26.628 --> 01:29.089
and, like, you know,
make myself unavailable

01:29.173 --> 01:31.216
to, like, prove myself to him.
- Mm.

01:31.300 --> 01:33.385
- We're past that.
We poop with the door open sometimes.

01:33.468 --> 01:35.095
- Yeah, right there, right there.

01:35.179 --> 01:36.388
- Like, we tell each other everything.
- Mm-hmm.

01:36.471 --> 01:37.890
- Except for the fact that I, like,

01:37.973 --> 01:39.641
formed this unhealthy
codependent relationship

01:39.725 --> 01:41.268
with his former sex doll.

01:41.351 --> 01:42.769
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm, like, currently giving her

01:42.853 --> 01:44.021
a vaginal rejuvenation,

01:44.104 --> 01:45.856
'cause she can talk me
into anything and...

01:45.939 --> 01:47.941
Goddamn it! Is this thing in yet?

01:48.025 --> 01:49.401
- Yeah. It is.

01:50.444 --> 01:51.528
- What?

01:51.612 --> 01:53.030
- It has been for a while.

01:53.113 --> 01:54.364
- Like, you can feel this?

01:54.448 --> 01:56.074
- Oh, yeah.

01:56.158 --> 01:57.242
- Oh, you are such an asshole!

01:57.326 --> 01:59.703
- Oh, Codes, a girls' trip, you and me.

01:59.786 --> 02:01.205
Oh! It'll be so fun.

02:01.288 --> 02:03.957
We'll show Dan what an independent
codependent woman you are.

02:04.041 --> 02:06.043
We'll let go of the things
that no longer serve us.

02:06.126 --> 02:09.004
Wait! I want to hold on to that.

02:15.010 --> 02:16.845
Road trip...!

02:16.929 --> 02:19.389
- I can't believe
I let you talk me into this.

02:19.473 --> 02:21.475
That looks ridiculous, by the way.
- What?

02:21.558 --> 02:23.602
- The dirty vagina
you made me tie around your neck.

02:23.685 --> 02:25.687
Fuckin' Ed Gein-lookin' motherfucker.

02:25.771 --> 02:27.356
- Whatever. It's so cute.
You're just jelly.

02:27.439 --> 02:29.441
- Nah. You look insane.
- As insane as the patriarchy

02:29.525 --> 02:31.026
upon which I'm, like, commenting?

02:31.109 --> 02:32.569
No, I didn't think so.

02:33.695 --> 02:35.572
Codes, ever since I got this new vagina,

02:35.656 --> 02:37.991
I honestly, like, I feel like a new woman.

02:38.075 --> 02:40.035
Like, my own woman.

02:40.118 --> 02:42.120
- That's great, Barbara.
- You should try it sometime.

02:42.204 --> 02:44.414
- What, removing my vagina
and getting a new one?

02:45.165 --> 02:46.250
- No.

02:46.333 --> 02:48.252
Not letting every single moment
of your life be consumed

02:48.335 --> 02:50.045
by your boyfriend.
- What? It's not.

02:50.128 --> 02:51.547
- Then why do you keep looking
at your phone?

02:51.630 --> 02:53.590
- No, that... I just...
I wanted to make sure

02:53.674 --> 02:55.300
he got my text earlier, like,

02:55.384 --> 02:57.094
'cause he dot-dot-dotted,
but then the bubble disappeared,

02:57.177 --> 02:58.428
and I just felt like...

02:58.512 --> 03:00.389
- Cody! Do you fucking hear yourself?

03:00.472 --> 03:02.558
All you ever do is talk about Dan.

03:02.641 --> 03:04.810
Dan, Dan, Dan this, Dan that,
I'm obsessed with Dan,

03:04.893 --> 03:06.979
I love Dan's dick,
even when it smells like curry.

03:07.062 --> 03:08.856
- I don't feel like I've said that before.

03:08.939 --> 03:10.440
- How are we gonna write
a feminist masterpiece

03:10.524 --> 03:12.234
if we can't even pass the Bechdel test?

03:13.735 --> 03:16.280
Oh, shit. You do know
what the Bechdel test is, right?

03:16.363 --> 03:19.241
- Yeah, Barbara, yes, I know
what the Bechdel test is.

03:19.324 --> 03:21.118
We know the same amount of stuff.

03:21.201 --> 03:23.745
We're the same person. Stop trying
to act like you're smarter than me.

03:23.829 --> 03:27.583
Created by cartoonist Alison Bechdel,
it asks whether...

03:27.666 --> 03:29.459
Sorry. I have pee anxiety.

03:29.543 --> 03:30.961
Can you, like...?

03:33.547 --> 03:36.383
It asks whether a movie
or, like, a work of fiction,

03:36.466 --> 03:39.052
um, has at least two female characters,

03:39.136 --> 03:41.805
and then the two characters
have to talk about something

03:41.889 --> 03:43.223
other than a man.

03:43.307 --> 03:44.975
- But aren't there, like, three things?

03:45.058 --> 03:46.894
- Yeah. There's, like,
more to it than that.

03:46.977 --> 03:50.355
I think, um, one of the things is, like...

03:50.439 --> 03:52.983
um, do they both have names?
- Yeah. We have names.

03:53.066 --> 03:55.068
- Yeah. I mean, mine's kind of
a boy's name. I don't...

03:55.152 --> 03:57.237
- Yeah, I don't think that matters.
- Okay. It doesn't matter. Um...

03:57.321 --> 03:59.364
So, then...
What's the third thing?

03:59.448 --> 04:02.075
- Isn't it just, like,
that there are two women?

04:02.159 --> 04:04.453
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay, so one...
- Yeah.

04:04.536 --> 04:05.871
- Are there two women?
- Yeah.

04:05.954 --> 04:07.247
- Which, you know, there are.

04:07.331 --> 04:09.333
And then two, do they both have names?

04:09.416 --> 04:10.876
- They have names.
- And three, do they talk

04:10.959 --> 04:12.211
about something other than a man?
- Yeah.

04:12.294 --> 04:15.005
- Okay. So all we have to do to pass this
is just not talk about men.

04:15.088 --> 04:16.507
- Oh, my God, we're gonna be
so good at this.

04:16.590 --> 04:18.091
- Okay, so, Bechdel test?

04:18.175 --> 04:20.093
- Yes!
- Starting...

04:20.177 --> 04:21.678
now!
- Now!

04:21.762 --> 04:23.972
Oh, my God, we're gonna be
the best feminist-y feminists

04:24.056 --> 04:25.265
that were ever feminists!

04:35.275 --> 04:37.194
Really pretty out here, huh?

04:37.277 --> 04:39.363
- Yeah. I love it.

04:39.446 --> 04:41.406
Growing up, my dad used to take...

04:41.490 --> 04:43.325
- Ooh!
- What?

04:43.408 --> 04:44.910
- Oh, just like, your dad.

04:44.993 --> 04:46.286
He's a man, right?

04:46.370 --> 04:48.413
- Oh. Oh, right. Shit!

04:48.497 --> 04:50.415
Okay. Yeah, okay, start over, start over?

04:50.499 --> 04:52.042
- Yeah. Okay, ready?
- Okay, okay, ready?

04:52.125 --> 04:53.460
- Bechdel test starting...
-Starting...

04:53.544 --> 04:54.920
-now.
-now. Okay.

04:57.089 --> 04:59.383
- Ugh. Look at that.

04:59.466 --> 05:02.219
The fact that 53% of white women

05:02.302 --> 05:05.848
hated themselves enough to vote
for that bloated orangutan...

05:05.931 --> 05:07.641
- Ooh.
- What?

05:07.724 --> 05:09.142
- Well...

05:09.226 --> 05:11.603
- Oh, my God, you fucking voted for Trump.

05:11.687 --> 05:13.105
Oh, that makes so much sense.

05:13.188 --> 05:14.815
- What? No. No! Oh, my God.

05:14.898 --> 05:18.360
No, I'm saying, Trump is a man, Bechdel.

05:18.443 --> 05:20.153
- Oh, shit!
- Right?

05:20.237 --> 05:23.031
- Oh, my God, this is
so much harder than I thought.

05:23.115 --> 05:24.032
- I know! Jesus!

05:24.116 --> 05:25.409
- Ooh.
- What?

05:25.492 --> 05:27.369
- Well, Jesus, like,
that's kind of a guy, right?

05:27.452 --> 05:29.288
- Oh, come on. Come on.

05:29.371 --> 05:31.206
- #BechdelFail on you right now, bitch.

05:31.290 --> 05:33.208
- No. Okay, okay, okay,
come on, come on, come on.

05:33.292 --> 05:34.960
- Okay.
- Ready? And...

05:35.043 --> 05:36.128
Bechdel!
- Bechdel!

05:41.800 --> 05:42.843
- What's your, um...
- You know...

05:42.926 --> 05:44.928
- No. Uh, no, no, no,
sorry, you go ahead.

05:45.012 --> 05:46.263
- You absolutely can go.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.307
- I didn't have anything.

05:48.390 --> 05:50.100
- Me, neither.
- Fuck!

05:50.184 --> 05:52.644
Why is it so hard to talk about
something that isn't a dude?

05:52.728 --> 05:55.189
- I don't know! I hate this!

05:55.272 --> 05:58.567
We shouldn't be forcing it, you know?

05:58.650 --> 06:00.736
- Yeah. Like, I feel like if we stop

06:00.819 --> 06:03.030
thinking about it,
it'll just, like, come to us.

06:03.113 --> 06:05.282
- We should just, like,
think about something else.

06:05.365 --> 06:07.117
- Yeah, we can talk about...

06:07.201 --> 06:09.244
anything else.
- Yeah, like, anything.

06:09.328 --> 06:11.538
-Yeah. I mean, we can talk about this beer

06:11.622 --> 06:13.332
and, like, the...
- Uh-huh.

06:13.415 --> 06:14.875
- ...store, how gross it is.

06:14.958 --> 06:16.502
We can talk about...

06:16.585 --> 06:19.171
that woman over there.
- Yes, we could totally talk

06:19.254 --> 06:21.465
about the crack whore.
- Oh, my God, you're so bad.

06:21.548 --> 06:23.175
- Do you know what I'm thinking?
- What?

06:23.258 --> 06:25.385
- I feel like her discharge
would be, like, booger-y.

06:25.469 --> 06:26.678
- My God, you're so gross.

06:26.762 --> 06:27.971
I know what you're talking about.

06:28.055 --> 06:29.765
Like, when it's, like, you could use it

06:29.848 --> 06:32.184
- as an adhesive
for arts and crafts. Gross.
- Yes!

06:32.267 --> 06:34.853
It's, like, go bedazzle some shit.
- Oh, my God, shut up.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.150
I don't know, does that seem weird?

06:40.234 --> 06:42.653
- What?
- I don't know, just, like...

06:42.736 --> 06:45.072
you know, that we could be,
like, talking shit

06:45.155 --> 06:47.366
about another woman
and still pass the Bechdel test?

06:47.449 --> 06:48.742
- Yeah, I do know what you mean.

06:48.825 --> 06:50.369
- And, like, also,
are you saying that, like,

06:50.452 --> 06:51.787
we could have one conversation?

06:51.870 --> 06:53.247
Like, we could talk about dudes all day,

06:53.330 --> 06:54.831
and we have
one conversation about, like,

06:54.915 --> 06:56.333
"How many calories are
in these plantain chips?"

06:56.416 --> 06:58.335
and we'd still pass?
- Yeah, we're thinking about it

06:58.418 --> 07:00.128
like we can't talk about dudes,
but really, we just have to

07:00.212 --> 07:02.339
talk shit about a lady first,
and then we can go back

07:02.422 --> 07:04.341
to talking about dudes, right?
- I mean, like, we did it.

07:04.424 --> 07:05.968
- We totally passed!
- All right!

07:06.051 --> 07:07.594
- Okay, amazing.
So we could talk about guys again.

07:07.678 --> 07:10.138
That is so good, because
I've been wanting to tell you,

07:10.222 --> 07:11.306
there's this guy...

07:11.390 --> 07:13.350
- Open the fucking register now!

07:13.433 --> 07:15.352
Now! Come on, I want everything,
you hear me?

07:15.435 --> 07:17.855
I want everything!
Everybody get your hands up.
- Barbara, get down!
