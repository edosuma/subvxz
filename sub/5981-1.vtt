02:32.694 --> 02:37.281
- (geese) Quack, quack.
- Look out!

02:37.449 --> 02:39.700
He singed my tail feathers.

02:40.786 --> 02:41.994
Yee-ha!

02:46.416 --> 02:48.251
All right, Buzz. That's enough of that.

02:49.920 --> 02:52.338
(objects falling)

02:52.923 --> 02:55.258
What did I just say?

02:55.592 --> 02:57.802
That is a good way to lose an eye, my friend.

02:58.387 --> 03:00.638
Hold it. We've got company at two o'clock.

03:01.306 --> 03:02.557
I got him, Mailman. Hang on.

03:04.101 --> 03:05.935
Here we go.

03:08.230 --> 03:11.357
- Buzz, what is goin' on up there?
- Just movin' a road hog.

03:12.693 --> 03:14.443
(horn)

03:15.612 --> 03:18.906
- Knock it off! What kind of stunt was that?
- Just seein' what this baby can do.

03:21.869 --> 03:24.245
This bag of bones isn't rated past Mach two.

03:25.455 --> 03:29.375
- Mach one!
- The G-forces, Buzz! The G-forces!

03:29.543 --> 03:31.627
Mach two! Gotta push the envelope.

03:33.338 --> 03:35.214
Mach three!

03:35.799 --> 03:37.967
Buzz! We're tearing apart!

03:40.554 --> 03:44.557
I'm losin' control.
Eject, Mailman. Hit the silk!

03:46.059 --> 03:48.811
- I can't get out!
- What are you doing?

03:49.479 --> 03:51.564
Buzz! Get back here!

03:52.107 --> 03:54.650
OK. I've been in tougher scrapes than this.

03:54.776 --> 03:58.112
There's the ground. It looks hard. OK, trees.

03:58.238 --> 04:00.406
No! Oh. Mahogany. Ow!

04:00.490 --> 04:02.742
Squirrel's nest. Bird. Ow! Pine.

04:02.826 --> 04:04.493
Ow! Oh, the ground.

04:05.162 --> 04:07.204
Oh... Oh...

04:07.289 --> 04:09.832
Oh, I made it.

04:09.958 --> 04:13.002
I made it! There is a God.

04:13.670 --> 04:15.671
Hallelujaaaaaa!

04:15.881 --> 04:20.216
Ow! Oh! Ouch! Ow!

04:24.014 --> 04:26.515
Oh, you're French, aren't you?

04:26.642 --> 04:28.684
Ah... yeah, just like that.

04:41.615 --> 04:44.241

- (hooter)

04:47.955 --> 04:50.039
- (man) Hey, look! There's one!
- Uh-oh.

05:24.825 --> 05:26.158
(spraying)

05:32.624 --> 05:35.084
(chains and bolts being undone)

05:42.592 --> 05:44.802
Topper Harley?

05:45.137 --> 05:47.096
Once, perhaps.

05:47.180 --> 05:49.098
Now I am called Tukachinchilla.

05:49.933 --> 05:52.393
- What does it mean?
- Fluffy Bunny Feet.

05:55.564 --> 05:57.356
It's very nice.

05:57.482 --> 05:59.608
I'm Lieutenant Commander James Block.

05:59.735 --> 06:00.943
I knew your father Buzz.

06:03.238 --> 06:05.531
Until his incident, he was
the greatest pilot who ever lived.

06:08.785 --> 06:10.036
We need to talk.

06:23.300 --> 06:24.800
- The Navy wants...
- (yelp)

06:32.267 --> 06:33.476
The Navy wants you back, Harley.

06:34.561 --> 06:37.646
They threw me out. Why should I go back?

06:38.607 --> 06:41.942
I came here to get away from the Navy.
Away from flying.

06:50.994 --> 06:52.286
(hissing)

06:56.750 --> 07:00.086
(helium voice) The Navy has
a top-secret mission: Sleepy Weasel.

07:00.170 --> 07:03.255
I'm giving you a second chance,
which your father never had.

07:03.340 --> 07:05.466
You're the best of the best, Topper.

07:08.011 --> 07:13.015
(helium voice) Leave me to speak with the
one. He is wise in the ways of such things.

07:17.395 --> 07:18.979
The Navy really needs you.

07:19.606 --> 07:20.981
Great helium!

07:25.237 --> 07:26.445
Owatonna.

07:28.448 --> 07:29.490
Owatonna!

08:07.028 --> 08:08.904

08:14.244 --> 08:17.830
Every night I hope and pray

08:17.998 --> 08:21.417
A dream lover will come my way

08:21.501 --> 08:25.171
A girl to hold in my arms

08:37.601 --> 08:41.437
I don't have to dream alone

08:43.356 --> 08:46.692
Dream lover, until then

08:46.776 --> 08:50.196
I'll go to sleep, I'll dream again

Dream lover, until then

09:15.847 --> 09:19.308
I'll go to sleep, I'll dream again

Wha-hoo!

10:10.318 --> 10:11.902
(military march)

10:22.372 --> 10:24.456
(drill sergeant) Ten... hut!

10:35.635 --> 10:37.720
Admiral. Good to see you again, sir.

10:37.804 --> 10:40.431
- It's been too long.
- And so it has. Yes, yes.

10:40.515 --> 10:42.558
- How are ya, sir?
- Hawaii?

10:42.684 --> 10:46.979
- Goddamn it, Bill, I should be in California.
- No, sir, this is California.

10:47.063 --> 10:51.066
- Well, gotta run. Good luck.
- But, sir, this is your command.

10:51.484 --> 10:55.904
Sleepy Weasel has been planned for
ten months. The president hand-picked you.

10:55.989 --> 10:58.574
Damn right he did.
No stoppin' us now, huh, Ted?

10:58.700 --> 11:04.288
- I'll show you your offices and brief you.
- You're a fine soldier, Scott. Lead the way.

11:04.414 --> 11:06.457
Oh, good God. I gotta pee.

11:06.541 --> 11:09.501
I had part of my bladder
blown off at Guadalcanal.

11:10.211 --> 11:12.921
Watch your step.
There's a lot of obstructions here.

11:13.798 --> 11:16.759
- I had a little dreidel!
- (men) I made it out of clay!

11:16.843 --> 11:20.471
- And when it's dry and ready...
- My dreidel I will play!

11:20.555 --> 11:23.474
- Here's the story...
- Of a lovely lady!

11:23.558 --> 11:26.852
- Who was bringing up...
- Three very lovely girls!

11:26.936 --> 11:29.813
- All of them had hair of gold!
- Like their mother!

11:29.898 --> 11:32.358
- The youngest one...
- In curls!

11:32.442 --> 11:34.693
- Here's the story...
- Of a man named Brady!

11:44.496 --> 11:46.580
Gentlemen, he's back.

11:46.748 --> 11:47.956
(cheers)

11:48.500 --> 11:50.584
How ya been?

11:51.711 --> 11:54.338
- Yeah, it's the big guy.
- Good to see ya.

11:54.464 --> 11:57.341
- Scooter! How you doin'?
- Topper. The main man.

11:58.343 --> 12:01.428
- Rabbi! Mazel tov.
- You should live and be well!

12:01.513 --> 12:03.097
(glass smashes)

12:19.364 --> 12:21.323
Hey, buddy.

12:21.408 --> 12:23.283
Are you OK?

12:23.368 --> 12:25.744
You don't look so hot. You need some help?

12:25.829 --> 12:27.871
I'm OK.

12:29.124 --> 12:31.083
You're Topper Harley, aren't you?

12:31.167 --> 12:35.421
I hear you've got chops we only dream of.
Throwin' you out was a bum rap.

12:35.588 --> 12:38.757
I'm Jim Pfaffenbach.
Everybody calls me Wash Out.

12:40.427 --> 12:43.929
- You're a pilot?
- Oh, yeah. I'm gonna be flyin' with ya.

12:45.181 --> 12:47.099
Good.

12:48.017 --> 12:49.143
Phew.

12:52.313 --> 12:53.647
(whistles)

12:54.607 --> 12:55.691
Cute.

12:57.026 --> 12:59.361
I like to stay in shape. Thanks.

12:59.529 --> 13:01.780
- Are these all at home?
- Yeah.

13:02.198 --> 13:04.700
The dogs, wife and kids.

13:05.910 --> 13:08.203
You got pictures of your family,
I'd love to see 'em.

13:09.122 --> 13:13.375
- I am my family photo.
- But everybody needs a family to love.

13:14.043 --> 13:19.006
I could never find time for love. It's
too heavy. It's an anchor that drowns a man.

13:19.090 --> 13:22.926
Besides, I got the sky,
the smell of jet exhaust, my bike.

13:23.011 --> 13:24.887
- A loner?
- No. I own it.

13:26.681 --> 13:29.391
I can see I'm gonna have to work on you.

13:29.476 --> 13:31.602
Name's Pete Thompson. But...

13:33.229 --> 13:35.522
...everybody calls me Dead Meat.

13:36.024 --> 13:38.192
- Topper Harley.
- Just a pleasure.

13:42.697 --> 13:44.865
- (door opens)
- Attention on deck!

13:46.242 --> 13:48.285
(men) Good morning, sir!

13:49.662 --> 13:52.247
I don't care
how many missions you've flown!

13:52.332 --> 13:56.543
I don't care how good you think you are!
You're nobody!

13:56.753 --> 14:00.839
And for the next ten days,
nobody takes a crap unless I say so!

14:00.924 --> 14:03.425
- Got it?
- Yes, sir!

14:04.427 --> 14:06.136
I said "Attention".

14:06.804 --> 14:10.265
Now, didn't I make myself clear?
Or don't you take orders?

14:10.350 --> 14:13.685
- When I say "Attention", I mean "Attention".
- Yes, sir!

14:13.770 --> 14:15.270
- Now!
- (boing!)

14:22.111 --> 14:25.197
- You eyeballin' me, mister?
- No, sir!

14:25.281 --> 14:30.118
The next time I see that ugly face of yours,
I want it clean-shaven! Suck in that chest!

14:34.624 --> 14:35.999
Pfaffenbach!

14:38.711 --> 14:41.880
- What you lookin' at, boy?
- Nothin', sir!

14:41.965 --> 14:45.300
Oh, I'm some lowlife that's
not good enough for you to talk to?

14:45.385 --> 14:50.013
Well, that attitude is short on collateral!
I'm God as far as you're concerned!

14:50.139 --> 14:51.640
Hey, hey. Lighten up.

14:52.976 --> 14:54.726
Cut the kid some slack.

14:56.646 --> 14:58.313
Who the hell are you talkin' to, son?

14:59.649 --> 15:02.317
Your ego's writin' cheques
your body can't cash.

15:02.527 --> 15:04.945
Now you got five minutes
to stow your gear.

15:05.029 --> 15:06.405
Get movin'!

15:09.492 --> 15:12.202
Yeah, I'm sure deep down he means well.

15:14.831 --> 15:16.790
I hope you were paying attention.

15:16.874 --> 15:20.502
- I don't think we've met.
- Kent Gregory.

15:20.587 --> 15:22.588
Excuse me if I don't shake your hand.

15:22.672 --> 15:28.218
Your father killed someone very special
to me: Dominic "Mailman" Farnham.

15:28.303 --> 15:29.970
- You mean...
- Yes.

15:30.054 --> 15:32.806
Dominic Farnham was my father.
I was his love child.

15:33.683 --> 15:36.643
- It was a hunting accident.
- Accident, my deep-blue eyes.

15:36.894 --> 15:40.147
It was reckless, irresponsible flying,
and you know it.

15:40.231 --> 15:41.607
Are you OK?

15:42.692 --> 15:44.943
This is an incredible coincidence,

15:45.028 --> 15:46.945
but the hunter who mistakenly
killed your father

15:51.909 --> 15:55.120
was Henry Pfaffenbach, my father.

15:57.248 --> 15:58.874
I feel terrible.

15:59.459 --> 16:01.877
Isn't this Henry Alva Pfaffenbach?

16:02.629 --> 16:04.755
My mother was a Pfaffenbach.

16:05.131 --> 16:07.758
Not... Doreen Pfaffenbach?

16:08.051 --> 16:09.968
- From Minnesota?
- Yeah.

16:10.553 --> 16:14.056
Then we're cousins! We used to
spend our summers in Eagle River.

16:14.307 --> 16:16.099
(pilots) Eagle River?

16:16.434 --> 16:18.935
I hope you can forgive me for this.

16:20.563 --> 16:23.065
If it helps, I didn't have seconds.

16:24.108 --> 16:28.654
That's all right. It's not your fault.
Anyone could have made that mistake.

16:29.280 --> 16:33.659
But him... he's the type that could
end up killing every man in this outfit.

16:33.993 --> 16:37.746
Wait a minute. Why are you mad at me?
He's the one who ate your father.

16:39.582 --> 16:42.751
Like father, like son.
You've already been tossed out once.

16:43.419 --> 16:45.045
Hold it, hold it.

16:45.588 --> 16:49.424
We can't fight among ourselves.
We're all on the same team here.

16:49.759 --> 16:52.386
I want the two of you to shake hands.

16:56.933 --> 16:59.434
There, now. Isn't that better?

17:00.019 --> 17:01.645
- (falsetto) Yeah.
- (falsetto) Sure.

17:04.272 --> 17:05.982
There. We're friends again.

17:07.193 --> 17:09.819
Here. Have some of my lucky gum.

17:11.155 --> 17:15.534
Look, Dead Meat. We fly together,
we sleep next to each other, but that's all.

17:15.952 --> 17:19.121
Don't get too close.
Let me handle my own affairs.

17:22.959 --> 17:24.542
He's so complex.

17:27.003 --> 17:30.173
Aerial photos and recon reports
indicate a defensive arsenal

17:30.258 --> 17:32.467
in the D, and perhaps -C, categories.

17:32.552 --> 17:34.970
There's also some anti-aircraft squadrons.

17:35.054 --> 17:39.391
They can send up an ack-ack umbrella
high enough to make any attack ineffective.

17:39.475 --> 17:42.728
I don't have a clue
what you're talkin' about, Phil.

17:42.812 --> 17:46.732
I have a shell the size of a fist in my head
Pork Chop Hill.

17:46.816 --> 17:48.775
The only way I can make this toup stay on

17:48.860 --> 17:52.446
is by magnetising the upper left
quadrant of my skull.

17:52.530 --> 17:55.741
You just go ahead and do what you do.
Do you have any soup?

17:55.825 --> 17:59.327
Of course, sir. I'll have the mess
bring something right up.

17:59.412 --> 18:02.164
I love soup. I mean, I think I love soup.

18:02.248 --> 18:05.792
Son-of-a-bitchin' shell. It's either
soup or duck. Which one do you shoot?

18:05.918 --> 18:07.043
Duck, sir.

18:09.297 --> 18:12.048
- Are you all right, sir?
- Of course I'm all right.

18:12.133 --> 18:13.675
Why? What have you heard?

18:15.052 --> 18:16.511
Nothing, sir.

18:16.763 --> 18:18.972
Send some soup up for the admiral,
on the double.

18:19.056 --> 18:22.684
Let's go over this Slippery Weevil
one more time.

18:22.769 --> 18:28.273
I wanna familiarise myself with it as much
as I possibly can. So... give it to me, Ben.

18:28.357 --> 18:30.442
Every word. Every detail.

18:30.526 --> 18:32.110
Dot every comma.

19:00.056 --> 19:01.598
(unscrewing light bulb)

19:14.028 --> 19:15.779
Those are some long legs.

19:16.364 --> 19:20.075
I just had them lengthened.
Now they go all the way up.

19:20.493 --> 19:21.576
Wow.

19:21.828 --> 19:23.078
It's nice to see you again.

19:24.080 --> 19:26.498
I was really impressed,
the way you handled that stallion.

19:26.582 --> 19:31.503
When I saw you dig your heels into his sides
tighten the reins and break his spirit,

19:31.587 --> 19:33.547
I never wanted to be a horse
so much in my life.

19:34.632 --> 19:38.218
After I finish off this shrink,
we can take a quick canter in the meadow.

19:38.636 --> 19:40.428
Lieutenant, I am the shrink.

19:41.556 --> 19:45.183
- You're the psychiatrist?
- That's what the diploma says.

19:45.268 --> 19:48.645
I've never been to a psychiatrist before.
You will be gentle?

19:48.729 --> 19:50.063
(dog yaps)

19:52.233 --> 19:54.526
I've been ordered to review your records.

19:54.610 --> 19:59.322
You were discharged from the service
18 months ago for wilful insubordination.

20:00.575 --> 20:05.370
You disobeyed a direct order
and lost a $13m fighter in the process.

20:05.454 --> 20:09.249
Yes, I did. But I'm payin' it off
at ten bucks a week.

20:09.333 --> 20:12.627
I should have gotten
that extra collision coverage.

20:13.296 --> 20:15.881
Wasn't your father involved
in a similar incident?

20:16.257 --> 20:19.050
- What do you mean?
- Leland "Buzz" Harley.

20:19.135 --> 20:22.053
Three Purple Hearts,
presidential commendation.

20:22.138 --> 20:24.598
Then this incident,
the Dominic Farnham death.

20:24.974 --> 20:27.976
1971, his Visa card was cancelled.

20:28.060 --> 20:30.353
1975, a broken man,

20:30.438 --> 20:33.648
suffocated while working
the night shift in a Fotomat booth.

20:36.027 --> 20:37.903
Tell me how these events affected you.

20:40.072 --> 20:42.365
Well, I... I don't think about it much.

20:42.450 --> 20:45.452
That was a long time ago.

20:45.828 --> 20:48.163
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have some guns to grease.

20:49.165 --> 20:50.457
Lieutenant...

20:50.541 --> 20:53.668
Have you thought about
seeing a psychiatrist on a regular basis?

20:54.170 --> 20:56.171
I thought you'd never ask.

20:56.505 --> 20:57.923
I mean professionally.

21:00.176 --> 21:01.718
Thanks, Doctor.

21:02.511 --> 21:04.346
Thanks for the advice.

21:04.680 --> 21:07.974
- Be careful out there.
- I can take care of myself.

21:08.142 --> 21:12.020
- No. You're going to get hurt.
- I don't need your help, or anybody's.

21:12.104 --> 21:13.438
I'll be just fine.

21:18.486 --> 21:19.861
Are you OK?

21:24.909 --> 21:28.161
Yeah. I'm fine.

21:30.873 --> 21:32.832
(Topper, shakily) Oh...

21:35.503 --> 21:37.170
Attention on deck.

21:37.880 --> 21:38.922
At ease, men.

21:43.260 --> 21:44.302
Be seated.

21:47.056 --> 21:51.768
Many of you are wondering about my pants.
Well, they ran short of material at the knee.

21:51.852 --> 21:53.895
So don't give me any shit.

21:54.647 --> 21:58.233
Now, I look out there
at all of you guys and I say to myself:

21:58.317 --> 22:01.653
What I wouldn't give
to be 20 years younger,

22:01.737 --> 22:02.862
and a woman.

22:04.490 --> 22:09.327
You know, I've flown over 194 missions,
and I was shot down on every one.

22:09.412 --> 22:13.748
Come to think of it, I've never
landed a plane in my life. Now,

22:13.833 --> 22:18.044
you men'll be piloting the backbone
of our proud American arsenal:

22:18.129 --> 22:22.298
The Oscar EW 5894 Phallus
tactical fighter bomber.

22:22.383 --> 22:26.636
Its lightweight sweptwing design
makes it extremely manoeuvrable and agile.

22:26.721 --> 22:32.684
Beneath its 21st-century skin is a highly
advanced avionics and weapons package.

22:32.768 --> 22:35.395
Designed for speed and combat acrobatics,

22:35.479 --> 22:40.442
it features the latest Mrs Halver
series 3800 radar-jamming Framus.

22:42.945 --> 22:44.696
- Admiral.
- Nurse.

22:44.780 --> 22:49.200
(Block) Sleepy Weasel's success depends
on our manoeuvring below enemy radar.

22:49.285 --> 22:53.538
I wanna see a major display of low-level
flying. Topper, Kent, you're up first.

22:53.622 --> 22:57.042
- Show me what you can do.
- Copy that, Purple Fluffer Nutter.

22:57.126 --> 22:59.127
Roger that, Milli Vanilli Chilly Willy.

23:02.423 --> 23:07.635
Bring 'em down, boys. I want your bellies to
scrape the sagebrush. Let's see who's best.

23:07.762 --> 23:10.013
(Kent) I'm heading for the canyon floor.

23:15.061 --> 23:18.563
- For your information, I'm at 150 feet.
- I'm at 3rd and Main.

23:27.823 --> 23:30.617
Very pretty,
but enough hot-dogging, Harley.

23:30.951 --> 23:32.786
Just checkin' the traffic.

23:38.459 --> 23:41.336
- How'd I do, big fella?
- Don't get me started, Harley.

23:41.462 --> 23:44.756
Cut the chatter. Topper,
that was vintage Buzz Harley.

23:44.840 --> 23:47.342
You and your dad are two of a kind. (echoes)

23:47.468 --> 23:50.011
Your ego's writin' cheques
your body can't cash.

23:53.682 --> 23:55.850
(Block) Topper! Get back in formation!

24:01.524 --> 24:02.899
(Block) Topper, you weren't clear to detach.

24:06.320 --> 24:10.281
- What was that all about?
- I, uh... thought I saw Elvis.

24:10.783 --> 24:13.201
Let it go, Topper.
The King is gone. Let's head for home.

24:25.047 --> 24:26.381
Not again!

24:27.383 --> 24:31.636
I need a landing clearance
for runway 30... 30 something.

24:31.720 --> 24:35.223
30-thirty-something's been cancelled.
Go to runway 2-niner.

24:39.019 --> 24:40.687
(Block) Wash Out, what the hell
are you doin'? Pull it up.

24:44.066 --> 24:48.987
Wash Out, where the hell are you?
What is your location? You're off of radar.

24:49.071 --> 24:50.572
Repeat: What is your location?

24:50.656 --> 24:53.700
It's not unusual to be loved by anyone

24:58.747 --> 25:00.582
- Goin' up?
- Yes.

25:10.926 --> 25:12.594
Can I press your button?

25:12.678 --> 25:17.098
No, you've been slavin' over hot psychotics
all day. Let me get that.

25:23.022 --> 25:26.691
- Interesting perfume.
- It's Vicks. I have a cold.

25:26.775 --> 25:27.817
Ah.

25:29.612 --> 25:32.071
Lieutenant, you're staring.

25:32.156 --> 25:35.033
No, not really. I'm lost in your eyes.

25:36.118 --> 25:40.955
That is the whitest white part of the eye
I've ever seen. Do you floss?

25:41.415 --> 25:43.291
You're very confident, aren't you?

25:43.876 --> 25:47.545
When you have 10,000 pounds of thrust
at your command, you have to be.

25:48.005 --> 25:51.633
Lieutenant, please.
I'm talking to you as a psychiatrist.

25:53.427 --> 25:56.054
I'm recommending that you be grounded.

25:56.931 --> 26:00.350
- You've got to be joking.
- If I were joking, I'd have said...

26:00.434 --> 26:02.393
"What do you do
with an elephant with three balls?"

26:03.562 --> 26:05.271
"You walk him and pitch to the rhino."

26:06.607 --> 26:10.485
- You are serious.
- It's the best thing for you, and the mission.

26:10.569 --> 26:14.030
The best would be
if you'd stop tryin' to run my life.

26:14.114 --> 26:16.908
I'm a pilot, and nobody's gonna
keep me out of the sky.

26:20.371 --> 26:23.456
Ladies and gentlemen!
Twelve rounds of boxing

26:23.540 --> 26:27.919
for the WBA WBC WPA RSVP

26:28.003 --> 26:31.005
Heavyweight Championship of the World!

26:31.799 --> 26:34.342
Introducing celebrities at ringside,

26:34.426 --> 26:38.346
please welcome His Holiness,
the very popular pontiff,

26:38.430 --> 26:42.350
- Pope John Paul II!
- (cheering and whistling)

26:42.434 --> 26:43.685
Second!

26:47.523 --> 26:50.441
Lieutenant Commander Block.
We meet at last.

26:50.526 --> 26:55.154
- Isn't this place a little public?
- No, a crowd offers remarkable anonymity.

26:56.198 --> 26:58.241
How are we doing at Dudley?

26:58.325 --> 27:00.451
Oh, we're right on schedule.

27:00.703 --> 27:02.203
Can't quite get a reading
on Admiral Benson,

27:02.288 --> 27:05.623
but Topper Harley's playing into our hands.

27:05.708 --> 27:10.211
Here's his evaluation. A clear-cut case
of Paternal Conflict Syndrome.

27:10.629 --> 27:12.463
Ah, yes. PCS.

27:12.548 --> 27:17.051
I saw an Afterschool Special on that.
They're years away from a vaccine.

27:17.177 --> 27:20.805
Every time I mention Buzz's name,
Topper goes off.

27:20.889 --> 27:23.683
There's no way the unit will function,
and I'll abort the mission.

27:25.144 --> 27:30.440
The Navy's planes will seem inferior and
the president will beg for my superfighter.

27:31.108 --> 27:33.693
And, best of all, nobody gets hurt.

27:33.777 --> 27:36.112
Well done, Lieutenant Commander.

27:36.739 --> 27:40.575
America can't afford to fall behind,
Mr Wilson. We need your plane.

27:41.577 --> 27:44.078
This should be a good match.
Both men work for Don King.

27:44.204 --> 27:45.538
(bell)

27:49.126 --> 27:52.086
- (crowd boos)
- Well, fans, that's it.

27:52.171 --> 27:54.797
Good night. I'm outta here!

27:55.966 --> 27:59.802
(MC) The Strafing Run
proudly presents Lawrence Lipps!

27:59.887 --> 28:02.013
And now...

28:02.348 --> 28:03.639
What the world needs

28:03.724 --> 28:04.932
Thank you!

28:05.017 --> 28:06.017
Is love

28:06.101 --> 28:07.268
Thank you so much!

28:07.436 --> 28:11.856
That's the only thing
that there's just too darn little of

28:15.152 --> 28:16.527
(cheering)

28:21.033 --> 28:23.117
Ramada?

28:23.619 --> 28:25.953
- Kent!
- Ramada!

28:26.872 --> 28:29.791
Qu'est-ce que je suis contente de te revoir.

28:30.459 --> 28:33.002
- (glass smashes)
- (woman) Argh! My eyes!

28:33.087 --> 28:35.963
Darling, I thought you were still in Brussel.

28:36.048 --> 28:38.633
Oh, Kent. We were only hurting each other.

28:38.759 --> 28:40.259
I thought that's the way you wanted it.

28:42.304 --> 28:47.517
Something's changed. It's not another
woman, is it? I couldn't compete with that.

28:47.601 --> 28:49.811
No, of course you couldn't.

28:50.521 --> 28:54.982
Well, what matters is that you're here.
We've a lot of catching up to do.

28:55.067 --> 28:58.277
Wonderful. Just let me
take care of something.

28:58.404 --> 29:01.155
- Don't be long, mon amour.
- Absolument.

29:02.491 --> 29:03.908
(jazzy intro)

29:15.796 --> 29:18.297
Some day he'll come along

29:19.299 --> 29:21.342
The man I love

29:21.969 --> 29:24.262
And he'll be big and strong

29:25.180 --> 29:26.973
The man I love

29:28.350 --> 29:30.601
And when he comes my way

29:31.019 --> 29:33.062
I'll do my best

29:33.522 --> 29:37.608
To make... him... stay

29:40.696 --> 29:43.197
He'll look at me and smile

29:44.032 --> 29:46.534
I'll understand

29:47.202 --> 29:49.495
And in a little while

29:49.830 --> 29:52.081
He'll take my hand

29:53.375 --> 29:56.002
And though it seems absurd

29:56.336 --> 30:02.717
I know we both... won't say... a... word

30:03.802 --> 30:05.428
Wow!

30:06.513 --> 30:08.347
Anybody here from out of town?

30:09.057 --> 30:12.393
Welcome. Nice to see you.

30:15.063 --> 30:19.400
Maybe I shall meet him someday

30:20.360 --> 30:22.487
Maybe Monday

30:23.197 --> 30:25.364
Maybe not

30:27.993 --> 30:31.412
Still I'm sure to meet him one day

30:32.581 --> 30:34.624
Maybe Tuesday

30:35.000 --> 30:39.212
Will be my good-news day

30:52.100 --> 30:55.228
We'll build a little home

30:55.312 --> 30:57.897
Just meant for two

30:58.273 --> 31:01.025
From which I'll never roam

31:01.443 --> 31:03.945
Who would? Would you?

31:04.446 --> 31:07.114
And so all else above

31:07.616 --> 31:09.659
I'm dreaming of

31:09.743 --> 31:14.872
The man... I... love

31:15.082 --> 31:18.042
One day he'll come along

31:19.127 --> 31:21.003
He'll be big and strong

31:22.130 --> 31:24.257
And when he comes my way

31:24.341 --> 31:27.385
I'll do my best to make him stay

31:27.469 --> 31:31.472
And so all else above

31:31.557 --> 31:33.599
I'm dreamin' of

31:33.684 --> 31:40.648
The man I love

31:41.525 --> 31:45.653
(flamboyant finish on piano)

31:45.737 --> 31:47.071
(cheering)

31:51.243 --> 31:53.327
- Ramada...
- Oh, no.

31:53.912 --> 31:56.998
Well, if it isn't God's gift to the cockpit.

31:58.166 --> 32:02.503
- Kent, your nostrils are flaring.
- That flying stunt today was pure madness.

32:02.588 --> 32:06.090
If a lady wasn't present,
I'd tear you apart like a Christmas goose.

32:06.341 --> 32:09.677
Yeah? Keep it up, you'll be carrying
your face home in a doggy bag.

32:09.928 --> 32:11.304
What is this macho thing?

32:12.347 --> 32:13.848
- He started it.
- Did not.

32:14.349 --> 32:15.558
- Did too.
- Did not.

32:15.642 --> 32:18.352
- You're behaving like children.
- He's a jerk.

32:18.437 --> 32:20.021
- Am not.
- Are too.

32:20.105 --> 32:21.981
- Am not.
- Are too too too...

32:22.065 --> 32:23.691
- Not not not...
...too too too...

32:23.817 --> 32:25.484
Are too times ten.

32:26.153 --> 32:28.029
- That's it.
- Stop it.

32:28.113 --> 32:29.697
- (woman) Rumble!
- Don't push me.

32:38.707 --> 32:42.418
Stop it! Can't you act
like civilised human beings?

32:42.544 --> 32:45.171
- (man) Hey, I'm sorry.
- I love you, pal.

32:48.133 --> 32:52.219
Listen. Kent and I have to talk, so please...

32:53.305 --> 32:54.722
Be my guest.

33:04.399 --> 33:06.317
Let's celebrate, honey.

33:06.818 --> 33:08.653
Hey, everybody. Drinks are on me.

33:08.737 --> 33:10.488
- Free beer!
- I want a gin sling!

33:22.167 --> 33:24.960
You haven't forgotten my offer, have you?

33:25.379 --> 33:29.173
Little house in the country,
white picket fence, StairMaster.

33:29.591 --> 33:32.218
Kent, you're everything
a woman could possibly want.

33:33.303 --> 33:36.263
But I'm just not ready for marriage. Not yet.

33:37.724 --> 33:41.352
Well, I have to get back to the base.
Tomorrow's an important flight.

33:41.603 --> 33:43.938
You know how puffy my eyes get
when I don't get enough rest.

33:47.484 --> 33:48.859
Good night.

33:53.824 --> 33:54.990
May I?

33:56.493 --> 33:59.870
- Shouldn't you be getting back to the base?
- I suppose,

33:59.955 --> 34:02.248
if I played life by the rules,
but you know I don't.

34:03.458 --> 34:06.335
All right. You can walk me to my apartment.

34:08.964 --> 34:12.007
I shouldn't have gotten mad
in the elevator today.

34:12.092 --> 34:14.760
But when I want something that bad,
I get all fired up.

34:15.512 --> 34:18.973
Maybe that's why I worry so.
Maybe more than I should.

34:19.349 --> 34:22.268
Something terrible could happen.
You must...

34:23.728 --> 34:25.688
- But I...
- Don't worry.

34:26.815 --> 34:28.733
Everything will be fine. I promise.

34:29.400 --> 34:30.943
Boy, I hope so.

34:38.452 --> 34:40.077
Well, this is it.

34:42.164 --> 34:44.915
- It's a nice place.
- It's OK.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.877
The only problem is I have a nosy landlady.

34:50.755 --> 34:52.672
Well, I guess this is good night.

34:53.717 --> 34:55.342
I don't wanna go back.

34:56.844 --> 34:58.512
You don't have to.

34:58.847 --> 35:00.848
I don't want to be alone.

35:01.266 --> 35:04.727
And, by the way,
I can go all night like a lumberjack.

35:08.190 --> 35:09.982
What about your landlady?

35:10.066 --> 35:11.233
You can do her, too.

35:27.209 --> 35:30.169
So, I take it you've been with a man before.

35:31.546 --> 35:33.005
I'm a virgin.

35:33.799 --> 35:35.800
I'm just not very good at it.

35:37.260 --> 35:38.469
(gulps)

35:39.012 --> 35:41.222
("All by Myself" instrumental)

36:29.855 --> 36:31.355
(Ramada sighs)

36:35.443 --> 36:36.944
(Ramada moans with pleasure)

36:44.369 --> 36:45.452
Ooh!

36:58.174 --> 36:59.216
Ah!

37:08.852 --> 37:11.312
(sensually) Yes. Oh, yes...

37:14.316 --> 37:17.985
- (sizzling)
- (Ramada moans with pleasure)

37:27.287 --> 37:29.580
(Ramada) Ah! Topper...

37:42.344 --> 37:43.427
Oh...

37:51.186 --> 37:52.728
(reveille)

38:06.201 --> 38:07.493
Wash Out!

38:09.579 --> 38:12.289
Get into your flight suit.
We're ready to go up.

38:12.791 --> 38:16.210
I got kicked out.
My flight status has been withdrawn.

38:16.294 --> 38:17.378
I'm through, Dead Meat.

38:17.545 --> 38:21.465
- What happened?
- It's my eyes. I've got walleye vision.

38:24.678 --> 38:29.306
- Can't something be done?
- A delicate corneal inversion procedure.

38:29.391 --> 38:30.975
A multioptipupiloptomy.

38:31.059 --> 38:32.851
But, to keep from
damaging the eye sockets,

38:32.936 --> 38:34.395
they've gotta go in through the rectum.

38:36.106 --> 38:37.898
Ain't no man gonna take that route with me.

38:40.110 --> 38:41.735
Is Topper around? I'd like to say goodbye.

38:42.779 --> 38:47.866
He didn't come back last night. He's AWOL.
As soon as Block finds out, he's history.

38:48.034 --> 38:50.661
But flying's his life.
He's the best pilot in the world.

38:50.745 --> 38:52.830
We need him as much as he needs us.

38:52.914 --> 38:56.125
I can't find my lucky gum. Do you have...

38:56.584 --> 38:57.876
Wash Out?

39:11.725 --> 39:14.018
Oh, my God. I missed my flight.

39:15.061 --> 39:16.603
You're amazing.

39:19.899 --> 39:21.191
Dead Meat!

39:22.444 --> 39:26.447
Mary!

39:28.533 --> 39:31.368
- Come to watch me fly?
- No. There was a meltdown at the plant.

39:31.453 --> 39:33.454
- They gave me afternoon off.
- Terrific!

39:35.415 --> 39:39.877
Oh! Good news. We just closed escrow
on our little dream house.

39:39.961 --> 39:42.212
- Wonderful! When do we move in?
- Tuesday.

39:42.297 --> 39:45.049
The kids are stripping
the asbestos off the pipes now.

39:45.133 --> 39:48.385
That's great!
Things couldn't be better for us.

39:48.470 --> 39:49.970
I'm so blessed.

39:50.513 --> 39:53.807
Oh! Your life insurance forms
came for you to sign.

39:55.226 --> 39:57.603
- (mirror smashes)
- Oh, my mirror!

40:01.399 --> 40:02.483
Huh!

40:03.610 --> 40:07.571
- I'll get another pen.
- No need. I'll sign it when I get back.

40:07.655 --> 40:09.281
Well, you know best.

40:09.365 --> 40:13.660
Honey, you know that global-warming
problem? I know how we can reverse it.

40:13.745 --> 40:16.497
- Tell me.
- No, not now, lovey-bumpers.

40:16.581 --> 40:18.749
There'll be plenty of time for that later.

40:18.833 --> 40:21.710
And my investigation
into JFK's assassination?

40:21.961 --> 40:23.962
You found the evidence you wanted?

40:24.089 --> 40:28.175
Yes. It's right here in my pocket.
It's big, honey.

40:28.259 --> 40:29.843
It goes all the way to the White House.

40:30.011 --> 40:34.348
- Do you want me to hold it for you?
- Nah. It'll be safe right here.

40:34.432 --> 40:36.600
I'm in a jet. What could go wrong?

40:36.684 --> 40:41.188
Oh, Dead Meat. We just couldn't be
any more perfectly happy.

40:48.822 --> 40:50.823
Where the hell is Topper?

40:52.492 --> 40:53.951
Thanks for joinin' the party!

40:54.619 --> 40:58.330
Hey, Topper!
You seen any of my lucky gum?

40:58.414 --> 40:59.456
No.

41:01.459 --> 41:03.710
Freedom Squadron, start your engines.

41:05.922 --> 41:09.967
God, that's loud. My ear canals
are very sensitive. Stainless steel.

41:10.051 --> 41:13.887
Took a bullet in Corregidor.
Passed straight through. Look at this.

41:20.228 --> 41:21.311
Huh?

41:23.731 --> 41:25.524
We have these to hold down the sound, sir.

41:26.276 --> 41:27.901
Oh, good. Thanks.

41:31.739 --> 41:35.075
Let's hope they do the trick.
Give me the mike, boy.

41:35.618 --> 41:38.078
For the love of God, man, be careful!

41:38.163 --> 41:40.873
Ever since Normandy, this is CorningWare.

41:40.957 --> 41:45.627
Those of you who excel
during these aerial combat exercises

41:45.712 --> 41:50.174
will go on to make up
the greatest fighting unit ever assembled.

41:52.844 --> 41:56.180
- Topper, keep that nose up!
- He's never done that before.

41:56.264 --> 41:59.600
Red team leader, break off.
Prepare to engage.

41:59.893 --> 42:01.268
Roger that.

42:05.106 --> 42:07.524
- Blue leader, prepare for action.
- Roger that.

42:09.235 --> 42:10.611
(rock music)

42:15.992 --> 42:17.784
I'm minus six. Movin' in.

42:19.913 --> 42:22.456
I've got tone! Got him!

42:22.624 --> 42:24.708
Dead Meat, confirm kill.

42:32.759 --> 42:34.426
- Mrs Thompson?
- Yes.

42:34.510 --> 42:37.888
- I'm Topper Harley.
- Oh! Dead Meat's talked about you!

42:37.972 --> 42:40.474
Oh, he thinks the world of you!

42:40.558 --> 42:42.976
But... shouldn't you be
up there flying with the squad?

42:47.148 --> 42:49.816
I've got a lock. I'm closing in.

42:50.360 --> 42:53.570
- (goose) Uh-oh!
- He's spotted me! He's a slippery devil.

42:55.823 --> 42:58.116
Topper! Watch your right side! Damn!

42:58.201 --> 42:59.993
I'm bailin' out!

43:04.457 --> 43:07.084
Wash Out? What are you doin' here?

43:07.252 --> 43:08.877
There's no time to go into it.

43:09.170 --> 43:10.337
Uh-oh!

43:10.797 --> 43:12.839
(Wash Out) Do me a favour, don't land.

43:14.801 --> 43:18.011
- Get outta here! We're gonna crash!
- I can't! I'm stuck!

43:18.221 --> 43:20.889
Then I must help you, my friend!
Think well of me!

43:24.978 --> 43:27.020
(Wash Out) Thank youuuuu...

43:27.105 --> 43:30.190
- Don't. Don't look.
- Oh, no!

43:36.906 --> 43:38.031
Whoa!

43:50.920 --> 43:52.129
(siren)

43:53.131 --> 43:54.548
Oh, man!

43:54.674 --> 43:56.300
Wendy, I can fly!

44:02.765 --> 44:05.684
- (meekly) Hey, Topper.
- Easy, buddy.

44:08.187 --> 44:11.064
- The darnedest thing just happened.
- Hang on, buddy.

44:11.524 --> 44:12.899
Topper?

44:14.068 --> 44:16.194
Swing him around this way.

44:18.906 --> 44:20.782
Let's go. One, two...

44:22.577 --> 44:24.703
Let's move it. Come on!

44:24.787 --> 44:26.413
- Come on!
- Enough!

44:26.581 --> 44:27.831
(siren)

44:30.668 --> 44:31.835
Hello!

44:53.816 --> 44:56.902
- We'll have you in the hospital in no time.
- (Wash Out yells)

45:02.283 --> 45:04.451
Good morning! Excuse me!

45:05.495 --> 45:07.371
Wait, guys! Wait!

45:08.664 --> 45:10.499
Let's go, let's go.

45:10.583 --> 45:12.626
Easy. Easy, easy, easy.

45:13.753 --> 45:15.879
- Let's move.
- (Wash Out) What a ride!

45:16.839 --> 45:19.883
- Wash Out. You made it.
- Why, thank you, AndrÃ©.

45:19.967 --> 45:22.094
I'll have the veal piccata.

45:24.889 --> 45:27.099
- Oh. Get the cardio read-out.
- Where is it?

45:27.433 --> 45:30.894
- Um... It's, uh...
- Hey, fellas...

45:30.978 --> 45:33.397
- Inside there on the left.
- I can't find it!

45:36.109 --> 45:37.859
- Doctor!
- What happened?

45:37.944 --> 45:39.319
Plane crash.

45:41.155 --> 45:44.866
- We gotta work fast. I got a lunch.
- You're missing the big picture, Doc.

45:44.951 --> 45:46.993
Nurse, check his penis
isn't longer than mine.

45:47.078 --> 45:49.830
- No, Doctor.
- Good. Now this is gonna hurt.

45:49.914 --> 45:50.956
Ow!

45:51.249 --> 45:53.750
Nurse, give me 15cc of morphine, quickly!

45:53.835 --> 45:56.920
- Can you save him?
- Can't be sure. I'm not a good doctor.

45:57.004 --> 45:58.880
Thank you, Nurse. Wait here.

45:58.965 --> 46:02.259
- You gonna be all right, buddy?
- I'm in a hospital! What could go wrong?

46:03.678 --> 46:05.387
(church bell tolls)

46:12.186 --> 46:18.024
Mrs Thompson, I know you must hate me
but... there's something I want you to have.

46:18.276 --> 46:20.318
I've been puttin' a little away
for the past ten years.

46:20.403 --> 46:24.156
It's not much. 2500. I wish I could do more.

46:25.032 --> 46:26.450
Why, Topper.

46:27.618 --> 46:29.202
That's so sweet.

46:31.080 --> 46:35.000
Why, with the three million
I won on this lucky Lotto ticket,

46:35.084 --> 46:39.754
I can take this 2500
and just blow it all on hats.

46:44.594 --> 46:46.428
Right, and halt!

46:50.725 --> 46:52.058
(dog yelps)

46:57.440 --> 47:00.942
Pete "Dead Meat" Thompson... is dead.

47:01.652 --> 47:03.195
So is Mo Green,

47:03.905 --> 47:06.531
Tataglia, Barzini,

47:06.616 --> 47:09.117
the heads of all the five families.

47:10.077 --> 47:14.289
It is at moments like these, my dear friends
that we must ask ourselves,

47:14.373 --> 47:17.375
"How can this not be part
of some larger plan?"

47:17.460 --> 47:21.963
Do good men like Dead Meat Thompson
just blink out one day like a bad bulb?

47:22.256 --> 47:25.675
One minute you're in bed
with a knockout gal, or guy,

47:25.760 --> 47:27.636
and the next, you're a compost heap.

47:28.846 --> 47:32.390
Doesn't that bother you?
Because it scares the living piss outta me!

47:34.143 --> 47:36.895
(Block) I never thought this could happen.

47:36.979 --> 47:39.231
Don't we have what we need now,
Mr Wilson?

47:39.315 --> 47:41.858
This should be enough to prove
that our planes need replacing.

47:42.610 --> 47:47.656
No. They have to fail in combat for the world
to take notice. This is a minor incident.

47:48.282 --> 47:51.201
Minor? I just lost one of my best men!

47:52.787 --> 47:55.205
Are you backing out on us, Block?

47:55.414 --> 47:57.332
I'm doing this for my country,

47:57.416 --> 47:58.917
not for you.

48:04.048 --> 48:06.132
We'll need the backup plan.

48:06.551 --> 48:08.218
Ready... Fire!

48:09.303 --> 48:10.637
Jumpin' Jesus, they're back!

48:11.472 --> 48:14.266
- (gunfire)
- Take cover! Hit the deck!

48:17.103 --> 48:18.562
- Cover me!
- (gunfire)

48:18.646 --> 48:21.690
Battle stations! Battle stations!

48:24.819 --> 48:26.486
Have they no respect for the dead?

48:27.822 --> 48:29.322
(screaming)

48:34.412 --> 48:36.663
God, I love a good funeral.

48:55.641 --> 48:57.809
Topper, where are you going?

48:58.894 --> 49:01.146
I'm handin' in my resignation.

49:01.480 --> 49:03.481
You were right.
You said I was dangerous, and I am.

49:03.649 --> 49:04.941
Topper, wait.

49:05.735 --> 49:08.695
Please, let's talk. Huh?

49:11.532 --> 49:14.451
They're right. I'm no better than my father.

49:14.869 --> 49:18.913
It seems, no matter what I do,
I end up hurting someone.

49:20.374 --> 49:21.374
Ow!

49:23.544 --> 49:26.338
You've got to stop comparing yourself
with your father.

49:26.422 --> 49:28.381
You're two different people.

49:28.466 --> 49:31.468
- We both killed a man.
- That's just a coincidence.

49:31.552 --> 49:33.637
He loved jets. So do I.

49:33.721 --> 49:35.889
He was a loner, just like me.

49:35.973 --> 49:38.558
For God's sakes,
I've even got my father's eyes.

49:39.393 --> 49:43.063
- Topper, please!
- Ah, they're just for luck.

49:43.522 --> 49:45.607
You've got to make your own luck.

49:45.691 --> 49:48.443
Get back in the sky and prove yourself.

49:48.778 --> 49:50.779
Besides, there's something else.

49:52.406 --> 49:57.202
After our first meeting in my office,
I sent my evaluation to Commander Block.

49:57.787 --> 50:01.206
I recommended you be grounded.
I was afraid someone might get hurt.

50:01.499 --> 50:02.916
What are you saying?

50:04.335 --> 50:07.253
I think someone wants Sleepy Weasel
to fail.

50:08.422 --> 50:11.257
- That's heavy.
- Totally.

50:11.342 --> 50:13.843
That's the other reason why you need to fly.

50:13.928 --> 50:17.514
This could be your only opportunity
to save the mission

50:17.598 --> 50:21.434
and solve your personal problems,
all in one fell swoop.

50:34.073 --> 50:35.573
Now read it back to me, Francine.

50:36.992 --> 50:40.203
"And if you ever put your goddamn hands
on my wife again..."

50:40.287 --> 50:41.621
(knocking)

50:43.124 --> 50:46.042
- You wanted to see me, sir?
- Oh, Blank. Come in.

50:46.127 --> 50:47.794
I've been expecting someone.

50:47.878 --> 50:50.422
- That'll be all, Francine.
- Yes, sir.

50:54.635 --> 50:57.011
- Pudding?
- No, thank you, sir.

50:57.805 --> 51:01.558
I'll put this to you straight.
Thompson's death shocked us all.

51:01.642 --> 51:03.560
And that hot shot Harley is responsible.

51:03.644 --> 51:06.354
I want that smirking little wise-ass
outta here.

51:08.482 --> 51:12.986
Morale on this base is shot to hell.
Just look out there.

51:14.405 --> 51:17.323
Quiet. Now, hardly a man moving.

51:18.075 --> 51:20.201
Roy? Roy!

51:21.412 --> 51:25.331
Huh? I even went to school with that man.
It's just not the same.

51:25.666 --> 51:29.544
Been ignoring me all day.
Remind me to send him a note.

51:29.628 --> 51:31.045
Sir, may I say something?

51:32.840 --> 51:35.300
I know Harley acted irresponsibly.

51:35.509 --> 51:39.012
But his kind lives on the edge.
Always willing to take a chance.

51:39.680 --> 51:42.182
Now, we need Topper for this mission
for just that reason.

51:46.395 --> 51:48.396
I like your thinking, Colonel.

51:48.481 --> 51:51.024
Besides, Thompson wasn't that good a pilot.

51:51.108 --> 51:56.070
He only had a small family. The kids are
a pain in the ass. The wife's on the sauce.

51:56.155 --> 51:58.448
Poor bastard's better off dead.

51:59.116 --> 52:00.408
What size shoes do you wear?

52:01.535 --> 52:03.828
- A nine, sir.
- Good.

52:04.205 --> 52:06.414
It's settled. We'll send Harley to the front.

52:06.499 --> 52:10.460
By the way. Thank you for having us
over to dinner the other night.

52:10.544 --> 52:13.004
Cheryl and I loved the stroganoff.

52:13.339 --> 52:16.508
- Sir, we didn't have dinner the other night.
- Really?

52:17.384 --> 52:20.512
Well, where the hell was I?
And who's this Cheryl?

52:20.971 --> 52:22.680
Ah, doesn't matter.

52:22.848 --> 52:24.390
Run along, Sid.

52:27.186 --> 52:28.394
Cheryl?

52:33.692 --> 52:34.776
Kent?

52:39.031 --> 52:43.618
I came to get my chafing dish. Our orders
just came. We're shipping out in one hour.

52:43.702 --> 52:45.912
Are you comin' along this time?

52:45.996 --> 52:47.997
- The chafing dish is not yours.
- It is.

52:48.082 --> 52:50.208
- It isn't.
- OK, I don't want it.

52:50.292 --> 52:51.709
- I'll take it.
- You stay out of it.

52:52.461 --> 52:54.462
This is not the time or place.

52:54.547 --> 52:57.799
I've got a big score
to settle with you, my friend.

52:58.551 --> 52:59.634
Excuse me.

53:04.765 --> 53:06.266
I've hurt him.

53:07.101 --> 53:08.351
Topper...

53:09.019 --> 53:11.729
Topper, you better go. I have to think.

53:12.481 --> 53:13.982
Well, I don't.

53:14.608 --> 53:18.361
- I've fallen for you like a blind roofer.
- I'm sorry?

53:19.154 --> 53:23.283
My heart is fallin' down around my ankles
like a wet pair of pants.

53:25.160 --> 53:27.912
My whole life, all I've wanted to do is fly.

53:27.997 --> 53:30.123
Bomb stuff. Shoot people down.

53:30.958 --> 53:35.044
But we've been through so much together.
Ramada, I need you.

53:35.129 --> 53:36.129
I want you.

53:37.548 --> 53:42.093
Only you

53:42.177 --> 53:47.807
Can make this world seem bright

53:47.892 --> 53:52.604
Only you

53:52.688 --> 53:56.983
Can make the darkness bright

53:57.234 --> 53:58.318
Wow!

53:58.611 --> 54:03.990
Only you, and you alone

54:04.533 --> 54:09.913
Can thrill me like you do

54:09.997 --> 54:16.920
And fill my heart with love for only you

54:17.171 --> 54:19.422
Wah, wah, wah, wah

54:19.506 --> 54:20.924
Ramada!

54:21.342 --> 54:22.550
Topper!

54:24.386 --> 54:25.929
Ramada!

54:28.682 --> 54:30.058
I love you!

54:30.809 --> 54:32.185
I love you.

54:34.939 --> 54:37.941
You are my destiny

54:38.025 --> 54:40.151
It's not that easy, Ramada.

54:43.030 --> 54:45.198
This is one night you're not turning me out.

54:46.867 --> 54:50.954
The magic that you do

54:51.038 --> 54:54.374
You're my dream come true

54:54.458 --> 55:00.463
My one and only you

55:00.965 --> 55:05.802
Oh-oh, only you

55:05.886 --> 55:10.974
Can make this change in me

55:11.266 --> 55:15.228
For it's true

55:15.604 --> 55:19.816
You are my destiny

55:19.900 --> 55:21.275
(cooing)

55:21.360 --> 55:24.654
When you hold my hand

55:24.738 --> 55:27.198
I understand

55:27.282 --> 55:31.035
The magic that you do

55:31.120 --> 55:34.580
You're my dream come true

55:34.665 --> 55:36.165
My one

55:38.627 --> 55:42.255
And only

55:42.339 --> 55:46.134
You

55:47.344 --> 55:50.263
Topper, I'm so confused. I need time alone.

56:18.125 --> 56:19.625
Admiral Benson!

56:20.169 --> 56:22.628
Really? That's my name, too.

56:24.131 --> 56:29.844
Yankee Doodle Floppy Disk, this is Foxtrot
Zulu Milkshake. Request permission to land.

56:29.928 --> 56:34.182
Roger that. You are cleared to land.
Welcome to the Mediterranean.

56:34.266 --> 56:35.767
Wash Out, is that you?

56:36.643 --> 56:40.772
You bet! They put me in charge of radar.
I'm your eyes on the ground.

56:42.608 --> 56:47.111
All crews report to the flight deck.
All crews report to the flight deck.

57:27.027 --> 57:28.611
Have you no decency?

57:40.082 --> 57:41.707
Ah! The open sea.

57:43.252 --> 57:46.796
Oh, God. I wish I could smell.
I had my nostrils fried in Panmunjom.

57:47.714 --> 57:48.881
Admiral Benson!

57:50.175 --> 57:53.636
Meet Mr Wilson and Mr Rosener
of Rockman Aviation.

57:53.720 --> 57:55.429
They'll be observing the operation.

57:55.514 --> 57:56.597
Yes, of course.

57:58.142 --> 58:00.226
It's OK. I'm all right. No problem.

58:01.436 --> 58:04.856
I slipped on the crab.
Who put that crab there?

58:04.940 --> 58:09.026
- Crab? I didn't see any crab.
- There were two crabs. They work in pairs.

58:09.361 --> 58:11.362
I went to Annapolis, for Christ's sake.

58:11.446 --> 58:16.325
- From the Pentagon, sir. We just decoded it.
- Help me with this. My eyes are ceramic.

58:16.410 --> 58:21.080
A bazooka round at Little Bighorn. Or was it
Okinawa? The one without the Indians.

58:21.165 --> 58:24.000
It's final orders.
We strike tomorrow at 0600.

58:24.084 --> 58:27.086
Excellent. Wake me up at, oh... 5.30.

58:53.655 --> 58:55.156
(cock crows)

59:01.163 --> 59:04.832
- Get outta your flight suit. You're not going.
- What do you mean?

59:04.917 --> 59:08.669
This mission is too important
to let you screw it up. You're not flying.

59:08.962 --> 59:10.504
- Am too.
- Are not.

59:10.631 --> 59:14.592
- Am too.
- (men) Oooh!

59:14.676 --> 59:16.886
- All right, mister. Let's go at it.
- Let's do it.

59:17.846 --> 59:19.305
Come on, come on.

59:19.389 --> 59:21.057
(men shout encouragement)

59:21.141 --> 59:22.808
(muffled shouting)

59:32.819 --> 59:34.195
(men) Whoa!

59:34.821 --> 59:36.989
- My face!
- My hand!

59:38.450 --> 59:39.867
Attention on deck!

59:41.536 --> 59:42.870
Be seated.

59:47.292 --> 59:49.585
Gentlemen, we've waited
a long time to hear this.

59:49.670 --> 59:53.798
In exactly five hours and 17 minutes,
we hit the enemy toast.

59:54.299 --> 59:58.177
- I think that's the enemy coast, sir.
- Huh? Coast?

01:00:00.013 --> 01:00:01.889
That'll take a little more planning.

01:00:01.974 --> 01:00:05.685
We have to knock out the nuclear-weapons
plant at Falafel Heights.

01:00:05.769 --> 01:00:08.479
The plant goes on line in 12 hours
and is heavily defended.

01:00:09.731 --> 01:00:15.278
If you have trouble hitting your objective,
your secondary targets are here and here:

01:00:15.362 --> 01:00:18.030
An accordion factory and a mime school.

01:00:18.991 --> 01:00:21.701
Good luck, gentlemen. Blink, take over.

01:00:24.037 --> 01:00:25.788
- Oh, one more thing.
- (clang)

01:00:25.872 --> 01:00:28.374
I'll get that. It's probably for me.

01:00:33.297 --> 01:00:35.798
Our sortie will proceed as planned.

01:00:36.383 --> 01:00:38.884
And I want Topper Harley
leading our squadron into battle.

01:00:42.347 --> 01:00:43.764
Lieutenant Commander, sir.

01:00:44.433 --> 01:00:47.977
It's nothing personal.
I know I speak for every man here.

01:00:48.061 --> 01:00:50.146
We've lost all respect for Harley.

01:00:50.230 --> 01:00:52.398
He's poison for the morale of the unit,

01:00:52.482 --> 01:00:54.775
and a disaster
to the success of this mission.

01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:58.529
You're outta line, Gregory.
You'll obey orders and like it.

01:01:00.282 --> 01:01:01.741
Now get to your planes.

01:01:13.211 --> 01:01:16.088
- Sir?
- What is it, Mr Harley?

01:01:17.382 --> 01:01:20.009
- I hope I'm wrong about this.
- What would that be?

01:01:20.302 --> 01:01:23.304
Nobody likes playing
for a coach who throws the big game.

01:01:24.556 --> 01:01:25.765
What's that supposed to mean?

01:01:26.808 --> 01:01:30.311
My uncle told me that not playin' to win
is like sleepin' with your sister.

01:01:30.937 --> 01:01:34.815
Sure, she's a great piece of tail
with a blouseful of goodies, but it's illegal.

01:01:35.442 --> 01:01:39.320
- Jesus, Topper. Come on.
- Then you get into that whole inbred thing.

01:01:39.404 --> 01:01:41.489
Kids with no teeth who play the banjo,

01:01:41.573 --> 01:01:44.116
eat apple sauce through a straw,
pork farm animals.

01:01:44.701 --> 01:01:45.951
Topper, that's enough.

01:01:47.454 --> 01:01:49.663
I think you get my point, sir.

01:01:49.790 --> 01:01:51.540
I just hope you're playin' straight with us.

01:02:16.942 --> 01:02:18.484
(dog yelps)

01:02:27.953 --> 01:02:31.497
Alpha Velveeta Knuckle Underwear,
you are cleared for takeoff.

01:02:32.124 --> 01:02:36.043
When you hit that nuclear-weapons plant,
drop a bomb for me.

01:02:36.128 --> 01:02:38.963
Sphincter Mucous Niner Ringworm, roger.

01:02:40.006 --> 01:02:41.382
(rock music)

01:03:05.699 --> 01:03:06.907
OlÃ©!

01:03:24.092 --> 01:03:25.468
Yieeee!

01:03:36.396 --> 01:03:40.941
Holy cow! My cap blew off!
Swing her round. We'll pick it up.

01:03:41.026 --> 01:03:43.319
But, sir, we're on the mission.

01:03:44.446 --> 01:03:47.573
Good thinking.
We'll pick it up on the way back.

01:03:48.158 --> 01:03:51.410
We gotta mark the spot, though.
Put Rabinowitz in a life raft.

01:03:51.495 --> 01:03:55.164
- Have him row in circles until we return.
- It could be days.

01:03:55.916 --> 01:04:00.503
Then put some food in the life raft, man.
Do I have to think of everything?

01:04:00.587 --> 01:04:02.963
We'll tape his favourite shows.

01:04:03.256 --> 01:04:06.133
- Sir, there's no time.
- OK, OK!

01:04:06.218 --> 01:04:08.344
How can I be an admiral without my cap?

01:04:08.428 --> 01:04:12.181
It's out there all alone
and I'm powerless to do anything about it.

01:04:12.807 --> 01:04:14.975
(Block) We're entering enemy airspace.

01:04:18.897 --> 01:04:21.857
Sir, it appears we have
unidentified radar contacts.

01:04:21.942 --> 01:04:28.614
- Looks like enemy aircraft at 12 o'clock.
- Really? That gives us about... 25 minutes.

01:04:28.698 --> 01:04:30.241
Think I'll step out for a burger.

01:04:37.165 --> 01:04:42.127
Sir, there are six of them!
Bearing 2-1-5, range 150 mi...

01:04:45.131 --> 01:04:47.258
Oh my God, a dozen more of them.

01:04:47.342 --> 01:04:52.137
And a blimp! A big, shiny blimp,
and it's slowly moving south!

01:04:52.847 --> 01:04:57.059
- Block, have you got a tally on the bandits?
- Roger that. I got 'em.

01:04:57.143 --> 01:05:01.313
All right. Resume combat spread.
Attack formation Delta-niner.

01:05:01.690 --> 01:05:04.984
Topper in the lead.
Just like your old man, son.

01:05:06.111 --> 01:05:09.154
Old Buzz Harley'd be proud of you, Topper.

01:05:11.074 --> 01:05:13.284
(Kent) He's the type that could end up
killing every man in this outfit.

01:05:13.368 --> 01:05:15.035
He's poison for morale of the unit.

01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:17.496
(George Bush) Read... my... lips.

01:05:17.581 --> 01:05:21.417
- No... new... taxes.
- (crowd cheers)

01:05:22.127 --> 01:05:25.379
- Topper, what are you doing?
- He's frozen! Topper's no good to us!

01:05:26.715 --> 01:05:29.633
Abort the mission! Abort the mission!

01:05:29.718 --> 01:05:31.510
Return to mother!

01:05:36.349 --> 01:05:37.975
We can't! They're all over us!

01:05:39.185 --> 01:05:48.819
(pseudo-Arabic)

01:05:48.987 --> 01:05:52.781
- Damn it! All right, engage!
- I've got a bogie at 12 o'clock!

01:05:55.368 --> 01:05:56.535
(pseudo-Arabic)

01:05:57.287 --> 01:06:00.581
I got two on my tail!
Kowalski, get 'em off me.

01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:05.210
Locked up! Fox two!

01:06:05.879 --> 01:06:06.962
(pseudo-Arabic)

01:06:09.466 --> 01:06:11.300
(Kowalski) My missile didn't track!

01:06:11.384 --> 01:06:13.802
(Kent) My engine's cut out.
I'm losing power.

01:06:15.722 --> 01:06:18.390
(Topper) My cannons won't fire!
What's going on?

01:06:20.101 --> 01:06:21.602
I've got two bandits on my six!

01:06:27.067 --> 01:06:29.943
This is insane. Wilson and Rosener.

01:06:30.779 --> 01:06:34.323
It was them, wasn't it?
They said nobody was gonna get hurt!

01:06:34.407 --> 01:06:36.575
Block, call your men back.

01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:41.205
Like hell I will! I got
the best pilot in the world up here.

01:06:41.373 --> 01:06:43.707
Topper! Topper, do you read me?

01:06:43.792 --> 01:06:48.921
I was there 20 years ago. I was there
with your father and Mailman Farnham.

01:06:49.130 --> 01:06:52.716
I was an eyewitness.
You gotta listen to me, Topper.

01:06:52.801 --> 01:06:54.843
What they said about your dad is wrong.

01:06:54.928 --> 01:06:56.804
Eject, Mailman. Eject!

01:06:58.431 --> 01:07:00.391
I can't! My seat's jammed!

01:07:00.475 --> 01:07:02.559
- Nothing works!
- Stay calm!

01:07:02.644 --> 01:07:05.813
- My harness is malfunctioning!
- I'll get it!

01:07:07.357 --> 01:07:10.109
Buzz! The nose! The nose!

01:07:10.944 --> 01:07:13.696
Whoa! Sit tight!

01:07:15.448 --> 01:07:17.783
Whoa... Whoa!

01:07:17.867 --> 01:07:20.494
Come on! Hurry!

01:07:24.290 --> 01:07:25.916
Get the lead out!

01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:28.961
(Buzz) It's gonna be OK!

01:07:31.464 --> 01:07:33.632
Wow! That was sure close!

01:07:34.801 --> 01:07:37.428
Buzz! Get back here!

01:07:39.681 --> 01:07:41.098
Whoaaa!

01:07:41.933 --> 01:07:43.142
Argh!

01:07:44.477 --> 01:07:46.145
(falsetto) I'm OK!

01:07:47.939 --> 01:07:50.899
Buzz! The wing! The wing!

01:07:50.984 --> 01:07:52.234
Hurry!

01:07:54.821 --> 01:07:56.864
What, are you on a break?

01:07:57.532 --> 01:08:01.326
- Hurry!
- I'm here!

01:08:02.746 --> 01:08:04.830
Hey, whose gum is this? Whoa!

01:08:04.914 --> 01:08:07.541
Oh, for God's sake! Not now!

01:08:12.213 --> 01:08:15.424
Got it! Hold on! We'll bring this baby down!

01:08:15.508 --> 01:08:17.050
Stop squirming!

01:08:17.676 --> 01:08:18.886
Hang on!

01:08:20.013 --> 01:08:22.848
- Whoa!
- Those are my socks!

01:08:23.725 --> 01:08:25.768
Buzz! Get back here!

01:08:26.269 --> 01:08:30.147
(Block) Your father did everything
possible to save Mailman's life.

01:08:30.231 --> 01:08:34.693
You should be proud, son.
Buzz Harley is a true American hero.

01:08:39.032 --> 01:08:41.742
- I'm hit! I'm hit!
- Block, are you all right?

01:08:41.826 --> 01:08:43.410
Yes! Yes!

01:08:43.953 --> 01:08:45.703
Give 'em hell!

01:08:46.038 --> 01:08:48.247
Got it! This is for you, Dad.

01:08:52.086 --> 01:08:54.004
- They're on my tail.
- I'm with you, buddy.

01:08:56.381 --> 01:08:57.925
Hang in there.

01:09:01.513 --> 01:09:03.388
My guns are jammed.

01:09:03.515 --> 01:09:05.182
- (beeping)
- They got tone on me!

01:09:06.475 --> 01:09:08.185
I'm gonna have to do it the hard way.

01:09:11.064 --> 01:09:12.272
Anybody home?

01:09:14.609 --> 01:09:15.984
They fell for that one.

01:09:17.111 --> 01:09:20.238
- Topper! Three bandits, 12 o'clock!
- I'm on 'em!

01:09:24.452 --> 01:09:26.078
Here we go, loop de loop.

01:09:26.246 --> 01:09:28.372
- Couscous!
- (pseudo-Arabic)

01:09:31.292 --> 01:09:33.961
Learned this one from Paula Abdul.

01:09:42.136 --> 01:09:43.428
Oldest trick in the book.

01:09:50.270 --> 01:09:53.689
Catch me if you can, guys.
Here's an old Buzz Harley move.

01:09:57.026 --> 01:09:59.319
- Oh, boys...
- Agh!

01:10:01.072 --> 01:10:03.657
I'm on their tails. I've got 'em now.

01:10:08.955 --> 01:10:10.372
Hey, buddy.

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:12.457
(pseudo-Arabic)

01:10:16.296 --> 01:10:17.546
It looks like they're buggin' out.

01:10:20.341 --> 01:10:21.633
Yikes!

01:10:21.926 --> 01:10:23.802
(squeal of brakes)

01:10:29.851 --> 01:10:32.811
Saved by the clouds. Come on in, boys.

01:10:32.896 --> 01:10:34.396
(pseudo-Arabic)

01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:36.481
A little hide-and-seek.

01:10:37.066 --> 01:10:38.650
(pseudo-Arabic)

01:10:43.281 --> 01:10:44.698
See ya later, guys.

01:10:46.576 --> 01:10:49.661
This could be the end
of a beautiful friendship.

01:10:53.458 --> 01:10:55.667
(Kent) Topper, look out!

01:10:56.669 --> 01:10:58.837
I got two heat-seeking missiles on my tail.

01:11:00.465 --> 01:11:03.383
Block, Kent, Kowalski,
get the hell outta here.

01:11:03.885 --> 01:11:07.846
Get back to the ship!
I got me a nuclear-weapons plant to wax.

01:11:08.181 --> 01:11:10.682
- You're committing suicide!
- Do as he says!

01:11:14.062 --> 01:11:16.521
- (squeal of brakes)
- We are getting close.

01:11:17.273 --> 01:11:19.858
Missiles? Still with me. Come on.

01:11:26.407 --> 01:11:28.367
If I can't lose 'em, I'll use 'em.

01:11:30.536 --> 01:11:32.079
The mother of all targets.

01:11:35.750 --> 01:11:37.376
Sayonara, Saddam.

01:11:42.882 --> 01:11:46.301
(Block) Come in! Are you all right?
Topper, acknowledge!

01:11:46.636 --> 01:11:48.887
- Topper, do you read?
- Topper, are you all right?

01:12:00.775 --> 01:12:01.900
There they are!

01:12:06.447 --> 01:12:08.991
(Kent) Uh, we're landing. Get out of the way.

01:12:11.411 --> 01:12:13.328
Run for your lives!

01:12:20.586 --> 01:12:22.587
(cheering and whistling)

01:12:25.967 --> 01:12:27.801
- Where's Topper?
- Lost contact.

01:12:34.934 --> 01:12:37.936
- There he is!
- (Topper) Pyrex Pickle Blowfish.

01:12:38.021 --> 01:12:41.231
- Permission to land.
- (cheering)

01:12:42.275 --> 01:12:44.359
You'll have to talk me down.
I've got damage.

01:12:44.444 --> 01:12:46.111
Hold it, hold it!

01:12:46.195 --> 01:12:48.321
OK, Topper. Ease her in.

01:12:48.406 --> 01:12:50.449
- Landing gear's frozen.
- Lookin' good.

01:12:50.533 --> 01:12:53.910
- Lost my radar.
- A little more power now.

01:12:53.995 --> 01:12:56.246
- I'm out of fuel.
- Right for lineup.

01:12:56.330 --> 01:12:58.790
- Lost a wing.
- Doin' fine.

01:12:58.875 --> 01:13:02.377
- There goes the other one.
- OK, Topper. Call the ball.

01:13:02.462 --> 01:13:04.212
Touchin' down.

01:13:05.256 --> 01:13:06.631
(huge cheer)

01:13:09.927 --> 01:13:11.970
Wha-hoo!

01:13:16.142 --> 01:13:17.684
Well done, Jim!

01:13:25.568 --> 01:13:28.236
- You're quite a guy!
- So are you!

01:13:29.655 --> 01:13:30.989
Hey! Wash Out!

01:13:32.325 --> 01:13:33.992
Oh, Topper...

01:13:38.247 --> 01:13:41.374
You.

01:13:47.048 --> 01:13:49.299
- I got one question for you.
- Shoot.

01:13:49.842 --> 01:13:51.635
What is a chafing dish for?

01:13:51.719 --> 01:13:56.056
Why, it's a traditional serving piece
used at brunches to keep food warm.

01:13:56.140 --> 01:13:59.643
- I thought that was a Crockpot.
- No, no, no.

01:13:59.727 --> 01:14:02.604
That's for cooking all day. A chafing dish...

01:14:09.112 --> 01:14:13.615
(reporter) Hey, Topper! Now that you've
made the world safe for democracy,

01:14:13.699 --> 01:14:16.326
what will you do
to cash in on your new-found fame?

01:14:16.410 --> 01:14:18.411
- I'm goin' to Disneyland!
- (cheering)

01:14:24.710 --> 01:14:28.338
You're very fortunate, Commander Block.
This man has your blood type.

01:14:28.965 --> 01:14:32.759
Don't worry, sir. After this transfusion,
you're gonna be just fine.

01:14:33.386 --> 01:14:36.805
I've only seen heroism like that
one other time.

01:14:36.889 --> 01:14:40.308
Maybe you know the pilot:
Leland "Buzz" Harley.

01:14:42.186 --> 01:14:45.438
I've been carrying this secret around
for 20 years.

01:14:45.690 --> 01:14:47.315
I never spoke up.

01:14:48.317 --> 01:14:50.110
I wanted him to fail.

01:14:50.528 --> 01:14:52.571
I wanted to be number one.

01:14:53.573 --> 01:14:55.073
And I was in love with your mother.

01:14:56.409 --> 01:15:00.871
It's not important now, sir. Please,
save your strength for your court martial.

01:15:00.997 --> 01:15:03.999
Topper, you had me pegged right.

01:15:04.083 --> 01:15:05.834
I was throwin' the big game.

01:15:05.918 --> 01:15:06.960
Oh!

01:15:09.213 --> 01:15:11.590
I really thought
we needed that other airplane.

01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:16.970
But now I realise that
American planes'll always be superior

01:15:17.054 --> 01:15:20.307
as long as there are
wonderful men like you in the cockpit

01:15:20.391 --> 01:15:22.017
and German parts.

01:15:22.476 --> 01:15:27.189
I know you think it was me, but it was
Wilson and Rosener who sabotaged the jets.

01:15:27.481 --> 01:15:30.192
They played me like a two-bit piccolo.

01:15:30.276 --> 01:15:33.737
(laughs) Oh! Oh...

01:15:42.788 --> 01:15:44.164
Whoaaaaa!

01:15:44.582 --> 01:15:47.667
I can see my house from here!

01:15:47.877 --> 01:15:49.127
(splash)

01:15:50.963 --> 01:15:52.756
Oh no, you don't.

01:15:55.092 --> 01:15:57.344
- Admiral!
- You call yourself an American?

01:15:57.428 --> 01:16:02.057
That gets my panties in a bunch.
It's scum like you that taint our military.

01:16:02.141 --> 01:16:06.978
- You don't know what you're talking about.
- You risked the lives of some fine pilots.

01:16:08.814 --> 01:16:10.190
Well, that's my job.

01:16:17.073 --> 01:16:18.573
Is it safe?

01:16:20.534 --> 01:16:22.077
- (starts drill)
- (screams in agony)

01:16:31.462 --> 01:16:33.713
You look good up there, son.

(ship's horn)

01:16:59.407 --> 01:17:01.700
I think I'm wearing your pants.

01:17:18.175 --> 01:17:20.719
- Ramada!
- Kent!

01:17:29.395 --> 01:17:31.730
- You're OK.
- Ramada.

01:17:32.565 --> 01:17:34.649
You must put me out of your mind.

01:17:34.734 --> 01:17:39.237
There's a certain flyboy aboard that ship
that needs you far more than I.

01:17:39.655 --> 01:17:42.574
- You must forget me.
- No problem. I will.

01:17:42.658 --> 01:17:44.826
Please... Not a tear.

01:17:45.995 --> 01:17:49.039
Don't look back. That's my brave girl.

01:17:52.251 --> 01:17:56.171
Don't worry, little one!
As long as I have me, I'll survive!

01:17:58.132 --> 01:17:59.758
