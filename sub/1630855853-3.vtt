<i>- [mysterious score]
- My name is Kit Rampart.</i>

00:11.678 --> 00:13.678
You’re threatened.
You feel more like

00:13.805 --> 00:15.595
Kit the Spirit Stalker
than you want to admit.

00:15.724 --> 00:17.564
Worst part
is the silence.

00:17.684 --> 00:19.774
Tell me about it.
Tempting offer.

00:19.895 --> 00:21.985
[Zooey] Nah.
I have a feeling

00:22.105 --> 00:23.605
this real estate thing’s
gonna work out.

00:25.234 --> 00:26.944
<i>I found a beautiful house
that brings it all back.</i>

00:27.069 --> 00:29.279
Susan, you took what we do
and you color-coded it.

00:29.404 --> 00:30.864
There’s nothing magical
about your process.

00:30.989 --> 00:32.489
I’ll take it from here.

00:32.616 --> 00:34.576
What are you going to do?
Rat me out to Zooey again?

00:34.701 --> 00:36.951
You were a condescending,
dismissive jerk.

00:37.079 --> 00:40.119
[Susan] The new Luke
seems defensive, territorial.

00:40.249 --> 00:41.749
But on issues like this,
you need to

00:41.875 --> 00:43.455
check in with me
on everything.

00:43.585 --> 00:46.045
You might want to think about
doing things our way.

00:48.966 --> 00:50.506
I love this property.

00:50.634 --> 00:52.684
I mean, I love all my listings
but this one is--

00:52.803 --> 00:54.263
It’s special.

00:54.388 --> 00:55.968
[Tolliver] It is that.

00:56.098 --> 00:58.058
Don’t get me wrong,
we love working with you

00:58.183 --> 01:00.273
and I am certain
we will find you a buyer.

01:00.394 --> 01:01.984
I hope so.

01:02.104 --> 01:04.774
But I have to ask:
Why are you selling?

01:04.898 --> 01:06.648
You’ve only been here
less than a year.

01:07.776 --> 01:09.436
I assume you own a home.

01:09.570 --> 01:11.650
Yeah. A brand new one.

01:11.780 --> 01:13.240
Well, new to me.

01:13.365 --> 01:14.825
And you love it,
don’t you?

01:14.950 --> 01:16.410
Mm-hm.

01:16.535 --> 01:18.375
Well, you’re lucky.

01:18.495 --> 01:20.155
This place and I never...

01:21.999 --> 01:23.829
never quite...
[sighs]

01:24.459 --> 01:25.999
connected.

01:28.589 --> 01:30.339
Oh, I better
make myself scarce.

01:30.465 --> 01:32.005
Oh, you don’t have to--

01:32.634 --> 01:34.094
Mm-hm.

01:34.219 --> 01:35.759
[car door opens]

01:38.640 --> 01:41.680
You must be Emmett and Mandy!
I’m Susan.

01:41.810 --> 01:44.020
Hi. What a lovely place.

01:44.146 --> 01:45.606
Oh, you are in
for a treat!

01:45.731 --> 01:47.771
It’s not often we come across
a heritage property

01:47.899 --> 01:50.069
that has been
so gracefully modernized.

01:50.527 --> 01:52.027
Well, our place
is so small.

01:52.154 --> 01:53.864
Imagine having room to breathe!

01:54.364 --> 01:56.454
To stretch out!
To entertain!

01:57.159 --> 02:00.039
Just wait until you see
the updated gourmet kitchen.

02:00.787 --> 02:02.247
We could finally do
Thanksgiving dinner

02:02.372 --> 02:04.042
at our place.

02:05.751 --> 02:07.291
Get ready
to fall in love.

02:12.507 --> 02:14.717
How’s this for
a first impression?

02:15.469 --> 02:17.759
Imagine hosting
family celebrations here,

02:18.263 --> 02:21.103
holidays, or just
having friends drop in.

02:21.224 --> 02:23.274

02:48.335 --> 02:51.055
She never pulled that stunt
with anyone else before.

02:52.381 --> 02:53.921
Just me.

02:54.925 --> 02:57.095
I don’t suppose they’ll be
putting in an offer.

02:57.636 --> 03:00.046
Oh, I don’t think so, no.

03:00.180 --> 03:03.430
I heard that the Roman Agency
specialized in...

03:04.059 --> 03:05.519
stuff like this.

03:05.644 --> 03:08.194
We do. Um...
[clears throat]

03:08.313 --> 03:10.063
It is nice to have a little...

03:10.190 --> 03:12.940
heads up before we start
bringing people through.

03:13.694 --> 03:16.494
Of course. I’m sorry.
[sighs]

03:16.613 --> 03:19.203
Like I say, it’s the first time
it’s happened to anyone but me.

03:20.117 --> 03:21.577
Do you think
you can help?

03:21.702 --> 03:23.162
We can try.

03:23.286 --> 03:25.036
I’ll talk to my people
and get back to you.

03:27.416 --> 03:28.956
Any idea
who she might be?

03:30.919 --> 03:32.459
It’s an old house.

03:33.380 --> 03:35.010
Probably someone
who once lived here.

03:36.758 --> 03:38.298
Right up until she didn’t.

03:43.557 --> 03:45.097
[deep sigh]

03:46.184 --> 03:48.144
The house was built in 1934;

03:48.270 --> 03:50.190
only four owners
prior to Tolliver.

03:50.313 --> 03:52.573
Who goes through all the
trouble of planning a wedding

03:52.691 --> 03:54.401
just to pull the plug
on the day?

03:54.943 --> 03:57.403
I’d be more prone to self-harm
at the actual proposal.

03:57.529 --> 03:59.779
Drew is such a nice man.

03:59.906 --> 04:01.446
Imagine moving into a house
you thought you loved

04:01.575 --> 04:03.125
and having to deal with that.

04:04.327 --> 04:06.037
Do we have any way
to reach out to her?

04:09.499 --> 04:11.039
In fact, I do.

04:12.753 --> 04:14.303
Something new.

04:14.796 --> 04:16.706
Well, let’s take it for a spin.

04:24.014 --> 04:25.474
[knocking on door]

04:25.599 --> 04:27.559
Nice place.
What’s the square footage?

04:27.684 --> 04:29.234
Just under 7,000.

04:30.270 --> 04:31.810
Bedrooms?

04:32.230 --> 04:33.900
Four. I emailed you
all of this.

04:34.024 --> 04:35.534
Must have missed it.

04:35.650 --> 04:37.570
Well, you need to organize
your inbox folders.

04:37.694 --> 04:39.494
I’ll get right on that.

04:40.322 --> 04:42.452
Where is Mr Tolliver?
He said he’d be here.

04:42.574 --> 04:44.454
You have the code
for the lockbox, don’t you?

04:45.327 --> 04:46.867
[tense score]

04:49.372 --> 04:50.922
Mr. Tolliver?

04:52.083 --> 04:54.093
Mr. Tolliver,
it’s Susan Ireland.

04:56.797 --> 04:59.007
I guess this is where
she generally hangs.

05:01.718 --> 05:03.258
I’m going to
check the kitchen.

05:03.929 --> 05:07.969
Go ahead. I’ll check out, uh,
August’s walkie-talkie.

05:17.484 --> 05:19.034
[dramatic boom]

05:20.779 --> 05:22.319
[approaching footsteps]

05:27.410 --> 05:29.080
Must’ve stepped out.

05:29.871 --> 05:32.791
Why do all of August’s machines
look like what people in 1953

05:32.916 --> 05:35.246
thought machines in 1997
would look like?

05:35.377 --> 05:37.207
Well, he explained it
to me once.

05:37.921 --> 05:40.261
Apparently the other side
is way more sensitive

05:40.382 --> 05:42.342
to the analog stuff
than the digital.

05:42.843 --> 05:44.343
But you don’t need
to understand it.

05:44.469 --> 05:46.009
- [static]
- Just do it.

05:50.350 --> 05:51.930

Hello.

05:53.728 --> 05:55.688
- [unintelligible voices]
- Hello?

05:57.023 --> 05:58.693
Hello?

05:59.234 --> 06:00.784
Something happened.

06:03.613 --> 06:05.163
[gasp]

06:09.703 --> 06:11.543
Murdered.

06:11.663 --> 06:13.213
Did you hear that?

06:20.255 --> 06:22.175
- Oh.
- What did she say?

06:23.174 --> 06:25.344
[screaming]

06:26.511 --> 06:28.601
Murdered!

06:30.891 --> 06:33.021
But you hanged yourself.

06:33.143 --> 06:36.983
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no. Murdered!

06:37.105 --> 06:38.645
What is keeping you here?

06:39.733 --> 06:41.823
What do you want
and what do you need?

06:42.360 --> 06:44.320
- [static]
- [garbled voices]

06:48.909 --> 06:50.449
I...

06:51.077 --> 06:53.957
have the man.

06:56.499 --> 06:58.039
You have the man?

06:58.793 --> 07:00.343
What man?

07:00.795 --> 07:02.375
T-T-T-T...

07:03.381 --> 07:05.051
olliver!

07:05.926 --> 07:07.466
Where is Mr. Tolliver?

07:08.595 --> 07:12.275
He was m-m-mine.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.227
Find...

07:15.352 --> 07:18.022
murdered... me.

07:18.939 --> 07:20.519
You don’t know
who killed you?

07:20.649 --> 07:23.649
I... murdered...

07:23.777 --> 07:25.317
me...

07:25.946 --> 07:27.486
Or...

07:28.073 --> 07:31.123
Tolliver hangs!

- What?

08:00.105 --> 08:02.525
[dramatic score]

08:04.526 --> 08:05.986
So, what happens now?

08:06.111 --> 08:09.361
I guess we find a killer
or we lose a client.

08:09.990 --> 08:11.530
The hard way.

08:15.787 --> 08:17.367
- [gentle score]
- [birds chirping]

08:21.459 --> 08:23.589
This is why we can’t have
nice things.

08:23.712 --> 08:25.212
Well, see if you can fix it.

08:25.338 --> 08:27.088
It worked okay
until it overheated.

08:27.215 --> 08:29.045
[August sighs]

08:29.175 --> 08:30.715
No respect.

08:30.844 --> 08:34.354
So, somebody murdered her
and made it look like a suicide?

08:34.806 --> 08:36.386
Apparently.

08:36.516 --> 08:38.056
Look, I don’t have to tell
any of you what it’s gonna do

08:38.184 --> 08:40.734
to our reputation
if another one of our clients...

08:40.854 --> 08:42.614
- Our reputation?
- ...at the hands of a problem

08:42.731 --> 08:45.901
Our reputation’s more important
than that nice man’s life?

08:46.026 --> 08:47.856
- I don’t think that I said that!
- [Zooey] Okay!

08:47.986 --> 08:50.736
What I don’t understand is
how she doesn’t know who did it.

08:50.864 --> 08:52.374
She was there.

08:52.490 --> 08:53.910
I guess if she was pushed.

08:54.034 --> 08:55.744
You know,
the dead are just like us;

08:56.327 --> 08:58.447
they block out
unpleasant experiences.

08:59.039 --> 09:00.919
But it explains why
she’s still...

09:01.708 --> 09:03.208
hanging around.

09:03.334 --> 09:04.754
[Zooey giggles]

09:04.878 --> 09:07.258
She can’t move on
until she knows "who done it."

09:08.798 --> 09:10.718
So, if we
clear up the murder...

09:10.842 --> 09:13.392
We clear out the house and
we save a client in the bargain.

09:13.511 --> 09:16.721
All right, I’ll do a deep dive
into past owners, as well as

09:16.848 --> 09:19.058
see who knew the bride
when she used to rock and roll.

09:19.684 --> 09:21.104
I’ll check
the first floor.

09:21.227 --> 09:22.767
I’ll take the second.

09:22.896 --> 09:25.436
I’ll take the top floor.
Let’s circle back in an hour.

10:36.469 --> 10:38.009
there was this
hidden compartment.

10:38.138 --> 10:40.138
These were inside. It’s like
she wanted us to find them.

Ooh. Diaries, secrets,

- Genevieve. It’s a start.
- Divide and conquer.

10:47.272 --> 10:48.862
We all take a diary home
and look at it tonight.

10:48.982 --> 10:50.692
We’ll compare notes tomorrow.

10:50.817 --> 10:53.897

Um, I just wanted
to run something by you.

11:14.757 --> 11:16.257
Right. Um...

11:17.302 --> 11:19.602
I was thinking about
getting my real estate license.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.180
- Really?
- Yeah.

11:22.307 --> 11:24.597
You know, I just thought
how hard could it be, right?

11:26.477 --> 11:27.897
Good point. Seriously,

11:28.021 --> 11:29.901
you should totally do it.
You’d be great at it.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.403
So, you’d hire me
as an agent?

11:31.524 --> 11:33.234
In a heartbeat.

11:33.818 --> 11:35.278
Okay. Thank you.

11:35.403 --> 11:37.203
Based on your response,

11:37.322 --> 11:39.242

three months and then I took--

11:47.415 --> 11:48.955
Well, that’s great!
Congratulations.

11:49.375 --> 11:50.875
Oh!

11:51.002 --> 11:52.632
[clears throat]
Thank you.

11:52.754 --> 11:54.964
So did you mean it
about hiring me?

11:55.089 --> 11:57.589
You’re already hired.
I mean, we’ll have to figure out

11:57.717 --> 11:59.637
what this means
as far as staffing and all.

11:59.761 --> 12:01.721
Maybe you can transition
a little at a time?

12:01.846 --> 12:03.426
Yeah, yeah.
Whatever works.

12:03.556 --> 12:05.136
Regardless,

12:05.266 --> 12:06.926
I am super proud of you.

Actually,

13:01.447 --> 13:02.987
[piano playing]

13:12.208 --> 13:13.668
<i>[Susan’s mom]
You loved that house.</i>

13:13.793 --> 13:16.173
<i>[Susan]
It was bright and cheerful</i>

13:16.296 --> 13:19.336
<i>and I would just lie there
and daydream.</i>

13:20.883 --> 13:22.513
<i>That was the one summer
Daddy wasn’t away at work.</i>

13:22.635 --> 13:24.175
<i>Mm.</i>

13:25.430 --> 13:27.520
<i>I would just
lie in the sunshine and...</i>

13:27.932 --> 13:29.682
<i>And listen to him
play piano.</i>

13:31.602 --> 13:33.152
<i>That was a good summer.</i>

13:45.450 --> 13:46.990
- [dramatic boom]
- [gasp]

13:47.952 --> 13:49.542
[clears throat]

13:54.959 --> 13:56.839
[gasps] Shit!

13:57.295 --> 13:59.215
Ah, what happened
to the alarm?

13:59.339 --> 14:01.219
Oh, House, what time
was the alarm set?

14:01.341 --> 14:04.341
<i>Your alarm is set
for 6:15 PM.</i>

14:04.469 --> 14:06.429
No! I meant 6:15 AM!

14:08.097 --> 14:11.557
<i>Alarm is now set
for 6:15 AM.</i>

14:12.310 --> 14:13.850
[lively score]

14:22.653 --> 14:24.283
House, unlock the door.

14:25.198 --> 14:27.028
House!

14:28.785 --> 14:30.245
[expels breath]

14:31.371 --> 14:32.911
[chimes]

14:36.959 --> 14:38.459
[creepy score]

14:39.712 --> 14:42.422
[whooshing]

14:45.176 --> 14:46.586
[gentle score]

14:46.719 --> 14:48.469
- Anybody heard from Susan?
- Uh-uh.

14:49.180 --> 14:50.760
Okay, so,
let’s get started.

14:51.349 --> 14:52.929
All right.

14:53.476 --> 14:56.596
Our Genevieve
is one Genevieve Wilson,

14:56.729 --> 14:59.939
age 49 when she apparently
hanged herself from the banister

15:00.066 --> 15:01.816
a few hours after marrying
her third husband.

15:01.943 --> 15:03.993
Now, the police

15:04.112 --> 15:06.742
wrote it off as a suicide
once they found her note.

15:07.824 --> 15:10.584
Genevieve...
she was kind of a celebrity.

15:10.701 --> 15:12.581
She wrote a bunch of books
on the joys of parenting.

15:12.703 --> 15:15.293
She taught a generation
how to raise their kids.

15:15.415 --> 15:17.675
Now, according to
the police report,

15:17.792 --> 15:19.292
most of the guests
had already gone home;

15:19.419 --> 15:20.959
only four remained in the house.

15:21.087 --> 15:25.297
So, if Genevieve was murdered,
it had to be one of them.

15:29.762 --> 15:31.262
Let’s meet
our contestants.

15:31.389 --> 15:32.929
[energetic cello score]

15:36.394 --> 15:38.154
Save some wine
for the rest of the guests.

15:38.271 --> 15:40.771
Let’s get this picture taken
so we can all go home.

15:40.898 --> 15:42.438
[both laughing]

15:45.069 --> 15:46.609
<i>[Phil] Marilyn Bates,</i>

15:47.280 --> 15:49.280
<i>Genevieve’s editor
and closest friend.</i>

15:50.575 --> 15:53.455
Oh, Judy, for Heaven’s sakes,
will you stop fussing?

15:54.245 --> 15:55.835
<i>Judy Renault,</i>

15:56.247 --> 15:58.457
<i>her long-time
personal assistant.</i>

15:59.792 --> 16:01.842
We are always working.

16:01.961 --> 16:03.841
Nathaniel Hingston,
her teenage son

16:03.963 --> 16:05.973
by way of husband number two.

16:09.260 --> 16:11.850
<i>He wrote a tell-all memoir
about his mom in the 90s.</i>

16:11.971 --> 16:13.721
<i>Now, I sent you all
a digital copy.</i>

16:14.265 --> 16:15.685
Thank you.

16:15.808 --> 16:17.388
Find a spot.

16:19.228 --> 16:20.688
Oh, there he is!

16:20.813 --> 16:23.023
<i>And batting cleanup...</i>

16:23.149 --> 16:24.859
<i>Mr. Arthur Aldean,</i>

16:24.984 --> 16:27.194
<i>freshly minted
husband number three.</i>

16:27.778 --> 16:30.318
Moment, and there you are;
you are perfect.

16:30.448 --> 16:31.988
Thank you, Marilyn.

16:35.119 --> 16:36.749
Now, all their testimony
was the same:

16:36.871 --> 16:39.161
as the party
was winding down,

16:39.290 --> 16:41.750
they all decided to take
one final portrait.

16:44.587 --> 16:46.087
- [camera flash]
- [dramatic boom]

16:46.672 --> 16:49.592
Then Genevieve excused herself
and went upstairs.

16:49.717 --> 16:52.257
It was less than an hour later
that she came back down--

16:53.095 --> 16:54.595
the express route.

16:55.431 --> 16:56.891
It’s gotta be
the husband,

16:57.016 --> 16:59.266
says every
true crime podcast ever.

16:59.393 --> 17:00.853
Now, in her diary,

17:00.978 --> 17:03.438
she said Arthur loved her unreservedly.

17:03.564 --> 17:05.774
The diary I read was mostly
about her son Nathaniel;

17:05.900 --> 17:07.400
what a disappointment he was.

17:07.527 --> 17:09.067
Nathaniel still lives in town.

17:09.779 --> 17:12.239
I emailed him last night
but I don’t expect a response.

17:12.365 --> 17:13.785
That memoir
was pretty brutal.

17:13.908 --> 17:17.198
My diary, Genevieve was
pretty sure everybody loved her.

17:17.328 --> 17:20.908
Especially someone named "W."
A secret lover.

17:21.624 --> 17:24.084
Let’s stick to the suspects
we know were there that night.

17:24.210 --> 17:25.380
Listen to this:

17:25.503 --> 17:28.303
I just got an email back
from the son, Nathaniel.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.722
He’s agreed to come in
and talk to us tonight.

17:31.842 --> 17:33.392
I don’t know.

17:33.511 --> 17:35.551
He seemed pretty creepy
in the diary.

17:35.680 --> 17:37.770
- [phone vibrating]
- I’m sure he’s grown up now.

17:37.890 --> 17:39.430
Susan just texted me.

17:40.476 --> 17:42.096
She stopped by
the Tolliver house

17:42.228 --> 17:43.648
in between showings.

17:43.771 --> 17:45.231
Well, was he there?

17:45.356 --> 17:46.896
No.

17:47.525 --> 17:49.155
But I think
the bride is getting impatient.

17:49.277 --> 17:50.817
[dramatic score flourish]

17:54.782 --> 17:56.242
[gentle score]

17:56.367 --> 17:57.827
A little reminder
of what’s going to happen

17:57.952 --> 18:00.502
to poor Mr. Tolliver
if we don’t figure this out.

18:00.621 --> 18:02.121
We can’t let that happen.

18:02.248 --> 18:04.078
Find anything interesting
in your diary?

18:04.208 --> 18:06.538
Soft-core porn
about somebody named W.

18:06.669 --> 18:08.169
Yeah, he shows up everywhere.

18:08.296 --> 18:09.756
She said some
pretty awful things

18:09.880 --> 18:12.090
about Nathaniel, too.
Her son?

18:12.216 --> 18:13.676
Oh, yeah.
I forgot to tell you--

18:13.801 --> 18:15.391
Sounded like
he was a monster!

18:15.511 --> 18:18.101
Lighting fires,
torturing animals.

18:18.639 --> 18:20.679
Ah! Oh, my God!
I bet he did it!

18:21.309 --> 18:23.349
- Luke, he’s the killer!
- [elevator arriving chime]

18:23.936 --> 18:25.476
Hold that thought.

18:28.190 --> 18:30.190
Hi there.
May I help you?

18:31.736 --> 18:34.146
I’m here
to see a Mr. Orley.

18:34.280 --> 18:36.030
My name is
Nathaniel Hingston.

18:36.949 --> 18:39.449
Oh! You’re the son!
Hiya, Nate!

18:39.577 --> 18:41.497
Nathaniel.

18:42.204 --> 18:44.004
I will go get him
for you.

18:45.041 --> 18:46.501
Can I get you
something to drink?

18:46.626 --> 18:48.496
Do you have any
two percent milk?

18:49.086 --> 18:50.836
Um... No.

18:50.963 --> 18:52.513
Then I’m fine.

18:53.257 --> 18:54.797
[footsteps receding]

18:57.928 --> 18:59.388
You’re joking.

18:59.513 --> 19:01.563
I’m afraid not.
She’s in the house

19:01.682 --> 19:03.312
and she says
she was murdered.

19:03.434 --> 19:05.024
She’s taken the poor man
who owns the house

19:05.144 --> 19:07.524
and is threatening to kill him
if we don’t figure this out.

19:13.110 --> 19:14.650
[hearty laughter]

19:17.281 --> 19:19.701
Mama drama ding-dong.

19:21.369 --> 19:23.949
What can you tell us about
that night, the night she died?

19:24.080 --> 19:25.830
Oh, God.

19:25.956 --> 19:27.496
Judy was...

19:27.625 --> 19:29.175
She was my mother’s assistant.

19:30.002 --> 19:32.212
Judy had climbed down
off the cross

19:32.338 --> 19:34.378
long enough
to clear the dishes.

19:34.507 --> 19:36.257
In her diary,
your mother called Judy

19:36.384 --> 19:38.184
"her good right hand."

19:38.678 --> 19:40.968
Only if Mother’s left hand
was holding a fondue fork

19:41.097 --> 19:43.097
to repeatedly
poke out Judy’s eyes!

19:44.183 --> 19:47.063
Mother loathed weakness
and Judy was...

19:47.812 --> 19:49.562
weak.

19:49.689 --> 19:51.229
But, Nate,
in your memoir you said--

19:51.357 --> 19:53.227
My name is Nathaniel!

19:54.026 --> 19:56.146
And yes, I lost my...

19:56.278 --> 19:57.818
virginity to Judy.

19:58.364 --> 19:59.914
Excuse me.

20:00.950 --> 20:02.490
You are...

20:02.993 --> 20:04.873
You are a Sagittarius, yes?

20:05.871 --> 20:08.041
- I’m an Aries.
- Ah! I knew it.

20:08.165 --> 20:09.625
May I smell your hair?

20:09.750 --> 20:12.590
Oh, I’d rather you didn’t.
Mm.

20:12.712 --> 20:14.252
[whispering] Maybe later.

20:14.839 --> 20:17.719
Yes, Judy took my cherry.

20:17.842 --> 20:19.342
A rather Herculean task.

20:19.468 --> 20:21.258
And then she
proceeded to blackmail me!

20:21.387 --> 20:24.307
Cost me tens of thousands
in allowance!

20:24.432 --> 20:26.102
I could have
slit her throat.

20:26.225 --> 20:27.765
An Aries?

20:28.227 --> 20:29.767
Are you sure?

20:29.895 --> 20:31.435
Pretty sure.

20:32.356 --> 20:34.016
Mm-hm.

20:34.150 --> 20:35.610
Okay.

20:35.735 --> 20:38.155
Anyway, Judy had neither
the outright skills

20:38.279 --> 20:40.489
nor the can-do attitude
to kill anyone.

20:41.031 --> 20:43.531
Besides, this was
a fairly small matter

20:43.659 --> 20:47.079
relative to Marilyn’s
ongoing affair with A-arthur.

20:47.204 --> 20:49.374
- Sorry, what?
- Pardon me?

20:49.498 --> 20:52.918
Oh, yes! Arthur was playing
hide the hamster with Marilyn

20:53.043 --> 20:54.803
the entire time
he was courting Mother.

20:55.337 --> 20:56.797
Shockingly disloyal.

20:56.922 --> 20:59.132
Made me want to toast them both
with a crystal flute

20:59.258 --> 21:03.388
of drain cleaner and watch
as they slowly liquified.

21:04.180 --> 21:06.470
Do you know someone
your mother called W?

21:07.308 --> 21:10.438
[laughs] Her boy toy.

21:11.937 --> 21:13.397
Her refuge,

21:13.522 --> 21:15.072
for when Arthur
couldn’t find the lead

21:15.191 --> 21:16.781
in his Number Two Ticonderoga.

21:16.901 --> 21:18.571
But in her diary,
Genevieve said

21:18.694 --> 21:20.204
that she loved him.

21:20.321 --> 21:21.821
He wasn’t love.
He was...

21:21.947 --> 21:24.117
...exercise.
If I thought he was

21:24.241 --> 21:26.031
a serious contender
for my new daddy,

21:26.160 --> 21:28.000
I’d have taken a pair of
bolt cutters to his little--

21:28.120 --> 21:30.250
Okay, Nathaniel,
I think we get the gist of it.

21:30.372 --> 21:32.122
Thank you so much
for coming by.

21:34.001 --> 21:35.961
You’re judging me.
I feel it.

21:36.086 --> 21:37.746
But you don’t know
what it’s like

21:37.880 --> 21:39.630
to be a mother’s
"proof of concept."

21:39.757 --> 21:41.507
If I seriously thought
she was back in the world,

21:41.634 --> 21:44.684
back in my life, I might
kill every last one of you,

21:44.804 --> 21:46.564
and turn the gun
on myself.

21:46.680 --> 21:49.600
- [dramatic boom]
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

21:49.725 --> 21:51.845
[Susan] Now, just a minute, Nathaniel.

21:51.977 --> 21:53.597
- Hmm.
- [locks open]

21:53.729 --> 21:55.559
[Luke] You really
don’t need to do this.

21:55.689 --> 21:57.399
[tense score]

21:59.610 --> 22:01.700
[tense score fades out]

22:01.821 --> 22:03.361
[sigh]

22:04.573 --> 22:06.123
[gentle score]

22:09.954 --> 22:11.714
For you.

22:12.373 --> 22:13.923
It’s autographed.

22:14.416 --> 22:15.876
In my own blood.

22:16.001 --> 22:18.251
How special.
Thank you.

22:19.296 --> 22:20.836
[sniffs deeply]

22:21.382 --> 22:23.432
- [shuddering sigh]
- Exquisite.

22:31.934 --> 22:33.444
I think
"the mommy that raised America"

22:33.561 --> 22:35.851
should have taken
a few more personal days.

22:36.772 --> 22:38.322
I feel unsafe.

22:38.774 --> 22:41.654
The man’s a carnival ride
with a loose bolt on a...

22:42.319 --> 22:43.779
tight downhill turn.

22:45.114 --> 22:48.664
So, it’s him, right? We agree?
He’s definitely the killer.

22:49.368 --> 22:52.578
So, we gonna tell Genevieve now
or wait ’til Mother’s Day?

22:57.418 --> 22:58.958
[gentle score]

23:02.298 --> 23:04.378
Something about this
just feels wrong.

23:04.508 --> 23:06.048
He totally did it.

23:06.760 --> 23:08.430
He sniffed my hair.

23:08.554 --> 23:10.474
Let’s think this through.

23:11.348 --> 23:13.228
It is possible
that Nathaniel left the room.

23:13.350 --> 23:14.890
[dramatic cello score]

23:16.145 --> 23:17.695
<i>Went into his mother’s room...</i>

23:19.440 --> 23:21.070
<i>Then he choked her
with the golden rope.</i>

23:24.194 --> 23:25.784
[rope creaking]

23:26.447 --> 23:27.987
<i>He wrote the suicide note...</i>

23:31.410 --> 23:33.080
<i>carried his mom
to the stairwell...</i>

23:33.203 --> 23:35.213
[dramatic booms]

23:35.331 --> 23:37.041
[discordant cello score]

23:38.584 --> 23:40.134
- [cello score fades out]
- And...

23:40.711 --> 23:42.251
- [gentle score]
- scene.

23:42.379 --> 23:44.089
Phil, can we take another look
at that note?

23:47.134 --> 23:49.264
I wonder if he inherited
a bunch of money.

23:49.386 --> 23:51.806
No. Genevieve left
her entire estate

23:51.931 --> 23:54.061
to a Shetland pony rescue
in the Outer Hebrides.

23:54.725 --> 23:56.525
Stiffed everyone,
including Nate.

23:56.644 --> 23:58.564
- [August] Nathaniel.
- Hm?

23:59.355 --> 24:01.735
Luke called him Nate and he was
corrected immediately.

24:01.857 --> 24:04.187
Oh, yeah, I did the same thing
when he first came in.

24:04.318 --> 24:06.358
Wants to be referred to
as Nathaniel.

24:06.487 --> 24:08.357
So, it’s pretty doubtful
that he would refer to himself

24:08.489 --> 24:10.569
as Nate
in a suicide note.

24:13.786 --> 24:15.326
Can you put up the
wedding picture again?

24:15.454 --> 24:17.294
- Mm-hm.
- The one with the final four.

24:18.832 --> 24:20.332
Yup. Still a creep.

24:20.459 --> 24:22.129
He sniffed...

24:22.836 --> 24:24.916
- my hair!
- I know. I’m so sorry.

24:25.047 --> 24:26.587
So, if it wasn’t Nathaniel,

24:27.216 --> 24:29.006
who could it be?

24:29.134 --> 24:31.344
What about Judy?
The assistant.

24:31.929 --> 24:33.469
In his book,
Nathaniel said

24:33.597 --> 24:36.347
he told Judy he wasn’t going to
pay her blackmail anymore.

24:37.017 --> 24:38.477
[dramatic cello score]

24:38.602 --> 24:40.732
<i>Maybe Judy went upstairs
to tell all,</i>

24:40.854 --> 24:42.564
<i>they got in a fight,</i>

24:44.984 --> 24:47.114
<i>and she choked Genevieve
with the golden rope.</i>

24:49.571 --> 24:52.701
<i>Judy had been answering
her fan mail for years, so...</i>

24:54.201 --> 24:56.041
<i>the suicide note
was easy and...</i>

24:58.080 --> 24:59.620
<i>you know the rest.</i>

25:00.290 --> 25:01.960
- [cello score fades out]
- [gentle score fades in]

25:02.084 --> 25:04.094
Yeah, I’m not buying it.

25:04.211 --> 25:06.881
See, I still like the husband
for the thing. Arthur.

25:07.006 --> 25:09.796
Nah. He walks with a cane.
There’s no way that

25:09.925 --> 25:12.005
he could drag Genevieve
and toss her over the side.

25:12.136 --> 25:14.386
Not on his own!
Hear me out:

25:15.014 --> 25:17.394
So, Marilyn is hammered, right?

25:17.516 --> 25:20.056
And she can’t think
of a more delicious irony

25:20.185 --> 25:22.145
than to do the groom
on his wedding night.

25:22.271 --> 25:23.861
[dramatic cello score]

25:23.981 --> 25:25.651
<i>But before Arthur could,
you know,</i>

25:25.774 --> 25:27.234
<i>toss the bouquet...</i>

25:27.359 --> 25:29.029
<i>Genevieve comes in.</i>

25:29.153 --> 25:30.703
Oh!

25:31.905 --> 25:33.365
Arthur!

25:33.490 --> 25:35.030
Marilyn!

25:37.077 --> 25:39.577
<i>So, they tandem-choke
Genevieve...</i>

25:39.705 --> 25:41.835
<i>Marilyn ghostwrites
the suicide note...</i>

25:44.960 --> 25:46.840
<i>they lug her to the staircase,
one on each end,</i>

25:46.962 --> 25:48.842
<i>- and they toss her over.</i>
- [dramatic boom]

25:50.007 --> 25:51.797
Teamwork makes
the dream work, baby.

25:51.925 --> 25:53.635
- [cello score ends]
- Just wait a minute:

25:54.470 --> 25:55.930
Police report said
these four people

25:56.055 --> 25:57.895
were the last ones
in the house.

25:58.015 --> 26:00.275
That’s right.
One of them has to be a killer.

26:00.392 --> 26:02.392
So, who took the picture?

26:02.519 --> 26:04.059
[eerie score]

26:09.068 --> 26:10.608
[gentle score]

26:17.576 --> 26:21.116
Yes! Yes, ah, Mr. Hingston,
it’s Susan Ireland from--

26:22.831 --> 26:25.421
The Aries. Yes.

26:25.542 --> 26:27.092
Um, Mr. Hings--

26:27.586 --> 26:29.296
Nathaniel.

26:29.421 --> 26:31.671
- I hate you all.
- [snickering]

26:31.799 --> 26:34.339
So, Nathaniel, um, there is
that photograph

26:34.468 --> 26:36.718
of you all on the night
of your mother’s

26:36.845 --> 26:39.555
wedding-slash-tragic death
and I was wondering

26:39.681 --> 26:41.521
if you could remember
who took it?

26:45.395 --> 26:46.855
Mm-hm. Thanks,

26:46.980 --> 26:49.230
it’s actually a Swedish shampoo
called Jordgubbe.

26:49.358 --> 26:50.938
[snickering]

26:51.068 --> 26:53.818
Um, so the photo,
do you remember who--

26:57.241 --> 26:58.741
Okay.

26:58.867 --> 27:02.247
You’ve been incredibly helpful,
Nathaniel. Thank you.

27:02.913 --> 27:05.213
No, I’m actually
moving out of the country.

27:06.083 --> 27:07.583
Mm-hm.

27:07.709 --> 27:09.209
Forever.

27:09.336 --> 27:13.126
Mm-hm. Yeah.
Okay. Goodbye.

27:14.174 --> 27:15.844
So?

27:15.968 --> 27:18.138
He couldn’t remember exactly
who took the photo,

27:18.262 --> 27:20.352
but it was
somebody on the staff.

27:20.472 --> 27:22.272
Gardener or housekeeper.

27:22.391 --> 27:24.141
Great.

27:24.268 --> 27:25.848
Actually, I found her
personnel records

27:25.978 --> 27:27.348
when I was checking out Judy.

27:27.479 --> 27:28.979
It had a full staff listing.

27:29.106 --> 27:30.726
See if anything
jumps out at you.

27:31.775 --> 27:33.315
Figuratively speaking.

27:35.821 --> 27:37.361
[gentle score]

27:46.915 --> 27:48.955
Phil, Hey.
Whaddaya got?

27:49.084 --> 27:50.634
So, um...

27:50.752 --> 27:52.212
checked those
personnel records.

27:52.337 --> 27:54.007
I thought
that was a dead end?

27:54.131 --> 27:55.841
Yeah, not exactly.
Look at this.

27:58.802 --> 28:00.602
Warden G. Oliver?

28:00.721 --> 28:02.471
Yeah, he was a gardener.
He worked for Genevieve

28:02.598 --> 28:04.678
for about six months
before she was wed.

28:04.808 --> 28:06.848
And... dead.

28:06.977 --> 28:08.437
He quit on this date?
Are you sure?

28:08.562 --> 28:10.272
Yeah; day after the wedding.

28:10.814 --> 28:12.364
Look, um,

28:13.483 --> 28:15.323
I know you really like
this Tolliver guy.

28:15.444 --> 28:17.704
- He is a sweet old man...
- Andrew Tolliver.

28:18.822 --> 28:20.662
Warden Oliver.

28:21.366 --> 28:23.366
And it always gets my attention
when things rhyme.

28:23.493 --> 28:25.753
Think my mother was traumatized
by a greeting card

28:25.871 --> 28:27.411
when I was in utero.

28:28.207 --> 28:30.747
You don’t think
there’s some connection?

28:30.876 --> 28:34.336
The secret lover?
W? Warden?

28:34.963 --> 28:36.883
Could be a coincidence.

28:47.059 --> 28:49.599
Warden is an anagram
for Andrew.

28:51.271 --> 28:52.811
[sigh]

28:54.316 --> 28:55.856
Thought you should know.

29:07.371 --> 29:09.161
<i>[Luke] So, Phil told me
about Tolliver.</i>

29:09.289 --> 29:10.829
<i>Kinda makes sense.</i>

29:10.958 --> 29:13.458
Nothing makes sense.
Luke, I don’t know.

29:13.585 --> 29:15.125
Could we just
talk about it tomorrow?

29:21.301 --> 29:22.841

You’re back...

29:46.660 --> 29:48.200
Miss Ireland.

29:52.165 --> 29:53.785
So glad you’re all right.

29:55.961 --> 29:57.421
Where have you been?

29:57.546 --> 29:59.506
Right where we are now.

30:00.173 --> 30:01.633
[gentle score]

30:01.758 --> 30:03.298
In your dreams.

30:04.177 --> 30:06.007
How did you find me?

30:06.138 --> 30:07.928
Your new house.

30:08.473 --> 30:10.683
It has more magic
than you know.

30:11.476 --> 30:12.936
I don’t understand.

30:13.061 --> 30:15.561
I know.
It’s terribly confusing.

30:16.565 --> 30:18.485
And I’m sorry,
but here we are.

30:20.277 --> 30:21.817
You killed Genevieve.

30:24.239 --> 30:25.909
[sucks teeth]

30:26.033 --> 30:27.583
I offer no defense.

30:29.536 --> 30:31.076
Only an understanding.

30:33.248 --> 30:34.788
I was 22.

30:37.502 --> 30:39.212
Do you remember 22?

30:41.757 --> 30:43.417
She was...

30:43.550 --> 30:45.090
[gentle gasp]

30:46.511 --> 30:48.051
Amazing.

30:49.014 --> 30:50.564
Beautiful.

30:51.016 --> 30:52.556
Powerful.

30:53.226 --> 30:54.766
And she noticed me.

30:55.437 --> 30:56.977
Me...

30:57.105 --> 31:00.355
someone who dug holes
and filled them up for a living.

31:02.069 --> 31:04.359
What we had was wrong.

31:05.989 --> 31:09.739
All I know is our time together
was the happiest I’ve been,

31:10.619 --> 31:12.159
before or...

31:13.163 --> 31:14.713
or since.

31:15.916 --> 31:17.626
I used to call her
my baby doll.

31:20.837 --> 31:23.007
But I told her that we
couldn’t be together anymore.

31:24.007 --> 31:26.377
She’d thought that she
could be married to Arthur,

31:27.052 --> 31:30.012
enjoy his money,
his station

31:30.806 --> 31:32.466
and still be with me?

31:33.809 --> 31:35.349
I told her no.

31:36.228 --> 31:39.898
I didn’t respect myself much,
but, God!

31:40.774 --> 31:42.324
More than that.

31:43.860 --> 31:45.650
Then came the drama.

- Stay away from me.

31:53.245 --> 31:55.335
- We can talk about this.
- Don’t come near me!

31:55.455 --> 31:58.455
No! No, don’t come near me!
You’re killing me!

to that...

33:07.861 --> 33:09.901
that charity
in the Outer Hebrides.

33:10.697 --> 33:12.157
Somewhere out there
there’s a

33:12.282 --> 33:14.992

with quite a portfolio.

33:15.118 --> 33:16.658

But the guilt...

33:22.334 --> 33:23.884

stop the nightmares.</i>

33:33.803 --> 33:35.353
<i>But they just got worse.</i>

33:37.098 --> 33:40.888
Genevieve wasn’t asking you
to find her killer.

33:42.103 --> 33:44.273
She was trying to tell you
that I...

33:45.106 --> 33:46.646
was the killer.

33:48.276 --> 33:49.896
That’s how she sees me.

33:54.115 --> 33:55.655
That’s what I am.

33:57.369 --> 33:58.829
But I loved her.

[tender score]

34:01.081 --> 34:03.791

God, how I loved her.

34:07.587 --> 34:09.337
What can we do?

34:10.131 --> 34:12.301
Some mistakes
you never stop paying for.

34:15.428 --> 34:17.508
But at last
someone knows the truth.

34:19.015 --> 34:20.975
At last I can be at peace.

34:22.394 --> 34:24.904
Nothing is impossible,
Mr. Tolliver.

34:26.398 --> 34:27.938
Not in my dreams.

Oh, you got another call

- Thank you.

35:17.657 --> 35:20.327

- Is there a story there?

35:20.452 --> 35:22.832
None that I care to tell.

35:24.247 --> 35:25.707
Okay.

35:26.458 --> 35:28.838
What’s that supposed to be?
Like, a satellite dish, or...?

35:29.628 --> 35:31.128

35:31.254 --> 35:32.714
Not unlike.

supposed to wear it?

35:35.216 --> 35:36.676
I would imagine Luke.

35:36.801 --> 35:40.601
It may help to restore
a bit of his intuition.

35:42.265 --> 35:45.385
Just don’t mess with his hair.
It’s like a World Heritage Site.

35:47.187 --> 35:49.857
We need to talk to her again.
It was an accident!

35:49.981 --> 35:51.441
Says the killer himself!

35:51.566 --> 35:53.606
Susan, if we learned anything
in the past few days,

35:53.735 --> 35:55.905
that everybody sees everything
through their own lens.

35:56.029 --> 35:57.989
They rationalize.
They prevaricate.

35:58.114 --> 36:00.034
- They lie?
- They lie!

36:00.158 --> 36:02.408
And, frankly, they know
an easy mark when they see one.

36:04.245 --> 36:05.785
So, there’s no redemption.

36:06.414 --> 36:08.924
No hope.
No matter how much regret,

36:09.042 --> 36:10.962
how good a life
you’ve lived otherwise,

36:11.086 --> 36:12.496

A woman in business,
working twice as hard

37:13.314 --> 37:15.524
to get half as far.
I see you!

37:18.695 --> 37:20.245
You got used
by a lot of men.

He didn’t want anything

37:35.920 --> 37:38.460
He didn’t murder you,
it was an accident,

37:38.590 --> 37:40.630
so you need to move on.

37:41.801 --> 37:43.891
And let him do the same.

37:55.565 --> 37:57.695
He loved you, Genevieve.

Granted, the age difference
and power dynamic

38:03.823 --> 38:05.373
could have been a lot better, but...

38:07.827 --> 38:09.947
he didn’t want
anything from you.

38:12.040 --> 38:13.580
Except you.

38:16.169 --> 38:17.709

always telling you

39:34.873 --> 39:36.293
to find a better
work-life balance.

39:36.541 --> 39:38.921
This isn’t about balance.
It’s about getting out of here

39:39.043 --> 39:40.593
and reassessing my life.

39:41.504 --> 39:44.304
I worked for a horrible boss,
Bob Livingston.

39:44.757 --> 39:46.217
I was enveloped by him,

39:46.342 --> 39:48.932
controlled by him
and called it a relationship.

39:49.053 --> 39:51.853
And now I’m here working for you
and it’s starting

39:51.973 --> 39:54.393

of a really shitty song.

39:54.517 --> 39:56.807
I don’t particularly like
being mentioned in that company.

Well, tough, Luke!
Try, just really dig deep

40:01.399 --> 40:04.609

where it isn’t all about you.

at the bowling fundraiser

40:11.743 --> 40:13.953

to organize.

40:14.078 --> 40:16.998
In the meantime, I am going home
to my wonderful new house.

40:17.123 --> 40:18.923
I’m going to spend some
time there, dress it up

40:19.042 --> 40:21.342

I need a new life to match.
