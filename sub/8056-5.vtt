WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:03.379
Mmm. Eyeballs, rats,
bats, vampire teeth.

00:03.436 --> 00:05.438
Boom. Vampire teeth.
Good.

00:05.505 --> 00:07.451
Spiderwebs.
Done.

00:08.408 --> 00:09.910
Fake blood capsules.

00:09.976 --> 00:12.149
They didn't have any.
Really?

00:14.447 --> 00:16.256
That's gross. I love it.

00:16.315 --> 00:18.728
We are throwing a Halloween
party at our house.

00:18.785 --> 00:20.492
It's gonna be
the greatest thing ever.

00:20.553 --> 00:22.590
Someone will die.
Of fun.

00:22.655 --> 00:23.656
And of murder.

00:23.723 --> 00:26.829
There's going to be beer, pumpkins...
Bloody goblins.

00:26.893 --> 00:29.271
Fake ones. It's gonna be awesome.
We have decorations.

00:29.329 --> 00:30.831
Dead people that
we just murdered.

00:30.897 --> 00:34.310
Not murdered, but pictures of
dead people from TV or movies.

00:34.367 --> 00:36.472
Mutilated bodies.
But fake ones.

00:36.536 --> 00:39.983
Candy, dancing, tequila.
All kinds of food and snacks.

00:40.040 --> 00:42.884
Blood orphans.
No blood orphans.

00:42.942 --> 00:45.286
I don't know what that is.

00:47.000 --> 00:53.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:05.932 --> 01:09.573
I want you on message, and
the message is Leslie Knope.

01:09.636 --> 01:10.944
If you're not
talking about you,

01:11.004 --> 01:12.244
you're talking
about the wrong thing.

01:12.305 --> 01:13.807
I hate talking about myself.

01:13.873 --> 01:17.343
Get over it. I talk about myself constantly.
Everyone loves me for it.

01:17.410 --> 01:19.321
I really am amazing.

01:19.379 --> 01:21.290
When you work in government,
people often suspect

01:21.347 --> 01:22.382
that you're anti-business.

01:22.449 --> 01:24.827
So I'm throwing a little meet
and greet with business owners,

01:24.884 --> 01:26.488
and I've asked
Tom's company to help.

01:26.553 --> 01:29.227
Here's my opening line.
Hi. I'm Leslie Knope,

01:29.289 --> 01:31.701
and I'm in the business
of being City Councilor.

01:31.758 --> 01:33.362
Oh, my God.
I'm not going to use that.

01:33.426 --> 01:35.804
This is your primary target.

01:35.862 --> 01:37.773
President of the Chamber of
Commerce, Martin Kernston.

01:37.831 --> 01:42.246
Oh, yes. From Kernston Rubber Nipples.
The Nipple King.

01:43.269 --> 01:47.012
Photos, bios, likes, dislikes,
prescription medications.

01:47.073 --> 01:49.451
I've heard of Martin Kernston.
I know a little bit about him.

01:49.509 --> 01:51.819
Oh, really? Well, which of his
advisors does he trust more,

01:51.878 --> 01:53.221
Ted Flirtman or Rex Baggs?

01:53.279 --> 01:55.225
Well, it depends. Flirtman
is more of a confidant.

01:55.281 --> 01:56.919
I made up both those names.

01:56.983 --> 01:58.291
Okay, I'm on it.

02:00.053 --> 02:01.191
Get at me.

02:01.254 --> 02:03.393
Jean-Ralphio, stop crying.

02:03.456 --> 02:06.835
What? Hold on.
Slow down. Hold on.

02:07.994 --> 02:11.669
Allergic to chestnuts and...

02:12.499 --> 02:14.376
Good haircuts.

02:21.875 --> 02:24.879
It's too tight. Looser. I
feel like we need to inflate it more.

02:24.944 --> 02:27.925
No, I told you. I'm a sumo
wrestler after he lost the weight.

02:27.981 --> 02:29.551
I take it
we're having a party.

02:29.983 --> 02:33.396
Dude, I knew there was something
I forgot to tell you. Sorry.

02:33.453 --> 02:34.488
No, no, no. It's fine.

02:34.554 --> 02:36.932
Why should you guys tell me you
were gonna have an enormous party?

02:36.990 --> 02:39.470
I didn't tell you I was gonna
be quietly working in my room.

02:39.526 --> 02:40.834
- That's a good point.
- Yeah, yeah.

02:40.894 --> 02:42.066
I guess we're even.

02:42.128 --> 02:43.801
If you need me,
I'll definitely be awake,

02:43.863 --> 02:47.709
because I won't be able to
sleep because of the party.

02:47.934 --> 02:49.607
You know? So...

02:51.404 --> 02:52.576
All right.

02:52.639 --> 02:54.915
My family is very
non-confrontational.

02:54.974 --> 02:56.885
My parents' method
of problem solving is

02:56.943 --> 02:58.752
to kind of keep
everything bottled up

02:58.811 --> 03:02.088
and just subtly hint
at what's bothering them.

03:02.148 --> 03:06.255
And after 36 years,
they are still divorced.

03:08.254 --> 03:09.562
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

03:09.622 --> 03:11.693
Tom, this is not
what I pictured at all.

03:11.758 --> 03:14.500
This looks like a party
for Entertainment 720.

03:14.561 --> 03:17.041
Is Entertainment 720
running for office?

03:17.096 --> 03:18.598
It's a small business.

03:18.665 --> 03:19.666
You're trying to
show people you have

03:19.732 --> 03:21.837
a good relationship
with small businesses.

03:21.901 --> 03:23.744
Now the party?
That's all about you, boo.

03:23.803 --> 03:25.942
Okay. Then shouldn't my face
be on these rugs?

03:26.005 --> 03:27.484
I'm sorry, no.

03:27.540 --> 03:30.111
It's always been a dream of mine to
be a rug, and it's finally happened.

03:30.176 --> 03:31.519
Tom, now is not
the time for you

03:31.578 --> 03:33.421
to explore your
weird dreams, okay?

03:33.479 --> 03:35.891
I want all of this gone.
All of it.

03:35.949 --> 03:39.328
Except that cake. Keep that cake here.
Just scrape off the words.

03:44.457 --> 03:49.634
Donna? Blue shirt,
badge, night stick.

03:50.029 --> 03:52.339
You are a policewoman.

03:52.398 --> 03:53.843
Yep. You're a regular...

03:53.900 --> 03:57.313
Sherlock Holmes. I solved
that mystery before you did.

03:57.370 --> 03:59.247
Okay, this was fun.

04:00.073 --> 04:04.283
Andy, you are U.F.C. legend, Chuck Liddell.
That's right.

04:05.078 --> 04:06.386
Girl from The Ring.

04:06.446 --> 04:08.756
To me, Sherlock
Holmes is literally

04:08.815 --> 04:11.352
the greatest character
in the Western canon.

04:11.417 --> 04:14.057
Smart, intuitive, handsome.

04:14.120 --> 04:15.929
Replace his pasty
British frailty

04:15.989 --> 04:18.993
with superhuman physical
fitness, and you get...

04:19.058 --> 04:21.038
Sherlock Traeger.

04:21.094 --> 04:23.973
Mr. Potato Head.
That's right.

04:24.030 --> 04:26.738
Hey, where's my lovely daughter tonight?
She's at home.

04:26.799 --> 04:27.800
I knew that
you would be here,

04:27.867 --> 04:29.312
and I was worried
that you might be

04:29.369 --> 04:31.042
concerned seeing us
together at night.

04:31.104 --> 04:32.105
You're a very
thoughtful guy,

04:32.171 --> 04:33.548
but really,
I have no problem

04:33.606 --> 04:35.279
with the two of you
dating, really.

04:35.341 --> 04:38.254
I mean, look at you. You're
just, you know, beautiful.

04:38.311 --> 04:41.349
You're beautiful. On the inside
where your spirit lives.

04:41.414 --> 04:43.860
Listen. Tell her, "Come to the
party," and I don't mind at all.

04:43.916 --> 04:46.021
Oh, good. I'll text her.

04:48.321 --> 04:50.198
Okay. You can text
without looking at your phone?

04:50.256 --> 04:51.894
I think it's rude
not to maintain eye contact

04:51.958 --> 04:55.303
with the people that I'm talking to.

04:55.361 --> 04:56.396
That's from me.

04:56.462 --> 04:59.443
Wow! That's amazing!

04:59.499 --> 05:01.172
High five.
Wow.

05:04.103 --> 05:06.879
Hey. Ron. Good to see you.

05:06.939 --> 05:08.612
Weren't you
a pirate last year?

05:08.675 --> 05:11.622
Yes. This is my
Halloween costume.

05:11.678 --> 05:15.353
Andrew, are you aware that your
bathroom faucet is leaking?

05:15.415 --> 05:18.953
Are you kidding me? I just
stuffed a sock in it yesterday.

05:19.018 --> 05:20.554
What else
do they want me to do?

05:20.620 --> 05:23.624
There's an exposed wire
above the bathtub as well.

05:23.690 --> 05:25.931
Oh, yeah. Shock wire.

05:25.992 --> 05:30.338
I call it that, 'cause if you take
a shower, and you touch the wire,

05:30.396 --> 05:31.932
YOU die!

05:32.398 --> 05:34.344
Yes, that is accurate.

05:34.400 --> 05:36.346
Do you have a tool box?
Yeah.

05:36.636 --> 05:40.106
No home is complete
without a proper toolbox.

05:40.173 --> 05:42.016
Here's April and Andy's.

05:42.508 --> 05:46.115
A hammer, half of a pretzel,

05:46.179 --> 05:51.458
baseball card, some cartridge
that says Sonic and Hedgehog,

05:51.517 --> 05:53.997
a scissor half,
and a flashlight.

05:55.421 --> 05:57.492
Filled with jelly beans.

06:01.961 --> 06:04.237
Although I have not worked
with you professionally,

06:04.297 --> 06:05.674
as a private citizen,

06:05.732 --> 06:07.473
I have personally patronized

06:07.533 --> 06:09.638
each and every one
of your establishments.

06:09.702 --> 06:12.273
I've never seen you buy a
salad at Sue's Salads.

06:12.338 --> 06:13.874
That's because
I don't hate myself, Tania.

06:14.774 --> 06:17.482
I'm sorry. I know I should
be chasing your vote,

06:17.543 --> 06:18.988
but I stand
behind my decision

06:19.045 --> 06:21.116
to avoid salad
and other disgusting things.

06:21.180 --> 06:24.184
And I think I have a lot of support
in the community for that.

06:24.250 --> 06:27.254
Despite the fact that this seems
like a party for Tom's face,

06:27.320 --> 06:29.027
uh, I think
it's going pretty well.

06:29.088 --> 06:32.331
When in doubt,
in Pawnee, slam salad.

06:32.392 --> 06:34.895
I'm just especially thankful that
you could come, Mr. President.

06:34.961 --> 06:36.440
Martin.
Martin.

06:36.496 --> 06:38.476
You were responsible for
the Harvest Festival, right?

06:38.531 --> 06:41.808
No. Yes. Well, it was a team effort.
I barely did anything.

06:41.868 --> 06:44.747
I held them back, actually.
They succeeded despite me.

06:46.672 --> 06:49.653
I'm sorry. I worked very hard
on that event. I'm just...

06:49.709 --> 06:53.054
Bureaucrats aren't used to bragging
about themselves.

06:53.112 --> 06:55.388
Tom, come over here and
talk about how great I am.

06:55.448 --> 06:58.156
Martin! Tom Haverford
I threw this shindig.

06:58.217 --> 07:01.164
Yes. Tom, tell Martin how hard I
worked on the Harvest Festival.

07:01.220 --> 07:03.063
It was incredible.

07:03.122 --> 07:04.863
A lot of people say
the Harvest Festival

07:04.924 --> 07:06.631
is what launched
Entertainment 720.

07:06.692 --> 07:08.035
No one says that.
I just said it.

07:08.094 --> 07:10.165
My company,
Entertainment 720,

07:10.229 --> 07:13.005
has an amazing business
opportunity for Kernston's.

07:13.065 --> 07:16.137
Mind if I steal you away a few
seconds, give you the 'tails?

07:16.202 --> 07:18.148
The 'tails?
The details.

07:18.204 --> 07:21.276
Most people would probably say
the deets I say the 'tails.

07:21.340 --> 07:22.944
Just one example
of innovation.

07:23.009 --> 07:28.015
Look, I don't like to throw around
the word butt-head too often.

07:28.080 --> 07:29.354
If you call
everybody a butt-head,

07:29.415 --> 07:30.826
then it kind of
loses its impact.

07:30.883 --> 07:33.090
But I can say
without hesitation

07:33.152 --> 07:35.496
that Tom is
being a real dick.

07:37.190 --> 07:40.694
Hey. You stole the Nipple King.
Thanks a lot, traitor.

07:40.760 --> 07:42.535
I'm sorry. I just needed to
ask him about this one thing.

07:42.595 --> 07:44.939
But we're all good now. What if I
just introduce you for your speech?

07:44.997 --> 07:46.943
I have a better idea. Why don't
you go over to one of your rugs

07:46.999 --> 07:50.242
and sit on your own face? I
don't need your help anymore.

07:52.738 --> 07:55.116
Hi, there. ls there a
project you're working on?

07:55.174 --> 07:57.620
I know more than you.
All right.

07:58.845 --> 08:00.518
When April
and Andy married,

08:00.580 --> 08:02.526
I didn't get them
a wedding present.

08:02.582 --> 08:04.823
In my experience, wedding
presents are nothing more

08:04.884 --> 08:07.660
than kindling on
the divorce bonfire.

08:07.720 --> 08:11.463
But I think I found a way I can
really help them make a home.

08:13.659 --> 08:16.037
You, bean bag,
come with me.

08:16.095 --> 08:17.403
I'm an eggplant.

08:17.463 --> 08:19.568
I don't care. Come with me. Why?

08:19.632 --> 08:20.872
I need small hands.

08:22.969 --> 08:25.176
I'm scared.

08:27.173 --> 08:31.679
Look who decided to join the party.
Bro, that's awesome!

08:31.744 --> 08:33.052
Where's your costume?

08:33.111 --> 08:36.150
Honey, he's wearing a costume.
He's going as lame.

08:37.049 --> 08:39.325
That's a pretty
good costume, actually.

08:39.385 --> 08:42.491
But I think the Batman costume is way better.
You should go wear that.

08:42.554 --> 08:44.364
Yeah, I don't think
I'm gonna put on a costume,

08:44.423 --> 08:48.565
because I'm not really attending
this party that's at my house.

08:48.628 --> 08:51.507
Hey, listen, if you're mad about
something you should just...

08:51.564 --> 08:53.510
No. I'm not.
I'm not mad.

08:53.566 --> 08:55.136
Really? Listen,
I feel like you are mad.

08:55.201 --> 08:58.341
So maybe you should
just talk to us about it.

08:58.404 --> 09:03.353
My name's Ben. I'm mad.

09:03.409 --> 09:05.047
All right. That was great.
Thank you. So soft.

09:05.111 --> 09:06.181
Soft lips
Thanks for that.

09:06.245 --> 09:08.521
Your fingers are salty.
I'm going to finish my work.

09:08.581 --> 09:11.562
Orin, no! No! Stay out!

09:11.617 --> 09:13.619
Pawnee has suffered
through a tough economy

09:13.686 --> 09:17.828
and what has kept our town alive
is you, the small businessman.

09:17.890 --> 09:19.995
And I'm not referring
to your stature, Gary.

09:20.059 --> 09:22.437
You are a giant
in this community.

09:22.495 --> 09:24.702
So many businesses
represented here today.

09:24.764 --> 09:27.210
Food and Stuff, J.J.'s Diner,

09:27.266 --> 09:31.510
Glennmore Discount Cemetery,
Tramp Stamp Tattoos,

09:31.571 --> 09:35.576
Enormous Kenny's Fried Dough
Stand and Mobile Phone Emporium.

09:35.641 --> 09:37.552
Who else? Sue's Salads.

09:37.610 --> 09:38.680
Ooh!

09:38.744 --> 09:42.658
Smooth Operator Bikini Waxes,
Geoff's Savings and Loan...

09:42.715 --> 09:45.195
And Entertainment 720.

09:45.251 --> 09:47.731
Thank you so much for that
amazing intro, Leslie.

09:47.787 --> 09:49.733
Hi, folks.
My name is Tom Haverford,

09:49.789 --> 09:51.427
and I am here to
tell you a little bit

09:51.490 --> 09:53.470
about Pawnee's
premiere entertainment

09:53.526 --> 09:55.199
<i>and mufti-media
conglomerate...</i>

09:55.261 --> 10:00.677
Entertainment 720 Where
dreams come, they come true

10:01.801 --> 10:03.872
How about we watch
this brief promotional film?

10:03.936 --> 10:05.313
What?

10:06.172 --> 10:09.517
Entertainment 720 has been a fixture
of this community since June.

10:09.575 --> 10:13.785
Tom, listen to me. Turn that off
or give me the remote right now.

10:13.846 --> 10:15.553
It's short. Can you
let it play, please?

10:15.615 --> 10:17.060
You're lucky that
Martin Kernston is here,

10:17.116 --> 10:18.561
'cause you're gonna
need another nipple.

10:18.618 --> 10:19.926
Why?

10:49.382 --> 10:52.226
There. I think I got it.
Yep, you got it.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.391
Can you at least
tell me what you're doing?

10:56.455 --> 11:00.267
I'm a homeowner. I would like
to actually learn something.

11:01.360 --> 11:05.570
Yeah, I'm tightening the valve
stem into the valve shank.

11:05.631 --> 11:09.238
I'm replacing the handle, and
then tightening the set screw,

11:09.301 --> 11:11.975
which will hold it
in place. Now...

11:12.571 --> 11:14.744
Oh, my God. We made it work.

11:14.807 --> 11:18.983
It's a good feeling. Sense
of accomplishment and pride.

11:19.045 --> 11:21.616
Damn it,
I just love it so much.

11:24.116 --> 11:26.153
Are you okay?
Great.

11:26.218 --> 11:27.663
I'm going to go
around this house

11:27.720 --> 11:30.326
and fix everything I can
find that needs fixing.

11:30.389 --> 11:33.199
You want to help?
I really do.

11:33.259 --> 11:35.762
Good. That's next.

11:37.363 --> 11:40.173
I can't reveal my identity because
of various corporate enemies.

11:40.232 --> 11:44.408
<i>But suffice it to say I run</i> a <i>fairly
popular social networking site</i>

11:44.470 --> 11:46.609
And let's face it,

11:46.672 --> 11:50.176
booking E 720 was the smartest
decision I ever made.

11:50.242 --> 11:52.950
<i>I hope you liked this story.</i>

11:54.113 --> 11:55.888
I invented Facebook.

11:55.948 --> 11:57.393
Wow. Okay. Um...

11:58.217 --> 12:01.630
I know that video seemed like
the rantings of a lunatic

12:01.687 --> 12:03.462
pretending to be
Mark Zuckerberg.

12:03.522 --> 12:05.160
That's who that was?
No.

12:05.224 --> 12:06.567
That is impressive.

12:06.625 --> 12:08.434
We're not gonna waste
any more of your time.

12:08.494 --> 12:09.996
Agreed.
Let's get right to it.

12:10.062 --> 12:13.009
Please welcome the
E 720 Mailing List Divas!

12:15.201 --> 12:19.411
I want all y'all to write down
the name and direct phone line

12:19.472 --> 12:21.975
for whoever is in charge of
hiring independent contractors

12:22.041 --> 12:23.918
for your business!

12:23.976 --> 12:27.355
Now, come join me and
let's all take a dip in

12:27.413 --> 12:30.292
the E 720 Mobile Hot Tub!

12:30.382 --> 12:33.556
It's parked right outside.
Let's go!

12:38.491 --> 12:39.799
Hey, Ben.
Hey.

12:39.859 --> 12:40.894
I thought you weren't
coming to the party.

12:40.960 --> 12:43.304
Well, I'm just
having a Butterfinger.

12:43.362 --> 12:45.103
Oh, really?
Is that okay?

12:45.531 --> 12:48.876
No. If you're not part of the
party, you can't have the candy.

12:48.934 --> 12:50.140
Back up.
All right.

12:50.202 --> 12:51.203
Back up.
Okay.

12:51.270 --> 12:55.309
I have one sister.
We steal each other's stuff,

12:55.374 --> 12:57.012
hack each other's
Twitter accounts,

12:57.076 --> 12:59.955
set each other's
clothes on fire.

13:00.012 --> 13:01.548
There are no rules.

13:04.250 --> 13:05.729
We need to deal with
what's bothering you.

13:05.785 --> 13:07.128
Oh, please,
come into my room.

13:07.186 --> 13:10.133
See, you're angry at me, and
you're not talking about it.

13:10.189 --> 13:14.365
And I'm going to beat you up until
you do, because I'm mature.

13:14.426 --> 13:16.201
What are you... Stop it.

13:16.262 --> 13:20.267
I grew up with five brothers, and
we fought using the Dwyer method,

13:20.332 --> 13:24.872
which was yelling,
wrestling, crying

13:24.937 --> 13:28.111
followed by lots of hugs.

13:28.174 --> 13:29.676
And then more wrestling,
but the fun kind.

13:29.742 --> 13:32.848
And then crying when the fun kind
of wrestling got out of hand.

13:32.912 --> 13:36.450
Can you let me go? Not until
you tell me what's wrong.

13:38.818 --> 13:41.321
Mr. President,
I just want to apologize

13:41.387 --> 13:43.025
for the actions of
that little weasel.

13:43.088 --> 13:46.968
Leslie, I'm a frugal man. I don't
like extravagance or showmanship.

13:47.026 --> 13:49.063
That's why
I cut my own hair.

13:49.128 --> 13:51.540
And it's what's made me
a successful businessman.

13:51.597 --> 13:55.067
So if Entertainment 720 is the
kind of business you trust,

13:55.134 --> 13:58.013
I'm afraid you and I
don't share the same values.

14:07.813 --> 14:08.883
There you are,
you little bastard.

14:08.948 --> 14:10.427
Get out of there
right now.

14:10.482 --> 14:12.689
Leslie, can you do me a favor
and just let me sit here?

14:12.751 --> 14:15.595
Tom, get out of your stupid
limousine hot tub right now,

14:15.654 --> 14:16.997
or we are
no longer friends.

14:17.056 --> 14:18.592
I'm not getting out.

14:18.657 --> 14:20.659
Fine. Then I'm getting in.

14:22.161 --> 14:23.162
Listen to me.

14:23.229 --> 14:24.435
You know what you are?
Get away from me!

14:24.496 --> 14:26.169
You're such a little
selfish punk, okay?

14:26.232 --> 14:27.438
Just because
you want something

14:27.499 --> 14:28.876
doesn't mean that
everybody has to bow to...

14:28.934 --> 14:31.380
Listen to me. You didn't even
let me have my one night.

14:31.437 --> 14:33.314
Look at me. I don't
want to see your face.

14:33.372 --> 14:35.181
Look at me. I don't
want to see your face.

14:35.241 --> 14:38.711
I've been looking
at your face all night. God!

14:38.777 --> 14:40.814
I'm sorry.
What's wrong with you?

14:41.981 --> 14:44.757
My company
is bankrupt, okay?

14:44.817 --> 14:46.854
Entertainment 720 is dead.

14:48.087 --> 14:49.464
Oh, man.

14:54.193 --> 14:55.934
Excuse us!

14:57.029 --> 14:58.167
Nice form, son.

14:58.230 --> 15:00.267
Make sure you keep a firm
pressure on the cranium.

15:00.332 --> 15:01.367
On the cranium?

15:01.433 --> 15:04.676
Listen up. I have to turn off
the power for one minute.

15:04.737 --> 15:07.581
We're going to go dark, people.
Bear with us, okay?

15:07.640 --> 15:09.916
We've got to switch
off the main fuse hose.

15:09.975 --> 15:14.185
It's just a fuse. It's just
a fuse, people Just a fuse.

15:27.893 --> 15:29.770
Well, maybe we should
get out of this hot tub.

15:29.828 --> 15:32.741
I'm too sad to get out,
and I'm all pruney.

15:32.798 --> 15:34.334
What happened?
I don't know.

15:34.400 --> 15:36.505
I guess I just didn't
moisturize enough this morning,

15:36.568 --> 15:40.607
and I've been laying around here...
With the company, Tom.

15:40.673 --> 15:42.778
We're hemorrhaging cash
ever since we opened.

15:42.841 --> 15:44.684
They say you've got to
spend money to make money.

15:44.743 --> 15:48.555
Well, I don't know where we went wrong.
We spent all of our money.

15:48.614 --> 15:51.618
Okay.
You know what you need?

15:51.684 --> 15:53.686
Some good old-fashioned
comfort food.

15:53.752 --> 15:54.753
Where we gonna
get albacore tuna

15:54.820 --> 15:56.424
with crispy onions
at this hour?

15:56.488 --> 15:57.489
Come on.

15:57.556 --> 16:00.469
I'd say you've got the handle
on that torque wrench.

16:00.526 --> 16:02.335
Yeah, well, the flange
was a little warped,

16:02.394 --> 16:05.432
so I just goosed it with a
triple-three bolt smack.

16:05.497 --> 16:06.669
That was nonsense.

16:06.732 --> 16:09.212
I know, but it's so fun
to talk like that.

16:09.268 --> 16:12.374
You know what? Keep this.

16:14.206 --> 16:15.651
You earned it.

16:15.708 --> 16:17.312
Thanks, Ron.

16:24.950 --> 16:26.952
I need to get more chips.
Great.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.494
Let's go.

16:34.059 --> 16:35.732
Come on. Walk.
No.

16:35.794 --> 16:39.970
This is a pacifist protest. Had enough?
You need to let go of me.

16:40.666 --> 16:43.408
Yeah! Get it! That's good.
Here we go. No. No.

16:46.105 --> 16:48.483
Let go of me!
He's got his back!

16:49.208 --> 16:52.849
Come on! Fight me!
No. No. No.

16:53.712 --> 16:54.918
Oh!

16:56.215 --> 16:59.958
Nice! Yeah! Oh, my God.
Andy, I am so sorry.

17:00.219 --> 17:03.530
Psych! Blood capsules.

17:03.589 --> 17:04.761
Oh!

17:04.823 --> 17:06.358
What?
Yeah!

17:06.425 --> 17:09.895
I wanted to shock you
into expressing your anger.

17:09.962 --> 17:11.964
And that way...
My nose is broken.

17:12.031 --> 17:14.032
Oh, my God. I've got
to go to the hospital.

17:14.098 --> 17:15.305
Oh, my God.
Didn't it feel good?

17:15.367 --> 17:17.142
Come here.
Yeah. Yeah.

17:17.636 --> 17:19.273
Wow, I thought you guys
were doing great.

17:19.338 --> 17:20.612
I remember trying
to hire you once,

17:20.705 --> 17:22.777
and you said
you were all booked up.

17:22.840 --> 17:24.945
That was a business tactic
For the first two weeks,

17:25.010 --> 17:27.547
we told everyone we were booked
solid to make people want us more.

17:27.613 --> 17:30.594
Oh, no. That's the stupidest
idea I've ever heard.

17:31.316 --> 17:32.920
Well, hindsight is 20/20.

17:32.985 --> 17:34.430
Kind of seems like
regular sight

17:34.486 --> 17:35.692
should have
caught that one.

17:35.754 --> 17:38.325
Also, your logo, it's the
worst logo I've ever seen.

17:38.390 --> 17:40.802
It doesn't make any sense.
It's gibberish.

17:40.859 --> 17:43.169
We made some mistakes.

17:44.263 --> 17:48.473
Tonight was my last chance to land
a big client, and I failed again.

17:48.534 --> 17:50.275
God, it's so embarrassing.

17:50.335 --> 17:54.306
Hey, Tom. You're a smart guy
and charming occasionally.

17:54.373 --> 17:57.320
You're going to have
a lot more good ideas.

17:58.010 --> 17:59.990
Thanks.

18:00.045 --> 18:01.888
I'm sorry I screwed up
your campaign thing.

18:01.947 --> 18:03.756
I really wanted
to do a good job.

18:04.016 --> 18:06.895
I made you this
amazing video biography.

18:06.952 --> 18:09.193
Of my life?
It's back at the office.

18:09.254 --> 18:11.495
Well, let's eat and go.

18:11.557 --> 18:13.628
Didn't I ask for whipped
cream on this? Ma'am?

18:13.992 --> 18:16.029
Oh. Does it hurt?

18:16.095 --> 18:18.439
Yeah. You broke my nose, so...
I'm sorry.

18:18.497 --> 18:22.104
But I don't even care. Just get
it all out there, man. Go.

18:22.167 --> 18:23.874
All right. Maybe you
have to start thinking

18:23.969 --> 18:26.142
about how your
actions affect me.

18:26.205 --> 18:30.210
Like, tell me about stuff
happening in the house.

18:30.275 --> 18:33.188
Stop referring to my
bedroom as a common space.

18:33.245 --> 18:36.454
Stop using my comforter
for your pillow forts.

18:36.515 --> 18:38.552
Just respect me.

18:38.617 --> 18:40.062
Absolutely.
Really?

18:40.119 --> 18:42.463
Yep. And in return,
I'll only ask for one thing,

18:42.521 --> 18:44.694
which is for you to pay
for studio recording time

18:44.756 --> 18:46.201
for my band
to do our new album.

18:46.258 --> 18:48.602
It's going to be about
5,600 bucks. Deal?

18:48.660 --> 18:50.765
That's not
going to happen.

18:50.829 --> 18:54.003
Here's something for
the pain and some ice packs.

18:54.466 --> 18:56.343
You his friend?
Him?

18:56.401 --> 18:57.641
Hell, no.

18:58.737 --> 19:00.410
We're brothers.

19:01.974 --> 19:03.954
- Excuse me. Hey.
- Hi.

19:04.009 --> 19:06.546
We should go.
I'm blocking an ambulance.

19:06.612 --> 19:08.148
Ew. If your nose
is all weird after this,

19:08.213 --> 19:09.419
I'm totally
going to divorce you.

19:09.481 --> 19:10.721
Whatever. I'm going
to divorce you first

19:10.782 --> 19:12.386
for wearing my
favorite hoodie.

19:13.352 --> 19:14.558
Is everything cool?

19:14.620 --> 19:17.362
Yeah. It is.
Let's go.

19:17.422 --> 19:20.266
We just can't use Ben's comforters
anymore for our pillow forts.

19:20.325 --> 19:22.703
What are we
going to have sex on?

19:25.531 --> 19:28.671
The year was 1975.

19:28.734 --> 19:30.839
It was a time of trouble.

19:30.903 --> 19:32.405
- Watergate.
- Well, I'm not a crook.

19:32.471 --> 19:37.011
Vietnam,
Peter Gabriel leaves Genesis.

19:37.075 --> 19:39.817
But then a ray <i>of hope</i>

19:40.746 --> 19:46.059
Leslie Barbara Knope was
born on January 18th, 1975,

19:46.118 --> 19:49.497
and she has been a loyal patron
of its businesses ever since.

19:49.555 --> 19:54.402
Tom Haverford is a selfish,
unctuous, sleazy, self-promoting,

19:54.459 --> 19:58.339
good-hearted, secretly kind and
wonderful, tiny little person.

19:58.864 --> 20:02.869
He went to Kernston's office and basically
begged him to meet with me again.

20:02.935 --> 20:04.608
I think he technically
might have bribed him.

20:04.670 --> 20:06.843
But hey, you know,
whatever works.

20:06.905 --> 20:08.976
It was Mary Pickford
who once said,

20:09.041 --> 20:12.079
"This thing we call failure
is not the falling down,

20:12.144 --> 20:13.748
"but the staying down."

20:15.147 --> 20:16.922
Tom won't be down for long.

20:17.149 --> 20:21.689
Her name is Leslie Knope,
and I'm going to vote for her.

20:21.753 --> 20:26.668
<i>And if Li'! Sebastian were still
alive, he'd surely vote for her.</i>

20:26.725 --> 20:28.830
And I reckon you should too.

20:31.363 --> 20:35.812
Did you like it? It's pretty great, right?
I worked really hard on it.

20:35.867 --> 20:38.006
Yeah. I loved it.

20:38.070 --> 20:40.516
I'm going to watch it every
day for the rest of my life.

20:40.572 --> 20:44.179
And when I die, I'm going to
project it on my tombstone.

20:47.279 --> 20:50.726
I had an amazing
time at that party.

20:50.782 --> 20:54.286
And in the case of the woman
who's stolen my heart,

20:54.353 --> 20:57.027
the culprit was
Millicent Gergich.

20:57.089 --> 20:59.365
You should look into
actual detective work.

20:59.424 --> 21:03.634
I will. And, Jerry, I've decided
to take your daughter home.

21:03.695 --> 21:05.299
And we may be
having intercourse.

21:05.364 --> 21:07.935
Please, you've got to stop
saying things like that to me.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.139
You got it, man.
Bye, Dad.

21:13.605 --> 21:16.415
Everything okay?
I can't find my car keys.

21:17.576 --> 21:19.647
Solve this mystery, genius.
