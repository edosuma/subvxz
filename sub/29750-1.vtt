- Down!
- Hut! Hut!

01:08.673 --> 01:11.209
Down! Hut!

01:13.244 --> 01:16.115
<i>I remember
my first game of football.</i>

01:17.616 --> 01:21.154
<i>Something happened that
afternoon that's hard to explain.</i>

01:21.887 --> 01:24.157
<i>I felt like I could do anything.</i>

01:25.491 --> 01:27.060
<i>I felt...</i>

01:29.294 --> 01:30.530
<i>free.</i>

01:31.896 --> 01:34.767
<i>I didn't know much about
what that word meant then.</i>

01:36.134 --> 01:37.235
<i>"Free."</i>

01:38.369 --> 01:39.738
<i>Not like I do now.</i>

01:41.240 --> 01:44.243
<i>Freedom doesn't just start
on the football field.</i>

01:45.843 --> 01:48.580
<i>It starts in the mind.</i>

02:00.893 --> 02:02.628
Banks, Brandon, cover two.
Ready?

02:05.530 --> 02:07.666
Go right. Go right.
Come on, bruh!

02:08.232 --> 02:09.633
Wingback. Wing.

02:12.370 --> 02:13.638
Come on!

02:25.517 --> 02:26.752
Good job.

02:27.686 --> 02:28.918
Good hustle today, Banks.

02:28.920 --> 02:30.553
Thanks, Coach.

02:30.555 --> 02:32.821
Though it took a minute for
that muscle memory to kick in.

02:32.823 --> 02:35.894
I know we're not SC,
but we are glad to have you here.

02:49.574 --> 02:52.309
- This is Brian.
- <i>Need you in my office</i>

02:52.311 --> 02:54.376
<i>9:00 a.m. tomorrow morning,
Banks.</i>

02:54.378 --> 02:57.581
Well, I thought our next
meeting wasn't until next month.

02:57.583 --> 02:59.251
<i>Special meeting. Be there.</i>

03:16.734 --> 03:18.270
All right, listen up,
children.

03:18.870 --> 03:20.436
Those of you
who have seen the news,

03:20.438 --> 03:21.737
I'm sure you know,

03:21.739 --> 03:24.006
Sacramento has implemented
a new law last week,

03:24.008 --> 03:27.876
that all 290 registrants
who are currently on parole

03:27.878 --> 03:29.879
must wear one of these.

03:29.881 --> 03:32.781
It's a GPS tracking monitor
that you wear on your ankle.

03:32.783 --> 03:35.485
Put your hand down, son.
I already know your question.

03:35.487 --> 03:36.822
Can you take it off?

03:37.589 --> 03:39.755
The answer is never, ever.

03:39.757 --> 03:42.458
You must wear this thing 24/7.

03:42.460 --> 03:45.695
You charge it in the morning.
You charge it in the evening.

03:45.697 --> 03:48.832
Now, remember,
you must be within LA County,

03:48.834 --> 03:53.372
but cannot be within 2,000 feet
of a school or a park.

03:54.305 --> 03:55.340
Are we clear?

03:56.608 --> 03:59.409
You know I've been playing football
at Long Beach City College.

03:59.411 --> 04:02.646
Not anymore you're not.
You can't bust this thing up.

04:02.648 --> 04:04.380
Can I just remove it
while I play?

04:04.382 --> 04:07.450
- No. No. No way.
- But I gotta play, sir.

04:07.452 --> 04:09.785
You see, I'm trying to work my
way back to a shot at the NFL.

04:09.787 --> 04:11.521
You know how many kids
tell me that every day?

04:11.523 --> 04:15.661
They want to be in the NFL,
NBA, rap stars.

04:16.894 --> 04:18.829
Forget about football.

04:19.765 --> 04:22.064
Boyhood dreams got no place
in a man's life.

04:22.065 --> 04:24.300
You need to concentrate
on getting employed.

04:24.302 --> 04:27.339
Or you can dick around,
end up right back in the system.

04:27.873 --> 04:29.809
It's on you. Next.

04:40.518 --> 04:43.321
No, no, no, no, no, no!

04:43.754 --> 04:45.290
No! No!

04:54.866 --> 04:56.801
Maybe they'll
cut your time short.

04:57.703 --> 04:58.970
They ain't gonna cut it short.

05:02.374 --> 05:04.773
Well, maybe you can
play football when it's up.

05:04.775 --> 05:08.313
Mom, nobody starts
playing football at 27.

06:15.847 --> 06:17.782
I think we'll get along well.

06:29.460 --> 06:31.828
<i>Today marks the culmination</i>

06:31.830 --> 06:35.532
<i>of a five-year battle by the
California Innocence Project</i>

06:35.534 --> 06:36.999
<i>to right a terrible wrong.</i>

06:37.001 --> 06:40.903
<i>Twenty-one years ago,
this man was convicted</i>

06:40.905 --> 06:43.809
<i>and locked away for a crime
he didn't commit.</i>

06:44.475 --> 06:45.511
Write them again.

06:47.511 --> 06:49.148
They already
turned me down, Mom.

06:50.982 --> 06:53.419
This time don't tell them
about your case.

06:54.585 --> 06:55.821
Tell them about you.

06:57.588 --> 06:58.890
Tell them who you are.

07:12.837 --> 07:14.439
<i>Dear Mr. Brooks,</i>

07:15.105 --> 07:17.139
<i>I am writing you again
in the hope</i>

07:17.141 --> 07:21.112
<i>that the California Innocence
Project will reconsider my case.</i>

07:22.112 --> 07:24.713
<i>I know you hear
from a lot of people,</i>

07:24.715 --> 07:29.117
<i>but maybe if you got to know
me, you might reconsider.</i>

07:29.119 --> 07:33.525
<i>Let me state, clearly and
unequivocally, I am innocent.</i>

07:34.525 --> 07:38.727
<i>I spent six years in prison
and the past three on parole</i>

07:38.729 --> 07:41.797
<i>for a sex offense
that I did not commit.</i>

07:41.799 --> 07:46.472
<i>I wrote you two years ago from
CMC and you turned me down.</i>

07:47.138 --> 07:50.075
<i>But I don't stay down.
Not for long.</i>

07:50.741 --> 07:52.275
<i>I learned that in prison</i>

07:52.277 --> 07:54.479
<i>and I learned it
growing up, too.</i>

07:55.746 --> 07:58.715
<i>You see, I played a lot of
football when I was young.</i>

07:58.717 --> 08:01.654
<i>And it wasn't all ice cream
and pizza parties.</i>

08:02.253 --> 08:03.489
<i>No, sir.</i>

08:04.022 --> 08:06.091
<i>I had a different walk home.</i>

08:07.258 --> 08:10.225
<i>Life in Long Beach was for real</i>

08:10.227 --> 08:12.129
<i>and it was hard
to see a way out.</i>

08:15.299 --> 08:17.634
<i>But football
gave me an option.</i>

08:17.636 --> 08:20.903
<i>It taught me discipline
and dedication,</i>

08:20.905 --> 08:23.908
<i>and strangely, it gave me faith.</i>

08:25.010 --> 08:28.047
<i>Because Mom said
my talent was God-given.</i>

08:28.914 --> 08:30.146
<i>So, each night,</i>

08:30.148 --> 08:32.650
<i>I promised to give
something back in return.</i>

08:34.085 --> 08:36.284
<i>By the time I was 16,</i>

08:36.287 --> 08:39.856
<i>I wasn't just your average
high school football player.</i>

08:39.857 --> 08:42.924
<i>I was what they called a sure thing.</i>

08:42.927 --> 08:45.160
<i>All-American
Brian Banks with the tackle!</i>

08:45.162 --> 08:47.329
<i>Brutal hit by Brian Banks,</i>

08:47.331 --> 08:49.064
<i>all the way up here
in the press box.</i>

08:49.066 --> 08:50.632
<i>I played middle linebacker</i>

08:50.634 --> 08:53.069
<i>on one of the best teams
in the country.</i>

08:53.071 --> 08:55.804
<i>We had 2,000 fans at every game.</i>

08:55.806 --> 08:58.808
<i>But to be honest,
I only heard one.</i>

08:58.810 --> 09:00.809
Yay! That's my baby!

09:00.811 --> 09:03.246
<i>The sky's the limit for this kid.</i>

09:03.248 --> 09:05.048
<i>Even though
I was just a sophomore,</i>

09:05.050 --> 09:07.083
<i>I had the attention
of the media...</i>

09:07.085 --> 09:10.118
Big game coming up, Brian.
Remember, we're doing that feature on you.

09:10.120 --> 09:11.788
You'll call me, right?

09:11.790 --> 09:13.289
- Oh, yes, sir.
- Great game.

09:13.291 --> 09:15.223
<i>...and the best coach
in college football...</i>

09:15.225 --> 09:17.327
- Who's up?
- Hey, Coach Carroll.

09:17.329 --> 09:19.194
- Brian!
- <i>...Coach Pete Carroll of USC.</i>

09:19.196 --> 09:20.762
Good to see you, man.

09:20.764 --> 09:22.966
Just reviewed the tape on you
from last season.

09:22.968 --> 09:24.700
- Amazing!
- Aw, thanks, Coach.

09:24.702 --> 09:26.368
Can't wait to see
what you bring today.

09:26.370 --> 09:28.771
We do this right, we're not just
talking about the Rose Bowl.

09:28.773 --> 09:30.939
We're talking NFL
and a lifetime of opportunities.

09:30.941 --> 09:33.175
<i>Coach Carroll was
someone I looked up to,</i>

09:33.177 --> 09:35.980
<i>and his belief in me
made a world of difference.</i>

09:37.215 --> 09:38.651
What does it say?

09:39.149 --> 09:41.150
- USC.
- Huh?

09:41.152 --> 09:42.888
- It says USC.
- Yeah!

09:45.123 --> 09:48.127
<i>But all that changed
on July 8, 2002.</i>

09:49.694 --> 09:52.731
<i>You know that feeling you get
that tells you something is off?</i>

09:53.864 --> 09:55.633
<i>Some say it's the voice of God.</i>

09:57.268 --> 10:00.138
<i>Had I listened to that voice,
we might not be here today.</i>

10:02.139 --> 10:03.575
<i>But I didn't.</i>

10:04.142 --> 10:05.643
<i>And here we are.</i>

10:17.422 --> 10:19.057
Wait, wait, hold up, hold up.

10:22.226 --> 10:24.426
- Yeah?
- Pack it up. Get out of there.

10:24.428 --> 10:26.429
- I'm not done with the job yet.
- <i>No, you are done.</i>

10:26.431 --> 10:29.165
The monitor says that
you're at Pomona fairgrounds.

10:29.167 --> 10:31.767
"Fair" and "sex offender"
do not go together, Banks.

10:31.769 --> 10:34.270
Sir, we're only here
for a couple more hours.

10:34.272 --> 10:36.104
You know how long
it took me to get this job?

10:36.106 --> 10:38.440
- If I leave now, I'll get fired.
- <i>Yeah, if you don't leave now,</i>

10:38.442 --> 10:40.776
might as well drive yourself
straight to County.

10:40.778 --> 10:43.414
<i>Pack it up.
Get your ass out of there.</i>

10:50.088 --> 10:53.192
<i>All right, so I'm innocent.
What are my options?</i>

10:53.758 --> 10:55.091
Anybody?

10:55.093 --> 10:56.395
Come on, what are my options?

10:57.228 --> 10:59.328
- Yes.
- Take it to the Supreme Court?

10:59.330 --> 11:01.296
No. You have
no Constitutional right

11:01.298 --> 11:03.198
to take it to the Supreme Court,
even if you're innocent.

11:03.200 --> 11:05.801
The best you can do
is take it to the state level.

11:05.803 --> 11:07.804
And good luck with that
in California.

11:07.806 --> 11:10.806
Because? I'm gonna keep
telling you guys this.

11:10.808 --> 11:14.477
It is almost impossible to overturn
a conviction here in California.

11:14.479 --> 11:17.413
We make those people out in Alabama
look like a bunch of liberals.

11:17.415 --> 11:19.181
I quote:

11:19.183 --> 11:22.751
"New evidence must completely
undermine the prosecution's case

11:22.753 --> 11:25.758
and point unerringly
to innocence."

11:26.090 --> 11:27.155
All right?

11:27.157 --> 11:28.859
That's it for today. Thanks.

11:32.931 --> 11:35.931
- Mr. Brooks, I'm Brian Banks.
- Oh, hey, Brian.

11:35.933 --> 11:38.300
Yeah, you're the football
player, right?

11:38.302 --> 11:40.001
You got my letter.

11:40.003 --> 11:42.338
I got your letters.
Plural, right?

11:42.340 --> 11:45.440
Look, Brian, I know
Alissa explained to you,

11:45.442 --> 11:47.876
we only work with
wrongly imprisoned people.

11:47.878 --> 11:49.878
- I was wrongly imprisoned.
- I know. I know.

11:49.880 --> 11:52.115
But you're out now. Okay?

11:52.117 --> 11:54.117
It's a good thing.
And you took a plea.

11:54.119 --> 11:56.251
- I only took a plea because I was...
- You don't have to explain.

11:56.253 --> 11:59.387
It's okay. It's okay.
97% of all cases plead out.

11:59.389 --> 12:04.459
But you didn't go to trial, so you can't
appeal. There's nothing you can do.

12:04.461 --> 12:06.395
There's always
something you can do.

12:06.397 --> 12:09.198
- You can file a habeas petition.
- A what?

12:09.200 --> 12:11.000
It's a writ of habeas corpus.

12:11.002 --> 12:13.169
You challenge the conviction
based on new evidence.

12:13.171 --> 12:15.438
But if you were paying attention in
there, you heard me.

12:15.440 --> 12:17.272
It's gotta be
damn good evidence.

12:17.274 --> 12:18.808
All right? I gotta go.

12:18.810 --> 12:20.843
Let me tell you
about my DNA evidence.

12:20.845 --> 12:23.545
Which you had at the time, right?
You didn't use it.

12:23.547 --> 12:26.314
That's what I'm trying to tell you, Brian.
You need something new.

12:26.316 --> 12:28.517
New piece of evidence.
A new witness

12:28.519 --> 12:30.886
who can place you somewhere else
at the time of the incident,

12:30.888 --> 12:33.021
or a recantation
by the complainant.

12:33.023 --> 12:36.858
- What's that?
- Well, basically, the girl would have to say you didn't do it.

12:36.860 --> 12:38.961
Come on, man.
I go anywhere near that girl,

12:38.963 --> 12:40.896
they're gonna put me
right back in prison.

12:40.898 --> 12:42.330
There ain't no way
that girl gonna flip.

12:42.332 --> 12:43.901
She got paid
a million and a half bucks.

12:45.036 --> 12:46.569
She what?

12:46.571 --> 12:49.805
Her and her mom sued the school
district for lack of security.

12:49.807 --> 12:51.176
They got 1.5.

12:54.111 --> 12:55.410
All right.
Well, look, Brian,

12:55.412 --> 12:57.579
I've got clients,
innocent people.

12:57.581 --> 13:00.916
They've been locked up
20, 30 years.

13:00.918 --> 13:03.586
They'd love to be able to take
a nice drive to San Diego.

13:03.588 --> 13:06.421
The criminal justice system
is messed up.

13:06.423 --> 13:08.958
It's supposed to be innocent
until proven guilty.

13:08.960 --> 13:11.430
A lot of cases,
it's the exact opposite.

13:12.196 --> 13:13.931
It sounds like yours included.

13:14.932 --> 13:15.967
I'm sorry.

13:18.369 --> 13:20.004
What's that thing called again?

13:20.939 --> 13:21.974
A writ of what?

13:23.173 --> 13:24.542
Habeas corpus.

14:03.981 --> 14:05.381
Hey, Corey, look, man,

14:05.383 --> 14:07.250
I really appreciate
what you're trying to do,

14:07.252 --> 14:10.386
but I ain't gonna be surprised if
the owner's got a problem with this.

14:10.388 --> 14:13.122
Brian, I've known you
since we were kids.

14:13.124 --> 14:16.025
I'm gonna talk to the owner,
let him know you're a straight-up dude,

14:16.027 --> 14:18.327
and that he has nothing to worry about.
Because he doesn't.

14:18.329 --> 14:20.228
- All right. Thanks, man.
- I got you.

14:20.230 --> 14:21.329
It means the world, all right?

14:21.331 --> 14:23.431
Hey, Karina,
come here for a sec.

14:23.433 --> 14:25.534
I want to introduce you
to my man Brian.

14:25.536 --> 14:27.270
He's gonna be
working here soon.

14:27.272 --> 14:28.670
Great. Nice to meet you.

14:28.672 --> 14:30.506
Let me tell you something
about this dude.

14:30.508 --> 14:34.010
Back in the day,
baddest football player ever.

14:34.012 --> 14:35.414
Yeah. I'm telling you.

14:36.013 --> 14:37.148
You don't play anymore?

14:37.949 --> 14:39.649
Uh, I'm not in playing shape
right now.

14:39.651 --> 14:41.250
Karina could help you
with that.

14:41.252 --> 14:43.519
This girl right here is fierce.

14:43.521 --> 14:45.521
Get you back in tip-top shape
in no time.

14:45.523 --> 14:47.622
So, listen,
I'm gonna call you in a few days.

14:47.624 --> 14:50.025
All right. Thanks again.

14:50.027 --> 14:51.864
- Really.
- No problem, man. I got you.

14:53.364 --> 14:56.165
Corey's great.
Treats people really well.

14:56.167 --> 14:58.700
Oh, he's stepping out for me,
that's for sure.

14:58.702 --> 15:01.270
So, are you gonna work out?

15:01.272 --> 15:02.538
Uh, I'm thinking about it.

15:02.540 --> 15:04.306
Corey said it was cool,
so, you know.

15:04.308 --> 15:06.242
Well, I can train you
if you want.

15:06.244 --> 15:09.712
Oh, wow, look, uh,
that's really generous. Thank you.

15:09.714 --> 15:11.948
But things have been kind of
tight for me lately, so...

15:11.950 --> 15:13.315
No problem.

15:13.317 --> 15:16.153
First session
is complimentary. Really.

15:16.720 --> 15:18.890
Come on.
Let's see what you got.

15:21.124 --> 15:23.595
Push it. Nice. Arch the back.

15:24.494 --> 15:27.295
Four, three, five... six.

15:27.297 --> 15:28.600
Both arms.

15:29.433 --> 15:30.935
Both arms.

15:32.637 --> 15:35.474
And rest. Nice.

15:35.739 --> 15:36.975
Yeah.

15:39.543 --> 15:41.479
- Hey, let's go.
- Yeah, in a minute.

15:44.382 --> 15:48.049
Nice. Nice. Nice. Okay.

15:48.051 --> 15:50.489
Pump those knees.
Stick the landing.

15:51.723 --> 15:52.991
Give me ten.

15:54.191 --> 15:55.927
Okay.

16:01.766 --> 16:05.133
So, I... I wanted to get
my masters, but, uh...

16:05.135 --> 16:08.673
I have so many student loans
that I just thought,

16:09.507 --> 16:12.341
you know,
why not take a break, work,

16:12.343 --> 16:14.543
chip away
at some of that debt.

16:14.545 --> 16:17.413
And before I knew it,
two years turned into five

16:17.415 --> 16:20.051
and still not in grad school,
but...

16:20.518 --> 16:22.019
So, what you studying?

16:22.652 --> 16:24.252
I majored in art.

16:24.254 --> 16:27.122
What? That's cool.

16:27.124 --> 16:30.492
Anyway, Columbia is the dream
for grad school.

16:30.494 --> 16:32.060
So, fingers crossed.

16:32.062 --> 16:34.398
Hey. Got them crossed.

16:36.133 --> 16:37.532
Anyway, what about you?

16:37.534 --> 16:40.102
You used to be
a football player.

16:40.104 --> 16:41.237
Yeah.

16:41.239 --> 16:42.975
But you don't play anymore?

16:43.374 --> 16:44.542
I'm hoping to.

16:45.343 --> 16:47.112
What happened?
Why don't you play?

16:48.812 --> 16:53.718
Okay, Karina, look,
if we're gonna hang out, be friends,

16:55.152 --> 16:57.422
there's something
I gotta tell you.

16:58.422 --> 16:59.657
Okay.

17:04.295 --> 17:06.127
When I was 16,

17:06.128 --> 17:08.465
I was accused
of something I didn't do.

17:09.634 --> 17:11.634
Now, this is back
in high school.

17:11.636 --> 17:14.169
You know,
I was on my way to USC,

17:14.171 --> 17:17.173
full ride, football,
everything, right?

17:17.175 --> 17:21.445
This young lady
falsely accused me...

17:32.456 --> 17:36.194
I've just been working to get my life back.
Clear my name.

17:39.296 --> 17:40.598
- Uh...
- Yeah.

17:41.264 --> 17:42.566
I, uh...

17:44.734 --> 17:46.734
I have to go back to work.

17:46.736 --> 17:49.538
- I'm sorry. Let me...
- Yeah. No, I mean, it's your job.

17:49.540 --> 17:51.706
I'll give...
I'll give you something.

17:51.708 --> 17:54.676
No, don't worry about it.
I got it.

17:54.678 --> 17:56.712
- I got... Yeah.
- I'll see you at the gym. Okay?

17:56.714 --> 17:59.216
It's okay. It's okay. Yeah.

18:09.627 --> 18:11.062
Mom.

18:12.496 --> 18:13.664
Mom!

18:56.907 --> 19:00.212
<i>Your assignment
this week is to copy this,</i>

19:01.478 --> 19:02.845
<i>and tape it to your cell wall</i>

19:02.847 --> 19:05.783
<i>where you can see it
morning, noon and night.</i>

19:06.850 --> 19:09.753
This circle is your life.

19:10.588 --> 19:13.692
And the goal
is to travel this circle

19:14.559 --> 19:17.696
until you get back
to who you are.

19:18.628 --> 19:22.300
Now, most people never make it
because of this.

19:25.336 --> 19:28.236
In here are distractions.

19:28.238 --> 19:31.706
You gotta have more.
You gotta make more.

19:31.708 --> 19:34.409
You gotta keep up
with the Joneses.

19:34.411 --> 19:36.678
But you gentlemen
have been given a gift.

19:36.680 --> 19:40.619
You've been removed
from these distractions.

19:41.351 --> 19:42.353
You can't get more.

19:42.852 --> 19:44.188
You can't make more.

19:44.789 --> 19:46.358
Given the right perspective,

19:46.890 --> 19:48.726
prison can set you free,

19:49.593 --> 19:53.931
and your despair
can become a doorway.

19:55.565 --> 19:57.700
<i>Use that despair</i>

19:57.702 --> 20:02.607
<i>and never give up
on what lives within you.</i>

20:08.612 --> 20:10.713
<i>California Innocence Project.</i>

20:10.715 --> 20:14.753
Hi. This is Brian Banks.
May I please speak to Alissa Bjerkhoel?

20:15.753 --> 20:17.720
It's Brian Banks again.

20:17.722 --> 20:18.988
You want to take it
or you want me to?

20:18.990 --> 20:20.588
No, no, no.
I got it. I got it.

20:20.590 --> 20:21.859
Okay.

20:25.629 --> 20:27.299
Brian.

20:27.831 --> 20:30.031
Hey, I saw
your habeas petition.

20:30.033 --> 20:32.501
You can't just put us down
as your attorneys, Brian.

20:32.503 --> 20:35.303
I had to put somebody down just
in case they gave me a hearing.

20:35.305 --> 20:37.306
- Which they're not gonna do because...
- <i>Yeah, I know.</i>

20:37.308 --> 20:39.407
They sent me a copy of this.
I tried to tell you.

20:39.409 --> 20:41.909
- You need some new evidence.
- <i>So help me find some.</i>

20:41.911 --> 20:44.346
It's out there. It's gotta be,
'cause I'm innocent.

20:44.348 --> 20:47.683
I've had prisoners put together
their own habeas petitions before.

20:47.685 --> 20:49.354
Never very good.

20:49.686 --> 20:51.686
But this is...

20:51.688 --> 20:54.658
Guys, I see you hiding out there.
Why don't you just come on in?

20:55.926 --> 20:57.592
You sure you didn't have
any help with this?

20:57.594 --> 20:58.862
You didn't get me any,
remember?

21:00.063 --> 21:03.531
Right. Well, you got a real
fan club up here, Brian.

21:03.533 --> 21:07.403
I'm gonna have a mutiny on my
hands unless we do something.

21:07.405 --> 21:10.938
So, Marilyn and Alissa are
gonna head up to Los Angeles,

21:10.940 --> 21:12.907
ask you a few questions,
all right?

21:12.909 --> 21:15.647
Meanwhile, I don't want you
to go outside county lines.

21:16.480 --> 21:18.414
Does that mean
you're taking on my case?

21:18.416 --> 21:20.482
No. It doesn't mean that.

21:20.484 --> 21:22.951
In fact, I'm hesitant to even
have this conversation with you

21:22.953 --> 21:25.553
for fear that I'm gonna
get your hopes up.

21:25.555 --> 21:29.090
But if we have an inkling
that we can help somebody out,

21:29.092 --> 21:31.428
we try and at least grant them
an interview.

21:32.629 --> 21:33.729
So you have an inkling.

21:33.731 --> 21:35.597
No, I didn't say that.

21:35.599 --> 21:37.366
- You just did.
- You definitely did.

21:37.368 --> 21:39.635
- No, I said "if" I have an inkling.
- <i>Inkling.</i>

21:39.637 --> 21:42.538
<i>A slight knowledge, hint or suspicion.
Middle English origin.</i>

21:42.540 --> 21:44.973
I read the dictionary twice when
I was in prison, Mr. Brooks.

21:44.975 --> 21:46.577
We gotta go, Brian.

21:48.079 --> 21:50.948
- Happy?
- Come on. Let's go.

21:55.119 --> 21:58.455
So, is it okay
if we record you?

21:59.557 --> 22:01.459
- Absolutely.
- Okay.

22:02.959 --> 22:05.462
Now we need you to walk us
through the incident.

22:06.129 --> 22:07.998
Can you tell us
what happened that day?

22:09.867 --> 22:12.470
I just left history class.

22:13.137 --> 22:15.473
I was gonna call
this reporter.

22:17.006 --> 22:19.808
<i>This is Mike. Leave a message.</i>

22:19.810 --> 22:21.876
Hey, Mr. Paley,
it's Brian Banks.

22:21.878 --> 22:25.015
Um... Guess I'll just
try you after school.

22:26.783 --> 22:28.485
<i>Her name was Kennisha Rice.</i>

22:30.620 --> 22:34.492
<i>I knew her from middle school.
Her and her sister Ava.</i>

22:35.559 --> 22:38.029
Hey, Kennisha, what up?
What you doing?

22:38.763 --> 22:40.098
Bathroom.

22:40.764 --> 22:41.932
Bathroom that way.

22:42.733 --> 22:44.569
I was gonna go
to the 700 building.

22:45.503 --> 22:47.539
I mean, you want me
to walk with you?

22:48.406 --> 22:49.704
Okay.

22:49.706 --> 22:51.106
Okay.

22:51.108 --> 22:53.811
<i>The 700 building
was across campus.</i>

22:55.980 --> 22:58.983
<i>It had this place where
everybody went to make out.</i>

23:01.051 --> 23:02.821
<i>The whole school knew about it.</i>

23:03.553 --> 23:05.087
<i>That if you liked a girl</i>

23:05.089 --> 23:06.558
<i>and a girl liked you,</i>

23:07.957 --> 23:09.793
<i>you always ended up there.</i>

23:12.862 --> 23:14.532
<i>But it was tricky to get to.</i>

23:15.565 --> 23:17.665
<i>There was this long hallway,</i>

23:17.667 --> 23:20.104
<i>and you had to be really quiet.</i>

23:21.738 --> 23:23.106
<i>But if you made it through...</i>

23:24.041 --> 23:25.609
<i>...you were on your own.</i>

23:26.910 --> 23:28.078
<i>Usually.</i>

23:29.713 --> 23:31.416
What you trying to do?

23:31.849 --> 23:33.051
What's up?

23:37.754 --> 23:38.956
Mmm.

23:47.965 --> 23:51.136
<i>And then I was thinking,
"What are you doing?</i>

23:51.836 --> 23:53.501
If we get caught,

23:53.503 --> 23:55.703
then I get kicked out
of summer school,

23:55.705 --> 23:58.075
and that could mess up
the whole football season."

23:58.742 --> 24:00.478
So when I heard the teacher,

24:01.579 --> 24:02.946
I stopped.

24:04.615 --> 24:06.013
I stopped.

24:06.015 --> 24:08.852
Hey, look, I ain't really
feeling this no more, so...

24:09.719 --> 24:10.988
Um...

24:11.722 --> 24:13.021
You go out that way.

24:13.023 --> 24:15.459
I'm gonna go out that door.
All right?

24:16.961 --> 24:20.031
<i>There's just so many things
I could have said.</i>

24:21.264 --> 24:24.068
"I don't want you
to get in trouble," or...

24:25.101 --> 24:27.871
<i>"I just don't think this is
special enough of a place."</i>

24:32.076 --> 24:34.112
But I was 16.

24:36.146 --> 24:38.148
I wasn't grown-up enough.

24:41.784 --> 24:43.151
And to be honest,

24:43.153 --> 24:46.491
I just went back to class
and I forgot about it.

24:48.024 --> 24:49.325
But she didn't forget.

24:53.196 --> 24:55.099
<i>She went back to math class.</i>

24:55.933 --> 24:57.702
<i>Was with her friend Shayla.</i>

25:02.171 --> 25:04.141
<i>And that's where
it all went wrong.</i>

25:07.311 --> 25:10.114
<i>While she and her mom
were with the police,</i>

25:12.616 --> 25:13.685
<i>I was at home.</i>

25:16.020 --> 25:17.989
<i>I still remember my dream.</i>

25:21.658 --> 25:24.995
<i>It was that same feeling I had
when I was a kid.</i>

25:28.866 --> 25:30.734
<i>The feeling of being free.</i>

25:32.636 --> 25:34.336
Don't move! Let's go.

25:34.338 --> 25:36.104
- Put your hands behind your back.
- Wait, wait, wait.

25:36.106 --> 25:37.306
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

25:37.308 --> 25:39.107
- Shut up!
- But I ain't do nothing!

25:39.109 --> 25:41.609
- I didn't do nothing!
- Shut up!

25:41.611 --> 25:44.312
- Mom! Mom! Mom!
- Get him up! Get him up!

25:44.314 --> 25:47.348
- Get him out of here!
- Mom, I didn't do nothing!

25:47.350 --> 25:51.555
Where are you taking my son?
Brian! Brian!

25:53.823 --> 25:55.225
Brian!

25:56.694 --> 25:58.229
Brian!

25:59.830 --> 26:02.330
Brian's problem
is that he told the truth.

26:02.332 --> 26:04.098
Without legal counsel present,

26:04.100 --> 26:07.168
he admitted to being
in the stairwell with Kennisha,

26:07.170 --> 26:09.771
and the DA determined
there was probable cause.

26:09.773 --> 26:14.108
Two months later, Brian was removed from
juvenile court and tried as an adult.

26:14.110 --> 26:17.111
Two counts of felony rape
and one count of sodomy

26:17.113 --> 26:19.114
with an enhanced circumstance
of kidnapping.

26:19.116 --> 26:22.250
His mother had to sell their house and
their car to afford a new attorney.

26:22.252 --> 26:25.686
According to the record, every time
Kennisha told her story, it changed.

26:25.688 --> 26:29.090
And how did he drag her down a
hallway by a bunch of open classrooms

26:29.092 --> 26:30.892
- without being noticed?
- Exactly.

26:30.894 --> 26:33.261
Unfortunately, no one
ever visited the hallway.

26:33.263 --> 26:35.297
Not the attorneys,
not the investigators.

26:35.299 --> 26:37.633
- And the DNA evidence?
- It came back negative.

26:37.635 --> 26:40.702
Which supports Brian's
assertion they never had sex.

26:40.704 --> 26:43.741
So, why did he plea?
Did you ask him?

26:56.387 --> 26:58.419
I'm sorry, folks.
We need a 30-minute recess

26:58.421 --> 27:00.290
while I meet with counsel
in chambers.

27:10.967 --> 27:14.037
I got some good news.
I worked out a deal with the DA.

27:14.804 --> 27:16.370
They gonna drop the charges?

27:16.372 --> 27:18.406
Kidnapping and sodomy charges

27:18.408 --> 27:21.443
if you agree to plead no contest
to one count of rape.

27:21.445 --> 27:24.680
- What's no contest?
- It means you don't contest the charges.

27:24.682 --> 27:26.982
You don't plead guilty,
you don't plead not guilty.

27:26.984 --> 27:28.450
But I am not guilty.

27:28.452 --> 27:30.851
Brian, I have seen this
too many times.

27:30.853 --> 27:34.723
You admitted to some intimate
contact, so it comes down to consent.

27:34.725 --> 27:37.826
Who's the jury gonna believe?

27:37.828 --> 27:40.462
And did you see all those
white folks out there?

27:40.464 --> 27:43.898
All they see is a big black
teenager accused of rape.

27:43.900 --> 27:46.934
And if any of them end up on the
jury, they're gonna find you guilty.

27:46.936 --> 27:50.905
But if you take this deal,
you are almost guaranteed probation,

27:50.907 --> 27:52.943
and in three months' time,
you can be back to your family.

27:53.974 --> 27:56.280
Back to your life.
Back to playing football. You'd be free.

27:57.947 --> 28:01.185
Okay.
Can I talk to my mom about this?

28:01.851 --> 28:02.986
No, Brian.

28:03.753 --> 28:05.353
You've been charged
as an adult

28:05.355 --> 28:07.792
and you need to make
this decision yourself.

28:08.492 --> 28:10.492
And they've only given us
ten minutes to decide.

28:10.494 --> 28:13.095
- Ten minutes?
- Then the deal is off the table.

28:13.097 --> 28:15.230
You need to decide now.

28:15.232 --> 28:17.132
You wanna go home,
put this behind you,

28:17.134 --> 28:20.271
or do you want to risk your whole
life for something you didn't do?

28:22.071 --> 28:23.306
Ten minutes, Brian.

28:37.321 --> 28:41.790
So, Mr. Banks, it's my understanding
that you wish to enter a plea.

28:41.792 --> 28:43.261
Is that correct?

28:52.936 --> 28:55.103
Uh... Yes. Yes, sir.

28:55.105 --> 28:58.005
<i>Now, you understand
that a plea of no contest</i>

28:58.007 --> 29:00.744
<i>has the same legal effect
as a plea of guilty.</i>

29:01.544 --> 29:04.011
That you will be required
to register as a sex offender

29:04.013 --> 29:05.914
for the rest of your life.

29:05.916 --> 29:07.284
Do you understand that?

29:09.153 --> 29:10.888
Mr. Banks?

29:12.222 --> 29:13.925
Do you understand?

29:20.129 --> 29:21.933
Yes, sir.

29:22.331 --> 29:24.366
Brian Keith Banks,

29:24.368 --> 29:26.568
<i>on count one,</i>

29:26.570 --> 29:29.271
that you committed the crime
of forcible rape, a felony,

29:29.273 --> 29:30.440
how do you plead?

29:32.943 --> 29:35.012
No... No contest.

29:38.115 --> 29:39.183
Probation is denied.

29:42.051 --> 29:45.453
Defendant is to be imprisoned
for a total of six years,

29:45.455 --> 29:48.259
followed by five years
of supervised parole.

29:49.993 --> 29:52.260
No! No!

29:52.262 --> 29:53.895
- No, no, wait, wait.
- It's not right!

29:53.897 --> 29:55.329
- That's what you get.
- This isn't right!

29:55.331 --> 29:57.299
- Six years?
- My son is innocent...

29:57.301 --> 29:59.000
- No, hold... Wait. Mom!
- Brian!

29:59.002 --> 30:01.837
Mrs. Ford, you were supposed
to keep my son out of prison.

30:01.839 --> 30:05.072
You didn't say six...
You ain't say nothing about six years!

30:05.074 --> 30:06.407
- Mom! Mom!
- Brian!

30:06.409 --> 30:08.210
Now you about to pay
for raping my daughter.

30:08.212 --> 30:09.845
Hold on, wait a minute!
Wait a minute!

30:09.847 --> 30:13.250
My son is innocent!
My son is innocent!

30:14.451 --> 30:16.821
<i>My son is innocent!</i>

30:23.226 --> 30:27.261
Really good job, you guys. You laid out
the facts of the case really clearly.

30:27.263 --> 30:29.496
How does any of this help Brian?

30:29.498 --> 30:31.067
What about the DNA?

30:33.203 --> 30:36.637
I know. I know.
A lot of really bad stuff happened.

30:36.639 --> 30:39.307
Not to mention he got questionable
advice from his attorney.

30:39.309 --> 30:41.909
But they had the DNA evidence,
all right?

30:41.911 --> 30:44.212
And they didn't use it.
We can't either.

30:44.214 --> 30:46.248
Right?
There's nothing new here, guys.

30:46.250 --> 30:50.518
Alissa, Marilyn,
I sent you guys up to LA to dig around.

30:50.520 --> 30:54.623
- Did you find any new evidence that hasn't been submitted?
- There was never a trial.

30:54.625 --> 30:57.024
So there have to be witnesses
that weren't questioned.

30:57.026 --> 30:59.394
- We can find them and talk to them.
- And when are we gonna do that?

30:59.396 --> 31:02.664
Are we gonna take away time from cases
we have a legitimate chance of winning?

31:02.666 --> 31:05.232
The Johnson case is definitely gonna push.
I'll find the time.

31:05.234 --> 31:08.636
I got spring break coming up. I can
use my time to question a few people.

31:08.638 --> 31:11.005
- I've got time. I'm happy to help.
- Me too.

31:11.007 --> 31:12.674
- I'll help.
- I can. I definitely can help.

31:12.676 --> 31:16.347
He's innocent. We got this.

31:18.314 --> 31:19.883
This is your fault.

31:28.225 --> 31:29.426
This is Brian.

31:30.327 --> 31:32.027
Hey, Brian, it's Alissa.

31:32.029 --> 31:35.696
- Do you have your 2002 yearbook, by chance?
- Yeah.

31:35.698 --> 31:38.199
Okay, great. Do you think you
can identify some of the students

31:38.201 --> 31:40.135
you went to summer school with?

31:40.137 --> 31:41.304
Oh, yes, ma'am. Right away.

31:49.612 --> 31:51.512
<i>What's up?</i>

31:51.514 --> 31:53.650
Hey, yo, Eli, what's up, man?
It's B.

31:54.417 --> 31:56.020
Yeah, it's been a while, man.

32:03.459 --> 32:05.260
And then out of the blue,
Kennisha says,

32:05.262 --> 32:08.195
"Well, just so you know,
I wasn't even really raped.

32:08.197 --> 32:11.534
I only said that so my mom wouldn't
find out I was getting with boys."

32:12.668 --> 32:15.538
Shayla, would you be willing
to put all of this in writing?

32:16.173 --> 32:18.442
- Yeah.
- That's great.

32:25.482 --> 32:27.014
I'm sorry, man.

32:27.016 --> 32:28.619
Hey. You tried, man.

32:29.319 --> 32:30.521
You tried.

32:35.759 --> 32:36.994
Brian?

32:39.628 --> 32:42.465
How'd it go with Corey?
Did you get the job?

32:43.500 --> 32:45.500
Actually, the owner said no.

32:45.502 --> 32:47.234
But, uh...

32:47.236 --> 32:50.440
Corey, nah, he was great.
Really went to bat for me.

32:51.774 --> 32:56.243
- Listen, I'm... sorry about the other day. I...
- It's fine.

32:56.245 --> 32:58.713
Look, there's no good way to
tell a bad story. All right?

32:58.715 --> 33:01.715
And no matter how I tell it,

33:01.717 --> 33:04.519
people always gonna wonder
if I'm telling the truth, so...

33:04.521 --> 33:06.588
I'm not wondering anymore.

33:06.590 --> 33:08.155
Corey and I spoke,
and I know now

33:08.157 --> 33:10.461
that you didn't deserve
what happened to you.

33:13.463 --> 33:17.799
The other day, I hesitated when
I told you I was an art major.

33:17.801 --> 33:20.670
It's because whenever I say it,
people judge me.

33:22.138 --> 33:24.041
Brian, I judged you.

33:26.376 --> 33:27.677
And I am so sorry.

33:29.713 --> 33:31.682
In football, we used to say,

33:32.815 --> 33:35.685
"Spend too much time thinking
about the last play,

33:37.087 --> 33:38.656
you won't be ready
for the next one."

33:41.590 --> 33:43.426
So, you want to work out
with me?

33:44.427 --> 33:46.196
First session's complimentary.

33:52.168 --> 33:53.204
Brian?

33:55.539 --> 33:57.241
Well, I'm not gonna
work out in this.

33:58.841 --> 34:00.578
I'll be back
in five minutes.

34:01.578 --> 34:03.144
Five minutes.

34:03.146 --> 34:04.181
Don't lock me out.

34:10.853 --> 34:13.056
<i>♪ Yo, oh, whoa ♪</i>

Give it up for Justin!

34:52.596 --> 34:57.467
Thank you all, and don't let my
playing affect your donations.

34:59.469 --> 35:00.838
You're a man of many talents.

35:01.304 --> 35:02.871
Hey.

35:02.873 --> 35:05.206
Well, when I was younger,
I wanted to be a rock star.

35:05.208 --> 35:06.773
If I could have sung
worth a lick,

35:06.775 --> 35:08.442
never would have gone
to law school.

35:08.444 --> 35:10.478
Lucky for me,
you can't sing.

35:10.480 --> 35:11.815
Was it that bad?

35:12.415 --> 35:13.817
It was pretty bad.

35:15.585 --> 35:18.820
So, I'm guessing Alissa told
you how to find me tonight?

35:18.822 --> 35:20.855
If I say yes,
is she in trouble?

35:20.857 --> 35:23.657
Well, Alissa's always
in trouble.

35:23.659 --> 35:25.830
I happen to like that
about her.

35:29.866 --> 35:31.735
You got a little time
before your curfew?

35:32.435 --> 35:33.637
Yeah.

35:35.572 --> 35:36.607
Okay.

35:41.777 --> 35:43.545
Come on. Show me.

35:43.547 --> 35:45.346
I'm sorry, what happened?

35:45.348 --> 35:46.547
I think the table's slanted.

35:46.549 --> 35:48.315
Come ready!

35:48.317 --> 35:50.821
- I respect it. I respect it.
- Whoo!

35:54.324 --> 35:55.559
Pow.

35:56.592 --> 35:58.659
That's it? You giving up?

35:58.661 --> 35:59.897
I'm out of money.

36:00.630 --> 36:02.297
Hope you're happy.

36:02.299 --> 36:03.965
I'll be happy
when you represent me.

36:03.967 --> 36:05.632
Mmm.

36:05.634 --> 36:09.404
Brian, I want to help you.
I do.

36:09.406 --> 36:14.208
And in a perfect world,
you and I would just waltz into the court,

36:14.210 --> 36:17.844
you tell them what Shayla said
and they'd reopen your case.

36:17.846 --> 36:20.216
But that is not
the world we live in.

36:21.250 --> 36:23.817
The system is broken.
It's what I'm trying to tell you.

36:23.819 --> 36:25.221
It just doesn't care.

36:25.788 --> 36:27.554
I'm just supposed
to accept that,

36:27.556 --> 36:29.590
that the system is broken?

36:29.592 --> 36:30.860
Well, you know
what I say to that?

36:32.228 --> 36:33.230
Fuck the system.

36:34.331 --> 36:37.334
No, for real, man.
I mean, why can't we at least try?

36:37.967 --> 36:40.300
What is the system?
It's people.

36:40.302 --> 36:43.871
Yeah?
It's cops, lawyers, judges.

36:43.873 --> 36:46.241
If one of them
had just cared enough

36:46.243 --> 36:49.476
to even go down to that hallway
Kennisha said I dragged her,

36:49.478 --> 36:52.646
listened to how the tiniest
little noise echoes,

36:52.648 --> 36:55.219
I wouldn't have
this damn thing on my leg.

36:56.453 --> 36:57.755
- Mr. Brooks...
- Justin.

36:58.520 --> 36:59.723
Justin.

37:01.757 --> 37:04.525
I know the system
doesn't care about me.

37:04.527 --> 37:06.330
I've known that my whole life.

37:07.630 --> 37:09.333
The question is, do you?

37:16.038 --> 37:18.775
I carry three pictures
in my wallet.

37:19.375 --> 37:21.811
My, uh... My wife,

37:22.846 --> 37:26.447
my kids and, uh,
that one right there.

37:26.449 --> 37:27.882
That's her on the left.

37:27.884 --> 37:30.918
My longest-standing client,
Marilyn Mulero.

37:30.920 --> 37:33.987
One day I'm looking through
the newspaper and I see that

37:33.989 --> 37:37.794
Marilyn gets the death penalty
on a plea bargain.

37:38.795 --> 37:40.998
I'm wondering,
how's that even possible,

37:41.730 --> 37:43.399
to get death on a plea?

37:43.933 --> 37:45.335
Where's the bargain?

37:45.969 --> 37:47.934
So, I look into it.
Sure enough,

37:47.936 --> 37:50.741
this woman here,
she's the one that pulled the trigger.

37:51.907 --> 37:53.840
I find a couple of witnesses,

37:53.842 --> 37:56.246
I find a mountain
of evidence,

37:57.080 --> 37:58.415
and I lose.

37:59.683 --> 38:00.951
Eighteen years.

38:01.817 --> 38:03.686
With new evidence.

38:04.888 --> 38:06.824
Marilyn's still behind bars.

38:07.956 --> 38:09.690
She's the reason
I started the CIP

38:09.692 --> 38:11.828
and I'm not giving up
until she's free.

38:14.797 --> 38:17.065
So, yeah,
I can be a little jaded.

38:17.067 --> 38:20.436
But every once in a while,
we win.

38:21.904 --> 38:23.339
And it's amazing...

38:24.373 --> 38:25.973
seeing an innocent person
go free.

38:25.975 --> 38:28.608
And we do it because
we bust our asses

38:28.610 --> 38:29.980
and we know
what the system wants.

38:31.581 --> 38:33.350
Something extraordinary.

38:34.750 --> 38:37.351
You want me to be
your lawyer, Brian?

38:37.353 --> 38:39.753
We've already looked at your case,
talked to potential witnesses.

38:39.755 --> 38:44.027
I even called the parole board about
shortening your time. The well is dry.

38:45.362 --> 38:48.128
So let me tell you what I
need to argue your case.

38:48.130 --> 38:51.402
Not some piece of hearsay
evidence from ten years ago.

38:51.801 --> 38:53.469
I need something big.

38:55.371 --> 38:56.507
Earth-shattering.

38:58.375 --> 38:59.510
Extraordinary.

39:05.714 --> 39:06.883
Sorry.

39:52.862 --> 39:54.465
Just a reminder.

39:54.864 --> 39:56.100
You do have a family.

39:56.799 --> 39:58.000
Going soon.

39:58.735 --> 39:59.937
What is that?

40:01.170 --> 40:06.042
This is the hallway Brian
supposedly dragged that girl down.

40:06.676 --> 40:07.875
All the doors were open.

40:07.877 --> 40:09.643
I checked the school records.

40:09.645 --> 40:13.047
Classrooms were full of kids.
Ten separate classrooms.

40:13.049 --> 40:15.215
No way nobody
didn't hear something.

40:15.217 --> 40:18.186
Which gets rid of the
kidnapping charge right there.

40:18.188 --> 40:22.126
But that's still not enough
to reopen the case, is it?

40:23.125 --> 40:25.395
No, it's not.

40:27.831 --> 40:30.565
I don't understand, Justin.

40:30.567 --> 40:34.101
No, it's just...
It's something Brian said. It was, uh...

40:34.103 --> 40:36.003
I mean, we all know
the system's broken.

40:36.005 --> 40:38.105
Which is why
you started this place.

40:38.107 --> 40:41.541
I know, but I just don't
wanna ever stop trying

40:41.543 --> 40:44.547
because the system has
conditioned us to stop trying.

40:47.884 --> 40:49.086
Go home.

40:51.554 --> 40:53.891
Come on.
You visited this hallway.

40:54.723 --> 40:56.092
Go visit your family.

40:57.159 --> 40:58.494
Yeah.

41:03.632 --> 41:07.000
Since when did you become
interested in art museums?

41:07.002 --> 41:09.939
You remember that trainer
I told you about, Karina.

41:10.607 --> 41:11.708
So, she's an artist?

41:12.741 --> 41:16.580
Yeah. Yeah, she just sent me this.
Check it out.

41:19.781 --> 41:21.581
Baby, she painted this?

41:21.583 --> 41:22.919
Yup.

41:24.087 --> 41:25.820
So, you want to take her
to the museum?

41:25.822 --> 41:29.790
Just to thank her for all
the free training sessions.

41:29.792 --> 41:33.159
But there's some special
exhibit going on right now

41:33.161 --> 41:36.197
and the ticket prices are crazy.
I don't...

41:36.199 --> 41:37.935
Get the tickets, baby.

41:38.735 --> 41:40.034
Oh, Ma, come on.

41:40.036 --> 41:41.569
Look, I know
things are tight right now.

41:41.571 --> 41:43.938
I mean, barely made
the car payment last month.

41:43.940 --> 41:45.676
The car payment can wait.

41:46.643 --> 41:47.945
Your happiness can't.

41:54.918 --> 41:56.987
Brian, you deserve happiness.

41:57.853 --> 42:00.523
Not shame, not guilt.

42:01.290 --> 42:02.525
Happiness.

42:04.761 --> 42:05.963
Thanks, Mom.

42:06.328 --> 42:07.597
Oh...

42:08.665 --> 42:09.900
Thanks.

42:46.935 --> 42:48.636
What is it?

42:48.638 --> 42:51.708
Reminds me of something
someone taught me once.

43:00.917 --> 43:02.916
- Um, I gotta take this.
- Yeah.

43:02.918 --> 43:04.621
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

43:06.089 --> 43:08.822
- This is Brian.
- <i>What the hell are you doing, Banks?</i>

43:08.824 --> 43:10.391
2,000 feet, remember?

43:10.393 --> 43:12.596
- What?
- <i>Look out the window.</i>

43:13.096 --> 43:15.197
<i>Look out the goddamn window.</i>

43:17.634 --> 43:19.199
<i>Does that look like 2,000 feet?</i>

43:19.201 --> 43:20.936
<i>Get out of there now!</i>

43:24.741 --> 43:25.775
What the...

43:34.984 --> 43:36.252
Is everything okay?

43:38.654 --> 43:40.022
I can't be here.

43:41.690 --> 43:44.291
- Okay.
- I'm sorry, I should have checked.

43:44.293 --> 43:47.297
I just got so excited
with the art and, you know...

43:48.831 --> 43:53.804
But hey, I got a chance to
see your kind of art. Right?

43:55.038 --> 43:57.040
Would you mind
if I showed you mine?

43:59.074 --> 44:00.643
Okay.

44:02.078 --> 44:04.244
Yeah, okay. Yeah, let's go.

44:04.246 --> 44:05.882
- Okay.
- Yeah.

44:11.353 --> 44:15.922
Wow!
Brian, this is some canvas.

44:15.924 --> 44:20.126
I remember going to my first USC game when I was 15.

44:20.128 --> 44:22.029
I went with my mom
and my brother Brandon.

44:22.031 --> 44:23.898
I was sitting right up there.

44:23.900 --> 44:26.199
Section 6, seat 14.

44:26.201 --> 44:27.934
The best part
wasn't even the game.

44:27.936 --> 44:31.237
The best part was just
watching my mom be so happy

44:31.239 --> 44:32.808
because I was so happy.

44:35.210 --> 44:36.379
Hey, uh...

44:37.313 --> 44:39.750
I'm... I'm sorry about today,
Karina.

44:40.782 --> 44:43.884
I didn't even know what it
meant when I took that plea.

44:43.886 --> 44:47.690
All I knew was that I just didn't want
to spend the rest of my life in jail.

44:49.292 --> 44:51.828
My cousin went to prison.

44:53.763 --> 44:56.299
And when he came out,
he just wasn't the same.

44:58.034 --> 44:59.836
And you were what, 16?

45:01.136 --> 45:02.438
How did you survive it?

45:03.272 --> 45:04.674
Almost didn't.

45:05.373 --> 45:07.176
Especially in the beginning.

45:09.244 --> 45:12.715
Then I met a man
who showed me a different way,

45:14.116 --> 45:15.885
and everything changed.

45:17.286 --> 45:19.853
Two men look out
from prison bars.

45:19.855 --> 45:21.424
One saw mud,

45:22.424 --> 45:24.894
the other, the stars.

45:26.161 --> 45:27.763
Perspective, gentlemen.

45:28.498 --> 45:32.735
Perspective is the key
to how one fares in life.

45:35.138 --> 45:36.739
Mr. Banks, what do you think?

45:38.540 --> 45:40.876
I don't think none of
this shit apply to me.

45:42.145 --> 45:44.447
Then you need this class
more than most.

45:46.281 --> 45:47.484
Thank you, gentlemen.

45:54.956 --> 45:56.159
Mr. Banks.

45:57.159 --> 45:58.360
Brian.

46:01.130 --> 46:05.833
I know you think football
is the pathway to happiness.

46:05.835 --> 46:07.503
But on my life, son,

46:08.170 --> 46:10.239
I promise you that it is not.

46:11.206 --> 46:14.411
The path to happiness
begins and ends

46:15.177 --> 46:16.480
in the mind.

46:17.346 --> 46:18.982
Free your mind, Brian,

46:20.081 --> 46:21.884
and your ass will follow.

46:25.188 --> 46:26.490
<i>Before him,</i>

46:27.456 --> 46:29.793
<i>all I could think was, "Why me?"</i>

46:47.076 --> 46:48.344
All right, look.

46:49.946 --> 46:53.949
I don't know exactly
what it is you're going through,

46:55.418 --> 46:57.354
but you've got to let it go

46:58.221 --> 46:59.889
or it's gonna pull you down.

47:01.857 --> 47:06.159
How you got here may be wrong,
but the fact is, you are here.

47:06.161 --> 47:10.866
And before you leave this place
physically, you must leave it mentally,

47:12.400 --> 47:13.869
or you'll be back.

47:28.016 --> 47:29.252
This is for you.

47:32.087 --> 47:34.523
I might give you more books
from time to time.

47:35.391 --> 47:36.960
Books I hope you'll read.

47:58.281 --> 48:01.415
<i>I wish I could say
I got it from the start, but...</i>

48:01.417 --> 48:02.918
I was scared.

48:03.585 --> 48:05.552
Scared my life was over.

48:05.554 --> 48:10.556
Then this dude, doesn't know nothing
about me, he's talking about helping me?

48:10.558 --> 48:12.895
Was this the kind of help
that my lawyer gave me?

48:13.561 --> 48:15.364
So, yeah, I was skeptical.

48:17.299 --> 48:20.067
And right when I'm trying to
understand everything he's teaching me,

48:20.069 --> 48:21.371
I get transferred.

48:22.304 --> 48:23.572
Didn't see him again.

48:25.574 --> 48:28.345
That's when prison
had its own ideas.

49:02.444 --> 49:03.612
What's up, homie?

49:04.612 --> 49:06.049
You got a problem, bitch?

49:06.514 --> 49:08.551
No, I ain't got no problem.

49:10.185 --> 49:11.353
B87.

49:12.321 --> 49:13.523
Gate's open.

49:18.761 --> 49:23.400
<i>In prison,
it's the not knowing that gets to you.</i>

49:24.632 --> 49:27.303
<i>Not knowing what's on
the other side of a door.</i>

49:28.136 --> 49:31.139
<i>Not knowing
if you'll make it out alive.</i>

49:38.681 --> 49:41.248
What's up, homie?

49:41.250 --> 49:46.520
<i>Sometimes you gotta walk deeper
into the darkness to find the light.</i>

49:46.522 --> 49:50.157
Hey, Banks, get up!
Let's go! Up! Now!

49:50.159 --> 49:51.425
You broke his jaw, Banks.

49:51.427 --> 49:53.626
Don't you ever want
to get out of here?

49:53.628 --> 49:56.532
Sixty days. Think about it.

49:57.433 --> 49:59.235
<i>That was solitary for me.</i>

50:38.440 --> 50:40.176
I don't even feel you
no more, God.

50:41.576 --> 50:43.045
I can't feel you.

51:02.598 --> 51:05.168
Brian, we need you
back in the game.

51:14.743 --> 51:18.779
Hey, you think they give
a shit about you?

51:18.781 --> 51:21.815
About how twisted up
and pissed off you are?

51:21.817 --> 51:25.088
They don't even remember
your name. Shit.

51:39.368 --> 51:40.636
Brian.

51:44.406 --> 51:46.109
You've got to let it go.

51:47.375 --> 51:49.711
You've got to let it all go,

51:50.545 --> 51:52.549
or it's going
to pull you down.

51:53.882 --> 51:56.518
All you can control in life...

51:57.152 --> 51:58.253
This is for you.

52:04.560 --> 52:06.663
Is how you respond to life.

52:46.268 --> 52:47.400
<i>It's strange.</i>

52:47.402 --> 52:51.373
<i>I didn't see Mr. Johnson
after that first year in juvie.</i>

52:52.907 --> 52:54.911
But he's been with me
every day since.

53:02.351 --> 53:03.586
Listen, I...

53:04.786 --> 53:06.321
I want to be honest with you.

53:07.456 --> 53:08.591
I, um...

53:09.491 --> 53:11.594
I told you
I put off grad school,

53:13.395 --> 53:14.663
but I didn't say why.

53:16.864 --> 53:19.368
Why I reacted
when I heard your story.

53:23.871 --> 53:28.411
I... I didn't have the best
experience in college and...

53:29.344 --> 53:30.679
Um...

53:38.520 --> 53:39.722
Who was he?

53:42.690 --> 53:44.293
A friend...

53:45.460 --> 53:46.628
I thought.

53:48.397 --> 53:49.230
Uh...

53:50.699 --> 53:53.235
He said he couldn't
remember me saying no.

53:54.502 --> 53:56.939
Said I could have gotten
those bruises from anywhere.

53:59.407 --> 54:02.909
The cops were like,
"Sure you're not overreacting?"

54:02.911 --> 54:05.447
And when the school...

54:06.815 --> 54:08.217
did nothing...

54:09.351 --> 54:10.386
I left.

54:12.587 --> 54:13.790
I'm sorry.

54:16.525 --> 54:20.697
I... I don't even know how you can
hang with me after hearing my story.

54:25.734 --> 54:27.436
Well, I couldn't at first.

54:30.505 --> 54:32.274
But then I got to know you.

55:14.350 --> 55:16.418
No. Can't do that.

55:17.118 --> 55:18.387
Can't do that.

55:43.112 --> 55:45.811
<i>Here he comes,
and that'll be a first down.</i>

55:45.813 --> 55:50.483
<i>Whoo! That's the way to freaking
pass, baby! Yeah, baby!</i>

55:50.485 --> 55:52.886
<i>And Coach Pete
Carroll calls another time-out.</i>

55:52.888 --> 55:54.554
<i>I gotta tell you,</i>

55:54.556 --> 55:56.690
<i>when it comes to Coach Carroll,
there's no quit in him.</i>

55:56.692 --> 55:59.125
<i>The players believe in him,
they believe in the system.</i>

55:59.127 --> 56:01.027
<i>He brings a lot of energy
to the team.</i>

56:01.029 --> 56:03.896
<i>And I think Carroll coming on
to the Seahawks</i>

56:03.898 --> 56:05.835
<i>is the best decision
they could have made.</i>

56:27.822 --> 56:30.926
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

56:31.560 --> 56:32.862
Oh, shit.

56:59.955 --> 57:01.623
"Bygones be..."

57:57.545 --> 57:58.614
Hello?

58:00.014 --> 58:01.183
<i>Hello?</i>

58:02.583 --> 58:03.618
Kennisha?

58:04.652 --> 58:05.687
Hey.

58:08.924 --> 58:10.126
Hey.

58:12.261 --> 58:13.496
So, um...

58:15.297 --> 58:17.764
I... I guess I'm still wondering

58:17.766 --> 58:20.833
why you'd send me
a friend request like that.

58:20.835 --> 58:24.172
<i>Yeah. I wasn't even sure
you would answer.</i>

58:25.206 --> 58:28.978
So, I was just looking through
people I know from high school.

58:29.777 --> 58:31.647
I saw your page.

58:32.581 --> 58:33.649
And I was like,

58:34.750 --> 58:36.585
you look good.

58:37.953 --> 58:40.089
<i>But I was thinking
maybe we could,</i>

58:41.156 --> 58:44.927
I don't know,
hang out or something?

58:45.860 --> 58:47.529
Hang... Hang out?

58:48.697 --> 58:51.831
Can you understand why that
might seem a little weird to me

58:51.833 --> 58:53.101
that you'd want to do that?

58:54.136 --> 58:57.206
<i>I was in prison. I can't work.</i>

58:57.940 --> 58:59.672
<i>I can't play football.</i>

58:59.674 --> 59:02.275
Things have been pretty tough
for me, Kennisha.

59:02.277 --> 59:07.116
So, I guess that mean you
ain't trying to hang out, then?

59:10.819 --> 59:12.688
Uh, well...

59:16.023 --> 59:17.627
Well, maybe we could.

59:18.793 --> 59:19.960
<i>Yeah, maybe we could.</i>

59:19.962 --> 59:21.998
Truth is, I'm just stuck.

59:23.598 --> 59:26.101
And you're the only one
who can help me get unstuck.

59:27.168 --> 59:28.601
<i>I mean,
you're the only other one</i>

59:28.603 --> 59:30.603
<i>who knows what really happened.</i>

59:30.605 --> 59:32.308
<i>And if you did help me, then...</i>

59:33.241 --> 59:36.112
<i>we would never have to
talk about this stuff again.</i>

59:37.112 --> 59:38.548
All right, well...

59:39.313 --> 59:41.250
what is it you need me to do?

59:46.253 --> 59:49.688
Brian, if they find out you
went anywhere near that girl,

59:49.690 --> 59:51.593
they'll send you
right back to prison.

59:52.159 --> 59:53.826
That's why
nobody's gonna find out.

59:53.828 --> 59:56.329
Please, let's think
about this some more.

59:56.331 --> 59:58.632
You only have ten months left
on your parole.

59:58.634 --> 01:00:00.400
But I'm still gonna be
on that damn list.

01:00:00.402 --> 01:00:02.835
Nobody's gonna ever hire me
if I don't clear my name.

01:00:02.837 --> 01:00:05.070
- Well, then let the attorneys handle this.
- My attorneys... What...

01:00:05.072 --> 01:00:09.742
What attorneys, Ma? Who? The CIP?
I ain't heard from them in weeks.

01:00:09.744 --> 01:00:12.911
Besides, Kennisha already said she
ain't going nowhere near a lawyer.

01:00:12.913 --> 01:00:16.049
The only person she agreed
to talk to is Corey's friend.

01:00:16.051 --> 01:00:18.018
You remember Corey
from the gym.

01:00:18.020 --> 01:00:20.020
So, look, he's got a friend.

01:00:20.022 --> 01:00:21.221
Been selling insurance
for a little bit,

01:00:21.223 --> 01:00:22.755
but he's starting up
his own PI firm.

01:00:22.757 --> 01:00:24.924
So we all got together,
we got a plan.

01:00:24.926 --> 01:00:26.226
Trust me. We got a plan.

01:00:26.228 --> 01:00:28.027
An insurance agent, Brian?

01:00:28.029 --> 01:00:29.195
Mom, Mom.

01:00:29.197 --> 01:00:31.264
Sometimes things come your way

01:00:31.266 --> 01:00:32.998
and you have to act on them
right then and there

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.336
or else you won't have
another chance.

01:00:37.038 --> 01:00:38.340
This is my chance.

01:00:39.775 --> 01:00:40.843
Okay?

01:00:57.759 --> 01:00:58.828
Brian.

01:01:09.705 --> 01:01:10.538
Hey.

01:01:12.107 --> 01:01:14.840
I wasn't sure
if this was the right place.

01:01:14.842 --> 01:01:15.978
You found it.

01:01:16.478 --> 01:01:18.311
I was nervous about coming.

01:01:18.313 --> 01:01:20.416
Yeah, shit, I've been
kind of nervous myself.

01:01:21.382 --> 01:01:23.315
Did I tell you
I got three little ones now?

01:01:23.317 --> 01:01:24.918
Oh, you got three kids?

01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:27.487
Yeah. But it's some drama
going on with all that.

01:01:27.489 --> 01:01:29.956
So that's why I told you I don't
want to talk to no lawyers.

01:01:29.958 --> 01:01:33.293
Oh, no, this guy's not...
He's not a lawyer.

01:01:33.295 --> 01:01:35.697
He's more like an adviser.
So...

01:01:39.067 --> 01:01:40.835
- So, Ms. Reed...
- Rice.

01:01:41.969 --> 01:01:44.170
Oh, I'm sorry. Ms. Rice,

01:01:44.172 --> 01:01:48.241
I understand from Brian there are some
things that you guys wanted to discuss?

01:01:48.243 --> 01:01:50.110
Yeah. Uh...

01:01:50.112 --> 01:01:53.849
Well, we wanted to talk to you
about what happened in 2002.

01:01:54.782 --> 01:01:59.119
Okay. Uh, Ms. Rice,
is that what you want to do?

01:01:59.121 --> 01:02:03.389
I guess so. I mean,
Brian ain't playing in the NFL right now,

01:02:03.391 --> 01:02:04.860
I guess that's 'cause of me.

01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:06.992
So, you want to help him.

01:02:06.994 --> 01:02:10.829
Well, I can't do nothing where I gotta, like,
pay back none of the money or anything.

01:02:10.831 --> 01:02:13.132
I mean,
that would take a long time.

01:02:13.134 --> 01:02:14.867
Okay, and I understand.

01:02:14.869 --> 01:02:17.137
Look, this is just
for my own education

01:02:17.139 --> 01:02:19.773
so that I can... offer advice.

01:02:19.775 --> 01:02:21.141
Now,

01:02:21.143 --> 01:02:24.511
take me back
to the incident in 2002

01:02:24.513 --> 01:02:26.482
and just tell me how you see it.

01:02:27.382 --> 01:02:29.215
Um...

01:02:29.217 --> 01:02:31.851
Well, I guess
the way I look at it is,

01:02:31.853 --> 01:02:34.154
we was just being young.

01:02:34.156 --> 01:02:35.855
Curious about things.

01:02:35.857 --> 01:02:41.027
Okay, so you're saying
that he never raped you?

01:02:41.029 --> 01:02:42.494
I don't like using that word.

01:02:42.496 --> 01:02:44.931
Well, then tell me
what happened.

01:02:44.933 --> 01:02:49.034
Well, after we was down there and he
went out the door and I went my way,

01:02:49.036 --> 01:02:50.969
there was this security guard.

01:02:50.971 --> 01:02:52.040
Hey!

01:02:52.574 --> 01:02:55.541
You know I saw you
with that boy.

01:02:55.543 --> 01:02:57.811
Y'all went in the 700
building, didn't you?

01:02:57.813 --> 01:03:00.079
I know what you kids
do in there.

01:03:00.081 --> 01:03:01.447
Yeah, well, it wasn't my idea.

01:03:01.449 --> 01:03:02.982
- Whose was it?
- His.

01:03:02.984 --> 01:03:06.152
Oh! So, you're saying
he made you go in there?

01:03:06.154 --> 01:03:07.389
Made you do stuff?

01:03:08.956 --> 01:03:11.391
So, if that's true,
you're saying he raped you.

01:03:11.393 --> 01:03:12.862
Is that what you're saying?

01:03:14.029 --> 01:03:16.295
So, I wasn't the first person
to use that word.

01:03:16.297 --> 01:03:18.197
Uh, so the security guard
said it first?

01:03:18.199 --> 01:03:21.067
And then you wrote it down on a piece
of paper and gave it to your friend?

01:03:21.069 --> 01:03:22.235
Mm-hmm.

01:03:22.237 --> 01:03:25.471
Okay. Did you tell
any of these people

01:03:25.473 --> 01:03:27.873
that you and Brian were just
kissing and heavy petting

01:03:27.875 --> 01:03:29.976
and that you didn't
actually have sex?

01:03:29.978 --> 01:03:32.545
Nobody was listening
to anything I had to say.

01:03:32.547 --> 01:03:36.949
I mean, my attorney was like, "Just don't
say nothing. Like, don't talk at all.

01:03:36.951 --> 01:03:38.486
Just let them do
what they're gonna do."

01:03:39.087 --> 01:03:40.956
Okay, so, to be clear...

01:03:42.056 --> 01:03:43.993
Brian never raped you?

01:03:48.330 --> 01:03:49.965
No, he did not rape me.

01:03:54.902 --> 01:03:56.237
Did he kidnap you?

01:03:57.239 --> 01:03:58.507
Never.

01:04:03.978 --> 01:04:04.980
Alissa.

01:04:08.650 --> 01:04:12.317
<i>To be clear,
Brian never raped you?</i>

01:04:12.319 --> 01:04:13.988
<i>No, he did not rape me.</i>

01:04:15.489 --> 01:04:16.926
<i>Did he kidnap you?</i>

01:04:17.292 --> 01:04:18.560
<i>Never.</i>

01:04:25.366 --> 01:04:26.532
Amazing.

01:04:26.534 --> 01:04:29.003
A full recantation on tape.

01:04:32.139 --> 01:04:35.944
So, and she knew, right?
This guy told her she was being taped?

01:04:36.677 --> 01:04:38.311
Uh, no.

01:04:38.313 --> 01:04:41.346
No. No, but...
he did have a sign on the wall

01:04:41.348 --> 01:04:43.017
that said
the room was being monitored.

01:04:47.087 --> 01:04:48.389
A sign on the wall,

01:04:49.223 --> 01:04:50.426
that's it?

01:04:51.927 --> 01:04:53.162
Justin.

01:04:54.328 --> 01:04:56.529
This is what you said I needed.
Something extraordinary.

01:04:56.531 --> 01:05:00.699
This is what I brought you. Kennisha
telling the truth. She's telling the truth.

01:05:00.701 --> 01:05:03.001
It's amazing, Brian.

01:05:03.003 --> 01:05:04.406
It really is. I've...

01:05:05.306 --> 01:05:07.042
I've never seen
anything like it.

01:05:08.009 --> 01:05:09.043
But it's also...

01:05:09.444 --> 01:05:10.646
It's inadmissible.

01:05:13.214 --> 01:05:14.583
You can't use it.

01:05:15.583 --> 01:05:18.150
You can't record somebody
in the State of California

01:05:18.152 --> 01:05:19.621
without their explicit consent.

01:05:20.455 --> 01:05:22.587
Come on.
We got her sitting there

01:05:22.589 --> 01:05:24.389
right on tape,
telling the truth.

01:05:24.391 --> 01:05:26.224
You're telling me
I can't show anybody?

01:05:26.226 --> 01:05:27.492
What do you think
the chances are

01:05:27.494 --> 01:05:29.661
of getting her to say it again
on the record?

01:05:29.663 --> 01:05:32.065
No chance!
PI already scared her off

01:05:32.067 --> 01:05:34.166
by trying to get her
to sign something at the end.

01:05:34.168 --> 01:05:36.536
Once she knows she perjured
herself and could lose the money,

01:05:36.538 --> 01:05:38.670
she's gonna recant
her recantation.

01:05:38.672 --> 01:05:39.438
Yeah.

01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:42.608
Brian, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I...

01:05:42.610 --> 01:05:45.478
I wish you'd have called us
before you reached out.

01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:47.045
You wish
I would have called you?

01:05:47.047 --> 01:05:49.114
You wish
I would have called you?

01:05:49.116 --> 01:05:51.116
You know why
I didn't call you, Justin?

01:05:51.118 --> 01:05:53.386
Because every time I throw you a
pass, you bat it down,

01:05:53.388 --> 01:05:55.387
- just like you're doing now.
- That's not what we're doing.

01:05:55.389 --> 01:05:58.623
Coming at me with all these...
these legal excuses about the system.

01:05:58.625 --> 01:06:01.494
About how the truth doesn't matter.
The truth matters!

01:06:01.496 --> 01:06:03.132
I know it matters.

01:06:03.998 --> 01:06:05.098
I know that.

01:06:05.100 --> 01:06:07.036
Okay? And that tape is...

01:06:07.368 --> 01:06:08.601
extraordinary.

01:06:08.603 --> 01:06:10.168
I agree. But...

01:06:10.170 --> 01:06:13.007
- I can't do anything legally...
- Okay, okay. Stop.

01:06:13.641 --> 01:06:15.241
Okay? You know what, man?

01:06:15.243 --> 01:06:17.478
You know, forget the tape. Okay?

01:06:20.681 --> 01:06:22.517
You want extraordinary?

01:06:23.784 --> 01:06:27.489
I'll tell you what's
extraordinary about this case.

01:06:28.389 --> 01:06:29.625
I am.

01:06:31.525 --> 01:06:34.529
It's extraordinary
that I'm still here.

01:06:36.230 --> 01:06:37.732
That I'm still standing.

01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:40.703
You ever been in prison?

01:06:41.668 --> 01:06:43.636
I'm not talking about
to visit one of your clients.

01:06:43.638 --> 01:06:45.007
You ever been locked up?

01:06:46.475 --> 01:06:51.411
I spent my 17th birthday and the 60
days after that in solitary confinement.

01:06:51.413 --> 01:06:53.148
It nearly killed me.

01:06:55.150 --> 01:06:58.683
And the only reason it didn't is
because something happened to me.

01:06:58.685 --> 01:07:03.524
Something extraordinary.
Someone extraordinary.

01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:13.702
I've done...

01:07:14.402 --> 01:07:17.139
everything I can on my own...

01:07:18.272 --> 01:07:19.838
to get myself free.

01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:22.608
There's only one other person who
can get me the rest of the way,

01:07:22.610 --> 01:07:24.210
and that's you.

01:07:24.212 --> 01:07:25.714
So, I'm begging you.

01:07:27.248 --> 01:07:29.248
Forget all the rules.

01:07:29.250 --> 01:07:34.087
Forget all the reasons. Forget all
the roadblocks they put in our way.

01:07:34.089 --> 01:07:37.259
I know the system doesn't care
about me, Justin. I know.

01:07:38.460 --> 01:07:40.128
But I know you do.

01:07:44.299 --> 01:07:45.667
Help set me free.

01:07:55.210 --> 01:07:56.244
Okay.

01:08:01.215 --> 01:08:02.217
Okay.

01:08:06.788 --> 01:08:08.090
Right.

01:08:13.895 --> 01:08:14.726
Okay.

01:08:14.728 --> 01:08:17.194
Brian Banks lost
ten years of his life.

01:08:17.197 --> 01:08:19.232
We have ten months
to clear his name. Why?

01:08:19.234 --> 01:08:21.634
Because the habeas petition
will only be considered

01:08:21.636 --> 01:08:23.502
while you're still
under state supervision.

01:08:23.504 --> 01:08:26.506
That's right. If we can't get this
thing overturned within ten months

01:08:26.508 --> 01:08:28.407
before his parole runs out,

01:08:28.408 --> 01:08:29.908
he's guilty
the rest of his life.

01:08:29.910 --> 01:08:32.810
<i>99% of all habeas petitions
get rejected,</i>

01:08:32.813 --> 01:08:35.613
<i>so just getting the DA to pay
attention to this is gonna be tough.</i>

01:08:35.616 --> 01:08:36.716
Hey, Barbara.

01:08:36.718 --> 01:08:38.582
<i>Justin Brooks again.</i>

01:08:38.585 --> 01:08:40.286
<i>Hey, is Rafael in?</i>

01:08:40.287 --> 01:08:42.154
He'll have to get back
to you, Mr. Brooks.

01:08:42.156 --> 01:08:44.390
All right.
As soon as he can, please.

01:08:44.392 --> 01:08:46.225
Thank you.

01:08:46.227 --> 01:08:48.225
<i>So while I'm trying to force him
to pay attention,</i>

01:08:48.228 --> 01:08:50.729
<i>Alissa will put together
a new petition,</i>

01:08:50.731 --> 01:08:53.533
<i>while, Marilyn, you try to
track down Kennisha Rice</i>

01:08:53.535 --> 01:08:55.268
<i>and get her on the record
this time.</i>

01:08:55.270 --> 01:08:57.269
<i>Now, just remember,
and this is critical,</i>

01:08:57.270 --> 01:09:00.404
<i>if the court doesn't schedule us
ASAP, Brian's gonna run out of time.</i>

01:09:00.407 --> 01:09:02.274
<i>Brian's the same age
as some of you.</i>

01:09:02.276 --> 01:09:04.577
<i>He should have gone
to college by now.</i>

01:09:04.578 --> 01:09:05.877
<i>He should be playing in the NFL.</i>

01:09:05.879 --> 01:09:07.578
Hey, we found Mateo.

01:09:07.581 --> 01:09:09.649
He's on the Loller case,
LA Superior.

01:09:09.651 --> 01:09:13.221
<i>And the reason he isn't
is not just because a girl lied,</i>

01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:18.225
<i>it's because the system didn't care
about the truth in the first place.</i>

01:09:19.826 --> 01:09:22.363
Well, in the words of somebody
I greatly admire,

01:09:22.930 --> 01:09:25.167
"Fuck the system."

01:09:27.935 --> 01:09:30.304
- It was a good day.
- Yeah.

01:09:32.439 --> 01:09:36.442
Well, if it isn't
our elusive district attorney.

01:09:36.444 --> 01:09:38.911
- Mr. Brooks.
- How you doing, Rafael? I've been looking for you.

01:09:38.912 --> 01:09:40.845
Aren't we seeing each other
for Leftowich in three weeks?

01:09:40.846 --> 01:09:43.881
This can't wait three weeks.
I'm representing Brian Banks.

01:09:43.884 --> 01:09:45.518
Falsely accused of rape.

01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:47.953
The girl's recanted her story.
We got it all on tape.

01:09:47.955 --> 01:09:49.720
Let me guess. You want me
to take a look at it.

01:09:49.723 --> 01:09:53.326
I want you to meet Brian Banks.
He's an amazing kid.

01:09:53.328 --> 01:09:56.729
Could have played pro ball. I'm telling
you, Rafael, this is gonna blow up.

01:09:56.731 --> 01:09:58.296
Media's gonna be all over it.

01:09:58.298 --> 01:10:00.399
Chance for you to jump in
and control the spin.

01:10:00.401 --> 01:10:03.205
You are the master spinner,
aren't you, Mr. Brooks?

01:10:03.670 --> 01:10:05.240
Well, I'm a lawyer, so...

01:10:05.740 --> 01:10:07.776
it's redundant.

01:10:09.310 --> 01:10:10.344
Come on, Rafael.

01:10:10.712 --> 01:10:11.946
Kid's different.

01:10:14.615 --> 01:10:16.015
Have your client here
in 90 minutes.

01:10:16.017 --> 01:10:18.620
Otherwise, he waits in line
like everyone else.

01:10:24.424 --> 01:10:25.491
Hey, Justin.

01:10:25.493 --> 01:10:27.228
You got a jacket and a tie?

01:10:28.730 --> 01:10:30.363
I look okay?

01:10:30.365 --> 01:10:32.765
Ain't nothing okay
about the way you look.

01:10:32.767 --> 01:10:34.636
Now, go.

01:10:37.771 --> 01:10:40.942
Please do not tell me
this is another bad decision.

01:10:41.875 --> 01:10:43.876
I'm gonna start calling you
Bad Decision Banks.

01:10:43.878 --> 01:10:46.645
- But... I-I have a job interview, sir.
- Oh, yeah?

01:10:46.647 --> 01:10:49.584
Like the one in San Diego when
you were meeting with that lawyer?

01:10:50.485 --> 01:10:53.519
I got my sources.
Give me the keys, Banks.

01:10:53.521 --> 01:10:57.259
- Sir, I-I really have...
- Give me the goddamn keys, Banks.

01:11:03.830 --> 01:11:05.366
Yeah, I got him.

01:11:06.500 --> 01:11:07.766
Where's your guy?

01:11:07.768 --> 01:11:10.271
Hey! Hey, he's coming.
He's just...

01:11:11.306 --> 01:11:12.907
Let me get you
a cup of coffee.

01:11:13.941 --> 01:11:15.944
Nice try, Mr. Brooks.
Time's up.

01:11:16.944 --> 01:11:19.914
Nobody from the DA's office
ever visited the crime scene.

01:11:21.081 --> 01:11:25.751
I did. I saw where this girl claimed
she was dragged down a hallway

01:11:25.753 --> 01:11:28.586
lined with open classrooms
full of students,

01:11:28.588 --> 01:11:29.755
and forcibly raped.

01:11:29.757 --> 01:11:31.927
Nobody saw it.
Nobody heard it.

01:11:33.428 --> 01:11:34.463
Hey,

01:11:35.096 --> 01:11:36.761
you think the brass
is gonna wonder

01:11:36.763 --> 01:11:39.400
why you and your investigators
never checked this place out?

01:11:41.768 --> 01:11:44.436
Sir, this is my mom's car.
My mom.

01:11:44.438 --> 01:11:46.471
There aren't any drugs
in there, I swear.

01:11:46.473 --> 01:11:48.707
Good. So, you have nothing
to worry about.

01:11:48.709 --> 01:11:50.576
Now, why you going to LA?

01:11:50.578 --> 01:11:52.580
You know you can't take a job
outside the district.

01:11:53.681 --> 01:11:56.384
The job's local.
Corporate headquarters are in LA.

01:11:58.419 --> 01:11:59.521
Car's clean.

01:12:01.789 --> 01:12:03.492
You better not be
lying to me, Banks.

01:12:04.792 --> 01:12:07.025
Straight there, straight back.

01:12:07.027 --> 01:12:09.729
'Cause if you so much as
pull over to piss,

01:12:09.731 --> 01:12:11.532
you'll be back behind bars.

01:12:16.603 --> 01:12:18.002
<i>Where are you?</i>

01:12:18.004 --> 01:12:20.605
Yeah, no... I'm on my way.
My PO was busting my ass.

01:12:20.607 --> 01:12:22.410
I'm... I'll be there.

01:12:34.554 --> 01:12:35.624
Hey!

01:12:35.923 --> 01:12:37.422
Sorry, man.

01:12:37.424 --> 01:12:40.458
Save it for the DA.
Mateo's in a mood.

01:12:40.460 --> 01:12:41.562
All right.

01:12:47.502 --> 01:12:50.038
Mr. Brooks says you filed
the habeas petition yourself.

01:12:50.538 --> 01:12:51.936
Yes, sir.

01:12:51.938 --> 01:12:54.476
Read the California Appeals Code
while I was in prison.

01:12:56.511 --> 01:12:59.010
Why do you think she lied,
Mr. Banks?

01:12:59.012 --> 01:13:03.117
She was a 15-year-old girl with her whole
life ahead of her. Why would she lie?

01:13:03.950 --> 01:13:06.053
I've asked myself that
a thousand times.

01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:08.824
Maybe it was the money.

01:13:09.656 --> 01:13:11.360
Maybe I hurt her feelings.

01:13:11.859 --> 01:13:13.626
But with all due respect, sir,

01:13:13.628 --> 01:13:17.598
I don't know why it's my
responsibility to explain why she lied.

01:13:17.999 --> 01:13:20.099
The fact is, she did.

01:13:20.101 --> 01:13:23.571
Her testimony changed
every time. Mine never did.

01:13:24.571 --> 01:13:28.476
Mr. Mateo, I don't wish
any ill will towards Kennisha.

01:13:29.209 --> 01:13:31.609
I just want a chance
to turn all this negativity

01:13:31.611 --> 01:13:33.547
into something positive.

01:13:37.651 --> 01:13:39.585
- Has she gone on the record?
- No.

01:13:39.587 --> 01:13:41.953
We're kind of having a hard time
tracking her down.

01:13:41.955 --> 01:13:43.424
I need to speak with her.

01:13:44.558 --> 01:13:46.458
I won't recommend
reversing any conviction

01:13:46.460 --> 01:13:48.496
until I interview
the victim myself.

01:13:52.098 --> 01:13:53.466
Tell me we're getting close.

01:13:53.468 --> 01:13:55.234
Absolutely.
You did great in there.

01:13:55.236 --> 01:13:57.202
You just got to get her
to show up.

01:13:57.204 --> 01:13:59.704
- What does that mean?
- It's not gonna be easy.

01:13:59.706 --> 01:14:01.040
If the state finds out
she lied,

01:14:01.042 --> 01:14:02.475
she could lose
the whole settlement.

01:14:02.477 --> 01:14:04.577
- The 1.5.
- But Kennisha doesn't know that.

01:14:04.579 --> 01:14:06.545
There ain't no way
she told her mom she flipped.

01:14:06.547 --> 01:14:09.814
I know, but I've seen
this sort of thing before.

01:14:09.816 --> 01:14:11.116
Witnesses,

01:14:11.118 --> 01:14:13.187
- they stay hidden unless...
- Unless?

01:14:13.954 --> 01:14:16.721
No. No, no, no,
Brian, you can't.

01:14:16.723 --> 01:14:18.025
I can't... I can't what?

01:14:19.526 --> 01:14:23.464
I've gone to reporters before to help
me find a witness or get them to talk.

01:14:23.964 --> 01:14:25.534
Sometimes, when you go public,

01:14:26.167 --> 01:14:27.666
people want to
defend themselves.

01:14:27.668 --> 01:14:30.135
- Then that's what we do.
- Listen to me, Brian.

01:14:30.137 --> 01:14:34.676
Your PO finds out that you contacted
Kennisha, you could go right back to jail.

01:14:36.677 --> 01:14:37.746
I told you.

01:14:38.145 --> 01:14:39.681
I'm already in jail.

01:14:47.888 --> 01:14:49.087
<i>This is Mike.</i>

01:14:49.089 --> 01:14:51.924
Hey, Mr. Paley,
uh, this is Brian Banks.

01:14:51.926 --> 01:14:53.826
<i>26-year-old Brian Banks,</i>

01:14:53.828 --> 01:14:56.028
<i>who once had dreams of the NFL,</i>

01:14:56.030 --> 01:14:58.264
<i>is now fighting
to clear his name.</i>

01:14:58.266 --> 01:15:01.199
<i>His football dreams ended
at the age of 16</i>

01:15:01.201 --> 01:15:05.139
<i>when he was accused of a crime
he claims he didn't commit.</i>

01:15:05.772 --> 01:15:06.872
<i>To be clear,</i>

01:15:06.874 --> 01:15:08.640
<i>Brian never raped you?</i>

01:15:08.642 --> 01:15:10.544
<i>No, he did not rape me.</i>

01:15:13.013 --> 01:15:14.779
Brian! Brian!

01:15:14.781 --> 01:15:18.082
Brian! Brian! Is the district
attorney reopening the case?

01:15:18.084 --> 01:15:19.618
Brian,
any more word from Kennisha?

01:15:19.620 --> 01:15:21.153
Do you think you'll get
another shot at the NFL?

01:15:21.155 --> 01:15:23.788
Hey, first I gotta
get my day in court.

01:15:23.790 --> 01:15:24.892
All right?

01:15:27.628 --> 01:15:29.193
- Yeah.
- <i>It worked, Brian.</i>

01:15:29.195 --> 01:15:30.628
The mother surfaced.

01:15:30.630 --> 01:15:31.963
She called
the district attorney's office.

01:15:31.965 --> 01:15:33.832
- Had a whole shit-fit.
- <i>Okay.</i>

01:15:33.834 --> 01:15:37.670
So, Mateo issued a subpoena.
He threatened to call the school district,

01:15:37.672 --> 01:15:40.706
turn over all the evidence
unless they show.

01:15:40.708 --> 01:15:42.675
So, now we're close, Brian.

01:15:42.677 --> 01:15:43.809
We're really close.

01:15:43.811 --> 01:15:46.181
Okay, thanks, Justin. Yeah.

01:15:57.991 --> 01:15:59.358
Contacting the victim.

01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:01.693
Recording her
without her consent.

01:16:01.695 --> 01:16:03.628
Lying to your PO
about job interviews.

01:16:03.630 --> 01:16:05.096
That's three strikes,
right there.

01:16:05.098 --> 01:16:07.232
Now, look, I know you saw it.

01:16:07.234 --> 01:16:09.234
And you heard her say
I didn't do it

01:16:09.236 --> 01:16:11.069
because I didn't do it.

01:16:11.071 --> 01:16:13.706
Now, if someone put that on you,
you would have done the same thing.

01:16:13.708 --> 01:16:16.140
No, wrong. Don't tell me
what I'd do, Banks.

01:16:16.142 --> 01:16:17.909
You and I ain't the same.

01:16:17.911 --> 01:16:20.211
Do you even know what the
word "credibility" means?

01:16:20.213 --> 01:16:22.747
You have no credibility
when you lie to me

01:16:22.749 --> 01:16:24.685
to prove that someone
lied about you.

01:16:25.218 --> 01:16:26.851
That is in direct violation

01:16:26.853 --> 01:16:28.720
of your parole under the law.

01:16:28.722 --> 01:16:29.990
Do you hear me?

01:16:31.225 --> 01:16:32.593
Do you hear me?

01:16:34.728 --> 01:16:36.063
Yes, sir, I hear you.

01:16:39.032 --> 01:16:42.603
It is my duty
to report your violations.

01:16:43.236 --> 01:16:45.072
And I plan to obey that duty.

01:16:46.874 --> 01:16:48.043
In time.

01:16:50.811 --> 01:16:53.615
Law says I have to report it.
It just doesn't say when.

01:16:54.981 --> 01:16:57.985
I'm gonna give you eight weeks,
till your parole is up.

01:16:59.020 --> 01:17:01.822
If, in that time,
they do not overturn your conviction,

01:17:02.757 --> 01:17:05.226
you won't just be
a registered sex offender.

01:17:06.293 --> 01:17:08.029
You'll be a prisoner again.

01:17:30.250 --> 01:17:32.887
Mr. Brooks,
where is this witness?

01:17:33.920 --> 01:17:36.421
Your Honor, uh,
we respectfully ask the court

01:17:36.423 --> 01:17:38.724
to just indulge us
with a little more time.

01:17:38.726 --> 01:17:40.225
She's half an hour late.

01:17:40.227 --> 01:17:41.859
You think this is
the only hearing on the docket?

01:17:41.861 --> 01:17:44.395
Issue another subpoena
and reschedule the hearing.

01:17:44.397 --> 01:17:46.200
Adjourned.

01:17:50.804 --> 01:17:53.305
Come on, Rafael.
Can't you work with me a little bit?

01:17:53.307 --> 01:17:55.340
I mean, there's no time
for another hearing.

01:17:55.342 --> 01:17:57.710
Brian's parole
is gonna run out.

01:17:57.712 --> 01:18:00.011
Then it's over. He's done.
You know that.

01:18:00.013 --> 01:18:02.881
I need a statement from the
complainant on the record.

01:18:02.883 --> 01:18:06.254
A statement that casts doubt on her
original testimony. Now, you know that.

01:18:09.956 --> 01:18:11.457
Justin, that's her mom.

01:18:11.459 --> 01:18:13.094
That's her.

01:18:15.762 --> 01:18:16.828
Ms. Rice.

01:18:16.830 --> 01:18:18.199
Ms. Rice.

01:18:20.133 --> 01:18:21.966
Now, who the hell are y'all?

01:18:21.968 --> 01:18:25.037
I'm District Attorney Rafael Mateo, ma'am.
You're in the right place.

01:18:25.039 --> 01:18:27.005
- Are you Kennisha?
- Yeah, that's her.

01:18:27.007 --> 01:18:30.408
Look, the only reason why we came down
here is to clear up all this bullshit.

01:18:30.410 --> 01:18:32.510
We want to clear this up too,
ma'am.

01:18:32.512 --> 01:18:35.148
So, maybe we can all sit down
and have a talk.

01:18:39.386 --> 01:18:41.052
So, Kennisha,
this won't take long.

01:18:41.054 --> 01:18:42.954
- We have some questions.
- This all you need to know.

01:18:42.956 --> 01:18:46.125
That boy out there,
he raped my daughter.

01:18:46.127 --> 01:18:47.458
End of story.

01:18:47.460 --> 01:18:49.528
All that other shit on TV
he forced her to say.

01:18:49.530 --> 01:18:52.264
He offered her $10,000.

01:18:52.266 --> 01:18:55.434
Kennisha, you told our investigator
that Brian offered you $20,000.

01:18:55.436 --> 01:18:57.368
Mama, can you take him
out of here, please?

01:18:57.370 --> 01:18:59.773
Just say what you said
the first time in court.

01:19:00.039 --> 01:19:01.074
Come on.

01:19:19.893 --> 01:19:22.027
I'm not gonna answer none
of y'all's stupid questions.

01:19:22.029 --> 01:19:25.165
- Ms. Rice, I just need...
- I said I'm not answering them!

01:19:27.267 --> 01:19:30.502
What if I make my best effort
to not ask any stupid questions?

01:19:30.504 --> 01:19:33.005
They're all stupid,
if you ask me.

01:19:33.007 --> 01:19:36.475
Well, my name is Justin Brooks and I
run the California Innocence Project.

01:19:36.477 --> 01:19:39.577
We get thousands of requests
every year

01:19:39.579 --> 01:19:41.246
for people to represent them.

01:19:41.248 --> 01:19:43.817
And Kennisha,
if Brian Banks raped you,

01:19:44.384 --> 01:19:46.051
I don't want
to represent him.

01:19:46.053 --> 01:19:47.952
- He did rape me.
- Okay. Okay.

01:19:47.954 --> 01:19:50.021
Well, if you can just
get me to accept that

01:19:50.023 --> 01:19:53.926
and clear up a few of these
inconsistencies, we can all move on here.

01:19:53.928 --> 01:19:54.693
Okay?

01:19:54.695 --> 01:19:56.327
I just want
to talk to you briefly

01:19:56.329 --> 01:19:59.800
about the incident
in July of 2002.

01:20:00.768 --> 01:20:02.935
When you went into
that stairwell with Brian,

01:20:02.937 --> 01:20:04.939
what did you think
was gonna happen?

01:20:05.873 --> 01:20:08.873
I don't know.
I was young at the time.

01:20:08.875 --> 01:20:09.944
Right.

01:20:10.410 --> 01:20:12.077
At the top of the stairwell,

01:20:12.079 --> 01:20:13.412
there are classrooms.

01:20:13.414 --> 01:20:15.546
- School was in session.
- Mm-hmm.

01:20:15.548 --> 01:20:19.217
So, why didn't you just
shout out to anybody?

01:20:19.219 --> 01:20:21.356
'Cause I didn't know
he was gonna do it.

01:20:22.088 --> 01:20:23.588
When we first went down there,

01:20:23.590 --> 01:20:26.995
I thought he was just gonna touch.
You know, touchy-feely.

01:20:30.030 --> 01:20:31.529
So, Ms. Rice,

01:20:31.531 --> 01:20:33.967
are you saying that you initially
went down there willingly?

01:20:35.236 --> 01:20:36.404
No.

01:20:37.103 --> 01:20:38.403
You putting words in my mouth.

01:20:38.405 --> 01:20:39.938
You just said,
"When we first went down there,

01:20:39.940 --> 01:20:41.372
I thought it was gonna be
touchy-feely."

01:20:41.374 --> 01:20:42.975
You didn't say that
he forced or dragged you.

01:20:42.977 --> 01:20:45.547
There you go again
with them stupid questions.

01:20:46.146 --> 01:20:47.912
Brian know he did it.

01:20:47.914 --> 01:20:50.482
If he was so innocent,
he would have took it to trial and won.

01:20:50.484 --> 01:20:55.119
Kennisha, don't you think
anybody's ever been coerced

01:20:55.121 --> 01:20:56.990
into taking a plea before?

01:20:57.624 --> 01:21:00.127
I mean, maybe Brian
just felt trapped.

01:21:00.895 --> 01:21:03.327
But listen,
we all make mistakes,

01:21:03.329 --> 01:21:05.132
especially when we're young.
We...

01:21:05.566 --> 01:21:07.836
We say things we regret.

01:21:09.904 --> 01:21:11.203
Isn't it possible

01:21:11.205 --> 01:21:14.508
that maybe you said some things
back then that you didn't mean?

01:21:16.310 --> 01:21:19.580
Kennisha, did Brian ever coerce
you or pay you to talk to him?

01:21:21.315 --> 01:21:22.984
He ain't got no money.

01:21:24.084 --> 01:21:25.516
Right.

01:21:25.518 --> 01:21:28.420
So you reached out to him
on your Facebook page yourself

01:21:28.422 --> 01:21:29.857
to help him, right?

01:21:31.057 --> 01:21:32.491
That was nice.

01:21:32.493 --> 01:21:34.359
Because you know you didn't

01:21:34.361 --> 01:21:36.331
have sex with him
in that stairwell.

01:21:38.699 --> 01:21:39.797
You know that.

01:21:39.799 --> 01:21:42.337
You guys went down there
to make out. And then Brian...

01:21:43.536 --> 01:21:46.540
you know, he may have embarrassed
you a little bit that day, right?

01:21:47.708 --> 01:21:50.044
Maybe because he didn't want
to go through with it.

01:21:52.445 --> 01:21:54.448
I understand,
and you liked him.

01:21:57.051 --> 01:21:58.319
You liked him a lot.

01:22:00.154 --> 01:22:01.188
It's okay.

01:22:02.522 --> 01:22:04.622
Yeah, y'all started it,
but we gonna finish it.

01:22:04.624 --> 01:22:06.425
You...

01:22:06.427 --> 01:22:09.293
Kennisha, what you said on the
tape the other day, if it's true,

01:22:09.295 --> 01:22:10.729
Brian can get his life back.

01:22:10.731 --> 01:22:13.332
You can help him get a job.

01:22:13.334 --> 01:22:15.734
- He can move on with his life.
- What the hell is taking so long in here?

01:22:15.736 --> 01:22:18.537
Oh, did you tell them the truth this time?

01:22:18.539 --> 01:22:21.075
Or they got you in here
making up some other story?

01:22:22.609 --> 01:22:24.542
What about my life?

01:22:24.544 --> 01:22:27.144
I go on with my life?
Can I get my virginity back?

01:22:27.146 --> 01:22:28.512
Ms. Rice, I just need...

01:22:28.514 --> 01:22:31.082
I ain't talking to you no more.
You a smartass.

01:22:31.084 --> 01:22:32.751
Just... Let's take a break,
and we'll just

01:22:32.753 --> 01:22:35.052
- come back here in a moment.
- I'm not coming back!

01:22:35.054 --> 01:22:36.287
I'm never coming back.

01:22:36.289 --> 01:22:38.724
I'm done talking to y'all. I'm done.
I'm not talking no more!

01:22:38.726 --> 01:22:41.092
- Ms. Rice, we have to...
- No. You heard her.

01:22:41.094 --> 01:22:43.030
Talking's over. Let's go.

01:22:46.366 --> 01:22:47.765
She admitted
it was consensual.

01:22:47.767 --> 01:22:49.333
She said
it started consensually...

01:22:49.335 --> 01:22:51.435
Which eliminates
the kidnapping charge.

01:22:51.437 --> 01:22:53.372
You said you needed
something on the record

01:22:53.374 --> 01:22:56.475
that would cast doubt on her original
testimony. Didn't you just get that?

01:22:56.477 --> 01:22:58.109
All I can do is recommend

01:22:58.111 --> 01:22:59.711
that the same judge who put
Brian away overturn this.

01:22:59.713 --> 01:23:01.278
And you know
the chances of that.

01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:03.517
Don't let that stop you.

01:23:06.053 --> 01:23:08.456
Do you have a child,
Mr. Mateo?

01:23:10.790 --> 01:23:12.556
Can you imagine

01:23:12.558 --> 01:23:14.529
what it's like
seeing that child,

01:23:15.228 --> 01:23:17.030
that innocent child,

01:23:17.530 --> 01:23:19.032
taken from you

01:23:19.465 --> 01:23:21.002
and locked away with

01:23:21.668 --> 01:23:24.005
men who have done real crimes

01:23:24.605 --> 01:23:26.607
and can do real harm to him?

01:23:28.542 --> 01:23:31.810
All a mother ever wants

01:23:31.812 --> 01:23:34.148
is to protect her children.

01:23:35.615 --> 01:23:38.585
And I was never ever able
to do that for my boy.

01:23:40.687 --> 01:23:42.190
I'll go to my grave

01:23:42.688 --> 01:23:45.159
feeling the pain of that past.

01:23:46.727 --> 01:23:49.630
But you can do something today,
Mr. Mateo,

01:23:50.463 --> 01:23:52.766
to stop the pain of his future.

01:23:54.067 --> 01:23:55.168
Now, that judge,

01:23:56.536 --> 01:23:58.172
he will listen to you.

01:23:59.306 --> 01:24:00.674
You know he will,

01:24:01.508 --> 01:24:03.211
if you believe in your heart

01:24:04.178 --> 01:24:07.682
that what was done to my son
was wrong.

01:24:26.232 --> 01:24:27.467
<i>All rise.</i>

01:24:32.205 --> 01:24:33.206
Be seated.

01:24:34.607 --> 01:24:36.741
Okay, <i>People vs. Banks.</i>

01:24:36.743 --> 01:24:39.877
I have before me a petition
for writ of habeas corpus,

01:24:39.879 --> 01:24:44.518
petition of error coram nobis to
overturn the original judgment.

01:24:44.750 --> 01:24:45.850
So...

01:24:45.852 --> 01:24:48.155
do the petitioners
wish to say anything?

01:24:48.621 --> 01:24:50.223
Yes, thank you, Your Honor.

01:24:54.895 --> 01:24:56.097
Brian Banks

01:24:56.496 --> 01:24:58.630
was 16 years old

01:24:58.632 --> 01:25:01.201
when he was accused of a crime
he did not commit.

01:25:02.503 --> 01:25:05.336
He lost 11 years
of his young life.

01:25:05.338 --> 01:25:06.872
A scholarship.

01:25:06.874 --> 01:25:09.674
He was prevented from playing
football, a game that he loves.

01:25:09.676 --> 01:25:11.312
And I think we have to ask why.

01:25:12.646 --> 01:25:14.378
Was it the system
that failed him?

01:25:14.380 --> 01:25:18.285
Nobody has been more critical
of this system than I have.

01:25:19.620 --> 01:25:21.252
But I've come to realize,

01:25:21.254 --> 01:25:25.125
maybe it's not the system.
Maybe it's us.

01:25:26.493 --> 01:25:27.661
All of us.

01:25:29.295 --> 01:25:30.330
Maybe it's me.

01:25:31.231 --> 01:25:33.198
Yes, we have laws.

01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:35.670
But those laws
can be interpreted.

01:25:36.469 --> 01:25:38.502
There is
just enough flexibility

01:25:38.504 --> 01:25:40.905
to allow for
some amount of choice.

01:25:40.907 --> 01:25:43.675
And with that choice
comes the power to do right.

01:25:43.677 --> 01:25:46.545
To choose justice
over expediency,

01:25:46.547 --> 01:25:49.280
and the truth
over a technicality.

01:25:49.282 --> 01:25:51.352
And the truth is,
Brian Banks is innocent.

01:25:53.486 --> 01:25:54.952
Eleven years, Your Honor.

01:25:54.954 --> 01:25:58.355
Eleven years my client
will never get back.

01:25:58.357 --> 01:26:01.128
Eleven years his family

01:26:02.195 --> 01:26:03.296
has had to suffer.

01:26:04.397 --> 01:26:06.234
Eleven years of dreams deferred.

01:26:09.268 --> 01:26:10.268
And we can fix it.

01:26:10.270 --> 01:26:12.240
We can rectify it all
here today.

01:26:13.574 --> 01:26:14.905
You know, most of the time,

01:26:14.907 --> 01:26:16.774
I'm just trying to get my client
their lives back.

01:26:16.776 --> 01:26:18.842
In Brian Banks' case,

01:26:18.844 --> 01:26:21.249
we have a chance
to give him his dreams back.

01:26:24.651 --> 01:26:26.687
Please don't deny him
that chance.

01:26:28.222 --> 01:26:29.257
Thank you.

01:26:33.727 --> 01:26:34.929
And the People?

01:26:48.407 --> 01:26:50.408
The People will concede the
matter, Your Honor,

01:26:50.410 --> 01:26:54.215
and ask the court to grant
the petition for exoneration.

01:27:40.459 --> 01:27:41.661
All right, then.

01:27:42.795 --> 01:27:44.764
The petition is granted.

01:27:59.379 --> 01:28:00.414
Brian.

01:28:11.023 --> 01:28:12.259
Thank you.

01:28:12.793 --> 01:28:13.960
Thank you.

01:28:15.094 --> 01:28:16.429
Thank you

01:28:16.862 --> 01:28:18.298
for not giving up,

01:28:19.066 --> 01:28:20.968
for making sure
I didn't either.

01:28:25.705 --> 01:28:27.507
- Well done, Brooks.
- Thank you.

01:28:32.079 --> 01:28:34.315
Brian!

01:28:41.887 --> 01:28:43.854
- Brian!
- Brian!

01:28:43.856 --> 01:28:45.457
Brian,
tell us how you're feeling.

01:28:45.459 --> 01:28:48.329
- Do you plan to sue?
- Are you angry at the situation?

01:28:48.728 --> 01:28:49.728
No. At some point,

01:28:49.730 --> 01:28:51.464
you gotta let all that go.

01:28:52.031 --> 01:28:53.900
All I ever wanted
was my freedom,

01:28:54.601 --> 01:28:55.803
and we got that here today.

01:29:42.648 --> 01:29:43.883
Two!

01:29:44.517 --> 01:29:46.553
Hut! Hut!

01:29:47.587 --> 01:29:48.789
Hut!

01:29:49.088 --> 01:29:50.390
Hut!

01:30:03.069 --> 01:30:04.068
Hello?

01:30:04.070 --> 01:30:05.869
Hey, I'm looking
for a linebacker.

01:30:05.871 --> 01:30:07.407
Know where I might find any?

01:30:09.709 --> 01:30:11.045
Coach Carroll.

01:30:13.079 --> 01:30:15.046
<i>It was good to see you
on TV the other day.</i>

01:30:15.048 --> 01:30:16.648
How are you, old friend?

01:30:16.650 --> 01:30:19.082
Oh, I'm on top of the world,
Coach. How you doing?

01:30:19.084 --> 01:30:21.085
I'm doing pretty well
up here in Seattle.

01:30:21.087 --> 01:30:25.223
<i>I'm so sorry you had to go to hell and
back, Brian, but wanted to ask you.</i>

01:30:25.225 --> 01:30:28.495
Think you may want to come up
here and try out for the Seahawks?

01:30:31.565 --> 01:30:33.898
Oh, most definitely, Coach.
Most definitely.

01:30:33.900 --> 01:30:36.701
<i>All right. I need you on the
plane first thing Monday morning.</i>

01:30:36.703 --> 01:30:38.839
Yeah. Thanks.

01:30:54.855 --> 01:30:55.953
Y'all trying to play?

01:30:55.955 --> 01:30:57.154
Yeah.

01:30:57.156 --> 01:30:59.122
