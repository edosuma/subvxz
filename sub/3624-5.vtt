a break-in, I'd...

10:33.133 --> 10:34.232
know about it?

10:34.234 --> 10:36.234
Exactly.

10:36.236 --> 10:37.769
Oh!

10:44.477 --> 10:47.612
Shego! Shouldn't you
be behind bars?

10:47.614 --> 10:49.414
I got an early parole.

10:49.416 --> 10:51.583
Only here to say hi.

10:55.221 --> 10:56.554
Hey! Yahh.

10:56.556 --> 10:58.423
Hey, red.
How's it shaking?

10:58.425 --> 11:02.627
I can't believe you actually
teamed up with this loser.

11:02.629 --> 11:03.862
Look, I am not
thrilled about it,

11:03.864 --> 11:06.631
but sometimes you gotta
do what you gotta do.

11:06.633 --> 11:10.335
I got the goods.
Let's roll.

11:10.603 --> 11:12.537
Put that rocket down!

11:12.539 --> 11:13.938
Sorry. Time to fly.

11:13.940 --> 11:15.674
You're not going anywhere.

11:15.676 --> 11:17.475
Oh, not me. You.

11:17.477 --> 11:18.677
Seriously.

11:18.679 --> 11:20.378
Whoa!

11:20.380 --> 11:24.482
Do you still have that hair
gel I gave you last week?

11:24.484 --> 11:26.451
It's actually
a special compound

11:26.453 --> 11:29.621
that expands
when exposed to air.

11:42.668 --> 11:44.602
It also adds body.

11:44.604 --> 11:46.604
Grrr.

11:54.747 --> 11:57.282
No mocking the hair.

11:57.284 --> 12:00.985
I know the basic
boyfriend rules, Kim.

12:00.987 --> 12:02.620
Your new haircut is fabulous,

12:02.622 --> 12:04.556
and those slacks
are very flattering.

12:04.558 --> 12:08.660
Sorry, but we're contractually
obligated to mock.

12:08.662 --> 12:11.730
Ok, just get it over with.

12:11.732 --> 12:14.432
It's no fun if you help.

12:14.434 --> 12:17.502
[Chainsaw whirs]

12:17.737 --> 12:19.771
What are you doing?

12:19.773 --> 12:22.273
Cutting down on wind resistance.
Seriously.

12:22.275 --> 12:24.576
Except the wings
are what makes it fly.

12:24.578 --> 12:27.579
It's all part of my
way-wicked awesome plan.

12:27.581 --> 12:28.580
Yeah, about that. Um...

12:28.582 --> 12:29.748
can't talk. Working.

12:29.750 --> 12:31.382
Here's the blueprints.

12:31.384 --> 12:34.552
See if you can find a place
for a new cupholder.

12:34.554 --> 12:37.422
Uhh! Huh?

12:42.394 --> 12:44.729
[Sighs] Ok, here's the deal.

12:44.731 --> 12:48.466
But that doesn't mean
I have to be seen with you.

12:48.468 --> 12:49.667
So duck or walk.

12:49.669 --> 12:52.036
Now!
[Both groan]

12:54.006 --> 12:56.474
Ron, not you.

13:00.746 --> 13:02.580
[Gasps]

13:03.082 --> 13:07.418
Ok, it's Bonnie, so stay down.
Showtime.

13:07.987 --> 13:09.420
What's hot, B?

13:09.422 --> 13:10.855
Oh, you have a car, K?

13:10.857 --> 13:12.557
Begged, borrowed, or stolen?

13:12.559 --> 13:14.893
You wish.
This is all mine.

13:14.895 --> 13:17.562
Oh, taking it in
for the recall?

13:17.564 --> 13:21.766
And it can blow the doors off
any car, anywhere, anytime.

13:21.768 --> 13:24.836
And Kim has to drive us
where we want.

13:24.838 --> 13:27.338
So it's a babysitter car.

13:27.340 --> 13:29.541
Ha ha ha ha ha!

13:29.775 --> 13:32.377
The only ride
you're going to need

13:32.379 --> 13:34.012
will be to the hospital!

13:34.014 --> 13:34.913
Kim!

13:34.915 --> 13:36.915
Whew. Saved by the Wade.

13:36.917 --> 13:38.750
I got the specs on the
kepler from your dad.

13:38.752 --> 13:41.619
If it reaches its top speed
within the earth's atmosphere,

13:41.621 --> 13:44.589
the shockwave will flatten
everything in its path.

13:44.591 --> 13:45.757
Nice!
Nice!

13:45.759 --> 13:50.094
I mean, who'd be dumb enough
to try that?

13:50.096 --> 13:54.465
Huh. The kepler specs
are pretty impressive.

13:54.467 --> 13:55.867
Of course, it's all
how you use it.

13:55.869 --> 13:58.069
It's so gonna rock.
Seriously.

13:58.071 --> 14:00.972
I think maybe I can
get onboard with this.

14:00.974 --> 14:03.608
It looks like a racecar.

14:03.610 --> 14:09.581
You know, your chassis could use
a little tricking out, too.

14:09.583 --> 14:12.884
Excuse me. What's wrong
with my chassis?

14:12.886 --> 14:17.989
Oh, no, Shego. I'm talking
about your disguise.

14:17.991 --> 14:18.823
Disguise?

14:18.825 --> 14:20.592
It's part of the plan.

14:20.594 --> 14:24.829
[Sighs] Ok, but no flames.

14:26.899 --> 14:31.469
We've been driving around for an
hour and haven't seen anything.

14:31.471 --> 14:32.604
Nacho stop?

14:32.606 --> 14:34.939
No time. We've
gotta find mullet-head

14:34.941 --> 14:36.941
before he puts
the pedal to the metal.

14:36.943 --> 14:39.544
[Whimpers]

14:41.447 --> 14:43.648
[Gasps] Kim, it's the...

14:43.650 --> 14:44.549
Ron, I said no.

14:44.551 --> 14:47.085
I don't care
how hungry you are.

14:47.087 --> 14:49.587
It's the...

14:49.589 --> 14:52.056
the kepler. Why didn't
you say something?

14:52.058 --> 14:54.726
I forgot what it was called.

15:09.642 --> 15:10.808
Did you see that?

15:10.810 --> 15:12.977
It's as fast as a rocket.

15:12.979 --> 15:14.512
Hicka-bicka-duh!

15:14.514 --> 15:16.481
Oh!
Take us home.

15:16.483 --> 15:17.582
That is it.

15:17.584 --> 15:19.417
I may have signed
that silly contract,

15:19.419 --> 15:21.119
but first
I'm stopping motor ed.

15:21.121 --> 15:22.620
What?
Not in this, you're not.

15:22.622 --> 15:24.589
We have to supercharge
the engines.

15:24.591 --> 15:27.592
Nobody blows our doors off.

15:28.627 --> 15:31.629
This is personal.

15:38.704 --> 15:40.605
And check it.

15:40.607 --> 15:45.476
The roth SL coupe 2.0.

15:45.478 --> 15:47.712
Whoo-hoo!

15:50.749 --> 15:54.619
Ugh. Could you possibly
drive any slower?

15:54.621 --> 15:57.922
The faster the ride, the
slower the glide, babe.

15:57.924 --> 16:01.092
Hey, you're supposed
to be chewing gum.

16:01.094 --> 16:06.664
It pulls together your
whole, you know, disguise.

16:07.132 --> 16:12.737
There. Now can you tell me
the rest of this awesome plan?

16:12.739 --> 16:14.739
No spoilers.

16:14.741 --> 16:19.010
Whoa. What's that?
Seriously.

16:19.611 --> 16:20.945
You sure we can catch them?

16:20.947 --> 16:22.847
With our new modifications...

16:22.849 --> 16:24.782
Just watch.

16:27.820 --> 16:31.656
Great. Kimmy gets a car,
and now she's everywhere.

16:31.658 --> 16:33.624
Like bacteria.

16:33.626 --> 16:37.195
Aah!
Whoo-hoo!

16:41.200 --> 16:43.568
Huh?

16:44.837 --> 16:46.771
Ok, one for the Tweebs.

16:46.773 --> 16:50.041
Guys, remember,
you can't let the kepler

16:50.043 --> 16:51.576
break its threshold speed.

16:51.578 --> 16:52.977
What's the threshold speed?

16:52.979 --> 16:54.812
Oh, you'll know it
when you see it.

16:54.814 --> 16:57.115
See, like, why are
these dice fuzzy?

16:57.117 --> 16:59.283
It makes no sense.

16:59.285 --> 17:04.722
Shotgun babes don't get
to criticize the dude

17:04.724 --> 17:06.290
or his dice. Seriously.

17:06.292 --> 17:08.793
Shotgun babe?

17:17.070 --> 17:20.805
Looking good.
Nice speed.

17:20.807 --> 17:22.673
Sweet paint job.

17:23.676 --> 17:27.045
And pick up some milk
on your way home.

17:27.047 --> 17:28.613
Uh-uh-uh-uh!

17:28.615 --> 17:29.547
Are we slowing down?

17:29.549 --> 17:31.082
No, they're speeding up,

17:31.084 --> 17:32.650
and we're topped out.

17:32.652 --> 17:36.988
Uh-uh. That was
just first gear.

17:42.694 --> 17:47.298
Ok, that's two for the Tweebs.

17:47.300 --> 17:49.600
Don't worry about them.

17:49.602 --> 17:51.936
Get on with the plan.
I am tired of waiting.

17:51.938 --> 17:54.806
Whoa! The dude decides
what to do.

17:54.808 --> 17:56.974
You don't get
to boss me around.

17:56.976 --> 18:00.678
You got lipstick on
your teeth right there.

18:00.680 --> 18:03.648
Oh, I hate that.
Thanks.

18:06.318 --> 18:09.687
Aah! Aah! Aah!

18:11.924 --> 18:16.961
Finally! A chance to test my
theories on zero-g nacho eating.

18:21.333 --> 18:25.636
It's still good.
To the future!

18:29.775 --> 18:32.376
Ok, even if I do catch them,

18:32.378 --> 18:33.911
how am I gonna stop the kepler?

18:33.913 --> 18:35.012
If you cut the power
from the feed,

18:35.014 --> 18:36.314
it'll disengage
the quadra drive.

18:36.316 --> 18:39.684
That'll cause...
A cascade one power drop!

18:39.686 --> 18:40.651
Brilliant!
Brilliant!

18:40.653 --> 18:43.087
Appreciate the peer review
positive feedback.

18:43.089 --> 18:46.624
Sorry to interrupt
your little geekfest,

18:46.626 --> 18:50.628
there's a panel on the
outside of the kepler.

18:50.630 --> 18:55.233
So I just have to jump
onto a speeding rocket?

18:55.235 --> 18:56.300
Pretty much.

18:56.302 --> 18:58.369
Ron, take the wheel.

18:58.371 --> 18:59.170
Aah!

19:07.112 --> 19:10.648
I had nothing to do with this.

19:10.650 --> 19:13.718
They'll help you hang on
to the side of the kepler.

19:13.720 --> 19:15.119
Ha ha ha! Right.

19:15.121 --> 19:19.290
That's what I thought,
you know, they were for.

19:29.935 --> 19:31.269
Whoa! Red's hitching a ride.

19:31.271 --> 19:35.072
Time to show her what this baby can do.
Seriously.

19:35.074 --> 19:37.408
I'm gonna hit
the big red button.

19:37.410 --> 19:39.710
This is what
I've been waiting for.

19:39.712 --> 19:41.445

19:41.447 --> 19:44.081
Ha ha ha. You know it.

The shock wave
will cause massive damage,

19:48.121 --> 19:50.021
dooming the world to chaos.

19:50.023 --> 19:53.391
You are the man with the plan.

19:53.393 --> 19:54.158
What?

19:54.160 --> 19:56.360
The hyper-sonic blast.

19:56.362 --> 19:57.995
Your plan.

19:57.997 --> 19:59.263
That's not it.

19:59.265 --> 20:01.065
It's not? What is?

20:01.067 --> 20:04.435

at hyper-sonic speed

to do before I croak.

20:09.108 --> 20:10.408
Next stop, Alaskan cruise, man.

20:10.410 --> 20:14.278
Wait. You mean I'm here
because I'm an ornament?

20:14.280 --> 20:17.014
Not. The fuzzy dice
are an ornament.

20:17.016 --> 20:19.750
You are an accessory.

20:19.752 --> 20:22.186
Rrrr. Rrrr!

20:22.188 --> 20:26.490
Aah! Seriously!

20:30.496 --> 20:34.332
Good, because the quadra
drive has been engaged

20:34.334 --> 20:37.001
and no one's driving.

20:37.003 --> 20:39.837
Why is this never easy?

grappler beam in this thing.

on parts to come in.

more modifications.
