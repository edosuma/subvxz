01:40.633 --> 01:42.768
Come quickly and hear me, oh Lord,

01:42.770 --> 01:44.803
for my spirit is weakening.

01:44.805 --> 01:47.139
Do not hide your face from me.

01:47.141 --> 01:50.642
Do not let me be like the dead
who go down to the underworld.

01:50.644 --> 01:52.177
Amen.

02:32.785 --> 02:35.587
It is the group that defines us,

02:35.589 --> 02:37.756
that gives us meaning,

02:37.758 --> 02:40.826
belonging, a sense
of a common goal.

02:40.828 --> 02:42.694
We are born alone and die alone.

02:42.696 --> 02:45.364
But in this journey,

02:45.366 --> 02:48.667
we are given the chance
to walk the path together

02:48.669 --> 02:51.737
<i>instead of wandering in
the mist like lost sheep.</i>

02:51.739 --> 02:53.672
Body of Christ.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.240
Amen.

02:55.242 --> 02:57.576
<i>Now, if we are
to become a flock,</i>

02:57.578 --> 02:59.478
<i>if that is our true destiny,</i>

02:59.480 --> 03:01.713
<i>who then is our true shepherd?</i>

03:05.485 --> 03:08.587
<i>I believe it is the one
who will deliver us</i>

03:08.589 --> 03:10.656
<i>to the green meadows</i>

03:10.658 --> 03:13.192
instead of the slaughterhouse.

03:18.231 --> 03:19.698
Through the ministry
of the Church,

03:19.700 --> 03:21.800
may God give you
pardon and peace.

03:21.802 --> 03:23.802
I absolve you from your sins.

03:23.804 --> 03:26.605
In the name of the Father and
of the Son and the Holy Spirit.

03:26.607 --> 03:27.940
Amen.

03:27.942 --> 03:29.441
You are now freed
from your sins.

03:29.443 --> 03:30.509
Go in peace.

03:30.511 --> 03:32.611
Peace be to God.

03:40.887 --> 03:44.423
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

03:44.425 --> 03:47.259
It has been six years
since my last confession.

03:47.261 --> 03:48.760
These are my sins.

03:48.762 --> 03:51.530
I've lost my faith.

03:51.532 --> 03:53.632
I've broken the vow of marriage.

03:53.634 --> 03:56.668
I've worked on Sunday.
I've neglected prayer.

03:56.670 --> 04:01.974
I've shown great disrespect to
my parents and family members.

04:01.976 --> 04:04.676
I've abused...

04:04.678 --> 04:08.614
alcohol and drugs a great deal,

04:08.616 --> 04:10.015
and I've enjoyed it.

04:10.017 --> 04:12.484
I've been impatient, angry,

04:12.486 --> 04:15.687
envious, proud, jealous,

04:15.689 --> 04:18.624
revengeful, and lazy.

04:18.625 --> 04:20.524
I have had sex

04:20.527 --> 04:25.664
outside of marriage
countless times.

04:25.666 --> 04:27.599
I've not accepted
God's will for me.

04:29.369 --> 04:32.804
Instead, I've placed my trust
in substitutes for God

04:32.806 --> 04:36.708
and I have despaired of God's mercy.

04:36.710 --> 04:39.911
Can my soul really be saved?

04:39.913 --> 04:43.515
Could you really absolve me
from all of those sins, Father?

04:45.585 --> 04:49.755
What... brought you here today, child?

04:49.757 --> 04:52.958
I saw God yesterday,

04:52.960 --> 04:55.460
and he challenged me to come here.

04:55.462 --> 04:56.695
You saw God.

04:56.697 --> 05:00.032
He came to me through a needle.

05:00.034 --> 05:02.034
God always likes to come inside of me

05:02.036 --> 05:03.935
through large and pointy objects.

05:05.939 --> 05:09.941
Are you a tool of God, Father?

05:09.943 --> 05:13.478
A as the Father sent me, so I send you.

05:13.480 --> 05:16.515
Y you are freed from your sins.
Go in peace.

05:42.842 --> 05:45.110
Did you hire a new housekeeper yet?

05:46.512 --> 05:48.347
No.

05:48.349 --> 05:50.582
Oh, boy.

05:50.584 --> 05:54.619
So, what is it, eggs for
breakfast, lunch, and dinner?

05:56.356 --> 05:59.091
Something like that.

05:59.093 --> 06:00.892
Sometimes I'll make a salad.

06:02.462 --> 06:05.130
The place is probably
a pigsty by now.

06:06.065 --> 06:07.699
It's okay.

06:09.702 --> 06:12.003
I enjoy the solitude.

06:12.005 --> 06:15.374
Well, if you stopped
drinking so much,

06:15.376 --> 06:16.808
you'd find it less appealing.

06:18.711 --> 06:20.045
Maybe.

06:22.682 --> 06:25.751
I've seen them come and go, Father.

06:25.753 --> 06:28.420
Nobody's perfect.

06:28.422 --> 06:31.790
It's okay to have doubts.

06:32.792 --> 06:34.593
The best ones always do.

06:44.570 --> 06:46.805
My Lord,

06:46.807 --> 06:50.442
please watch over
our friend in need

06:50.444 --> 06:53.078
and hold a special place in
your infinite wisdom and grace

06:53.080 --> 06:56.581
for my friend,
your devoted Julie.

07:17.770 --> 07:21.139
<i>Satan has asked to sift
all of you as wheat.</i>

07:21.141 --> 07:22.641
<i>But I have prayed for you, Peter,</i>

07:22.643 --> 07:24.976
<i>that your faith may not fail.</i>

07:24.978 --> 07:27.338
<i>And when you have turned back,
you strengthen your brothers.</i>

07:28.214 --> 07:31.783
Peter, in answer, said to him,

07:31.785 --> 07:34.586
"Even if all men doubt you,

07:34.588 --> 07:36.655
I will never doubt you."

07:42.028 --> 07:44.729
And Jesus said Peter,

07:44.731 --> 07:48.667
"On this night, before the rooster crows,

07:48.669 --> 07:50.635
you will deny me three times."

08:19.966 --> 08:21.967
Did you miss me, Father?

08:21.969 --> 08:24.636
I've sinned again.

08:24.638 --> 08:28.106
It has been one week
since my last confession,

08:28.108 --> 08:30.809
and last week

08:30.811 --> 08:34.011
I have pleasured myself
with a cold cucumber.

08:35.815 --> 08:38.149
Oh, Father,

08:38.150 --> 08:43.288
the orgasm I experienced
was truly celestial.

08:43.289 --> 08:48.560
I had images of Christ
in my head as I was climaxing.

08:48.562 --> 08:50.795
Then I thought of you.

08:50.797 --> 08:52.297
Those eyes.

08:52.299 --> 08:55.934
What are they? Green? Hazel?

09:00.673 --> 09:04.209
I'm sorry for this
and all my past sins.

09:06.279 --> 09:09.581
For your penance I want you
to go to Mass every morning,

09:09.583 --> 09:11.616
say a prayer every night
before going to bed,

09:11.618 --> 09:13.585
and help a soul in need.

09:13.587 --> 09:14.920
All right.

09:14.922 --> 09:16.121
Now repeat after me.

09:16.123 --> 09:18.056
My God...

09:18.058 --> 09:20.859
My God...

09:20.861 --> 09:24.563
I am sorry for my sins
with all my heart.

09:24.565 --> 09:27.866
I am sorry for my sins
with all my heart.

09:27.868 --> 09:30.835
In choosing to do wrong
and failing to do good...

09:30.837 --> 09:33.705
In choosing to do wrong
and failing to do good...

09:33.707 --> 09:35.574
I have sinned against you,

09:35.576 --> 09:38.109
whom I should love
above all things.

09:38.111 --> 09:39.644
I have sinned against you

09:39.646 --> 09:41.613
whom I should love
above all things.

09:41.615 --> 09:44.115
- I firmly intend...
- I firmly intend...

09:44.117 --> 09:45.784
- With your help...
- With your help...

09:45.786 --> 09:47.619
- To do penance...
- To do penance...

09:47.621 --> 09:49.254
- To sin no more...
- To sin no more...

09:49.256 --> 09:51.156
- And to avoid...
- And to avoid...

09:51.158 --> 09:54.993
- Whatever leads me to sin.
- Whatever leads me to sin.

09:54.995 --> 09:58.129
Our savior Jesus Christ
suffered and died for us,

09:58.131 --> 10:00.031
in his name.

11:18.411 --> 11:20.779
So how are you holding up?

11:20.781 --> 11:23.114
It's been challenging, but

11:23.116 --> 11:25.684
I feel like I'm truly
doing God's work.

11:28.320 --> 11:31.823
They ask about you, you know.

11:31.825 --> 11:34.092
You touched many lives here.

11:34.094 --> 11:37.162
They touched mine too.

11:37.164 --> 11:40.198
Sometimes, though, I feel like...

11:40.200 --> 11:43.702
like they contaminated my soul, you know?

11:43.704 --> 11:46.337
That in the end I truly
understood them.

11:46.339 --> 11:50.341
Their sinful ways, their lust.

11:50.343 --> 11:53.311
You've been here too long Father.

11:53.313 --> 11:55.380
No one can fault you
for wanting a change.

11:55.382 --> 11:57.782
Nobody can do this forever.

11:57.784 --> 12:00.085
I kind of miss it now.

12:00.087 --> 12:02.420
Out there we're just collectors.

12:02.422 --> 12:05.757
It's all we seem to do.

12:05.759 --> 12:09.027
Sometimes I wonder, in eight years,

12:09.029 --> 12:11.162
did I really save anyone?

12:11.164 --> 12:13.098
Guide someone to the light?

12:15.000 --> 12:17.869
The Lord challenges us every day.

12:17.871 --> 12:20.238
We are constantly tested.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.807
So what is our role then?

12:22.809 --> 12:24.375
Take their money
and hold their hand

12:24.377 --> 12:26.444
as we all fail miserably to pass?

12:28.981 --> 12:31.349
I want to be tested.
Believe me, I want to.

13:45.926 --> 13:49.160
Father, please help me.

13:57.903 --> 13:59.170
Come with me.

14:02.609 --> 14:04.008
Shh.

14:07.514 --> 14:09.881
God. I'm calling an ambulance.

14:09.883 --> 14:11.182
No, don't. No, don't, please.

14:11.184 --> 14:13.251
Just let me stay here for a while.

14:40.413 --> 14:42.080
It's them.

14:42.082 --> 14:43.982
It's them.

14:43.984 --> 14:45.350
Stay here.

14:52.324 --> 14:54.392
What brings you here at this hour?

14:54.394 --> 14:57.195
We are looking for someone, Father.

14:57.197 --> 14:59.297
A big sinner.

14:59.299 --> 15:03.001
Might as well be the devil herself.

15:03.003 --> 15:05.637
In the house of the Lord,
no one stays invisible.

15:07.506 --> 15:09.574
You mind if we take a look?

15:09.576 --> 15:12.610
Go ahead.

15:19.486 --> 15:21.653
Are you a Catholic?

15:24.189 --> 15:26.925
Then show some respect, my son.
Bless yourself.

15:46.078 --> 15:49.480
Naughty, naughty.

15:49.482 --> 15:52.650
Father, you really have no idea
who you are dealing with.

15:52.652 --> 15:54.352
Boss.

16:33.492 --> 16:35.193
Thank you.

16:35.195 --> 16:36.427
You're welcome.

17:01.755 --> 17:03.755
Our Father, who art in heaven...

17:39.759 --> 17:42.193
Are you committed?

18:18.631 --> 18:21.332
Arise, oh God.

18:21.334 --> 18:23.267
Judge thy own cause.

18:27.473 --> 18:30.374
<i>Remember thy reproaches...</i>

18:30.376 --> 18:31.776
<i>With which the foolish man</i>

18:31.778 --> 18:33.845
<i>hath reproached thee all the day.</i>

19:08.381 --> 19:10.214
And then I told her she was stupid,

19:10.216 --> 19:11.749
but I didn't mean it.

19:11.751 --> 19:13.451
And then I gave her doll back.

19:14.687 --> 19:16.220
There now.

19:16.222 --> 19:18.556
You regret what you did. It's okay.

19:18.558 --> 19:22.293
Just say a Hail Mary
before you go to bed tonight,

19:22.295 --> 19:24.495
and God Almighty will forgive you.

19:24.497 --> 19:25.897
Thank you, Father.

19:37.276 --> 19:39.443
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

19:39.445 --> 19:41.245
I know.

19:41.247 --> 19:42.647
I'm pregnant.

19:48.520 --> 19:49.720
I, um...

19:51.323 --> 19:53.324
I have to ask.

19:53.326 --> 19:54.926
How do I know it's yours?

19:56.461 --> 19:58.763
That day I came to you for help,

19:58.765 --> 20:01.699
I decided to turn my life around.

20:01.701 --> 20:03.834
I promised myself
no more cheap thrills.

20:03.836 --> 20:05.937
Just life.

20:08.340 --> 20:10.808
But I know I'm not fit
to keep this child, so I...

20:10.810 --> 20:12.410
I'll leave today.

20:12.412 --> 20:15.346
I I promise I'll try
to pay you back somehow.

20:15.348 --> 20:17.548
No, I... don't.

20:24.957 --> 20:26.591
We'll leave together.

20:28.460 --> 20:31.329
I'm really not fit for this anymore.

20:31.331 --> 20:33.264
No, no, no, it's complicated.

20:33.266 --> 20:34.365
No, what?
What's complicated?

20:34.367 --> 20:35.600
They're gonna come after us.

20:35.602 --> 20:37.001
I still owe them money.

20:50.916 --> 20:52.516
How much?

20:54.920 --> 20:56.787
Twenty grand.

21:04.663 --> 21:06.564
Take this.

21:06.566 --> 21:09.667
Get yourself a room at the motel
next to the train station.

21:09.669 --> 21:12.837
We'll go first thing in the
morning and settle your debt.

21:12.839 --> 21:14.272
I I can't do this.

21:14.274 --> 21:15.740
Yes, you can, and you will.

21:40.532 --> 21:43.067
<i>Son of a bitch.</i>

21:43.069 --> 21:44.869
<i>Under the sink.</i>

21:44.871 --> 21:46.570
<i>Never saw that coming.</i>

21:47.906 --> 21:50.474
<i>Must have got some action.</i>

21:50.476 --> 21:51.876
<i>I'll give you a bonus, I suppose.</i>

21:55.347 --> 21:57.782
Burn it all down.

21:57.784 --> 21:58.883
Save yourself.

22:47.567 --> 22:50.368
<i>Burn it all down.</i>

22:50.370 --> 22:52.036
<i>Save yourself.</i>

23:23.568 --> 23:25.503
<i>Are you committed?</i>

24:49.488 --> 24:53.157
I think you are beyond saving.

24:53.159 --> 24:56.727
You've got friends in high places.

24:56.729 --> 24:59.597
That's the only reason you are here.

24:59.599 --> 25:02.967
But if your friends
think this is what you need,

25:02.969 --> 25:06.036
I'll show you the time of your life.

25:26.559 --> 25:30.661
Welcome to Monastero Saligia.

26:34.759 --> 26:36.026
Wake up.

26:40.366 --> 26:42.700
What did you do to her?

26:57.350 --> 27:00.384
I'm not sure what I find
more troubling,

27:00.386 --> 27:03.754
your current condition,
or your reading material.

27:06.191 --> 27:07.658
Holy shit.

27:07.660 --> 27:09.193
Charlie.

27:11.796 --> 27:15.399
From your host's handbook
for treating sinners.

27:15.401 --> 27:19.870
But then again, it does have a
fairly acceptable success rate.

27:19.872 --> 27:21.105
Untie me, Charlie.

27:21.107 --> 27:23.040
Of course.

27:23.042 --> 27:24.775
But first, can you tell me

27:24.777 --> 27:26.243
why do you think you were tied down?

27:26.245 --> 27:28.712
Um...

27:28.714 --> 27:32.650
some crazy nun tried to stab me
with a crucifix.

27:32.652 --> 27:33.751
Classic.

27:33.753 --> 27:35.119
I'm serious.

27:35.121 --> 27:36.887
Hmm.

27:44.329 --> 27:46.263
What was that all about?

27:47.165 --> 27:48.298
Vatican Intelligence.

27:56.909 --> 27:59.443
Prego, senor.

27:59.445 --> 28:01.211
Grazie.

28:04.949 --> 28:08.085
Best gelato in Rome.

28:08.087 --> 28:09.820
You like the view?

28:09.822 --> 28:13.057
It's all a bit overkill,
don't you think?

28:13.059 --> 28:15.726
Say what you will
about good old Benito,

28:15.728 --> 28:20.030
but he truly understood
the essence of religion.

28:20.032 --> 28:21.198
Who?

28:21.200 --> 28:22.933
Mussolini.

28:22.935 --> 28:24.234
Il Duce.

28:26.371 --> 28:27.905
If it wasn't for him,

28:27.907 --> 28:30.007
the Vatican wouldn't have its own state,

28:30.009 --> 28:33.277
and you would be rotting
in jail right now.

28:33.279 --> 28:37.014
Aggravated arson, hate crime.

28:37.016 --> 28:38.782
Ten years, I would say.

28:40.385 --> 28:41.885
It's a nice thought,

28:41.887 --> 28:43.887
owing your freedom to a dictator.

28:43.889 --> 28:47.291
Is that why you tried to kill yourself?

28:47.293 --> 28:50.094
You thought it would set you free.

28:50.096 --> 28:52.429
Because I got to tell you,

28:52.431 --> 28:55.833
there are much better reasons
on this God's earth,

28:55.835 --> 28:57.735
to give one's life away.

29:01.005 --> 29:04.208
Come, I'll buy you a drink instead.

29:18.057 --> 29:19.323
What is it gonna be, folks?

29:21.092 --> 29:23.293
Uh, Jack.

29:23.295 --> 29:25.362
You got it.

29:36.307 --> 29:38.375
There you go.

29:38.377 --> 29:40.310
Cheers... Jack.

29:40.312 --> 29:41.945
Cheers, Padre.

29:43.381 --> 29:44.381
There's no trick.

29:44.383 --> 29:46.950
I'm as blind as a bat.

29:49.053 --> 29:51.822
You're sitting in the bar that
could only be more run down

29:51.824 --> 29:53.223
since last time I saw it,

29:53.225 --> 29:54.958
which tells me you're not
from a family

29:54.960 --> 29:57.060
that would have a crest or a ring.

29:57.062 --> 30:00.030
You're in a deadbeat bar
on a Sunday afternoon,

30:00.032 --> 30:02.266
so you probably
ain't married either.

30:02.268 --> 30:04.968
Now, the ring could be rock and roll.

30:04.970 --> 30:07.104
Didn't sound hollow, though.
It sounded sharp,

30:07.106 --> 30:09.006
like it had something on top of it,

30:09.008 --> 30:13.043
like your skulls or your
sword, or a crucifix.

30:14.979 --> 30:17.181
Silence implies consent.

30:17.183 --> 30:19.082
Now, who's driving?
The other padre?

30:19.084 --> 30:21.051
Indeed. Orange juice, please.

30:21.053 --> 30:23.020
Oh, sure.

30:23.022 --> 30:26.156
The stories they tell of you,
they are no exaggeration.

30:26.158 --> 30:29.193
Sure they are.

30:29.195 --> 30:31.195
And if Jesus was alive today,

30:31.197 --> 30:33.564
he'd be doing magic tricks
at birthday parties

30:33.566 --> 30:35.465
and get booed off the stage.

30:35.467 --> 30:37.501
Don't buy into myths.

30:37.503 --> 30:40.537
I guess Father O.J. here is a local.

30:40.539 --> 30:43.207
How about you, son?

30:43.209 --> 30:45.509
What brings you
to the Eternal City?

30:45.511 --> 30:48.846
Okay, I think it's best
if we move to a table.

30:48.848 --> 30:50.080
Yeah.

30:50.082 --> 30:52.416
Okay.

30:52.418 --> 30:54.885
I'm just screwing with you boys.

30:54.887 --> 30:58.522
I mean, if you're
old enough to fuck,

30:58.524 --> 31:01.091
you're old enough
to be fucked with.

31:01.093 --> 31:03.460
Bye, Padre.

31:03.462 --> 31:05.629
I had to pull all the strings I ever held

31:05.631 --> 31:08.232
to get you in Saligia.

31:08.234 --> 31:10.000
Thank you.

31:10.002 --> 31:11.869
You'd better.

31:11.871 --> 31:14.610
If I hadn't, you would have
been excommunicated.

31:14.874 --> 31:17.507
It's starting to feel
inevitable, Charlie.

31:17.509 --> 31:19.409
Hmm.

31:19.411 --> 31:21.979
You're a good man.

31:21.981 --> 31:24.548
And only good men
get their hearts broken.

31:24.550 --> 31:27.284
Even by a whore?

31:27.286 --> 31:29.653
Especially by a whore.

31:29.655 --> 31:33.156
I was just trying to save her.

31:33.158 --> 31:35.959
But God had different plans.

31:35.961 --> 31:37.561
Like what?

31:39.597 --> 31:40.998
What the hell is this?

31:41.000 --> 31:42.566
We're not sure.
Something new.

31:42.568 --> 31:44.468
An underground group

31:44.470 --> 31:46.303
that champions anarchy
by way of terror,

31:46.305 --> 31:49.406
and whose focal point
is the Catholic Church.

31:49.408 --> 31:52.442
This graffiti, we tried
to identify them with the help

31:52.444 --> 31:55.445
of the best handwriting
experts in the world.

31:55.447 --> 31:57.481
We found some matches in Testaccio.

31:57.483 --> 32:01.451
That's Rome's most depraved neighborhood.

32:01.453 --> 32:06.189
Drugs, prostitution,
underground clubs of all kinds.

32:06.191 --> 32:08.692
But if you look at the writings, though,

32:08.694 --> 32:10.961
they are pretty interesting.

32:14.933 --> 32:15.933
Pelaguis.

32:15.935 --> 32:18.302
Mr. Freewill himself.

32:18.304 --> 32:21.038
This is not the work
of some angry kids.

32:21.040 --> 32:25.208
These are serious scholars.
Men of the cloth.

32:25.210 --> 32:27.277
Or at least they once were.

32:27.279 --> 32:29.713
You think they were expelled from Saligia.

32:29.715 --> 32:31.581
You see?

32:31.583 --> 32:33.984
I chose you for a reason.

32:33.986 --> 32:36.320
For what?

32:36.322 --> 32:39.589
This was photographed
a couple of years ago.

32:39.591 --> 32:43.327
One of the inmates wrote it
with his own shit.

32:43.329 --> 32:45.395
The same handwriting.

32:45.397 --> 32:47.531
- Who is he?
- We don't know.

32:47.533 --> 32:49.066
They never found the culprit,

32:49.068 --> 32:51.201
and obviously he is no longer there.

32:51.203 --> 32:53.136
But whoever he is,

32:53.138 --> 32:56.139
I'm convinced he's part
of a bigger group,

32:56.141 --> 32:59.609
backed by someone
with infinite resources.

32:59.611 --> 33:03.513
And I'm afraid they could pull
off something we can't foresee.

33:03.515 --> 33:07.317
Something of earth shattering
proportions.

33:07.319 --> 33:08.719
Like what?

33:08.721 --> 33:11.455
That's what I need you to find out.

33:11.457 --> 33:13.757
I need a man who can go under.

33:13.759 --> 33:15.726
Attract the ants,
find the queen,

33:15.728 --> 33:18.662
and see what she's after.

33:18.664 --> 33:20.163
Why me?

33:20.165 --> 33:21.665
Well, you're the perfect choice.

33:21.667 --> 33:23.600
You spent a decade with convicts,

33:23.602 --> 33:25.202
and run with your brother before that.

33:25.204 --> 33:26.436
I was just a kid.

33:26.438 --> 33:29.473
As tough a kid as I've ever seen.

33:29.475 --> 33:31.541
Thank God your mom let me
place you in the seminary.

33:31.543 --> 33:35.012
Can you imagine where
you would be if she hadn't?

33:35.014 --> 33:37.047
The point is, I'm the only one alive

33:37.049 --> 33:39.583
who knows how far you've come.

33:39.585 --> 33:42.619
God was truly by your side
when you needed him.

33:44.188 --> 33:45.489
You want to throw
your life away?

33:45.491 --> 33:47.591
Fine.

33:47.593 --> 33:50.127
But you have a chance
to rediscover your faith

33:50.129 --> 33:53.096
and to save yourself.

33:53.098 --> 33:55.632
Listen, you do this

33:55.634 --> 33:58.301
and I'll get you
an audience with the Pope.

33:58.303 --> 34:00.404
Personal pardon.

34:00.406 --> 34:03.340
Then you pick a post
anywhere in the world.

34:09.380 --> 34:11.281
<i>Where do I start?</i>

34:11.283 --> 34:14.083
<i>I've booked you a room in Testaccio.</i>

34:14.085 --> 34:15.752
<i>There's a map in the
folder that shows you</i>

34:15.754 --> 34:19.623
<i>where the most
relevant walls are.</i>

34:22.226 --> 34:24.161
Hi.

34:24.163 --> 34:26.530
Aside from that, all we know
is the leader's pseudonym.

34:26.532 --> 34:28.065
Sunday.

34:28.067 --> 34:30.233
- Sunday?
- Mm hmm.

34:30.235 --> 34:33.570
Great, that should make it
easy to ask around.

35:13.145 --> 35:16.580
"That we are able to do good is of God.

35:16.582 --> 35:20.817
That we actually do good
is of ourselves."

35:47.411 --> 35:50.313
"Day by day, hour by hour,

35:50.315 --> 35:54.417
we have to choose between good and evil."

36:00.893 --> 36:03.760
"The freedom to choose makes us like God.

36:03.762 --> 36:06.696
"If we choose evil,
that freedom becomes a curse.

36:06.698 --> 36:10.767
If we choose good, it becomes
our greatest blessing."

36:29.554 --> 36:31.254
<i>Mussolini.</i>

36:33.457 --> 36:35.892
<i>Il Duce.</i>

36:49.274 --> 36:50.740
Come on.

36:52.410 --> 36:53.877
Ciao, Santo.

38:14.458 --> 38:16.960
Duce! Duce! Duce!

38:16.962 --> 38:21.698
Duce! Duce! Duce!
Duce! Duce!

39:56.561 --> 39:58.428
Go! Go! Get help!

40:04.069 --> 40:05.869
<i>Duce!</i>

40:05.871 --> 40:07.504
If he was following her,

40:07.506 --> 40:08.838
then why would he defend her?

40:08.840 --> 40:10.473
You shouldn't have
brought him here.

40:10.475 --> 40:12.475
He saved me.
Doesn't that mean something?

40:12.477 --> 40:14.043
It proves...

40:14.045 --> 40:16.846
Enough. What happened to her
could happen to anybody.

40:16.848 --> 40:18.515
We're getting close.
We're all...

40:18.517 --> 40:19.916
So let's ask somebody.

40:19.918 --> 40:21.418
Why won't you tell us the plan?

40:21.420 --> 40:23.186
- Maybe he hasn't told you...
- He?

40:23.188 --> 40:24.788
- You don't know it's a he.
- I'm just saying.

40:24.790 --> 40:26.423
You don't know what you're saying.

40:26.425 --> 40:27.891
I know the plan,
but we're not ready.

40:27.893 --> 40:28.892
Not until he says so.

40:28.894 --> 40:30.160
So, what do we do now?

40:30.162 --> 40:32.195
We test his commitment.

40:32.197 --> 40:34.631
God knows we could use
more committed men.

40:34.633 --> 40:36.800
Where am I?

40:36.802 --> 40:40.670
Come, sit with us.

40:40.672 --> 40:42.839
Who were those men?

40:42.841 --> 40:44.974
I went to school with one of them.

40:44.976 --> 40:46.609
I have a Jewish last name.

40:46.611 --> 40:49.112
But my father left us,
and besides, my mother...

40:49.114 --> 40:52.949
All that matters
is that you're safe.

40:52.951 --> 40:55.051
Thanks to you.

40:56.821 --> 40:58.621
They need to be stopped.

40:58.623 --> 41:00.757
Tonight, we put a plan into action.

41:00.759 --> 41:03.059
One that will eradicate
all traces of thugs like that.

41:03.061 --> 41:05.829
One to destroy both the symptoms
and their cause.

41:05.831 --> 41:07.897
How?

41:07.899 --> 41:09.199
Excellent question.

41:09.201 --> 41:11.701
You're new here, aren't you?

41:11.703 --> 41:13.903
Been here a few days.

41:15.706 --> 41:18.241
Will you trust us tonight?

41:38.563 --> 41:42.532
To make you see.

43:05.282 --> 43:07.083
- Are you committed?
- Wake up.

43:28.706 --> 43:29.806
Hey.

43:50.227 --> 43:52.328
- Hi.
- Hi.

43:52.330 --> 43:53.663
Stay with me.

43:55.032 --> 43:57.066
Wait.

44:14.152 --> 44:15.985
You're late.

44:15.987 --> 44:17.820
Tough night again?

44:17.822 --> 44:19.722
- I'm sorry.
- What is going on?

44:19.724 --> 44:22.759
We wanted to formally
introduce ourselves.

44:22.761 --> 44:23.826
Monday.

44:23.828 --> 44:25.695
Tuesday.

44:25.697 --> 44:27.230
Wednesday.

44:27.232 --> 44:28.297
Friday.

44:28.299 --> 44:30.033
And I am Saturday.

44:32.904 --> 44:34.337
So, who are you?

44:34.339 --> 44:36.005
I'm... I'm Smith.

44:36.007 --> 44:38.074
That is your name, but who are you?

44:38.076 --> 44:39.709
Is he okay?

44:39.711 --> 44:41.444
Oh, he'll be all right.

44:41.446 --> 44:45.982
He's having a crisis of faith.
We're trying to save his soul.

44:45.984 --> 44:47.750
Repeat after me.

44:47.752 --> 44:50.219
Life was a fly that faded,

44:50.221 --> 44:52.955
and death the drone that stung.

44:52.957 --> 44:56.059
The world was very old indeed
when you and I were young.

44:56.061 --> 44:58.361
We have seen the city of Mansoul,

44:58.363 --> 45:00.396
even as it rocked relieved.

45:00.398 --> 45:02.265
Blessed are they who did not see,

45:02.267 --> 45:05.001
- but being blind...
- Believed.

45:06.137 --> 45:07.336
Believed.

45:09.039 --> 45:10.879
He's gonna die.
We need to call an ambulance.

45:16.214 --> 45:18.014
You believe in self sacrifice?

45:18.016 --> 45:21.951
Why, yes. A perfect way to call attention.

45:21.953 --> 45:24.253
Just ask your Christ Almighty.

45:24.255 --> 45:26.055
We're not insane.

45:26.057 --> 45:28.424
- Then what are you?
- They will call us terrorists,

45:28.426 --> 45:29.992
but we are warriors of change.

45:29.994 --> 45:31.761
Where are your weapons?

45:31.763 --> 45:34.297
A man's brain is his weapon.
We're heavily armed.

45:34.299 --> 45:36.499
He's losing too much blood.

45:36.501 --> 45:39.135
- He's gonna die.
- Friday.

45:39.137 --> 45:40.770
What's it to you
if he lives or dies?

45:40.772 --> 45:41.904
What?

45:41.906 --> 45:43.239
Who sent you?

45:43.241 --> 45:46.209
I can smell a priest,
and you stink.

45:46.211 --> 45:49.345
I was a priest, but I'm not anymore.

45:49.347 --> 45:51.948
They sent me here for rehab.

45:51.950 --> 45:53.516
But it was too late.

45:53.518 --> 45:55.184
I'd lost my faith already.

45:55.186 --> 45:57.453
I was excommunicated.

45:57.455 --> 45:59.255
You were in Saligia?

45:59.257 --> 46:02.191
Yeah.

46:02.193 --> 46:04.093
Come with me.

46:06.396 --> 46:08.397
I was a nun

46:08.399 --> 46:11.801
when I was assigned
to a mission in the Congo.

46:11.803 --> 46:14.470
One night we were in
this village near Misama,

46:14.472 --> 46:16.105
and in the middle of the night

46:16.107 --> 46:17.940
one of the priest crawls into my bed

46:17.942 --> 46:21.010
and whispers, "Are you wet?"

46:22.346 --> 46:25.281
I was so shocked
I couldn't open my mouth.

46:25.283 --> 46:27.850
And then he touched me.

46:27.852 --> 46:30.052
I tried to make him stop,
but he kept going.

46:30.054 --> 46:32.188
He kept forcing himself.

46:32.190 --> 46:35.224
I tried to scream.

46:35.226 --> 46:38.127
And then at some point...

46:38.129 --> 46:40.830
I just separated my mind from my body.

46:42.466 --> 46:44.500
And I realized it's the mind
that needs to be freed,

46:44.502 --> 46:47.336
not the body.

46:47.338 --> 46:49.238
I'm so sorry.

46:49.240 --> 46:51.474
He threatened to kill me
if I told anyone.

46:51.476 --> 46:53.209
I pretended to be in shock.

46:53.211 --> 46:55.444
And then when he finally
went back to his quarters,

46:55.446 --> 46:59.182
I got up, found the biggest
knife I could get my hands on,

46:59.184 --> 47:02.819
and butchered him in his sleep.

47:02.821 --> 47:04.887
And then I realized,

47:04.889 --> 47:07.490
God is a myth.

47:07.492 --> 47:11.227
It wasn't when he was raping
me... That's just my body.

47:11.229 --> 47:13.229
It was when I killed a man

47:13.231 --> 47:16.199
that I understood, it's just me.

47:16.201 --> 47:19.001
My decisions, my actions.

47:20.437 --> 47:22.004
We're all alone.

47:26.376 --> 47:28.945
And they sent you to Saligia?

47:28.947 --> 47:31.480
I managed to escape,

47:31.482 --> 47:34.116
thanks to one special man.

47:34.118 --> 47:37.186
And then, I decided to
put an end to it all.

47:38.355 --> 47:39.555
To change everything.

47:41.091 --> 47:42.425
Saturday!

47:45.530 --> 47:47.230
- How is he?
- Oh, relax.

47:47.232 --> 47:48.631
This man is gonna die

47:48.633 --> 47:50.132
if we don't take him
to a hospital right now.

47:50.134 --> 47:52.869
- Friday!
- Hey!

47:52.871 --> 47:54.904
Psychological anarchy
is a state of mind.

47:54.906 --> 47:57.240
There is only you and the
consequences of your actions.

47:57.242 --> 47:59.475
Are you willing to accept that?

47:59.477 --> 48:02.879
- Are you?
- Decisions, decisions.

48:02.881 --> 48:05.014
Okay. Okay, yes, I accept.

48:05.016 --> 48:07.116
Oh! I always love
difficult cases.

48:07.118 --> 48:10.286
- Now fucking do something.
- Already done.

48:10.288 --> 48:12.955
Come on.

48:12.957 --> 48:15.291
You will not say anything
about what you just saw.

48:15.293 --> 48:17.059
You're one of us now.
You'd better not let me down.

48:17.061 --> 48:18.527
- What?
- Friday!

48:23.333 --> 48:24.533
Hey.

48:24.535 --> 48:26.302
Hey, wake up.

48:27.571 --> 48:29.105
Come on, quickly.

48:31.675 --> 48:33.175
They're waiting for us.

48:33.177 --> 48:34.443
Stay with me.

48:51.262 --> 48:53.362
You're late.

48:53.364 --> 48:55.598
Tough night again?

48:55.600 --> 48:58.567
I'm sorry, what's going on?

48:58.569 --> 49:00.569
Wait a second, that's exactly
what I said to you

49:00.571 --> 49:03.172
before you formally
introduced yourselves.

49:05.676 --> 49:08.077
I'm going insane.

49:08.079 --> 49:10.212
Oh, no, you're not insane.

49:10.214 --> 49:11.647
You proved your sanity.
That's why you're here.

49:11.649 --> 49:13.416
You're one of the sane ones.

49:18.255 --> 49:19.722
Friday.

49:19.724 --> 49:21.590
Wednesday. Tuesday.

49:22.559 --> 49:24.026
I'm Saturday.

49:25.262 --> 49:26.329
Where's Monday?

49:26.331 --> 49:28.531
What is it to you?

49:28.533 --> 49:29.665
Where's Thursday?

49:29.667 --> 49:32.168
You're Thursday.

49:33.437 --> 49:35.738
- I chose you for a reason.
- For what?

49:39.477 --> 49:41.444
What's wrong with you?

49:41.446 --> 49:42.478
No, I'm just...

49:42.480 --> 49:43.713
Pull yourself together.

49:43.715 --> 49:45.748
You're key to the resistance.

49:45.750 --> 49:47.149
The resistance?

49:47.151 --> 49:49.085
Gruppo d'Azione Patriottica.

49:49.087 --> 49:53.022
We're gonna stop Mussolini
from corrupting the Church.

49:53.024 --> 49:54.390
If it wasn't for him,

49:54.392 --> 49:56.726
the Vatican wouldn't have
its own state.

50:00.330 --> 50:02.465
What day is it today?

50:02.467 --> 50:04.633
March 22nd.

50:04.635 --> 50:06.335
What year?

50:07.371 --> 50:08.738
What year?

50:08.740 --> 50:11.240
1942.

50:11.242 --> 50:12.742
I'm dreaming.

50:12.744 --> 50:14.777
- This is a dream.
- Feels like it, doesn't it?

50:14.779 --> 50:16.379
No, no, no,
I mean I'm dreaming now.

50:16.381 --> 50:18.280
I'm actually asleep,
and this is a dream.

50:18.282 --> 50:19.548
I'm making this up.

50:21.351 --> 50:23.386
Just fucking say something!

50:23.388 --> 50:25.154
They found us!

50:25.156 --> 50:26.322
There must be another mole.

50:26.324 --> 50:28.157
No, no, it cannot be him.

50:28.159 --> 50:29.759
He's the only one
that's ever been here.

50:32.130 --> 50:33.162
Come on.

50:38.336 --> 50:40.102
Friday, torch it.

50:46.744 --> 50:48.577
Are you committed?

50:51.214 --> 50:53.049
Yeah.

50:53.051 --> 50:56.318
Good. I need you to lead them astray.
Now, run.

50:56.320 --> 50:57.820
Go!

51:32.355 --> 51:33.789
Quick, through here.

52:04.554 --> 52:06.255
Aah!

52:08.392 --> 52:09.692
Jack?

52:09.694 --> 52:11.193
Bull's eye.

52:11.195 --> 52:12.695
Still got it, Padre.

52:16.366 --> 52:19.301
So, you want to tell me
what happened to you last night?

52:19.303 --> 52:20.769
What do you mean?

52:20.771 --> 52:22.271
You busted in all wet,

52:22.273 --> 52:23.806
smelling like you
rolled in the gutter,

52:23.808 --> 52:28.244
murmuring "Death to Il Duce,
freedom to the people."

52:28.246 --> 52:31.347
That was the partisan slogan
in World War II.

52:31.349 --> 52:32.848
- Wait, what?
- I said that?

52:32.850 --> 52:35.317
Just before you drank yourself
into submission.

52:37.187 --> 52:38.220
I think I found them.

52:38.222 --> 52:39.388
Found who?

52:39.390 --> 52:40.789
The group.

52:40.791 --> 52:42.391
I think they were trying to test me,

52:42.393 --> 52:45.561
and then police showed up.

52:45.563 --> 52:46.729
And then we all ran.

52:47.864 --> 52:49.331
Everyone but Monday.

52:49.333 --> 52:51.934
You okay, Padre?
You seem lost.

52:51.936 --> 52:53.636
Well, I I am lost.

52:53.638 --> 52:56.338
I I don't know what
to believe anymore.

52:56.340 --> 52:58.674
Good old crisis of faith.

52:58.676 --> 53:00.476
Been there.

53:00.478 --> 53:02.845
I lost both my eyes for God and country,

53:02.847 --> 53:04.880
and had to learn the hard way

53:04.882 --> 53:10.419
there's only me and the
consequences of my actions.

53:10.421 --> 53:11.921
We're all alone.

53:14.424 --> 53:16.225
Where did you hear that?

53:16.227 --> 53:19.228
Hear what?

53:19.230 --> 53:23.232
Just trying to interpret
what you said last night.

53:23.234 --> 53:25.701
"Death to Il Duce, freedom to the people."

53:25.703 --> 53:27.570
Il Duce was Mussolini's nickname.

53:27.572 --> 53:29.672
It means, "the leader."

53:29.674 --> 53:33.475
Maybe you think we should be
careful who we chose to follow.

53:33.477 --> 53:36.745
Maybe you think
there is no leader at all.

53:36.747 --> 53:40.549
Yes, that's exactly it.

53:40.551 --> 53:42.384
There's no Sunday.

53:42.386 --> 53:43.586
Thanks, Jack.

53:43.588 --> 53:45.754
Thanks. Uh, got to run.

54:00.704 --> 54:04.473
So, what did you find?

54:04.475 --> 54:07.576
I'm, uh... I'm Thursday.

54:09.813 --> 54:10.879
You can't be.

54:10.881 --> 54:12.781
I am.

54:12.783 --> 54:14.283
The former Thursday quit,

54:14.285 --> 54:17.353
and they inducted me
the new Thursday.

54:17.355 --> 54:18.520
Who did?

54:18.522 --> 54:20.656
Saturday. She's the leader.

54:20.658 --> 54:24.660
You were right, looks like
they're all former Saligia.

54:24.662 --> 54:28.030
Saturday?
She can't be the leader.

54:28.032 --> 54:30.432
Listen, I'm pretty certain
she is the leader.

54:30.434 --> 54:32.534
Sunday is the leader.

54:32.536 --> 54:34.436
No, there was no Sunday.

54:34.438 --> 54:35.971
And no Thursday either.

54:35.973 --> 54:38.307
That woman ran the whole show.

54:38.309 --> 54:39.942
She is the leader.

54:39.944 --> 54:43.445
And even if there is a Sunday,
he's just a...

54:43.447 --> 54:44.947
I don't know, okay?

54:47.584 --> 54:50.786
I was passed out
in front of a bar this morning.

54:50.788 --> 54:53.022
I had this weird nightmare.

54:53.024 --> 54:54.890
Are you sure you even met them?

54:54.892 --> 54:56.992
Of course I did...

54:56.994 --> 54:58.994
I think.

54:58.996 --> 55:01.030
So, nothing on Sunday.

55:01.032 --> 55:03.565
There is no Sunday.

55:03.567 --> 55:06.969
You believe there is no Sunday?

55:31.728 --> 55:33.896
Carlo, great to see you.

55:33.898 --> 55:35.497
How are you, Ispettore?

55:44.674 --> 55:46.709
Excuse us, Ispettore. Let's go.

55:51.115 --> 55:54.717
I was here last night.

55:54.719 --> 55:56.452
She wrote the poem with his blood.

55:56.454 --> 55:58.587
I thought it was just...

55:58.589 --> 56:00.589
Oh, Lord, did they actually kill them?

56:00.591 --> 56:03.792
- Who?
- Monday.

56:03.794 --> 56:08.130
Thursday was found dead last month

56:08.132 --> 56:10.399
floating lifeless in the river.

56:10.401 --> 56:11.667
What?

56:14.604 --> 56:16.105
Why didn't you tell me?

56:16.107 --> 56:17.806
I think they thought
he was a mole.

56:17.808 --> 56:19.541
Relax.

56:19.543 --> 56:21.143
It seems someone is feeding her
with false information.

56:21.145 --> 56:23.078
Who?

56:23.080 --> 56:24.747
It doesn't matter.

56:24.749 --> 56:29.385
What's important is that
your secret is safe with me.

56:29.387 --> 56:30.719
We need to find Sunday.

56:30.721 --> 56:32.121
We need to know
what they're after.

56:33.923 --> 56:36.658
Don't turn your back on God.

56:36.660 --> 56:38.026
Why?

56:38.028 --> 56:40.562
He sure as hell
turned his back on me.

56:40.564 --> 56:45.534
Because you should have faith
in your own righteousness.

56:45.536 --> 56:48.837
And if you believe you can
right your wrongdoings,

56:48.839 --> 56:50.839
then you can do it for other people.

56:52.709 --> 56:54.943
Do you believe you can
right your wrongdoings?

56:56.880 --> 56:59.481
Yes.

56:59.483 --> 57:02.451
Well, then you believe in God.

58:22.166 --> 58:24.700
You were supposed
to take me to her.

58:24.702 --> 58:26.001
What? Take you to who?

58:26.003 --> 58:27.636
Saturday.

58:27.638 --> 58:28.804
She told me that you'd
know where she is.

58:28.806 --> 58:29.838
No, I don't. Why would I?

58:29.840 --> 58:31.740
Don't fuck with me, boy!

58:31.742 --> 58:34.910
I'm gonna shoot you
right here, right now,

58:34.912 --> 58:36.044
and I'm gonna tell her
you're the mole.

58:36.046 --> 58:37.980
No, no.

59:08.646 --> 59:09.645
Charles.

59:09.647 --> 59:10.979
Hmm.

59:10.981 --> 59:16.318
No bruises.
Just painful memories.

59:16.320 --> 59:19.054
Imperative to your
ultimate success.

59:21.025 --> 59:22.991
Good.

59:24.093 --> 59:28.263
I'm sorry about this,
but they are getting paranoid.

59:28.265 --> 59:31.333
They could never suspect you.
You're doing a remarkable job.

59:31.335 --> 59:33.135
Where are we?

59:33.137 --> 59:34.570
What is this?

59:34.572 --> 59:36.939
Friday was also our agent,

59:36.941 --> 59:39.107
but he lost his nerve.

59:39.109 --> 59:43.312
He was gonna gun Saturday down
before she did him.

59:43.314 --> 59:48.016
So we set up the meeting
on the bridge, as a test.

59:48.018 --> 59:50.719
He failed.

59:50.721 --> 59:53.755
Saturday can't be compromised.

59:53.757 --> 59:56.024
We're gonna drop you
next to her house,

59:56.026 --> 59:59.027
and you tell her
we surprised you at the bridge.

59:59.029 --> 01:00:00.963
There was a shootout,

01:00:00.965 --> 01:00:03.999
and Friday, in his dying breath...

01:00:04.001 --> 01:00:05.834
- What?
- ...told you to find her

01:00:05.836 --> 01:00:06.935
and warn her.

01:00:06.937 --> 01:00:08.337
You know where Saturday is?

01:00:08.339 --> 01:00:10.372
Of course.

01:00:10.374 --> 01:00:11.707
I told you...

01:00:14.210 --> 01:00:17.713
the mission is Sunday!

01:00:20.350 --> 01:00:23.151
You must convince her
to lead you to him.

01:00:23.153 --> 01:00:25.287
Why would she believe me?

01:00:25.289 --> 01:00:27.189
No, no.

01:00:29.093 --> 01:00:32.861
Because you're a hero.

01:00:32.863 --> 01:00:35.197
You jumped out of the
ambulance and escaped.

01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:38.667
<i>Don't worry.</i>

01:00:38.669 --> 01:00:40.736
Tuesday will find you

01:00:40.738 --> 01:00:43.405
and deliver you to her.

01:00:43.407 --> 01:00:47.209
Long live Il Duce.

01:01:43.233 --> 01:01:45.867
Relax, it's me, it's me.

01:01:45.869 --> 01:01:47.135
It's me.

01:01:52.776 --> 01:01:54.142
How the fuck did I get here?

01:01:54.144 --> 01:01:56.244
I had Tuesday follow you
from your motel.

01:01:56.246 --> 01:01:57.813
She picked you up
on the side of the road

01:01:57.815 --> 01:02:00.115
after you jumped out
of a moving ambulance.

01:02:00.117 --> 01:02:02.884
We suspected Friday
was an informer.

01:02:02.886 --> 01:02:04.886
I told him you were gonna
bring him to me.

01:02:04.888 --> 01:02:06.388
Tuesday saw the whole thing.

01:02:06.390 --> 01:02:08.223
Said Friday walked you into a trap,

01:02:08.225 --> 01:02:11.226
shot you in the arm,
but you managed to escape.

01:02:11.228 --> 01:02:12.928
Why did you have me followed?

01:02:12.930 --> 01:02:14.396
Why would you use me as bait?

01:02:14.398 --> 01:02:16.231
I didn't know if I could
trust you or not.

01:02:16.233 --> 01:02:17.432
I wanted to make sure
you were committed.

01:02:17.434 --> 01:02:19.201
Committed to what?

01:02:19.203 --> 01:02:22.003
Do you even know
what the mission is?

01:02:22.005 --> 01:02:23.071
Did Sunday tell you
what we're after?

01:02:23.073 --> 01:02:25.407
No.

01:02:25.409 --> 01:02:27.776
What is it that you want?

01:02:27.778 --> 01:02:30.245
What is this insanity really about?

01:02:30.247 --> 01:02:32.314
Destroying the system?

01:02:32.316 --> 01:02:33.915
Abolishing the Church?

01:02:33.917 --> 01:02:35.517
- What?
- Church.

01:02:35.519 --> 01:02:37.786
I want to abolish God.

01:02:37.788 --> 01:02:40.288
- God?
- Yes.

01:02:40.290 --> 01:02:42.758
I thought that you...
you didn't think he existed.

01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:45.761
I think he's a myth,

01:02:45.763 --> 01:02:47.362
but myths exist.

01:02:47.364 --> 01:02:49.164
Did you ever see God?

01:02:49.166 --> 01:02:51.366
Did you ever see Sunday?

01:02:51.368 --> 01:02:54.169
I don't believe in creating
anarchy to achieve a goal.

01:02:54.171 --> 01:02:55.771
If you have your own agenda,

01:02:55.773 --> 01:02:58.306
all you'll eventually do
is create a new system.

01:02:58.308 --> 01:03:00.108
People rise up for their rights.

01:03:00.110 --> 01:03:02.944
I denounce rights
and I denounce wrongs.

01:03:02.946 --> 01:03:05.080
When I'm through,
there will be no God,

01:03:05.082 --> 01:03:07.115
there will be no system.

01:03:07.117 --> 01:03:10.819
There will be nothing.

01:03:10.821 --> 01:03:13.555
Ashes to ashes.
Dust to dust.

01:03:19.396 --> 01:03:21.396
Freedom.

01:03:51.061 --> 01:03:52.828
No.

01:03:52.830 --> 01:03:54.262
You keep it.

01:03:58.368 --> 01:04:00.001
What's wrong?

01:04:01.370 --> 01:04:04.906
Been having these weird dreams

01:04:04.908 --> 01:04:07.175
ever since I got here.

01:04:09.111 --> 01:04:11.213
I just don't know
what's real anymore.

01:04:17.954 --> 01:04:20.021
Who is Sunday?

01:04:21.123 --> 01:04:22.991
There is no Sunday.

01:04:24.293 --> 01:04:25.927
I made him up.

01:04:43.613 --> 01:04:46.448
Shit.

01:04:46.450 --> 01:04:49.651
I tried to protect you.

01:04:50.953 --> 01:04:53.021
If there is no Sunday,

01:04:53.023 --> 01:04:56.658
it's her that needs to be stopped.

01:05:06.002 --> 01:05:08.169
You saved me.

01:05:12.241 --> 01:05:14.242
Go on, get out of here.

01:05:15.611 --> 01:05:17.245
I'll clean it up.

01:05:17.247 --> 01:05:20.315
We'll meet in this bar
in exactly 48 hours.

01:05:20.317 --> 01:05:23.184
You, me, and Wednesday.

01:05:23.186 --> 01:05:25.120
We can finish this job,

01:05:25.122 --> 01:05:27.355
blow Il Duce to pieces
once and for all. Come on.

01:05:31.628 --> 01:05:34.062
<i>Are you a tool of God, Father?</i>

01:05:35.531 --> 01:05:39.434
<i>I want to be tested.
Believe me, I want to.</i>

01:05:39.436 --> 01:05:41.269
<i>You do this, and I'll get you</i>

01:05:41.271 --> 01:05:42.470
<i>an audience with the pope.</i>

01:05:42.472 --> 01:05:44.406
<i>Personal pardon.</i>

01:05:44.408 --> 01:05:48.043
<i>Do you believe you can right
your wrongdoings?</i>

01:05:48.045 --> 01:05:50.111
<i>When I'm through,
there will be no God.</i>

01:05:50.113 --> 01:05:52.080
<i>There will be no system.</i>

01:05:52.082 --> 01:05:55.083
<i>There will be nothing!</i>

01:05:55.085 --> 01:05:58.119
<i>There are much better
reasons on this God's earth</i>

01:05:58.121 --> 01:06:00.956
<i>to give one's life away.</i>

01:06:00.958 --> 01:06:04.225
<i>Save yourself.
Save yourself.</i>

01:06:54.043 --> 01:06:56.144
There you are.

01:06:58.181 --> 01:07:02.784
I've been worried sick about you.

01:07:21.470 --> 01:07:22.737
Sugar?

01:07:23.672 --> 01:07:25.106
Scotch.

01:07:27.576 --> 01:07:29.577
So, what did you find?

01:07:31.147 --> 01:07:33.181
I'm tired of this.

01:07:33.183 --> 01:07:34.516
I want to wake up.

01:07:34.518 --> 01:07:37.218
- Wake up from what?
- I'm dreaming.

01:07:37.220 --> 01:07:39.154
This is not real.

01:07:39.156 --> 01:07:40.422
This table is not real.

01:07:40.424 --> 01:07:42.090
This horrible tea is not real.

01:07:42.092 --> 01:07:44.826
You're not real.
This jacket is not...

01:07:44.828 --> 01:07:46.795
Shh!

01:07:46.797 --> 01:07:49.264
Calm down. Have you lost your mind?

01:07:50.166 --> 01:07:51.533
Oh, my God.

01:07:51.535 --> 01:07:52.801
I thought it was a dream.

01:07:54.236 --> 01:07:56.071
I thought it was a nightmare.

01:07:56.073 --> 01:07:58.473
But they're actually all dead, aren't they?

01:07:58.475 --> 01:08:00.341
Monday was a mole.

01:08:00.343 --> 01:08:02.143
You're a mole.

01:08:02.145 --> 01:08:05.346
And Tuesday, and Friday, and me.

01:08:05.348 --> 01:08:07.749
How many of us were working for you?

01:08:07.751 --> 01:08:09.117
Hmm.

01:08:09.119 --> 01:08:11.286
Everyone.

01:08:11.288 --> 01:08:13.421
Except Saturday and Sunday.

01:08:13.423 --> 01:08:16.591
And still, we have
no identity on Sunday.

01:08:16.593 --> 01:08:18.526
Nothing. Who is he?

01:08:25.135 --> 01:08:28.603
There is no Sunday.
She made him up.

01:08:29.705 --> 01:08:31.606
She's making a bomb.

01:08:31.608 --> 01:08:33.508
She wants to blow up Il Duce.

01:08:37.212 --> 01:08:38.779
- You too.
- And if you're right,

01:08:38.782 --> 01:08:40.582
he is gonna personally decorate you.

01:08:40.584 --> 01:08:41.850
I give you my word.

01:08:41.852 --> 01:08:44.519
Wait, wait, just let me use the restroom.

01:09:04.506 --> 01:09:05.773
Okay.

01:09:16.585 --> 01:09:17.785
Come on, kid.

01:09:17.787 --> 01:09:20.822
I've got the SWAT team waiting.

01:09:20.823 --> 01:09:22.924
It's your big moment.

01:10:46.609 --> 01:10:48.543
Take her to Saligia tonight.

01:10:48.545 --> 01:10:51.813
Saligia?
She attacked my men.

01:10:51.815 --> 01:10:53.548
You just stopped
an assassination attempt

01:10:53.550 --> 01:10:55.283
against the Pope.

01:10:55.285 --> 01:10:56.884
I think it's a matter
best left for the Vatican.

01:10:56.886 --> 01:10:59.020
The last thing you want
is this making the news.

01:10:59.022 --> 01:11:01.389
Are we clear?

01:11:26.449 --> 01:11:27.915
So...

01:11:27.917 --> 01:11:29.450
you get to meet the Pope.

01:11:30.519 --> 01:11:34.522
Il Duce, holy dude numero uno.

01:11:34.524 --> 01:11:36.958
Thought I was lost
when I got here, but...

01:11:38.428 --> 01:11:40.361
...crisis ongoing.

01:11:40.363 --> 01:11:42.830
When you're sitting behind
the bar for as long as I have,

01:11:42.832 --> 01:11:45.500
you come to learn one thing:
we're all the same.

01:11:45.502 --> 01:11:49.304
We are mice on a boat to nowhere.

01:11:49.306 --> 01:11:51.472
One day the water's gonna break in,

01:11:51.474 --> 01:11:52.907
we're all gonna go under

01:11:52.909 --> 01:11:55.877
when the big flood hits again.

01:11:55.879 --> 01:11:58.646
So, not one righteous man, huh?

01:11:58.648 --> 01:12:00.748
Not even one.

01:12:00.750 --> 01:12:02.750
Here's my advice.

01:12:02.752 --> 01:12:05.653
Wear your cloth, do your job,

01:12:05.655 --> 01:12:06.921
get paid.

01:12:07.923 --> 01:12:09.624
You just saved the Pope.

01:12:09.626 --> 01:12:10.925
You will be remembered.

01:12:10.927 --> 01:12:13.561
You, my friend,

01:12:13.563 --> 01:12:15.997
have achieved immortality.

01:12:17.933 --> 01:12:19.634
Of course, if you killed the Pope,

01:12:19.636 --> 01:12:21.803
you'd be even harder to forget.

01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:26.974
I got to take a leak.

01:13:01.610 --> 01:13:03.711
Jesus Christ, what are you doing here?

01:13:03.713 --> 01:13:05.113
No, what are you doing here?

01:13:05.115 --> 01:13:06.714
What do you mean?

01:13:06.716 --> 01:13:08.716
You think I like these piercings? Huh?

01:13:08.718 --> 01:13:10.852
These stinky clothes?

01:13:10.854 --> 01:13:13.554
Look at me.
I am a man of God.

01:13:13.556 --> 01:13:16.657
I've done this for two years,
and when I almost got to him,

01:13:16.659 --> 01:13:18.393
you just got to...

01:13:21.030 --> 01:13:23.865
She was gonna introduce us
to the devil himself tonight,

01:13:23.867 --> 01:13:25.900
- and you turned her in.
- Sunday?

01:13:25.902 --> 01:13:27.702
Don't pretend you didn't know.

01:13:27.704 --> 01:13:29.604
You're a double agent.
You work for him.

01:13:29.606 --> 01:13:33.441
- No, no, I swear.
- Where is Sunday?

01:13:33.443 --> 01:13:34.542
Charles, VIS.

01:13:34.544 --> 01:13:36.577
I work for Charles.
Only him.

01:13:36.579 --> 01:13:37.745
Carlo?

01:13:37.747 --> 01:13:39.414
You work for Carlo too?

01:13:57.533 --> 01:14:00.902
I can't believe
you survived the explosion.

01:14:00.904 --> 01:14:03.805
It's a miracle.

01:14:03.807 --> 01:14:07.175
His Holiness will thank you personally

01:14:07.177 --> 01:14:10.678
and pardon you once you get well.

01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:11.946
How's Jack?

01:14:11.948 --> 01:14:13.915
Jack isn't gonna make it, kid.

01:14:13.917 --> 01:14:15.450
Why?

01:14:15.452 --> 01:14:18.953
Well, maybe it's his lack of faith.

01:14:18.955 --> 01:14:21.823
No, Jack has faith.

01:14:21.825 --> 01:14:24.659
Only his faith isn't blind.

01:14:24.661 --> 01:14:28.529
He doesn't buy into concepts,
God, the devil, religion.

01:14:28.531 --> 01:14:32.066
He simply believes in live and let live.

01:14:32.068 --> 01:14:34.168
Mm hmm.

01:14:34.170 --> 01:14:38.206
Some kind of faith may be good...

01:14:40.242 --> 01:14:42.176
for mosquitoes.

01:14:43.879 --> 01:14:48.516
Men are perpetual sinners
in need of constant order.

01:14:48.518 --> 01:14:51.219
Yeah, I don't know, Charlie.

01:14:51.221 --> 01:14:54.722
Perhaps if God showed himself
every once in a while,

01:14:54.724 --> 01:14:58.593
it'd be easier for the
common man to believe.

01:14:58.595 --> 01:15:00.628
And maybe we wouldn't sin so much.

01:15:00.630 --> 01:15:03.064
And how would that help Jack?

01:15:04.666 --> 01:15:07.802
Even if God made himself present,

01:15:07.804 --> 01:15:09.704
he would not be able to see.

01:15:12.774 --> 01:15:14.976
Get some sleep, son.

01:15:17.013 --> 01:15:20.815
You'll become a new hero.

01:15:22.084 --> 01:15:24.619
Saint Smith.

01:15:40.969 --> 01:15:42.103
Jack?

01:15:44.072 --> 01:15:46.173
Jack?

01:15:46.175 --> 01:15:49.110
Nurse!

01:15:49.112 --> 01:15:50.211
Jack.

01:15:52.114 --> 01:15:53.614
Jesus Christ.

01:15:54.984 --> 01:15:57.818
You all right?
I thought you were dying.

01:15:57.820 --> 01:15:59.287
Can I get you anything?

01:15:59.289 --> 01:16:01.923
Whiskey, thank you very much.

01:16:06.128 --> 01:16:09.764
Jack, I know who you are.

01:16:10.799 --> 01:16:13.601
I know you're Sunday.

01:16:13.603 --> 01:16:17.138
You are him, and you can see.

01:16:17.140 --> 01:16:19.774
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

01:16:21.043 --> 01:16:24.245
I can't see.

01:16:26.582 --> 01:16:27.682
I...

01:16:31.019 --> 01:16:32.887
I'm scared.

01:16:33.989 --> 01:16:36.824
I'm so fucking scared.

01:16:38.093 --> 01:16:40.361
I see God.

01:16:45.168 --> 01:16:47.802
If I fear him so much,

01:16:47.804 --> 01:16:51.172
what am I gonna feel
about the devil, Father?

01:16:52.608 --> 01:16:54.909
Please tell me.

01:16:54.911 --> 01:16:56.711
What do you think?

01:16:59.082 --> 01:17:03.250
No. No. No.

01:17:03.252 --> 01:17:04.719
No!

01:17:04.721 --> 01:17:06.687
Nurse!

01:17:48.798 --> 01:17:50.398
Cleanse them of their sins

01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:53.267
and fulfill their ardent desires,

01:17:53.269 --> 01:17:55.736
that maybe made worthy to behold,

01:17:55.738 --> 01:17:59.440
be face to face in thy glory.

01:17:59.442 --> 01:18:01.809
Stop.

01:18:01.811 --> 01:18:04.111
Huh.

01:18:04.113 --> 01:18:06.847
The new saint has arrived.

01:18:06.849 --> 01:18:08.916
How did she die?

01:18:08.918 --> 01:18:11.252
She killed herself, obviously.

01:18:11.254 --> 01:18:13.087
Ever the true believer.

01:18:13.089 --> 01:18:17.091
Nothing like self sacrifice
to hammer home your cause.

01:18:17.093 --> 01:18:19.293
She didn't have a cause.

01:18:20.862 --> 01:18:22.730
Chaos is also a cause.

01:18:27.769 --> 01:18:33.307
She had some lethal poison
prepared for the occasion.

01:18:34.911 --> 01:18:37.478
Turns out she really
knew her chemicals.

01:18:39.047 --> 01:18:41.849
She wanted to make a statement,

01:18:41.851 --> 01:18:44.251
but no one will ever even know
who she was.

01:18:47.222 --> 01:18:49.724
The Church will eradicate her from history.

01:18:49.726 --> 01:18:52.326
We cover what we must,

01:18:52.328 --> 01:18:54.128
or what we can.

01:18:54.130 --> 01:18:56.330
If she had succeeded, it would
have been very different.

01:18:56.332 --> 01:18:59.033
But if she didn't exist,

01:18:59.035 --> 01:19:00.868
then who did I stop?

01:19:00.870 --> 01:19:02.737
That's a very good question,

01:19:02.739 --> 01:19:05.039
but better keep it to yourself.

01:19:05.041 --> 01:19:08.476
Or you'll be the one
hammered to the cross.

01:19:15.485 --> 01:19:17.752
Can you believe?

01:19:19.154 --> 01:19:21.822
She had no heart.

01:19:26.529 --> 01:19:28.329
Wake up, son.

01:19:28.331 --> 01:19:31.999
The Pope wants to bless you.

01:20:07.335 --> 01:20:10.838
What's wrong, kid?

01:20:10.840 --> 01:20:13.007
She would've never made it.

01:20:13.009 --> 01:20:15.843
So, have you thought about
your next destination?

01:20:15.845 --> 01:20:18.412
I'd actually like to stay
here for a while.

01:20:18.414 --> 01:20:21.148
Bask in the corrupt glory of Rome.

01:20:22.351 --> 01:20:23.851
Watch it.

01:20:23.853 --> 01:20:25.586
Is this really the city of God?

01:20:25.588 --> 01:20:30.157
Or is it the one bought and paid
for by a fascist dictator?

01:20:30.159 --> 01:20:33.527
Silent consent for the murder
of millions to build Holy See.

01:20:36.598 --> 01:20:39.266
If we could change the system
from within, Charles,

01:20:39.268 --> 01:20:41.502
but I really want to believe.

01:20:41.504 --> 01:20:44.538
I want to with all my heart.

01:20:44.540 --> 01:20:46.273
But if not,

01:20:46.275 --> 01:20:49.210
I'm just not that interested anymore.

01:20:49.212 --> 01:20:50.611
Well, you're being tested, kid,

01:20:50.613 --> 01:20:52.613
but I still like your chances.

01:20:52.615 --> 01:20:54.548
Saturday didn't voice
her criticism, all right?

01:20:54.550 --> 01:20:56.884
She wasn't entirely wrong.

01:20:56.886 --> 01:20:59.520
- We can and we should evolve!
- Come on.

01:21:00.622 --> 01:21:02.890
Saturday was a lunatic,

01:21:02.892 --> 01:21:05.459
a psychiatry case
that needed to be treated.

01:21:05.461 --> 01:21:09.263
Inventing Sunday, how
delusionally brilliant.

01:21:09.265 --> 01:21:11.232
We just let her operate freely

01:21:11.234 --> 01:21:14.869
to find a leader that doesn't exist,

01:21:14.871 --> 01:21:18.439
because there was no Sunday, was there?

01:21:20.308 --> 01:21:22.943
If one person is delusional,

01:21:22.945 --> 01:21:25.012
it's a psychiatric case.

01:21:25.014 --> 01:21:27.348
If a lot of people are,

01:21:27.350 --> 01:21:29.383
it's religion.

01:21:32.988 --> 01:21:35.456
Go get your blessing.

01:21:45.634 --> 01:21:49.036
His Holiness will see you now.

01:21:55.011 --> 01:21:56.377
Holy Father.

01:21:58.313 --> 01:22:00.681
You helped uncover a plot to kill me,

01:22:00.683 --> 01:22:02.416
for which I'm grateful.

01:22:02.418 --> 01:22:04.685
I prayed for your soul.

01:22:04.687 --> 01:22:07.421
I hear from Charles

01:22:07.423 --> 01:22:11.158
you have failed others in your life.

01:22:12.994 --> 01:22:15.262
Am I a lost cause?

01:22:18.466 --> 01:22:23.671
Faith is being certain
of that which can be proven.

01:22:23.673 --> 01:22:28.142
A true believer makes his eyes
blind to temptation,

01:22:28.144 --> 01:22:32.046
so that his heart can
lead him to the divine.

01:22:32.048 --> 01:22:35.616
Do you believe even a blind man
can find his way

01:22:35.618 --> 01:22:37.618
from darkness into light?

01:22:42.624 --> 01:22:45.125
Your faith is strong.

01:22:50.165 --> 01:22:53.534
May I be so bold as to ask,
Your Holiness?

01:22:53.536 --> 01:22:56.704
This belonged to someone I...

01:22:56.706 --> 01:22:58.305
I cared about.

01:23:02.111 --> 01:23:04.378
Would you bless it?

01:23:17.326 --> 01:23:18.559
Is Your Holiness all right?

01:23:28.237 --> 01:23:29.703
Oh, my God.

01:23:30.672 --> 01:23:32.239
Oh, God. Oh, Lord.

01:23:35.010 --> 01:23:36.110
Oh!

01:23:36.112 --> 01:23:37.511
You keep it.

01:23:40.483 --> 01:23:42.549
No.

01:23:44.286 --> 01:23:45.786
No, no, I had nothing
to do with this.

01:23:45.788 --> 01:23:47.354
I know.

01:23:47.356 --> 01:23:50.557
We need to call an ambulance.

01:23:50.559 --> 01:23:52.593
No, Saturday gave me
the crucifix.

01:23:52.595 --> 01:23:55.295
I just wanted him to bless it,
pray for her soul.

01:23:55.297 --> 01:23:57.264
You need to go.

01:23:57.266 --> 01:24:00.034
Your freedom awaits you.

01:24:00.036 --> 01:24:02.503
Oh, God.

01:24:02.505 --> 01:24:04.271
It's you?

01:24:08.577 --> 01:24:11.345
You're Sunday.

01:24:11.347 --> 01:24:13.547
Why?

01:24:13.549 --> 01:24:16.050
Like you said, it's time to evolve.

01:24:16.052 --> 01:24:18.685
It will take a little
while, but it will happen.

01:24:18.687 --> 01:24:20.487
Now, before you go,

01:24:20.489 --> 01:24:22.656
would you be so kind

01:24:22.658 --> 01:24:26.493
and give me your best shot?

01:24:32.635 --> 01:24:34.201
Go.

01:24:34.203 --> 01:24:37.204
I'll give you a head start.

01:24:37.206 --> 01:24:40.607
Come on, come on!

01:24:57.726 --> 01:25:00.594
Get in! Come on!

01:25:00.596 --> 01:25:02.429
The Pope is dead.
You killed him.

01:25:02.431 --> 01:25:05.099
It was Sunday's doing,
all of it, I swear. Come on.

01:25:13.142 --> 01:25:15.309
You were dead.
I saw your corpse.

01:25:15.311 --> 01:25:16.777
He said you swallowed poison.

01:25:16.779 --> 01:25:18.679
There was also poison in the crucifix.

01:25:18.681 --> 01:25:21.148
Sunday gave it to me on the
day I got expelled from Saligia.

01:25:21.150 --> 01:25:23.283
I did not kill Monday
or the previous Thursday.

01:25:23.285 --> 01:25:25.552
He did.
He had Friday shot,

01:25:25.554 --> 01:25:27.321
and he planted the bomb in Jack's bar.

01:25:27.323 --> 01:25:29.289
It was all him.
You have to believe me.

01:25:29.291 --> 01:25:30.891
He was going to frame me
for the Pope's death

01:25:30.893 --> 01:25:32.493
and make you into a martyr.

01:25:32.495 --> 01:25:33.794
How the hell do you know all this?

01:25:33.796 --> 01:25:34.796
Hold on.

01:25:48.911 --> 01:25:50.711
Who are you?

01:25:50.713 --> 01:25:53.514
Given many religions recognize
God to be the judge,

01:25:53.516 --> 01:25:55.549
I guess I'd be prosecutor.

01:25:55.551 --> 01:25:57.451
Fuck me, you are crazy.

01:25:57.453 --> 01:25:59.186
You just accused me
of resurrecting myself

01:25:59.188 --> 01:26:01.288
from the dead... I'm crazy?

01:26:01.290 --> 01:26:03.390
Revelation 12:9,

01:26:03.392 --> 01:26:05.392
"This great dragon, the ancient serpent

01:26:05.394 --> 01:26:07.294
"called the devil, or Satan.

01:26:07.296 --> 01:26:10.397
"The one that deceives the whole
world was thrown down to earth

01:26:10.399 --> 01:26:11.732
with all of his angels."

01:26:11.734 --> 01:26:13.734
You wanted proof, remember?

01:26:13.736 --> 01:26:14.768
Here I am.

01:26:14.770 --> 01:26:16.470
God's own agent.

01:26:16.472 --> 01:26:19.706
Hold on.

01:26:19.708 --> 01:26:21.175
This can't be true.

01:26:21.177 --> 01:26:24.378
Oh, it can and it is.

01:26:47.368 --> 01:26:49.970
I did what you wanted.
We achieved our goal.

01:26:49.972 --> 01:26:52.339
You always knew
it had to end this way.

01:26:54.742 --> 01:26:58.445
Our Father, who art in heaven,

01:26:58.447 --> 01:27:00.380
hallowed be thy name.

01:27:00.382 --> 01:27:02.649
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done

01:27:02.651 --> 01:27:04.885
on earth as it is in heaven.

01:27:04.887 --> 01:27:07.454
Give us today our daily bread.

01:27:07.456 --> 01:27:08.956
What nerve.

01:27:08.958 --> 01:27:11.491
Praying to God now?

01:27:11.493 --> 01:27:13.760
What's your angle, I wonder?

01:27:13.762 --> 01:27:17.364
Go on, finish it.

01:27:17.366 --> 01:27:19.967
Lead us not into temptation,

01:27:19.969 --> 01:27:22.903
but deliver us from evil.

01:27:22.905 --> 01:27:24.471
Charles,

01:27:24.473 --> 01:27:26.340
what the fuck are you doing?

01:27:26.342 --> 01:27:28.976
One of you needs to take
the fall for the assassination

01:27:28.978 --> 01:27:32.646
and die for our mission
to be complete.

01:27:32.648 --> 01:27:34.815
There is no other way.

01:27:34.817 --> 01:27:36.383
This is the lamb of God

01:27:36.385 --> 01:27:39.486
who takes away
the sins of the world.

01:27:39.488 --> 01:27:42.623
Happy are those who are
called to his supper.

01:27:42.625 --> 01:27:43.957
Say it.

01:27:43.959 --> 01:27:46.293
Charles, you're fucking insane.

01:27:46.295 --> 01:27:47.661
Thursday, don't.

01:27:47.663 --> 01:27:49.830
- Step aside, kid.
- I am not...

01:27:49.832 --> 01:27:51.565
I am the devil.

01:27:51.567 --> 01:27:53.567
Stop it. Stop.

01:27:54.969 --> 01:27:57.938
You can't kill her, Charles.

01:27:57.940 --> 01:28:00.774
Take me.

01:28:00.776 --> 01:28:02.643
I'm ready.

01:28:03.778 --> 01:28:06.013
Lord...

01:28:06.015 --> 01:28:09.650
I am not worthy to receive you...

01:28:09.652 --> 01:28:12.019
but only say the word

01:28:12.021 --> 01:28:14.488
and I shall be healed.

01:28:19.028 --> 01:28:20.560
Amen.

01:28:20.562 --> 01:28:21.995
Rest in peace, my son.

01:28:24.833 --> 01:28:25.999
No!

01:28:53.494 --> 01:28:55.495
These pitiful creatures.

01:28:58.333 --> 01:29:00.334
A real saint.

01:29:00.336 --> 01:29:01.935
Who would have thought it?

01:29:01.937 --> 01:29:04.404
Wasn't expecting this, though.

01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:08.875
I mean, for you to grace us in the flesh.

01:29:08.877 --> 01:29:10.444
Can you believe it?

01:29:10.446 --> 01:29:12.846
I tell him to his face

01:29:12.848 --> 01:29:17.617
I am the devil.

01:29:17.619 --> 01:29:19.519
In one ear, out the other.

01:29:21.589 --> 01:29:23.824
We never had a draw before.

01:29:23.826 --> 01:29:25.892
What was the wager?

01:29:25.894 --> 01:29:29.429
Find a soul in desperation, a lost cause,

01:29:29.431 --> 01:29:31.498
and get him.

01:29:31.500 --> 01:29:34.101
One soul lost is humanity lost.

01:29:34.103 --> 01:29:37.838
One soul saved is humanity saved.

01:29:39.874 --> 01:29:41.875
I win.

01:29:41.877 --> 01:29:43.110
No.

01:29:44.679 --> 01:29:46.546
No, you don't.

01:29:46.548 --> 01:29:48.648
I had him.

01:29:48.650 --> 01:29:49.883
He loved me.

01:29:49.885 --> 01:29:52.619
He died for me!

01:29:52.621 --> 01:29:55.422
Thursday believed you were good.

01:29:55.424 --> 01:29:58.792
He loved you for all the lies you told him.

01:29:58.794 --> 01:30:03.730
And he died in the name
of innocence...

01:30:03.732 --> 01:30:07.467
saving you.

01:30:07.469 --> 01:30:10.971
The man reformed.

01:30:19.714 --> 01:30:21.481
He's with me.

01:30:21.483 --> 01:30:23.717
He's with me.

01:30:23.719 --> 01:30:24.985
He's with me.

01:30:28.724 --> 01:30:31.124
He's with me.

01:30:51.213 --> 01:30:54.214
<i>Life was a fly that faded,</i>

01:30:54.216 --> 01:30:56.683
<i>and death the drone that stung.</i>

01:30:56.685 --> 01:30:58.151
<i>The world was very old...
The world was very old</i>

01:30:58.153 --> 01:31:01.521
<i>indeed when you and I
were young.</i>

01:31:01.523 --> 01:31:03.590
<i>We have seen the city of Mansoul</i>

01:31:03.592 --> 01:31:06.726
<i>even as it rocked relieved...
Even as it rocked relieved.</i>

01:31:06.728 --> 01:31:09.696
<i>Blessed are they
who did not see,</i>

01:31:09.698 --> 01:31:13.800
<i>but being blind believed.</i>

01:32:21.068 --> 01:32:24.838
<i>For the hunter, the kill</i>

01:32:24.840 --> 01:32:28.775
<i>For the conqueror, the thrill</i>

01:32:28.777 --> 01:32:32.946
<i>For you</i>

01:32:32.948 --> 01:32:36.283
<i>For you, yeah</i>
