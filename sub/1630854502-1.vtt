WEBVTT

01:35.679 --> 01:39.223
[line ringing]

01:39.350 --> 01:41.767
Roy, hi, it's Jodi Shaw.

01:41.852 --> 01:44.061
You said to call you.

01:44.188 --> 01:46.063
Uh-huh.

01:46.190 --> 01:48.065
Oh, sure!

01:48.192 --> 01:52.319
I could head over to you
right now, if that works.

01:52.404 --> 01:53.487
Great.

02:12.174 --> 02:14.082
Yeah, I found her.

02:14.176 --> 02:15.584
Mm-hmm. Jodi Shaw.

02:15.678 --> 02:17.719
The one you're looking for.

02:27.690 --> 02:30.357
Hi, I'm Jodi Shaw,
here to see Roy.

02:30.442 --> 02:32.934
Hi, Jodi.
Let me get him for you.

02:33.028 --> 02:34.778
- [beep]
- Roy, Jodi's here.

02:36.532 --> 02:40.942
Wow, Roy,
that space is incredible.

02:41.036 --> 02:43.704
And I can really do
anything I want?

02:43.789 --> 02:46.081
Look, I don't like
to micromanage.

02:46.167 --> 02:49.626
I hired you because
you can do the job.

02:49.753 --> 02:52.838
Besides, uh, I looked at
your website,

02:52.923 --> 02:54.289
and it speaks for itself.

02:54.383 --> 02:56.425
And look, I know
this is a bigger project

02:56.510 --> 02:58.793
than what you're
used to, but...

02:58.888 --> 03:01.513
It's strange. I've been looking
to hire an assistant.

03:01.599 --> 03:03.965
This could be
the right time to do it.

03:04.059 --> 03:06.685
So what do you think
about it?

03:06.770 --> 03:09.137
Hmm...

03:09.231 --> 03:11.139
I think I'll take it.

03:11.233 --> 03:13.141
Thank you, Roy,
for this opportunity.

03:13.235 --> 03:15.977
Of course. And you can
show your appreciation

03:16.071 --> 03:17.988
by making my restaurant
the place to be.

03:18.115 --> 03:20.741
Well, I can definitely do that.

03:20.826 --> 03:21.909
Okay.

03:34.131 --> 03:35.505
Don't move.

03:36.717 --> 03:38.800
W-What do you--
What do you want?

03:38.886 --> 03:42.170
Let's start with your wallet,
and we'll move on from there.

03:42.264 --> 03:43.972
Okay, okay, okay.

03:44.058 --> 03:45.307
[woman screams]
Help!

03:46.310 --> 03:47.476
Screw this.

03:48.646 --> 03:52.981
- Oh, my God. Are you okay?
- [coughs]

03:53.067 --> 03:56.276
Yeah, I think so.
Um, I don't know.

03:59.740 --> 04:01.156
My...

04:01.242 --> 04:04.201
My heart feels like it's gonna
burst out of my chest.

04:04.328 --> 04:06.370
Okay, here, just look at me,
look at me.

04:06.497 --> 04:08.914
- Just focus, okay?
- [coughs]

04:08.999 --> 04:11.375
Take some deep breaths.
Nice and slow.

04:11.502 --> 04:12.918
In and out.

04:13.003 --> 04:16.213
- [exhales]
- That's it. Slow 'em down.

04:16.340 --> 04:18.131
There you go.

04:21.637 --> 04:23.044
I took a photo,

04:23.138 --> 04:25.213
but I don't think you can
make out who he is.

04:25.307 --> 04:27.882
Do you wanna call the cops?

04:27.977 --> 04:30.719
I-I didn't get
a good look either.

04:30.813 --> 04:33.888
I don't think--
He didn't take anything.

04:33.983 --> 04:36.858
The important thing is
that nothing bad happened.

04:36.944 --> 04:39.027
Thanks to you.

04:41.699 --> 04:44.399
Anyway, literally,
you saved my life.

04:44.493 --> 04:46.401
I don't even know your name.

04:46.495 --> 04:48.620
[chuckles]
It's Wendy.

04:48.706 --> 04:52.207
Thanks, Wendy. I'm Jodi.

04:52.293 --> 04:54.209
Pleased to meet you, Jodi.

04:54.295 --> 04:55.961
You're pleased?

04:58.215 --> 05:00.415
Well, I guess
I'll let you get going.

05:00.509 --> 05:02.926
I'm sure you're very busy.
Take care of yourself, Jodi.

05:03.053 --> 05:06.638
Wait. I can't let you
just walk away

05:06.724 --> 05:09.308
without doing
something for you.

05:09.393 --> 05:10.934
Can I at least
give you a reward?

05:11.061 --> 05:14.604
No, no, I wouldn't take that.

05:14.732 --> 05:18.025
Well, at least let me get you
a cup of coffee sometime.

05:18.110 --> 05:19.934
You don't have to do that,
Jodi.

05:20.029 --> 05:23.030
Please. On the "very least
I can do for you" scale,

05:23.115 --> 05:24.406
it's a solid ten.

05:24.491 --> 05:27.826
I wanna get to know
the girl who saved me.

05:27.911 --> 05:29.119
Sure, why not?

05:29.246 --> 05:31.538
Great. Take my number.

05:31.623 --> 05:34.541
- Okay.
- So it's Jodi Shaw...

05:36.587 --> 05:38.962
ERIC: Jo, you've had
one hell of a day.

05:39.089 --> 05:43.050
First, a big job offer,
then some creep almost mugs you?

05:43.135 --> 05:47.763
Yeah. I can still feel the knife
against my neck.

05:47.848 --> 05:51.141
I swear, for a minute,
I really thought that was it.

05:51.268 --> 05:53.968
I wish I was there
to help you, baby.

05:54.063 --> 05:56.188
Thank God
that girl Wendy was.

05:56.273 --> 05:59.808
I'm gonna take her for coffee
tomorrow, say thank you.

05:59.902 --> 06:02.027
Can we talk about
something else?

06:02.112 --> 06:03.445
No problem.

06:03.530 --> 06:07.816
So what's with the picnic
anyway?

06:07.910 --> 06:09.201
It's not our typical lunch.

06:09.286 --> 06:10.652
I need a special occasion

06:10.746 --> 06:13.413
to have a special meal
with my girl?

06:13.499 --> 06:16.583
I brought us
a bottle of champagne.

06:16.668 --> 06:18.126
Wait.

06:20.631 --> 06:21.797
Oh, my God.

06:21.882 --> 06:24.674
Wait, what is it?

06:24.802 --> 06:27.177
Oh, my God.

06:30.265 --> 06:34.142
Jodi Shaw, I love you.
Do you love me?

06:34.228 --> 06:35.560
I do.

06:35.646 --> 06:37.354
That leads me
to my next question--

06:37.481 --> 06:39.514
Yes, I'll marry you!

06:39.608 --> 06:41.182
[laughter]

06:41.276 --> 06:43.693
I love it. Thank you.

06:48.033 --> 06:49.032
Wow.

06:49.159 --> 06:51.493
Today really is
one for the books, huh?

06:51.578 --> 06:52.869
Yeah.

06:52.996 --> 06:55.872
Wait, so does this mean, um...

06:55.999 --> 06:59.459
we can finally move in together?

06:59.545 --> 07:02.546
You know how my parents feel
about that living-in-sin thing.

07:02.673 --> 07:05.841
I don't wanna upset 'em now.

07:09.513 --> 07:12.547
Hey, we will be married
soon enough,

07:12.641 --> 07:14.724
and all this isn't gonna
matter anymore.

07:14.852 --> 07:15.976
How soon?

07:18.397 --> 07:20.397
Soon.

07:20.524 --> 07:23.057
You know, sometimes I think
that you just wanna hold on

07:23.152 --> 07:25.226
to a teeny little bit
of your bachelorhood.

07:25.320 --> 07:28.488
Maybe just a sliver.

07:28.574 --> 07:30.157
But I'm all yours.

07:40.711 --> 07:44.629
Well, we're all smiles today.
Glad to see it.

07:44.715 --> 07:46.748
Anything new going on?

07:46.842 --> 07:48.800
I made contact with her.

07:48.886 --> 07:50.385
You did?

07:50.471 --> 07:51.753
I did.

07:51.847 --> 07:53.805
Well, that's great, Wendy!

07:53.891 --> 07:56.224
That's one of the things
we've been working towards.

07:56.310 --> 07:59.936
Now, um, I hope you're managing
your expectations.

08:00.063 --> 08:01.771
This isn't a typical situation.

08:01.899 --> 08:03.773
Don't worry, Dr. Farber.

08:03.901 --> 08:06.401
It couldn't have gone
any better.

08:06.487 --> 08:08.403
In fact, I'm feeling
so good these days,

08:08.489 --> 08:10.155
I don't think I need
to see you anymore.

08:10.240 --> 08:13.033
But I am so grateful
for all your help.

08:13.118 --> 08:17.287
Wendy, you can't just stop
your therapy on a whim.

08:17.414 --> 08:19.280
Now, sometimes we think
we're all better

08:19.374 --> 08:21.500
when it couldn't be
further from the truth.

08:21.585 --> 08:23.251
And sometimes we are.

08:23.337 --> 08:25.795
But thanks again, Dr. Farber.
I mean it.

08:25.923 --> 08:27.547
I couldn't have done it
without you.

08:29.885 --> 08:31.593
I may check in on you later.

08:37.809 --> 08:41.469
No way! All of this happened
in a single day?

08:41.563 --> 08:44.314
Yeah. Um, a job offer

08:44.441 --> 08:46.733
quickly followed by
a near stabbing,

08:46.818 --> 08:49.402
soon to be finished off
with an engagement.

08:49.488 --> 08:54.824
Okay, and just who is this girl
who saved you in a parking lot?

08:54.952 --> 08:57.285
Her name is Wendy Richards.

08:57.371 --> 08:59.988
I'm gonna take her for coffee
tomorrow to thank her properly.

09:00.082 --> 09:03.959
Hey, it's all just so nuts.

09:04.044 --> 09:06.002
I can't believe
you're getting married.

09:06.129 --> 09:08.496
I'm happy for you.

09:08.590 --> 09:10.507
So you guys didn't
set a date yet?

09:10.634 --> 09:12.834
We're gonna play it by ear.

09:12.928 --> 09:16.513
Hmm. You mean he bought the ring
to buy some time.

09:16.640 --> 09:18.557
Hey, I thought you liked Eric.

09:18.642 --> 09:21.851
I do. It's just,
you are aware

09:21.979 --> 09:24.512
that you're leaving me out here
all alone, right?

09:24.606 --> 09:26.106
Monica...

09:26.191 --> 09:27.682
What do you want me to say?

09:27.776 --> 09:29.851
My partner in crime
is going legit.

09:29.945 --> 09:33.780
I'm gonna be that sad,
friendless girl

09:33.865 --> 09:35.740
sitting by herself
at the end of the bar.

09:35.826 --> 09:38.159
Come on,
you have other friends.

09:38.245 --> 09:41.830
And we do other things
besides go to bars.

09:41.915 --> 09:43.206
Yeah.

09:46.295 --> 09:48.420
Folded arms, really?

09:48.505 --> 09:50.714
I don't know.
I'm being awful, aren't I?

09:50.841 --> 09:53.800
I am happy for you,
I swear.

09:53.885 --> 09:55.969
Of course, this means
we're gonna have to carve out

09:56.054 --> 09:58.471
some Jodi-Monica time
while we still can.

10:01.852 --> 10:04.352
What? What's wrong?

10:04.438 --> 10:05.887
Nothing.

10:05.981 --> 10:08.106
I'm just a little anxious
about this job I took on.

10:08.191 --> 10:10.058
It's just a restaurant.

10:10.152 --> 10:13.361
Find some classy tables,
splash some paint on the walls.

10:13.447 --> 10:15.947
You know, a few bar stools.
I don't see the big deal.

10:16.033 --> 10:17.616
It's more complicated
than that.

10:17.701 --> 10:19.784
Jodi, you're awesome
at what you do.

10:19.870 --> 10:21.286
You're gonna destroy it.

10:21.371 --> 10:25.540
Yeah, that's kinda
what I'm worried about.

10:28.670 --> 10:30.253
ERIC: Anyone home!

10:31.548 --> 10:34.215
Hey, what are you doing here?

10:34.301 --> 10:35.467
I had a meeting close by,

10:35.552 --> 10:38.419
so I thought
I'd surprise my fiancée

10:38.513 --> 10:40.088
with little floral affection.

10:40.182 --> 10:42.557
- How very Bachelor of you.
- I thought so.

10:42.643 --> 10:44.184
You're so sweet.

10:44.269 --> 10:45.935
So how's it going?

10:46.063 --> 10:47.595
Um, it's not, really.

10:47.689 --> 10:50.765
I'm trying to find anything
that inspires me,

10:50.859 --> 10:51.983
and so far nothing.

10:52.069 --> 10:53.943
Do you think
I'm in over my head?

10:54.071 --> 10:55.937
Maybe you're just
a little hungry.

10:56.031 --> 10:57.322
Mm, yeah.

10:57.407 --> 11:00.608
Actually, I haven't eaten today.
You want something?

11:00.702 --> 11:02.869
I could eat a little.

11:02.954 --> 11:04.445
Okay, well played.

11:04.539 --> 11:05.997
It's gonna have to be
quick, though.

11:06.083 --> 11:08.116
I'm meeting Wendy for coffee
in an hour.

11:08.210 --> 11:10.377
The good Samaritan.
I almost forgot.

11:10.462 --> 11:12.587
Mm-hmm.

11:12.673 --> 11:13.963
[phone buzzing]

11:14.091 --> 11:16.549
Hey, I gotta take this.
It's a work call.

11:19.262 --> 11:21.846
[whispering]
I told you not to call me.

11:21.932 --> 11:24.307
I was gonna call you.

11:24.434 --> 11:26.976
She's in the other room
right now.

11:29.439 --> 11:31.815
Yeah, yeah, we're still on
for tonight.

11:33.568 --> 11:35.985
I miss you too, baby.

11:42.619 --> 11:45.161
Mmm. Thanks again
for the coffee, Jodi.

11:45.288 --> 11:46.371
This place is great.

11:46.456 --> 11:48.990
Oh, please.
I still have no idea

11:49.084 --> 11:50.992
how I'm gonna thank you enough
for yesterday.

11:51.086 --> 11:53.545
It's cool.
It was just one of those

11:53.630 --> 11:55.672
right-place, right-time
things.

11:55.799 --> 11:59.259
Hey, isn't there
some old proverb

11:59.344 --> 12:01.335
about saving someone's life?

12:01.430 --> 12:03.138
Yeah, there sure is.

12:03.223 --> 12:05.181
It says that if you
save someone's life,

12:05.308 --> 12:07.308
you become responsible for it,

12:07.394 --> 12:11.563
like you have an obligation to
look after that person forever.

12:11.648 --> 12:14.015
I love those old sayings.

12:14.109 --> 12:17.518
So, uh,
are you from around here?

12:17.612 --> 12:18.853
No, I'm from Oregon,

12:18.947 --> 12:21.698
but I just got an apartment here
a few weeks ago.

12:21.825 --> 12:23.199
My mom died recently.

12:23.326 --> 12:25.193
Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that.

12:25.287 --> 12:27.996
Thanks. She was battling cancer
for a long time.

12:28.081 --> 12:30.415
I took care of her while I was
getting my bachelor's degree,

12:30.500 --> 12:33.877
but when she passed,
I just had to get out of there.

12:34.004 --> 12:35.962
New location, new perspective.

12:36.047 --> 12:37.630
[phone chimes]

12:43.513 --> 12:44.879
Is everything all right?

12:44.973 --> 12:47.098
Oh, yeah, everything's fine.

12:47.184 --> 12:48.883
Was that your fiancé?

12:48.977 --> 12:51.895
No, no, that was the new client,
actually.

12:52.022 --> 12:54.055
How did you know
I had a fiancé?

12:54.149 --> 12:56.191
It's written
all over your finger.

12:56.276 --> 12:57.892
Oh!

12:57.986 --> 13:01.321
Sorry. It's, uh,
it's still very new.

13:03.200 --> 13:06.117
So, new client.
What do you do?

13:06.203 --> 13:08.236
I have a small
interior design business.

13:08.330 --> 13:09.788
Oh, that's so funny.

13:09.873 --> 13:12.907
My mother worked in interior
design before she got sick.

13:13.001 --> 13:15.084
So what kind of projects
do you work on?

13:15.212 --> 13:17.003
Mostly smaller spaces.

13:17.088 --> 13:19.247
I just got my first
restaurant, though.

13:19.341 --> 13:21.916
Congratulations.
That sounds like a lot of fun.

13:22.010 --> 13:26.721
Mm-hmm, it is.
It's definitely a lot.

13:26.807 --> 13:28.422
So how about you?

13:28.517 --> 13:32.101
Well, I just moved here,
so I'm still looking for a job,

13:32.229 --> 13:33.645
but I need to
start looking harder.

13:33.730 --> 13:35.814
The next few months
are gonna get pretty tight.

13:35.899 --> 13:39.067
My last real job was assisting
my mom with interior design.

13:39.152 --> 13:40.777
Oh, yeah? Did you like it?

13:40.904 --> 13:43.154
It was a lot of
administrative work,

13:43.240 --> 13:46.107
but yeah, I really did.

13:46.201 --> 13:50.245
Now I know how I'm gonna
return the favor.

13:50.330 --> 13:51.779
Come work for me.

13:51.873 --> 13:54.115
What are you talking about?

13:54.209 --> 13:56.459
This restaurant is the biggest
client I've ever had.

13:56.586 --> 13:58.753
I was looking to hire
an assistant.

13:58.839 --> 14:01.289
You have experience, so...

14:01.383 --> 14:03.124
But you don't even know me.

14:03.218 --> 14:07.345
Uh, Wendy, you saved my life.
What else do I need to know?

14:07.430 --> 14:09.889
I'll need a reference,
of course,

14:09.975 --> 14:13.017
but if you're interested,
it's all yours.

14:13.103 --> 14:16.396
I'll take it. Thank you!
I can't wait to get started!

14:16.481 --> 14:17.605
Me too!

14:18.650 --> 14:20.191
Cheers.

14:29.411 --> 14:30.410
[gasps]

14:30.495 --> 14:32.036
Don't sneak up on me
like that.

14:32.122 --> 14:34.956
That's what you
hired me for, right?

14:35.041 --> 14:36.332
[laughs]

14:36.459 --> 14:38.626
So how was I?
Scary enough for you?

14:38.712 --> 14:41.713
First, take off the hood
and the sunglasses.

14:41.798 --> 14:44.165
We need to be careful.

14:44.259 --> 14:46.551
And, yes, it worked.

14:46.636 --> 14:49.345
That's right,
like a damn charm, it did.

14:49.472 --> 14:51.672
That girl was
shaking like a leaf,

14:51.766 --> 14:54.392
even though she was in
no real danger,

14:54.477 --> 14:55.810
except maybe from you.

14:55.896 --> 14:57.687
There's an extra thousand
in there.

14:57.814 --> 15:00.273
Oh, yeah? What for?

15:00.358 --> 15:03.517
Because there's one more thing
I'm gonna have you do for me.

15:03.612 --> 15:05.403
Yeah? What's that?

15:08.742 --> 15:10.867
[phone ringing]

15:10.994 --> 15:13.036
Dr. Farber,
why are you calling me?

15:13.163 --> 15:14.621
Didn't I tell you I would?

15:14.706 --> 15:16.706
And didn't I tell you
I'm all better now?

15:16.833 --> 15:18.532
Yes, you're feeling better,
sure,

15:18.627 --> 15:21.202
but that doesn't necessarily
mean that you are.

15:21.296 --> 15:23.537
Well, I just had coffee
with her,

15:23.632 --> 15:25.965
and it was wonderful.

15:26.051 --> 15:30.211
I get it that you're finally
getting some closure here,

15:30.305 --> 15:32.680
and I'm very happy for you,

15:32.766 --> 15:35.216
but we still have
some work to do,

15:35.310 --> 15:36.851
even if it's just
over the phone.

15:36.937 --> 15:37.852
[phone chimes]

15:37.938 --> 15:40.021
I care about you, Wendy.

15:41.733 --> 15:44.984
Look, you're a very nice woman,
Dr. Farber,

15:45.070 --> 15:49.230
but like I keep telling you,
I'm cured.

15:49.324 --> 15:51.449
ERIC: Looks like she got
her groove back.

15:51.534 --> 15:53.701
Starting to.

15:53.787 --> 15:55.453
Really is
a ton of work, though.

15:55.538 --> 15:57.571
Didn't you say you're gonna hire
an assistant or something?

15:57.666 --> 16:01.334
I just did, actually.
I hired Wendy.

16:01.419 --> 16:05.630
- What? Are you serious?
- Yeah, of course I am. Why not?

16:05.715 --> 16:08.800
You were just sitting down
for coffee with her yesterday.

16:08.885 --> 16:10.343
What's her name again?

16:10.428 --> 16:11.678
Wendy Richards.

16:11.763 --> 16:13.587
And you just offered her a job
like that.

16:13.682 --> 16:16.424
Did you think about having her
in your house every single day?

16:16.518 --> 16:19.477
I know, I hear you.
She's basically a stranger.

16:19.562 --> 16:21.646
Jo, she's not basically
a stranger.

16:21.731 --> 16:23.231
She is a stranger.

16:23.316 --> 16:25.933
Relax. I was just about
to check on her reference.

16:26.027 --> 16:28.528
And if it doesn't work out,
it doesn't work out.

16:28.613 --> 16:31.698
Look, I offered her
the job, okay?

16:31.783 --> 16:34.942
It wasn't like
she asked me for it.

16:35.036 --> 16:37.328
No good deed goes unpunished.

16:37.414 --> 16:40.164
Did you even check
if she could do the job?

16:40.250 --> 16:42.125
Yeah, I'm pretty sure she can.

16:42.252 --> 16:44.502
Either way, I'm willing
to roll the dice.

16:44.587 --> 16:48.006
Don't worry, baby.
I have a good feeling about her.

16:48.091 --> 16:51.926
If you say so.
Dinner's in the kitchen.

16:53.638 --> 16:57.056
[line ringing]

16:59.227 --> 17:01.853
Hi, my name is Jodi.
I was given this number

17:01.938 --> 17:05.806
to check on a reference for
someone I'm looking to employ.

17:05.900 --> 17:07.984
Uh-huh.

17:08.111 --> 17:10.403
Yes, her name is
Wendy Richards.

17:10.488 --> 17:11.988
She worked at
your interior design company.

17:12.115 --> 17:13.573
I believe her mother did too.

17:13.658 --> 17:15.992
Is there anything that you can tell me about her?

17:16.119 --> 17:18.161
Yeah, she was
an excellent employee.

17:18.288 --> 17:20.163
Honestly, one of the best
I ever had.

17:20.290 --> 17:23.332
That young woman could spot
a problem from a mile away.

17:23.460 --> 17:25.585
Really sorry to see her go.

17:25.670 --> 17:29.663
Well, thank you. That is exactly
what I wanted to hear.

17:29.758 --> 17:31.841
Okay, thanks. Yeah, bye.

17:31.968 --> 17:33.176
Take care.

18:02.082 --> 18:04.248
JODI: Well, this is it.

18:06.336 --> 18:07.752
Wow.

18:07.837 --> 18:11.705
I love your office, Jodi.

18:11.800 --> 18:14.425
I totally get
why you do what you do.

18:16.012 --> 18:18.054
So this is the young lady
who saved my girl.

18:18.181 --> 18:20.381
Uh-huh, this is her.

18:20.475 --> 18:21.382
I'm Eric.

18:21.476 --> 18:23.893
Wendy. Nice to meet you, Eric.

18:24.020 --> 18:25.853
My pleasure.

18:25.939 --> 18:28.272
All right, I gotta head back
to the office

18:28.358 --> 18:30.558
before this whole town's
legal system falls to pieces.

18:30.652 --> 18:32.860
- Okay, well, call me later.
- Okay.

18:38.576 --> 18:41.452
- He's, uh, quite a charmer.
- He sure is.

18:41.538 --> 18:44.789
And he doesn't mind having
somebody new in his home?

18:44.874 --> 18:46.791
Oh, no,
Eric doesn't live here.

18:46.876 --> 18:49.243
Oh. I just assumed he did.

18:49.337 --> 18:51.379
Well, I'd be into living
together before we get married,

18:51.464 --> 18:54.382
but he wants to wait until we
make the whole thing official.

18:54.467 --> 18:58.419
So you're never afraid,
living here alone?

18:58.513 --> 19:02.223
Not really.
It's a good neighborhood.

19:02.308 --> 19:04.758
And he really is here
a lot of the time,

19:04.853 --> 19:07.428
as you can tell
from all his random crap

19:07.522 --> 19:09.188
that he leaves lying around,

19:09.274 --> 19:13.317
and all his legal stuff,
and his freaking golf clubs.

19:14.571 --> 19:16.112
So much clutter.

19:16.239 --> 19:17.938
What's that?

19:18.032 --> 19:19.440
Oh, nothing.

19:19.534 --> 19:23.244
So, um, shall we get started?

19:23.329 --> 19:24.620
Yeah.

19:24.747 --> 19:26.873
Hey, you do know

19:26.958 --> 19:29.500
we're gonna nail this project
up and down, right?

19:29.586 --> 19:32.453
You sound extremely confident
when you say that.

19:32.547 --> 19:35.256
And you should be too.
Come on, say it with me.

19:35.341 --> 19:39.293
We're gonna nail this project
up and down!

19:39.387 --> 19:40.970
Damn right, we are.

19:41.097 --> 19:43.806
- Come on.
- Great.

19:43.933 --> 19:47.018
Let me show you where
I'm starting with today.

19:48.062 --> 19:49.803
- [knocking]
- MONICA: Hello.

19:49.898 --> 19:53.474
Jodi, are you here?

19:53.568 --> 19:56.444
WENDY: You know what might be
a good idea?

19:56.529 --> 19:58.979
What if we went out and
found a local artist or two

19:59.073 --> 20:01.449
- and displayed their work.
- Who is that?

20:01.534 --> 20:04.652
JODI: That would show pride
in our town,

20:04.746 --> 20:06.746
develop a real sense of
community in the place.

20:06.831 --> 20:08.831
WENDY: And you can't buy
that kind of thing can you?

20:08.958 --> 20:11.000
- JODI: That's an awesome idea.
- Hi.

20:11.127 --> 20:14.462
Hey, Monica!
I didn't hear you come in.

20:14.547 --> 20:16.214
And who's this?

20:16.299 --> 20:17.298
I'm Wendy.

20:17.383 --> 20:18.841
Oh, you're the lifesaver.

20:18.968 --> 20:20.760
Thanks for helping out
my best friend.

20:20.845 --> 20:23.837
She's also my new assistant
on the restaurant project.

20:23.932 --> 20:26.057
Really?

20:26.142 --> 20:28.142
Um, well, congratulations.

20:28.228 --> 20:31.020
So maybe she can
hold down the fort

20:31.147 --> 20:32.980
while we go grab
a quick lunch?

20:33.066 --> 20:35.441
She's welcome to join,
of course.

20:35.526 --> 20:36.651
What do you think?

20:36.736 --> 20:38.569
That does sound like fun,

20:38.655 --> 20:40.363
but we're kind of
on a roll here.

20:40.490 --> 20:43.023
Might be hard to get the energy
back up after a big meal.

20:43.117 --> 20:44.367
Yeah, you know, she's right.

20:44.494 --> 20:46.702
I'm sorry, Monica.
Another time okay?

20:46.829 --> 20:48.704
Um, yeah, that's fine.

20:48.831 --> 20:51.207
I guess I'll get out
of your way then.

20:51.334 --> 20:52.700
I'll walk you out.

20:52.794 --> 20:54.627
It was great meeting you,
Monica.

20:54.712 --> 20:56.254
Same.

21:01.844 --> 21:06.931
Isn't it a little fast
to hire somebody you just met?

21:07.016 --> 21:10.059
Maybe, but, you know,
she needed a job,

21:10.186 --> 21:13.062
and if it wasn't for her,
I might not be here now at all.

21:13.189 --> 21:15.690
All right, fair enough.

21:15.775 --> 21:17.275
Well, we simply have
to celebrate

21:17.360 --> 21:20.444
you not getting stabbed
by a crazy mugger.

21:20.530 --> 21:22.029
Happy hour, Thursday?

21:22.115 --> 21:23.990
I really should be
buckling down.

21:24.075 --> 21:27.243
But I guess a little night out
won't hurt.

21:27.370 --> 21:28.494
Just a drink or two.

21:28.579 --> 21:30.746
It'll be a riot, I promise.

21:30.873 --> 21:33.040
- Call you in the morning?
- Sure.

21:55.273 --> 21:56.430
- Do you think?
- Yeah.

21:56.524 --> 21:58.816
- Okay.
- [phone ringing]

22:00.028 --> 22:01.485
One sec.

22:02.405 --> 22:04.030
Eric, hey, what's up?

22:04.115 --> 22:06.782
Just finished a few briefs.
About to grab a late lunch.

22:06.909 --> 22:08.609
Anyway, I wanted to check in,

22:08.703 --> 22:10.369
see how it's going
with Supergirl.

22:10.455 --> 22:12.163
Oh, really? Super, actually.

22:12.248 --> 22:14.114
She's been a great help
so far.

22:14.208 --> 22:15.249
Great.

22:15.335 --> 22:16.459
Glad to hear.

22:16.586 --> 22:18.127
Anyway, I'll let you two
go back to work.

22:18.254 --> 22:20.629
All right. Thank you, baby.
Have a good lunch.

22:20.757 --> 22:23.049
I will. I love you.

22:23.134 --> 22:24.800
I love you too.

22:38.191 --> 22:40.358
But I don't understand
what you're saying.

22:40.443 --> 22:42.193
We had a deal.

22:42.278 --> 22:47.573
Yes! Oh, well, no,
but that's not fair!

22:47.658 --> 22:50.659
Oh, right, like I can just
afford to take you to court.

22:50.787 --> 22:53.654
That's all you have
to say about it?

22:53.748 --> 22:56.332
You know what?
Thanks for nothing.

22:59.170 --> 23:01.328
Wendy?

23:01.422 --> 23:03.172
I'm sorry.
That was a personal call.

23:03.299 --> 23:04.665
It won't happen again.

23:04.759 --> 23:08.135
Hey, if I can take
personal calls, so can you.

23:08.221 --> 23:11.222
Everything okay?

23:11.307 --> 23:12.473
Yeah.
[clears throat]

23:12.558 --> 23:14.007
It's all good.

23:14.102 --> 23:16.811
That didn't sound any good,
much less all good.

23:16.896 --> 23:18.729
What's going on?

23:18.815 --> 23:20.347
You know how some days

23:20.441 --> 23:24.485
life just decides to throw
a brand-new lesson your way?

23:24.570 --> 23:27.780
Well, today I learned
to never do a handshake deal

23:27.865 --> 23:30.190
on an apartment.

23:30.284 --> 23:31.617
Ouch.

23:31.702 --> 23:34.370
- [sighs]
- Ohh...

23:34.497 --> 23:37.039
I'm sorry.

23:37.166 --> 23:39.032
It's fine, it's fine.

23:39.127 --> 23:42.536
I'll figure something out.

23:42.630 --> 23:44.672
Like what?

23:46.467 --> 23:50.377
When I think of it, you will be
the very first to know.

23:50.471 --> 23:54.098
I guess a motel
in the short term.

23:54.183 --> 23:56.475
A motel?

23:56.561 --> 23:58.644
I'll be all right.

24:00.314 --> 24:02.189
Okay, we can do better
than that.

24:02.275 --> 24:03.774
I have a guest bedroom.

24:03.860 --> 24:06.485
Why don't you just stay here
until you find a new place?

24:06.571 --> 24:07.895
I-I couldn't.

24:07.989 --> 24:11.073
You could, actually.

24:11.200 --> 24:12.950
Do it for me, all right?

24:13.035 --> 24:15.161
I cannot risk
losing any great ideas

24:15.246 --> 24:17.288
because my assistant
is too busy stressing out

24:17.373 --> 24:20.207
about where she's gonna sleep.

24:20.293 --> 24:23.410
Thank you, Jodi.
First the job and now this?

24:23.504 --> 24:25.746
Oh, God. Look, I know
I keep saying it,

24:25.840 --> 24:29.216
but it really is
the least I can do.

24:31.304 --> 24:35.723
Okay, what about your stuff?
Couch, bed?

24:35.808 --> 24:40.311
The apartment came furnished.
I'm traveling light these days.

24:40.396 --> 24:43.481
They do want me out
by Friday, though.

24:43.566 --> 24:47.935
Screw 'em. Go get your stuff
and bring it back here now.

24:48.029 --> 24:50.070
Jodi, you're the best!

24:51.908 --> 24:53.365
[bell rings]

24:55.912 --> 24:59.288
Hey, Wendy, were you able to get
quotes for the floor tiling?

24:59.415 --> 25:02.783
I sure did. I sent you an email
on it about a half-hour ago.

25:02.877 --> 25:04.668
Thank you, Wendy.
I mean it.

25:04.754 --> 25:06.587
I cannot believe how much
you managed to get done

25:06.672 --> 25:07.755
on the first day.

25:07.840 --> 25:09.340
We make
a pretty good team, huh?

25:09.425 --> 25:11.091
You want a glass of wine
to celebrate?

25:11.177 --> 25:14.294
Oh, I'm good. Alcohol
makes me tired the next day.

25:14.388 --> 25:16.555
It can have that effect.

25:16.641 --> 25:18.224
[phone chimes]

25:18.309 --> 25:23.303
So thanks again for letting me
stay here for a while.

25:23.397 --> 25:25.639
I know Eric doesn't
live here yet,

25:25.733 --> 25:27.191
but are you sure
he's gonna be cool with it?

25:27.276 --> 25:29.568
Oh, my God,
he's gonna be fine.

25:29.654 --> 25:31.144
ERIC: Jodi! Where are you?

25:31.239 --> 25:32.905
Oh, hey, babe! Were in here!

25:34.283 --> 25:36.116
[softly]
Ah, she's still here.

25:36.202 --> 25:37.409
How's it going, ladies?

25:37.495 --> 25:40.579
Hey, baby, we were just
talking about you.

25:40.665 --> 25:43.332
You two finishing up
some work?

25:43.459 --> 25:44.667
No, no, we finished up.

25:44.794 --> 25:46.994
Oh. What are you
still doing here?

25:47.088 --> 25:48.420
Well, Jodi said that I--

25:48.506 --> 25:51.331
Wendy's gonna crash here
for a little while.

25:51.425 --> 25:52.466
Say what?

25:52.552 --> 25:55.719
Just until she finds
a new place.

25:55.805 --> 25:58.505
Well, what happened
to your apartment?

25:58.599 --> 26:00.099
My landlord kicked me out.

26:00.184 --> 26:02.393
[scoffs]
Just like that.

26:02.478 --> 26:04.177
Yep, just like that.

26:04.272 --> 26:07.273
The jerk pulled the rug right up
from underneath my feet.

26:07.358 --> 26:09.567
Well, you do know
you have rights as a tenant.

26:09.652 --> 26:11.018
Yeah, I know,

26:11.112 --> 26:13.904
but I didn't officially
sign a lease or anything.

26:13.990 --> 26:15.689
You didn't sign a lease. Why?

26:15.783 --> 26:17.691
Well, I was going to,

26:17.785 --> 26:20.244
but it was kind of
a subletting thing.

26:20.329 --> 26:22.362
It's a little hard
to explain.

26:22.456 --> 26:23.864
You have squatters' rights--

26:23.958 --> 26:28.752
Baby, we talk in the kitchen
real fast, hmm?

26:30.590 --> 26:33.048
Be right back.

26:40.141 --> 26:42.433
- I know what you're gonna say.
- And I'm alone here?

26:42.518 --> 26:44.885
You didn't even know this girl
a few days ago.

26:44.979 --> 26:46.553
Now she went from
your office assistant

26:46.647 --> 26:48.221
to living in your house
with you?

26:48.316 --> 26:50.057
You mean a few days ago
when she stopped me

26:50.151 --> 26:51.558
from possibly getting
stabbed to death,

26:51.652 --> 26:54.528
and today I'm simply trying
to pay it back?

26:54.614 --> 26:57.531
I'm not downplaying
what she did for you,

26:57.617 --> 26:59.158
but you don't think
it's a little strange

26:59.243 --> 27:00.909
she's entrenched in your life
like this now?

27:01.037 --> 27:04.872
Look, I overheard her on
the phone losing her apartment,

27:04.957 --> 27:06.740
so I offered her
the guest bedroom.

27:06.834 --> 27:10.586
Again, she hasn't asked me
for a single thing since we met.

27:10.713 --> 27:13.631
Her bags are now
in your guest room.

27:13.716 --> 27:16.925
What do you want me to do?
You want me to ask her to leave?

27:17.053 --> 27:19.252
It's not like something like
she's in your way.

27:19.347 --> 27:21.889
It's not like you live here.

27:23.684 --> 27:25.392
How did this become about us?

27:25.478 --> 27:27.561
Well, it's true, isn't it?

27:28.689 --> 27:30.931
- Hey, um, I should go.
- Wendy...

27:31.025 --> 27:34.610
Let me just grab my things,
and I'll get out of your hair.

27:38.199 --> 27:39.239
Nice.

27:39.325 --> 27:41.617
Wendy! Wendy!

27:43.037 --> 27:44.495
Wendy.

27:44.580 --> 27:45.996
Wendy, stop.

27:46.082 --> 27:48.791
It's all right, Jodi.
The last thing I want to do

27:48.918 --> 27:51.960
is be the cause of any trouble
between you guys.

27:52.088 --> 27:54.963
The cause of my trouble?
Are you serious?

27:55.091 --> 27:57.383
I need you.

27:58.678 --> 28:01.136
Hey, thanks for saving me there
with Eric.

28:01.263 --> 28:03.130
Do you think he's gonna
flip out over this?

28:03.224 --> 28:06.058
Don't worry about him, okay?
He's just being protective.

28:06.143 --> 28:09.061
But this is my house,
my company,

28:09.146 --> 28:13.107
and I make the rules here,
so... you'll stay?

28:13.192 --> 28:15.192
Of course I will.

28:15.277 --> 28:17.444
Okay, great.

28:22.576 --> 28:24.910
[chuckles]

28:49.353 --> 28:50.936
[laughs]

28:53.441 --> 28:56.108
I can't believe
I actually did it.

29:04.326 --> 29:08.695
I never imagined
I'd actually be here...

29:08.789 --> 29:11.999
with her in her house.

29:12.960 --> 29:14.918
Look at me now.

29:27.141 --> 29:28.215
Come in.

29:28.309 --> 29:31.018
Hey, how's it going in here?

29:31.103 --> 29:32.269
Is the room okay?

29:32.354 --> 29:35.230
It's perfect, Jodi.
Thank you.

29:35.357 --> 29:36.607
Is Eric still around?

29:36.692 --> 29:39.943
No, no, he just left.
And don't worry.

29:40.029 --> 29:41.945
We're all on the same page here
for the most part.

29:42.031 --> 29:44.198
Well, we're certainly
getting there.

29:45.493 --> 29:49.569
Well, bedtime for me.
I'm exhausted.

29:49.663 --> 29:52.831
Oh, right.
I almost forgot to tell you.

29:52.917 --> 29:56.001
Um, I got an email from Roy,
the restaurant client.

29:56.086 --> 29:58.086
He wants to meet us both
in his office this week.

29:58.214 --> 30:00.005
Sounds good, Boss.

30:00.090 --> 30:03.217
Okay. Well, if you don't
need anything else,

30:03.302 --> 30:04.468
I'm gonna say good night.

30:04.553 --> 30:06.220
I have everything I need.

30:06.305 --> 30:07.679
Okay.

30:16.106 --> 30:17.815
Finally.

31:08.909 --> 31:12.452
Tsk, tsk, tsk, Jodi.

31:12.538 --> 31:15.330
There's nothing healthy
to eat in here.

31:15.457 --> 31:18.208
I have to do
some shopping for you.

31:55.080 --> 31:57.080
JODI: And the next one.

31:59.084 --> 32:01.043
Nice.

32:01.170 --> 32:02.711
Very nice.

32:02.838 --> 32:04.421
Any notes?

32:04.506 --> 32:07.090
Uh, you know,

32:07.176 --> 32:09.876
I'm not crazy about the blinds
for the main room.

32:09.970 --> 32:11.178
I'll keep looking.

32:12.848 --> 32:17.059
This is really good work, Jodi.
I'm impressed.

32:17.186 --> 32:19.019
Well, thank God. I, uh...

32:19.104 --> 32:21.188
I've been a little worried
you might be disappointed.

32:21.273 --> 32:22.731
Well, I wasn't worried.

32:22.858 --> 32:24.316
Can you believe
with all of her skills,

32:24.401 --> 32:26.109
she has the nerve
to doubt herself?

32:26.195 --> 32:28.403
I mean, this woman
can do anything.

32:28.530 --> 32:30.897
Couldn't agree with you more.

32:30.991 --> 32:32.732
Okay, you two are gonna
make me blush.

32:32.826 --> 32:34.076
I will say, though,

32:34.203 --> 32:36.236
that Wendy has been
incredibly helpful so far.

32:36.330 --> 32:41.166
Here is some work
from a couple of local artists

32:41.251 --> 32:43.710
that should turn a few heads
in our little eatery.

32:43.796 --> 32:45.712
All Wendy's idea.

32:45.798 --> 32:47.714
Oh, wow. These are great.

32:47.800 --> 32:51.093
We really make
a great team, huh?

32:51.220 --> 32:53.261
Well, based on
how you two met,

32:53.389 --> 32:55.347
I'm gonna have to agree
with you there as well.

32:55.432 --> 32:57.015
No doubt we'll still
be telling you

32:57.101 --> 33:00.644
we're just a couple old ladies
in the nursing home.

33:03.399 --> 33:08.268
So, Wendy, um, what are
your plans beyond this project?

33:08.362 --> 33:10.437
Um, I'm not really sure.

33:10.531 --> 33:13.615
I'd love to continue working
in interior design with Jodi,

33:13.742 --> 33:16.994
but I probably need a college
degree to be taken seriously.

33:17.079 --> 33:20.280
Oh, wait, I thought you told me
you had a bachelor's degree.

33:20.374 --> 33:24.501
Yes, I did say that,
and I do,

33:24.586 --> 33:27.337
but I just mean one that's
more closely connected

33:27.423 --> 33:28.839
to this type of work.

33:28.924 --> 33:30.382
Ah, yeah, makes sense.

33:30.467 --> 33:32.125
Mm-hmm.

33:32.219 --> 33:35.637
Uh, so is there anything else?

33:35.764 --> 33:39.391
Uh, no, I think we're good.

33:40.728 --> 33:42.477
So, uh...

33:42.604 --> 33:46.023
any plans for dinner tonight?

33:46.108 --> 33:47.983
Spending time with your man,
I assume.

33:48.110 --> 33:50.819
Actually, I'm having drinks
with my best friend Monica.

33:50.946 --> 33:54.948
Nice, nice. Well,
I hope you have a great time,

33:55.034 --> 33:56.575
and I'll be in touch soon.

33:56.660 --> 33:57.993
Great.

33:59.246 --> 34:01.580
- Thank you, Roy.
- Of course.

34:03.417 --> 34:05.417
Thank you, Roy.

34:14.261 --> 34:16.553
[phone ringing]

34:18.348 --> 34:21.725
Dr. Farber, I'm starting to feel
like you're stalking me.

34:21.810 --> 34:23.676
That's hardly the case.

34:23.771 --> 34:25.353
Did you get my text
about calling me?

34:25.481 --> 34:29.849
Yes, I got it, but I don't think
you're getting it.

34:29.943 --> 34:31.359
Reconnecting with my past

34:31.487 --> 34:33.820
is the most important thing
I have ever done.

34:33.906 --> 34:36.573
But if you're not
mentally prepared for it,

34:36.658 --> 34:39.859
you could undo a lot of
what we've been working on.

34:39.953 --> 34:43.371
Look, I appreciate your concern,

34:43.499 --> 34:45.749
but I'm actually
very busy right now.

34:45.834 --> 34:49.252
Can I just give you a call back
when things settle down a bit?

34:49.338 --> 34:50.921
Please do that.

34:51.006 --> 34:53.840
And before you go,
I'm curious.

34:53.926 --> 34:56.885
What did the woman say
when you told her everything?

34:57.012 --> 34:59.679
- Well...
- Wendy...

34:59.765 --> 35:02.724
you did tell her
everything, right?

35:03.977 --> 35:07.312
Look, Doctor, I gotta go.
Next time.

35:07.397 --> 35:09.064
Everything okay?

35:09.191 --> 35:12.651
Why does everyone keep
asking me that? I'm perfect.

35:12.736 --> 35:14.060
Glad to hear it.

35:14.154 --> 35:15.570
Just wanna let you know
I'm gonna go get ready.

35:15.697 --> 35:18.281
- For what?
- Drinks with Monica.

35:18.367 --> 35:22.119
I really need to get a move on.
I'll see you inside.

35:40.389 --> 35:42.097
Yep.

35:46.562 --> 35:51.022
Jodi, the party has arrived.

35:51.108 --> 35:52.649
Are you here?

35:54.194 --> 35:56.936
Oh! You scared me.

35:57.030 --> 35:59.739
Sorry. I forgot
the party was coming

35:59.825 --> 36:02.409
Yeah, that's me.

36:02.494 --> 36:05.612
Hey, Jodi are you almost ready?
We're meeting Kate.

36:05.706 --> 36:07.330
JODI: Be right there!

36:08.917 --> 36:12.085
So, uh, aren't you two done
working for the day?

36:12.171 --> 36:14.671
Yeah, we finished up
a while ago.

36:14.756 --> 36:17.090
Then what are you
still doing here?

36:17.176 --> 36:21.127
Just watching some TV.
I might stream a movie later.

36:21.221 --> 36:22.929
I haven't decided yet.

36:23.015 --> 36:25.599
Why would you do that here?
Don't you have a home?

36:25.684 --> 36:28.468
Oh, Jodi didn't tell you?

36:28.562 --> 36:30.896
This is my home now.

36:32.482 --> 36:33.815
Ready.

36:33.942 --> 36:35.475
This one's raring to go.

36:35.569 --> 36:36.902
What time will you be back?

36:36.987 --> 36:39.196
Uh, not too late.

36:39.281 --> 36:43.491
Okay, because we really have
a lot of work to do tomorrow.

36:43.619 --> 36:46.870
Okay. We're gonna miss
happy hour. Let's go.

36:46.955 --> 36:50.373
- She's living with you now?
- I will tell you at the bar.

36:58.133 --> 37:00.634
♪♪ [casual]

37:00.719 --> 37:03.503
So Monica told me about

37:03.597 --> 37:06.673
that girl who saved you
from some stabby-looking dude.

37:06.767 --> 37:08.016
That is so crazy.

37:08.143 --> 37:10.477
It was pretty crazy.
I'm not gonna lie.

37:10.562 --> 37:13.846
Did your life like flash
before your eyes or anything?

37:13.941 --> 37:16.775
No, I don't think so.

37:16.860 --> 37:19.069
You know,
it all happened so fast.

37:19.154 --> 37:21.780
Hey, how about another round?

37:23.617 --> 37:25.742
Well, for me,
I have a 7 a.m. spin class.

37:25.827 --> 37:28.036
- Oh, bummer.
- We'll do it again soon.

37:28.163 --> 37:29.663
Get home safe.

37:33.502 --> 37:35.669
Well, looks like
it's just us.

37:35.754 --> 37:39.673
And I'm having a blast, Mon,
but I think I'm done too.

37:39.758 --> 37:41.341
Oh, come on.
Before you know it,

37:41.426 --> 37:42.926
you'll be watching
Housewives repeats,

37:43.011 --> 37:44.427
sitting next to Eric,

37:44.513 --> 37:47.305
wishing you were here
laughing with me.

37:47.391 --> 37:50.350
Please. Eric hates
those Housewives shows.

37:50.435 --> 37:54.187
And maybe by then,
a housewife I shall be.

37:54.273 --> 37:57.148
Well, then cheers to that.

38:00.654 --> 38:02.445
But it's time to call
a car service.

38:02.531 --> 38:04.322
Okay, okay, I'll do it.

38:04.408 --> 38:06.283
Okay.

38:07.661 --> 38:09.786
Siri, call me a car service.

38:09.871 --> 38:12.572
SIRI: Okay.
You're a car service.

38:12.666 --> 38:14.073
[laughing]

38:14.167 --> 38:16.668
Oh, come on!
I'm the one that's gotta get up

38:16.753 --> 38:18.745
and go out of town tomorrow
to see my folks.

38:18.839 --> 38:21.914
What's the matter,
you gotta get home to Wendy?

38:22.009 --> 38:24.634
JODI: Are you jealous?
MONICA: I am not.

38:24.720 --> 38:27.762
It's just the whole situation
is weird.

38:27.889 --> 38:30.256
She's working for me.
Why is that weird?

38:30.350 --> 38:31.683
And lives with you

38:31.768 --> 38:33.143
and checks out
when you'll be coming home

38:33.228 --> 38:34.936
like some
annoying little sister.

38:35.063 --> 38:36.604
JODI: You're making
too much of this.

38:36.732 --> 38:38.773
And you don't know anything
about her.

38:38.900 --> 38:41.651
I checked with
her last boss, okay?

38:41.737 --> 38:44.771
He gave me his full
stamp of approval.

38:44.865 --> 38:47.991
I appreciate your concern,
but after what she did--

38:48.076 --> 38:50.943
I get it, I get it. She was
there when you needed help.

38:51.038 --> 38:52.954
If I was there,

38:53.081 --> 38:55.915
not only would I have
saved you from the dude,

38:56.001 --> 38:58.793
but I'd have beat him
with my left shoe.

38:58.920 --> 39:01.338
Hmm. I believe you.

39:03.759 --> 39:04.799
Come on, let's go.

39:04.926 --> 39:06.134
All right.

39:18.774 --> 39:20.440
Fine. One more drink.

39:20.525 --> 39:22.108
Half a glass. That is it.

39:22.194 --> 39:25.320
- A nightcap, if you will.
- Oh, I will...

39:25.447 --> 39:28.490
go to the bathroom, then I will
meet you in the living room.

39:28.617 --> 39:32.369
Hurry back, 'cause I'm gonna
pick out your best cabernet.

39:32.454 --> 39:34.320
Jesus! You scared me.
What are you doing?

39:34.414 --> 39:35.538
It's time for you to leave.

39:35.624 --> 39:37.323
We're having a nightcap.

39:37.417 --> 39:39.292
Have one at your own house.
It's late.

39:39.378 --> 39:40.993
But the car already left.

39:41.088 --> 39:42.545
Well, then call another one.

39:42.631 --> 39:44.923
What are you doing?
Get your hands off me.

39:45.008 --> 39:48.501
Don't you ever try
to do this to Jodi again.

39:48.595 --> 39:50.595
Do you understand me?

39:50.680 --> 39:51.679
Do what?

39:51.807 --> 39:53.515
Help her fail.

39:53.642 --> 39:56.142
I won't let you. Come on!

39:56.228 --> 40:00.021
What are you doing?
Get your hands off of me! Stop!

40:02.025 --> 40:03.316
[door closes]

40:10.033 --> 40:11.825
- Hey, Wendy!
- Hi.

40:11.910 --> 40:13.410
Where's Monica?

40:13.495 --> 40:15.245
She went home.

40:15.330 --> 40:18.415
She said something about wanting
to call it an early night.

40:18.500 --> 40:19.624
It's late.

40:19.709 --> 40:21.418
[laughs]
Come on.

40:21.503 --> 40:23.536
That doesn't sound
like Monica at all.

40:23.630 --> 40:26.464
Full disclosure,
she took off after I explained

40:26.550 --> 40:28.758
how much work we have
to knock out tomorrow.

40:29.970 --> 40:33.212
I may have been
a little insistent.

40:33.306 --> 40:36.382
- Wendy...
- I'm sorry, Jodi.

40:36.476 --> 40:40.687
It's just I really want this
project to go well for you.

40:40.772 --> 40:42.439
I know you do.

40:42.524 --> 40:44.399
You know, it's probably
for the best.

40:44.526 --> 40:47.944
Eric just texted me.
He's coming over in an hour.

40:48.029 --> 40:50.989
I shall say good night.

41:03.879 --> 41:05.086
[phone chimes]

41:10.302 --> 41:11.551
[door closes]

41:13.430 --> 41:15.889
Good morning. You showed up
pretty late last night.

41:15.974 --> 41:17.682
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

41:17.767 --> 41:19.726
You see my phone?

41:19.811 --> 41:22.187
Mm-mm, sorry.

41:24.024 --> 41:25.482
There it is.

41:26.735 --> 41:28.943
So Jodi's still sleeping?

41:29.070 --> 41:30.570
She is.

41:30.655 --> 41:32.605
A little too much wine.

41:32.699 --> 41:35.033
Maybe a little too much me.

41:35.118 --> 41:38.277
Sounds like a bad combination
for a productive morning.

41:38.371 --> 41:40.163
You got that right.

41:40.248 --> 41:43.875
So what do you have planned
for today?

41:43.960 --> 41:47.128
Lock myself in my office
until my inbox is empty.

41:49.049 --> 41:51.299
Well, I gotta get going.

41:51.426 --> 41:53.343
Take care of my girl,
will you?

41:53.428 --> 41:56.387
That's exactly
what I plan to do.

41:59.059 --> 42:01.309
- Good morning, sunshine.
- Morning.

42:01.436 --> 42:03.853
I poured you some fresh coffee,
if you'd like.

42:03.939 --> 42:05.897
Yes, need is more like it.

42:05.982 --> 42:07.857
I'm telling you,
I don't bounce back

42:07.943 --> 42:11.644
from these midweek late nights
the way I used to.

42:11.738 --> 42:14.155
Well, why don't you
take the morning to rest,

42:14.282 --> 42:16.533
and we'll get into
the restaurant stuff later.

42:18.286 --> 42:20.828
Guess I could do with a little
catch-up time around the house.

42:20.956 --> 42:22.705
What are you gonna do?

42:22.791 --> 42:24.374
Oh, hit a few stores.

42:24.459 --> 42:26.209
I'd like to check out
those mirrors we talked about.

42:26.294 --> 42:27.994
I think that you're right.

42:28.088 --> 42:29.879
They'll really make the entrance
feel a lot bigger.

42:29.965 --> 42:33.758
Well, sounds like a plan.
You're the best.

42:35.136 --> 42:37.053
Is Eric still here?

42:37.138 --> 42:38.846
He just left.
He said something about

42:38.974 --> 42:41.173
an important meeting
he had to get to.

42:41.268 --> 42:42.675
I should get going too,
I suppose.

42:42.769 --> 42:46.396
Thanks for
taking care of me, Wendy.

42:46.481 --> 42:48.606
It's what we do
for each other.

43:01.454 --> 43:04.914
[weights clanking]

43:19.389 --> 43:20.430
Boo!

43:23.184 --> 43:25.101
You got me.

43:25.186 --> 43:26.894
Mm-hmm, I sure did.

43:27.022 --> 43:29.939
Come on, Laura.
I need to get a quick workout in

43:30.025 --> 43:31.441
before I head back
to the office.

43:31.526 --> 43:33.484
I can give you
another workout.

43:35.655 --> 43:38.948
ERIC: Thanks for stopping by.
It was fun.

43:41.411 --> 43:44.412
Whatever.
You'll be calling me.

43:50.503 --> 43:53.963
[weights clanking]

44:09.606 --> 44:10.730
Boo.

44:10.815 --> 44:12.482
Laura, I just--

44:14.653 --> 44:15.443
Wendy?

44:15.570 --> 44:18.446
I'm confused, Eric.

44:18.573 --> 44:22.241
Didn't you say you had
to clear out your inbox?

44:22.327 --> 44:24.494
What are you doing
in my house?

44:24.579 --> 44:28.373
Not cheating on my fiancée,
that's for sure.

44:28.458 --> 44:29.666
And you?

44:29.751 --> 44:31.117
Oh, my--

44:31.211 --> 44:33.294
I'm just getting a workout
between my meetings.

44:33.421 --> 44:35.380
[chuckles]
Yeah.

44:35.465 --> 44:40.009
I heard you sweating it out with
your little girlfriend up there.

44:40.095 --> 44:42.970
You need to
mind your own business.

44:43.098 --> 44:45.473
- I'm serious.
- No.

44:45.600 --> 44:49.969
You're not serious, Eric.
That's the problem.

44:50.063 --> 44:53.106
You know that look you shot me
when we first met?

44:53.191 --> 44:55.650
That flirty little smirk?

44:55.777 --> 44:57.110
I bet you give that

44:57.195 --> 45:00.822
to every halfway decent girl
that you meet,

45:00.949 --> 45:03.449
like it's instinct.

45:03.535 --> 45:07.704
You're no good for her life.
She needs to know that.

45:07.789 --> 45:10.248
And who the hell
do you think you are?

45:10.333 --> 45:13.209
You have known Jodi
for a week.

45:13.294 --> 45:14.877
You don't know anything.

45:14.963 --> 45:16.829
[laughs]

45:16.923 --> 45:18.840
Well, I know this.

45:18.967 --> 45:21.500
Jodi's madly in love with me.

45:21.594 --> 45:23.302
And when I finally tell her

45:23.388 --> 45:25.471
that you've been hitting on me
since the day we met,

45:25.557 --> 45:29.058
you're gonna be a distant memory
in both of our lives.

45:29.144 --> 45:31.477
Your bond is nothing.

45:31.563 --> 45:34.647
Wendy, you are nothing.

45:37.193 --> 45:38.317
The truth is...

45:40.905 --> 45:43.355
I can do whatever I want
with Jodi,

45:43.450 --> 45:45.950
and there's nothing
that you can do about it.

46:10.602 --> 46:11.684
[thud]

46:11.770 --> 46:12.977
[Eric groans]

46:41.090 --> 46:43.800
Hey, you were gone awhile.

46:43.885 --> 46:45.417
Was I?

46:45.512 --> 46:47.419
Yeah, um, I guess.

46:47.514 --> 46:49.421
So I take it
you're feeling better?

46:49.516 --> 46:53.100
[chuckles]
I am. Thanks.

46:53.228 --> 46:56.521
Are you okay?
You look a little pale.

46:56.606 --> 46:57.772
Yeah, I'm fine.

46:57.899 --> 47:02.109
Actually,
I'm better than fine.

47:02.237 --> 47:03.653
I'm great.

47:03.738 --> 47:06.105
Did you get everything done
you wanted to?

47:06.199 --> 47:07.031
Mm-hmm.

47:07.116 --> 47:09.033
[doorbell rings]

47:09.118 --> 47:12.203
- Who's that?
- I have no idea.

47:17.210 --> 47:19.252
Hi. Can I help you?

47:19.337 --> 47:21.295
I'm looking for Jodi Shaw.

47:21.422 --> 47:22.630
That's me.

47:22.757 --> 47:25.591
I'm Detective Jessica Kessler.

47:25.677 --> 47:27.802
What's happened?

47:27.929 --> 47:32.131
Uh, ma'am, would it be okay
if I stepped inside,

47:32.225 --> 47:34.300
talk to you for a few minutes?

47:34.394 --> 47:37.770
- Um, yeah, sure, come in.
- Thank you.

47:42.902 --> 47:45.444
Do you know an Eric Thompson?

47:45.530 --> 47:47.613
He's my fiancé.

47:49.242 --> 47:50.533
Is he okay?

47:51.911 --> 47:55.830
No, ma'am, he's not.

47:55.957 --> 47:59.876
Um, there was an accident
earlier today.

47:59.961 --> 48:01.327
What happened?

48:01.421 --> 48:03.004
Someone struck him in the head

48:03.131 --> 48:04.964
while he was working out
at his home.

48:05.049 --> 48:07.049
What?

48:07.135 --> 48:09.051
Are you serious?

48:09.137 --> 48:10.803
Afraid I am.

48:10.889 --> 48:13.180
He's in a coma.

48:13.308 --> 48:15.600
So he's still alive?

48:15.685 --> 48:18.177
I mean, is he gonna be okay?

48:18.271 --> 48:20.980
That's all I know right now.

48:22.108 --> 48:25.443
Um... Uh...

48:25.528 --> 48:27.186
I...

48:27.280 --> 48:28.988
I don't understand.

48:30.491 --> 48:32.074
Who would've done this to him?

48:32.160 --> 48:35.161
Yeah, that's a good question.

48:35.246 --> 48:38.205
Please, Detective,
just tell me.

48:40.501 --> 48:42.752
Well, we do have
a person of interest.

48:42.837 --> 48:43.711
Who?

48:43.838 --> 48:45.338
A young woman named Laura Banks.

48:45.423 --> 48:50.209
We checked his phone,
and that's how I got to you.

48:50.303 --> 48:52.378
But there was also
a very recent text exchange

48:52.472 --> 48:56.715
about a rendezvous
at his place.

48:56.809 --> 48:59.018
What are you saying?

49:01.022 --> 49:03.522
Eric was screwing around on me?

49:03.608 --> 49:07.485
According to her,
yes, they were.

49:07.570 --> 49:12.564
She swears she left him alive
in his home after they were...

49:12.659 --> 49:14.566
done.

49:14.661 --> 49:17.328
I'm really very sorry.

49:19.707 --> 49:22.166
So I take it you didn't
know the other woman.

49:26.339 --> 49:27.797
Anyway, I wanted to come by

49:27.882 --> 49:29.840
and let you know
what happened myself.

49:31.970 --> 49:34.553
I've gotta get going,
but, um...

49:34.639 --> 49:38.808
if there are
any other questions,

49:38.893 --> 49:40.592
give me a call.

49:40.687 --> 49:41.978
Thank you.

49:42.063 --> 49:44.430
Thank you, Detective.
I'll take care of her now.

49:44.524 --> 49:46.023
Of course.

49:53.241 --> 49:54.156
Come here.

49:54.242 --> 49:55.408
[Jodi sobs]

49:55.493 --> 49:57.410
Come here, come here,
come here.

49:57.495 --> 50:01.163
It's okay, it's okay,
I'm here, I'm here.

50:01.249 --> 50:03.040
It's gonna be okay.

50:12.635 --> 50:14.626
I just called the hospital.

50:14.721 --> 50:16.462
And what did they say?

50:16.556 --> 50:19.298
How long will Eric
be in the coma?

50:19.392 --> 50:21.851
Nurse said with
his kind of head injury,

50:21.936 --> 50:24.020
it's hard to predict.

50:28.568 --> 50:30.693
I feel so bad for you, Jodi.

50:33.072 --> 50:37.649
I don't even know how
I'm supposed to feel right now.

50:37.744 --> 50:40.986
I mean, of course I want him
to be okay, but even if he is,

50:41.080 --> 50:44.823
I never want to see him again.

50:44.917 --> 50:47.043
What am I supposed
to do with that?

50:47.128 --> 50:50.880
Have you ever done a bad thing
for a good reason?

50:55.595 --> 50:56.886
What do you mean?

50:56.971 --> 51:00.347
I mean, perhaps
that's what happened here.

51:01.768 --> 51:03.175
I'm not following you.

51:03.269 --> 51:06.228
Maybe Eric knew in his heart

51:06.314 --> 51:09.515
that he was incapable
of giving you what you needed,

51:09.609 --> 51:11.275
what you deserved,

51:11.360 --> 51:13.778
and so he cheats,

51:13.863 --> 51:16.530
knowing full well
that you're not a fool,

51:16.657 --> 51:18.074
knowing that in time,

51:18.159 --> 51:21.577
you're more than likely
gonna catch him.

51:21.662 --> 51:24.205
Sometimes doing
the wrong thing

51:24.332 --> 51:26.999
is actually
the right thing to do.

51:30.963 --> 51:33.255
What? Why are you
looking at me like that?

51:33.341 --> 51:35.382
You're just a really good
person, Wendy.

51:35.510 --> 51:38.010
- I am?
- Mm-hmm.

51:38.096 --> 51:41.555
I know we haven't known
each other that long, but...

51:41.682 --> 51:44.383
you've been
a really good friend to me.

51:44.477 --> 51:46.811
I'd usually be leaning on Monica
right about now,

51:46.896 --> 51:49.063
but she's out of town
for a couple of days.

51:51.359 --> 51:53.317
I'm here for you...

51:53.402 --> 51:55.394
for anything that you need.

51:55.488 --> 51:58.030
I know.

51:58.116 --> 52:00.232
- [phone rings]
- Oh.

52:00.326 --> 52:04.236
Hey, sorry. I've been waiting
for this vendor to call.

52:04.330 --> 52:06.288
- Take it, take it.
- Thanks.

52:06.374 --> 52:08.791
I need to get myself together
anyway.

52:08.876 --> 52:11.168
Roy called. He wants to meet
at his office later.

52:11.254 --> 52:12.336
Mm-hmm.

52:14.507 --> 52:16.257
- Derek?
- How's it going, sugar?

52:16.384 --> 52:19.301
- Why are you calling me?
- We need to talk.

52:19.387 --> 52:22.596
There's nothing to talk about.
What we did, it's over now.

52:22.723 --> 52:26.392
Yeah, yeah, it is, but you know,
I've been thinking

52:26.477 --> 52:28.936
about all those fancy Hollywood
actors and what they've earned

52:29.063 --> 52:31.063
for doing what I did,
you know, pretending

52:31.149 --> 52:33.098
and making it look real?

52:33.192 --> 52:34.525
Just tell me what you want.

52:34.610 --> 52:37.653
Two words:
additional compensation.

52:37.738 --> 52:39.572
I'm gonna need
another three grand,

52:39.657 --> 52:42.199
or whatever you got going on
there with that pretty lady

52:42.285 --> 52:46.078
gets scorched to the Earth with
one anonymous little phone call.

52:46.164 --> 52:51.116
Well, doesn't seem like I have
much of a choice then, does it?

52:51.210 --> 52:55.129
Ah, hell! We all have choices.
I'm making one right now.

52:55.256 --> 52:57.548
What's yours gonna be, hmm?

52:59.510 --> 53:00.792
You win.

53:00.887 --> 53:02.803
Let's get together,
and we can work it out.

53:02.930 --> 53:06.098
Thought you'd see it my way.
When?

53:06.184 --> 53:07.474
What are you doing later?

53:07.602 --> 53:10.135
Meeting up with you, I guess.

53:10.229 --> 53:11.470
Same place?

53:11.564 --> 53:13.606
You got it.

53:16.777 --> 53:17.809
ROY: Jeez, Jodi.

53:17.904 --> 53:22.481
Listen, what happened
with Eric,

53:22.575 --> 53:25.484
it's a tragedy
any way you look at it.

53:25.578 --> 53:29.455
Yeah, well, since it happened
while he was cheating on me,

53:29.540 --> 53:32.374
the only way I look at it
is over.

53:33.961 --> 53:37.046
I feel so bad for you.

53:37.131 --> 53:39.331
Wendy said the same thing.

53:39.425 --> 53:42.167
She's been so great
about everything.

53:42.261 --> 53:43.677
So she's working out?

53:43.804 --> 53:45.054
You don't like her?

53:45.139 --> 53:49.007
No. I mean,
she seems perfectly nice.

53:49.101 --> 53:51.185
It's just...

53:51.312 --> 53:52.561
Just say it.

53:52.647 --> 53:54.513
Well, I was there when you
caught her in that lie

53:54.607 --> 53:56.181
about getting a college degree
someday.

53:56.275 --> 53:59.851
Really? You're worried
about that?

53:59.946 --> 54:03.030
How many people lie on their
résumé a little to get a job?

54:03.157 --> 54:05.991
Yeah, I guess you're right.

54:07.662 --> 54:11.580
Hey, so here's a crazy idea,

54:11.666 --> 54:14.583
and feel free to say no
if it's too much, but...

54:14.669 --> 54:17.369
how do you feel about having
dinner with me Friday night?

54:17.463 --> 54:21.382
You mean like as a work thing?

54:21.509 --> 54:24.051
[laughs]
No, no.

54:24.178 --> 54:27.054
Like a...
Like an adult thing.

54:27.181 --> 54:30.557
And we can talk about work
as much as you want.

54:30.685 --> 54:33.051
Clearly, this has been
a rough week.

54:33.145 --> 54:36.939
Just let me buy you a meal.

54:38.276 --> 54:40.776
Um...

54:40.861 --> 54:43.445
Sure, why not?
It's just dinner.

54:43.531 --> 54:44.896
Okay.

54:44.991 --> 54:47.700
So, um, I'll call you
to make a plan,

54:47.785 --> 54:51.370
and for now just go home
and take care of yourself, okay?

54:51.455 --> 54:54.573
Yeah, sounds good.
Thanks, Roy.

54:54.667 --> 54:55.916
Of course.

55:09.056 --> 55:13.267
Dave. Hey, it's Roy.
How are you doing?

55:13.394 --> 55:15.602
Yeah, great.
Listen, I have a question.

55:15.730 --> 55:17.429
Do you still have
your toes dipped

55:17.523 --> 55:19.898
in that private investigator
thing?

55:21.694 --> 55:25.154
Good. No, no,
I'm gonna need a favor.

55:27.533 --> 55:29.941
- [phone ringing]
- Where the hell is this girl?

55:30.036 --> 55:32.444
[ringing continues]

55:32.538 --> 55:34.580
Where are you? I've been
waiting here 20 minutes.

55:34.665 --> 55:37.291
WENDY: Relax.
I'm just about there.

55:37.418 --> 55:38.950
I got what you're asking for.

55:39.045 --> 55:41.670
Good. And hey, I hope
there's no hard feelings.

55:41.756 --> 55:45.299
I mean, this is just business,
nothing personal.

55:45.426 --> 55:46.842
Nah, you were right.

55:46.927 --> 55:50.962
You definitely deserved
more than what you got.

55:51.057 --> 55:53.766
Where are you?
I still don't see you.

55:55.186 --> 55:57.019
Hello? Hello?

55:58.439 --> 56:00.731
Remember before when you said
we all have a choice?

56:00.816 --> 56:02.566
You chose wrong!

56:02.651 --> 56:03.650
[stab]

56:08.949 --> 56:11.867
Jodi? Jodi, are you here?

56:12.787 --> 56:14.986
Don't you ever leave?

56:15.081 --> 56:18.332
- Don't you ever knock first?
- Just got back into town.

56:18.459 --> 56:20.209
I heard about
what happened to Eric.

56:20.294 --> 56:25.631
Yeah. What happened to her
cheating fiancé was terrible.

56:25.716 --> 56:27.383
Where is Jodi?

56:27.468 --> 56:29.167
Oh, you just missed her.

56:29.261 --> 56:31.220
She left for dinner
with a client.

56:31.305 --> 56:33.597
Fine. Well, she can
meet up with me after, then.

56:33.682 --> 56:38.310
Hmm. Yeah, I don't think that's
a good idea.

56:38.396 --> 56:41.680
You don't? And why not?

56:41.774 --> 56:45.776
Because your life is... messy.

56:45.861 --> 56:47.277
[scoffs]

56:47.363 --> 56:50.322
You know, I'm starting
to get real sick of you.

56:50.408 --> 56:54.576
Same. And like
I told you before,

56:54.662 --> 56:57.996
Jodi has no use for
your kind of help anymore.

56:58.082 --> 56:59.832
She has me now.

56:59.917 --> 57:02.209
And who are you, Wendy?

57:02.336 --> 57:04.128
We really don't know, do we?

57:04.213 --> 57:07.756
I know it's hard for you
to wrap your head around this,

57:07.842 --> 57:10.426
but she doesn't
need you anymore.

57:10.511 --> 57:14.045
Oh, and she needs you?
You're just a kid.

57:14.140 --> 57:16.882
Do you really think you're gonna
keep me from my best friend?

57:16.976 --> 57:21.228
- How many times must I--
- Just listen to me, Wendy!

57:21.355 --> 57:23.889
At some point soon,
Jodi's gonna make a choice,

57:23.983 --> 57:26.775
so give up on this
big sister-little sister vibe

57:26.861 --> 57:28.277
you're trying
to build with her

57:28.362 --> 57:31.447
because she will choose me,
I promise you that.

57:31.532 --> 57:36.243
Right now she's just paying you
back for saving her or whatever.

57:36.370 --> 57:38.120
But when she's finished
with that,

57:38.205 --> 57:40.831
you'll head back to whatever
hole you crawled out of,

57:40.916 --> 57:43.000
and the rest of us will get back
to our regular lives,

57:43.085 --> 57:45.377
messy as they might be.

57:45.463 --> 57:47.713
I'll let her know
you stopped by.

57:47.798 --> 57:48.755
Don't bother.

57:48.883 --> 57:51.082
I'll just text her.

57:51.177 --> 57:52.968
Yeah, you do that.

57:53.053 --> 57:55.420
I'm sure she'll
get right back to you.

57:55.514 --> 57:56.763
[door slams]

58:08.569 --> 58:12.362
I'm really glad
you came out with me tonight.

58:12.448 --> 58:15.157
I know how tough
this week has been.

58:17.495 --> 58:18.944
Jodi.

58:19.038 --> 58:21.371
- Yeah. Hi.
- Hi.

58:21.457 --> 58:22.447
Sorry.

58:22.541 --> 58:24.783
Everything okay over there?

58:24.877 --> 58:25.834
Was this too soon?

58:25.920 --> 58:27.002
No, no, no.

58:27.087 --> 58:29.254
No, I'm fine, I think.

58:30.883 --> 58:35.177
I need a friend right now,
so thank you for taking me out.

58:35.262 --> 58:37.012
Yeah.

58:37.097 --> 58:38.296
Anytime.

58:38.390 --> 58:42.351
Oh, I almost forgot.
Wendy was gonna text me

58:42.436 --> 58:44.603
about a quote
for a ceiling fan.

58:44.688 --> 58:46.104
Okay, hold on, hold on,
hold on.

58:46.190 --> 58:47.606
As your employer,

58:47.691 --> 58:52.152
I salute your after-work hours
dedication to the job,

58:52.279 --> 58:55.364
but as the guy
paying for this meal--

58:55.449 --> 58:57.649
- What's wrong?
- I can't believe it.

58:57.743 --> 58:59.326
I've left my phone at home.

59:00.454 --> 59:01.745
[phone chimes]

59:19.807 --> 59:22.173
I know. I'm worried
about her too, Kate.

59:22.268 --> 59:24.843
I just sent her a text to see
if she wants to come over.

59:24.937 --> 59:28.480
- [phone chimes]
- Hold on. Maybe that's her.

59:31.402 --> 59:34.686
Great. She's on her way.
Talk to you later.

59:34.780 --> 59:36.113
Okay, bye.

59:37.116 --> 59:38.240
[chimes]

59:40.244 --> 59:41.618
[scoffs]

59:41.704 --> 59:43.245
You sure will.

59:51.171 --> 59:54.673
So while we're on
the subject of Wendy,

59:54.758 --> 59:57.092
um...

59:57.177 --> 1:00:00.429
a friend of mine does some
private investigation,

1:00:00.514 --> 1:00:04.224
and I asked him
to dig into her a little.

1:00:04.351 --> 1:00:07.102
Really? Why?

1:00:07.187 --> 1:00:08.937
I'm just looking out for you...

1:00:09.023 --> 1:00:11.648
and for my business,
as you brought her on board.

1:00:11.734 --> 1:00:13.442
Look, the only thing I know

1:00:13.527 --> 1:00:17.070
is that she may or may not be
lying about her education,

1:00:17.197 --> 1:00:18.864
And?

1:00:18.949 --> 1:00:21.491
And my friend couldn't find
anything bad about her.

1:00:21.577 --> 1:00:25.120
I'm not surprised.

1:00:25.205 --> 1:00:26.905
Or anything good.

1:00:26.999 --> 1:00:28.665
He couldn't find anything.

1:00:28.751 --> 1:00:31.126
She has no online profiles,

1:00:31.211 --> 1:00:35.005
no pictures,
no social media accounts,

1:00:35.090 --> 1:00:36.089
nothing.

1:00:36.216 --> 1:00:37.582
Are you seriously telling me

1:00:37.676 --> 1:00:40.135
that you don't find this
a little bit strange?

1:00:40.220 --> 1:00:42.587
Actually,
I find it refreshing,

1:00:42.681 --> 1:00:44.848
someone her age
who isn't obsessed

1:00:44.933 --> 1:00:46.257
with taking endless selfies

1:00:46.352 --> 1:00:48.310
or posting pictures
of last night's dinner.

1:00:48.395 --> 1:00:50.428
Yeah, because
she's obsessed with you.

1:00:50.522 --> 1:00:52.606
What are you talking about?

1:00:52.733 --> 1:00:54.691
I saw the way
she looks at you.

1:00:56.779 --> 1:00:58.236
And that equals obsession.

1:00:58.322 --> 1:01:00.572
I should introduce you
to my friend Monica.

1:01:00.658 --> 1:01:03.408
You and her can sit around
and talk about

1:01:03.494 --> 1:01:07.537
what a lying, lowdown
manipulator Wendy Richards is.

1:01:07.623 --> 1:01:08.830
[phone chimes]

1:01:21.470 --> 1:01:23.261
I know you see Wendy
as your hero.

1:01:23.347 --> 1:01:25.806
Well, the truth is, you don't
know anything about her.

1:01:25.933 --> 1:01:29.101
I appreciate your concern,
Roy, I do,

1:01:29.186 --> 1:01:32.145
but I've spent enough time
around Wendy now

1:01:32.272 --> 1:01:35.023
to know that she's
a total sweetheart.

1:01:35.109 --> 1:01:36.733
Don't worry.

1:01:36.819 --> 1:01:38.610
If you say so.

1:01:47.454 --> 1:01:49.496
Jodi, are you here?

1:01:50.958 --> 1:01:53.208
I thought I heard you come in.

1:01:53.293 --> 1:01:54.626
[thud]

1:01:58.590 --> 1:01:59.923
[phone ringing]

1:02:05.264 --> 1:02:06.722
Hey, Kate. What's up?

1:02:06.807 --> 1:02:08.673
First thing, I'm so sorry

1:02:08.767 --> 1:02:10.934
about the whole situation
with Eric.

1:02:12.229 --> 1:02:15.013
Thanks.
What's the second thing?

1:02:15.107 --> 1:02:17.357
Have you heard from Monica?

1:02:17.484 --> 1:02:19.350
We were supposed
to get together today,

1:02:19.445 --> 1:02:20.736
and I can't find her.

1:02:20.821 --> 1:02:23.447
No. I have no idea
where she is.

1:02:24.992 --> 1:02:27.859
Oh. I thought
maybe you would.

1:02:27.953 --> 1:02:29.161
Why would I?

1:02:29.246 --> 1:02:31.788
Because I was
on the phone with her

1:02:31.874 --> 1:02:33.457
when you two were texting

1:02:33.542 --> 1:02:36.460
about you going to her place
last night.

1:02:36.545 --> 1:02:38.003
That wasn't me.

1:02:38.088 --> 1:02:41.465
I didn't even know
she was back in town yet.

1:02:41.550 --> 1:02:43.258
I left my phone at home.

1:02:45.804 --> 1:02:49.473
Um, look just let me know
when you hear from her, okay?

1:02:49.558 --> 1:02:51.349
I will.

1:02:59.318 --> 1:03:00.358
Hey, Jodi?

1:03:02.571 --> 1:03:04.654
Hey, what's up?

1:03:04.740 --> 1:03:06.573
I was just gonna make myself
some lunch.

1:03:06.700 --> 1:03:07.949
Do you want anything?

1:03:08.035 --> 1:03:09.659
No, I'm good, thank you.

1:03:10.871 --> 1:03:12.204
Are you okay?

1:03:12.289 --> 1:03:14.498
You look a little... off.

1:03:14.583 --> 1:03:19.711
No, no, I'm-- I'm just trying
to figure something out.

1:03:21.048 --> 1:03:23.465
Well, good luck.
I'm sure that you will.

1:03:51.703 --> 1:03:54.663
So you got my email, right?
You know what you're doing?

1:03:54.748 --> 1:03:56.281
Yep, got it.

1:03:56.375 --> 1:03:59.751
Sorry. I know I've kind of
overloaded you with tasks today,

1:03:59.837 --> 1:04:01.711
but if we don't
knock these out,

1:04:01.797 --> 1:04:03.129
we're gonna
fall behind schedule.

1:04:03.257 --> 1:04:05.957
Anything I can do
to help you, Jodi.

1:04:06.051 --> 1:04:07.717
That's why I'm here.

1:04:09.346 --> 1:04:10.470
Call me with any problems.

1:04:10.597 --> 1:04:13.306
Now why would I have
any problems?

1:06:02.542 --> 1:06:04.909
That's...

1:06:05.003 --> 1:06:06.211
That's me.

1:06:07.464 --> 1:06:12.092
Wait, so Wendy went
to Camp Beaverbrook?

1:06:13.720 --> 1:06:16.513
Oh, my God, we've met before.

1:06:26.274 --> 1:06:27.649
- [door opens]
- [click]

1:06:27.734 --> 1:06:29.109
Hello?

1:06:48.088 --> 1:06:50.880
Elana. I remember you.

1:06:52.759 --> 1:06:55.802
Let's see if you
can explain this.

1:07:00.267 --> 1:07:04.635
Hi, is Elana Connelly there?

1:07:04.730 --> 1:07:06.471
She's not.

1:07:06.565 --> 1:07:08.732
Yeah, could I get
her number please?

1:07:10.235 --> 1:07:11.809
Sure. My name is Jodi Shaw.

1:07:11.903 --> 1:07:13.820
I used to work with her
at Camp Beaverbrook,

1:07:13.947 --> 1:07:16.406
and I would love to catch up.

1:07:18.285 --> 1:07:19.576
Uh-huh.

1:07:23.749 --> 1:07:25.373
[whinnies]

1:07:25.459 --> 1:07:27.584
Very, very good. Wow.

1:07:27.669 --> 1:07:28.793
Beautiful horse.

1:07:28.879 --> 1:07:29.961
[phone ringing]

1:07:31.882 --> 1:07:33.164
Hello.

1:07:33.258 --> 1:07:35.300
- Hi, is this Elana?
- Yes, it is.

1:07:35.385 --> 1:07:38.836
Hi, Elana.
Uh, this is Jodi Shaw.

1:07:38.930 --> 1:07:42.098
You probably don't remember me,
but I used to work for you

1:07:42.184 --> 1:07:45.009
about 15 years ago
at Camp Beaverbrook.

1:07:45.103 --> 1:07:46.844
One of my lifeguards, right?

1:07:46.938 --> 1:07:50.231
Yeah, so you do remember me.

1:07:50.317 --> 1:07:52.442
Well, to be honest with you--

1:07:52.527 --> 1:07:54.852
please don't be insulted--

1:07:54.946 --> 1:07:58.022
um, I probably wouldn't have.

1:07:58.116 --> 1:08:01.159
So many great people have come
and gone through the years

1:08:01.244 --> 1:08:02.744
in this place.

1:08:02.829 --> 1:08:04.362
But...

1:08:04.456 --> 1:08:09.167
Oh, sorry, but there was
another Beaverbrook alumni

1:08:09.252 --> 1:08:11.419
who called me
just a couple of weeks ago,

1:08:11.505 --> 1:08:13.004
asking for your name.

1:08:13.090 --> 1:08:16.007
Let me guess.
Wendy Richards?

1:08:18.345 --> 1:08:20.378
Well, you've got
the first name right,

1:08:20.472 --> 1:08:22.806
but her last name
isn't Richards.

1:08:22.891 --> 1:08:24.349
It's, uh, Edelman.

1:08:24.434 --> 1:08:28.219
I went back through
my records to verify that.

1:08:28.313 --> 1:08:31.731
Can I ask what else
your records say about her?

1:08:31.858 --> 1:08:34.109
Well, I took
some pretty good notes.

1:08:34.194 --> 1:08:37.487
I always do when there's
a camper-related incident.

1:08:37.572 --> 1:08:41.324
It seems that Wendy
was a very shy girl

1:08:41.409 --> 1:08:45.870
who panicked in the deep end
of the pool and almost drowned.

1:08:45.956 --> 1:08:49.574
Fortunately, the lifeguard
on duty did her job

1:08:49.668 --> 1:08:51.075
and saved her life,

1:08:51.169 --> 1:08:53.586
and that would have been you.

1:08:53.713 --> 1:08:57.048
So when she called me
for your name

1:08:57.134 --> 1:08:59.342
so she could thank you,
I gave it to her.

1:08:59.427 --> 1:09:01.928
I don't understand
why she would give you

1:09:02.055 --> 1:09:03.921
a different last name though.

1:09:04.015 --> 1:09:07.475
I should've asked
before I gave her yours.

1:09:07.561 --> 1:09:09.060
You don't remember her?

1:09:10.897 --> 1:09:12.564
No, I--

1:09:12.649 --> 1:09:15.600
God, I don't remember
saving Wendy at all.

1:09:15.694 --> 1:09:18.611
I must have pulled ten kids
out of that pool every summer.

1:09:18.738 --> 1:09:20.655
Like you said,
that was the job.

1:09:20.740 --> 1:09:22.323
According to my notes,

1:09:22.409 --> 1:09:25.610
her mom pulled her from camp
the next day and that was it.

1:09:25.704 --> 1:09:29.080
Well, not exactly.

1:09:29.166 --> 1:09:31.457
Oh, she found you, huh?

1:09:31.585 --> 1:09:34.619
Yeah, but she didn't tell me
that we knew each other.

1:09:34.713 --> 1:09:39.007
She actually introduced herself
to me by saving my life.

1:09:39.092 --> 1:09:40.300
What?

1:09:40.427 --> 1:09:42.293
So I gave her a job
to say thank you

1:09:42.387 --> 1:09:43.628
and a room in my house
to live.

1:09:43.722 --> 1:09:45.346
Now I don't know
what to think.

1:09:45.432 --> 1:09:49.058
Oh, Jodi,
I am so very sorry.

1:09:49.144 --> 1:09:51.186
I don't know what to say.

1:09:51.271 --> 1:09:53.813
Oh, you couldn't have known.

1:09:53.940 --> 1:09:56.474
Well, are you going
to the police?

1:09:56.568 --> 1:09:59.977
With what? I mean...

1:10:00.071 --> 1:10:02.113
I don't have any proof
that she's done anything

1:10:02.199 --> 1:10:05.658
other than give me
a different last name.

1:10:07.621 --> 1:10:09.662
You know, I'm gonna have
to go now, Elana.

1:10:09.789 --> 1:10:10.914
Thank you so much.

1:10:25.639 --> 1:10:27.171
You've reached the office of--

1:10:27.265 --> 1:10:28.932
Damn it. Voicemail.

1:10:32.604 --> 1:10:34.771
Okay, that's not too far away.

1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:56.751
I don't understand.

1:10:56.836 --> 1:10:57.752
No.

1:10:57.837 --> 1:11:00.255
No, this doesn't make any sense.

1:11:01.508 --> 1:11:03.758
How does she not know?

1:11:03.843 --> 1:11:06.377
How does she not know?

1:11:06.471 --> 1:11:08.346
How does she not know?

1:11:08.431 --> 1:11:10.640
How does she not know?!

1:11:14.980 --> 1:11:17.438
It's because she doesn't care.

1:11:36.543 --> 1:11:38.793
Jodi, we need to talk.

1:11:43.341 --> 1:11:44.841
[knocking]

1:11:46.052 --> 1:11:48.845
Oh, hello.
Can I help you?

1:11:48.930 --> 1:11:51.014
I hope so.
Are you Dr. Farber?

1:11:51.099 --> 1:11:52.423
I am.

1:11:52.517 --> 1:11:54.475
I wanted to talk to you
about someone I know,

1:11:54.561 --> 1:11:56.311
someone I think is
a patient of yours.

1:11:56.396 --> 1:12:00.097
I'm sorry. I'm not permitted
to speak about my patients.

1:12:00.191 --> 1:12:03.609
I've driven a really long way
to talk to you face-to-face.

1:12:03.737 --> 1:12:05.611
And I can see
you're really serious,

1:12:05.739 --> 1:12:07.780
but again,
there's nothing I could do.

1:12:07.907 --> 1:12:10.867
Well, can I just ask you
one question?

1:12:10.952 --> 1:12:12.994
Is Wendy Edelman dangerous?

1:12:14.539 --> 1:12:17.165
Like I said,
I've got some questions.

1:12:19.711 --> 1:12:21.127
Well, have a seat.

1:12:21.254 --> 1:12:22.795
Thank you.

1:12:27.260 --> 1:12:30.303
How do you know Wendy
was my patient?

1:12:30.430 --> 1:12:32.722
I saw that you texted her
this week,

1:12:32.807 --> 1:12:35.641
and I found your contact info
on her laptop.

1:12:37.270 --> 1:12:38.936
Oh.

1:12:39.022 --> 1:12:41.481
So you're her,

1:12:41.608 --> 1:12:43.524
the young woman
who saved her life.

1:12:43.610 --> 1:12:45.943
She didn't know your name.

1:12:46.029 --> 1:12:47.236
It's Jodi Shaw.

1:12:47.322 --> 1:12:50.481
How did Wendy approach you?

1:12:50.575 --> 1:12:53.743
By saving me from a mugger.

1:12:55.080 --> 1:12:58.581
An act I rewarded
with friendship, job,

1:12:58.666 --> 1:13:00.792
a place to live.

1:13:00.877 --> 1:13:03.586
And since then,
my fiancé is in a coma,

1:13:03.671 --> 1:13:05.630
and my best friend is MIA.

1:13:05.715 --> 1:13:07.131
Oh, my goodness.

1:13:07.217 --> 1:13:09.500
That's why I really needed
to talk to you.

1:13:09.594 --> 1:13:11.636
Please, Dr. Farber,

1:13:11.721 --> 1:13:13.888
anything that
you can tell me about her.

1:13:16.309 --> 1:13:17.767
I can say this.

1:13:17.852 --> 1:13:21.345
You've never really left
Wendy's thoughts since that day.

1:13:21.439 --> 1:13:24.181
Those things happen in public
pools and beaches all the time.

1:13:24.275 --> 1:13:29.404
But it's the last
act of kindness she ever had.

1:13:29.489 --> 1:13:33.533
Her folks died in a car accident
after that summer,

1:13:33.660 --> 1:13:35.827
and she went to live
with her grandma.

1:13:35.912 --> 1:13:37.703
Poor thing, she spent
all her time in a cold house

1:13:37.831 --> 1:13:40.415
with a cold woman
who didn't want her

1:13:40.500 --> 1:13:42.625
and made sure she knew it.

1:13:42.710 --> 1:13:44.368
I had no idea.

1:13:44.462 --> 1:13:47.213
She felt worthless.
She never made any friends.

1:13:47.340 --> 1:13:49.132
Wound up in a deep depression.

1:13:49.217 --> 1:13:52.051
Came to me a year ago
when her grandma died.

1:13:52.178 --> 1:13:55.346
We talked about a lot of things,
but it always came back

1:13:55.432 --> 1:13:58.891
to that beautiful girl
who found her worth rescuing.

1:13:59.018 --> 1:14:00.551
I don't understand.

1:14:00.645 --> 1:14:02.979
Why wouldn't she come
and see me before now?

1:14:03.064 --> 1:14:05.890
She thought you would reject her
the moment you saw her again,

1:14:05.984 --> 1:14:08.276
like everyone else in her life.

1:14:08.361 --> 1:14:10.060
Now, we worked on it.

1:14:10.155 --> 1:14:12.155
I helped her build
her confidence.

1:14:12.240 --> 1:14:15.566
I knew she had thoughts
about finding you

1:14:15.660 --> 1:14:17.785
and reuniting
with her childhood hero,

1:14:17.871 --> 1:14:19.871
but I didn't know she was
gonna go out and do it.

1:14:19.956 --> 1:14:21.956
And now with this
mugger thing...

1:14:24.544 --> 1:14:28.629
Wendy has a savior complex,
and I just missed it completely.

1:14:28.715 --> 1:14:30.080
What's that?

1:14:30.175 --> 1:14:32.383
Someone who has a need
to save other people.

1:14:32.469 --> 1:14:36.053
Hers is exclusive with you,
so you-- you--

1:14:36.139 --> 1:14:39.256
could feel the exact same bond
for her as she feels for you.

1:14:39.350 --> 1:14:44.428
God, to think that she's been
clinging on to this memory

1:14:44.522 --> 1:14:49.767
all these years of me
making her feel safe and secure.

1:14:49.861 --> 1:14:51.769
Back to my original question.

1:14:51.863 --> 1:14:54.405
Dr. Farber, is she dangerous?

1:14:54.491 --> 1:14:56.106
Wendy has issues,

1:14:56.201 --> 1:15:00.277
but no, I never saw anything
that would make me think that.

1:15:00.371 --> 1:15:02.446
Me either.

1:15:02.540 --> 1:15:04.540
So did she set up the mugging?

1:15:04.626 --> 1:15:06.667
No. No, I don't--

1:15:06.753 --> 1:15:08.711
I don't think so.

1:15:08.796 --> 1:15:12.456
I'm sure Eric's injury
was his own fault,

1:15:12.550 --> 1:15:15.292
and my friend
will turn up soon.

1:15:15.386 --> 1:15:17.470
So what are you gonna do now?

1:15:19.098 --> 1:15:21.015
I'll talk to her,
tell her what I know,

1:15:21.100 --> 1:15:22.850
try and get her
the help that she needs.

1:15:22.936 --> 1:15:26.854
That's very kind of you,
but be careful.

1:15:26.940 --> 1:15:29.148
She's a damaged girl.

1:15:31.027 --> 1:15:32.735
[phone ringing]

1:15:36.241 --> 1:15:37.156
Hey, Jodi.

1:15:37.283 --> 1:15:38.824
Wendy, hi, how are you?

1:15:38.952 --> 1:15:40.535
Oh, I'm all right.

1:15:40.620 --> 1:15:42.036
I'm kind of having
a strange day,

1:15:42.121 --> 1:15:43.996
but I'm getting
a handle on it now.

1:15:44.123 --> 1:15:46.040
Yeah, same here.

1:15:46.125 --> 1:15:48.325
I'm just about to head home.
Will you be there?

1:15:48.419 --> 1:15:51.495
Of course.
Is anything wrong?

1:15:51.589 --> 1:15:54.090
No, no, I just wanna
have a talk.

1:15:54.175 --> 1:15:56.834
Good. Me too.

1:15:56.928 --> 1:15:58.678
I'll be there soon.

1:15:58.805 --> 1:16:01.672
Take your time, Jodi.
Don't speed.

1:16:01.766 --> 1:16:04.016
That's how accidents happen.

1:16:26.708 --> 1:16:27.957
[line ringing]

1:16:28.042 --> 1:16:31.335
Hi, this is Jodi Shaw.
Do you remember me?

1:16:31.421 --> 1:16:33.370
- [doorbell rings]
- [door opens]

1:16:33.464 --> 1:16:35.706
WENDY: Roy,
what are you doing here?

1:16:35.800 --> 1:16:37.592
Just wanted to have
a little chat.

1:16:37.677 --> 1:16:41.211
Oh, well, Jodi's not here
right now, so...

1:16:41.306 --> 1:16:43.931
That's okay. I actually came by
to talk to you.

1:16:44.017 --> 1:16:48.936
Oh, okay. I'm actually
in the mood for a talk.

1:16:49.022 --> 1:16:51.272
What is it that
you wanted to chat about?

1:16:51.357 --> 1:16:53.316
Just have a few questions.

1:16:53.401 --> 1:16:55.693
About the project?

1:16:55.778 --> 1:16:57.236
About your past.

1:16:58.865 --> 1:17:01.949
And what is it
that you know about it?

1:17:02.035 --> 1:17:03.200
Not a thing.

1:17:03.286 --> 1:17:06.912
Not even after
some looking into.

1:17:07.040 --> 1:17:11.075
So I just don't think
this is a healthy situation.

1:17:11.169 --> 1:17:13.252
You mean for the restaurant?

1:17:13.379 --> 1:17:15.212
I mean around Jodi.

1:17:15.298 --> 1:17:16.714
[phone chimes]

1:17:17.967 --> 1:17:19.300
Damn it.

1:17:19.385 --> 1:17:23.137
Got a problem with one of
my east coast restaurants.

1:17:24.682 --> 1:17:27.058
We're gonna have to pick this up
another time.

1:17:29.520 --> 1:17:32.855
[door opens, closes]

1:17:36.277 --> 1:17:38.027
[sighs]

1:17:40.531 --> 1:17:43.866
[panting]

1:17:47.872 --> 1:17:50.956
Oh, you're gonna remember me
this time, Jodi.

1:17:51.084 --> 1:17:53.334
I promise you will.

1:18:02.095 --> 1:18:03.219
[door closes]

1:18:04.430 --> 1:18:05.796
Oh, hey, Wendy.

1:18:05.890 --> 1:18:07.473
I thought I heard you
pulling up.

1:18:07.600 --> 1:18:10.309
Come on,
let's have that talk.

1:18:10.436 --> 1:18:12.978
Um, before we get started, I...

1:18:13.106 --> 1:18:16.148
I just want to tell you
that I know.

1:18:16.275 --> 1:18:18.651
That you know what?

1:18:18.778 --> 1:18:21.529
About how you and I
have met before.

1:18:21.614 --> 1:18:25.116
I found the photograph
on your laptop,

1:18:25.201 --> 1:18:26.742
of the two of us together

1:18:26.828 --> 1:18:30.037
at Camp Beaverbrook
all those years ago.

1:18:31.290 --> 1:18:32.707
You got me.

1:18:32.792 --> 1:18:36.827
Honestly, I'm relieved.

1:18:36.921 --> 1:18:40.005
It's been really hard
not telling you from the start.

1:18:40.133 --> 1:18:43.259
Thank you for
being honest with me.

1:18:45.805 --> 1:18:48.681
You wanna talk, let's talk.

1:18:48.808 --> 1:18:52.676
But yell for help, and I'll
end the conversation fast.

1:18:52.770 --> 1:18:55.146
My God.

1:18:55.231 --> 1:18:57.648
Wendy, what did you do?

1:18:57.734 --> 1:19:03.028
Oh, Jodi, I've been doing
exactly what we talked about

1:19:03.156 --> 1:19:04.447
since we connected.

1:19:04.532 --> 1:19:09.693
After saving you,
it became my responsibility

1:19:09.787 --> 1:19:14.206
to make your life
as perfect as I could.

1:19:14.333 --> 1:19:18.535
I had no idea
just how... cluttered

1:19:18.629 --> 1:19:21.046
your life would actually be.

1:19:21.174 --> 1:19:22.548
What are you saying?

1:19:22.675 --> 1:19:25.342
Don't you get it, Jodi?

1:19:25.428 --> 1:19:28.721
I did all of this for you,

1:19:28.848 --> 1:19:32.883
to repay you for what you did
for me that day.

1:19:32.977 --> 1:19:36.887
When my witch of a grandmother
finally croaked,

1:19:36.981 --> 1:19:40.566
I just didn't need
a fresh start.

1:19:40.693 --> 1:19:44.862
I needed a whole new... life,

1:19:44.947 --> 1:19:50.910
and I wanted my very first
actual friend...

1:19:51.037 --> 1:19:52.620
to be you.

1:19:54.040 --> 1:19:57.333
So yes, Jodi,

1:19:57.418 --> 1:19:59.910
I did set up that mugging

1:20:00.004 --> 1:20:05.090
so you'd feel
exactly how I felt

1:20:05.218 --> 1:20:06.759
this whole time.

1:20:06.886 --> 1:20:08.761
But none of that matters now.

1:20:08.888 --> 1:20:12.640
There's only one way
for this to end,

1:20:12.725 --> 1:20:15.893
and neither of us
are being saved tonight.

1:20:15.978 --> 1:20:17.895
Wait, Wendy, I--

1:20:17.980 --> 1:20:19.930
Listen to me.

1:20:20.024 --> 1:20:21.765
I spoke with Dr. Farber.

1:20:21.859 --> 1:20:27.771
She told me about
how you grew up...

1:20:27.865 --> 1:20:30.574
unloved, uncared for.

1:20:30.660 --> 1:20:34.537
No one could blame you
for holding on to that summer.

1:20:34.622 --> 1:20:37.998
If that was the last time
you experienced...

1:20:38.084 --> 1:20:41.168
kindness, felt safe...

1:20:43.089 --> 1:20:45.256
then I'm so, so sorry, Wendy.

1:20:46.759 --> 1:20:50.294
Please know I really do
care about you.

1:20:50.388 --> 1:20:55.224
I don't know what you think
could possibly happen here

1:20:55.309 --> 1:20:57.476
after everything we've been
through together.

1:20:57.603 --> 1:21:00.470
This is the only way
that it ends.

1:21:00.565 --> 1:21:01.689
- Drop the knife!
- Wait!

1:21:01.774 --> 1:21:03.274
- I said drop it!
- She needs help.

1:21:03.359 --> 1:21:05.475
- Yeah, no kidding. Move aside!
- Wait!

1:21:05.570 --> 1:21:07.903
Wendy, I...

1:21:07.989 --> 1:21:09.864
Please, I saved you once.

1:21:09.949 --> 1:21:11.532
Let me save you again.

1:21:14.912 --> 1:21:16.820
Just...

1:21:16.914 --> 1:21:18.455
put the knife down.

1:21:18.541 --> 1:21:20.541
DETECTIVE KESSLER:
Put it down.

1:21:22.461 --> 1:21:24.003
JODI: Drop it.

1:21:27.633 --> 1:21:29.258
[knife clatters]

1:21:33.472 --> 1:21:35.014
- Don't move.
- It's all gonna be okay now.

1:21:35.141 --> 1:21:37.766
Put your hands
behind your back.

1:21:37.852 --> 1:21:39.009
[handcuffs click]

1:21:39.103 --> 1:21:42.438
I guess I owe you one
again, huh?

1:21:43.941 --> 1:21:45.524
DETECTIVE KESSLER: Let's go.

1:21:52.283 --> 1:21:55.200
Gotta say...
job well done, Jodi.

1:21:55.328 --> 1:21:56.911
Appreciate it.

1:21:56.996 --> 1:21:58.862
And I agree.

1:21:58.956 --> 1:22:02.199
Well, now that this project
is finally over,

1:22:02.293 --> 1:22:05.711
I guess we can start
working on a new one.

1:22:05.838 --> 1:22:07.463
Sounds good.

1:22:09.216 --> 1:22:13.093
Not to ruin the mood, but have
you heard anything about Wendy?

1:22:13.179 --> 1:22:15.638
Yeah, I spoke to Dr. Farber
last week.

1:22:15.723 --> 1:22:18.548
She said that she's finally
getting the help she needs

1:22:18.643 --> 1:22:21.393
from the doctors
at the institution.

1:22:22.647 --> 1:22:24.554
I just thank God
you called that detective

1:22:24.649 --> 1:22:26.857
and had her drop by
just in case.

1:22:29.695 --> 1:22:31.228
Thank you.

1:22:31.322 --> 1:22:32.821
For what?

1:22:32.907 --> 1:22:35.065
Where do I begin?

1:22:35.159 --> 1:22:37.076
If it wasn't for you,

1:22:37.203 --> 1:22:39.244
the first real warning
I had about Wendy,

1:22:39.372 --> 1:22:40.737
who knows?

1:22:40.831 --> 1:22:44.074
I may not have even looked
into her in the first place.

1:22:44.168 --> 1:22:47.211
Yeah, I guess that's right.

1:22:47.296 --> 1:22:51.298
In a way,
you kinda saved my life.

1:22:51.384 --> 1:22:53.750
How am I gonna repay you?

1:22:53.844 --> 1:22:56.804
Uh, why don't we just
leave it at "thanks."

1:22:56.889 --> 1:22:58.555
That's a good idea.

1:22:58.641 --> 1:23:00.307
[laughs]

1:23:11.404 --> 1:23:12.778
Well, good morning.

1:23:12.905 --> 1:23:15.739
And how are we feeling today?

1:23:15.825 --> 1:23:18.367
I feel better.

1:23:18.452 --> 1:23:21.996
I'm just a little...
out of it.

1:23:22.081 --> 1:23:24.123
Yeah, that's the drugs
we're giving you.

1:23:24.250 --> 1:23:25.782
Don't worry, Wendy.

1:23:25.876 --> 1:23:30.170
We'll find the right combination
of medication and therapy

1:23:30.256 --> 1:23:32.789
to get you straight again.

1:23:32.883 --> 1:23:35.292
Thank you, Dr. Thomas,

1:23:35.386 --> 1:23:38.128
for everything
that you've done for me.

1:23:38.222 --> 1:23:40.681
- You're welcome.
- I mean it.

1:23:41.892 --> 1:23:43.517
You saved my life.

1:23:43.602 --> 1:23:45.635
I'm just doing my job.

1:23:45.730 --> 1:23:47.438
I know.

1:23:47.523 --> 1:23:50.899
I'm just telling you
how much it means to me.

1:23:52.778 --> 1:23:53.944
Okay, then.

1:24:00.369 --> 1:24:01.285
[door closes]

1:24:01.370 --> 1:24:03.787
[deep breath]

1:24:03.873 --> 1:24:05.914
I owe you one.
