01:39.766 --> 01:42.701
<i>I shall tell you of William Wallace.</i>

01:43.736 --> 01:47.137
<i>Historians from England</i>
<i>will say I am a liar,</i>

01:47.240 --> 01:51.301
<i>but history is written by those</i>
<i>who have hanged heroes.</i>

01:52.846 --> 01:55.906
<i>The king of Scotland</i>
<i>had died without a son,</i>

01:56.015 --> 01:57.642
<i>and the king of England,</i>

01:57.784 --> 02:01.311
<i>a cruel pagan known</i>
<i>as Edward the Longshanks,</i>

02:01.654 --> 02:04.487
<i>claimed the throne of Scotland</i>
<i>for himself.</i>

02:05.391 --> 02:07.484
<i>Scotland's nobles fought him</i>

02:07.994 --> 02:10.929
<i>and fought each other over the crown.</i>

02:11.865 --> 02:15.096
<i>So Longshanks invited them</i>
<i>to talks of truce,</i>

02:15.568 --> 02:18.366
<i>no weapons, one page only.</i>

02:22.976 --> 02:25.536
<i>Among the farmers of that shire</i>
<i>was Malcolm Wallace,</i>

02:25.645 --> 02:27.442
<i>a commoner with his own lands.</i>

02:27.547 --> 02:30.141
<i>He had two sons, John and William.</i>

02:37.657 --> 02:39.420
I told you to stay.

02:40.860 --> 02:42.987
Well, I finished my work.

02:43.096 --> 02:44.154
Where are we going?

02:44.264 --> 02:47.427
MacAndrews'. He was supposed to visit
when the gathering was over.

02:47.534 --> 02:49.661
-Can I come?
-No. Go home, boy.

02:49.769 --> 02:51.100
But I want to go.

02:51.204 --> 02:53.866
Go home, William,
or you'll feel the back of my hand.

02:53.973 --> 02:56.100
Go you home, William.

03:20.266 --> 03:21.733
MacAndrews!

03:26.706 --> 03:28.196
MacAndrews!

03:36.382 --> 03:38.009
Holy Jesus.

04:22.195 --> 04:24.993
-It's all right!
-William! William!

04:26.633 --> 04:29.124
William! William, it's all right.

04:29.235 --> 04:31.601
It's all right. Easy, lad.

04:47.887 --> 04:49.115
William.

04:51.357 --> 04:54.155
And I say we hit back now!

04:54.260 --> 04:57.024
-We cannot fight them! It's suicide!
-Something's got to be done.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.826
Wallace is right! We fight them!

04:59.932 --> 05:02.628
Every nobleman who had a will to fight
was at that meeting.

05:02.735 --> 05:03.929
We cannot beat an army.

05:04.037 --> 05:05.732
Not with 50 farmers.

05:05.838 --> 05:09.035
We do not have to beat them,
just fight them.

05:09.876 --> 05:11.605
Now, who's with me?

05:11.711 --> 05:13.611
I am, Wallace.

05:14.314 --> 05:15.576
All right, all right.

05:15.682 --> 05:16.808
Ready.

05:31.764 --> 05:33.095
Where do you think you're going?

05:33.199 --> 05:34.564
I'm going with you.

05:34.667 --> 05:36.862
You're going with me, are you?

05:36.969 --> 05:40.268
-And what are you going to do?
-I'm gonna help.

05:40.373 --> 05:42.603
And a good help you'd be, too,

05:43.443 --> 05:47.539
but I need you to stay here
and look after the place for me

05:47.647 --> 05:49.046
while I'm away.

05:51.184 --> 05:52.674
I can fight.

05:55.555 --> 05:58.649
I know. I know you can fight.

06:04.130 --> 06:06.690
But it's our wits that make us men.

06:11.571 --> 06:13.198
See you tomorrow.

06:44.303 --> 06:45.998
-English.
-Get down.

06:47.273 --> 06:51.175
With your father and brother gone,
they'll kill us and burn the farm.

06:52.111 --> 06:53.669
It's up to us, Hamish.

07:12.031 --> 07:13.157
Nah.

07:58.945 --> 08:00.412
Da?

08:06.919 --> 08:07.908
Da?

09:20.860 --> 09:22.191
William.

09:25.765 --> 09:27.323
Come here, lad.

10:57.590 --> 10:58.818
Amen.

10:59.392 --> 11:00.620
-Amen.
-Amen.

12:54.106 --> 12:55.368
William.

12:57.309 --> 12:59.834
I'm your uncle. Argyle.

13:13.025 --> 13:15.425
You have the look of your mother.

13:26.806 --> 13:28.467
We'll stay here tonight.

13:28.574 --> 13:30.906
Tomorrow you'll come home with me.

13:31.010 --> 13:32.875
I don't want to leave.

13:33.946 --> 13:37.245
You didn't want your father to die either,
did you?

13:37.349 --> 13:38.941
But it happened.

13:42.755 --> 13:45.485
Did the priest give a poetic benediction?

13:46.358 --> 13:47.825
''The Lord bless thee and keep thee''?

13:47.927 --> 13:49.758
It was in Latin.

13:49.862 --> 13:51.420
You don't speak Latin?

13:53.365 --> 13:56.596
Well, that's something
we shall have to remedy, isn't it?

13:59.939 --> 14:02.669
The Lord bless thee and keep thee.

14:04.109 --> 14:07.442
The Lord cause his light
to shine on thee.

14:07.546 --> 14:10.709
The Lord lift up
his countenance upon thee

14:10.816 --> 14:12.875
and give thee peace.

14:13.619 --> 14:15.246
Amen.

14:21.627 --> 14:23.356
Your heart is free.

14:25.197 --> 14:27.427
Have the courage to follow it.

14:54.860 --> 14:56.885
What are they doing?

14:56.996 --> 15:00.193
Saying goodbye in their own way.

15:00.299 --> 15:03.757
Playing outlawed tunes
on outlawed pipes.

15:14.079 --> 15:18.106
It was the same for me and your daddy
when our father was killed.

15:45.644 --> 15:50.172
First, learn to use this.

15:51.650 --> 15:56.087
Then I'll teach you to use this.

16:26.618 --> 16:28.051
<i>Many years later,</i>

16:28.153 --> 16:31.088
<i>Edward the Longshanks,</i>
<i>King of England,</i>

16:31.190 --> 16:33.920
<i>supervised the wedding</i>
<i>of his eldest son,</i>

16:34.026 --> 16:36.586
<i>who would succeed him to the throne.</i>

16:39.331 --> 16:40.628
Amen.

16:45.137 --> 16:46.968
<i>As bride for his son,</i>

16:47.072 --> 16:50.439
<i>Longshanks had chosen the daughter</i>
<i>of his rival,</i>

16:50.542 --> 16:52.305
<i>the King of France.</i>

17:16.101 --> 17:19.627
<i>It was widely whispered</i>
<i>that for the princess to conceive,</i>

17:19.738 --> 17:22.798
<i>Longshanks would have to do</i>
<i>the honors himself.</i>

17:23.642 --> 17:26.805
<i>That may have been</i>
<i>what he had in mind all along.</i>

17:30.883 --> 17:34.842
Scotland. My land.

17:37.322 --> 17:41.486
The French will grovel
to anyone with strength,

17:42.294 --> 17:44.592
but how will they believe our strength

17:44.696 --> 17:47.790
when we cannot rule
the whole of our own island?

17:58.610 --> 18:00.271
Where is my son?

18:00.379 --> 18:03.906
Your pardon, milord.
He asked me to come in his stead.

18:04.716 --> 18:06.775
I sent for him, and he sends you.

18:07.719 --> 18:09.584
Shall I leave, milord?

18:11.023 --> 18:14.390
If he wants his queen
to rule when I am gone,

18:14.493 --> 18:17.519
then, by all means, stay and learn how.

18:17.863 --> 18:19.091
Please.

18:23.402 --> 18:24.596
Nobles.

18:25.337 --> 18:28.670
Nobles are the key
to the door of Scotland.

18:29.308 --> 18:32.436
Grant our nobles lands in the north,

18:32.544 --> 18:36.378
give their nobles
estates here in England,

18:36.482 --> 18:38.780
and make them too greedy
to oppose us.

18:38.884 --> 18:41.944
But, sire,
our nobles will be reluctant to uproot.

18:42.054 --> 18:44.386
New lands mean new taxes,

18:44.490 --> 18:46.481
and they're already taxed
for the war in France.

18:46.592 --> 18:47.889
Are they?

18:49.428 --> 18:50.725
Are they?

19:09.581 --> 19:13.915
The trouble with Scotland
is that it's full of Scots.

19:18.490 --> 19:23.189
Perhaps the time has come
to reinstitute an old custom.

19:24.062 --> 19:26.929
Grant them <i>prima nocte.</i>

19:29.568 --> 19:30.967
First night.

19:31.336 --> 19:34.897
When any common girl inhabiting
their lands is married,

19:35.007 --> 19:41.310
our nobles shall have sexual rights
to her on the night of her wedding.

19:43.115 --> 19:47.950
If we can't get them out,
we'll breed them out.

19:49.121 --> 19:53.387
That should fetch just the kind of lords
we want to Scotland,

19:53.492 --> 19:55.255
taxes or no taxes.

19:55.761 --> 19:59.322
-A most excellent idea, sire.
-Is it?

20:04.403 --> 20:08.533
<i>Now in Edinburgh were gathered</i>
<i>the council of Scottish nobles.</i>

20:09.141 --> 20:13.043
<i>Among these was Robert,</i>
<i>the 17th Earl of Bruce,</i>

20:13.779 --> 20:16.907
<i>a leading contender for the crown</i>
<i>of Scotland.</i>

20:23.155 --> 20:26.556
I hear that Longshanks
has granted <i>prima nocte.</i>

20:27.492 --> 20:30.723
Clearly meant to draw more
of his supporters here.

20:31.496 --> 20:36.058
My father believes that we must
lull Longshanks into our confidence

20:36.168 --> 20:38.136
by neither supporting his decree
nor opposing it.

20:38.237 --> 20:39.795
A wise plan.

20:39.905 --> 20:42.066
And how is your father?
We missed him at the council.

20:42.174 --> 20:45.007
His affairs in France
keep him long overdue.

20:50.182 --> 20:52.377
But he sends his greetings,

20:52.484 --> 20:56.420
and he says that I speak
for all of the Bruces and for Scotland.

23:07.119 --> 23:09.519
It's all over now.

23:09.621 --> 23:11.521
You've dropped your rock.

23:11.623 --> 23:13.056
Test of manhood.

23:15.160 --> 23:16.388
You win.

23:18.397 --> 23:20.729
Call it a test of soldiery, then.

23:20.832 --> 23:23.232
The English won't let us train
with weapons,

23:23.335 --> 23:24.700
so we train with stones.

23:24.803 --> 23:28.637
The test of a soldier is not in his arm.
It's here.

23:28.740 --> 23:30.708
No. It's here.

23:37.716 --> 23:38.910
Hamish?

23:52.998 --> 23:54.022
Here you go, Son.

23:54.132 --> 23:55.121
Show him how.

23:55.233 --> 23:56.530
Come on, Hamish!

23:58.370 --> 23:59.997
You'll never beat Hamish.

24:00.105 --> 24:02.096
Come on there, boy!

24:13.418 --> 24:14.407
My boy!

24:14.519 --> 24:16.646
That's a good throw.

24:16.755 --> 24:18.382
Aye. Aye, it was.

24:19.224 --> 24:22.625
I was wondering if you could do that
when it matters.

24:25.263 --> 24:27.254
As it matters in battle.

24:29.367 --> 24:31.801
Could you crush a man with that throw?

24:31.903 --> 24:34.394
I could crush you like a worm.

24:37.142 --> 24:38.973
-You could?
-Aye.

24:39.911 --> 24:40.935
Well, then, do it.

24:41.046 --> 24:42.809
Would you like to see him crush me
like a worm?

24:42.914 --> 24:43.881
Aye.

24:47.886 --> 24:49.615
-Come do it.
-You'll move.

24:49.721 --> 24:51.086
I will not.

24:51.857 --> 24:53.154
Right.

24:53.258 --> 24:54.282
He'll move.

24:54.392 --> 24:56.360
Come on, Hamish.

24:57.662 --> 24:59.425
Come on there, boy!

25:07.873 --> 25:09.204
Well done!

25:23.221 --> 25:25.246
Fine display, young Wallace.

25:25.357 --> 25:26.915
Are you all right?

25:27.025 --> 25:29.016
You look a wee bit shaky.

25:29.995 --> 25:33.192
-I should have remembered the rocks.
-Aye, you should have.

25:38.603 --> 25:40.867
Get up, you big heap.

25:40.972 --> 25:42.371
It's good to see you again.

25:42.474 --> 25:44.169
Aye. Welcome home.

25:46.478 --> 25:48.810
-Got my head.
-Well, you should have moved.

26:00.258 --> 26:02.692
William, will you dance with me?

26:04.095 --> 26:05.722
Of course I will.

26:30.956 --> 26:33.891
I've come to claim the right
of <i>prima nocte.</i>

26:34.759 --> 26:38.126
As lord of these lands,
I will bless this marriage

26:38.229 --> 26:43.223
by taking the bride into my bed
on the first night of her union.

26:43.335 --> 26:45.166
By God, you will not!

26:48.907 --> 26:50.966
It is my noble right.

28:52.764 --> 28:53.992
Good evening, sir.

28:54.099 --> 28:55.623
Young Wallace.

28:56.568 --> 28:59.969
-Grand soft evening, huh?
-Aye, it's that.

29:00.071 --> 29:03.700
I was wondering if I might have a word
with your daughter.

29:04.509 --> 29:06.773
What do you want
to have a word with her about?

29:06.878 --> 29:07.845
Well...

29:08.513 --> 29:12.609
Murron, would you like to come
and ride with me on this fine evening?

29:14.519 --> 29:17.113
In this? You're out of your mind.

29:17.222 --> 29:20.385
It's good Scottish weather, madam.
The rain is falling straight down.

29:20.492 --> 29:21.959
Slightly to the side, like.

29:22.060 --> 29:24.722
-She can't go with you.
-No?

29:24.829 --> 29:27.093
No the now, anyway.

29:27.198 --> 29:29.166
-No the now.
-No the now?

29:29.267 --> 29:30.325
We'll see you later.

29:30.435 --> 29:32.460
The weather's just fine.
It's hardly raining.

29:32.570 --> 29:34.902
Did you not hear what I said?

29:35.006 --> 29:37.702
-Murron!
-Murron! Get...

29:40.278 --> 29:41.643
It's you she takes after.

30:11.910 --> 30:13.901
How did you know me after so long?

30:14.012 --> 30:15.445
I didn't.

30:15.647 --> 30:18.878
It's just... I saw you staring at me,
and I didn't know who you were.

30:18.983 --> 30:21.076
I'm sorry. I suppose I was.

30:23.888 --> 30:26.857
Are you in the habit of riding off
in the rain with strangers?

30:26.958 --> 30:30.257
It was the best way to make you leave.

30:32.430 --> 30:35.160
If I can ever work up the courage
to ask you again,

30:35.266 --> 30:36.665
I'll send you a written warning first.

30:36.768 --> 30:38.736
That wouldn't do you much good.
I can't read.

30:38.837 --> 30:40.828
-Can you not?
-No.

30:43.741 --> 30:46.301
Well, that's something
we shall have to remedy, isn't it?

30:46.411 --> 30:49.141
-You're going to teach me to read, then?
-lf you like.

30:49.347 --> 30:52.009
-Aye.
-In what language?

30:53.818 --> 30:55.217
You're showing off now.

30:55.320 --> 30:58.289
-That's right. Are you impressed yet?
-No. Why? Should I be?

31:06.865 --> 31:10.130
Do that standing on your head,
and I'll be impressed.

31:10.501 --> 31:12.492
My kilt will fly up, but I'll try it.

31:12.604 --> 31:14.868
God, you certainly didn't learn
any manners on your travels.

31:14.973 --> 31:17.703
The French and the Romans
have far worse manners than I.

31:17.809 --> 31:20.972
-You've been to Rome?
-Aye, Argyle took me on a pilgrimage.

31:21.079 --> 31:22.740
What was it like?

31:27.919 --> 31:30.046
What does that mean?

31:30.154 --> 31:31.485
Beautiful.

31:34.826 --> 31:36.487
But I belong here.

32:09.627 --> 32:11.595
Murron? Come in now.

33:23.001 --> 33:26.232
Sir, I know it was strange of me
to invite Murron to ride last night,

33:26.337 --> 33:27.304
but I assure you...

33:27.405 --> 33:30.169
MacClannough's daughter
is another matter.

33:30.274 --> 33:32.936
I've come to fetch you to our meeting.

33:33.711 --> 33:36.043
-What kind of meeting?
-The secret kind.

33:36.147 --> 33:39.048
Your meetings are a waste of time,
Campbell.

33:40.752 --> 33:44.153
Your father was a fighter and a patriot.

33:47.058 --> 33:49.083
I know who my father was.

33:50.395 --> 33:54.161
I came back home to raise crops
and, God willing, a family.

33:55.900 --> 33:58.596
-lf I can live in peace, I will.
-Go on.

33:58.703 --> 34:00.637
You say you want to stay out
of the troubles?

34:00.872 --> 34:01.839
Aye.

34:01.939 --> 34:04.499
If you can prove it,
you may court my daughter.

34:04.609 --> 34:07.043
Until you prove it, my answer's no.

34:07.145 --> 34:08.304
No?

34:08.413 --> 34:10.005
No, Wallace. No.

34:10.481 --> 34:12.779
-Didn't I just prove it?
-No!

34:12.884 --> 34:14.681
-No?
-No!

34:56.793 --> 34:59.888
Of course,
running a farm's a lot of work,

34:59.997 --> 35:02.932
but that will all change
when my sons arrive.

35:04.102 --> 35:06.036
So you've got children?

35:06.137 --> 35:09.834
Not yet, but I was hoping
that you could help me with that.

35:10.741 --> 35:11.943
So you want me to marry you, then?

35:11.943 --> 35:12.466
So you want me to marry you, then?

35:12.577 --> 35:14.909
It's a bit sudden, but all right.

35:15.012 --> 35:17.412
Is that what you call a proposal?

35:18.549 --> 35:21.279
I love you. Always have.

35:23.654 --> 35:25.383
I want to marry you.

35:37.635 --> 35:39.034
Is that a yes?

35:39.137 --> 35:41.264
-Aye, that's a yes.
-It is?

36:24.315 --> 36:26.340
We best hurry. He'll be waiting.

36:26.450 --> 36:28.577
-Wait.
-Where are you going?

36:34.959 --> 36:36.984
-What's that?
-You'll see.

36:55.980 --> 36:57.379
Father.

37:10.161 --> 37:12.425
I will love you my whole life,

37:13.731 --> 37:15.392
you and no other.

37:20.838 --> 37:22.169
And I you,

37:23.107 --> 37:25.132
you and no other, forever.

40:53.851 --> 40:55.375
When am I going to see you again?

40:55.486 --> 40:56.919
Tonight?

40:57.021 --> 40:59.046
-I can't.
-Why not?

40:59.156 --> 41:00.248
My dad's growing suspicious.

41:00.357 --> 41:01.483
Growing suspicious, is he?

41:01.592 --> 41:03.321
Wouldn't have anything to do with that,
would it?

41:03.427 --> 41:05.122
When? When? When?

41:06.864 --> 41:08.695
-When?
-Tonight.

41:08.799 --> 41:10.960
-Tonight.
-Tonight.

41:18.108 --> 41:20.042
Look lively, Sergeant.

41:31.388 --> 41:33.083
Where are you going, lassie?

41:33.190 --> 41:34.282
That looks heavy.

41:34.391 --> 41:36.655
-Let me help you with it.
-No. It's fine.

41:36.760 --> 41:39.160
I'm not going to steal it.

41:41.565 --> 41:44.466
You remind me
of my daughter back home.

41:57.281 --> 41:58.578
Hello, lassie.

42:13.397 --> 42:15.297
No! No!

42:18.168 --> 42:20.534
Keep it quiet, Smythe.

42:24.008 --> 42:25.669
You bitch!

42:32.983 --> 42:34.507
You bitch!

42:43.127 --> 42:44.219
Are you all right?

42:44.328 --> 42:46.193
All right? Come on.

42:48.699 --> 42:49.859
-Are you all right?
-Aye.

42:49.967 --> 42:51.628
Are you all right?

43:00.811 --> 43:02.540
-Can you ride?
-Aye.

43:07.351 --> 43:10.047
Come back here, you bastard!

43:10.888 --> 43:12.287
Raise the alarm!

43:12.389 --> 43:13.754
Help!

43:14.391 --> 43:16.518
Meet me at the grove. Ride!

43:16.994 --> 43:18.894
They're getting away!

43:24.768 --> 43:26.736
Go round back!

43:43.354 --> 43:44.616
Get her!

43:45.489 --> 43:47.855
Come on!

44:02.606 --> 44:03.573
You bitch!

44:26.664 --> 44:28.131
Murron?

44:35.506 --> 44:36.973
Murron!

44:45.549 --> 44:48.074
All of you know full well

44:48.185 --> 44:50.585
the great pains I've always taken

44:51.422 --> 44:55.984
never to be too strict, too rigid
with the application of our laws.

44:56.894 --> 44:58.885
And as a consequence,

44:58.996 --> 45:02.159
have we not learned to live together

45:02.266 --> 45:04.496
in relative peace and harmony?

45:10.441 --> 45:15.970
And this day's lawlessness
is how you repay my leniency!

45:25.355 --> 45:27.755
Well, you leave me with little choice.

45:35.632 --> 45:38.066
An assault on the king's soldiers

45:39.436 --> 45:42.462
is the same as an assault
on the king himself.

45:58.822 --> 46:00.722
Now,

46:00.824 --> 46:03.452
let this scrapper come to me.

46:49.840 --> 46:50.898
Sir!

46:59.449 --> 47:00.677
There.

50:27.357 --> 50:28.551
Corporal.

50:28.658 --> 50:30.990
Some archers on the tower. Now!

50:40.804 --> 50:42.567
Hold still, Father.

50:43.707 --> 50:45.265
You're an idiot, boy!

52:09.359 --> 52:11.122
Father, you all right?

53:34.311 --> 53:35.676
MacAulish.

53:38.081 --> 53:39.605
MacAulish.

53:41.885 --> 53:43.250
MacAulish!

53:44.387 --> 53:47.379
MacAulish! MacAulish!

53:48.091 --> 53:52.084
-MacAulish! MacAulish!
-Wallace! Wallace!

53:52.195 --> 53:54.322
Wallace! Wallace!

53:54.431 --> 53:57.696
Wallace! Wallace! Wallace!

53:57.801 --> 54:00.964
Wallace! Wallace! Wallace!

56:16.573 --> 56:18.598
What you waiting for, boy?

56:19.909 --> 56:22.673
Here. You can do it. I'll hold him down.

56:24.714 --> 56:26.511
Here. You can do it.

56:27.250 --> 56:28.084
I'll hold him down.

56:28.084 --> 56:28.641
I'll hold him down.

56:28.752 --> 56:30.413
Pour it straight in the wound, boy.

56:30.520 --> 56:32.579
I know it seems like a waste
of good whiskey.

56:32.689 --> 56:34.088
Indulge me.

56:37.794 --> 56:39.125
Hold him. Hold him.

56:39.229 --> 56:42.096
Hold him. Now let him go.

56:43.299 --> 56:45.164
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

56:48.972 --> 56:51.736
That'll wake you up in the morning, boy.

56:51.841 --> 56:53.433
There's somebody coming!

56:53.543 --> 56:55.306
Arm yourselves!

57:01.151 --> 57:03.142
There's somebody coming.

57:04.087 --> 57:06.453
MacGregors, from the next glen.

57:12.228 --> 57:14.719
We heard about what was happening.

57:14.831 --> 57:18.426
We don't want you <i>amadans</i> thinking
you can have your fun without us.

57:18.535 --> 57:19.900
-That's right.
-Aye.

57:20.770 --> 57:22.032
Go home.

57:23.173 --> 57:25.107
Some of us are in this.

57:25.842 --> 57:27.742
Can't help that now.

57:28.445 --> 57:31.414
But you can help yourselves. Go home.

57:31.514 --> 57:34.210
We'll have no homes left when
the English garrison from the castle

57:34.317 --> 57:37.047
comes through and burns us out.

57:37.153 --> 57:39.621
-And they will.
-Aye.

57:41.691 --> 57:43.022
Welcome.

58:13.156 --> 58:15.124
Patrol returning, milord!

58:42.919 --> 58:44.648
So what news?

58:56.466 --> 58:59.196
I have dispatched
100 soldiers to Lanark.

58:59.536 --> 59:01.527
They will be returning now!

59:01.638 --> 59:04.072
Were they dressed like this?

59:04.908 --> 59:07.433
Actually, it was more like 50.

59:07.544 --> 59:09.011
Make it quick.

59:11.814 --> 59:13.406
You remember me?

59:14.918 --> 59:17.250
I never did her any harm.
It was my right.

59:17.353 --> 59:18.377
Your right?

59:18.488 --> 59:21.252
Well, I'm here to claim the right
of a husband!

59:28.331 --> 59:30.299
I am William Wallace,

59:32.569 --> 59:35.367
and the rest of you will be spared.

59:35.471 --> 59:38.201
Go back to England and tell them there

59:39.075 --> 59:42.636
that Scotland's daughters
and her sons are yours no more.

59:44.847 --> 59:47.315
Tell them Scotland is free.

59:53.156 --> 59:54.646
Burn it.

01:00:08.972 --> 01:00:10.166
Good job, milord.

01:00:28.491 --> 01:00:32.985
Scottish rebels have routed
one of my garrisons

01:00:33.096 --> 01:00:35.326
and murdered the noble lord.

01:00:35.431 --> 01:00:36.864
I heard.

01:00:36.966 --> 01:00:39.662
This Wallace is a brigand,
nothing more.

01:00:40.236 --> 01:00:42.864
And how would you deal
with this brigand?

01:00:42.972 --> 01:00:44.371
Like any common thief.

01:00:44.474 --> 01:00:48.205
Have the local magistrate arrest him
and punish him accordingly.

01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:52.077
Leave us.

01:01:03.126 --> 01:01:05.856
Wallace has already killed
the magistrate

01:01:05.962 --> 01:01:08.089
and taken control of the town.

01:01:08.898 --> 01:01:10.490
Stand up.

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:11.897
Stand up.

01:01:12.869 --> 01:01:14.700
In the morning,

01:01:15.838 --> 01:01:18.864
I depart for France
to press our rights there,

01:01:18.975 --> 01:01:22.240
and I leave you here
to quell this little rebellion.

01:01:22.345 --> 01:01:24.006
Understood? Is it?

01:01:28.351 --> 01:01:30.512
One day, you will be a king,

01:01:32.288 --> 01:01:34.518
at least try to act like one.

01:01:38.394 --> 01:01:40.021
Get away from me!

01:01:40.763 --> 01:01:42.924
Convene my military council.

01:02:24.373 --> 01:02:25.772
There!

01:02:28.511 --> 01:02:29.876
After them.

01:02:57.173 --> 01:02:58.333
No point resisting.

01:02:58.441 --> 01:03:00.306
You're outnumbered and trapped.

01:03:00.409 --> 01:03:03.503
Now, where are the rest of you?
Where's Wallace?

01:03:15.725 --> 01:03:16.987
Father?

01:03:17.093 --> 01:03:19.061
Come in. Come in.

01:03:19.862 --> 01:03:21.921
A rebellion has begun.

01:03:28.638 --> 01:03:29.935
Under whom?

01:03:30.039 --> 01:03:33.133
A commoner named William Wallace.

01:03:44.086 --> 01:03:46.520
You will embrace this rebellion.

01:03:46.923 --> 01:03:49.721
Support it from our lands in the north.

01:03:50.293 --> 01:03:52.386
I will gain English favor

01:03:52.495 --> 01:03:57.455
by condemning it and ordering it
opposed from our lands in the south.

01:03:59.302 --> 01:04:01.361
Sit down. Stay awhile.

01:04:08.845 --> 01:04:10.403
This Wallace,

01:04:12.248 --> 01:04:16.412
he doesn't even have a knighthood,
but he fights with passion,

01:04:16.519 --> 01:04:18.077
and he inspires.

01:04:18.754 --> 01:04:21.746
And you wish to charge off
and fight as he did?

01:04:23.159 --> 01:04:24.751
So would I.

01:04:24.927 --> 01:04:26.360
Well, maybe it's time.

01:04:26.462 --> 01:04:29.397
It is time to survive.

01:04:30.233 --> 01:04:32.463
You're the 17th Robert Bruce.

01:04:33.102 --> 01:04:38.904
The 16 before you passed you land
and title because they didn't charge in.

01:04:40.910 --> 01:04:43.743
-Call a meeting of the nobles.
-They do nothing but talk.

01:04:43.846 --> 01:04:44.972
Rightly so.

01:04:45.081 --> 01:04:47.948
They're as rich in English titles
and lands as they are in Scottish.

01:04:48.050 --> 01:04:49.483
Just as we are.

01:04:49.585 --> 01:04:52.554
You admire this man,
this William Wallace.

01:04:52.655 --> 01:04:55.249
Uncompromising men
are easy to admire.

01:04:55.758 --> 01:04:58.090
He has courage, so does a dog.

01:04:58.194 --> 01:05:01.220
But it is exactly
the ability to compromise

01:05:01.330 --> 01:05:03.298
that makes a man noble.

01:05:03.966 --> 01:05:05.558
And understand this,

01:05:05.668 --> 01:05:08.228
Edward Longshanks
is the most ruthless king

01:05:08.337 --> 01:05:11.033
ever to sit on the throne of England,

01:05:11.140 --> 01:05:17.636
and none of us and nothing of Scotland
will remain unless we are as ruthless.

01:05:19.315 --> 01:05:21.249
Give ear to our nobles.

01:05:22.318 --> 01:05:26.721
Knowing their minds
is the key to the throne.

01:05:43.205 --> 01:05:46.038
Wait. Wait. Look.

01:05:46.809 --> 01:05:49.107
-This is out, and this is left.
-Of course.

01:05:49.211 --> 01:05:50.473
Carry on.

01:05:50.579 --> 01:05:52.046
Carry on!

01:07:34.583 --> 01:07:35.845
You know,

01:07:35.951 --> 01:07:39.079
eventually, Longshanks will send
his whole northern army against us.

01:07:39.188 --> 01:07:41.486
Heavy cavalry, armored horse.

01:07:42.024 --> 01:07:43.889
Shake the very ground.

01:07:45.027 --> 01:07:46.619
They'll ride right over us.

01:07:46.729 --> 01:07:49.254
Uncle Argyle used to talk about it,

01:07:49.365 --> 01:07:52.732
how no army had ever stood up
to a charge of heavy horse.

01:07:52.835 --> 01:07:56.430
-So what do we do?
-Hit, run, hide, the Highland way.

01:08:04.647 --> 01:08:06.171
We'll make spears.

01:08:07.450 --> 01:08:08.849
Hundreds of them.

01:08:08.951 --> 01:08:11.852
Long spears, twice as long as a man.

01:08:11.954 --> 01:08:13.979
-That long?
-Aye.

01:08:15.324 --> 01:08:17.189
Some men are longer than others.

01:08:17.292 --> 01:08:20.626
Your mother been telling you stories
about me again.

01:08:22.198 --> 01:08:24.428
Volunteers coming in!

01:08:27.236 --> 01:08:28.760
William Wallace,

01:08:28.871 --> 01:08:31.339
we've come to fight and to die for you.

01:08:31.439 --> 01:08:34.203
Stand up, man. I'm not the Pope.

01:08:34.310 --> 01:08:37.176
My name is Faudron. My sword is yours.

01:08:37.279 --> 01:08:38.303
I brought you this.

01:08:38.413 --> 01:08:40.404
We checked them for arms.

01:08:41.484 --> 01:08:43.179
I brought you this.

01:08:43.652 --> 01:08:46.348
-My wife made it for you.
-Thank you.

01:08:51.227 --> 01:08:53.718
Him? That can't be William Wallace.

01:08:53.828 --> 01:08:56.024
I'm prettier than this man.

01:08:59.301 --> 01:09:01.667
All right, Father. I'll ask him.

01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:09.941
If I risk my neck for you,
will I get a chance to kill Englishmen?

01:09:10.045 --> 01:09:13.537
Is your father a ghost,
or do you converse with the Almighty?

01:09:13.649 --> 01:09:16.812
In order to find his equal,
an Irishman is forced to talk to God.

01:09:16.919 --> 01:09:17.908
Yes, Father?

01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:20.113
The Almighty says
don't change the subject,

01:09:20.221 --> 01:09:21.746
just answer the fucking question.

01:09:21.857 --> 01:09:22.823
Mind your tongue.

01:09:22.925 --> 01:09:24.392
Insane Irish.

01:09:28.596 --> 01:09:32.225
Smart enough to get a dagger
past your guards, old man.

01:09:33.068 --> 01:09:35.161
That's my friend, Irishman,

01:09:35.270 --> 01:09:37.296
and the answer to your question is yes.

01:09:37.406 --> 01:09:40.307
You fight for me,
you get to kill the English.

01:09:40.408 --> 01:09:41.966
Excellent!

01:09:42.077 --> 01:09:44.170
Stephen is my name.

01:09:44.279 --> 01:09:49.479
I'm the most wanted man on my island,
except I'm not on my island, of course.

01:09:49.585 --> 01:09:50.984
More's the pity.

01:09:51.086 --> 01:09:53.281
Your island? You mean Ireland?

01:09:53.389 --> 01:09:54.947
Yeah. It's mine.

01:09:59.595 --> 01:10:01.222
You're a madman.

01:10:08.470 --> 01:10:10.961
I've come to the right place, then.

01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:34.578
Sure didn't the Almighty
send me to watch your back?

01:11:36.158 --> 01:11:38.217
I didn't like him anyway.

01:11:40.429 --> 01:11:42.590
He wasn't right in the head.

01:11:56.078 --> 01:11:57.170
William!

01:11:57.279 --> 01:11:59.076
It's several runners!

01:12:10.059 --> 01:12:13.722
The English are advancing
an army toward Stirling.

01:12:13.829 --> 01:12:14.955
Do the nobles rally?

01:12:15.064 --> 01:12:18.431
Robert the Bruce and most of the others
will not commit to battle,

01:12:18.534 --> 01:12:19.865
but word has spread,

01:12:19.968 --> 01:12:21.799
and the Highlanders
are coming down on their own.

01:12:21.904 --> 01:12:25.203
Aye, in droves of hundreds
and thousands.

01:12:25.808 --> 01:12:27.935
Are you ready for a war?

01:12:43.392 --> 01:12:45.019
-Well, what news?
-We're outnumbered,

01:12:45.127 --> 01:12:46.287
at least three to one.

01:12:46.395 --> 01:12:48.863
-How many horse, then?
-Three hundred. Maybe more.

01:12:48.964 --> 01:12:50.329
Three hundred heavy horse?

01:12:50.432 --> 01:12:53.765
-We must try to negotiate.
-Well, who is in command?

01:12:53.869 --> 01:12:57.430
-Did he have a scarlet chevron?
-Aye, he did.

01:12:59.007 --> 01:13:00.907
We can still negotiate.

01:13:04.313 --> 01:13:06.611
What are they talking about?

01:13:06.715 --> 01:13:09.411
I can't hear, but it doesn't look good.

01:13:09.518 --> 01:13:11.452
The nobles will negotiate.

01:13:11.553 --> 01:13:13.953
They'll do a deal, then we go home.

01:13:14.990 --> 01:13:17.015
If not, we charge.

01:13:17.126 --> 01:13:19.959
Three hundred heavy horse,
we've no chance.

01:14:19.588 --> 01:14:20.987
So many.

01:14:25.861 --> 01:14:28.694
I didn't come here to fight
so they could own more lands.

01:14:28.797 --> 01:14:31.197
Then I'll have to work for them.

01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:32.426
Nor me.

01:14:33.802 --> 01:14:37.863
All right, lads!
I'm not dying for these bastards.

01:14:37.973 --> 01:14:39.531
Let's go home!

01:14:57.426 --> 01:15:00.793
Stop, men! Do not flee!

01:15:00.896 --> 01:15:03.387
Wait until we've negotiated!

01:15:56.885 --> 01:15:58.079
William Wallace.

01:15:58.186 --> 01:16:00.211
Can't be. Not tall enough.

01:16:21.209 --> 01:16:23.734
The Almighty says
this must be a fashionable fight.

01:16:23.845 --> 01:16:25.608
It's drawn the finest people.

01:16:25.714 --> 01:16:27.272
Where is thy salute?

01:16:27.382 --> 01:16:31.148
For presenting yourselves
on this battlefield, I give you thanks.

01:16:31.253 --> 01:16:32.777
This is our army.

01:16:32.888 --> 01:16:34.412
To join it, you give homage.

01:16:34.523 --> 01:16:36.923
I give homage to Scotland,

01:16:37.626 --> 01:16:39.753
and if this is your army

01:16:40.929 --> 01:16:42.453
why does it go?

01:16:42.564 --> 01:16:45.226
We didn't come here to fight for them!

01:16:48.637 --> 01:16:51.105
Home! The English are too many.

01:17:00.148 --> 01:17:01.911
Sons of Scotland,

01:17:03.118 --> 01:17:04.813
I am William Wallace.

01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:07.047
William Wallace is seven feet tall.

01:17:07.155 --> 01:17:09.123
Yes, I've heard.

01:17:09.224 --> 01:17:11.488
He kills men by the hundreds,

01:17:11.593 --> 01:17:14.221
and if he were here,
he'd consume the English

01:17:14.329 --> 01:17:18.834
with fireballs from his eyes
and bolts of lightning from his arse.

01:17:22.104 --> 01:17:23.935
I am William Wallace,

01:17:25.574 --> 01:17:29.601
and I see a whole army
of my countrymen

01:17:30.245 --> 01:17:32.406
here in defiance of tyranny.

01:17:35.851 --> 01:17:38.479
You've come to fight as free men.

01:17:40.489 --> 01:17:42.320
And free men you are.

01:17:45.494 --> 01:17:47.962
What will you do with that freedom?

01:17:50.132 --> 01:17:51.724
Will you fight?

01:17:51.833 --> 01:17:54.768
No! No! No!

01:17:54.870 --> 01:17:57.065
Fight? Against that? No!

01:17:57.506 --> 01:17:59.736
We will run, and we will live.

01:18:00.809 --> 01:18:02.037
Aye.

01:18:02.144 --> 01:18:04.169
Fight, and you may die.

01:18:04.279 --> 01:18:06.179
Run, and you'll live.

01:18:07.249 --> 01:18:08.944
At least awhile.

01:18:12.220 --> 01:18:15.587
And dying in your beds
many years from now,

01:18:16.792 --> 01:18:22.196
would you be willing to trade
all the days from this day to that

01:18:22.297 --> 01:18:28.099
for one chance, just one chance,
to come back here and tell our enemies

01:18:28.403 --> 01:18:30.633
that they may take our lives,

01:18:31.339 --> 01:18:34.570
but they'll never take our freedom?

01:19:01.903 --> 01:19:03.871
They seem quite optimistic to me.

01:19:03.972 --> 01:19:05.132
Maybe they do want to fight.

01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:08.801
Confrontation might be
a foregone conclusion, milord,

01:19:08.910 --> 01:19:12.038
but, nonetheless, I think
we should deliver the king's terms.

01:19:12.147 --> 01:19:15.344
The king's terms?
He'll never live up to them.

01:19:15.450 --> 01:19:16.940
Milord, I think...

01:19:17.052 --> 01:19:19.577
All right. Offer them the terms.

01:19:22.724 --> 01:19:24.919
They're coming out.
Shall we go and meet them?

01:19:25.026 --> 01:19:27.324
-Let me do the talking. Agreed?
-Agreed.

01:19:33.668 --> 01:19:35.727
Fine speech.

01:19:35.837 --> 01:19:37.532
Now what do we do?

01:19:39.274 --> 01:19:41.105
Just be yourselves.

01:19:41.710 --> 01:19:43.337
Where are you going?

01:19:43.445 --> 01:19:45.470
I'm going to pick a fight.

01:19:52.187 --> 01:19:55.452
Well, we didn't get dressed up
for nothing.

01:19:58.059 --> 01:20:00.050
Mornay, Lochlan, Craig.

01:20:05.100 --> 01:20:07.261
Here are the king's terms.

01:20:07.369 --> 01:20:10.497
Lead this army off the field,

01:20:14.676 --> 01:20:17.736
and he will give you each
estates in Yorkshire,

01:20:18.747 --> 01:20:21.045
including hereditary title,

01:20:21.149 --> 01:20:23.640
from which you will pay...

01:20:23.752 --> 01:20:25.811
From which you will pay him
an annual duty...

01:20:25.921 --> 01:20:27.354
I have an offer for you.

01:20:27.455 --> 01:20:29.923
Cheltham, this is William Wallace.

01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:33.992
From which you will pay the king
an annual duty...

01:20:34.095 --> 01:20:35.426
I said I have an offer for you.

01:20:35.530 --> 01:20:37.157
You disrespect a banner of truce?

01:20:37.265 --> 01:20:39.290
From his king? Absolutely.

01:20:40.502 --> 01:20:42.561
Here are Scotland's terms.

01:20:43.071 --> 01:20:46.529
Lower your flags
and march straight back to England,

01:20:46.641 --> 01:20:49.235
stopping at every home you pass by
to beg forgiveness

01:20:49.344 --> 01:20:52.177
for 100 years of theft, rape and murder.

01:20:52.881 --> 01:20:55.645
Do that and your men shall live.

01:20:55.750 --> 01:20:58.878
Do it not
and every one of you will die today.

01:21:06.027 --> 01:21:07.927
You are outmatched.

01:21:08.029 --> 01:21:09.826
You have no heavy cavalry.

01:21:09.931 --> 01:21:12.263
In two centuries, no army has won...

01:21:12.367 --> 01:21:13.959
I'm not finished!

01:21:16.271 --> 01:21:18.262
Before we let you leave,

01:21:18.773 --> 01:21:23.642
your commander must cross that field,
present himself before this army,

01:21:23.745 --> 01:21:25.770
put his head between his legs,

01:21:25.881 --> 01:21:27.746
and kiss his own arse.

01:21:38.360 --> 01:21:40.885
I'd say that was rather less cordial
than he was used to.

01:21:40.996 --> 01:21:43.260
You be ready and do exactly as I say.

01:21:43.365 --> 01:21:44.389
On my signal,

01:21:44.499 --> 01:21:47.525
ride round behind our position
and flank them.

01:21:47.636 --> 01:21:49.103
We must not divide our forces.

01:21:49.204 --> 01:21:52.037
Do it and let the English see you do it.

01:21:53.308 --> 01:21:55.469
They'll think we run away.

01:21:55.577 --> 01:21:58.341
Take out their archers.
I'll meet you in the middle.

01:21:58.446 --> 01:21:59.970
Right. Come on.

01:22:24.506 --> 01:22:26.303
Insolent bastard.

01:22:26.408 --> 01:22:29.241
I want this Wallace's heart on a plate.

01:22:29.344 --> 01:22:30.675
Archers.

01:22:30.779 --> 01:22:33.407
-Archers! Archers!
-Archers!

01:22:39.387 --> 01:22:43.084
-Archers, forward!
-Archers, forward!

01:23:39.047 --> 01:23:40.537
You bastards!

01:24:15.250 --> 01:24:16.512
Loose!

01:24:36.805 --> 01:24:39.365
The Lord tells me he can get me
out of this mess,

01:24:39.474 --> 01:24:41.965
but he's pretty sure you're fucked.

01:25:03.250 --> 01:25:04.740
-Ready!
-Loose!

01:25:22.636 --> 01:25:24.160
Ride!

01:25:28.575 --> 01:25:31.339
See, every Scot with a horse is fleeing.

01:25:31.445 --> 01:25:34.471
Our cavalry will ride them down
like grass.

01:25:34.581 --> 01:25:36.048
Send the horse.

01:25:36.149 --> 01:25:37.810
Full attack.

01:26:52.259 --> 01:26:53.920
Steady!

01:26:55.262 --> 01:26:56.729
Hold!

01:26:58.732 --> 01:27:00.256
Hold!

01:27:04.938 --> 01:27:05.962
Hold!

01:27:10.811 --> 01:27:12.005
Hold!

01:27:13.305 --> 01:27:19.240
