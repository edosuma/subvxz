WEBVTT

00:00.800 --> 00:01.767
PREVIOUSLY ON
"GREY'S ANATOMY"...

00:01.800 --> 00:03.767
I SLEPT WITH GEORGE.
IT WAS A HORRIBLE MISTAKE.

00:03.800 --> 00:05.833
I'M DONE. WE'RE DONE.

00:05.867 --> 00:07.567
PANCAKES?
(Cristina)
HE'S NOT MY ROOMMATE.

00:07.600 --> 00:09.833
THIS IS WHY I SHOULDN'T
HAVE GIVEN UP MY PLACE.
HE WOULD STILL BE

00:09.867 --> 00:11.667
OUR ROOMMATE IF MEREDITH
WOULD JUST APOLOGIZE.

00:11.700 --> 00:15.300
YOU KNOW, AT SOME POINT, YOU ARE
GOING TO HAVE TO TALK TO ME.

00:15.333 --> 00:17.467
(Callie) YOUR EX DID
A REAL NUMBER ON YOU, HUH?

00:17.500 --> 00:19.167
YOU DIDN'T CALL ME.

00:19.200 --> 00:20.367
I DID. I DID.
A FEW TIMES.

00:20.400 --> 00:22.267
I JUST HUNG UP
EVERY TIME.

00:22.300 --> 00:24.033
HOW IS SHE TODAY?
SHE'S GREAT.

00:24.067 --> 00:28.067
SHE REALLY LIGHTS UP
WHEN DR. WEBBER VISITS.

00:29.700 --> 00:31.733
DENNY, YOUR CONGESTIVE
HEART FAILURE IS GETTING WORSE

00:31.767 --> 00:33.467
DESPITE THE MEDS.

00:33.500 --> 00:35.800
WE NEED MORE TIME.

00:35.833 --> 00:40.233
***

00:40.267 --> 00:42.400
(Meredith) MY COLLEGE CAMPUS
HAS A MAGIC STATUE.

00:42.433 --> 00:44.533
***

00:44.567 --> 00:46.467
IT'S A LONG-STANDING TRADITION

00:46.500 --> 00:49.433
FOR STUDENTS TO RUB ITS NOSE
FOR GOOD LUCK.

00:49.467 --> 00:53.400
***

00:54.867 --> 00:57.500
MY FRESHMAN ROOMMATE REALLY
BELIEVED IN THE STATUE'S POWER

00:57.533 --> 00:58.700
AND INSISTED ON VISITING IT

00:58.733 --> 01:00.500
TO RUB
ITS NOSE BEFORE EVERY EXAM.

01:00.533 --> 01:04.067
***

01:06.333 --> 01:09.100
ARE YOU SURE MY SCRUB CAPS
AREN'T IN THE LAUNDRY DELIVERY?

01:09.133 --> 01:10.300
I TRIPLE CHECKED.

01:10.333 --> 01:11.833
YOU'RE SURE?
YEAH, I'M SURE.

01:11.867 --> 01:13.767
STUDYING MIGHT HAVE BEEN
A BETTER IDEA.

01:13.800 --> 01:17.300
SHE FLUNKED OUT
HER SOPHOMORE YEAR.

01:17.333 --> 01:18.633
(cracks neck)

01:18.667 --> 01:20.700
BUT THE FACT IS, WE ALL HAVE

01:20.733 --> 01:23.667
LITTLE SUPERSTITIOUS THINGS
THAT WE DO.

01:23.700 --> 01:25.367
OKAY, WELL,

01:25.400 --> 01:27.400
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL MORNING
TO SAVE LIVES, PEOPLE, OKAY?

01:27.433 --> 01:28.800
LET'S HAVE SOME FUN.

01:28.833 --> 01:31.567
IF IT'S NOT BELIEVING
IN MAGIC STATUES,

01:31.600 --> 01:33.100
IT'S AVOIDING SIDEWALK CRACKS

01:33.133 --> 01:36.100
OR ALWAYS PUTTING
OUR LEFT SHOE ON FIRST...

01:36.133 --> 01:39.667
***

01:39.700 --> 01:41.067
KNOCK ON WOOD...

01:41.067 --> 01:42.633
10 BLADE.

01:42.667 --> 01:46.433
STEP ON A CRACK,
BREAK YOUR MOTHER'S BACK.

01:46.467 --> 01:48.467
(monitor beeps rapidly)

01:48.500 --> 01:51.433
PADDLES.
(monitor beeps rapidly)

01:51.467 --> 01:53.333
10 JOULES.
(paddles discharge)

01:53.367 --> 01:55.600
HE'S HAVING A REACTION.
I NEED TO TAKE HIM OFF.

01:55.633 --> 01:57.200
I'M IN THE MIDDLE
OF HIS BRAIN.

01:57.233 --> 01:58.567
WE'RE LOSING HIM.

01:58.600 --> 02:02.767
(monitor emitting
continuous tone)

02:02.800 --> 02:07.367
***

02:09.100 --> 02:11.500
TIME OF DEATH...
TIME OF DEATH...

02:11.533 --> 02:12.600
TIME OF DEATH...

02:12.633 --> 02:14.633
CALL IT, GREY.

02:14.667 --> 02:16.567
THE LAST THING WE WANT TO DO
IS OFFEND THE GODS.

02:16.600 --> 02:18.233
TIME OF DEATH--8:17.

02:18.267 --> 02:20.300
(monitor emitting
continuous tone)

02:20.333 --> 02:22.233
***

02:22.267 --> 02:24.167
FOUR SURGERIES,
FOUR FATALITIES,

02:24.200 --> 02:26.433
AND THE DAY'S
BARELY STARTED.

02:26.467 --> 02:28.333
COULD I HAVE A BITE
OF THAT?
NO, YOU'RE IN MY APARTMENT.

02:28.367 --> 02:29.833
YOU DON'T GET TO BE
IN MY FOOD.

02:29.867 --> 02:31.767
DR. BURKE GAVE ME
A PROTEIN BAR THIS MORNING.

02:31.800 --> 02:34.467
BURKE PACKS HIS LUNCH FOR HIM.
DID I MENTION?

02:34.500 --> 02:36.467
(Izzie) TALKED TO
THE MORGUE GUY THIS MORNING.
THE ONE WITH THE UNIBROW?

02:36.500 --> 02:38.367
THE ONE WITH THE, LIKE,
TEETH THING.

02:38.400 --> 02:40.333
AND HE SAID
THAT SURGICAL FATALITIES

02:40.367 --> 02:41.667
COME IN THREES AND SEVENS.

02:41.700 --> 02:43.600
SAYS THERE'LL BE THREE MORE
BEFORE MIDNIGHT.
WELL, OKAY, THEN,

02:43.633 --> 02:45.467
SINCE DEAD TOOTH MORGUE GUY
SAID SO.

02:45.500 --> 02:46.833
HE'S THE MORGUE GUY.

02:46.867 --> 02:49.467
HE KNOWS THINGS ABOUT DEATH.

02:49.500 --> 02:51.367
YOU DROPPED THIS.

02:54.067 --> 02:55.567
HE'S STILL IGNORING ME.

02:55.600 --> 02:57.067
(Cristina)
IGNORE HIM BACK.

02:57.100 --> 02:59.833
DEREK SAYS I SHOULD APOLOGIZE
UNTIL HE LISTENS.

02:59.867 --> 03:01.600
"DEREK SAYS."
IT'S GOOD ADVICE.

03:01.633 --> 03:04.300
HE'S MY FRIEND.
THAT'S GOOD FRIEND ADVICE.

03:04.333 --> 03:05.700
MEREDITH...

03:05.733 --> 03:06.667
WHAT?

03:06.700 --> 03:09.100
DID YOU SNEAK OUT
LAST NIGHT?

03:09.133 --> 03:12.267
YEAH. I, UH...
I COULDN'T SLEEP.

03:12.300 --> 03:13.400
COME ON.

03:13.433 --> 03:14.767
WHERE?
E.R.

03:14.800 --> 03:15.800
ALL OF US?

03:15.833 --> 03:17.367
WE'VE ALL HAD DEATHS.

03:17.400 --> 03:19.400
LET'S ALL GO SAVE A LIFE.

03:23.533 --> 03:26.333
UH, DR. BAILEY.

03:26.367 --> 03:27.667
HERE YOU GO.

03:27.700 --> 03:29.267
WHAT'S THIS?
HOT COCOA.

03:29.300 --> 03:31.200
IT'S A LITTLE RITUAL
WE HAD IN NEW YORK.

03:31.233 --> 03:32.733
FOUR SURGERIES, FOUR DEATHS.

03:32.767 --> 03:36.100
I FIGURE WE COULD ALL USE
A LITTLE GOOD JUJU.
AND COCOA EQUALS JUJU HOW?

03:36.133 --> 03:39.367
HEY, HEY, HEY,
DON'T QUESTION THE COCOA.

03:39.400 --> 03:42.067
CARRY ON.

03:42.067 --> 03:43.633
MEREDITH...

03:43.667 --> 03:46.467
THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP
THIS MORNING.

03:46.500 --> 03:49.067
OH, THANK YOU, ADDISON.

03:50.400 --> 03:53.400
YEAH.
YOU KNOW, THANK YOU.

03:56.267 --> 03:58.167
(clears throat)
HERE YOU GO.

03:58.200 --> 03:59.133
JUJU.

03:59.167 --> 04:00.100
YEP.

04:00.133 --> 04:01.333
YOU JUJUED MEREDITH.

04:01.367 --> 04:02.767
I DID...

04:02.800 --> 04:04.733
IN THE SPIRIT OF FRIENDSHIP.

04:04.767 --> 04:07.267
HMM.

04:07.300 --> 04:09.567
WHAT, ARE WE NOT BEING FRIENDS
WITH MEREDITH ANYMORE?

04:09.600 --> 04:11.733
NO, NO, WE ARE.
MEREDITH AND I ARE FRIENDS.

04:11.767 --> 04:13.533
YEAH, AND YOU AND I
ARE MARRIED.

04:13.567 --> 04:15.467
SO THEN BY PROXY,
MEREDITH AND I ARE FRIENDS.

04:15.500 --> 04:17.400
THAT'S VERY BIG OF YOU.
YEAH, WELL...

04:17.433 --> 04:19.333
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

04:19.367 --> 04:21.267
IT'S NOT LIKE
I'M GONNA BE FRIENDS WITH,

04:21.300 --> 04:23.200
LET'S SAY, UH... MARK.

04:23.233 --> 04:25.433
YEAH, WELL, NEITHER AM I.

04:25.467 --> 04:27.833
NOW FINISH YOUR JUJU
BEFORE SOMEBODY ELSE DIES.

04:27.867 --> 04:28.800
MM-HMM.

04:28.833 --> 04:31.067
HMM.

04:37.433 --> 04:39.333
THERE ARE TEN OF THEM--
MUSIC NOTES, COLORFUL PATTERNS,

04:39.367 --> 04:41.767
THEY WERE SENT OUT
LAST NIGHT.

04:41.800 --> 04:44.500
SORRY TO HEAR ABOUT YOUR VALVE
REPLACEMENT THIS MORNING.

04:44.533 --> 04:47.067
THE LAUNDRY MISPLACED
MY SCRUB CAPS.

04:47.100 --> 04:48.533
YOU KNOW, THERE'S SOME
FOOLISH TALK GOIN' AROUND

04:48.567 --> 04:50.467
ABOUT FATALLY CLUSTERS
IN THREES AND SEVENS.

04:50.500 --> 04:53.200
ARE YOU SURE THEY WEREN'T SENT
TO ANOTHER HOSPITAL?

04:53.233 --> 04:55.267
HOW MANY ELECTIVES
HAVE THEY CANCELED TODAY?

04:55.300 --> 04:56.467
THIS IS OUR THIRD.

04:56.500 --> 04:58.733
AND WHAT HAVE THE SURGEONS
BEEN GIVING AS THEIR REASONS?

04:58.767 --> 05:01.367
BECAUSE I PREFER
MY OWN CAPS.

05:01.400 --> 05:02.733
YOU'RE NOT PUSHING
YOUR SURGERIES

05:02.767 --> 05:05.500
BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE
YOUR PERSONAL CAPS.

05:05.533 --> 05:07.200
YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

05:07.233 --> 05:09.167
I DIDN'T PUSH
ANY SURGERIES.

05:09.200 --> 05:11.267
NO, NO, THE QUESTION IS,
WHEN WILL YOU FIND THEM?

05:11.300 --> 05:14.700
NO ONE CHANGES THAT BOARD
UNLESS THEY TALK TO ME.

05:14.733 --> 05:16.767
NO ONE.

05:19.633 --> 05:22.567
GREAT. NO BLOOD, NO GUTS,
NO LIVES TO SAVE.

05:22.600 --> 05:24.133
IT'S DEAD QUIET.

05:24.167 --> 05:25.733
DID YOU REALLY
JUST SAY THAT?
CRISTINA.

05:25.767 --> 05:27.333
WHAT?
YOU SAID THE "Q" WORD.

05:27.367 --> 05:28.833
THAT'S LIKE SAYING
MACBETH IN THE THEATER.

05:28.867 --> 05:30.767
PLEASE. YOU THINK BECAUSE
SOMEONE SAYS IT'S QUIET,

05:30.800 --> 05:33.333
THAT IT'LL MEAN--
CAN SOMEONE PLEASE
HELP US HERE?

05:33.367 --> 05:34.833
SHE'S COUGHING UP BLOOD.

05:34.867 --> 05:36.433
O'MALLEY, TAKE THAT.
(pager beeps)

05:36.467 --> 05:37.800
DENNY DUQUETTE.
I GOT IT.

05:37.833 --> 05:40.700
HE'S MY PATIENT.
HE'S BOTH YOUR PATIENTS.
ANSWER THE CALL.

05:40.733 --> 05:41.733

05:41.767 --> 05:43.767
TWO INCOMING.

05:46.633 --> 05:50.067

05:52.333 --> 05:54.700
OKAY, UH, YANG,
FIRST ONE'S YOURS.

05:54.733 --> 05:56.767
GREY, TAKE NUMBER TWO.

05:58.567 --> 06:00.067
JESSE FANNON, 32,

06:00.067 --> 06:01.800
UNRESTRAINED DRIVER

06:01.833 --> 06:03.733
THERE WAS SPIDER WEBBING
OF THE FRONT WINDSHIELD

06:03.767 --> 06:05.667
WHERE HIS HEAD HIT.

06:05.700 --> 06:07.600
B.P. IS 120 PALP.
PULSE IS 75.

06:07.633 --> 06:09.467
(Miranda)
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO, YANG?

06:09.500 --> 06:11.667
A PRIMARY
AND SECONDARY SURVEY,

06:11.700 --> 06:13.367
UH, HEAD C.T. AND X-RAY.

06:13.400 --> 06:15.333
GREAT, PAGE SHEPHERD
WHEN YOU GET THERE.

06:15.367 --> 06:17.267
WAIT! I'M COUNTING
THE SIREN WHOOPS.

06:17.300 --> 06:18.200
WE CAN'T GO TILL
IT REACHES 33.

06:18.233 --> 06:22.067
HE ALSO SEEMS TO HAVE
A TOUCH OF O.C.D.

06:22.100 --> 06:23.833
NIKKI RATLIN, 30,
ERRATIC B.P. IN THE FIELD,

06:23.867 --> 06:26.100
COMPLAINING OF CHEST
AND LEG PAIN.
WHAT HAPPENED?

06:26.133 --> 06:27.767
I GOT STRUCK BY LIGHTNING.

06:29.300 --> 06:31.400
CAN ANYONE SPELL
"COINCIDENCE"?

06:41.700 --> 06:44.133
MY HOROSCOPE SAID,
"STAY CLOSE TO HOME TODAY."

06:44.167 --> 06:46.067
ARIES COULDN'T HAVE BEEN
ANY CLEARER.

06:46.100 --> 06:47.833
OKAY,
I GUESS IT COULDA SAID,

06:47.867 --> 06:50.067
"DON'T LEAVE THE HOUSE TODAY
UNLESS YOU WANT TO GET

06:50.100 --> 06:51.433
STRUCK BY LIGHTNING." OW.

06:51.467 --> 06:54.667
SEE, MS. RATLIN, YOU HAVE NO
SIGN OF WOUNDS FROM LIGHTNING.

06:54.700 --> 06:55.733
IT WAS A SIGN.

06:55.767 --> 06:59.133
CLEARLY, GETTING STRUCK
BY LIGHTNING IS A SIGN.

06:59.167 --> 07:01.067
A SIGN THAT I SHOULDN'T
HAVE LEFT MY HOUSE.

07:01.100 --> 07:02.833
NIKKI, NORMALLY PEOPLE
STRUCK BY LIGHTNING.

07:02.867 --> 07:07.433
HAVE A WOUND WHERE THE BOLT
ENTERED AND EXITED THE BODY.

07:07.467 --> 07:11.267
WELL... WELL, I WASN'T
"STRUCK" STRUCK.

07:11.300 --> 07:15.367
I--THE TREE WAS STRUCK
AND IT FELL ON ME.

07:15.400 --> 07:17.067
A TREE FELL ON YOU?

07:17.067 --> 07:18.767
A BIG, LIKE, BRANCH

07:18.800 --> 07:20.467
OR A LIMB--WHATEVER.

07:20.500 --> 07:22.667
SAME DIFFERENCE.

07:22.700 --> 07:25.567
NO, ACTUALLY, MEDICALLY,
IT ISN'T THE SAME DIFFERENCE.

07:25.600 --> 07:28.767
AND IT WOULD BE HELPFUL IF,
FROM NOW ON...

07:28.800 --> 07:30.700
OW.
YOU TOLD US
THE WHOLE TRUTH.

07:30.733 --> 07:33.100
YOU WANNA KNOW THE TRUTH?

07:33.133 --> 07:34.400
MY BOYFRIEND LOVES THAT TREE.

07:34.433 --> 07:37.400
HE'S TOTALLY GONNA FREAK OUT.

07:37.433 --> 07:39.733
(laughs) OW.

07:39.767 --> 07:42.633
OH, CHIEF, THERE'S A, UH,

50s, UH, BLONDE HAIR.

07:50.467 --> 07:53.500
SHE SAID SHE'S KNOWN YOU
FOR ABOUT 20 YEARS.

07:53.533 --> 07:55.167
ARE YOU TAKING ABOUT OLLIE?

07:55.200 --> 07:56.400
RIGHT. OKAY.

07:56.433 --> 07:58.333
UH, OLLIE WARNER--
SHE PRESENTED WITH, UH,

07:58.367 --> 08:00.167
UPPER G.I. BLEEDING.

AND SHE HAD A T.I.P.P.S.
PROCEDURE LAST MONTH

08:02.133 --> 08:04.167
FOR ESOPHAGEAL VARICES.

08:12.567 --> 08:14.467
I'LL TAKE THIS FROM HERE,
O'MALLEY.

08:14.500 --> 08:15.833
I'M HAPPY TO HELP, SIR.

08:15.867 --> 08:17.367
NO, THANK YOU.

08:17.400 --> 08:19.467
I GOT THIS MYSELF.

08:21.267 --> 08:22.600
(Ollie) THANK YOU.

08:22.633 --> 08:24.267
OLLIE.

08:24.300 --> 08:26.067
(sighs) RICHARD.

08:26.100 --> 08:28.133
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

08:28.167 --> 08:31.200
(breathing heavily)

08:31.233 --> 08:33.133
SINUS TACHYCARDIA,
LOW GRADE FEVER,

08:33.167 --> 08:36.433
PULSE OX 75.

08:36.467 --> 08:39.467
I'M HEARING RALES
IN YOUR LUNGS.

08:39.500 --> 08:43.533
YEAH, A FREIGHT TRAIN
ROLLS THROUGH AT NOON.

08:43.567 --> 08:45.367
HOW BAD IS THE PAIN?

08:45.400 --> 08:48.200
I DON'T KNOW. A FIVE
OR SIX WHEN I BREATHE.

08:48.233 --> 08:50.133
THAT MEANS A SEVEN OR EIGHT

08:50.167 --> 08:52.833
WHEN YOU'RE NOT TRYING
TO IMPRESS YOUR DOCTOR.

08:52.867 --> 08:57.433
I HEARD, UH, FOUR PEOPLE
DIED IN SURGERY THIS MORNING.

08:57.467 --> 08:59.367
SAID THEY WERE EXPECTING
THREE MORE.

08:59.400 --> 09:01.433
YOU GET THAT FROM A NURSE?

09:01.467 --> 09:04.200
NEVER REVEAL MY SOURCES.

09:04.233 --> 09:06.367
JUST LIKE TO AVOID THE O.R.

09:11.533 --> 09:14.333
AND I'M NOT LIKING
THAT LOOK.

09:18.200 --> 09:20.800
THIS COULD BE
A PULMONARY EMBOLISM, DENNY--

09:20.833 --> 09:22.667
A COMPLICATION
FROM THE LVAD SURGERY.

09:22.700 --> 09:25.733
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO TALK
TO DR. BURKE.

09:25.767 --> 09:27.600
AHEM.

09:29.467 --> 09:31.233
(elevator bell dings)

09:34.867 --> 09:36.800
I GOT HOT CHOCOLATED.

09:36.833 --> 09:39.167
THE SHE-SHEPHERD
HOT CHOCOLATED ME.

09:39.200 --> 09:40.667
IT'S HER JUJU.

09:40.700 --> 09:42.300
I DON'T LIKE PEOPLE
WHO SAY JUJU.

09:42.333 --> 09:44.167
I SAY JUJU.
JUJU, JUJU, JUJU.

09:44.200 --> 09:45.667
JUJU, JUJU, JUJU.

09:45.700 --> 09:47.067
JUJU, JUJU, JUJU...

09:47.100 --> 09:49.300
I DIDN'T DRINK IT.

09:49.333 --> 09:52.400
YOU'RE NOT OBLIGATED TO HONOR
SOME ELSE'S JUJU.

09:52.433 --> 09:54.400
(Jesse) JUJU, JUJU...
THOUGHT YOU WERE
BEING FRIENDS.

09:54.433 --> 09:56.300
I AM, WITH HIM.

09:56.333 --> 09:58.233
DO I HAVE TO BE FRIENDS
WITH HER, TOO?

09:58.267 --> 09:59.400
DEFINITELY NOT

09:59.433 --> 10:00.800
MAYBE.

10:00.833 --> 10:02.733
JUJU, JUJU, JUJU.
JUJU, JUJU, JUJU...

10:02.767 --> 10:04.667
I'LL, UH, CALL PSYCH
FOR YOU.

10:04.700 --> 10:06.300
THAT WOULD BE GOOD,
THANKS.

10:06.333 --> 10:08.767
(bone cracks)
OH! OW!

10:08.800 --> 10:10.667
OHH!
ALL RIGHT,
THAT'S THE WORST OF IT.

10:10.700 --> 10:14.300
OH, I NEVER SHOULD'VE
GOTTEN OUT OF BED. OH!

10:14.333 --> 10:17.233
BUT I REALLY WANTED
TO SURPRISE MY BOYFRIEND

10:17.267 --> 10:18.667
BEFORE HE LEFT FOR SCHOOL.

10:18.700 --> 10:21.400
HE HAD A HUGE EXAM TODAY,
AND I JUST, YOU KNOW,

10:21.433 --> 10:23.333
I WANTED TO WISH HIM LUCK.

10:23.367 --> 10:25.467
DR. TORRES, HEY.

10:25.500 --> 10:27.833
HI. UH, CAN I GIVE YOU A HAND?

10:27.867 --> 10:30.067
YOU MISSED THE BOAT,
GEORGE.

10:30.100 --> 10:32.133
YOU MEAN ON THIS CASE OR...

10:32.167 --> 10:33.833
OR A HOT CHICK
GIVES YOU HER NUMBER,

10:33.867 --> 10:36.333
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO CALL.
YEAH.

10:36.367 --> 10:38.267
(whispers) RIGHT. I WAS.
I MEAN, I AM.

10:38.300 --> 10:39.567
TOO LATE.

10:39.600 --> 10:41.500
OUCH. DON'T GIVE UP.

10:41.533 --> 10:43.433
I MEAN,
IF YOU REALLY LIKE HER.

10:47.100 --> 10:48.033
YEAH.

10:48.067 --> 10:50.067
OKAY.

10:52.133 --> 10:54.567
OKAY...

10:54.600 --> 10:55.833
THE PLOT THICKENS.

10:55.867 --> 10:57.500
NIKKI, DR. GREY HERE

10:57.533 --> 10:59.600
IS GONNA TAKE YOU UPSTAIRS
FOR A C.T.

10:59.633 --> 11:01.567
BUT BEFORE SHE DOES,
I HAVE TO ASK,

11:01.600 --> 11:03.667
YOU'RE BRUISED ALL UP AND DOWN
YOUR LEFT SIDE.

11:03.700 --> 11:06.533
YOU SURE A TREE BRANCH
DID ALL THIS?
YOU THINK MY BOYFRIEND
DID THIS?

11:06.567 --> 11:09.633
HE WOULD NEVER HIT
A WOMAN, EVER.

11:09.667 --> 11:12.800
MM-HMM. THE BRUISING DOESN'T
LOOK LIKE A TREE BRANCH HIT YOU.

11:12.833 --> 11:15.067
FINE.

11:15.067 --> 11:18.067
OKAY, YOU GUYS ARE GONNA THINK
I'M REALLY WEIRD,

11:18.100 --> 11:20.533
BUT I WAS SORT OF
UP IN THE TREE

11:20.567 --> 11:22.167
WHEN THE LIGHTNING HIT,

11:22.200 --> 11:24.367
AND, WELL...

11:24.400 --> 11:26.300
YOU CLIMBED A TREE
IN A THUNDERSTORM?

11:26.333 --> 11:28.367
I REALLY WANTED IT TO BE
A SURPRISE, YOU KNOW,

11:28.400 --> 11:31.367
FOR MY BOYFRIEND,
AND, UM, I JUST...

11:31.400 --> 11:33.600
I HAD TO SEE IF HIS PSYCHO DOG
WAS IN THE YARD

11:33.633 --> 11:37.200
BECAUSE OF, LIKE,
THE BARKING AND STUFF AND...

11:37.233 --> 11:39.333
I KNOW.
IT SOUNDS REALLY WEIRD.

11:39.367 --> 11:41.100
DOES IT SOUND REALLY WEIRD?

11:41.133 --> 11:42.600
NOT AT ALL.
NO.

11:42.633 --> 11:45.800
AND THE THING IS,
I MEAN, HE WASN'T EVEN THERE.

11:45.833 --> 11:46.767
THE DOG?

11:46.800 --> 11:48.700
NO, MY BOYFRIEND.

11:48.733 --> 11:50.533
HE WASN'T EVEN HOME.

11:50.567 --> 11:51.767
(sighs)

11:51.800 --> 11:54.733
I REALLY SHOULDN'T
HAVE GOTTEN OUT OF BED.

11:54.767 --> 11:56.267
OH, DR. SHEPHERD.

11:56.300 --> 11:57.367
HMM?

11:57.400 --> 11:59.433
I'VE GOT A 34-YEAR-OLD MALE
WITH A BLUNT HEAD TRAUMA

11:59.467 --> 12:01.133
AND SEVERE CASE OF O.C.D.

12:01.167 --> 12:03.067
OH, REALLY? DID YOU CALL
FOR A PSYCH CONSULT?
YES.

12:03.100 --> 12:04.833
ALL RIGHT, LET ME KNOW
WHEN YOU GET HIS C.T.
OKAY.

12:04.867 --> 12:07.167
THANK YOU.

12:07.200 --> 12:08.667
HEY.

12:08.700 --> 12:09.733
HEY.

12:09.767 --> 12:13.533
HEY, UH, SORRY ABOUT THAT,
UH, VALVE REPLACEMENT.

12:13.567 --> 12:15.800
OH, THANK YOU.
THE LAUNDRY LOST MY CAPS.

12:15.833 --> 12:17.467
THE GUY DIDN'T DIE

12:17.500 --> 12:19.567
BECAUSE YOU WEREN'T WEARING
ONE OF YOUR CAPS.

12:19.600 --> 12:21.300
WELL, I KNOW THAT.

12:21.333 --> 12:24.200
I JUST PREFER...
TO OPERATE WEARING MY OWN.

12:24.233 --> 12:25.433
IT'S A COMFORT THING.

12:25.467 --> 12:27.100
HUH. WELL...

12:27.133 --> 12:29.067
I PREFER HAVING GEORGE
OUT OF OUR APARTMENT.

12:29.067 --> 12:31.067
SO I GUESS WE BOTH HAVE
COMFORT THINGS.

12:31.067 --> 12:32.733
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

12:32.767 --> 12:35.367
UH, YOU KNOW, UM...

12:35.400 --> 12:37.500
I HAVE ONE OF YOUR CAPS
IN MY LOCKER.

12:37.533 --> 12:40.400
WHY DO YOU HAVE ONE OF MY CAPS
IN YOUR LOCKER?
OH, THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

12:40.433 --> 12:42.333
YOU KNOW, THE POINT IS, UH,

12:42.367 --> 12:44.267
IS THAT I THINK
I'M GONNA KEEP IT HOSTAGE.

12:44.300 --> 12:47.767
SO YOU KICK BAMBI OUT,
YOU GET YOUR CAP BACK.

12:47.800 --> 12:50.067
OH, WELL, I DON'T DO WELL
WITH ULTIMATUMS.

12:50.067 --> 12:53.333
MAYBE YOU SHOULD THINK OF IT
MORE AS A TRADE.

12:54.767 --> 12:57.233
DR. BURKE...
I'VE GOT FREE TIME.

12:57.267 --> 13:00.133
DO YOU HAVE ANY CASES?
DO YOU NEED ANY HELP?

13:00.167 --> 13:02.500
ACTUALLY, I DO.

13:02.533 --> 13:04.267
(elevator bell dings)

13:04.300 --> 13:06.200
CRISTINA HAS SOMETHING
OF MINE,

13:06.233 --> 13:08.133
AND I NEED YOU
TO GET IT BACK.

13:08.167 --> 13:09.433
(dings)

13:11.333 --> 13:13.233
JUST CALL CATHERINE BACK.

13:13.267 --> 13:15.067
YEAH.

13:15.100 --> 13:18.733
GRETCHEN, WOULD YOU MIND
LEAVING US ALONE FOR A MINUTE?

13:18.767 --> 13:19.700
OKAY.

13:19.733 --> 13:21.800
THANK YOU.

13:21.833 --> 13:25.367
SHE'S MY NEW BABY.
SIX MONTHS SOBER.

13:25.400 --> 13:27.333
SHE'S ALREADY
ON THE NINTH STEP.

13:27.367 --> 13:28.567
YOU MUST BE PROUD.

13:28.600 --> 13:30.467
ALWAYS.

13:30.500 --> 13:32.400
YOU'RE ON
THE TRANSPLANT LIST, OLLIE?

13:32.433 --> 13:34.133
COUPLE OF YEARS NOW.

13:36.067 --> 13:39.133
THE SCLEROSIS PREVENTS BLOOD
FROM FLOWING INTO YOUR LIVER,

13:39.167 --> 13:41.567
SO IT'S BACKING UP
INTO YOUR ESOPHAGUS,

13:41.600 --> 13:43.500
'CAUSING THE RUPTURES.

13:43.533 --> 13:45.133
IT'S SERIOUS, OL.

13:45.167 --> 13:46.633
WELL, OF COURSE IT IS.

13:46.667 --> 13:49.067
I MEAN, YOU DON'T PUKE BLOOD
IF IT'S NOT SERIOUS.

13:49.067 --> 13:52.500
THE QUESTION IS,
CAN YOU TREAT IT?

13:52.533 --> 13:54.133
MAYBE.

13:54.167 --> 13:55.333
SURGICALLY.

13:55.367 --> 13:58.233
WE'LL HAVE TO RUN
MORE TESTS AND...

13:58.267 --> 14:03.067
WHATEVER WE DO,
IT'S A STOPGAP.

14:03.067 --> 14:05.167
YOU NEED A NEW LIVER.

14:06.667 --> 14:10.200
YET ANOTHER REASON I SHOULDA
LAID OFF THE SAUCE.

14:10.233 --> 14:13.367
(chuckles)

14:13.400 --> 14:16.333
YOU LOOK SCARED.

14:16.367 --> 14:18.367
I AM SCARED, OLLIE.

14:18.400 --> 14:22.233
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
AT A MEETING IN AWHILE.

14:22.267 --> 14:23.767
I KNOW, I KNOW.

14:23.800 --> 14:26.267
HOW HAVE YOU BEEN?

14:26.300 --> 14:28.133
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YOU.

14:28.167 --> 14:30.233
NOW I'M ASKING ABOUT YOU.

14:30.267 --> 14:33.267
***

14:39.533 --> 14:43.333
ELLIS GREY'S DAUGHTER
IS WORKING AT THE HOSPITAL.

14:43.367 --> 14:47.467
ELLIS IS IN A NURSING HOME
WITH ALZHEIMER'S.

14:47.500 --> 14:49.400
***

14:49.433 --> 14:52.333
I TRY TO GO SEE HER
EVERY CHANCE I GET.

14:52.367 --> 14:55.567
YOU'RE HAVING AN AFFAIR
WITH THE WOMAN

14:55.600 --> 14:57.733
WHO DROVE YOU
TO YOUR ALCOHOLIC BOTTOM?

14:57.767 --> 14:59.667
OLLIE, WE'RE NOT HAVING
AN AFFAIR.

14:59.700 --> 15:01.367
SHE'S SICK.

15:01.400 --> 15:02.533
YOU'RE LYING TO YOUR WIFE?

15:02.567 --> 15:04.233
I'M NOT LYING.

15:04.267 --> 15:06.367
YOU'RE LYING BY OMISSION.

15:06.400 --> 15:07.600
YOU ARE HAVING
AN EMOTIONAL AFFAIR

15:07.633 --> 15:09.833
AND NOW YOU'RE LYING
TO YOUR SPONSOR ABOUT IT.

15:09.867 --> 15:12.067
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN MY SPONSOR
IN YEARS.

15:12.100 --> 15:14.067
I STILL HAVE THE RIGHT
TO BUST YOUR ASS

15:14.100 --> 15:15.633
IF I SEE YOU SLIPPING.

15:15.667 --> 15:17.600
I'M NOT SLIPPING.

15:17.633 --> 15:20.067
NOT YET, BUT YOU'RE MAKING
A PRETTY BIG MESS.

15:21.467 --> 15:24.667
***

15:31.133 --> 15:33.233
HOW MANY YEARS
YOU HAVE NOW?

15:33.267 --> 15:36.200
JUST PASSED 17.

15:37.333 --> 15:39.433
I'M PROUD OF YOU.

15:40.867 --> 15:44.067
***

15:45.533 --> 15:48.567
AND I'M SCARED, TOO.

15:48.600 --> 15:50.800
YOU GOT ME SOBER, OLLIE.

15:50.833 --> 15:53.300
YOU WALKED ME THROUGH IT.

15:53.333 --> 15:56.333
***

15:58.400 --> 16:02.067
AND I'M GONNA WALK YOU
THROUGH THIS.

16:02.067 --> 16:04.133
***

16:14.400 --> 16:16.400
OOPS.

16:16.800 --> 16:20.067
SHE STILL HAS THE...

16:20.100 --> 16:22.067
OH, THAT'S....

16:22.100 --> 16:22.867
OH.

16:22.900 --> 16:24.267
YOU'RE A PERVIE
LITTLE BOY, GEORGE,

16:24.300 --> 16:26.167
AND YOU'RE NOT FINDING
THE CAP.

16:26.200 --> 16:27.133
I'LL DO YOUR DISHES
FOR A MONTH.
I DON'T DO DISHES.

16:27.167 --> 16:29.600
I'LL DO YOUR LAUNDRY.
I DON'T DO LAUNDRY.

16:29.633 --> 16:31.600
MAYBE THAT'S WHY BURKE LIKES
HAVING ME AROUND SO MUCH.

16:31.633 --> 16:34.300
INTERESTING, INTERESTING.
ARE YOU HAVING SEX WITH HIM?
NO.

16:34.333 --> 16:36.067
THEN HE LIKES HAVING ME
AROUND MORE.

16:36.100 --> 16:38.067
WHY DOES IT ALWAYS
HAVE TO BE A COMPETITION?

16:38.067 --> 16:39.800
WHAT DO YOU WANT
FOR THE CAP?

16:39.833 --> 16:42.167
YOU OUTTA THE APARTMENT.
I'M NOT LEAVING TILL BURKE
SAYS I HAVE TO LEAVE.

16:42.200 --> 16:44.467
THEN YOU'RE NOT GETTING
THE CAP.

16:44.500 --> 16:46.067
NOW CLEAN UP MY CRAP.

16:46.067 --> 16:47.567
NO.

16:50.800 --> 16:53.433
WOW. IS THAT HER SPLEEN?

16:53.467 --> 16:55.367
LOOKS LIKE
A GRADE III LACERATION,

16:55.400 --> 16:56.567
MAYBE A IV.

16:56.600 --> 16:58.500
WHAT WAS SHE DOING
STANDING UNDER A TREE

16:58.533 --> 17:00.200
IN A THUNDERSTORM?

17:00.233 --> 17:03.200
SHE WASN'T STANDING UNDER IT.
SHE WAS CLIMBING IT.

17:03.233 --> 17:04.167
WHY?

17:04.200 --> 17:06.467
UH...
I'M GETTING THE FEELING

17:06.500 --> 17:08.400
SHE'S A LITTLE BIT
OF A STALKER.

17:08.433 --> 17:10.333
DO WE NEED TO CALL
THE POLICE?
I DON'T THINK SO.

17:10.367 --> 17:11.800
I THINK SHE'S MORE
OF A "GENTLE" STALKER

17:11.833 --> 17:13.733
THAN A "KILL YOU
WITH A KNIFE" STALKER.

17:13.767 --> 17:14.867
RIGHT.

17:14.900 --> 17:18.167
WELL, LET'S HOPE SHE LIVES
TO GENTLY STALK ANOTHER DAY.

17:19.600 --> 17:21.767
HEY, YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN
THAT SEVEN FATALLY THING,

17:21.800 --> 17:23.333
DO YOU?

17:23.367 --> 17:26.233
I BELIEVE THIS GIRL NEEDS
HER SPLEEN REMOVED IMMEDIATELY.

17:26.267 --> 17:28.533
GO PICK UP HER LABS
AND GET HER ON THE BOARD.

17:28.567 --> 17:30.167
THEN WE'LL BREAK THE NEWS.

17:32.400 --> 17:36.233
(Izzie) IT'S ALMOST OVER.

17:36.267 --> 17:38.400
YOU LIKE HORSES, IZZIE?

17:38.433 --> 17:40.633
EVERYBODY LIKES HORSES.

17:40.667 --> 17:42.833
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

17:42.867 --> 17:46.167
YOU KNOW, HORSES ARE
A GREAT JUDGE OF CHARACTER.

17:46.200 --> 17:49.067
YOU DON'T LIKE HORSES,
IT MEANS THEY DON'T LIKE YOU.

17:49.100 --> 17:50.333
HUH.

17:50.367 --> 17:53.633
I'VE GOT AN UNCLE
THAT'S A RODEO COWBOY.

17:58.100 --> 18:00.267
NO KIDDIN'?

18:00.300 --> 18:02.633
THIS IS A BIG CLOT,
DENNY.

18:02.667 --> 18:04.567
I CAN'T GET IT
WITH A CATHETER.

18:04.600 --> 18:06.067
I'M SORRY.

18:06.100 --> 18:08.767
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO OPEN
YOUR CHEST AGAIN.

18:08.800 --> 18:10.700
(Jesse)
I WAS COUNTING THE CLICKS--

18:10.733 --> 18:12.733
THE TURN SIGNAL CLICKS.

18:12.767 --> 18:16.100
I COULDN'T MOVE
TILL IT HIT 333.

18:16.133 --> 18:18.833
THE LIGHT WAS GREEN,
BUT I COULDN'T MOVE.

18:18.867 --> 18:21.367
I CAN'T BLAME THEM
FOR HITTING ME.

18:21.400 --> 18:23.300
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN FEELING
THESE COMPULSIONS?

18:23.333 --> 18:25.233
A LITTLE BIT ALL MY LIFE,

18:25.267 --> 18:27.167
BUT IT'S BEEN OUT OF CONTROL
THE LAST THREE YEARS.

18:27.200 --> 18:29.100
ONSET AT 30 IS TYPICAL.

18:29.133 --> 18:31.100
RUINED A MARRIAGE.
I CAN'T HOLD A JOB.

18:31.133 --> 18:32.500
(Cristina) MR. FANNON,
DO YOU--

18:32.533 --> 18:34.467
IS IT CLEAN?

18:34.500 --> 18:36.400
I NEED TO KNOW IF IT'S CLEAN.
IT'S VERY CLEAN.

18:36.433 --> 18:38.267
IT'S VERY CLEAN.
IT'S VERY CLEAN.

18:38.300 --> 18:40.533
ANY RELATIVES WITH O.C.D.?
MY MOTHER.

18:40.567 --> 18:41.767
KILLED HERSELF AT 38.

18:41.800 --> 18:43.700
IT RUINED HER LIFE,
NOW IT'S RUINING MINE.

18:43.733 --> 18:47.500
(clears throat)

18:48.767 --> 18:50.233
CLEAN, CLEAN CLEAN?

18:50.267 --> 18:52.167
I--WE CLEAN IT
BETWEEN EACH PATIENT.

18:52.200 --> 18:55.067
I THINK HE NEEDS YOU TO SAY,
"CLEAN, CLEAN, CLEAN."

18:55.067 --> 18:57.733
IT'S CLEAN, CLEAN, CLEAN.

18:57.767 --> 18:59.100
THANK YOU.

18:59.133 --> 19:01.833
I KNOW IT'S ANNOYING.
I CAN'T HELP IT.

19:01.867 --> 19:04.300
FIND A PENNY, PICK IT UP.

19:04.333 --> 19:06.467
ALL DAY LONG,
YOU'LL HAVE GOOD LUCK.

19:06.500 --> 19:08.400
FIND A PENNY, PICK IT UP.

19:08.433 --> 19:10.633
ALL DAY LONG,
YOU'LL HAVE GOOD LUCK.
MR. FANNON,
DO YOU WANT--

19:10.667 --> 19:11.833
FIND A PENNY, PICK IT UP...

19:11.867 --> 19:13.767
REPETITIVE RHYMES, PRAYERS--
IT'S CLASSIC.

19:13.800 --> 19:16.467
HE FEELS HE NEEDS TO SAY IT
A SPECIFIC NUMBER OF TIMES,

19:16.500 --> 19:17.500
PROBABLY A MULTIPLE
OF THREE.

19:17.533 --> 19:20.300
LET'S GET HIM IN BEFORE
HE DECIDES TO START AGAIN.

19:20.333 --> 19:24.333
IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT
WITH, UH, THAT?

19:24.367 --> 19:26.600
FIND A PENNY, PICK IT UP.

19:26.633 --> 19:28.533
ALL DAY LONG,
YOU'LL HAVE GOOD LUCK.

19:28.567 --> 19:30.267
JUST DON'T LOOK AT HIM.

19:32.867 --> 19:33.800
OH.

19:33.833 --> 19:35.067
HEY.

19:35.067 --> 19:36.533
HI.

19:36.567 --> 19:37.567
HEY--

19:37.600 --> 19:39.567
OH, HEY.
HI.

19:39.600 --> 19:41.600
HI.

19:41.633 --> 19:44.067
I, UH... HAVE TO

19:44.067 --> 19:45.433
YEAH.
YEAH.

19:45.467 --> 19:47.200
I DO, TOO.

19:47.233 --> 19:49.300
YEAH, I GOT SOMETHING, TOO,
SO...

19:51.633 --> 19:54.667
I WISH I HAD GOOD NEWS.

19:54.700 --> 19:57.333
THE T.I.P.P.S. PROCEDURE
YOU HAD LAST MONTH FAILED.

19:57.367 --> 19:58.533
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

19:58.567 --> 20:01.200
IT MEANS YOU'RE LUCKY
YOU GOT SOBER YOUNG.

20:01.233 --> 20:03.233
OLLIE, IT MEANS I'M GONNA
HAVE TO PUT IN

20:03.267 --> 20:04.633
A PORTACAVAL SHUNT.

20:04.667 --> 20:06.133
IT'S COMPLICATED.

20:06.167 --> 20:08.367
HAS ONLY A 50%
SURVIVAL RATE.

20:08.400 --> 20:10.333
WHAT'S MY OTHER CHOICE?

20:15.167 --> 20:18.033
OKAY, THEN. UM...

20:18.067 --> 20:20.067
YOU'LL BE THE ONE
TO DO IT?

20:21.400 --> 20:24.733
I'VE PERFORMED THIS SURGERY
NINE TIMES,

20:24.767 --> 20:27.133
HAD FOUR PATIENTS SURVIVE.

20:27.167 --> 20:30.733
IT'S PERFECT THEN.
I'LL BE YOUR FIVE OUT OF TEN.

20:35.233 --> 20:37.100
I'M NOT HAVING SURGERY TODAY.

20:37.133 --> 20:39.100
YOU HAVE A RUPTURED SPLEEN.

20:39.133 --> 20:40.800
AND I AM SURE THAT THE SPLEEN
IS VERY IMPORTANT,

20:40.833 --> 20:43.467
BUT I AM NOT
HAVING SURGERY TODAY.

20:43.500 --> 20:46.667
YOU CAN OPERATE AFTER MIDNIGHT,
BUT NOT ONE MINUTE BEFORE.

20:46.700 --> 20:48.600
MS. RATLIN, IF I THOUGHT
IT WOULD BE SAFE,

20:48.633 --> 20:50.533
I'D BE MORE THAN HAPPY
TO WAIT TILL AFTER MIDNIGHT.

20:50.567 --> 20:52.500
HOWEVER, I HAVE A HUSBAND
AND A BABY AT HOME

20:52.533 --> 20:54.033
WHO WON'T BE HAPPY.

20:54.067 --> 20:55.800
YOU KNOW WHO ELSE
WON'T BE HAPPY? YOU.

20:55.833 --> 20:57.800
YOUR SPLEEN IS BLEEDING.
SPLEEN TRUMPS HOROSCOPE.

20:57.833 --> 20:59.733
BUT IT WAS MORE
THAN JUST MY HOROSCOPE.

20:59.767 --> 21:01.600
I WENT OUT
TO MY CAR THIS MORNING--

21:01.633 --> 21:03.133
FLAT TIRE.

21:03.167 --> 21:05.067
THAT'S A SIGN,
BUT I JUST CHANGED THE TIRE.

21:05.100 --> 21:07.100
THEN THERE'S A WRECK
ON THE FREEWAY.

21:07.133 --> 21:10.067
DO I TURN AROUND AND GO HOME
LIKE IT'S TELLING ME TO? NO.

21:10.100 --> 21:12.467
I DETOUR AN HOUR
OUT OF MY WAY

21:12.500 --> 21:14.167
SO THAT I CAN GET
TO KEVIN'S HOUSE.

21:14.200 --> 21:16.567
AND WHEN I GET TO KEVIN'S HOUSE,
I GET STRUCK BY LIGHTNING.

21:16.600 --> 21:18.433
BUT YOU WEREN'T STRUCK
BY LIGHTNING.

21:18.467 --> 21:19.800
I'LL DIE, OKAY?

21:19.833 --> 21:22.767
IF YOU OPERATE ON ME TODAY,
I WILL DIE.

21:22.800 --> 21:24.233
'CAUSE I KNOW I WILL.

21:24.267 --> 21:26.333
PLEASE, JUST...

21:26.367 --> 21:28.667
JUST CALL MY BOYFRIEND

21:28.700 --> 21:31.467
AND TELL HIM THAT I'M HAVING
AN OPERATION AT MIDNIGHT,

21:31.500 --> 21:33.400
BECAUSE HE WILL WANT
TO BE HERE.

21:33.433 --> 21:34.467
OKAY.

21:34.500 --> 21:36.100
PLEASE.

21:38.767 --> 21:40.433
SHOULD I CALL PSYCH?

21:40.467 --> 21:41.633
YOU CAN GIVE IT A SHOT.

21:41.667 --> 21:43.567
IN THE MEANTIME,
GET HER DOWN TO I.C.U.

21:43.600 --> 21:48.267
POOR GIRL'S GONNA KILL HERSELF
TRYIN' NOT TO DIE.

21:51.800 --> 21:54.800
IZZIE PAINTS A PRETTY PICTURE
'CAUSE SHE LIKES YOU, YOU KNOW?

21:54.833 --> 21:56.733
OKAY.

21:56.767 --> 21:58.667
I'M JUST SAYIN',
SHE LIKES YOU.

21:58.700 --> 22:01.333
WHICH IS GONNA BE HARD
ON HER.

22:02.667 --> 22:04.667
YOU MEAN...

22:04.700 --> 22:06.567
WHEN I DIE?

22:06.600 --> 22:08.500
COME ON...

22:08.533 --> 22:12.700
I'M ASKIN' YOU,
MAN-TO-MAN.

22:12.733 --> 22:15.200
WITH A CLOT
IN YOUR PULMONARY ARTERY,

22:15.233 --> 22:17.133
IT'LL CUT OFF THE OXYGEN
TO YOUR LUNGS

22:17.167 --> 22:19.200
AND YOU'LL DIE OF HYPOXIA.

22:19.233 --> 22:21.133
IF THE HYPOXIA
DOESN'T KILL YOU,

22:21.167 --> 22:23.167
THE STRAIN
ON YOUR HEART WILL.

22:25.267 --> 22:26.667
AND THE SURGERY?

22:26.700 --> 22:28.167
IT'S NOT A ROUTINE PROCEDURE.

22:28.200 --> 22:30.100
YOU'RE AT SERIOUS RISK
FOR BLEEDING

22:30.133 --> 22:33.067
BECAUSE OF THE ANTICOAGULANTS
ALREADY IN YOUR SYSTEM.

22:34.800 --> 22:37.667
WHAT I'M SAYING
IS IZZIE LIKES YOU.

22:37.700 --> 22:40.667
AND SHE'S NOT GONNA BE
THE ONE TO PULL AWAY.

22:48.233 --> 22:49.267
(Meredith) HOW'S YOUR GUY?

22:49.300 --> 22:51.333
BRAIN'S BLEEDING.
NEEDS SURGERY. WANNA KNOW WHY?

22:51.367 --> 22:54.100
'CAUSE HE COULDN'T MOVE HIS CAR
UNTIL HE STOPPED COUNTING.

22:54.133 --> 22:56.133
MY GIRL--RUPTURED SPLEEN--

22:56.167 --> 22:57.833
WON'T HAVE SURGERY
BECAUSE OF HER HOROSCOPE.

22:57.867 --> 22:59.767
OH. WELL, WE SHOULD
INTRODUCE THEM.

22:59.800 --> 23:01.700
THEY'D MAKE A NICE,
CRAZY COUPLE.

23:01.733 --> 23:03.367
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

23:03.400 --> 23:06.600
I'M SITTING WITH MEREDITH.
HAVE SOME SELF-RESPECT.

23:06.633 --> 23:10.233
DR. BURKE'S ORDERS TRUMP ANY
PERSONAL ISSUES I MIGHT HAVE.

23:10.267 --> 23:12.067
IS THE CRAZINESS
RUBBING OFF ON HIM?

23:12.100 --> 23:15.100
HE'S TRYING TO STALK
BURKE'S LUCKY CAP OUT OF ME.

23:15.133 --> 23:16.267
BURKE HAS HAT JUJU?

23:16.300 --> 23:17.233
APPARENTLY.

23:17.267 --> 23:19.333
AND YOU'RE USING IT
AGAINST HIM?

23:19.367 --> 23:21.267
WELL,
THEY'RE FORCING ME TO...

23:21.300 --> 23:22.233
(sighs)

23:22.267 --> 23:24.167
BECAUSE OF
THE CLARINET PLAYING

23:24.200 --> 23:26.800
AND THE RUNNING
AND ALL THE BREAKFAST FOOD.

23:26.833 --> 23:28.500
YOU GUYS...

23:28.533 --> 23:31.467
THIS WHOLE DEATH CLUSTER THING
IS JUST RIDICULOUS, RIGHT?

23:31.500 --> 23:33.100
I MEAN, JUST 'CAUSE
FOUR DIED TODAY

23:33.133 --> 23:34.500
DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN

23:34.533 --> 23:38.333
THERE'S GONNA BE THREE MORE
BEFORE MIDNIGHT.
IT DOESN'T, TINKERBELL?

23:38.367 --> 23:41.067
FOR REALS?

23:41.100 --> 23:42.367
ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT DENNY?

23:42.400 --> 23:44.233
YEAH. OF COURSE I AM.

23:44.267 --> 23:46.067
HE'S MY PATIENT.

23:46.067 --> 23:47.800
I MEAN, IF YOU'RE ASKING ME

23:47.833 --> 23:50.100
IF I'M "WORRIED
ABOUT DENNY," NO.

23:50.133 --> 23:52.733
I'M SLEEPING WITH ALEX, SO...

23:52.767 --> 23:54.733
IT'S JUST...

23:54.767 --> 23:57.700
HEY, DID BURKE SAY ANYTHING
TO YOU ABOUT DENNY'S SURGERY?

23:57.733 --> 23:59.400
DID HE?

23:59.433 --> 24:01.333
NO, IT'S YOUR CASE.
YEAH. I KNOW.

24:01.367 --> 24:04.133
I'M JUST ASKING, YOU KNOW,
AS YOUR BOYFRIEND, DID HE--

24:04.167 --> 24:05.433
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
WHY YOU CARE.

24:05.467 --> 24:07.367
I MEAN, YOU'RE SLEEPING
WITH ALEX, RIGHT?

24:07.400 --> 24:08.333
YEAH.

24:08.367 --> 24:10.067
RIGHT. WHATEVER.

24:10.067 --> 24:11.233
I'M JUST SAYING...

24:11.267 --> 24:13.167
THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS A DEATH CLUSTER.

24:13.200 --> 24:16.367
IT'S JUST STUPID. RIGHT?

24:16.400 --> 24:19.167
I HAVE TO GO CONVINCE
MY PATIENT TO LET US OPERATE.

24:19.200 --> 24:21.700
MM-HMM.

24:21.733 --> 24:24.333
YOU'RE REMOVING
PART OF MY SKULLCAP?

24:24.367 --> 24:26.300
MM-HMM.
DO YOU REALLY
HAVE TO DO THAT?

24:26.333 --> 24:28.233
IT'S THE ONLY WAY
I CAN GET TO

24:28.267 --> 24:30.167
THE AFFECTED PART
OF THE BRAIN.

24:30.200 --> 24:33.067
AND THE OPERATING ROOM,
IT'S CLEAN, CLEAN, CLEAN?

24:33.100 --> 24:37.067
YES, IT'S CLEAN,
CLEAN, CLEAN.

24:37.067 --> 24:39.067
I'M GONNA GO GET READY.

24:44.733 --> 24:46.400
CAN YOU STOP THAT, PLEASE?

24:46.433 --> 24:49.267
NO. SORRY.
I WISH I COULD.

24:50.767 --> 24:52.267
SHE'S JUDGING ME.

24:52.300 --> 24:53.767
NO, SHE'S NOT.

24:53.800 --> 24:55.200
YES, SHE IS.

24:55.233 --> 24:57.133
I'VE BEEN LIVING WITH THIS
FOR THREE YEARS,

24:57.167 --> 24:59.067
AND IT'S ALWAYS THE PEOPLE
WHO ARE MOST LIKE ME

24:59.100 --> 25:00.433
WHO JUDGE ME THE MOST.

25:00.467 --> 25:02.467
YOU'RE TYPE "A," RIGHT?

25:02.500 --> 25:04.433
STRAIGHT-A STUDENT,
TOP OF YOUR CLASS?

25:04.467 --> 25:05.467
YES, I WAS.

25:05.500 --> 25:07.567
WELL, SO YOU'VE MANAGED
TO TURN YOUR COMPULSIONS

25:07.600 --> 25:09.500
INTO SOMETHING PRODUCTIVE.

25:09.533 --> 25:11.433
BUT WE'RE CUT
FROM THE SAME CLOTH.

25:11.467 --> 25:13.767
THAT'S WHY
YOU CAN'T STAND ME.

25:13.800 --> 25:16.267
OH, TIME TO GO.
BUT I'M NOT DONE.

25:16.300 --> 25:17.333
UH, YES, YOU ARE, SIR.

25:17.367 --> 25:19.067
HOW MANY DO YOU HAVE TO DO?
96.

25:19.067 --> 25:20.833
LET HIM FINISH.

25:20.867 --> 25:23.300
FINE. I'LL SEE YOU
IN THE O.R.

25:28.333 --> 25:31.333
(murmuring)

25:34.200 --> 25:37.067
HEY. OLLIE SAYS
YOU SHOULD COME IN.

25:37.100 --> 25:39.300
SHE SAYS YOU NEED
A MEETING.

25:39.333 --> 25:41.300
NOT NOW, NOT HERE.

25:41.333 --> 25:43.233
YEAH, EXCEPT
SHE SAID TO TELL YOU

25:43.267 --> 25:45.167
NOT TO PROTECT YOUR ANONYMITY
OVER YOUR SOBRIETY.

26:02.767 --> 26:04.700
(all except Richard) GOD...

26:04.733 --> 26:06.600
GRANT ME THE SERENITY

26:06.633 --> 26:09.733
TO ACCEPT THE THINGS
THAT I CANNOT CHANGE,

26:09.767 --> 26:12.767
(all) THE COURAGE TO CHANGE
THE THINGS I CAN

26:12.800 --> 26:16.700
AND THE WISDOM
TO KNOW THE DIFFERENCE.

26:16.733 --> 26:18.667
AMEN.
AMEN.

26:18.700 --> 26:21.400
AMEN.

26:26.067 --> 26:28.200
HEY.

26:28.233 --> 26:29.700
HOW ARE YOU FEELIN'?

26:29.733 --> 26:31.100
DO ME A FAVOR.

26:31.133 --> 26:34.167
MY WILL IS INSIDE
MY NIGHTSTAND.

26:34.200 --> 26:36.100
JUST MAKE SURE IT GETS
IN THE RIGHT HANDS, OKAY?

26:36.133 --> 26:38.067
WHY ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT YOUR WILL?

26:38.067 --> 26:41.533
WE HAVE TO BE REALISTIC,
DR. STEVENS.

26:41.567 --> 26:42.767
DR. STEVENS?

26:42.800 --> 26:45.467
WE GOTTA BE REALISTIC.

26:45.500 --> 26:48.333
AND IF YOU CAN'T,
WELL, I CAN.

26:48.367 --> 26:50.267
NO, WAIT. UM, CAN YOU
JUST WAIT ONE MINUTE?

26:50.300 --> 26:51.767
DENNY, DENNY,
LISTEN TO ME,

26:51.800 --> 26:53.700
YOU'RE NOT GONNA DIE.

26:53.733 --> 26:56.333
YOU CAN'T GO INTO SURGERY
THINKING YOU'RE GONNA DIE.

27:06.300 --> 27:09.500
(woman) CARDIOCATH
TO ROOM 1213.

27:09.533 --> 27:13.200
CARDIOCATH TO ROOM 1213.

27:14.367 --> 27:17.067
YOU WANT ME TO PEE IN FRONT
OF YOU? IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

27:17.100 --> 27:19.167
YOU HAVE IT ON YOU.
OH, REALLY,
YOU WANNA GO THERE?

27:19.200 --> 27:20.633
I WANNA GO THERE.
SO WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO, BAMBI?

27:20.667 --> 27:21.833
YOU GONNA, LIKE, WHAT,
TAKE IT FROM ME?

27:21.867 --> 27:23.767
WELL, BURKE SAID TO DO
WHATEVER I HAVE TO DO,

27:23.800 --> 27:26.100
AND I AM GONNA DO WHATEVER
I HAVE TO--
GEORGE, IT'S NOT THERE.

27:26.133 --> 27:27.733
IT'S NOT THERE.

27:27.767 --> 27:29.300
(toilet flushes)

27:29.333 --> 27:31.233
NO, YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET IT.
MAYBE IT'S IN HERE.

27:31.267 --> 27:33.267
YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET IT. NO.
I GOT IT. I GOT IT.

27:33.300 --> 27:35.200
OH, YOU'RE GETTING MY BREAST.
THAT'S MY BREAST, MY BREAST.

27:35.233 --> 27:37.133
MY BREAST.
THAT'S MY BREAST, DAMN IT.

27:37.167 --> 27:39.067
(water runs)

27:39.067 --> 27:40.267
(water turns off)

27:40.300 --> 27:42.767
HEY, DR. TORRES.

27:42.800 --> 27:45.067
DR. O'MALLEY, YOU'RE AWARE
THIS IS THE WOMEN'S RESTROOM?

27:45.067 --> 27:45.833
YES, MA'AM.

27:45.867 --> 27:47.767
GOOD.

27:51.100 --> 27:52.833
DUDE,
YOU CALLED HER "MA'AM."

27:52.867 --> 27:55.667
SHE'S NEVER GONNA SLEEP
WITH YOU NOW.

27:58.367 --> 28:00.233
OH, HEY.
OW.

28:00.267 --> 28:01.433
HAVE YOU SEEN BURKE?

28:01.467 --> 28:03.367
HE'S ON THE PHONE
WITH THE LAUNDRY.

28:03.400 --> 28:05.300
THEY STILL CAN'T FIND
HIS SCRUB CAPS.

28:05.333 --> 28:08.200
THAT'S WHAT I GOTTA TELL HIM.
CRISTINA WON'T GIVE HERS BACK.

28:08.233 --> 28:10.133
UNLESS I'M READY
TO HIT A WOMAN,

28:10.167 --> 28:11.667
AND EVEN THOUGH
IT'S CRISTINA,

28:11.700 --> 28:13.600
I'M NOT READY
TO CROSS THAT LINE.

28:13.633 --> 28:14.800
WAIT. WAIT A MOMENT.

28:14.833 --> 28:16.733
CRISTINA HAS ONE OF BURKE'S
SCRUB CAPS?

28:16.767 --> 28:18.433
SHE'S HOLDING IT HOSTAGE.

28:18.467 --> 28:20.467
WHY DO YOU THINK
I AM STALKING HER? Y--

28:28.233 --> 28:30.600
OW. OW.
YOU'RE TOUCHING ME.

28:30.633 --> 28:32.333
GEORGE SAYS YOU HAVE
BURKE'S SCRUB CAP.

28:32.367 --> 28:33.700
SO?
GIVE IT TO HIM.

28:33.733 --> 28:35.067
NO.
GIVE IT TO HIM, CRISTINA.

28:35.067 --> 28:37.067
WHAT IS WITH YOU?
HE NEEDS IT TO OPERATE.

28:37.067 --> 28:39.067
NO, HE DOESN'T.
THAT ISN'T YOUR DECISION
TO MAKE,

28:39.067 --> 28:40.800
NOT WHEN HE'S GOING IN
ON DENNY.

28:40.833 --> 28:42.733
NOW ARE YOU GONNA
GIVE IT TO HIM

28:42.767 --> 28:45.233
OR AM I GONNA PHYSICALLY
TAKE IT FROM YOU?

28:45.267 --> 28:46.533
ARE YOU THREATENING ME?

28:46.567 --> 28:49.433
I SWEAR TO GOD, CRISTINA,
I LIKE YOU, I REALLY DO,

28:49.467 --> 28:51.067
BUT I GREW UP
IN A TRAILER PARK,

28:51.100 --> 28:52.833
AND I AM NOT ABOVE KICKING

28:52.867 --> 28:54.767
YOUR PAMPERED LITTLE
BEVERLY HILLS ASS.

28:54.800 --> 28:56.700
AND I DO MEAN PHYSICALLY
KICKING YOUR ASS.

29:04.200 --> 29:07.200
(Cristina clears throat)

29:07.233 --> 29:10.267
YOU DON'T HAVE TO FOLLOW ME.

29:11.600 --> 29:14.233
AHEM.

29:14.267 --> 29:17.200
THANK YOU.

29:17.233 --> 29:19.133
HOW LONG
HAVE YOU HAD THIS?

29:19.167 --> 29:20.700
IT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITES.

29:20.733 --> 29:24.133
YOU KNOW,
YOU DON'T NEED IT.

29:24.167 --> 29:26.333
I KEEP THAT CAP IN MY LOCKER

29:26.367 --> 29:28.267
BECAUSE EVERY MORNING,
I LOOK AT IT,

29:28.300 --> 29:30.200
AND I'M REMINDED
OF WHAT I'M HERE FOR

29:30.233 --> 29:33.100
AND WHAT I WANT TO BE--
A GREAT SURGEON,

29:33.133 --> 29:36.133
A SURGEON WHO IS DECISIVE
AND WHO EXECUTES

29:36.167 --> 29:38.067
AND WHO DOESN'T NEED
A PIECE OF CLOTHING

29:38.100 --> 29:39.833
TO GIVE HIM AN EDGE
IN SURGERY.

29:39.867 --> 29:41.433
YOU DON'T NEED IT.

29:47.567 --> 29:50.067
I KNOW.

29:50.067 --> 29:52.067
YOU'RE RIGHT.

29:52.067 --> 29:54.333
I KNOW I'M RIGHT.

29:59.067 --> 30:01.600
NICELY DONE, O'MALLEY.
LET'S GO SCRUB IN.

30:07.067 --> 30:09.633
HOW AM I DOIN'?

30:09.667 --> 30:13.333
NIKKI, IS IT POSSIBLE
YOU'RE MISREADING THE SIGNS?

30:13.367 --> 30:14.533
I MEAN, ISN'T TWO SURGEONS

30:14.567 --> 30:16.633
TELLING YOU
THAT YOU NEED SURGERY

30:16.667 --> 30:19.600
A SIGN
THAT YOU NEED SURGERY?

30:19.633 --> 30:22.033
DID YOU CALL MY BOYFRIEND?

30:22.067 --> 30:23.067
I DID.

30:23.100 --> 30:25.467
WHAT DID HE SAY?

30:25.500 --> 30:29.567
HE SAID HE HASN'T BEEN
YOUR BOYFRIEND IN AWHILE.

30:34.500 --> 30:37.600
DID YOU TELL HIM
I GOT STRUCK BY LIGHTNING?

30:46.600 --> 30:48.433
WHAT DID YOU SAY TO HIM?
WHO?

30:48.467 --> 30:50.367
YOU KNOW WHO.
WHAT THE HELL?

30:50.400 --> 30:52.167
WHY DOES DENNY
THINK HE'S DYING?

30:52.200 --> 30:55.267
WELL, MAYBE 'CAUSE THERE'S
A GOOD CHANCE HE IS.

30:59.200 --> 31:01.100
