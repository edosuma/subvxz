02:39.006 --> 02:44.092
the castle armory was
basically empty, except for this.

02:44.416 --> 02:46.617
This is a Brakebills student workbook.

02:46.652 --> 02:49.419
I'm not blind, Quentin, technically.

02:49.455 --> 02:52.422
From 1893, so I guess that
means that a Brakebills student

02:52.458 --> 02:55.626
was in Fillory over a hundred years ago.

02:55.661 --> 02:58.128
And the only humans that had
access to the armory were...

02:58.163 --> 03:01.565
Own it, pumpkin. The Monarchy.

03:01.600 --> 03:04.301
So we are not the first
Brakebills students

03:04.336 --> 03:06.470
to get into Fillory
or to assume the throne.

03:06.505 --> 03:08.772
It's a great question for history class,

03:08.807 --> 03:11.842
but if The Beast gets to
the Wellspring right now

03:11.877 --> 03:15.445
and sucks it bone-dry,
magic dies in Fillory.

03:15.481 --> 03:19.082
- It dies there...
- It dies here.

03:19.118 --> 03:21.818
On Earth.

03:21.854 --> 03:23.353
My God.

03:23.389 --> 03:25.643
So the Battle Magic
that this student learned here,

03:25.668 --> 03:27.322
he learned from a professor named Bigby.

03:27.347 --> 03:29.593
- Have you heard of him?
- Her.

03:29.628 --> 03:33.050
Well, there is a note in here.

03:33.749 --> 03:35.665

03:35.701 --> 03:37.400
called the Rhinemann Ultra...

03:37.436 --> 03:39.436
Right, but the spell
isn't actually here.

03:39.471 --> 03:41.304

25:16.763 --> 25:19.089
"Somer... Somerset. Somerset."

25:19.114 --> 25:20.284
Somerset.

25:20.309 --> 25:21.714
And the numbers could be
a street address.

25:21.739 --> 25:23.538
Right.

25:23.736 --> 25:27.335
"Quick as one, two, nine.
Middle is first, last is fine."

25:28.041 --> 25:32.113
219. So it's 219 something Somerset.

25:43.723 --> 25:46.657
Oh, come on.

25:48.761 --> 25:52.563
[breathing rapidly]

25:52.599 --> 25:55.399
[grunts]

25:55.435 --> 25:57.421
I think I can help.

25:57.804 --> 25:59.737
[scoffs]

26:01.824 --> 26:03.152
- Sorry, sir.
- Yes?

26:03.177 --> 26:05.110
We've had a security breach.

26:15.056 --> 26:16.658
Marina.

26:16.822 --> 26:18.967
Please.

26:20.310 --> 26:22.396
I need asylum.

26:27.116 --> 26:29.132
Marina.

26:29.452 --> 26:32.593
What else can you tell me about this...

26:32.848 --> 26:34.624
situation?

26:43.966 --> 26:47.247
Well, for starters,
it's not a "situation."

26:47.437 --> 26:49.437
It's a raping, killing, omniscient god

26:49.462 --> 26:52.886
with a pretty specific type:
me and mine.

26:53.743 --> 26:55.376
What the fuck else do you need to know?

26:55.411 --> 26:58.245
I see you still don't
expend much on good manners.

26:58.270 --> 26:59.547
What, this is a charm school now?

26:59.582 --> 27:02.239
No, but it is my school.

27:02.418 --> 27:04.184
Not a safe house.

27:04.454 --> 27:06.645
I was the best student
you ever had here.

27:06.789 --> 27:08.265
You said that.

27:08.290 --> 27:10.735
I confused talent with character.

27:10.760 --> 27:13.794
You need both
to be a true magician, Marina.

27:13.830 --> 27:15.985
Kicking you out wasn't a choice.

27:16.132 --> 27:18.074
I couldn't have you
infecting my students then

27:18.099 --> 27:20.233
and I certainly won't now.

27:24.307 --> 27:26.996
[scoffs]

27:27.844 --> 27:30.230
You fucking prick.

27:32.315 --> 27:34.994
- Where am I supposed to go?
- You can keep your memories.

27:35.019 --> 27:38.285
I hope that whatever you've
learned here will help keep you safe.

27:38.431 --> 27:40.621
What I learned here will get me killed.

27:57.306 --> 28:00.256
Remember, pixies are tricky.

28:00.510 --> 28:03.310
Keep all questions and answers
short and to the point.

28:03.346 --> 28:05.084
- You understand?
- Henry.

28:05.181 --> 28:07.951
- Ah, yes.
- Henry, you look awful.

28:08.117 --> 28:09.850
What happened to your eyes?
Are you blind?

28:09.886 --> 28:12.436
And your... your hair.
Henry, you look ancient.

28:12.461 --> 28:14.188
Very nice of you to say so, dear.

28:14.223 --> 28:15.641
Oh, no wonder you sought me out.

28:15.666 --> 28:19.225
I mean, you've been
positively mauled by something.

28:19.250 --> 28:20.698
Bigby, let me intro...

28:21.469 --> 28:24.026
Mmm. [chuckles]

28:24.575 --> 28:26.378
Some things haven't changed.

28:26.403 --> 28:30.208
You still are the most wonderful kisser.

28:30.572 --> 28:31.939
Do you have time to go to bed with me?

28:31.974 --> 28:34.875
We are a bit on the clock, darling.

28:34.911 --> 28:36.756
And these are my students.

28:36.781 --> 28:38.340
They are in need of the Rhinemann Ultra.

28:38.365 --> 28:39.840
- [chuckles] Are they now?
- Oh, yes.

28:39.865 --> 28:41.949
Well, if the stuffed shirts
and ninny nay-sayers

28:41.984 --> 28:44.351
hadn't outlawed Battle Magic
38 years ago,

28:44.520 --> 28:47.621
then they would have it,
which you well know, Henry.

28:50.593 --> 28:52.593
You look hungry.

28:54.230 --> 28:56.397
So why was Battle Magic outlawed?

28:56.465 --> 29:00.475
[sighs] Humans least
attractive qualities.

29:00.903 --> 29:03.874
Panic and paranoia.

29:04.040 --> 29:06.973
And there were several student
deaths that semester.

29:07.109 --> 29:09.620
Far fewer than the 1870s,

29:09.645 --> 29:11.941
or the 1920s, or the '60s.

29:12.348 --> 29:14.949
Another human failing, short memory.

29:17.753 --> 29:19.377
Hmm.

29:19.855 --> 29:22.752
You'd be the one casting. Good.

29:22.925 --> 29:25.619
It would burn anyone else to a crisp.

29:26.596 --> 29:29.958
I can feel your power. It's almost...

29:30.233 --> 29:33.769
[chuckles]
it's almost god-like.

29:33.794 --> 29:35.167
Did you fuck one of them?

29:35.192 --> 29:37.438
I mean, they are wonderful, aren't they?

29:37.473 --> 29:38.706
At least mine was.

29:38.741 --> 29:41.683
I glowed for weeks. No, literally.

29:41.708 --> 29:43.611
I actually got mine
a little differently.

29:43.646 --> 29:46.413
Yes, and it's waning. Quite quickly.

29:46.536 --> 29:48.916
And so, Bigby, if you could
just please give us the spell.

29:48.951 --> 29:51.934
I don't give anything, Henry.
You of all people know that.

29:52.817 --> 29:54.519
So...

29:54.816 --> 29:57.112
- well, convince me.
- [sighs]

29:59.161 --> 30:02.263
Where the hell is the Burnt River?

30:04.567 --> 30:08.725
Apologies for last night, dear wife.

30:08.878 --> 30:11.669
None required, my lord.

30:11.907 --> 30:15.396
I will need to find some way
to blow off steam.

30:15.489 --> 30:17.978
Somehow, someday. But in the meantime,

30:18.014 --> 30:21.826
I get to stroll
the wondrous memory fields

30:21.851 --> 30:24.185
of my agrarian childhood...

30:24.647 --> 30:27.069
sprinkling shit.

30:28.457 --> 30:30.631
Sprinkling... shit?

30:30.656 --> 30:33.394
Shoveling, mixing, drying, hauling.

30:33.429 --> 30:34.895
Sorry.

30:34.930 --> 30:37.624
Sprinkling it on... what?

30:38.352 --> 30:40.552
Crops.

30:40.870 --> 30:42.519
Oh.

30:42.838 --> 30:45.042
Fertilizer?

30:46.765 --> 30:49.710
Your farmers don't fertilize?

30:53.920 --> 30:57.092
So it's the only thing we've
found that might stop The Beast.

30:57.117 --> 30:59.131
I mean, it was amazing reading about how

30:59.156 --> 31:01.951
you used the Rhinemann at Gettysburg
to help win the war for the Union.

31:01.976 --> 31:04.646
Right. And it was you
who slipped it to Rupert Chatwin

31:04.664 --> 31:06.397
for the Battle of the Bulge.

31:06.433 --> 31:07.832
I mean, you changed history.

31:07.857 --> 31:10.434
Oh, I did, yes. Many times.

31:11.671 --> 31:15.278
Henry, is that juniper tree still there?

31:15.442 --> 31:17.800
You know, the one by the infirmary.

31:18.011 --> 31:22.280
- Oh, yes.
- Oh, it has the softest grass.

31:22.315 --> 31:24.573
It feels delicious on your ass.

31:24.684 --> 31:26.417
I mean, we used to sneak out
at night and,

31:26.453 --> 31:29.650
- oh, for hours we would...
- Bigby, please.

31:29.675 --> 31:32.190
Are you telling me you don't
even remember that tree?

31:32.225 --> 31:34.926
Of course I do, darling. Of course.

31:34.961 --> 31:36.794
- But it's private.
- [laughing]

31:36.830 --> 31:38.789
Well, not anymore.

31:38.814 --> 31:41.086
Plus, these two fuck like jackrabbits.

31:41.111 --> 31:42.774
I mean, you can just smell it.

31:42.875 --> 31:45.436
- Ahem.
- And it is delicious, darling.

31:45.472 --> 31:47.776
Bigby, we really are in a time crunch.

31:47.801 --> 31:48.987
- Mm-hmm.
- There's a lot at stake.

31:49.012 --> 31:51.876
Which I told you
would be the case someday, hmm.

31:52.050 --> 31:54.620
Well, welcome to someday.

31:54.714 --> 31:56.814

By the time I'm fully powered up,

33:37.136 --> 33:38.877
The Beast will have eaten
all of our faces off.

33:38.920 --> 33:42.288
You all are going to need
something strong to hit him with.

33:42.519 --> 33:44.557
Bigby isn't the only one

33:44.769 --> 33:47.386

34:06.438 --> 34:08.407
I can't pronounce the name.

34:08.683 --> 34:10.216
It's from China.

34:10.342 --> 34:12.375
It'll keep the blood circulating,

Still, if there's anything
I can do for you, let me know.

I don't think you're in
a position to do much.

35:35.203 --> 35:36.920

you what I'm gonna tell you.

Okay, fine. Don't.

36:13.641 --> 36:15.878
I just... I-I have to warn you.

36:17.278 --> 36:19.178
You could die if you don't
get clear of The Beast.

36:19.213 --> 36:20.913
You think I don't know
how dangerous he is?

36:20.948 --> 36:24.083
No, not him. Us.
We're going to kill him.

I-I need you to see
that this is bigger than you.

36:36.697 --> 36:38.731
The Beast,
he's killing magic everywhere.

36:38.766 --> 36:40.402
And Reynard is killing
people everywhere.

36:40.427 --> 36:41.685
Do you think that that's less important?

36:41.710 --> 36:44.838
No, I just think that what
you want here is revenge and...

36:44.863 --> 36:46.624
And you don't?

36:49.054 --> 36:52.355
Just don't be within
20 feet of The Beast

There's something.

He... he made some kind of joke.

39:58.105 --> 40:00.233
- your voice again?
- Good.

40:00.258 --> 40:02.425
Now for the painful part.

40:02.471 --> 40:04.214
That wasn't the painful part?

40:04.239 --> 40:07.350
Oh, no. Professor Li?

40:24.293 --> 40:27.227
[chittering]

40:28.662 --> 40:31.460
This is a Cacodemon.

40:31.866 --> 40:33.733
- Jesus.
- They'll grow much bigger.

40:33.819 --> 40:37.270
Unleash these and believe me,
they'll keep The Beast plenty busy.

40:37.460 --> 40:41.429
Each of you will be given a special word
to command your Cacodemon to attack.

40:41.652 --> 40:43.618
They're a one-shot weapon,

40:43.643 --> 40:45.476
so pick your moment with care.

40:45.647 --> 40:48.435
What are you, uh, gonna do with it?

40:49.117 --> 40:51.885
Lift your shirt, Quentin,
and turn around.

40:51.920 --> 40:53.286
Oh.

40:53.428 --> 40:55.756
Those words never led to anything good.

40:55.924 --> 40:58.272
Well, almost never.

40:58.594 --> 41:01.528
- [chittering]
- [screaming]

41:06.835 --> 41:09.769
[screaming]

41:11.473 --> 41:13.301
[panting]

41:13.401 --> 41:15.368
Right, next.

41:20.249 --> 41:23.560
Sire, it's working.

41:23.683 --> 41:25.404
Oh, great.

41:25.731 --> 41:28.732
- Mm, thank you.
- Thank you, my King.

41:29.291 --> 41:32.292
No, no. Thank the hell
that was my childhood.

41:32.327 --> 41:34.427
[whooshing]

41:37.432 --> 41:39.318
Oh, well, [clears throat]

41:39.501 --> 41:42.185
perfect timing, for once.

41:42.734 --> 41:44.667
[clears throat]

41:47.809 --> 41:51.516
Your High King has agricultural
tales to tell.

41:51.947 --> 41:54.812
I give you the reign of...

41:55.384 --> 41:57.002
King Shit.

41:57.886 --> 42:00.338
[knocking]

42:01.288 --> 42:04.495
I figured you'd pretty much
be dead without me, so...
