WEBVTT

00:02.240 --> 00:05.949
<i>Today's gonna be a great day.</i>
<i>Still, no time to dilly-dally.</i>

00:06.040 --> 00:09.350
<i>God, that's a fun phrase.</i>
<i>I have to meet Dr Cox in five...</i>

00:10.040 --> 00:12.838
<i>Good God, check out those dilly-dallies.</i>

00:13.800 --> 00:16.553
<i>That may be the future Mrs...</i>

00:17.600 --> 00:21.752
<i>OK, back to work. Dr Cox has selected</i>
<i>me to help him on a research project.</i>

00:21.840 --> 00:22.989
Hey, research buddy.

00:23.080 --> 00:27.073
We're four seconds in and
I'm already regretting my decision.

00:27.160 --> 00:29.549
Things Jordan says during sex!

00:29.640 --> 00:31.915
- Are those the charts I wanted?
- No...

00:32.000 --> 00:36.152
They're the charts, plus patient history
charts from the last ten years

00:36.240 --> 00:40.279
which yours truly stayed up all night
organising not only chronologically

00:40.360 --> 00:42.669
but by severity of condition.

00:46.080 --> 00:48.833
There's a good chance
I'm gonna kill someone.

00:48.920 --> 00:51.309
Things you say
when you talk to your patients.

00:51.400 --> 00:54.551
- Clever.
- Don't bother with that.

00:54.640 --> 00:58.519
I've been getting my hair cut
by my barber for 17 years now.

00:58.600 --> 01:01.433
Is it because his prices
have remained the same? No.

01:01.520 --> 01:04.034
Is it because
I like the way his man-breasts feel

01:04.120 --> 01:08.193
gently resting on my shoulders when
he does my sideburns? A little. Yes.

01:08.280 --> 01:14.389
But mainly it's because, unlike you, he
does just exactly what I tell him to do.

01:14.480 --> 01:16.357
It's either my way or the highway

01:16.440 --> 01:19.716
and since as you've already
broken that dictum, you're out.

01:19.800 --> 01:23.076
No, wait! I already got my shifts
covered for the next two days.

01:23.160 --> 01:25.879
Where will you find somebody else?
You think Lonnie

01:25.960 --> 01:29.635
gives a rat's ass about acute
thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura?

01:29.720 --> 01:34.157
- ATTP? It killed my father.
- You're in.

01:34.720 --> 01:39.350
It is gonna be so amazing working on
the disease that tore my family apart.

01:40.440 --> 01:42.351
Kiss ass.

01:43.040 --> 01:47.113
<i>I guess I could go home, but there's</i>
<i>important stuff to do around here.</i>

01:47.200 --> 01:50.988
Laverne, what would you give me if
I get this jellybean in your cleavage?

01:51.080 --> 01:52.798
A concussion.

01:52.880 --> 01:56.555
Three long years of busting my hump here
and it has finally paid off.

01:56.640 --> 02:00.758
- You got the fellowship?
- I get to be the clown in Paediatrics.

02:00.840 --> 02:05.391
Hey, that old clown was really good, so,
you got some really big shoes to fill.

02:08.800 --> 02:10.711
Dammit, I'm funny.

02:12.800 --> 02:16.395
- Yes, he hits it at the buzzer!
- Oh, no, he didn't.

02:21.680 --> 02:23.591
<i>Not worth it.</i>

02:26.080 --> 02:29.436
My tongue is dry. How many more
of these invites do I have to lick?

02:29.520 --> 02:32.830
- Fine, don't lick them.
- <i>Come on, don't get mad at Turk.</i>

02:32.920 --> 02:35.115
<i>What's bugging me</i>
<i>is that thanks to Dr Cox</i>

02:35.200 --> 02:40.513
<i>I've got nothing to do. Nothing</i>
<i>to talk about. No stories to tell.</i>

02:40.600 --> 02:44.798
<i>I woke up this morning</i>
<i>freaking out about getting married.</i>

02:44.880 --> 02:47.030
<i>Luckily, Carla's being cool.</i>

02:47.120 --> 02:50.749
Last chance to un-invite that slut
you went out with in high school.

02:50.840 --> 02:53.400
- She's my brother's wife.
- That's convenient.

02:53.480 --> 02:56.790
<i>Thank God she thinks that hot chick Tina</i>
<i>I invited is my cousin.</i>

02:56.880 --> 02:59.348
<i>Guess what?</i>
<i>There's no blood there, baby.</i>

02:59.440 --> 03:03.319
And by the way, don't think
for a second that your "cousin" Tina

03:03.400 --> 03:05.311
is gonna be sitting at our table.

03:05.400 --> 03:09.473
<i>Oh, my God she's in my head.</i>
<i>It's OK. Use it to your advantage.</i>

03:09.960 --> 03:12.554
<i>Make me a grilled cheese sandwich,</i>
<i>woman.</i>

03:12.640 --> 03:14.551
Make it yourself.

03:16.000 --> 03:22.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:29.240 --> 03:31.834
- Thanks for driving me to work.
- Are you kidding?

03:31.920 --> 03:33.831
I wanted to see the invites mailed.

03:33.920 --> 03:36.992
Once you drop those suckers in
there's no turning back.

03:37.080 --> 03:41.073
I'm just mad I forgot my camera.
Or did I?

03:41.600 --> 03:44.114
Say goodbye to being single.

03:46.920 --> 03:50.390
- It's OK, just drop them in here.
- I don't wanna.

03:50.480 --> 03:52.436
If you're nervous, come here

03:52.520 --> 03:56.877
and I'll tell you a secret
that'll make you feel better. Come here.

03:56.960 --> 04:00.032
Give me those damn things, you coward!

04:04.640 --> 04:07.473
Sean, I might not
be able to do the clown thing today.

04:07.560 --> 04:11.394
But what about that summer
I spent at clown academy?

04:11.480 --> 04:14.870
It's starting to seem
like that was a giant waste of time.

04:14.960 --> 04:19.192
I wish you were here. I can't believe
you've been away for five months.

04:19.279 --> 04:22.511
I can't believe you haven't
figured out the time difference.

04:22.600 --> 04:25.478
- It's four am here.
- <i>I'm sor</i> ry.

04:25.560 --> 04:28.996
It's just I miss talking to you.
I miss seeing you. I even miss

04:29.080 --> 04:31.514
that weird way
you sleep with your eyes open.

04:34.400 --> 04:36.755
<i>Sean? Sean?</i>

04:36.840 --> 04:39.877
<i>Damn, Elliot's got a nice ass</i>
<i>for a white chick.</i>

04:39.960 --> 04:42.190
<i>Stop it. Just cos you're panicked</i>

04:42.280 --> 04:45.670
<i>you don't have to reduce eve</i> ry <i>woman</i>
<i>to her physical attributes.</i>

04:45.760 --> 04:50.197
<i>Great. My new sca</i> ry <i>boss,</i>
<i>and her amazing chest, butt and feet.</i>

04:50.800 --> 04:52.711
<i>I love feet.</i>

04:52.800 --> 04:56.952
Dr Turk, this is Brian. You'll be
assisting me on his tumour debulking.

04:57.040 --> 05:00.077
Whoa-hoa, Bri-Bri?
You have just won the lottery.

05:00.160 --> 05:03.948
I'm not saying I'm good but if there
was a surgeon award show around here,

05:04.040 --> 05:06.873
it'd be called The Turkies.
You know what I'm saying?

05:06.960 --> 05:10.999
You don't have to know what he's saying.
None of us do.

05:11.080 --> 05:12.991
May I have a quick moment? Excuse us.

05:13.080 --> 05:14.991
<i>What now, you mean witch?</i>

05:15.080 --> 05:18.516
If you act like that
in front of one of our patients again,

05:18.600 --> 05:21.034
I'll spend the next ten years
introducing you

05:21.120 --> 05:25.079
as the guy who sponges off my forehead.
OK, we're done.

05:25.160 --> 05:27.674
Brian, Dr Turk
will take you back to your room.

05:27.760 --> 05:29.671
- That was glorious.
- OK.

05:32.680 --> 05:35.911
- Did you mind that cocky stuff?
- No. I love Bri-Bri.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.911
I never had a nickname before.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.434
There's more
where that came from, Killer B.

05:43.160 --> 05:45.310
I thought you had two days off.

05:45.400 --> 05:47.277
I had to pick up a mouth guard.

05:47.360 --> 05:50.909
Some kids at the park said I couldn't
jump Jones Creek on my bicycle.

05:51.000 --> 05:54.788
So now I gotta give them
the 411 on my mad daredeviling skills.

05:54.880 --> 05:56.598
Meanwhile, back in adult world,

05:56.680 --> 06:00.798
I was just given 12 new admits so
I can't be a clown for the kids today.

06:05.080 --> 06:07.833
If it helps,
I could examine her for you.

06:07.920 --> 06:11.595
Elliot, please!
That hurt through my helmet.

06:13.200 --> 06:16.590
Mrs Bell, your EKG showed
an irregularity but nothing serious.

06:16.680 --> 06:19.831
Maybe when my husband hears that,
he'll stop worrying.

06:19.920 --> 06:21.194
Hey, honey.

06:21.280 --> 06:25.034
Oh, and this must be your hobbit...
I mean 'husband', of course.

06:25.120 --> 06:29.159
I rented <i>Lord of the Rings</i>
last night so... I would do Frodo.

06:29.240 --> 06:31.549
Maybe. He's short too.

06:34.040 --> 06:40.115
Dr Miller, I am attending a hospital
administrators' luncheon this afternoon.

06:40.200 --> 06:43.829
- I would love for you to join me.
- Not so fast there, Bob.

06:43.920 --> 06:46.354
You forgot to affix your warning label.

06:46.440 --> 06:50.353
The one that reads "Exposure To Bob
Kelso Can Be Hazardous To Your Health,"

06:50.440 --> 06:54.399
thus affording the reader a chance
to escape the waste and contamination

06:54.480 --> 06:57.074
that is Bob Kelso.

06:57.160 --> 06:59.879
Gosh darn it, Perry,
you are entertaining.

06:59.960 --> 07:03.396
You know, like Howie Mandel
or a monkey in a funny hat.

07:03.480 --> 07:06.119
Check out Cox and Kelso
fighting over Dr New Girl.

07:08.360 --> 07:11.079
- Bobby, give me a break.
- Like you'll get near this.

07:11.160 --> 07:13.037
She's mine!

07:19.360 --> 07:22.033
She'll have to get a car
you drive with your feet.

07:22.120 --> 07:24.031
Dr Miller, I hope to see you later.

07:26.960 --> 07:30.839
Look, I like you.
So here's some advice.

07:30.920 --> 07:34.469
Never, ever, do anything with Bob Kelso.

07:34.560 --> 07:37.870
Don't talk to him,
don't even associate with guys his age

07:37.960 --> 07:40.394
in case
they just shared a steam together

07:40.480 --> 07:44.792
in that never-ending Klan meeting
they call a country club. All right?

07:45.720 --> 07:48.439
He is pure evil.

07:48.520 --> 07:52.638
I'll remember that. Not the crazy,
"where-is-he-going-with-this" ranting

07:52.720 --> 07:56.315
but, you know, the gist:
The "Bob Kelso bad" part.

07:56.400 --> 07:58.311
Fair enough.

08:00.320 --> 08:03.630
Nurse Espinosa, would you mind
getting me some sugar, stat?

08:03.720 --> 08:05.676
Why, yes, doctor.

08:10.360 --> 08:14.478
Wow! This hospital rocks.
Did you two just meet?

08:14.560 --> 08:18.473
- No, we're getting married.
- The invitations went out today.

08:18.560 --> 08:22.473
Yes. You know they did.
Invitations went out today.

08:23.600 --> 08:27.115
- No, they didn't.
- I could never get a girl like that.

08:27.200 --> 08:28.189
Why?

08:28.280 --> 08:31.397
Girls don't usually
go for the piano-playing power geek.

08:31.480 --> 08:34.916
Are you a good pianist?
<i>Pianist.</i>

08:35.000 --> 08:37.070
Yeah, I got a scholarship to Juilliard.

08:37.159 --> 08:40.596
Bri-Bri, you're in the money.
Girls love the artsy type.

08:40.679 --> 08:45.390
You'll be getting more tail
than you know what to do with.

08:45.480 --> 08:47.471
Tail is sex, Brian.

08:49.080 --> 08:50.399
Awesome.

08:52.040 --> 08:56.192
OK, so how far
over the creek did you make it?

08:56.280 --> 08:59.636
I don't know the exact distance
in terms of feet and inches,

08:59.720 --> 09:03.349
but in layman's terms
I would have to say about halfway.

09:03.440 --> 09:06.591
Annie, you are a shoo-in
for the little girl X-Games.

09:06.680 --> 09:09.399
Anyone seen Dr Kelso?
We're supposed to be leaving.

09:09.480 --> 09:13.678
That's strange. I remember having
a conversation with you about this.

09:13.760 --> 09:16.957
"Never do anything with him, pure evil."
Ringing any bells?

09:17.040 --> 09:19.349
Just the one that goes off
when I'm bored.

09:19.440 --> 09:22.796
People usually don't stop caring
about what you have to say

09:22.880 --> 09:26.111
till they've been here a few months.
"Oh, no, he didn't."

09:27.120 --> 09:30.715
- That's the correct use of that phrase?
- I don't know, sir.

09:35.280 --> 09:37.157
"Oh, no, he didn't."

09:57.560 --> 09:59.790
- Mrs Bell...
- How did I end up with him?

10:00.120 --> 10:05.194
Yes. See, I've got this boyfriend,
except he's all the way in New Zealand

10:05.280 --> 10:09.956
and, well, how did you know
Mr Bell was the right guy for you?

10:10.040 --> 10:12.508
Kurt was the one
that was always there for me.

10:12.600 --> 10:15.433
And at the end of the day,
that's who you want.

10:15.520 --> 10:19.513
The guy who shows up when you
need him, without having to ask.

10:19.600 --> 10:23.639
Dr Reid couldn't be here today,
children, so I'm here in her place.

10:23.720 --> 10:26.757
Why are your pants so tight?
Clowns have baggy pants.

10:26.840 --> 10:30.992
Well, Brad, I'm the type of clown
that likes to wear tight pants.

10:31.080 --> 10:33.389
But the other clown has baggy pants.

10:33.480 --> 10:35.550
What other clown?

10:37.960 --> 10:39.837
Hello, old friend.

10:41.640 --> 10:43.915
Janitor.

10:44.760 --> 10:47.672
<i>The way Dr Miller stares,</i>
<i>it makes me all itchy.</i>

10:47.760 --> 10:50.069
<i>What can I say</i>
<i>to let her know I'm in control?</i>

10:51.440 --> 10:55.399
- Have you ever slept with a black man?
- Just finish the procedure.

10:55.480 --> 11:00.156
<i>That's a yes. And now her mind</i>
<i>will drift back to that wonderful day.</i>

11:00.240 --> 11:02.151
<i>Wait for it.</i>

11:02.760 --> 11:04.671
<i>And there it is.</i>

11:04.760 --> 11:10.357
Dr Miller, feel free to drift off.
Although there is a lot of bleeding.

11:10.840 --> 11:14.276
You lacerated the brachial artery.
Move out of the way.

11:18.240 --> 11:21.038
You made a mistake.
Every one of us has made a mistake.

11:21.120 --> 11:23.918
Consider yourself lucky.
Instead of losing his arm,

11:24.000 --> 11:27.515
he'll just have some nerve damage
and limited use of his right hand.

11:27.600 --> 11:32.390
It could have been a lot worse.
If you want, I'll even tell him for you.

11:34.240 --> 11:36.196
He's a concert pianist.

11:37.560 --> 11:39.471
You tell him.

11:46.200 --> 11:48.873
<i>Just go in there and get it over with.</i>

11:49.400 --> 11:55.157
- Hey, Bri-Bri, what's the happy-haps?
- My hand is feeling really weird.

11:56.040 --> 11:57.917
About that...

11:58.000 --> 12:01.515
<i>I made a mistake.</i>
<i>Just say it, "I made a mistake."</i>

12:02.960 --> 12:08.353
I'm not really too sure on the specifics
but there were some complications.

12:08.440 --> 12:10.351
<i>You big chicken.</i>

12:12.640 --> 12:14.995
You are looking slim.
Are those new scrubs

12:15.080 --> 12:18.755
or is it that you no longer have a soul?
Kelso wanted you at that dinner

12:18.840 --> 12:21.274
cos he knows
standing next to a pre <i>tty</i> doctor

12:21.360 --> 12:26.229
will get him in the medical journals.
Assuming his image shows up in photos.

12:26.320 --> 12:31.030
Publicity is good for the hospital.
Plus, pictures of us together

12:31.120 --> 12:34.590
lend credence to the rumours
that you and I are having a fling.

12:34.680 --> 12:36.591
I'm joking. There are no rumours.

12:39.120 --> 12:44.877
Cox wants you on his side. Until that
happens, he's gonna be all over you.

12:45.760 --> 12:47.671
- Maybe he's right.
- Get out of here.

12:47.760 --> 12:50.354
You're in with Kelso now.
But he will turn on you

12:50.440 --> 12:52.829
the minute you say no to him
on anything.

12:53.280 --> 12:59.230
Dr Miller, would you care to accompany
me to the Proctology Dinner tonight?

12:59.320 --> 13:01.880
Yeah! Would you?

13:01.960 --> 13:04.520
I don't know yet.

13:06.040 --> 13:10.670
I've never made balloon animals, but
raise your hand if you like your eels.

13:12.360 --> 13:16.239
- You're a horrible clown.
- Save it for the post-show, Lurch.

13:20.160 --> 13:25.029
Angry Disturbed Clown is trying to
teach us that it's never funny to push.

13:27.920 --> 13:31.037
- Dr Dorian?
- OK, let's take a little break, kids.

13:33.160 --> 13:35.958
Mr Milliken died
and his family needs to be notified.

13:36.040 --> 13:38.998
And since I'm new at this,
I was hoping you could do it.

13:39.080 --> 13:42.755
You steal my research project and
now you want me to do your dirty work?

13:42.840 --> 13:46.628
Dr Cox told me if you said that,
to say, "That's right, Melinda".

13:51.120 --> 13:53.634
How you doing?

13:53.720 --> 13:57.838
I've never screwed up a kid's life
before. I've had minor slip-ups.

13:57.920 --> 14:03.358
That watch you gave me might still be
inside Mr Conti, but nothing like this.

14:03.440 --> 14:08.434
That watch is inside Mr Conti? Thank,
God. I thought you didn't like it.

14:08.520 --> 14:13.469
But we're talking about you.
You, honey, you did a courageous thing.

14:13.560 --> 14:16.916
You took responsibility
for your actions, right?

14:17.360 --> 14:19.271
<i>No, I didn't.</i>

14:19.680 --> 14:21.318
Yes, I did.

14:21.400 --> 14:25.757
You're just upset because it's
never easy to give someone bad news.

14:25.840 --> 14:30.152
Unfortunately, your grandfather's
bowel burst causing a severe sepsis.

14:30.240 --> 14:34.233
We were unable to save him.
I'm so sorry.

14:37.080 --> 14:39.958
Again, I'm very sorry.

14:41.680 --> 14:47.357
- JD, what are you doing?
- Breaking some bad news, circus style.

14:47.440 --> 14:50.000
You were a clown for me?

14:53.200 --> 14:55.395
Break's over, Binky.

14:55.480 --> 14:57.391
The show must go on.

15:01.480 --> 15:04.472
<i>So I didn't tell him.</i>
<i>It's not like it changes anything.</i>

15:04.560 --> 15:05.709
Christopher!

15:05.800 --> 15:09.190
Christopher? You only call me
Christopher when you're mad

15:09.280 --> 15:12.511
or when we're having sex.

15:12.600 --> 15:14.670
Are you mad when we're having sex?

15:14.760 --> 15:17.672
Sometimes.
Come, let's take a walk.

15:18.200 --> 15:21.590
<i>This is bad.</i>
<i>OK, what did I do? Think.</i>

15:21.680 --> 15:24.399
<i>I got her a present</i>
<i>on my ex-girlfriend's birthday.</i>

15:24.480 --> 15:27.358
<i>I called that new cute nurse</i>
<i>a "young Carla Espinosa",</i>

15:27.440 --> 15:28.998
<i>Damn, that was stupid.</i>

15:29.080 --> 15:31.799
<i>I've left my toenail clippings</i>
<i>on her throw pillow.</i>

15:31.880 --> 15:35.190
<i>I forgot to put the toilet seat down</i>
<i>and she bruised her butt.</i>

15:35.280 --> 15:38.238
<i>Wow, why is she mar</i> ry <i>ing me?</i>
<i>Mar</i> ry <i>ing me!</i>

15:38.800 --> 15:41.360
<i>She knows I haven't mailed the invites.</i>

15:41.440 --> 15:44.637
I thought you might wanna talk to Brian
before you went home.

15:44.720 --> 15:48.554
- How'd you know?
- Who are you talking to?

15:49.880 --> 15:51.791
- Get in there.
- OK.

15:52.880 --> 15:56.873
Brian,
I got a confession to make, man.

15:58.240 --> 16:00.959
There's my dinner buddy.
Shall we head out?

16:01.040 --> 16:03.873
No, I'm not going. I have a date.

16:03.960 --> 16:07.430
And I don't wanna go to a snooze-fest
with a bunch of proctologists

16:07.520 --> 16:10.398
just so you can get your picture
in <i>Bendover Weekly.</i>

16:10.480 --> 16:12.630
A simple "I'm busy" would have sufficed.

16:12.720 --> 16:14.631
Big boys don't cry there, Bob-O.

16:16.160 --> 16:19.072
- Why are you smiling?
- I'm glad you wound up in my camp.

16:19.160 --> 16:22.436
I don't go to camp.
If Kelso had asked me to go somewhere

16:22.520 --> 16:25.273
I thought was good for my career,
I'd be gone so fast

16:25.360 --> 16:28.955
you'd be left here staring
at an imaginary woman's chest.

16:29.480 --> 16:34.838
I'm sorry, it's my fault. That dress
just screams "respect me as a doctor."

16:34.920 --> 16:37.514
You paint Dr Kelso
as a jackass who turns on people

16:37.600 --> 16:41.593
who don't do his bidding, when you were
writing me off just for having lunch.

16:41.680 --> 16:43.989
So, how are you any different?

16:44.680 --> 16:47.069
I'm taller than he is.

16:47.160 --> 16:49.071
Feel free to watch me leave.

16:53.880 --> 16:57.509
<i>It's weird, just by the simple act</i>
<i>of pushing me to do the right thing,</i>

16:57.600 --> 17:02.993
<i>I remembered why Carla's the woman</i>
<i>I wanna spend the rest of my life with.</i>

17:03.080 --> 17:04.991
<i>End of sto</i> ry.

17:05.560 --> 17:07.471
You did it.

17:10.960 --> 17:12.837
<i>What a long day.</i>

17:14.640 --> 17:16.311
<i>Still, any day can be salvaged</i>

17:16.400 --> 17:19.073
<i>by drinking a few cold ones</i>
<i>with a good friend.</i>

17:19.160 --> 17:21.674
Awesome, <i>Judge Dredd</i> is starting.

17:22.880 --> 17:24.790
You still have clown make-up on you.

17:24.880 --> 17:26.790
Elliot, The Judge, please.

17:27.319 --> 17:29.231
Fine, I'll get it.

17:33.120 --> 17:35.315
<i>What the hell is she doing?</i>
<i>It's the Judge?</i>

17:52.600 --> 17:56.673
- I can't find the clasp.
- I switched to frontsies.

17:56.760 --> 17:58.671
Naughty.

18:00.360 --> 18:02.271
Position one, two or three?

18:03.440 --> 18:05.351
- We only had two.
- Oh, yeah.

18:06.600 --> 18:09.160
Well,
I have something to show you later.

18:19.320 --> 18:23.279
<i>It's a myste</i> ry <i>how one woman</i>
<i>can drive you crazy over and over again.</i>

18:28.240 --> 18:31.312
<i>While another can bring you</i>
<i>right back down to earth.</i>

18:34.200 --> 18:36.350
<i>You have to trust that the perfect woman</i>

18:36.440 --> 18:38.795
<i>will always lead you</i>
<i>in the right direction.</i>

18:38.880 --> 18:41.519
So, did you get the guts
to mail the invitations?

18:44.160 --> 18:48.153
Look, Elliot, I don't wanna jinx this,
but how did that just happen?

18:48.240 --> 18:50.071
You were a clown for me.

18:50.160 --> 18:53.391
You were there when I needed you
without me even having to ask.

18:58.960 --> 18:59.995
Sean?

19:00.080 --> 19:02.116
When did you get back?

19:02.200 --> 19:05.272
Something told me that you needed me.
So I decided to show up

19:05.360 --> 19:07.237
even though you didn't even ask.

19:07.320 --> 19:09.231
Oh, Sean.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.070
Good to see you, JD.

19:16.120 --> 19:18.634
Hey, you switched to frontsies.
