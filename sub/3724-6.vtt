MAN: Welcome to "Everlasting."

00:03.139 --> 00:04.918
[Cheers]

00:04.936 --> 00:06.465
- You got Carl's job?
- Yeah.

00:06.697 --> 00:08.898
Stop it! Congratulations.

00:08.915 --> 00:11.043
- I'm very happy for you.
- Let's roll.

00:11.693 --> 00:13.268
Why'd you come back?

00:14.417 --> 00:15.513
I wanted to see you.

00:17.157 --> 00:18.179
I can't.

00:18.541 --> 00:19.446
Why?

00:19.910 --> 00:21.549
'Cause I know how things start with you.

00:21.799 --> 00:23.090
Mary's a freakin' robot.

00:23.090 --> 00:24.479
I'm surprised she can feel anything

00:24.504 --> 00:26.297
with all the mood stabilizers she's on.

00:26.512 --> 00:29.967
She's bipolar and she has
PTSD from the domestic abuse.

You have taken everything from me.

00:40.435 --> 00:41.355
Not anymore.

00:41.363 --> 00:43.245
"Everlasting"... that was my idea.

00:43.425 --> 00:46.622
- I am suing for fraud.
- What?!

00:48.438 --> 00:49.882
You're the only thing in my life

00:51.115 --> 00:52.281
that I've ever done right.

00:53.650 --> 00:56.300
[Chuckles] Don't get all sentimental.

00:56.728 --> 00:58.715
I'm agreeing to her original terms...

00:58.743 --> 01:01.721
40% ownership of
"Everlasting" in perpetuity.

01:02.609 --> 01:03.932

Baby, I thought that it was hot.

01:34.799 --> 01:36.750
Yeah, being thrown around like a mannequin?

01:36.758 --> 01:37.798
- Screw that.

01:37.918 --> 01:39.798

01:47.445 --> 01:48.620
It wasn't like that.

Can we just pull up the Mary stuff?

02:13.352 --> 02:13.990

02:29.180 --> 02:29.798
What?

02:30.092 --> 02:31.763
Well, look at her... she's ancient.

02:31.779 --> 02:34.858
Tired, sad, saggy sack...

02:34.890 --> 02:35.978
who wants that?

02:36.666 --> 02:38.704
She's a year younger than me, asshole.

02:38.900 --> 02:40.027
Oops. Sorry.

02:40.147 --> 02:42.086
- I think she's really hot.
- You know?

02:42.497 --> 02:44.218
Mary should stay in the game.

02:44.383 --> 02:46.171
At least it would be a surprise.

02:46.291 --> 02:49.117
Not another tired, ancient season

02:49.140 --> 02:52.228
where a bikini model wins again.

02:52.275 --> 02:54.850
You know, if Mary could win
this, that would be amazing.

02:54.869 --> 02:55.863
That could completely up-end

02:55.863 --> 02:58.012
the entire societal
point of view on ageism.

02:58.016 --> 02:59.202
Not gonna happen.

02:59.699 --> 03:00.588
You know why?

03:00.897 --> 03:03.542
Because no guy wants that

03:03.662 --> 03:06.218
when he can have that.

03:06.473 --> 03:08.868
Grandma's going home this week, guaranteed.

03:08.988 --> 03:09.798
Really?

03:10.120 --> 03:11.889
There's not one man in the universe

03:11.913 --> 03:14.151
who would pick a strong, intelligent,

03:14.170 --> 03:15.300
slightly older woman

03:15.301 --> 03:17.641
over a bimbo with a sexy accent?

03:18.565 --> 03:19.625
- Nope.
- No, you're wrong.

03:19.645 --> 03:21.351
He absolutely could pick her.

03:21.515 --> 03:22.799
He's not as shallow as you think.

03:22.799 --> 03:25.213
Never gonna happen.

03:25.902 --> 03:26.798
Okay.

03:27.237 --> 03:29.933
Why don't you put your money
where your mouth is, big boy?

03:30.688 --> 03:32.629
50 bucks says she lasts the week.

03:33.975 --> 03:34.798
You're on.

03:34.918 --> 03:36.917
And stay close to your money, chica,

03:37.003 --> 03:39.848
'cause sad, old mama's going down.

03:46.436 --> 03:47.857
[Sighs] Okay, you know what?

03:47.876 --> 03:50.029
As of this minute, you are
co-producing Mary's date.

03:50.071 --> 03:51.408
I know that eventually, yes,

03:51.423 --> 03:53.267
she is going to lose to
the deep-throat queen,

03:53.295 --> 03:54.951
but Mary is not going home this week.

03:54.966 --> 03:56.604
Not if I have anything to say about it.

03:57.571 --> 03:59.196
Oh! That's girl power.

04:02.276 --> 04:04.251
Uh, what the hell are you doing?

04:05.312 --> 04:06.197
Instagram?

04:06.446 --> 04:08.691
Quinn just told me you're
co-producing Mary's family date.

04:08.700 --> 04:09.561
What the hell is that about?

04:09.567 --> 04:11.304
Mary is my girl now. That was the deal.

04:11.336 --> 04:12.701
Listen, Quinn just wants me to make sure

04:12.714 --> 04:14.339
the date goes as smoothly as possible.

04:14.459 --> 04:16.160
It's no big thing.

04:16.207 --> 04:17.920
You know, everything
with you's a big thing.

04:17.945 --> 04:20.119
Seriously, I want Mary to
stay in this competition.

04:20.137 --> 04:21.875
I think she's really good for the show.

04:21.933 --> 04:22.659
Wait.

04:24.086 --> 04:25.381
Why do you think Quinn
wants me on the date?

04:25.395 --> 04:26.580
Are you having problems?

04:27.393 --> 04:28.767
What's that supposed to mean?

04:30.133 --> 04:32.227
Nothing, okay? Nothing. I promise.

04:32.246 --> 04:34.811
I swear I'm on your side on this one.

04:37.198 --> 04:37.933
Hi.

04:39.084 --> 04:39.863
MAN: Rolling.

04:40.281 --> 04:41.827
And action.

04:44.899 --> 04:48.078
The family date... a
unique opportunity for Mary

04:48.097 --> 04:50.284
to introduce her nearest
and dearest to Adam

04:50.312 --> 04:53.446
before he whisks her off on
a stunning helicopter ride

04:53.666 --> 04:57.078
over the Marin headlands on
their way to dinner at Saison.

04:58.412 --> 04:59.078
Hi!

04:59.132 --> 04:59.923
Oh, Lil.

04:59.942 --> 05:00.655
Mommy!

05:01.793 --> 05:03.447
- [Laughs]
- Mommy.

05:03.921 --> 05:04.802
Oh.

05:04.856 --> 05:06.197
You know what? Who let Shia talk

05:06.198 --> 05:08.457
me into this family playdate?

05:08.504 --> 05:09.187
Ugh.

05:09.891 --> 05:12.108
This is a grade-A boner-killer, people.

05:12.198 --> 05:13.197
Boner-killer!

05:13.198 --> 05:15.602
Louise, it's so good to see you.

05:15.833 --> 05:18.328
Look at this place. I bet
you didn't even miss us.

05:18.364 --> 05:22.288
I miss you every minute.
Especially you, my baby.

05:22.341 --> 05:24.686
Oh, I can't wait to show you around

05:24.708 --> 05:26.197
and introduce you to Adam.

05:26.288 --> 05:28.723
He is so cute. Does he
really know the queen?

05:29.718 --> 05:32.420
Oh, he is adorable. He's a real gentleman.

05:32.420 --> 05:33.285
He's the real deal.

05:33.764 --> 05:36.015
And you guys, wait till you
see what we have planned today.

05:36.037 --> 05:37.971
It is fantastic. [Laughs]

05:37.983 --> 05:39.407
- Mary, cheers.
- Thank you.

05:40.065 --> 05:41.699
Oh, is everything okay?

05:41.819 --> 05:43.787
Yeah, couldn't be happier. Look at me.

05:43.866 --> 05:45.125
[Laughs]

05:47.723 --> 05:49.293
Virgin, silly. The real ones are for you.

05:49.363 --> 05:50.196
Okay.

05:50.198 --> 05:51.961
Come on, I'll give you the grand tour.

05:52.081 --> 05:52.947
After you.

05:52.986 --> 05:54.633
Come on, guys. Watch your step.

05:55.698 --> 05:56.539
So how was the flight?

05:56.598 --> 05:58.186
- Oh, first class.
- Yeah?

05:58.306 --> 06:00.078
- Wow.
- We aim to please.

06:00.439 --> 06:02.078
Hey. Bad morning?

06:02.198 --> 06:03.844
Nope. All good. Hand me that brick.

06:14.076 --> 06:17.731
Personally, I am so glad that
Mary got this family date.

06:17.766 --> 06:20.197
She's had hardly any time with him at all.

06:20.198 --> 06:22.226
- <i>She works so hard as a single mom... </i>
- Oh, you guys,

06:22.253 --> 06:23.962
- I can't. I can't.
- <i>... she deserves it.</i>

06:24.082 --> 06:26.511
Family day. Pbht.

06:26.631 --> 06:28.675
Talk about polishing a turd.

06:28.868 --> 06:30.355
- MAN: Cut.
- Thanks, that's great.

06:30.561 --> 06:32.978
- [Sighs]
- Let's go grab some B-roll.

06:33.864 --> 06:35.807
Gosh, this is so annoying.

06:35.851 --> 06:36.888
Ladies.

06:37.193 --> 06:38.556
How you doing? Feeling good?

06:38.585 --> 06:40.078
Uh, honestly?

06:40.351 --> 06:41.457
Is there any other way?

06:41.611 --> 06:42.935
I'm bored out of my skull.

06:42.962 --> 06:44.570
SHAMIQUA: No phone, no Internet.

06:44.645 --> 06:46.179
We're the two smartest girls in this house.

06:46.198 --> 06:47.235
Not saying much.

06:47.247 --> 06:49.356
We're down to talking about how many nails

06:49.368 --> 06:50.483
are in the carpenter's tool belt.

06:50.487 --> 06:52.589
Oh, my brain is turning into mush.

06:52.616 --> 06:53.583
I am so bored,

06:53.610 --> 06:55.973
I've been counting my eyelashes for fun.

06:55.981 --> 06:58.078
I mean, I haven't read the news in weeks.

06:58.286 --> 07:00.197
That's a bummer. I'm sorry.

07:00.317 --> 07:02.197
Oh, a... and today, family date,

07:02.198 --> 07:03.598
little kiddies running around?

07:03.672 --> 07:05.371
Sounds like "Nightmare
on Everlasting Street."

07:05.453 --> 07:06.078
[Laughs]

07:06.111 --> 07:07.668
Well, you are so...

07:08.259 --> 07:09.078
right.

07:09.774 --> 07:12.078
This show could use a little something.

07:13.576 --> 07:14.804
Would you excuse me?

07:15.198 --> 07:16.801
MARY: I'm just so excited to get out there

07:16.816 --> 07:18.487
and be with my little girl,

07:18.878 --> 07:21.197
and introduce this guy to my family.

07:21.198 --> 07:22.197
[Laughs]

07:22.198 --> 07:25.424
You know, Louise, my
sister, she is such a fan,

07:25.490 --> 07:26.840
she feels like she already knows you.

07:26.852 --> 07:27.584
- Oh, really?
- Mm-hmm.

07:27.599 --> 07:30.016
- Oh, I hope just the good stuff.
- [Laughs]

07:30.243 --> 07:33.613
Oh, God, come on, Shia. I hate this date.

07:33.929 --> 07:35.197
[Laughs]

07:35.789 --> 07:39.429
Oh, you know, I feel like family
is the most important thing.

07:39.706 --> 07:41.863
Right? I mean, without
their love and support,

07:42.298 --> 07:43.862
what else is there?

07:44.688 --> 07:47.158
Yeah, family's... I mean,
that's... Yeah. That's,

07:47.198 --> 07:48.534
yeah, delightful.

07:49.307 --> 07:50.937
Um, I'm gonna go get ready,

07:50.952 --> 07:52.272
and I will see you out there.

07:52.291 --> 07:54.788
All right. See you later, alligator.

07:55.604 --> 07:56.734
I'm gonna lose the bet.

07:57.067 --> 07:59.195
I'm gonna lose the bet.

07:59.198 --> 08:01.005
Jay. I need a bunny.

08:01.239 --> 08:02.497
No, not a Playboy bunny,

08:02.526 --> 08:05.168
a rabbit with red eyes and floppy ears.

08:05.198 --> 08:06.835
Just make sure it's freakin' adorable.

08:07.505 --> 08:11.639
<i>Isn't he just delicious?</i>

08:11.678 --> 08:12.549
QUINN: Oh.

08:12.593 --> 08:14.197
Oh, this is good. This is good.

08:14.530 --> 08:15.679
I can use this.

08:15.694 --> 08:18.022
Shia, whatever you did to wake her up,

08:18.047 --> 08:19.922
-  it's working.
- The whole idea of

08:20.421 --> 08:22.583
Adam meeting my

08:22.651 --> 08:23.742
daughter,

08:24.897 --> 08:26.292
my sister...

08:26.552 --> 08:28.555
well, they need to know him, right?

08:28.746 --> 08:30.527
They need to know that he's a good man.

08:31.114 --> 08:32.049
That was...

08:32.655 --> 08:35.013
That was the problem with my ex-husband.

08:35.018 --> 08:39.128
[Chuckles] He pretended to be a good man.

08:39.162 --> 08:42.977
He pretended to be a
loving man, but he was a...

08:44.695 --> 08:47.566
He was just a narcissistic...

08:49.191 --> 08:50.149
nightmare.

08:51.470 --> 08:53.911
Anyway... not Adam.

08:53.935 --> 08:55.858
He's not like that. He's not.

08:56.973 --> 09:00.031
Adam and I have something
really special together.

09:00.520 --> 09:01.376
We do.

09:01.700 --> 09:05.378
And a helicopter to dinner?

09:05.398 --> 09:06.675
[Laughs]

09:07.463 --> 09:10.388
I mean, who knows what could happen, right?

09:11.494 --> 09:14.078
Maybe my little talk
with her worked after all.

09:15.651 --> 09:17.344
Oh, that's great, Mary. Great.

09:17.393 --> 09:19.755
- Yeah?
- Uh, that's... that's all we need for now.

09:19.784 --> 09:21.031
Why don't you go grab some family B-roll?

09:21.072 --> 09:21.893
JEREMY: You got it.

09:22.504 --> 09:24.688
You, girl, are killing it.

09:24.727 --> 09:25.585
- You think?
- [Door closes]

09:25.597 --> 09:27.701
Are you kidding me? By the end of the day,

09:27.702 --> 09:30.147
Adam is gonna be wrapped
around your little finger.

09:30.369 --> 09:31.990
You just keep doing what you're doing.

09:32.037 --> 09:33.078
'Cause you're a star.

09:33.465 --> 09:35.181
Thanks. [Laughs]

09:35.757 --> 09:36.364
Mm.

09:38.499 --> 09:39.141
You know,

09:40.265 --> 09:40.982
I got to tell you,

09:41.198 --> 09:45.175
my doctor told me never
to mix this with this,

09:45.731 --> 09:48.230
but I feel amazing.

09:48.311 --> 09:49.116
Mm.

09:50.087 --> 09:51.955
I can do anything. [Laughs]

09:53.511 --> 09:54.357
Great.

10:00.208 --> 10:02.265
- <i>Mommy! Mommy!</i>
- MARY: <i>Oh, Lil!</i>

10:03.311 --> 10:04.961
All right, can you
fast-forward through that

10:04.968 --> 10:07.193
and just maybe get me
into Mary or something?

10:08.649 --> 10:09.357
What do you want?

10:09.385 --> 10:10.440
Well, the network pitch is today.

10:10.484 --> 10:11.564
I want to make sure you're on it.

10:11.595 --> 10:12.929
[Sighs]

10:16.181 --> 10:16.955
I'm on it.

10:17.847 --> 10:18.571
Okay.

10:20.555 --> 10:22.458
Let's hear it... partner.

10:22.705 --> 10:24.887
[Sighs] I have a lot of great ideas, Chet,

10:24.908 --> 10:26.543
and they're all right in there.

10:27.660 --> 10:30.196
Well, let's hear it. Start pitching.

10:30.198 --> 10:31.492
I'm a part owner now.

10:31.902 --> 10:33.289
I want to pitch to the network myself.

10:33.355 --> 10:34.920
You don't want to run anything by me?

10:35.198 --> 10:36.923
- Not really.
- Fine.

10:38.086 --> 10:39.914
[Laughter]

10:40.691 --> 10:42.482
Left hand, blue.

10:42.510 --> 10:43.534
MARY: Oh, uh...

10:43.575 --> 10:45.462
Oh, oh, oh. [Laughs]

10:48.552 --> 10:49.811
Oh, my God.

10:49.827 --> 10:51.938
I haven't done that in so many years.

10:51.960 --> 10:53.564
- I know.
- Another mimosa?

10:53.569 --> 10:54.985
Oh, don't mind if I do.

10:55.031 --> 10:56.859
Oh, no, she's doing virgins.

10:56.885 --> 10:58.309
Oh. Can't say I blame her.

10:59.361 --> 11:01.364
I love watching them play.

11:01.982 --> 11:03.366
Personally, I love

11:03.619 --> 11:06.606
sitting back with a drink while
someone else watches them play.

11:07.072 --> 11:08.876
MAN: Okay, everybody, take 10.

11:10.598 --> 11:11.828
I hate children...

11:12.160 --> 11:14.345
their rosy cheeks and their desperate eyes.

11:14.367 --> 11:14.907
Mm.

11:15.228 --> 11:17.899
Romance I'm fine with, but, ugh, children.

11:17.914 --> 11:18.970
Listen, romance is later,

11:18.995 --> 11:20.304
you just get through the kid part,

11:20.344 --> 11:21.161
and then we will get you

11:21.170 --> 11:24.107
on one of your little romantic
candlelight dinner dates.

11:24.163 --> 11:26.426
See, in England, adults don't
have to deal with children.

11:26.501 --> 11:28.266
That's why we invented the nanny.

11:28.286 --> 11:29.469
I didn't have a full conversation

11:29.472 --> 11:31.160
with my Gran until I hit puberty.

11:31.241 --> 11:32.396
I'd come down for supper,

11:32.458 --> 11:33.870
she'd look down her nose at me,

11:34.753 --> 11:35.570
not a word.

11:35.792 --> 11:37.727
She just assumed I didn't have
anything interesting to say.

11:37.746 --> 11:38.476
And you know what?

11:38.596 --> 11:39.340
- Mm?
- She was right.

11:39.375 --> 11:41.077
Listen, you're preaching to the choir.

11:41.153 --> 11:43.256
I am with you. I don't like kids, either.

11:43.293 --> 11:46.237
I saw a kid the other day at
the park eating a cigarette butt.

11:46.321 --> 11:47.035
And they're crazy.

11:47.047 --> 11:48.653
You know what? They just poop all the time.

11:48.669 --> 11:49.197
They're nuts.

11:49.286 --> 11:52.025
- They're like buffalo grazing.
- Okay, this is what you're gonna do.

11:52.091 --> 11:54.078
You're just gonna get down on their level,

11:54.514 --> 11:56.553
right? And you're gonna look
the kid right in the eye...

11:56.620 --> 11:58.647
don't talk down to them,
they don't like that...

11:58.678 --> 12:00.115
and you just be you.

12:00.198 --> 12:02.411
- That's it.
- Mm.

12:04.781 --> 12:06.331
You're g... I'm not even worried about you.

12:06.380 --> 12:08.198
- Yeah. Thanks.
- You're gonna be fine.

12:09.633 --> 12:11.301
You still counting your eyelashes?

12:11.379 --> 12:12.197
[Chuckles]

12:12.403 --> 12:15.201
- That is a rabbit.
- Oh, yeah.

12:16.007 --> 12:16.981
What's up, Doc?

12:16.983 --> 12:18.186
- [Laughs]
- You want to hold him?

12:18.212 --> 12:19.951
- Yeah, sure.
- Here you go.

12:19.952 --> 12:21.343
Okay. Hi.

12:21.463 --> 12:23.480
This is, um... This is strange.

12:23.505 --> 12:24.444
- Hi.
- [Laughs]

12:24.512 --> 12:27.824
Hey, what would you say
if I proposed an idea

12:28.225 --> 12:29.782
that would keep you in the competition

12:29.801 --> 12:31.611
and increase your chances with Adam?

12:33.411 --> 12:36.197
I'd say keep talking.

12:37.579 --> 12:38.313
Well...

12:38.323 --> 12:39.955
All right, give me your hands.

12:39.976 --> 12:41.292
Mm-hmm.

12:41.899 --> 12:44.305
- You have to put lots of flour on them.
- Okay.

12:44.791 --> 12:45.738
Good.

12:47.758 --> 12:49.675
QUINN: Now we're getting somewhere.

12:49.706 --> 12:50.829
[Chuckles]

12:51.565 --> 12:53.074
Simple enough, yeah. [Laughs]

12:53.075 --> 12:54.710
You're not bad at that.

12:56.501 --> 12:57.600
Keep going here.

12:58.755 --> 13:00.191
You're doing most of the kneading.

13:00.198 --> 13:01.164
Okay.

13:01.433 --> 13:03.478
Lily, come here.

13:03.967 --> 13:06.081
This is fun. You gonna help us?

13:06.649 --> 13:07.417
Here.

13:10.092 --> 13:11.760
Ready? Here.

13:12.029 --> 13:12.928
Remember?

13:13.953 --> 13:15.161
And then we...

13:15.816 --> 13:19.529
So, Lily Belle, is it
good seeing your mother?

13:19.891 --> 13:20.894
You're weird.

13:20.957 --> 13:23.197
- Lily.
- [Laughs]

13:23.515 --> 13:26.902
Aw. [Laughs]

13:28.148 --> 13:29.970
Yes, that is it.

13:29.990 --> 13:32.550
Mary is bringing it. Steppin' up her game.

13:32.670 --> 13:34.171
You're welcome.

13:35.913 --> 13:37.197
[Laughs]

13:37.317 --> 13:38.933
You got my money, bitch?

13:39.053 --> 13:40.821
Oh, I think I'll just hold onto it

13:40.829 --> 13:42.587
for another minute or two.

13:49.198 --> 13:52.009
- All right?
- Well, we can do something about it, I hope.

13:52.762 --> 13:53.857
We need toppings.

13:53.858 --> 13:56.122
ANNA: Hey, do you want to meet my friend?

13:56.548 --> 13:58.612
It's so cute. Is it real?

13:58.651 --> 13:59.879
Mm-hmm.

14:00.075 --> 14:02.197
Mommy, I want a rabbit.

14:02.428 --> 14:05.823
I'm so sorry to interrupt,
you guys... your family date.

14:05.943 --> 14:07.593
But when I saw this little guy,

14:07.628 --> 14:09.628
I just knew that the
kids would love to pet it.

14:09.677 --> 14:11.197
Oh, that's so sweet of you.

14:11.932 --> 14:12.722
Sweet?

14:13.248 --> 14:14.398
This is my time.

14:15.171 --> 14:16.614
I... it's my date.

14:19.412 --> 14:20.816
You know, uh, honey,

14:21.198 --> 14:24.239
everybody here might be blind as a bat,

14:24.359 --> 14:26.377
<i>but I have eyes. Do you hear me?</i>

14:26.620 --> 14:27.490
[Sighs]

14:27.610 --> 14:29.078
And I can see you.

14:31.260 --> 14:33.466
Mommy. The rabbit.

14:33.917 --> 14:36.309
[Chuckles] Of course.

14:37.337 --> 14:38.510
It's yours now.

14:38.994 --> 14:39.994
Go play.

14:40.942 --> 14:42.204
Mary, I wasn't trying to...

14:42.209 --> 14:45.584
This is my date with Adam,
and we're getting along great,

14:45.614 --> 14:49.013
better than you ever did, so just get lost.

14:57.970 --> 14:59.192
It's time for you

14:59.603 --> 15:02.821
to wiggle your sweet little
lawyer ass out of here.

15:02.941 --> 15:04.431
Okay, you had your bunny moment.

15:04.817 --> 15:06.108
Get the hell out!

15:10.098 --> 15:11.680
Charades? [ <i>Laughs</i> ]

15:11.800 --> 15:13.135
-  <i>Face painting?</i>
- [Groans]

15:13.165 --> 15:16.432
Oh, that's what every guy
wants... a bunny boiler.

15:16.552 --> 15:19.833
Adam's never gonna keep her... never.

15:20.205 --> 15:22.474
Don't worry about the
money, Quinn. I trust you.

15:22.551 --> 15:23.991
I'll see you at the pitch.

15:27.126 --> 15:29.332
What the hell is going on with Mary?

15:29.452 --> 15:31.837
H... has she been like this the whole time?

15:32.098 --> 15:34.220
I... I know that was a little crazy, but,

15:34.278 --> 15:36.338
you know, she seems like she's
having a really good time.

15:36.402 --> 15:37.160
Right.

15:39.151 --> 15:40.858
When did she start drinking again?

15:40.978 --> 15:43.265
Oh, she's not drinking.
No, those are virgins.

15:43.725 --> 15:45.097
I wouldn't be so sure.

15:45.911 --> 15:48.020
I'm her sister. I know her.

15:48.768 --> 15:51.380
Okay, well, look, I can check with her,

15:51.449 --> 15:53.068
- but...
- Thank you.

15:54.355 --> 15:56.673
And can you make sure
that she's taking her meds?

15:56.845 --> 15:58.414
I... I'm worried that she's not.

15:58.434 --> 15:59.809
- It just seems like...
- Of course.

15:59.975 --> 16:02.322
But, you know, she really has been fine...

16:02.582 --> 16:03.863
happy, even.

16:05.747 --> 16:08.301
That's the thing with bipolar
people off their meds...

16:08.330 --> 16:10.228
they're really fun until...

16:10.806 --> 16:11.882
- they're not.
- Louise,

16:12.098 --> 16:13.599
stop worrying.

16:13.719 --> 16:16.837
Okay, go, relax, have fun. We got this.

16:17.850 --> 16:19.023
Okay.

16:23.444 --> 16:25.847
All right, we've got to
get Mary back up on top.

16:25.867 --> 16:27.745
We're gonna put this
vermin stuff behind us.

16:27.779 --> 16:29.281
Okay, what do you want to do?

16:29.325 --> 16:31.345
She's got an ex-husband, right?

16:31.359 --> 16:33.213
- He's a prick.
- Yeah, he hit her.

16:33.237 --> 16:35.482
He basically, you know,
broke Lily Belle's arm,

16:35.502 --> 16:36.978
so I would say "and then some."

16:37.507 --> 16:38.353
You know what we could do?

16:38.373 --> 16:39.424
We could just send out a second unit,

16:39.463 --> 16:42.169
get some B-roll of him apologizing or...

16:42.541 --> 16:43.876
I mean, I don't even know
what he would be doing,

16:43.891 --> 16:46.099
but it's got to help move the
needle a little bit, right?

16:49.099 --> 16:51.576
Or we could bring him in.

16:54.531 --> 16:56.096
- I don't know.
- No, no, no. Come on, come on, come on,

16:56.098 --> 16:58.738
come on. Look, every... every white knight

16:58.787 --> 17:01.281
needs their dark knight, right?

17:01.942 --> 17:03.698
- I don't know. That just feels...
- No, look,

17:03.818 --> 17:05.097
we bring in the ex-husband,

17:05.098 --> 17:08.848
and Adam has to take Mary's
side against him, right?

17:10.359 --> 17:11.983
He plays the hero,

17:12.625 --> 17:14.097
that brings them back together,

17:14.175 --> 17:15.746
which is great for her.

17:18.098 --> 17:19.150
I mean, it could help Mary

17:19.160 --> 17:21.136
get a little bit of closure, I guess.

17:23.098 --> 17:24.598
Yeah, because, you know,
I read about this...

17:24.657 --> 17:27.465
this thing where this therapy
where confronting your abuser

17:27.471 --> 17:28.821
actually changes your life.

17:28.851 --> 17:31.169
Right, right. And all
we want to do is help.

17:34.378 --> 17:35.257
Do it.

17:36.570 --> 17:37.254
All right.

17:37.374 --> 17:39.784
I've got to go to a network pitch,

17:40.098 --> 17:41.446
but if you need me, text me.

17:41.476 --> 17:43.119
Yeah, I'm on it. I'm on it.

17:43.144 --> 17:44.226
You're in charge.

17:46.231 --> 17:48.575
I didn't mean to disrupt anything.

17:48.614 --> 17:50.047
I just... I thought that the kids

17:50.047 --> 17:52.258
would like to see the rabbit. That's all.

17:52.478 --> 17:56.821
I mean, who knew that
Mary would react that way.

17:57.363 --> 17:58.973
It was... That was scary.

17:59.599 --> 18:02.025
Mm. It was a lot, actually.

18:02.867 --> 18:04.158
Is that good? Is that all you need?

18:04.192 --> 18:05.436
- MAN: That was perfect.
- Okay.

18:05.556 --> 18:07.484
All right, everybody,
pack it up. We're moving.

18:08.002 --> 18:10.135
"Who knew Mary would react that way?"

18:11.911 --> 18:12.644
[Groans]

18:12.698 --> 18:14.553
You knew exactly what she was gonna do.

18:17.864 --> 18:19.065
[Sighs]

18:19.185 --> 18:20.780
I'm so sorry. That was...

18:21.108 --> 18:22.835
That was stupid. It was...

18:22.955 --> 18:25.328
It was mean, even. I
don't know. It's like...

18:25.377 --> 18:28.936
I'm finding myself doing
dumber and dumber things

18:29.056 --> 18:30.195
just to try to get your attention,

18:30.226 --> 18:32.170
and it's ridiculous. It's not me.

18:32.207 --> 18:35.094
- It's not. I'm sorry.
- You got my attention right now.

18:37.310 --> 18:38.335
Oh.

18:38.561 --> 18:39.447
Um...

18:40.744 --> 18:44.058
Did we have something in Atlanta?

18:45.550 --> 18:46.901
'Cause I really felt like we did,

18:46.931 --> 18:49.457
and it's the only reason that I came back.

18:50.175 --> 18:51.224
But since then, I mean,

18:51.242 --> 18:53.988
we haven't even had one
moment alone together.

18:55.064 --> 18:56.923
And I'm doing it again.

18:56.941 --> 18:58.671
This place, it's, like, it's turning me

18:58.672 --> 19:01.044
into one of those women
who's just so insecure and...

19:01.093 --> 19:03.637
Look, I felt it, too.

19:07.349 --> 19:09.023
Um, when I get back from dinner,

19:09.054 --> 19:10.442
can you meet me here?

19:13.524 --> 19:14.692
I know a spot.

19:14.812 --> 19:17.248
I think I figured out how
to beat the security cams.

19:20.110 --> 19:22.115
Uh, it's a date.

19:22.928 --> 19:24.378
Perfect.

19:30.193 --> 19:32.594
- You did what?
- I just called the man.

19:32.604 --> 19:34.404
And invited him onto the show.

19:34.478 --> 19:36.566
- For an interview.
- This guy

19:36.610 --> 19:38.015
made Mary's life a living hell.

19:38.039 --> 19:39.149
He abused her for years.

19:39.184 --> 19:40.881
Which is exactly why we're
bringing him on the show.

19:40.915 --> 19:41.840
I mean, look at her.

19:41.889 --> 19:44.657
She's obviously stuck on
whatever that guy did to her.

19:46.032 --> 19:47.470
We're doing Mary a favor.

19:47.590 --> 19:48.987
Oh, that's a load of crap.

19:49.021 --> 19:51.154
You are doing what you always
do, which is make good TV.

19:51.169 --> 19:53.776
No, hey, I'm telling you the truth.

19:53.830 --> 19:55.229
Okay, it's going to be crazy empowering

19:55.234 --> 19:57.719
to watch Mary confront
this guy to his face.

19:57.839 --> 20:00.752
Speaking to your abuser, it is a huge step.

20:00.767 --> 20:03.024
It's gonna be amazing for the
million of other women out there

20:03.048 --> 20:05.519
who are letting their
husbands knock them around.

20:05.639 --> 20:07.216
So, this is a crusade?

20:07.510 --> 20:09.104
Mary just doesn't know it yet.

20:09.628 --> 20:11.887
Hey, Rachel, uh, he's here.

20:13.673 --> 20:14.881
[Scoffs]

20:19.538 --> 20:21.539
Kirk, hi. Rachel.

20:21.565 --> 20:23.338
- Hey.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

20:23.393 --> 20:24.769
I just want to make sure that you know

20:24.812 --> 20:26.322
that there will be cameras running

20:26.347 --> 20:27.766
- the whole time you're here.
- That's what the release said.

20:27.778 --> 20:28.570
Okay, cool.

20:28.758 --> 20:29.781
I just want to talk to her.

20:29.811 --> 20:30.840
That's all I've wanted for months.

20:30.864 --> 20:32.312
And this is your opportunity
to do that, you know,

20:32.312 --> 20:33.846
really tell Mary how you feel.

20:33.854 --> 20:35.712
Is it okay if I read off paper?

20:35.723 --> 20:37.707
- I wrote some things down.
- Yeah, Kirk, literally.

20:37.736 --> 20:39.285
Anything you want to do, but,
you know, I mean, personally,

20:39.286 --> 20:40.787
I think it would be better

20:40.788 --> 20:42.285
if you just spoke to her from the heart,

20:42.286 --> 20:43.286
you know, rather than reading it.

20:43.287 --> 20:45.285
Yeah. That's a good idea.

20:45.286 --> 20:47.285
Yeah, this is a really great
chance to get some closure,

20:47.286 --> 20:49.285
make things right between
the two of you again.

20:49.286 --> 20:51.019
Three of us.

20:51.355 --> 20:53.174
- Lily Belle.
- Oh, right.

20:53.199 --> 20:54.285
That's at her second birthday party.

20:54.286 --> 20:55.760
Oh, my God. What a face.

20:55.785 --> 20:57.286
Isn't she beautiful?

20:57.286 --> 21:00.286
Yeah, she can light up a room.

21:00.286 --> 21:03.285
You know, it's... it's been
hard being away from her.

21:03.286 --> 21:06.583
It's like, uh... It's
like a piece of me is gone.

21:07.872 --> 21:09.453
What's up with all the secrecy?

21:09.454 --> 21:12.285
[Laughs] This is so exciting.

21:12.286 --> 21:14.285
Is the helicopter gonna land on the lawn

21:14.286 --> 21:15.285
and take us to dinner?

21:15.286 --> 21:16.285
Is that what's happening?

21:16.286 --> 21:18.285
WOMAN: I can't tell you that.

21:18.286 --> 21:19.285
Oh, my gosh.

21:19.286 --> 21:21.285
Are we gonna ride horses on the beach?

21:21.286 --> 21:25.285
What's that phrase,
um... it's, uh... oh, right,

21:25.286 --> 21:27.285
"rode hard and put away wet."

21:27.286 --> 21:29.693
I'm sorry.

21:29.989 --> 21:31.988
I'm just really excited. [Laughs]

21:32.059 --> 21:33.693
KIRK: Mary.

21:36.635 --> 21:37.863
What are you doing here?

21:38.361 --> 21:39.499
I just want to talk.

21:39.883 --> 21:41.969
You can't be here. Oh, my God.

21:41.994 --> 21:43.501
I haven't... I haven't seen the show,

21:43.526 --> 21:44.782
- any... any of this.
- You have to leave.

21:44.807 --> 21:45.946
- I just, I've heard that you've been
- Please don't ruin this for me, Kirk.

21:45.971 --> 21:47.071
- talking about us, about the life

21:47.096 --> 21:49.517
that we had. I hear you've been dragging
my name through the mud

21:49.542 --> 21:51.454
- and telling stories about me on TV.
- You need to leave.

21:51.479 --> 21:53.143
You need to... Someone, please
make him leave.

21:53.168 --> 21:54.502
I just want to tell my side of the story.

21:54.535 --> 21:56.876
- Please!
- I don't care what you have to say.

21:56.901 --> 21:59.064
What are you doing here?!
How did you get here?

21:59.089 --> 22:01.603
They told me that you knew, that you
were okay that you knew I was coming.

22:01.635 --> 22:02.853
The producers said you knew.

22:02.878 --> 22:03.885
Okay, send out Adam.

22:03.910 --> 22:04.851
What?

22:07.760 --> 22:09.174
- Mary, you all right?
- Uh...

22:09.199 --> 22:10.198
This is him, huh?

22:10.770 --> 22:12.829
This is the English piece of crap, right?

22:12.893 --> 22:14.259
I didn't agree to talk to him.

22:14.284 --> 22:16.017
- All right, hold on, mate.
- Shut up, mate!

22:16.042 --> 22:17.634
I'm here to talk to my wife.

22:18.725 --> 22:20.289
Well, look, now's not the
time, so why don't we ju...

22:20.314 --> 22:21.650
- Back off.
- All right.

22:21.675 --> 22:23.306
Now is exactly the time, okay?

22:23.331 --> 22:25.197
I have been trying for
six months to talk to you.

22:25.222 --> 22:26.994
You're never home, you
never answer your phone.

22:27.019 --> 22:29.251
If I have to come on this
damn show to talk to you,

22:29.276 --> 22:30.610
then that's exactly what I'm gonna do!

22:30.635 --> 22:31.830
LILY BELLE: Daddy?

22:31.855 --> 22:33.134
MAN: No, no, no. Stay here.

22:33.159 --> 22:35.009
WOMAN: Wait, Lily Belle. Wait, wait, wait.

22:35.034 --> 22:36.189
KIRK: Where is she?

22:36.214 --> 22:37.041
Lily Belle?

22:37.066 --> 22:38.001
RACHEL: No, no, no. Lily Belle.

22:38.026 --> 22:39.025
Oh, Lily Belle.

22:39.050 --> 22:42.049
Oh, baby girl, hello.

22:42.316 --> 22:44.817
Oh, baby girl, I missed you.

22:45.483 --> 22:47.980
Hey, let's go get some lemonade.

22:48.481 --> 22:49.728
- Why don't you guys just talk to
- No, I wanna...

22:49.753 --> 22:50.892
each other, and I'll take care of Lily?

22:50.917 --> 22:52.298
They're just having adult time.

22:52.323 --> 22:54.587
Lily, I'll be right there.
I'll see you in just a minute.

22:55.683 --> 22:57.509
Mary, what the hell is
my kid doing on this show?

22:57.534 --> 22:58.908
It is a family date.

22:58.933 --> 23:00.869
How did she even get here
without my permission?

23:00.894 --> 23:02.888
Louise brought her to meet Adam.

23:05.645 --> 23:07.644
You want my daughter to meet this guy?

23:08.403 --> 23:12.861
Yeah, I do. Because he cares about me.

23:12.886 --> 23:14.556
That's the point of all this.

23:14.581 --> 23:16.728
You know, maybe we end up together.

23:16.753 --> 23:18.728
You're a delusional hag, you know that?

23:18.753 --> 23:21.306
This is no relationship
here. This is a reality show.

23:21.331 --> 23:24.001
- You sell soap to bored housewives.
- Shh, shh.

23:24.026 --> 23:25.361
He picked me.

23:25.386 --> 23:27.385
He picked me out of all those other girls.

23:27.410 --> 23:31.783
And you know what? I can
do whatever I want, okay?

23:31.808 --> 23:36.048
I'm the custodial parent.
The courts gave her to me.

23:36.073 --> 23:37.363
You stupid bitch.

23:37.388 --> 23:39.025
- All right, that's eno...
- Don't you touch me.

23:39.050 --> 23:41.049
You have lost it this time.
You hear me? Don't you ever...

23:41.074 --> 23:42.409
[Grunting]

23:45.722 --> 23:46.892
Go!

23:50.902 --> 23:53.189
Mary! Damn it, Mary, talk to me!

23:53.214 --> 23:54.213
Please, just talk to me.

23:55.003 --> 23:57.002
We need some help in here, ASAP.

23:57.027 --> 23:58.361
You... this is your fault.

23:58.386 --> 24:00.470
You know that this isn't
about "working it out."

24:00.495 --> 24:01.829
You lied to me. It was a trap!

24:01.854 --> 24:03.853
You know it was. You know you lied to me.

24:03.878 --> 24:05.197
- We need somebody to help please,
right now. - This is your fault.

24:05.222 --> 24:06.275
Admit it!

24:06.846 --> 24:08.846
[Gasps]

24:28.994 --> 24:30.994
[Horns honking]

24:33.173 --> 24:35.172
QUINN: Dud. Okay.

24:35.197 --> 24:37.993
Would you relax? You
don't have to memorize it.

24:38.018 --> 24:40.727
Just sell them. Tickle
their balls a little bit.

24:40.752 --> 24:43.751
Oh, don't tell me how to
tickle balls, all right?

24:43.784 --> 24:45.345
I know how to tickle balls.

24:45.370 --> 24:48.079
[Laughs] Brad.

24:48.104 --> 24:50.030
- Hey. How are you, man?
- Good, good.

24:50.055 --> 24:51.054
How are you?

24:51.079 --> 24:53.985
- Good to see you.
- Hi. Nice to see you.

24:54.221 --> 24:57.221
[Sighs] Is the camera okay?

24:57.222 --> 24:59.704
Uh, I think so, yeah.

24:59.729 --> 25:01.018
Look, I just want to
thank you for everything.

25:01.221 --> 25:04.555
I... I just... I... I appreciate it.

25:04.556 --> 25:06.930
Yeah.

25:06.931 --> 25:09.723
Isn't Jeremy the best?

25:11.248 --> 25:12.247
Is your wrist okay?

25:13.040 --> 25:14.555
Yeah, yeah, it's fine.

25:14.580 --> 25:15.692
Here.

25:15.717 --> 25:17.422
- I couldn't find a steak.
- Oh.

25:17.447 --> 25:19.047
- [Winces]
- Oh, sorry.

25:19.072 --> 25:20.852
- Got it?
- Yep.

25:21.907 --> 25:24.031
You know, that was really great
what you did, stepping up for Mary.

25:24.056 --> 25:26.222
What was I supposed to
do? He was gonna hurt her.

25:26.826 --> 25:28.657
[Sighs]

25:29.212 --> 25:31.844
What were you thinking,
sending him in like that?

25:33.160 --> 25:35.266
That was so brave of you, Adam.

25:35.291 --> 25:37.290
How am I gonna thank you?

25:37.315 --> 25:41.086
And you... how could you
do this to us, to Lily?

25:41.111 --> 25:44.321
- Look, Mary, I thought that I was help...
- You know, forget it. Just go away.

25:44.392 --> 25:46.392
Leave us alone.

25:52.599 --> 25:54.308
So, what do you got?

25:54.309 --> 25:57.598
How about Joaquin Ellis?

25:57.599 --> 26:00.598
The, uh, action-hero guy?
I thought he was in rehab.

26:01.032 --> 26:04.598
He was, but now he's lined
up to be our new suitor.

26:05.243 --> 26:06.242
No kidding.

26:06.243 --> 26:07.243
Isn't that great?

26:07.244 --> 26:10.524
Yeah, his recognition
numbers are astronomical...

26:10.549 --> 26:14.040
an 80%-plus in 16-24,

26:14.243 --> 26:17.579
and 60%-plus across all demographics.

26:17.604 --> 26:19.938
And even though his last few movies tanked,

26:19.963 --> 26:22.796
his Q score is still in the 30s.

26:25.860 --> 26:28.859
Plus, he O.D.'d on top
of one of the Jennifers.

26:28.860 --> 26:30.860
That's the talk around town, anyway.

26:30.861 --> 26:32.274
And you know what? He's part owner

26:32.299 --> 26:33.641
in one of those companies

26:33.666 --> 26:35.542
that sends regular Joes up into space.

26:35.567 --> 26:37.689
So, the girls going into space?

26:38.165 --> 26:40.194
Almost... uh, we put them in that jet

26:40.195 --> 26:41.859
that makes them weightless.

26:42.180 --> 26:44.540
Won't they barf? I
mean, we don't want barf.

26:44.565 --> 26:46.564
Bikinis in space, Brad,
just bouncing around

26:46.589 --> 26:49.304
like that DD supermodel
in that space video.

26:49.329 --> 26:50.328
There you go.

26:50.353 --> 26:52.165
Yeah, and we'll call it "The Gravity Date."

26:52.197 --> 26:54.524
- You know, like the movie.
- Only less depressing.

26:54.549 --> 26:57.516
Because the winner gets Clooney.

26:57.541 --> 26:59.485
Only better because in our version,

26:59.510 --> 27:00.805
Clooney's still single.

27:01.430 --> 27:03.008
I like it.

27:03.329 --> 27:05.328
You deliver Ellis, we're in, huh?

27:05.595 --> 27:07.471
Bang, zoom. Thanks, Brad.

27:07.496 --> 27:09.344
Oh, thank you. Thanks so much.

27:09.369 --> 27:11.477
- Thanks, guys.
- Thank you. Nice to see you.

27:11.502 --> 27:13.791
Tickle their balls a little bit, m'kay?

27:13.816 --> 27:15.079
[Laughs]

27:16.798 --> 27:18.946
[Indistinct conversations]

27:18.971 --> 27:19.971
[Crunches]

27:25.244 --> 27:27.938
So, let me guess, it was supposed to be

27:27.963 --> 27:28.961
"a stand up to the bastard moment."

27:28.986 --> 27:30.149
That's what you were going for?

27:30.665 --> 27:33.235
You came off looking great.
That's very important.

27:33.260 --> 27:35.258
Oh, well, you'd think I saved her family

27:35.283 --> 27:37.282
from being pillaged by Russian Cossacks.

27:37.307 --> 27:40.307
Kirk, Cossacks... it's the same difference.

27:40.332 --> 27:42.508
But, listen, it's very easy
for you from here on out.

27:42.533 --> 27:43.633
You know, all you have to do

27:43.658 --> 27:46.067
is a helicopter ride,
a romantic dinner date,

27:46.092 --> 27:47.923
and some, uh, making out on the beach,

27:47.948 --> 27:50.824
which I know that you'll ace, so...

27:51.565 --> 27:52.687
After all that rigmarole,

27:52.712 --> 27:54.126
I have to keep her now, don't I?

27:54.151 --> 27:55.493
Mm-hmm, unless you want the entire country

27:55.518 --> 27:58.235
- to think you're a dick.
- Thought so.

27:58.648 --> 28:00.907
She's just, uh...

28:00.932 --> 28:02.985
She's intense.

28:03.946 --> 28:05.945
Poor Adam, I'm sorry your job

28:05.970 --> 28:08.137
isn't all BJs and pool parties.

28:08.162 --> 28:09.994
Hey, the evening's young yet.

28:11.687 --> 28:13.391
You liking anyone?

28:14.671 --> 28:15.829
Besides Grace.

28:18.460 --> 28:20.094
Maybe.

28:27.946 --> 28:31.172
And what an eventful family date
it's been here at the mansion.

28:31.204 --> 28:34.493
Now, before Adam and Mary
take a moment to prepare

28:34.518 --> 28:36.517
for tonight's romantic tête-à-tête,

28:36.542 --> 28:39.541
we were given the opportunity
to catch up with them.

28:40.367 --> 28:41.367
Adam.

28:41.392 --> 28:46.211
Yes, um... honestly,
Mary, before today began,

28:46.236 --> 28:48.258
I had no idea what a
relationship between us

28:48.283 --> 28:49.563
would look like.

28:49.923 --> 28:51.922
I mean, you have a child, family.

28:51.947 --> 28:54.946
I have an empty office and
a cold bed-sit in London.

28:55.860 --> 28:58.859
But after spending the day with you today,

28:59.180 --> 29:01.179
and seeing first-hand

29:01.204 --> 29:02.899
what you've had to...
go through with Kirk...

29:04.134 --> 29:06.133
I have a new respect for you, Mary.

29:07.384 --> 29:09.844
And a new respect for what it
means to be a single mother.

29:10.820 --> 29:12.169
He's good.

29:12.194 --> 29:13.719
I don't do this very often,

29:13.744 --> 29:16.743
but I wonder if you wouldn't
accept this special key

29:16.768 --> 29:18.767
in advance of the next ceremony?

29:18.792 --> 29:20.625
So you can relax and know that you are safe

29:20.650 --> 29:22.016
through to the next round of competition.

29:22.041 --> 29:26.071
So, Mary, will you accept
this Everlasting key?

29:28.774 --> 29:31.650
Yes. Yes, Adam, of course.

29:31.675 --> 29:32.797
Nice.

29:33.452 --> 29:34.758
There you go.

29:34.977 --> 29:36.445
Oh.

29:37.985 --> 29:39.695
Thank you.

29:42.079 --> 29:44.079
Oh.

29:46.891 --> 29:49.891
I got to say, you can
take that to the bank.

29:54.213 --> 29:57.379
I know he feels something for me.

29:57.380 --> 30:01.563
I could sense it when I kissed him.

30:01.564 --> 30:05.970
Isn't Lily Belle just beautiful, hmm?

30:05.995 --> 30:08.837
I hope that she likes it in the U.K.

30:10.322 --> 30:11.877
The weather, right?

30:11.878 --> 30:14.587
Because I... I just keep envisioning

30:14.588 --> 30:17.212
th... that Little Match
Girl freezing in the doorway.

30:17.213 --> 30:18.252
You know?

30:19.878 --> 30:23.877
And Kirk... he's really had his
last laugh, that's for sure.

30:23.878 --> 30:28.877
He thinks that he can just walk
in here and tell me what to do.

30:28.878 --> 30:30.877
No one can tell me what to do, right?

30:30.878 --> 30:33.877
My life is my own. [Chuckles]

30:33.878 --> 30:37.320
Well, how did it feel when
Adam gave you that key?

30:37.345 --> 30:38.877
That... that was pretty special, huh?

30:38.878 --> 30:40.877
Oh, Adam.

30:40.878 --> 30:44.877
And he... he is gonna
take care of us in England.

30:44.878 --> 30:47.580
You know, I don't mean, you know, money.

30:47.605 --> 30:51.604
I mean, like, he'll protect Lily Belle,

30:51.878 --> 30:53.878
and then she'll have a
little English accent,

30:53.879 --> 30:56.878
and I'll be able to tease
her about it all the time.

30:57.525 --> 30:59.877
But how are you feeling about tonight?

30:59.878 --> 31:01.877
The date, with Adam?

31:01.878 --> 31:04.877
Tonight.

31:04.878 --> 31:08.877
Tonight is... special. [Laughs]

31:08.878 --> 31:11.384
I should change, actually,

31:13.228 --> 31:16.518
but I have to... do something first.

31:18.892 --> 31:20.275
I'm sorry.

31:21.878 --> 31:23.877
Just... one moment.

31:24.587 --> 31:27.877
MAN: Okay. Let's just, uh... Let's stand by.

31:27.878 --> 31:28.877
What's wrong with her?

31:28.878 --> 31:31.289
Uh, she's just nervous, I guess.

31:31.314 --> 31:32.587
That stuff with Kirk.

31:32.588 --> 31:33.877
You think?

31:33.878 --> 31:35.877
'Cause it seems a little
bit more than just nervous.

31:35.878 --> 31:41.439
Uh... well, you know, of course she's upset.

31:41.587 --> 31:43.877
You sabotaged her with her ex-husband.

31:43.878 --> 31:44.877
You set Adam up for a fistfight.

31:44.878 --> 31:47.587
For all I know, you sent Lily in there

31:47.588 --> 31:48.877
to push Kirk over the edge.

31:48.878 --> 31:50.878
If she is losing it, it's your fault.

31:57.971 --> 31:58.970
Is he in there?

31:59.136 --> 32:00.135
Only till the police get here.

32:00.160 --> 32:02.036
I don't think you should go in there.

32:02.061 --> 32:04.184
- He's restrained, right?
- Yeah.

32:04.610 --> 32:05.610
It's okay.

32:05.784 --> 32:07.705
You'll know if I need you.

32:07.871 --> 32:09.370
[Door opens]

32:11.922 --> 32:13.400
[Door closes]

32:15.383 --> 32:16.923
You're pathetic.

32:17.298 --> 32:19.798
Oh, here we go, just
in time for the speech.

32:20.220 --> 32:21.221
Can't wait to hear it.

32:28.455 --> 32:30.454
Burn in Hell.

32:30.571 --> 32:33.266
I don't need you anymore.

32:34.571 --> 32:38.438
I have a man, a real man.

32:39.906 --> 32:42.118
Did you see what Adam did for me?

32:42.508 --> 32:43.507
He loves me.

32:44.938 --> 32:46.626
More than you ever could.

32:48.679 --> 32:52.266
[Laughs]

32:52.313 --> 32:53.570
Oh.

32:53.571 --> 32:55.570
Look at you, up on your high horse.

32:56.461 --> 32:58.570
You play it well, Mary, I'll give you that.

32:58.571 --> 32:59.570
You're quite the actress.

32:59.571 --> 33:02.883
You got all these Hollywood
people fooled, don't you?

33:02.908 --> 33:03.907
But I know you.

33:04.571 --> 33:07.360
You were lucky to have me,

33:07.759 --> 33:09.758
because who else is gonna love you?

33:10.109 --> 33:11.313
Love me?

33:12.439 --> 33:13.969
You hit me.

33:13.994 --> 33:15.704
And what did you say when I hit you?

33:18.415 --> 33:19.414
I asked you to stop.

33:19.439 --> 33:22.680
No, you didn't. That's the actress talking.

33:23.173 --> 33:27.173
You said, "I'm sorry."

33:29.571 --> 33:30.727
No, I didn't.

33:32.430 --> 33:33.727
I love you.

33:34.571 --> 33:37.905
But, you... you brought this out in me.

33:37.906 --> 33:39.571
You make me do it.

33:40.266 --> 33:41.266
You want it.

33:43.448 --> 33:44.922
Be honest, Mary.

33:46.126 --> 33:47.829
Where does this come from?

33:48.430 --> 33:51.597
This darkness inside you, this wanting it?

33:51.739 --> 33:53.570
You're insane.

33:53.571 --> 33:55.570
No, you're the one who's crazy.

33:55.571 --> 33:58.899
And you're gonna give this
sickness to Lily Belle.

34:00.571 --> 34:03.008
She'd be better off with no mother at all.

34:03.391 --> 34:05.390
She'd be better off
growing up with strangers.

34:05.415 --> 34:06.582
No.

34:06.607 --> 34:10.438
At least then, she'd have a chance.

34:17.571 --> 34:22.016
MAN: And so, in preparation for
the romantic evening to come,

34:22.476 --> 34:25.476
our family date has come to an end.

34:27.625 --> 34:33.623
Oh. You are just such a lucky girl.

34:33.649 --> 34:35.648
Mm.

34:36.164 --> 34:39.665
That's me... lucky girl.

34:44.804 --> 34:46.149
Lily Belle...

34:49.571 --> 34:52.570
... just remember mama loves you

34:52.571 --> 34:56.626
more than anything else
in this entire world.

34:57.571 --> 34:59.906
I love you, too, mommy.

35:02.073 --> 35:03.633
[Vehicle door opens]

35:03.774 --> 35:06.180
Okay, Lil, come on. It's time to go.

35:08.174 --> 35:10.297
Oh.

35:11.899 --> 35:13.898
[Laughs]

35:14.383 --> 35:16.382
All right, come on.

35:16.407 --> 35:20.176
I... I'm so glad for today.

35:26.321 --> 35:27.321
Thank you.

35:31.364 --> 35:32.865
CHET: That was awesome.

35:32.890 --> 35:35.934
It was like the old days
... total Vulcan mind meld.

35:35.959 --> 35:36.950
"Boobs and Clooney"... sold!

35:36.975 --> 35:39.364
- QUINN: Because you're amazing.
- No, you're amazing.

35:39.389 --> 35:42.389
Oh, you and me together, that's the thing.

35:45.012 --> 35:48.343
Oh. Mmm

35:48.368 --> 35:50.536
- Let's do it here. Let's do it right here.
- Why, why, why, why?

35:50.568 --> 35:52.262
Come on, we got the whole mansion.

35:52.287 --> 35:54.059
- Come on.
- Okay.

35:54.084 --> 35:55.294
[Cellphone rings]

35:55.319 --> 35:56.318
Oh, hold on.

35:56.343 --> 35:59.053
[Sighs] What?

36:01.812 --> 36:03.568
Hey, Cynthia.

36:04.655 --> 36:05.654
Yeah.

36:06.077 --> 36:09.372
No kidding? You heard the heartbeat, huh?

36:12.959 --> 36:16.959
No. Uh... no, that's amazing.

36:19.202 --> 36:22.201
A boy? A boy.

36:23.163 --> 36:26.163
No, uh...

36:26.188 --> 36:28.853
Do you ever think we're moving too fast?

36:29.086 --> 36:30.404
What?

36:31.467 --> 36:33.763
Maybe we should postpone the wedding.

36:34.064 --> 36:36.561
[Chuckles] Is this about this morning?

36:36.624 --> 36:38.333
Oh, my God.

36:38.803 --> 36:40.865
Don't you realize what you did?

36:41.038 --> 36:42.914
How you jumped in to save her?

36:43.157 --> 36:45.279
[Scoffs] So this is about Rachel?

36:45.413 --> 36:47.581
No... maybe.

36:49.929 --> 36:51.928
It seems like you like hard-to-get,

36:51.953 --> 36:53.952
and I've made it pretty easy for you.

36:53.977 --> 36:55.977
What are you saying?

36:57.124 --> 36:58.123
[ <i>Grunting</i> ]

36:58.148 --> 37:00.724
If the rest of the footage backs that up,

37:00.749 --> 37:02.193
I think I might be in love with you.

37:02.225 --> 37:04.497
Well, it does, and Chet owes you 50 bucks.

37:04.522 --> 37:05.521
Congratulations.

37:05.546 --> 37:07.545
[Sighs]

37:07.570 --> 37:08.569
I thought you'd be happier.

37:08.594 --> 37:10.594
I am happy.

37:12.310 --> 37:15.574
- Hey, um, something's wrong. It's Mary.
- I don't even know.

37:15.608 --> 37:16.607
Where is she?

37:16.638 --> 37:17.799
Somehow she got on the roof.

37:18.074 --> 37:19.906
What? Uh, go, go. Go, go, go.

37:19.931 --> 37:21.929
I'll call the police. Go.

37:23.460 --> 37:26.337
[Breathing heavily]

37:34.866 --> 37:36.866
RACHEL: Hey, Mary.

37:37.392 --> 37:40.515
Don't. I'm serious, Rachel.

37:44.804 --> 37:47.803
Can we talk, just a bit?

37:47.975 --> 37:49.310
Talk?

37:50.304 --> 37:53.763
Okay, I know it was nothing
last time, but I am serious.

37:53.788 --> 37:55.664
We have a situation here.

37:55.689 --> 37:56.811
Oh, idiots.

37:56.836 --> 37:59.835
Do I have to blow the sergeant
just to get a car out here?

37:59.860 --> 38:01.859
Allow me to be the first to admit defeat.

38:01.884 --> 38:03.883
Mary's still in, loser pays.

38:03.908 --> 38:05.784
And I'd like to go on record saying

38:05.809 --> 38:07.266
that there are any number of hot,

38:07.291 --> 38:08.955
sexy 40-ish women in the world.

38:08.980 --> 38:10.979
Okay, do you think I care about a bet?

38:11.004 --> 38:14.171
I have a girl on the
roof and no camera, okay?

38:14.196 --> 38:16.027
I need eyes on the roof now.

38:16.052 --> 38:17.654
- No kidding, who?
- You know what?

38:17.679 --> 38:19.583
Can you just get out of my
way while I produce your show?

38:19.608 --> 38:21.154
- Who? Who is it?
- Come on.

38:21.179 --> 38:22.844
- Mary.
- Jeremy, where the hell are you?

38:25.429 --> 38:28.428
I don't want to feel this way anymore.

38:28.453 --> 38:32.620
And I... And I don't want to hurt my baby.

38:32.645 --> 38:34.476

You really don't have
to. We can get you help.

if I'm... if I'm good

or if I... if I'm a monster.

Just think of Lily Belle.
Think of your sister.

You don't understand, Rachel.

38:50.288 --> 38:51.162
Just, please, just...

38:51.187 --> 38:53.018
Mary, you are so not alone right now.

38:53.043 --> 38:54.042
I am with you, okay?

38:54.067 --> 38:56.066
It's gonna get better, I promise.

38:56.091 --> 38:57.090
All it takes is one day

38:57.115 --> 39:00.114
for you to feel differently
about everything.

39:00.139 --> 39:01.818
Just give me your hand right now.
