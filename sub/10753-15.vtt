WEBVTT

00:07.637 --> 00:12.108
You've seen the executive offices,
the advertising offices, lunchroom.

00:12.478 --> 00:16.869
We have now come
to the sanctum sanctorum: my studio.

00:17.236 --> 00:20.626
- You recognise that handsome rogue?
- Wow!

00:20.951 --> 00:22.987
Your head photographs
even bigger than it is.

00:23.246 --> 00:25.237
Very droll (!)

00:25.876 --> 00:28.834
We in the radio game
call this "the booth".

00:29.131 --> 00:34.080
It's here that I help the emotionally
distraught through their troubled lives.

00:34.473 --> 00:37.670
Mmm. Suppose this stuff's bulletproof?

00:37.979 --> 00:41.688
You could have gone home after lunch.
I thought you'd enjoy this.

00:42.027 --> 00:44.905
Don't touch!
It's sophisticated equipment.

00:45.199 --> 00:48.157
- What is it?
- I have no idea. Roz said not to touch it.

00:49.623 --> 00:52.012
- The usual procedure is...
- Testing, testing...

00:52.294 --> 00:56.606
Dad, let's go into Roz's booth.
You can touch anything in there.

00:58.096 --> 01:01.805
Hey, Frasier.
Hi, Mr Crane. What brings you here?

01:02.143 --> 01:04.179
He's gonna listen to the show.

01:04.438 --> 01:09.354
When Frasier was a kid, I'd take him
to the police station where I worked.

01:09.739 --> 01:13.527
Yes, he used to make a game
of locking us in a cell

01:13.871 --> 01:16.431
and pretending to lose the key.

01:16.709 --> 01:20.463
- I knew they weren't scared.
- We weren't.

01:20.799 --> 01:23.597
But after a while became quite hungry.

01:23.887 --> 01:27.596
- Frasier, can you lend me ten bucks?
- Did you forget your wallet?

01:27.936 --> 01:31.087
No, I gave my last money
to this poor guy in front of the building.

01:31.400 --> 01:34.597
He's an Australian tourist
who just needed ten dollars...

01:34.906 --> 01:38.455
- For a cab to the consulate?
- How did you know?

01:38.787 --> 01:41.904
There is no
Australian consulate in Seattle.

01:42.209 --> 01:44.325
Oh, that poor guy.

01:47.010 --> 01:49.126
Roz, he scammed you.

01:49.388 --> 01:51.856
No, this guy was for real.
He even said...

01:52.143 --> 01:55.180
"Give me your address.
I'll send the money back with interest."

01:55.482 --> 01:57.200
God...

01:57.443 --> 02:00.082
- I'm an idiot.
- No, don't feel bad.

02:00.364 --> 02:02.639
These guys are professionals.

02:02.911 --> 02:05.027
(Shouts)
Don't touch that!

02:06.166 --> 02:10.364
What is this place?
A radio station or a nuclear missile site?

02:10.715 --> 02:16.153
Don't feel bad. I was a cop for 30 years,
and they still fake me out occasionally.

02:16.558 --> 02:20.836
- These guys know what to do.
- Especially with easy marks like Roz.

02:21.191 --> 02:24.228
The criminal mind is complex.
They can fool you.

02:24.530 --> 02:28.079
Oh, lecture me
on the complexities of the human mind.

02:28.410 --> 02:31.322
I graduated in psychosocial behaviour.

02:31.624 --> 02:33.819
I know, I was at your graduation -

02:34.087 --> 02:37.762
a car backfired
and half of them wet their gowns.

02:38.094 --> 02:40.608
It sounded louder on the dais.

02:42.100 --> 02:44.978
Well, I wouldn't have been fooled.

02:45.272 --> 02:48.628
Oh, you think you can
spot a crook just like that?

02:48.945 --> 02:53.336
- If I can't, I'm in the wrong business.
- You want to bet on that?

02:53.703 --> 02:57.013
- Oh, what do you mean?
- It's poker night tonight.

02:57.333 --> 03:00.405
Two of the players are cops,
the third one's done time.

03:00.714 --> 03:03.023
Five bucks says
you can't tell the ex-con.

03:03.302 --> 03:05.452
- Can I get in on the action?
- Of course.

03:05.723 --> 03:07.998
Great. Ten bucks on your dad.

03:09.187 --> 03:11.382
You're itching to give your money away.

03:11.648 --> 03:14.003
You're on,
but you're underestimating me.

03:14.278 --> 03:19.272
What troubles are to pigs so are
these charlatans to my mental acuity!

03:20.580 --> 03:24.539
We didn't know better back then.
His mother smoked during pregnancy.

03:30.931 --> 03:33.684
Who are these people
coming over tonight?

03:33.977 --> 03:36.491
Dad's old friends from the precinct.

03:36.774 --> 03:39.572
Someone should have been cleaned up

03:39.862 --> 03:42.854
because someone
hasn't been smelling so fresh lately.

03:43.159 --> 03:46.071
Because someone
is long overdue for a tub.

03:46.373 --> 03:48.887
I've had a shower.

03:49.169 --> 03:52.241
Eddie is long overdue for a ba...

03:52.550 --> 03:54.666
- Don't say that word.
- What word?

03:54.929 --> 03:56.999
B-A-T-H.

04:00.813 --> 04:04.169
His yawns may smell like swamp gas,
but his spelling's improving.

04:05.279 --> 04:06.917
(Doorbell)

04:08.075 --> 04:10.066
I've made meatball sandwiches,

04:10.329 --> 04:14.288
pepperoni pizzas and sausage rolls.
Will you need anything else?

04:14.627 --> 04:17.903
The number of
the nearest gastroenterologist.

04:18.216 --> 04:21.015
Hey, come in.
These are my poker pals.

04:21.305 --> 04:23.945
Linda, Frank and Jimmy.
This is my son, Frasier.

04:24.227 --> 04:26.616
Linda, Frank, Jimmy, nice to meet you.

04:26.898 --> 04:29.253
Throw your coats on the couch.

04:33.367 --> 04:36.882
Hard to tell, isn't it?
They all look like they did time!

04:39.126 --> 04:42.084
My dad tells me,
he's filled you in on our little bet.

04:42.381 --> 04:46.260
I'm not allowed to ask
any questions about your line of work,

04:46.597 --> 04:49.669
but whatever questions I do ask
you must answer truthfully.

04:49.977 --> 04:53.572
- I just want to play cards.
- Great place you got, Marty.

04:53.901 --> 04:56.256
- Thanks.
- Actually, it's mine.

04:56.531 --> 04:58.806
Your radio show must do well.

04:59.076 --> 05:01.636
- Is this about 2,000 square feet?
- Yeah, about.

05:04.042 --> 05:07.114
Hm, that's interesting.
You noticed the space.

05:07.423 --> 05:12.372
Most people mention the view or high
ceilings, but you mentioned the space.

05:12.765 --> 05:17.202
It's almost as if you'd spent time
living in a cramped, confining area.

05:17.565 --> 05:20.159
You've been
to Jimmy's apartment, huh?

05:20.444 --> 05:22.639
- Hello, there.
- Hi, Daphne.

05:22.907 --> 05:27.264
This is Daphne Moon. These are
my friends. Linda, Frank, Jimmy.

05:27.623 --> 05:30.421
Daphne - pretty name.
Do people call you Daffy?

05:30.712 --> 05:32.703
Not twice.

05:35.052 --> 05:39.011
It's nice to meet all of you.
I've got beers for everyone.

05:39.350 --> 05:44.947
- Still drinking Ballantine's, I see.
- When you kick off, they'll go bust.

05:45.360 --> 05:47.920
Often, I come home
and see cans lined up,

05:48.198 --> 05:50.951
one after another like
little tin soldiers...

05:51.245 --> 05:53.634
Thanks. Don't you have a dog to wash?

05:53.917 --> 05:55.908
Well, I suppose I do.

05:56.170 --> 05:58.968
Of course
I have to catch the bugger first.

05:59.258 --> 06:02.807
- Maybe one of these would help.
- Beer's not good for dogs.

06:03.140 --> 06:05.779
No, but it's super for me.

06:07.146 --> 06:10.104
- She's pretty nice.
- Sexy, too, you dirty old man.

06:10.402 --> 06:14.111
- Oh...
- Interesting.

06:16.036 --> 06:18.869
You find her attractive, do you?

06:24.759 --> 06:26.989
Sure. Don't you?

06:27.264 --> 06:29.698
Yes, but attraction to one's own sex

06:29.976 --> 06:32.934
is a not uncommon result
of long periods of time

06:33.231 --> 06:35.665
spent exclusively in their company.

06:37.822 --> 06:40.211
- I may have underestimated you.
- Really?

06:40.493 --> 06:43.610
Yeah, you're making a bigger jackass
of yourself than I thought.

06:43.915 --> 06:46.270
High card deals.

06:46.545 --> 06:49.981
We could use some music.
Anybody play the harmonica?

06:54.182 --> 06:57.777
All right, my deal.
Dollar ante to start. Five-card draw.

06:58.106 --> 07:02.065
- Three-raise maximum.
- You sure you won't play?

07:02.404 --> 07:05.316
Oh, no, no.
I'll just observe the triumvirate.

07:05.618 --> 07:09.497
I will use my considerable education
and not to mention...

07:09.833 --> 07:14.429
Well, all right, let's say it -
my God-given gift to intuit.

07:16.010 --> 07:19.798
This is the kid who used to
get his head flushed in the toilet, right?

07:25.777 --> 07:31.249
- All right, I call. What you got?
- Full boat, aces up.

07:31.661 --> 07:35.097
Damn it, that's another one.
I'm losing my shirt here.

07:35.417 --> 07:37.647
Would somebody help me
with the coffee?

07:37.921 --> 07:39.718
- I will.
- OK.

07:40.926 --> 07:43.281
- I like your accent, you're from?
- Manchester.

07:43.555 --> 07:47.514
- Where the Beatles are from, right?
- Oh, no. That's Liverpool.

07:47.854 --> 07:49.924
- Who's from Manchester?
- No one.

07:50.191 --> 07:52.910
That's why I live here now.

07:53.196 --> 07:55.426
You've been awfully quiet.

07:55.701 --> 07:58.215
- Sorry, just observing.
- No, don't apologise.

07:58.497 --> 08:00.692
It was a compliment.

08:02.211 --> 08:04.520
Frank's an interesting study.

08:04.799 --> 08:07.233
Temper, loner, bit unsocial.

08:07.512 --> 08:12.108
Almost stereotypical of a man
who spent his entire life behind bars.

08:12.478 --> 08:15.436
This dish a Lalique or a Steuben?

08:17.278 --> 08:19.234
They had no spots in the laundry.

08:19.489 --> 08:22.049
He worked in
fine china and glasswares.

08:26.084 --> 08:29.963
Here you go, big winner.
Buy yourself something pretty and frilly.

08:31.886 --> 08:36.960
Sorry, Frank, I can't hear you.
I've got your money stuck in my ears.

08:37.352 --> 08:39.787
I guess there's only one thing left.

08:40.066 --> 08:42.421
How about it? Figured it out yet?

08:42.695 --> 08:44.651
I believe I have.

08:44.907 --> 08:49.537
Shall we step into the drawing room?
Please have a seat.

08:49.915 --> 08:53.510
OK, Sherlock,
you got centre stage.

08:54.965 --> 08:58.844
I have sketched an accurate
psychological profile of you all,

08:59.180 --> 09:03.014
and have come
to the incontrovertible conclusion

09:03.354 --> 09:06.824
that the criminal among us
can only be...

09:07.151 --> 09:10.302
-... Frank!
- Wrong. Frank's an undercover cop.

09:10.616 --> 09:12.607
Exactly!

09:15.124 --> 09:17.194
Just a little too obvious.

09:17.460 --> 09:20.418
The broken vocabulary, jailhouse pallor,

09:20.716 --> 09:23.594
- the underdeveloped social skills...
- Hey!

09:23.887 --> 09:27.482
You used psychology,
threw a gender-bender at me,

09:27.811 --> 09:30.769
thinking I would assume
a felon would be a man.

09:31.066 --> 09:33.216
Well, I'm on to you, mister.

09:33.487 --> 09:36.445
The criminal is the very wily Linda!

09:36.743 --> 09:38.574
- Nope.
- Jimmy!

09:40.331 --> 09:43.482
- You're right.
- Damn...

09:43.795 --> 09:46.628
- But you seem like such a nice guy.
- I am a nice guy.

09:46.925 --> 09:49.359
He was voted
most congenial in his cell block.

09:51.308 --> 09:54.539
- Sorry. You owe your dad five bucks.
- I'm afraid I do.

09:54.855 --> 09:58.564
Oh. You could probably use this.

10:00.364 --> 10:03.322
It's been a lot of laughs, but it's late.
We better get going.

10:03.620 --> 10:06.373
- Yeah, thanks, Marty.
- Yeah, it was great.

10:06.666 --> 10:09.100
You all come again anytime you like.

10:09.379 --> 10:11.688
Hopefully, when we're here, of course.

10:13.512 --> 10:15.264
- Good night.
- See you.

10:15.515 --> 10:17.187
Next week.

10:20.356 --> 10:24.429
Jimmy. Who'd have thought?
How do you even know that guy?

10:24.780 --> 10:27.658
He was a jailhouse snitch.
He helped us.

10:27.952 --> 10:31.865
I wouldn't trust him
if he wasn't surrounded by cops.

10:32.209 --> 10:34.165
- Who was a snitch?
- Jimmy.

10:34.421 --> 10:37.777
- Jimmy's an ex-con?
- You proved your point.

10:38.093 --> 10:40.607
I feel stupid as hell.

10:40.889 --> 10:43.767
- I feel a fool myself.
- Why would you care?

10:44.061 --> 10:47.576
I've agreed to go out
with Jimmy tomorrow night.

10:47.901 --> 10:51.780
- What?
- He asked if I'd like to go for drinks

10:52.117 --> 10:55.905
at the Topaz Room.
It sounded harmless.

10:56.248 --> 10:58.921
It's out of the question! Cancel!

10:59.211 --> 11:01.679
You said yourself
he was fun to spend time with.

11:01.966 --> 11:03.957
I said do time with.

11:04.219 --> 11:08.531
No, no. You can't go. Case closed.

11:08.894 --> 11:13.126
Forget that police mentality.
Don't you believe in second chances?

11:13.485 --> 11:15.715
I did, then we had Niles.

11:18.911 --> 11:21.471
When a man
has paid his debt to society,

11:21.749 --> 11:24.138
he deserves a fresh start.

11:24.420 --> 11:26.376
- She's not going.
- She is!

11:26.632 --> 11:28.748
- She isn't!
- She is!

11:29.011 --> 11:34.608
Excuse me. Might I interject one tiny
thought into this conversation?

11:35.020 --> 11:36.976
Belt up, both of you!

11:37.233 --> 11:40.430
It may have escaped your notice,
but I'm a grown woman.

11:40.738 --> 11:45.892
Nobody has told me whom to date
since school. And I didn't listen then.

11:46.289 --> 11:50.441
Now, when I've decided what I'll do
about Jimmy, I'll let you know.

11:50.797 --> 11:54.756
I'm going to my room! You two hens
have wasted enough of my time.

12:00.729 --> 12:02.685
That would have been
a very dramatic exit,

12:02.942 --> 12:06.093
if only her room was down that hall.

12:08.000 --> 12:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

12:15.171 --> 12:17.127
She shouldn't go out with that guy.

12:17.382 --> 12:19.577
- She won't.
- How do you know?

12:19.845 --> 12:22.837
She won't go against your wishes
if I'm any judge of character.

12:23.142 --> 12:25.940
Oh, dear God.

12:28.358 --> 12:30.314
What can I get you?

12:30.571 --> 12:34.928
- I'll have a decaf latte with skim milk.
- I'll have the same.

12:35.287 --> 12:37.642
Got it. Two gutless wonders!

12:41.004 --> 12:43.472
Thank you!
Certainly playing fast and loose

12:43.759 --> 12:46.876
with tips for a man who drives a van.

12:49.268 --> 12:54.547
Oh! How was your encounter
with Dad's poker buddies last night?

12:54.944 --> 12:59.574
The picture of you trying to converse
with Dad's cronies is priceless.

12:59.953 --> 13:04.743
When I told Maris, it was all she could
do to keep her eyes from dancing.

13:05.127 --> 13:09.598
It was rather interesting.
One of them did time in prison for fraud.

13:09.969 --> 13:12.642
- Good lord! What was he like?
- Quite personable.

13:12.932 --> 13:15.207
- Dad's so judgemental.
- He is,

13:15.478 --> 13:17.912
and I've often condemned him for it.

13:20.361 --> 13:23.910
Just because the man was in prison
he seems to be marked for life.

13:24.242 --> 13:26.631
Ridiculous.
Not all criminals are recidivists.

13:26.913 --> 13:33.022
Many have gone on to lead productive
lives. Dad's just being narrow-minded.

13:33.465 --> 13:35.421
I almost had to sedate him

13:35.678 --> 13:38.511
when Daphne
said she was going out with him.

13:39.726 --> 13:41.603
(Laughs)

13:44.985 --> 13:48.660
I hope you're just
yanking my giggle chain.

13:48.991 --> 13:50.788
What do you mean?

13:51.037 --> 13:55.076
You're letting this delicate English rose
be sullied by some sociopath?

13:55.419 --> 13:57.979
Oh... Niles, he passed bad cheques.

13:58.257 --> 14:00.817
- He's no sociopath.
- This degenerate should be put away.

14:01.094 --> 14:04.052
- You haven't even met him.
- They're all depraved animals!

14:04.350 --> 14:07.342
- Here's your coffee. Anything else?
- Yes, the cheque, quickly!

14:07.648 --> 14:10.037
- We've got to rescue her.
- Just sit down.

14:10.318 --> 14:13.196
- You're being irrational.
- Don't call me irrational!

14:13.490 --> 14:16.243
You know that makes me crazy!

14:17.914 --> 14:23.989
Now, Niles, Jimmy's a nice guy.
And Daphne can take care of herself.

14:24.425 --> 14:28.543
I don't care. I'm not without resources.
My tae kwon do instructor says,

14:28.890 --> 14:32.849
I'm just two moves away
from becoming quite threatening.

14:36.194 --> 14:40.073
Niles, just listen to me.
She'll resent any interference.

14:40.410 --> 14:42.719
Go and make a fool of yourself,
but I won't.

14:42.998 --> 14:47.230
- Fine. Tell me where they went.
- The, er, Topaz Room.

14:47.589 --> 14:51.025
I thought the cops
shut it down after the last shooting.

14:51.344 --> 14:53.494
I'll drive!

15:07.622 --> 15:09.977
Your shot, girlie.

15:15.301 --> 15:17.769
Why don't we make
this more interesting?

15:18.055 --> 15:21.684
All you have to do to win is
run those last five balls.

15:22.020 --> 15:26.093
- Let's double our bet.
- Oh, well, I might as well.

15:26.444 --> 15:29.720
I never really have
understood this game.

15:30.033 --> 15:32.786
I never understood
it when I first played it

15:33.080 --> 15:36.038
with my older brothers
at the age of six.

15:36.335 --> 15:39.930
And I never understood it
during my formative years,

15:40.258 --> 15:43.773
spent mostly
in the pool halls of Manchester.

15:44.098 --> 15:48.057
I played in local competitions
and club tournaments...

15:51.110 --> 15:53.260
...winning cup after cup,

15:53.530 --> 15:58.650
until our poor dad had to convert
the pantry into a trophy room.

16:00.959 --> 16:06.238
I can't claim to understand it -
eight ball in far corner -

16:06.635 --> 16:09.024
even today.

16:10.726 --> 16:13.798
But I certainly do enjoy it.

16:16.109 --> 16:19.306
Thank you, gentlemen.
And now, if you'll excuse me,

16:19.614 --> 16:23.243
I'm going to try to use the ladies' room
without touching anything.

16:35.223 --> 16:38.613
Look at this place!
I've never felt so conspicuous in my life.

16:38.938 --> 16:41.896
We'll simply try to blend in.
Fortunately...

16:44.405 --> 16:49.115
Fortunately, I haven't shaved for hours.
You should loosen your tie.

16:49.498 --> 16:54.128
- Try tucking in your watch fob.
- That's a Phi Beta Kappa key.

16:54.506 --> 16:59.944
Oh, then by all means let it dangle.
Perhaps they have a local chapter.

17:01.685 --> 17:05.121
Actually, this is quite stimulating
in a lower-depths way.

17:05.440 --> 17:08.000
I'm something of a squalor buff.

17:08.278 --> 17:11.429
The only problem is
I don't see Daphne or Jimmy.

17:11.742 --> 17:13.733
(Clears his throat)

17:14.914 --> 17:16.869
Excuse me.

17:23.053 --> 17:26.887
Has a young woman been here -
approximately 5ft 9¾,

17:27.226 --> 17:31.299
skin the colour of Devonshire cream
and eyes that gaze into one's soul

17:31.650 --> 17:34.210
with neither artifice nor evasion?

17:37.535 --> 17:40.333
This would be
an Englishwoman named Daphne.

17:40.623 --> 17:43.820
Oh, the one that came in with Jimmy.
She was shooting pool.

17:44.129 --> 17:46.484
- She's in the back.
- What happened to Jimmy?

17:46.759 --> 17:50.832
He tried to get fresh with her.
She threw a hammerlock, ran him out.

17:51.183 --> 17:54.300
- That babe can take care of herself.
- I told you so.

17:54.605 --> 17:56.800
Guy was no good.

17:57.068 --> 18:00.344
I knew it the first time I saw him.
You can always tell.

18:00.656 --> 18:02.851
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:04.079 --> 18:06.354
You've had your walk
on the wild side. Let's go.

18:06.625 --> 18:09.185
- What about Daphne?
- You heard what she did.

18:09.463 --> 18:13.058
- She'll be mad if she finds us here.
- Let's make ourselves scarce.

18:13.386 --> 18:15.581
Good lord, there she is.

18:15.848 --> 18:18.487
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- What the hell are you doing?

18:18.770 --> 18:21.159
- I'm sorry...
- You made me miss that shot.

18:21.440 --> 18:24.159
- I'm sorry.
- I had 200 bucks on that shot.

18:24.445 --> 18:26.675
REALLY sorry.

18:27.660 --> 18:29.810
- Where are you going?
- I'll be back.

18:30.080 --> 18:32.514
I'll just put another quarter in the meter.

18:32.793 --> 18:35.910
The meters don't run at night
and neither do you.

18:36.215 --> 18:39.252
An amusing play on words!
A regular George S Kaufman.

18:39.554 --> 18:42.068
We must tell our friends
about this place.

18:42.350 --> 18:46.866
- You owe me $200.
- I don't have that kind of cash on me.

18:47.233 --> 18:52.261
It would be absurd to bring it into a
place like this with the kind of element...

18:52.659 --> 18:56.777
- Maybe I could write you a cheque?
- My element don't take cheques.

18:57.125 --> 19:00.401
Maybe we should take
these guys outside and wise them up.

19:00.714 --> 19:02.625
Oh, that's not necessary...

19:02.884 --> 19:07.753
- Goodness! What are you doing here?
- We might ask you the same thing.

19:08.143 --> 19:10.338
This is one of our favourite haunts.

19:12.024 --> 19:14.982
Actually, Maris and l
had our rehearsal dinner here.

19:16.865 --> 19:20.221
It was different then.
It was more of a garden room...

19:20.538 --> 19:22.369
Shut up, Niles.

19:22.625 --> 19:26.379
- You followed me, didn't you?
- We were worried.

19:26.715 --> 19:31.152
Excuse me, it seems
your friends can't pay the 200 they owe,

19:31.515 --> 19:35.303
so I'll have to - pardon my French -
beat the crap out of them.

19:35.647 --> 19:39.435
I'm a psychiatrist. Maybe we could
take this out in sessions.

19:39.778 --> 19:42.815
- Outside!
- Wait!

19:43.118 --> 19:46.554
I have money. Would you like to go
for double or nothing?

19:46.873 --> 19:51.503
- On what?
- Well, you look like a betting man.

19:51.881 --> 19:55.954
I'll wager I can sink
these five balls with a single shot.

19:57.850 --> 20:01.684
If I do, these boys are square.
If I miss, you double your money.

20:02.023 --> 20:06.619
I'll take your money, but I was
looking forward to pulping this guy.

20:06.990 --> 20:09.060
Yeah, well, we won't quibble.

20:09.327 --> 20:14.242
If I miss, you can pulp him.
I'm feeling generous tonight.

20:14.627 --> 20:18.063
- I'll throw in the little one too.
- "Throw in the little one"?

20:18.383 --> 20:21.420
And what in God's name is pulping?

20:21.723 --> 20:23.759
You're on.

20:24.728 --> 20:29.597
OK, just to make sure this is
on the up-and-up, let's use six balls.

20:29.986 --> 20:35.106
Instead of sinking all five with one shot,
how about sinking all six?

20:35.496 --> 20:39.774
Do that and I'll forget the 200 bucks.

20:41.672 --> 20:44.140
Fair enough.

20:49.519 --> 20:51.794
Need a bit of chalk for me cue.

21:00.578 --> 21:02.887
Does it matter
in what order I make them?

21:03.166 --> 21:05.122
Daphne!

21:06.045 --> 21:09.162
Hey, lady, if you make
any of them, it'll be a miracle.

21:09.468 --> 21:11.220
Right.

21:11.471 --> 21:14.668
Well... Here goes nothing.

21:48.908 --> 21:51.297
Run for it!

21:55.711 --> 21:57.064
(Laughs)

22:04.558 --> 22:08.676
# Hey, baby, I hear the blues a-calling
Tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:09.692 --> 22:11.330
# Quite stylish

22:11.570 --> 22:17.361
# And maybe I seem a bit confused
Yeah, maybe...but I got you pegged!

22:18.791 --> 22:22.500
# But I don't know what to do with those
Tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:25.677 --> 22:28.032
# They're calling again

22:28.431 --> 22:33.107
# Scrambled eggs all over my face
What is a boy to do? #

22:35.150 --> 22:37.380
Good night, everybody!
