WEBVTT

00:00.720 --> 00:02.950
- MY ART CLASS IS GOING
TO ITALY FOR A MONTH.

00:03.070 --> 00:04.298
I'VE DECIDED
THAT I WANT TO GO...

00:04.410 --> 00:05.377
BY MYSELF.

00:07.520 --> 00:08.896
- I DON'T THINK
YOU SHOULD GET MARRIED,

00:09.000 --> 00:10.513
BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN
THAT I'M NOT GOING

00:10.630 --> 00:11.380
TO SUPPORT YOU IN THIS.

00:11.490 --> 00:12.388
- THAT REALLY HURT
MY FEELINGS...

00:12.490 --> 00:13.934
- I TRUST YOU,
AND I BELIEVE IN YOU.

00:14.040 --> 00:16.975
CAN WE PLEASE DO
THIS TOGETHER?

00:17.080 --> 00:19.969
- I KNOW I WAS
A REALLY GOOD SALESMAN.

00:20.080 --> 00:22.878
I'M JUST NOT SO SURE
I'M A GOOD FATHER.

00:22.980 --> 00:24.322
- YEAH.

00:24.430 --> 00:26.318
- YOU'VE BEEN DOING SUCH
A GOOD JOB WITH THESE TWO,

00:26.440 --> 00:29.364
AND I COULDN'T BE ABLE TO DO
WHAT I'M DOING WITHOUT YOU.

00:29.470 --> 00:31.882
THANK YOU.

00:31.990 --> 00:33.127
- I LIKE YOU.

00:33.240 --> 00:35.026
LIKE, MORE THAN JUST FRIENDS.

00:35.130 --> 00:36.233
- OH.

00:40.660 --> 00:43.584
[knocking]

00:47.010 --> 00:49.899
- HEY.

00:50.010 --> 00:51.113
- HEY, YOU.

00:51.220 --> 00:53.313
- WHAT'S UP?

00:53.430 --> 00:55.591
YOU NEED MY ASTRONOMY NOTES
OR SOMETHING?

00:55.710 --> 00:57.428
- NO.

00:57.540 --> 00:58.325
UM...

00:58.430 --> 01:00.182
I MIGHT BE A LITTLE DRUNK.

01:00.300 --> 01:01.870
- YEAH?
- LIKE A LITTLE.

01:01.990 --> 01:03.014
- I'M GETTING THAT, ACTUALLY.

01:03.130 --> 01:04.882
YEAH, THAT MAKES SENSE.

01:04.990 --> 01:08.289
DO YOU NEED SOMEWHERE
TO CRASH?

01:08.410 --> 01:08.922
- IS YOUR ROOMMATE HERE?

01:09.030 --> 01:12.921
- NO, HE IS NOT.

01:13.030 --> 01:15.169
- YOUR HAIR IS ALL MESSED UP.

01:15.280 --> 01:17.100
- YEAH, I WASN'T
EXPECTING YOU TO...

01:22.700 --> 01:24.930
ACTUALLY...

01:25.050 --> 01:27.359
YOU'VE BEEN DRINKING, YOU KNOW.

01:27.460 --> 01:29.803
YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

01:29.910 --> 01:31.081
I DON'T WANT--

01:44.510 --> 01:45.545
- HEY, HEY.

01:45.650 --> 01:47.686
TURN MY VOCAL UP.

01:47.790 --> 01:52.409
- OH, BOY.

01:52.520 --> 01:53.316
- FORGET IT.

01:53.420 --> 01:54.819
JUST PUT IT BACK
WHERE IT WAS.

01:54.940 --> 02:00.242
- OH, BOY.

02:00.360 --> 02:01.554
- STOP.
STOP.

02:01.670 --> 02:04.184
STOP.
STOP.

02:04.290 --> 02:05.188
NOT FEELING IT.

02:05.290 --> 02:07.326
NOT FEELING IT.

02:07.430 --> 02:09.364
- WHAT EXACTLY
AREN'T YOU FEELING?

02:09.470 --> 02:10.562
- WELL, IF I KNEW THAT,

02:10.680 --> 02:13.126
THEN I'D BE FEELING IT,
WOULDN'T I?

02:13.230 --> 02:14.504
- I CANNOT ARGUE THAT POINT.

02:14.610 --> 02:15.986
DO YOU WANT TO,
MAYBE, TAKE TEN,

02:16.100 --> 02:17.055
AND RECHARGE YOUR BATTERIES,

02:17.170 --> 02:19.309
AND WE'LL COME AND TRY IT AGAIN?

02:19.410 --> 02:21.162
- NO, I DON'T NEED
TO RECHARGE MY BATTERIES, BRO.

02:21.270 --> 02:23.204
THIS IS NOT OLIVER ROME'S FAULT
RIGHT NOW.

02:23.310 --> 02:25.653
IT SOUNDS DIFFERENT
THAN WHEN WE LEFI' IT LAST NIGHT.

02:25.760 --> 02:26.829
IT SOUNDS WAY DIFFERENT.

02:26.930 --> 02:28.318
- DO YOU WANT TO COME IN,
AND HEAR THE PLAYBACK?

02:28.420 --> 02:29.512
BECAUSE I BET YOU'LL
CHANGE YOUR TUNE.

02:29.630 --> 02:30.938
- IT'S NOT GOING
TO SOUND ANY DIFFERENT

02:31.040 --> 02:33.622
BECAUSE THIS SOUNDS LIKE YOU
SLEPT ON THE BOARD LAST NIGHT,

02:33.730 --> 02:35.004
AND EVERYTHING
SOUNDS DIFFERENT.

02:35.120 --> 02:36.382
- OH, I'M THE ONE
THAT'S HALF ASLEEP.

02:36.500 --> 02:37.694
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

02:37.810 --> 02:39.459
YOU THINK JUST
'CAUSE YOU'RE PUSHING BUTTONS--

02:39.570 --> 02:40.639
- I THINK ALL THE TONES
SOUNDS LIKE CRAP.

02:40.740 --> 02:41.081
- WHOSE FAULT COULD THIS BE,
OTHER THAN YOURS?

02:41.190 --> 02:43.294
- FUN, RIGHT?

02:43.400 --> 02:46.119
- I HOPE YOU WEREN'T PLANNING
ON SLEEP TONIGHT.

02:46.230 --> 02:47.458
- ARE YOU FREAKING SERIOUS
RIGHT NOW?

02:47.580 --> 02:50.469
- OH, ROME LOST THE PORKPIE.
THAT'S NOT A GOOD SIGN.

02:50.580 --> 02:51.956
- YOU KNOW THIS? YOU SEE THIS?
THIS IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW.

02:52.060 --> 02:53.300
- YOU KNOW I'M HAVING
A HARD TIME.

02:53.410 --> 02:55.549
- "CROSBY, I'M AFRAID
MY SONGS SUCK.

02:55.650 --> 02:57.470
AND MY FRAGILE EGO,
IT CAN'T HANDLE THAT."

02:57.590 --> 02:58.989
- "AND I'M UPSET BECAUSE I HAVE
A DEMONIC BABY AT HOME,

02:59.100 --> 03:00.920
AND I HAVEN'T SLEPT
FOR SEVEN DAYS."

03:01.040 --> 03:04.077
- "I NEED TO GET LAID, MAN.
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH MY LIFE?"

03:04.180 --> 03:05.966
- OH, MY GOD.
IT'S GETTING SERIOUS.

03:06.080 --> 03:07.240
I SHOULD GET IN THERE.

03:07.350 --> 03:08.829
- YEAH, ALL RIGHT.

03:08.940 --> 03:10.555
WELL, GOOD LUCK.

03:10.670 --> 03:13.355
- WHATEVER, THIS IS MY STUDIO
RIGHT NOW!

03:19.160 --> 03:20.252
- AH.

03:26.620 --> 03:28.713
[sighs]

03:40.110 --> 03:43.591
- HEY, IT'S YOUR PARTNER
IN CRIME.

03:43.700 --> 03:45.497
SO GUESS WHO JUST BESTED YOU

03:45.600 --> 03:47.215
FOR THE SHORTEST
REJECT ION EMAIL YET?

03:47.330 --> 03:51.289
"PER YOUR INQUIRY,
THE POSITION HAS BEEN FILLED."

03:51.400 --> 03:53.049
YEAH, YOU CAN FEEL
THE LOVE THERE, CAN'T YOU?

03:53.160 --> 03:56.459
ANYWAY, IT MADE ME THINK
OF YOU

03:56.580 --> 03:59.743
SO JUST THOUGHT I'D CALL.

03:59.860 --> 04:00.986
OKAY?

04:01.100 --> 04:02.408
OKAY.

04:02.510 --> 04:03.442
BYE.

04:11.490 --> 04:14.175
HEY, IT'S YOUR PARTNER
IN CRIME.

04:14.280 --> 04:16.077
SO GUESS WHO
JUST BESTED YOU

04:16.180 --> 04:18.660
FOR THE SHORTEST
REJECT ION EMAIL YET?

04:27.850 --> 04:28.771
- HEY.

04:28.880 --> 04:29.778
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

04:29.890 --> 04:31.152
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

04:31.270 --> 04:33.602
- YEAH, YEAH.
NO, EVERYTHING'S FINE.

04:33.720 --> 04:35.927
I JUST, I DON'T KNOW, I WAS
AT HOME, AND YOU WERE HERE,

04:36.030 --> 04:40.308
AND I WAS FEELING LIKE
WE WEREN'T CONNECTING.

04:40.410 --> 04:41.274
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

04:41.380 --> 04:43.029
- YEAH.

04:43.140 --> 04:46.268
I KNOW WORKING LATE IS
NOT IDEAL, BUT, YOU KNOW,

04:46.380 --> 04:50.248
UNTIL I GET OUT
FROM UNDER THIS PILE,

04:50.350 --> 04:52.762
I GOT TO KEEP UP WITH IT,
SO--

04:52.870 --> 04:54.076
IT'S SOMETHING
WE CAN TALK ABOUT,

04:54.190 --> 04:55.316
BUT THERE'S NO
OTHER WAY FOR ME

04:55.430 --> 04:58.217
TO GET OUT FROM
UNDER ALL OF THIS MESS.

04:58.330 --> 05:02.983
- I DIDN'T COME HERE
TO TALK.

05:06.300 --> 05:09.098
- NO, YOU DIDN'T.

05:09.200 --> 05:12.192
UH, WOW.
THIS IS A FIRST.

05:12.310 --> 05:13.823
- I MEAN, IF YOU
DON'T HAVE TIME...

05:13.930 --> 05:15.852
- NO, NO, I HAVE THE TIME.
- OKAY.

05:15.970 --> 05:19.098
- OKAY, LET ME JUST
BE SURE THAT'S--

05:31.150 --> 05:32.117
- OOH, OW.

05:32.220 --> 05:33.630
- I'M SORRY, I JUST--

05:33.740 --> 05:35.116
- NO, NO, IT'S FINE,
IT'S FINE, IT'S FINE.

05:35.230 --> 05:37.118
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.480
MAY GOD BLESS
AND KEEP YOU ALWAYS

05:54.590 --> 05:57.138
AND MAY YOUR WISHES
ALL COME TRUE

05:57.250 --> 05:59.457
MAY YOU ALWAYS DO
FOR OTHERS

05:59.560 --> 06:01.004
AND LET OTHERS DO FOR YOU

06:01.110 --> 06:04.568
MAY YOU BUILD A LADDER
TO THE STARS

06:04.670 --> 06:06.900
AND CLIMB ON EVERY RUNG

06:07.020 --> 06:08.214
AND MAY YOU STAY

06:08.330 --> 06:11.606
FOREVER YOUNG

06:11.710 --> 06:14.224
MAY YOU GROW UP
TO BE RIGHTEOUS

06:14.330 --> 06:16.503
MAY YOU GROW UP
TO BE TRUE

06:16.610 --> 06:18.225
MAY YOU ALWAYS KNOW
THE TRUTH

06:18.340 --> 06:21.229
AND SEE THE LIGHTS
SURROUNDING YOU

06:21.340 --> 06:23.228
MAY YOU ALWAYS BE
COURAGEOUS

06:23.340 --> 06:26.161
STAND UPRIGHT
AND BE STRONG

06:26.280 --> 06:28.100
AND MAY YOU STAY

06:28.210 --> 06:31.008
FOREVER YOUNG

06:31.110 --> 06:32.270
MAY YOU STAY

06:32.390 --> 06:34.449
FOREVER YOUNG

06:48.990 --> 06:49.888
- GOOD MORNING.

06:49.990 --> 06:52.367
- MM.

06:52.480 --> 06:56.064
- SO, UM,
THAT WAS FUN LAST NIGHT.

06:56.170 --> 06:58.024
- GOD, I'M SO HUNG OVER.

06:58.140 --> 06:59.209
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

06:59.310 --> 07:00.095
- ARE YOU WAITING
FOR ONE OF THESE?

07:00.210 --> 07:02.178
- NO, YOU CAN GO AHEAD.
- GREAT, THANK YOU.

07:07.280 --> 07:09.384
- [sighs]

07:09.490 --> 07:12.209
OKAY, WELL,
HAVE A GOOD DAY, I GUESS.

07:12.320 --> 07:16.529
- MM.

07:16.640 --> 07:19.154
- AND I PICKED UP
YOUR PRESCRIPTIONS, SO...

07:19.260 --> 07:20.249
- WELL, HOW COME
I NEED TWO BOXES?

07:20.370 --> 07:21.530
WHAT, AM I GETTING WORSE?

07:21.640 --> 07:23.016
- NO, I JUST PICKED UP
ANOTHER ONE

07:23.130 --> 07:24.574
SO YOU WOULDN'T HAVE
TO THINK ABOUT REFILLING THEM.

07:24.680 --> 07:25.817
- OH.
THANKS.

07:25.920 --> 07:26.227
- HERE, SIT DOWN FOR A MINUTE.

07:26.340 --> 07:29.309
- OKAY.

07:29.410 --> 07:31.640
- THIS IS AMEX.
- YEAH.

07:31.760 --> 07:32.715
- MORTGAGE.
- OKAY.

07:32.830 --> 07:34.400
- AND I MADE A CHEAT SHEET
FOR YOU.

07:34.520 --> 07:36.101
ALL THE NUMBERS
YOU COULD POSSIBLY NEED.

07:36.210 --> 07:39.486
THE HOTEL, OF COURSE,
WHERE I'LL BE STAYING.

07:39.590 --> 07:41.558
THE ART SCHOOL.

07:41.660 --> 07:43.104
THE BRUNSKY'S.
- WHO?

07:43.220 --> 07:44.312
- THE BRUNSKY'S.

07:44.420 --> 07:46.069
- BRUNSKY'S?
- OUR NEIGHBORS.

07:46.180 --> 07:47.078
NEXT DOOR.

07:47.190 --> 07:49.909
- OH, HUH.

07:50.020 --> 07:50.839
THIS IS VERY NICE.

07:50.950 --> 07:51.848
- ALL THE NUMBERS ARE HERE.

07:51.950 --> 07:53.497
EVERYTHING YOU COULD
POSSIBLY NEED,

07:53.610 --> 07:54.565
EXCEPT FOR THE ALARM CODE,

07:54.680 --> 07:56.329
WHICH YOU HAVE IN YOUR HEAD,
RIGHT?

07:56.440 --> 07:57.464
- GIVE ME A HINT.

07:57.580 --> 08:01.050
- OUR ANNIVERSARY.

08:01.170 --> 08:03.855
- OH.

08:03.960 --> 08:07.236
- SO, YOU'RE ALL SET,
YOU KNOW.

08:07.340 --> 08:08.546
- THANKS, HONEY.

08:08.660 --> 08:10.969
I'M ALL SET.

08:11.070 --> 08:13.413
- 'CAUSE YOU'RE GONNA BE HERE
ALL BY YOURSELF.

08:13.520 --> 08:14.179
- YEAH, I'LL BE FINE.

08:14.280 --> 08:15.201
OKAY?

08:20.560 --> 08:22.835
- ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT, "MAD MAX."

08:22.950 --> 08:23.700
THIS IS GOOD.

08:23.810 --> 08:24.731
LET'S TRY THE 100 MACRO

08:24.840 --> 08:26.080
WITH THE LENS HOOD NOW.

08:26.190 --> 08:27.225
- 100 MACRO WITH LENS HOOD.

08:42.720 --> 08:47.168
WHY IS THERE A PICTURE
OF AUNT SARAH IN HERE?

08:47.280 --> 08:49.555
- WHY ARE YOU IN THERE, MAX?

08:49.660 --> 08:51.412
COME ON, HUH.
YOU GOTTA STAY OUT OF MY STUFF.

08:51.530 --> 08:52.974
- YOU TOLD ME
TO GET A LENS HOOD.

08:53.080 --> 08:54.832
- YEAH, I DID.

08:54.940 --> 08:56.043
LENS HOOD.

08:56.150 --> 08:58.357
COME ON, LET'S GO.
WE'RE ALMOST DONE.

08:58.460 --> 08:59.427
- I SAW A MOVIE
ABOUT A SERIAL KILLER.

08:59.530 --> 09:01.327
HE KEPT HIDDEN PICTURES TOO.

09:01.430 --> 09:02.351
- THEY'RE NOT HIDDEN.

09:02.470 --> 09:04.017
- ONLY HE HID THEM
UNDER HIS BED.

09:04.120 --> 09:05.052
- OKAY, THEY WEREN'T HIDDEN,
MAX. THEY'RE IN A DRAWER.

09:05.160 --> 09:08.607
- SERIAL KILLERS
ARE 91% MALE, 54 WHITE.

09:08.720 --> 09:10.540
THEIR AVERAGE I.Q. IS 113,

09:10.650 --> 09:13.471
WHICH IS CONSIDERED
ABOVE AVERAGE INTELLIGENCE.

09:13.580 --> 09:15.400
YOU'RE WHITE
AND MALE AND SMART,

09:15.520 --> 09:16.646
SO YOU COULD BE
A SERIAL KILLER.

09:16.760 --> 09:18.580
- I'M NOT
A SERIAL KILLER, MAX.

09:18.690 --> 09:20.237
- OKAY.
- OKAY.

09:20.350 --> 09:22.375
YOU GOTTA STOP WITH
ALL THE STATS AND EVERYTHING.

09:22.490 --> 09:24.378
THAT'S FROM THE INTERNET.

09:24.490 --> 09:25.866
YOU'RE ON THE INTERNET
WAY TOO MUCH.

09:25.970 --> 09:28.552
THAT WIKIPEDIA, IT'S--
UNPLUG ONCE IN A WHILE.

09:28.670 --> 09:31.696
YOU SHOULD GO OUTSIDE.
YOU'RE PALE, TOO.

09:31.810 --> 09:33.493
GET SOME SUN.

09:33.600 --> 09:34.419
- DO YOU STILL LIKE HER?

09:34.530 --> 09:35.849
- NO.

09:35.950 --> 09:37.633
NO, I LIKE HER AS A FRIEND.

09:37.740 --> 09:38.911
- IF YOU DON'T LIKE HER,

09:39.020 --> 09:40.499
THEN WHY DON'T YOU
TH ROW THE PICTURE AWAY?

09:40.610 --> 09:41.463
- BECAUSE IT'S A GOOD PICTURE

09:41.580 --> 09:43.536
AND MAYBE I JUST WANT
TO KEEP IT.

09:43.650 --> 09:45.538
- BECAUSE YOU LIKE HER.
- NO, MAX!

09:45.650 --> 09:47.811
- WELL, NOW YOU'RE
RAISING YOUR VOICE

09:47.930 --> 09:49.477
WHICH MEANS YOU'RE ANGRY
OR FRUSTRATED.

09:49.580 --> 09:53.994
- I'M NOT ANGRY.
I'M FRUSTRATED, MAYBE, YEAH.

09:54.110 --> 09:57.489
LOOK, MAX,
YOUR AUNT SARAH AND I,

09:57.590 --> 09:59.478
YEAH,
WE DID LIKE EACH OTHER ONCE,

09:59.590 --> 10:02.900
AND THEN WE STOPPED,
AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS.

10:03.010 --> 10:05.387
IT'S ADULT STUFF,
AND IT'S MESSY, AND IT'S WEIRD.

10:05.500 --> 10:07.832
WE WERE DIFFERENT PEOPLE.

10:07.950 --> 10:10.089
I'M CRANKY.
SHE'S FLAKY.

10:10.190 --> 10:11.418
WE BOTH HAD BAGGAGE.

10:11.540 --> 10:13.292
IT DIDN'T WORK OUT,
THAT'S THE POINT.

10:13.400 --> 10:15.960
- BAGGAGE?
- YEAH, BAGGAGE.

10:16.060 --> 10:17.152
BAGGAGE.

10:17.270 --> 10:18.362
THAT'S THE STUFF YOU BRING
INTO A RELATIONSHIP,

10:18.470 --> 10:21.121
IF YOU WANT TO RUIN IT.

10:21.240 --> 10:23.231
- THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.
SUITCASES ARE FOR TRIPS.

10:23.340 --> 10:24.989
- THAT'S RIGHT, EXACTLY RIGHT.
IT'S A TRIP.

10:25.100 --> 10:29.059
IT'S A LONG TRIP
WITH A BIG SUITCASE

10:29.180 --> 10:30.488
FILLED WITH PAIN.

10:30.590 --> 10:31.864
- THAT SOUNDS
LIKE A METAPHOR.

10:31.970 --> 10:33.244
I DON'T LIKE METAPHORS.

10:33.350 --> 10:36.035
- ALL RIGHT, WELL, THEN STAY OUT
OF MY DRAWERS.

10:41.290 --> 10:42.632
- DOES AUNT SARAH
HAVE PICTURES OF YOU?

10:42.740 --> 10:45.664
- [groans]
YOU'RE KILLING ME.

10:45.780 --> 10:46.769
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS, EAT UP.
COME GET YOUR TREAT.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.393
- MAN, YOU'RE GOOD.
THANKS.

10:48.500 --> 10:50.502
- WE JUST THINK ABOUT LUNCH
AND, BOOM, IT APPEARS.

10:50.610 --> 10:52.601
- THAT'S RIGHT,
I'M A MAGICIAN OF FOOD.

10:52.720 --> 10:53.789
- NO PINE NUTS IN THIS?

10:53.890 --> 10:54.572
- I WOULD RATHER DIE
THAN LET THERE BE

10:54.680 --> 10:56.682
A PINE NUT IN YOUR SALAD.

10:56.790 --> 10:57.927
- I WOULD KILL YOU.

10:58.030 --> 10:58.576
- YOU KNOW, I ALSO HAND PICKED
THE STRAWBERRIES

10:58.690 --> 11:00.442
IN HUMBOLDT THIS MORNING.

11:00.550 --> 11:02.165
- YOU LIVE FOR THIS, DON'T YOU?

11:02.280 --> 11:04.999
- YES, YOUR DIGESTIVE HABITS
ARE MY LIFE.

11:05.110 --> 11:06.134
- RIGHT?

11:06.250 --> 11:07.797
- THINK ABOUT IT
WHEN I GO TO SLEEP AT NIGHT.

11:07.900 --> 11:09.344
- YOU KNOW,
EVERY BAND NEEDS AN AMBER,

11:09.460 --> 11:10.529
THAT'S WHAT I THINK.

11:10.630 --> 11:12.769
- YEAH, SIGN ME UP FULL TIME.
FULL TIME.

11:12.870 --> 11:13.939
- TWO OF 'EM.
- YEAH. ALL THE TIME.

11:14.050 --> 11:14.869
- YEAH.

11:14.980 --> 11:16.379
YEAH.
- LOOK AT THIS GUY.

11:16.500 --> 11:18.559
- YEAH, YOU NEED TO, OBVIOUSLY.
- YOU HAVE A FUNNY MACHINE?

11:18.670 --> 11:20.149
WE COULD USE A FUNNY MACHINE,
ACTUALLY.

11:20.260 --> 11:21.704
- THAT WOULD BE NICE.
- THAT'D BE REAL NICE.

11:21.810 --> 11:23.391
- HI, HONEY.

11:23.510 --> 11:24.602
- HEY, RAMBO.

11:24.710 --> 11:25.642
- OLIVER...
- COME IN PEACE.

11:25.750 --> 11:26.648
- YOU GOT A SECOND?
- FREEDOM.

11:26.750 --> 11:28.479
- YOU GUYS, CAN WE TALK?
- YEAH.

11:28.580 --> 11:29.672
- GIVE IT A BREAK.

11:29.790 --> 11:30.688
HI, SORRY.

11:30.790 --> 11:31.757
HE'S THE WORST.

11:31.860 --> 11:34.374
- SO, I JUST TALKED
TO FRANKLIN,

11:34.480 --> 11:35.856
AND HE'S GONNA DO IT.

11:35.970 --> 11:37.688
HE SAID HE'D COME UP
FROM L.A. ANY TIME WE WANT TO,

11:37.800 --> 11:40.030
AND HE'LL BE OUR WITNESS
AT CITY HALL.

11:40.140 --> 11:44.179
- OH, OH.

11:44.280 --> 11:45.554
GOD, THAT'S SO NICE.
I'M SO GLAD.

11:45.670 --> 11:47.695
- BUT?

11:47.810 --> 11:49.289
- MY MOM.

11:49.390 --> 11:51.187
AFTER TALKING TO MY MOM,
I JUST FEEL LIKE SHE'S GOING

11:51.290 --> 11:52.461
TO WANT TO BE A PART
OF IT NOW.

11:52.570 --> 11:54.458
IT WAS A REALLY GOOD
CONVERSATION, AND I FEEL LIKE--

11:54.570 --> 11:56.629
- OH, THAT'S GREAT, I'M GLAD
THAT YOUR MOM'S ON BOARD.

11:56.750 --> 11:57.842
THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT.

11:57.950 --> 11:59.463
- BUT--BUT SO,

11:59.580 --> 12:03.289
I WAS THINKING MAYBE
WE COULD HAVE A REAL CEREMONY

12:03.410 --> 12:05.549
NOW THAT THINGS ARE,
LIKE, ON BOARD, YOU KNOW?

12:05.650 --> 12:06.992
- YEAH.

12:07.100 --> 12:08.442
- IS THAT OKAY?
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW.

12:08.550 --> 12:10.962
WOULDN'T IT BE SWEET IF WE HAD
PICTURES, OR IF WE WANTED...

12:11.070 --> 12:13.345
- I MEAN, I FIGURED ALL
THAT STUFF OUT.

12:13.450 --> 12:14.417
- ARE YOU MAD?

12:14.520 --> 12:15.930
I'M SORRY I'M, LIKE,
SWITCHING A LOT, BUT--

12:16.040 --> 12:18.213
- NO, NO, HEY. HEY.
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO, OKAY?

12:18.320 --> 12:19.628
- [giggIeSJ

12:19.730 --> 12:23.496
- SO WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

12:23.600 --> 12:25.943
- OH, UM...

12:26.050 --> 12:27.699
- I MEAN, LET'S MAKE A PLAN.
- YEAH, I DON'T KNOW.

12:27.810 --> 12:28.970
WE SHOULD BOTH SIT DOWN
AND--

12:29.090 --> 12:31.706
- HEY, KITTEN,
I NEED A LITTLE SEA SALT ACTION.

12:31.820 --> 12:34.709
- I HAVE TO GO DEAL WITH THIS.
I'M SO SORRY.

12:34.820 --> 12:36.128
- YOUR STRAWBERRIES ARE OUT.
- OKAY.

12:36.230 --> 12:37.606
WE HAVE THINGS WE NEED
TO TALK ABOUT.

12:37.720 --> 12:39.506
- LET'S TALK ABOUT IT WHEN
I GET HOME, AND WE'LL GET GOING.

12:39.620 --> 12:40.814
both: OKAY.

12:40.930 --> 12:41.715
- I LOVE YOU TOO.
- LOVE YOU, LOVE YOU, BYE.

12:41.830 --> 12:44.890
GOD, LET ME DIG UP
SOME SEA SALT.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.377
[groans]
- YOU DON'T KISS ME LIKE THAT.

12:47.490 --> 12:47.922
- YEAH, WELL...

12:48.040 --> 12:50.315
[indistinct chatter]

12:50.420 --> 12:52.411
- MOM, THE MASHED POTATOES
ARE KILLER.

12:52.530 --> 12:53.417
THEY'RE SO GOOD.
- MAX.

12:53.530 --> 12:57.000
MAX, PUT THE CAMERA AWAY.
WE'RE EATING HERE.

12:57.120 --> 12:58.735
- JULIA, WHERE'S JOEL?

12:58.840 --> 13:00.728
- JOEL IS--
HE WANTED TO BE HERE

13:00.840 --> 13:02.569
BUT HE'S WORKING LATE AGAIN.

13:02.670 --> 13:03.807
- AGAIN?

13:03.920 --> 13:05.319
- HOW'S "PISTOL PETE"
TREATING HIM?

13:05.430 --> 13:09.196
- PETE IS WORKING HIM
LATE NIGHTS.

13:09.300 --> 13:13.054
- SHE'S A SLAVE DRIVER.
- SHE'S KEEPING HIM ON HIS TOES.

13:13.170 --> 13:15.331
IT'S GOOD.
- THAT'S AN AMAZING OPPORTUNITY.

13:15.440 --> 13:16.680
- IT'S AMAZING FOR HIM.

13:16.790 --> 13:19.998
FOR US, YOU KNOW.
- OH, YEAH, YEAH.

13:20.100 --> 13:21.374
- OH, MY GOD.
I'M CHEWING.

13:21.490 --> 13:23.208
- ALL RIGHT, MAX. NO MORE
PICTURES OF AUNT SARAH, MAX.

13:23.310 --> 13:25.005
- HANK HAS A HUGE PICTURE
OF AUNT SARAH

13:25.110 --> 13:26.031
THAT HE KEEPS IN HIS DRAWER.

13:26.150 --> 13:27.219
- OKAY.
- WHAT?

13:27.320 --> 13:28.719
- WHAT?
- WHAT--WHAT'D YOU SAY?

13:28.840 --> 13:30.558
- HOW DRESSED IS SHE
IN THIS...

13:30.670 --> 13:31.762
- IT'S BECAUSE HE LIKED YOU,

13:31.880 --> 13:33.188
BUT HE SAYS HE DOESN'T
LIKE YOU ANYMORE

13:33.290 --> 13:34.564
BECAUSE YOU'RE FLAKY,
AND YOU HAVE BAGGAGE.

13:34.670 --> 13:36.524
- BUDDY, THAT IS NOT APPROPRIATE
TALK AT THE DINNER TABLE.

13:36.640 --> 13:39.017
- MAX, THAT'S PERSONAL.
- HANK TOLD YOU I HAVE BAGGAGE?

13:39.120 --> 13:41.054
EXCUSE ME.
I HAVE BAGGAGE?

13:41.160 --> 13:42.570
WHO HAS BAGGAGE IN
THAT SCENARIO?

13:42.680 --> 13:44.398
- AND HE SAYS THAT
YOU SHOULDN'T MARRY SOMEONE

13:44.510 --> 13:46.330
WHO HAS BAGGAGE BECAUSE
THEY'RE FILLED WITH PAIN.

13:46.440 --> 13:47.543
- I'M SO SORRY.
- MAX, THAT'S ALL.

13:47.650 --> 13:48.810
WE'RE DONE.

13:48.930 --> 13:51.239
- FIRST OF ALL,
ARE WE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION?

13:51.340 --> 13:52.614
- THIS IS THE GREATEST
CONVERSATION

13:52.720 --> 13:53.994
WE'VE HAD IN MONTHS.

13:54.100 --> 13:54.998
I'M SORRY
THAT THE BABY'S MISSING IT.

13:55.110 --> 13:56.270
- WHY AM I TALKING?

13:56.380 --> 13:58.348
- ALSO, HANK AND I
ARE BEST FRIENDS TOO.

13:58.450 --> 13:59.439
- YOU'RE BEST FRIENDS?

13:59.560 --> 14:01.380
- YEAH, I SPEND MORE TIME
WITH HIM AFTER SCHOOL,

14:01.490 --> 14:03.412
THAN ANY ONE PERSON IN SCHOOL,
AND I'M HIS ONLY FRIEND,

14:03.530 --> 14:04.383
WHICH MAKES US BEST FRIENDS.

14:04.490 --> 14:05.730
- HONEY, I'M SURE HANK
HAS OTHER FRIENDS.

14:05.840 --> 14:07.216
- ACTUALLY, HE DOESN'T.

14:07.320 --> 14:09.595
- HE ALSO CALLS ME A WEIRD
NICKNAME CALLED "MAD MAX."

14:09.710 --> 14:11.462
HE EVEN CALLS ME "MAD MAX"
WHEN I'M NOT ANGRY,

14:11.570 --> 14:13.458
WHICH IS REALLY WEIRD.
- THAT'S NOT A WEIRD NICKNAME.

14:13.570 --> 14:14.707
THAT'S A COOL NICKNAME.
- THAT'S A GREAT NICKNAME, MAX.

14:14.810 --> 14:16.698
- WELL, SPEAKING OF BAGGAGE,

14:16.820 --> 14:18.299
I HAVE A LITTLE ANNOUNCEMENT
TO MAKE.

14:18.400 --> 14:20.709
- OH?
- YES.

14:20.820 --> 14:23.095
MY ART CLASS IS
TAKING A TRIP.

14:23.200 --> 14:25.612
- OH, COOL.
- WE'RE GOING TO ITALY.

14:25.720 --> 14:27.688
- WHAT?
- THAT'S GREAT.

14:27.790 --> 14:29.303
- WOW.
- THAT'S GREAT, CAMILLE.

14:29.420 --> 14:31.411
- WELL, IT'S LIKE A RETREAT.
A WORKSHOP.

14:31.520 --> 14:33.750
- HOW LONG?
- A MONTH.

14:33.870 --> 14:35.417
- DAD, THIS IS LIKE
YOUR DREAM VACATION.

14:35.520 --> 14:37.283
IN YOUR SPEEDO,
ON THE MEDITERRANEAN,

14:37.390 --> 14:40.143
EATING PASTA
WHILE MOM WORKS ALL DAY,

14:40.250 --> 14:41.239
SPILL SOME ON YOUR CHEST--

14:41.360 --> 14:43.328
- ACTUALLY, DAD'S NOT GOING.
- WHAT?

14:43.430 --> 14:46.661
- DAD'S NOT GOING.

14:46.780 --> 14:47.769
- YOU'RE NOT GOING?

14:47.880 --> 14:51.634
- DAD, WHAT'S THE DEAL?

14:51.750 --> 14:53.741
- IT'S JUST YOU?

14:53.850 --> 14:54.748
- JUST ME.

14:54.850 --> 14:59.810
- WHY AREN'T YOU GOING, POP?

14:59.930 --> 15:03.855
- WOULD YOU PASS
THE MASHED POTATOES, PLEASE?

15:03.970 --> 15:06.689
- YEP.

15:06.800 --> 15:10.008
- THANK YOU.

15:10.110 --> 15:10.622
- THIS BROCCOLI DISH
IS REALLY GOOD.

15:10.730 --> 15:11.651
- YES.

15:22.680 --> 15:23.874
- HI.

15:23.990 --> 15:27.118
- UH-OH.
WHAT'S THIS ONE GONNA COST ME?

15:27.230 --> 15:28.083
- WHAT?
- WHAT DO YOU NEED NOW?

15:28.200 --> 15:29.918
- I'M NOT HERE
TO BORROW ANYTHING.

15:30.030 --> 15:32.851
- I SHOULD START CHARGING YOU
FOR THIS.

15:32.960 --> 15:35.576
- NO, I JUST CAME TO VISIT.

15:35.690 --> 15:36.896
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.924
- ALL RIGHT,
WELL, HOW ARE YOU?

15:40.040 --> 15:41.689
- I'M GOOD.

15:41.800 --> 15:42.937
HOW ARE YOU?

15:43.040 --> 15:44.894
- [laughs]

15:45.010 --> 15:45.965
AS USUAL, YOU KNOW.

15:46.080 --> 15:46.694
- YEAH.

15:46.800 --> 15:48.859
UM.

15:48.980 --> 15:52.700
LISTEN, I--

15:52.810 --> 15:56.018
1--

15:56.120 --> 15:57.872
WHAT AM I TRYING TO SAY?

15:57.990 --> 16:01.812
ITS SAD SOMETIMES
THAT IT'S OVER BETWEEN US.

16:01.920 --> 16:04.024
- YEAH.

16:04.130 --> 16:07.850
- BUT IT'S OVER.

16:07.960 --> 16:08.858
- I KNOW THAT.

16:08.960 --> 16:11.611
- I KNOW, I KNOW.

16:11.720 --> 16:13.233
- WE DISCUSSED THAT.
- RIGHT.

16:13.350 --> 16:14.612
- WE DISCUSSED THAT A WHILE AGO.

16:14.730 --> 16:16.869
- IT'S JUST THAT, YOU KNOW,

16:16.970 --> 16:19.416
MAX BEING HERE HAS BEEN
SO GREAT FOR HIM,

16:19.530 --> 16:23.762
AND HE FEELS
LIKE YOU'RE HIS BEST FRIEND.

16:23.870 --> 16:26.907
BUT THEN HE SAID A BUNCH
OF STUFF

16:27.020 --> 16:29.705
AT THE DINNER TABLE ABOUT US

16:29.810 --> 16:32.631
THAT WAS SO SURPRISINGLY
INTIMATE,

16:32.750 --> 16:35.014
FOR YOU TO HAVE TALKED TO HIM,

16:35.130 --> 16:40.614
AND SO I JUST WANTED TO MAKE
SURE THAT YOU,

16:40.720 --> 16:43.029
YOU KNOW, THAT YOU CAN'T BE
TALKING TO HIM ABOUT ME.

16:43.140 --> 16:44.949
- FIRST OF ALL,
HE WAS TALKING TO ME, OKAY?

16:45.070 --> 16:48.346
I'M SORRY THAT YOU CAME UP.

16:48.450 --> 16:49.064
- IT WASN'T THAT I CAME UP.

16:49.180 --> 16:52.035
IT WAS THE CONTENT OF--

16:52.140 --> 16:53.550
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU WANT ME TO SAY.

16:53.660 --> 16:55.070
IT'S LIKE 20 QUESTIONS
WITH THIS KID, THAT'S ALL.

16:55.180 --> 16:56.283
- BUT, YOU'RE THE ADULT.

16:56.390 --> 16:56.936
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO GIVE HIM 20 ANSWERS.

16:57.050 --> 16:59.211
THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING.

16:59.320 --> 17:01.117
- IT'S NOT LIKE I'M SITTING
WRITING YOU LOVE SONGS,

17:01.220 --> 17:02.289
AND SINGING IT TO HIM, OKAY?

17:02.400 --> 17:04.288
- I KNOW.

17:04.400 --> 17:06.982
I'M NOT SAYING THAT YOU ARE
DOING ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

17:07.090 --> 17:08.466
- YOU KNOW, HE CAME TO ME, MAX,

17:08.570 --> 17:10.151
AND I THOUGHT I WAS DOING
SOMETHING GOOD FOR THIS KID...

17:10.270 --> 17:13.956
- YOU ARE DOING SOMETHING GOOD.

17:14.060 --> 17:15.300
- I DON'T LIKE THIS, YOU KNOW.

17:15.410 --> 17:18.299
THIS IS--HE--LOOK--HE--
I GOT A BUSINESS TO RUN,

17:18.410 --> 17:20.139
AND MAYBE HE JUST
SHOULDN'T BE HERE,

17:20.240 --> 17:21.889
BECAUSE HE IS A LITTLE GRATING.

17:22.000 --> 17:22.853
- NO, DON'T, THAT'S NOT
WHAT I'M SAYING.

17:22.970 --> 17:25.063
I'M NOT SAYING
HE SHOULDN'T BE HERE.

17:25.180 --> 17:26.442
- WELL, I AM.
I AM SAYING THAT, OKAY?

17:26.560 --> 17:27.788
I GOT TO DO THINGS
AROUND HERE,

17:27.900 --> 17:28.867
AND I SHOULDN'T HAVE A KID
WALKING AROUND HERE, OKAY?

17:28.970 --> 17:30.972
THIS IS A BUSINESS.
IT'S A BUSINESS.

17:31.080 --> 17:33.241
- DON'T DO THIS.
- I GOT A JOB TO DO RIGHT NOW.

17:33.360 --> 17:36.909
I GOTTA DO A SHOOT RIGHT NOW.

17:37.020 --> 17:38.157
- OKAY.

17:49.480 --> 17:50.879
- [sighs]

17:51.000 --> 17:52.194
- ONE OF THOSE NIGHTS WHEN
YOU WOULD DANCE IN THE LIGHTS

17:52.310 --> 17:56.269
WHAT ABOUT THIS
ON THE WAY BACK DOWN

17:56.380 --> 17:59.269
- I MEAN, IT JUST--
IT SOUNDS--

17:59.380 --> 18:03.032
- THAT SOUNDS LIKE OLIVER ROME
IS BORING OLIVER ROME.

18:03.150 --> 18:05.527
- YEAH, WHICH I DID
NOT THINK WAS POSSIBLE.

18:05.630 --> 18:07.939
THIS IS EXACTLY WHY LABELS
GAVE ARTISTS DRUGS IN THE '705.

18:08.050 --> 18:10.905
- I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT TO DO FOR HIM.

18:11.020 --> 18:12.772
- HAVE YOU GUYS
EVER SEEN THEM LIVE?

18:12.880 --> 18:14.256
- UH, NO.
- MM-MM.

18:14.360 --> 18:17.500
- OKAY, I SAW THEM A COUPLE
OF TIMES AT THE RED DEVIL,

18:17.610 --> 18:18.429
AND IT WAS
ACTUALLY VERY GOOD.

18:18.540 --> 18:20.462
OLIVER HAD, LIKE,
A LOT OF ENERGY,

18:20.580 --> 18:22.127
AND HE WAS REALLY CHARISMATIC
AND STUFF.

18:22.230 --> 18:23.640
- REALLY?

18:23.750 --> 18:25.399
- WELL, APPARENTLY
HE DOESN'T FIND THE LUNCHEONETTE

18:25.510 --> 18:26.477
AS CONDUCIVE TO CREATIVITY
AS THE RED DEVIL.

18:26.580 --> 18:29.026
- NO.
- I DON'T KNOW HOW TO FIX THAT.

18:29.140 --> 18:31.586
- WELL I WAS
THINKING, ACTUALLY,

18:31.690 --> 18:32.486
I MEAN, YOU KNOW
HOW HE NEEDS, LIKE,

18:32.590 --> 18:34.626
HIS EGO STROKED
ALL THE TIME.

18:34.730 --> 18:35.515
- STROKED, YEAH.

18:35.630 --> 18:36.449
HE NEEDS,
LIKE A FOUR HAND MASSAGE

18:36.560 --> 18:37.868
WITH EXOTIC OILS
AND ENYA PLAYING.

18:37.970 --> 18:41.485
- RIGHT, SO WHY DON'T WE JUST
GIVE HIM THAT, AND YOU KNOW,

18:41.600 --> 18:44.046
GIVE HIM LIKE AN AUDIENCE
TO PERFORM TO HERE.

18:44.150 --> 18:44.878
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
RIGHT HERE IN THE STUDIO?

18:44.980 --> 18:46.117
- YEAH, PRETTY MUCH.

18:46.220 --> 18:48.324
- WELL, HOW MANY PEOPLE
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?

18:48.430 --> 18:49.601
- I DON'T KNOW, AS MANY
AS WE COULD SQUEEZE IN.

18:49.710 --> 18:51.462
WE'LL MAKE THEM YOUNG AND HOT,
AND YOUNG AND HOT...

18:51.570 --> 18:52.150
- WELL, HOT'S NEVER A BAD THING.

18:52.260 --> 18:54.148
- I DON'T KNOW, AMBER.

18:54.270 --> 18:55.919
IT'S TOUGH ENOUGH
TO GET THESE FIVE GUYS TO FOCUS

18:56.030 --> 18:57.224
WHEN IT'S JUST THEM.

18:57.340 --> 18:58.546
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT
THROWING THEM A PARTY.

18:58.650 --> 18:59.878
- NO, NO, NOT A PARTY,
BUT, LIKE, AN ACTUAL CONCERT.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.786
SERIOUSLY, LIKE, HAVE IT JUST
BE A SPECIFIC EVENT

19:01.890 --> 19:04.654
TO RECORD THE SONG,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

19:04.760 --> 19:05.658
- IT COULD WORK.

19:05.760 --> 19:07.341
I MEAN THAT'S WHAT
THE BLACK CROWES DID

19:07.450 --> 19:08.417
ON BEFORE THE FROST,
AND THAT'S A DAMN GOOD ALBUM.

19:08.520 --> 19:10.067
- IT'S A GREAT ALBUM.
- AND I DON'T KNOW,

19:10.180 --> 19:11.454
I'LL ORGANIZE IT AND STUFF.

19:11.560 --> 19:14.449
I MEAN, I HAVE THEIR WEBSITE
FINISHED AND EVERYTHING.

19:14.560 --> 19:15.356
- YOU FINISHED THE WEBSITE?

19:15.460 --> 19:16.973
- HERE. YEAH.
- YOU MADE THIS?

19:17.080 --> 19:18.661
- YEAH, I MEAN ZACK HELPED,

19:18.770 --> 19:19.907
BUT, I MEAN, THIS IS WHAT
THEY WANTED.

19:20.020 --> 19:21.328
- THAT LOOKS GREAT.

19:21.430 --> 19:22.738
- I MEAN, I'LL ORGANIZE
THE WHOLE THING, YOU KNOW.

19:22.850 --> 19:24.568
I'LL DO SOCIAL MEDIA STUFF,
AND GET THE WORD OUT THERE,

19:24.680 --> 19:26.363
AND FIND PEOPLE,
AND I'LL GET DRINKS AND STUFF,

19:26.470 --> 19:28.051
I MEAN, IF YOU LIKE THE IDEA.

19:28.160 --> 19:30.845
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

19:30.960 --> 19:32.507
- WHY NOT?
I'M UP FOR IT.

19:32.610 --> 19:33.781
- ALL RIGHT,
LET'S GO FOR IT.

19:33.890 --> 19:34.788
- YEAH?
- LET'S DO IT.

19:34.890 --> 19:36.164
- YEAH?
- YEAH.

19:36.270 --> 19:37.783
- GREAT.

19:37.900 --> 19:39.060
- MAYBE WE COULD BRING MOM
AND DAD HERE AND SORT THIS OUT.

19:39.170 --> 19:41.377
- I DON'T KNOW,
BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND

19:41.490 --> 19:42.309
WHY THEY'RE TAKING
SEPARATE VACATIONS AT ALL.

19:42.420 --> 19:43.239
- HAVE THEY EVER DONE
THAT BEFORE?

19:43.350 --> 19:45.625
- NO, SOMETHING MUST
HAVE HAPPENED.

19:45.730 --> 19:47.379
- THEY'RE CLEARLY IN A FIGHT.
- YOU THINK THEY'RE IN A FIGHT?

19:47.490 --> 19:48.627
- YOU THINK THEY'RE HAVING
A FIGHT?

19:48.730 --> 19:49.480
- IT'S PROBABLY JUST
BECAUSE IT WASN'T DAD'S IDEA

19:49.600 --> 19:50.077
TO GO TO ITALY.
- "I'M MAD AT YOU.

19:50.180 --> 19:52.216
I'M GOING TO ITALY"?

19:52.320 --> 19:53.491
- ITALY'S OUTSIDE
OF DAD'S COMFORT ZONE.

19:53.600 --> 19:54.828
- LISTEN, HERE'S EXACTLY
WHAT'S HAPPENING.

19:54.950 --> 19:57.180
HE'S POUTING RIGHT NOW
BECAUSE HE PROBABLY SUGGESTED,

19:57.290 --> 19:59.497
LIKE, GOING ON
SOME BALLPARK TOUR OF AMERICA,

19:59.610 --> 20:01.089
AND SHE SAID "NO,"
AND NOW HE'S POUTING.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.326
- YEAH, WELL,
HE CAN BE PRETTY STUBBORN.

20:02.440 --> 20:03.771
- YEAH, BUT WHO POUTS
ABOUT ITALY?

20:03.890 --> 20:04.879
JUST GO.
- DAD.

20:04.990 --> 20:06.503
- I JUST THINK THE TIMING SUCKS
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,

20:06.610 --> 20:07.645
WHY IS SHE GOING NOW WHEN

20:07.750 --> 20:09.854
THERE'S A GRANDBABY
ON THE GROUND?

20:09.960 --> 20:11.166
SHE'S NOT EVEN GOING TO BE HERE?

20:11.270 --> 20:12.544
- THE GOOD NEWS IS DAD
CAN BABY-SIT.

20:12.650 --> 20:14.299
- OH, YEAH.
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

20:14.420 --> 20:15.682
- WITHOUT MOM?
- WHAT ABOUT SHOPPING?

20:15.800 --> 20:18.371
DAD DOESN'T EVEN KNOW
HOW THE GROCERY STORE WORKS.

20:18.490 --> 20:19.309
- YEAH, WE'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO SIT DOWN...

20:19.420 --> 20:21.797
- WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO MAKE A GRID.

20:21.910 --> 20:23.241
I DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR DAD'S SCHEDULE.

20:23.360 --> 20:24.691
- I DON'T WANT
TO GO CHECKING ON HIM.

20:24.800 --> 20:25.494
NO, HE'S A PAIN IN THE ASS.
- NO, I DON'T HAVE TIME.

20:25.600 --> 20:27.147
I'M A FREE-LANCE
PHOTOGRAPHER.

20:27.260 --> 20:28.079
YOU NEVER KNOW
WHEN THE DOGS ARE GOING TO CALL.

20:28.190 --> 20:29.976
- WHY IS THIS ALL ABOUT DAD?

20:30.090 --> 20:32.638
WHAT ABOUT MOM?

20:32.740 --> 20:34.560
WHAT ABOUT MOM,
WHO'S TAKEN CARE

20:34.680 --> 20:38.537
OF EVERYONE ELSE HER WHOLE LIFE?

20:38.650 --> 20:40.197
AND, LET ME TELL YOU,
DAD DOESN'T LISTEN TO HER.

20:40.300 --> 20:41.858
WHEN SHE TELLS HIM
WHAT SHE NEEDS,

20:41.960 --> 20:42.813
HE DOESN'T LISTEN TO HER.

20:42.930 --> 20:44.545
AND SO SHE'S DOING
SOMETHING FOR HERSELF

20:44.650 --> 20:46.618
FOR THE FIRST TIME PROBABLY IN,
YOU KNOW,

20:46.720 --> 20:48.028
HOWEVER LONG
THEY'VE BEEN TOGETHER.

20:48.140 --> 20:49.368
SO SHE'S GOING TO ITALY.

20:49.480 --> 20:51.061
DAD CAN DAMN WELL DEAL WITH IT,
AND SO CAN YOU.

20:51.180 --> 20:53.648
I'M GETTING SUGAR.

21:21.030 --> 21:22.713
- OH.
- OH.

21:22.830 --> 21:23.615
- HEY, NATS.
- OH, HEY, WHAT'S UP?

21:23.730 --> 21:26.722
- NOTHING,
I WAS JUST WALKING,

21:26.830 --> 21:29.390
AND MY SISTER, ACTUALLY,
IS DOING THIS THING

21:29.490 --> 21:31.173
AT THE LUNCHEONETTE,
THE RECORDING STUDIO...

21:31.290 --> 21:32.211
- YEAH, YEAH.

21:32.320 --> 21:33.480
- WELL, THEY'RE DOING THIS THING

21:33.600 --> 21:34.828
WHERE THEY'RE RECORDING
A BAND,

21:34.940 --> 21:36.567
LIKE, A LIVE PERFORMANCE
IN FRONT OF PEOPLE.

21:36.670 --> 21:38.069
- THAT SOUNDS COOL.
WHAT BAND?

21:38.190 --> 21:40.181
- THEY'RE CALLED
ASHES OF ROME.

21:40.290 --> 21:42.292
- YEAH, I DON'T KNOW THEM.

21:42.400 --> 21:43.674
- YOU'D PROBABLY LIKE IT,
THOUGH.

21:43.780 --> 21:45.839
I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY WE COULD
MEET THERE OR SOMETHING,

21:45.950 --> 21:47.292
IF YOU WANTED TO.
- YEAH, THAT SOUNDS COOL.

21:47.400 --> 21:48.469
I'M ACTUALLY GOING
TO BE LATE FOR CLASS,

21:48.580 --> 21:49.888
SO JUST, LIKE,
TEXT ME THE DEETS.

21:49.990 --> 21:51.196
WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT LATER.
- ALL RIGHT, SEE YOU.

21:51.310 --> 21:53.449
- WELL, LATER.

21:56.660 --> 21:58.230
- OH, OH.

21:58.350 --> 22:01.751
VICTOR, COME HERE, PLEASE.

22:01.870 --> 22:03.826
SYDNEY, I TOLD YOU
TO PUT YOUR CRAl-T STUFF AWAY.

22:03.940 --> 22:05.214
- IN A MINUTE.
WE'RE DOING SOMETHING.

22:05.320 --> 22:06.218
- NOW!
GET OVER HERE!

22:06.320 --> 22:08.106
I TOLD YOU THREE TIMES
TO PUT THIS AWAY!

22:08.220 --> 22:09.209
VICTOR,
THIS WAS ON THE STAIRS.

22:09.320 --> 22:10.241
I NEARLY DIED.

22:10.360 --> 22:13.284
THIS IS OUT OF CONTROL.

22:13.400 --> 22:15.493
YOU GUYS NEED
TO GET UPSTAIRS,

22:15.610 --> 22:18.078
AND PUT THIS STUFF AWAY
WHERE IT BELONGS.

22:18.190 --> 22:20.329
JUST--

22:20.440 --> 22:21.509
ALL RIGHT?

22:37.730 --> 22:38.549
- HEY.

22:38.660 --> 22:39.649
- JOEL.
- HANG ON ONE SECOND.

22:39.770 --> 22:41.169
- DO YOU WANT
THE EARLY GUYS OFF,

22:41.290 --> 22:42.314
OR ARE WE LOOKING
AT OVERTIME?

22:42.430 --> 22:43.146
- NO, NO THEY'RE DONE.

22:43.250 --> 22:44.217
- NO OVERTIME?

22:44.320 --> 22:45.252
- NO.
THANKS.

22:45.360 --> 22:47.180
HEY, IS THIS A BOOTY CALL?

22:47.290 --> 22:49.394
- NO.
THIS IS--NO, IT'S NOT.

22:49.500 --> 22:51.013
I'M SORRY.

22:51.120 --> 22:54.328
- WHAT IS IT?

22:54.440 --> 22:57.159
- THE KIDS' MESS,
I JUST--I LOST IT.

22:57.270 --> 22:58.339
I LOST IT IN A WHOLE NEW WAY.

22:58.440 --> 23:00.499
- I'M SURE IT WASN'T THAT BAD,
HONEY.

23:00.620 --> 23:01.507
- TRUST ME, I'M GIVING
THEM AMMUNITION

23:01.620 --> 23:03.952
FOR ANY FUTURE THERAPY
THEY MIGHT HAVE.

23:04.070 --> 23:04.991
IT WAS BAD.

23:05.100 --> 23:06.271
- JUST BE FIRM, YOU KNOW.

23:06.380 --> 23:08.655
NO SCREEN TIME UNTIL THEIR
ROOM'S IN ORDER, THAT'S IT.

23:08.760 --> 23:11.274
OR TAKE THEM TO YOUR DAD'S
IF YOU NEED A BREAK.

23:11.390 --> 23:13.415
HE'S GREAT WITH THEM.

23:13.530 --> 23:16.101
- IT'S NOT JUST THE KIDS,
BABE, IT'S ME.

23:16.220 --> 23:19.872
I'M--I'M LOSING IT A LITTLE BIT.

23:19.980 --> 23:21.629
- JOEL, MY GUYS ARE
SUPPOSED TO GET OVERTIME.

23:21.740 --> 23:23.082
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- I KNOW, I KNOW, GABE.

23:23.190 --> 23:24.976
JUST--LET ME JUST,
CAN YOU GIVE ME ONE SECOND?

23:25.090 --> 23:27.399
ONE SECOND, BUDDY.
SORRY.

23:27.500 --> 23:28.888
HON, I'M SORRY.

23:28.990 --> 23:33.950
I KNOW IT'S STRESSFUL,
AND I'VE BEEN THERE.

23:34.060 --> 23:37.120

23:37.240 --> 23:38.161
- YEAH, I'M FINE.

23:38.270 --> 23:39.134
I'LL LET YOU GO.

23:39.240 --> 23:43.415
LOVE YOU.

23:43.520 --> 23:46.580
[cell phone dings]

23:48.250 --> 23:51.174
- [laughs]

23:55.980 --> 23:57.629
- OKAY.

23:57.740 --> 24:00.948
LITTLE NORA'S ALL SITUATED
FOR HER DADDY DAY.

24:01.060 --> 24:03.369
THANK YOU
FOR HELPING FACILITATE THAT.

24:03.470 --> 24:05.506
I THINK I HAVE
A COUPLE OF MINUTES

24:05.610 --> 24:09.057
BEFORE HEATHER
GETS A HOLD OF ME.

24:09.170 --> 24:10.546
- SORRY.
I'M SO OUT OF IT.

24:10.650 --> 24:12.333
I--DO YOU WANT SOMETHING
TO DRINK?

24:12.450 --> 24:13.712
I HAVEN'T EVEN BEEN--

24:13.830 --> 24:14.785
- OH, NO, I'M GOOD.
I'M COFFEE-ED OUT.

24:14.900 --> 24:15.969
I'VE HAD TWO CUPS.
- ARE YOU SURE?

24:16.070 --> 24:17.037
- YEAH.
HOW ARE YOU?

24:17.140 --> 24:18.061
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

24:18.180 --> 24:19.067
- I'M OKAY.
- YEAH?

24:19.180 --> 24:20.932
I'M A LITTLE STRESSED.

24:21.040 --> 24:21.893
- I KNOW.

24:22.010 --> 24:23.147
PLANNING A WEDDING
IS A BIG DEAL.

24:23.250 --> 24:23.966
- YEAH.
- IT'S A LOT OF WORK.

24:24.080 --> 24:25.149
- AND YOU KNOW,
IT'S JUST THAT,

24:25.250 --> 24:26.421
ON TOP OF, LIKE, DEALING
WITH THE BAND STUFF,

24:26.530 --> 24:29.181
AND WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT WE WANT TO DO,

24:29.290 --> 24:33.841
AND I I DON'T KNOW--IT'S JUST
BEEN, IT'S LIKE, STRESSFUL.

24:33.950 --> 24:35.360
- CRAZY.
IT'S VERY STRESSFUL.

24:35.470 --> 24:38.598
- WAS IT LIKE THIS FOR YOU?
- PLANNING?

24:38.710 --> 24:40.154
- I DON'T EVEN KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT IT.

24:40.270 --> 24:43.740
HOW DID HE EVEN PROPOSE?

24:43.860 --> 24:44.849
- YOU REALLY WANT
TO HEAR THAT STORY?

24:44.960 --> 24:46.507
- YEAH.
- I MEAN, IT'S A GREAT STORY.

24:46.620 --> 24:48.133
I LOVE TELLING IT.

24:48.240 --> 24:51.346
IT'S--GOSH, I FEEL LIKE IT
WAS, LIKE, A LIFETIME AGO.

24:51.450 --> 24:55.204
I WAS SO YOUNG.
WE WERE BOTH SO YOUNG.

24:55.320 --> 25:00.098
HE ACTUALLY PROPOSED TO ME
THE DAY Al-TER VALENTINE'S DAY.

25:00.220 --> 25:01.141
LIKE, WHO DOES THAT?

25:01.250 --> 25:02.148
BUT IT WAS SO SWEET

25:02.250 --> 25:03.319
BECAUSE HE KNEW HOW MUCH
I HATED VALENTINE'S DAY.

25:03.430 --> 25:06.945
I THINK IT'S, LIKE--
I DON'T KNOW, SO MANUFACTURED,

25:07.050 --> 25:09.530
AND FAKE, AND JUST,
LIKE, FOR EVERYBODY ELSE.

25:09.640 --> 25:14.577
SO HE DECIDED TO ASK ME
TO MARRY HIM ON THE 15TH.

25:14.680 --> 25:15.908
GOD, IT WAS SO COOL.

25:16.030 --> 25:19.409
IT WAS LIKE,
BOTH IN GRAD SCHOOL.

25:19.510 --> 25:21.330
YOU KNOW, WE'D ONLY BEEN LIVING
TOGETHER FOR ABOUT A MONTH.

25:21.450 --> 25:25.307
AND WE WOKE UP
EARLY ONE MORNING,

25:25.420 --> 25:27.729
AND IT WAS JUST
THIS REALLY GRAY,

25:27.830 --> 25:29.866
AND SORT OF RAINY,
ROMANTIC MORNING,

25:29.970 --> 25:31.961
AND
WE WERE LYING IN BED,

25:32.080 --> 25:36.665
THE TWO OF US,
AND LISTENING TO THE RAIN,

25:36.770 --> 25:39.523
AND HE REACHED OUT,
AND GRABBED MY HAND,

25:39.640 --> 25:44.418
AND HE ASKED ME IF I WOULD SPEND
THE REST OF MY LIFE WITH HIM.

25:44.540 --> 25:48.704
IT WAS SO SIMPLE, AND JUST
SO PURE, AND, SOUNDS CORNY,

25:48.820 --> 25:51.288
BUT IT WAS JUST BEAUTIFUL,

25:51.410 --> 25:54.231
AND IT JUST MADE SENSE.

25:54.340 --> 25:56.570
I MEAN, I'M SURE YOU FEEL
THE SAME ABOUT RYAN,

25:56.690 --> 26:00.649
AND IT'S SOMETHING

FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH, I DON'T
WANT YOU TO SELL THE HOUSE.

34:27.720 --> 34:29.745
OKAY, BUT MAYBE WE CAN ALLOW MOM
A LITTLE SPACE TO JUST BE

34:29.860 --> 34:33.682
ABLE TO INTRODUCE THIS
FOR CONVERSATION, YOU KNOW?

34:33.790 --> 34:36.350
PLENTY OF COUPLES YOUR AGE
THINK ABOUT DOWNSIZING.

34:36.450 --> 34:37.894
- OH, NOW WAIT A MINUTE.
DID YOU SAY "OUR AGE"?

34:38.000 --> 34:39.968
- I DID.

34:40.070 --> 34:41.344
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN,
COUPLES "OUR AGE"?

34:41.450 --> 34:42.587
- YOU KNOW WHAT I'M
TALKING ABOUT, OKAY.

34:42.700 --> 34:43.621
SHE'S NOT COMING FROM
OUTER SPACE, HERE.

34:43.730 --> 34:45.413
IT'S, LIKE, PEOPLE
DO THAT, AND, LOOK,

34:45.530 --> 34:46.929
MAYBE YOU CAN JUST TABLE
THE HOUSE FOR RIGHT NOW,

34:47.050 --> 34:49.666
AND YOU CAN JUST
GO TO ITALY.

34:49.770 --> 34:51.704
HAVE THIS ADVENTURE
WITH YOUR WIFE, AND, YOU KNOW,

34:51.810 --> 34:53.425
THIS WILL BE HERE
FOR YOU WHEN YOU GET BACK,

34:53.530 --> 34:56.465
AND YOU CAN DEAL WITH IT,
BUT, DAD, YOU CAN GO AWAY.

34:56.570 --> 34:57.912
GET A LITTLE TIME,
A LITTLE PERSPECTIVE.

34:58.020 --> 34:59.942
- OH, COME ON, I'VE GOT
A LIFETIME OF PERSPECTIVE.

35:00.060 --> 35:01.504
I DON'T NEED PERSPECTIVE.
- GOD, DAD.

35:01.610 --> 35:02.360
I'M JUST ASKING YOU
TO SUCK IT UP AND BE A MAN,

35:02.470 --> 35:03.914
AND GO TO ITALY
WITH YOUR WIFE.

35:04.030 --> 35:06.260
- WHAT--YOU TELLING ME
TO SUCK IT UP?

35:06.380 --> 35:07.028
YOU'RE TALKING TO
YOUR FATHER LIKE THAT?

35:07.130 --> 35:09.132
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.

35:09.240 --> 35:12.061
I WILL TELL YOU THE REAL REASON
I'M NOT GOING.

35:12.170 --> 35:13.205
- OKAY, TELL ME.
- OKAY, OKAY.

35:13.310 --> 35:14.516
I'LL TELL YOU WHY.

35:14.620 --> 35:17.828
I WAS NOT INVITED.

35:26.910 --> 35:28.184
- [sighs]

35:37.200 --> 35:38.167
- HMM.

35:49.630 --> 35:52.349
[phone rings]

35:52.460 --> 35:53.245
- HELLO.

35:53.350 --> 35:55.352
- HEY, IT'S JULIA.
- HEY.

35:55.460 --> 35:57.041
- I'M SORRY I DIDN'T
CALL YOU BACK UNTIL NOW.

35:57.150 --> 36:00.074
I ACTUALLY JUST FOUND
YOUR MESSAGES NOW.

36:00.190 --> 36:01.873
- THAT'S COOL.
HOW ARE YOU?

36:01.980 --> 36:04.039
- OH, FINE.

36:04.160 --> 36:05.809
JOB HUNTING,

36:05.920 --> 36:08.388
DOING A FEW THINGS AROUND THE
HOUSE BEFORE I PICK UP THE KIDS.

36:08.510 --> 36:09.738
- UH-HUH.

36:09.850 --> 36:10.839
HOW ARE YOU?

36:15.170 --> 36:18.515
- REALLY NOT GOOD.

36:18.620 --> 36:20.679
AND DON'T TELL ME THAT
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.

36:20.790 --> 36:23.998
- I WOULD NEVER TELL YOU THAT,
"'CAUSE IT'S NOT," SAYS MY WIFE.

36:24.110 --> 36:25.725
SORRY.
THAT WAS LOW HANGING FRUIT.

36:25.830 --> 36:28.003
SHE'S ACTUALLY THE OPTIMIST
AROUND THIS HOUSE.

36:28.110 --> 36:30.351
SO WHAT'S GOING ON?
- I DON'T KNOW.

36:30.460 --> 36:31.427
I'M ALL OVER THE PLACE.

36:31.530 --> 36:34.977
I'M EITHER YELLING
AT MY KIDS,

36:35.080 --> 36:36.490
NOT COMMUNICATING
WITH MY HUSBAND

36:36.600 --> 36:38.773
IN THE TEN MINUTE WINDOWS
THAT WE HAVE,

36:38.880 --> 36:41.701
GENERALLY MAKING EVERYONE
MISERABLE INCLUDING MYSELF.

36:41.820 --> 36:43.128
THIS IS SOUNDING
WAY WORSE THAN I INTENDED,

36:43.230 --> 36:47.746
BUT IT'S BEEN A ROUGH WEEK.

36:47.860 --> 36:51.023
- YEAH, SAME HERE,
AND THEN MY PHONE RANG,

36:51.130 --> 36:53.644
AND IT SUDDENLY
GOT A LOT BETTER.

37:04.910 --> 37:06.002
- OH.
HELLO.

37:06.120 --> 37:07.382
- YEAH, I'M GONNA
MAKE THIS QUICK,

37:07.500 --> 37:08.455
AND I'M NOT GONNA COME IN.

37:08.570 --> 37:10.219
- I DIDN'T ASK YOU IN.

37:10.330 --> 37:12.560
- YEAH, UH, I WAS THINKING
ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID,

37:12.670 --> 37:15.980
ABOUT MAX, AND THE WHOLE
"BEST FRIEND" THING.

37:16.090 --> 37:19.298
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW--
FRIENDS, BEST FRIENDS, I DON'T--

37:19.400 --> 37:22.437
LABELS, THAT'S NOT ME.

37:22.550 --> 37:24.302
I LIKE HIM.
I LIKE MAX.

37:24.410 --> 37:26.617
SMART, TALENTED KID,
YOU KNOW,

37:26.720 --> 37:28.893
AND HE'S A CAMERA NERD,
LIKE I USED TO BE.

37:29.000 --> 37:30.752
- USED TO BE?

37:30.860 --> 37:31.201
- YOU STILL GOT IT.

37:31.310 --> 37:34.131
LOOK, HE'S EAGER.

37:34.250 --> 37:36.889
GOD, HE'S EAGER, THIS KID.

37:37.010 --> 37:39.217
I'M NOT SAYING
HE DOESN'T HAVE HIS MOMENTS,

37:39.320 --> 37:41.459
BUT I'M SHOWING HIM
THE ROPES,

37:41.560 --> 37:45.041
AND IT'S GOOD FOR HIM.

37:45.150 --> 37:47.289
AND IT'S GOOD FOR ME.

37:51.890 --> 37:54.199
SO THE KID STAYS.

37:54.300 --> 37:55.153
- THANK YOU.
- YEAH.

37:55.270 --> 37:59.809
- GOOD, THANK YOU.

37:59.930 --> 38:01.955
- AND BY THE WAY,
THERE WERE, LIKE, SEVEN OR EIGHT

38:02.070 --> 38:03.094
OTHER PICTURES OF YOU
I HAD SCATTERED AROUND.

38:03.210 --> 38:05.440
I GOT RID OF THEM
SO YOU WON'T COME UP

38:05.550 --> 38:07.302
IN CONVERSATION ANYMORE.

38:07.420 --> 38:09.627
- SHUT UP.

38:09.730 --> 38:11.209
- ALL RIGHT.
WHAT DID YOU DO?

38:11.320 --> 38:13.629
YOU DID YOUR HAIR DIFFERENT?

38:13.730 --> 38:14.970
IS YOUR HAI|\RIODIFFERENT?

38:15.080 --> 38:16.069
- OR YOUR TEETH--
DID YOU DO--

38:16.190 --> 38:18.215
- DID I DO MY TEETH DIFFERENT?

38:18.330 --> 38:19.945
NO, THEY'RE JUST MY TEETH.

38:20.050 --> 38:22.939
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
- I'M TRYING TO GET OUT.

38:23.050 --> 38:24.119
- OH, OKAY.

38:24.230 --> 38:26.084
- ALL RIGHT.
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

38:26.200 --> 38:27.986
- YOU JUST SAY GOOD-BYE.

38:28.090 --> 38:29.466
- OKAY.
NO PEEKING, ALL RIGHT?

38:29.580 --> 38:31.719
- RYAN, WHAT IS THIS?

38:31.820 --> 38:32.570
I'M STRESSED OUT.
- DON'T LOOK!

38:32.680 --> 38:33.123
ARE YOU LOOKING?
- OKAY, I'M NOT.

38:33.240 --> 38:34.332
I DIDN'T.

38:40.930 --> 38:41.100
- OKAY,
OPEN THEM.

38:46.420 --> 38:48.172
_ THE FIRST TIME I ASKED YOU,
IT WAS IMPULSIVE,

38:48.290 --> 38:50.554
AND IT WAS SPUR
OF THE MOMENT,

38:50.670 --> 38:53.423
AND SINCE THEN I'VE HAD NOTHING
BUT TIME TO THINK ABOUT IT,

38:53.530 --> 38:56.351
AND I COULDN'T BE MORE SURE.

38:56.470 --> 38:59.109
MY LIFE CHANGED THE DAY
THAT I MET YOU,

38:59.230 --> 39:03.121
AND I DON'T WANT TO SPEND
ANOTHER DAY OF IT WITHOUT YOU.

39:03.230 --> 39:04.436
I LOVE YOU.

39:04.540 --> 39:05.950
I WANT YOU TO BE MY WIFE.

39:09.690 --> 39:10.645
- RYAN.

39:10.760 --> 39:13.649
- WHAT?
- THAT'S--WE CAN'T AFFORD THIS.

39:13.760 --> 39:16.445
- YES, OF COURSE WE COULD.
I SPENT MY COMBAT PAY ON IT.

39:16.560 --> 39:19.381
I WANTED TO SPEND IT ON
THE RIGHT THING, AND THIS IS IT.

39:19.490 --> 39:22.072
- THAT'S--THAT'S TOO MUCH.

39:22.180 --> 39:23.454
- NO, NO, NO.

39:23.560 --> 39:25.289
I GET EXTRA PAY
FOR ACTIVE DUTY,

39:25.390 --> 39:26.948
AND I WAS SAVING IT UP.

39:27.050 --> 39:27.971
I WANTED TO--

39:28.080 --> 39:29.638
- ARE YOU SURE?

39:29.740 --> 39:32.152
- I'VE NEVER BEEN SO SURE
OF ANYTHING, EVER.

39:32.260 --> 39:35.297
- HONEY, I--

39:35.400 --> 39:37.846
- IT'S OFFICIAL, ALL RIGHT?

39:44.690 --> 39:46.373
- HEY.

39:46.480 --> 39:49.278
- HEY, YOU.

39:49.380 --> 39:52.486
UM, YOU GONNA INVITE ME IN?

39:52.590 --> 39:54.626
OR SHOULD WE DO
ANOTHER ONE OF THESE?

39:54.730 --> 39:56.038
- OH, ALL RIGHT, YEAH.
- POUND THAT?

39:56.150 --> 40:00.041
- HA, HA, GREAT.

40:00.150 --> 40:01.424
I'M CONFUSED.

40:01.530 --> 40:03.589
HONESTLY, I MEAN...

40:03.710 --> 40:06.804
WE'RE FRIENDS, YOU KNOW.

40:06.920 --> 40:10.742
WE'RE ALSO MORE
THAN FRIENDS, YOU KNOW,

40:10.850 --> 40:12.260
AND YOU DON'T WANT
A BOYFRIEND,

40:12.370 --> 40:15.988
BUT THEN ALSO, YOU'RE HERE.

40:16.100 --> 40:18.239
- YES.

40:18.340 --> 40:20.968
- I GUESS I SHOULD
JUST STOP TALKING.

40:21.070 --> 40:21.991
- MM-HMM.

40:39.780 --> 40:41.259
- I DON'T KNOW WHY
YOU WON'T LET ME TAKE YOU.

40:41.360 --> 40:42.463
THERE'S STILL TIME, YOU KNOW.

40:42.570 --> 40:44.083
- BECAUSE THIS IS SO MUCH
EASIER,

40:44.200 --> 40:45.849
AND YOU GET TO GO BACK TO BED.

40:45.960 --> 40:48.474
- RIGHT.

40:48.580 --> 40:52.402
WELL, OKAY, WELL, I GUESS
IT'S ARRIVEDERCI

40:52.510 --> 40:53.329
OR CIAOOR WHATEVER.

40:53.450 --> 40:57.443
- JUST THESE TWO?
- YES, THAT'S IT.

40:57.550 --> 41:01.316
TRAVELING LIGHT.

41:01.420 --> 41:02.694
OKAY.

41:02.800 --> 41:04.654
LET ME JUST CHECK
I'VE GOT EVERYTHING.

41:04.770 --> 41:05.282
TICKETS, MY GLASSES.

41:05.390 --> 41:06.311
I'M GOOD.

41:06.420 --> 41:11.289
- YEAH.

41:11.390 --> 41:12.493
- OKAY.

41:29.310 --> 41:31.585
- OKAY.

41:31.690 --> 41:33.169
YOU BE CAREFUL, NELLIE.

41:58.550 --> 42:01.610
[security alarm wails]

42:04.520 --> 42:06.306
OH, COME ON.

42:06.420 --> 42:08.308
OH, MY GOD.

42:14.350 --> 42:16.045
[sighs]
