00:14.182 --> 00:16.450
[Tyler] My name is Tyler Austin,

00:16.484 --> 00:20.288
and this is my best friend
in the whole world, Robo-Dog.

00:20.321 --> 00:23.224
He may look like a normal dog,
but he's actually a robot,

00:23.257 --> 00:25.293
with some really cool gadgets,

00:25.326 --> 00:26.794
like a robotic hand.

00:28.229 --> 00:31.432
He also has cool powers
like super-speed.

00:32.833 --> 00:34.702
Oh, and did I mention that he can talk?

00:34.735 --> 00:36.304
I am Robo-Dog.

00:36.310 --> 00:37.604
[Tyler] Robo-Dog is the best,

00:37.605 --> 00:41.442
and I can't imagine ever
being apart from him.

00:46.647 --> 00:49.350
(proud music)

01:09.203 --> 01:10.571
Let's do this.

01:10.604 --> 01:13.341
(powerful music)

01:20.148 --> 01:22.450
Ready to test Robo-Dog, Tyler?

01:26.454 --> 01:27.288
Ready.

01:29.423 --> 01:30.424
Barry.

01:30.458 --> 01:32.860
Are you ready to test Robo-Dog?

01:32.893 --> 01:35.563
Hold on, technical difficulties.

01:35.596 --> 01:37.765
Is that thing recording?

01:39.400 --> 01:42.436
(bumbling music)

01:42.470 --> 01:43.304
Hold on.

01:45.406 --> 01:48.342
I got you guys in slow motion mode

01:48.376 --> 01:50.678
and I don't know how to get it off.

01:50.711 --> 01:51.645
No no no.

01:51.679 --> 01:53.314
Just stop recording

01:53.347 --> 01:55.849
and you just swipe the button.

01:55.883 --> 01:57.485
How hard can it be?

02:00.754 --> 02:03.724
Barry, you put your finger on the button

02:03.757 --> 02:05.393
and you swipe it.

02:06.460 --> 02:08.795
Tom, I'm swiping it.

02:08.829 --> 02:11.332
May I be of some assistance?

02:12.333 --> 02:14.168
Oh, you swipe.

02:14.202 --> 02:15.436
Thanks, Robo-Dog.

02:15.469 --> 02:17.338
Right, and continue.

02:18.306 --> 02:20.541
Gentlemen, you're about
to witness the initial test

02:20.574 --> 02:22.510
of Robo-Dog Upgrade 42,

02:23.511 --> 02:25.346
a little program I like to refer to

02:25.379 --> 02:28.449
as the Wilbur and Orville program.

02:28.482 --> 02:29.817
Oh, the popcorn guys?

02:29.850 --> 02:31.819
Did you install a popcorn machine?

02:31.852 --> 02:33.451
That would actually
be a pretty good idea.

02:33.454 --> 02:34.622
Next time, Tyler.

02:34.655 --> 02:36.824
Guys, I'm referring to
the Wright brothers.

02:36.857 --> 02:37.725
Tom, I'm pretty sure

02:37.758 --> 02:39.493
they didn't invent the popcorn machine.

02:39.527 --> 02:41.629
Barry, let's forget about
popcorn for the moment,

02:41.662 --> 02:43.964
because I'm trying to share
something extremely cool

02:43.997 --> 02:45.966
with you guys.

02:45.999 --> 02:47.801
Robo-Dog, are you ready?

02:47.835 --> 02:49.303
Affirmative.

02:49.337 --> 02:50.334
Guys, hold on to your hats,

02:50.338 --> 02:53.374
because things are about
to get a little crazy.

02:53.407 --> 02:56.210
Initiating Robo-Dog Upgrade 42.

02:59.480 --> 03:00.881
Wow!

03:00.914 --> 03:02.450
In...

03:02.483 --> 03:03.684
Three,

03:03.717 --> 03:04.752
two,

03:04.785 --> 03:05.619
one,

03:06.520 --> 03:07.355
ignite.

03:09.490 --> 03:10.291
Whoa!

03:10.324 --> 03:12.260
Dad, that's so awesome!

03:12.293 --> 03:13.761
You think that's awesome, Tyler?

03:13.794 --> 03:14.795
Watch this.

03:14.828 --> 03:15.896
Robo-Dog, go!

03:20.301 --> 03:22.303
Yeah, go Robo-Dog!

03:22.336 --> 03:24.438
(Tom laughs)

03:24.472 --> 03:27.308
(Robo-Dog laughs)

03:29.377 --> 03:30.210
Yikes.

03:31.712 --> 03:32.580
[Robo-Dog] All right!

03:32.613 --> 03:33.914
(alarm beeping)

03:33.947 --> 03:34.782
Uh-oh.

03:35.983 --> 03:36.784
What happened?

03:36.817 --> 03:37.651
Oh no!

03:39.019 --> 03:40.554
Jiminy jumper nuts!

03:40.588 --> 03:44.425
One of his gyroscopes is malfunctioning.

03:44.458 --> 03:46.527
Robo-Dog, come home, now!

03:46.560 --> 03:47.728
Affirmative!

03:50.631 --> 03:52.300
Dad, do something!

03:52.333 --> 03:54.902
All right, son, how about this?

03:56.304 --> 03:57.638
[Robo-Dog] Whoa!

03:57.671 --> 03:59.473
I cannot stop!

03:59.507 --> 04:00.574
[Tom And Tyler] Duck!

04:00.608 --> 04:02.476
[Robo-Dog] Look out!

04:02.510 --> 04:05.446
(troubled music)

04:09.483 --> 04:10.551
I'm okay.

04:10.584 --> 04:11.419
I'm okay.

04:14.054 --> 04:17.491
(Robo-Dog screams)

04:17.524 --> 04:19.793
(crashing)

04:23.397 --> 04:24.031
Oh no.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.936
That's one big hole.

04:31.339 --> 04:32.272
Robo-Dog!

04:36.410 --> 04:37.678
That was fun.

04:37.711 --> 04:38.546
Again!

04:40.581 --> 04:42.383
All things considered,

04:42.416 --> 04:44.051
I think that that was quite success...

04:44.084 --> 04:45.553
Skittles!

04:45.586 --> 04:47.087
Ful.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.789
Robo-Dog, are you okay?

04:48.822 --> 04:51.024
Better than ever.

04:51.058 --> 04:54.094
I think you should've gone
with the popcorn machine.

04:54.127 --> 04:55.028
Okay.

04:55.062 --> 04:58.866
The new rule is no
flying until I fix you.

04:58.899 --> 05:01.802
The good news is all we
have to do is fix your gyro

05:01.835 --> 05:04.037
and you should be fine.

05:04.071 --> 05:04.905
Gyros.

05:05.739 --> 05:07.641
Lunch, anybody?

05:07.675 --> 05:08.509
Lunch!

05:11.011 --> 05:12.112
What time is it?

05:12.145 --> 05:15.916
The time is 11:15am and 37 seconds.

05:15.949 --> 05:17.385
[Tyler And Tom] 11:15?!

05:17.418 --> 05:19.453
And 39 seconds.

05:19.487 --> 05:21.389
The science fair, we gotta go!

05:21.422 --> 05:23.023
I can fly us.

05:23.056 --> 05:25.393
Robo-Dog, what did I just tell you?

05:25.426 --> 05:28.429
Right, no flying until I fix you.

05:28.462 --> 05:29.363
Let's go!

05:31.699 --> 05:32.766
Where you guys headed?

05:32.800 --> 05:34.735
I gotta present my
invention at the science fair.

05:34.768 --> 05:35.736
Wanna come?

05:35.769 --> 05:36.637
I can't.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.105
I have an event that I have to attend,

05:38.138 --> 05:40.007
but good luck though.

05:40.040 --> 05:41.375
Thanks, Barry.

05:43.544 --> 05:46.447
Dad, what about the pothole?

05:46.480 --> 05:47.415
Right.

05:47.448 --> 05:48.449
Don't you guys worry.

05:48.482 --> 05:49.550
I'll take care of it.

05:49.583 --> 05:52.453
Got the perfect thing in my car.

05:53.454 --> 05:55.088
Do you really think that we
should trust Barry to do this?

05:55.122 --> 05:56.924
Definitely not, son,

05:56.957 --> 05:58.392
but we're late.

06:05.699 --> 06:08.368
(bemused music)

06:21.715 --> 06:22.750
(tires squealing)

06:22.783 --> 06:25.118
(crashing)

06:25.152 --> 06:26.687
What the heck?

06:28.956 --> 06:30.691
Hey, did you do this?

06:37.898 --> 06:39.433
All you have to do is
input someone's voice

06:39.467 --> 06:40.768
and you can find them?

06:40.801 --> 06:41.702
Yeah.

06:41.735 --> 06:44.438
For example, speak into this microphone.

06:44.472 --> 06:45.105
Hello.

06:46.474 --> 06:47.908
Now speak again.

06:47.941 --> 06:49.142
Speaking again.

06:49.176 --> 06:52.112
(device beeping)

06:53.180 --> 06:55.583
Ah, see, found just where you were.

06:55.616 --> 06:56.383
Interesting.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.118
How far can you go with this thing?

06:58.151 --> 07:00.454
I've tested it up for six miles.

07:00.488 --> 07:02.923
Very impressive, young man.

07:11.499 --> 07:15.469
We've conferred, and congratulations,

07:15.503 --> 07:17.170
you won first place in the science fair!

07:17.204 --> 07:18.105
[Tyler] Really?

07:18.138 --> 07:20.741
(applauding)

07:24.545 --> 07:26.213
(splatting)

07:26.246 --> 07:28.582
You get to go to the state
science fair next week.

07:28.616 --> 07:30.017
Thank you.

07:30.050 --> 07:31.585
Did you see that?

07:31.619 --> 07:32.452
Yes!

07:33.286 --> 07:34.855
Great job, Tyler.

07:34.888 --> 07:36.256
Is first place a good thing?

07:36.289 --> 07:38.025
Yeah, that means I get
to show off my invention

07:38.058 --> 07:40.861
at the state science fair.

07:40.894 --> 07:44.031
Hey, congratulations, Tyler.

07:44.064 --> 07:45.899
Barry, what are you doing here?

07:45.933 --> 07:49.537
Oh, I'm one of the sponsors
of the science fair, see.

07:49.570 --> 07:52.272
(amused music)

07:52.305 --> 07:54.174
That's weird.

07:54.207 --> 07:55.275
Melch-Andise?

07:55.308 --> 07:59.279
It's the word merchandise,
but with my name in it.

07:59.312 --> 08:00.080
Very creative.

08:00.113 --> 08:01.081
Sorry to bother you, Mr. Melch,

08:01.114 --> 08:03.283
but could you sign my
solar-powered spatula?

08:03.316 --> 08:04.618
Sure thing.

08:06.720 --> 08:09.056
And my solar-powered Frisbee?

08:09.089 --> 08:10.758
I love your infomercials.

08:10.791 --> 08:12.626
[Barry] Thank you.

08:12.660 --> 08:13.727
Selfie!

08:13.761 --> 08:16.229
(bemused music)

08:20.300 --> 08:22.836
Barry, you have quite a fan base.

08:22.870 --> 08:24.905
Only at things like this.

08:24.938 --> 08:26.907
May I have a photo too please?

08:26.940 --> 08:28.275
Oh, of course.

08:29.677 --> 08:30.510
Selfie.

08:32.980 --> 08:34.181
Thanks, Barry.

08:34.214 --> 08:35.048
How come you didn't tell us

08:35.082 --> 08:37.116
you were coming to the science fair?

08:37.150 --> 08:40.921
Oh, you meant you were
coming to this science fair.

08:40.953 --> 08:42.089
Makes sense.

08:42.121 --> 08:44.224
That's really cool that
you're one of the sponsors.

08:44.256 --> 08:45.826
Oh, that reminds me,

08:45.859 --> 08:47.094
I gotta give you your very own

08:47.127 --> 08:49.663
official Melch-andise Enterprises
gift pack

08:49.697 --> 08:52.132
for winning first place
at the science fair,

08:52.165 --> 08:54.835
and it even comes with your very own

08:54.868 --> 08:57.705
limited edition solar-powered spatula.

08:57.738 --> 08:59.239
Oh, thank you.

08:59.272 --> 09:00.107
[Barry] You're welcome.

09:00.140 --> 09:01.174
Limited edition.

09:01.208 --> 09:03.644
First place is a good thing.

09:03.677 --> 09:06.146
What do you say we celebrate
this momentous occasion

09:06.179 --> 09:07.280
with some dinner?

09:07.314 --> 09:08.816
[Tyler] Yeah, totally.

09:08.849 --> 09:09.850
Doughnuts.

09:20.127 --> 09:22.295
Wow, wonder who this is.

09:25.265 --> 09:27.167
Tom, so good to see you.

09:27.200 --> 09:28.168
Mr. Soto!

09:28.201 --> 09:30.003
What are you doing here?

09:30.037 --> 09:31.872
I have a very special business associate

09:31.905 --> 09:34.174
who would like to meet you.

09:35.275 --> 09:36.176
Tom Austin.

09:37.811 --> 09:41.048
I have been waiting to
finally meet you in person.

09:41.081 --> 09:44.151
It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.

09:44.184 --> 09:44.985
Who are you?

09:45.018 --> 09:45.986
Forgive me.

09:46.019 --> 09:47.220
I'm Dr. William Rants,

09:47.254 --> 09:50.323
Chairman of the World Science
and Technology Association.

09:50.357 --> 09:52.993
The Dr. William Rants.

09:53.026 --> 09:55.328
Tyler, this man is a legend.

09:55.362 --> 09:56.997
He is single-handedly responsible

09:57.030 --> 09:59.366
for the advancement of
artificial intelligence.

09:59.399 --> 10:03.003
I assure you, I had plenty
of people to help get me there.

10:03.036 --> 10:04.204
Wow.

10:04.237 --> 10:05.038
Let me introduce you.

10:05.072 --> 10:06.139
This is my son, Tyler.

10:06.173 --> 10:07.174
[Dr. Rants] Hello.

10:07.207 --> 10:08.275
Hi.

10:08.308 --> 10:10.243
[Tom] And this is our
very strange friend, Barry.

10:10.277 --> 10:11.244
Greetings.

10:11.278 --> 10:12.813
And this is...

10:12.846 --> 10:14.114
Robo-Dog.

10:14.147 --> 10:16.183
I am Robo-Dog.

10:16.216 --> 10:17.217
Wow.

10:17.250 --> 10:19.052
Shake hands, Robo-Dog.

10:19.086 --> 10:20.087
Of course.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.855
Where are my manners?

10:22.990 --> 10:24.291
Amazing.

10:24.324 --> 10:26.259
Even more impressive in person.

10:26.293 --> 10:27.260
Thank you.

10:27.294 --> 10:29.997
You're quite the hero
in the robotics world.

10:30.030 --> 10:31.198
You should be very proud.

10:31.231 --> 10:34.835
Dr. Rants, coming from you,
that is such a compliment.

10:34.868 --> 10:37.738
I just wanted to personally invite you

10:37.771 --> 10:38.872
to be our guest speaker

10:38.906 --> 10:43.143
at the World Science and
Technology Summit in New York.

10:44.011 --> 10:44.912
Guest speaker?

10:44.945 --> 10:46.246
[Dr. Rants] Yes, sir.

10:46.279 --> 10:49.182
I don't know what to say.

10:49.216 --> 10:50.050
Say yes.

10:51.018 --> 10:52.019
Okay, yes.

10:52.920 --> 10:53.754
Yes!

10:53.787 --> 10:54.988
Great!

10:55.022 --> 10:57.224
I'll have my people arrange
flights for you and your family,

10:57.257 --> 10:58.992
and of course, Robo-Dog,

10:59.026 --> 11:01.428
and I expect him to be
part of your presentation?

11:01.461 --> 11:03.330
Oh yes, of course.

11:03.363 --> 11:04.264
Great.

11:04.297 --> 11:05.933
Nice to have met you all.

11:05.966 --> 11:07.367
Nice to meet you.

11:09.036 --> 11:10.738
Good job, Tom.

11:10.771 --> 11:12.072
Thanks, Mr. Soto.

11:12.105 --> 11:13.741
See you next week.

11:13.774 --> 11:17.210
That's right, I will see you next week!

11:18.779 --> 11:21.048
Tyler, what day is the science fair?

11:21.081 --> 11:22.082
April 2nd.

11:27.354 --> 11:28.188
Well.

11:35.395 --> 11:36.596
With your mother out of town,

11:36.629 --> 11:40.100
how in the jiminy jumper nuts
are we gonna make this work?

11:40.133 --> 11:42.402
Barry could always take me.

11:42.435 --> 11:43.236
Huh?

11:43.270 --> 11:44.271
Oh.

11:44.304 --> 11:45.238
Oh yeah, no problem.

11:45.272 --> 11:46.306
I was gonna be there anyway.

11:46.339 --> 11:49.777
I'll be unveiling the
latest in my Melch-Andise.

11:49.810 --> 11:51.845
I'm sorry, Barry, I'm just
not sure that you're qualified

11:51.879 --> 11:54.114
to watch another human being.

11:54.147 --> 11:56.884
And you'd be absolutely
right in feeling that way.

11:56.917 --> 11:57.951
Dad, we'll be fine.

11:57.985 --> 11:58.952
I'm a teenager now.

11:58.986 --> 12:02.155
And that is exactly
what I'm worried about.

12:02.189 --> 12:03.156
Pardon me for interrupting,

12:03.190 --> 12:06.326
but can I volunteer in
helping with all this?

12:06.359 --> 12:08.395
With me helping, Tyler could participate

12:08.428 --> 12:09.596
in the state science fair

12:09.629 --> 12:12.332
and you could have an eventful
time in New York as well.

12:12.365 --> 12:14.267
After all, you programmed me

12:14.301 --> 12:16.937
with 224 different
babysitting techniques

12:16.970 --> 12:19.506
that deal with responsibility, homework,

12:19.539 --> 12:22.342
etiquette, manners, and cleanliness.

12:22.375 --> 12:23.376
Thank you.

12:24.577 --> 12:26.246
What do you think?

12:27.915 --> 12:28.816
Well.

12:28.849 --> 12:29.482
Yes?

12:32.185 --> 12:35.188
I suppose if Robo-Dog
goes with you, it'd be okay.

12:35.222 --> 12:36.356
Yes!

12:36.389 --> 12:38.058
Did I get the job?

12:38.091 --> 12:39.359
Yeah you did.

12:39.392 --> 12:41.228
Okay guys, here's the plan.

12:41.261 --> 12:42.395
After your competition,

12:42.429 --> 12:45.232
you guys will meet me for
the final day of the summit.

12:45.265 --> 12:48.301
You have to have Robo-Dog
there for my speech.

12:48.335 --> 12:49.870
It'll be perfect.

12:49.903 --> 12:50.470
No worries.

12:50.503 --> 12:52.339
Right, Barry?

12:52.372 --> 12:54.207
What could go wrong?

12:58.445 --> 12:59.279
Your mom's gonna kill me.

12:59.312 --> 13:02.282
(defeated music)

13:08.055 --> 13:10.357
(perky music)

13:14.928 --> 13:16.196
Do you have everything, Tyler?

13:16.229 --> 13:18.031
Yeah, I think so.

13:18.065 --> 13:20.033
Your mother wants to know if
you packed enough underwear.

13:20.067 --> 13:21.268
Mom.

13:21.301 --> 13:22.302
Affirmative.

13:22.335 --> 13:24.204
I packed those for him.

13:24.237 --> 13:26.339
Robo-Dog packed the underwear, honey.

13:26.373 --> 13:28.241
I'm telling you, you have
nothing to worry about.

13:28.275 --> 13:31.378
We should stop at a store
so I can get my underwear.

13:31.411 --> 13:32.179
Okay.

13:32.212 --> 13:33.313
Love you too.

13:34.381 --> 13:36.984
Your mom says good luck
and she sends you a kiss.

13:37.017 --> 13:39.286
You guys have a great time at the fair.

13:39.319 --> 13:40.120
[Tyler] You too.

13:40.153 --> 13:41.388
Bye, dad.

13:41.421 --> 13:42.222
Love you.

13:42.255 --> 13:43.356
Love you.

13:43.390 --> 13:44.291
Bye, Barry.

13:47.360 --> 13:49.029
Are you crying?

13:49.062 --> 13:49.997
[Barry] Maybe.

13:50.030 --> 13:51.564
Barry, would you...

13:56.937 --> 13:59.406
All right, you guys have fun.

13:59.439 --> 14:01.074
No flying, Robo-Dog.

14:01.108 --> 14:02.209
Understood.

14:03.210 --> 14:04.544
Please take care of Tyler.

14:04.577 --> 14:05.645
Do not worry, Tom.

14:05.678 --> 14:06.646
I will.

14:06.679 --> 14:07.514
Bye, dad.

14:07.547 --> 14:10.217
Good luck at the summit.

14:10.250 --> 14:11.151
Bye, Tom.

14:15.522 --> 14:17.590
I miss Tom already.

14:17.624 --> 14:18.458
Really?

14:23.530 --> 14:25.532
See you in a few days.

14:27.367 --> 14:28.535
It's so sad.

14:30.637 --> 14:32.205
Are you crying?

14:32.239 --> 14:33.306
Yes.

14:33.340 --> 14:34.341
(Robo-Dog cries)

14:34.374 --> 14:35.008
Why?

14:36.209 --> 14:37.444
Since everyone else is crying,

14:37.477 --> 14:40.347
I thought I was supposed to cry too.

14:40.380 --> 14:42.382
No, we're supposed to be excited,

14:42.415 --> 14:44.051
because we're going on a new adventure,

14:44.084 --> 14:45.652
right, Barry?

14:45.685 --> 14:46.519
Right.

14:47.620 --> 14:51.224
Do you even know where we're
supposed to be driving?

14:51.258 --> 14:54.061
Robo-Dog, directions
to the science fair.

14:54.094 --> 14:55.395
Calculating now.

14:57.164 --> 14:58.665
[GPS Voice] Make an immediate U-turn.

14:58.698 --> 15:00.367
Oh, that's right.

15:00.400 --> 15:03.236
(tires squealing)

15:03.270 --> 15:06.006
(bumbling music)

15:13.213 --> 15:15.282
Went the wrong way.

15:15.315 --> 15:16.216
Bye, dad.

15:19.352 --> 15:20.353
Oh, Barry.

15:22.722 --> 15:26.193
(peaceful piano music)

15:32.332 --> 15:33.967
How's it going?

15:35.735 --> 15:39.406
[Carson] Is it supposed
to look like this?

15:41.308 --> 15:42.375
If you add a little paint,

15:42.409 --> 15:44.644
I'm sure it'll be just fine.

15:44.677 --> 15:45.478
Okay.

15:45.512 --> 15:46.413
Good luck.

15:46.446 --> 15:47.280
Thanks.

15:51.718 --> 15:53.020
Hey, Tyler!

15:54.054 --> 15:56.389
I got us road supplies.

15:56.423 --> 15:58.125
I got us hats

15:58.158 --> 15:59.326
and sunglasses,

15:59.359 --> 16:01.194
and I got us all kinds of snacks.

16:01.228 --> 16:04.131
I got circus peanuts,
honey-roasted peanuts,

16:04.164 --> 16:06.533
boiled peanuts, regular peanuts.

16:06.566 --> 16:07.767
Oh, great.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.302
I'm allergic to peanuts.

16:09.336 --> 16:10.337
[Barry] Oh.

16:10.370 --> 16:11.371
I also got mustard.

16:11.404 --> 16:12.272
This is gonna be great.

16:12.305 --> 16:15.275
(bemused music)

16:22.782 --> 16:24.317
Oh, this is good.

16:24.351 --> 16:25.352
Yep.

16:25.385 --> 16:27.987
(upbeat music)

16:30.090 --> 16:34.094
(Tyler and Barry singing along)

16:35.095 --> 16:36.063
What are you doing?

16:36.096 --> 16:36.996
Singing along.

16:37.030 --> 16:38.265
[Robo-Dog] Should I be doing this too?

16:38.298 --> 16:39.199
Sure.

16:39.232 --> 16:43.303
(Tyler, Barry, Robo-Dog singing along)

16:45.738 --> 16:47.540
Tyler, I like this song.

16:47.574 --> 16:50.410
May I download it for my MP3 player?

16:50.443 --> 16:51.244
Of course.

16:51.278 --> 16:54.281
(upbeat rock music)

16:55.382 --> 16:59.552
(Barry, Tyler, Robo-Dog singing along)

17:02.122 --> 17:03.490
Thank you, Robo-Dog.

17:03.523 --> 17:07.694
(Barry, Tyler, Robo-Dog singing along)

17:18.204 --> 17:19.038
Hello?

17:21.208 --> 17:22.040
Anybody?

17:23.810 --> 17:25.778
Oh hey, how'd it turn out?

17:25.811 --> 17:28.415
I don't know, what do you think?

17:28.448 --> 17:29.616
It looks good.

17:29.649 --> 17:30.450
Yeah?

17:30.483 --> 17:31.284
Yeah.

17:31.318 --> 17:32.319
Who's it for?

17:32.352 --> 17:33.019
My daughter, Mira.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.020
It's her sixth birthday today

17:34.053 --> 17:36.423
and she loves to play
tea party with her toys.

17:36.456 --> 17:37.490
Oh, I love it.

17:37.524 --> 17:39.426
It's a very nice gift.

17:39.459 --> 17:40.093
I hope so.

17:40.127 --> 17:42.329
I never know what she wants.

17:42.362 --> 17:43.330
Love and attention.

17:43.363 --> 17:44.431
That's what all girls want.

17:44.464 --> 17:46.199
I'll remember that.

17:46.233 --> 17:48.201
Of course cupcakes and puppies help too.

17:48.235 --> 17:49.702
What do I owe you?

17:50.637 --> 17:53.173
This is embarrassing.

17:53.206 --> 17:56.109
My computer's not working.

17:56.143 --> 17:57.110
Mind if I take a look?

17:57.144 --> 17:58.044
Oh no, you don't have to.

17:58.077 --> 17:59.779
I've had several people
look at it before

17:59.812 --> 18:01.248
and no one has been able to...

18:01.281 --> 18:01.881
There you go.

18:01.914 --> 18:02.782
[Ceramic Worker] Fix it.

18:02.815 --> 18:03.316
Shouldn't give you anymore troubles.

18:03.350 --> 18:04.384
How'd you do that?

18:04.417 --> 18:07.154
Oh me and computers,
we have an understanding.

18:07.187 --> 18:08.155
Here you go.

18:08.188 --> 18:08.788
Thank you very much.

18:08.821 --> 18:09.822
She's gonna love it.

18:09.856 --> 18:10.857
I hope so.

18:11.924 --> 18:14.594
(hopeful music)

18:19.399 --> 18:20.400
I got it.

18:20.433 --> 18:23.303
(lighthearted music)

18:24.271 --> 18:25.272
Whoa.

18:25.305 --> 18:26.173
Thank you.

18:26.206 --> 18:27.274
No problem.

18:28.675 --> 18:30.610
Is that your science project?

18:30.643 --> 18:32.312
No, it's just my dog.

18:32.345 --> 18:33.112
Thank goodness.

18:33.146 --> 18:34.414
There's no way we would've beaten

18:34.447 --> 18:36.183
something as cool as him.

18:36.216 --> 18:37.417
Never doubt yourself.

18:37.450 --> 18:39.319
Besides, there are plenty of categories.

18:39.352 --> 18:40.320
He's right.

18:40.353 --> 18:42.422
We just need to add some
oomph to that volcano.

18:42.455 --> 18:45.358
What do you say we go inside
and knock their socks off?

18:45.392 --> 18:46.226
Yeah!

18:48.728 --> 18:51.231
Why would they want to
knock anyone's socks off?

18:51.264 --> 18:52.365
It's just a figure of speech.

18:52.399 --> 18:54.167
You don't take it literally.

18:54.201 --> 18:55.168
Oh I have.

18:55.202 --> 18:56.669
When I was working on my
solar-powered toaster,

18:56.703 --> 18:58.905
I hit a live wire and
knocked myself out.

18:58.938 --> 19:01.308
When I woke up, my socks were off,

19:01.341 --> 19:03.376
but my shoes were on.

19:03.410 --> 19:04.477
Strange, huh?

19:05.478 --> 19:07.847
No stranger than any
of your other stories.

19:07.880 --> 19:08.715
Come on.

19:18.691 --> 19:19.692
Mr. Melch.

19:22.329 --> 19:23.162
Mr. Melch.

19:23.863 --> 19:24.764
My dad here?

19:24.797 --> 19:28.335
I believe he is referring to you, Barry.

19:28.368 --> 19:29.369
Oh, that's right.

19:29.402 --> 19:30.303
How might I help you?

19:30.337 --> 19:32.939
Oh my goodness, a talking dog.

19:32.972 --> 19:34.474
How extraordinary!

19:35.475 --> 19:36.576
Is he your project?

19:36.609 --> 19:38.745
No, he's just my dog, sir.

19:38.778 --> 19:43.250
What a lovely addition
to the competition.

19:43.283 --> 19:44.984
Mr. Melch, it's such a
pleasure having you here.

19:45.017 --> 19:46.619
No problem.

19:46.653 --> 19:47.620
The board and I were wondering

19:47.654 --> 19:49.389
if you might say a few
words of encouragement

19:49.422 --> 19:50.290
to the students

19:50.323 --> 19:52.625
to officially kick off the competition?

19:52.659 --> 19:54.761
I love encouraging others with my words.

19:54.794 --> 19:56.629
That would be great.

19:59.999 --> 20:01.668
This I gotta see.

20:01.701 --> 20:02.535
Me too.

20:04.271 --> 20:06.373
Right this way, Mr. Melch.

20:06.406 --> 20:07.707
Good luck, Barry.

20:07.740 --> 20:08.641
Thanks.

20:08.675 --> 20:12.345
Just allow me to make your introduction.

20:16.583 --> 20:17.817
Good evening, everyone.

20:17.850 --> 20:19.419
Good evening,

20:19.452 --> 20:24.324
and welcome to the 17th
annual state science fair.

20:24.357 --> 20:26.559
(applauding)

20:27.494 --> 20:32.265
It is so wonderful to see so
many great projects out there.

20:32.299 --> 20:33.966
This has been our biggest year yet.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.869
(audience applauds and cheers)

20:36.903 --> 20:39.439
Now to kick off the festivities,

20:39.472 --> 20:40.707
it is my pleasure to introduce to you

20:40.740 --> 20:43.009
one of our sponsors,

20:43.042 --> 20:46.713
and the creator of
Melch-Andise Enterprises,

20:48.881 --> 20:50.417
Mr. Barry Melch.

20:51.418 --> 20:54.421
(audience applauds)

20:56.923 --> 20:58.491
Barry.

20:58.525 --> 21:00.026
Barry, that's you.

21:00.893 --> 21:01.694
[Mr. Dean] Mr. Melch.

21:01.728 --> 21:02.995
Oh, oh, yeah.

21:04.464 --> 21:05.064
Mr. Melch.

21:05.097 --> 21:08.000
(audience applauds)

21:08.034 --> 21:09.669
(Barry laughs)

21:09.702 --> 21:12.472
(inspired music)

21:14.374 --> 21:15.375
Good evening.

21:15.408 --> 21:17.410
(microphone screeches)

21:17.444 --> 21:18.978
I can't watch this.

21:23.049 --> 21:26.052
It is truly an honor
to be here with you today

21:26.085 --> 21:29.456
at this wonderful competition.

21:29.489 --> 21:32.425
Seeing all of you here
with your projects

21:32.459 --> 21:34.060
is truly inspiring.

21:35.695 --> 21:39.466
But getting here was not an easy road.

21:39.499 --> 21:42.669
There were several bumps along the way.

21:42.702 --> 21:44.371
But I kept on going.

21:45.505 --> 21:49.709
I finally found a place for
myself in the world of science

21:49.742 --> 21:53.079
so that I could be before you today.

21:53.112 --> 21:55.815
I hope that all of you
continue to be motivated

21:55.848 --> 21:58.651
and inspired in this field,

21:58.685 --> 22:01.354
because you are the future

22:01.388 --> 22:03.556
that I look forward to being a part of.

22:03.590 --> 22:04.256
Thank you.

22:04.290 --> 22:06.926
(audience applauds and cheers)

22:06.959 --> 22:08.528
Tyler, did Barry just say

22:08.561 --> 22:10.430
something moving and inspirational?

22:10.463 --> 22:11.130
Yeah.

22:11.163 --> 22:12.465
I am not sure my processors

22:12.499 --> 22:14.634
are allowing me to compute that.

22:14.667 --> 22:17.770
And now, to officially
kick off the science fair,

22:17.804 --> 22:21.974
we have the largest mint
candy and diet cola display

22:22.942 --> 22:24.444
ever seen indoors.

22:26.178 --> 22:29.148
I might remind you, you're
all in the splash zone.

22:29.181 --> 22:31.050
(audience laughs)

22:31.083 --> 22:33.653
(Barry laughs)

22:35.622 --> 22:38.791
Mr. Melch, would you do us the
honors of pulling the string?

22:38.825 --> 22:40.427
I'd be glad to.

22:42.762 --> 22:45.565
And now, on the count of three.

22:45.598 --> 22:46.699
One,

22:46.733 --> 22:47.800
two,

22:47.834 --> 22:48.501
three!

22:48.535 --> 22:52.605
(audience applauds and cheers)

22:53.940 --> 22:54.741
(bottle explodes)
(everyone gasps)

22:54.774 --> 22:56.476
(Mr. Dean laughs)

22:56.509 --> 23:00.680
(bottles exploding)
(crowd gasping)

23:02.515 --> 23:04.150
(glass shattering)

23:04.183 --> 23:06.185
(crowd screaming)

23:06.218 --> 23:09.522
Sure that's not supposed to happen.

23:12.091 --> 23:15.094
Barry, help me evacuate these people!

23:15.127 --> 23:17.430
This all looks very familiar.

23:17.464 --> 23:18.465
Barry!

23:18.498 --> 23:19.932
Oh, yeah,

23:19.966 --> 23:20.800
got it!

23:22.168 --> 23:24.637
Everyone remain calm.

23:24.671 --> 23:27.707
Please be safe and slow down.

23:27.740 --> 23:29.008
Do not panic.

23:29.041 --> 23:30.710
Please stop running.

23:32.211 --> 23:33.012
I said stop!

23:35.982 --> 23:38.451
Okay, follow me in an orderly fashion

23:38.485 --> 23:41.020
and I will get you to the nearest exit.

23:41.053 --> 23:43.556
[Barry] This way, everybody!

23:46.526 --> 23:47.627
Tyler, get them out of here.

23:47.660 --> 23:48.461
I'll take care of the gas

23:48.495 --> 23:50.497
and make sure to extinguish the fire.

23:50.530 --> 23:51.130
(Tyler coughs)

23:51.163 --> 23:51.964
Thanks, Robo-Dog.

23:51.998 --> 23:52.799
We'll see you out there.

23:52.832 --> 23:54.200
Come on, guys, let's go, let's go!

23:54.233 --> 23:57.036
(urgent music)

24:06.746 --> 24:07.580
Uh-oh.

24:08.848 --> 24:11.250
(exploding)

24:11.283 --> 24:13.452
(beeping)

24:17.256 --> 24:18.891
Hi, mom, I just finished a job.

24:18.925 --> 24:21.127
I'm on my way home now.

24:21.160 --> 24:24.096
Are you having a good time with Mira?

24:24.130 --> 24:25.532
Good.

24:25.565 --> 24:28.167
Yes, I got her a birthday present,

24:28.200 --> 24:30.136
a good one this time.

24:32.104 --> 24:33.606
Mom, she's gonna love it.

24:33.640 --> 24:34.473
Yeah.

24:35.241 --> 24:36.475
She will.

24:37.276 --> 24:38.778
I'll see you soon.

24:38.811 --> 24:40.112
I love you too, bye.

24:40.146 --> 24:43.215
(lighthearted music)

24:45.618 --> 24:47.186
She's gonna love it.

24:47.219 --> 24:50.523
[Robo-Dog] Must find assistance.

24:50.557 --> 24:52.525
(Carson shouts)
(tires squealing)

24:52.559 --> 24:54.827
(thudding)

24:56.295 --> 24:57.830
What was that?

25:01.000 --> 25:01.834
Oh no.

25:06.238 --> 25:07.273
Hey little guy.

25:08.575 --> 25:09.676
Are you okay?

25:11.778 --> 25:12.612
Help me.

25:13.580 --> 25:14.213
Oh.

25:15.347 --> 25:17.316
Was that you talking?

25:17.349 --> 25:18.585
Affirmative.

25:18.618 --> 25:20.086
Please assist.

25:20.119 --> 25:20.953
Wow.

25:22.088 --> 25:25.792
You're a little furry,
walking, talking computer, huh?

25:25.825 --> 25:27.660
Warning, memory card damaged,

25:27.694 --> 25:30.797
internal systems overheating.

25:30.830 --> 25:33.265
All right, let's see if
we can find your owner.

25:33.299 --> 25:34.233
I bet they can help.

25:34.266 --> 25:35.134
No time.

25:35.167 --> 25:37.136
Need repairs now.

25:37.169 --> 25:38.537
Yeah you do.

25:39.171 --> 25:40.072
I think I could get you fixed up.

25:40.106 --> 25:42.141
I got everything I
need back at my place.

25:42.174 --> 25:44.143
Is it okay if I take you there?

25:44.176 --> 25:45.678
Affirmative.

25:45.712 --> 25:47.046
Please assist.

25:47.079 --> 25:48.715
All right, let's get you fixed up.

25:48.748 --> 25:51.217
(ominous music)

26:03.195 --> 26:05.231
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm
so glad that everyone's okay,

26:05.264 --> 26:08.234
but unfortunately,
we are going to have to

26:08.267 --> 26:11.604
delay the science fair for a day or two.

26:16.643 --> 26:19.045
Barry, have you seen Robo-Dog?

26:19.078 --> 26:21.080
I thought you had him.

26:27.887 --> 26:31.123
All right, folks, there's
actually something to see here.

26:31.157 --> 26:33.660
It's really quiet interesting.

26:34.827 --> 26:35.795
(Tyler coughs)

26:35.828 --> 26:37.196
Robo-Dog!

26:37.229 --> 26:38.765
Robo-Dog, where are you?

26:38.798 --> 26:39.699
Kid, you can't be in here.

26:39.732 --> 26:40.633
- You're not safe.
- No!

26:40.667 --> 26:41.934
No no no!

26:41.968 --> 26:42.601
Robo-Dog!

26:45.271 --> 26:46.072
Can't have you in there, kid.

26:46.105 --> 26:46.806
It's not safe.

26:46.839 --> 26:48.975
I know that my dog is in there.

26:49.008 --> 26:49.776
I know it!

26:49.809 --> 26:50.777
We didn't find any dogs in there.

26:50.810 --> 26:53.746
I'm sure he went out a
back door or something.

26:53.780 --> 26:55.748
Look, kid, dogs are smart.

26:55.782 --> 26:57.817
They know how to get out
of a burning building.

26:57.850 --> 26:59.251
I'm sure he's fine.

27:01.788 --> 27:04.123
Barry, are you sure that he's safe?

27:04.156 --> 27:05.091
He'll be fine.

27:05.124 --> 27:07.193
Couldn't have gone too far.

27:15.902 --> 27:18.070
Okay, little guy,

27:18.104 --> 27:20.873
just gonna sit you down for a sec,

27:20.907 --> 27:24.310
and I will get you all
fixed up, all right?

27:26.245 --> 27:27.079
Robo-Dog.

27:28.781 --> 27:30.216
That makes sense.

27:32.251 --> 27:34.821
We'll get you hooked up to my computer

27:34.854 --> 27:37.189
and we will run some
diagnostic tests on you.

27:37.223 --> 27:39.258
You will be just fine.

27:41.327 --> 27:44.063
Oh, is there way to open you up?

27:44.096 --> 27:45.264
Affirmative.

27:47.366 --> 27:51.203
(laughs)
That's impressive.

27:55.407 --> 27:57.276
Structurally, you look good.

27:57.309 --> 27:59.912
Power source, oh, impressive.

28:02.148 --> 28:05.718
Your CPU, no damage,
main board looks good.

28:06.518 --> 28:08.354
That's what's important.

28:08.387 --> 28:09.922
Coolant.

28:09.956 --> 28:12.759
You, my friend, are running a bit low.

28:12.792 --> 28:15.261
(bemused music)

28:17.363 --> 28:18.297
All righty.

28:20.266 --> 28:21.300
Uh-huh.

28:22.401 --> 28:23.235
Ah.

28:27.439 --> 28:28.274
Okay,

28:28.307 --> 28:31.410
Okay, I'm trying, let me unplug it.

28:35.181 --> 28:36.315
No.

28:36.348 --> 28:37.249
No.

28:37.283 --> 28:38.317
No!

28:40.186 --> 28:41.921
Really almost got me.

28:44.190 --> 28:45.357
Thanks so much.

28:45.391 --> 28:46.793
I'm sorry.

28:46.826 --> 28:50.029
Okay, let's see how we're doing.

28:50.062 --> 28:52.965
Coolant level is now fine.

28:52.999 --> 28:57.036
But, wow, your memory board
seems to be a bit damaged.

28:57.069 --> 29:00.072
Not to worry, I've got one of those.

29:04.276 --> 29:05.211
Right here.

29:08.314 --> 29:12.184
Oh, looks like this is little singed.

29:12.218 --> 29:14.353
New memory board.

29:14.386 --> 29:16.288
Put this guy in.

29:16.322 --> 29:18.324
No memory card detected.

29:20.292 --> 29:23.162
Looks like you don't even have one.

29:23.195 --> 29:25.231
Also, not to worry,

29:25.264 --> 29:27.399
got a flash card right here.

29:28.868 --> 29:30.369
Stick this guy in.

29:34.273 --> 29:35.808
Okay.

29:35.842 --> 29:37.276
Excellent.

29:37.309 --> 29:39.045
You, my friend, are looking good.

29:39.078 --> 29:40.980
Once you're rebooted,
we will find your owner,

29:41.013 --> 29:42.381
we'll get you home.

29:43.415 --> 29:46.052
Speaking of home, there's my daughter.

29:46.085 --> 29:47.219
Stay right there, okay?

29:47.253 --> 29:49.856
(gentle music)

29:54.961 --> 29:56.262
Hey, how's my birthday girl?

29:56.295 --> 29:58.297
(Mira laughs)

29:58.330 --> 29:59.565
[Mira] Look at my balloon.

29:59.598 --> 30:01.500
Wow, look at that.

30:01.533 --> 30:02.468
Very nice.

30:02.501 --> 30:03.402
Hi, mom.

30:03.435 --> 30:05.204
Come on, get up and help your mother.

30:05.237 --> 30:06.939
Oh, I'm sorry.

30:06.973 --> 30:07.773
Sorry.

30:07.806 --> 30:09.876
Thank you for looking after Mira.

30:09.909 --> 30:10.977
[Cynthia] I love taking care of you.

30:11.010 --> 30:11.610
Look what we got.

30:11.643 --> 30:12.444
We got cake.

30:12.478 --> 30:13.545
Look what we have.

30:13.579 --> 30:14.981
I got presents.

30:15.014 --> 30:16.348
I got decorations.

30:16.382 --> 30:18.250
You did get a present?

30:18.284 --> 30:20.519
Of course I got a present.

30:20.552 --> 30:23.389
Nana got me a new tea set.

30:23.422 --> 30:27.393
Oh, look at that,
grandma got you a tea set

30:28.327 --> 30:29.828
with a teapot too?

30:31.063 --> 30:32.231
Yes.

30:32.264 --> 30:34.000
Look how fancy it is.

30:34.033 --> 30:37.136
(laughs)
Yeah, it's really fancy.

30:37.169 --> 30:37.970
It's great.

30:38.004 --> 30:41.073
(lighthearted music)

30:45.077 --> 30:46.512
(clattering)

30:46.545 --> 30:48.547
What was that?

30:48.580 --> 30:50.249
What was what?

30:50.282 --> 30:51.217
Who wants cake?

30:51.250 --> 30:52.318
Oh, oh, me!

30:54.020 --> 30:57.189
Not until after your present.

30:57.223 --> 30:58.857
You're gonna just...

31:02.929 --> 31:05.331
Is that my present?

31:05.364 --> 31:06.365
[Carson] Yep.

31:06.398 --> 31:07.233
A dog?

31:08.234 --> 31:09.435
A dog?

31:09.468 --> 31:10.302
A dog.

31:12.304 --> 31:13.572
Hi, I'm Mira.

31:15.074 --> 31:16.475
Hello, Mira.

31:16.508 --> 31:18.044
A talking dog?

31:18.710 --> 31:20.379
It's a talking dog.

31:20.412 --> 31:21.213
It's not a real dog.

31:21.247 --> 31:22.414
It's a robot.

31:22.448 --> 31:23.682
What's your name?

31:23.715 --> 31:26.352
I do not believe I have a name.

31:26.385 --> 31:29.121
Daddy, what's his name?

31:29.155 --> 31:30.556
I don't know.

31:30.589 --> 31:32.224
Hmm, what about...

31:34.126 --> 31:35.027
...Mr. Sparky?

31:36.628 --> 31:38.464
Why Mr. Sparky?

31:38.497 --> 31:39.331
Why not?

31:40.666 --> 31:42.268
Okay, Mr. Sparky.

31:43.502 --> 31:44.303
Hear that?

31:44.336 --> 31:46.338
Your name's Mr. Sparky.

31:46.372 --> 31:48.607
My name is Mr. Sparky.

31:48.640 --> 31:50.642
We're going to be best friends.

31:50.676 --> 31:53.212
[Mr. Sparky] We are going
to be best friends.

31:53.245 --> 31:54.146
[Mira] Thank you, Daddy.

31:54.180 --> 31:55.314
I love you so much!

31:55.347 --> 31:58.084
It's the best present ever!

31:58.117 --> 31:59.318
Listen, Mira...

32:01.120 --> 32:02.688
Don't start getting weird on her.

32:02.721 --> 32:04.556
You did good.

32:04.590 --> 32:05.591
She's happy.

32:07.193 --> 32:08.294
She is.

32:08.327 --> 32:10.296
She is happy, isn't she?

32:10.329 --> 32:12.231
You did good!

32:12.264 --> 32:13.932
I'm so proud of you.

32:15.067 --> 32:16.235
Thanks, mom.

32:17.103 --> 32:18.204
Who wants cake?

32:18.237 --> 32:19.238
Yay, cake!

32:20.406 --> 32:21.407
Yay, cake.

32:25.577 --> 32:27.679
Man, where could he be?

32:27.713 --> 32:29.348
Seems like we looked everywhere.

32:29.381 --> 32:32.184
(phone vibrates)

32:32.218 --> 32:34.186
Aw man, it's my dad.

32:34.220 --> 32:35.121
Oh, Tom?

32:35.154 --> 32:37.056
Tell him I said hi.

32:37.089 --> 32:38.024
[Tyler] Hey, dad.

32:38.057 --> 32:39.158
Hey, buddy.

32:39.791 --> 32:40.559
Everything good?

32:40.592 --> 32:43.029
This place is so awesome, Tyler.

32:43.062 --> 32:45.097
I can't wait for you to get down here.

32:45.131 --> 32:46.398
How's Robo-Dog?

32:46.432 --> 32:48.300
Oh, he's doing good.

32:48.334 --> 32:50.769
[Tom] Can I talk to him?

32:50.802 --> 32:52.304
He wants to talk to Robo-Dog.

32:52.338 --> 32:53.672
I'll handle it.

32:53.705 --> 32:55.341
Give me the phone.

32:55.374 --> 32:56.708
Hi, Tom.

32:56.742 --> 32:57.743
Hi, Barry.

32:59.078 --> 33:00.246
How's everything going?

33:00.279 --> 33:01.313
We lost Robo-Dog.

33:01.347 --> 33:02.414
What?

33:02.448 --> 33:04.250
What?

33:04.283 --> 33:06.385
No, I was just kidding.

33:06.418 --> 33:07.753
He's right here.

33:08.720 --> 33:11.057
Can I speak with him, please?

33:11.090 --> 33:12.324
Sure.

33:12.358 --> 33:14.693
But if we had lost
him, what would you do?

33:14.726 --> 33:16.228
I suppose I would check his tablet

33:16.262 --> 33:18.330
and track him down, Barry.

33:18.364 --> 33:22.401
Ah, you'd use the tablet to
track him, of course. (Laughs)

33:22.434 --> 33:23.502
Barry.

33:23.535 --> 33:25.271
You're starting to make me nervous.

33:25.304 --> 33:27.606
Can I speak with Robo-Dog please?

33:27.639 --> 33:28.740
Sure.

33:28.774 --> 33:30.209
He wants to talk to Robo-Dog.

33:30.242 --> 33:31.277
What am I supposed to do?

33:31.310 --> 33:33.312
Sound more robotic and dog-like.

33:33.345 --> 33:34.146
[Tyler] What?

33:34.180 --> 33:35.681
Here he is.

33:35.714 --> 33:36.782
Hello, Tom.

33:38.117 --> 33:39.551
Robo-Dog.

33:39.585 --> 33:41.087
Are you all right?

33:41.120 --> 33:42.288
Everything is fine.

33:42.321 --> 33:43.822
Thank you for asking.

33:43.855 --> 33:45.324
Are you sure?

33:45.357 --> 33:47.826
You sound a little odd.

33:47.859 --> 33:51.263
I am still recovering
from my crash landing,

33:51.297 --> 33:53.632
but I am sure I will be just fine.

33:53.665 --> 33:54.600
Okay.

33:54.633 --> 33:56.568
Put Tyler back on the phone.

33:56.602 --> 33:58.337
Affirmative, dad,

33:58.370 --> 33:59.371
I mean, Tom.

34:01.873 --> 34:03.075
Hey dad.

34:03.109 --> 34:04.743
Tyler, it sounds like Robo-Dog

34:04.776 --> 34:07.413
is experiencing some issues.

34:07.446 --> 34:09.281
Oh yeah, no, he's doing just fine.

34:09.315 --> 34:10.782
Just a little confused at times.

34:10.815 --> 34:11.650
Okay.

34:12.650 --> 34:15.554
I'll check him out when
you guys get out here.

34:15.587 --> 34:17.356
I'm excited for you to come, Tyler.

34:17.389 --> 34:18.489
All right, see you, dad.

34:18.524 --> 34:20.292
[Tom] Bye.

34:20.326 --> 34:21.327
Man, that was close.

34:21.360 --> 34:23.262
Hey, we can use that
tablet to track Robo-Dog.

34:23.295 --> 34:24.396
Let's go.

34:24.429 --> 34:25.297
No problem.

34:25.331 --> 34:26.331
Let me finish my milkshake.

34:26.364 --> 34:30.335
(slurping)
(bumbling music)

34:49.554 --> 34:50.489
All right, Barry, come on, let's go.

34:50.522 --> 34:51.690
(slurping)

34:51.723 --> 34:52.724
Ah, come on!

34:55.927 --> 34:58.764
(contented music)

35:00.832 --> 35:02.401
Oh.

35:02.434 --> 35:04.336
Good, she's asleep.

35:04.370 --> 35:05.337
Affirmative.

35:06.772 --> 35:09.241
Did you have a good time at the party?

35:09.275 --> 35:12.244
I am sorry, but I do not know your name.

35:12.278 --> 35:14.780
Oh, I'm, yeah, Carson Perry.

35:16.815 --> 35:19.851
Nice to meet you, Carson Perry.

35:19.885 --> 35:22.254
You're an amazing thing.

35:25.824 --> 35:27.459
Please clarify.

35:29.861 --> 35:31.763
You make Mira smile,

35:31.797 --> 35:34.433
and that's really incredible.

35:35.467 --> 35:36.502
Thank you.

35:36.535 --> 35:39.571
Oh, it has been my pleasure.

35:39.605 --> 35:41.640
(beeping)

35:41.673 --> 35:43.242
What is that sound?

35:43.275 --> 35:45.344
I believe it is me.

35:45.377 --> 35:46.645
What does it mean?

35:46.678 --> 35:47.846
[Mr. Sparky] I am not sure.

35:47.879 --> 35:50.316
Here, let me take a look.

35:51.850 --> 35:53.919
Okay, we're really close to him.

35:53.952 --> 35:56.888
We just need to take
this left right up here.

35:56.922 --> 35:57.723
Let's take a look.

35:57.756 --> 35:59.925
(beeping)

36:02.328 --> 36:03.395
There you go.

36:04.796 --> 36:06.398
Let's get her to bed.

36:06.432 --> 36:07.733
What?

36:07.766 --> 36:10.336
No, no no no no, what happened?

36:12.371 --> 36:14.206
Deactivated?

36:14.240 --> 36:15.374
Why?

36:15.407 --> 36:18.577
Looks like someone doesn't
want Robo-Dog to be found.

36:18.610 --> 36:20.346
You mean?

36:20.379 --> 36:23.515
Maybe Robo-Dog's been Robo-Dog-napped.

36:24.416 --> 36:27.286
(worried music)

36:31.457 --> 36:34.426
(peaceful music)

36:48.907 --> 36:52.378
Thank you, Daddy, for
bringing me a best friend.

36:52.411 --> 36:53.679
You're welcome.

36:53.712 --> 36:55.247
Good night.

36:55.281 --> 36:57.616
Say good night to Mr. Sparky.

36:57.649 --> 36:58.484
Okay.

37:00.018 --> 37:00.952
Good night.

37:01.887 --> 37:04.323
Good night, Carson Perry.

37:05.056 --> 37:05.891
Go to sleep.

37:05.924 --> 37:08.694
(peaceful music)

37:18.537 --> 37:20.472
Oh, wow, what a mess.

37:28.747 --> 37:29.748
What's this?

37:36.488 --> 37:38.290
[Tyler] My name is Tyler Austin,

37:38.324 --> 37:42.661
and this is my best friend
in the whole world, Robo-Dog.

37:42.694 --> 37:43.595
Uh-oh.

37:43.629 --> 37:44.596
[Tyler] Robo-Dog is the best,

37:44.630 --> 37:49.335
and I can't imagine ever
being apart from him.

37:49.368 --> 37:50.402
Oh boy.

37:53.071 --> 37:54.906
This is not very good.

38:00.111 --> 38:02.381
This was the last place Robo-Dog's

38:02.414 --> 38:03.915
before it was deactivated.

38:03.949 --> 38:06.352
He's gotta be in one of these houses.

38:06.385 --> 38:07.619
We'll find him.

38:07.653 --> 38:08.687
But how?

38:08.720 --> 38:10.088
One word, steak.

38:10.121 --> 38:11.089
Stakeout!

38:11.122 --> 38:13.359
Oh, Barry, you're a genius!

38:13.392 --> 38:14.826
I was just gonna say steak,

38:14.860 --> 38:16.528
but stakeout sounds good.

38:16.562 --> 38:17.829
Sound.

38:17.863 --> 38:19.465
Oh, Barry, that's it!

38:19.498 --> 38:21.833
We can use my sound
tracking device to find him.

38:21.867 --> 38:22.701
Once we input his voice,

38:22.734 --> 38:24.636
it'll help us pinpoint his location.

38:24.670 --> 38:26.805
All right, sounds good, let's do it.

38:26.838 --> 38:29.508
[Robotic Voice] I am Robo-Dog.

38:33.044 --> 38:35.781
(device beeping)

38:37.115 --> 38:37.949
Nothing.

38:39.418 --> 38:40.919
Maybe he's asleep.

38:40.952 --> 38:41.787
Maybe.

38:46.057 --> 38:48.093
Tell you what, let
me take the first shift

38:48.126 --> 38:50.596
so you can get some sleep.

38:50.629 --> 38:51.897
Thanks, Barry.

38:51.930 --> 38:53.031
No problem.

38:58.704 --> 39:01.106
Don't worry, I'll stay awake.

39:11.450 --> 39:12.017
[Tyler] Hey, Barry.

39:12.050 --> 39:12.851
Yeah?

39:12.884 --> 39:13.685
Yep?

39:13.719 --> 39:14.620
[Tyler] Just checking, but yeah,

39:14.653 --> 39:16.087
you do know how to
use that thing, right?

39:16.121 --> 39:17.789
Oh yeah, no problem.

39:17.823 --> 39:19.090
I got it.

39:19.124 --> 39:19.925
[Tyler] Okay.

39:19.958 --> 39:20.759
Goodnight.

39:20.792 --> 39:21.793
Goodnight.

39:23.194 --> 39:26.064
(Barry snoring)

39:33.439 --> 39:35.907
Oh Theodora, you are so funny.

39:35.941 --> 39:37.709
Mira, wasn't I just telling
you just the other day

39:37.743 --> 39:39.411
just how funny she was?

39:39.445 --> 39:41.547
You sure were.

39:41.580 --> 39:42.881
Oh, Mira, my dear,

39:42.914 --> 39:45.116
would you mind pouring
me another spot of tea?

39:45.150 --> 39:46.151
Of course.

39:48.587 --> 39:50.121
Such a lovely flavor.

39:50.155 --> 39:52.458
Where on earth did you find it?

39:52.491 --> 39:54.660
I grew it in my magical garden.

39:54.693 --> 39:56.728
Well it is indeed a magical flavor,

39:56.762 --> 39:59.798
with a hint of lavender.
(Laughs)

39:59.831 --> 40:02.067
Would you like some too, Frogerina?

40:02.100 --> 40:03.735
What about a peach scone?

40:03.769 --> 40:06.805
I know they're your favorite.

40:06.838 --> 40:09.007
You two having fun?

40:09.040 --> 40:10.442
Why, yes, Carson Perry.

40:10.476 --> 40:11.910
It is rather delightful.

40:11.943 --> 40:15.113
Would you care for some
peach and cranberry scones?

40:15.146 --> 40:17.716
Oh, no no no, I'm okay.

40:17.749 --> 40:19.485
I made them myself.

40:21.587 --> 40:23.855
Okay, just one, just one.

40:26.592 --> 40:28.994
Oh, they all look so good.

40:29.027 --> 40:31.096
I'll take this one, okay?

40:31.129 --> 40:33.865
Mm, they are just so sconey good.

40:36.201 --> 40:38.236
Would you like to join us?

40:38.269 --> 40:39.204
No no no no no.

40:39.237 --> 40:41.172
Besides, sweetheart,
you have to get ready,

40:41.206 --> 40:42.874
because we're going to grandma's.

40:42.908 --> 40:43.709
Come on.

40:43.742 --> 40:44.543
Again?

40:44.576 --> 40:45.210
Why?

40:46.678 --> 40:47.646
You love grandma.

40:47.679 --> 40:50.816
Yeah, but I like it
better here with you.

40:50.849 --> 40:52.951
Aw, thanks, sweetheart,

40:52.984 --> 40:55.521
but I gotta go to work.

40:55.554 --> 40:58.223
Is Mr. Sparky gonna go?

40:58.256 --> 40:59.157
Not today.

40:59.190 --> 41:01.527
I thought maybe he would just stay home.

41:01.560 --> 41:02.761
[Mira] Why?

41:02.794 --> 41:03.862
Yes, why?

41:03.895 --> 41:05.531
Mira is my best friend.

41:05.564 --> 41:07.065
I should go with her too.

41:07.098 --> 41:07.899
Please.

41:07.933 --> 41:09.234
Please?

41:09.267 --> 41:10.235
Please please?

41:11.537 --> 41:12.904
Please?

41:12.938 --> 41:13.739
Okay.

41:13.772 --> 41:16.007
Robo-Dog can come too.

41:16.041 --> 41:16.942
Robo-Dog?

41:16.975 --> 41:18.877
You mean Mr. Sparky.

41:18.910 --> 41:19.745
Right.

41:20.812 --> 41:21.713
What did I say?

41:21.747 --> 41:24.015
Yeah, of course, Mr.
Sparky can come too,

41:24.049 --> 41:25.717
but let's go.

41:25.751 --> 41:26.585
Hooray!

41:27.252 --> 41:28.887
Yay!

41:28.920 --> 41:29.755
Yay.

41:35.326 --> 41:38.063
All right, let's get
you two to grandma's.

41:38.096 --> 41:39.531
Yay, grandma's!

41:40.265 --> 41:42.167
Yay, grandma's!

41:42.200 --> 41:44.570
Yay, grandma's.

41:44.603 --> 41:48.774
(device beeping)
(bumbling music)

42:04.289 --> 42:07.125
Barry, why didn't you
wake me up for my shift?

42:07.158 --> 42:07.926
You were so sound asleep

42:07.959 --> 42:09.961
I decided to take the whole night.

42:09.995 --> 42:11.262
Did you see anything?

42:11.296 --> 42:12.063
When?

42:12.097 --> 42:13.264
The whole time you were watching.

42:13.298 --> 42:14.299
Me?

42:14.332 --> 42:15.133
No.

42:15.166 --> 42:16.167
No, nothing.

42:17.268 --> 42:18.236
Man.

42:18.269 --> 42:19.905
Maybe this is the wrong place.

42:19.938 --> 42:23.575
I would've sworn this is where
the beacon is transmitting.

42:23.609 --> 42:24.643
Wanna get breakfast?

42:24.676 --> 42:27.212
Sure, but we have to get
right back to watching.

42:27.245 --> 42:28.313
You got it.

42:33.619 --> 42:35.854
Maybe we should shower too.

42:37.823 --> 42:39.290
Yeah, sounds good.

42:40.992 --> 42:44.229
Man, I just hope we
didn't miss anything.

42:49.334 --> 42:50.235
(Mira laughs)

42:50.268 --> 42:51.269
(Carson shouts)

42:51.302 --> 42:52.170
Hey, come on in.

42:52.203 --> 42:55.774
Get over here and give grandma a kiss.

42:57.208 --> 42:59.044
What, I don't get a kiss?

42:59.077 --> 43:01.146
You're such a baby.

43:01.179 --> 43:02.247
Thanks for looking after Mira.

43:02.280 --> 43:03.682
I love to.

43:03.715 --> 43:06.117
Do I get a kiss too?

43:06.151 --> 43:07.919
No, you don't get a kiss.

43:07.953 --> 43:10.388
Hey, get away from that cake!

43:10.421 --> 43:11.256
I gotta go to work.

43:11.289 --> 43:12.891
I love you.

43:12.924 --> 43:14.092
You're not staying for lunch?

43:14.125 --> 43:14.926
I gotta go.

43:14.960 --> 43:15.794
I got work stuff.

43:15.827 --> 43:16.461
I love you.

43:16.494 --> 43:17.362
I'll be back in a few hours.

43:17.395 --> 43:17.996
[Mira] Bye, Daddy!

43:18.029 --> 43:19.765
Listen to your Grandma!

43:19.798 --> 43:20.398
[Mira] Love you!

43:20.431 --> 43:21.232
[Carson] Love you.

43:21.266 --> 43:22.233
Be a good girl.

43:22.267 --> 43:23.068
[Mira] Bye!

43:23.101 --> 43:23.902
[Carson] Bye.

43:23.935 --> 43:25.837
Your father.

43:25.871 --> 43:28.907
His mind's always someplace else.

43:28.940 --> 43:30.208
You know?

43:30.241 --> 43:31.076
I know.

43:32.210 --> 43:33.979
Are you hungry?

43:34.012 --> 43:35.080
Yes.

43:35.113 --> 43:36.915
Because I made my special.

43:36.948 --> 43:37.783
Yummy!

43:38.850 --> 43:42.153
After this, I'm gonna show
you to my secret place.

43:42.187 --> 43:43.722
Sounds good.

43:43.755 --> 43:46.925
(energetic pop music)

43:55.366 --> 43:57.135
All right, Barry, bathroom's all yours.

43:57.168 --> 44:00.305
Oh, man, Barry, what are you doing?

44:00.338 --> 44:01.372
Sorry.

44:02.340 --> 44:04.142
Sleeping in the car
really cramped me up,

44:04.175 --> 44:06.044
so gotta do my stretches.

44:06.077 --> 44:07.378
Wait,

44:07.412 --> 44:10.048
did you just say sleep?

44:10.081 --> 44:11.149
I may have.

44:12.784 --> 44:14.820
Barry, did you sleep all night?

44:14.853 --> 44:15.687
I'm sorry, Tyler.

44:15.721 --> 44:17.956
I tried to stay awake but I couldn't.

44:17.989 --> 44:20.125
That means Robo-Dog may be in the area

44:20.158 --> 44:21.392
where we thought he was.

44:21.426 --> 44:23.028
Yep, probably.

44:23.061 --> 44:25.263
Then we gotta go back.

44:25.296 --> 44:26.097
You got it,

44:26.131 --> 44:28.800
soon as I'm done with my stretching.

44:28.834 --> 44:30.101
(Barry farts)

44:30.135 --> 44:30.936
Oops.

44:30.969 --> 44:32.237
Oh, gross, Barry!

44:32.270 --> 44:34.105
That was Robo-Dog.

44:34.139 --> 44:36.441
Robo-Dog isn't here.

44:36.474 --> 44:37.809
It may have been me.

44:37.843 --> 44:38.777
Just hurry up, please.

44:38.810 --> 44:41.046
Time is running out.

44:41.079 --> 44:43.248
(Barry farts)

44:43.281 --> 44:46.084
(pretty music)

44:47.919 --> 44:50.288
Where are you taking me?

44:50.321 --> 44:52.257
To this secret place I found.

44:52.290 --> 44:54.159
Nobody knows about it.

44:54.192 --> 44:56.394
I pretend it's my royal kingdom

44:56.427 --> 44:59.130
and rule over all my royal subjects

44:59.164 --> 45:01.867
with a kind and giving heart.

45:01.900 --> 45:04.135
Sounds like a nice place.

45:04.169 --> 45:05.336
There it is.

45:06.404 --> 45:07.839
Race you there.

45:09.307 --> 45:10.809
Oh no you don't.

45:12.277 --> 45:14.880
(lovely music)

45:16.214 --> 45:18.483
Wow, how did you do that?

45:18.516 --> 45:20.185
I don't know.

45:20.218 --> 45:22.053
Do you know any other tricks?

45:22.087 --> 45:22.888
Maybe.

45:22.921 --> 45:23.755
Let's see.

45:26.524 --> 45:28.794
Wow, that's neat!

45:28.827 --> 45:29.427
It is.

45:29.460 --> 45:30.996
Anything else?

45:32.463 --> 45:34.199
(upbeat rock music)

45:34.232 --> 45:35.166
Cool!

45:35.200 --> 45:37.368
Would you like to show me your kingdom?

45:37.402 --> 45:39.337
I'd be glad to.

45:39.370 --> 45:41.940
(lovely music)

45:55.153 --> 45:56.354
Here we are.

45:56.387 --> 45:58.156
It's very nice.

45:58.189 --> 46:01.192
These are where my loyal subjects live.

46:01.226 --> 46:04.029
This is the throne room.

46:04.062 --> 46:05.997
And here's the ballroom!

46:06.031 --> 46:08.233
You have a room shaped like a ball?

46:08.266 --> 46:12.203
No, a ballroom is where
you throw a royal ball.

46:12.237 --> 46:14.172
When you throw these royal balls,

46:14.205 --> 46:15.941
who fetches them?

46:15.974 --> 46:19.244
A ball's another word
for a big dance party.

46:19.277 --> 46:20.879
Oh.

46:20.912 --> 46:23.114
I am not sure I know how to dance.

46:23.148 --> 46:23.982
Well you're a dog.

46:24.015 --> 46:26.484
Dogs aren't really known for dancing.

46:26.517 --> 46:28.286
I'd like to know how.

46:28.319 --> 46:29.821
Could you teach me?

46:29.855 --> 46:30.455
Sure.

46:30.488 --> 46:32.257
First you stand like this.

46:32.290 --> 46:34.125
Then you do this.

46:34.159 --> 46:35.360
Now we need music.

46:35.393 --> 46:36.962
Like this?

46:36.995 --> 46:39.397
(heavy metal music)

46:39.430 --> 46:40.331
No!

46:40.365 --> 46:42.868
Less loud and more classy.

46:42.901 --> 46:44.069
Oh, like this?

46:44.102 --> 46:45.270
(gentle classical music)

46:45.303 --> 46:47.338
Yes, and here we go.

46:49.307 --> 46:53.178
One two three, one two
three, one two three.

46:53.211 --> 46:55.480
One two three, one two three.

46:55.513 --> 46:59.117
(lovely classical music)

47:01.186 --> 47:02.320
Like this?

47:02.353 --> 47:04.589
One two three, one two three.

47:05.656 --> 47:09.194
(Mira laughs)
One two three, one two three.

47:09.227 --> 47:10.261
Like that?

47:11.296 --> 47:12.463
No, silly.

47:12.497 --> 47:14.966
Hold my hand and I'll help you.

47:15.000 --> 47:18.336
One two three, one two
three, one two three.

47:18.369 --> 47:22.007
(lovely classical music)

47:24.042 --> 47:25.243
Spin me!

47:25.276 --> 47:26.111
Okay.

47:30.281 --> 47:31.983
Whoa, I'm dizzy.

47:33.284 --> 47:34.485
Did I do something wrong?

47:34.519 --> 47:37.622
No, just a little
less spinning next time.

47:37.655 --> 47:40.058
Yes, I can do that.

47:40.091 --> 47:43.061
Now I curtsy and you bow.

47:43.094 --> 47:44.095
Like this?

47:46.464 --> 47:47.999
That was nice.

47:48.033 --> 47:49.267
Thank you for teaching me.

47:49.300 --> 47:50.201
You're welcome.

47:50.235 --> 47:51.369
I love to dance.

47:51.402 --> 47:53.038
I do too.

47:53.071 --> 47:54.272
Again?

47:54.305 --> 47:55.373
It's getting late.

47:55.406 --> 47:56.474
We should go.

47:56.507 --> 47:57.442
Okay.

47:57.475 --> 47:59.277
After you, my lady.

47:59.310 --> 48:00.645
Why thank you.

48:03.949 --> 48:06.317
(device beeping)

48:06.351 --> 48:07.953
Is this thing even working?

48:07.986 --> 48:10.055
Hey, this looks fun.

48:10.088 --> 48:11.022
What?

48:11.056 --> 48:12.490
Spring dance.

48:12.523 --> 48:14.325
Barry, we have no time for dancing.

48:14.359 --> 48:15.560
We have to find Robo-Dog,

48:15.593 --> 48:16.527
then fly back to New York

48:16.561 --> 48:18.463
for the last day of
the science convention.

48:18.496 --> 48:20.598
Hopefully somebody sees these flyers.

48:20.631 --> 48:21.632
Hopefully.

48:23.201 --> 48:23.969
Yeah, ma.

48:24.002 --> 48:25.336
I'll be there in about 15 minutes.

48:25.370 --> 48:26.171
I'm just picking
something up at the house.

48:26.204 --> 48:26.604
Hey, there's someone over there.

48:26.637 --> 48:27.305
I'll ask him.

48:27.338 --> 48:29.640
[Carson] Okay, love you too.

48:29.674 --> 48:31.142
[Tyler] Hi, excuse me, sir.

48:31.176 --> 48:32.010
Yeah?

48:32.043 --> 48:32.643
My friend and I are looking for...

48:32.677 --> 48:34.579
I haven't seen any dog.

48:34.612 --> 48:35.446
My dog.

48:36.647 --> 48:37.648
How did you know?

48:37.682 --> 48:38.516
What?

48:38.549 --> 48:41.519
There's a dog picture on your flyer.

48:42.553 --> 48:44.355
Right.

48:44.389 --> 48:45.556
We tracked him down to this neighborhood

48:45.590 --> 48:47.225
and we were wondering if you
just saw him walking around.

48:47.258 --> 48:49.927
(puzzled music)

48:58.136 --> 48:58.736
This dog?

48:58.769 --> 49:01.539
(bumbling music)

49:08.546 --> 49:10.081
Have I seen him?

49:10.115 --> 49:13.051
(suspicious music)

49:18.023 --> 49:19.324
You sure?

49:19.357 --> 49:21.192
What happened to him?

49:21.226 --> 49:22.427
We think somebody stole him.

49:22.460 --> 49:23.361
What?

49:23.394 --> 49:24.429
Stole him?

49:25.463 --> 49:27.365
Why would you think that?

49:27.398 --> 49:29.267
He wouldn't have come all
the way out here on his own.

49:29.300 --> 49:32.070
He would've found us by now.

49:32.103 --> 49:35.173
Maybe he lost his memory.

49:35.206 --> 49:37.442
Maybe he just wandered off,

49:39.144 --> 49:42.447
and maybe a really
nice family rescued him

49:43.448 --> 49:45.016
and saved him

49:45.050 --> 49:46.417
and made him happy.

49:48.353 --> 49:49.387
Maybe.

49:51.122 --> 49:52.457
Think about that.

49:52.490 --> 49:53.291
Okay.

49:53.324 --> 49:54.392
Thank you.

49:54.425 --> 49:55.626
You bet, Tyler.

49:57.162 --> 49:58.296
How did you know my name?

49:58.329 --> 49:59.364
What?

50:00.298 --> 50:01.399
I don't know.

50:02.500 --> 50:03.434
Hey wait.

50:13.111 --> 50:14.479
I gotta tell her.

50:17.148 --> 50:18.249
I gotta tell her.

50:18.283 --> 50:21.052
(touching music)

50:30.795 --> 50:34.399
Okay, there's no way
I'm going to tell her.

50:37.768 --> 50:39.237
Everything okay?

50:39.270 --> 50:40.238
Yeah.

50:40.271 --> 50:43.174
He just seemed a little
nervous about something.

50:43.208 --> 50:45.243
Don't worry, we'll find him.

50:45.276 --> 50:48.045
(bumbling music)

50:49.347 --> 50:50.348
Little help.

50:51.482 --> 50:52.450
Not again.

50:52.483 --> 50:53.318
I know.

50:55.586 --> 50:58.389
(sneaky music)

51:15.440 --> 51:18.376
[Mr. Sparky] Look, Mira,
there is a dance tomorrow.

51:18.409 --> 51:19.877
Yeah, that's the spring dance!

51:19.910 --> 51:21.679
They do it every year.

51:21.712 --> 51:24.715
I try to get my dad to
take me, but he never does.

51:24.749 --> 51:26.384
Can I take you?

51:26.417 --> 51:30.255
Wait, are you asking me
to be your dance partner?

51:30.288 --> 51:31.456
Sure.

51:31.489 --> 51:32.557
Okay!

51:32.590 --> 51:35.193
(calm music)

51:40.565 --> 51:41.399
Mira.

51:41.432 --> 51:42.500
Hi, Daddy.

51:42.533 --> 51:44.535
What are you doing out here?

51:44.569 --> 51:48.739
Oh, just showing Mr. Sparky
around the neighborhood.

51:49.574 --> 51:51.342
Where is your grandma?

51:51.376 --> 51:52.443
She's inside.

51:55.246 --> 51:56.381
Hey,

51:56.414 --> 51:57.248
mom?

51:59.884 --> 52:01.186
Yes?

52:01.219 --> 52:02.287
Really?

52:02.320 --> 52:04.655
You're just letting her roam
out here all by herself?

52:04.689 --> 52:06.224
It's okay.

52:06.257 --> 52:07.725
She has a guard dog.

52:09.594 --> 52:11.162
Guard dog.

52:11.196 --> 52:12.563
Okay, we're leaving now.

52:12.597 --> 52:13.664
Say goodbye to grandma.

52:13.698 --> 52:14.699
Bye, grandma!

52:14.732 --> 52:16.434
Bye, Mira!

52:16.467 --> 52:17.435
Bye, grandma!

52:17.468 --> 52:19.204
Bye, Mr. Sparky!

52:19.237 --> 52:20.405
Bye, grand

52:20.438 --> 52:22.240
ma.

52:22.273 --> 52:23.241
Okay, let's go.

52:23.274 --> 52:23.941
Come on.

52:23.974 --> 52:24.909
Are we going to get ice cream?

52:24.942 --> 52:26.677
Yeah yeah yeah, we
got ice cream at home.

52:26.711 --> 52:28.379
We do?

52:28.413 --> 52:29.280
I think we do.

52:29.314 --> 52:30.281
Come on, let's get in the car, come on.

52:30.315 --> 52:30.915
Yay ice cream!

52:30.948 --> 52:32.183
Yay, ice cream.

52:36.254 --> 52:37.555
Who wants ice cream?

52:37.588 --> 52:38.423
Me!

52:39.957 --> 52:41.359
That's not ice cream.

52:41.392 --> 52:42.593
Sure it is.

52:42.627 --> 52:43.561
We got ice.

52:46.431 --> 52:47.465
Cream.

52:51.236 --> 52:53.438
So, did you see the flyers?

52:55.406 --> 52:56.173
What flyers?

52:56.207 --> 52:59.344
The ones about the spring dance.

52:59.377 --> 53:02.480
Oh, the spring dance flyers, right.

53:03.381 --> 53:04.915
Oh yeah, I did.

53:04.949 --> 53:05.750
I did see those.

53:05.783 --> 53:07.318
They were...

53:07.352 --> 53:08.353
What about them?

53:08.386 --> 53:10.955
Mr. Sparky and I wanna go.

53:10.988 --> 53:14.359
I don't think that's a very good idea.

53:14.392 --> 53:15.593
Why?

53:15.626 --> 53:19.397
I think you and Robo-Dog,
your doggy dog, Mr. Sparky dog,

53:22.032 --> 53:23.634
should stay inside.

53:24.502 --> 53:25.536
Why?

53:25.570 --> 53:27.972
You've got so many toys
that you can show him.

53:28.005 --> 53:31.642
Oh, and you could binge-watch
all your favorite TV shows

53:31.676 --> 53:33.644
that you've been missing.

53:33.678 --> 53:35.446
I'd rather go to the dance.

53:35.480 --> 53:38.015
You can't go to a dance with a dog.

53:38.048 --> 53:39.984
You need an adult.

53:40.017 --> 53:41.419
You could take us.

53:41.452 --> 53:43.521
Yeah, you could take us!

53:43.554 --> 53:45.022
I walked right into that one.

53:45.055 --> 53:46.491
Please, please!

53:47.725 --> 53:50.461
Oh please please please please?

53:51.362 --> 53:54.499
Okay, I'll take you to the dance.

53:54.532 --> 53:55.199
Hooray!

53:55.232 --> 53:57.902
I'm gonna go work on my dress.

53:59.304 --> 54:00.971
Yay, dance!

54:01.005 --> 54:02.273
Yay, dance.

54:04.409 --> 54:05.443
Well.

54:06.977 --> 54:08.313
This is awkward.

54:08.346 --> 54:09.280
What is?

54:09.314 --> 54:10.948
I don't know how to dance.

54:10.981 --> 54:11.949
You don't?

54:11.982 --> 54:13.318
No.

54:13.351 --> 54:14.519
That's okay.

54:14.552 --> 54:16.421
I have the solution to your incompetence

54:16.454 --> 54:18.323
when it comes to dancing.

54:18.356 --> 54:18.956
Really?

54:18.989 --> 54:19.890
What's that?

54:19.924 --> 54:21.359
I can teach you.

54:21.392 --> 54:24.529
(laughs)
You know how to dance?

54:24.562 --> 54:25.963
I just learned.

54:27.498 --> 54:30.267
(amused music)

54:40.411 --> 54:42.880
Okay, are you ready?

54:42.913 --> 54:44.315
Sure.

54:44.349 --> 54:46.016
Put your hands up.

54:48.419 --> 54:49.620
Like that.

54:49.654 --> 54:50.455
Okay.

54:50.488 --> 54:51.322
Very good.

54:51.356 --> 54:54.925
Now go one two three, one two three.

54:54.959 --> 54:56.627
- One, two.
- One two three,...

54:56.661 --> 54:58.663
- ...one two three.
- Three one.

54:58.696 --> 55:00.965
Hmm, maybe a little faster.

55:00.998 --> 55:02.433
One two.

55:02.467 --> 55:04.001
- One two three.
- One.

55:04.034 --> 55:05.636
One two three.

55:05.670 --> 55:07.472
- One two three.
- One...

55:07.505 --> 55:09.440
- ...two three.
- One two three.

55:09.474 --> 55:10.675
One two three.

55:10.708 --> 55:11.609
You almost got it.

55:11.642 --> 55:13.077
Try again!

55:13.110 --> 55:15.680
One two three, one two three.

55:17.515 --> 55:19.116
Do you mind if I assist?

55:19.149 --> 55:20.385
Yeah, hop in.

55:21.686 --> 55:23.588
Okay, what do I do?

55:23.621 --> 55:24.955
Just follow along.

55:24.989 --> 55:26.156
I'll help you.

55:26.190 --> 55:30.628
[Mr. Sparky And Carson]
One two three, one two three.

55:30.661 --> 55:32.730
Okay, I think I got it.

55:35.065 --> 55:36.534
You're doing great!

55:36.567 --> 55:37.568
Keep it up!

55:37.602 --> 55:40.805
One two three, one two three.

55:40.838 --> 55:43.408
One two three, one two three.

55:44.174 --> 55:46.844
I sure hope none of the
neighbors are watching.

55:46.877 --> 55:48.112
Why is that?

55:48.145 --> 55:50.014
Because, two three,

55:50.047 --> 55:51.749
this is weird, two three.

55:51.782 --> 55:52.617
What is?

55:52.650 --> 55:53.884
I'm dancing

55:53.918 --> 55:55.420
in my living room

55:55.453 --> 55:56.721
with a dog

55:56.754 --> 55:58.122
with a guy's voice.

55:59.424 --> 56:01.892
Would you prefer I
speak with a female voice?

56:01.926 --> 56:05.396
No no no, just your
normal voice is fine.

56:05.430 --> 56:06.664
Three one two three.

56:06.697 --> 56:08.065
You're doing it!

56:08.098 --> 56:10.401
Three one two three.

56:10.435 --> 56:11.569
Okay, I think I got it.

56:11.602 --> 56:12.437
Spin me!

56:13.203 --> 56:14.472
Spin you how?

56:14.505 --> 56:15.706
Like this.

56:15.740 --> 56:16.507
Yah!

56:16.541 --> 56:17.708
Oh, nice.

56:17.742 --> 56:18.543
(laughs) Woohoo!

56:18.576 --> 56:20.411
One two three.

56:20.445 --> 56:21.512
Now you.

56:21.546 --> 56:22.480
Me what?

56:22.513 --> 56:23.147
Spin!

56:23.180 --> 56:24.181
Me spin?

56:24.214 --> 56:25.483
Spin!

56:25.516 --> 56:26.316
Okay.

56:26.350 --> 56:27.852
(Mr. Sparky laughs)
One two three.

56:27.885 --> 56:28.786
That's really good.

56:28.819 --> 56:30.821
One two three, you're a better spinner.

56:30.855 --> 56:31.989
Thanks.

56:32.022 --> 56:33.524
Now bow.

56:33.558 --> 56:34.391
Bow?

56:38.463 --> 56:40.064
All right, you bow.

56:43.501 --> 56:44.101
That's a good bow.

56:44.134 --> 56:45.169
Very good.

56:45.202 --> 56:48.105
I do believe you are ready
for the dance tomorrow.

56:48.138 --> 56:49.807
Yeah, you think so?

56:49.840 --> 56:51.008
Affirmative.

56:51.909 --> 56:52.743
Thanks.

56:54.479 --> 56:55.946
I owe you one.

56:55.980 --> 56:57.081
No problem.

56:58.115 --> 57:00.184
It is my programming to make Mira happy.

57:00.217 --> 57:02.186
I know that you taking Mira to the dance

57:02.219 --> 57:04.555
would make her the happiest.

57:06.190 --> 57:07.024
Yeah.

57:08.025 --> 57:11.829
I guess I haven't been
too attentive lately.

57:11.862 --> 57:14.164
It is never too late to
spend time with your family,

57:14.198 --> 57:16.000
but you should start soon

57:16.033 --> 57:18.836
or you may regret how much you missed.

57:18.869 --> 57:21.238
Makes a lot of sense.

57:21.271 --> 57:22.807
How'd you get to be so smart?

57:22.840 --> 57:24.809
I do not know.

57:24.842 --> 57:25.910
I wish I did.

57:29.279 --> 57:30.114
Hey.

57:34.519 --> 57:36.654
There's something I need to tell you.

57:36.687 --> 57:38.656
Oh, what is that, Carson Perry?

57:38.689 --> 57:41.158
(weighty music)

57:47.131 --> 57:50.034
You can just call me Carson.

57:50.067 --> 57:51.836
All right.

57:51.869 --> 57:53.237
Good night, Carson.

57:54.872 --> 57:56.473
Yeah, good night.

58:01.111 --> 58:03.848
(Barry snores)

58:03.881 --> 58:06.551
(relaxed music)

58:10.054 --> 58:12.823
(phone vibrates)

58:16.661 --> 58:17.795
Hey, dad.

58:17.828 --> 58:18.796
Hey, Tyler.

58:18.829 --> 58:20.230
Sorry for calling so late.

58:20.264 --> 58:23.267
I had a late session with Dr. Rants.

58:23.300 --> 58:24.201
That's okay.

58:24.234 --> 58:25.335
What's up?

58:25.369 --> 58:28.906
I'm just checking in,
making sure everything's okay.

58:28.939 --> 58:32.910
Yeah, the science fair
was delayed a little.

58:32.943 --> 58:34.111
Delayed?

58:34.144 --> 58:38.015
Yeah, just a minor accident
with Mentos and diet cola.

58:38.949 --> 58:41.185
You have to be very
careful with those two.

58:41.218 --> 58:44.154
Yeah, well it reconvenes tomorrow.

58:44.188 --> 58:45.022
You're still gonna make it out

58:45.055 --> 58:47.892
in time for my keynote speech, right?

58:47.925 --> 58:49.694
That's the plan.

58:49.727 --> 58:53.163
People are hounding me to see Robo-Dog.

58:54.999 --> 58:56.300
See what I did there?

58:56.333 --> 58:57.635
Very funny.

58:59.236 --> 59:00.638
I still got it.

59:01.706 --> 59:03.107
Good luck for tomorrow.

59:03.140 --> 59:03.941
Thanks.

59:03.974 --> 59:05.175
Gonna need it.

59:05.209 --> 59:07.311
Tyler, have faith,

59:07.344 --> 59:10.314
and always remember, you're a genius,

59:10.347 --> 59:12.249
just like your old man.

59:12.282 --> 59:13.250
Thanks, dad.

59:13.283 --> 59:14.284
Good night.

59:14.318 --> 59:15.820
Good night, son.

59:19.223 --> 59:20.591
(Barry snores)

59:20.625 --> 59:22.259
Workshop sandwiches.

59:24.328 --> 59:25.696
Oh hey, Tyler.

59:26.631 --> 59:27.965
Everything okay?

59:27.998 --> 59:30.000
Yeah, I just got a call from my dad.

59:30.034 --> 59:31.636
He was checking up on us.

59:31.669 --> 59:32.803
That's nice.

59:32.837 --> 59:34.271
Not really.

59:34.304 --> 59:35.239
We still haven't found Robo-Dog

59:35.272 --> 59:37.742
and we have to meet him
in a couple of days.

59:37.775 --> 59:39.309
I don't know what to do.

59:39.343 --> 59:41.946
We could always tell
him that we lost Robo-Dog.

59:41.979 --> 59:45.783
Yeah, I know, but I'd just rather wait.

59:45.816 --> 59:47.652
We already have the flyers up.

59:47.685 --> 59:49.153
I really hope someone calls.

59:49.186 --> 59:50.087
It'll be fine.

59:50.120 --> 59:51.221
You should get some rest.

59:51.255 --> 59:52.790
Tomorrow's a big day.

59:52.823 --> 59:53.891
You're right.

59:53.924 --> 59:55.059
Thanks.

59:55.092 --> 59:57.695
(Barry snores)

01:00:08.973 --> 01:00:10.274
[Carson] You ready?

01:00:10.307 --> 01:00:12.042
[Mr. Sparky] Ready.

01:00:12.076 --> 01:00:14.144
How do I look?

01:00:14.178 --> 01:00:15.212
Like a male human being,

01:00:15.245 --> 01:00:17.948
five foot 10 inches with
brown hair and brown eyes,

01:00:17.982 --> 01:00:19.283
wearing a suit.

01:00:19.316 --> 01:00:20.217
Right, right.

01:00:20.250 --> 01:00:23.721
When someone asks you, "How do I look?"

01:00:23.754 --> 01:00:26.957
you're supposed to say,
"Oh, you look great."

01:00:26.991 --> 01:00:28.025
I am?

01:00:28.058 --> 01:00:29.059
Let's try it again.

01:00:29.093 --> 01:00:30.194
How do I look?

01:00:30.227 --> 01:00:31.862
You look great.

01:00:33.363 --> 01:00:35.032
Ah, stop.

01:00:35.065 --> 01:00:36.901
Is my tie on straight?

01:00:41.271 --> 01:00:42.172
Wow.
(Laughs)

01:00:42.206 --> 01:00:43.240
Thanks, buddy.

01:00:43.273 --> 01:00:44.108
Let's go.

01:00:48.012 --> 01:00:49.814
(knocking on the door)

01:00:49.847 --> 01:00:51.949
Miss Mira Perry,

01:00:51.982 --> 01:00:54.451
it is your escorts to the dance.

01:00:54.484 --> 01:00:55.853
[Mira] Okay!

01:00:59.123 --> 01:01:00.858
Open the door, please.

01:01:00.891 --> 01:01:03.227
[Mira] Okay, okay, hold your horses!

01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:05.996
I don't own any horses.

01:01:06.030 --> 01:01:07.164
[Mira] I'm ready!

01:01:07.197 --> 01:01:08.232
Okay.

01:01:08.265 --> 01:01:10.434
[Mira] Close your eyes!

01:01:10.467 --> 01:01:11.902
Okay.

01:01:11.936 --> 01:01:13.103
[Mira] Are they closed?

01:01:13.137 --> 01:01:14.071
Yep.

01:01:14.104 --> 01:01:16.841
[Mira]
Are they really closed, Mr. Sparky?

01:01:16.874 --> 01:01:17.474
I do not know.

01:01:17.507 --> 01:01:18.843
My eyes are closed.

01:01:18.876 --> 01:01:22.412
They're closed, honey, they're closed.

01:01:22.446 --> 01:01:24.248
Okay, you can open your eyes!

01:01:24.281 --> 01:01:27.117
(sparkling music)

01:01:31.321 --> 01:01:33.023
How do I look?

01:01:33.057 --> 01:01:35.492
I have forgotten what
I am supposed to say.

01:01:35.525 --> 01:01:37.728
You look so beautiful.

01:01:44.534 --> 01:01:49.439
May I have the honor
of escorting you to...

01:01:49.473 --> 01:01:50.474
Of course!

01:01:51.508 --> 01:01:52.409
Shall we?

01:01:52.442 --> 01:01:53.243
We shall.

01:01:53.277 --> 01:01:56.246
(pleasant music)

01:02:01.786 --> 01:02:04.789
Mr. Sparky, would you
open the door, please?

01:02:04.822 --> 01:02:07.291
(elegant music)

01:02:09.894 --> 01:02:11.929
Very impressive.

01:02:11.962 --> 01:02:12.797
My lady.

01:02:16.066 --> 01:02:16.901
And sir.

01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:22.372
Off to the dance we go.

01:02:30.848 --> 01:02:32.149
Mr. Melch, Tyler,

01:02:32.182 --> 01:02:34.351
I'm certainly glad you
decided to come back.

01:02:34.384 --> 01:02:35.585
No problem.

01:02:35.619 --> 01:02:37.922
(laughs) We certainly had some
excitement for the opening,

01:02:37.955 --> 01:02:40.791
but hopefully we won't
have any more excitement,

01:02:40.825 --> 01:02:42.226
at least any more excitement like that,

01:02:42.259 --> 01:02:46.063
though science is certainly
exciting, isn't it?

01:02:46.096 --> 01:02:46.964
Yeah.

01:02:46.997 --> 01:02:47.832
The Fire Marshal's here to make sure

01:02:47.865 --> 01:02:49.533
that all of our projects are up to code

01:02:49.566 --> 01:02:52.469
and we won't have anymore problems.

01:02:53.470 --> 01:02:55.172
This one's good.

01:02:57.274 --> 01:02:59.209
Any who, let's get this puppy started.

01:02:59.243 --> 01:03:00.277
Come on, bow tie.

01:03:00.310 --> 01:03:01.378
Good luck.

01:03:01.411 --> 01:03:02.880
Got a good feeling about this.

01:03:02.913 --> 01:03:03.513
Me too.

01:03:03.547 --> 01:03:04.381
[Fireman] Nope!

01:03:04.414 --> 01:03:07.284
(bemused music)

01:03:19.463 --> 01:03:20.064
Thanks.

01:03:20.097 --> 01:03:21.298
[Miss Swisher] Have fun.

01:03:21.331 --> 01:03:22.132
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:03:22.166 --> 01:03:24.101
Enjoy, ladies.

01:03:24.134 --> 01:03:24.969
Hello.

01:03:25.002 --> 01:03:25.602
How many?

01:03:25.635 --> 01:03:26.436
Two, please.

01:03:26.470 --> 01:03:28.105
Two and a half!

01:03:30.975 --> 01:03:33.443
I'm sorry, but dogs are
not permitted in here.

01:03:33.477 --> 01:03:35.512
Oh that's not a real dog.

01:03:35.545 --> 01:03:38.048
Sure looks like a dog to me.

01:03:38.082 --> 01:03:39.216
That is the whole idea,

01:03:39.249 --> 01:03:41.218
but as he said, I am not.

01:03:41.251 --> 01:03:43.020
I am a robotic dog.

01:03:44.488 --> 01:03:45.956
Told you.

01:03:45.990 --> 01:03:49.193
Can we please bring Mr. Sparky in?

01:03:49.226 --> 01:03:50.294
Mr. Sparky?

01:03:51.361 --> 01:03:53.330
I guess it's okay.

01:03:53.363 --> 01:03:56.133
That's quite an impressive toy you have.

01:03:56.166 --> 01:03:57.001
Have fun.

01:03:58.002 --> 01:04:00.470
Don't forget to vote for
your favorite dancer.

01:04:00.504 --> 01:04:01.371
Are you ready?

01:04:01.405 --> 01:04:02.206
Ready.

01:04:02.239 --> 01:04:03.240
Okay.

01:04:03.273 --> 01:04:06.310
(exciting dance music)

01:04:17.054 --> 01:04:18.222
This is great.

01:04:18.255 --> 01:04:20.124
Hey, I'll get us some punch, all right?

01:04:20.157 --> 01:04:21.158
All right.

01:04:24.028 --> 01:04:25.930
[Carson] Two, please.

01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:32.302
Daddy, there are some of my friends!

01:04:32.336 --> 01:04:34.004
I'm gonna go say hi!

01:04:35.372 --> 01:04:37.374
Come on, Mr. Sparky.

01:04:37.407 --> 01:04:38.242
Enjoy the dance.

01:04:38.275 --> 01:04:39.276
Thanks.

01:04:39.309 --> 01:04:42.412
(upbeat dance music)

01:04:52.389 --> 01:04:53.457
Cheers.

01:04:53.490 --> 01:04:56.560
(upbeat dance music)

01:05:03.167 --> 01:05:05.035
Aw, he's so cute, what's his name?

01:05:05.069 --> 01:05:06.236
Mr. Sparky.

01:05:06.270 --> 01:05:09.006
[Three Girls] Hi, Mr. Sparky.

01:05:09.039 --> 01:05:09.673
Hello.

01:05:10.607 --> 01:05:12.609
Awesome, can he dance?

01:05:13.543 --> 01:05:14.911
Can I dance?

01:05:22.586 --> 01:05:25.589
(funky dance music)

01:05:27.057 --> 01:05:30.227
Go doggy, go doggy, go doggy!

01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:32.562
(people cheering)

01:05:32.596 --> 01:05:36.700
Go doggy, go doggy, go
doggy, go doggy, go doggy,

01:05:38.535 --> 01:05:42.606
go doggy, go doggy, go
doggy, go doggy, go doggy!

01:05:45.509 --> 01:05:47.577
Go doggy, go doggy!

01:05:47.611 --> 01:05:51.548
(people clapping and cheering)

01:05:54.684 --> 01:05:55.485
What's going on?

01:05:55.519 --> 01:05:56.686
There's a dancing dog.

01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:58.188
It's really cool.

01:05:58.222 --> 01:05:59.223
Oh my.

01:05:59.256 --> 01:06:02.359
(upbeat dance music)

01:06:09.066 --> 01:06:12.269
(people clapping and cheering)

01:06:12.302 --> 01:06:15.405
All right, and now it's
time to slow it down.

01:06:15.439 --> 01:06:18.375
(cheerful music)

01:06:26.583 --> 01:06:30.354
Aren't you gonna dance with me, Daddy?

01:06:30.387 --> 01:06:33.623
I would be honored to
have this dance with you.

01:06:33.657 --> 01:06:36.426
(laughs) Thanks.

01:06:38.162 --> 01:06:39.729
Let's put you down here.

01:06:39.763 --> 01:06:41.131
Ready?

01:06:41.165 --> 01:06:42.699
Nice and slow.

01:06:42.732 --> 01:06:47.404
* I don't wanna be pulled from your side

01:06:47.437 --> 01:06:49.306
* Warm hand

01:06:49.339 --> 01:06:51.741
* The safest touch

01:06:51.775 --> 01:06:55.712
* Hold your stance
while our postures brush

01:06:55.745 --> 01:07:00.117
* I don't wanna be pulled from your side

01:07:01.351 --> 01:07:05.522
* I'm stuck here hoping that
the next words come out right

01:07:09.293 --> 01:07:12.796
* It's the same old feels

01:07:14.131 --> 01:07:18.302
* It's the same old story

01:07:18.335 --> 01:07:21.738
* When the dream gets real

01:07:23.107 --> 01:07:25.275
* I don't wanna get up

01:07:25.309 --> 01:07:27.411
* I don't wanna be touched

01:07:27.444 --> 01:07:31.148
* It's the same old feels

01:07:32.416 --> 01:07:36.486
* It's the same old story

01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:40.324
* When the dream gets real *

01:07:41.158 --> 01:07:42.626
This is the best day ever.

01:07:42.659 --> 01:07:44.161
I love you, Daddy.

01:07:44.194 --> 01:07:46.096
I love you too.

01:07:46.130 --> 01:07:49.333
* It's the same old song

01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:54.171
* But this time it saves me

01:07:55.339 --> 01:07:58.342
* It's how you feel

01:07:59.343 --> 01:08:01.645
* I don't wanna give up

01:08:01.678 --> 01:08:04.781
* I don't wanna give up this time

01:08:04.814 --> 01:08:07.517
(people applauding)

01:08:07.551 --> 01:08:09.419
All right,

01:08:09.453 --> 01:08:12.422
ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,

01:08:12.456 --> 01:08:15.259
it is now time for me
to announce the winner

01:08:15.292 --> 01:08:19.296
for the year's best dancer
award for the spring dance.

01:08:19.328 --> 01:08:23.332
(people applauding and cheering)

01:08:23.367 --> 01:08:24.568
The award goes to...

01:08:27.337 --> 01:08:30.307
...Mr. Sparky, the robotic dancing dog.

01:08:30.340 --> 01:08:33.810
(people applauding and cheering)

01:08:33.843 --> 01:08:36.746
Congratulations, you won.

01:08:36.779 --> 01:08:37.881
I won?

01:08:37.913 --> 01:08:40.850
You really know how to boogie, huh?

01:08:40.884 --> 01:08:42.618
What is boogie?

01:08:42.652 --> 01:08:43.487
You know.

01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:46.622
(upbeat disco music)

01:08:47.524 --> 01:08:49.259
Nice moves.

01:08:49.292 --> 01:08:50.926
Oh.
(Laughs)

01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:54.698
I just want to present one
more very special award

01:08:54.731 --> 01:08:56.700
for the sweetest dance.

01:08:56.733 --> 01:09:00.569
It goes to Mira and her dad, Mr. Perry.

01:09:00.604 --> 01:09:01.270
Let's give it up.

01:09:01.305 --> 01:09:05.341
(people applauding and cheering)

01:09:05.375 --> 01:09:06.343
Congratulations.

01:09:06.376 --> 01:09:07.944
Right, congratulations!

01:09:07.977 --> 01:09:11.448
(people applauding and cheering)

01:09:11.481 --> 01:09:13.950
Thank you all for coming
to the spring dance,

01:09:13.983 --> 01:09:15.819
and have a good night.

01:09:17.386 --> 01:09:18.888
Can you believe this?

01:09:18.921 --> 01:09:19.856
I can.

01:09:19.889 --> 01:09:23.193
How about we celebrate
with some ice cream?

01:09:23.227 --> 01:09:23.893
Real ice cream?

01:09:23.926 --> 01:09:25.662
Real ice cream.

01:09:25.694 --> 01:09:26.462
Hooray, yippee!

01:09:26.496 --> 01:09:29.265
Hooray, yay for real ice cream!

01:09:29.299 --> 01:09:30.867
Mm, real ice cream!

01:09:35.538 --> 01:09:37.374
Congratulations on winning first prize.

01:09:37.407 --> 01:09:38.808
I knew you had it in you.

01:09:38.841 --> 01:09:40.377
Thanks, Barry.

01:09:40.410 --> 01:09:43.313
Man, I just wish Robo-Dog
were here to see this.

01:09:43.346 --> 01:09:45.881
(device beeping)

01:09:47.384 --> 01:09:47.984
Wait a minute.

01:09:48.017 --> 01:09:49.685
(device beeping)

01:09:49.719 --> 01:09:52.389
(hopeful music)

01:09:56.426 --> 01:09:57.894
It's picking up Robo-Dog!

01:09:57.927 --> 01:09:58.728
Where is he?

01:09:58.762 --> 01:09:59.563
He's that way!

01:09:59.596 --> 01:10:00.397
Come on!

01:10:00.430 --> 01:10:01.431
Run, Barry!

01:10:01.465 --> 01:10:03.433
That's not gonna happen.

01:10:05.802 --> 01:10:07.271
Ice cream!

01:10:07.304 --> 01:10:08.372
Ice cream!

01:10:08.405 --> 01:10:10.774
Uh-oh, sorry, buddy,
they don't allow dogs inside.

01:10:10.807 --> 01:10:12.976
We'll be right back, okay?

01:10:18.548 --> 01:10:20.750
It says he should be
around here somewhere.

01:10:20.784 --> 01:10:21.818
Good, maybe we can stop running

01:10:21.851 --> 01:10:24.220
and I can catch my breath.

01:10:26.055 --> 01:10:26.990
Robo-Dog!

01:10:30.694 --> 01:10:32.762
Robo-Dog, it's me, Tyler!

01:10:34.898 --> 01:10:36.566
Robo-Dog, over here.

01:10:38.368 --> 01:10:40.036
That's it, buddy, come here.

01:10:40.069 --> 01:10:42.939
I'm sorry, were you talking to me?

01:10:42.972 --> 01:10:44.908
Yes, we've been worried sick about you.

01:10:44.941 --> 01:10:46.343
Where have you been?

01:10:46.376 --> 01:10:48.778
I'm not sure I understand.

01:10:48.812 --> 01:10:49.813
Do I know you?

01:10:49.846 --> 01:10:51.348
Yeah, I'm Tyler.

01:10:53.417 --> 01:10:54.818
I'm your best friend, remember?

01:10:54.851 --> 01:10:57.354
Oh, nice to meet you, Tyler.

01:10:57.387 --> 01:10:58.955
I am Mr. Sparky.

01:10:58.988 --> 01:10:59.889
Oh.

01:10:59.923 --> 01:11:00.590
I'm Barry Melch.

01:11:00.624 --> 01:11:02.426
Nice to meet you, Mr. Sparky.

01:11:02.459 --> 01:11:06.563
No, your name is Robo-Dog
and you're my best friend.

01:11:06.596 --> 01:11:08.532
I believe you are mistaken.

01:11:08.565 --> 01:11:13.437
My name is Mr. Sparky and
Mira is my best friend.

01:11:13.470 --> 01:11:15.872
No, you're my best
friend and you're my dog.

01:11:15.905 --> 01:11:17.307
Now we're going home right now.

01:11:17.341 --> 01:11:18.642
Come on, Robo-Dog.

01:11:19.743 --> 01:11:21.845
Thank you for my ice cream, Daddy.

01:11:21.878 --> 01:11:23.547
You're welcome, honey.

01:11:23.580 --> 01:11:24.614
Let's get going.

01:11:24.648 --> 01:11:25.482
Come on.

01:11:27.617 --> 01:11:28.418
Okay.

01:11:28.452 --> 01:11:30.487
Come on, Mr. Sparky!

01:11:31.821 --> 01:11:32.656
Where are you going?

01:11:32.689 --> 01:11:35.359
(fretful music)

01:11:38.094 --> 01:11:39.429
You.

01:11:39.463 --> 01:11:41.331
Hey, I know you.

01:11:41.365 --> 01:11:43.667
Oh no, no, I don't think so.

01:11:47.437 --> 01:11:48.472
Would you look at that?

01:11:48.505 --> 01:11:50.674
Another robotic dog that
looks just like Robo-Dog.

01:11:50.707 --> 01:11:52.075
What are the odds?

01:11:52.108 --> 01:11:54.444
Barry, he's the guy
we showed the flyers to.

01:11:54.478 --> 01:11:55.712
Oh.

01:11:55.745 --> 01:11:57.381
He's the Robo-Dog-napper.

01:11:57.414 --> 01:11:58.582
Oh!

01:11:58.615 --> 01:12:00.450
Come on, we gotta go get him.

01:12:00.484 --> 01:12:01.250
Of course.

01:12:01.284 --> 01:12:02.619
Does that mean I have to run again?

01:12:02.652 --> 01:12:03.687
Yes, we know his address.

01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:04.354
Let's go.

01:12:06.923 --> 01:12:08.725
Can we hang this now, Daddy?

01:12:08.758 --> 01:12:10.527
Yeah, yeah, sure.

01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:12.896
I got hammer and nails in my office.

01:12:12.929 --> 01:12:15.098
[Mira] I'll go get them!

01:12:50.434 --> 01:12:51.601
[Tyler] My name is Tyler Austin,

01:12:51.635 --> 01:12:55.905
and this is my best friend
in the whole world, Robo-Dog.

01:12:55.939 --> 01:12:57.106
Robo-Dog is the best,

01:12:57.140 --> 01:13:00.143
and I can't imagine ever being apart.

01:13:00.176 --> 01:13:02.546
Did you find the hammer and nails?

01:13:02.579 --> 01:13:04.481
What's this?

01:13:04.514 --> 01:13:05.114
What?

01:13:05.148 --> 01:13:06.416
This video.

01:13:07.751 --> 01:13:08.585
Oh.

01:13:10.754 --> 01:13:12.556
You stole him!

01:13:12.589 --> 01:13:15.058
No, I didn't steal him.

01:13:15.091 --> 01:13:18.428
I found him and then I fixed him.

01:13:18.462 --> 01:13:20.764
You said you got him for me.

01:13:22.499 --> 01:13:24.534
Not technically.

01:13:24.568 --> 01:13:26.570
What do you mean?

01:13:26.603 --> 01:13:29.706
Look, sweetheart, it's complicated.

01:13:32.609 --> 01:13:34.010
You lied to me!

01:13:38.548 --> 01:13:40.650
Is Tyler my real owner?

01:13:44.921 --> 01:13:45.955
Yeah.

01:13:45.989 --> 01:13:47.591
Yeah he is.

01:13:47.624 --> 01:13:50.426
And my name isn't Mr. Sparky?

01:13:51.895 --> 01:13:52.729
No.

01:13:53.897 --> 01:13:55.064
It's Robo-Dog.

01:13:56.199 --> 01:13:58.067
Why did you do it?

01:13:59.669 --> 01:14:01.437
I didn't mean to.

01:14:02.772 --> 01:14:03.873
I was just...

01:14:05.241 --> 01:14:07.811
Things just got out of hand.

01:14:07.844 --> 01:14:10.480
I only wanted to make her happy.

01:14:10.514 --> 01:14:12.516
But you didn't though.

01:14:13.850 --> 01:14:15.985
You made her sad.

01:14:16.019 --> 01:14:16.820
I know.

01:14:16.853 --> 01:14:19.188
(sad music)

01:14:26.696 --> 01:14:28.164
These belong to you.

01:14:29.533 --> 01:14:33.503
What do you say we call your
family and get you home?

01:14:35.705 --> 01:14:38.975
(knocking on the door)

01:14:44.714 --> 01:14:46.516
I believe he belongs to you.

01:14:46.550 --> 01:14:48.184
Hello, Tyler.

01:14:48.217 --> 01:14:50.286
Robo-Dog, you remember me.

01:14:50.319 --> 01:14:51.287
Affirmative.

01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:53.823
My memory has returned.

01:14:53.857 --> 01:14:56.893
I am so sorry about all of this.

01:14:56.926 --> 01:14:59.529
He came to me pretty banged up,

01:14:59.563 --> 01:15:01.230
and by the time I fixed him,

01:15:01.264 --> 01:15:04.133
my daughter thought I got him for her,

01:15:04.167 --> 01:15:08.004
and everything just
spiraled out of control.

01:15:08.037 --> 01:15:10.073
Where'd you say you got a robotic dog?

01:15:10.106 --> 01:15:10.940
Amazon.

01:15:11.975 --> 01:15:12.776
Makes sense.

01:15:12.809 --> 01:15:14.177
Yeah.

01:15:14.210 --> 01:15:16.212
Come on, Robo-Dog, let's go.

01:15:16.245 --> 01:15:19.182
Excuse me, Tyler, before I go,

01:15:19.215 --> 01:15:21.284
I'd like to say goodbye to Mira.

01:15:21.317 --> 01:15:23.653
I'm sure she'd like that.

01:15:23.687 --> 01:15:24.320
Sure.

01:15:24.353 --> 01:15:25.188
Go ahead.

01:15:33.229 --> 01:15:35.732
Mira, I came to say goodbye.

01:15:38.602 --> 01:15:40.303
Mira, honey, come on.

01:15:41.971 --> 01:15:43.006
Say goodbye to Robo-Dog.

01:15:43.039 --> 01:15:45.642
(tender music)

01:15:49.813 --> 01:15:50.647
Oh no.

01:15:51.815 --> 01:15:54.317
It appears that Mira has run away,

01:15:54.350 --> 01:15:56.620
and I believe I know where.

01:15:56.653 --> 01:15:58.087
Can you show me where she went?

01:15:58.121 --> 01:15:59.288
Affirmative.

01:16:01.024 --> 01:16:04.127
(determined music)

01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:07.997
I am detecting the heat
imprints of her tracks.

01:16:08.031 --> 01:16:09.298
Wow, I didn't know you could do that.

01:16:09.332 --> 01:16:11.300
[Robo-Dog] After you replaced
my memory chip,

01:16:11.334 --> 01:16:14.137
I was able to recover
all my lost abilities.

01:16:14.170 --> 01:16:17.106
My sensors indicate she is very close.

01:16:17.140 --> 01:16:18.975
Good work, Robo-Dog.

01:16:21.277 --> 01:16:22.345
[Barry] Shes in there?

01:16:22.378 --> 01:16:24.247
Brave girl.

01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:26.349
Mira, are you up there?

01:16:29.218 --> 01:16:32.355
I am picking up a small reading on my...

01:16:32.388 --> 01:16:34.190
You really think that's her?

01:16:34.223 --> 01:16:36.159
I believe that it is.

01:16:37.193 --> 01:16:41.998
[Carson] Hey, honey, why
don't you come down, okay?

01:16:42.031 --> 01:16:42.866
Go away!

01:16:43.867 --> 01:16:45.702
[Carson] Honey, I...

01:16:48.171 --> 01:16:49.405
Sweetheart, please come down, okay,

01:16:49.438 --> 01:16:51.675
we can talk about this.

01:16:51.708 --> 01:16:53.376
No, I'm mad at you.

01:16:53.409 --> 01:16:54.310
I know you are.

01:16:54.343 --> 01:16:57.080
I know you're mad, and I'm really sorry.

01:16:57.113 --> 01:16:58.214
I shouldn't have misled you,

01:16:58.247 --> 01:17:00.349
but I won't do it again.

01:17:00.383 --> 01:17:02.652
[Mira] Don't come up here!

01:17:02.686 --> 01:17:04.353
Just come on down.

01:17:06.255 --> 01:17:08.024
Why should I?

01:17:08.057 --> 01:17:09.192
Mira, no, hey!

01:17:11.094 --> 01:17:12.862
(banging on the door)

01:17:12.896 --> 01:17:13.730
Mira!

01:17:14.463 --> 01:17:16.165
Get away from the ledge.

01:17:16.199 --> 01:17:19.168
(troubled music)

01:17:22.338 --> 01:17:23.707
[Barry] Hang on!

01:17:23.740 --> 01:17:24.340
Don't go anywhere!

01:17:24.373 --> 01:17:25.174
Don't move!

01:17:25.208 --> 01:17:28.077
(frantic music)

01:17:31.180 --> 01:17:32.215
Mira!

01:17:33.116 --> 01:17:34.818
Mira, get away from the ledge!

01:17:34.851 --> 01:17:37.153
Do you promise to never lie again?

01:17:37.186 --> 01:17:39.155
Yeah, absolutely.

01:17:39.188 --> 01:17:41.124
Say you promise!

01:17:41.157 --> 01:17:42.158
I promise.

01:17:43.192 --> 01:17:44.193
I promise.

01:17:44.227 --> 01:17:46.462
Now just give me your hand.

01:17:46.495 --> 01:17:47.296
Honey.

01:17:47.330 --> 01:17:48.998
Okay, I'll come down.

01:17:49.032 --> 01:17:50.199
Mira, honey.

01:17:50.233 --> 01:17:51.467
Mira!
(Mira screams)

01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:52.936
Mira!

01:17:52.969 --> 01:17:54.370
(Mira screams)

01:17:54.403 --> 01:17:55.238
Mira!

01:17:56.339 --> 01:17:57.707
[Barry] Don't fall!

01:17:57.741 --> 01:17:58.341
Hold on!

01:17:58.374 --> 01:18:00.176
Hold on, I got you!

01:18:02.245 --> 01:18:03.913
I got you!

01:18:03.947 --> 01:18:04.748
(Mira screams)

01:18:04.781 --> 01:18:05.749
Mira!

01:18:05.782 --> 01:18:07.150
I've got you!

01:18:07.183 --> 01:18:10.119
(triumphant music)

01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:13.389
Yeah, go Robo-Dog!

01:18:13.422 --> 01:18:14.858
Wow.

01:18:14.891 --> 01:18:15.491
Need a lift?

01:18:15.524 --> 01:18:18.227
(proud music)

01:18:22.098 --> 01:18:23.432
Wow, I'm flying.

01:18:23.466 --> 01:18:27.837
Affirmative, although
technically I'm not supposed to.

01:18:28.504 --> 01:18:29.906
Good job, Robo-Dog!

01:18:29.939 --> 01:18:32.842
(triumphant music)

01:18:37.313 --> 01:18:40.249
Let's bring you back to your dad.

01:18:42.551 --> 01:18:44.020
[Mira] Daddy!

01:18:44.854 --> 01:18:46.923
Oh, I got you.

01:18:46.956 --> 01:18:47.791
I got you.

01:18:49.092 --> 01:18:50.426
[Mira] I flew, Daddy.

01:18:50.459 --> 01:18:51.861
You did.

01:18:51.895 --> 01:18:53.296
You did fly, honey.

01:18:56.432 --> 01:18:57.967
Thank you, buddy.

01:18:58.001 --> 01:18:59.268
It was my pleasure.

01:18:59.302 --> 01:19:02.138
(beeping)

01:19:02.171 --> 01:19:03.006
Uh-oh.

01:19:04.107 --> 01:19:04.941
Whoa!

01:19:07.243 --> 01:19:08.244
(thudding)

01:19:08.277 --> 01:19:11.247
(troubled music)

01:19:21.224 --> 01:19:23.059
Robo-Dog!

01:19:23.092 --> 01:19:25.328
Robo-Dog, are you okay?

01:19:25.361 --> 01:19:26.195
Robo-Dog, stay with me.

01:19:26.229 --> 01:19:28.898
Come on, come on, buddy.

01:19:28.932 --> 01:19:29.765
Wake up!

01:19:31.100 --> 01:19:33.236
(sad music)

01:19:35.604 --> 01:19:37.974
(beeping)

01:19:46.249 --> 01:19:47.083
Hmm?

01:19:47.951 --> 01:19:49.118
What happened?

01:19:51.287 --> 01:19:54.423
You crash landed, but
Mr. Perry was able to fix you.

01:19:54.457 --> 01:19:56.492
It was no big deal.

01:19:56.525 --> 01:19:58.494
He had a little gyro issue.

01:19:58.527 --> 01:20:00.163
I took care of it.

01:20:00.196 --> 01:20:01.865
Thank you, Carson.

01:20:02.498 --> 01:20:05.268
No, I should be thanking you.

01:20:05.301 --> 01:20:08.304
I almost lost my little girl.

01:20:08.337 --> 01:20:11.274
You guys have a pretty amazing dog here.

01:20:11.307 --> 01:20:12.541
Yeah.

01:20:12.575 --> 01:20:14.177
Yeah we do.

01:20:14.210 --> 01:20:15.278
Technically it's not mine,

01:20:15.311 --> 01:20:17.446
but I did help name him.

01:20:17.480 --> 01:20:18.882
Anyway,

01:20:18.915 --> 01:20:21.384
I'm really sorry for everything.

01:20:23.987 --> 01:20:27.223
Is there any way you could forgive me?

01:20:27.256 --> 01:20:28.157
Of course we can.

01:20:28.191 --> 01:20:31.260
Anything I could do to make up for it?

01:20:31.294 --> 01:20:32.595
I have a suggestion.

01:20:32.628 --> 01:20:34.263
What's that?

01:20:34.297 --> 01:20:36.866
I would ask that you
be Mira's best friend.

01:20:36.900 --> 01:20:38.968
Play tea party with her, dance with her,

01:20:39.002 --> 01:20:41.170
and most of all, love her.

01:20:42.471 --> 01:20:44.340
I could do that.

01:20:44.373 --> 01:20:45.909
And ice cream!

01:20:45.942 --> 01:20:47.476
And ice cream, yes.

01:20:52.548 --> 01:20:56.085
Goodbye, Mr. Sparky, I mean, Robo-Dog.

01:20:56.986 --> 01:21:01.290
Mira, you can call me Mr. Sparky
anytime you want.

01:21:01.324 --> 01:21:03.226
I'm gonna miss you so much.

01:21:03.259 --> 01:21:05.861
I am going to miss you too.

01:21:07.096 --> 01:21:10.967
Please tell Theodora and
Frogerina that I said goodbye.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:11.634
I will.

01:21:16.072 --> 01:21:19.075
I bet one day Robo-Dog
will come back and visit

01:21:19.108 --> 01:21:22.278
and we can have one giant
tea party, all of us.

01:21:22.311 --> 01:21:23.346
Would you like that?

01:21:23.379 --> 01:21:24.413
Yeah.

01:21:25.348 --> 01:21:26.682
That would be great!

01:21:26.715 --> 01:21:28.084
Can I, Tyler?

01:21:28.117 --> 01:21:28.751
Of course.

01:21:28.784 --> 01:21:31.187
We can come visit sometime.

01:21:32.455 --> 01:21:35.224
This is all sweet and wonderful and

01:21:35.258 --> 01:21:37.660
but we gotta be in New
York in a couple of hours

01:21:37.693 --> 01:21:41.264
and I don't know how
we're gonna get there.

01:21:41.297 --> 01:21:42.932
I do.

01:21:42.966 --> 01:21:44.333
You do?

01:21:44.367 --> 01:21:47.336
(upbeat music)

01:21:47.370 --> 01:21:48.171
[Barry] Whoa!

01:21:48.204 --> 01:21:49.038
Oh boy!

01:21:50.106 --> 01:21:52.308
Oh boy!
(Laughs)

01:21:52.341 --> 01:21:55.144
Whoa!
(Laughs)

01:21:56.145 --> 01:21:56.980
Wow.

01:21:59.415 --> 01:22:00.316
(Barry and Tyler shouting)

01:22:00.349 --> 01:22:02.218
Oh boy, oh boy!

01:22:02.251 --> 01:22:04.653
Are you guys okay?

01:22:04.687 --> 01:22:06.956
Yes, just please be careful.

01:22:06.990 --> 01:22:09.258
So none of this?

01:22:09.292 --> 01:22:10.226
Woo woo!

01:22:10.259 --> 01:22:11.294
(Tyler and Barry screaming)

01:22:11.327 --> 01:22:14.163
(Robo-Dog laughs)

01:22:17.300 --> 01:22:19.368
No, none of that!

01:22:19.402 --> 01:22:21.037
(Robo-Dog laughs)

01:22:21.070 --> 01:22:22.371
Look, there it is!

01:22:26.342 --> 01:22:28.377
We'll be there soon, Tom!

01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:34.350
I can see everyone's house from here!

01:22:36.419 --> 01:22:39.022
I wonder if my cellphone works.

01:22:40.289 --> 01:22:41.157
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:22:41.190 --> 01:22:43.226
thank you very much for coming today.

01:22:43.259 --> 01:22:44.493
I appreciate that.

01:22:44.527 --> 01:22:46.062
Where are you?

01:22:46.795 --> 01:22:49.298
You and Barry promised me you'd be here

01:22:49.332 --> 01:22:51.234
in time for my speech.

01:22:51.267 --> 01:22:53.669
I'm really starting to get worried.

01:22:53.702 --> 01:22:54.703
Everything okay?

01:22:54.737 --> 01:22:57.340
Oh, yeah, Dr. Rants, perfect.

01:23:01.077 --> 01:23:02.478
Jiminy jumper nuts!

01:23:11.220 --> 01:23:12.088
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:23:12.121 --> 01:23:15.424
it is my pleasure to introduce to you,

01:23:15.458 --> 01:23:20.329
inventor extraordinaire
and creator of Robo-Dog,

01:23:20.363 --> 01:23:21.797
Mr. Tom Austin!

01:23:21.830 --> 01:23:25.034
(audience applauds)

01:23:31.540 --> 01:23:35.711
Thank you, Dr. Rants, for
that flattering introduction.

01:23:37.113 --> 01:23:38.347
Thank all of you.

01:23:39.815 --> 01:23:44.387
You, people who, (laughs) well,

01:23:44.420 --> 01:23:46.655
I have admired my entire life.

01:23:46.689 --> 01:23:49.525
(scurrying music)

01:23:52.261 --> 01:23:54.363
(laughs)

01:23:55.498 --> 01:23:57.400
If I had to make a list of people

01:23:57.433 --> 01:24:00.703
that I most wanted to
impress in my life,

01:24:00.736 --> 01:24:03.206
these faces would be on it.

01:24:05.174 --> 01:24:05.808
Whew!

01:24:10.613 --> 01:24:14.317
I've dreamed of being
in a room like this.

01:24:16.652 --> 01:24:17.486
Dr. Rants,

01:24:19.122 --> 01:24:20.589
I have to be honest,

01:24:22.258 --> 01:24:26.429
I was supposed to have my invention
Robo-Dog here tonight,

01:24:27.396 --> 01:24:29.265
but in fact, he's...

01:24:32.301 --> 01:24:33.869
Did somebody say my name?
