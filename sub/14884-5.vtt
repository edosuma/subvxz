00:51.751 --> 00:53.686
You did beautifully, Kim.

00:55.055 --> 00:58.158
I'm gonna put a little blood pressure clip
on your arm.

01:02.128 --> 01:03.530
She feels warm enough.

01:05.331 --> 01:06.599
You're gonna be okay.

08:37.216 --> 08:39.318
<i>Well, I'm on the golf course</i>

08:39.385 --> 08:42.054
<i>all by my little lonesome,</i>
<i>smacking balls away.</i>

08:45.591 --> 08:47.059
<i>The other day I had Kylie out.</i>

08:47.126 --> 08:49.996
<i>We were talking, you know,</i>
<i>about stuff and life,</i>

08:50.062 --> 08:54.400
<i>but she also said that she was upset</i>
<i>with you and not talking to you.</i>

10:38.571 --> 10:39.405
The French Manicure.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.245
Of course he is.

14:34.473 --> 14:37.109
Malika doesn't want you to sit here.

14:39.011 --> 14:39.912
Malikaâ€¦

14:42.581 --> 14:44.316
He wants to talk to Malika.

14:44.383 --> 14:46.318
You know that's my heart, right?

14:47.686 --> 14:49.255
I don't know what I did to you.

14:49.321 --> 14:53.158
It's like, if you giving her that vibe
like you mad at me,

14:53.225 --> 14:56.128
then she start doing other things,
this and that, and making me feel like,

14:56.195 --> 14:57.363
"Oh, Malika's making her do it."

15:19.618 --> 15:22.421
When you break up with someone,
you do not hang out with them.

21:04.429 --> 21:05.297
Oh, that's so good.

22:40.359 --> 22:41.827
Was I ever in La Jolla?

41:13.070 --> 41:14.839
What the f*** are you doing?
