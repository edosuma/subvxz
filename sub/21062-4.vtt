at the numbers,

The statistics _
are defInItely Impresswe.

22:43.230 --> 22:45.004
But I wanna get
past the numbers,

that the DOJ cut
Diversion funding
by more than 30%.

23:12.120 --> 23:15.123
Or are you so intent
on scoring points
with your new boss

23:15.170 --> 23:17.252
that you're giving
the administration
a pass on that?

23:19.440 --> 23:21.089
That's what I thought.

23:21.130 --> 23:23.212
This is why no one else
from the office

23:23.270 --> 23:24.487

on the record.

36:15.520 --> 36:16.908
You fool.

36:16.950 --> 36:19.771
Maybe I ain't all that.
Sorry.

36:19.820 --> 36:22.994
It felt good to do
an honest day's worth
of labor.

36:25.740 --> 36:28.482
You know,
I think I might go out
and try to ﬁnd a job.

36:30.100 --> 36:33.183
You're just restless,
baby, that's all.

36:33.230 --> 36:37.018
Shoot, you busted
your rump for 20 years.

36:37.060 --> 36:40.757
You got money in the bank,
more on the way, so...

36:40.800 --> 36:42.495
take some time.

36:42.540 --> 36:44.929
_ Don't rush
Into somethIng else.

36:44.980 --> 36:46.368
Baby, I like working.

36:46.420 --> 36:47.899
I know.
I do, too.

36:47.940 --> 36:49.453
But they got us thinking

36:49.510 --> 36:52.024
that we're supposed
to work until we die.

36:52.070 --> 36:55.369
And if we don't,
we the problem.

36:56.730 --> 36:58.686
Well, that ain't
my American dream.

36:58.730 --> 37:00.334
Is that yours?

37:00.390 --> 37:02.517
Nah.

37:02.560 --> 37:04.118
Do you know
what my dream is?

37:05.610 --> 37:07.043
This.

37:07.090 --> 37:09.263
Waking up beside you
every morning,

37:09.310 --> 37:11.653
going to bed beside you
every night.

37:14.010 --> 37:15.705
How we fill in
the rest of the time,

37:15.750 --> 37:17.968
it really don't matter.

37:18.010 --> 37:20.661
Of course it does.

37:20.710 --> 37:24.316
What, and you think
you ain't wasting your time
at the High Yellow?

37:24.370 --> 37:27.271
I see the look on your face
when you running around.

37:27.330 --> 37:28.456
That ain't
the look of love.

37:30.680 --> 37:33.148
It's the look
of determination.

37:33.200 --> 37:35.543
I worked my butt off
for that promotion.

37:35.600 --> 37:37.113
I know you did.

37:39.250 --> 37:41.855
But I always see you
at your most happiest

37:41.910 --> 37:43.423
when you
in yourkitchen.

37:45.690 --> 37:48.739
So tell me, what does
your dream look like?

37:51.570 --> 37:53.265
What does it look like?

37:58.100 --> 37:59.442
I guess it--

38:02.060 --> 38:03.482
it looks like...

38:06.060 --> 38:09.234
me making people happy
with my food...

38:09.280 --> 38:10.451
my pies.

38:12.590 --> 38:17.152
I... guess it's me
having my own business.

38:19.380 --> 38:22.725
You saying that
like it can't happen.

38:22.770 --> 38:24.943
Look”.

38:24.990 --> 38:27.868
let me figure out
what to do next.

38:29.390 --> 38:31.824
But I_ want
you to ﬁgure out
the same thing.

38:34.830 --> 38:37.344
We ain't too old
to get ours, baby.

38:41.400 --> 38:42.742
We ain't.

38:54.110 --> 38:55.498
I didn't touch
anything.

38:57.850 --> 38:59.408
That's okay.

39:01.120 --> 39:04.021
Um, I wanted to thank you
for sharing your room with me.

39:11.130 --> 39:13.030
Look, I'm sorry I hit you.

39:13.080 --> 39:15.605
It was an accident,
but that doesn't make it okay.

39:15.650 --> 39:18.733
I just want you to know
that I will never
hurt you agaIn.

39:18.790 --> 39:21.429
I'm sorry, too.

39:21.480 --> 39:23.482
I didn't ask you
if you wanted to play.

39:23.530 --> 39:26.579
You never have
to ask WIth me, ever.

39:28.490 --> 39:30.185
Ooh, I got you something.

39:49.730 --> 39:52.722
Charley, did you leave
anything in the store?

39:52.780 --> 39:55.908
Well, we basically came here
with the clothes on our backs.

39:55.950 --> 39:58.259
Takes more than that
to make a home.

39:58.300 --> 40:02.430
Well, whatever you have
back in storage in Los Angeles,

40:02.480 --> 40:05.483
I don't think any of it's
gonna work in here.

She's right.

40:07.050 --> 40:09.132
I don't see
a home theater.

40:09.180 --> 40:11.444
You sure about
living at the mill?

40:11.490 --> 40:14.448
Well, you can't get
much closer to the community
than this, right?

Grandma got that
on a trip to Egypt.

40:26.240 --> 40:27.855
Gave it to me
when I left for college.

40:27.900 --> 40:30.505
It's sort of
a good luck charm.

40:30.550 --> 40:32.074
Think it works?

Baby, if you're uncomfortable
with this, just say the word.

40:37.210 --> 40:39.735
I can always undo
a crazy last-minute decision.

40:39.780 --> 40:42.169
No, I'm tired
of moving around.

40:42.220 --> 40:44.085
Besides, it'll be fun
to watch you rough it.

Anybody wanna bet
how long it'll be

40:47.570 --> 40:49.174
before Mom decides
to move out?

40:49.220 --> 40:51.268
- Four days.
- Two months.

40:51.310 --> 40:54.746
- A couple hours.
- Violet: Y'all give
Charley a break.

40:54.800 --> 40:56.483
And the answer is
she won't last

to put on his drawers.
- Okay.

41:18.300 --> 41:21.258
- She told you
about what happened?
- Enough.

41:21.300 --> 41:23.939
She thinks
it was the Boudreauxs
called the cops on you.

She probably right.

Your final paycheck.

41:45.930 --> 41:47.534
What?

41:47.590 --> 41:49.751
I specifically told you
not to leave,

41:49.810 --> 41:51.971
and you did anyway.

You're fired,

These are the consequences.
