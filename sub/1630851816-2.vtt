ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

00:48.256 --> 00:50.467
AUGUST 13, 1987

01:15.950 --> 01:18.828
NO TRESPASSING

01:33.968 --> 01:35.553
Is it okay to be here?

01:35.637 --> 01:38.181
It's okay. I come here all the time.

01:40.975 --> 01:42.811
Where are you taking us?

01:48.733 --> 01:50.318
It's down here.

01:50.401 --> 01:52.153
I'd rather not go down there.

01:52.237 --> 01:54.114
Then why did you come all the way here?

02:06.835 --> 02:08.586
Do you come here often?

02:09.129 --> 02:10.130
Yes.

02:10.213 --> 02:12.298
My friends hang out at this hideout.

02:12.966 --> 02:14.050
This place?

02:15.218 --> 02:17.178
-What do you do here?
-What else?

02:18.721 --> 02:19.681
We drink.

02:22.100 --> 02:23.852
-Is that it?
-Yes.

02:27.856 --> 02:29.232
31906MA

02:29.315 --> 02:31.651
I HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN IT YET. HAVE YOU?

02:32.610 --> 02:34.070
I think we should take pictures.

02:34.696 --> 02:36.614
What? Okay.

02:39.617 --> 02:41.161
When did that appear there?

02:42.328 --> 02:45.540
I don't know when, but we saw it
for the first time yesterday.

02:46.457 --> 02:48.167
It wasn't here last week.

02:48.251 --> 02:50.128
Someone probably wrote it
since our last visit.

02:51.129 --> 02:53.423
How many times have you come here?

02:54.382 --> 02:55.466
Seven times.

02:56.509 --> 02:58.344
And we're the first to come here, right?

02:58.428 --> 03:01.556
Yes. Nobody comes here except my friends.

03:03.558 --> 03:05.935
But something is off about it.

03:07.103 --> 03:08.313
It's creepy.

03:11.065 --> 03:13.151
Tak, I'm scared.

03:14.819 --> 03:16.154
What's there to be scared of?

03:17.530 --> 03:18.781
What is that?

03:19.365 --> 03:20.450
What?

03:21.826 --> 03:24.370
What do you call that kind of drawing?

03:26.289 --> 03:27.498
Is it a symbol?

03:45.475 --> 03:47.393
Three, one, nine, zero, six…

03:48.978 --> 03:50.355
"I haven't

03:51.189 --> 03:52.607
forgotten it yet."

04:03.910 --> 04:05.787
Mom, I'm home.

04:16.381 --> 04:17.840
You're home?

04:17.924 --> 04:18.967
Whose baby is that?

04:22.553 --> 04:23.846
Jung-hyun.

04:23.930 --> 04:26.266
Don't raise your voice.
You'll frighten the baby.

04:28.184 --> 04:29.269
Actually,

04:30.770 --> 04:33.815
your brother is in that room.

04:34.482 --> 04:36.901
-What?
-He showed up all of a sudden

04:36.985 --> 04:38.569
after not calling us for years.

04:42.782 --> 04:45.285
-What did he say?
-Say what?

04:45.368 --> 04:47.120
Where had he been?

04:47.203 --> 04:48.204
Well…

04:50.248 --> 04:51.291
I don't know.

04:52.125 --> 04:53.418
He won't tell me.

05:25.241 --> 05:26.617
Who are you?

05:28.077 --> 05:29.579
Who is your dad?

05:32.790 --> 05:36.127
I'm not sure, but…

05:42.925 --> 05:44.719
I think I'm your aunt.

05:46.179 --> 05:47.346
Aunt.

05:59.984 --> 06:00.860
JULY 16, 1999

06:00.943 --> 06:01.903
Jae-young!

06:02.904 --> 06:04.363
Jae-young!

06:23.508 --> 06:24.759
I found it!

06:32.308 --> 06:33.476
What did you find?

06:33.559 --> 06:35.311
A phone. I found a phone.

06:35.394 --> 06:36.437
A phone?

06:37.230 --> 06:39.315
Anything else? Did you find anything else?

06:39.398 --> 06:41.359
No. Just the phone.

07:09.428 --> 07:12.181
SOOK CHINESE RESTAURANT

08:09.697 --> 08:11.699
<i>The body has been identified.</i>

08:11.782 --> 08:14.035
<i>Her daughter has also gone missing
after she was </i>

08:14.118 --> 08:17.330
<i>last seen at a local precinct
on the day of the murder.</i>

08:17.413 --> 08:21.501
<i>The killer committed the crime
in the bathroom on the 12th.</i>

08:21.584 --> 08:24.128
<i>The manner in which the attack
unfolded was quite brutal.</i>

08:24.212 --> 08:27.673
<i>Unlike other murder cases,
the victim sustained multiple</i>

08:27.757 --> 08:29.967
<i>stab wounds on the face.</i>

08:30.051 --> 08:32.136
<i>The killer showed such excessive cruelty,</i>

08:32.220 --> 08:34.555
<i>-even the police</i>
-Stop watching TV and get some rest.

08:34.639 --> 08:36.349
<i>are currently investigating.</i>

08:36.432 --> 08:39.435
<i>Three days after this murder,</i>

08:39.519 --> 08:42.939
<i>a middle school student,
Cho, has gone missing.</i>

08:43.022 --> 08:45.691
<i>The police say the two missing girls
went to the same…</i>

08:50.363 --> 08:51.447
Mom.

09:01.582 --> 09:03.000
Jae-young…

09:04.835 --> 09:07.713
I'll give my life if I have to
in order to find her.

09:10.591 --> 09:12.385
So please don't watch the news.

09:16.472 --> 09:17.807
Please just listen to me.

10:01.851 --> 10:03.811
Oh, sorry. Did I wake you?

10:05.730 --> 10:07.815
-What time is it?
-It's 8 a.m.

10:08.566 --> 10:09.775
You only got two hours of sleep.

10:11.569 --> 10:13.446
Damn it. I have to go to work.

10:14.196 --> 10:16.616
Have some breakfast before you go. Okay?

10:22.079 --> 10:25.207
It's your first murder case
after being assigned here.

10:25.833 --> 10:26.709
I know.

10:26.792 --> 10:29.420
I was watching the news in the morning
and I felt a little weird.

10:30.463 --> 10:32.506
Since you're handling that case,

10:32.590 --> 10:35.843
everything they were reporting
on the news sounded so tragic.

10:36.344 --> 10:38.137
The media is having a field day.

10:38.763 --> 10:40.097
It puts more pressure on us.

10:43.559 --> 10:47.605
The missing girl is
Jo Kyung-ho's daughter, right?

10:52.401 --> 10:54.612
Now that I think of it,
I guess you might know her family.

10:55.655 --> 10:56.989
Have you called them?

10:57.740 --> 10:58.866
Not yet.

11:00.201 --> 11:02.536
What about your partner?
Did he say anything?

11:03.120 --> 11:04.497
No, not much.

11:05.498 --> 11:08.167
Jo Kyung-ho is a separate matter
from the missing victim.

11:10.503 --> 11:12.296
It won't be easy for him either.

11:44.453 --> 11:46.122
Were you also called
to the principal's office?

12:05.850 --> 12:09.311
So you last saw her at lunchtime
on the day she went missing?

12:10.771 --> 12:13.649
-Yes.
-Did Jae-young

12:13.732 --> 12:16.485
talk to anyone on the phone or get a call?

12:17.445 --> 12:19.071
No, she didn't talk to anyone.

12:20.448 --> 12:23.033
Just tell us whatever you remember.

12:23.659 --> 12:25.703
It doesn't matter
even if it's a small detail.

12:28.539 --> 12:30.458
-Well…
-Go on.

12:30.541 --> 12:32.126
Do you remember something?

12:32.835 --> 12:35.045
The thing is, a few days ago,

12:35.129 --> 12:38.090
Jae-young was with us
in the broadcasting room.

12:38.883 --> 12:41.719
But someone suddenly knocked on the door.

12:42.595 --> 12:43.929
We went to the door

12:44.638 --> 12:48.058
and someone had left
something strange by the door.

12:48.142 --> 12:50.019
Why are you telling them that?

12:50.102 --> 12:52.021
He told us to share anything we remember.

12:52.104 --> 12:54.899
It's okay. Keep going.
What did that person leave there?

12:54.982 --> 12:57.026
-A cassette tape.
-A cassette tape?

12:58.694 --> 13:00.112
What kind of tape?

13:00.654 --> 13:02.990
It was a brain-enhancing tape.

13:03.073 --> 13:04.825
Lee's Genius Academy sells it to students.

13:04.909 --> 13:06.076
Brain enhancement?

13:06.660 --> 13:08.120
What kind of tape is that?

13:08.204 --> 13:10.706
At first, we thought the tape contained

13:10.789 --> 13:13.250
leaked questions from the upcoming exam.

13:13.334 --> 13:14.752
But it wasn't.

13:15.461 --> 13:17.505
It was like
a brain-enhancing technique tape.

13:17.588 --> 13:19.548
Supposedly, it improves
your concentration.

13:21.008 --> 13:22.426
What are you talking about?

13:23.052 --> 13:25.221
Who is leaking exam questions?

13:25.304 --> 13:26.514
There's a rumor that

13:26.597 --> 13:29.892
Lee's Genius Academy sells
exam questions to students.

13:29.975 --> 13:32.394
Since Kyung-jin
was going to that academy,

13:32.478 --> 13:34.271
I don't think it's entirely irrelevant.

13:34.355 --> 13:35.898
Oh my goodness.

13:39.276 --> 13:41.946
Where is that cassette tape right now?

13:53.332 --> 13:56.085
BROADCASTING ROOM

13:57.211 --> 13:58.963
What? You can't find it?

14:00.506 --> 14:01.966
I put it right here.

14:02.883 --> 14:04.343
Did Jae-young take it?

14:04.426 --> 14:05.844
Why would she take it?

14:06.637 --> 14:07.846
How would I know?

14:10.641 --> 14:13.310
Are you playing games with us?

14:13.394 --> 14:16.814
-Pardon?
-Don't enter the broadcasting room

14:16.897 --> 14:19.108
except in the morning
to air the broadcast. Got that?

14:19.191 --> 14:22.444
How could you tell such blatant lies
in front of the detectives?

14:22.528 --> 14:23.696
We're not lying.

14:23.779 --> 14:27.533
You never reported the cassette tape
to the school when you had it.

14:27.616 --> 14:30.035
You broke the school rules, you know.

14:30.119 --> 14:32.329
School rules?
Which one are you talking about?

14:32.413 --> 14:34.957
How do the school rules apply to this?

14:35.040 --> 14:36.250
Hey.

14:36.333 --> 14:38.502
-That's enough.
-I'm not making a fuss.

14:38.586 --> 14:40.212
And why aren't you saying anything?

14:40.296 --> 14:41.505
You were with us too.

14:42.798 --> 14:44.633
How dare you talk back like that? I'll--

14:44.717 --> 14:46.844
Let's not argue.

14:48.387 --> 14:51.181
Sir, how about we take a break
and have a smoke?

14:52.349 --> 14:53.517
Okay.

14:53.601 --> 14:56.020
I think they need to
sort things out there.

14:58.272 --> 14:59.899
Remember that security guard?

15:01.400 --> 15:05.029
Of course. They sometimes asked me
for bottled water to cook noodles with it.

15:05.112 --> 15:06.697
I remember that day.

15:06.780 --> 15:08.741
There were no exams that day,

15:08.824 --> 15:11.827
so only a few students involved in clubs
came to school.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.329
The school was quiet that day.

15:14.204 --> 15:17.082
I have entry logs of those
who entered the school. Take a look.

15:19.376 --> 15:20.419
What is this?

15:20.502 --> 15:21.587
What?

15:25.132 --> 15:26.050
That?

15:26.133 --> 15:28.802
What is it? You erased something.

15:28.886 --> 15:30.429
Well, you see…

15:30.512 --> 15:32.890
Nobody checks the entry logbook anyway.

15:33.515 --> 15:35.851
So sometimes I jot down reminders on it.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.853
But you know…

15:38.771 --> 15:40.606
I was wondering

15:40.689 --> 15:44.109
whether or not to tell you this…

15:44.193 --> 15:46.904
It kept bothering me.

15:46.987 --> 15:48.113
What was bothering you?

15:48.197 --> 15:50.658
When I saw the news about the girl,
I was so shocked.

15:50.741 --> 15:52.451
It made me sad.

15:52.534 --> 15:55.245
It was that girl.
The one that was reported missing

15:56.455 --> 15:57.665
on the news.

15:59.541 --> 16:02.044
-You're talking about Lee Kyung-jin?
-Yes.

16:03.128 --> 16:06.590
She came to school that day.

16:06.674 --> 16:09.885
What?
You're telling us you saw her that day?

16:12.221 --> 16:15.432
So the name you erased here.
It's Lee Kyung-jin, right?

16:15.516 --> 16:16.517
Yes.

16:17.309 --> 16:18.560
That's right.

16:18.644 --> 16:20.354
I wrote down her name

16:21.021 --> 16:23.315
but I erased it.

16:23.399 --> 16:25.442
Why did you erase it?

16:26.193 --> 16:27.611
Well, you see,

16:27.695 --> 16:29.113
she was acting weird that day.

16:29.697 --> 16:33.200
She hardly ever talked to me before.

16:33.283 --> 16:37.496
But that day, she said she had to see
her classroom and it wouldn't take long.

16:37.579 --> 16:39.581
And when she came back,

16:39.665 --> 16:43.085
she asked me
if I wrote down her name in the records.

16:43.168 --> 16:45.045
I told her I did.

16:45.129 --> 16:46.964
She then asked me to erase it.

16:47.047 --> 16:49.967
So I asked her why.

16:50.050 --> 16:53.762
After I said that,
she started to plead with me.

16:54.638 --> 16:55.723
She said

16:56.765 --> 16:58.559
her name couldn't be in the entry logs.

17:09.486 --> 17:11.697
I don't want people to know I came.

17:14.241 --> 17:17.786
And where I was today.

17:17.870 --> 17:19.288
All right.

17:19.955 --> 17:21.540
I won't ask you anything.

17:21.623 --> 17:23.625
I'll make an exception
and erase your name.

17:26.003 --> 17:26.962
See.

17:29.548 --> 17:31.008
Satisfied?

17:31.091 --> 17:32.301
Mister.

17:34.011 --> 17:35.846
My mom told me

17:37.848 --> 17:39.141
that my dad

17:40.350 --> 17:42.436
wasn't on a business trip to Japan.

17:43.520 --> 17:45.189
He was in Japan to be with his mistress.

17:47.316 --> 17:48.567
But whenever

17:49.735 --> 17:51.779
I got the top score on the exam,

17:53.030 --> 17:56.241
my dad would come to Korea
and treat me to pork ribs.

17:56.325 --> 17:57.409
Oh really?

17:58.660 --> 17:59.745
My mom told me

18:00.579 --> 18:02.956
that I had to get the top score
no matter what

18:04.083 --> 18:06.502
to have Dad come home often.

18:11.423 --> 18:12.841
I don't like

18:15.928 --> 18:17.221
pork ribs anymore.

18:18.806 --> 18:20.140
It's too sweet.

18:22.601 --> 18:24.937
All right. I see.

18:25.020 --> 18:27.523
Why don't you step inside
and have some green tea?

18:27.606 --> 18:28.941
It's warm inside.

18:29.608 --> 18:31.026
You'll catch a cold.

18:44.873 --> 18:46.583
Dry yourself.

18:48.961 --> 18:50.129
Mister.

18:51.213 --> 18:52.798
But you know what?

18:53.966 --> 18:56.009
That woman won't disappear.

18:56.718 --> 18:57.970
I can still see her.

18:58.762 --> 19:00.013
What? Woman?

19:00.639 --> 19:01.473
Who?

19:04.184 --> 19:05.811
I can see her out there.

19:06.770 --> 19:08.063
In the field.

19:14.278 --> 19:15.654
There's no one there.

19:18.699 --> 19:21.577
Mister, I didn't do it.

19:23.162 --> 19:24.121
It's…

19:26.373 --> 19:27.374
It's…

19:31.628 --> 19:33.130
It's her. She did it.

19:48.478 --> 19:49.813
What are your thoughts?

19:52.149 --> 19:53.192
About what?

19:56.361 --> 19:57.487
When Kyung-jin said

19:58.405 --> 20:00.365
it was the woman who did it,

20:00.449 --> 20:03.452
that must mean
she knows who the killer is.

20:06.121 --> 20:08.957
Yes, if what the guard said was all true.

20:09.541 --> 20:10.834
It also means that

20:11.501 --> 20:14.421
Kyung-jin could be an accomplice
in the murder of her mom.

20:20.802 --> 20:24.389
Sir, I'm not trying to argue or anything…

20:26.683 --> 20:30.020
But the killer stabbed her mom
eight times in the neck and face.

20:30.604 --> 20:32.189
We're talking about her mother.

20:32.856 --> 20:35.275
I don't think it's possible
for her to do that.

20:37.236 --> 20:38.487
Why is that important?

20:39.238 --> 20:40.155
What?

20:40.239 --> 20:43.158
Why is it important
whether or not it's possible?

20:44.159 --> 20:46.495
I'm not sure. Well…

20:47.246 --> 20:51.041
I don't want to believe that
the daughter was involved in the murder.

20:53.418 --> 20:55.170
-Really?
-Yes.

20:58.382 --> 20:59.508
What if

21:00.217 --> 21:04.012
there was a murder where a daughter
stabbed her mom in the neck eight times?

21:04.888 --> 21:08.058
If a murder you believed
could not happen were to happen,

21:09.309 --> 21:10.644
then does that solve your dilemma?

21:12.271 --> 21:15.190
Well, it's not like that.

21:15.941 --> 21:16.984
I mean,

21:18.819 --> 21:20.320
I don't want to imagine

21:21.154 --> 21:24.533
that such a normal girl could
murder her own mom like that.

21:25.242 --> 21:26.702
-For real?
-Yes.

21:29.288 --> 21:30.622
I think otherwise.

21:32.749 --> 21:36.420
There are murders like this
where the evidence speaks for itself.

21:37.379 --> 21:40.382
Gruesome scenes
that make you avert your eyes.

21:42.551 --> 21:45.345
But it's not our job to question
whether someone is capable

21:45.429 --> 21:46.972
of committing a brutal murder.

21:48.390 --> 21:52.602
What we do is like hovering over
a crime scene that already took place.

21:53.603 --> 21:55.105
What I'm telling you is that

21:55.188 --> 21:58.525
we don't need to analyze
the inner psyche of each suspect

21:58.608 --> 22:00.694
by peering into the deepest recesses

22:01.903 --> 22:04.239
of their mind.

22:10.287 --> 22:12.372
Even though we differ in our opinions,

22:12.456 --> 22:14.041
I think you and I

22:14.750 --> 22:17.002
still think along the same lines.

22:17.836 --> 22:18.837
You think so?

22:19.421 --> 22:20.339
Yes.

22:21.882 --> 22:23.633
Sure. You're right.

22:26.094 --> 22:27.345
Aren't I?

22:28.597 --> 22:30.807
-Or you could be wrong.
-What?

22:33.935 --> 22:35.062
What?

22:52.496 --> 22:54.664
This is the tense you have to follow.

22:54.748 --> 22:56.958
So the rest has to be past perfect.

22:57.042 --> 22:58.376
The answer is "had finished."

22:58.460 --> 23:00.045
What goes here then?

23:00.128 --> 23:01.546
The answer is "already."

23:02.172 --> 23:03.298
Sir, well…

23:05.509 --> 23:08.303
Could you ask them to wait in my office?

23:08.386 --> 23:10.472
-I'll be finished in five minutes.
-Okay, sir.

23:37.624 --> 23:39.209
Do you want me to watch the door?

24:04.484 --> 24:07.737
Whoa. He sure likes sweets.

24:10.240 --> 24:11.950
Would you like some candy?

24:23.503 --> 24:24.796
Hwan-gyu.

24:25.505 --> 24:26.631
Kim Hwan-gyu.

24:31.970 --> 24:35.056
My mom says you stopped going to
nightclubs every weekend.

24:35.140 --> 24:36.766
-Yes.
-Then what do you do?

24:37.767 --> 24:39.895
I'm going to church lately.

24:39.978 --> 24:42.939
Church? Really? Why, all of a sudden?

24:43.023 --> 24:44.983
Well, you know…

24:45.901 --> 24:48.403
The world doesn't seem real to me.

24:48.486 --> 24:51.114
So I feel like my existence is fake.

24:52.324 --> 24:53.408
I don't think life is real.

24:54.910 --> 24:56.286
You're talking nonsense again.

24:57.078 --> 25:00.081
Maybe it's because
I sniffed glue too much as a kid.

25:00.165 --> 25:02.500
Ever since then, I've had brain fog.

25:02.584 --> 25:04.002
So I do crazy things.

25:04.085 --> 25:05.754
You know about that.

25:05.837 --> 25:06.880
Because

25:07.631 --> 25:09.799
there's no real meaning in life.

25:10.550 --> 25:12.093
But there's something strange.

25:13.345 --> 25:14.554
The church…

25:15.096 --> 25:17.682
Well, it's not exactly a church.

25:17.766 --> 25:20.435
Anyway, ever since I started going there,
I've been feeling better.

25:20.518 --> 25:21.603
I see.

25:22.520 --> 25:23.897
It's a relief to hear that.

25:23.980 --> 25:26.858
Yes. It's thanks to you and your mom.

25:26.942 --> 25:29.110
No. You're walking down
the straight path now.

25:30.612 --> 25:31.655
Here.

25:32.989 --> 25:34.115
I have to go now.

25:34.199 --> 25:35.951
You give me homemade cooking.

25:36.534 --> 25:37.994
Would you like to come in?

25:38.078 --> 25:40.830
You came all the way here
to bring me this food.

25:41.414 --> 25:44.334
What's there to eat at your place?
You live by yourself.

25:44.417 --> 25:46.253
I have instant coffee packets.

25:46.336 --> 25:47.545
That's fine.

25:47.629 --> 25:50.340
Remember to thank my mom
after you eat it all.

25:50.423 --> 25:52.425
She likes it
when people compliment her food.

25:52.509 --> 25:54.177
Okay. Bye.

25:54.761 --> 25:55.887
Bye.

26:34.509 --> 26:35.719
MAY 8
KIMCHI

27:59.552 --> 28:00.720
What is that?

28:08.937 --> 28:10.605
I've seen it before.

28:23.034 --> 28:25.620
How strange. It's changed.

28:26.788 --> 28:28.415
How strange indeed. What…

28:28.498 --> 28:30.208
Where is he going? Why is he running?

28:32.919 --> 28:34.254
What is going on?

28:35.088 --> 28:37.924
Damn it. Miss, isn't that Lee Young-deok?

28:38.007 --> 28:41.553
-Yes, I told him you're waiting.
-Damn it.

28:45.348 --> 28:46.641
Lee Young-deok!

28:49.644 --> 28:50.729
Watch out.

28:56.484 --> 28:58.278
Are you okay? Are you?

28:58.361 --> 28:59.612
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

29:09.789 --> 29:10.957
Darn it!

29:11.040 --> 29:12.959
You crazy bastard!

29:13.042 --> 29:14.043
Mr. Lee!

29:15.170 --> 29:16.171
Open the door!

29:18.089 --> 29:19.382
I said open the door!

29:22.927 --> 29:24.512
Aren't you pushing it too far?

29:24.596 --> 29:27.640
The prosecutors will yell at us
for bringing him in that condition.

29:27.724 --> 29:29.350
We'll tell them we needed to question him.

29:30.226 --> 29:31.436
What did the doctor say?

29:32.353 --> 29:34.606
They're minor injuries. He'll be fine.

29:35.482 --> 29:37.400
Why did he back his car like that?

29:39.360 --> 29:40.653
He's hiding something.

29:41.404 --> 29:42.906
I don't know what it is yet.

29:42.989 --> 29:46.075
Look at that. Why is he eating so much?
Isn't that his seventh burger already?

29:46.159 --> 29:47.660
Will he be all right?

29:47.744 --> 29:48.870
Let's keep watching.

29:49.621 --> 29:51.623
We have a reason
for taking him into custody.

29:51.706 --> 29:54.501
-I don't want to release him right away.
-Do you have something on him?

30:08.097 --> 30:10.183
-Is it comfortable here?
-No.

30:10.850 --> 30:12.519
What do you mean it's not?

30:13.186 --> 30:14.479
What is this?

30:14.562 --> 30:16.940
Are you trying to break
a burger-eating record?

30:17.023 --> 30:19.067
I was getting nervous so…

30:19.150 --> 30:21.778
Why are you so nervous?

30:21.861 --> 30:24.781
We didn't cuff you
nor did we put you in jail.

30:24.864 --> 30:27.826
This place isn't jail.
That door is open, as you can see.

30:27.909 --> 30:32.288
You can leave whenever you please.
We just want to ask you a few questions.

30:34.249 --> 30:36.751
I made a big mistake earlier.

30:36.835 --> 30:39.212
Why did you do that?
Let's talk about it, okay?

30:41.381 --> 30:45.510
Detective Choi almost got
crushed to death by your car.

30:45.593 --> 30:47.011
Why did you do it?

30:47.971 --> 30:50.181
Well, you see…

30:51.015 --> 30:53.518
I suddenly got scared.

30:53.601 --> 30:57.063
I put my foot to the pedal
but I didn't know I was in reverse.

30:57.146 --> 31:00.400
-I'm so sorry.
-What were you scared of?

31:00.483 --> 31:01.568
Well…

31:02.318 --> 31:04.279
When you mentioned Lee Kyung-jin,

31:04.779 --> 31:06.865
I thought I was being framed
for her disappearance.

31:06.948 --> 31:09.284
Why would we frame you
if you didn't do anything?

31:10.785 --> 31:12.120
Well…

31:12.203 --> 31:15.248
There are people in prison
for crimes they didn't commit, you know.

31:15.331 --> 31:16.499
What did you just say?

31:17.709 --> 31:21.421
You've been running your academy
for over 14 years in that neighborhood.

31:22.714 --> 31:23.882
Yes, that's correct.

31:23.965 --> 31:26.593
You're very famous here
for sending 90 percent of the kids

31:26.676 --> 31:28.011
to top universities.

31:28.094 --> 31:30.930
Well, that's because

31:31.014 --> 31:33.016
I only accept high-achieving kids.

31:33.099 --> 31:34.809
But we heard another story.

31:34.893 --> 31:36.519
You sell a peculiar cassette tape.

31:38.396 --> 31:41.190
And you charge a lot for it.

31:41.274 --> 31:42.609
Is that true?

31:43.318 --> 31:44.444
How much do you sell it for?

31:46.321 --> 31:48.281
If it's okay with you,
let me listen to that tape too.

31:56.039 --> 31:58.499
Can I leave right now?

31:59.792 --> 32:01.920
-What?
-Without answering the question?

32:02.003 --> 32:04.339
Yes. I don't have anything to say.

32:05.256 --> 32:06.507
You said I had the right
to remain silent, right?

32:06.591 --> 32:08.843
-Fine then.
-What?

32:08.927 --> 32:11.721
-We can question you some other time.
-No.

32:12.221 --> 32:13.973
I don't have anything further to say.

32:14.057 --> 32:16.059
What is the meaning of this?
You brought me here.

32:16.142 --> 32:19.228
I wanted to give you my full cooperation

32:19.312 --> 32:22.106
because a student
in my academy committed suicide.

32:22.190 --> 32:24.275
But you keep talking about
stuff from the past.

32:24.359 --> 32:26.110
Wait a minute. What did you just say?

32:27.070 --> 32:29.656
-I wanted to give my full cooperation--
-No, before that.

32:33.326 --> 32:34.619
Suicide?

32:35.828 --> 32:37.455
Kyung-jin committed suicide?

32:39.791 --> 32:40.959
Yes.

32:41.876 --> 32:43.044
What I'm saying is,

32:43.836 --> 32:45.505
you all read the news, right?

32:45.588 --> 32:47.465
-So you must know about it.
-What are you talking about?

32:47.548 --> 32:50.885
No media outlet reported
that she committed suicide.

32:53.721 --> 32:55.390
That's…

32:55.473 --> 32:57.934
Mr. Lee Young-deok,
we never released a statement

32:58.017 --> 33:00.561
saying that Lee Kyung-jin
committed suicide.

33:10.321 --> 33:12.281
What the hell? What is this?

33:12.949 --> 33:15.201
Taek-jin, bring me a mop!

33:16.619 --> 33:19.372
Oh, that's disgusting.

33:28.464 --> 33:33.219
HANSUNG LIGHT CHURCH

33:56.659 --> 33:57.952
Excuse me.

33:58.995 --> 34:00.621
I came to see Pastor Woo.

34:00.705 --> 34:04.167
-Why would you like to see him?
-I talked to him over the phone.

34:04.250 --> 34:05.585
It's about Kim Hwan-gyu.

34:05.668 --> 34:07.920
Oh, Pastor Woo is giving a sermon.

34:08.004 --> 34:09.547
Could you wait there?

34:12.008 --> 34:15.344
To the brothers and sisters
who are here today.

34:16.137 --> 34:17.472
And your children

34:17.555 --> 34:20.558
are enrolled in a top high school.

34:21.225 --> 34:22.435
They're studying hard

34:22.977 --> 34:25.438
late into the night to reach their goals.

34:26.731 --> 34:28.149
But do you know this?

34:29.692 --> 34:32.653
Have you thought about which high schools

34:33.738 --> 34:36.074
stay open the longest every night?

34:36.949 --> 34:39.160
Do the students have the willpower

34:39.243 --> 34:41.913
to study ten more minutes
than the next student?

34:43.247 --> 34:46.417
Brother Joseph Choi,
who got into dental school

34:46.501 --> 34:50.338
at Hankuk University last year,

34:50.963 --> 34:52.256
said this to me.

34:52.799 --> 34:53.925
He said

34:54.550 --> 34:57.011
he studied until he nearly died.

34:58.096 --> 35:01.516
He even put a chamber pot in his room
to save time from using the bathroom.

35:01.599 --> 35:06.813
He coughed up blood due to his asthma,
but he said he kept studying despite it.

35:08.022 --> 35:11.359
He came to church regularly
and was a devout Christian.

35:11.442 --> 35:13.820
He was always read the bible

35:14.779 --> 35:17.406
and listened to the Lord's teachings.

35:19.158 --> 35:22.453
-When did Hwan-gyu stop coming to church?
-I'm not sure.

35:23.246 --> 35:25.456
He couldn't come to church
after the incident.

35:26.666 --> 35:28.626
What incident?

35:29.335 --> 35:31.254
You really don't know about the incident?

35:32.755 --> 35:33.965
No.

35:34.048 --> 35:37.093
We don't talk about our personal matters.

35:37.176 --> 35:39.887
It was on the day of the special prayer

35:40.555 --> 35:42.807
in memory of
the Saju station gas attack victims.

35:43.558 --> 35:45.810
You probably know that
our church holds a prayer

35:45.893 --> 35:48.146
in memory of the victims every year.

35:51.190 --> 35:52.233
Yes.

35:52.316 --> 35:54.318
In the middle of my sermon,

35:55.153 --> 35:57.155
Hwan-gyu suddenly stood up

35:57.238 --> 35:59.907
-We shouldn't forget!
<i>-and began yelling.</i>

35:59.991 --> 36:02.994
No. It's all fake! You're a con artist!

36:03.077 --> 36:05.371
<i>He called me a con artist,
saying it was all fake.</i>

36:05.454 --> 36:09.876
<i>I knew he had a violent side
but it was the first time I witnessed it.</i>

36:10.501 --> 36:14.881
<i>Before I knew it,
Hwan-gyu had stabbed himself.</i>

36:14.964 --> 36:17.049
<i>It was a deep knife wound.</i>

36:17.133 --> 36:19.719
<i>The floor was covered in blood.</i>

36:19.802 --> 36:21.012
When did this happen?

36:21.095 --> 36:23.639
More than a year ago.
Before you opened your restaurant.

36:23.723 --> 36:27.310
Do you remember anything that might
have made him do that?

36:28.603 --> 36:30.563
I don't remember every detail,

36:31.731 --> 36:33.566
but I was giving the same sermon

36:33.649 --> 36:35.860
I usually give for the memorial service.

36:37.778 --> 36:39.071
What kind of sermon?

36:39.572 --> 36:40.531
That we…

36:41.866 --> 36:45.328
shouldn't forget the innocent victims
from that attack.

36:47.246 --> 36:48.664
Neither should we forget

36:51.083 --> 36:52.960
the families of the victims, the attack,

36:54.128 --> 36:55.463
nor the perpetrator.

37:32.959 --> 37:36.087
SOOK CHINESE RESTAURANT

37:44.929 --> 37:46.055
Did you learn anything?

37:47.139 --> 37:48.307
No.

37:48.849 --> 37:49.934
Did anyone call?

37:50.017 --> 37:51.227
No.

37:52.228 --> 37:55.690
But I did get a call from the police.
They asked me if Jae-young called.

37:56.274 --> 37:58.359
They're not doing their jobs.

37:59.110 --> 38:00.820
This is killing me.

38:02.280 --> 38:03.864
Let's wait.

38:03.948 --> 38:07.076
Jae-young's friend came. She's inside.

38:07.827 --> 38:10.746
She's been waiting for you
for more than an hour.

38:24.510 --> 38:26.012
After you're done, you can go.

38:29.015 --> 38:30.599
-Get some rest.
-Okay.

38:32.852 --> 38:34.103
Ta-da.

38:42.695 --> 38:44.572
Thanks for coming here.

38:46.907 --> 38:48.826
Are you all right, Aunt?

38:48.909 --> 38:49.869
Me?

38:50.369 --> 38:52.496
I don't know if I am.

38:53.873 --> 38:54.874
I'm not sure.

38:55.541 --> 38:56.625
It's been a blur.

38:58.252 --> 39:00.755
But I need to stay strong.

39:02.590 --> 39:06.260
Did Jae-young call you or anything?

39:06.927 --> 39:08.346
No, she hasn't.

39:10.264 --> 39:12.850
-Did you have lunch?
-I'm not hungry. I'm okay.

39:12.933 --> 39:14.560
No, have lunch. I'll cook you something.

39:14.643 --> 39:16.145
Oh, I'm really not hungry.

39:20.649 --> 39:22.860
Aunt, the reason I came today

39:24.612 --> 39:26.197
is to tell you something.

39:27.656 --> 39:28.824
What is it?

39:29.909 --> 39:30.993
Well…

39:32.578 --> 39:35.915
Do you have anyone in mind
who might have done it?

39:38.209 --> 39:39.418
It's obvious.

39:40.461 --> 39:43.798
You know who gave
Jae-young a ride that day.

39:45.549 --> 39:46.592
Yes, I know that.

39:47.676 --> 39:51.138
But I don't think he acted alone.

39:53.933 --> 39:54.934
What do you mean?

39:57.061 --> 39:58.229
Moon-sook.

39:58.938 --> 40:01.190
Do you know something?

40:01.273 --> 40:03.401
Oh, I'm so conflicted.

40:04.235 --> 40:06.237
Jae-young said I shouldn't tell you.

40:09.073 --> 40:11.033
I won't tell anyone.
I'll keep it a secret.

40:11.659 --> 40:14.203
I don't know what it's about,
but hurry up and tell me.

40:16.205 --> 40:17.331
Well…

40:18.416 --> 40:21.710
When Jae-young and I started hanging out,

40:22.253 --> 40:25.506
she said I needed to know
something about her

40:26.173 --> 40:27.299
if we were going to become friends.

40:31.178 --> 40:32.805
She told me that

40:36.267 --> 40:37.685
her dad was Jo Kyung-ho.

40:43.149 --> 40:46.861
So I told her to shut up and stop lying.

40:46.944 --> 40:50.322
But she said it was true, and she was only

40:51.449 --> 40:52.908
telling me.

40:56.579 --> 40:57.830
And what else did she say?

41:04.920 --> 41:05.880
Moon-sook.

41:08.841 --> 41:10.634
Actually,

41:12.344 --> 41:14.597
she said her dad still contacts her.

41:16.390 --> 41:18.684
I'd like to ask you something personal.

41:20.102 --> 41:21.479
Why did you pick Saju?

41:22.730 --> 41:24.356
<i>It's your hometown, after all.</i>

41:25.816 --> 41:27.818
<i>I don't understand your question.</i>

41:27.902 --> 41:30.029
It's the place where your family lives.

41:31.030 --> 41:32.865
Didn't you have other choices?

41:33.949 --> 41:35.409
Is there a difference?

41:39.330 --> 41:40.664
He contacts her?

41:41.832 --> 41:43.125
From who again?

41:44.877 --> 41:46.295
Her dad

41:47.213 --> 41:48.923
still contacts her.

41:54.678 --> 41:56.847
But Moon-sook, that's impossible.

41:58.265 --> 41:59.642
You know that he's in prison.

42:00.851 --> 42:02.269
Jae-young's dad, I mean.

42:03.312 --> 42:04.438
Yes, I do.

42:05.064 --> 42:07.942
I didn't believe it, either.

42:08.484 --> 42:11.737
But I suddenly remembered
what she said yesterday.

42:15.741 --> 42:20.162
Actually, one of
your old high school friends

42:20.246 --> 42:23.749
gives her letters from her dad.

42:28.212 --> 42:29.588
A friend of mine?

42:29.672 --> 42:31.882
Which friend? For real?

42:31.966 --> 42:33.342
She really said that?

42:34.218 --> 42:35.219
Yes.

42:36.345 --> 42:37.763
She clearly said that.

42:44.937 --> 42:46.897
<i>So there's no difference</i>

42:46.981 --> 42:49.441
<i>between committing a terrorist attack
in your hometown</i>

42:50.568 --> 42:51.819
<i>and another city?</i>

42:53.696 --> 42:56.490
<i>Is there another reason
which you're not telling us?</i>

42:57.449 --> 43:00.202
Any experiences you had
in your childhood or…

43:00.869 --> 43:03.122
It's simply easier to conduct
an experiment there.

43:05.416 --> 43:06.500
An experiment?

43:07.668 --> 43:09.628
What kind of experiment?

43:15.801 --> 43:18.596
Nerve gas has already been used

43:18.679 --> 43:20.931
as a lethal weapon in many wars.

43:21.015 --> 43:24.935
So why on earth would you need to
carry out a gas experiment?

43:26.353 --> 43:27.771
You have no idea

43:28.647 --> 43:30.774
what I'm saying.

43:33.193 --> 43:36.530
I'm conducting a very complex experiment.

43:38.699 --> 43:40.993
It'll also take an unimaginable long time

43:42.369 --> 43:44.246
to conduct.

44:30.834 --> 44:31.960
Ms. Jung.

44:33.420 --> 44:34.838
You have a visitor.

45:29.893 --> 45:33.313
I made you a cocktail similar to
a traditional Tibetan drink.

45:34.314 --> 45:36.066
It tastes totally different from it,

45:36.150 --> 45:38.277
but it's not that bad. Drink it.

45:38.360 --> 45:39.987
You'll sleep well tonight.

45:49.830 --> 45:50.956
Do you work late a lot?

45:51.707 --> 45:53.459
I'm not the only one who works late.

45:53.542 --> 45:54.710
Everybody takes turns.

45:54.793 --> 45:57.671
This water treatment plant
supplies tap water.

45:57.754 --> 45:59.715
So we can't let any accidents happen here.

46:00.883 --> 46:03.135
-It must be tough.
-Not really.

46:05.220 --> 46:08.640
You look really tired.

46:11.643 --> 46:13.979
Do you need a favor or anything?

46:17.274 --> 46:19.651
Jung-hyun. Did something happen?

46:20.694 --> 46:21.862
No, I just came.

46:23.947 --> 46:25.073
Min-jae,

46:25.949 --> 46:28.410
what do you think about that bastard?

46:28.494 --> 46:29.786
Who are we talking about?

46:35.876 --> 46:37.044
Jo Kyung-ho.

46:40.130 --> 46:42.049
You mean, your brother?

46:44.051 --> 46:45.302
That bastard…

46:46.470 --> 46:48.180
He's dead to me.

46:49.264 --> 46:52.518
Ever since that day,
I don't consider him to be my brother.

46:54.520 --> 46:56.021
Other people

46:56.897 --> 47:00.067
probably don't know how much we hate him.

47:02.402 --> 47:03.362
Probably not.

47:03.445 --> 47:05.030
Even if they knew,

47:06.907 --> 47:08.492
they would think of him

47:10.577 --> 47:12.162
when they were to see us.

47:15.499 --> 47:17.251
Not all of them.

47:19.878 --> 47:20.879
Min-jae…

47:23.715 --> 47:26.552
Jae-young has been kidnapped
not long after we returned here.

47:28.220 --> 47:29.680
Do you think it's a coincidence?

47:30.347 --> 47:31.848
Jae-young's kidnapping, I mean.

47:31.932 --> 47:33.308
Jung-hyun…

47:37.479 --> 47:38.730
Maybe…

47:41.692 --> 47:43.652
we shouldn't have returned.

49:33.887 --> 49:37.849
<i>That's the end of
this brain enhancement session.</i>

49:38.892 --> 49:43.897
<i>Replay this during the remaining time</i>

49:43.980 --> 49:47.275
<i>to keep improving your concentration.</i>

49:48.318 --> 49:49.861
<i>Thank you.</i>

50:33.530 --> 50:36.950
Mr. Jo Kyung-ho,
I'll repeat the question.

50:37.033 --> 50:39.411
What kind of experiment is it?

50:42.914 --> 50:44.875
You're not going to answer that?

51:00.432 --> 51:01.600
Mr. Jo Kyung-ho.

51:02.392 --> 51:03.894
This is a good lighter.

51:08.648 --> 51:09.900
Don't you think so?

51:31.087 --> 51:32.714
So what do you think?

51:33.882 --> 51:36.092
-About what?
-Could it be a serial killer

51:36.176 --> 51:38.345
that we're dealing with?

51:39.554 --> 51:40.972
It could be.

51:47.062 --> 51:48.563
Are you feeling all right, sir?

51:57.531 --> 51:59.366
Have I told you about my late wife?

52:00.909 --> 52:03.078
No, you haven't.

52:04.746 --> 52:06.081
In 1987,

52:07.123 --> 52:09.042
during the gas attack at Saju Station,

52:10.919 --> 52:12.212
my wife was

52:14.297 --> 52:16.091
also there.

52:18.802 --> 52:20.887
We were separated at the time.

52:23.348 --> 52:26.768
But that happened
around a month after she came back home.

52:34.150 --> 52:35.944
The day before my wife died,

52:37.487 --> 52:40.282
I went to a bar for a drink.

52:41.658 --> 52:43.660
I don't even remember why I went, though.

52:44.202 --> 52:45.704
But somehow that's where I was.

52:47.163 --> 52:49.040
I left my wife at home alone.

52:51.293 --> 52:53.211
I was drinking that day.

52:54.796 --> 52:56.006
Every day…

52:57.215 --> 52:59.718
Every day, I tried to find
an excuse for why I did that.

53:01.219 --> 53:04.180
So I came home after drinking.
I was very drunk.

53:28.371 --> 53:29.873
<i>And nobody was home.</i>

53:30.957 --> 53:32.417
It was just me.

53:36.838 --> 53:38.465
-Shi-jung.
-Yes?

53:39.549 --> 53:41.426
I still think about that day.

53:42.052 --> 53:43.178
If only

53:44.512 --> 53:47.265
had I not gone drinking

53:47.349 --> 53:49.059
and had gone straight home,

53:50.560 --> 53:52.520
that might have changed things.

53:54.230 --> 53:55.398
Like,

53:56.983 --> 53:59.152
my wife might have not died.

54:04.366 --> 54:06.910
I got a phone call
at 10 a.m. the next morning.

54:08.161 --> 54:10.080
My instincts told me it was bad news.

54:11.373 --> 54:13.458
Even though I was still half-drunk,

54:15.085 --> 54:18.046
I felt like I shouldn't pick up the phone.
I had a bad feeling.

54:20.173 --> 54:22.092
When that phone kept ringing,

54:22.884 --> 54:25.345
each ring sent a shiver down my spine.

54:27.722 --> 54:31.267
I stared at the phone for a while
and then answered it at the last minute.

54:33.269 --> 54:34.980
Who was calling?

54:36.231 --> 54:37.315
The hospital.

54:39.401 --> 54:42.195
They called me right after
they were able to identify her.

54:43.321 --> 54:46.491
The nurse said my wife was
in critical condition due to a gas attack.

54:49.577 --> 54:51.162
I still don't understand.

54:52.747 --> 54:54.624
Why was my wife at the station?

54:57.877 --> 54:59.671
Where was she going?

55:03.383 --> 55:06.678
Anyway, that brief hospital call
changed my life.

55:06.761 --> 55:08.054
Ever since that day,

55:09.431 --> 55:12.559
my nerves get rattled
whenever I hear my phone ring.

55:16.062 --> 55:18.815
And when I got a call this morning,

55:21.651 --> 55:23.236
the ringtone sounded so ominous

55:24.946 --> 55:26.698
as if it were going to swallow me

55:28.992 --> 55:31.953
into a dark void. Just like that day.

55:36.166 --> 55:37.292
I have a feeling

55:38.418 --> 55:40.253
that we're involved

55:43.548 --> 55:45.550
in a case that won't

55:47.135 --> 55:49.345
be easy to crack.

55:59.230 --> 56:00.356
Where are you from?

56:00.940 --> 56:04.611
I'm Lee Shi-jung and he's Choi Hyung-in.
We're from the Gyeongnam Precinct's MIU.

56:04.694 --> 56:06.362
You can't go any farther
by car from this point.

56:06.446 --> 56:07.864
You'll have to walk.

56:07.947 --> 56:09.365
The road is too narrow.

56:09.449 --> 56:11.826
There was heavy rain last night.

56:11.910 --> 56:13.703
Sir, I think you'll have to walk.

56:13.787 --> 56:14.829
Okay.

56:18.041 --> 56:20.585
Listen to the part
where the director starts talking.

56:20.668 --> 56:22.295
Don't forget to turn up the volume.

56:59.457 --> 57:01.709
Oh, sorry. Did I wake you up?

57:01.793 --> 57:03.962
No, I need to go anyway.

57:04.045 --> 57:05.463
What time is it?

57:05.547 --> 57:07.590
I haven't slept well like this in days.

57:07.674 --> 57:09.843
You didn't sleep for that long, actually.

57:09.926 --> 57:12.971
I fixed some breakfast for us
in the break room. Let's go.

57:14.597 --> 57:16.015
What were you watching?

57:17.475 --> 57:20.145
You were asking me to show you
this photo album. Remember?

57:20.228 --> 57:22.772
So I kept it in my office
so that I could give it to you.

57:23.398 --> 57:26.901
Look at these pictures. We look

57:26.985 --> 57:28.236
so ugly.

57:37.537 --> 57:40.415
Not only do I look ugly,
but I also look so serious.

57:46.838 --> 57:48.047
Young-seob…

57:49.507 --> 57:52.177
Do you remember how he took this picture?

57:53.970 --> 57:56.473
He took it with the camera
he always had on him.

57:56.556 --> 57:59.517
He bragged about how expensive it was.

57:59.601 --> 58:01.269
Oh, that camera?

58:01.352 --> 58:03.146
He showed it off a lot
that it was made in Japan.

58:03.229 --> 58:06.357
-He would always mention the price.
-"It costs 100,000 yen."

58:06.441 --> 58:08.693
That's right. 100,000 yen.

58:08.776 --> 58:10.945
So that's one million won
if you convert it.

58:11.029 --> 58:13.239
I still remember that because
he constantly reminded everyone.

58:13.323 --> 58:16.201
All of those photos
were taken using his camera.

58:16.826 --> 58:17.869
Which photos?

58:18.870 --> 58:20.455
You don't remember?

58:20.538 --> 58:23.082
It was a game that was
hugely popular among the kids.

58:24.125 --> 58:27.295
We wrote an article about it
and it became a sensation.

58:27.378 --> 58:29.881
Kids from other schools bought
our school magazine to read that article.

58:29.964 --> 58:31.216
You don't remember?

58:31.299 --> 58:33.176
It was huge.

58:34.344 --> 58:35.470
What article?

59:02.539 --> 59:03.831
<i>Thank you.</i>

59:50.003 --> 59:51.796
No, please.

59:53.172 --> 59:55.008
No!

59:56.467 --> 59:57.969
I need to save my daughter!

59:59.178 --> 1:00:02.181
No, please. I need to save my daughter!

1:01:05.912 --> 1:01:06.996
It was this symbol.

1:01:08.039 --> 1:01:09.082
What?

1:01:10.124 --> 1:01:11.918
The thing I completely forgot about…

1:01:14.629 --> 1:01:16.130
was this.

1:03:04.155 --> 1:03:06.616
<i>This wasn't a simple homicide case
from the beginning.</i>

1:03:06.699 --> 1:03:08.701
We made a mistake from there.

1:03:08.785 --> 1:03:11.037
<i>What do you really want to know?</i>

1:03:11.120 --> 1:03:12.747
<i>Even if we saw it ten years ago,</i>

1:03:13.331 --> 1:03:15.583
how could we forget
what we saw in the video?

1:03:15.666 --> 1:03:17.794
There is something you forgot.

1:03:17.877 --> 1:03:19.086
<i>There is a woman</i>

1:03:20.046 --> 1:03:21.714
<i>in the upside-down place.</i>

1:03:24.008 --> 1:03:27.553
Is he the one behind all of this?

1:03:27.637 --> 1:03:29.514
<i>But you should have still told me!</i>

1:03:29.597 --> 1:03:31.891
You'll never be able to
go back to a normal life.
