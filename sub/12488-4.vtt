00:04.421 --> 00:06.423
- Hey, there.
It's looking good in here.

00:06.506 --> 00:07.632
- No! Go away!

00:07.716 --> 00:10.301
The football team isn't supposed
to see any of this yet.

00:10.385 --> 00:12.095
Rally Week doesn't
start until Monday.

00:12.178 --> 00:15.181
- I'm just so excited.
This is--

00:15.265 --> 00:19.269
This is my first year as
a giftee and not a giftor...

00:19.352 --> 00:21.604
- I totally get it.
But you've gotta go.

00:21.688 --> 00:24.983
- Okay, don't go overboard.

00:25.066 --> 00:28.445
But overboard's good, too.

00:28.528 --> 00:30.947
- Put on your lifejacket, baby,
'cause we're goin' overboard.

00:31.030 --> 00:34.200
I've been waiting for
this week all year.

00:34.284 --> 00:36.578
- I've been dreading
this week all year.

00:36.661 --> 00:39.873
- Come on, Buzzkill.

00:39.956 --> 00:41.666
Being a Rally Girl is great.

00:41.750 --> 00:42.917
We get to bring
the football players gifts,

00:43.001 --> 00:45.712
bake them brownies,
make them posters,

00:45.795 --> 00:46.963
and decorate their lockers.

00:47.046 --> 00:49.591
It's like being
a fairy godmother.

00:49.674 --> 00:51.426
- Or a slave.

00:51.509 --> 00:53.011
- Morning, girls.

00:53.094 --> 00:54.971
Everybody getting
ready for Rally Week?

00:55.054 --> 00:57.015
- CHEERLEADERS:
[cheering, applauding]

00:57.098 --> 00:58.600
- Can't wait.

00:58.683 --> 00:59.809
- Okay.

00:59.893 --> 01:02.437
Since I'm new here, let me see
if I've got this right.

01:02.520 --> 01:04.980
The football team's names have
been placed in this helmet.

01:05.063 --> 01:07.025
Whatever name you
draw will determine

01:07.108 --> 01:08.151
whose Rally Girl
you'll become.

01:08.234 --> 01:11.029
It's like Secret Santa
but with football players.

01:11.112 --> 01:13.281
Good that!

01:13.364 --> 01:15.825
- It's gonna be a long week.

01:15.909 --> 01:18.661
- I'm hoping so hard
I get Bella.

01:18.745 --> 01:20.288
I wished upon a star,

01:20.371 --> 01:22.332
threw a coin in a fountain,
and lit a candle.

01:22.415 --> 01:24.042
Actually, it was a bug
repellant candle.

01:24.125 --> 01:25.919
But that still
counts, right?

01:26.002 --> 01:28.213
- So, that's what
that smell is.

01:28.296 --> 01:29.464
- Remember, girls,
it's important

01:29.547 --> 01:32.509
to keep your identity secret
from the player you choose.

01:32.592 --> 01:34.427
- What happens if
you don't keep it a secret?

01:34.511 --> 01:37.222
- The person would,
uh, find out,

01:37.305 --> 01:40.809
which is, I don't know,
I'm new here.

01:40.892 --> 01:42.185
- Please, be Bella.

01:42.268 --> 01:45.688
Come on, Bella.
Come on, Bella.

01:45.772 --> 01:47.774
I got Bella!
I got Bella!

01:47.857 --> 01:49.359
The candle works!

01:49.442 --> 01:52.362
- I'm gonna light one
of those for Johnny Depp.

01:52.445 --> 01:54.280
- OMG, I know the perfect
gift to make her.

01:54.364 --> 01:56.866
But there's so much to do
and I need yarn and markers,

01:56.950 --> 01:59.661
knitting needles,
glitter glue.

01:59.744 --> 02:01.079
Lots of glitter glue.

02:01.162 --> 02:02.831
I wonder if they sell
it by the bucket?

02:02.914 --> 02:05.458
To the Yarn Barn!

02:05.542 --> 02:08.044
- She does know school's
in session, right?

- Thank you,
Tensley Davenport.

03:19.198 --> 03:20.950
- Oh, man, I wanted her.

03:21.034 --> 03:23.578
- Wait, how do you all
know it's from Tensley?

03:23.661 --> 03:24.454
It's supposed to
be a secret.

03:24.537 --> 03:26.414
- Oh, everybody knows
Tensley's father

03:26.497 --> 03:27.206
owns a video game company.

03:27.290 --> 03:29.459
So, each year,
some lucky player

03:29.542 --> 03:31.127
gets a whole bunch
of gaming gear.

03:31.210 --> 03:33.588
Today, that lucky
player is me.

03:33.671 --> 03:34.756
[sniffing]

03:34.839 --> 03:36.758
Gotta love that
new game smell.

03:36.841 --> 03:40.303
- Aw, look at what
we have here.

03:40.386 --> 03:42.305
A little stuffed bulldog.

03:42.388 --> 03:44.223
Ooh, a box of chocolates.

03:44.307 --> 03:46.976
Make that a heart-shaped
box of chocolates.

03:47.060 --> 03:49.979
And a "Dinner for Two"
certificate for the Starcade.

03:50.063 --> 03:51.648
This is sort of romantic.

03:51.731 --> 03:53.441
Do you guys think
it's from Sophie?

03:53.524 --> 03:54.233
- Nope.
- No way.

03:54.317 --> 03:57.320
- Not a chance.
- It could be.

03:57.403 --> 03:59.322
I mean, sometimes you
just can't fight fate.

03:59.405 --> 04:00.490
- Nope.
- No way.

04:00.573 --> 04:01.491
- Not a chance.

04:01.574 --> 04:03.284
- How do you know
it's not from Sophie?

04:03.368 --> 04:05.495
- 'Cause it's signed
"XO Vera."

04:05.578 --> 04:08.665
- Wait, Vera, from the left
hand bottom of the pyramid?

04:08.748 --> 04:11.334
Hey, not bad.

04:11.417 --> 04:14.212
- She's 32.

04:14.295 --> 04:16.005
- Well, that's sweet
of her and all,

04:16.089 --> 04:17.714
but my heart belongs
to Sophie.

04:17.798 --> 04:21.636
- Yeah? But, see, Vera
might actually like you.

04:21.719 --> 04:24.180
- Hey, maybe you should use
that Starcade gift certificate

04:24.263 --> 04:25.098
and ask her on a date.

04:25.181 --> 04:27.308
- Yeah, but Sophie
and I can--

04:27.392 --> 04:30.436
- Listen, Newt, you can't
get milk from barn wood.

04:30.520 --> 04:32.855
But you can make
juice from a turnip.

04:32.939 --> 04:34.190
- Preach.
- True that.

04:34.274 --> 04:38.361
- You guys are right.
I'll call Vera.

04:38.444 --> 04:40.196
- BELLA: Whoa!
Okay, check it out.

04:40.279 --> 04:45.201
Nail polish. My favorite
bath gel and...this?

04:45.284 --> 04:48.037
I'm not exactly sure
what it is.

04:48.121 --> 04:49.497
- It's an infinity scarf.

04:49.580 --> 04:52.333
- Hm, I've never
had one of these before.

04:59.132 --> 05:02.135
Yeah, I don't think I can
really pull this off.

05:04.929 --> 05:06.723
Wait. Okay. Seriously.
I don't--

05:06.806 --> 05:08.391
I don't think I can
pull this off!

05:08.474 --> 05:10.018
- Okay, here, hold still.

05:10.101 --> 05:11.227
- Okay.
[laughs]

05:11.310 --> 05:13.062
- No, no, no, no.
This way.

05:13.146 --> 05:14.856
There we go.

05:14.939 --> 05:16.524
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

05:16.607 --> 05:18.401
- Okay, it's been
long enough.

05:18.484 --> 05:20.987
Time to see what
my Rally Girl got me.

05:23.114 --> 05:24.407
There's nothing in here.

05:24.490 --> 05:26.075
- Maybe your Rally Girl
forgot you.

05:26.159 --> 05:27.577
- Forgot me?
Child, please.

05:27.660 --> 05:29.412
Look, whatever she got
must've been too big

05:29.495 --> 05:30.913
to fit in my locker.

05:30.997 --> 05:33.416
Ooh, I'ma go check
in the parking lot.

05:33.499 --> 05:34.459
Hee! Hee! Hee!

05:36.794 --> 05:38.296
Excuse me!

05:38.379 --> 05:38.963
- Oh, there you are.
We need to talk.

05:39.047 --> 05:40.923
- Okay, but make it fast.

05:41.007 --> 05:42.633
I've gotta find
my Rally Girl gift.

05:42.717 --> 05:44.761
- Troy, I'm your Rally Girl.

05:44.844 --> 05:48.222
- Oh, man!
Don't ruin the magic.

05:48.306 --> 05:50.349
- Sorry, but I've decided
to boycott the whole thing.

05:50.433 --> 05:51.934
Nothing personal.

05:52.018 --> 05:53.728
I just think it's
an outdated tradition

05:53.811 --> 05:55.605
that turns the cheerleaders
into the boys' servants.

05:55.688 --> 05:58.232
- So, there isn't anything
waiting for me

05:58.316 --> 05:59.984
in the parking lot?

06:00.068 --> 06:01.611
- No.

06:01.694 --> 06:03.446
- But what are the guys
gonna think?

06:03.529 --> 06:05.281
The Troy has to have
a Rally Girl.

06:05.364 --> 06:07.033
- Sorry. Maybe you could
just rally yourself.

06:07.116 --> 06:09.452
See ya.
- What?

06:09.535 --> 06:12.205
The Troy does not
self-rally!

06:12.288 --> 06:13.623
Oh, you told her.

06:13.706 --> 06:16.167
Yeah, I did.
Gimme some.

06:20.880 --> 06:23.591
- So, Vera, do you
like the pizza here?

06:23.674 --> 06:26.636
I think it's pretty good,
especially the--

06:26.719 --> 06:29.097
Is there something
on my face?

06:29.180 --> 06:30.306
- Yeah.

06:30.389 --> 06:34.185
Two big blue eyes
I'm getting lost in.

06:34.268 --> 06:35.394
- Oh, well, uh...

06:35.478 --> 06:37.146
if you're lost,
just follow the retinas

06:37.230 --> 06:39.315
straight out to the cornea
and make a left at the nose.

06:39.398 --> 06:40.983
- [laughing]

06:41.067 --> 06:43.986
Handsome and hilarious.

06:44.070 --> 06:45.488
- Thanks, I try.

06:45.571 --> 06:47.949
- It's working.

06:48.032 --> 06:50.827
- You know what?
Let's talk about you.

06:50.910 --> 06:54.997
- When I'm with you,
there is no "me"--

06:55.081 --> 06:57.625
only "us."

06:57.708 --> 07:00.336
- Oh, boy, would you
look at the time.

07:00.419 --> 07:02.130
- And look away
from your eyes?

07:02.213 --> 07:04.132
Never.

07:04.215 --> 07:06.467
- Uh...check, please.

07:09.595 --> 07:12.431
- Come on, Sophie.
You have to reconsider.

07:12.515 --> 07:14.517
I'm the only guy on the team
without a Rally Girl.

07:14.600 --> 07:15.434
- No.
- It's not that hard.

07:15.518 --> 07:17.937
I mean, how long did
this poster take--

07:18.020 --> 07:19.272
like half an hour?

07:19.355 --> 07:20.690
- More like half a day.

07:20.773 --> 07:22.024
You don't think
it looks good?

07:22.108 --> 07:23.818
You're right,
it needs more "oomph!"

07:23.901 --> 07:25.319
Why did I skimp
on the "oomph"?

07:25.403 --> 07:27.530
Back to the Yarn Barn!

07:27.613 --> 07:30.366
- Maybe you should follow her.

07:30.449 --> 07:32.201
Art supplies
are in Aisle 6.

07:32.285 --> 07:34.996
- Aisle 6?
But I ain't even try--

07:35.079 --> 07:37.790
To the Yarn Barn.

07:39.458 --> 07:41.335
- Ms. Fitz, every year
during Rally Week,

07:41.419 --> 07:43.254
the girls work super
hard for the boys

07:43.337 --> 07:44.088
and get nothing in return.

07:44.172 --> 07:46.382
I'd like to suggest that

07:46.465 --> 07:48.384
we get rid of Rally Girls
from now on.

07:48.467 --> 07:49.886
Can we do that?

07:49.969 --> 07:51.053
- Sure. Love
the initiative, Sophie.

07:51.137 --> 07:52.638
- Nice. That was easy.

07:52.722 --> 07:55.183
- Except I've only been working
here for two weeks.

07:55.266 --> 07:56.434
You'll need to take it up
with someone more in charge,

07:56.517 --> 07:59.770
like Coach, not fake
in charge like me.

07:59.854 --> 08:01.272
- Okay, I'll do that then.

08:01.355 --> 08:03.149
- Good and you tell him I said
you've got a real point.

08:03.232 --> 08:04.984
Although I'm not sure
he knows who I am.

08:05.067 --> 08:06.736
Yesterday, he called
me "Shirley."

08:06.819 --> 08:07.653
My name is Bernadette.

08:07.737 --> 08:09.739
But I can see how he
made that mistake.

08:09.822 --> 08:11.407
It kind of reminds
me of this time--

08:11.490 --> 08:13.284
Okay, I'll let you go.

08:15.077 --> 08:16.913
- Check out the poster
my Rally Girl made me.

08:16.996 --> 08:19.081
She really gave
it some "oomph!"

08:19.165 --> 08:21.584
- Check out the poster
my Rally Girl got me.

08:21.667 --> 08:23.252
It'll soon be
a collector's item--

08:23.336 --> 08:24.170
Face Eater 16.

08:24.253 --> 08:25.755
- BULLDOGS: Oooh...

08:25.838 --> 08:28.507
- Okay, I thought on poster day
we were supposed to get

08:28.591 --> 08:30.384
posters that were personal
and handmade.

08:30.468 --> 08:31.510
- Oh, yeah? I think
this is pretty personal.

08:31.594 --> 08:33.386
- MALE POSTER VOICE:
Come with me...

08:33.471 --> 08:35.972
- TENSLEY's VOICE:
...Sawyer.

08:36.057 --> 08:38.517
- ...to fight the face eaters...
- ...Sawyer.

08:38.601 --> 08:40.895
- And bring justice
to the galaxy...

08:40.977 --> 08:42.438
- ...Sawyer.

08:42.520 --> 08:44.273
- My mistake.

08:44.357 --> 08:46.442
Hey, how'd your date
with Vera go?

08:46.525 --> 08:47.610
- Well, she came
on pretty strong.

08:47.693 --> 08:49.612
But I told her I just
wanna be friends.

08:49.695 --> 08:51.739
I'm sure she got
the message.

08:54.992 --> 08:56.619
Maybe not.

08:58.037 --> 09:00.456
- The flying babies are
a nice touch, though.

09:00.539 --> 09:02.124
- Hey, guys!

09:02.208 --> 09:04.961
Oh, it's poster day?
Shoot, I almost forgot.

09:05.044 --> 09:07.588
I wonder what my RG
made for The Troy?

09:07.672 --> 09:09.799
Let's take a look.

09:09.882 --> 09:11.467
Well, well, well...

09:11.550 --> 09:15.221
What do we have here?

09:15.304 --> 09:19.809
- Okay, your Rally Girl really
needs to take some art classes.

09:19.892 --> 09:22.270
- Yeah, that must have taken
like ten minutes to make.

09:22.353 --> 09:23.354
- Maybe she made it on
the bus in the morning.

09:23.437 --> 09:25.648
- She did not do
it on the bus.

09:25.731 --> 09:28.192
It took her four hours
and twenty-eight minutes.

09:28.276 --> 09:31.153
I would...I would guess.

09:31.237 --> 09:33.447
- Hey, everyone, we haven't
done the rally gift swap yet.

09:33.531 --> 09:34.949
- Gift swap?

09:35.032 --> 09:36.742
- It's our own
Rally Week tradition.

09:36.826 --> 09:38.661
Each player gives up
their least favorite item

09:38.744 --> 09:40.496
so another player
can claim it.

09:40.579 --> 09:42.331
- Wait, y'all just
give up your gifts?

09:42.415 --> 09:44.166
- I know what you're gonna say

09:44.250 --> 09:46.168
about the sentimentality
and all, but it's--

09:46.252 --> 09:49.088
- Yay, goodbye weird scarf!

09:55.261 --> 09:56.178
Deodorant?

09:56.262 --> 09:58.514
- What? My Rally Girl got
me Mountain Breeze,

09:58.597 --> 10:00.016
but I'm clearly
Irish Meadow.

10:00.099 --> 10:01.559
I mean, look at me.

10:01.642 --> 10:03.769
- All right, let's see
who goes first.

10:07.565 --> 10:10.109
- Yay, I got number one.

10:10.192 --> 10:14.196
Man Crusher 7.
Sweet.

10:14.280 --> 10:16.365
- I'm next.

10:16.449 --> 10:19.035
- What the...?
- Dude, be cool.

10:19.118 --> 10:21.203
- My turn.

10:21.287 --> 10:23.789
Yum, come to mama.

10:23.873 --> 10:27.043
- Oh, man.
Oh, what else looks good?

10:27.126 --> 10:27.960
Hm...

10:28.044 --> 10:30.379
Oh!

10:30.463 --> 10:31.881
Uh, what?

10:31.964 --> 10:34.717
I always did wanna
try deodorant.

10:37.345 --> 10:39.388
- Cute nail color, Bells.

10:39.472 --> 10:41.307
Is that Jazz Berry Nice?
- Yes.

10:41.390 --> 10:43.559
- Thanks. It was a gift
from my Rally Girl.

10:43.642 --> 10:47.063
- Really? I had no idea.

10:47.146 --> 10:49.398
- Wait, are you
my Rally Girl, Pepper?

10:49.482 --> 10:51.901
- No, of course not.
Why would you even think that?

10:51.984 --> 10:54.570
Okay, yes, it's totally me.

10:54.653 --> 10:56.030
- This is so awesome.

10:56.113 --> 10:58.741
Thank you, Pepper.
I love all my stuff.

10:58.824 --> 11:00.576
That bubble bath
is my favorite.

11:00.659 --> 11:02.078
And that poster must've--
- And the scarf.

11:02.161 --> 11:04.080
What did you think
of the scarf?

11:04.163 --> 11:08.250
Tell me--how much did
you love that scarf?

11:08.334 --> 11:10.711
- Oh, yeah.

11:10.795 --> 11:12.588
So much.
- I knew it!

11:12.671 --> 11:14.590
Remember last month
at the mall

11:14.673 --> 11:16.425
when you pointed to
it on that mannequin?

11:16.509 --> 11:17.718
- I think I was actually

11:17.802 --> 11:19.220
pointing to the dress
on the mannequin.

11:19.303 --> 11:21.472
Anyway, you shouldn't have.
That store is so expensive.

11:21.555 --> 11:24.100
- Don't worry,
I didn't buy it.

11:24.183 --> 11:25.601
I made it.

11:25.684 --> 11:27.478
When I found out
I was your Rally Girl,

11:27.561 --> 11:29.271
I stayed up all
night knitting it.

11:29.355 --> 11:30.356
I poked myself a lot
with the needles,

11:30.439 --> 11:32.983
but it was worth it.

11:33.067 --> 11:34.568
See this?

11:34.652 --> 11:35.903
This is what love
looks like.

11:38.823 --> 11:41.700
- Oh, Pepper, you are
such a good friend.

11:41.784 --> 11:43.119
- No, you are.

11:43.202 --> 11:45.204
While I was making it,
I realized how perfect it is

11:45.287 --> 11:46.497
that it's called
an infinity scarf--

11:46.580 --> 11:49.125
because, like our
friendship,

11:49.208 --> 11:51.585
it'll go on forever.

11:51.669 --> 11:53.629
- Aww...

11:53.712 --> 11:56.799
So much thought was
put into this.

11:56.882 --> 11:58.968
- How about you wear it
to the pep rally tonight?

11:59.051 --> 12:02.555
You know, to show it off.
- Yes.

12:02.638 --> 12:05.975
Great idea.
- So, you'll wear it?

12:06.058 --> 12:07.852
- Totally.
- Awesome.

12:07.935 --> 12:09.895
- BELLA: [laughing]

12:19.280 --> 12:20.489
- Luis, have you seen Ricky?
- No, but if you see him,

12:20.573 --> 12:23.033
tell him I ate
his sandwich.

12:23.117 --> 12:23.993
- Will do.

12:24.076 --> 12:26.370
Vera, have you by any
chance seen Ricky?

12:26.454 --> 12:27.997
- No. Have you seen Newt?

12:28.080 --> 12:30.040
- No. But if I do, I'll tell him
you're looking for him.

12:30.124 --> 12:32.793
- Oh, he already knows that.
- Oh!

12:32.877 --> 12:34.670
- Hey, Bella. I heard you
were looking for Ricky.

12:34.753 --> 12:36.422
- Yes, do you know
where he is?

12:36.505 --> 12:38.132
- No.
- Yeah, me neither.

12:38.215 --> 12:39.967
Good luck.

12:41.677 --> 12:44.221
- Newt, have you
seen Ricky?

12:44.305 --> 12:46.682
- No. Have you seen Vera?
- Yeah, she's over there.

12:46.765 --> 12:48.184
- Good to know!

12:48.267 --> 12:50.603
- Oh...

12:50.686 --> 12:51.896
Ricky!

12:51.979 --> 12:53.189
I've been looking for you.

12:53.272 --> 12:55.733
- That's weird.
I was looking for my sandwich.

12:55.816 --> 12:56.275
- Luis ate it.

12:56.358 --> 12:59.403
- Case closed.

12:59.487 --> 13:00.946
- Okay, listen...

13:01.030 --> 13:03.032
remember that scarf that you
grabbed from the swap pile?

13:03.115 --> 13:06.869
- Remember it? It was
the find of a lifetime.

13:06.952 --> 13:08.954
- Uh, yes, um, unfortunately,
I need it back.

13:09.038 --> 13:10.956
- Sorry, I gave it to Abuela
for her birthday.

13:11.040 --> 13:12.291
- Oh, no. Okay,
I've gotta get it.

13:12.374 --> 13:14.585
Is she home now?

13:14.668 --> 13:16.128
- Yes, but good luck
getting it back.

13:16.212 --> 13:18.547
She really likes it.
- Okay, thanks.

13:18.631 --> 13:19.507
- [screams]
Sorry.

13:19.590 --> 13:21.550
I thought you were Vera.

13:21.634 --> 13:23.677
That girl cannot
take a hint.

13:23.761 --> 13:26.138
- Hey, you.
- [screams]

13:26.222 --> 13:28.098
- I really like
that shirt on you.

13:28.182 --> 13:30.184
- Thanks, uh...
- I like your gray one, too.

13:30.267 --> 13:31.769
- Thanks, but I--

13:31.852 --> 13:32.603
- And your red one with
the penguin on it.

13:32.686 --> 13:33.896
- Vera.
- And the plaid one

13:33.979 --> 13:36.607
with the little tiny hole
in the left pocket.

13:36.690 --> 13:37.942
- Vera, please.

13:38.025 --> 13:39.944
I told you I just
wanna be friends.

13:40.027 --> 13:43.113
- Sure. Okay.
Friends for now.

13:43.197 --> 13:45.908
But some day, we'll ride
that unicorn together.

13:47.826 --> 13:49.954
You can't fight fate.

13:50.037 --> 13:51.372
- You know, you should
hear yourself.

13:51.455 --> 13:53.749
You sound like, uh...

13:53.832 --> 13:55.125
you sound like...

number, right?

14:03.884 --> 14:05.761
- I do, but she
blocks my phone.

14:05.844 --> 14:08.806
I just love how
she plays hard to get.

14:08.889 --> 14:10.307
You look great
when you wear red,

and blue and magenta
and violet and sage

14:12.685 --> 14:14.019
and blue-green

Oh, no.

about women's rights.

14:30.369 --> 14:31.996
Have a seat.

14:32.079 --> 14:33.205

14:33.289 --> 14:34.290
But can you please
make this quick.

14:34.373 --> 14:36.625
It's my lunch hour
and I only have a little bit--

14:36.709 --> 14:38.669
- This is not gonna be quick.

14:38.752 --> 14:40.504
In 1866, Susan B. Anthony

14:40.588 --> 14:42.965
formed the American
Equal Rights Association.

14:46.510 --> 14:48.637
And then, in 2000,

14:48.721 --> 14:51.640
Destiny's Child released
"Independent Women: Part 1."

14:51.724 --> 14:52.683
an anthem of
female empowerment.

14:52.766 --> 14:55.477
- Sophie, what is
the point of this?

14:55.561 --> 14:56.812
- The point is we need to
abolish Rally Week.

14:56.895 --> 14:59.481
- Rally Week?
That's that this is about?

14:59.565 --> 15:01.775
I have no control over that.

15:01.859 --> 15:03.861
If you wanna change
school policy,

15:03.944 --> 15:07.114
you need to go ruin
the principal's lunch.

15:07.197 --> 15:08.824
- Wait. Seriously?
- Yes.

15:08.907 --> 15:10.034
And, by the way,

15:10.117 --> 15:12.911
you don't need to lecture me
on female empowerment.

15:12.995 --> 15:17.875
I've seen Destiny's Child
in concert 13 times.

15:17.958 --> 15:20.002

15:21.545 --> 15:23.714
- Joke's on you, Sophie.

15:23.797 --> 15:25.341
I self-rallied after all.

15:25.424 --> 15:27.676

I skipped lunch,

15:27.760 --> 15:29.219
read up on puff paint,

15:29.303 --> 15:31.180
and made so many visits
to the Yarn Barn,

15:31.263 --> 15:33.682
the gals there
know my name.

15:33.766 --> 15:37.978

check out my streamers.

15:41.607 --> 15:43.484
- You go, girl.

15:46.820 --> 15:48.614

- No time, mija.
I have to go.

15:57.498 --> 15:59.041
- Please, please,
this is important.

15:59.124 --> 16:00.834
You see, Ricky gave
you a scarf for your birthday.

16:00.918 --> 16:04.713
- Oh, yes, the infinity.
Very beautiful.

16:04.797 --> 16:06.882
- Actually, it belonged
to me first.

16:06.965 --> 16:08.425
My friend made it for me

16:08.509 --> 16:10.302
and I'm really sorry,
but I need it back

16:10.386 --> 16:12.096
so I don't hurt her feelings.

16:12.179 --> 16:13.722
- I'd like to help you,

16:13.806 --> 16:14.973
but I need to get to
my dance class.

16:15.057 --> 16:18.852
I am learning to salsa
for my date tonight.

16:18.936 --> 16:22.147
- Wait, how about
a private lesson?

My mom's a dance teacher.
I can salsa in my sleep.

16:25.651 --> 16:27.778

give me the scarf back.

16:31.323 --> 16:33.575
You've got some
moves, girl.

something all right.

17:13.906 --> 17:15.992
- Sophie, this situation
with Vera

She meant nothin' to me.

- You know what?

17:55.741 --> 17:58.035
I'm gonna leave you two
to sort this out.

17:58.118 --> 18:00.120

18:02.080 --> 18:04.500
Brilliant move, Sophie.
It worked. Thanks.

18:04.583 --> 18:06.502
- Don't mention it.

18:06.585 --> 18:08.670
- You were just making
that up, though, right?

18:08.754 --> 18:11.006
You're not really into me.

18:11.089 --> 18:12.549
- [slams locker]

18:12.633 --> 18:16.136
- Cool. Cool. Cool.
Just double-checkin'.

18:22.267 --> 18:24.603
- Bella! You wore it!

18:24.686 --> 18:27.523
It's all stretched out.

18:27.606 --> 18:32.110
- No, this is how
it's supposed to--

18:32.194 --> 18:34.613
Pepper, I am so sorry.

18:34.696 --> 18:36.698
See, there was this gift swap
and I gave it to Ricky

18:36.782 --> 18:39.576
who gave it to Abuela who
wore it as a skirt and...

18:39.660 --> 18:41.036
stretched it out.

18:41.119 --> 18:42.538
But I never would
have done it

18:42.621 --> 18:44.456
if I knew you made
it especially for me--

18:44.540 --> 18:45.707
working so hard,
staying up all night,

18:45.791 --> 18:48.627
poking your fingers and...

18:48.710 --> 18:50.045
Look at me, Pepper.

18:50.128 --> 18:53.632
This is what a bad
friend looks like.

18:53.715 --> 18:56.093
- Whoa.

18:56.176 --> 18:58.095
- I'm so sorry.

18:58.178 --> 18:59.596
You must be really
disappointed in me.

18:59.680 --> 19:02.099
- I kinda am.

19:02.182 --> 19:04.601
But not because
you swapped away the scarf.

19:04.685 --> 19:06.520
I'm disappointed because
you were afraid to tell me.

19:06.603 --> 19:08.021
- You're right.

19:08.105 --> 19:10.899
I don't know what
I was thinking.

19:10.983 --> 19:12.734
We're still friends?

19:12.818 --> 19:14.611
- For infinity.

19:14.695 --> 19:17.072
Bring it here.

19:17.155 --> 19:20.242
- Oh, Mr. Davis,
do you have a minute?

19:20.325 --> 19:21.910
In 1866, Susan B. Anthony

19:21.994 --> 19:24.246
formed the American...
- ...Equal Rights Association.

19:24.329 --> 19:25.914
I know. I taught history.

19:25.998 --> 19:28.625
Uh, can whatever this is wait?
I've gotta start the rally.

19:28.709 --> 19:31.003
- No. We women have been
waiting for 150 years.

19:31.086 --> 19:32.087
We need to get rid
of Rally Girls.

19:32.170 --> 19:34.756
We do everything for
the football team

19:34.840 --> 19:36.216
and get nothing in return.

19:36.300 --> 19:37.259
It's like we're
their servants.

19:37.342 --> 19:40.304
- I don't know. It is
a time-honored tradition.

19:40.387 --> 19:42.598
- Sophie, you were right.

19:42.681 --> 19:44.766
Being a Rally Girl
is the worst.

19:44.850 --> 19:46.518
Especially when you have
a mild allergy to glitter.

19:46.602 --> 19:49.021
[kicks banner]

19:49.104 --> 19:50.981
- But it's tradition, Troy.

19:51.064 --> 19:52.858
- Tradition,
my paper-cut hands!

19:52.941 --> 19:54.151
Look, the fact that you guys
put so much effort into this

19:54.234 --> 19:58.947
and get nothing in return
is just wrong.

19:59.031 --> 20:00.282
- Troy, are you crying?

20:00.365 --> 20:05.454
- No. I got glitter
all up in my eye.

20:05.537 --> 20:08.790
- You see, Mr. Davis,
even Troy thinks it's wrong.

20:08.874 --> 20:10.834
- And he is easily our
most selfish player.

20:10.918 --> 20:12.502
- That's what I'm saying.

20:12.586 --> 20:14.713
- You know, I think
I have a solution.

20:17.090 --> 20:18.508
Good evening, everyone.

20:18.592 --> 20:20.636
Let's give it up
for Rally Week!

20:20.719 --> 20:23.221
- STUDENTS:
[cheering, applauding]

20:27.726 --> 20:30.479
- All right, now before
we cheer on our Bulldogs,

20:30.562 --> 20:33.523
I would like to announce
a new tradition--

20:33.607 --> 20:35.859
Rally Boys!

20:35.943 --> 20:39.071
Starting Monday, the football
team will spend the week

20:39.154 --> 20:41.114
rallying the cheerleaders!

20:41.198 --> 20:44.993
- STUDENTS:
[cheering, applauding]

20:45.077 --> 20:46.203
- TROY: What?

20:46.286 --> 20:48.538
I cannot go through
this torture again.

20:48.622 --> 20:52.376
I have glitter in places that
should never be sparkly.

20:52.459 --> 20:54.211
- Hey, this is
a dream come true.

20:54.294 --> 20:56.046
Put on your
lifejackets, boys,

20:56.129 --> 20:58.048
'cause we're about
to go overboard.

20:58.131 --> 20:59.341
To the Yarn Barn!

21:01.593 --> 21:04.721
She does know we're right in the
middle of a pep rally, right?

21:04.805 --> 21:06.473
- I don't know.

21:12.771 --> 21:14.356
- Newt?
- Hey, Vera.

21:14.439 --> 21:18.193
I felt bad about keeping
these gifts after, uh...

21:18.276 --> 21:20.195
you know.
- Thanks.

21:20.278 --> 21:22.197
Actually, I could
totally use

21:22.280 --> 21:24.282
this gift card
for paddle boarding.

21:24.366 --> 21:26.827
I love spending
time on a lake.

21:26.910 --> 21:29.579
- I can't swim. Bye.

21:34.710 --> 21:36.545
- Hey, you dropped your...

21:36.628 --> 21:39.131
Oh, wow, paddle boarding?
- Do you paddle board?

21:39.214 --> 21:41.091
- I love spending time
on a lake.

21:41.174 --> 21:44.553
- BOTH: [sighing]
Nothing better.

21:44.636 --> 21:47.180
- We should paddle board
together some time.

21:47.264 --> 21:51.393
- Or ride a unicorn.
