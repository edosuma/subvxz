00:01.581 --> 00:03.477
The district attorney is
agreed to time served.

00:03.577 --> 00:05.094
So what do they want in return?

00:05.094 --> 00:05.908
Banishment.

00:06.008 --> 00:07.435
You want to talk predator and prey?

00:07.435 --> 00:08.841
'Cause you got both
under one roof...

00:08.941 --> 00:12.736
The DNA testing disputes that the
sole perpetrator was Daniel Holden.

[Groans]

00:14.598 --> 00:16.827
[Laughs] You're a psycho killer.

00:16.927 --> 00:18.075
You can't cry for our baby,

00:18.175 --> 00:19.978
but the first mention
of that that rapist,

00:19.978 --> 00:20.956
and here come the waterworks.

00:21.055 --> 00:22.576
I can't do this anymore.

00:22.676 --> 00:23.725
I'm leaving.

01:07.554 --> 01:09.426
Felt like a dream.

01:14.078 --> 01:15.892
What happened?

01:16.184 --> 01:18.237
You cried and...

01:18.939 --> 01:21.651
I held you, and you fell asleep.

01:23.580 --> 01:25.562
And here we are.

01:25.873 --> 01:28.172
Here we are.

01:29.470 --> 01:31.846
I don't want to go out there.

01:39.623 --> 01:43.459
You don't have to... Not yet.

01:43.493 --> 01:45.661
But eventually.

01:47.364 --> 01:49.298
Eventually.

01:55.205 --> 01:59.175
I used to dream about the morning sunlight.

02:01.478 --> 02:05.881
I'd run my hand through it in my dream.

02:07.684 --> 02:09.818
Like this.

02:09.853 --> 02:12.421
And now it's real.

02:12.455 --> 02:13.989
It is.

02:16.359 --> 02:19.528
I should be filled with joy.

03:02.172 --> 03:04.173
I'm leaving.

03:04.207 --> 03:06.008
Me too.

03:08.612 --> 03:11.180
Do you know where you're going?

03:13.850 --> 03:15.317
No.

03:15.352 --> 03:16.919
Do you?

03:18.355 --> 03:20.055
No.

03:58.128 --> 04:00.296
[Sighs]

04:11.975 --> 04:14.076
Tawney?

04:25.689 --> 04:27.790
[Birds chirping]

04:34.431 --> 04:36.432
Please call me when you get this.

04:36.466 --> 04:39.635
Got to let me know you're okay.

04:39.669 --> 04:42.538
Just leave a message, all right?
I won't answer.

04:45.775 --> 04:46.942
[Cellphone beeps]

04:51.214 --> 04:55.284
I just grabbed things
from the refrigerator,

04:55.318 --> 04:59.088
crying and... Dumping stuff in a bag...

04:59.122 --> 05:03.292
"I'll take one, I'll leave Teddy one.

05:03.326 --> 05:06.195
I'll take one, I'll leave Teddy one."

05:06.229 --> 05:10.632
My overriding thought was,
"I have to have food."

05:10.667 --> 05:12.835
That's not rational.

05:12.869 --> 05:14.603
[Chuckles, sniffles]

05:14.637 --> 05:16.205
Maybe it's <i> too</i> rational.

05:16.239 --> 05:18.607
Different people do different things

05:18.641 --> 05:20.209
under that kind of stress.

05:20.243 --> 05:22.044
I evidently hoard food.

05:22.078 --> 05:23.712
[Chuckles softly]

05:27.817 --> 05:31.020
I don't think we need the whipping cream

05:31.054 --> 05:32.454
at this picnic.

05:32.489 --> 05:34.556
Maybe on your corn chips?

05:34.591 --> 05:36.525
Well, I hadn't thought of that.

05:36.559 --> 05:38.494
Well...

05:38.528 --> 05:40.963
[Laughing]

05:40.997 --> 05:42.831
Let's see.

05:46.736 --> 05:48.003
Mmm.

05:48.038 --> 05:53.308
The salty, the sweet, the crunch...

05:53.343 --> 05:54.676
It's actually not bad.

05:54.711 --> 05:56.311
Really? No, it's bad.

05:56.346 --> 05:58.213
[Laughs]

06:04.354 --> 06:06.722
[Sighs]

06:06.756 --> 06:08.557
Uh, I was hungry.

06:08.591 --> 06:11.026
It's good for you to eat.

06:12.729 --> 06:14.363
I guess.

06:21.938 --> 06:23.472
May I?

06:25.608 --> 06:26.909
Thank you.

06:30.480 --> 06:33.782
I was so used to him... Being mad at me.

06:33.817 --> 06:39.288
I'd never seen him
so broken-down like that...

06:39.322 --> 06:40.556
So shattered.

06:44.394 --> 06:47.029
You can never come back here
if you sign those papers?

06:47.063 --> 06:49.064
No.

06:49.099 --> 06:51.433
Such a price to pay, Daniel.

06:53.436 --> 06:55.270
Not really.

07:05.281 --> 07:06.648
What is it, Daniel?

07:09.018 --> 07:11.987
Before you leave...

07:12.021 --> 07:14.723
Before you decide what your life may be,

07:14.757 --> 07:18.093
I need to tell you something, Tawney.

07:18.128 --> 07:20.796
It's about Teddy.

07:20.830 --> 07:22.931
What do you mean?

07:22.966 --> 07:27.002
He's been dealing with a lot lately...

07:27.036 --> 07:29.138
Things you don't know about.

07:31.174 --> 07:32.541
And... and you <i> do?</i>

07:33.877 --> 07:36.311
After the baptism,

07:36.346 --> 07:40.649
he told me to stay away from you.

07:42.352 --> 07:45.521
He was your husband,
and I know he was right.

07:45.555 --> 07:48.157
And I told him I would.

07:50.793 --> 07:52.961
Then he said some other things.

07:52.996 --> 07:55.864
What things?

07:55.899 --> 07:58.367
Just words... Lined up together.

07:58.401 --> 07:59.801
I've heard them before.

07:59.836 --> 08:03.305
Similar, anyway.

08:03.339 --> 08:06.375
They're just words, but he was afraid.

08:06.409 --> 08:08.744
He was afraid of losing you.

08:10.713 --> 08:13.682
But I couldn't see that then.

08:17.520 --> 08:22.024
I hurt him... Humiliated him.

08:23.326 --> 08:25.694
Something I learned in prison.

08:25.728 --> 08:30.599
Something to make a man feel... powerless.

08:33.236 --> 08:35.070
It wasn't rape.

08:37.039 --> 08:40.142
But it was violent.

08:40.176 --> 08:41.710
And...

08:41.744 --> 08:43.178
And what?

08:47.050 --> 08:49.585
Unhinged.

08:51.721 --> 08:53.922
I wish I could go back.

08:55.758 --> 08:59.361
Because he didn't deserve that.

08:59.395 --> 09:03.765
And he doesn't deserve
to have to live with it.

09:05.635 --> 09:07.803
He never said anything.

09:11.908 --> 09:14.276
I always thought it was me.

09:57.186 --> 09:58.320
Janet: Hey, Teddy.

09:59.689 --> 10:01.957
Hey, Mom.

10:01.991 --> 10:03.625
Just doing the books for the store.

10:03.660 --> 10:07.296
Well, we appreciate it.
I-I know that can be a pain.

10:07.330 --> 10:09.097
Not at all.

10:09.132 --> 10:10.666
Don't tell Ted, but I kind of
look forward to it.

10:10.700 --> 10:11.933
[Chuckles]

10:11.968 --> 10:14.303
So, what brings you here this morning?

10:16.339 --> 10:19.141
Uh, is Daniel around?

10:19.175 --> 10:21.310
Well, he didn't come in last night.

10:21.344 --> 10:22.644
I know, Teddy.

10:22.679 --> 10:24.980
It's just [Sighs] where he is right now,

10:25.014 --> 10:27.416
you know, in his life.

10:27.450 --> 10:29.951
He's like an adolescent in some ways.

10:29.986 --> 10:32.487
Just got to let him go through it, I guess.

10:32.522 --> 10:33.822
I guess.

10:33.856 --> 10:36.458
He... he might be at Amantha's by now.

10:36.492 --> 10:39.995
I think Jon had to talk over
a few things with him.

10:40.029 --> 10:41.930
So, is he gonna take the plea deal?

10:41.964 --> 10:43.298
I don't know, honey.

10:43.333 --> 10:45.667
I know he doesn't want to go back to jail.

10:45.702 --> 10:47.703
He's already talking about moving.

10:47.737 --> 10:49.271
Where?

10:49.305 --> 10:51.807
I'm not sure. Away from Paulie.

10:51.841 --> 10:54.776
It's all happening so quick.

10:54.811 --> 10:55.977
Teddy...

10:56.012 --> 10:57.779
What's happened to your hand?

10:57.814 --> 10:58.880
O-ohh.

10:58.915 --> 11:01.883
I, uh... I-I got distracted

11:01.918 --> 11:03.218
and got it caught in a door.

11:03.252 --> 11:04.519
[Chuckles] Aw.

11:04.554 --> 11:07.055
Oh, it's fine. It's fine. [Chuckles]

11:10.259 --> 11:13.028
Teddy, you okay?

11:13.062 --> 11:16.298
Yeah, I'm good.

11:16.332 --> 11:17.399
Teddy.

11:17.433 --> 11:19.701
It's me you're talking to.

11:24.273 --> 11:26.541
We lost the baby.

11:29.112 --> 11:31.813
Tawney miscarried.

11:31.848 --> 11:34.950
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry, sweetheart.

11:37.787 --> 11:41.223
The doctor said, uh, it's nature's way.

11:41.257 --> 11:43.392
You know?

11:43.426 --> 11:45.927
These things are pretty common.

11:45.962 --> 11:48.130
Happen more often than people think.

11:50.199 --> 11:52.167
That's true.

11:52.201 --> 11:54.770
But, still, that's sad.

11:56.773 --> 11:58.740
It is that.

11:58.775 --> 12:01.610
How's Tawney dealing with it?

12:01.644 --> 12:04.379
[Sighs]

12:04.414 --> 12:05.914
It's hard to tell, really.

12:07.450 --> 12:09.584
Of course.

12:09.619 --> 12:11.887
Things must be so complicated
for her right now.

12:16.626 --> 12:17.726
Come here, honey.

12:21.164 --> 12:23.131
You have my full support, now, Sondra.

12:23.166 --> 12:24.366
I want you to know that.

12:24.400 --> 12:25.867
That means a lot, senator.

12:25.902 --> 12:28.203
I wasn't sure Holden
would go for banishment.

12:28.237 --> 12:29.971
You must've been very persuasive.

12:30.006 --> 12:31.907
Well, he hasn't signed off on it yet.

12:33.276 --> 12:36.411
Did you threaten to revoke
his bond if he doesn't?

12:36.446 --> 12:37.746
I did.

12:37.780 --> 12:38.880
Would you?

12:38.915 --> 12:40.649
I would certainly consider it.

12:40.683 --> 12:43.151
[Chuckles] I see.

12:43.186 --> 12:45.720
And what Judge will sign off
on this plea deal?

12:45.755 --> 12:47.122
Judge Kelter.

12:47.156 --> 12:48.123
Uh-oh.

12:48.157 --> 12:49.891
Should I worry?

12:49.926 --> 12:53.562
Well, you should <i> always</i> worry,
Sondra, generally speaking,

12:53.596 --> 12:56.097
but especially with
the honorable Marcus Kelter.

12:56.132 --> 12:57.732
He'll need some hand-holding

12:57.767 --> 12:59.601
on certain aspects of this case...

12:59.635 --> 13:01.603
Why you dropped the rape charge, for one.

13:01.637 --> 13:03.138
No sperm, no witness.

13:03.172 --> 13:06.408
He'll still want details...
Specific details.

13:06.442 --> 13:07.676
Meaning?

13:07.710 --> 13:09.511
Have Holden debrief.

13:09.545 --> 13:12.848
Have him walk us through
the night of the murder...

13:12.882 --> 13:14.449
His latest version.

13:14.484 --> 13:16.184
I know what a debrief is.

13:16.219 --> 13:17.986
That way, when Kelter asks

13:18.020 --> 13:20.155
why you didn't charge Holden
with Hanna's rape,

13:20.189 --> 13:22.691
you can point to the transcript
where it says,

13:22.725 --> 13:24.593
"I killed her... I didn't rape her."

13:24.627 --> 13:26.161
<i>If</i> he says that.

13:26.195 --> 13:28.196
It would just be better
if he signs the confession.

13:28.231 --> 13:30.298
He better say it.

13:30.333 --> 13:32.033
What's the point of his plea

13:32.068 --> 13:34.603
if he's not willing to confess?

13:34.637 --> 13:36.438
Isn't that what this is all about?

13:36.472 --> 13:39.341
It's a little late in the game
to add demands, Roland...

13:39.375 --> 13:42.544
Especially a debrief.

13:42.578 --> 13:44.813
I want to hear it from the horse's mouth.

13:44.847 --> 13:46.882
I don't want there to be any talk

13:46.916 --> 13:50.018
that this was a-a plea deal
to save face on our side.

13:50.052 --> 13:51.386
Do <i> you?</i>

13:51.420 --> 13:52.621
Of course not.

13:52.655 --> 13:54.356
I-I just can't imagine

13:54.390 --> 13:56.958
that Mr. Stern would allow
his client to go through that.

13:56.993 --> 13:59.628
Through what?

13:59.662 --> 14:02.397
The humiliation of
having to answer for his actions

14:02.431 --> 14:03.665
once and for all?

14:03.699 --> 14:05.467
I can't imagine Judge Kelter

14:05.501 --> 14:08.003
signing off on a plea agreement
without one.

14:08.037 --> 14:11.206
In fact, I can guarantee you he won't.

14:11.240 --> 14:13.675
Get the debrief, Sondra,

14:13.709 --> 14:17.012
or all your good work
will likely be for naught.

14:33.863 --> 14:36.298
[Engine shuts off, ignition beeping]

14:48.644 --> 14:49.945
George.

15:00.556 --> 15:02.691
Hello! George!

15:02.725 --> 15:04.326
[Dog barking]

15:13.836 --> 15:15.937
Anybody home?

15:18.341 --> 15:20.008
George?

16:31.347 --> 16:32.681
[Camera clicks]

16:37.824 --> 16:40.459
Daniel, listen to me.

16:40.494 --> 16:43.630
Asking for the debrief affirms
what we already knew...

16:43.664 --> 16:46.132
They really have no idea
what happened that night.

16:46.166 --> 16:49.235
Now they're asking you
to fill in the blanks for them.

16:49.270 --> 16:51.838
Is it all right
if I just make something up?

16:51.872 --> 16:54.073
If they want to build a case against you,

16:54.108 --> 16:55.742
let them start from scratch.

16:55.776 --> 16:58.111
Scratch? I confessed.

16:58.145 --> 16:59.646
I'll get it thrown out.

16:59.680 --> 17:01.414
Will you really, Jon?

17:01.448 --> 17:04.150
This wouldn't be
like your first trial, Daniel,

17:04.184 --> 17:05.318
if it came to that.

17:05.352 --> 17:06.752
You would have resources

17:06.787 --> 17:08.820
your family didn't have back then.

17:08.856 --> 17:10.924
Justice row is all in.

17:10.958 --> 17:13.526
Look, even if they did revoke your bond,

17:13.560 --> 17:15.862
we would push for some sort
of electronic monitoring.

17:15.896 --> 17:17.997
You wouldn't be in custody
for more than a day or two.

17:18.031 --> 17:21.134
Then you could go home.

17:21.167 --> 17:23.102
So, who would be there?

17:23.137 --> 17:24.537
What?

17:40.721 --> 17:42.555

17:42.589 --> 17:46.392
It was my duty to communicate
their offer to you.

17:46.427 --> 17:49.128

tell you in the strongest terms

17:49.163 --> 17:51.597

I know we can win.

on the property.

All right, I'll figure it out. Thanks.

things at the grocery store,

We had a pretty good month.

19:35.803 --> 19:38.438

bit better than the last few.

I think he's even brought in
a few more tire customers.

19:55.689 --> 19:58.091
It's a win-win. [Chuckles]

19:58.125 --> 19:59.192

32:22.605 --> 32:26.208
I didn't want you to worry or wonder.

32:26.242 --> 32:28.710
I'm always gonna worry.

32:28.745 --> 32:31.680
What happened to your hand, Teddy?

32:33.750 --> 32:36.651
Got in a fight.

32:36.686 --> 32:38.353
Where you been sleeping?

32:39.956 --> 32:41.823
At a motel.

32:44.093 --> 32:47.896
Thought maybe you'd call Kate
or... somebody from church.

32:47.930 --> 32:52.167
I just needed to be alone.

32:52.201 --> 32:56.838
Probably <i> will</i> call her...
Or miss Kathy later.

32:56.873 --> 32:59.508
Just need to figure some things out first.

32:59.542 --> 33:02.110
Where you gonna do that?

33:02.145 --> 33:04.780
I don't know yet.

33:06.115 --> 33:08.016
Anything you need?

33:09.485 --> 33:11.520
I'm okay for now.

33:11.554 --> 33:14.256
If you get stuck...

33:14.290 --> 33:16.358
Or need help...

33:16.392 --> 33:18.059
You can always call me.

33:19.729 --> 33:23.365
Or call Mom and Dad
if you don't want to talk to me.

33:23.399 --> 33:24.900
They'd do anything for you.

33:29.005 --> 33:30.705
[Voice breaking] I know.

33:35.144 --> 33:37.712
Teddy, I...

33:37.747 --> 33:40.115
I don't know exactly
how to say this, but...

33:40.149 --> 33:42.517
I'm sorry.

33:42.552 --> 33:44.986
I'm so sorry...

33:45.021 --> 33:46.922
For what Daniel did to you.

33:50.827 --> 33:53.061
He told you?

33:58.201 --> 33:59.568
At the motel.

34:10.246 --> 34:12.914
I'm sorry you couldn't tell me.

34:12.949 --> 34:17.418
He's taken <i> everything.</i>

34:17.453 --> 34:19.654
Taken it all from me.

34:19.688 --> 34:22.690
[Paper crinkles]

34:22.725 --> 34:24.159
What is that?

34:24.193 --> 34:26.594
Doesn't matter now. [Chuckles]

34:26.629 --> 34:28.096
Is it for me?

34:28.130 --> 34:29.331
It's nothing.

34:29.364 --> 34:30.699
He had no right, Tawney.

34:31.766 --> 34:35.971
We were happy... Before he came back.

34:37.806 --> 34:39.908
We were happy, Tawney.

34:43.446 --> 34:45.146
Weren't we?

34:46.916 --> 34:48.949
I'm sorry, Teddy.

35:06.969 --> 35:09.371
[Door closes]

35:09.405 --> 35:12.240
[Knock on door]

35:14.277 --> 35:16.311
[Groans softly]

35:19.015 --> 35:20.115
Come in.

35:26.822 --> 35:29.424
You returned my Walkman.

35:31.093 --> 35:32.560
I listened to it.

35:32.595 --> 35:35.030
Of course you did.

35:36.465 --> 35:37.966
Did she love you?

35:40.536 --> 35:42.604
She was 16.

35:43.873 --> 35:45.407
Did you love her?

35:45.441 --> 35:47.943
I liked her.

35:57.320 --> 35:59.354
Are you gonna say you killed her today?

36:01.824 --> 36:03.325
Probably.

36:06.729 --> 36:09.497
Will I ever see you again
after you leave Paulie?

36:11.167 --> 36:13.168
Probably not.

36:13.202 --> 36:15.603
I didn't think so.

36:15.638 --> 36:19.674
Don't tell mother for a while, okay?

36:23.980 --> 36:26.147
[Sighs]

36:30.386 --> 36:32.554
Do you need my bike today?

36:32.588 --> 36:34.856
No.

36:34.890 --> 36:37.225
Thanks for letting me use it, though.

36:37.259 --> 36:40.962
I liked knowing you were riding it.

36:40.997 --> 36:44.399
It's a good bike.

36:47.069 --> 36:50.705
Well, uh...

36:50.740 --> 36:52.207
See ya.

36:58.280 --> 37:00.015
[Footsteps approach]

37:00.049 --> 37:01.483
No tie?

37:01.517 --> 37:02.650
[Sighs]

37:02.685 --> 37:04.319
Can you tie it for me?

37:04.353 --> 37:06.321
Oh.

37:06.355 --> 37:07.789
Of course.

37:10.526 --> 37:12.360
Amantha picked out this tie, didn't she?

37:12.395 --> 37:14.729
Yes, she did.

37:14.764 --> 37:17.565
I've been thinking.

37:17.600 --> 37:19.768
You might do well in a city...

37:19.802 --> 37:23.571
Somewhere where you might...
Blend in the soup, so to speak.

37:23.606 --> 37:26.408
You might be right.

37:26.442 --> 37:29.244
A lot of nice cities
just a few hours away...

37:29.278 --> 37:33.782
Chattanooga, Columbia,
Jacksonville, Birmingham.

37:33.816 --> 37:35.116
Alabama, mother?

37:35.151 --> 37:36.451
Well...

37:36.485 --> 37:37.719
Daniel, we should go.

37:48.097 --> 37:50.765
How about mobile?

37:50.800 --> 37:53.101
On the Gulf.

37:53.135 --> 37:54.736
It is.

37:56.505 --> 37:58.273
See you in a bit.

38:07.817 --> 38:10.185
[Door closes]

38:16.358 --> 38:19.094
Good afternoon. Afternoon.

38:20.696 --> 38:22.897
[Door closes]

38:22.932 --> 38:25.066
Did you both have a chance
to review the proffer letter?

38:25.101 --> 38:27.836
We did. Looks like it covers
everything we discussed.

38:27.870 --> 38:29.471
Once you sign this,

38:29.505 --> 38:32.107
nothing you say here
can ever be used against you.

38:32.141 --> 38:34.109
Do you want to have another look?

38:37.480 --> 38:39.147
"Truthful...

38:39.181 --> 38:42.350
"Complete...

38:42.384 --> 38:44.119

"...without evasion."

38:49.191 --> 38:50.225
[Pen clicks]

38:57.466 --> 38:59.267
You were down at the river with Hanna Dean.

38:59.301 --> 39:01.369
You'd both just taken
psychoactive mushrooms.

39:01.403 --> 39:03.838
What did you do then?

39:05.474 --> 39:07.375
We were making out.

39:07.409 --> 39:09.177
She took her shirt off.

39:09.211 --> 39:10.712
Did you have sexual relations?

39:10.746 --> 39:13.948
She wanted to, but, uh...

39:13.983 --> 39:16.818
I, uh... couldn't.

39:18.854 --> 39:20.522
Couldn't get an erection.

39:20.556 --> 39:23.625
She started... laughing.

39:23.659 --> 39:26.461
I got upset... Freaked out, I guess.

39:26.495 --> 39:27.795
She said it didn't matter,

39:27.830 --> 39:30.465
but she just kept laughing at me.

39:30.499 --> 39:31.966
I didn't like it, so...

39:32.001 --> 39:33.368
What happened?

39:33.402 --> 39:37.038
I was a coward, like my sister said.

39:37.072 --> 39:38.473
I ran away.

39:38.507 --> 39:40.241
So are you stating that you did not have

39:40.276 --> 39:43.311
sexual intercourse...
Consensual or otherwise?

39:43.345 --> 39:44.779
I am.

39:46.115 --> 39:49.384
Well, what happened after you left her?

39:49.418 --> 39:53.888
I got lost... I-in the woods.

39:53.923 --> 39:57.091
Kept getting turned around.

39:57.126 --> 40:00.495
I finally ended up on this...
On this bluff.

40:00.529 --> 40:04.065
It was just above the river,
and... I saw Hanna.

40:06.202 --> 40:08.169
She was down there where I'd left her.

40:08.204 --> 40:10.605
Was Hanna still alive
at this point, Daniel?

40:10.639 --> 40:11.906
Very.

40:11.941 --> 40:14.909
But now she's not alone.

40:14.944 --> 40:17.545
Now there were others...

40:17.580 --> 40:19.547
George, Trey.

40:19.582 --> 40:20.848
Who were the others?

40:20.883 --> 40:24.118
There was...

40:24.153 --> 40:25.720
Christopher.

40:25.754 --> 40:27.455
I don't remember.

40:27.489 --> 40:29.123
Christopher who?

40:29.158 --> 40:31.926
It was dark, but I could see their faces,

40:31.961 --> 40:34.862
their bodies all intertwined.

40:34.897 --> 40:37.432
Hanna was doing things to them...

40:40.603 --> 40:44.239
Touching and... grabbing...

40:44.273 --> 40:45.807
Sucking.

40:45.841 --> 40:47.609
And what did you do then, Mr. Holden?

40:50.112 --> 40:52.180
What did you do then?

40:53.616 --> 40:55.617
I just froze.

40:57.152 --> 40:58.953
Just stood there and watched.

40:58.988 --> 41:02.156
Then they saw me,

41:02.191 --> 41:07.395
and... and they watched me watch them.

41:07.429 --> 41:08.796
Trey saw me.

41:08.831 --> 41:10.498
He didn't care.

41:12.268 --> 41:14.269
They all just did what they wanted.

41:14.303 --> 41:16.504
Did what, Mr. Holden?

41:16.538 --> 41:18.806
I thought Hanna was...

41:18.841 --> 41:20.575
I thought she was trying

41:20.609 --> 41:24.512
to taunt me with them, you know?

41:24.546 --> 41:26.948
It's only later that I-I realized

41:26.982 --> 41:31.419
that she didn't know what she was doing.

41:31.453 --> 41:33.488
Got in too deep.

41:33.522 --> 41:35.189
She was 16.

41:39.028 --> 41:41.229
I had given her the mushrooms.

41:45.367 --> 41:48.002
I just turned away.

41:48.037 --> 41:50.171
What did you do then?

41:52.207 --> 41:55.610
I watched the trees falling.

41:55.644 --> 41:58.379
And then I went down there.

41:58.414 --> 42:00.181
And she was dead.

42:00.215 --> 42:01.983
That's it?

42:02.017 --> 42:03.685
Went down there, she was dead?

42:05.354 --> 42:07.789
She was all bent up.

42:07.823 --> 42:11.326
You see, it's the beauty
that hurts the most...

42:11.360 --> 42:12.794
Not the ugly.

42:12.828 --> 42:16.197
We didn't offer this deal
so we could sit here

42:16.231 --> 42:18.399
and listen to you spout lunacy

42:18.434 --> 42:22.270
and then lie about your role
in Hanna Dean's murder.

42:25.841 --> 42:27.175
Jon: What is this?

42:27.209 --> 42:28.876
I'm jogging his memory.

42:28.911 --> 42:30.645
Daniel, you don't have to put up
with any of this.

42:30.679 --> 42:32.747
No. No.

42:37.519 --> 42:41.656
That's the thing about memory...
It's malleable.

42:41.690 --> 42:46.327
It's elastic... Like time and promises.

42:46.362 --> 42:49.864
You've always been so helpful, Mr. Foulkes,

42:49.898 --> 42:52.700
getting me to remember, showing me these...

42:55.371 --> 42:57.004
Pictures... [Breathes shakily]

42:57.039 --> 43:01.442
And telling me how I must've strangled her.

43:01.477 --> 43:03.578
I never said that.

43:03.612 --> 43:05.713
Oh, I must've been...

43:05.748 --> 43:08.015
I must've been thinking
about the sheriff...

43:08.050 --> 43:09.884
The former sheriff...

43:09.918 --> 43:13.888
How he explained how she died
when the tape recorder was off.

43:13.922 --> 43:18.025
Told me how I had taken her clothes off

43:18.060 --> 43:19.961
and raped her.

43:22.097 --> 43:24.132
And all the while,

43:24.166 --> 43:26.534
me just sitting there waiting for my father

43:26.568 --> 43:30.071
because you promised me
that I would get to see him

43:30.105 --> 43:32.373
once I just gave you the truth.

43:32.408 --> 43:37.812
You promised me that I could go home.

43:37.846 --> 43:41.282
But I didn't go home.

43:41.316 --> 43:43.618
And I didn't rape her, did I?

43:46.622 --> 43:48.356
You were wrong.

43:50.993 --> 43:53.294
Are you at all surprised?

43:54.663 --> 43:57.265
Mr. Stern, I can't allow any more of this.

43:57.299 --> 44:00.134
If your client wants this plea,

44:00.169 --> 44:02.170
he's got to answer
these questions truthfully.

44:02.204 --> 44:03.771
Can you give us a minute, please?

44:03.806 --> 44:04.806
Please?

44:10.612 --> 44:13.114
[Door opens]

44:17.986 --> 44:21.088
Daniel, let's just walk away, buddy.

44:21.123 --> 44:23.024
Tell them we'll see them in court.

44:23.058 --> 44:25.660
She looked so beautiful dancing there.

44:27.129 --> 44:28.529
You're not thinking right.

44:28.564 --> 44:29.831
I <i> am,</i> Jon.

44:29.865 --> 44:31.933
Just go ahead and bring them back in.

44:31.967 --> 44:33.334
Daniel.

44:33.368 --> 44:35.736
Jon. Now.

44:46.370 --> 44:48.270
Foulkes: How did she die, Holden?

44:50.607 --> 44:53.709
I didn't want her to be u-uncovered,

44:53.744 --> 44:56.178
so I-I got some wildflowers,

44:56.213 --> 44:59.582
put them on her in her private places.

44:59.616 --> 45:00.783
I just...

45:04.621 --> 45:06.689
[Voice breaking]
Put her legs back together.

45:08.792 --> 45:13.162
And I-I placed Jacob's ladder in her hair.

45:13.196 --> 45:15.297
She wasn't laughing anymore.

45:18.402 --> 45:21.771
I don't even know why I got upset.

45:21.805 --> 45:24.340
She was so...

45:24.374 --> 45:26.042
So sad.

45:28.111 --> 45:31.047
So I sat with her...

45:31.081 --> 45:33.582
Till the sun came up.

45:33.617 --> 45:35.785
Then the sheriff came,

45:35.819 --> 45:39.121
and you... You were there in the room.

45:39.156 --> 45:43.592
And you asked me what happened.

45:43.627 --> 45:45.895
You said you didn't remember.

45:45.929 --> 45:50.066
Well, a-at first, I-I didn't, but...

45:50.100 --> 45:54.321
Then y-you kept showing me these pictures

45:54.321 --> 45:55.705
trying to explain,

45:55.739 --> 45:57.907
but it still didn't make any sense.

45:57.941 --> 45:59.742
But I was numb.

45:59.776 --> 46:04.280
I-I'd been in that room... For hours.

46:04.314 --> 46:07.583
So I just said what I...

46:07.617 --> 46:10.619
I needed to say...

46:10.654 --> 46:14.690
To get out... To see my father.

46:17.828 --> 46:20.930
And you let me say it.

46:20.964 --> 46:22.431
You let me.

46:24.434 --> 46:27.737
I let you say
what you <i> wanted</i> to say, Daniel.

46:27.771 --> 46:32.241
I let you unburden yourself.

46:32.275 --> 46:34.477
Maybe the details were foggy,

46:34.511 --> 46:37.613
but the truth was as clear as day.

46:37.647 --> 46:40.483
It remains so.

46:40.517 --> 46:42.618
You said I could go home.

46:42.652 --> 46:44.854
Did you kill Hanna Dean?

46:44.888 --> 46:50.092
If I say I did,
will you let me go this time?

46:50.127 --> 46:52.928
No one made you kill her, did they?

46:52.963 --> 46:56.465
If I say I did, will you let me go?

46:56.500 --> 47:02.338
Tell me... no one
made you kill her, did they?

47:19.055 --> 47:21.290
No.

47:21.324 --> 47:22.925
They didn't.

47:24.561 --> 47:26.896
How did she die, Daniel?

47:30.534 --> 47:32.101
Daniel.

47:39.576 --> 47:43.879
I-I just put my hands around her neck...

47:43.914 --> 47:47.550
Squeezed as hard as I could.

47:47.584 --> 47:49.785
Until what?

47:52.389 --> 47:55.224
Until she was gone.

48:00.130 --> 48:02.665
I killed her.

48:02.699 --> 48:05.501
And no one put words in your mouth.

48:05.535 --> 48:10.606
No one coerced your confession.

48:10.640 --> 48:11.974
Did they?

48:19.749 --> 48:20.883
No.

48:23.320 --> 48:25.120
They didn't.

48:33.163 --> 48:35.030
Are we done?

48:35.065 --> 48:37.633
[Sighs]

48:37.667 --> 48:39.001
We're done.

48:55.282 --> 48:57.082
What just happened in there, Daniel?

48:57.117 --> 48:58.851
Memories.

49:03.957 --> 49:06.091
[Sighs] You should sit.

49:06.126 --> 49:08.927
It might be a while before we
present the plea to the judge.

49:08.962 --> 49:11.664
I've been sitting for hours.

49:12.766 --> 49:14.133
Not a problem.

49:32.952 --> 49:36.355
[Classical music plays]

50:50.263 --> 50:53.265
Ted: We got a nice set of tires.

50:53.299 --> 50:55.267
We can... we can get all kinds of rims.

50:55.301 --> 50:57.569
The kids, they tend to go for the spinners.

50:57.604 --> 50:59.238
Uh, but this one might be...

52:01.701 --> 52:04.636
Do you know anyone in mobile?

52:04.671 --> 52:06.238
I don't.

52:06.272 --> 52:11.043
You might say
that's one of its attractions.

52:23.890 --> 52:26.325
[Door closes]

52:36.469 --> 52:38.537
[Breathes shakily]

52:38.571 --> 52:39.872
So, how'd it go?

52:39.906 --> 52:43.509
He said he killed her but didn't rape her.

52:45.311 --> 52:48.146
Well, did he say why he killed her?

52:48.181 --> 52:50.549
I need you to run up to Atlanta.

52:50.583 --> 52:54.820
Run these to the lab.
Have them do DNA testing.

52:54.854 --> 52:56.021
To each other?

52:56.055 --> 52:57.756
Or to Hanna Dean.

52:59.092 --> 53:00.792
Trey Willis?

53:00.827 --> 53:02.794
Son of a bitch licked it.

53:02.829 --> 53:03.896
[Knock on door]

53:03.930 --> 53:06.765
Is it too late?

53:10.203 --> 53:11.537
Carl?

53:11.571 --> 53:12.938
Is it too late?

53:16.075 --> 53:17.876
I don't know.

53:17.911 --> 53:19.912
I'll make a call.

53:19.946 --> 53:21.747
[Dialing]

53:26.619 --> 53:27.886
[Cellphone buzzes]

53:27.921 --> 53:30.389
Excuse me. Let me take this.

53:30.423 --> 53:31.924
Yes, sir?

53:37.597 --> 53:40.032
Better go see what's taking them so long.

53:45.972 --> 53:48.540
Owen, come on.

53:48.575 --> 53:50.943
What's wrong?

53:59.052 --> 54:00.285
Take it.

54:00.320 --> 54:01.520
Uh, no, I...

54:01.554 --> 54:02.588
Take anything you want.

54:03.590 --> 54:06.358
Take it all.

54:06.392 --> 54:08.427
You'll be doing us a favor.
