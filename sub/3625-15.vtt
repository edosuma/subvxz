[Gossip Girl]
Gossip Girl here,
your one and only source

00:03.960 --> 00:05.701
into the scandalous lives
of Manhattan's elite.

00:05.788 --> 00:08.269
I got three cases of champagne
for Serena van der Woodsen.

00:08.356 --> 00:10.140
- For me?
- Who's it from?

00:10.227 --> 00:11.446
[Serena]
'Porn and handcuffs?'

00:11.533 --> 00:13.100
This is low, Chuck.
Even for you.

00:13.187 --> 00:14.840
- What's this?
- Chuck said, it came for you.

00:14.927 --> 00:16.712
Whoa. Is that coke?

00:16.799 --> 00:18.757
How do you like a brother
who uses you as a drug mule?

00:18.844 --> 00:20.933
I can't believe you think
Chuck is doing these things.

00:21.021 --> 00:22.587
- What's he done now?
- I'll tell you what he's done.

00:22.674 --> 00:24.024
If we're gonna exist
under the same roof

00:24.111 --> 00:25.764
I am laying down
some house rules.

00:25.851 --> 00:27.897
No need, princess.
Bart already kicked me out.

00:27.984 --> 00:29.290
I'm moving back to my suite.

00:29.377 --> 00:30.595
I love you, Nate Archibald.

00:30.682 --> 00:32.423
Always have, always will.

00:32.510 --> 00:34.686
I want nothing else to do
with you, Blair. It's over.

00:34.773 --> 00:37.820
Jenny, if you walk away
from me now, I will ruin you.

00:37.907 --> 00:39.126
How are you gonna do that?

00:39.213 --> 00:40.649
My mother's Valentino
was stolen.

00:40.736 --> 00:42.390
Oh, my God.
That's my mother's dress.

00:42.477 --> 00:44.392
Do you think that you can
just send me off to school

00:44.479 --> 00:45.871
with a plaid skirt
and a MetroCard

00:45.958 --> 00:47.569
and everything will be okay?

00:47.656 --> 00:49.092
I'm really sorry, Chuck.

00:49.179 --> 00:51.051
I know it wasn't you
who sent me that stuff.

00:56.317 --> 00:57.405
Where's she been, Serena?

00:57.492 --> 00:58.841
[Gossip Girl]
And who am I?

00:58.928 --> 01:00.364
That's a secret
I'll never tell.

01:01.713 --> 01:03.280
You know you love me.

01:03.367 --> 01:05.500
XOXO.

01:05.587 --> 01:07.763
Gossip Girl.

01:07.850 --> 01:09.939
There are three things
we do alone.

01:10.026 --> 01:11.984
We are born, we die

01:12.072 --> 01:14.813
and if we're a high school
junior headed for college

01:14.900 --> 01:16.946
we take the SATs.

01:17.033 --> 01:19.992
And while the test is said
to measure our best traits

01:20.080 --> 01:24.040
preparing for it inevitably
brings out the worst.

01:24.127 --> 01:26.477

Ugh! Dad, don't ever

02:26.842 --> 02:28.583
Just doing what I was told.
Time's up.

02:28.670 --> 02:30.062
I was instructed
that whenever time was up

02:30.150 --> 02:31.499
I should share that information.

02:31.586 --> 02:33.240
Yes, but the manner in
which you went about it-it

02:33.327 --> 02:34.850
was like you were deliberately
trying to humiliate me.

02:34.937 --> 02:35.981
How bad?

02:36.068 --> 02:37.766
Uh...half.

02:37.853 --> 02:40.682
I finished exactly half
in the allotted time.

02:40.769 --> 02:42.771
- Well, you're a smart kid.
- I'm a choker. I choke.

02:42.858 --> 02:44.860
- Hmm, just in your head.
- Tee-ball. First grade.

02:44.947 --> 02:47.558
Remember this?
Bases loaded, and I struck out.

02:47.645 --> 02:49.343
- You were six.
- The ball was on a tee.

02:49.430 --> 02:50.866
- Not moving.
- You'll come through.

02:50.953 --> 02:53.695
You're basing that
on what, exactly?

02:53.782 --> 02:55.523
Blind faith?

02:55.610 --> 02:57.916
- Bye.
- Wait.

02:58.003 --> 02:59.614
- Dad, I'm gonna be late.
- I'm coming with you.

02:59.701 --> 03:01.398
What? You're walking me
to school?

03:01.485 --> 03:02.921
- I need the exercise.
- I made one mistake.

03:03.008 --> 03:04.619
It doesn't mean I need
a human ankle monitor.

03:04.706 --> 03:06.055
You used to beg me
to walk you to school.

03:06.142 --> 03:07.448
You'd cry if I didn't
walk you to class.

03:07.535 --> 03:09.319
- That wasn't me. That was Dan.
- 'It's true.'

03:09.406 --> 03:10.929
But I was six and it was
an emotional time for me.

03:11.016 --> 03:12.366
It was post Tee-ball.

03:12.453 --> 03:13.715
Jenny, what you did was wrong

03:13.802 --> 03:15.238
and really out of character.

03:15.325 --> 03:16.761
Grounding you
is not just about punishment.

03:16.848 --> 03:18.633
We need to spend some time
together, reconnect.

03:18.720 --> 03:20.417
Yeah, I want that, too.

03:20.504 --> 03:24.378
Just...not in public
and in front of my friends.

03:24.465 --> 03:27.207
[sighs]
Alright. Tonight. Dinner.

03:27.294 --> 03:31.036
Okay, but, I have
group rehearsal. I'm the alto.

03:31.123 --> 03:32.603
And I'm really proud,
but we are connecting

03:32.690 --> 03:34.388
this evening over lasagna.

03:34.475 --> 03:35.476
[Dan]
'Hey, Jen, you wanna
wait up for a second?'

03:35.563 --> 03:37.129
We could take the..

03:37.217 --> 03:38.827
Well, a-alright,
I'll see you at school.

03:44.180 --> 03:47.314
- Twenty-two hundred. Fair.
- It's 90th percentile.

03:47.401 --> 03:50.142
Which means Nelly Yuki
probably got 2300.

03:50.230 --> 03:52.928
You don't even talk to her.
Why do you care how she does?

03:53.015 --> 03:55.278
Nelly Yuki has her sights
set on Yale, too.

03:55.365 --> 03:56.366
What're the odds
of them accepting

03:56.453 --> 03:58.020
two girls from Constance?

03:58.107 --> 04:00.327
And have you seen Nelly Yuki's
extra-curriculars?

04:00.414 --> 04:01.937
I need to kick
her well-rounded ass.

04:02.024 --> 04:03.547
And they say
you've lost your edge.

04:03.634 --> 04:05.375
Nelly Yuki must be destroyed.

04:05.462 --> 04:06.463
Why do you
keep saying her name?

04:06.550 --> 04:07.725
Because it's Nelly Yuki.

04:07.812 --> 04:09.466
[chuckles]

04:09.553 --> 04:11.599
Eww, gross. Incoming. Chuck.
You ready?

04:11.686 --> 04:13.340
No, I gotta wait for Dan.
He's pretty stressed.

04:13.427 --> 04:14.906
He doesn't do well
with tests, so..

04:14.993 --> 04:16.995
- Performance anxiety?
- Bye, Blair.

04:23.567 --> 04:25.656
She really needs to tone down
on the social niceties.

04:25.743 --> 04:26.701
It's embarrassing.

04:26.788 --> 04:27.919
Eventually, the two of you

04:28.006 --> 04:29.704
are gonna have
to work out your issues.

04:29.791 --> 04:31.532
What issues? I'm issue-free.

04:31.619 --> 04:35.275
And, uh, based on my exhaustive
research, so are you.

04:36.319 --> 04:37.625
Georgina?

04:37.712 --> 04:39.322
According to my
very reliable sources

04:39.409 --> 04:41.411
Georgina Sparks
is nowhere near our Fair Isle.

04:41.498 --> 04:44.980
She's in Switzerland,
dating the Prince of Belfort.

04:45.067 --> 04:46.764
- There's a Prince of Belfort?
- Uh-huh.

04:46.851 --> 04:49.593
And she's dating him?
Oh, thank God.

04:49.680 --> 04:51.769
Now you can enjoy
the gifts she mailed you

04:51.856 --> 04:54.337
with peace of mind
and maybe Chuck in the room.

04:54.424 --> 04:56.905
Oh, shoot.
Except we're siblings.

04:56.992 --> 04:59.560
Georgie always brought out
the devil in you.

04:59.647 --> 05:01.344
Part of me is a little
disappointed she's not here.

05:01.431 --> 05:03.041
Hmm, I wonder which part.

05:03.128 --> 05:04.521
It's been a while since
I saw the old Serena.

05:04.608 --> 05:06.001
Well, thanks to her
the new one has to break

05:06.088 --> 05:07.481
2000 on her SATs.

05:07.568 --> 05:09.265
So if you could just
go smarm elsewhere..

05:09.352 --> 05:10.571
The offer still stands.

05:10.658 --> 05:12.703
I know, a, uh, lovely little
redhead

05:12.790 --> 05:14.444
that's just dying
to be you for the day.

05:14.531 --> 05:16.272
Oh, I'll leave the cheating
to you, Chuck.

05:16.359 --> 05:18.405
'I plan on taking
the SATs myself.'

05:20.537 --> 05:22.757
You have no idea
how lucky you are.

05:22.844 --> 05:25.412
Seriously, Jenny. I would do
anything to be a freshman again.

05:25.499 --> 05:27.196
Junior year sucks.
Nate doesn't call.

05:27.283 --> 05:28.850
I'm not ready for the SATs.

05:28.937 --> 05:31.113
Maybe I should join
Kati on the Kibbutz in Israel.

05:31.200 --> 05:33.681
- Quit now.
- You guys, it's just a test.

05:33.768 --> 05:36.336
Look, cram session tonight.
My dad's making lasagna.

05:36.423 --> 05:37.772
My brother's got
tons of flash cards

05:37.859 --> 05:39.164
and I'm totally
available to help.

05:39.251 --> 05:42.211
That won't be necessary,
Little J.

05:42.298 --> 05:43.734
You girls are all taken care of

05:46.171 --> 05:47.390
Are you serious?

'If you're gonna sweat the test'

05:48.478 --> 05:49.653
'it better not clog your pores.'

05:49.740 --> 05:51.176
This evening at my penthouse

05:51.263 --> 05:52.613
you'll find personal tutors

05:52.700 --> 05:54.266
'hot stone massages, mani-pedis'

05:54.354 --> 05:55.659
and an amazing acupuncturist

05:55.746 --> 05:57.226
who specializes
in mental acuity.

05:57.313 --> 05:58.793
Guess that beats
my dad's lasagna.

05:58.880 --> 06:00.664
I'll Flickr over
some photos for you.

06:00.751 --> 06:03.624
Oh, it's upperclassmen only.
I'm sure you understand.

06:03.711 --> 06:05.190
Totally.

06:09.847 --> 06:12.807
Wait up, B.

06:12.894 --> 06:15.157
I'm so glad I didn't book
that flight to Tel Aviv.

Spotted in the halls
of Constance

06:17.333 --> 06:20.815
Little J realizing that age
really does come before beauty.

06:22.556 --> 06:24.340
- SATs?
- Yeah.

06:24.427 --> 06:25.994
Yeah, and, uh, soccer?

06:26.081 --> 06:27.343
Why not give
the old ball a kick?

06:27.430 --> 06:29.867
Season's just around
the corner...in October.

06:29.954 --> 06:31.608
No, no, you know what?
I have to stop doing that.

06:31.695 --> 06:34.306
I'll just focus on myself
and my-my test and my prep.

06:34.394 --> 06:36.744
What other people do or don't do
is about them, absolutely.

06:36.831 --> 06:38.746
Not a good tester, huh?

06:41.705 --> 06:44.882
Oh, Chuck, I had no idea
you felt that way about me.

06:44.969 --> 06:47.581
Good to know you're
at least still kind of funny.

06:47.668 --> 06:49.321
Hey, I'm so sorry,
I've been completely

06:49.409 --> 06:50.497
off the radar
the past few days.

06:50.584 --> 06:52.107
New home, new family.
It's okay.

06:52.194 --> 06:54.979
Yeah, it's, um,
pretty overwhelming.

06:55.066 --> 06:57.547
Yeah, I-I've been a little
overwhelmed myself lately.

06:57.634 --> 07:00.158
Well, you wanna
hang out...study?

07:00.245 --> 07:03.161
Hmm, ooh, I wanna take
whatever SAT prep course

07:03.248 --> 07:04.162
you're signed up for.

07:04.249 --> 07:05.512
Well, it's not too late.

07:05.599 --> 07:06.556
[chuckling]

07:06.643 --> 07:08.428
Okay. I'm in, then.

07:08.515 --> 07:10.212
I'll see you.

07:13.520 --> 07:15.478
You always did know
how to leave 'em wanting more.

07:19.177 --> 07:20.570
Oh, my God, Georgina.

07:28.839 --> 07:30.362
- What are you doing here?
- Well, I told you I was coming.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.408
Didn't you get my gifts?

07:32.495 --> 07:35.542
Uh, you're supposed to be
in Switzerland dating a prince.

07:35.629 --> 07:37.587
Luckily, daddy
didn't need the G5.

07:37.674 --> 07:40.285
Haven't you missed me?

07:40.372 --> 07:42.331
- How could I not?
- Okay.

07:42.418 --> 07:43.724
You don't want to throw me
a homecoming party.

07:43.811 --> 07:47.292
I get it, but let's have
a cocktail, catch up.

07:49.904 --> 07:52.776
S, you're really gonna
hurt my feelings.

07:52.863 --> 07:55.170
And you know how I get
when my feelings are hurt.

08:00.392 --> 08:02.177
Great. I'll see you tonight.

08:02.264 --> 08:04.309
It's so weird seeing you.

08:04.396 --> 08:05.833
It's almost like I never left.

she's seen a ghost

08:19.324 --> 08:21.501
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

08:23.198 --> 08:25.026
Jenny, why did you want
to meet here?

08:25.113 --> 08:27.158
Well, I've been thinking
what's the one thing

08:27.245 --> 08:29.726
that no one in our group has,
I mean, not even Blair?

08:29.813 --> 08:32.860
- Compassion?
- No, a boyfriend.

08:32.947 --> 08:35.253
You know, if I'm gonna make it
to queen, I need a king.

08:35.340 --> 08:36.646
'Queen Elizabeth
never had a boyfriend.'

08:36.733 --> 08:38.518
But she only had
the Spanish to conquer

08:38.605 --> 08:40.215
and I have Blair Waldorf.

08:40.302 --> 08:41.521
'Let's talk qualifications.'

08:41.608 --> 08:45.089
He has to be cute,
but not full of himself.

08:45.176 --> 08:47.135
He has to be from
the right kind of family..

I'm so sorry.
Are you okay?

Yeah, uh,
my lunch isn't, though.

Oh, Linus.

Let me give you..

09:09.549 --> 09:11.899
...my last dollar.

09:11.986 --> 09:13.117
Oh, I couldn't.

09:13.204 --> 09:14.162
You shouldn't be walking

09:14.249 --> 09:15.859

09:15.946 --> 09:17.687
Let's just settle
for an IOU, then.

09:17.774 --> 09:19.036
It's just a hot dog.

09:19.123 --> 09:22.779
That was just my excuse
to give this to you.

Hey, Nate.
What are you doing here?

10:08.259 --> 10:09.304
I mean, I know
the coffee's good.

10:09.391 --> 10:10.348
Since I've taken every

10:10.435 --> 10:12.002
SAT prep and review class

10:12.089 --> 10:14.309
in the five boroughs, I figured
why not pay it forward?

10:14.396 --> 10:15.658
So-so you don't need these?

10:15.745 --> 10:16.833
You know, I've actually
already taken it.

10:16.920 --> 10:18.530
My parents don't want me
going to USCs

10:18.618 --> 10:20.532
so I had to make sure
my scores were good enough

10:20.620 --> 10:22.534
to get in without their help,
which, thanks to these books

10:22.622 --> 10:24.319
they were, so I'm done.

10:24.406 --> 10:27.104
While we all love hearing about
the struggles of the idle rich

10:27.191 --> 10:29.629
Dan's got
a fine tutor right here.

10:29.716 --> 10:31.195
I ace every practice
test I take

10:31.282 --> 10:32.675
so we don't need your
hand-me-downs.

10:32.762 --> 10:35.025
Um, you know what?
Th-this is actually pretty good.

10:35.112 --> 10:36.113
This looks good. Thank you.

10:36.200 --> 10:37.245
Is there a reason you insist

so desperate and needy?

we used to hang out, Georgie.

how about for one night

but unlike old times

11:45.269 --> 11:48.055
I won't get out of control,
unless you want me to.

get out, no, okay.

There are no kings
on Craigslist.

But I don't think
he's the walker.

18:45.515 --> 18:47.256
