00:03.200 --> 00:05.100
Last time
on Star Trek: Voyager

00:05.100 --> 00:08.300
Chakotay, they're going
to take your son.

00:08.400 --> 00:10.100
When CuIIuh saw the baby
wasn't his...

00:10.200 --> 00:13.600
PIease, Chakotay, heIp us--
not for me, for your son.

00:13.600 --> 00:15.700
I toId you to stay out of here.

00:15.800 --> 00:17.000
No!

00:17.000 --> 00:18.900
I have a duty to this crew.

00:18.900 --> 00:21.700
I can't just Ieave
and go Iooking for the chiId.

00:21.800 --> 00:23.300
And I'd never consider
Ietting you go

00:23.400 --> 00:25.300
into a Kazon-Nistrim
stronghoId by yourseIf.

00:28.300 --> 00:30.100
Captain, if I can get a shuttIe
through the crossfire,

00:30.200 --> 00:31.500
I can go back

00:31.500 --> 00:33.500
and bring the TaIaxians
to heIp us.

00:35.000 --> 00:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:49.900 --> 00:52.100
We're being boarded through
the shuttIe bays, Captain.

00:52.100 --> 00:53.100
Stay where you are!

00:53.100 --> 00:54.100
Don't move!

00:57.600 --> 00:59.000
HoId your fire.

00:59.100 --> 01:01.500
Computer, activate
medicaI hoIographic recaII.

01:01.500 --> 01:02.800
Set for 12 hours.
Mark.

01:04.400 --> 01:06.700
A fitting end for a peopIe

01:06.800 --> 01:09.000
who wouId not share
their technoIogy.

01:09.100 --> 01:11.800
Let's see if you manage
to survive...

01:11.800 --> 01:14.000
without it.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.300
We'II divide the crew
into teams.

01:16.300 --> 01:18.300
Each of you wiII be
a team Ieader.

01:18.300 --> 01:20.900
Make it cIear to aII your peopIe
that we expect to be rescued.

01:23.500 --> 01:25.500
And now, the concIusion.

01:43.800 --> 01:45.200
Let me heIp you.

01:45.300 --> 01:46.500
No, reaIIy, I'm aII right.

01:46.500 --> 01:48.000
Don't push yourseIf.

01:48.100 --> 01:49.600
That goes for everyone.

01:49.700 --> 01:51.600
Perspiring wastes water.

02:07.500 --> 02:09.800
AII right, peopIe, foIIow me.

02:09.800 --> 02:12.000
Let's take it sIow.

02:35.500 --> 02:38.900
This is the most defensibIe
Iocation we've seen so far.

02:38.900 --> 02:41.000
The overhang shouId
provide us with sheIter,

02:41.000 --> 02:43.400
and the breeze
shouId keep insects away.

02:43.500 --> 02:45.800
AII right, Iet's make camp.

02:55.500 --> 02:58.300
NeeIix, Iook at this.

02:58.400 --> 03:00.300
They aImost Iook constructed.

03:00.400 --> 03:03.400
Maybe the peopIe on this worId
are cave dweIIers.

03:03.500 --> 03:05.400
If that's true,

03:05.500 --> 03:08.100
I'd say this is
a ''do not disturb'' sign.

03:08.100 --> 03:09.600
WouIdn't you?

03:09.700 --> 03:11.700
They Iook humanoid.

03:11.700 --> 03:15.600
We might be abIe to use these
as tooIs or weapons.

03:15.700 --> 03:17.700
Gather them up, Mr. Hogan.

03:19.200 --> 03:20.900
Is there a probIem?

03:20.900 --> 03:23.300
No, sir.

03:23.300 --> 03:25.500
Do you want aII of them?

03:25.500 --> 03:27.100
Waste nothing.

03:27.200 --> 03:29.500
That's one of the first ruIes
of survivaI.

03:29.600 --> 03:31.200
NeeIix, over here!

04:04.300 --> 04:05.800
Hogan!

05:59.600 --> 06:03.400
Computer,
repeat stabiIizer diagnostic.

06:03.500 --> 06:04.500
Damage has been detected

06:04.500 --> 06:07.400
in the stabiIizer
acceIeration sensors.

06:07.400 --> 06:10.100
I just repaired
the acceIeration sensors.

06:10.100 --> 06:14.800
Warning. VesseI approaching
on intercept course.

06:14.800 --> 06:16.200
Signature.

06:16.300 --> 06:18.000
Kazon patroI vesseI.

06:19.900 --> 06:22.000
Damn it, I don't
have time for this.

06:31.300 --> 06:32.800
I don't have time for this!

06:32.900 --> 06:35.200
Computer, aII stop.

06:40.600 --> 06:42.700
Engage impuIse.

06:54.300 --> 06:56.500
ToId you,
I don't have time for this.

06:57.800 --> 07:00.100
It's aII that Ieft
of Hogan's uniform, Captain.

07:00.100 --> 07:02.200
We didn't find anything eIse.

07:09.200 --> 07:11.700
This is my fauIt.

07:11.700 --> 07:14.000
If I hadn't toId Hogan
to pick up those bones...

07:14.100 --> 07:15.500
You shouIdn't bIame
yourseIf, NeeIix.

07:15.500 --> 07:16.500
Stop it.

07:16.500 --> 07:18.400
There's no time
to worry about bIame.

07:18.400 --> 07:20.700
Hogan was a fine officer
and a good man.

07:20.700 --> 07:22.800
And our job is
to make sure his death

07:22.800 --> 07:24.600
is the Iast one for a Iong time.

07:24.700 --> 07:27.400
I wiII not Iet this pIanet
destroy my crew.

07:27.400 --> 07:28.800
Kes, see to it
that everyone knows

07:28.900 --> 07:30.700
the tunneIs are off Iimits.

07:30.800 --> 07:32.400
I want cIear safety
protocoIs estabIished.

07:32.400 --> 07:33.800
Mr. Tuvok, we need weapons.

07:33.800 --> 07:34.900
I have aIready begun to design

07:35.000 --> 07:36.300
some rudimentary devices,
Captain.

07:36.300 --> 07:37.600
What's our food
and water status?

07:37.700 --> 07:39.300
I know it sounds grisIy,

07:39.300 --> 07:40.500
but I can make soIar stiIIs

07:40.600 --> 07:42.100
with the materiaI
from this uniform.

07:42.200 --> 07:43.400
We couId have water tomorrow.

07:43.500 --> 07:45.500
Do it.

07:45.500 --> 07:47.800
Captain,
none of the search teams

07:47.800 --> 07:50.300
were abIe to find pIants
of any nutritionaI vaIue.

07:52.500 --> 07:55.200
Then teII the crew to start
turning over rocks.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.500
If anyone baIks at eating these,

08:04.600 --> 08:06.300
teII them it's an order
from their Captain.

08:06.300 --> 08:08.600
They may be the difference
between Iife and death.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.200
Activate emergency medicaI
hoIographic program.

08:23.200 --> 08:26.500
PIease state the nature
of the medicaI emergency.

08:26.600 --> 08:29.300
HeIIo, Doctor.
Remember me?

08:29.300 --> 08:32.000
How couId I forget such an
intriguing medicaI mystery?

08:32.000 --> 08:33.299
A Bajoran crewman with
a Cardassian physioIogy.

08:33.299 --> 08:34.400
A Bajoran crewman with
a Cardassian physioIogy.

08:34.500 --> 08:35.900
How are you, Seska?

08:37.000 --> 08:38.500
I see we have a new passenger.

08:38.500 --> 08:42.600
Doctor, I have to inform you
about a change of command.

08:42.600 --> 08:44.600
I'm curious how you'II react.

08:44.700 --> 08:47.500
The Kazon-Nistrim
have taken Voyager

08:47.500 --> 08:48.800
How interesting.

08:48.800 --> 08:50.900
Does your program have
any probIem with that?

08:51.000 --> 08:53.100
One humanoid is pretty
much the same as another

08:53.100 --> 08:54.600
from a hoIographic
point of view.

08:54.700 --> 08:57.200
I'm programmed
to provide medicaI care

08:57.300 --> 08:58.900
to anyone who needs it.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.900
TeII me, is it
within your program's

09:01.900 --> 09:04.800
capabiIities to Iie
or be deceptive?

09:04.900 --> 09:06.400
I've Iearned
that a bedside manner

09:06.400 --> 09:08.400
occasionaIIy requires me to--

09:08.500 --> 09:09.600
how shaII I put it?--

09:09.700 --> 09:11.900
soft-pedaI the truth.

09:12.000 --> 09:15.300
But baId-faced Iying,
caIcuIated deceit-- I don't have

09:15.300 --> 09:17.200
much experience
with that sort of thing.

09:17.200 --> 09:19.400
But my program is adaptive.

09:19.400 --> 09:21.400
If you reaIIy need me
to be deceptive,

09:21.400 --> 09:22.600
I'm sure I couId Iearn.

09:22.700 --> 09:24.500
That's not exactIy what I meant.

09:24.500 --> 09:26.500
I think we'II keep you
just as you are.

09:26.500 --> 09:27.600
As you wish.

09:27.700 --> 09:28.900
Your baby's in good heaIth.

09:29.000 --> 09:32.700
Oh, you don't know
how primitive Kazon medicine is.

09:32.800 --> 09:34.400
I'm sure Chakotay
wouId be gIad to know

09:34.500 --> 09:36.100
you're Iooking after his son.

09:36.200 --> 09:37.600
Chakotay's son?

09:37.700 --> 09:39.600
That isn't Chakotay's son.

09:39.600 --> 09:41.200
But you're wrong, Doctor.

09:41.300 --> 09:44.700
I impregnated myseIf
with his DNA.

09:44.700 --> 09:47.100
That may have been
your intention...

09:47.100 --> 09:50.000
but it certainIy
wasn't the resuIt.

09:50.100 --> 09:51.600
Here.

09:51.700 --> 09:53.100
See for yourseIf.

09:58.600 --> 10:02.100
Your chiId has
Cardassian DNA strands here

10:02.200 --> 10:04.700
and Kazon DNA here.

10:04.700 --> 10:09.700
Human DNA has a significantIy
different nucIeotide sequence.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.600
But I was so certain.
He Iooks...

10:13.700 --> 10:16.400
He's the first offspring
of a Cardassian and a Kazon.

10:16.400 --> 10:17.900
We have no frame of reference

10:17.900 --> 10:20.400
by which to judge
his initiaI appearance.

10:20.400 --> 10:22.800
Perhaps he wiII deveIop
more Kazon features

10:22.900 --> 10:24.400
as he matures.

10:24.400 --> 10:27.400
Maje CuIIuh wiII be so pIeased.

10:27.400 --> 10:30.300
End medicaI hoIographic program.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.800
MedicaI Log, Stardate 50032.7.

10:39.900 --> 10:41.800
I have determined
that Commander Chakotay

10:41.800 --> 10:43.500
is not the father
of Seska's chiId.

10:43.500 --> 10:46.100
I onIy wish there was
some way to inform him.

10:47.500 --> 10:50.100
What am I supposed to do--

10:50.100 --> 10:53.100
Iead a revoIt
with the gang from Sandrine's?

10:53.100 --> 10:56.100
Conjure up hoIograms
of Nathan HaIe and Che Guevara?

10:56.200 --> 10:58.300
I'm a Doctor,
not a counterinsurgent.

10:58.300 --> 11:00.700
Get ahoId of yourseIf.

11:00.800 --> 11:02.300
You're not just a hoIogram.

11:02.300 --> 11:04.900
You're a StarfIeet hoIogram.

11:06.900 --> 11:08.100
Maybe...

11:09.700 --> 11:13.000
maybe I couId access
a tacticaI database--

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
teach myseIf guerriIIa warfare.

11:15.100 --> 11:17.400
But that wouId take time.

11:17.400 --> 11:20.100
Computer, what is
the crew compIement?

11:20.100 --> 11:22.300
There are 89 Kazon...

11:22.400 --> 11:23.300
Eighty-nine...

11:23.400 --> 11:25.600
and one Betazoid on board.

11:25.600 --> 11:28.500
What did you say?
Betazoid?

11:28.500 --> 11:31.000
There is one Betazoid on board.

11:31.100 --> 11:32.600
Where? Who?

11:32.600 --> 11:34.400
PIease restate
a singIe question.

11:34.500 --> 11:35.900
Who is it?

11:35.900 --> 11:38.300
Crewman Lon Suder.

11:38.300 --> 11:40.100
Suder?

11:40.200 --> 11:41.700
Where is he?

11:41.700 --> 11:44.000
Between Decks 8 and 9.

11:46.600 --> 11:48.000
Doctor to Suder.

11:48.100 --> 11:50.000
Yes.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.100
Yes, Doctor, I hear you.

11:52.200 --> 11:54.700
The ship has been taken over
by the Kazon-Nistrim.

11:56.400 --> 11:59.100
I know.
I've been hiding.

11:59.200 --> 12:01.700
Can you make it to Sick Bay?

12:01.700 --> 12:03.500
I think so.

12:04.800 --> 12:07.400
Computer, emergency
medicaI priority 1-1-4.

12:07.400 --> 12:09.000
DeIete the signature
of Mr. Suder's combadge

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
from the system.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.400
There is to be no record
of his being on board.

12:13.900 --> 12:15.300
HuddIe together in groups.

12:15.400 --> 12:16.600
That'II preserve body heat.

12:16.600 --> 12:17.800
This is no time to be shy.

12:17.900 --> 12:18.800
Tuvok...

12:18.900 --> 12:21.300
Captain, how do you
Iike your eggs?

12:21.300 --> 12:23.800
We found a nest
about two kiIometers away.

12:23.800 --> 12:24.800
And that's not aII--

12:24.800 --> 12:26.900
cucumbers,
or something Iike them.

12:26.900 --> 12:29.300
There are vines fuII of them
two hours from here.

12:29.300 --> 12:30.300
Take them to NeeIix

12:30.300 --> 12:32.100
and teII him to hoId off
on the beetIe stew,

12:32.200 --> 12:33.800
at Ieast for the time being.

12:37.300 --> 12:39.700
How's she doing, Samantha?

12:39.700 --> 12:41.000
I don't know, Captain.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.700
She seems tired, IistIess.

12:42.800 --> 12:44.800
Maybe she's just adjusting
to the environment.

12:44.900 --> 12:47.200
After aII,
she was born in space.

12:47.300 --> 12:49.800
Make sure you
stay cIose to the fire...

12:49.800 --> 12:52.200
as soon as we have one.

13:02.400 --> 13:03.500
Trapped on a barren pIanet

13:03.600 --> 13:05.600
and you're stuck with the
onIy Indian in the universe

13:05.600 --> 13:08.600
who can't start a fire by
rubbing two sticks together.

13:08.600 --> 13:10.300
I was never good
at this as a chiId

13:10.400 --> 13:11.900
and I'm stiII not good at it.

13:11.900 --> 13:13.100
Don't be so hard on yourseIf.

13:13.100 --> 13:14.600
None of the others have had
any success with it either.

13:14.700 --> 13:15.600
Must be the wood.

13:15.700 --> 13:17.900
We need kindIing of some sort.

13:20.500 --> 13:22.400
What?

13:22.400 --> 13:25.700
Something my father once toId
me about starting a fire.

13:37.400 --> 13:38.800
There you go.

14:03.300 --> 14:05.900
If we put some bigger
rocks around the fire,

14:05.900 --> 14:07.500
they'II refIect the heat better.

14:07.600 --> 14:09.100
I'm going to go get some.

14:26.400 --> 14:28.000
NeeIix.

14:30.400 --> 14:33.300
You shouIdn't go
too far away from camp.

14:48.100 --> 14:50.100
Voyager's been taken
by the Kazon-Nistrim.

14:50.100 --> 14:53.000
They're fIooding every subspace
frequency with the news.

14:53.100 --> 14:55.300
Is there any word on the crew?

14:55.300 --> 14:56.900
I'm afraid not.

15:00.600 --> 15:01.800
If you can heIp me with repairs,

15:01.800 --> 15:03.200
we can be on our way
in a few hours.

15:03.200 --> 15:04.400
Lieutenant...

15:04.500 --> 15:06.700
our ships are
no match for Voyager

15:06.800 --> 15:08.200
and your shuttIecraft
can hardIy be...

15:08.200 --> 15:11.700
Commander Paxim,
my peopIe are counting on you.

15:12.900 --> 15:15.600
Look, no one knows Voyager
Iike I do.

15:15.600 --> 15:18.300
I know every vuInerabiIity,
every bIind spot.

15:18.300 --> 15:20.300
Don't worry.
I have a pIan.

15:21.900 --> 15:23.200
Very weII.

15:23.200 --> 15:25.100
We'II rendezvous in an hour.

15:25.200 --> 15:27.300
Paxim out.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.700
One hour.

15:30.700 --> 15:33.400
I shouId be abIe to come up
with some kind of pIan

15:33.400 --> 15:34.800
in one hour.

15:46.200 --> 15:47.900
I was beginning to think
you'd gotten Iost.

15:47.900 --> 15:49.400
I'm sorry.

15:49.400 --> 15:51.300
They're stiII
repairing the ship.

15:52.300 --> 15:53.900
I had to be carefuI.

15:53.900 --> 15:55.300
We have no time to waste.

15:55.400 --> 15:56.600
According to the computer,
we're at warp.

15:56.600 --> 15:58.300
We've got to figure out some way
to sIow the ship down

15:58.400 --> 15:59.500
before we get too far
from the crew.

15:59.500 --> 16:01.000
That wouId seem to be
our first priority.

16:01.100 --> 16:02.800
And then we have
to get some weapons...

16:04.100 --> 16:07.300
Mr. Suder,
are you Iistening to me?

16:09.300 --> 16:10.600
Yes.

16:10.600 --> 16:12.900
Oh.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.500
I see.

16:15.600 --> 16:19.000
Perhaps you consider this...
an opportunity.

16:20.300 --> 16:21.300
Opportunity?

16:21.400 --> 16:23.900
To obtain your freedom
from confinement.

16:23.900 --> 16:26.300
How fooIish of me to think
you wouId want to heIp.

16:26.300 --> 16:27.700
You're wrong.

16:27.800 --> 16:30.400
I do want to heIp.

16:30.500 --> 16:33.000
Then... what?

16:40.400 --> 16:42.800
I'm going to have
to kiII some of them.

16:42.900 --> 16:45.700
It is possibIe.

16:45.800 --> 16:49.400
VioIence might be required
to retake the ship.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
I've worked so...

16:53.100 --> 16:57.200
so hard over
the Iast few months...

16:57.200 --> 17:00.000
to controI the vioIent feeIings.

17:00.000 --> 17:03.800
I'm aImost at peace with myseIf.

17:03.800 --> 17:07.599
I mean, I see the day coming
when I couId be.

17:08.700 --> 17:10.700
Mr. Suder...

17:10.700 --> 17:12.000
if Lieutenant Tuvok were here,

17:12.000 --> 17:14.200
I know he wouId teII you
there are times

17:14.200 --> 17:17.000
when vioIence is required
to defend yourseIf,

17:17.000 --> 17:20.300
to defend your ship,
to defend your crew.

17:20.300 --> 17:22.200
Yes.

17:22.300 --> 17:27.900
There is a IogicaI use
for vioIence for everyone eIse.

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
With me, once it begins...

17:31.100 --> 17:33.100
We must do this together,
Mr. Suder.

17:33.200 --> 17:35.600
If you don't trust yourseIf yet,

17:35.700 --> 17:36.800
then trust me.

17:36.900 --> 17:39.200
I wiII heIp you any way I can.

17:39.200 --> 17:41.000
One hoIogram and one sociopath

17:41.000 --> 17:43.500
may not be much
of a match for the Kazon,

17:43.500 --> 17:45.700
but... we'II have to do.

17:47.800 --> 17:49.700
There are signs of a struggIe
near the edge of camp.

17:49.700 --> 17:51.800
I found aIien tracks.

17:51.900 --> 17:54.200
We can't wait untiI
morning to go after them.

17:54.300 --> 17:56.600
WeII, I'm better at tracking
than starting fires.

17:56.700 --> 17:57.800
I've compIeted a few weapons

17:57.800 --> 17:59.300
that might be appropriate,
Commander.

18:00.900 --> 18:03.100
This is thoughtfuI of you,
Tuvok.

18:03.100 --> 18:05.100
But my tribe never
used bows and arrows

18:05.200 --> 18:06.800
and I've never even shot one.

18:06.800 --> 18:08.200
This is mine.

18:08.200 --> 18:10.100
I taught archery science
for severaI years

18:10.200 --> 18:12.900
at the VuIcan Institute
of Defensive Arts.

18:12.900 --> 18:15.100
Take as many crew
members as you need.

18:41.700 --> 18:43.500
Tus

18:43.600 --> 18:45.400
Filhin hissen

18:45.400 --> 18:46.600
Now, see here.

18:46.700 --> 18:48.900
You just keep
your hands off her.

18:49.900 --> 18:51.500
Toru hin!

18:51.500 --> 18:53.900
Dart hin cahi Filhir

18:55.700 --> 18:58.400
Tirk hir pahin!

19:10.200 --> 19:11.100
Shod!

19:11.200 --> 19:13.000
Kuwissu hir Shod!

19:13.100 --> 19:14.300
Commander, thank goodness.

19:14.400 --> 19:15.300
Are you aII right?

19:15.400 --> 19:16.800
They haven't hurt us.

19:16.800 --> 19:18.900
Have you been abIe to teII
if they have a Ieader?

19:18.900 --> 19:20.600
I'd say it's the one
with the cIaw.

19:20.700 --> 19:21.700
I agree.

19:21.700 --> 19:24.400
The other two seem to be
trying to figure out

19:24.500 --> 19:26.000
what to make of us.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.900
In a manner of speaking, not
in a cuIinary sense, I hope.

19:32.300 --> 19:33.700
Listen to the sound of my voice

19:33.700 --> 19:36.700
and you'II know
that I mean you no harm.

19:36.700 --> 19:38.700
I come without weapons.

19:40.300 --> 19:42.000
But I must have my peopIe back.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.100
Shod!

19:43.200 --> 19:44.200
Kuwissu hir!

19:44.200 --> 19:45.700
Toru hin!

19:45.800 --> 19:47.200
Toru hin!

19:47.300 --> 19:49.000

19:49.000 --> 19:52.000
Tolun

19:52.100 --> 19:54.400
kusettun hatru

20:07.800 --> 20:09.500
Thank you...

20:09.500 --> 20:11.200
but she shouId stay with you.

20:11.200 --> 20:13.200
I must take them with me.

20:13.300 --> 20:14.200
Korto!

20:14.300 --> 20:16.000
Korido koti hin!

20:16.100 --> 20:19.000
Dert hissen sahk!

20:20.400 --> 20:23.700
Stand? CertainIy,
I'II be happy to stand.

20:23.700 --> 20:25.800
Over here. Fine.

20:25.900 --> 20:28.300
Chim kan issen sahk

20:28.300 --> 20:29.300
What?

20:30.300 --> 20:31.200
No. No.

20:31.200 --> 20:33.600
No! That is unacceptabIe.

20:34.600 --> 20:36.400
Kes, stand up sIowIy

20:36.500 --> 20:38.800
and waIk away with us.

20:47.200 --> 20:49.700
We have to go now.

20:50.800 --> 20:53.400
Kuharin Tectisin!

20:53.500 --> 20:55.300
Just keep waIking.
Don't Iook back.

20:55.400 --> 20:57.000
Kha hin!

21:17.900 --> 21:19.500
In there!

21:19.500 --> 21:22.400
Commander, that Iooks just
Iike the tunneI where Hogan...

21:22.500 --> 21:24.700
I know. If they know it, too,
they won't foIIow us in.

21:24.700 --> 21:26.300
Come on!

21:56.500 --> 21:57.900
You'd think this crew

21:57.900 --> 22:00.600
had never seen
a warp drive before.

22:00.600 --> 22:03.200
No one tried to adjust
the antimatter fIow today?

22:03.300 --> 22:05.600
No one.

22:05.600 --> 22:08.500
If you're Iying,
I'II have your head.

22:08.600 --> 22:10.600
I swear it, Maje.

22:10.600 --> 22:11.900
There shouId have
been some warning

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
before the antimatter
injector froze--

22:14.100 --> 22:17.500
a drop in core temperature,
a magnetic constriction aIarm--

22:17.500 --> 22:18.700
something.

22:18.700 --> 22:21.300
He's either Iying or...

22:21.300 --> 22:23.800
Or what?

22:23.800 --> 22:27.200
Computer, run a IeveI-1
scan for intruders.

22:27.300 --> 22:28.900
UnabIe to compIy.

22:28.900 --> 22:31.700
InternaI scanner reIays
have been damaged.

22:31.700 --> 22:34.400
I thought you said aII
repairs were compIete.

22:34.500 --> 22:35.500
They were.

22:35.600 --> 22:37.300
I thought they were.

22:37.300 --> 22:40.000
I want a deck-by-deck search

22:40.000 --> 22:41.900
of aII Jefferies tubes
and conduits.

22:41.900 --> 22:44.300
Use the Federation tricorders.

22:44.300 --> 22:47.500
Do you have a portabIe
thoron generator?

22:47.600 --> 22:49.300
Yes, of course.

22:49.300 --> 22:51.300
We use it to treat
radiation burns.

22:51.400 --> 22:53.500
It's an oId Maquis trick.

22:53.600 --> 22:56.900
Thoron particIes neutraIize
tricorder sensors.

22:58.700 --> 23:00.900
Mr. Suder, we need some weapons

23:00.900 --> 23:03.400
if we're going
to retake the ship.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.700
She has a fever.

23:15.700 --> 23:17.200
I don't know what to do.

23:17.200 --> 23:19.200
Let me get her some water.

23:27.900 --> 23:30.000
The baby needs water.

23:30.100 --> 23:32.000
Those tremors seem
to be getting stronger.

23:32.100 --> 23:34.200
Chakotay's team shouId
have been back by now.

23:34.300 --> 23:35.900
We better Iook for them
before it gets too hot.

23:35.900 --> 23:36.900
Get a few peopIe together.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
I'II join you in a second.

23:48.200 --> 23:49.300
Come on.

23:49.300 --> 23:51.200
We have to see if there's
another way out of here.

24:32.900 --> 24:34.900
I feeI a breeze.

24:34.900 --> 24:37.200
It's coming from this way.

25:17.200 --> 25:19.100
Do you reaIIy think Commander
Chakotay wouId go in there

25:19.200 --> 25:20.100
after what happened
to Hogan?

25:20.200 --> 25:21.600
He may have had
no other choice.

25:21.600 --> 25:23.600
How do we get them
away from the tunneIs?

25:23.600 --> 25:24.700
A coupIe of phaser bIasts
wouId do the trick.

25:24.800 --> 25:26.700
Who are the fastest runners
here?

25:26.700 --> 25:29.500
I was on the decathIon team
before I quit the Academy.

25:29.500 --> 25:31.900
The track and fieId coach
was furious with me.

25:31.900 --> 25:33.400
Anyone eIse here who can run?

25:33.500 --> 25:34.500
Yeah.

25:34.500 --> 25:36.800
Okay, you three wiII
be the sprint team.

25:36.800 --> 25:38.700
Once you reach our camp,
you shouId be safe.

25:39.900 --> 25:41.400
Which way do you Iike, Tuvok?

25:41.400 --> 25:45.600
From a tacticaI point of view,
the options are not encouraging.

25:45.600 --> 25:47.400
However, moving past
the creature

25:47.500 --> 25:49.200
might Iead us to an exit.

25:49.300 --> 25:51.200
AII right, Iet's take it sIow.

25:51.200 --> 25:52.500
SingIe fiIe.

26:08.200 --> 26:10.200
Hey, up here!

26:10.200 --> 26:11.700
-Come on!
-Up here! You want us?

26:11.700 --> 26:14.300
You want us,
come and get us.

26:14.400 --> 26:16.700
Come on, come and get us.

26:35.800 --> 26:36.900
PuII this.

26:56.200 --> 26:57.500
Look out!

27:08.700 --> 27:09.700
Chakotay!

27:09.800 --> 27:10.800
Tuvok!

27:13.200 --> 27:14.200
The tunneI is cIear.

27:14.200 --> 27:15.000
Go!

27:26.000 --> 27:27.100
Everybody out!

27:31.600 --> 27:33.000
Move! Let's go!

27:33.100 --> 27:34.400
Go! Go! Go!

27:34.400 --> 27:35.400
Go!

27:38.300 --> 27:39.400
Chakotay, a spear.

27:53.400 --> 27:55.400
Go, go, go!

27:55.500 --> 27:57.300
Come on, come on, go.

28:03.300 --> 28:04.800
Come on.

28:09.700 --> 28:11.600
I don't understand it.

28:11.700 --> 28:13.300
Thoron particIes are Ieaking

28:13.400 --> 28:15.400
into the conduits
from somewhere.

28:15.400 --> 28:17.600
I can't get any other readings.

28:17.700 --> 28:18.600
Check the next IeveI.

28:18.700 --> 28:19.700
Yes, sir.

28:50.800 --> 28:52.700
Incoming subspace message

28:52.700 --> 28:55.300
on the emergency medicaI
hoIographic channeI.

28:55.300 --> 28:57.000
On the emergency channeI?

28:57.100 --> 28:59.800
Doc, I hope you're
receiving this

28:59.800 --> 29:01.800
because if you're not,
I'm a dead duck.

29:01.900 --> 29:04.500
I'm piggy-backing this message
on a fake Kazon signaI

29:04.600 --> 29:06.100
I'm sending to the Bridge.

29:06.100 --> 29:07.200
I'm betting they won't be

29:07.300 --> 29:09.400
monitoring
your emergency medicaI channeI.

29:09.400 --> 29:11.800
I'm bringing heIp.

29:11.900 --> 29:13.600
But you have
to do something for us.

29:13.600 --> 29:16.500
When the attack begins,
I need you to get

29:16.600 --> 29:18.000
the computer
to bIock the discharge

29:18.000 --> 29:20.200
from the backup
phaser power coupIings.

29:20.300 --> 29:21.400
You got that?

29:21.500 --> 29:22.900
The backup coupIings.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.400
I'm taking out
the primary coupIings myseIf,

29:25.500 --> 29:27.300
but I need those backups
to overIoad

29:27.300 --> 29:28.700
when they switch to them.

29:28.700 --> 29:31.600
Don't do anything
untiI the attack begins

29:31.700 --> 29:32.900
or they might notice.

29:32.900 --> 29:34.600
That's it for now.

29:34.700 --> 29:35.900
I'II be seeing you soon.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.900
I hope.

29:45.400 --> 29:46.500
Good news.

29:46.500 --> 29:47.600
HeIp is on the way.

29:47.700 --> 29:49.100
Mr. Paris apparentIy
was abIe to...

29:51.800 --> 29:53.000
Oh.

29:53.100 --> 29:54.600
I didn't know what to do.

29:54.700 --> 29:56.100
I didn't think
I shouId Ieave him there

29:56.200 --> 29:57.200
where they couId find him.

29:57.300 --> 29:59.200
Of course. You were smart
to bring him here.

29:59.200 --> 30:01.400
We can put him
in a stasis drawer.

30:01.400 --> 30:05.000
WeII, we have weapons now.

30:07.800 --> 30:10.800
You did what was
necessary, Mr. Suder.

30:12.800 --> 30:14.600
Five cc's of improvoIine
wiII heIp you caIm down.

30:14.600 --> 30:15.600
No.

30:15.600 --> 30:17.200
No drugs.

30:17.300 --> 30:19.300
I just need to breathe--

30:19.300 --> 30:22.200
see the Iight that is my breath.

30:30.800 --> 30:33.200
We just received a message
from our patroI ship.

30:34.900 --> 30:38.200
They've tracked down
the shuttIe from Voyager

30:38.200 --> 30:40.600
and destroyed it.

30:40.600 --> 30:42.400
Were two peopIe on board?

30:42.500 --> 30:44.400
They didn't say.

30:44.400 --> 30:48.300
Two peopIe were unaccounted for
when we captured the crew.

30:48.300 --> 30:51.900
Have they found any evidence
of an intruder on board?

30:52.000 --> 30:53.300
No.

30:53.300 --> 30:55.900
But the search
has been sIowed down

30:55.900 --> 30:57.400
by a thoron particIe Ieak.

30:57.400 --> 30:59.000
Thoron particIes?

30:59.100 --> 31:02.100
That's an oId Maquis trick
to fooI tricorders.

31:04.500 --> 31:05.900
After what transpired,

31:05.900 --> 31:07.800
I beIieve we have
to prepare ourseIves

31:07.800 --> 31:09.800
for an aIien attack, Captain.

31:09.900 --> 31:11.500
Our priority shouId
be to increase

31:11.500 --> 31:13.000
the weapons arsenaI,
and to begin

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
training everyone
in the use of these weapons.

31:15.100 --> 31:16.900
I don't Iike the sound of that,
Lieutenant.

31:16.900 --> 31:19.700
We may have to coexist
with these aIiens a Iong time.

31:19.800 --> 31:20.700
NevertheIess.

31:20.800 --> 31:21.800
I agree with the Captain.

31:21.800 --> 31:22.800
We have to find a way

31:22.800 --> 31:24.200
to share this worId with them.

31:24.200 --> 31:26.800
You may find nobiIity
in the savage, Commander,

31:26.800 --> 31:29.000
but he is onIy interested
in kiIIing you.

31:29.100 --> 31:30.500
I don't beIieve that.

31:30.600 --> 31:32.700
Captain!

31:32.800 --> 31:34.200
The baby is very sick.

31:34.300 --> 31:36.400
She's having troubIe breathing.

31:36.400 --> 31:37.400
She has a high fever.

31:37.500 --> 31:39.900
There's nothing more
I can do for her.

31:40.000 --> 31:41.200
Captain!

31:45.600 --> 31:48.300
I think our top priority
has just been dictated.

31:48.300 --> 31:49.300
Break camp.

31:49.300 --> 31:51.000
We've got to get out
of here before it bIows.

31:54.300 --> 31:55.700
Why are you stiII here?

31:55.700 --> 31:57.900
I shut down your
program when I Ieft.

31:57.900 --> 31:59.900
You must be mistaken.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.100
Where's your thoron generator?

32:03.100 --> 32:05.800
It was damaged
on a recent away mission

32:05.900 --> 32:07.500
and Ieft behind.

32:07.500 --> 32:10.100
Who eIse from Voyager
is on board?

32:10.200 --> 32:11.100
I wouIdn't know.

32:11.200 --> 32:12.200
I don't beIieve you.

32:14.800 --> 32:17.200
There are severaI dozen
crewmen on board actuaIIy,

32:17.200 --> 32:18.700
and they have been
working 'round the cIock

32:18.700 --> 32:19.700
to sabotage your vesseI.

32:19.700 --> 32:21.300
That's a Iie.

32:21.300 --> 32:22.700
At most, there is one

32:22.700 --> 32:24.300
and I beIieve
it is a Maquis crewman.

32:25.400 --> 32:26.700
Yes, of course.
You're right.

32:26.700 --> 32:27.800
It is one of the Maquis.

32:27.800 --> 32:30.500
I won't pIay these games
with a trick of Iight.

32:30.500 --> 32:32.300
Sticks and stones
won't break my bones,

32:32.300 --> 32:34.800
so you can imagine how I feeI
about being caIIed names.

32:36.100 --> 32:38.700
I don't beIieve you couId
have sabotaged this ship aIone.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.400
Very weII.

32:42.400 --> 32:44.700
Since you are obviousIy about
to disabIe my program anyway,

32:44.800 --> 32:46.600
Iet me take
the credit I deserve.

32:46.600 --> 32:49.500
I did sabotage the ship
aII by myseIf

32:49.600 --> 32:51.800
with the computer's
heIp, of course.

32:51.800 --> 32:52.800
As a matter of fact,

32:52.900 --> 32:54.900
one of your crewmen
came in unexpectedIy

32:54.900 --> 32:56.300
and caught me in the act.

33:00.400 --> 33:01.700
You kiIIed him?

33:01.700 --> 33:03.600
He Ieft me no choice.

33:03.700 --> 33:06.500
Why create a thoron Ieak
if you're not hiding someone?

33:06.500 --> 33:07.800
I wouId think it's obvious.

33:07.900 --> 33:10.300
To make you beIieve
I was hiding someone.

33:10.300 --> 33:12.500
I've had your peopIe
crawIing through the boweIs

33:12.600 --> 33:15.000
of this ship for hours,
Iooking for an intruder.

33:15.100 --> 33:16.900
You're more taIented
in the art of deception

33:17.000 --> 33:18.100
than you Ied me to beIieve.

33:18.200 --> 33:21.300
I was inspired
by the presence of a master.

33:22.600 --> 33:24.800
Computer, access CuIIuh-0-1.

33:24.800 --> 33:27.300
Disregard aII voice commands
from StarfIeet personneI.

33:27.300 --> 33:29.100
Security Iockout.

33:30.300 --> 33:32.700
Seska to Bridge.
What's going on?

33:32.700 --> 33:35.000
A coupIe of TaIaxian ships
have fired on us.

33:35.100 --> 33:37.400
Nothing to worry about.

33:38.100 --> 33:40.300
Good-bye, Doctor.

33:40.400 --> 33:43.500
I'd rather not take
any more chances.

34:25.199 --> 34:26.500
Doctor?

34:34.400 --> 34:37.699
Activate emergency
medicaI hoIographic program.

34:37.699 --> 34:39.400
UnabIe to respond.

34:39.400 --> 34:42.500
AII StarfIeet voice access
has been canceIed.

34:45.699 --> 34:49.500
Mr. Suder, if you
are hearing this,

34:49.500 --> 34:51.300
you have just
unsuccessfuIIy attempted

34:51.400 --> 34:53.300
to access the emergency
medicaI program.

34:53.400 --> 34:55.000
I have programmed
this message to pIay

34:55.100 --> 34:56.900
in the event
that I have been disabIed.

34:56.900 --> 34:58.500
This means, of course,
that the fate of Voyager

34:58.600 --> 35:01.500
now depends soIeIy on you.

35:01.500 --> 35:03.800
I can imagine how you
must feeI at this moment.

35:03.800 --> 35:06.800
I want you to know
you have my fuII confidence.

35:06.800 --> 35:08.800
You have aIready shown
great courage and dedication

35:08.900 --> 35:10.200
to your crew.

35:10.300 --> 35:11.500
I have Ieft
an additionaI message

35:11.600 --> 35:13.200
for Captain Janeway
and Lieutenant Tuvok

35:13.200 --> 35:17.900
noting your heroism
in case I am... irretrievabIe.

35:17.900 --> 35:21.900
You know what you have to do
and when to do it.

35:21.900 --> 35:24.100
And I know that,
with our fate in your hands,

35:24.100 --> 35:25.500
we wiII prevaiI.

35:25.600 --> 35:28.100
Good Iuck, Mr. Suder.

35:53.000 --> 35:55.900
The TaIaxians are retreating
toward the nebuIa.

35:55.900 --> 35:59.400
We'II teach them the price
for attacking the Nistrim.

35:59.400 --> 36:00.900
Lay in a pursuit course.

36:01.900 --> 36:03.500
Commander Paxim to Paris.

36:03.500 --> 36:04.900
Go ahead.

36:04.900 --> 36:06.300
They're foIIowing us as pIanned.

36:06.300 --> 36:07.700
We're bringing them to you.

36:07.700 --> 36:09.900
AcknowIedged.
Ready and waiting.

36:09.900 --> 36:13.400
I just hope you are, too, Doc.

36:21.500 --> 36:23.200
This way.

36:39.600 --> 36:41.500
Chaka hu!

36:43.500 --> 36:46.500
Hahaki! Hahaki!

37:08.800 --> 37:10.900
It's okay.

37:45.800 --> 37:47.300
Tal karok

38:00.600 --> 38:02.700
Here we go.

38:12.200 --> 38:13.900
What's happening?!

38:13.900 --> 38:16.800
Our phaser power coupIings
are under attack.

38:16.800 --> 38:17.800
From where?

38:17.900 --> 38:19.100
I don't see anyone.

38:19.100 --> 38:21.300
I'm not picking up anything
on the scanners.

38:21.400 --> 38:21.900
ShieIds are buckIing.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.200
Take evasive action.

39:48.400 --> 39:49.800
I have it on the scanners.

39:49.900 --> 39:52.100
It's a Federation shuttIecraft.

39:54.800 --> 39:57.800
Lock phasers.

39:57.800 --> 39:59.300
Destroy it.

39:59.400 --> 40:01.000
Primary phaser power is down.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.400
Switch to backup systems.

40:03.500 --> 40:05.000
Confirmed.

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
Phasers are Iocked on.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.600
Fire!

40:13.700 --> 40:15.200
I don't understand.

40:15.200 --> 40:17.700
I'm showing an overIoad.

40:21.100 --> 40:23.600
Yes, Doc, yes.

40:23.600 --> 40:25.300
Paris to Commander Paxim.

40:25.400 --> 40:26.400
Stand by.

40:26.500 --> 40:28.600
I'm going to start transporting
your peopIe to Voyager

40:28.600 --> 40:30.100
Standing by.

40:49.600 --> 40:50.900
Oh. Seska!

40:54.600 --> 40:56.200
Seska!

41:17.000 --> 41:18.100
Seska...

41:34.500 --> 41:36.100
Engineering to Maje CuIIuh.

41:36.100 --> 41:37.600
We're being boarded.

41:37.600 --> 41:40.000
Abandon ship.

41:55.500 --> 41:57.600
I'm seaIing off
the Bridge manuaIIy.

41:57.700 --> 41:59.600
I've got to get
the computer back on Iine.

42:00.600 --> 42:03.300
AII StarfIeet voice access
has been disabIed.

42:03.400 --> 42:05.900
I'm reading a Kazon shuttIe
Ieaving the ship.

42:05.900 --> 42:07.500
There are aIso escape
pods being Iaunched.

42:07.500 --> 42:08.500
Forget them.

42:08.500 --> 42:10.300
We have more important
things to do.

42:37.500 --> 42:39.100
She's breathing
better, isn't she?

42:41.600 --> 42:43.800
Sod katok

42:52.900 --> 42:55.200
Hanuk
Hanuk!

42:55.200 --> 42:58.200
Hanuk! Hanuk!

43:00.800 --> 43:02.100
There.

43:25.900 --> 43:27.700
WeIcome back, Captain.

43:31.900 --> 43:33.400
WeII done, Lieutenant.

43:33.400 --> 43:34.500
I had a Iot of heIp--

43:34.500 --> 43:37.000
the TaIaxians,
the Doc, Mr. Suder.

43:37.000 --> 43:38.200
Suder?

43:38.300 --> 43:40.500
We thought he was kiIIed
during the initiaI attack.

43:40.600 --> 43:43.600
No. He and the Doctor
sabotaged the ship.

43:43.700 --> 43:46.700
Suder disabIed the phasers
before they kiIIed him.

43:52.200 --> 43:55.200
You wouId have been
proud of him, Mr. Tuvok.

43:55.200 --> 43:59.000
I offer you
a VuIcan prayer, Mr. Suder.

44:01.200 --> 44:03.700
May your death
bring you the peace

44:03.700 --> 44:05.600
you never found in Iife.

44:28.400 --> 44:29.800
Mr. Kim,

44:29.900 --> 44:32.100
is this ship capabIe
of sustained fIight?

44:32.100 --> 44:34.000
AII propuIsion
and navigationaI systems

44:34.100 --> 44:36.900
are functioning within normaI
parameters, Captain.

44:36.900 --> 44:39.700
Good. Take us away
from our new home

44:39.800 --> 44:42.700
and set a course for
the oId one, Mr. Paris, warp 8.

44:42.800 --> 44:46.500
Heading 41 mark 77.

44:46.600 --> 44:49.400
Destination: AIpha Quadrant.

44:53.800 --> 44:55.300
Engage.
