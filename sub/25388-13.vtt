00:40.670 --> 00:41.903
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

00:41.938 --> 00:44.226
- Last night was...
- Unexpected?

00:44.262 --> 00:45.631
Full of surprises.

00:45.666 --> 00:47.675
Like Christmas or a haunted house?

00:47.710 --> 00:49.992
Well, there was a lot of moaning.

00:50.680 --> 00:52.413
So what happens now?

00:57.888 --> 01:00.855
You oversleep or you
forget our workout, huh?

01:00.891 --> 01:02.490
Hey, Chris. Sorry.

01:02.525 --> 01:05.160
Yeah. The... The night got away from me.

01:08.364 --> 01:10.531
So I see.

01:10.566 --> 01:12.700
Look, how about I meet you
at the gym in a half-hour?

01:12.735 --> 01:14.702
You sure you don't want longer?

01:14.737 --> 01:16.003
I'll see you there.

01:19.208 --> 01:21.208
- Do you think she saw me?
- She saw.

01:21.243 --> 01:23.711
Well, that is a 7.5

01:23.746 --> 01:25.546
- on the awkward scale.
- Look, don't worry, alright?

01:25.581 --> 01:27.648
Chris is as discreet as they come.

01:27.684 --> 01:29.317
Yeah, well, it's not just about Chris.

01:29.352 --> 01:30.818
What happens when we go back to work?

01:30.853 --> 01:33.220
Okay, I've slept with colleagues before.

01:33.255 --> 01:35.222
You know, you think it doesn't
change things, but it does.

01:35.257 --> 01:36.724
- Things get weird.
- They don't have to.

01:36.759 --> 01:38.192
I mean, we're grown-ups.

01:38.227 --> 01:40.294
We can deal with this.

01:40.329 --> 01:42.662
Maybe we just had to get this
out of our system.

01:42.698 --> 01:45.532
Yeah, you know, a-a-and now that we have,

01:45.567 --> 01:46.834
things don't have to change at all.

01:46.869 --> 01:48.401
We can act like it never happened.

01:48.437 --> 01:50.170
Right. We go to work,
we meet with clients,

01:50.206 --> 01:51.338
we solve cases.

01:51.373 --> 01:52.873
We're partners. That's it.

01:52.908 --> 01:54.908
- That's all.
- That's all.

01:54.944 --> 01:57.344
Oh, I got to go meet Syd for breakfast.

01:57.379 --> 01:58.745
No, no, you're not gonna tell
her about this.

01:58.780 --> 02:00.521
Of course not.

02:01.217 --> 02:04.584
Alright, well, I'll see you
at the office... partner.

02:04.619 --> 02:05.943
Yeah.

02:11.025 --> 02:13.092
See? Already weird.

02:15.686 --> 02:18.599

Synced & corrected by -robtor-

02:27.876 --> 02:29.375
And what if you haven't
gotten it out of your system?

02:29.410 --> 02:31.777
Neither of us wants to
ruin what we have, right?

02:31.812 --> 02:33.545
Even if it leads to something better?

02:33.581 --> 02:34.847
And what if it doesn't, huh?

02:34.883 --> 02:37.416
That was for being stupid.

02:37.451 --> 02:39.251
Look, you thought having her
around was gonna be a disaster,

02:39.286 --> 02:40.418
and look what happened.

02:40.453 --> 02:42.754
Business is better, and you're
not grumpy all the time.

02:42.789 --> 02:44.589
Okay, which is exactly why I
don't want things to change.

02:44.624 --> 02:46.291
This is why I stepped away.

02:46.326 --> 02:48.960
Our deal was only until one
of us found something more.

02:48.996 --> 02:50.528
Whether you admit it or not,

02:50.563 --> 02:52.197
this thing with Sam
has been going on for months.

02:52.232 --> 02:55.233
Pretending it's not there
isn't gonna make it go away.

02:58.805 --> 03:00.272
But I got to ask...

03:00.307 --> 03:01.639
how was it?

03:01.674 --> 03:03.708
She seemed to like it.

03:03.743 --> 03:06.211
Are you sure? I mean, she is an actress.

03:06.246 --> 03:07.412
Oh...

03:13.119 --> 03:14.786
Hey, Syd.

03:16.623 --> 03:17.755
Something's different.

03:17.791 --> 03:19.757
No. I'm the same.

03:19.793 --> 03:21.191
I mean, my hair's longer.

03:22.429 --> 03:23.528
You had sex.

03:25.031 --> 03:26.931
Doesn't the program say you're
supposed to wait a year?

03:26.966 --> 03:28.666
It's just suggested.

03:28.701 --> 03:30.000
I mean, it's not a rule.

03:30.036 --> 03:32.603
Just don't tell me that it's Eddie.

03:34.541 --> 03:36.841
Well, I guess it was inevitable.

03:36.876 --> 03:38.643
And hey, who am I to judge, right?

03:38.678 --> 03:40.311
It only happened once.

03:40.346 --> 03:42.513
Well, three times, technically.

03:42.549 --> 03:45.081
But we agreed...
we're not doing it again.

03:45.116 --> 03:46.917
The fact that you think
it's not gonna happen again

03:46.952 --> 03:48.478
is adorable.

03:49.220 --> 03:50.921
So, listen. This whole P.I. thing

03:50.956 --> 03:52.088
is getting some attention.

03:52.123 --> 03:53.957
There have been a couple of
requests for auditions...

03:53.992 --> 03:56.192
not worth sharing until now.

03:56.227 --> 03:57.928
There's a lead role in a big movie

03:57.963 --> 03:59.496
with this brilliant director.

03:59.531 --> 04:00.664
And they want you to audition.

04:00.699 --> 04:03.700
Now, it's a real long shot,
but that's not the point.

04:03.735 --> 04:05.702
The point is, the phones
are ringing again.

04:05.737 --> 04:07.804
So, if you're willing to audition...

04:07.840 --> 04:09.773
Yes. Yes, that is amazing.

04:10.909 --> 04:12.008
Oh.

04:13.812 --> 04:15.144
I got to go.

04:15.180 --> 04:16.779
But thank you, Syd.

04:21.918 --> 04:23.786
- Hey, Sam.
- Hi.

04:25.422 --> 04:27.122
You look so happy.

04:27.157 --> 04:28.824
- Do I?
- She's smiling.

04:28.860 --> 04:30.826
That usually indicates happiness.

04:30.862 --> 04:32.528
Your date with Troy must have gone well.

04:32.563 --> 04:33.896
I didn't hear you come home last night.

04:33.931 --> 04:35.230
With Troy, yeah.

04:35.265 --> 04:36.866
I was going out with Troy last night.

04:36.901 --> 04:39.502
Oh, yeah, how...
how was your date with Troy?

04:39.537 --> 04:40.903
It went really, really well.

04:40.938 --> 04:42.170
So well.

04:42.206 --> 04:44.172
You look happy, too.

04:44.208 --> 04:46.241
Do I?

04:46.276 --> 04:47.709
Your client's waiting in
the conference room.

04:47.744 --> 04:49.076
Her name's Emily Speer.

04:49.112 --> 04:50.578
She doesn't look happy.

04:50.614 --> 04:52.847
Hey, put this in, uh, my office
for me, alright?

04:55.051 --> 04:55.917
They did it.

04:55.952 --> 04:57.351
Pretty obvious.

04:57.387 --> 04:58.853
Things are gonna get weird.

04:58.889 --> 05:00.675
Tough luck, Troy.

05:01.457 --> 05:03.525
So, uh, how'd it go with Syd?

05:03.560 --> 05:05.226
Oh, I got an audition.

05:05.261 --> 05:06.427
For?

05:06.462 --> 05:08.029
Well, it's a movie.

05:08.064 --> 05:09.864
Um, Syd says it's a long shot,

05:09.900 --> 05:12.734
but I thought I might as well
dip my toe in, see how it feels.

05:13.130 --> 05:15.036
That's great. Really.

05:21.777 --> 05:24.078
I guess we shouldn't keep her waiting.

05:28.918 --> 05:32.520
Five days ago, I was the
happiest I've ever been.

05:32.555 --> 05:36.723
I was engaged to the man of
my dreams... Jackson Bristol.

05:38.894 --> 05:40.727
Oh, he's very handsome.

05:40.763 --> 05:42.263
He's a horse's ass.

05:42.298 --> 05:44.298
Four days ago,
I was coming home from work

05:44.333 --> 05:46.367
and went to my closet to get undressed.

05:46.402 --> 05:49.403
Jack's half of the closet...
completely empty.

05:49.439 --> 05:51.572
The son of a bitch even took the hangers.

05:51.607 --> 05:53.773
It was as if he'd never even been there.

05:53.808 --> 05:55.208
He didn't even leave a note?

05:55.243 --> 05:57.143
Not even a damn phone charger.

05:57.179 --> 05:58.778
Do you have any idea what
prompted him to go?

05:58.813 --> 06:00.746
Yeah, my money.

06:00.782 --> 06:03.616
$2.3 million in savings

06:03.651 --> 06:07.153
and every bit of valuable
jewelry that I own.

06:07.189 --> 06:09.889
I run a multi-million-dollar business.

06:09.924 --> 06:11.624
I'm in Mensa, for God's sake.

06:11.659 --> 06:13.960
As much as it kills me to admit it,

06:13.995 --> 06:15.128
I think I've been conned.

06:15.163 --> 06:16.629
Have you gone to the police?

06:16.664 --> 06:19.065
What? So that it can be public?

06:19.101 --> 06:21.934
And everyone can say
"Oh, poor, poor Emily.

06:21.970 --> 06:23.848
Did you hear what happened?" No.

06:23.883 --> 06:24.971
Been there.

06:25.006 --> 06:27.306
And you have no idea
where he might've gone?

06:28.977 --> 06:33.126
The only thing I have left
of his is this.

06:34.015 --> 06:35.081
Well, that's quite a watch.

06:35.116 --> 06:37.416
He said it was a family heirloom.

06:37.451 --> 06:39.518
I-I went to go get the band replaced

06:39.553 --> 06:42.187
for an early engagement present and...

06:42.223 --> 06:43.823
I don't know. Maybe you could use it

06:43.858 --> 06:45.491
to help find him.

06:45.526 --> 06:47.426
Uh, we can't make any promises,

06:47.461 --> 06:49.309
but we'll do our best to find him.

06:50.164 --> 06:51.864
I know he's out there.

06:51.899 --> 06:53.599
He's spending my hard-earned money.

06:53.635 --> 06:56.035
He's just laughing at me...

06:56.070 --> 06:58.237
all because I fell in love with him.

06:59.873 --> 07:01.821
A word of advice...

07:02.408 --> 07:03.975
Never fall in love.

07:14.087 --> 07:15.453
I thought that went well.

07:15.488 --> 07:17.989
Just our everyday, normal case interview.

07:18.025 --> 07:20.324
Yep. Business as usual.

07:21.995 --> 07:23.862
Don't look at me like that.

07:23.897 --> 07:25.396
Like what?

07:25.431 --> 07:26.931
Your eyes at my eyes.

07:28.601 --> 07:31.035
Hey. So, everything that

07:31.070 --> 07:33.070
Emily's fiancé told her was a lie.

07:33.105 --> 07:34.872
There is no Jackson Bristol.

07:34.907 --> 07:37.641
- And what about the watch?
- Top-of-the-line Petro-Robért.

07:37.677 --> 07:38.976
No engravings, no markings.

07:39.011 --> 07:40.210
Did you run the serial number?

07:40.245 --> 07:41.845
It's not registered as stolen,

07:41.881 --> 07:43.981
and the watch company
won't release owner info

07:44.016 --> 07:45.649
- without a court order.
- So, we can't trace it?

07:45.685 --> 07:47.651
Well, we can't, but I might know
someone who can.

07:47.687 --> 07:49.153
Why don't you give Hieronymus a call?

07:49.188 --> 07:50.688
- Hieronymus?
- Yeah, my watch guy.

07:50.723 --> 07:52.252
You have a watch guy?

07:54.359 --> 07:57.227
She's quite the little unicorn,
isn't she?

07:57.262 --> 07:58.996
You know this watch?

07:59.031 --> 08:00.731
Every horologist worth his salt

08:00.766 --> 08:03.067
knows the Petro-Robért Midnight Turbillon

08:03.102 --> 08:04.868
limited edition 2005.

08:04.904 --> 08:06.736
It's a bit of a holy grail
for collectors.

08:06.771 --> 08:08.905
- Why is that?
- Only 18 were made.

08:08.940 --> 08:10.273
None have ever hit the market.

08:10.309 --> 08:12.509
Retailed for $125,000,

08:12.544 --> 08:14.444
and probably worth twice that today.

08:14.479 --> 08:16.045
The real tragedy...

08:16.081 --> 08:18.948
it was sold into bondage
to unworthy vulgarians

08:18.983 --> 08:21.351
as door prizes for
the sacking of our economy.

08:21.386 --> 08:22.794
Door prizes?

08:22.830 --> 08:24.087
So to speak.

08:24.122 --> 08:25.755
The entire lot was purchased

08:25.790 --> 08:28.091
by some investment-banking firm in 2005

08:28.126 --> 08:30.694
as thank-you gifts for their
Mergers and Acquisition team

08:30.729 --> 08:32.596
for closing a $10-billion deal.

08:32.631 --> 08:34.664
Is that right? Do you know
the name of that firm?

08:35.734 --> 08:38.235
So I accessed DBR Capital's
public records

08:38.270 --> 08:41.035
and pulled the list of the 2005 M&A team.

08:41.071 --> 08:42.738
Most of them are either
still with the firm

08:42.773 --> 08:44.106
or at least in New York City.

08:44.140 --> 08:47.109
But one of them moved to L.A. in 2008

08:47.144 --> 08:49.177
- to start his own hedge fund.
- What's his name?

08:49.213 --> 08:51.580
Mitch Rhoads, Rhoads Investments.

08:51.616 --> 08:52.914
You know where we can find him?

08:57.455 --> 08:59.087
There!

09:02.926 --> 09:03.992
Thanks.

09:09.099 --> 09:10.825
Maybe you should let go...

09:11.702 --> 09:13.901
Maybe I should.

09:23.613 --> 09:25.747
Mr. Rhoads.

09:25.782 --> 09:27.815
I don't take stock pitches in
the parking garage,

09:27.850 --> 09:29.350
and I don't shake hands in the washroom.

09:29.386 --> 09:31.952
If you want an appointment,
call my secretary.

09:31.988 --> 09:33.854
We're not here for
stock picks, Mr. Rhoads.

09:33.890 --> 09:36.457
We think we may have something
that belongs to you.

09:40.697 --> 09:42.606
- Where'd you get it?
- Is it yours?

09:42.641 --> 09:43.998
Yeah, it is.

09:44.033 --> 09:46.167
We're private investigators.

09:46.202 --> 09:47.424
You recognize this guy?

09:47.459 --> 09:49.870
Yeah. This guy took my watch.

09:49.906 --> 09:51.272
By "took," do you mean "stole"?

09:51.307 --> 09:53.640
Actually, I lost it to him
in a poker game.

09:53.676 --> 09:55.542
Do you know where we can find him?

09:55.577 --> 09:58.112
Sorry, I don't really know the guy.

09:58.147 --> 10:00.681
Well, you knew him well enough
to lose this watch to him.

10:00.716 --> 10:02.183
Look, I got this, okay?

10:02.218 --> 10:04.185
He's a regular at the Starland game.

10:04.220 --> 10:06.954
Starland? Wait, I know that game.

10:06.989 --> 10:09.223
It's an underground poker night
made up of a-list celebs

10:09.258 --> 10:10.791
and random rich people.

10:10.827 --> 10:13.627
Yep, and your boy was there
every time I was.

10:15.364 --> 10:17.731
So I called some friends who
used to play in Starland.

10:17.766 --> 10:19.200
They told me that it's being held

10:19.235 --> 10:21.235
in the penthouse suite
at the Nouveau Hotel.

10:21.270 --> 10:23.737
- Did you find out when?
- Yes, tomorrow night.

10:23.772 --> 10:26.340
Look, even if we could get in,
we can't confront him there.

10:26.375 --> 10:28.408
I mean, a place like that is
gonna have security and muscle.

10:28.444 --> 10:30.043
We got to figure out a way to get Jackson

10:30.078 --> 10:32.178
to a neutral territory
without him rabbiting.

10:32.214 --> 10:35.081
I have an idea. Our con man
likes taking advantage

10:35.116 --> 10:36.516
of single, lonely rich girls.

10:36.552 --> 10:38.318
Maybe we should put one in his path.

10:38.997 --> 10:40.687
I don't know. You have one in mind?

10:40.723 --> 10:42.322
Me! I go to the game,

10:42.358 --> 10:44.324
I make him think that he's
charming the pants off me,

10:44.360 --> 10:47.126
and then I lure him to a neutral
place where Emily can confront him,

10:47.162 --> 10:49.529
and we can get all of Emily's money back.

10:49.565 --> 10:51.865
You really do think you're irresistible?

10:51.900 --> 10:54.100
Oh, well you sure seem to think so.

10:54.721 --> 10:55.902
Okay, then.

10:55.937 --> 10:58.004
Let's go con our con man.

11:00.925 --> 11:02.804
No, I get it. Thanks, Ben.

11:02.829 --> 11:04.928
Yeah, I appreciate it.
That's good to know.

11:04.963 --> 11:06.096
Okay, thanks, bye.

11:06.131 --> 11:07.622
- Well?
- We're in.

11:07.658 --> 11:08.965
Ben said he'll vouch for me.

11:09.001 --> 11:11.134
- Ben?
- Actor friend. Big card player.

11:11.169 --> 11:12.869
Played a brooding superhero.

11:12.904 --> 11:17.040
Oh, sometimes not dropping names
is worse than dropping names.

11:17.075 --> 11:18.241
Play starts at 10:00 P.M.

11:18.276 --> 11:20.276
It's a Hollywood game, so I'm
gonna have to change my look.

11:20.311 --> 11:22.779
If I'm too recognizable,
and someone knows I'm a P.I.,

11:22.814 --> 11:24.380
it might scare off our mark.

11:24.415 --> 11:27.216
So, what do you think? Blonde or redhead?

11:27.252 --> 11:30.720
Oh, blonde. Definitely blonde.

11:45.302 --> 11:48.103
The name's Blonde. Jane Blonde.

11:48.139 --> 11:51.173
With a license to kill.

11:51.208 --> 11:52.440
Nice bling.

11:52.476 --> 11:54.176
I borrowed it from my jewelry guy

11:54.211 --> 11:55.678
Oh, you have a jewelry guy?

11:55.713 --> 11:57.579
Yeah, well, if you want
to catch the big fish,

11:57.614 --> 11:59.048
you need the right lure.

12:01.552 --> 12:06.088
Here's your ear piece, keycard...

12:06.123 --> 12:07.355
...and our client's retainer.

12:07.391 --> 12:10.159
- Hey, try not to lose it.
- Relax.

12:10.194 --> 12:12.560
I'm actually a very good poker player.

12:12.595 --> 12:14.228
I used to clean out all my castmates

12:14.263 --> 12:15.563
during late-night shoots.

12:15.598 --> 12:17.398
Oh. Maybe we should play sometime?

12:17.433 --> 12:20.168
Oh, yeah? What are the stakes?

12:20.203 --> 12:22.170
No limit.

12:22.205 --> 12:24.538
So you think he'll hit on me, too?

12:24.574 --> 12:26.774
Well, if he doesn't, he's dead inside.

12:47.296 --> 12:49.530
This is just like "Molly's Game".

12:49.565 --> 12:50.764
Do you see our guy?

12:56.905 --> 12:58.272
Fox is in the hole.

12:58.307 --> 13:00.073
What's that supposed to be,
some kind of code?

13:00.109 --> 13:02.042
Shh, he's coming over here.

13:02.077 --> 13:03.711
- You know he can't hear me, right?
- Right.

13:03.746 --> 13:05.346
Alright, remember,
once you think you have him,

13:05.381 --> 13:07.548
bring him down to the room.
We're in 2423.

13:08.317 --> 13:10.251
That's some dress. If you came to play,

13:10.286 --> 13:11.852
I think you may have already won.

13:11.887 --> 13:15.222
I find I win more when the other
players are distracted.

13:15.258 --> 13:17.791
I see it's already working.

13:17.826 --> 13:19.359
Jack Johnston.

13:19.394 --> 13:21.026
I haven't seen you at the game before.

13:21.062 --> 13:22.862
Lexi Payton. I'm new.

13:22.897 --> 13:24.264
I just moved here from New York.

13:24.299 --> 13:26.472
- What brings you to L.A.?
- Opportunity.

13:27.769 --> 13:29.068
Looks like everybody's here.

13:29.103 --> 13:34.206
Just a reminder, it's a $10,000
buy-in, antes are $50 and $100.

13:37.078 --> 13:39.111
Players, please draw cards for seats.

13:43.251 --> 13:45.251
Oh, look at that, we're seatmates.

13:45.287 --> 13:47.887
- Must be kismet.
- Can I get you two a drink?

13:47.922 --> 13:50.222
I'll have a glass of the Chambertin 2005.

13:50.258 --> 13:52.224
And can I please get that
in a Burgundy Glass?

13:52.260 --> 13:53.384
Yes.

13:53.419 --> 13:55.093
I'll have sparkling water with lime.

13:57.264 --> 13:59.331
You're not planning on taking
advantage of me, are you?

13:59.366 --> 14:00.832
Ante up.

14:34.400 --> 14:35.900
Raise $2,000.

14:38.638 --> 14:41.105
Looks like it's just me and you, Jack.

14:41.141 --> 14:42.974
You've been playing it safe all night.

14:43.009 --> 14:45.009
You ready to make your move?

14:45.045 --> 14:46.777
How do I know you're not bluffing?

14:46.813 --> 14:48.847
There's only one way to find out.

14:51.100 --> 14:52.450
Call.

15:02.561 --> 15:04.862
Guess I wasn't bluffing.

15:04.897 --> 15:06.463
Pretty lucky night.

15:06.498 --> 15:09.258
Play your cards right,
maybe you'll get lucky, too.

15:17.442 --> 15:18.976
Sorry, guys, I need a break.

15:19.011 --> 15:20.878
Could you deal me out of this hand?

15:24.283 --> 15:25.883
Eddie. Eddie.

15:25.918 --> 15:27.851
What's the matter? Deacon just walked in.

15:27.887 --> 15:30.587
- Deacon? Did he see you?
- Yes.

15:30.622 --> 15:32.756
He's gonna blow our play.
Can you get out of there?

15:32.791 --> 15:34.992
Too late.

15:36.194 --> 15:37.494
Scotch, neat.

15:40.799 --> 15:43.332
Samantha Swift.

15:43.368 --> 15:46.770
And in disguise no less.

15:46.805 --> 15:50.072
Don't worry, whatever you're
working, I won't give you away.

15:50.108 --> 15:51.399
Why are you here?

15:51.435 --> 15:53.943
After you and your pal Eddie
sent me to prison,

15:53.978 --> 15:57.113
I was uninvited from
my regular card game.

15:57.148 --> 15:58.484
But these folks here, well,

15:58.520 --> 16:01.350
they love being able to say
that they lost a hand

16:01.386 --> 16:03.654
to an alleged crime boss.

16:05.557 --> 16:09.191
You know, but I keep telling
them that I'm innocent...

16:09.227 --> 16:12.394
but as you know, once your
reputation's been sullied,

16:12.430 --> 16:14.329
it's just so hard to repair.

16:18.302 --> 16:19.712
See you around, Sam.

16:22.306 --> 16:24.372
He's gone.

16:24.408 --> 16:26.608
Sam, we should abort.
You need to get out of there.

16:26.644 --> 16:28.410
No, the plan's working.

16:29.138 --> 16:30.612
I can do this.

16:30.648 --> 16:32.280
Well, then do it fast.

16:39.289 --> 16:40.489
Cashing out.

16:44.427 --> 16:46.126
The room's just here.

16:49.165 --> 16:51.432
Don't you just love going home a winner?

16:55.638 --> 16:57.438
- After you...
- Oh.

16:59.476 --> 17:00.508
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Put your hands up.

17:00.543 --> 17:01.776
Hands up!

17:03.546 --> 17:04.964
Emily.

17:05.752 --> 17:08.082
- You tricked me. That's right.
- How does it feel?

17:08.117 --> 17:10.451
You lied to me.
You told me that you loved me.

17:10.487 --> 17:12.419
- How could you do that?
- It was business.

17:12.454 --> 17:13.753
"Business"?

17:13.790 --> 17:17.124
It was my life. My heart.

17:17.159 --> 17:18.758
And I want it back.

17:18.794 --> 17:20.460
All the money. All the jewels.

17:20.496 --> 17:21.994
Sorry, Emily, that's not how this works.

17:22.030 --> 17:23.630
That's how it works today.

17:23.665 --> 17:25.699
So let me tell you what's gonna
happen, Jack...

17:25.733 --> 17:29.135
Or Tim, or Simon, whatever
your name really is.

17:29.170 --> 17:31.371
...first, you're going to
apologize to Miss Spear.

17:31.406 --> 17:33.473
Then you're gonna return
every cent that you took.

17:33.509 --> 17:35.441
And then you're gonna leave town.

17:35.477 --> 17:36.977
And if you don't do that,
I guess we're just gonna

17:37.012 --> 17:38.945
have to hand you over to the cops.

17:42.350 --> 17:44.784
Okay, fine. I agree.

17:44.820 --> 17:46.452
She gets her money back

17:46.488 --> 17:49.389
and her jewels and I walk free, right?

17:49.424 --> 17:51.790
Just give me the...

17:51.826 --> 17:53.358
Down! Get down!

18:02.685 --> 18:05.319
Given the trajectory of the
shot, we think the sniper fired

18:05.354 --> 18:07.221
from an empty office across the way.

18:07.256 --> 18:09.990
Uniforms are searching, but still
no sign of the sniper's nest.

18:10.025 --> 18:11.325
Who knew you were gonna be in this room?

18:11.360 --> 18:13.860
- Besides us, no one.
- Well, someone knew.

18:13.896 --> 18:15.362
Is it possible your client wanted more

18:15.398 --> 18:16.587
than just her money back?

18:16.623 --> 18:18.232
No, she didn't even know
what room we'd be in

18:18.267 --> 18:20.568
- until she got here.
- Any idea who he really is?

18:20.603 --> 18:21.988
Jessup Lance.

18:22.023 --> 18:24.171
The IDs are all fake, but his
prints are in the system.

18:24.207 --> 18:26.107
He's wanted by the feds
for multiple scams...

18:26.142 --> 18:27.896
bank fraud, wire fraud.

18:27.931 --> 18:30.177
It could be another
angry victim wanting payback.

18:30.213 --> 18:32.545
Possibly, but that still doesn't
answer the question...

18:32.581 --> 18:35.515
how did they know he was gonna
be here, in this room?

18:35.550 --> 18:36.782
Detective.

18:42.890 --> 18:44.557
Do you think it's possible
that it was someone

18:44.593 --> 18:46.068
from the card game? Deacon.

18:46.103 --> 18:47.560
Maybe, but like Chris said,

18:47.596 --> 18:49.529
how did they know that
he'd be in this room?

18:51.566 --> 18:53.366
You didn't tell her about the key.

18:53.401 --> 18:55.801
So it could disappear
into an evidence locker?

18:55.837 --> 18:58.138
You saw how he reacted when you found it.

18:58.173 --> 18:59.639
I'm thinking whatever is going on,

18:59.674 --> 19:02.475
it has something to do with this.

19:02.511 --> 19:04.777
And if want to have any hope at
getting Emily's money back,

19:04.812 --> 19:06.446
we need to find out what.

19:11.519 --> 19:13.418
According to the key's bitting code,

19:13.454 --> 19:14.987
it's to an H&R barrel lock system,

19:15.023 --> 19:16.588
commonly used for storage lockers.

19:16.624 --> 19:17.974
Yeah, and the L.W.S.?

19:18.009 --> 19:19.558
I searched Google, Yahoo, Bing.

19:19.593 --> 19:22.061
There's no L.W.S. in L.A. that
suggests the use of lockers.

19:22.096 --> 19:23.629
But honestly, it could refer to anything.

19:23.665 --> 19:25.430
Look, given the numbers
that are stamped on it,

19:25.466 --> 19:27.266
we know it's some kind of
commercial locker.

19:27.301 --> 19:29.234
And given the way that the guy
reacted when you found it,

19:29.270 --> 19:30.770
I mean, it's pretty clear
that whatever's in there,

19:30.805 --> 19:32.117
he doesn't want found.

19:32.142 --> 19:34.056
That rules out temporary
and public lockers...

19:34.092 --> 19:35.980
bus stations, airports, gyms, spas.

19:36.016 --> 19:38.638
Too much risk of someone with a master
key getting curious and accessing it.

19:38.673 --> 19:40.646
Maybe it's something he rented long-term.

19:40.681 --> 19:42.359
Ooh! Golf club or country club?

19:42.394 --> 19:44.177
If he's a member, then
he might have a locker.

19:44.213 --> 19:46.084
Yeah, except there...
there's no country clubs

19:46.119 --> 19:48.619
in the area with the initials L.W.S.

19:48.655 --> 19:50.454
Maybe a store-it-yourself facility?

19:50.490 --> 19:52.523
Well, no, most storage places,
you provide your own lock.

19:52.559 --> 19:54.234
I mean, this is a little more high-end.

19:54.269 --> 19:56.627
High end... When he ordered
his wine, he insisted

19:56.663 --> 19:58.249
that it be served in
the right kind of wine glass.

19:58.284 --> 19:59.279
Yeah, he's a wine snob.

19:59.304 --> 20:00.742
Yeah, and people who don't
have wine cellars...

20:00.778 --> 20:02.466
...sometimes store their bottles
in climate-controlled lockers

20:02.502 --> 20:03.634
at wine-storage facilities.

20:03.670 --> 20:05.737
W.S... Wine Storage.

20:09.509 --> 20:11.676
Berto, look up wine storage
places in L.A.

20:16.549 --> 20:18.316
There.

20:18.351 --> 20:19.517
La Brea Wine Storage...

20:34.367 --> 20:35.466
Bingo.

20:35.501 --> 20:37.362
- Whoa. No wonder he was anxious.
- All that must be worth...

20:37.397 --> 20:40.471
Millions. Look at this. Cash, fake IDs.

20:40.506 --> 20:42.540
That necklace. Those diamonds...

20:42.575 --> 20:44.542
Those aren't just our client's jewels.

20:44.577 --> 20:46.477
No, maybe he's run this scam before.

20:46.512 --> 20:48.846
Look, there's wire transfers,
offshore accounts.

20:48.881 --> 20:51.314
Maybe we can use these
to trace Emily's money.

20:57.589 --> 20:58.722
Hey!

20:58.758 --> 21:00.023
Hey.

21:01.526 --> 21:02.993
Get the bag.

21:03.028 --> 21:05.662
Eddie, are you okay?!
Eddie, are you all right?

21:06.899 --> 21:08.565
Oh, my God.

21:13.806 --> 21:15.338
You know, you don't have
to take care of me.

21:15.374 --> 21:16.874
Be quiet.

21:16.909 --> 21:20.343
I know I'm not a doctor,
but I have played one on TV.

21:20.379 --> 21:22.002
Who do you think those guys were?

21:22.037 --> 21:23.913
I don't know, but they were waiting.

21:23.948 --> 21:26.015
And they must've followed us
to get that duffel.

21:26.050 --> 21:27.629
You think one of them is the shooter?

21:27.664 --> 21:29.786
Could be, or someone connected
to the shooter.

21:29.821 --> 21:31.376
If they killed Jessup,

21:31.412 --> 21:33.790
this is about more than
just stolen jewelry.

21:33.825 --> 21:36.056
- We need to tell Christine.
- Tell her what?

21:36.092 --> 21:37.327
That we lied to her about the key?

21:37.362 --> 21:39.350
We got jumped and we
lost crucial evidence.

21:39.386 --> 21:41.063
Look, I'd rather just take a
minute and try to figure out

21:41.099 --> 21:42.398
who did this first.

21:42.433 --> 21:43.732
How are we gonna do that?

21:43.973 --> 21:45.406
There's plenty of traffic cams
in the area.

21:45.441 --> 21:47.008
I'm sure Berto will be
able to find that car

21:47.043 --> 21:48.499
and pull the plates.

21:48.759 --> 21:49.810
Ooh.

21:49.845 --> 21:51.211
- Ooh. Sorry.
- It's okay.

21:51.246 --> 21:53.147
That's not the first time
I've been jumped.

21:53.182 --> 21:56.317
Well, it's not even the first
time this week.

22:09.565 --> 22:11.665
This is a bad idea.

22:11.700 --> 22:13.867
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

22:13.903 --> 22:15.969
- Last time.
- Okay.

22:34.353 --> 22:36.032
_

22:43.665 --> 22:45.197
Hey, what's up, Chris?

22:45.232 --> 22:48.634
Hey. Uh, you think you could
meet me at the morgue?

22:48.670 --> 22:50.269
There's something I need to show you.

22:51.673 --> 22:54.740
I just got my life together again.

22:54.776 --> 22:58.343
And now you're asking me to take
a wrecking ball to everything?

22:59.361 --> 23:01.572
I can't believe this.

23:03.282 --> 23:05.885
Why did you have to show up now?

23:13.194 --> 23:15.894
Sam, you just blew us away.

23:15.929 --> 23:18.163
Look, you made Sara cry.

23:18.199 --> 23:21.008
Thanks? Sorry, Sara.

23:22.069 --> 23:25.370
So if you want it, the part's yours.

23:38.085 --> 23:39.851
Uh-oh. You look serious.

23:39.886 --> 23:41.853
Did I do something wrong?

23:41.888 --> 23:43.521
We found something.

23:47.761 --> 23:49.060
Eddie.

23:49.924 --> 23:51.763
Tell him.

23:51.798 --> 23:53.397
We just got back the ballistics report.

23:53.433 --> 23:58.569
The round that killed your con
artist was from a .338 Magnum.

23:58.605 --> 24:00.404
It's not your typical
civilian ammunition.

24:00.440 --> 24:03.141
It's favored by military and mercenaries.

24:03.176 --> 24:06.044
The LAPD Firearms Analysis Unit

24:06.079 --> 24:08.780
analyzed the striations on the slug,

24:08.815 --> 24:12.083
and they found a match in the system...

24:12.119 --> 24:14.985
to an unsolved homicide
from three years ago.

24:15.021 --> 24:16.987
Chris...

24:17.023 --> 24:18.956
I'm sorry, Eddie.

24:18.991 --> 24:22.059
But the weapon the shooter
used to kill Jessup Lance...

24:22.094 --> 24:24.895
It's the same one that killed
your friend, Marnie Stahr.

24:35.015 --> 24:36.981
Monica, I have the most amazing news.

24:37.017 --> 24:38.282
I don't think now's the best time.

24:38.318 --> 24:39.435
Did something happen?

24:39.471 --> 24:40.851
You better ask Eddie.

24:46.643 --> 24:47.808
There's been another victim?

24:47.843 --> 24:50.144
Yeah, a client of mine.

24:50.180 --> 24:51.879
Killed three years ago.

24:51.914 --> 24:53.514
While I was protecting her.

24:55.652 --> 24:57.251
Marnie Stahr.

24:59.989 --> 25:01.621
She was a human-rights lawyer

25:01.657 --> 25:03.956
working a number of high-profile cases.

25:03.992 --> 25:05.925
She must've made the wrong people angry

25:05.960 --> 25:07.827
because she started to get death threats.

25:07.862 --> 25:09.996
She hired me to investigate.

25:10.031 --> 25:12.131
But the threats, they kept getting worse.

25:12.167 --> 25:15.902
So I put her on
round-the-clock protection.

25:16.582 --> 25:18.215
How did it happen?

25:21.176 --> 25:22.909
She'd been holed up in a hotel for a week

25:22.944 --> 25:25.412
and just wanted to get some air.

25:25.447 --> 25:28.181
Talked me into letting her go out...

25:31.386 --> 25:33.894
We were in a city park.

25:33.930 --> 25:36.476
There's no way anyone could've
known we were there.

25:38.992 --> 25:42.361
She wanted me to buy some
ice cream so I'd lighten up.

25:59.079 --> 26:01.380
I didn't even see where
the shot came from.

26:08.055 --> 26:10.218
She died in my arms.

26:11.091 --> 26:13.430
I never found the shooter.

26:14.094 --> 26:16.061
She was more than just a client.

26:23.036 --> 26:25.203
I couldn't protect her.

26:25.239 --> 26:26.671
But now I have a chance to find

26:26.706 --> 26:29.040
the guy who did this and put him away.

26:29.076 --> 26:31.042
I mean, these cases,
they have to be connected.

26:31.078 --> 26:33.078
I just need to figure out how.

26:33.113 --> 26:36.882
What if they're connected,
but not like you think?

26:36.917 --> 26:39.350
What are the odds that the man
you were standing next to

26:39.386 --> 26:41.253
in the hotel room
would be shot by the same

26:41.288 --> 26:43.021
exact weapon as Marnie Stahr.

26:43.056 --> 26:45.890
Okay, that just can't be a coincidence.

26:45.925 --> 26:49.059
And Deacon being at that same
hotel at that game,

26:49.095 --> 26:50.203
what if he's behind this,

26:50.238 --> 26:52.096
and he's dangling
Marnie's murder as bait.

26:52.131 --> 26:54.599
- Bait for what?
- He wants to destroy you...

26:54.634 --> 26:57.802
or... or both of us...
for what we did to him.

26:57.837 --> 27:00.638
Maybe he's behind this and
he's... he's playing us somehow.

27:00.674 --> 27:02.129
What if he is, Sam? So, what,

27:02.164 --> 27:04.742
are we supposed to sit back
and let him get away with it?

27:04.778 --> 27:06.977
What if this is the way
to finally get him?

27:07.013 --> 27:08.145
To beat him at his own game?

27:08.181 --> 27:09.510
My eyes are wide open.

27:09.546 --> 27:12.049
Well, it doesn't matter
if you're blinded by emotion.

27:12.084 --> 27:13.951
All I know is that her shooter
is still out there,

27:13.986 --> 27:16.120
and I have a chance to finally find him.

27:16.155 --> 27:17.689
To finally end this thing.

27:19.359 --> 27:20.625
What does Christine think?

27:20.660 --> 27:22.126
What she always thinks.

27:22.161 --> 27:24.161
That I should stay out of it
and let the cops handle it.

27:24.197 --> 27:26.130
Yeah, well, she's right this time.
You need to sit this one out.

27:26.165 --> 27:27.497
Sit this out?

27:27.533 --> 27:29.133
You're kidding, right?

27:29.168 --> 27:31.135
- Do I sound like I'm kidding?
- Three years, Sam!

27:31.170 --> 27:33.570
Three years I have looked for a lead.

27:33.605 --> 27:35.306
I finally have one!

27:35.341 --> 27:36.773
I mean, how can you not get that?

27:36.809 --> 27:38.442
Oh, I get it.

27:38.477 --> 27:41.111
Okay, you want to ride into
battle on your white horse,

27:41.147 --> 27:42.612
and you want to destroy a person

27:42.648 --> 27:45.015
who killed someone that you cared about.

27:45.051 --> 27:47.517
That is who you are. I know that.

27:47.553 --> 27:48.752
And so does Deacon.

27:48.787 --> 27:51.027
We don't even know that he's involved!

27:51.523 --> 27:53.157
All this talk about us being partners

27:53.192 --> 27:54.195
and you're not gonna back me on this?

27:54.230 --> 27:55.459
Not when you're being stupid!

27:55.494 --> 27:57.193
When have I ever not had your back?

27:57.229 --> 27:59.929
I'm trying to protect you, okay?

27:59.965 --> 28:02.332
I don't want to see you
get hurt... or dead.

28:02.368 --> 28:03.433
Yeah, well, I can take care of myself.

28:03.469 --> 28:06.603
I've been doing it since
long before you showed up.

28:06.638 --> 28:08.338
So if you don't want to back me on this,

28:08.374 --> 28:09.973
then I don't want you around.

28:25.190 --> 28:27.190
Berto, any luck finding
the guys who jumped me?

28:27.225 --> 28:28.458
What the hell are you doing?

28:28.494 --> 28:30.226
- What?
- Pushing her away like that.

28:30.262 --> 28:32.028
She's been the best thing
to happen to you in years.

28:32.063 --> 28:34.488
Did you find the car or not?

28:35.200 --> 28:37.657
I pulled traffic-cam footage
from the city system.

28:38.669 --> 28:40.370
Caught this nearby
right after you were jumped.

28:40.405 --> 28:41.837
That's the car. You run it?

28:41.873 --> 28:43.539
Yeah.

28:43.574 --> 28:45.508
It's registered to a Jimmy Dante.

28:45.543 --> 28:46.842
That's him.

28:46.878 --> 28:48.128
Eddie, he's mob.

28:48.163 --> 28:50.313
Dante's an enforcer for
the Spolano crime family.

28:50.348 --> 28:52.148
Great. Find him.

28:58.356 --> 28:59.749
The conflict was inevitable.

28:59.785 --> 29:01.589
Both of your emotional states
were already heightened.

29:01.625 --> 29:04.159
- Why do you say that?
- Because obviously you slept together,

29:04.194 --> 29:05.360
which means there's more at stake.

29:05.396 --> 29:07.298
- How'd you know that?
- It's why you're so upset with him.

29:07.333 --> 29:09.831
No, I'm not upset <i> with</i> him.
I'm upset <i> for</i> him.

29:09.866 --> 29:11.733
He blames himself for this woman's death,

29:11.768 --> 29:13.068
but it wasn't his fault!

29:13.103 --> 29:14.436
Which makes him vulnerable.

29:14.471 --> 29:15.913
He is walking into a trap,

29:15.949 --> 29:18.673
and I need to find a way
to prove it before he does.

29:36.326 --> 29:37.592
Emily!

29:37.627 --> 29:39.226
- Oh, Sam.
- Hey.

29:39.262 --> 29:41.563
God, I'm still so rattled
from the other night.

29:41.598 --> 29:44.098
Hey, have you had any
movement on the case?

29:44.133 --> 29:45.967
Oh, we have some promising leads.

29:46.002 --> 29:47.329
I just... I wanted to ask you something.

29:47.365 --> 29:49.537
I'm curious. How did you
come to hire our agency?

29:49.573 --> 29:50.905
Did someone recommend you to us?

29:50.941 --> 29:52.774
Yes, it was an old colleague of mine.

29:52.809 --> 29:54.876
I was confiding in her
about what was going on,

29:54.911 --> 29:57.078
and she said she had heard
good things about you two.

29:57.113 --> 29:58.613
What's her name? I'd like to thank her.

29:58.648 --> 29:59.714
Evelyn.

29:59.749 --> 30:02.383
- Evelyn Collette.
- Thanks, Emily.

30:02.418 --> 30:04.327
I-I'll let you know
if we find out anything.

30:05.822 --> 30:07.054
Sam...

30:07.090 --> 30:08.322
Evelyn Collette.

30:08.358 --> 30:09.757
Her maiden name is Chambers.

30:09.793 --> 30:12.292
As in Judge Noah B. Chambers?

30:12.327 --> 30:14.060
She's Deacon's sister.

30:26.675 --> 30:29.309
Remember me? Drive.

30:36.275 --> 30:38.875
You took the wrong guy, pal.

30:38.911 --> 30:40.510
Do you have any idea who I am?

30:40.546 --> 30:43.447
I know exactly who you are,
and I took you anyway.

30:43.482 --> 30:45.649
If I were you, that would scare me.

30:50.222 --> 30:54.425
Jessup Lance. Killed with
a .338 Magnum at 200 yards.

30:54.460 --> 30:56.212
Oh, I had nothing to do with that.

31:00.165 --> 31:03.500
I wasn't done.

31:05.003 --> 31:07.036
You see, I know all about you, Jimmy.

31:07.072 --> 31:09.439
Arson. Racketeering.

31:09.475 --> 31:12.442
Key suspect in some gangland
slayings. All at close range.

31:12.478 --> 31:14.644
But a shot like that, 200 yards?

31:14.680 --> 31:16.312
That takes skill.

31:16.348 --> 31:18.247
Skills you don't have.

31:18.283 --> 31:20.116
You didn't take that shot.

31:20.151 --> 31:22.586
I want to know who did.

31:22.621 --> 31:24.488
You're not a cop.

31:24.523 --> 31:26.623
Why would you even care about him?

31:26.658 --> 31:29.593
Him? You think I care about him?

31:29.628 --> 31:31.628
This guy's a lowlife, okay?

31:31.663 --> 31:33.129
He had it coming!

31:35.266 --> 31:36.711
She didn't.

31:37.602 --> 31:39.135
Look at her.

31:39.170 --> 31:41.237
This is who I care about.

31:41.272 --> 31:44.907
Three years ago, she was killed
by the same gunman.

31:47.312 --> 31:49.112
So this is personal?

31:49.147 --> 31:51.180
Oh, yeah, this is personal.

31:51.216 --> 31:53.349
So let me tell you how it is.

31:53.385 --> 31:55.084
Right now, you are the only thing

31:55.120 --> 31:56.519
standing between me and him.

31:56.554 --> 31:58.654
And I am a freight train.

31:58.689 --> 32:02.125
So you can sit here and get obliterated,

32:02.160 --> 32:03.959
or get off the tracks.

32:06.731 --> 32:07.795
Where's Eddie?

32:07.830 --> 32:08.916
I've been trying him,
but he won't answer.

32:08.952 --> 32:10.632
He's running down
the guy that jumped you.

32:10.667 --> 32:12.434
- The guy's a mobster.
- And he went after him alone?

32:12.469 --> 32:14.636
I tried stopping him,
but he's not thinking clearly.

32:14.671 --> 32:15.803
He's gonna get himself killed.

32:15.839 --> 32:17.172
Berto, this mobster, do you know

32:17.207 --> 32:18.873
if he has any connection to Deacon?

32:18.909 --> 32:20.942
I'm not sure. Christine would know.

32:23.713 --> 32:24.846
The Spolanos?

32:24.881 --> 32:27.615
Yeah, they have a stranglehold
on the Long Beach docks.

32:27.651 --> 32:30.885
Word is, Deacon's organization employed
them to bring product into the States.

32:30.921 --> 32:32.987
- So they're connected.
- Sam, what's going on?

32:33.023 --> 32:34.022
Eddie's in trouble.

32:34.058 --> 32:36.525
I think he's being set up.
Berto, we need to find him.

32:36.560 --> 32:37.692
Can you track his phone?

32:39.729 --> 32:42.697
We were hunting Jessup Lance for months.

32:42.732 --> 32:45.967
He pulled the same con on
Old Man Spolano's daughter.

32:46.002 --> 32:48.636
Middle of planning the wedding.

32:48.672 --> 32:50.471
He took her for nearly a mil.

32:50.506 --> 32:53.374
We finally got a tip that
he was gonna be at the game.

32:53.409 --> 32:56.010
Had it all set up to take him
down to the river.

32:56.046 --> 32:59.213
And then we found out
that you were on the case.

32:59.248 --> 33:01.749
So the old man worried
that Jessup would wind up

33:01.785 --> 33:04.418
in police protection
and we'd lose our shot.

33:04.454 --> 33:07.088
So we asked a friend
to recommend a specialist.

33:07.123 --> 33:08.756
Someone outside the family.

33:08.792 --> 33:10.592
Someone who wouldn't come back
to our doorstep.

33:10.627 --> 33:12.293
Contract killer.

33:14.529 --> 33:16.763
Karl Kahn.

33:16.799 --> 33:21.534
Odds are, if he killed your
girl, someone paid him to do it.

33:25.540 --> 33:26.773
Where can I find him?

35:48.913 --> 35:51.047
Why'd you kill her? Huh? Why?

35:51.082 --> 35:54.150
Who paid you? Who paid you?

35:54.185 --> 35:55.585
Who wanted her dead?!

35:55.621 --> 35:56.886
Put it down, Eddie! Now!

35:56.921 --> 35:58.821
I can't, Chris. He's the one.

35:58.857 --> 36:01.524
He was paid to kill her. All
the evidence is upstairs.

36:13.962 --> 36:16.340
Mr. Kahn, I'll ask you again.

36:16.375 --> 36:19.065
What's your connection to Jessup Lance?

36:20.136 --> 36:22.035
To Marnie Stahr?

36:24.979 --> 36:27.880
Tell me about the explosion
that took out your apartment.

36:31.820 --> 36:33.920
Let me ask you a question.

36:33.955 --> 36:36.255
Are you gonna charge me with something?

36:38.827 --> 36:40.658
Because your time's almost up.

36:54.641 --> 36:56.708
- He's not talking...
- Chris, he's baiting us, okay?

36:56.743 --> 36:59.010
- He's the guy.
- I've got nothing on him.

36:59.046 --> 37:01.046
Whatever proof you had was
destroyed in the explosion.

37:01.081 --> 37:02.347
He blew up his own apartment.

37:02.382 --> 37:03.681
Can't you hold him on arson?

37:03.717 --> 37:06.017
According to the arson unit, all
the evidence points to a gas leak.

37:06.053 --> 37:07.830
Because he staged it to look like one!

37:07.865 --> 37:09.157
Chris, he killed Marnie.

37:09.192 --> 37:10.519
Eddie, I'm sorry.

37:10.554 --> 37:13.524
I can't hold him any longer.
I got to cut him loose.

37:15.914 --> 37:17.080
We can't let him walk!

37:17.115 --> 37:18.715
There's got to be something
we can do to keep him here.

37:18.750 --> 37:20.817
At least until we can build a case.

37:20.852 --> 37:23.119
Eddie, Eddie, you're spinning, okay?
This is what Deacon wants.

37:23.154 --> 37:25.387
What you need to do is walk away.

37:25.423 --> 37:27.590
So he can disappear
and slip away forever?

37:27.625 --> 37:28.858
If that book is any indication,

37:28.893 --> 37:30.459
he's killed at least a dozen people.

37:32.230 --> 37:33.863
Better luck next time.

37:33.898 --> 37:35.064
What'd you say?

37:35.100 --> 37:36.365
Let him go, Eddie!

37:36.400 --> 37:38.935
Eddie, come on! Stop it!
You could kill him!

37:44.042 --> 37:45.507
I need some air.

37:56.554 --> 37:57.753
Sam?

37:57.788 --> 37:58.954
It's late.

37:58.989 --> 38:00.922
You just took off.

38:00.958 --> 38:02.924
Yeah.

38:02.960 --> 38:07.028
Yeah, I just needed to walk, to think.

38:09.800 --> 38:11.767
You know, you were right.

38:11.802 --> 38:14.035
I shouldn't have gone after it.

38:14.071 --> 38:15.571
I lost control.

38:15.606 --> 38:18.206
I did things I promised myself
I would never do.

38:21.011 --> 38:23.411
I thought I was past all this.

38:23.446 --> 38:24.880
You know, sometimes,

38:24.915 --> 38:26.948
even though you're done with feelings,

38:26.984 --> 38:29.651
they're not necessarily done with you.

38:29.686 --> 38:32.720
Which is why I usually try to avoid them.

38:42.432 --> 38:44.065
What are we doing, Sam?

38:44.101 --> 38:46.034
I have no idea.

38:48.272 --> 38:50.738
And it's way more complicated now.

38:57.681 --> 39:00.948
Hey, you... you had an audition.

39:00.983 --> 39:03.750
How'd it go?

39:03.786 --> 39:05.953
We don't need to talk about that now.

39:05.988 --> 39:08.037
You got the part.

39:09.025 --> 39:10.581
I did.

39:11.060 --> 39:14.428
It's the lead,
the break I was hoping for.

39:14.463 --> 39:16.530
You're gonna take it, right?

39:16.565 --> 39:19.799
I haven't... yet.

39:24.640 --> 39:26.347
I can't do both.

39:27.710 --> 39:29.343
I know.

39:31.981 --> 39:33.947
So where does that leave us?

39:55.870 --> 39:56.961
Mick?

39:58.707 --> 40:01.375
He was beaten, he was tortured,

40:01.410 --> 40:03.042
and he was shot close range.

40:03.078 --> 40:05.846
- Chris, there was a witness.
- Who?

40:05.881 --> 40:07.881
- Detective Rollins.
- Lieutenant.

40:07.916 --> 40:10.483
Uniforms found a hidden camera,
part of a wildlife survey.

40:10.518 --> 40:11.817
They were able to pull video.

40:11.853 --> 40:13.386
I need you to take a look.

40:29.570 --> 40:32.005
Chris, that license plate...

40:32.040 --> 40:33.606
that's Eddie's car.

40:44.584 --> 40:45.951
Hello?

40:45.986 --> 40:47.052
Hello, Eddie.

40:54.061 --> 40:55.227
Deacon?

40:55.262 --> 40:57.029
It was nice to see Sam the other night.

40:57.064 --> 40:59.464
It was good to see the two
of you are doing so well.

40:59.499 --> 41:01.633
Why are you calling?

41:01.668 --> 41:03.936
Just checking in on my old pal.

41:03.971 --> 41:05.804
Hey, that case the two
of you were working,

41:05.839 --> 41:06.939
how did that turn out?

41:06.974 --> 41:08.240
It turned out just fine.

41:08.275 --> 41:11.076
Did it, now? That's nice to hear.

41:13.347 --> 41:15.623
Sam has a new movie.

41:16.149 --> 41:17.916
She must be thrilled.

41:17.951 --> 41:20.051
- What do you want? Huh?
- That's funny.

41:20.086 --> 41:22.554
When the two of you sent me to prison,

41:22.589 --> 41:24.823
I asked myself that same question...

41:24.858 --> 41:26.057
what do I want?

41:27.594 --> 41:29.126
Well, Eddie,

41:29.162 --> 41:33.197
prison has a way of clarifying things.

41:35.101 --> 41:36.734
Making them simple.

41:38.872 --> 41:41.973
Oddly enough,
at this particular moment...

41:48.348 --> 41:50.574
...I have everything I want.

41:51.217 --> 41:53.717
What?

41:55.788 --> 41:57.989
LAPD! Open up!

41:58.024 --> 41:59.357
What? What's happening?

41:59.392 --> 42:00.491
I don't know.

42:04.730 --> 42:06.097
Hey! Hey!

42:06.132 --> 42:08.732
Step back, Valetik.
Hands where I can see 'em.

42:11.137 --> 42:12.269
Chris, what's happening?

42:12.305 --> 42:13.471
What's going on?

42:15.174 --> 42:17.941
Eddie Valetik, you're under arrest...

42:20.313 --> 42:22.679
...for the murder of Karl Kahn.

42:23.305 --> 42:29.180
