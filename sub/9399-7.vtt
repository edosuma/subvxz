<i>NARRATOR: Previously on</i> One Tree Hill.

00:05.271 --> 00:06.966
You're dismissing me from my own band.

00:07.040 --> 00:10.737
Yes, only it's not your band anymore.
I just kicked you out.

00:10.810 --> 00:11.936
Mia, let's go.

00:12.012 --> 00:14.640
- I think I'm gonna stay.
- You're an idiot.

00:14.714 --> 00:18.013
I'm gonna head home.
I'm not feeling very well.

00:18.952 --> 00:21.420
Then maybe you're not
on-air material after all.

00:21.488 --> 00:23.547
- Don't get mad at Lindsey.
- No, I'm not mad at her.

00:23.623 --> 00:25.750
- You sound mad at her.
- Maybe I just don't like her.

00:25.825 --> 00:27.156
Well, you don't have to...

00:30.230 --> 00:31.527
I'm gonna go, Haley.

00:31.598 --> 00:33.429
I wanna pay rent.
I don't know how I'm gonna do it,

00:33.500 --> 00:35.058
but I'll figure it out, I just...

00:35.135 --> 00:37.968
Whatever this is, I don't feel right about it.

00:38.038 --> 00:41.769
Carrie, could you not
wear a bikini in the pool?

01:07.734 --> 01:09.531
All right, guys, bring it in.

01:09.602 --> 01:12.867
It has been way too long
since we all hung out together.

01:12.939 --> 01:14.770
And this is the first time we're all

01:14.841 --> 01:20.302
drinking together. Legally, that is.
So here's to hanging with our crew.

01:20.480 --> 01:22.846
The old and the new.

01:23.650 --> 01:26.448
And to everyone getting what they want.

01:26.519 --> 01:28.953
HALEY: Guess one shot won't kill us, huh?

01:33.893 --> 01:36.589
- PEYTON: Maybe it will.
- Brooke, what was that?

01:36.663 --> 01:38.824
I wanted something
that would remind everyone of me,

01:38.898 --> 01:41.366
so they mixed their most popular liquor

01:41.434 --> 01:43.732
with their sweetest.
The bartender did name

01:43.803 --> 01:49.241
- it a Brooke Davis. Isn't that right?
- Actually, I think you named it that.

01:49.309 --> 01:52.005
- Well.
- I call it tequila and grenadine.

01:52.245 --> 01:54.179
- It's disgusting.
- OWEN: Yeah.

01:56.850 --> 02:00.149
You know, not many people
can handle a Brooke Davis.

02:00.220 --> 02:02.484
Well, it's definitely one of a kind.

02:09.529 --> 02:12.896
I don't know about the old crew,
but the new crew's ready to go home.

02:12.966 --> 02:15.366
We just got here. I thought
you wanted to see the Honorary Title.

02:15.435 --> 02:18.632
I thought I could handle being around
Peyton, who hates me by the way,

02:18.705 --> 02:22.038
- but I was wrong.
- Look, Tric's a big place, okay?

02:22.108 --> 02:25.737
- Avoiding her shouldn't be too difficult.
- Oh, I'll have no problem avoiding her.

02:25.812 --> 02:27.939
It's you I'm worried about.

02:32.318 --> 02:34.115
HALEY: Thank you.
OWEN: Here you go.

02:34.187 --> 02:36.883
- Water?
- I wasn't planning on drinking

02:36.956 --> 02:39.754
until Brooke forced herself on us.

02:39.826 --> 02:41.054
(LAUGHS)

02:42.095 --> 02:44.996
It's my turn to be responsible for a change.

02:45.865 --> 02:48.800
You know, you've really come
a long way in the last month

02:48.868 --> 02:50.631
and I'm glad to have you back.
So is Jamie.

02:50.703 --> 02:54.002
Oh, really. How come I wasn't invited
to hang out with him and the guys then?

02:54.073 --> 02:56.633
See, Skills has been really strict
about this no-parent rule and

02:56.709 --> 03:00.304
besides, Jamie's sleepover means
you and I have the house to ourselves

03:00.380 --> 03:05.613
- for a little private after-party.
- My own personal champagne room?

03:05.685 --> 03:08.483
Yeah. Except you're the stripper.

03:09.489 --> 03:11.855
- Jack and Coke, bro.
- You got it.

03:12.725 --> 03:15.819
Coach and teach.
What y'all two doing here, man, huh?

03:15.895 --> 03:18.056
We should be asking you the same thing.

03:18.131 --> 03:21.897
Me? I'm just taking a study break
from <i>Les Mis.</i>

03:22.268 --> 03:25.431
Well, don't stay out too late.
We got an early-morning practice.

03:25.505 --> 03:28.303
All work and no player? Come on, man.

03:28.474 --> 03:31.739
- Ain't I been on time for every practice?
- Yeah, you have been good.

03:31.811 --> 03:34.905
What can I say, man?
I'm learning from the best.

03:35.448 --> 03:39.179
You could learn a lot more
from Nathan than just basketball.

03:45.391 --> 03:46.756
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:47.026 --> 03:48.516
- Thanks for the invite.
- Yeah.

03:48.595 --> 03:50.722
I'm usually at home online
on Saturday nights.

03:50.797 --> 03:52.992
Okay, we're gonna have to work
on your rock-star image.

03:53.066 --> 03:54.090
Well, this should help.

03:54.167 --> 03:55.759
I can't tell you how much
I love the Honorary Title.

03:55.835 --> 03:58.861
Oh, good. How would you like to open
for them?

03:59.606 --> 04:03.667
- When? Tonight?
- Yeah. It's one song, okay?

04:03.743 --> 04:06.439
One song to open up and I didn't
even have to unbutton a button.

04:06.512 --> 04:09.504
Why didn't you give me any notice?
I'm not ready, I look awful.

04:09.582 --> 04:10.606
I don't even have a band, Peyton.

04:10.683 --> 04:11.945
All right, this is why I didn't tell you.

04:12.018 --> 04:14.919
'Cause I was scared you were going
to run off and disappear on me again.

04:15.021 --> 04:17.454
But you look great.
You can warm up in my office

04:17.523 --> 04:21.185
- and the house band will back you.
- I hate you.

04:26.199 --> 04:28.599
- Hey. Where have you been?
- I was closing the store

04:28.668 --> 04:31.432
when Victoria came in
and made me take inventory.

04:31.504 --> 04:33.904
Don't get upset, but I may have let it slip
that I was meeting you here.

04:33.973 --> 04:35.497
It's fine, we have more important things
to worry about

04:35.575 --> 04:38.840
like a big date tonight.
Now I think you look great,

04:38.911 --> 04:41.846
but we need an impartial opinion.
Hey, Owen.

04:44.150 --> 04:45.708
Yeah, yeah. Hi, hi. How does she look?

04:45.785 --> 04:49.277
Hot, right? She's wearing
a Clothes Over Bro's original.

04:49.355 --> 04:52.347
- You're the prettiest girl in the room.
- Did you hear that, Millie?

04:52.425 --> 04:54.689
You're the second-prettiest girl
in the room.

04:54.761 --> 04:56.695
I can't wait to see the look
on Mouth's face when he finds out

04:56.763 --> 04:59.926
- he's on a date with you.
- He doesn't know it's a date?

04:59.999 --> 05:02.433
Relax. Owen doesn't know
we're on a date either,

05:02.502 --> 05:05.471
but that's not stopping me. Hey, Owen...

05:07.240 --> 05:08.468
Thanks.

05:18.117 --> 05:20.347
- Hey, you.
- Hey. You look nice.

05:20.420 --> 05:23.583
Oh, thanks, but I keep thinking
it's going to fall off.

05:23.656 --> 05:24.953
(LAUGHS)

05:25.124 --> 05:28.423
- Where's Haley?
- I think she's in the ladies' room.

05:29.062 --> 05:30.256
Hey. Two shots.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.127
- How's tequila?
- Good.

05:33.399 --> 05:35.264
I'm not drinking tonight.

05:35.335 --> 05:38.099
Do you need to use the ladies' room, too?

05:38.738 --> 05:42.299
- I'm trying to be good.
- Oh. I'm not.

05:47.647 --> 05:48.705
Mm.

06:00.660 --> 06:03.288
- What's this?
- Rent. Sorry, it's late.

06:03.429 --> 06:06.364
- You don't have to do that.
- No, I really do.

06:06.966 --> 06:11.335
- Well, I'm not taking it.
- Fine. I'll mail it.

06:14.874 --> 06:18.139
- What was that about?
- She had a rent check for me.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.505
- I didn't take it.
- Why not?

06:20.780 --> 06:22.873
I don't feel right accepting money
from Peyton, all right?

06:22.949 --> 06:24.883
We've been friends for too long.

06:24.951 --> 06:28.011
Hate to break it to you, but most guys
aren't friends with their exes.

06:28.087 --> 06:31.682
Peyton's different. Look, I know
I said we could try avoiding her,

06:31.758 --> 06:34.727
but maybe we should work this thing out.

06:34.961 --> 06:39.125
- At least say something to her?
- Fine, let's go.

06:44.103 --> 06:46.037
You know when you said
you don't like me?

06:46.105 --> 06:49.563
Well, I don't like you either. There.
I said something.

07:13.166 --> 07:16.363
- You gonna order a Brooke Davis?
- Lf only it were that easy.

07:16.436 --> 07:20.031
I brought you a present. It's over there,
wrapped in green and you should ask

07:20.106 --> 07:23.940
- very nicely before you try to unwrap it.
- Brooke, I don't know. I...

07:24.010 --> 07:26.240
What, are you seeing someone?

07:26.679 --> 07:30.615
- No, I... Well, I mean...
- Darling, that was rhetorical. Come on.

07:32.685 --> 07:35.916
Mouth, Millie, Millie, Mouth. Fall in love,

07:35.988 --> 07:40.687
get married, invite me to the wedding
and sit me next to a really hot guy.

07:41.160 --> 07:43.720
Um, we met at the Clothes Over Bro's
opening, right?

07:43.796 --> 07:46.060
- You're Brooke's assistant.
- Yeah. Millicent.

07:46.132 --> 07:49.067
Well, that's a great job.
I mean, I was pretty much her assistant

07:49.135 --> 07:50.796
in high school. So...

07:50.870 --> 07:51.996
(LAUGHING)

07:52.071 --> 07:55.165
Hey. You lightened your hair.
It looks awesome.

07:55.241 --> 07:58.335
- Thanks. You and Nathan look great, too.
- Oh, thanks.

07:58.411 --> 08:01.403
- Must be nice to have him up and walking.
- Yes, really, I think I was more excited

08:01.481 --> 08:05.212
about his first steps than I was Jamie's.
Which is terrible.

08:05.618 --> 08:09.645
So how're you doing? Are you still upset
about that Peyton thing?

08:09.889 --> 08:12.722
Not as upset as I am that Lucas snuck off
to see her the other night.

08:12.792 --> 08:14.419
He did not. Why?

08:14.694 --> 08:17.390
Haven't asked.
I'm not so sure I want to know.

08:17.463 --> 08:21.263
- You should ask him. It's probably nothing.
- I know. It's just...

08:21.334 --> 08:24.394
Suddenly, everything we do involves
Peyton somehow.

08:24.470 --> 08:26.461
- Well, that's not true.
- Hey, I'm sorry.

08:26.539 --> 08:28.200
Whenever you get a second
I need to talk to you, okay?

08:28.274 --> 08:29.764
Sure.

08:31.944 --> 08:34.275
- Well, maybe it's a little true.
- Huh.

08:34.914 --> 08:37.075
QUENTIN: (CHUCKLING) Uh huh.

08:39.284 --> 08:41.947
All right. That better not be yours.

08:42.355 --> 08:47.156
Oh, no, man. That ain't mine. I don't
even drink shots. Please. I'm more of a...

08:48.728 --> 08:51.697
- I'm not old enough.
- Well, then whose is it?

08:52.164 --> 08:54.962
Oh. That's mine.
Just walked away for a second.

08:55.034 --> 08:57.901
Walking away. Sounds like a good idea.

09:00.640 --> 09:02.437
- Lucas, right?
- Yeah.

09:03.009 --> 09:04.601
This is for you.

09:13.886 --> 09:18.255
- Why are women so screwed up?
- Let me guess. Peyton.

09:18.558 --> 09:19.582
How'd you know?

09:19.659 --> 09:21.854
'Cause she sent you a drink
with a check in it.

09:21.928 --> 09:25.420
Yeah, we're having a tough time
with the whole "friends" thing.

09:25.498 --> 09:28.467
- How did you two do it so easily?
- I make everything look easy.

09:28.534 --> 09:31.264
- Nate.
- Peyton and I were never in love.

09:31.837 --> 09:36.467
- Yeah, well, Lindsey's mad at me, too.
- Yet you seem more upset about Peyton.

09:37.577 --> 09:40.137
- I'm gonna go find Lindsey.
- All right.

09:44.250 --> 09:47.447
- Oh, you bought me a drink?
- Not exactly.

09:48.220 --> 09:51.246
- What were you and Lucas talking about?
- Exes.

09:52.158 --> 09:54.058
Girlfriends or wives?

me to Scientology. And then she goes
to get me a cape and I am crawling

- out the window.
- Well, at least you go on dates.

10:15.414 --> 10:17.939

so they can meet Brooke Davis.

10:18.017 --> 10:20.679

10:39.438 --> 10:40.666
Thanks.

10:42.808 --> 10:44.969
- Kind of pathetic.
- What is?

but half the people in this club

- are wearing my designs.
- Well, I don't mean to brag either,

10:55.254 --> 10:58.451
but everybody in this club is drinking
one of my drinks.

10:58.524 --> 11:00.788
Hey, Owen. Another round.

11:01.527 --> 11:03.586
Looks like I'm famous, too.

- I bet you we have sex right on this bar.
- Oh, okay. Peach Fuzzy, please.

11:09.835 --> 11:12.235
Look, I hate to be the one to break this
to you, but your mom...

11:12.304 --> 11:15.705
- I know. Is a total bitch, I get it.
- No. Well, I mean, yes,

11:15.775 --> 11:18.141

- Oh.

Will you keep your voice down?
I don't want the guys in here to know

11:47.473 --> 11:49.236
- I'm a mother.
- Why, you want them to think

11:49.308 --> 11:50.866
you're a prostitute?

11:50.943 --> 11:53.776
I noticed you rescheduled
the Macy's meeting without talking to me.

11:53.846 --> 11:57.304
I did. Because you work for me,
not the other way around.

11:57.383 --> 11:59.715
Ah, yes, and you've made that crystal clear.

you can do everything,

- You're embarrassing.
- Well, you won't listen to reason

so maybe embarrassing you
out of town is the answer.

12:08.961 --> 12:11.759

Not gonna affect me.

Hey, there you are. What do you need?

12:27.613 --> 12:30.707

you and Lindsey.

No. I'm not okay.

13:01.013 --> 13:03.982
What if I'm so bad,
I destroy Peyton's label?

13:05.117 --> 13:08.052
You realize you just made
every shot, right?

13:08.420 --> 13:09.614
HALEY: That's amazing.

13:09.688 --> 13:11.918
I always play well
when I'm not thinking about it.

13:11.991 --> 13:13.788
Okay, great.
So when you get up on stage,

13:13.859 --> 13:16.487
- don't think. Just play.
- What if I fail?

13:16.562 --> 13:18.792
Well, people fail sometimes.
Look at Peyton.

13:18.864 --> 13:19.922
Hey.

13:20.833 --> 13:23.495
Mia, you're not gonna fail. I promise.

13:28.107 --> 13:31.702
Okay. So it's just like rock-paper-scissors,
only it's called ninja-bear-hunter.

13:31.777 --> 13:33.870
- And why do you play this again?
- I don't get out much.

13:33.946 --> 13:36.176
- Okay.
- Okay. On the count of three.

13:36.248 --> 13:37.977
One, two, three.

13:38.350 --> 13:39.578
Rowr...

13:39.985 --> 13:42.510
All right, hunter gets bear. Okay.

13:46.125 --> 13:49.185
- Um. Could you excuse me for a second?
- Sure.

13:49.261 --> 13:51.024
I'll be right back.

13:53.933 --> 13:56.026
Well, now that looked kinky.

13:56.101 --> 13:58.695
- Want to try it naked?
- What are you doing here?

13:58.771 --> 14:01.797
Looking for you.
Come on, let's get out of here.

14:05.711 --> 14:10.739
Listen, Alice, I think...
I think maybe we went a little fast.

14:11.150 --> 14:16.213
- I like you, and I like my job, I just...
- Marvin. It's fine.

14:16.355 --> 14:18.687
Go have fun. Enjoy your evening.

14:21.460 --> 14:23.360
- Thanks, Alice.
- Mmm.

14:38.611 --> 14:41.011
I'm sorry I haven't been around.
Mia's performing tonight

14:41.080 --> 14:43.913
and she's really nervous.
How've you been?

14:43.983 --> 14:46.247
I never realized how boring
bars can be without alcohol.

14:46.318 --> 14:50.345
- Yeah. Tell me about it.
- Tric needs to establish a "no-mom" rule.

14:50.422 --> 14:52.356
- I'm a mom.
- You don't count. You got married

14:52.424 --> 14:54.085
and pregnant before you graduated
high school.

14:54.159 --> 14:56.525
You'll be safely locked in a home
by the time you're 35.

14:56.595 --> 14:58.153
Good talking to you, Brooke.

14:58.230 --> 14:59.925
I got to get Mia backstage.
I'll see you in a bit.

14:59.999 --> 15:01.591
- All right.
- Bye.

15:04.136 --> 15:06.263
Good talking to both of you.

15:11.210 --> 15:13.371
- I'm not taking this.
- Luke, if any other tenant wanted

15:13.445 --> 15:14.742
the office, you would charge them rent.

15:14.813 --> 15:16.371
Yeah, but you're not just any other tenant.

15:16.448 --> 15:18.814
- I am now.
- Peyton, just...

15:18.884 --> 15:22.684
Look, if you keep talking to me,
you're gonna get in trouble.

15:32.431 --> 15:35.628
- Something on your mind?
- No, but my mom is on my last nerve.

15:35.701 --> 15:38.898
- You got anything for that?
- Yeah. Alcohol.

15:41.874 --> 15:45.207
- So, what did your mom do?
- I'll give you one guess.

15:51.417 --> 15:53.942
- That's your mom?
- No.

15:55.454 --> 15:57.115
Oh, my God, it is.

15:57.289 --> 15:59.587
I feel like I'm looking into the future here.

15:59.658 --> 16:02.456
- It's a rough road ahead, by the way.
- Okay, we're not talking anymore.

16:02.528 --> 16:03.620
Owen.

16:05.664 --> 16:08.064
Well, looks like your future self's calling.

16:08.133 --> 16:09.566
What do you like to drink in twenty years?

16:09.635 --> 16:10.863
Poison.

16:22.514 --> 16:25.915
I wonder if Haley knows what kind of girl
she hired to watch her son.

16:25.985 --> 16:28.215
What kind of girl is that, exactly?

16:28.287 --> 16:31.017
The kind of girl that drinks like a fish.

16:31.090 --> 16:34.184
And goes skinny-dipping late at night
when everyone else is asleep.

16:34.259 --> 16:35.749
Oh, my God.

16:35.828 --> 16:38.353
I didn't know anyone was around.

16:38.931 --> 16:40.455
I am so embarrassed.

16:40.532 --> 16:44.662
Haley asked me not to wear a bikini
and then I do something even dumber.

16:44.737 --> 16:47.604
I'm so sorry, I completely understand
if you wanna fire me.

16:47.673 --> 16:48.799
No. No, look.

16:48.874 --> 16:51.138
No one's gonna fire you, okay?
You do a great job.

16:51.210 --> 16:53.007
And Jamie loves you.

16:53.078 --> 16:56.104
I'm just telling you, you need to be
careful because if Haley caught you,

16:56.181 --> 16:59.082
this would be
a very different conversation.

16:59.685 --> 17:02.916
- You didn't tell her?
- No. You made a mistake, right?

17:02.988 --> 17:07.253
It's not the end of the world.
Haley doesn't need to know everything.

17:14.098 --> 17:15.691
No, she doesn't.

17:26.377 --> 17:28.676
Hey. I've been looking for you everywhere.

17:28.747 --> 17:31.910
Well, if you keep looking next to Peyton,
you're never gonna find me.

17:31.984 --> 17:35.886
But I guess sneaking around with her
at Tric is your new thing.

17:36.021 --> 17:37.511
Okay, what's going on with you?

17:37.589 --> 17:39.523
Why'd you sneak over here
the other night?

17:39.591 --> 17:43.789
- I saw your car parked outside.
- So that's why you've been so upset.

17:44.363 --> 17:47.093
- Why didn't you tell me sooner?
- No, Luke.

17:47.166 --> 17:49.862
- You should've told me.
- I didn't sneak here.

17:49.935 --> 17:52.096
I wasn't even planning on coming here,
I saw the light on

17:52.171 --> 17:56.369
and I tried to convince my friend
to be nicer to the girl that I love.

17:56.442 --> 17:57.636
Right.

17:57.943 --> 18:01.208
See, I'm still trying to figure out
which is which.

18:02.648 --> 18:04.843
Lindsey. Linds.

18:15.060 --> 18:16.857
I need a new office.

18:17.362 --> 18:20.024
Yeah, the one you have right now is
far too big and free.

18:20.099 --> 18:22.226
Well, I would settle for small
and expensive just as long as

18:22.301 --> 18:26.135
- it's not Lindsey-adjacent.
- Tell me I don't look like her when I dance.

18:26.205 --> 18:29.265
Tell me I don't look like her when I dance.

18:30.075 --> 18:32.339
Okay. If you tell me Lindsey's a bitch.

18:32.411 --> 18:35.209
Oh. My mom's a bitch. Lindsey's a bitch.

18:35.414 --> 18:37.780
Is there a woman here tonight
you haven't called a bitch?

18:37.850 --> 18:39.841
Well, I can think of one.

18:41.620 --> 18:43.952
Lindsey is just threatened by you.

18:44.022 --> 18:46.752
Why? It's not like I'm even after Lucas.

18:46.825 --> 18:48.554
So you keep saying.

18:49.128 --> 18:51.255
What, you don't believe me?

18:51.897 --> 18:53.694
Okay. Fine. Whatever.

18:54.199 --> 18:58.363
But for the record, you look
exactly like her when you dance. Bitch!

19:03.108 --> 19:04.370
I do not.

19:09.114 --> 19:11.810
Hey, so, what were we talking about
before you left?

19:11.884 --> 19:13.943
- How cute you are.
- Really?

19:14.019 --> 19:15.816
I think I would've remembered that.

(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)

- Yeah.

19:43.382 --> 19:45.748
- I'm sorry.
- No.

19:48.587 --> 19:49.884
(EXHALES)

19:50.022 --> 19:52.616
Hate it when hot girls hit on me, too.

20:04.970 --> 20:07.700
- What's the first line in my song?
- Didn't you write it?

20:07.773 --> 20:11.140
- So not the point right now.
- Okay, relax. You're gonna be great, Mia.

20:11.210 --> 20:14.737
And, honestly, what is the worst thing
that could happen?

20:19.218 --> 20:20.879
He just walked in.

20:35.500 --> 20:37.365
Can I buy you a drink?

20:38.136 --> 20:42.197
- Actually, my date took care of that.
- Well, we're halfway there then.

20:42.274 --> 20:44.834
I hope you're not trying to sit on my lap.

20:44.910 --> 20:47.743
I'm just looking for someone
to dance with.

20:48.347 --> 20:49.712
No, thanks.

20:51.149 --> 20:53.208
You know where to find me.

20:56.455 --> 21:00.619
- I've never seen your jealous side before.
- Well, you still haven't.

21:02.361 --> 21:03.453
Okay.

21:08.267 --> 21:09.598
What up, Nate?

21:09.668 --> 21:13.695
Yo, thanks for having my back earlier
in front of old man Scott.

21:13.939 --> 21:17.966
Quentin, how stupid are you for trying
to drink in the same club as your coach?

21:18.043 --> 21:19.067
Look who's talking.

21:19.144 --> 21:21.669
You flirting with that hot nanny of yours
in the same club as your wife.

21:21.747 --> 21:24.511
- I'm not flirting with anyone.
- Yo, big yo. Okay, yo.

21:24.583 --> 21:27.609
You had my back, so I got yours,
but I know flirting when I see it.

21:27.686 --> 21:30.519
And it look like she does, too, bro.

21:31.223 --> 21:32.485
(LAUGHS)

21:49.841 --> 21:52.366
Okay, she's almost on, how's she doing?

21:52.444 --> 21:55.174
I think she'll be okay as long as
the only lyrics to her songs are

21:55.247 --> 21:57.010
"Why is Jason here? Why is Jason here?"

21:57.082 --> 21:58.743
Why is Jason here?

21:59.751 --> 22:01.616

of the chance to stand up to the person

22:09.995 --> 22:12.429
that's kept them down. This is yours.

22:12.497 --> 22:15.762
Someone just tell me the first line
to my song, please.

and flirting with a hot bartender,
then yes, I can.

24:37.542 --> 24:40.272
