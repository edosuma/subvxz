00:02.003 --> 00:03.959
[narrator] Previously on Lost:

00:04.046 --> 00:05.126
[wet thud]

00:06.883 --> 00:10.626
- You killed Naomi!
- She wants her people to come here.

00:10.720 --> 00:13.507
And trust me, when they do,
we had better be far away from here.

00:13.598 --> 00:16.055
If you want to live,
you need to come with me.

00:27.278 --> 00:29.018
- [Jack] Who are you?
- Daniel Faraday.

00:29.113 --> 00:30.523
I'm here to rescue you.

00:30.615 --> 00:33.778
[Naomi] This is the team? These are
the wrong people for this mission.

00:33.868 --> 00:36.701
None of them have field experience,
military training.

00:36.787 --> 00:39.779
You can't drop them in unprotected.
There's only so much I can do.

00:39.874 --> 00:42.490
Where's the chopper?
Where did it crash?

00:42.585 --> 00:46.203
What kind of pilot do you think I am?
I put her down safe and sound.

00:46.297 --> 00:48.879
- Get up. You're coming with us.
- We need to stay where we are

00:48.966 --> 00:51.708
- so they can find us.
- See, there's your problem.

00:51.802 --> 00:53.383
We don't want to be found.

00:53.471 --> 00:56.213
You want to know why we're here?
I'll tell you why.

00:56.307 --> 00:58.798
We're here for Benjamin Linus.

00:58.893 --> 01:01.054
Now where is he?

01:21.415 --> 01:24.407
[Jack] Did Ben mention knowing
anyone off the island?

01:24.502 --> 01:26.743
- You're sure of that?
- This is real simple.

01:26.837 --> 01:28.919
Do you know where he is, or don't you?

01:29.006 --> 01:31.998
- What do you want with him?
- I want to locate him.

01:32.093 --> 01:35.005
The people who hired me told me
his name's Benjamin Linus.

01:35.096 --> 01:37.553
They gave me this picture,
that's all he told me.

01:37.640 --> 01:40.256
They said find him.
And for what they're paying me,

01:40.351 --> 01:42.182
I don't need to know anything else.

01:43.062 --> 01:44.393
Do you?

01:46.023 --> 01:50.107
[Jack] You want Ben? OK,
he's with Locke and your friend...

01:50.194 --> 01:51.900
- [Miles] Charlotte.
- Charlotte.

01:51.988 --> 01:54.695
[Jack] Locke's got her too.
We know where he's heading.

01:54.782 --> 01:58.616
[Miles] Locke's the guy that killed
Naomi. Give me back my gun, Shephard.

01:58.703 --> 02:01.160
[Jack] You want your gun back,
I want answers.

02:01.247 --> 02:03.909
[Miles] You don't trust me,
I don't trust you.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.619
In fact, you're supposed to be dead.
Am I asking a billion questions? No.

02:08.713 --> 02:11.705
We both have the same problem,
this Locke guy.

02:11.799 --> 02:15.257
Even if Locke has your friend,
you can't waltz in there and grab her.

02:15.344 --> 02:17.801
- They're armed.
- How about that? So are we.

02:17.888 --> 02:20.721
- Why don't we move out...?
- You're not going anywhere.

02:20.808 --> 02:24.300
- Will that helicopter fly?
- It's what she does.

02:24.395 --> 02:27.387
- Then you can take me to your ship.
- Sayid, wait a second.

02:27.481 --> 02:30.689
We did call these people
to get us off this island, didn't we?

02:33.154 --> 02:34.940
Well?

02:35.031 --> 02:37.989
I burned a lot of fuel coming in.
I can't carry much weight.

02:38.075 --> 02:40.487
- I'll take three of you.
- In case you zoned out

02:40.578 --> 02:44.162
while tweezing your goatee, one
of these yahoos took Charlotte prisoner.

02:44.248 --> 02:46.330
I can bring her back safely.

02:50.421 --> 02:54.289
And if I do...
will you take me to the ship?

02:55.760 --> 02:57.000
Absolutely.

02:59.513 --> 03:01.720
You bring Charlotte back safe...

03:03.100 --> 03:05.386
...and I will take you off this island.

03:20.910 --> 03:23.401
[golf cart approaching]

03:27.875 --> 03:29.866
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

03:29.960 --> 03:33.452
It's a long walk to the next hole.
Do you need a ride?

03:33.547 --> 03:36.209
Thank you, but no.
My ball is right here.

03:36.300 --> 03:39.087
u i v
Yo 'rethefrst erson l' eseen
out here all morning.

03:40.429 --> 03:43.671
I believe we're paying quite a premium
for that kind of privacy.

03:43.766 --> 03:45.973
Indeed, we are.

03:49.105 --> 03:51.312
Is this your first time
in the Seychelles?

03:54.276 --> 03:56.437
Uh-uh. I'd use the five iron.

03:57.488 --> 03:59.228
I think I'll stick with the seven.

03:59.323 --> 04:04.067
Tell you what. Fifty euros says mine
goes closer to the pin with a five.

04:07.581 --> 04:08.696
Let's make it 100.

04:08.791 --> 04:10.656
[speaks foreign language]

04:11.669 --> 04:14.285
Amazing, huh? How we wager.

04:14.380 --> 04:16.291
Makes just about anything more fun.

04:31.939 --> 04:33.270
Not bad.

04:33.357 --> 04:34.597
Not bad.

04:36.068 --> 04:39.606
So, what do you do for a living,
my friend?

04:40.531 --> 04:43.193
- I do nothing.
- Nothing?

04:43.284 --> 04:45.070
Doesn't pay for a vacation here.

04:45.953 --> 04:48.114
l was the recipient
of a large settlement.

04:48.205 --> 04:50.867
- Corporate merger?
- Actually a plane crash.

04:53.169 --> 04:55.626
Oceanic Airlines flight 815.

04:55.713 --> 04:57.704
l'm Sayid Jarrah...

04:58.382 --> 05:00.373
...one of the Oceanic Six.

05:03.679 --> 05:05.419
Ah, that's...

05:05.514 --> 05:07.505
That's amazing.

05:08.642 --> 05:10.894
I remember reading all about it.

05:11.729 --> 05:13.390
Take your shot, my friend.

05:26.577 --> 05:29.535
It appears you were right
about the five iron.

05:30.247 --> 05:32.499
Well, uh...

05:33.501 --> 05:36.243
Enjoy your round.
Don't worry about the wager.

05:37.338 --> 05:40.171
- It's all in good fun.
- No, you won. Allow me to pay you.

05:40.257 --> 05:43.044
- It's fine, thank you.
- I insist, Mr. Avellino.

05:46.931 --> 05:47.920
[Avellino grunts]

06:16.293 --> 06:18.830
[people chattering]

06:39.400 --> 06:41.106
[speaks German]

06:50.953 --> 06:52.818
[speaks German]

06:53.372 --> 06:55.738
"Is it free?" was the full extent
of my German.

06:58.627 --> 07:00.913
What are you looking for?

07:01.005 --> 07:03.997
I love Europe.
Everyone speaks English.

07:04.091 --> 07:07.424
- I'm looking for Potsdamer Platz.
- You don't need a map.

07:07.511 --> 07:09.923
It's one block down,
right across the street.

07:10.014 --> 07:11.970
Thank you.

07:16.312 --> 07:18.769
l'm Elsa.

07:18.856 --> 07:20.596
Sayid.

07:21.317 --> 07:22.648
[man speaking German]

07:22.735 --> 07:24.600
Could I have an espresso, please?

07:24.695 --> 07:26.105
[man speaks German]

07:26.196 --> 07:28.653
What sort of business
brings you to Berlin?

07:28.741 --> 07:30.356
I'm a headhunter.

07:30.451 --> 07:31.941
A corporate recruiter.

07:33.287 --> 07:36.654
- And what do you do?
- My employer is an economist.

07:36.749 --> 07:39.206
He works in emerging markets.

07:39.293 --> 07:41.955
Actually, I don't really understand
what he does,

07:42.046 --> 07:45.379
which doesn't matter
since all I do is shop for him.

07:46.717 --> 07:48.423
And if this goes off,

07:48.510 --> 07:51.422
I'm at his side instantly.

07:51.513 --> 07:54.971
Which is wonderful, since he's only
in Berlin once or twice a year.

07:55.059 --> 07:58.722
Which is why you're enjoying
a luxuriously long midday coffee.

08:00.314 --> 08:01.645
Yes.

08:03.901 --> 08:05.562
[speaks German]

08:17.498 --> 08:19.113
Do I...

08:20.918 --> 08:22.499
...know you from somewhere?

08:23.545 --> 08:25.957
I'll tell you exactly where
you know me from...

08:27.716 --> 08:29.456
...if you let me take you to dinner.

08:37.101 --> 08:38.762
Umm...

08:43.232 --> 08:46.440
This is the restaurant
you're taking me tonight. 8:00.

08:47.945 --> 08:50.357
Well, if you can find it.

09:05.003 --> 09:08.040
[dialing]

09:08.132 --> 09:10.043
- [man] Hello?
- I made contact.

09:10.134 --> 09:11.465
[man] Good.

09:29.611 --> 09:30.942
Take a look at this.

09:32.489 --> 09:34.320
Naomi had it with her.

09:35.993 --> 09:37.949
She was looking for Desmond.

09:40.497 --> 09:43.989
Whatever their real agenda is
it's clear they're not sharing it.

09:44.084 --> 09:46.245
Maybe Desmond
can shed some light on this.

09:48.172 --> 09:50.914
[Jack] How long would it take
to get to the beach and back?

09:51.008 --> 09:52.248
[Juliet] Couple of hours.

09:53.677 --> 09:55.338
You mind?

09:55.429 --> 09:57.420
Anything I can do to help.

09:58.682 --> 09:59.762
[Jack] Sayid.

10:02.561 --> 10:04.222
So how are we gonna do this?

10:04.313 --> 10:07.555
You know the best candidate
for this kind of mission.

10:07.649 --> 10:11.267
- And what kind of mission is that?
- I'll make Locke release Charlotte,

10:11.361 --> 10:14.103
and I'm going to do it
without any bloodshed.

10:14.198 --> 10:16.655
As opposed to the way I'd do it?

10:17.367 --> 10:20.279
The last time you encountered him
you put a gun to his head

10:20.370 --> 10:21.701
and pulled the trigger.

10:21.789 --> 10:23.780
That's not good diplomacy.

10:24.541 --> 10:26.281
Hey, Jarrah.

10:27.002 --> 10:29.618
You think you're going
after Charlotte without me?

10:29.713 --> 10:31.078
Of course not.

10:31.173 --> 10:33.755
Oh. Well, good.

10:35.719 --> 10:37.050
Is there anything else?

10:39.139 --> 10:42.472
- Yeah. Give me my gun back.
- We leave in ten minutes.

10:47.564 --> 10:49.725
[panting]

10:49.817 --> 10:52.058
Ready to give us a name, Gizmo?

10:53.362 --> 10:56.445
He's not gonna tell you who
his spy is on their boat, James.

10:56.532 --> 10:57.942
[Sawyer] Yeah, and why not?

10:58.033 --> 11:00.445
[Locke] That's the only thing
keeping him alive.

11:00.536 --> 11:01.616
Here's an idea.

11:01.703 --> 11:04.319
Why don't we take a gun,
point it to his big toe

11:04.414 --> 11:06.541
and send that little piggy to market?

11:06.625 --> 11:10.834
And if he still doesn't want to tell us,
we'll move on to the roast beef.

11:10.921 --> 11:14.129
- Why don't we do that?
- Then we'd have to carry him.

11:33.902 --> 11:36.564
- [Aaron crying]
- [Claire] John, how much further is it?

11:36.655 --> 11:39.647
- I need to feed Aaron.
- It should be here, the cabin.

11:41.201 --> 11:43.783
Maybe we got turned around.
Could be anywhere.

11:43.871 --> 11:44.860
No, it was here.

11:44.955 --> 11:47.537
What's in this cabin
that's so important?

11:47.624 --> 11:50.661
John's looking for somebody
to tell him what to do next.

12:00.888 --> 12:02.879
I guess I was mistaken.
It doesn't...

12:02.973 --> 12:05.635
It doesn't matter.
Plan's the same. We keep moving.

12:05.726 --> 12:07.387
The barracks aren't far.

12:07.477 --> 12:11.561
If her team is with Jack's group,
they know we're going to the barracks.

12:11.648 --> 12:13.559
Yeah, and Red here was wearing a vest,

12:13.650 --> 12:16.733
which means her posse's gonna come
expecting a gunfight.

12:16.820 --> 12:19.402
If all they want is her,
maybe we should let her go.

12:19.489 --> 12:23.573
I thought we were just gonna go hide.
Why do we need to take prisoners?

12:23.660 --> 12:25.400
Because she'll be valuable.

12:25.495 --> 12:28.737
- How is she gonna be valuable?
- He means as a hostage, love.

12:30.417 --> 12:33.329
- No, this is not what I signed up for.
- What did you sign up for?

12:33.420 --> 12:37.333
If we let her go, they'll look at it
as a sign of good faith.

12:37.424 --> 12:39.585
They'll look at it
as an act of foolishness.

12:39.676 --> 12:41.587
I'm trying to come up with a compromise.

12:41.678 --> 12:43.669
We're beyond compromise.

12:43.764 --> 12:46.631
And right now, Hugo,
I'm making the decisions.

12:48.101 --> 12:50.717
Is that going to be a problem for you?

12:57.903 --> 12:59.643
[Kate] Kinda sucks, huh?

13:01.239 --> 13:02.445
What's that?

13:03.992 --> 13:05.983
Being told not to come along.

13:08.580 --> 13:10.571
Now you know what it feels like
to be me.

13:11.875 --> 13:14.457
Does that mean I should
wait 20 minutes and go anyway?

13:14.544 --> 13:17.911
- [both laughing]
- Touche.

13:25.806 --> 13:27.797
You should go with them, Kate.

13:29.893 --> 13:31.679
- You're serious?
- Yeah.

13:35.232 --> 13:37.223
What, don't you trust Sayid?

13:38.068 --> 13:39.478
I don't trust Locke.

13:41.738 --> 13:45.026
What's preventing him from doing to me
what he did to Naomi?

14:02.759 --> 14:04.044
You got room for one more?

14:05.387 --> 14:06.877
Oh, yeah, she gets a gun.

14:08.390 --> 14:11.882
- The gun's a last resort, Kate.
- You give Locke that same speech?

14:11.977 --> 14:14.389
Hey! Let's move out.

14:23.321 --> 14:25.778
This guy, Sayid, where is he from?

14:27.743 --> 14:29.233
lraq.

14:29.327 --> 14:30.988
Iraq?

14:32.414 --> 14:35.247
So he's just gonna go
and work everything out?

14:35.333 --> 14:37.324
What was he, a diplomat?

14:39.212 --> 14:40.918
No.

14:42.466 --> 14:44.081
No, he was a torturer.

14:56.104 --> 14:58.811
Naomi, were you close to her?

14:58.899 --> 15:01.060
Nope. Met her on the boat.

15:01.151 --> 15:03.893
You don't seem particularly affected
by her death.

15:03.987 --> 15:06.694
Sure, I'm affected. She was hot,
and I dug her accent.

15:06.782 --> 15:07.817
Nice.

15:08.575 --> 15:12.033
And this woman, Charlotte.
You don't care about her, do you?

15:12.120 --> 15:15.578
- Define "care."
- So much for camaraderie.

15:15.665 --> 15:18.998
Who's the one going after one
of their crash buddies with guns?

15:19.086 --> 15:21.418
Actually, I do care about Locke.

15:21.505 --> 15:25.999
Maybe you can tell me how he managed to
split your happy little family in half.

15:29.304 --> 15:33.047
There was a fundamental debate whether
your people came to rescue us...

15:33.141 --> 15:34.301
...or kill us.

15:35.769 --> 15:37.509
Which side did you land on?

15:39.314 --> 15:41.521
I'll let you know when I decide.

15:42.943 --> 15:46.026
[jazz music playing]

15:48.448 --> 15:50.439
You look fantastic.

15:53.120 --> 15:55.577
This is why I wanted to take you
to the opera.

16:01.044 --> 16:04.252
If a man can't wear his tuxedo
by the fifth date, why bother?

16:22.941 --> 16:24.272
You know what?

16:26.820 --> 16:28.560
I'm not bringing it.

16:29.239 --> 16:32.276
If tonight's the night he calls,
so be it.

16:37.455 --> 16:38.740
I'll carry it.

16:39.624 --> 16:42.707
If he does call,
I don't want you fired over me.

16:43.920 --> 16:46.832
You should tell your employer
there is newer technology.

16:47.591 --> 16:50.003
Oh, I've tried.
He's very old-fashioned.

16:50.093 --> 16:52.505
You know how bosses can be.

16:53.930 --> 16:55.591
Do you have a boss?

16:56.391 --> 16:58.427
Everyone has a boss, Elsa.

17:01.438 --> 17:03.429
Come on, we don't want to be late.

17:05.984 --> 17:07.849
Why are you still here?

17:07.944 --> 17:12.108
I mean, when we met, you said
you would be in Berlin for one week.

17:14.117 --> 17:17.325
The job I'm on is proving harder
to accomplish than I thought.

17:18.788 --> 17:20.870
Oh...

17:22.626 --> 17:23.741
...right.

17:24.878 --> 17:28.621
I was hoping it was because of me.

17:31.801 --> 17:32.836
Uaughs]

17:39.643 --> 17:41.008
Let's go.

17:41.102 --> 17:42.433
Strauss awaits.

18:20.725 --> 18:24.764
- What's his story?
- Daniel? Couldn't tell you.

18:24.854 --> 18:26.981
Half the stuff he says
goes way over my head.

18:27.065 --> 18:28.851
The other half goes way, way over.

18:29.776 --> 18:32.188
Uh, Frank, can I...?

18:32.279 --> 18:35.612
Sorry to interrupt. May I please
use the phone just for a sec?

18:35.699 --> 18:37.985
- For what?
- I want to call Regina on the boat.

18:38.076 --> 18:40.943
Since we're waiting
maybe I can just try to...

18:41.037 --> 18:43.653
- What is it, Daniel?
- I'd like to do an experiment.

18:43.748 --> 18:44.999
- Just...
- OK.

18:45.083 --> 18:47.790
You just keep it to that
science stuff, all right?

18:47.877 --> 18:50.539
If Minkowski gets on there,
hang up right away.

18:50.630 --> 18:52.416
Yeah, thank you, thank you.

18:52.799 --> 18:53.788
[phone ringing]

18:53.883 --> 18:55.419
- [woman] Hello?
- Regina?

18:55.510 --> 18:57.250
Hey, hi, it's Dan. Hang on.

18:58.054 --> 19:00.170
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah.

19:00.265 --> 19:02.051
Yeah? OK. Hang on.

19:02.142 --> 19:04.758
I'm... oh... Yes.

19:04.853 --> 19:08.516
I am all set here. I have a fix.
Are you locked in?

19:08.606 --> 19:12.315
- Getting your signal pretty clear.
- OK, great, then.

19:12.402 --> 19:14.108
OK.

19:14.988 --> 19:16.353
Fire the payload.

19:16.448 --> 19:17.938
[Regina] Payload away.

19:18.033 --> 19:21.525
Don't sweat it. He does this kind
of stuff on the boat all the time.

19:24.789 --> 19:27.280
[Regina] Forty kilometers to beacon.

19:27.375 --> 19:29.707
Thirty-ﬁve kilometers to beacon.

19:29.794 --> 19:31.785
Thirty kilometers to beacon.

19:31.880 --> 19:34.246
Twenty-ﬁve kilometers to beacon.

19:34.341 --> 19:36.707
Twenty kilometers to beacon.

19:36.801 --> 19:39.508
Fifteen kilometers to beacon.

19:39.596 --> 19:42.633
- Ten kilometers to beacon.
- Regina?

19:42.724 --> 19:44.840
Five kilometers to beacon.

19:44.934 --> 19:46.265
Zero.

19:46.353 --> 19:48.059
I don't have it.

19:48.146 --> 19:50.262
[Regina] That’s weird.

19:51.941 --> 19:54.603
That is far more than weird.

20:17.050 --> 20:20.087
What's with the swing set?
These people had daycare?

20:20.178 --> 20:23.136
- You think they're here yet?
- Let's find out.

20:40.490 --> 20:43.277
[pounding]

20:58.466 --> 21:01.208
- [pounding continues]
- It's coming from in there.

21:03.179 --> 21:04.214
[cocks gun]

21:10.520 --> 21:12.681
[muffled shouting]

21:24.868 --> 21:26.199
Hurley, what happened?

21:28.121 --> 21:29.236
They left me.

21:30.957 --> 21:34.996
Locke's gone off the reservation, man.
He took this one chick hostage.

21:35.086 --> 21:38.123
He said Walt was the one who
told him to kill the other chick.

21:38.214 --> 21:39.795
- Walt?
- Dude, don't ask.

21:39.883 --> 21:43.967
I was trying to argue with him
so he would chill, but...

21:44.053 --> 21:46.965
How about you stop babbling?
Tell us what happened to them.

21:47.056 --> 21:48.557
Where are they?

21:49.434 --> 21:51.971
- Who are you?
- Where the hell did they go, tubby?

21:52.061 --> 21:55.394
Oh, awesome, the ship sent us
another Sawyer.

21:55.482 --> 21:57.097
Hurley, where did they go?

21:57.192 --> 22:00.309
Guess they were too busy tying me up
to tell me. I don't know.

22:00.403 --> 22:03.361
- So they all left? All together?
- Yeah. They were freaked.

22:03.448 --> 22:07.157
Locke said the people on the ship were
coming to rescue Charlotte and kill us.

22:07.243 --> 22:09.985
So... are you?

22:13.208 --> 22:14.448
Not yet.

22:16.503 --> 22:20.166
Did they say anything that suggested
where they were going?

22:20.256 --> 22:23.498
Locke said they were going
by Ben's house before they took off.

22:23.593 --> 22:24.799
Why would he go there?

22:24.886 --> 22:27.844
For all I know they could've
locked Ben in the closet too.

22:27.931 --> 22:29.137
Where's Ben's house?

22:35.897 --> 22:38.684
- You mind if I ask you a question?
- Shoot.

22:39.901 --> 22:41.937
Did the Red Sox really win the Series?

22:42.028 --> 22:44.940
Hey, don't get me started
on that, all right?

22:45.823 --> 22:48.280
My dad's from the Bronx.
I bleed Yankee blue.

22:50.286 --> 22:53.153
I can't believe it's been 100 days
since I've seen a game.

22:57.961 --> 23:00.873
- [distant buzzing]
- It's the payload.

23:00.964 --> 23:02.920
It's finally here.

23:12.058 --> 23:14.891
- What is that?
- It's a rocket.

23:14.978 --> 23:17.185
[beeping]

23:19.857 --> 23:21.188
Oh, no.

23:26.406 --> 23:27.896
Thirty one minutes.

23:28.992 --> 23:30.482
Oh, no.

23:31.411 --> 23:32.617
This is not good.

23:35.540 --> 23:37.280
Your friends are back.

23:47.885 --> 23:49.421
[Desmond] Well...

23:51.681 --> 23:52.966
...look at that.

24:05.903 --> 24:08.815
Look for anything that might show
where they've gone.

24:08.906 --> 24:10.442
I'll start in here.

26:13.531 --> 26:15.522
Sayid!

26:19.495 --> 26:21.110
Don't worry, Kate's fine.

26:27.920 --> 26:29.330
Good job, Hugo.

26:30.590 --> 26:32.330
Sorry, dude.

26:36.179 --> 26:38.761
I'm sorry, Sayid. Nothing personal.

26:38.848 --> 26:42.136
- Where's Locke?
- Talking to that angry Chinese guy.

26:43.519 --> 26:45.430
I'm not going to hurt you, Hurley.

26:45.521 --> 26:47.728
Yeah. I saw you snap that guy's neck

26:47.815 --> 26:50.557
with that break-dancing thing
you do with your legs.

26:50.651 --> 26:52.061
I think I'll hang back here.

27:01.162 --> 27:03.118
Well...

27:03.206 --> 27:05.572
...I guess they're running out
ofjail space.

27:11.380 --> 27:14.122
- I lost a dollar, you know.
- How'd you manage that?

27:14.217 --> 27:16.583
I bet John that you wouldn't be
stupid enough

27:16.677 --> 27:18.884
to fall for your friend as bait.

27:21.349 --> 27:23.590
What do you know about friendship?

27:23.684 --> 27:27.268
I know it's no use having friends
you can't trust.

27:35.363 --> 27:37.274
So I'm your prisoner?

27:38.032 --> 27:40.068
If that sort of thing turns you on.

27:48.584 --> 27:50.575
What are you doing here with Locke?

27:52.588 --> 27:54.670
- I'm not with him.
- Yeah, you are, James.

27:54.757 --> 27:57.089
- What are you doing with Jack?
- I went with Jack

27:57.176 --> 27:59.462
because I believe he can
get us off this island.

28:03.766 --> 28:06.303
Then I guess that's the difference
between us.

28:09.438 --> 28:10.894
I ain't lookin' to leave.

28:12.066 --> 28:13.727
Why not?

28:17.113 --> 28:19.775
'Cause I ain't got nothing
back there for me.

28:20.950 --> 28:23.612
And what's here that's so much better?

28:25.079 --> 28:27.570
Why do you want to go back, Kate?

28:29.125 --> 28:32.538
Seem to recall you being shuttled off
to jail before we landed here.

28:35.423 --> 28:39.086
So if you think there's anything
waiting for you other than handcuffs,

28:39.176 --> 28:41.792
then you really don't know
how the world works.

28:44.307 --> 28:47.891
Look around us, Freckles.
We've got roofs over our heads.

28:47.977 --> 28:51.811
- Electricity, showers, beds.
- How long, Sawyer?

28:51.898 --> 28:54.685
How long do you think
we can play house?

29:00.364 --> 29:02.446
Why don't we find out?

29:21.385 --> 29:22.500
Iced tea.

29:29.352 --> 29:32.264
- Thought you might be thirsty.
- I'm thirsty.

29:35.483 --> 29:37.724
I'm sorry about all the theatrics,

29:37.818 --> 29:40.355
but I didn't know
how many of you there'd be

29:40.446 --> 29:42.186
or whether you'd be armed.

29:42.281 --> 29:44.943
I had to cover my bases.

29:45.034 --> 29:46.899
What have you done with Miles and Kate?

29:46.994 --> 29:50.361
Kate's with Sawyer,
and Miles is somewhere else.

29:52.875 --> 29:54.081
He's fine.

29:54.168 --> 29:57.581
- All I did was ask him some questions.
- Did he answer any?

29:57.672 --> 29:59.958
- No.
- Did you have more luck with the woman?

30:02.843 --> 30:04.674
Not particularly.

30:06.097 --> 30:07.883
Why don't you turn her over to me?

30:07.974 --> 30:10.465
- Why would I?
- I agree these people are liars,

30:10.559 --> 30:12.891
and they're certainly
not here to rescue us.

30:12.979 --> 30:16.642
But if I return safely with Charlotte,
they'll take me to the ship.

30:16.732 --> 30:20.145
It's our best chance of finding out
who they are and what they want.

30:20.236 --> 30:23.148
Well, then, I can save you
a lot of trouble, Sayid,

30:23.239 --> 30:26.072
because Ben says
he's got a spy on the boat.

30:27.660 --> 30:29.025
Who?

30:29.120 --> 30:30.701
It's a secret.

30:31.998 --> 30:35.661
Forgive me, but the day I start
trusting him is the day I sold my soul.

30:37.003 --> 30:40.086
Give me Charlotte,
allow me to do things my way,

30:40.172 --> 30:43.664
or a war is coming which we
will both be powerless to stop.

30:43.759 --> 30:46.011
Why would I give you Charlotte
for nothing?

30:46.095 --> 30:48.381
I think you misunderstood me.

30:48.472 --> 30:51.339
I never expected you
to give her to me for nothing.

30:56.772 --> 30:59.479
[soft rock music playing]

31:08.909 --> 31:11.742
- Should we get dressed?
- No.

31:14.165 --> 31:17.953
We're gonna have to get out
of this bed at a certain point.

31:19.128 --> 31:20.459
VVhy?

31:21.589 --> 31:24.046
Well, for one thing, because I know

31:24.133 --> 31:28.502
that eventually you're gonna have to go
to that job of yours, you know?

31:28.596 --> 31:31.508
The one you never talk about.

31:31.599 --> 31:34.181
There's nothing to talk about.
It's just a job.

31:37.813 --> 31:39.929
I know nothing about you.

31:42.526 --> 31:45.233
I understand you don't want
to talk about the crash,

31:45.321 --> 31:46.811
what happened to you.

31:47.656 --> 31:49.442
What about life now?

31:49.533 --> 31:51.194
What about you?

31:51.285 --> 31:54.493
It's what you do
when you're in love, right? You...

31:58.501 --> 31:59.832
Inlove?

32:04.006 --> 32:05.746
Yeah.

32:20.856 --> 32:22.016
OK.

32:24.527 --> 32:26.188
No more secrets.

32:30.699 --> 32:31.984
What do you want to know?

32:33.035 --> 32:35.777
[beeping]

32:39.125 --> 32:41.616
He's here. My boss.

32:41.710 --> 32:44.918
I... I have to go.

32:45.005 --> 32:45.994
Now?

32:48.551 --> 32:49.711
Where?

32:54.223 --> 32:55.884
The Hotel Adlon.

32:57.143 --> 32:58.132
My dress.

33:08.404 --> 33:09.894
Elsa.

33:12.408 --> 33:14.239
You have to leave Berlin.

33:14.910 --> 33:16.025
What?

33:17.246 --> 33:19.828
- You can't be here anymore.
- What do you mean?

33:19.915 --> 33:22.952
- Why would I...?
- People will be asking questions soon,

33:23.043 --> 33:25.295
about what happened to your employer.

33:27.590 --> 33:29.956
And you can't be around
to answer them.

33:34.305 --> 33:35.590
My employer?

33:40.060 --> 33:42.187
This is about my boss?

33:46.192 --> 33:48.353
- Who are you?
- It had nothing to do with...

33:48.444 --> 33:52.062
The cafe?
You meant to meet me there?

33:55.075 --> 33:58.203
You used me to get to my boss.
What did you say?

33:58.287 --> 34:00.198
People will ask
what happened to him?

34:00.289 --> 34:02.951
- It's best you don't know.
- You're gonna kill him?

34:07.213 --> 34:09.204
You're gonna kill him?

34:10.090 --> 34:12.081
Do you even know him?

34:13.010 --> 34:15.672
- His name is on a list.
- A list? What list?

34:15.763 --> 34:17.970
- You have a list.
- It's my employer's.

34:18.057 --> 34:20.218
- Who is that?
- It doesn't matter who he is!

34:20.309 --> 34:23.517
You kill people 'cause they're
on a list? Innocent people?

34:23.604 --> 34:26.311
The man you're working for
is not an economist.

34:39.912 --> 34:41.903
[dialing phone]

34:41.997 --> 34:45.285
[speaking German]

35:10.567 --> 35:12.228
What do you think you're...?

35:13.404 --> 35:16.066
[Elsa gasps]

36:05.914 --> 36:08.997
Hey, I'm gonna ask you one last time.

36:09.084 --> 36:11.075
Why was Naomi
carrying this picture of me?

36:11.170 --> 36:14.913
You gotta understand something,
she was senior management.

36:15.007 --> 36:16.213
She stayed on her own.

36:16.300 --> 36:18.632
Naomi told me you people
were hired by her.

36:19.928 --> 36:23.011
So you look me right in the eye
and tell me

36:23.098 --> 36:26.090
you've never seen or heard
of Penelope Widmore.

36:35.361 --> 36:37.727
Fine. You don't want to tell me
the truth?

36:37.821 --> 36:39.402
I'll find someone who will.

36:39.490 --> 36:41.947
See, when that takes off, I'm on it.

36:48.248 --> 36:49.749
He's back.

37:09.186 --> 37:12.303
- Where's Kate?
- She decided to stay.

37:19.488 --> 37:21.649
- What happened to Miles?
- I traded him.

37:21.740 --> 37:24.402
- Traded him?
- I promised you Charlotte. Here she is.

37:27.538 --> 37:29.403
- You cheated.
- Did I?

37:29.498 --> 37:30.908
Yes, you did.

37:30.999 --> 37:33.741
Lucky for you that guy's nothing
but a pain in my ass.

37:35.879 --> 37:36.994
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:37.089 --> 37:40.422
All right. That gives us room
for one more.

37:40.509 --> 37:41.919
Charlotte?

37:42.010 --> 37:45.218
Go back? With all the fun
I'm having here? No.

37:46.223 --> 37:47.554
I've got work to do.

37:48.767 --> 37:50.928
Seat's yours if you want it, Daniel.

37:51.019 --> 37:55.012
No, thank you. I think I should
probably stay with Charlotte.

37:56.483 --> 37:57.689
All right.

37:59.194 --> 38:00.400
Frank.

38:00.487 --> 38:01.602
Frank?

38:01.697 --> 38:03.779
Just... just one thing.

38:06.034 --> 38:09.947
Just be sure that you follow
the same exact bearing

38:10.038 --> 38:12.950
that we came in on, OK?
No matter what.

38:13.041 --> 38:16.875
By that I mean no matter what.
Just... stay on it.

38:18.422 --> 38:19.411
Roger that.

38:29.183 --> 38:30.138
Be careful.

38:30.225 --> 38:32.386
I don't have to talk you out of coming.

38:32.478 --> 38:35.686
As much as I like helicopter rides,
you got this one under control.

38:37.691 --> 38:40.182
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

38:42.237 --> 38:43.773
Send me a postcard.

38:47.034 --> 38:48.899
You said we have room for one more?

38:49.995 --> 38:51.326
Yeah. Why?

38:53.582 --> 38:55.243
We should bring Naomi home.

40:36.351 --> 40:37.682
[man] Take your shirt off.

41:00.542 --> 41:02.043
Is she dead?

41:04.046 --> 41:05.081
Yes.

41:07.215 --> 41:08.955
Why didn't she kill you?

41:12.387 --> 41:14.594
She was trying to get
information from me.

41:15.474 --> 41:17.180
[man] What sort of information?

41:22.939 --> 41:25.351
She wanted to know who I worked for.

41:27.027 --> 41:29.234
She wanted to know about you.

41:30.030 --> 41:31.440
[man] Of course she did.

41:35.744 --> 41:37.609
Why are you crying?
Because it hurts,

41:37.704 --> 41:40.286
or because you were
stupid enough to care for her?

41:43.377 --> 41:46.119
These people
don't deserve our sympathies.

41:46.922 --> 41:49.709
Need I remind you what they did
the last time you thought

41:49.800 --> 41:52.837
with your heart instead of your gun?

41:52.928 --> 41:55.635
You used that to recruit me
into killing for you.

41:55.722 --> 41:58.509
Do you want to protect
your friends or not, Sayid?

42:04.314 --> 42:06.305
I have another name for you.

42:10.946 --> 42:12.937
But they know I'm after them now.

42:20.247 --> 42:21.612
Good.
