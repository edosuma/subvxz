[Ryan] "Dear Carter,
I hope you never have to read this letter.

00:39.060 --> 00:42.140
In the last few years,
I've kept a secret from you.

00:42.820 --> 00:46.140
This tore me apart,
because we've never lied to each other.

00:47.260 --> 00:49.060
But you deserve to know the truth.

00:50.660 --> 00:51.860
For the past several years,

00:51.940 --> 00:55.980
I've been researching the connection
between magnetite and seismic activity.

00:56.660 --> 00:58.660
This space mission is a cover story.

00:59.420 --> 01:00.740
The public does not know

01:00.820 --> 01:03.980
I am actually on a classified assignment
to test out my theory."

01:04.060 --> 01:06.300
- [Hayley] Mom!
- [Carter] Ryan, dinner's ready.

01:06.380 --> 01:08.420
[Alex] Quick!
Hayley's gonna eat all the cake!

01:08.500 --> 01:10.300
- [Hayley chuckling]
- [chuckling]

01:11.140 --> 01:12.820
[Ryan] "If my theory works,

01:12.900 --> 01:15.980
we will have the ability
not only to detect earthquakes

01:16.060 --> 01:19.380
but to predict when they will strike,
saving countless lives.

01:21.380 --> 01:24.060
Unfortunately, this technology,
in the wrong hands,

01:24.140 --> 01:25.940
can also induce earthquakes.

01:26.780 --> 01:30.460
I know there are people out there
who will be happy to see our mission fail.

01:31.220 --> 01:34.180
I suspect Judy Hayward,
my mission's project manager,

01:34.260 --> 01:36.060
but I don't have
the evidence to prove it."

01:36.140 --> 01:37.140
[sighs]

01:38.260 --> 01:42.380
"If you are reading this,
it means that my concerns are correct

01:42.460 --> 01:44.780
and that something has happened to me.

01:47.820 --> 01:51.020
My dear Carter,
you are the love of my life."

01:51.100 --> 01:52.460
I think we should start with a toast.

01:52.540 --> 01:54.460
[Ryan] "It broke my heart
to hide the truth from you."

01:54.540 --> 01:55.700
- To Mom.
- To Mom.

01:55.780 --> 01:58.860
[Ryan] "But I did it to protect you
and Hayley and Alex.

02:00.060 --> 02:03.220
I love you always, Ryan."

02:34.420 --> 02:36.420
[theme music playing]

02:54.140 --> 02:58.460
Oh, cool. Guys, so let's put the DJ booth
over here in this corner. Yeah?

02:58.540 --> 02:59.540
Thank you.

03:00.220 --> 03:04.020
Leo, my man with the guitar.
Thank you so much for bringing that.

03:04.100 --> 03:05.580
You rock. You're gonna be great tonight.

03:05.660 --> 03:07.180
Hey, so I like this fish here,

03:07.260 --> 03:09.580
but I think it would be better
in the back and just...

03:10.380 --> 03:11.860
Oh, my God. Parker!

03:11.940 --> 03:14.460
That is so cool.
Where did you get this from?

03:14.540 --> 03:16.420
Yeah, well, my uncle
does props for commercials,

03:16.500 --> 03:18.020
so he let me borrow it for the dance.

03:18.100 --> 03:19.220
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

03:19.300 --> 03:20.980
- Oh, my God. Parker, thank you so much.
- Of course.

03:21.060 --> 03:24.020
- You are the best!
- Yeah, well, I'm glad you like it.

03:24.100 --> 03:26.140
- I love it. Thank you. I'll see you later?
- Okay.

03:26.220 --> 03:28.140
Good luck. Thanks.
Back to the fish...

03:28.220 --> 03:29.820
[Sophie continues speaking indistinctly]

03:31.420 --> 03:34.060
- Hayley, focus, all right?
- [sighs]

03:34.140 --> 03:36.260
I can't decide.
Which one do you like more?

03:36.340 --> 03:39.220
What, are you... You asking me?
I don't have a clue.

03:39.300 --> 03:41.860
- Your mom never wore dresses.
- Let me see the blue one again.

03:42.940 --> 03:44.900
Could you just put it up against yourself?

03:44.980 --> 03:48.140
What? Oh, come on.
Sweetie, I'm already late for work.

03:48.220 --> 03:51.180
I know, Dad. And I'm really excited
that you're back to your old job.

03:51.260 --> 03:52.500
But this is really important.

04:05.940 --> 04:07.300
[clears throat]

04:08.620 --> 04:09.740
[clears throat]

04:13.380 --> 04:14.620
Did you know that until the 1980s,

04:14.700 --> 04:16.540
this was the most censored book
in American schools?

04:16.620 --> 04:17.980
Teachers felt like it was a bad influence,

04:18.060 --> 04:21.100
which is probably why it was popular
in the first place.

04:24.300 --> 04:25.460
Listen... [clears throat]

04:25.980 --> 04:27.660
would you like to be my date?

04:28.740 --> 04:29.820
What?

04:29.900 --> 04:32.180
[stammers] Would you like to be my date
to the party tonight?

04:33.300 --> 04:35.260
I... I tried asking Emma,
but she's not going.

04:35.340 --> 04:37.660
So I figured, what the heck, I'd ask you.
What do you say?

04:37.740 --> 04:39.220
No, thanks.

04:39.300 --> 04:41.660
- Why not?
- I'm not going.

04:42.700 --> 04:45.660
But... why?

04:45.740 --> 04:48.500
- I'm trying to read.
- [sighs]

04:49.700 --> 04:51.020
Show me the other one.

04:51.100 --> 04:52.460
Which one is more '50s?

04:52.540 --> 04:54.100
You're from the last century,
you must know.

04:54.180 --> 04:56.900
[sighs] Yeah, uh,
I'm going to ignore that. Uh...

04:56.980 --> 04:58.940
[Max] Come on, Jackie,
it'll be so much fun.

04:59.020 --> 05:00.660
And you even get to wear a 1950s outfit.

05:00.740 --> 05:03.260
I'm not wearing anything. Leave me alone.

05:05.300 --> 05:08.380
- You know what, Dad? Send me them both.
- [Carter] Sure thing.

05:12.980 --> 05:13.980
What's your problem?

05:18.780 --> 05:20.020
[sighs]

05:23.060 --> 05:25.700
- Yo, D, could I talk to you for a second?
- What's up?

05:27.700 --> 05:31.100
[sighs] All right, I may need
to ask you for a small favour.

05:31.180 --> 05:32.580
- All right.
- All right.

05:33.460 --> 05:37.660
I thought it would be pretty cool
if I asked Sophie to be my date.

05:37.740 --> 05:39.900
- Sophie?
- Yeah.

05:39.980 --> 05:40.980
Really?

05:42.060 --> 05:42.900
Okay.

05:43.860 --> 05:45.060
Anyway, I...

05:45.140 --> 05:46.900
You know, I just figured
you could talk to Brooke

05:46.980 --> 05:48.980
and, like, see if she's
dating anyone right now.

05:49.060 --> 05:51.020
[scoffs] What are you,
in the second grade?

05:51.100 --> 05:54.700
You want me to go pass her a note
in math class? Come on. Jeez.

05:55.420 --> 05:57.740
Yeah, you're right. Forget it.

05:57.820 --> 05:59.620
[Brooke laughing]

06:04.100 --> 06:06.700
Where are you going? D...

06:06.780 --> 06:08.860
Hey, why don't I take
a picture of you two, huh?

06:08.940 --> 06:11.940
Oh, that's okay, Daniel.
We got some good selfie shots.

06:12.020 --> 06:13.180
Oh, I'm sure you did.

06:14.180 --> 06:16.340
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

06:18.100 --> 06:20.100
Here, why don't I, uh,
take a photo of you two?

06:20.180 --> 06:23.180
Uh, no, thanks, Alex. I wouldn't wanna be
a third wheel to your party.

06:24.020 --> 06:27.260
Hey, Alex, I need your help
with some of these party decorations.

06:36.100 --> 06:37.540
Why is Daniel mad at me?

06:38.580 --> 06:40.300
[scoffs] Daniel's mad at the world.

06:41.300 --> 06:45.220
But... I have an idea
that might calm him down.

06:45.300 --> 06:48.900
[news anchor] NASA reports there's
still no communication with the satellite

06:48.980 --> 06:50.660
after 48 hours.

06:50.740 --> 06:54.340
Growing opposition demands
reduced funding for future NASA space...

06:55.420 --> 06:56.420
[sighs]

07:09.420 --> 07:10.900
What's up, Sophie?

07:10.980 --> 07:12.380
- Oh, hey, Parker.
- Hey.

07:12.460 --> 07:14.660
- Uh, you got a minute?
- Yeah, sure.

07:14.740 --> 07:16.380
Great, great. Um...

07:16.460 --> 07:19.460
Listen, I was just kind of thinking
maybe you'd...

07:19.540 --> 07:22.820
you know, like to go with me
to the dance tonight.

07:22.900 --> 07:25.540
Oh, my God,
that's so sweet of you, Parker.

07:25.620 --> 07:28.820
But Alex just asked me to go
to the dance with him, and I said yes.

07:29.460 --> 07:31.220
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah, sorry.

07:31.300 --> 07:33.700
- Yeah, no. It's... it's totally cool.
- [chuckles]

07:33.780 --> 07:35.580
- Yeah, but you look super nice, though.
- [scoffs]

07:35.660 --> 07:39.420
Thank you. It's the... Well...
Yeah, I'll let you finish.

07:39.500 --> 07:41.260

Nothing.

08:07.420 --> 08:09.220
I can't tell you. It's kind of a surprise.

08:10.060 --> 08:11.860
I really hate surprises.

08:12.780 --> 08:14.460
You'll love this one. Trust me.

08:14.540 --> 08:17.820
Now, what kind of school is this?
Don't you kids have homework to do?

08:17.900 --> 08:19.220
Dad!

08:22.620 --> 08:24.660
- Hey.
- I thought you were late for work.

08:24.740 --> 08:27.620
I told Chief Diggs
I had a special delivery to make first.

08:27.700 --> 08:29.220
- [gasps] Thank you.
- Mmm-hmm.

08:30.740 --> 08:35.059
- Oh, gosh. I haven't been here in years.
- [Hayley] Mmm-hmm.

08:36.500 --> 08:42.020
Mmm. Your mom always used to be up
on that board when she was a student here.

08:42.100 --> 08:43.460
Hmm. No pressure.

08:48.500 --> 08:49.580
That's nice.

08:50.940 --> 08:52.020
Yeah, it is.

08:54.780 --> 08:56.740
Which reminds me, I also brought you this.

08:59.980 --> 09:02.020
Your mom would've wanted you
to wear this tonight.

09:09.100 --> 09:10.380
It's beautiful.

09:11.540 --> 09:12.540
Thank you.

09:14.340 --> 09:15.300
I just don't get it.

09:15.380 --> 09:17.860
One minute Daniel's fine,
and the next, watch out.

09:17.940 --> 09:19.660
Well, he's obviously
going through something.

09:19.740 --> 09:21.340
But that doesn't mean
he should take it out on you.

09:21.420 --> 09:23.100
I know. That's what I'm saying.

09:23.660 --> 09:24.980
You know, he's just mad at me

09:25.060 --> 09:27.700
because I suggested his mom
had something to do with the car accident.

09:28.460 --> 09:30.420
Well, maybe he's right, Brooke.

09:30.500 --> 09:32.660
I mean, you know
how protective he is of his mom.

09:32.740 --> 09:35.060
But, hey, don't ruin the dance
for yourself. Okay?

09:35.140 --> 09:37.540
You're just going through a rough patch.
You two are a great couple.

09:37.620 --> 09:40.300
[sighs] I know. Thanks, Soph.

09:42.780 --> 09:44.900
So, you and Alex?

09:46.060 --> 09:48.980
I told Alex he had to ask me out
to the dance to get Daniel off his back.

09:50.020 --> 09:51.100
But you know what?

09:52.500 --> 09:54.740
Alex really isn't afraid to be himself.

09:54.820 --> 09:56.980
- I think that's kind of cool.
- [chuckles]

09:57.060 --> 09:58.100
Plus, he's cute.

10:00.180 --> 10:04.300
Once in a gazillion years,
I ask you for one favour.

10:04.380 --> 10:06.780
And now I don't even have anyone
to go to the dance with.

10:06.860 --> 10:08.620
- So you're blamin' me?
- Yeah!

10:08.700 --> 10:12.300
Wow, Parker.
I really didn't think you were that naive.

10:12.380 --> 10:13.620
Naive?

10:13.700 --> 10:15.940
That guy is a snake.

10:16.020 --> 10:19.740
Alex pretends to be our friend, then he
hits on my girlfriend behind my back.

10:19.820 --> 10:22.300
And now this dude's trying
to come between me and you.

10:23.380 --> 10:25.300
- So you think...
- Look, just between us,

10:25.380 --> 10:28.380
he is the one who's been telling me to
convince you to stop running for captain.

10:29.020 --> 10:30.020
- What?
- Yeah.

10:31.940 --> 10:33.740
Hey, Dad. Wait there. I'm coming.

10:35.220 --> 10:36.460
[Sophie chuckles]

10:37.060 --> 10:41.020
- Sorry about what happened with Daniel.
- Don't apologize. You did nothing wrong.

[chuckles]

10:56.460 --> 10:58.820
[dance music playing]

11:10.820 --> 11:14.380
So I get why Daniel's mad at me,
but what did I ever do to Parker?

11:15.940 --> 11:17.820
Oh, my gosh. I was afraid of that.

11:17.900 --> 11:19.020
Of what?

11:20.060 --> 11:22.540
Remember when I asked you
to ask me out to the dance?

11:23.180 --> 11:26.140
Parker came and asked me out right after.

11:28.500 --> 11:29.580
Should we tell him what happened?

11:29.660 --> 11:31.780
No. No way.
That'll only make things worse.

11:31.860 --> 11:34.020
[grunts] I'm so screwed.

11:37.460 --> 11:38.660
[inaudible]

11:44.420 --> 11:46.900
Remember, it's always best
to do one button, and just the top one.

I know how a suit works, Max, thank you.

[indistinct chatter]

12:01.140 --> 12:03.820
- Wow.
- Look at you!

12:05.060 --> 12:07.940
I feel weird. I can't breathe.

12:10.740 --> 12:12.300
You look so different.

12:13.220 --> 12:15.500
In a good way, I guess.
I mean, I'm sure.

12:15.580 --> 12:19.020
- Do you remember the rules?
- I think so. No, I don't.

12:19.100 --> 12:20.980
A, no slow dancing.

12:21.060 --> 12:24.180
- B, do not call me your date.
- Okay. Great Scott!

And C, don't quote
Back to the Future to me again ever.

12:31.580 --> 12:33.420
You're dying to kiss me, aren't you?

12:34.780 --> 12:36.620
You like to get right to the point,
don't you, Woods?

12:37.700 --> 12:42.100
No. I just remembered that you
once said kissing me wasn't a good idea.

12:42.220 --> 12:44.140
I say a lot of stupid things.

12:45.060 --> 12:46.580
I'll keep that in mind.

12:54.260 --> 12:55.380
- Ready?
- Yeah.

12:55.460 --> 12:56.460
Okay.

12:59.020 --> 13:01.020
[dance music playing]

13:14.420 --> 13:16.900
Hello there. So, are you guys dating?

13:16.980 --> 13:19.460
Um, I'm sure we'll find out the answer
on your blog tomorrow.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.020
- Very funny.
- [Hayley chuckles]

13:25.020 --> 13:27.140
Did you see Dad? Doesn't he look great?

13:27.220 --> 13:28.980
Totally. I'm so happy he's back at work.

13:29.060 --> 13:30.340
- Me, too.
- Yeah.

13:32.980 --> 13:35.860
Things are starting to fall into place,
don't you think?

13:35.940 --> 13:39.980
Yeah, except that every guy
at my clubhouse hates me. So there's that.

13:42.140 --> 13:43.980
How'd you swing that? I thought he choked.

My mom's made me take dance classes
since I was five.

14:09.980 --> 14:11.540
She said they would come in handy

14:11.620 --> 14:13.740
if I became the president
and had to dance at a state dinner.

14:13.820 --> 14:16.540

[playing '50s rock and roll music]

17:01.860 --> 17:04.260
You know, there's good reason
this dance move is extinct.

17:04.339 --> 17:05.339
It's ridiculous.

17:14.380 --> 17:16.140
- Great Scott!
- [laughs]

17:16.220 --> 17:17.900
I didn't know you liked
Back to the Future.

17:17.980 --> 17:20.060
Like it?
I have the entire movie memorized.

17:20.140 --> 17:22.420
- I must have seen it, like, 64 times.
- [both chuckle]

17:24.859 --> 17:27.380
Wait. Is this a flux capacitor?

17:27.460 --> 17:28.580
It is. [chuckles]

17:52.700 --> 17:55.100
