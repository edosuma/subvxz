00:30.041 --> 00:33.000
I'm sick of it, sis.
I can't breathe here.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.041
<i>What is up with you?
Cheryl, calm down.</i>

00:35.041 --> 00:36.125
No!

00:36.666 --> 00:40.291
No, they... they look at you
like you're worthless!

00:40.291 --> 00:42.375
They make you stand there and wait,

00:42.375 --> 00:44.833
like you're some sort of reprobate
or something.

00:44.833 --> 00:47.041
Like you're shit
on the sole of their shoe!

00:47.041 --> 00:50.291
<i>Who makes you wait?
You're not making any sense.</i>

00:50.291 --> 00:51.791
<i>Is this... one of your dips?</i>

00:51.791 --> 00:53.583
The housing office!

00:53.583 --> 00:56.083
I was down there earlier
asking for help with the rent.

00:56.083 --> 00:57.583
<i>You've got a job!</i>

00:57.583 --> 01:01.041
<i>You and Michael need to stop
living fancy off those credit cards.</i>

01:01.583 --> 01:04.916
<i>I won Saleswoman of the Year
three times in a row!</i>

01:05.500 --> 01:08.083
-  I shouldn't be where I am now!

01:08.083 --> 01:10.583
<i>Carl! Go check on your sister.</i>

01:10.583 --> 01:11.541
I want more.

01:12.625 --> 01:14.000
Is it wrong to want more?

01:14.000 --> 01:16.541
<i>We</i> all <i>want more, Cheryl.</i>

01:17.250 --> 01:20.083
<i>But we're dealt
the cards we're dealt.</i>

01:20.625 --> 01:22.875
<i>You've... just... gotta...
make the most of things.</i>

01:23.791 --> 01:26.291
<i>Now, what time you popping round later?</i>

01:27.041 --> 01:29.666
<i>Yeah. Yeah, you're right.</i>

01:30.166 --> 01:31.333
<i>"The most of things."</i>

01:32.916 --> 01:34.083
<i>Just having a low day.</i>

01:35.333 --> 01:36.500
<i>Bit of a dip.</i>

01:37.583 --> 01:39.208
<i>I'll see you at five, yeah?</i>

03:11.666 --> 03:14.500
<i>Hello.
Your call cannot be taken at the moment,</i>

03:14.500 --> 03:17.125
<i>so please leave your message
after the tone.</i>

03:43.000 --> 03:45.833
<i>Hello.
Your call cannot be taken at the moment,</i>

03:45.833 --> 03:48.375
<i>so please leave your message
after the tone.</i>

03:49.375 --> 03:52.125
-  <i>Cheryl, where are you?</i>

03:53.291 --> 03:54.791
<i>Answer the goddamn phone.</i>

05:07.041 --> 05:09.208
Wonderful morning, isn't it?

05:12.166 --> 05:13.166
Oh.

05:16.791 --> 05:20.291
Wonderful morning.
Wonderful morning, isn't it?

05:20.291 --> 05:23.250
Wonderful morning, isn't it?

05:23.250 --> 05:24.625
Isn't it just?

05:24.625 --> 05:27.208
And you're looking just divine, as usual.

05:27.208 --> 05:28.375
Charmer.

05:28.958 --> 05:32.750
You coming to my charity gala this Friday?
We're opening up the doors.

05:32.750 --> 05:34.000
Ooh! Exciting!

05:34.000 --> 05:35.708
Disability. In the Gambia.

05:35.708 --> 05:38.541
-  Sounds splendid.
- Shall I put you down for 500?

05:39.125 --> 05:41.333
- Pounds?
-  Yes, unless...

05:41.333 --> 05:45.291
Oh... no, of course.
550 even. Happy to help.

05:45.291 --> 05:46.833
So kind.

05:58.125 --> 06:00.875
Well, can't we add more?
We want a full house.

06:00.875 --> 06:03.333
<i>I work in insurance, hon,
not hospitality.</i>

06:03.333 --> 06:05.041
This is important, Ian.

06:05.541 --> 06:07.458
These things carry weight
in the community.

06:07.458 --> 06:09.750
I've been working towards this
for so long.

06:10.666 --> 06:11.666
<i>Okay.</i>

06:12.166 --> 06:13.666
<i>Okay, I'll get it done.</i>

06:13.666 --> 06:15.708
And don't forget the langoustines.

06:25.625 --> 06:26.750
Hello, Neve!

06:27.250 --> 06:30.083
-  How's she getting on?
-  Oh, she's a treat.

06:30.083 --> 06:31.875
A right little worker bee.

06:31.875 --> 06:35.041
Isn't she just?
What's happened to your hair, darling?

06:35.833 --> 06:36.666
It's a style.

06:37.458 --> 06:38.291
Right.

06:38.291 --> 06:40.458
Trends are always changing, aren't they?

06:40.458 --> 06:41.791
They are indeed.

06:41.791 --> 06:44.458
Will you be wanting
anything for your event?

06:44.458 --> 06:47.708
Mary's been telling me all about it.
A signed choir?

06:47.708 --> 06:52.916
Oh, yes. <i>The Dream of Gerontius</i> by Elgar.
The journey of a dead man's soul.

06:53.500 --> 06:54.416
Sounds marvelous.

06:56.541 --> 07:00.083
I'll pick up some expensive shampoo later
and run you a nice bath.

07:00.083 --> 07:01.500
A little pamper party.

07:08.958 --> 07:12.208
When you came here, you didn't
even know what a village fête was.

07:12.208 --> 07:14.583
Now look at you.
Throwing your very own gala!

07:14.583 --> 07:17.916
- Well, you must've inspired me.
-  I'd like to think so.

07:17.916 --> 07:19.958
We're all so proud.

07:20.583 --> 07:22.666
You're a real example of fortitude, Neve.

07:22.666 --> 07:24.791
I understand the impulse
to want to give back.

07:24.791 --> 07:26.375
It's not just giving back.

07:26.375 --> 07:29.166
It's bringing it all together,
my time here.

07:29.166 --> 07:30.541
A graduation of sorts.

07:30.541 --> 07:32.708
And an opportunity
to show off the new kitchen.

07:32.708 --> 07:34.916
Well, that too, obviously.

07:52.041 --> 07:55.791
But, Neve, really, come on,
there's nothing to prove here.

07:56.291 --> 07:58.750
- You're practically one of us.
-"Practically"?

07:58.750 --> 07:59.958
You know what I mean.

07:59.958 --> 08:02.791
And you are drop-dead gorgeous.
You haven't aged a bit.

08:02.791 --> 08:04.958
It's actually <i>quite</i> infuriating.

08:06.375 --> 08:08.208
- I'm getting it.
-  I'm so sorry.

08:08.208 --> 08:10.875
Thank you very much.
Excuse me. Gotta go to the loo.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.791
Without the service. Thank you.

09:19.291 --> 09:21.416
Need help with anything
in there, sweetheart?

09:21.416 --> 09:22.541
I'm fine.

09:29.500 --> 09:31.625
You wouldn't believe
what happened to <i>me</i> today.

09:31.625 --> 09:33.583
- In the car.

09:33.583 --> 09:36.500
-  Anyone seen my poster?
- What poster? Ian.

09:36.500 --> 09:38.625
The Lil Wayne one? In the gym?

09:38.625 --> 09:41.333
- Your mum's telling a story.
- It's just disappeared, then?

09:41.333 --> 09:43.291
So, yes, I'd just had tea
with Amanda, and I...

09:44.208 --> 09:46.708
-  No phones at the table, Mary.
- Sorry.

09:47.291 --> 09:50.125
So I'm driving along, when I see
someone dodgy from out of town,

09:50.125 --> 09:51.916
and...

09:51.916 --> 09:53.083
...you wouldn't believe

09:53.083 --> 09:57.375
straight into the back of Sonia's car.
Near tore off her entire bumper.

09:57.958 --> 09:59.625
- Send her over.
-  You'll sort it?

09:59.625 --> 10:01.250
- Course.
- Thank you, darling.

10:02.625 --> 10:03.833
- Cute.
- Gross.

10:05.416 --> 10:07.333
We just hired a girl from out of town.

10:07.333 --> 10:08.833
Oh, really? What girl?

10:08.833 --> 10:10.458
A lovely young Black girl.

10:10.958 --> 10:12.875
Mm. Black?

10:14.916 --> 10:16.333
- Well, we're Black.
- Yeah.

10:17.291 --> 10:19.166
What was her name? This girl?

10:20.208 --> 10:22.916
Abigail. She's quite charming indeed.

10:23.791 --> 10:24.625
Hm.

10:32.625 --> 10:34.125
Your hidden skills.

10:34.958 --> 10:39.208
Told you before.
It was a side job for a bit when I was 15.

10:41.041 --> 10:41.916
Down in Catford?

10:42.791 --> 10:44.541
- Up in Fulham.
- Was it?

10:45.375 --> 10:46.791
"Was it?" indeed.

10:59.458 --> 11:01.333
Do you think Sebastian's okay?

11:01.833 --> 11:02.791
Why wouldn't he be?

11:02.791 --> 11:06.041
Are we giving him enough space to,
I dunno...

11:06.041 --> 11:08.208
- What?
- Express himself.

11:08.208 --> 11:10.583
Sebastian has everything he needs.

11:11.291 --> 11:15.125
Speaking of which, I just pre-ordered him
the new Xbox for his birthday.

11:15.125 --> 11:16.875
What's wrong with the one he has?

11:52.000 --> 11:54.708
-  Oh, Neve.

12:20.375 --> 12:22.208
You don't have to cover it up.

12:23.291 --> 12:24.583
I know I don't have to.

12:26.041 --> 12:28.416
I used to love
the way you had it before.

12:29.583 --> 12:31.958
Well, thanks for letting
your feelings be known.

12:34.375 --> 12:36.208
Come on, you know what I mean.

12:36.208 --> 12:38.000
It's just maintenance, that's all.

12:41.041 --> 12:42.458
Let's go to sleep, shall we?

12:45.041 --> 12:46.000
I'll be in in a mo.

14:28.416 --> 14:31.125
Sebas, have you been drawing
on the mirrors?

14:31.125 --> 14:33.708
- What? No, of course not.

14:55.666 --> 14:56.541
Be safe!

15:14.083 --> 15:15.541
Morning, Miss Williams.

15:19.666 --> 15:22.625
Castle Combe School has, yet again,

15:22.625 --> 15:26.291
outperformed other private schools
across the country.

15:26.291 --> 15:28.541
And, for the fifth year in a row,

15:28.541 --> 15:32.250
our deputy head
and theology course leader, Mrs. Williams,

15:32.250 --> 15:37.750
has outdone us all
with the most A-stars this senior year.

15:39.250 --> 15:41.875
Even if she still hasn't
given in her references.

15:41.875 --> 15:46.250
Well, I'd accept another medal,
but I'm currently out of wall space.

15:47.958 --> 15:49.458
Off to class now.

15:49.458 --> 15:51.291
No loitering in the corridor.

15:54.416 --> 15:55.250
Now!

15:56.500 --> 15:59.000
Come on, girls! This isn't a photo shoot.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.750
Off to class immediately.

16:01.750 --> 16:02.583
Quickly!

16:25.500 --> 16:27.583
Sebas. Sebastian!

16:35.291 --> 16:37.208
- What?
-  "What?"

16:37.750 --> 16:40.291
- Shouldn't you be in class?
- Yeah, I'm on my way.

16:40.291 --> 16:42.833
Well, then.
Instead of talking to strangers.

16:42.833 --> 16:45.333
-  "Strangers"?

16:51.333 --> 16:53.208
Have you got your phone on you?

16:53.208 --> 16:54.416
Maybe.

16:54.416 --> 16:56.833
Keep it on.
In case I need to get hold of you.

17:11.125 --> 17:12.000
Thank you.

17:13.625 --> 17:15.791
And now into sound.

17:19.833 --> 17:21.750
That's it. Very nice.

18:25.458 --> 18:26.625
Who gave you that?

18:29.541 --> 18:31.083
- Where is he?
- Who?

18:31.083 --> 18:33.875
"Who?" This is the game
you wanna play with me?

18:33.875 --> 18:34.833
<i>I</i> bought them.

18:34.833 --> 18:38.041
Don't treat me like a fool!
I can suspend you, young man.

18:38.541 --> 18:40.916
Don't forget,
I am your mother and the headmistress.

18:40.916 --> 18:43.041
- Deputy.
- Inside. Now.

18:44.541 --> 18:45.750
We'll finish this later.

19:00.250 --> 19:02.250
- Where's your brother?
- It's Tuesday.

19:02.750 --> 19:04.541
-  Yes?
- Basketball?

19:04.541 --> 19:07.625
Basketball, yes. Of course. Basketball.

19:24.750 --> 19:25.750
Mum! Look out!

19:45.958 --> 19:47.541
-  It's here.
-  What?

19:47.541 --> 19:49.375
-  Emily's house.
-  Oh.

19:51.625 --> 19:54.166
- Are you all right?
- Yes, yes, I'm fine. I'm fine.

19:54.791 --> 19:57.208
- I'll see you later.
- Jessie's dropping you back?

19:57.208 --> 20:00.083
Yes, Mum.
Yes. Love you. Bye.

20:00.583 --> 20:01.916
Love you. Bye.

20:11.291 --> 20:12.791
Hey! How are you?

20:12.791 --> 20:14.708
Hello, my darling.
Sorry we're late.

20:14.708 --> 20:15.625
No worries.

20:15.625 --> 20:17.958
Barry's busy...

20:17.958 --> 20:19.875
Place is looking gorgeous.

20:20.375 --> 20:22.708
<i>Wow, the spices.
Really, so yummy.</i>

20:22.708 --> 20:24.541
I don't know how you do it, Neve.

20:24.541 --> 20:26.791
Barry's always complaining
about my boiled chicken.

20:26.791 --> 20:29.125
- Is he?
-  You have to teach me.

20:29.125 --> 20:31.750
You'll have to teach me
one of your secret concoctions.

20:31.750 --> 20:33.791
- We could make a night of it.
- We could.

20:37.041 --> 20:38.041
Shall we?

20:38.958 --> 20:40.458
He's a freethinker.

20:40.458 --> 20:41.791
He's talking about things

20:41.791 --> 20:44.416
that the mainstream media
are scared to touch.

20:44.416 --> 20:45.583
He's hitting a nerve.

20:46.375 --> 20:49.750
"White flight."
That's how he phrased it on the podcast.

20:51.750 --> 20:53.791
- What is it?
-  Can we talk about something else?

20:53.791 --> 20:57.583
It's when white people
flee urban areas for the suburbs.

20:57.583 --> 21:00.000
- Why are they fleeing?
-  Because they're uncultured.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.875
It has nothing to do with culture.

21:04.625 --> 21:07.083
- What's that? At the window.
-  Love?

21:07.083 --> 21:09.583
-  At the window!
-  Can't see anything.

21:11.250 --> 21:13.625
Something's coming.
Someone's there. Can't you see?

21:13.625 --> 21:15.458
-  What?
-  Someone's coming!

21:24.041 --> 21:25.833
- Hey.
-  Hey.

21:25.833 --> 21:29.458
Hey! Oh, look at you!
I love your hair like that.

21:29.458 --> 21:31.666
Oh, it's very... very...

21:31.666 --> 21:32.875
Ethnic.

21:32.875 --> 21:34.333
- Barry, really?
- What?

21:34.333 --> 21:35.541
It suits you.

21:36.291 --> 21:37.875
Don't you think, Neve?

21:39.958 --> 21:41.833
Yes. Yes.

21:43.541 --> 21:44.958
Who did your hair like that?

21:46.125 --> 21:48.208
- Emily.
-  Where's your brother?

21:48.833 --> 21:49.958
Basketball.

21:50.625 --> 21:52.875
I think it's time we made a move.
Was lovely.

21:52.875 --> 21:55.166
Yes.
Wouldn't want to overstay our welcome.

21:55.166 --> 21:56.291
Get ready for bed, darling.

21:58.833 --> 22:01.083
-  Night, sweetheart.
-  Night.

22:03.166 --> 22:04.666
Thanks for coming.

22:10.833 --> 22:13.541
-  What time does basketball finish?

22:16.375 --> 22:19.416
He attended basketball.
Had a great game, apparently.

22:19.416 --> 22:22.583
Uh, the others went for some food after
to celebrate the win,

22:22.583 --> 22:24.125
but Sebastian didn't attend.

22:24.750 --> 22:25.708
And this was?

22:26.750 --> 22:27.875
Three hours ago.

22:28.833 --> 22:29.666
See?

22:30.333 --> 22:34.125
There are people out to hurt us.
Out to bring violence against us.

22:34.708 --> 22:37.458
Who's out to bring violence against us?

22:37.458 --> 22:39.625
What is wrong with you tonight? Really?

22:39.625 --> 22:41.083
Now, Neve, calm down.

22:41.083 --> 22:42.958
You know how these things are.

22:42.958 --> 22:46.708
Young boy's meeting a girl
after a good game, on the quiet.

22:46.708 --> 22:50.250
Eh, Ian? Doesn't want anyone
pulling the rug from under his feet.

22:50.250 --> 22:52.416
Yes. Yeah, if you like.

22:53.000 --> 22:56.125
Tell you what. I'll head out now
and do another round of the town.

22:56.625 --> 22:59.250
- I'm sure he'll turn up.
-  Thanks, Ken.

22:59.250 --> 23:01.666
<i>...so I'm pleased
this renovated farmhouse,</i>

23:01.666 --> 23:05.333

Where the hell have you been?!

23:16.583 --> 23:18.500
-  Out, man.
-  Out?!

23:19.083 --> 23:22.208
Out? You, you didn't call.
You didn't leave a message.

23:22.208 --> 23:23.875
We, we've been worried sick!

23:23.875 --> 23:26.958
Well, I'm back now,
so just chill!

23:27.708 --> 23:28.708
"Chill"?!

23:32.416 --> 23:34.750
Ah! Mum,
fucking what you doing?!

23:34.750 --> 23:36.916
Ow! Ow!

23:36.916 --> 23:39.041
Neve! Neve!

23:39.666 --> 23:41.041
Upstairs! Now!

25:37.708 --> 25:38.916

25:38.916 --> 25:40.583
Ideally, you'd let him go.

25:42.625 --> 25:43.875
In fact, just let him go.

25:45.416 --> 25:47.958
Did you see him
give Sebastian the cigarette?

25:47.958 --> 25:49.000
Yes.

25:51.291 --> 25:52.958
Well, where else did he get them?

25:52.958 --> 25:55.250
Uh, uh, I'm, I'm just saying,

No.

28:29.500 --> 28:32.416
- You want me gone?
- Please, it's not what you think.

28:33.291 --> 28:34.333
You erased me.

28:35.583 --> 28:36.583
Me and Dione.

28:37.416 --> 28:40.125
You erased us! We thought you were dead!

- Thanks so much.

29:26.750 --> 29:28.375
-  Really appreciate...
- So nice.

29:28.375 --> 29:30.625
Of course.
My pleasure. Hello, darling.

29:30.625 --> 29:34.666
-  Excuse me. Ready to speak?
-  Yes, two minutes. You okay, babe?

29:34.666 --> 29:35.875
Yeah. Good luck.

29:37.458 --> 29:38.875

Welcome to our home.

30:11.750 --> 30:16.291
A massive thank you to you all
for making generous contributions,

30:16.916 --> 30:21.000
Today, we dedicate our time
to those less fortunate,

30:22.083 --> 30:24.833
growing up in barren terrains,

30:25.416 --> 30:29.166
where access to the basics
becomes a gargantuan struggle.

30:30.166 --> 30:32.791
Where simple eye or ear infections

30:32.791 --> 30:35.666
can lead to blindness and deafness.

30:35.666 --> 30:38.791
When a simple course of antibiotics

30:38.791 --> 30:43.291
could afford that child
a life of seeing the sunrise

30:43.291 --> 30:45.333
and hearing the birds sing...

30:47.125 --> 30:48.250
in the morning.

30:55.541 --> 30:59.333
As an ode
to these unfortunate individuals,

30:59.333 --> 31:04.833
our very own choir will perform
"The Dream of Gerontius" in sign.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.250

37:13.708 --> 37:16.041
It's bringing it all together,
my time here.

37:16.708 --> 37:18.250
A graduation of sorts.

37:18.958 --> 37:20.875
And a chance
to show off the new kitchen?

37:20.875 --> 37:22.625
Well, that too, obviously.

37:29.250 --> 37:31.500
Let's see.
What kind of experience do you have?

37:32.375 --> 37:34.541
I haven't been down to London in a while.

37:38.208 --> 37:39.875
You found my tribe.

37:41.708 --> 37:42.541
Tribe.

37:43.333 --> 37:44.166
That's funny.

37:47.708 --> 37:49.083
You remind me of her.

37:50.041 --> 37:50.875
My wife.

37:52.875 --> 37:53.708
Same nose.

37:56.250 --> 37:57.916
<i>The school has a great history.</i>

37:57.916 --> 38:00.625
It was commissioned by Queen Victoria.

38:00.625 --> 38:01.541
Great.

38:02.416 --> 38:04.208
I worked a few period buildings abroad.

38:05.333 --> 38:06.541
You travel far?

38:06.541 --> 38:08.125
I've moved around a lot.

38:09.125 --> 38:10.833
Denmark, Brussels.

38:11.958 --> 38:13.375
Liverpool.

38:13.875 --> 38:14.708
Yeah?

38:15.583 --> 38:16.416
Do you follow?

38:18.041 --> 38:20.250
Some of my best days
were sat in the Kop end,

38:20.250 --> 38:23.166
20,000 strong, sucking the ball
into the back of the net.

38:25.875 --> 38:26.708
Good man.

38:27.416 --> 38:29.458
Hey. The only color that matters.

38:30.125 --> 38:31.041
Team colors.

38:31.791 --> 38:32.666
Exactly.

39:04.125 --> 39:05.583
Uh... Hi?

39:06.333 --> 39:08.250
Ian's... daughter, right?

39:08.916 --> 39:10.708
Yeah. How do you...

39:10.708 --> 39:13.041
I saw your photograph. In the shop.

39:14.041 --> 39:16.875
- I'm working there until I get on my feet.
- Okay.

39:17.625 --> 39:19.791
The glamour of insurance.

39:21.291 --> 39:23.916
- My dad certainly thinks so.
- I like your hair.

39:24.791 --> 39:26.125
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

39:26.125 --> 39:28.041
I sometimes rock mine like that.

39:28.958 --> 39:31.166

39:32.625 --> 39:36.333

39:37.208 --> 39:38.500
Uh... I like yours too.

39:39.375 --> 39:40.208
Coconut oil.

39:42.083 --> 39:43.458
We should... hang sometime.

39:44.041 --> 39:45.416
- Swap recipes.
- Sure.

39:46.000 --> 39:46.833
Cool.

39:47.750 --> 39:49.875
I'll Facebook you. You got an alias?

39:50.791 --> 39:52.875
Um, not quite an alias. Just Mary.

39:53.375 --> 39:56.083
Williams. With a hashtag at the end.

39:56.083 --> 39:57.708
So, sort of, maybe.

40:02.583 --> 40:04.541
Name's Abigail.

40:07.000 --> 40:07.833
But you

40:09.166 --> 40:10.000
can call me Abi.

40:19.291 --> 40:20.125
Say nuttin'.

40:43.750 --> 40:46.333
A parking ticket, yes. Exactly.

40:47.708 --> 40:50.125
What address is the vehicle registered to?

40:51.041 --> 40:54.416
I share the car with my wife,
and we recently had a breakup, you see.

40:56.375 --> 40:57.250
Thank you.

40:58.500 --> 41:00.208
That's the usual address.

41:00.833 --> 41:03.208
I'll just tear up the ticket. Great.

41:11.083 --> 41:12.333
Got the address.

41:12.833 --> 41:15.291
- She hasn't accepted my request.
- Just be patient.

41:15.291 --> 41:17.791
I can't look at her photos
unless she accepts it!

41:19.750 --> 41:20.666
We're friends!

41:22.333 --> 41:25.041
Don't forget why we came here. You get?

41:27.833 --> 41:29.166
-  Meanie.
-  What?

41:29.166 --> 41:30.250
Meanie!

41:35.833 --> 41:38.291
So, yes, I'd just had tea
with Amanda, and I...

41:39.208 --> 41:41.083
No phones at the table, Mary.

43:04.583 --> 43:06.791
Where's your mum at?
Been dreaming about her.

43:06.791 --> 43:07.708
Sod off.

43:07.708 --> 43:11.708
Ooh! Let me know
when you're ready to man up, freak.

43:21.250 --> 43:24.083
-  Off to class with you.
-  Fuckin' inbreds.

43:27.333 --> 43:28.791
So many haters around, innit?

43:29.750 --> 43:31.458
Yeah. Haters.

43:33.583 --> 43:36.333
- It's what happens when you're different.
-  Sebas.

43:37.166 --> 43:38.041
Sebastian!

43:40.833 --> 43:43.041
It's kinda shit
when your mum's the deputy head.

43:47.166 --> 43:49.125
- Marvin.
- Sebastian.

43:49.666 --> 43:51.666
I'll catch you later, Sebas.

43:52.958 --> 43:54.083
Yeah, man.

44:10.416 --> 44:12.500
Shouldn't let people
treat you like that.

44:17.125 --> 44:18.166
Here's good.

44:20.250 --> 44:23.833
- You got a light?
- Uh... I didn't think that...

44:23.833 --> 44:25.000
Just kidding.

44:25.000 --> 44:26.666
Okay, cool.

44:27.833 --> 44:29.083
It's all white label now.

44:29.875 --> 44:30.708
No graphics.

44:32.041 --> 44:33.375
Like that's gonna stop us.

44:34.083 --> 44:34.916
Right?

44:35.916 --> 44:36.750
Hell, no.

44:50.416 --> 44:53.166
Oh, you...
Take that down, man. Yo, like this.

45:13.000 --> 45:14.083
Now you.

45:29.500 --> 45:31.416
Yeah, there you go.

45:32.041 --> 45:33.125
That's that man shit.

45:44.583 --> 45:45.916
Who gave you that?!

45:48.750 --> 45:50.291
- Where is he?
-  Who?

45:50.291 --> 45:53.166
Who? This is the game
you wanna play with me?

45:53.166 --> 45:55.666
-  I bought them.
-  Don't treat me like a fool!

46:01.625 --> 46:03.250
Brotherly Cover, how can I help?

46:06.750 --> 46:07.583
Okay.

46:09.916 --> 46:10.750
Right.

46:14.541 --> 46:16.083
Did it sever off completely?

46:22.625 --> 46:23.583
Yes, yes, yes!

46:38.166 --> 46:40.750
- See you later.
-  Jessie's dropping you back?

46:40.750 --> 46:43.125
Yes, Mum.
Yes. Love you. Bye.

46:43.125 --> 46:44.291
Love you. Bye.

47:06.708 --> 47:08.333
-  Hi.
-  How are you?

47:08.333 --> 47:09.875
I'm good. How are you?

47:10.541 --> 47:13.541
Good. I'm good.
I'm excited for this party.

48:06.875 --> 48:08.750
Ah, man, it just clicked.

48:09.500 --> 48:11.458
Did good, man. You did good.

48:11.458 --> 48:15.125
Thanks, man. And I thought it was dope
when you whistled.

48:15.125 --> 48:16.083
You bun?

48:16.625 --> 48:17.458
Zoot.

48:18.625 --> 48:19.541
Um...

48:22.166 --> 48:24.625
First time for everything.
Ain't no shame in that.

48:27.250 --> 48:28.291
Let's find a spot.

48:28.958 --> 48:35.125
<i>♪ And I answered
Oh Lord God, thou knowest ♪</i>

48:39.625 --> 48:42.583
<i>♪ Oh Lord God... ♪</i>

48:43.333 --> 48:45.208
I swear...

48:47.125 --> 48:49.583
Yo, this is some <i>Alice-in-Wonderland</i> shit.

48:50.166 --> 48:52.208
Let us see what's in here.

48:52.208 --> 48:55.166
Pick what you want. Try anything.

48:56.000 --> 48:57.750
It's a par-ty!

48:57.750 --> 49:00.041
- Whoo-whoo!
- Whoo-whoo!

49:03.500 --> 49:05.708
Just look at all these cakes. We're like...

49:07.000 --> 49:09.166
...ladies at tea.

49:11.500 --> 49:14.041
My head's spinning, man. Oh!

49:16.916 --> 49:17.833
Yellow dress.

49:18.791 --> 49:19.833
Versace.

49:21.208 --> 49:23.666
- You'd look killer in it.
- I'll wear it to prom.

49:24.583 --> 49:25.458
Prom?

49:26.791 --> 49:30.000
- Prom like in the movies?
- Yeah. You never been to one?

49:30.000 --> 49:30.916
I...

49:32.250 --> 49:34.333
- We never...
- My mum's throwing a gala.

49:34.333 --> 49:35.833
You should totally come.

49:36.333 --> 49:40.541
It'll be fussy, but there'll be
a lot of free food and drink.

49:42.875 --> 49:44.250
This is cool!

49:44.250 --> 49:46.250
What do you reckon, homie?

49:49.166 --> 49:53.625
<i>And I answered, "Oh Lord God" ♪</i>

49:53.625 --> 49:55.250
<i>"Thou Knowest" ♪</i>

50:06.833 --> 50:07.958
You're the favorite.

50:10.458 --> 50:12.500
I bet you've always... been the favorite.

50:12.500 --> 50:14.000
- Right?
- Not really.

50:14.000 --> 50:15.500
She tucks you into bed.

50:16.000 --> 50:18.208
And sings to you when you sleep,
doesn't she?

50:18.208 --> 50:19.250
Wait, what? Who?

50:19.250 --> 50:23.416
And that makes it all right
when the meanies are out and about.

50:24.041 --> 50:24.875
Shut up.

50:27.333 --> 50:28.166
Can't wait

50:29.125 --> 50:30.083
till this all

50:30.625 --> 50:32.458
comes out.

50:34.208 --> 50:36.416
- Are you all right, Abi?
- Yeah.

50:37.291 --> 50:38.875
Just got to go to the bathroom.

50:45.916 --> 50:47.500
So, what brings you to Combe?

50:48.208 --> 50:50.333
Thought I'd add
some color to the place.

50:50.833 --> 50:53.916
Yeah, there ain't no other Blacks around.

50:55.625 --> 50:58.041
No. I mean, I guess I'm kinda...

50:59.208 --> 51:01.125
- Yeah?
- My mum.

51:05.125 --> 51:06.333
I never met my parents.

51:18.750 --> 51:19.583
What's she like?

51:20.541 --> 51:21.375
Who?

51:22.250 --> 51:23.083
Your mum?

51:25.208 --> 51:28.291
Thinks she's white.
Never says anything about her past.

51:29.250 --> 51:31.916
- The fuck?
- Anything Black, off limits.

51:45.041 --> 51:47.458
Shit, man. This weed is strong.

51:48.208 --> 51:49.166
Where'd you get it?

51:57.166 --> 51:58.916
You think you'd survive that drop?

52:00.375 --> 52:01.375
Huh?

52:03.125 --> 52:04.625
Do you think you'd survive it?

52:05.750 --> 52:06.583
Go on.

52:07.958 --> 52:09.666
- What?
-  Have a look.

52:11.750 --> 52:14.083
Lean over the edge and have a look.

52:15.541 --> 52:17.541
- Why?
- I thought you were on this man shit!

52:20.583 --> 52:21.416
Stand up.

52:22.583 --> 52:23.541
Look over the edge.

52:24.166 --> 52:25.000
Now.

52:25.875 --> 52:26.750
That's an order.

53:37.041 --> 53:37.916
All right.

53:42.625 --> 53:43.583
Well done, bruv.

53:44.500 --> 53:45.333
Well done.

53:47.458 --> 53:48.333
Passed the test.

53:52.083 --> 53:53.875
Now you're ready for the next level.

53:58.333 --> 54:02.500
Listen. He missed a shot. Yeah?

54:26.750 --> 54:27.666
Hello?

54:49.541 --> 54:50.375
Sebas?

54:56.833 --> 54:59.708
- You need to stop picking on my bro.

55:02.958 --> 55:05.041
Do it, Sebas. Do it now!

55:07.333 --> 55:09.416
What the fuck are you waiting for?

55:09.416 --> 55:11.208
-  Do it!

55:41.458 --> 55:42.916
What's been goin' on here?

55:43.750 --> 55:44.958
She has everything.

55:46.791 --> 55:48.083
She has it all.

55:49.083 --> 55:51.791
- Who?
-  We had a party here.

55:52.583 --> 55:55.750
Me and Mary, the favorite.

56:00.833 --> 56:01.916
You brought her here?

56:03.541 --> 56:04.708
What is wrong with you?

56:04.708 --> 56:06.541
- That wasn't the plan.
- Ah! Nothing!

56:07.041 --> 56:11.000
Nothing's wrong with me, okay?
I'm done pretending.

56:29.041 --> 56:30.000
We should just go.

56:31.958 --> 56:33.333
We should up and leave now.

56:35.083 --> 56:35.958
We're not wanted.

56:39.333 --> 56:41.333
We've been invited to the gala.

56:43.375 --> 56:44.416
So?

56:47.750 --> 56:48.583
So...

56:53.000 --> 56:54.541

This is all you! It's all you!

Get off me! It's all you!

58:07.000 --> 58:08.875
No! Why?!

58:08.875 --> 58:12.625
No, you didn't let me get one day!

58:12.625 --> 58:13.916
Get off me!

58:13.916 --> 58:16.000
One day!

58:16.000 --> 58:19.500
No! Get off!

58:40.291 --> 58:41.208
Is it true?

58:48.750 --> 58:49.583
Y...

58:50.583 --> 58:51.416
Yes.

58:53.958 --> 58:55.416
It's not what you think.

58:55.416 --> 58:56.708
Then how is it, Neve?

58:57.208 --> 58:59.833
It looks to me
like your two Black children just showed...

58:59.833 --> 59:01.208
- See?
-"See"?

59:01.958 --> 59:05.791
"See?" This is somehow on me?
You're, you're, you're gonna explain...

59:05.791 --> 59:09.500
-  Why didn't you tell us?
- They grew up with their father. He...

59:10.208 --> 59:11.625
He was a bad man. I...

59:13.458 --> 59:15.708
I had to escape, so I, I, I, just...

59:15.708 --> 59:16.625
Left.

59:18.500 --> 59:19.708
You just...

59:20.791 --> 59:21.625
left them.

59:22.666 --> 59:23.875
Who <i>are</i> you?

59:24.833 --> 59:26.625
- I'm, uh...
- This is fucked.

59:27.166 --> 59:31.083
- This is so, so fucked!
- Let her explain. Mum, tell us how...

59:31.083 --> 59:33.583
Don't make out
you would have been up for raising

59:33.583 --> 59:35.875
two <i>Black</i> children who weren't yours, Ian!

59:35.875 --> 59:38.250
- You never asked.
- Well, neither did you.

59:38.875 --> 59:41.000
No. No, that's not fair.

59:41.000 --> 59:42.625
I could have. Um... Maybe?

59:42.625 --> 59:43.708
Exactly.

59:44.208 --> 59:45.583
Exactly, Ian.

59:46.791 --> 59:48.125
The two worlds don't mix.

59:49.083 --> 59:50.125
And I, I, I...

59:50.625 --> 59:52.166
I did what I had to do.

59:52.791 --> 59:55.041
What fathers do all the time.

1:00:04.500 --> 1:00:05.416
What do they want?

1:00:06.875 --> 1:00:08.583
No, they haven't gone about things

1:00:09.083 --> 1:00:10.041
conventionally.

1:00:14.958 --> 1:00:16.166
You never recognized them?

1:00:18.625 --> 1:00:20.208
It was 16, 17 years ago.

1:00:20.208 --> 1:00:21.625
Oh, fuck.

1:00:22.583 --> 1:00:24.208
- Fuck, man!
- Stop it.

1:00:24.208 --> 1:00:25.750
-  That's enough.
- Please.

1:00:29.750 --> 1:00:31.625
There is something that I have to do.

1:00:33.833 --> 1:00:35.750
I will explain everything afterwards.

1:00:47.666 --> 1:00:49.791
Hey. Can I get you guys anything?

1:00:50.750 --> 1:00:53.125
- We're waiting on someone.
-  Sure, sure.

1:00:53.125 --> 1:00:55.541
Just let me know
when your third party arrives.

1:01:37.333 --> 1:01:38.916
Hi. Hi.

1:01:41.125 --> 1:01:42.541
So sorry, I'm...

1:01:46.583 --> 1:01:49.416
Have you ordered anything?
Is there anything you want?

1:01:51.500 --> 1:01:52.333
Take a seat.

1:02:00.125 --> 1:02:02.208
Thanks.

1:02:08.333 --> 1:02:10.583
- Thanks for agreeing to meet with me.
-  Hey, team!

1:02:10.583 --> 1:02:13.750
Specials are at the bottom.
Can I get you anything to drink?

1:02:13.750 --> 1:02:14.666
Vodka.

1:02:14.666 --> 1:02:15.791
Vod... Oh.

1:02:17.125 --> 1:02:19.833
- We don't stock alcohol...
- Just... Maybe just some tea.

1:02:21.333 --> 1:02:22.791
Guys? Tea?

1:02:22.791 --> 1:02:23.708
Whatever.

1:02:25.125 --> 1:02:26.458
Great. Bring a pot.

1:02:38.000 --> 1:02:38.833
Wow.

1:02:39.625 --> 1:02:40.500
Look at you both.

1:02:41.875 --> 1:02:44.791
- I hardly recognized you.
- What happened to your accent?

1:02:44.791 --> 1:02:46.916
- Do you hate being Black?
- No.

1:02:47.583 --> 1:02:49.041
That's what bro says.

1:02:49.541 --> 1:02:51.500
No, no, I'm a proud Black woman.

1:02:52.583 --> 1:02:53.416
Proud.

1:03:01.958 --> 1:03:03.250
Look, firstly,

1:03:04.541 --> 1:03:05.958
please let me apologize.

1:03:06.583 --> 1:03:08.583
I'm so sorry for my outburst. I...

1:03:09.333 --> 1:03:10.916
I don't know what came over me.

1:03:11.541 --> 1:03:13.458
I've been under
the most amount of stress, and...

1:03:13.458 --> 1:03:14.375
You...

1:03:15.666 --> 1:03:16.583
want to say sorry?

1:03:16.583 --> 1:03:17.541
Exactly.

1:03:18.083 --> 1:03:19.083
Exactly, Dione.

1:03:20.250 --> 1:03:21.625
That's what I'm here to do.

1:03:23.875 --> 1:03:26.375
It hasn't been
a straightforward journey.

1:03:27.083 --> 1:03:29.708
There have been things
that have happened that...

1:03:30.625 --> 1:03:31.583
that drew my hand...

1:03:31.583 --> 1:03:33.500
- You never reached out.

1:03:35.250 --> 1:03:38.208
You said you were going
to the hairdressers, 18 years ago.

1:03:38.208 --> 1:03:42.208
- Your father, he was a very dangerous man.
- You weren't exactly perfect either.

1:03:42.208 --> 1:03:44.958
I don't know if you remember
what it was like.

1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:47.750
- On Coldharbour?
- Is that a trick question?

1:03:47.750 --> 1:03:49.250
-  No, I...
- Why...

1:03:50.666 --> 1:03:54.208
- Why didn't you take us with you?
- I left you with your auntie.

1:03:54.208 --> 1:03:55.250
She gave us away.

1:03:55.791 --> 1:03:56.791
She didn't want us.

1:03:56.791 --> 1:03:59.708
Careful, guys!
The tea is super hot.

1:03:59.708 --> 1:04:02.916
- Don't want anybody to scald themselves.
- Would you fuck off!

1:04:04.750 --> 1:04:05.583
Sure.

1:04:20.041 --> 1:04:20.958
You're both right.

1:04:22.500 --> 1:04:23.625
It's unacceptable.

1:04:24.458 --> 1:04:27.083
I should have written.
I should have reached out.

1:04:27.708 --> 1:04:29.375
There are so many "should'ves."

1:04:29.958 --> 1:04:34.625
I can't imagine what you must think of me.
I'm still struggling to process it myself.

1:04:34.625 --> 1:04:36.375
Are we... going to move in?

1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:38.875
To the big house?

1:04:39.500 --> 1:04:41.125
That's...

1:04:42.625 --> 1:04:44.333
that's a very important question.

1:04:45.541 --> 1:04:48.208
And I've been thinking
of how I can make things right.

1:04:50.291 --> 1:04:52.791
And it appears to me that, right now,

1:04:52.791 --> 1:04:56.000
it's important that you both
are able to get back on your feet.

1:05:01.791 --> 1:05:03.083
I wish I could give more.

1:05:03.625 --> 1:05:05.791
Maybe I can. Down the line.

1:05:07.000 --> 1:05:07.916
But here's a check.

1:05:08.750 --> 1:05:10.041
For £20,000.

1:05:14.541 --> 1:05:16.166
- A check?
- Yes.

1:05:16.791 --> 1:05:18.708
If you go back to London,

1:05:19.500 --> 1:05:21.791
it will give you a chance
to get back on your feet.

1:05:22.541 --> 1:05:23.500
Until, uh...

1:05:24.083 --> 1:05:24.958
Until...

1:05:26.916 --> 1:05:28.875
we... work it all out?

1:05:30.208 --> 1:05:31.041
Exactly.

1:05:31.583 --> 1:05:32.916
Exactly, Dione.

1:05:34.250 --> 1:05:36.916
Until we can find a way
to work it all out.

1:05:41.291 --> 1:05:43.333
Wow. Look at you both.

1:05:44.791 --> 1:05:46.708
How you've grown.

1:05:49.666 --> 1:05:52.208
I've broken it down
into two separate checks

1:05:52.708 --> 1:05:54.208
to avoid arguments.

1:06:18.583 --> 1:06:19.708
Thank you, Mum.

1:06:50.916 --> 1:06:53.000
<i>There's no excuse for my behavior.</i>

1:06:55.250 --> 1:06:56.083
I was...

1:06:57.666 --> 1:06:58.708
traumatized

1:06:59.875 --> 1:07:01.208
after the second birth.

1:07:01.833 --> 1:07:03.083
I never even wanted her.

1:07:04.291 --> 1:07:05.125
Dione.

1:07:06.916 --> 1:07:07.750
I was forced.

1:07:09.333 --> 1:07:11.833
Who knows what would have happened
if I'd stayed?

1:07:12.625 --> 1:07:13.791
If I'd be here now.

1:07:15.041 --> 1:07:16.250
If <i>you'd</i> be here, even.

1:07:22.375 --> 1:07:23.291
And so I ran.

1:07:24.833 --> 1:07:25.666
Escaped.

1:07:28.375 --> 1:07:29.583
It wasn't planned. I...

1:07:31.625 --> 1:07:33.625
I saw an opportunity, and I went for it.

1:07:34.250 --> 1:07:35.208
All this

1:07:35.916 --> 1:07:37.833
is just restless curiosity.

1:07:40.000 --> 1:07:41.958
People need to know who they are.

1:07:43.041 --> 1:07:46.250
Where they're from.
Like... on those programs.

1:07:47.750 --> 1:07:49.375
It doesn't change anything here.

1:07:53.291 --> 1:07:54.500
They've gone.

1:07:54.500 --> 1:07:55.583
For now.

1:07:56.541 --> 1:07:57.541
Back to London.

1:08:00.875 --> 1:08:02.458
They just went?

1:08:03.375 --> 1:08:04.208
Mmm.

1:08:05.708 --> 1:08:06.916
They decided to leave.

1:08:08.666 --> 1:08:12.041
- Will we ever see them again?
- Don't you even want to?

1:08:12.041 --> 1:08:13.750
All in good time.

1:08:16.583 --> 1:08:18.291
We need to heal a bit first.

1:08:19.000 --> 1:08:20.000
Don't we?

1:08:21.166 --> 1:08:22.666
Before jumping into all that.

1:08:25.541 --> 1:08:28.916
Now it's important to rebuild our defenses

1:08:28.916 --> 1:08:31.333
and remember that we love each other.

1:08:32.333 --> 1:08:33.541
That <i>this</i> is real.

1:08:34.833 --> 1:08:36.666
That I am real.

1:08:47.833 --> 1:08:48.875
Your mother's right.

1:08:50.208 --> 1:08:51.291
We are a family.

1:08:52.333 --> 1:08:54.541
Whatever happened before
doesn't change that.

1:08:56.000 --> 1:08:58.333
There will be
many more conversations to come.

1:09:00.250 --> 1:09:01.291
Believe you me.

1:09:03.958 --> 1:09:04.958
But, for now...

1:09:07.333 --> 1:09:08.625
we have to stay together.

1:09:21.750 --> 1:09:22.750
Mary.

1:09:32.791 --> 1:09:33.625
Son?

1:13:48.375 --> 1:13:51.958
<i>Together,
they can better defend their territory.</i>

1:13:51.958 --> 1:13:54.500
<i>Now this is... Gosh, this is...</i>

1:13:54.500 --> 1:13:57.500
<i>This ring is astonishing!</i>

1:13:57.500 --> 1:13:59.041
<i>It is one of the nicest...</i>

1:13:59.041 --> 1:14:01.666
<i>Oh my gosh, look at this ring!</i>

1:14:01.666 --> 1:14:03.500
<i>- Three quarters of a carat...
-</i>

1:14:23.333 --> 1:14:24.333
Hey, Sebas.

1:14:31.375 --> 1:14:34.875
-  Think I might have a bath.
-  Have you got a clean towel?

1:14:35.708 --> 1:14:36.916
Couldn't find any.

1:14:39.833 --> 1:14:42.208
What are you doing,
taking a bath at this hour?

1:14:44.458 --> 1:14:45.500
They're downstairs.

1:14:57.208 --> 1:14:58.916
Know where
the clean towels are kept?

1:14:59.416 --> 1:15:02.625
I checked the cupboards
but couldn't find any clean ones.

1:15:03.416 --> 1:15:04.541
Right, okay.

1:15:05.666 --> 1:15:07.500
You never mentioned you were coming round.

1:15:07.500 --> 1:15:09.000
It's Abigail's birthday.

1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:11.500
We thought it would be a great idea
to bring it in together.

1:15:11.500 --> 1:15:12.958
Maybe order Chinese.

1:15:12.958 --> 1:15:15.166
I love Chinese food!

1:15:15.166 --> 1:15:17.333
Sebas! What you sayin', bro?

1:15:18.000 --> 1:15:20.083
- Didn't mean to wake you.
-  Hey, M!

1:15:20.083 --> 1:15:21.250
Like your PJs.

1:15:22.041 --> 1:15:23.875
Hi, Ian. Guess what?

1:15:24.500 --> 1:15:25.500
It's my birthday!

1:15:25.500 --> 1:15:28.416
- Please, I know how you must be...
-  Where do you keep clean towels?

1:15:28.416 --> 1:15:31.708
Is it washday, Mum? Ian, washday?

1:15:31.708 --> 1:15:33.750
- I know that you're angry...
-  Sis!

1:15:34.375 --> 1:15:35.750
Send the menu around.

1:15:38.333 --> 1:15:40.208
We'll do it like that. On me.

1:15:41.291 --> 1:15:42.291
It's a celebration.

1:15:46.041 --> 1:15:46.875
Mum.

1:15:46.875 --> 1:15:47.958
Mum!

1:15:49.083 --> 1:15:51.541
I like the hair.
You bringing it back to the '90s?

1:15:57.625 --> 1:15:59.041
Chill.

1:15:59.041 --> 1:16:00.666
Or see what happens.

1:16:01.750 --> 1:16:02.750
Chill.

1:16:15.750 --> 1:16:16.583
Mmm!

1:16:17.500 --> 1:16:21.250
I'm going Singapore noodle
and sweet-and-sour chicken.

1:16:22.708 --> 1:16:23.708
Peking-style.

1:16:24.875 --> 1:16:27.916
Mary, go and get the house phone
so we can put the order in.

1:16:29.333 --> 1:16:30.208
You, Abs?

1:16:31.000 --> 1:16:32.000
Birthday girl.

1:16:36.541 --> 1:16:37.375
Ribs.

1:16:37.958 --> 1:16:38.791
Nice.

1:16:39.625 --> 1:16:40.583
Very nice.

1:16:41.250 --> 1:16:42.625
- With?
- Chow mein.

1:16:43.458 --> 1:16:44.375
Chicken chow mein.

1:16:44.375 --> 1:16:45.666
Who's getting this down?

1:16:46.625 --> 1:16:48.458
- Mary, you getting this?
-  Wait.

1:16:49.333 --> 1:16:52.666
I was totally unaware
of what happened in the past with Neve...

1:16:52.666 --> 1:16:54.333
You mean... Cheryl.

1:16:58.208 --> 1:16:59.583
You didn't know?

1:17:00.250 --> 1:17:02.625
Oh... It was a terrible mix-up.

1:17:03.750 --> 1:17:06.541
It's all just been a terrible confusion.
I mean, I...

1:17:06.541 --> 1:17:08.375
We don't condone what she did.

1:17:08.375 --> 1:17:10.708
We demanded answers too,
like the two of you.

1:17:10.708 --> 1:17:14.000
Now you, Sebas. I seen you on the court.
I know you got an appetite.

1:17:14.000 --> 1:17:15.708
- If we could just talk...
- Sebas!

1:17:16.958 --> 1:17:18.916
- What is it, bruv?

1:17:19.708 --> 1:17:20.583
Uh...

1:17:23.166 --> 1:17:26.083
Prawn crackers and egg-fried rice.

1:17:26.583 --> 1:17:28.166
Good. Very good.

1:17:29.458 --> 1:17:31.500
Gonna be a feast. I like.

1:17:33.166 --> 1:17:35.166
You lift weights? Ian.

1:17:38.166 --> 1:17:39.666
I clocked a gym back there.

1:17:39.666 --> 1:17:41.875
A gym, you know?
In the house.

1:17:43.000 --> 1:17:45.208
We should do a family photograph.

1:17:45.208 --> 1:17:48.208
After we sorted the order,
we can do a family photo.

1:17:49.208 --> 1:17:51.500
But it's my turn to be in the middle.

1:17:52.583 --> 1:17:54.041
That's non-negotiable, Mary.

1:17:55.125 --> 1:17:57.125
Mum, what you going for?

1:17:58.541 --> 1:18:02.625
- I'll just have a bit of everyone else's.
- You sure? I'm buying.

1:18:04.833 --> 1:18:06.708
Mary. Phone 'em up.

1:18:25.250 --> 1:18:27.125
Shall I turn the water off?

1:18:29.208 --> 1:18:30.083
Let it run.

1:18:31.458 --> 1:18:33.625
Let it run and run.

1:18:35.958 --> 1:18:37.791
<i>I'm sorry,
but we're currently closed.</i>

1:18:37.791 --> 1:18:41.625
<i>Our opening hours are 12:00 to 11:00,
Monday to Sunday. Please call back later.</i>

1:18:41.625 --> 1:18:42.625
No worries.

1:18:43.833 --> 1:18:44.708
Don't watch that.

1:18:52.250 --> 1:18:53.125
Uber Eats.

1:18:53.875 --> 1:18:56.291
They got Uber Eats in Castle Combe? Ian.

1:18:57.125 --> 1:18:59.000
- I believe so.
-  Good.

1:18:59.791 --> 1:19:02.166
Take my phone, Mary. You find a Chinese.

1:19:02.666 --> 1:19:03.500
Ian.

1:19:06.125 --> 1:19:08.125
Now... I know you must be hurting...

1:19:08.125 --> 1:19:09.166
Sorry.

1:19:11.958 --> 1:19:13.791
- Would you repeat?
- I know you must be in pain...

1:19:29.000 --> 1:19:30.250
Here you go.

1:19:30.250 --> 1:19:31.666
Ta. Thanks, Abi.

1:19:33.958 --> 1:19:35.666
Yep. I found a good one.

1:19:35.666 --> 1:19:37.083
That's my girl.

1:19:37.083 --> 1:19:39.416
Aren't you gonna
wish me happy birthday?

1:19:39.416 --> 1:19:41.625
Come on. It's her fucking birthday.

1:19:42.500 --> 1:19:45.333
Well, don't just stand there. Sing!

1:19:45.958 --> 1:19:49.333
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

1:19:50.000 --> 1:19:53.333
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

1:19:53.833 --> 1:19:57.833
-  <i>♪ Happy birthday, dear Dione ♪</i>
-  <i>♪ Happy birthday, dear Abi ♪</i>

1:19:58.791 --> 1:20:01.750
-  <i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>
-   <i>Dione ♪</i>

1:20:02.833 --> 1:20:04.583
- Hip hip!
-  Hooray.

1:20:10.250 --> 1:20:11.083
Nice.

1:20:18.666 --> 1:20:20.083
You play board games, right?

1:20:21.333 --> 1:20:23.125
At Christmas or birthdays.

1:20:25.208 --> 1:20:26.583
We got no board game ting.

1:20:28.875 --> 1:20:31.791
- We must've missed a fair few board games.
-  Mmm.

1:20:31.791 --> 1:20:33.916
On Christmases and birthdays.

1:20:35.875 --> 1:20:38.541
How many birthdays
is that anyway? Fifteen?

1:20:39.250 --> 1:20:40.500
Sixteen.

1:20:40.500 --> 1:20:41.458
Seventeen.

1:20:42.250 --> 1:20:43.291
Let's play Scrabble!

1:20:44.375 --> 1:20:45.625
I love Scrabble.

1:20:46.666 --> 1:20:47.875
You got Scrabble?

1:20:48.500 --> 1:20:49.458
Ian?

1:20:49.458 --> 1:20:52.083
Yes, I believe we have Scrabble somewhere.

1:20:52.083 --> 1:20:56.125
Sebas. You go with Abs and find
the board game while we set the table up.

1:20:58.458 --> 1:20:59.291
Mum?

1:21:00.333 --> 1:21:02.083
Set the fucking table, will ya?

1:21:13.708 --> 1:21:14.958
It's okay.

1:21:46.750 --> 1:21:48.666
Did you write the check or did she?

1:21:49.916 --> 1:21:51.083
I'm sorry?

1:21:52.416 --> 1:21:54.541
The 20K she just tried to buy us off with.

1:21:56.500 --> 1:21:58.125
You tried to pay them off?

1:21:58.125 --> 1:21:59.541
Mum, how could you?

1:21:59.541 --> 1:22:01.041
It wasn't intended to...

1:22:03.208 --> 1:22:05.791
We could have given more.
I was just trying to help.

1:22:05.791 --> 1:22:08.083
Neve, what the hell is wrong with you?

1:22:11.041 --> 1:22:11.958
Let's round it up.

1:22:13.416 --> 1:22:14.708
20K for 20 years.

1:22:15.791 --> 1:22:19.500
But what could I get for that?
It's about a grand for each year, right?

1:22:20.416 --> 1:22:21.750
You'd need to budget that.

1:22:22.583 --> 1:22:23.583
Let me see.

1:22:25.208 --> 1:22:26.208
Shoes on my feet.

1:22:28.250 --> 1:22:29.291
Getting sectioned.

1:22:30.583 --> 1:22:32.416
Wetting the bed until just recently.

1:22:32.416 --> 1:22:33.625
Found it!

1:22:34.750 --> 1:22:35.833
Let's play!

1:22:37.916 --> 1:22:39.791
What you buying back with yours, Abs?

1:22:41.250 --> 1:22:42.416
Please.

1:22:42.416 --> 1:22:43.875
I told you already.

1:22:43.875 --> 1:22:45.833
I'm paying off the meanies.

1:22:48.041 --> 1:22:49.666
And all the things they've done.

1:22:49.666 --> 1:22:52.416
You <i>do</i> that, sis!
You do exactly that!

1:22:54.250 --> 1:22:55.166
But for now,

1:22:56.250 --> 1:22:57.750
we're just buying back Cheryl.

1:22:59.041 --> 1:23:00.375
Isn't that what we agreed?

1:23:02.125 --> 1:23:03.041
Mum?

1:23:35.750 --> 1:23:36.583
Teams.

1:23:38.208 --> 1:23:39.541
Shall we do teams?

1:23:40.291 --> 1:23:41.125
Oh?

1:23:41.666 --> 1:23:43.625
This has always been a family favorite.

1:23:44.125 --> 1:23:47.583
Seems the perfect way
to introduce Carl and Dione to the flock.

1:23:49.541 --> 1:23:50.375
Yes.

1:23:51.541 --> 1:23:53.791
I see now,
this is as it should be, isn't it?

1:23:53.791 --> 1:23:56.375
With all of us gathered around.

1:23:57.208 --> 1:23:58.041
Ian?

1:23:59.083 --> 1:24:00.375
I want a divorce.

1:24:01.750 --> 1:24:02.833
It's over.

1:24:02.833 --> 1:24:04.166
Dad, stop it.

1:24:04.750 --> 1:24:05.583
Can't we try?

1:24:06.083 --> 1:24:07.333
Teams sounds good!

1:24:08.583 --> 1:24:10.083
I'll go with Dione.

1:24:10.083 --> 1:24:11.333
I'll go with Carl.

1:24:11.916 --> 1:24:14.083
That leaves Mum and Dad.

1:24:14.666 --> 1:24:17.208
Awesome. Fantastic. Hon?

1:24:45.541 --> 1:24:47.625
Mum? Dad? What have you got?

1:24:47.625 --> 1:24:49.208
Okay.

1:24:49.208 --> 1:24:50.250
Let's see.

1:24:50.250 --> 1:24:52.375
Let's see, what word do we have here?

1:24:52.375 --> 1:24:53.291
Ian?

1:24:54.458 --> 1:24:57.041
Yeah.
What have we got?

1:25:14.000 --> 1:25:15.083
"Rhino."

1:25:16.166 --> 1:25:18.500
- That's funny.
-  Isn't it just, darling?

1:25:18.500 --> 1:25:19.500
Me next!

1:25:20.333 --> 1:25:23.166
Let me know when you want to do
that photograph, Dione.

1:25:24.750 --> 1:25:25.958
Isn't she pretty, Mary?

1:25:27.958 --> 1:25:28.791
Uh-huh.

1:25:38.958 --> 1:25:39.791
"Tuna."

1:25:41.958 --> 1:25:43.041
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

1:25:44.083 --> 1:25:45.833
Okay. Um...

1:25:47.125 --> 1:25:47.958
So...

1:25:48.750 --> 1:25:50.583
-  What are you doing?!
-  Bored.

1:25:50.583 --> 1:25:53.500
I wanna play the game!
It's <i>my</i> birthday! I get to choose!

1:25:53.500 --> 1:25:58.166
-  I'm sure we can find another game.
- Me and Ian are gonna do a little workout.

1:25:58.166 --> 1:26:00.000
How about charades or something?

1:26:00.000 --> 1:26:02.416
Yeah! Charades are sick.

1:26:02.416 --> 1:26:03.708
Isn't it, Ian?

1:26:04.208 --> 1:26:05.291
Don't hurt him.

1:26:05.291 --> 1:26:06.208
Please.

1:26:07.041 --> 1:26:07.916
Hurt him?

1:26:09.458 --> 1:26:10.458
Why would I do that?

1:26:11.291 --> 1:26:13.708
We're family. Right, Ian?

1:26:17.958 --> 1:26:19.041
- Let's go.
- Ian!

1:26:19.041 --> 1:26:20.250
I'll be all right.

1:26:21.666 --> 1:26:22.541
I'll talk to him.

1:26:22.541 --> 1:26:24.791
What kinda KG
you pushing these days?

1:26:25.541 --> 1:26:26.916
- A bit.

1:26:27.416 --> 1:26:28.250
A bit?

1:26:28.916 --> 1:26:30.125
Must be more than a bit.

1:26:31.750 --> 1:26:32.625
Let's go.

1:26:39.208 --> 1:26:40.291
Talk's cheap, right?

1:26:41.458 --> 1:26:42.583
It's all in the doin'.

1:26:44.041 --> 1:26:44.916
Right, Mum?

1:28:14.041 --> 1:28:15.500
Early-morning munchies?

1:28:15.500 --> 1:28:18.541
Aren't you funny?
Yes, something like that.

1:28:20.166 --> 1:28:21.083
Don't I know you?

1:28:22.041 --> 1:28:24.041
Um, maybe. Don't know.

1:28:24.875 --> 1:28:27.458
Not sure I've delivered here before.
Nice house.

1:28:28.458 --> 1:28:31.583
We didn't think we'd find anywhere,
what with it being so late.

1:28:32.416 --> 1:28:34.791
Let me get you a tip
for being so accommodating.

1:28:36.666 --> 1:28:38.250
Everything okay?

1:28:39.208 --> 1:28:41.208
Wait there. Wait right there.

1:28:50.708 --> 1:28:51.708
Mmm!

1:28:52.208 --> 1:28:53.583
Smells yummy, doesn't it?

1:29:23.625 --> 1:29:24.875
- Sebas.

1:29:25.541 --> 1:29:26.916
Have you seen my purse?

1:29:28.208 --> 1:29:29.500
I don't know. Upstairs?

1:29:29.500 --> 1:29:31.750
- Yes, that's right. Well done.

1:29:45.708 --> 1:29:49.500
I can't. I can't.

1:29:51.375 --> 1:29:52.541
I can't!

1:29:55.458 --> 1:29:56.416
I can't.

1:29:58.416 --> 1:30:00.291
- Bit of a wuss?

1:30:06.958 --> 1:30:09.875
- You ain't walking away that easy.

1:30:09.875 --> 1:30:11.791
You made your bed with us.

1:30:13.958 --> 1:30:15.125
We're the same now.

1:30:42.041 --> 1:30:42.875
All good.

1:30:43.583 --> 1:30:44.416
All good.

1:30:45.500 --> 1:30:46.666
It was in the wardrobe.

1:30:53.958 --> 1:30:55.000
I'm sorry.

1:30:56.208 --> 1:30:58.416
I'm very sorry
for how this has turned out.

1:31:00.000 --> 1:31:01.708
I hope one day you can forgive me.

1:31:05.041 --> 1:31:08.000
Let me tip the man,
and then we'll eat and discuss.

1:31:36.000 --> 1:31:37.083
Mmm.

1:31:37.958 --> 1:31:38.958
It looks good.

1:31:44.708 --> 1:31:45.625
