00:03.770 --> 00:06.330
Hey. What are you guys up to?

00:06.406 --> 00:08.340
We're spending the weekend
at a hotel.

00:08.408 --> 00:11.900
What, car sex isn't
good enough anymore?

00:11.978 --> 00:13.912
I would love car sex.

00:16.049 --> 00:18.040
Or just sex.

00:19.986 --> 00:21.977
Or just a car.

00:23.723 --> 00:25.987
I have to get out of town.
Ever since my dad lost the store...

00:26.059 --> 00:29.825
he just shuffles around
in a not-completely-closed bathrobe.

00:29.896 --> 00:31.955
It's really depressing.

00:32.031 --> 00:34.694
"The Wisconsin Dells'
most romantic hideaway.

00:34.768 --> 00:37.703
Hunters and truckers
always welcome."

00:39.372 --> 00:42.637
- That's nice.
- Sounds awesome. I'm gonna go pack.

00:45.745 --> 00:49.374
You guys. The weirdest thing
just happened with Pam Macy.

00:49.449 --> 00:52.748
Kelso, man, she'll do that
with any guy standing in front of her.

00:55.021 --> 00:57.717
Okay. So, I'm making out
with Pam in the orchestra pit...

00:57.791 --> 01:01.283
and everything is progressin'
like normal until...

01:02.295 --> 01:05.162
- What?
- You know...

01:05.230 --> 01:09.725
the really, really bad thing that can
happen to guys when they're with girls.

01:11.204 --> 01:14.833
Oh, did Mr. Cooper come in
to buff the floor?

01:20.780 --> 01:23.044
No.

01:23.116 --> 01:25.243
Okay.

01:25.318 --> 01:27.252
Let me put it this way.

01:27.320 --> 01:30.551
The buffer wouldn't buff.

01:31.925 --> 01:34.223
Poor Mr. Cooper.

01:38.098 --> 01:40.999
No, Fez. I think
what he's tryin' to say is...

01:41.067 --> 01:43.058
the rabbit wouldn't
come out of the hat.

01:44.771 --> 01:46.671
The weasel wouldn't pop.

01:46.739 --> 01:49.037
The alphabet soup
never spelled "go."

01:50.310 --> 01:52.778
Okay! All right! Enough!

01:52.846 --> 01:55.280
Actually, not quite.
There are a lot of Amish people...

01:55.348 --> 01:57.282
but they never raised a barn.

02:01.888 --> 02:04.254
Forman, man,
that was awesome.

02:04.324 --> 02:07.293
Hey. It just came to me.

02:07.360 --> 02:10.591
Oh, I get it.
The barn is Kelso's pants.

02:13.032 --> 02:15.262
Okay! You guys, this is not funny!

02:15.335 --> 02:18.930
- This is, like, a nightmare.
- Yes. Eric, stop teasing.

02:19.005 --> 02:23.135
Kelso, I want you to know
that I feel bad for you...

02:23.209 --> 02:26.337
and that I am sorry...
you are not a man!

02:28.000 --> 02:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:10.023 --> 03:13.959
So, looks like I'm gonna spend
the weekend with Kelso... tutor him in math.

03:21.768 --> 03:24.430
Really.

03:24.504 --> 03:26.438
Hmm.

03:27.907 --> 03:32.105
So, you're allegedly
tutoring Kelso in math.

03:33.913 --> 03:36.939
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>
- Are you good in math?

03:38.384 --> 03:40.443
What's the square root of "x"?

03:42.255 --> 03:44.883
- <i>Um, I really can't answer that.</i>
- Aha!

03:44.958 --> 03:47.859
No. See, "x" is a variable,
so until you define its parameters...

03:47.927 --> 03:51.124
the only possible answer is a variable...
or "x" if you prefer.

03:54.634 --> 03:56.795
Is that right?

03:56.869 --> 03:59.770
Sounds good.

03:59.839 --> 04:02.239
- Will Michael's parents be home?
- <i>Yes.</i>

04:02.308 --> 04:05.835
Are they as dumb as he is?

04:05.912 --> 04:08.142
I can't lie. Yes.

04:09.415 --> 04:11.747
Yes, they are.

04:11.818 --> 04:14.446
Right answer.
That was a trick question.

04:16.221 --> 04:18.416
I know they're dumb.

04:20.493 --> 04:24.259
So, I can go?

04:24.330 --> 04:27.925
You can go,
but I'll be watching the news.

04:30.870 --> 04:33.270
And if anything is vandalized...

04:33.339 --> 04:35.273
or explodes...

04:35.341 --> 04:37.571
or catches on fire...

04:37.644 --> 04:41.102
"x" is gonna equal me
kicking your ass.

04:54.494 --> 04:59.329
So, anyway, Jackie's, uh,
havin' trouble in school stuff...

04:59.399 --> 05:02.334
and, uh, I thought I should
stay with her this weekend...

05:02.402 --> 05:04.927
tutor her in, you know, stuff.

05:07.206 --> 05:10.198
- Anyone?
- I'm sorry, honey.

05:10.276 --> 05:13.268
I can't concentrate when
your father's robe is open.

05:15.081 --> 05:17.845
Leave me alone.
I'm ventilating.

05:19.152 --> 05:20.949
Okay. See ya Sunday.

05:30.563 --> 05:32.497
<i>Jeannie, I'm home.</i>

05:32.565 --> 05:34.726
Oh.

05:34.801 --> 05:36.462
Hello, Genie Jackie.

05:36.536 --> 05:39.528
Hello, Master Major Michael.
How was your day?

05:39.605 --> 05:42.768
Pretty good, pretty good.
But I'm starvin'.

05:42.842 --> 05:44.833
I've been on the moon all day,
and I missed lunch.

05:45.878 --> 05:48.005
I can fix that.

05:50.149 --> 05:52.845
Damn. I love havin' a genie.

05:52.919 --> 05:55.547
- Well, let's eat.
- Okay.

05:55.621 --> 05:59.751
Unless you're hungry for
something besides food, Master.

06:02.328 --> 06:07.322
Actually, I'm havin' a little problem
in this department lately.

06:07.400 --> 06:09.425
Not anymore.

06:10.937 --> 06:15.169
Ho-ho! You're
the best genie ever!

06:28.755 --> 06:31.519
Hello? Pam?

06:31.591 --> 06:34.617
I'm back!

06:40.867 --> 06:44.166
You know, Red, with the house
empty this weekend...

06:44.237 --> 06:48.401
it might be a... a nice opportunity
for a little romance.

06:49.709 --> 06:51.768
Uh-huh.

06:55.181 --> 06:58.241
Is that, "Uh-huh,
my passion burns for you"...

06:58.317 --> 07:02.253
or "Uh-huh, you're
as exciting as an old hat"?

07:04.490 --> 07:07.288
Well, what kind of old hat?

07:07.360 --> 07:10.488
How about a hat that's about
to be super P.O.'d?

07:10.563 --> 07:13.691
Oh. Then the passion one.

07:16.869 --> 07:19.736
Okay. I'm gonna sneak some beer
outta the fridge. You go be lookout.

07:19.806 --> 07:22.001
You can count on me.

07:41.461 --> 07:44.157
Hyde, the Formans are home.

07:45.598 --> 07:49.534
- A little late, Fez.
- It's funnier this way.

07:52.305 --> 07:55.138
Okay, you two, out.

07:55.208 --> 07:58.700
Here. Here, you can each
have a Snack Pack.

08:03.416 --> 08:05.407
Thank you, Mrs. Forman.

08:08.521 --> 08:10.614
Ooh. Chocolate.

08:14.327 --> 08:16.659
Okay, Kitty.

08:16.729 --> 08:19.220
I'm gonna cook you
a romantic dinner.

08:19.298 --> 08:21.289
So, you go put on
something pretty...

08:21.367 --> 08:24.336
and I'll warm up the toaster oven.

08:24.403 --> 08:29.363
Oh, wow. Dinner from
the toaster oven. Ha ha.

08:29.442 --> 08:32.808
Well, whoop-de-do.
I'll put on my fancy dress.

08:34.380 --> 08:36.313
Okay. I'm gonna work
on Plan "B."

08:36.381 --> 08:38.246
Oh, I would.

08:43.422 --> 08:45.617
This place is awesome.

08:48.094 --> 08:51.029
I know. There's gotta be,
like, 17 pillows on this bed.

08:52.231 --> 08:54.165
What's this?

08:54.233 --> 08:57.031
Oh, my God.
It's a tiny fridge...

08:57.103 --> 09:00.300
with, like, a million bottles
of tiny liquor.

09:00.373 --> 09:05.242
And tiny cookies.

09:05.311 --> 09:10.305
Oh, yeah? Well, in there...
tiny shampoo and tiny soap.

09:10.383 --> 09:12.874
Donna, I think elves work here.

09:14.921 --> 09:17.583
I feel so classy.

09:17.657 --> 09:19.648
I'm stealing all of it.

09:30.403 --> 09:33.236
Look, Pam, I'm really sorry
about what happened...

09:34.574 --> 09:36.508
again.

09:36.576 --> 09:39.568
I must have the flu or something.

09:39.645 --> 09:42.910
Well, it's not like any flu
I've ever heard of.

09:42.982 --> 09:45.450
Well, there's lots of kinds
of flu, Pam!

09:47.954 --> 09:50.218
I'm sorry.

09:50.289 --> 09:52.849
Oh, well, don't take it so <i>hard.</i>

09:52.925 --> 09:54.916
Oops. Sorry.

09:57.129 --> 10:00.394
Look, just don't
tell anybody, okay?

10:00.466 --> 10:06.098
Oh, Flopsy, I'm not
gonna tell anybody.

10:06.172 --> 10:08.163
I'm gonna tell <i>everybody.</i>

10:11.243 --> 10:13.905
Eric.

10:15.948 --> 10:19.884
Do you know that if you mix KahlÃºa and
scotch, it tastes just like Dr. Pepper?

10:24.557 --> 10:26.752
You're cute.

10:29.662 --> 10:31.755
Okay.

10:33.666 --> 10:37.830
I think you're cute too...
and a little drunk...

10:39.038 --> 10:41.529
which is gonna make my job
a whole lot easier.

10:45.544 --> 10:47.478
What's that?

10:49.048 --> 10:52.108
- I guess the guy next door thinks we're being too loud.
- Oh, yeah?

10:52.184 --> 10:54.812
What...

10:57.056 --> 10:59.047
Oh, my God.
He just pounded right back.

11:00.626 --> 11:03.117
Uh, okay. You know what?
Let's just be quiet.

11:03.195 --> 11:05.129
But then he wins, Eric.

11:06.365 --> 11:08.833
We need to get the last pound.

11:12.872 --> 11:15.568
See? We won.
We're not gonna take crap.

11:15.641 --> 11:17.575
We're gonna give it,
'cause we're fearless.

11:17.643 --> 11:22.580
Oh, my God. He's at the door.

11:22.648 --> 11:24.980
Okay, you know what?
I think I have a little fear.

11:25.051 --> 11:28.919
So, let's just, uh, be really quiet
and pretend we're not here.

11:28.988 --> 11:31.479
- And maybe he'll just think we're not here.
- Okay.

11:33.125 --> 11:35.059
Will you cut it out!

11:37.096 --> 11:40.327
Okay, look, just
stay in here and shush.

11:40.399 --> 11:42.424
<i>Okay.</i>

11:49.442 --> 11:51.376
- Eric!
- Dad.

11:56.549 --> 11:58.483
Hey, it's Big Red.

11:59.752 --> 12:01.947
Son of a bitch!

12:09.895 --> 12:11.886
What the hell
are you doing here?

12:11.964 --> 12:15.161
Wait. What are <i>you</i> doing here?

12:15.234 --> 12:17.725
Oh, my God.
Who are you with?

12:18.804 --> 12:21.739
Your mother, you dumb-ass.

12:23.876 --> 12:26.037
Okay. I'm gonna make
a deal with you.

12:26.112 --> 12:28.740
I never saw you.
I don't know you're here.

12:28.814 --> 12:30.543
Wait. So we're good?

12:30.616 --> 12:33.312
No, no. You're gettin'
your ass kicked on Monday.

12:33.385 --> 12:36.149
But for now,
you shut up and stay here.

12:36.222 --> 12:39.385
If your mother sees you,
my fun time is over.

12:45.464 --> 12:47.489
Oh, this is just awful!

12:47.566 --> 12:51.058
Oh. No, hey, cheer up.

12:51.137 --> 12:54.300
I've been in trouble with Red before.
It's okay.

12:54.373 --> 12:57.206
No, it's not that.

12:57.276 --> 13:00.006
It's just seeing your dad
reminded me of my dad.

13:00.079 --> 13:03.537
Your dad's going away
on nice weekends and having fun...

13:03.616 --> 13:06.346
and my dad's out of work and sad.

13:06.418 --> 13:09.512
Plus your robe's not completely closed,
and that reminds me of him too.

13:11.857 --> 13:14.155
Okay. Okay, you know what?

13:15.895 --> 13:18.796
Let's turn that frown upside-down.

13:18.864 --> 13:22.493
That's right. Let's have
super-hot sex, baby.

13:25.371 --> 13:29.068
And by super-hot sex,
I mean...

13:29.141 --> 13:31.075
let's talk about your sad feelings.

13:36.048 --> 13:38.881
Okay, Jackie, I have some really
terrible news about Kelso...

13:38.951 --> 13:40.885
that will make us both laugh a lot.

13:40.953 --> 13:43.888
Yeah. I already know. Pam Macy
made this big announcement in gym.

13:55.301 --> 13:57.599
Jackie, this is where
we both laugh a lot.

14:00.039 --> 14:02.507
Actually, Fez,
I don't find it that funny.

14:02.575 --> 14:04.566
I kinda feel sad for him.

14:04.643 --> 14:07.441
But you hate him.
He totally screwed you over.

14:07.513 --> 14:10.311
Yeah, but he's grown up
a lot since then.

14:10.382 --> 14:12.543
And he's suffered,
and I'm over it by now.

14:13.619 --> 14:15.553
Poor Michael.

14:15.621 --> 14:18.112
Poor Michael?

14:18.190 --> 14:21.853
Well, I see I have wasted my time
talking to you. Good day, miss.

14:23.996 --> 14:27.227
- Wait, Fez.
- I said good day.

14:31.537 --> 14:34.563
What should we do
with all of this time alone?

14:34.640 --> 14:37.040
I'll get that.

14:37.109 --> 14:40.806
I ordered you a special surprise.

14:40.880 --> 14:43.371
Ta-da!

14:43.449 --> 14:47.476
Donna?
Donna is my surprise?

14:47.553 --> 14:52.616
Donna? What the... heck
are you doin' here, Donna?

14:54.093 --> 14:56.618
What the heck?

14:56.695 --> 14:59.528
Mrs. Forman, Eric is being a jerk,
and I wanted to talk to my mom.

14:59.598 --> 15:01.930
But since she's not here,
can I talk to you?

15:03.102 --> 15:05.093
<i>Eric's here too?</i>

15:05.170 --> 15:09.402
What on earth is goin' on?

15:09.475 --> 15:11.636
What the heck?

15:11.710 --> 15:15.202
- Red, what is going on here?
- Oh, I'm just as surprised as you.

15:15.281 --> 15:17.841
Oh, all right!

15:17.917 --> 15:21.978
- Eric and Donna are the noisy people next door.
- And you didn't tell me?

15:22.054 --> 15:24.614
Hello, Mommy?

15:24.690 --> 15:27.386
I'm sad!

15:33.766 --> 15:36.860
Donna, where have you...

15:36.936 --> 15:39.461
Your mother kicked me out.

15:39.538 --> 15:42.098
Oh, no.

15:51.583 --> 15:54.051
I said no.

15:59.759 --> 16:02.421
Guys, I gotta tell you somethin'.

16:03.596 --> 16:05.530
I'm omnipotent.

16:21.214 --> 16:25.344
Huh. This does taste
like Dr. Pepper.

16:26.986 --> 16:29.386
Told ya.

16:29.455 --> 16:31.616
Hey, you know what?
I think I might puke.

16:31.691 --> 16:33.921
Oh, no, no, no.
No, no.

16:33.993 --> 16:36.894
Honey, nobody gets sick
in Mr. And Mrs. Forman's room.

16:40.166 --> 16:42.828
You know, it is a lovely room.

16:42.902 --> 16:45.063
Red just saw the brochure
on the counter...

16:45.137 --> 16:47.628
and then he whisked me up
and he brought me here.

16:47.707 --> 16:50.608
It was very Humphrey Bogart.

16:50.676 --> 16:53.110
Eric did the same thing for me.

16:53.179 --> 16:55.773
- Sometimes he's really sweet.
- <i>Uh-huh.</i>

16:55.848 --> 16:57.782
Do you have a bucket?

16:57.850 --> 17:00.114
<i>Room service.</i>

17:00.186 --> 17:03.019
Honey. Honey, pretty girls
do not throw up.

17:09.428 --> 17:12.295
Oh, no, no. No, no.
I didn't order this.

17:12.365 --> 17:15.857
Oh, uh, it was ordered by
a Mr. Red Forman.

17:19.137 --> 17:22.198
Oh, my gosh.
This must have been his surprise.

17:22.275 --> 17:26.268
Oh! Flowers, champagne.

17:26.345 --> 17:28.313
Cashews.

17:29.715 --> 17:32.206
The most expensive nut,
you know.

17:33.552 --> 17:36.350
Oh, dear, sweet Red.
I have to go see him.

17:36.422 --> 17:38.788
- Are you feeling better?
- No.

17:38.858 --> 17:40.985
Okay, good. Nighty-night.

17:50.536 --> 17:54.438
Why is everything doing that?

17:59.512 --> 18:01.480
Hey, Michael.

18:01.547 --> 18:03.742
I heard what happened with Pam.

18:03.816 --> 18:07.980
And I want you to know, that according
to <i>Cosmopolitan</i> magazine, you're not a freak.

18:08.054 --> 18:09.646
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

18:09.722 --> 18:12.190
They say that, lots of times
when it happens to a guy...

18:12.258 --> 18:16.024
it's not that he can't, it's just that
he secretly doesn't want to.

18:16.095 --> 18:18.029
Okay, well, not to criticize...

18:18.097 --> 18:21.430
but <i>Cosmo's</i> never seen
Pam Macy naked.

18:21.500 --> 18:24.765
Michael, just think about it.
Do you like Pam?

18:24.837 --> 18:27.032
Well, I like parts of her.

18:28.574 --> 18:30.701
Well, maybe that's not enough.

18:30.776 --> 18:35.679
And maybe your body's mature enough
to realize that even if your brain isn't.

18:37.950 --> 18:41.511
Okay, well, you know,
if this is about maturity...

18:41.587 --> 18:43.714
then I want nothing
to do with it.

18:44.757 --> 18:48.887
Look, Michael,
don't worry, okay?

18:48.961 --> 18:51.156
When you find the girl
you're meant to be with...

18:51.230 --> 18:53.460
you'll be able to do
all the stuff you want.

18:53.532 --> 18:55.727
I promise.

18:55.801 --> 18:59.168
I hope you're right.
Thanks, Jackie.

19:06.312 --> 19:08.303
- I'm back.
- What?

19:11.984 --> 19:15.078
Nothin'.
Good hug!

19:22.061 --> 19:23.995
Out.

19:25.831 --> 19:28.664
But it's my room.

19:28.734 --> 19:30.668
Love ya, sweetie.

19:37.576 --> 19:40.010
Donna.

19:40.079 --> 19:42.877
Donna, are you there?

19:42.948 --> 19:46.884
<i>Donna, please open the door, please.</i>

19:52.792 --> 19:55.192
Great. I'm locked out
of both rooms.

19:56.295 --> 20:00.288
Well, at least I don't have any pants.

20:00.366 --> 20:04.097
I want you to open that door right now.
Our daughter's in there, and she's drunk.

20:05.171 --> 20:07.571
I really shouldn't be doing this.

20:07.640 --> 20:11.076
Okay. Then I'll just sue you...
until you're dead.

20:15.815 --> 20:19.182
- <i>You get off my daughter!</i>
- <i>Bob! What the hell?</i>

20:19.251 --> 20:21.185
<i>Red?</i>

20:21.253 --> 20:24.848
<i>Ooh! Kitty, what a pretty nightgown.</i>

20:24.924 --> 20:26.858
<i>Thank you, Midge.</i>

20:28.527 --> 20:31.018
<i>Could you hand it to me, please?</i>

20:36.902 --> 20:41.236
Look, I'm sorry about
getting all tipsy last night.

20:41.307 --> 20:43.571
Oh, no. Please,
I'm sorry.

20:43.642 --> 20:46.270
- The fight was all my fault.
- Fight? We had a fight?

20:48.848 --> 20:51.146
No.

20:51.217 --> 20:53.845
- What did you do?
- Nothing.

20:53.919 --> 20:58.288
Obviously you did something. I want to know
what it is in case I'm still mad about it.

20:59.525 --> 21:02.426
Well, okay.

21:02.495 --> 21:06.192
I had said that you were
the most beautiful girl in the world...

21:06.265 --> 21:09.257
and then you got all mad
and said, "Get bent."

21:11.337 --> 21:14.864
Not your finest hour,
but... I still love you.

21:16.175 --> 21:19.167
Wow. You must be really
upset about this.

21:19.245 --> 21:21.611
Um...

21:21.680 --> 21:24.046
kind of, yeah.

21:24.116 --> 21:26.949
Well, come on, Eric.
Let's turn that frown upside-down.

21:27.019 --> 21:29.647
That's right.
Let's have super-hot sex, baby.

21:31.557 --> 21:34.151
Oh, crap.

21:39.031 --> 21:41.522
Well, Genie Jackie,
I am in the mood...

21:41.600 --> 21:44.763
for some hot master-genie lovin'.

21:44.837 --> 21:46.930
Oh, I'm sorry,
Master Major Michael.

21:47.006 --> 21:49.998
But what we are going to have
is a warm master-genie friendship.

21:50.075 --> 21:52.839
In fact, I am the master now,
and you are the genie.

21:59.485 --> 22:01.953
Except you will not have
any genie powers.

22:02.021 --> 22:03.955
You will just do as I say.

22:04.023 --> 22:06.514
Now, do my math homework, Genie.

22:09.028 --> 22:10.962
<i>No!</i>
