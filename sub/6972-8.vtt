00:45.700 --> 00:49.400
The malfunction cut off power
to rural parts of Kroner County.

00:49.400 --> 00:53.400
Up next, the amazing story
of two giant pandas in love.

00:53.400 --> 00:56.800
But first, let's check in with
Holman Hardt and the weather.

00:56.800 --> 01:02.200
Well, still no rain in sight for the Kroner Hills region
as yet another winter storm passes south of us.

01:02.200 --> 01:06.700
I'll have all the numbers and my
five-day forecast right after this.

01:07.800 --> 01:11.300
Hey, baby, you're home early.

01:11.300 --> 01:14.900
Sheila, we got a really big problem here.

01:14.900 --> 01:17.200
What in the hell were you thinking?

01:17.200 --> 01:19.400
Happy Valentine's Day.

01:19.400 --> 01:25.800
We made a deal. We agreed to keep
the engagement secret until I said so.

01:25.800 --> 01:32.500
I know, but I just wanted everybody in town to
know why I've been so happy the last few months.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.300
Current temperature
in Kroner is 45 degrees.

01:37.400 --> 01:42.000
I know business has been slow but we can't stop
living just 'cause it hasn't rained in a spell.

01:42.000 --> 01:49.100
- Maybe we should just call off the engagement.
- Don't do this, not today. It'll rain soon. I can feel it.

01:49.100 --> 01:51.500
I-I just need time to think.

01:51.500 --> 01:57.100
Oh, look at that. And you
wonder why your ass is so big.

02:01.500 --> 02:05.400
"It'll rain soon. I can feel it."

03:13.000 --> 03:15.500
I'll be damned.

04:43.900 --> 04:46.700
SIX MONTHS LATER

05:22.100 --> 05:24.900
Don't look at me.
This was your idea.

05:24.900 --> 05:28.200
Agent Mulder, welcome to Kroner.
I'm Jim Gilmore, the mayor.

05:28.200 --> 05:30.300
- We spoke on the phone.
- Nice to meet you, sir.

05:30.300 --> 05:33.700
If I'd have known you was bringing the missus,
I would've arranged for fancier accommodations.

05:33.700 --> 05:39.400
I'm Agent Scully, Agent Mulder's partner.
I'm... sure the accommodations will be just fine.

05:39.400 --> 05:41.900
My apologies, ma'am.

05:42.200 --> 05:45.700
We appreciate your flying clear
out here to help solve our crisis.

05:45.700 --> 05:49.100
I'd hoped for a bigger welcome, but, well...

05:49.100 --> 05:53.000
Okay, Rhonda that's enough.
Go find your mama!

05:54.600 --> 06:02.000
Uh, sir you mentioned a crisis. Agent Mulder has been
a little... ah... vague as to the specifics of this crisis.

06:02.000 --> 06:07.000
It's all around us-- runted crops,
field fires, bankruptcies...

06:07.000 --> 06:12.200
This drought is destroying people's lives, and it's wrong
for a single man to prosper at the expense of others.

06:12.200 --> 06:14.600
A single man?

06:14.600 --> 06:19.700
Daryl Mootz. He's a local
fella charging people for rain.

06:20.900 --> 06:23.600
- You mean cloud seeding?
- The hell I do.

06:23.600 --> 06:29.300
I mean he shows up at a farm, does his
dog and pony act and the heavens weep.

06:30.300 --> 06:37.800
Well, sir, if this man Mootz could, in fact,
somehow produce rain then what's the crime?

06:37.800 --> 06:43.800
I believe Daryl's causing the drought...
so he can charge folks for the rain.

06:46.100 --> 06:49.600
And this is what you told
Agent Mulder when you spoke earlier?

06:49.600 --> 06:53.600
Yes, ma'am. He seemed real eager to help us.

07:13.500 --> 07:17.400
Come on, Scully. You act
like I intentionally misled you.

07:17.400 --> 07:23.100
Over the past 30 years this town has had
more tornadoes, heat waves and hailstorms
than any other town in the country.

07:23.100 --> 07:27.300
It's like... ground zero for extreme weather.

07:27.300 --> 07:30.200
A man... controlling... the weather.

07:30.200 --> 07:35.700
Well, if that's true-- if Daryl Mootz
is controlling the weather for profit.

07:35.700 --> 07:38.700
Then that is a crime and
that should be investigated.

07:38.700 --> 07:44.100
Mulder, I see the vacant buildings.
I see the signs. These people are scared.

07:44.100 --> 07:49.100
But there have always been droughts and natural
disasters and people are always looking for a scapegoat.

07:49.100 --> 07:53.200
Yeah, but how many
scapegoats lease office space?

08:06.600 --> 08:11.400
Agents Mulder and Scully with the FBI.
We're looking for Daryl Mootz.

08:12.200 --> 08:15.500
Yes, ma'am.
Appendix "C." That's right.

08:15.500 --> 08:20.300
I need a six-pack of beer, a carton of
Morley Lights, and a big old bowl of jellybeans.

08:20.300 --> 08:26.300
And can you pick out all the green ones 'cause
he don't like the green ones. You're welcome.

08:27.000 --> 08:31.300
- Now, what can I do for the FBI?
- We want to see the king.

08:31.300 --> 08:34.600
I'm sorry. Mr. Mootz is out of the
state till this afternoon on business.

08:34.600 --> 08:37.700
Well, when you say "on business"
you mean he's making it rain?

08:37.700 --> 08:42.500
Uh-huh. He's just across the state
line into Nebraska. Town of Wymore.

08:42.500 --> 08:47.400
If we could get a list of all the people who
have employed his services, it would be helpful.

08:47.400 --> 08:50.000
I don't understand. Does he...

08:50.000 --> 08:53.500
Don't y'all need a warrant or
a subpoena or something like that?

08:53.500 --> 08:56.800
We usually just say, "please."

08:57.000 --> 09:01.400
What are you investigating Daryl for?
He's a hero in this community.

09:01.400 --> 09:06.200
- So you actually believe that he makes it rain?
- I know it to be fact.

09:06.200 --> 09:10.900
He saved my daddy's farm.
How dare you people.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.300
See? Daryl's making that rain.

09:18.300 --> 09:22.000
Is it possible that he could
have just followed it up there?

09:25.400 --> 09:30.900
Here's your damn client list. You'll see.
Every one a satisfied customer.

09:30.900 --> 09:34.500
This, uh, TV station -- is that far from here?

09:43.400 --> 09:47.700
We were beginning to worry
that you wouldn't make it.

09:48.600 --> 09:55.000
Is this your first time in a TV studio? How exciting.
I couldn't be happier for the two of you.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.200
I'm not su...

10:04.000 --> 10:07.700
Holman, I'd like to introduce
you to the Gundersons.

10:07.700 --> 10:11.700
Congratulations! I hope you
have a truly romantic getaway.

10:11.700 --> 10:14.700
Aren't you glad you watch
Channel Five weather?

10:14.700 --> 10:18.300
We're Agents Mulder and Scully.
We're with the FBI.

10:18.300 --> 10:24.100
FBI? Oh, my goodness! I thought you were the
"Watch the Weather and Win" contest winners.

10:24.100 --> 10:27.100
See, we haven't had any rain in months and...

10:27.100 --> 10:33.600
- ...well, people tend to blame the messenger.
- Oh, there's the Gundersons. Over here!

10:39.600 --> 10:41.900
It's like looking in a mirror.

10:42.600 --> 10:48.000
When I first saw the pair of you I thought you
were rather smartly dressed for a farm couple.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.500
Make yourselves at home.

10:53.800 --> 10:59.500
Well, from what I've read about Kroner you've
had more than your fair share of unusual weather.

10:59.500 --> 11:05.100
Well, we certainly have. To you, Kroner
must seem small and simple but...

11:05.100 --> 11:11.100
...through the eyes of meteorology, low
pressure systems, storm fronts, tornado watches.

11:11.100 --> 11:15.300
Kroner is sophisticated, complex and...

11:15.300 --> 11:17.400
...well...

11:17.400 --> 11:19.200
...sexy.

11:19.200 --> 11:24.800
And... frankly I can't imagine a more
exciting place to be a meteorologist.

11:24.800 --> 11:28.300
Uh, Mr. Hardt, what can you
tell us about Daryl Mootz?

11:28.300 --> 11:33.100
The Mayor called you in, didn't he?
He thinks Daryl's causing the drought.

11:33.100 --> 11:36.000
- You don't think he's responsible.
- Of course not.

11:36.000 --> 11:41.500
A huge high-pressure system is the primary culprit.
There's no credible evidence to suggest that Daryl, ...

11:41.500 --> 11:45.200
...or any man can be held
accountable for our predicament.

11:45.200 --> 11:49.600
- Thank you. Can we go now?
- No, no, um... What about the rain?

11:49.600 --> 11:54.200
Well, that's a more clouded
issue if you'll excuse my pun.

11:54.200 --> 11:58.700
I have a list of over 40 names here, ...

11:58.700 --> 12:04.400
...people in four different counties, who claim
that Daryl Mootz has made it rain for them.

12:04.600 --> 12:09.300
I went to high school with Daryl.
Different social circles and...

12:09.300 --> 12:14.200
...frankly, he's about the last man I
would give credit to for anything...

12:14.200 --> 12:17.500
I hear a big "but" coming.

12:17.700 --> 12:24.700
Daryl appears to be the real deal.
I can't explain it, but...

12:24.700 --> 12:29.200
...where he wanders, showers follow.

12:41.400 --> 12:45.500
Look at the desperation on these people's
faces, Mulder. They're ready to believe anything.

12:45.500 --> 12:49.600
According to his schedule the
King should have been here by now.

12:49.600 --> 12:53.800
Here he comes!
Here he comes! He's here!

13:22.000 --> 13:28.200
- Oh, isn't that sweet? That's sweet.
- Man! What could we use around here, a little rain?

13:28.800 --> 13:34.300
Oh, look at this! Ah!
Take these, will you, somebody?

13:46.200 --> 13:53.000
That is the wrong damn boot, now, isn't it, hon?
Be a good girl, and go on and get me the red snakeskin.

13:53.400 --> 13:58.400
Well, looky here.
The FBI.

13:58.400 --> 14:03.200
We just came to see the show.
I guess, uh, we're a little early.

14:03.200 --> 14:06.400
Oh, ye of little faith.

14:06.600 --> 14:10.800
That truck out there of mine is a
whole lot faster than my rain clouds.

14:10.800 --> 14:12.800
Excuse me.

14:14.800 --> 14:16.400
Thank you.

14:16.400 --> 14:22.500
- How do you explain your unique ability?
- I don't. It's complicated.

14:22.500 --> 14:25.500
Try me. I watch the Weather Channel.

14:27.500 --> 14:37.000
If you're wondering did I ask for this gift no, sir,
I did not, no more than I asked to lose this here limb.

14:37.200 --> 14:46.500
But I should've expected it and I'll tell you why.
Because I come from a long line of healing people.

14:46.900 --> 14:49.800
I'm a spiritual man, in touch...

14:50.600 --> 14:56.700
...with the really real.
The, the unseen real.

15:03.700 --> 15:08.300
And I... am one 64th Cherokee...

15:08.300 --> 15:13.200
...and I can summon up my
ancestors to bring water...

15:13.200 --> 15:15.600
...to this thirsty land.

15:18.100 --> 15:19.600
Yeah!

15:31.200 --> 15:35.600
- Mulder, what are we doing here?
- Well, this is not without historical precedent.

15:35.600 --> 15:40.600
The Old West was full of traveling men
who claimed to be rainmakers.
The Pueblo Indians even had a rain dance.

15:40.600 --> 15:43.200
Mulder, that is not a rain dance.

15:43.200 --> 15:47.500
My Irish Aunt Olive has more
Cherokee in her than Daryl Mootz.

15:49.000 --> 15:53.700
I mean, look at him, Mulder. Does that look
like a man who can control the weather?

16:20.100 --> 16:26.600
- Are we still going to the reunion together on Friday?
- Absolutely. Social event of the decade.

16:26.600 --> 16:30.300
Hard to believe it's been 20 years
since we finished high school.

16:30.300 --> 16:36.400
Where did the time go? What were
those FBI people looking for?

16:36.400 --> 16:41.500
Oh, they were asking questions
about Daryl. About making it rain.

16:41.500 --> 16:46.700
I wish they'd just go back to wherever
they came from and leave him alone.

16:46.700 --> 16:50.400
You don't still love him, do you?

16:51.400 --> 16:55.900
I can't believe you still care about
him after the way he treated you.

16:55.900 --> 17:00.300
- I know.
- He never loved you, Sheila.

17:00.300 --> 17:04.800
All he cared about was your money, and
as soon as he got some of his own...

17:04.800 --> 17:09.700
- ...he just--
- He left. I know. But I think he used to love me.

17:10.400 --> 17:14.900
There are other men
who will love you more.

17:14.900 --> 17:21.500
FBI-- my Lord. I don't think I'll be able
to sleep knowing they're poking round.

17:55.400 --> 17:57.600
"26 TORNADOS DAILY."

18:32.900 --> 18:37.600
Ma'am, unless you want to get covered in
hamburger, I reckon you should step outside.

18:46.500 --> 18:50.200
Oh, miss, we moved your
boyfriend's things into your room.

18:50.200 --> 18:53.100
He's my partner, and
we prefer separate rooms.

18:53.100 --> 18:55.500
Oh, old-fashioned are you, huh?

18:55.500 --> 19:00.100
Well, we're booked solid with the high
school reunion. You can take it or leave it.

19:00.300 --> 19:04.600
We can just butterfly it.
I've got my kit over in the car.

19:04.600 --> 19:10.700
Scully, I don't think it's a coincidence
that a cow gets hurled at me just as
we're down here investigating the weather.

19:10.700 --> 19:15.900
- Mulder, did they check you for head trauma?
- I'm telling you, that cow had my name on it.

19:20.400 --> 19:24.400
Agent Mulder, are you all right?
I feel terrible.

19:24.400 --> 19:28.400
- If there's anything I can do, please don't hesitate.
- Perhaps there is.

19:28.400 --> 19:34.400
Mr. Hardt, would you please reassure Agent Mulder that
this cow incident was, in fact, a natural phenomenon?

19:34.400 --> 19:39.700
With pleasure. Uh, it's my belief that a
mini-twister picked that poor creature up, ...

19:39.700 --> 19:47.700
...lifted it about 12,000 feet where the air cooled and,
uh... I'm just grateful you weren't hurt any worse.

19:47.900 --> 19:49.800
Excuse me.

19:52.800 --> 19:57.200
- You shouldn't be here.
- Holman, don't make this any harder.

19:58.500 --> 20:01.800
It's my fault.
I did it.

20:04.600 --> 20:09.200
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean for this to happen.

20:09.200 --> 20:12.800
It's not something that I can control.

20:12.800 --> 20:18.900
- Are you saying that you're somehow responsible for the...
- I murdered that poor cow!

20:19.900 --> 20:25.300
Uh... Holman just explained to us that, uh,
that a mini-twister is what caused the accident.

20:25.300 --> 20:30.100
He's just being sweet, covering
for me. He knows the truth.

20:31.100 --> 20:35.900
This isn't the first time
something like this has happened.

20:35.900 --> 20:41.900
The night of my senior prom a
tornado demolished our high school...

20:42.500 --> 20:48.200
And then... On my wedding day,
a day I'd always dreamed about, ...

20:48.500 --> 20:53.400
...the ceremony was outdoors on
the Fourth of July weekend.

20:53.900 --> 20:57.200
It snowed six inches.

20:57.600 --> 21:03.000
Then three years later my husband ran
off with some gal from the phone company...

21:03.000 --> 21:09.300
...and on the day that our divorce was
finalized I stepped out of the courthouse and...

21:09.300 --> 21:15.400
...you know how you-you-you can
see shapes in those big fluffy clouds?

21:15.400 --> 21:23.400
Well... I swear that every cloud in that
big blue sky was a face laughing at me...

21:25.600 --> 21:33.800
And that was about ten years ago and that
was the last time it happened until last night.

21:35.500 --> 21:42.100
- What's your connection to Daryl Mootz?
- Well... We used to be engaged.

21:42.200 --> 21:44.500
You two were engaged?

21:44.500 --> 21:48.400
Yeah, about six months ago and, um...

21:48.400 --> 21:55.900
we had a fight and he took a drive, and...
and a... and a freak hailstorm cost him his leg.

21:56.600 --> 22:00.600
And ever since then,
the rain's been following him.

22:05.600 --> 22:08.100
- Am I under arrest?
- No.

22:08.100 --> 22:12.000
I can tell you without a doubt that you're
not responsible for any of that weather.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.700
Oh... But...

22:13.700 --> 22:17.300
Agent Scully and I specialize in
these types of cases and-and-and...

22:17.300 --> 22:22.100
...although you may have had some
bad luck you didn't cause any of it.

22:22.100 --> 22:27.100
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm... I'm sure. Scully, you have any doubts?

22:27.100 --> 22:29.600
- No. No doubts.
- You see?

22:32.600 --> 22:35.500
I really want to believe you.

22:37.900 --> 22:40.700
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

22:46.600 --> 22:50.400
- That hailstorm didn't cause Daryl's car crash.
- What are you talking about?

22:50.400 --> 22:54.000
The weather was bad, but Daryl
was drunk and driving too fast.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.500
Drunk? I... never heard that.

22:56.500 --> 23:01.400
We all felt that Daryl losing
his leg was punishment enough.

23:11.700 --> 23:18.100
People don't realize how hard a work this is.
I mean, sure, it looks like I'm just sitting here, but...

23:18.300 --> 23:21.000
My powers of concentration...

23:21.000 --> 23:24.700
Oh, yeah, oh, right there, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, oh, you...

23:24.700 --> 23:26.800
You're worth every penny.

23:27.600 --> 23:30.500
- Now, what was I saying?
- "Powers of concentration."

23:30.500 --> 23:34.900
Yeah, right. I... m-my brain's functioning on
something like, I don't know, 14 different...

23:34.900 --> 23:40.900
...levels taking in a whole bunch of variables
like wind velocity and-and humidity and...

23:40.900 --> 23:44.800
- Daryl... Do you hear that?
- Hear what?

23:44.800 --> 23:47.400
The rain stopped.

24:08.300 --> 24:10.300
Next flight out is 10:00 tomorrow morning.

24:10.300 --> 24:18.200
Look at this, Scully September 20, 1991,
it rained rose petals for nearly an hour.

24:18.800 --> 24:24.100
Mulder, we're going home. The rain stopped this
afternoon. Daryl Mootz is being sued by about 50 people.

24:24.100 --> 24:28.700
There's no case... And you told Sheila yourself
that she wasn't controlling the weather.

24:28.700 --> 24:31.900
She's not.
Neither is Daryl.

24:31.900 --> 24:36.700
Check this out, on the same
day that it rained rose petals.

24:37.700 --> 24:44.000
"Irene Hardt, beloved wife and devoted
mother passed away yesterday afternoon...

24:44.700 --> 24:47.700
She's survived by one son, Holman Hardt."

24:47.700 --> 24:50.800
- Oh, so, now you're saying that Holman Hardt...
- Holman Hardt is manufacturing the weather.

24:50.800 --> 24:53.900
Did you see how relieved he was
when he learned that Daryl was drunk?

24:53.900 --> 24:56.400
I've been doing some checking.

24:56.400 --> 25:01.300
Holman Hardt has been hospitalized
five times with nervous exhaustion, ...

25:01.300 --> 25:04.900
...each time coinciding with a
major meteorological event.

25:04.900 --> 25:09.000
Mulder, it is still a huge leap to say
that he's manufacturing the weather.

25:09.000 --> 25:15.100
Most people will admit that the weather plays
a significant role in the way they feel, right?
There's even that disorder.

25:15.100 --> 25:17.900
- SAD: seasonal affective disorder.
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

25:17.900 --> 25:20.300
Well, who's to say that it
doesn't work the other way around, ...

25:20.300 --> 25:26.500
...that the way someone feels can affect
the weather, that the weather is somehow
an expression of Holman Hardt's feelings...

25:26.500 --> 25:31.400
...or-or-or better still, the feelings
that he's not expressing?

25:31.700 --> 25:35.700
I've tried to say this a thousand times...

25:35.700 --> 25:42.400
Tried to express the... fire that burns inside this...

25:42.400 --> 25:45.700
...humble exterior.

25:46.700 --> 25:51.500
Sheila, you're the reason I remained
in this town all these years.

25:51.900 --> 25:55.200
I wake up each day knowing...

26:02.900 --> 26:06.000
- Hello?
- Holman, it's me. Working late?

26:06.000 --> 26:09.900
Sh-sheila, hi. Yeah, um...

26:11.100 --> 26:16.200
I was just thinking about you. I'm looking
forward to the reunion tomorrow night.

26:16.200 --> 26:17.600
Me, too.

26:17.600 --> 26:23.600
- You sound in a good mood.
- Well, I am, Holman, and it's all because of you.

26:23.600 --> 26:29.300
I wanted to let you know that I've been thinking
about what you said about Daryl yesterday...

26:29.300 --> 26:31.600
...and I realized that you were right.

26:31.600 --> 26:35.400
- I was?
- Yes, you were, and I am so over him.

26:35.400 --> 26:41.100
"Daryl who?" That's what I say. I realized that
I've been chasing the wrong kind of guy.

26:41.100 --> 26:45.800
I need someone who I can talk to.
I need someone who I can feel safe with.

26:45.800 --> 26:49.200
I can't tell you what that means to me.

26:49.200 --> 26:55.000
Holman, I want to ask you something and I hope
that we can keep it our secret for the time being.

26:55.000 --> 26:58.200
Of course, Sheila, anything.

26:58.200 --> 27:01.800
Well, what do you think of Agent Mulder?

27:16.200 --> 27:18.300
Hey, Holman.

27:23.300 --> 27:26.300
- Agent Mulder.
- I've come to say good-bye, Holman.

27:26.300 --> 27:28.700
- You're leaving.
- Yeah.

27:28.900 --> 27:32.000
But I want you to get some
help before you kill somebody.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.400
- Help? What are you talking about?
- You know what I'm talking about.

27:34.400 --> 27:37.400
You're not just a weatherman,
you're THE weatherman.

27:37.400 --> 27:40.100
You're the person who's
been affecting the weather.

27:40.100 --> 27:44.700
Agent Mulder, if I could control the
weather don't you think I would make it rain?

27:44.700 --> 27:47.000
- That I would end this drought?
- I don't think it works that way.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.800
I don't think you do it on purpose.
I just think you bottle up your emotions, ...

27:49.800 --> 27:56.300
...anger, grief, or love or whatever, and then, as a
response, it rains or hails or there's a flying cow.

27:56.700 --> 27:58.500
That poor animal.

27:58.500 --> 28:01.200
And whatever it is, you got to let it out.

28:02.300 --> 28:04.800
I can't.

28:07.300 --> 28:09.500
Yeah, you can.

28:13.000 --> 28:16.500
It's Sheila, isn't it?
You love her.

28:18.800 --> 28:21.400
You've always loved her.

28:22.000 --> 28:28.700
That, uh, tornado at the high
school... that was you, wasn't it?

28:33.300 --> 28:37.100
The night of our senior prom, I, uh...

28:38.300 --> 28:43.000
...accidentally stumbled
upon her and her boyfriend...

28:44.900 --> 28:50.800
...in flagrante delicto.
And the next thing you know...

28:53.100 --> 28:56.800
And you've never told her the way you feel?

28:57.400 --> 29:01.700
How can a frog tell a swan that he loves her?

29:02.000 --> 29:06.000
Well, you better tell her or
you're going to kill somebody.

29:06.300 --> 29:08.900
- W-well, you got to help me.
- I got a plane to catch.

29:08.900 --> 29:14.000
- You can't go. If you don't help me, who will?
- I am meeting my partner at the airport.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.700
Excuse me. Hold on.

29:17.400 --> 29:19.700
- Mulder.
- Mulder, it's me.

29:19.700 --> 29:24.200
- I'm on my way.
- I'm not so sure. Have you looked outside lately?

29:24.200 --> 29:26.000
It's pea soup.

29:26.000 --> 29:30.000
- Our plane can't take off until after this fog lifts.
- Fog?

29:30.000 --> 29:32.200
Holman!

29:32.400 --> 29:37.500
- Holman?
- Yeah... he wants advice. Dating advice.

29:37.500 --> 29:39.600
Dating advice?
From whom?

29:39.600 --> 29:41.600
Yours truly.

29:44.300 --> 29:48.100
Hello? Hey, Scully.
Scully, you there?

29:48.100 --> 29:50.900
I heard you.

29:50.900 --> 29:55.600
- Mulder, when was the last time you went on a date?
- I will talk to you later.

29:59.800 --> 30:02.400
The blind leading the blind.

30:10.900 --> 30:13.000
This red number?

30:17.200 --> 30:21.600
Daryl, you're like one of those tragic rock stars.

30:21.600 --> 30:25.100
You know, like, like Jim Morrison or Kurt Cobain.

30:25.100 --> 30:29.000
You just shine too bright for too short a time.

30:29.700 --> 30:32.700
We'll tell our kids all about it.

30:32.700 --> 30:40.400
Kids. Can't afford kids. If I don't come up
with a lot of cash pronto I am in deep doo-doo.

30:40.700 --> 30:44.800
Dairy Queen will take me back.
I get almost six dollars an hour.

30:44.800 --> 30:51.000
- I'm thinking. There's got to be somebody...
- We'll get the money, baby.

30:53.700 --> 30:57.200
- Sheila.
- What about her?

30:59.800 --> 31:01.900
Cindy...

31:02.800 --> 31:08.900
You have been real sweet and all but
I think we can use some time apart.

31:08.900 --> 31:12.600
What? Are you breaking up with me?

31:12.600 --> 31:14.600
Nothing personal.

31:19.900 --> 31:23.000
I've been envious of men
like you my whole life.

31:23.000 --> 31:29.800
Based on your physical bearing,
I'd assumed you were... More experienced.

31:29.800 --> 31:35.600
I mean... You spend every day with
Agent Scully a beautiful, enchanting woman.

31:36.800 --> 31:39.400
And you two never, uh...?

31:41.900 --> 31:49.200
I... confess I find that shocking. I... I've
seen how you two gaze at one another.

31:51.400 --> 31:54.400
This is about you, Holman.
I'm here to help you.

31:54.400 --> 31:57.800
I'm perfectly happy with my
friendship with Agent Scully.

32:04.300 --> 32:10.000
So according to your theory I walk in there,
tell her I love her and the drought will end?

32:11.700 --> 32:14.600
Just tell her how you feel.

32:15.600 --> 32:20.300
And Holman.
I do not gaze at Scully.

32:23.400 --> 32:25.200
- Hey.
- Hey.

32:25.200 --> 32:29.500
I can't find my notes for
my... presentation. Here they are.

32:29.700 --> 32:32.400
- You got a minute?
- For you, always.

32:32.400 --> 32:35.100
Are you excited about the
high school reunion tonight?

32:35.100 --> 32:37.500
Of course. Uh...

32:38.800 --> 32:42.900
- You're busy. We can talk later.
- Oh, what is it?

32:51.200 --> 32:52.800
I...

32:55.600 --> 32:58.500
I love you.

32:58.500 --> 33:01.000
I love you, too.

33:03.700 --> 33:06.700
Holman. What's wrong?

33:12.600 --> 33:16.400
Is that rain?
Oh, my gosh, it is!

33:17.400 --> 33:19.300
It's raining!

33:24.100 --> 33:25.500
Well?

33:27.900 --> 33:33.000
Good afternoon, Agent Mulder.
See you tonight, Holman.

33:33.300 --> 33:35.600
Oh, you did it.

33:37.500 --> 33:39.900
No, you did it.

33:40.500 --> 33:44.300
- What are you talking about?
- She said that she loves me...

33:44.600 --> 33:49.300
...but that she's in love with you.

33:54.600 --> 33:58.000
- What do you mean there's somebody else?
- Daryl, this isn't the place.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.700
- Just tell me who it is.
- Let me go!

34:00.700 --> 34:01.900
Hey!

34:01.900 --> 34:04.900
Hey, Daryl.
Cut it out, man.

34:06.900 --> 34:08.699
Him?

34:09.699 --> 34:13.699
This is the guy?!
Oh, what's he got that I ain't got?

34:13.699 --> 34:18.699
A job. A way with words.
Intelligence. Good looks.

34:18.699 --> 34:22.600
Good looking?
I'll show you good looking.

34:22.600 --> 34:24.699
Daryl!
No, not his face!

34:24.699 --> 34:28.000
- Daryl.
- Don't you hit him in the face!

34:28.500 --> 34:32.300
Oh, good. Picking on a cripple.
You'll hear from my lawyer.

34:33.600 --> 34:35.800
- You deserve a big reward.
- No...

34:49.400 --> 34:55.500
Mulder, the fog has lifted and if
you're ready... the plane is waiting.

34:55.500 --> 34:59.500
Scully, do you know anything
about, um... weather radar?

34:59.500 --> 35:02.300
A bit. Why?

35:02.300 --> 35:04.800
What does red mean?

35:05.600 --> 35:08.400
Thunderstorms, I think.

35:08.800 --> 35:12.100
Looks like we're not going
to be able to catch our plane.

35:58.500 --> 36:01.200
Seven inches in the past six hours.

36:01.200 --> 36:05.500
The national weather service has issued
a flash flood warning for the county.

36:06.100 --> 36:10.300
- Mulder, are you sure he's here?
- If she's here, he'll be here.

36:29.000 --> 36:32.900
- Come on, Holman, now make it stop.
- This is your fault, not mine.

36:32.900 --> 36:36.600
- My fault?
- You were kissing her.

36:39.800 --> 36:43.600
Oh, look who's here's some
of my favorite people.

36:43.600 --> 36:46.900
Old friend, ...and new ones.

36:47.500 --> 36:53.200
- You look very lovely tonight, Sheila.
- Thank you. You look handsome. Both of you.

36:54.100 --> 36:58.800
Oh, I love this song.
Agent Mulder, care to dance?

36:58.800 --> 37:03.300
Holman was just telling us that,
uh, that he wanted to dance.

37:05.200 --> 37:09.100
- Yes, he was.
- I would be honored.

37:09.100 --> 37:10.700
Okay.

37:13.300 --> 37:15.200
Tell her, Holman.

37:17.800 --> 37:23.500
- What was that Agent Mulder said? Tell me what?
- Oh, no big deal.

37:23.700 --> 37:26.800
We tell each other everything, don't we?

37:28.200 --> 37:30.400
Well...

37:36.100 --> 37:39.700
When I stopped by your office this afternoon...

37:41.200 --> 37:44.800
- When I said that...
- When you said you loved me.

37:44.800 --> 37:48.000
What I meant to say...

37:49.200 --> 37:53.200
What I wanted you to understand...

37:55.200 --> 37:59.400
Is that I'm in love with you.

37:59.400 --> 38:02.800
That I've loved you since high school.

38:12.500 --> 38:15.600
I'll build the ark, you gather the animals.

38:15.600 --> 38:17.800
I was kidding.

38:24.300 --> 38:26.600
Sheila...

38:28.000 --> 38:33.100
My partner has a theory and even though
I don't share his belief I feel...

38:33.100 --> 38:39.800
...that, given the circumstances you should hear
his theory because it involves you and Holman.

38:41.100 --> 38:47.500
Agent Mulder believes that the drought,
this storm, these bizarre...

38:47.500 --> 38:52.100
...set of weather conditions that have
plagued you over the years are...

38:52.100 --> 38:54.900
...are caused by Holman.

38:56.200 --> 38:59.100
Specifically, that...

38:59.100 --> 39:05.800
...that his emotions are somehow
manifesting themselves in the weather...

39:05.800 --> 39:10.200
...and Agent Mulder believes
that-that Holman is...

39:10.200 --> 39:16.500
...unwittingly destroying this town
because of his unspoken love for you.

39:16.500 --> 39:18.600
You love him, don't you?

39:18.600 --> 39:20.400
What?

39:20.500 --> 39:26.200
You're jealous because Agent Mulder and I have a
special connection and you're trying to divert me to Holman.

39:26.200 --> 39:27.900
What?

39:30.300 --> 39:33.600
It is good to be the king!

39:35.600 --> 39:38.600
It is good to be the king!

39:41.300 --> 39:43.400
Where's Sheila?

39:43.400 --> 39:45.500
Where's your leg?

39:45.500 --> 39:50.500
Cindy took it. Said I'd
have to crawl back to her.

39:50.500 --> 39:52.400
Now, where's Sheila?

39:52.400 --> 39:55.100
Not even a kiss?

39:56.700 --> 40:00.700
Trust me, the man knows how to kiss.

40:02.800 --> 40:05.900
I just never thought of
Holman that way, you know.

40:05.900 --> 40:10.600
He's my closest friend.
And to not even suspect...

40:11.500 --> 40:17.200
Well, it seems to me that the best
relationships, the ones that last, ...

40:17.200 --> 40:20.500
...are frequently the ones that
are rooted in friendship.

40:20.500 --> 40:27.700
You know, one day you look at the person and you
see something more than you did the night before.

40:27.700 --> 40:31.200
Like a switch has been flicked somewhere.

40:31.200 --> 40:34.900
And the person who was just a friend is...

40:34.900 --> 40:39.700
...suddenly the only person you
can ever imagine yourself with.

40:45.300 --> 40:49.000
The storm drains are filling up.
Let's get out of here.

40:55.200 --> 40:58.400
I'll teach you to mess with my woman.

41:05.900 --> 41:09.300
If I had two legs I'd kick your...

41:20.800 --> 41:22.400
I called the police.

41:22.400 --> 41:26.500
You might want to take a look at
the king, make sure he's all right.

41:26.800 --> 41:29.100
Whatever happened to Sheila?

41:47.400 --> 41:52.600
Is it true?
That you make the weather?

41:53.800 --> 41:56.600
Because of me?

41:57.800 --> 42:02.800
- The tornado in high school, snow at my wedding?
- I'm so sorry.

42:02.800 --> 42:06.500
- Daryl's rain?
- Can't explain the logic of it. Yes.

42:06.500 --> 42:15.500
- Some strange manifestation of guilt.
- Even this rain? Because you love me?

42:15.500 --> 42:20.400
Because... I love you.

42:24.100 --> 42:28.400
That is the most romantic thing I've ever heard.

43:02.700 --> 43:08.500
- I'm sorry, baby.
- Me, too. I brought you a leg.

Oh...!

43:13.300 --> 43:16.700
Why you so good to me, honey?

43:37.000 --> 43:41.800

43:45.900 --> 43:48.200
Well, how'd it go?

43:48.200 --> 43:51.500
You should try it sometime.

43:51.900 --> 43:53.700

43:59.900 --> 44:03.400

44:03.400 --> 44:08.700

44:16.700 --> 44:22.100

44:22.100 --> 44:24.600
Yes, you are.
