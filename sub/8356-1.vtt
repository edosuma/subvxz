02:45.598 --> 02:48.499
- Is that for us?
- No, it's for you.

02:48.601 --> 02:50.535
- What is that?
- A mantrap.

02:50.670 --> 02:53.571
They used to use it
for catching poachers.

02:53.673 --> 02:55.368
Hello, Amy.

02:55.475 --> 02:57.841
- Hello, Charlie.
- Where do we put it, Mr. Sumner?

02:57.944 --> 03:01.004
- Oh. Here in the back.
- Oh, it's heavy, Mr. Sumner.

03:01.114 --> 03:03.981
I'm surprised
you still remember me.

03:04.083 --> 03:05.983
Where do we put it, Amy?

03:06.085 --> 03:08.986
Anywhere you want.
It's your birthday present.

03:09.088 --> 03:11.648
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

03:11.758 --> 03:14.192
- Don't scratch it.
- Why are you surprised?

03:14.294 --> 03:17.354
- How long has it been, Charlie?
- Three summer holidays in six years.

03:19.432 --> 03:22.367
David, this is an old
friend of mine, Charlie Venner.

03:22.468 --> 03:24.368
My husband, David Sumner.

03:24.470 --> 03:26.370
- Mr. Venner.
- Please call me Charlie.

03:26.472 --> 03:28.736
You work around here?

03:28.841 --> 03:30.604
Sometimes.

03:30.710 --> 03:33.110
- Will you give me a hand, please?
- Yeah.

03:33.213 --> 03:35.613
- David's a mathematician.
- What are you going to catch?

03:35.715 --> 03:38.343
- Peace and quiet.
- Oh, an arithmetic teacher.

03:38.451 --> 03:39.850
- Well, uh--
- No.

03:39.953 --> 03:41.853
He's writing a book...

03:41.955 --> 03:44.685
on the computer analysis
of the celestial--

03:44.791 --> 03:47.521
Good try. Here, why don't you
put this in the trunk, Amy.

03:47.660 --> 03:49.560
Let me.

03:55.034 --> 03:58.333
Maybe, um, Charlie could
help us with the garage, David.

03:58.438 --> 04:01.032
Yeah, that's a good idea.
This fellow Norman, uh--

04:01.140 --> 04:03.370
- Scutt.
- Yes.

04:03.476 --> 04:08.038
- He's, uh, taking forever.
- Me and Bobby'll do it for you, Mr. Sumner.

04:08.147 --> 04:11.446
Me and my cousin Bertie will be out
tomorrow. We'll get it up for you.

04:11.551 --> 04:13.451
Yes? How much?

04:13.553 --> 04:17.045
- Oh, reasonable.
- Okay, thank you.

04:17.156 --> 04:19.420
- We're at--
- Back at Trencher's farm.

04:19.524 --> 04:21.390
We'll be there, sir.

04:22.695 --> 04:24.595
Good. Good.

04:30.903 --> 04:32.803
Where are you going?

04:32.905 --> 04:34.497
David?

04:34.607 --> 04:37.269
- Where are you going?
- Cigarettes.

04:38.878 --> 04:41.574
Okay.

04:45.285 --> 04:48.686
Uh, a couple of packs of
any American cigarettes, please.

04:48.788 --> 04:51.188
- Time, gentlemen, please.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.782
Finish your drinkin', gentlemen.
Let me have your glasses.

05:09.175 --> 05:11.075
Henry Niles.

05:11.177 --> 05:13.645
I thought he was to be put away.

05:13.746 --> 05:17.409
Oh, we can take care
of our own here. Usually do.

05:24.791 --> 05:27.021
Remember when
I took care of you, Amy?

05:33.933 --> 05:36.697
But you didn't.
Remember?

05:38.971 --> 05:42.236
There was once a time,
Mrs. Sumner...

05:42.342 --> 05:45.800
when you were ready
to beg me for it.

05:45.912 --> 05:47.812
Take your hands off me.

06:10.002 --> 06:12.903
Come on, gentlemen. Drink up.
Let me have your glasses, please.

06:13.005 --> 06:14.973
Bloody early, Harry.

06:20.480 --> 06:22.243
Harry...

06:23.383 --> 06:26.250
I think I should have another pint.

06:34.494 --> 06:36.394
Sorry about my uncle, Harry.

06:36.496 --> 06:38.396
I think he's a bit taken with drink.

06:38.498 --> 06:40.398
Oh.

06:40.500 --> 06:43.731
I do beg your pardon,
Mr. Harry Ware.

06:43.836 --> 06:48.034
- I'll pay for the American gentlemen's cigarettes.
- Oh, no, that's okay, I--

06:48.141 --> 06:50.769
That's all right.
I got it, sir.

06:50.877 --> 06:52.777
Garage coming along?

06:52.879 --> 06:54.779
Norman fixing it up all right?

06:54.881 --> 06:56.644
Yeah.

06:59.886 --> 07:01.717
And I'll pay for the glass.

07:01.821 --> 07:05.518
And I'll even pay for the little bit of
plaster to put on your bleedin' finger.

07:05.625 --> 07:09.857
But I do think I should have
another pint to take me home.

07:09.996 --> 07:12.362
The bar's closed, Tom.

07:12.465 --> 07:14.365
- Come on, Tom.
- Oh.

07:14.467 --> 07:17.061
It is, is it?

07:17.170 --> 07:19.468
We'll see about that.!

07:19.572 --> 07:22.973
- Take it easy, old man!
- Old man, you say?

07:44.063 --> 07:45.963
All right, Tom.

07:46.065 --> 07:47.862
You've had your fun.

07:47.967 --> 07:49.867
Pay the man and leave.

07:51.103 --> 07:53.003
Ah.

07:56.375 --> 07:59.139
Oh.

07:59.245 --> 08:02.408
I do beg your pardon,
Mr. Magistrate.

08:06.686 --> 08:09.416
But what I am, I am.

08:09.522 --> 08:11.422
What's the damage, Harry?

08:11.524 --> 08:13.151
Call it a quid, Tom.

08:13.259 --> 08:15.693
Let's call it, uh...

08:15.795 --> 08:17.695
30 bob.

08:19.465 --> 08:22.366
Will that do then, eh, Major?

08:22.468 --> 08:24.436
Go home, Tom, will you...

08:24.537 --> 08:27.028
or you'll be up before me
on a fresh charge.

08:34.246 --> 08:36.477
Come on, lads.
Work to be done.

08:37.683 --> 08:40.549
- See you tonight, Harry.
- All right, Tom.

08:47.627 --> 08:49.527
I showed him, eh, lads?

08:54.333 --> 08:56.233
Uh, they're paid for, sir.

08:59.138 --> 09:01.003
They are now.

09:24.463 --> 09:27.591
- Stupid cow!
- Get off.

09:27.700 --> 09:30.362
What was that about?

09:35.308 --> 09:38.209
Who was that big guy
with the beard?

09:38.311 --> 09:40.871
Why?

09:40.980 --> 09:43.881
Is he any relation
to your friend Charlie?

09:43.983 --> 09:45.883
Yes.

10:03.736 --> 10:07.069
How well do you know
this fellow Venner?

10:08.474 --> 10:10.374
Stop teasing.

10:10.476 --> 10:12.842
- Did you ever go out with him?
-Stop.

10:12.945 --> 10:15.345
- Hmm?
- Leave me alone! Stop it!

10:15.448 --> 10:17.848
Stop.

10:17.950 --> 10:19.850
- Tell me.
- I'll stop the car.

10:19.952 --> 10:22.147
I just want to know.
Tell me.

10:23.055 --> 10:24.989
Stop. I'm telling you.

10:25.091 --> 10:27.651
- You asked for it.
- Okay.

10:27.793 --> 10:29.693
All right, drive the car-- Ooh!

10:29.795 --> 10:31.592
Ooh! Ooh!

10:31.697 --> 10:33.562
You asked for it!
Chicken!

10:33.666 --> 10:36.464
- You're nuts!
- You're terrible! You're wicked!

10:36.569 --> 10:40.300
Oh, by the way--

10:40.406 --> 10:42.966
- Yeah?
- Venner did try to get fresh once.

10:43.075 --> 10:45.635
Yeah? So?

10:45.745 --> 10:49.237
Nothing happened.!
# Ba-bum #

10:49.348 --> 10:52.681
# Ba-ba-bah-bum
Ba-ba, ba-bum #

11:19.512 --> 11:21.412
Hi.

11:23.816 --> 11:25.716
You'll have some help tomorrow.

11:25.818 --> 11:31.051
Charles Venner and his cousin
are coming to help finish the garage.

11:31.157 --> 11:33.717
We'll have the garage finished
before Chris gets the rats out.

11:34.894 --> 11:36.657
- Hello, miss.
- Chris?

11:36.796 --> 11:38.423
Yeah, Chris.

11:39.965 --> 11:43.457
Oh,yes. Mr. Cawsey.
The rat man.

11:43.569 --> 11:45.469
- Want help with this, sir?
- Yes.

11:47.006 --> 11:49.236
It's a real antique, sir.

11:49.341 --> 11:52.640
- Rare, they are.
- My wife is a collector.

11:52.745 --> 11:54.645
But I end up with them.

11:54.747 --> 11:57.648
I find it's a bit large
for my prey, sir.

11:57.750 --> 11:59.775
- Won't do at all.
- Don't count on it.

11:59.885 --> 12:01.978
- Do you like it here, sir?
- Very much.

12:02.088 --> 12:04.989
I hear it's pretty rough
in the States, sir.

12:05.091 --> 12:06.991
Have you seen some of it, sir?

12:07.093 --> 12:09.891
Bombin', riotin', snipin',
shootin' the blacks?

12:10.029 --> 12:11.929
Can't walk down the streets, they say.

12:12.031 --> 12:14.932
Was you involved in it, sir?
I mean, did you take part?

12:15.034 --> 12:16.695
See anybody get knifed?

12:16.802 --> 12:19.270
Just between commercials.

12:20.973 --> 12:22.907
Wanna put that down there?

12:25.010 --> 12:28.446
No, I'm just glad I'm here
where it's, uh, quiet...

12:28.547 --> 12:33.644
and you can breathe fresh air
and drink water that doesn't
have to come out of a bottle.

12:33.753 --> 12:36.916
It isn't water that I drink
out of a bottle, sir.

12:40.926 --> 12:43.986
Those two fellows will be up
to help you tomorrow.

12:53.405 --> 12:53.803
Kitty.!

12:55.608 --> 12:58.509
- You gonna have a crack at her, Norman?
- No.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.943
Ten months inside
is enough for me.

13:02.181 --> 13:04.479
- They got anything worth taking?
- Nope.

13:06.752 --> 13:08.652
Except, uh...

13:08.754 --> 13:11.154
these.

13:11.257 --> 13:13.157
- You bloody fool.
- It was nothing.

13:13.292 --> 13:15.487
She's got a dozen or more.

13:15.628 --> 13:18.529
Full of perfume.

13:20.432 --> 13:22.332
You like my trophy?

13:22.434 --> 13:24.334
Bugger your trophy.

13:24.436 --> 13:26.836
I want what was in 'em.

13:30.442 --> 13:33.343
I could do with
some of that too, Normie.

13:35.114 --> 13:37.014
Charlie Venner.

13:37.116 --> 13:39.516
He had some of it years ago...

13:39.618 --> 13:41.609
when she was here with her father.

13:41.720 --> 13:43.620
Venner's a bloody liar...

13:43.722 --> 13:45.622
and so are you.

13:49.428 --> 13:52.488
# Tell her, smell her
Lock her in the cellar #

13:52.631 --> 13:54.531
Kitty, kitty.
Where are you?

13:55.901 --> 13:57.801
Kitty.

14:00.973 --> 14:02.873
Kitty, kitty.

14:05.411 --> 14:07.208
Kitty, kitty.

14:07.313 --> 14:09.781
Kitty, kitty, kitty.

14:09.882 --> 14:12.442
Want a drink?

14:12.551 --> 14:14.576
I can't find the cat.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.587
Doesn't answer my call.

14:17.756 --> 14:20.281
Do I?

14:20.392 --> 14:22.326
You'd better.

14:32.104 --> 14:34.504
Why did you hire
Charlie Venner?

14:36.342 --> 14:38.742
I didn't. You did.

14:38.844 --> 14:40.744
Kitty.

14:40.846 --> 14:43.246
If she's in my study,
I'll kill her.

14:48.821 --> 14:50.721
What?

14:51.824 --> 14:53.758
Nothing.

15:14.146 --> 15:16.137
That your daddy's chair?

15:19.285 --> 15:21.753
Every chair is my daddy's chair.

15:36.702 --> 15:38.567
I'm glad we came.

15:44.476 --> 15:46.569
- What are you doing?
- Kiss me.

15:46.679 --> 15:48.909
Mmm.

15:51.016 --> 15:53.416
- You're an animal.
- Mm-mmm.

15:59.358 --> 16:02.850
Why'd you take my heater
out of the study?

16:04.997 --> 16:07.488
Because it's going upstairs.

16:07.633 --> 16:09.533
What happened?

16:13.906 --> 16:15.806
It's not going upstairs.

16:15.908 --> 16:17.671
It's freezing in there.

16:26.218 --> 16:28.345
Hello.

16:28.454 --> 16:30.854
I can see you're working at top speed.

16:30.956 --> 16:33.754
Is he in there studying?

16:35.894 --> 16:38.328
You'd better do something.

16:38.464 --> 16:41.365
- My husband will think all Englishmen are lazy.
- Let me help.

16:42.468 --> 16:44.129
Hey!

16:55.881 --> 16:59.180
Yeah, come on over here. This way.

17:00.285 --> 17:02.310
Watch your fingers, Chris.

17:11.463 --> 17:13.829
What was so funny with them?

17:16.268 --> 17:18.998
They just think
you're strange.

17:21.006 --> 17:22.973
Why, because I'm American?

17:24.476 --> 17:26.944
Mmm, no. No.

17:27.046 --> 17:29.139
Just strange.

17:32.818 --> 17:34.718
Do you think I'm strange?

17:36.455 --> 17:38.355
Occasionally.

17:41.126 --> 17:43.526
You act like you're 1 4.

17:45.864 --> 17:47.764
I am.

17:48.901 --> 17:50.801
Wanna try for 1 2?

17:53.672 --> 17:56.266
How about eight?
I freak out for eight-year-olds.

18:07.719 --> 18:10.847
- David?
- Huh?

18:10.956 --> 18:13.356
Will you please
get some lettuce?

18:14.993 --> 18:16.893
Okay.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.498
Oh, and fix
the damned toaster.

18:31.844 --> 18:34.745
What does she think
I'm doing here, playing games?

18:34.847 --> 18:36.747
What is this,
grammar school?

18:36.849 --> 18:38.749
Jesus Christ.

18:51.196 --> 18:53.596
Uh, we're leavin' now,
Mr. Sumner.

18:53.699 --> 18:56.532
- Mr. Riddaway be givin' us a lift.
- Fine.

18:57.936 --> 19:00.404
Oh, I was just sayin'
to your missus...

19:00.506 --> 19:04.272
that in a funny sort of way I feel
closer to rats than I do to people.

19:04.376 --> 19:07.812
Even though I kill 'em for a living.
Their dying is my living.

19:11.316 --> 19:14.547
Smell a rat, see a rat, kill a rat.
That's me, Chris Cawsey.

19:14.653 --> 19:18.054
I'd be lost without 'em.
It's true. I tell you straight.

19:18.157 --> 19:21.126
Cleverest thing you ever see
around these parts is a rat.

19:21.260 --> 19:23.660
Rats is life!

19:38.310 --> 19:40.870
Shove up,
you overgrown bastard.

19:40.979 --> 19:44.380
How's your day been?
Been up in a fat sheep, have ya?

19:46.485 --> 19:49.477
# Oh, you fluffy fleecy darlings #

19:49.588 --> 19:51.488
# You with the dark brown eyes #

19:51.590 --> 19:53.990
David?

19:54.092 --> 19:56.652
David.!

19:56.795 --> 19:58.820
Dinner's ready.!

20:00.032 --> 20:01.932
Did you hear me?

20:10.475 --> 20:13.171
- Hello, Major.
- Evening, Major.

20:13.278 --> 20:16.543
- Evening. - Will you be having
a pint with me then, Major?

20:16.648 --> 20:18.548
Not tonight.
I'll buy my own.

20:20.018 --> 20:21.952
Otherwise
we'd never get out of here.

20:22.054 --> 20:23.954
You know that.

20:24.056 --> 20:25.614
Yes, I do know that.

20:26.892 --> 20:29.019
Thanks, Harry.

20:29.161 --> 20:31.391
Excellent.

20:33.265 --> 20:35.563
- John.
- Evening, sir.

20:36.902 --> 20:38.802
- Fancy a game?
- Aye.

20:38.904 --> 20:40.804
- Evening, Harry.
- Evening.

20:43.375 --> 20:45.639
John Niles, come here to me.

20:45.744 --> 20:49.771
- Is this for a drink, Tom?
- No, this is for the truth.

20:51.049 --> 20:52.949
Your brother.

20:53.051 --> 20:54.951
Been hangin' around
the girls again.

20:55.053 --> 20:58.750
You'd better keep a closer watch,
or we'll be puttin' him away.

21:00.225 --> 21:02.420
It's all right, Pa.

21:02.561 --> 21:04.791
He's only throwing the ball
to 'em a little.

21:04.930 --> 21:06.830
A little's too much
for that sod.

21:06.932 --> 21:08.729
Watch your tongue, Norman.

21:08.834 --> 21:11.564
I'll watch nothin'
except my own ways.

21:11.670 --> 21:14.571
You watch your brother,
or I'll do it for you.

21:14.673 --> 21:17.471
If he ever makes
a mistake again in any way...

21:17.576 --> 21:20.477
I'll be the first
to have him put away.

21:23.715 --> 21:27.617
David.! You've been at it for hours.!

21:33.158 --> 21:35.058
Aah!

21:35.193 --> 21:38.128
- Gave me a fright, you did.
- You watching him, are you?

21:38.230 --> 21:40.630
Just lookin'.

21:43.969 --> 21:45.869
Do you fancy him?

21:48.273 --> 21:50.173
He's sweet, I think.

22:18.303 --> 22:20.203
Want anything?

22:27.813 --> 22:29.713
Want a tomato?

22:29.815 --> 22:32.477
No, thanks.

22:32.584 --> 22:34.984
Want a grapefruit?

22:54.573 --> 22:56.973
- Hey, hey.
- Your move.

22:57.075 --> 23:00.044
Okay.

23:05.517 --> 23:07.883
Check.

23:07.986 --> 23:11.387
- No, thank you.
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

23:11.490 --> 23:13.981
''This move now...

23:14.092 --> 23:17.528
''puts black into
a desperate plight...

23:17.662 --> 23:21.723
''with no possibility of mobilizing
his disorganized pieces.

23:21.867 --> 23:24.461
''Therefore, he begins
to return material...

23:24.569 --> 23:28.369
''to make progress
in developing at any price.

23:28.473 --> 23:32.500
Two pawns down,
white can conveniently--''

23:32.611 --> 23:37.480
Hey, I bet I can undress,
do my exercises and get into bed
before you make your next move.

23:37.582 --> 23:39.709
- Is it a deal?
- You're on.

23:41.553 --> 23:44.454
- Ah! No cheating.
- I'm not cheating.

23:54.099 --> 23:56.260
Shh, David.

23:59.905 --> 24:03.204
Aha! I have it.

24:06.311 --> 24:09.212
No, no, no, David,
just a minute.

24:09.314 --> 24:11.214
You're supposed to do a hundred.

24:11.316 --> 24:13.876
I did a hundred. I counted
by binary numbers. Make your move.

24:13.985 --> 24:15.885
- Binary numbers.
- Make your move.

24:15.987 --> 24:17.887
- Wait a minute.
- Come on.

24:22.561 --> 24:24.961
- What about that one there?
- No.

24:29.568 --> 24:32.469
- Uh--
- It's difficult, isn't it?

24:32.571 --> 24:34.471
Terribly.

24:34.573 --> 24:37.303
Just a minute.

24:37.409 --> 24:39.741
I think I have it.

24:39.845 --> 24:42.541
Um--

24:42.647 --> 24:44.842
Ooh.

24:46.051 --> 24:47.951
That puts you in.

25:08.807 --> 25:11.037
- Jesus!
- What are you doing?

25:11.142 --> 25:14.043
I gotta get my watch off.
You're an animal.

25:18.283 --> 25:20.717
Oh, for Christ's sake.

25:20.819 --> 25:22.719
I'm just setting the alarm.

25:30.128 --> 25:32.028
Are you finished?

25:37.269 --> 25:40.261
- Wait a minute.
- Oh, no. What now?

25:42.007 --> 25:43.907
David.

25:44.009 --> 25:46.773
David, what are you
doing down there?

25:46.878 --> 25:50.041
- Looking for a chess piece.
- What are you doing?

25:51.883 --> 25:53.783
Take a look.

25:56.388 --> 25:59.789
- Whoa. Did you find it?
- No, not that.

25:59.891 --> 26:02.860
Wait a minute.
Let me give you a hand.

26:02.994 --> 26:05.087
Aah.!

26:05.230 --> 26:07.596
David, no.!

26:07.699 --> 26:10.862
- No, wait! Wait a minute!
- You see it? Huh?

26:10.969 --> 26:13.164
- No, I didn't find it.
- I think it's a rook.

26:13.271 --> 26:16.604
No.! Aah.! No.!

26:16.708 --> 26:19.541
Mmm.! I love you.!

26:23.815 --> 26:25.715
I never cheat.

27:00.285 --> 27:02.515
Look, Amy,
don't play games with me.

27:04.856 --> 27:06.756
I've got a lot on my mind.

27:06.858 --> 27:09.258
You're not being fair.
I'm just trying to help.

27:16.067 --> 27:18.627
If you want to help,
then get your friends to finish.

27:18.737 --> 27:22.639
Get the garage makers and the
rat catchers-- Get them all to finish!

27:22.741 --> 27:26.006
- Oh.
- A-And fix the toilet
and clean up the kitchen.

27:26.111 --> 27:28.011
That would be a terrific help!

27:31.750 --> 27:35.083
I love you, Amy,
but I want you to leave me alone.

27:43.261 --> 27:45.161
Okay.

27:46.331 --> 27:49.198
I'll leave you alone
with your blackboard.

28:20.832 --> 28:22.766
Don't play games with me.

28:24.969 --> 28:26.869
No.

28:26.971 --> 28:29.337
Don't do it, Amy.

29:25.630 --> 29:28.531
They were practically licking my body.

29:28.633 --> 29:31.761
Who was practically
licking your body?

29:31.870 --> 29:33.770
Venner and Scutt.

29:34.939 --> 29:37.601
I congratulate them on their taste.

29:37.709 --> 29:40.109
Damn rat catcher staring at me.

29:41.880 --> 29:43.780
Why don't you wear a bra?

29:43.882 --> 29:45.782
Why should I?

29:47.819 --> 29:52.279
You shouldn't go around without one
and not expect that type to stare.

29:53.992 --> 29:55.892
Look...

29:56.027 --> 29:59.428
if you could hammer a nail, Venner
and Scutt wouldn't be out there.

30:02.534 --> 30:05.094
Listen, Amy, uh...

30:05.203 --> 30:08.104
fixing the toaster
and getting the garage built...

30:08.206 --> 30:11.869
is not exactly the reason
I came here in the first place.

30:11.976 --> 30:15.070
Are you saying
you'd be happier if we hadn't left?

30:15.180 --> 30:17.978
We left because
I got a grant to do work...

30:18.082 --> 30:20.676
which I haven't found
the time to do.

30:20.785 --> 30:23.151
You left because...

30:23.254 --> 30:26.883
you didn't want
to take a stand, commit.

30:28.293 --> 30:30.056
Commit to what?

30:35.867 --> 30:37.835
Huh?

30:42.540 --> 30:44.440
I was involved with my work.

30:44.542 --> 30:49.411
You want something out of me
that is not right to deliver.
That's not what I was there for.

30:56.621 --> 30:59.055
But I know why you're here.

31:02.126 --> 31:04.492
Why?

31:04.596 --> 31:07.997
Could it be because there's
no place else to hide?

31:29.821 --> 31:32.221
I'm here because you once said...

31:34.993 --> 31:38.429
y-you thought
we could be happier here.

31:39.797 --> 31:41.697
Remember?

31:45.203 --> 31:47.262
I'm sorry.

31:48.606 --> 31:51.507
Are you sorry sorry,
or just sorry?

31:56.514 --> 31:58.414
Sorry sorry.

31:58.516 --> 32:00.916
Then come here.

32:13.131 --> 32:15.031
I'm gonna take a bath.

32:15.133 --> 32:18.034
Why?
You don't need one.

32:18.136 --> 32:20.036
I think I do.

32:30.548 --> 32:32.516
Hey.

32:34.819 --> 32:38.915
By the way, I never claimed to be
one of the, uh, ''involved.''

33:02.080 --> 33:04.571
Don't forget
to draw the curtains.!

33:22.066 --> 33:23.966
- Hello.
- Hi.

33:28.673 --> 33:31.073
Thinking?

33:31.175 --> 33:33.075
Mm-hmm.

33:35.546 --> 33:38.447
- Don't want to come
for a walk, do you?
- Sure.

33:39.984 --> 33:41.884
When?

33:41.986 --> 33:43.886
In a little while.

33:46.791 --> 33:49.225
Hey, hey, come on.
Come on.

34:01.606 --> 34:03.506
Hello.

34:03.608 --> 34:05.508
Good evening.

34:07.612 --> 34:09.204
Kitty.! Kitty.!

34:09.313 --> 34:11.213
Kitty, kitty.

34:11.315 --> 34:15.513
David, I can't find the cat.!

34:15.620 --> 34:19.021
Can you forget the cat
and let me work for a minute!

34:22.126 --> 34:24.560
Kitty.!

34:24.661 --> 34:26.926
Kitty, kitty, kitty.

34:27.031 --> 34:28.965
Kitty.!

34:29.067 --> 34:30.967
Kitty.!

34:31.069 --> 34:34.505
Kitty? Kitty, kitty?

34:34.605 --> 34:37.096
'' Kitty, kitty.
Kitty, kitty, kitty.''

34:37.208 --> 34:39.768
- Shit.
- Here, kitty, kitty.

34:44.382 --> 34:46.282
Other side, sir.

34:57.228 --> 34:59.287
Hang on. Hang on.

34:59.430 --> 35:02.092
- Hold it, hold it.
- Wait for him for a minute.

35:39.804 --> 35:42.204
d Where be the blackbird d

35:44.308 --> 35:46.674
Oh!

35:50.314 --> 35:53.875
Hey, let him pass!
Let's see how good he is!

35:56.821 --> 35:58.982
Whoo!

36:01.926 --> 36:04.554
You're out of your mind.!

36:45.269 --> 36:48.204
- Hello, Henry.
- Hello,Janice.

36:48.306 --> 36:51.207
Henry! Come here!

36:51.309 --> 36:54.506
Oh, he's all right.
Aren't you, Henry?

37:04.989 --> 37:08.618
Henry, how many times
I gotta tell you, boy?

37:09.760 --> 37:11.660
You don't listen.

37:37.388 --> 37:39.288
Come on.

37:39.390 --> 37:41.790
Come on, Henry.
We're going home.

37:43.261 --> 37:45.161
What do you want?

37:45.263 --> 37:48.892
You'd have known for sure what
she was after 20 years ago, eh, Tom?

37:49.033 --> 37:51.763
Now, now, that'll do.

37:53.037 --> 37:56.302
- They still down at the hall bingoin'?
- Yeah.

37:56.407 --> 37:59.171
Tell her I'm behavin' meself.
I'll be along soon.

37:59.277 --> 38:01.108
Bobby.!

38:02.680 --> 38:04.580
Run along now.

38:07.685 --> 38:09.710
- Hello, David.
- Hi.

38:09.820 --> 38:11.378
Bobby!

38:12.823 --> 38:15.451
Take care of your sister, mind.

38:15.593 --> 38:17.493
I will, Dad.

38:17.595 --> 38:20.462
- Bye, Mr. Sumner.
- Good-bye.

38:30.541 --> 38:32.634
I'd like a scotch, double...

38:32.743 --> 38:34.973
with ice.

38:48.926 --> 38:50.860
Cheers.

38:58.969 --> 39:00.994
Evening, Major.

39:01.105 --> 39:01.339
- Evening, Major.
- Evening, Major.

39:01.339 --> 39:02.067
- Evening, Major.
- Evening, Major.

39:03.107 --> 39:05.701
- Mr. Sumner?
- Yes?

39:05.810 --> 39:09.769
I was about to call up to your farm to
welcome you into our little community.

39:09.880 --> 39:11.780
I've just been welcomed.

39:13.684 --> 39:15.481
-I'm John Scott.
- Hello.

39:15.586 --> 39:18.987
I saw your car outside. I thought
perhaps we could drive up together.

39:19.090 --> 39:21.251
I wanted to have
the good Reverend and Mrs. Hood...

39:21.359 --> 39:25.352
talk you into joining us at the
church social this coming Thursday.

39:25.496 --> 39:27.521
The vicar will run me home.

39:27.665 --> 39:30.395
Can I buy you a drink, Major,
before you go?

39:30.501 --> 39:34.164
No, thank you, Tom.
We're in a hurry.

39:42.480 --> 39:44.380
Buy 'em all one.

39:50.154 --> 39:52.213
- Good night, Major.
- Good night, Major.

39:52.323 --> 39:54.348
Watch out for sheep.!

39:54.458 --> 39:57.359
You got your
Wellington boots on, Major?

39:59.463 --> 40:02.330
dNow, some men
goes for women d

40:02.433 --> 40:05.334
d And some men
goes for boys d

40:05.436 --> 40:08.337
d But my love's
warm and beautiful d

40:08.439 --> 40:10.600
d And makes
a baa-in' noise

40:10.708 --> 40:13.609
Amy, nice to see you.

40:13.711 --> 40:16.874
- Major, why haven't you
been out to see us before?
- Shearing time. My apologies.

40:16.981 --> 40:19.882
- I see you brought my drunken husband home.
- Come on, I'm not drunk yet.

40:19.984 --> 40:21.542
Certainly not my fault.

40:21.652 --> 40:23.620
- Hi. I'm David Sumner.
- I just brought him home.

40:23.721 --> 40:25.621
- Barny Hood.
- Reverend.

40:25.723 --> 40:27.623
- My wife.
- Mrs. Hood.

40:27.725 --> 40:30.660
- Hello.
- Well, well. Please sit down.

40:30.761 --> 40:33.127
- Barny. Louise.
- Hello, Major.

40:38.469 --> 40:40.960
What are you drinking, Reverend?

40:41.071 --> 40:42.971
Scotch.

40:52.283 --> 40:54.376
The reverend and his wife...

40:54.485 --> 40:57.386
came to invite us to a party
at the church hall next week, David.

40:57.488 --> 40:59.388
Oh.

40:59.490 --> 41:02.789
Well, it's, uh, going to be more than
an invitation, Reverend, isn't it?

41:02.927 --> 41:05.452
Major, you gave away
our secret plan.

41:05.596 --> 41:08.497
- Who said anything about money?
- I was thinking of about five--

41:08.599 --> 41:11.159
I'll take it.
Thank you very much.

41:11.268 --> 41:14.203
And I expect to see you both
at the social and at the church...

41:14.305 --> 41:16.205
when you can spare the time.

41:16.307 --> 41:20.937
Time is a little difficult to find
these days. Uh, so are cats.

41:21.045 --> 41:24.708
By the way, Amy, did you find
your, uh, kitty, kitty, kitty?

41:25.916 --> 41:27.816
No.

41:27.918 --> 41:30.819
At least give us some hope
about your coming to church.

41:30.921 --> 41:34.516
- Yes. After all, hope is your business,
Barny, isn't it?
- Yes, and faith.

41:34.625 --> 41:37.856
And charity.

41:37.995 --> 41:40.896
- Thanks.
- Amy's been telling us
why you came to Wakely.

41:40.998 --> 41:43.865
- To write, to meditate.
- Why did you come?

41:43.968 --> 41:46.163
I was drafted.

41:46.270 --> 41:48.204
- Well, tell us what you do.
- Okay.

41:49.306 --> 41:52.104
I'm a, uh,
astral mathematician.

41:52.209 --> 41:54.439
Oh. Never heard of it.

41:54.545 --> 41:57.275
That's because I just made it up.

41:57.381 --> 41:59.246
I'll get you another drink.

41:59.350 --> 42:02.046
I have a grant to study, uh...

42:02.152 --> 42:05.986
possible structures
in stellar interiors...

42:06.090 --> 42:08.854
and the implications regarding
their radiation characteristics.

42:08.959 --> 42:12.156
- Am I boring anyone?
- Radiation-- That's an unfortunate dispensation.

42:12.296 --> 42:15.459
It surely is.
Yes, indeed.

42:15.566 --> 42:18.729
As long as it's not
another bomb.

42:18.836 --> 42:22.101
You're a scientist.
Can you deny the responsibility?

42:22.206 --> 42:23.764
Can you?

42:25.609 --> 42:28.510
After all, there's never been
a kingdom given to so much bloodshed...

42:28.612 --> 42:30.842
as that of Christ.

42:32.116 --> 42:35.085
- That's Montesquieu, isn't it?
- Oh, really?

42:35.185 --> 42:37.415
Who's he?

42:39.323 --> 42:41.223
Somebody well worth reading.

42:45.496 --> 42:47.555
We'd better leave
these good people.

42:47.698 --> 42:50.895
Yes, well, you won't let me
walk home, will you, Barny?

42:51.001 --> 42:53.265
Mrs. Hood,
you're very lovely.

42:53.370 --> 42:55.770
- I'll get your coat.
- Does God bore you, Amy?

42:55.873 --> 42:58.774
In the areas of boredom, Mrs. Hood,
God is not my problem.

42:58.876 --> 43:01.709
- Your wife tells me you play
an interesting game of chess.
- Yeah, I guess I do.

43:02.713 --> 43:04.943
You were... awful
to the reverend.

43:05.049 --> 43:07.313
No, no, no, no.
I wasn't.

43:07.418 --> 43:10.979
He's all right.
I like him.

43:11.088 --> 43:12.988
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

43:13.090 --> 43:15.183
His wife is very attractive.

43:15.292 --> 43:17.726
Oh.

43:17.828 --> 43:20.228
Yes, she is, isn't she?

43:23.667 --> 43:27.569
- Here, I think I--
I think you need some help.

43:29.340 --> 43:31.240
- David.
- Hmm?

43:31.342 --> 43:34.072
What's a binary number?

43:34.178 --> 43:37.875
Uh, zeroes or ones...

43:37.982 --> 43:39.882
plus or minus.

43:41.051 --> 43:43.952
In sequences of twos.

43:44.054 --> 43:46.113
Hey, that's right.

43:48.125 --> 43:50.025
You're a bright lady.

43:52.162 --> 43:53.789
You're not so dumb.

43:55.165 --> 43:56.962
Sometimes I need help.

43:57.067 --> 43:59.001
When?

44:00.904 --> 44:03.737
Like, um, now, maybe.

44:08.579 --> 44:10.479
You got it.

44:17.054 --> 44:19.079
What's the matter?

45:01.932 --> 45:04.662
Scutt or Cawsey.

45:09.006 --> 45:12.442
I've locked all the doors
and windows downstairs.

45:12.543 --> 45:15.205
Let's keep them locked
from now on. All right?

45:15.312 --> 45:17.212
Great.

45:22.086 --> 45:23.986
Did you hear me?

45:24.088 --> 45:25.988
What?

45:26.090 --> 45:28.524
Scutt or Cawsey.

45:30.194 --> 45:33.686
- Why? - To prove to you they could
get into your bedroom.

45:37.334 --> 45:40.303
I don't believe that.

45:40.404 --> 45:43.805
Well, who else
is around all the time?

45:43.907 --> 45:45.807
Amy, uh...

45:45.909 --> 45:48.309
we've left all...
the doors unlocked.

45:48.412 --> 45:51.040
I mean, it could have
been anybody passing.

45:51.148 --> 45:53.048
''Anybody passing''?

45:53.150 --> 45:56.051
David, a complete stranger
comes into our house...

45:56.153 --> 45:59.213
and decides to strangle our cat
and hang her in the wardrobe?

45:59.323 --> 46:01.655
Somebody passing?

46:17.341 --> 46:20.242
Cawsey or Scutt.

46:25.082 --> 46:25.315
Here, Charlie.
It's bloody heavy.

46:25.315 --> 46:25.542
Here, Charlie.
It's bloody heavy.

46:27.751 --> 46:30.652
Lousy way to make a livin; though.

46:30.754 --> 46:33.154
You gonna look at them all day?

46:36.026 --> 46:38.927
Would you feel better
if I went out and talked to them?

46:39.029 --> 46:42.590
Not necessarily.
Perhaps we could just pack up and leave.

46:44.134 --> 46:46.034
Nobody's leaving.

46:47.571 --> 46:49.869
Why? Because we paid for a year?

46:51.208 --> 46:54.302
Look, Amy,
I'm not going to...

46:54.411 --> 46:57.312
just go out there
and blatantly accuse them.

46:58.415 --> 47:00.747
You don't have to accuse them.

47:00.851 --> 47:05.811
You could start by mentioning that our
cat was strangled and see what happens.

47:08.225 --> 47:10.785
You can believe in the possibility,
can't you?

47:10.928 --> 47:13.089
Okay. Okay.

47:14.965 --> 47:18.492
I'll go out and mention to them
that the cat is missing...

47:18.602 --> 47:21.503
and I'll ask them
if they've seen her.

47:23.607 --> 47:26.508
All right,
let's see what it's good for.

47:27.878 --> 47:30.540
- You don't think that's enough, do you?
- Not quite.

47:32.316 --> 47:35.717
Perhaps you'd like to write them
a note on your blackboard.

47:39.623 --> 47:42.524
Well, I thought he might enjoy it.

48:01.044 --> 48:03.774
- How are you?
- Fine, thank you, sir.

48:03.881 --> 48:06.372
- How's it, uh, going up there?
- It's all right, sir.

48:06.483 --> 48:08.713
Yeah. Want a smoke?

48:08.819 --> 48:11.788
I like the smell of those
American cigarettes, Mr. Sumner.

48:15.626 --> 48:20.222
Can you give me a hand with that
mantrap? Just wanna get it in the house.

48:35.312 --> 48:37.507
Uh, right through here.

48:37.614 --> 48:39.980
Right here by the fireplace.

48:40.083 --> 48:41.983
Thanks.

48:47.157 --> 48:50.388
Amy, listen.
I'm gonna catch them off guard.

48:50.527 --> 48:53.428
- When?
- Right now.

48:53.530 --> 48:56.090
Open or closed, Mr. Sumner?

48:58.235 --> 49:00.226
Uh, gee, I don't know.

49:02.005 --> 49:03.939
Uh, open it.

49:06.443 --> 49:09.003
If you can.

49:15.719 --> 49:17.619
Sorry, Charlie.

49:17.721 --> 49:19.621
Bite, sir.

49:21.124 --> 49:23.024
I can appreciate that.

49:24.761 --> 49:26.661
Be careful.

49:29.299 --> 49:31.233
Watch that hand
on the spring.

49:31.335 --> 49:33.735
Pretty dangerous thing, sir.

49:38.909 --> 49:41.969
- This is the, uh, safety lock, sir.
- Right.

49:42.079 --> 49:43.979
Where would you like it, sir?

49:44.081 --> 49:46.675
Uh, put it right over
the fireplace there.

49:53.557 --> 49:55.787
You fellows like some beer?

49:55.892 --> 49:58.827
- Very nice.
- Oh, very welcome.

50:05.168 --> 50:07.500
Thank you.

50:12.009 --> 50:13.909
Cheers.

50:23.353 --> 50:25.344
Uh, cheers, miss.

50:25.455 --> 50:27.719
Cheers.

50:29.493 --> 50:31.552
- Mr. Sumner.
- Huh?

50:31.695 --> 50:34.596
Would you like to
shoot with us sometime?

50:35.932 --> 50:38.196
Oh, I've, uh--
I never hunted much.

50:39.436 --> 50:42.633
Oh, but you've, uh,
shot, Mr. Sumner?

50:44.541 --> 50:46.873
Just once or twice,
but that was--

50:46.977 --> 50:49.275
Be easy then.
You should try it, sir.

50:49.379 --> 50:53.281
Living here at Trencher's, with good
shootin'outside the door. Eh, Norman?

50:53.383 --> 50:55.442
Right. Right, sir.

51:00.857 --> 51:02.757
When?

51:02.859 --> 51:04.724
How about tomorrow, sir?

51:08.999 --> 51:10.899
Okay. Thank you.

51:11.001 --> 51:15.267
That m-- That might be... fun.
I'd like that.

51:15.372 --> 51:17.772
Thank you.

51:22.212 --> 51:24.112
What about the garage?

51:24.214 --> 51:25.909
It can wait.

51:34.724 --> 51:37.716
We'll meet at Wakely
at about half past 8:00.

51:37.861 --> 51:40.955
- You know the pub?
- Yes, I do.

51:41.098 --> 51:43.430
Well, we'd better
get back to work, sir.

51:43.533 --> 51:45.763
Thank you for putting that up.

51:45.869 --> 51:48.269
That's all right, sir.

51:48.371 --> 51:50.464
Oh, I, uh,
I don't have a gun.

51:50.574 --> 51:52.474
But, uh--

51:52.576 --> 51:54.100
will this do?

51:54.211 --> 51:56.111
Ah.

51:56.213 --> 51:58.340
There'll be plenty extra, sir.

51:58.448 --> 52:00.217
Good.

52:00.217 --> 52:02.117
- Thank you for the drink, sir.
- Thank you.

52:02.219 --> 52:04.119
- You're welcome.
- Thanks for the drink, sir.

52:04.221 --> 52:05.950
Oh, it's my pleasure.

52:41.725 --> 52:44.660
Hey, Charlie, Charlie.
Wait, wait, wait.

53:15.091 --> 53:17.150
Break it, Mr. Sumner.

53:17.294 --> 53:19.694
- Why? It's not loaded.
- Break it.

53:23.466 --> 53:25.366
Now you're sure.

53:53.997 --> 53:58.093
Uh, this'll be you
right over here, Mr. Sumner.

53:58.201 --> 54:00.101
Right.

54:03.807 --> 54:05.707
Now, here's your sack.

54:06.943 --> 54:09.673
We'll beat the ducks
right to ya.

54:09.779 --> 54:11.679
- Small, they are.
- Yeah.

54:11.781 --> 54:16.343
We don't want it broken up
with shot unless you have to.

54:16.453 --> 54:20.617
But, uh, if--
if you can't catch 'em...

54:20.724 --> 54:22.624
shoot 'em.

54:22.759 --> 54:25.227
They might come
right down here, sir.

54:25.362 --> 54:29.162
- Or they might come
from behind as well, sir.
- But I don't move?

54:29.266 --> 54:31.734
Stay as still
as you can be, sir.

54:34.170 --> 54:37.264
Now, we'll be spread about.
If you need us,just call.

54:37.374 --> 54:40.969
You do that.
Here's your sack, Norman.

54:43.913 --> 54:47.508
- You drive 'em to me, Charlie.
- I will.

54:47.617 --> 54:49.676
Uh, good luck, sir.

54:55.225 --> 54:57.193
Might be a little while, sir.

54:58.461 --> 55:00.292
I'll be here.

56:29.519 --> 56:31.419
Who is it?

56:49.038 --> 56:51.404
Is David all right?

56:51.508 --> 56:54.272
He's fine.
Enjoying himself.

56:55.812 --> 56:57.712
May I come in?

56:58.882 --> 57:00.713
All right.

57:05.355 --> 57:07.448
- Would you like a drink?
- I'd love one.

57:26.509 --> 57:29.478
Would you like me to go?
I will, you know.

57:31.214 --> 57:32.704
No.

57:32.816 --> 57:34.716
Stay and have your drink.

57:34.818 --> 57:36.853
I'd like to know
what you think of cats.

57:36.853 --> 57:37.717
I'd like to know
what you think of cats.

57:44.594 --> 57:46.494
I do fancy cats.

57:57.640 --> 57:59.540
Please leave me.

58:04.080 --> 58:05.980
No.

58:15.358 --> 58:17.258
Get out!

58:37.146 --> 58:39.046
Don't tease me, Amy.

58:41.117 --> 58:43.017
Please.

58:54.030 --> 58:56.692
Aah! Aah!

58:56.799 --> 58:58.699
No!

58:58.801 --> 59:00.632
Aah!

59:28.798 --> 59:30.698
No.

59:30.800 --> 59:32.859
Please, Charlie.

59:39.976 --> 59:41.876
Amy.

59:41.978 --> 59:45.277
I don't want to reave you, but I will.

59:50.587 --> 59:52.953
No.

59:53.056 --> 59:56.287
No. No.

01:00:07.337 --> 01:00:09.965
No! No!

01:00:21.918 --> 01:00:23.852
No!

01:00:23.953 --> 01:00:26.945
No!

01:00:27.056 --> 01:00:30.423
No.

01:00:42.939 --> 01:00:44.839
Amy!

01:01:25.581 --> 01:01:27.742
N-No.

01:02:20.870 --> 01:02:22.770
Easy.

01:02:59.542 --> 01:03:01.476
I'm sorry, Amy.

01:03:01.577 --> 01:03:03.477
I'm sorry.

01:03:03.579 --> 01:03:05.479
Hold me.

01:03:07.950 --> 01:03:10.077
Hold me.

01:05:10.006 --> 01:05:12.975
No.

01:05:16.646 --> 01:05:19.979
No.! No.! No.!

01:07:21.203 --> 01:07:23.501
Why didn't you open the closet?

01:07:23.606 --> 01:07:25.836
We don't have any more cats.

01:07:33.282 --> 01:07:36.274
I'm firing Venner
and Scutt tomorrow.

01:07:37.653 --> 01:07:39.587
Hooray for you, tiger.

01:07:44.894 --> 01:07:46.794
What for?

01:07:50.232 --> 01:07:53.599
Because they stuck it to me
on the moor today.

01:07:53.702 --> 01:07:57.160
They also serve
who sit at home and wait.

01:07:58.707 --> 01:08:00.868
What?

01:08:00.976 --> 01:08:03.501
Nothing. If you'd have said
something to them ages ago...

01:08:03.612 --> 01:08:05.944
-about the cat, this would
never have happened.
- Easy.

01:08:06.048 --> 01:08:08.073
- None of it.
- Easy, easy.

01:08:08.184 --> 01:08:10.516
I was going to say something
until you pulled that childish stunt...

01:08:10.619 --> 01:08:13.349
and ruined any chance
I had of finding out.

01:08:13.456 --> 01:08:15.356
- David, I didn't--
- I didn't finish.

01:08:15.458 --> 01:08:18.256
- You pushed me, and you don't do
any good by pushing.
- I didn't.

01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:27.401
When are you ever gonna
learn about growing up, huh?

01:08:29.205 --> 01:08:31.104
I'm trying to.

01:08:31.207 --> 01:08:33.265
Well, you're a little late.

01:08:36.412 --> 01:08:40.644
Why didn't you ask him
instead of making me look like
an idiot with that bowl of milk?

01:08:40.749 --> 01:08:43.149
You're a coward.

01:08:45.386 --> 01:08:47.617
- No, I'm not.
-And I'm a coward.

01:08:48.890 --> 01:08:50.791
Plain and simple.

01:08:50.926 --> 01:08:53.053
No, I'm not.

01:08:53.194 --> 01:08:57.096
I don't blame you
for hiding in your study.

01:08:57.198 --> 01:08:59.099
I don't--

01:08:59.201 --> 01:09:01.362
I don't want to
hide there with you.

01:09:03.037 --> 01:09:07.475
I-- I can't anymore.

01:09:14.250 --> 01:09:16.149
Okay.

01:09:19.087 --> 01:09:21.818
Easy, easy, easy.

01:09:33.903 --> 01:09:36.736
- You're fired, all of you.
- I beg your pardon, sir?

01:09:36.839 --> 01:09:39.273
I've noted the hours
that you've worked...

01:09:39.375 --> 01:09:43.072
and I've deducted...
the-the time wasted.

01:09:43.179 --> 01:09:46.580
- Here. It's all here.
- Why, sir? Why are we fired?

01:09:46.682 --> 01:09:48.979
We may not work the way
you like to work, sir--

01:09:49.084 --> 01:09:51.951
- Listen to me.
- Sir, I mean, why?

01:09:52.054 --> 01:09:55.717
You're fired because I don't want you
around. I want you to leave. Right now.

01:09:55.824 --> 01:09:58.418
- Is that clear?
- We've been working all the time, sir.

01:09:58.561 --> 01:10:00.654
Clear enough, sir.

01:10:30.626 --> 01:10:32.560
- Norman.
- Huh?

01:10:32.661 --> 01:10:35.562
That's a nice way
to treat people.

01:11:33.555 --> 01:11:36.888
We're due at the church hall at 8:00.

01:12:09.725 --> 01:12:13.183
I'd like you
to meet Amy and David Sumner.

01:12:13.329 --> 01:12:16.526
- Hello. Nice to meet you. My husband.
- Hello, Mr. Sumner.

01:12:16.632 --> 01:12:18.566
Hello, Amy.
Nice of you to come.

01:12:18.667 --> 01:12:21.795
I'll show you to your seats.

01:12:21.904 --> 01:12:24.737
Hello, Reverend.
How have you been?

01:12:40.022 --> 01:12:41.956
- Please sit here.
- Thank you.

01:12:42.057 --> 01:12:44.491
- I think she'll be able
to see okay from here.
- That's fine.

01:12:57.005 --> 01:12:59.974
Would you care for a drink?

01:13:01.443 --> 01:13:03.638
All right. Thank you.

01:13:16.358 --> 01:13:19.327
I hope you enjoy the show.

01:13:19.428 --> 01:13:21.919
Thank you.

01:13:22.064 --> 01:13:24.464
Be brave.

01:13:38.947 --> 01:13:43.441
Evening, ladies and gentlemen...

01:13:47.923 --> 01:13:49.857
and welcome to our
annual social gathering.

01:13:49.958 --> 01:13:53.257
It's nice to see again
all the old familiar faces.

01:13:53.395 --> 01:13:55.386
And the not-so-old,
indeed, as well.

01:13:55.531 --> 01:13:59.023
To begin the evening, we have
our very own Reverend Barnard Hood.

01:13:59.168 --> 01:14:02.569
Your vicar,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:14:02.671 --> 01:14:07.870
Thank you very much.
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
for my famous newspaper trick.

01:14:07.976 --> 01:14:10.001
Tore it up last year, Barny!

01:14:10.112 --> 01:14:13.809
Yes, and I might well
next year, too, Tom.

01:14:17.119 --> 01:14:19.679
Here we are, ladies and gentlemen--
a very simple trick.

01:14:19.788 --> 01:14:22.655
I simply tear a piece
of newspaper down the center so.

01:14:22.758 --> 01:14:26.421
Tear it again.
Fold it towards me.

01:14:26.562 --> 01:14:28.894
Music, please.

01:14:28.997 --> 01:14:33.730
Open it up very carefully.
Tear it again.

01:14:33.836 --> 01:14:36.862
There we are.
Roll it towards me again.

01:14:36.972 --> 01:14:39.202
- You enjoy this, Mrs.Johnson?
- Yes, Vicar.

01:14:39.308 --> 01:14:42.505
It is a good trick, isn't it? I do it
in front of the mirror every night.

01:14:42.611 --> 01:14:44.841
And we begin to open up.

01:14:44.947 --> 01:14:47.609
- I always enjoy doing this.
It gives me a chance to...
- Hello, David.

01:14:47.716 --> 01:14:49.149
catch up with my reading.

01:14:49.251 --> 01:14:51.151
Hi.

01:14:54.156 --> 01:14:56.351
You want a smoke?

01:14:56.458 --> 01:15:00.656
And I find that
it hasn't been torn at all.

01:15:00.796 --> 01:15:03.629
- No. - What?
- Don't smoke in here.

01:15:03.732 --> 01:15:06.223
And you'll also find that
that one isn't torn either.

01:15:06.368 --> 01:15:09.303
Sorry about that, ladies and gentlemen.

01:15:09.404 --> 01:15:12.066
But I think
you'll probably find that...

01:15:12.174 --> 01:15:14.870
it hasn't been torn at all.

01:15:19.581 --> 01:15:23.278
- Hello, Henry.
- Hello.

01:15:25.554 --> 01:15:29.012
I'd like to go for a walk.

01:15:29.124 --> 01:15:32.252
- Will you take my arm?
- Now, ladies and gentlemen...

01:15:32.394 --> 01:15:34.589
for my piece de resistance...

01:15:34.730 --> 01:15:38.222
I now present to you an empty glass.

01:15:38.367 --> 01:15:40.767
I am now going to fill
this glass with milk.

01:15:40.869 --> 01:15:43.633
Would it work better
with whiskey, vicar?

01:15:43.739 --> 01:15:45.934
- Nothing works better with whiskey.
- I do.

01:15:46.041 --> 01:15:48.134
You've never worked
in your life, Tom.

01:15:52.648 --> 01:15:57.108
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
I take the lid off my cocoa tin.

01:15:57.219 --> 01:16:01.349
And very carefully now,
I place the glass...

01:16:01.456 --> 01:16:04.983
into the tin
and replace the lid.

01:16:05.127 --> 01:16:08.619
I take up my wand
and I utter the magic words--

01:16:15.237 --> 01:16:17.569
What do we find in the tin...

01:16:17.673 --> 01:16:21.040
but one complete...

01:16:21.143 --> 01:16:23.134
glass of milk.

01:16:23.245 --> 01:16:27.238
- Yea.!
- Good old Barny!

01:16:27.349 --> 01:16:30.978
If I could convert you
to this, Tom, that would be a miracle.

01:16:35.190 --> 01:16:38.216
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Major.

01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:41.454
The next item on this evening's
program, ladies and gentlemen...

01:16:41.597 --> 01:16:44.998
- You want to go?
- Yeah.

01:16:45.100 --> 01:16:49.002
...who will sing for you the aria
Caranome from the opera Rigoletto.

01:17:27.476 --> 01:17:30.104
Dad?
It's Janice.

01:17:30.212 --> 01:17:33.375
She made off to the yard.
Then she went walking with Henry Niles.

01:17:33.482 --> 01:17:35.712
He was holding her, Dad.
Touching her.

01:17:35.817 --> 01:17:38.786
John Niles.

01:17:38.887 --> 01:17:41.617
What's the matter, Tom?

01:17:49.031 --> 01:17:51.397
Come with me.

01:17:58.373 --> 01:18:01.001
All over her, he was.
Touching her.

01:18:02.811 --> 01:18:05.746
Had his hands all over her.

01:18:20.395 --> 01:18:22.363
Don't be afraid, Henry.

01:18:22.497 --> 01:18:24.397
- I'll find him.
- No.

01:18:24.499 --> 01:18:26.467
Let the boys find Janice.
The rest can wait.

01:18:29.337 --> 01:18:31.635
Have you ever kissed
anyone, Henry?

01:18:31.740 --> 01:18:34.106
No.

01:18:34.209 --> 01:18:37.576
Get your mates to find her. I'll be
waiting in the pub. Get all of them!

01:18:39.047 --> 01:18:41.948
Would you like to kiss me?

01:18:52.994 --> 01:18:55.019
Go on. Find him!

01:18:56.832 --> 01:18:59.733
Would you now all please stand?

01:19:17.719 --> 01:19:22.053
As these lights are
extinguished in our eyes...

01:19:23.391 --> 01:19:28.090
and also in the presence of God,
the Blessed Virgin...

01:19:28.230 --> 01:19:30.460
and all the saints--

01:19:35.003 --> 01:19:39.736
Deliver unto the devil
a punishment with eternal fire.

01:19:41.109 --> 01:19:44.442
Dwell without him...

01:19:44.546 --> 01:19:48.676
unless ye repent.

01:19:48.784 --> 01:19:51.412
-Janice?
-Janice.!

01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:54.512
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:19:54.623 --> 01:19:58.525
- I have to go.
- No. No, they might hurt you.

01:20:05.433 --> 01:20:07.401
- Janice.!
- Come here.!

01:20:07.536 --> 01:20:10.699
- Where are you,Janice?
- Henry.!

01:20:12.073 --> 01:20:14.837
Janice.!

01:20:27.289 --> 01:20:30.258
We don't know where she is.
We looked the whole town!

01:20:30.358 --> 01:20:33.225
- Keep looking.
- The fog's coming down.

01:20:33.328 --> 01:20:36.695
Did you try the lorries and such,
parked outside the meeting house?

01:20:36.798 --> 01:20:38.823
- Then do it!
- I'll go with him, Pa.

01:20:38.967 --> 01:20:41.800
- Janice?
- Janice.!

01:20:43.872 --> 01:20:46.340
Janice.!

01:21:05.126 --> 01:21:07.856
We're almost home now.

01:21:14.803 --> 01:21:17.067
Can I help?

01:21:20.141 --> 01:21:22.041
David!

01:21:25.914 --> 01:21:28.747
Jesus! I couldn't stop.

01:21:28.850 --> 01:21:32.149
- Oh, God, David.!
- Easy.

01:21:33.855 --> 01:21:36.187
Okay. Get the keys.

01:21:36.291 --> 01:21:38.521
Easy. Easy.

01:21:41.429 --> 01:21:44.830
-
-
David,you know it's Henry Niles?

01:21:44.933 --> 01:21:46.833
I don't want him here.

01:21:46.935 --> 01:21:49.665
He's hurt.

01:21:49.771 --> 01:21:52.831
I don't want him in my house.

01:21:52.941 --> 01:21:56.206
Fine. You get upstairs.
You go to bed.

01:21:56.311 --> 01:21:59.144
Take a bath.
You just get out of here.

01:22:01.082 --> 01:22:04.449
He'll stay until the doctor comes.

01:22:04.552 --> 01:22:07.453
What do you mean,
you don't want him in your house?

01:22:17.866 --> 01:22:20.801
- David, did you get anyone?
- No.!

01:22:20.936 --> 01:22:24.804
I tried the doctor. He's not home,
and the consul's not either.

01:22:24.906 --> 01:22:29.138
Nobody answers.
I'm calling the pub.

01:22:41.923 --> 01:22:45.256
- Wakely Arms.
- Hello, this is David Sumner.

01:22:46.561 --> 01:22:49.189
No. No, he ain't.

01:22:49.331 --> 01:22:53.290
Oh. Well, when he comes in,
tell him to call Trencher's Farm.

01:22:53.435 --> 01:22:56.802
I've got Henry Niles here.

01:22:56.905 --> 01:22:58.873
Right.

01:22:58.974 --> 01:23:01.272
It was the American,
looking for Allsopp.

01:23:01.376 --> 01:23:04.140
He hit Henry Niles with his car.

01:23:04.245 --> 01:23:06.577
He's got him up at Trencher's.

01:23:10.085 --> 01:23:12.645
Bottle.

01:23:12.754 --> 01:23:14.654
And another.

01:23:52.727 --> 01:23:55.525
Let Norman and me go in, Tom.

01:23:55.630 --> 01:23:57.530
We know the American.

01:23:57.632 --> 01:24:01.534
- I want to know where myJanice is.
- We'll find out, Tom.

01:24:01.669 --> 01:24:04.263
Riddaway will stay with you, Tom.

01:24:04.372 --> 01:24:06.863
That I will.

01:24:17.919 --> 01:24:21.184
- You have Henry Niles in there?
- Wait a minute. Is the doctor with you?

01:24:21.289 --> 01:24:23.951
- We want to see Niles.
- Why? What's the matter?

01:24:25.593 --> 01:24:27.788
Wake up!

01:24:27.929 --> 01:24:30.864
- Wake up!
- Don't try to kid us
you're sleeping. Come on.!

01:24:30.965 --> 01:24:33.559
- Hey, wait a minute, now.
- Come on! Come on!

01:24:33.668 --> 01:24:35.829
He's hurt.
He could have a broken rib.

01:24:35.937 --> 01:24:37.837
Oh. Sorry, sir.

01:24:39.707 --> 01:24:43.666
He'll have more than a broken rib if he
doesn't tell us whereJanice Hedden is.

01:24:43.778 --> 01:24:46.576
- What aboutJanice Hedden?
- Took her, he did.

01:24:46.681 --> 01:24:48.808
What have you done with Janice Hedden,
you dirty pervert?

01:24:48.917 --> 01:24:51.750
Lookee here. He played
his filthy tricks on Janice Hedden.

01:24:51.853 --> 01:24:54.014
He took her, and he was seen
with his hands on her body.

01:24:54.122 --> 01:24:56.352
She run, he run after her,
and now she's missing.

01:24:56.458 --> 01:24:58.517
- Look, I understand your concern--
- You--

01:24:58.660 --> 01:25:01.185
Don't touch him!
Don't do that.

01:25:05.433 --> 01:25:08.027
Don't lay your hands on me!

01:25:11.739 --> 01:25:15.402
It's none of your business,
and it never has been.

01:25:18.079 --> 01:25:19.979
That's fine.

01:25:22.117 --> 01:25:24.176
But you can't hit him.

01:25:24.285 --> 01:25:27.152
Listen, Mr. Sumner...

01:25:27.255 --> 01:25:30.088
we come to get
this bloody freak.

01:25:30.191 --> 01:25:32.250
And we're gonna get him...

01:25:32.393 --> 01:25:35.294
with your cooperation or without it.

01:25:35.396 --> 01:25:38.331
David, stop it.!

01:25:47.442 --> 01:25:49.569
Hey, listen.

01:25:49.677 --> 01:25:53.704
Listen, Henry, did you see
Janice Hedden tonight?

01:25:53.815 --> 01:25:56.875
Of course he did. Ain't you listenin'
to me? He did his dirty numbers on her.

01:25:56.985 --> 01:26:00.318
Just take it easy.
Henry, listen to me.

01:26:00.421 --> 01:26:05.859
Did you takeJanice Hedden out
of the meeting house tonight? Huh?

01:26:05.994 --> 01:26:08.963
Listen to me. Please.

01:26:09.097 --> 01:26:12.089
Gentlemen, he's helpless.
Look at him. He couldn't hurt a fly.

01:26:15.170 --> 01:26:18.333
You'd be better off looking for
Janice Hedden than standing around here.

01:26:18.439 --> 01:26:20.873
You know?

01:26:20.975 --> 01:26:24.035
All right. We go find Janice,
you go find the doctor.

01:26:30.785 --> 01:26:32.685
I'm not leaving him here
with my wife.

01:26:32.787 --> 01:26:34.778
- Thought you said he was helpless.
- Yeah.

01:26:34.889 --> 01:26:37.483
You wouldn't leave him alone with your
wife or your kid, if you had one.

01:26:37.592 --> 01:26:40.584
Oh, that's different, huh?

01:26:40.728 --> 01:26:43.162
Look-- Look, fella.

01:26:43.298 --> 01:26:46.267
He's staying here with me until
the doctor and the police arrive.

01:26:46.401 --> 01:26:49.564
- He's my responsibility.
- Your responsibility?

01:26:49.671 --> 01:26:52.265
- That's right.
- Why?

01:26:59.714 --> 01:27:02.478
This is my house.

01:27:05.687 --> 01:27:08.986
Okay, come on.

01:27:09.090 --> 01:27:11.024
Come on. Let's go.
Come on.

01:27:16.698 --> 01:27:18.188
The police'll be here soon.

01:27:39.087 --> 01:27:41.817
What did the bastard say?

01:27:41.923 --> 01:27:43.823
Didn't talk.

01:27:43.925 --> 01:27:46.485
Well, why didn't you make him?
That's what you went in there for!

01:27:52.267 --> 01:27:56.328
-Uh, David--
-Why don't you just go make some coffee?

01:27:59.374 --> 01:28:01.706
I want that Niles.!
I'm goin'in.

01:28:08.483 --> 01:28:11.714
- Please, David. Stop them.
- Don't worry.

01:28:16.157 --> 01:28:19.217
Solid. They can't break in.

01:28:22.864 --> 01:28:25.298
I know how they feel.

01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:28.528
I'd feel the same way if it was
my kid that was missing.

01:28:31.873 --> 01:28:35.468
Amy, go to bed, huh? Go on.

01:28:35.576 --> 01:28:37.544
I can handle this.

01:28:41.382 --> 01:28:44.840
You give me that Niles!

01:28:44.952 --> 01:28:49.355
Hey! Hey, cut it out!

01:28:49.457 --> 01:28:53.985
Listen to me. If you don't stop now,
so help me God I'll press charges!

01:29:11.479 --> 01:29:14.346
Okay, you've had your fun.

01:29:14.449 --> 01:29:16.747
I'll give you one more chance.

01:29:16.851 --> 01:29:21.515
And if you don't clear out now,
there'll be real trouble. I mean it.

01:29:29.497 --> 01:29:33.399
- Chris.!
- Come on. They're gonna cooperate now.

01:29:33.534 --> 01:29:35.365
Just go on upstairs.
Don't worry.

01:29:35.470 --> 01:29:38.337
- Where are you going?
- I'm just gonna fix the window.

01:29:49.083 --> 01:29:52.541
- Do you think we ought to
clear off, Norman? - Why?

01:29:52.653 --> 01:29:56.020
We'll get that Niles.
I tell you we will.

01:29:56.124 --> 01:29:58.957
Well, why stop then?

01:30:02.196 --> 01:30:04.790
He's got no right to live,
an animal like that.

01:30:04.932 --> 01:30:06.957
Tom, I'll run 'round,
I'll slip in the window...

01:30:07.101 --> 01:30:09.160
and get that Niles out
quick as a flash.

01:30:09.270 --> 01:30:12.103
Uh, the rest of you, kick up a row.

01:30:17.011 --> 01:30:18.911
Hey.!

01:30:21.416 --> 01:30:23.850
What the hell is wrong
with you people?

01:30:23.951 --> 01:30:27.512
It's that snipe
we're after, Mr. Sumner.

01:30:27.622 --> 01:30:31.149
- I said stay down!
- I want the lavvy.

01:30:32.560 --> 01:30:34.494
Come on.

01:30:34.629 --> 01:30:36.722
Look, you stupid Yank.

01:30:36.864 --> 01:30:39.662
Let's have Niles
before someone gets hurt!

01:30:39.767 --> 01:30:42.167
Come on. Up you go.

01:30:44.372 --> 01:30:46.738
I've had to put up
with a lot in my time.

01:30:46.841 --> 01:30:48.934
You can't leave him in there.

01:30:49.043 --> 01:30:51.637
But I draw the line at this place.

01:30:51.746 --> 01:30:54.180
No.!

01:30:54.282 --> 01:30:57.308
I'll have an answer,
or I'll have blood!

01:30:57.418 --> 01:31:00.410
Where are you going?

01:31:00.521 --> 01:31:03.217
Give Niles to them.
That's what they want.

01:31:08.796 --> 01:31:11.560
They just want him.

01:31:17.839 --> 01:31:20.239
Give them Niles, David!

01:31:23.344 --> 01:31:27.007
- They'll beat him to death.
- I don't care.

01:31:27.114 --> 01:31:29.582
You send him out,
or your whole house will be--

01:31:29.684 --> 01:31:32.209
Get him out!

01:31:35.423 --> 01:31:37.823
You really don't care, do you?

01:31:38.960 --> 01:31:41.190
No, I don't.

01:31:41.329 --> 01:31:42.990
Cawsey.!

01:31:44.765 --> 01:31:48.667
Come here.!

01:31:48.769 --> 01:31:51.169
There's more whiskey
in the lorry.!

01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:56.168
No. I care.

01:31:58.246 --> 01:32:01.477
This is where I live.

01:32:01.582 --> 01:32:03.482
This is me.

01:32:04.819 --> 01:32:07.344
I will not allow violence
against this house.

01:32:13.728 --> 01:32:16.219
Don't worry.

01:32:16.364 --> 01:32:18.798
Go on upstairs.

01:32:18.933 --> 01:32:21.094
- Beautiful.!
- Please don't leave me.

01:32:21.202 --> 01:32:23.397
Just do as you're told.

01:32:30.845 --> 01:32:34.144
Get out of there!

01:32:34.248 --> 01:32:36.478
David? It's me, Major Scott.

01:32:44.225 --> 01:32:46.921
- Come on.
- Thank you.

01:32:47.061 --> 01:32:49.393
I see you finally got
through the enemy lines.

01:32:49.497 --> 01:32:51.727
Don't worry about that.
I'll tell them to clear off.

01:32:51.832 --> 01:32:53.595
Sorry I didn't get here earlier.

01:32:53.701 --> 01:32:56.363
Yeah, I am too.
They're breaking all my windows.

01:32:56.470 --> 01:32:59.030
David,Janice Hedden is missing.

01:32:59.140 --> 01:33:01.472
Tom is out of his mind with worry.
They're drunk out there.

01:33:01.576 --> 01:33:03.476
I know that,
but you're the law here.

01:33:03.578 --> 01:33:07.105
d Oh, where can he be d

01:33:11.886 --> 01:33:13.877
I don'tjust kill 'em,
you know. I breed 'em as well.

01:33:13.988 --> 01:33:17.480
I'll deal with them.

01:33:17.592 --> 01:33:20.789
- David!
- Lots more where they came from.

01:33:26.601 --> 01:33:30.002
Well, Tom,you're being
a bit stupid, aren't you?

01:33:30.137 --> 01:33:32.935
Chucking things through people's
windows. You ought to have more sense.

01:33:33.040 --> 01:33:36.134
You tell him I want that Niles
or I'll come in and get him!

01:33:36.243 --> 01:33:39.974
You give me that bloody gun and get
the hell out of here. That's an order.

01:33:40.081 --> 01:33:44.074
What about myJanice?
It weren't one of yours.

01:33:46.554 --> 01:33:49.114
- He took myJanice.
- Listen, Tom.

01:33:49.223 --> 01:33:51.691
We don't want any trouble
here, do we?

01:33:51.792 --> 01:33:56.729
There wouldn't have been any trouble
if you'd put Henry Niles away.

01:33:56.864 --> 01:33:59.264
You wanted to put my Emma
away soon enough!

01:33:59.367 --> 01:34:02.029
Damn you, Hedden.
Give me that gun.

01:34:02.136 --> 01:34:04.104
Damn you, Major.
Let go!

01:34:19.387 --> 01:34:21.355
- David!
- Bastards!

01:34:21.455 --> 01:34:23.355
Bastards.!

01:34:25.126 --> 01:34:27.754
You bastards!

01:34:33.367 --> 01:34:36.495
David, phone! Phone anybody!

01:34:36.604 --> 01:34:39.095
Please, phone somebody!
David!

01:34:41.342 --> 01:34:43.503
Phone!

01:34:48.616 --> 01:34:51.084
- No calls tonight.
- It's dead.

01:34:51.185 --> 01:34:53.585
Get the lights. Go on.

01:34:56.290 --> 01:34:59.282
I didn't reckon on nobody
gettin' killed, Norman.

01:34:59.427 --> 01:35:02.521
Yeah, well, that's too bad.
We're all in it now.

01:35:07.068 --> 01:35:10.060
- Accessories, we are.
- That's the law.

01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:16.032
Henry Niles!

01:35:26.454 --> 01:35:28.217
I'm gonna keep them
out of this house.

01:35:29.623 --> 01:35:31.488
Please! Listen to me!

01:35:31.592 --> 01:35:34.755
- Come on!
- Shut your mouth. Shut it.

01:35:34.895 --> 01:35:37.523
I can hold them off. Don't worry.
Someone will show up.

01:35:37.665 --> 01:35:40.634
- David!
- Cut it out!

01:35:40.768 --> 01:35:42.929
Like Major Scott?

01:35:47.374 --> 01:35:50.241
David, how are you
gonna keep them out?

01:35:50.344 --> 01:35:54.303
- I can keep them out.
- How? There are five men out there.

01:35:54.415 --> 01:35:58.681
- I know that.
- They have a gun!

01:35:58.786 --> 01:36:01.050
I know they have.

01:36:03.758 --> 01:36:06.955
- Honey, I know what I'm doing.
- Goddamn you, David!

01:36:07.094 --> 01:36:09.619
- If you don't give them Niles, I will!
- Oh, no, you don't.

01:36:13.901 --> 01:36:15.732
We're gonna blast your windows.!

01:36:15.836 --> 01:36:18.532
This is my affair.
The lights.

01:36:18.639 --> 01:36:20.607
Go upstairs and turn on
all the lights.

01:36:20.708 --> 01:36:24.303
They won't be able to see me,
but I'll be able to see them. Go ahead.

01:36:24.411 --> 01:36:26.470
No.

01:36:26.580 --> 01:36:28.980
No, I won't.

01:36:29.083 --> 01:36:30.983
Go.

01:36:31.085 --> 01:36:33.485
Goddamn you! Move!

01:36:36.590 --> 01:36:38.581
Move!

01:36:42.129 --> 01:36:45.030
Yee-hee-hee-hoo!

01:36:45.132 --> 01:36:48.067
Oh, he's running it
into the glass house.!

01:36:49.603 --> 01:36:51.798
Norman.!

01:36:51.906 --> 01:36:53.874
Charlie.! In the glass house.!

01:36:55.976 --> 01:36:59.002
What are you gonna do on your own?

01:37:00.147 --> 01:37:02.411
Do we have any rope? Huh?

01:37:02.516 --> 01:37:05.349
I'm talking to you.
Do we have any rope?

01:37:05.452 --> 01:37:07.443
No.

01:37:07.555 --> 01:37:09.682
I suggest...

01:37:09.790 --> 01:37:11.917
you get out of the way
of the windows.

01:37:12.026 --> 01:37:14.859
I also suggest that you turn
the rest of the lights on upstairs.

01:37:14.995 --> 01:37:17.862
- Do we have any wire?
- I told you, I won't help you.

01:37:17.965 --> 01:37:20.399
I see.

01:37:22.269 --> 01:37:24.533
Why don't you entertain Niles?

01:38:02.076 --> 01:38:04.044
Norman! Chris!

01:38:05.145 --> 01:38:07.477
Who is it?

01:38:08.616 --> 01:38:11.050
Where are ya?

01:38:11.151 --> 01:38:13.119
- Yaa-ha!
- Aah!

01:38:13.220 --> 01:38:15.950
Oh, I fell!

01:38:16.056 --> 01:38:17.956
You're damned right, ya jerk!

01:38:18.058 --> 01:38:20.185
I'll wrap this bike
'round your neck!

01:38:26.300 --> 01:38:28.393
- See ya at the bottom!
- Yee!

01:38:33.207 --> 01:38:36.802
Let me in the door.!
I want Niles.!

01:38:39.146 --> 01:38:41.580
David, they're everywhere.
What are we gonna do?

01:38:41.682 --> 01:38:45.118
- David! Aah!
- Amy.

01:38:45.219 --> 01:38:48.814
Amy. Amy.

01:38:48.923 --> 01:38:51.619
Open the door,
and let's have Niles.

01:38:53.027 --> 01:38:55.552
I won't let them hurt you.

01:38:55.696 --> 01:38:57.596
Please, love.

01:38:57.698 --> 01:39:00.189
Wait there.
I'm coming, Charlie.

01:39:04.271 --> 01:39:06.569
Wait. Wait, Tom.

01:39:07.775 --> 01:39:10.243
No, David!

01:39:12.313 --> 01:39:16.306
Easy, Tom. Come on, Tom! Wait a minute.

01:39:16.417 --> 01:39:18.408
Let me out, David!

01:39:21.055 --> 01:39:22.955
David, I'm sick of it.

01:39:25.793 --> 01:39:29.490
If you don't let them have
what they want, then I'm going.

01:39:31.231 --> 01:39:33.529
Let me go.

01:39:38.138 --> 01:39:40.606
Go. Go.

01:39:44.011 --> 01:39:45.911
Go on.

01:39:52.453 --> 01:39:55.547
No! Aah!

01:40:00.194 --> 01:40:02.526
Stay there and do
as you're told.

01:40:04.131 --> 01:40:07.623
If you don't,
I'll break your neck.

01:40:11.338 --> 01:40:14.068
You've got more cartridges, Tom.
Enough for all of them.!

01:40:14.174 --> 01:40:16.734
- It's just Niles.
- Listen--

01:40:16.844 --> 01:40:19.404
He can't shoot
through that door.

01:40:19.513 --> 01:40:21.413
Ya dirty Yank bastard.!

01:40:21.515 --> 01:40:23.915
Listen to me.

01:40:24.018 --> 01:40:27.920
You know what happens if they
get in now? They'll kill us all.

01:40:33.627 --> 01:40:36.994
They've gone too far
to back down now.

01:40:37.097 --> 01:40:40.032
You understand that?

01:40:40.167 --> 01:40:43.500
We're dead if they get in.

01:40:43.604 --> 01:40:47.335
Thank you, sweetheart. Stay.

01:40:51.278 --> 01:40:53.246
- Cawsey, come here.!
- Where are ya?

01:40:53.347 --> 01:40:54.575
- Cawsey, come here.!
- Where are ya?

01:40:55.783 --> 01:40:59.082
- Can you get in?
- Yeah, I think so.

01:40:59.186 --> 01:41:02.587
They'll be hiding from the gun.
Get in and slip along and open the door.

01:41:02.689 --> 01:41:05.817
Hey. Make bloody sure
Tom don't fire at me.

01:41:05.926 --> 01:41:08.895
He won't. I'll be there.

01:41:09.029 --> 01:41:12.328
Mrs. Sumner, I've got
something for you here. Look.

01:41:12.433 --> 01:41:15.300
Aah!

01:41:15.402 --> 01:41:18.235
See him down there?

01:41:18.338 --> 01:41:20.806
- Get out! Get out!
- Aah.! Hee hee.!

01:41:31.418 --> 01:41:33.283
Let go.

01:41:35.722 --> 01:41:39.453
Make one move, you son of a bitch,
and I'll slit your throat.

01:41:39.593 --> 01:41:42.824
Give me your other hand.

01:41:42.963 --> 01:41:44.863
Come on.

01:41:54.374 --> 01:41:57.673
This wasn't any of my doing, sir.
It was Venner and Hedden.

01:41:57.778 --> 01:42:00.303
Been after your wife,yes.

01:42:00.414 --> 01:42:02.245
Am I hurting you, Mr. Scutt?

01:42:02.349 --> 01:42:04.817
- My neck's on the glass.
- Good.

01:42:04.918 --> 01:42:07.580
Hope you slit your throat.

01:42:11.558 --> 01:42:14.789
Come out here.!

01:42:14.928 --> 01:42:17.419
Amy, come here.

01:42:20.834 --> 01:42:23.496
Get me out ofhere.!

01:42:24.805 --> 01:42:26.636
Tom.!

01:42:28.775 --> 01:42:31.835
- Wait. Fine.
- Watch my head.

01:42:35.249 --> 01:42:37.649
Hold it still.
That's it.

01:42:39.686 --> 01:42:41.586
Get upstairs.

01:42:48.662 --> 01:42:50.823
There we are.

01:43:01.108 --> 01:43:04.134
David.! David.! No.!

01:43:04.244 --> 01:43:07.509
David.! David.! No.!

01:43:07.614 --> 01:43:09.912
No! Aah!

01:43:10.017 --> 01:43:13.316
David! No! Aah!

01:43:19.059 --> 01:43:22.222
Open the attic door. Come on.

01:43:22.362 --> 01:43:24.296
Come on.

01:43:35.842 --> 01:43:37.776
Tom!

01:43:47.854 --> 01:43:51.381
Open the door,
or I'll blow you to pieces.!

01:43:51.491 --> 01:43:56.588

01:43:56.730 --> 01:44:00.222
Where is he?
I can't see him.

01:44:00.367 --> 01:44:02.267
Open the door.!

01:45:56.850 --> 01:45:58.715
He's playing music.

01:46:21.108 --> 01:46:23.042
- Give me the gun.
- Out of the way. I'm goin' in.

01:46:27.047 --> 01:46:30.380
Keep the gun pointed,
and he won't get near you.

01:46:36.556 --> 01:46:39.047
I've got ya, Tom!

01:46:41.495 --> 01:46:44.259

01:46:58.412 --> 01:47:01.609
Don't come in.
You don't come in here.

01:47:23.203 --> 01:47:25.103
Evenin', Mr. Sumner.

01:48:20.093 --> 01:48:22.027
Gun's empty.

01:48:24.297 --> 01:48:27.164

01:48:28.969 --> 01:48:31.335
Why don't you pull it

Take him downstairs, Charlie.

01:49:35.302 --> 01:49:37.862
Just do it, Charlie.

01:50:22.248 --> 01:50:24.307
No, Charlie!

01:51:51.071 --> 01:51:52.971
Jesus.
