00:47.776 --> 00:49.776
Laurien?

00:49.816 --> 00:52.536
Laurence. It's already light.
We must have fallen asleep.

01:01.736 --> 01:03.736
Go. Before the rest of the house
wakes up.

01:09.616 --> 01:11.696
Got a meeting with my lawyers
this morning.

01:11.736 --> 01:14.856
Maybe they can persuade the press
to see reason.

01:14.896 --> 01:18.536
I can't believe they still won't
print your side of the story.

01:18.576 --> 01:22.616
Well, why would they be interested in
the truth when their lies sell more papers?

01:22.656 --> 01:25.576
It's my female costumers who are
deserting me because of it.

01:25.616 --> 01:27.936
I need to find some way
of bringing them back.

01:27.976 --> 01:32.136
You know, I've asked Delphine
to come in and discuss strategy
at the store today.

01:32.176 --> 01:35.816
I'd love for you to be there too.
Are you sure you can't join us, Rose?

01:35.856 --> 01:39.896
I'm sorry, Harry.
I'd really love to help, but...
I have an appointment this morning.

01:39.936 --> 01:42.776
Then I suppose I'll just have to
struggle on alone!

01:43.776 --> 01:47.016
But if you want my advice,
I'd just keep things simple.

01:47.056 --> 01:50.456
In times of trouble, people
need something they can depend on.

01:51.656 --> 01:53.776
Well, I'll be...
What is it?

01:53.816 --> 01:55.816
Here.

01:55.856 --> 01:57.856
Town Talk.

01:57.896 --> 02:00.496
They're saying
that Mae has left Loxley.

02:11.176 --> 02:13.176
Good morning, Miss.
Good morning.

02:22.096 --> 02:24.096
All for you, as usual.

02:25.536 --> 02:27.536
There may still yet be word
from George.

02:28.896 --> 02:30.896
Missing does not mean he's...

02:32.336 --> 02:34.536
I's been less than three weeks,
my dear.

02:34.576 --> 02:37.256
We mustn't give up hope.

02:39.016 --> 02:41.016
Well?
Still dripping.

02:41.056 --> 02:43.416
But now at least I think I know why.

02:44.416 --> 02:46.856
It's so nice to have
a gentleman around the house.

02:52.376 --> 02:54.656
I still have my reservations
about seeing Mae.

02:54.696 --> 02:58.056
She just walked out on Loxley, Harry.
Doesn't that strike you as strange?

02:58.096 --> 03:00.336
Why should I trust her again
after what she did?

03:00.376 --> 03:02.376
But what if there's more to it?

03:02.416 --> 03:05.856
I felt as betrayed as you. But what
she did seemed out of character.

03:05.896 --> 03:08.456
And she's been such a loyal friend
to us in the past.

03:09.456 --> 03:13.736
I'll see her, but you know
how I feel about this. Just hear
what she has to say. Please?

03:17.096 --> 03:20.616
I still think that working in
a factory is a waste of your talents.

03:20.656 --> 03:23.216
If it aids the war effort,
I'm happy to do it.

03:23.256 --> 03:25.256
Music can wait.

03:25.296 --> 03:28.856
Well, if you're going to sweat and strain
all day, at least eat a decent lunch.

03:28.896 --> 03:32.456
They pay me a fare wage, Josie.
I have money.

03:32.496 --> 03:34.496
Here. Please. Take it.

03:36.296 --> 03:38.296
Thank you.

03:40.376 --> 03:42.376
No!

04:01.936 --> 04:03.936
Well, I'm not giving this
to Mr Grove.

04:03.976 --> 04:06.056
I don't want to resign, Miss Hawkins.

04:06.096 --> 04:08.976
I love it here.
But my father's insisting.

04:09.016 --> 04:11.176
He says he won't have me
working here no more.

04:11.216 --> 04:13.296
That Mr Selfridge
is a friend of The Kaiser.

04:13.336 --> 04:17.696
Oh, stuff and nonsense! If there's a bigger
patriot in this store, I'll eat my hat.

04:17.736 --> 04:20.776
But what with the papers and all -
You don't want to believe

04:20.815 --> 04:23.336
everything you read -
and neither does your father.

04:23.376 --> 04:25.976
Well, what should I do?

04:28.456 --> 04:30.456
Tell him you've
given the letter to me...

04:30.496 --> 04:33.016
and that you've got to work
a week's notice.

04:33.056 --> 04:35.856
Then what?
You leave that to me.

04:37.656 --> 04:39.656
The scandal is still hurting us.

04:39.696 --> 04:44.936
Only this week, seven more
influential female customers have
closed their accounts.

04:44.976 --> 04:48.216
We must act now. We need to make this
store the talk of the town again.

04:48.256 --> 04:51.056
But for all the right reasons.
Delphine's is on the up

04:51.096 --> 04:53.736
because we offer people an escape.

04:53.776 --> 04:56.976
Let's entertain them, Harry.
Just like you've always done.

04:57.016 --> 04:59.496
What exactly did you have in mind?

04:59.536 --> 05:02.816
We bring the spirit of Delphine's
to Selfridge's.

05:02.856 --> 05:05.296
We recreate the club
in the Palm Court.

05:05.336 --> 05:08.856
Give me 24 hours and I will
fill the place to the rafters.

05:08.896 --> 05:12.256
If you get the right people in,
then the rest will follow.

05:12.296 --> 05:17.296
Let us hope so. Although, Selfridge's is
a rather different beast to a... nightclub.

05:18.616 --> 05:20.816
Well, I think it's a great idea.

05:20.856 --> 05:23.056
Thank you.

05:23.096 --> 05:25.456
I have another proposal
which may aid us.

05:25.496 --> 05:28.856
I've heard Winifred Bonfils Black
is in London. The journalist?

05:28.896 --> 05:31.456
I met her a few times in New York.

05:31.496 --> 05:33.736
Her articles
are syndicated everywhere.

05:34.736 --> 05:37.616
She'd be the perfect person
to write about our new promotion.

05:37.656 --> 05:39.656
Winifred's... She's a one off.

05:39.696 --> 05:42.656
If by that you mean she's trouble,
then I'd be forced to agree.

05:42.696 --> 05:45.416
We would have a tiger by the tail.

05:45.456 --> 05:47.936
But when she speaks, women listen.

05:47.976 --> 05:50.216
Which is exactly why it is
such a risk.

05:50.256 --> 05:52.256
But one we have to take.

05:52.296 --> 05:54.296
I have faith in my store.

05:54.336 --> 05:57.536
Henri, invite her to lunch.
If you can't charm her, no-one can.

05:57.576 --> 05:59.576
Thank you all very much.

06:40.296 --> 06:43.856
Kitty.
I was surprised to get your call.

06:43.896 --> 06:45.896
Have you read this?

06:48.096 --> 06:52.576
'Rumours of a separation between
Lord and Lady Loxley continue.'

06:52.616 --> 06:56.016
And what of it?
Well, why would she leave him?

06:56.056 --> 06:58.416
We've all met the man.
Yes, but why now?

06:58.456 --> 07:00.576
Just as the scandal breaks out.

07:00.616 --> 07:05.096
Maybe she's telling the world that
Loxley's to blame for all of this.

07:05.136 --> 07:07.136
Or maybe it's just a coincidence.

07:08.176 --> 07:10.096
Well, I hope you're going to
look into it.

07:10.136 --> 07:12.616
Miss Pertree
handed in her notice today.

07:12.656 --> 07:16.776
Her father read your article and insisted she
leave the store. I'm sorry to hear that.

07:23.336 --> 07:25.336
It's a matter of integrity.

07:26.336 --> 07:29.416
If Loxley's behind this,
then you need to prove it.

07:29.456 --> 07:32.496
Put the truth out there in black
and white so everyone can see it.

07:32.536 --> 07:34.536
It's not that simple, Kitty.

07:37.336 --> 07:40.216
You owe it to Mr Selfridge
to put this right.

07:42.736 --> 07:46.296
Come on, Jameson, think about it.
Loxley rang me with the story.

07:46.336 --> 07:49.336
What if he planned all this
to divert attention from himself?

07:49.376 --> 07:52.616
If he's manipulating both of us, we
have an obligation to investigate.

07:52.656 --> 07:55.296
Taking on Harry Selfridge
is one thing.

07:55.336 --> 07:59.776
Attacking the government? I may be
mad, Frank, but I'm not crazy.

07:59.816 --> 08:01.816
You know, I thought you'd say that.

08:01.856 --> 08:03.856
Which is why I brought you this.

08:04.856 --> 08:06.536
I'm resigning from my column.

08:08.016 --> 08:10.336
If I can't write the truth,
I won't write at all.

08:17.896 --> 08:20.496
I'll see if he's available.
One moment, please.

08:20.536 --> 08:23.816
I'm sorry, Mr Selfridge.
Frank Edwards is on the telephone.

08:23.856 --> 08:27.016
I have nothing to say to him.
Please tell him not to call again.

08:27.056 --> 08:29.056
Very good, Mr Selfridge.

08:31.376 --> 08:33.816
We'll start with the large pieces
over here.

08:33.856 --> 08:35.856
Frame this space.

08:35.895 --> 08:38.696
I thought you should know
what was being planned.

08:40.655 --> 08:43.535
Well, it's different,
I've gotta say that. Mm.

08:43.576 --> 08:45.336
This your idea?

08:46.376 --> 08:49.656
Direct from Mr Selfridge.
And... and Miss Day, of course.

08:49.696 --> 08:53.336
'Bring the spirit of Delphine's
to the Palm Court.'

08:53.376 --> 08:55.976
An... Arabian theme, I understand.

08:56.976 --> 09:00.136
Well, as long as they don't expect
Franco to do a belly dance...

09:01.656 --> 09:05.296
No word from your George?
Not yet.

09:07.256 --> 09:11.536
I...I should get back. There's a...
a new window to finish for tomorrow.

09:11.576 --> 09:13.696
Monsieur Leclair promised me
some advice.

09:18.776 --> 09:20.816
And how long have you
had these symptoms?

09:21.856 --> 09:24.136
Say three or four months.
Perhaps more.

09:25.136 --> 09:27.136
And the difficulty in breathing?

09:27.176 --> 09:29.656
Uh, the same.

09:29.696 --> 09:32.336
I'm sure I'm wasting
your valuable time, Doctor.

09:32.376 --> 09:35.736
It's just, the last few weeks,
I've had so little energy.

09:36.936 --> 09:40.336
I thought some kind of tonic...
would help.

09:41.496 --> 09:43.696
Perhaps so. But first...

09:43.736 --> 09:45.896
I should like to examine you.

09:45.936 --> 09:48.536
If you've no objections.
Of course.

09:48.576 --> 09:50.856
Come.

09:53.696 --> 09:56.056
You wanted to see me?
Please sit down.

10:14.296 --> 10:18.816
What I witnessed this morning was
unbecoming of an employee of Selfridge's.

10:18.856 --> 10:20.856
And frankly, embarrassing.

10:20.896 --> 10:23.736
This 'affair...' has gone too far.

10:23.776 --> 10:27.016
I have done my utmost to persuade
you to end it in a dignified fashion,

10:27.056 --> 10:29.536
but you seem determined
to ignore me.

10:29.576 --> 10:31.576
As a result,

10:31.616 --> 10:33.616
you have been humiliated.

10:33.656 --> 10:36.896
I had hoped you would come to
realise that financial gain

10:36.936 --> 10:39.456
is the most likely motive
for this boy's...

10:39.496 --> 10:42.016
apparent... infatuation.

10:43.056 --> 10:45.296
That is a despicable suggestion.

10:45.336 --> 10:49.576
And yet, this morning, I saw him
receiving money from you
with my own eyes.

10:49.616 --> 10:51.616
Could it be any clearer?

10:51.656 --> 10:55.536
You're being taken for a fool,
Miss Mardle. An old fool.

10:58.736 --> 11:00.816
If you've quite finished,
then I'll reply.

11:00.856 --> 11:03.576
My life is my own, Mr Grove.

11:03.616 --> 11:05.816
How I choose to live it
is my business.

11:07.016 --> 11:09.016
And I would ask you, in future,

11:09.056 --> 11:11.056
to keep both your opinions...

11:11.096 --> 11:12.896
and your insults...

11:12.936 --> 11:14.896
to yourself.

11:42.116 --> 11:44.916
One Manhattan, Madame.
And I should charge this to...?

11:44.956 --> 11:46.956
Harry Selfridge, of course.

11:47.956 --> 11:49.956
Winifred Black.

11:49.996 --> 11:51.796
Thank you so much
for coming to see me.

11:51.836 --> 11:53.916
The pleasure is all yours.

11:54.916 --> 11:56.916
And Monsieur Leclair.

11:56.956 --> 11:58.836
It's been too long.

12:00.076 --> 12:02.076
Miss Black.

12:02.116 --> 12:05.316
I got your message, practically
insisting I pay you a visit.

12:05.356 --> 12:07.676
Which made me think
you want something from me.

12:07.716 --> 12:12.356
Am I that transparent? Oh, I find
that men usually are. It's one of
life's constant disappointments.

12:13.396 --> 12:16.916
I see that my Fleet Street colleagues
have been giving you a rough ride.

12:16.956 --> 12:19.716
Damn lies.
But mud sticks.

12:19.756 --> 12:21.756
We need some good publicity.

12:21.796 --> 12:24.356
An article by you would be
a fantastic start.

12:24.396 --> 12:26.396
I don't do puff pieces.

12:26.436 --> 12:31.156
My readers rely on me
for the unvarnished truth.
Which is what we want you to write.

12:31.196 --> 12:34.196
You have integrity and so do I.
And I am confident

12:34.236 --> 12:36.236
that my store will speak for itself.

12:36.276 --> 12:39.116
Monsieur Leclair will give you
all the access you need.

12:41.116 --> 12:43.116
Here's how it works.

12:43.156 --> 12:45.156
You give me carte blanche

12:45.196 --> 12:47.556
to look around
and talk to your staff.

12:47.596 --> 12:51.476
I find a story that inspires me...
maybe I'll write it.

12:53.956 --> 12:55.956
It's a deal.

12:55.996 --> 12:58.356
Let's hope you don't
live to regret it.

12:58.396 --> 13:00.316
Hm.

13:01.356 --> 13:03.356
It was brave of you to leave him.

13:07.076 --> 13:09.076
I couldn't live with him
a moment longer.

13:10.836 --> 13:13.276
Anyway, I'm very glad
that you called, Mr Edwards.

13:13.316 --> 13:15.316
I presume this is about
Harry Selfridge.

13:15.356 --> 13:17.756
I wanna get to the bottom of
the wretched business.

13:17.796 --> 13:19.796
But Harry won't take my calls.

13:19.836 --> 13:22.076
It's understandable, I suppose.

13:22.116 --> 13:26.436
And there's no point in a direct approach
to the committee. They'll only close ranks.

13:26.476 --> 13:29.356
Well, then, perhaps we should
find the weakest link.

13:33.036 --> 13:36.516
Lord Edgerton and Loxley...
they were at school together.

13:37.916 --> 13:41.116
Now, Miles had certain...
peccadilloes even then.

13:41.156 --> 13:44.356
And... let's just say
he's never grown out of them.

13:44.396 --> 13:48.716
What are you saying? I overheard
Loxley blackmail Edgerton...

13:48.756 --> 13:50.996
for a seat on
the Procurement Committee.

13:52.396 --> 13:55.916
This was all planned, Mr Edwards.
Right from the very start.

13:55.956 --> 13:58.156
And now Harry's
taking the rap for it?

13:58.196 --> 14:00.196
Exactly.

14:00.236 --> 14:03.236
And if he won't help himself,
then we must do it for him.

14:05.716 --> 14:08.276
And this is our fashion department.
A-ha!

14:08.316 --> 14:10.876
And indeed our Head of Fashion,
Mr Thackeray.

14:10.916 --> 14:15.356
Mr Thackeray? May I introduce
Winifred Black? She's a journalist.

14:16.876 --> 14:18.876
Bien sur!

14:18.916 --> 14:20.716
Your reputation precedes you.

14:20.756 --> 14:23.316
Mrs Black is writing
about the store.

14:23.356 --> 14:25.396
You know I'm one of your
greatest admirers?

14:26.676 --> 14:31.036
As I'm sure Monsieur Leclair has
told you, female fashion is at
the very heart of this store.

14:31.076 --> 14:34.196
I flatter myself that where our
department leads the others follow.

14:34.236 --> 14:36.236
I could show you around personally.

14:36.276 --> 14:38.276
Very kind. But...

14:38.316 --> 14:40.316
I like to find my own way.

14:40.356 --> 14:43.196
It's the only way to get under
the skin of a place. Of course.

14:43.236 --> 14:45.236
You have your particular methods.

14:45.276 --> 14:48.556
But if you need anything...
you simply have to ask.

14:48.596 --> 14:50.596
Noted. Thank you.

14:50.636 --> 14:53.076
And it's Thackeray - with an A-Y.

14:53.116 --> 14:55.196
A common error, sadly.

14:58.356 --> 15:02.756
Well. There's a man who'd sell his
own grandmother for a quarter and a smile.

15:02.796 --> 15:06.436
So you know him already.
Am I wrong?

15:13.236 --> 15:16.716
Oh. Delphine. I didn't expect
to see you at the store today.

15:16.756 --> 15:19.116
I just need to talk to Harry
about something.

15:19.156 --> 15:22.236
Oh, I think he's left. I saw him
walk out a few minutes ago.

15:22.276 --> 15:24.276
Oh.

15:24.316 --> 15:26.516
Well, I'm sure I'll catch him
at home tonight.

15:26.556 --> 15:28.996
I should probably -
No, don't go.

15:29.036 --> 15:31.276
I feel like we haven't talked
in a long time.

15:32.356 --> 15:34.716
My ladies want a story
they can identify with.

15:34.756 --> 15:37.156
Something... inspirational.

15:37.196 --> 15:39.316
Then perhaps you should
meet Miss Towler.

15:45.156 --> 15:48.236
If I didn't know any better,
I'd say you were avoiding me.

15:48.276 --> 15:50.836
I was hoping to see you
at our film night. It's...

15:50.876 --> 15:54.316
really nothing personal. I've just
been a little tired. That's all.

15:55.356 --> 15:57.196
You do look rather pale, Rose.

15:58.876 --> 16:01.956
Are you sure you're quite well?
Oh, it's nothing.

16:01.996 --> 16:04.916
My doctor just diagnosed me
with a little um...

16:05.916 --> 16:08.156
..congestion on my chest.

16:08.196 --> 16:10.356
I'm sure it's all down to
the city smog.

16:10.396 --> 16:13.796
Oh, dear. Does Harry know?

16:13.836 --> 16:15.836
Not yet, no.

16:15.876 --> 16:19.476
It didn't... seem fair to burden him
with... my troubles too.

16:19.516 --> 16:21.516
You're probably right.

16:21.556 --> 16:24.116
He doesn't need anything else
to worry about.

16:25.116 --> 16:27.836
You should have seen him this
morning. He looked like he had

16:27.876 --> 16:30.516
the weight of the world
on his shoulders.

16:30.556 --> 16:32.556
What you need, Rose...

16:32.596 --> 16:34.596
is a break.

16:34.636 --> 16:36.676
You need to take some time
in the country

16:36.716 --> 16:38.716
and get your strength back.

16:46.356 --> 16:48.636
So the story's true.
You left Loxley.

16:48.676 --> 16:51.276
Something I should've done
a long time ago.

16:53.596 --> 16:55.596
Rats desert sinking ships.

16:58.116 --> 17:00.356
I should not have
vouched for Loxley.

17:00.396 --> 17:03.236
And I should've spoken up
when I first suspected.

17:03.276 --> 17:07.316
But you chose not to. Choice
has very little to do with it.

17:08.756 --> 17:10.756
When I married Loxley,

17:10.796 --> 17:14.236
I knew he had few scruples,
but I thought I could control him.

17:14.276 --> 17:16.476
Being married to
such a powerful man,

17:16.516 --> 17:18.435
that was intoxicating.

17:18.476 --> 17:22.236
But I was just...
I was a naive young girl.

17:22.276 --> 17:24.596
Why did you vouch for him?

17:31.836 --> 17:33.836
Loxley is...

17:35.676 --> 17:37.676
..a violent man.

17:41.236 --> 17:44.876
Why didn't you say something?
Because I was ashamed.

17:45.916 --> 17:47.916
I am ashamed.

17:49.156 --> 17:51.596
And scared. We have to stop him.

17:51.636 --> 17:54.316
I believe he means you harm.

17:54.356 --> 17:58.236
And... you don't know
what else he's capable of.

17:58.276 --> 18:00.276
I'm beginning to understand.

18:02.036 --> 18:04.036
It's not safe for you here.

18:04.076 --> 18:06.116
You're to come home with me.

18:06.156 --> 18:08.676
And stay as long as you need to.

18:08.716 --> 18:11.756
These are exquisite!

18:11.796 --> 18:15.476
How long have you worked here?
Since the first day that we opened.

18:15.516 --> 18:19.356
I erm... had to leave my previous
post. There was a misunderstanding.

18:20.396 --> 18:23.276
Actually, I suppose it was...
it was Mr Selfridge's fault.

18:23.316 --> 18:26.396
So I... went to his house
and asked for a job.

18:28.476 --> 18:30.636
You just marched right in there?

18:30.676 --> 18:33.156
I can't believe I actually did it,
but...

18:34.196 --> 18:38.076
Well, you are clearly a young woman
who makes her own fortune.

18:38.116 --> 18:41.276
I work hard, but it was erm...
it was Monsieur Leclair

18:41.316 --> 18:43.316
who taught me everything I know.

18:43.356 --> 18:45.436
A-ha. The protege.

18:46.676 --> 18:48.836
With the help of Mr Selfridge,
of course.

18:48.876 --> 18:50.916
He was the one who
sent Miss Towler to Paris.

18:50.956 --> 18:53.636
I expect that little trip
opened your eyes.

18:53.676 --> 18:55.676
Oh, it did.

18:55.716 --> 18:59.556
The Moulin Rouge - quite shocking. But
I wouldn't have missed it for the world.

18:59.596 --> 19:02.396
Miss Towler always had
a natural talent.

19:03.876 --> 19:05.956
It just needed to blossom.

19:05.996 --> 19:08.436
I imagine you two make quite a team.

19:12.996 --> 19:14.996
What is your article about?

19:15.036 --> 19:17.756
Oh, I have no earthly idea
what it's about.

19:17.796 --> 19:20.756
But I find that, if you
look hard enough at something...

19:20.796 --> 19:22.916
a story usually appears.

19:22.956 --> 19:25.156
You're getting married.

19:25.196 --> 19:27.556
Oh. Erm... to Victor.

19:27.596 --> 19:29.596
He manages the Palm Court.

19:30.636 --> 19:33.756
Harry Selfridge -
employer and matchmaker.

19:36.076 --> 19:38.116
Your parents must be very proud.

19:38.156 --> 19:40.156
Oh, it's just me
and my brother George.

19:40.196 --> 19:42.716
It's um... always just been
the two of us, really.

19:42.756 --> 19:44.636
Is he fighting?

19:44.676 --> 19:46.796
He's missing in action.

19:46.836 --> 19:50.476
Oh.
But... I'm sure he'll be back.

19:54.596 --> 19:57.036
Excuse me.
Mr Colleano.

19:57.076 --> 20:00.716
I...I wanted to talk to you
about Miss Towler.

20:01.716 --> 20:03.716
There is still no word
from her brother?

20:03.756 --> 20:06.516
Nothing. After three weeks.

20:06.556 --> 20:10.196
I'm concerned that she's convincing
herself he's still alive.

20:10.236 --> 20:13.036
Well, maybe it's her way
of dealing with it.

20:13.076 --> 20:15.116
Her way of getting through it.

20:17.636 --> 20:19.636
You know her best.

20:21.956 --> 20:25.956
If you've got something to say,
Mr Leclair... say it my face.

20:25.996 --> 20:27.836
I'm not gonna fight you.

20:28.836 --> 20:30.716
Now, you listen to me!

20:32.356 --> 20:34.596
I've been there for Agnes
right through this.

20:34.636 --> 20:36.636
Day and night.

20:36.676 --> 20:38.676
I'm offering her more than
you ever have.

20:38.716 --> 20:42.876
A family, a future, something real,
something she can hold onto.

21:00.667 --> 21:03.387
You wanted to see me, Mr Selfridge?
Ah. Miss Plunkett.

21:03.427 --> 21:06.827
You should know that my family will
be arriving from the States soon.

21:06.867 --> 21:10.107
I'm afraid it's gonna require
a little more work on your part.

21:10.147 --> 21:13.387
My girls can be... rather demanding.

21:13.427 --> 21:15.747
I see.

21:15.787 --> 21:19.107
I hope that won't be a problem. My
previous secretary, Miss Blenkinsop,

21:19.147 --> 21:22.147
always managed to
wrangle them somehow. Well.

21:23.187 --> 21:25.187
I'm sure I'll be able to cope,
Mr Selfridge.

21:29.627 --> 21:33.427
Miss Plunkett, meet Miss Blenkinsop,
my former secretary and your new colleague.

21:33.467 --> 21:37.187
Miss Blenkinsop had to leave for personal
reasons, but she's now going to be rej-

21:37.227 --> 21:39.547
Am I being replaced?

21:39.587 --> 21:41.787
Not replaced. Assisted.

21:41.827 --> 21:44.547
Miss Blenkinsop will be
my new social secretary.

21:44.587 --> 21:46.907
And you'll deal with
all the store business.

21:47.907 --> 21:51.227
I'm sure we can find a way
to work together.

21:59.467 --> 22:02.827
Oh, Mae. You know, I sensed
something was wrong weeks ago.

22:02.867 --> 22:04.867
You weren't yourself. But...

22:04.907 --> 22:07.747
I was so distracted with everything
that was going on - No, no.

22:07.787 --> 22:11.027
I thought that I could deal
with Loxley alone. I was wrong.

22:11.067 --> 22:13.827
Well, you're here now.
You and Pimble.

22:13.867 --> 22:15.667
Safe and sound.

22:15.707 --> 22:18.427
I only wish I was going to be able
to spend more time with you.

22:19.427 --> 22:23.027
Are you leaving?
Once the girls are settled, yes.

22:23.067 --> 22:25.667
I'm planning on spending
a few weeks on the coast.

22:29.467 --> 22:31.467
Is everything all right?

22:31.507 --> 22:33.507
Fine.

22:34.987 --> 22:37.827
I went to see the doctor today.
Just a...

22:37.867 --> 22:40.787
mild congestion of the lungs,
but Delphine suggested

22:40.827 --> 22:44.107
that it would do me the world of good
to get out of the city for a while.

22:46.067 --> 22:48.067
Are you sure about this, Rose?

22:48.107 --> 22:51.347
You'd... you'd be leaving Harry at
a time when he needs your support

22:51.387 --> 22:53.387
more than ever.

22:54.427 --> 22:56.347
I really don't wanna
be a burden to Harry.

22:57.387 --> 22:59.427
No, I think Delphine's right.

22:59.467 --> 23:01.707
It just wouldn't be fair.

23:03.347 --> 23:06.707
You've done a great job. Well,
we're a fantastic team, Harry.

23:06.747 --> 23:10.187
Mm.
And you are a fascinating man.

23:11.187 --> 23:14.587
People might think you do this
for the money, but I don't think so at all.

23:14.627 --> 23:16.627
And what is my motivation?

23:16.667 --> 23:20.347
You love to give people what they want.
Even if they don't know it themselves.

23:20.387 --> 23:22.947
We're the same, you and I.

23:22.987 --> 23:26.067
Which is why all this
doesn't have to stop now.

23:26.107 --> 23:28.987
With all due respect
to Monsieur Leclair, I believe

23:29.027 --> 23:32.027
what you need is a female vision
across the whole store.

23:33.027 --> 23:35.467
Not just for a couple of days.

23:35.507 --> 23:37.707
I find my wife does that very well.

23:37.747 --> 23:39.827
But perhaps you
have someone in mind!

23:39.867 --> 23:44.227
Trust me, Harry. We should work
together, you and I, side by side.

23:44.267 --> 23:46.707
You won't regret it.

24:17.147 --> 24:19.627
Oh. Sorry.

24:25.587 --> 24:27.587
For... for a moment,

24:27.627 --> 24:29.627
I really thought it was him.

24:29.667 --> 24:31.667
I thought... it was George. And...

24:31.707 --> 24:33.987
And then he turned.

24:35.387 --> 24:38.667
What... what will I do, Victor?
What will I do if he's gone?

24:41.587 --> 24:43.587
Now, you listen to me.

24:43.627 --> 24:45.627
Whatever the truth,

24:45.667 --> 24:47.667
whatever happens,

24:47.707 --> 24:49.867
we're gonna face it together,
you and me.

24:50.867 --> 24:52.867
Side by side.

24:52.907 --> 24:54.907
Man and wife.

24:58.147 --> 25:00.147
Come here.

25:00.187 --> 25:03.027
You need your family around you
at times like this.

25:05.187 --> 25:07.187
It's late.

25:08.507 --> 25:10.507
You need to eat.

25:12.427 --> 25:14.427
I'll cook us an Uncle Joe Special.

25:16.747 --> 25:18.747
Come on. Let's go.

25:19.747 --> 25:23.387
I can't. I've got my um...
I've got my window to finish.

25:24.427 --> 25:26.427
All right.

25:28.387 --> 25:31.747
But if you're not back at
Miss Mardle's in the next couple of hours,

25:31.787 --> 25:34.347
I'll drag you out of here myself.

25:53.907 --> 25:57.667
Lord Edgerton, I have it on good authority
that you were blackmailed by Loxley.

25:57.707 --> 26:01.387
Me, blackmailed?
That is an outrageous suggestion.

26:01.427 --> 26:03.827
My information comes from
an impeccable source.

26:07.507 --> 26:09.747
What do you want from me,
Mr Edwards?

26:09.787 --> 26:11.987
Your co-operation.

26:12.027 --> 26:14.867
Give me the evidence I need
to bring Loxley down.

26:15.907 --> 26:18.027
I want him behind bars,
where he belongs.

26:20.107 --> 26:22.267
If Edgerton admits
to being blackmailed,

26:22.307 --> 26:24.347
Loxley will be thoroughly discredited

26:24.387 --> 26:26.867
and Harry will be in the clear.

26:26.907 --> 26:28.907
The truth must come out.

26:28.947 --> 26:30.907
And it's down to you, Miss Hawkins.

26:32.867 --> 26:36.227
Well, I'm glad to be of service,
I'm sure. What about Miss Pertree?

26:36.267 --> 26:38.747
I just need a few more days.

26:38.787 --> 26:40.747
Which she doesn't have.

26:40.787 --> 26:43.747
So, as usual, I'll just
have to deal with it myself.

26:53.707 --> 26:56.627
Oh! Goodness. You startled me.

26:57.667 --> 26:59.667
I'm impressed.

26:59.707 --> 27:01.747
It's everything
you said it would be.

27:01.787 --> 27:04.227
Oh, it's not even nearly finished.

27:05.227 --> 27:07.747
Art... is never finished.

27:07.787 --> 27:12.067
Merely abandoned. On which subject,
I'm here to say goodbye.

27:12.107 --> 27:14.107
Oh, you're... you're leaving?
Mm-hm.

27:14.147 --> 27:16.867
There's nothing like a deadline
to sharpen the mind.

27:16.907 --> 27:20.507
Speaking of which,
when is your wedding?

27:22.107 --> 27:24.547
Erm... we haven't set a date yet.

27:24.587 --> 27:27.227
I must say, I'm surprised
you would give this all up.

27:27.267 --> 27:29.307
After you've worked so hard for it.

27:30.547 --> 27:32.947
If you met Victor,
you might think differently.

27:34.427 --> 27:38.187
I've been down the aisle twice. Both
times, it was my dream come true.

27:40.267 --> 27:42.267
Victor is offering me...

27:42.307 --> 27:45.427
a home and a family,
which is all I've ever wanted.

27:46.467 --> 27:48.467
And yet, here you are,

27:48.507 --> 27:50.987
alone and hard at work...

27:51.027 --> 27:54.747
Do you think it's wrong...
to choose love over a career?

27:54.787 --> 27:58.507
My dear, it doesn't
matter a jot what I think.

27:58.547 --> 28:01.267
I've finished my story,
and it's a good one.

28:02.307 --> 28:05.387
The shop girl...
who shines like the stars.

28:06.947 --> 28:09.027
Thank you, ladies.
I'll see you tomorrow.

28:09.067 --> 28:11.067
Thank you, Miss Day.

28:20.867 --> 28:24.107
Well, I always thought the cuckoo
didn't need to build its own nest.

28:26.227 --> 28:28.227
If that's meant to be cutting...

28:28.267 --> 28:30.187
you're gonna have to do better.

28:31.547 --> 28:33.987
I was simply helping Harry
with some...

28:34.027 --> 28:36.067
store promotion.

28:37.107 --> 28:39.507
I know what you said
to Rose Selfridge today.

28:39.547 --> 28:41.547
Rose is a dear friend.

28:41.587 --> 28:45.427
I was simply trying to
give her some... good advice.

28:45.467 --> 28:48.147
To leave town so that
you can steal her husband?

28:48.187 --> 28:51.107
What an utterly ludicrous suggestion.

28:51.147 --> 28:53.147
Is it?

28:53.187 --> 28:55.307
Oh, Delphine.

28:55.347 --> 28:58.067
I've met so many women
like you before.

28:58.107 --> 29:00.987
One who'll do anything
for the lead role or the solo.

29:01.027 --> 29:03.307
All the time pretending to be
your best friend.

29:04.547 --> 29:07.507
It might fool Rose,
but it certainly doesn't fool me.

29:07.547 --> 29:10.827
Please don't compare me
to your music hall trollops.

29:12.187 --> 29:14.627
Who the hell are you to lecture me?

29:15.747 --> 29:17.747
I've read the papers, Mae.

29:17.787 --> 29:20.027
What are you without Loxley's money?

29:20.067 --> 29:22.067
You're just some...

29:22.107 --> 29:24.627
disgraced divorcee without
two pennies to your name.

29:25.587 --> 29:27.987
Oh, you might have
Selfridge's ear today...

29:28.027 --> 29:30.427
But how long do you think
they're gonna stand by you

29:30.467 --> 29:33.587
when Loxley starts
dragging your name through the dirt?

29:33.627 --> 29:35.627
I'll take my chance.

29:35.667 --> 29:38.507
Because, unlike you,
I know who my real friends are.

29:39.907 --> 29:42.547
And... we disgraced divorcees...

29:42.587 --> 29:44.987
you know, we do have one advantage.

29:46.307 --> 29:48.307
Absolutely nothing to lose.

29:50.107 --> 29:52.827
So... here's your choice.

29:52.867 --> 29:54.867
Leave town.

29:54.907 --> 29:57.587
Or I'll tell Rose
exactly what you're up to.

30:09.907 --> 30:12.547
This isn't quite what I expected.
It's what I promised.

30:12.587 --> 30:14.867
2,000 words. No puff pieces.

30:14.907 --> 30:18.227
'With her combination of gritty
determination and cool elegance,

30:18.267 --> 30:21.507
Miss Agnes Towler
is Selfridge's new rising star.'

30:21.547 --> 30:24.027
You found her, you trained her.

30:24.067 --> 30:28.187
But I thought Delphine's promotion
would be of more interest to you.

30:29.227 --> 30:32.827
By making your staff part of the
store, you've transformed their lives.

30:33.827 --> 30:36.907
You wanna appeal to real women?
Let 'em read this.

30:36.947 --> 30:40.547
They'll see what you stand for.
You don't need to dazzle 'em, Harry.

30:40.587 --> 30:43.547
Just... hold up a mirror
and let 'em see themselves.

30:50.187 --> 30:52.187
The tap is fixed.

30:53.987 --> 30:55.987
Wonderful. Thank you, Florian.

30:58.747 --> 31:00.747
Is something wrong?

31:01.787 --> 31:04.467
No. No, nothing.
I have a... slight headache.

31:06.267 --> 31:08.107
In fact, I think I should go to bed.

31:08.147 --> 31:10.347
Goodnight, Agnes.
Goodnight.

31:10.387 --> 31:12.547
Goodnight.

31:57.707 --> 32:00.747
See, Aggie?
I always keep my promises.

32:02.747 --> 32:04.747
I thought I'd lost you!

32:18.000 --> 32:19.700
Bullet took me in the shoulder.

32:19.785 --> 32:22.865
Doctor said another few inches,
I'd've been six feet under.

32:22.959 --> 32:24.959
The hospital sounds awful.

32:24.999 --> 32:27.839
No. Not too pretty.

32:31.439 --> 32:34.479
Engaged!
I can't leave you for a minute!

32:34.519 --> 32:36.719
We'll have our own
little restaurant.

32:36.759 --> 32:40.279
Me and Victor. If we're to be
married, we've got to look to the future.

32:41.279 --> 32:44.039
It's funny. I thought you had yours
all figured out.

32:44.079 --> 32:47.319
Well, I fell in love, George.
You can't plan for that.

32:47.359 --> 32:49.019
True enough.

32:49.049 --> 32:51.209
As long as Mr Colleano

32:51.249 --> 32:53.969
promises to keep you in the style
you've become accustomed.

32:54.009 --> 32:57.929
Goodness. That went down quickly.
Another egg, George?

32:59.769 --> 33:01.809
You twisted my arm!

33:01.849 --> 33:04.009
Have you seen this article
on Miss Towler?

33:04.049 --> 33:07.609
Say what you will about Winifred, she
knows how to tug at the heartstrings.

33:07.649 --> 33:10.209
I must insist, sir! No,
you can't come in here like that!

33:10.249 --> 33:12.609
I demand to see my wife!

33:12.649 --> 33:14.849
I'm sorry, Mr Selfridge.
What on earth is this?

33:14.889 --> 33:17.849
It's none of your business,
Selfridge. I'm here for Mae.

33:17.889 --> 33:20.089
I've had enough of this nonsense.

33:20.129 --> 33:22.289
You're coming home with me now.

33:22.329 --> 33:26.169
Mae is our guest. And she will remain
here till she chooses to leave. Mm-hm.

33:26.209 --> 33:28.169
Do you think
Frank Edwards scares me?

33:29.489 --> 33:32.609
Miles Edgerton knows which side
his bread is buttered on.

33:32.649 --> 33:35.809
Who do you think he came running to
the minute Edwards accosted him?

33:36.849 --> 33:40.209
Old school tie, Mae.
Never underestimate it.

33:40.249 --> 33:43.089
Now, come on!
Stop there, Loxley.

33:43.129 --> 33:47.889
Step aside, Selfridge.
This has nothing to do with you.
What are you gonna do about it?

33:47.929 --> 33:49.929
Hit me the way you hit her?

33:49.969 --> 33:52.449
If you wanna take me on,
we can do it right here.

33:52.489 --> 33:57.329
And believe me, there is
nothing in the world I want more

33:57.369 --> 34:00.769
than to smash your smug little face
into the middle of next week.

34:03.449 --> 34:05.969
So what's it gonna be?

34:09.929 --> 34:11.929
I will drag you through the courts.

34:11.969 --> 34:15.449
I will make sure my lawyers
rake through the details

34:15.489 --> 34:18.329
of every half-remembered
adulterous afternoon.

34:18.369 --> 34:20.369
Believe me, Mae,

34:20.409 --> 34:24.489
by the time I've finished with you,
you will wish you were dead and buried.

34:31.329 --> 34:33.369
Can you believe it?

34:33.409 --> 34:35.409
That bit there.

34:35.449 --> 34:38.449
How are we this morning, ladies?
Look, Miss Hawkins.

34:38.489 --> 34:40.489
The article -
it's all about Miss Towler.

34:40.529 --> 34:43.168
'The Star of Selfridge's.'
Well, I never.

34:44.929 --> 34:48.649
Quick, Jessie. Come with me. There's
a certain person who needs to see this.

34:50.649 --> 34:53.129
Who is it? Who is it?
Just wait and see.

35:13.849 --> 35:15.849
Thank you, Harry, but...

35:17.209 --> 35:21.209
He won't be satisfied now until he's
completely destroyed both of us.

35:22.209 --> 35:24.209
I can help you.

35:24.249 --> 35:27.209
And so can Frank Edwards. Please.

35:27.249 --> 35:30.969
We have to stop him together.
Frank's been trying to contact me.

35:32.369 --> 35:35.089
I'll call him and set up a meeting.
I have to get to the store.

35:35.129 --> 35:37.129
Oh. No, of course.

35:37.169 --> 35:39.169
Harry, erm...

35:39.209 --> 35:42.889
You've done so much for me, and
I really want to return the favour.

35:42.929 --> 35:45.929
I know you've been working
with Delphine Day.

35:45.969 --> 35:48.729
She's been acting as an advisor.

35:48.769 --> 35:50.889
Yes. Please don't trust her.

35:52.209 --> 35:55.209
She's out to destroy everything
that you and Rose have.

36:02.849 --> 36:04.849
Not one single mention of fashion.

36:04.889 --> 36:08.009
It's a disgrace. But the article
itself, Mr Thackeray.

36:08.049 --> 36:11.089
A tour de force. One could hardly
have asked for better publicity.

36:11.129 --> 36:14.689
Good morning, everyone. I'm sure
you've read Mrs Black's article.

36:15.689 --> 36:18.649
Please join me in a round of
applause for Miss Agnes Towler.

36:26.649 --> 36:30.249
And I'm sure you all have heard that
George Towler has returned home safe.

36:30.289 --> 36:32.929
Our prayers have been answered.
A family reunited.

36:33.969 --> 36:37.209
And on that note, I believe that
Mr Grove has some news for us.

36:37.249 --> 36:39.249
Come on up here, Mr Grove.

36:39.289 --> 36:41.289
Thank you, Chief.

36:42.769 --> 36:44.769
I um... Well...

36:44.809 --> 36:47.529
Doris... Mrs Grove and I...

36:47.569 --> 36:50.129
have had our fourth baby.

36:50.169 --> 36:52.729
A healthy baby boy.

36:57.089 --> 36:59.089
I have a son.

36:59.129 --> 37:02.369
Congratulations, Roger.
Congratulations.

37:04.689 --> 37:06.689
Oh, I say!

37:12.609 --> 37:15.329
Told him straight, she did.
Showed my dad the paper

37:15.369 --> 37:18.209
and said what a wonderful
opportunity I'd be passing up. No!

37:41.089 --> 37:43.729
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much. Goodbye.

37:46.049 --> 37:48.049
Miss Mardle.

37:48.089 --> 37:50.089
You have my congratulations,
Mr Grove.

37:50.129 --> 37:52.609
I know you always
dreamed of having a son.

37:54.449 --> 37:57.489
Thank you. Please pass on
my best wishes to Mrs Grove.

38:00.489 --> 38:03.129
'The girl who rose from humble
and difficult beginnings

38:03.169 --> 38:06.569
to mastermind and create
the most wondrous visual displays

38:06.609 --> 38:09.209
in the most prestigious department
store in the world.'

38:09.249 --> 38:12.809
I feel like I should be asking for
your autograph, not your hand in marriage.

38:12.849 --> 38:14.849
Stop it. It's just an article.

38:14.889 --> 38:17.449
She could've chosen anyone.
She chose you.

38:17.489 --> 38:19.489
Can't say I blame her.

38:25.769 --> 38:27.769
You deserve it.

38:27.809 --> 38:29.809
I'm proud of you.

38:31.169 --> 38:33.249
How's your George shaping up?

38:34.289 --> 38:36.409
Like he's... never been away.

38:36.449 --> 38:39.449
He's er... eating Miss Mardle
out of house and home.

38:39.489 --> 38:41.489
I've been thinking.

38:42.489 --> 38:44.569
If George really has to go back...

38:44.609 --> 38:47.369
maybe we should use him
while we still have him.

38:47.409 --> 38:50.009
I mean, I am gonna need a best man.

38:51.529 --> 38:53.529
Oh. Get married now?

38:53.569 --> 38:55.329
Why not?

38:55.369 --> 38:57.369
We could organise it in a few days.

38:57.409 --> 38:59.489
Family are all here,
with George here.

38:59.529 --> 39:01.529
Nothing to stop us.

39:01.569 --> 39:03.689
No.

39:03.729 --> 39:05.729
What do you say?

39:05.769 --> 39:09.329
In a fortnight's time...
you could be Mrs Colleano.

39:10.889 --> 39:14.329
Nothing to fear. I'm sure Delphine'll
have the Palm Court crammed by now.

39:14.369 --> 39:16.689
I wish I shared your confidence,
Mr Selfridge.

39:17.689 --> 39:19.929
I do find rampant innovation
a little trying.

39:19.969 --> 39:22.969
Remember the summer house, Mr Crabb.
She proved you wrong then.

39:23.009 --> 39:25.409
Indeed. And I'm sure she will again.

39:34.569 --> 39:36.569
Harry.
Uh...

39:39.889 --> 39:41.889
Hm.

39:48.849 --> 39:50.849
I can make the
Spirit of Delphine's work.

39:50.889 --> 39:53.609
I just need you to give me
a little bit more time.

39:53.649 --> 39:55.649
Perhaps if we...

39:55.689 --> 39:58.569
put our heads together on this -
we make such a good team.

39:58.609 --> 40:01.329
No. My instinct is
we need a new strategy.

40:01.369 --> 40:04.249
Rose said as much,
and I should have listened to her.

40:04.289 --> 40:06.289
What do you mean?

40:06.329 --> 40:09.449
Her instincts are that in these times
we need to keep it simple.

40:10.929 --> 40:13.649
I think what you need... right now...

40:14.689 --> 40:16.689
..is me.

40:16.729 --> 40:19.049
Why is that?

40:19.089 --> 40:21.809
Because I understand you, Harry.

40:22.849 --> 40:25.049
I know... what drives you.

40:25.089 --> 40:27.529
Which is why I think...
in your heart of hearts...

40:28.889 --> 40:31.049
..you know we belong together.

40:33.289 --> 40:36.769
I don't have feelings for you,
Delphine. I love my wife.

40:36.809 --> 40:39.489
I've made mistakes in the past.

40:39.529 --> 40:42.089
I've failed her many times.

40:44.249 --> 40:46.529
But if you really wanna know
what drives me...

40:46.569 --> 40:48.569
it's Rose.

40:48.609 --> 40:51.649
Everything I've ever done -
this store,

40:51.689 --> 40:54.409
every brick, every counter...

40:55.649 --> 40:58.089
It's all been for her.

40:58.129 --> 41:00.129
One day...

41:00.169 --> 41:02.849
I hope you find someone
who feels the same about you.

41:04.969 --> 41:06.969
But I'm not that man.

41:08.249 --> 41:10.529
Goodbye, Delphine.

41:10.569 --> 41:12.569
I doubt our paths will cross again.

41:30.529 --> 41:33.689
You look tired.
I've had quite a day.

41:34.689 --> 41:36.689
Kiss me.
Mm.

41:36.729 --> 41:39.409
Any particular reason?
Because I'm in love with you.

41:39.449 --> 41:41.449
Is that good enough?

41:41.489 --> 41:43.489
I can't think of a better one.

41:47.369 --> 41:49.369
No!
I'm afraid so.

41:57.769 --> 41:59.769
Ah!

41:59.809 --> 42:01.809
There they are.

42:02.969 --> 42:04.969
Good to see you!

42:09.769 --> 42:11.769
Ma.
