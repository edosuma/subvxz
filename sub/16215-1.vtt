[crowd gasps]

00:22.156 --> 00:25.226
[crowd] Whoa!
[applause]

00:38.939 --> 00:42.410
[bass and trumpet playing]

01:08.736 --> 01:10.271
[door creaks]

02:39.960 --> 02:42.796
[bird cooing]

02:45.766 --> 02:49.437
[chattering]

02:59.213 --> 03:01.649
[chattering continues]

03:25.306 --> 03:26.907
What's the reserve?

03:29.176 --> 03:30.911
Mid to late fives.

03:33.046 --> 03:34.948
Caveats?
Hmm?

03:35.015 --> 03:37.351
Any, uh, caveats
on the property?

03:37.418 --> 03:40.053
-Did you just say that?
-What?

03:40.120 --> 03:41.589
What you just said.
When?

03:41.655 --> 03:43.223
There you go.

03:44.024 --> 03:45.659
I'm sorry.

03:45.726 --> 03:49.763
I'm just-- I'm having
the most incredible déjà-vu.

03:49.830 --> 03:52.666
When?
When?

03:54.568 --> 03:56.604
I knew you were
gonna to say that.

03:56.670 --> 03:59.273
Say something else.
What?

03:59.340 --> 04:01.642
No... that wasn't it.

04:01.709 --> 04:03.677
Wasn't what?

04:05.078 --> 04:06.714
[groans]

04:07.415 --> 04:09.317
No, it's gone.

04:10.384 --> 04:11.652
You were saying?

04:11.719 --> 04:13.421
[bell ringing]

04:14.422 --> 04:16.589
At 40 now.
Fifty if you like now.

04:16.656 --> 04:19.427
At 5.5 in front
against my starter.

04:19.493 --> 04:21.060
Taking 10 still, sir.

04:21.128 --> 04:24.264
-At 550,000, six if you like,
back to the starter.
-[baby fussing]

04:24.332 --> 04:27.167
I have you back in at 5.6,
seven if you like now.

04:27.234 --> 04:29.637
At 5.6 and 70 if you like.

04:29.703 --> 04:31.339
At 70 now. At 80, can I say?

04:31.405 --> 04:33.474
At 570,000. Eighty.

04:33.541 --> 04:37.077
Back in
with my starter at 580.
Ninety can I say now?

04:37.144 --> 04:38.379
All done, all finished--
Ninety-five.

04:38.446 --> 04:39.913
Taking ten, sir.

04:39.980 --> 04:41.815
At 590,000 now.

04:41.882 --> 04:43.250
Taking 600 thou.

04:43.317 --> 04:45.986
First call, you're out there.
Surely not.

04:46.053 --> 04:49.690
It's good buying there.
It's only money, relax,
spend freely.

04:49.757 --> 04:53.594
At 590,000, we'll take your five
if you like then, sir.

04:53.661 --> 04:55.663
At 595.
Six hundred.

04:55.729 --> 04:58.065
-Six hundred straight back in
against you now.
-Five.

04:58.131 --> 05:00.434
At 605, calling 10 now. 610.

05:00.501 --> 05:02.202
Fifteen if you want it now.
Got 615.
Five.

05:02.269 --> 05:03.637
Twenty now can I say?

05:03.704 --> 05:06.740
At 620, at 25 now if you like.
Got 25.

05:06.807 --> 05:09.343
Thirty now. At 625.
Thirty here.
You watch.

05:09.410 --> 05:10.744
Thirty-five and--
640.

05:10.811 --> 05:13.046
640. Good to have you in.
Welcome to the bidding, sir.

05:13.113 --> 05:15.148
-Fifty if you like.
Got 50 here.
-[man] Sixty.

05:15.215 --> 05:17.117
Sixty now.
Seventy if you like now.

05:17.184 --> 05:18.519
At 670 bid now.

05:18.586 --> 05:20.888
680.
Eighty here, back in at 80.

05:20.954 --> 05:22.022
We'll take your 90 now.

05:22.089 --> 05:26.293
At 680,000, all done,
all finished and silent.

05:26.360 --> 05:28.328
Going, going, going and sold.

05:28.396 --> 05:30.197
Congratulations.
Give a round of applause.

05:30.263 --> 05:33.266
Well bought, sir.
[applause]

05:33.333 --> 05:36.770
On behalf of Phillip Lang
Real Estate, congratulations
to our purchaser.

05:36.837 --> 05:38.639
[mumbles]
Ladies and gentlemen,
have a wonderful afternoon.

05:38.706 --> 05:40.608
-Thank you.
-Congratulations.

05:40.674 --> 05:42.510
Thank you.
What you thought it'd go for?

05:42.576 --> 05:43.911
I thought
it'd be just under six.

05:43.977 --> 05:46.547
Philip Lang Real Estate.
Mate, come inside,
sign a contract.

05:46.614 --> 05:49.116
Have you done any developments
like this in the area before?

05:49.182 --> 05:51.452
This will be the first
this side of town.
Oh, right.

05:51.519 --> 05:54.455
What have you done previously?
What sort of--
A couple of bits and pieces--

05:54.522 --> 05:57.591
[chattering]
[bird cooing]

06:08.936 --> 06:11.705
[chattering]

06:14.241 --> 06:15.543
Sign at the back.
Yeah, sure.

06:15.609 --> 06:18.679
Frank.
Phillip.

06:18.746 --> 06:21.449
Good result today.
Hmm.

06:21.515 --> 06:24.718
No, no, no, good result.
Well done.

06:28.355 --> 06:31.592
You're in a mood.
No, I'm not.

06:31.659 --> 06:33.594
Just a bird shat on me.

06:33.661 --> 06:37.865
That's supposed to be
good luck, isn't it?
Not if I catch the little prick.

06:37.931 --> 06:41.469
Why don't you go outside
and whack the sold sticker
up for us?

06:45.372 --> 06:47.040
Nice jaunty angle.

06:49.376 --> 06:51.111
[bird cooing]

06:57.585 --> 06:58.752
[engine starts]
See ya, mate.

06:58.819 --> 07:00.420
[Frank]
Yeah, see ya later, mate.

07:02.089 --> 07:05.526
Hey, darling,
how are you going?
Good. How'd you go?

07:05.593 --> 07:08.195
Smashed it at 680.
Well done.

07:10.097 --> 07:11.632
[man] You're a prick, mate.

07:11.699 --> 07:15.503
Early 500's, you said.
Mid-fives at most.

07:15.569 --> 07:19.640
Well, the market is a bit
more volatile than usual
at the moment.

07:19.707 --> 07:22.610
That's bullshit and you know it.
You're a bullshit artist.

07:30.117 --> 07:31.719
[sighs]

07:31.785 --> 07:34.021
How can you say mid-fives
at the inspection

07:34.087 --> 07:37.257
and then on auction day,
the property isn't even
on the market until 650?

07:37.324 --> 07:39.527
I didn't.
You bloody did, mate.

07:39.593 --> 07:41.461
This is the eighth time.

07:41.529 --> 07:45.566
Jameson Street last September.
Harrow Road, Langley Street
before Christmas.

07:45.633 --> 07:49.369
There's gotta be some tribunal
or some ombudsman or something
we can go to.

07:49.436 --> 07:51.505
Yeah, well there's a--
Sorry to interrupt.

07:51.572 --> 07:54.975
-Phillip Lang,
Phillip Lang Real Estate.
-Uh, yeah, Adam Tregonning.

07:55.042 --> 07:57.811
G'day, Adam. And?
Ah, this is Julie.

07:57.878 --> 08:01.214
And who's
this little scoundrel?
Ah, this is Ben.

08:01.281 --> 08:03.584
-You got your mum's good looks,
haven't you, mate?
-[baby cooing]

08:03.651 --> 08:06.353
With any luck you've got
your old man's nouse.

08:06.419 --> 08:08.956
Yeah, I was just saying
to Frank here earlier,
wasn't I, Frank?

08:09.022 --> 08:10.057
Uh, yeah.

08:10.123 --> 08:12.125
Yes, I was just saying,
there's a smart bidder.

08:12.192 --> 08:14.528
Here's a man who understands
the property market
at the moment.

08:14.595 --> 08:16.897
When you dropped out
of the bidding,
that was exactly right.

08:16.964 --> 08:20.000
Exactly the property's worth.
Yeah, right.

08:20.067 --> 08:21.969
I don't know
where these cowboys
get there money.

08:22.035 --> 08:25.305
What did it go for in the end?
A bit north of 680, was it?
680.

08:25.372 --> 08:27.340
680, was it?
Yeah, 680.
Yeah.

08:27.407 --> 08:29.209
Silly money.
I dips m'lid to you.

08:29.276 --> 08:31.511
I was just saying
to Frank inside,
wasn't I, Frank?

08:31.579 --> 08:33.581
Yeah.
Yeah, very good bidding
on your part.

08:35.015 --> 08:37.350
We should go
if we're gonna get
to that other thing.

08:37.417 --> 08:40.520
Oh, yeah, the thing.
No, the other one.

08:41.388 --> 08:43.724
Wonderful to meet you.
Wonderful.

08:49.362 --> 08:52.199
[baby cooing]

08:52.265 --> 08:53.801
[Frank]
Thanks for that.

08:53.867 --> 08:56.103
There is actually something
I wanna show you.

08:56.169 --> 08:59.306
Where are you parked?
Oh, just over there.

08:59.372 --> 09:01.875
Yeah, well, follow me.
It's just around the corner.

09:01.942 --> 09:03.176
[car alarm chirps]
Right.

09:03.243 --> 09:05.713
[classical music playing]

09:08.248 --> 09:11.151
[humming]

09:13.053 --> 09:14.755
[man on radio]
His hand pass missed Campbell,

09:14.822 --> 09:17.057
Saulsy was there
but James Gowan steals.

09:17.124 --> 09:20.694
Thomas gets the hand pass.
It goes straight past Sainsbury.

09:20.761 --> 09:22.495
Duigan on the mark up
to McGuinness.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.965
[classical music continues]

09:25.032 --> 09:27.100
[man on radio]
His kick finds a target...

09:28.568 --> 09:30.037
[door creaks]

09:34.775 --> 09:36.844
I'll see you in the kitchen.

09:40.513 --> 09:41.849
[switch clicks]

09:45.185 --> 09:47.187
[floor creaks]

09:50.791 --> 09:52.225
[switch clicks]

09:53.994 --> 09:55.696
[sighs]

10:08.141 --> 10:09.810
[smacks lips]

10:21.054 --> 10:23.156
[chattering]

10:33.734 --> 10:35.368
[switch clicks]

10:48.515 --> 10:51.919
[taps several piano keys]

11:02.595 --> 11:05.265
[floor creaking]

11:10.470 --> 11:12.372
Mm-hmm.

11:14.875 --> 11:16.877
There's more.
[door creaks]

11:16.944 --> 11:19.012
There's a nativity scene.

11:21.648 --> 11:24.451
[bird cooing]
Oh, bloody sprinklers.

11:25.385 --> 11:26.920
[latch clangs]

11:32.159 --> 11:34.694
[flies buzzing]

11:40.567 --> 11:44.872
[organ playing, faint]

11:47.340 --> 11:49.176
[baby crying, faint]

12:00.120 --> 12:03.757
Deceased estate?
No, no, not yet.

12:03.824 --> 12:06.026
Any day now though,
I'm told.

12:06.093 --> 12:08.128
Thoughts?
Depends.
What do you wanna hear?

12:08.195 --> 12:09.897
Well, I wanna hear
your thoughts.

12:09.963 --> 12:12.565
Well, I'd say
it was a good listing.

12:12.632 --> 12:14.802
North-facing backyard.

12:15.635 --> 12:18.872
Deep block. Wide frontage.

12:18.939 --> 12:21.041
Leafy, tree-lined street.
Well, write me the board.

12:21.108 --> 12:22.442
Why? You offering me
the listing, Phillip?

12:22.509 --> 12:24.444
No. I'm thinking
of offering you the listing.

12:24.511 --> 12:27.147
Don't look at me like that,
Frank, you know why.
Right.

12:27.214 --> 12:29.482
You know what I'm thinking.
Uh-huh.

12:29.549 --> 12:32.119
It was a good solid result
this morning.
It was a result, wasn't it?

12:32.185 --> 12:34.321
No, it was a good solid result.

12:34.387 --> 12:36.957
Do you mind turning
this thing off?
No, yeah, no.

12:37.024 --> 12:39.092
It's on a timer.
I don't know where
the switch is.

12:39.159 --> 12:41.594
It'll be on the other end
of the hose, don't you reckon?

12:41.661 --> 12:44.064
You'd think, yeah.
Oi.

12:44.131 --> 12:47.167
Anyway, good solid result,
is all I'm saying.

12:47.234 --> 12:51.805
Yeah. Well, Frank, Livvy
is back at the office working
tirelessly on the medallion.

12:51.872 --> 12:53.740
I think
it's at the engravers.
Solid result.

12:53.807 --> 12:57.945
Yeah, I believe "solid result"
is the actual inscription,
Frank.

12:58.011 --> 13:01.481
Property would have sold itself,
is another way of looking
at it, Frank.

13:01.548 --> 13:06.086
Double-fronted brick,
a nanosecond from schools,
cafés and public transport.

13:06.153 --> 13:08.321
I've got a 12-year-old
great-nephew, Frank.

13:08.388 --> 13:11.791
His knuckles touch the ground
slightly as he walks and he
breathes only through the mouth.

13:11.859 --> 13:14.661
I reckon he could have
got a similar result
with this listing.

13:14.727 --> 13:17.030
And I had the Übermensch
wielding the gavel for you.

13:17.097 --> 13:18.665
He's good.
Yeah, he is good, isn't he?

13:18.731 --> 13:21.101
He's very good.
Why don't you give
the listing to Hamish?

13:21.168 --> 13:23.270
If you don't have a problem
with breathing through the mouth

13:23.336 --> 13:25.105
and dragging knuckles.
Hamish is not in a--

13:25.172 --> 13:28.741
Pigeons don't shit on Hamish.
Hamish is not in a mood
is what I was gonna say.

13:28.808 --> 13:32.880
But you're right,
pigeons don't shit on Hamish.
Hamish went to a private school.

13:32.946 --> 13:36.616
All I'm asking, Frank,
is that you to have a crack
at writing the board.

13:36.683 --> 13:40.153
You'd think I was asking
for the sealing
of the bloody Magna Carta.

13:46.359 --> 13:47.895
[Frank sighs]

13:51.431 --> 13:54.501
Attention first home buyers
and investors.

13:54.567 --> 13:57.837
This beautiful two-bedroom home
with open fireplaces

13:57.905 --> 14:01.374
and potential
off-street parking,
subject to council approval,

14:01.441 --> 14:04.978
boasts a wonderful opportunity
to improve.

14:05.045 --> 14:09.682
You could... knock down
this much-loved family home,

14:09.749 --> 14:14.187
whose last occupant
is-- is currently withering
in a nursing home,

14:14.254 --> 14:18.926
public nursing home,
somewhere in a growth corridor,

14:18.992 --> 14:22.162
while her scabrous offspring,

14:22.229 --> 14:26.967
the pernicious little shits
she farted into the world,

14:27.034 --> 14:31.471
try to sell all her memories
off this blue-chip locale
right from under her.

14:31.538 --> 14:36.944
You could renovate, or you
could raze this meticulous
and much-loved family home.

14:38.711 --> 14:41.481
Geez, I'm sorry, Phil.
I'm really sorry.
No, no, you're right.

14:41.548 --> 14:44.417
You're right.
I ju-- Oh!

14:44.484 --> 14:47.520
Look, it's your fault.
You started this.

14:48.888 --> 14:50.857
Look, it's my Tourette's,
all right?
I've got Tourette's.

14:50.924 --> 14:53.293
I wasn't talking about you.

14:53.360 --> 14:55.762
Well, yeah, you were.
No, I wasn't.

14:55.828 --> 14:58.331
Really, I wasn't.
[cell phone rings]

14:58.398 --> 15:01.234
I'm sorry. I have to--
I have to take this. Hang on.

15:04.137 --> 15:06.673
[sighs] Yep.
[woman on phone]
I'm a shit mother.

15:07.840 --> 15:09.909
Why are you a shit mother?
I am.

15:11.211 --> 15:14.081
No, you're not shit at it.
Frank's busted his arm.

15:14.147 --> 15:16.816
All right. But--

15:16.883 --> 15:20.520
I haven't been there.
I haven't been there all year.
It's not like he's dead.

15:20.587 --> 15:23.356
I mean, it's not like,
okay, road trauma.

15:23.423 --> 15:25.758
He's not diseased.
You should go.

15:25.825 --> 15:27.527
I just got here.
I panicked.

15:27.594 --> 15:30.663
I called the first number
on speed dial.
I'm on speed dial?

15:30.730 --> 15:33.633
Oh, Frank, just shut up.
Shut up.

15:33.700 --> 15:35.868
Why are you acting
so defensively?
Please.

15:35.935 --> 15:38.338
I'm not.
Yeah, you are.

15:38.405 --> 15:40.773
Otherwise why would you
be saying "please"?

15:40.840 --> 15:43.076
Because that's how it is now.

15:43.143 --> 15:46.013
I'm either saying please
or sorry

15:46.079 --> 15:48.815
or explaining myself
to somebody.

15:48.881 --> 15:51.184
Checkout chicks,
the newsagent,

15:51.251 --> 15:54.354
the props guy, the people
that did the guttering.

15:54.421 --> 15:55.888
God! What's wrong
with the guttering?

15:55.955 --> 15:59.126
Just go.
Okay.

15:59.826 --> 16:01.461
I will.

16:01.528 --> 16:05.698
You know,
you've gotta stop thinking
that you're the shit one.

16:07.067 --> 16:09.302
And you've--
you've gotta start,
you know,

16:09.369 --> 16:11.571
putting some distance
between us.

16:11.638 --> 16:15.942
You know, properly,
like you're supposed to.
Yeah.

16:16.009 --> 16:19.712
I mean for starters,
take-- take my name
off speed dial.

16:19.779 --> 16:22.015
All right?

16:22.082 --> 16:26.186
You know, it's like
this-- this divorce
is not gonna work for me.

16:27.120 --> 16:28.588
I mean, it's weird enough
as it is.

16:29.889 --> 16:31.691
How is he?
Oh, look, he's fine.

16:31.758 --> 16:34.327
It's just
a greenstick fracture.
You okay, sweetie?

16:34.394 --> 16:36.396
He's fine.
We'll x-ray him again
in a fortnight,

16:36.463 --> 16:40.100
and there really shouldn't
be any reason why we can't
take the cast off after that.

16:40.167 --> 16:42.302
Frank.
Frank.

16:42.369 --> 16:44.271
How's it going?
Good.

16:44.337 --> 16:46.773
How's school?
Good.

16:48.208 --> 16:50.743
Broke your arm,
they're saying.
Yeah, fracture.

16:52.245 --> 16:54.314
-Rehearsal?
-Yeah, rehearsals.

16:54.381 --> 16:57.417
Was it dress rehearsals,
or is this what all the kids
are wearing these days?

16:57.484 --> 16:59.586
-We better go. You okay, hon?
-Yep.

16:59.652 --> 17:02.622
Do I need to sign him out?
They'll look after you
at the front desk.

17:02.689 --> 17:05.692
I'll just grab the paperwork
and meet you up there.
Right.

17:05.758 --> 17:09.561
This isn't entirely appropriate,
I know, but can I just say
I love you in the show?

17:09.628 --> 17:13.031
Oh. Um, thanks. Thanks.
[chuckles]

17:18.938 --> 17:21.773
[chattering]
[Frank]
Do you really like the show?

17:22.608 --> 17:23.476
Yeah.

17:23.542 --> 17:26.479
I'd say it's generally
pretty accurate.

17:27.579 --> 17:29.249
Really?

17:29.316 --> 17:32.519
Well, no one actually says
"stat" in Australia, but--

17:32.585 --> 17:34.887
It's more
of an American thing.

17:34.954 --> 17:36.656
So what do they say?

17:37.790 --> 17:41.494
Quick... or quickly.
Right.

17:42.562 --> 17:43.530
Or please.

17:44.664 --> 17:47.134
[chattering]

17:51.003 --> 17:55.175
[Frank narrating] Unit two,
56 Ostral Street, Linden Park.

17:55.242 --> 17:58.311
Ideal for premier living
or as an investment,

17:58.378 --> 18:01.514
this easy to maintain
one-bedroom,
ground-floor apartment

18:01.581 --> 18:04.651
provides a wonderful opportunity
for cosmetic improvement.

18:04.717 --> 18:09.189
Property also offers kitchen
and laundry facilities.

18:09.256 --> 18:13.993
Get away from it all
in this quiet, secluded
cul-de-sac situation.

18:14.060 --> 18:17.430
[phone ringing]

18:18.765 --> 18:20.367
[rings]

18:21.201 --> 18:23.303

[rings]

18:30.076 --> 18:31.711
[rings, phone beeps]

18:33.079 --> 18:35.848
Yeah.
[woman] Hello, dear.

18:38.585 --> 18:40.720
Who's this?
Oh, sweetheart.
It's your mother.

18:42.155 --> 18:43.623
Mum.

18:44.957 --> 18:47.093
Really?
Yes, really.

18:47.160 --> 18:49.229
My God, you must be tired.

18:49.296 --> 18:51.331
No, no, no,
well, yeah, I'm just--

18:51.398 --> 18:53.666
Oh, poor love.

18:53.733 --> 18:55.835
It's just that you never
called me "dear" before.

18:55.902 --> 18:58.605
Of course I have.
What are you talking about?
Or sweetheart, for that matter.

18:58.671 --> 19:00.907
Oh, that is rot.
I call you sweetheart
all the time.

19:00.973 --> 19:02.141
No, you don't.
Yes, I do.

19:02.209 --> 19:04.277
No, you don't.
Yes, I do.

19:04.344 --> 19:06.613
Okay. Uh, fine.

19:06.679 --> 19:10.217
Um... how are you?

19:10.283 --> 19:13.720
Oh, you know, the hip's
playing up a bit
in this weather.

19:13.786 --> 19:15.488
Your hip?
What's wrong with your hip?

19:15.555 --> 19:18.325
Same old trouble.
You know, it gets a bit stiff.

19:19.959 --> 19:21.228
[inhales] Right.

19:21.294 --> 19:23.396
Are you smoking?
No.

19:23.463 --> 19:25.298
Yes, you are.
I can tell.

19:25.365 --> 19:27.700
Uh, how?
How can you tell?

19:27.767 --> 19:30.270
Well, I'm your mother.
I can tell by the way
you're breathing.

19:30.337 --> 19:34.307
Mum. Mum,
I breathe all the time.

19:34.374 --> 19:36.175
Just because I'm breathing
doesn't mean I'm smoking.

19:36.243 --> 19:38.511
Now, dar--
Please don't let's argue.

19:38.578 --> 19:41.714
I'm not. I'm not.
I'm just saying
that non-smokers breathe.

19:41.781 --> 19:45.618
I didn't call to have
another argument.

19:45.685 --> 19:47.987
Okay,
I'm putting it out, all right?
I'm putting it out.

19:48.054 --> 19:51.391
Do you want me to worry
about you some more?
No, look, sorry, you're right.

19:51.458 --> 19:55.295
And what happened?
Did I wean you too early?
What?

19:55.362 --> 19:57.764
You need to be on the boob
a bit longer?
No!

19:57.830 --> 20:00.567
I mean,
what do you want, sweetheart,
peripheral vascular disease,

20:00.633 --> 20:02.569
heart disease,
cancer of the liver,

20:02.635 --> 20:04.871
lungs, prostate cancer,
gangrene?

20:04.937 --> 20:07.874
Take your pick. They list them
all on the packaging.
Um--

20:07.940 --> 20:08.975
Hmm?
Are you all right?

20:09.041 --> 20:11.978
Well, actually, no, because
my hip's giving me misery.

20:12.044 --> 20:16.082
Yeah, no, I mean,
you sound different.
Well, I would, wouldn't I?

20:16.148 --> 20:19.319
You know, it's been weeks
since you've-- you've
bothered to call

20:19.386 --> 20:21.554
your poor, lonely,
gray-haired old mother.

20:21.621 --> 20:23.923
Months.
Oh, hang on.
I mean, I've been really busy.

20:23.990 --> 20:26.826
Oh, and, during which time
your fingers got broken.

20:26.893 --> 20:29.729
Now I'm only saying that
you could call your mother
on occasion.

20:29.796 --> 20:33.400
Yeah, I know, I know, I could,
I should, but, you know--

20:33.466 --> 20:37.036
Have you read the papers lately?
Have you come across the word
"recession" in any of them?

20:37.103 --> 20:38.905
Oh, now,
that's hardly an excuse.

20:38.971 --> 20:41.874
I know it's not an excuse.
I've just got a lot on my--

20:41.941 --> 20:44.210
I've just got a lot on my plate
at the moment.

20:44.277 --> 20:48.080
And now, you-- you told me
that-- that your job
was recession proof.

20:48.147 --> 20:51.684
Oh, I wish.
Oh, well.

20:51.751 --> 20:54.220
Oh, I know,
the world has gone silly.

20:54.287 --> 20:57.690
You know, I'm on
this six-month waiting list
for this hip,

20:57.757 --> 20:59.892
and they're calling it
elective surgery

20:59.959 --> 21:02.629
and that's just because
I don't have a liver
hanging out of me.

21:02.695 --> 21:06.666
Right.
And they've got the gall
to call it rationalism.

21:06.733 --> 21:09.802
Anyway, that's not your problem.

21:11.571 --> 21:12.739
Um--

21:14.907 --> 21:18.177
We didn't ever speak like this
before, did we?

21:18.244 --> 21:20.413
Well, how do you mean?

21:20.480 --> 21:25.117
Well, I mean, I never thought
that you had a world view.
Maybe because I don't have one.

21:25.184 --> 21:28.888
I mean, Wendy's
always saying I don't.
Right.

21:28.955 --> 21:33.626
[sighs]
Anyway, look, I'm really sorry.

21:33.693 --> 21:36.228
I'm really sorry that,
you know, I didn't call you.

21:36.295 --> 21:38.297
Um, it's-- Uh, sweetheart?

21:39.532 --> 21:41.734
Yeah?
Who's Wendy?

21:41.801 --> 21:42.869
Wendy.

21:42.935 --> 21:45.405
Wendy. My wife, Wendy.

21:45.472 --> 21:46.639
Well, you're--
you're not married.

21:46.706 --> 21:48.575
Oh, great, thanks.
Yeah, okay, Mum.

21:48.641 --> 21:50.543
Yeah, ex. Ex-wife.
Thank you very much, Mum.

21:50.610 --> 21:52.479
Oh, no, look, you were
just saying yourself

21:52.545 --> 21:56.215
that we have just been having
the first decent conversation
we've had for quite some time,

21:56.282 --> 21:59.386
and then you go and you ruin it
by being a smart aleck again.

21:59.452 --> 22:02.922
Honestly, Damien, I just--
[sighs]

22:05.324 --> 22:08.528
Pardon?
You heard me.

22:12.699 --> 22:15.402
Who is this?
Who is--

22:15.468 --> 22:18.037
Who do you think it is?

22:18.104 --> 22:19.606
Um...

22:22.174 --> 22:24.511
Emily Mollard.
Oh, come on.

22:24.577 --> 22:28.548
Who in heaven's name
is Emily Mollard?

22:31.283 --> 22:34.521
Which number did you dial?
Um--

22:34.587 --> 22:37.557
Oh, my God!
Oh, I haven't, have I?

22:37.624 --> 22:42.328
Um, 70-106-389?

22:42.395 --> 22:46.599
[clicks tongue]
Yeah, it's... 89630.

22:46.666 --> 22:50.169
Oh, my God.
I am so, so sorry.

22:50.236 --> 22:53.272
It's okay.
No, no don't apologize.
No, no, I am so--

22:53.339 --> 22:56.443
No, no, no, it's really fine.
Hey, listen--
[hangs up]

23:09.355 --> 23:12.559
[beeps]
[man on TV] I don't know
what you're talking about.

23:12.625 --> 23:14.727
[woman on TV]
I'm just saying

23:14.794 --> 23:17.464
if you don't do something
about this now,

23:17.530 --> 23:20.299
it might be something
you'll regret
for the rest of your life.

23:20.366 --> 23:21.801
[thunder rumbles]

23:21.868 --> 23:23.936
[man on TV] Butler's Homewares
and Electrical Warehouse,

23:24.003 --> 23:26.839
where you'll find table lamps
in a variety of colors
and styles--

23:26.906 --> 23:30.577
[woman on phone]
To return the call,
press one now.

23:31.377 --> 23:32.445
[phone beeps]

23:32.512 --> 23:36.749
[line ringing]

23:36.816 --> 23:40.787
[woman on phone] Hello?
Hello. Um, it's Frank Mollard.

23:40.853 --> 23:44.924
We were, um, speaking earlier.
How did you get this number?

23:44.991 --> 23:48.127
Oh, there's a--
there's a redial thingy
on the phone.

23:48.194 --> 23:51.464
You press star-10-hash
and the number pops up.

23:51.531 --> 23:53.733
Oh.

23:53.800 --> 23:56.335
Anyway, I'm-- [clears throat]

23:56.402 --> 23:59.606
I'm sorry about before.
And, um--

23:59.672 --> 24:02.942
I-I don't mean to--
to trouble you, but--

24:05.912 --> 24:09.882
[sighs]
I'm just gonna say it. Um--

24:13.185 --> 24:15.955
My mum died late last year.

24:16.022 --> 24:19.692
And I know what you're thinking.
I mean, how could I possibly
think you were her if she's--

24:21.460 --> 24:24.531
You know, if she's... dead.

24:25.965 --> 24:31.337
I just... wanted you to know
that I'm not weird
or unbalanced.

24:31.403 --> 24:33.205
I don't even read horoscopes.

24:34.306 --> 24:36.576
[thunder rumbles]

24:36.643 --> 24:38.945
You just sound so much like her.

24:40.980 --> 24:42.481
Your voice.

24:44.150 --> 24:46.919
And-- [scoffs]

24:48.287 --> 24:49.956
I just miss her.

24:53.459 --> 24:55.394
Anyway, I'll let you go.

24:55.461 --> 24:57.196
I just--

24:59.331 --> 25:01.100
Just wanted to let you go.

25:04.370 --> 25:06.839
But I wanted to explain. Um--

25:08.808 --> 25:10.610
Frank?
I should let you go.

25:10.677 --> 25:13.045
Frank, is it?
Mm-hmm.

25:13.946 --> 25:16.916
What did you say her name was?
Who?

25:16.983 --> 25:20.252
Who you were talking to.
Oh, oh, um--

25:23.856 --> 25:25.157
Emily.

25:26.559 --> 25:30.262
[man]
Not too many natives about.
That's good, I suppose.

25:31.731 --> 25:33.499
Oh, Christ, look at 'em now.

25:33.566 --> 25:36.068
Oh, Jesus,
they'll go crook at us now.

25:36.135 --> 25:38.938
Ooh, ooh.
[shudders]

25:39.005 --> 25:43.342
Uh, number one, talk.
Talk.

25:43.409 --> 25:46.245
Point the bloody gun at 'im.

25:46.312 --> 25:47.580
Frighten 'im, George.

25:47.647 --> 25:50.016
Write IOU,

25:50.082 --> 25:54.353
uh, big government of Australia
and we'll pay 'im.

25:54.420 --> 25:56.789
Dad, it's all right.
It's all right.

25:56.856 --> 25:59.258
[breathing heavily]
All right, good.
Uh, you tell 'im.

25:59.325 --> 26:02.261
Uh, tell 'im we'll pay 'im.
Dad, it's Phillip.

26:02.328 --> 26:05.131
Yeah, it's Phillip, Dad.
I'm here. I'm here.

26:05.197 --> 26:09.636
Oh, Phillip.
Sir, uh, you have to write
on a bit of paper.

26:09.702 --> 26:13.005
Um, have you got
a bit of paper?

26:13.072 --> 26:16.342
Uh, someone's getting
a bit of paper.

26:16.408 --> 26:18.044
Uh, uh--

26:18.110 --> 26:22.815
Big government...
Australia...
belonged to me. Yes.

26:22.882 --> 26:26.052
[chattering]
Oh. Oh, Christ.

26:32.759 --> 26:35.862
[Olivia] Morning.
Morning.

26:36.963 --> 26:40.066
Any messages?
On the spike.

26:40.132 --> 26:42.334
[paper rustling]

26:43.670 --> 26:44.937
[computer beeps]

26:52.578 --> 26:54.714
These are all for Hamish.

26:54.781 --> 26:56.315
[computer beeps]
Yep.

26:57.483 --> 26:59.451
[phone rings]
Is Phillip in?

26:59.518 --> 27:01.087
Yep.

27:01.153 --> 27:05.057
[phone ringing]
You don't know what
a flash player is,

27:05.124 --> 27:07.159
do you,
by any chance?
No.

27:07.226 --> 27:10.963
Why can I not get on to my own
Web site if I haven't got one?
I don't know.

27:11.030 --> 27:13.032
What's going on
with Olivia's haircut?

27:13.099 --> 27:15.467
Oh. Yeah, God knows.
[computer chirps]

27:15.534 --> 27:16.936
She didn't
have surgery, did she?

27:17.003 --> 27:18.838
I wouldn't think so,
not over the weekend.

27:18.905 --> 27:21.941
Do you think there'd be
potential property buyers
who haven't got a flash player?

27:22.008 --> 27:23.810
I don't know. Probably.
What is a flash player?

27:23.876 --> 27:25.311
It's not just a haircut,
is it?

27:25.377 --> 27:27.680
I paid her bloody emo friends
good money for this.

27:27.747 --> 27:31.050
You want a check, don't you?
You know it won't clear
till Friday.

27:31.117 --> 27:34.653
No. No, no.
I came to apologize.

27:34.721 --> 27:38.424
-Oh, really?
-I'd just like us to go on
pretending that I'm not--

27:38.490 --> 27:41.994
It's asking me to push "okay."
I'm not going to get a virus
if I push okay?

27:42.061 --> 27:44.363
I don't know.
No, you wouldn't know.
I'm going to push "okay."

27:44.430 --> 27:45.732
Whoa!

27:47.033 --> 27:49.068
Incidentally, I went
and saw the old man,

27:49.135 --> 27:50.870
after you and I
were speaking on Saturday.

27:50.937 --> 27:53.105
Oh, Christ, Phillip.
I'm sorry.
No, no, no. Shut up.

27:53.172 --> 27:55.507
It's all good.
No, I'm--
I'm really, really sorry.

27:55.574 --> 27:58.310
He's fine. He's fine.
Honestly, he's fine.
Right.

27:58.377 --> 28:02.448
[bird cooing]

28:02.514 --> 28:05.818
Something interesting
happened today.
[computer whirs]

28:05.885 --> 28:09.388
-You don't know what
an error 101 is, do you?
-It's semi-related.

28:09.455 --> 28:15.261
Um... I thought
I got a phone call
from my mum on Saturday.

28:15.327 --> 28:17.764
-Your mother?
Well, that would be, uh--
-Mm.

28:17.830 --> 28:20.332
Didn't your mum--
Yeah, late last year.

28:20.399 --> 28:23.469
Pass away.
Yeah, I remember you saying.
Cervical cancer.

28:23.535 --> 28:26.338
Yeah, that'd do it.

28:26.405 --> 28:28.307
And?
No, it was just--

28:29.575 --> 28:31.443
It was just a wrong number.

28:31.510 --> 28:35.247
And?
And I thought it was her.

28:35.314 --> 28:37.549
Your mum?
Mm.

28:37.616 --> 28:40.252
The dead one?
No.

28:40.319 --> 28:43.189
It was just a wrong number.
Yeah, you said.

28:43.255 --> 28:46.458
I just wasn't sure and,
you know, she sounded like...

28:49.161 --> 28:51.130
she might be
an interesting person.

28:51.197 --> 28:55.501
Just excuse me, Frank.
I'm sorry to do this to you.
I will have to take this. Hello.

28:55.567 --> 28:56.903
Yes, he's right here now.

28:56.969 --> 28:59.505
Certainly.
It's for you, Frank.

28:59.571 --> 29:01.473
Who is it?
It's Freud.

29:02.909 --> 29:06.078
He says it's urgent.
Tell him I'll call him back.

29:07.213 --> 29:10.182
There's a tone of concern
in his voice, Frank.

29:10.249 --> 29:11.750
Right.

29:14.220 --> 29:16.989
Okay, yes, Vienna.
How many bedrooms?

29:17.056 --> 29:19.826
Is he all right?
I don't know.

29:19.892 --> 29:23.129
He saw his old man
on the weekend.
No, otherwise.

29:23.195 --> 29:25.231
[phone rings]
How would I know?

29:26.165 --> 29:27.800
[phone rings]
How are you?

29:27.867 --> 29:30.069
[Frank] How do you mean?
[Olivia] Are you okay?

29:30.136 --> 29:33.873
Yeah, I'm fine.
You haven't said anything
about my hair.

29:34.974 --> 29:36.508
[phone rings]
No, I haven't.

29:38.344 --> 29:40.312
[phone rings]
Oh, it'll look good
when it's finished.

29:41.613 --> 29:44.083
-Phillip said
you might be in a mood.
-No, I like it.

29:44.150 --> 29:47.186
I have to take these.
Sure.

29:47.253 --> 29:50.089
-Phillip Lang Real Estate.
How can I help you?
-[Phillip] Frank?

29:50.156 --> 29:52.091
I'm afraid he's
in a meeting at the moment.
Phillip.

29:52.158 --> 29:53.525
Take a message?
Lunch.

29:53.592 --> 29:55.995
[clears throat]
It's lunchtime.

29:56.062 --> 29:58.898
Okay, no problem.
Is that 4:00?

30:00.699 --> 30:02.301
[Phillip]
Please follow the guard.

30:02.368 --> 30:04.770
[birds chirping]

30:04.837 --> 30:06.338
[clears throat, sniffs]

30:07.739 --> 30:09.408
Really?

30:09.475 --> 30:12.511
You're complaining about
I'm coughing and you're
on a flight path?

30:12.578 --> 30:15.147
Just hit the ball.
[airplane passing overhead]

30:23.289 --> 30:25.324
That's good.
Never had a lesson.
Can you believe that?

30:25.391 --> 30:29.328
No. I'm happy to sign
an affidavit saying I saw that.
[laughs]

30:29.395 --> 30:31.197
Are there any
downhill holes here?

30:31.263 --> 30:33.565
Yeah, this one,
but you gotta go
the other way.

30:35.234 --> 30:36.869
Oh you're joking,
aren't you, Frank.

30:36.936 --> 30:39.071
You're very funny.
Oh, come on. Have a go.

30:39.138 --> 30:43.142
-You're being facetious.
-Nah, I'm being optimistic.
I have faith in you, mate.

30:43.209 --> 30:45.912
Freud and I were just
discussing your mother again.

30:45.978 --> 30:47.679
He thinks you should
take the day off.

30:47.746 --> 30:50.182
Not suggesting for a moment
that's not what you're doing,

30:50.249 --> 30:52.684
but could you do something
sensible at some point?

30:52.751 --> 30:56.122
-Why don't you go
and see your dead mother?
-Oh, righto.

30:56.188 --> 30:59.191
Now shut up.
I'm out here to relax.

31:01.493 --> 31:05.631
Oh, how very relaxing.
I feel much better now.

31:05.697 --> 31:10.136
You know, every time you walk
in the room lately, I can hear
your theme music.

31:10.202 --> 31:14.873
It's not a bad life, Frank,
being an agent.

31:14.941 --> 31:17.476
We stand in the middle
of an economic equation

31:17.543 --> 31:20.512
adding to the price of something
without producing it.

31:20.579 --> 31:23.815
We show people houses they like
and we explain to them
why they like it.

31:23.882 --> 31:26.852
If they don't like it, we've got
another one we're desperate
to show them

31:26.919 --> 31:29.688
that we think might
suit them better.

31:29.755 --> 31:34.426
We're probably a by-product
of the bloody divorce industry.

31:34.493 --> 31:37.496
Somebody's life's
not going terribly well,
it's good news for us.

31:38.897 --> 31:41.934
Not the most difficult work
in the world.

31:42.001 --> 31:44.903
[Frank narrating]
28 MacLan Avenue, St. Marys.

31:46.205 --> 31:49.241
Attractive Tudor style home
on a good size allotment.

31:49.308 --> 31:50.977
[rings]

31:57.616 --> 32:01.520
Solid brick,
wide double-frontage verandah.

32:02.688 --> 32:03.622
[sighs]

32:07.593 --> 32:10.162
Quiet tree-lined street,

32:10.229 --> 32:12.364
set in an attractive
garden setting.

32:13.665 --> 32:15.034
[door opens]

32:20.239 --> 32:24.143
-I'm Frank.
-You must be. Come in, please.

32:26.378 --> 32:29.148
Greet--
I'm sorry about the mess.

32:29.215 --> 32:30.983
Oh, no, it's fine.
I understand.

32:31.050 --> 32:34.886
Greet, gree--
gr-- g--

32:34.953 --> 32:38.457
Now sound it out, dear.
Gr-ie-f.

32:38.524 --> 32:43.295
Yes, that's good.
"Said the goose.
Well, well, said the pig."

32:43.362 --> 32:46.565
That's very good, Omar.
You've done very well today.

32:48.067 --> 32:49.768
Now, off you pop.

32:49.835 --> 32:55.407
Take your books
and I will give you--
[grunts]

32:55.474 --> 32:57.909
Now this is your reader
for next week.

32:57.976 --> 33:00.279
Here you go, miss.
Oh, thank you.

33:00.346 --> 33:03.982
Oh, this is all about
how English was invented.

33:04.050 --> 33:06.852
Yes, it's about
where English was invented.

33:06.918 --> 33:08.820
Off you go.
Thank you, miss.

33:08.887 --> 33:11.090
Same time next Monday.

33:13.792 --> 33:16.795
Well, I-I've had the kettle on.
I'll make us some tea, shall I?

33:16.862 --> 33:18.630
Mm, sure.

33:20.066 --> 33:22.601
[Frank narrating]
Well proportioned
light-filled entranceway

33:22.668 --> 33:26.105
leads to spacious hallway
with original features.

33:26.172 --> 33:30.176
Generously proportioned
living room with north-facing
leadlight windows,

33:30.242 --> 33:33.812
art-deco ceiling fixtures,
gas heating and--

33:33.879 --> 33:35.381
Oh, hello.

33:59.505 --> 34:03.409
I think it's about 15-by-12
in the old money.

34:04.210 --> 34:06.645
Sorry. Force of habit.

34:06.712 --> 34:09.514
[inhales, sighs]

34:16.822 --> 34:19.056
You must be an incredibly
gifted kleptomaniac,

34:19.125 --> 34:22.261
or your fines from the library
are worth more than this house.

34:22.328 --> 34:25.197
[chuckles]
These are all mine.

34:25.264 --> 34:27.998
I used to work
in the state library, 30 years.

34:28.065 --> 34:30.835
Now I can't bare to see
a book out of place.

34:30.902 --> 34:33.905
Oh, it's so silly really,
you know, because I go
into other people's houses

34:33.972 --> 34:37.409
and I, you know,
I might see a book that's
lying on an occasional table.

34:37.476 --> 34:39.277
I get quite short-tempered.

34:39.344 --> 34:41.213
Mm.

34:41.280 --> 34:44.716
I straighten pictures,
plan reno's.

34:46.452 --> 34:49.487
I was thinking
of doing something
like this to my place.

34:49.554 --> 34:50.822
Hmm.

34:55.726 --> 34:57.829
What's he do?
Who?

34:59.165 --> 35:04.203
Oh, Damien. Oh, he's in--
he's in HR, IT or--

35:04.270 --> 35:08.073
To tell you the truth,
I don't honestly know,
but I-I know it's an acronym.

35:08.140 --> 35:12.144
Something to do with computers,
and I believe he does
quite well out of it.

35:12.211 --> 35:15.181
-Now, do you take milk?
-Oh, yes, thank you.

35:16.415 --> 35:18.884
[sighs]
And sugar?

35:18.950 --> 35:20.586
Yeah, just one.

35:28.026 --> 35:29.661
Force of habit... again.

35:29.728 --> 35:32.398
How long have you been--
Eight months.

35:32.464 --> 35:35.467
It's not really panning out.
I mean--

35:36.402 --> 35:39.271
We get on better,

35:39.338 --> 35:42.073
you know, um,
than when we were married.

35:42.140 --> 35:45.644
-I'm sorry to hear that.
-No, it's all right. I mean,
we're working through it.

35:45.711 --> 35:50.649
[sighs] I'm sorry,
because I know this
is none of my business,

35:50.716 --> 35:52.651
but if you're
still getting on, why--

35:52.718 --> 35:55.854
Well, I mean,
it's not anything--

35:57.556 --> 36:00.692
It's not anything
specific really.

36:00.759 --> 36:02.594
It's just, um--

36:05.163 --> 36:09.568
She suddenly got famous
and, it was, you know,
it was quite shocking.

36:09.635 --> 36:12.538
She's an actor,
so we didn't really think
it was going anywhere.

36:12.604 --> 36:16.275
Everything was fine
when she was doing co-op.

36:16.342 --> 36:19.345
You know,
those magical-realist plays

36:19.411 --> 36:22.248
from South America
with a talking cat.
Mm.

36:24.182 --> 36:27.353
Now she's got 220,000 followers
on Twitter.

36:27.419 --> 36:31.022
Oh, wow.
Would I know of her,
do you think?

36:31.089 --> 36:34.593
I dunno.
Do you watch Major Surgery?

36:34.660 --> 36:38.730
It's not--
It's not Wendy McKinnon?

36:38.797 --> 36:39.698
Yeah.

36:39.765 --> 36:42.668
Oh, well, they say
she's wonderful.

36:42.734 --> 36:45.804
Yeah. I recently heard
her work described
as fairly accurate.

36:48.139 --> 36:50.709
And what do you do, Frank,
if you don't mind my asking?

36:52.678 --> 36:54.580
[clears throat]
I'm retired.

36:54.646 --> 36:58.083
-Really?
-I invented Tetris.

36:58.149 --> 37:01.119
Right.
I also model. Menswear mainly.

37:01.186 --> 37:02.421
Mm.

37:04.022 --> 37:08.794
And, uh, right now,
I am... doing volunteer work

37:08.860 --> 37:11.430
for an impoverished Realtor
in Unley.

37:12.464 --> 37:14.800
-There we are.
-Mm.

37:14.866 --> 37:17.903
Force of habit again.

37:17.969 --> 37:20.339
I don't like to say
that I work in real estate.

37:21.607 --> 37:24.142
Not 'cause it's evil,
there's no argument there.

37:24.209 --> 37:26.312
But it's just
every time I say it,

37:26.378 --> 37:30.682
someone always says
"0h, so what's this place worth,
you reckon?"

37:30.749 --> 37:32.451
Right.

37:33.452 --> 37:35.787
-So what--
-Mid-fives to early sixes.

37:37.489 --> 37:40.959
-600 thousand for this place?
-Yes. 650 on a good day.

37:41.026 --> 37:44.296
But I-I thought after
the recession that--
Yeah, well, you know.

37:44.363 --> 37:46.732
Everybody's scared
of the stock market

37:46.798 --> 37:49.901
and cash is getting silly,
so bricks and mortar.

37:49.968 --> 37:51.770
It's the best place
to park your money.

37:51.837 --> 37:55.507
-Oh, I thought everybody
had lost their money.
-Mm, the normals.

37:56.408 --> 37:58.610
But who did they lose it to?

38:00.245 --> 38:04.049
The investors.
They can still call
the Queen their auntie.

38:05.250 --> 38:06.952
But all the papers say--

38:07.018 --> 38:09.421
You don't believe what you read
in the papers, do you?

38:09.488 --> 38:13.359
Money never goes away.
It just changes hands.

38:17.128 --> 38:20.399
Thanks for the tea.
No, no. Thank you
for coming all this way.

38:20.466 --> 38:23.835
Oh, it's not a problem.
We're calling this
an inner suburb these days.

38:25.537 --> 38:27.406
Well, good-bye.

38:29.808 --> 38:31.042
Right.

38:31.943 --> 38:33.679
Thanks for the tea.

38:33.745 --> 38:35.814
Oh, um, while I think about it,

38:35.881 --> 38:37.649
somebody's turned your mat
upside down.

38:37.716 --> 38:40.318
Oh, no, it's meant
to be like that.
No, no, it's meant to--

38:40.386 --> 38:43.789
Come here and I'll show you.
Come on.

38:47.225 --> 38:51.029
Now stand there and look.
Look down.

38:54.366 --> 38:56.668
Now look up.

38:59.204 --> 39:00.972
What do you see?

39:04.175 --> 39:06.111
I don't know.

39:06.177 --> 39:07.546
Um--

39:09.848 --> 39:11.216
A street?
[bicycle bell clangs]

39:11.282 --> 39:15.854
[chattering]

39:17.989 --> 39:19.090
[woman] Welcome.

39:25.531 --> 39:27.365
Thanks for the tea.

39:34.640 --> 39:37.543
[Frank narrating]
Established garden setting
with bright sunny outlook

39:37.609 --> 39:41.112
onto one of the area's
most distinctive avenues.

39:41.179 --> 39:44.783
This well-presented
property boasts easy access
to local amenities,

39:44.850 --> 39:47.553
including attractive parks
and gardens.

39:50.021 --> 39:53.391
Don't let this opportunity
pass you by.
[car beeping]

40:02.100 --> 40:03.469
[rings]

40:08.807 --> 40:10.742
Did you leave something?
No.

40:12.077 --> 40:14.880
I just wanted to ask
if we could, um--

40:15.881 --> 40:18.183
You know, if we could
do this again?

40:18.249 --> 40:21.453
I don't really feel like
I got the chance to apologize
for the other night and--

40:21.520 --> 40:23.221
You seem perfectly--

40:23.288 --> 40:26.858
No, can we please
just not talk about that.
I just want to-- I mean--

40:26.925 --> 40:29.995
Frank.
No, no, look, it's coming.

40:30.061 --> 40:31.429
Frank.
No, I've got it.

40:31.497 --> 40:34.265
Would you like to come round
to lunch on Sunday?

40:34.332 --> 40:35.767
I will do a roast.

40:38.203 --> 40:40.872
Terrific. Um--

40:42.207 --> 40:45.644
Should I bring something?
No. Just bring yourself.

40:47.579 --> 40:48.980
Good.
Right.

40:49.047 --> 40:50.649
1:00.
Right. Righto.

40:50.716 --> 40:53.118
1:00. Sunday.
[chuckles]

40:53.184 --> 40:55.554
All right.
1300 hours.

40:56.622 --> 40:58.990
Roger that. Lunch.

41:01.026 --> 41:02.928
[man on radio]
Sorry, caller two,
that's not right.

41:02.994 --> 41:05.396
Caller three,
look, what do you think
the secret sound is?

41:05.463 --> 41:08.600
[woman on radio]
Oh, it's the sound
of someone hissing?

41:08.667 --> 41:11.603
I mean it. I really thought
that you found a moment there.
Oh, good.

41:11.670 --> 41:13.304
Really strong.
Thanks, Gary.

41:13.371 --> 41:15.373
Wonderful energy.

41:15.440 --> 41:18.810
Maybe you could try
an accent or something
in the next scene.

41:18.877 --> 41:20.979
Oh, all right.
Meryl Streep.
You look like Meryl Streep.

41:21.046 --> 41:22.714
I do not.
Yes.

41:22.781 --> 41:24.850
Excuse me. Can I talk to you
for a minute, please?

41:24.916 --> 41:26.785
[chattering]
You work here?

41:26.852 --> 41:28.620
[woman]
Is there a problem?

41:28.687 --> 41:32.223
[Frank] I wanna see
the safety adviser right now.

41:32.290 --> 41:35.326
There must be someone
from 0.H. & S. here.
Go get em. Go.

41:35.393 --> 41:37.796
Right now.
Go get 'em. Stat!

41:37.863 --> 41:41.199
Bring me a safety helmet
and some safety vests as well.

41:42.901 --> 41:46.171
[chattering]

41:46.237 --> 41:47.673
Meryl Streep.
Oh.

41:47.739 --> 41:49.908
I had a farm in Africa.

41:49.975 --> 41:52.778
Put this on.
Could you get me a bigger size?

41:52.844 --> 41:54.880
Sorry. Sorry, Gary,
what were you were saying?

41:54.946 --> 41:58.684
Well, what I'm saying is
that I really think you should
consider moving to London.

41:58.750 --> 42:02.320
It's great. It's expensive,
but it's a nice place.
I've got a little spot--

42:02.387 --> 42:03.922
Thanks, darling. That's good.

42:03.989 --> 42:06.357
-There's plenty of work
on the West End.
-That's great.

42:06.424 --> 42:08.093
It'd be great
and they'd love you.

42:08.159 --> 42:11.129
There should be cones
around the cones.

42:12.097 --> 42:15.466
Excuse me, Gary,
just one second.

42:15.533 --> 42:18.870
[Gary] You know, it wasn't--
it wasn't Meryl Streep.
It was Halle Berry.

42:18.937 --> 42:21.907
What I'm trying to say
is the cones are there
for your own safety.

42:21.973 --> 42:24.075
Oh, here's my little ingenue.

42:25.911 --> 42:28.346
Right.
Every day from now on.

42:28.413 --> 42:30.348
One of these. Hard hat.

42:30.415 --> 42:34.052
[bell rings]
[sighs]

42:34.119 --> 42:36.688
You have to stop pulling
this stuff on the crew, Frank.

42:36.755 --> 42:40.291
Why? They assume
that anybody that walks in here
in a suit's from the network

42:40.358 --> 42:41.492
and this is
from Fletcher Jones.

42:41.559 --> 42:43.094
Give that to Gary, will you?

42:43.161 --> 42:45.530
Anyway, you used to dig it
when I used to do it.

42:45.597 --> 42:47.432
Yeah, well,
this isn't the old days.

42:47.498 --> 42:49.735
[Sighs]
Maybe not for you.

42:51.036 --> 42:52.838
They're just trying
to do their jobs.
Thanks, Wendy.

42:52.904 --> 42:55.373
Yes, bringing joy
and hope to millions.

42:55.440 --> 42:59.544
Huh, well, at least
they make something
that didn't exist once.

42:59.611 --> 43:02.347
You sell what's already there.
You're in no position to judge.

43:02.413 --> 43:04.750
All right.
Fair play. Sorry.

43:04.816 --> 43:06.785
See, that's the trouble
with you, Frank.

43:06.852 --> 43:10.822
You'd much rather apologize
afterwards than be reasonable
beforehand.

43:10.889 --> 43:13.058
I mean, what's with you?
What do you mean? I'm fine.

43:13.124 --> 43:16.294
Exactly. Why are you
in such a good mood?

43:16.361 --> 43:18.997
FYI, I've done some research.

43:19.064 --> 43:22.067
People don't actually
say "stat" in Australia.

43:23.702 --> 43:27.305
What's, uh, Gary doing here?
Oh, he doesn't have to go
till Thursday now.

43:27.372 --> 43:31.176
What's he doing in London?
Nothing. Just panto
to clear a tax debt.

43:31.242 --> 43:33.311
Oh, no, he isn't!

43:33.378 --> 43:35.113
Hi, Wendy.

43:35.180 --> 43:37.482
You're not seeing anyone,
are you?

43:37.548 --> 43:39.217
No.

43:39.284 --> 43:41.019
It'd be fine if you are.

43:41.086 --> 43:44.155
Right.
And how isn't it fine?

43:44.222 --> 43:46.224
Oh, don't get prickly.

43:46.291 --> 43:49.360
I'm just saying you're acting
like you got a leg over.

43:49.427 --> 43:51.596
It would be fantastic
if you had, to be honest.

43:51.663 --> 43:57.435
Not just for me,
for society as a whole.
[workers chattering]

43:57.502 --> 43:58.937
Oh, shit.
You gotta be there in 10.

43:59.004 --> 44:01.740
Uh, righto.
Ah, Frank?

44:02.774 --> 44:05.911
Be nice. Please.
Righto.

44:07.412 --> 44:08.980
To who?

44:19.257 --> 44:21.259
[chattering]

44:23.528 --> 44:25.163
[car beeping]

44:30.335 --> 44:32.637
They started already.
Oh, sorry, mate.

44:32.704 --> 44:34.706
Mum didn't tell me
till an hour ago.

44:34.773 --> 44:37.442
You're lucky
I had nothing on.
Like what?

44:44.315 --> 44:46.151
[man]
Cue the storm.

44:46.217 --> 44:48.787
[thunderclap]

44:48.854 --> 44:50.956
Line?
[man] "Who's there, besides--"

44:51.022 --> 44:53.258
Who's there, besides--

44:53.324 --> 44:55.060
Foul--
Foul weather.

44:55.126 --> 44:58.429
[Frank Jr.]
One minded like the weather,
most unquietly.

45:02.467 --> 45:05.937
Sorry. Line?
"I know you. Where's the king?"

45:06.004 --> 45:08.006
I know you.
Where's the king?

45:08.073 --> 45:10.075
Contending with
the fretful elements.

45:10.141 --> 45:12.277
Bids the earth blow into--
Wind.

45:12.343 --> 45:14.712
Bids the wind blow the earth
into the sea,

45:14.780 --> 45:17.348
or swell the curled waters
above the main.

45:17.415 --> 45:20.886
That things might cease.
Tears his white hair,

45:20.952 --> 45:23.588
which the impetuous blasts,
with eyeless rage,

45:23.654 --> 45:26.257
catch their fury
and make nothing of.

45:26.324 --> 45:28.393
Strives in his
little world of man

45:28.459 --> 45:32.230
to outscorn the to-and-fro
conflicting wind and rain.

45:32.297 --> 45:37.702
Wherein the cub-drawn bear
would couch, the lion
and the belly-pinched wolf

45:37.769 --> 45:41.506
keep their fur dry,
unbonneted he runs

45:41.572 --> 45:44.409
and bids what will take all.

45:44.475 --> 45:47.145
[hammering]

45:47.212 --> 45:49.815
Line?
"But who is with him."

45:49.881 --> 45:52.617
But who is with him?
Sorry.

45:52.683 --> 45:57.956
None but the fool,
who labors to out-jest
his heart-struck injuries.

45:59.757 --> 46:01.359
[clicks teeth]

46:03.528 --> 46:06.832
[birds cooing]

46:13.071 --> 46:15.506
[Frank] How's your arm?
[Frank Jr.] Good.

46:21.712 --> 46:24.115
How's school?
Good.

46:26.952 --> 46:30.588
[turn signal clicking]

46:30.655 --> 46:33.258
I spy, with my little eye...

46:34.059 --> 46:36.862
something starting with W.

46:37.929 --> 46:39.497
Windscreen.

46:40.798 --> 46:42.367
Yeah, all right. Fair enough.

46:42.433 --> 46:45.503
Um, your turn.

46:45.570 --> 46:48.073
Something starting with E.

46:49.674 --> 46:51.009
Edwardian villa?

46:51.076 --> 46:53.011
No.

46:53.078 --> 46:55.680
Eastern suburbs?
No.

46:55.746 --> 46:59.250
All right, I give up.
Estranged husband.

47:05.523 --> 47:09.160
[Frank narrating]
67 Dalkieth Avenue, Hyde Park.

47:09.227 --> 47:13.031
Untouched period charm
in sought-after location.

47:13.098 --> 47:14.866
Generously proportioned rooms

47:14.933 --> 47:18.870
characterize the appeal
of this late-Victorian
villa-style home

47:18.937 --> 47:21.306
with original features.

47:21.372 --> 47:24.509
This meticulously renovated
family home

47:24.575 --> 47:26.677
is ideal for entertainment

47:26.744 --> 47:31.082
and is a short walk
from a prestige retail
and vibrant café district.

47:31.149 --> 47:33.551
You're not coming in, are you?

47:33.618 --> 47:38.289
No, I just wanted
to take a quick squiz
at the guttering.

47:49.300 --> 47:51.302
It looks fine.
What's she on about?

47:51.369 --> 47:54.872
Duh. She had it fixed
by some men.

47:59.010 --> 48:00.611
I'll talk to you later.

48:02.447 --> 48:05.516
[Frank narrating]
The property also boasts
recently refurbished guttering.

48:09.187 --> 48:13.324
[dial tone, line ringing]

48:13.391 --> 48:15.060
Hi, you've reached
Wendy McKinnon.

48:15.126 --> 48:18.763
Please leave a message after
the beep and I'll get back
to you as soon as I can.

48:18.829 --> 48:20.498
[beep]

48:20.565 --> 48:22.567
Uh, hi. It's me.

48:22.633 --> 48:27.272
Um-- I, uh--

48:28.406 --> 48:31.776
I just finished watching
Frank Jr. rehearsing,

48:31.842 --> 48:33.711
and um--

48:33.778 --> 48:35.513
he's, um--

48:37.482 --> 48:40.285
Look, I-I think
we should talk maybe.

48:40.351 --> 48:43.021
Um, he's--

48:45.823 --> 48:49.394
[sighs]
Um... he's home.

48:50.428 --> 48:53.831
He's fine and, um,
the gutters look good.

48:53.898 --> 48:57.468
Um... okay.

48:58.369 --> 49:00.005
Talk later.

49:03.308 --> 49:05.410
Uh, it's Frank, by the way.
[voice mail beeps]

49:08.546 --> 49:10.315
[phone beeps]

49:13.818 --> 49:18.956
[cell phone ringing]

49:20.125 --> 49:23.428
Yep?
[Wendy] All right.
What's happened?

49:23.494 --> 49:24.495
Nothing. Why?

49:24.562 --> 49:27.365
Is he all right?
Yeah, he's fine.

49:27.432 --> 49:30.368
What happened?
Nothing.

49:30.435 --> 49:32.137
So what's with
the "we should talk"?

49:32.203 --> 49:33.871
What?
You left a message.

49:33.938 --> 49:35.640
You're like,
"It's Frank. We should talk".

49:35.706 --> 49:38.909
Oh, oh, oh, yeah.

49:38.976 --> 49:41.612
Um--
Just tell me he's all right.

49:41.679 --> 49:43.814
He's fine.

49:43.881 --> 49:45.983
You know, uh, sorry.

49:47.018 --> 49:49.054
I was just watching him

49:49.120 --> 49:52.390
at rehearsal and...
he's good.

49:52.457 --> 49:54.325
Sorry?
He's-- He's good.

49:54.392 --> 49:57.028
He's, um, he's talented,
you know,

49:57.095 --> 50:00.731
at, uh, at acting.

50:04.502 --> 50:06.937
And I was just wondering
if we should do something
about that.

50:07.004 --> 50:09.374
[chattering]

50:09.440 --> 50:11.709
Well, did you tell him?
What?

50:11.776 --> 50:14.179
Are you kidding?
No, you don't tell them
things like that.

50:15.480 --> 50:19.384
I mean, should we send him
to one of those special schools?

50:20.851 --> 50:22.453
Frank, I'll talk to you later.

50:22.520 --> 50:24.455
No, hang on.
You know what I mean.

50:24.522 --> 50:26.624
One of those schools
for kids who can't play footy.

50:27.292 --> 50:28.759
[cell phone beeps]

50:34.265 --> 50:36.634
[Frank Narrating]
Eighteen Waltham Street,
Prospect.

50:36.701 --> 50:41.339
Mortgagee auction,
with period charm,
excellent floor plan,

50:41.406 --> 50:43.841
secure parking at the rear.

50:43.908 --> 50:46.811
Subject to council approval.

50:46.877 --> 50:50.047
This home will excite
the discerning inner-city buyer

50:50.115 --> 50:53.218
looking for convenience
and style.

50:54.419 --> 50:58.189
Central bathroom,
gas heating and appliances.

50:58.256 --> 51:01.058
North-facing rear garden,
ideal--

51:01.126 --> 51:03.828
Looks like
a deceased estate.

51:03.894 --> 51:07.665
Why? Did you find the body?
We looked everywhere for it.

51:08.566 --> 51:10.668
Well, if it is
a deceased estate,

51:10.735 --> 51:13.404
why does it say
"mortgagee auction"
on the board?

51:14.972 --> 51:18.843
Well, the mortgagee
is deceased. I believe
that's why she's selling.

51:18.909 --> 51:21.446
[man]
Excuse me, mate. Sorry.

51:21.512 --> 51:23.314
[Frank]
Excuse me for a sec, mate.

51:25.516 --> 51:30.688
Um, not to be rude,
but this isn't
in your price range.

51:30.755 --> 51:34.259
Yeah, well,
but it's listed here as--
Yeah, I know what it says.

51:34.325 --> 51:35.693
I put it there.

51:41.732 --> 51:43.268
[baby mumbles]

51:49.039 --> 51:50.208
[door closes]

51:55.045 --> 51:56.581
[chuckles]

52:05.156 --> 52:06.724
Oh, wow.

52:09.494 --> 52:13.464
[doorbell rings]
Oh, at last.
I'm so sorry, Frank.

52:15.966 --> 52:18.936
[door opens]
Oh, good Lord,
no wonder you're late.

52:19.003 --> 52:22.240
Look at you, all handsome.
[man] I didn't wear this
for you, Mum. It's Anzac Day.

52:22.307 --> 52:25.443
Oh, don't be silly.
I know that.

52:25.510 --> 52:29.480
How was it?
Oh, it was pretty good.
Same as last year.

52:30.248 --> 52:32.417
Oh. Hello.

52:32.483 --> 52:34.952
Frank, this is Damien.
Damien, Frank.

52:35.019 --> 52:36.487
G'day.

52:39.357 --> 52:43.794
Now, I'll take that.
Sit down and I'll serve up
before it gets cold.

52:46.831 --> 52:48.633
That looks pretty swish.

52:53.238 --> 52:54.672
Thanks, Mum.

53:16.361 --> 53:18.629
[silverware clanging]

53:29.139 --> 53:31.676
[slurps, sighs]

53:32.877 --> 53:34.912
[slurps] Mmm.

53:34.979 --> 53:38.683
[sighs] It's better than
the bully, eh, Phillip, eh?

53:38.749 --> 53:43.053
You tell 'em it's from me.
There's plenty more
where that came from.

53:43.120 --> 53:46.424
Hmm, it was better
than the bully.

53:46.491 --> 53:49.159
The tins aren't rusty
like the other ones, eh?

53:49.226 --> 53:51.662
Yeah, eat up, mate. Shush.

53:51.729 --> 53:53.898
Mm. [sniffles]

53:53.964 --> 53:55.966
[people chattering]

53:56.033 --> 53:58.503
Mmm. [sighs]

53:58.569 --> 54:00.871
You love that, don't you?
Ah, yeah. It's good.

54:16.220 --> 54:17.355
Um--

54:19.390 --> 54:21.626
Sarah tells me
that you're in IT?

54:23.294 --> 54:27.598
That's right, yeah.
I run IT for the HR department
at the RAAF.

54:27.665 --> 54:32.370
Oh... okay. I see.
CPU's?

54:35.172 --> 54:36.907
Well, yeah, yeah,
that's correct.

54:36.974 --> 54:40.978
Um, we maintain a virtualized
data center cluster,

54:41.045 --> 54:43.548
with high bandwidth off-site
replication for redundancy.

54:44.615 --> 54:46.751
Spin up VM's when the I/0's
get out of spec,

54:46.817 --> 54:49.854
which could be from
either our intranet
or Internet hosted web apps.

54:49.920 --> 54:53.991
Um, we've got to watch out
for SNMP traps that target
our 5-9's uptime SLA.

54:54.058 --> 54:56.694
And, of course,
obviously, I mean,
security is a big issue,

54:56.761 --> 54:58.729
so we, uh, we dig
through lines of code

54:58.796 --> 55:01.766
to check for possible
SQL injection exploits.
[inhales]

55:05.870 --> 55:07.372
What about you, Frank?

55:08.439 --> 55:09.907
I'm in real estate.

55:10.741 --> 55:12.377
Right.

55:14.712 --> 55:16.046
So, um...

55:17.281 --> 55:19.016
what's this place worth,
do you reckon?

55:23.988 --> 55:26.657
Mum, where are the--
where are the--
No, no, it goes in there.

55:27.558 --> 55:29.927
It used to be in there.
[chuckles]

55:32.797 --> 55:35.332
Sarah, um,
I can help if you want.

55:35.400 --> 55:38.636
If you've got another tea towel,
I could dry.
No, don't be silly.

55:38.703 --> 55:41.539
You're a guest.
Go and sit down.
Damien can do it.

55:53.551 --> 55:57.087
So, uh, I know you said
you met over the phone.

55:57.154 --> 56:00.090
I'm just still a little--
You must live in Linden Park.

56:01.091 --> 56:02.527
Um, Graham Street.

56:02.593 --> 56:05.596
Yeah, I'm around the corner
on Ostral.
Right, right.

56:05.663 --> 56:07.865
Yeah, and we have
similar phone numbers.

56:07.932 --> 56:10.668
And I think that the threes
and the sixes got turned around.

56:10.735 --> 56:13.070
I mean she was calling you,
but--
Uh-huh.

56:13.137 --> 56:15.406
She got me instead.
Right.

56:15.473 --> 56:18.976
And, um, you know,
we got to talking and--

56:19.043 --> 56:22.680
Yeah. When you say it out loud,
it does sound a little off-key.

56:22.747 --> 56:24.882
A little bit.
Yeah.

56:24.949 --> 56:27.418
-There's tea if you want it
when you finish.
-Thanks, Mum.

56:27.485 --> 56:30.755
And don't throw the butts
over the fence like
you usually do, Damien.

56:30.821 --> 56:33.458
It upsets
the tai chi ladies.

56:34.792 --> 56:36.994
0oh.

56:37.061 --> 56:38.496
Busted.

56:44.669 --> 56:47.004
Thanks for lunch.
My pleasure.

56:49.239 --> 56:50.641
Damien.

56:50.708 --> 56:52.443
Frank.

56:52.510 --> 56:56.213
Always nice to meet
a member of the armed forces,
especially in peacetime.

56:56.280 --> 56:57.648
Take care.

57:05.122 --> 57:06.657
Righto.

57:22.907 --> 57:24.775
[blade stops]

57:30.848 --> 57:32.817
Oh, mate!

57:32.883 --> 57:34.519
Can I touch it?
Of course you can.

57:34.585 --> 57:37.087
God! [exhales]

57:42.693 --> 57:44.228
[elevator bell dings]

57:47.397 --> 57:50.267
Sarah!
Fancy meeting you here.

57:50.334 --> 57:53.671
Everything okay?
Yes. Uh, well, no.

57:53.738 --> 57:57.107
I've just been
visiting a friend.
Oh, okay.

57:57.174 --> 58:00.444
Everything good, I hope.
She's quite unwell.

58:00.511 --> 58:02.680
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

58:06.083 --> 58:08.953
Oh, uh,
this is my son, Frank.
Frank.

58:09.019 --> 58:10.621
Hello.
Hello.

58:10.688 --> 58:14.158
Sorry about the smell.
It's his arm.

58:14.224 --> 58:17.494
It's like unpasteurized cheese
from the 19th century.

58:17.562 --> 58:21.566
Everything all right?
Oh, yes. Yes, I'm fine.

58:28.138 --> 58:29.940
[elevator whirs]

58:32.376 --> 58:33.778
[elevator bell dings]

58:38.315 --> 58:40.317
Sarah?

58:40.384 --> 58:42.319
Yes, Frank.

58:42.386 --> 58:45.455
Do you need a ride home
or something?
No, Frank.

58:45.522 --> 58:47.257
Thank you,
but I'll be fine.

58:57.401 --> 58:59.770
Who was that?
Huh?

58:59.837 --> 59:04.041
She's, uh-- She's a friend.

59:05.375 --> 59:07.011
Right.
She was a friend.

59:22.526 --> 59:25.963
Frank, I've been, um--

59:26.030 --> 59:29.066
I've been meaning
to tell you something.

59:29.133 --> 59:31.501
The, uh--

59:31.568 --> 59:34.605
The other day when
I was watching rehearsal--

59:34.672 --> 59:36.040
[zipper closes]

59:36.106 --> 59:38.609
I mean, the cast took me
out of it a little bit,

59:38.676 --> 59:41.011
took me out of the scene.

59:41.078 --> 59:43.580
I don't think
they had plaster of paris
in the Tudor period.

59:43.648 --> 59:45.883
I mean, you know,
they could have had some

59:45.950 --> 59:50.054
rudimentary splint arrangement,
I suppose.

59:50.120 --> 59:53.123
But look,
the point I was trying
to make is that--

59:53.190 --> 59:55.793
What I'm-- What I'm trying
to tell you is that...

59:56.526 --> 59:58.829
[beeping]
you're good.

59:59.964 --> 01:00:02.166
Well, you're really good.

01:00:02.232 --> 01:00:07.004
And I'll be honest,
I mean, you blew me away.

01:00:07.071 --> 01:00:11.375
And, um, you know,
I just think that you should--

01:00:11.441 --> 01:00:13.811
[sobbing]

01:00:13.878 --> 01:00:15.445
No, mate, don't cry.

01:00:15.512 --> 01:00:17.815
I mean, I wouldn't have
told you if you were gonna--

01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:22.653
[sighs]

01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:24.221
All right.

01:00:26.657 --> 01:00:29.226
All right.
[clears throat]

01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:31.896
Yeah, good talk.

01:00:31.962 --> 01:00:35.099
You all right, mate?
Yeah, I'm okay.

01:00:36.266 --> 01:00:39.737
[sighs]
Watch out for the cones.
[chuckles]

01:00:40.705 --> 01:00:42.606
[man] Ducks on the pond.
Ra-ta-ta-ta.

01:00:42.673 --> 01:00:44.775
G'day James.
Hello.

01:00:44.842 --> 01:00:47.244
[bell rings]
Oh, I'll see you tomorrow.

01:00:50.414 --> 01:00:52.116
Have you been crying?
No.

01:00:52.182 --> 01:00:55.152
What happened?
What have you done?
Nothing.

01:00:55.219 --> 01:00:57.254
What did you do?
What did he say to you?

01:00:57.321 --> 01:00:59.556
Nothing, I'm fine.
It's just hay fever.

01:00:59.623 --> 01:01:01.358
White with one,
Mr. Mollard.
Cheers.

01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:05.529
We should go.
Thanks for picking him up.

01:01:05.595 --> 01:01:08.733
[chattering]

01:01:13.570 --> 01:01:15.740

01:01:48.472 --> 01:01:50.040
[dial tone continues]

01:01:52.142 --> 01:01:53.443

[clock ticking]

01:02:07.424 --> 01:02:10.327
Frank? Oh.
Just passing.
I thought I'd pop in.

01:02:10.394 --> 01:02:12.462
I see. Uh--

01:02:14.264 --> 01:02:17.001
You're not an ambulance chaser,
are you, Frank?

01:02:17.067 --> 01:02:21.005
What? Who said that?
What, Damien?

01:02:21.071 --> 01:02:23.207
Well, he--
Well, we both were--

01:02:23.273 --> 01:02:26.476
We're a bit unsure
because you seem very nice.

01:02:26.543 --> 01:02:28.946
I'm finally having a good week.
J-Just give me his number.

01:02:29.013 --> 01:02:30.247
I'll call him.
No!

01:02:30.314 --> 01:02:33.017
No, a fucking ambulance chaser.
Give me his number.

01:02:33.083 --> 01:02:35.252
No, no. I don't want you
upsetting him.

01:02:35.319 --> 01:02:37.621
You said
he wasn't combat trained.
Frank, he is my son.

01:02:37.687 --> 01:02:39.924
Not you, him.

01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:42.426
Now, I-I know
what you've been doing,

01:02:42.492 --> 01:02:44.795
and up to now,
I've not seen any harm in it.

01:02:44.862 --> 01:02:50.334
But she's gone, Frank,
and it-- it doesn't matter
how nice you are to me.

01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:55.039
It doesn't change anything.
And no matter what you think
is wrong with you,

01:02:55.105 --> 01:02:58.876
you're just going to have
to fix that on your own.

01:02:58.943 --> 01:03:01.511
Because I'm not her.

01:03:01.578 --> 01:03:04.114
[clock chiming]
I'm not family.

01:03:06.750 --> 01:03:08.118
No, you're right.

01:03:11.922 --> 01:03:13.523
You're not.

01:03:19.997 --> 01:03:23.033
By the way,
your mat's upside down.

01:03:25.035 --> 01:03:28.405
[door closes]
Your mat is upside down!

01:03:31.541 --> 01:03:34.444
[woman on TV] Oh, my God!
He's gone into arrest!

01:03:34.511 --> 01:03:38.615
Forty milligrams
of adrenaline. Stat!

01:03:38.682 --> 01:03:40.684
Where's Dr. Mason?

01:03:40.750 --> 01:03:42.819
[phone rings]
[man on TV]
It's not going well.

01:03:42.887 --> 01:03:44.788
His BP and heart rate
are still falling.

01:03:44.855 --> 01:03:47.925
[woman] We need to get
some adrenaline in him now.
[man] Any more and we'll risk--

01:03:47.992 --> 01:03:51.228
[woman] Stat! Unless we stop
and defibrillate him--

Frank Mollard.

01:04:00.104 --> 01:04:02.339
[Sarah] It's me.

01:04:02.406 --> 01:04:03.941
Yep?

01:04:05.475 --> 01:04:10.114
I-I tried to call earlier,
but you weren't answering.

01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:11.916
No.

01:04:11.982 --> 01:04:15.385
[sighs]
Please don't be like this.

01:04:15.452 --> 01:04:19.456
I've rung to apologize.
It's okay.

01:04:22.059 --> 01:04:26.096
And I-I was wondering--
Mm-hmm.

01:04:28.365 --> 01:04:31.701
You see, I don't have
a driver's license and--

01:04:31.768 --> 01:04:36.406
Oh. Well, it's okay.
You can use mine.

[bird squawking]

01:04:48.785 --> 01:04:50.620
Let's have a squiz anyway.

Substantially sized allotment
in prime location,

01:04:57.894 --> 01:05:00.297
ideal for investors.

01:05:00.364 --> 01:05:05.702
Or create your own vision,
subject to council approval.

01:05:05.769 --> 01:05:08.138
Let your imagination run wild.

01:05:08.205 --> 01:05:11.341
The kitchen was here.

01:05:13.077 --> 01:05:15.679
And there were
always lovely smells.

01:05:15.745 --> 01:05:17.982
Well, she was always baking.

01:05:18.048 --> 01:05:20.184
My mum was always baking.

01:05:21.685 --> 01:05:25.922
And we had a lean-to... here.

01:05:27.457 --> 01:05:30.227
On hot summer nights,
they let me sleep
out on the daybed.

01:05:30.294 --> 01:05:34.698
And, oh, I'd be awake...
until all hours,

01:05:34.764 --> 01:05:36.900
counting the stars.

01:05:36.967 --> 01:05:38.568
[Frank] How many
were there back then?

01:05:38.635 --> 01:05:41.271
[chuckles] I don't think
I ever got that far.

01:05:41.338 --> 01:05:42.406
[chuckles]

01:05:45.175 --> 01:05:50.014
Oh, and there was
a wonderful nectarine tree here.

01:05:51.148 --> 01:05:55.652
And lavender and rosemary
all along the fence.

01:05:57.454 --> 01:06:00.157
I was always getting
stung by bees. [chuckles]

01:06:00.924 --> 01:06:04.494
[sighs]
Oh, dear.

01:06:04.561 --> 01:06:08.565
[sighs] It's so terrible
to see it like this.

01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:13.970
My father was very proud
it was a working garden.

01:06:15.172 --> 01:06:19.576
There was, um, a vine
he put in over there.

01:06:21.211 --> 01:06:24.614
That would be over
70 years old by now.

01:06:27.551 --> 01:06:29.186
[sighs]

01:06:30.420 --> 01:06:34.591
I thought it was bigger.
It always seemed bigger.

01:06:34.658 --> 01:06:38.995
Yeah, they always do.
[airplane passing overhead]

01:06:45.869 --> 01:06:47.337
Come on.

01:06:48.372 --> 01:06:50.340
Let's go see the next one.
Mm.

01:06:51.007 --> 01:06:52.642
You got-- Take my arm.

01:07:08.658 --> 01:07:12.362
with... scope
to further improve.
[car beeping]

01:07:13.230 --> 01:07:14.964
Thank you.
There you go.

01:07:15.031 --> 01:07:17.767
[rock music playing]

01:07:26.076 --> 01:07:28.445
[rock music continues]

01:07:28.512 --> 01:07:30.714
[Frank]
Is that a spruce or a fir?

01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:34.484
I think it's a Blue Cedar,
Cedrus atlantica.

01:07:34.551 --> 01:07:37.387
Look, I can, um,
look it up for you
when I get home.

01:07:39.923 --> 01:07:41.791
Let me do the talking.

01:07:49.032 --> 01:07:50.667
[music stops]

01:07:53.937 --> 01:07:55.639
Hey.
Hey.

01:07:55.705 --> 01:07:58.575
Frank Mollard.
Phillip Lang Real Estate. Card?

01:08:02.712 --> 01:08:04.281
You can keep that.

01:08:05.949 --> 01:08:09.119
Yeah, cool, man.
Yeah, nice font.

01:08:09.186 --> 01:08:11.288
Yeah, it's a serif.
Yeah.

01:08:13.357 --> 01:08:17.527
Yeah, um, we're actually
renting at the moment, so--
Yeah, keenly aware of that.

01:08:17.594 --> 01:08:20.564
Yeah, me and the cats were,
you know, we're rehearsing, so--

01:08:21.798 --> 01:08:23.800
That was you?
Yeah.

01:08:23.867 --> 01:08:27.470
Wow. I thought
you were spinning some vinyl.

01:08:27.537 --> 01:08:29.738
I thought it was like
Sly and the Family Stone.

01:08:29.805 --> 01:08:33.910
That's not, Sly, man.
[laughs, snorts] I wish.

01:08:33.977 --> 01:08:35.879
Anyway, back to me.
Sure.

01:08:35.944 --> 01:08:41.251
My, um, associate and I
are in the area today
and today only,

01:08:41.318 --> 01:08:44.087
to evaluate properties
that Phillip Lang Real Estate

01:08:44.154 --> 01:08:48.091
-has identified
as having potential.
-[rock music continues]

01:08:48.158 --> 01:08:51.895
Look, um,
let me be frank with you.

01:08:52.996 --> 01:08:55.198
-I need a name.
-Kyle.

01:08:55.265 --> 01:08:57.567
Kyle. Right, Kyle.

01:08:57.634 --> 01:08:59.603
Uh, my name's Frank.
Yeah, you said.

01:09:01.136 --> 01:09:03.473
Anyway I was just wondering
if we could--

01:09:03.540 --> 01:09:05.742
May we come in
and have a quick squiz?

01:09:07.377 --> 01:09:11.680
Um, yeah, yeah, sure.
Yeah, of course, yeah.

01:09:11.747 --> 01:09:13.283
Come on in.
Make yourself at home.

01:09:13.350 --> 01:09:15.018
Thank you.
No worries.

01:09:15.084 --> 01:09:17.621
We won't take much of your time.
Like five minutes or something.

01:09:17.687 --> 01:09:21.157
Well, I can give you the tour.
No, no, no, you jam.
We'll be right.

01:09:22.459 --> 01:09:26.196
Oh, I'm-- I'm sorry
to disturb you.
[drums playing]

01:09:26.263 --> 01:09:28.465
Hi.
All right.

01:09:28.532 --> 01:09:30.099
Yeah, no problem.
[Kyle] Let's get back into it.

01:09:30.166 --> 01:09:32.236
[man] Is that your dad?

01:09:32.301 --> 01:09:34.671
[Kyle] No, it's not my dad.

01:09:34.738 --> 01:09:36.340
[Frank narrating]
Light-filled entrance

01:09:36.406 --> 01:09:39.676
leads to spacious
kitchen and meals area.

01:09:39.743 --> 01:09:43.513
[Kyle] I don't know the guy.
Does he look like my dad?

01:09:43.580 --> 01:09:45.615
I remember these curtains.

01:09:48.885 --> 01:09:50.453
They're the same.

01:09:52.055 --> 01:09:53.923
They are the same curtains.

01:09:56.793 --> 01:10:00.264
[rock music continues]

01:10:21.618 --> 01:10:23.287
[sighs]

01:10:26.890 --> 01:10:28.558
Is it cancer?

01:10:31.695 --> 01:10:33.663
How long
did they give you?

01:10:38.468 --> 01:10:40.970
I can't think
of any other reason
that we'd be here.

01:10:43.873 --> 01:10:46.276
I'll be all right, Frank.
They say I'll be all right.

01:10:46.343 --> 01:10:49.045
That's not true.

01:10:49.112 --> 01:10:52.115
That's not based
on a true story.

01:10:52.181 --> 01:10:57.454
If they said that, we'd be
at the zoo looking at meerkats
and eating ice cream.

01:11:00.957 --> 01:11:05.395
I have a intercranial
cerebral aneurysm,

01:11:05.462 --> 01:11:07.030
and they can't--

01:11:08.264 --> 01:11:11.267
I don't know how long.
[band chattering]

01:11:11.335 --> 01:11:13.370
It's not as if
they give you a date.

01:11:15.705 --> 01:11:17.474
Damien know?

01:11:22.078 --> 01:11:24.013
He thinks
I'm just off-color.

01:11:24.914 --> 01:11:27.384
[inhales] Right.

01:11:28.852 --> 01:11:31.355
So he just thinks
that your hip is crook?

01:11:31.421 --> 01:11:35.024
[sighs]
No, that's not lying.

01:11:37.193 --> 01:11:40.330
But the hip
won't be done because--

01:11:40.397 --> 01:11:43.867
because of the aneurysm,
they can't give me
a general anesthetic.

01:11:43.933 --> 01:11:46.536
They daren't put me under
a general anesthetic.

01:11:51.375 --> 01:11:52.942
[sighs]

01:11:53.743 --> 01:11:54.678
Well...

01:11:56.946 --> 01:11:58.515
thanks for telling me.

01:11:58.582 --> 01:12:02.686
[rock playing]
[chattering]

01:12:09.025 --> 01:12:11.561
-[rock music playing]
-Oh, hey, man. Hey.

01:12:11.628 --> 01:12:13.697
Hey, Kyle.
Thanks very much.
Yeah, yeah. No worries.

01:12:13.763 --> 01:12:16.199
Really appreciate it.
Just hang on a sec.
Hang on a sec.

01:12:16.265 --> 01:12:19.736
Dude, where are
the Feb 15 demos?

01:12:19.803 --> 01:12:21.771
We'll just be off.
It's cool.
Check it out.

01:12:21.838 --> 01:12:22.806
Huh?

01:12:24.107 --> 01:12:26.476
Yeah. it's just like,
you know, like an EP.
Oh, good.

01:12:26.543 --> 01:12:27.911
Yeah, sort of like a, you know,

01:12:27.977 --> 01:12:30.313
between albums,
kind of limited release.
Right.

01:12:30.380 --> 01:12:32.749
Yeah, yeah, double A-side.
Right.

01:12:32.816 --> 01:12:34.784
We're going through
a transitional period.
Right.

01:12:34.851 --> 01:12:38.655
Shifting our influences
away from Miles, Pastorius,
toward funk.

01:12:38.722 --> 01:12:40.390
Mm. Rock is dead.
Yeah.

01:12:40.457 --> 01:12:42.258
Rock is dead.

01:12:42.325 --> 01:12:45.395
Long live
Paper Scissors.
Yeah.

01:12:45.462 --> 01:12:48.965
So, uh, what's this, uh--
what's the place worth,
do you reckon?

01:12:49.032 --> 01:12:50.233
Oh, this place?
Yeah.

01:12:50.299 --> 01:12:51.801
As it is?

01:12:51.868 --> 01:12:55.605
Uh, mostly
sentimental value.
Hmm.

01:12:55.672 --> 01:12:57.707
That's sweet.
Yeah.

01:12:57.774 --> 01:13:01.110
Yeah. All right.
Thanks, mate.
Yeah, no worries.

01:13:02.311 --> 01:13:05.181
Oh, and nice meeting you too,
uh, lady.

01:13:05.248 --> 01:13:07.584
Madame. Ma'am.
Thank you.

01:13:09.185 --> 01:13:11.120
[birds chirping]

01:13:11.955 --> 01:13:16.460
[rock music playing]

01:13:19.963 --> 01:13:22.566
God. How long
does this go on for?

01:13:22.632 --> 01:13:25.869
This track? 137 minutes.

01:13:30.907 --> 01:13:32.742
Frank,

01:13:32.809 --> 01:13:35.845
I'd be glad if you didn't
say anything to Damien.

01:13:37.481 --> 01:13:39.048
I know you wouldn't.

01:13:39.949 --> 01:13:43.186
[chuckles]
I feel silly asking.

01:13:46.790 --> 01:13:49.025
Would you like
to come in for a cuppa?

01:13:53.597 --> 01:13:55.599
What was she like?

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.302
Who? Mum?
Mm.

01:13:59.368 --> 01:14:01.771
[sighs]

01:14:04.708 --> 01:14:06.042
Old.

01:14:07.744 --> 01:14:09.879
Older than
she should have been.

01:14:12.248 --> 01:14:14.083
Disappointed.

01:14:14.150 --> 01:14:15.819
In what?

01:14:17.153 --> 01:14:20.356
Me. Dad.

01:14:20.423 --> 01:14:22.792
Herself, I suppose.

01:14:22.859 --> 01:14:24.561
Her life.

01:14:26.896 --> 01:14:28.898
[chuckles]

01:14:28.965 --> 01:14:31.835
She always smelled
of Taft hair spray.

01:14:34.170 --> 01:14:37.807
And she kept
a pharmacy of placebos
in her bedside drawer.

01:14:39.408 --> 01:14:42.579
She seemed to be
on hold two hours a day

01:14:42.646 --> 01:14:45.081
waiting to talk to somebody
at 5AA talkback.

01:14:46.916 --> 01:14:48.552
I remember...

01:14:50.386 --> 01:14:51.688
at Christmas,

01:14:53.422 --> 01:14:58.227
she would put as many
five-cent coins into my bit
of the pudding as she could.

01:14:58.294 --> 01:15:00.263
Must have been six buck's worth.

01:15:02.699 --> 01:15:04.701
I mean, there was more coins
than there was pudding.

01:15:07.571 --> 01:15:09.573
Then I read somewhere...

01:15:10.740 --> 01:15:13.643
that the nickel
in five-cent coins

01:15:13.710 --> 01:15:16.045
gave off toxins when cooked.

01:15:17.614 --> 01:15:19.716
It turns out
she was trying to kill me.

01:15:21.117 --> 01:15:22.586
With kindness though.

01:15:26.590 --> 01:15:28.725
[water running]

01:15:35.464 --> 01:15:37.133
There aren't any for you.

01:15:38.467 --> 01:15:41.137
-What's that?
-It's a water feature.

01:15:42.438 --> 01:15:43.640
What's it doing here?

01:15:43.707 --> 01:15:45.675
Phillip had it
put in this morning.

01:15:45.742 --> 01:15:49.045
Harris Real Estate
has got one, apparently.

01:15:49.112 --> 01:15:50.714
Don't you like it?

01:15:50.780 --> 01:15:53.817
I have to go to the toilet
all the time now, like nana.

01:15:55.051 --> 01:15:57.621
Is he in?

01:15:57.687 --> 01:16:00.624
He's around the corner,
checking out the billboard.

01:16:00.690 --> 01:16:02.191
We have a billboard?

01:16:03.192 --> 01:16:05.995
And a water feature.

01:16:12.168 --> 01:16:14.303
-Phillip.
-Frank.

01:16:16.139 --> 01:16:17.040
What do you reckon?

01:16:19.008 --> 01:16:20.877
Nice font.

01:16:20.944 --> 01:16:23.046
What did you think
of the water feature?

01:16:24.247 --> 01:16:26.049
Olivia showed it to me.

01:16:28.785 --> 01:16:31.220
You all right?

01:16:31.287 --> 01:16:33.890
Yeah, yeah, yeah, all good.
Piss off, Frank.

01:16:33.957 --> 01:16:36.592
Yeah, well,
that's not true.

01:16:36.660 --> 01:16:38.962
That's not based
on a true story.

01:16:41.865 --> 01:16:45.568
What's going on?
Nothing's going on, Frank.

01:16:45.635 --> 01:16:48.071
Everything's dandy.
Mm.

01:16:48.872 --> 01:16:51.574
Is it your old man?

01:16:51.641 --> 01:16:54.377
Okay, yeah.

01:16:54.443 --> 01:16:58.581
Don't take this the wrong way,
Frank, but I'm blaming you.

01:16:58.648 --> 01:17:03.552
Right. I must warn you,
there's a queue.

01:17:03.619 --> 01:17:05.154
This is costing me a fortune.

01:17:06.389 --> 01:17:08.424
[Frank] Mm.

01:17:08.491 --> 01:17:10.960
I want you to meet someone.

01:17:14.864 --> 01:17:16.833
I want you to meet
my dead mother.

01:17:20.469 --> 01:17:23.472
Oh, you bloody
double-crossed me,
that's what I reckon.

01:17:23.539 --> 01:17:27.110
You-- You said you'd be
at the beach waiting for us,

01:17:27.176 --> 01:17:32.248
and you-- and you weren't
bloody well there.
Dad?

01:17:33.649 --> 01:17:37.220
Dad, it's me. Phillip.
Ah.

01:17:37.286 --> 01:17:38.822
Again.
Oh, yes.

01:17:38.888 --> 01:17:41.324
Dad, I've brought someone
to see you.

01:17:41.390 --> 01:17:44.193
Hello, Noel.
I'm Sarah.

01:17:44.260 --> 01:17:48.932
No, no, not this one.
I wanna talk to the other one.

01:17:48.998 --> 01:17:52.068
Gave me
the bloody malaria pills.

01:17:52.135 --> 01:17:56.205
They're making me worse,
I reckon. I keep vomiting
the things up.

01:17:57.540 --> 01:18:00.744
Can't help that.
Can't help that.

01:18:00.810 --> 01:18:04.413
Noel? Noel?

01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:09.685
That's all done with now,
and you don't have to take them
anymore if you don't want to.

01:18:09.753 --> 01:18:12.956
My oath, I don't.
Bloody things.

01:18:13.022 --> 01:18:17.193
It's all done with now,
and you're back home now.

01:18:19.729 --> 01:18:22.431
Yeah?
It's all over with.

01:18:23.967 --> 01:18:26.770
You know, you're gonna be
up and about in no time.

01:18:26.836 --> 01:18:28.772
Yeah?
Yeah.

01:18:34.343 --> 01:18:36.412
When can I see B-Beth?

01:18:40.716 --> 01:18:44.453
Soon, love.
You'll see her soon.

01:18:49.558 --> 01:18:51.360
[chattering]

01:19:09.913 --> 01:19:12.816
You all right?
Yeah.

01:19:12.882 --> 01:19:14.750
It's all good.

01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:19.288
It's all good.

01:19:22.425 --> 01:19:23.927
Thanks.

01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:40.543
Phillip,

01:19:40.609 --> 01:19:45.214
did your father...
ever mention a Captain Simpson?

01:19:46.749 --> 01:19:50.319
He might have.
It comes pretty thick
and fast these days.

01:19:50.386 --> 01:19:51.821
No, before.

01:19:51.888 --> 01:19:54.290
Oh, before, he never
talked about anything.

01:19:54.357 --> 01:19:56.059
Uh-huh.

01:19:59.528 --> 01:20:03.566
Captain Simpson
was the commander
of your father's artillery unit.

01:20:05.234 --> 01:20:09.205
And when the Japanese
landed in Rabaul,
the men were cut off.

01:20:09.272 --> 01:20:12.541
They were...
totally isolated.

01:20:14.410 --> 01:20:17.146
And Simpson
had to take those men...

01:20:18.514 --> 01:20:22.151
there were 40 of them,
including your father,

01:20:22.218 --> 01:20:24.353
through the jungle
to safety.

01:20:26.822 --> 01:20:29.092
It took them three months.

01:20:32.561 --> 01:20:35.198
And later,
Simpson died of--

01:20:35.264 --> 01:20:38.167
died of malaria
in Port-- Port Moresby.

01:20:41.104 --> 01:20:45.208
Your father credits Simpson
with saving his life.

01:20:46.809 --> 01:20:50.379
And Simpson's first name,

01:20:50.446 --> 01:20:52.181
his given name...

01:20:53.682 --> 01:20:55.584
was Phillip.

01:21:09.865 --> 01:21:13.202
[car beeping]

01:21:13.269 --> 01:21:14.603
Here you go.

01:21:14.670 --> 01:21:16.539
Ah, thank you.

01:21:16.605 --> 01:21:17.573
You all right?
Mm.

01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:18.874
Good.

01:21:20.243 --> 01:21:23.612
Well, Phillip,
it was very nice to meet you.

01:21:23.679 --> 01:21:25.381
And your father.

01:21:27.716 --> 01:21:29.218
You're all right.

01:21:29.986 --> 01:21:31.187
[mumbles]
Oh.

01:21:31.254 --> 01:21:33.289
No. That's all right.
Sorry.
[laughing]

01:21:33.356 --> 01:21:36.892
I'll walk you
inside if you want.
No, thank you.

01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:39.162
You sure. I don't mind.
No, no, no, no, no.

01:21:39.228 --> 01:21:40.363
Bye.

01:21:42.431 --> 01:21:45.468
Wow.
I know.

01:21:45.534 --> 01:21:48.371
Freud was right.
He was onto something.

01:21:48.437 --> 01:21:50.706
[door closes]
He did very well out of it.

01:21:50.773 --> 01:21:52.641
So I'm told.

01:21:52.708 --> 01:21:56.779
Not like us, though.
Nah, nah,
not even close, mate.

01:21:56.845 --> 01:21:58.647
[car beeping]
Wrong racket.

01:21:58.714 --> 01:22:00.249
[engine starts]

01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:06.722
[band playing]

01:22:06.789 --> 01:22:13.929
[boy] * I died
at the hands of an angel *

01:22:13.997 --> 01:22:18.667
* Gently betrayed with a kiss *

01:22:20.569 --> 01:22:24.707
* All my dreams
came tumbling down *

01:22:26.342 --> 01:22:28.944
* What I've found *

01:22:29.012 --> 01:22:32.982
* Well, I was lost
without you *

01:22:33.049 --> 01:22:38.221
* I was lost without a trace *

01:22:38.287 --> 01:22:42.491
* Lost, never to be found *

01:22:42.558 --> 01:22:44.327
* Lost *

01:22:44.393 --> 01:22:46.495
* Without you I was lost *

01:22:46.562 --> 01:22:49.365
He faints. My Lord! My Lord!
* Without a trace *

01:22:49.432 --> 01:22:52.568
Break, heart. I prithee, break!
Look up, my Lord.

01:22:52.635 --> 01:22:56.805
Vex not his ghost.
0, let him pass!
He hates him much.

01:22:56.872 --> 01:23:00.243
That would upon the rack
of this tough world,
stretch him out longer.

01:23:00.309 --> 01:23:03.446
The wonder he's endured
so long!

01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:07.250
The weight of this sadness
we must obey.

01:23:07.316 --> 01:23:10.353
Speak what we feel,
not what we ought to say.

01:23:10.419 --> 01:23:12.688
The oldest have borne most.

01:23:12.755 --> 01:23:16.992
We that are young
shall not see as much
nor live as long.

01:23:17.060 --> 01:23:18.194
[band playing]

01:23:18.261 --> 01:23:20.129
* Lost *

01:23:20.196 --> 01:23:23.799
* Without you I was lost *

01:23:23.866 --> 01:23:26.169
* Without a trace *

01:23:26.235 --> 01:23:31.074
* Lost, never to be found *

[cheering, applause]

01:23:48.791 --> 01:23:50.025
Yeah!

01:24:10.646 --> 01:24:11.780
[chattering]

01:24:11.847 --> 01:24:13.982
[Wendy] You were the best.
[Frank Jr.] Really?

01:24:14.049 --> 01:24:16.419
[Wendy laughs]
[Frank] Yeah, no, you know--

01:24:17.253 --> 01:24:19.355
The sets were good.
Mm-hmm.

01:24:19.422 --> 01:24:20.856
The music not bad.
That's good.

01:24:20.923 --> 01:24:23.526
The costume.
Pantaloons come up great.
Really?

01:24:23.592 --> 01:24:26.462
And you and Edgar and--
Albany.

01:24:26.529 --> 01:24:28.931
Albany! You looked like
Adam and the Ants.

01:24:28.997 --> 01:24:31.867
[snorts] Frank!
No, I'm just--

01:24:31.934 --> 01:24:34.737
I'm just kidding, mate.
Good effort.

01:24:34.803 --> 01:24:36.605
Went well.
It was great.

01:24:36.672 --> 01:24:39.808
So, who's-- who's Goneril?
Rachel.

01:24:41.877 --> 01:24:43.712
[birds chirping]

01:24:43.779 --> 01:24:46.415
She isn't here, mister.
I called her an hour ago.

01:24:46.482 --> 01:24:48.584
[doorbell rings]
I knocked loud.

01:24:48.651 --> 01:24:51.354
Loudly.

01:24:51.420 --> 01:24:53.422
[knocks]

01:24:59.928 --> 01:25:02.798
[clock ticking]

01:25:10.673 --> 01:25:13.442
[teapot whistling]

01:25:25.020 --> 01:25:27.790
[clock chimes]

01:25:27.856 --> 01:25:30.726
[teapot continues whistling]

01:25:36.199 --> 01:25:38.133
[knocking]

01:25:38.201 --> 01:25:41.870
[clamoring]

01:25:42.805 --> 01:25:45.608
[footsteps approaching]

01:25:46.809 --> 01:25:50.579
Oh, shit. Shit, shit, shit.

01:25:50.646 --> 01:25:53.216
Sarah. Sarah.

01:25:55.651 --> 01:25:57.152
Sarah!

01:26:05.027 --> 01:26:06.762
[phone beeping]

01:26:12.468 --> 01:26:15.070
[woman on phone] Emergency.
What service do you require?

01:26:15.137 --> 01:26:18.641
[siren wailing]

01:26:18.707 --> 01:26:22.110
G'day, you've called Damien.
Leave me a message,
I'll call you back.

01:26:22.177 --> 01:26:24.680
Damien, it's Frank Mollard.

01:26:24.747 --> 01:26:27.716
Could you give me a call back
as soon as you get this message?

01:26:27.783 --> 01:26:30.919
Um, you can reach me
on this number.

01:26:30.986 --> 01:26:32.388
Thanks.

01:26:40.929 --> 01:26:43.432
[machine beeping]

01:27:33.048 --> 01:27:34.717
[woman]
We've met, I think.

01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:39.221
I'm Dr. Elliot.

01:27:39.288 --> 01:27:41.590
Your son had a fracture.

01:27:43.359 --> 01:27:45.994
Are you a friend
of the family?

01:27:46.061 --> 01:27:47.996
Not all of them, no.

01:27:49.798 --> 01:27:51.434
Were you downstairs?

01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:54.102
Yeah, I've been advanced
up to palliative.

01:27:54.169 --> 01:27:56.905
Right. Righto.

01:27:57.773 --> 01:27:59.442
Palliative?

01:28:00.709 --> 01:28:02.378
That's where
you can't fix 'em, right?

01:28:03.278 --> 01:28:06.782
That's-- That's correct.

01:28:10.152 --> 01:28:12.488
How the hell
is that a promotion?

01:28:48.591 --> 01:28:52.395
[respirator hissing]

01:29:16.051 --> 01:29:17.553
Mr. Mollard?

01:29:18.787 --> 01:29:20.088
Mr. Mollard?

01:29:23.759 --> 01:29:26.194
I've been thinking
about what you said,

01:29:26.261 --> 01:29:28.063
"How is that a promotion?"

01:29:30.265 --> 01:29:32.835
Oh, yeah. Um--

01:29:34.403 --> 01:29:36.104
Look, um--

01:29:37.406 --> 01:29:39.975
I'm really sorry
about that, you know.

01:29:42.210 --> 01:29:43.712
But, you know...

01:29:44.680 --> 01:29:46.815
you're gonna
have to take a number.

01:29:50.853 --> 01:29:52.621
Can we talk?

01:29:55.223 --> 01:29:57.760
[inhales] Yeah.

01:30:14.042 --> 01:30:15.778
Hold that thought.

01:30:21.950 --> 01:30:25.053
So-- [inhales]

01:30:25.120 --> 01:30:26.789
She's cactus, right?

01:30:31.359 --> 01:30:34.396
Damien's not onto that.

01:30:34.463 --> 01:30:37.065
My problem is,
without his say-so--

01:30:38.300 --> 01:30:40.368
Mm. Caveats.

01:30:40.435 --> 01:30:42.838
Unless her next of kin
can tell me otherwise,

01:30:42.905 --> 01:30:46.374
I'm legally obliged
to keep her,

01:30:46.441 --> 01:30:50.979
you know,
quote unquote.
Mm.

01:30:51.046 --> 01:30:55.117
I'm already in breach of about
six laws and 30 guidelines
even talking to you.

01:30:55.183 --> 01:30:57.520
Yeah.
[beeper beeping]

01:31:01.123 --> 01:31:06.161
Do you know
the five stages of grief?
The Kübler-Ross model?

01:31:06.228 --> 01:31:09.832
Denial, anger, bargaining,
depression, acceptance?

01:31:09.898 --> 01:31:14.036
Mm, I'm familiar
with bargaining.
Well, Damien's in denial.

01:31:14.102 --> 01:31:16.572
I would have thought
he went straight to anger.

01:31:17.673 --> 01:31:23.011
So, your relationship
with him is--
Mm.

01:31:23.078 --> 01:31:24.580
Right.

01:31:29.652 --> 01:31:31.854
I wonder if that could change?

01:31:40.062 --> 01:31:41.697
[sighs]

01:32:06.288 --> 01:32:09.524
The Power and the Glory.
Graham Greene.

01:32:09.592 --> 01:32:12.027
Jurassic Park.
Michael Crichton.

01:32:12.895 --> 01:32:15.698
No, just kidding.
It's a joke.

01:32:15.764 --> 01:32:19.001
To Kill a Mockingbird.
Harper Lee.

01:32:20.002 --> 01:32:21.169
Hmm.

01:32:26.942 --> 01:32:28.611
[sighs]

01:33:07.382 --> 01:33:09.084
[knocks]

01:33:14.322 --> 01:33:17.760
The Naked Civil Servant
by Quentin Crisp.

01:33:23.198 --> 01:33:26.368
If she knew,
why didn't she say anything?

01:33:26.434 --> 01:33:28.937
[James]
What? That you're gay?

01:33:29.004 --> 01:33:32.941
I mean, no.
What did you expect?

01:33:36.745 --> 01:33:39.815
The Leif Garrett poster
is a dead giveaway,
don't you reckon?

01:33:43.385 --> 01:33:45.053
[Frank sighs]

01:33:45.888 --> 01:33:48.857
Look--
[inhales, sighs]

01:33:48.924 --> 01:33:49.858
Sorry.

01:33:50.959 --> 01:33:53.962
[sniffles] I'm not gonna
be any good at this.

01:33:54.029 --> 01:33:55.163
At what?

01:33:56.832 --> 01:33:59.534
It's fine for you.
You've done this before.

01:33:59.601 --> 01:34:02.337
Yeah, and I stuffed it up.

01:34:02.404 --> 01:34:04.172
Why do you think I'm here?

01:34:07.242 --> 01:34:11.613
Look, Damien, I'm-- I'm not
where you are right now,

01:34:11.680 --> 01:34:15.150
but... I know
where you're headed.

01:34:16.418 --> 01:34:19.421
And my only recommendation
is that you don't go there.

01:34:23.458 --> 01:34:25.127
Let her go.

01:34:27.730 --> 01:34:29.197
I didn't.

01:34:30.733 --> 01:34:32.735
I couldn't.

01:34:34.269 --> 01:34:36.104
Now she's gone.

01:34:38.606 --> 01:34:40.142
I stuffed up.

01:34:42.510 --> 01:34:44.112
She died.

01:34:46.448 --> 01:34:48.016
By herself.

01:34:50.052 --> 01:34:52.420
And that's what's
gonna happen to me
if I'm not careful.

01:34:56.691 --> 01:35:01.329
Mate, you've got
to approach this head on,

01:35:01.396 --> 01:35:04.232
'cause if you don't,
it's gonna come back around
and bite you on the bum.

01:35:08.771 --> 01:35:11.073
You don't wanna grow up
to be like me, do you?

01:35:11.139 --> 01:35:12.474
[chuckles]

01:35:22.117 --> 01:35:24.920
[Damien on phone] They're
saying there's not much chance
her condition will improve.

01:35:24.987 --> 01:35:28.290
Well-- Well, none.
And if she remains stable--

01:35:28.356 --> 01:35:31.259
Right. So is this
what Elliot is saying?
Yeah, um,

01:35:31.326 --> 01:35:34.329
only that her condition
has deteriorated.
Okay.

01:35:34.396 --> 01:35:37.432
Atrophy is the word
they used so, um--
Right.

01:35:37.499 --> 01:35:41.703
But when they, um,
when they told her that--
Uh, yeah.

01:35:41.770 --> 01:35:43.671
Is that what she said
she thought?

01:35:43.738 --> 01:35:46.141
No, no, yeah,
that's what she said.
I mean they're all saying that.

01:35:46.208 --> 01:35:48.476
Okay.
That the palliative guy--

01:35:48.543 --> 01:35:51.446
Yeah, Right, yeah.
the neurologist guy, the, uh--

01:35:51.513 --> 01:35:54.649
Well, I mean, is it--
is it definite? Probable?
Possible?

01:35:54.716 --> 01:35:58.120
No. It's, uh, it's definite.
Right.

01:35:58.186 --> 01:36:01.056
Yeah, um, yeah, it's definite.
Right.

01:36:01.123 --> 01:36:04.226
Ah, that's the word
they're using a lot. Uh--

01:36:04.292 --> 01:36:06.161
So has she said it
or was it some doctor?

01:36:06.228 --> 01:36:08.430
She said it. Uh, they said it.
Right.

01:36:08.496 --> 01:36:11.766
Um, they were trying
to make a point to me, I think,

01:36:11.834 --> 01:36:13.802
that, um--
No.

01:36:13.869 --> 01:36:16.271
So, if you could, um--
I'll be there.

01:36:16.338 --> 01:36:20.542
I mean, I can understand--
If you want me there,
I will be there.

01:36:21.343 --> 01:36:23.778

[sniffles, sobbing]

01:38:14.022 --> 01:38:15.958
Can you help me?

01:38:19.027 --> 01:38:20.828
With the house?

01:38:20.895 --> 01:38:25.200
It'll have to be sold.
Sure.

01:38:25.267 --> 01:38:27.235
Can you help me with that?

01:38:31.439 --> 01:38:34.977
Yeah.
I've never done this before,
so I don't know how to--

01:38:37.845 --> 01:38:42.384
I mean, I suppose her affairs
need to be, uh, sorted out.

01:38:45.253 --> 01:38:48.023
-Could you help me
with the house?
-Yeah.

01:38:48.090 --> 01:38:50.425
I wouldn't know what to do. I--

01:38:55.397 --> 01:38:58.433
Well, it's yours
to do what you want.

01:38:59.634 --> 01:39:03.171
No. I--

01:39:03.238 --> 01:39:05.473
I mean, I don't know
what she wants.

01:39:07.175 --> 01:39:10.178
Wanted.
Wants.

01:39:13.348 --> 01:39:14.649
Yeah, look.

01:39:15.850 --> 01:39:17.552
Sure, I can--

01:39:18.386 --> 01:39:20.488
I can help you
with the house.

01:39:23.658 --> 01:39:25.427
I learned to walk there.

01:39:29.264 --> 01:39:33.201
I remember, uh--
[laughing]

01:39:38.740 --> 01:39:40.675
I remember the smell of cabbage.

01:39:43.545 --> 01:39:47.649
I remember the smell
of Dad's Benson & Hedges
on his coat

01:39:47.715 --> 01:39:49.351
and in his wardrobe.

01:39:52.987 --> 01:39:54.989
[door creaks]

01:40:12.407 --> 01:40:14.476
[Frank]
It's a nice big room.

01:40:19.847 --> 01:40:21.716
12-by-15 in the old money.

01:40:35.297 --> 01:40:38.366
I'm just gonna
sneak out the back.
Take your time.

01:40:46.108 --> 01:40:47.742
[baby fussing]

01:40:48.743 --> 01:40:50.645
[birds chirping]

01:41:02.957 --> 01:41:05.127
Well?
Hmm?

01:41:05.193 --> 01:41:09.231
Oh. You first.

01:41:09.297 --> 01:41:13.468
Well, what's the reserve?
There isn't one.

01:41:13.535 --> 01:41:15.570
Yeah, it'd have to be
mid-to-late sixes though, yeah?

01:41:17.172 --> 01:41:20.875
I reckon that's
about the region, yeah.

01:41:20.942 --> 01:41:24.179
We've told you already
we can't go past mid-fives.

01:41:24.246 --> 01:41:26.348
Late-fives at most.

01:41:28.650 --> 01:41:30.818
So, what are late-fives,
you reckon?

01:41:32.587 --> 01:41:34.422
Seventy-five?

01:41:35.923 --> 01:41:37.559
Done.

01:41:39.161 --> 01:41:40.295
You're kidding.

01:41:41.196 --> 01:41:43.365
Wait, you'll sell for 575?

01:41:43.431 --> 01:41:45.633
No, I wouldn't,
but that's the figure.

01:41:45.700 --> 01:41:49.504
That's your figure.
No, but it's the figure.

01:41:49.571 --> 01:41:51.906
You know, that's the figure.
Yeah, but, uh--

01:41:51.973 --> 01:41:55.543
Yeah, but there's no, you know--
No, no, no, no.
No caveats. Nope.

01:41:55.610 --> 01:41:58.446
Vendor wants a quick sale.
Quick settlement.

01:41:58.513 --> 01:42:00.815
You can do 60-day terms, yeah?

01:42:00.882 --> 01:42:03.718
I can talk to the bank.
You talk to the bank.

01:42:06.087 --> 01:42:08.756
Look, if I was
to write the board,

01:42:11.559 --> 01:42:13.728
I'd say
"Much Loved Family Home."

01:42:15.197 --> 01:42:17.265
The vendor doesn't want it
knocked down

01:42:17.332 --> 01:42:19.501
and some cheap flats
put up.

01:42:19.567 --> 01:42:21.403
Doesn't want to
"Jamie Durie" it.

01:42:23.271 --> 01:42:25.340
It's got a working garden.

01:42:27.875 --> 01:42:31.145
She needs a bit of love,
though, this ol' girl here.

01:42:31.213 --> 01:42:33.581
I wouldn't know.

01:42:33.648 --> 01:42:36.618
Bit of an aggro prune
should get her going again.
Mmm.

01:42:37.619 --> 01:42:40.422
I'm an arborist.
Tree doctor.

01:42:40.488 --> 01:42:41.756
I thought
that was in shipping.

01:42:43.425 --> 01:42:45.893
How many kids do you have?
Just the one. Why?

01:42:45.960 --> 01:42:49.197
Oh. Oh, yeah.

01:42:49.264 --> 01:42:52.600
Use the, uh, dad gag, yeah?

01:42:52.667 --> 01:42:56.137
That's where
I was heading, yeah.
Ah, very good. Very good.

01:42:56.204 --> 01:42:58.273
Your wife, um--
Julie.

01:42:58.340 --> 01:43:00.542
Julie.
Yeah, you introduced me.

01:43:00.608 --> 01:43:02.844
She seemed, um--
Oh, she'll be fine.

01:43:02.910 --> 01:43:05.112
You know, a bit--
Oh, no.

01:43:05.179 --> 01:43:07.415
Sorry, bookshelves.

01:43:07.482 --> 01:43:11.519
Half of her books are still
at her mum's place, 'cause
we can't fit them in the unit.

01:43:11.586 --> 01:43:14.155
She's a Dickens tragic.
I've been getting into him.

01:43:14.222 --> 01:43:15.623
He's pretty good,
don't you reckon?

01:43:15.690 --> 01:43:17.825
I wouldn't know, mate.
I'm dyslexic.

01:43:21.663 --> 01:43:25.132
You come into my office
Monday morning
with a 575 figure.

01:43:25.199 --> 01:43:27.302
We'll get the paperwork started.

01:43:27.369 --> 01:43:32.006
That's it? We're done?

01:43:32.073 --> 01:43:33.941
It's deceptively simple,
isn't it?

01:43:35.042 --> 01:43:36.944
Mate, you sure?

01:43:37.912 --> 01:43:39.281
I'm sure.

01:43:41.883 --> 01:43:44.552
Do you wanna pop in somewhere,
grab a drink to celebrate?

01:43:44.619 --> 01:43:49.223
No, no, no, no.
It's very generous of you, but
too early in my recovery for me.

01:43:51.693 --> 01:43:53.628
Go on.
Go inside and tell your wife.

01:43:53.695 --> 01:43:55.963
Do your twinkle fingers thing.
Go on.

01:44:03.705 --> 01:44:05.473
[door opens]

01:44:06.874 --> 01:44:08.410
[door closes]

01:44:13.981 --> 01:44:16.718
[chattering]

01:44:19.587 --> 01:44:21.255
575.

01:44:22.390 --> 01:44:25.727
[Julie clapping, shrieking]

01:44:40.207 --> 01:44:41.809
[sighs]

01:45:49.143 --> 01:45:51.679
[sighs]

01:45:57.251 --> 01:45:59.554
[lock clicks]

01:46:14.035 --> 01:46:15.703
[bird cooing]

01:46:18.172 --> 01:46:20.341
[yelling, chattering]

01:46:20.408 --> 01:46:23.077
[cheering]
[man, indistinct]

01:46:32.654 --> 01:46:37.759
[orchestral music]

01:47:43.991 --> 01:47:47.461
[trombone solo]

01:48:13.588 --> 01:48:16.123
[orchestral continues]

01:48:37.011 --> 01:48:39.581
[trumpet solo]

01:49:34.568 --> 01:49:36.303
[music fades]
