16:46.463 --> 16:49.341
No more documentaries for us.
Kaput.

16:49.425 --> 16:49.967
(light laughter)

16:55.305 --> 16:57.891
And also I just met with Larry.

16:59.309 --> 17:01.061
-Larry Pollard?
-Sophie: Mm-hmm.

17:01.145 --> 17:02.396
Margaret:
Why?

17:02.479 --> 17:02.980
Well, he's been...

17:04.940 --> 17:05.733
investigating the case.

17:05.816 --> 17:07.901
He has an interesting theory.

17:10.112 --> 17:11.530
He believes an owl

17:12.489 --> 17:15.159
has something to do
with that night.

17:15.242 --> 17:16.368
-Clayton: An owl?
-Mm-hmm.

17:17.703 --> 17:17.995
(sighs)

17:20.956 --> 17:24.001
-Clayton: Okay.
-Lucas: Who is Larry?

17:24.084 --> 17:26.044
-Um, Larry was our
next-door neighbor.
-Oh, okay.

17:26.128 --> 17:27.629
Clayton:
Do you remember when
he had that dead deer

17:27.713 --> 17:28.839
in his convertible?

17:28.922 --> 17:31.633
I mean, who drives
a convertible

17:31.717 --> 17:32.760
to go hunting?

17:32.843 --> 17:34.094
Margaret:
He's eccentric...

17:34.178 --> 17:35.012
(conversation fades out)

17:44.480 --> 17:44.938
This needs to end.

17:55.532 --> 17:57.951
(buzzer sounds)

17:58.035 --> 17:59.453
-(door opens)
-Margaret: Dad?

18:00.204 --> 18:02.206
Dad.

18:07.419 --> 18:09.171
(whirring)

18:11.590 --> 18:12.633
(beeps)

19:11.567 --> 19:16.029
(line ringing)

19:16.113 --> 19:19.116
I'm all torn up about Mike
losing his second appeal.

19:21.451 --> 19:24.079
He was a good neighbor.
A good man.

19:24.163 --> 19:28.208
It's a shame to see
an innocent man behind bars.

19:28.959 --> 19:29.877
A damn shame.

19:29.960 --> 19:33.714
But the defense,
the prosecution,

19:33.797 --> 19:36.967
neither of them made
much sense of the facts.

19:37.050 --> 19:39.845
And that's what makes what
I'm about to say so convincing.

19:42.306 --> 19:46.977
This theory accounts for
the previously unaccountable.

19:47.060 --> 19:48.937
I'm first to admit it's crazy.

19:49.021 --> 19:50.272
But that doesn't make it
any less true.

19:53.692 --> 19:56.904
There were confirmed
owl attacks in the area.

19:56.987 --> 19:58.947
In almost every case,
the owl strikes

19:59.031 --> 20:00.198
from behind,
attacking the head.

20:02.743 --> 20:03.744
In December,
when Kathleen died,

20:03.827 --> 20:06.330
barred owls are mating

20:06.413 --> 20:09.416
and known to be aggressive
and territorial.

20:09.499 --> 20:11.501
As you can see,

20:11.585 --> 20:14.129
the talon of the barred owl

20:14.212 --> 20:16.673
matches the set of wounds
found on Kathleen.

20:16.757 --> 20:19.760
Sophie:
Wow.

20:19.843 --> 20:22.054
Larry:
When the owl attacks,
the talons,

20:22.137 --> 20:24.514
like razors,
rip into Kathleen's skull.

20:24.598 --> 20:26.433
She fights to get the bird off.

20:26.516 --> 20:27.267
The tussle with the owl

20:27.351 --> 20:30.312
explains the scratches
and pinpricks

20:30.395 --> 20:32.940
on her face,
her nose, her hands.

20:33.023 --> 20:33.899
It also explains

20:33.982 --> 20:35.150
why there are
no skull fractures.

20:35.233 --> 20:38.737
And it tells us why.
In the examiner's report,

20:38.820 --> 20:40.113
"Hair was noted to be grasped

20:40.197 --> 20:40.989
between the left
and right hand."

20:41.073 --> 20:43.617
She was trying
to fight off the owl

20:43.700 --> 20:44.660
as it got tangled
in her hair.

20:44.743 --> 20:48.413
So finally, finally,
when the bird releases her,

20:48.497 --> 20:49.957
it flies away unharmed.

20:50.040 --> 20:53.335
But Kathleen,
she stumbles to the front door.

20:53.418 --> 20:56.672
Two drops of blood
fall onto the path.

20:56.755 --> 21:00.592
Kathleen grabs the door,
leaving a smear of blood.

21:00.676 --> 21:02.260
She's now disoriented.

21:02.344 --> 21:05.472
She moves up the back stairs,
heading to the linen closet,

21:05.555 --> 21:07.432
searching for something
to stop the blood

21:07.516 --> 21:09.476
that's now really coming down.

21:09.559 --> 21:11.269
And bam, Kathleen Peterson
falls down the stairs.

21:13.563 --> 21:15.649
Here...

21:17.401 --> 21:18.443
Look at this.

21:18.819 --> 21:20.654
Closer.

21:22.072 --> 21:23.532
The day before she died,

21:23.615 --> 21:24.908
they weren't there.

21:24.992 --> 21:26.284
That's why Kathleen was
outside in the first place.

21:28.662 --> 21:30.455
She must have put him
out there that night.

21:36.128 --> 21:37.254
And that's when
the owl decided to strike.

21:41.008 --> 21:42.259
(Sophie speaking French)

21:48.932 --> 21:50.350
(Jean speaking French)

22:00.610 --> 22:01.236
Jean: (on phone)
Sophie...

22:08.577 --> 22:09.619
(Jean sighs)

22:25.635 --> 22:27.512
(cheering on TV)

22:30.390 --> 22:32.059
So nice to get to be able

22:32.142 --> 22:34.019
to host you all for a change.

22:34.102 --> 22:36.563
Just wish the whole gang
were here.

22:36.646 --> 22:39.274
Well, I'm not sure your house
would even fit the whole gang.

22:41.777 --> 22:43.236
We'd make it work.

22:45.113 --> 22:46.239
-Mark: Go, go, go.
-Michael: Come on. Come on!

22:46.323 --> 22:47.407
Mark:
Come on. Come on, go!

22:47.491 --> 22:48.283
-Go. Oh!
-Goddammit!

22:51.078 --> 22:53.413
So, Michael, you read
anything good lately?

22:53.497 --> 22:55.874
Well, I read this pillow
five or six times.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.710
It's a real tour de force, Mark.

22:59.920 --> 23:01.338
(laughing)

23:01.421 --> 23:02.923
Oh, those little guys
are adorable.

23:03.006 --> 23:04.841
Now how long do they take?

23:04.925 --> 23:06.301
-Forty, 45 minutes at 350.
-Forty-five?

23:06.384 --> 23:07.928
Shoot, I don't have
the oven space.

23:08.011 --> 23:10.972
Well, no, you do, actually,

23:11.056 --> 23:12.265
if you just did
the sweet potatoes later.

23:12.349 --> 23:13.475
-I have a plan.
-Plans change.

23:13.558 --> 23:16.269
-Here, wha-what if I just--
-Lori, don't touch that oven.

23:16.353 --> 23:18.855
All I'm trying to say
is when I host,

23:18.939 --> 23:20.941
I like to give the guests
a little guidance

23:21.024 --> 23:21.942
on what to bring,
so we don't have--

23:22.025 --> 23:24.111
Yeah, and I like to not
micromanage my guests

23:24.194 --> 23:25.320
and stress them out
in advance.

23:25.403 --> 23:27.114
Hello? Can I just jump
in here for a second?

23:27.197 --> 23:29.074
-Lori, quiet!
-Just let us talk!

23:29.699 --> 23:32.160
Jesus Christ, you two.

23:33.370 --> 23:35.664
Clayton:
Becky point-blank
gave me an ultimatum.

23:35.747 --> 23:36.915
Todd:
Curb your drinking, though?

23:36.998 --> 23:38.959
I mean, what does curb mean?

23:39.042 --> 23:41.503
Like, stop.
It's the DUIs, man.

23:41.586 --> 23:43.755
Yeah, I'm sure hulking out
on 4th of July didn't help.

23:43.839 --> 23:45.423
Oh, fuck off.

23:45.507 --> 23:47.300
You know, why don't you just
tell her you're taking a break?

23:47.884 --> 23:48.885
Keep drinking.

23:48.969 --> 23:50.137
You mean lie to her?

23:50.220 --> 23:53.098
No, it's not lying.
You're just not...

23:54.099 --> 23:56.268
telling her the whole truth.

23:56.351 --> 23:58.812
I mean, you're curbing, right?
That's like coming
to a slow stop.

24:03.108 --> 24:03.442
But can I even do that?

24:06.444 --> 24:09.072
Like, can I curb my shit?

24:09.156 --> 24:12.367
I mean, it's not just
the drinking, it's everything.

24:16.413 --> 24:19.207
How do I know I'm not
going to be like Dad?

24:20.250 --> 24:21.835
Huh?

24:21.918 --> 24:24.004
He cheated on Mom.
He left her.

24:24.087 --> 24:26.214
He still hits her up for money.

24:27.090 --> 24:28.550
Look at Dad with Kathleen.

24:29.718 --> 24:33.013
Right? I mean, he's
a great husband, he's loyal.

24:33.763 --> 24:35.515
It's about the person, Clay.

24:35.599 --> 24:36.600
You're really psyching
yourself out about all this.

24:36.683 --> 24:39.227
If you want to do it,
you can get your shit together.

24:40.061 --> 24:42.189
(doorbell rings)

24:42.689 --> 24:43.523
Fuck yeah. Okay.

24:43.607 --> 24:44.733
Cue the music.
I'm going to let them in.

24:44.816 --> 24:46.610
Alright?

24:47.569 --> 24:48.612
Hold on. I'm coming!

24:50.405 --> 24:53.074
-Hey, happy Thanksgiving.
-Guest: Happy Thanksgiving!

24:53.158 --> 24:56.369
Melody:
Hi, I'm Melody.

24:56.453 --> 24:58.413
This Thanksgiving,
I'm thankful for...

25:00.624 --> 25:02.876
the strength of my spirit.

25:02.959 --> 25:04.586
-Thank you.
-Thank you, Melody.

25:04.669 --> 25:07.088
Josh:
Alright, guys. I'm Josh.

25:07.172 --> 25:09.883
And I would like to express
my gratitude through song.

25:10.675 --> 25:11.635

You want to go to a real party?

(both snicker)

26:01.643 --> 26:02.602
Aunt Blair:
Bless us, O Lord,
for these thy gifts

26:02.686 --> 26:05.105
which we are about
to receive from thy bounty

26:05.188 --> 26:07.232

26:10.402 --> 26:12.112
Yeah.
(chuckles)

26:12.195 --> 26:13.780
And I know Liz
is just so pleased

26:13.863 --> 26:15.365
to see us together.

26:15.448 --> 26:16.700
Martha should come
next year.

26:16.783 --> 26:17.867
Yeah.

26:18.952 --> 26:21.663
I mean, we will
if Dad keeps being a psycho.

26:26.376 --> 26:28.712
Well, we all need a break
from Michael now and then.

26:30.297 --> 26:31.631
What do you mean?

26:31.715 --> 26:32.674
Well, uh...

26:33.717 --> 26:35.552
Michael always did,
you know,

26:35.635 --> 26:37.929
march to the beat
of his own drum.

26:38.013 --> 26:40.473
And with you girls,
he, he was just so--

26:40.557 --> 26:42.726
Hey, Margie.
Important question.

26:42.809 --> 26:44.644
What part of the bird
do you want?

26:46.438 --> 26:50.275
(inmates shouting)

26:53.069 --> 26:55.155
(indistinct announcement
over loudspeakers)

27:01.244 --> 27:02.620
(inmates chattering)

27:05.081 --> 27:07.125
(buzzer sounds)

27:12.630 --> 27:14.007
You're starting to get soft.

27:15.925 --> 27:17.302
Need to get you lifting again.

27:20.764 --> 27:21.556
Michael.

27:23.308 --> 27:24.351
Michael.

27:26.686 --> 27:28.021
Big Ray:
I'm talkin' to you.

27:28.104 --> 27:29.689
(clattering)

27:29.773 --> 27:30.732
Jesus!

27:30.815 --> 27:32.192
-Michael.
-What the fuck you doing?

27:32.275 --> 27:33.651
What the fuck you doing!

27:33.735 --> 27:37.030
-I'm gonna fucking kill you!

(door clangs)

27:54.172 --> 27:57.425
(inmate shouts in distance)

27:59.969 --> 28:03.640
Larry:
The Peterson yard has
lots of wide-open space.

28:03.723 --> 28:06.267
Because of this,
barred owls love the woods

28:06.351 --> 28:08.812
surrounding 1810 Cedar.

28:08.895 --> 28:12.440
The yard gave them
ample opportunity to hunt.

28:12.524 --> 28:14.567
David: (over video)
Would you say with
a reasonable degree

28:14.651 --> 28:16.361
of medical certainty

28:16.444 --> 28:18.571
that Kathleen Peterson
was killed

28:18.655 --> 28:21.783
by blunt force trauma
to the head?

28:21.866 --> 28:23.910
-Dr. Radisch: Yes.
-Jim Maher: Was there
anything unusual

28:23.993 --> 28:25.787
about the hairs you found
in Kathleen's hand?

28:25.870 --> 28:27.038
James Gregory:
When I examined the hairs,

28:27.122 --> 28:28.790
there were ones where the cut

28:28.873 --> 28:30.291
looks like
the edge of a knife,

28:30.375 --> 28:31.626
and they were also ragged

28:31.709 --> 28:33.378
so it looks
as they were broken.

28:33.461 --> 28:35.547
It's a combination
of these two characteristics

28:35.630 --> 28:37.841
that make us think it was
an attack instead of a fall.

28:44.013 --> 28:45.223
I knew it.

28:46.558 --> 28:47.851
I damn well knew it.

28:50.645 --> 28:53.481
Crime scenes are littered
with evidence.

28:53.565 --> 28:55.775
Some of it you can see,
some of it you can't.

28:55.859 --> 28:57.944
This is a list
of the small stuff.

28:58.027 --> 29:00.321
Like pine needle

29:01.030 --> 29:02.949
and...

29:03.032 --> 29:03.283
(Sophie exhales)

29:03.366 --> 29:05.034
Larry.

29:05.910 --> 29:06.786
Mm-hmm.

29:08.413 --> 29:10.623
(Christmas music playing
over loudspeakers)

29:10.707 --> 29:13.168
(groans)
Already?

29:13.251 --> 29:16.421
Zamperini family
tradition. Hush.

29:16.504 --> 29:18.965
Turkey's gone,
and it's Christmas time.

29:19.048 --> 29:20.884
Oh god, we don't
even get to digest first?

29:20.967 --> 29:22.719
Oh, Mom.

29:24.804 --> 29:24.846
Alright.

29:26.222 --> 29:28.725
Let's go to bed.

29:28.808 --> 29:30.351
I'm glad you came
back home, kiddo.

29:31.478 --> 29:32.687
Means a lot to your mom.

29:35.023 --> 29:35.815
And to me.

29:36.816 --> 29:37.650
Yeah, of course.

29:39.277 --> 29:42.030
I mean, you are gonna fly
Margaret and Martha home

29:42.113 --> 29:43.323
for Christmas, right?

29:44.240 --> 29:45.492
I'm not a sadist.

29:45.575 --> 29:47.494
Candace:
Kathleen. Kathleen!

29:47.577 --> 29:49.162
What are you doing?

29:49.245 --> 29:52.332
Stop. I asked you not to put
those in the dishwasher.

29:52.415 --> 29:54.459
Jesus Christ!
They're not bone China.

29:54.542 --> 29:57.420
This is my house,
and these are my good plates.

29:57.504 --> 30:00.340
Okay, you know what?
I'll just get you some new ones.

30:00.423 --> 30:03.176
Candace: What?
What is going on with you?

30:03.259 --> 30:04.719
You have been awful all day.

30:06.596 --> 30:08.640
I mean,
you're clearly exhausted,

30:08.723 --> 30:10.266
you look like crap.

30:11.893 --> 30:13.853
(sniffles) Wow.

30:14.437 --> 30:16.773
Thank you so much.

30:16.856 --> 30:18.191
You know what?

30:18.274 --> 30:20.109
I am stressed,

30:20.193 --> 30:21.819
but some of us have
actual fucking jobs.

30:25.114 --> 30:26.115
(scoffs)

30:28.785 --> 30:32.664
You know what, you think
you're so much better than me,

30:32.747 --> 30:35.875
and you never miss a chance
to remind me of it.

30:37.835 --> 30:38.920
Everything I do...

30:40.338 --> 30:41.881
all my efforts...

30:43.633 --> 30:44.842
will always be second best
compared to you.

30:47.262 --> 30:48.805
(Christmas music continues)

30:51.057 --> 30:52.183
(scoffs)

30:54.477 --> 30:56.396
(stomping)

30:56.479 --> 30:58.147
(sighs)

31:01.150 --> 31:02.026
(music stops)

31:03.987 --> 31:05.572
Candace.

31:05.655 --> 31:08.032
-Oh, come on.
-What's going on?

31:08.116 --> 31:10.827
Nothing.
I... I messed up.

31:12.453 --> 31:13.454
Hey.

31:14.247 --> 31:15.790
We're all just
trying our best.

31:17.834 --> 31:20.920
(hip-hop music playing
over loudspeakers)

31:22.213 --> 31:23.423
Happy Thanksgiving.

31:45.069 --> 31:46.904
♪ ♪

31:48.364 --> 31:49.407
Clay.

31:51.200 --> 31:52.243
Wait.

31:53.661 --> 31:55.872
-Clay!
-(bottles clatter)

31:55.955 --> 31:58.750
(dance music playing)

31:58.833 --> 32:01.836
(crowd shouting)

32:13.056 --> 32:13.890
Are you happy?

32:13.973 --> 32:17.477
This is the best night
of my entire life.

32:17.560 --> 32:18.603
(both laugh)

32:19.562 --> 32:22.815
(crowd cheers)

32:35.411 --> 32:38.456
I couldn't sleep.

32:38.539 --> 32:41.125
Why not? Did I pick
a terrible mattress?

32:47.382 --> 32:48.716
Michael:
She's just stressed out.

32:55.932 --> 32:58.184
I could feel you all wishing
you were at your house.

32:58.267 --> 32:59.310
That's not true.

33:00.395 --> 33:01.729
It was lovely.

33:03.648 --> 33:07.402
You know, when she's
like that with us,

33:07.485 --> 33:10.530
it's a little window
into how she treats herself.

33:11.614 --> 33:13.908
Not even Kathleen's
good enough for Kathleen.

33:18.538 --> 33:18.913
(sighs)

33:20.748 --> 33:21.082
Thanks, Michael.

33:25.211 --> 33:28.256
-Did she bake this?
-Yep.

33:28.339 --> 33:30.633
God, that bitch
bakes a good pie.

33:30.717 --> 33:32.051
(Michael chuckles)

33:36.848 --> 33:39.600
Corrections officer:
640, on your feet.

33:40.184 --> 33:41.394
What?

33:41.477 --> 33:42.812
You got cleaning duty.

33:53.281 --> 33:54.157
(door closes)

33:57.201 --> 33:58.995
-What's going on?
-Relax, man.

33:59.078 --> 34:01.414
Cashed in a favor.
We got to talk.

34:03.791 --> 34:04.709
About what?

34:04.792 --> 34:06.335
About getting
your shit together.

34:06.419 --> 34:07.962
You're falling the fuck apart.

34:09.839 --> 34:12.133
This has nothing
to do with you.

34:12.216 --> 34:12.884
You keep getting thrown
in the hole,

34:12.967 --> 34:15.219
it's going
to be a long life.

34:27.190 --> 34:28.107
This isn't life.

34:29.358 --> 34:31.444
I know you, Mike.

34:31.527 --> 34:33.654
You're not a bad person,
but you did something.

34:33.738 --> 34:34.614
-Kathleen fell.
-Doesn't really matter

34:34.697 --> 34:36.783
because you're here.

34:37.950 --> 34:40.036
And you find a way
to live like this or you die.

34:40.119 --> 34:43.039
But make a decision
because you can't do both.

34:50.588 --> 34:52.465
You want to go?

34:54.300 --> 34:55.593
I'll find you a way.

34:57.094 --> 34:58.012
Something easy.

35:00.306 --> 35:01.599
It doesn't have to hurt.

35:04.977 --> 35:06.229
This is it, isn't it?

35:08.022 --> 35:09.065
This is it, Ray.

35:12.485 --> 35:13.069
This is how it all unfolds.

35:17.907 --> 35:19.492
-Fucking hell.
-Hey.

35:20.618 --> 35:21.410
I know.

35:21.494 --> 35:23.371
It's not going
to feel like this forever.

35:24.956 --> 35:26.499
Why are you being
so nice to me?

35:27.625 --> 35:28.000
What do I owe you?

35:30.586 --> 35:32.505
You don't owe me.

35:43.432 --> 35:45.268
Martha:
I identify as queer.

35:46.435 --> 35:48.688
I am queer.

35:52.149 --> 35:56.821
And it's been really hard
keeping that a secret.

35:56.904 --> 35:58.489
Todd:
I realized a little while ago

35:59.073 --> 36:00.825
how lonely I was.

36:03.619 --> 36:05.621
How scared...

36:08.249 --> 36:09.041
when I...

36:13.337 --> 36:16.048
I found out my father was
never getting let out of prison.

36:16.132 --> 36:19.302
And I wanted to tell you
for so long, especially.

36:23.890 --> 36:26.893
But there was never
any room for my stuff

36:26.976 --> 36:30.062
or, like,
anybody else's stuff.

36:31.022 --> 36:33.691
You know,
after some ups and downs,

36:35.234 --> 36:36.485
relapses...

36:38.863 --> 36:39.196
it's been 18 days.

36:41.616 --> 36:44.076
And a whole lifetime
of, like,

36:44.160 --> 36:45.453
that just being all there is,

36:45.536 --> 36:47.872
I don't...

36:48.831 --> 36:51.334
I don't think that you will

36:51.417 --> 36:54.295
ever really know me.

36:54.378 --> 36:56.756
Todd:
You know, it's my first
time home in a while.

36:57.256 --> 36:58.674
I'm doing good.

37:00.092 --> 37:00.134
I'm okay.

37:05.056 --> 37:06.098
Yeah, it's...

37:10.686 --> 37:11.729
it's hard.

37:13.564 --> 37:16.275
Therapist: I think Michael
might welcome hearing all this.

37:20.029 --> 37:21.489
What do you think, Martha?

37:22.949 --> 37:25.034
Thank you for listening.

37:25.993 --> 37:27.954
Group:
Thank you for sharing, Todd.

37:29.622 --> 37:31.040
Officer Kern:
Rug fiber.

37:31.123 --> 37:32.416
Sophie:
Next one.

37:38.255 --> 37:39.382
Officer Kern:
Dust.

37:39.757 --> 37:41.425
Next.

37:43.719 --> 37:44.845
Officer Kern:
Dried skin.

37:46.180 --> 37:46.347
Sophie:
Move on, please.

37:53.396 --> 37:55.439
Oh. See the angle?
This hair wasn't pulled.

37:55.523 --> 37:57.650
It was, it was sliced.

37:57.733 --> 37:58.275
Larry:
Talons like razors.

38:00.486 --> 38:02.488
This has got to be
the craziest damn thing

38:02.571 --> 38:03.739
I ever heard.

38:03.823 --> 38:04.865
Next slide.

38:12.373 --> 38:13.207
Increase the magnification.

38:17.086 --> 38:18.462
Can we magnify it more?

38:21.090 --> 38:22.800
(laughs)

38:22.883 --> 38:24.176
Art Holland:
The Petersons lived
in the woods.

38:24.260 --> 38:27.013
They had pillows, duvets.
I mean, come on.

38:28.139 --> 38:32.018
I'd like to see
slides 35-3-2

38:32.101 --> 38:36.439
through 35-3-10
again, please.

38:36.522 --> 38:38.399
-Officer Kern: Again?
-Sophie: Mm-hmm.

38:38.482 --> 38:40.276
But at this
magnification now.

38:47.950 --> 38:49.201
Larry:
My word!

38:50.536 --> 38:52.204
It's another feather.

38:52.288 --> 38:54.373
Tangled right up in her hair.

38:54.457 --> 38:56.375
-Is that blood?
-Yeah.

38:58.294 --> 38:59.879
Sophie:
Where was the hair found?

39:01.964 --> 39:02.673
Her hands.

39:02.757 --> 39:04.842
The feather was attached
to a hair

39:04.925 --> 39:06.385
found in her hands?

39:06.469 --> 39:08.596
The evidence is
six years old, okay.

39:08.679 --> 39:11.891
You're going to need to verify
what we're looking at there.

39:11.974 --> 39:13.267
It could be anything.

39:13.350 --> 39:14.977
Or it could be a hair

39:15.061 --> 39:17.730
Kathleen pulled from her head
as she fought off an owl.

39:18.814 --> 39:20.024
(annoyed sigh)

39:24.487 --> 39:26.697
I trust you were able to watch
the video explaining our theory.

39:26.781 --> 39:29.075
I did, yes. It's--

39:29.158 --> 39:30.242
Let me guess. Interesting.

39:31.994 --> 39:34.246
Is that a common reaction?

39:34.330 --> 39:36.749
It's one of
the more diplomatic ones.

39:38.667 --> 39:40.878
I'd like to ask you
about the feathers.

39:44.507 --> 39:45.966
What did you make of them?

39:47.343 --> 39:48.427
Strange thing to find, no?

39:48.511 --> 39:52.139
Oh, you can't imagine
the things we find on bodies.

39:52.223 --> 39:55.559
Near them.
Inside of them.

39:55.643 --> 39:58.312
I found a Skittle
inside a man's ear once.

39:58.395 --> 40:00.356
I don't think the guy
who stabbed him put it there.

40:01.982 --> 40:03.317
Honestly,
I never saw the feathers.

40:05.277 --> 40:07.113
The fragments were too small.

40:07.196 --> 40:08.948
I didn't even know
they were there.

40:12.243 --> 40:14.370
You understand this theory
accounts for everything.

40:15.246 --> 40:17.123
The scratches on her face.

40:17.206 --> 40:18.290
The blood on the path.

40:18.374 --> 40:21.335
The front door,
the walls, the stairs.

40:22.753 --> 40:26.090
Those brutal lacerations
without skull fractures.

40:28.008 --> 40:30.386
-I told you that feather--
-Feathers.

40:30.469 --> 40:35.432
The fragments... could have
come from anywhere.

40:35.516 --> 40:38.936
Then how do you explain
where it was found?

40:39.019 --> 40:42.690
Entwined with her hair
in her hand.

40:46.318 --> 40:49.613
Considering
this new information...

40:51.073 --> 40:52.825
are you willing to reconsider

40:52.908 --> 40:55.035
the cause
of Kathleen's death?

40:56.412 --> 40:58.956
If an owl
did attack Kathleen...

41:05.337 --> 41:07.840
we might find
talon scratches on the skull

41:07.923 --> 41:10.259
or DNA left behind
by the animal.

41:11.177 --> 41:12.845
I could reexamine
the entry point

41:12.928 --> 41:14.180
of the lacerations
with talons in mind,

41:14.263 --> 41:15.890
the wounds on
her face and hands.

41:15.973 --> 41:18.559
-Really?
-Sure.

41:18.642 --> 41:21.061
But there's nothing
I can do without a body.

41:22.438 --> 41:24.398
Kathleen would have
to be exhumed.

41:25.024 --> 41:26.442
And to do that...

41:28.402 --> 41:29.612
you need permission.

41:37.995 --> 41:39.538
(buzzer sounds)

41:39.622 --> 41:40.831
(door clangs)

41:40.915 --> 41:42.333
(inmates chattering)

41:42.416 --> 41:45.169
(cart rattling)

41:47.296 --> 41:48.714
-Hey.
-What the fuck?

41:48.797 --> 41:50.382
Oh, sorry. I, uh...

41:50.466 --> 41:51.634
Where's Big Ray?

41:51.717 --> 41:54.053
I don't know.
Transferred or some shit.

42:19.203 --> 42:19.411
Oh fuck...

42:23.040 --> 42:25.000
Oh fuck.

42:25.084 --> 42:25.626
Fuck, fuck.

42:28.170 --> 42:29.630
Woman:
We didn't do anything.

42:29.713 --> 42:31.924
-You couldn't--
-Oh god, that's great.

42:35.344 --> 42:36.637
Oh, that's so great.

42:38.931 --> 42:40.683
I mean, no offense,
you're really pretty,

42:40.766 --> 42:43.060
but that's just so...

42:43.811 --> 42:45.354
-...great.
-(door opens)

42:45.437 --> 42:46.438
Michael:
Oh, Jesus Christ!

42:46.522 --> 42:47.940
Boys, get down here!
Now!

42:48.023 --> 42:49.483
Oh shit. Shit!

42:55.197 --> 42:56.365
(door opens)

43:12.715 --> 43:13.716
Kathleen:
I can't believe this.

43:13.799 --> 43:16.302
I mean, I just cannot
believe you guys did this.

43:16.385 --> 43:18.721
I mean, Jesus,
look at the house.

43:18.804 --> 43:20.472
It was only supposed
to be a few friends.

43:20.556 --> 43:21.307
Kathleen:
A few friends?

43:21.390 --> 43:23.767
What sort of friends
would do this?

43:23.851 --> 43:25.102
I, I know I fucked up, okay.

43:25.185 --> 43:27.646
I'm a fuck-up.

43:27.730 --> 43:28.981
I want to make something
extremely clear

43:29.064 --> 43:32.026
to all of you.

43:32.109 --> 43:34.278
And your sisters,
Caitlin, so you text them

43:34.361 --> 43:35.946
or whatever
and let them know too.

43:39.033 --> 43:39.992
This Thanksgiving...

43:41.368 --> 43:43.203
was a shit show.

43:44.288 --> 43:45.331
Okay?

43:47.875 --> 43:49.335
So to make up for it,

43:49.418 --> 43:51.378
we are going to have
an incredible Christmas.

43:51.462 --> 43:53.589
The house will be
fully decorated,

43:53.672 --> 43:55.591
and everyone is coming home.

43:58.844 --> 44:00.179
It will be perfect.

44:01.638 --> 44:02.514
Is that understood?

44:03.891 --> 44:04.892
Yup.

44:11.231 --> 44:12.691
Alright, well,
I'm going to take a nap.

44:13.901 --> 44:15.903
And when I wake up,
it'll be clean.

44:18.489 --> 44:21.158
That's right.
Get on with it.

44:26.914 --> 44:28.248
Nice one, boys.

44:33.504 --> 44:35.130
That could have gone
a lot worse.

44:40.177 --> 44:42.346
I'm going to do it.

44:43.138 --> 44:45.265
Caitlin:
What?

44:46.266 --> 44:47.643
I'm going to propose to Becky.

44:49.895 --> 44:53.107
-Caitlin: What?
-Holy shit, Clay. What? What?

44:53.190 --> 44:54.358
-Holy shit!
-Oh my god!

44:54.441 --> 44:55.567
Shh!

44:55.651 --> 44:56.652
We got to tell Dad
and Kathleen.

44:56.735 --> 44:57.861
I have to ask her first.

44:57.945 --> 44:59.279
I'll tell them at Christmas.

44:59.363 --> 45:00.197
-Are you serious?
-(Caitlin laughs)

45:00.280 --> 45:01.782
Shut up. Shut up!

45:01.865 --> 45:03.200
Announcer: (on TV)
Well, good morning, everyone,

45:03.283 --> 45:05.494
and welcome to game time.

45:05.577 --> 45:06.787
The highs, the lows,

45:06.870 --> 45:09.123
the good calls, the bad.

45:09.206 --> 45:11.708
And of course
the two games everyone...

45:11.792 --> 45:12.668
-Thanks.
-Mm.

45:15.337 --> 45:17.381
I've never
seen these before.

45:17.464 --> 45:18.674
Yeah.

45:20.175 --> 45:22.636
Looking at you girls,
it's like looking at Liz.

45:25.097 --> 45:26.807
Liz was so full of adventure.

45:27.724 --> 45:29.977
Moving to Germany to teach.

45:30.060 --> 45:31.603
Marrying
an air force captain.

45:32.980 --> 45:35.065
I felt like such
a plain Jane next to her.

45:37.151 --> 45:39.820
But I think that
Liz could be brave

45:39.903 --> 45:41.864
because she always had me
to fall back on.

45:42.739 --> 45:43.907
Yeah, I get that.

45:46.368 --> 45:47.536
Let me show you.

45:50.414 --> 45:52.332
This is a photo
of you and Martha

45:52.416 --> 45:54.835
when you guys stayed with me
and Steven for the summer.

45:54.918 --> 45:56.628
(laughs)

45:56.712 --> 45:58.630
We were here
for a whole summer?

45:58.714 --> 46:00.340
-Hmm.
-In Rhode Island?

46:00.424 --> 46:01.675
Yeah.

46:01.759 --> 46:04.136
You were six,
and Martha was four.

46:05.554 --> 46:06.847
That's a long time.
Dad just...

46:09.558 --> 46:11.560
just sent us here for fun?

46:18.859 --> 46:22.821
Patty was overwhelmed
with you and the boys,

46:22.905 --> 46:25.240
so she gave me custody
of you and your sister.

46:26.033 --> 46:28.494
-What?
-But then, um, well,

46:28.577 --> 46:29.995
Michael, he took you back.

46:30.078 --> 46:32.372
(scoffs)

46:33.749 --> 46:37.169
He didn't approve
of my devotion to God.

46:37.252 --> 46:38.837
Then four years later,

46:38.921 --> 46:42.007
when Martha had
behavioral issues,

46:42.090 --> 46:44.051
boy, did Michael
change his tune.

46:44.134 --> 46:47.596
He wanted to keep you
and give her to me...

46:48.805 --> 46:51.141
but I refused.

46:51.225 --> 46:52.726
I knew what it was like
to lose a sister.

46:52.809 --> 46:54.311
Ho-hold on, hold on.

46:55.979 --> 46:56.813
So you're saying that Dad...

46:58.941 --> 47:00.359
Dad wanted to split us up?

47:02.444 --> 47:02.778
Yes.

47:06.490 --> 47:07.783
(cell phone ringing)

47:14.831 --> 47:16.375
(line ringing)

47:22.798 --> 47:25.551
(whispering)
Oh my god, I have so much
to tell you, oh shit.

47:26.134 --> 47:28.011
Is everything okay?

47:28.095 --> 47:29.596
I'm not with Shawn anymore.

47:30.264 --> 47:31.306
Fuck the Shawns.

47:32.474 --> 47:34.434
-What?
-No, it's really good,
actually, Margie.

47:34.518 --> 47:36.812
It's really, really good.

47:39.273 --> 47:42.234
Okay. Um, I have
something to tell you.

47:42.317 --> 47:43.193
-Aunt Blair just--
-You're just gonna freak out

47:43.277 --> 47:45.571
when I tell you because
I'm so stupid happy.

47:45.654 --> 47:48.448
And I just want
to see your face

47:48.532 --> 47:48.949
when I tell you why.

47:52.077 --> 47:55.414
Oh, uh, okay, yeah.

47:55.497 --> 47:56.832
I think I'm going
to tell you at Christmas.
You and Caitlin.

47:59.501 --> 48:00.627
(exhales forcefully)

48:00.711 --> 48:02.838
What were you going to say?

48:06.174 --> 48:07.259
You know what?

48:07.342 --> 48:09.928
I will tell you
at Christmas too.

48:14.975 --> 48:16.810
(buzzing)

48:22.024 --> 48:23.150
Hello?

48:23.233 --> 48:24.735
Sophie: (over phone)
Caitlin Atwater?

48:24.818 --> 48:25.777
Yes.

48:25.861 --> 48:27.029
Sophie:
Sorry to bother you.

48:27.112 --> 48:27.988
My name is Sophie Brussard.

48:30.532 --> 48:33.452
Um, I'm, I'm calling
about your mother.

48:33.535 --> 48:35.787
I-I've been doing
some investigating,

48:35.871 --> 48:38.165
and I believe
the defense's theory

48:38.248 --> 48:40.751
about what happened
that night is wrong.

48:40.834 --> 48:44.671
I-I-I don't, um,
I don't think I understand.

48:48.133 --> 48:48.800
Well, I'm not doing
a very good job

48:48.884 --> 48:51.637
at explaining myself,
I think.

48:51.720 --> 48:53.972
Um, can we just meet
to talk?

48:54.056 --> 48:55.349
I think it'd be better.

48:55.432 --> 48:56.475
I'm busy.

48:56.558 --> 48:58.477
Um, can, can you just say

48:58.560 --> 49:00.312
whatever you need to say?

49:02.230 --> 49:04.775
There are a lot of questions
that remain about that night,

49:04.858 --> 49:06.902
and I have a theory

49:06.985 --> 49:09.863
I, I feel answers
those questions.

49:13.200 --> 49:13.825
(owl hoots)

49:18.580 --> 49:20.207
(Kathleen groans)

49:22.918 --> 49:25.295
I'm gonna take care
of that email.

49:26.463 --> 49:27.756
Oh, just stay.

49:28.590 --> 49:29.758
You're ruining the moment.

49:30.342 --> 49:32.302
Ruining?

49:33.053 --> 49:34.930
-I'm ruining it?
-Never mind.

49:39.059 --> 49:40.435
You know what I mean.

49:40.519 --> 49:41.311
What's the point
of working so hard

49:41.395 --> 49:43.689
if you can't live
the life you want?

49:43.772 --> 49:47.526
Hmm. I work hard so you
can live the life you want.

49:47.609 --> 49:49.528
Alright, let's not
do this tonight, okay.

49:54.866 --> 49:56.576
Alright.
I'll see you in bed.

49:57.244 --> 49:57.911
Don't stay out too late.

53:36.838 --> 53:38.256

53:40.258 --> 53:42.552
We'll need to exhume
your mother's body

53:43.887 --> 53:45.680
to get the answers
we're looking for.

53:46.181 --> 53:49.935
So... um...

53:50.018 --> 53:52.187
I'm humbly asking
for your permission.

53:54.481 --> 53:56.900
What? What?
What the fuck is wrong with you?

53:58.401 --> 54:00.779
No. No!

54:00.862 --> 54:03.490
No. How, how fucking dare you!

54:03.573 --> 54:06.576
Well, if there were,
if there were any other way,

54:06.660 --> 54:09.079
I wouldn't but please--

54:09.162 --> 54:11.539
Michael Peterson
murdered my mother!

54:13.667 --> 54:15.961

that he will die in prison.

55:22.819 --> 55:24.779
I know it's hard
for you to come here.

55:27.115 --> 55:29.325
It's just tough,
tough to see you in here.

55:29.409 --> 55:31.161
