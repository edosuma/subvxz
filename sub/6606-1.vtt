00:52.303 --> 00:55.181
Sandy?
- What's the matter, princess?

00:55.348 --> 00:57.475
Honey, Sandy, what happened?

00:58.810 --> 01:01.062
I don't remember.

03:03.017 --> 03:04.644
Come in.

03:05.854 --> 03:11.359
What is this ridiculous thing? Come here.
- It's called the Windsor knot.

03:11.526 --> 03:16.197
It's like a noose.
- I got it at a Playboy's Guide to Style.

03:16.364 --> 03:21.077
Oh my gosh, stick with the encyclopedia.
Got you where you are.

03:22.704 --> 03:29.377
I mean, don't get me wrong, Sandy's a cool
chick but it's not like you're gonna marry her.

03:29.544 --> 03:31.296
You're not gonna marry her, are you?

03:31.462 --> 03:35.175
I don't have any thought of what I'm doing
next week. Never mind, the rest of my life.

03:35.341 --> 03:41.097
Well, you could figure it out because I'm sure as shit Sandy has.
And you can bet your ass that her parents have some pretty
strong opinions on the subject.

03:41.264 --> 03:42.807
And what's that suppose to mean?

03:42.974 --> 03:47.187
Just think how they don't like their perfect
little princess banging big bad wolf.

03:47.353 --> 03:51.816
I'm not banging her, Lex.
I'm dating her, faithfully.

03:51.983 --> 03:56.779
Alright, next year when she's at Stanford
and you're slumming in at State...

03:56.946 --> 04:03.870
I'll give you two months before she finds some
pre-med and you meet the entire cheering squad.

04:04.037 --> 04:08.249
Oh, yeah? What about you and TJ?
- I wanna show you something.

04:11.461 --> 04:14.464
Subtle.
- Gotta love it, right?

04:14.631 --> 04:16.132
Is that wash off?

04:47.372 --> 04:51.459
Chad, what is it?
- You gotta go.

05:04.264 --> 05:06.015
Layla's here.

05:07.851 --> 05:13.022
Wait, what? I thought you
said you broke up.

05:14.357 --> 05:15.942
I lied.

05:17.402 --> 05:22.365
You asshole. How could you...?
- Have you seen your body?

05:22.532 --> 05:25.952
But I thought you said...
- You thought I said what..?

05:27.996 --> 05:30.623
You never were a match for thinking.

05:36.588 --> 05:40.091
Hey, pass.
- Nice arm...

05:40.258 --> 05:42.343
For a girl.

05:42.510 --> 05:49.017
Maybe I'll play college football too, huh.
- I got three words for you, TJ. Random drug test..

05:51.811 --> 05:54.397
Too early for beer, ain't it?

05:57.066 --> 06:01.112
You put all the others?
- Scholarships don't come on line everyday, Jake.

06:01.279 --> 06:07.118
True, dude. Well, like every other day.
- One day they'll just stop coming, believe me.

06:07.285 --> 06:08.620
Hey, daddy.

06:11.831 --> 06:17.212
Going to the graduation party tonight?
- God, I hope not. TJ, do me a favor. Keep things under control, will you?

06:17.378 --> 06:23.510
You're really embarrassing to bust my whole family.
- Rated G, PG at the worst.

06:27.013 --> 06:32.727
It's rare to find students so qualified in the
same school and they belong in the same family.
-- Thank you, sir.

06:32.894 --> 06:37.440
May your future be as bright as your past.
- Hear, hear.

06:37.607 --> 06:42.654
Well, after college I'd like to become a doctor just like you.
- Then we'll be colleague someday.

06:42.820 --> 06:48.201
Eli wants to be a doctor too, don't you Eli?
- Oh well, no actually, I was looking...

06:48.368 --> 06:51.496
Actually my little brother wants to become a pirate.

06:54.207 --> 06:58.962
I don't wanna become a pirate.
That's such fictional, I mean...

06:59.128 --> 07:04.384
Well anyone that becomes valedictorian after
skipping a grade can do whatever he wants.
- Well thank you. Thank you very much.

07:06.594 --> 07:09.597
You must be very proud.
- We are.

07:09.764 --> 07:16.271
Then you'll even be more proud to learn that I'm
recommending both Sandy and Eli for full academic scholarship.

07:20.149 --> 07:24.070
Just consider it a graduation
present for your parents.

07:24.237 --> 07:26.990
We're going to Stanford.
- We are.

07:28.241 --> 07:32.453
Well, enough of that boring stuff.
What are you two gonna get into this summer?

07:32.620 --> 07:34.998
Just a little charity work, sir.

07:56.769 --> 07:58.605
Ladies.

08:02.817 --> 08:06.946
You're an asshole.
- I love you too.

08:08.198 --> 08:11.201
Let's do some fucking shots.

08:13.161 --> 08:16.039
New king in town, bitches.

08:16.206 --> 08:20.793
All bow down before my lengthy lance.

08:22.212 --> 08:24.464
You're so wet, good.

08:32.679 --> 08:37.477
Have you ever wonder what I'd be like
to live in another time and place?

08:37.644 --> 08:44.234
Like to exist in a completely formed reality
where societal conventions don't apply.

08:44.400 --> 08:46.736
Like in France or something?

08:47.987 --> 08:50.532
No, like, like...

08:50.698 --> 08:55.328
I really wish I was a pirate.

08:55.495 --> 09:00.124
Eli, you're so random.
- No seriously, think about it.

09:00.291 --> 09:07.382
Like think about it. I can be a pirate
just like, sail over the world.

09:07.549 --> 09:09.592
Have a parrot.

09:11.135 --> 09:16.099
Crunches a sword and then rips a bodice.

09:16.266 --> 09:18.810
What's a bodice?

09:20.937 --> 09:24.357
Hey, there's my girl.
- Hey, baby.

09:24.524 --> 09:28.820
Wasn't sure what you wanted? So I got vodka or rhum.
- How about both?

09:28.987 --> 09:33.491
Whoa, easy. Whoa, whoa. What are you Irish?
- My mom thinks I'm staying at Hannah's tonight.

09:33.658 --> 09:37.620
Then I'm gonna get a second round.
- Hey, come here.

09:37.787 --> 09:40.623
I love you.
- I love you too.

09:44.627 --> 09:48.631
You're so goddamn hot.
- Yeah, don't you forget it.

09:49.924 --> 09:53.761
Oh if you ever cheat on me
I swear to God I'd kill the guy.

09:53.928 --> 09:59.434
Don't worry baby. I don't want
anybody else. Not now, not ever.

09:59.601 --> 10:03.855
Yeah, you hear that? This ass belongs to me.

10:12.989 --> 10:14.449
Cheers.

10:17.869 --> 10:21.164
I'm done here. I'm fucking wasted.

10:29.714 --> 10:31.341
Hold it.

10:46.064 --> 10:53.196
Jennifer Atkins back in my jeep,
driver's at the glass, summer school.

10:54.739 --> 10:57.534
Ride that stick, baby.

10:58.826 --> 11:00.495
You're a whore.

11:01.621 --> 11:05.041
Alright, alright, alright. Dominic Sperduto...

11:06.918 --> 11:11.673
9th grade, 50-yard line
at the football field.

11:13.132 --> 11:16.010
Sperduto?
- What, he was good.

11:16.177 --> 11:19.472
He was hairy, but it's good.

11:25.854 --> 11:28.273
Shut up.
- What about you, Eli?

11:34.028 --> 11:39.742
A gentleman doesn't kiss and tell.
- And what's that gotta do with you. Spill it, fish fag.

11:42.871 --> 11:46.082
Fine. Your mom. Last night.

11:55.967 --> 11:58.303
You don't know why it's always about my mother.

11:58.469 --> 12:02.724
Eli, I wanna make fun of Chad just ask
him about the training in Tijuana.

12:08.021 --> 12:10.148
I wanna hear about Sandy.

12:10.315 --> 12:14.944
You know, sometimes some memory
lane should never be discussed.

12:16.404 --> 12:20.366
But my first kiss, now that was pretty hot.

12:20.533 --> 12:24.120
Boring.
- Wait, wait. I wanna hear it.

12:24.287 --> 12:31.002
Okay. Well, it was in the graveyard. You remember it?
- I remember it.

12:31.169 --> 12:35.548
We were playing the game.
- I was there.

12:35.715 --> 12:39.427
We were all there.
- Oh yeah, the game.

12:39.594 --> 12:43.848
That was so fun.
- I was so scared.

12:44.015 --> 12:49.395
Surrounded by all those dead bodies, so quiet.
I was the last one left.

12:49.562 --> 12:53.733
And you were all out there looking
for me. Hunting me.

12:53.900 --> 12:59.280
My heart was pounding, knowing that any second
someone was gonna jump out and grab me.

12:59.447 --> 13:04.369
I didn't know whether I was gonna
have a heart attack or an orgasm.

13:04.536 --> 13:08.581
Oh God, that sounds so hot.
- I'm hot.

13:08.748 --> 13:10.458
And wet.

13:15.880 --> 13:19.008
Grab the beers.
- Grab the beers.

13:29.477 --> 13:35.024
Who wins? Who wins?
The Chad wins.

13:35.191 --> 13:39.946
You cut through the fucking... You went the complete
wrong way. That's not even the course bro.

13:40.113 --> 13:45.243
We gotta to have a complete rematch.
There's no fucking way that that is gonna be the result.

14:10.226 --> 14:14.105
Oh whoa, careful kids. God's watching.

14:14.272 --> 14:18.318
Okay, while we're here are we gonna
play or we're just gonna make out?

14:18.484 --> 14:20.695
I vote play.
- Me too.

14:20.862 --> 14:24.115
Alright dipshits, huddle up.
- Okay, everybody hold a hand.

14:24.282 --> 14:29.913
Dude, this is so gayish.
- Oh, go back, wash mop head.

14:30.079 --> 14:32.874
Okay, who's the ghost?
- Can I play?

14:34.334 --> 14:39.839
You scared the crap out of me, little momma.
- I'd really like to play.

14:40.006 --> 14:43.593
It's my favorite game.
- I bet it is, baby.

14:45.053 --> 14:49.891
I know all the best hiding spots.
- That's what I'm talking about.

14:51.059 --> 14:56.147
I don't know, it's kinda weird.
- You got it bro, girls are so weird.

14:56.314 --> 15:00.485
Come on, let her play.
You might get lucky, Eli.

15:03.613 --> 15:07.784
Oh come on Eli, I'll protect you.
- You're in.

15:10.078 --> 15:11.830
Come here.

15:13.498 --> 15:16.626
Alright, spread it out.
- Wait, wait. What are the rules again?

15:16.793 --> 15:21.714
One person's the ghost. Everybody else hides,
once you're caught you turn into a ghost.

15:21.881 --> 15:24.592
Last one alive wins.

15:24.759 --> 15:29.430
Alright, who's the ghost?
- I am. I am the ghost.

15:29.597 --> 15:31.808
Okay, come on.
- Here we go.

15:31.975 --> 15:38.064
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
release the one ignored by heaven.

15:38.231 --> 15:43.403
eight, nine, ten, now run and hide
or join her at the devil's side.

15:43.570 --> 15:48.449
eleven comes, the clock will chime
forgotten souls erased by time.

15:48.616 --> 15:53.580
midnight comes, it's not too late
so kill the ghost or seal your fate!

15:57.125 --> 16:00.211
Midnight.

16:22.859 --> 16:25.111
Layla's a ghost.

16:29.657 --> 16:31.951
Lex is a ghost.

16:33.536 --> 16:35.705
Chad's a ghost.

16:37.499 --> 16:40.752
And Mitchell's sacked and lost.

16:46.007 --> 16:47.634
This is so stupid.

16:50.512 --> 16:53.556
Hannah's a ghost.
Fucking ghost, yeah.

17:07.278 --> 17:11.741
Sandy's a ghost.
- You go that way. We'll get her.

17:20.959 --> 17:24.503
You're the only one left. You won.

17:27.757 --> 17:32.470
What are you doing?
- Do you remember me?

17:36.015 --> 17:38.059
Do you remember me?

17:44.732 --> 17:46.401
Hey, be careful.

17:49.112 --> 17:51.406
You will.

18:03.668 --> 18:06.754
Hey, where did she go?

18:07.964 --> 18:09.924
Sandy, what happened?

18:12.552 --> 18:17.182
The girl just jumped.
- What happened?

18:17.348 --> 18:21.561
What happened?
- The girl she just jumped off the cliff.

18:25.064 --> 18:30.862
We've been over every inch ground
down there and I'm telling you there's no girl.

18:31.029 --> 18:35.783
It's gotta be something.
People are just disappearing.

18:35.950 --> 18:41.498
I hate to say this boss but,
maybe she's just making it up.

18:44.250 --> 18:46.503
I think I'm gonna be sick.

18:49.881 --> 18:53.009
Everything okay, daddy?
- Yeah, baby.

18:53.176 --> 19:00.308
Look, ah, there's nothing down there.
- Wait, wait, but Sandy saw her jumped.

19:00.475 --> 19:05.939
I know, I know. That's why we're here,
that's why we're gonna stay here until I make sure everybody's safe.

19:06.105 --> 19:09.400
So what do we do?
- Keep looking for her.

19:09.567 --> 19:14.489
You, you take her home.
Don't worry, if she's here, we're gonna find her.

19:18.493 --> 19:22.497
She's dead, isn't she?
- Sandy, nobody's dead.

19:22.664 --> 19:27.377
I saw her jumped.
- Maybe she's hiding.

19:27.544 --> 19:31.881
Maybe planning a joke or something.
- Dude, why don't we just get home?

19:33.091 --> 19:37.512
There's nothing we can do tonight, you guys.
Let's call it a night.

19:41.683 --> 19:44.102
Are you okay?

19:44.269 --> 19:46.229
I know what I saw.

19:50.483 --> 19:55.321
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
release the one ignored by heaven.

19:55.488 --> 19:59.492
eight, nine, ten, now run and hide
or join her at the devil's side.

19:59.659 --> 20:03.079
eleven comes, the clock will chime
forgotten souls erased by time

20:03.246 --> 20:08.251
midnight comes, it's not too late
so kill the ghost or seal your fate!

20:54.464 --> 20:59.427
Sister Dolores says
it's my magic breath.

20:59.594 --> 21:04.849
That's a pretty flower.
- They're called forget-me-nots.

21:06.476 --> 21:08.811
You put them over the graves.

21:08.978 --> 21:12.565
How come?
- So you don't forget the dead.

21:14.025 --> 21:17.028
But I don't know any dead people.

21:18.738 --> 21:20.740
I do.

21:22.992 --> 21:26.120
Oh, sad.
- That's okay.

21:26.287 --> 21:33.044
Sister Dolores says that if my faith is strong
enough, I can have all the friends I want.

21:38.633 --> 21:42.470
But I only want you.

21:45.974 --> 21:48.434
Bestfriends?

21:51.479 --> 21:53.523
Friends forever.

22:16.421 --> 22:18.464
Good morning.

22:21.092 --> 22:25.096
We should leave.
- Do we have to?

22:26.055 --> 22:30.435
Stop it.
- Doesn't feel like you want me to stop.

22:42.447 --> 22:45.366
What's wrong with you? Are you okay, baby?

22:55.001 --> 22:57.879
I wished we break up.

23:03.176 --> 23:06.846
What? Why?
- I'm over it.

23:09.390 --> 23:11.684
Why did I not do it right?

23:15.480 --> 23:17.649
I'm just not feeling it.

23:22.320 --> 23:26.324
It's Hannah, isn't it?
I knew it, I know you're into her.

23:26.491 --> 23:29.327
Look, I just don't wanna be
tied down to anybody.

23:33.456 --> 23:35.291
Don't you fucking dare.

23:41.840 --> 23:46.302
Fine. It's yours.
Swim for it.

24:52.035 --> 24:54.370
Are you okay?

24:55.497 --> 24:57.123
Wait.

26:17.662 --> 26:20.331
Do you have anything smaller?
- Here.

26:20.498 --> 26:24.878
Perfect. Let Chad see what he's missing.

26:25.044 --> 26:29.299
Wait, I thought you were over him.
- I am. - So what happened?

26:29.465 --> 26:34.596
Let's just say, I wasn't wearing panties at the party.
- Hannah, you didn't.

26:34.762 --> 26:39.184
Oh, I most definitely did.
- What about Layla?

26:39.350 --> 26:42.228
Who?
- If she finds out, it's gonna be major drama.

26:42.395 --> 26:45.315
Hold on. Chad is seeing someone else?

26:47.734 --> 26:53.239
What a dick. Of course, if it wasn't for his massive...

26:55.033 --> 26:57.368
It's kinda hot .

26:59.037 --> 27:04.709
Hey, take it easy with my brother, okay. He likes you.
- Really?

27:06.503 --> 27:12.217
I didn't see anything. Not that there's
anything to see, of course, there's something to see.
There's a lot to see.

27:12.383 --> 27:17.597
I just, I didn't, I didn't see it.
- Turn around, goofball.

27:20.683 --> 27:22.602
Will this make me look like a slut?

27:25.605 --> 27:27.899
You look...

27:30.944 --> 27:32.403
pretty.

27:36.825 --> 27:42.914
Don't you have something to pack?
- No, actually I'm good to go.

27:43.081 --> 27:45.333
Eli, go pack again.

27:59.389 --> 28:03.184
Got you
- You got me, Pete.

28:03.351 --> 28:07.063
You always get me, man.
- That's 'coz you smoke too much.

28:07.230 --> 28:11.901
You know, you better lay off that shit if you wanna
make babies with that lovely little woman here.

28:12.068 --> 28:15.405
Do you got something for me?
- I sure do.

28:16.614 --> 28:18.408
Absolutely.

28:20.368 --> 28:23.496
How about that? Ain't that a beaut?

28:26.624 --> 28:28.710
All of the check, huh.

28:32.714 --> 28:37.802
What the hell if she's worth it, right.
- Don't come calling me Monday saying you're hangover now.

28:37.969 --> 28:42.724
Hangover? I'd probably still be drunk.
- Oh shit, wait a minute? Do me a favor, will you?

28:42.891 --> 28:46.895
Check one, two and three
the safety guards.

28:58.448 --> 29:01.284
Where can I put these?
- Hey, you guys.

29:01.451 --> 29:03.870
What's up?
- Hey, Cecilia.

29:04.037 --> 29:07.332
What's up with the stripes?
- I have to work.

29:07.499 --> 29:11.336
Are you serious?
- Yeah, I know it sucks, I need to get rid of my tan lines.

29:11.503 --> 29:13.671
Sure, you do.

29:14.797 --> 29:16.257
Unbelievable.

29:19.969 --> 29:23.223
Have you no shame?
- Of course not, you know that.

29:23.389 --> 29:25.141
Where is Layla?

29:32.607 --> 29:34.734
Hi, Jake.
- Hey, CC.

29:34.901 --> 29:39.656
How is it? You'll have a drink from me, okay.
- Yes, ma'am. I'll have two.

29:39.823 --> 29:43.827
TJ's gonna be here at seven,
the beer's gonna be chilled on ice.

30:02.178 --> 30:04.722
Don't mind if I do.

30:13.857 --> 30:16.359
Hey, Suzie Q. You missed me?

30:30.456 --> 30:32.292
You want some?

30:50.351 --> 30:52.187
Sweet.

31:01.112 --> 31:02.947
You're good.

31:04.616 --> 31:09.454
What up, sweet Melissa? Looking sexy.

31:09.621 --> 31:12.081
You're so in shape baby, huh?

31:15.585 --> 31:19.547
Mary Jane, we meet again?

31:26.346 --> 31:29.349
What's up, baby?
Feeling a little tight today, huh.

31:29.516 --> 31:31.559
You need a little lube?

31:50.495 --> 31:52.664
Is that you, Pete?

31:54.958 --> 31:59.295
Note to self:
Drugs are bad.

32:04.509 --> 32:07.095
Out here to scream, baby.

32:24.404 --> 32:26.239
Hey, who is there?

32:47.886 --> 32:50.555
Don't make me kick your ass, man.

33:34.682 --> 33:37.143
Are you okay?

33:37.310 --> 33:42.649
First thing I wanna do when we get there,
is take a long nap in the sand.

33:42.815 --> 33:49.864
Think back with Pina Colada
just forget about everything for a while.

33:50.031 --> 33:53.284
If you need company let me know...

33:59.749 --> 34:01.918
We forgot about the beer.

34:03.545 --> 34:06.506
Wait, isn't TJ bringing the beer?

34:06.673 --> 34:08.716
Who?
- TJ.

34:09.801 --> 34:11.886
I'll call him.

34:13.304 --> 34:17.516
What's with her?
- I don't know.

34:17.684 --> 34:20.520
She's been acting weird all day.

34:33.199 --> 34:34.868
Who wants some?

34:36.369 --> 34:41.708
Come on, I'll not let them right here.
- I mean, what a lovely day to go to the beach.

34:41.875 --> 34:45.587
Hey, any word?
- No, nothing.

34:45.753 --> 34:49.007
But don't worry I gonna sort the whole
mess out when you guys are gone.

34:49.174 --> 34:53.011
Well, if you find her, will you call me?
- When I find her, you will be the first person I'll call.

34:53.178 --> 34:54.762
Thanks, Zack.

34:54.929 --> 34:58.183
Alright, you kids have fun.
- We always do.

34:58.349 --> 35:02.562
Well, not too much fun okay.  And for Christ's
sake, keep a leash on my daughter, will you?

35:02.729 --> 35:04.439
Only if it's leather.

35:13.573 --> 35:17.035
Sure you can't come?
- Miss me okay.

35:34.135 --> 35:36.304
Hey, let's see what you got?

35:38.681 --> 35:42.769
Oh Eli-e, let us see what you got.
- Loser buys beer.

35:42.936 --> 35:46.356
Come on, Eli. Don't be a pussy.
Be a tiger.

35:47.649 --> 35:52.487
Please, Jake. Not now.
- I'm not a tiger.

35:52.654 --> 35:54.489
I'm a pirate.

36:10.088 --> 36:14.259
Where is he?
- Wait, wait, wait, where is he?

36:14.425 --> 36:16.636
You're winning.

36:26.312 --> 36:28.356
Watch out.

36:49.043 --> 36:51.254
No way.

37:09.689 --> 37:12.817
Oh shit, I always had you.

37:13.902 --> 37:16.696
Yeah well, now you
have beer to go.

38:15.171 --> 38:17.215
Sandy?
- What the hell?

38:22.971 --> 38:27.851
This is our game.
- This is my friend. Jake.

38:29.102 --> 38:34.357
This is our game.
- I was gonna get you, I just forgot.

38:36.234 --> 38:40.989
What are they doing here?
- It's okay, they're cool. They're my friends.

38:41.156 --> 38:43.658
You're ruining this.

38:45.743 --> 38:47.328
What's wrong with her?

38:57.005 --> 39:00.717
It's nothing. She's cool.
- Come on, guys. Let's go.

39:06.472 --> 39:10.226
Hey Sandy, you coming or what?
- Sandy, are you okay?

39:14.689 --> 39:17.901
Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

39:18.067 --> 39:20.028
It's fun, huh?

39:30.747 --> 39:33.625
What's wrong?
- A new clerk.

39:33.791 --> 39:38.046
Hannah, you have an advantage here.
Two rounds.

39:38.213 --> 39:43.051
No way, they always card me.
- Don't look at me, I can't even grow a mustache.

39:43.218 --> 39:45.803
Oh you can't even grow a pube, Eli.

39:45.970 --> 39:48.223
What's going on?
- Strategy.

39:48.389 --> 39:53.561
I told you that we should wait for TJ.
- Guys, I got this under control.

39:53.728 --> 39:57.815
Wait, no no wait...  -- Yeah, she is.
- She isn't gonna...

40:01.903 --> 40:04.989
Can I help you?
- I sure hope so.

40:05.156 --> 40:09.452
You have something hot for me?
- We have hotdogs.

40:10.578 --> 40:12.121
I'm starving.

40:12.288 --> 40:16.543
How much?
- $1.50 for the regular, $2 for the footlong.

40:16.709 --> 40:19.921
I'll take the biggest one you got.

40:22.423 --> 40:29.097
Forgot my wallet. See.
- I guess, I can lend you some change.

40:29.264 --> 40:33.810
Well, aren't you sweet?
Wait, let me help you.

40:33.977 --> 40:37.605
What are you doing?
- What's this?

40:37.772 --> 40:39.274
Oh my...

41:16.978 --> 41:20.732
Holy shit, she's gonna screw that dude.
- So what? He's hot.

41:23.151 --> 41:28.323
I don't need to see that.
- Wait, is nobody bothered by this?

41:29.741 --> 41:35.038
Why would this bother us?
She's getting naked.

41:36.873 --> 41:42.879
How can she do this to TJ?
- What's with you? You're talking crazy.

41:43.046 --> 41:44.464
Me?

41:46.466 --> 41:48.301
Who the hell is TJ?

42:48.695 --> 42:50.321
Is somebody out there?

42:59.998 --> 43:02.000
Screw this.

43:45.043 --> 43:48.421
You, dude, hadn't come up yet.
Let's go.

43:52.550 --> 43:56.137
Are you okay, man?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

43:56.304 --> 44:01.142
Alright. Move your ass right at the market.
- Sure, I'm there.

44:57.407 --> 45:00.785
Somebody fucking help me.

45:20.889 --> 45:22.724
Are you ready?

45:24.934 --> 45:29.355
Where is your bike?
- I left it at the house, remember?

45:32.525 --> 45:34.152
Come on, get in.

45:37.405 --> 45:42.702
Oh my God, just hit me.
We're done, we're graduating.

45:42.869 --> 45:47.540
I'm graduating.
I'm graduating.

45:47.707 --> 45:49.125
Dude, that was awesome.
- That was awesome.

45:51.419 --> 45:56.633
Get back in the car. What the hell is going on?
- What do you mean?

45:56.799 --> 45:59.761
Yeah, Sandy, what're you talking about?
- Where's my stuff?

45:59.928 --> 46:02.680
I mean, where are the beach chairs?
Where's your bogey board?

46:04.516 --> 46:09.229
Why would you bring a freaking bogey board to the mountains?
- I have nothing to say to you.

46:09.395 --> 46:12.857
Excuse me?
- How about TJ?

46:13.024 --> 46:18.863
Who the heck is TJ?
- I don't wanna be with anybody else.

46:19.030 --> 46:22.784
Not now. Not ever. You're thrash.
- Fuck you, Sandy.

46:22.951 --> 46:27.205
Just because you're Cin"the fucking"rella doesn't
give you the right to judge the rest of us.

46:27.372 --> 46:31.292
Do me a favor, Lex and shut the fuck up.
- Jesus, Jake, wake up!

46:31.459 --> 46:35.964
You think it's just me? She thinks you're thrash too,
she thinks our whole family's garbage.

46:36.130 --> 46:39.676
Stop the car.

46:45.139 --> 46:50.395
Sandy, what the hell is going on? You're acting like a lunatic.
- You know, this is Chad's car.

46:51.896 --> 46:53.857
Who's Chad?

46:56.442 --> 47:02.782
Pretty boy asshole. The guy who drives this car.
Oh yeah, you fucked him yesterday, how about that?

47:02.949 --> 47:07.162
Sandy, come on. You're freaking me out, alright.
- She's out of her goddamn mind.

47:07.328 --> 47:08.997
Shut up.

47:10.373 --> 47:12.083
Sandy, what the fuck is going on?

47:12.250 --> 47:17.839
What is this, Jake? Is this some kind of joke.
- I don't know, Sandy. You tell me.

47:18.006 --> 47:21.342
Whatever it is, it's not very funny.

47:22.802 --> 47:24.304
Get in the car.

47:25.763 --> 47:30.226
No, wait. Dad said that I wasn't gonna let you drive.
- Eli, get in the goddamn car.

47:49.954 --> 47:53.374
This can't be possible.
- Wait, Sandy.

48:22.612 --> 48:25.657
Eli, stay here.
- Wait, maybe I should go...

48:25.824 --> 48:28.284
I said, stay here!

48:41.130 --> 48:43.883
Can you like turn the
music or something?

48:44.050 --> 48:47.929
What's wrong with her?
- She's fucked up.

48:48.096 --> 48:53.852
What are you talking about? Sandy's the smartest girl I know.
She's class president. She's going to Stanford.

48:55.061 --> 48:58.982
Well, the more perfect someone life's seems
the more fucked up they probably are.

48:59.149 --> 49:04.654
I don't know what that makes you, Mother Teresa?
- Nope, just honest.

49:04.821 --> 49:08.950
Well, at least I can figure out
what I'm worth to fucking fuck first.

49:12.036 --> 49:13.746
You're a bitch, Lex.

49:15.165 --> 49:19.377
What the fuck do you mean?
- Jesus, Hannah, chill out.

50:04.964 --> 50:06.591
Guys?

51:18.788 --> 51:21.457
It was like he was never here.

51:56.367 --> 52:02.207
Oh my God, Eli. What happened?
What are you doing?

52:11.633 --> 52:13.843
Dude, I didn't mean it.

52:34.030 --> 52:37.325
Oh shit.
- Where's Lex?

54:18.760 --> 54:20.762
Alexis?

54:26.267 --> 54:28.269
Help me.

54:35.276 --> 54:37.195
Where are you?

54:49.499 --> 54:51.459
Where are you?

55:51.936 --> 55:55.857
I'm gonna need a shovel.
To dig with anything.

55:58.026 --> 56:02.780
Sandy, are you hurt or what? What happened?
- She was right here, I swear. She was right here.

56:02.947 --> 56:05.450
Don't just stare there, help me.
- Stop it. Stop it.

56:06.576 --> 56:08.828
This can't be happening.
- Jake, what is going on?

56:08.995 --> 56:14.083
I swear, she was right here.
- Stop, stop. You're not making any sense.

56:14.250 --> 56:19.005
She was right there.
You saw it, didn't you?

56:19.172 --> 56:24.302
You were right here.
Eli, you saw it, didn't you?

56:24.469 --> 56:29.057
Saw what?
- That thing, that fucking thing who
dragged her to the goddamn ground.

56:29.224 --> 56:31.392
Dragged who?
- Lex.

56:32.477 --> 56:38.024
How can you not remember them?
Don't look at me like that.

56:38.191 --> 56:41.152
I'm not crazy.

56:53.832 --> 56:58.878
I don't wanna do this.
- Jake, you were dumber than I thought you were.

57:03.925 --> 57:07.846
What the fuck do you want?
- Nothing, sir.

57:09.055 --> 57:12.892
Nothing. Get the fuck out of my office
- But, I...

57:13.059 --> 57:16.396
Sandy's just worried
about that girl.

57:18.606 --> 57:21.901
And I told you I'd call.
- Zack, you don't understand.

57:22.068 --> 57:23.528
Shut up.

57:32.787 --> 57:34.998
Her name is Angela Smith.

57:37.417 --> 57:39.919
See, I told you I'd call.

57:44.632 --> 57:49.554
I've been talking to the school but the girl she was
looking for, yeah she dropped down, the seventh grade.

57:49.721 --> 57:54.601
This was some fucking nuns out there at the old convent.
Which if memory serves it right next to your graveyard.

57:54.767 --> 57:58.271
Case closed.
- What do you mean, case closed?

57:58.438 --> 58:04.652
I mean, the goddamn case is closed.
- People are disappearing.

58:04.819 --> 58:07.614
Jake, let's just get out of here.
- People are dying.

58:07.780 --> 58:10.366
Sandy, come on please. Let's just go.
- You have to believe me.

58:10.533 --> 58:15.038
Is she on drugs? She's on fucking drugs, isn't she?
- Nobody's on drugs, this was a bad idea. Let's go

58:15.205 --> 58:17.999
Hey, get back here.

58:22.045 --> 58:24.714
Where are you going now?
- We have to hurry.

58:24.881 --> 58:27.884
And go where?
- You heard, she lives at the convent.

58:28.051 --> 58:32.805
Yeah, not exactly what I had in mind for a Saturday night, see ya.
- You can't leave we have to stay together.

58:32.972 --> 58:37.268
And do what? Breaking to
a freaking convent? No, thanks.

58:37.435 --> 58:42.941
Are you trying to get arrested? Coz then, we should just go back inside.
- We have bigger problems than being arrested.

58:43.107 --> 58:47.779
Yeah, you got that right.
- I'm talking about Angela Smith, okay.

58:47.946 --> 58:51.616
That's it. I'm going home, bye.
- You're gonna die.

58:55.912 --> 58:57.330
It's not cool.

59:06.172 --> 59:12.720
Which is it, Sandy? You wanna help with the time
or you're gonna act like a crazy person? Coz I'm not going.

59:12.887 --> 59:16.349
Please, Hannah. I'm begging you.

59:18.601 --> 59:23.273
Maybe we should just go home.
- Can't do that.

59:23.439 --> 59:27.110
Coz this asshole is gonna
be there waiting for me.

59:27.277 --> 59:32.574
What about our house?
- Right. With her like this?

59:34.033 --> 59:39.455
Who's gonna get the blame for that?
Not you, guys.

59:39.622 --> 59:43.751
Jake, you don't understand.
- I don't understand? I don't understand what's going on.

59:43.918 --> 59:47.297
I don't understand what you want from me?

59:47.463 --> 59:51.301
or what the hell is going on
with this convent or this goddamn girl?

59:52.385 --> 59:54.679
I don't understand any of it.

01:00:04.147 --> 01:00:07.317
But if it's that important to you...

01:00:09.110 --> 01:00:10.570
I'll go.

01:00:12.071 --> 01:00:14.741
We'll all go.

01:00:14.908 --> 01:00:20.497
Not tonight.
But tomorrow morning.

01:00:23.166 --> 01:00:27.712
We have to stay together, then.
- Then we'll stay together.

01:00:27.879 --> 01:00:29.631
All of us.

01:00:47.941 --> 01:00:50.026
Anybody out there?

01:00:51.486 --> 01:00:53.571
Now, coz if there is...

01:00:56.616 --> 01:01:00.036
I'm ready, I'll take him.

01:01:01.871 --> 01:01:07.335
But seriously, though.
Whatever it is, I got your back.

01:01:07.502 --> 01:01:09.379
You know what I mean?

01:01:10.463 --> 01:01:12.715
Do you believe me, Eli?

01:01:16.678 --> 01:01:22.100
I believe that you believed it.
And that's good enough for me.

01:01:24.435 --> 01:01:28.690
I didn't really wanna go to the mountains, anyway.
- I did.

01:01:29.858 --> 01:01:33.778
Actually, I was really looking forward to it.

01:01:35.071 --> 01:01:39.450
Really? Eli?
Want no dirtbags around?

01:01:39.617 --> 01:01:42.787
Oh Jake, just you.

01:01:42.954 --> 01:01:44.789
And your ticket.

01:01:46.332 --> 01:01:51.129
Here, give this to Sandy.
- I don't know, Hannah?

01:01:51.296 --> 01:01:54.841
Oh, come on. She needs to sleep.

01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:04.017
Come here a second.

01:02:13.693 --> 01:02:17.697
Not exactly how we planned to
spend the night, is it?

01:02:21.451 --> 01:02:27.373
You remember last fall when the scouts
were all over me and I was just out of my mind.

01:02:28.416 --> 01:02:31.336
I thought I was going crazy.

01:02:31.503 --> 01:02:37.800
But the night before state you showed up
with all the wine and blankets and what did we do?

01:02:39.844 --> 01:02:44.349
We laid up in the roof and...
- fell asleep watching the stars.

01:02:44.516 --> 01:02:49.854
You showed me the best thing I could do
was just forget about everything.

01:02:50.939 --> 01:02:55.610
You were right.
- You lost the game, Jake.

01:02:55.777 --> 01:02:58.863
But I played great.

01:03:03.117 --> 01:03:04.869
Is it me?

01:03:06.704 --> 01:03:09.082
Did I do something wrong?

01:03:16.130 --> 01:03:20.009
I know I'm not what
your parents want.

01:03:21.553 --> 01:03:25.139
But I need to know
if I'm what you want.

01:03:27.225 --> 01:03:30.687
You are what I want, Jake.
I love you.

01:03:32.897 --> 01:03:34.732
I love you too.

01:03:52.750 --> 01:03:55.003
She's really out.

01:03:56.504 --> 01:04:02.051
My God. Who needs beer?
- Me.

01:04:03.928 --> 01:04:07.557
I'm gonna check out the pool.
Eli?

01:04:11.603 --> 01:04:14.814
Oh come on, walk me. Make sure I'm safe.

01:04:14.981 --> 01:04:20.612
I mean, we're all suppose to stay together.
- I can handle her. It's okay.

01:04:20.778 --> 01:04:22.322
Are you sure?

01:04:24.824 --> 01:04:26.701
Absolutely.

01:04:29.996 --> 01:04:32.332
Okay, just a sec.

01:04:45.428 --> 01:04:51.684
I'm sure you know what you're doing .
- Doing, doing. What do you mean?

01:04:53.436 --> 01:04:56.064
Someone showed me this once.

01:05:00.193 --> 01:05:02.529
What are you doing?

01:05:02.695 --> 01:05:04.572
Is that a vagina?

01:05:09.994 --> 01:05:12.247
Consider this...

01:05:14.958 --> 01:05:17.502
the keys to the kingdom.

01:05:17.669 --> 01:05:22.590
Looks like a treasure map.
- Well, sailor.

01:05:22.757 --> 01:05:27.554
You follow the arrows,
the glorious bounty awaits.

01:05:30.515 --> 01:05:33.977
That'll work?
-Only one way to find out.

01:05:35.687 --> 01:05:37.230
Ready?

01:05:39.149 --> 01:05:41.192
He's ready.

01:06:05.508 --> 01:06:10.305
It's cold.
- That's coz you're all the way over there.

01:06:12.891 --> 01:06:15.727
What if she's right?

01:06:15.894 --> 01:06:22.275
What if we're on some kind of
physical or metaphysical danger?

01:06:24.110 --> 01:06:27.489
Then we don't have any time to waste.

01:06:29.532 --> 01:06:33.536
I'm serious.
- So am I.

01:06:35.455 --> 01:06:37.957
I'm gonna move a little bit closer, okay.

01:06:42.462 --> 01:06:45.757
How come you never
asked me out, Eli?

01:06:47.759 --> 01:06:50.595
You always have a boyfriend.

01:06:52.514 --> 01:06:54.724
I would've said yes.

01:06:54.891 --> 01:07:00.396
You seem to always be with a
guy that look different from me.

01:07:03.858 --> 01:07:05.860
Can you forgive me?

01:07:13.785 --> 01:07:15.328
I forgive you.

01:07:28.341 --> 01:07:32.846
It's gonna be awesome, man.
- Here, put this in your pocket.

01:07:33.012 --> 01:07:36.474
And don't let her see it.
- What's wrong?

01:07:36.641 --> 01:07:40.436
Maybe she's a big loser like her friend.
- I'm not a loser.

01:07:40.603 --> 01:07:45.817
Sandy, I don't feel so good.
- Come on, Sandy. This was your idea.

01:07:45.984 --> 01:07:50.530
Yeah, I mean, what's the big deal?
- We're gonna be late for dinner.

01:07:50.697 --> 01:07:54.659
Yeah, whuzz.
- Everybody shut up. We're doing this, got it.

01:07:57.954 --> 01:08:00.165
Give me the paint.

01:08:11.509 --> 01:08:14.762
Easy, easy.

01:08:21.935 --> 01:08:24.272
Where did you learn that?

01:08:24.439 --> 01:08:27.984
Whatever "that" was.

01:08:31.196 --> 01:08:34.198
A gentleman never tells..

01:08:34.365 --> 01:08:39.037
Well, a gentleman could never do that either.

01:08:39.203 --> 01:08:42.499
Where are you going?
- To get us some drinks.

01:08:42.665 --> 01:08:45.919
Give you a chance to recharge.

01:08:46.085 --> 01:08:52.634
Let me guess. This is where you disappear
and leave me cold and alone.

01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:55.345
Cold? Yes.

01:08:56.513 --> 01:08:59.015
Alone? Not a chance.

01:08:59.182 --> 01:09:02.185
Oh, just so you don't forget...

01:09:12.028 --> 01:09:13.822
It's okay.

01:09:16.658 --> 01:09:19.243
Jesus Christ, Sandy.

01:09:26.667 --> 01:09:29.546
Sorry, you scared me.
- You see that sign?

01:09:29.712 --> 01:09:33.925
You break your neck,
we're ain't accountable.

01:09:40.932 --> 01:09:43.059
Oh, creep.

01:10:01.244 --> 01:10:05.081
Eli, come here, help me up.
She's gonna hurt herself, hold her up.

01:10:12.255 --> 01:10:14.924
Pull her legs.

01:10:20.430 --> 01:10:21.931
I saw that mister.

01:10:26.644 --> 01:10:29.397
I know you're there, asshole.

01:10:31.524 --> 01:10:33.943
Listen perv, don't make me call the...

01:11:51.146 --> 01:11:53.314
This isn't real.

01:11:56.359 --> 01:11:58.403
This isn't real.

01:12:00.405 --> 01:12:03.032
Please, get away.

01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:05.952
Please, get away.

01:12:39.986 --> 01:12:46.117
There's my girl. I wasn't sure if
you wanted vodka or rhum.

01:12:46.284 --> 01:12:48.328
Where is my brother?

01:13:00.507 --> 01:13:04.010
Sandy, where the hell are you?
- Eli, are you okay?

01:13:04.177 --> 01:13:07.680
No, look, mom and dad are all over me.
I can't cover for you anymore.

01:13:07.847 --> 01:13:09.808
Is Hannah with you?

01:13:12.644 --> 01:13:16.940
Meet me at the convent, okay.
- Sandy, just come home. Sheriff Mitchell stopped by the house.

01:13:17.106 --> 01:13:19.442
Please meet me there.

01:13:30.328 --> 01:13:32.413
I thought we're on a hurry.

01:14:01.401 --> 01:14:04.529
May I help?
- Sorry to bother you...

01:14:04.696 --> 01:14:08.324
I'm Sandy Channing and this is my friend...
- Jake Mitchell.

01:14:08.491 --> 01:14:11.619
The quarterback?
- Yes ma'am.

01:14:11.786 --> 01:14:17.709
Father Michael and I, we listen
to all the games on the Hi-Fi.

01:14:17.876 --> 01:14:21.838
I'm Sister Dolores. Please come in.

01:14:25.049 --> 01:14:28.678
I'm sorry sister, I know it's late.
- What can I do for you?

01:14:28.845 --> 01:14:31.598
We're here because of Angela Smith.

01:14:32.765 --> 01:14:37.520
How do you know her?
- I used to know her when I was little.

01:14:37.687 --> 01:14:41.232
Of course.
- Sister, Sandy is just concerned...

01:14:41.399 --> 01:14:45.987
Is Angela her?
- Oh, I wish she was...

01:14:46.154 --> 01:14:50.116
but it's just not practical,
I'm sure you understand.

01:14:50.283 --> 01:14:54.370
Do you know where she might be?
- At St. Mary's hospital.

01:14:54.537 --> 01:14:58.750
They're quite wonderful there.
- Is she hurt?

01:15:02.337 --> 01:15:04.714
Angela is in coma.

01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:10.929
Oh, I'm sorry.
I assumed you knew.

01:15:11.095 --> 01:15:12.722
A coma?

01:15:14.474 --> 01:15:19.896
Thank you for your time.
- Well, I could show you her room.

01:15:24.234 --> 01:15:28.154
I've kept her room just as she's left it.

01:15:28.321 --> 01:15:34.160
Her doctors say that her condition
is permanent but well one hopes...

01:15:35.453 --> 01:15:40.124
Oh well, the girls' floor...
- Mr. Mitchell can wait down here on the boys' floor.

01:15:40.291 --> 01:15:46.005
Can he come with me?
- I'll be fine. I'll stay here on the boys' floor.

01:15:47.423 --> 01:15:49.008
Please, come in.
Come in. Come in.

01:15:56.432 --> 01:16:01.980
Girls, girls, game time is over.
Ride along.

01:16:02.147 --> 01:16:06.067
Say your prayers.
I'll be there and I'll tuck you in a moment.

01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:10.864
A little rhyme I teach the children.

01:16:12.157 --> 01:16:15.910
It helps to keep the nightmares at bay.

01:16:24.919 --> 01:16:30.133
Do you believe in the devil, Mr. Mitchell?
- No, not really.

01:16:30.300 --> 01:16:35.430
Well, spend some time with these
little monsters, you'll believe.

01:16:36.723 --> 01:16:40.393
So this is Angela's room?

01:16:42.228 --> 01:16:46.649
This is a week before
it happened.

01:16:46.816 --> 01:16:50.320
Six years ago this June.

01:16:50.487 --> 01:16:57.076
How was that possible?
- Oh, I ask the Lord that every day.

01:16:58.203 --> 01:17:03.833
Doctors blamed genetics but I don't
know. She was small...

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:07.295
and weaker than
the other children.

01:17:07.462 --> 01:17:12.217
But I had faith that
God would protect her.

01:17:15.929 --> 01:17:21.726
Angela believed in her own
kind of protection.

01:17:23.353 --> 01:17:28.358
An angel?
- Faith is all-powerful.

01:17:28.525 --> 01:17:34.614
If one truly believes in something,
one will make it come true.

01:17:36.491 --> 01:17:42.497
Of course, we have to be careful
what we choose to believe in.

01:17:43.206 --> 01:17:48.127
Duty calls. Forgive me.
I'll be right back.

01:17:58.263 --> 01:18:02.809
Hey, you play any football?
- Do I play football?

01:18:02.976 --> 01:18:04.811
Toss here, kid.

01:18:06.354 --> 01:18:11.234
You see this arm? In Jefferson County,
it's worth more than your life.

01:18:14.112 --> 01:18:17.031
Nice arm. For a girl.

01:18:18.116 --> 01:18:20.034
Kid, hey kid.

01:18:46.102 --> 01:18:48.062
You gotta be kidding me?

01:18:55.236 --> 01:18:58.615
Hey kid, I've got your ball.

01:19:05.622 --> 01:19:07.874
Speak, you little bastard.

01:19:36.986 --> 01:19:38.738
What are you doing?

01:19:41.741 --> 01:19:45.453
Did you know about these?
- What are they?

01:19:45.620 --> 01:19:48.289
Why would she draw these?

01:19:49.791 --> 01:19:52.627
Those can't be Angela's.

01:20:04.931 --> 01:20:06.891
Just in case.

01:20:13.273 --> 01:20:14.983
Hey kid, is that you?

01:20:18.111 --> 01:20:22.157
What is this thing?
- I don't know.

01:20:23.741 --> 01:20:25.410
Whatever it is...

01:20:27.162 --> 01:20:28.872
it's real.

01:22:26.698 --> 01:22:29.200
What in God's name?

01:22:33.621 --> 01:22:35.498
Who are you?

01:22:42.630 --> 01:22:46.384
He's gone.

01:22:48.428 --> 01:22:54.100
What happened? Are you okay?
- It's too late. It's too late.

01:22:55.226 --> 01:22:58.313
Look at this.
- I don't understand. What's going on?

01:22:58.480 --> 01:23:02.317
It is the ghost.
- Ghost? What ghost?

01:23:02.484 --> 01:23:05.778
From the game.
- Who are you?

01:23:05.945 --> 01:23:09.741
You're not Angela's friend.
What do you want from her?

01:23:09.908 --> 01:23:13.077
She's suffered enough.
- You get out of here.

01:23:13.244 --> 01:23:16.873
Leave the poor girl in peace.
- God sees you, Ms. Channing.

01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:19.584
God sees everything.

01:23:27.842 --> 01:23:33.473
Who was that lady? And what the hell were you doing
out here in the middle of the freaking night?

01:23:34.557 --> 01:23:38.812
It doesn't matter anymore.
They're all gone, it's over.

01:23:38.978 --> 01:23:43.149
Sandy, nobody knows where you've been.

01:23:45.068 --> 01:23:49.072
If you're in some kind of trouble,
you can talk to me.

01:23:49.239 --> 01:23:54.118
It doesn't matter anymore, Eli. It doesn't matter.
- Stop saying that.

01:23:58.915 --> 01:24:01.709
It matters to me.

01:24:02.794 --> 01:24:07.090
You're my sister, okay.
If something is going on, please tell me.

01:24:07.257 --> 01:24:09.300
So I can help you.

01:24:10.802 --> 01:24:12.679
You can trust me.

01:24:14.055 --> 01:24:18.476
You know that, right?
- I want you to listen to me, okay.

01:24:18.643 --> 01:24:23.231
You do know that I love you and
I would never lie to you ever.

01:24:23.398 --> 01:24:28.027
But what I'm about tell you is gonna sound
like the craziest thing in the world, because it is.

01:24:28.194 --> 01:24:32.365
And I know you're not gonna believe me, because
nobody believes me. But I need you to believe, Eli.

01:24:32.532 --> 01:24:34.075
I'm listening.

01:24:36.202 --> 01:24:39.956
When we're little, we used to
play games, you remember?

01:24:40.123 --> 01:24:44.919
In the graveyard?
- There was a girl, an orphan. Her name was Angela.

01:24:46.546 --> 01:24:53.678
Last night we played the game again, but we
weren't alone. Six people are with us, Eli.

01:24:53.845 --> 01:25:00.185
Six of our friends, and I know you don't remember them,
but they were there and now they're gone.

01:25:01.352 --> 01:25:05.523
Gone? What do you mean gone?
- Something...

01:25:05.690 --> 01:25:08.568
This thing took them.

01:25:10.445 --> 01:25:15.909
This thing is connected to
Angela and the game?

01:25:16.075 --> 01:25:18.036
It has to be.

01:25:34.093 --> 01:25:38.848
I knew you wouldn't believe me.
- I believe you.

01:25:42.894 --> 01:25:46.731
I believe you.
Why would you make it up?

01:25:46.898 --> 01:25:49.150
I wouldn't.

01:26:14.634 --> 01:26:20.682
Let's figure this out. The game.
What are the rules of the game?

01:26:20.849 --> 01:26:26.271
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
- Release the one ignored by heaven.

01:26:26.437 --> 01:26:28.648
That's Angela, right?

01:26:28.815 --> 01:26:33.611
eight, nine, ten, now run and hide
or join her at the devil's side.

01:26:33.778 --> 01:26:36.573
That's obvious.

01:26:36.739 --> 01:26:42.120
eleven comes, the clock will chime
forgotten souls erased by time.

01:26:44.664 --> 01:26:50.378
That's it. Erased. Okay, that's it.
Erased by time. That makes sense now.

01:26:50.545 --> 01:26:55.550
Okay, it doesn't make any sense at all,
but I think I know why.

01:26:57.760 --> 01:27:03.391
People are gone.
People I knew?

01:27:03.558 --> 01:27:08.605
You didn't just know them Eli they were your
best friends and now one by one they've been...

01:27:08.771 --> 01:27:10.315
Erased.

01:27:15.487 --> 01:27:17.739
Alright, so how does it end? Midnight comes...

01:27:17.906 --> 01:27:22.118
It's not too late.
- So kill the ghost or seal your fate.

01:27:22.285 --> 01:27:26.206
God, she's still alive. Angela's still alive.

01:27:26.372 --> 01:27:29.250
What does that mean?
- It means she has to die.

01:27:29.417 --> 01:27:31.044
Who has to die?

01:27:32.462 --> 01:27:35.298
What's going on?
- Dad...

01:27:37.550 --> 01:27:42.222
We've been really worried about you.
- Step aside, son.

01:27:42.388 --> 01:27:45.767
Wait.
- You're sick, honey.

01:27:45.934 --> 01:27:50.021
She didn't do anything wrong.
- No, sweetheart. She just needs some help.

01:27:50.188 --> 01:27:54.526
No, no. You're not going anywhere, alright. Sit down.
- Let go.

01:27:56.027 --> 01:27:58.696
You don't understand, please.

01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:09.457
It's gonna be okay, honey.
- You'll get back to normal in no time.

01:28:09.624 --> 01:28:12.418
We're gonna take very good
care of you, Ms. Channing.

01:28:12.585 --> 01:28:15.338
Sandy, I'm here. I'm right here.
- Step aside.

01:28:19.634 --> 01:28:22.220
For Christ's sake. Somebody hold him down.
- Sandy, tell me what to do?

01:28:22.387 --> 01:28:27.016
Kill the ghost or seal your fate.
- What is she saying?

01:28:27.183 --> 01:28:30.436
Kill her?
- Kill her.

01:28:30.603 --> 01:28:32.021
You can't go any further.

01:28:34.107 --> 01:28:38.278
I'll do it, Sandy. I'll do it.

01:29:06.389 --> 01:29:08.141
Midnight.

01:29:10.643 --> 01:29:15.440
Stop. Let me go.
Let me go.

01:29:19.068 --> 01:29:24.449
Eli? Where is Eli?
- What is she saying?

01:29:24.616 --> 01:29:27.952
Who's Eli, honey?
- Is Eli one of her friends?

01:29:29.662 --> 01:29:36.002
Sandy doesn't have any friends.
- Go to sleep, honey. We'll be here when you wake up.

01:29:37.754 --> 01:29:39.339
Angela Smith.

01:29:43.009 --> 01:29:47.180
That's strange.
Angela Smith is a patient here.

01:29:56.689 --> 01:29:59.275
I thought we could play the game?

01:29:59.442 --> 01:30:03.404
Who's playing?
- Just us.

01:30:17.418 --> 01:30:20.380
I'm sorry about last time.

01:30:22.340 --> 01:30:24.843
It's getting late. We should play.

01:30:33.935 --> 01:30:39.023
Maybe we shouldn't play.
- No, I want to play.

01:30:39.190 --> 01:30:41.442
Wait. Who's the ghost?

01:30:43.319 --> 01:30:44.737
You are.

01:30:46.114 --> 01:30:51.744
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
release the one ignored by heaven.

01:30:54.205 --> 01:30:56.207
Run.

01:31:00.170 --> 01:31:02.338
Help me.

01:31:17.061 --> 01:31:18.897
Midnight.

01:31:37.790 --> 01:31:40.793
Look at that shit.

01:31:58.436 --> 01:32:00.396
Who did this?

01:35:09.252 --> 01:35:11.588
I know what I've done...

01:35:17.886 --> 01:35:20.805
but I also know what you've done.

01:37:45.033 --> 01:37:47.577
You wanna play a game?

01:37:50.371 --> 01:37:56.085
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
release the one ignored by heaven.

01:37:56.252 --> 01:37:59.506
eight, nine, ten, now run and hide
or join her at the devil's side.

01:37:59.672 --> 01:38:04.677
I remember you. I remember everything.
- Eleven comes, the clock will chime
forgotten souls erased by time.

01:38:04.844 --> 01:38:09.057
I'm so sorry.
- Midnight comes, it's not too late
so kill the ghost or seal your fate!

01:38:09.224 --> 01:38:12.894
Please. I was your bestfriend.

01:38:16.773 --> 01:38:23.196
All I wanted was you.
- I'll never forget you. I promise.

01:38:35.166 --> 01:38:38.086
Friends forever. Is that it?

01:39:04.112 --> 01:39:06.406
Well look at you.

01:39:08.283 --> 01:39:09.909
It's a miracle.
