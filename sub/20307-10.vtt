WEBVTT

00:04.504 --> 00:05.839
Everything's okay.

00:06.631 --> 00:08.883
-No?
-No spotting. Everything's okay.

00:08.967 --> 00:11.136
I still think you ought to stay in bed.

00:11.219 --> 00:12.429
I'm gonna.

00:12.512 --> 00:14.764
At least until the doctor calls.

00:14.848 --> 00:16.850
At least until the doctor calls.

00:19.060 --> 00:20.353
Now what are you doing?

00:20.437 --> 00:22.480
Setting things up for you.

00:22.564 --> 00:24.649
-(grunts)
-Next you're gonna get out a bedpan

00:24.733 --> 00:26.693
and if you do that,
I'm gonna bop you in the nose.

00:26.776 --> 00:29.112
No, I'm not gonna get out a bedpan next.

00:29.195 --> 00:32.615
Next, I'm just gonna love you
and feel real happy.

00:33.616 --> 00:35.952
If I skip the Olympics,
I'll be home by 3:00.

00:36.036 --> 00:36.995
Oh, no you don't.

00:37.078 --> 00:40.040
I don't want them calling up
and blaming me 'cause they lost on account

00:40.123 --> 00:44.335
-of you weren't there for the rope climb.
-I hate climbing ropes. I'm lousy at it.

00:44.419 --> 00:46.838
No sale. Go for the gold, racer.

00:55.138 --> 00:58.558
You know what this place needs?
A Christmas tree.

00:58.641 --> 01:02.228
Okay, let's settle down! Item one.

01:02.312 --> 01:06.649
Ahh. Christmas comes,
I feel like a glorified personnel officer.

01:06.733 --> 01:10.111
-(laughter)
-Okay. Starting at the top.

01:10.195 --> 01:13.239
Captain Furillo's gonna get
a head start on a holiday weekend.

01:13.323 --> 01:14.699
He's taking a personal day.

01:14.783 --> 01:16.993
Lieutenant Goldblume's
gonna be in command.

01:17.077 --> 01:19.537
Now, reassigns and overtimes.

01:19.621 --> 01:22.916
Night tour officers: Coleman and Samovitz,

01:22.999 --> 01:25.960
Lewis and Dulles, Craig and Kramer.

01:26.044 --> 01:28.254
They all pair today
on account of half-tours

01:28.338 --> 01:31.174
and personal days by certain individuals

01:31.257 --> 01:33.635
that you hear grunting and groaning

01:33.718 --> 01:36.221
in the boiler <i>hyphen</i> weight room.

01:36.304 --> 01:37.639
(laughter)

01:37.722 --> 01:40.809
Now, this is our Hill Street contingent,

01:40.892 --> 01:43.103
getting their last lap of conditioning

01:43.186 --> 01:48.525
for the first annual Hill Street
firemen versus cops Benefit Olympics.

01:48.608 --> 01:51.069
(cheering and shouting)

01:51.152 --> 01:54.489
This stellar event
is gonna take place today,

01:54.572 --> 01:56.032
Friday, at 3:00 p.m.,

01:56.116 --> 02:01.412
in the men's gymnasium of P.S. 114
Dekker and 127th.

02:01.496 --> 02:05.041
Proceeds to the Youth Organization
for the Christmas Needy.

02:05.125 --> 02:08.461
Now, yours truly just happens to have

02:08.545 --> 02:12.674
a few advance ducats available at a deuce.

02:12.757 --> 02:15.885
Now, contributions at the door
are gonna be $2.75.

02:15.969 --> 02:19.389
Folks, this is something
definitely worth going into your pocket.

02:19.472 --> 02:21.975
Not just because the cause is worthy,

02:22.058 --> 02:24.310
but to see which of our people
is gonna live.

02:24.394 --> 02:26.104
(laughter)

02:26.187 --> 02:29.440
How many do you want? Two? Good.

02:29.524 --> 02:31.401
Wish I could be down there with you guys,

02:31.484 --> 02:33.278
but... doctor's orders.

02:33.361 --> 02:36.489
J.D., will you stop blowing
that cigarette smoke in my face? Please!

02:36.573 --> 02:39.075
Hey, don't be such a fanatic, Renko.

02:39.159 --> 02:41.244
As your non-playing captain/coach,

02:41.327 --> 02:44.581
I ask you to be practical
in your expectations, gentlemen.

02:44.664 --> 02:47.876
We cannot expect to overcome
years of inactivity

02:47.959 --> 02:50.587
with one burst of exercise here

02:50.670 --> 02:52.755
in preparation for this athletic contest.

02:52.839 --> 02:55.884
JOE: Way to be a real optimist, uh,
Lieutenant.

02:55.967 --> 02:58.928
I was just thinking realistically, Joseph.

02:59.929 --> 03:01.514
Uh, rump down.

03:01.598 --> 03:03.850
I got to do it this time, Bobby Hill.

03:03.933 --> 03:07.770
I can feel it a complete reintorientation
of my lifestyle.

03:07.854 --> 03:10.440
-Yeah, I heard that before.
-I just cannot believe the kind of shape

03:10.523 --> 03:12.025
my corpus has gotten into.

03:12.108 --> 03:15.278
Tell me about it, Renko.
I'm lucky if I can do 50 of these.

03:15.361 --> 03:17.947
I remember I could do a hundred
without even breaking a sweat.

03:18.031 --> 03:19.407
-Me too!
-(laughs)

03:19.490 --> 03:20.825
Yeah, in a week, maybe.

03:21.492 --> 03:23.953
You know, I used to do a hundred push-ups

03:24.037 --> 03:26.289
every morning before
I sat down to breakfast.

03:26.372 --> 03:29.709
-I hope lying ain't a sin, Renko.
-That's good. Those wrist curls.

03:29.792 --> 03:32.462
That's very good for that
arm-wrestling event, Andrew.

03:32.545 --> 03:35.340
You just listen to me,
Charles Atlas Coffey,

03:35.965 --> 03:37.592
I may look like I'm out of shape,

03:37.675 --> 03:41.095
but I have more raw, brute muscle power

03:41.179 --> 03:43.681
than you ever had in your entire lifetime.

03:44.390 --> 03:46.476
All right, Renko, come on.
Show me what you can do.

03:46.559 --> 03:49.103
Gentlemen, let's save
our competitive instincts

03:49.187 --> 03:50.939
for the Hill Street firefighters.

03:51.022 --> 03:52.482
Hey, Renko, come on.

03:53.274 --> 03:55.485
What do you wanna do,
clean and jerk this sucker here?

03:55.568 --> 03:58.404
180 pounds? You wanna start that low?

03:58.488 --> 04:00.073
Yeah. I'll start right where it is.

04:00.156 --> 04:02.909
-Renko! Remember...
-(groans)

04:02.992 --> 04:04.202
...your groin.

04:04.285 --> 04:06.704
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

04:06.788 --> 04:08.915
<i>-Armed robbery in progress.</i>
-(sirens whooping)

04:08.998 --> 04:12.961
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner of People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

04:19.926 --> 04:23.346
(theme music playing)

06:04.405 --> 06:06.366
Yeah. Right.

06:08.993 --> 06:11.287
(chuckles) All right, yeah,
I'll check him out,

06:11.371 --> 06:13.748
and if he's selling dope,
I'll pop him, all right?

06:13.831 --> 06:17.460
Yeah, okay, uh? Mrs. Franklin, right.

06:17.543 --> 06:20.254
Okay, I got it. Yeah. Yeah. Goodbye.

06:20.338 --> 06:22.215
(indistinct chattering)

06:28.262 --> 06:30.181
Complaint on a guy selling dope.

06:30.264 --> 06:31.516
-The address?
-I got it.

06:32.850 --> 06:34.727
They got Spinelli on that list,
Lieutenant?

06:34.811 --> 06:36.062
In due course, J.D.

06:36.145 --> 06:38.272
SARGE: Oh, LaRue, telephone.

06:38.356 --> 06:41.401
I think you'll find the roster
we've submitted for the Benefit Olympics

06:41.484 --> 06:45.363
squares with our personnel,
Inspector Bascomb, except, of course,

06:45.446 --> 06:47.615
for the one allowable guest athlete.

06:47.698 --> 06:49.867
Yeah. Who you guys gonna use?

06:49.951 --> 06:53.246
(laughs) My dear Inspector Bascomb,

06:53.329 --> 06:55.373
surely you don't expect me to reveal

06:55.456 --> 06:57.083
our hole card at this junction.

06:57.166 --> 06:59.085
Yeah, who's the fire
department bringing in?

06:59.168 --> 07:02.547
My dear Policeman, uh,
Coffey... forget it.

07:05.299 --> 07:07.844
-Joe.
-Hey, slugger. How you feeling? You ready?

07:07.927 --> 07:09.679
I'm fine, except I'm not gonna do it,

07:09.762 --> 07:12.014
and I want you to tell
the lieutenant for me. Thanks.

07:12.098 --> 07:13.683
Hey, what's wrong?

07:13.766 --> 07:15.935
Nothing's wrong,
I just don't wanna spend my day off

07:16.018 --> 07:17.311
doing a tug-of-war.

07:17.395 --> 07:20.606
-You know, you are just like clockwork.
-What does that mean?

07:20.690 --> 07:24.193
It gets closer to Christmas,
and you start bumming yourself out.

07:24.277 --> 07:26.863
What are you gonna do?
You gonna go home and stare at the walls?

07:26.946 --> 07:30.116
I've got to finish my Christmas shopping,
Dr. Know-It-All!

07:30.199 --> 07:31.784
Well, ho ho ho to you, too, Luce!

07:31.868 --> 07:33.953
Can you get him down here by noon, Sid?

07:34.036 --> 07:37.039
Beautiful. Oh, you are aces.

07:37.123 --> 07:39.083
Sidney, there will be
a little something extra

07:39.167 --> 07:41.127
in your Christmas stocking.

07:41.210 --> 07:43.921
Lieutenant, I think we got
a late scratch on Sergeant Bates.

07:44.005 --> 07:45.423
What, feminine indisposition?

07:45.506 --> 07:48.050
I think it's more like
Christmas blahs or something.

07:48.134 --> 07:51.471
Oh, um, well, we'll be making
a roster substitution

07:51.554 --> 07:54.640
for Sergeant Bates
in the tug-of-war, Inspector.

07:54.724 --> 07:56.434
Other than the guest athlete,

07:56.517 --> 07:59.270
all participants must be
on the rolls of the precinct.

07:59.353 --> 08:00.730
Mahoney from night shift.

08:00.813 --> 08:03.691
Okay, then substitute for Sergeant Bates

08:03.774 --> 08:05.693
is Officer William Mahoney.

08:05.776 --> 08:06.986
Sid says he can deliver,

08:07.069 --> 08:09.864
says this guy makes
Arnold Schwarzenegger look normal.

08:09.947 --> 08:12.617
-Sid gets carried away sometimes.
-Hey, Inspector.

08:12.700 --> 08:15.995
How would the fire department feel
about a little side bet on the tug-of-war?

08:16.078 --> 08:18.664
-What kind of side bet?
-A bet. You know, like, with currency?

08:18.748 --> 08:21.125
Detective, these Benefit Olympics
have been organized

08:21.209 --> 08:22.376
to a charitable purpose.

08:22.460 --> 08:24.921
Give me a break,
we're gonna be one of the charities.

08:25.004 --> 08:27.465
What do you say?
I'm sure you fire guys are bringing in

08:27.548 --> 08:30.510
some ace guest athlete,
plus you're all such hunks yourselves.

08:30.593 --> 08:32.470
We could probably be had on a side bet.

08:32.553 --> 08:35.515
-$200 to the winning team?
-And half the proceeds to the Youth Fund?

08:35.598 --> 08:39.143
-$500.
-Whoa, sounds like a confident man, J.D.

08:39.227 --> 08:40.811
Now, I don't doubt the city's finest,

08:40.895 --> 08:43.731
but we'll expect to see
the dough before the event.

08:43.814 --> 08:45.233
Wouldn't have it any other way.

08:45.316 --> 08:47.693
Gentlemen, I'll see you at P.S. 114.

08:47.777 --> 08:49.403
Absolutely.

08:49.487 --> 08:52.114
J.D., you sure our ringer's
better than their ringer?

08:52.198 --> 08:54.992
Domestic, Joseph.
Why don't you ride with Silva?

08:55.576 --> 08:57.662
J.D., what's the angle, man?

08:57.745 --> 09:00.122
I'm gonna say one word to you guys.

09:00.206 --> 09:03.167
Mr. Baltimore Speedway.

09:06.629 --> 09:08.798
-Clear it out! Clear it out!
-No! No!

09:08.881 --> 09:10.967
Get out so I can get in here, now!

09:11.050 --> 09:14.178
-No. You don't wanna do this, believe me!
-Believe me, I wanna do it!

09:14.262 --> 09:17.390
-Hey, hey, hey! What's the problem, now?
-I'm the landlord.

09:17.473 --> 09:19.600
These people are five months
behind in their rent.

09:19.684 --> 09:21.435
They've got their notice of eviction.

09:21.519 --> 09:24.063
I'm trying to make repairs
so I can re-rent!

09:24.146 --> 09:26.107
He doesn't want to make repairs!

09:26.190 --> 09:28.442
He wants to come in
so he can destroy the virgin!

09:28.526 --> 09:31.862
-That's what he wants to do!
-First thing, we put down the wood, okay?

09:32.947 --> 09:33.823
Now,

09:34.824 --> 09:36.909
now, what is this virgin
that's being destroyed?

09:36.993 --> 09:38.953
The virgin that is in my apartment.

09:39.036 --> 09:41.122
-He wants to destroy it.
-You don't know this guy.

09:41.205 --> 09:44.875
(speaking in Spanish)

09:44.959 --> 09:47.086
He said the Holy Virgin
appeared in his apartment.

09:47.169 --> 09:49.422
(speaking in Spanish)

09:50.673 --> 09:52.675
What does that have to do
with paying the rent?

09:52.758 --> 09:54.302
You don't believe me, huh?

09:54.385 --> 09:55.845
Come in and I'll show you.

09:55.928 --> 09:58.598
-That's not the point.
-That is the point.

09:58.681 --> 10:00.641
Come in and take a look, please.

10:04.437 --> 10:06.731
(onlookers praying in Spanish)

10:08.983 --> 10:12.445
You see? <i>Mira.</i>
Look at the sadness in her eyes.

10:12.528 --> 10:14.238
She suffers for all of us!

10:14.322 --> 10:17.199
And he wants to paint
her over so that we'll go!

10:17.283 --> 10:20.620
-It's a stain from the water upstairs.
-No, it was a miracle, you understand?

10:20.703 --> 10:22.580
Whatever this is,
it doesn't change the fact

10:22.663 --> 10:23.914
that you owe back rent.

10:23.998 --> 10:26.834
This man has the right to throw you out
if you don't pay him his dough.

10:26.917 --> 10:29.462
Look, people give money
so she will be safe.

10:29.545 --> 10:31.797
Yesterday, $2. Today, another $2.

10:31.881 --> 10:33.549
That's great, I'm rich.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.259
Look, four bucks ain't gonna make it.

10:35.343 --> 10:36.761
I did everything for this man.

10:36.844 --> 10:38.804
I'm a businessman, I'm not a janitor!

10:38.888 --> 10:40.514
Businessman? What's your business?

10:40.598 --> 10:42.516
Before this,
he was selling stupid vitamins!

10:42.600 --> 10:43.601
All right, look, look.

10:43.684 --> 10:46.896
It's Christmas, and I don't
wanna make busts here, okay?

10:48.314 --> 10:51.275
Now, if this man can find work
and start paying full rent,

10:51.359 --> 10:53.277
plus a little something on what he owes...

10:53.361 --> 10:55.738
If he did that,
I would worship at the water stains.

10:55.821 --> 10:58.532
Meanwhile, I called the marshals.
They will be here at 5:00.

10:58.616 --> 11:01.077
I'm saying if he gets work by 5:00.

11:01.160 --> 11:03.829
If he gets work,
make a dent in what he owes.

11:03.913 --> 11:05.790
-All right, you hear that?
<i>-Entiendes</i>?

11:05.873 --> 11:07.124
<i>Sí.</i>

11:07.208 --> 11:09.585
Now, you promise me
not to hurt the Virgin, meantime?

11:09.669 --> 11:11.587
Listen to him with the Virgin! Dreamer!

11:12.380 --> 11:13.506
Not if you get work.

11:13.589 --> 11:16.801
(speaking in Spanish)

11:22.890 --> 11:23.974
Can't hurt, huh?

11:28.062 --> 11:29.772
JOYCE: We're getting close, aren't we?

11:29.855 --> 11:30.940
How could you tell?

11:31.816 --> 11:33.776
I can feel you getting nervous.

11:33.859 --> 11:35.486
(laughs)

11:35.569 --> 11:38.447
(sighs) I'm nervous too, Frank.

11:40.199 --> 11:42.660
Tell me one more time
why we're doing this.

11:43.411 --> 11:45.746
Somebody had to make the first move.

11:47.415 --> 11:48.708
It's been five years.

11:49.542 --> 11:53.212
You think five years has changed
what they feel about your divorce?

11:55.673 --> 11:57.258
I don't honestly know.

11:58.467 --> 11:59.552
I hope so.

12:00.010 --> 12:01.220
Join the club.

12:08.436 --> 12:09.770
They've repainted it.

12:30.332 --> 12:32.042
Frank! Frank!

12:32.126 --> 12:35.004
Frank! Oh, Frank! (laughs)

12:35.087 --> 12:37.631
Oh, you're here now! I'm so happy!

12:37.715 --> 12:38.674
Mama.

12:40.384 --> 12:41.469
Joyce.

12:41.552 --> 12:42.970
Hello, Mrs. Furillo.

12:43.053 --> 12:44.847
No, please, I'm Barbara.

12:44.930 --> 12:47.683
It's been so long. Too long!

12:47.767 --> 12:49.518
(speaking in Italian)

12:49.602 --> 12:50.895
How's Pop?

12:50.978 --> 12:52.480
He's fine. He's at work.

12:52.563 --> 12:54.231
He's so excited about seeing you!

12:54.315 --> 12:56.567
You told me on the phone
he was taking a day off.

12:56.650 --> 13:00.154
He wanted to, but they called
and you know how it is,

13:00.237 --> 13:02.114
there's always something
to do at the plant.

13:02.198 --> 13:04.617
But he's coming later.
Come on, let's go inside.

13:15.002 --> 13:18.756
Let's try to maintain ourselves
away from legal entanglements

13:18.839 --> 13:20.966
so we can make that Benefit Olympics.

13:21.050 --> 13:22.218
There's Buntz.

13:24.762 --> 13:26.263
(turkey squawking)

13:30.434 --> 13:31.977
How's it going, there, Lieutenant?

13:32.061 --> 13:34.396
(laughs) Listen, you wanna
drive around the corner,

13:34.480 --> 13:35.856
pull up in front of that church?

13:35.940 --> 13:37.566
-What's the turkey for?
-(laughs)

13:37.650 --> 13:39.652
This is our new narc, Officer Giblet.

13:39.735 --> 13:42.613
You need two guys as witnesses
to some probable cause.

13:42.696 --> 13:44.740
(laughing)

13:50.037 --> 13:51.288
Hold it right there!

13:51.372 --> 13:52.456
Freeze! All right!

13:52.540 --> 13:54.458
Come on, get up there!

13:55.501 --> 13:57.545
Jerk we want's in the lizard coat.

13:57.628 --> 14:00.756
Lady from the church bazaar
said she knows he's a pusher.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.049
Did she see him selling?

14:02.132 --> 14:04.718
If she saw him, we wouldn't
need the bird, right?

14:04.802 --> 14:06.428
All right, turn around, there!

14:06.512 --> 14:08.222
All right, boys.

14:10.766 --> 14:12.852
Hey, man, I ain't no farmer.

14:13.978 --> 14:16.105
Throw that bird back in the oven
where it should be.

14:16.188 --> 14:18.399
Oh, no, you got it wrong, pal.

14:18.482 --> 14:22.820
This here is a scientifically-trained
dope-sniffing turkey,

14:22.903 --> 14:24.488
Officer Giblet.

14:24.572 --> 14:25.906
Huh? (chuckling)

14:25.990 --> 14:27.283
Whoa, yeah. Whoa!

14:27.366 --> 14:28.576
(laughing)

14:28.659 --> 14:31.078
The officer here
is starting to take the scent.

14:31.161 --> 14:34.164
He is vibrating like
a fatso in a candy store, huh?

14:34.248 --> 14:36.166
He is kinda vibrating, isn't he?

14:36.250 --> 14:37.334
Funny now, Renko,

14:37.418 --> 14:39.753
but guess whose name
goes down on this report?

14:40.629 --> 14:42.673
I, uh, I hope nobody is holding here,

14:42.756 --> 14:46.176
because, uh, when a turk hones in,
he goes kinda nuts.

14:46.260 --> 14:48.095
Look at him, he's vibrating there.

14:48.178 --> 14:49.972
Well, I don't swing with no dope,

14:50.055 --> 14:52.141
except for a little
cough syrup, now and then.

14:52.224 --> 14:56.145
-He don't mind that, does he?
-I don't know. Let's find out here, huh?

14:58.898 --> 15:02.943
There you go, Officer Giblet.
Okay, he's clean.

15:03.027 --> 15:03.986
Get out of here!

15:04.069 --> 15:06.822
-Let's try this next dude here.
-I ain't afraid of no turkey.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.866
No? Then how come you're sweating?

15:11.785 --> 15:13.913
That bird don't smell drugs! He's on them!

15:14.872 --> 15:16.206
(turkey squawking)

15:16.290 --> 15:17.917
Oh, boy, he's shaking.

15:18.500 --> 15:21.086
(laughs) Whoa-ho, boy! Oh, boy!

15:21.170 --> 15:25.466
Oh, yeah, he's hot!
The officer is very hot!

15:25.549 --> 15:28.510
Okay, let's see.
Let's start up here at the head.

15:28.594 --> 15:30.804
Let's let him sniff the brain
a little bit here, huh?

15:30.888 --> 15:33.182
Man! The hell with this!

15:33.265 --> 15:34.975
Hey, you get back up against that fence!

15:35.059 --> 15:37.937
That's flight, suspicion, probable cause.

15:38.020 --> 15:39.355
Turn around and face that bird!

15:40.940 --> 15:43.067
BUNTZ: All right. Ah-ha!

15:43.150 --> 15:45.402
Heh-hey, this man is a traveling pharmacy!

15:45.486 --> 15:47.655
Officer, would you
bust this man here, please?

15:47.738 --> 15:49.156
Turn around and face that fence!

15:49.823 --> 15:52.826
-(chuckling) Put your hands down there.
-What's that, Officer Giblet?

15:52.910 --> 15:54.370
Oh, you say, uh...

15:54.453 --> 15:58.332
You say you got a bust to make
over at the Heights this afternoon?

15:58.415 --> 15:59.959
All right, I'll see ya, huh?

16:00.042 --> 16:03.462
-RENKO: You have the right to...
-(laughing) Go on, take off.

16:04.463 --> 16:06.382
-Christmas eats!
-(chuckling)

16:06.465 --> 16:09.885
-(laughter)
-Ho ho ho! Whoa!

16:11.303 --> 16:12.554
My father carved these.

16:13.681 --> 16:14.807
My first duck hunt,

16:15.557 --> 16:16.684
I shot the decoy.

16:16.767 --> 16:18.435
(laughs)

16:18.519 --> 16:20.187
I'm not sure Pop ever forgave me.

16:20.270 --> 16:22.022
Of course he does!

16:23.524 --> 16:24.900
Something looks different.

16:26.068 --> 16:29.196
Oh, we enlarged the doorway
to the dining room.

16:29.279 --> 16:32.199
You can't stay away five years
and expect to find nothing's changed!

16:34.660 --> 16:36.954
Look at this. Look.

16:37.037 --> 16:38.455
Fay sent this.

16:38.539 --> 16:42.668
That boy, I'm telling you,
he has an artistic talent,

16:42.751 --> 16:43.919
just like Grandfather.

16:44.003 --> 16:46.005
Frank Jr. took this?
He never mentioned it.

16:46.088 --> 16:49.174
Yeah, he won the school photo contest.

16:49.258 --> 16:52.344
Fay called. By the way,
Fay calls every week.

16:52.428 --> 16:55.305
-(doorbell rings)
-So, we know what Frank Jr.'s doing.

16:59.435 --> 17:01.603
-Hi!
-Hey, come on, kids!

17:01.687 --> 17:03.188
Come here, baby.

17:03.272 --> 17:05.024
Go give Uncle Frank a nice, big kiss!

17:05.107 --> 17:06.525
FRANK: Remember me, Tommy?

17:07.735 --> 17:08.736
Hi, sweetie.

17:08.819 --> 17:10.279
Hi, Mama, how are you?

17:10.362 --> 17:12.406
(indistinct conversations)

17:12.489 --> 17:13.741
-Merry Christmas.
-Frank!

17:13.824 --> 17:16.201
Oh, good to see you! Merry Christmas.

17:16.285 --> 17:17.619
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.

17:17.703 --> 17:21.248
-Stella, take your sister, all right?
-I want you to meet my wife, Joyce.

17:21.331 --> 17:22.583
-Hi!
-Merry Christmas.

17:22.666 --> 17:25.419
-I'm Tommy!
-Hi, Tommy. Merry Christmas.

17:25.502 --> 17:26.503
And who's this?

17:26.587 --> 17:27.838
She can't talk yet.

17:27.921 --> 17:30.758
She can't-- (laughs) Merry Christmas.

17:30.841 --> 17:32.301
Look at this guy!

17:33.552 --> 17:36.555
A couple of years younger,
and <i>I'm</i> fighting a gut!

17:36.638 --> 17:38.140
Have you got him in training or what?

17:39.308 --> 17:40.893
So, what do you think, Frank?

17:40.976 --> 17:43.145
Last time I saw you, it was just Tommy.

17:43.228 --> 17:44.229
You've been busy.

17:44.313 --> 17:47.441
-You better get busy. I'm way ahead.
-Don't you worry.

17:47.524 --> 17:50.235
Frank is gonna have a family
as big as yours, right, Frank?

17:51.945 --> 17:53.947
Actually, we don't plan
on having children.

17:54.031 --> 17:56.992
Wrong thing to say, Frank.
Mama's bucking for more grandkids.

17:57.076 --> 18:00.204
All right, not now, but maybe later on
you'll want your own family.

18:00.746 --> 18:03.540
Mama, I have a son,
and we both have careers.

18:03.624 --> 18:05.167
We're not thinking about a family.

18:05.751 --> 18:07.002
You have careers?

18:07.544 --> 18:09.755
What is a life
without children in the home?

18:11.048 --> 18:13.467
Joyce, you were married before.

18:13.550 --> 18:15.844
-You don't have children?
-No, I don't.

18:17.096 --> 18:20.933
Well, no matter what your feelings are,
yours and Frank's,

18:21.016 --> 18:24.478
I'll tell you that no marriage is blessed
unless there are children.

18:27.314 --> 18:30.859
Jesus Martinez, Sergeant.
Paralegal for Attorney Brown.

18:30.943 --> 18:33.403
What can I do for you, Mr. Martinez?

18:33.487 --> 18:35.697
I need to talk to one of
Attorney Brown's clients,

18:35.781 --> 18:39.743
-Germaine Burton?
-Interrogation room B, Mr. Martinez.

18:39.827 --> 18:42.496
Thank you, Sergeant. <i>Madre mía!</i>

18:44.081 --> 18:47.084
-What do you want?
-Detectives Larue and Washington around?

18:47.876 --> 18:48.877
Inside.

18:51.296 --> 18:52.381
Officer.

18:56.301 --> 18:58.887
-Where's Mr. Brown?
-Where's Mr. Green?

19:02.057 --> 19:03.058
That is down payment.

19:04.893 --> 19:07.646
I don't see where it says
"Made in Switzerland."

19:07.729 --> 19:08.856
Oh, here it is.

19:09.898 --> 19:12.359
That's from Mexico. Come on.

19:17.239 --> 19:18.782
That's an onyx.

19:20.909 --> 19:23.537
-That's jive.
-Oh, come on, man! What's the holdup?

19:23.620 --> 19:25.414
Come on, come on. Car keys.

19:31.837 --> 19:33.046
Where's it parked?

19:33.130 --> 19:34.548
112th, off Dekker.

19:38.760 --> 19:42.264
You live on 142nd.
You were busted on 129th.

19:43.098 --> 19:46.018
And you're sure it's 112th?
Now, don't lie.

19:50.063 --> 19:51.565
Who do you think you're talking to?

19:52.274 --> 19:53.525
Some little-girl P.D.?

19:53.609 --> 19:55.944
Because if it comes out
you're lying to me, Burton,

19:56.028 --> 19:59.156
you're gonna be wanting 90 days.

19:59.239 --> 20:00.699
You're gonna be asking the judge

20:00.782 --> 20:02.117
to give you more!

20:05.204 --> 20:06.663
Maybe it was, uh,

20:06.747 --> 20:08.332
130th, off Van Buren.

20:10.250 --> 20:12.085
Retainer gratefully accepted.

20:12.711 --> 20:14.379
Come on, man, that's a Bonneville!

20:14.463 --> 20:15.505
Beauty.

20:17.716 --> 20:20.260
Come up with two grand
so you can have your keys back.

20:21.011 --> 20:22.971
Now tell me, what went down?

20:24.181 --> 20:25.307
I got busted...

20:26.058 --> 20:27.100
by a turkey.

20:32.022 --> 20:33.065
Sid.

20:35.734 --> 20:37.444
You delivered.

20:37.527 --> 20:39.863
Hey, guys, meet Leonard.

20:39.947 --> 20:43.367
Solid. Detectives Larue and Washington.

20:43.450 --> 20:44.409
Hey, fellas.

20:44.493 --> 20:47.788
Len, I understand you had
quite a rep back in Baltimore.

20:47.871 --> 20:49.665
Tell him what you used to do.

20:49.748 --> 20:50.916
Got wasted.

20:50.999 --> 20:53.335
No, not that.
With the car at the speedway.

20:53.418 --> 20:55.420
Oh, you mean picking them up,
putting them down?

20:55.504 --> 20:57.547
(laughs)

20:57.631 --> 21:00.175
He used to be <i>Mr. Baltimore Speedway.</i>

21:00.259 --> 21:03.553
Uh, Len, you ever been in a tug-of-war?

21:03.637 --> 21:05.180
No, he knits a lot.

21:05.264 --> 21:07.766
The man's got advanced degrees in tugging.

21:08.684 --> 21:10.644
-I'm a little hungry, fellas.
-No problem.

21:10.727 --> 21:12.980
Celeste, phone our guest that pizza order.

21:13.063 --> 21:15.524
-We'll pick it up on the way back.
-We'll take care of you.

21:15.607 --> 21:17.943
Get what you want, now. Don't be shy.

21:18.026 --> 21:19.528
A couple of pizzas might do it.

21:19.611 --> 21:22.322
-Did I do good, fellas?
-You did beautiful.

21:22.406 --> 21:24.658
So, is this the part where
I get tidied up?

21:24.741 --> 21:26.034
We combined your finder's fee

21:26.118 --> 21:28.078
with a Christmas present for you, Sid.

21:28.161 --> 21:30.706
Yeah, we figured it being Christmas,
cash was a little lame.

21:30.789 --> 21:33.709
Hey, I gotta tell you something,
I'm no sentimentalist.

21:33.792 --> 21:35.919
Well, we decided to get you
a present instead.

21:36.545 --> 21:39.256
-Fellas, I mean--
<i>-Voilá.</i>

21:41.967 --> 21:43.010
Well, it ain't ticking.

21:45.971 --> 21:49.474
My paper? My 416?

21:50.058 --> 21:52.477
My $3,600 winning ticket?

21:52.561 --> 21:54.646
How'd you guys get this out of evidence?

21:54.730 --> 21:56.982
You found that Sid, you understand?

21:57.065 --> 21:59.151
<i>Capisce.</i> Sure.

21:59.234 --> 22:02.362
Hey, Merry Christmas, my man.

22:02.446 --> 22:03.530
You guys put me away,

22:03.613 --> 22:05.824
and then you go
and do something like this.

22:05.907 --> 22:07.659
Don't let anybody ever put down America

22:07.743 --> 22:09.786
in front of Sidney Thurston, all right?

22:10.537 --> 22:13.832
I won't have anybody ever <i>knock</i>
law enforcement.

22:13.915 --> 22:16.585
HUNTER: All right,
let's think of ourselves as one,

22:16.668 --> 22:18.503
single competitive being!

22:18.587 --> 22:21.798
-Let's show them some esprit!
-(indistinct chattering)

22:21.882 --> 22:24.843
Detective Larue?
The Benefit Olympics await.

22:24.926 --> 22:27.262
-Gotta go, Sid.
-Drop the case with me later.

22:27.346 --> 22:28.638
Okay.

22:28.722 --> 22:29.931
(sighs, exhales)

22:31.141 --> 22:33.477
-Come on, let's go!
-You're driving, right?

22:33.560 --> 22:34.770
(indistinct chattering)

22:34.853 --> 22:37.189
Oh, wait till Renko sees him.

22:40.817 --> 22:42.027
You got a minute for me?

22:42.110 --> 22:43.236
Sure.

22:45.489 --> 22:47.115
I haven't seen the case report yet.

22:47.199 --> 22:49.493
Was Hill and Renko's collar
the call you went out on?

22:49.576 --> 22:51.203
-Right.
-Why'd you take that?

22:51.286 --> 22:54.164
Shouldn't that have been
a uniform call from the beginning?

22:54.247 --> 22:56.458
Picked up the phone.
I didn't have nothing else to do.

22:56.541 --> 22:58.668
I don't want this to be a beef between us,

22:58.752 --> 23:00.837
but I do want to talk about the procedure.

23:00.921 --> 23:03.131
-Yo, Lieutenant.
-I'm busy now, Jesus.

23:03.215 --> 23:04.925
It's about your man here.

23:05.008 --> 23:07.010
He busted one of Attorney Brown's clients,

23:07.094 --> 23:09.805
a Germaine Burton,
with a dope-sniffing turkey.

23:09.888 --> 23:12.265
Yeah, and your man turned out
to be holding plenty.

23:12.349 --> 23:15.435
The thing is, I drop a dime
at the zoo, Henry.

23:15.519 --> 23:18.355
Turkeys and chicken happen to be, uh...

23:18.438 --> 23:19.648
(clears throat)

23:19.731 --> 23:24.653
…galliforms, which means they got
a poorly-developed olfactory sense.

23:24.736 --> 23:28.990
Dude can't smell squat.
Therefore, no probable cause.

23:29.074 --> 23:32.077
Well, I'd be quite surprised
if the turkey was grounds

23:32.160 --> 23:35.038
-for Lieutenant Buntz' arrest.
-The grounds was your guy ran away

23:35.122 --> 23:37.082
when I stopped him
for questioning, alright?

23:37.165 --> 23:38.708
No sale, Lieutenant.

23:38.792 --> 23:41.294
My client says it was represented to him

23:41.378 --> 23:45.382
he already had probable cause
behind a dope-sniffing turkey.

23:46.299 --> 23:49.636
Your client, Jesus?
I didn't know you passed the bar.

23:49.719 --> 23:53.807
Don't need no law degree
to smell a (indistinct phrase), Henry.

23:53.890 --> 23:55.851
When Attorney Brown gets here,

23:55.934 --> 23:58.854
your man's gonna be eating the dark meat.

23:58.937 --> 24:01.189
Hey, you're the bright boy
from the gangs, aren't you?

24:01.273 --> 24:03.650
-I heard about you.
-Give us a second, Jesus.

24:03.733 --> 24:05.902
Yeah. I'll give you more than that.

24:11.074 --> 24:12.117
So?

24:14.411 --> 24:15.704
We read the same policy memos?

24:15.787 --> 24:18.540
Yeah, no subterfuge
to establish probable cause.

24:18.623 --> 24:20.876
That case law clarifies... Stan?

24:20.959 --> 24:23.920
Would your release a perp named Burton?
No probable cause.

24:24.004 --> 24:25.380
-Alright.
-That's great.

24:25.464 --> 24:28.633
You want me to apologize to the guy, too?
You want me to give him his dope back?

24:28.717 --> 24:29.718
Come on, Norm.

24:31.845 --> 24:34.848
On behalf of these clients
of Attorney Harold Brown,

24:34.931 --> 24:38.310
I would like to buy half a roll of tickets
for the Christmas Olympics.

24:38.393 --> 24:42.105
-Your turkey client's getting the boot.
-Ah. Make that $10 more.

24:43.482 --> 24:44.483
All right, move on.

24:44.566 --> 24:46.902
And don't let the door hit you
in the butt on the way out.

24:46.985 --> 24:51.531
Don't take it personal, Lieutenant.
It's the nature of the adversarial system.

24:51.615 --> 24:54.367
(grunts) Now,
you watch your lip, bright boy!

24:54.451 --> 24:56.369
You show your ugly face
around here anymore,

24:56.453 --> 24:57.871
I'm gonna rip it off!

24:57.954 --> 24:59.039
Take it easy, man.

24:59.122 --> 25:01.458
You're costing me some dry cleaning here.

25:01.541 --> 25:03.210
-(clears throat)
-Attorney Brown.

25:03.293 --> 25:05.128
Officer, you let my paralegal go now.

25:05.212 --> 25:06.963
(laughs)

25:07.047 --> 25:08.840
I told you you got nothing on me.

25:08.924 --> 25:12.135
I'm right back on the street
doing my same old same old.

25:12.219 --> 25:13.470
Been real fun, Lieutenant.

25:14.429 --> 25:17.224
Lieutenant, I'm filing a legal
complaint for harassment.

25:17.307 --> 25:19.476
Oh, jeez, I'm in a panic, you know.

25:20.268 --> 25:22.312
It's Christmas. Everybody's a little hot.

25:22.395 --> 25:24.523
Let's all try to cool down here.
You okay, Jesus?

25:24.606 --> 25:26.358
Yeah, I'll live.

25:27.192 --> 25:29.486
-Norm?
-Yeah, yeah.

25:29.569 --> 25:31.738
I can't breathe in this freaking place.

25:31.821 --> 25:34.241
I'm suffocating in this freaking place.

25:35.075 --> 25:38.286
("Angels We Have Heard On High" plays)

25:43.291 --> 25:45.168
-Hi.
-Hi.

25:45.252 --> 25:46.336
Merry Christmas.

25:46.419 --> 25:48.296
Merry Christmas.

25:48.380 --> 25:49.923
Small world, isn't it?

25:50.006 --> 25:51.925
I missed you the last few classes.

25:52.008 --> 25:53.009
You did?

25:53.093 --> 25:54.761
You, uh, lose interest?

25:55.345 --> 25:56.429
No, not really.

25:56.513 --> 25:57.472
Why'd you stop?

25:57.556 --> 26:00.934
Oh, I don't know.
I was feeling kind of weird.

26:01.017 --> 26:02.352
About ceramics?

26:02.435 --> 26:05.230
Uh, I was feeling kind of weird about you.

26:07.274 --> 26:10.235
So, it wasn't just one way.

26:10.860 --> 26:11.987
What's that mean?

26:12.821 --> 26:14.489
It wasn't just me having a crush on you.

26:18.118 --> 26:21.246
Listen, would you like to have
a cup of coffee or anything?

26:21.329 --> 26:24.249
I'd... like to talk to you
for a few minutes.

26:26.376 --> 26:27.752
Finished up your shopping?

26:29.629 --> 26:31.756
My wife and I separated three days ago.

26:32.966 --> 26:34.759
-No kidding?
-No kidding.

26:35.302 --> 26:39.389
I'm supposed to say, "I'm sorry," but--

26:39.472 --> 26:41.016
Yeah, I am, too.

26:41.725 --> 26:44.728
If I was talking with anybody else,
if I was talking with anyone but you,

26:44.811 --> 26:46.896
I'd say how we were trying
to get it back together.

26:46.980 --> 26:48.273
We hope it'll still work out.

26:49.482 --> 26:51.484
And if you were talking with me, then?

26:54.195 --> 26:56.156
Then I'd say I'd like to do all the things

26:56.239 --> 26:58.491
that I thought of us doing
together right now

26:59.492 --> 27:01.870
and that I guess you might have
thought about doing, too.

27:08.418 --> 27:10.670
(laughs)

27:10.754 --> 27:12.005
What's so funny?

27:12.088 --> 27:14.299
Well, you know, my bedroom...

27:15.675 --> 27:18.803
I've been saying for three years
that I was gonna start painting it, right?

27:18.887 --> 27:21.222
So, when do I start? Last night.

27:21.306 --> 27:24.059
And it's great timing, isn't it?

27:24.643 --> 27:26.061
It's not a problem.

27:27.187 --> 27:30.106
Um. Oh, thank you.
Let me get you a beer or something.

27:30.190 --> 27:32.442
-Would you like a beer?
-Oh, uh, I don't know.

27:32.525 --> 27:34.152
Let me think about it for a minute.

27:35.278 --> 27:37.322
-Oh, holy cow.
-What?

27:38.615 --> 27:42.202
I am nervous, and I guess
that's a good sign, huh?

27:42.285 --> 27:43.620
Why's that?

27:44.329 --> 27:47.916
Well, because if we're gonna
be casual about this,

27:47.999 --> 27:50.752
I mean, we probably shouldn't
even be here at all.

27:50.835 --> 27:52.212
At that store, I was...

27:53.213 --> 27:55.423
close to getting arrested
for public lewdness.

27:58.551 --> 28:00.679
-I wanted to jump you right there.
-You did?

28:00.762 --> 28:03.765
-Mmm.
-I was feeling a little warm myself...

28:04.641 --> 28:06.059
a little <i>caliente.</i>

28:08.812 --> 28:10.438
You know, we don't <i>have</i> to do this.

28:11.898 --> 28:12.899
I know.

28:14.025 --> 28:16.820
I mean, being separated only three days...

28:17.612 --> 28:19.197
maybe it's...

28:21.700 --> 28:22.784
Do you want to?

28:23.493 --> 28:24.536
Uh-huh.

28:26.204 --> 28:27.288
You?

28:28.581 --> 28:29.582
Uh-huh.

28:30.250 --> 28:31.459
A lot.

28:33.128 --> 28:34.713
Sophie's mom's been living with us

28:34.796 --> 28:37.132
ever since the old man died.
Drives Sophie crazy.

28:37.215 --> 28:38.925
Maybe you want to take her home with you.

28:40.343 --> 28:42.554
-What's with Pop?
-Some things never change.

28:42.637 --> 28:44.723
When I call, he won't even
get on the phone.

28:44.806 --> 28:47.684
Frank, he doesn't know what to say.

28:47.767 --> 28:50.603
Your divorce, it was like something
from outer space for him.

28:51.438 --> 28:53.565
They don't even mention
it to their friends.

28:53.648 --> 28:55.525
BARBARA: She may be
a perfectly nice person,

28:55.608 --> 28:58.611
but I don't feel it's a natural union.

28:58.695 --> 28:59.863
Mama, she's his wife.

28:59.946 --> 29:02.157
In the eyes of the Church,
Fay is still his wife.

29:02.240 --> 29:04.743
I know my son. He would want children.

29:04.826 --> 29:06.870
-Mama--
-All this talk about careers.

29:06.953 --> 29:08.913
-That's not for Frank.
-<i>Mama.</i>

29:08.997 --> 29:10.039
What?

29:10.123 --> 29:12.083
Sophie's trying to tell you
I heard what you said.

29:14.169 --> 29:16.337
Oh, sure. You were listening to us.

29:16.421 --> 29:18.173
-Small house, it's hard not to--
-Small!

29:18.256 --> 29:20.049
SOPHIE: She didn't mean it
the way it sounded.

29:20.133 --> 29:22.802
-Oh, please.
-Mama...

29:22.886 --> 29:25.805
What I said, I'd say to her face.

29:25.889 --> 29:27.140
Uh, career woman?

29:27.223 --> 29:29.893
That's enough, Mama. Joyce is my wife.

29:29.976 --> 29:31.644
Either you accept her or we're leaving.

29:31.728 --> 29:35.398
I can't help what I feel. It's wrong!

29:35.482 --> 29:37.901
-Yes or no, Mama?
-Now he attacks me, eh?

29:37.984 --> 29:39.861
Mama, please! You're way out of line!

29:39.944 --> 29:41.613
-Joe, don't talk--
-Sophie, please!

29:41.696 --> 29:43.323
-I'll go find Joyce.
-Frank!

29:43.406 --> 29:45.366
Frank, don't leave!

29:45.450 --> 29:46.701
-Frank, please!
-Mama, Mama.

29:46.785 --> 29:49.037
I don't want you to be
a stranger to my house.

29:49.120 --> 29:50.038
Please!

29:54.501 --> 29:55.543
Joyce.

29:56.127 --> 29:58.087
Can we just get in the car and go home?

29:58.171 --> 29:59.881
I'm sorry.

30:01.049 --> 30:03.176
I really didn't think
it would come to this.

30:03.259 --> 30:04.511
You didn't? Really?

30:05.053 --> 30:06.471
If you want to leave, we'll leave.

30:06.554 --> 30:08.723
But you'd like me to give her
another chance, right?

30:08.807 --> 30:09.766
Is that it?

30:11.518 --> 30:13.770
Frank, I never should have come.

30:14.437 --> 30:15.772
She'll never accept me.

30:18.691 --> 30:19.984
Joyce, listen to me.

30:20.777 --> 30:23.488
I've talked about this woman for years.
She flies off the handle.

30:23.571 --> 30:25.365
She doesn't mean 10% of what she says.

30:25.448 --> 30:27.534
I disagree. I think she does.

30:28.743 --> 30:30.912
Though maybe it's not entirely her fault.

30:31.996 --> 30:34.582
Have you ever told her why
your first marriage failed?

30:34.666 --> 30:36.918
-I mean, the real reason?
-No, I haven't.

30:37.001 --> 30:39.796
(voice breaking)
Well, you can't duck things

30:39.879 --> 30:43.091
for six years, Frank,
and expect them to go away.

30:44.175 --> 30:45.677
-You see how--
-Did you tell her...

30:46.261 --> 30:47.929
(snuffles) that I can't have children?

30:48.012 --> 30:49.138
You see how she is.

30:49.222 --> 30:51.307
I haven't discussed
any of those things with her.

30:53.184 --> 30:55.645
You mean she uses hysterics
to make you feel guilty,

30:55.728 --> 30:56.813
so you say nothing.

30:56.896 --> 30:58.189
Don't psychoanalyze her.

30:58.273 --> 31:00.233
You watch, she'll come out
and talk to you now.

31:00.316 --> 31:03.319
-(sarcastically) Wonderful. I can't wait.
-(laughs)

31:14.038 --> 31:15.665
Just your basic family visit.

31:16.291 --> 31:18.001
(laughing)

31:27.385 --> 31:29.470
That was wonderful.

31:29.554 --> 31:30.722
Amen.

31:32.599 --> 31:35.184
You know, I'm glad we did it.

31:36.060 --> 31:37.353
Me too.

31:37.437 --> 31:39.814
I mean, there's no obligation at all

31:39.898 --> 31:40.815
to either one of us.

31:40.899 --> 31:42.233
I understand.

31:43.610 --> 31:45.612
You know what I want? Can I tell you?

31:45.695 --> 31:46.821
Of course.

31:47.697 --> 31:50.700
I want for us to be <i>close.</i>

31:52.619 --> 31:54.412
Yeah, well, we are.

31:54.495 --> 31:55.955
Couldn't have gotten much closer.

31:57.206 --> 31:59.292
We didn't screw ourselves up,
did we, by doing it?

31:59.375 --> 32:00.543
Oh, no, no.

32:01.419 --> 32:02.545
No way.

32:08.051 --> 32:09.302
I ought to go.

32:15.141 --> 32:17.018
They don't remember how it really was.

32:17.101 --> 32:20.271
They don't even remember
how they worried about Frank.

32:20.897 --> 32:22.899
Did you know Frank
when he was married to Fay?

32:22.982 --> 32:24.901
I met him just after their divorce.

32:25.568 --> 32:26.903
He was in bad shape then.

32:30.156 --> 32:32.325
-Does he drink anymore?
-Not at all.

32:35.662 --> 32:37.038
You've done a lot for him,

32:37.705 --> 32:38.915
and it shows.

32:41.334 --> 32:43.378
(laughs) You know, Frank and I,

32:43.461 --> 32:45.880
we've always liked different things,

32:47.298 --> 32:49.550
like Country Mouse, City Mouse, you know?

32:52.804 --> 32:54.263
I really love that guy.

32:56.099 --> 32:57.141
I miss seeing him a lot.

32:57.892 --> 32:59.310
You should come and see us, Joe.

33:00.144 --> 33:02.438
You really want a bunch of
country mice up there?

33:02.522 --> 33:03.731
We'd like it very much.

33:06.442 --> 33:08.528
(cheering)

33:23.001 --> 33:25.461
ANNOUNCER:
<i>A sterling effort by Frank Smith.</i>

33:25.545 --> 33:27.171
Heard your groin muscle popped.

33:27.255 --> 33:29.007
Horrible pain when they go.

33:29.090 --> 33:30.967
And if the intestine gets strangulated,

33:31.050 --> 33:33.970
hey, it can be a matter of minutes.

33:34.053 --> 33:36.806
You have to capture this one, Joseph.

33:36.889 --> 33:39.434
Think of Atlas. Recall the warrior kings.

33:39.517 --> 33:41.853
-I got you, Lieutenant, all right?
-Ready?

33:42.520 --> 33:44.188
Contestants, ready?

33:45.231 --> 33:46.983
-(gunshot)
-ANNOUNCER: <i>And they're off!</i>

33:47.066 --> 33:48.568
(cheering)

33:48.651 --> 33:50.028
<i>It's dead even at this point.</i>

33:50.111 --> 33:52.321
<i>Wait, Officer Renko in lane three</i>
<i>is taking the lead.</i>

33:52.405 --> 33:54.699
<i>He's pushing ahead by two</i>
<i>lengths, looking strong.</i>

33:55.616 --> 33:58.161
-Oh! Whoa!
-ANNOUNCER: <i>Wait! Hold it!</i>

33:58.244 --> 33:59.495
<i>Oh, no. He's hurting.</i>

33:59.579 --> 34:01.247
HILL: Renko, get up!

34:01.330 --> 34:04.125
ANNOUNCER: <i>He's down!</i>
(continues, indistinct)

34:04.208 --> 34:06.294
<i>Now firefighters taking the lead away.</i>

34:06.377 --> 34:07.962
<i>Here comes Officer Joe Coffey.</i>

34:08.046 --> 34:11.340
<i>He starts, he stalls,</i>
<i>and he wins it by a nose.</i>

34:11.424 --> 34:13.259
<i>A remarkable victory...</i>

34:13.342 --> 34:14.886
Don't hit my back, please.

34:18.931 --> 34:21.642
Apparently, Martinez agreed
to withdraw the complaint.

34:21.726 --> 34:24.520
Yeah? Well, hip hip freaking hooray.

34:27.398 --> 34:30.068
Guess this is what they
mean by a skeleton crew.

34:30.151 --> 34:32.195
Jeez, I always wondered about that.

34:33.071 --> 34:36.532
-I don't want to be enemies.
-Look, I got a style. You understand?

34:36.616 --> 34:39.285
I get cut off from my instincts,
I'm taking a shortcut to dead.

34:39.368 --> 34:40.578
I wish I had your instincts,

34:40.661 --> 34:43.372
but you can't turn them
into the law, Norm.

34:43.456 --> 34:44.540
You know that.

34:46.584 --> 34:49.504
At least I got the creep off
the streets for a while, huh?

34:49.587 --> 34:52.298
-That's another conversation.
-Favor, one of you.

34:52.381 --> 34:53.299
Yeah, sure.

34:53.382 --> 34:56.177
I was such a sport letting
people go to those Olympics.

34:56.260 --> 34:58.763
One of you do a street call for me
on your way home?

34:59.430 --> 35:01.307
Jeez, I don't know, Sarge.

35:01.390 --> 35:03.893
Shouldn't that be one of
the uniforms dispatch?

35:03.976 --> 35:06.187
I know that. I told you, I'm short-handed.

35:06.270 --> 35:09.440
He's busting my stones, Stan.
I'll take the call.

35:09.524 --> 35:11.651
-No, I'll take it.
-It's a repeat domestic.

35:11.734 --> 35:14.362
To be technical, it ought to be two cops.

35:14.445 --> 35:16.906
Come on. I'll show you some <i>instinct.</i>

35:17.490 --> 35:18.783
See you later, Stan.

35:20.993 --> 35:22.620
Last man at the Alamo.

35:23.454 --> 35:26.290
When I first defended him,
he was the Cisco Kid,

35:26.374 --> 35:29.544
-complete with pearl-handled pistol.
-Cap pistols.

35:29.627 --> 35:32.004
Then I represented him as Cochise.

35:32.088 --> 35:33.589
-The Indian?
-Mm-mm.

35:33.673 --> 35:35.299
You know about Cochise?

35:35.383 --> 35:38.219
You don't know what I know.
Did he have arrows?

35:38.302 --> 35:41.180
Ah. War paint, bare-chested, feathers.

35:41.264 --> 35:44.142
(chuckles) Crazy. The world's gone crazy.

35:44.225 --> 35:47.937
Well, I think that to do the work you do,
you must be very smart and very brave.

35:49.272 --> 35:50.398
She is.

35:55.153 --> 35:56.154
Pop?

36:02.743 --> 36:04.620
I want you to meet my wife, Joyce.

36:04.704 --> 36:05.872
Mr. Furillo.

36:06.664 --> 36:07.790
Nice to meet you.

36:09.375 --> 36:10.501
-Hi, Tommy.
-Hi, Grandpa.

36:10.585 --> 36:12.628
(laughs) Here's my girl!

36:12.712 --> 36:15.798
Oh, say, that's a pretty red dress
you've got on.

36:16.924 --> 36:21.012
ANNOUNCER: <i>After six events,</i>
<i>the score stands even at 3-3.</i>

36:21.095 --> 36:23.723
<i>The deciding event will be the tug-of-war.</i>

36:23.806 --> 36:26.517
<i>Will the contestants for this event</i>
<i>please take your positions?</i>

36:26.601 --> 36:28.144
-How you doing, Len?
-Pretty good.

36:28.227 --> 36:29.520
What do you mean, pretty good?

36:29.604 --> 36:31.814
That's an ex-middle linebacker back there.

36:31.898 --> 36:33.649
These guys imported the genuine article.

36:33.733 --> 36:35.359
Look, the dot part is better.

36:35.443 --> 36:37.445
Dots? The dot part?

36:37.528 --> 36:39.197
I had a shrimp pizza.

36:39.280 --> 36:42.491
Sometimes I get
a bad reaction from shellfish.

36:42.575 --> 36:46.245
-But... things are pretty good.
-(whistle blows)

36:48.206 --> 36:51.167
Now, we're gonna have to suck it up
if we're gonna break this tie.

36:51.250 --> 36:52.793
We have to hone ourselves

36:52.877 --> 36:56.839
into an oriental-like concentration
to the task at hand.

36:56.923 --> 36:58.841
We are no longer individuals.

36:58.925 --> 37:02.303
We belong to that great chain of being.

37:03.054 --> 37:05.556
We are the rope.
Put your hands right here.

37:05.640 --> 37:08.726
We are the rope. The rope is light.

37:09.268 --> 37:13.314
ALL: We are the rope! The rope is light!

37:15.358 --> 37:18.986
ANNOUNCER: <i>Okay, everyone plant those feet</i>
<i>and get a firm grasp on the rope.</i>

37:19.070 --> 37:21.572
-(grunts)
<i>-This one is it. This is the big one.</i>

37:21.656 --> 37:24.533
<i>One of these teams is going</i>
<i>home with a trophy</i>

37:24.617 --> 37:26.410
<i>and one with one hell of a cleaning bill.</i>

37:26.494 --> 37:28.287
-MAN: The rope is light.
-(whistle blows)

37:28.371 --> 37:30.081
ANNOUNCER: <i>Okay, let's get it in.</i>

37:30.164 --> 37:31.666
<i>-They're pulling.</i>
-(grunting)

37:31.749 --> 37:33.626
-(cheering)
- Dig in!

37:33.709 --> 37:35.127
HUNTER: Pull!

37:35.211 --> 37:36.754
ANNOUNCER: <i>No. No, wait.</i>

37:36.837 --> 37:39.215
-I'm seeing dots.
-Ignore 'em!

37:40.299 --> 37:42.260
MAN: Come on! Come on!

37:42.969 --> 37:44.720
ANNOUNCER: <i>Firemen seem to be weakening.</i>

37:44.804 --> 37:45.930
<i>There's no doubt about it.</i>

37:46.013 --> 37:47.765
<i>The Hill Street cops are coming on strong.</i>

37:47.848 --> 37:49.558
(men grunting)

37:49.642 --> 37:51.519
Come on!

37:52.395 --> 37:53.688
ANNOUNCER: <i>There they go!</i>

37:53.771 --> 37:55.356
Pull!

37:55.439 --> 37:56.899
(crowd cheering)

37:56.983 --> 37:59.527
-Yes!
-ANNOUNCER: <i>Let's hear it for them!</i>

37:59.610 --> 38:00.861
(cheering)

38:00.945 --> 38:04.824
Oh, the stack-a-rama!

38:04.907 --> 38:06.617
Every man for himself!

38:06.701 --> 38:09.078
-Come on! What are you doing?
-(grunts)

38:09.161 --> 38:12.790
ANNOUNCER: <i>The big guy's out of control.</i>
<i>Somebody stop that guy.</i>

38:15.042 --> 38:16.335
<i>And another one.</i>

38:17.003 --> 38:18.504
(screaming)

38:18.587 --> 38:22.133
-(whistle blows)
-Yeah! (groans)

38:22.216 --> 38:23.718
(laughter)

38:23.801 --> 38:24.969
No house yet, Frank?

38:25.052 --> 38:26.762
Still an apartment.

38:27.930 --> 38:31.225
-Joe's got a really nice place.
-Frank, you've seen it.

38:32.018 --> 38:34.395
We've redone the inside,
and we've added a deck.

38:34.478 --> 38:35.688
Sounds terrific.

38:35.771 --> 38:38.024
I read the papers about your commission.

38:38.107 --> 38:40.735
You could be the next chief of police.

38:41.485 --> 38:43.154
I'm not counting on it.

38:43.237 --> 38:44.905
He's too modest, Pop.

38:44.989 --> 38:48.075
The TV news, the TV news!
says that he should have the job.

38:48.159 --> 38:51.370
Frank, have you seen Joe's
new office building yet?

38:52.413 --> 38:53.748
He was telling me about it.

38:53.831 --> 38:55.666
Oh, you ought to see it.

38:55.750 --> 38:57.877
Oh, it's really something to be proud of.

39:00.004 --> 39:01.505
Sophie's so good with them.

39:05.009 --> 39:06.510
Do you like children?

39:06.594 --> 39:07.887
Very much.

39:08.679 --> 39:11.474
Mrs. Furillo,
I'm not able to have children.

39:11.557 --> 39:13.434
Frank and I have talked about adopting.

39:13.517 --> 39:15.394
We've talked about all kinds of things.

39:15.936 --> 39:18.647
But the reality is we can't have a family
the way we'd like to.

39:21.901 --> 39:23.819
The things I said, what I did.

39:24.904 --> 39:26.113
I feel so foolish.

39:30.284 --> 39:32.411
All I want for Frank is that he be happy.

39:33.454 --> 39:34.497
So do I.

39:40.878 --> 39:42.922
This old kitchen.

39:43.005 --> 39:45.257
Next time you come, Frank, all new...

39:45.341 --> 39:47.134
dishwasher, microwave oven,

39:47.218 --> 39:50.846
what they call a touch-top stove.

39:50.930 --> 39:51.931
All new.

39:53.307 --> 39:55.810
-Just decided?
-That's right.

39:56.435 --> 39:58.687
Your father wanted to do it years ago,
but I, uh,

39:59.438 --> 40:02.358
I've hung on to
a lot of silly old opinions.

40:02.441 --> 40:03.401
But no more, Frank.

40:03.484 --> 40:05.403
No more silly old opinions.

40:06.612 --> 40:07.863
I mean it this time.

40:09.407 --> 40:10.574
I'm glad, Mama.

40:11.826 --> 40:15.996
Yep. You get old and stupid
ideas get fixed in your head

40:16.080 --> 40:18.833
like a curtain that hangs in front of
what you really feel.

40:20.459 --> 40:21.836
No more, Frank.

40:22.586 --> 40:24.380
Next time you come, all new.

40:24.463 --> 40:25.631
I promise.

40:27.383 --> 40:30.803
(man shouting in Spanish)

40:30.886 --> 40:32.930
(sobbing)

40:33.013 --> 40:35.349
Please don't let him jump!

40:35.433 --> 40:36.642
What's going on?

40:36.725 --> 40:38.310
He climbed out.

40:38.394 --> 40:40.771
The landlord said
if he didn't get a job by 5:00,

40:40.855 --> 40:42.898
-we have to move.
-Time's up.

40:42.982 --> 40:44.608
Hey, policeman!

40:45.276 --> 40:47.445
He wants to throw me out at 5:00.

40:47.528 --> 40:49.447
I'm not moving from here.

40:49.530 --> 40:52.450
Look at this idiot. I should let him jump.

40:52.533 --> 40:54.452
You should have pity!

40:54.535 --> 40:55.744
Have pity, huh?

40:55.828 --> 40:58.080
That's what I'm doing,
gonna offer him the super's job

40:58.164 --> 41:00.291
at my other building, 423.

41:00.374 --> 41:02.293
My manager got stabbed.

41:02.376 --> 41:04.545
They tell you to own property. Ha!

41:06.839 --> 41:08.883
(sighs)

41:08.966 --> 41:10.801
-Be careful, Junior.
-He's all right.

41:10.885 --> 41:12.928
Mr. Pinzon,
I think this is a fair arrangement

41:13.012 --> 41:14.638
Mr. Garcia's making.

41:14.722 --> 41:16.932
Look, I'm good with my hands.
He knows that.

41:17.016 --> 41:18.350
I fix his stoop before.

41:18.434 --> 41:20.478
You should look for work, plus this, too.

41:20.561 --> 41:21.854
And what about the back rent?

41:21.937 --> 41:24.023
-I'm gonna try.
-Hey, Lieutenant, case closed.

41:24.106 --> 41:26.859
-Let's not have our birthdays here.
-I'm just sketching this out.

41:26.942 --> 41:28.527
It's kind of a budget you can aim for.

41:28.611 --> 41:29.612
Thank you.

41:34.408 --> 41:37.077
You see? My luck does change.

41:37.161 --> 41:41.373
Hey, pal, you know,
I used to ask my priest,

41:41.457 --> 41:44.084
we'd cross ourselves
before the big game, I'd say,

41:44.168 --> 41:46.587
"Father, is that gonna make us win?"

41:46.670 --> 41:49.423
And he'd say,
"It will if you block your man."

41:49.507 --> 41:51.258
You understand what I'm saying here?

41:51.342 --> 41:53.886
You got to help yourself.
You got to hold up your end.

41:53.969 --> 41:56.430
Otherwise, that's gonna be
Our Lady of Eviction.

41:56.514 --> 41:58.307
That's right. Good for you.

41:59.099 --> 42:00.059
I understand.

42:00.935 --> 42:04.480
Of course, I don't understand
how you expect to turn a buck,

42:04.563 --> 42:06.982
being how you're keeping
this thing a state secret.

42:07.066 --> 42:08.067
What do you mean?

42:08.692 --> 42:12.154
(clears throat) You ever hear
of advertising, hmm?

42:12.238 --> 42:13.739
Get a little word of mouth going.

42:13.822 --> 42:16.867
Let the people know
the freaking thing is up here.

42:21.330 --> 42:23.290
Hey, Merry Christmas, kid.

42:24.875 --> 42:26.460
I hope you get a full one.

42:33.551 --> 42:36.053
It made sense, what you said to him.

42:36.136 --> 42:37.555
Guy's a jerk.

42:37.638 --> 42:39.640
He's sitting on top of a nice buck.

42:39.723 --> 42:41.058
Here, look at this.

42:41.141 --> 42:42.851
Uh, religious vision!

42:42.935 --> 42:47.147
There's a religious vision upstairs,
the fourth floor, apartment 407.

42:47.231 --> 42:49.233
Contributions voluntary.

42:49.316 --> 42:52.611
Religious vision,
go on up and see the holy vision.

42:52.695 --> 42:54.738
Upstairs, a holy vision!

42:54.822 --> 42:56.991
Right upstairs here, ma'am.
Go see the holy vision.

42:57.074 --> 42:59.118
Check it out, huh?

42:59.201 --> 43:01.078
Okay, I'll see you later. Merry Christmas.

43:01.161 --> 43:02.746
Holy vision upstairs!

43:02.830 --> 43:06.750
(melodramatic music playing)

43:06.834 --> 43:08.961
(telephone keys beeping)

43:12.214 --> 43:14.425
(telephone ringing)

43:20.139 --> 43:21.140
MAN: <i>Hello?</i>

43:25.102 --> 43:26.228
<i>Hello?</i>

43:27.563 --> 43:28.772
<i>Anybody there?</i>

43:36.238 --> 43:37.990
(dial tone)

43:52.379 --> 43:54.298
The doc said everything's okay.

43:54.381 --> 43:56.967
The doc said I could go out. I'm fine.

43:57.051 --> 43:59.136
(laughs)

44:07.186 --> 44:10.272
Robin, can we please get married?

44:10.356 --> 44:12.191
What do you mean?
I thought we settled that.

44:12.274 --> 44:13.942
I know we're getting married, I mean,

44:14.026 --> 44:15.694
can we get married right away?

44:16.945 --> 44:18.197
I just want all of us to know

44:18.280 --> 44:20.741
that we're in this together
and that we love each other.

44:21.450 --> 44:23.160
And I want the baby to know that, too.

44:24.578 --> 44:26.080
That's the sweetest thing.

44:26.163 --> 44:27.790
I was so afraid we were gonna lose it.

44:28.832 --> 44:30.709
We're not. It's not gonna happen.

44:31.460 --> 44:33.420
So, can we get married?

44:34.421 --> 44:36.048
-When?
-Tonight.

44:37.633 --> 44:40.010
-You don't want friends and stuff?
-No.

44:40.678 --> 44:42.805
-We're only gonna do this once.
-(sighs)

44:43.639 --> 44:45.057
All right, how about in two weeks?

44:46.433 --> 44:48.686
-Two weeks from today?
-I'm available.

44:48.769 --> 44:50.479
That's it. That's final.

44:54.400 --> 44:55.734
Tonight we decorate the trees.

44:56.443 --> 44:57.611
(chuckles)

45:01.532 --> 45:02.533
Pop?

45:04.576 --> 45:07.996
There's some kind of a bird in this wood.

45:09.331 --> 45:14.586
Maybe a Widgeon, Goldeneye,
maybe even a little Cinnamon-Wing Teal.

45:14.670 --> 45:17.548
It's important to know because
you got to commit to it.

45:19.049 --> 45:20.801
You make a mistake at the first,

45:21.635 --> 45:23.721
there's no way to ever make it right.

45:25.180 --> 45:26.432
We're getting ready to leave.

45:27.808 --> 45:30.185
Glad you came. Your mother misses you.

45:31.770 --> 45:34.022
Joe wants to bring Mom over to visit us.

45:34.106 --> 45:36.191
I'd like it very much if you came along.

45:36.275 --> 45:39.319
Oh, no. Now, you show her a good time.

45:39.403 --> 45:41.447
I wouldn't know what to do
up in the big city.

45:44.450 --> 45:46.744
Well, I guess I'll see you next time.

45:46.827 --> 45:50.164
When you see Fay and the boy,
give them our love.

45:53.208 --> 45:54.793
Joyce, you want to take this?

45:54.877 --> 45:56.003
Sure.

45:56.712 --> 45:58.756
Mama, thank you. (kisses)

45:58.839 --> 45:59.882
I love you.

46:00.841 --> 46:02.551
-You too.
-Merry Christmas.

46:02.634 --> 46:04.470
Merry Christmas. Thanks for everything.

46:04.553 --> 46:06.513
Frank, don't be a stranger, huh?

46:06.597 --> 46:07.765
I won't be. I promise.

46:07.848 --> 46:10.267
-And bring the kid. I'd like to see him.
-I will.

46:11.435 --> 46:12.895
It was good to come home.

46:12.978 --> 46:14.271
Don't worry about the old man.

46:14.354 --> 46:16.815
He's rough, but I'll work on him.
He'll come around.

46:18.567 --> 46:20.944
Frank, she's a great gal.

46:21.028 --> 46:22.154
She really is.

46:22.237 --> 46:26.867
(indistinct conversations)

46:26.950 --> 46:29.536
Don't leave now. Stay for the weekend.

46:29.620 --> 46:31.079
There's lots of room at our place.

46:31.163 --> 46:32.623
Oh, thank you,

46:32.706 --> 46:35.292
but we've already paid for
the cabin up at the lake.

46:35.375 --> 46:38.212
-We'll come back soon, okay?
-Okay. All right.

46:44.051 --> 46:45.052
What?

46:46.887 --> 46:48.347
Just be a minute.

46:50.224 --> 46:54.686
(sentimental music playing)

47:02.945 --> 47:04.238
We didn't say goodbye.

47:14.248 --> 47:15.666
I love you, Papa.

47:21.505 --> 47:22.673
Bye, Pop.

47:25.092 --> 47:26.510
Good luck to you, son.

47:36.103 --> 47:40.065
For five years, I've been afraid
I'd wind up standing at my father's grave

47:40.148 --> 47:42.860
thinking about all the things
I wanted to say to him and never did.

47:45.195 --> 47:46.530
Thanks for coming with me.

48:00.711 --> 48:05.215
(theme music playing)
