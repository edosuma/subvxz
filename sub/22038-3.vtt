(car engine revs)

00:23.100 --> 00:26.060
(country music plays)

00:26.060 --> 00:29.270
George Jones.
It's a pretty ordinary name

00:29.270 --> 00:33.270
for a guy whose life and talent
were anything but ordinary.

00:33.270 --> 00:36.390
It wasn't just
the country music world
that loved George.

00:36.390 --> 00:39.770
Frank Sinatra once called him
the second best singer
in the world,

00:39.770 --> 00:45.020
and James Taylor
and Elvis Costello both
liked George Jones so much,

00:45.020 --> 00:46.470
they each
wrote songs for him.

00:46.470 --> 00:49.140
Now, whether you're
a country music fan or not,

00:49.140 --> 00:51.810
that kind of respect
deserves attention.

Even after they split up,
they kept on singing together,
which makes sense.

01:53.180 --> 01:56.430
They had every chance
to kill each other
as husband and wife,

01:56.430 --> 02:00.520
and each of them
took a stab at it
at least once.

02:00.520 --> 02:02.520
(theme music playing)

02:16.220 --> 02:19.930
George Jones named
his backing band
The Jones Boys.

02:19.930 --> 02:22.180
They were
actually real brothers--

02:22.180 --> 02:24.020
Don, Gary,
and Arnie Adams--

02:24.020 --> 02:26.890
and they spent more time
on the bus with George

02:26.890 --> 02:28.730
than just about anybody.

02:30.020 --> 02:33.100
We was playing in Bandera,
Texas, one night.

02:33.100 --> 02:35.640
We would open up
for George sometimes...

02:35.640 --> 02:36.890
And he was
out in the crowd,

02:36.890 --> 02:38.270
drinking at the table.
Thank you very much.

02:38.270 --> 02:40.560
Right now,
we'd like to introduce
our boss to you.

02:40.560 --> 02:42.020
We'd like everybody
to get together,

02:42.020 --> 02:43.520
give a great big hand,
(cheering)

02:43.520 --> 02:46.600
to America's number one
country singer, George Jones.

02:46.600 --> 02:49.180
(country music plays)

02:49.180 --> 02:52.310
Don:
He throwed the whiskey bottle
at me on the bandstand.

02:52.310 --> 02:55.270
It missed me
about that far.
(bottle shatters)

02:55.270 --> 02:57.600
When we was finally--
got done that night,

02:57.600 --> 03:01.430
well, we just walked off-stage.
What-what, we quit.

03:01.430 --> 03:03.390
Went and started loading
the car and trailer up,

03:03.390 --> 03:07.730
and I heard gravel
shuffling behind me
when I was putting stuff in.

03:07.730 --> 03:09.520
And I turned around
and he took a swing,

03:09.520 --> 03:10.850
and I took
the trailer door...

03:10.850 --> 03:12.810
(grunts)
...and hit him
in the face with it.

03:12.810 --> 03:14.930
(laughter)
It knocked him down,

03:14.930 --> 03:16.890
and the sheriff was standing
down there and he said,

03:16.890 --> 03:18.350
"What do you want me
to do with him, Don?"

03:18.350 --> 03:19.930
And I said,
"Put him in jail."

03:19.930 --> 03:21.350
(laughter)

03:21.350 --> 03:22.930
So they put him in jail,

03:22.930 --> 03:24.560
and I took his car
and went home.

03:24.560 --> 03:25.730
(tires screech)

03:25.730 --> 03:27.680
And he called us
and fired us the next day.

03:27.680 --> 03:31.980
He had fired him
four or five times
before that ever happened.

03:31.980 --> 03:34.020
He got be, kind of, like
Donald Trump.

03:34.020 --> 03:35.470
(laughter)

03:35.470 --> 03:39.470
Mike: George came
from humble beginnings
in Vidor, Texas.

03:39.470 --> 03:42.600
Songwriter Peanutt Montgomery
and his wife, Charlene,

03:42.600 --> 03:45.020
were running buddies
with him for decades.

03:45.020 --> 03:48.100
We were close, uh,
as, I guess, buddies

03:48.100 --> 03:50.020
could get, you know.

03:50.020 --> 03:53.470
I'd tell him I loved him,
and he said, "Now, Peanutt,

03:53.470 --> 03:55.850
if we were any closer,
we'd be gay."

03:55.850 --> 03:58.390
(laughter)

03:58.390 --> 04:00.600
Charlene:
George came
from the Big Thicket.

04:00.600 --> 04:02.600
It's a little community
there in Vidor--

04:02.600 --> 04:06.770
tall pines
and everybody there
was like poverty people,

04:06.770 --> 04:08.680
but they didn't know
they were poverty,

04:08.680 --> 04:10.390
because everybody
lived the same life,

04:10.390 --> 04:12.520
so one had just about
as much as the other.

04:12.520 --> 04:16.020
And in the Thicket,
they had their own
little set of rules,

04:16.020 --> 04:19.350
standards, and values,
and they stuck by those.

04:19.350 --> 04:21.680
Mike: Long before
the good people
of East Texas

04:21.680 --> 04:25.310
had figured out how
to make crystal meth,
they made moonshine,

04:25.310 --> 04:27.140
which was also illegal,

04:27.140 --> 04:29.810
so it stands
to reason that a boy
from the Big Thicket

04:29.810 --> 04:33.060
would get his first
number-one hit with a song
about moonshine.

05:19.890 --> 05:22.020
as far as the singing
and the music,

05:22.020 --> 05:24.810
but, uh, he was
such a... a prick

05:24.810 --> 05:27.600
as far as, uh,
off-stage, drinking,

05:27.600 --> 05:29.520
and stuff like that.
Yeah.

05:29.520 --> 05:32.100
Gary:
Paycheck worked for George
four or five times.

05:32.100 --> 05:34.310
Arnie:
Him and George
was two of a kind.

05:34.310 --> 05:36.390
We kind of like
grew up together,
you know.

05:36.390 --> 05:38.100
Paycheck,
he was always drunk,

05:38.100 --> 05:40.270
and him and George
fought all the time.

05:40.270 --> 05:44.220
We was riding down to Virginia
or somewhere late at night,

05:44.220 --> 05:46.100
and George and John
was up in the front seat,

05:46.100 --> 05:48.850
and George was driving,
and they got to arguing
about something,

05:48.850 --> 05:50.350
because they argued
all the time,

05:50.350 --> 05:52.520
and, uh, they started
screaming at each other.
(chuckles)

05:52.520 --> 05:55.430
Paycheck said,
"Well, just pull this
son of a bitch over.

05:55.430 --> 05:56.600
I'll just whip your ass."

05:56.600 --> 05:59.310
George said,
"By God, all right."

05:59.310 --> 06:01.270
Pulled her over,
and John jumped out,

06:01.270 --> 06:03.730
and George took off.
(guys laugh)

06:03.730 --> 06:07.100
George wasn't no scholar
by no means.

06:07.100 --> 06:12.430
We'd talked him
into going into the hospital
to dry out in, uh, Alabama.

06:12.430 --> 06:14.560
They did an IQ test on him.

06:14.560 --> 06:16.980
I asked the doctor,
"What was the score?"

06:16.980 --> 06:18.850
He said, "62."

06:18.850 --> 06:21.980
(guys laugh)
Where'd that put you?

06:21.980 --> 06:24.100
Well, dumb enough
to work for him!

06:26.930 --> 06:29.810
George and I was riding along
on the bus there one time

06:29.810 --> 06:32.220
and we was listening
to the radio,

06:32.220 --> 06:35.140
and we heard a song
that Johnny Paycheck
had written.

06:35.140 --> 06:36.930
It was called
"Apartment Number Nine."

06:36.930 --> 06:42.270
Tammy Wynette:
♪ You'll find me waiting here ♪

06:43.350 --> 06:47.390
♪ In apartment number nine ♪

06:47.390 --> 06:49.560
George said,
"Man, who is that singing?"

06:49.560 --> 06:51.470
And it was
young Tammy Wynette,

06:51.470 --> 06:53.140
who nobody'd heard of yet.

06:53.140 --> 06:55.470
Mike:
You can see
where this is headed.

06:55.470 --> 06:58.600
Scott Kennedy runs
a Tammy Wynette museum,

06:58.600 --> 07:01.680
near the cotton fields
where she grew up
in Mississippi.

07:01.680 --> 07:03.310
Scott:
Tammy, along
with everybody else

07:03.310 --> 07:05.850
in Tremont, Mississippi,
picked cotton.

07:05.850 --> 07:07.430
Tammy didn't like
to pick cotton,

07:07.430 --> 07:08.470
but she had to.

07:08.470 --> 07:09.890
When she was
out there
in those fields,

07:09.890 --> 07:12.600
to help pass the time away,
well, she'd start singing,

07:12.600 --> 07:14.640
and it just made
the cotton picking
go better.

07:14.640 --> 07:16.350
When she was picking
that cotton down there,

07:16.350 --> 07:19.390
she was just
waiting for the day
and designing her costumes,

07:19.390 --> 07:22.020
when she was gonna be
on the stage with her hero,

07:22.020 --> 07:24.680
George Jones,
singing hit tunes.

07:24.680 --> 07:28.220
Mike:
Janette and her sister,
Nanette, ought to know.

07:28.220 --> 07:32.180
The Smith sisters
took turns over the years
doing Tammy's hair,

07:32.180 --> 07:35.350
as well as just about
everybody else's
in Nashville.

07:35.350 --> 07:36.520
Jim Nabors.

07:36.520 --> 07:37.560
Ray Charles.

07:37.560 --> 07:39.390
Ah! Gene Kelly.

07:39.390 --> 07:40.930
Jerry Lee Lewis.

07:40.930 --> 07:42.100
Burt Reynolds.

07:42.100 --> 07:43.980
Oh! Reba.

07:43.980 --> 07:47.730
Tammy was born
with the name
Virginia Wynette Pugh.

07:47.730 --> 07:50.310
She got married before
she graduated from high school.

07:50.310 --> 07:52.930
I think it was
because she felt like

07:52.930 --> 07:54.390
she didn't belong
to anybody.

07:54.390 --> 07:57.890
It was pretty well known
that Tammy always
loved the boys.

07:57.890 --> 08:01.430
She had to have
a man in her life

08:01.430 --> 08:02.810
all of the time,

08:02.810 --> 08:06.060
and she made
some of the worst
dadgum choices.

08:06.060 --> 08:08.770
Mike:
Her first choice
in terms of marriage

08:08.770 --> 08:12.180
was a young man
by the name of Euple Byrd.

08:12.180 --> 08:16.390
Now, Tammy had dated
all the Byrd brothers,

08:16.390 --> 08:18.560
but she ended up
marrying Euple.

08:18.560 --> 08:21.850
It was, uh,
a very tortured romance.

08:21.850 --> 08:24.430
Mike:
Big words
for Jimmy McDonough,

08:24.430 --> 08:26.770
a gonzo journalist
with bylines

08:26.770 --> 08:27.930
in the  Village Voice,

08:27.930 --> 08:29.810
Mojo, Spin,

08:29.810 --> 08:31.770
and  Juggs.

08:31.770 --> 08:33.350
They moved into a log cabin

08:33.350 --> 08:35.100
on her grand-pappy's property,

08:35.100 --> 08:37.020
and no running water,

08:37.020 --> 08:38.850
no electricity, no stove.

08:38.850 --> 08:40.680
Immediately,
they started
making babies,

08:40.680 --> 08:42.470
and they ended up
having three kids.

08:42.470 --> 08:44.350
She gets
a hairdresser's license,

08:44.350 --> 08:46.810
'cause Euple wasn't
bringing in any dough.

08:46.810 --> 08:48.730
She was never
really in poverty,

08:48.730 --> 08:51.470
except after she
married Euple and lived
in that cabin back there.

08:51.470 --> 08:52.770
Both:
Euple Byrd.

08:52.770 --> 08:55.390
So this was a grim period
in her life.

08:55.390 --> 08:57.310
Tammy had suffered
with depression

08:57.310 --> 08:58.810
and ended up
getting shock treatment.

08:58.810 --> 09:01.060
Janette:
So, one day,
she says to Euple,

09:01.060 --> 09:03.310
"I'm still going to Nashville
to become a star.

09:03.310 --> 09:04.640
I'm going to be a star."

09:04.640 --> 09:05.890
And Euple said,

09:05.890 --> 09:08.730
"Dream on, baby.
Dream on."

09:08.730 --> 09:11.310
At some point there,
Tammy just decides,

09:11.310 --> 09:12.810
"I'm going to Nashville."

09:12.810 --> 09:15.470
She packs up
her belongings, her kids--

09:15.470 --> 09:17.980
there's a tricycle tied
to the top of the roof...

09:17.980 --> 09:21.560
(engine starts, revs)
...and she leaves Euple.

09:21.560 --> 09:23.180
Mike:
Choice number two
for Tammy,

09:23.180 --> 09:26.890
after she left Euple,
got her a little closer
to her dream.

09:26.890 --> 09:29.060
She took
her three kids
to Nashville

09:29.060 --> 09:32.270
and hitched her wagon
to a man named Don Chapel.

09:32.270 --> 09:34.930
Now, Don is
a good songwriter

09:34.930 --> 09:38.520
and also a mediocre singer
who wears a bad wig,

09:38.520 --> 09:41.770
but he's pitching songs
to George Jones,

09:41.770 --> 09:43.680
and Jones is recording 'em.

09:43.680 --> 09:45.850
Don had written
a song for George,

09:45.850 --> 09:47.430
and Tammy
was aware of that,

09:47.430 --> 09:49.180
so she gets in thick
with Don Chapel.

09:49.180 --> 09:51.560
I guess they fell
in love or in heat.

09:51.560 --> 09:53.020
Who knows?
But they married.

09:53.020 --> 09:55.770
Mike:
It lasted all
of about eight months.

09:55.770 --> 09:57.680
That's how long
it took for Don Chapel

09:57.680 --> 10:00.520
to introduce
his new wife
to George Jones.

10:00.520 --> 10:02.850
It all happened
in a cheap motel room.

10:02.850 --> 10:05.850
They'd gone there to try
to sell George a song.

10:05.850 --> 10:07.430
She walked
into the motel room,

10:07.430 --> 10:09.890
and he was in the bed
with another woman.

10:09.890 --> 10:12.180
I think it might
have been two women.

10:12.180 --> 10:13.390
Oh, dear God.

10:13.390 --> 10:17.140
Tammy said,
"He didn't even notice
I was there."

10:17.140 --> 10:21.350
That, for Tammy Wynette,
is a challenge.

10:21.350 --> 10:22.850
Shortly after that meeting,

10:22.850 --> 10:26.980
Don and Tammy
start doing shows
with George Jones,

10:26.980 --> 10:29.680
and George walked out
on stage one night

10:29.680 --> 10:32.060
and sang a song
with Tammy.

10:32.060 --> 10:36.060
Next thing you know,
Jones and Tammy are
getting cozy,

10:36.060 --> 10:37.680
you know, on the road.

10:37.680 --> 10:40.430
And according
to one tour manager,

10:40.430 --> 10:43.390
they had a little
assignation in a motel.

10:43.390 --> 10:46.520
He said that Jones' eyes
were as big as saucers,

10:46.520 --> 10:49.270
and he said,
"Do you know
what she did?

10:49.270 --> 10:51.600
Tammy done sucked my toes."

10:51.600 --> 10:53.020
(chuckles)

10:53.020 --> 10:55.730
His toes?
It really was his toes?

10:55.730 --> 10:57.470
That's probably right.

10:57.470 --> 10:59.020
Mike:
This act of passion

10:59.020 --> 11:01.180
apparently sealed
the deal for George.

11:01.180 --> 11:05.560
Now, no one knows
exactly what Tammy's husband,
Don, knew or didn't know,

11:05.560 --> 11:08.930
but for some reason,
he invited George
over for dinner.

11:08.930 --> 11:11.890
Of course,
Tammy is making ham
and dumplings or whatever.

11:11.890 --> 11:14.060
You know,
she'd put on the spread,

11:14.060 --> 11:16.890
and Don Chapel talked to her

11:16.890 --> 11:21.430
like she was a piece
of dung on his shoe.

11:21.430 --> 11:23.270
And George Jones
gets up,

11:23.270 --> 11:25.020
flips the table over,

11:25.020 --> 11:27.310
and throws a chair
through the window.

11:28.770 --> 11:32.100
George says,
"Tammy, I love you,
and you love me.

11:32.100 --> 11:33.730
Get the kids.
We're out of here."

11:33.730 --> 11:35.520
Honey, she didn't
even grab her coat.

11:35.520 --> 11:38.890
She walked out that door
and never looked back.

11:38.890 --> 11:40.100
And it's the beginning

11:40.100 --> 11:41.600
of George Jones
and Tammy Wynette.

11:41.600 --> 11:44.350
Both:
♪ Well, I'm gonna
get on the old turnpike ♪

11:44.350 --> 11:46.350
♪ And I'm gonna ride ♪

11:46.350 --> 11:50.980
♪ I'm gonna leave this town
till you decide ♪

11:50.980 --> 11:54.890
♪ Which one you want the most,
them Opry stars or me ♪

11:54.890 --> 11:59.850
♪ Milwaukee, here I come
from Nashville, Tennessee ♪

11:59.850 --> 12:03.270
Jimmy:
George and Tammy
started touring together

12:03.270 --> 12:05.850
and rode together
in a bus, and boys,

12:05.850 --> 12:07.890
and were Mr. and Mrs.
Country Music.

12:07.890 --> 12:10.390
They were
like movie stars.

12:10.390 --> 12:12.430
Mike:
One of their
first big admirers

12:12.430 --> 12:15.430
was Tammy's first husband,
Euple Byrd.

12:15.430 --> 12:17.890
One night we're out
on the road, on concert,

12:17.890 --> 12:19.730
and Euple walks
up to the stage

12:19.730 --> 12:21.560
and stands in line
to get an autograph.

12:21.560 --> 12:22.850
Both:
Euple Byrd.

12:22.850 --> 12:25.980
Nanette:
And he says,
"Can I have your autograph?"

12:25.980 --> 12:29.680
And Tammy says,
"Dream on, baby.
Dream on."

12:29.680 --> 12:32.890
George and Tammy:
♪ No, we're not the jet set ♪

12:34.520 --> 12:36.430
♪ We're the old Chevrolet set ♪

12:36.430 --> 12:37.730
Janette:
She had that style.

12:37.730 --> 12:40.100
What I think
is very interesting,

12:40.100 --> 12:43.350
that Tammy Wynette
let us do her hair,

12:43.350 --> 12:45.180
and she was
a hairdresser.

12:45.180 --> 12:47.560
In her first career,
she did hair.

12:47.560 --> 12:51.680
Baby fine, thin hair--
Tammy Wynette's
hair was--

12:51.680 --> 12:53.470
She had the hair
of a frog.

12:53.470 --> 12:55.430
Thank God for wigs.

12:55.430 --> 12:58.850
Scott:
Tammy Wynette was a lady,
and she was classy,

12:58.850 --> 13:00.430
and so she looks
at George and says,

13:00.430 --> 13:02.640
"Well, maybe
I can 'teen' you up
just a little bit."

13:02.640 --> 13:04.520
When I went
to work for George,

13:04.520 --> 13:07.770
he had already
been nicknamed
"The Possum."

13:07.770 --> 13:10.680
The reason for that was
'cause he looked like one.

13:10.680 --> 13:15.560
His eyes was--
Yeah, his eyes was, uh,
way too close together.

13:15.560 --> 13:18.100
Of course,
you know, Tammy has
that background in hairdos,

13:18.100 --> 13:20.060
so she thought, "Well,
that little crew cut

13:20.060 --> 13:21.520
"you've been wearing
for all these years,

13:21.520 --> 13:23.140
that's not gonna get that
right now, George."

13:23.140 --> 13:26.140
So he wears it long,
and she combs it back.

13:26.140 --> 13:28.350
And some of their friends
said, "Maybe it looks

13:28.350 --> 13:30.600
like Cornelius
from The Planet of the Apes.

13:30.600 --> 13:34.430
(dramatic music plays)

13:34.430 --> 13:37.430
Mike:
Tammy was grooming George
to be the perfect husband,

13:37.430 --> 13:41.560
but I think
we all know it just
doesn't work like that.

13:41.560 --> 13:44.810
When Tammy married George,
she was aware that he drank,

13:44.810 --> 13:47.220
and she really thought,
"Well, I can change him,"

13:47.220 --> 13:50.430
and that became
very obvious quickly that
that wasn't the case.

13:50.430 --> 13:52.680
Tammy was not a boozer.
She didn't drink.

13:52.680 --> 13:56.140
George Jones was an alcoholic.
He wanted to get drunk.

13:56.140 --> 13:58.600
Mike:
Wayne Oliver was
a 20-year-old kid

13:58.600 --> 14:00.270
when he first encountered
the legend.

14:00.270 --> 14:04.270
He was one of several
managers Jones would have
over the years.

14:04.270 --> 14:06.310
Started out George liked
Bloody Marys.

14:06.310 --> 14:08.730
You know, he liked
to have a couple of them
in the mornings

14:08.730 --> 14:12.140
with some celery, peppers,
and spices he could get.

14:12.140 --> 14:15.810
And then we'd go have lunch,
and he'd like a couple beers,

14:15.810 --> 14:18.470
and then he'd go
to Jack and Coke,

14:18.470 --> 14:20.390
sometimes straight Jack.

14:20.390 --> 14:22.220
He liked that whiskey.
He did.

14:22.220 --> 14:24.470
(both laugh)
But George wanted to drink,

14:24.470 --> 14:26.180
believe me, brother,
he'd get it.

14:26.180 --> 14:28.390
I used to have
to feed him raw potatoes.

14:28.390 --> 14:30.930
People'd say,
"Well, why do you carry
a bag of potatoes around?"

14:30.930 --> 14:33.640
Because that starch
would soak up that alcohol.

14:33.640 --> 14:35.600
He would put salt
all over 'em,

14:35.600 --> 14:37.470
and he loved
them raw potatoes.

14:39.270 --> 14:42.640
I remember one time
when Jones and I were
sitting on the bus,

14:42.640 --> 14:46.390
he said, "Come on, Nanette,
have a drink with me."

14:46.390 --> 14:48.730
And I said, "George,
I don't want a drink."

14:48.730 --> 14:51.020
So he goes back
where the closets are,

14:51.020 --> 14:52.470
comes out
with a bottle of vodka,

14:52.470 --> 14:54.470
hands it to me,
and says, "Drink it."

14:54.470 --> 14:57.140
He gets drunk
on his ass, man.

14:57.140 --> 14:58.810
George goes on stage,

14:58.810 --> 15:00.980
he can't remember
the words to the songs.

15:00.980 --> 15:03.310
He didn't know if he was
on stage or off stage.

15:03.310 --> 15:04.600
He didn't know
where he was.

15:04.600 --> 15:07.060
Janette:
They would sing
real close to the microphone

15:07.060 --> 15:09.430
so he could read
Tammy's lips.
(chuckles)

15:09.430 --> 15:11.310
Nanette:
They would be singing,
and Tammy'd go--

15:11.310 --> 15:13.310
and she'd poke him,
"Okay, it's your turn."

15:13.310 --> 15:15.600
She was always
instructing him
when to go.

15:15.600 --> 15:18.270
Mike:
There was no one George
liked to spend his days

15:18.270 --> 15:22.060
drinking with more
than country music legend,
Waylon Jennings.

15:22.060 --> 15:24.890
Sadly, his son, Shooter,
was present during many

15:24.890 --> 15:27.270
of their marathon
drinking sessions.

15:27.270 --> 15:29.100
Well, I remember
when I was little,

15:29.100 --> 15:31.140
George Jones would come over
to our house,

15:31.140 --> 15:33.640
and there was one time when
he just got drunk and he was,

15:33.640 --> 15:35.730
he would get angry,
and he'd get angry
at my dad.

15:35.730 --> 15:38.890
And I think he called him
a "Conway Twitty singing
son of a bitch."

15:39.890 --> 15:42.060
♪ Bum, bum, bum ♪

15:42.060 --> 15:44.020
Shooter:
And that's when my dad
tied him to the tree.

15:44.020 --> 15:46.470
(grunting)
He was out there
screaming, you know,

15:46.470 --> 15:49.220
"I'm the greatest
country music singer
of all time!"

15:49.220 --> 15:52.560
And my dad opened the door
and said, "Yeah, and you're
fucking tied to a tree,"

15:52.560 --> 15:54.560
then slammed the door,
you know?

15:54.560 --> 15:56.350
Then later,
he was around,
he was fine.

15:56.350 --> 16:01.350
Mike: By all accounts,
George had another problem
with another Nashville legend.

16:01.350 --> 16:04.680
Tammy had confided in him
that she had been friendly

16:04.680 --> 16:08.020
with the great Porter Wagoner
when she first got to town.

16:08.020 --> 16:11.270
Porter Wagoner had--
okay, first of all,
he had great hair.

16:11.270 --> 16:14.850
He had a great pompadour.
He wore fabulous Nudie suits--

16:14.850 --> 16:18.020
I mean,
decked out to the nines
with rhinestones.

16:18.020 --> 16:19.850
George Jones
and Porter Wagoner

16:19.850 --> 16:22.020
were booked
on The Grand
Ole Opry together,

16:22.020 --> 16:25.390
so George got to thinking
that Porter and Tammy

16:25.390 --> 16:27.680
had something going on,
like a romance.

16:27.680 --> 16:30.140
So, he saw Porter
go to the bathroom,
(unzips)

16:30.140 --> 16:32.980
so George follows Porter
into the bathroom.
(door opens)

16:32.980 --> 16:37.180
I do know
that Porter Wagoner's
penis proceeds him.

16:37.180 --> 16:40.270
I mean, his reputation--
The reputation
of the size of his penis...

16:40.270 --> 16:42.600
Both:
Proceeds him.
(laughs)

16:42.600 --> 16:44.560
Charlene:
George walked up
behind Porter,

16:44.560 --> 16:47.600
said, "I want to see
what it is Tammy's
so proud of."

16:47.600 --> 16:49.270
And he reached
around Porter,

16:49.270 --> 16:51.770
got a hold of his penis,
and twisted it real hard.

16:51.770 --> 16:52.930
(grunting, scuffling)

16:52.930 --> 16:55.640
George said that Porter
didn't move much on stage,

16:55.640 --> 16:57.980
but said he moved a lot
down there in that bathroom.

16:57.980 --> 17:01.770
He said his Nudie suit
got to glittering
all over the place.

17:01.770 --> 17:03.520
Mike:
A few years
into the marriage,

17:03.520 --> 17:06.270
George and Tammy
decided maybe it would
be for the best

17:06.270 --> 17:08.060
if they got out
of Nashville.

17:08.060 --> 17:10.390
They started house hunting
in Florida.

17:10.390 --> 17:12.560
Charlene:
When things go shaky,
Tammy would say,

17:12.560 --> 17:15.390
"George, let's go
out and look around
at some houses."

17:15.390 --> 17:17.020
Well, that was
right up George's alley.

17:17.020 --> 17:19.680
George Jones loved
interior decorating.

17:19.680 --> 17:22.100
Red and black was
his favorite color,

17:22.100 --> 17:24.980
and velvet paint--
(laughs) paintings.

17:24.980 --> 17:27.980
Velvet wallpaper.
It's just-- ugh!

17:27.980 --> 17:29.270
The bed was mirrored

17:29.270 --> 17:31.850
with drapes
down the side
of the bed

17:31.850 --> 17:33.180
that were heavy velvet.

17:33.180 --> 17:34.810
(laughing)

17:34.810 --> 17:37.310
It's the damnedest thing
you've ever seen in your life.

17:37.310 --> 17:38.770
Mike:
Tammy let George decorate

17:38.770 --> 17:41.060
their plantation manor
in Lakeland, Florida,

17:41.060 --> 17:43.730
with help
from a local
furniture store,

17:43.730 --> 17:46.140
and then he and Tammy
returned the favor.

17:46.140 --> 17:47.640
Tammy and I
would like to tell you

17:47.640 --> 17:49.270
about some friends of ours,

17:49.270 --> 17:52.350
the folks at Badcock
Home Furnishing Centers.

17:52.350 --> 17:54.310
Both:
Badcock.

17:54.310 --> 17:57.520
B-A-D-C-O-C-K.
Badcock.

17:57.520 --> 17:59.140
Both:
Badcock.

17:59.140 --> 18:00.430
Yeah, it's Badcock.

18:00.430 --> 18:04.850
Take it from us,
Badcock will treat you right.

18:04.850 --> 18:08.390
Mike: George managed
to decorate just about
everything they owned,

18:08.390 --> 18:12.770
so Tammy set him loose
on the only unrenovated
space they had left.

18:12.770 --> 18:16.470
We had bought a bus one time,
and George had taken the bus,

18:16.470 --> 18:20.430
stripped it all down,
and they put bunk beds
and everything in it.

18:20.430 --> 18:23.470
I mean, it looked
nice and decorative,
and stuff like that,

18:23.470 --> 18:25.680
with pictures hanging
on the wall.

18:25.680 --> 18:28.980
I mean, hanging.
Not fastened, but hanging.

18:28.980 --> 18:32.350
He had the bunk beds
setting on the floor.

18:32.350 --> 18:35.220
Not nailed down,
but just setting on there.

18:35.220 --> 18:37.140
He kinda liked
the shag carpet.

18:37.140 --> 18:39.890
We had shag everywhere.
On the walls.

18:39.890 --> 18:42.890
Gary:
So consequently,
we was coming around a curve,

18:42.890 --> 18:45.180
and the driver
couldn't drive
to begin with.

18:45.180 --> 18:47.310
He ran it
off of a mountain.

18:47.310 --> 18:51.270
Everything in there
came crashing up
to the front.

18:51.270 --> 18:53.520
(chuckles)
George got
his chest bone cracked.

18:53.520 --> 18:56.180
I got a bed rail
upside my head.
(banging)

18:56.180 --> 18:57.520
We couldn't
hardly get out,

18:57.520 --> 18:59.270
'cause it
was setting
on its nose.

18:59.270 --> 19:01.470
George, he didn't like
to tour anyhow.

19:01.470 --> 19:04.180
I don't think he really liked
to be out there on stage.

19:04.180 --> 19:06.640
Mike: It turns out
the reigning king

19:06.640 --> 19:10.730
of country music
didn't really like performing
country music in public,

19:10.730 --> 19:15.600
according to Tammy
and George's daughter,
Tamala Georgette Jones.

19:15.600 --> 19:17.520
Georgette Jones:
He loved music so much,

19:17.520 --> 19:18.730
but he was very, very nervous

19:18.730 --> 19:20.060
when he would sing in public,

19:20.060 --> 19:21.220
'cause he was worried
about how--

19:21.220 --> 19:22.470
what people would think
about him.

19:22.470 --> 19:25.140
And when he became popular
and started doing well,

19:25.140 --> 19:26.850
people would just come up
and hand him drinks...

19:26.850 --> 19:31.100
and he realized
after he had one or two,
he wasn't nervous anymore.

19:31.100 --> 19:35.020
He didn't really think
that that was going to turn
into two or three,

19:35.020 --> 19:36.770
to five or six,
to 10 or 12,

19:36.770 --> 19:38.680
to every night,
to all the time.

19:38.680 --> 19:40.770
He'd get drunk,
and he'd miss shows

19:40.770 --> 19:43.270
and refuse
to go on and just--

19:43.270 --> 19:45.430
he was a belligerent--
Arnie: Mm-hmm.

19:45.430 --> 19:47.390
Gary:
Just a very belligerent guy.

19:47.390 --> 19:50.100
George would take off
in the middle of the night,

19:50.100 --> 19:51.600
and you couldn't find him.

19:51.600 --> 19:54.270
Mike: Old Possum had
a knack for disappearing

19:54.270 --> 19:57.520
throughout his long career,
which probably explains

19:57.520 --> 19:59.640
why he had
so many managers.

19:59.640 --> 20:02.390
Gerald Murray put
in his time on the bus.

20:02.390 --> 20:04.270
George, he hadn't called
in a couple of nights,

20:04.270 --> 20:06.560
so I started getting worried
just a little bit.

20:06.560 --> 20:07.770
We didn't know where he was.

20:07.770 --> 20:09.430
All of a sudden, one day,
he come driving up,

20:09.430 --> 20:10.890
and I said, "Man,
where have you been?"

20:10.890 --> 20:13.310
He said,
"Oh, I've just been
out riding around."

20:13.310 --> 20:15.390
And said,
"Well, where'd you get
that white truck?"

20:15.390 --> 20:17.600
He said, "Well,
I bought it down
at that Chevrolet place."

20:17.600 --> 20:19.350
I sat down,
looked at the mileage,

20:19.350 --> 20:20.850
And I said,
"Where'd you ride to?"

20:20.850 --> 20:24.520
And he said, "Ah."
He said, "I just wanted
to go riding around."

20:24.520 --> 20:26.520
He said, "I picked up
this guy down there,

20:26.520 --> 20:28.390
"and he was, uh,
just kind of homeless.

20:28.390 --> 20:30.850
"We got going down
the road, and I said,

20:30.850 --> 20:32.810
'Well, where you going?'
And he said, 'Four mile.'"

20:32.810 --> 20:35.850
And George said,
"Uh, four miles to where?"

20:35.850 --> 20:37.980
The guy said,
"Four miles."

20:37.980 --> 20:40.560
So they drive on
a little piece and then
George asked him,

20:40.560 --> 20:43.890
he said,
"Uh, four miles to where?"

20:43.890 --> 20:45.310
He said, "Four miles."

20:45.310 --> 20:48.270
So they just keep on
riding down the road
right there,

20:48.270 --> 20:51.140
and George going
four miles to somewhere,
he don't know where,

20:51.140 --> 20:53.850
until he finally realizes
that the guy was saying

20:53.850 --> 20:56.310
Fort Myers... Florida.

20:56.310 --> 20:58.770
Mike: By the time
George figured out where
the guy was headed,

20:58.770 --> 21:03.680
he'd probably
driven over 600 miles,
four miles at a time.

21:03.680 --> 21:05.810
I said,
"What did you do?
And he said,

21:05.810 --> 21:09.430
"Well, I gave him
a little bit of money,
you know."

21:09.430 --> 21:11.310
And I said,
"How much money
did you give him?"

21:11.310 --> 21:12.680
He said, "It wasn't
all that much."

21:12.680 --> 21:14.560
I said, "Well,
how much did you keep?"

21:14.560 --> 21:17.770
He said, "Well,
I kept $20 to get gas,

21:17.770 --> 21:19.470
so I could get home."

21:19.470 --> 21:20.730
And I said, "$20?"

21:20.730 --> 21:23.730
I said,
"But when you left,
you had 25,000."

21:23.730 --> 21:25.180
(cash register dings)

21:25.180 --> 21:27.020
We were always
looking for Jones,

21:27.020 --> 21:28.850
because he got
to be "No-Show Jones."

21:28.850 --> 21:30.730
Possum got
to be No-Show.

21:30.730 --> 21:34.100
They booked him
for The Johnny Carson Show.
He wouldn't go.

21:34.100 --> 21:36.060
He said,
"They'll make fun of me."

21:36.060 --> 21:39.980
And, uh, he missed it.
That's when he was
named No-Show Jones.

21:39.980 --> 21:42.680
I'm not sure
that George Jones
ever thought

21:42.680 --> 21:45.560
about being a star
or wanted to be a star. And--

21:45.560 --> 21:46.890
Or ever knew
he was as star.

21:46.890 --> 21:48.560
Or ever knew
he was as star,

21:48.560 --> 21:51.020
and he didn't give
a damn about money.

21:51.020 --> 21:52.470
He just didn't.

21:52.470 --> 21:54.520
He was with somebody
tough like Waylon,

21:54.520 --> 21:57.270
and he was in a bathroom,
and they were bragging

21:57.270 --> 21:59.180
about how much money
they'd made that night.

21:59.180 --> 22:02.180
And George just started
peeling off $100 bills

22:02.180 --> 22:03.810
and flushing them
down the toilet, you know.

22:03.810 --> 22:06.220
He just had
no respect for money.

22:06.220 --> 22:08.140
George was a car fanatic.

22:08.140 --> 22:11.390
One year, I was with him,
he had 36 brand-new cars.

22:11.390 --> 22:15.310
My favorite car of George's
was this Pontiac Bonneville

22:15.310 --> 22:18.270
that had 4,000
silver dollars embedded

22:18.270 --> 22:21.310
in the dash of the car
and throughout the floor.

22:21.310 --> 22:23.930
And it had bullhorns
on the front of the car,

22:23.930 --> 22:27.520
and the horn made
a sound like a dying bull.

22:27.520 --> 22:29.430
(bull bellows)

22:29.430 --> 22:31.730
That was what
was amazing about Jones.

22:31.730 --> 22:34.100
This was a guy
who just didn't give a damn

22:34.100 --> 22:38.270
and did whatever
he wanted to do
for his own amusement.

22:38.270 --> 22:40.470
That was
an essential part
of this guy,

22:40.470 --> 22:42.270
and it had
to be hard
to live with.

22:42.270 --> 22:45.430
Mike:
When George became
especially hard to live with,

22:45.430 --> 22:49.600
Tammy would
turn to their lawyer,
this guy, Jon Lentz.

22:49.600 --> 22:52.430
One night I was at home,
and Tammy called and said,

22:52.430 --> 22:53.930
"Can you please
come over here?"

22:53.930 --> 22:55.810
George wanted to get
some more whiskey...
(bottle shatters)

22:55.810 --> 22:58.390
...and she threw all
of the car keys
in the bushes

22:58.390 --> 22:59.640
where he couldn't find them.

22:59.640 --> 23:01.980
So he decided to ride
his power mower

23:01.980 --> 23:03.850
toward Melrose Liquors.

23:03.850 --> 23:07.470
And we got in my car
and headed down Franklin Road.

23:07.470 --> 23:11.180
Well, low and behold,
as I looked across
the highway,

23:11.180 --> 23:14.520
there was George
coming back the other way.

23:14.520 --> 23:16.730
He'd already gotten
to Melrose Liquors.

23:16.730 --> 23:18.810
The thing's going
five miles an hour.

23:18.810 --> 23:20.890
He didn't even
turn the blade off,

23:20.890 --> 23:23.680
I mean, so it's
throwing rocks everywhere.

23:23.680 --> 23:26.310
And in his lap he had
a little brown sack.

23:26.310 --> 23:30.810
I made a U-turn
on Franklin Road,
pulled up beside George.

23:30.810 --> 23:34.520
Tammy just
rolled down the window
and let him have it.

23:34.520 --> 23:36.310
I hardly ever
heard her curse,

23:36.310 --> 23:39.180
and she said,
"You stupid son of a bitch,
you're gonna get killed!"

23:39.180 --> 23:42.680
And George acted
completely oblivious
to all of this.

23:42.680 --> 23:44.600
He would not acknowledge
our presence.

23:44.600 --> 23:47.600
He didn't look at Tammy.
He didn't look at the car.

23:47.600 --> 23:52.020
He just kept driving
this power mower
down the highway.

23:52.020 --> 23:54.020
When we got
back to the house,
George stopped.

23:54.020 --> 23:57.390
He turned around
and looked at me,
he said, "Hi, Jon."

23:57.390 --> 24:00.020
I said, "Hi, George."
And he said, "Well,

24:00.020 --> 24:02.560
"as you can see my wife
is a little upset with me,

24:02.560 --> 24:05.220
"so if you don't mind,
I'm going to excuse myself,

24:05.220 --> 24:08.470
go to my bedroom,
lock myself in,
and get drunk."

24:08.470 --> 24:11.140
One time,
she took the keys
from the lawn mower.

24:11.140 --> 24:13.520

a bunch of a horses,
