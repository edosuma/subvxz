WEBVTT

00:02.670 --> 00:04.603
(country music plays)
(telephone rings)

00:04.605 --> 00:06.305
Cattleman's Ranch,
how may I help you?

00:06.307 --> 00:08.273
MAN: I'd like to place an order
for pickup.

00:08.275 --> 00:10.009
Oh, I'm sorry.
We don't do takeout.

00:10.011 --> 00:13.212
I'll take a rib plate with a
side of your mashed po-tah-toes.

00:13.214 --> 00:15.114
Uh, potatoes, and we don't do...

00:15.116 --> 00:17.683
A large coleslaw, extra cole...
Okay, sir...

00:17.685 --> 00:19.818
and two
of your fancy cookie pies.

00:19.820 --> 00:22.121
Sir, we don't do takeout
at Cattleman's.

00:22.123 --> 00:24.023
We do now.

00:25.126 --> 00:27.960
We're getting in the to-go game.

00:27.962 --> 00:30.329
Sir, sorry to keep you waiting.

00:30.331 --> 00:32.398
Uh, you are never going
to believe this.

00:32.400 --> 00:36.201
It turns out we just started
doing to-go, like, right now.

00:39.540 --> 00:41.006
¶ Fresh off the boat ¶

00:41.008 --> 00:42.674
¶ I'm gettin' mine
everywhere I go ¶

00:42.676 --> 00:44.576
¶ If you don't know, homey,
now you know ¶

00:44.578 --> 00:46.178
¶ Fresh off the boat ¶

00:46.180 --> 00:48.380
¶ Homey, you don't know
where I come from ¶

00:48.382 --> 00:49.915
¶ But I know where I'm goin' ¶

00:49.917 --> 00:52.651
¶ I'm fresh off the boat ¶

00:52.653 --> 00:55.888
(up-tempo music playing)

00:55.890 --> 00:57.956
(birds squawking)

01:00.227 --> 01:01.827
It's too loud. Turn it down.

01:01.829 --> 01:03.429
(sighs)

01:03.431 --> 01:05.330
It's down.

01:05.332 --> 01:08.500
I think if the three of us
were stuck on a deserted island,

01:08.502 --> 01:09.868
we'd be fine.

01:09.870 --> 01:11.170
We totally would be.

01:11.172 --> 01:13.205
I'm great
at finding fresh water.

01:13.207 --> 01:14.606
And I know how to start a fire.

01:14.608 --> 01:16.241
And I'd drink a glass
of that fresh water

01:16.243 --> 01:18.177
while using the fire
to cook and eat both of you.

01:18.179 --> 01:19.511
What? What?

01:19.513 --> 01:20.879
Don't kid yourselves.

01:20.881 --> 01:22.014
A few days of starvation,

01:22.016 --> 01:23.549
and you'd be trying to eat me,
too.

01:23.551 --> 01:25.017
I'd eat berries.

01:25.019 --> 01:26.718
There are no berries.

01:26.720 --> 01:28.220
No berries?

01:28.222 --> 01:29.354
(ducks quacking)

01:29.356 --> 01:31.857
Eddie, turn those ducks down!

01:31.859 --> 01:33.258
(door opens, closes)

01:33.260 --> 01:35.527
Now entering the square circle,

01:35.529 --> 01:40.365
the Intercontinental Champion
of the World,

01:40.367 --> 01:43.135
Louis "The Animal" Steele!

01:43.137 --> 01:43.969
Yay! Dad's home!

01:43.971 --> 01:45.537
Ahh! (Growls)

01:45.539 --> 01:47.039
Me eat turnbuckle!

01:47.041 --> 01:48.941
Rawr! (Laughter)

01:48.943 --> 01:50.909
When did this couch
get so lumpy?

01:50.911 --> 01:52.811
It's not the couch! It's Evan!

01:52.813 --> 01:54.947
You guys hear something?
The wind?

01:54.949 --> 01:56.582
Evan! You hear Evan!

01:56.584 --> 01:58.050
You're sitting on me!

01:58.052 --> 01:59.751
Evan, when did you get there?

01:59.753 --> 02:01.320
Hey, watch this.

02:01.322 --> 02:03.088
Kid 'n Play.

02:03.090 --> 02:05.124
Kid 'n Play. Oh!

02:05.126 --> 02:06.458
Whoo! You're the best!

02:06.460 --> 02:07.826
Dad, you rock!
Dad, you're the best!

02:07.828 --> 02:11.063
Ah, Hector made
chocolate cake today.

02:11.065 --> 02:12.064
Brought you guys some.

02:12.066 --> 02:13.165
Cake!

02:13.167 --> 02:15.234
Okay, everybody. Time for bed.

02:15.236 --> 02:16.602
(all sigh)

02:16.604 --> 02:18.937
Hey, now, now.
Listen to your mother.

02:18.939 --> 02:21.220
(whispering) You can eat it
in your room.

02:21.742 --> 02:23.742
Brush your teeth after.

02:23.744 --> 02:25.210
Don't brush.

02:26.780 --> 02:28.080
(sighs)

02:28.082 --> 02:30.015
You are the only one
who can tear them away

02:30.017 --> 02:32.117
from<i> The Adventures</i>
<i>of Baby Ducks Screaming.</i>

02:32.119 --> 02:34.253
Well, I've been putting in
so much time at work

02:34.255 --> 02:36.155
getting ready to launch
Cattleman's To-Go,

02:36.157 --> 02:37.789
I only get to see them
for a few minutes a night.

02:37.791 --> 02:39.124
Got to make them count.

02:39.126 --> 02:40.859
Well, maybe you wouldn't
have to work so hard

02:40.861 --> 02:42.461
if you hired competent help.

02:42.463 --> 02:44.630
My staff is more than competent.

02:44.632 --> 02:46.932
They have the instincts
of a goldfish...

02:46.934 --> 02:51.203
Eyes wide open, mouths moving,
swallowing air,

02:51.205 --> 02:53.172
can't tell flakes from poop.

02:53.174 --> 02:54.673
What was that?

02:54.675 --> 02:56.375
Did you just ask
for a Kid 'n Play?

02:56.377 --> 02:57.376
No.

02:57.378 --> 02:58.844
Mm, someone did.

02:59.780 --> 03:02.447
(screams) (groans)

03:03.851 --> 03:06.919
¶¶

03:08.889 --> 03:10.355
(wolf-whistles)

03:15.496 --> 03:17.029
Ma, I'm getting dressed.

03:25.172 --> 03:27.372
There's no way
you're going to work today.

03:27.374 --> 03:28.974
You can't even get dressed.

03:28.976 --> 03:30.909
It's the first day
of Cattleman's To-Go.

03:30.911 --> 03:32.144
I have to be there.

03:32.146 --> 03:33.645
Just let the staff handle it.

03:33.647 --> 03:35.147
There's no way they can manage.

03:35.149 --> 03:36.481
I thought you said
they were competent.

03:36.483 --> 03:38.650
When I'm there
to supervise them.

03:38.652 --> 03:39.551
On their own, they're...

03:39.553 --> 03:40.633
Goldfish?

03:43.490 --> 03:44.923
That's actually
a pretty good Mitch.

03:44.925 --> 03:45.757
(chuckles)

03:45.759 --> 03:47.492
No, I can do this.

03:47.494 --> 03:50.896
If I can just get this sock on,
everything will be fine.

03:50.898 --> 03:52.931
(grunting)

03:52.933 --> 03:54.666
It's slow at work.

03:54.668 --> 03:57.069
The investment property is being
held up with inspections.

03:57.071 --> 04:00.439
I can just cover for you
until you're back on your feet.

04:00.441 --> 04:01.873
I don't think so.

04:01.875 --> 04:04.042
You and the staff
aren't exactly a good mix.

04:04.044 --> 04:06.945
You told Nancy she didn't
really serve in Desert Storm.

04:06.947 --> 04:09.047
She didn't get a kill.
She was a cook.

04:09.049 --> 04:12.050
Cooks should have
the most kills.

04:12.052 --> 04:14.333
They have
the element of surprise.

04:16.957 --> 04:18.624
(grunts)

04:18.626 --> 04:20.459
(sighs)

04:25.532 --> 04:28.867
If you were to cover for me,

04:28.869 --> 04:30.602
you couldn't fire anyone.

04:30.604 --> 04:32.771
What makes you think
I would fire anyone?

04:32.773 --> 04:34.539
Because that's your move.

04:34.541 --> 04:36.041
At the furniture store in D.C.,

04:36.043 --> 04:38.043
you would try to fire people
all the time.

04:38.045 --> 04:39.478
Name one.

04:39.480 --> 04:41.813
Me. Susan our accountant.
James my client.

04:41.815 --> 04:43.415
You tried to fire a customer.

04:43.417 --> 04:44.950
Being a manager
is a lot like chess.

04:44.952 --> 04:46.752
If you can't get rid
of any of the pieces,

04:46.754 --> 04:48.120
you can't win the game.

04:48.122 --> 04:50.222
No firing anyone. Fine.

04:50.224 --> 04:52.758
No firing...
except as a last resort.

04:52.760 --> 04:55.761
Nope. No firing. No verbal firings.
I understand.

04:55.763 --> 04:59.197
No firing. What if word of layoffs
comes down from corporate?

05:00.834 --> 05:02.401
Boys, your father is recovering,

05:02.403 --> 05:04.403
so I'm going to be
at the restaurant today

05:04.405 --> 05:06.238
and he'll be here
when you get home from school.

05:06.240 --> 05:07.506
Yay!

05:07.508 --> 05:08.774
Dad! (Chuckles)

05:08.776 --> 05:10.809
These truly are my lucky socks!

05:10.811 --> 05:14.079
My brain's going to school,
but my heart's staying here.

05:14.081 --> 05:15.601
My brain's staying here, too.

05:19.353 --> 05:21.753
As you know,
Louis had an accident.

05:21.755 --> 05:24.756
Oh, yeah. He paged me...
"911 Louis down".

05:24.758 --> 05:26.792
Was he attacked by birds?
They're everywhere.

05:26.794 --> 05:28.827
I think they're moving down here
from Vermont.

05:28.829 --> 05:30.262
I saw a bird in a tree,

05:30.264 --> 05:31.330
and I was like,
"Is he watching me?"

05:31.332 --> 05:32.964
It wasn't birds.

05:32.966 --> 05:36.435
Now, I know we've had
our differences in the past,

05:36.437 --> 05:38.804
but it's time for a fresh start.

05:38.806 --> 05:42.607
Together, we can make
the To-Go launch a success.

05:42.609 --> 05:44.676
You ever see a complete pigeon?

05:44.678 --> 05:46.278
They're always
missing something.

05:46.280 --> 05:48.780
Are you trying to get fired,
Nancy?

05:48.782 --> 05:50.549
Oh, we know
you can't fire anyone.

05:50.551 --> 05:52.451
Louis also paged me that.

05:53.387 --> 05:55.454
Fire won't kill a pigeon.

05:55.456 --> 05:58.023
I've seen them shuffling out
of burning buildings in Kuwait.

05:58.025 --> 06:00.185
It's like
they're born from the flames.

06:01.295 --> 06:02.828
¶¶

06:02.830 --> 06:03.962
(laughter)

06:03.964 --> 06:05.397
Hey, boys.

06:05.399 --> 06:06.898
Welcome home.

06:06.900 --> 06:08.734
(chuckles)

06:08.736 --> 06:11.837
I guess if I was forced to pick,
I'd eat Eddie.

06:11.839 --> 06:12.871
Me too.

06:12.873 --> 06:14.539
I'd eat Evan. Why me?

06:14.541 --> 06:15.907
I've known you a shorter time,

06:15.909 --> 06:17.209
so I'm less attached to you.

06:18.178 --> 06:20.212
Louis?

06:20.214 --> 06:21.346
(door closes)

06:21.348 --> 06:23.215
Where's your father?

06:23.217 --> 06:25.083
I agreed not to fire the staff,

06:25.085 --> 06:27.085
but they didn't need
to know that.

06:27.087 --> 06:29.688
Now they have nothing to fear!

06:29.690 --> 06:32.424
How can I rule without fear?!

06:33.827 --> 06:36.228
Do you want us to respond?

06:37.498 --> 06:39.030
Dad's at the diner
where Emery got sick

06:39.032 --> 06:40.732
from drinking
all that orange juice.

06:40.734 --> 06:42.934
He went to the diner? When?

06:42.936 --> 06:45.337
As soon as we got home
from school.

06:45.339 --> 06:47.339
He said, "Hey, boys.
Welcome home."

06:47.341 --> 06:48.707
Want some coffee?"

06:48.709 --> 06:50.275
And then he left
to get us all coffee.

06:50.277 --> 06:52.077
I'm waiting on a babyccino.

06:57.117 --> 06:58.550
Louis?

06:58.552 --> 07:00.585
Oh, thank God
you're back from work.

07:00.587 --> 07:01.787
Let's go home.

07:01.789 --> 07:03.054
What are you doing here?

07:03.056 --> 07:03.922
Why aren't you home
with the boys?

07:03.924 --> 07:05.323
Because you're not there.

07:06.527 --> 07:07.793
(sighs)

07:07.795 --> 07:10.529
I can't spend time alone
with our kids.

07:10.531 --> 07:12.764
Can I get a babyccino
and the check?

07:18.539 --> 07:19.938
What do you mean

07:19.940 --> 07:22.808
you can't spend time alone
with the kids?

07:22.810 --> 07:24.910
They love you.
You're their favorite.

07:24.912 --> 07:26.211
Yeah, that's because
I only see them

07:26.213 --> 07:27.479
for a little bit every night.

07:27.481 --> 07:29.080
I give them a tight-two.

07:29.082 --> 07:31.650
I blow in, dazzle them with
a two-minute tornado of fun,

07:31.652 --> 07:33.218
then get out.

07:33.220 --> 07:36.054
Okay, quick impression
of the Budweiser frogs,

07:36.056 --> 07:37.589
then pretend to fall down,

07:37.591 --> 07:39.424
then a fun fact
straight into a group tickle,

07:39.426 --> 07:42.494
ending with your closer...
Desirable food item.

07:42.496 --> 07:43.528
Phew!

07:45.165 --> 07:45.997
EVAN: Yay! EMERY: Dad's home!

07:45.999 --> 07:47.799
Bud... weis... er.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.234
(boys cheering) (laughs)

07:49.236 --> 07:51.236
Hit them hard
and leave them wanting more.

07:51.238 --> 07:52.604
Learned that from my father.

07:52.606 --> 07:54.172
I idolized him,

07:54.174 --> 07:56.741
and I saw him for like 10
minutes, total, my whole life.

07:56.743 --> 07:58.577
The more time
you spend with your kids,

07:58.579 --> 07:59.911
the more chances they have

07:59.913 --> 08:02.514
to realize you're just a guy,
a mortal,

08:02.516 --> 08:04.950
that your detachable thumb
isn't magic

08:04.952 --> 08:06.818
and those quarters aren't
coming out of their ears,

08:06.820 --> 08:08.253
they're coming
out of your paycheck.

08:08.255 --> 08:09.621
This is ridiculous.

08:09.623 --> 08:11.356
You spend a lot of time
with the boys.

08:11.358 --> 08:13.825
Yeah, but not alone.
You're always around.

08:13.827 --> 08:16.695
You're my buffer...
The bad cop to my good cop.

08:16.697 --> 08:18.697
Wait, I thought<i> I</i>
was the good cop...

08:18.699 --> 08:22.033
Enforcing rules so that they can
learn to live in society.

08:22.035 --> 08:23.502
You're the bad cop...

08:23.504 --> 08:25.637
Giving them treats
and then confusing them

08:25.639 --> 08:28.340
by making them think frogs
can say the name of a beer.

08:28.342 --> 08:29.641
You're right. I'm bad cop.

08:29.643 --> 08:31.109
You shouldn't leave me alone
with them.

08:31.111 --> 08:32.544
Nice try.

08:32.546 --> 08:34.045
Tomorrow, you're gonna
spend the whole day

08:34.047 --> 08:36.281
with the kids by yourself.

08:36.283 --> 08:38.416
(whining) But I'm sick.

08:39.620 --> 08:41.119
(country music plays)

08:41.121 --> 08:43.455
(indistinct conversation)

08:43.457 --> 08:46.057
What is this?
No standing around.

08:46.059 --> 08:47.492
Well, we're just waiting
for our orders to come out.

08:47.494 --> 08:49.327
You have time to lean,
you have time to clean.

08:49.329 --> 08:51.496
Come on.
ABM... always be moving.

08:51.498 --> 08:53.298
You got it, boss. (Chuckles)

08:56.737 --> 08:58.303
Really?

08:58.305 --> 09:01.172
What? You didn't say how fast
we had to be moving.

09:01.174 --> 09:05.977
(in slow-motion)
Ha, ha, ha. Good one.

09:05.979 --> 09:07.412
Thank you for waiting.

09:07.414 --> 09:09.047
Here's your Cattleman's To-Go.

09:09.049 --> 09:10.982
I'm sorry. Is there any way
we can eat it here?

09:10.984 --> 09:12.317
The kids changed their minds.

09:12.319 --> 09:13.718
Oh, yeah. Of course.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.680
There's plenty of tables.
Sit anywhere you like.

09:18.325 --> 09:19.925
Hey. I don't know
if you know this,

09:19.927 --> 09:21.493
we don't get tips
on those orders,

09:21.495 --> 09:22.894
so if you let them eat here,

09:22.896 --> 09:25.063
we'll have to clean up after
as if they dined in.

09:25.065 --> 09:26.865
All the work and no tip?

09:26.867 --> 09:28.400
Got it. I didn't know that.

09:28.402 --> 09:30.302
Great. Thanks.

09:36.009 --> 09:37.275
(exhales sharply)

09:37.277 --> 09:40.045
You can do this.
It's just a few hours.

09:40.047 --> 09:42.614
They are your sons.
You made them.

09:42.616 --> 09:44.950
It depends on what you value
on the island...

09:44.952 --> 09:47.786
Entertainment or strength.

09:47.788 --> 09:49.321
Eat me, you lose both.

09:50.357 --> 09:52.023
Dad.

09:52.025 --> 09:53.858
You're not gonna leave
to get coffee again, are you?

09:53.860 --> 09:55.193
Nope.
How about some Chris Farley?

09:55.195 --> 09:56.461
I'm Tommy Boy.

09:56.463 --> 09:58.196
"Fat guy in a little coat.

09:58.198 --> 09:59.731
Tommy likey. Tommy want wingy."

09:59.733 --> 10:01.433
Why did the fish
get a bad report card?

10:01.435 --> 10:03.034
Because all his grades were under sea!
(under "C")

10:03.036 --> 10:04.636
Fun fact... There are no
naturally occurring blue foods.

10:04.638 --> 10:06.137
Even blueberries are purple.

10:06.139 --> 10:07.872
Also, it's impossible to sneeze
with your eyes open.

10:07.874 --> 10:09.808
Ah-choo! See? Oreos?

10:09.810 --> 10:11.209
Dad, are you okay?

10:11.211 --> 10:13.044
You heard your mom.
Time for bed.

10:13.046 --> 10:14.746
Mom's not here.

10:14.748 --> 10:16.314
And it's the middle of the day.

10:16.316 --> 10:17.716
Uh... I-I know. I knew that.

10:17.718 --> 10:19.451
I was just seeing
if you knew that,

10:19.453 --> 10:21.286
and you passed the test like
school... homework... home test!

10:21.288 --> 10:23.054
(laughs nervously)

10:23.056 --> 10:24.723
<i>You're flailing.
You got nothing left.</i>

10:24.725 --> 10:26.057
<i>They're gonna realize
you're a fraud</i>

10:26.059 --> 10:27.258
<i>if you don't do something.</i>

10:27.260 --> 10:29.094
<i>Come on. Think. Think!</i>

10:29.096 --> 10:30.161
Let's watch TV!

10:34.501 --> 10:37.936
Grandma's watching her movies.

10:37.938 --> 10:39.571
Uh, it's okay.

10:39.573 --> 10:41.940
I'm sure she'll make
an exception for her baby boy.

10:41.942 --> 10:43.575
Hey, Ma?

10:43.577 --> 10:45.897
Would you mind if the boys and I
watched TV for a bit?

10:51.952 --> 10:54.619
Now what are we gonna do, Dad?

10:54.621 --> 10:55.854
Uh...

10:55.856 --> 10:57.789
we can watch this movie.
(chuckles)

10:57.791 --> 10:58.951
<i>This</i> movie?

11:00.761 --> 11:03.862
(deep voice) Look out, we're here
to buy my brother some sunglasses.

11:03.864 --> 11:05.196
(high-pitched voice) One minute.

11:05.198 --> 11:06.097
(deep voice)
One minute, little bro.

11:06.099 --> 11:07.766
Hi, my name is John Paul,

11:07.768 --> 11:09.968
but my friends
call me Disco Dave.

11:09.970 --> 11:11.870
You guys got a great place here.

11:11.872 --> 11:13.104
Well-built.

11:13.106 --> 11:14.773
You can tell
the beams are solid.

11:14.775 --> 11:16.207
I'm not getting sunglasses,

11:16.209 --> 11:18.109
because I just bought
this awesome watch.

11:18.111 --> 11:20.351
(high-pitched voice)
I have a watch, but it's old.

11:22.049 --> 11:24.983
(deep voice) Well, I'll be.
Girls.

11:24.985 --> 11:26.184
(high-pitched sigh)

11:26.186 --> 11:28.019
Don't look now. There's Paul.

11:28.021 --> 11:30.221
(deep voice) You ladies
buying me a present?

11:30.223 --> 11:32.323
(high-pitched voice) Yeah, we're
trying to buy you a life.

11:32.325 --> 11:34.325
(giggles) Good one, Anne.

11:34.327 --> 11:36.461
(normal voice)
Hey, cool sunglasses, dude.

11:36.463 --> 11:38.296
Yeah, super cool. (Chuckles)

11:38.298 --> 11:39.464
He looks like my uncle.

11:39.466 --> 11:41.066
(chuckles)

11:47.307 --> 11:49.307
Can we draw on your cast?

11:49.309 --> 11:52.477
Uh, sure! (Chuckles)

11:52.479 --> 11:54.479
Yes, you can draw
whatever you want.

11:54.481 --> 11:55.313
Really?

11:55.315 --> 11:56.481
Well, no butts.

11:56.483 --> 11:57.982
(all groan)

11:57.984 --> 11:59.084
Okay... butts.

11:59.086 --> 12:00.318
ALL: Yay!

12:00.320 --> 12:01.553
I call the black marker!

12:01.555 --> 12:03.455
(exhales sharply)

12:04.825 --> 12:06.257
Table for two, please.

12:06.259 --> 12:08.026
May I suggest
instead of ordering

12:08.028 --> 12:09.594
from the menu at your table,

12:09.596 --> 12:12.330
you call in an order
and then just eat it here?

12:12.332 --> 12:14.499
That way,
you don't have to pay a tip.

12:14.501 --> 12:16.534
It's all part
of our new service...

12:16.536 --> 12:19.037
Cattleman's To-Go To Stay.

12:19.039 --> 12:20.905
Saving money!

12:20.907 --> 12:22.107
(laughs)

12:22.109 --> 12:24.609
I like the sound of that.
(laughs)

12:24.611 --> 12:26.811
Speed dial. Line one.

12:27.180 --> 12:28.880
(telephone beeps) (grunts)

12:28.882 --> 12:30.415
(telephone rings)

12:30.417 --> 12:31.583
Cattleman's Ranch.

12:31.585 --> 12:33.251
Uh, hi.

12:33.253 --> 12:35.887
I'll have the hickory burger
and some curly fries.

12:35.889 --> 12:37.255
Excellent choice. (Chuckles)

12:37.257 --> 12:38.790
My wife would like
the club sandwich...

12:38.792 --> 12:41.259
I want to switch
to the steak salad.

12:41.261 --> 12:43.128
Hold on a second.

12:43.130 --> 12:44.362
What do you want, now?

12:44.364 --> 12:46.798
I want a steak salad,
no dressing.

12:46.800 --> 12:48.466
You don't want the club sandwich
anymore?

12:48.468 --> 12:49.634
You sure?

12:49.636 --> 12:51.556
'Cause I got them
on the phone now.

12:53.406 --> 12:57.208
She'd like the steak salad,
no sauce.

12:57.210 --> 12:58.943
No sauce.

13:00.580 --> 13:04.149
¶¶

13:05.585 --> 13:07.919
<i>Dear God. They're almost done.</i>

13:07.921 --> 13:09.921
<i>When did they learn
to draw so fast?</i>

13:09.923 --> 13:12.090
Dad, if we were stuck
on an island,

13:12.092 --> 13:14.125
which one of us would you eat?
Eddie.

13:14.127 --> 13:17.061
Why wouldn't you pick me?
I'm young, like veal.

13:17.063 --> 13:18.296
I thought you didn't want
to get eaten.

13:18.298 --> 13:19.564
Not by you.

13:19.566 --> 13:22.400
But Dad?
I'd be honored if he ate me.

13:23.737 --> 13:25.670
Well, I guess that's it.
We're out of space.

13:25.672 --> 13:26.971
Already?

13:26.973 --> 13:29.641
Dad, are you okay?
You're sweating.

13:29.643 --> 13:31.142
(stammers) Uh, yeah.

13:31.144 --> 13:33.077
(chuckles) It's just this cast.

13:33.079 --> 13:35.079
It's itchy, probably got a rash.

13:35.081 --> 13:37.715
ALL: Gross.

13:39.252 --> 13:41.252
(country music plays)

13:43.156 --> 13:46.024
That order was called in
over an hour ago.

13:46.026 --> 13:47.525
Nobody's come to pick it up yet?

13:47.527 --> 13:49.594
Guess not.

13:49.596 --> 13:51.196
Why would somebody
call in an order

13:51.198 --> 13:52.764
and then not pick it up?

13:52.766 --> 13:54.165
I don't know.

13:54.167 --> 13:56.034
Pfft, a lot of forgetful people
out there.

13:56.036 --> 13:58.970
Right. Forgetful.

13:58.972 --> 14:00.672
Calling in fake orders?

14:00.674 --> 14:02.941
Making us waste food
and lose money.

14:02.943 --> 14:03.775
(chuckles nervously)

14:03.777 --> 14:05.276
(telephone rings)

14:05.278 --> 14:07.645
Cattleman's Ranch To-Go.
MAN: Yes, hello.

14:07.647 --> 14:10.849
I'd like to place an order
for a To-Go To Stay.

14:10.851 --> 14:13.384
Oh, you would, would you?

14:13.386 --> 14:14.886
It's for my T-ball team.

14:14.888 --> 14:17.188
They're what
you'd call "big boys."

14:17.190 --> 14:18.656
(chuckles)

14:18.658 --> 14:20.892
Well,
I've got my pen right here.

14:20.894 --> 14:22.460
I'm ready when you are.

14:22.462 --> 14:24.295
We'll take
20 double cheeseburgers...

14:24.297 --> 14:25.230
Mm-hmm.

14:25.232 --> 14:26.798
15 hot dogs... Yep.

14:26.800 --> 14:28.533
15 chili fries... Yeah.

14:28.535 --> 14:31.903
And all the ice cream sundaes you got.
Sounds good.

14:31.905 --> 14:34.305
I know it's you, Mitch!

14:34.307 --> 14:35.840
(gruffly) "T-ball burgers."

14:35.842 --> 14:38.910
Nice try, okay? Nice try.

14:38.912 --> 14:40.312
It's not me. I'm right here.

14:41.581 --> 14:43.715
I think you just blew
a huge order.

14:43.717 --> 14:46.451
¶¶

14:47.587 --> 14:50.088
(sighs) Louis, your staff is...

14:50.090 --> 14:52.757
Hey, honey. How was your day?

14:52.759 --> 14:54.325
How was your drive home?

14:54.327 --> 14:56.327
Did they fill in that pothole
over on 5th Avenue?

14:56.329 --> 14:57.328
I sure hope so.

14:57.330 --> 14:58.930
What's going on?

14:58.932 --> 15:00.265
Nothing. I'm just happy.

15:00.267 --> 15:01.666
(laughs)

15:01.668 --> 15:04.168
Hey, how's To-Go going?
Is it taking off?

15:04.170 --> 15:05.503
N... (gasps)

15:05.505 --> 15:06.604
Oh!

15:06.606 --> 15:08.539
What happened to your cast?

15:08.541 --> 15:10.041
I let the boys cut it off.
(chuckles)

15:10.043 --> 15:11.943
Who says I'm not a fun dad? Oh.

15:11.945 --> 15:13.878
Can you put the blanket back?
Wind is hurting my leg.

15:13.880 --> 15:15.280
(chuckles)

15:20.253 --> 15:23.354
(scoffs) What is taking so long?

15:23.356 --> 15:25.556
We wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for you.

15:25.558 --> 15:27.759
You're still in shock
from the pain

15:27.761 --> 15:29.227
if you think this is my fault.

15:29.229 --> 15:32.196
You forced me to spend hours
alone with our kids.

15:32.198 --> 15:35.066
That doesn't mean you let them
cut off your cast.

15:35.068 --> 15:36.935
I had to keep them entertained.

15:36.937 --> 15:39.904
I did my Chris Farley,
Grandma was watching a movie.

15:39.906 --> 15:41.239
It was the only choice.

15:41.241 --> 15:43.522
Where does this end, Louis?

15:44.444 --> 15:46.878
I'm gonna find the doctor.

15:48.715 --> 15:51.749
Excuse me. How long
until you can see my husband?

15:51.751 --> 15:53.084
We're pretty backed up.

15:53.086 --> 15:54.585
I'm gonna guess
a good six hours.

15:54.587 --> 15:56.287
Six hours?

15:56.289 --> 15:57.622
We don't normally take people

15:57.624 --> 15:59.057
who let their children
cut their cast off

15:59.059 --> 16:00.425
because they were afraid
of boring them

16:00.427 --> 16:02.226
and move them
to the top of the list.

16:02.228 --> 16:03.594
Well, he's at least ahead

16:03.596 --> 16:05.796
of that girl
with the stomach thing, right?

16:07.100 --> 16:08.466
(whining) My stomach!

16:08.468 --> 16:10.335
(scoffs) She's faking.

16:10.337 --> 16:12.437
If you'll excuse me,
I have to get back

16:12.439 --> 16:15.039
to the patients with serious,
life-and-death problems.

16:18.979 --> 16:19.944
(sighs)

16:19.946 --> 16:21.846
Where are the boys?

16:21.848 --> 16:23.448
They were looking bored,

16:23.450 --> 16:25.750
so I panicked and gave them
$50 for the vending machine.

16:28.088 --> 16:30.455
Listen, Louis.

16:30.457 --> 16:33.124
The doctor was talking about
life and death,

16:33.126 --> 16:35.593
and it made me think.

16:35.595 --> 16:38.096
We've never had the talk,

16:38.098 --> 16:39.831
if something
were to happen to you.

16:39.833 --> 16:41.933
Jessica,
I'm only getting my leg re-cast.

16:41.935 --> 16:44.502
I know, I know,
but it scared me.

16:45.438 --> 16:47.872
Crazy things happen every day.

16:47.874 --> 16:49.640
One second, you're here,
the next...

16:49.642 --> 16:51.209
It could happen at any moment.

16:51.211 --> 16:54.145
I never really thought about it,
but I guess that's true.

16:54.147 --> 16:56.647
It's horrible to think about,

16:56.649 --> 16:58.850
but God forbid
you should leave us.

16:58.852 --> 17:00.985
My boys. My family.

17:00.987 --> 17:05.023
And I would be left
to manage on my own...

17:05.025 --> 17:08.459
without the ability to fire
anyone at the restaurant.

17:08.461 --> 17:09.727
What?

17:09.729 --> 17:12.497
Is... Is that what... No!
No firings!

17:12.499 --> 17:13.998
(scoffs) Fine.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.566
Well, if you're not gonna
let me fire them,

17:15.568 --> 17:17.035
then you should.

17:17.037 --> 17:19.303
Louis, they're lazy,
insubordinate.

17:19.305 --> 17:22.407
They don't care about
our business.

17:22.409 --> 17:24.242
They're worse than goldfish,
Louis.

17:24.244 --> 17:25.743
They're catfish.

17:25.745 --> 17:27.879
They're the garbagemen
of the lake.

17:27.881 --> 17:30.681
Wait. Where are you going?
You can't leave me alone.

17:30.683 --> 17:33.618
Spend time with your kids.

17:34.888 --> 17:36.020
(sighs)

17:36.022 --> 17:38.056
(country music plays)

17:38.058 --> 17:40.158
(children's laughter)

17:43.096 --> 17:45.563
The big boys.

17:45.565 --> 17:46.597
They're real. (Fork snaps)

17:46.599 --> 17:48.032
I broke another fork.

17:48.034 --> 17:49.000
New one coming up.

17:49.002 --> 17:50.168
This pepper's out.

17:50.170 --> 17:51.335
I'll refill it right away.

17:51.337 --> 17:52.470
Here you go.

17:54.174 --> 17:55.206
Mitts!

17:55.208 --> 17:56.541
(laughter)

17:56.543 --> 17:57.942
Uh, no problem.
I'll clean that up.

17:57.944 --> 17:59.710
Mitch. What's going on?

17:59.712 --> 18:01.245
The T-ball team who called in
their to-go order...

18:01.247 --> 18:03.214
They showed up wanting
their food, so we scrambled.

18:03.216 --> 18:05.550
You could've just told them
I never wrote down their order.

18:05.552 --> 18:07.718
Yeah, but it's a huge order
for the restaurant.

18:07.720 --> 18:09.053
Plus, it's our job.

18:09.055 --> 18:10.188
I need you back out there,
Mitch.

18:10.190 --> 18:11.622
I'm drowning in cobs!

18:14.027 --> 18:15.526
Excuse me. Are you the coach?

18:15.528 --> 18:18.796
I guess. But, hell,
they teach me a lot, too.

18:18.798 --> 18:20.965
I'm glad
you're enjoying your food.

18:20.967 --> 18:23.968
As you can see, our staff worked
really hard for you today,

18:23.970 --> 18:26.237
so it'd be nice
if you could leave them a tip.

18:26.239 --> 18:30.441
No. We ordered To-Go To Stay so
we wouldn't have to leave a tip.

18:30.443 --> 18:32.910
I understand,
but this is a huge party.

18:32.912 --> 18:34.645
That's why we're undefeated.

18:34.647 --> 18:38.382
Speaking of which, we got to go.
We got a game in 10 minutes.

18:38.384 --> 18:41.252
Woof down those sundaes,
and grab your bats, boys.

18:41.254 --> 18:44.956
(indistinct conversation)

18:44.958 --> 18:48.759
So, they eat like this
and then they go play?

18:48.761 --> 18:49.727
To be young, right?

18:49.729 --> 18:51.829
(scoffs) Yeah, right.

18:51.831 --> 18:54.398
- What's this?
- It's your tip.

18:54.400 --> 18:55.766
But they didn't leave one.

18:55.768 --> 18:58.402
It's on me.
To-Go To Stay is done.

18:58.404 --> 19:00.071
Really?

19:00.073 --> 19:01.939
Well, it was my mistake
for not taking their order,

19:01.941 --> 19:04.675
and I appreciate you stepping up
and doing a good job.

19:05.645 --> 19:07.478
You're not goldfish...

19:07.480 --> 19:09.013
or catfish.

19:09.015 --> 19:11.349
Thank you.

19:11.351 --> 19:13.618
T-T-That's really nice of you
to say.

19:13.620 --> 19:16.420
You know, it is customary
to tip at least 10%.

19:16.422 --> 19:17.288
Don't push it.

19:17.290 --> 19:20.158
¶¶

19:22.695 --> 19:24.862
EDDIE: Sorry we took so long.

19:24.864 --> 19:26.264
We cleaned out
these vending machines,

19:26.266 --> 19:27.798
so we had to go up
to the fourth floor.

19:27.800 --> 19:29.300
This is actually
the sixth floor,

19:29.302 --> 19:31.536
so we went<i> down</i>
to the fourth floor.

19:31.538 --> 19:34.338
Congratulations.
You win directions.

19:34.340 --> 19:35.506
It's over.

19:35.508 --> 19:37.041
What is?

19:37.043 --> 19:39.143
This whole thing. I'm done.

19:39.145 --> 19:40.478
Your mother's gone.

19:40.480 --> 19:42.046
We're stuck here
for another five hours.

19:42.048 --> 19:45.049
I have no cast to cut off,
no impressions to do,

19:45.051 --> 19:46.217
no coffee to get.

19:46.219 --> 19:49.287
My leg's broken.
I'm a real mess.

19:49.289 --> 19:50.988
(sighs)

19:50.990 --> 19:53.124
I am not a fun dad.

19:53.126 --> 19:54.125
What?

19:54.127 --> 19:55.893
It's all an illusion.

19:55.895 --> 19:57.195
Every night, I come home,

19:57.197 --> 19:58.829
do two minutes
of smoke and mirrors

19:58.831 --> 20:01.332
to make you think I'm funny
and cool and interesting,

20:01.334 --> 20:05.336
but the truth is, I'm not.

20:05.338 --> 20:07.738
Okay.

20:07.740 --> 20:09.640
Okay?

20:09.642 --> 20:11.909
Yeah. We're cool
with just chilling out.

20:11.911 --> 20:13.744
I mean, we love your energy,

20:13.746 --> 20:15.713
but we don't have to do it
every night.

20:15.715 --> 20:19.383
Honestly,
sometimes it's a bit much.

20:19.385 --> 20:21.819
My tight-two?
You love my tight-two.

20:21.821 --> 20:23.054
Mm...

20:23.056 --> 20:25.823
Sometimes it could be
a tight-one.

20:25.825 --> 20:29.927
So we can just... sit here?

20:29.929 --> 20:32.089
Yeah. Fine with us.

20:34.200 --> 20:35.566
And you're not gonna get bored?

20:35.568 --> 20:37.101
You don't need me
to entertain you?

20:37.103 --> 20:39.170
No. You're our dad.

20:39.172 --> 20:41.652
We just like it
when you're around.

20:44.277 --> 20:46.510
I'd let you guys eat me.

20:46.512 --> 20:48.079
Thanks, dude.

20:48.081 --> 20:50.681
Guys, your mom would
immediately cook and eat us all.

20:50.683 --> 20:51.515
Oh.

20:51.517 --> 20:53.597
Yeah. Yeah.

20:57.290 --> 20:59.090
(saw whirring)

21:02.595 --> 21:04.629
So happy to have this thing off

21:04.631 --> 21:06.464
(chuckles) Again.
DR. MELLANBY: Yep.

21:06.466 --> 21:08.733
Despite the initial setback,

21:08.735 --> 21:12.136
the X-rays show
that the leg healed nicely.

21:12.138 --> 21:15.606
Everything looks great,
as you can see.

21:15.608 --> 21:16.874
(screams)

21:16.876 --> 21:18.476
You call this fixed?

21:18.478 --> 21:20.378
Why is it all withered?

21:20.380 --> 21:22.613
The muscle mass
will eventually rebuild.

21:22.615 --> 21:25.583
I had a man's leg.
This is a baby leg.

21:25.585 --> 21:28.319
I don't want a baby's leg!
Where is my leg?!

21:28.321 --> 21:30.988
Doesn't smell like a baby leg.
