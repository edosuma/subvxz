{\an1}[LAUGHING]

19:59.398 --> 20:01.066
ONLY 5 MORE MINUTES
UNTIL COSMO AND WANDA

HAVE TO BE ME!

20:08.807 --> 20:10.409
[TICKING]

20:11.743 --> 20:14.179
I'M GLAD THERE'S ONLY
10 MORE SECONDS LEFT

20:14.246 --> 20:15.948
UNTIL MAMA'S 9-HOUR FLU
IS OVER.

20:16.014 --> 20:19.451
{\an1}WELL...THAT WAS NICE
WHILE IT LASTED.

20:19.518 --> 20:21.320
OH, WHAT LOVELY SOUP.

20:21.386 --> 20:23.589
I'LL BET YOU COOKED IT,
DIDN'T YOU, WANDA?

20:23.655 --> 20:26.325
YOU'RE SO TALENTED
IN ALL THAT YOU DO.

20:26.391 --> 20:28.293
5...4...

20:28.360 --> 20:31.597
IT SMELLS DELICIOUS.
IT SMELLS LIKE LOVE.

THE GREATEST...

20:39.438 --> 20:42.507
DISAPPOINTMENT
OF MY LIFE!

20:42.574 --> 20:44.009
HOORAY!

20:44.076 --> 20:45.210
HOW MY DARLING BOY

20:45.277 --> 20:47.613
COULD MARRY A COMPLETE
LET-DOWN LIKE YOURSELF

20:47.679 --> 20:49.448
IS BEYOND ME.

20:49.514 --> 20:51.550
SHE'S FINE. WE'RE GONE.

20:51.617 --> 20:54.486

20:56.855 --> 20:58.523
HMM. THE TRASH IS OUT,

20:58.590 --> 21:00.759
{\an1}AND THERE ARE NO FAIRIES
IN THE BACKYARD OR KITCHEN.

21:00.826 --> 21:02.794
{\an1}COULD I GO LOOK FOR
FAIRIES IN MY ROOM NOW?

21:02.861 --> 21:05.998
{\an5}NO. NOT UNTIL
YOU'RE DONE WITH
YOUR HOMEWORK.

21:06.064 --> 21:08.634
{\an1}CURSE ME FOR GIVING ME
SO MUCH HOMEWORK!

21:09.901 --> 21:12.270
{\an1}UH...WHY ARE YOU
GIVING YOURSELF AN "F"?

21:12.337 --> 21:13.739
SORRY. FORCE OF HABIT.

21:13.805 --> 21:14.873
[DOORBELL RINGING]

21:16.041 --> 21:18.043
HEY, I THOUGHT
I TOLD YOU TO--

21:21.213 --> 21:24.616
{\an5}STAY OUTSIDE WHILE
I QUICKLY RUN UPSTAIRS
TO MY SON'S ROOM.

21:24.683 --> 21:27.853
{\an1}HMM. NARROW HIPS, HUNCH

21:29.721 --> 21:31.156
I'M GORGEOUS!

21:32.991 --> 21:34.593
WELL, TIME
TO GO HAVE FUN

21:34.660 --> 21:37.763
WITH THE MAN I MARRIED
WHOM I'D KNOW ANYWHERE.

21:37.829 --> 21:40.666
EEH!

WATER.

21:43.001 --> 21:45.604
WHOA! THAT'S WEIRD.

21:45.671 --> 21:48.073
I FEEL AS THOUGH I'VE
GIVEN UP ON MY DREAMS.

21:51.576 --> 21:54.446
EVERYTHING'S UNDER
CONTROL, MRS. TURNER.

21:54.513 --> 21:55.647
YOU GO HAVE FUN

21:55.714 --> 21:57.349
WHILE I FIRE UP
THE WOOD CHIPPER--

21:57.416 --> 21:59.484
I MEAN TURN ON THE TV.

22:02.554 --> 22:04.690
I'M GONNA NEED A BATH
AFTER THIS ONE.

22:04.756 --> 22:06.725
AAH! I FEEL OLD!

22:31.316 --> 22:33.351
WHERE ARE THE FAIRIES?

22:34.586 --> 22:36.188
AH, I NEVER COULD
RESIST

AS POSSIBLE.

23:02.481 --> 23:04.983
I KNOW. I'VE GOT A LOT
OF EXPLAINING TO DO,
