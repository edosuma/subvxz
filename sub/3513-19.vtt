WEBVTT

00:48.515 --> 00:50.085
I told you to meet me, not eat me.

00:52.519 --> 00:54.829
Hey, man. We're not playing
paintball out here, okay?

00:54.888 --> 00:56.595
You want to practice
your Grimm skills?

00:56.656 --> 00:57.896
You've got to be
ready for anything.

00:58.892 --> 00:59.962
Now, could you get off me, please?

01:00.026 --> 01:01.767
I'm finding this a little,
you know, awkward.

01:03.897 --> 01:05.171
Come on.

01:07.567 --> 01:10.104
And I told you to use wolfsbane, dude.
I could smell you a mile off.

01:10.170 --> 01:11.649
I used wolfsbane.

01:12.572 --> 01:14.313
Use more.

01:14.874 --> 01:16.251
Oh, my God.

01:16.509 --> 01:17.681
Monroe, easy. Come on.

01:17.744 --> 01:19.451
A Doppelarmbrust.

01:20.080 --> 01:22.026
Somebody's getting serious.

01:22.082 --> 01:24.187
My ancestors used
all of this stuff.

01:24.451 --> 01:26.124
You know, I figured it's about
time for me to learn it.

01:26.352 --> 01:27.729
Dude. You have a gun.

01:27.787 --> 01:29.767
I can't shoot everybody.

01:30.023 --> 01:32.435
Plus, I used pepper spray
on this kid the other day.

01:32.492 --> 01:34.904
Turns out he was a Skalengeck.
Had no effect.

01:34.961 --> 01:37.305
Skalengeck. He probably enjoyed it.

01:37.363 --> 01:39.001
Yeah, this definitely
would have done the trick.

01:39.065 --> 01:41.102
But how are you going to
explain all this stuff to Hank?

01:41.868 --> 01:43.870
I don't know. Check it out.

01:44.270 --> 01:47.376
The first bolt is meant
to slow the attacker down.

01:48.141 --> 01:50.678
You fill it with
hellebore extract. Yeah.

01:50.743 --> 01:53.280
According to the book, that's supposed
to act like a tranquilizer gun.

01:53.346 --> 01:56.293
And if that doesn't work,
you always have the second bolt.

01:56.349 --> 01:58.454
Filled with hemlock.

02:01.054 --> 02:03.967
You know these were designed
specifically to stop Blutbaden?

02:04.023 --> 02:05.366
Hmm.

02:06.860 --> 02:10.830
I suppose I should take that as sort
of a backhanded compliment, huh?

02:12.499 --> 02:13.944
Let's give it a try.

02:14.400 --> 02:16.846
Slowly squeeze...

02:17.303 --> 02:19.112
I know how to shoot.

02:25.879 --> 02:27.358
Not bad. Now.

02:29.482 --> 02:30.722
Anyone for some kanabo?

02:39.926 --> 02:42.566
Dude. Out of the park.

03:00.647 --> 03:02.092
You're running a
little late, Robert.

03:04.250 --> 03:05.820
Uh, yeah. Sorry, Sal.

03:06.386 --> 03:07.888
Got the money?

03:08.755 --> 03:13.431
Look. Sal, I've thought a
lot about our conversation.

03:13.593 --> 03:16.073
And I've made a decision.

03:19.566 --> 03:20.738
I'm not going to pay.

03:21.601 --> 03:24.104
You think you're being brave,
but you're not, Robert.

03:25.038 --> 03:27.245
You're being stupid and reckless.

03:27.640 --> 03:31.452
Now, I understand you have
to protect your interests.

03:32.679 --> 03:35.751
The thing is,
I have to protect mine.

03:37.984 --> 03:40.430
I'm going to the district attorney.

03:40.486 --> 03:41.897
And there's nothing
you can do to stop me.

03:43.990 --> 03:47.028
You seem like a man who likes
to bury himself in his work.

03:47.727 --> 03:50.173
Let's see if I can't
help you do that.

03:57.036 --> 04:00.040
Yeah. Yeah, I checked the rebar.
I'm just wrapping up.

04:00.306 --> 04:02.149
Hey, will you save me a
couple of slices and a...

04:02.208 --> 04:04.916
And a few cold ones? I don't know.
Like, 10 minutes.

04:05.778 --> 04:07.348
Hey. Hey, I'll... Look,
I'll be there.

04:07.413 --> 04:09.017
Okay, I'll be there.
All right, bye.

04:14.153 --> 04:15.291
No!

04:24.297 --> 04:25.867
No, no.

04:33.406 --> 04:34.942
911, what's your emergency?

04:35.008 --> 04:36.578
Yeah. You've got...
You've got to come quick.

04:36.643 --> 04:38.884
The construction site off of 99 E.

04:38.945 --> 04:40.219
Under the Gladstone Bridge.

04:41.047 --> 04:43.254
Oh, my God, he killed him.

04:43.316 --> 04:45.421
What's your name,
please? He killed him.

04:45.485 --> 04:50.264
Oh, my God.
My name? My name is, uh...

04:50.590 --> 04:52.297
Uh, my name is...

05:45.878 --> 05:49.519
ANNOUNCER ON TV: There are
bound to be slips and rips

05:49.582 --> 05:52.461
when wet boots dance
on slippery logs.

05:52.552 --> 05:54.327
But the work goes on and on,

05:54.387 --> 05:56.424
and the logs roll on and on...

06:48.341 --> 06:51.117
Arnold! What are you doing here?

06:52.812 --> 06:54.621
I saw something terrible.

06:55.915 --> 06:58.657
What? What did you see?

07:22.208 --> 07:23.414
Hey.

07:23.509 --> 07:25.386
We didn't get a name
from the 911 call,

07:25.445 --> 07:27.584
but whoever it was,
saw the whole thing go down.

07:27.647 --> 07:29.092
Did we ID our vic?

07:29.148 --> 07:31.992
According to the wallet,
Robert Grosszahn.

07:32.919 --> 07:34.899
Not that the picture helps much.

07:36.355 --> 07:39.529
Whoa! Now, that's some
old-school mob stuff.

07:44.530 --> 07:45.770
Yeah, this is Detective Burkhardt.

07:45.832 --> 07:48.779
We're gonna need an
ID on the 911 caller.

07:48.835 --> 07:51.406
Yeah, the witness at the Gladstone
Bridge construction site. Thank you.

07:52.205 --> 07:54.549
Robert Grosszahn as in
Grosszahn Constructions?

07:55.107 --> 07:56.609
They're a pretty big operation.

07:56.776 --> 08:00.155
I'm guessing that's his truck.
Let's take a look.

08:07.053 --> 08:10.762
Let's check his calendar.
He may have had a late appointment.

08:12.992 --> 08:14.835
Yeah.

08:17.630 --> 08:18.973
Thank you.

08:19.398 --> 08:22.072
Dispatch just lD'ed our
witness Arnold Rosarot.

08:22.134 --> 08:23.738
3863 Woodland Road.

08:23.803 --> 08:25.612
Well, let's check it out.

08:36.082 --> 08:38.062
It doesn't look like he's home.

08:42.955 --> 08:43.956
Unlocked.

08:44.155 --> 08:46.602
Yeah. Missing witness to a murder?

08:46.659 --> 08:48.866
Exigent circumstances
to any judge I know.

08:49.128 --> 08:50.266
Mmm.

08:51.264 --> 08:52.743
Hello?

09:01.207 --> 09:03.619
Man loved himself some whirligigs.

09:04.744 --> 09:06.587
Nice work. Yeah, nice.

09:06.946 --> 09:08.289
But weird.

09:15.621 --> 09:17.396
None of us have ever
seen a Grimm before.

09:17.623 --> 09:19.102
Where's the beer? You.

09:20.126 --> 09:21.196
Oh, my God.

09:40.413 --> 09:41.517
Who's Eisbiber?

09:42.114 --> 09:43.752
That's a possible witness.

09:43.816 --> 09:46.126
You know what I would like to do?

09:47.553 --> 09:48.725
I think so.

09:48.788 --> 09:50.927
I should probably shower first.
I'm a little bit cement-y.

09:51.457 --> 09:55.098
No. I would like to invite your friend,
Monroe, over for dinner.

09:56.395 --> 09:57.669
Oh. Uh...

09:58.698 --> 10:01.372
Yeah, that's a good idea.
But you know...

10:02.768 --> 10:04.179
We're not...

10:05.304 --> 10:06.476
He's not really a...

10:06.606 --> 10:09.553
He did save my life.
I think it would be a nice gesture.

10:09.609 --> 10:11.145
Come on. What does he
like to eat? I don't know.

10:11.477 --> 10:13.718
Honey, Monroe's really
not a dinner kind of guy.

10:13.980 --> 10:16.153
He's a loner. I think
he'll be uncomfortable.

10:16.649 --> 10:18.390
Well, why don't you just ask him?

10:18.451 --> 10:20.260
And if he says no,
I'll think of something else.

10:20.319 --> 10:21.957
A picnic, maybe.

10:22.021 --> 10:23.261
Please.

10:26.025 --> 10:27.868
It's worth a try. I guess.

10:28.127 --> 10:29.265
Good.

10:30.796 --> 10:32.605
Ew. Cement-y.

10:38.738 --> 10:39.910
So, what would you have us do?

10:39.972 --> 10:42.145
I don't know. Just...
Just say you're sick.

10:42.208 --> 10:43.949
That works for one night.
Then what?

10:44.010 --> 10:46.320
Besides, that would
be totally rude of me.

10:46.379 --> 10:47.585
I think it's a very nice offer.

10:47.647 --> 10:48.682
Monroe.

10:48.748 --> 10:50.125
Think about this for one second.

10:50.182 --> 10:52.253
What would we possibly talk about?

10:53.185 --> 10:54.994
"Oh, gee, guys,
how did you two meet?"

10:55.054 --> 10:58.263
"Well, honey, it all started when
I found out Monroe was a Blutbad,

10:58.324 --> 11:00.895
"and that was right after
I found out I was a Grimm.

11:00.960 --> 11:02.132
"And by the way, did I tell you

11:02.194 --> 11:03.502
"that I can see things
other people can't?"

11:03.562 --> 11:06.668
Okay. Okay. So, technically,
we would have to

11:07.466 --> 11:09.139
bend the truth about some things.

11:09.201 --> 11:11.738
Some things? Monroe,
name one aspect of our relationship

11:11.804 --> 11:12.874
that we wouldn't have to lie about.

11:14.940 --> 11:16.419
You're right.

11:17.343 --> 11:19.254
All the time we've spent together.

11:19.311 --> 11:21.313
All the sneaking around.

11:22.715 --> 11:25.321
God, suddenly,
it just seems so wrong.

11:27.153 --> 11:28.359
She's a really good cook,
isn't she?

11:28.421 --> 11:29.559
Yeah, she's fantastic.

11:29.622 --> 11:32.933
Monroe, please stop thinking
about food for a second.

11:35.194 --> 11:38.334
Okay, look. The only way
we do anything like this,

11:39.432 --> 11:41.434
is if we agree on a story.

11:42.001 --> 11:43.912
We keep it simple,
and then, we stick to it.

11:44.136 --> 11:46.013
Yep. Simple story, stick to it.

11:46.072 --> 11:47.107
Okay.

11:47.873 --> 11:49.580
So, how did we meet?

11:51.277 --> 11:52.483
Well,

11:53.279 --> 11:56.920
in my experience, the best
lies are sort of the truth.

12:01.220 --> 12:02.995
Was he having any problems
with the business?

12:03.055 --> 12:06.434
No. I mean, it was a stressful job.

12:06.992 --> 12:10.371
And he was doing battle with
the Planning Commission.

12:10.963 --> 12:13.569
I worked with him
for almost 10 years.

12:14.200 --> 12:17.306
He was like a father to me.
To everyone here, really.

12:18.170 --> 12:21.117
Well, what kind of battle was he
doing with the Planning Commission?

12:21.574 --> 12:24.885
Inspections, permits,
code compliance. It never ends.

12:25.311 --> 12:27.917
There was something scheduled in
his cell phone calendar for 9:30?

12:28.180 --> 12:29.352
Well, I didn't know
anything about it,

12:29.415 --> 12:30.655
and I schedule all his meetings.

12:30.916 --> 12:33.226
The initials "S.B.
" were next to the time.

12:33.552 --> 12:35.429
Does that mean anything to you?

12:35.488 --> 12:36.558
No.

12:37.790 --> 12:40.202
Who was he having trouble with
at the Planning Commission?

12:41.093 --> 12:42.595
That would be Mr. Butrell.

12:53.339 --> 12:55.012
I'm Detective Burkhardt.

12:55.074 --> 12:56.280
I'm Detective Griffin.

12:56.342 --> 12:58.049
Sit. Sit down.

12:59.845 --> 13:02.451
I was really sorry to hear
about what happened to Robert.

13:03.015 --> 13:04.426
How can I help?

13:04.483 --> 13:05.985
We just have a couple of questions.

13:06.051 --> 13:07.359
Sure. Of course.

13:07.419 --> 13:10.059
How well did you know
Robert Grosszahn?

13:10.122 --> 13:11.624
Oh, we've done

13:11.690 --> 13:13.294
a few projects over the years.

13:13.359 --> 13:15.737
But I've never gone to
his house for dinner,

13:15.795 --> 13:16.899
if that's what
you're talking about.

13:17.596 --> 13:19.269
And where were you
last night at 9:30?

13:20.800 --> 13:24.714
Um... The Trip Trap
Club down on Chauncey.

13:25.704 --> 13:29.015
Me and the guys, we have a poker
night there every Wednesday.

13:29.408 --> 13:30.978
You have someone who can
vouch for you on that?

13:31.310 --> 13:34.348
Only six or so. I hope you
don't need any more than that.

13:39.585 --> 13:41.155
You don't think I had
anything to do with this.

13:41.487 --> 13:44.696
Oh, we need to check out everybody
who had contact with Robert recently.

13:45.057 --> 13:46.468
We understand there
was some contention

13:46.525 --> 13:47.868
between you two about
the bridge project.

13:48.160 --> 13:50.572
We found Robert's cell phone
at the construction site.

13:51.063 --> 13:52.906
In it, there was an
appointment at 9:30,

13:52.965 --> 13:55.309
with someone with
the initials "S.B."

14:03.275 --> 14:08.384
You know, we did talk about setting
something up for 9:30, this morning.

14:09.849 --> 14:11.590
But he never got back to me.

14:11.650 --> 14:13.152
Maybe he put it in his phone wrong.

14:14.486 --> 14:16.022
Sorry to intrude.

14:16.088 --> 14:17.624
We've got Johnson
Construction down here,

14:17.690 --> 14:19.226
asking about the permits
for the highway.

14:19.291 --> 14:21.066
Tell them I'll be there
in a few. All right.

14:21.126 --> 14:24.539
Wait a minute. Tell these
detectives where I was last night.

14:24.797 --> 14:25.867
Oh.

14:26.799 --> 14:29.279
He was with a bunch of us down at the club.
Taking all our money.

14:32.938 --> 14:34.747
You need to know how much?

14:35.574 --> 14:38.054
That's okay. We're done for now.

14:39.678 --> 14:41.658
Thank you for your time.

14:50.923 --> 14:52.231
Wait a second.

14:54.093 --> 14:55.868
Get in here.

15:03.702 --> 15:04.806
We have a problem.

15:05.104 --> 15:07.345
What problem? Cops bought it.

15:08.507 --> 15:10.384
One of them is a Grimm.

15:35.167 --> 15:38.671
Detective Burkhardt. I was surprised,
but so glad you called.

15:38.737 --> 15:39.841
Would you like some carrot cake?

15:40.172 --> 15:42.015
My wife, Phoebe,
left me two of them.

15:42.574 --> 15:45.145
She's at her mother's in
Terre Haute with the kids.

15:45.210 --> 15:46.917
She misses her mother.

15:46.979 --> 15:49.391
I don't, but, hey, that's
nothing you need to worry about.

15:49.448 --> 15:50.859
I just need some help.

15:50.916 --> 15:52.691
Absolutely. Whatever
you need I'm there.

15:52.952 --> 15:55.193
I'm trying to track down a witness.

15:55.254 --> 15:57.291
Wow. Okay. Not what I expected.

15:57.756 --> 15:59.997
To Robert Grosszahn's murder?

16:00.659 --> 16:02.070
And I was thinking it
might be someone you know.

16:02.127 --> 16:03.470
A Arnold Rosarot?

16:03.929 --> 16:06.375
Arnold? You... You...

16:06.899 --> 16:08.037
Arnold saw Robert's murder?

16:08.100 --> 16:09.340
Well, he's the one who called 911.

16:09.401 --> 16:11.904
But I have not been
able to track him down,

16:11.971 --> 16:13.882
and I was hoping you might be
able to tell me where he is.

16:14.540 --> 16:16.747
I wish I could help you,
but I haven't seen Arnold in weeks.

16:17.843 --> 16:20.449
Well, one more thing.

16:22.047 --> 16:24.459
Do you have any idea
what this is? Ugh!

16:25.217 --> 16:28.164
You think that's who
murdered Robert.

16:28.420 --> 16:29.524
Well, that's what I'm
trying to find out.

16:29.955 --> 16:33.493
Well, Arnold was working
on a bridge for Robert.

16:34.226 --> 16:37.070
And the Hasslichen,
they have a real thing for bridges.

16:37.129 --> 16:39.040
They... They think they own them.

16:39.098 --> 16:41.704
No one touches them without
those guys getting a cut.

16:41.767 --> 16:42.905
So, you're talking extortion.

16:43.168 --> 16:44.943
Well... Tradition.

16:45.838 --> 16:49.445
It's just that it's always
been this way No one likes it.

16:49.508 --> 16:52.717
You see, most of the construction
firms in town are Eisbiber,

16:52.778 --> 16:54.689
which means you've
got to pay the troll.

16:55.147 --> 16:57.058
Soto speak. Listen to me.

16:58.117 --> 17:01.690
I need to find Arnold if I'm ever
going to bring this guy down.

17:02.087 --> 17:03.191
Okay.

17:03.989 --> 17:06.526
Okay, if Arnold's hiding
I might know where.

17:07.092 --> 17:09.766
If I'm right,
I'll come to your house

17:10.128 --> 17:12.575
and carve a small series of
numbers on the porch steps.

17:12.798 --> 17:13.867
The odd numbers will
mean that you...

17:13.932 --> 17:15.502
Or just call me.

17:16.801 --> 17:19.009
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hah! That would work, too.

17:19.070 --> 17:21.017
Yeah. I'll call you. Huh?

17:21.073 --> 17:22.108
All right. Thanks, Bud.

17:22.174 --> 17:23.675
Sure. Sure thing.

17:28.079 --> 17:29.525
Looks good.

17:31.283 --> 17:32.421
Hey.

17:39.425 --> 17:41.268
Hey. Welcome to our home.

17:41.393 --> 17:43.600
Thanks. Oh, it's great to be here.

17:43.962 --> 17:45.168
Oh, you didn't have to do all this.

17:45.264 --> 17:46.641
Yes, I did.

17:50.569 --> 17:52.378
Hi, Nick. Hi, Monroe.

17:54.406 --> 17:56.181
How's it going? Good.

17:56.241 --> 17:57.481
How's it going with you?

17:57.910 --> 17:59.082
Good.

18:01.780 --> 18:03.191
Ah! Let me get your coat.

18:03.248 --> 18:05.728
Oh, sorry. Thanks, Nick.

18:06.051 --> 18:07.689
I hope you like vegan salmon.

18:08.020 --> 18:10.227
Ah! I love vegan salmon.

18:10.289 --> 18:13.498
Good. Well, come on in.
I'm going to go put these in water.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.946
It was a vintage Lusina,

18:24.002 --> 18:27.472
Valjoux movement, triple chronograph,
original complications.

18:27.573 --> 18:29.075
Which means month and date.

18:29.141 --> 18:31.621
So, I open the back of
this grand old watch,

18:31.677 --> 18:33.953
and the killer had put glue
in it to stop the movement.

18:34.012 --> 18:38.290
At the exact time and date that he
was sentenced to prison for life.

18:38.350 --> 18:41.490
That's crazy. So,
you've helped Nick a few times?

18:41.553 --> 18:43.032
Yeah. You know, whenever I can.

18:43.555 --> 18:44.659
So, how did you guys meet?

18:46.625 --> 18:49.469
Well. We met when that
little girl was kidnapped.

18:49.728 --> 18:52.174
Oh, I remember that That was awful.

18:52.231 --> 18:54.142
You helped with that case,
too? Sure did.

18:54.900 --> 18:57.005
Well, what did you do?
Were there clocks involved?

18:57.069 --> 18:58.275
Mmm-mmm.

18:58.337 --> 19:00.078
No, in that case,
it had nothing to do with clocks.

19:00.139 --> 19:01.311
It had to do with boots.

19:02.641 --> 19:04.780
Boots? Yes,
a particular kind of boot.

19:05.344 --> 19:06.618
See, there was a print in the park

19:06.678 --> 19:07.918
across the street from
where Monroe lives.

19:08.313 --> 19:09.758
And believe it or not,

19:09.815 --> 19:12.819
I saw those very same
boots on my local postman.

19:12.885 --> 19:14.387
Who happened to be the
guy that we were after.

19:15.521 --> 19:16.761
Well, that was kind of lucky.

19:16.822 --> 19:19.098
Well, a little luck,
a little skill.

19:20.025 --> 19:21.299
You develop a nose
for these things.

19:21.360 --> 19:23.237
That's amazing.
Based on a pair of boots,

19:23.295 --> 19:24.467
you could find out
where the guy lived.

19:24.530 --> 19:26.908
Yeah. And his cabin
is way out there.

19:27.566 --> 19:29.978
I don't think Nick could
have found it without me.

19:30.035 --> 19:31.673
You went there with Nick?

19:31.737 --> 19:32.909
I thought you went there with Hank.

19:32.971 --> 19:34.109
I did.

19:34.173 --> 19:35.413
And with you, too?

19:38.043 --> 19:39.113
Yes. No.

19:39.411 --> 19:41.220
I mean, yes, in a sense that...

19:42.447 --> 19:45.724
I knew that the cabin was owned

19:46.552 --> 19:48.657
by the postman who wore the boots.
Because, uh...

19:48.820 --> 19:50.322
Because...

19:51.423 --> 19:52.834
I told him where it was.

19:54.426 --> 19:55.962
You told him where the cabin was.

19:56.028 --> 19:57.939
I thought he told you
where the cabin was.

19:57.996 --> 19:59.475
Who? Monroe.

20:00.599 --> 20:02.636
I did. JULIETTE:
You told him about the cabin.

20:03.035 --> 20:04.708
No, I told him about the boots.
Because, uh...

20:04.770 --> 20:06.306
The boots led us to the cabin.

20:07.806 --> 20:10.685
Which means, in other words,
without the boots,

20:10.742 --> 20:11.812
there would be no cabin.

20:11.877 --> 20:14.187
This is so delicious,
I can't even explain it.

20:14.913 --> 20:17.757
Is it, by any chance,
honey-pepper cedar plank vegan salmon?

20:18.150 --> 20:22.428
Because mark my words, I am not leaving
your house without this recipe.

20:25.324 --> 20:28.362
Can I have it now,
actually? Just to be safe?

20:38.604 --> 20:39.708
We need to talk.

20:42.507 --> 20:44.282
What's wrong? You're hiding Arnold.

20:44.610 --> 20:46.055
What? No. What are
you talking about?

20:46.111 --> 20:49.422
Nick told me Arnold saw what
happened to Robert Grosszahn.

20:49.481 --> 20:52.018
And if Arnold is hiding,
this is the first place he'd go.

20:52.084 --> 20:53.961
But I would... Don't but me, John.

20:54.586 --> 20:56.395
I checked your side yard.

20:56.455 --> 20:58.230
You pulled a tarp over
the basement doors

20:58.290 --> 20:59.667
and pushed those
potted ferns around

20:59.725 --> 21:01.170
to block sight lines
from the street.

21:01.226 --> 21:03.297
Well, I had to do something.
If the Hasslich find him...

21:03.362 --> 21:06.206
I need to talk to Arnold.
Where is he?

21:14.706 --> 21:16.379
What are you doing? Giving tours?

21:16.441 --> 21:17.579
No one is supposed
to know I'm here.

21:17.643 --> 21:19.714
Take it easy.
It's only Bud. Oh, jeez.

21:19.778 --> 21:21.621
Arnold, I know you're scared.

21:22.414 --> 21:23.449
But this isn't going to work.

21:23.515 --> 21:24.585
It's working so far.

21:24.750 --> 21:26.559
You can't stay down here
the rest of your life.

21:26.618 --> 21:28.894
If I come out now, I won't have
a life to have the rest of.

21:29.254 --> 21:31.598
You saw what happened to Robert.
You saw who did it.

21:32.090 --> 21:33.535
Believe me, l wish I hadn't.

21:33.959 --> 21:36.735
You're the only witness.
You know who killed Robert.

21:37.329 --> 21:39.707
I think you should
consider coming forward.

21:39.765 --> 21:41.540
Come forward and get killed?

21:41.600 --> 21:44.444
Come forward and have a Hasslich
do to me what he did to Robert?

21:44.503 --> 21:45.607
Or worse?

21:45.704 --> 21:47.741
There's something worse than
being buried alive in cement?

21:47.806 --> 21:49.149
We're talking about Hasslichen.

21:49.207 --> 21:51.244
Look. It doesn't
have to be that way.

21:51.476 --> 21:53.080
We're not on our own here.

21:53.145 --> 21:54.818
We have someone on our side.

21:54.880 --> 21:56.951
Nick said that he would.
Nick? Who is Nick?

21:57.015 --> 21:59.996
Nick Burkhardt. Detective
Nick Burkhardt. The Grimm.

22:00.786 --> 22:02.663
You're on a first name
basis with the Grimm?

22:02.721 --> 22:03.722
Are you out of your mind?

22:03.889 --> 22:05.493
He's not the enemy, Arnold.

22:05.557 --> 22:07.764
The Hasslichen are the enemy.

22:08.160 --> 22:09.434
No, I'm staying right here.

22:09.494 --> 22:12.532
I'm not going anywhere,
and no one can make me leave.

22:13.165 --> 22:16.374
Uh... Well, technically, I could.
This is my house.

22:17.035 --> 22:18.776
You would do that?
That's not the point.

22:19.104 --> 22:20.276
Nick wants to help.

22:20.339 --> 22:23.183
But he can't help us
if we don't help him.

22:23.241 --> 22:25.084
Do you realize what
this could mean for us?

22:25.143 --> 22:26.850
Having a Grimm on our side?

22:26.912 --> 22:28.653
It could change everything.

22:29.147 --> 22:30.649
If I tell the police
who killed Robert,

22:30.716 --> 22:33.390
it won't matter if the
Hasslichen can't find me.

22:33.452 --> 22:34.863
They'll just kill one of you.

22:34.920 --> 22:36.661
Or two of you. Or three of you.

22:36.722 --> 22:38.065
Their point still gets made.

22:38.523 --> 22:39.593
Don't rock the boat.

22:39.958 --> 22:40.993
Arnold's right.

22:41.460 --> 22:42.996
This is something
that affects us all.

22:43.061 --> 22:44.665
We need to take this to the lodge.

22:44.730 --> 22:46.437
Lodge? No. No,
then everyone will know.

22:46.498 --> 22:48.808
Wait. Oblinger has a point.

22:49.501 --> 22:52.175
We'll do this the way we always do it.
Fair and democratic.

22:52.571 --> 22:55.279
Everyone gets heard.
Then, we'll put it to a vote.

22:55.340 --> 22:56.717
We all have a stake in this.

22:57.242 --> 22:58.243
What do you say?

22:58.577 --> 22:59.715
I don't know.

23:00.679 --> 23:02.283
I just want it to all go away.

23:02.814 --> 23:04.794
Sometimes, it doesn't go away

23:04.850 --> 23:06.852
unless you make it go away.

23:07.119 --> 23:08.154
Hmm?

23:11.723 --> 23:14.636
This situation can turn
into a big problem.

23:15.394 --> 23:16.566
For all of us.

23:16.628 --> 23:19.541
All right. All right.
Let's not panic.

23:20.365 --> 23:23.039
You didn't have a
Grimm in your office,

23:23.101 --> 23:25.342
questioning you about a murder.

23:25.771 --> 23:27.114
He saw me.

23:27.839 --> 23:29.113
He knows.

23:29.541 --> 23:30.986
Then we could leave town.

23:31.042 --> 23:32.316
Wait for all this to blow over.

23:32.377 --> 23:33.947
Are you kidding?

23:34.012 --> 23:36.117
Might as well send them
a signed confession.

23:36.515 --> 23:38.722
Well, I was actually just
talking about me and Herman.

23:38.784 --> 23:40.764
I mean, you could call us
when the coast is clear.

23:41.019 --> 23:44.193
Well, let me clear a little
coast for you right now.

23:44.823 --> 23:47.702
We're going to kill him.
It's the only way.

23:48.360 --> 23:51.136
Kill a Grimm? I mean,
is that even possible?

23:54.599 --> 23:56.135
The Grimm needs to be dealt with.

23:56.201 --> 23:57.202
But how?

23:57.402 --> 23:59.746
Same way Grimms have
always been dealt with.

24:00.839 --> 24:01.943
Reapers.

24:04.142 --> 24:05.815
You... You're talking
about going nuclear.

24:05.944 --> 24:08.584
I'm talking about
protecting ourselves.

24:09.147 --> 24:10.592
Protecting what we've built.

24:10.649 --> 24:12.595
This is crazy. A Reaper.

24:13.385 --> 24:14.523
Where would we even find one?

24:15.454 --> 24:17.798
My great uncle, Mamoose, was one.

24:18.924 --> 24:22.963
They made him a Reaper after he cut
the head off a Grimm in Copenhagen.

24:25.530 --> 24:27.407
Sal, are you sure this
is the thing to do?

24:28.166 --> 24:29.406
Give me another choice.

24:30.135 --> 24:31.273
Yeah.

24:36.107 --> 24:38.246
So, what did you think?

24:38.877 --> 24:42.484
Well, Monroe is definitely one of
the stranger people I have ever met.

24:42.547 --> 24:45.460
But he did save my life,
and I think I love him.

24:45.984 --> 24:48.396
Well, should I be jealous?

24:49.721 --> 24:51.496
Maybe.

24:51.556 --> 24:52.660
Ooh!

24:53.992 --> 24:55.528
Burkhardt. Hey, Nick.

24:55.594 --> 24:56.868
Sorry to call so late.

24:56.928 --> 24:58.168
And I hope I'm not
interrupting anything

24:58.230 --> 24:59.641
with you and your
lady friend, Juliette.

24:59.698 --> 25:01.405
Whom I adore, by the way.

25:01.466 --> 25:02.809
Bud, what is it?

25:02.868 --> 25:04.939
Can you be at the old power
plant at the Bull Run Dam,

25:05.003 --> 25:06.880
tomorrow night at 9:00?

25:06.938 --> 25:08.576
We're calling an
emergency lodge meeting.

25:08.640 --> 25:10.711
And Arnold will be there.
And so will I.

25:10.775 --> 25:11.845
Bud, thank you so much.

25:11.910 --> 25:12.980
You're welcome, Nick.

25:13.044 --> 25:15.524
Er... Mr... Detective Burkhardt.

25:16.081 --> 25:17.151
Nick is fine.

26:42.400 --> 26:43.902
It's me! Don't shoot! Don't...
Don't shoot!

26:43.969 --> 26:45.039
Sorry.

26:45.103 --> 26:46.241
No. No.

26:46.304 --> 26:49.251
You've got to be ready.
You just never know, I know.

26:49.574 --> 26:51.144
You face death every day. I don't.

26:51.209 --> 26:52.916
So, where is this meeting?
It's in the lodge.

26:53.345 --> 26:54.483
We've got to take the stairs.

26:54.546 --> 26:57.459
Look, I'm going to take you in,
make an introduction,

26:57.515 --> 26:58.960
and then, you'll,
you know, make it clear

26:59.017 --> 27:00.553
that there's a threat
to our society.

27:00.619 --> 27:02.030
And that the only
way to deal with it

27:02.087 --> 27:04.226
is to take responsibility
for our own...

27:04.289 --> 27:07.031
Look, I don't want to
tell you what to say.

27:07.092 --> 27:09.470
Even though,
I guess I already have.

27:19.170 --> 27:20.171
Yeah.

27:20.238 --> 27:21.581
You called for us.

27:22.007 --> 27:23.145
And we are here.

27:23.541 --> 27:24.781
Already?

27:24.909 --> 27:28.789
We need to meet.
Don't keep us waiting.

27:32.417 --> 27:34.454
Yeah. Just tell me where.

27:36.021 --> 27:37.227
Eisbibers and Hasslichen

27:37.288 --> 27:39.825
have lived by certain
customs for centuries.

27:40.325 --> 27:42.066
I can't say that I like it.

27:42.127 --> 27:44.232
Nor can I say that it's fair.

27:44.562 --> 27:46.041
But what I can say,

27:46.097 --> 27:48.941
is that as long as each of
us lives by those customs

27:49.000 --> 27:50.035
no one gets hurt.

27:52.470 --> 27:54.279
Quiet! With all due respect,

27:54.673 --> 27:57.017
we're getting hurt all the time.

27:57.208 --> 27:59.279
We're living in constant fear.

27:59.944 --> 28:01.981
And that's no way to live.

28:02.047 --> 28:04.789
We've got to stand
up to these monsters.

28:06.951 --> 28:08.157
Order!

28:08.219 --> 28:09.289
Order!

28:10.655 --> 28:14.569
The assembly has been advised
of tonight's question.

28:15.260 --> 28:20.039
Will Eisenbud Wurstner please come
forward and introduce our guest?

28:20.498 --> 28:24.310
Mr. Speaker, thank you for allowing
me to request this meeting.

28:25.170 --> 28:27.047
If it pleases the lodge,

28:27.105 --> 28:30.143
I would like to introduce
Detective Nicholas Burkhardt

28:30.208 --> 28:32.119
of the Portland Police Department.

28:32.177 --> 28:34.521
And, I'm proud to say, my friend.

28:38.049 --> 28:39.460
One of you has witnessed a murder.

28:40.318 --> 28:42.059
And without that testimony,

28:42.587 --> 28:44.897
that murderer might
very well walk free.

28:45.924 --> 28:48.131
Look, I understand your fear.

28:48.960 --> 28:52.407
I really do. But I want you to
know that things can change.

28:53.298 --> 28:54.777
I'm a Grimm.

28:55.400 --> 28:57.311
And I'm also a cop.
And I can help you.

28:58.002 --> 29:00.175
But only if you help
yourselves first.

29:00.238 --> 29:02.912
So, please, let Arnold Rosarot know

29:03.508 --> 29:05.249
that if he comes forward,
then together,

29:05.310 --> 29:08.154
we can put an end to
this Hasslich threat.

29:08.713 --> 29:13.355
When someone defies the Hasslichen,
they send us a message.

29:14.219 --> 29:16.460
I don't want my
husband or my children

29:16.521 --> 29:18.933
to end up being that message.

29:18.990 --> 29:21.561
I say we send a message
back to the Hasslichen.

29:21.926 --> 29:25.601
We've got a Grimm. You mess with us,
you lose your head.

29:27.065 --> 29:30.308
PARLIAMENTARY OFFICER:
Call to order!

29:30.802 --> 29:32.042
Order!

29:33.471 --> 29:36.315
We will put the question to a vote.

29:36.941 --> 29:40.184
All those in favor of the
witness coming forward.

29:43.681 --> 29:45.217
Those opposed.

29:50.889 --> 29:54.666
I move to request that the Grimm

29:54.726 --> 29:59.402
does not cut off our heads for
opposing him on this question.

30:02.066 --> 30:03.340
We are...

30:04.569 --> 30:06.105
We are what we are.

30:15.513 --> 30:17.117
Nick, I'm sorry.

30:18.016 --> 30:19.086
You did your best.

30:19.150 --> 30:21.528
I really thought we had a
chance to change things.

30:21.586 --> 30:24.692
It's just that bravery
isn't in our nature.

30:24.756 --> 30:26.030
Yeah, I don't know about that, Bud.

30:26.724 --> 30:29.967
Even after you knew what I was,
you still came to my house.

30:30.028 --> 30:32.201
Fixed my door,
brought me pie and a quilt.

30:32.263 --> 30:33.401
And that took guts.

30:34.799 --> 30:36.472
I figured, if you could do it,
so could they.

30:37.735 --> 30:39.908
Thanks for trying.

31:01.826 --> 31:03.863
Anybody here? I'm here.

31:06.130 --> 31:09.134
There you are.
I'm Salvadore Butrell.

31:23.047 --> 31:24.424
We failed.

31:24.749 --> 31:26.285
We had our chance, and we blew it.

31:26.351 --> 31:28.456
Well, he must understand
the position Arnold is in.

31:28.519 --> 31:31.056
It's not just Arnold.
It's all of us.

31:31.256 --> 31:34.260
At that meeting,
I saw us through Nick's eyes.

31:34.325 --> 31:36.601
I saw us for what we really are.

31:37.228 --> 31:40.835
I wouldn't be surprised if the
Grimm never speaks to us again.

31:40.899 --> 31:42.276
I can't believe I just said that.

31:42.600 --> 31:45.342
Yeah, well I never
thought I'd say this,

31:45.403 --> 31:47.576
but for the first time in my life,

31:47.639 --> 31:49.846
I'm ashamed to be an Eisbiber.

32:05.156 --> 32:06.499
We have questions.

32:07.959 --> 32:11.372
Yeah, sure. Anything.
I'm the one that called you guys.

32:16.200 --> 32:18.680
I'm the one whose great
uncle used to be a Reaper.

32:20.471 --> 32:22.815
Not one bit of physical evidence
to tie Sal to the murder.

32:23.074 --> 32:24.985
And he's got a solid alibi.

32:25.043 --> 32:27.683
Three guys can vouch that he was
playing poker with them that night.

32:27.745 --> 32:29.691
What about the witness?
Still in the wind.

32:29.747 --> 32:32.421
Checked his home, his work.
Put an A.P.B. out on his car.

32:32.483 --> 32:33.553
Coming up empty-

32:33.618 --> 32:35.427
Do we know if he's still alive?
Haven't found a body.

32:35.486 --> 32:36.965
My guess is he's too
terrified to come forward.

32:37.488 --> 32:39.331
Yeah, he's not too
terrified to call 911.

32:39.390 --> 32:41.700
But when push comes to shove,
he won't come forward.

32:41.759 --> 32:42.897
What kind of person is this?

32:43.428 --> 32:44.736
We have nothing unless
we find this guy

32:44.796 --> 32:46.469
and convince him to
do his civic duty.

32:46.698 --> 32:47.733
Put some more people on this.

32:47.799 --> 32:48.869
Otherwise, we're
gonna lose this case.

32:49.500 --> 32:51.980
All right,
we'll rattle a few cages.

32:57.709 --> 32:59.416
I'll be right there.

33:00.878 --> 33:02.289
What's going on?
We've done a lot of talking.

33:02.680 --> 33:03.852
A lot of talking.
I mean, we could tell you

33:03.915 --> 33:04.950
how much talking we've done.

33:09.554 --> 33:11.556
I'm Arnold Rosarot. And, um...

33:14.425 --> 33:16.336
I...I think I'm ready to help.

33:23.368 --> 33:25.871
We hear the Grimm has friends here.

33:27.138 --> 33:28.139
He's not my friend.

33:28.206 --> 33:29.344
So you say.

33:30.041 --> 33:32.521
I'm telling you the truth.
Why else would I call you?

33:32.577 --> 33:34.523
That's what we are
going to find out.

33:38.149 --> 33:39.628
What the hell is the
matter with you guys?

33:39.917 --> 33:42.227
Deliver us the Grimm or die.

33:42.854 --> 33:46.131
He's a detective.
For the Portland PD.

33:47.492 --> 33:48.732
His name is Burkhardt.

33:49.093 --> 33:51.505
Do you suggest we simply
walk into the police station,

33:51.562 --> 33:54.907
ask for Detective Burkhardt,
and cut off his head?

33:55.266 --> 33:57.712
I don't know.
You guys are the experts.

34:01.973 --> 34:04.476
If he's not your friend,
why is he calling you?

34:07.111 --> 34:09.284
Hello. Salvadore Butrell.

34:10.047 --> 34:11.356
This is Detective Nick Burkhardt.

34:11.716 --> 34:12.956
What can I do for you?

34:13.016 --> 34:14.621
We have a few more
questions for you.

34:14.685 --> 34:15.958
We're gonna need you
to come downtown.

34:21.426 --> 34:24.235
What if I don't want to go downtown
to answer any more questions?

34:24.795 --> 34:27.106
I'll be forced to send
officers to make sure you do.

34:27.398 --> 34:29.878
Look, let's just cut to the chase.

34:29.934 --> 34:31.777
I know what you are.
You know what I am.

34:32.603 --> 34:34.139
Let's just have a face to face.

34:35.106 --> 34:37.085
Off the record, so to speak.

34:38.176 --> 34:41.521
I'll make it worth your
while in more ways than one.

34:42.914 --> 34:44.893
I'll be at my club in 10 minutes.

34:48.386 --> 34:49.797
Well, we better hurry, guys.

34:49.920 --> 34:51.092
It would be a shame if he got there

34:51.155 --> 34:53.362
and we weren't there to greet him.

34:55.460 --> 34:57.337
Portland PD! Open up!

35:02.233 --> 35:04.110
Detectives. What a surprise.

35:04.335 --> 35:05.541
What happened to you?

35:05.603 --> 35:06.707
Family reunion.

35:06.771 --> 35:08.011
Salvadore Butrell,
you're under arrest

35:08.072 --> 35:10.416
for the murder of Robert Grosszahn.

35:10.942 --> 35:12.922
You have the right
to remain silent.

35:12.977 --> 35:14.388
Anything you say

35:14.445 --> 35:16.447
can and will be used against
you in a court of law.

35:38.136 --> 35:40.343
Do you see the man who
killed Robert Grosszahn?

35:41.639 --> 35:43.676
Third man from the right.

35:43.741 --> 35:46.085
Just take your time Are you sure?

35:46.777 --> 35:49.257
I'm sure. That's him.

35:55.086 --> 35:58.932
Let the record show the witness
has identified Salvadore Butrell.

36:03.194 --> 36:04.935
Did I do all right? You did great.

36:04.996 --> 36:08.170
We got Sal Butrell locked up
and waiting for arraignment.

36:09.267 --> 36:12.009
I know this wasn't easy.
I'm proud of you.

36:15.740 --> 36:17.117
Look, Arnold,

36:17.175 --> 36:18.483
you might wanna lay low
for a little while,

36:18.543 --> 36:19.954
just to be on the safe side.

36:20.011 --> 36:21.888
How about the lodge?
You'd be safe there, huh?

36:21.946 --> 36:24.483
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure.
Sure, yeah. The lodge is good.

36:24.549 --> 36:25.619
I... I like the lodge. Okay.

36:25.683 --> 36:26.753
I'll drive you there myself,

36:26.817 --> 36:28.319
just to be sure you get there okay.

37:17.568 --> 37:18.911
I think we're being followed.

37:18.970 --> 37:21.576
I've been watching the same
headlights for the last 10 minutes.

37:21.639 --> 37:22.709
We better call Nick.

37:39.323 --> 37:41.269
Get inside.

37:54.305 --> 37:55.750
Go to the lodge Stay there.

37:55.806 --> 37:57.808
Shouldn't we stay here and help?
I'm not afraid.

37:57.875 --> 37:59.877
I'm staying if you guys do. Go.

37:59.944 --> 38:01.184
Come on.

39:09.246 --> 39:10.384
Hey, Nick. What up?

39:11.682 --> 39:13.389
I'm at the Bull Run Dam.
Can you come out here?

39:13.751 --> 39:14.957
Why, do you need some help?

39:15.986 --> 39:18.227
Sort of. Monroe?

39:19.857 --> 39:20.995
Bring a shovel.

39:47.585 --> 39:48.586
Nick?

39:48.652 --> 39:49.687
In here.

39:52.390 --> 39:54.199
Oh, my God.

39:57.461 --> 39:58.565
Dude.

40:00.931 --> 40:02.774
You took out two Reapers.

40:07.471 --> 40:09.348
Vernichter der Grimms.

40:10.107 --> 40:11.643
Reapers of the Grimms.

40:12.309 --> 40:15.449
They're just going to keep coming
for me until I'm dead, aren't they?

40:16.914 --> 40:19.326
Uh, yeah. I'm pretty
sure that's how it works.

40:20.050 --> 40:21.961
I think I need to
send them a message.

40:22.019 --> 40:23.259
I think you do, too.

40:24.588 --> 40:26.124
And you know what?

40:27.091 --> 40:30.095
When it comes to sending
these guys messages,

40:31.295 --> 40:34.037
two heads are better than one

40:39.570 --> 40:41.641
Surprised to see me?

40:41.705 --> 40:42.740
No.

40:45.810 --> 40:47.118
I met your friends.

40:50.581 --> 40:51.651
What happened?

40:52.483 --> 40:54.394
Oh, you know how it is.

40:55.286 --> 40:56.822
They got angry.

40:58.823 --> 41:00.029
Kind of lost their heads.

41:19.643 --> 41:21.316
Hey. What's wrong?

41:21.579 --> 41:23.422
There's just so many.

41:23.848 --> 41:25.794
What are you talking about?

41:33.224 --> 41:36.398
They've been dropping
them off all day.

41:39.196 --> 41:40.436
What did you do?

41:45.870 --> 41:47.281
Just my job.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
