WEBVTT

01:02.125 --> 01:05.208
Hannah:
Oh, my God, he really
knew so many people.

01:05.208 --> 01:07.458
It's just crazy that
you don't know the depth

01:07.458 --> 01:09.125
of someone's power
until their funeral.

01:09.125 --> 01:11.959
It's so sad.

01:11.959 --> 01:13.291
Oh, my God.

01:13.291 --> 01:15.625
I think I see
Zadie Smith.

01:15.625 --> 01:17.083
That is definitely her.

01:17.083 --> 01:19.625
All right, calm down, kid.
It's a funeral.

01:24.667 --> 01:27.834
Who do you know here?

01:27.834 --> 01:31.667
Uh, that's David's
assistant, Bob.

01:46.458 --> 01:48.917
- Hi, Bob.
- Oh.

01:48.917 --> 01:50.291
I'm so sorry
for your loss.

01:50.291 --> 01:51.667
Oh, hi, Hannah.
Thank you.

01:51.667 --> 01:53.250
Woman:
Oh, Bob.

01:53.250 --> 01:56.834
Bob.
Sweet, sweet Bob.

01:56.834 --> 01:59.333
What would I do
without you?

02:00.625 --> 02:02.041
Hi, I'm Adam.

02:02.041 --> 02:04.542
- Oh, hi, Adam.
- Hi.

02:04.542 --> 02:05.834
- Hi.
- This is Hannah.

02:05.834 --> 02:08.458
- Hannah, hi.
- A pleasure to make
your acquaintance.

02:08.458 --> 02:09.834
I'm Annaliese.

02:09.834 --> 02:12.875
Oh, you haven't met.
This is David's wife.

02:12.875 --> 02:15.375
- ( whimpers )
- Oh, you're--

02:15.375 --> 02:17.083
you're David's wife, yes.

02:17.083 --> 02:20.542
- So, you two
lived together...
- Yes.

02:20.542 --> 02:23.875
...romantically
as well as maritally.

02:23.875 --> 02:27.041
I'm sorry, I-- how did
you know my husband?

02:27.041 --> 02:29.875
- This one.
- Uh, yes, I was writing
my memoir for him.

02:29.875 --> 02:31.166
Okay.

02:32.083 --> 02:33.708
Oh.

02:33.708 --> 02:34.959
Oh, my gosh.

02:34.959 --> 02:37.583
Oh, I know exactly
who you are.

02:37.583 --> 02:41.250
David spoke about you
all the time.

02:41.250 --> 02:43.208
- He did?
- He did.

02:43.208 --> 02:44.875
Oh, gosh,
he loved you.

02:44.875 --> 02:47.208
He really loved you
so much.

02:47.208 --> 02:48.750
You know, he always
would tell me

02:48.750 --> 02:50.959
about this amazing girl
that I needed to meet

02:50.959 --> 02:54.375
who would overcome
such obstacles.

02:54.375 --> 02:57.083
And now, finally,
I am meeting you.

02:57.083 --> 03:00.250
Thank you.
Well, my OCD is
very much in check now--

03:00.250 --> 03:02.542
But the Tourette's
and the obesity--

03:02.542 --> 03:04.291
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
That was Paige.

03:04.291 --> 03:06.917
- What?
- That wasn't Hannah.
That was Paige.

03:06.917 --> 03:08.208
- Not Hannah.
- Oh.

03:08.208 --> 03:11.458
- Obesity?
- Um, no, no, no.

03:11.458 --> 03:13.750
- I don't have Tourette's.
- I'm so sorry.

03:13.750 --> 03:15.959
- I don't know about obesity...
- If everyone could
take their seats.

03:15.959 --> 03:18.166
I've always thought
I was more chubby
than obese.

03:18.166 --> 03:20.708
No, no, no, overcame.
It's my-- I'm so sorry.

03:20.708 --> 03:22.083
- It's nice meeting you.
- No, please.

03:22.083 --> 03:23.917
It's very nice to--
Bob, where are we headed?

03:23.917 --> 03:25.708
- Thank you.
- Where are we seated?

03:32.959 --> 03:34.750
( whispers )
I thought you said
he was gay.

03:34.750 --> 03:36.375
( whispering )
Well, I don't know now.

03:36.375 --> 03:38.083
He had gay apps
on his iPhone

03:38.083 --> 03:39.625
and he liked
to show his ankles,

03:39.625 --> 03:42.625
but what does that even mean
in this day and age?

03:42.625 --> 03:45.542
Priest:
Hello, everyone.
I am Father Tudor Snowdon.

03:45.542 --> 03:50.208
Today we celebrate the life
of David Pressler-Goings.

03:50.208 --> 03:53.458
( music playing )

03:56.291 --> 03:58.667
Can we go now, please?

03:58.667 --> 04:01.875
I'm not leaving
until I have locked eyes
with Michiko Kakutani.

04:01.875 --> 04:03.166
I told you that.

04:03.166 --> 04:05.000
Adam:
I'm gonna wait outside.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.917
Hannah:
Okay.

04:09.125 --> 04:10.917
Hi again.

04:10.917 --> 04:13.542
Oh, hi.

04:13.542 --> 04:14.667
- Hannah.
- Right.

04:14.667 --> 04:16.750
- Not Paige, Hannah.
- I know.

04:16.750 --> 04:18.959
- I know, I'm sorry.
- No, don't be.

04:18.959 --> 04:21.834
I was surprised that David
had such a beautiful--

04:21.834 --> 04:24.834
just stunningly--

04:24.834 --> 04:26.834
You thought he was gay.

04:26.834 --> 04:28.917
- Uh, no.
- Yes, you did.

04:28.917 --> 04:30.917
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.
It's okay, it's okay.

04:30.917 --> 04:32.959
- I didn't. I thought
he was straight.
- It's okay.

04:32.959 --> 04:35.125
I thought he was straight.
I thought he wanted
to sleep with me.

04:35.125 --> 04:38.166
- Really, I know you--
- I mean, I wouldn't have
slept with him, but--

04:38.166 --> 04:39.542
A lot of people
think it.

04:39.542 --> 04:41.917
A lot of people
think he was gay.

04:41.917 --> 04:43.542
Well, he acted gay.

04:43.542 --> 04:46.667
And, you know,
he was...

04:46.667 --> 04:48.083
- sometimes.
- Okay.

04:48.083 --> 04:50.208
I loved working
with your husband.

04:50.208 --> 04:53.291
- David was wonderful.
- Oh, I bet.

04:53.291 --> 04:55.125
I mean, I know.

04:55.125 --> 04:58.792
Um... I'm working
on a book with David, too.

04:58.792 --> 05:00.250
I was. Was.

05:00.250 --> 05:01.834
I really hope
you finish the book,

05:01.834 --> 05:03.792
and I really, really hope
I get to read it someday.

05:03.792 --> 05:05.333
Thank you.
Yeah, I don't know.

05:05.333 --> 05:08.875
I mean, now that
Millstreet has dropped
all of David's projects,

05:08.875 --> 05:10.250
I just--

05:10.250 --> 05:12.625
I'd have to find
a new publisher, so,
you know, we'll see--

05:12.625 --> 05:15.291
Wait, you said
Millstreet's dropped
all of David's projects?

05:15.291 --> 05:17.708
Yeah-- oh, shit.
Shit.

05:17.708 --> 05:19.583
There's David's mom.
She's so devastated.

05:19.583 --> 05:21.834
- Have you seen Pepper?
Did you meet her?
- No, I didn't, no.

05:21.834 --> 05:23.583
- She's devastated
and I should--
- You were saying that--

05:23.583 --> 05:25.959
you were saying that
Millstreet's dropped
all of David's projects?

05:25.959 --> 05:28.375
Right, that's right.
For now, yeah.

05:28.375 --> 05:30.208
So my book is dead?

05:31.792 --> 05:32.708
Um...

05:32.708 --> 05:34.792
Do you happen to know
another publisher

05:34.792 --> 05:37.583
that I could maybe
slip the manuscript to

05:37.583 --> 05:39.583
if I do decide
that I really want to

05:39.583 --> 05:42.875
try to keep it alive?

05:46.250 --> 05:49.792
Okay, um, if I do
give you another name,

05:49.792 --> 05:52.291
will you get the fuck
out of here?

05:54.083 --> 05:55.625
Yes.

05:55.625 --> 05:57.750
Great.

05:57.750 --> 05:59.250
Great, I'll be back.

05:59.250 --> 06:02.250
Honestly, I just--

06:02.250 --> 06:04.500
I loved your husband.

06:04.500 --> 06:06.166
You know the person
who gave me this

06:06.166 --> 06:10.667
told me that
it used to belong
to Edna St. Vincent Millay.

06:10.667 --> 06:13.250
But who can ever know
if that's true?

06:13.250 --> 06:16.208
Can you believe that
my friend told me
that she died

06:16.208 --> 06:18.000
so that she didn't
have to hang out
with me?

06:18.000 --> 06:20.291
Yeah, no,
I totally get that.

06:20.291 --> 06:21.625
Excuse me?

06:21.625 --> 06:23.959
Okay, look,
I know that we, like,
technically live together,

06:23.959 --> 06:26.250
but this is still
very much my private home

06:26.250 --> 06:28.291
and it just is slightly
worrisome to me

06:28.291 --> 06:29.959
that all you do
all day long

06:29.959 --> 06:31.917
is sit around and watch
"The Forensic Files."

06:31.917 --> 06:33.125
And I have kept
my mouth shut until now,

06:33.125 --> 06:35.792
but I literally cannot
keep my mouth shut any longer

06:35.792 --> 06:39.166
because I really
need to study.

06:39.959 --> 06:41.750
- Since when?
- Since forever!

06:41.750 --> 06:44.834
Plus, my recent hijinks
have really taken
a toll on my GPA.

06:45.959 --> 06:48.291
But I thought this was
your time to go wild

06:48.291 --> 06:51.125
before you become
an international
business lady.

06:51.125 --> 06:53.583
Yeah, exactly,
so it's really important
to my 15-year plan

06:53.583 --> 06:55.000
that I get into
a good business school

06:55.000 --> 06:57.208
because I don't want to
become like all my friends
and family,

06:57.208 --> 06:59.542
yourself included,
no offense.

06:59.542 --> 07:01.458
What happens after
the 15-year plan?

07:01.458 --> 07:03.375
It would be, like, insane
to think about that.

07:06.333 --> 07:07.834
Oh, yes.

07:07.834 --> 07:09.458
Yes, I could definitely
come in tomorrow.

07:09.458 --> 07:11.375
Adam:
...conditioner later
and then it's deodorant.

07:11.375 --> 07:13.583
Caroline: Why? Why?
Why are you inherently
disinclined

07:13.583 --> 07:14.792
to support me in any way?

07:14.792 --> 07:16.708
- Adam: You're living
in my house.
- Oh, God!

07:16.708 --> 07:18.875
Thank you so much.
I will see you then.

07:18.875 --> 07:21.125
- I really appreciate it.
- ( argument continues )

07:21.125 --> 07:22.458
Why should I give
you anything?

07:22.458 --> 07:24.625
Oh, right, God forbid.
God forbid we assist
one another, right?

07:24.625 --> 07:26.500
- Simply because we share
the same blood.
- Guys...

07:26.500 --> 07:28.000
Forget about the fact
that I spent

07:28.000 --> 07:29.542
my formative years
raising you because Verna

07:29.542 --> 07:31.500
- had absolutely no interest.
- No, I never asked you
for anything.

07:31.500 --> 07:33.083
- No one ever asked you
for anything.
- Oh, please.

07:33.083 --> 07:34.417
You can't be bothered
to do anything for anybody.

07:34.417 --> 07:35.792
You need something
from everyone all the time--

07:35.792 --> 07:38.583
( screams )
Whoa!

07:38.583 --> 07:40.542
Oh, my God.

07:40.542 --> 07:42.041
Seriously.

07:42.041 --> 07:44.875
Seriously, it's already been
a very long day for me,

07:44.875 --> 07:47.041
and what I need
is a peaceful house

07:47.041 --> 07:48.583
where people
are centered.

07:48.583 --> 07:50.083
See what you're doing,
Caroline?

07:50.083 --> 07:52.250
You're upsetting Hannah
when she just found out
her book is dead.

07:52.250 --> 07:54.250
I actually just found out
I have a very exciting meeting

07:54.250 --> 07:56.875
with a publisher who I think
is pretty interested.

07:56.875 --> 07:58.375
I was just trying
to make myself a meal.

07:58.375 --> 08:00.458
- Just feeding myself--
- With my last eggs.

08:00.458 --> 08:04.041
Guys, I cannot take
this anymore, okay?

08:04.041 --> 08:05.417
We have to work
this out.

08:05.417 --> 08:07.041
There is no
working this out.

08:07.041 --> 08:09.125
Okay, I've watched enough
"Dr. Phils" and "Interventions"

08:09.125 --> 08:12.458
to know you can
work anything out
if you talk about it.

08:12.458 --> 08:13.542
I would love to.

08:13.542 --> 08:16.291
Thank you, Caroline.
I appreciate that.

08:16.291 --> 08:17.583
Adam?

08:17.583 --> 08:20.708
Will you join us
at the listening table?

08:21.792 --> 08:24.750
- Please?
- ( laughs )

08:25.834 --> 08:27.333
Come on.

08:27.333 --> 08:29.417
Thank you.

08:30.708 --> 08:33.417
Okay, I think
we should all start

08:33.417 --> 08:37.082
by acknowledging
that we all really care
about each other.

08:37.082 --> 08:39.375
So, Caroline,
tell me you love me.

08:39.375 --> 08:40.750
Hannah, I love you.

08:40.750 --> 08:43.667
I love you, too.
Adam, you tell me
you love me.

08:43.667 --> 08:45.917
Why are we telling you
we love you?

08:45.917 --> 08:48.375
( sighs )
Okay, so then
why don't you both

08:48.375 --> 08:50.208
just tell each other
that you love each other?

08:50.208 --> 08:51.792
- Adam, I love you.
- This is dumb.

08:51.792 --> 08:53.750
Hannah:
Okay, emotions are
running high right now,

08:53.750 --> 08:55.375
and I think
it's really important

08:55.375 --> 08:57.417
that we avoid using
inflammatory language--

08:57.417 --> 08:58.875
words like "dumb,"

08:58.875 --> 09:01.667
words like "skank,"
"fatty."

09:01.667 --> 09:04.500
Let's just acknowledge
that we're here
for each other

09:04.500 --> 09:06.291
and make this
a safe space.

09:06.291 --> 09:07.542
So, Adam, why don't
you just begin

09:07.542 --> 09:10.583
by telling Caroline
what some of your issues
are with her

09:10.583 --> 09:13.166
in a very calm,
rational way?

09:15.375 --> 09:19.959
I feel like
she's an evil person

09:19.959 --> 09:23.750
who pukes on everything,
metaphorically.

09:23.750 --> 09:26.917
Okay, maybe perhaps
you could elaborate on that...

09:26.917 --> 09:28.834
- Jeez.
- ...and be a little bit
more specific

09:28.834 --> 09:30.834
with some of your
issues with me.

09:30.834 --> 09:32.625
- Okay, specifically...
- Mm-hmm.

09:32.625 --> 09:34.667
...you don't know
what you want to do
with your life.

09:34.667 --> 09:37.458
You have no drive,
no real goals,

09:37.458 --> 09:39.375
but somehow
tons of opinions.

09:39.375 --> 09:42.708
Hannah: Interesting,
interesting, interesting,
interesting, interesting.

09:42.708 --> 09:44.917
Why is that interesting
seven times?

09:44.917 --> 09:47.417
I just have to say

09:47.417 --> 09:49.166
that sounds
a lot like you.

09:49.166 --> 09:50.291
Whose side are you on?

09:50.291 --> 09:51.625
She's not on anyone's side.

09:51.625 --> 09:53.000
She's the Dr. Phil.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.667
Well, it's easy to say
when she's on your side.

09:54.667 --> 09:56.500
- I'm not on anyone's side.
- ( mocking gibberish )

09:56.500 --> 09:58.000
I'm not on anyone's side.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.542
( whispering )
I'm on your side.

09:59.542 --> 10:01.708
If I had to pick a side,
it would be your side.

10:01.708 --> 10:03.500
This is something
I'm doing for us.

10:03.500 --> 10:05.250
Why are you whispering?
She can hear you.

10:05.250 --> 10:08.667
I can hear you.
I'm sitting right here.

10:08.667 --> 10:13.583
- What is that?
- This is a space cigarette,
invented by Stephen Dorff.

10:13.583 --> 10:15.291
It's just water vapor
and nicotine

10:15.291 --> 10:17.542
and good things
like that, you know?

10:17.542 --> 10:20.417
I'm really on a mission
to improve myself.

10:20.417 --> 10:22.417
Okay, if you're serious
about improving yourself,

10:22.417 --> 10:24.875
you need to do more
than just, like, smoke
Dorff cigarettes.

10:24.875 --> 10:27.375
You need to,
like, grocery shop
and condition your hair,

10:27.375 --> 10:29.583
even though
I know it does so well
with natural oils.

10:29.583 --> 10:31.000
Jessa:
I'm gonna get that job.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.125
Are you sure
that's the kind of job
you should be having?

10:33.125 --> 10:35.583
Like, being near things
that children are near?

10:35.583 --> 10:39.333
Yeah, I want something
with a touch of innocence.

10:41.041 --> 10:43.500
Shoshanna:
You have a criminal record!

10:44.708 --> 10:45.834
Adam:
No, I'm not like you.

10:45.834 --> 10:47.750
I'm not a different person
every other week.

10:47.750 --> 10:49.250
- Oh, really?
- You're hearing each other.

10:49.250 --> 10:51.250
- Let's keep doing that.
- Really? Oh, what is it?

10:51.250 --> 10:53.333
Okay, it was
an actor last week.

10:53.333 --> 10:54.750
What was it before that,
a woodworker, huh?

10:54.750 --> 10:56.041
And the last time
I saw you, you were, what,

10:56.041 --> 10:58.959
you were gonna go join
the special armed forces,
G.I. Joe?

10:58.959 --> 11:00.667
- Those are professions.
- That's crazy.

11:00.667 --> 11:03.375
I remain the same,
whereas you move to Montana,

11:03.375 --> 11:07.083
put on a phony accent,
and claim to be a midwife
or some shit.

11:07.083 --> 11:08.750
It was a doula.

11:08.750 --> 11:11.250
You know what, guys?
Let's just take
a breath, okay?

11:11.250 --> 11:13.708
Adam, we have given you
a chance to express

11:13.708 --> 11:15.583
what some of your issues
with Caroline are.

11:15.583 --> 11:18.083
So, why don't we now
take a moment to hear
Caroline?

11:18.083 --> 11:20.583
You are doing
really good.

11:20.583 --> 11:23.041
Thank you.
I feel good about it,
but it's too soon to say.

11:23.041 --> 11:26.083
Okay, first I want to say, Adam,
that I love you very much.

11:26.083 --> 11:28.083
- Oh.
- However...

11:28.083 --> 11:30.959
it really upsets me
that he thinks of me

11:30.959 --> 11:33.583
as this insane,
dependent nightmare

11:33.583 --> 11:35.041
because he knows
how hard

11:35.041 --> 11:37.250
I have been trying
to get my stuff together.

11:37.250 --> 11:39.708
Things fell apart
because of bad luck
and you're the victim again,

11:39.708 --> 11:42.166
- but next year--
- Yes, yes, I am cursed
with bad luck.

11:42.166 --> 11:44.041
- I am sorry that
that upsets you so much.
- Over and over.

11:44.041 --> 11:46.750
Just get a normal job
and an apartment like
everybody else

11:46.750 --> 11:48.083
and stop bloodsucking.

11:48.083 --> 11:50.542
He's been angry
like this always at me.

11:50.542 --> 11:52.792
Yeah, yeah.
I know, I know.

11:55.291 --> 11:57.458
I think it is
possibly because

11:57.458 --> 12:01.166
he is internally battling
a sexual desire for me.

12:01.166 --> 12:03.125
Holy dogshit!

12:03.125 --> 12:05.333
That's a weird one.
That's a weird one for me.

12:05.333 --> 12:08.750
I'm sorry, guys.
It doesn't take
a psychiatrist

12:08.750 --> 12:11.333
to correlate Adam's
romantic interest in you

12:11.333 --> 12:13.458
with a repressed
fantasy toward me.

12:13.458 --> 12:14.959
I don't want
to fuck my sister.

12:14.959 --> 12:16.083
No one
is saying you do.

12:16.083 --> 12:17.792
( stomps foot )
Caroline just did.

12:17.792 --> 12:19.417
That is true,
and, Caroline,

12:19.417 --> 12:21.291
that goes in the category
of things we should never

12:21.291 --> 12:22.750
say out loud ever,
no matter what.

12:22.750 --> 12:25.500
This is what she does.
She finds a way to drive
a wedge between people

12:25.500 --> 12:27.041
so everybody ends up
just as unhappy as she is.

12:27.041 --> 12:28.625
I know, I know.
I don't want a wedge
between us.

12:28.625 --> 12:30.125
- She's sick in the brain.
- You're sick!

12:30.125 --> 12:32.417
You're sick in the brain!
You're sick-- ( screaming )

12:32.417 --> 12:34.041
Hannah:
Stop it, you guys!

12:34.041 --> 12:35.959
Please stop!

12:35.959 --> 12:39.333
- Please! Hey! Hey!
- Aha.

12:39.333 --> 12:41.458
Hey, T.O.!
You're nuts!

12:41.458 --> 12:42.959
( laughs )

12:42.959 --> 12:44.917
I do not understand
why you can't

12:44.917 --> 12:47.750
be a little bit better
to each other.

12:47.750 --> 12:50.500
Being an only child
is extremely lonely.

12:50.500 --> 12:53.166
All I wanted as a kid
was a sibling.

12:53.166 --> 12:54.333
Caroline, come on,
you don't think

12:54.333 --> 12:57.000
your brother wants
to have sex with you.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.125
No, not
in a physical way, no.

12:59.125 --> 13:02.583
See, it was all
a big misunderstanding,
all right?

13:02.583 --> 13:05.291
So can't you just tell
your sister you love her?

13:07.834 --> 13:10.208
Yeah, I do.
Whatever.

13:10.208 --> 13:13.166
Feliz cumpleaños.
Great!

13:13.166 --> 13:15.542
Okay, you just
make me crazy.

13:17.542 --> 13:20.125
I know I do.

13:20.125 --> 13:22.583
I'm sorry.

13:22.583 --> 13:25.166
- Sorry I yelled at you.
- ( phone chiming )

13:25.166 --> 13:26.708
Hold on one second, guys.
I'm sorry.

13:26.708 --> 13:28.166
I'm just gonna
put this on sil--

13:28.166 --> 13:30.208
okay, I'm sorry,
I have to take this.

13:30.208 --> 13:31.834
Marn, I can't talk
right now.

13:31.834 --> 13:33.917
So, I went out this morning
to get a muffin

13:33.917 --> 13:37.875
and I saw this teenager
giving away kittens
from his backpack.

13:37.875 --> 13:40.333
And so I took
the cutest one.

13:40.333 --> 13:41.875
You have to come over
and see it.

13:41.875 --> 13:44.208
I'm sorry.
I really-- I can't.

13:44.208 --> 13:46.208
You never can, Hannah.
Why?

13:46.208 --> 13:48.708
Well, I'm sorry.
We're having a very real
moment over here.

13:48.708 --> 13:51.792
Fine, don't come see
the cutest thing that's
ever lived.

13:51.792 --> 13:53.417
Good-bye.

13:55.583 --> 13:57.875
- ( purring )
- You're my best friend.

13:57.875 --> 13:58.917
( meows )

13:58.917 --> 14:02.417
- ( whistle blows )
- ( horns honking )

14:15.417 --> 14:18.125
- ( hawking )
- ( doors open )

14:18.917 --> 14:20.250
- Hannah.
- Hi.

14:20.250 --> 14:22.417
I had Mo read
a couple of chapters
last night and he loved them.

14:22.417 --> 14:24.083
- Loved them.
- That's what I said.

14:24.083 --> 14:27.458
So I read a bit this morning
and I get you, Hannah Horvath.

14:27.458 --> 14:29.166
- And I like you.
- I knew she would.

14:29.166 --> 14:30.959
Thank you so much.

14:30.959 --> 14:33.125
You're like a Mindy Kaling
meets, um...

14:33.125 --> 14:35.708
- Joan Didion.
- No, Mo.

14:35.708 --> 14:37.250
Well, I love Mindy Kaling.
She's terrific.

14:37.250 --> 14:38.750
Right,
but she holds back.

14:38.750 --> 14:41.917
I mean, she'll go there,
but she doesn't go
all the way there,

14:41.917 --> 14:43.291
you know what I mean?

14:43.291 --> 14:46.000
I definitely do.
She just never, um--
she never takes it there.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.208
You take it there
and then you take it
even further

14:49.208 --> 14:53.041
and I'm just like,
"Whoa, how the fuck
did we get here?"

14:53.041 --> 14:56.166
Mindy Kaling's not
writing about choking
on long balls, so...

14:56.166 --> 14:58.208
- ( laughs )
- Well, neither am I.

14:58.208 --> 15:01.625
You wish, Mo.
Anyway, the book
obviously needs some work.

15:01.625 --> 15:03.166
It's not as tight
as it can be,

15:03.166 --> 15:04.875
but I really think
we can get it there.

15:04.875 --> 15:07.625
So, who is Hannah Horvath?

15:07.625 --> 15:10.959
Uh, I am.
I write my own books
and I'm not a--

15:10.959 --> 15:12.333
Right, no, but beyond
these pages.

15:12.333 --> 15:14.125
I want to know more.
Who are we selling?

15:14.125 --> 15:15.667
How would you
describe yourself?

15:15.667 --> 15:17.125
What's your brand?

15:17.125 --> 15:19.166
- Good question, Mo.
- Thank you.

15:19.166 --> 15:21.917
Okay, let's see.
My brand.

15:21.917 --> 15:23.375
Well, I'm from the Midwest,

15:23.375 --> 15:26.625
so I will always be
15 to 45 pounds overweight,

15:26.625 --> 15:28.166
depending how far
I live from the coast.

15:28.166 --> 15:29.875
( both laughing )

15:29.875 --> 15:32.375
The farther I am
from the coast,
the fatter I am.

15:32.375 --> 15:34.250
( laughing )

15:34.250 --> 15:37.333
So, I guess my brand
is Tombstone Pizza.

15:37.333 --> 15:39.834
( laughing )

15:39.834 --> 15:43.500
Uh, let's see.
Um, I--

15:43.500 --> 15:46.750
I feel like I'm a person
who just, like, can't keep
my mouth shut.

15:46.750 --> 15:49.291
I mean, there's things
that you only talk about
with your friends.

15:49.291 --> 15:51.375
Those things
I'll talk about
with anyone.

15:51.375 --> 15:53.000
- I don't believe in secrets.
- Right, TMI all the time.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.750
You're like Kathy Griffin
on truth serum.

15:54.750 --> 15:56.375
Well, I don't know.
Kathy Griffin's not exactly--

15:56.375 --> 15:59.792
What the fuck
is truth serum, Mo?

15:59.792 --> 16:02.667
Well, I'm sold,
but here's the thing
about our company.

16:02.667 --> 16:04.041
We don't do e-books.

16:04.041 --> 16:05.792
Well, maybe
you should start.

16:05.792 --> 16:09.959
Nope, so we'd
want to put it out
as an actual book.

16:09.959 --> 16:11.375
You know,
that you can hold,

16:11.375 --> 16:12.875
buy in a store,
that kind of thing.

16:12.875 --> 16:14.542
I hope that's
okay with you.

16:16.125 --> 16:17.750
Are you kidding me?

16:17.750 --> 16:19.875
I mean, that's
the best thing
I've ever heard.

16:19.875 --> 16:21.750
I just said yes
to an e-book

16:21.750 --> 16:23.792
because it was better
than, like, a "no book."

16:23.792 --> 16:26.291
( both laughing )

16:26.291 --> 16:28.542
( screaming )

16:29.875 --> 16:32.041
- That's exciting.
- Sorry.

16:33.708 --> 16:36.250
You guys laugh too much.
I don't even care.

16:36.250 --> 16:39.583
( laughing )

16:39.583 --> 16:43.083
I'm sorry.
That's so good.

16:45.208 --> 16:48.375
- Okay, Mo.
- I'm so-- I'm sorry.

16:50.542 --> 16:52.750
( knock on door )

16:52.750 --> 16:55.125
Hey, what's up?

16:55.125 --> 16:57.667
Hey.
What are you wearing?

16:57.667 --> 16:59.375
I'm heading
to play ball.

16:59.375 --> 17:00.917
You play basketball?

17:00.917 --> 17:03.417
Yeah, what do you
think I do?

17:03.417 --> 17:05.500
I don't know,
read, eat soup,

17:05.500 --> 17:09.125
write letters of complaint
to local businesses?

17:09.125 --> 17:10.416
Won't you come in?

17:10.416 --> 17:12.666
Wow, Ray,
this place is huge.

17:12.666 --> 17:16.625
Yeah, well,
it's not exactly Versailles,
but it works for me.

17:16.625 --> 17:19.416
Yeah, it's not half as bad
as Hannah said it was.

17:19.416 --> 17:22.250
No, it was.
Believe me, it was
a real house of horrors.

17:22.250 --> 17:23.416
Yeah.

17:23.416 --> 17:25.083
I'm kind of surprised
you live in such a nice place.

17:25.083 --> 17:26.125
No offense.

17:26.125 --> 17:27.583
I could never live
all the way out here, though.

17:27.583 --> 17:30.708
Once you go to Manhattan,
it's kind of hard to go
back to Brooklyn.

17:30.708 --> 17:33.000
Well, sounds like you know
what you're doing to me.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.667
Totally, thank you.

17:34.667 --> 17:36.291
Yeah.

17:36.291 --> 17:38.125
( sighs )

17:38.125 --> 17:39.750
- So...
- Yeah?

17:39.750 --> 17:41.792
I'm on pins and needles
here, Marn.

17:41.792 --> 17:43.667
What did you want
to talk about?

17:45.458 --> 17:48.667
Yeah, so I guess
I just wanted you to, um...

17:50.583 --> 17:52.792
God, I don't really know
how to say this.

17:52.792 --> 17:54.708
Um...

17:54.708 --> 17:57.625
I wanted you to tell me
what's wrong with me.

17:58.792 --> 18:00.792
- What's wrong with you?
- Yes.

18:00.792 --> 18:02.250
It just feels like
it's time for me

18:02.250 --> 18:06.000
to take responsibility
for what has happened
in my life,

18:06.000 --> 18:08.625
and you are someone
who likes to tell people

18:08.625 --> 18:10.417
what's wrong
with them anyway,

18:10.417 --> 18:12.041
so, shoot.

18:14.041 --> 18:15.792
I'm smelling
a trap here.

18:15.792 --> 18:17.166
No, it is not a trap.

18:17.166 --> 18:19.333
Seriously,
this is what I need.

18:19.333 --> 18:22.500
From you,
specifically, please.

18:22.500 --> 18:24.166
So, just give it to me.

18:25.291 --> 18:27.000
- Please.
- Okay.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.917
- Okay.
- All right.

18:28.917 --> 18:30.417
You ready for this?

18:30.417 --> 18:31.834
Yes, I am a strong woman.

18:31.834 --> 18:34.333
All right,
let's see here.

18:34.333 --> 18:36.917
Hmm, well,
for beginners,

18:36.917 --> 18:39.000
you're extremely
judgmental.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.625
What?

18:40.625 --> 18:44.333
Yeah, you came in here
and immediately insulted me
and my neighborhood.

18:44.333 --> 18:45.667
Those were funny jokes.

18:45.667 --> 18:47.333
Were they? Were they
funny jokes, Marn?

18:47.333 --> 18:49.542
- Well--
- You come across like
you're better than everyone

18:49.542 --> 18:51.083
and you want no part
of their lives,

18:51.083 --> 18:52.542
and then when you're
excluded from things,

18:52.542 --> 18:55.708
you're outrageously offended
and hold onto this grudge.

18:55.708 --> 18:57.708
Also you're
unbearably uptight.

18:57.708 --> 19:00.250
Okay, who isn't uptight,
really?

19:00.250 --> 19:01.917
If we're being serious.

19:04.166 --> 19:05.542
And you use people.

19:05.542 --> 19:06.875
- No.
- You use people a lot.

19:06.875 --> 19:08.291
- No.
- Yeah, you do.

19:08.291 --> 19:10.875
So much so that even
when you try to connect
and be sincere,

19:10.875 --> 19:12.417
it comes across as phony.

19:12.417 --> 19:15.083
I think that actually
more or less sums it up
in a nutshell.

19:15.083 --> 19:17.583
You're a huge,
fat fucking phony.

19:21.458 --> 19:24.083
Wow.

19:24.083 --> 19:25.583
Okay, yeah, thanks.

19:25.583 --> 19:28.917
I'm super glad I came here.
That was great.

19:28.917 --> 19:30.166
Yeah.

19:30.166 --> 19:32.417
Fuck.

19:32.417 --> 19:35.083
( groans )

19:35.083 --> 19:39.250
But, that being said,
I still like you.

19:39.250 --> 19:41.250
Why?

19:41.250 --> 19:44.875
Because-- because
behind it all,

19:44.875 --> 19:46.250
I think
you mean well.

19:46.250 --> 19:49.583
And I'm old enough
to recognize that
all of this bullshit

19:49.583 --> 19:53.208
comes from a very deep,
dank, dark, toxic well
of insecurity,

19:53.208 --> 19:55.166
probably created
by your absent father.

19:55.166 --> 19:58.125
And that allows you to be
a sympathetic character.

19:59.250 --> 20:01.291
That's nice.

20:03.125 --> 20:05.625
Look...

20:05.625 --> 20:08.583
you are, ultimately,
a good person, Marnie.

20:08.583 --> 20:11.458
Okay?
I believe that.

20:12.583 --> 20:14.125
Thank you.

20:14.125 --> 20:16.291
You're welcome.

20:16.291 --> 20:18.000
You want a hug?

20:19.625 --> 20:21.834
Come on.
Give me a hug.

20:27.083 --> 20:30.417
Maybe I went
a little too far.
I'm sorry.

20:30.417 --> 20:32.458
It's okay.

20:51.542 --> 20:54.500
Take these off.
Take these off.

20:54.500 --> 20:55.583
Take them down.

20:55.583 --> 20:58.500
Oh, fuck, how many
pairs of underwear
do you wear?

21:00.708 --> 21:02.875
( phone chiming )

21:04.417 --> 21:06.667
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi, hi, honey.

21:06.667 --> 21:08.000
( giggles )
What's going on?

21:08.000 --> 21:12.333
Oh, nothing,
just taking the day off
to soak up some rays.

21:12.333 --> 21:14.583
Well, also,
I had a small procedure.

21:14.583 --> 21:16.333
Nothing to worry about.
Are you--

21:16.333 --> 21:17.750
Okay, I just met
with a publisher

21:17.750 --> 21:20.458
and they want to give me
a real book deal.

21:20.458 --> 21:23.750
Not a stupid, pathetic,
shitty e-book deal,

21:23.750 --> 21:25.708
a real book deal.

21:25.708 --> 21:29.834
Well, that is--
that's great, love bug.

21:29.834 --> 21:31.834
Are you okay?
Why aren't you more excited?

21:31.834 --> 21:33.792
Uh, well, to be honest,
you know,

21:33.792 --> 21:35.875
I just got off the phone
with Cousin Rudy,

21:35.875 --> 21:40.375
and he looked at that contract
like you wanted him to,

21:40.375 --> 21:43.166
and it seems
that your old publishers

21:43.166 --> 21:46.041
own the rights to your book
since they paid you.

21:46.041 --> 21:48.166
No, they were
very, very clear
about the fact

21:48.166 --> 21:49.708
that they're definitely
not publishing the book.

21:49.708 --> 21:52.458
Well, Rudy called
and spoke with someone
over at the Millstreet,

21:52.458 --> 21:54.208
and apparently they don't
release the rights

21:54.208 --> 21:58.000
on any of the books
they acquire for, like--
for three years.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.333
Dad, that's insane.

21:59.333 --> 22:00.834
You're not making
any sense, okay?

22:00.834 --> 22:03.250
You're, like, loopy
from your procedure
or whatever.

22:03.250 --> 22:07.291
- Small mole on my--
- Plus, Rudy is not even
a real lawyer, okay?

22:07.291 --> 22:09.917
He's like a Subway Sandwiches
franchise lawyer.

22:09.917 --> 22:12.125
Now, let's not go
and insult Cousin Rudy.

22:12.125 --> 22:16.125
- He took the time to--
- Rudy represents sandwiches,
not art, okay?

22:16.125 --> 22:19.583
If a pepperoni sub
is ever suing a tuna salad
sandwich,

22:19.583 --> 22:21.542
let's call Cousin Rudy.

22:21.542 --> 22:22.959
Well, I think you should
call Cousin Rudy

22:22.959 --> 22:25.500
and talk all this over
with him.

22:25.500 --> 22:26.917
And it sounds like,
in three years,

22:26.917 --> 22:29.041
you'll be able to do
whatever you want
with that book.

22:29.041 --> 22:30.917
Three years?

22:30.917 --> 22:33.542
Three years might as well
be a million years.

22:33.542 --> 22:35.959
Well, we tried
three years for you.

22:35.959 --> 22:38.917
Well, you're insane
and I have to go.

22:53.375 --> 22:56.083
I should really get going.
I have this lunch thing.

22:56.083 --> 22:57.750
Yeah, ahem, I should
get going, too.

22:57.750 --> 22:59.834
- I run point--
- Oh.

22:59.834 --> 23:01.166
point guard
on the court,

23:01.166 --> 23:02.834
so I don't want to keep
the fellas waiting.

23:02.834 --> 23:05.125
Mm-mm, you can't
do that.

23:05.125 --> 23:07.375
- No.
- ( laughs ) No.

23:07.375 --> 23:09.208
Should I wait for you?

23:09.208 --> 23:11.375
No, you go ahead.
No, I'll wait here.

23:11.375 --> 23:13.041
You go... so...

23:13.041 --> 23:14.750
Hey, um...

23:15.792 --> 23:18.500
thanks for talking to me.

23:18.500 --> 23:21.291
That was really helpful
when you talked to me.

23:21.291 --> 23:23.458
Yeah, yeah.
No, of course.

23:23.458 --> 23:25.250
I'm glad it was helpful.

23:25.250 --> 23:27.458
Nice to know
I could be of service.

23:31.083 --> 23:33.667
Okay, so...

23:33.667 --> 23:37.583
yeah, so, be safe
and stay warm.

23:37.583 --> 23:38.875
You know, maybe
for the time being,

23:38.875 --> 23:41.834
it might be best
to keep this on the DL,

23:41.834 --> 23:43.875
the down low.

23:43.875 --> 23:45.291
You know?

23:45.291 --> 23:46.875
Go fuck yourself.

23:46.875 --> 23:49.208
Like I'd advertise this.

23:52.583 --> 23:54.000
Okay.

23:58.125 --> 24:01.500
"Miss Horvath,
pursuant to our agreement
of July 18th, 2012,

24:01.500 --> 24:04.375
the exclusive
rights to your e-book
are nontransferable

24:04.375 --> 24:06.250
and remain the property
of Millstreet Press

24:06.250 --> 24:09.417
and all relevant subsidiary
divisions for three years,

24:09.417 --> 24:12.166
effective the date
of signing."

24:12.166 --> 24:15.125
I am so sorry.
You poor thing.

24:15.125 --> 24:18.667
- Oh.
- This is the worst thing
that's ever happened to me.

24:18.667 --> 24:20.959
( sighs )
Listen. Listen to me.

24:20.959 --> 24:23.667
You wrote all
of those wonderful stories

24:23.667 --> 24:25.291
and now you know
you can do it.

24:25.291 --> 24:26.959
You just have to write
a whole new bunch

24:26.959 --> 24:29.250
of wonderful stories,
that's all.

24:30.834 --> 24:31.834
Blech.

24:31.834 --> 24:34.542
"A whole new bunch
of wonderful stories"?

24:34.542 --> 24:35.959
My whole life
was in that book.

24:35.959 --> 24:38.125
Everything that's
ever happened to me, okay?

24:38.125 --> 24:39.542
The hand job kidney stone.

24:39.542 --> 24:41.542
The time I fell asleep
on a pile of pizza boxes.

24:41.542 --> 24:42.959
When I made out
with the Cuban refugee,

24:42.959 --> 24:44.917
then the thing happened
with the glitter pens.

24:44.917 --> 24:46.708
All of it's in there!

24:46.708 --> 24:49.542
And now what am I gonna do,
live another 25 years

24:49.542 --> 24:50.917
just to create
a body of work

24:50.917 --> 24:54.667
that matches the one
that they stole from me?

24:54.667 --> 24:57.208
What if nothing happens
in the next 25 years?

24:57.208 --> 24:59.000
What if I'm still living
in this apartment

24:59.000 --> 25:00.625
wondering
if there's asbestos?

25:00.625 --> 25:02.166
What will I write
about then?

25:02.166 --> 25:04.792
Why are they
doing this to me?

25:04.792 --> 25:06.500
I know how you feel.

25:06.500 --> 25:09.291
I really do.
Listen.

25:11.583 --> 25:13.208
When I was
in the eighth grade,

25:13.208 --> 25:15.792
they came to shoot
"Independence Day"
in my hometown,

25:15.792 --> 25:18.625
and I got an audition
for the part of
Alicia Casse.

25:18.625 --> 25:21.375
- Mm-hmm.
- By all accounts,
I was fabulous.

25:21.375 --> 25:23.792
I mean, the part
was tailor-made for me.

25:23.792 --> 25:26.417
They gave it
to somebody else,
but in that moment,

25:26.417 --> 25:28.917
I was certain
that my acting career

25:28.917 --> 25:32.083
was finished,
you know, forever.

25:32.083 --> 25:34.542
Caroline, that has
absolutely nothing

25:34.542 --> 25:36.458
to do with what
we're talking about,

25:36.458 --> 25:39.250
and your acting career
is  over.

25:40.959 --> 25:42.250
( pounds table )
Where's Adam?

25:42.250 --> 25:44.417
You know, he should
be here for you right now.

25:44.417 --> 25:45.708
Mm-mm.

25:45.708 --> 25:46.959
No, he shouldn't.

25:46.959 --> 25:48.208
He has his own things
going on.

25:48.208 --> 25:49.625
No, don't you see,
Hannah?

25:49.625 --> 25:51.208
This is his
modus operandi.

25:51.208 --> 25:53.000
When times are sunny,
oh, there's Adam.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.917
But when the great seesaw
of life throws your cunt
in a sandbox,

25:55.917 --> 25:57.583
he's a ghost,
nowhere to be found.

25:57.583 --> 25:58.959
This is what he does.

25:58.959 --> 26:01.458
- Hey, Caroline?
- Yeah, honey?

26:01.458 --> 26:03.375
- Can you do me a favor?
- Anything.

26:03.375 --> 26:06.583
Can you try
shutting the fuck up?

26:10.250 --> 26:12.500
Listen, I feel your pain.
I really do.

26:12.500 --> 26:15.000
But, honey, I think
you're projecting
a little bit.

26:15.000 --> 26:18.041
You feel my pain?
How do you feel anyone's pain?

26:18.041 --> 26:20.708
All you do is talk
and talk and talk
and talk.

26:20.708 --> 26:23.500
And every time I come home
to my apartment,

26:23.500 --> 26:24.792
you're just here talking.

26:24.792 --> 26:26.458
And at first
it was kind of fun,

26:26.458 --> 26:28.250
but now I'm getting
pretty fucking sick

26:28.250 --> 26:29.792
of listening
to your mouth run.

26:29.792 --> 26:32.333
Just--
( imitates retching )

26:32.333 --> 26:34.875
I'll go to my room,
give you a little space.

26:34.875 --> 26:37.583
It's not your room,
it's my room.

26:37.583 --> 26:38.875
The whole apartment's mine,

26:38.875 --> 26:41.208
and for the low, low price
of $2,100 a month,

26:41.208 --> 26:43.667
it could be yours,
but it isn't.

26:43.667 --> 26:46.750
Well, what would you
like for me to do,
Hannah?

26:46.750 --> 26:48.667
Hmm, let me
think about it.

26:48.667 --> 26:53.625
I'd really like you
to get the fuck out
of my apartment!

26:56.333 --> 26:58.125
Fucking selfish
little whore.

26:58.125 --> 26:59.500
You and my brother
deserve one other,

26:59.500 --> 27:00.959
you know that,
you selfish little pricks?

27:00.959 --> 27:02.417
And you will never
write a thing that matters

27:02.417 --> 27:04.959
because you will never
understand the true struggles
of humanity

27:04.959 --> 27:07.542
because you
just slipped right out
of your mother's pussy

27:07.542 --> 27:09.083
like a nice little
golden egg,

27:09.083 --> 27:11.375
you spoiled
little fucking brat.

27:12.875 --> 27:14.417
Man on TV:
I actually suffer and--

27:14.417 --> 27:17.000
and still continue
to suffer from acne.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.834
( footsteps approaching )

27:19.667 --> 27:21.583
( panting )
Hey.

27:28.041 --> 27:29.667
Hey.

27:33.542 --> 27:35.208
What's up?

27:40.708 --> 27:42.250
Where's Caroline?

27:42.250 --> 27:44.917
I kicked her out.

27:48.208 --> 27:50.750
What?
Why?

27:50.750 --> 27:52.500
Uh, 'cause she was
ruining our lives

27:52.500 --> 27:55.750
and I thought it would
make you happy, finally.

27:55.750 --> 27:57.792
Well, what happened?

27:57.792 --> 27:59.917
- Where'd she go?
- I don't know.

27:59.917 --> 28:01.583
- Hannah?
- I don't know.

28:01.583 --> 28:02.750
What did you do?

28:02.750 --> 28:04.917
I'm supposed to be
taking care of her.

28:04.917 --> 28:07.166
Well, you didn't like
doing that, so...

28:07.166 --> 28:10.250
Yeah, so?
She's my sister.

28:10.250 --> 28:12.750
Do you understand that?
What the fuck?

28:20.500 --> 28:22.125
