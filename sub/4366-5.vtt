00:01.730 --> 00:03.340
You are being watched.

00:04.090 --> 00:06.280
The government has a secret system.

00:06.340 --> 00:07.480
A machine.

00:07.490 --> 00:10.170
It spies on you every hour of every day.

00:10.740 --> 00:13.090
I know because I built it.

00:13.310 --> 00:15.580
I designed the machine to detect acts of terror,

00:15.580 --> 00:17.360
But it sees everything.

00:17.490 --> 00:20.220
Violent crimes involving ordinary people.

00:20.220 --> 00:21.450
People like you.

00:21.700 --> 00:24.490
Crimes the government considered irrelevant.

00:25.390 --> 00:27.960
They wouldn't act so I decided I would.

00:28.840 --> 00:30.530
But I needed a partner.

00:30.680 --> 00:33.040
Someone with the skills to intervene.

00:33.280 --> 00:35.220
Hunted by the authorities,

00:35.820 --> 00:37.490
We work in secret.

00:37.490 --> 00:39.190
You will never find us.

00:39.250 --> 00:41.460
But victim or perpetrator,

00:41.460 --> 00:42.830
If your number's up,

00:42.940 --> 00:44.430
We'll find you.

00:46.000 --> 00:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:05.550 --> 01:06.450
Yeah?

01:06.450 --> 01:07.920
We've got a problem.

01:24.060 --> 01:25.180
What's good here?

01:26.830 --> 01:28.570
That won't work, Mr. Reese.

01:28.580 --> 01:29.450
What won't?

01:29.450 --> 01:31.690
Your interrogation technique.

01:31.700 --> 01:33.030
What's good here?

01:33.590 --> 01:35.300
It's an innocent question.

01:35.360 --> 01:37.560
No question is ever innocent from you.

01:37.790 --> 01:40.310
You're trying to determine whether I come here often.

01:40.310 --> 01:41.420
Armed with that knowledge,

01:41.420 --> 01:43.320
you'll try to figure out where I live.

01:43.600 --> 01:45.150
You're paranoid, Finch.

01:45.150 --> 01:46.510
With good reason.

01:49.600 --> 01:51.980
Maybe I just don't know what's good here

01:52.130 --> 01:54.030
So I'm asking the regular.

02:01.860 --> 02:03.760
Enjoy your meal, Mr. Reese.

02:12.980 --> 02:14.610
Samuel Gates.

02:15.390 --> 02:17.150
The next number on your list.

02:17.150 --> 02:18.320
Bus is here!

02:20.540 --> 02:22.330
So what do we have on him?

02:25.160 --> 02:26.680
Born in south Boston.

02:26.680 --> 02:28.210
Law degree from NYU.

02:28.210 --> 02:31.320
He lives on the upper west side with his son, Sam.

02:31.700 --> 02:32.780
Where's the wife?

02:32.780 --> 02:34.870
She died last year.

02:34.930 --> 02:36.800
Any chance Gates was involved?

02:36.800 --> 02:39.010
Not unless he found a way to give her cancer.

02:39.020 --> 02:41.690
Elizabeth Gates was diagnosed

02:41.690 --> 02:43.970
with an inoperable brain tumor last April.

02:43.980 --> 02:45.550
By November she was gone.

02:45.550 --> 02:47.250
So the son is all he has left.

02:47.260 --> 02:49.160
- Wait! - Oh, don't forget your lunch.

02:51.140 --> 02:52.660
What do we know about the nanny?

02:52.660 --> 02:54.650
Christina Rojas.

02:55.280 --> 02:57.210
Gates hired her when his wife fell ill.

02:57.210 --> 02:58.600
The kid sure likes her.

02:58.600 --> 03:00.410
She spends a lot of time with him.

03:00.420 --> 03:01.980
Judging by the hours she's billing,

03:01.980 --> 03:05.500
I'd say Gates was putting in long days at the office.

03:05.580 --> 03:07.220
He lost the woman he loved.

03:07.470 --> 03:09.920
Probably threw himself into his work to cope.

03:10.350 --> 03:11.620
Where's his office?

03:11.620 --> 03:13.260
Criminal court, city of New York.

03:13.260 --> 03:14.840
Which may explain why the machine

03:14.840 --> 03:16.710
has sent us his social.

03:18.070 --> 03:19.570
Absolutely not.

03:19.570 --> 03:21.990
This is direct evidence, properly obtained.

03:21.990 --> 03:24.840
So odds are he's the victim, not the perpetrator.

03:24.840 --> 03:26.660
Judges get plenty of death threats.

03:26.660 --> 03:28.760
It doesn't pass the balancing test, your honor.

03:28.760 --> 03:30.100
The probative value is--

03:30.110 --> 03:32.090
I know what the balancing test is, counselor.

03:32.090 --> 03:34.100
Gates gets more death threats than most.

03:34.100 --> 03:35.260
Word at the courthouse is

03:35.270 --> 03:37.100
He's waging a one-man war on crime--

03:37.100 --> 03:40.010
Tough, by-the-book, making lots of enemies.

03:40.010 --> 03:43.320
If video of the actual crime is unfairly prejudicial,

03:43.320 --> 03:45.190
I think we might have to give up

03:45.190 --> 03:48.280
on the entire concept of trial by jury.

03:48.930 --> 03:50.030
The video's in.

03:51.990 --> 03:53.220
Everyone has enemies.

03:53.220 --> 03:56.430
The machine identifies malice and an intent to harm.

03:56.430 --> 03:58.160
We need to determine which threat it saw,

03:58.160 --> 03:59.820
Which one is real.

03:59.820 --> 04:00.940
Until we know,

04:00.950 --> 04:02.930
my best bet is to stay close to Gates,

04:02.930 --> 04:05.090
In case somebody makes a move.

04:17.350 --> 04:20.120
Looks like he's got quite a collection of enemies.

04:25.010 --> 04:27.110
Mr. Reese, any sign of a threat?

04:28.730 --> 04:30.230
Does cholesterol count?

04:30.230 --> 04:32.810
I'm nearly done analyzing the threatening letters.

04:32.970 --> 04:34.930
There are nine that I still can't source,

04:34.930 --> 04:39.070
But I've identified six possible suspects.

04:39.330 --> 04:41.660
Any of them white guys with crew cuts?

04:41.730 --> 04:43.220
Not that I'm aware of.

05:27.020 --> 05:28.900
Finch, what's the son's name again?

05:28.900 --> 05:30.690
Samuel Gates, Junior.

05:31.530 --> 05:32.370
Why?

05:32.370 --> 05:34.980
I think we've been following the wrong Sam Gates.

05:43.440 --> 05:44.390
Hey, Christina.

05:44.390 --> 05:45.210
You're not going to believe

05:45.220 --> 05:47.550
what Mark C. Said to Mrs. Kizer today.

06:25.760 --> 06:29.100
I can't be there on time if I'm getting bad information.

06:29.100 --> 06:31.160
The machine did not send us the wrong number.

06:31.160 --> 06:33.610
If it says that judge Gates is in danger, then he is.

06:33.610 --> 06:35.160
Well, tell that to his son.

06:35.160 --> 06:36.690
The kidnapping must connect.

06:36.690 --> 06:39.290
It could be the first step in a larger plot

06:39.290 --> 06:40.870
That ends with the judge dead.

06:41.930 --> 06:43.850
We can still put a stop to it, all of it.

06:43.850 --> 06:45.140
But we need a plan.

06:45.190 --> 06:46.490
I have a plan.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.080
Find Sam.

06:48.410 --> 06:50.260
The man just lost his wife.

06:50.270 --> 06:52.210
I won't let him wind up alone.

06:58.690 --> 06:59.700
Judge Gates.

06:59.750 --> 07:00.940
- Dad? - Hey, Sam.

07:00.940 --> 07:02.060
Dad...

07:03.790 --> 07:04.440
What's wrong?

07:04.450 --> 07:06.680
He's fine, your honor... for now.

07:06.690 --> 07:07.780
Who are you?

07:08.270 --> 07:09.150
Where is my son?

07:09.150 --> 07:10.890
No cops, no feds.

07:10.890 --> 07:12.850
Tell anyone and he's dead.

07:13.060 --> 07:15.230
Keep quiet and you'll hear from us tonight.

07:15.610 --> 07:19.600
Wait, look... we can handle this ourselves.

07:19.730 --> 07:21.490
Just tell me what you want.

07:31.780 --> 07:33.740
This is Sam, leave a message.

07:35.700 --> 07:37.790
Hi, uh, Christina, this is Judge Gates.

07:37.790 --> 07:39.990
Please! Call me back.

07:39.990 --> 07:44.020
Hi, uh, this is Judge Gates. Is Sam there with Daniel?

07:44.020 --> 07:46.650
No, is everything okay?

07:52.780 --> 07:53.910
Oh, god.

08:03.260 --> 08:05.940
Let's figure out how we get your son back.

08:07.940 --> 08:08.960
Who are you?

08:09.370 --> 08:10.910
I'm here to help you.

08:11.620 --> 08:12.700
Where is Sam?

08:12.860 --> 08:14.010
Where is my son?

08:15.610 --> 08:16.750
You're with the kidnappers, aren't you?

08:16.750 --> 08:17.620
You're one of them.

08:17.630 --> 08:19.900
No, I tried to stop them.

08:20.260 --> 08:21.930
But the kidnappers made contact.

08:21.930 --> 08:23.080
That's good.

08:23.080 --> 08:25.170
That means they want to negotiate.

08:25.190 --> 08:28.160
They won't hurt your son as long as he's worth something.

08:28.420 --> 08:30.330
What do you mean, you tried to stop them?

08:30.450 --> 08:31.350
You were there?

08:31.350 --> 08:32.390
I was.

08:32.419 --> 08:33.750
But not soon enough.

08:33.750 --> 08:35.710
How did you know they were going to take him?

08:36.150 --> 08:37.179
Who the hell are you?

08:37.179 --> 08:39.150
You have two questions right now:

08:39.150 --> 08:41.330
Who are you and where is my son?

08:41.330 --> 08:43.280
Which one do you want to focus on?

08:56.540 --> 08:57.980
They were in my house.

08:58.930 --> 09:00.300
How'd they get past the alarm?

09:00.310 --> 09:01.760
I've tapped your phone

09:01.800 --> 09:04.100
and I'm setting up surveillance on your street.

09:04.300 --> 09:06.340
It's our best shot at IDing the kidnappers.

09:06.350 --> 09:07.610
Where's Christina?

09:07.660 --> 09:09.540
She was supposed to be here when he got home.

09:09.540 --> 09:10.900
I didn't see her.

09:12.250 --> 09:13.800
Could she be in on it?

09:14.500 --> 09:15.750
That's impossible.

09:16.740 --> 09:17.990
She loved Sam.

09:25.090 --> 09:26.160
Judge...

09:27.210 --> 09:29.590
Have you received any kidnapping threats?

09:30.050 --> 09:32.400
Tried any cases involving kidnappers?

09:36.310 --> 09:38.950
I have about $300,000 in the bank.

09:39.470 --> 09:42.170
If this is about money, I can pay.

09:42.170 --> 09:45.610
Whatever this is about, I'm going to find your son.

09:46.380 --> 09:47.880
And I'm going to bring him home.

09:48.200 --> 09:50.930
Stay here and wait for the next call.

09:54.630 --> 09:57.120
They said no cops, no FBI.

09:57.280 --> 09:59.140
They didn't say anything about me.

10:05.720 --> 10:06.820
Okay, Finch.

10:06.820 --> 10:08.780
You should have audio on his landline

10:08.780 --> 10:11.200
and video of the street outside Gates' house.

10:11.310 --> 10:12.940
I want to save that boy as much as you do,

10:12.940 --> 10:14.700
but remember, Mr. Reese--

10:15.020 --> 10:16.860
We don't need a judge asking questions

10:16.860 --> 10:18.710
about who we are and what we do.

10:18.720 --> 10:21.270
I can't work a kidnapping from arm's length.

10:21.270 --> 10:24.300
I'll worry about Gates once we get Sam back.

10:24.430 --> 10:25.700
Where are we on the kidnappers?

10:25.700 --> 10:27.250
Any luck tracing their call?

10:27.250 --> 10:28.480
I'm afraid not.

10:28.480 --> 10:31.810
It was voice-over I.P., anonymized through the internet.

10:31.810 --> 10:32.890
what about the other phone?

10:32.890 --> 10:34.540
The one the spotter threw in the trash?

10:34.550 --> 10:36.650
it's a disposable, obviously.

10:36.650 --> 10:38.420
Not much on the sim card.

10:38.430 --> 10:40.930
Some disconnected numbers and a handful of texts,

10:40.930 --> 10:42.550
All equally cryptic.

10:42.550 --> 10:45.920
So I'm trying to hack the cell company

10:45.920 --> 10:47.280
For more information.

10:47.280 --> 10:49.280
But their firewall is impressive.

10:49.280 --> 10:50.690
you can't get in?

10:50.700 --> 10:53.350
You built a machine that spies on the entire country.

10:53.350 --> 10:54.830
when you work for the government,

10:54.830 --> 10:56.750
Access is not a problem.

10:56.750 --> 10:58.220
Things are different now.

10:58.900 --> 11:00.140
I'll figure it out.

11:00.140 --> 11:01.680
Well, figure it out quick.

11:01.680 --> 11:03.460
The kidnappers killed the nanny.

11:03.470 --> 11:06.250
They must have gotten Gates' alarm code out of her.

11:08.440 --> 11:11.200
911 emergency, hello?

11:17.590 --> 11:19.330
- Hey, you seen Carter? - No.

11:40.360 --> 11:41.360
Detective.

11:42.130 --> 11:43.190
Detective.

11:51.830 --> 11:54.520
You came down from the 51st right, Fusco?

11:55.080 --> 11:56.450
The Bronx finest.

11:56.680 --> 11:57.980
What brought you here?

11:57.990 --> 11:59.840
I wanted a change of scenery.

12:00.220 --> 12:01.290
Wanted?

12:01.510 --> 12:02.740
Or needed?

12:05.660 --> 12:07.110
You got something you want to say?

12:07.110 --> 12:09.550
I heard some rumors that got me concerned.

12:14.610 --> 12:16.640
I just like to know what I'm dealing with.

12:21.510 --> 12:23.370
Carter, I'm going to buy you a coffee.

12:24.130 --> 12:25.790
Since you've been so nice.

12:26.680 --> 12:28.180
Cream, no sugar.

12:39.550 --> 12:40.940
Oh, he comes when he's called.

12:40.940 --> 12:41.920
Good.

12:42.370 --> 12:45.280
Now if I could just train you to stop trying to kill me.

12:47.460 --> 12:49.360
How long am I going to have to work down here?

12:49.750 --> 12:51.120
Commute's a bitch.

12:52.300 --> 12:53.790
You should be grateful.

12:54.020 --> 12:56.440
Takes some guys years to make task force.

12:56.670 --> 13:00.210
Plus, I let you live.

13:01.470 --> 13:04.490
Carter, is she getting close?

13:04.630 --> 13:05.540
All I know right now

13:05.540 --> 13:07.360
Is you pissed off real police, my friend.

13:07.360 --> 13:09.340
She's not going to stop till she got you.

13:10.270 --> 13:11.300
Is that it?

13:12.380 --> 13:13.530
Ballistics.

13:14.430 --> 13:15.520
And find out if there's been

13:15.520 --> 13:17.520
Any ransom kidnappings reported.

13:18.380 --> 13:20.300
White guys with crew cuts.

13:20.790 --> 13:22.210
One with long hair.

13:22.390 --> 13:23.350
Kidnapping's big news.

13:23.350 --> 13:24.740
I'd have heard something.

13:25.350 --> 13:26.860
What about amber alerts?

13:26.860 --> 13:27.670
Child abduction?

13:27.670 --> 13:29.200
Is that what we're dealing with?

13:29.360 --> 13:30.320
We?

13:31.670 --> 13:33.190
Since when are you on board?

13:33.190 --> 13:34.720
It's still a missing kid.

13:34.790 --> 13:36.700
Hey, whatever else I've done, I'm still a cop.

13:36.700 --> 13:38.450
If you need some help, you let me know.

13:40.150 --> 13:41.360
You understand?

13:47.660 --> 13:49.420
I cracked the cell company's firewall.

13:49.420 --> 13:51.580
The spotter's phone was purchased with cash

13:51.580 --> 13:52.780
And a phony name.

13:52.780 --> 13:54.890
But our kidnappers have to sleep somewhere.

13:54.890 --> 13:56.420
The location data puts this phone

13:56.420 --> 13:58.740
On the same block in Brooklyn every night--

13:58.740 --> 14:01.160
14th between Franklin and Wythe.

14:01.430 --> 14:03.330
Then I'll hit him where he lives.

14:29.120 --> 14:30.190
Finch.

14:30.450 --> 14:31.950
I just found our guy.

14:31.950 --> 14:33.040
Is he talking?

14:33.310 --> 14:34.660
Not at the moment.

14:36.190 --> 14:41.430
Turski, Leon Josef, with an "F".

14:41.430 --> 14:42.450
Hold on.

14:44.590 --> 14:46.420
I know who has Sam, Finch.

14:46.710 --> 14:49.330
Szajka Pruszkow Dziewiec: SP-9.

14:49.550 --> 14:52.500
It's a nasty street gang from eastern Europe.

14:52.510 --> 14:54.570
You dealt with them in your former employment?

14:54.580 --> 14:56.690
They were trading with the Pashtun Warlords.

14:56.690 --> 14:58.010
Guns for heroin.

14:58.010 --> 15:00.430
But they also run kidnappings in Warsaw.

15:01.500 --> 15:04.200
Looks like they just opened up a new branch in New York.

15:06.220 --> 15:08.130
Come on, let's go for a ride.

15:09.680 --> 15:11.170
That's all I need, detective.

15:13.600 --> 15:14.710
Thank you.

15:16.690 --> 15:18.460
Carter, homicide, I got your message.

15:18.470 --> 15:19.620
Detective Olson.

15:19.620 --> 15:20.890
I got your bolo.

15:20.890 --> 15:24.440
White male, 6'2", graying temples, nice suit.

15:24.500 --> 15:27.120
Super said he saw him leaving at the time of the 911.

15:27.120 --> 15:28.500
Did you get audio on the call?

15:28.500 --> 15:30.230
What audio? Nobody said boo.

15:30.230 --> 15:32.480
M.E. Said she was dead two hours before.

15:32.480 --> 15:34.110
So you think your guy killed her?

15:34.110 --> 15:37.350
No, I think he called 911.

15:38.250 --> 15:40.650
Great, she's F.O.B. from Puerto Rico,

15:40.650 --> 15:42.280
No family, no boyfriend.

15:42.310 --> 15:44.660
Man, I thought you were going to gift wrap this for me.

15:45.940 --> 15:47.430
What kind of work does she do?

15:47.690 --> 15:50.930
Oh, she was a nanny on the west side.

15:50.930 --> 15:52.900
We've got unis talking to her clients.

15:53.020 --> 15:55.850
So if your guy wasn't the shooter, what was he doing here?

15:57.730 --> 15:59.490
Someone killed Christina?

16:00.020 --> 16:01.770
Oh, god, I--

16:02.150 --> 16:04.190
She wasn't here when Sam came home.

16:04.200 --> 16:05.280
Sam?

16:06.270 --> 16:07.270
My son.

16:07.660 --> 16:09.950
She wasn't here when he came home from school,

16:09.950 --> 16:11.640
So he called me.

16:11.640 --> 16:13.290
I came home to be with him.

16:13.920 --> 16:15.530
He's upstairs playing right now.

16:19.670 --> 16:21.280
Thanks for your time, judge.

16:38.760 --> 16:40.970
Christina was, um...

16:43.340 --> 16:44.820
She was, uh...

16:47.010 --> 16:49.340
With us the night that Elizabeth died.

16:52.400 --> 16:54.250
She was so good with Sam.

16:57.090 --> 16:58.710
She was just a kid.

17:01.330 --> 17:02.930
He's alive, okay?

17:04.190 --> 17:07.339
As long as they need him, Sam's still alive.

17:07.339 --> 17:08.579
You don't know that.

17:11.359 --> 17:12.849
I need your help, judge.

17:14.630 --> 17:17.740
Have you ever heard of the szajka pruszkow, sp-9?

17:19.780 --> 17:20.839
What are you?

17:21.869 --> 17:22.900
An ex-cop?

17:22.900 --> 17:23.930
FBI?

17:25.000 --> 17:28.380
I have experience in situations like this.

17:28.840 --> 17:30.450
That's all you need to know.

17:30.470 --> 17:31.470
Yeah?

17:32.220 --> 17:33.750
Well, maybe you're not enough.

17:35.200 --> 17:36.870
Maybe I should call those officers back

17:36.870 --> 17:38.050
And tell them the truth.

17:38.050 --> 17:39.500
I know how to be invisible.

17:39.510 --> 17:41.370
The police and the fBI don't.

17:41.370 --> 17:44.010
But I'm going after your son regardless.

17:45.170 --> 17:50.520
Now, have you ever heard of a gang called sp-9?

17:52.290 --> 17:53.400
No.

17:54.180 --> 17:55.210
Who are they?

17:58.690 --> 17:59.950
That's them now.

18:09.580 --> 18:10.620
Hello?

18:11.820 --> 18:12.800
You're alone?

18:13.120 --> 18:14.090
Yes.

18:14.480 --> 18:16.390
I need proof that my son is alive.

18:16.390 --> 18:17.790
Put Sam on the phone.

18:20.090 --> 18:21.090
Dad?

18:21.250 --> 18:23.710
Sam... are you hurt?

18:23.710 --> 18:25.690
Dad, please, I want to go home!

18:25.690 --> 18:26.880
Sam, Sam!

18:26.880 --> 18:29.180
Relax, your honor.

18:30.380 --> 18:31.550
Your son is just fine.

18:31.550 --> 18:32.920
He's a good boy.

18:34.150 --> 18:35.700
Smart, like you.

18:35.780 --> 18:36.810
How much?

18:37.750 --> 18:39.270
I'll pay anything you want.

18:39.980 --> 18:41.000
See?

18:41.410 --> 18:42.840
Smart.

18:43.520 --> 18:46.840
But, fortunately for you, we don't want your money.

18:47.450 --> 18:50.060
We want your help.

18:50.210 --> 18:52.820
There's a case in your court right now,

18:52.890 --> 18:55.860
The people vs. Angela Markham.

18:56.620 --> 19:00.550
The people... are going to lose.

19:01.120 --> 19:01.860
What?

19:01.860 --> 19:03.700
Throw the case, judge.

19:03.880 --> 19:06.180
Angela Markham walks.

19:07.660 --> 19:09.560
Or your son dies.

19:15.690 --> 19:16.990
Angela Markham?

19:17.130 --> 19:19.480
She mowed down some guy in a parking garage.

19:19.860 --> 19:21.470
It's a simple hit and run.

19:21.470 --> 19:24.180
Well, now she's become the key to finding your son.

19:41.280 --> 19:43.160
Angela Markham is an account exec

19:43.160 --> 19:45.360
At a tech company near the trade center.

19:45.860 --> 19:48.710
Six weeks ago, she got drunk at an office retirement party,

19:48.710 --> 19:50.740
And hit a CPA on her way out.

19:51.680 --> 19:55.320
Charged with DWI and vehicular manslaughter.

19:55.710 --> 19:57.290
It's just a random accident.

19:58.260 --> 19:59.500
What does this woman have to do

19:59.510 --> 20:00.880
With the people who took my son?

20:00.880 --> 20:01.940
I don't know.

20:01.940 --> 20:04.960
But it's not just Sam's life they're playing with.

20:05.150 --> 20:06.760
They're planning to kill you too.

20:08.580 --> 20:09.850
How can you know that?

20:10.560 --> 20:11.910
Where are you getting your information?

20:11.910 --> 20:14.590
Let's just say I have a source and it's never wrong.

20:14.930 --> 20:16.900
Look, these people can't be reasoned with.

20:16.900 --> 20:18.220
They can't be trusted.

20:18.500 --> 20:20.010
If we're going to save your son,

20:20.820 --> 20:22.460
I need to find a way to hurt them.

20:22.460 --> 20:24.100
The trial resumes in 30 minutes.

20:24.100 --> 20:24.980
What do I do?

20:24.980 --> 20:25.950
Just stall.

20:25.950 --> 20:29.150
Make it look like you're cooperating.

20:29.310 --> 20:30.610
But buy me time.

20:36.020 --> 20:37.270
Well, this isn't a street gang.

20:37.270 --> 20:39.510
This is a multinational corporation.

20:39.630 --> 20:43.900
SP-9 is active in at least 18 countries in Europe, Asia--

20:43.900 --> 20:46.250
After Interpol took down the old Pruszkow Mafia,

20:46.250 --> 20:47.350
They got smarter.

20:47.350 --> 20:48.890
Started hiding their tattoos,

20:48.890 --> 20:51.200
Studied military discipline, computers--

20:51.200 --> 20:53.240
They have almost no digital footprint.

20:53.240 --> 20:56.120
I have yet to find anything that could help us find Gates' son.

20:57.460 --> 20:58.780
Then focus on her.

20:58.960 --> 21:01.240
Somehow this girl and that gang connect.

21:01.240 --> 21:03.440
My best guess, whoever she's sleeping with

21:03.440 --> 21:05.070
Is high up in sp-9.

21:05.340 --> 21:07.860
Bet her boyfriend knows where they're keeping Sam.

21:10.550 --> 21:12.940
And while I'm checking into the girl, what'll you be doing?

21:12.940 --> 21:14.870
Tracking down the rest of them.

21:21.230 --> 21:24.360
The longest it's ever taken me to break someone is 16 hours.

21:26.460 --> 21:28.690
You don't look like you're going to set a record.

21:28.920 --> 21:29.970
Want to talk?

21:32.100 --> 21:33.510
You must like it in there.

21:35.880 --> 21:37.090
Caught a fresh one?

21:37.090 --> 21:39.720
My guy in a suit led me to another case.

21:39.720 --> 21:42.460
Nanny from the Bronx murdered on her lunch break.

21:44.740 --> 21:46.250
Shooter dug the slugs out, huh?

21:46.260 --> 21:47.420
Just the one,

21:47.420 --> 21:49.780
And I'm not so sure that was the shooter.

21:52.610 --> 21:54.170
It's my ex, I've got to take this.

21:56.290 --> 21:58.190
You've got a real creepy sense of timing, man.

21:58.190 --> 21:59.970
Ballistics report, detective.

21:59.970 --> 22:00.980
Squat.

22:01.070 --> 22:02.740
Your slug's not in the system.

22:02.860 --> 22:05.260
And I'm pretty sure that Carter's working your crime scene.

22:05.970 --> 22:06.970
Hey, does this dead nanny

22:06.970 --> 22:08.620
Have anything to do with the missing kid?

22:08.620 --> 22:10.650
I'll call when I need something else.

22:11.380 --> 22:13.210
You need all the help you can get right now.

22:13.860 --> 22:15.340
I mean, if I can I.D. The nanny killer,

22:15.340 --> 22:16.830
It might help you with the kid.

22:16.830 --> 22:17.890
Am I wrong?

22:18.150 --> 22:20.500
I'll give you a way to contact me.

22:20.780 --> 22:23.990
Keep me posted and keep Carter out of my way.

22:31.910 --> 22:33.840
So what have we got?

22:34.200 --> 22:36.840
Primary's thinking romance-gone-bad,

22:36.840 --> 22:38.750
But those are always so messy.

22:38.750 --> 22:40.230
This is too clean.

22:40.970 --> 22:42.820
Look at the circles on this entrance wound.

22:43.010 --> 22:44.380
How many pissed-off boyfriends you know

22:44.380 --> 22:45.990
Go out and buy a silencer?

22:46.420 --> 22:47.720
Romance, my ass.

22:47.720 --> 22:49.360
Your killer is a pro.

22:51.670 --> 22:52.650
Pull up a chair.

22:54.460 --> 22:55.860
All rise.

22:56.470 --> 22:58.640
The honorable Judge Gates presiding.

23:04.690 --> 23:05.760
Be seated.

23:12.620 --> 23:15.230
In the matter of the people vs. Angela Markham,

23:15.600 --> 23:17.110
Court is now in session.

23:31.030 --> 23:32.020
Hey, Leon.

23:32.020 --> 23:33.550
How's the ride back there?

23:37.810 --> 23:38.750
Now...

23:39.180 --> 23:41.020
You can have this juicy burger,

23:41.580 --> 23:43.400
Or you can go for another spin.

23:43.990 --> 23:47.180
All you have to do is help me find a scared little boy.

23:47.400 --> 23:49.530
I don't know where he is, I swear to god.

23:49.530 --> 23:52.320
Who's Angela Markham and what does she have to do with sp-9?

23:52.320 --> 23:53.750
Never heard of her.

23:54.200 --> 23:56.290
Look, I don't know why they wanted that kid.

23:56.300 --> 23:57.860
You don't know much, do you?

23:57.860 --> 23:58.970
That's how they run it.

23:58.970 --> 24:01.350
They work in small teams. Cells.

24:01.350 --> 24:03.570
So who's in your cell? Full names.

24:03.570 --> 24:05.510
We only use street names.

24:06.130 --> 24:09.850
A-K, Krakow, Sops, Ziom.

24:12.180 --> 24:13.630
Look, there's four guys, that's all I know.

24:13.630 --> 24:15.290
Now would you please let me out of here?

24:15.300 --> 24:16.920
For no names and no info?

24:16.920 --> 24:18.080
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.

24:18.080 --> 24:19.160
Okay, wait.

24:20.490 --> 24:21.810
I know a place.

24:22.970 --> 24:26.170
It's 3185 Lorimer.

24:26.930 --> 24:28.610
It's where I go to get paid.

24:30.300 --> 24:31.240
Good.

24:33.750 --> 24:35.360
How am I supposed to eat it?

24:35.720 --> 24:36.960
You'll figure it out.

24:36.960 --> 24:40.000
I observed a white suv driving erratically at high speed.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.440
I stopped the vehicle for a possible DWI.

24:42.680 --> 24:45.100
And what did you see when you approached the car?

24:46.100 --> 24:47.060
Blood.

24:47.310 --> 24:48.270
On the front left fender.

24:48.270 --> 24:50.600
Objection, facts not in evidence.

24:51.790 --> 24:52.890
Sustained.

24:57.820 --> 25:00.200
Uh, how did the vehicle look?

25:00.970 --> 25:02.660
There was front end damage.

25:02.660 --> 25:04.300
A red fluid that appeared to be blood--

25:04.300 --> 25:05.800
Objection, your Honor.

25:06.090 --> 25:07.140
Sustained.

25:09.060 --> 25:10.690
What happened then?

25:10.850 --> 25:12.290
The defendant got out of the vehicle.

25:12.290 --> 25:13.260
She appeared to be intoxicated.

25:13.260 --> 25:14.180
Objection!

25:14.180 --> 25:14.900
Sustained.

25:14.900 --> 25:16.670
- Your honor--  - Counselor...

25:17.890 --> 25:19.410
I'm going to give you some time

25:19.530 --> 25:21.410
To better prepare your witness.

25:24.180 --> 25:25.860
Resume at 10:00 A.M. Tomorrow.

25:51.100 --> 25:52.120
Judge Gates.

25:52.120 --> 25:54.070
I'm disappointed, your Honor.

25:54.620 --> 25:56.120
How did you know I was here?

25:57.050 --> 25:58.210
Did she tell you?

25:59.390 --> 26:01.620
Who is Angela Markham to you anyway?

26:02.510 --> 26:04.890
You don't want your son back, is that it?

26:05.810 --> 26:07.000
Let me talk to him.

26:07.370 --> 26:10.620
Not until you stop stalling.

26:11.110 --> 26:12.060
Look...

26:13.480 --> 26:17.680
I have to do this right or the D.A. Can appeal.

26:18.050 --> 26:19.450
You want her free,

26:20.510 --> 26:22.630
I have to make sure she stays that way.

26:22.630 --> 26:23.690
Do it right.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.340
And do it fast.

26:26.290 --> 26:28.440
And don't forget what you're playing for.

26:55.930 --> 26:57.640
We're running out of time, Mr. Reese.

26:57.640 --> 26:59.560
Did you dig up anything on Angela?

26:59.560 --> 27:02.060
Going through her contacts and emails even as we speak.

27:02.060 --> 27:03.530
Any progress with the gang?

27:03.530 --> 27:05.690
I got an address from Leon Turski.

27:05.690 --> 27:07.090
On my way now.

27:10.880 --> 27:12.510
It's as good as done.

27:12.590 --> 27:13.910
What, do you think I'm stupid?

27:13.910 --> 27:15.740
It's not done until I'm free and clear.

27:15.740 --> 27:17.540
This is bad for business.

27:18.060 --> 27:19.840
My clients are asking questions.

27:19.840 --> 27:21.010
That's not my problem.

27:21.010 --> 27:22.500
You are the problem.

27:22.500 --> 27:24.270
Our whole operation is in jeopardy

27:24.270 --> 27:25.740
Because you had too many shots.

27:25.740 --> 27:27.720
Unless you know someone who can do what I do,

27:27.720 --> 27:28.970
Our deal stands.

27:28.970 --> 27:31.590
Once you get the charges dropped, I go back to work.

27:31.590 --> 27:33.280
Business as usual.

28:15.890 --> 28:16.970
Where's the boy?

28:17.160 --> 28:18.600
I don't know!

28:28.530 --> 28:29.600
Finch...

28:31.140 --> 28:33.410
Just found a way to make these guys hurt.

28:38.610 --> 28:40.860
Well, find it and find out who took it.

28:40.860 --> 28:45.160
I am missing two men and $1/2 million.

28:45.990 --> 28:48.010
Someone is making a move against us.

28:48.010 --> 28:49.430
I need to know who!

28:50.620 --> 28:52.070
Contact your teams!

28:52.700 --> 28:54.060
Change of plans.

29:05.450 --> 29:07.720
I guess we know why they didn't ask for money.

29:07.870 --> 29:09.860
I have six more just like it.

29:09.860 --> 29:11.840
Could be our bargaining chip to get Sam.

29:11.840 --> 29:14.250
There may be lots more where these came from.

29:14.780 --> 29:16.930
Angela's not sleeping with our kidnapper.

29:17.280 --> 29:19.000
I think she's in business with him.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.890
That tech company she works for,

29:20.950 --> 29:22.520
They make banking software.

29:22.520 --> 29:25.060
The kind that can spot money laundering.

29:25.060 --> 29:27.530
And I just found a room full of small bills.

29:27.660 --> 29:30.820
In 2009, she oversaw the installation

29:30.820 --> 29:34.370
Of a new anti-money laundering system at Onestate Bank.

29:34.370 --> 29:35.770
If she still has access,

29:35.780 --> 29:39.120
She could turn that whole system off with the click of a mouse.

29:39.120 --> 29:41.860
Then sp-9 uses one of the biggest banks in the world

29:41.870 --> 29:43.050
To clean its dirty money.

29:43.050 --> 29:44.250
They leave no digital footprint

29:44.250 --> 29:45.950
Because this is how they pay for things.

29:46.020 --> 29:48.230
Cars, lawyers, safe houses.

29:48.230 --> 29:50.330
If we can access those accounts,

29:50.670 --> 29:52.620
We'll have more than a bargaining chip.

29:53.630 --> 29:55.830
We'll have a way to find Sam junior.

29:58.550 --> 29:59.570
They know I'm stalling.

29:59.570 --> 30:00.550
We're getting close.

30:00.550 --> 30:02.930
Just need to hold off a little longer.

30:02.930 --> 30:03.850
You had your chance.

30:03.850 --> 30:05.880
I'm not playing games with my son's life.

30:05.890 --> 30:08.520
They'll kill you both as soon as they get what they want.

30:09.300 --> 30:10.920
Now, I can save your son.

30:11.930 --> 30:13.670
You just have to trust me.

30:17.780 --> 30:18.770
Upon further review,

30:18.780 --> 30:20.770
I'm reversing my decision on admissibility.

30:20.780 --> 30:21.940
Your honor!

30:22.170 --> 30:24.510
It doesn't pass the balancing test, counselor.

30:24.510 --> 30:27.750
This video would unfairly bias the jury against miss Markham.

30:27.750 --> 30:29.920
Then I move for a mistrial.

30:29.920 --> 30:30.810
Denied.

30:30.810 --> 30:31.680
Judge Gates--

30:31.680 --> 30:32.820
Approach.

30:39.520 --> 30:41.060
Is there a problem, counselor?

30:41.060 --> 30:42.840
Respectfully, sir...

30:43.220 --> 30:44.860
What the hell is going on?

30:44.950 --> 30:47.010
One more word and you are in contempt.

30:47.010 --> 30:49.790
I'll have you charged with misconduct if I have to.

30:50.090 --> 30:52.090
Trust me, miss Ramirez.

30:52.100 --> 30:54.880
You have no idea how far I'll go.

30:58.560 --> 30:59.880
Nothing further.

31:00.550 --> 31:02.080
Prosecution rests.

31:28.710 --> 31:29.770
That's account data.

31:29.770 --> 31:30.850
It's confidential.

31:30.850 --> 31:32.420
Not anymore, we just got hacked.

31:32.430 --> 31:34.790
What? How did they get past the firewall?

31:34.790 --> 31:35.740
I'm working here.

31:35.740 --> 31:37.060
What's your name? Who are you?

31:37.070 --> 31:38.200
Considering they called me

31:38.200 --> 31:39.990
When your system was compromised,

31:39.990 --> 31:42.050
I'd say I'm the guy that just took your job.

31:46.500 --> 31:48.520
A hospital would be nice about now.

31:48.520 --> 31:49.450
Where's the boy?

31:49.450 --> 31:51.740
I already told you, I don't know.

31:51.740 --> 31:53.550
How about your boss's name? You know that yet?

31:53.560 --> 31:56.690
I've got a family. You going to kill them too?

31:57.180 --> 31:58.400
Because he will.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.850
You ever see two cats in a bag?

32:00.860 --> 32:01.820
What?

32:02.270 --> 32:03.310
You want out?

32:06.920 --> 32:08.450
Get your boss's name.

32:10.140 --> 32:11.080
Carter.

32:11.230 --> 32:12.790
Come here, I think I got something.

32:15.630 --> 32:17.020
I did another canvass

32:17.020 --> 32:18.660
and I found a bodega near the Nanny's house

32:18.660 --> 32:19.570
With eyes on the street,

32:19.570 --> 32:23.670
And it's on the NYPD surveillance feed.

32:23.790 --> 32:25.620
This is right around the time of the murder.

32:25.650 --> 32:26.570
Look at this.

32:26.630 --> 32:27.710
White guy, long hair,

32:27.720 --> 32:28.640
Pulling off gloves.

32:28.640 --> 32:29.810
He could be our killer.

32:29.810 --> 32:31.350
Or just a guy with cold hands.

32:31.360 --> 32:34.220
What makes you so sure mr. Longhair is our man?

32:35.770 --> 32:37.820
You get a description I don't know about?

32:38.910 --> 32:40.060
I got a hunch.

32:40.940 --> 32:43.370
I ran his plate to get a name,

32:43.480 --> 32:45.210
But I got a company instead.

32:46.610 --> 32:47.960
Coldfield Holdings.

32:47.960 --> 32:49.130
It's in Brooklyn.

32:49.790 --> 32:50.890
Worth a look.

32:54.950 --> 32:56.360
Finch, got a name for you.

32:56.360 --> 32:58.000
Jarek Koska.

32:58.070 --> 32:59.850
Word is he's the boss.

33:00.300 --> 33:01.660
Well, if he is, he's careful about it.

33:01.660 --> 33:03.030
No accounts in his name.

33:03.030 --> 33:04.760
The operation is massive.

33:05.270 --> 33:07.060
Every morning at 5:00 a.m.,

33:07.760 --> 33:10.840
Angela shuts down Onestate's software for three minutes.

33:11.510 --> 33:13.900
Millions of dollars flow in undetected.

33:14.470 --> 33:17.240
SP-9's not just laundering their own money.

33:17.310 --> 33:19.310
They have hundreds of clients.

33:19.780 --> 33:21.720
All criminal themselves, I'm sure.

33:22.020 --> 33:23.820
If Koska's using a shell corporation,

33:23.830 --> 33:25.580
It could take hours to find it.

33:31.910 --> 33:33.010
Finch?

33:33.800 --> 33:35.090
Try Coldfield.

33:41.160 --> 33:42.830
Definitely a large account.

33:44.690 --> 33:46.710
Looks like the money's being used to buy...

33:48.380 --> 33:50.930
Boats, planes, real estate...

33:51.960 --> 33:53.640
Most of it right here in new york.

33:53.640 --> 33:55.040
That's them, get a list.

33:55.040 --> 33:57.290
The place they're holding Sam will be on it.

33:58.520 --> 34:00.020
I'm sending you an address.

34:00.020 --> 34:02.350
A building less than ten blocks from Gates' house.

34:02.350 --> 34:05.230
Purchased just two days before Angela went on trial.

34:05.230 --> 34:08.719
If I can find Sam, the judge won't have to throw her case.

34:08.719 --> 34:10.409
Well, you better move fast.

34:10.989 --> 34:13.280
I think Angela's jury just reached a verdict.

34:15.520 --> 34:19.989
Finch, if you don't hear from me in four minutes, call 911.

34:20.110 --> 34:23.480
Send them here and tell them about sam.

34:28.300 --> 34:29.290
Please rise.

34:36.960 --> 34:38.400
Has the jury reached a verdict?

34:38.400 --> 34:39.800
We have, your honor.

34:52.270 --> 34:53.340
What say you?

34:57.180 --> 34:58.720
We find the defendant...

35:00.150 --> 35:02.530
not guilty on all charges.

35:15.900 --> 35:17.320
If you want your son back, come alone.

35:17.360 --> 35:19.990
No cell, no gps, no weapons.

35:20.210 --> 35:22.070
If I see anyone who's not you,

35:22.080 --> 35:23.610
Your son dies.

35:32.280 --> 35:33.820
So Angela Markham walks,

35:33.820 --> 35:36.080
And judge Gates is heading to a death sentence.

35:36.520 --> 35:37.630
The machine sent us his number

35:37.630 --> 35:39.460
Because they were planning to kill him all along.

35:39.460 --> 35:40.850
Him and his son.

35:40.850 --> 35:42.250
Scorched earth policy.

35:42.260 --> 35:43.570
Clean up and cover their tracks

35:43.570 --> 35:44.900
As soon as they get what they want.

35:44.900 --> 35:46.200
We need to warn him.

35:46.200 --> 35:48.150
I've tried. He won't listen.

35:48.360 --> 35:49.560
But we have to do something.

35:49.560 --> 35:50.530
We are.

35:51.700 --> 35:52.840
Hello, Angela. -

36:20.780 --> 36:22.370
I want to see my son!

36:34.010 --> 36:35.050
Dad!

36:35.680 --> 36:36.610
Sam!

36:37.140 --> 36:38.100
No!

36:38.210 --> 36:39.630
I'll let you say good-bye.

36:39.630 --> 36:42.140
Look, you've got me.

36:42.850 --> 36:44.480
I did what you asked.

36:45.020 --> 36:46.890
Everything you asked.

36:47.030 --> 36:47.800
You can keep me,

36:47.800 --> 36:51.210
But please let my son go.

36:51.210 --> 36:52.240
Sorry.

36:53.630 --> 36:54.900
Your honor.

36:55.360 --> 36:56.340
Stop!

36:58.880 --> 37:00.870
Your name is jarek Koska.

37:01.380 --> 37:06.930
Your bank account number is 1278340102.

37:06.970 --> 37:08.310
Last year you laundered

37:08.310 --> 37:10.490
At least $400 million to clients

37:10.490 --> 37:14.050
Including MS-13, the Sinaloa Cartel,

37:14.130 --> 37:15.740
And the government of north korea.

37:15.740 --> 37:18.890
So you got some info from that alcoholic bitch.

37:19.940 --> 37:21.980
I'm the last one you'll ever tell.

37:23.220 --> 37:25.050
These aren't good odds for you.

37:25.170 --> 37:26.470
I'm not alone.

37:32.050 --> 37:33.650
Every last dime has been transferred

37:33.660 --> 37:35.220
To an offshore account.

37:35.220 --> 37:38.550
Do exactly what I say and you might get it back.

37:38.590 --> 37:40.740
But if they don't walk out of here alive,

37:41.010 --> 37:43.720
Every client on your list will be notified

37:43.720 --> 37:45.630
That you've lost all their money.

37:46.310 --> 37:47.880
Then I won't have to kill you.

37:48.060 --> 37:49.990
Your clients will do that for me.

37:58.810 --> 38:00.480
The operation's burned.

38:02.380 --> 38:03.620
Shoot them all.

38:11.590 --> 38:12.540
Dad!

38:15.340 --> 38:17.000
Judge, is he all right?

38:17.000 --> 38:17.970
Yeah.

38:18.670 --> 38:19.950
Then take him home.

38:37.680 --> 38:39.730
It's time we go for a little ride.

39:09.510 --> 39:11.200
3185 Lorimer.

39:11.200 --> 39:12.740
It's owned by Coldfield.

39:13.120 --> 39:15.210
And there's mr. Longhair's car.

39:20.100 --> 39:22.000
NYPD, anybody home?

40:01.120 --> 40:02.250
Shoot, shoot!

40:03.490 --> 40:04.700
Goal!

40:09.850 --> 40:11.780
That's us, 10, trees, 0.

40:12.290 --> 40:13.690
You're so weird, dad.

40:14.390 --> 40:15.690
- Do it again? - Let's go!

40:15.690 --> 40:16.640
Here we go!

40:28.210 --> 40:29.920
I wasn't sure I'd ever see you again.

40:31.370 --> 40:34.010
Yeah, I'm, uh, not great

40:34.010 --> 40:35.840
At keeping in touch with people.

40:37.180 --> 40:38.580
I don't know how to thank you.

40:39.010 --> 40:40.840
You don't need to say anything.

40:43.060 --> 40:44.890
I'd prefer it actually.

40:46.340 --> 40:47.300
Look...

40:48.510 --> 40:50.400
I don't know exactly what you do,

40:51.010 --> 40:52.970
Or how you're doing it.

40:53.870 --> 40:56.230
But I know that if people ever find out...

40:58.090 --> 40:59.480
When they find out...

41:00.860 --> 41:03.060
There won't be anything I can do to protect you.

41:05.000 --> 41:06.180
Go play with your son.

41:25.880 --> 41:26.940
What did he say?

41:27.600 --> 41:29.150
That we don't need to worry.

41:30.450 --> 41:32.370
He might even help us someday.

41:32.470 --> 41:35.610
I was listening to your conversation, mr. Reese.

41:37.240 --> 41:39.270
And I was reading between the lines.

41:45.700 --> 41:48.400
I suppose only time will tell which one of us is right.

41:49.460 --> 41:50.460
Thank you.

41:52.760 --> 41:53.930
I beg your pardon?

41:55.740 --> 41:57.290
For giving me a job.

42:05.630 --> 42:07.540
Try the eggs benedict, mr. Reese.

42:08.620 --> 42:10.200
I've had them many times.
