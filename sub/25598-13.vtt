No.

18:29.984 --> 18:31.694
Let me just get this
straight.

18:31.694 --> 18:35.197
Rather than fight for me,
or even tell me the truth,

18:35.197 --> 18:36.574
you gave up on me.

18:36.574 --> 18:39.285
And then years later,
walk into my home,

18:39.285 --> 18:42.455
to have me save you from making
the same mistake again?

18:42.455 --> 18:44.832
You were the only person
I knew who could help.

18:44.832 --> 18:46.793
I could have, Judy,
but not anymore.

18:46.793 --> 18:48.002
Samantha, please.

18:48.002 --> 18:49.462
I used that word
with you.

18:49.462 --> 18:52.590
I said, "Please,
don't let them take me."

18:52.590 --> 18:55.093
But you could've stopped them,
and you didn't.

18:56.928 --> 18:58.930
So now I'm giving up on you.

Whatever it is,

19:09.857 --> 19:11.317
KATRINA:
This won't take long.

19:11.317 --> 19:13.235
I would just like
to start the process

19:13.235 --> 19:15.738
of having Brian removed
as my associate.

19:15.738 --> 19:18.157
What?
He's too advanced for me.

19:18.157 --> 19:19.993
All right.

19:19.993 --> 19:23.663
You wanna tell me what
happened between the two of you?

19:23.663 --> 19:25.289
Or should I figure it out
myself?

19:25.289 --> 19:27.750
Nothing happened.
Won't take long to figure out.

19:27.750 --> 19:31.129
I'm pretty sure you would rather
just tell me about it yourself.

19:31.129 --> 19:32.964
Okay, look.

19:32.964 --> 19:35.883
You told me
not to go into the kitchen.

19:35.883 --> 19:37.384
And I tried not to.

19:37.384 --> 19:41.263
But it turns out,
everywhere we go is the kitchen.

19:41.263 --> 19:43.182
So did something happen,
or not?

19:43.182 --> 19:45.935
No. But we both wanted it to.

19:45.935 --> 19:48.187
Then I told him
I can't work with him anymore.

19:48.187 --> 19:50.815
Then we fought, because
he said it would hurt him

19:50.815 --> 19:53.067
if I can't explain
why he's not my associate.

19:53.067 --> 19:55.069
And that's why
I told you that bullshit

19:55.069 --> 19:56.570
about him being too advanced.

19:56.570 --> 19:59.281
Bet it feels good
to get that off your chest.

19:59.281 --> 20:02.242
Only so much because
I still don't know what to do.

20:02.242 --> 20:03.327
Talk to him about it.

20:03.327 --> 20:05.079
I told you, I tried.
No.

20:05.079 --> 20:07.790
You told me you fought with him.
Fighting isn't talking.

20:07.790 --> 20:10.543
I know that better than anyone.
What do you mean?

20:10.543 --> 20:12.378
I mean I understand
what it's like

20:12.378 --> 20:15.214
to have complicated issues
with someone you work with,

20:15.214 --> 20:17.925
especially when they can't
have a real conversation.

20:17.925 --> 20:21.428
Are you talking about--?
You know who I'm talking about.

20:21.428 --> 20:23.723
Knowing that doesn't tell me
what I should do.

20:23.723 --> 20:24.765
I told you.

20:24.765 --> 20:27.101
Talk about it again.

20:27.101 --> 20:29.103
If you can't,
we'll have a real problem.

20:29.103 --> 20:30.646
Because Brian's right.

20:30.646 --> 20:32.356
You could really hurt
his career.

20:32.356 --> 20:34.316
Now I'm gonna go.

20:34.316 --> 20:37.319
Because sometimes the answer
is to fall for someone

20:37.319 --> 20:40.656
who has nothing to do
with this place at all.

20:49.749 --> 20:50.958
I was just on my way. Why?

20:50.958 --> 20:52.793
Because I can take it
from here.

20:52.793 --> 20:54.628
You can't be at two places
at once.

20:54.628 --> 20:56.797
Doesn't matter.
I dropped Judy's case.

20:56.797 --> 20:59.383
What? Samantha,
why would you do that?

20:59.383 --> 21:02.178
Same reason any attorney would.
My client lied to me.

21:02.178 --> 21:04.138
So thank you
for covering for me,

21:04.138 --> 21:05.472
but I've got it from here.

21:05.472 --> 21:06.807
You're not taking anything

21:06.807 --> 21:08.601
until you tell me
what's going on.

21:09.602 --> 21:11.562
I've got all night,
Samantha.

21:14.398 --> 21:15.900
[EXHALES]

21:15.900 --> 21:17.735
I always thought
it was the state

21:17.735 --> 21:19.695
that took me from her.

21:19.695 --> 21:21.321
Turns out it was Judy.

21:21.321 --> 21:22.949
She put me back
in the system,

21:22.949 --> 21:25.243
just when I thought
I had a real home.

21:25.243 --> 21:27.161
So tell me,
why should I stick by her

21:27.161 --> 21:29.329
when she didn't
stick by me?

21:29.329 --> 21:30.998
I don't know,
Samantha.

21:30.998 --> 21:33.834
But for her to admit all of that
must have killed her.

21:33.834 --> 21:35.795
Didn't do wonders
for me either, Robert.

21:35.795 --> 21:37.755
You saying
I should throw her a party?

21:37.755 --> 21:39.132
Sometimes being a parent

21:39.132 --> 21:41.383
is living with choices
that break your heart.

21:41.383 --> 21:43.469
It's not often
you get to make up for them.

21:43.469 --> 21:45.763
You have a chance
to help this woman do that.

21:45.763 --> 21:47.640
I think
maybe you should take it.

21:47.640 --> 21:50.434
Even if I was willing to,
I still can't get her a deal.

21:50.434 --> 21:53.146
Let's put our heads together
and figure something out.

21:53.146 --> 21:55.397
What about Louis' meeting?
He'll understand.

22:09.036 --> 22:11.998
You're negotiating
from a position of weakness.

22:11.998 --> 22:13.791

you try to stop me,

22:13.791 --> 22:16.585
and then Kevin Miller
offers me a job, out of nowhere,

22:16.585 --> 22:18.963

to go against you.

22:18.963 --> 22:20.047
It isn't.

22:20.047 --> 22:21.715
Yeah,
you keep saying that.

22:21.715 --> 22:23.259
But I did some digging.

your new business cards.

Brian and I developed feelings
for each other.

38:01.696 --> 38:04.950
We didn't mean to,
and we didn't act on it.

38:04.950 --> 38:06.993

38:06.993 --> 38:09.037

that deposition.

he's married, and I'm horrible.

No. Things like this happen.

as well as anyone.
