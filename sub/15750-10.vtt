00:41.709 --> 00:43.502
Sorry?

00:43.544 --> 00:45.963
I'm afraid we're
a rowdy bunch tonight.

00:46.005 --> 00:47.047
That's all right.

00:47.089 --> 00:48.924
Would you please excuse me?

00:48.966 --> 00:51.260
So many old friends to meet.

00:51.302 --> 00:52.678
I'm going to the pictures.

00:52.720 --> 00:54.388
Me too.

00:54.430 --> 00:55.639
Can I come?

00:55.681 --> 00:57.308
Pa, make them
take me with them.

00:57.349 --> 00:59.477
Gordon, take your sister.

00:59.518 --> 01:01.812
Go on, do it for me.

01:01.854 --> 01:03.147
Everyone,
it is Thanksgiving

01:03.189 --> 01:04.565
in a couple of days,

01:04.607 --> 01:06.150
and I want us
to sit down together

01:06.192 --> 01:07.902
for an entire evening
as a family.

01:07.943 --> 01:10.237
We're going to give thanks
for our many blessings,

01:10.279 --> 01:12.114
just as we've always done.

01:12.156 --> 01:13.741
All right?

01:16.202 --> 01:17.828
This place'll be heaving
with customers

01:17.870 --> 01:19.538
by the time you and Agnes
work your magic here.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.457
It's going to need
a spruce-up

01:21.499 --> 01:23.876
before the wedding,
that's for sure.

01:23.918 --> 01:25.920
Mr. and Mrs. Colleano, eh?

01:25.961 --> 01:29.173
Not long now.

01:45.189 --> 01:47.149
What have I done
to offend you?

01:47.191 --> 01:49.151
We can't be together
anymore, Florian.

01:49.193 --> 01:51.070
It's wrong.

01:51.111 --> 01:53.322
Who says it's wrong?

01:53.364 --> 01:57.535
I'm too old for you.

01:57.576 --> 01:59.954
There's no future in it.

01:59.995 --> 02:03.749
You decide this
without even discussing with me?

02:03.791 --> 02:05.543
I have your interests at heart,
please know that.

02:05.584 --> 02:09.420
What I do know is
we made each other happy.

02:11.090 --> 02:14.343
I know I love you.

02:14.385 --> 02:16.262
You don't decide that for me.

02:29.233 --> 02:30.693
Ready?

02:30.734 --> 02:32.486
Ready.

02:32.528 --> 02:35.531
It's going to feel
really odd, though.

02:35.573 --> 02:37.783
Do you think Mr. Selfridge
will understand us

02:37.825 --> 02:39.743
handing our notice in
so suddenly?

02:39.785 --> 02:42.162
He knows I'd want George
at my wedding.

02:42.204 --> 02:44.665
Army doctor says that
his arm is on the mend,

02:44.707 --> 02:46.917
so he'll be back
at the Front in no time.

02:46.959 --> 02:50.004
You'll have me to share
your worries with, Agnes.

02:52.256 --> 02:54.508
Actually, he's going to come
into the store today.

02:54.550 --> 02:56.760
He says he feels
ready to now.

03:05.436 --> 03:06.937
The American Embassy
advises me

03:06.979 --> 03:08.939
that all charges
have been dropped.

03:08.981 --> 03:10.190
I'm a free man.

03:10.232 --> 03:11.358
I'm so happy for you, Henri.

03:11.400 --> 03:12.359
Congratulations.

03:12.401 --> 03:13.819
Thank you.

03:13.861 --> 03:16.780
The Selfridge name
will be cleared too.

03:16.822 --> 03:18.365
You'll see.

03:18.407 --> 03:19.700
Sure, son.

03:19.742 --> 03:21.327
Now that I'm free to travel,

03:21.368 --> 03:23.245
I have to go
and sign up to fight.

03:23.287 --> 03:25.581
It's the right thing to do.

03:25.623 --> 03:28.667
I'll be sorry to see you go,
but of course I understand.

03:47.561 --> 03:48.979
Miss Plunkett,

03:49.021 --> 03:51.649
I was unaware
that Mr. Selfridge

03:51.690 --> 03:54.234
was due to meet
Frank Edwards tonight.

03:55.819 --> 03:57.071
Really?

03:59.323 --> 04:01.492
I need some of his evenings
for social engagements.

04:01.533 --> 04:04.161
I don't see any available
for the next month.

04:04.203 --> 04:06.330
If I get to the diary
faster than you,

04:06.372 --> 04:08.457
then that's your look out,
Miss Blenkinsop.

04:10.334 --> 04:11.835
Oh!

04:11.877 --> 04:13.629
Is everything all right,
Miss Mardle?

04:13.671 --> 04:14.505
Mind your own business!

04:18.341 --> 04:19.677
That was rude of me.

04:19.718 --> 04:22.012
I am terribly sorry,
Miss Calthorpe.

04:22.053 --> 04:23.263
Please excuse me.

04:23.305 --> 04:24.682
Of course.

04:24.723 --> 04:27.101
Everyone's entitled
to a bad day.

04:27.142 --> 04:28.727
Is that what I'm having?

04:28.769 --> 04:32.147
Well, you do seem
a bit out of sorts.

04:32.189 --> 04:33.732
Yes, I suppose
I am rather.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.864
My mom's not like
other people.

04:40.906 --> 04:42.866
She says a problem shared
is a problem doubled.

04:44.493 --> 04:46.328
But she also says,

04:46.370 --> 04:48.789
"When in doubt,
do something."

04:48.831 --> 04:50.332
Even if it's
the wrong thing,

04:50.374 --> 04:52.668
at least you'll be
making a decision.

04:53.961 --> 04:57.005
Yes, thank you,
Miss Calthorpe.

05:08.976 --> 05:11.395
Going anywhere nice, Rose?

05:11.437 --> 05:12.980
Just out and about.

05:13.021 --> 05:14.565
I'll come with you
if you like.

05:14.606 --> 05:15.649
I could do with some air.

05:15.691 --> 05:17.484
I have a lot of errands
to run today.

05:17.526 --> 05:19.319
Very boring.

05:19.361 --> 05:21.947
But I'd love to walk
with you later.

05:25.200 --> 05:27.995
Miss Towler and Mr. Colleano
to see you, sir.

05:28.036 --> 05:31.039
And Frank Edwards has confirmed
tonight's meeting.

05:36.879 --> 05:38.922
We want to get married,
Mr. Selfridge,

05:38.964 --> 05:40.799
while George is still here
to give me away.

05:42.468 --> 05:44.553
So we're both
handing in our notice.

05:47.347 --> 05:48.891
You're leaving?

05:48.932 --> 05:50.642
We'll inform Mr. Grove now.

05:50.684 --> 05:53.562
Miss Towler felt
you should know first.

05:53.604 --> 05:56.482
I know this
seems sudden,

05:56.523 --> 05:59.651
but war has a way
of quickening one's step.

06:04.323 --> 06:05.824
Thank you, Mr. Selfridge.

06:05.866 --> 06:07.242
For everything.

06:07.284 --> 06:09.995
You'll be sorely missed,
Mr. Colleano.

06:12.790 --> 06:15.167
Miss Towler, could I have
a minute, please?

06:17.127 --> 06:18.754
I know it's this
country's policy

06:18.796 --> 06:20.714
that married women
give up work,

06:20.756 --> 06:22.925
but I'm willing to bend
the rules for you.

06:22.966 --> 06:24.968
Thank you.

06:25.010 --> 06:27.805
But, um, I'm not just
joining a family;

06:27.846 --> 06:30.140
I'm joining
a family business.

06:30.182 --> 06:32.267
A family business.

06:32.309 --> 06:33.936
Has a nice ring to it.

06:33.977 --> 06:37.189
Not like Selfridge's,
obviously, but...

06:37.231 --> 06:39.191
I need to put
my whole heart into it

06:39.233 --> 06:40.818
for Mr. Colleano's sake.

06:40.859 --> 06:42.444
I can't pretend it's
not a sad day,

06:42.486 --> 06:44.988
what with Mr. Leclair
leaving and all.

06:46.448 --> 06:48.867
Where's he going?

06:48.909 --> 06:50.702
His name has been cleared.

06:50.744 --> 06:53.664
He's going to fight
for France.

07:01.171 --> 07:03.507
Can I help you,
Mr. Leclair?

07:03.549 --> 07:05.467
You can, if you'll
accept my apology.

07:05.509 --> 07:07.010
Apology?

07:07.052 --> 07:08.762
Miss Towler had to deal

07:08.804 --> 07:10.931
with her brother being missing
in her own way.

07:10.973 --> 07:12.891
I spoke out of turn

07:12.933 --> 07:15.602
and overstepped the mark
as a concerned colleague.

07:15.644 --> 07:17.229
I'm sorry.

07:18.814 --> 07:20.065
I accept your apology.

07:22.651 --> 07:24.278
I wanted to clear
the air between us

07:24.319 --> 07:25.571
before I join
the French Army.

07:26.989 --> 07:28.323
You're leaving?

07:28.365 --> 07:29.741
Yes.

07:29.783 --> 07:31.451
In a couple of days.

07:31.493 --> 07:33.912
Before I go, I wanted
to wish you and Miss Towler

07:33.954 --> 07:36.415
every happiness and success
in your life together.

07:38.584 --> 07:41.128
Thank you, Mr. Leclair.

07:41.169 --> 07:43.714
I hope you return
safe and well.

07:43.755 --> 07:45.924
I won't be coming back
to Selfridge's.

08:05.402 --> 08:07.654
Thank you for waiting,

08:07.696 --> 08:09.907
Mrs. Selfridge.

08:09.948 --> 08:11.700
Is that my X-ray plate?

08:11.742 --> 08:13.869
It is, yes.

08:15.746 --> 08:19.124
I've consulted
with a colleague...

08:21.209 --> 08:24.713
and, sadly, he confirms
my diagnosis.

08:27.090 --> 08:28.967
What do you mean?

08:30.928 --> 08:35.599
I'm afraid there's no way
to sweeten the pill.

08:37.851 --> 08:41.855
It's not good news,
Mrs. Selfridge.

08:59.665 --> 09:01.458
George Towler!

09:03.251 --> 09:04.544
Hello, Kitty.

09:06.421 --> 09:08.340
What did you do
to your arm?

09:11.218 --> 09:13.762
A pleasure,
Private Towler.

09:13.804 --> 09:15.055
Indeed, an honor.

09:15.097 --> 09:16.264
Thank you, Sir.

09:16.306 --> 09:18.684
We're extremely
proud of you, young man.

09:18.725 --> 09:20.060
Thank you, Mr. Grove.

09:20.102 --> 09:23.271
We were so worried
when you went missing.

09:23.313 --> 09:25.524
Like a bad penny,
Master Selfridge.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.401
I'll always show up.

09:28.694 --> 09:31.446
What was it like
out there?

09:36.410 --> 09:38.996
My father would love
to see you.

09:45.127 --> 09:46.628
I can't believe
he's back!

09:46.670 --> 09:48.171
All right now, ladies,
back to work.

09:55.429 --> 09:56.972
I heard we've lost men,

09:57.014 --> 09:58.724
Mr. Selfridge.

09:58.765 --> 10:00.308
Throughout the store.

10:00.350 --> 10:02.477
I've written letters
to all their families,

10:02.519 --> 10:04.312
so I'm very happy to see you

10:04.354 --> 10:07.190
and to know that's not a letter
I have to write.

10:09.276 --> 10:11.528
It's hell out there.

10:11.570 --> 10:15.323
Only they don't tell you that
in the newspapers.

10:15.365 --> 10:17.284
What kept you going?

10:17.325 --> 10:19.911
The small things kept you going,
Mr. Selfridge.

10:19.953 --> 10:21.955
Letters, parcels from home.

10:21.997 --> 10:23.749
Chocolate.

10:23.790 --> 10:25.500
Clean, dry socks.

10:25.542 --> 10:26.668
Baccy.

10:26.710 --> 10:27.836
Cocoa.

10:27.878 --> 10:29.421
The comforts of home.

10:29.463 --> 10:31.214
Exactly that.

10:31.256 --> 10:33.300
I'd open up
your parcel, Aggie,

10:33.341 --> 10:35.635
Straight into
the jars of jam.

10:35.677 --> 10:38.013
You and your
sweet tooth, George.

10:38.055 --> 10:40.932
The tasting bit
came after.

10:40.974 --> 10:43.977
First, I'd get the jar

10:44.019 --> 10:47.939
and put it up to my nose
and breathe in.

10:47.981 --> 10:50.067
Do you remember how
we used to make jam

10:50.108 --> 10:52.360
and chutney with Mother?

10:52.402 --> 10:54.780
Our life of crime,
Mr. Selfridge.

10:54.821 --> 10:57.491
Robbing orchards.

10:57.532 --> 10:59.576
I hope you didn't get caught,
like I did.

11:04.498 --> 11:08.085
Bedlam going on
all around you.

11:08.126 --> 11:10.670
Open a simple jar of jam,

11:10.712 --> 11:12.380
close your eyes

11:12.422 --> 11:15.217
and you're back
in your mother's kitchen again.

11:15.258 --> 11:18.178
A boy, all safe and warm.

11:22.224 --> 11:24.309
I want to reflect your brother's
words throughout the store.

11:24.351 --> 11:25.852
The comforts of home.

11:25.894 --> 11:27.395
The simple things.

11:27.437 --> 11:30.273
I'll get started
on a window straight away.

11:30.315 --> 11:32.859
Your swan song.

11:32.901 --> 11:34.236
Yes.

11:36.154 --> 11:41.118
These have been the best five
years of my life, Mr. Selfridge.

11:41.159 --> 11:44.287
Just you make sure the rest of
your life is equally as happy.

11:47.332 --> 11:49.042
Miss Towler,

11:49.084 --> 11:51.628
you've come to mean
a great deal to me.

11:51.670 --> 11:53.630
I want you to know that.

11:53.672 --> 11:56.299
Thank you, Mr. Selfridge.

11:56.341 --> 11:58.301
I'll miss you.

12:21.658 --> 12:24.035
Are you all right,
Mrs. Selfridge?

12:25.745 --> 12:28.123
I'm fine,
thank you, Fraser.

12:30.458 --> 12:34.921
I need to discuss the
Thanksgiving dinner with you.

12:34.963 --> 12:36.631
I want you to think
of something reassuring,

12:36.673 --> 12:37.924
Mr. Thackeray.

12:37.966 --> 12:39.718
Plain, old-fashioned
breakfast tea.

12:39.759 --> 12:41.469
A warm waterproof coat.

12:41.511 --> 12:43.096
Talcum powder.

12:43.138 --> 12:44.306
<i>SELFRIDGE:
Let some of the tea loose</i>

12:44.347 --> 12:46.057
so you get the aroma
as you approach.

12:46.099 --> 12:48.059
I'll put out the Mackintoshes
immediately, Mr. Selfridge.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.019
Miss Mardle?

12:49.060 --> 12:51.479
Most women would make
personal sacrifices

12:51.521 --> 12:52.564
for a decent
pair of gloves.

12:52.606 --> 12:53.857
To give a pleasant scent

12:53.899 --> 12:56.026
and to ease fingers
into gloves

12:56.067 --> 12:57.527
or stockings into shoes.

12:57.569 --> 12:59.237
I can do a bigger promotion
if you'd like?

12:59.279 --> 13:01.448
One glove turned inside out
on each set.

13:01.489 --> 13:02.949
Keep it simple.

13:02.991 --> 13:04.242
We are stoking memories,
that's all.

13:05.827 --> 13:07.537
Tell Cook that the girls

13:07.579 --> 13:09.372
brought pecans back
with them from Chicago,

13:09.414 --> 13:12.626
so she just has to get the rest
of the ingredients for the pies.

13:12.667 --> 13:16.838
Actually, Fraser, just tell her
I'll make them myself.

13:16.880 --> 13:19.382
Certainly,
Mrs. Selfridge.

13:19.424 --> 13:20.884
You make your own pies?

13:20.926 --> 13:22.344
Yes, pecan pies.

13:22.385 --> 13:23.386
Huh.

13:23.428 --> 13:24.930
The best in America,
actually.

13:24.971 --> 13:26.514
Sorry... Fraser?

13:26.556 --> 13:28.308
I need to add pumpkins
to that list.

13:28.350 --> 13:30.018
We can't get
sweet potatoes here.

13:30.060 --> 13:33.480
Oh, and the ingredients
for the corn bread...

13:33.521 --> 13:34.981
This is going to be

13:35.023 --> 13:38.151
the best Thanksgiving
dinner ever.

13:39.611 --> 13:41.196
Even

13:43.990 --> 13:45.575
We'll put white cloths

13:45.617 --> 13:47.619
on all the tables
for the wedding.

13:47.661 --> 13:50.121
That way we can use them
again for the public.

13:50.163 --> 13:52.916
And simple winter pansies
in the center.

13:52.958 --> 13:57.629
We could hang ivory silk bows
all along that wall.

13:57.671 --> 13:59.839
I'll do a suckling pig
on a spit outside, George.

14:02.259 --> 14:03.343
Right.

14:03.385 --> 14:04.427
Two types of ale.

14:04.469 --> 14:05.845
Pale and bitter.

14:05.887 --> 14:08.098
Oh! Sprinklings
of pine needles on the floor

14:08.139 --> 14:11.226
to give that lovely
winter smell.

14:11.268 --> 14:12.852
A bit of tender loving care
and we'll be ready

14:12.894 --> 14:14.479
to face the public,
won't we, Victor?

14:14.521 --> 14:15.814
Sorry?

14:15.855 --> 14:19.192
I was just saying
what we could do here.

14:19.234 --> 14:21.111
Come on, Franco,

14:21.152 --> 14:23.321
let's have a look upstairs
at what can be done.

14:23.363 --> 14:24.864
What's upstairs
got to do with me?

14:24.906 --> 14:25.907
You'll be the one painting it.

14:25.949 --> 14:26.783
Oh!

14:26.825 --> 14:28.076
Go on, get a move on.

14:28.118 --> 14:29.202
I've got to get back
to the store.

14:35.834 --> 14:37.877
All right, George?

14:37.919 --> 14:39.170
Penny for 'em?

14:40.588 --> 14:42.549
There's just a lot on my mind.

14:42.590 --> 14:46.678
Thinking about going back
to the Front?

14:48.263 --> 14:49.764
Just a lot of things.

14:59.316 --> 15:01.109
I had a quiet word with some
of the Procurement Committee,

15:01.151 --> 15:02.527
and they back Loxley
to the hilt.

15:02.569 --> 15:04.321
Even Edgerton.

15:04.362 --> 15:06.656
Well, there's a surprise.

15:06.698 --> 15:08.908
What we need is
incontrovertible proof

15:08.950 --> 15:10.577
that you did not recommend

15:10.618 --> 15:12.370
the manufacturers
Loxley says you did.

15:12.412 --> 15:13.872
But what kind of proof?

15:13.913 --> 15:15.957
Was anyone else party
to the conversations you had?

15:15.999 --> 15:17.584
No, I gave him a list.

15:17.625 --> 15:19.377
"Use these suppliers.

15:19.419 --> 15:21.379
On no account use those."

15:21.421 --> 15:22.881
Was that list
in your own handwriting?

15:22.922 --> 15:24.132
Yes.

15:24.174 --> 15:25.884
Normally I make copies,

15:25.925 --> 15:27.218
but because you vouched for him,
I didn't see the need.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.804
That list will be
long gone by now.

15:29.846 --> 15:32.766
Oh, no, I think
you underestimate

15:32.807 --> 15:34.434
my husband's arrogance, Harry.

15:34.476 --> 15:36.978
You think its possible
that he still has it?

15:37.020 --> 15:38.021
Well, if he does,

15:38.063 --> 15:40.482
I'll find it.

15:40.523 --> 15:42.108
Well, be careful, Mae.

15:42.150 --> 15:44.069
I don't want you
putting yourself in danger

15:44.110 --> 15:45.111
on my account.

15:45.153 --> 15:46.905
No, don't worry.

15:46.946 --> 15:49.240
I'll get Pimble to find out
when he's not at home,

15:49.282 --> 15:51.117
and then I'll go.

16:00.377 --> 16:02.420
I've arranged
an audition for you

16:02.462 --> 16:04.422
with the Halle Orchestra
in Manchester.

16:04.464 --> 16:06.674
They have an excellent
reputation.

16:06.716 --> 16:08.843
I'll pay for your
accommodations, of course.

16:08.885 --> 16:11.638
I am not joining an orchestra
when there's a war going on.

16:11.679 --> 16:13.890
There are more useful things
for me to do right now.

16:13.932 --> 16:15.642
I thought
you'd be pleased.

16:15.683 --> 16:16.601
I'm not pleased.

16:16.643 --> 16:17.394
Florian...

16:17.435 --> 16:18.686
This is your house,

16:18.728 --> 16:22.065
and maybe you think
I have no right to ask,

16:22.107 --> 16:23.566
but while
lam still here,

16:23.608 --> 16:26.111
please leave this room.

16:43.503 --> 16:44.712
Henri.

16:44.754 --> 16:46.047
I did not expect you back.

16:48.299 --> 16:50.218
I, um...

16:50.260 --> 16:52.762
I asked for homely things

16:52.804 --> 16:54.848
for my window.

16:54.889 --> 16:56.975
What's the idea?

16:57.016 --> 16:58.643
Home.

16:58.685 --> 17:00.270
The things that ground us.

17:00.311 --> 17:01.938
A family making jam.

17:01.980 --> 17:03.606
The results
in the jars.

17:03.648 --> 17:05.983
Deep, glossy colors
like melted jewels.

17:07.819 --> 17:09.279
What's funny?

17:09.319 --> 17:10.821
You.

17:10.864 --> 17:13.116
Seeing jewels in jam.

17:13.157 --> 17:16.161
Ordinary people
think of the taste.

17:16.202 --> 17:17.036
I am ordinary.

17:24.711 --> 17:27.088
So it appears
we're both leaving.

17:29.340 --> 17:33.761
Funny to think of other people
taking over our studio.

17:33.803 --> 17:37.765
All the hours that
we spent in here,

17:37.807 --> 17:42.020
going half crazy
looking for ideas.

17:44.105 --> 17:45.315
Yeah.

17:45.356 --> 17:46.733
Good times.

17:53.948 --> 17:55.241
One last walk

17:55.283 --> 17:57.994
in a London park at night.

17:58.036 --> 18:00.121
Like we used to.

18:00.163 --> 18:03.500
When we were together,
remember?

18:03.541 --> 18:06.586
I remember.

18:11.466 --> 18:13.927
How do we do this?

18:13.968 --> 18:18.181
Just walk for hours,
not saying anything much.

18:18.223 --> 18:19.891
Just being.

18:19.933 --> 18:22.227
This was our place.

18:27.690 --> 18:29.400
When I was a girl,

18:29.442 --> 18:33.238
I used to wake up
in the middle of the night.

18:33.279 --> 18:35.198
My mother was dying

18:35.240 --> 18:38.201
and my father was
drinking hard by then.

18:38.243 --> 18:42.539
But for those few hours,
it was quiet.

18:42.580 --> 18:49.462
Just me and this great
big city, asleep.

18:49.504 --> 18:52.382
I bet you sat up,
hugged your knees

18:52.423 --> 18:55.301
and dreamed about
what life would bring you.

18:55.343 --> 18:56.636
Did you do that?

18:56.678 --> 18:57.887
Yes, I did!

19:01.474 --> 19:03.059
But it was all
make-believe

19:03.101 --> 19:06.062
until Mr. Selfridge
came along.

19:06.104 --> 19:08.356
He must have dreamed
when he was a messenger boy.

19:10.984 --> 19:13.319
He'll miss you.

19:13.361 --> 19:15.488
He thinks the world of you.

19:17.865 --> 19:19.158
He'll miss you.

19:22.745 --> 19:24.706
Will you miss me?

19:26.416 --> 19:29.002
Of course I will.

19:29.043 --> 19:30.753
And you spare me a thought

19:30.795 --> 19:32.755
when you're up to your neck
in the restaurant, huh?

19:34.924 --> 19:37.302
Maybe little Agneses and Victors
pulling at your apron strings?

19:39.470 --> 19:41.556
It's hard to imagine that
right now.

19:49.981 --> 19:52.442
I have one big wish
for you, Agnes.

19:54.110 --> 19:56.946
That all your dreams come true.

20:02.118 --> 20:03.411
All over London,

20:03.453 --> 20:05.997
people will be waking up
in a few hours.

20:07.957 --> 20:09.667
I'll never forget you, Agnes.

20:13.004 --> 20:14.964
I'll never forget you, Henri.

20:58.675 --> 21:01.427
Hello, George.

21:01.469 --> 21:03.721
Just checking Agnes
isn't working too late.

21:03.763 --> 21:05.139
Or has she gone to bed?

21:05.181 --> 21:07.141
She's not back yet, Victor.

21:08.559 --> 21:09.894
Come in.

21:09.936 --> 21:12.021
Have a cup of tea.

21:14.774 --> 21:16.526
Miss Mardle and Mr. Dupont
turned in for the night,

21:16.567 --> 21:17.610
have they?

21:17.652 --> 21:18.861
That's right.

21:18.903 --> 21:20.905
I don't sleep so well.

21:20.947 --> 21:24.117
Easier to stay up in a chair
till I drop off.

21:24.158 --> 21:26.202
Very late for Agnes
to still be working.

21:26.244 --> 21:28.079
I'm a bit worried
about her.

21:28.121 --> 21:29.914
What is it, Victor?

21:33.584 --> 21:37.130
You're very close,
the pair of you.

21:37.171 --> 21:39.048
Is she going to be happy
at the restaurant, George?

21:41.175 --> 21:42.844
If she said
that's what she wants,

21:42.885 --> 21:44.554
then I'm sure
she'll be happy.

21:44.595 --> 21:46.597
Don't sound too sure.

21:46.639 --> 21:48.558
Well, I'm not the one
marrying you.

21:48.599 --> 21:50.059
Why are you asking me?

21:50.101 --> 21:51.352
Come on, George.

21:51.394 --> 21:53.146
I could see you was wondering

21:53.187 --> 21:55.022
whether the restaurant would be
the right future for her.

21:55.064 --> 21:57.275
Whether her talents would be
wasted there.

21:59.068 --> 22:00.987
We both know she's special.

22:01.028 --> 22:04.407
She'll always be
ordinary Agnes to me.

22:04.449 --> 22:06.159
She's not ordinary.

22:06.200 --> 22:07.952
Nothing wrong with that.

22:07.994 --> 22:09.412
Most of us are.

22:09.454 --> 22:11.914
But not Agnes.

22:11.956 --> 22:14.125
I'm sure she loves you,
Victor.

22:14.167 --> 22:15.501
Course she does.

22:15.543 --> 22:16.878
Why wouldn't she?

22:18.546 --> 22:23.134
All I know is she's
always been there for me.

22:23.176 --> 22:25.386
Loyal to her backbone.

22:25.428 --> 22:27.597
She'll never
let you down, Victor.

22:38.649 --> 22:40.735
Florian, what are you
doing here?

22:40.777 --> 22:42.862
A letter arrived.

22:42.904 --> 22:44.906
From the Halle Orchestra.

22:46.574 --> 22:48.534
Well, won't you at least
consider it?

22:48.576 --> 22:50.536
Once they hear you play,

22:50.578 --> 22:52.497
they'll accept you
without another thought.

22:52.538 --> 22:53.998
You are so anxious
to get rid of me?

22:54.040 --> 22:56.417
I only want what's best for you.

22:56.459 --> 22:57.877
Surely you must see that?

22:57.919 --> 22:59.670
Everything all right,
Miss Mardle?

22:59.712 --> 23:02.089
Perfectly all right,
Mr. Grove.

23:02.131 --> 23:04.425
I'm just resolving
some household issues

23:04.467 --> 23:05.593
with Mr. Dupont.

23:08.805 --> 23:10.681
A household issue.

23:10.723 --> 23:13.226
That is what I am to you, Josie?

23:13.267 --> 23:14.352
No.

23:16.145 --> 23:20.024
No, that's not how it is at all,
Florian.

23:20.066 --> 23:22.068
Now you make us
both lonely again.

23:22.109 --> 23:24.070
Is that what's best for us?

23:35.164 --> 23:37.542
Will you come and see me
when you have a moment?

23:39.585 --> 23:41.963
Have I done
something wrong?

23:42.755 --> 23:45.049
No.

23:45.091 --> 23:47.009
I fear I have.

23:56.644 --> 23:57.770
Come.

24:06.946 --> 24:09.323
May we speak
as true friends?

24:11.325 --> 24:13.786
In spite of all that's
passed between us,

24:13.828 --> 24:15.746
I'd like to think
we understand one another

24:15.788 --> 24:17.999
better than most.

24:18.040 --> 24:20.251
A true friend
wouldn't have spoken to me

24:20.293 --> 24:21.419
the way you did.

24:24.005 --> 24:26.424
What a thing to say to a woman.

24:26.465 --> 24:28.885
"Old fool."

24:28.926 --> 24:31.971
I beg your forgiveness.

24:34.849 --> 24:37.184
If anyone should wish you
happiness, it should be me.

24:37.226 --> 24:39.520
And I do, sincerely.

24:41.856 --> 24:43.983
However, you have given me
food for thought.

24:46.152 --> 24:48.195
Florian is a young man.

24:48.237 --> 24:51.574
A promising music career
ahead of him.

24:51.616 --> 24:53.868
<i>He has no business with me.</i>

24:53.910 --> 24:56.829
He loves you, Josie.

24:56.871 --> 24:59.582
I can see that from the way
he looks at you.

24:59.624 --> 25:01.918
It's no passing fancy.

25:03.878 --> 25:08.883
But if I care for him,
really care for him,

25:08.925 --> 25:10.927
then I must let him go.

25:13.846 --> 25:15.765
He may want children.

25:18.684 --> 25:20.561
He thinks he loves me now.

25:20.603 --> 25:23.022
But what about
in five years' time,

25:23.064 --> 25:24.440
ten years' time?

25:24.482 --> 25:26.233
What about if one day, he...

25:26.275 --> 25:27.568
Life is full of "what ifs."

25:27.610 --> 25:29.779
This country
is full of parents

25:29.820 --> 25:32.406
bidding their sons
goodbye,

25:32.448 --> 25:35.868
wondering "what if"-- "What if
I never see my son again?"

25:37.411 --> 25:39.789
You've got the man
you deserve.

25:41.499 --> 25:43.626
Don't throw him away.

26:25.918 --> 26:27.044
Miss Blenkinsop!

26:35.011 --> 26:36.804
Where's Mr. Selfridge's diary?

26:36.846 --> 26:38.848
I've no idea, Miss Plunkett.

26:38.889 --> 26:40.266
You took it, didn't you?

26:40.307 --> 26:42.560
Why would you do
such a childish

26:42.601 --> 26:43.477
and ridiculous thing?

26:43.519 --> 26:45.438
We both have a job to do,

26:45.479 --> 26:47.106
and you're making
mine impossible!

26:47.148 --> 26:48.691
I'm making it
impossible?!

26:48.733 --> 26:49.942
Ladies, please!

26:49.984 --> 26:52.069
This is most unseemly.

26:52.111 --> 26:54.780
What do you accuse
Miss Blenkinsop of taking,

26:54.822 --> 26:56.240
Miss Plunkett?

26:56.282 --> 26:58.117
My diary
for Mr. Selfridge.

27:06.500 --> 27:10.046
I only wanted to see
what dates I might have.

27:11.380 --> 27:13.841
This is not the wild
African savannah.

27:13.883 --> 27:15.468
Mr. Selfridge is
not a wildebeest

27:15.509 --> 27:18.804
to be hunted down
by slavering hyenas.

27:18.846 --> 27:21.265
Cooperate
and work peacefully

27:21.307 --> 27:22.641
and in tandem
from now on.

27:22.683 --> 27:23.434
What's going on?

27:23.476 --> 27:25.436
Nothing for you to
worry about, Mr. Selfridge.

27:25.478 --> 27:28.147
I think it might be better
for you to work

27:28.189 --> 27:29.648
from the Selfridge household,
Miss Blenkinsop,

27:29.690 --> 27:31.567
seeing as though you have

27:31.609 --> 27:34.153
all the family's social
engagements to arrange.

27:34.195 --> 27:35.654
Yes.

27:35.696 --> 27:38.032
We could meet here every Monday,
Miss Blenkinsop,

27:38.074 --> 27:40.910
to apportion Mr. Selfridge's
time to our diaries.

27:40.951 --> 27:43.788
Excellent idea,
Miss Plunkett.

28:02.098 --> 28:05.101
What do you think
you're doing?

28:05.142 --> 28:06.852
Of course.

28:06.894 --> 28:10.981
Dirty little scrubber
looking for money.

28:15.778 --> 28:19.031
Have I told you recently

28:19.073 --> 28:22.284
how utterly contemptible
you are?

28:22.326 --> 28:25.121
But my money is above contempt,
I take it?

28:25.162 --> 28:26.956
No, I don't think I have,

28:26.997 --> 28:30.709
so I really should avail myself
of this opportunity.

28:30.751 --> 28:34.088
You, Loxley.

28:34.130 --> 28:42.179
You are a weak,
wretched little man.

28:42.221 --> 28:46.058
On your knees... if you want it.

28:48.185 --> 28:51.355
You were born into nobility,

28:51.397 --> 28:53.691
but there's nothing noble
about you.

28:53.732 --> 28:55.901
You're a war profiteer.

28:55.943 --> 28:57.153
The scum of the earth.

28:57.194 --> 28:58.404
Get out.

28:58.445 --> 29:00.239
And you're a coward.

29:00.281 --> 29:02.283
Letting Harry Selfridge
take the blame

29:02.324 --> 29:05.661
for your dirty
money making schemes.

29:05.703 --> 29:08.539
Take the money and get out.

29:08.581 --> 29:11.125
It's the last
you'll get from me.

29:11.167 --> 29:14.336
I would keep an eye on
the newspapers if I were you.

29:14.378 --> 29:16.505
What's that supposed to mean?

29:20.134 --> 29:21.302
Good-bye, Loxley.

29:23.888 --> 29:25.681
May you rot in hell.

29:30.728 --> 29:33.439
I was wrong not to speak out
when I knew that Loxley

29:33.480 --> 29:35.691
was obtaining money
by foul means.

29:35.733 --> 29:40.196
And I was wrong to vouch for
a man I knew had no moral spine.

29:40.237 --> 29:43.032
Our troops have suffered
because of it.

29:43.073 --> 29:48.662
And you have endured
the blame, Harry.

29:48.704 --> 29:52.708
The Procurement Committee
convenes today.

29:52.750 --> 29:55.211
Go and right these wrongs.

29:55.252 --> 29:57.421
Go and clear your name.

30:37.920 --> 30:39.380
You can't go in there!

30:39.421 --> 30:40.547
Watch me.

30:52.601 --> 30:54.103
My name is Harry Selfridge,

30:54.144 --> 30:56.438
and I stand before you
to clear my name.

30:56.480 --> 30:57.815
Get out, Selfridge!

30:57.856 --> 30:58.899
This is the House of Lords.

30:58.941 --> 31:01.151
No place for a shopkeeper!

31:02.653 --> 31:06.615
This man is a traitor
to this country.

31:06.657 --> 31:08.158
Mr. Selfridge, please.

31:08.200 --> 31:09.910
And you are no better for not
speaking out against him.

31:09.952 --> 31:12.371
Somebody remove this man.

31:12.413 --> 31:13.914
You came to me for advice
on manufacturers

31:13.956 --> 31:15.207
to supply the troops.

31:15.249 --> 31:16.792
And look where
your advice led us.

31:16.834 --> 31:18.836
For the sake of the
troops, I say to you all,

31:18.877 --> 31:21.714
check every order that passed
through this man's hands.

31:21.755 --> 31:23.215
I am sure that
shoddy boots

31:23.257 --> 31:26.677
are merely the tip
of the iceberg.

31:26.719 --> 31:27.928
He has been feathering

31:27.970 --> 31:30.014
his own nest with kickbacks

31:30.055 --> 31:32.474
from crooked
and inferior manufacturers.

31:32.516 --> 31:34.268
A contemptible lie!

31:34.310 --> 31:37.187
Have you no shame,
Selfridge?

31:37.229 --> 31:38.814
Oh, I've been shamed.

31:38.856 --> 31:42.693
In the press, in the eyes
of the public, my staff,

31:42.735 --> 31:46.739
but most terrible of all,
in front of my family.

31:46.780 --> 31:48.073
And quite rightly so.

31:50.034 --> 31:51.910
I chose suppliers
on your word.

31:51.952 --> 31:55.247
The word of a gentleman,
I thought.

31:55.289 --> 31:58.250
The word of a man who knew
what he was about.

31:58.292 --> 32:00.085
I strongly suggest

32:00.127 --> 32:01.920
that you made those
recommendations

32:01.962 --> 32:04.381
based on the promise of monies
from those suppliers

32:04.423 --> 32:07.551
to you, Selfridge.

32:13.390 --> 32:15.517
This is the list that
I gave you, Loxley.

32:15.559 --> 32:17.311
It quite clearly states

32:17.353 --> 32:19.605
that under no circumstances

32:19.646 --> 32:22.566
do you use Kings,
the boot manufacturers.

32:22.608 --> 32:24.193
Who did you use, Loxley?

32:29.698 --> 32:31.075
Kings.

32:33.619 --> 32:37.122
Your own wife is willing
to authenticate this list.

32:37.164 --> 32:39.041
She's also willing
to testify

32:39.083 --> 32:40.584
to huge sums of cash

32:40.626 --> 32:43.420
deposited directly
into your accounts

32:43.462 --> 32:46.423
practically from the moment
that you joined this committee.

32:48.384 --> 32:50.135
What's going
to come out next, Loxley?

32:52.930 --> 32:54.139
Yes, I'm a Yank.

32:54.181 --> 32:57.226
And I'm a shopkeeper.

32:57.267 --> 32:58.811
But I'm a man of honor.

32:58.852 --> 33:00.854
Which is more than I can say

33:00.896 --> 33:04.316
for some of the occupants
of this room.

33:04.358 --> 33:06.318
Good day to you, gentlemen.

33:39.184 --> 33:41.437
Perfect, isn't it?

33:41.478 --> 33:43.313
Honest and true.

33:43.355 --> 33:45.232
Like Miss Towler herself.

33:47.943 --> 33:49.862
Are you in love with her?

33:56.660 --> 33:58.245
Yes.

34:02.124 --> 34:04.418
Take good care of her,
Mr. Colleano.

34:04.460 --> 34:06.295
I am leaving first thing
in the morning.

34:08.505 --> 34:09.630
Good luck, Mr. Leclair.

34:38.243 --> 34:39.870
What is it, Victor?

34:43.331 --> 34:45.501
I'll always love you, Agnes.

34:45.542 --> 34:47.835
I should hope so too.

34:47.878 --> 34:51.089
But I can't marry you.

34:51.130 --> 34:53.091
What?

34:53.132 --> 34:54.676
I can't take you away

34:54.717 --> 34:56.803
from this life you've made
for yourself.

34:56.844 --> 34:58.764
Against all the odds.

34:58.805 --> 35:02.392
You'd come to resent me.

35:02.434 --> 35:05.771
And maybe children
would soften that in time,

35:05.812 --> 35:10.317
but years would pass and your
heart would still be here.

35:10.359 --> 35:14.279
You wouldn't be you, Agnes.

35:14.321 --> 35:16.031
Victor...

35:16.073 --> 35:21.912
The you I fell in love with
is the you I can't have

35:21.954 --> 35:24.456
because a life with me would
mean too many changes for you.

35:24.498 --> 35:28.043
I understood that
my life would change

35:28.085 --> 35:29.878
when I agreed to marry you.

35:29.920 --> 35:32.631
And I'm grateful
for that.

35:32.673 --> 35:35.217
But I would never have
all of your heart.

35:37.469 --> 35:39.429
We both know who does.

35:46.478 --> 35:50.274
You are the loveliest girl
I've ever known, Agnes Towler.

35:52.609 --> 35:55.862
And now I have to let you go.

35:59.074 --> 36:01.952
Go to Henri.

36:01.994 --> 36:04.371
Tell him you love him.

36:06.039 --> 36:09.418
Be happy.

36:11.044 --> 36:12.462
Would you do that for me?

36:16.258 --> 36:18.218
Be happy.

37:01.553 --> 37:03.513
Oh, Mr. Crabb, good news.

37:03.555 --> 37:05.724
Mr. Edwards, Mr. Selfridge
and his family

37:05.766 --> 37:07.267
are on the shop floor!

37:07.309 --> 37:08.477
Excuse me, Harry,
I think you'll find

37:08.518 --> 37:09.770
this interruption
worthwhile.

37:09.811 --> 37:11.730
One for you,
one for you,

37:11.772 --> 37:13.857
one for you,
one for you.

37:13.899 --> 37:15.525
Good news.

37:15.567 --> 37:18.820
The whole of London
is buzzing.

37:18.862 --> 37:20.906
What's going on?

37:20.947 --> 37:22.991
Mr. Selfridge
took on the establishment.

37:23.033 --> 37:26.078
And Mr. Selfridge won.

37:26.119 --> 37:27.454
Kings have admitted
paying Loxley

37:27.496 --> 37:29.790
large sums of money
in exchange for orders.

37:29.831 --> 37:32.459
They say he instructed them
to cut corners.

37:32.501 --> 37:34.127
They're willing to testify

37:34.169 --> 37:35.587
in return for reduced
culpability.

37:38.340 --> 37:41.677
We couldn't ask for a better
Thanksgiving present, Harry.

37:41.718 --> 37:43.261
Thank you.

37:43.303 --> 37:45.347
Members of the
Procurement Committee

37:45.389 --> 37:46.723
are sorely embarrassed.

37:46.765 --> 37:49.017
They've extended an invitation
to you to join the committee.

37:49.059 --> 37:50.268
I said I'd ask.

37:50.310 --> 37:52.437
Tell them I said thank you.

37:52.479 --> 37:53.897
But I decline.

37:55.607 --> 37:57.067
I'm a store man at heart.

37:57.109 --> 37:58.652
That's who I am.

37:58.694 --> 38:00.362
It's what I do.

38:00.404 --> 38:02.197
What will I do
with myself all day

38:02.239 --> 38:04.032
now I don't have Loxley
to worry about?

38:04.074 --> 38:06.243
I'm sure
you'll think of something.

38:06.284 --> 38:08.203
Indeed I will.

38:08.245 --> 38:11.206
Yet once again,
the world is my oyster.

38:13.125 --> 38:15.419
Everything all right, Rose?

38:15.460 --> 38:16.920
We'll speak later.

38:16.962 --> 38:19.256
Just enjoy this moment.

38:19.297 --> 38:20.841
You deserve it.

38:29.099 --> 38:31.101
Well done, Mr. Edwards.

38:31.143 --> 38:34.146
So can we put all this behind us
and start again?

38:35.564 --> 38:37.899
I'll consider it.

38:37.941 --> 38:39.234
Kitty...

38:39.276 --> 38:41.653
Miss Hawkins, you led me
to believe...

38:41.695 --> 38:43.613
What did I lead you
to believe?

38:46.908 --> 38:49.911
You can tell me
over dinner tonight.

38:49.953 --> 38:53.623
When you may call me Kitty
again, if you wish.

39:17.230 --> 39:19.024
Where are you going?

39:19.065 --> 39:20.442
That is not your concern.

39:20.484 --> 39:21.985
I cannot stay here any longer.

39:23.445 --> 39:30.118
If I ask you to stay,
will you stay?

39:30.160 --> 39:32.162
Ask me.

39:35.290 --> 39:38.919
I've been fighting my feelings
for you for stupid reasons.

39:38.960 --> 39:41.838
Other people's reasons.

39:45.425 --> 39:47.552
I don't want you to go.

39:50.555 --> 39:52.015
Please stay.

39:54.392 --> 39:56.186
Please.

40:44.442 --> 40:46.695
How many years since
we all sat around a table

40:46.736 --> 40:48.905
for Thanksgiving dinner?

40:48.947 --> 40:50.657
Come on, hurry up!

40:51.908 --> 40:53.910
Harry.

40:53.952 --> 40:55.245
Yeah?

40:55.287 --> 40:56.621
I've got something
to tell you.

40:56.663 --> 41:00.125
I haven't been feeling
very well lately.

41:00.166 --> 41:02.419
And I know you've asked
a number of times

41:02.460 --> 41:03.587
and I've brushed you off.

41:06.923 --> 41:08.049
Rose?

41:10.135 --> 41:13.555
I think the reason
that I put it off

41:13.597 --> 41:16.725
was because I knew

41:16.766 --> 41:19.394
that there was something
seriously wrong myself.

41:19.436 --> 41:21.646
And now I've been
to see the doctor

41:21.688 --> 41:24.065
a couple of times now,
and, um...

41:27.485 --> 41:29.779
It's my lungs, Harry.

41:29.821 --> 41:33.116
And what the doctors
are saying is that

41:33.158 --> 41:36.369
there really is nothing
they can do.

41:36.411 --> 41:39.581
Rose, sweetheart,
what are you saying to me?

41:39.623 --> 41:42.334
I don't know
how to say this.

41:46.838 --> 41:49.549
I'm dying, Harry-

41:58.141 --> 41:59.351
Henri.

41:59.392 --> 42:00.602
Agnes.

42:00.644 --> 42:02.896
I thought I might
find you here.

42:02.938 --> 42:04.814
<i>'U.</i>

42:04.856 --> 42:07.734
I'm not marrying Victor.

42:07.776 --> 42:11.363
And he told me
to come to you.

42:11.404 --> 42:13.281
Was... was he right?

42:16.785 --> 42:18.203
I love you.

42:18.244 --> 42:21.039
I love you, Agnes.

42:21.081 --> 42:23.625
I've wanted to say those words
for the longest time.

42:29.923 --> 42:31.883
I love you.

42:31.925 --> 42:35.261
You have to come back
to me, Henri.

42:35.303 --> 42:36.513
I will.

42:36.554 --> 42:38.890
I will come back to you.

42:38.932 --> 42:41.101
And when I do,
I'll never leave you again.

42:59.619 --> 43:01.663
We'll see the finest doctors
in the entire world.

43:01.705 --> 43:03.498
There are things
that we can do!

43:03.540 --> 43:05.625
Harry, sometimes
there are limitations

43:05.667 --> 43:07.210
to what any of us can do.

43:07.252 --> 43:08.628
Even you, Harry.

43:11.089 --> 43:12.549
Even you, my love.

43:14.426 --> 43:15.927
But you know
what you can do?

43:15.969 --> 43:17.137
What?

43:17.178 --> 43:18.346
What?

43:20.598 --> 43:23.935
We're going to go downstairs

43:23.977 --> 43:28.523
and we're going to enjoy
our Thanksgiving dinner

43:28.565 --> 43:30.191
with our family
and our friends.

43:30.233 --> 43:32.527
We will give thanks

43:32.569 --> 43:34.654
and we will get through
the evening

43:34.696 --> 43:36.072
just the way I've planned.

43:36.114 --> 43:37.907
We can give them that.

43:39.701 --> 43:41.036
And then tomorrow,

43:41.077 --> 43:42.579
in the morning...

43:44.789 --> 43:48.251
we'll gather the family
together and let them know.

43:51.046 --> 43:53.423
Can you do this
for me, Harry?

43:57.510 --> 43:58.678
Yes.

44:01.848 --> 44:03.850
Thank you.

44:23.036 --> 44:24.996
<i>I give thanks</i>

44:25.038 --> 44:27.832
for this pink chiffon dress
I got in the store today.

44:27.874 --> 44:30.043
I give thanks for my
parents and all they do for me.

44:32.587 --> 44:35.965
I give thanks for us all
being back together again.

44:36.007 --> 44:40.887
A huge, big thanks for us
all being back in London.

44:40.929 --> 44:43.973
I give thanks
the Selfridge name

44:44.015 --> 44:45.558
has been cleared
of dishonor.

44:45.600 --> 44:47.310
Well said.

44:47.352 --> 44:49.354
Mae?

44:49.395 --> 44:51.648
Oh, I give thanks

44:51.689 --> 44:54.067
for friendship
and forgiveness.

44:55.944 --> 44:57.862
Rose, sweetheart?

45:01.032 --> 45:03.993
I give thanks for
all the years of happiness

45:04.035 --> 45:05.954
that I have enjoyed.

45:05.995 --> 45:09.040
With you, Harry.

45:09.082 --> 45:11.876
And with my family.

45:14.212 --> 45:17.215
And you?

45:17.257 --> 45:19.467
I give thanks for the simple,
most important things:

45:19.509 --> 45:20.718
my family,

45:20.760 --> 45:21.970
my friends,

45:22.011 --> 45:25.306
my beloved wife.

45:28.351 --> 45:32.438
And I give thanks
for this moment in time,

45:32.480 --> 45:36.192
which I shall cherish forever.

45:43.575 --> 45:44.701
Amen.

45:45.305 --> 45:51.360
