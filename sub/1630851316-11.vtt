WEBVTT

00:13.665 --> 00:15.145
Routine scan.

00:15.189 --> 00:17.191
Portside, no debris.

00:17.234 --> 00:19.541
No obstruction. Clear.

00:20.368 --> 00:22.239
0200 security check complete.

00:22.283 --> 00:24.111
Horizon all clear.

00:26.896 --> 00:29.029
Well?

00:29.072 --> 00:31.031
Call it in, Carl.
All clear.

00:31.074 --> 00:32.075
We're in the middle of nowhere.

00:32.119 --> 00:33.337
It's never not all clear.

00:33.381 --> 00:34.773
We radio the bridge

00:34.817 --> 00:36.949
every hour regardless.
Read the company policy.

00:36.993 --> 00:40.170
I did, right after they hired me
for an "exciting career."

00:40.214 --> 00:42.172
Defending container ships
around the horn,

00:42.216 --> 00:43.695
treasure-hunting expeditions
in Gabon.

00:43.739 --> 00:45.262
You know, high-risk,
high-value targets.

00:45.306 --> 00:47.786
Instead... I'm here.

00:47.830 --> 00:49.179
This ship is high-value.

00:49.223 --> 00:51.312
Pirates don't come after nerds
studying mud.

00:51.355 --> 00:53.836
Try "environmental
research scientists."

00:53.879 --> 00:57.057
And they're studying
deep-ocean mineral deposits.

00:57.100 --> 00:58.536
Like I said, mud.

00:58.580 --> 01:00.495
Deep-sea mining could be
the next global catastrophe

01:00.538 --> 01:02.801
if we don't carefully
study its effects.

01:02.845 --> 01:04.281
We? You've been eating lunch

01:04.325 --> 01:05.804
with the nerds again,
haven't you?

01:05.848 --> 01:08.068
All I'm saying is that,
in the eyes of science,

01:08.111 --> 01:09.895
this ship's work is priceless.

01:09.939 --> 01:12.202
Well, until pirates start
looting research papers,

01:12.246 --> 01:13.899
I think we're safe.

01:20.080 --> 01:22.734
I wouldn't be so sure.

01:25.955 --> 01:27.478
Who the hell are they?

01:27.522 --> 01:28.914
Call it in. Now.

01:28.958 --> 01:30.220
Security to bridge, we have

01:30.264 --> 01:31.569
an unidentified craft
coming port side.

01:31.613 --> 01:34.398
Suggest an immediate
alert one protocol.

01:34.442 --> 01:36.008
Unidentified craft,

01:36.052 --> 01:39.099
cut your engines
and do not approach

01:39.142 --> 01:40.970
or you will be fired upon.

01:41.013 --> 01:42.537
Identify yourself!

01:42.580 --> 01:45.714
Chief Petty Officer Ian Maddux,
United States Navy!

01:45.757 --> 01:48.673
We request immediate
medical assistance

01:48.717 --> 01:53.113
under the peacetime protocols
of the Geneva Convention!

01:54.331 --> 01:56.638
Call the damn Navy!
We got a man down!

02:40.290 --> 02:42.249
What is she doing?

02:42.292 --> 02:44.076
Paper Pauline.

02:44.120 --> 02:45.643
Paper who?

02:45.687 --> 02:47.993
It's a school project Knight's
helping her niece with.

02:48.037 --> 02:49.125
You take pictures
of a paper doll

02:49.169 --> 02:50.474
in front of different locations

02:50.518 --> 02:53.434
that show kids
new, uh, people and places.

02:54.565 --> 02:56.611
But that's what
the Internet is for.

02:58.613 --> 03:00.223
Okay. Damn it.

03:00.267 --> 03:01.224
Yo.

03:01.268 --> 03:03.226
You okay?
No.

03:03.270 --> 03:05.010
I'm trying to make
a good impression.

03:05.054 --> 03:06.882
I just end up looking
like Mr. Bean.

03:06.925 --> 03:09.058
Jess, you know the photo quality
doesn't really matter, right?

03:09.101 --> 03:10.451
I've done plenty of
Paper Paulines,

03:10.494 --> 03:12.017
and the kids all get
the same grades.

03:12.061 --> 03:14.019
I'm not trying
to impress the teacher.

03:14.063 --> 03:16.848
I am trying to impress
my niece, Mika.

03:17.632 --> 03:19.286
I don't get to see her a lot,
and this is my chance

03:19.329 --> 03:21.026
to prove that I'm the cool aunt.

03:21.070 --> 03:22.376
Oh, that's sweet.

03:22.419 --> 03:23.899
- How old is she?
- Yeah, you know,

03:23.942 --> 03:26.075
she's about, uh...

03:26.118 --> 03:27.816
that old.

03:27.859 --> 03:29.426
You don't know her age?

03:29.470 --> 03:31.036
How do you handle
birthday cards?

03:31.080 --> 03:34.475
I buy her the generic ones
without the numbers on it.

03:35.302 --> 03:36.607
Okay, look, I am...

03:36.651 --> 03:40.002
I'm not really
that great with kids,

03:40.045 --> 03:43.658
which is why it is important
that I nail this project.

03:43.701 --> 03:45.529
Okay.

03:45.573 --> 03:47.183
I got you.

03:48.140 --> 03:50.230
Okay.

03:55.278 --> 03:57.062
What is happening?

03:57.106 --> 03:58.977
Helping you make
a good impression.

03:59.021 --> 04:00.327
Kids love the badge.

04:00.370 --> 04:01.328
And the bulging bicep?

04:01.371 --> 04:02.807
That's extra credit.

04:02.851 --> 04:04.156
Hmm, okay.

04:04.200 --> 04:05.288
Actually, I was
thinking about taking

04:05.332 --> 04:06.724
a whole team photo together.

04:06.768 --> 04:09.423
Maybe at a crime scene.
Kids love dead bodies.

04:11.555 --> 04:13.427
Have you not seen <i>Stand By Me?</i>

04:13.470 --> 04:15.385
I'm thinking that
maybe Paper Pauline

04:15.429 --> 04:16.691
should stay in the squad room.

04:16.734 --> 04:19.476
- I think it's for the best.
- Fine.

04:19.520 --> 04:22.349
We will take a team photo here.

04:22.392 --> 04:24.307
Has anyone seen Parker?

04:24.351 --> 04:27.179
Ooh. German <i>Mandelho√∂rnchen.</i>

04:27.223 --> 04:28.703
- Mmm.
- Baked by a neighbor

04:28.746 --> 04:31.183
who emigrated from East Berlin
after the wall fell.

04:31.227 --> 04:32.359
You know, I was
beginning to think

04:32.402 --> 04:34.448
these Parker pastries
were a myth.

04:34.491 --> 04:37.277
Well, your assistant told me
that you avoid processed sugar.

04:37.320 --> 04:39.844
Well, she's on vacation
this week, which means...

04:39.888 --> 04:41.193
so am I.

04:41.977 --> 04:43.326
Mmm.

04:43.370 --> 04:45.241
I'm pretty sure
you didn't call me up here

04:45.285 --> 04:47.765
for, uh, empty calories,
Director.

04:47.809 --> 04:49.550
Nope. Relax, Agent Parker.

04:49.593 --> 04:51.029
This is not
a formal meeting.

04:51.073 --> 04:52.161
Mmm.

04:52.204 --> 04:53.902
I just wanted to check in.

04:53.945 --> 04:56.252
See how NCIS was treating you.

04:56.296 --> 04:57.949
You've been at the desk
for a little while.

04:57.993 --> 04:59.081
Was it the right move?

04:59.124 --> 05:00.343
Your agency. You tell me.

05:00.387 --> 05:02.432
- I want to hear what you think.
- Well,

05:02.476 --> 05:04.565
this place has been amazing.

05:04.608 --> 05:05.696
Good.

05:05.740 --> 05:07.568
I take it you're happy
with your team.

05:07.611 --> 05:09.352
I'm happy with the team.

05:09.396 --> 05:11.485
The team.

05:12.399 --> 05:13.530
That's what I said.

05:13.574 --> 05:15.663
So, not your team?

05:17.404 --> 05:20.363
Director, these people have been
working together for years.

05:20.407 --> 05:21.625
I've been here five minutes.

05:21.669 --> 05:23.235
I'm not ready to call
anything mine.

05:23.279 --> 05:25.150
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Eh.

05:25.194 --> 05:27.152
It's-it's like dating.
I met someone.

05:27.196 --> 05:28.632
Someone great,
but me and that someone

05:28.676 --> 05:30.330
still have to fall in love
with each other

05:30.373 --> 05:33.507
before we start
sharing bath towels.

05:35.900 --> 05:37.598
Sorry to interrupt, Director,

05:37.641 --> 05:39.426
but there's a secure call
for you in MTAC

05:39.469 --> 05:41.297
from Special Operations Command.

05:41.341 --> 05:43.168
Above my pay grade.

05:43.212 --> 05:46.781
They're also requesting your
senior agents be on the call.

05:48.870 --> 05:50.480
We received a distress call

05:50.524 --> 05:52.961
on an emergency frequency
early this morning

05:53.004 --> 05:54.397
from the North Atlantic.

05:54.441 --> 05:56.356
- Navy ship?
- The call came from

05:56.399 --> 05:57.661
a civilian research vessel

05:57.705 --> 05:59.097
currently studying
mineral deposits.

05:59.141 --> 06:01.491
The <i>Stargazer.</i>

06:01.535 --> 06:03.319
Stargazer.

06:03.363 --> 06:05.626
These researchers sound
like Trekkers.

06:05.669 --> 06:07.062
Yeah. Nice catch.

06:07.105 --> 06:09.760
Something you'd like to add,
Agents Parker and McGee?

06:09.804 --> 06:11.588
Uh, no, Commander.

06:11.632 --> 06:13.373
I was just commenting
that the, uh,

06:13.416 --> 06:18.290
the <i>Stargazer</i> was
a starship on <i>Star Trek.</i>

06:18.334 --> 06:20.249
Specifically, <i>
The Next Generation.</i>

06:20.292 --> 06:22.730
Yeah, I'm more of
an <i>Original Series</i> man, myself.

06:23.905 --> 06:26.734
Well, the <i>Stargazer</i>
that's on Earth

06:26.777 --> 06:29.214
picked up two members
of a black ops team

06:29.258 --> 06:31.216
along with the dead body
of a sailor.

06:31.260 --> 06:32.609
What happened?

06:32.653 --> 06:34.611
That's what NCIS
needs to find out.

06:34.655 --> 06:37.919
There's a helo waiting for you
at Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling

06:37.962 --> 06:39.355
to take you to the <i>Stargazer.</i>

06:39.399 --> 06:41.531
Commander, what was
a black ops team doing

06:41.575 --> 06:43.185
in the middle of the Atlantic?

06:43.228 --> 06:46.014
Information related to
any ongoing operations

06:46.057 --> 06:47.537
is need-to-know.

06:47.581 --> 06:49.539
And we do. It could be
relative to our investigation.

06:49.583 --> 06:52.629
Your investigation
is limited to the body,

06:52.673 --> 06:56.241
until SOCOM can confirm
the nature of this operation

06:56.285 --> 06:58.853
and any national security
implications.

06:58.896 --> 07:00.376
Is that understood, Director?

07:00.420 --> 07:01.943
Of course, Commander.

07:01.986 --> 07:03.423
We'll be in touch.

07:05.555 --> 07:07.688
Nature of the operation?
What does that mean?

07:07.731 --> 07:10.517
It means the commander has
absolutely no idea

07:10.560 --> 07:12.257
what that team was doing
out there.

07:12.301 --> 07:14.738
Even she hasn't been told.

07:14.782 --> 07:16.392
Whatever the mission,

07:16.436 --> 07:18.742
somebody's working real hard
to keep it a secret.

07:27.490 --> 07:29.449
Great. Thank you so much.

07:30.232 --> 07:32.626
All right, Parker
and the rest of the team

07:32.669 --> 07:34.279
just took off
from Anacostia.

07:34.323 --> 07:36.630
Helo should reach the <i>Stargazer</i>
by this afternoon.

07:36.673 --> 07:38.458
- Good.
- I have a feeling that

07:38.501 --> 07:39.937
whatever the black ops team was
doing in the middle of the ocean

07:39.981 --> 07:41.373
was pretty important.

07:41.417 --> 07:42.810
Which is why I want to find out
what it is

07:42.853 --> 07:44.289
by the time our team lands.

07:44.333 --> 07:45.943
I've been digging through
every military database

07:45.987 --> 07:47.902
that I have access to.
I can't find anything.

07:47.945 --> 07:49.556
Keep digging.

07:49.599 --> 07:52.210
- Um, wait, Director.
- Yeah?

07:52.254 --> 07:54.125
Um...

07:54.169 --> 07:56.780
I'm not so sure that we're
gonna be able to find info

07:56.824 --> 07:59.348
on this particular
classified op.

07:59.391 --> 08:02.830
At least not by knocking
on the front door.

08:05.006 --> 08:07.225
Walk with me, Agent McGee.

08:16.191 --> 08:19.760
I think Gibbs would prefer
if you do the honors.

08:21.283 --> 08:22.502
Director,

08:22.545 --> 08:23.851
if we're gonna find anything
on this mission,

08:23.894 --> 08:26.549
we need root access
to DoD files.

08:26.593 --> 08:29.030
And you're asking permission
to sneak in the back door.

08:30.684 --> 08:32.337
I'm sorry, the answer's no.

08:32.381 --> 08:35.079
The last thing we need is
to trigger an IG investigation.

08:35.123 --> 08:37.691
Anything off the books
is off the table.

08:37.734 --> 08:39.083
Right.

08:40.258 --> 08:42.522
However, there might be
another option.

08:42.565 --> 08:43.914
One that involves a favor

08:43.958 --> 08:47.178
from the NCIS cyber team.

08:47.222 --> 08:48.528
The Tech Trolls?

08:49.529 --> 08:51.531
Well, I'm a charter member.
I'm allowed to call them that.

08:51.574 --> 08:54.969
They just finished
a joint operation with NSA.

08:55.012 --> 08:57.537
Made some high-level contacts
over there.

08:58.363 --> 09:01.366
Contacts that may be willing
to share security intel.

09:01.410 --> 09:03.455
You up for a trip
to the subbasement?

09:03.499 --> 09:04.848
Of course.

09:04.892 --> 09:06.676
The Tech Trolls and I
are practically

09:06.720 --> 09:08.243
our own Borg collective.

09:08.286 --> 09:09.549
Sorry, it's, uh...

09:09.592 --> 09:11.725
- another <i>Star Trek</i> reference.
- Ah.

09:16.730 --> 09:19.646
I was always partialto <i>DS9.</i>

09:20.516 --> 09:23.824
Director, are you a Trekker?

09:38.186 --> 09:39.535
Thanks for being
such a good sport,

09:39.579 --> 09:40.623
Lieutenant.

09:40.667 --> 09:41.885
Any time,
Agent Knight.

09:41.929 --> 09:43.495
You know, I did a
Paper Pauline project

09:43.539 --> 09:45.106
for my daughter last year.

09:45.149 --> 09:47.935
The pics I took of the helo
were voted class favorites.

09:47.978 --> 09:49.284
Kind of hard to compete with

09:49.327 --> 09:51.416
a $40-million
piece of machinery, huh?

09:52.679 --> 09:55.290
Can we say
coolest aunt ever?

09:58.685 --> 10:00.948
Oh.

10:00.991 --> 10:02.602
Sorry about the crosswinds,
guys.

10:02.645 --> 10:06.736
Thank you, Nick. You just saved
me a really awkward funeral.

10:06.780 --> 10:09.347
Paper Pauline.
Buried at sea.

10:09.391 --> 10:10.914
I was talking about
my funeral.

10:10.958 --> 10:12.524
If anything happens
to that thing, I'm dead.

10:12.568 --> 10:13.961
If anybody starts to feel queasy,

10:14.004 --> 10:15.092
I keep motion-sickness bags

10:15.136 --> 10:17.399
in the rear storage compartment.

10:17.442 --> 10:19.444
Or if you want some music
to zone out to,

10:19.488 --> 10:21.882
I got anything
from Snoop Dogg to soundtracks.

10:21.925 --> 10:23.013
You let me know.

10:23.057 --> 10:25.407
That's a hard pass,
Lieutenant.

10:25.450 --> 10:26.669
Copy that.

10:26.713 --> 10:28.279
Sure you don't want
an emesis bag, Parker?

10:28.323 --> 10:30.107
I know, you get
motion sickness.

10:30.151 --> 10:31.456
On a boat.

10:31.500 --> 10:33.981
And it's not the motion I got
a problem with, Doc.

10:34.024 --> 10:36.113
It's the memories.

10:45.296 --> 10:47.298
Hey, Sid, Piper.

10:47.342 --> 10:49.474
What's up, guys?

10:49.518 --> 10:51.651
I see it's, uh,
just you two this morning.

10:51.694 --> 10:53.130
Hey, listen,

10:53.174 --> 10:54.175
um...

10:54.218 --> 10:55.567
Director Vance had mentioned

10:55.611 --> 10:56.830
that you guys had recently made

10:56.873 --> 10:59.136
some high-level contacts
at the NSA.

10:59.180 --> 11:01.138
Well, we need to,
uh, figure out

11:01.182 --> 11:04.402
any security threats
that might warrant classified

11:04.446 --> 11:07.362
Navy operations
in the North Atlantic.

11:11.235 --> 11:12.628
Um...

11:12.672 --> 11:14.195
Guys? Hello?

11:14.238 --> 11:17.677
Is Super Special
Agent McGee talking to us?

11:17.720 --> 11:18.939
Affirmative.

11:19.853 --> 11:22.682
Um, am I missing something here?

11:24.379 --> 11:25.728
Because, you know, I-I...

11:25.772 --> 11:27.512
I just came down here to... Yeah, Director Vance.

11:27.556 --> 11:29.732
NSA. North Atlantic.
We got it.

11:33.388 --> 11:35.346
I mean, if you don't want
the assignment...

11:35.390 --> 11:36.696
Oh, no, we'll take
the assignment.

11:36.739 --> 11:37.958
Yeah, we'd love to help.

11:38.001 --> 11:40.003
Okay. Then-then what's
the problem?

11:40.047 --> 11:42.397
Apparently, nothing.

11:46.444 --> 11:47.968
Did I do something wrong?

11:48.011 --> 11:51.058
We'll let you know
when we find something.

11:51.841 --> 11:53.234
Okay.

12:16.083 --> 12:18.389
Chief Petty Officer Maddux.

12:18.433 --> 12:20.217
Special Agent Parker, NCIS.

12:20.261 --> 12:22.393
Welcome aboard, sir. Appreciate
you flying on short notice.

12:22.437 --> 12:25.048
Not sure what the Navy told you,
but time is a factor here.

12:25.092 --> 12:26.876
Well, let's just say
they didn't tell us much.

12:26.920 --> 12:28.225
Then I suggest you
and your team

12:28.269 --> 12:29.574
follow me below deck
to get started.

12:29.618 --> 12:31.054
Lead the way.

12:35.015 --> 12:36.799
For a research ship,
there aren't any researchers.

12:36.843 --> 12:37.887
Where is everyone?

12:37.931 --> 12:39.541
On the mess deck,ma'am.

12:39.584 --> 12:42.022
The one thing military and

12:42.065 --> 12:44.459
the crew never misses chow time.

12:44.502 --> 12:45.460
What about that guy?

12:47.027 --> 12:49.812
- You expecting trouble, chief?
- Oh, don't mind Petty Officer Dutch.

12:49.856 --> 12:51.292
He's just on watch.

12:54.469 --> 12:56.123
Body's down here.

13:01.302 --> 13:02.346
Hold up, Doc.

13:02.390 --> 13:03.608
Is there a problem,
Agent Parker?

13:03.652 --> 13:04.609
Yeah.

13:04.653 --> 13:06.133
Whose blood is this?

13:12.661 --> 13:14.750
Okay. All right.

13:14.794 --> 13:16.447
Easy, chief.

13:16.491 --> 13:18.623
You called us out here,
- remember?
- That's right.

13:18.667 --> 13:20.625
And if you and your agents
want to ever leave here,

13:20.669 --> 13:21.931
you'll do exactly as I say.

13:21.975 --> 13:26.327
Now, weapons on the ground.

13:27.763 --> 13:28.808
- All right.
- Slowly.

13:28.851 --> 13:29.983
Okay.

13:30.853 --> 13:32.246
You win.

13:58.881 --> 14:00.361
Knight! Palmer! Get back!

14:05.061 --> 14:07.107
Remind me why we're being
shot at by the Navy?

14:07.150 --> 14:08.804
I don't think they're Navy.

14:21.382 --> 14:23.079
- How many shooters?
- I count three.

14:23.123 --> 14:24.341
I thought one of them was dead.

14:24.385 --> 14:25.255
I guess he got better.

14:25.299 --> 14:27.388
This whole thing was a setup.

14:29.738 --> 14:31.305
Whoa, whoa.
Don't shoot, don't shoot.

14:31.348 --> 14:34.264
It's our pilots.
- We need to get back to the helo.

14:41.619 --> 14:44.187
Cal.

14:45.275 --> 14:46.233
I got him.

14:46.276 --> 14:47.321
All right.

14:47.364 --> 14:48.975
Knight.
We'll cover you. Ready?

14:49.018 --> 14:51.194
- Yeah.
- Go!

14:54.502 --> 14:56.069
He's dead.

15:07.384 --> 15:08.472
I can't feel my arm.

15:08.516 --> 15:09.647
All right. Just breathe,
just breathe.

15:09.691 --> 15:10.910
It's gonna be okay.

15:11.736 --> 15:13.564
I've only got two shots left.

15:13.608 --> 15:15.740
Same. You?

15:15.784 --> 15:17.786
I'm out.

15:32.801 --> 15:34.890
Where the hell did they go?

15:43.420 --> 15:45.248
Find them.

15:45.292 --> 15:47.076
Hey, Kase.

15:47.120 --> 15:48.991
Have you, uh, heard
from the Tech Trolls?

15:49.035 --> 15:50.950
Oh, last I checked
they were still

15:50.993 --> 15:52.952
combing through NSA reports.

15:52.995 --> 15:55.345
Still nothing
on our secret Navy op.

15:55.389 --> 15:56.607
Hmm.

15:56.651 --> 15:58.261
They seem weird to you?

15:58.305 --> 16:01.873
They work in a windowless room
riddled with RF radiation.

16:01.917 --> 16:03.963
- Weird happens.
- No, this-this...

16:04.006 --> 16:05.268
This was different.

16:05.312 --> 16:06.966
They-they kicked me out
for no reason.

16:07.009 --> 16:09.055
Oh. That. Uh...

16:09.098 --> 16:12.449
I-I don't know
anything about that.

16:12.493 --> 16:13.929
Kase, you're a horrible liar.

16:13.973 --> 16:17.193
Yes, but they made me
promise not to tell you.

16:17.237 --> 16:18.803
What? Why?

16:18.847 --> 16:21.067
Because they want you to
figure out what you did.

16:21.110 --> 16:23.591
Except I have no idea
what I did.

16:23.634 --> 16:27.508
When is the last time
you visited the subbasement?

16:27.551 --> 16:29.945
I don't know, uh, I mean,
it hasn't been that long.

16:29.989 --> 16:32.121
Mm. You sure about that?

16:32.165 --> 16:34.950
Well, I haven't been down there
since Gibbs left.

16:35.864 --> 16:37.648
Or since I was, you know,
leading the team

16:37.692 --> 16:38.954
for a little while.

16:38.998 --> 16:41.304
Then I got shot
and was in the hospital.

16:41.348 --> 16:44.220
You know what? I haven't seen
the Tech Trolls in over a year.

16:44.264 --> 16:45.700
And what were the three of you

16:45.743 --> 16:47.484
planning to do together
last year?

16:47.528 --> 16:49.138
The DARPA robotics challenge.

16:49.182 --> 16:50.574
Oh, my God.
I promised them

16:50.618 --> 16:52.707
I would be on their team,
and I totally forgot.

16:52.750 --> 16:54.491
Ugh, no wonder
they kicked me out.

16:54.535 --> 16:55.797
Ooh.

16:55.840 --> 16:57.016
It's from Piper and Sid.

16:57.059 --> 16:59.540
They sent
a classified NSA report.

16:59.583 --> 17:02.412
Intercepted radio transmissions
from the North Atlantic.

17:02.456 --> 17:05.285
Talking about a Russian arms
dealer targeting U.S. ships.

17:05.328 --> 17:07.069
This is what the Navy wanted
to keep quiet?

17:07.113 --> 17:09.289
Why didn't they just tell us?

17:09.332 --> 17:10.725
Oh.

17:10.768 --> 17:12.335
Director Vance.

17:12.379 --> 17:14.555
Absolutely. On my way.

17:14.598 --> 17:16.383
Navy calling in MTAC.

17:20.213 --> 17:21.866
Jimmy, over here.

17:21.910 --> 17:23.390
All right, hang on,
Lieutenant.

17:23.433 --> 17:25.087
Hang on, hang on.

17:31.224 --> 17:33.443
How is he, Doc?
Bleeding bad.

17:33.487 --> 17:35.793
Upper chest.

17:35.837 --> 17:37.099
What do we do?

17:37.143 --> 17:38.274
- Put pressure right there.
- All right.

17:38.318 --> 17:40.233
- Don't let up.
- I got it. I got it.

17:44.759 --> 17:46.021
- Anything?
- Nothing.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.544
No signal.
These guys must be using

17:47.588 --> 17:48.937
a jammer of some kind.

17:48.980 --> 17:50.330
Well, these guys came prepared.

17:50.373 --> 17:51.374
But for what exactly?

17:51.418 --> 17:54.160
- Agent Parker.
- No, Lieutenant.

17:54.203 --> 17:55.422
Try not to talk.

17:55.465 --> 17:56.727
Okay?

18:02.255 --> 18:05.345
These unlock the ignition
circuit on the helo.

18:05.388 --> 18:06.476
Take them.

18:06.520 --> 18:09.088
Leave me here.

18:10.959 --> 18:13.048
Nobody's getting left
behind today.

18:14.310 --> 18:16.356
Sidebar.

18:17.618 --> 18:20.838
If anyone has any ideas
how to improve our situation,

18:20.882 --> 18:22.840
now would be the time to share.

18:22.884 --> 18:25.800
The way I see it, we need
weapons or reinforcements.

18:25.843 --> 18:27.584
I say we need both.

18:27.628 --> 18:28.759
Maybe one leads us
to the other.

18:28.803 --> 18:30.065
What are you thinking?

18:30.109 --> 18:30.979
I'm thinking they must be
keeping the crew

18:31.022 --> 18:32.241
around here somewhere.

18:32.285 --> 18:33.982
- Might be strength in numbers.
- Yeah.

18:34.025 --> 18:36.158
- If they're still alive.
- Only one way to find out.

18:36.202 --> 18:38.421
Unless anyone else has
any better ideas.

18:39.248 --> 18:42.208
I was gonna suggest finding
a way to amplify antenna gain

18:42.251 --> 18:45.298
on my sat phone
to bypass the signal jammer.

18:47.169 --> 18:50.172
But that's clearly a me project.

18:50.216 --> 18:51.782
Maybe you do your thing,
and we'll do ours?

18:51.826 --> 18:53.741
Copy that. But, hey...

18:54.611 --> 18:56.961
Be careful out there.

19:04.839 --> 19:07.102
Commander Womack,
I'm glad to get your call.

19:07.146 --> 19:08.669
Especially since
I've just been made aware

19:08.712 --> 19:10.584
of a troubling national
security report.

19:10.627 --> 19:11.933
I'm sorry?

19:11.976 --> 19:14.631
NSA has intercepted
radio frequencies

19:14.675 --> 19:16.198
from a Russian arms dealer

19:16.242 --> 19:17.982
operating out of
the North Atlantic.

19:18.026 --> 19:20.942
NCIS should have been read in
on any potential threats.

19:20.985 --> 19:22.204
I would agree.

19:22.248 --> 19:24.163
However, we just received
that intel.

19:24.206 --> 19:27.949
So this report is unrelated
to your classified mission?

19:27.992 --> 19:29.646
There was no mission, Director.

19:29.690 --> 19:31.344
That's why I'm calling.

19:32.997 --> 19:35.043
Commander, I'm sorry.
We don't understand.

19:35.086 --> 19:36.436
SOCOM has since confirmed

19:36.479 --> 19:38.307
that the men that boarded
the <i>Stargazer</i>

19:38.351 --> 19:41.354
weren't part of
any Navy operation.

19:42.224 --> 19:44.226
Are you saying
this team was engaging

19:44.270 --> 19:46.141
- in unauthorized action?
- No, Director.

19:46.185 --> 19:50.189
I'm saying that this is
a false flag operation.

19:51.625 --> 19:53.496
Those men aren't Navy at all.

19:53.540 --> 19:55.846
Then who the hell is
on that ship with my agents?

19:55.890 --> 19:58.066
I don't know.

20:06.988 --> 20:09.991
Whatever happened
to this research crew,

20:10.034 --> 20:12.167
looks like it happened fast.

20:16.519 --> 20:18.260
And it wasn't pretty.

20:21.785 --> 20:22.960
What were they
researching again?

20:23.004 --> 20:25.136
Deep-sea mineral deposits.

20:25.180 --> 20:27.356
Whatever the hell that means.

20:39.499 --> 20:41.936
Three, two, go.

20:43.198 --> 20:45.635
Stop, let me go, let me go!

20:45.679 --> 20:48.072
- Not until you shut up.
- Who are you?

20:48.116 --> 20:50.597
Carl Hammond, Sea Defenders
Protection Services.

20:50.640 --> 20:52.381
- Whisper.
- I'm a security guard.

20:54.296 --> 20:55.341
Who are you?

20:56.864 --> 20:59.693
NCIS. We're here to help.

20:59.736 --> 21:00.955
Why should I believe you?

21:00.998 --> 21:02.391
The last guys
said they were Navy.

21:02.435 --> 21:04.393
They took over
the whole damn ship.

21:04.437 --> 21:06.090
How'd you get away?

21:06.134 --> 21:07.744
I saw an opportunity and ran.

21:07.788 --> 21:09.268
Where's the rest
of the crew?

21:09.311 --> 21:11.270
The terrorists locked them
in a forward cargo bay.

21:11.313 --> 21:13.794
- Terrorists?
- The three guys with guns.

21:13.837 --> 21:15.230
I heard them talking
through the vent.

21:15.274 --> 21:16.710
They said something about
a high-value target

21:16.753 --> 21:18.233
and delivering a payload.

21:20.757 --> 21:22.150
Are we gonna go stop them?

21:22.193 --> 21:24.587
No. We are gonna find
the rest of the crew.

21:24.631 --> 21:25.936
I can show you. Follow me.
Wait, wait, wait.

21:25.980 --> 21:27.329
Why? I-I know this place

21:27.373 --> 21:30.071
like the back of my hand.
This is my spot-- Ah.

21:30.985 --> 21:32.987
You move, he dies.

21:41.909 --> 21:44.390
Hang in there, Lieutenant.

21:44.433 --> 21:46.783
Don't you die on me.

21:49.699 --> 21:51.266
Uh...

22:08.239 --> 22:09.850
It's Parker.

22:13.897 --> 22:15.159
Nice harpoon.

22:15.203 --> 22:16.639
Thank you.

22:16.683 --> 22:18.641
How is he?

22:18.685 --> 22:20.121
He's not good.

22:20.164 --> 22:22.166
I managed to slow the bleeding
a bit,

22:22.210 --> 22:24.125
as long as that bullet
is still inside of him...

22:24.168 --> 22:26.345
Don't you have any tricks
in that medical bag of yours?

22:26.388 --> 22:28.651
I came here expecting
to find a dead body.

22:28.695 --> 22:30.436
I'm not equipped
to save a live one.

22:30.479 --> 22:33.613
Lieutenant Vela here needs
proper medical attention, fast.

22:33.656 --> 22:36.050
Then we better get off
- this ship.
- Really think that's gonna work?

22:36.093 --> 22:37.747
It should.
If we can get

22:37.791 --> 22:39.314
this phone antenna
far enough away

22:39.358 --> 22:40.794
from whatever cell jammer
they're using,

22:40.837 --> 22:42.230
we might be able to get
a signal.

22:42.273 --> 22:43.710
Right.

22:43.753 --> 22:45.581
Then maybe we can
call for help?

22:45.625 --> 22:47.844
Well, it's probably
not strong enough for that,

22:47.888 --> 22:50.586
but we might be able to send
a few text characters to NCIS.

22:50.630 --> 22:52.022
Open the porthole.

22:53.415 --> 22:54.721
All right.

22:55.852 --> 22:57.898
Bon voyage.

22:58.681 --> 23:00.204
Okay.

23:02.119 --> 23:04.165
- A few text characters, huh?
- Yeah.

23:04.208 --> 23:05.601
How's that gonna help NCIS
find us?

23:05.645 --> 23:06.689
Don't know.

23:06.733 --> 23:08.691
Haven't got that far.

23:08.735 --> 23:11.390
Baby steps, Jimmy. Baby steps.

23:11.433 --> 23:14.393
I really hope that Nick and Jess
come back with reinforcements.

23:21.225 --> 23:23.053
Oh, finally. I'm starving.

23:23.097 --> 23:24.925
I'll take two eggs, over-easy.

23:24.968 --> 23:26.622
Hash browns on the side.

23:26.666 --> 23:28.798
I appreciate
a sense of humor.

23:28.842 --> 23:31.322
Although, Arius here
isn't much for jokes.

23:31.366 --> 23:33.803
He prefers
a more direct approach.

23:36.327 --> 23:39.287
You know, you should tell Arius
to kind of lighten up.

23:43.422 --> 23:45.772
Ow.

23:46.642 --> 23:48.427
Where are your friends hiding?

23:59.612 --> 24:00.787
Where are they?

24:04.138 --> 24:05.966
You got something
on your shoes.

24:07.663 --> 24:08.925
He's not gonna stop

24:08.969 --> 24:10.144
until you answer me.

24:10.187 --> 24:11.450
Well, then I hope you have
no plans,

24:11.493 --> 24:12.712
'cause we're gonna be here
awhile.

24:20.633 --> 24:21.982
Nick?

24:22.025 --> 24:24.724
- Nick. Nick!
- Come on.

24:24.767 --> 24:26.290
Get in.

24:26.334 --> 24:28.989
No.

24:31.339 --> 24:34.298
Excuse the blood. Your friend
wasn't very cooperative.

24:36.083 --> 24:37.476
That's Nick for you.

24:37.519 --> 24:39.347
Strong, silent type.

24:39.390 --> 24:41.349
Me? I'm...

24:41.392 --> 24:42.524
I'm a blabbermouth.

24:42.568 --> 24:44.352
So...

24:45.353 --> 24:47.747
- What do you want to know?
- Where are the others?

24:49.009 --> 24:50.489
They're dead.

24:50.532 --> 24:51.925
Dead?

24:51.968 --> 24:53.622
You shot at us.

24:53.666 --> 24:55.972
They got hit, they died.

24:56.016 --> 24:57.887
That's how it works.

24:59.019 --> 25:00.194
You're lying.

25:01.021 --> 25:02.326
You-you think I'm...

25:02.370 --> 25:03.937
You think I want to get
smacked around?

25:03.980 --> 25:06.287
I am telling you the truth.

25:06.330 --> 25:10.509
You took out my team leader
and my medical examiner.

25:10.552 --> 25:12.336
And the other one?

25:13.381 --> 25:14.774
What other one?

25:14.817 --> 25:16.558
NCIS only sent four.

25:16.602 --> 25:18.299
He means the pilot.

25:18.342 --> 25:19.343
That guy?

25:19.387 --> 25:20.519
He doesn't know anything.

25:20.562 --> 25:23.826
It's what he has
that's important.

25:25.219 --> 25:27.134
Right.

25:27.177 --> 25:29.528
You want to get off the ship,

25:29.571 --> 25:32.052
so you need the keys
to the helo.

25:32.095 --> 25:34.489
Good to know.

25:35.751 --> 25:37.448
Clever girl.

25:38.928 --> 25:40.582
Kind of makes you wonder.

25:40.626 --> 25:41.844
Who's interrogating who?

25:55.728 --> 25:57.904
Cute doll.

26:00.254 --> 26:02.996
A gift from your daughter?

26:03.779 --> 26:05.259
A loved one?

26:14.094 --> 26:16.183
Now...

26:16.226 --> 26:18.838
let's try this again, shall we?

26:18.881 --> 26:20.927
This time without the games.

26:23.799 --> 26:25.714
Okay, all right.

26:25.758 --> 26:27.542
Let me know if anything changes.
Thanks.

26:27.586 --> 26:29.413
- Ooh, that didn't sound good.
- Joint Base Anacostia's

26:29.457 --> 26:31.894
been trying to reach the helo
on the <i>Stargazer.</i>

26:31.938 --> 26:33.287
Let me guess. Nothing.

26:33.330 --> 26:35.158
And the ship's comms are down.
Something is wrong.

26:35.202 --> 26:36.769
It could just be interference.

26:36.812 --> 26:38.205
Did Anacostia try

26:38.248 --> 26:41.034
accessing the GPS transponder
on the helo?

26:41.077 --> 26:42.252
Yeah. It's disabled.

26:42.296 --> 26:43.384
Okay, yeah.

26:43.427 --> 26:45.125
We can go
with "something's wrong."

26:45.168 --> 26:46.474
If we can't contact anyone,

26:46.517 --> 26:48.258
we got to get backup
on that ship ASAP.

26:48.302 --> 26:50.870
That might be a problem.
Here, take a look.

26:53.133 --> 26:54.743
There's nothing there.

26:54.787 --> 26:58.094
That nothing is the <i>Stargazer's</i>
last reported location.

26:58.138 --> 26:59.879
- Well, where is it now?
- No clue.

26:59.922 --> 27:01.750
And I don't know how we get one.

27:01.794 --> 27:04.361
Without at least a hint of
which direction they're going,

27:04.405 --> 27:06.320
we're gonna be looking
for a long time.

27:06.363 --> 27:09.758
I just got a Bandium
notification from Parker.

27:12.239 --> 27:14.110
Sun, wine, ship?

27:14.154 --> 27:16.635
- What does that mean?
- I-I got to say,

27:16.678 --> 27:18.941
first blush, it sounds like
Parker's having a good time.

27:18.985 --> 27:19.942
Whoa, whoa, whoa, no.

27:19.986 --> 27:22.379
Yellow, Merlot, boat?

27:22.423 --> 27:24.381
Uh, no, no, no.
It's-it's not Merlot.

27:24.425 --> 27:26.688
Looks more like a Port
or maybe a Ruby.

27:26.732 --> 27:27.950
You can tell by
the bright red...

27:27.994 --> 27:28.951
Wait, no, that's it.

27:28.995 --> 27:30.344
- What's it?
- Port.

27:30.387 --> 27:32.389
Port, as in port side
of the ship.

27:32.433 --> 27:35.828
Sun, port, ship. The sun is
on the port side of the ship.

27:35.871 --> 27:37.351
He's telling us
which way they're headed.

27:37.394 --> 27:39.962
We can use this info
to help track where they are.

27:40.006 --> 27:41.355
Next office game night,

27:41.398 --> 27:43.487
you are totally
my new Pictionary partner.

27:49.058 --> 27:50.669
Last chance.

27:50.712 --> 27:53.715
Tell us where your friends are
hiding or say your goodbyes.

27:55.282 --> 27:56.587
If one of you
doesn't start talking

27:56.631 --> 27:57.806
in the next three minutes,

27:57.850 --> 27:59.155
my buddy Maddux is gonna
come in here

27:59.199 --> 28:01.244
and put a bullet
in both of your heads.

28:02.898 --> 28:05.379
Don't put him to the test.

28:11.385 --> 28:13.256
Hey, you okay?

28:13.300 --> 28:15.998
I'm fine.

28:16.042 --> 28:17.783
You?

28:18.871 --> 28:20.829
I'm-I'm good.

28:25.878 --> 28:28.184
What's so funny?

28:29.142 --> 28:30.752
Parker?

28:31.579 --> 28:32.711
- Oh.
- Parker.

28:33.842 --> 28:36.018
How'd you find us?

28:36.062 --> 28:39.718
Not my first time crawling
through a ship's vent.

28:42.808 --> 28:44.331
I'm sorry I didn't
get here sooner.

28:44.374 --> 28:47.769
All right, what do these,
um, military posers want?

28:47.813 --> 28:50.729
To get off the ship
in our helicopter.

28:50.772 --> 28:52.556
They're looking for the keys.

28:52.600 --> 28:54.384
- To go and do what?
- I don't know.

28:54.428 --> 28:57.344
But they're terrorists who
picked this ship for a reason,

28:57.387 --> 28:59.128
so I don't think they went
through all this trouble

28:59.172 --> 29:00.826
for a peaceful joyride.

29:00.869 --> 29:02.044
Where are they now?

29:02.088 --> 29:03.567
Counting the seconds
before they kill us.

29:03.611 --> 29:07.006
That Maddux guy seems
really excited about that.

29:07.049 --> 29:08.398
Yeah, well, he's gonna be
disappointed

29:08.442 --> 29:09.878
'cause he's gonna have to go
through me first.

29:09.922 --> 29:10.923
Yo, wait, wait.

29:10.966 --> 29:12.141
Where are you going?

29:12.185 --> 29:14.013
To say hi to
our phony frogmen.

29:14.056 --> 29:15.405
There are three of them, Parker.

29:15.449 --> 29:18.844
- All have M4s. You're unarmed.
- I'm aware.

29:18.887 --> 29:20.933
- You can't do this.
- Hey.

29:22.064 --> 29:23.500
No.

29:23.544 --> 29:25.807
They can't do this to you.

29:25.851 --> 29:27.113
Got it?

29:29.724 --> 29:30.899
So, what's your plan, then?

29:30.943 --> 29:32.771
- Haven't got that far.
- Hmm.

29:32.814 --> 29:34.773
Baby steps.

29:44.957 --> 29:46.262
Wait a minute.

29:59.145 --> 30:01.495
Maybe Pauline will be useful.

30:02.452 --> 30:04.454
Time's up.

30:04.498 --> 30:06.369
Open the door.

30:07.893 --> 30:09.242
Hey, fellas.

30:10.199 --> 30:12.158
A little birdie told me
you're looking for these.

30:22.864 --> 30:25.345
I swear he came in here.

30:25.388 --> 30:27.434
He did.

30:28.783 --> 30:30.176
What the hell?

30:32.004 --> 30:33.353
Where is he?

30:34.789 --> 30:36.312
Don't care.

30:36.356 --> 30:38.488
It's time to go.

30:46.148 --> 30:47.149
Here.

30:47.193 --> 30:49.238
Pauline can have
her little leg back.

30:49.282 --> 30:51.023
Thanks.

30:52.067 --> 30:54.200
We got to go.

31:05.602 --> 31:07.387
Damn it.

31:07.430 --> 31:09.476
How did they get the keys

31:09.519 --> 31:10.956
to the helo?

31:11.913 --> 31:13.001
We got to find Parker.

31:13.045 --> 31:15.264
- I'll go below.
- All right.

31:17.919 --> 31:19.138
We were able to narrow
the search grid

31:19.181 --> 31:20.791
using Parker's Bandium message.

31:20.835 --> 31:23.707
And you found the <i>Stargazer?</i> Courtesy of the KZ-Epic

31:23.751 --> 31:25.579
hi-res weather satellite.
This was taken

31:25.622 --> 31:28.016
a few minutes ago.
The helo just left the ship.

31:28.060 --> 31:29.539
- Do we know who's on it?
- Uh, no,

31:29.583 --> 31:31.498
but I can try to get
the satellite's thermal feed.

31:31.541 --> 31:32.978
That may give us more details.

31:33.021 --> 31:35.110
Yes, do it, and-and get
the coordinates of that ship

31:35.154 --> 31:36.546
to Naval Operations.

31:36.590 --> 31:37.896
Sat phone.

31:38.809 --> 31:39.810
Parker?

31:39.854 --> 31:41.073
- You okay?
- It's Knight.

31:41.116 --> 31:42.335
And we're just peachy.

31:42.378 --> 31:44.206
Knight, watch your six.

31:44.250 --> 31:46.513
We have reason to believe that
the men who boarded that ship

31:46.556 --> 31:48.080
are not who they say they are.

31:48.123 --> 31:50.038
Yeah, figured that
when they tried to kill us.

31:50.082 --> 31:51.910
They're gone now.
The three of them just took off

31:51.953 --> 31:54.216
in the helo
with their cell jammer.

31:54.260 --> 31:56.044
Although, we've got
a wounded pilot

31:56.088 --> 31:58.003
- who needs immediate medevac.
- And the rest of you?

31:58.046 --> 31:59.918
Jimmy is with me.
Torres is with the crew.

31:59.961 --> 32:01.267
Okay, where's Parker?

32:01.310 --> 32:02.964
We can't find him.

32:03.008 --> 32:04.966
What do you mean?

32:05.010 --> 32:06.489
I mean, we have looked
everywhere.

32:06.533 --> 32:08.404
Wha-- Look again.

32:08.448 --> 32:09.405
I found him.

32:09.449 --> 32:10.754
Where?

32:10.798 --> 32:12.060
There.

32:12.104 --> 32:13.670
This is the thermal feed

32:13.714 --> 32:15.324
from the weather satellite.
Jess.

32:15.368 --> 32:18.110
you said there were
- three gunmen, right?
- That's right.

32:18.153 --> 32:21.765
Then why are there four heat
signatures on this helicopter?

32:22.853 --> 32:25.291
That's the rear
storage compartment.

32:27.989 --> 32:30.774
What the hell is Parker doing?

32:38.478 --> 32:41.089
Crew muster, cargo bay 2.

32:41.133 --> 32:43.962
Got it.
Thanks, McGee.

32:44.005 --> 32:45.441
How's Lieutenant Vela?

32:45.485 --> 32:47.487
- Our pilot?
- The ship's medic and I

32:47.530 --> 32:50.011
were able to stabilize him
in preparation for medevac.

32:50.055 --> 32:52.535
Which should be landing soon.

32:52.579 --> 32:54.015
- Any word on Parker?
- No.

32:54.059 --> 32:55.495
And McGee said
the helo's transponder

32:55.538 --> 32:57.062
is still disabled.

32:57.105 --> 32:59.760
Well, then how are we
gonna find him?

33:02.284 --> 33:03.329
He's got a plan.

33:03.372 --> 33:05.679
Is that a question?

33:05.722 --> 33:07.028
More like positive thinking.

33:07.072 --> 33:08.464
I mean, he's hiding out
on a helicopter

33:08.508 --> 33:10.989
- with three terrorists all alone.
- While unarmed.

33:11.032 --> 33:12.642
We don't know
who these guys are,

33:12.686 --> 33:14.470
or-or what they're planning
to do with that helicopter.

33:14.514 --> 33:16.690
Well, we do know something.

33:16.733 --> 33:19.867
Our bad guys left this behind.

33:24.524 --> 33:26.091
Read the logo.

33:26.134 --> 33:28.963
"Property of Crasis Group."

33:29.007 --> 33:31.835
The private military contractor?

33:31.879 --> 33:34.055
Yeah, our terrorists
have a day job.

33:36.014 --> 33:39.713
Meet Ian Maddux, Dutch Naga
and Gabriel Arius.

33:39.756 --> 33:42.368
They worked together at
Crasis Group until two years ago

33:42.411 --> 33:44.326
when they were fired
for stealing company property.

33:44.370 --> 33:46.807
Well, didn't stop them.
They've since been suspected

33:46.850 --> 33:48.852
in numerous military thefts.

33:48.896 --> 33:50.071
And each bigger than the last.

33:50.115 --> 33:51.681
Entire shipments of ammo,

33:51.725 --> 33:53.161
weapons, even vehicles.

33:53.205 --> 33:56.034
We're talking millions of
dollars of property, too.

33:56.860 --> 33:58.601
They're not terrorists.

33:58.645 --> 34:00.734
They're professional thieves.

34:02.083 --> 34:04.346
What if this was
their latest heist?

34:05.173 --> 34:06.870
They pretended to be Navy

34:06.914 --> 34:08.872
because they knew
that NCIS would show up

34:08.916 --> 34:10.526
with a $40-million helo.

34:10.570 --> 34:11.919
They didn't take the helicopter
as part of the plan.

34:11.962 --> 34:13.529
That <i>was</i> their plan.

34:13.573 --> 34:15.792
Thieves only steal what
they know that they can sell.

34:15.836 --> 34:17.229
Who's in the market

34:17.272 --> 34:19.970
- for a ten-ton military aircraft?
- Pretty short list.

34:20.841 --> 34:22.538
All right, if we find the buyer,

34:22.582 --> 34:23.887
maybe we find our thieves,

34:23.931 --> 34:25.280
and Agent Parker along
with them.

34:25.324 --> 34:28.109
The NSA report mentioned
a Russian arms dealer

34:28.153 --> 34:29.328
that operates out of
the North Atlantic.

34:29.371 --> 34:30.633
That could be our buyer.

34:30.677 --> 34:31.939
Except that report didn't give
any specifics.

34:31.982 --> 34:33.288
Not even a name.

34:33.332 --> 34:34.898
No, but it gave us
the radio frequencies

34:34.942 --> 34:36.422
that the dealer was using
to communicate with.

34:36.465 --> 34:38.554
So maybe if we continue
to monitor those...

34:38.598 --> 34:39.816
We might pick up more chatter.

34:39.860 --> 34:41.166
Right, we just need access

34:41.209 --> 34:42.906
to NSA surveillance buoys.

34:42.950 --> 34:44.952
How do you feel about
asking the cyber team

34:44.995 --> 34:46.258
for another favor?

35:34.001 --> 35:35.959
What's taking so damn long?

35:36.003 --> 35:37.265
I didn't risk my neck

35:37.309 --> 35:39.572
for your comrade
to suddenly get cold feet.

35:39.615 --> 35:41.182
We had a deal.

35:41.226 --> 35:42.966
Getting off that ship
took longer than your estimate.

35:43.010 --> 35:45.665
He just wants to make sure
we haven't been compromised.

35:45.708 --> 35:47.406
We made it this far,
didn't we?

35:48.363 --> 35:50.539
Be patient.

35:50.583 --> 35:51.845
He'll call back.

35:51.888 --> 35:53.977
Well, until he does,

35:54.021 --> 35:55.631
you and me are staying
right here.

35:55.675 --> 35:57.416
And, this time,
I'm doing the talking.

35:57.459 --> 35:59.331
Make yourself comfortable.

36:17.087 --> 36:20.439
156.0 to 156.6 megahertz clear,

36:20.482 --> 36:21.788
nothing but radio static.

36:21.831 --> 36:23.659
- Same here.
- I got something.

36:23.703 --> 36:25.835
Yeah? What do you got?

36:26.619 --> 36:28.098
Fishing trawlers.

36:28.142 --> 36:30.449
Apparently,
Atlantic cod's in season.

36:30.492 --> 36:33.278
Kasie, you and Piper move up
one channel.

36:33.321 --> 36:34.322
Sid, move up two.

36:34.366 --> 36:35.628
Whatever you say...

36:35.671 --> 36:37.064
boss.

36:46.813 --> 36:49.119
Listen, uh...

36:50.077 --> 36:51.600
I really want to apologize
for not showing up

36:51.644 --> 36:53.123
to the robotics competition.

36:53.167 --> 36:55.082
It was a three-person
- team event.
- Yeah.

36:55.125 --> 36:57.171
- We looked like fools up there.
- You know, it's been one hell of year.

36:57.215 --> 36:59.086
I-I had just taken over... Wait, McGee, stop.

36:59.129 --> 37:00.783
No, no. You're right.

37:00.827 --> 37:03.046
I should not be making... No, no, no.
I think I found something.

37:03.090 --> 37:06.398
Somebody's broadcasting
on 156.8 megahertz.

37:07.747 --> 37:09.705
That's channel 16,

37:09.749 --> 37:10.924
the international
distress frequency.

37:10.967 --> 37:11.925
What's it saying?

37:11.968 --> 37:13.796
Nothing. It's just music.

37:27.419 --> 37:29.377
The theme to <i>Star Trek?</i>

37:29.421 --> 37:32.206
Yeah, and it's playing
on repeat.

37:32.250 --> 37:33.686
Is that supposed to mean
something?

37:33.729 --> 37:35.253
Parker.

37:36.254 --> 37:37.777
It's the theme song
to <i>The Original Series.</i>

37:37.820 --> 37:39.082
Parker's favorite.

37:39.126 --> 37:41.084
He's giving us a way
to help find him.

37:41.128 --> 37:42.260
You mind if I jump in?

37:42.303 --> 37:43.826
All right.

37:43.870 --> 37:48.091
Let's use some radio towers
and triangulate this signal.

38:03.455 --> 38:05.108
I'm gonna get some air.

38:06.371 --> 38:08.068
Leave the phone.

38:10.592 --> 38:13.247
And get me another diet soda.

38:13.291 --> 38:14.683
Get it yourself.

38:29.611 --> 38:31.657
The hell?

38:37.010 --> 38:39.099
Two ways this can go...

38:40.753 --> 38:44.452
You surrender, or we all go up.

38:44.496 --> 38:45.671
Go to hell.

38:45.714 --> 38:47.890
You don't have to answer
right away.

38:47.934 --> 38:49.327
Take your time.

38:51.416 --> 38:53.635
I don't see any backup.

38:53.679 --> 38:55.724
Are you here alone,
Agent Parker?

38:58.074 --> 39:00.860
I got a thing about
letting bad guys get away.

39:00.903 --> 39:03.515
And this was your plan?

39:03.558 --> 39:05.255
How do you expect
this to end?

39:05.299 --> 39:08.476
To be honest,
I haven't got that far.

39:10.348 --> 39:11.871
Baby steps.

39:11.914 --> 39:14.656
Federal agents!

39:15.483 --> 39:16.745
Put your hands in the air!

39:17.572 --> 39:18.660
Put your hands
in the air!

39:18.704 --> 39:21.315
Do it now!

39:23.143 --> 39:24.971
Put your weapon on the ground
and back away.

39:25.885 --> 39:27.234
All right.

39:40.595 --> 39:42.902
Boy, am I glad to see you guys.

39:47.559 --> 39:49.517
No, no.

39:49.561 --> 39:51.954
I will not tolerate
any <i>Voyager</i> bashing.

39:51.998 --> 39:55.741
Okay, Kate Mulgrew deserves
a national holiday

39:55.784 --> 39:57.307
for putting up
with whiny fanboys like you.

39:57.351 --> 39:59.440
Hey, my resistance
has been futile

39:59.484 --> 40:01.573
ever since they brought on
Jeri Ryan as Seven of Nine.

40:01.616 --> 40:03.226
- Uh-huh.
- Okay?

40:03.270 --> 40:05.359
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's this?

40:05.403 --> 40:07.317
I have no idea.

40:12.671 --> 40:14.237
Oh.

40:14.977 --> 40:17.415
"Let's try again."

40:24.422 --> 40:26.075
It's the entry form

40:26.119 --> 40:28.774
to this year's DARPA challenge.

40:30.428 --> 40:33.518
I hope this doesn't become
a habit, Agent Parker.

40:33.561 --> 40:34.910
Catching the bad guys?

40:34.954 --> 40:36.738
Taking unnecessary risks.

40:36.782 --> 40:38.740
It was a calculated risk,
Director.

40:38.784 --> 40:41.003
Then your calculator is broken,

40:41.047 --> 40:42.570
because what you did
was a death wish.

40:42.614 --> 40:43.571
Maybe.

40:43.615 --> 40:45.051
But, one way or the other,

40:45.094 --> 40:47.270
I was getting my team off
that ship.

40:48.707 --> 40:50.143
Your team?

40:59.805 --> 41:02.155
- Scissors.
- Scissors.

41:04.331 --> 41:07.421
Tape.

41:12.644 --> 41:14.341
What do you think, Doc?

41:14.384 --> 41:15.560
Is she gonna live?

41:15.603 --> 41:17.475
Prognosis...

41:17.518 --> 41:18.954
is good.

41:18.998 --> 41:21.391
Hey, that's what's up.

41:22.218 --> 41:25.395
Now, I just need to explain
all these battle scars to Mika.

41:25.439 --> 41:27.441
No, that is the best part.

41:27.485 --> 41:28.529
She's finally gonna get to see

41:28.573 --> 41:30.792
how cool her aunt really is.

41:30.836 --> 41:32.838
Pauline has been through a lot.

41:32.881 --> 41:34.492
I think we all have.

41:35.623 --> 41:37.233
You two doing okay?

41:38.321 --> 41:40.541
We're good.

41:40.585 --> 41:41.803
How about you?

41:41.847 --> 41:43.936
Me? Couldn't be better.

41:44.937 --> 41:47.330
Good. Because we still need
a team photo

41:47.374 --> 41:48.767
with Pauline.

41:48.810 --> 41:50.638
Okay, everybody gather around.

41:50.682 --> 41:52.292
You too, Director.

41:53.989 --> 41:56.296
Okay. Cheese.
