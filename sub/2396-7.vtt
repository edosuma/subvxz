11:26.650 --> 11:29.210
DO YOU THINK I'M THE ONLY GUY
AT HEARST WHO OWNS CLIPPERS

11:29.220 --> 11:31.643
AND SUBSCRIBES
TO GENTLEMANS QUARTERLY?

11:31.650 --> 11:36.587
AND KEEPS A STOCKPILE OF GHB
HANDY, FROM WHAT I HEAR.

11:36.590 --> 11:37.852
THAT WASN'T MINE.

11:37.860 --> 11:40.499
I THINK SOMEONE'S
SETTING ME UP.

11:40.500 --> 11:45.290
OKAY, THERE -- THERE ARE
A COUPLE GUYS WHO OWE ME BIG.

11:45.300 --> 11:47.234
I'LL BITE. WHO?

11:47.240 --> 11:49.299
PI SIG PRESIDENT
CHIP DILLER.

11:49.300 --> 11:50.733
NOT THAT SHOCKED.

11:50.740 --> 11:53.436
DEAN CYRUS O'DELL.
YOU'RE LYING.

11:53.440 --> 11:54.737
BIG BOXING FAN, THE DEAN.

11:54.740 --> 11:56.503
UNFORTUNATELY,
HE CAN'T PICK THEM.

11:56.510 --> 12:00.378
HE HAS A STUDENT AIDE, UH,
PLACE THE BETS FOR HIM,

12:00.380 --> 12:02.075
BUT IT'S THE DEAN'S MONEY.

12:02.080 --> 12:03.479
HE'D LIKE TO SEE ME GONE.

12:03.490 --> 12:05.014
I'LL LOOK INTO IT.

12:05.020 --> 12:06.578
THANKS, VERONICA.

12:06.590 --> 12:08.854
LOGAN'S BRAGGED YOU UP.

12:08.860 --> 12:10.953
I APPRECIATE THE HELP.

12:10.960 --> 12:12.450
[ KNOCK ON DOOR ]

12:12.460 --> 12:13.927
HEY, MERYL, ANY LUCK?

12:13.930 --> 12:16.455
NO. NONE.
I CALLED ALL THE HOSPITALS.

12:16.460 --> 12:17.825
I TALKED TO HIS PROFESSORS,

12:17.830 --> 12:20.697
AND NOBODY HAS SEEN
OR HEARD FROM HIM.

12:20.700 --> 12:24.158
LOOK,
I WAS JUST THINKING.

12:24.170 --> 12:26.809
SULLY TOLD ME
THAT IN HIS PHYSICS CLASS,

12:26.810 --> 12:28.732
THEY'RE WORKING
WITH LASERS.

12:28.740 --> 12:33.416
SO WHAT IF SULLY ACCIDENTALLY
DISCOVERED SOME NEW TECHNOLOGY,

12:33.420 --> 12:36.514
YOU KNOW, LIKE SOME KIND
OF LASER CANNON

12:36.520 --> 12:40.149
THAT COULD ASSASSINATE PEOPLE
FROM SPACE OR SOMETHING?

12:40.160 --> 12:45.484
HE COULD BE RUNNING FROM,
I DON'T KNOW, SINISTER FORCES!

12:46.960 --> 12:51.568
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD
OF OCKHAM'S RAZOR, MERYL?

12:51.570 --> 12:55.438
IS THAT A SPACE LASER?
HAS IT ALREADY BEEN INVENTED?

12:55.440 --> 12:56.998
NO, IT'S A THEORY.

12:57.010 --> 12:59.035
BASICALLY, THE THEORY STATES

12:59.040 --> 13:03.044
THAT WHEN GIVEN A SET
OF POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS

13:03.050 --> 13:04.449
FOR A PHENOMENON,

13:04.450 --> 13:07.669
WE SHOULD EMBRACE
THE LEAST COMPLICATED.

13:07.680 --> 13:09.045
SO...

13:09.050 --> 13:11.814
I GUESS I'M SAYING
THAT IF ON THE ONE HAND,

13:11.820 --> 13:14.516
YOU HAVE SULLY
INVENTING A SPACE LASER,

13:14.520 --> 13:17.956
AND ON THE OTHER,
MAYBE HE WANTS TO BREAK UP

13:17.960 --> 13:21.452
BUT IS TAKING
THE COWARD'S WAY OUT...

13:21.460 --> 13:24.293
YOU'RE SAYING MAYBE
HE'S BREAKING UP WITH ME?

13:25.430 --> 13:27.159
I HOPE THAT'S ALL IT IS.

13:27.170 --> 13:30.799
AT LEAST THEN
I'D KNOW HE'S OKAY.

13:37.350 --> 13:40.319
OH. HEY.

13:42.520 --> 13:43.987
I DIDN'T SEE THE SOCK,

13:43.990 --> 13:46.015
SO I FIGURED THERE WAS
NOTHING NASTY GOING DOWN.

13:46.020 --> 13:47.248
ARE YOU GLEN?

13:47.260 --> 13:49.285
THE MAN, THE MYTH,
THE LEGEND.

13:49.290 --> 13:50.826
WHICH ONE OF YOU
IS MERYL?

13:50.830 --> 13:52.286
THAT'S ME.

13:52.290 --> 13:55.054
FOR REAL? AND THAT MAKES YOU
THE HOT FRIEND.

13:55.060 --> 13:56.960
SO, WHERE'S SULLY AT?

13:56.970 --> 13:59.029
UH, WE WERE HOPING
YOU MIGHT KNOW.

13:59.030 --> 14:02.067
ME? MAN, HE ASKED ME
TO CLEAR OUT FOR THE WEEKEND

14:02.070 --> 14:03.662
'CAUSE YOU WERE COMING DOWN.

14:03.670 --> 14:05.069
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW HIM?

14:05.070 --> 14:06.606
YESTERDAY MORNING.
HE WAS GOING SURFING.

14:06.610 --> 14:08.908
SULLY DOESN'T SURF.
HE'S FROM SACRAMENTO.

14:08.910 --> 14:11.105
THAT'S WHERE HE SAID
HE WAS HEADING.

14:11.110 --> 14:12.407
WHY ARE YOU BACK EARLY?

14:12.410 --> 14:15.516
'CAUSE MY STEPMOM
CONFISCATED MY XBOX.

14:15.520 --> 14:17.715
THE BITCH IS TAKING HER LIFE
IN HER OWN HANDS.

14:17.720 --> 14:19.244
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

14:19.250 --> 14:21.457
PLUS, I FIGURED MAYBE SULLY
DIDN'T NEED THE ROOM

14:21.460 --> 14:23.018
AFTER THE KNOCK-DOWN,
DRAG-OUT

14:23.030 --> 14:25.590
YOU TWO HAD ON THE PHONE
THURSDAY NIGHT.

14:28.860 --> 14:30.396
WAIT.

14:30.400 --> 14:33.335
YOU TWO HAD A FIGHT?

14:36.440 --> 14:39.000
Harmony: HEY.

14:40.610 --> 14:43.443
I JUST CAME BY TO MAKE SURE
YOUR PHONE WAS WORKING OKAY.

14:43.450 --> 14:44.678
IT'S FINE.

14:44.680 --> 14:48.969
I KNOW BECAUSE I'VE
PICKED IT UP A DOZEN TIMES

14:48.980 --> 14:51.619
AND LISTENED
TO THE DIAL TONE...

14:51.620 --> 14:53.611
WANTING TO CALL.

14:53.620 --> 14:55.087
IT'S JUST --

14:55.090 --> 14:58.287
DON'T BEAT YOURSELF UP.
WHAT HAPPENED HAPPENED.

14:58.290 --> 15:00.155
YEAH, BUT...

15:00.160 --> 15:02.196
IT DOESN'T MAKE IT RIGHT.

15:03.430 --> 15:05.295
KEITH, WOULD IT HELP YOU
TO KNOW

15:05.300 --> 15:08.531
THAT MY HUSBAND AND I HAVEN'T
HAD SEX FOR EIGHT MONTHS?

15:08.540 --> 15:12.636
WE'RE JUST TWO PEOPLE
WHO SHARE THE SAME HOUSE.

15:12.640 --> 15:15.074
AND A CHILD.

15:16.180 --> 15:19.149
YES, AND A CHILD.

15:20.680 --> 15:24.446
I'M GOING TO LEAVE HIM, KEITH,
AS SOON AS HE GETS BACK TO TOWN.

15:24.450 --> 15:25.587
THAT'S CRAZY.

15:25.590 --> 15:27.319
NO, IT'S SENSIBLE.

15:27.320 --> 15:30.483
STICKING OUT A LOVELESS
MARRIAGE, THAT'S CRAZY.

15:30.490 --> 15:32.082
I WANT TO KNOW...

15:32.090 --> 15:36.390
THIS THING I'M FEELING,
DO YOU FEEL IT, TOO?

15:36.400 --> 15:37.697
YES.

15:37.700 --> 15:39.827
ABSOLUTELY.

15:39.830 --> 15:42.196
BUT IT'S NOT THAT...

15:42.200 --> 15:43.838
SIMPLE. I KNOW.

15:43.840 --> 15:47.776
IT'S COMPLICATED, AND WE'RE NOT
GONNA FIGURE IT OUT IN A DAY.

15:47.780 --> 15:50.442
LET'S JUST DO ONE THING.

15:58.150 --> 16:00.948
YOU, ME, PALM SPRINGS,
THIS WEEKEND.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.588
TAKE SOME TIME AWAY
FROM NEPTUNE.

16:03.590 --> 16:05.956
JUST SEE?

16:07.230 --> 16:10.063
JUST SAY YOU'LL GO AWAY
WITH ME.

16:17.310 --> 16:18.538
OH.

16:18.540 --> 16:20.576
EXCUSE ME.

16:20.580 --> 16:24.346
NO RUSH, MRS. CHASE.

16:29.320 --> 16:30.844
NICE-LOOKING LADY.

16:30.850 --> 16:32.943
VINNIE...

16:32.950 --> 16:34.656
TO WHAT DO I OWE THIS?

16:34.660 --> 16:38.323
YOU KNOW THAT SHOW
"LET'S MAKE A DEAL,"

16:38.330 --> 16:41.527
WHERE THEY MAKE DEALS?

16:41.530 --> 16:43.168
WELL...

16:43.170 --> 16:44.990
THE FITZPATRICK BOYS
HAVE ME ON RETAINER.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.797
I PRACTICALLY HAVE AN OFFICE
DOWN THERE.

16:46.800 --> 16:48.688
AND THEY GOT
THIS CRAZY IDEA

16:48.700 --> 16:51.009
THAT LITTLE
MISS KENDALL CASABLANCAS

16:51.010 --> 16:52.864
OWES THEM MONEY
AND THAT YOU...

16:52.870 --> 16:54.098
[ LAUGHS ]

16:54.110 --> 16:55.702
...KNOW WHERE THE MONEY'S
HIDDEN.

16:55.710 --> 16:57.871
A WORD OF ADVICE, KEITH -- DON'T
OWE THE FITZPATRICKS MONEY.

16:57.880 --> 17:01.839
SO, WHAT IF INSTEAD OF ME
EXPENDING A LOT OF ENERGY

17:01.850 --> 17:03.841
TRACKING IT DOWN,

17:03.850 --> 17:05.442
WE SPLIT THE RETAINER?

17:05.450 --> 17:09.181
IT'S AS EASY AS YOU whispering
an address in my ear.

17:09.190 --> 17:12.023
I DON'T KNOW WHERE KENDALL IS.
SORRY, VINNIE.

17:12.030 --> 17:13.292
NO BIGGIE.
THAT'S COOL.

17:13.300 --> 17:15.552
LET'S PEEK
BEHIND DOOR NUMBER TWO.

17:17.300 --> 17:19.427
NOW, THIS IS NOT
A VALUE JUDGMENT, KEITH,

17:19.430 --> 17:22.331
'CAUSE, BELIEVE ME,
I HAVE BEEN THERE.

17:22.340 --> 17:24.900
I MEAN, THERE WAS
THIS ONE MARRIED LADY --

17:24.910 --> 17:26.468
SMOKIN'-HOT BLONDE.

17:26.470 --> 17:29.701
CRIED ALL DAY AND ASHED
PALL MALLS ALL OVER MY COUCH,

17:29.710 --> 17:32.770
BUT, MAN,
COULD SHE LAY THE LUMBER.

17:32.780 --> 17:34.418
THIS ONE YOU GOT, THOUGH --

17:34.420 --> 17:39.483
I MEAN, A LADY IN THE STREETS
AND A FREAK IN THE SHEETS.

17:40.720 --> 17:42.210
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

17:42.220 --> 17:44.723
WELL, FIRST...

17:44.730 --> 17:48.120
YOU COULD ACKNOWLEDGE
THE ARTISTRY HERE.

17:48.130 --> 17:49.552
DO YOU REMEMBER
HOW DARK IT WAS?

17:49.560 --> 17:52.723
OPEN APERTURE, FULL ZOOM
FROM ACROSS THE STREET --

17:52.730 --> 17:54.061
STEADIEST HANDS IN THE BIZ.

17:54.070 --> 17:55.867
WHY ARE YOU HERE, VINNIE?
MONEY?

17:55.870 --> 17:59.499
THE GIRL AT THE FOTOMAT USED TO
CALL ME THE HUMAN TRIPOD.

17:59.510 --> 18:01.637
WAIT.
THAT'S SOMETHING ELSE.

18:01.640 --> 18:04.245
HOW MUCH?

18:05.410 --> 18:06.547
HMM?

18:07.820 --> 18:09.219
MMM.

18:09.220 --> 18:12.815
WELL, MR. CHASE
IS PAYING ME TWO GRAND

18:12.820 --> 18:16.950
TO PROVE THAT HIS WIFE
IS HAVING AN AFFAIR.

18:16.960 --> 18:18.325
SO, I FIGURE
YOU DOUBLE THAT,

18:18.330 --> 18:20.195
AND WE CAN ALL
WALK AWAY WINNERS,

18:20.200 --> 18:23.590
EXCEPT FOR MR. CHASE,
OF COURSE.

18:24.430 --> 18:26.625
SOUND LIKE A DEAL, KEITH?

18:42.820 --> 18:44.742
OVER HERE.

18:51.660 --> 18:53.025
YOU KNOW...

18:53.030 --> 18:55.453
YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME ABOUT
THE FIGHT YOU AND SULLY HAD.

18:55.460 --> 18:57.018
IT WASN'T THAT BIG A DEAL.

18:57.030 --> 18:59.123
IT WAS JUST THE LONG-DISTANCE
THING GETTING TO US.

18:59.130 --> 19:02.463
YOU HAVE A FIGHT, AND THEN
HE'S NOT AROUND WHEN YOU FLY IN.

19:02.470 --> 19:05.200
THAT DOESN'T MAKE YOU
THE LEAST BIT SUSPICIOUS?

19:05.210 --> 19:06.563
NO.

19:10.250 --> 19:15.074
THERE.
SCARLETT FROM THE FACEBOOK.

19:15.080 --> 19:16.445
WAIT! WAIT!

19:16.450 --> 19:18.281
AREN'T WE TALKING TO HER?

19:18.290 --> 19:21.088
NOT YET.
YOU MIGHT SPOOK HIM.
SPOOK WHO?

19:21.090 --> 19:23.456
IF SULLY SEES US
WAITING FOR HIM,

19:23.460 --> 19:25.826
HE MIGHT, YOU KNOW,
TRY TO SLIP AWAY.

19:25.830 --> 19:28.719
VERONICA, YOU JUST DON'T GET IT.
SULLY IS IN TROUBLE.

19:28.730 --> 19:33.292
AND IF THIS SCARLETT GIRL
COULD HELP US FIND HIM...

19:39.570 --> 19:41.128
HI.

19:41.140 --> 19:44.177
I'M MERYL.
I'M SULLY'S GIRLFRIEND.

19:44.180 --> 19:46.478
OH. HI.

19:46.480 --> 19:49.017
AND THIS IS MY FRIEND
VERONICA.

19:49.020 --> 19:53.719
SO, YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO
MEET SULLY HERE, AREN'T YOU?

19:53.720 --> 19:55.312
RIGHT. TO STU DY.

19:55.320 --> 19:57.527
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW HIM?

19:57.530 --> 20:01.694
IN PHYSICS LAB,
ON THURSDAY.

20:01.700 --> 20:03.759
WAIT.

20:03.770 --> 20:05.260
HE'S NOT AROUND?

20:05.270 --> 20:06.623
IS HE ALL RIGHT?

20:06.630 --> 20:08.166
ACTUALLY --
DIG THE OUTFIT.

20:08.170 --> 20:11.708
IS THAT FROM DOLCE AND GABBANA'S
STUDY-BUDDY COLLECTION?

20:11.710 --> 20:12.859
VERONICA.

20:12.870 --> 20:14.679
IT'S FRIDAY.
I'M GOING TO A CLUB AFTER.

20:14.680 --> 20:16.773
SCARLETT,
DID YOU HAPPEN TO NOTICE

20:16.780 --> 20:19.669
WHETHER SULLY INVENTED
A SPACE LASER OF SOME SORT?

20:19.680 --> 20:21.216
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE MEAN.

20:21.220 --> 20:23.040
I'M SORRY, MERYL,
BUT SCARLETT HERE

20:23.050 --> 20:26.110
HAS EITHER STOLEN YOUR BOYFRIEND
OR SHE WANTS TO.

20:26.120 --> 20:27.678
THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS.

20:27.690 --> 20:29.885
YOU CAN CHOOSE TO BE A PATSY,
OR YOU CAN CHOOSE NOT TO BE.

20:29.890 --> 20:31.858
Veronica:
AND IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

20:31.860 --> 20:34.522
I NEED TO MAKE THIS POINT
ELSEWHERE IN THE FOOD COURT.

20:34.530 --> 20:37.294
TALK AMONGST YOURSELVES.

20:41.470 --> 20:42.994
DR. LAN DRY?

20:43.000 --> 20:44.001
VERONICA.

20:44.010 --> 20:45.807
HAVE A SEAT.
SHARE A RIB.

20:45.810 --> 20:48.870
I DON'T LIKE
TO GET MY HANDS DIRTY.

20:48.880 --> 20:50.575
HOW'S YOUR APPLICATION?

20:50.580 --> 20:52.104
WELL, HERE'S THE THING --

20:52.110 --> 20:56.069
I THOUGHT ABOUT IT, AND I'M
GONNA PASS ON THE FBI THING.

20:56.080 --> 20:59.379
SO YOU'LL GET MY
"PLAN A PERFECT MURDER" PAPER

20:59.390 --> 21:01.017
ALONG WITH EVERYONE ELSE'S.

21:01.020 --> 21:04.353
I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND.
WHY?

21:04.360 --> 21:06.726
WHY? BECAUSE...

21:07.700 --> 21:09.497
...BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE
I'LL GET MUCH

21:09.500 --> 21:12.594
OUT OF A SPECIAL SUMMER PROGRAM
IF I FEEL I'VE BEEN BOUGHT OFF.

21:12.600 --> 21:15.831
WHY WOULD YOU FEEL
BOUGHT OFF?

21:15.840 --> 21:18.832
I WAS NEVER GONNA TELL ANYONE
ABOUT YOUR...

21:18.840 --> 21:21.138
SITUATION
WITH THE DEAN'S WIFE.

21:21.940 --> 21:25.000
I GUESS I DON'T THINK ANY LESS
OF YOU AS A PROFESSOR.

21:25.010 --> 21:27.717
I JUST DON'T FEEL RIGHT
ABOUT TAKING THIS.

21:27.720 --> 21:30.314
THE INTERNSHIP
FEELS LIKE HUSH MONEY.

21:30.320 --> 21:32.140
TAKE THE INTERNSHIP.

21:32.150 --> 21:33.856
THERE'S NO
QUID PRO QUO HERE.

21:33.860 --> 21:35.851
I'M NOT WORRIED
ABOUT WHAT YOU MIGHT SAY

21:35.860 --> 21:37.623
ABOUT WHAT YOU SAW
AT THE GRAND.

21:37.630 --> 21:39.188
THIS IS ABOUT NOTHING MORE
OR LESS

21:39.190 --> 21:42.250
THAN THE FACT THAT YOU ARE,
BY FAR, MY STRONGEST STUDENT.

21:42.260 --> 21:43.966
FORGET ME, VERONICA.
THINK ABOUT YOU.

21:43.970 --> 21:46.188
THINK ABOUT HOW THIS WOULD LOOK
ON YOUR RSUM.

21:46.200 --> 21:47.736
MY RSUM?

21:47.740 --> 21:49.662
THREE MORE YEARS, AND THAT'S ALL
THAT'S GONNA MATTER

21:49.670 --> 21:51.433
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED HERE.

21:51.440 --> 21:54.534
THINK IT OVER.

21:54.540 --> 21:58.476
OKAY. CONSIDER MY MIND BLOWN...

22:00.850 --> 22:05.389
...AND THEN PUT BACK TOGETHER
AND BLOWN AGAIN.

22:08.390 --> 22:10.858
YO, ROOM DOG.
WHAT UP?

22:10.860 --> 22:13.351
