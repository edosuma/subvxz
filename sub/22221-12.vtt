WEBVTT

00:02.420 --> 00:06.834
No! No! I will not be a
slave to your hormones.
-Aeryn!

00:06.924 --> 00:10.337
It's you, | find pleasing.

00:10.428 --> 00:12.965
Chiana:
Two drops from these little
vials

00:13.055 --> 00:16.013
and we can tell if our DNA's
compatible for children.

00:16.100 --> 00:19.308
It's a whole world designed for
your rutting instincts.

00:19.395 --> 00:20.145
No!

00:20.229 --> 00:21.844
Please.

00:24.525 --> 00:26.186
Tyno:
You kissed our Princess.

00:26.277 --> 00:30.566
Yeah, what the hell
does that mean?
-I want you to consider marrying her.

00:30.656 --> 00:32.157
( both screaming )

00:32.241 --> 00:36.280
You will rule, not because
you desire it Clavor,

00:36.370 --> 00:38.952
but because I do.

00:39.040 --> 00:43.124
If you're not going to be king,
Clavor, I'm not going
to marry you.

00:43.211 --> 00:46.169
Aeryn:
When's the last time you
saw a Scarran on a diplomatic mission?

00:49.217 --> 00:50.457
What is it, Pilot?

00:50.551 --> 00:52.337
The Builders.

00:52.428 --> 00:54.293
Moya's creators.

00:54.388 --> 00:57.346
You must exchange espousals.
-But I love you.

00:57.433 --> 01:01.847
After we're married, and I mean
right after we're married, they
turn us into statues.

01:01.938 --> 01:03.894
Oh, hello, Crichton.

01:03.981 --> 01:06.438
My daughter or that
abomination.

01:06.525 --> 01:07.560
Choose.

01:07.652 --> 01:10.018
He's in my head.

01:10.112 --> 01:12.319
He scares me Aeryn,
and I can't shake it.

01:12.406 --> 01:13.657
I don't know what you're
talking about

01:13.741 --> 01:16.278
but there's never been anything
we couldn't overcome together.

01:16.369 --> 01:17.358
Except each other.

01:17.453 --> 01:20.411
Princess, will you consent
to marry me?

01:22.124 --> 01:23.375
Yes.

01:25.503 --> 01:28.370
Here's your wedding present
from Prince Clavor.

01:29.674 --> 01:30.914
( screaming )

01:31.008 --> 01:32.999
Now on Farscape...

02:02.540 --> 02:04.280
Which branch are you with?

02:05.710 --> 02:07.496
Which branch?

02:11.132 --> 02:15.967
Jenavian Chatto, Disrupter,
Peacekeeper Special
Directorate.

02:17.179 --> 02:19.306
Which branch?

02:19.390 --> 02:21.631
You should know I can't
tell you that.

02:21.726 --> 02:23.341
Frell.

02:24.312 --> 02:27.600
Trust them to send in backup
and not tell me.

02:27.690 --> 02:31.399
Yeah, well if it makes you feel
any better, they did the
same thing to me.

02:34.530 --> 02:36.111
So, what's your assignment?

02:36.198 --> 02:39.656
Stay close to Prince Clavor,
my vapid little fiance.

02:39.744 --> 02:43.202
And if he assumes the crown,
kill him.

02:43.289 --> 02:44.529
Well that makes sense.

02:44.623 --> 02:46.284
I admire your dedication.

02:46.375 --> 02:50.288
lwouldn't let them make me
a statue for 80 cycles.

02:50.379 --> 02:53.086
Interesting coincidence.
I was just having the
same thought.

02:55.259 --> 02:57.124
Are you wavering?

02:59.388 --> 03:00.719
And if I am?

03:02.725 --> 03:07.310
Would you hesitate to kill me
if I jeopardized the mission?

03:09.982 --> 03:12.143
Jenavian, right?

03:12.985 --> 03:14.361
Thanks.

03:22.787 --> 03:24.948
My name is John Crichton,
an astronaut.

03:25.039 --> 03:28.202
A radiation wave hit and I got
shot through a wormhole.

03:28.292 --> 03:31.204
Now I'm lost in some distant
part of the universe on a ship,

03:31.295 --> 03:34.628
a living ship, full of strange
alien life-forms.

03:34.715 --> 03:35.465
Help me.

03:35.549 --> 03:37.005
Listen, please.

03:37.093 --> 03:38.924
Is there anybody out there
who can hear me?

03:39.011 --> 03:43.345
I'm being hunted by an insane
military commander.

03:43.432 --> 03:45.548
I'm doing everything I can.

03:45.643 --> 03:48.476
I'm just looking for
a way home.

04:07.331 --> 04:08.741
How you doing?

04:09.667 --> 04:10.782
Get away from me. How dare you?

04:10.876 --> 04:13.333
You want a piece of me, hmm?
Want a piece?

04:13.421 --> 04:16.254
Help, guards, help!
-No, no, no, no.

04:16.340 --> 04:19.002
Guards are taking five so the
brothers-in-law can get to
know one another.

04:19.093 --> 04:22.506
Look, I'm sorry. If someone
tried to kill you using my
name, they will pay!

04:22.596 --> 04:24.177
You're pathetic.

04:25.182 --> 04:27.639
You cannot strike me.
I am royalty!

04:29.103 --> 04:30.593
(groaning)

04:31.564 --> 04:32.553
What do you want?

04:32.648 --> 04:34.309
Jena:
Nothing, darling.

04:34.900 --> 04:37.607
I want off this planet.

04:37.695 --> 04:41.233
Now you're going to find a way
to get Scorpius off my back.

04:41.323 --> 04:42.859
Jena:
Have we company?

04:42.950 --> 04:46.033
Your sister, she gets to
marry who she wants.

04:47.830 --> 04:49.115
And you get to be king.

04:49.206 --> 04:52.824
Jena:
Clavor, I'm trying to bathe.

04:52.918 --> 04:55.705
Oh my, the future Mrs. Valiant.

04:55.796 --> 04:58.412
We're just getting to
know one another.

04:58.507 --> 05:01.089
You should get dressed.

05:01.177 --> 05:03.384
Do not try to kill me again.

05:04.346 --> 05:06.211
It makes me angry.

05:07.308 --> 05:08.844
Is everything all right?

05:11.353 --> 05:13.389
He needs a bath and a hug.

05:14.773 --> 05:16.388
Get my mother.

05:17.234 --> 05:18.849
Get my mother!

05:21.238 --> 05:23.320
D'Argo:
I demand better
protection for him.

05:23.407 --> 05:25.489
You cannot assault a member
of the ruling house.

05:25.576 --> 05:26.986
Well, he was trying to
have me killed.

05:27.077 --> 05:29.329
You bitch slapped the trill.
-I did, yes.

05:29.413 --> 05:31.028
We could find no evidence
of an attack.

05:31.123 --> 05:33.079
Look, the same weapon
that they used on me

05:33.167 --> 05:35.249
was used to disintegrate
the assailants, okay?

05:35.336 --> 05:37.918
By a mysterious savior you
can't identify.

05:38.005 --> 05:40.838
l was having my ass wiped
across the floor.
I did not take time...

05:40.925 --> 05:42.256
Are you doubting Crichton?

05:42.343 --> 05:44.584
Well, it is a weird story.
-You are not helping. -Chiana!

05:44.678 --> 05:46.418
I will upgrade security.

05:46.514 --> 05:51.349
I will alert the Empress but I
will not accuse the Prince of
treason without proof.

05:52.436 --> 05:55.553
But you believe me, don't you?

05:55.648 --> 05:59.140
The reason your charges against
the Prince will be met
with skepticism

05:59.235 --> 06:02.272
is that the Empress, and,
by extension the entire
royal family,

06:02.363 --> 06:04.194
abhors personal violence.

06:07.535 --> 06:09.241
Follow me.

06:18.087 --> 06:19.372
( door slams )

06:20.256 --> 06:23.464
You humiliated me.

06:23.551 --> 06:26.714
That's enough, okay?
You have made your point.

06:26.804 --> 06:28.795
ldon't think l have.

06:28.889 --> 06:33.053
Clavor went to my mother and
detailed your obnoxious
behavior.

06:33.143 --> 06:34.883
My obnoxious behavior?

06:34.979 --> 06:36.435
Yes.

06:37.856 --> 06:43.067
My brother poisoned my DNA,
I know, I am not a fool.

06:43.153 --> 06:44.609
But he would never kill anyone.

06:44.697 --> 06:45.937
Well, a Scarran might.

06:46.031 --> 06:47.316
They are playmates,
you know that.

06:47.408 --> 06:50.616
Look, if you don't want to
marry me, just say so.

06:50.703 --> 06:52.568
I already said so.

06:52.663 --> 06:56.247
Lady, we have been over this
ground with a backhoe.

06:56.333 --> 06:57.709
It works for both of us.

06:57.793 --> 07:01.285
It saves my life,
it saves your ass.

07:02.631 --> 07:05.794
Okay, I did deserve that.

07:05.884 --> 07:08.421
My mother now considers
you unstable.

07:08.512 --> 07:10.252
Hmm.

07:10.347 --> 07:12.963
She wants more medical tests.

07:13.058 --> 07:14.343
Katralla, listen to me.

07:14.435 --> 07:17.347
Your brother sent men
to kill me.

07:17.438 --> 07:21.647
Now John cannot marry Katralla
if John is not alive.

07:21.734 --> 07:25.852
Clavor is weak.

07:25.946 --> 07:29.780
I cannot believe that he
would participate in
such a heinous act.

07:30.451 --> 07:32.442
That means you're lying.

07:32.536 --> 07:36.575
And if so, I can't marry you.

07:36.665 --> 07:38.621
Pilot:
Zhaan, there's no doubt.

07:38.709 --> 07:41.496
The smoke tendril has
definitely invaded Moya.

07:41.587 --> 07:42.918
Where, Pilot? Which way?

07:43.005 --> 07:44.370
Directly above you.

07:44.465 --> 07:46.421
Moving into the Maintenance Bay.

07:55.267 --> 07:58.759
Pilot?
-Still moving through
Moya's ducts overhead.

08:00.189 --> 08:01.599
Down the wall.

08:01.690 --> 08:03.555
Where? Which wall?

08:04.401 --> 08:06.016
Pilot, where?

08:08.155 --> 08:09.691
(chirping)

08:28.258 --> 08:32.126
Ka-Ii-ta-na nash-po-nay,
ka-li-ta-na nash-po-nay...

08:32.221 --> 08:34.257
Be calm, priest.

08:34.348 --> 08:38.512
lam the ship's deity,
not yours.

08:38.602 --> 08:40.809
Then you must be one of
the ship's builders.

08:40.896 --> 08:43.182
One of those who gave
Leviathans intelligence.

08:43.273 --> 08:46.936
Anybody can give a machine
intelligence.

08:47.027 --> 08:49.985
We gave her a soul.

08:51.907 --> 08:53.989
Then I welcome you aboard.

08:57.538 --> 09:00.120
l have been through
Moya's system.

09:00.207 --> 09:02.414
She is in good health.

09:03.293 --> 09:05.284
And she has given birth.

09:05.379 --> 09:07.836
Zhaan:
To a male offspring
named Talyn.

09:07.923 --> 09:09.288
A gunship.

09:09.383 --> 09:10.748
Not of her choosing.

09:10.843 --> 09:13.129
While held captive against...

09:13.220 --> 09:16.053
Pilots do not speak to Kahaynu.

09:16.682 --> 09:18.172
A capricious deity.

09:18.267 --> 09:23.603
We created these beasts as
emissaries of peace.

09:23.689 --> 09:26.146
Then you have succeeded,
Kahaynu.

09:26.233 --> 09:27.973
Moya is a gentle soul.

09:28.068 --> 09:33.859
And is able to reproduce ships
that can dispense carnage.

09:33.949 --> 09:38.283
I am here to decommission Moya.

09:38.370 --> 09:40.986
To end her existence.

09:41.081 --> 09:43.197
Aeryn:
Honestly, Chiana, as long
as Crichton's all right,

09:43.292 --> 09:44.873
I don't know what else
I can do.

09:47.004 --> 09:49.416
He's already made his decision.

09:49.506 --> 09:52.168
He needs us now.
He needs you.

09:52.259 --> 09:54.966
He needs more bodyguards,
and you said that's happening.

09:55.053 --> 09:56.429
Have you even told him
how you feel?

09:56.513 --> 09:58.219
He knows what he needs to know.

09:58.307 --> 10:00.514
Look Aeryn, all men are
stupid, okay?

10:00.601 --> 10:04.014
Men, stupid. If you want them
to know something, you've
got to tell them.

10:04.104 --> 10:05.810
I trust I'm not disturbing you,

10:05.898 --> 10:11.143
but I'm planning a trip to the
edge of the Barren Lands,

10:11.236 --> 10:14.023
to watch the pelgrinos migrate,
and thought...

10:14.114 --> 10:17.572
No, thank you.

10:17.659 --> 10:23.279
I sense unhappiness that
your friend Crichton is
marrying our Princess.

10:23.373 --> 10:25.204
Oh, yes? And why would that
make me unhappy?

10:25.292 --> 10:28.125
I simply offer myself
as a diversion.

10:28.212 --> 10:30.168
( scoffing )

10:30.255 --> 10:33.622
Besides, you never know.

10:33.717 --> 10:36.880
We could be extremely
compatible.

10:47.022 --> 10:48.011
(water splashing)

10:48.106 --> 10:50.062
Now, don't feel bad.

10:50.150 --> 10:52.391
It's not you, it's me.

10:52.486 --> 10:54.192
ldon't like you.

10:55.531 --> 10:57.362
Well...

10:57.449 --> 10:59.861
You certainly have made
your feelings clear.

10:59.952 --> 11:01.283
Mm-hmm.

11:07.751 --> 11:10.868
So now you want to marry?

11:10.963 --> 11:14.751
Well, it works for
the situation.

11:14.842 --> 11:18.881
Look, John, I'd like to
believe you.

11:18.971 --> 11:23.305
But our investigators have
uncovered no trace of the
events you describe.

11:23.392 --> 11:26.179
What about the guard that was
killed when they came after me?

11:26.270 --> 11:27.305
Where's he?

11:27.396 --> 11:28.727
He could be anywhere.

11:28.814 --> 11:32.306
Yeah, he's everywhere.
He's in Heaven.

11:32.401 --> 11:34.642
(mechanical beeping )

11:36.363 --> 11:38.354
Do we know this?

11:39.241 --> 11:42.074
I've never seen anything
like it before.

11:43.120 --> 11:45.281
Obi-Wan had one.

11:46.456 --> 11:49.072
Except his was a lot smaller.

11:50.919 --> 11:52.830
( beeping )

11:57.301 --> 11:59.041
John, it's locked!

11:59.136 --> 12:00.171
What?

12:00.262 --> 12:01.468
Hello?

12:01.555 --> 12:03.546
Hello, can anyone hear me?

12:03.640 --> 12:04.971
Open the door!

12:05.058 --> 12:06.047
Hello?

12:06.143 --> 12:07.258
Get down!
-He|p! Can anyone hear?

12:07.352 --> 12:08.387
Get down!

12:09.354 --> 12:10.434
Hello!

12:13.358 --> 12:14.268
Hello!

12:14.359 --> 12:15.610
Open the door!

12:16.987 --> 12:18.272
Katralla!

12:19.281 --> 12:20.646
Get down!

12:20.741 --> 12:23.323
Is there another way out?
-I don't think so.

12:23.410 --> 12:25.275
Just keep your face to the
floor, shallow breaths.

12:25.370 --> 12:27.702
(coughing)

12:28.582 --> 12:29.992
John.

12:39.426 --> 12:40.506
This way.

12:40.594 --> 12:41.709
What?

12:41.803 --> 12:44.260
Come on. This way.

12:45.390 --> 12:47.130
Katralla, come on.

12:53.523 --> 12:57.266
( coughing ):
I doubted you. I'm sorry.

12:57.361 --> 12:58.567
Oh, it's all right.

12:58.654 --> 13:01.691
It's just a burden being
right all the time.

13:01.782 --> 13:04.899
(coughing)

13:05.619 --> 13:08.281
Your word is worthy.

13:08.372 --> 13:10.454
I will marry you.

13:10.540 --> 13:13.327
That's unacceptable,
Dominar Rygel.

13:13.418 --> 13:16.785
John Crichton may not
leave this planet, but
I will protect him.

13:16.880 --> 13:17.995
( chuckles )

13:18.090 --> 13:20.456
I've noticed how efficient
that is.

13:20.550 --> 13:22.051
Security was tripled.

13:22.135 --> 13:23.341
This device was unknown to us.

13:23.428 --> 13:25.589
There was no way we could
predict its application.

13:25.681 --> 13:28.093
You know why it's
unknown to you?

13:28.183 --> 13:29.684
Because it's probably Scarran.

13:29.768 --> 13:32.430
The same Scarran who's in
conspiracy with your son.

13:32.521 --> 13:35.513
Silence. You may have once
ruled 600 billion,

13:35.607 --> 13:37.689
but you will not
besmirch my son's name.

13:37.776 --> 13:38.891
(snons)

13:38.986 --> 13:40.851
Aren't we past that, Novia?

13:40.946 --> 13:44.530
You posture and deny any
longer, and we both lose
what we want.

13:44.616 --> 13:46.572
If Crichton leaves,
he will flee.

13:46.660 --> 13:50.494
Not if you control the
situation.

13:50.580 --> 13:52.161
Stash him somewhere.

13:52.249 --> 13:54.365
Moya's gone.
He's got nowhere to go.

13:54.459 --> 13:59.749
At least give yourself time to
identify the conspirators,
other than your son.

13:59.840 --> 14:00.920
( chuckles )

14:01.008 --> 14:02.339
(sighs)

14:05.262 --> 14:06.968
Are you familiar with the
Jakench race?

14:07.055 --> 14:10.343
The little green creature
who saved Crichton and
your daughter?

14:10.434 --> 14:14.052
Precisely.
Her Elders Council has sent a
ship filled with wedding gifts.

14:14.146 --> 14:15.636
lt orbits unattended, unnoticed.

14:15.731 --> 14:17.267
(chuckling)

14:17.357 --> 14:18.938
Excellent thinking.

14:19.026 --> 14:22.484
Do you employ a detail of
guards above treason?

14:22.571 --> 14:24.607
I shall send my very
own paladins.

14:24.698 --> 14:27.189
I propose we tell no one.

14:27.284 --> 14:30.117
Not my shipmates or
your daughter.

14:30.203 --> 14:33.286
Let them all think that
Crichton's disappeared.

14:33.373 --> 14:34.658
(chuckling)

14:35.375 --> 14:37.206
Throw them off the scent.

14:37.294 --> 14:41.253
Encourage those who are
intent on assassination
to grow careless.

14:41.339 --> 14:42.670
Precisely.

14:42.758 --> 14:45.215
You are most wise, Empress.

14:45.302 --> 14:48.089
And you are most
manipulative, Dominar.

14:48.180 --> 14:50.136
(chuckling)

14:50.223 --> 14:53.556
This servant. You trust it?

14:53.643 --> 14:55.383
With my secrets and my life.

14:55.479 --> 14:57.185
ro-NA will not betray us.

14:57.272 --> 14:59.183
(electronic humming)

15:03.445 --> 15:04.434
Something wrong?

15:04.529 --> 15:07.145
It's so much currency.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.947
One quarter down payment for
your excellent services.

15:10.035 --> 15:12.196
Three times as much...

15:12.287 --> 15:14.619
upon completion of
your assignment.

15:17.876 --> 15:19.412
(sighs)

15:20.879 --> 15:22.870
Do you know what this is?

15:22.964 --> 15:25.956
A Trans-Sequence-ldent Wafer.

15:26.051 --> 15:27.291
Do you know what to do with it?

15:27.385 --> 15:28.135
Yes.

15:28.220 --> 15:28.800
Good.

15:28.887 --> 15:30.297
( squeals )

15:30.388 --> 15:33.004
I predict that very shortly

15:33.100 --> 15:36.263
you'll be the wealthiest Jakench
in this part of the galaxy.

15:36.353 --> 15:37.638
Thank you.

15:40.315 --> 15:41.851
Interesting creature.

15:41.942 --> 15:43.182
Pitiful, really.

15:43.276 --> 15:46.894
Notify Lieutenant Braca that at
the conclusion of his mission,

15:46.988 --> 15:48.774
There are to be no...

15:48.865 --> 15:51.277
witnesses left behind.

15:57.207 --> 16:01.200
Oh, to be there when the scales
fall from John Crichton's eyes.

16:01.294 --> 16:02.579
( snarls )

16:04.464 --> 16:05.670
I take it, we are clear.

16:05.757 --> 16:06.963
No one following.

16:07.050 --> 16:08.381
You show the way.

16:08.468 --> 16:11.210
Dominar Rygel said you must
insert this before ascending.

16:11.304 --> 16:13.465
I've already altered our
trans-sequence identity code.

16:13.557 --> 16:15.422
We won't track as a
Leviathan Transport Pod.

16:15.517 --> 16:19.226
He said it was a last minute
security procedure in case
we've been compromised.

16:19.312 --> 16:21.223
I'm sorry. I don't understand
these things.

16:21.314 --> 16:23.976
I do not like skipping out
without people knowing.

16:24.067 --> 16:25.603
I thought that was the point.

16:25.694 --> 16:28.811
The point is to hide from my
enemies, not my friends.

16:28.905 --> 16:32.523
Your Highness, the two attempts
on your life demand
extreme security.

16:32.617 --> 16:37.236
And counselor Tyno will be
looking for this new code on
his tracking screen.

16:37.998 --> 16:39.113
All right.

16:39.207 --> 16:40.117
Thank you.

16:40.208 --> 16:42.950
(electronic beeps and buzzes )

16:43.044 --> 16:45.000
Buckle in, boys and girls.

16:45.088 --> 16:47.545
Emergency exits, hamman side.

16:48.258 --> 16:49.919
I'm driving.

16:57.058 --> 16:58.013
Zhaan:
Pilot!

16:58.101 --> 16:59.887
You must arrest her actions.

16:59.978 --> 17:01.559
Moya cannot be doing
this willingly.

17:01.646 --> 17:04.729
She is shutting her own systems
down in sequence.

17:04.816 --> 17:07.228
I cannot override.

17:07.319 --> 17:08.980
Zhaan:
Moya!

17:09.070 --> 17:11.277
Hear me!

17:11.364 --> 17:14.106
Whatever this Kahaynu
has done to you,

17:14.201 --> 17:17.364
it is not in your
self-interest.

17:19.414 --> 17:20.995
How egocentric.

17:21.082 --> 17:24.040
As if your way were
the only way.

17:24.127 --> 17:26.243
I am a priest.

17:26.338 --> 17:31.833
I have long ago come to terms
with the idea that alien life
practices alien ritual.

17:31.927 --> 17:34.509
But all life cherishes life.

17:34.596 --> 17:38.214
Moya can reproduce gunships.

17:38.308 --> 17:40.424
Moya must be decommissioned.

17:40.518 --> 17:44.227
She trusts my suggestion
to guide her.

17:44.314 --> 17:49.229
You will never convince me that
Moya is doing this willingly.

17:49.319 --> 17:51.935
Then let her do it.

17:55.909 --> 17:58.366
Moya:
Moya...

17:59.246 --> 18:02.704
fulfilled...

18:02.791 --> 18:04.122
Moya?

18:04.209 --> 18:07.667
Moya...

18:07.754 --> 18:10.211
Go...

18:11.258 --> 18:13.965
Willing...

18:15.220 --> 18:17.677
Willing...

18:19.641 --> 18:22.553
Willing.

18:23.770 --> 18:26.978
Yes...

18:27.565 --> 18:30.056
Peace...

18:30.151 --> 18:32.062
This is an abomination.

18:32.153 --> 18:35.691
I'm so filled with
uncharitable rage.

18:38.952 --> 18:42.365
No!

18:43.290 --> 18:45.622
(sobbing)

18:50.297 --> 18:52.879
You weren't going to tell us
that John was leaving
the planet!

18:52.966 --> 18:54.251
It wasn't my idea.

18:54.342 --> 18:56.628
Grab Empress Novia by the
throat if you dare.

18:56.720 --> 18:58.256
When did the Transport Pod
disappear?

18:58.346 --> 19:00.678
Immediately after passing
through our weather layer.

19:00.765 --> 19:03.097
There's been no signal
from it whatsoever.

19:03.184 --> 19:05.311
Oh, did it explode?
-Not that I can tell.

19:05.395 --> 19:07.761
Was it commandeered?
-Could it have landed somewhere?

19:07.856 --> 19:08.891
No!

19:08.982 --> 19:10.563
This is Scorpius,
I'm sure of it.

19:10.650 --> 19:11.890
No, the Scarran.

19:11.985 --> 19:15.148
Hey! You and the Scarran,
not a good idea.

19:15.238 --> 19:17.194
Remember the last time?

19:17.282 --> 19:19.398
Let me try first.

19:19.492 --> 19:22.484
Rygel:
I'll, uh... be with the
Empress.

19:22.579 --> 19:23.819
(grunts)

19:25.248 --> 19:29.366
I'm sorry.
I know the worst is being
left behind.

19:37.135 --> 19:39.968
Is there a reason your ship is
so far from the others?

19:40.055 --> 19:41.795
It's an automated cargo runner.

19:41.890 --> 19:45.348
Isolation makes it harder to
find and discourages looters.

19:45.435 --> 19:48.177
And why would someone want to
loot an empty cargo runner?

19:48.271 --> 19:50.227
Only empty of crew.

19:50.315 --> 19:52.806
It is filled with wedding
presents for the Princess
and yourself.

19:52.901 --> 19:54.516
Presents?
No, no, no, no.

19:54.611 --> 19:56.727
You have done enough. I'm going
to talk to the missus.

19:56.821 --> 19:59.107
You can keep the presents.
You need a toaster, right?

19:59.199 --> 20:01.440
Toaster, toaster, toaster...

20:01.534 --> 20:04.367
Oh, I couldn't, Highness.

20:04.454 --> 20:05.819
It's John.

20:05.914 --> 20:08.530
Look, I'm going to be a
statue for 80 cycles.

20:08.625 --> 20:12.083
Someone ought to use the stuff
while the warranties
are still good.

20:12.170 --> 20:14.252
Our culture frowns on
acquisition.

20:14.339 --> 20:17.206
We live to serve,
not to possess.

20:17.300 --> 20:19.461
So you don't own your
own stuff.

20:19.552 --> 20:22.840
No. To what end does
possessory wealth serve?

20:22.931 --> 20:26.173
Whoa, good question.
Uh...

20:26.267 --> 20:30.806
before I left Earth, I had a
lot of things that were very
important to me.

20:30.897 --> 20:32.478
No more?

20:32.565 --> 20:33.600
(sighs)

20:33.691 --> 20:34.942
I live in a converted cell.

20:35.026 --> 20:40.316
ldon't have a VCR,
no remote control,

20:40.407 --> 20:43.114
damn, no Charlie Parker albums,

20:43.201 --> 20:45.783
and I do miss my '62 T-bird.

20:45.870 --> 20:48.122
T-bie, T-bie, T-bie,
oh... T-bird.

20:48.206 --> 20:50.322
But you discover you need
very little.

20:50.417 --> 20:54.251
Uh, do you miss not having
these things?

20:54.337 --> 20:57.249
Not really. Priorities change.

20:57.340 --> 21:00.207
I often wonder what I
would do with wealth.

21:00.301 --> 21:03.759
Well, I tell you what.
If there's ever anything I
can do to help you find it,

21:03.847 --> 21:05.132
you let me know.

21:05.223 --> 21:07.805
I shall remember those
words, Highness.

21:07.892 --> 21:09.143
It's John.

21:09.227 --> 21:11.969
Yes, Highness, yes.

21:19.362 --> 21:22.479
Poor Katralla.
So unaware of what it takes.

21:22.574 --> 21:24.610
To be a slut, Jenavian?

21:25.285 --> 21:27.367
To keep a man.

21:27.454 --> 21:30.196
I heard yours ran off rather
than marry you.

21:30.290 --> 21:32.281
Somebody tried to kill him.

21:32.375 --> 21:35.333
Probably my brother,
yourﬁancee.

21:35.420 --> 21:37.081
What does that say about you?

21:37.172 --> 21:39.163
Honestly?

21:39.257 --> 21:41.248
That I pick winners.

21:41.342 --> 21:43.469
You disgust me.

21:43.553 --> 21:45.134
Hello, ladies.
-Let go of me!

21:45.221 --> 21:47.086
Hope I'm not disturbing.
-Let go of me.

21:47.182 --> 21:49.924
Now, listen to me closely
so that there's no
misunderstanding.

21:50.018 --> 21:53.351
I don't know what game's being
played on this little planet of
yours, and I don't really care.

21:53.438 --> 21:58.683
What I care about is that a
friend of mine is not hurt, in
any sense of the word.

21:58.776 --> 22:02.519
-How dare you!
And if he is, I will personally
take revenge

22:02.614 --> 22:06.027
on both of your overly
made-up faces.

22:06.117 --> 22:07.448
(sighs)

22:10.413 --> 22:14.747
He came into my chambers and he
affronted me before my fiancee!

22:14.834 --> 22:17.291
I will have his head on a post.

22:17.378 --> 22:20.290
Your Highness, silence!

22:20.381 --> 22:23.919
Your gas attack on Crichton and
the Princess succeeded.

22:24.010 --> 22:26.251
He has fled. You have won.

22:26.346 --> 22:29.133
I assume the gas attack
was yours. I wouldn't
kill my own sister.

22:29.224 --> 22:33.433
Then you are perhaps
unworthy to be Regent.

22:33.520 --> 22:38.059
Nevertheless, this impostor
to the crown is gone.

22:38.149 --> 22:42.188
Your sister's birth-versary
approaches in two solar days.

22:42.278 --> 22:43.814
Am I interrupting?

22:43.905 --> 22:45.111
Hey...

22:45.198 --> 22:47.314
(Chiana chuckles)
well of course I am.

22:47.408 --> 22:53.324
Yeah. Yeah, it's so, so hard
to conduct a conspiracy
without privacy.

22:53.414 --> 22:55.791
Well, ask me. I should know.

22:55.875 --> 22:57.285
What do you want?

22:57.377 --> 23:00.289
I'm a Nebari.
You may have heard of us.

23:00.380 --> 23:04.089
Leave this room now, child.

23:04.175 --> 23:08.293
Well, you also may have heard
how we can defeat full
Command Carriers.

23:08.388 --> 23:11.346
Not to mention, uh...
mind cleansing.

23:11.432 --> 23:15.391
We are both impressed
and daunted.

23:15.478 --> 23:19.346
By all means, Nebari, continue.

23:19.440 --> 23:24.355
So, uh... if anything happens
to John Crichton, expect, uh...

23:24.445 --> 23:25.776
( snarls )

23:25.863 --> 23:27.694
expect retribution.

23:28.408 --> 23:30.023
Yeah.

23:30.785 --> 23:32.241
Retribution.

23:34.414 --> 23:35.574
(whispering ):
Frell.

23:35.665 --> 23:37.781
( snarling )

23:37.875 --> 23:40.582
What the hezmana was
that all about?

23:40.670 --> 23:44.208
They don't know where
he is either.

23:44.841 --> 23:49.335
You are going to rule.

24:00.440 --> 24:01.304
(loud clunk)

24:04.444 --> 24:07.151
(alarms sounds)

24:07.238 --> 24:09.479
Computer:
Invader alert! Invader alert!

24:09.574 --> 24:12.816
20 microts to force
depressurisation.

24:12.910 --> 24:15.367
Occupant lighting mode.

24:15.455 --> 24:17.662
Reduce by half.

24:19.250 --> 24:22.959
Crichton:
Wow, this place has an
interesting smell.

24:23.046 --> 24:25.788
It's not exactly five star
hotel, is it?

24:27.175 --> 24:30.338
But at least it's off
the main road.

24:30.428 --> 24:32.419
( grunts )
-Get down!

24:35.433 --> 24:36.798
Dont

24:38.811 --> 24:42.679
Oh, how disappointing you
are in the flesh.

24:42.774 --> 24:44.310
Oh, I get that all the time.

24:44.400 --> 24:47.312
To think of all the energy
Scorpius expended on you.

24:47.403 --> 24:50.816
Yeah. I'm not crazy
about it either.

24:52.200 --> 24:54.407
Notify Scorpius as instructed.

24:54.494 --> 24:57.577
Sub-pulse shielded frequency.

24:57.664 --> 25:01.202
A little reunion is in order,
don't you think?

25:01.292 --> 25:02.953
Hmm?

25:09.258 --> 25:12.170
I've cut his transport loose.
It's drifting away.

25:12.261 --> 25:15.469
The Marauder that's coming to
pick us up will need to
dock in its place.

25:15.556 --> 25:17.137
Now where's the rest
of my payment?

25:17.225 --> 25:19.341
When Crichton is safely aboard
the Command Carrier.

25:19.435 --> 25:21.391
That wasn't my arrangement
with Scorpius.

25:21.479 --> 25:22.889
I want my payment.

25:22.980 --> 25:24.060
( high-pitched beeping )

25:24.148 --> 25:26.230
Ah, that will be him now.

25:28.111 --> 25:29.942
You do not get the toaster.

25:32.532 --> 25:34.272
So no one knows where we are?

25:34.367 --> 25:37.985
Both yours and this vessel have
radically altered
trans-sequence ident codes

25:38.079 --> 25:41.992
which identify us as
derelict refuelers.

25:42.083 --> 25:43.914
Scorpius (over hologram ):
Inventive.

25:44.293 --> 25:45.544
Evasive.

25:45.628 --> 25:48.085
In custody.

25:48.172 --> 25:49.787
My commendations,
Lieutenant Braca.

25:49.882 --> 25:54.296
See to it that our quarry
remain secure.

25:54.387 --> 25:56.127
I want my payment.

25:57.306 --> 25:59.638
But of course.

25:59.726 --> 26:03.560
Lieutenant, reward our
Jakench friend.

26:03.646 --> 26:07.184
And at the conclusion of the
mission, give her something...

26:07.275 --> 26:09.391
additional from me.

26:09.485 --> 26:11.146
( breathing excitedly )

26:14.282 --> 26:18.275
Your admirable associate,
Ka D'Argo, was just here
to see me.

26:18.369 --> 26:22.954
Of course, since I have no idea
where you are, he left feeling,

26:23.040 --> 26:26.783
well, unfulfilled.

26:26.878 --> 26:29.290
Why don't you leave me
alone, Scorpy?

26:29.380 --> 26:32.292
Because the wormhole technology
locked in your brain makes you,

26:32.383 --> 26:35.625
to my knowledge,
unique in the galaxy.

26:35.720 --> 26:36.584
Unique.

26:36.679 --> 26:40.297
And unique is always valuable.

26:41.267 --> 26:42.848
Yes.

26:42.935 --> 26:44.141
(mumbling):
Unique, unique.

26:44.228 --> 26:45.968
Stop or I will shoot you.

26:46.355 --> 26:47.640
Really?

26:48.691 --> 26:51.774
You promise?
-Sit down.

26:51.861 --> 26:53.351
I said, sit down.

26:53.446 --> 26:54.231
Crichton:
Or what?

26:54.322 --> 26:55.437
You're going to shoot me?

26:55.531 --> 26:57.692
If I have to.
-Do me the favor.

26:57.784 --> 26:59.399
ldon't think so, you know.

26:59.494 --> 27:03.157
I don't think Scorpy is going
to give you your badge of
commendation

27:03.247 --> 27:05.158
if you shoot "Unique."

27:05.249 --> 27:07.911
Sit down, or I'll shoot your
limbs off one at a time.

27:08.002 --> 27:10.744
Uh-uh. No, no, no.
See, Human, Sebacean.

27:10.838 --> 27:12.294
Human, Sebacean.
We're different.

27:12.381 --> 27:14.246
One wound, l bleed out.

27:14.342 --> 27:16.082
( imitating Scorpius ):
Oh, Officer Braca,

27:16.177 --> 27:18.338
what the frell happened, huh?

27:19.388 --> 27:20.252
Hmm, hmm, hmm?

27:20.348 --> 27:22.805
Fine, let's do it then!
Let's do this thing!

27:22.892 --> 27:25.258
Come on, shoot me!
Right here, right here!

27:25.353 --> 27:28.265
Oh, no, no, no, not the brain.
He wants the brain.

27:28.356 --> 27:30.392
The heart, here. The heart.

27:30.483 --> 27:34.351
You shoot me in the heart.
Uh, kind of your...
left, right?

27:34.445 --> 27:35.855
Oh, yeah, my right, your left.

27:35.947 --> 27:37.858
My left, your right.

27:37.949 --> 27:39.234
Here, John Wayne Bobbitt.

27:39.325 --> 27:41.907
Vienna Boys' Choir.
(singing soprano)

27:41.994 --> 27:42.983
You're insane!

27:43.079 --> 27:45.286
My sex life!
Kill my sex life, now!

27:45.373 --> 27:48.206
Quick, shoot! Just shoot me!

27:48.459 --> 27:50.290
Crazy.

27:51.462 --> 27:55.125
Ah, keep back! Get back or
the white boy gets it!

27:55.216 --> 27:57.298
Oh man, don't let him kill me.
Don't let...

27:57.385 --> 27:58.921
You people are so dumb.

27:59.011 --> 28:00.876
Sit down!

28:02.390 --> 28:04.176
What's he done?
-No, no, no!

28:04.267 --> 28:05.757
Coolant pumps cycling,

28:05.852 --> 28:07.058
fuel generation,

28:07.144 --> 28:08.270
generators cabling,

28:08.354 --> 28:10.515
weapons priming!
-Weapons?!

28:11.899 --> 28:13.855
(whimpering)

28:13.943 --> 28:15.808
Shut them down!
Shut the weapons down!

28:15.903 --> 28:18.280
Oh, oh, oh, shut 'em down
yourself, Braca!
Shut 'em down yourself!

28:18.364 --> 28:22.778
Over comms:
Undeclared craft, you have
engaged weaponry in a tactical free zone

28:22.869 --> 28:24.279
surrounding the royal planet.

28:24.370 --> 28:26.406
Excuse me!
Uh, should I get this?

28:26.497 --> 28:28.158
Stay away from the comms!
-Power down your cells

28:28.249 --> 28:31.082
and identify yourself
immediately!
-Stay away from the comms!

28:31.168 --> 28:32.874
I said get Crichton!

28:32.962 --> 28:35.078
Undeclared craft.

28:35.172 --> 28:38.005
You are in a tactical
free zone.

28:38.092 --> 28:40.299
Identify yourselves
immediately.

28:40.386 --> 28:42.923
We're so screwed, man!

28:43.014 --> 28:45.096
We're going to die!

28:59.614 --> 29:01.650
Shut down now!

29:01.741 --> 29:04.278
Whoo, whoo, whoo!

29:04.368 --> 29:06.575
Look what you've done!

29:07.914 --> 29:09.825
( screaming )

29:09.916 --> 29:11.326
(grunting and yelling)

29:12.376 --> 29:13.240
Oh!

29:13.336 --> 29:15.952
Braca:
Oh, frell!

29:16.047 --> 29:17.878
Crichton:
Ho, ho, ho!

29:22.011 --> 29:23.967
( screaming )

29:36.317 --> 29:38.228
You're insane.

29:38.319 --> 29:40.480
What? You just figured that
out? I thought that was
common knowledge.

29:40.571 --> 29:43.358
We have got to get
out of here now!

29:43.449 --> 29:44.609
Oh, really?

29:44.700 --> 29:46.952
All right, then!

29:47.870 --> 29:49.326
Do you want us both to die?

29:49.413 --> 29:51.790
You didn't think I was going
to go alone, did ya?

29:55.586 --> 29:58.669
Bye, Crichton! The ship's yours!
But I've got the helmet!

29:58.756 --> 30:00.337
(Crichton yelling):
Oh, frell,

30:00.424 --> 30:04.212
frell, frell, frell, frell,
frell, frell!

30:05.596 --> 30:07.712
(yelling)

30:18.526 --> 30:20.938
This is John Crichton.
I'm in the ship that...

30:21.028 --> 30:22.768
This is John Crichton...

30:29.120 --> 30:30.781
Scorpius:
Focus,John.

30:30.871 --> 30:33.283
Panic is unacceptable.
You will survive.

30:33.374 --> 30:34.614
No.

30:34.709 --> 30:36.324
You must survive.

30:36.419 --> 30:37.283
No!

30:37.378 --> 30:39.414
You've come too far to die.

31:11.412 --> 31:13.949
Never get off the boat.

31:14.040 --> 31:16.747
Never get off the boat, man!

31:24.633 --> 31:25.918
(fires gun)

31:27.344 --> 31:28.424
( fires )

31:28.512 --> 31:30.844
(Crichton's heart pounding )

31:33.809 --> 31:35.390
(fires gun)

32:12.640 --> 32:15.347
(air decompressing )

32:22.900 --> 32:26.188
(coughing)

32:26.278 --> 32:29.270
(yelling)

32:31.325 --> 32:34.032
Kahaynu, present yourself!

32:37.790 --> 32:39.405
Kahaynu!

32:39.500 --> 32:42.412
I will speak with you now.

32:45.506 --> 32:51.342
The spirit of the warrior
resides in your priestliness.

32:51.428 --> 32:55.012
The spirit of an executioner
within yours.

32:55.099 --> 32:58.091
Pointless recriminations.

32:58.185 --> 33:00.016
Is there anything else
you wish?

33:00.104 --> 33:04.063
As a symbiotic part of Moya,
Pilot is trapped.

33:04.150 --> 33:06.311
Build him a new ship so he...

33:06.402 --> 33:08.188
he does not perish needlessly.

33:08.279 --> 33:11.567
We are not prepared to do
more than we have.

33:11.657 --> 33:14.694
I should say goodbye before
it is too late.

33:14.785 --> 33:16.696
This is wrong.

33:16.787 --> 33:18.652
I will not allow this!

33:35.973 --> 33:39.215
I've, uh, spoken to the
Empress, John.

33:42.271 --> 33:44.307
She's not going to do anything.

33:44.398 --> 33:48.516
Three near-death experiences
in a day and she's going
to do nothing.

33:48.611 --> 33:53.071
The Empress has put Scorpius
on notice, the Scarran too,
her son. Everyone.

33:53.157 --> 33:58.902
Security's so tight, that last
night they burst into my room
just as Chiana was, um...

33:58.996 --> 34:00.702
screaming.

34:00.789 --> 34:02.450
I'm tired of this.

34:04.418 --> 34:07.160
It's all politics, John.

34:07.254 --> 34:11.338
As in neutral, powerful
kingdom, they expel someone
during coronation

34:11.425 --> 34:15.168
it will have negative
consequences which will
ripple outwards.

34:15.262 --> 34:19.175
You know, you're starting to
sound like an old history
professor.

34:19.266 --> 34:24.511
Rygel's been very excellent
at teaching me.

34:25.898 --> 34:28.264
So, nothing has changed.

34:29.318 --> 34:30.228
Options?

34:31.737 --> 34:33.238
Okay.

34:33.322 --> 34:35.654
You could run as you
did before.

34:36.575 --> 34:40.033
Or you could submit
and stay here.

34:40.120 --> 34:43.704
Either way, I'll back
whatever you do.

35:05.020 --> 35:07.557
I'm very proud of you.

35:07.648 --> 35:08.888
Really.

35:08.983 --> 35:10.393
Yes.

35:11.402 --> 35:12.812
Why?

35:14.363 --> 35:16.024
Being Crichton.

35:16.115 --> 35:18.026
The Crichton | always knew.

35:18.117 --> 35:19.903
Yeah?
-Mmmm...

35:19.994 --> 35:22.906
Getting my ass kicked all
over the universe.

35:24.290 --> 35:27.202
Putting yourself into a position
to get your ass kicked.

35:27.293 --> 35:30.330
Fighting, resisting.

35:30.421 --> 35:32.161
Never giving up.

35:33.299 --> 35:36.086
Aeryn, is there a way
off this planet?

35:37.428 --> 35:41.797
Have you convinced Scorpius
to stop chasing me?

35:41.890 --> 35:46.850
The Empress, is she no longer
intent on her daughter being
heir to the throne?

35:46.937 --> 35:49.314
Those are not good reasons
for getting married.

35:49.398 --> 35:51.309
I know. Bigger picture.

35:53.360 --> 35:59.151
Let's say that the idiot son
inherits the throne.

35:59.241 --> 36:01.277
He starts wars.
He makes bad alliances.

36:01.368 --> 36:03.825
Millions of people die.

36:06.498 --> 36:08.784
80 cycles.

36:10.294 --> 36:11.579
It's not that long of a time.

36:11.670 --> 36:14.377
Oh, so you've rationalized
this all out, have you?

36:16.050 --> 36:18.291
Aeryn, I'm tired.

36:20.429 --> 36:22.215
What am I supposed to do?

36:22.306 --> 36:24.672
What am I supposed to do
when there's no fight left?

36:24.767 --> 36:26.553
You run away.

36:31.398 --> 36:33.263
With you?

36:36.362 --> 36:38.523
With all of us together.

36:55.798 --> 36:56.662
What?

36:56.757 --> 36:59.294
You can't just quit.

36:59.385 --> 37:00.670
I'm not quitting.

37:01.637 --> 37:03.923
Ijust can't go on.

37:04.723 --> 37:06.224
Was I wrong?

37:07.226 --> 37:09.387
You're no longer the
Crichton I knew?

37:21.323 --> 37:24.440
I'm exploring the Barren Lands.

37:24.535 --> 37:27.322
If you think you can keep up...

38:10.247 --> 38:15.287
Moya has slipped from
my consciousness.

38:15.377 --> 38:21.623
She is gone and I am
shortly to follow.

38:25.179 --> 38:26.385
(sighs)

38:26.472 --> 38:29.009
Don't feel sad.

38:29.099 --> 38:31.806
Our lives were good.

38:31.894 --> 38:33.555
Moya is right.

38:33.645 --> 38:36.933
We are fulfilled.

38:39.318 --> 38:40.899
Pilot...

38:43.322 --> 38:45.688
it has been a pleasure.

38:46.825 --> 38:50.943
I... am... ready now.

38:52.122 --> 38:56.411
I have seen the stars.

39:12.100 --> 39:13.260
Hey, bro.

39:16.480 --> 39:18.687
Glad to see you could make it.

39:26.657 --> 39:28.648
Much fortune.

39:36.124 --> 39:37.989
You're making a, uh...

39:39.002 --> 39:40.617
mistake, Crichton.

39:40.712 --> 39:43.328
Oh, I don't think so, Scorpy.

39:43.423 --> 39:46.915
I had one request for
a wedding present.

39:47.010 --> 39:49.968
That you be banned from
this planet forever.

39:50.055 --> 39:51.044
( sniffs )

39:51.139 --> 39:52.970
Do you know what they said?

39:55.185 --> 39:56.891
Yes, Your Highness.

39:57.521 --> 39:59.307
Oh.

40:03.193 --> 40:06.276
(slow, dramatic music plays)

40:22.838 --> 40:24.829
Not you.

40:27.384 --> 40:29.875
In the presence of the spirit,

40:29.970 --> 40:36.887
of all who have sacrificed
so that we may rule
ourselves in peace.

40:38.395 --> 40:43.640
I call public the joining of
my daughter and her betrothed

40:43.734 --> 40:53.234
in the sacred ceremony that
shall ensure compassionate
governance and harmony.

40:55.037 --> 41:00.532
Should anyone among you feel
cause to sway the will of love,

41:00.626 --> 41:08.795
to question the ability,
the sincerity or the destiny
of this union,

41:10.302 --> 41:13.260
rise now and be heard.

41:26.526 --> 41:29.518
With your silence as
benediction,

41:29.613 --> 41:32.776
I invite you to now rise

41:32.866 --> 41:41.240
and witness the crux of
power pass from one generation
to the next.

41:43.251 --> 41:45.378
You will now be wed.

41:58.392 --> 42:01.008
It is more obligation
than honor.

42:01.103 --> 42:06.598
You are not only responsible
for each other, but for the
lives of your subjects.

42:06.692 --> 42:09.525
Do you accept this burden
in matrimony?

42:09.611 --> 42:11.647
Without hesitation.

42:12.572 --> 42:14.608
Without hesitation.

42:15.450 --> 42:17.532
As reigning monarch,

42:17.619 --> 42:23.706
it gives me great pleasure to
formally introduce our
successors,

42:23.792 --> 42:32.416
the future Empress and Regent
of this great and peaceful
civilization.

42:32.509 --> 42:34.795
Katralla and John.

42:34.886 --> 42:37.423
( applause )

42:37.514 --> 42:41.678
Magnificent.
I smell power again.

42:45.147 --> 42:49.390
Pieces of different kindling
often build the strongest fire.

42:51.445 --> 42:52.685
Thank you.

42:55.240 --> 42:56.776
Hey, you were great.

42:56.867 --> 42:58.323
Where was she, D'Argo?

42:58.410 --> 43:01.322
You must forget about
Aeryn, John.

43:01.413 --> 43:02.698
Thank you.

43:02.789 --> 43:09.206
I, uh, recorded some messages,
um, Zhaan, Pilot and Aeryn.

43:09.296 --> 43:11.878
Yeah, I'll make sure
they get them.

43:11.965 --> 43:12.590
Thanks.

43:12.674 --> 43:15.211
Hey, I love you.
-I know.

43:15.302 --> 43:17.258
All right, all right, enough
with the kissing and cuddling.

43:17.345 --> 43:18.846
John.

43:18.930 --> 43:23.924
I will stand beside you for 80
cycles with love in my heart,

43:24.019 --> 43:26.260
and long for the day when
we may revive.

43:26.354 --> 43:28.265
( beeps )

43:42.788 --> 43:44.198
( applause )

43:44.289 --> 43:46.029
Whoa.

43:46.124 --> 43:47.409
Whoa.

43:50.837 --> 43:53.874
It's calibrated only
for Sebaceans.

43:53.965 --> 43:57.799
Endure the pain,
and rule wisely.

44:01.389 --> 44:03.675
The time has come for
farewells, my friend.

44:03.767 --> 44:05.223
Oh, this is not happening.

44:05.310 --> 44:08.802
Just feel free to wake me
up anytime, D'Argo.

44:08.897 --> 44:11.183
Well, now I can only
speak truth.

44:11.274 --> 44:14.437
And that comes as good
and bad news.

44:14.528 --> 44:17.270
All right, give me the
bad news first.

44:17.364 --> 44:19.605
The bad news is that
you're married,

44:19.699 --> 44:24.113
and you must endure as a
statue for 80 cycles
in a strange world.

44:24.830 --> 44:26.320
What's the good news?

44:26.414 --> 44:29.827
Chiana and l are having
fantastic sex.

44:32.629 --> 44:35.086
( laughs )

44:35.173 --> 44:36.288
( beeps )

44:39.344 --> 44:41.676
( screams )

44:44.766 --> 44:47.098
( applause )
