WEBVTT

00:07.006 --> 00:09.343
(grunting)

00:20.754 --> 00:22.190
Got you.
(groans)

00:22.222 --> 00:23.657
Right in the heart.

00:23.690 --> 00:25.859
Satisfied?

00:25.893 --> 00:28.528
I'm not sure that's the word.

00:30.698 --> 00:31.931
Okay.

00:31.964 --> 00:33.667
I didn't mean
satisfied like--

00:33.701 --> 00:35.536
No, I--

00:35.569 --> 00:37.003
I wasn't trying to--

00:37.036 --> 00:38.371
'Cause we're not
having satisfaction

00:38.405 --> 00:41.040
in the personal
sense.

00:41.075 --> 00:42.710
Of course.

00:42.743 --> 00:45.012
I should go.
Giles is--

00:45.045 --> 00:46.847
Is waiting for you.

00:46.880 --> 00:47.914
I know.

00:47.948 --> 00:49.750
Thanks.
For the workout.

00:49.783 --> 00:53.186
Hey, um, am I gonna
see you this weekend?

00:53.220 --> 00:55.923
You, uh, you-you, you
probably have plans.

00:55.956 --> 00:57.557
Right, birthday.

00:57.591 --> 01:00.561
Um... actually,
I-I do have a thing.

01:00.594 --> 01:02.195
Oh, "a thing."

01:02.229 --> 01:03.530
A date?

01:03.564 --> 01:06.534
Nice attempt at casual.

01:06.567 --> 01:08.902
Actually,
I do have a date.

01:08.936 --> 01:10.237
Older man.

01:10.271 --> 01:11.938
Very handsome.

01:11.971 --> 01:13.373
Likes it when I call him Daddy.

01:13.406 --> 01:15.909
(chuckles)
Your father.

01:15.942 --> 01:17.545
It is your father, right?

01:17.578 --> 01:18.611
(quiet laugh)

01:18.646 --> 01:19.879
He's taking me to the ice show.

01:19.912 --> 01:21.948
Which should be
big fun.

01:21.981 --> 01:25.552
I could use a little fun.

01:25.585 --> 01:27.987
GILES:
This one?

01:28.021 --> 01:29.390
Amethyst.

01:29.423 --> 01:31.125
Used for?

01:31.158 --> 01:32.960
Breath mints?

01:32.992 --> 01:35.429
Charm bags, money spells,

01:35.462 --> 01:37.997
and for cleansing
one's aura.

01:38.031 --> 01:40.567
Okay, so how do you know
if one's aura's dirty?

01:40.600 --> 01:42.302
Somebody come by
with a finger and write

01:42.335 --> 01:43.503
"Wash me" on it?

01:43.537 --> 01:45.139
Buffy, I'm aware
of your distaste

01:45.173 --> 01:46.807
at studying
vibratory stones,

01:46.840 --> 01:48.676
but since it is
part of your training,

01:48.709 --> 01:49.977
I would appreciate

01:50.009 --> 01:52.246
your glib-free attention.

01:52.280 --> 01:54.182
Sorry.
It's just with Faith

01:54.215 --> 01:55.948
on one of her
unannounced walkabouts,

01:55.983 --> 01:58.319
I feel like somebody
should be patrolling.

01:58.352 --> 01:59.920
Well, Faith is not interested
in proper training,

01:59.953 --> 02:01.254
so I must rely on you
to keep up with yours.

02:01.289 --> 02:02.623
I hate being the good one.

02:02.656 --> 02:03.924
And as for patrolling,

02:03.956 --> 02:06.493
well, you'll be there
soon enough.

02:06.527 --> 02:07.628
Why so anxious?

02:07.661 --> 02:09.697
I guess it...

02:09.729 --> 02:11.764
I just have some...

02:11.799 --> 02:14.134
energy to burn.

02:14.168 --> 02:17.204
Well, in due time,
but, uh, for the present,

02:17.237 --> 02:20.774
if it's not entirely
beyond your capabilities...

02:20.807 --> 02:23.143
try to concentrate.

02:25.545 --> 02:27.414
(sighs)

02:30.016 --> 02:31.784
(grunting)

02:31.818 --> 02:33.853
Wow, that was
really funny-looking.

02:33.887 --> 02:35.055
Could you do it again?

02:35.087 --> 02:36.324
I'll kill you for that.

02:36.356 --> 02:38.292
For that?
What were you trying

02:38.325 --> 02:40.360
to kill me for before?

02:42.996 --> 02:44.997
Okay, so here's the deal--

02:45.031 --> 02:46.266
(deep breath)

02:46.933 --> 02:48.701
(grunts)

02:55.675 --> 02:57.277
No!

02:58.679 --> 02:59.780
(shrieks)

03:03.015 --> 03:04.551
Let me know if I'm not
doing this right.

03:09.188 --> 03:12.259
(wolf howling)

03:12.293 --> 03:14.395
*

04:02.610 --> 04:05.479
(Buffy huffing)

04:09.349 --> 04:11.784
(grunting)

04:31.305 --> 04:33.507
(indistinct chatter)

04:35.808 --> 04:38.077
Bit early in the day.

04:38.110 --> 04:40.814
Giles,
something's wrong.

04:40.848 --> 04:43.651
Wrong?

04:43.683 --> 04:45.252
Ah.

04:45.284 --> 04:47.454
Perhaps you shouldn't...

04:49.221 --> 04:50.423
...do that anymore.

04:50.457 --> 04:51.692
On top of that,
I got a bad case

04:51.725 --> 04:52.826
of the dizzies last night,

04:52.860 --> 04:54.362
and almost let
a vamp stake me.

04:54.394 --> 04:57.564
With my own stake!

04:58.865 --> 05:01.033
I'm way off my game.

05:01.067 --> 05:02.603
My game's left the country.

05:02.636 --> 05:04.137
It's in Cuernavaca.

05:04.170 --> 05:06.339
Giles, what's going on here?

05:06.374 --> 05:09.843
Well, perhaps you've got
a bad flu bug or something.

05:09.877 --> 05:11.478
No. No, not sick.

05:11.512 --> 05:13.646
I can't get sick.

05:13.680 --> 05:15.783
My dad's coming to take me
to the ice show.

05:15.815 --> 05:18.552
We do it every year
for my birthday.

05:18.586 --> 05:20.387
If I cancel,
it's gonna break his heart.

05:20.420 --> 05:23.290
Well, just, uh,
take it easy for 48 hours.

05:23.322 --> 05:27.226
You know, forego patrolling
until you feel yourself again.

05:27.259 --> 05:29.629
No.
No, I ju--

05:29.663 --> 05:31.665
I just need to spend
a little more time training.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.701
(crashes)

05:34.735 --> 05:35.802
I'm gone.

05:35.836 --> 05:36.970
Thank you.

05:37.004 --> 05:38.071
XANDER:
 An ice show?

05:38.105 --> 05:41.173
A show performed on ice.

05:41.207 --> 05:42.709
And how old are we again?

05:42.742 --> 05:44.512
I went to Snoopy on Ice
when I was little.

05:44.545 --> 05:47.346
My dad took me backstage,
and I got so scared

05:47.380 --> 05:49.316
I threw up on Woodstock.

05:49.348 --> 05:51.685
BUFFY: Look, I know you guys
think it's just a big, dumb,

05:51.718 --> 05:53.387
girlie thing,
but it's not-- I mean,

05:53.420 --> 05:55.021
a lot of those skaters
are Olympic medal winners.

05:55.055 --> 05:57.324
And every year my dad buys me
cotton candy and one

05:57.356 --> 05:59.826
of those souvenir programs
that has all the pictures--

05:59.860 --> 06:03.362
And okay, it's a big, dumb,
girlie thing, but I love it.

06:03.396 --> 06:04.598
It's not so girlie.

06:04.632 --> 06:05.865
Ice is cool.

06:05.899 --> 06:07.935
It's water,
but it's not.

06:07.968 --> 06:11.404
I think it's sweet you
and your dad have a tradition.

06:11.439 --> 06:13.339
Especially now that
he's not around so much.

06:13.372 --> 06:15.408
Ixnay on the caramel corn,

06:15.442 --> 06:17.209
though, if you go backstage.

06:17.244 --> 06:18.946
We're still
talking party, right?

06:18.978 --> 06:21.213
I mean, some of us still love
to relish celebrating

06:21.247 --> 06:23.016
in the birth of the Buff.

06:23.050 --> 06:24.584
I don't know.
I think it might be

06:24.617 --> 06:26.853
time to put a moratorium
on parties in my honor.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.221
They tend to go badly.

06:28.254 --> 06:30.089
Monsters crash.
People die.

06:30.122 --> 06:32.391
But 18 is a big one, Buffy.

06:32.425 --> 06:34.461
I mean, you can vote now.

06:34.495 --> 06:36.262
You can be drafted.

06:36.295 --> 06:38.264
You can vote not to be drafted.

06:38.298 --> 06:40.132
I think I'll choose to celebrate

06:40.167 --> 06:42.069
this one with quiet reflection.

06:42.101 --> 06:43.571
XANDER:
Where's it written

06:43.603 --> 06:44.971
that quiet reflection
can't be combined

06:45.004 --> 06:47.007
with cake and funny hats?

06:53.514 --> 06:55.582
(door opens, closes)

06:55.615 --> 06:57.651
Buffy?

06:57.685 --> 06:58.752
Present.

06:58.786 --> 07:00.588
Ooh, present.

07:00.620 --> 07:01.754
Uh, they're not.

07:01.788 --> 07:02.956
They're from your father.

07:02.990 --> 07:05.125
His, uh...

07:05.158 --> 07:07.127
quarterly projections
are unraveling,

07:07.160 --> 07:09.129
and he can't afford
to take off right now.

07:09.161 --> 07:11.130
He promises
to make it up to you.

07:11.163 --> 07:13.100
It's all right there
in the letter.

07:15.101 --> 07:17.269
If-if you want,
I could ask somebody

07:17.303 --> 07:19.305
to cover for me
at the gallery.

07:19.338 --> 07:21.641
I mean, if you want
me to take you.

07:21.675 --> 07:22.742
No.

07:22.776 --> 07:24.612
No, it's not necessary.

07:24.644 --> 07:26.680
I was just thinking
it might be nice

07:26.713 --> 07:29.115
to have a-a quiet birthday.

07:43.963 --> 07:45.999
*

07:57.978 --> 08:00.146
How much longer, Hobson?

08:00.180 --> 08:03.449
Five, maybe
six hours, sir.

08:03.483 --> 08:06.786
Once you finish, you
and Blair can get some rest.

08:06.819 --> 08:09.088
But sleep in shifts.

08:16.596 --> 08:20.500
We're getting very close.

08:20.533 --> 08:24.672
The slayer's preparation
is nearly complete.

08:24.704 --> 08:27.339
BUFFY: You know, it's not
just cartoon characters.

08:27.374 --> 08:31.478
They do pieces from
operas and ballets.

08:31.511 --> 08:35.849
Brian Boitano doing Carmen
is a life changer.

08:35.883 --> 08:38.018
Oh, he doesn't
actually play Carmen,

08:38.051 --> 08:41.321
but a lot of
sophisticated people go.

08:41.354 --> 08:44.157
Yes.
I think we should start

08:44.191 --> 08:46.225
with the grounding
crystal again.

08:46.259 --> 08:47.561
You know, it's
usually something

08:47.595 --> 08:49.763
that families do together.

08:49.797 --> 08:52.365
Now, look very carefully
for the tiny flaw at its core.

08:52.399 --> 08:54.533
If someone were free,

08:54.567 --> 08:56.102
they'd take
their daughters

08:56.135 --> 08:58.538
or their student...

08:58.572 --> 09:00.440
or their slayer.

09:00.472 --> 09:03.409
Hmm? Yes, but, Buffy,
I think we should

09:03.442 --> 09:05.745
concentrate now.
Now, look for the flaw

09:05.778 --> 09:07.648
at its center.

09:24.597 --> 09:26.099
Buffy?

09:51.825 --> 09:54.094
*

10:22.621 --> 10:23.990
Oh, sorry.

10:24.024 --> 10:25.591
Did I zone
out on you?

10:25.625 --> 10:28.128
I'm just...
I'm nursing that flu bug.

10:28.161 --> 10:29.596
It's best to take care of that.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.097
Perhaps we should, um--

10:31.130 --> 10:32.665
Call it a night.

10:32.700 --> 10:34.134
Yeah.

10:34.167 --> 10:35.601
That's a good idea.

10:35.634 --> 10:37.636
Thanks.

10:42.809 --> 10:44.711
Good night.

10:51.985 --> 10:53.352
(indistinct chatter)

10:53.385 --> 10:54.988
So, how's it going
with Amy the Rat?

10:55.022 --> 10:57.557
Good! She loves her
new exercise wheel.

10:57.590 --> 10:58.692
She runs around,
her nose wiggles--

10:58.725 --> 11:00.027
I-I meant, how's it going

11:00.059 --> 11:01.828
changing her back
into a human being?

11:01.861 --> 11:03.897
Oh, still working on it.

11:03.931 --> 11:06.533
But I just got her the cutest
little bell, it's just--

11:06.566 --> 11:08.000
BOY: You don't
do that to me!

11:08.034 --> 11:10.302
I waited for you
at The Bronze all night!

11:10.336 --> 11:11.971
CORDELIA:
And the big deal is?

11:12.004 --> 11:13.240
You made me look
like some kind of dork

11:13.273 --> 11:14.374
in front of my posse.

11:14.407 --> 11:17.210
First of all... posse?

11:17.244 --> 11:18.879
Passé.

11:18.912 --> 11:21.581
Second of all, anyone
with a teaspoon of brains

11:21.614 --> 11:23.350
knows not to take
my flirting seriously.

11:23.383 --> 11:26.552
Especially with my
extenuating circumstances.

11:26.586 --> 11:28.388
Oh, what circumstances?

11:28.421 --> 11:29.923
Rebound!
Look it up.

11:29.956 --> 11:31.024
Hey!

11:31.057 --> 11:32.491
I'm not through here.

11:32.524 --> 11:34.326
Oh, I beg to differ.
(grunts)

11:34.360 --> 11:35.562
(scoffs)

11:37.230 --> 11:38.530
What is wrong with you?

11:38.565 --> 11:40.366
Ow.
Ow!

11:40.399 --> 11:42.735
The chick started it.

11:42.769 --> 11:45.205
Are you okay?

11:51.812 --> 11:54.181
Okay, I just got swatted
down by some no-neck

11:54.213 --> 11:56.182
and rescued by Cordelia.

11:56.216 --> 11:57.716
What the hell is happening?

11:57.750 --> 11:59.186
I'm sure it'll
sort itself out.

11:59.219 --> 12:01.187
Look, you're not getting
the big picture here.

12:01.221 --> 12:03.590
I have no strength.

12:03.623 --> 12:06.592
I have no coordination.

12:06.625 --> 12:08.561
I throw knives like...

12:08.595 --> 12:10.062
A girl?

12:11.630 --> 12:13.767
Like I'm not the slayer.

12:13.801 --> 12:17.303
Look, Buffy,
I-I-I assure you...

12:17.336 --> 12:18.971
um, given time...

12:19.005 --> 12:20.740
we'll-we'll get to the bottom

12:20.774 --> 12:23.210
of-of whatever's
causing this, um, anomaly.

12:23.243 --> 12:25.111
Promise me.

12:25.144 --> 12:26.479
Yes.

12:26.513 --> 12:28.648
I give you my word.

12:30.783 --> 12:32.719
MAN:
 You're having doubts.

12:32.751 --> 12:36.722
Cruciamentum is not easy
for slayer or watcher.

12:36.755 --> 12:39.826
But it's been done this way
for a dozen centuries

12:39.860 --> 12:42.062
Whenever a slayer turns 18.

12:42.095 --> 12:43.730
It's a time-honored
rite of passage.

12:43.763 --> 12:47.100
It's an archaic
exercise in cruelty.

12:48.534 --> 12:52.338
To lock her
in this tomb...

12:52.371 --> 12:55.741
weakened,
defenseless.

12:55.774 --> 12:57.543
To unleash that on her.

13:02.182 --> 13:03.450
If any one

13:03.482 --> 13:05.451
of the Council
still had actual contact

13:05.485 --> 13:06.854
with a slayer,
they would see,

13:06.886 --> 13:08.587
but I'm the one
in the thick of it.

13:08.620 --> 13:10.123
Which is why you're not
qualified to make this decision.

13:10.157 --> 13:11.291
You're too close.

13:11.323 --> 13:12.759
That's not true.

13:12.792 --> 13:15.628
A slayer's not just
physical prowess.

13:15.662 --> 13:18.697
She must have cunning,
imagination,

13:18.730 --> 13:22.668
a confidence derived
from self-reliance.

13:22.701 --> 13:24.471
And believe me,
once this is all over,

13:24.504 --> 13:26.538
your Buffy will be
stronger for it.

13:26.572 --> 13:29.076
Or she'll be dead for it.

13:39.519 --> 13:41.488
Rupert.

13:41.520 --> 13:43.890
If this girl is
everything you say,

13:43.923 --> 13:46.158
then you've nothing
to worry about.

13:50.397 --> 13:53.033
Uh, sir, if you can
spare me for a short spell,

13:53.066 --> 13:54.801
I'll need to make a run
to the hardware store.

13:54.834 --> 13:57.370
I just need some--
(man screaming)

13:57.403 --> 14:00.173
Take care of it.

14:01.707 --> 14:03.710
(sighs)

14:07.014 --> 14:08.681
(man grunting)

14:10.716 --> 14:12.184
(growling)

14:19.759 --> 14:21.793
Come on.
Come on.

14:32.705 --> 14:35.542
Kralik, your pills.

14:35.575 --> 14:36.875
Open your mouth.

14:57.764 --> 14:58.932
That's enough.

14:58.966 --> 15:00.667
Close it up.

15:06.773 --> 15:09.341
Ah-ha!
A curse on slayers.

15:10.909 --> 15:13.779
Oh, no, wait.
It-it's lawyers.

15:13.812 --> 15:15.615
XANDER:
You know, maybe
we're on the wrong

15:15.648 --> 15:18.717
track with the whole spell,
curse, and whammy thing.

15:18.750 --> 15:20.820
Maybe what we should be
looking for is something like,

15:20.852 --> 15:22.956
um... Slayer Kryptonite.

15:22.990 --> 15:25.758
Faulty metaphor.
Kryptonite kills.

15:25.792 --> 15:27.927
You're assuming I meant
the green Kryptonite.

15:27.961 --> 15:29.928
I was referring, of course,
to the red Kryptonite,

15:29.962 --> 15:31.331
which drains Superman
of his powers.

15:31.364 --> 15:32.932
Wrong.

15:32.966 --> 15:34.500
The gold Kryptonite's
the power-sucker.

15:34.533 --> 15:37.070
The red Kryptonite mutates
Superman into some sort

15:37.104 --> 15:38.904
of weird--
Guys.

15:38.937 --> 15:41.607
Reality.

15:42.709 --> 15:44.076
Buffy.

15:44.110 --> 15:47.080
I know you are definitely,
without a doubt,

15:47.114 --> 15:48.914
gonna get your powers back.

15:48.947 --> 15:51.018
Thanks, Will.

15:51.051 --> 15:52.585
But what if you don't?

15:52.619 --> 15:54.988
Okay.

15:57.356 --> 15:59.125
If I don't get my powers back,

15:59.158 --> 16:00.994
then I don't.

16:01.028 --> 16:03.830
I'll deal.

16:03.863 --> 16:05.965
And there's a whole lot
of good sides to it.

16:05.999 --> 16:08.500
Actually, this could
open up so many--

16:10.470 --> 16:11.770
Did you find anything?

16:11.803 --> 16:13.806
Uh, no.
Not yet.

16:27.053 --> 16:29.489
(Kralik screaming, banging)

16:32.024 --> 16:34.193
It's your shift.

16:45.105 --> 16:46.338
Pills.

16:46.373 --> 16:48.508
Yes.

16:58.184 --> 16:59.619
(screams)

17:03.255 --> 17:05.424
It's coming!

17:05.458 --> 17:07.460
(groaning)

17:14.101 --> 17:15.233
Pills!

17:19.939 --> 17:21.807
(groaning)

17:24.911 --> 17:26.512
Take them.

17:26.546 --> 17:27.680
Pills!

17:27.713 --> 17:29.015
They're right in front of you.

17:29.048 --> 17:30.583
Where?

17:30.616 --> 17:31.617
Here.

17:31.651 --> 17:32.684
I can't see.

17:32.719 --> 17:35.788
Can't... can't reach it.

17:40.259 --> 17:42.694
Open your eyes.

17:42.729 --> 17:44.163
(grunting)

17:46.665 --> 17:48.701
(choking)

17:48.734 --> 17:50.603
Shh.

17:50.636 --> 17:53.072
Everything's okay now.

18:13.792 --> 18:15.060
Thank you.

18:15.094 --> 18:16.796
It's beautiful.

18:16.828 --> 18:18.298
You really like it?

18:18.330 --> 18:21.268
Of course I do.

18:21.300 --> 18:24.903
It's sweet
and thoughtful and...

18:24.936 --> 18:28.141
Full of neat words
to learn and say

18:28.174 --> 18:31.411
like "wilt" and "henceforth."

18:31.443 --> 18:33.279
Then why did you seem
more excited last year

18:33.313 --> 18:35.548
when you got
a severed arm in a box?

18:37.349 --> 18:39.085
I'm sorry.

18:39.117 --> 18:41.188
Uh, it's just suddenly

18:41.221 --> 18:43.756
there's this chance that
my calling's a wrong number,

18:43.789 --> 18:46.092
and... it's just

18:46.125 --> 18:47.660
freaking me out a little.

18:47.693 --> 18:49.961
That's understandable.

18:49.996 --> 18:51.798
Angel, what if I have
lost my power?

18:51.830 --> 18:53.833
You lived a long time
without it.

18:53.865 --> 18:55.602
You can do it again.

18:55.634 --> 18:57.369
I guess.

18:58.471 --> 19:00.539
But what if I can't?

19:00.573 --> 19:02.008
I've seen too much.

19:02.040 --> 19:05.144
I know what goes bump
in the night.

19:05.178 --> 19:07.046
Not being able
to fight it--

19:07.078 --> 19:08.980
What if I just
hide under my bed,

19:09.015 --> 19:10.682
all scared
and helpless?

19:10.717 --> 19:12.384
Or what if
I just become pathetic?

19:12.419 --> 19:14.053
Hanging out at
the old slayer's home,

19:14.086 --> 19:17.056
talking people's ears off
about my glory days,

19:17.088 --> 19:19.358
showing them Mr. Pointy,
the stake I had bronzed.

19:19.392 --> 19:20.859
Buffy.

19:20.893 --> 19:22.694
You could never be
helpless or boring,

19:22.729 --> 19:24.730
not even if you tried.

19:25.932 --> 19:28.268
Don't be so sure.

19:31.002 --> 19:34.906
Before I was
the slayer, I was...

19:34.941 --> 19:38.644
well, I... I don't want
to say shallow, but...

19:38.677 --> 19:40.880
let's say a certain person,

19:40.913 --> 19:42.181
who will remain nameless,

19:42.214 --> 19:44.182
we'll just call her Spordelia,

19:44.217 --> 19:46.586
looked like a classical
philosopher next to me.

19:47.886 --> 19:49.556
Angel,

19:49.588 --> 19:51.657
if I'm not the slayer...

19:51.691 --> 19:53.058
what do I do?

19:53.092 --> 19:55.394
What do I have to offer?

19:55.427 --> 19:58.265
Why would you like me?

19:58.298 --> 20:01.968
I saw you before
you became the slayer.

20:04.069 --> 20:05.171
What?

20:05.203 --> 20:06.772
I watched you.

20:06.806 --> 20:09.608
And I saw you called.

20:09.642 --> 20:12.077
It was a bright afternoon

20:12.111 --> 20:14.413
out in front of your school.

20:14.446 --> 20:17.384
You walked down the steps,

20:17.416 --> 20:19.419
and, uh,

20:19.451 --> 20:22.020
and I loved you.

20:22.054 --> 20:23.923
Why?

20:23.955 --> 20:27.660
'Cause I could see your heart.

20:32.131 --> 20:34.634
You held it before you
for everyone to see.

20:34.666 --> 20:37.936
And I worried that
it would be bruised or torn.

20:37.970 --> 20:40.373
And more than
anything in my life,

20:40.406 --> 20:43.776
I wanted to keep it safe.

20:43.809 --> 20:46.746
To warm it with my own.

20:52.618 --> 20:54.586
That's beautiful.

20:57.589 --> 21:00.759
Or taken literally,
incredibly gross.

21:00.792 --> 21:03.162
I was just thinking that, too.

21:05.964 --> 21:08.099
(humming)

21:22.515 --> 21:24.483
Oh, you're up.

21:24.517 --> 21:26.152
I was afraid
I drained you too much.

21:26.184 --> 21:28.186
I do that sometimes.

21:28.220 --> 21:31.022
(snarling)

21:31.057 --> 21:33.759
Ever have a tune you can't
get out of your head?

21:33.792 --> 21:38.263
It keeps playing over
and over and over?

21:38.297 --> 21:39.632
It drives me nuts.

21:46.204 --> 21:47.374
Ah.

21:47.406 --> 21:49.307
Thank you.

21:49.342 --> 21:51.377
(grunting)

21:51.411 --> 21:54.346
That is much better.

21:59.317 --> 22:00.420
Mmm.

22:05.592 --> 22:07.192
It's a game, you know.

22:07.226 --> 22:09.228
We're not gonna play
by their rules,

22:09.260 --> 22:12.531
but... that doesn't mean
we're not going to play.

22:12.565 --> 22:16.301
Mmm, why don't you call
your friend in?

22:16.335 --> 22:18.738
We'll, uh,
discuss it over dinner.

22:31.784 --> 22:33.786
Quentin?

22:57.777 --> 22:59.778
Hello?

23:02.213 --> 23:03.682
Quentin?

23:03.715 --> 23:05.718
Hob--

23:55.634 --> 23:57.636
Oh!

24:08.380 --> 24:10.782
(indistinct chatter)

24:19.959 --> 24:22.461
Let's find out, huh?

24:22.494 --> 24:24.029
Hey, sweet girl.

24:24.063 --> 24:27.098
How much for a lap dance
for me and my buddy?

24:27.133 --> 24:28.667
Yeah.

24:32.038 --> 24:34.472
(laughter)

24:37.076 --> 24:39.679
Walk me home, Angel?
No, I'm fine.

24:39.711 --> 24:42.347
I can take care of myself.

24:42.381 --> 24:44.450
(humming nearby)

24:44.482 --> 24:47.419
Hummers.
Big turnoff.

24:48.855 --> 24:51.824
I like guys that can
remember the lyrics.

24:51.857 --> 24:53.491
You know, I wish I could,

24:53.526 --> 24:55.561
but my mind just isn't
what it used to be.

24:55.595 --> 24:57.028
Let me go.

24:57.063 --> 24:58.163
You didn't say please.

24:58.197 --> 25:00.298
Get... off me!

25:00.332 --> 25:02.101
Somebody, please!

25:03.169 --> 25:05.070
Aah!
Help me, please!

25:05.104 --> 25:06.705
Somebody!

25:08.339 --> 25:11.109
Somebody, please help me!

25:15.181 --> 25:17.549
No!
No!

25:24.790 --> 25:27.093
(screams)

25:31.631 --> 25:32.765
Stop!

25:32.798 --> 25:34.333
Please, I need help!

25:34.365 --> 25:35.401
(horn honks)

25:35.433 --> 25:36.769
(tires screech)

25:36.802 --> 25:38.136
Please, stop!

25:39.038 --> 25:40.940
(horn honks)

25:44.743 --> 25:46.244
Hurry!
(Buffy screams)

26:01.594 --> 26:04.462
When I hit him, it felt
like my arm was broken,

26:04.496 --> 26:06.231
it hurt so much.

26:07.432 --> 26:09.434
I can't be just a person.

26:09.468 --> 26:12.939
I can't be helpless like that.

26:12.971 --> 26:15.106
Giles, please, we have to figure
out what's happening to me.

26:23.249 --> 26:26.585
It's an organic compound

26:26.618 --> 26:31.089
of muscle relaxants
and adrenal suppressors.

26:34.526 --> 26:36.561
The effect is temporary.

26:36.595 --> 26:38.596
You'll be yourself again
in a few days.

26:43.535 --> 26:45.938
You?

26:47.773 --> 26:50.608
It's a test, Buffy.

26:50.643 --> 26:54.079
It's given to the
slayer once she--

26:54.113 --> 26:58.317
well, if she reaches
her 18th birthday.

26:58.349 --> 27:00.318
The slayer is

27:00.352 --> 27:02.453
disabled

27:02.488 --> 27:05.523
and then entrapped
with a vampire foe

27:05.557 --> 27:08.326
whom she must defeat in
order to pass the test.

27:11.029 --> 27:13.766
The vampire you were to face

27:13.799 --> 27:15.534
has escaped.

27:17.502 --> 27:20.538
His name is Zackary Kralik.

27:20.571 --> 27:24.476
As a mortal, he
murdered and tortured

27:24.509 --> 27:26.444
more than a dozen
women before he was

27:26.478 --> 27:29.682
committed to an asylum
for the criminally insane.

27:29.715 --> 27:31.650
When a--

27:31.683 --> 27:33.652
You bastard.

27:33.685 --> 27:36.855
All this time, you saw
what it was doing to me.

27:36.888 --> 27:39.490
All this time,
and you didn't say a word.

27:39.525 --> 27:41.059
I wanted to.

27:41.093 --> 27:42.694
Liar.

27:42.729 --> 27:44.029
In matters of
tradition and protocol,

27:44.063 --> 27:45.197
I must answer to the Council.

27:45.230 --> 27:47.133
My role in this

27:47.165 --> 27:50.469
was very specific.

27:50.501 --> 27:52.471
I was to administer
the injections

27:52.503 --> 27:54.405
and to direct you

27:54.440 --> 27:56.208
to the old boardinghouse
on Prescott Lane.

27:56.241 --> 27:58.544
I can't.
I can't hear this.

27:58.576 --> 27:59.878
Buffy, please.

28:02.714 --> 28:05.984
Who are you?

28:06.018 --> 28:08.554
How could you do this to me?

28:08.586 --> 28:10.757
I am deeply sorry, Buffy,
and you have to understand--

28:10.789 --> 28:13.925
If you touch me,
I'll kill you.

28:16.194 --> 28:17.930
You have to listen to me.

28:17.963 --> 28:19.530
Because I've
told you this,

28:19.565 --> 28:21.700
the test is
invalidated.

28:21.733 --> 28:24.603
You will be safe now.
I promise you.

28:24.635 --> 28:26.672
Whatever I have to do
to deal with Kralik

28:26.704 --> 28:29.107
and to win back your trust--

28:29.141 --> 28:31.343
You stuck a needle in me.

28:31.376 --> 28:33.711
You poisoned me.

28:33.746 --> 28:35.914
(footsteps approaching)

28:35.948 --> 28:37.415
What's going on?

28:38.584 --> 28:39.885
Oh, God.

28:39.919 --> 28:41.420
Is the world ending?

28:41.452 --> 28:43.422
I have to research a paper
on Bosnia for tomorrow,

28:43.454 --> 28:45.457
but if the world's ending,
I'm not gonna bother.

28:48.827 --> 28:50.561
You can't walk home
alone, Buffy.

28:50.596 --> 28:52.330
It isn't safe.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.435
I don't know you.

28:59.171 --> 29:00.972
Did something take her memory?

29:01.007 --> 29:02.574
He's Giles.

29:02.607 --> 29:05.076
Gi-les.

29:05.111 --> 29:07.246
He hangs out here a lot.

29:09.080 --> 29:11.482
Cordelia, could you
please drive me home?

29:11.517 --> 29:13.920
Of course.

29:15.753 --> 29:17.556
But if the world doesn't end,

29:17.588 --> 29:19.625
I'm gonna need a note.

29:24.663 --> 29:26.531
(creaking)

29:41.646 --> 29:43.481
Buffy?

29:50.056 --> 29:51.958
Mother.

29:58.663 --> 30:01.067
*

30:41.173 --> 30:43.142
KRALIK:
 Mother?

30:43.174 --> 30:45.810
(camera clicks)

30:45.844 --> 30:48.380
May I call you mother?

30:49.748 --> 30:51.917
My own mother

30:51.951 --> 30:54.319
was a person with no
self-respect of her own,

30:54.353 --> 30:56.688
so she tried to take mine.

30:56.721 --> 30:58.523
(camera clicks)

30:58.557 --> 31:00.858
Ten years old,
she had the scissors.

31:00.893 --> 31:03.429
You wouldn't believe
what she took with those.

31:05.763 --> 31:07.066
But she's dead
to me now.

31:09.535 --> 31:10.536
Mostly...
(giggles)

31:10.568 --> 31:12.270
because I killed
and ate her,

31:12.304 --> 31:15.340
but also because I know

31:15.374 --> 31:17.709
I won't be alone much longer.

31:17.742 --> 31:20.211
I'll have your daughter.

31:20.246 --> 31:23.214
I won't kill her, I'll
just make her like me.

31:23.249 --> 31:26.684
Different.

31:26.718 --> 31:28.287
She'll go to sleep,

31:28.319 --> 31:31.589
and when she
wakes up, your face

31:31.623 --> 31:34.625
will be the first
thing she eats.

31:37.663 --> 31:39.464
I have a problem with mothers.

31:39.498 --> 31:41.467
I'm aware of that.

32:01.287 --> 32:03.288
*

32:26.345 --> 32:28.346
*

32:54.339 --> 32:56.342
*

33:20.865 --> 33:22.968
I was just trying
to reach you.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.570
I was on watch
over by the boardinghouse.

33:25.604 --> 33:27.538
Then you know what's happened.

33:27.573 --> 33:29.240
Yes.

33:29.275 --> 33:31.410
He's killed Hobson and made
Blair one of his own.

33:31.442 --> 33:35.213
Your perfectly controlled test

33:35.247 --> 33:37.383
seems to have spun rather
impressively out of control,

33:37.415 --> 33:39.417
don't you think?

33:42.121 --> 33:43.855
It changes nothing.

33:43.888 --> 33:45.923
Well, then, allow me.

33:45.957 --> 33:48.693
I've told Buffy everything.

33:49.795 --> 33:51.230
That is in direct opposition

33:51.262 --> 33:52.931
to the Council's orders.

33:52.963 --> 33:55.233
Yes. Interestingly,
I don't give a rat's ass

33:55.267 --> 33:57.769
about the Council's orders.
There will be no test.

33:57.802 --> 34:00.038
The test has already begun.

34:00.071 --> 34:02.607
Your slayer
entered the field of play

34:02.641 --> 34:04.942
about ten minutes ago.
Why?

34:04.976 --> 34:07.045
I don't know.
I returned there

34:07.078 --> 34:08.780
just as she entered.

34:08.813 --> 34:10.014
Giles, we've no business...

34:10.047 --> 34:12.050
This is not business.

34:37.775 --> 34:40.346
(grunting)

34:41.612 --> 34:43.181
(growling)

34:48.018 --> 34:50.255
(grunting)

35:23.822 --> 35:27.559
KRALIK:
Hide-and-seek.

35:30.829 --> 35:32.963
Hide-and-seek.

35:46.478 --> 35:48.045
(exclaims)

35:48.079 --> 35:50.581
Why did you come
to the dark of the woods?

35:52.351 --> 35:54.420
To bring all these sweets
to grandmother's house.

36:06.097 --> 36:07.132
(laughs)

36:07.164 --> 36:08.367
(sizzling)
Oh, oh, no, no--

36:08.400 --> 36:09.701
just a little lower.
Right...

36:09.735 --> 36:11.969
Oh, yes, yes.

36:12.003 --> 36:13.972
Oh. (gasps)

36:14.005 --> 36:15.039
Oh.

36:15.072 --> 36:17.175
Thank you very much.

36:22.748 --> 36:24.750
(banging)

36:29.387 --> 36:31.389
(banging stops)

37:00.485 --> 37:02.487
(grunting)

37:28.780 --> 37:30.782
(lock clicks)

37:47.865 --> 37:49.867
(banging)

37:58.777 --> 38:02.146
If you stray from the path,
you will lose your way.

38:02.179 --> 38:03.914
(grunting)

38:03.949 --> 38:05.416
I won't take it all.

38:05.451 --> 38:07.284
I won't take it all.
No, no!

38:08.454 --> 38:10.456
Aah! Aah...
(grunting)

38:24.969 --> 38:27.304
No... No! No!

38:30.307 --> 38:31.409
(grunts)

38:37.181 --> 38:39.083
Buffy?

38:40.985 --> 38:42.219
Buffy,
we have to get home.

38:42.253 --> 38:43.521
(banging)

38:45.891 --> 38:49.427
Where are they?
Where are they?!

39:05.010 --> 39:08.146
Ah. Ah.

39:08.179 --> 39:10.181
(exhales)

39:12.083 --> 39:15.521
You... you don't seem

39:15.554 --> 39:18.389
to understand your place
in all of this.

39:18.423 --> 39:20.425
Do you have any ide...

39:22.027 --> 39:23.661
Oh, my.

39:23.695 --> 39:25.896
What have you...

39:25.931 --> 39:27.032
My pills.

39:28.634 --> 39:30.235
(grunts, groans)

39:33.472 --> 39:36.273
No. No.

39:36.306 --> 39:37.909
No!

39:37.943 --> 39:39.510
If I was at full slayer power,

39:39.545 --> 39:41.679
I'd be punning right about now.

39:41.713 --> 39:44.349
No! Aah!

39:44.382 --> 39:47.619
Aah!

39:53.090 --> 39:55.092
Buffy, thank God you're okay.

39:55.126 --> 39:56.628
Oh, that man...

39:56.661 --> 39:58.896
(grunts)

39:58.929 --> 40:01.199
I can't get these.
They're too tight.

40:01.231 --> 40:03.068
Can't you just...

40:03.101 --> 40:05.235
Not right now.

40:05.269 --> 40:06.972
Maybe there's some
clippers around.

40:07.005 --> 40:09.273
(growling)
Oh, Buffy!

40:14.311 --> 40:15.681
(grunts)

40:25.356 --> 40:28.559
TRAVERS:
 Congratulations, you passed.

40:28.594 --> 40:31.096
You exhibited
extraordinary courage

40:31.128 --> 40:33.898
and clearheadedness
in battle. The Council

40:33.931 --> 40:36.101
is very pleased.

40:36.134 --> 40:38.302
Do I get a gold star?

40:38.335 --> 40:40.304
I understand
that you're upset...

40:40.338 --> 40:42.306
You understand nothing.

40:42.340 --> 40:44.442
You set that monster loose

40:44.476 --> 40:46.277
and he came after my mother.

40:46.311 --> 40:48.346
You think the test was unfair?

40:48.378 --> 40:50.114
I think you better leave town

40:50.148 --> 40:52.150
before I get my strength back.

40:53.818 --> 40:55.653
We're not in the business
of fair, Miss Summers.

40:55.686 --> 40:57.088
We're fighting a war.

40:57.121 --> 40:58.690
You're waging a war.
She's fighting it.

40:58.724 --> 41:00.090
There is a difference.

41:00.125 --> 41:02.260
Mr. Giles,
if you don't mind...

41:02.293 --> 41:03.862
The test is done.
We're finished.

41:03.894 --> 41:05.931
Not quite. She passed.

41:05.963 --> 41:08.132
You didn't.

41:08.166 --> 41:09.668
The slayer is not
the only one

41:09.701 --> 41:12.003
who must perform
in this situation.

41:12.036 --> 41:15.306
I've recommended to the Council,
and they've agreed,

41:15.340 --> 41:18.376
that you be relieved of your
duties as watcher immediately.

41:18.409 --> 41:19.677
You're fired.

41:21.478 --> 41:23.313
On what grounds?

41:23.347 --> 41:26.617
Your affection for your charge
has rendered you incapable

41:26.652 --> 41:29.153
of clear and impartial judgment.

41:29.186 --> 41:32.990
You have a father's
love for the child,

41:33.023 --> 41:34.492
and that is useless

41:34.525 --> 41:36.161
to the cause.

41:36.193 --> 41:37.963
It would be best

41:37.996 --> 41:41.365
if you had no further
contact with the slayer.

41:41.398 --> 41:43.201
I'm not going anywhere.
No, well,

41:43.233 --> 41:45.536
I didn't expect
you would adhere to that.

41:45.570 --> 41:48.072
However, if you interfere
with the new watcher

41:48.106 --> 41:50.809
or countermand
his authority in any way,

41:50.842 --> 41:52.510
you will be dealt with.

41:52.543 --> 41:54.244
Are we clear?

41:54.278 --> 41:56.213
Oh, we're very clear.

41:57.849 --> 41:59.851
Congratulations again.

42:02.219 --> 42:03.588
Bite me.

42:04.590 --> 42:06.224
Yes.

42:06.257 --> 42:07.492
Well...

42:07.525 --> 42:09.728
Colorful girl.

43:00.344 --> 43:01.980
I can't believe
Giles was fired.

43:02.012 --> 43:03.949
How could Giles get fired?

43:03.981 --> 43:05.650
So, how did you manage
to kill Kralik?

43:05.684 --> 43:09.119
Oh, she was very clever.

43:09.153 --> 43:10.889
Uh, you go ahead
and tell it, dear.

43:10.922 --> 43:12.422
You tell it better.

43:12.456 --> 43:14.092
Now... now,
when you say "fired",

43:14.125 --> 43:15.592
do you mean fired?

43:15.626 --> 43:17.094
You're not cruising
past that concept

43:17.128 --> 43:18.764
any time soon, are you?

43:18.797 --> 43:21.431
Well, it's just...
I mean, he's been fired.

43:21.465 --> 43:22.833
He's-he's unemployed.

43:22.867 --> 43:25.670
He's... between jobs.

43:25.704 --> 43:29.173
Giles isn't going anywhere,
Will. He's still librarian.

43:29.206 --> 43:31.576
Okay, but I'm writing
an angry letter.
You know, nothing's

43:31.608 --> 43:32.943
really gonna change.

43:32.978 --> 43:34.579
The important thing
is that I kept up

43:34.612 --> 43:35.813
my special birthday tradition

43:35.847 --> 43:38.349
of gut-wrenching misery
and horror.

43:38.382 --> 43:39.951
Bright side to everything.

43:41.786 --> 43:44.588
I'll just feel better
when I get my strength back.

43:44.621 --> 43:46.623
Give you a hand
with that, little lady?

43:48.626 --> 43:51.596
You're loving this far too much.

43:51.628 --> 43:54.465
Admit it. Sometimes you
just need a big strong man.

44:01.306 --> 44:03.307
Uh, Will, give me a hand
with that?

44:37.842 --> 44:40.277
Grr. Argh.
