[Dale reading]<i> Dear</i>

00:30.720 --> 00:34.680
<i>Chief Ken, I am writing you</i>

00:30.720 --> 00:34.680
<i>from the city Shanghai</i>

00:34.800 --> 00:38.480
<i>in a country</i>

00:34.800 --> 00:38.480

00:34.800 --> 00:38.480

00:38.600 --> 00:41.560
<i>Sorry I took off at Christmas</i>

00:38.600 --> 00:41.560
<i>without saying goodbye.</i>

00:41.680 --> 00:45.320
<i>It all got so complicated,</i>

00:41.680 --> 00:45.320
<i>I had a lot of thinking to do.</i>

00:45.440 --> 00:47.920
<i>Lichfield, England</i>

00:45.440 --> 00:47.920

00:48.040 --> 00:50.640
<i>But Lady Luck's been</i>

00:48.040 --> 00:50.640
<i>kind to me these</i>

00:48.040 --> 00:50.640

00:50.760 --> 00:55.640
<i>I have a place to live and</i>

00:50.760 --> 00:55.640

00:55.760 --> 00:59.800
<i>Yes, Chief Ken,</i>

00:55.760 --> 00:59.800
<i>I can say at last</i>

00:55.760 --> 00:59.800
<i>with absolute certainty</i>

00:59.920 --> 01:02.440
<i>that everything</i>

00:59.920 --> 01:02.440
<i>is going my way!</i>

01:06.560 --> 01:08.800
Oh, hey guys!

01:08.920 --> 01:11.040
That was a great

01:08.920 --> 01:11.040
party last night.

01:11.160 --> 01:13.000
It was your birthday,

01:11.160 --> 01:13.000
right, Hwang?

01:13.120 --> 01:15.920
Little too much rice wine?

01:13.120 --> 01:15.920
You little tearaway!

01:16.040 --> 01:19.840
Let me see.

01:16.040 --> 01:19.840
Three cold ones

01:16.040 --> 01:19.840
coming right up.

01:19.960 --> 01:22.080
You fool around

01:19.960 --> 01:22.080
with Mr. X's property

01:22.200 --> 01:23.840
Now you must pay the price.

01:23.960 --> 01:27.400
He found out.

01:23.960 --> 01:27.400
Is he real mad?

01:28.680 --> 01:29.840
[shouting]

01:34.040 --> 01:35.320
[grunting]

01:41.160 --> 01:43.240
Oh, sorry, I forgot

01:41.160 --> 01:43.240
that was there.

01:54.520 --> 01:56.600
I just cleaned

01:54.520 --> 01:56.600
the place yesterday.

02:05.760 --> 02:07.600
Whew!

02:07.720 --> 02:10.360
Now that's my exercise

02:07.720 --> 02:10.360
for the day.

02:21.760 --> 02:25.440
Well that's not fair, Lu Hong,

02:21.760 --> 02:25.440
I taught you how to nunchuck.

02:39.760 --> 02:44.000
Now look guys,

02:39.760 --> 02:44.000
we're all going to laugh

02:39.760 --> 02:44.000
about this someday,

02:44.120 --> 02:46.640
but for now I should

02:44.120 --> 02:46.640
probably get on a plane.

02:49.560 --> 02:51.160
Definitely get on a plane.

03:06.120 --> 03:07.520
Forty minutes?

03:07.640 --> 03:10.160
Mate, my wife is about

03:07.640 --> 03:10.160
to give birth here.

03:10.280 --> 03:14.080
Twenty minutes! Yep, we

03:10.280 --> 03:14.080
can hold on for that long.

03:14.200 --> 03:17.360
Right. I'll have

03:14.200 --> 03:17.360
a Prawn Jalfrezi.

03:17.480 --> 03:19.840
A chicken bhuna.

03:17.480 --> 03:19.840
Naans, all of them,

03:19.960 --> 03:20.960
peshwari, keema.

03:21.080 --> 03:22.440
Tandoori special.

03:22.560 --> 03:24.440
Tandoori special

03:22.560 --> 03:24.440
for four.

03:24.560 --> 03:26.160
Lovely, thank you.

03:26.280 --> 03:28.360
Well remembered,

03:26.280 --> 03:28.360
Dylan. What?

03:28.480 --> 03:31.240
The baby's a week late.

03:28.480 --> 03:31.240
Curry induces labor.

03:31.360 --> 03:33.720
We've had it three times

03:31.360 --> 03:33.720
this week, greedy guts.

03:33.840 --> 03:35.640
It's nothing to do

03:33.840 --> 03:35.640
with being greedy.

03:35.760 --> 03:38.680
This is a rare occasions

03:35.760 --> 03:38.680
in life where doing

03:35.760 --> 03:38.680
the right thing

03:38.800 --> 03:40.280
is also doing

03:38.800 --> 03:40.280
the tasty thing.

03:40.400 --> 03:42.640
Besides, you need

03:40.400 --> 03:42.640
to keep your strength up.

03:42.760 --> 03:45.040
It's going to be tough

03:42.760 --> 03:45.040
when the baby arrives.

03:45.160 --> 03:48.440
Yeah. Ken, you know

03:45.160 --> 03:48.440
these new branches

03:45.160 --> 03:48.440
we're opening

03:48.560 --> 03:49.920
-in Sutton Coldfield?

03:48.560 --> 03:49.920
-Yeah?

03:50.040 --> 03:53.240
Rachna asked today if

03:50.040 --> 03:53.240
I'd oversee them.

03:53.360 --> 03:55.600
Sort of head honcho.

03:55.720 --> 03:57.120
Congratulations, love.

03:57.240 --> 03:59.920
Thanks Ken!

03:57.240 --> 03:59.920
They want me to

03:57.240 --> 03:59.920
start straight away.

04:01.040 --> 04:02.680
Erm... Hang on.

04:02.800 --> 04:04.440
So I was thinking

04:02.800 --> 04:04.440
this time round

04:04.560 --> 04:06.320
you might handle

04:04.560 --> 04:06.320
the baby duties.

04:07.520 --> 04:10.120
Paternity leave?

04:07.520 --> 04:10.120
Oh, I don't think so!

04:10.240 --> 04:11.680
Oh, this is jokes!

04:11.800 --> 04:13.120
Interesting. Why not?

04:13.240 --> 04:15.480
Well it's a bit sudden.

04:13.240 --> 04:15.480
You'd have sprung it on me.

04:15.600 --> 04:17.880
Sort of like you sprang

04:15.600 --> 04:17.880
a baby on me.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.720
By lying about

04:18.000 --> 04:19.720
your vasectomy.

04:19.840 --> 04:21.520
Yes Mum! That's

04:19.840 --> 04:21.520
the knock out!

04:21.640 --> 04:23.360
I mean in

04:21.640 --> 04:23.360
theory, why not?

04:23.480 --> 04:25.800
I should go and speak

04:23.480 --> 04:25.800
to the other partners.

04:25.920 --> 04:28.280
I am hugely

04:25.920 --> 04:28.280
important to the firm.

04:28.400 --> 04:30.360
I'm a king to them,

04:28.400 --> 04:30.360
in my humble way.

04:30.480 --> 04:32.880
Good! You can go

04:30.480 --> 04:32.880
and talk to them

04:30.480 --> 04:32.880
tomorrow.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.440
Yes, I mean all right,

04:33.000 --> 04:35.440
I'll go and talk to them.

04:35.560 --> 04:36.760
Great.

04:36.880 --> 04:39.280
Ha ha! Dad's going to look

04:36.880 --> 04:39.280
after the baby.

04:39.400 --> 04:42.640
Give it its bockle

04:39.400 --> 04:42.640
and wear a pinny and be

04:39.400 --> 04:42.640
the "pwimawy cawer".

04:42.760 --> 04:44.880
Shut up. I'm not

04:42.760 --> 04:44.880
mentioning this at work.

04:45.000 --> 04:49.560
As soon as your mother lays

04:45.000 --> 04:49.560
eyes on that baby, and that

04:45.000 --> 04:49.560
oxytocin hormone starts flowing,

04:49.680 --> 04:56.040
all thoughts of paternity leave

04:49.680 --> 04:56.040
will exit her mind. No,

04:49.680 --> 04:56.040
I'm just gonna ride it out.

04:56.160 --> 04:59.280
Yeah, sweet plan, Dad. Now give

04:56.160 --> 04:59.280
me twenty quid or I'll tell Mum.

05:03.320 --> 05:04.720
Oh, Dylan,

05:04.840 --> 05:06.880
when you go to university

05:04.840 --> 05:06.880
and leave home,

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
Yeah. What?

05:09.120 --> 05:10.000
Nothing. It's just

05:09.120 --> 05:10.000
a wonderful thought!

05:10.440 --> 05:11.840
Bell-end.

05:11.960 --> 05:13.280
[bell ringing]

05:13.400 --> 05:15.760
Yummy yum!

05:13.400 --> 05:15.760
Here you are--

05:17.240 --> 05:21.160
Chief Ken!

05:17.240 --> 05:21.160
It's me, Dale!

05:21.960 --> 05:23.520
What the hell?

05:23.640 --> 05:24.760
Long time no see!

05:26.080 --> 05:31.480
Dale! Well, come on,

05:26.080 --> 05:31.480
come in!

05:26.080 --> 05:31.480
Lorna, it's Dale!

05:32.480 --> 05:34.720
Touchdown at

05:32.480 --> 05:34.720
Thompson Towers!

05:34.840 --> 05:39.000
And so concludes another

05:34.840 --> 05:39.000
marathon session in the drinking

05:34.840 --> 05:39.000
establishments of Lichfield!

05:39.120 --> 05:41.480
Thanks for being

05:39.120 --> 05:41.480
designated driver.

05:41.600 --> 05:43.440
God it must be

05:41.600 --> 05:43.440
boring not drinking.

05:43.560 --> 05:46.360
You know me!

05:43.560 --> 05:46.360
Couldn't be boring

05:43.560 --> 05:46.360
if I tried.

05:47.800 --> 05:49.920
Awww! So glad

05:47.800 --> 05:49.920
we stayed friends.

05:50.040 --> 05:52.160
Best friends.

05:50.040 --> 05:52.160
Besties.

05:53.160 --> 05:54.760
Could have easily

05:53.160 --> 05:54.760
been weird,

05:54.880 --> 05:56.280
with us almost

05:54.880 --> 05:56.280
being engaged

05:56.400 --> 05:59.480
Well, technically,

05:56.400 --> 05:59.480
we were engaged.

05:56.400 --> 05:59.480
You said yes.

05:59.600 --> 06:01.480
I said no about

05:59.600 --> 06:01.480
ten seconds later.

06:01.600 --> 06:04.080
So we were engaged

06:01.600 --> 06:04.080
for ten seconds.

06:04.200 --> 06:07.600
The point is you're

06:04.200 --> 06:07.600
still the love of my life.

06:07.720 --> 06:10.640
It's just you're

06:07.720 --> 06:10.640
the friend love

06:07.720 --> 06:10.640
of my life.

06:10.760 --> 06:12.840
It's because it never

06:10.760 --> 06:12.840
really got that good

06:12.960 --> 06:14.640
for us sexually did it?

06:14.760 --> 06:16.080
Yes.

06:16.200 --> 06:21.320
Rachel! Hi Ben!

06:16.200 --> 06:21.320
You have to come in!

06:16.200 --> 06:21.320
Dale's back!

06:21.440 --> 06:22.600
-Oh fuck off!

06:21.440 --> 06:22.600
-Oh my God.

06:27.840 --> 06:30.200
Ben, how do I look?

06:30.320 --> 06:33.160
Not your best. Maybe

06:30.320 --> 06:33.160
just stay in the car.

06:33.280 --> 06:34.880
Wait until he's

06:33.280 --> 06:34.880
gone away again.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.360
No, I'm going in!

06:36.480 --> 06:37.840
Yeah.

06:37.960 --> 06:38.920
Wish me luck!

06:39.040 --> 06:41.000
Yeah! You go girl!

06:44.160 --> 06:45.600
Have fun!

06:48.400 --> 06:50.160
Yum, yum

06:48.400 --> 06:50.160
in my tum.

06:50.280 --> 06:52.880
One thing I've missed

06:50.280 --> 06:52.880
while in Asia.

06:50.280 --> 06:52.880
Good curry.

06:53.000 --> 06:57.560
Dale, you look so nice in

06:53.000 --> 06:57.560
your suit. Doesn't he, Rach?

06:57.680 --> 06:59.080
Yeah, very nice.

06:59.200 --> 07:01.320
Mr. Xi had this suit made

06:59.200 --> 07:01.320
for me personally.

07:03.520 --> 07:06.760
Oh! Mr. Xi is my

07:03.520 --> 07:06.760
new mentor.

07:06.880 --> 07:09.680
What a wise and

07:06.880 --> 07:09.680
inspirational man,

07:06.880 --> 07:09.680
lemme tell ya.

07:09.800 --> 07:13.480
Right. He's not

07:09.800 --> 07:13.480
another cult leader,

07:09.800 --> 07:13.480
is he?

07:14.000 --> 07:15.720
[laughing]

07:15.840 --> 07:17.240
Of course not, Lorna!

07:17.360 --> 07:19.080
I learned my lesson

07:17.360 --> 07:19.080
on that one.

07:19.200 --> 07:21.360
You guys must have thought

07:19.200 --> 07:21.360
I was a real dope!

07:21.480 --> 07:23.160
-Well, we did...

07:21.480 --> 07:23.160
-No, we did not!

07:23.280 --> 07:24.560
No.

07:26.040 --> 07:27.680
No! No Mr. Xi

07:26.040 --> 07:27.680
is actually a very

07:26.040 --> 07:27.680
successful business man.

07:27.800 --> 07:30.080
With things going

07:27.800 --> 07:30.080
so great

07:27.800 --> 07:30.080
for you out there,

07:30.200 --> 07:31.880
what brings you

07:30.200 --> 07:31.880
back to Lichfield?

07:32.000 --> 07:35.920
Well, once a man has found

07:32.000 --> 07:35.920
success in his work,

07:36.040 --> 07:38.560
his attention turns

07:36.040 --> 07:38.560
to matters of the heart.

07:38.680 --> 07:41.520
Dale doesn't need to go into

07:38.680 --> 07:41.520
this just now does he?

07:41.640 --> 07:44.000
No. Well, you can stay

07:41.640 --> 07:44.000
as long as you want.

07:44.120 --> 07:47.920
We're doing up your room

07:44.120 --> 07:47.920
for the baby, so you'll have to

07:44.120 --> 07:47.920
stay in Dylan's room.

07:48.040 --> 07:50.040
-That isn't happening.

07:48.040 --> 07:50.040
-That's a great idea.

07:50.160 --> 07:51.760
We'll get the

07:50.160 --> 07:51.760
bunk beds out.

07:51.880 --> 07:53.640
We'll get them

07:51.880 --> 07:53.640
in your ass.

07:51.880 --> 07:53.640
I'm not-

07:54.240 --> 07:55.920
Insubordination!

07:56.040 --> 07:58.400
It's so good

07:56.040 --> 07:58.400
to have you back, Dale.

07:58.520 --> 08:00.240
You can move your

07:58.520 --> 08:00.240
bed out yourself.

08:00.360 --> 08:02.320
I am not touching

08:00.360 --> 08:02.320
your clammy mattress.

08:02.440 --> 08:04.040
[laughing]

08:04.160 --> 08:07.280
[Lorna] He's come back

08:04.160 --> 08:07.280
for Rachel. It's

08:04.160 --> 08:07.280
finally happening.

08:07.400 --> 08:09.840
Love is in

08:07.400 --> 08:09.840
the air, Ken.

08:09.960 --> 08:11.480
Yeah. Well, she

08:09.960 --> 08:11.480
could do worse.

08:11.600 --> 08:12.960
He's a good lad

08:11.600 --> 08:12.960
is Dale.

08:13.080 --> 08:16.040
I mean he's no brainbox,

08:13.080 --> 08:16.040
but he gets stuck in.

08:16.160 --> 08:18.840
I wouldn't want

08:16.160 --> 08:18.840
Rach to move to China.

08:18.960 --> 08:21.720
Although it is

08:18.960 --> 08:21.720
a growing economy,

08:18.960 --> 08:21.720
I read.

08:22.720 --> 08:25.480
Yeah. I dunno.

08:25.600 --> 08:27.400
Rachel's in a bit

08:25.600 --> 08:27.400
of a rut right now.

08:27.520 --> 08:30.200
Maybe change would

08:27.520 --> 08:30.200
do her good.

08:27.520 --> 08:30.200
And if it's Dale...

08:30.320 --> 08:34.720
Who cares if he's her dead

08:30.320 --> 08:34.720
husband's son by a teenage

08:30.320 --> 08:34.720
one-night stand?

08:34.840 --> 08:36.160
As the song goes.

08:36.280 --> 08:37.400
[laughing]

08:37.520 --> 08:39.000
[machine whirring]

08:45.720 --> 08:46.600
Hey.

08:46.960 --> 08:48.360
Hey, Mom!

08:48.480 --> 08:50.720
Me and Dylan

08:48.480 --> 08:50.720
are just buildin'

08:48.480 --> 08:50.720
up these bunk beds.

08:50.840 --> 08:52.880
Do you think

08:50.840 --> 08:52.880
we should drop

08:50.840 --> 08:52.880
the mom thing?

08:53.000 --> 08:55.560
Now, you're back.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.560
And since we have

08:53.000 --> 08:55.560
had sex.

08:55.680 --> 09:00.520
Yeah that makes sense. Maybe

08:55.680 --> 09:00.520
I'll just call you Rachel.

09:00.640 --> 09:04.760
Or Rach. I dunno,

09:00.640 --> 09:04.760
I can't choose.

09:00.640 --> 09:04.760
I like them both.

09:04.880 --> 09:07.880
Dale, I've been thinking.

09:08.000 --> 09:12.040
Last time, you left

09:08.000 --> 09:12.040
so suddenly,

09:08.000 --> 09:12.040
and I felt that we had

09:12.160 --> 09:14.840
some talking to do.

09:14.960 --> 09:17.360
Yes, yes, I'm so glad

09:14.960 --> 09:17.360
you said that!

09:17.480 --> 09:20.160
So maybe we

09:17.480 --> 09:20.160
could go out?

09:20.280 --> 09:22.680
There's a little Italian

09:20.280 --> 09:22.680
on the High Street.

09:22.800 --> 09:24.880
Cool! What does he want?

09:25.000 --> 09:28.440
Oh no, erm,

09:25.000 --> 09:28.440
it's a restaurant

09:25.000 --> 09:28.440
not a person.

09:28.560 --> 09:31.280
Oh, got it. Got it.

09:28.560 --> 09:31.280
I love that.

09:31.400 --> 09:32.520
Okay, cool.

09:32.640 --> 09:34.480
Okay, well.

09:35.840 --> 09:37.200
Night night.

09:37.600 --> 09:38.480
Goodnight.

09:46.080 --> 09:48.480
The car just accelerated

09:46.080 --> 09:48.480
away and...

09:48.600 --> 09:51.640
Hey! How are my

09:48.600 --> 09:51.640
NCT homies?

09:51.760 --> 09:53.200
Ah, Jess,

09:51.760 --> 09:53.200
good to see you!

09:53.320 --> 09:54.520
How's it going?

09:54.640 --> 09:56.920
Oh, ready to pop.

09:57.040 --> 09:59.440
And Mark's still in Dubai,

09:57.040 --> 09:59.440
so... yeah.

09:59.560 --> 10:02.240
Poor, deserted,

09:59.560 --> 10:02.240
pregnant Jess.

10:02.360 --> 10:04.240
Oh, it's a crying shame.

10:04.360 --> 10:05.840
Well, he sends checks.

10:05.960 --> 10:08.040
Maybe I should

10:05.960 --> 10:08.040
buy a man in!

10:08.160 --> 10:11.240
How much for this one?

10:11.360 --> 10:13.840
Too much for anyone.

10:11.360 --> 10:13.840
I sell by the pound!

10:17.120 --> 10:18.280
Yeah. All right.

10:18.400 --> 10:20.080
We're actually

10:18.400 --> 10:20.080
overdue now.

10:20.200 --> 10:24.120
Oh well, friend of mine swears

10:20.200 --> 10:24.120
the only thing that works

10:24.240 --> 10:25.960
is nipple stimulation.

10:26.080 --> 10:28.920
Oh yeah? Oh we'll have

10:26.080 --> 10:28.920
to give that a go.

10:29.040 --> 10:31.880
Us? Ken, you are naughty!

10:32.000 --> 10:36.080
Oh! Oh no. Oh hell, no.

10:32.000 --> 10:36.080
No, I meant Lorna and I.

10:36.200 --> 10:39.840
Oh! Of course!

10:36.200 --> 10:39.840
Of course!

10:39.960 --> 10:43.880
Oh! You two are,

10:39.960 --> 10:43.880
you are the sweetest!

10:44.000 --> 10:45.840
I could just eat you up!

10:47.600 --> 10:52.520
Anyway, better run,

10:47.600 --> 10:52.520
so see you on

10:47.600 --> 10:52.520
the other side!

10:52.640 --> 10:55.600
Bye. Good luck.

10:55.720 --> 10:57.120
She is the worst!

10:57.240 --> 10:58.320
I like her.

10:58.440 --> 11:00.680
Because she fancies you.

11:00.800 --> 11:03.240
I love you for

11:00.800 --> 11:03.240
even thinking

11:00.800 --> 11:03.240
it's a possibility.

11:06.880 --> 11:09.320
Right, so if

11:06.880 --> 11:09.320
I can summarize,

11:09.440 --> 11:12.240
Adrian totally cocked things up

11:09.440 --> 11:12.240
and now they're suing us.

11:12.360 --> 11:14.960
Not a great result. But

11:12.360 --> 11:14.960
I gave it a hundred percent.

11:15.080 --> 11:17.680
Well, as long

11:15.080 --> 11:17.680
as you tried.

11:17.800 --> 11:19.760
All right, thank you,

11:17.800 --> 11:19.760
meeting adjourned.

11:19.880 --> 11:21.720
Sorry, wait everyone!

11:21.840 --> 11:23.440
Aren't you

11:21.840 --> 11:23.440
forgetting something?

11:24.080 --> 11:25.160
I don't think so.

11:25.280 --> 11:27.480
All of you,

11:25.280 --> 11:27.480
sit down!

11:27.600 --> 11:31.280
Ken, you drongo,

11:27.600 --> 11:31.280
you forgot to

11:27.600 --> 11:31.280
ask for paternity leave.

11:31.400 --> 11:32.480
What are you doing?

11:32.600 --> 11:34.400
Lorna texted me

11:32.600 --> 11:34.400
to remind you.

11:36.400 --> 11:40.120
So, everyone, Ken really, really

11:36.400 --> 11:40.120
wants six months paid leave to

11:36.400 --> 11:40.120
look after his baby.

11:41.960 --> 11:45.120
You do realize you're supposed

11:41.960 --> 11:45.120
to give six weeks notice?

11:45.240 --> 11:47.760
You really are putting us in

11:45.240 --> 11:47.760
a difficult position.

11:47.880 --> 11:50.760
Aw! So, it's a no then.

11:50.880 --> 11:53.040
That is a shame.

11:50.880 --> 11:53.040
Well, Ben,

11:50.880 --> 11:53.040
better text Lorna

11:53.160 --> 11:54.920
and let her know.

11:53.160 --> 11:54.920
Thank you everyone.

11:55.040 --> 11:56.960
It would be

11:55.040 --> 11:56.960
an inspiring example

11:57.080 --> 11:58.560
to the female workforce.

11:58.680 --> 11:59.960
I think I like it.

12:00.080 --> 12:02.640
Jane, are you

12:00.080 --> 12:02.640
on crazy pills?

12:02.760 --> 12:04.800
We can't do without Ken.

12:04.920 --> 12:06.840
He's the Big Daddy.

12:06.960 --> 12:08.800
The Grand Old Duke of Law.

12:08.920 --> 12:11.320
He makes it rain like

12:08.920 --> 12:11.320
bloody nimbostratus.

12:11.440 --> 12:13.080
I mean, looking at it

12:11.440 --> 12:13.080
objectively,

12:13.200 --> 12:14.440
I do see Adrian's point.

12:14.560 --> 12:15.880
We're big boys and girls.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.320
I think we can

12:16.000 --> 12:17.320
handle it.

12:17.440 --> 12:18.560
We'll be fine.

12:19.800 --> 12:21.040
Brave words, guys.

12:19.800 --> 12:21.040
But let's not be cursory.

12:22.560 --> 12:24.160
Adrian, maybe unpack what you

12:22.560 --> 12:24.160
were saying a little bit more.

12:24.280 --> 12:25.400
Well, I don't know...

12:26.720 --> 12:27.960
Yes you do.

12:26.720 --> 12:27.960
Why shouldn't I do

12:26.720 --> 12:27.960
paternity leave?

12:28.080 --> 12:29.120
Ken's the rainmaker.

12:29.240 --> 12:30.440
You've said that.

12:30.560 --> 12:32.320
Let's all vote.

12:32.440 --> 12:34.520
Who's for Ken's

12:32.440 --> 12:34.520
paternity leave?

12:35.640 --> 12:37.920
That's three for.

12:35.640 --> 12:37.920
And against?

12:42.000 --> 12:43.320
Three against.

12:45.120 --> 12:47.520
With a senior partner

12:45.120 --> 12:47.520
having the deciding vote.

12:48.680 --> 12:50.440
Ken, are you

12:48.680 --> 12:50.440
really voting against

12:50.560 --> 12:51.840
your own paternity leave?

12:53.880 --> 12:56.520
No. I must have

12:53.880 --> 12:56.520
got confused.

12:56.640 --> 13:00.440
I'm voting for it. Because

12:56.640 --> 13:00.440
that's what I want.

13:00.560 --> 13:03.360
Great, so Ken's going

13:00.560 --> 13:03.360
on paternity leave.

13:03.480 --> 13:06.360
While he's away,

13:03.480 --> 13:06.360
I'll have to

13:03.480 --> 13:06.360
take up the reins.

13:06.480 --> 13:10.000
Fantastic! Okay, Ken.

13:06.480 --> 13:10.000
See you in six months.

13:17.080 --> 13:19.200
You would love the food!

13:19.320 --> 13:21.680
They have this dish,

13:19.320 --> 13:21.680
Chicken Chop Suey.

13:21.800 --> 13:23.680
You've tasted

13:21.800 --> 13:23.680
nothing like it.

13:23.800 --> 13:26.520
Makes me miss traveling,

13:23.800 --> 13:26.520
listening to you.

13:26.640 --> 13:28.120
Traveling is so much fun!

13:28.240 --> 13:32.440
So are you heading back

13:28.240 --> 13:32.440
to China anytime soon?

13:32.560 --> 13:35.480
Well, I mean it kinda depends on

13:32.560 --> 13:35.480
what happens while I'm here.

13:36.680 --> 13:38.720
[both] We should talk

13:36.680 --> 13:38.720
about Christmas.

13:38.840 --> 13:40.000
[laughing]

13:40.120 --> 13:42.360
Oh! Spooky!

13:40.120 --> 13:42.360
Okay you go first!

13:42.480 --> 13:45.920
No, you go. Just say

13:42.480 --> 13:45.920
how you feel.

13:46.040 --> 13:49.400
Look, I was so cut up when you

13:46.040 --> 13:49.400
said we couldn't be together.

13:50.840 --> 13:53.640
You see I was taught to

13:50.840 --> 13:53.640
believe each person on earth

13:53.760 --> 13:55.680
was given only one love.

13:56.960 --> 13:59.800
I suppose I just got

13:56.960 --> 13:59.800
to believe in

13:56.960 --> 13:59.800
second chances.

14:01.720 --> 14:05.240
I have fallen for

14:01.720 --> 14:05.240
a truly special girl.

14:07.520 --> 14:12.480
Someone who's

14:07.520 --> 14:12.480
beautiful and kind

14:07.520 --> 14:12.480
and clever.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.400
And funny.

14:15.520 --> 14:20.640
Oh yeah? What's

14:15.520 --> 14:20.640
her name, this girl?

14:20.760 --> 14:21.840
Ling.

14:23.040 --> 14:27.680
Ling? Who the

14:23.040 --> 14:27.680
fuck is Ling?

14:23.040 --> 14:27.680
I mean Ling?

14:27.800 --> 14:29.640
She lives in

14:27.800 --> 14:29.640
Shanghai, China.

14:29.760 --> 14:31.560
She's Mr. Xi's

14:29.760 --> 14:31.560
daughter actually.

14:31.680 --> 14:34.560
We fell madly in love.

14:34.680 --> 14:36.560
But Mr. Xi didn't

14:34.680 --> 14:36.560
quite approve of it.

14:36.680 --> 14:38.240
He had me

14:36.680 --> 14:38.240
chased out of town.

14:40.040 --> 14:41.520
I've got to lie low

14:40.040 --> 14:41.520
a little bit until Ling can

14:40.040 --> 14:41.520
talk her dad around.

14:41.640 --> 14:43.040
So you're in love

14:41.640 --> 14:43.040
with Ling?

14:43.160 --> 14:44.040
Yeah!

14:45.040 --> 14:45.760
You're here hiding

14:45.040 --> 14:45.760
from her Dad,

14:45.880 --> 14:47.680
that's really great.

14:49.160 --> 14:51.280
I am so lucky.

14:51.400 --> 14:56.360
How many other husbands would

14:51.400 --> 14:56.360
just drop their career because

14:51.400 --> 14:56.360
it is the fair thing to do?

14:56.480 --> 15:01.080
Yeah. You're right.

14:56.480 --> 15:01.080
I am a great guy.

15:01.200 --> 15:06.440
Having said that, now I've

15:01.200 --> 15:06.440
shown my willingness to do

15:01.200 --> 15:06.440
paternity leave,

15:06.560 --> 15:12.520
maybe it's time to ask, would

15:06.560 --> 15:12.520
it be better if I didn't take

15:06.560 --> 15:12.520
paternity leave?

15:12.640 --> 15:15.160
I don't know Lorn,

15:12.640 --> 15:15.160
maybe it would.

15:15.280 --> 15:17.160
Ken, grow up.

15:17.280 --> 15:19.760
Just because you take time off

15:17.280 --> 15:19.760
to look after your own child

15:19.880 --> 15:21.360
does not make you

15:19.880 --> 15:21.360
less of a man.

15:22.160 --> 15:23.400
[bell ringing]

15:24.680 --> 15:26.320
You're not getting

15:24.680 --> 15:26.320
out of this.

15:28.800 --> 15:30.640
Hello Ken!

15:30.760 --> 15:33.920
Steve. We're busy.

15:30.760 --> 15:33.920
Go away.

15:34.040 --> 15:35.440
Not a social call, Ken.

15:37.080 --> 15:37.920
As your family doctor,

15:37.080 --> 15:37.920
I'm here to check on

15:37.080 --> 15:37.920
my patient Lorna.

15:38.040 --> 15:39.400
Hi Steve.

15:39.520 --> 15:41.840
Haven't seen you since

15:39.520 --> 15:41.840
Connie ran off.

15:41.960 --> 15:43.600
You know, I'm just

15:41.960 --> 15:43.600
up the road now.

15:43.720 --> 15:45.560
You should

15:43.720 --> 15:45.560
check out my

15:43.720 --> 15:45.560
new hot-tub.

15:45.680 --> 15:48.200
Got it half price.

15:45.680 --> 15:48.200
The previous owner

15:45.680 --> 15:48.200
died in it.

15:48.320 --> 15:50.440
Steve, we're using

15:48.320 --> 15:50.440
a doctor at the hospital.

15:50.560 --> 15:52.640
You don't want to trust

15:50.560 --> 15:52.640
those quacks at the

15:52.760 --> 15:54.160
hospital, do you, Ken.

15:54.280 --> 15:56.800
I was kicked out of

15:54.280 --> 15:56.800
the hospital

15:54.280 --> 15:56.800
for alleged malpractice.

15:56.920 --> 15:59.200
They won't let me within

15:56.920 --> 15:59.200
20 yards of the place.

15:59.320 --> 16:01.680
That is how stupid hospitals

15:59.320 --> 16:01.680
are! So there we go.

16:01.800 --> 16:02.800
Let me have a look.

16:02.920 --> 16:04.160
-Um.

16:02.920 --> 16:04.160
-Ken.

16:05.680 --> 16:06.800
Thank you.

16:17.760 --> 16:19.120
Okay,

16:20.600 --> 16:23.360
In my professional opinion,

16:20.600 --> 16:23.360
that baby is due any day now!

16:23.480 --> 16:24.280
Am I right?

16:24.400 --> 16:25.280
It's a week late.

16:25.400 --> 16:26.280
It's a week late.

16:26.400 --> 16:27.920
We're getting

16:26.400 --> 16:27.920
quite anxious.

16:28.040 --> 16:29.480
Don't encourage him.

16:29.600 --> 16:32.160
You know,

16:29.600 --> 16:32.160
a while back now

16:33.240 --> 16:36.120
I rejected Western notions

16:33.240 --> 16:36.120
of medicine.

16:37.400 --> 16:39.880
Lorna, I have a trick

16:37.400 --> 16:39.880
to get that baby

16:40.000 --> 16:42.240
out of you like

16:40.000 --> 16:42.240
a rat from a trap.

16:42.360 --> 16:45.240
That's a very kind offer

16:42.360 --> 16:45.240
but it's a definite no.

16:45.360 --> 16:47.360
Ken! We've tried

16:45.360 --> 16:47.360
everything else!

16:47.480 --> 16:50.840
Does this method involve you

16:47.480 --> 16:50.840
touching me in any way?

16:50.960 --> 16:53.680
No. I mean I could.

16:53.800 --> 16:55.360
[both] No!

16:55.480 --> 16:56.560
No. Fine without...

17:04.240 --> 17:07.560
For me? Why,

17:04.240 --> 17:07.560
thank you.

17:07.680 --> 17:11.880
Point that to the sky like

17:07.680 --> 17:11.880
you're at Ginza or Karnak.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.200
It's your job to align

17:12.000 --> 17:15.200
the energy fields Ken.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.200
Align them.

17:27.240 --> 17:30.120
Okay, Lorna.

17:27.240 --> 17:30.120
Look at me.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.920
Hip. Si. Bin. Yah!

17:41.680 --> 17:43.200
Up.

17:43.320 --> 17:48.920
Si. Bin. Yah!

17:43.320 --> 17:48.920
Hip. Si. Bin. Yah!

17:49.040 --> 17:53.680
Hip. Si. Bin.

17:49.040 --> 17:53.680
[shouting]

18:03.160 --> 18:04.640
You blew

18:03.160 --> 18:04.640
my mind, Steve.

18:04.760 --> 18:07.080
Steve, you silly beggar,

18:04.760 --> 18:07.080
this lump...

18:08.920 --> 18:11.920
Oh my Jesus Christ!

18:12.040 --> 18:13.080
[water trickling]

18:13.200 --> 18:14.920
Ken, it's happening!

18:15.040 --> 18:16.720
Bloody hell!

18:15.040 --> 18:16.720
Where are my car keys?

18:16.840 --> 18:17.800
Where are my keys?

18:17.920 --> 18:19.080
They're in your jacket.

18:19.200 --> 18:20.720
Come on Ken,

18:19.200 --> 18:20.720
get a move on.

18:20.840 --> 18:22.960
Victory. Victory!

18:23.760 --> 18:25.800
Come on pick up.

18:25.920 --> 18:28.960
Ben, Ben, the baby's coming,

18:25.920 --> 18:28.960
Rachel's not picking up.

18:29.080 --> 18:30.920
Would you get her

18:29.080 --> 18:30.920
to the hospital?

18:31.040 --> 18:32.040
Ken! Ken! Hurry up!

18:32.160 --> 18:32.960
Thanks, mate.

18:35.200 --> 18:38.440
Be fair, Ken, let me finish

18:35.200 --> 18:38.440
the job. I'll deliver the baby.

18:38.560 --> 18:39.440
Steve...

18:39.560 --> 18:40.480
It'll be a freebie.

18:40.600 --> 18:41.720
Steve! Get out! Get out!

18:43.200 --> 18:45.000
I've been practicing

18:43.200 --> 18:45.000
at home.

18:45.120 --> 18:47.560
I've been practicing!

18:45.120 --> 18:47.560
Honestly it'd be fine.

18:47.680 --> 18:50.960
Call the baby Steve!

18:47.680 --> 18:50.960
Call it Steve!

18:51.680 --> 18:53.760
Rachel! Stop!

18:54.320 --> 18:55.320
Ben!

18:55.440 --> 18:59.200
Rachel! Stop it!

18:55.440 --> 18:59.200
Stop it immediately.

18:59.320 --> 19:01.520
Your mother's waters

18:59.320 --> 19:01.520
have broken. Come on!

19:01.640 --> 19:03.840
Stand up. Come on Dale.

19:01.640 --> 19:03.840
Wrap it up.

19:03.960 --> 19:06.240
Yeah, let's go now.

19:03.960 --> 19:06.240
Ben, can you give me a lift?

19:07.000 --> 19:09.080
I'll pay. I'll pay.

19:09.200 --> 19:10.280
Yeah, would take you

19:11.480 --> 19:12.360
but there's only space

19:11.480 --> 19:12.360
for one in the car.

19:14.080 --> 19:16.480
That's fine! It's

19:14.080 --> 19:16.480
under 12 miles right?

19:14.080 --> 19:16.480
I'll jog! Race ya!

19:19.080 --> 19:20.640
[moaning]

19:21.720 --> 19:23.360
Oh Mom!

19:21.720 --> 19:23.360
Everything all right?

19:25.440 --> 19:28.840
Phew, these suits

19:25.440 --> 19:28.840
were not made for

19:25.440 --> 19:28.840
long distance running!

19:28.960 --> 19:30.160
Did a baby come yet?

19:30.280 --> 19:32.200
No. You're all in

19:30.280 --> 19:32.200
plenty of time. Dylan!

19:32.320 --> 19:33.320
Dylan.

19:33.440 --> 19:34.760
You'd better ring him.

19:34.880 --> 19:37.240
No haven't got a signal.

19:34.880 --> 19:37.240
Be back in a minute love.

19:37.760 --> 19:39.440
Oooooh.

19:39.560 --> 19:44.200
Obey me, you bastard!

19:39.560 --> 19:44.200
Come on. Come on!

19:45.400 --> 19:46.720
Ken!

19:47.440 --> 19:49.640
You're here too!

19:49.760 --> 19:52.760
Looks like

19:49.760 --> 19:52.760
it's popping at last!

19:54.040 --> 19:55.480
So your wife's in too...

19:55.600 --> 19:58.200
Yeah. Looks like you're going

19:55.600 --> 19:58.200
to beat her to it though.

19:58.320 --> 19:59.520
Well done!

20:00.560 --> 20:02.320
Yes! I suppose

20:00.560 --> 20:02.320
I have a fast vagina!

20:06.160 --> 20:07.560
What's happening?

20:07.680 --> 20:10.480
What do you

20:07.680 --> 20:10.480
think's happening?

20:07.680 --> 20:10.480
Get a doctor!

20:10.600 --> 20:13.120
Doctor! We need

20:10.600 --> 20:13.120
a doctor!

20:13.840 --> 20:15.560
[groaning loudly]

20:23.760 --> 20:26.960
Oh my God,

20:23.760 --> 20:26.960
it's happening!

20:27.080 --> 20:28.640
Where's Ken? Get Ken!

20:28.760 --> 20:30.560
I'll find him, Lorna.

20:28.760 --> 20:30.560
I promise.

20:30.680 --> 20:31.520
Yes!

20:33.920 --> 20:36.280
Excuse me!

20:33.920 --> 20:36.280
Have you seen

20:33.920 --> 20:36.280
my giant friend?

20:36.400 --> 20:38.840
His face looks

20:36.400 --> 20:38.840
sort of like

20:36.400 --> 20:38.840
a really angry eagle.

20:39.520 --> 20:40.800
[screaming]

20:42.200 --> 20:43.400
One more push.

20:43.520 --> 20:45.240
Fuck you all!

20:45.360 --> 20:46.800
That's the spirit!

20:46.920 --> 20:49.680
Do you think someone

20:46.920 --> 20:49.680
could help

20:46.920 --> 20:49.680
me release this hand?

20:49.800 --> 20:51.520
Someone calm

20:49.800 --> 20:51.520
the father please.

20:51.640 --> 20:53.280
Thing is, I'm not

20:51.640 --> 20:53.280
the father.

20:53.400 --> 20:55.960
Will you just support me,

20:53.400 --> 20:55.960
you selfish bastard!

20:57.640 --> 20:59.920
Rachel, never

20:57.640 --> 20:59.920
have children.

21:01.280 --> 21:03.000
Where's your bloody dad?

21:07.640 --> 21:09.400
[screaming]

21:18.880 --> 21:20.560
[baby crying]

21:20.680 --> 21:24.760
It's a girl! Maybe Daddy

21:20.680 --> 21:24.760
would like to cut

21:20.680 --> 21:24.760
the umbilical cord?

21:24.880 --> 21:26.600
See you later.

21:41.760 --> 21:47.160
What! Damn you!

21:41.760 --> 21:47.160
Give me the chocolate.

21:52.200 --> 21:56.160
No! No! No!

22:03.320 --> 22:05.840
Lorna.

22:09.560 --> 22:11.800
He's like a bear,

22:09.560 --> 22:11.800
he's like a big bear

22:11.920 --> 22:13.520
Lorna!

22:16.360 --> 22:18.160
Okay. Chief Ken!

22:16.360 --> 22:18.160
Sorry sir!

22:22.440 --> 22:23.800
Ken! Ken!

22:23.920 --> 22:27.000
Have you seen a really huge

22:23.920 --> 22:27.000
man? He calls himself

22:27.120 --> 22:28.160
Chief Ken.

22:36.720 --> 22:43.200
Shit! Come on. 1111.

22:36.720 --> 22:43.200
Oh thank God!

22:43.320 --> 22:45.120
Please I need to

22:43.320 --> 22:45.120
get to my wife!

22:45.240 --> 22:46.960
-Of course!

22:45.240 --> 22:46.960
You're Ken, right?

22:45.240 --> 22:46.960
-Yes.

22:47.080 --> 22:48.560
I'll take you to her.

22:48.680 --> 22:49.800
Thank you!

22:55.840 --> 22:58.320
Ken! You came back!

22:58.440 --> 23:02.720
No! Not you!

22:58.440 --> 23:02.720
Not bloody you!

23:08.040 --> 23:09.320
Sorry.

23:13.000 --> 23:13.800
Lorna!

23:14.560 --> 23:16.480
Ken? Where were you?

23:17.440 --> 23:19.760
Bad phone reception.

23:19.880 --> 23:22.360
Chief Ken! I was looking

23:19.880 --> 23:22.360
everywhere for you.

23:22.480 --> 23:24.080
Ken, I can't believe you--

23:24.200 --> 23:28.200
Shhh! Can we please just

23:24.200 --> 23:28.200
enjoy the moment?

23:28.320 --> 23:34.120
Here, hold your son.

23:28.320 --> 23:34.120
Have you got him?

23:37.840 --> 23:40.440
Oh Dad, magic touch.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.280
Wow!

23:50.760 --> 23:53.720
I'll do it. I'll take

23:50.760 --> 23:53.720
the paternity leave.

23:53.840 --> 23:57.280
Stuff work. It's my turn.

23:57.400 --> 24:00.200
Glad you've come

23:57.400 --> 24:00.200
to your senses!

24:00.320 --> 24:03.120
Here, pass him over,

24:00.320 --> 24:03.120
greedy guts.

24:10.960 --> 24:15.880
Number three, eh?

24:10.960 --> 24:15.880
At last. I have a son!

24:16.000 --> 24:18.240
Dad, what about Dylan?

24:18.360 --> 24:20.800
Oh yeah, Dylan.

24:26.520 --> 24:29.600
Here you go, and if there's

24:26.520 --> 24:29.600
anything else you want,

24:29.720 --> 24:30.600
just ask.

24:30.720 --> 24:33.040
Wow, I feel

24:30.720 --> 24:33.040
like a princess.

24:33.160 --> 24:36.720
And all I had to do was push

24:33.160 --> 24:36.720
a ginormous baby out my lulu.

24:40.280 --> 24:41.640
Sid's a great name.

24:42.640 --> 24:45.440
Sidney Poitier.

24:42.640 --> 24:45.440
Sidney James.

24:45.560 --> 24:48.720
Sidney Vicious.

24:45.560 --> 24:48.720
There are

24:45.560 --> 24:48.720
no bad Sids.

24:50.720 --> 24:52.000
What?

24:52.120 --> 24:55.240
Just thinking. By the time

24:52.120 --> 24:55.240
Sid's 18, you'll be 65.

24:55.360 --> 24:57.840
About to retire, starting

24:55.360 --> 24:57.840
to forget things.

24:57.960 --> 25:00.040
If your heart hasn't

24:57.960 --> 25:00.040
packed in by then.

25:00.160 --> 25:02.080
Good night, Lorna.

25:02.200 --> 25:03.960
Good night, Siddles.

25:08.360 --> 25:09.720
Primary carer.

25:09.840 --> 25:11.000
I'll start tomorrow.

25:11.120 --> 25:12.240
