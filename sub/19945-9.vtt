WEBVTT

00:47.631 --> 00:48.715
Uh-huh.

00:49.341 --> 00:52.427
Well, let me run it past
my business partner

00:52.511 --> 00:54.513
and I'll get back to you. Okay?

00:55.138 --> 00:56.390
Thanks.

00:57.516 --> 01:00.185
God, how does this happen?

01:00.269 --> 01:02.312
I've only been on the phone five minutes.

01:02.396 --> 01:03.689
And in that five minutes,

01:03.772 --> 01:07.985
I emptied the contents in our refrigerator
onto our kitchen island.

01:08.068 --> 01:11.280
-Dare I ask why?
-I'm making dinner for Jacob.

01:11.363 --> 01:14.199
He always cooks for me
so I'm flipping the script.

01:14.783 --> 01:16.368
Doesn't look like there is a script.

01:16.451 --> 01:17.995
I'm freestyling, lady.

01:18.078 --> 01:21.164
I let the ingredients speak to me.

01:21.248 --> 01:24.835
I cook the way I paint,
with intense sexual rage.

01:24.918 --> 01:28.880
Well, while you were in here
talking to food or whatever,

01:28.964 --> 01:32.050
-I got a new bid on our vibrators.
-And?

01:32.134 --> 01:33.969
It's gonna cost us 30 percent more,

01:34.052 --> 01:36.930
but they'll deliver
by the end of the month.

01:37.014 --> 01:38.473
So what do we do?

01:38.557 --> 01:41.893
Well, the guy on the phone
was kind of flirty, so I want to--

01:41.977 --> 01:44.396
-Send him a tasteful nude?
-No.

01:44.479 --> 01:47.983
I'm going to tell him we're talking
to a cheaper manufacturer in Malaysia.

01:48.066 --> 01:49.818
And then, bam,
that's when we hit him with the nudie.

01:49.901 --> 01:51.278
No nudies.

01:51.361 --> 01:53.155
I was kidding.

01:53.238 --> 01:57.242
The real plan is we accidentally
conference in the Malaysians.

01:57.326 --> 02:00.746
I could probably learn that accent
in 15 minutes.

02:00.829 --> 02:03.832
Frankie, when has one of your accents
ever worked for us?

02:03.915 --> 02:05.459
Only every time, man.

02:05.542 --> 02:08.170
Now you be leaving, I and I be cooking.

02:09.504 --> 02:11.465
You can handle it, man.

02:14.092 --> 02:16.511
So, which do you want to plant first:

02:16.595 --> 02:18.555
an impish "Jersey Devil"...

02:19.723 --> 02:21.975
a jaunty "Mr. Stripey"

02:22.059 --> 02:25.604
or an aptly-named "Monkey Ass"?

02:25.687 --> 02:29.816
Sorry. I had to do something
to make gardening fun.

02:30.150 --> 02:32.152
-You pick.
-No, no. It's your honor.

02:32.235 --> 02:35.739
This is the first Friday where
you haven't accidentally put your suit on.

02:35.822 --> 02:40.160
I'm happy being retired. I don't get
those stress headaches anymore.

02:40.243 --> 02:45.165
Of course, now they're replaced
with boredom headaches.

02:49.753 --> 02:51.046
Hello, Lydia.

02:51.129 --> 02:52.672
You can tell your sister right now

02:52.756 --> 02:55.759
that we're not going to their house
on Lake Michigan this year.

02:57.052 --> 02:58.011
Oh?

02:59.763 --> 03:00.722
Sure.

03:01.515 --> 03:02.724
Okay.

03:02.808 --> 03:04.559
I'll call you later. Bye.

03:04.643 --> 03:07.104
I'm sorry, I can't sleep
in those bunk beds again.

03:07.854 --> 03:10.816
And it's mayonnaise salad
after mayonnaise salad.

03:10.899 --> 03:13.068
Don't worry,
we're not going to Lake Michigan.

03:13.151 --> 03:15.612
-So why did she call?
-Oh...

03:15.695 --> 03:19.366
She just wanted to let me know that Mother
passed away in her sleep last night.

03:19.449 --> 03:21.785
You know, this really does
look like a monkey's ass.

03:28.750 --> 03:30.419
You're bringing a bathing suit?

03:30.502 --> 03:33.630
The place we're staying at
doesn't have a pool, does it?

03:33.713 --> 03:35.882
It doesn't,
but it's across the street from the beach.

03:35.966 --> 03:38.427
-Oh, right.
-Do you not want to go to the beach?

03:38.510 --> 03:41.555
If you want to go, I am happy to go.

03:41.638 --> 03:42.806
Decide when we get there?

03:44.808 --> 03:45.934
Okay.

03:48.186 --> 03:49.980
-Tennis racket?
-Yeah.

03:50.063 --> 03:53.191
I figure we can hit some balls around
while we're up there.

03:55.819 --> 03:57.070
We don't have to.

03:58.113 --> 03:59.322
But if you want to...

04:00.073 --> 04:01.575
Decide when we get there?

04:02.617 --> 04:04.661
-Okay.
-Okay.

04:08.081 --> 04:10.041
-Hey.
-Hey. So, Dad called.

04:10.125 --> 04:11.334
Grandma died.

04:15.088 --> 04:16.673
-Hello?
<i>-Yeah, I'm here.</i>

04:17.340 --> 04:19.468
Oh, my God, I feel terrible.

04:19.551 --> 04:21.094
-Really?
<i>-Yeah.</i>

04:21.178 --> 04:23.555
I totally forgot she was still alive.

04:23.638 --> 04:25.056
I know, right?

04:25.849 --> 04:29.186
So, I'm gonna go over to Dad and Sol's
and help with some funeral stuff.

04:29.269 --> 04:32.105
-Okay. What time?
-Not telling you. I've got this covered.

04:32.189 --> 04:33.106
<i>No, I want to help.</i>

04:33.190 --> 04:36.151
No. You're not gonna ruin
your weekend with Mitch because of this.

04:36.234 --> 04:37.444
-But it--
<i>-No.</i>

04:37.527 --> 04:40.697
You will be back in time for the service.
Do not cancel your trip.

04:41.990 --> 04:44.034
You're right. Of course.

04:44.117 --> 04:45.911
Okay. Bye.

04:50.791 --> 04:52.042
We have to cancel our trip.

04:54.419 --> 04:56.046
-Hey.
-Hey!

04:57.339 --> 05:00.050
Pots are not supposed to melt, right?

05:00.133 --> 05:01.384
No.

05:01.468 --> 05:04.596
So, that this happened is weird, right?

05:04.679 --> 05:07.682
-It's impossible. Congratulations.
-Huh.

05:12.771 --> 05:14.815
Those don't look like Veggies by Jake.

05:14.898 --> 05:19.402
No, the grocery store. Sometimes it's nice
not to have to work so hard for a carrot.

05:19.486 --> 05:20.946
Tough day on the farm?

05:21.029 --> 05:23.740
Every day is a tough day
when you're running a farm.

05:24.115 --> 05:26.117
5:00 a.m. comes earlier every morning.

05:27.160 --> 05:28.870
There's a 5:00 a.m.?

05:29.788 --> 05:31.414
I'm kidding, I've heard of it.

05:32.415 --> 05:33.500
What happened?

05:33.583 --> 05:35.460
I have a cricket infestation
I have to take care of.

05:35.544 --> 05:37.796
No, no, you cannot kill crickets.

05:37.879 --> 05:41.049
They're Mother Earth's tiny musicians.

05:41.132 --> 05:44.344
You know 30 percent of owning a farm
is killing stuff, right?

05:44.427 --> 05:49.057
You know that 90 percent of dating
a farmer is denying that 30 percent?

05:49.140 --> 05:52.102
Sit and relax. You've had a hard day.

05:52.185 --> 05:56.273
-Thank you. So will Grace be joining us?
-Oh.

05:56.356 --> 06:00.443
No, Grace went over to Robert's.
His mother died.

06:00.527 --> 06:03.280
Aww. He's lucky to have had her this long.

06:04.281 --> 06:08.618
Well, the misery of others sustained her.

06:14.165 --> 06:16.459
Someone is supposed to be
sitting in their seat.

06:16.543 --> 06:17.836
Someone just loves to help.

06:17.919 --> 06:20.922
Someone says thank you...

06:21.381 --> 06:23.842
but she doesn't need any help.

06:31.057 --> 06:32.892
That's not where that goes.

06:32.976 --> 06:34.352
Stop helping.

06:35.562 --> 06:36.896
What do you have so far?

06:36.980 --> 06:41.610
Okay. Here goes...
"Say what you want about Barbara Hanson,

06:41.693 --> 06:44.904
but she always really hated
Mexican people."

06:44.988 --> 06:46.197
Brianna!

06:46.281 --> 06:48.450
Honestly, how do I write nice things

06:48.533 --> 06:51.202
about a woman who volunteered
with the mentally disabled

06:51.286 --> 06:53.371
because they're "easy to beat at cards"?

06:53.455 --> 06:55.790
We could say she "gave of herself."

06:55.874 --> 06:58.585
Oh, okay. I can do that.

06:58.668 --> 07:01.254
And what's another term for...

07:01.338 --> 07:03.465
if, like, a dry heave were a person?

07:03.548 --> 07:05.008
Stoic.

07:05.091 --> 07:07.260
"She kept a silent, cold house

07:07.344 --> 07:10.931
and slowly whittled my grandfather
down to a nub"?

07:11.014 --> 07:12.432
Um...

07:12.515 --> 07:15.769
"Proud<i> Reader's Digest</i> subscriber"?

07:15.852 --> 07:17.938
"She confidently sported a mustache"?

07:18.647 --> 07:21.024
She was stately.

07:21.441 --> 07:22.776
Grace.

07:22.859 --> 07:24.069
Hi, Mom.

07:24.152 --> 07:26.237
I brought you some food and...

07:26.988 --> 07:29.616
-some stuff Frankie made.
-Mmm.

07:29.699 --> 07:31.368
Where's Robert?

07:31.451 --> 07:33.411
-He's in the bedroom.
-How is he?

07:33.495 --> 07:38.750
Well, I think he's a little lost right now
as to how he should be feeling.

07:38.833 --> 07:42.545
Sometimes it's even more difficult
to process a complicated relationship

07:42.629 --> 07:46.633
like the one he had with his mother,
but it still has to be painful.

07:48.677 --> 07:51.304
So many emotions, really.

07:51.388 --> 07:53.890
Also, when the second parent dies,

07:53.974 --> 07:57.102
all of a sudden,
your safety net is removed.

07:57.185 --> 08:00.480
I think he's feeling vulnerable,
but he's...

08:03.483 --> 08:05.902
Oh, she left around the word "emotions."

08:06.820 --> 08:07.988
Oh.

08:20.083 --> 08:22.168
Oh, you should go with the housecoat.

08:22.252 --> 08:23.962
Show off your calf muscles.

08:24.045 --> 08:26.631
They're my mother's-- were my mother's.

08:26.715 --> 08:28.550
I recognize them.

08:28.633 --> 08:30.802
I'm so sorry, Robert.

08:30.885 --> 08:32.262
Yeah, she was a wonderful...

08:34.806 --> 08:36.182
bridge player.

08:36.933 --> 08:41.604
Well, what do you think that wonderful
bridge player would like to be buried in?

08:41.688 --> 08:43.523
A smart, white suit.

08:43.606 --> 08:45.108
How do you know that?

08:45.191 --> 08:46.735
Oh, she told me once.

08:46.818 --> 08:48.611
Nicest thing she ever said to me.

08:49.821 --> 08:52.532
These are neither smart
nor white nor suits.

08:53.158 --> 08:55.285
This is a nightgown.

08:55.368 --> 08:56.953
And in no way flattering.

08:58.121 --> 09:01.374
How about I take you shopping?
We could get something for her.

09:02.292 --> 09:03.668
You would do that?

09:03.752 --> 09:07.172
Well, you did come over
and pick me up off the floor.

09:07.255 --> 09:08.965
I owe you.

09:09.049 --> 09:10.967
-We're keeping score?
-Oh, yeah.

09:11.843 --> 09:14.137
Hey. You okay?

09:14.220 --> 09:15.722
I'm fine, Sol.

09:16.473 --> 09:19.100
Oh, her clothes.

09:19.726 --> 09:21.770
I remember when my mother passed,

09:21.853 --> 09:24.105
going through her closet.

09:25.940 --> 09:30.820
Her perfume on her clothes
brought back so many memories.

09:33.948 --> 09:36.242
Her shoes, particularly.

09:36.326 --> 09:38.828
The ones she wore in the garden.

09:39.913 --> 09:42.499
The ones she wore to temple.

09:47.045 --> 09:48.213
Mom.

09:51.883 --> 09:55.553
What are you gonna say to Grace when she
asks what happened to the kitchen floor?

09:55.637 --> 09:58.264
I'm gonna tell her
not to look at the ceiling.

09:59.724 --> 10:02.060
Well, shall we? Uh, it's a buffet.

10:02.143 --> 10:05.522
I based it on one that I love
at Caesar's Palace.

10:05.605 --> 10:06.606
After you.

10:10.443 --> 10:12.445
What happened there?

10:13.071 --> 10:14.823
I walked into my goat.

10:14.906 --> 10:17.575
Oh, poor old Carol Anne.

10:17.659 --> 10:19.619
Poor old Jacob.

10:19.702 --> 10:22.205
There's a reason you don't see
a lot of old farmers.

10:22.288 --> 10:25.375
Oh, what about "Old MacDonald"?
He had a farm.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.252
Have you ever seen Old MacDonald?

10:27.335 --> 10:29.504
You know what? I haven't.

10:29.587 --> 10:32.257
I don't have a clear picture
in my head at all.

10:32.340 --> 10:34.425
I rest my case.

10:34.509 --> 10:36.553
But you love that farm.

10:37.220 --> 10:40.390
I loved it when I was 50.
But now that my body's 70...

10:41.391 --> 10:43.810
it doesn't matter how much I love it.
I am tired.

10:43.893 --> 10:45.186
Really?

10:45.979 --> 10:46.813
Really.

10:47.564 --> 10:48.982
But what would you do next?

10:49.065 --> 10:53.278
And don't say "cookie dough taster"
because that's my chapter two.

10:53.987 --> 10:55.405
Well, actually...

10:56.364 --> 10:57.365
I...

10:58.116 --> 11:00.910
...kind of have a plan in place.

11:00.994 --> 11:03.413
-You do?
-Yes.

11:03.496 --> 11:06.583
Remember that trip I took to Santa Fe
to see my kids?

11:06.666 --> 11:07.792
Yeah.

11:07.876 --> 11:11.087
I also went there to see
a little adobe that I own.

11:11.713 --> 11:13.381
You own a house in Santa Fe?

11:13.464 --> 11:14.757
Yeah.

11:14.841 --> 11:18.094
I bought it when my oldest moved there
about 12 years ago.

11:18.177 --> 11:19.888
I've been renting it out.

11:20.722 --> 11:22.557
But you aren't anymore?

11:22.640 --> 11:26.436
-No. Not anymore.
-Why not?

11:27.061 --> 11:30.982
Because... I might need it.

11:33.318 --> 11:36.237
Because you're--
You might move to Santa Fe?

11:38.740 --> 11:40.366
At some point.

11:41.034 --> 11:42.577
When is "some point"?

11:42.660 --> 11:44.203
When the time comes.

11:44.287 --> 11:46.539
Sounds like the time's coming.

11:47.415 --> 11:49.709
When did you plan to tell me all this?

11:49.792 --> 11:52.879
I don't know.
We never talk much about the future.

11:52.962 --> 11:57.091
I mean, well, we talk a lot
about the future, like...

11:57.592 --> 12:02.430
artificial intelligence
or if you'll be jealous of your clone.

12:02.513 --> 12:05.516
She'd be jealous of me!

12:05.600 --> 12:07.018
I didn't mean to get you upset.

12:07.101 --> 12:12.357
I'm not upset. I'm just listening to you
talk about your farm and your Santa Fe.

12:12.440 --> 12:15.276
I'm sure it's beautiful there.

12:17.320 --> 12:20.823
Why am I clearing these plates?
I haven't even started my dinner.

12:29.374 --> 12:31.584
I can't believe you stole
Dad's good Scotch.

12:31.668 --> 12:33.962
I'm pouring one out for my dead homie.

12:35.046 --> 12:37.298
To Grandma. She was...

12:39.384 --> 12:40.885
related to us.

12:41.594 --> 12:44.472
Yes, I'm positive she's dead.

12:47.058 --> 12:49.936
Well, no, I didn't actually see the body,

12:50.019 --> 12:53.439
but it's true,
I can't technically prove it.

12:53.523 --> 12:56.693
Wow, people seem really devastated.

12:56.776 --> 12:58.695
Let's just find a good picture of her.

12:58.778 --> 13:02.365
Yeah, but let's take our time though,
'cause, you know, Scotch.

13:02.448 --> 13:05.618
Uh-huh. That's true, but still...

13:05.702 --> 13:08.287
There's that million dollar smile.

13:12.208 --> 13:14.002
Were her lips sewn shut?

13:14.085 --> 13:16.921
No, look, here's one of her screaming.

13:17.005 --> 13:19.382
Ooh, do you remember this?
That was the day that she told you

13:19.465 --> 13:22.343
you were going to hell for living
with Mitch before you were married.

13:22.427 --> 13:24.345
Still my favorite part of my wedding day.

13:24.429 --> 13:28.891
And yet you'd rather be here doing this
instead of on vacation with your husband.

13:28.975 --> 13:30.309
Family comes first.

13:31.394 --> 13:32.645
Try again.

13:33.187 --> 13:34.188
Okay, you got me.

13:34.272 --> 13:37.567
I didn't want you giving me shit
for leaving you alone to deal with this.

13:37.650 --> 13:40.987
Oh, I'll find another reason to give
you shit and I'm still not buying it.

13:41.070 --> 13:42.739
Well, that's all I'm selling.

13:42.822 --> 13:45.283
Bullshit. Why aren't you off
getting pool-drunk at your nice hotel?

13:45.366 --> 13:46.451
-Because.
-Because why?

13:50.663 --> 13:52.540
Because I didn't want
to go away with Mitch.

13:52.623 --> 13:55.126
Ah-ha! Gotcha!

13:57.712 --> 14:00.256
- Oh, shit.
- No!

14:00.339 --> 14:04.719
She died of natural causes.
Nobody killed her.

14:06.095 --> 14:07.972
Yes, I'm sure.

14:08.890 --> 14:10.266
Pretty sure.

14:15.146 --> 14:18.232
Feel free not to talk to me
about your feelings.

14:18.316 --> 14:21.527
I've missed
our passive-aggressive silences.

14:22.320 --> 14:25.865
Oh, how about something like this?
Only all white.

14:25.948 --> 14:28.159
That's how she liked
her neighborhood, too.

14:29.118 --> 14:32.705
Is she the same size she used to be?
Last time you saw her how'd she look?

14:32.789 --> 14:35.875
Angry. It was not a great visit.

14:36.626 --> 14:38.669
Well, why should this time
be any different?

14:38.753 --> 14:40.755
Because I told her I was gay.

14:40.838 --> 14:43.466
Oh, my God, you did?

14:44.050 --> 14:45.176
How did that go?

14:45.259 --> 14:48.888
Well, we are shopping
for her burial clothes, you tell me.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.642
So, how about something like this?

14:52.725 --> 14:54.102
No.

14:54.685 --> 14:57.563
Oh, wait a minute. This is more like it.

14:58.314 --> 15:00.233
But I'd need to see it on somebody.

15:00.316 --> 15:05.154
We need a stern battle-axe
with a map of Ireland on her face.

15:09.450 --> 15:12.745
I believe the woman you're looking for
is right over there.

15:17.583 --> 15:22.088
Look, I don't know a lot about marriage,
but I do read a lot of <i>Family Circus</i>,

15:22.171 --> 15:25.842
and from what I understand,
a lot of this is normal.

15:25.925 --> 15:28.344
Nothing feels normal at my house anymore.

15:28.428 --> 15:31.556
See, that's the whole point of vacation,
hotels make things better.

15:31.639 --> 15:35.143
I don't think a piña colada
and room service are gonna do it.

15:35.893 --> 15:37.645
Oh, wow, that's dark.

15:39.689 --> 15:42.608
I mean, have you and Mitch
tried couples counseling?

15:43.192 --> 15:45.153
We're in counseling.

15:45.236 --> 15:46.737
This is us in counseling.

15:46.821 --> 15:49.115
Wow. What are you going to do?

15:49.198 --> 15:53.494
I'm not gonna break up my family.
I have four kids.

15:53.578 --> 15:57.748
Well... I mean,
I'm not a huge fan of children in general,

15:57.832 --> 16:02.128
but I, myself, was a child
and I remember what it felt like

16:02.211 --> 16:04.505
growing up in a house
with unhappy parents.

16:04.589 --> 16:05.631
I do, too.

16:05.715 --> 16:07.675
You don't want to do that to your kids.

16:07.758 --> 16:09.719
I know. I don't.

16:11.053 --> 16:13.890
It just doesn't feel like
I have a lot of options.

16:13.973 --> 16:16.893
If the kids were not in the picture,
what would you do?

16:19.729 --> 16:22.982
I mean, don't you deserve to be
with someone who makes you happy?

16:23.065 --> 16:26.319
I'd settle for someone
who wants to be in the same room as me.

16:26.402 --> 16:29.614
No, wrong. You need someone
who wants to be with you all the time.

16:29.697 --> 16:32.366
Who loves you even when you hate yourself.

16:32.450 --> 16:37.288
And no matter where you go or what you do,
he still wants to be with you.

16:37.371 --> 16:41.083
I think that guy's... an urban legend.

16:42.585 --> 16:44.545
Oh, my God.

16:46.547 --> 16:48.883
I used to date an urban legend.

16:50.384 --> 16:52.762
I never even knew Winston's had dresses.

16:52.845 --> 16:56.766
Well, that's because you were so busy
munching popovers up on the third floor.

16:56.849 --> 16:59.977
They're always fresh and
they serve them with strawberry butter.

17:00.061 --> 17:02.146
Where is it your mother is going?

17:04.440 --> 17:06.317
She's going far away.

17:06.400 --> 17:08.528
It's gonna be hot there.

17:08.611 --> 17:10.821
Well, this might not work then.

17:10.905 --> 17:12.532
The fabric is a bit heavy.

17:12.615 --> 17:14.534
Oh, that's okay. She runs cold.

17:14.617 --> 17:18.371
What I mean is
it doesn't breathe very well.

17:18.454 --> 17:19.372
Nor does she.

17:19.455 --> 17:23.459
It's tight a bit when I do... this.

17:23.543 --> 17:27.630
-She won't be doing that.
-She mostly keeps her arms at her sides.

17:27.713 --> 17:28.839
Or across her chest.

17:28.923 --> 17:30.967
Oh, it's a good suit for her.

17:31.050 --> 17:34.554
Could you... hunch over and glower?

17:34.637 --> 17:37.139
Or could you possibly
overcook some string beans?

17:37.223 --> 17:39.350
I'm not sure I understand.

17:40.309 --> 17:42.687
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It's good. We'll take it.

17:45.064 --> 17:48.109
We're so bad. Oh, God, we're awful.

17:48.192 --> 17:51.028
We're so, so bad. Oh, God.

17:51.862 --> 17:53.614
Oh, God.

17:54.907 --> 17:56.826
Oh, God.

17:57.702 --> 18:01.038
Oh, Robert. I'm so sorry.
We shouldn't be laughing.

18:01.706 --> 18:02.915
No...

18:04.041 --> 18:06.168
it's not just the dying.

18:07.295 --> 18:08.754
I think--

18:08.838 --> 18:09.922
I mean, I know...

18:10.006 --> 18:13.175
I'm sorry... I can't... What?

18:13.259 --> 18:14.760
You're being so nice to me.

18:14.844 --> 18:18.848
Do you not want me to be?
Because this is a lot of work.

18:18.931 --> 18:23.144
I'm sorry because I know how it feels...

18:23.978 --> 18:26.689
not to be loved by someone
who should love you.

18:27.189 --> 18:32.820
And I know how terrible it must have felt
for you all those years.

18:32.903 --> 18:37.033
And I am so, so very sorry.

18:39.452 --> 18:41.203
Thank you for telling me.

18:43.914 --> 18:45.207
Oh.

18:47.960 --> 18:50.880
Uh, I'm sorry, can I come out now?

18:52.548 --> 18:54.216
Oh, jeez.

19:01.015 --> 19:02.141
Boo!

19:02.224 --> 19:03.434
Boo yourself.

19:04.477 --> 19:06.646
I heard your truck door slam.

19:07.772 --> 19:09.190
Uh-huh.

19:09.273 --> 19:10.650
What's this?

19:10.733 --> 19:14.779
<i>Untitled Poodle With Additional Poodles.</i>

19:14.862 --> 19:16.113
I like it.

19:17.865 --> 19:19.992
-Are those for me?
-Yes.

19:20.076 --> 19:22.745
I call them
"flower and additional flowers."

19:23.621 --> 19:25.706
Well, you're wasting your money

19:25.790 --> 19:29.794
because I steal my flowers
from Grace's bedroom.

19:33.089 --> 19:34.465
But thank you.

19:35.257 --> 19:36.509
Frankie...

19:38.260 --> 19:40.012
I'm sorry about last night.

19:40.096 --> 19:41.472
No, I'm sorry.

19:41.555 --> 19:46.435
It just threw me that you
already had this whole plan in place.

19:46.519 --> 19:48.479
Well, I didn't want to assume

19:48.562 --> 19:52.858
that we're at the point
where my future plans would affect you.

19:54.318 --> 19:55.611
Well, we are...

19:56.362 --> 19:57.363
and they do.

19:58.698 --> 20:01.450
So, what if,

20:01.534 --> 20:03.994
when the time comes, you come with me?

20:04.787 --> 20:05.996
To Santa Fe?

20:06.080 --> 20:08.541
Yes, you'd love it there.

20:08.624 --> 20:11.627
It's an artist community.
Deeply spiritual.

20:11.711 --> 20:15.423
And we'd only be an hour away
from Albuquerque, which, as you know, is--

20:15.506 --> 20:17.967
Is the hot air balloon capital
of the world.

20:18.050 --> 20:20.261
Jacob, don't do this to me.

20:20.886 --> 20:21.971
Why?

20:22.555 --> 20:26.016
You'd love it there.
That town... was made for you.

20:26.517 --> 20:28.894
I don't know. My life is here.

20:28.978 --> 20:31.939
I have kids and a business and a Grace.

20:32.022 --> 20:33.733
She won't survive without me.

20:33.816 --> 20:36.944
I'm the glue that holds
that vintage Barbie together.

20:37.027 --> 20:38.821
What else do you see for yourself?

20:40.740 --> 20:41.991
I don't know. I...

20:42.575 --> 20:45.369
I had these plans
when I was married to Sol.

20:45.453 --> 20:46.996
I never replaced them,

20:47.079 --> 20:51.584
except I'd enjoy having
grandchildren one day.

20:51.667 --> 20:53.627
I want to keep making art.

20:53.711 --> 20:55.588
And have I mentioned Grace?

20:58.048 --> 20:59.675
I have to ask...

21:00.551 --> 21:05.639
Do you really see yourself living here
with Grace for the rest of your life?

21:09.602 --> 21:12.396
Look, there's no pressure.

21:12.480 --> 21:16.317
We're not making any decisions today.
We're not making any decisions tomorrow.

21:17.818 --> 21:20.905
So, you mean, like... Wednesday?

21:22.990 --> 21:26.452
Take all the time you need. Okay?

21:32.416 --> 21:34.835
- Hey.
- Hey.

21:35.586 --> 21:37.004
How's your dad?

21:37.087 --> 21:38.088
Good.

21:38.756 --> 21:42.176
-Good. You know.
-Yeah, I do.

21:43.135 --> 21:44.428
When's the funeral?

21:44.512 --> 21:46.138
Uh, it's Sunday.

21:46.222 --> 21:47.223
Oh.

21:49.350 --> 21:52.561
We could still go up to Santa Barbara
for a couple days if you want to.

21:53.687 --> 21:55.397
Do you want to?

21:56.857 --> 21:58.234
Well, if you want to.

21:59.485 --> 22:02.446
Oh, my God, do you want to go or not?
Look, just tell me.

22:03.614 --> 22:08.202
-I'm saying if you still wanted to go--
-You're not saying anything.

22:08.285 --> 22:11.330
Haven't you realized that when we talk
we don't say anything?

22:12.456 --> 22:15.042
Do you want to do that for two days?

22:15.125 --> 22:17.920
Is that something
that you're looking forward to?

22:18.003 --> 22:19.964
Because I'm not.

22:22.508 --> 22:25.386
I was actually relieved
when we decided not to go.

22:28.973 --> 22:30.140
Wow.

22:33.060 --> 22:34.436
Okay.

22:37.690 --> 22:38.858
Me, too.

22:46.073 --> 22:50.494
Hey, I'm so sorry to bother you with
something as invasive as a phone call.

22:50.578 --> 22:52.329
I know this is, um...

22:53.330 --> 22:54.415
I...

22:54.498 --> 22:57.543
I'd have wanted--
I just wanted to touch base and--

22:57.626 --> 22:59.044
How is Baltimore?

22:59.837 --> 23:01.130
It's okay.

23:04.466 --> 23:05.801
This is weird, right?

23:05.885 --> 23:07.303
Yeah.

23:07.928 --> 23:09.179
<i>So...</i>

23:11.682 --> 23:12.808
can I come and see you?

23:12.891 --> 23:14.351
<i>I, um...</i>

23:15.561 --> 23:17.021
Uh...

23:18.480 --> 23:19.565
Yeah.

23:20.816 --> 23:22.651
Okay. Yes.

23:26.280 --> 23:27.656
It's good to hear your voice.

23:28.907 --> 23:30.492
Yeah, you too.

23:35.080 --> 23:36.707
Will you need a box?

23:36.790 --> 23:38.709
-No, thanks. We have one.
-Yes.

23:38.792 --> 23:41.045
A rather large rectangular one.

23:41.128 --> 23:43.047
Yeah, I get it, she's dead.

23:43.672 --> 23:46.091
You're a good sport. What's your name?

23:46.175 --> 23:48.552
Maureen. I'm sorry for your loss.

23:48.636 --> 23:49.762
Thank you.

23:51.347 --> 23:54.475
Look how beautiful this is.
Shall we put it on her?

23:54.558 --> 23:56.935
-She'd hate it.
-Oh, she would.

23:57.019 --> 23:58.020
Yeah.

23:58.729 --> 24:00.481
It is beautiful.

24:02.232 --> 24:03.901
How about if I buy it for you?

24:04.610 --> 24:09.365
Robert, are you actually
buying me a present in the moment

24:09.448 --> 24:10.991
because you're thinking about me?

24:11.075 --> 24:12.201
I think I am.

24:12.284 --> 24:14.662
-Oh, thank you.
-You're welcome.

24:14.745 --> 24:17.289
How about I take you up to the third floor

24:17.373 --> 24:20.292
and get you one of those popovers
with strawberry butter?

24:20.376 --> 24:22.628
I've been waiting for you
to say that all day.

24:22.711 --> 24:25.130
Please add this.
We'll be right back, Margaret.

24:25.714 --> 24:27.716
-Maureen.
-Sorry.

24:46.402 --> 24:48.278
Cute scarf.

24:49.071 --> 24:51.115
Robert bought it for me.

24:51.198 --> 24:53.742
Sounds like death
brings out the best in him.

24:55.202 --> 24:56.662
I guess it does.

24:58.414 --> 25:00.457
You gonna bogart that thing?

25:03.669 --> 25:05.921
Brianna taught me some pot words.

25:10.634 --> 25:14.638
You know, I actually enjoyed
spending time with Robert today.

25:16.432 --> 25:18.475
I thought you had plans
to hate him forever.

25:20.102 --> 25:21.854
Plans can change.

25:24.523 --> 25:25.941
They really can.

25:28.777 --> 25:30.279
What are you thinking about?

25:32.990 --> 25:34.575
Balloons.

25:36.660 --> 25:39.788
It's never a straight line with you,
is it?

25:43.083 --> 25:43.917
Yeah.

26:40.766 --> 26:42.101
<i>Okay, good night.</i>
