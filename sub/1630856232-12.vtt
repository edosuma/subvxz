18:27.941 --> 18:29.734
the whole performance
went to another place.

18:29.776 --> 18:31.194
Yeah, yeah, definitely.
But that's okay,

18:31.236 --> 18:32.362
because you already
got two turns

18:32.404 --> 18:33.905
and you're here
to be coached.

18:33.947 --> 18:36.908
I love that Gwen was able
to recognize that and say,

18:36.950 --> 18:38.993
"We can work on that."
She can coach nerves.

18:39.035 --> 18:42.122
Be a little bit more intentional
with, like, the lyrics.

18:42.163 --> 18:44.666
Step away from, like, the
technical side of singing it.

18:44.708 --> 18:47.252
I'm not really as experienced,
I guess, on stage.

18:47.293 --> 18:49.879
Obviously, everyone's
better when they're
alone in their room.

18:49.921 --> 18:51.548
I still get nervous,
especially TV.

18:51.589 --> 18:53.383
I mean, TV is --
there's no way around it,

18:53.425 --> 18:55.385
and it's like a physical thing
will start happening

18:55.427 --> 18:57.178
where you start not
being able to breathe and you --

18:57.220 --> 18:58.388
[ Breathing heavily ]

18:58.430 --> 18:59.431
You know what I mean?
And that's --

18:59.472 --> 19:00.682
I did that for blinds.

19:00.724 --> 19:02.642
When Eli started
singing today,

19:02.684 --> 19:05.395
I heard the reason
why I pressed my button.

19:05.437 --> 19:08.565
He has an amazingly
beautiful tone.

19:08.606 --> 19:10.817
I think he just really needs
to work on his body language

19:10.859 --> 19:12.527
and get comfortable
in his skin.

19:12.569 --> 19:14.612
It's a confidence thing
that you know you have.

19:14.654 --> 19:16.406
Like you said, everyone's good
in their bedroom,

19:16.448 --> 19:18.616
but you are that good.
Yeah.

19:18.658 --> 19:21.244
I just heard you sing it.
You are that good.

19:21.286 --> 19:25.081
I just think her ability
to teach others her confidence

19:25.123 --> 19:27.584
is something that's
gonna help me big time.

19:27.625 --> 19:30.295
Jason,
you can feel your ease.

19:30.337 --> 19:31.755
I think you can be
more animated.

19:31.796 --> 19:33.715
Sometimes,
I'm losing you a little bit.

19:33.757 --> 19:35.425
Don't throw away
the note,

19:35.467 --> 19:37.552
'cause that's what's
so impressive about the song.

19:37.594 --> 19:39.429
* And if I choose the one... *

19:39.471 --> 19:42.682
Gwen:
Jason has this gorgeous vibrato.

19:42.724 --> 19:47.145
He has this airy,
kind of raspy, beautiful tone.

19:47.187 --> 19:52.067
* You *

19:52.108 --> 19:53.485
It sounds so pretty.

19:53.526 --> 19:54.652
That sounded way better.
Thank you.

19:54.694 --> 19:56.613
It did.
Really special.

19:56.654 --> 19:58.907
Oh, my gosh.
I love it so much.

19:58.948 --> 20:00.950
Just when I'm thinking,
"Oh, I think I like --"

20:00.992 --> 20:03.411
Then I'm like,
"God, he's got --"

20:03.453 --> 20:05.413
It's a pretty good battle,
I have to say.

20:05.455 --> 20:07.832
Eli, I want us both
to succeed.

20:07.874 --> 20:08.875
At the same time,

20:08.917 --> 20:10.460
I've worked so hard
to be here, man,

20:10.502 --> 20:14.839
and I'm gonna do
whatever I can to beat you.

20:14.881 --> 20:16.591
Hugs?
Eli: Thanks, Gwen.

20:16.633 --> 20:17.801
Thank you.
You did so good.

20:17.842 --> 20:19.219
I appreciate it.

20:19.260 --> 20:20.970
I'm looking forward
to battles. Oh, man.
I can't wait.

20:21.012 --> 20:22.639
This one is another
tough decision.

20:22.681 --> 20:24.265
They equally are gifted.

20:24.307 --> 20:27.268
They both have
incredible talent.

20:27.310 --> 20:28.770
Give my love to everybody.

20:28.812 --> 20:31.690
But it's gonna come down
to, like, who's ready.

20:31.731 --> 20:32.816

That was so, like,
fun and soulful,

23:35.373 --> 23:38.793
and you got these handsome
gentlemen to serenade you.

of my favorite songs.

I like the moves.

with it.

Jason, I really love
the gentleness of your tone,

23:58.855 --> 24:02.442
and, Eli, I loved how confident
and in command

24:02.484 --> 24:03.777
you felt the whole time.

24:03.818 --> 24:06.654
So, I think I would side
just slightly with Eli.

sounded great together.

the little choreography moves,

24:16.081 --> 24:18.625
and the interaction
with the audience

24:18.667 --> 24:19.834
was really, really good.

You both
did a great job.

I'd go with Eli.

you did a great job.

for taking on that fit,

24:39.979 --> 24:41.731

don't have the arms

24:41.773 --> 24:43.775
to take on a shirt
like that.

Poor Eli is so tired.

and classic.

an etherealness

built into you.

so far
from both of these guys,

bit more towards Jason.

Give us some thoughts
first on the battle.

right now.

to both of you saying,

"I have zero -- zero idea
of what to do at this point."

and there was a lot of growth.

beautiful voice.

25:58.975 --> 26:00.685

a really great job

and I didn't expect
anything less.

26:02.729 --> 26:04.689
Eli, yours just, like,
shocked me.

26:04.731 --> 26:06.191
Like, I pushed my button,

26:06.232 --> 26:08.860
then you had this, like,
meltdown on stage,

26:08.902 --> 26:10.195
and then in rehearsals,

26:10.236 --> 26:12.614
I was shocked
with the tone of your voice.

26:12.655 --> 26:14.032
You can go up into
your head voice.

26:14.074 --> 26:16.034
You have
a really warm chest voice.

26:16.076 --> 26:17.869
I got to probably go
with the person

26:17.911 --> 26:19.371
that I feel like
is more ready.

26:19.412 --> 26:21.039
Let me just think about this.
Go ahead, Carson.

26:21.081 --> 26:23.541

know who that person is.

this is so upsetting.

the person I think is ready

26:36.471 --> 26:39.391
right, right now...

26:39.432 --> 26:42.143

you won the battle.

knockouts with Team Gwen.

You deserve it.

26:49.776 --> 26:51.695
Get up there.

26:51.736 --> 26:54.906
Gwen:
Jason has the kind of voice
that just has this breathy,

26:54.948 --> 26:57.033
airy, serene quality

26:57.075 --> 26:59.202
that I would actually
listen to on a record.

26:59.244 --> 27:01.246
I-I think he's just
really gifted.

27:01.287 --> 27:03.998
I was so proud of you.
I was so proud of it.

27:04.040 --> 27:07.460
He is kind of
an understated singer

27:07.502 --> 27:09.587
compared to some
of these people on here

27:09.629 --> 27:11.131
that can do vocal acrobatics,

27:11.172 --> 27:13.091
so I'm gonna have to be
really strategic

27:13.133 --> 27:16.511
with picking songs
that highlight his tone

27:16.553 --> 27:18.096
and what he can do.

27:18.138 --> 27:20.056
Thank you
for the opportunity.

27:20.098 --> 27:23.560
I'm so stoked. I'm just learning
so much along the way,

27:23.601 --> 27:26.688
and I'm just glad that I'm --
I'm staying on Team Gwen.

27:26.730 --> 27:28.940
Coaches, let me remind you,
Eli is available to steal.

27:28.982 --> 27:30.692
Eli, anything you want
to say to Gwen?

27:30.734 --> 27:32.193
I love you.
I love you, too.

27:32.235 --> 27:34.237
You have been
so incredible for me,

27:34.279 --> 27:36.364
being able to, like,
conjure up enough confidence

27:36.406 --> 27:39.492
to just, like, go up
and own a stage, I owe you.

27:39.534 --> 27:41.119
I loved working with you.

27:41.161 --> 27:44.289
Give it up one more time for
Eli Ward, ladies and gentlemen.

27:44.330 --> 27:46.166
That was
a really hard decision.

27:46.207 --> 27:49.002
Thank you so much.
You did so good.
You did so good.

27:49.044 --> 27:50.462
He's showing me things

27:50.503 --> 27:52.297
that I didn't know
he even had inside of him,

27:52.339 --> 27:55.050
but I just don't know
how consistent he can be

27:55.091 --> 27:57.093
with his vocal at this point.

27:57.135 --> 27:59.387
He's very, very handsome
up close.

27:59.429 --> 28:00.430
I loved him.

28:00.472 --> 28:02.599
I was really close
to stealing him,

28:02.640 --> 28:04.225
but I was like,
"You know, let me hold off

28:04.267 --> 28:05.935
because I might
find another artist

28:05.977 --> 28:07.812
that's a little more
in my wheelhouse."

28:07.854 --> 28:09.314
But I really liked Eli.

28:09.356 --> 28:12.233
He's gotten so much better,
by the way. So good.

28:12.275 --> 28:15.153
He did amazing, but wouldn't
quite fit in on Team Niall.

28:15.195 --> 28:18.073
You okay?
It's really hard.

28:24.704 --> 28:26.039

Hello!
Hi!

28:39.135 --> 28:40.804
How are you?
Mara. Claudia.

28:40.845 --> 28:42.430
Hello.
Hi.

28:42.472 --> 28:43.890
How are you?
I'm so excited.
I've been waiting so long.

28:43.932 --> 28:45.100
Mara: He had his,
like, arms wide open.

28:45.141 --> 28:47.644
I was like, "John!"
[ Laughs ]

28:47.686 --> 28:50.230
I, like, ran up to him
and gave him the biggest hug.

28:50.271 --> 28:51.856
We are more excited.
Welcome to the battles.

28:51.898 --> 28:55.193
I grew up loving his music,
so to get to work with him,

28:55.235 --> 28:57.445
I almost have to pinch myself.

28:57.487 --> 28:59.989
I'm so excited for you two
to sing together.

29:00.031 --> 29:01.741
Claudia.
Yes!

29:01.783 --> 29:04.744
You did Michael Jackson
during the blinds.
I know. I know.

29:04.786 --> 29:06.162
That was
a cool choice.

29:06.204 --> 29:07.622
Thank you.
That's a really
great song.

29:07.664 --> 29:10.625
* Hear her voice *

29:10.667 --> 29:13.420
* Shake my window *
Let's go!

29:13.461 --> 29:16.756
* Why? *

29:16.798 --> 29:19.634
That was such a brave song
choice, such a bluesy version.

29:19.676 --> 29:21.219
I can see why you chose
that song.

29:21.261 --> 29:22.762
I would love
to have you on Team Legend.

29:22.804 --> 29:25.432
I really understand where
you're coming from as an artist.

29:25.473 --> 29:27.475
We could do a lot of
great things together.

29:27.517 --> 29:28.560
Yes!

29:28.601 --> 29:30.020
Claudia:
I started a little pop country

29:30.061 --> 29:31.771
and now I'm pop, R&B, soul.

29:31.813 --> 29:34.524
So I picked John because
I'm trying to find my lane,

29:34.566 --> 29:37.694
and I really think John
will help me on that journey.

29:37.736 --> 29:39.362
Mara,
four chairs turned,

29:39.404 --> 29:40.822
then we sing
"All of Me" together.

29:40.864 --> 29:42.282
We created quite a moment.

29:42.323 --> 29:45.285
* 'Cause all of me *

29:45.326 --> 29:48.663
* Loves all of you *

29:48.705 --> 29:50.457
I was the first one
who turned for you.

29:50.498 --> 29:53.126
They didn't have the foresight
that I had in understanding

29:53.168 --> 29:55.378
what a gem you are
as a vocalist.

[ Cheers and applause ]

29:57.964 --> 30:00.967
Gwen: Oh!
What an idiot!

30:01.009 --> 30:02.218
You're shameless.

30:02.260 --> 30:04.137
I'm gonna go with John.
Yes!

30:04.179 --> 30:06.598
I chose John because
when we sang together,

30:06.639 --> 30:09.267
it felt like
I've known him for years.

30:09.309 --> 30:11.853
I think that I really connect
with him musically.

30:11.895 --> 30:15.231
It all feels so just right.

30:15.273 --> 30:16.858
Thank you for
fighting for me.

30:16.900 --> 30:18.318
Of course.
That was fun.

30:18.360 --> 30:20.153
It felt like we were
supposed to sing together.

30:20.195 --> 30:22.280
It was meant to be.
It was meant to be.

30:22.322 --> 30:24.282
What have you been doing
since the blinds?

30:24.324 --> 30:26.493
A lot of spending time
with the family.

30:26.534 --> 30:28.161
Does anybody else
sing in your family?

30:28.203 --> 30:31.748
My older sister does
and my older brother does.

30:31.790 --> 30:34.334
Woman: Always singing at 2:00
in the morning.

30:34.376 --> 30:36.002
Woman #2:
Waking everybody up.

30:36.044 --> 30:37.212
Okay.

30:37.253 --> 30:39.422
My family, we love music.

30:39.464 --> 30:42.425
When I got to high school,
I did drama with my brother.

30:42.467 --> 30:44.177
I'm always trying
to sing with my sister,

30:44.219 --> 30:46.304
so we'll do covers online.

30:46.346 --> 30:49.224
So, always having fun,
always singing around the house.

30:49.265 --> 30:51.434
[ Cheers and applause ]

30:51.476 --> 30:54.854
Recently, I started doing
local gigs down by the shore.

30:54.896 --> 30:58.483
Every single performance,
my family is at the first table.

30:58.525 --> 31:00.819
They really are so supportive.

31:00.860 --> 31:02.028
Thank you.

It really means the world to me.

Man:
This is the mother bear.

31:05.532 --> 31:07.742
Mara: My mom's been going
through a lot recently.

31:07.784 --> 31:12.622
She was diagnosed with breast
cancer a couple months ago.

31:12.664 --> 31:16.334
They just found
there are more tumors now.

31:16.376 --> 31:19.462
I think it completely changes

31:19.504 --> 31:21.506
what this experience
means to me.

31:21.548 --> 31:25.301
I know she's fighting
this battle right now,

31:25.343 --> 31:29.723
but she gives me strength
to move forward.

31:29.764 --> 31:33.893
[ Voice breaking ] It makes me
so happy that I am in a place

31:33.935 --> 31:37.647
where I can go after my dreams.

31:37.689 --> 31:41.401
When this is all over,
I'm taking her to Italy.

31:41.443 --> 31:43.445
We're going. We've never been.

31:43.486 --> 31:47.657
It's gonna happen.
I know it will.

31:47.699 --> 31:49.242
I picked
"Son of a Preacher Man"

31:49.284 --> 31:50.910
by Dusty Springfield,

31:50.952 --> 31:53.038
because I felt like both of you
would sound so good on it.

31:53.079 --> 31:55.707
It's such a good
crossover between soul
and pop and rock, too.

31:55.749 --> 31:57.208
Right?
Yeah.

31:57.250 --> 31:59.919
It's right in the wheelhouse
of everything the two of you do.

clear and a little bit more pop.

John: And Mara's voice
is a little grittier,

32:14.726 --> 32:16.144
and she's a bit more
of a throwback.

John: I like how you rocked
out a bit.

32:30.533 --> 32:32.535
What I love about
Dusty's version

was how she wasn't
trying too hard.

32:34.829 --> 32:36.039
Yes.

Make sure you keep
some of that energy of like,

"I'm a badass.
I'm not trying too hard.

a gospel tinge to it.

to force it."

that my fiancé, Jacob,
is the son of a pastor.

the son of a preacher man.

Jacob and I -- we've been
together almost four years.

Many months ago,
we planned a trip to Paris.

towards a bridge

to get a nice view
of the Eiffel Tower.

I was totally shocked,
and I said yes.

33:26.464 --> 33:28.675
Immediately
got called for "The Voice,"

33:28.717 --> 33:30.343
so as soon as "The Voice"
is done,

33:30.385 --> 33:32.929
we'll probably do
a little elopement.

and practicing together,

to steal you.

Beautiful.

So good.

I've been in this business
a long time,

37:59.571 --> 38:02.949
and you guys
are 25 and 21?

38:02.991 --> 38:06.244
That's not right.
[ Laughter ]

38:06.286 --> 38:09.956
At 21, you know, I'd stand up
behind a microphone.

38:09.998 --> 38:12.334
How do y'all do this?
You're so talented.

38:12.375 --> 38:14.627
You're so young.
I'm just -- I don't get it.

Wow.

38:16.880 --> 38:20.967
Claudia, unbelievable vocal,
stage presence.

38:21.009 --> 38:24.346
Mara, your voice, your range,
your attitude.

38:24.387 --> 38:27.057
You got in there,
and you were all tough about it.

38:27.098 --> 38:30.226
When y'all got into it,
I got into it.

38:30.268 --> 38:31.853
That's a good performer.

38:31.895 --> 38:35.357
You let the person that is
watching and listening

38:35.398 --> 38:36.649
forget all the troubles.

38:36.691 --> 38:38.026
You draw them in.

38:38.068 --> 38:40.695
So, that is a great trait
both of you have.

38:40.737 --> 38:44.407
I guess if I had to pick one,
I'd say Claudia.

38:44.449 --> 38:45.658
Thank you.

Haven't heard that song sung
that well in a while,

its first release.

[ Laughter ]

38:53.750 --> 38:56.795
I remember both of your
auditions extremely well.

38:56.836 --> 38:59.589
The two of you, I turned for,
and felt very sad

38:59.631 --> 39:01.091
that I didn't have you
on my team.

39:01.132 --> 39:03.468
And, Mara, I remember
just thinking, "superstar,"

39:03.510 --> 39:06.471
and, Claudia, what I loved about
you is Mara is doing, like,

39:06.513 --> 39:09.140
a lot of, like, stage presence
stuff, it's amazing,

39:09.182 --> 39:12.143
and you were still able to have
that much power and control

39:12.185 --> 39:13.812
whilst being yourself
in the song.

39:13.853 --> 39:15.897
It's very easy to try
and get up

39:15.939 --> 39:17.816
and do the stuff
that Mara wants to do,

39:17.857 --> 39:19.943
and you still managed to, like,
make it your own.

39:19.984 --> 39:23.029
Singing harmony like that the
way you did, it was flawless.

39:23.071 --> 39:24.739
My God, John, have you
got a problem here.

39:24.781 --> 39:26.491
Just 'cause
I have to say someone,

39:26.533 --> 39:28.159
I would lean towards Mara.

39:28.201 --> 39:31.621
Claudia, I think what I love
about you is your style.

39:31.663 --> 39:34.791
Like, you have a very strong
identity through your voice.

39:34.833 --> 39:36.710
That's something that
you can't really teach somebody,

39:36.751 --> 39:39.337
and that makes us get to know
who you are.

39:39.379 --> 39:40.755
You stand out, you know?

39:40.797 --> 39:43.550
I think for me,
the moment Mara walked on stage,

39:43.591 --> 39:46.428
there was a star quality
in her walk.

39:46.469 --> 39:48.179
Is that possible?
Yes, it is.

39:48.221 --> 39:51.182
I do it every day.
[ Laughter ]

39:51.224 --> 39:55.770
The performance was animated
and flawless. So, I don't know.

39:55.812 --> 39:57.439
I think it is really,
really hard.

39:57.480 --> 40:00.775
You're both very different,
but because of this other thing

40:00.817 --> 40:02.068
that you can't put
your finger on,

40:02.110 --> 40:04.404
I would probably say Mara.

Alright, John, you got a tough
decision here in a minute.

40:10.201 --> 40:12.454
But first, give us
some thoughts on that battle.

40:12.495 --> 40:14.122
You just delivered today,

40:14.164 --> 40:15.874

to be your coach.

Thank you so much.

40:20.170 --> 40:21.338
Your tones
are so different.

40:21.379 --> 40:24.174
Claudia,
yours has a lot more clarity.

40:24.215 --> 40:26.634
It's more, like,
pure in one way,

40:26.676 --> 40:29.054
and then Mara's
is a bit more edgy,

40:29.095 --> 40:32.724
and it's got a bit more
of a rock energy to it.

40:32.766 --> 40:34.476
But I have to decide.

40:34.517 --> 40:35.852
John, the time has come.

Both of these artists
really did what they do best.

40:53.953 --> 40:55.622
This is a very tough choice

40:55.663 --> 40:57.165
because Claudia
did nothing wrong.

40:57.207 --> 40:59.793
She sounded so great,
she has such a great tone,

a little bit more edge.
