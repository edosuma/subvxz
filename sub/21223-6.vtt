<i>With the new Magna Carta</i>

00:22.920 --> 00:24.880
<i>still in a persistent</i>
<i>vegetative state,</i>

00:25.200 --> 00:27.200
<i>Prince Charles has made this</i>
<i>intervention.</i>

00:28.040 --> 00:30.640
<i>I announce my intention</i>
<i>to be</i>
<i>that absolute monarch.</i>

00:31.360 --> 00:34.040
<i>This is in accordance</i>
<i>of the wishes of my mama,</i>

00:34.360 --> 00:38.360
<i>as outlined by my papa</i>
<i>in this</i>
<i>prepared statement.</i>

00:38.760 --> 00:39.560
[clears throat]

00:39.840 --> 00:40.720
<i>For fuck's sake,</i>

00:41.280 --> 00:43.720
<i>we're too old</i>
<i>and knackered</i>
<i>for all this bollocks.</i>

00:44.080 --> 00:46.320
<i>We don't mind opening</i>
<i>the odd day center,</i>

00:46.760 --> 00:50.520
<i>but if you want us to rule,</i>
<i>you can fuck right off.</i>

00:51.040 --> 00:53.760
<i>On behalf of Her Majesty,</i>
<i>the Queen,</i>
<i>thank you very much.</i>

00:54.040 --> 00:55.640
<i>No questions now. Thank you.</i>

00:56.520 --> 00:58.400
Well, you can't take over.
It's insane.

00:58.520 --> 01:01.760
-The country needs me.
-Us, darling. Us.

01:01.840 --> 01:03.880
Well, who knows,
that Magna Carta
may not even be genuine.

01:03.960 --> 01:06.360
It's been verified
by the finest
legal minds in the country.

01:06.560 --> 01:09.000
And the entire
Antiques Roadshow team.

01:09.200 --> 01:12.600
-You don't have the right.
-I have the Divine Right
of Kings.

01:12.880 --> 01:16.880
Not necessarily given
by God, probably
some sort of superior alien

01:16.960 --> 01:18.400
life form
that talks like this.

01:18.760 --> 01:21.080
[whistles]

01:21.800 --> 01:23.360
-Do you really think that?
-Oh, yes.

01:23.480 --> 01:25.680
You wouldn't believe
what I've got tucked away
up here.

01:25.960 --> 01:28.920
I don't know
why you're fighting us
on this. After me, it's you.

01:29.040 --> 01:30.440
But only after me.

01:30.560 --> 01:32.280
But we don't want
absolute power.

01:32.400 --> 01:35.920
We want to cycle round
on bicycles in chinos
and light sweaters,

01:36.000 --> 01:39.400
-suggesting we're normal.
-Exactly,
like the Dutch royal family

01:39.640 --> 01:41.480
or Chris Martin
from Coldplay.

01:41.600 --> 01:43.120
And the public
will never stand for it.

01:43.200 --> 01:44.920
The public will do
what they're bloody told.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.040
Well, that's where
you're wrong.

01:46.320 --> 01:47.960
They live and breathe
and think.

01:48.040 --> 01:50.840
-Anatomically, they're
exactly the same as us.
-You're wasting your breath.

01:50.920 --> 01:53.160
We only need
one major world leader
to give us a thumbs up,

01:53.240 --> 01:55.120
and the whole UN will fall
into line.

01:55.200 --> 01:56.680
And what kind of nutter
would do that?

01:57.200 --> 01:59.160
I've got one or two ideas.

01:59.240 --> 02:01.160
[newsreader] <i>In other news,</i>
<i>Donald Trump's state visit</i>

02:01.240 --> 02:02.280

02:02.680 --> 02:06.040
<i>I don't care if Theresa May</i>
<i>is in a persistent</i>

02:06.320 --> 02:10.479
<i>I was promised a trip</i>
<i>to Britain and</i>
<i>I want a trip to Britain.</i>

02:10.840 --> 02:12.680
And who's going to pay
for it?

02:13.040 --> 02:15.400
-British Airways!
-[audience] British Airways!

02:20.400 --> 02:21.880
Oh, buggeration.

02:22.560 --> 02:23.440
[sighs]

02:25.880 --> 02:27.960
Sorry, mate.
You're in the infantry
this trip.

02:28.040 --> 02:28.800
[door opens]

02:29.480 --> 02:31.040
So, you're really going
to LA?

02:31.200 --> 02:33.120
Yeah, I can't wait
to see Megan.

02:33.520 --> 02:35.560
And not much for me
to stick around for here.

02:35.880 --> 02:37.720
-I mean,
you're getting married.
-Yes.

02:38.720 --> 02:41.720
Yes, I am. Unless someone
were to stop me.

02:42.280 --> 02:44.000
Well, that would be
a very mean thing to do.

02:45.800 --> 02:49.280
Well, perhaps,
it wouldn't be if deep down,
I didn't want to get married

02:49.360 --> 02:52.040
or thought I was marrying
the wrong person.

02:52.280 --> 02:53.560
Oh, well, in that situation,

02:53.640 --> 02:55.400
it would be
absolutely the right thing
to do.

02:55.480 --> 02:58.840
Yes. And, I'd be
so grateful to them.

02:59.680 --> 03:00.440
Oh, my God.

03:01.440 --> 03:03.040
I've just realized
why you've come.

03:03.920 --> 03:05.680
-Yes.
-It's fate.

03:06.440 --> 03:07.880
You can sit on my suitcase.

03:07.960 --> 03:09.200
That way,
I'll get the tank in.

03:13.960 --> 03:15.800
Reinstalling is exhausting.

03:15.960 --> 03:17.320
Oh, it's from Uncle Charles.

03:17.600 --> 03:20.160
He says that
once the absolute monarchy
starts,

03:20.400 --> 03:22.920
we're going to need
to perform
ceremonial duties again,

03:23.080 --> 03:25.800
and he's offering
a very attractive salary.

03:26.440 --> 03:28.360
This is it, Bea. Right.

03:28.440 --> 03:29.840
That's going
straight in the bin.

03:32.520 --> 03:35.600
But, Eugenie, we fought
so hard
to make it on our own.

03:35.800 --> 03:38.200
And we're so close
to making it happen.

03:40.440 --> 03:42.200
Oh, come on, Bea.

03:42.360 --> 03:44.400
We're being offered
two mill each,

03:44.480 --> 03:48.160
inflation pegged
for the rest of our lives
to cut ribbons.

03:48.240 --> 03:50.080
Yeah, but it comes
at a cost.

03:50.440 --> 03:51.920
Our self worth.

03:52.560 --> 03:53.320
Bea...

03:53.800 --> 03:54.840
You're nearly 30.

03:55.280 --> 03:56.440
It's not happening.

03:58.040 --> 04:01.520
Actually, we probably
could do more
for women in business

04:01.600 --> 04:05.840
from a royal platform
than actually
being women in business.

04:05.960 --> 04:07.480
Exactly.

04:14.160 --> 04:15.600
Like some toast, Andy?

04:17.200 --> 04:19.000
I'll butter it for you.

04:20.440 --> 04:22.079
[phone rings]
[chuckles]

04:22.720 --> 04:23.560
Hello?

04:24.440 --> 04:27.120
It's Pippa. Are you free
on Saturday night?

04:27.280 --> 04:29.800
Saturday? Erm,
let me have a look.

04:29.880 --> 04:31.600
[clock ticking]

04:34.920 --> 04:37.440
Completely free.
What's occurring?

04:37.560 --> 04:41.120
It's my hen night.
My usual friends
have all pulled out,

04:41.280 --> 04:44.040
saying I'm a self-absorbed
social climber or some shit.

04:44.120 --> 04:46.320
I wasn't listening.
Anyway, can you come?

04:46.400 --> 04:47.720
Oh, I'd love to. I...

04:47.920 --> 04:49.400
Right,
I'll text you the details.

04:49.840 --> 04:51.520
Thank you. Thank you.
[dial tone]

04:51.600 --> 04:53.400
Oh, she hung up.

04:55.680 --> 04:58.760
So, is it all right, Andy,
if I go out Saturday?

05:03.360 --> 05:04.240
Kate, there you are.

05:04.920 --> 05:06.400
What on earth
are you doing
with that penis?

05:06.880 --> 05:08.680
Pippa's put me in charge
of her hen do.

05:09.160 --> 05:10.320
Which one do you think?

05:11.440 --> 05:12.200
[door shuts]

05:12.280 --> 05:14.680
We're supposed to be
finding out if the people
really do support

05:14.760 --> 05:16.920
an absolute monarchy,
and we've only got
the weekend.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.600
Well, do it in here.

05:25.520 --> 05:28.200
Mmm, she has got
a nice pair.

05:28.720 --> 05:31.080
So, what do you think
about that
absolute monarchy thing?

05:31.240 --> 05:33.840
Well, in these
chaotic times,
we do need stability.

05:34.080 --> 05:37.240
And the Tories and Labor,
they've had enough chances.

05:37.400 --> 05:39.920
And, I don't really like
voting. Save me a job.

05:40.320 --> 05:43.000
What are you talking about?
They're unelected.

05:43.160 --> 05:44.160
Do you really want
to throw away

05:44.240 --> 05:47.920
democratic freedoms people
have fought and died for
over 1,000 years?

05:48.200 --> 05:49.080
Prince William?

05:49.960 --> 05:52.000
What are you doing in
an unlicensed sex shop?

05:54.520 --> 05:55.280
Let's go.

05:55.520 --> 05:56.320
I'll just get this.

05:58.240 --> 05:59.000
Edward!

05:59.160 --> 06:01.480
Oh, hello, Kate, Wills.

06:01.600 --> 06:02.720
This is my new job.

06:02.920 --> 06:04.480
I really think I've turned
a corner.

06:04.600 --> 06:06.840
Isn't the whole
sex industry thing
moving more online?

06:07.880 --> 06:09.160
Not that I know
much about it.

06:09.280 --> 06:11.400
Oh, no, no.
It's a people industry.

06:11.560 --> 06:13.440
They like
the face-to-face contact.

06:13.920 --> 06:14.920
Oh, hello, Michael.

06:15.920 --> 06:16.800
Usual?

06:19.040 --> 06:21.360
Just wish there were
some other way to fight
this absolute monarchy.

06:21.720 --> 06:22.800
I still think
there's something odd

06:22.880 --> 06:24.520
about that Magna Carta
just turning up.

06:24.640 --> 06:25.360
[whimpers]

06:26.600 --> 06:27.480
Edward?

06:30.400 --> 06:32.000
We know the Magna Carta
is a forgery.

06:32.080 --> 06:34.640
Edward told us everything
and he'sprepared
to go public with it.

06:34.760 --> 06:37.920
Is this the same Edward
whose debts
to the Triads, the Yakuza,

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
and Payday Lenders R Us
I've just cleared?

06:41.520 --> 06:43.120
He's not going public
with anything.

06:43.200 --> 06:44.960
And if you insist on going
to the press,

06:45.080 --> 06:47.480
I'll be forced
to make it known that Kate

06:48.160 --> 06:49.440
is a bigamist.

06:50.400 --> 06:51.400
Don't be ridiculous!

06:51.480 --> 06:54.480
-Oh, you haven't told him?
-I... I...

06:54.560 --> 06:57.720
You see,
when she married you, Will,
she was already married...

06:58.920 --> 07:01.160
...to a Gypsy called Ricky.

07:01.880 --> 07:02.680
That's not true.

07:04.280 --> 07:05.920
Kate?
Tell her it's not true.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.400
She's twisting it all up!

07:08.200 --> 07:10.160
Although, I was married
to a Gypsy called Ricky.

07:10.800 --> 07:15.120
He was blackmailing her.
I made
that particular situation

07:15.200 --> 07:18.560
go away
by cryogenically
freezing him.

07:18.640 --> 07:19.320
[Kate gasps]

07:19.520 --> 07:23.080
But I can defrost him
any time I like.

07:23.160 --> 07:23.760
Kate...

07:25.040 --> 07:26.040
You lied to me.

07:26.400 --> 07:27.640
Something we said
we'd never do.

07:27.880 --> 07:31.000
I know, and I'm sorry,
but you lied to me

07:31.080 --> 07:32.520
when you went to bed
with Nicola Sturgeon

07:32.600 --> 07:34.120
in her holiday persona
of Flame.

07:34.200 --> 07:36.160
I explained that was
just for body warmth!

07:36.240 --> 07:37.680
Looks like I've won.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.400
Yes, but along the way,
you may well have destroyed
our relationship.

07:45.840 --> 07:46.720
Will!

07:49.600 --> 07:50.720
Double bubble.

07:57.440 --> 07:59.920
Well, thanks very much,
Kate. This is shit.

08:00.080 --> 08:02.440
I'm sorry, Pippa.
I've got a lot on my mind.

08:02.560 --> 08:04.320
My marriage is this close
to disintegrating.

08:04.440 --> 08:06.000
Well, this isn't about you.

08:06.080 --> 08:09.520
This is about me.
Whatever you've got lined up
for later

08:09.680 --> 08:12.960
better be more exciting
than that pottery course
this afternoon.

08:14.960 --> 08:16.920
Do you really think
we should have
come out tonight?

08:17.080 --> 08:18.680
It's our final blowout,

08:18.800 --> 08:21.800
before we commit ourselves
to a life of royal duty.

08:21.880 --> 08:23.760
Yeah. So, what do we have
lined up this week?

08:23.920 --> 08:26.080
A film premiere
with Ryan Reynolds.

08:26.240 --> 08:27.000
Foof!

08:27.640 --> 08:29.560
Well, in that case,
we do deserve a night out.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.440
[dance music plays]

08:31.720 --> 08:35.520
-Oh, sounds like something's
happening.
-About bloody time.

08:36.280 --> 08:37.880
It's hot in here.

08:38.280 --> 08:41.520
Thank goodness
I've got a very long hose.

08:41.799 --> 08:43.280
[exclaiming excitedly]

08:43.520 --> 08:44.960
Spray me! Spray me!

08:45.160 --> 08:46.320
I'm on fire!

08:46.760 --> 08:48.320
Take your pants off!

08:48.400 --> 08:53.200
You may be hot now,
but soon, you're going to be
dripping wet.

08:53.640 --> 08:55.120
I'm sorry,
that was a bit rude.

08:56.960 --> 08:57.920
Edward.

08:58.040 --> 09:00.280
Pippa. Oh, it's all of you.

09:00.480 --> 09:02.080
I didn't recognize you
with the glasses.

09:02.160 --> 09:04.640
-Show us your willy!
-No, Mummy,
it's Uncle Edward.

09:04.720 --> 09:05.440
Oh.

09:06.320 --> 09:07.640
Show us your willy!

09:08.880 --> 09:11.320
You booked Edward
to strip at my hen party?

09:11.400 --> 09:12.960
I booked it
through a sex shop.

09:13.120 --> 09:15.680
-I thought Camilla
had cleared your debts.
-She did.

09:16.320 --> 09:19.680
Congratulations,
you've ruined my hen night.

09:19.760 --> 09:21.640
[somber
instrumental music playing]

09:24.600 --> 09:25.760
Wotcher, Pips.

09:26.600 --> 09:28.760
Harry.
What are you doing here?

09:28.880 --> 09:29.760
I heard a whisper

09:29.840 --> 09:32.640
that you were
going to stick a grand
behind the bar.

09:33.600 --> 09:35.000
Let's get some shots in.

09:35.720 --> 09:36.520
Boom!

09:36.600 --> 09:38.960
[party music playing]

09:41.120 --> 09:42.800
[screaming] [cheering]

09:48.200 --> 09:49.360
Yeah!

09:57.840 --> 09:59.560
[cheering]

10:08.520 --> 10:09.920
Who the hell
is Donald Trump?

10:10.200 --> 10:13.400
I can't believe
our American cousins
elected such a vulgarian.

10:13.600 --> 10:16.360
Richard Nixon
must be spinning
in his grave.

10:16.480 --> 10:19.000
We need his endorsement,
so be nice.

10:19.320 --> 10:21.560
[usher] The President
of the United States.

10:23.400 --> 10:25.280
-Mr President.
-Mr King.

10:26.080 --> 10:27.320
Camilla, look at you.

10:27.400 --> 10:31.200
You are beautiful,
you are classy.
So important to be classy.

10:31.600 --> 10:33.960
-And what a rack.
-How sweet of you to notice.

10:34.080 --> 10:35.480
[shouting] Let's cut the BS!

10:35.760 --> 10:39.760
You need my endorsement
to swing things at the UN!

10:39.920 --> 10:41.000
Why are you shouting,
Donald?

10:41.120 --> 10:42.840
Because I'm erratic!

10:43.120 --> 10:46.440
I'm a deal-maker. I make
deals, beautiful deals,
so beautiful.

10:46.640 --> 10:48.480
But what do I get in return?

10:48.560 --> 10:49.560
This visit.

10:49.680 --> 10:51.680
-It's giving you
credibility.
-Don't need it.

10:52.040 --> 10:53.680
My government's
a finely tuned machine,

10:53.760 --> 10:56.680
and it's going so nicely.
But, you need me.

10:56.880 --> 10:57.960
So, what do you want?

10:58.080 --> 10:58.960
Her.

11:00.320 --> 11:03.560
Are you suggesting
some sort of
indecent proposal?

11:03.680 --> 11:06.360
What's indecent
about two consenting adults

11:06.440 --> 11:09.600
on a four-poster bed
going at it like baboons?

11:09.920 --> 11:12.840
Out of the question.
I couldn't countenance
such a proposition.

11:13.240 --> 11:14.840
Okay, I can walk away.

11:15.240 --> 11:16.440
But, the deal's
on the table...

11:16.760 --> 11:19.200
[shouting]
...for one hour only!

11:20.280 --> 11:22.320
[ominous music playing]

11:29.000 --> 11:31.280
You're not really
going to go through
with this, are you?

11:31.480 --> 11:34.480
Believe me, I would rather
eat the cling-ons
round a badger's arse,

11:34.640 --> 11:39.680
but we need his support,
and I have been with many,
many men before.

11:39.880 --> 11:41.800
But that was before
we were married.

11:44.280 --> 11:45.480
We're stronger than that,
Charles.

11:45.600 --> 11:47.520
We can get through this
the same way
we've got through

11:47.600 --> 11:48.920
so many things before.

11:49.920 --> 11:52.160
By never, ever mentioning it
ever again.

11:52.280 --> 11:53.040
All right.

11:54.040 --> 11:55.040
What is it they say?

11:55.480 --> 11:58.160
It's your body
and you're the one
who's going to have

11:58.240 --> 12:01.080
a big, fat, sweaty property
developer on top of it.

12:01.160 --> 12:02.040
Exactly.

12:03.120 --> 12:04.160
Now, go.

12:04.640 --> 12:05.760
He'll be here any moment. Camilla, darling, I...

12:13.160 --> 12:15.360
Just don't let him
in the back doors.

12:16.160 --> 12:16.960
I won't. [whimpers]

12:23.400 --> 12:24.480
[knock at door]

12:30.720 --> 12:31.720
Hi, beautiful.

12:32.520 --> 12:33.360
Come in, Donald.

12:39.200 --> 12:41.200
[heart monitor beeping]

12:47.520 --> 12:48.360
[exhales]

12:48.440 --> 12:49.880
[bell chimes]

12:50.240 --> 12:51.400
You've given up, man.

12:51.480 --> 12:52.280
Henry VIII!

12:52.560 --> 12:54.760
Why aren't you fighting
for your country?

12:54.840 --> 12:55.840
What can I do?

12:56.600 --> 12:58.920
The Prime Minister's
in a permanent
vegetative state

12:59.000 --> 13:01.240
and the people
are crying out
for an absolute monarchy.

13:01.800 --> 13:03.280
Plus, my wife's a bigamist.

13:03.560 --> 13:05.480
Now, the first thing
to do, is to get her back.

13:05.800 --> 13:08.480
A man can't do anything
without his wife
by his side.

13:08.720 --> 13:10.960
But you were always
killing your wives.

13:11.480 --> 13:13.240
Let me tell you a story
about Anne Boleyn.

13:13.880 --> 13:15.520
I loved that woman
more than chicken,

13:15.800 --> 13:17.520
and I really love chicken.

13:18.360 --> 13:20.040
Then I found out
she'd cheated on me

13:20.320 --> 13:22.600
and, in a rage,
I had her head cut off.

13:23.800 --> 13:25.520
I've regretted it
every day since.

13:26.040 --> 13:27.120
Well, I thought
you made all that up

13:27.240 --> 13:28.600
just so you could marry
someone else.

13:29.680 --> 13:30.480
Oh, yeah.

13:31.360 --> 13:32.280
That's right, I did.

13:33.360 --> 13:34.560
That's syphilis for you-

13:35.200 --> 13:36.080
affects your thinking.

13:36.760 --> 13:38.480
No, Henry VIII,
you make a good point.

13:39.400 --> 13:42.640
I've got to get Kate back
and stop
this absolute monarchy.

13:45.360 --> 13:46.960
Have you got
any more chicken?

13:51.000 --> 13:52.640
Well, that's never happened
before.

13:53.520 --> 13:56.000
Oh, that's quite all right,
Donald, a man of your age.

13:56.080 --> 13:58.520
No, I mean,
never happened before,

13:58.920 --> 14:01.200
and anyone who says it has-
fake news!

14:01.280 --> 14:03.440
It's all right.
It'll be our little secret.

14:04.640 --> 14:08.480
Oh, by the way,
you will still
be endorsing us?

14:08.600 --> 14:10.440
Anything. Sure, anything.

14:10.520 --> 14:13.920
I thought, perhaps,
you might do it in a speech
at the wedding tomorrow.

14:14.200 --> 14:16.800
Yeah, important
to give a nice speech,

14:17.280 --> 14:18.880
but don't tell Putin
what happened.

14:19.400 --> 14:20.800
He can always get it up.

14:21.200 --> 14:22.160
[he sighs]

14:26.200 --> 14:27.080
Hello, old girl.

14:28.320 --> 14:29.680
-Andy.
-Taking a trip?

14:30.840 --> 14:32.360
Yes, I'm off to America.

14:32.520 --> 14:34.320
I'm going to try
the old Right Royal Juicer

14:34.400 --> 14:35.880
on the shopping channel
again.

14:36.400 --> 14:38.840
I don't want you doing that
any more, Fergie.

14:38.920 --> 14:40.680
You deserve
better than that.

14:43.000 --> 14:43.800
What do you mean?

14:43.920 --> 14:48.360
As soon as Charlie
takes over, he's putting me
in charge of defense.

14:48.440 --> 14:50.280
It'll be me handing out
the contracts.

14:50.360 --> 14:53.280
I'm going to be rich.
Ant and Dec rich,

14:53.360 --> 14:57.280
and I want
to take care of you forever.

14:57.400 --> 15:01.000
Oh, and I want
to be taken care of.

15:01.400 --> 15:05.120
You see, we've been through
so much
over the last 30 years.

15:05.200 --> 15:08.360
Yes, I will marry you, Andy.

15:09.760 --> 15:11.240
Marry me? No.

15:11.680 --> 15:14.360
I'm going to be
with a series
of much prettier,

15:14.520 --> 15:15.560
much younger women.

15:15.760 --> 15:18.040
But you just said
we've shared so much.

15:18.120 --> 15:20.720
Yes, you've got enough on me
to sink a battleship.

15:21.120 --> 15:24.280
The least I can do is put
a bit of cash your way.

15:24.440 --> 15:26.400
So you're buying my silence?

15:26.560 --> 15:27.440
Oh...

15:27.520 --> 15:29.520
I'm just a problem to you,
aren't I?

15:29.680 --> 15:31.320
Something you wish
you'd never done.

15:33.320 --> 15:34.280
No.

15:35.640 --> 15:37.640
I don't want your money,
Andrew.

15:37.720 --> 15:39.960
You took a lot of things
when you left,

15:40.120 --> 15:42.760
but you did not take
my dignity. You see,
I'm moved on with my life.

15:51.760 --> 15:52.880
Is that me?

15:54.080 --> 15:54.960
No.

15:56.240 --> 15:58.000
He's a better man
than you'll ever be.

15:58.080 --> 15:59.800
-[scoffs]
-He doesn't lie to me.

15:59.880 --> 16:01.320
He doesn't belittle me.

16:01.440 --> 16:04.120
He doesn't tell me
I'm too old to wear
hot pants.

16:04.320 --> 16:06.040
Now, get out!

16:11.600 --> 16:13.400
I like the dress
you picked out for me.

16:15.960 --> 16:16.880
Are you all right, Pippa?

16:17.680 --> 16:19.120
Am I doing the right thing?

16:20.320 --> 16:21.720
It's not too late
to back out.

16:22.080 --> 16:25.400
What? Always got to stick
your nose in, haven't you?

16:25.480 --> 16:26.480
But you just said...

16:26.560 --> 16:29.880
Going around giving advice
just 'cause you're married
to a prince.

16:30.240 --> 16:33.640
Well, Johnny got billions,
not millions, billions,

16:33.840 --> 16:36.280
and he's going to make me
the happiest girl
in the world.

16:36.720 --> 16:39.680
It's my dream come true!

16:40.720 --> 16:42.720
[indistinct chatter]

16:43.360 --> 16:46.200
[wedding march plays]

16:55.360 --> 16:56.680
-Kate.
-Wills.

16:57.880 --> 16:59.920
I shall take my stuff out
of the flat this afternoon.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.200
-Kate--
-No. I lied to you.

17:03.080 --> 17:05.560
I intend to rejoin
my parents'
party-planning business,

17:05.960 --> 17:09.079
and, apart from a tell-all
memoir to be serialized
in the Mail on Sunday,

17:09.640 --> 17:11.680
I shall withdraw
from public life.

17:11.960 --> 17:15.079
Oh, darling, I don't care
you're a bigamist
any more than I cared

17:15.160 --> 17:16.480
when I found out
you were a murderer.

17:16.560 --> 17:17.440
Really?

17:17.560 --> 17:19.560
I love you,
and that's all that matters.

17:19.720 --> 17:20.800
Oh, Wills...

17:21.520 --> 17:22.520
[Pippa clears her throat]

17:25.200 --> 17:27.560
[horns honk]

17:30.240 --> 17:32.760
[echoing] <i>Yes, I am,</i>
<i>unless someone</i>
<i>were to stop me.</i>

17:33.600 --> 17:37.440
<i>Perhaps it wouldn't be,</i>
<i>if deep down,</i>
<i>I didn't want to get married</i>

17:37.520 --> 17:39.840
<i>or thought I was marrying</i>
<i>the wrong person.</i>

17:39.920 --> 17:41.760
[her voice echoes]
<i>wrong person,</i>
<i>wrong person...</i>

17:44.720 --> 17:45.840
Oh, my God.

17:46.200 --> 17:47.560
Pippa's in love with me!

17:47.840 --> 17:48.640
Turn around!

17:48.720 --> 17:49.880
I've got to go back!

17:50.080 --> 17:53.120
-[horns honk]
-Oh, bloody traffic.

17:53.200 --> 17:57.720
If anyone knows
of any reason this marriage
cannot take place,

17:57.800 --> 17:58.920
please speak now.

18:00.880 --> 18:02.120
[snoring softly]

18:02.520 --> 18:04.640
[phone rings]

18:06.480 --> 18:08.120
-Harry?
-Hold up the phone.

18:09.120 --> 18:09.720
<i>Pippa...</i>

18:11.040 --> 18:12.600
<i>-Pippa!</i>
-Harry?

18:12.720 --> 18:14.560
[horn honks]

18:16.440 --> 18:17.280
Harry?

18:18.240 --> 18:19.520
Pippa! Pippa!

18:20.560 --> 18:22.640
Pippa, don't do it!
I love you.

18:22.760 --> 18:24.040
[distorted,
inaudible speech]

18:24.120 --> 18:26.040
-Harry...
-I think we'd better
move on.

18:26.280 --> 18:27.120
I want to marry you!

18:27.200 --> 18:27.880
[phone beeps]

18:28.640 --> 18:29.480
[sighs]

18:30.240 --> 18:31.160
I'll leg it.

18:31.880 --> 18:34.520
Do you, Pippa, take Johnny
to be your husband,

18:34.600 --> 18:36.600
for better, for worse,
as long as you both live?

18:37.400 --> 18:38.320
I...

18:39.080 --> 18:40.080
[retches]

18:41.000 --> 18:42.400
I... [retches]

18:43.560 --> 18:45.400
[retches]
So sorry.

18:46.040 --> 18:48.600
I don't seem to be able
to get the actual words out.

18:49.600 --> 18:51.200
Would it be okay
if I just nodded?

18:51.320 --> 18:52.200
Suits me.

18:55.240 --> 18:57.800
Kate, dad told me Trump
is going to endorse
his absolute monarchy

18:57.880 --> 18:58.880
after the wedding reception.

18:59.080 --> 19:00.560
Once that happens,
he'll be unstoppable.

19:00.680 --> 19:02.040
But that's
in a couple of hours.

19:02.120 --> 19:03.720
You may now kiss the bride.

19:05.280 --> 19:06.160
[coughs]

19:07.680 --> 19:09.680
[applause]

19:10.440 --> 19:11.400
I've got it.

19:12.120 --> 19:14.560
I know how to bring
Theresa round,
and stop Camilla.

19:17.760 --> 19:18.560
[retches]

19:20.560 --> 19:21.960
[dramatic music playing]

19:22.040 --> 19:23.400
Right, there she is.

19:24.560 --> 19:25.600
What's going on in here?

19:26.920 --> 19:28.480
-Prince William...
-My wife has an idea

19:28.560 --> 19:30.440
about how we can
bring the Prime Minister
out of her coma.

19:30.520 --> 19:31.360
Go on.

19:31.840 --> 19:35.800
For centuries, the kiss
of a prince was thought
to held magical powers,

19:36.000 --> 19:39.080
so you get my husband,
a prince, to kiss her,

19:39.160 --> 19:41.000
and she might, just might
wake up.

19:41.600 --> 19:42.520
What do you think, Doc?

19:44.440 --> 19:46.440
Well, to be honest,
it sounds a bit fuck-witted. Try it, Wills.
What have we got to lose?

19:51.680 --> 19:53.320
Well, you might get sued
by her husband.

19:53.600 --> 19:55.400
[dramatic music playing]

20:03.400 --> 20:04.200
Nothing's happening.

20:05.560 --> 20:07.680
Try a bit of tongue.

20:23.840 --> 20:24.760
You did it!

20:26.400 --> 20:27.400
Where am I?

20:28.200 --> 20:29.600
No time to explain,
Prime Minister.

20:30.680 --> 20:32.480
We have to stop
a constitutional crisis.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.960
You mean Donald Trump
couldn't get it up?

20:38.160 --> 20:39.040
Yes.

20:40.120 --> 20:43.560
I don't think we need
wait till the food
before making the speech.

20:43.720 --> 20:44.640
Hmm?

20:44.960 --> 20:46.120
[glass chimes]

20:46.920 --> 20:47.720
Hello, everyone.

20:47.880 --> 20:49.720
Er, what a splendid wedding.

20:50.240 --> 20:52.960
I've never seen two people
more in love.

20:53.080 --> 20:54.080
[sobbing]

20:54.160 --> 20:55.360
But, before we dine,

20:55.520 --> 20:59.840
I give you the President
of the United States
of America.

21:03.280 --> 21:04.440
What a wedding!

21:04.520 --> 21:07.000
So nice! Okay, so...

21:07.320 --> 21:10.880
Prince Charles, Camilla,
what a team.

21:10.960 --> 21:11.760
Hmmm...

21:11.840 --> 21:12.680
and that is why,

21:12.840 --> 21:17.840
I, as President
of the United States,

21:18.200 --> 21:19.360
and host
of <i>The Apprentice,</i>

21:19.600 --> 21:21.960
fourteen seasons,
by the way,
top of the ratings,

21:22.040 --> 21:25.320
terrible since Arnie
took over--
Had to go, so overrated...

21:25.440 --> 21:26.400
Get on with it.

21:29.160 --> 21:32.360
[whimpers]
I am proud

21:32.480 --> 21:35.880
to endorse Prince Charles
and Camilla as...

21:35.960 --> 21:36.840
Wait!

21:39.440 --> 21:42.200
Theresa May!
But her brain's
turned to jam...

21:42.320 --> 21:44.000
I've been doing the Sudoku
on the way here.

21:44.800 --> 21:45.640
I snogged her

21:45.800 --> 21:47.840
and my magical powers
as a prince
brought her round.

21:47.960 --> 21:49.040
That sounds feasible.

21:49.360 --> 21:52.440
I say that as a member
of the Homeopathy Society.

21:53.440 --> 21:55.400
[screams]

21:59.480 --> 22:01.320
Well, naturally,
we're delighted.

22:01.760 --> 22:03.720
So, Papa, our Prime Minister
is back.

22:04.040 --> 22:06.120
There will be
no absolute monarchy.

22:12.840 --> 22:14.280
Not too late, am I?

22:17.680 --> 22:18.720
Will you marry me?

22:19.640 --> 22:21.080
Of course you're too late.

22:21.200 --> 22:22.520
It's my wedding reception.

22:23.520 --> 22:24.440
I see.

22:25.080 --> 22:28.040
Then will you do me
the honor

22:28.760 --> 22:30.160
of becoming my mistress?

22:33.960 --> 22:36.760
Well, I, for one,
am pleased we won't be
absolute monarchs.

22:37.080 --> 22:39.320
It seems to me
like an awful lot
of hard work.

22:40.400 --> 22:41.240
I'm going now.

22:42.040 --> 22:44.200
There's an awful lot
of hard work to be done.

22:44.360 --> 22:45.120
See?

22:45.440 --> 22:46.920
Yeah, that's the thing,
Theresa.

22:47.160 --> 22:49.160
Everything about you
is hard work.

22:49.240 --> 22:52.560
And the first thing
I'm going to do
is get rid of the monarchy.

22:52.640 --> 22:55.080
[dramatic music playing]

22:57.280 --> 22:58.320
Good.

22:58.560 --> 23:00.400
[crowd exclaims]
You'll be doing us all
a favor.

23:02.160 --> 23:04.080
At last, we'll be free
to use our own talents to be

23:04.160 --> 23:05.240
whatever we want to be.

23:06.640 --> 23:10.080
Beatrice and Eugenie,
if you finally had the royal
safety net removed,

23:10.160 --> 23:12.120
like your mummy did,
maybe you could come up

23:12.200 --> 23:14.040
with some sort of
viable online business.

23:14.920 --> 23:17.560
Harry, could go back
into the Army again,

23:18.120 --> 23:20.080
or get a job at a fair
on the bumper cars.

23:21.800 --> 23:24.840
Camilla, you could work
in an off-license.

23:26.280 --> 23:28.280
Dad, what
would you like to be?

23:28.520 --> 23:30.160
-Beekeeper!
-Oh, why the hell not?

23:30.240 --> 23:31.920
You don't mind getting
strung occasionally.

23:32.040 --> 23:33.400
Oh, well...
Well, actually...

23:33.480 --> 23:37.120
Edward, you've suffered
most of all
from being a royal,

23:37.840 --> 23:39.800
but if you were
just a normal bloke,
people would finally stop

23:39.880 --> 23:42.240
mentioning the debacle
that was
<i>It's A Royal Knockout.</i>

23:43.160 --> 23:45.840
And even if none of it
worked out,
we could all just live off

23:45.920 --> 23:48.280
the interest
from our vast
personal fortunes!

23:49.720 --> 23:52.240
So, Prime Minister,
do your worst,

23:52.400 --> 23:53.880
because we are the Windsors.
