00:01.001 --> 00:02.877
Previously on
Secrets of Sulphur Springs…

00:02.961 --> 00:04.939
I'm your great-granddaughter,
and you traveled through time.

00:04.963 --> 00:08.049
You need to be me, and I'll go back
and be you just for a little while.

00:08.133 --> 00:09.259
Harper! Come on!

00:09.342 --> 00:10.593
Go! Be me!

00:10.677 --> 00:12.303
I step in, pretend I'm her,

00:12.387 --> 00:14.556
and figure out why
Grace wants us back here.

00:15.056 --> 00:17.058
Something was following me
back in the woods.

00:17.142 --> 00:19.227
Honey, that was Sam,
the maintenance man.

00:19.310 --> 00:22.022
Daisy! You 'bout scared me to death.

00:22.105 --> 00:23.940
You're trying to build
a time machine?

00:24.024 --> 00:25.525
Do you believe in time travel, Harry?

00:25.608 --> 00:28.153
This is the perfect opportunity
to get you back to 1930.

00:28.236 --> 00:29.476
But we have to leave right now.

00:39.164 --> 00:40.165
What the...

00:42.375 --> 00:43.793
But it was just here!

00:45.962 --> 00:47.255
Oh, no!

01:17.702 --> 01:19.342
It's almost 5:00.
Harper's waiting for us.

01:19.371 --> 01:20.372
We have to hurry.

01:20.455 --> 01:21.456
I'm coming.

01:44.396 --> 01:47.023
- No, no, no, no, this can't be happening.
- What's wrong?

01:47.107 --> 01:49.275
I don't know. It's never done this before.

01:49.359 --> 01:51.403
Come on.

01:52.070 --> 01:53.154
Oh, come on!

01:56.908 --> 02:00.370
I don't understand.
My family's radio is a time machine?

02:00.453 --> 02:02.038
Yeah, I mean, at least it was.

02:02.122 --> 02:05.583
Usually, we would just press this button
and then flip the dial, but…

02:10.046 --> 02:11.047
Oh, no!

02:11.131 --> 02:14.592
- What?
- There used to be a crystal thing here.

02:14.676 --> 02:17.178
- A crystal thing?
- It's like a glowing rock.

02:17.262 --> 02:21.349
It's gone. And until we find it…

02:23.268 --> 02:25.228
It looks like you're stuck here
being Harper.

02:26.062 --> 02:29.441
Griffin, no! I can't!
Papa and Sam depend on me.

02:29.524 --> 02:31.526
- Do you think someone took it?
- Maybe.

02:32.068 --> 02:35.447
Besides Harper and Savannah,
no one else even knows this place is here.

02:36.364 --> 02:37.657
Unless it was the ghost.

02:38.700 --> 02:40.076
Come on.

02:41.244 --> 02:42.328
Wait! The what?

03:09.731 --> 03:11.649
It'll be fine.
Whatever you normally do,

03:11.733 --> 03:13.794
Harper will cover for you
until you guys switch back.

03:13.818 --> 03:16.821
Yes, but even if she can be me,
I can't be her.

03:16.905 --> 03:18.591
Of course, you can.
You pulled it off earlier.

03:18.615 --> 03:21.868
Yes. With your help.
And what was that you just said about...

03:21.951 --> 03:22.952
Here.

03:24.746 --> 03:26.664
- What's this?
- It's Harper's clothes.

03:26.748 --> 03:28.708
Once you put 'em on,
you'll look exactly like her.

03:28.792 --> 03:31.795
And as far as being alone, you won't be.

03:32.671 --> 03:34.047
'Cause now that you have this…

03:36.424 --> 03:37.842
I'll be right there with you.

03:38.843 --> 03:42.806
What is... Griffin, no!
This is all too much. I can't...

03:43.348 --> 03:47.060
- And what were you saying about a ghost?
- Oh, right! About that…

03:50.522 --> 03:54.192
- My mother's mirror?
- Yeah, but it's more than that.

03:55.235 --> 03:57.112
It's how she communicates with us.

03:57.195 --> 04:01.658
- Who? The ghost?
- It's not just any ghost. It's…

04:03.201 --> 04:04.911
Well, it's y-your mother.

04:05.870 --> 04:10.000
What? Griffin, that... that's impossible.
No. No, it's crazy.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.501
Crazier than time travel?

04:17.590 --> 04:19.050
I think she wants to help us.

04:20.051 --> 04:21.678
Maybe if you ask her something.

04:26.891 --> 04:31.730
Mother, if that's really you, please…

04:31.813 --> 04:33.565
I have to get back to Papa and Sam.

04:34.232 --> 04:35.734
Do you know where the crystal is?

04:45.577 --> 04:49.456
Home? Yes, that's where I'm trying to go.

04:50.415 --> 04:51.499
It doesn't make any sense.

04:51.583 --> 04:55.337
If she knows the crystal's missing,
she has to know I'm stuck here, right?

04:55.420 --> 04:57.589
Yeah, but…

04:59.132 --> 05:01.092
What if that's not what she's saying?

05:01.176 --> 05:03.803
I mean, she knows
you're staying at Harper's.

05:04.888 --> 05:06.723
Maybe that's where she wants us to go.

05:40.590 --> 05:43.843
Didn't anyone ever tell you
it was bad manners to spy on folks?

05:45.136 --> 05:47.514
Greg! Hi.

05:48.056 --> 05:49.057
I was just...

05:49.140 --> 05:50.642
Well, I saw what you were doing.

05:50.725 --> 05:53.478
And, frankly, I don't think
Sam would appreciate it.

05:53.561 --> 05:55.355
You're right. Sorry.

05:55.438 --> 05:57.941
Guess my curious nature
gets the best of me sometimes.

05:58.024 --> 05:59.464
I should probably work on that, huh?

05:59.526 --> 06:01.111
Mmm. Might be a good idea.

06:01.611 --> 06:03.321
And I think your mom and dad would agree.

06:04.072 --> 06:05.949
Excellent point. See ya.

06:08.368 --> 06:09.744
You forgettin' somethin'?

06:25.260 --> 06:26.636
What do you think?

06:27.137 --> 06:29.681
Third coat really brought out
the grain in that oak, huh?

06:30.181 --> 06:31.766
Yeah. Yeah, really did.

06:32.350 --> 06:34.728
I gotta say,
I'm feeling pretty handy these days.

06:34.811 --> 06:37.147
Think I might even build
a new deck out back.

06:37.230 --> 06:40.775
Hot tub, maybe a…
You know, maybe a waterslide.

06:43.528 --> 06:44.738
I'm kidding.

06:45.280 --> 06:47.157
Uh, sorry.

06:48.283 --> 06:50.160
Guess I'm just feeling a little, um…

06:50.243 --> 06:51.453
Overwhelmed?

06:52.620 --> 06:53.621
Scared.

06:54.956 --> 06:55.957
I get it.

06:56.916 --> 07:00.795
- Money's a little tight right now, but...
- That's not what I'm talking about, Ben.

07:02.339 --> 07:05.383
I'm sorry, I-I tried to shake it but I...

07:06.885 --> 07:12.265
I can't get past this feeling that
someone or something is trying to...

07:15.101 --> 07:17.771
Griffin,
what did we tell you about the door?

07:17.854 --> 07:19.564
Oh, sorry, I forgot.

07:20.065 --> 07:21.066
Where have you been?

07:21.733 --> 07:23.693
Harper's house. Why?

07:24.819 --> 07:29.199
Well, you haven't been
down in the basement lately, have you?

07:30.075 --> 07:35.580
Not since Dad and I moved the mirror
down there yesterday.

07:36.873 --> 07:39.542
A decision I'm starting to regret.

07:40.502 --> 07:43.129
Yeah, we caught Wyatt and Zoey
down there earlier.

07:44.089 --> 07:46.132
- Really?
- Yeah.

07:46.216 --> 07:48.259
So if you wouldn't mind
setting a good example...

07:48.343 --> 07:50.345
No more basement! Okay?

07:51.096 --> 07:54.015
Of course. Yeah, I-I get it.

07:55.016 --> 07:56.893
I'll just be upstairs if you need me.

08:03.483 --> 08:06.319
- What is it, anyway?
- Guess it's some kind of rock.

08:06.986 --> 08:10.532
So, that's it?
It doesn't light up or move or anything?

08:10.615 --> 08:11.783
Try shaking it.

08:11.866 --> 08:13.785
Put it down now!

08:15.704 --> 08:17.288
Oh, um…

08:17.372 --> 08:21.084
- Griffin! What the heck?
- Sorry, I-I thought you guys were…

08:22.502 --> 08:23.503
Never mind.

08:24.838 --> 08:29.676
- So, what game are you playing?
- It's not a game. It's a spirit board.

08:29.759 --> 08:32.804
We're trying to contact the ghost
who pulled down the wallpaper.

08:32.887 --> 08:35.849
We might be doing it wrong, though.
We couldn't find the instructions.

08:35.932 --> 08:39.060
- Cool.
- What did you think we were doing?

08:39.686 --> 08:43.148
Oh, I, uh... I thought you, uh…

08:44.274 --> 08:46.359
You know what? I forgot, actually.

08:46.943 --> 08:48.236
It's kind of weird, huh?

08:49.195 --> 08:50.321
Very weird.

08:51.072 --> 08:53.199
Yeah, I know. Uh, sorry.

08:53.283 --> 08:56.286
Well, good luck on
your guys' board thingy.

08:58.413 --> 08:59.414
He forgot?

09:00.123 --> 09:02.959
Probably hormones.
Teenagers are totally bizarre.

09:06.421 --> 09:09.257
I can't be stuck here.
I've got to get home.

09:09.758 --> 09:12.594
It's okay,
they're just running late, that's all.

09:12.677 --> 09:15.597
I just wish there was a way...

09:41.873 --> 09:43.124
Harper, is that you?

09:44.376 --> 09:46.586
Yes, it is I... Me.

09:47.837 --> 09:48.880
Harper.

09:50.131 --> 09:51.257
Glad I caught you.

09:53.343 --> 09:54.344
Where's Griffin?

09:55.345 --> 09:58.765
He had to go home, I suppose.

09:58.848 --> 10:02.102
Eh. It's probably for the best.
Taco night's gonna have to wait.

10:02.185 --> 10:04.020
The walk-in at the café broke again.

10:04.104 --> 10:06.272
So I'm meeting the technician now,

10:06.356 --> 10:08.274
and that means
you're gonna have to make dinner.

10:09.234 --> 10:12.070
Dinner? Are you sure that's necessary?

10:12.737 --> 10:15.990
Well, it's not like
I'm asking you to cook a four-course meal.

10:16.074 --> 10:17.492
There's lasagna in the freezer.

10:17.575 --> 10:20.328
Just zap it in the microwave
for ten minutes.

10:20.412 --> 10:23.456
Microwave for ten minutes. Got it!

10:23.540 --> 10:24.582
Thanks.

10:25.208 --> 10:28.962
And could you please go up and tell Topher
to stop goofing around on his laptop

10:29.045 --> 10:31.297
and finish his Language Arts homework,
now?

10:31.381 --> 10:34.509
Stop goofing around on his "lapftop."

10:35.093 --> 10:36.594
"Lapftop"?

10:37.220 --> 10:40.015
I'm sorry, I meant… I mean…

10:42.308 --> 10:44.019
Harper, are you feeling okay?

10:45.437 --> 10:47.564
Yes. I think I'm just…

10:49.107 --> 10:51.109
- I'm…
- Having a rough day?

10:53.278 --> 10:56.740
Aw, baby. We all have those.

11:02.245 --> 11:03.413
Thank you.

11:05.957 --> 11:07.667
That's what moms are for, right?

11:07.751 --> 11:09.377
I'll be no more than an hour.

11:22.849 --> 11:26.311
Stop goofing around on your laptop.

11:27.479 --> 11:29.272
Laptop.

11:38.698 --> 11:40.367
Hey! What are you doing?

11:40.450 --> 11:43.286
I'm supposed to be the one
who enters without knocking.

11:43.370 --> 11:45.622
I'm sorry. No one told me that.

11:47.332 --> 11:49.626
- What?
- Never mind. Um…

11:50.794 --> 11:55.757
Mother told me to tell you
to stop goofing around on your laptop.

11:55.840 --> 11:59.177
Seriously? Man, how does she do it?

12:00.136 --> 12:01.179
What?

12:01.262 --> 12:04.474
How does Mom always know
what I'm doing, even when she's not here?

12:05.058 --> 12:06.226
Gives me the creeps.

12:07.352 --> 12:10.522
Well, some women in our family
do have the sight.

12:10.605 --> 12:12.023
The sight?

12:12.107 --> 12:14.859
They're seers.
They see things before they happen.

12:15.527 --> 12:17.153
What kind of things?

12:17.987 --> 12:21.074
Bad things, usually. Really bad.

13:07.495 --> 13:09.789
Best thing about
sending a letter to the future?

13:10.331 --> 13:11.374
No stamp.

13:30.352 --> 13:33.772
"Guys, help. I'm stuck in 1930."

13:39.986 --> 13:41.279
Oh, my gosh!

13:42.489 --> 13:43.698
Harper!

14:10.100 --> 14:11.101
Grace?

14:34.249 --> 14:35.583
"Get this, Moss Man is real.

14:35.667 --> 14:37.347
He's the maintenance man
here at the hotel,

14:37.377 --> 14:39.921
and I just saw him coming out
of the secret room in the parlor.

14:40.422 --> 14:42.173
He's definitely up to something.

14:42.257 --> 14:45.343
Hope to know more next time I see you.
Savannah."

14:47.512 --> 14:48.805
No way.

14:54.060 --> 14:57.272
- Daisy, did you find the crystal?
- I've barely had any time to look.

14:57.355 --> 14:59.774
Mrs. Dunn asked me to cook
some strange food for supper,

14:59.858 --> 15:01.735
and now I can't even remember what it was.

15:01.818 --> 15:05.613
So? I mean, you live on a farm,
you must know how to cook something.

15:05.697 --> 15:07.949
Of course.
I cook for Papa and Sam every day,

15:08.033 --> 15:11.661
but I don't know how to use
anything in here.

15:11.745 --> 15:13.955
Well, sure you do. How about the oven?

15:14.539 --> 15:15.915
Yes, I see it.

15:15.999 --> 15:18.501
Great. Uh, now open the fridge.

15:18.585 --> 15:21.713
That's the big silver box over there.

15:21.796 --> 15:23.757
And cook the first thing you find.

15:25.008 --> 15:27.093
Oh, my! Okay.

15:27.177 --> 15:29.262
I think I can do that. Then what?

15:29.346 --> 15:32.932
The only thing that matters,
find the crystal.

15:39.647 --> 15:43.651
You gonna keep staring into that thing?
Or are you gonna start supper?

15:44.944 --> 15:46.529
I'm working on it, okay?

15:48.281 --> 15:51.659
This biscuit recipe calls for milk,
but I guess we're out.

15:52.160 --> 15:55.080
- Maybe we can call Papa and ask him...
- Call Papa?

15:55.747 --> 15:58.041
How we gonna do that?
Holler out the window?

16:01.002 --> 16:05.298
Sorry, I meant, um, where can I find milk?

16:06.007 --> 16:07.300
Where do you think?

16:10.428 --> 16:16.518
Okay, Sadie, this is totally new for me.
So if I do anything wrong, just bleat.

16:17.477 --> 16:19.312
And I'm sorry if my hands are cold.

16:24.609 --> 16:26.277
Sadie, you're a lifesaver.

16:29.739 --> 16:34.369
Okay. A double.
A little late in the day, isn't it?

16:34.452 --> 16:37.038
Yeah. I just haven't been
sleeping that well lately.

16:37.122 --> 16:39.290
Please tell me
it's not more creepy humming.

16:39.374 --> 16:41.167
No. Thankfully not.

16:42.127 --> 16:43.128
Well, what's going on?

16:44.546 --> 16:46.548
Just a lot of little things, I guess.

16:46.631 --> 16:48.471
Every time I try to tell myself
it's nothing...

16:53.847 --> 16:56.182
- What's going on?
- I have no idea. They just...

16:56.266 --> 16:57.559
It's her! It's her!

16:57.642 --> 16:59.310
- Who?
- The ghost.

16:59.394 --> 17:02.272
The lady we saw through the window.
We told you about her!

17:02.355 --> 17:03.395
But you didn't believe us!

17:03.440 --> 17:06.693
Okay, this is going to end now.
You can't just go around yelling...

17:06.776 --> 17:09.612
Her name is Mrs. Barker.
She's here at least once a week.

17:09.696 --> 17:11.823
She's definitely not a ghost.

17:11.906 --> 17:13.825
Jess, we are so sorry.

17:14.492 --> 17:15.493
Right, guys?

17:15.994 --> 17:17.162
Sorry.

17:17.245 --> 17:18.496
Yeah, sorry.

17:19.330 --> 17:20.957
It's okay. I get it.

17:21.041 --> 17:23.501
I've got my own little paranormal hunter
at home.

17:30.967 --> 17:34.012
Delicious! What is this called again?

17:34.095 --> 17:35.597
Creamed chicken and toast.

17:35.680 --> 17:38.308
Huh. When did you learn how to cook?

17:40.185 --> 17:43.772
Last week, I watched you burn
frozen egg rolls. Twice!

17:44.731 --> 17:46.191
It's not that hard.

17:46.274 --> 17:48.002
I just used some things
I found in the kitchen.

17:48.026 --> 17:51.154
Come on, how'd you really do it?

17:51.237 --> 17:54.157
Must have some new recipe app
on your phone, right?

17:54.240 --> 17:55.700
My phone?

17:56.534 --> 17:59.454
- This has recipes?
- Only like a billion of 'em.

18:00.872 --> 18:05.418
Man! And just when I thought
we were having frozen lasagna again.

18:05.502 --> 18:07.754
- Mmm.
- Lasagna.

18:11.174 --> 18:13.593
Saw Hoyt Sanders
at the post office this morning.

18:14.552 --> 18:16.721
Told me Molly's about
to start the fourth grade.

18:17.222 --> 18:20.016
Fourth grade, huh?
I always did like Molly.

18:20.642 --> 18:23.770
That's good to hear,
'cause you might be seeing her again soon.

18:23.853 --> 18:24.896
How's that?

18:25.397 --> 18:28.441
I believe it might be time for you
to start back at school in the fall.

18:28.942 --> 18:31.027
- Both of you.
- School?

18:31.611 --> 18:33.196
But who's gonna help with the chores?

18:33.279 --> 18:34.739
This place is a lot of work.

18:34.823 --> 18:38.618
And Mother always said
you're not a young man anymore.

18:40.704 --> 18:41.955
Your mother had a point.

18:42.831 --> 18:44.874
But your education was important to her.

18:46.918 --> 18:47.919
Come on, now.

18:48.670 --> 18:51.965
I haven't made the decision yet.
Just thinking about it, that's all.

18:57.679 --> 18:58.763
Oh, no!

19:07.731 --> 19:10.316
I'm so sorry.
I have no idea how this happened.

19:10.400 --> 19:13.069
It's all right, Daisy.
Just a little burned soup.

19:13.153 --> 19:16.322
But I turned off that burner.
I know I did.

19:17.198 --> 19:19.617
Well, memory can be
a tricky thing sometimes.

19:20.452 --> 19:22.579
Now the two of you
get started on these dishes.

19:22.662 --> 19:25.582
That old pot needs to soak for a while.

19:52.108 --> 19:53.818
…state of matter.

19:59.074 --> 20:00.367
Hmm…

20:30.730 --> 20:33.233
Why would Moss Man
be in the secret room?

20:47.247 --> 20:48.331
Sam?

20:53.420 --> 20:55.231
Griffin, I tried to search Topher's room,
but I...

20:55.255 --> 20:56.589
No, it's okay. Listen.

20:56.673 --> 20:59.753
My friend Savannah just sent me a picture
and I need you to take a look at it.

21:00.135 --> 21:01.177
What is it a picture of?

21:01.261 --> 21:04.264
It's the maintenance man
at the hotel in 1962.

21:04.347 --> 21:05.974
I think his name's Sam.

21:06.808 --> 21:09.978
- Sam? Like my brother?
- Exactly!

21:10.061 --> 21:13.356
And it may just be a coincidence, but…

21:14.816 --> 21:16.109
It could be him.

21:16.192 --> 21:19.237
But why is he working
as a maintenance man in 1962?

21:19.320 --> 21:20.321
No idea.

21:20.405 --> 21:22.198
But he's an inventor, right?

21:22.282 --> 21:24.576
I mean,
I saw him on that crazy bike thing.

21:24.659 --> 21:27.829
And he's into time travel,
H.G. Wells, that kind of stuff.

21:27.912 --> 21:30.415
Yes, that's my brother. Why?

21:30.498 --> 21:34.336
Well, what if somehow
he's the key to all of this?

21:40.175 --> 21:42.427
Sam. Everything okay?

21:43.636 --> 21:46.931
Yeah. Guess I'm just thinking
about what Papa said.

21:47.015 --> 21:49.517
You know, about selling this place?

21:50.185 --> 21:53.063
He just said he was thinking about it.
Are you worried?

21:54.105 --> 21:55.106
Yeah.

21:56.524 --> 21:57.817
But not for me.

21:59.027 --> 22:00.028
For you.

22:00.945 --> 22:01.988
What do you mean?

22:03.073 --> 22:04.491
Our plan, remember?

22:06.826 --> 22:09.871
I'm gonna travel the galaxy
like those fellas in my books

22:09.954 --> 22:12.874
while you stay here and tend the farm.

22:13.958 --> 22:15.627
That's still your dream, right?

22:15.710 --> 22:18.838
Yeah! Yeah, of course! I'm just...

22:18.922 --> 22:20.674
Um…

22:22.759 --> 22:24.302
Sam, something happened today.

22:24.844 --> 22:26.554
I had this vision.

22:28.556 --> 22:29.557
Vision?

22:30.141 --> 22:33.853
I'm in a room, but I can't tell where I am
because there's so much smoke.

22:34.688 --> 22:37.607
Smoke? Like the burned soup earlier?

22:38.566 --> 22:39.693
Maybe.

22:42.320 --> 22:44.989
Oh, my gosh!
Daisy, you know what this means.

22:45.073 --> 22:47.450
- What?
- You've got the sight!

22:48.368 --> 22:50.870
- The sight?
- You're a seer.

22:51.788 --> 22:53.123
Just like Mother.

22:54.290 --> 22:58.169
Of course,
she always said it skipped a generation.

22:58.253 --> 23:03.883
So, it wouldn't pass on to you,
only your daughter if you ever had one.

23:05.677 --> 23:07.095
Guess she was wrong.

23:08.013 --> 23:11.641
So, what do you think it meant?
The vision, I mean.

23:13.226 --> 23:14.352
Beats me.

23:14.436 --> 23:17.188
But like Mother always said
when she had one…

23:19.232 --> 23:20.817
it's never anything good.

23:22.027 --> 23:24.612
And is usually a lot worse
than a burned pot.

23:44.341 --> 23:46.676
Hang on, Harper. I'm coming.

23:49.971 --> 23:51.056
Oh, come on!

23:51.765 --> 23:53.350
Please work, please work.

23:53.433 --> 23:55.101
Who said you could touch that?

23:56.895 --> 23:58.104
Sam.

24:06.071 --> 24:09.115
Stupid rock! Just like that movie.

24:12.452 --> 24:13.870
No!

24:29.386 --> 24:32.180
Next time on
Secrets of Sulphur Springs…

24:32.263 --> 24:34.450
There might be a way
we could get the portal working again.

24:34.474 --> 24:35.534
A way that involves your brother.

24:35.558 --> 24:37.078
We just need to find out
how he did it.

24:37.143 --> 24:38.978
I know what this radio
really is.

24:39.062 --> 24:40.206
You're building a time machine.

24:40.230 --> 24:42.124
You have to go to school
to maintain cover as Harper.

24:42.148 --> 24:43.868
Couldn't have changed that much
in 90 years.

24:43.900 --> 24:45.235
It has to be here somewhere.

24:45.318 --> 24:47.153
You've been acting so strange lately.

24:47.237 --> 24:49.280
Sometimes, I don't know who to trust.

24:49.364 --> 24:52.867
If we want more information on ectoplasm,
we need to find experts.

24:52.951 --> 24:54.411
Hello?

24:55.286 --> 24:56.329
To be continued.
