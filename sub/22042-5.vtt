WEBVTT

00:02.596 --> 00:04.744
to save a dog friendly Vermont inn.

00:04.744 --> 00:07.145
Does that look like a floating turd?

00:08.664 --> 00:10.301
That isn't friendly to dogs.

00:10.301 --> 00:11.323
They're cramped and bare.

00:11.323 --> 00:12.376
It looks like a prison

00:12.376 --> 00:14.170
Or to humans.

00:14.170 --> 00:16.363
Now this black light
shows up bodily fluids.

00:16.363 --> 00:17.231
- [Crowd] What?

00:17.231 --> 00:19.050
Oh right there.

00:19.050 --> 00:21.438
- [Gordon] With the owner
barking up the wrong tree.

00:21.438 --> 00:23.085
- Water, food, get it outta here.

00:23.085 --> 00:24.034
Fuck you, Steve.

00:24.034 --> 00:26.255
- [Gordon] And the
staff ready to run away.

00:26.255 --> 00:27.173
- Where's my money?

00:27.173 --> 00:28.080
- No-one gets paid.

00:28.080 --> 00:29.331
- [Gordon] This dog friendly inn is

00:29.331 --> 00:31.333
on its way to be put down for good.

00:31.333 --> 00:33.408
I've just never seen this
shit going on before.

00:33.408 --> 00:35.806
- [Sandy] I'm ready to
burn the building down.

00:37.715 --> 00:41.104
(energetic rock music)

01:02.854 --> 01:05.179
- [Gordon] The Four Seasons
Inn is located in West Dover

01:05.179 --> 01:07.525
in Vermont's beautiful green mountains.

01:07.525 --> 01:09.997
former construction worker
Sandy MacDougall purchased

01:09.997 --> 01:12.897
the inn, which has 14 bedrooms
and an adjacent kennel

01:12.897 --> 01:16.128
as the culmination of a lifelong dream.

01:16.128 --> 01:19.162
- Since I was a kid I've
always wanted to own an inn.

01:19.162 --> 01:20.924
Always wanted to be able to please people

01:20.924 --> 01:23.218
and give them a happy experience.

01:23.218 --> 01:26.226
- That smell really
does me in a little bit.

01:26.226 --> 01:27.095
- Yeah.

01:29.162 --> 01:30.236
- A hair was found.

01:30.236 --> 01:31.104
- A what?

01:31.104 --> 01:32.008
- [Waiter] A dog hair.

01:32.008 --> 01:33.082
- A dog hair?

01:33.082 --> 01:34.410
- Impossible.

01:36.335 --> 01:39.985
- This is a dream come
true, it's a beautiful inn.

01:39.985 --> 01:42.873
It's a great place, it's
a little slice of heaven.

01:42.873 --> 01:43.742
- [Guest] I don't know what kind

01:43.742 --> 01:45.824
of stain that is but I
don't want to lay in it.

01:45.824 --> 01:48.754
- Or I thought it was.

01:48.754 --> 01:50.495
- [Gordon] After only two years Sandy's

01:50.495 --> 01:52.529
slice of heaven has turned into hell.

01:52.529 --> 01:54.593
- I don't know why the
phones are not working.

01:54.593 --> 01:56.658
It's been nothing but haemorrhaging money.

01:56.658 --> 01:58.848
- [Gordon] The inn's bedrooms
are almost always empty

01:58.848 --> 01:59.920
and despite marketing itself as

01:59.920 --> 02:03.279
a dog-friendly hotel
their kennel lies unused.

02:03.279 --> 02:05.072
- Current standing into the inn

02:05.072 --> 02:09.660
cash-wise 1.15 million
dollars out of my butt.

02:11.071 --> 02:13.894
- That's terrific, I'm glad
I was able to help with that.

02:13.894 --> 02:15.936
- Richard's my marketing
director, I should be

02:15.936 --> 02:19.580
beating the hell out of him
every day because he sucks.

02:19.580 --> 02:20.448
- Richard.

02:20.448 --> 02:21.318
- What's up?

02:21.318 --> 02:23.098
- [Gordon] With no money
coming in the inn survives

02:23.098 --> 02:25.332
with just a skeleton crew who live

02:25.332 --> 02:28.273
in the inn for free instead
of receiving a salary.

02:28.273 --> 02:31.224
- And I drink, I don't get
paid so it's not really a job.

02:31.224 --> 02:34.219
It's more volunteering,
I wouldn't call it a job.

02:36.322 --> 02:37.417
- Where's my money?

02:37.417 --> 02:38.286
I want my money.

02:38.286 --> 02:40.483
- I'm not getting paid,
I've hit rock bottom.

02:40.483 --> 02:42.485
As of this morning I'm
officially maxed out

02:42.485 --> 02:45.441
on three cards and 14
dollars in my bank account.

02:45.441 --> 02:47.156
- Lock that door.

02:47.156 --> 02:52.370
Sandy is generally a nice guy
but staff does not get paid.

02:55.023 --> 02:57.010
- [Guest] This is terrible

02:57.010 --> 03:00.409
- There is endless
complaints about everything.

03:00.409 --> 03:01.504
- [Guest] It kind of reminds me

03:01.504 --> 03:03.840
of the nursing home I worked at.

03:03.840 --> 03:05.894
- That's why we get paid the big dollars.

03:05.894 --> 03:07.124
Fuck you Steve.

03:07.124 --> 03:09.512
- Sandy's own worst enemy is Sandy.

03:09.512 --> 03:11.819
- [Sandy] Why the hell is the grill off?

03:13.401 --> 03:15.706
- [Gordon] Sandy's best
friend is his dog Layla

03:15.706 --> 03:17.259
who lives with him at the inn.

03:17.259 --> 03:20.231
- Layla is an English
Setter, she's the greeter.

03:20.231 --> 03:23.676
She'll come in the dining
room, she'll sit at your feet.

03:23.676 --> 03:25.987
- The guests complain
about dog hair everywhere

03:25.987 --> 03:28.760
and it makes them feel disgusting.

03:28.760 --> 03:30.835
- Dogs have hair, dogs have dander.

03:30.835 --> 03:31.951
Dogs drool.

03:31.951 --> 03:35.350
I mean, dogs lick their own butt.

03:35.350 --> 03:38.697
You don't want them
anywhere around the kitchen.

03:38.697 --> 03:40.647
- [Gordon] Most days there
are more rooms occupied

03:40.647 --> 03:43.212
by the staff than guests and
if things don't turn around

03:43.212 --> 03:46.507
soon this dog-friendly inn
will have to be put to sleep.

03:46.507 --> 03:50.183
- Sandy is ragged, beaten, we all are.

03:50.183 --> 03:52.865
If Gordon can't save this place

03:52.865 --> 03:55.892
the Four Seasons Inn is proper fucked.

03:55.892 --> 03:57.417
- I can't let this hotel go.

04:00.031 --> 04:02.502
- He's running out of time,
he's running out of money

04:02.502 --> 04:04.233
and he's running out of energy.

04:04.233 --> 04:06.694
- This is the death rattle, this is it.

04:06.694 --> 04:09.304
- Good God I can't be
that screwed up, am I?

04:14.316 --> 04:15.651
- This is exciting.

04:15.651 --> 04:18.935
I'm back in Vermont heading
towards the Four Seasons Inn.

04:18.935 --> 04:21.269
Trust me I've stayed in
a lot of crappy hotels

04:21.269 --> 04:22.950
and I'm finally getting to stay

04:22.950 --> 04:26.985
in something sumptuous and
amazing, the Four Seasons Inn.

04:26.985 --> 04:29.237
I've stayed at Four
Seasons all over the world.

04:29.237 --> 04:31.511
They're fabulous hotels that define luxury

04:31.511 --> 04:33.484
so this week should be a dream.

04:36.943 --> 04:37.812
Hello?

04:39.873 --> 04:40.752
Oh God.

04:41.917 --> 04:44.422
Well it certainly doesn't look
like a Four Seasons to me.

04:46.218 --> 04:47.162
Oh Jesus.

04:47.162 --> 04:48.030
Hello?

04:48.030 --> 04:49.497
I was hoping for a dream but this

04:49.497 --> 04:51.575
place looks like another nightmare.

04:58.121 --> 04:59.181
- How are you Gordon?

04:59.181 --> 05:00.050
- And first name is?

05:00.050 --> 05:00.918
- It's Gordon.

05:00.918 --> 05:02.545
- I know what my name is, thank you.

05:02.545 --> 05:03.748
- My name is Sandy.

05:03.748 --> 05:05.430
- Did the receptionist call in sick?

05:05.430 --> 05:08.172
- No, she is around, I will
take care of that for you.

05:08.172 --> 05:10.946
- Okay great, happy to check in.

05:10.946 --> 05:14.971
- We have 18 rooms in the
inn, the rooms are beautiful.

05:14.971 --> 05:18.829
- What a fucking mess, nice
to see the bed's been made.

05:20.257 --> 05:23.146
- I'm surprised I'm still
standing after I opened that door.

05:23.146 --> 05:25.562
I swear to God I thought I
was going to shit myself.

05:25.562 --> 05:27.275
- Do you have a room
that is actually ready?

05:27.275 --> 05:28.526
- Yes, I do.

05:28.526 --> 05:29.412
- Thank you, sir.

05:33.135 --> 05:35.275
- Hey, a bit late for the old party.

05:36.272 --> 05:37.986
Sandy, hello?

05:39.120 --> 05:40.840
Oh well.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.978
- Really the one room they don't make up.

05:45.178 --> 05:46.116
Erin?

05:46.116 --> 05:46.985
- [Erin] Yeah?

05:49.099 --> 05:49.967
- Rotten.

05:49.967 --> 05:51.038
I am pissed off.

05:51.038 --> 05:52.742
Room four is done and ready to go?

05:52.742 --> 05:53.610
- Yes.

05:53.610 --> 05:54.479
- Go up and check.

05:54.479 --> 05:55.563
There is just no excuse for not getting

05:55.563 --> 05:57.388
the rooms done in a timely fashion.

05:58.608 --> 06:00.332
This is my worst nightmare.

06:02.226 --> 06:03.895
- Sandy?

06:03.895 --> 06:04.763
Sandy?

06:04.763 --> 06:05.762
Oh hello.

06:05.762 --> 06:06.631
- [Erin] Hi, how are you?

06:06.631 --> 06:07.784
- Yeah rather I was shown
to the honeymoon suite.

06:07.784 --> 06:09.176
- Oh okay I'm Erin, so--

06:09.176 --> 06:10.728
- And I've lost Sandy.

06:10.728 --> 06:11.596
- You what?

06:11.596 --> 06:12.945
- I've lost Sandy, it's a bit bizarre.

06:12.945 --> 06:14.958
- Sandy is very scared of his guests

06:14.958 --> 06:16.491
because he doesn't like it when people

06:16.491 --> 06:19.114
talk down about his inn or his food

06:19.114 --> 06:21.600
and stuff like that so
he hides in the kitchen.

06:21.600 --> 06:24.138
- He showed me into a room
that wasn't made and...

06:24.138 --> 06:25.579
- Yeah we're kind of in the
middle of doing all of them.

06:25.579 --> 06:28.225
- Oh there he is!

06:28.225 --> 06:29.643
And what do you do?

06:29.643 --> 06:31.047
I'm the housekeeper here and I do

06:31.047 --> 06:33.643
hula hoop instructing and also the...

06:33.643 --> 06:34.512
- Just say that again.

06:34.512 --> 06:36.021
- The hula hoop instructing?

06:36.021 --> 06:36.889
- Wow.

06:36.889 --> 06:37.953
- [Erin] Yeah.

06:37.953 --> 06:39.847
- And obviously a huge demand in

06:39.847 --> 06:41.787
Vermont for hula hoop dancers right?

06:41.787 --> 06:44.362
- Not at all here in Vermont but I kind

06:44.362 --> 06:45.961
of picked it up and I liked it so...

06:45.961 --> 06:47.292
- [Gordon] You got another room for me?

06:47.292 --> 06:48.161
- Yes I do.

06:48.161 --> 06:49.816
- [Gordon] Okay great.

06:49.816 --> 06:51.526
Hula hoop instructor, wow.

06:51.526 --> 06:52.725
Fuck me that's a first.

06:53.967 --> 06:56.896
Ah, at least the bed's made.

06:56.896 --> 06:58.314
- Thank God for that.

06:58.314 --> 07:02.124
- Thank you, wow, this wallpaper,
its eye-catching right?

07:02.124 --> 07:03.767
- It came with the place.

07:03.767 --> 07:06.530
- Right, I have to be honest.

07:06.530 --> 07:08.407
I've been very fortunate
enough to stay in lots

07:08.407 --> 07:10.691
of Four Seasons but I haven't
seen one quite like this.

07:10.691 --> 07:11.854
How long you been affiliated?

07:11.854 --> 07:14.513
- We're not affiliated,
we're the Four Seasons Inn.

07:16.506 --> 07:17.750
- Oh, so you're not a Four Seasons.

07:17.750 --> 07:19.283
- We're the Four Seasons Inn

07:19.283 --> 07:21.271
- But you're not a Four Seasons?

07:21.271 --> 07:23.537
- No, no affiliation.

07:23.537 --> 07:24.830
- Can you get away with that legally?

07:24.830 --> 07:27.207
- Yep, they call themselves
The Four Seasons.

07:27.207 --> 07:29.282
We're the Four Seasons Inn.

07:29.282 --> 07:30.450
- Incredible.

07:30.450 --> 07:33.659
And next month it's gonna be
the Waldorf Astoria Lodge.

07:33.659 --> 07:36.195
- No.

07:36.195 --> 07:39.094
- Well I'm going to unpack.

07:39.094 --> 07:39.963
- Thank you sir.

07:43.192 --> 07:44.060
- Fuck me.

07:45.225 --> 07:48.812
Four Seasons, yeah, more
like four shades of shit.

07:48.812 --> 07:49.901
Wow.

07:49.901 --> 07:52.952
(bell chiming)

07:52.952 --> 07:55.715
I've just found out that the
Four Seasons Inn is about

07:55.715 --> 07:58.742
as far away from a luxury
hotel as you can get.

07:59.698 --> 08:02.172
I need to find out what's
really going on here.

08:03.201 --> 08:04.070
How are you?

08:04.070 --> 08:04.939
- [Erin] I'm good.

08:04.939 --> 08:05.807
- So how long have you been here?

08:05.807 --> 08:06.757
- About five months.

08:06.757 --> 08:08.988
I came here to do like massage therapy

08:08.988 --> 08:10.459
and stuff but then we didn't have,

08:10.459 --> 08:12.033
like a, really, call for
it because it was slow

08:12.033 --> 08:14.379
so I just started housekeeping.

08:14.379 --> 08:15.787
- Do you ever stay here?

08:15.787 --> 08:16.656
- I do.

08:17.806 --> 08:18.674
- Oh you do?

08:18.674 --> 08:19.543
- Yeah I live here.

08:21.292 --> 08:23.659
- How does that work salary-wise?

08:23.659 --> 08:24.786
- I don't get one.

08:25.780 --> 08:27.799
- What do you mean you don't get one?

08:27.799 --> 08:28.977
- I've never gotten a paycheck.

08:28.977 --> 08:29.846
- You're joking?

08:29.846 --> 08:32.522
- No, I'm kind of scared
to ask him about it.

08:32.522 --> 08:35.765
I'm not too wicked excited
about not getting a paycheck

08:35.765 --> 08:37.381
but I don't have a full-on conversation

08:37.381 --> 08:39.436
with Sandy about it because I am scared

08:39.436 --> 08:40.374
that he is going to yell at me

08:40.374 --> 08:42.022
and I just don't want to take it.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.830
- God, so how can you treat this place

08:43.830 --> 08:46.463
professionally if you're not getting paid?

08:46.463 --> 08:47.408
- You can't really, I guess,
treat it professionally.

08:47.408 --> 08:49.841
- You can't no, bloody hell.

08:51.114 --> 08:52.285
- No-one gets paid.

08:53.199 --> 08:54.370
- What an embarrassment.

08:56.838 --> 08:59.445
I can't believe Sandy
doesn't pay his housekeeper.

09:00.571 --> 09:03.084
No wonder my room was such a mess.

09:03.084 --> 09:05.934
I hope the food here is
better than the rooms.

09:09.685 --> 09:12.482
It's lonely in here, where
the hell is everybody?

09:14.481 --> 09:15.350
Hello.

09:15.350 --> 09:17.536
- Hello my name is Gwen.

09:17.536 --> 09:19.596
- Gwen, nice to see you,
where did you pop out of?

09:19.596 --> 09:21.908
- Popped out of the kitchen.

09:23.041 --> 09:25.565
I'm going to get you started
with a glass of water here.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.455
Hi Layla.

09:28.380 --> 09:30.236
That's Layla she kind of runs the house

09:30.236 --> 09:31.999
here if you haven't met her yet.

09:31.999 --> 09:34.084
- Yeah, she seems busier than the owner.

09:36.013 --> 09:40.048
EntrÃ©es, I'll have the mushroom
ravioli, sounds delicious.

09:40.048 --> 09:41.070
Let's go for the salmon as well

09:41.070 --> 09:42.540
after that cooked with apples,

09:42.540 --> 09:45.460
finished with maple glaze
and an apple risotto.

09:45.460 --> 09:46.903
- You would like the apple risotto.

09:46.903 --> 09:47.772
- Okay, great.

09:47.772 --> 09:48.713
- All right.

09:48.713 --> 09:49.891
(Layla growling)

09:49.891 --> 09:52.133
- [Sandy] She's placing
an order, man them up.

09:52.133 --> 09:53.729
- I'm so nervous I'm trying not to puke.

09:53.729 --> 09:55.293
I puked last night before service

09:55.293 --> 09:58.911
and after service and I'll
probably do the same tonight.

09:58.911 --> 10:01.865
- Apple risotto with the
salmon, salmon seared.

10:03.363 --> 10:04.406
- I think we're going to knock

10:04.406 --> 10:06.329
Gordon's socks off with the food.

10:06.329 --> 10:08.064
Fantastic.

10:08.064 --> 10:10.829
- All right, well we
have some bread for you.

10:10.829 --> 10:11.830
What do you think?

10:11.830 --> 10:15.170
- Yeah disgusting, it's
just so heavy and doughy.

10:16.543 --> 10:19.473
Hey will you eat it?

10:19.473 --> 10:22.166
Curry bread, you'll eat anything.

10:24.395 --> 10:26.689
- Gordon did not approve
of the curry bread.

10:28.868 --> 10:29.737
- Oh lord.

10:29.737 --> 10:31.746
- Sandy being a business owner with

10:31.746 --> 10:34.348
no culinary experience
or training in any way.

10:34.348 --> 10:36.042
That's what I was saying
last night, it's doughy.

10:36.042 --> 10:39.118
I don't feel that he should be
back in the kitchen working.

10:42.642 --> 10:43.595
- Layla...

10:43.595 --> 10:45.492
Oh shit, I thought you were gone.

10:46.427 --> 10:49.402
Stay with me girl, it's only curry bread.

10:50.337 --> 10:54.390
I'm hoping these next couple
of dishes are at least edible.

10:57.181 --> 10:58.397
- Send it.

10:58.397 --> 11:00.368
- Flavour, flavour.

11:00.368 --> 11:03.341
- I'm sure there's going to
be a lot of flavour here.

11:03.341 --> 11:04.210
- Jesus, what is that?

11:04.210 --> 11:05.574
- [Gwen] Mushroom ravioli.

11:06.689 --> 11:08.241
- Did the dog just throw up on my plate?

11:08.241 --> 11:09.283
- [Gwen] I hope not.

11:10.201 --> 11:11.779
- Wow, Jesus, God.

11:14.552 --> 11:15.595
- How is it?

11:17.831 --> 11:19.185
- Weird.

11:19.185 --> 11:23.095
The pasta is undercooked,
bizarre, thank you.

11:24.958 --> 11:25.942
- [Gwen] Sorry.

11:25.942 --> 11:27.802
- No it's not you fault.

11:27.802 --> 11:29.803
What's the main problems with this place?

11:29.803 --> 11:31.545
- Management.

11:31.545 --> 11:33.516
- I mean, the management is Sandy right?

11:33.516 --> 11:37.121
- Yeah, I've worked for him
and haven't received checks.

11:37.121 --> 11:41.138
- Oh wow, the staff have
worked hard and not been paid.

11:41.138 --> 11:42.181
- Yeah.

11:42.181 --> 11:45.205
- Wow, Jeez that's tough.

11:45.205 --> 11:50.418
- Sandy can be extremely
hard to work with and for.

11:50.940 --> 11:53.362
Bizarre and weird.

11:54.683 --> 11:56.977
- Good God, can this get any worse?

11:56.977 --> 11:58.781
- He said it's undercooked.

11:58.781 --> 11:59.823
- Okay.

11:59.823 --> 12:02.044
All food in-house right now that is coming

12:02.044 --> 12:04.589
off this menu, none of it is local.

12:04.589 --> 12:08.919
None of it is fresh,
Sandy's menu is garbage.

12:11.418 --> 12:12.795
- Hello Gordon, good afternoon.

12:12.795 --> 12:13.663
- Customer, right?

12:13.663 --> 12:14.532
- Richard.

12:14.532 --> 12:15.568
- Oh Richard, I'm sorry,
first time we've met.

12:15.568 --> 12:17.445
And Richard you're not a
customer, what do you do?

12:17.445 --> 12:19.541
- I work with Sandy on
ideas for marketing.

12:19.541 --> 12:23.055
- What was the last big idea
you put into the Four Seasons?

12:23.055 --> 12:25.120
- Last big idea we had was purchasing

12:25.120 --> 12:27.059
lift tickets at a discounted rate.

12:27.059 --> 12:28.844
- Right, I would have
fired you five months ago.

12:28.844 --> 12:31.835
Coming into the Summer
what's the next big plan?

12:31.835 --> 12:35.349
- I can present plenty of ideas
but he has to accept them.

12:35.349 --> 12:37.674
I'm frustrated, I feel that the ideas

12:37.674 --> 12:39.154
that I bring to him are helpful.

12:39.154 --> 12:43.294
They would work, but Sandy
he's just not listening.

12:43.294 --> 12:45.015
- And here is your salmon.

12:45.015 --> 12:46.453
- Excellent, thank you, my darling.

12:46.453 --> 12:47.322
- Enjoy.

12:47.322 --> 12:48.191
- Thank you.

12:48.191 --> 12:49.418
- [Richard] Thank you.

12:49.418 --> 12:52.400
- Good God I hope it's
at least halfway good.

12:53.377 --> 12:57.235
- And that is a apple risotto,
wow, what a pile of shit.

13:00.040 --> 13:02.146
That sums it up on that plate there.

13:02.146 --> 13:07.287
He's as good a chef as he is
an innkeeper, fucking useless.

13:07.287 --> 13:08.976
I can't believe I've not seen Sandy

13:08.976 --> 13:10.415
once through my whole meal.

13:10.415 --> 13:11.645
What sort of innkeeper ignores

13:11.645 --> 13:13.689
his guest and hides in the kitchen?

13:13.689 --> 13:16.046
Well if he won't come to me...

13:16.046 --> 13:18.045
- [Sandy] Just give me that knife now.

13:18.045 --> 13:19.247
- [Gordon] Hi guys.

13:19.247 --> 13:21.071
- [Steve] Hi, I'm Steve Dickson.

13:21.071 --> 13:22.312
- Steve, good to see you bud.

13:22.312 --> 13:23.181
- Bill.

13:23.181 --> 13:24.992
- Bill good to see you too bud.

13:24.992 --> 13:27.620
I'm trying to get a grasp
on what I've just eaten.

13:27.620 --> 13:28.589
I know you're the owner.

13:28.589 --> 13:29.458
- Yes.

13:29.458 --> 13:30.692
- But you're the head chef as well?

13:30.692 --> 13:33.076
- We're working together now in tandem.

13:33.076 --> 13:35.120
- So you're both head chefs.

13:39.308 --> 13:41.186
- I'm not exactly sure where I fit in.

13:41.186 --> 13:43.969
It's not my menu, I'm
not doing any ordering.

13:43.969 --> 13:45.460
I feel with Sandy right now a little

13:45.460 --> 13:49.204
thrown under the bus, I feel
a little betrayed right now.

13:49.204 --> 13:51.790
The risotto was sweet, what
is in there, apple juice?

13:51.790 --> 13:53.635
- [Steve] Apple concentrate, chef.

13:53.635 --> 13:55.825
- [Gordon] Apple concentrate in a risotto?

13:57.243 --> 13:58.171
- Yes sir.

13:58.171 --> 13:59.203
- Come on.

13:59.203 --> 14:00.677
- It's not my menu, chef.

14:01.852 --> 14:04.420
- So this is all your doing then?

14:06.085 --> 14:06.954
- Yeah.

14:07.993 --> 14:09.531
- Oh my God.

14:09.531 --> 14:10.965
Can I just have five minutes on my own

14:10.965 --> 14:11.987
with the owner, would you mind?

14:11.987 --> 14:12.977
- [Steve] Yes chef.

14:21.844 --> 14:23.269
- I don't know how he
expects something magical

14:23.269 --> 14:25.657
when it's coming out of a fucking can.

14:25.657 --> 14:28.378
23 fucking years I wait to give him

14:28.378 --> 14:30.631
fucking apple juice concentrate.

14:30.631 --> 14:32.369
I just feel absolutely destroyed.

14:32.369 --> 14:34.363
My food is so much better than

14:34.363 --> 14:36.418
what I just fucking gave Gordon.

14:36.418 --> 14:37.881
Oh fuck.

14:40.944 --> 14:42.392
And you know, how am I going to go home

14:42.392 --> 14:44.071
and face my kids when
they're all proud of me

14:44.071 --> 14:46.683
and I'm like he fucking dogged our food,

14:46.683 --> 14:49.747
you know, that's not why I became a chef.

14:53.216 --> 14:56.886
- If you're in the kitchen
cooking who's running the inn?

14:56.886 --> 14:58.367
- Honestly I'm here and I'm busting

14:58.367 --> 14:59.879
my butt trying to get it
to where it should be.

14:59.879 --> 15:03.528
- There's no one running
this inn, that's the problem.

15:03.528 --> 15:05.697
Apart from being soulless it's rudderless.

15:05.697 --> 15:08.825
It's just a free for
all, you've checked out.

15:08.825 --> 15:09.694
- No I haven't.

15:09.694 --> 15:10.820
- Why would anyone come and stay here?

15:10.820 --> 15:13.121
- Because it's a nice
place in the country.

15:13.121 --> 15:14.393
- It's like a house of madness.

15:14.393 --> 15:15.477
- Yeah but it's...

15:15.477 --> 15:18.262
- It starts with you
Sandy, everyone is saying

15:18.262 --> 15:20.691
the management, the
management, the management,

15:20.691 --> 15:24.302
everybody is blaming the
management, the management is you.

15:28.773 --> 15:29.642
What a joke.

15:29.642 --> 15:31.903
- I'm ready to burn the building down.

15:35.789 --> 15:38.573
- The one thing Vermont's fake
Four Seasons has going for it

15:38.573 --> 15:40.690
is its beautiful riverside location.

15:40.690 --> 15:42.661
Lovely, what's that building over there?

15:42.661 --> 15:43.766
A guesthouse?

15:43.766 --> 15:45.257
- [Sandy] It's a dog kennel.

15:45.257 --> 15:46.488
- Is it used?

15:46.488 --> 15:48.409
- No the kennel doesn't do anything.

15:49.543 --> 15:51.257
Radiant heat floor, renewable

15:51.257 --> 15:53.641
energy with pellets in the furnace.

15:53.641 --> 15:56.279
- [Gordon] They're cramped and
bare, it looks like a prison.

15:56.279 --> 15:57.436
And what's through here?

15:57.436 --> 16:00.231
- This is a giant indoor
play area for the dogs.

16:00.231 --> 16:01.638
- [Gordon] A play area?

16:01.638 --> 16:05.319
I wouldn't put my dog in a
place like this, what a waste.

16:05.319 --> 16:06.925
But it all looks unused.

16:06.925 --> 16:07.793
- [Sandy] They are.

16:07.793 --> 16:08.662
- [Gordon] Jeez.

16:08.662 --> 16:09.973
- [Sandy] My marketing executive sucks.

16:09.973 --> 16:11.641
- [Gordon] I think you're right.

16:13.025 --> 16:13.893
Crazy.

16:16.466 --> 16:17.988
Word has got out that I'm in town

16:17.988 --> 16:19.865
so the Four Seasons dining room is full

16:19.865 --> 16:21.672
of customers for the first time in months.

16:21.672 --> 16:24.088
- Here we are, dinner is served.

16:24.088 --> 16:26.079
- [Gordon] I feel sorry for all of them.

16:26.079 --> 16:29.280
- Sandy, honestly I wouldn't
even feed that to a dog.

16:29.280 --> 16:30.897
- Are you familiar with the area?

16:30.897 --> 16:31.971
- [Guest] We live in town.

16:31.971 --> 16:32.839
- Oh nice.

16:32.839 --> 16:34.567
- [Gordon] With everyone
looking after the restaurant...

16:34.567 --> 16:37.372
- Water, food get it outta
here, I'm tired of waiting.

16:37.372 --> 16:39.718
- [Gordon] And Sandy burying
himself in the kitchen.

16:39.718 --> 16:41.324
There is no-one to look after the inn.

16:41.324 --> 16:42.512
- [Jean] You guys checking in?

16:42.512 --> 16:43.482
- [Guest] We are.

16:43.482 --> 16:44.587
- [Gordon] So the servers are forced

16:44.587 --> 16:47.622
to check in guests in the
middle of dinner service.

16:47.622 --> 16:49.290
- The room rate's $275.

16:49.290 --> 16:50.353
- Okay.

16:50.353 --> 16:51.845
- Get that to you right now.

16:51.845 --> 16:52.826
- [Guest] Thank you very much.

16:52.826 --> 16:53.694
- [Jean] No problem.

16:53.694 --> 16:54.563
- Is that normal that?

16:54.563 --> 16:55.595
Friday night walk in like that

16:55.595 --> 16:58.382
and you just charged them $275.

16:58.382 --> 17:00.218
Can you just go and ask the owner?

17:00.218 --> 17:01.167
- [Jean] Excuse me Sandy?

17:01.167 --> 17:02.035
- [Sandy] Yes?

17:02.035 --> 17:03.325
- [Jean] How much is Friday walk-in?

17:03.325 --> 17:04.484
- $209.

17:04.484 --> 17:06.568
- Okay, because that's
what he told me $275, so...

17:06.568 --> 17:07.694
- How come nobody knows?

17:07.694 --> 17:09.982
We need a level of
consistency across the board.

17:09.982 --> 17:10.849
- I know, from now on.

17:10.849 --> 17:13.074
- $300 with tax is a joke.

17:13.074 --> 17:14.962
- I don't think I've been properly trained

17:14.962 --> 17:17.506
at the desk and I feel
like I'm training myself.

17:17.506 --> 17:20.008
- Go and apologise to them
and say its $209 now, right.

17:20.008 --> 17:22.271
The inn is the busiest it's been in months

17:22.271 --> 17:25.959
but Sandy is still hiding
in the kitchen playing chef.

17:25.959 --> 17:27.432
Oh for God's sake.

17:27.432 --> 17:29.747
Upstairs, guests are experiencing

17:29.747 --> 17:31.926
the unique charm of the Four Seasons Inn.

17:31.926 --> 17:32.980
- We don't have any towels and

17:32.980 --> 17:35.440
we found some garbage under the bed.

17:35.440 --> 17:37.223
There is that and a light bulb.

17:37.223 --> 17:38.350
- [Guest] I'd have been really upset

17:38.350 --> 17:39.404
if my dog had eaten a light bulb.

17:39.404 --> 17:40.863
- [Erin] Okay, I'm so sorry.

17:41.801 --> 17:44.314
- Can't get over the
barking in the background.

17:44.314 --> 17:46.433
The barking is unnerving.

17:46.433 --> 17:48.401
- [Gordon] I can't believe
an owner turns such

17:48.401 --> 17:50.779
a blind eye to the problems in his inn.

17:50.779 --> 17:52.781
I've got to stop him
hiding behind the stove.

17:52.781 --> 17:54.386
Will you take two minutes
out and go have a look at

17:54.386 --> 17:55.255
the dining room and check on things?

17:55.255 --> 17:57.056
Do you have any idea
what's going on out there?

17:57.056 --> 17:59.975
- Right now I'm needed right back here.

17:59.975 --> 18:01.679
- Can you handle this
line Steve for 30 seconds?

18:01.679 --> 18:03.640
- Absolutely chef, absolutely chef.

18:03.640 --> 18:04.767
- While the owner has a look at his

18:04.767 --> 18:06.256
business before it sinks any further.

18:07.848 --> 18:08.716
Is he for real?

18:08.716 --> 18:10.496
- He's an owner not someone who should

18:10.496 --> 18:13.499
be doing what I should
be doing, bottom line.

18:13.499 --> 18:15.460
- I've just never seen
this shit going on before.

18:15.460 --> 18:17.531
- This is unorganised fucking
chaos is what this is.

18:17.531 --> 18:19.589
- I'm glad somebody has got

18:19.589 --> 18:21.413
their fingers on the fucking pulse.

18:22.529 --> 18:23.999
- How was everything?

18:26.356 --> 18:27.555
- [Guest] I didn't eat.

18:28.483 --> 18:31.573
My risotto wasn't creamy risotto.

18:32.456 --> 18:34.481
And the vegetables were very, very hard

18:34.481 --> 18:35.824
like they had just come out of the garden.

18:35.824 --> 18:37.417
- [Sandy] How is everything so far?

18:37.417 --> 18:39.869
(laughing)

18:39.869 --> 18:41.444
- They pulled out the wrong order.

18:41.444 --> 18:43.440
They bought the entrÃ©e first and...

18:43.440 --> 18:45.383
- [Guest] And that was
after a 40 minute wait.

18:45.383 --> 18:46.564
- Being told in the restaurant nothing

18:46.564 --> 18:47.972
is at the level you think it was

18:47.972 --> 18:50.776
its like getting kicked in the nuts.

18:50.776 --> 18:53.852
I feel like I just wanted to
run into the kitchen and hide.

18:56.480 --> 18:58.920
- Sandy avoiding his guests
is a mad way to run an inn

18:58.920 --> 19:01.798
but it's the lack of pay
that's crippling his business.

19:01.798 --> 19:03.695
I have to confront it head on.

19:03.695 --> 19:04.564
- [Gordon] Let's have five minutes

19:04.564 --> 19:06.135
together in the lounge please everybody.

19:06.135 --> 19:09.840
- Holy Jesus what is about to go down now?

19:12.298 --> 19:14.376
- Who in this room actually gets paid?

19:20.254 --> 19:22.422
That's why there is no
standards because nobody

19:22.422 --> 19:26.252
is getting paid so there's
no responsibilities.

19:30.086 --> 19:32.714
If you pay peanuts you get monkeys,

19:32.714 --> 19:34.969
if you pay nothing you get fuck all.

19:36.509 --> 19:40.058
Zero, it's not a business
it's a fucking joke.

19:40.951 --> 19:42.317
Talk to me Sandy.

19:42.317 --> 19:44.849
- Honestly Gordon we started off with all

19:44.849 --> 19:48.135
the good intentions and we've
hit every bump in the road.

19:48.135 --> 19:51.222
When we started out we
started out wonderfully.

19:51.222 --> 19:55.737
- Stop it, it's an
embarrassment, stop the lies.

19:55.737 --> 19:56.654
- There is no lies.

19:56.654 --> 19:59.543
- You were not booming
when you first opened.

19:59.543 --> 20:00.648
- Air it out, go ahead.

20:00.648 --> 20:02.556
- Nobody believes it Sandy.

20:02.556 --> 20:03.425
- Where's your marketing?

20:03.425 --> 20:04.829
- There's nothing to market.

20:04.829 --> 20:06.529
- So what have you done?

20:06.529 --> 20:09.740
- For God's sake man, please...

20:18.145 --> 20:20.407
I'm exhausted, it's been nerve wracking

20:20.407 --> 20:25.037
to watch this go off
in the wrong direction.

20:25.037 --> 20:29.083
- You can't run a business
with no infrastructure

20:29.083 --> 20:31.293
and you can't have a business that has

20:31.293 --> 20:35.384
got nobody heading it, enough for one day.

20:36.671 --> 20:39.353
I'm going to pick this
up in the morning, night.

20:39.353 --> 20:40.344
- [Steve] Good night chef.

20:40.344 --> 20:41.974
- [Gordon] I wish I could say good night.

20:44.577 --> 20:46.238
- Ah truth hurts.

20:51.146 --> 20:53.607
I guess I can be one big asshole, can't I?

21:02.873 --> 21:08.086
- Bed linen is horrible and
a disgusting smelly pillow.

21:08.946 --> 21:11.422
So far my stay at
Vermont's fake Four Seasons

21:11.422 --> 21:13.140
has been a huge disappointment.

21:14.050 --> 21:15.181
Oh shit.

21:15.181 --> 21:17.193
The owner doesn't know
his ass from his elbow.

21:17.193 --> 21:18.549
- Oh that's nice.

21:18.549 --> 21:21.020
- [Gordon] The staff don't get paid.

21:21.020 --> 21:22.386
The guests are miserable.

21:22.386 --> 21:24.461
- There's a stain here, next to the bed.

21:24.461 --> 21:26.400
- [Gordon] Only Layla
the dog is happy here.

21:26.400 --> 21:27.738
I'm hoping a quick dip
in the swimming pool

21:27.738 --> 21:30.686
will get my day off to a better start.

21:30.686 --> 21:33.470
Does that look like a present from Layla?

21:33.470 --> 21:36.327
A floating turd, oh my God.

21:36.327 --> 21:39.637
Layla did you shit in the pool?

21:39.637 --> 21:41.395
There is no way I'm going in there.

21:41.395 --> 21:43.105
How about the hot tub?

21:43.105 --> 21:46.679
Slightly warm and Layla

21:46.679 --> 21:49.103
hasn't taken a shit in it, great news.

21:50.133 --> 21:51.957
Ah it's a lot warmer.

21:55.347 --> 21:56.216
Ah, man.

21:57.958 --> 21:59.277
The actual hot tub is quite nice.

21:59.277 --> 22:01.804
What a gorgeous view of the river.

22:06.274 --> 22:07.827
This place has a lot of potential

22:07.827 --> 22:09.704
but only if I can get Sandy to stop hiding

22:09.704 --> 22:11.831
from his guests and the problems here.

22:11.831 --> 22:14.084
I'm going to confront him
with his worst nightmare.

22:14.084 --> 22:17.274
To wake him up to his
responsibilities as an innkeeper.

22:17.274 --> 22:18.143
- Good morning Gordon.

22:18.143 --> 22:19.011
- Hey guys.

22:19.011 --> 22:20.642
- How you doing chef?

22:20.642 --> 22:23.134
- Come upstairs, something
I want to show you.

22:23.134 --> 22:25.355
- I'm thinking okay he's going
to show me something wrong.

22:25.355 --> 22:27.701
Maybe the hole in the
wall board by the door.

22:33.965 --> 22:34.834
- [Gordon] Good morning.

22:34.834 --> 22:35.866
- [Crowd] Good morning.

22:35.866 --> 22:38.723
- No it's a roomful of people,

22:38.723 --> 22:40.373
I thought I was gonna pass out.

22:42.289 --> 22:44.917
- I'm here to help this place,

22:44.917 --> 22:47.607
I really need your honest feedback.

22:47.607 --> 22:49.804
Sir would you mind if we start with you?

22:49.804 --> 22:52.069
- There was a sign that
I liked when we came in

22:52.069 --> 22:53.613
about all dogs have to be on a leash

22:53.613 --> 22:55.928
and we had our dog and we come in

22:55.928 --> 22:57.523
and there was immediately another

22:57.523 --> 22:59.389
dog coming at us not on a leash.

22:59.389 --> 23:01.193
Our dog's friendly but it always

23:01.193 --> 23:02.820
takes a few minutes with new animals.

23:02.820 --> 23:03.688
- Sure.

23:03.688 --> 23:05.395
- I had read that it was dog friendly.

23:06.331 --> 23:07.387
I thought it was really
interesting that there

23:07.387 --> 23:09.378
is a dog laying in the dining room

23:09.378 --> 23:12.069
and as much as we like dogs I don't

23:12.069 --> 23:15.402
want a dog in where I'm eating.

23:15.402 --> 23:17.540
- And I agree, I think that's disgusting.

23:19.003 --> 23:22.923
There is one last person I'd
like to introduce you to.

23:22.923 --> 23:27.386
Amy Lumis, this lady
is the General Manager

23:27.386 --> 23:30.525
of one of the Hilton Brand
hotels and if there is one thing

23:30.525 --> 23:33.674
this lady knows it's how to run a hotel.

23:33.674 --> 23:35.186
First impressions walking in?

23:36.134 --> 23:41.348
- At dinner there was dog
hair on the tablecloth,

23:41.431 --> 23:43.934
dog hair on the plate that we were given.

23:43.934 --> 23:45.342
I asked to speak with the manager.

23:45.342 --> 23:47.169
I was told there is no manager.

23:48.094 --> 23:51.024
We have an owner, I said I'd
like to speak with them then.

23:51.024 --> 23:52.925
I was told you were too busy.

23:54.934 --> 23:57.364
- I've never had the
complaints that I had today.

23:57.364 --> 23:59.272
It's humiliating, it's embarrassing.

23:59.272 --> 24:01.670
It's like being flogged
in the centre of town.

24:03.672 --> 24:05.945
- There's something I
need to show you all.

24:05.945 --> 24:07.833
I need you all to put a
pair of these on please.

24:07.833 --> 24:08.875
- [Crowd] Oh no, no.

24:10.227 --> 24:11.095
- You okay?

24:11.095 --> 24:12.337
You've gone a funny colour.

24:12.337 --> 24:15.278
- I'm hot and absorbing everything.

24:15.278 --> 24:16.146
- Yeah?

24:16.146 --> 24:17.015
- Yes.

24:20.408 --> 24:23.331
- Okay, lights off.

24:24.933 --> 24:27.662
Now this black light
shows up bodily fluids.

24:27.662 --> 24:29.313
- [Guest] What? Oh.

24:31.607 --> 24:35.697
- [Crowd] Oh right there, oh,
oh, oh, oh yeah a big one.

24:36.653 --> 24:37.842
- [Gordon] Sandy can you see that?

24:37.842 --> 24:39.500
- Yes.

24:39.500 --> 24:41.432
- [Gordon] Yeah I slept on that pillow.

24:42.951 --> 24:47.800
Charging guests to sleep on
such filth is outrageous.

24:47.800 --> 24:50.629
The quilt, see the splashes?

24:50.629 --> 24:51.533
- [Guest] Yeah.

24:51.533 --> 24:52.701
- [Gordon] Do you know what that is?

24:52.701 --> 24:54.463
- [Crowd] I don't want to know.

24:54.463 --> 24:58.029
- It begins with S, yeah, I'm sorry.

24:58.029 --> 25:00.823
Yeah, disgusting, but I want to show

25:00.823 --> 25:01.939
you something over by your feet.

25:01.939 --> 25:03.764
Sandy come over here.

25:03.764 --> 25:05.993
- [Guest] Oh no, no, no, no.

25:05.993 --> 25:07.716
- [Gordon] Can you see that?

25:07.716 --> 25:08.584
- [Sandy] Oh yeah.

25:08.584 --> 25:09.586
- [Gordon] The carpet, Sandy?

25:09.586 --> 25:10.781
- Yes.

25:10.781 --> 25:12.137
- [Gordon] I mean honestly?

25:12.137 --> 25:13.857
Madam, your feet are right on it.

25:15.108 --> 25:16.842
Look, you see that?

25:18.080 --> 25:21.344
- Stains on the carpet I have no idea.

25:21.344 --> 25:23.189
That could be a dog,
that could be a human.

25:23.189 --> 25:25.838
If it's a human, good Christmas.

25:25.838 --> 25:27.537
- [Gordon] Just when
you thought it was safe

25:27.537 --> 25:30.009
to walk in bare feet, trust me, that has

25:30.009 --> 25:33.783
never, ever been cleaned,
absolutely disgusting.

25:33.783 --> 25:34.972
- [Crowd] Oh yeah, yes, yes, yes.

25:34.972 --> 25:37.613
- Please take your glasses
off and the lights on.

25:39.122 --> 25:41.041
I have a very important question.

25:41.041 --> 25:43.452
I mean, who would return here?

25:47.818 --> 25:51.217
- Chef, we have another day to stay here,

25:51.217 --> 25:55.305
today and tomorrow, and after seeing

25:55.305 --> 25:59.934
the light I don't wanna stay here tonight.

25:59.934 --> 26:01.280
I don't want to put my head on

26:01.280 --> 26:03.365
that pillow or any of the other pillows.

26:06.212 --> 26:09.110
- No-one would return
and the existing guests

26:09.110 --> 26:11.616
that we have want to check out.

26:13.834 --> 26:15.502
Thank you madam, please, thank you.

26:15.502 --> 26:17.212
- You're looking at a
room full of customers

26:17.212 --> 26:18.630
who are looking at you saying

26:18.630 --> 26:20.882
I can't believe you put me in there.

26:20.882 --> 26:24.772
And that's maddening
and it's embarrassing.

26:24.772 --> 26:27.726
- I need some fresh air, I feel sick.

26:31.956 --> 26:35.160
- It sucks to know where I am
right now, it's horrifying.

26:37.743 --> 26:39.912
It does hurt me inside,
the tears just keep coming

26:39.912 --> 26:42.689
out of my face and it's not what I wanted.

26:45.762 --> 26:46.630
I'm mortified.

26:50.725 --> 26:51.593
- [Gordon] It's been a tough

26:51.593 --> 26:52.987
few days at the Four Seasons Inn.

26:53.884 --> 26:54.753
Do we have another room?

26:54.753 --> 26:56.908
Because I'm not going
to be staying in here.

26:56.908 --> 26:59.160
The food is fucking hideous.

26:59.160 --> 27:01.197
This black light shows bodily fluids.

27:02.288 --> 27:03.373
Absolutely disgusting.

27:03.373 --> 27:04.843
- I don't want to stay here tonight.

27:04.843 --> 27:07.106
I don't want to put my
head on that pillow.

27:07.106 --> 27:08.378
- [Gordon] The truth
has been hard for Sandy

27:08.378 --> 27:10.734
to hear but he's finally
realised the damage

27:10.734 --> 27:12.841
that hiding from his customers has caused.

27:12.841 --> 27:14.592
Now that I've opened his eyes I've got

27:14.592 --> 27:16.501
to figure out a way to
make his business work.

27:16.501 --> 27:17.369
Hello Layla.

27:17.369 --> 27:20.466
So that Sandy has no excuses
not to pay his staff.

27:21.662 --> 27:23.933
You have so much weight on your shoulders

27:23.933 --> 27:25.770
and you're being totally oblivious

27:25.770 --> 27:28.054
to what your customers need.

27:28.054 --> 27:31.081
You cannot run an inn from behind a stove.

27:32.642 --> 27:34.081
You're not the head chef.

27:34.081 --> 27:38.541
You're the innkeeper and
that can be an amazing job.

27:38.541 --> 27:40.650
That can be an amazing prospect.

27:40.650 --> 27:42.005
That can be an exciting role.

27:42.005 --> 27:44.636
- Trust me, I am ready, I
spent last night crying.

27:45.926 --> 27:49.586
That's no lie, this was a
dream since I was a little kid.

27:49.586 --> 27:52.189
This is what I want, I love what I do.

27:52.189 --> 27:53.892
But I would love to get back to

27:53.892 --> 27:56.197
where I should be as an innkeeper.

27:56.197 --> 28:01.410
- You have a potential
goldmine here, embrace it.

28:02.521 --> 28:03.389
Okay?

28:03.389 --> 28:04.258
- Yes sir.

28:04.258 --> 28:09.471
- I know it's hard, it's normal
to get upset but just get...

28:09.585 --> 28:11.827
- Embarrassed, mortified, yes

28:11.827 --> 28:12.727
- Your head out...

28:12.727 --> 28:14.326
- Of my ass.

28:14.326 --> 28:17.450
- And absolutely start building the dream.

28:19.699 --> 28:20.804
We're gonna make this work.

28:20.804 --> 28:21.701
- Thank you sir.

28:21.701 --> 28:23.078
- Okay?

28:23.078 --> 28:25.194
With Sandy committed to change

28:25.194 --> 28:27.530
it's time to get the crew involved.

28:27.530 --> 28:28.562
Let's go and have a couple

28:28.562 --> 28:30.335
of minutes outside on the terrace.

28:31.871 --> 28:35.809
I have some very important breaking news.

28:35.809 --> 28:41.023
This man from this day
on is not the head chef.

28:45.152 --> 28:49.197
This man is going to become the innkeeper.

28:49.197 --> 28:51.189
No longer will he be burying his

28:51.189 --> 28:55.245
head inside the kitchen ignoring issues.

28:55.245 --> 29:00.459
He'll be running his inn, you are the chef

29:00.855 --> 29:04.192
and this is your general manager.

29:07.333 --> 29:10.834
And as a reminder to
make sure we step forward

29:10.834 --> 29:14.087
and not backwards he is not going

29:14.087 --> 29:16.496
to be needing these fucking things.

29:16.496 --> 29:18.824
Say goodbye to Sandy's chef coats.

29:22.851 --> 29:24.329
- [Bill] Gordon, Gordon.

29:26.641 --> 29:28.601
- Burn that thing, get rid of that thing.

29:28.601 --> 29:31.047
He has no business wearing it.

29:31.047 --> 29:33.393
(laughter)

29:34.858 --> 29:37.670
- Thank you.

29:37.670 --> 29:40.895
- You may be a great guy but

29:40.895 --> 29:43.627
you are not a fucking great chef.

29:43.627 --> 29:46.400
Let's get that right,
there is a big difference.

29:46.400 --> 29:47.558
- There is.

29:47.558 --> 29:50.999
Gordon coming here has opened
my eyes to my shortcomings.

29:50.999 --> 29:53.869
I love what I do and I
need to start doing it.

29:54.837 --> 29:55.706
- [Gordon] Got it?

29:55.706 --> 29:56.574
- Yes sir.

29:56.574 --> 29:59.205
- [Gordon] There are some very
big changes coming tomorrow.

29:59.205 --> 30:01.064
Embrace them, get ready for it.

30:04.512 --> 30:05.868
This inn has been neglected for

30:05.868 --> 30:07.971
so long but now I'm finally giving

30:07.971 --> 30:11.332
it the makeover it truly deserves.

30:11.332 --> 30:12.468
- [Sandy] Come on girl.

30:12.468 --> 30:13.396
- Good morning.

30:13.396 --> 30:14.606
- Good morning Gordon.

30:14.606 --> 30:18.276
- Wow, Sandy you look incredible.

30:18.276 --> 30:19.680
- Thank you sir, I feel incredible.

30:19.680 --> 30:21.290
- Man, oh man, how you doing?

30:21.290 --> 30:23.528
- I feel liberated to be honest with you.

30:24.521 --> 30:25.940
- Great, huh?

30:25.940 --> 30:28.310
- With the fresh shave, new
hair cut, I feel amazing.

30:28.310 --> 30:29.715
I feel like a million dollars, I

30:29.715 --> 30:31.571
feel like what I spent on my inn.

30:31.571 --> 30:34.487
- What do you you guys
think of your new innkeeper?

30:34.487 --> 30:36.833
(applause)

30:38.098 --> 30:41.427
- You look like a proper
innkeeper and an owner.

30:43.249 --> 30:45.414
Right, when I first arrived I drove into

30:45.414 --> 30:50.627
the Four Seasons Inn but this
establishment is a one off.

30:50.777 --> 30:52.149
It's not part of a chain, right?

30:52.149 --> 30:53.017
- No sir.

30:53.017 --> 30:54.781
- So you deserve your own name,

30:54.781 --> 30:57.263
your own identity and something
that you can be proud of.

30:57.263 --> 30:59.679
Everybody is going to know you now as..

31:05.037 --> 31:05.906
Welcome.

31:08.469 --> 31:11.256
Layla's Riverside Lodge.

31:11.256 --> 31:14.357
Great rooms, fresh food
and luxury kennels.

31:14.357 --> 31:18.555
- That is amazing, Layla's
Riverside Lodge is amazing.

31:18.555 --> 31:20.682
The name is awesome,
the sign is beautiful.

31:20.682 --> 31:23.320
It just describes me.

31:23.320 --> 31:24.189
- What do you think?

31:24.189 --> 31:25.604
- I think it's absolutely perfect

31:25.604 --> 31:28.664
and represents something
so meaningful to Sandy.

31:28.664 --> 31:30.116
- You're absolutely right.

31:30.116 --> 31:30.984
You okay?

31:30.984 --> 31:31.853
- Yeah.

31:31.853 --> 31:32.721
- [Gordon] You sure?

31:32.721 --> 31:33.590
- I'm positive.

31:33.590 --> 31:34.795
- Layla, what do you think?

31:34.795 --> 31:37.748
(laughter)

31:37.748 --> 31:38.617
Shall we go inside?

31:38.617 --> 31:40.181
- [Sandy] I'd love to.

31:40.181 --> 31:44.845
- This is the new reception
area, have a look at this.

31:46.919 --> 31:48.119
- Holy shit.

31:53.382 --> 31:57.751
- [Gordon] So, let's welcome our guests in

31:57.751 --> 32:02.964
to a proper reception area,
this is inviting, this is warm.

32:03.194 --> 32:04.101
- [Sandy] I love it.

32:04.101 --> 32:04.969
- [Gordon] Isn't it nice?

32:04.969 --> 32:05.838
- [Sandy] Breathtaking.

32:05.838 --> 32:06.706
- [Gordon] Isn't it lovely?

32:06.706 --> 32:07.575
- [Sandy] Gorgeous.

32:07.575 --> 32:09.377
- If you have an inviting
lounge then you need the menu

32:09.377 --> 32:12.286
to go with it, gents come through please.

32:12.286 --> 32:13.954
I've created a farm-to-table menu

32:13.954 --> 32:15.654
of fresh food that will give people

32:15.654 --> 32:17.703
a warm and friendly Vermont welcome.

32:17.703 --> 32:20.065
I've revamped the entire menu, let me tell

32:20.065 --> 32:21.785
you about some of my favourites.

32:21.785 --> 32:25.163
Homemade country pate, I
mean look where we are.

32:25.163 --> 32:27.019
Look at the farms surrounding the inn.

32:27.019 --> 32:29.009
How can you not have a
stunning country pate?

32:29.009 --> 32:32.598
Wonderful poutine done with
a braised pork shoulder.

32:32.598 --> 32:35.465
Stunning chicken pot pie, easy
to execute for the kitchen.

32:35.465 --> 32:38.854
Baked, job done and then our
stunning Vermont cheesecake.

32:38.854 --> 32:39.897
- [Steve] Oh my God.

32:40.814 --> 32:41.899
- How are you feeling?

32:41.899 --> 32:43.786
- Very hopeful for the future now.

32:43.786 --> 32:47.238
- Are you happier now that
Sandy is out of the kitchen?

32:47.238 --> 32:52.451
- I am absolutely ecstatic that
Sandy is out of the kitchen.

32:52.628 --> 32:55.412
The menu is absolutely perfect.

32:55.412 --> 32:57.188
- [Sandy] All right now don't be shy.

32:58.123 --> 32:58.992
- Oh my God.

33:00.292 --> 33:02.962
- Wow, that pasta is a
world of difference, man.

33:02.962 --> 33:05.912
- Before when people asked
me where I worked I used

33:05.912 --> 33:09.155
to hang my head and say the Four Seasons.

33:09.155 --> 33:12.356
Not gonna do that no
more, I can look at them

33:12.356 --> 33:14.598
right in the eye and
say I work at Layla's.

33:18.236 --> 33:20.177
It's gonna be good.

33:20.177 --> 33:21.045
- [Gordon] I'm delighted they like

33:21.045 --> 33:23.399
the new name and new menu, I can't wait

33:23.399 --> 33:25.404
to see what they think of the bedrooms.

33:27.695 --> 33:29.710
- Oh my God.

33:34.796 --> 33:37.173
- [Gordon] Gone is that hideous wallpaper,

33:37.173 --> 33:39.825
replaced with this
stunning wooden feature.

33:41.417 --> 33:44.534
- I love the deer, I love that.

33:44.534 --> 33:47.204
- We have steamed the carpet

33:47.204 --> 33:49.227
so gone are those hideous stains.

33:49.227 --> 33:52.017
We have a luxury bed for the dog

33:52.017 --> 33:54.920
and what I was more depressed with

33:54.920 --> 33:57.839
than anything was the linen was hideous.

33:57.839 --> 34:02.377
We have replaced the bedding in every

34:02.377 --> 34:07.591
room of your inn with
$100,000 of organic linens.

34:12.125 --> 34:13.871
You happy, you happy?

34:13.871 --> 34:17.087
- Ecstatic, it's really overwhelming.

34:19.455 --> 34:20.696
- Do you wanna see another room?

34:20.696 --> 34:21.563
- Love to.

34:21.563 --> 34:22.978
- This one you're going to love.

34:24.001 --> 34:27.362
Welcome, room three, look at this.

34:27.362 --> 34:28.453
- Wow.

34:28.453 --> 34:29.322
- [Gordon] Gone are those flimsy

34:29.322 --> 34:32.405
bunk beds, give your guests some space.

34:32.405 --> 34:34.803
- It's something I would
want to check into.

34:34.803 --> 34:36.972
- I love the new rooms, they're amazing.

34:36.972 --> 34:38.922
I actually can't wait to clean them.

34:38.922 --> 34:41.268
I'm really excited about how
everything came together.

34:41.268 --> 34:44.021
- There's one more exciting
thing I've got to show you.

34:44.021 --> 34:48.953
Something that I feel can
transform this business.

34:48.953 --> 34:49.880
You ready?

34:49.880 --> 34:50.766
- Yes sir.

34:50.766 --> 34:51.636
- Let's go.

34:58.525 --> 34:59.394
- [Gordon] I've just revealed the

34:59.394 --> 35:01.215
new improvements to Sandy's inn.

35:01.215 --> 35:03.269
However, there is still one more surprise

35:03.269 --> 35:06.981
I have for him that will
really put Layla's on the map.

35:06.981 --> 35:10.019
- Welcome to the thing that
makes your lodge unique.

35:11.805 --> 35:13.898
A new and improved dog kennel.

35:15.104 --> 35:17.036
- [Sandy] Amazing, I'm stunned.

35:20.756 --> 35:23.362
- [Gordon] We've doubled
the size of these kennels.

35:23.362 --> 35:25.364
We've made them feel luxurious.

35:25.364 --> 35:27.419
We have beautiful brand new bedding.

35:27.419 --> 35:31.162
When I first arrived these
kennels felt like a prison.

35:31.162 --> 35:34.154
Now it feels like a reward or a treat.

35:34.154 --> 35:36.563
Any dog lover would want
their dogs to stay, even me.

35:36.563 --> 35:38.586
I'd bring my old dogs here.

35:38.586 --> 35:39.455
- I hope you do.

35:39.455 --> 35:40.852
- Do you want to meet Rumpole?

35:43.654 --> 35:47.713
Hello mate, hello bud, there he is.

35:50.046 --> 35:52.860
Come here, Rumpole meet Layla, come on.

35:52.860 --> 35:55.488
- [Sandy] Hello, oh yes.

35:55.488 --> 35:56.357
- [Gordon] Look at you.

35:56.357 --> 35:57.225
Who's that?

35:57.225 --> 35:58.094
Who's that?

35:58.094 --> 35:59.328
Rumpole.

35:59.328 --> 36:01.326
- Oh man, how adorable.

36:03.851 --> 36:05.210
- How gorgeous.

36:06.624 --> 36:09.082
Now this part for me is one of

36:09.082 --> 36:13.149
the most exciting parts, come
this way, please come in.

36:20.430 --> 36:22.818
- I've never seen the
kennel with that many dogs

36:22.818 --> 36:27.450
and that many people and that many smiles.

36:29.229 --> 36:30.098
- [Gordon] Are you okay?

36:30.098 --> 36:30.967
- Yes.

36:30.967 --> 36:31.835
- Are you sure?

36:31.835 --> 36:32.704
- Yes.

36:32.704 --> 36:33.572
- The dogs are here because we've

36:33.572 --> 36:35.612
organised a dog agility competition.

36:35.612 --> 36:36.922
- Oh, no kidding wow.

36:36.922 --> 36:38.761
- And all the owners are
going to be checking in

36:38.761 --> 36:42.097
and staying in the inn this evening.

36:42.097 --> 36:44.893
This kind of event can be done every month

36:44.893 --> 36:47.621
which will drive dog enthusiasts to come

36:47.621 --> 36:51.753
and stay in your stunning lodge.

36:51.753 --> 36:52.945
- Sounds amazing.

36:53.838 --> 36:57.512
- [Gordon] So we've livened
the place up, given it warmth.

36:58.677 --> 37:00.699
And Sandy this is Shannon Heggum,

37:00.699 --> 37:02.298
you may recognise this lady.

37:02.298 --> 37:03.166
- Oh yes I do.

37:03.166 --> 37:05.840
- She is a luxury boarding
kennel consultant.

37:05.840 --> 37:11.053
She has very kindly donated
to you $10,000 worth

37:12.132 --> 37:14.974
of consultancy that she is going

37:14.974 --> 37:19.217
to help implement and get
this business off the ground.

37:19.217 --> 37:20.740
- Thank you.

37:20.740 --> 37:24.351
- Now let's get back to the
inn, thank you my darling.

37:25.266 --> 37:28.029
With a delicious new menu
and a name of its own,

37:28.029 --> 37:29.937
Layla's Riverside Lodge is ready to open

37:29.937 --> 37:32.474
its doors and show off
its stunning new look.

37:33.722 --> 37:35.484
- Ladies, guys, this is the night

37:35.484 --> 37:37.841
that we come back from the dead.

37:37.841 --> 37:39.874
We've been afforded all the tools.

37:39.874 --> 37:42.168
A great front of house,
a great back of house.

37:42.168 --> 37:45.922
And we're going to make
this rock, kick some butt.

37:45.922 --> 37:48.052
If we blow this we're screwed.

37:49.905 --> 37:51.531
Good evening and welcome to Layla's.

37:51.531 --> 37:53.169
My name is Sandy, I'm your innkeeper.

37:53.169 --> 37:54.037
- [Guest] Hi.

37:54.037 --> 37:55.108
- [Sandy] Follow me I'll
take you to your room.

37:55.108 --> 37:55.977
- [Guest] Thank you.

37:55.977 --> 37:56.845
- Here we go.

37:58.652 --> 37:59.521
- Oh wow.

37:59.521 --> 38:00.389
- [Gordon] The renovated rooms are

38:00.389 --> 38:01.531
a big hit with the new guests.

38:01.531 --> 38:03.637
- Can't wait to get under the sheets.

38:03.637 --> 38:05.368
- Let me try this.

38:05.368 --> 38:06.282
- Oh yeah.

38:06.282 --> 38:08.353
- She can just kinda hang out and

38:08.353 --> 38:11.843
be herself right by the window,
she can look at the pool.

38:11.843 --> 38:12.712
- [Guest] She's got her own porch.

38:12.712 --> 38:15.232
- [Guest] Look at that
wow, this is awesome.

38:15.232 --> 38:16.494
- [Gordon] Dinner is under way.

38:16.494 --> 38:17.362
- [Sandy] It's to die for isn't it?

38:17.362 --> 38:19.476
- [Gordon] And at last
Sandy is spending time

38:19.476 --> 38:22.562
with his hotel guests and
letting his chefs do the cooking.

38:22.562 --> 38:23.431
- [Sandy] Good evening, how is everything?

38:23.431 --> 38:24.761
- [Guest] It was great.

38:24.761 --> 38:25.837
- Fantastic.

38:25.837 --> 38:28.548
Tonight is the best night we've had here.

38:28.548 --> 38:30.070
There wasn't one complaint, there wasn't

38:30.070 --> 38:32.093
one plate with food left on it.

38:32.093 --> 38:34.157
There is a difference between the

38:34.157 --> 38:35.805
last time that we were here.

38:35.805 --> 38:39.061
And this time is just
phenomenally different.

38:42.134 --> 38:43.445
- Well done steak in the oven.

38:43.445 --> 38:44.543
- Love the communication, yeah.

38:44.543 --> 38:47.181
- Tonight it actually is like
cooking in a real kitchen.

38:47.181 --> 38:49.704
No Sandy back there, everybody's trained.

38:49.704 --> 38:51.748
Everybody is on the same page.

38:51.748 --> 38:55.077
We got great food,
everything from scratch.

38:57.447 --> 38:58.599
- Any concerns, good?

38:58.599 --> 38:59.482
- [Steve] We're good.

38:59.482 --> 39:01.206
- That's what I wanna hear.

39:01.206 --> 39:02.457
- [Gordon] And while Sandy's human guests

39:02.457 --> 39:04.302
are loving the food his canine guests

39:04.302 --> 39:06.721
are finding lots to love as well.

39:06.721 --> 39:08.911
- So welcome to the new kennel.

39:08.911 --> 39:12.811
- Wow, it's bright, airy, smells nice.

39:12.811 --> 39:14.343
You've got friends, it's fantastic.

39:14.343 --> 39:17.211
You have to be thrilled, it's beautiful.

39:17.211 --> 39:19.456
- I'm on cloud nine, I
hope to ride this high

39:19.456 --> 39:23.794
for many years to come, I
mean, it's pretty awesome.

39:27.534 --> 39:29.390
- This inn is finally on the right track

39:29.390 --> 39:31.506
so it's time for me to say goodbye.

39:31.506 --> 39:32.820
Right, well done, good job.

39:32.820 --> 39:33.689
- Thank you chef.

39:33.689 --> 39:35.469
- Really good job indeed and do

39:35.469 --> 39:37.729
not let him back in this kitchen.

39:37.729 --> 39:38.598
- No sir.

39:38.598 --> 39:39.754
- No sir.

39:39.754 --> 39:42.382
- Right, tough one, we had our highs

39:42.382 --> 39:46.861
and lows but you are really
starting to grasp the potential.

39:46.861 --> 39:48.396
- Want to know another surprise?

39:48.396 --> 39:50.943
Everybody is going on
the payroll tomorrow.

39:50.943 --> 39:54.456
Everybody, they're all gonna
have a paycheck every week.

39:54.456 --> 39:55.325
- Really?

39:55.325 --> 39:56.194
- Yes.

39:56.194 --> 39:57.354
- That's music to my ears, I'm pleased

39:57.354 --> 39:59.378
to hear it, listen, good luck.

Gordon saved my lodge,
saved my ass, saved my life.

40:06.414 --> 40:09.801
- Sandy's running round like a new man.

40:09.801 --> 40:12.887
He's starting to look and
sound like an innkeeper.

40:12.887 --> 40:17.448
And if he keeps this up this gorgeous inn

40:17.448 --> 40:20.357
can become an amazing
place for a great weekend.

40:20.357 --> 40:25.571
Rumpole, let's go, come on boy,
come on boy you can't stay.

40:25.884 --> 40:27.951
Come on, come on, I know the room's nice

40:27.951 --> 40:32.547
but we got to go home,

40:32.547 --> 40:37.239

Let's go, here we go,

40:55.288 --> 40:57.165
Sometimes you can teach an old dog

40:57.165 --> 40:59.800
new tricks or at least
make him take a bath.

41:03.610 --> 41:04.667
Coming up.

41:04.667 --> 41:05.536
- Have a seat.

41:05.536 --> 41:08.030

41:33.284 --> 41:36.089
- Fantastic, that's all I
ever wanted to hear, man.

41:36.089 --> 41:37.487
- It's a team effort you got to

41:37.487 --> 41:39.551
have people that believe in you.

41:39.551 --> 41:41.223

41:42.381 --> 41:43.250
- Thank you.

41:43.250 --> 41:45.046
- No thank you.

41:45.046 --> 41:47.392
Thank you Gordon from
the bottom of my heart.

41:49.261 --> 41:50.239
If it hadn't been for you I would

41:50.239 --> 41:53.836
not be here, that is the truth, thank you.

41:58.546 --> 42:00.948
- [Gordon] And now all the
staff are backing Sandy

42:00.948 --> 42:03.683
to make Layla's Riverside Lodge a success.

42:05.181 --> 42:06.307
- Rich, you said you'd take it

42:06.307 --> 42:08.163
for the team brother, here we go.

42:08.163 --> 42:09.884
- [Gordon] Finally with
something to market,

42:09.884 --> 42:12.960
Richard is taking his sales
technique to a whole new level.

42:14.544 --> 42:17.287
- Oh yeah baby, come on Rich,

42:17.287 --> 42:19.383
let's go and have a look at the sign.

42:19.383 --> 42:21.377
- Wait, come here and hold my paw.
