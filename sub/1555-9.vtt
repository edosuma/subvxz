WEBVTT

00:02.245 --> 00:04.712
Of course, you
want me to track her down.

00:04.714 --> 00:06.280
Ms. Shaw, we had it all wrong.

00:06.282 --> 00:08.115
Mini isn't the guy
taking orders,

00:08.117 --> 00:09.550
he's the one giving them.

00:09.552 --> 00:10.884
Please! I'm
begging you, please!

00:10.886 --> 00:12.986
Dominic!

00:12.988 --> 00:14.321
Dominic.

00:14.323 --> 00:16.155
You want to take down Elias?

00:16.158 --> 00:18.459
You gotta play smarter.

00:18.461 --> 00:21.762
Is target present?

00:24.064 --> 00:25.563
No worries.

00:25.565 --> 00:26.830
I found her.

00:28.000 --> 00:34.074

00:35.174 --> 00:37.675
Your counter could really use
some love, hon.

00:37.677 --> 00:40.811
And maybe some disinfectant.

00:51.723 --> 00:54.558
I'm guessing now would be a good
time to ask for that raise, huh?

01:37.868 --> 01:39.569
Get on.

01:56.022 --> 01:57.269
_

01:57.352 --> 01:58.645
_

02:00.923 --> 02:02.390
Nice parking job.

02:02.392 --> 02:06.728
We're in a camera dead-zone.

02:06.730 --> 02:08.163
I'm guessing the psycho blonde
wasn't there

02:08.164 --> 02:10.531
for our free
tote bag promotion.

02:10.532 --> 02:11.800
No.

02:11.802 --> 02:13.668
Your cover's been blown.

02:17.506 --> 02:19.374
That's the last of it.

02:33.322 --> 02:36.490
You can let go now.

02:36.492 --> 02:37.925
I've got her, Harry.

02:37.927 --> 02:39.359
Oh, thank goodness.

02:39.361 --> 02:40.727
And you're okay, Ms. Shaw?

02:44.232 --> 02:48.169
If by "Okay," you mean,
"Ready to kick some righteous ass."

02:48.171 --> 02:49.904
I thought Samaritan
couldn't see us.

02:49.906 --> 02:51.172
It can't.

02:51.174 --> 02:52.672
But it's operatives can.

02:52.674 --> 02:54.040
Well, if I was
about to be capped,

02:54.042 --> 02:55.508
shouldn't my number
have come up?

02:55.510 --> 02:56.910
Assuming that the machine saw
the threat, yes.

02:56.912 --> 02:58.878
But the fact that it didn't
suggests

02:58.880 --> 03:00.246
that we're not the only ones
who've learned

03:00.248 --> 03:02.148
how to operate in the shadows.

03:02.150 --> 03:04.017
<i>Samaritan's
agents have, as well.</i>

03:04.019 --> 03:05.919
Look on the bright side,
Sameen.

03:05.921 --> 03:08.721
I'm pretty sure you just sold
you last tube of luminizer.

03:08.723 --> 03:10.222
<i>Indeed.</i>
<i>Ms. Shaw,</i>

03:10.224 --> 03:11.757
you and Ms. Groves
have to avoid all cameras

03:11.759 --> 03:13.392
and get back here as soon
as you can.

03:13.394 --> 03:15.093
Use the shadow map.

03:15.095 --> 03:18.397
Well, that's gonna be tricky
considering...

03:18.399 --> 03:21.033
we're in a truck with no clue
where we're heading.

03:21.035 --> 03:23.235
I have your location.

03:23.237 --> 03:24.570
And I'm sending assistance.

03:24.572 --> 03:26.705
So when we get back
to the subway...

03:26.707 --> 03:27.906
<i>then what?</i>

03:27.908 --> 03:29.208
Then we'll keep you safe.

03:29.210 --> 03:31.409
No, I mean,
what if we get a new number?

03:31.411 --> 03:33.278
Not to worry.

03:33.280 --> 03:36.381
I'm sure Mr. Reese can handle
anything that comes along.

03:46.726 --> 03:48.493
<i>Mr. Reese, have we
located our old friend?</i>

03:48.495 --> 03:50.294
I have.

03:50.296 --> 03:52.797
<i>For a wanted fugitive</i>
<i>whose life could be in danger,</i>

03:52.799 --> 03:55.132
he seems pretty relaxed.

03:55.134 --> 03:56.968
Perhaps we wouldn't be
if he knew how much information

03:56.970 --> 03:58.669
Dominic has on him.

03:58.671 --> 04:01.105
Those stolen NYPD files
<i>contain every member</i>

04:01.107 --> 04:04.408
of Elias' organization,
his business associates,

04:04.410 --> 04:06.643
and the structure
of his operation.

04:06.645 --> 04:09.413
Dominic wants to know his enemy
before making a move on him.

04:09.415 --> 04:11.015
<i>I have more troubling news.</i>

04:11.017 --> 04:13.918
Samaritan's agents have
discovered Ms. Shaw.

04:13.920 --> 04:16.086
What?
Is she okay?

04:16.088 --> 04:18.154
Yes, she's with Ms. Groves.

04:18.156 --> 04:19.623
I told them to come here.

04:19.625 --> 04:21.024
<i>Well, where are they now?</i>

04:21.026 --> 04:22.292
No, the ladies will have
to manage on their own.

04:22.294 --> 04:24.327
You need to stay on Elias.

04:24.329 --> 04:26.663
He's proved
to be a valuable ally

04:26.665 --> 04:28.965
during these uncertain times.

04:28.967 --> 04:31.167
And a principal force
keeping Dominic

04:31.169 --> 04:32.936
and The Brotherhood in check.

04:32.938 --> 04:34.670
He's the devil we know.

04:34.672 --> 04:39.175
<i>Yes, and whether we
like it or not, we need him.</i>

04:39.177 --> 04:41.044
It looks like
he's taking a meeting.

04:41.046 --> 04:42.545
How are you, Bruce?

04:47.718 --> 04:49.719
I recognize that man.

04:55.626 --> 04:57.493
His name is Bruce Moran.

04:57.495 --> 04:59.161
He's an investment advisor
and CPA

04:59.163 --> 05:00.396
based out of Brooklyn.

05:00.398 --> 05:02.765
Every mobster needs a money guy.

05:02.767 --> 05:05.867
You should've let me
meet you at your place.

05:05.869 --> 05:07.569
Would've been considerably
less visible.

05:07.571 --> 05:09.538
I enjoy the fresh air.

05:09.540 --> 05:10.973
Yeah.

05:10.975 --> 05:13.508
Well, don't enjoy it too much.

05:13.510 --> 05:15.411
Your concern is noted, Bruce.

05:15.413 --> 05:17.579
So how we doing?
How are the accounts?

05:17.581 --> 05:20.816
Fine...
for the most part.

05:20.818 --> 05:22.484
Feds are sniffing around again.

05:25.187 --> 05:27.155
Should I be concerned?

05:27.157 --> 05:29.825
Only if you had somebody
other than me handling it.

05:36.900 --> 05:38.666
Link.

05:38.668 --> 05:41.535
I think we were right
about Dominic's intentions.

05:41.537 --> 05:43.838
<i>The Brotherhood
is tracking Elias, too.</i>

05:43.840 --> 05:45.440
Can't say I'm surprised.

05:45.442 --> 05:47.875
Stay close to him, Mr. Reese.

05:59.188 --> 06:01.789
We're stopping.

06:05.193 --> 06:07.060
<i>Something wrong, Officer?</i>

06:07.062 --> 06:10.263
<i>Stay in the cab, please.</i>

06:17.571 --> 06:18.805
Come on, come on, come on.

06:23.277 --> 06:24.911
- Should I even ask?
- Really wanna know?

06:24.913 --> 06:26.779
Honestly?
No.

06:29.316 --> 06:30.917
Where are we on the shadow map?

06:30.919 --> 06:32.284
We're clear to the end
of this block.

06:32.286 --> 06:35.121
Let's go.

06:35.123 --> 06:37.123
You're all set.

06:43.230 --> 06:46.065
John, again so soon.

06:46.067 --> 06:47.666
You flatter me, Detective.

06:47.668 --> 06:49.768
It's not a social call, Elias.

06:49.770 --> 06:51.070
No, of course not.

06:51.072 --> 06:53.139
Whose guardian angel
are you this time?

06:53.141 --> 06:54.907
Yours.

06:54.909 --> 06:55.941
We believe Dominic
and The Brotherhood

06:55.943 --> 06:57.843
are coming for you.

06:57.845 --> 06:59.178
Really?

06:59.180 --> 07:00.913
Dominic stole a cache
of NYPD files

07:00.915 --> 07:02.814
on you and your organization.

07:02.816 --> 07:04.650
And his men have been
following you.

07:04.652 --> 07:06.018
So he's studying me.

07:06.020 --> 07:07.753
Oh, he'll do more than that.

07:07.755 --> 07:09.521
And you should know by now.

07:09.523 --> 07:12.190
If I say you're in danger,
you are.

07:12.192 --> 07:15.160
Oh, I believe you, John.

07:15.162 --> 07:16.161
Nevertheless,
I think I'm capable

07:16.163 --> 07:18.696
of handling the young lion.

07:18.698 --> 07:23.201
Like how the old Dons
thought they could handle you?

07:23.203 --> 07:25.036
Thanks for the warning,
Detective.

07:25.038 --> 07:27.038
Give Harold my best.

07:34.813 --> 07:36.047
How you doing, Ricky?

07:36.049 --> 07:38.049
Boss.

07:50.128 --> 07:52.362
Guess the young lion's
looking to be king.

07:53.966 --> 07:54.965
He's down here. Let's go.

07:54.967 --> 07:56.166
Is there another way out?

07:56.168 --> 07:57.501
If you know me at all, John,

07:57.503 --> 08:00.003
you know there's always
another way out.

08:04.836 --> 08:07.702
Sync and corrections by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

08:18.712 --> 08:20.213
I got it from here, thanks.

08:20.215 --> 08:21.214
You'll need help getting him out
of the city.

08:21.216 --> 08:22.315
Out of the city?

08:22.317 --> 08:23.683
It isn't safe for you here.

08:23.685 --> 08:24.951
You can't expect me
to run, John.

08:24.953 --> 08:26.151
I do that, I send a message

08:26.153 --> 08:28.053
to my people
that Dominic has won.

08:28.055 --> 08:29.889
Well, I won't help you
fight some gang war.

08:29.891 --> 08:31.457
Well, I'm not asking you to.

08:31.459 --> 08:32.859
But for as many times
as you and Harold

08:32.861 --> 08:34.293
have asked for my assistance,

08:34.294 --> 08:36.696
a little reciprocation
would be nice.

08:36.698 --> 08:38.798
What do you call me
saving your life back there?

08:38.799 --> 08:40.065
A good start.

08:40.067 --> 08:41.567
Now can we go?

08:46.506 --> 08:48.507
Come in. Come in, please.

08:48.509 --> 08:50.376
It's been too long.

08:50.378 --> 08:51.977
Really good to see you, Elias.

08:51.979 --> 08:53.245
You too, Gino.

08:53.247 --> 08:54.846
I hear things are good.

08:54.848 --> 08:56.382
Not bad.

08:56.384 --> 08:58.150
Got a couple of high stakes
poker games working.

08:58.152 --> 08:59.518
And the bookmaking's
rock steady.

08:59.520 --> 09:01.753
Well, you've always been
a good earner.

09:01.755 --> 09:03.421
And a good friend.

09:03.423 --> 09:05.991
So what brings you here?

09:05.993 --> 09:07.726
Sadly, an attempt on my life

09:07.728 --> 09:09.060
by The Brotherhood.

09:09.062 --> 09:10.962
My God, Elias.

09:10.964 --> 09:12.397
You okay?

09:12.399 --> 09:17.268
Mm. Thanks to the intervention
of some friends.

09:17.270 --> 09:20.771
But this action by Dominic,
it requires a response.

09:20.773 --> 09:22.773
Whatever you need.

09:22.775 --> 09:24.942
You know I got your back.

09:24.944 --> 09:28.346
<i>I'm glad to hear
you say that, Gino.</i>

09:37.022 --> 09:38.321
You okay?

09:38.323 --> 09:39.924
You seem a little distracted.

09:39.926 --> 09:41.825
I'm still just a little
in shock

09:41.827 --> 09:43.561
that Dominic would try
such a thing.

09:43.563 --> 09:44.962
I'm not.

09:44.964 --> 09:48.231
Nah, he's ambitious,
intelligent, I get it.

09:48.233 --> 09:51.101
I might even see how he could
look like a good bet

09:51.103 --> 09:52.102
to some people.

10:01.812 --> 10:03.046
Easy.

10:03.048 --> 10:05.081
Everyone, relax.

10:05.083 --> 10:06.950
We're just talking.

10:10.287 --> 10:12.288
So he got to you.

10:12.290 --> 10:13.957
He didn't give me any choice.

10:13.959 --> 10:14.991
And you've been out
of the picture so long,

10:14.993 --> 10:16.659
people started talking.

10:16.661 --> 10:17.894
Saying what?

10:17.896 --> 10:21.297
You're vulnerable.

10:21.299 --> 10:22.731
Well...

10:22.733 --> 10:24.967
if he was able to turn you,
my dear Gino,

10:24.969 --> 10:29.738
I can only imagine
that he's approached everyone.

10:29.740 --> 10:32.874
Do you know if he's gotten
to Bruce?

10:32.876 --> 10:34.510
I don't.

10:34.512 --> 10:37.580
How much time
before he gets here?

10:37.582 --> 10:39.915
Probably under a minute.

10:39.917 --> 10:42.651
We're leaving now.

10:42.653 --> 10:45.954
Elias, I was only protecting
my business.

10:45.956 --> 10:47.489
We'll be seeing you, Gino.

10:56.233 --> 10:58.433
Hello, my dear.

10:58.435 --> 10:59.434
You have news?

10:59.436 --> 11:01.068
I found Shaw but she escaped.

11:01.070 --> 11:05.973
Yes, I assume with the help
of Ms. Groves.

11:05.975 --> 11:07.642
<i>Something else.</i>

11:07.644 --> 11:09.710
When I located Shaw,
Samaritan couldn't see her.

11:09.712 --> 11:10.811
Like it was blind.

11:10.813 --> 11:12.647
<i>Blind?</i>

11:12.649 --> 11:16.183
That would explain their ability
to avoid detection.

11:16.185 --> 11:17.852
The question is,

11:17.854 --> 11:19.620
how are they accomplishing
<i>such a thing?</i>

11:19.622 --> 11:20.821
I found the truck
they were hiding in

11:20.823 --> 11:22.389
but they were already gone.

11:22.391 --> 11:25.059
It was pulled over
in a dead-zone by a detective.

11:25.061 --> 11:26.460
I'm looking into it.

11:26.462 --> 11:29.463
Keep me apprised.

11:32.442 --> 11:34.462
_

11:36.070 --> 11:39.105
Finch can't expect Reese
to pick up all the numbers.

11:39.107 --> 11:41.040
He's still got a day job.

11:41.042 --> 11:43.844
I'm sure Harry will find
a solution.

11:43.846 --> 11:45.411
Well, I already have.

11:45.413 --> 11:49.082
The machine needs
to give me a new identity.

11:49.084 --> 11:51.550
Sorry, Sam, it doesn't work
like that.

11:51.552 --> 11:53.219
Why not?

11:53.221 --> 11:54.954
I mean, it works
like that for you.

11:54.956 --> 11:56.289
You go through identities
like they're Dixie Cups.

11:56.291 --> 11:57.290
But I'm one and done?

11:57.292 --> 11:59.058
I don't make the rules.

11:59.060 --> 12:01.059
She does.

12:01.061 --> 12:02.995
Look, I get
that you're frustrated,

12:02.997 --> 12:04.997
angry, and probably
a little bit scared--

12:04.999 --> 12:06.432
Oh, please.
I'm not scared.

12:06.434 --> 12:08.868
Well, maybe you should be.

12:08.870 --> 12:10.903
Because you almost died
back there.

12:10.905 --> 12:13.773
And Samaritan's operatives are
just getting smarter and faster.

12:13.775 --> 12:15.941
So while you may not be scared
about what could happen to you

12:15.943 --> 12:19.744
the next time,
other people are.

12:19.746 --> 12:24.082
People who care for you.

12:24.084 --> 12:27.152
Try to remember that.

12:27.154 --> 12:29.154
We need to keep moving.

12:43.268 --> 12:44.502
I tried to stall him, Dominic,

12:44.504 --> 12:46.003
but he had men with him.

12:46.005 --> 12:48.440
Sounds like one of them
is Detective Riley.

12:48.442 --> 12:50.341
Just tell me what he said.

12:50.343 --> 12:51.943
Asking about who you've been
talking to.

12:51.945 --> 12:53.945
If you had any dealings
with Bruce.

12:53.947 --> 12:54.946
Who's that?

12:54.948 --> 12:56.280
His accountant.

12:56.282 --> 12:57.815
<i>We got a file on him.</i>

12:57.817 --> 13:03.154
He was over there
on the boardwalk with Elias.

13:03.156 --> 13:04.688
Tell me about him.

13:04.690 --> 13:06.490
Only met him a couple of times.

13:06.492 --> 13:07.758
Guy's practically a ghost.

13:07.760 --> 13:09.593
But he's tight with Elias.

13:09.595 --> 13:13.330
Handles his money,
advises him on his business.

13:13.332 --> 13:15.031
That's all I know.

13:15.033 --> 13:17.701
Hmm.

13:17.703 --> 13:20.671
Don't worry so much, Gino.

13:20.673 --> 13:23.440
You'll have more territory
than you ever did under Elias.

13:23.442 --> 13:24.674
That's not what
I'm worried about.

13:24.676 --> 13:26.009
What then?

13:26.011 --> 13:29.446
Elias is still out there.

13:29.448 --> 13:30.447
Not for long.

13:40.657 --> 13:43.860
Our boys are all over Brooklyn
looking for him.

13:43.862 --> 13:45.361
Elias will turn up.

13:45.363 --> 13:49.632
Why would Elias be so concerned
about an accountant?

13:49.634 --> 13:50.700
He's his money guy.

13:50.702 --> 13:52.502
He's much more than that.

13:52.504 --> 13:57.806
Elias took out the Russians,
the Dons, busted out of prison,

13:57.808 --> 14:00.075
and went fugitive.

14:00.077 --> 14:03.078
All that and he stayed on top.

14:03.080 --> 14:04.046
The man's smart.

14:04.048 --> 14:06.348
The man had help.

14:06.350 --> 14:10.386
When Elias was inside,
he had somebody pulling strings

14:10.388 --> 14:11.586
on the outside.

14:11.588 --> 14:12.988
Mm.

14:12.990 --> 14:15.557
When he went underground,
always had somebody

14:15.559 --> 14:19.193
above ground, handling business.

14:19.195 --> 14:22.531
This accountant, we find him,

14:22.533 --> 14:25.333
and we find Elias.

14:36.512 --> 14:38.413
Nice place.

14:38.415 --> 14:40.548
It's my building.
I bought it.

14:40.550 --> 14:42.383
To become a slumlord?

14:42.385 --> 14:43.918
To renovate it.

14:43.920 --> 14:45.753
So far, only the penthouse
has been completed.

14:45.755 --> 14:47.521
We need to get you
some place safe.

14:47.523 --> 14:48.589
Lay low.

14:48.591 --> 14:50.090
Why stop here?

14:50.092 --> 14:51.692
My accountant has his office
here.

14:51.694 --> 14:53.460
And I need to pick something up.

14:53.462 --> 14:55.395
Something valuable.

14:55.397 --> 14:56.797
All right.
It better be.

14:58.233 --> 15:00.200
It's The Brotherhood.
They found us.

15:00.202 --> 15:02.869
Take the rear exit.
Go now.

15:12.813 --> 15:15.949
They got the back door covered.

15:15.951 --> 15:17.050
We need a way out of here.

15:17.052 --> 15:19.385
What are we waiting for?

15:19.387 --> 15:20.419
Does that go to a basement exit?

15:20.421 --> 15:22.254
No.
The penthouse.

15:22.256 --> 15:23.823
We'll be cornered up there.

15:23.825 --> 15:24.924
Well, it's either be
cornered upstairs,

15:24.926 --> 15:26.559
or dead down here.

15:27.562 --> 15:30.630
I'm opting for the former.

15:30.632 --> 15:32.565
Come on, John, have some faith.

15:51.419 --> 15:52.719
<i>Mr. Reese,
I heard gunfire.</i>

15:52.721 --> 15:54.354
<i>Are you all right?</i>

15:54.356 --> 15:56.055
We're okay, but The Brotherhood
has us trapped

15:56.057 --> 15:57.790
in an apartment building
and we're running out of floors.

15:57.792 --> 15:59.025
Perhaps under the circumstances,

15:59.027 --> 16:00.893
you should call
for police backup.

16:00.895 --> 16:04.130
I would, but your chess partner
here, he's a wanted man.

16:04.132 --> 16:05.999
I call it in,
he goes back to jail.

16:06.001 --> 16:08.434
We'd be sending him to Dominic
on a platter.

16:08.436 --> 16:11.203
Then I'll alert Detective Fusco.

16:11.205 --> 16:12.872
Hopefully, he'll be firepower
enough.

16:23.350 --> 16:25.184
What is it now, Glasses?

16:25.186 --> 16:27.686
<i>Detective, I
hope you're not busy.</i>

16:27.688 --> 16:29.622
Why, you need me to rescue
Lucy and Ethel again?

16:29.624 --> 16:31.624
No, but it's something
equally urgent.

16:31.626 --> 16:33.258
<i>Detective Fusco?</i>

16:35.394 --> 16:37.462
Hang on.

16:37.464 --> 16:38.797
Yeah, can I help you?

16:38.799 --> 16:40.966
Charlene Jacobs, DEA.

16:40.968 --> 16:42.734
My office heard
about a drug stop you made.

16:42.736 --> 16:44.736
<i>A couple of movers in a truck?</i>

16:46.939 --> 16:47.939
Yeah, what about them?

16:47.941 --> 16:49.774
Oh, no.

16:49.776 --> 16:52.544
Wanna tell me why a Homicide detective
was making a drug stop?

16:55.981 --> 16:58.082
The task force I'm in
is authorized to stop trucks

16:58.084 --> 17:00.285
as part of a joint sting op
with Narcotics.

17:00.287 --> 17:02.687
Hmm.
That sounds unconventional.

17:02.689 --> 17:05.489
Local DEA was notified.

17:05.491 --> 17:08.159
Who's the lead agent over there?
Uh, Chambers?

17:08.161 --> 17:10.227
Knows all about it.

17:10.229 --> 17:12.797
You work with him, right?

17:12.799 --> 17:15.566
He didn't read you in?

17:15.568 --> 17:16.567
No.

17:16.569 --> 17:18.468
Hmm.

17:18.470 --> 17:22.239
Interagency communication
at its best.

17:22.241 --> 17:24.273
I'll take care of that
right now.

17:24.276 --> 17:26.210
That's okay, Detective.

17:28.145 --> 17:30.947
He probably just hasn't gotten
around to it yet.

17:30.949 --> 17:34.150
Thank you for your time.

17:34.152 --> 17:36.320
You bet.

17:40.290 --> 17:42.358
Hey, I was being questioned
about our lady pals.

17:42.360 --> 17:44.160
I know, I was listening
and watching you

17:44.162 --> 17:46.696
from the camera on your desk.

17:46.698 --> 17:49.966
I hate when you do that.

17:49.968 --> 17:52.501
Never mind.
That woman is not DEA.

17:52.503 --> 17:53.970
Gee, you think?

17:53.972 --> 17:55.104
<i>So who is she?</i>

17:55.106 --> 17:57.039
She's an agent of sorts.

17:57.041 --> 17:59.542
And one we should avoid.

17:59.544 --> 18:02.010
When you called earlier,
you need something?

18:02.012 --> 18:04.813
Oh, never mind.

18:04.815 --> 18:07.015
Nothing to worry about,
Detective.

18:07.017 --> 18:10.018
You just carry on
with your normal work routine.

18:10.020 --> 18:11.820
You bet.
Hey, speaking of work,

18:11.822 --> 18:13.655
you haven't seen
my so-called partner, have you?

18:13.657 --> 18:15.323
John's working a case.

18:15.325 --> 18:17.359
A homicide?

18:17.361 --> 18:18.894
Let's hope not.

18:25.235 --> 18:26.301
All clear.

18:26.303 --> 18:27.636
Your accountant's not here.

18:27.638 --> 18:30.305
Just as well,
given the situation.

18:30.307 --> 18:32.240
Sure beats the hell
out of the lobby.

18:32.242 --> 18:34.909
Thanks.
I designed it myself.

18:37.714 --> 18:39.681
Elias, we don't need money,
we need a way out.

18:39.683 --> 18:42.216
Yes, and what have I told you?

18:45.821 --> 18:47.388
Always another way out.

18:47.390 --> 18:49.523
A holdover
from the previous owners.

18:49.525 --> 18:51.425
I kept it for an occasion
such as this.

18:51.427 --> 18:52.426
We need to go now.

18:52.428 --> 18:53.828
Not yet.

18:53.830 --> 18:56.164
Forget it, there's no time.
Elias!

18:57.901 --> 18:59.600
- Move! Now!
- John, no, wait, wait!

18:59.602 --> 19:01.234
Move! Move!

19:01.236 --> 19:03.404
<i>- Take 'em out!</i>
<i>- Go!</i>

19:14.517 --> 19:15.949
Go!

19:15.951 --> 19:17.717
Anthony!

19:17.719 --> 19:21.188
No, you stay here.

19:21.190 --> 19:23.623
It's too dangerous.
Keep moving.

19:25.741 --> 19:28.371
_

19:31.566 --> 19:33.299
Samaritan operatives.

19:37.538 --> 19:39.572
Any status updates, Ms. Shaw?

19:39.574 --> 19:42.375
Yeah, one.
We're still breathing.

19:42.377 --> 19:44.711
<i>Good. The sooner
you get here, the better.</i>

19:44.713 --> 19:46.546
The operative that you
encountered

19:46.548 --> 19:48.948
just questioned
Detective Fusco.

19:48.950 --> 19:51.884
He may have thrown her off
<i>your scent, for now.</i>

19:51.886 --> 19:53.418
Attaboy, Lionel.

19:53.420 --> 19:55.454
I'll be in touch when I can.

19:55.456 --> 19:58.891
But for the moment,
I need to assist Mr. Reese.

19:58.893 --> 20:01.927
Assist how?
You mean with a number?

20:01.929 --> 20:03.963
That's none of your concern,
Ms. Shaw.

20:03.965 --> 20:05.497
Well, is John in some kind
of trouble?

20:05.499 --> 20:08.567
I mean, who's the number?

20:08.569 --> 20:10.736
Harold.

20:10.738 --> 20:13.505
Carl Elias.

20:13.507 --> 20:14.806
John's running with the mob?

20:14.808 --> 20:16.341
<i>I'm there.</i>
<i>Where is he?</i>

20:16.343 --> 20:18.309
I'm sorry,
that's out of the question.

20:18.311 --> 20:19.578
Harold.

20:19.580 --> 20:23.414
Good-bye, Ms. Shaw.

20:23.416 --> 20:24.749
What the hell does he think
he's doing?

20:24.751 --> 20:25.984
Trying to protect you.

20:25.986 --> 20:27.852
I don't need protection, okay?

20:27.854 --> 20:30.321
I do the protecting.

20:30.323 --> 20:31.856
Now, do you know where John is?

20:31.858 --> 20:33.791
Sameen, we already have
a mission.

20:33.793 --> 20:35.393
That means "Yes."
Tell me.

20:35.395 --> 20:37.161
Tell me.
Root!

20:38.663 --> 20:40.531
Please.

20:42.934 --> 20:44.368
Cute, but--

20:44.370 --> 20:46.871
If you don't tell me
where John is right now,

20:46.873 --> 20:49.373
I'm not going any further.

20:49.375 --> 20:50.674
Samaritan's goons can just come

20:50.676 --> 20:54.111
and blast us into
the next dimension.

20:56.680 --> 20:57.948
Fine.

20:57.950 --> 20:59.516
But we use the shadow map
to get there.

20:59.518 --> 21:02.252
And as soon as we help John,
you promise to go underground.

21:02.254 --> 21:04.021
Deal.

21:07.325 --> 21:09.226
In here.

21:09.228 --> 21:10.627
Take that room.

21:10.629 --> 21:12.529
They're cutting us off.

21:12.531 --> 21:15.364
This way.

21:27.244 --> 21:28.545
<i>Homey.</i>

21:28.547 --> 21:30.012
Anything but.

21:30.014 --> 21:33.749
Dominic will have his men going
floor by floor.

21:33.751 --> 21:36.385
We can't stay hidden forever.

21:36.387 --> 21:38.487
And we can't blast out way
out of here.

21:38.489 --> 21:40.756
We're gonna need
an escape route.

21:40.758 --> 21:44.893
Elias, I could use
your help here.

21:44.895 --> 21:47.996
They shot Anthony.

21:47.998 --> 21:49.331
Dominic wanted my attention.

21:49.333 --> 21:50.766
Well, now he has it.

22:00.276 --> 22:02.077
<i>Elias...</i>

22:02.079 --> 22:04.045
looks like you left in a hurry.

22:04.047 --> 22:06.514
Left some things behind.

22:06.516 --> 22:08.850
Is Anthony alive?

22:08.852 --> 22:11.052
For the moment.

22:11.054 --> 22:12.187
<i>What do you want?</i>

22:12.189 --> 22:13.888
You should know.

22:13.890 --> 22:16.091
You wanted all
the same things once.

22:16.093 --> 22:17.792
And you got it.

22:17.794 --> 22:19.527
When you took out the Dons.

22:19.529 --> 22:21.729
And now you want to do the same
thing to me, is that it?

22:21.731 --> 22:24.365
It's the natural order
of things.

22:24.367 --> 22:26.534
The old makes way for the new.

22:26.536 --> 22:28.068
<i>It's my time now.</i>

22:28.070 --> 22:29.871
All right, you called me
for a reason.

22:29.873 --> 22:31.739
What is it?

22:31.741 --> 22:33.741
I'll show you the respect
of talking to you straight.

22:33.743 --> 22:35.809
We both know how
this ends for you.

22:35.811 --> 22:37.611
But if you give yourself up,

22:37.613 --> 22:43.783
your man and Detective Riley
<i>can walk out of here.</i>

22:43.785 --> 22:46.620
Deal seems pretty one-sided.

22:46.622 --> 22:49.390
Only one you're gonna get.

22:49.392 --> 22:54.127
You can take it,
or no one leaves here alive.

22:54.129 --> 22:56.229
You've still got some power,
Elias.

22:56.231 --> 23:00.734
Question is what are you gonna
do with it?

23:21.355 --> 23:22.922
It's all clear, let's go.

23:28.195 --> 23:29.562
You can't give yourself up.

23:29.564 --> 23:30.663
He'll kill you.

23:30.665 --> 23:32.431
I suspect he will.

23:32.433 --> 23:34.667
But there's a chance
he'll let you and Anthony go.

23:34.669 --> 23:36.969
And a better chance
he kills us all.

23:36.971 --> 23:38.738
Dominic's smart.

23:38.740 --> 23:41.440
He won't kill a detective
if he doesn't have to.

23:41.442 --> 23:43.842
And Anthony--
Anthony saved my life

23:43.844 --> 23:45.411
more than a few times
over the years.

23:45.413 --> 23:46.912
What kind of man would I be

23:46.914 --> 23:48.547
if I didn't try
and return the favor.

23:48.549 --> 23:49.749
A live one.

23:49.751 --> 23:51.116
Now I'm gonna get you
out of here.

23:51.118 --> 23:54.452
And once I do,
I'll come back for Anthony.

23:54.454 --> 23:56.588
You are nothing
if not magnanimous, John,

23:56.590 --> 23:57.689
but I'm afraid--

23:57.691 --> 23:59.892
There's nothing to discuss here.

23:59.894 --> 24:01.493
We tried it your way.

24:01.495 --> 24:03.295
Now we're doing it mine.

24:03.297 --> 24:05.764
Dominic won't kill Anthony
unless he has you.

24:05.766 --> 24:07.932
And I'm not gonna let
that happen.

24:14.907 --> 24:17.542
Do remember the last time
you handed me a firearm?

24:17.544 --> 24:18.743
You aimed it at my head.

24:18.745 --> 24:20.745
Don't make me regret it again.

24:27.485 --> 24:29.921
How much money you think
is in there.

24:29.923 --> 24:32.056
We're not looking
for money, Link.

24:33.626 --> 24:36.160
Guy like Elias knows
there's more to playing the game

24:36.162 --> 24:39.363
than just money.

24:39.365 --> 24:42.633
There's the game
within the game.

24:42.635 --> 24:45.302
To play that,
you need influence.

24:45.304 --> 24:47.003
- Power.
- Leverage.

24:47.005 --> 24:50.106
And not the kind you buy.

24:50.108 --> 24:52.643
The kind you build.

24:52.645 --> 24:55.512
Takes information.

24:55.514 --> 24:57.981
Secrets.

24:57.983 --> 24:59.482
Elias knew we were
coming for him

24:59.484 --> 25:02.085
but he came here anyway.
Why?

25:02.087 --> 25:03.720
Because of this.

25:03.722 --> 25:05.688
You wanna run the streets?

25:05.690 --> 25:08.091
Hearts and minds.

25:08.093 --> 25:11.427
You wanna run the whole city?

25:11.429 --> 25:14.230
It's gonna take more
than just money.

25:14.232 --> 25:15.865
And I'm tired
of waiting for it.

25:23.507 --> 25:27.643
What's the combination?

25:27.645 --> 25:29.678
I told you.

25:29.680 --> 25:33.548
I don't know it.

25:33.550 --> 25:35.550
Elias hasn't called back.

25:35.552 --> 25:37.987
He's left you here to die.

25:37.989 --> 25:39.654
But not die alone.

25:39.656 --> 25:44.960
Die with me.

25:44.962 --> 25:47.462
You're Italian, right?

25:47.464 --> 25:49.998
Your ancestors were Romans.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.634
You know what the Romans did
when they marched on a country?

25:52.636 --> 25:55.303
They gave the king a choice.

25:55.305 --> 25:59.340
Join or die.

25:59.342 --> 26:03.411
Those that joined,
they flourished with the Empire.

26:03.413 --> 26:08.582
Those that didn't...

26:08.584 --> 26:12.186
Either way, the Romans
took the country.

26:12.188 --> 26:14.555
This isn't just about Elias.

26:14.557 --> 26:18.359
This is about a regime change.

26:18.361 --> 26:20.828
I can give you your own crew.

26:20.830 --> 26:23.898
Your own territory.

26:23.900 --> 26:27.802
You can flourish.

26:27.804 --> 26:30.103
You smart enough to understand
what I'm saying?

26:30.105 --> 26:32.105
Hmm.

26:34.676 --> 26:36.410
Guess not.

26:36.412 --> 26:37.544
Unh!

26:37.546 --> 26:40.747
What's the smell?

26:40.749 --> 26:42.715
Decades of rot beneath
the floorboard

26:42.717 --> 26:45.285
combined with a broken
ventilation system.

26:45.287 --> 26:48.088
The previous owners never
put any money into this place.

26:48.090 --> 26:50.290
And you said,
"I gotta have it."

26:50.292 --> 26:52.725
I saw an opportunity.

26:52.727 --> 26:53.960
Take a blight
on the neighborhood

26:53.962 --> 26:55.361
and give it a new purpose.

26:55.363 --> 26:59.031
Create a legacy of sorts.

26:59.033 --> 27:01.434
Come on.

27:07.395 --> 27:08.685
<i>Over here.</i>

27:25.758 --> 27:27.392
You okay?

27:27.394 --> 27:29.828
Fine.

27:29.830 --> 27:32.097
Just don't like this room.

27:39.171 --> 27:40.873
<i>Finch, what's
the story with Fusco?</i>

27:40.875 --> 27:42.407
The detective is unavailable.

27:42.409 --> 27:43.641
<i>You have me.</i>
<i>I'm down the street.</i>

27:43.643 --> 27:45.143
<i>What's your situation?</i>

27:45.145 --> 27:46.644
<i>We're on the third floor here.</i>

27:46.646 --> 27:48.313
I need to know which exit
we should try for.

27:48.315 --> 27:50.281
I'm using the penthouse's
wi-fi network

27:50.283 --> 27:52.150
as a sort of passive
radar system

27:52.152 --> 27:54.486
to image the building
floor by floor.

27:54.488 --> 27:57.455
But I'm afraid none of the exits
look very promising.

27:57.457 --> 27:59.323
Just give me your best bad
option then.

27:59.325 --> 28:01.993
All right, the southeast side
of the building.

28:01.995 --> 28:03.861
It's further from the street
<i>and in all likelihood,</i>

28:03.863 --> 28:05.162
<i>least guarded.</i>

28:05.164 --> 28:06.631
We're heading that way now.

28:06.633 --> 28:09.667
<i>I'll met you there.</i>

28:10.235 --> 28:11.701
_

28:16.541 --> 28:19.476
I'm done waiting on Elias.

28:19.478 --> 28:21.678
His man's gotta know something.

28:21.680 --> 28:25.015
Squeeze him hard enough,
he'll leak.

28:33.824 --> 28:36.526
You looking to get
your licks in, too?

28:36.528 --> 28:38.791
No need.

28:42.500 --> 28:44.801
I think Dominic's wrong
about you.

28:44.803 --> 28:46.169
You don't know the combination.

28:46.171 --> 28:49.705
If you did, you'd put
a stop to all this.

28:49.707 --> 28:52.975
You're his right hand man,
yeah?

28:52.977 --> 28:55.578
Yeah, something like that.

28:55.580 --> 28:59.082
It's not easy being number two.

29:02.286 --> 29:07.222
You better take Dominic's
offer before it's too late.

29:07.224 --> 29:10.158
You could be your own man.
Have your own crew.

29:10.160 --> 29:15.631
I already got a crew.

29:15.633 --> 29:18.986
And a boss I'd lay down
my life for.

29:20.170 --> 29:23.338
You really ready to do that?

29:23.340 --> 29:26.508
A question you better ask
yourself.

29:26.510 --> 29:30.545
'Cause someday, you might find
yourself sitting in a chair

29:30.547 --> 29:33.410
looks a hell
of a lot like this one.

29:36.120 --> 29:38.419
John, I appreciate the risk
you're taking

29:38.421 --> 29:40.722
for me and Anthony.

29:40.724 --> 29:42.423
Anthony.

29:42.425 --> 29:45.025
Always just thought of him
as Scarface.

29:45.027 --> 29:47.027
We go way back.

29:47.029 --> 29:48.929
Prison?

29:48.931 --> 29:49.930
Close.

29:49.932 --> 29:51.531
Group home.

29:51.533 --> 29:53.399
Anthony transferred
in from juvie,

29:53.401 --> 29:55.435
where he served the better
part of his childhood

29:55.437 --> 29:58.271
for killing his father.

29:58.273 --> 30:01.374
That's how he got his scar.

30:01.376 --> 30:03.943
He got fed up with the old man
beating on his mom.

30:03.945 --> 30:06.979
Stepped in one night,
slit his throat.

30:06.981 --> 30:09.628
As you can imagine,
we hit it right off.

30:12.987 --> 30:15.655
I suppose it was inevitable
this day would come.

30:15.657 --> 30:18.463
It's coming for us all.

30:19.961 --> 30:23.495
You ever wonder how much
you're willing to take?

30:23.497 --> 30:25.665
How much further you can go?

30:25.667 --> 30:28.000
Sometimes.

30:28.002 --> 30:31.137
Right now I just want
to get as far as the exit.

30:37.177 --> 30:39.444
No cameras.

30:39.446 --> 30:40.679
Remember our deal.

30:40.681 --> 30:42.514
We do this, and
then straight to the subway.

30:42.516 --> 30:44.115
Yeah, yeah.
You're killing the mood.

30:58.030 --> 30:59.764
Are you sure this is the place?

30:59.766 --> 31:01.599
Sorry, sweetie.

31:01.601 --> 31:05.336
You didn't leave me any choice.

31:10.008 --> 31:13.177
I will end you.

31:13.179 --> 31:15.813
You can end me all you want.

31:18.050 --> 31:19.950
Right after your nap.

31:23.387 --> 31:26.056
Finch, we're at
the southeast exit.

31:26.058 --> 31:27.657
<i>The guards will return shortly.</i>

31:27.659 --> 31:29.860
Hurry, Mr. Reese.

31:29.862 --> 31:32.996
Come on, let's go.

31:32.998 --> 31:35.769
John, I'm so sorry.

31:37.636 --> 31:39.001
Damn it, Elias.

31:39.003 --> 31:40.270
I'd prefer not to
shoot you, John.

31:40.272 --> 31:42.004
We had a plan.

31:42.006 --> 31:44.073
Two plans, actually.

31:44.075 --> 31:46.409
Yours, where you save my life.

31:46.411 --> 31:48.811
And mine, where I save yours.

31:48.813 --> 31:50.413
Can't let you back in there.

31:50.415 --> 31:53.916
Not even you can survive
a building full of guns.

31:53.918 --> 31:57.353
Though I know you'd try.

31:57.355 --> 31:59.956
Do you really think Dominic's
gonna let Anthony go?

31:59.958 --> 32:02.759
We'll find out soon enough.

32:15.672 --> 32:17.273
<i>Yes?</i>

32:17.275 --> 32:19.040
Mr. Elias, please.
You can't just give yourself up.

32:19.042 --> 32:20.342
Harold.

32:20.344 --> 32:22.077
Your persistence is
commendable.

32:22.079 --> 32:24.580
I understand your wanting
to save your friend.

32:24.582 --> 32:27.616
But you must know that there's
more hanging in the balance here

32:27.618 --> 32:29.217
<i>than just his life.</i>

32:29.219 --> 32:32.187
Perhaps, but his is the one
that I care about.

32:32.189 --> 32:34.555
There's no denying
that your presence in this city

32:34.557 --> 32:37.092
has brought order to the chaos.

32:37.094 --> 32:40.295
<i>Without you,</i>
<i>men like Dominic will thrive,</i>

32:40.297 --> 32:43.031
and violence can claim
many more lives.

32:43.033 --> 32:44.432
The world is a violent place,
Harold.

32:44.434 --> 32:47.101
It always will be.

32:47.103 --> 32:48.736
Best we can hope to do
while we're here

32:48.738 --> 32:51.390
is protect those closest to us.

32:58.980 --> 33:00.315
Good-bye, Harold.

33:13.297 --> 33:14.996
I'm back in Finch.
Headed for the penthouse.

33:14.998 --> 33:16.599
<i>Wait, Mr. Reese.</i>

33:16.601 --> 33:17.833
I see people moving around
in a large room

33:17.835 --> 33:19.768
at the west end
of the third floor.

33:19.770 --> 33:22.104
It could be Elias.

33:27.009 --> 33:31.679
I have to say, I respect you
for turning yourself over.

33:31.681 --> 33:33.749
Running doesn't suit men
like us.

33:33.751 --> 33:35.183
Neither does breaking
your word.

33:35.185 --> 33:36.251
You have what you want.

33:36.253 --> 33:37.786
Now let Anthony go.

33:37.788 --> 33:40.355
Just one more thing.

33:40.357 --> 33:42.490
Gonna need the code
to the vault.

33:42.492 --> 33:44.459
Oh, that wasn't part
of the deal.

33:44.461 --> 33:46.527
Deal's been amended.

33:46.529 --> 33:47.962
Standard rider.

33:47.964 --> 33:51.832
To the victor goes the spoils.

33:51.834 --> 33:53.334
Is Anthony even still alive?

34:04.046 --> 34:05.112
Hey.

34:05.114 --> 34:06.564
<i>Put him on.</i>

34:18.225 --> 34:19.525
Boss?

34:19.527 --> 34:21.695
How you doing, Anthony?

34:21.697 --> 34:24.230
I've seen worse.

34:28.235 --> 34:30.235
They want inside the vault.

34:30.237 --> 34:32.571
Well, and I want them
to release you.

34:44.351 --> 34:47.753
Boss, I think we should
just give them the code.

34:47.755 --> 34:50.447
I want them to let you go first.

34:53.761 --> 34:55.928
I don't think that's gonna
happen.

35:00.500 --> 35:03.802
Please, boss.

35:03.804 --> 35:05.370
I just want it to be done.

35:10.877 --> 35:13.445
Okay, Anthony.

35:13.447 --> 35:15.547
That's enough.

35:15.549 --> 35:20.585
<i>You've gone far enough.</i>

35:25.023 --> 35:27.726
One...

35:27.728 --> 35:29.361
zero..

35:29.363 --> 35:31.629
three...

35:31.631 --> 35:32.637
zero...

35:37.370 --> 35:39.036
seven...

35:39.038 --> 35:41.138
four.

35:46.879 --> 35:52.249
Mr. Reese, there's something
curious about that vault.

35:52.251 --> 35:55.118
I gotta give you credit.

35:55.120 --> 35:58.822
You studied your enemy,
you infiltrated my organization,

35:58.824 --> 36:03.560
you identified my weakness,
and you exploited it.

36:03.562 --> 36:05.161
Sun Tzu would be impressed.

36:07.232 --> 36:09.732
Wait...

36:09.734 --> 36:11.434
Oh, my--

36:11.436 --> 36:14.771
But I've learned something
over the years.

36:14.773 --> 36:17.007
While it's important
to know your enemy's weakness,

36:17.009 --> 36:20.510
it's just as important
to know your own.

36:20.512 --> 36:22.835
Do you know yours, Dominic?

36:26.150 --> 36:27.683
Hubris.

36:36.326 --> 36:37.927
Dominic, what's up?

36:37.929 --> 36:39.128
<i>The code.</i>

36:39.130 --> 36:40.495
Tell him to stop.

36:40.497 --> 36:41.314
Hold up!

36:41.424 --> 36:43.418
_

36:44.035 --> 36:46.101
As the Romans said...

36:46.103 --> 36:49.204
<i>morior invictus.</i>

36:54.044 --> 36:56.511
Get out!

37:05.354 --> 37:08.156
You think that changes anything?

37:08.158 --> 37:10.692
I still won.

37:10.694 --> 37:13.222
Then why aren't you smiling?

37:21.170 --> 37:22.754
Elias, go!

37:53.267 --> 37:55.135
How much did Root give her?

37:55.137 --> 37:59.172
Enough to stop a bull,
apparently.

37:59.174 --> 38:01.641
She's gonna be madder
than one when she comes to.

38:01.643 --> 38:03.643
I'm afraid we can no choice.

38:03.645 --> 38:05.545
Ms. Shaw's cover is blown.

38:05.547 --> 38:09.413
Our survival now depends
on her seclusion.

38:11.553 --> 38:13.452
So how do we proceed now,
Harold?

38:13.454 --> 38:16.556
With extreme caution,
Mr. Reese.

38:16.558 --> 38:18.124
The events of the past few days

38:18.126 --> 38:19.758
have made our world
more dangerous

38:19.760 --> 38:21.555
than ever before.

38:22.530 --> 38:24.397
Perhaps we should
let her sleep.

38:27.700 --> 38:29.735
Samaritan ran a diagnostic
on itself.

38:29.737 --> 38:31.603
No flaws were detected.

38:31.605 --> 38:32.971
I don't understand.

38:32.973 --> 38:34.140
How could it have missed her?

38:34.142 --> 38:35.641
Any of them?

38:35.643 --> 38:38.076
I believe the machine
is blinding Samaritan

38:38.078 --> 38:39.912
by blocking all
the relevant data

38:39.914 --> 38:42.981
on Mr. Finch
and his associates.

38:42.983 --> 38:44.249
How can we fix that?

38:44.251 --> 38:46.284
Human intelligence.

38:46.286 --> 38:49.555
You, Martine, must now be
Samaritan's eyes.

38:49.557 --> 38:52.736
So I'm expanding
your capabilities.

39:00.222 --> 39:03.924
_

39:06.004 --> 39:08.151
Happy hunting.

39:15.914 --> 39:18.683
Looks like Elias picked up
stakes.

39:18.685 --> 39:20.751
Could be on the run.

39:20.753 --> 39:24.689
I'm not worried about Elias.

39:24.691 --> 39:27.524
We lost a lot of good soldiers
up in that building.

39:27.526 --> 39:29.426
I'm not sure if we got
something to show for it.

39:29.428 --> 39:33.197
We can always find
more soldiers.

39:33.199 --> 39:35.031
Maybe I'm missing something.

39:35.033 --> 39:38.602
Elias didn't just have people
working for him.

39:38.604 --> 39:40.537
He had people protecting him.

39:40.539 --> 39:42.105
Detective Riley,

39:42.107 --> 39:44.674
bitch who pulled me
out of the ambulance.

39:44.676 --> 39:47.210
And whoever's bank rolling this.

39:47.212 --> 39:52.015
They're not law enforcement,
not criminals.

39:52.017 --> 39:53.965
They're something else.

39:56.354 --> 39:58.821
Need to figure it out.

39:58.823 --> 40:01.056
But it's like I told you.

40:01.058 --> 40:04.360
There's always a game
within the game.

40:04.362 --> 40:06.028
Mm.

40:15.538 --> 40:17.740
I heard about Anthony.

40:22.646 --> 40:26.481
I saved this.

40:26.483 --> 40:27.916
We look so young.

40:27.918 --> 40:30.223
Now that's a real brotherhood.

40:32.422 --> 40:35.557
Lucky to get out.

40:35.559 --> 40:39.327
Surprised we made it this far.

40:39.329 --> 40:42.297
Tell me, Bruce.

40:42.299 --> 40:43.398
How are the accounts?

40:43.400 --> 40:44.599
For real?

40:44.601 --> 40:48.903
Principle assets offshore,
untouchable.

40:48.905 --> 40:52.508
Sometimes I wish we were, too.

40:54.443 --> 40:57.611
You'll need to arrange
for a new office.

40:57.613 --> 40:59.936
Some place nice this time.

41:00.850 --> 41:04.351
And we won't meet
like this again.

41:04.353 --> 41:05.452
I've lost one friend.

41:05.454 --> 41:07.319
I don't want to lose another.

41:10.526 --> 41:13.460
Speaking of friends, we need
to catch up with some old ones.

41:13.462 --> 41:15.196
I made a list.

41:15.198 --> 41:16.797
Everybody that flipped.

41:16.799 --> 41:18.599
Good.

41:18.601 --> 41:20.067
Let's start with Gino.

41:38.118 --> 41:39.419
Yes?

41:39.421 --> 41:41.421
<i>Hello, Harold.</i>

41:41.423 --> 41:44.290
I didn't get a chance to thank
you and John for saving me.

41:44.292 --> 41:46.226
You're welcome.

41:46.228 --> 41:48.928
I hope you understand why I
didn't tell you about the bomb.

41:48.930 --> 41:51.497
You were playing
the rope-a-dope on Dominic.

41:51.499 --> 41:52.765
You drew him in.

41:52.767 --> 41:54.566
That building was a failsafe.

41:54.568 --> 41:59.004
In the inevitable event one of
my enemies would move on me.

41:59.006 --> 42:02.341
I looked into it's history.
It used to be a group home.

42:02.343 --> 42:04.143
The Wayland Home for boys.

42:04.145 --> 42:05.778
Maybe you've heard of it.

42:05.780 --> 42:09.514
I always hated that place.

42:09.516 --> 42:13.118
<i>And that room you didn't like.</i>

42:13.120 --> 42:15.754
Where bad behavior was
corrected.

42:15.756 --> 42:18.423
I'm sorry
we couldn't save Anthony.

42:22.629 --> 42:25.697
Anthony died protecting me.

42:25.699 --> 42:29.200
It's up to me now to make sure
his sacrifice wasn't in vain.

42:29.202 --> 42:30.935
<i>What will you do?</i>

42:30.937 --> 42:33.104
You told me you wouldn't
help me fight a war, John.

42:33.106 --> 42:36.674
<i>Well, sometimes a war</i>
<i>comes to you.</i>

42:36.676 --> 42:39.844
When it does, you can either
fight or be vanquished.

42:39.846 --> 42:42.781
I'm gonna see that Dominic
answers for Anthony.

42:42.783 --> 42:46.780
And when that day comes, you and Harold
would be wise to stay out of my way.

43:01.766 --> 43:04.234
<i>Invictus maneo.</i>
