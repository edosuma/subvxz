Tonight's episode
is all about golf,

00:30.655 --> 00:33.575
and I couldn't be more hype.
I mean, I love golf.

00:33.658 --> 00:34.868
Anybody here
love them some golf?

00:34.951 --> 00:35.368
Make some noise?

00:35.452 --> 00:37.746
Hey!

00:37.829 --> 00:39.622
I heard about six people.
Okay.

00:39.706 --> 00:41.624
That's more than I expected.
Now, listen,

00:41.708 --> 00:43.793
this episode should
be called:

00:43.877 --> 00:46.629
"The Real Life Legend
of Swagger Vance."

00:46.713 --> 00:49.007
[laughter]

00:49.090 --> 00:51.718
Or, if I'm being honest,

00:51.801 --> 00:55.096
"Trappy Gilmore."

00:55.180 --> 00:57.766
I mean, this show is about
to get adjacent as hell

00:57.849 --> 00:59.684
because nothing explains
why I am hood adjacent

00:59.768 --> 01:02.187
like my love for golf.

01:02.270 --> 01:04.647
Bouncing between country clubs
and South Central

01:04.730 --> 01:06.191
is one of the main reasons

01:06.274 --> 01:08.818
I have this interesting
perspective I have today.

01:08.902 --> 01:10.236
Did I try other sports
growing up?

01:10.320 --> 01:11.571
Of course.
Absolutely.

01:11.654 --> 01:16.326
I played basketball for nearly
two middle school tryouts

01:16.409 --> 01:20.079
[laughs] before I ran away from
the game like a little bitch.

01:20.163 --> 01:24.042
But after that tragedy,
the golf course became a refuge,

01:24.125 --> 01:25.460
my secret tree house.

01:25.543 --> 01:30.340
I cried and Crip Walked
on fairways across Los Angeles.

01:30.423 --> 01:31.800
When I was growing up

01:31.883 --> 01:34.344
and people would see me on the
first hole of a golf course,

01:34.427 --> 01:35.428
they would always have
the same reaction:

01:35.512 --> 01:38.640
"Ah, what is this
a Make-a-Wish situation?"

01:38.723 --> 01:40.391
But then they would see
my swing...

01:40.475 --> 01:42.936
and then they would give me
this look--it's priceless.

01:43.019 --> 01:44.562
It's like we were
back in slavery times.

01:44.646 --> 01:48.107
They're like, "You can read?
Who taught you?

01:48.191 --> 01:50.276
[applause]

01:50.360 --> 01:51.861
I passed up
a full golf scholarship

01:51.945 --> 01:53.738
at Hampton University

01:53.822 --> 01:56.407
to go to a white-ass school
called Pomona College.

01:56.491 --> 01:57.951
Now, I'm sure you're wondering

01:58.034 --> 01:59.869
why'd I turn down
a full golf scholarship.

01:59.953 --> 02:01.037
It's because
when you're a golfer

02:01.120 --> 02:03.206
at a historically black
college,

02:03.289 --> 02:04.874
that's like sending a memo out
to the rest of the campus

02:04.958 --> 02:08.461
that you're really bad at sex.

02:08.544 --> 02:10.045
So tonight we have
a whole episode about golf.

02:10.128 --> 02:12.882
This is the only episode
of the show

02:12.966 --> 02:15.718
that your dad wants to
watch more than you.

02:15.802 --> 02:17.387
And if your dad walked
out of your life,

02:17.470 --> 02:19.806
just know he's watching it
with his new family.

02:19.889 --> 02:20.557
[laughter]

02:20.640 --> 02:22.725

02:22.809 --> 02:24.310

02:24.394 --> 02:27.438

02:27.522 --> 02:30.108
And leaving your past behind.

02:30.191 --> 02:32.735
Now, everybody considers golf
a white sport,

02:32.819 --> 02:35.488
but black people
are playing golf.

02:35.572 --> 02:37.240
J.R. Smith,

02:37.323 --> 02:40.076

02:47.667 --> 02:49.294
We are out here!

02:49.377 --> 02:52.589
In fact, there's even
golf in the hood, y'all.

02:52.672 --> 02:54.424
South Central has its
own golf course,

02:54.507 --> 02:58.094
where I play in a regular
tournament called Golf Beef.

02:58.177 --> 02:59.846
I play it because every year

02:59.929 --> 03:01.306
it's like the hood version
of The Masters.

03:01.389 --> 03:03.016
Except you don't get
a green jacket.

03:03.099 --> 03:04.559
There's just green

07:00.253 --> 07:02.964
there was one thing

07:03.047 --> 07:04.924
It's because of Tiger
that I played golf

07:05.007 --> 07:06.676
and was exposed to

all these different
types of personalities,

from old-school Black Panthers
to old white dudes

These days, golf isn't
as poppin' as it used to be,

Yo, yo, what's g--
What is going on in my club?

16:27.319 --> 16:28.779
What is this?

16:28.862 --> 16:30.531
You do one episode about golf,

16:30.614 --> 16:32.324
I done made the whites
so comfortable,

16:32.408 --> 16:35.994
they put a coffee shop
in my shit.

gentrified just like the hood!

What is--what is this?

16:46.797 --> 16:48.716
{\an8}I can't deal right now.
Norm just got

16:48.799 --> 16:51.593
{\an8}priced out of his DJ booth
by some deadmau5 wannabe.

16:51.677 --> 16:52.886
{\an8}Gentrification is so real.

{\an8}Uh, DJ whoever the [BLEEP]
you are,

16:54.888 --> 16:56.014

17:07.526 --> 17:12.614
{\an8}- Do you guys have any
feelings on the sport of golf?

17:12.698 --> 17:16.577
- I think Tiger Woods
shoulda got to keep his hos.

17:16.660 --> 17:17.994
{\an1}- Has he won
a Masters in a long time?

17:18.078 --> 17:21.080
{\an1}It's been a while.
He hasn't won since--

17:21.165 --> 17:23.709
- It's been over ten years.
- And his father passed away,

17:23.791 --> 17:25.335
right?
- When?

17:25.419 --> 17:25.961
{\an1}- Like right around
the cheating.

17:26.044 --> 17:28.047
- So his dad died,

17:28.130 --> 17:29.631
and she still
ain't give him a pass?

17:29.715 --> 17:31.175
{\an1}- You think
he deserved a pass?

17:31.258 --> 17:32.926
- If yo daddy died?

17:33.010 --> 17:36.138
- How many of the women
should be discounted

17:36.221 --> 17:37.848
due to his father
passing away?

17:37.931 --> 17:39.725
- However long it hurt.

17:39.808 --> 17:41.477
- What about the women
he slept with

17:41.560 --> 17:43.854
before his dad died?
- Right. That's all part of--

17:43.937 --> 17:45.731
He felt it coming.

17:45.814 --> 17:47.232
Literally.

17:47.316 --> 17:49.443
- I'm on a mission, guys,

17:49.526 --> 17:50.944
and it's to make golf
cool again.

17:51.028 --> 17:53.071
- That's not fun.
For no kid.

17:53.155 --> 17:55.532
No kid's like, "Daddy,
get me a golf course!"

17:55.616 --> 17:58.243
{\an1}- But he wanted to.
He's an example of somebody

17:58.327 --> 18:00.788
{\an1}who like had access to golf
and clearly took lessons.

18:00.871 --> 18:03.165
- Nah. Some chick
made him wanna play.

18:03.248 --> 18:04.500
- Yeah, it was my mom.

18:04.583 --> 18:06.752
- Same.

18:06.835 --> 18:08.337
[light laughter]

18:08.420 --> 18:10.047
- Why don't
more black people play golf?

18:10.130 --> 18:12.800
- 'Cause it's boring.
- Yeah, it's slow.

18:12.883 --> 18:14.009
- 'Cause you can't pass
the golf ball to another dude,

18:14.092 --> 18:16.929
like, "Dunk this
in that hole."

18:17.012 --> 18:18.722
You think white people
brought us over here as slaves

18:18.806 --> 18:22.518
to play golf? They brought us
here for basketball.

Recently, we retired
the Crying Jordan Meme.

I've been peepin'
a lot of y'all

18:35.114 --> 18:37.991
using Tiger's D.U.I. mug shot

18:38.075 --> 18:38.742
as the new face of the L.

18:38.826 --> 18:42.412
Not okay.
Not okay.

18:42.496 --> 18:45.249
Stop smilin', not acceptable.

18:45.332 --> 18:47.376
Put the picture up.

18:47.459 --> 18:48.627
[laughter]

18:48.710 --> 18:50.420
I mean, sure, Tiger looks
like the Samoan lunch lady

18:50.504 --> 18:53.882
who just got fired mid-shift,
but that ain't that funny.

18:53.966 --> 18:57.386
That's just pure observation.

18:57.469 --> 18:59.221
Okay, one more,
one more, one more.

18:59.304 --> 19:00.806
And so what if he looks like

19:00.889 --> 19:02.558
he just got dropped off
at my house

19:02.641 --> 19:04.184
with a bucket of cleaning
supplies

19:04.268 --> 19:05.936
and a little kid
named Eduardo.

19:06.019 --> 19:07.646
So what?

19:07.729 --> 19:09.106
Tiger can overcome this.

19:09.189 --> 19:12.401
He's great
at overcoming adversity.

19:12.484 --> 19:14.361
He already
overcame his first demon--

19:14.444 --> 19:18.240
that awful-ass first name
of his: "Eldrick."

19:18.323 --> 19:19.575
That's an awful name.
Eldrick?

19:19.658 --> 19:23.328
That sound like the [BLEEP]
who invented barbecue.

19:23.412 --> 19:24.371
"Oooh, what's on these links?

19:24.454 --> 19:29.209
Ha, ha, ha,
that's that Eldrick."

19:29.293 --> 19:31.420
Let's not remember Tiger
as a punch line.

19:31.503 --> 19:33.213
Let's remember Tiger as
the guy who won 14 Majors,

19:33.297 --> 19:37.426
[applause, whooping]
dominated a sport...

19:37.509 --> 19:40.929
that was known
only for white people,

19:41.013 --> 19:44.725
and became the first person to
ever have their golf video game.

maybe photoshop
a fist pumping arm
