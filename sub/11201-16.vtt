00:01.501 --> 00:03.833
<i>NARRA TOR: Previously on</i> Stargate SG-1.

00:03.937 --> 00:08.237
- What exactly do you want from me?
- The code to an Ancient tablet.

00:08.341 --> 00:11.367
- Do I know you?
- You did a long time ago.

00:12.078 --> 00:14.376
Athena, Greek goddess of war.

00:14.481 --> 00:15.880
Qetesh double-crossed her

00:15.982 --> 00:19.042
when they partnered up to search
for the Clava Thessara Infinitas.

00:19.152 --> 00:21.552
Now, according to legend,
it would allow he who possesses it entry

00:21.654 --> 00:25.613
to a vast storehouse of riches hidden away
by the Ancients prior to their Ascension.

00:27.761 --> 00:30.389
The Clava Thessara Infinitas,
"The key to infinite treasure,"

00:30.497 --> 00:32.397
a cache of Ancient wealth and weapons.

00:32.499 --> 00:36.196
You do realize the last cache
of Ancient stuff we picked up

00:36.302 --> 00:38.167
is what got us in trouble
with the Ori in the first place.

00:38.271 --> 00:40.865
So, what, just leave it out there
for someone else to find?

00:40.974 --> 00:44.501
I thought you believed the Clava Thessara
Infinitas to be a hoax, Daniel Jackson.

00:44.611 --> 00:47.375
I did, yes, but the research Athena did
is actually quite compelling.

00:47.480 --> 00:49.971
Now, after cross-referencing her research
and our cartouche,

00:50.083 --> 00:51.550
I was able to generate a gate address.

00:51.651 --> 00:53.084
Possible location of the treasure?

00:53.186 --> 00:55.950
I'm not sure,
but we sent a MALP to P4M-328,

00:56.056 --> 00:58.752
and the images it sent back
are particularly interesting.

00:58.858 --> 01:00.723
Now, the hieroglyphs on the wall
are all out of order

01:00.827 --> 01:01.816
and from various different dynasties.

01:01.928 --> 01:03.589
At first glance, they don't make any sense.

01:03.696 --> 01:05.061
It's a code.

01:06.733 --> 01:09.497
Sounds like it's worth checking out.
Go ahead.

01:09.602 --> 01:12.127
Should we not wait until Colonel Carter
returns from Washington?

01:12.238 --> 01:15.105
She's still there briefing the President
on the scenario that played out

01:15.208 --> 01:18.473
in the alternate reality,
where the stargate was made public.

01:18.578 --> 01:20.375
That's taking longer than
it was supposed to.

01:20.480 --> 01:22.914
Well, it could be a good way to examine
what might happen here.

01:23.016 --> 01:25.314
Sounds like President Hayes
is having a hard time

01:25.418 --> 01:28.683
just getting past the fact that
he wasn't President.

01:40.800 --> 01:44.759
Well, I'm going to set up my camera and
take some high-res stills of these glyphs.

01:54.013 --> 01:58.006
Give Ansel Adams there a hand.
Teal'c and I will check out the perimeter.

01:58.118 --> 01:59.210
Right.

02:00.186 --> 02:03.280
Well, I'm sure that's a very witty
popular culture reference, but...

02:03.389 --> 02:05.721
He's a photographer best known
for his black-and-white images

02:05.825 --> 02:08.259
of California's Yosemite Valley.

02:08.361 --> 02:11.558
(LAUGHS) Oh. Good one.

02:15.802 --> 02:20.102
Is it me or did we just step into
an architectural time machine?

02:20.206 --> 02:21.173
Indeed.

02:23.877 --> 02:26.038
This is a display case.

02:29.983 --> 02:31.280
Hey, can you read that?

02:36.756 --> 02:39.054
I do not recognize the language.

02:40.460 --> 02:43.520
Well, we ain't in a pyramid.

02:44.597 --> 02:46.121
We're in a museum.

02:50.970 --> 02:52.938
- Colonel Mitchell.
- Yeah.

02:54.007 --> 02:56.498
- Do you hear music?
- No.

02:57.577 --> 02:58.635
Yes.

03:00.446 --> 03:02.038
<i>(MUSIC PLA YING)</i>

03:02.182 --> 03:03.706
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

03:20.033 --> 03:22.024
- Pack it up.
- What?

03:22.135 --> 03:24.831
- I'm pulling the plug.
- But we haven't even got started yet.

03:24.938 --> 03:27.873
- This is not a tomb.
- It's a museum.

03:27.974 --> 03:29.874
Well, that would explain
why the hieroglyphs are all jumbled.

03:29.976 --> 03:32.410
And there's a pretty big party going on
next door, so...

03:32.512 --> 03:34.537
- Right.
- What kind of party?

03:34.647 --> 03:37.445
The kind we do not invite ourselves to.

03:37.550 --> 03:39.211
This is a first contact situation.

03:39.319 --> 03:41.480
When a civilization reaches
a certain level of development,

03:41.588 --> 03:43.180
we don't do those in person.

03:43.289 --> 03:44.688
We send the MALP to make contact.

03:44.791 --> 03:47.624
And if they are into the idea
of extraterrestrial visitors,

03:47.727 --> 03:50.696
then we get to go to the party, not before.
Basic protocol. Cut that out.

03:50.797 --> 03:52.196
What's the harm? We're already here.

03:52.298 --> 03:54.562
We could go
and just not tell them we're alien.

03:54.667 --> 03:57.192
- It's not going to happen.
- That wasn't a good one.

03:57.303 --> 03:58.600
Clear out.

04:24.364 --> 04:26.355
Okay, that's not good.

05:33.766 --> 05:34.994
If they found a gate,

05:35.101 --> 05:37.092
they most likely found a DHD, no?

05:37.203 --> 05:38.363
We didn't.

05:38.471 --> 05:40.462
Well, they knew enough to build
a pretty convincing replica,

05:40.573 --> 05:42.632
so they must have one lying around here
somewhere, no?

05:42.742 --> 05:45.438
No, they could have just fabricated it
from drawings.

05:45.545 --> 05:47.604
If indeed they did possess
an authentic DHD,

05:47.714 --> 05:49.944
would they not display it
near the authentic gate?

05:50.049 --> 05:51.812
Good point, good point.

05:51.918 --> 05:53.715
- We're stuck.
- No, we're not.

05:54.854 --> 05:58.722
Well, when we fail to make the scheduled
check-in, General Landry will dial in,

05:58.825 --> 06:00.986
at which point we'll ask him
to send a naquadah generator

06:01.094 --> 06:03.892
and a laptop with the dialing program,
and that's that.

06:04.564 --> 06:05.553
We knew that.

06:05.665 --> 06:07.292
I thought that when I said that we're stuck

06:07.400 --> 06:09.368
that you would know that
I meant until then.

06:09.469 --> 06:10.902
Well, then you should say what you mean.

06:11.003 --> 06:12.231
I don't think you want me
to start doing that.

06:12.338 --> 06:15.671
I don't think you want to start thinking
what I think.

06:15.775 --> 06:18.300
Anyhow, F.Y.I.,
we don't need the dialing computer.

06:18.411 --> 06:20.743
Worst-case scenario,
we can always dial the gate manually.

06:20.847 --> 06:24.715
Right, kick it rotary style.
Still need a power source.

06:24.817 --> 06:26.717
- What about the MALP?
- No.

06:26.819 --> 06:28.081
- Say we...
- Don't go there.

06:28.221 --> 06:29.586
Well, let's hope it doesn't come to that.

06:29.689 --> 06:34.956
So, therefore, next check-in
is in just under six hours.

06:35.061 --> 06:37.928
Good. Muscles, that means
we have time to go to the party.

06:38.030 --> 06:39.054
No, it does not.

06:39.165 --> 06:44.125
It means we stay here out of sight,
and remain as inconspicuous as possible.

06:44.237 --> 06:49.038
With a bit of luck, the people on this
planet will never even know we were here.

09:22.161 --> 09:25.961
and on the ground until we figure this out.

09:26.933 --> 09:29.401
What the hell happened?

09:29.502 --> 09:30.969
We had a little misunderstanding.

09:31.070 --> 09:32.332
Yeah, I can see that.

09:32.438 --> 09:34.565
Might have been easier
to just pose as party guests.

09:34.674 --> 09:37.609
- They thought we were rebels.
- What does that mean?

09:37.710 --> 09:40.440
I don't know! I didn't get a chance
to ask a lot of questions.

09:40.546 --> 09:42.537
Why are all the outer doors sealed off?

09:43.449 --> 09:47.351
One of their guys shot that case.
It must have triggered a lockdown.

09:47.453 --> 09:49.546
And for the moment,
it would be good if it stayed that way.

09:49.655 --> 09:50.644
Wonderful.

09:50.756 --> 09:52.849
- See what you can do.
- Okay.

09:54.193 --> 09:56.957
Excuse me? Don't shoot.

09:57.063 --> 09:58.655
Then don't stand.

09:59.832 --> 10:02.767
Please, let all these other people go.

but you're not.

10:07.707 --> 10:11.837
Well, the Viceroy and all
the other Chancellors were able to escape.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.170
I'm all that's left.

10:15.247 --> 10:17.807
- Keep me, free the others.
- Listen...

10:17.917 --> 10:22.411
Look, I know you believe that bringing us
to our knees will make you heroes,

10:22.521 --> 10:25.854
that the people will follow your lead
and rise up against us,

10:25.958 --> 10:29.860
but harming innocent civilians
will get you nowhere.

10:31.931 --> 10:36.265
I know you're going to find this hard
to believe, but we're not rebels.

10:36.769 --> 10:39.431
- We're explorers.
- What?

10:39.538 --> 10:41.972
You see, we're from another planet.

10:42.074 --> 10:43.905
Actually, a whole other star system,
really.

10:44.010 --> 10:46.979
(STAMMERING) Wait. Another planet?

10:47.079 --> 10:49.070
You see, you have a large ring back there
in an exhibit.

It's called a stargate
and it's an interplanetary transporter.

It's a terrible idea.

Why?

11:45.071 --> 11:46.834
Well, it doesn't matter
what we say to them.

11:46.939 --> 11:49.703
They think we're rebels.
We shot a security guard.

11:49.809 --> 11:50.833
We took hostages.

11:51.677 --> 11:55.113

with people.

11:58.851 --> 12:01.115
Not intentionally, no,

12:01.220 --> 12:05.782
but all we've got to do is stall
for five and a half hours till Landry dials in.

12:05.891 --> 12:08.382
Then we bolt, and those people can
believe what they want to believe.

12:08.494 --> 12:09.586

12:17.002 --> 12:19.527
This is an alien culture
of which we have no knowledge.

12:19.638 --> 12:21.629
We don't know how they're going
to handle a situation like this.

12:21.741 --> 12:24.369
We don't know
if they're going to wait six hours.

Once we start posing as kidnappers,
there's no turning back,

and if we get captured, we are hooped!

but I don't think we have a choice.

12:34.153 --> 12:37.452

are not going to be open to the idea

14:46.418 --> 14:48.886
We have you completely surrounded.

14:54.293 --> 14:55.817
Hey, Mitchell.

14:58.197 --> 14:59.562
Jackson.

15:00.132 --> 15:03.192
- You okay?
- VALA: They zapped you.

15:03.903 --> 15:07.134
Oh, I got that, thank you. What did I miss?

15:07.740 --> 15:11.403
Well, the real negotiator got here
and wants to know what our demands are.

15:11.510 --> 15:12.943
Any ideas?

15:13.045 --> 15:16.208
- A jet to Algeria?
- How about a real DHD?

15:16.315 --> 15:17.543
No, we need these demands
to make sense.

15:17.650 --> 15:19.880
I mean, something these rebels
would actually say.

15:19.985 --> 15:21.282
Excuse me?

15:22.521 --> 15:25.183
- Did you really come through the ring?
- Yes, we did.

15:25.291 --> 15:27.088
It's a portal, isn't it, to other worlds?

15:27.192 --> 15:29.160
Yeah, I'd be happy to show you
how it works,

15:29.261 --> 15:31.024
once we get it up and running again.

15:31.130 --> 15:33.598
You want them to free your friends.

15:34.300 --> 15:36.063
- I'm sorry, what?
- Your demands.

15:36.168 --> 15:39.899
If you want to pose as the rebels, the first
thing they usually do in situations like this

15:40.005 --> 15:42.473
is ask for the freeing
of their imprisoned compatriots.

15:42.574 --> 15:45.099
- WOMAN: Don't talk to them.
- No, it's okay.

15:46.779 --> 15:48.974
- What's your name?
- Cicero.

15:49.081 --> 15:51.914
I'm a researcher here at the museum,
and I believe you.

15:52.017 --> 15:54.451
You want to get on the radio
and explain that to the folks outside?

15:54.553 --> 15:56.680
Oh, I've tried.
I've suspected as much for years.

15:56.789 --> 16:00.156
I've published dozens of papers,
written a book. No one listens.

16:00.259 --> 16:02.124
My colleagues think I'm a bit of a joke.

16:02.227 --> 16:04.491
Oh, Daniel, you've found a kindred spirit.

16:04.596 --> 16:08.032
On most planets, found along with the ring
is what we call a DHD.

16:08.133 --> 16:12.069
It's a dialing device, similar to the one
you have back in the exhibit.

16:12.171 --> 16:13.399
Do you have the real one here?

16:13.505 --> 16:15.632
We've found fragments of it,
but the one in the pyramid room

16:15.741 --> 16:18.107
is a reconstruction
from some diagrams we found.

16:18.210 --> 16:20.201
Yeah, we know. That's why we're stuck.

16:20.312 --> 16:23.304
Well, if one of the fragments
is the power source...

16:25.250 --> 16:26.410
Cicero?

16:28.087 --> 16:29.315
Stand up.

16:32.057 --> 16:35.356
I need you to take us to your lab.

16:35.461 --> 16:36.450
Of course.

16:36.562 --> 16:39.087
Wait a second. I'm going to need
a primer on these rebels first.

16:40.199 --> 16:42.861
<i>JACKSON: And after they're freed,</i>
<i>we'd like the Viceroy to call a referendum</i>

16:42.968 --> 16:47.268
<i>on dissolving his government, and finally,</i>
<i>we want to make a public statement</i>

16:47.373 --> 16:51.776
on the Gainord transmitters,
to address the people of this proud nation.

16:52.344 --> 16:54.107
That's unacceptable.

16:54.947 --> 16:56.073
<i>Excuse me?</i>

16:56.181 --> 16:59.981
Believe me, I want this
to end well for both of us,

17:00.085 --> 17:04.818
but as you should know from previous
attempts at political terrorism like this,

17:05.758 --> 17:11.321
the Viceroy would rather sacrifice the
hostages before bowing to such demands.

17:11.430 --> 17:14.922
Remember to thank Cicero
for his wonderful intel.

17:15.034 --> 17:16.592
What about freeing the imprisoned rebels?

17:18.904 --> 17:20.428
That'll take time.

17:20.539 --> 17:22.666
<i>Oh, absolutely.</i>

17:22.775 --> 17:25.710
<i>We recognize that, sir.</i>
<i>You take all the time you need.</i>

17:25.811 --> 17:26.800
<i>(LAUGHS) Yeah.</i>

17:26.912 --> 17:29.904
<i>You run that through the proper channels,</i>
<i>you talk to whoever you need to talk to.</i>

17:30.015 --> 17:31.039
<i>We're in no rush.</i>

17:31.150 --> 17:33.584
I'm sure the hostages would disagree
with that.

17:33.685 --> 17:35.880
They're fine. We're not going to hurt them.

17:37.990 --> 17:42.791
Unless you get cute, in which case
there's gonna be killing and whatnot.

17:43.896 --> 17:45.193
All right.

17:46.098 --> 17:47.895
I'll see what I can do.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.365
Sir?

17:49.468 --> 17:53.302
We have a man on an auxiliary channel
who claims to be inside the museum.

17:53.405 --> 17:55.498
Says he's a security guard.

17:57.943 --> 17:58.910
Who am I talking to?

18:00.512 --> 18:02.139
Jayem Saran, sir.

18:03.482 --> 18:05.882
Night guard, second-class.

18:05.984 --> 18:08.248
<i>QUARTUS: And you're inside</i>
<i>the museum right now?</i>

18:08.353 --> 18:09.615
Yes, sir.

18:10.622 --> 18:12.385
How did you escape the initial attack?

18:14.426 --> 18:16.360
I wasn't there, sir.

18:17.062 --> 18:18.859
I was doing my rounds.

18:18.964 --> 18:21.592
By the time I got on the scene,
the fight was over.

18:21.700 --> 18:23.099
There was nothing I could do, sir.

18:23.202 --> 18:25.170
No need to apologize.

18:25.270 --> 18:26.965
Engaging them
would have been a mistake.

18:27.739 --> 18:31.266
I always wanted to serve
on the Council's Guard, sir,

18:31.376 --> 18:35.176
but some mistakes I made
when I was a kid messed up my record.

18:35.914 --> 18:37.882
- Listen...
<i>- I've been a guard at this museum</i>

18:37.983 --> 18:39.177
<i>for 10 years now.</i>

18:39.284 --> 18:40.911
<i>I know it like the back of my hand.</i>

18:41.019 --> 18:44.079
We have a complete set of schematics
out here. Not to worry.

18:44.690 --> 18:49.627
Yeah, well, I'm sure you do,
but I am on the inside.

18:50.996 --> 18:53.692
I can be your ears, your eyes.

18:54.366 --> 18:55.993
You know what would be the most help?

18:56.635 --> 18:59.900
Standing by for your orders, sir.

19:00.005 --> 19:02.530
<i>Find a safe place, stay there,</i>

19:02.641 --> 19:05.633
<i>- and wait until this whole thing is over.</i>
- What are you going to do?

19:06.345 --> 19:10.406
That's not your concern, Guardsman.
Our plan just doesn't involve you.

19:10.983 --> 19:15.147
<i>- Don't get in the way.</i>
- Very well. Jayem out.

19:27.232 --> 19:29.496
Our radios must be compromised.

19:31.136 --> 19:33.468
He doesn't want me to stand down.

19:34.306 --> 19:38.743
He just needs it to look
like I'm standing down.

19:45.350 --> 19:47.511
The Viceroy's attempt to separate
the governing council

19:47.619 --> 19:49.644
from the Circle of Heavens
is controversial,

19:49.755 --> 19:51.723
but the majority of the people
are on his side.

19:51.823 --> 19:53.085
Hang... Hang on.

19:53.192 --> 19:55.626
They think we're some kind
of radical religious sect?

19:55.727 --> 19:58.025
That's right.
The rebels are growing stronger every day.

19:58.130 --> 20:00.894
Unfortunately, you couldn't have picked
a worse time to be mistaken for them.

20:00.999 --> 20:01.988
How's that?

20:02.100 --> 20:04.398
They've had a string of successes
against the Council and its members.

20:04.503 --> 20:05.904
The Viceroy needs a win
to show his might.

20:05.904 --> 20:06.893
The Viceroy needs a win
to show his might.

20:07.005 --> 20:10.372
If this is handled badly, it could turn
into a bloody mess very quickly.

20:10.475 --> 20:13.842
Keep that positive thinking going, Cicero.
Anything?

20:13.946 --> 20:14.935
No.

20:15.047 --> 20:17.311
My co-worker has an archive
on the other side of the building.

20:17.416 --> 20:20.544
It's possible other pieces
we found are stored there.

20:20.652 --> 20:22.119
Lead the way.

20:31.830 --> 20:34.628
What were you and Heren doing
in the hallway?

20:34.733 --> 20:36.894
- What?
- In the hallway.

20:37.002 --> 20:39.835
Before you came out screaming,
what were you doing?

20:39.938 --> 20:41.838
Looking at some of the other exhibits.

20:41.940 --> 20:43.908
But the museum is closed.

20:44.009 --> 20:47.206
We were told everything outside
the lobby is off-limits.

20:47.312 --> 20:49.678
- We were?
- Did she kiss you?

20:49.781 --> 20:53.012
- Me? No...
- You did, didn't you?

20:53.118 --> 20:54.210
You hardly spoke to him all night.

20:54.319 --> 20:55.752
I didn't think you were
interested anymore.

20:55.854 --> 20:57.685
Why do you always do this?

20:57.789 --> 20:59.848
Why must you always try
to take everything that is mine

20:59.958 --> 21:01.118
and try to make it your own?

21:01.226 --> 21:02.215
He was hardly yours.

21:02.327 --> 21:03.726
I hate you!

21:03.996 --> 21:05.327
(BOTH SCREAMING)

21:05.430 --> 21:09.366
What the hell are you doing? Stop it!

21:10.802 --> 21:11.769
She started it.

21:11.870 --> 21:14.031
I think you started it
when you kissed Heren...

21:14.139 --> 21:16.664
Shut up! Shut up!

21:17.576 --> 21:19.305
You're hostages.

21:19.411 --> 21:22.744
This is, like,
a life-and-death situation here.

21:22.848 --> 21:24.406
Start acting like it.

21:24.516 --> 21:26.780
Oh, please, you're no rebels.

21:26.885 --> 21:29.319
We're not deaf, you know.
Everyone in this room knows it.

21:29.421 --> 21:31.412
That doesn't matter.

21:31.523 --> 21:33.684
You're hostages! We're your...
We're your captors.

21:33.792 --> 21:35.123
We're heavily armed!

21:35.227 --> 21:39.163
There's rules.
There's a whole school of etiquette to this.

21:42.034 --> 21:43.331
Don't eyeball me.

21:44.369 --> 21:48.032
An artificial stable wormhole. Fascinating.

21:48.140 --> 21:49.471
Yeah, pretty darn nifty, huh?

21:49.574 --> 21:52.236
And the galaxy is populated,
other people on other planets?

21:52.344 --> 21:55.541
- A couple of galaxies, as a matter of fact.
- Amazing.

21:55.647 --> 21:58.946
Hey, when you guys found
the gate and the pyramid,

21:59.051 --> 22:01.645
there wasn't a stash of advanced
alien weapons, was there?

22:01.753 --> 22:05.189
- No, I'm afraid not.
- Yeah, just a shot in the dark anyway.

22:05.290 --> 22:08.623
You know, if we...
Well, will you look at that?

22:12.197 --> 22:16.133
- Is that what I think it is?
- No, it's a Goa'uld naquadah bomb.

22:16.234 --> 22:18.532
For the record,
that's what I thought it was.

22:18.637 --> 22:20.764
Yes, I'm sure you did.

22:20.872 --> 22:23.705
Well, it seems in pretty good shape.

22:23.809 --> 22:26.209
If it's real,
and if the naquadah core is intact...

22:26.311 --> 22:29.610
I assume these cases are connected
to the security system?

22:29.715 --> 22:30.909
Yes.

22:31.016 --> 22:32.347
So we can't get into the case?

22:32.451 --> 22:35.045
You won't be able to access it
without a security card.

22:35.153 --> 22:38.884
- And you have one of those, no?
- Not for these exhibits, no.

22:39.658 --> 22:40.625
Well, not to worry.

22:40.726 --> 22:43.923
You happen to be standing next to
one of the best thieves in two galaxies.

22:44.029 --> 22:46.589
No, not him.

22:46.698 --> 22:50.794
So, if anyone can get this bomb out
with no security card, it is me.

22:50.902 --> 22:52.199
Watch and learn, boys.

22:52.304 --> 22:56.104
Removal of treasure from
a sealed glass enclosure.

22:56.975 --> 22:58.067
(INHALING)

22:59.511 --> 23:04.312
Step one, identify the tamper circuit
and try to bypass it.

23:05.517 --> 23:08.680
When circuit proves inaccessible,
go to step two.

23:08.787 --> 23:12.848
Cut a treasure-sized hole in the glass.

23:16.328 --> 23:18.262
You just happen to carry one
of those around with you?

23:18.363 --> 23:21.355
One must always be prepared
to liberate treasure, Cameron.

23:26.238 --> 23:30.937
Step three, examine the base of the object
for pressure switch.

23:31.042 --> 23:33.442
When found, bypass it.

23:34.846 --> 23:38.247
And finally, we reach in...

23:44.756 --> 23:45.882
(SIGHS)

23:46.224 --> 23:51.753
All right. Removal of treasure
from a sealed metal enclosure.

23:51.863 --> 23:52.830
No.

23:56.168 --> 23:59.160
MITCHELL: You rushed it.
VALA: I did not.

23:59.271 --> 24:01.330
You were showing off, and you rushed it.

24:01.440 --> 24:04.705
This is an alien security system
that I've never experienced before.

24:04.810 --> 24:07.870
And the fact that I got this far
is very impressive.

24:07.979 --> 24:09.913
- How do we get one of those cards?
- Oh...

24:10.015 --> 24:11.710
SARAN: You don't.

24:11.817 --> 24:14.843
Throw your guns on the floor. Now.

24:16.555 --> 24:17.817
(SIGHING)

24:21.827 --> 24:24.421
And the little ones on your legs.

24:30.168 --> 24:32.898
- Well, don't just stand there, Cicero.
- Huh?

24:33.004 --> 24:34.164
Pick them up.

24:34.272 --> 24:35.705
Oh! Right.

24:39.144 --> 24:41.408
Good, now come stand over here.

24:41.580 --> 24:44.845
Thanks. They tried to make me
get them a key card.

24:44.950 --> 24:46.474
Yeah, I heard.

24:47.919 --> 24:50.717
- Toss over your communicator.
- Okay. Relax.

24:51.456 --> 24:54.619
You got us. You're in control.

24:54.726 --> 24:57.490
That's right. I am.

25:06.071 --> 25:09.973
- You press the big button to talk.
- Yeah. I know how to use it.

25:13.945 --> 25:17.039
Murderous rebels, come in, please.

25:18.917 --> 25:19.884
Speaking.

25:20.819 --> 25:22.684
I have your two friends.

25:22.787 --> 25:25.950
Let the hostages go,
or I'm going to kill them.

25:29.027 --> 25:29.994
Excuse me?

25:31.463 --> 25:34.921
Your friends, I have them at gunpoint.
If you don't let the rest of the hostages go,

25:35.033 --> 25:36.330
I'm going to kill them.

25:37.502 --> 25:40.369
- Who's calling?
<i>- SARAN: Who I am is of no importance.</i>

25:40.472 --> 25:42.531
Oh, I disagree.

25:44.175 --> 25:45.437
Tell him.

25:50.682 --> 25:52.741
- Jackson?
- Mitchell, what's going on?

25:52.851 --> 25:55.081
Well, we got ourselves a bit of
a John McClane here.

25:56.488 --> 25:59.116
- What? What are you talking about?
<i>- Die Hard.</i>

25:59.224 --> 26:02.125
<i>A security guard got the drop on us</i>

26:02.861 --> 26:04.590
and I think he wants to trade.

26:06.264 --> 26:07.458
How do you want to play this?

26:10.835 --> 26:13.929
Well, the two of us for all those hostages,
doesn't seem quite fair now, does it?

26:14.039 --> 26:15.973
Now, that's enough. Slide it over.

26:17.842 --> 26:21.437
<i>SARAN: Okay, there.</i>
<i>You've got proof that I've got them.</i>

26:21.546 --> 26:23.480
<i>Now let the hostages go.</i>

26:24.549 --> 26:25.516
No.

26:27.752 --> 26:30.585
You heard me, right? I'm...
I'm going to kill them.

26:30.855 --> 26:35.485
Yeah, but if we let the hostages go,
we're all dead, so, no.

26:36.094 --> 26:37.220
But...

26:39.598 --> 26:40.758
Oh, I see.

26:45.670 --> 26:47.035
What is it?

26:49.040 --> 26:50.632
They must know where we are.

26:50.742 --> 26:53.575
They've probably sent someone
to come rescue them already.

26:54.279 --> 26:57.180
They're quick. I'll give them that.

26:57.282 --> 26:58.874
- Really?
- Yeah.

26:58.984 --> 27:01.885
I've just got to stay one step
ahead of them.

27:03.288 --> 27:06.348
- You any good with a gun?
- I've never fired one.

27:06.891 --> 27:11.658
No. No, of course not. Uh, okay. Okay...

27:17.235 --> 27:19.533
Yes. Okay.

27:19.638 --> 27:21.629
I'm going to go get into position
down the hall,

27:21.740 --> 27:24.140
and when their friends come
looking for us,

27:24.242 --> 27:27.507
I'll "get the drop on them," as they say.

27:27.612 --> 27:29.375
CICERO: Seems like the smart thing to do.

27:29.481 --> 27:30.573
Yeah.

27:31.249 --> 27:34.650
All right, if those two try anything,
shoot them.

27:34.753 --> 27:36.550
Of course, yeah.

27:51.936 --> 27:55.099
- Sorry about that.
- That's all right.

27:55.206 --> 27:57.140
Happens all the time.

27:57.242 --> 27:59.836
He's a night security guard.
Has been since I started working here.

27:59.944 --> 28:01.707
- He would never have killed you.
- Yeah, we got that.

28:01.813 --> 28:02.939
He means well.

28:03.048 --> 28:06.745
Yeah, I'm sure he does, but we can't have
him running around out there.

28:06.851 --> 28:08.113
We'll be right back.

28:08.219 --> 28:09.345
Can I do anything?

28:09.454 --> 28:13.515
No, we got it covered. Just stay here.

28:24.469 --> 28:25.561
Halt.

28:27.672 --> 28:29.663
Disarm, rebel dogs.

28:36.381 --> 28:40.545
He left himself wide open from behind.
That was a mistake.

28:44.989 --> 28:46.923
One of the hostages is a nurse.

28:47.025 --> 28:49.220
She was able to stabilize
the wounded guard.

28:49.327 --> 28:51.192
Oh, finally, some good news.

28:53.998 --> 28:58.799
It is my belief these men
in fact are not rebels,

28:58.903 --> 29:00.894
but common thieves.

29:01.005 --> 29:03.269
Now, if we rise up against them and...

29:04.042 --> 29:05.134
(SCREAMS)

29:11.750 --> 29:13.650
Please remain calm,

29:13.752 --> 29:18.712
as we attempt to rectify
this most unfortunate circumstance.

29:23.661 --> 29:25.993
What have you done with Cicero?

29:26.598 --> 29:29.260
- You killed him, didn't you?
- No, he...

29:30.401 --> 29:33.165
- Actually, where is Cicero?
- I don't know.

29:34.139 --> 29:37.370
- What did you do with his body?
- He's fine.

29:37.475 --> 29:39.136
He probably just went to the bathroom
or something.

29:39.244 --> 29:43.442
Try selling your lies to someone else,
filthy rebel scum.

29:43.548 --> 29:48.110
Okay. This display case,
we need to get into it.

29:49.854 --> 29:52.186
You're security. Where's your access card?

29:53.424 --> 29:56.723
It's safe.
Hidden away in a place you'll never find.

30:00.632 --> 30:03.226
No, no, no... No!

30:11.976 --> 30:13.136
(BEEPING)

30:17.215 --> 30:19.410
Enter your access code, please.

30:19.517 --> 30:21.985
That is a rare, priceless artifact,

30:22.086 --> 30:24.213
and if you think I'm just going
to stand here and let you steal it,

30:24.322 --> 30:25.789
you're out of your minds.

30:25.890 --> 30:28.552
Do whatever you want to me.
I'll never tell.

30:28.660 --> 30:32.027
It is not a rare and priceless artifact.

30:33.198 --> 30:34.995
It's a bomb.

30:35.099 --> 30:38.500
Now, we don't want to hurt anyone,
but we need its power source to get home,

30:38.603 --> 30:42.198
and the sooner we do that,
the sooner everyone can leave.

30:42.307 --> 30:46.004
- So, what do you say?
- You'll have to kill me first.

30:49.214 --> 30:50.272
(SIGHING)

30:53.384 --> 30:56.820
- What are you doing?
- I'm activating it.

30:57.622 --> 31:00.284
(STAMMERING) Why?
Why would you do that?

31:00.391 --> 31:05.158
Well, if we can't have this device,
we have no reason to live.

31:05.263 --> 31:09.427
Agreed. So, what, you think
it'll take down the whole building?

31:09.534 --> 31:11.195
Well, absolutely.

31:11.302 --> 31:15.102
I mean, anyone within a few miles
will probably be incinerated.

31:15.206 --> 31:16.605
Maybe more.

31:16.708 --> 31:19.472
And all because he wouldn't give us
the code. Shame.

31:19.577 --> 31:22.671
- You're crazy.
- You ever meet a sane rebel?

31:22.780 --> 31:24.543
You make a good point.

31:24.649 --> 31:27.083
Make your peace with your maker.

31:33.658 --> 31:36.149
Okay, okay. I'll do it.

31:42.934 --> 31:44.925
You made the right choice.

31:52.110 --> 31:53.543
That's interesting.

31:54.879 --> 31:56.005
What?

31:56.748 --> 31:59.046
Well, I'm not sure I can turn this off.

31:59.150 --> 32:02.677
- You actually turned it on?
- Yes.

32:02.787 --> 32:05.381
Why would you do that?

32:05.490 --> 32:06.582
Well, a number of reasons.

32:06.691 --> 32:10.627
Firstly, to see if it was real, and secondly,
we needed to make it look convincing.

32:10.728 --> 32:13.754
- We did?
- We needed to fool him.

32:16.467 --> 32:19.129
What does he know? He wouldn't
have been able to tell the difference, Vala.

32:19.237 --> 32:21.034
Actually, I probably would have.

32:21.139 --> 32:23.198
Oh, please! You didn't know
it was a bomb until I told you so.

32:23.308 --> 32:24.502
I had suspected it.

32:24.609 --> 32:26.372
- No, you didn't.
- Check my service logs.

32:26.477 --> 32:28.672
- Stop talking.
- I specifically made a note...

32:30.848 --> 32:33.146
What's the countdown clock set to?

32:34.118 --> 32:38.714
An hour, give or take a few minutes.

32:45.763 --> 32:47.993
- It's not that big a deal.
- Oh, really?

32:48.099 --> 32:49.396
Once we interface it with the gate,

32:49.500 --> 32:52.367
establishing a secure connection should
completely deplete its power source,

32:52.470 --> 32:53.869
which would mean it won't explode.

32:53.972 --> 32:57.931
We now have less than 50, give or take
a few, minutes to get that done.

32:58.042 --> 32:59.771
- Maybe more.
- Count on less.

just opened up.

33:25.436 --> 33:27.370
What do you see?

33:27.472 --> 33:30.407
Cicero. It would appear he has escaped.

33:33.578 --> 33:34.567
He what?

33:34.946 --> 33:38.712
He left. He just left.
Why would he do that?

33:39.317 --> 33:42.514
(SCOFFS) Looks like he slipped
right through your fingers.

33:42.620 --> 33:45.418
He was working with us, you idiot.

33:45.523 --> 33:48.117
How do you think we got our guns back?

33:48.826 --> 33:51.920
It's so sad that you feel the need
to lie to me.

33:52.897 --> 33:55.229
What the hell does Cicero think
he's doing?

33:55.333 --> 33:57.858
I know it sounds crazy, but it's true.

33:57.969 --> 34:00.904
The pyramid ring acts as
a connection point between many worlds.

34:01.005 --> 34:05.533
Many of us had thought so for some time,
but were unable to activate it, to prove it.

34:05.643 --> 34:08.942
They aren't rebels. They don't know
anything about our world.

34:09.047 --> 34:11.174
Their demands would prove
otherwise, Cicero.

34:11.282 --> 34:14.479
I told them what to say.
I told them what to demand.

34:14.585 --> 34:17.554
- You did what?
- All they need is time.

34:17.655 --> 34:20.146
Our ring is broken, and once
their friends realize they're stuck here,

34:20.258 --> 34:21.247
they'll send help.

34:21.359 --> 34:24.556
Their friends? Others are on the way?

34:24.662 --> 34:27.432
Yes. They just needed to stall a bit,
so I told them what to say.

34:27.432 --> 34:28.057
Yes. They just needed to stall a bit,
so I told them what to say.

34:28.166 --> 34:30.157
I know, it maybe wasn't
the best thing to do,

34:30.268 --> 34:32.259
but a chance for us
to actually communicate

34:32.370 --> 34:34.429
with beings from another world...

34:34.539 --> 34:38.134
This may be the greatest day
in the history of our planet.

<i>I'm starting to get a little worried.</i>

34:41.145 --> 34:42.407
Welcome to the club.

34:42.814 --> 34:46.045
No, this Quartus guy has checked in
with me every 10 minutes like clockwork.

34:46.651 --> 34:47.618
And?

34:47.718 --> 34:49.242
<i>And it's been over 20 minutes now.</i>

34:49.353 --> 34:51.617

34:51.722 --> 34:53.246
<i>How goes it on your end?</i>

34:53.357 --> 34:57.225
- How goes it on our end?
- I think I have it. Maybe.

34:58.396 --> 34:59.624
Vala.

34:59.730 --> 35:02.164
There's a 70% chance that
if we dial manually,

35:02.266 --> 35:03.665
we'll be able to establish a connection,

35:03.768 --> 35:06.532
and a 50% chance
the bomb will just go off.

35:07.371 --> 35:09.100
That's 120%.

35:09.207 --> 35:13.303
Well, there's some crossover, where
we establish a wormhole and it blows up.

35:13.411 --> 35:15.072
Jackson, did you catch any of that?

35:15.279 --> 35:16.610
Yeah, 100% chance
we should have brought someone

35:16.714 --> 35:17.703
that knows what they're doing.

35:17.815 --> 35:19.783
Yeah, I heard. Daniel out.

35:24.989 --> 35:28.356
Well, I'm going to need your help
dialing this thing.

35:28.893 --> 35:31.453
Okay. This one.

35:32.396 --> 35:33.420
Up the top.

35:35.133 --> 35:38.625
- Have you spoken with the Viceroy?
- Yes.

35:39.470 --> 35:42.928
The Viceroy has denied all
of their demands.

35:46.878 --> 35:50.473
We have to end this now.

36:04.595 --> 36:06.654
SARAN: What does that thing do?

36:06.764 --> 36:10.723
Is that a bomb?
Why is it lighting up like that?

36:10.835 --> 36:14.498
Are you activating it?
You're going to kill us all, aren't you?

36:14.605 --> 36:17.165
Your restraints won't hold me forever.

36:17.275 --> 36:19.436
You might as well set me free
and turn yourselves in,

Oh, my.

Look, we never wanted to hurt anybody.
We just want to go home, okay?

38:46.957 --> 38:48.652
And that ring is how we do that.

38:50.828 --> 38:52.557
Please, just let us leave.

38:52.663 --> 38:54.927
All we have to do is walk through that.

Once we're gone, it will shut down,
and no one will be harmed. I promise.

We've all been there.

Hell, when I first heard there were alien
worlds and races out there, I freaked out.

39:14.752 --> 39:16.185
I was afraid.

39:17.154 --> 39:20.920
Afraid of how advanced they might be,
afraid of what their intentions were,

39:21.025 --> 39:23.357
afraid they might come to my world
and kill me,

39:23.461 --> 39:26.658
and I'll be honest with you,
there are worlds and races out there

39:26.764 --> 39:30.564
who do mean you and your people harm,
but we're not one of them.

39:30.668 --> 39:33.762
And you're lucky you ran into us
before you ran into them.

39:33.871 --> 39:36.999
Now, I will admit that
our first contact was not ideal.

39:37.108 --> 39:40.168
In fact, it could well be our worst.

39:41.746 --> 39:45.477
But you do not want your first foray
into interplanetary relations

39:45.583 --> 39:47.676
to be a violent one.

39:53.224 --> 39:55.158
We're a peaceful people.

39:56.127 --> 39:59.619
But we do not take acts of aggression
lying down.

40:01.198 --> 40:04.895

42:23.040 --> 42:24.598
Could it be a problem with that gate?

42:24.708 --> 42:27.905
Say, as a result of some tampering
with the gate to get a connection?

42:28.012 --> 42:30.242
Hey, I saved our hides,
thank you very much.

42:30.347 --> 42:32.440
We don't think so, sir.
Our attempts to dial should have worked.

42:32.550 --> 42:34.381
They have undoubtedly buried the gate.

42:34.485 --> 42:36.817
So they just stuck their heads in the sand?

42:36.921 --> 42:38.479
Even after everything you told them?

42:38.589 --> 42:40.523
Maybe they figure they've got
their own issues to deal with

42:40.624 --> 42:42.455
before they start dealing
with the ones out here, sir.

42:42.560 --> 42:45.620
Unfortunately, we don't have that option,
do we?
