WEBVTT

02:18.413 --> 02:19.546
Are these like that?

02:19.548 --> 02:21.314
What?

02:21.316 --> 02:22.515
It's pretty off.

02:22.517 --> 02:23.653
Uh-huh.

03:19.776 --> 03:20.641
Hey!

03:20.643 --> 03:22.410
- Hey, how are you?
- There you are.

03:23.079 --> 03:24.814
Howdy.
Hey, have a seat.

03:34.991 --> 03:37.593
That's stupid.
I see you all the time.

03:38.493 --> 03:41.128
You know, I'm going to
be in your fields next week.

03:41.130 --> 03:42.129
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

03:42.131 --> 03:43.063
- Bill's?
- Yeah.

03:43.065 --> 03:44.832
All right, I'll keep
an eye out for you.

03:44.834 --> 03:46.002
Yeah.

03:48.537 --> 03:49.939
You wanna get a drink?

03:51.741 --> 03:52.775
Nah, not tonight.

03:56.846 --> 03:58.612
How about lunch next week?

03:58.614 --> 04:00.515
Yeah, sounds good. Yeah.

04:03.485 --> 04:06.020
Hey, man,
I've gotta head out but, um,

04:06.022 --> 04:07.556
I'll see you around, alright?

04:12.829 --> 04:14.030
Shut up.

04:15.731 --> 04:17.031
Another one?

04:17.033 --> 04:18.366
Yes, please.

05:15.457 --> 05:16.726
<i>Pop the trunk!</i>

05:30.806 --> 05:31.707
You hungry?

05:32.942 --> 05:34.540
Ooh, I like your lips!

05:34.542 --> 05:35.645
Thank you!

05:52.261 --> 05:54.128
After school,
you're gonna be great.

05:54.130 --> 05:57.865
Probably get hired at some cool
tech company or something.

05:57.867 --> 06:00.533
I can't. Why would I
even work at a tech company?

06:00.535 --> 06:03.503
I don't know anything
about that stuff - at all.

06:03.505 --> 06:05.141
No, Jules, you haven't
even started yet.

06:08.210 --> 06:09.843
You could come live with me.

06:09.845 --> 06:14.148
Maya, you need to finish
your classes and graduate.

06:14.150 --> 06:17.685
I will be fine. I will be good.

06:17.687 --> 06:19.820
I will figure it out.

06:19.822 --> 06:22.591
Thank you for being
such a good friend.

06:31.600 --> 06:34.668
Is there a piece of paper
when you open up the bag?

06:34.670 --> 06:36.270
Like, the instructions
or something?

06:36.272 --> 06:36.937
Hey, guys!

06:36.939 --> 06:38.806
I don't know.
Hi!

06:38.808 --> 06:40.774
I didn't remember you
guys were coming here.

06:40.776 --> 06:41.809
So early.

06:41.811 --> 06:43.177
Good to see you, dude.

06:43.179 --> 06:44.914
What's going on?
Good to see you.

06:45.815 --> 06:46.814
Wouldn't miss it.

06:46.816 --> 06:49.083
I didn't know you guys
were bringing a tent.

06:49.085 --> 06:51.051
Yeah, it's my dad's old tent.

06:51.053 --> 06:52.820
My mom found it in the garage.

06:52.822 --> 06:55.122
Looks great.
This is like the perfect set.

06:55.124 --> 06:57.157
Yeah! When are you
gonna get started?

06:57.159 --> 06:59.261
I don't know. We're waiting for
some more people to get here.

08:07.797 --> 08:10.330
Do you think
he'll take off anything more?

08:10.332 --> 08:12.199
Eww, no.

08:12.201 --> 08:13.267
Maybe!

08:13.269 --> 08:16.338
He must be high out of his mind.
It's way too cold.

08:19.909 --> 08:22.011
I bet he stays
by that fire all night.

08:25.281 --> 08:28.382
If he's smart he will.
He's gonna freeze otherwise.

08:28.384 --> 08:30.651
He took, like, four Mollys.

08:30.653 --> 08:33.255
No! That's really dangerous.

08:34.390 --> 08:35.856
Greedy!

08:35.857 --> 08:37.424
Greedy. Yeah.

08:37.426 --> 08:39.693
Our Molly guy
didn't show up, so...

08:39.695 --> 08:43.063
Yeah, no that's him.
He's the Molly guy.

08:43.065 --> 08:46.100
You gotta get it
from him somehow,

08:46.102 --> 08:47.970
before he takes them all.

08:55.744 --> 08:57.344
So last rave of the year.

08:57.346 --> 09:01.383
Hmm. It's the best one
this year, I think.

09:12.261 --> 09:14.828
I'm gonna go back in
the barn. Do you want to come?

09:14.830 --> 09:15.762
Yeah.

09:15.764 --> 09:18.267
I wanna hang out
here for a little.

09:22.438 --> 09:24.240
I think I'm gonna head back too.

13:23.278 --> 13:24.446
You ok?

13:27.249 --> 13:29.418
She's just never
been with a guy before.

13:59.749 --> 14:01.183
I'm sorry.

14:02.050 --> 14:03.085
I can't.

16:05.440 --> 16:06.643
Hey!

16:10.178 --> 16:11.280
Shit.

16:14.116 --> 16:15.183
Hey.

16:55.324 --> 16:57.324
Are you keeping
pressure on that?

16:57.326 --> 16:58.761
Keep your hand tight on that.

17:46.541 --> 17:48.443
Well, you're looking well.

17:49.144 --> 17:51.513
A lot better than
the last time I saw you.

18:01.323 --> 18:02.923
Do you need
some juice or water?

18:02.925 --> 18:03.758
No, thank you.

18:03.760 --> 18:05.593
Let me know
if you need anything.

18:05.595 --> 18:06.629
Just use this, ok?

18:09.832 --> 18:11.934
Hey, is your girlfriend ok?

18:14.671 --> 18:15.936
Oh, you probably...

18:15.938 --> 18:17.672
You probably don't remember,

18:17.674 --> 18:20.574
but you and I talked
all the way to the hospital.

18:20.576 --> 18:23.412
You know, you slept for
a little bit, but we talked.

18:28.283 --> 18:30.787
Oh. Um, what did I say?

18:32.421 --> 18:34.989
You talked about
dropping out of school

18:34.991 --> 18:37.357
so you guys
could be together.

18:37.359 --> 18:38.726
You were worried.

18:38.728 --> 18:41.430
You told her you loved her.

18:44.533 --> 18:47.904
I'm Freddy, by the way,
if you don't remember.

18:51.573 --> 18:54.577
She's not, uh, doing too well,
I don't think.

18:56.746 --> 18:58.012
It's not your fault.

18:58.014 --> 19:01.015
You know, that corner,
it comes out of nowhere.

19:01.017 --> 19:02.515
I'm sorry.

19:02.517 --> 19:05.420
Don't be sorry. You have nothing
to be sorry about.

19:07.724 --> 19:10.658
You're a little bit
like my daughter.

19:10.660 --> 19:11.759
When she was little, once,

19:11.761 --> 19:15.528
she skinned her knee and
she kept apologizing for it.

19:15.530 --> 19:16.697
Oh, I'm sorry.

19:16.699 --> 19:17.898
Don't say that!

19:17.900 --> 19:19.902
Don't be sorry about anything.

19:20.937 --> 19:22.304
Don't ever be sorry.

19:28.077 --> 19:29.812
How old's your daughter?

19:35.918 --> 19:36.717
I - probably...

19:36.719 --> 19:39.021
Twenties, probably, now...
Maybe?

19:41.858 --> 19:43.523
Do you have any other kids?

19:43.525 --> 19:46.428
Yeah, I have
a son and a daughter.

19:47.663 --> 19:50.798
What about you?
Where's your family?

19:50.800 --> 19:55.069
I don't know.
They sent me a box of stuff.

19:55.071 --> 19:58.038
We're not really
talking right now.

19:58.040 --> 20:00.275
Ah, I got it.

20:00.977 --> 20:03.946
I think I know how they feel.
I don't talk to my kids either.

20:04.781 --> 20:05.982
Why not?

20:08.885 --> 20:11.353
It's just been so long,
I forgot.

20:15.124 --> 20:17.827
My mom doesn't like what
I was doing with Jules.

20:19.996 --> 20:21.463
I got it.

20:23.666 --> 20:25.966
Oh, I forgot.
I've got, um...

20:25.968 --> 20:29.637
When I was cleaning my truck
I found that phone.

20:29.639 --> 20:30.971
It's either you or Jules'.

20:30.973 --> 20:33.007
There's a picture
of you guys and a kitty.

20:33.009 --> 20:34.610
Thank you!

20:36.145 --> 20:38.378
Well, I'd better get to work.

20:38.380 --> 20:42.817
But I'd like to see you again,
or stay in touch or something.

20:42.819 --> 20:43.584
Yeah.

20:43.586 --> 20:44.885
I wanna know
how you're doing.

20:44.887 --> 20:45.786
Yeah.

20:45.788 --> 20:46.789
- Ok?
- Uh-huh.

20:49.659 --> 20:51.359
Alright, I'll see you later.

20:55.598 --> 20:57.566
Identify the object
you see on the card.

20:58.400 --> 21:00.002
- Guitar.
- Good.

21:02.537 --> 21:04.504
Arm chair? Or chair?

21:04.506 --> 21:05.741
Just chair. Good.

21:07.810 --> 21:08.843
Ear.

21:08.845 --> 21:10.478
Yeah.

21:11.948 --> 21:13.614
Do you need
what time it is, or just -

21:13.616 --> 21:15.115
- Just the object.
- It's a clock.

21:15.117 --> 21:16.118
Good.

21:17.787 --> 21:19.088
Sandwich.

21:21.824 --> 21:22.925
Ear.

21:25.194 --> 21:26.528
Sandwich.

21:47.515 --> 21:49.683
I got a little bit
of a sandwich left -

21:49.685 --> 21:50.918
do you think he'll want it?

21:50.920 --> 21:52.119
- That'll be great.
- Yeah?

21:52.121 --> 21:53.488
Yeah, he'll like that.

22:01.463 --> 22:05.165
There you go.
Such a good boy.

22:05.167 --> 22:06.468
Yeah.

22:06.936 --> 22:08.938
He's a chicken salad fan.

22:10.706 --> 22:11.908
It's like he was hungry!

22:13.475 --> 22:15.709
Now, he really got bit
by a rattlesnake?

22:15.711 --> 22:16.509
Yeah.

22:16.511 --> 22:17.878
How? Where was that?

22:17.880 --> 22:19.246
Just by my house.

22:19.248 --> 22:21.918
You can see a white mark
up here...

24:07.323 --> 24:08.523
<i>Hello?</i>

24:12.595 --> 24:14.128
H-hello?

24:14.130 --> 24:15.765
<i>Who is this?</i>

24:20.836 --> 24:24.607
It's, uh, it's...
Andrea?

24:29.178 --> 24:30.312
<i>Yeah.</i>

24:46.128 --> 24:47.163
Hello?

24:49.365 --> 24:50.833
<i>Oh, my god.</i>

25:12.955 --> 25:14.688
<i>Ok, so follow the pen
with your eyes</i>

25:14.690 --> 25:15.791
<i>but don't move your head.</i>

25:25.134 --> 25:26.268
Ok, good.

25:28.938 --> 25:31.205
Ok, so how are you feeling?

25:31.207 --> 25:32.706
- Good.
- Good?

25:32.708 --> 25:33.674
Uh-huh.

25:33.676 --> 25:35.442
Well, I'm going to put in
a recommendation

25:35.444 --> 25:37.146
that you be released this week.

25:41.016 --> 25:44.987
It's weird. I can't write.

25:46.122 --> 25:48.858
I can write, but...

25:49.725 --> 25:52.025
Your letters are wrong.

25:52.027 --> 25:53.229
Yeah.

25:57.233 --> 25:59.199
Are they going to
let you go home yet?

25:59.201 --> 26:00.868
Yeah.

26:00.870 --> 26:02.771
That's good.

26:03.939 --> 26:06.874
I need to go to a specialist.

26:06.876 --> 26:08.878
Yeah, you told me that.

26:10.813 --> 26:11.914
Oh, yeah.

26:14.083 --> 26:15.951
Hey...

26:19.121 --> 26:21.023
This is a good idea.

26:24.860 --> 26:28.097
No. No!

26:37.006 --> 26:43.477
I know.
I know, but we have to!

26:44.847 --> 26:46.847
I know. But it's good, though.

26:47.883 --> 26:49.983
Argh, I wasn't even...
Maya, no!

26:49.985 --> 26:51.351
I wasn't even ready.

26:51.353 --> 26:52.286
Here we go.

26:59.328 --> 27:00.362
Let me see.

27:02.998 --> 27:05.799
Oh, my god.

27:05.801 --> 27:07.970
No! Ugh.

27:09.972 --> 27:11.805
Wait, there's gotta be...

27:11.807 --> 27:13.842
Oh, so cute!

27:17.913 --> 27:19.381
You got any big plans tonight?

27:23.852 --> 27:25.354
It's so weird.

27:27.056 --> 27:31.992
I was, like, thinking about it,

27:31.994 --> 27:34.196
but it doesn't come out.

27:42.304 --> 27:44.473
Are you going to see
a physical therapist?

27:50.379 --> 27:51.747
I think so.

27:53.482 --> 27:56.352
There's that course at the pool.
We should do it together.

28:02.258 --> 28:05.261
Yeah. Can David come too?

28:08.897 --> 28:11.000
No. It's just girls.

28:12.368 --> 28:15.237
Aw, you're no fun.

28:16.505 --> 28:18.240
No, that's the rules.

28:24.313 --> 28:28.616
My mom said I might need to come
home for a while after this.

28:28.618 --> 28:30.252
When did she say that?

28:35.625 --> 28:37.459
- Ready to go?
- Yeah.

28:42.231 --> 28:44.099
- Do you want this?
- No.

28:47.936 --> 28:49.238
- Last chance.
- No!

28:52.975 --> 28:54.209
Let's go.

29:31.648 --> 29:32.981
Oh, for me?

29:45.961 --> 29:47.096
What's that?

29:58.040 --> 29:59.439
It's our house key.

29:59.441 --> 30:02.244
They took mine away when I
told them about Jules.

30:04.346 --> 30:06.346
That's a good thing, though,
right?

30:06.348 --> 30:10.285
Not really. They said I could
have it back when it was over.

30:10.919 --> 30:12.921
At least they're
still supporting you.

31:30.399 --> 31:32.600
Hey, buddy.
Is your mom there?

31:32.602 --> 31:34.403
Mom!

31:35.504 --> 31:37.607
- Who is it, honey?
- I don't know.

31:39.107 --> 31:40.207
Andrea?

31:45.180 --> 31:47.316
Hey, please open the door.

31:53.355 --> 31:55.725
How about...
Can I just have five minutes?

31:56.626 --> 31:58.560
I came a long way.

32:04.701 --> 32:06.201
Andrea...

32:26.288 --> 32:28.323
Are those your kids?

32:38.133 --> 32:39.702
Do you talk to Marco?

32:43.205 --> 32:45.040
You don't get to ask me that.

32:53.850 --> 32:55.718
I brought...
I brought you this.

32:57.119 --> 32:59.622
I wish it was more.
I'm gonna give you more.

33:16.271 --> 33:17.573
Why are you here?

33:30.519 --> 33:32.152
You can finish your cigarette.

33:32.154 --> 33:34.591
There's a gate over there.
You can let yourself out.

34:32.715 --> 34:36.485
<i>Hey, Maya. How are you?</i>

34:37.954 --> 34:39.719
<i>My mom says hi.</i>

34:39.722 --> 34:41.623
<i>Cool.
Tell her I said 'hi' too.</i>

34:42.992 --> 34:46.194
<i>Let me go find
someplace quiet to talk.</i>

34:48.630 --> 34:49.864
<i>What's up?</i>

34:49.866 --> 34:52.565
<i>They let you out?
That's great!</i>

34:52.567 --> 34:54.802
<i>Yeah, I guess so.</i>

34:54.804 --> 34:58.371
<i>Sorry I didn't text you
to let you know.</i>

34:58.373 --> 35:00.875
<i>It's been kind of hectic
around here.</i>

35:00.877 --> 35:05.012
<i>My mom is taking me
out of school</i>

35:05.014 --> 35:07.347
<i>for the rest of the semester.</i>

35:07.349 --> 35:08.783
<i>I don't know why.</i>

35:08.785 --> 35:10.450
<i>I mean, I do,</i>

35:10.452 --> 35:14.755
<i>but I think
they're all overreacting.</i>

35:14.757 --> 35:16.757
<i>They just want you
to feel better.</i>

35:16.759 --> 35:20.495
<i>I am feeling better.
That's what's frustrating.</i>

35:21.764 --> 35:23.265
<i>Anyways...</i>

35:26.368 --> 35:29.302
<i>My mom wants me
to get off the phone.</i>

35:29.304 --> 35:31.806
<i>Ok.
Well, can I come see you?</i>

35:31.808 --> 35:33.643
<i>Yeah, any time.</i>

36:57.359 --> 36:59.026
Oh, this is not nice.

36:59.028 --> 37:00.495
You gotta throw up.

37:02.364 --> 37:03.800
I just...

37:05.768 --> 37:07.502
Don't be by me.

37:08.303 --> 37:10.704
I'm not going to leave you
in here by yourself.

37:10.706 --> 37:11.872
I don't think...

37:11.874 --> 37:14.708
I don't care. You should've
left me at home by myself.

37:14.710 --> 37:16.478
Jules, it's...

37:20.917 --> 37:23.085
Everyone is looking at me
like I'm fucked up.

37:25.788 --> 37:27.389
Do you get that?

37:29.625 --> 37:30.760
I'm...

37:35.430 --> 37:37.131
I think they're happy
to see you.

37:37.133 --> 37:38.935
I'm embarrassed.

37:45.007 --> 37:46.374
I'm proud of you.

38:22.078 --> 38:24.111
You have a lot of cats.

38:24.113 --> 38:26.682
We do, and they all need homes.

38:30.485 --> 38:31.654
Hi.

38:36.926 --> 38:38.458
These guys are great.

38:38.460 --> 38:40.395
Uh-huh. I love this one.

38:40.963 --> 38:42.732
Hello. Hi.

38:43.199 --> 38:44.667
Hi.

38:45.201 --> 38:48.769
I don't know whether
I want a cat or a dog or...

38:48.771 --> 38:50.704
I can show you the dogs.

38:50.706 --> 38:51.974
Was that a cat?

38:54.977 --> 38:56.646
Hey.

39:01.784 --> 39:02.985
Maybe a cat.

39:09.491 --> 39:11.091
Yeow! Wow.

39:11.093 --> 39:12.793
Let's...
Can we see the dogs?

39:12.795 --> 39:14.063
- Yeah, definitely.
- Yeah.

39:18.701 --> 39:22.069
Hey, baby. Hello.

39:22.071 --> 39:23.704
That one is beautiful.

39:23.706 --> 39:25.975
She's very beautiful. Very calm

39:27.810 --> 39:28.811
Yeah.

39:30.913 --> 39:33.881
Hey, puppy dog. Hey.

39:33.883 --> 39:35.182
I can't, I can't take it.

39:35.184 --> 39:37.687
- Yeah, it's hard.
- I want all of them. I know.

39:41.590 --> 39:42.658
Hey.

40:07.183 --> 40:09.018
- I'll take this one.
- Ok.

40:13.155 --> 40:14.023
C'mon!

40:23.599 --> 40:24.898
Can you jump up in there?

40:24.900 --> 40:26.268
Oh, good boy!

40:31.741 --> 40:32.708
Hey!

40:33.342 --> 40:35.644
Hello. Hey.

40:39.081 --> 40:42.818
This is my truck,
and it is a good truck.

40:46.722 --> 40:47.823
Hello.

40:48.391 --> 40:51.660
You and I are going to go all
kinds of places in this thing.

42:06.402 --> 42:07.301
I'm Anne.

42:07.303 --> 42:09.136
Hi, Anne, nice to meet you.
I'm Maya.

42:09.138 --> 42:10.771
Maya, nice to meet you!

42:10.773 --> 42:11.839
- Hi.
- Jules.

42:11.841 --> 42:13.207
Jules, nice to meet you!

42:13.209 --> 42:15.843
- Barbara.
- Barbara, nice to meet you.

42:15.845 --> 42:16.977
Thanks for having us today.

42:16.979 --> 42:18.914
- Cold water.
- It's warming up.

42:21.083 --> 42:23.319
Try and go
really high out of the water.

43:26.982 --> 43:28.984
Do you wanna
go off the diving board?

43:30.152 --> 43:31.952
Your mom's gonna
be here in a little bit,

43:31.954 --> 43:33.689
but we can have
some fun before then.

43:36.892 --> 43:38.392
You can hang out here
if you want,

43:38.394 --> 43:39.695
but I'm gonna do it.

45:05.014 --> 45:06.581
Jules, what gives?

45:06.583 --> 45:08.851
You haven't
talked to me all day.

45:10.119 --> 45:11.553
What happened?

45:13.055 --> 45:14.857
I don't know.

45:19.261 --> 45:20.961
Didn't you like it?

45:20.963 --> 45:22.331
Yeah, of course.

45:24.099 --> 45:25.600
I don't feel right.

45:25.602 --> 45:30.337
I do normal things,
and I don't feel right.

45:32.408 --> 45:35.444
- It's ok. I've got you.
- No, you don't!

45:38.147 --> 45:40.182
I just need
to be done for today.

45:53.429 --> 45:55.429
I am so sorry, Maya.

45:55.431 --> 46:00.100
I know that you thought that
we were going to be together,

46:00.102 --> 46:01.937
but we're not.

46:03.939 --> 46:06.442
I don't even think I'm gay.

46:07.042 --> 46:10.611
I... I just have
a lot of other things

46:10.613 --> 46:12.981
that I need to
deal with right now.

46:17.019 --> 46:19.622
I gotta go.
I'll talk to you later?

46:44.213 --> 46:46.348
Hey! There you are.

46:46.548 --> 46:48.050
Hey!

46:48.618 --> 46:50.552
What's a chemical synthesis?

46:55.290 --> 46:56.525
Anabolism?

46:59.962 --> 47:01.629
What do you call a polymer

47:01.631 --> 47:04.634
formed by
condensation synthesis?

47:05.167 --> 47:07.336
C'mon, I'm not gonna
do your homework.

47:10.572 --> 47:12.305
You have it right there.

47:12.307 --> 47:14.143
Polysaccharide.

47:17.212 --> 47:18.547
You ok?

47:20.249 --> 47:22.249
You don't want me
to finish this up for you?

47:22.251 --> 47:24.052
No, I'm almost done.

47:29.024 --> 47:31.191
Hey, come on.

47:31.193 --> 47:32.660
I've got something
for your dorm room.

47:32.662 --> 47:34.363
I'm hurrying up, ok?

47:47.543 --> 47:48.743
How does it work?

47:48.745 --> 47:51.545
Like, I get how
on a computer

47:51.547 --> 47:54.114
you're playing a song
off of a file,

47:54.116 --> 47:57.417
but how does it work
on a record?

47:57.419 --> 47:59.221
How does music come out?

48:01.791 --> 48:03.190
You serious?

48:03.192 --> 48:05.360
Yeah! It doesn't make any sense.

48:06.729 --> 48:11.099
I mean, did you ever have
a music box as a kid?

48:14.637 --> 48:16.470
Um...

48:16.472 --> 48:21.475
Well, the needle is made of
a very, very small diamond.

48:21.477 --> 48:22.810
There's a diamond?

48:22.812 --> 48:25.682
Yeah. And, um...

48:29.218 --> 48:31.621
There's these
really tiny grooves...

48:34.456 --> 48:36.356
...that it drags along,

48:36.358 --> 48:40.628
and as it drags along
it creates these vibrations,

48:40.630 --> 48:43.698
or sound waves,

48:43.700 --> 48:48.368
and it travels up the arm
to an electronic sensor,

48:48.370 --> 48:50.403
which then
sends it to a speaker.

48:50.405 --> 48:52.472
And that's essentially
how it works.

48:52.474 --> 48:53.608
Yeah, that makes sense,

48:53.610 --> 48:56.076
'cause I know it would spiral
all the way to the end.

48:56.078 --> 48:57.578
Yeah.

48:57.580 --> 49:00.717
And hopefully
what you hear is sublime.

49:02.351 --> 49:05.185
Or, not the band, but you know.

49:05.187 --> 49:06.355
Got it.

49:07.289 --> 49:09.258
Or it makes you move.

49:15.130 --> 49:16.496
I don't wanna
freak you out or anything,

49:16.498 --> 49:20.302
but... I have to tell you
that I like you.

49:22.170 --> 49:23.503
I mean,
I don't wanna change anything,

49:23.505 --> 49:26.540
because I like
hanging out with you.

49:26.542 --> 49:29.344
You know,
I like that we're friends.

49:31.346 --> 49:32.514
But, yeah.

49:36.351 --> 49:38.287
How long have you felt this way?

49:39.622 --> 49:42.659
Not long.
This is pretty new.

49:46.261 --> 49:47.730
I'm gay.

49:49.866 --> 49:53.770
Wait. I mean, I kinda figured,
but you're like all the way?

49:54.871 --> 49:56.171
Yeah.

49:58.206 --> 50:01.578
Yeah. I probably
shouldn't have brought that up.

50:07.416 --> 50:09.619
- So it's fine?
- Yeah.

50:10.319 --> 50:11.688
I mean...

50:27.536 --> 50:29.271
Sorry.

50:32.809 --> 50:35.410
Uh. So, give me your hand.

50:43.352 --> 50:44.451
Like this?

50:44.453 --> 50:46.455
You've done this before, right?

50:47.790 --> 50:48.891
Yeah, but...

50:57.466 --> 50:58.768
Like that?

51:17.820 --> 51:20.188
I don't like that.
I don't like feeling it.

51:20.857 --> 51:23.223
Oh... Yeah.

51:23.225 --> 51:25.258
It takes me out of it.

51:25.260 --> 51:26.428
Sorry.

51:34.569 --> 51:36.471
Can you go faster?

51:42.745 --> 51:45.579
Thanks.
It feels really good.

51:45.581 --> 51:48.316
Um, what do you want me to do?

51:52.521 --> 51:54.189
Can I fuck you?

51:59.528 --> 52:01.463
Nah, it's all good.

52:03.465 --> 52:04.834
I can make myself cum.

52:05.702 --> 52:07.302
Is that alright?

52:08.004 --> 52:09.371
Yeah.

52:14.276 --> 52:15.676
Is that?

52:15.678 --> 52:17.780
Is that, um...?

53:05.094 --> 53:06.729
You have a shower, right?

53:07.797 --> 53:09.599
Do you need a towel?

53:12.434 --> 53:13.435
Yeah.

54:09.826 --> 54:12.392
<i>There's a dude over there
just gave me the thumbs up.</i>

54:12.394 --> 54:15.564
He thinks I'm on a hot date
with a young girl.

54:18.301 --> 54:20.937
I figured they'd think
you were my daughter.

54:21.637 --> 54:24.571
I saw her.
I saw her last week.

54:24.573 --> 54:26.539
It felt so good.

54:26.541 --> 54:28.474
That's amazing!

54:28.476 --> 54:30.644
Yeah. I mean,
we'll see where it goes,

54:30.646 --> 54:32.682
but it's a step.

54:32.982 --> 54:35.550
I brought my dog
to play with my grandkids.

54:35.751 --> 54:37.620
How many kids does she have?

54:40.122 --> 54:41.521
I don't - two or three.

54:41.523 --> 54:43.123
I mean,
I wasn't there very long.

54:43.125 --> 54:45.059
But I'm just
really proud of her.

54:45.061 --> 54:47.194
I'm gonna go back next week.

54:47.196 --> 54:49.196
- Yeah!
- So we'll see, but that's...

54:49.198 --> 54:50.432
It's a step.

54:50.733 --> 54:52.733
How about you? How's Jules?

54:52.735 --> 54:54.500
Uh, she's ok.

54:54.502 --> 54:55.603
Um...

54:55.605 --> 54:57.607
She's staying with her mom.

54:59.642 --> 55:01.644
Well, that's good, right?

55:03.112 --> 55:05.813
Um, we started
a water therapy class.

55:05.815 --> 55:08.150
That's probably great
for both of you, right?

55:09.051 --> 55:11.051
Yeah. What do you do?

55:11.053 --> 55:14.154
I work the pumpjacks.
Oil derricks.

55:14.156 --> 55:15.923
Whoa! How is that?

55:15.925 --> 55:18.594
It's good.
Business is really good.

55:20.897 --> 55:23.197
What about school.
What are you studying?

55:23.199 --> 55:24.732
I haven't decided yet.

55:24.734 --> 55:27.067
I'm trying to
figure that out right now.

55:27.069 --> 55:30.838
I'm actually thinking about
not doing classes next semester

55:30.840 --> 55:33.107
and just going
on a trip instead.

55:33.109 --> 55:36.143
Um, 'cause it feels so weird
going back to normal.

55:36.145 --> 55:37.543
Because it isn't.

55:37.545 --> 55:39.213
Well, you don't have to go back.

55:39.215 --> 55:41.516
Yeah, take some time.
Get your bearings.

55:42.084 --> 55:43.817
This is boring advice,

55:43.819 --> 55:47.054
but you ought to think about
something stable, like nursing,

55:47.056 --> 55:48.556
becoming a nurse.

55:49.125 --> 55:51.058
The life just went
out of your eyes.

55:51.060 --> 55:52.728
That's pretty fucking boring.

55:57.532 --> 55:59.835
What about you?
Do you have a girlfriend?

56:04.040 --> 56:05.207
You know what...

56:06.943 --> 56:09.176
I don't know
what I'm talking about.

56:09.178 --> 56:10.947
Don't worry about it.
Cheers.

56:12.248 --> 56:13.448
Cheers.

56:14.951 --> 56:16.583
Do you wanna do a shot?

56:16.585 --> 56:18.486
Oh, fuck yes. Yes.

56:31.267 --> 56:33.102
Yeah, hello.

56:35.004 --> 56:36.270
Hello.

56:36.272 --> 56:37.840
She's a good girl.

56:38.941 --> 56:41.677
Yeah, yeah.
What a good doggie.

56:44.546 --> 56:46.182
I'm gonna text Luis.

57:46.541 --> 57:48.778
- What's up?
- What's up, man?

57:50.880 --> 57:52.379
How you doin'?
Hey, Maya.

57:52.381 --> 57:53.247
No Jules?

57:53.249 --> 57:55.716
No. It's nice
to see you, too, though.

57:55.718 --> 57:57.084
So sad. Good to see you!

57:57.086 --> 57:58.685
Let's get rid of that stuff.
C'mon, guys.

57:58.687 --> 58:00.621
Excuse me.

58:00.623 --> 58:01.455
Alright, guys.

58:01.457 --> 58:02.656
You can set your stuff
over there.

58:02.658 --> 58:06.226
I'll let y'all get settled up.
I'll go grab some drinks.

58:06.228 --> 58:07.630
See y'all soon.

58:08.030 --> 58:09.830
We'll blow that
air mattress up later.

58:09.832 --> 58:11.165
It's more better.

58:11.167 --> 58:13.869
Do you think there's a safe
place for my backpack?

58:15.938 --> 58:19.108
Um, probably underneath
the mattress over there.

58:20.743 --> 58:22.011
I think I'm just
gonna wear it.

59:49.899 --> 59:51.167
Do you live here?

59:51.467 --> 59:53.102
I live a couple blocks away.

59:54.904 --> 59:56.238
Do you wanna get out of here?

59:58.774 --> 59:59.775
Yeah.

01:00:00.376 --> 01:00:02.476
I... I have some bad news.

01:00:02.478 --> 01:00:03.679
What?

01:00:04.413 --> 01:00:08.215
I live with my parents,

01:00:08.217 --> 01:00:10.352
so I don't have anywhere
for us to go.

01:00:12.855 --> 01:00:14.056
What about you?

01:00:16.825 --> 01:00:18.294
I have an idea, though.

01:00:22.831 --> 01:00:24.466
- <i>Cheers.</i>
- <i>Cheers.</i>

01:00:30.506 --> 01:00:33.709
So, how are the boys at Bill's?

01:00:34.910 --> 01:00:36.843
I don't want to talk about work.

01:00:36.845 --> 01:00:40.147
Aw, c'mon. I wanna know.
I mean, you look tired.

01:00:40.149 --> 01:00:44.117
No, I feel blessed.
I feel healthy.

01:00:44.119 --> 01:00:45.118
Yeah?

01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:47.289
Yeah! I've been working out.

01:00:48.157 --> 01:00:49.523
Yeah, right.

01:00:49.525 --> 01:00:51.058
I'm serious. Feel my leg.

01:00:51.060 --> 01:00:52.728
- What?
- Squeeze it.

01:00:53.229 --> 01:00:54.328
Right?

01:00:54.330 --> 01:00:55.495
Sure.

01:00:55.497 --> 01:00:57.900
I can run over a mile now.

01:00:58.567 --> 01:01:00.234
It works.

01:01:00.236 --> 01:01:01.837
It does.

01:01:06.909 --> 01:01:09.011
You know what...
I got a new dog.

01:01:12.414 --> 01:01:14.314
And I saw my daughter.

01:01:14.316 --> 01:01:15.918
Aw, no shit!

01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:18.151
Well, that's good.
That's really great!

01:01:18.153 --> 01:01:20.489
Yeah, it's really good.

01:01:21.090 --> 01:01:23.092
You know what -
you want another?

01:01:24.326 --> 01:01:25.359
Yeah.

01:01:25.361 --> 01:01:26.862
Can we get some more?

01:01:28.163 --> 01:01:29.563
We got something to celebrate.

01:01:29.565 --> 01:01:30.799
Yeah!

01:01:53.355 --> 01:01:55.188
Alright, c'mon. Let's go.

01:01:55.190 --> 01:01:56.523
I wanna take a look...

01:01:56.525 --> 01:01:59.092
Let's go.
No, no, no.

01:01:59.094 --> 01:02:00.894
Let me take you home.
C'mon.

01:02:00.896 --> 01:02:02.898
C'mon. C'mon, c'mon.

01:02:06.001 --> 01:02:07.434
- This way.
- Alright.

01:02:07.436 --> 01:02:09.303
And no way
I'm letting <i>you</i> drive.

01:02:09.305 --> 01:02:10.470
I know it.

01:02:10.472 --> 01:02:13.273
Oh, shit.
Oh, fuck.

01:02:13.275 --> 01:02:15.208
Nah, I'm ok.

01:02:15.210 --> 01:02:16.143
Alright.

01:02:16.145 --> 01:02:18.278
I love you. Do you know that?

01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:19.515
Yeah, I know that.

01:02:57.587 --> 01:02:58.518
Drink it.

01:02:58.520 --> 01:02:59.521
Hi.

01:03:09.599 --> 01:03:11.467
Do you wanna stay here tonight?

01:03:13.335 --> 01:03:15.537
No, I'm gonna
sleep on the couch.

01:03:19.709 --> 01:03:21.510
I won't do anything.

01:03:22.978 --> 01:03:24.077
I bet.

01:03:37.025 --> 01:03:40.229
God! <i>Please</i> stay
in here with me.

01:03:47.737 --> 01:03:49.606
- Scoot over.
- Yay!

01:05:48.257 --> 01:05:50.423
Noooo!

01:05:50.425 --> 01:05:53.794
Yes! Time to wake up!

01:05:53.796 --> 01:05:56.263
- No!
- Wake up.

01:05:56.265 --> 01:05:58.534
- Wake up.
- Why?

01:06:00.737 --> 01:06:02.837
So mean.

01:06:02.839 --> 01:06:04.506
Wake up.

01:06:48.585 --> 01:06:50.285
- Good mornin'.
- Mornin'.

01:06:51.721 --> 01:06:53.253
What time is it?

01:06:53.255 --> 01:06:54.755
It's 4:30.

01:06:54.757 --> 01:06:56.391
Oh, holy shit.

01:06:57.627 --> 01:06:59.660
I'm sorry I got so shitfaced.

01:06:59.662 --> 01:07:02.331
Ah, it's alright.
It happens to the best of us.

01:07:03.365 --> 01:07:04.431
Sugar?

01:07:04.433 --> 01:07:05.467
No.

01:07:06.803 --> 01:07:09.937
Yeah, I need to
get you back to your truck.

01:07:09.939 --> 01:07:11.808
Oh, fuck that's right.

01:07:13.308 --> 01:07:14.343
Ok.

01:07:37.667 --> 01:07:38.933
Feel alright?

01:07:38.935 --> 01:07:40.302
Yeah.

01:07:59.722 --> 01:08:01.891
Oh, my god.
Oh, my -

01:08:10.432 --> 01:08:11.834
Here. I'm so sorry.

01:08:12.035 --> 01:08:13.803
I am so sorry.

01:08:34.691 --> 01:08:36.791
Slow down, slow down...

01:08:36.792 --> 01:08:37.694
Slow down.

01:08:40.362 --> 01:08:44.299
Aw, I know. I know.
Shhhh.

01:09:18.634 --> 01:09:20.368
This is so cool!

01:09:27.442 --> 01:09:28.978
That feels so good.

01:09:40.555 --> 01:09:42.290
That was amazing!

01:09:44.093 --> 01:09:45.260
Thank you!

01:09:48.765 --> 01:09:50.663
Hey, do you wanna
get out of here?

01:09:50.666 --> 01:09:53.603
Go find something to eat?
I can pay for myself.

01:09:54.402 --> 01:09:59.809
Um, I'm just gonna stay here
for a bit and take a nap.

01:10:02.078 --> 01:10:02.945
Ok.

01:10:11.553 --> 01:10:13.022
I can tuck you in.

01:10:16.692 --> 01:10:18.594
Make you into a burrito.

01:12:12.540 --> 01:12:14.174
Thanks for coming to get me.

01:12:14.176 --> 01:12:15.510
You're welcome.

01:12:28.691 --> 01:12:31.526
So, where am I taking you?
Back to school?

01:12:33.963 --> 01:12:35.765
Can I talk to you
about something?

01:12:41.170 --> 01:12:47.176
Last night I was with this girl,
and it was so great...

01:12:49.111 --> 01:12:50.543
And then the next day

01:12:50.545 --> 01:12:52.447
all I could think about
was Jules.

01:12:53.182 --> 01:12:55.115
And it makes me
really sad because,

01:12:55.117 --> 01:12:58.052
as much as I love Jules,

01:12:58.054 --> 01:13:00.154
we never had a night like that

01:13:00.156 --> 01:13:02.091
and I don't really
know what to think.

01:13:10.599 --> 01:13:13.233
Well, I'll tell you what...

01:13:13.235 --> 01:13:16.070
The sun's gonna be up
in about 20 minutes.

01:13:16.072 --> 01:13:18.172
Why don't I just
take you to my house?

01:13:18.174 --> 01:13:20.908
You can meet my dog,
I'll make you breakfast.

01:13:20.910 --> 01:13:22.176
And I gotta go to work;

01:13:22.178 --> 01:13:24.278
you can have
the whole place to yourself.

01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:29.185
And figure out, you know,
what your next move is.

01:13:32.655 --> 01:13:34.223
That's really nice. Thank you.

01:13:36.625 --> 01:13:37.793
You're welcome.

01:14:13.829 --> 01:14:14.964
Hey, c'mon in.

01:14:16.999 --> 01:14:18.165
That's my dog Towns.

01:14:18.167 --> 01:14:19.769
Oh, my goodness.

01:14:20.870 --> 01:14:21.670
Hi.

01:14:22.171 --> 01:14:25.908
He's been feeling pretty bad.
He was kinda sick the other day.

01:14:26.609 --> 01:14:28.942
Hey. Hey, there.

01:14:28.944 --> 01:14:30.980
He's definitely
doing better, though.

01:14:38.954 --> 01:14:40.222
What's her name?

01:14:41.157 --> 01:14:42.258
Who?

01:14:42.658 --> 01:14:44.925
- Your ex-wife.
- Oh.

01:14:44.927 --> 01:14:46.662
Emily.

01:14:53.102 --> 01:14:55.202
We don't have to talk about it
if you don't want to.

01:14:55.204 --> 01:14:56.906
No, it's ok.

01:15:01.944 --> 01:15:04.013
That was the worst time
of my life.

01:15:07.016 --> 01:15:11.720
That's the closest I've
ever been to being suicidal.

01:15:13.823 --> 01:15:16.690
I loved her, and I loved them.

01:15:16.692 --> 01:15:19.829
I just didn't love us,
if that makes any sense.

01:15:28.804 --> 01:15:30.304
Did you get a divorce?

01:15:30.306 --> 01:15:32.172
No.

01:15:32.174 --> 01:15:34.210
We're still married.
She's still my wife.

01:15:41.283 --> 01:15:43.183
The kids don't give a shit
about money.

01:15:43.185 --> 01:15:46.021
I could've been broke,
I could've been a drunk.

01:15:48.457 --> 01:15:50.826
But ignoring them
was unforgivable.

01:15:59.401 --> 01:16:01.070
You're working on that, though.

01:16:03.005 --> 01:16:04.240
I guess, kind of.

01:16:05.141 --> 01:16:07.441
I went and saw my daughter

01:16:07.443 --> 01:16:11.080
and I tried to give her money,
and she wouldn't take that.

01:16:11.981 --> 01:16:14.181
I asked her
about her brother, Marco;

01:16:14.183 --> 01:16:16.385
she wouldn't tell me
anything about him.

01:16:18.354 --> 01:16:20.856
She wouldn't even
let me see my grandkids.

01:16:23.993 --> 01:16:26.195
I really fucked my life up.

01:16:28.998 --> 01:16:31.000
I really fucked their lives up.

01:16:45.748 --> 01:16:46.849
Aw, Towns.

01:16:48.851 --> 01:16:50.319
Tired, tired man.

01:16:51.253 --> 01:16:53.322
He likes you, though.

01:17:03.933 --> 01:17:05.332
<i>For true equality,</i>

01:17:05.334 --> 01:17:07.768
we need to add big G,

01:17:07.770 --> 01:17:10.337
the universal
gravitational constant.

01:17:10.339 --> 01:17:13.307
This is just a number,
a constant of the universe,

01:17:13.309 --> 01:17:17.179
which tells us how strong
the gravitational force is...

01:17:31.794 --> 01:17:32.828
You ready?

01:17:44.473 --> 01:17:47.307
I hate coming here because
we never actually talk.

01:17:47.309 --> 01:17:49.309
We just sit here and eat.

01:17:49.311 --> 01:17:51.378
Isn't that the point?

01:17:51.380 --> 01:17:52.848
You know what I mean.

01:17:58.187 --> 01:17:59.955
Have you talked to David lately?

01:18:01.857 --> 01:18:03.557
He's actually DJ-ing this, like,

01:18:03.559 --> 01:18:05.828
corporate,
private party thing tonight.

01:18:06.996 --> 01:18:08.228
That sounds horrible.

01:18:08.230 --> 01:18:09.498
Yeah, I know.

01:18:12.401 --> 01:18:14.403
He told me about you guys.

01:18:18.874 --> 01:18:22.009
Yeah. I don't really
wanna talk about it.

01:18:22.011 --> 01:18:23.812
Ok.

01:18:26.215 --> 01:18:28.515
I need to call my mom
so she can pick me up,

01:18:28.517 --> 01:18:30.517
so I can go
meet up with David.

01:18:30.519 --> 01:18:32.286
It's ok, I can take you.

01:18:32.288 --> 01:18:33.889
- Are you sure?
- Uh-huh.

01:18:36.025 --> 01:18:38.091
You should come in
and say hey,

01:18:38.093 --> 01:18:39.359
hang out for a bit.

01:18:39.361 --> 01:18:41.094
Yeah, I'll say hi to him.

01:18:41.096 --> 01:18:42.231
It could be fun.

01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:44.965
Ok.

01:18:44.967 --> 01:18:46.402
Do you think
they'll let us in?

01:18:55.978 --> 01:18:58.145
- Hey.
- What are you guys doing here?

01:18:58.147 --> 01:19:00.049
We're your plus-ones.

01:19:01.450 --> 01:19:03.052
This is so lame.

01:19:04.119 --> 01:19:05.154
Yeah.

01:19:05.854 --> 01:19:07.389
Well, it's good to see you guys.

01:19:08.490 --> 01:19:10.326
Remember that mix
I told you about?

01:19:12.361 --> 01:19:13.362
Which one?

01:19:17.933 --> 01:19:21.001
This one...
Tell me if you like it.

01:19:57.206 --> 01:19:58.407
I love you.
