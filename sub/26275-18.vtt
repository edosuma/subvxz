00:03.090 --> 00:05.309
[groans]:
Ah, come on.

00:05.353 --> 00:06.919
The other machine was better.

00:06.963 --> 00:10.271
It's not that complicated.

00:10.314 --> 00:11.533
ED:
We... we've been...

00:17.887 --> 00:19.280
-I told you that.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:19.323 --> 00:20.629
[Chuck sighs]

00:20.672 --> 00:23.284
Ed, uh, Carol has to work
this weekend,

00:23.327 --> 00:25.112
so I can go with you
to that funeral.

00:25.155 --> 00:26.287
Thanks, Chuck. Thanks.

00:26.330 --> 00:28.115
Yeah, VFW pal.

00:28.158 --> 00:31.248
Cholesterol finished the job
the Viet Cong couldn't.

00:32.902 --> 00:35.426
And so I can't use
my Nuggets tickets,

00:35.470 --> 00:37.646
so, uh, do you want them?

00:37.689 --> 00:39.952
No, no, thanks. Doinga little ice fishing by myself.

00:39.996 --> 00:41.650
Just me sitting
on a cold bucket,

00:41.693 --> 00:44.218
-freezing mynuggets.
-Ah.

00:44.261 --> 00:47.308
[chuckles]
Hey, the lengths you'll go to

00:47.351 --> 00:49.310
to find a sport
white people are better at.

00:50.702 --> 00:51.660
[knocking]

00:51.703 --> 00:53.096
Good morning, gentlemen.

00:53.140 --> 00:54.315
-Reverend.
-Hey.

00:54.358 --> 00:55.533
Clean up the language, boys.

00:55.577 --> 00:57.927
We got a backward collar
in the room.

00:57.970 --> 01:00.886
[chuckles] Hey, uh, how abouta cup of coffee, Reverend Paul?

01:00.930 --> 01:02.758
You know everybody
always offers me coffee?

01:02.801 --> 01:05.891
It's never, "Hey, how about
a beer, Reverend Paul?"

01:05.935 --> 01:07.893
We don't have booze at work--

01:07.937 --> 01:10.113
this isn't the church.

01:10.157 --> 01:11.941
[all laugh]

01:11.984 --> 01:14.900
Listen, I'm in a bit of a rush.You got some time, Mike?

01:14.944 --> 01:18.121
Only the man upstairs knows
if I got more time, but...

01:18.165 --> 01:20.602
Uh, wait.

01:21.733 --> 01:23.213
Unless you've heard something.

01:26.303 --> 01:28.523
-So, what's up?
-Uh, listen,

01:28.566 --> 01:30.307
I am gonna need you to teach

01:30.351 --> 01:33.484
the adult Sunday school class
this weekend.

01:33.528 --> 01:35.704
You came all the way over here
to ask me that?

01:35.747 --> 01:38.576
Why didn't you shoot me
an e-mail or just shoot me?

01:39.969 --> 01:42.319
I find it harder
for people to say no

01:42.363 --> 01:44.104
when they have
to look me in the eye.

01:46.410 --> 01:47.977
No.

01:50.545 --> 01:52.329
Not that hard.

01:52.373 --> 01:56.203
Mike, you signed up to be the
backup Sunday school teacher.

01:56.246 --> 01:58.944
No, no, no, no. I signed upto be the backup to the backup.

01:58.988 --> 02:00.946
I'm, like, third
on the depth chart.

02:00.990 --> 02:03.297
Well, first- and second-string
are out of town,

02:03.340 --> 02:05.821
-so grab your helmet,
I'm putting you in.
-[laughs]

02:05.864 --> 02:08.563
Oh, you know,
I really can't this Sunday.

02:08.606 --> 02:10.173
[sighs]

02:10.217 --> 02:13.220
A close friend of Ed's
passed away.

02:14.656 --> 02:17.224
And I'm going ice fishing.

02:19.356 --> 02:21.402
You know, here's something
I rarely get to say

02:21.445 --> 02:22.968
as a pastor, Mike.

02:23.012 --> 02:24.448
I don't care.

02:26.494 --> 02:27.799
I'll see you Sunday.

02:29.018 --> 02:31.020
♪

02:35.807 --> 02:37.809
-Mmm.
-Hey.

02:37.853 --> 02:39.985
-Hi.
-[laughs]

02:40.029 --> 02:43.859
Boy... that smells
almost as good as you look.

02:43.902 --> 02:45.339
Aw.
[laughs]

02:45.382 --> 02:47.471
Well, it's beef stew,

02:47.515 --> 02:49.343
and if you don't think
it's stew-pendous,

02:49.386 --> 02:52.476
I won't carrot all.
[laughs]

02:54.086 --> 02:56.611
Oh, peas, honey.

02:58.395 --> 03:01.833
Ah. You're joining in.
[chuckles]

03:01.877 --> 03:03.270
-What do you want?
-Look.

03:05.054 --> 03:07.404
You like to teach,
you love God-- how about

03:07.448 --> 03:09.232
-I ask you...
-Nope.

03:09.276 --> 03:10.364
No, let me finish.
Just, I want you...

03:10.407 --> 03:12.322
Nope.

03:12.366 --> 03:15.282
You volunteered to be the
substitute for the substitute.

03:15.325 --> 03:17.327
Which would mean
I would never have to do this.

03:18.720 --> 03:20.591
Wait a minute.
Look who's home.

03:20.635 --> 03:22.680
I almost forgot. My favorite
daughter, right here.

03:22.724 --> 03:25.596
And yet you forgot I was home.

03:25.640 --> 03:27.598
He's buttering you up
before he asks you

03:27.642 --> 03:29.513
to teach Sunday school for him.

03:29.557 --> 03:30.253
Nope.

03:30.297 --> 03:32.299
Come on. [stammers]
I'm just gonna ask

03:32.342 --> 03:33.430
this one little favor.

03:33.474 --> 03:36.520
Nope. I came home
to hang out with my sisters.

03:36.564 --> 03:38.305
It's okay, Mike,
the fishing shack

03:38.348 --> 03:41.351
will still be brutally cold
and lonely next week.

03:42.526 --> 03:44.876
Haven't we always taught you
to help unto others?

03:44.920 --> 03:47.270
Says the man
who's trying to ditch church

03:47.314 --> 03:49.707
to go unto ice fishing.

03:49.751 --> 03:51.361
If you need someone,

03:51.405 --> 03:53.494
I hear Kyle is
a great Sunday school teacher.

03:53.537 --> 03:55.452
Uh, no, no.
This is teaching adults.

03:55.496 --> 03:57.367
Kyle's only taught
the children's class.

03:57.411 --> 03:58.847
But adults are just children...

03:58.890 --> 04:01.893
with more money
and less cartilage.

04:01.937 --> 04:05.332
Well, good luck
tricking him into doing it.

04:05.375 --> 04:07.116
Just kidding.
It will be very easy

04:07.159 --> 04:08.944
tricking Kyle into doing it.

04:11.947 --> 04:13.427
Ah, what's it gonna be,
ladies, huh--

04:13.470 --> 04:15.429
Sandra Bullock,
uh, lost in space

04:15.472 --> 04:18.388
or Sandra Bullock,
necklace thief, hmm?

04:18.432 --> 04:19.650
I vote the astronaut.

04:19.694 --> 04:22.871
Unless you have that
out-of-control-bus one.

04:22.914 --> 04:25.134
No, the astronaut one is lame.

04:25.177 --> 04:27.528
-One outfit for an entire movie?
-[chuckles]

04:27.571 --> 04:30.139
-No, thanks.
-Uh, I vote necklace, too.

04:30.182 --> 04:31.923
Sorry. Majority rules.

04:31.967 --> 04:33.882
Wait. Doesn't Jen get to vote?

04:33.925 --> 04:36.145
She can't vote.
She's not a citizen.

04:37.146 --> 04:38.321
Here you go, Mandy.

04:38.365 --> 04:39.496
You're the best, mèimei.

04:39.540 --> 04:41.759
That means "little sister"
in Mandarin.

04:41.803 --> 04:45.110
Sort of.

04:45.154 --> 04:47.199
You have to try this, Kris.
It's Jen's special lemonade.

04:47.243 --> 04:48.462
Ooh, ooh.
Jen, do you mind?

04:48.505 --> 04:50.333
-Not at all.
-Oh, and can you be a doll

04:50.377 --> 04:52.335
and make that popcorn
with the brown sugar butter?

04:52.379 --> 04:55.120
Oh, I'm so happy I'm here.

04:55.164 --> 04:58.994
We don't have dairy or sugar inRyan's House of Vegan Delights.

05:00.038 --> 05:01.779
Popcorn coming right up.

05:01.823 --> 05:03.433
Eve, would you like something?

05:03.477 --> 05:05.000
Oh. No, Jen.

05:05.043 --> 05:08.003
If I want something,
I can get it myself.

05:16.794 --> 05:19.144
Hey, Kyle.
Thought we were having lunch.

05:19.188 --> 05:20.798
Oh. I can't.

05:20.842 --> 05:23.932
I'm preparing Mr. B'sSunday school lesson for class.

05:23.975 --> 05:27.936
I'm at "staring
at a blank page" part.

05:27.979 --> 05:30.242
Uh... well, what's the big deal?

05:30.286 --> 05:32.593
You taught Boyd's class.
He said it was really fun.

05:32.636 --> 05:35.944
He loves your puppet
of John the Bath Towel.

05:35.987 --> 05:38.729
Yeah, but I-I'm not teaching
kids, I'm teaching adults,

05:38.773 --> 05:41.645
which means no puppets,
no balloon animals, and...

05:41.689 --> 05:43.560
I got nothin'.

05:43.604 --> 05:46.607
Well, why don't you just use
something that adults like?

05:46.650 --> 05:47.782
Okay.

05:47.825 --> 05:50.437
Uh, adults like
charts and graphs, right?

05:51.568 --> 05:52.874
No.

05:54.658 --> 05:56.225
But they do like
to be entertained.

05:56.268 --> 05:59.968
You know, what you need...
is accompaniment.

06:00.011 --> 06:02.274
You mean, like, fries?

06:04.581 --> 06:06.061
No.

06:06.104 --> 06:08.585
Like, okay,
when I was in college,

06:08.629 --> 06:10.631
I used to do
this morning radio show,

06:10.674 --> 06:12.415
RyRy and The Crusher.

06:12.459 --> 06:14.417
I was-I was RyRy.

06:14.461 --> 06:16.550
And The Crusher--
he was a big fella--

06:16.593 --> 06:19.770
would do the news,
and I would riff off him,

06:19.814 --> 06:22.425
painting this awesome soundscapewith my keyboard.

06:22.469 --> 06:24.558
Like, what are you teaching?

06:24.601 --> 06:25.602
Uh, Noah's ark.

06:25.646 --> 06:28.431
Perfect. Imagine this.

06:28.475 --> 06:29.824
You're talking
about the great flood.

06:29.867 --> 06:31.608
What if you could hear
the storm?

06:31.652 --> 06:33.436
[imitates rain]

06:33.480 --> 06:35.612
And then suddenly, crack!
A bolt of lightning.

06:35.656 --> 06:37.527
-Whoa!
-Oh, yeah.

06:37.571 --> 06:40.225
That, my friend,
is the power of accompaniment,

06:40.269 --> 06:42.489
and that is
what I bring to the table.

06:42.532 --> 06:44.012
Yeah, that'd be fantastic.

06:44.055 --> 06:46.275
-You'd do that for me?
-Yeah, of course.

06:46.318 --> 06:49.017
You helped me break up theconcrete slab behind the garage.

06:49.060 --> 06:50.322
No, I didn't.

06:50.366 --> 06:51.628
Oh, that's right.

06:51.672 --> 06:53.413
You will Monday.

07:01.595 --> 07:03.031
-[indistinct chatter]
-Okay.

07:03.074 --> 07:05.599
If everyone wants
to find a seat?

07:05.642 --> 07:07.470
Let's be quiet foxes.

07:07.514 --> 07:10.734
Uh, where are my quiet foxes?

07:14.695 --> 07:16.653
[electronic chiming]

07:19.134 --> 07:20.875
Good morning, everybody.

07:20.918 --> 07:22.485
I'm Kyle.
I get to lead

07:22.529 --> 07:23.834
our discussion today
about Noah's ark.

07:23.878 --> 07:25.880
[sound of people clapping]

07:25.923 --> 07:28.709
Uh, thank you.
And assisting me

07:28.752 --> 07:30.580
is my brother-in-law, Ryan.

07:30.624 --> 07:32.626
[sound of crowd cheering]

07:35.803 --> 07:37.718
Um, everybody knows the story
of Noah's ark,

07:37.761 --> 07:40.634
how God sent a flood
to wash away the sins of man.

07:40.677 --> 07:43.593
-[sound of thunder crashing]
-How it rained for 40 days

07:43.637 --> 07:46.335
-and 40 nights.
-[sound of rain falling]

07:46.378 --> 07:49.773
Noah's ark was adrift
in an endless ocean

07:49.817 --> 07:51.383
among the crashing waves,

07:51.427 --> 07:53.734
the howling wind
and the mighty storms...

07:55.213 --> 07:57.389
...with two of every animal.

07:57.433 --> 07:59.087
-Lambs...
-[sound of lamb baaing]

07:59.130 --> 08:00.305
-horses...
-[sound of horse neighing]

08:00.349 --> 08:01.655
-lions...
-[sound of lion roaring]

08:01.698 --> 08:03.700
[trombone wah-wah'ing sadly]

08:05.397 --> 08:08.096
Uh, that was supposed
to be an elephant.

08:08.139 --> 08:11.621
[clears throat]
But the storm finally stopped,

08:11.665 --> 08:13.667
-and all was quiet.
-[sound of bird squawking]

08:13.710 --> 08:16.104
[sound of donkey braying]

08:16.147 --> 08:17.932
You know, I think
Noah might even say:

08:17.975 --> 08:20.630
"You want to cool it
with the sound effects?"

08:23.154 --> 08:24.808
Maybe the story of...

08:24.852 --> 08:26.506
Noah's ark doesn't need anythingto make it bigger.

08:27.855 --> 08:29.770
Maybe it's too big
already, and...

08:29.813 --> 08:31.598
and that's what's
keeping us from seeing

08:31.641 --> 08:33.600
the small thing
that it's really about.

08:34.601 --> 08:36.603
Starting over.

08:36.646 --> 08:38.387
You know,
the chance to wash away

08:38.430 --> 08:40.345
all the problems and mistakes
in our lives

08:40.389 --> 08:43.784
and set foot on solid ground.

08:43.827 --> 08:46.177
The chance to try again.

08:46.221 --> 08:48.571
Because...
well, it's nice to know

08:48.615 --> 08:50.921
that you can always make
a fresh start.

08:50.965 --> 08:53.445
[sound of elephant trumpeting]

08:53.489 --> 08:55.622
I knew I had an elephant.

09:00.191 --> 09:02.411
Hey, Jen, I've
been meaning to talk to you.

09:02.454 --> 09:04.152
Okay. What's up?

09:04.195 --> 09:06.415
Well, it's
about the other night.

09:06.458 --> 09:08.156
I didn't like what I saw.

09:08.199 --> 09:12.203
Me, neither. Sandra Bullock
is not believable as a thief.

09:13.770 --> 09:17.600
I barely find her believable
as Sandra Bullock.

09:17.644 --> 09:20.864
No, I'm talking about Mandyand Kristin bossing you around.

09:20.908 --> 09:22.736
I don't mind
doing things for them.

09:22.779 --> 09:24.694
They're my big sisters.

09:24.738 --> 09:26.740
[sighs]:
And they got you.

09:26.783 --> 09:28.437
That's how they got me, too.

09:28.480 --> 09:30.744
They know how much
you want them to like you.

09:30.787 --> 09:32.615
I don't think they do know.

09:32.659 --> 09:35.400
Because I want them
to like me a lot.

09:35.444 --> 09:37.272
Here's what they don't tell you.

09:37.315 --> 09:40.754
Left unchecked,
older sisters are monsters.

09:40.797 --> 09:43.974
And by that I mean
they're horrible people.

09:44.018 --> 09:45.802
[sniffing]

09:45.846 --> 09:47.804
Did you make cookies?

09:47.848 --> 09:49.501
No.

09:49.545 --> 09:51.068
[oven bell dings]

09:59.250 --> 10:00.425
Yes.

10:00.469 --> 10:01.688
For who?

10:02.819 --> 10:04.212
For me...

10:04.255 --> 10:05.648
and you...

10:05.692 --> 10:09.086
[mumbles]:
and maybe Mandy.

10:11.698 --> 10:13.874
You made cookies for Mandy?

10:13.917 --> 10:15.440
-I did.
-[groans]

10:15.484 --> 10:18.226
Jen, Jen, Jen,
you want them to like you,

10:18.269 --> 10:22.709
but it's also important
that they... respect you.

10:22.752 --> 10:25.886
Okay? I-I can show you
how to stand up to them.

10:25.929 --> 10:27.670
But won't that make them mad?

10:27.714 --> 10:29.672
It may, mèimei.

10:33.067 --> 10:34.895
Okay, I'll give it a try,

10:34.938 --> 10:37.941
but I really don't think
they take advantage of me.

10:37.985 --> 10:39.682
[dryer buzzes]

10:46.733 --> 10:49.039
Whose laundry are you doing?

10:49.083 --> 10:51.041
Mine...

10:51.085 --> 10:52.695
and...

10:52.739 --> 10:54.915
[high-pitched]:
maybe Mandy's.

10:54.958 --> 10:56.394
Oh, my God, come on!

11:03.097 --> 11:04.838
Hey. Before you get mad at me

11:04.881 --> 11:06.927
for having Kyle
substitute teach for me,

11:06.970 --> 11:09.843
brought you some rainbow trout.

11:09.886 --> 11:14.369
So you think you can buy me offwith a few fish?

11:14.412 --> 11:16.937
[scoffs]
Absolutely not.

11:16.980 --> 11:20.418
There's also a nice bottle
of wine in there.

11:21.550 --> 11:23.857
Well, bless you, my son.

11:25.032 --> 11:26.816
-Good deal.
-Hey, listen,

11:26.860 --> 11:28.296
and as far as
Kyle's teaching goes?

11:28.339 --> 11:30.298
-Yeah?
-It was fantastic.

11:30.341 --> 11:31.952
Well, of course it was.

11:31.995 --> 11:35.564
That was whyhe was my first and only choice.

11:35.607 --> 11:37.348
-He was amazing.
-Great.

11:37.392 --> 11:40.177
That young man has a way
of peeling back

11:40.221 --> 11:41.962
all the unnecessary layers
of religion

11:42.005 --> 11:43.528
-and just speaks simply.
-He...

11:43.572 --> 11:46.793
he has no problem
speaking simply.

11:47.794 --> 11:49.534
Well, and that's a quality

11:49.578 --> 11:51.014
that you and the congregation

11:51.058 --> 11:52.407
should look for
in your next pastor.

11:52.450 --> 11:54.322
Well, I hope
that's a long time coming.

11:54.365 --> 11:55.715
Well, it's actually gonna be
a short time.

11:57.238 --> 11:58.979
I'm leaving the church.

11:59.022 --> 12:00.154
Jesus...

12:00.197 --> 12:02.591
our Lord and Savior

12:02.634 --> 12:05.637
would hate to hear that.

12:12.035 --> 12:13.776
You're leaving the church?
How do you even do that?

12:13.820 --> 12:17.998
I thought this, you know,
was like working for the mob.

12:18.041 --> 12:21.001
-Mike, in Ecclesiastes three,
verse one,
-Mm-hmm.

12:21.044 --> 12:23.786
it says "To every thing
there is a season,

12:23.830 --> 12:27.572
and a time to every purpose
under the heaven."

12:27.616 --> 12:30.401
Actually,
that's a song by The Byrds.

12:31.925 --> 12:33.796
Mike, I'm just feeling
a little burned out.

12:33.840 --> 12:36.843
Every day my assistant
gives me a task list.

12:36.886 --> 12:38.975
Listen to this.
"Building fund meeting.

12:39.019 --> 12:40.803
"Budget reconciliation reports.

12:40.847 --> 12:42.370
-Staff reviews."
-Yeah.

12:42.413 --> 12:44.241
I get it, I get it. I literallyget this all the time.

12:44.285 --> 12:45.895
You know how I dealt with that?

12:45.939 --> 12:48.637
I fired my assistant.

12:49.638 --> 12:51.640
Once a week
for about a half hour,

12:51.683 --> 12:53.033
I get to preach.

12:53.076 --> 12:55.035
And I love that.

12:55.078 --> 12:57.907
And then it's back to this.

12:57.951 --> 12:59.213
Get away from this.
You know, clear your head.

12:59.256 --> 13:00.954
Do something else for a while.

13:00.997 --> 13:02.956
I've been praying on this
for a while,

13:02.999 --> 13:05.872
and I told God
that I was at a crossroads

13:05.915 --> 13:08.483
-and I needed some guidance.
-[sighs]

13:08.526 --> 13:11.616
And after watching Kyle...

13:11.660 --> 13:15.533
it was like God saying,
"Here's your sign."

13:20.538 --> 13:21.975
Wow.

13:22.018 --> 13:25.065
So you think God used Kyle

13:25.108 --> 13:26.675
to deliver you a sign.

13:27.937 --> 13:30.853
I don't use Kyle
to deliver my lunch.

13:30.897 --> 13:33.638
Mike, we're friends.

13:33.682 --> 13:37.120
Trust me.This is the right thing for me.

13:38.252 --> 13:40.080
-You're a good man, Reverend.
-Thank you.

13:40.123 --> 13:42.082
And a great preacher.

13:42.125 --> 13:44.040
Enjoy the fish.

13:44.084 --> 13:46.086
If you run low on 'em...

13:46.129 --> 13:47.827
I think you know what to do.

13:52.092 --> 13:54.007
Hey, let's get this thing going.

13:54.050 --> 13:55.704
Tonight we have

13:55.747 --> 13:58.098
Julia Roberts as a prostitute

13:58.141 --> 14:00.927
or Julia Roberts is dying.

14:01.971 --> 14:04.234
This one says Toy Story 4,

14:04.278 --> 14:06.933
but I don't know howDad would have that one already.

14:10.023 --> 14:12.503
I think we should just let Jen
pick the movie.

14:12.547 --> 14:15.811
She's not a citizen.
She can't pick.

14:16.943 --> 14:17.900
Jen, do you want to watch

14:17.944 --> 14:20.511
Julia Roberts working girl
or dying girl?

14:20.555 --> 14:22.122
Hmm.

14:22.165 --> 14:24.124
I want to play cards.

14:24.167 --> 14:26.169
But it's movie night.

14:26.213 --> 14:28.563
Why, because you said so?

14:29.607 --> 14:32.088
Mèimeiwith the smack, smack.

14:34.090 --> 14:35.918
Okay, fine. Cards, then.

14:35.962 --> 14:37.789
Can I at least
get something to drink?

14:37.833 --> 14:39.052
That looks good. What is it?

14:39.095 --> 14:41.924
Oh, it's a drink from Hong Kongcalled "none-yo."

14:41.968 --> 14:43.883
None yo business.

14:47.190 --> 14:48.496
Wh-What's going on?

14:48.539 --> 14:49.845
You're going on.

14:50.977 --> 14:53.283
That makes no sense.

14:53.327 --> 14:55.198
I know.
I'm lousy at this.

14:55.242 --> 14:57.200
It takes practice.

14:57.244 --> 14:59.333
Hate is a skill.

14:59.376 --> 15:00.943
What are you telling her?

15:00.987 --> 15:02.597
-You are such a troublemaker.
-Oh, yeah?

15:02.640 --> 15:04.164
What are you gonna do about it?

15:04.207 --> 15:06.079
[blows raspberry]

15:06.122 --> 15:08.081
Nothing.

15:08.124 --> 15:10.997
See?
Folds like a lawn chair.

15:12.128 --> 15:14.609
Jen, I don't know what
she told you about us, but...

15:14.652 --> 15:17.003
She called you monsters
and horrible people.

15:18.221 --> 15:20.832
And that is why
Mom and Dad had her sent away.

15:20.876 --> 15:22.747
You know, she's just bitter

15:22.791 --> 15:25.054
because you've replaced her
in our hearts.

15:25.098 --> 15:28.971
You don't have a heart.
You just have emojis.

15:29.015 --> 15:30.364
Eve, in my culture,

15:30.407 --> 15:33.106
we're taught to honor age
as a sign of wisdom.

15:33.149 --> 15:36.239
I like doing things
for my elders.

15:36.283 --> 15:37.980
-Huh?
-Your what, now?

15:40.243 --> 15:44.204
No matter how infirm or frail,
they're still people.

15:44.247 --> 15:45.988
So, I'll go get the ice cream

15:46.032 --> 15:48.991
and the blanket for the old onesin case they get a chill.

15:49.035 --> 15:50.384
-Like hell you will.
-No, no.

15:50.427 --> 15:52.647
Mandy, she's just playing
to your ego.

15:52.690 --> 15:54.344
I know.
And it's working.

15:54.388 --> 15:56.129
I'll get my own damn ice cream.

15:56.172 --> 15:58.348
I am gonna help her,

15:58.392 --> 16:00.960
because I am not crazy
about this.

16:03.266 --> 16:05.790
Well, on behalf
of little sisters everywhere,

16:05.834 --> 16:07.401
welcome to the club.

16:09.316 --> 16:10.882
Thank you.

16:10.926 --> 16:12.580
What are you drinking, anyway?

16:12.623 --> 16:15.452
"Yaint." Yaint getting any.

16:24.418 --> 16:26.159
[exhales]

16:27.638 --> 16:30.685
Wow. Mike.

16:30.728 --> 16:33.818
This is just... grim.

16:33.862 --> 16:36.082
Well, my concept
for building houses

16:36.125 --> 16:39.389
on-on the ice
is don't make them too fancy.

16:39.433 --> 16:43.045
There was this guy up here lastyear who really went all-out.

16:43.089 --> 16:45.265
Two stories, furniture,
wood-burning stove.

16:45.308 --> 16:47.136
-It was incredible.
-[chuckles]: So incredible

16:47.180 --> 16:49.138
he forgot
that he built it on ice,

16:49.182 --> 16:50.618
so when spring came...

16:50.661 --> 16:53.229
God rest his soul, man.

16:53.273 --> 16:55.492
Well, I appreciate the invite.

16:55.536 --> 16:59.061
I'm gonna need some hobbies
once I retire.

16:59.105 --> 17:01.194
Maybe shivering
will be a fun one.

17:01.237 --> 17:03.196
[chuckles] Listen,
get all the gear ready to go.

17:03.239 --> 17:04.849
I'm gonna head back
to the truck,

17:04.893 --> 17:06.416
get the rest of our gear,
and by "rest of it,"

17:06.460 --> 17:09.115
I mean booze.
And better socks.

17:10.507 --> 17:11.682
So...

17:11.726 --> 17:13.641
you're really gonna retire?

17:13.684 --> 17:14.903
Yeah.

17:14.946 --> 17:18.167
I think I'm just
getting a little stale.

17:18.211 --> 17:20.343
But you have the best job
in the world, sir.

17:20.387 --> 17:22.258
Well, testing out bounce houses

17:22.302 --> 17:25.305
is probably thebest job
in the world.

17:25.348 --> 17:28.090
Kyle, you don't have
to keep calling me sir.

17:28.134 --> 17:31.224
And I just think I'm getting
a little old for this.

17:31.267 --> 17:33.878
Moses was 120.

17:33.922 --> 17:34.966
Yeah, you're right.

17:35.010 --> 17:36.316
And Noah, he was 950.

17:36.359 --> 17:38.187
And he built a big boat.

17:38.231 --> 17:40.320
I'm in my 20s,
and I've been working

17:40.363 --> 17:43.105
on the same jigsaw puzzle
since middle school.

17:43.149 --> 17:46.195
Well, the ministry needs
a young person's energy.

17:46.239 --> 17:47.283
I realized that

17:47.327 --> 17:49.546
when I was watching
your Sunday school message.

17:49.590 --> 17:51.679
Not so sure
everyone got my message.

17:51.722 --> 17:53.246
What? You were excellent.

17:53.289 --> 17:56.379
Who in that room
didn't get your message?

17:56.423 --> 17:57.511
You.

17:59.426 --> 18:01.471
Me?

18:01.515 --> 18:03.212
Yeah, the message
was supposed to be

18:03.256 --> 18:04.692
about how we can all start over.

18:04.735 --> 18:06.563
You know, be renewed.

18:06.607 --> 18:08.174
And you're saying
you can't do that,

18:08.217 --> 18:10.001
so obviously you didn't get it.

18:10.045 --> 18:12.047
Uh, sir.

18:15.050 --> 18:18.314
Where is Mike with that booze?

18:18.358 --> 18:21.926
Kyle, it's different
when the ministry is your job.

18:21.970 --> 18:23.928
'Cause there's
a lot of job stuff

18:23.972 --> 18:26.496
other than just preaching
the word.

18:26.540 --> 18:27.976
Do you know why I like

18:28.019 --> 18:29.543
-coming to Mr. B's fishing hut?-[scoffs]

18:29.586 --> 18:32.328
You hate your fingers and toes?

18:32.372 --> 18:35.288
My job at the store is
to tell people how great it is

18:35.331 --> 18:37.203
to do stuff out in nature.

18:37.246 --> 18:39.248
And if I don't do
that stuff myself,

18:39.292 --> 18:42.599
then what I tell people
might start to feel...

18:42.643 --> 18:44.993
stale.

18:46.995 --> 18:49.432
Are you preaching at me, son?

18:49.476 --> 18:51.304
Just talking.

18:51.347 --> 18:53.175
So, what you're saying

18:53.219 --> 18:56.787
is I should find my own
metaphorical ice fishing hut.

18:56.831 --> 18:58.963
I'm not sure.

18:59.007 --> 19:01.140
Because I have no idea
what that means.

19:02.445 --> 19:04.230
A place where I could go

19:04.273 --> 19:08.103
and remember why I became
a minister in the first place.

19:09.452 --> 19:12.281
A place I could go to renew.

19:12.325 --> 19:14.414
Then, yes.

19:14.457 --> 19:16.416
[chuckles]

19:16.459 --> 19:18.548
You happy now?

19:18.592 --> 19:22.204
Now everybody in that class
got your message.

19:22.248 --> 19:24.293
Well, not RyRy.

19:24.337 --> 19:25.860
But I'll work on him on Monday

19:25.903 --> 19:28.254
when I'm busting up
his concrete.

19:30.256 --> 19:33.868
Kyle, have you ever thought
about going into the ministry?

19:33.911 --> 19:36.653
No. No, never.

19:36.697 --> 19:38.873
Uh, not often.

19:38.916 --> 19:40.570
Sometimes.

19:40.614 --> 19:43.051
It's occurred to me.

19:43.094 --> 19:45.184
I think about it a lot.

19:47.490 --> 19:50.232
Well, you should, son.
You'd be great.

19:50.276 --> 19:53.061
We need people that can deliversimple, powerful messages

19:53.104 --> 19:55.237
like the one you came up with
on Sunday.

19:55.281 --> 19:57.674
[chuckles]
And today.

19:57.718 --> 19:59.372
I'll pray on it.

19:59.415 --> 20:01.330
God will let me know.

20:01.374 --> 20:04.290
-Oh. I got one.
-Hey!

20:04.333 --> 20:06.292
Well, there's your sign.

20:06.335 --> 20:07.858
[both chuckle]

20:14.125 --> 20:15.866
Hey, Mike Baxter here
for Outdoor Man,

20:15.910 --> 20:17.259
talking about passion.

20:17.303 --> 20:19.653
They say if you dosomething you love for a living,

20:19.696 --> 20:21.524
you'll never work a day
in your life.

20:21.568 --> 20:23.831
And no work
is a pretty sweet deal.

20:23.874 --> 20:26.268
You get to feel what it's like
to be a congressman.

20:26.312 --> 20:28.314
[chuckles]

20:30.316 --> 20:32.883
But if you're not careful,turning your passion into a job

20:32.927 --> 20:35.059
could make you fall out of love
with it.

20:35.103 --> 20:38.149
That's why I've rejected offersfrom several prestigious firms

20:38.193 --> 20:40.848
to become a gigolo.

20:40.891 --> 20:42.850
Making your passion
your profession

20:42.893 --> 20:45.069
means it's bound to become work.

20:45.113 --> 20:46.506
Sure, you and your buddies

20:46.549 --> 20:48.159
painting yourselves blue
for Halloween

20:48.203 --> 20:50.553
might have been fun
that first time.

20:50.597 --> 20:52.555
But when you're
coating on the layers

20:52.599 --> 20:54.949
for your 6,000th Blue Man show
in Vegas,

20:54.992 --> 20:58.169
you might regret
chasing that dream.

20:58.213 --> 21:01.129
For me, the outdoors
has always been my sanctuary,

21:01.172 --> 21:02.652
but in my effort to share it
with the world,

21:02.696 --> 21:05.133
I spend a lot of time
chained to a desk.

21:05.176 --> 21:06.874
When I start feeling like
putting my fist

21:06.917 --> 21:08.441
through this computer
I'm talking into,

21:08.484 --> 21:11.400
that's when it's time for me
to head back to nature.

21:11.444 --> 21:14.577
I don't mean driving past naturein a Winnebago

21:14.621 --> 21:17.145
and going, "Is that a tree?"

21:17.188 --> 21:18.451
I need the real thing,

21:18.494 --> 21:20.453
the kind that's so cold
it hurts your face.

21:20.496 --> 21:22.324
That's how you know
you're really in it.

21:22.368 --> 21:23.891
Henry David Thoreau said,

21:23.934 --> 21:26.110
"All nature
is your congratulations,

21:26.154 --> 21:27.721
and you have cause
to bless yourself."

21:27.764 --> 21:30.550
In other words, go outside.

21:30.593 --> 21:32.291
Hope I don't see you out there.

21:34.597 --> 21:36.295
[shivers] Baxter out.

21:37.948 --> 21:39.559
[chicken clucks]

21:39.602 --> 21:41.300
