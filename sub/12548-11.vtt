WEBVTT

00:00.557 --> 00:01.793
I'm Zheng Li, special envoy

00:01.908 --> 00:03.389
from the people's Republic of China.

00:03.503 --> 00:05.212
As an ally, we are very powerful.

00:05.352 --> 00:06.670
An alliance, Sir?

00:06.814 --> 00:08.498
This administration will starve us out.

00:08.639 --> 00:10.425
You'll have your supplies in 48 hours.

00:10.594 --> 00:11.977
This is what the White House

00:12.086 --> 00:13.544
doesn't want anyone else to see.

00:13.655 --> 00:15.907
There are powerful people
organizing a coup d'etat.

00:16.064 --> 00:17.061
They've taken her somewhere,

00:17.182 --> 00:18.245
and I'm gonna find her.

00:18.372 --> 00:20.833
Sam.

00:20.957 --> 00:22.274
If you're with me, you're not safe.

00:22.378 --> 00:24.106
- I don't care.
- Yeah, I know. I do.

00:24.279 --> 00:25.705
Wait. Sam!

00:31.360 --> 00:32.567
Christine!

What's your status, Lieutenant?

01:04.095 --> 01:05.665
King has completed the weld repairs.

01:05.773 --> 01:07.196
First repair test positive.

01:07.293 --> 01:09.066
We're about to conduct
the deep dive test.

01:09.169 --> 01:10.953
It'll have to wait.
I need you back in port asap.

01:11.269 --> 01:12.252
Sir?

01:12.399 --> 01:13.514
The Chinese supply ship is headed

01:13.641 --> 01:14.915
towards us unescorted.

01:15.035 --> 01:16.809
The US has sent a destroyer
to intercept.

01:16.914 --> 01:18.211
They're not gonna let her
reach our shores.

01:18.382 --> 01:20.217
Also, there's a storm bearing down.

01:20.349 --> 01:21.987
Winds approaching typhoon strength.

01:22.118 --> 01:23.844
The situation on the island
has grown critical.

01:23.943 --> 01:25.470
We need that supply ship
to make it through.

01:25.661 --> 01:28.150
I need you in before it hits so
I can take command of the boat.

01:29.153 --> 01:30.084
Aye aye, Sir.

01:30.186 --> 01:32.775
Alert the crew. This will be
a combat patrol mission.

01:33.055 --> 01:34.179
All ahead flank, Lieutenant.

01:34.422 --> 01:36.936
Ahead flank, aye.
Colorado out.

01:46.705 --> 01:48.643
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:48.812 --> 01:50.278
I thought I might find you here.

01:50.465 --> 01:51.753
Yeah.

01:55.892 --> 01:58.341
Sam, I'm very sorry for your wife.

01:59.370 --> 02:01.208
If I can do anything...

02:03.248 --> 02:05.004
I don't know what to say.

02:09.368 --> 02:10.606
What is it?

02:13.222 --> 02:14.955
Who do you think you are to me?

02:15.392 --> 02:17.217
I'm trying to be your friend.

02:20.676 --> 02:22.447
You want to be friends?

02:23.219 --> 02:24.346
What do you think we should do, friend?

02:24.457 --> 02:25.610
You want-- you want to--
you want to--

02:25.713 --> 02:26.571
you want to jump in the sack?

02:26.685 --> 02:28.033
You want to screw the pain away?

02:28.137 --> 02:29.626
Is that what you want to do?

02:30.596 --> 02:32.671
Okay. Uh, I understand.

02:33.842 --> 02:36.024
I think there is a bit more
between us than that.

02:36.135 --> 02:37.190
Let's just be honest right now,

02:37.301 --> 02:38.560
'cause that's all I can deal with.

02:38.728 --> 02:40.430
We're not friends.

02:41.749 --> 02:42.962
Even right here, right now,

02:43.104 --> 02:44.630
what's going on between us,

02:44.759 --> 02:48.003
I promise you, this is not
how I feel about my friends.

02:48.490 --> 02:50.692
And I hate myself for it.
You get it?

02:50.800 --> 02:52.414
So you want to be my friend really?

02:52.531 --> 02:53.724
<i>Really?</i>

02:53.965 --> 02:55.503
Then you gotta leave me alone.

02:56.520 --> 02:57.961
Okay.

02:59.057 --> 03:00.458
I'm sorry.

03:00.570 --> 03:02.101
And, yes, I'll leave you alone.

04:03.182 --> 04:04.363
You going somewhere?

04:07.184 --> 04:08.338
I sent Jones to find you.

04:08.455 --> 04:09.650
Yeah.

04:10.064 --> 04:11.374
You want to talk about it?

04:12.262 --> 04:13.375
No.

04:15.143 --> 04:17.569
Look, Sam, I know
what you're going through.

04:18.116 --> 04:20.033
I've been there.
I know that--

04:20.144 --> 04:21.173
Captain, please.

04:21.289 --> 04:23.207
I know that finding
the right way to grieve

04:23.322 --> 04:24.900
is never easy.

04:25.013 --> 04:27.769
But you do not have to do this alone.

04:27.869 --> 04:29.578
God knows you were there for me.

04:34.635 --> 04:36.477
The administration has sent a destroyer

04:36.854 --> 04:38.652
to intercept the Chinese supply ship.

04:38.754 --> 04:40.887
I'm taking the Colorado out
to intervene.

04:41.894 --> 04:43.529
Our people are starving.
Everyone's falling apart.

04:43.640 --> 04:44.545
We need the food and
supplies on that ship.

04:44.546 --> 04:45.449
What are we doing here?

04:45.569 --> 04:46.872
What are we doing?
I thought we were supposed to be

04:46.995 --> 04:48.192
getting to the truth
so we could all get home.

04:48.301 --> 04:49.678
Isn't that what we're
supposed to be doing?

04:49.679 --> 04:51.054
We have to survive first.

04:51.198 --> 04:52.747
How, by aligning with the Chinese?

04:53.258 --> 04:54.256
How does that get us home?

04:54.376 --> 04:56.270
You see any other options, XO?

04:56.937 --> 04:58.875
There's not a whole bunch
of folks stepping up

04:58.998 --> 05:00.040
to take our side.

05:00.151 --> 05:02.935
I didn't realize we had
our hat in hand, Sir.

05:03.052 --> 05:04.806
I will not allow
the people of this island

05:04.930 --> 05:06.581
and our people to starve.

05:07.370 --> 05:09.274
I didn't do this, my wife didn't die,

05:09.412 --> 05:12.556
so you could become king of some
third-rate banana republic.

05:15.242 --> 05:18.028
You're relieved, Commander.

05:19.718 --> 05:21.471
I'm way ahead of you, Captain.

05:25.603 --> 05:27.402
Have you all lost your minds?

05:27.508 --> 05:30.201
A coup d'etat
in the United States of America,

05:30.320 --> 05:31.997
that <i>is</i> what you're
talking about, correct?

05:32.106 --> 05:33.263
Mr. Speaker, if we don't act,

05:33.386 --> 05:34.918
there won't be
a United States of America.

05:35.067 --> 05:37.669
This is Executive Order 188,

05:37.799 --> 05:39.455
issued by the president,

05:39.587 --> 05:40.943
directing a team of Navy SEALs

05:41.110 --> 05:43.922
to assassinate Dr. Oscar Nils,

05:44.032 --> 05:46.767
the UN weapons inspector in Pakistan.

05:46.882 --> 05:48.054
This has been verified?

05:48.169 --> 05:50.057
That is an authentic order, Sir.

05:50.186 --> 05:52.885
No, has it been verified that
the order was carried out?

05:53.008 --> 05:54.528
The inspector is dead.

05:54.647 --> 05:56.137
At the hands of the Pakistanis.

05:56.250 --> 05:58.224
No, Connie. We did it.

05:58.351 --> 05:59.518
We killed him.

05:59.733 --> 06:01.004
Our SEALs.

06:02.418 --> 06:03.777
You're supposed to be in jail, Admiral.

06:03.898 --> 06:05.498
As far as anyone knows, I am.

06:05.629 --> 06:07.552
I just have a few friends
in low places.

06:07.674 --> 06:09.680
Okay. We all need
to walk outta here

06:09.806 --> 06:11.105
this very second,

06:11.225 --> 06:13.733
before somebody says something
they're gonna regret.

06:13.868 --> 06:15.945
Mr. Speaker, you know
I'm not generally squeamish

06:16.076 --> 06:17.507
about the preemptive use of force.

06:17.625 --> 06:18.940
In fact, I've personally jammed

06:19.083 --> 06:21.481
quite a few appropriation bills
past you in my time.

06:21.621 --> 06:23.817
And since politically,
I straddle a line

06:23.933 --> 06:25.980
just slightly to the left
of Attila The Hun,

06:26.166 --> 06:27.389
you will believe me when I say,

06:27.512 --> 06:29.716
I did not get into this
in order to take down

06:29.854 --> 06:32.505
my best and only paying customer.

06:34.417 --> 06:36.468
This is Petty Officer Barry Hopper,

06:36.590 --> 06:38.329
the Navy SEAL who received orders

06:38.462 --> 06:40.250
to plant evidence of suitcase nukes

06:40.360 --> 06:42.673
and to assassinate
the nuclear inspector

06:42.804 --> 06:43.622
who had determined

06:43.750 --> 06:45.990
that there were no such devices
in Pakistan.

06:46.427 --> 06:47.919
And this is him

06:48.053 --> 06:49.750
carrying out those orders,

06:50.861 --> 06:53.436
which were then followed
by a nuclear first strike.

06:53.564 --> 06:56.016
General Ashland, Mr. Speaker,
you both know me.

06:56.139 --> 06:58.772
I really don't care
about anyone other than myself.

06:58.905 --> 07:01.771
So if this got me pissed off,

07:02.686 --> 07:06.898
what should it do to upstanding,
civic-minded men

07:07.119 --> 07:09.600
such as yourselves?

07:13.141 --> 07:14.978
You're sending me a ship unescorted?

07:15.124 --> 07:16.324
The supplies we promised.

07:16.454 --> 07:18.283
I warned you the US response
would be aggressive.

07:18.387 --> 07:20.545
Now if China isn't willing
to defend its vessel,

07:20.664 --> 07:21.552
why do I need you?

07:21.674 --> 07:23.033
Well, you were willing
to take on your country--

07:23.134 --> 07:24.708
You misunderstand me.

07:24.819 --> 07:26.611
I didn't join with you at great cost

07:26.719 --> 07:27.845
to any hopes I have of ever going home

07:27.954 --> 07:29.213
so that you could send me a ship

07:29.335 --> 07:31.006
with little chance
of ever reaching my shores.

07:31.132 --> 07:32.552
What would you have my country do?

07:33.112 --> 07:34.104
Be of use to me.

07:34.196 --> 07:36.250
Back up your words
and protect your own vessel.

07:36.369 --> 07:37.857
And start a war with the US?

07:38.246 --> 07:40.598
We're willing to help,
Captain, but there are limits.

07:40.721 --> 07:41.608
And why should we help you

07:41.727 --> 07:43.338
more than you're willing
to help yourself?

07:43.555 --> 07:45.455
If the US stops
this ship, maybe sinks it,

07:45.565 --> 07:47.909
it becomes the aggressor
on the international stage.

07:48.352 --> 07:49.139
If it lets it through,

07:49.253 --> 07:51.007
China becomes a great humanitarian.

07:51.123 --> 07:52.233
And it also wins.

07:52.347 --> 07:53.745
You played this very well.

07:54.038 --> 07:55.117
Thank you.

07:56.524 --> 07:58.470
Except that you've given <i>me</i> nothing.

07:59.345 --> 08:00.420
Untrue.

08:00.541 --> 08:01.953
Even in the face
of threats from your nation,

08:02.068 --> 08:03.296
I offer you food and aid.

08:03.409 --> 08:04.938
What other nation would even dare?

08:05.037 --> 08:07.369
Life on this island
is what I offer you.

08:07.950 --> 08:10.257
What happens out there is what
you give me in return.

08:10.357 --> 08:12.165
You want a confrontation with the US?

08:17.224 --> 08:18.906
For how many years has the US been seen

08:19.039 --> 08:20.506
as the guardian superpower
of the world,

08:20.861 --> 08:22.090
the rational center?

08:22.196 --> 08:24.376
Your administration can
no longer claim that role

08:24.497 --> 08:25.656
with any credibility.

08:25.780 --> 08:26.668
Please understand me.

08:26.785 --> 08:28.531
I won't be a proxy in your fight.

08:28.663 --> 08:30.717
A proxy with a nuclear arsenal.

08:31.197 --> 08:32.696
There are worse things to be.

08:32.995 --> 08:34.488
Be careful, Mr. Ambassador.

08:35.337 --> 08:37.062
There's still a very dangerous
game you're playing.

08:37.177 --> 08:38.501
I've swapped chess pieces with the US

08:38.621 --> 08:40.570
for many years now, Captain.

08:40.698 --> 08:42.376
I'm not talking about the US.

08:45.912 --> 08:47.127
Officer on deck.

08:47.236 --> 08:48.293
At ease.

08:48.405 --> 08:49.889
This is Chaplin.
Where's my transport?

08:49.996 --> 08:52.765
Captain, the Colorado
is still 20 minutes from port.

08:52.940 --> 08:54.773
We'll send a jeep for you
as soon as they're close.

08:54.881 --> 08:55.980
Copy that.

09:04.751 --> 09:05.957
Whew.

09:06.742 --> 09:07.818
It's crazy out there.

09:07.933 --> 09:09.174
Where you coming from?

09:09.539 --> 09:12.015
There was, uh, some trouble
with the launch.

09:12.410 --> 09:13.566
I took care of it.

09:14.222 --> 09:16.107
You got anything back there
to warm me up?

09:21.747 --> 09:22.653
Right there.

09:22.773 --> 09:24.593
There's where
our mission parameters changed.

09:24.785 --> 09:25.837
I was ordered to plant evidence

09:25.964 --> 09:27.568
that Pakistan posed
an imminent nuclear threat

09:27.685 --> 09:28.847
to the United States.

09:28.995 --> 09:30.287
I carried out that order.

09:35.186 --> 09:36.693
What do you want me to do?

09:37.380 --> 09:38.398
Tomorrow

09:38.525 --> 09:40.143
at 1200 hours,

09:40.284 --> 09:41.895
army units out of Fort McNair

09:42.034 --> 09:43.823
under the command of General MacAvoy,

09:43.983 --> 09:45.728
will shut the city down--

09:45.846 --> 09:48.756
all bridges, tunnels, no one in or out.

09:48.884 --> 09:50.467
At the same time, the EADS,

09:50.606 --> 09:53.045
under General Ashland,
will enforce a no-fly zone

09:53.163 --> 09:54.107
over the Capitol.

09:54.209 --> 09:55.695
And once those two objectives
have been met,

09:55.854 --> 09:58.905
a marine force recon contingent
under General Reid

09:59.026 --> 10:00.128
will take the White House.

10:00.240 --> 10:01.769
And there they will place the president

10:01.901 --> 10:03.761
and the vice president under arrest.

10:03.884 --> 10:04.753
Now, Mr. Speaker,

10:04.877 --> 10:06.978
you will have already called
a joint session of congress,

10:07.109 --> 10:08.573
and there you will outline

10:08.696 --> 10:10.350
the case against the administration

10:10.545 --> 10:13.518
and announce that you, as third
in the line of succession,

10:13.692 --> 10:16.022
are assuming the presidency.

10:22.611 --> 10:23.891
How's the XO doing?

10:24.095 --> 10:26.486
Must be horrible
to lose someone you love.

10:26.869 --> 10:28.301
I was at sea when I heard.

10:29.618 --> 10:31.114
My first command.

10:32.405 --> 10:35.222
A helicopter plucked me
out of the Adriatic.

10:35.852 --> 10:37.665
I took a transport from Cyprus.

10:38.636 --> 10:40.493
And the first thing I saw
when I got there

10:42.055 --> 10:43.660
were my two boys.

10:44.345 --> 10:45.560
Now...

10:46.472 --> 10:47.914
I've been in combat.

10:49.907 --> 10:51.509
But I've never seen fear
in anyone's eyes

10:51.641 --> 10:53.635
like I saw in the eyes
of my sons that day.

10:56.099 --> 10:57.574
'Cause they knew.

10:59.114 --> 11:00.183
So...

11:00.884 --> 11:01.827
my wife's illness

11:01.986 --> 11:03.903
was the longest
continuous period of time

11:04.045 --> 11:05.639
that we ever spent together.

11:06.906 --> 11:08.205
And the truth is,

11:08.320 --> 11:10.951
I was more married to the Navy
than I ever was to her.

11:11.656 --> 11:13.324
I was a better father
to the men under my command

11:13.451 --> 11:15.133
than I was to my own sons.

11:16.174 --> 11:17.704
I was given a blessing,

11:17.961 --> 11:19.299
but was...

11:21.356 --> 11:23.720
too foolish to fully know what it was.

11:24.736 --> 11:26.440
I don't have any kids so...

11:26.987 --> 11:29.276
maybe I don't know what
I'm talking about, but...

11:30.043 --> 11:31.442
if you heard me talk about someone

11:31.571 --> 11:33.808
the way that you just talked
about yourself,

11:33.929 --> 11:36.793
you would think that I was
the biggest bitch walking.

11:36.919 --> 11:38.460
I didn't have to stay at sea.

11:39.089 --> 11:40.887
But I wanted to make captain.

11:42.153 --> 11:43.872
My eyes were open.

11:44.088 --> 11:45.923
I knew exactly what I was doing.

11:47.810 --> 11:49.570
Just like I know now.

11:51.521 --> 11:53.492
My eyes are open.

11:55.119 --> 11:56.285
Sir.

11:56.401 --> 11:58.067
The last launch is ready to depart.

11:58.209 --> 11:59.356
Jeep's waiting.

12:02.032 --> 12:03.356
That's our ride.

12:13.509 --> 12:14.708
Thanks.

12:19.736 --> 12:22.444
You said there was something
you needed to discuss.

12:22.822 --> 12:24.631
You're a beautiful woman, Sophie.

12:25.368 --> 12:27.824
Been educated in
the finest Parisian schools.

12:28.460 --> 12:30.583
You're accustomed to the finer things,

12:31.174 --> 12:32.954
yet you maroon yourself on this island

12:33.077 --> 12:34.494
in the middle of nowhere.

12:34.593 --> 12:35.576
This is where my work is.

12:35.708 --> 12:37.845
This is where you <i>choose</i>
your work to be.

12:37.963 --> 12:39.090
You're running away from life.

12:39.203 --> 12:40.718
I don't propose to know what pain it is

12:40.844 --> 12:42.237
you are running from,

12:42.368 --> 12:43.842
but here you are.

12:44.098 --> 12:45.874
And now you are wasting yourself,

12:46.010 --> 12:48.593
mooning over
this married naval officer.

12:48.704 --> 12:50.089
You don't know
what you're talking about.

12:50.209 --> 12:51.604
I know <i>you.</i>

12:52.467 --> 12:53.445
I care for you,

12:53.582 --> 12:55.422
very deeply, more than you know.

12:56.684 --> 12:58.756
And I know you care for this island.

12:59.958 --> 13:02.437
And you worry about
what will become of it.

13:06.850 --> 13:08.268
Open it.

13:08.602 --> 13:11.047
I believe the greatest gift
is the gift of truth.

13:15.262 --> 13:15.994
Julian--

13:16.108 --> 13:17.649
Stop, please.

13:17.759 --> 13:20.205
I had someone else run the soil test.

13:20.342 --> 13:23.253
This island is worth a fortune
in rare earth elements.

13:24.057 --> 13:25.409
You lied to me, Sophie.

13:25.506 --> 13:27.342
Julian, if you exploit those minerals,

13:27.471 --> 13:29.961
everything you love about
this island will be destroyed.

13:30.066 --> 13:30.811
This is my home.

13:30.928 --> 13:32.869
What makes you think
I would destroy this island?

13:33.297 --> 13:34.676
Look, the situation will change.

13:34.793 --> 13:35.963
The Americans will leave,

13:36.078 --> 13:37.449
and things will return to normal.

13:37.560 --> 13:38.828
And when they do,

13:38.949 --> 13:40.110
why live in the NATO housing

13:40.235 --> 13:42.164
when you can live in a villa
on the coast?

13:42.991 --> 13:44.611
I can provide for you comfort,
security,

13:44.743 --> 13:46.712
opportunity.

13:48.122 --> 13:49.365
Oh, Julian--

13:49.483 --> 13:50.985
You look as though
you just ate a beetle.

13:51.090 --> 13:52.947
Don't worry.
I'm not talking about love.

13:53.747 --> 13:55.558
I know you don't love me.

13:56.534 --> 13:58.570
What then?

13:58.680 --> 14:00.423
Every man has a weakness.

14:01.214 --> 14:02.660
You are mine.

14:04.305 --> 14:06.348
And I accept you where you are.

14:06.955 --> 14:09.471
Thus, what I propose

14:09.793 --> 14:11.220
is a partnership...

14:12.126 --> 14:14.271
based on mutual affection.

14:14.436 --> 14:16.100
We can take care
of this island together.

14:16.208 --> 14:18.189
You can be my conscience.

14:18.337 --> 14:20.056
And I will reward my conscience

14:20.172 --> 14:22.551
with whatever her heart desires.

14:23.415 --> 14:24.417
Who knows?

14:24.560 --> 14:25.562
In time, you may find

14:25.680 --> 14:29.273
that you feel for me
the same way I feel for you.

14:30.523 --> 14:32.220
Bon appetit.

14:32.471 --> 14:33.899
<i>Merci.</i>

14:49.856 --> 14:51.440
No more public rumbling.

14:51.599 --> 14:53.009
No more breaking the rules.

14:53.323 --> 14:54.520
We do this right.

14:54.662 --> 14:56.362
Find the men we need, and then
when the moment's right,

14:56.482 --> 14:57.326
we take over.

14:57.450 --> 14:58.650
Why don't we just take him out?

14:59.201 --> 15:00.304
Be done with it.

15:00.564 --> 15:02.507
What? No. No, no, no.
Hell, no.

15:02.614 --> 15:03.987
We are not doing that.

15:04.099 --> 15:05.354
That is not what this is about.

15:05.457 --> 15:07.457
Well, keeping him alive only
makes things more complicated.

15:08.105 --> 15:09.608
Y'all think about Bin Laden.

15:09.723 --> 15:11.553
Double tap, dumped in the Indian Ocean.

15:11.690 --> 15:12.730
He's out of sight, out of mind.

15:12.840 --> 15:14.945
Wallace, our captain
is not a terrorist.

15:15.065 --> 15:15.831
No?

15:15.957 --> 15:17.185
Well, what the hell is he?

15:17.325 --> 15:19.387
Stealing a sub,
launching a nuke at DC--

15:19.505 --> 15:22.308
hell, he's out there right now
starting a superpower showdown

15:22.435 --> 15:23.948
over a boatload of damn rice.

15:24.102 --> 15:25.348
Rice? No, it's not--

15:25.349 --> 15:26.594
- In South Carolina, we
call that a terrorist.

15:31.648 --> 15:33.946
COB, you know we wouldn't
make a move without your go.

15:34.066 --> 15:35.209
But terminating the captain's command

15:35.330 --> 15:37.171
may be an option we have to consider.

15:41.364 --> 15:44.215
Everybody, say hello to the XO.

17:02.751 --> 17:05.522
Oh! Oh!

17:21.175 --> 17:23.188
Might I suggest a white flag?

17:23.328 --> 17:24.407
A temporary parlay

17:24.550 --> 17:26.952
so I can get the mud
outta my butt crack?!

17:43.145 --> 17:45.507
Let's go get some cover.

17:51.009 --> 17:53.000
Sonar, report on
the destroyer's position.

17:53.153 --> 17:54.555
It's the USS Patrick Lawrence, Sir.

17:54.676 --> 17:57.524
Bearing 2-2-9,
range 1 8,000 yards.

17:57.644 --> 17:58.847
Very well.

17:58.965 --> 17:59.688
Lieutenant Cahill,

17:59.803 --> 18:00.899
get the destroyer's captain
on the line.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.090
Aye aye, Sir.

18:04.114 --> 18:05.161
USS Patrick Lawrence,

18:05.297 --> 18:06.806
this is the USS Colorado.

18:07.030 --> 18:08.185
How copy? Over.

18:08.417 --> 18:10.924
This is the USS Patrick Lawrence.

18:11.053 --> 18:12.460
Captain Evan Thorn.

18:12.578 --> 18:14.213
It's good to speak with you
again, Captain.

18:14.762 --> 18:16.210
Do we know each other, Captain?

18:16.312 --> 18:17.318
Annapolis.

18:17.445 --> 18:19.313
I was at a lecture you gave
some years back.

18:19.410 --> 18:20.943
It was the "men will do anything

18:21.044 --> 18:23.117
if their cause is just" speech.

18:23.236 --> 18:25.308
You are one hell
of a public orator, Captain.

18:25.485 --> 18:27.012
That's very kind of you.

18:27.117 --> 18:28.497
You know, I've read everything
you've ever written

18:28.626 --> 18:29.756
on wartime naval code,

18:29.883 --> 18:32.353
and although the circumstances
might suggest otherwise,

18:32.481 --> 18:35.269
I must confess, I'm a bit of a fan.

18:35.383 --> 18:37.187
That's very flattering,
and I hope we can find

18:37.309 --> 18:39.378
a peaceful solution
to our conflict today.

18:39.535 --> 18:41.531
As you know, I have
a Chinese merchant vessel

18:41.662 --> 18:43.256
en route to Sainte Marina
carrying supplies

18:43.370 --> 18:44.705
vital to the well-being
of my crew

18:44.826 --> 18:46.266
and to the local civilians.

18:46.499 --> 18:47.797
I want to make it very clear

18:48.071 --> 18:50.525
that any action on your part
to impede its progress

18:50.737 --> 18:52.538
will be taken as an act of aggression

18:52.659 --> 18:54.284
and will be met in kind.

18:54.395 --> 18:55.379
Aggression?

18:55.503 --> 18:57.291
Your boomer versus my destroyer?

18:58.498 --> 19:00.310
We both know you could
blow me out of the water

19:00.435 --> 19:01.740
and never even break a sweat.

19:01.853 --> 19:03.214
Then shall I regard
your presence here today

19:03.386 --> 19:05.852
as nothing more
than a respectful protest?

19:05.976 --> 19:07.399
No, Captain.

19:07.518 --> 19:09.809
My orders are to stop that supply ship.

19:09.981 --> 19:11.527
But this isn't about hardware.

19:11.666 --> 19:12.930
It's about what I believe

19:13.089 --> 19:14.713
and what you believe.

19:14.974 --> 19:17.661
And most importantly,
it's what I know about you.

19:17.855 --> 19:19.739
And what is it you
think you know about me?

19:19.873 --> 19:23.758
Marcus Chaplin will never fire
on a US Navy ship, ever.

19:23.890 --> 19:25.833
This is a humanitarian mission,
Captain Thorn, and I--

19:25.946 --> 19:27.565
I don't care
what kind of mission it is.

19:27.690 --> 19:29.356
As far as your government is concerned,

19:29.458 --> 19:32.192
the Chinese are aiding
an enemy of the United States.

19:32.381 --> 19:34.819
This is an unarmed civilian vessel.

19:35.711 --> 19:37.205
I have my orders.

19:37.390 --> 19:40.552
That supply ship
<i>never</i> gets to Sainte Marina,

19:40.739 --> 19:41.952
period.

19:47.119 --> 19:49.562
Lieutenant Shepard, intercept range

19:49.692 --> 19:51.560
of the Patrick Lawrence
to the supply ship?

19:51.673 --> 19:54.618
He'll be on her in approximately
22 minutes, Sir.

19:56.249 --> 19:57.936
Captain Thorn, you have 20
minutes to turn your ship around

19:58.058 --> 20:00.626
or prepare to receive fire,
period. Colorado out.

20:07.374 --> 20:09.145
You keep doing that,
you're gonna pass out.

20:09.261 --> 20:10.446
What are you doing here?

20:10.553 --> 20:12.095
I tried to get off
when your captain got on,

20:12.206 --> 20:14.386
but he wasn't wasting any time
in his big rush off to war,

20:14.500 --> 20:15.908
so here I am.

20:16.411 --> 20:18.133
He's seriously thinking about firing

20:18.261 --> 20:20.258
on an American destroyer.

20:23.275 --> 20:24.364
Well...

20:24.592 --> 20:27.586
you had to figure the shooting
was gonna start sometime.

20:30.222 --> 20:31.984
If you're not prepared for that,
what are you doing here?

20:32.105 --> 20:34.073
I know people
on the Patrick Lawrence--

20:34.202 --> 20:36.698
friends, sailors, just like you and me.

20:36.977 --> 20:38.679
If we fire...

20:39.950 --> 20:42.691
the payload on these Mark 48s...

20:45.252 --> 20:46.798
there'll be nothing left
of the Patrick Lawrence

20:46.955 --> 20:48.461
but DNA.

20:48.567 --> 20:50.598
One punch.
That's the design.

20:51.918 --> 20:54.574
The Navy's not big
on nonlethal options.

20:59.742 --> 21:00.879
What?

21:10.282 --> 21:11.088
Your guys back there,

21:11.219 --> 21:12.575
they're talking
full-blown mutiny.

21:12.710 --> 21:14.819
Yeah. Sounds like to me

21:14.943 --> 21:17.642
they're headed towards
a good old-fashioned hanging.

21:17.757 --> 21:19.906
Is that where you are, ready
to murder your old friend?

21:20.033 --> 21:21.627
Hold on.

21:21.814 --> 21:23.719
I'm just a bachelorette shopping for

21:23.840 --> 21:25.813
my Mr. Right
way out of this suck hole.

21:25.929 --> 21:26.806
You gotta remember,

21:26.913 --> 21:28.234
I was there when he
released you from the brig.

21:28.358 --> 21:29.244
I was there when you stood there,

21:29.366 --> 21:30.141
you looked him right in the eye,

21:30.266 --> 21:31.656
and you promised
you wouldn't work against him.

21:31.820 --> 21:33.609
Yeah, and he promised me
he was gonna get himself

21:33.737 --> 21:35.450
and the rest of us back home.

21:35.683 --> 21:38.000
Instead we got a Chinese
ambassador in our backyard,

21:38.131 --> 21:40.150
and he's ordering takeout for 8,000.

21:44.913 --> 21:46.334
What the hell happened to you?

21:46.488 --> 21:48.363
Stepped on a jellyfish.

21:50.138 --> 21:51.688
Or a blowtorch.

21:51.787 --> 21:53.202
Or a blowtorch?

21:54.457 --> 21:55.969
How you managing the pain?

21:56.078 --> 21:57.161
Oh, don't worry about me.

21:57.275 --> 22:00.095
I got my stuff under control,
unlike some of us.

22:00.358 --> 22:01.584
What does that mean?

22:01.701 --> 22:03.373
That's the problem with you, XO.

22:03.490 --> 22:05.485
You joined up because you had
nowhere else to go,

22:05.606 --> 22:06.575
or maybe you were lost,

22:06.706 --> 22:09.407
and you thought the military
could sort your way out.

22:10.413 --> 22:13.311
But you're not a patriot, not at heart.

22:13.438 --> 22:15.790
My country, right or wrong,
is that you, COB?

22:15.901 --> 22:17.412
Yes, Sir.

22:17.973 --> 22:20.280
But you never thought you'd be tested.

22:20.755 --> 22:22.549
You thought you'd just
get your promotions,

22:22.674 --> 22:26.295
raise some rug rats, retire fat.

22:27.215 --> 22:30.691
Never have to say what your
country really means to you.

22:31.041 --> 22:33.349
But you do now, XO.

22:33.801 --> 22:35.602
You gotta decide.

22:43.872 --> 22:46.321
Sir. We have a plan,

22:46.460 --> 22:48.837
a way to avoid bloodshed,
or at least too much bloodshed.

22:48.947 --> 22:50.015
I'm listening.

22:50.298 --> 22:51.515
I've got munitions training.

22:51.631 --> 22:53.122
I could rig one of your torpedoes,

22:53.295 --> 22:55.286
remove 80% of the payload.

22:55.420 --> 22:57.015
So if we're forced to fire,

22:57.255 --> 22:59.740
we can send the destroyer home
in a sling, not a coffin.

22:59.846 --> 23:01.387
The clock's running down.
Get her done.

23:03.717 --> 23:05.592
The Patrick Lawrence
is reaching firing range,

23:05.709 --> 23:06.956
six minutes.

23:07.552 --> 23:09.237
I won't wait for you.

23:10.569 --> 23:11.958
Munitions training?

23:12.075 --> 23:14.548
Yeah. A little.

23:17.919 --> 23:18.894
Captain on the conn.

23:19.021 --> 23:20.105
Battle stations.

23:22.015 --> 23:23.525
Torpedo room, conn.

23:23.638 --> 23:25.658
Report status of torpedo modifications.

23:27.267 --> 23:28.047
King.

23:28.152 --> 23:30.062
- In the works, Sir.
- You have four minutes,

23:30.206 --> 23:31.583
38 seconds.

23:31.915 --> 23:33.015
Roger, Sir.

23:34.674 --> 23:36.355
Patrick Lawrence
maneuvering into range.

23:37.799 --> 23:39.000
Captain Thorn, I repeat,

23:39.111 --> 23:40.753
I'm prepared to do what I have to do.

23:40.919 --> 23:43.030
I'm talking to the man
who bounced a sailor

23:43.163 --> 23:45.395
for failing to hold salute
for the Arizona.

23:45.546 --> 23:46.795
That's going way back, Captain.

23:46.991 --> 23:48.799
The same man who, a short time ago,

23:48.965 --> 23:50.757
refused to fire his nuclear missiles

23:50.876 --> 23:51.717
because he didn't have

23:51.859 --> 23:54.265
the proper line of communication.

23:54.378 --> 23:55.954
You're not by-the-book,
Captain.

23:56.075 --> 23:57.667
You wrote the damn thing.

23:58.064 --> 23:59.578
So firing on your own?

24:00.414 --> 24:01.724
No, that's a line
of self-betrayal

24:01.836 --> 24:03.243
you're not ever gonna cross.

24:03.354 --> 24:05.433
You have to be absolutely
sure of that, Captain.

24:05.555 --> 24:08.020
I've done my homework.
That's why they sent me.

24:08.139 --> 24:10.637
"They"? Who are you
taking orders from?

24:10.736 --> 24:11.856
Do you even know?

24:11.966 --> 24:14.324
Last I looked, Uncle Sam
was still writing the checks.

24:14.440 --> 24:16.455
What if our government
isn't our government anymore,

24:16.577 --> 24:18.833
and my cause is, in fact, justified?

24:18.961 --> 24:21.589
Don't pull that political
head trip with me.

24:21.831 --> 24:23.877
I know who the enemy is.

24:24.087 --> 24:26.949
The problem is,
for the first time in your life,

24:27.122 --> 24:28.253
you don't.

24:28.367 --> 24:29.840
No, the problem is,

24:29.975 --> 24:31.051
you think the man you're talking to

24:31.174 --> 24:33.402
is the same one
whose lecture you attended.

24:33.605 --> 24:34.768
He's not.

24:35.719 --> 24:37.525
Turn your ship around, Captain.

24:37.777 --> 24:39.541
Request denied.

24:45.625 --> 24:47.447
We've got this drill
during BUD/S training.

24:48.010 --> 24:51.029
We lay in the ice-cold surf
for what seems like forever,

24:51.165 --> 24:51.964
nonstop.

24:52.098 --> 24:53.293
The sun goes down, moon comes up,

24:53.403 --> 24:54.504
sun comes up again,

24:54.613 --> 24:56.560
we're still in the water, arms locked.

24:56.734 --> 24:58.527
Feels like you're gonna die.

24:58.723 --> 24:59.512
Sounds fun.

24:59.651 --> 25:00.919
No, here's the fun part.

25:01.048 --> 25:02.444
They sit coffee and doughnuts
on a table

25:02.630 --> 25:04.506
just in sight of the surf
next to a bell.

25:04.684 --> 25:06.200
That way, when you're ready to quit,

25:06.325 --> 25:08.683
you just stand up, walk over
to the table, ring the bell--

25:08.798 --> 25:11.341
You SEALs never get tired
of telling this story, do you?

25:13.866 --> 25:15.318
Uh, is that...

25:15.427 --> 25:16.586
Yeah.

25:18.383 --> 25:21.721
Don't... drop... this.

25:23.180 --> 25:24.339
The point is,

25:24.467 --> 25:26.007
I could tell who was gonna
ring that bell

25:26.170 --> 25:27.979
before we ever got in the water.

25:30.076 --> 25:31.734
I could see it in their eyes.

25:31.889 --> 25:33.285
You're talking about the captain.

25:33.416 --> 25:34.879
He's not a bell ringer, Grace.

25:35.012 --> 25:36.513
He'll see this through
to the bitter end.

25:36.763 --> 25:37.857
The question is--

25:37.970 --> 25:39.859
Lieutenant Shepard,
I need that torpedo now.

25:42.334 --> 25:43.665
We're close, Sir.

25:43.786 --> 25:45.181
Exact time? Report now.

25:47.459 --> 25:48.399
Two minutes, Sir.

25:48.517 --> 25:49.831
You have 60 seconds.

25:50.832 --> 25:53.136
Dive. Periscope depth.
All head one-third.

25:53.302 --> 25:54.474
Lieutenant Cahill, how much time?

25:54.642 --> 25:56.048
Patrick Lawrence will be
in firing range

25:56.166 --> 25:57.315
in 30 seconds, Sir.

25:57.430 --> 25:59.706
I will carry out my orders, Captain.

25:59.863 --> 26:01.113
20 seconds, Sir.

26:01.281 --> 26:02.955
Captain Thorn,
this is my final warning.

26:03.093 --> 26:05.014
You want the world
to think you're a madman,

26:05.140 --> 26:06.831
but I know you're not.

26:06.951 --> 26:09.023
Testing that theory
would be a fatal mistake.

26:09.163 --> 26:12.561
I am testing it.
Prepare phalanx gun.

26:18.431 --> 26:19.507
Patrick Lawrence has a firing solution

26:19.621 --> 26:20.840
locked on Chinese vessel.

26:20.940 --> 26:22.278
Fire!

26:28.139 --> 26:29.994
Patrick Lawrence ordering
Chinese to heave to

26:30.118 --> 26:32.153
or the next barrage will be broadside.

26:32.343 --> 26:33.523
He's gonna sink her, Sir.

26:33.631 --> 26:35.724
She's steady on course.
She's not turning around.

26:36.678 --> 26:38.183
Lieutenant Shepard, make tubes
one and two fully ready

26:38.266 --> 26:39.034
in all respects.

26:39.140 --> 26:40.729
Mark 48 ADCAP war shots.

26:40.992 --> 26:42.104
No. Wait.

26:42.880 --> 26:44.851
Sir, we're close.
One more minute.

26:44.961 --> 26:46.113
Patrick Lawrence
coming around again, Sir.

26:46.225 --> 26:47.407
In one minute, that supply ship

26:47.528 --> 26:49.110
and everyone aboard her will be dead.

26:49.453 --> 26:51.390
Sir, we'll be loading tube three
with the modified torpedo

26:51.522 --> 26:52.444
momentarily.

26:52.544 --> 26:54.818
Make tubes one and two
fully ready in all respects.

26:55.133 --> 26:56.687
Firing point procedures
on the Patrick Lawrence,

26:56.794 --> 26:58.681
tube one primary, tube two backup.

27:03.688 --> 27:05.370
Solution ready, Sir.

27:12.397 --> 27:13.735
Lower all masts and antennas.

27:13.850 --> 27:15.505
Dive. Make your depth
200 feet.

27:15.620 --> 27:17.389
Dive. 5-degree down angle.

27:17.515 --> 27:19.610
- We have a firing solution.
- Fire one.

27:19.732 --> 27:21.670
No. Belay that.
Do not fire.

27:21.830 --> 27:24.192
Oh, son of a bitch!

27:24.572 --> 27:26.457
Modified torpedo ready
in tube three, Sir.

27:26.568 --> 27:27.689
The modified torpedo is ready

27:27.799 --> 27:29.529
to fire, Sir.

27:30.141 --> 27:31.489
Tube three, Sir.

27:34.093 --> 27:35.437
Fire three.

27:35.574 --> 27:36.798
Fire three.

27:38.683 --> 27:40.069
Torpedo in the water!

27:41.338 --> 27:42.755
Rig ship for impact.

27:46.411 --> 27:47.832
We have detonation, Sir.

27:53.202 --> 27:54.387
Have one screw out of commission.

27:54.512 --> 27:55.873
Sounds like...

27:58.788 --> 28:00.148
that's it.

28:00.275 --> 28:02.095
Her hull's holding together.

28:03.192 --> 28:04.431
Captain Thorn, if you retreat now

28:04.555 --> 28:06.183
you can get your men back home safely.

28:06.376 --> 28:07.734
You have ten seconds.

28:08.008 --> 28:11.025
I promise you, the next one
will put you at the bottom.

28:15.325 --> 28:16.667
Sir...

28:16.782 --> 28:18.135
contact turning on new heading.

28:18.264 --> 28:19.628
1-3-9.

28:21.141 --> 28:22.941
She's bugging out, Sir.

28:33.248 --> 28:34.795
Lieutenant Shepard, a word.

28:35.219 --> 28:36.583
You disobeyed my order.

28:36.806 --> 28:37.523
No, Sir, I--

28:37.629 --> 28:39.221
You delayed carrying it out.

28:39.441 --> 28:40.088
Yes, Sir, I did.

28:40.196 --> 28:42.414
When I'm on the conn, my word is law!

28:44.093 --> 28:45.492
- I understand.
- Do you?

28:45.632 --> 28:46.767
Because I need to know
that next time--

28:46.891 --> 28:48.979
and mark my words,
there will be a next time--

28:49.101 --> 28:50.323
my orders are to be
carried out--

28:50.440 --> 28:53.935
my exact orders--
without hesitation.

28:55.939 --> 28:57.538
I hear you, Sir.

28:58.285 --> 29:00.358
But you are sailing
in some uncharted waters.

29:00.489 --> 29:01.840
And believe it or not...

29:02.434 --> 29:04.478
I did this for you.

29:17.875 --> 29:19.271
What if he's right?

29:19.995 --> 29:21.765
Obviously the administration's
off the rails.

29:21.882 --> 29:24.132
They're selling out every value
you swore to protect.

29:24.304 --> 29:25.890
You want me to have
a come to Jesus moment?

29:26.013 --> 29:27.449
That's fine, but you, too.

29:27.652 --> 29:29.220
What if he's right?

29:29.350 --> 29:30.835
What if you're fighting
the wrong fight?

29:30.930 --> 29:31.813
Being holed up over here

29:31.940 --> 29:33.138
while the fighting's
going on over there,

29:33.259 --> 29:34.483
that doesn't work for me.

29:34.603 --> 29:36.292
So what are you gonna do,
kill Marcus to get home?

29:36.407 --> 29:37.246
Is that it?

29:37.370 --> 29:39.105
That's not gonna happen.
Not on my watch.

29:39.344 --> 29:40.853
But you gotta be honest with yourself.

29:40.976 --> 29:42.193
Marcus is different.

29:42.655 --> 29:44.290
I've known him for 20 years,

29:44.450 --> 29:47.102
and Marcus 2.0 is a guy
I don't even recognize.

29:47.225 --> 29:49.004
Yeah, you're damn right he is.
He's adapting.

29:49.124 --> 29:50.836
He's adapting to his environment.

29:50.961 --> 29:52.394
He's dealing with the situation.

29:52.505 --> 29:54.250
He's not adapting.
He's shaping it.

29:54.431 --> 29:57.326
Flogging his men.
He's in bed with the Chinese.

29:57.440 --> 29:59.479
Men like Marcus live by a set of rules.

29:59.603 --> 30:00.904
And when those rules break down,

30:01.031 --> 30:02.399
the man breaks down.

30:02.798 --> 30:04.518
Those boys back at the roadhouse,

30:04.684 --> 30:05.904
they just want to be back home.

30:06.014 --> 30:07.668
They want to walk their dogs,
screw their girlfriends,

30:07.783 --> 30:09.234
go to tailgate parties.

30:09.357 --> 30:10.496
You're his friend.

30:10.622 --> 30:12.039
Hell, he loves you like a son.

30:12.172 --> 30:13.697
Forget everything else that I've said

30:13.833 --> 30:15.927
and tell me from your gut
that I'm wrong

30:16.051 --> 30:18.405
and his way is the right path
for those men.

30:18.759 --> 30:20.247
My nation is calling me,

30:20.368 --> 30:22.477
and he's not letting me
answer the call.

30:23.421 --> 30:26.387
And maybe you can't decide.
Maybe that's not who you are.

30:26.697 --> 30:29.873
But I'm asking you
to stay out of the way.

30:30.155 --> 30:32.864
Because this is happening,
one way or the other.

30:34.297 --> 30:36.768
The Secret Service
involvement will be clear.

30:36.905 --> 30:38.860
Our agents will quietly
contain the press pool.

30:38.981 --> 30:42.797
All nonessential personnel will
be vacated from the West Wing.

30:42.927 --> 30:44.361
I'll get you in, and you do
what you have to do,

30:44.471 --> 30:46.309
but the president will be
treated with respect.

30:46.412 --> 30:48.754
The dignity of the office
will be preserved.

30:48.862 --> 30:50.867
Any of your boys
get any ideas, go off book,

30:50.988 --> 30:51.818
they'll be pushed back.

30:51.939 --> 30:53.778
And I can't guarantee
what happens after that.

30:54.374 --> 30:55.264
We'll place the president...

30:55.360 --> 30:56.389
Look, I gave you what you asked for.

30:56.492 --> 30:57.375
I want the rest of my money.

30:57.494 --> 30:58.574
It's time for me to hit the road.

30:58.687 --> 30:59.766
So that's it then?

30:59.875 --> 31:01.436
You're just gonna
take the money and run?

31:01.573 --> 31:02.674
Yeah, pretty much.

31:02.787 --> 31:04.050
I know a kill zone when I see it.

31:04.158 --> 31:05.437
No, no. Forget it!
No, forget it.

31:05.540 --> 31:06.516
You're out of your mind.

31:06.624 --> 31:08.264
Are any of you even listening

31:08.393 --> 31:10.664
to what's being said here out loud?

31:10.775 --> 31:11.800
This is treason.

31:11.908 --> 31:13.994
It's a little late, Tom,
to be getting cold feet.

31:14.102 --> 31:15.726
Now, General, you're in this
whether you like it or not.

31:15.854 --> 31:16.676
Go to hell!

31:16.799 --> 31:18.633
You should've gotten this
together before you called me.

31:18.755 --> 31:20.090
Don't be an ass, Tom.

31:20.223 --> 31:21.526
Stand aside!

31:35.880 --> 31:37.200
Here.

31:43.138 --> 31:45.158
How did you get involved
in all of this?

31:45.280 --> 31:47.597
I found out what the Senator was up to.

31:47.844 --> 31:50.312
Confronted him about it, and he, uh...

31:51.333 --> 31:53.349
slid a gun from his desk,
handed it to me,

31:53.493 --> 31:55.038
and told me to make a choice.

31:56.008 --> 31:56.900
The scariest moment

31:57.028 --> 31:58.389
of my life.

32:00.336 --> 32:02.844
I'm a daughter
of the American Revolution.

32:03.638 --> 32:05.284
I was the, um...

32:05.787 --> 32:08.820
Junior Miss Liberty
in the 4th of July parade.

32:12.378 --> 32:14.471
This is really happening, isn't it?

32:14.640 --> 32:17.396
This is happening
in large part because of you.

32:18.111 --> 32:19.719
Because of what you did,

32:19.840 --> 32:22.338
we have a chance
to make things right again.

32:54.607 --> 32:56.672
Sir, it's me-- Cortez.

32:57.472 --> 32:58.930
Enter.

33:03.229 --> 33:04.627
Come in.

33:07.549 --> 33:09.026
The Bible, Sir?

33:09.350 --> 33:10.878
Mm. It relaxes me.

33:11.443 --> 33:12.975
May I read you something?

33:13.109 --> 33:14.354
Please.

33:15.629 --> 33:17.869
"Blessed are they
which do hunger and thirst

33:17.987 --> 33:19.266
after righteousness,

33:19.424 --> 33:22.023
for they shall be filled
with the spirit of God.

33:22.323 --> 33:23.102
And blessed are those

33:23.217 --> 33:24.963
that are persecuted
for righteousness' sake,

33:25.158 --> 33:27.742
for theirs
is the Kingdom of Heaven."

33:28.270 --> 33:30.214
That's beautiful, Sir.

33:31.018 --> 33:32.689
To me, it's about choice.

33:33.109 --> 33:34.835
Choosing to do the right thing

33:35.010 --> 33:37.246
even though you are alone
in that choice,

33:37.361 --> 33:40.000
and not letting fear of
the unknown cloud your thinking.

33:40.117 --> 33:42.388
Fear that, when the path
becomes too hard to see,

33:42.898 --> 33:44.685
we run back to what we know,

33:45.196 --> 33:49.724
even if what we know
is broken beyond all repair.

33:54.360 --> 33:56.519
Did they send you here to kill me?

33:58.346 --> 34:00.241
Yes, Sir.

34:12.161 --> 34:13.844
Then here we are.

34:16.542 --> 34:18.121
Time to choose.

34:42.217 --> 34:44.465
When the CIA first approached me,

34:45.038 --> 34:46.998
I was finishing up college...

34:47.480 --> 34:49.775
looking at a mountain of student loans.

34:50.728 --> 34:51.989
I was already going into the Navy

34:52.108 --> 34:53.833
'cause they'd picked up
some of the tab.

34:55.072 --> 34:57.827
Langley was offering me
a second paycheck

34:57.953 --> 35:01.306
for something they said
would never happen.

35:02.069 --> 35:05.229
A nuclear sea captain going rogue.

35:06.321 --> 35:09.488
I never wanted to be a spy.

35:11.312 --> 35:14.341
I just wanted to do my job well.

35:15.727 --> 35:16.754
From the day this started,

35:16.871 --> 35:18.985
I didn't know
what I was supposed to do,

35:19.128 --> 35:21.453
who I was supposed to stand by...

35:23.686 --> 35:25.505
who I believed in.

35:27.156 --> 35:29.622
I've made that decision.

35:35.069 --> 35:38.075
I have enemies, Cortez.

35:43.021 --> 35:44.531
I know.

35:45.645 --> 35:47.901
But I am not one of them.

36:04.640 --> 36:06.427
Now that we looked up
each other's skirts,

36:06.550 --> 36:07.572
what do we do,

36:08.493 --> 36:10.599
beat each other to death?

36:17.077 --> 36:18.456
I'm ready.

36:24.145 --> 36:26.505
Marcus isn't dying.
I need to know everything--

36:27.723 --> 36:29.287
what the plan is,

36:29.404 --> 36:30.958
what the crew is thinking,

36:31.313 --> 36:32.578
everything.

36:32.885 --> 36:35.408
Welcome to the deep end of the pool.

36:44.367 --> 36:45.663
Mr. Mayor,

36:45.781 --> 36:47.370
how can I help you?

36:48.816 --> 36:50.389
I have a gift--

36:50.948 --> 36:52.386
American bourbon.

36:52.507 --> 36:53.839
Small batch.

36:54.139 --> 36:55.274
Thank you.

37:00.510 --> 37:01.501
Are you not at least curious

37:01.620 --> 37:03.181
as to how I acquire such things?

37:03.283 --> 37:05.572
That doesn't require
very much imagination.

37:05.667 --> 37:06.925
Yeah, perhaps not.

37:07.028 --> 37:07.974
Either way,

37:08.077 --> 37:10.120
I am the man who gets
things done on this island.

37:10.235 --> 37:12.928
I am confident that Marcus Chaplin

37:13.100 --> 37:14.696
is the man in charge of Sainte Marina.

37:14.805 --> 37:16.533
Well, you might think so.

37:16.821 --> 37:19.840
You might think that you are
here for political reasons,

37:19.949 --> 37:21.238
but you are mistaken.

37:21.345 --> 37:24.026
You're here for me
and what I have to offer you.

37:24.137 --> 37:26.203
You see, there's more to this island

37:26.330 --> 37:27.812
than you can imagine.

37:27.933 --> 37:29.135
Trust me.

37:29.908 --> 37:32.714
I can give you a billion reasons why.

37:32.821 --> 37:34.253
Just give me one.

37:34.904 --> 37:36.879
Rare earth elements.

37:36.996 --> 37:38.633
The oil of the future.

37:40.874 --> 37:42.326
Take this sample.

37:42.593 --> 37:43.770
Test it.

37:44.517 --> 37:46.815
I'm sure you will be very pleased.

38:09.901 --> 38:11.220
Ha!

38:36.842 --> 38:37.826
Sam?

38:38.931 --> 38:39.803
Hi.

38:39.914 --> 38:41.343
Are you all right?

38:41.446 --> 38:42.840
Yeah, I'm okay.

38:43.458 --> 38:44.813
I'm okay.

38:46.761 --> 38:48.543
Look, I, um...

38:48.745 --> 38:50.728
Can I... say something?

38:50.828 --> 38:52.170
Yeah, of course.

38:52.493 --> 38:54.897
You Americans make fun of the French.

38:55.074 --> 38:57.834
We're always on strike,
we missed rock 'n' roll,

38:58.011 --> 38:59.351
Jerry Lewis.

39:00.492 --> 39:03.107
But, you know, we're not, um...

39:04.783 --> 39:07.587
I'm not scared about
difficult feelings.

39:08.284 --> 39:09.745
I don't need the people I care about

39:09.854 --> 39:12.821
to be happy all the time or clear

39:13.220 --> 39:16.314
or know what they want or don't want.

39:16.553 --> 39:18.522
It can be a mess.

39:18.754 --> 39:20.186
We like messy.

39:20.794 --> 39:22.941
Well, if you like messy, I'm your guy.

39:23.928 --> 39:25.858
You're making fun of it, but I'm not.

39:27.298 --> 39:28.843
I am your friend.

39:28.944 --> 39:30.467
You can't stand seeing me.

39:31.006 --> 39:32.543
It doesn't match.

39:32.658 --> 39:33.948
It's okay.

39:35.925 --> 39:38.384
Sophie, are you coming?

39:41.767 --> 39:44.223
Do you know this French saying
from Edith Piaf,

39:44.336 --> 39:45.668
<i>"Je ne regrette rein"?</i>

39:46.694 --> 39:48.022
No.

39:49.520 --> 39:50.984
Okay.

40:07.416 --> 40:09.032
Good to see you, XO.

40:14.482 --> 40:16.150
Good to see you, too, Sir.

40:17.468 --> 40:18.865
You okay?

40:21.417 --> 40:24.096
Look, I don't blame you for
what happened to Christine.

40:25.871 --> 40:27.550
I want you to know that.

40:31.227 --> 40:32.548
You want to talk about it?

40:33.928 --> 40:35.184
No.

40:35.308 --> 40:36.802
I'll let you know when I do.

40:42.212 --> 40:43.993
I missed you out there today.

40:44.625 --> 40:46.597
Thing got pretty hairy, didn't they?

40:46.711 --> 40:49.270
Well, the decisions
are not gonna get any easier.

40:51.003 --> 40:53.068
I need my right hand back.

40:55.324 --> 40:57.645
You want me back, then I'm back.
