00:00.877 --> 00:02.045
<i>Previously on
iZombie...</i>

00:02.253 --> 00:03.338
He must've
taken the cure.

00:03.546 --> 00:05.173
Blaine is having
some issue with his memory.

00:05.465 --> 00:06.424
You can't remember anything.

00:06.633 --> 00:08.134
We know you've been seeing
that gal in the morgue.

00:08.343 --> 00:10.345
This girl's the one good thing
I got in my life.

00:10.887 --> 00:13.473
I told him I didn't want him
working undercover.

00:13.682 --> 00:16.184
I have the right to know if
I'm living with a murderer!

00:16.393 --> 00:17.310
Stop!

00:22.649 --> 00:25.944
Welcome back to Pacific West
University Student Radio.

00:26.152 --> 00:27.612
Tonight, our two candidates

00:27.821 --> 00:29.155
for president of
the student senate

00:29.364 --> 00:31.074
are taking questions
from our listeners.

00:31.282 --> 00:34.619
And our first one comes
from Jenn K, via Twitter,

00:34.828 --> 00:36.788
"Why should I care
about the election?

00:36.997 --> 00:38.289
"Hashtag, real talk."

00:38.498 --> 00:40.667
Bailey, your response?

00:40.875 --> 00:44.546
My first priority is to make
the student senate accessible
to the student body.

00:44.754 --> 00:45.964
As Thomas Paine once said,

00:46.172 --> 00:48.508
"It is not in numbers,
but in unity,

00:48.717 --> 00:50.135
"that our
great strength lies."

00:50.343 --> 00:54.389
Ugh.
There you go again.

00:54.597 --> 00:58.101
First, Jenn,
you sound super-hot.

00:58.309 --> 00:59.811
"Hashtag, let's hang out."

01:00.020 --> 01:02.605
As House of Pain once said,

01:02.814 --> 01:04.649
"Get out your seat,
and jump around."

01:04.858 --> 01:06.401
A stirring rebuttal.

01:06.609 --> 01:08.820
Okay, our next tweet
comes from Jackie.

01:09.029 --> 01:10.822
What the hell was that?

01:11.031 --> 01:13.199
Brody should be
legally required
to wear a helmet.

01:13.408 --> 01:16.619
The first line of his bio
says that he's a, quote,
"ass-o-holic,"

01:16.828 --> 01:18.788
and he just owned you.

01:18.997 --> 01:20.582
Why didn't you drop that bomb?

01:20.790 --> 01:23.626
Because I'm a pacifist.
I gotta go.

01:29.424 --> 01:30.341
What happened?

01:30.550 --> 01:32.093
Let me see, what was it?

01:32.302 --> 01:33.803
Oh, yeah, um...

01:34.012 --> 01:35.847
I accused you of being
the Chaos Killer,

01:36.056 --> 01:37.724
you turned into
a raging zombie,

01:37.932 --> 01:39.017
I tranquilized you.

01:40.894 --> 01:43.021
- How do you feel?
- Honestly? Hungry.

01:44.689 --> 01:46.149
Like, zombie hungry.

01:46.357 --> 01:47.525
I can help with that.

01:47.734 --> 01:49.152
We'll head down
to the morgue soon,

01:49.360 --> 01:50.987
but let's not bury the lead.

01:51.905 --> 01:53.573
You're the Chaos Killer?

01:53.782 --> 01:58.661
Technically,
I'm the "Chaos Kidnapper."

01:58.870 --> 02:01.122
No one is dead,
they're frozen.

02:01.331 --> 02:04.000
In preparation for
their long-haul
interstellar journey?

02:04.209 --> 02:06.211
Okay, Max Rager
knows about zombies.

02:06.419 --> 02:09.214
And they know that
they are, at least, partly,
to blame for them.

02:09.422 --> 02:11.007
They want to get rid
of the evidence.

02:11.216 --> 02:13.927
They identify
potential zombies
through purchases.

02:14.135 --> 02:17.889
Okay, so, hot sauce,
tanning, hair dye.

02:18.098 --> 02:19.849
But there are
hundreds of names.

02:20.058 --> 02:22.811
They learned that
I can detect zombies.

02:23.019 --> 02:25.355
So now they have me
going down the list,

02:25.563 --> 02:28.942
taking out anyone who
sets off my zombie-sense.

02:29.150 --> 02:30.777
Did you consider
turning down their offer?

02:30.985 --> 02:33.863
They said they'd murder
everyone on the list
starting with Liv.

02:35.240 --> 02:38.201
I see.
That's a tough first offer.

02:38.409 --> 02:41.246
I thought that if I could
make Max Rager think
that I was killing them,

02:41.454 --> 02:43.331
freeze them instead,
you could come up with a cure,

02:43.498 --> 02:45.291
and there would be
a big happy ending
for everyone.

02:54.092 --> 02:55.677
We have to tell Liv.

02:55.885 --> 02:57.387
- We can't.
- I'm going to tell her then.

02:57.595 --> 03:00.014
Okay, look,
everything I have done
has been to protect her.

03:00.181 --> 03:02.100
Not to be funny,
but that's what she said.

03:02.308 --> 03:04.435
You see more of Liv
than anyone.

03:04.644 --> 03:07.188
Just answer
this question honestly.

03:07.397 --> 03:09.440
Has she or has she not decided

03:09.649 --> 03:11.776
that the only way she can
make herself feel vital

03:11.985 --> 03:13.945
is to be some crusader
for justice?

03:17.991 --> 03:20.118
It's brought some
meaning to her life,
to be sure.

03:20.326 --> 03:22.203
Okay, then ask yourself,

03:22.412 --> 03:24.664
if we tell Liv the truth,

03:24.873 --> 03:26.374
do you think
this new version of Liv

03:26.583 --> 03:29.085
is liable to do something
that'll get herself killed?

03:31.796 --> 03:33.006
Where is he?

03:33.214 --> 03:34.549
- Ma'am...
- Where's Mr. Boss?

03:36.217 --> 03:37.343
Where is he?

03:37.552 --> 03:39.012
Tell me where Drake is,
or it's your ass.

04:12.921 --> 04:13.880
Mmm.

04:14.923 --> 04:16.883
Tastes nasty...

04:17.091 --> 04:20.136
Oh, but feels great.

04:21.721 --> 04:24.098
So how close are you
to a new cure?

04:24.307 --> 04:27.143
Yeah, about that, um...

04:27.352 --> 04:30.688
I've been successful
turning a zombie rat
back into a normal rat.

04:30.897 --> 04:32.899
So now, it's time to try it
on a two-legged zombie.

04:33.107 --> 04:35.235
A two-legged zombie
has already taken it.

04:35.443 --> 04:36.611
Blaine?

04:37.779 --> 04:40.782
He injected himself before
I could do proper testing.
He thought he was dying.

04:40.990 --> 04:43.660
I know I should want you
to say that the cure
worked perfectly...

04:43.868 --> 04:44.869
Well, he's no longer a zombie.

04:45.078 --> 04:46.412
But...

04:46.621 --> 04:50.208
Side effects may include
complete memory loss.

04:50.416 --> 04:52.460
He's still functional,
still Blaine in many ways.

04:52.669 --> 04:55.046
He just can't recall
anything he did,
or anyone he met,

04:55.255 --> 04:56.381
prior to taking this cure.

04:58.049 --> 04:59.425
Unless, of course he's faking.

05:03.721 --> 05:07.642
- Professor of linguistics?
- That'd be whack, yo.

05:07.850 --> 05:11.271
High school vice principal?

05:11.479 --> 05:13.189
Bluegrass-folk musician.

05:14.399 --> 05:15.608
Sold.

05:17.694 --> 05:18.903
Keeping this one for us.

05:20.363 --> 05:22.907
Hey, champ.
What can we do for you?

05:23.116 --> 05:25.076
I found the Shady Plots
deed of ownership
in my office.

05:25.285 --> 05:26.286
You're Donny, right?

05:26.494 --> 05:28.204
- Don E.
- A-ha.

05:28.413 --> 05:30.164
- And he's Chief?
- Yep.

05:30.331 --> 05:31.708
So who's "John Deaux"?

05:33.501 --> 05:36.212
My <i>nom de guerre.</i>

05:36.421 --> 05:39.257
Why do you need an alias
to own a funeral home?

05:39.465 --> 05:41.217
Don't worry about the deed.

05:41.426 --> 05:42.635
Your job is to upsell
the bereaved.

05:42.844 --> 05:43.720
You got that covered?

05:43.928 --> 05:45.722
Yeah, for the most part.

05:45.930 --> 05:48.099
I can remember
coffin models and prices

05:48.308 --> 05:49.642
like it's
the days of the week,

05:49.851 --> 05:52.145
but when clients come in
from before, I'm lost.

05:52.353 --> 05:54.605
They seem to know me,
but I have no clue
who they are.

05:54.814 --> 05:56.149
Fake it till you make it.

06:03.239 --> 06:05.450
What is it you do down here?

06:05.658 --> 06:08.661
That's downstairs business.
You just concern yourself
with upstairs business.

06:08.870 --> 06:10.538
Division of labor,
Grand Master B.

06:10.747 --> 06:12.248
That's how
productivity happens.

06:16.836 --> 06:19.630
- Somebody's gonna catch us.
- Let's hope.

06:33.144 --> 06:34.437
Stop.

06:34.645 --> 06:35.605
What is that?

06:37.023 --> 06:38.274
Let's find out.

06:55.625 --> 06:57.752
Wake up!

06:57.960 --> 07:00.046
You won't believe
the night I had.

07:00.254 --> 07:03.299
I might.

07:03.508 --> 07:06.844
Liv, I've got something
to tell you.

07:07.053 --> 07:08.096
Drake is a cop.

07:09.222 --> 07:10.264
He what?

07:10.431 --> 07:11.808
An undercover vice detective.

07:12.016 --> 07:13.226
Oh, my God.

07:13.434 --> 07:15.353
That's why he was
working for Mr. Boss.

07:15.561 --> 07:17.397
And Drake's mom
thinks Mr. Boss found out
and had him killed.

07:17.605 --> 07:18.564
Well, what do you think?

07:18.773 --> 07:20.441
I'm not sure.

07:20.650 --> 07:22.944
I just beat the snot
out of one of his goons
trying to get answers,

07:23.152 --> 07:24.320
but he didn't know anything.

07:24.529 --> 07:26.072
- You did what?
- He started it.

07:26.280 --> 07:28.241
- He...
- He tried to manhandle me.

07:28.449 --> 07:29.826
So you went Jack Bauer on him?

07:30.034 --> 07:31.953
Are you mental?

07:32.120 --> 07:34.497
Okay, I might need
to get off stripper brain.

07:34.705 --> 07:36.582
What did you have to tell me?

07:36.791 --> 07:39.419
Oh, right, that.

07:39.627 --> 07:40.545
Um...

07:41.754 --> 07:42.922
Major's a zombie.

07:44.841 --> 07:46.634
Oh, no.

07:46.843 --> 07:47.927
Is he okay?

07:48.136 --> 07:50.680
For now.
He's asleep in my office.

07:50.888 --> 07:55.435
This is not your fault.
You only scratched him
to save his life.

07:55.643 --> 07:58.062
Yeah, and then,
he said he would've rather
I let him die.

07:58.271 --> 07:59.480
I think,
I might have found a way

07:59.689 --> 08:01.941
to tweak his perspective
on that front, for now.

08:02.150 --> 08:06.070
<i>♪ Oh, what a beautiful morning</i>

08:06.279 --> 08:09.449
<i>♪ Oh, what a beautiful day ♪</i>

08:10.450 --> 08:12.368
We're inside.

08:12.577 --> 08:15.788
Well, that is where
the warmest rays of light
come from, inside.

08:15.997 --> 08:17.582
You told her, right?

08:17.790 --> 08:19.375
She would've noticed.

08:19.584 --> 08:21.127
Well, turns out
all I needed was
a little disco nap

08:21.335 --> 08:23.463
to turn my frown upside down.

08:23.671 --> 08:25.923
You know,
being a zombie
ain't so bad.

08:26.132 --> 08:29.469
Leslie Morgan.
You gave him leftover
positivity brain.

08:29.677 --> 08:31.804
I did.
But that was the last of it.

08:32.013 --> 08:36.517
You know that this elevated
mood you're experiencing
is temporary, right?

08:36.726 --> 08:38.436
Look, let's not worry
about tomorrow

08:38.644 --> 08:40.396
until we're done
enjoying today.

08:40.605 --> 08:45.568
Okay, but when this
everything-is-awesome
brain wears off,

08:45.776 --> 08:48.070
- I want you to know
how sorry I am.
- Shh...

08:49.614 --> 08:52.074
Love means never having
to say you're sorry.

08:52.283 --> 08:54.994
I've got hair to dye
and some skin to spray-tan.

08:55.203 --> 08:56.996
Carpe diem!

08:59.081 --> 09:01.792
Can we play hooky
and follow him around
for the rest of the day?

09:06.005 --> 09:08.090
Unfortunately, no.
We've got a body.

09:08.299 --> 09:09.842
Couple skinny-dippers
snuck in last night.

09:10.051 --> 09:11.511
Found her floating,
dead in the pool.

09:11.719 --> 09:14.013
She was strangled to death
with a cord of some sort.

09:14.222 --> 09:16.349
Garroted, like Luca Brasi.

09:16.557 --> 09:19.352
Fitting that she too,
then went to sleep
with the fishes.

09:19.560 --> 09:22.021
It's a Sicilian message.

09:22.230 --> 09:25.191
It means Luca Brasi
sleeps with the fishes.

09:25.399 --> 09:27.735
- That was Don Corleone.
- No it wasn't.

09:27.944 --> 09:29.654
And it was Clemenza
who said that line, anyway.

09:30.905 --> 09:31.989
Victim's friend is here.

09:32.198 --> 09:33.824
Wants to talk to
the detective in charge.

09:36.202 --> 09:37.787
Brody Johnson did this.

09:37.995 --> 09:39.539
Brody from Zeta Beta Theta?

09:39.747 --> 09:41.666
Yeah, beer pong king,
streaking enthusiast,

09:41.874 --> 09:44.710
Johnny Manziel
fan club president,
that Brody.

09:44.919 --> 09:46.921
- You know him?
- We've met.

09:47.129 --> 09:49.048
Why would he want to kill her?

09:49.257 --> 09:51.384
He was running against Bailey
for president of
the student senate.

09:51.592 --> 09:53.719
They must really take
their student government
seriously here.

09:53.928 --> 09:55.721
We found out that Brody
never took his SATs,

09:55.930 --> 09:57.557
he had someone else
do it for him.

09:57.765 --> 09:59.141
Bailey told him that
if he didn't withdraw
from the race,

09:59.350 --> 10:00.268
she was going to
get him expelled.

10:02.728 --> 10:04.564
Anyone else getting
blackmailed by Bailey?

10:04.772 --> 10:06.524
No.

10:06.732 --> 10:08.401
Look, Bailey was
a super-achiever.

10:08.609 --> 10:10.695
She was just a little
hyper-competitive,
hyper-focused.

10:10.903 --> 10:14.740
You put her on a project,
and she could shut
everything else out.

10:14.949 --> 10:16.867
Bailey was gonna kill it
in the real world.

10:17.076 --> 10:19.078
This happens,
and all of that work...

10:20.079 --> 10:21.872
It was all for nothing.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.003
Blood work shows
elevated levels of dextro
and levoamphetamines.

10:27.211 --> 10:28.296
Adderall?

10:28.504 --> 10:30.131
It is used recreationally
by some.

10:30.339 --> 10:32.550
I don't think that's
how Bailey used it.

10:34.427 --> 10:35.595
I wonder if
we would've been friends

10:35.803 --> 10:38.097
if we'd met before
I became a zombie.

10:38.306 --> 10:39.765
Definitely.

10:39.974 --> 10:42.226
Like me for my antidotes,
love me for my anecdotes.

10:42.435 --> 10:45.104
I mean, do you think
you'd still had been
friends with me?

10:45.313 --> 10:46.689
I was a lot like Bailey.

10:46.897 --> 10:49.442
Obsessed with accolades,
grades, accomplishments.

10:49.650 --> 10:50.943
Always wanting
a pat on the head.

10:51.152 --> 10:52.987
Noted. You don't have to
sample Bailey's brains.

10:53.195 --> 10:54.447
We might find you some others.

10:54.655 --> 10:56.532
I think they might help.

10:56.741 --> 10:59.535
Keep me focused on work
and not just freaking out
about Drake.

11:02.622 --> 11:05.916
Hang in there, my gut says
he's gonna resurface.

11:19.513 --> 11:20.973
Mmm, that smells familiar.

11:21.182 --> 11:22.600
Like something
I had in Taiwan,

11:22.808 --> 11:24.518
from a street cart
in the capital city.

11:24.727 --> 11:26.395
Taipei?

11:26.604 --> 11:29.148
Ooh, look at you,
always with the answers.

11:29.357 --> 11:31.067
Work it, live it.

11:31.275 --> 11:32.610
Love it, bro.

11:32.818 --> 11:35.154
Very presidential.

11:35.363 --> 11:39.158
Bro!
Bring it in like Flynn!
Oh...

11:40.493 --> 11:42.953
Mmm, you smell good!

11:43.162 --> 11:45.081
You back here down to pound?

11:45.289 --> 11:47.416
Wanna go back to the house,
play some flip cup,
maybe touch bits?

11:47.625 --> 11:48.876
Not even a little.

11:49.043 --> 11:51.462
- This isn't a social call.
- Oh, hey, dude.

11:55.341 --> 11:56.842
Doesn't mean
it can't become one, right?

11:57.051 --> 11:58.636
You never know where
the night's gonna take you.

11:58.844 --> 12:00.763
Did last night
take you to the pool?

12:00.971 --> 12:04.183
Oh, the Bailey thing.
Two murders in one year.

12:04.392 --> 12:05.559
What are the odds?

12:05.726 --> 12:08.062
Campaign had to
totally switch gears.

12:08.270 --> 12:10.022
What do you think?

12:10.231 --> 12:13.734
"Brody Johnson.
Your best and only choice."

12:13.943 --> 12:15.528
- Goosebumps.
- Yeah.

12:15.736 --> 12:17.113
Do any of your
talking points address

12:17.321 --> 12:21.158
why you had someone else
take your SATs for you?

12:21.367 --> 12:23.619
Okay, first of all,
the SATs are
culturally biased.

12:23.828 --> 12:25.663
It's a fact.

12:25.871 --> 12:28.124
And B,
are multiple-choice tests
even within your jurisdiction?

12:28.332 --> 12:29.875
No, but murder is.

12:30.084 --> 12:32.712
We know Bailey threatened
to expose your academic fraud.

12:32.920 --> 12:34.130
That gives you motive.

12:36.048 --> 12:37.591
Oh, you think I killed her?

12:37.800 --> 12:39.885
Oh.

12:40.094 --> 12:43.013
Yeah, no. No, I did not.
I did not kill her.

12:43.222 --> 12:44.598
Bro, come on. It's me.

12:44.807 --> 12:46.684
The only thing
I've murdered is ass.

12:48.728 --> 12:51.731
Besides, Bailey was
never gonna go through
with that threat.

12:51.939 --> 12:53.733
Why not?

12:53.941 --> 12:56.777
Same reason Russia
never tried to nuke us.

12:56.986 --> 12:59.405
Mutually assured destruction.

13:01.073 --> 13:04.410
C Plus in 20th Century
American History, what?

13:04.618 --> 13:06.078
Well, we had dirt on her, too.

13:06.287 --> 13:08.247
My bro's cousin's
girlfriend's roommate

13:08.456 --> 13:10.750
saw her getting busted
selling Addy.

13:10.958 --> 13:14.378
But the school pulled strings,
got the charges dropped.
Bailey was their golden girl.

13:14.587 --> 13:16.881
Where were you last night,
after the radio debate?

13:17.089 --> 13:18.883
Me and Austin
were having a D and M.

13:23.763 --> 13:26.432
A deep and meaningful?

13:26.640 --> 13:28.434
You know,
like when you grab
a bottle of whiskey

13:28.642 --> 13:32.021
and you just walk
and talk about life.

13:32.229 --> 13:34.023
True story, bro.

13:34.231 --> 13:36.233
You two went on a walk?
That's what you're going to
go with?

13:37.985 --> 13:39.862
What's with the tone, bro?

13:41.280 --> 13:42.406
You've changed.

13:45.910 --> 13:48.370
<i>What did you do today?
Watch TV?</i>

13:48.579 --> 13:51.290
<i>Surf the web? Do your laundry?</i>

13:51.499 --> 13:53.793
<i>What do you wish
you would've done instead?</i>

13:54.001 --> 13:56.003
<i>We could all use
a little extra kick sometimes.</i>

13:56.754 --> 13:58.422
<i>Life's a bitch.</i>

13:58.631 --> 14:00.424
<i>This is the slap.</i>

14:01.425 --> 14:03.511
<i>Super Max.</i>

14:06.180 --> 14:08.224
<i>You're welcome!</i>

14:08.432 --> 14:13.938
<i>♪ Live to the Max,
Super Max! ♪</i>

14:14.146 --> 14:15.439
<i>Super Max!</i>

14:17.858 --> 14:19.109
<i>Whoo!</i>

14:19.318 --> 14:21.237
That's Rob Thomas.

14:21.445 --> 14:24.073
I mean, there's
something so compelling
about the stuff he writes.

14:24.281 --> 14:26.033
And on a related note,

14:26.242 --> 14:27.910
did you know that
you were conceived
at a Santana concert?

14:31.288 --> 14:32.414
Oh, get over it.

14:38.420 --> 14:42.216
Let me out of here.

14:42.424 --> 14:45.594
Yeah, I can't, pumpkin.
I can't.

14:45.803 --> 14:47.888
You're a threat
to human existence.

14:49.265 --> 14:50.891
And, more importantly, to me.

14:51.100 --> 14:53.769
You know what,
just try to enjoy
a little R and R,

14:53.978 --> 14:56.313
while we're trying
to find a cure.

14:56.522 --> 14:57.898
Oh, that's your plan?

14:58.774 --> 15:00.317
To cure me.

15:00.526 --> 15:03.070
It's my top priority.

15:03.279 --> 15:05.406
I mean, after
the Super Max launch.

15:05.614 --> 15:11.328
But once that's done,
it's all hands on deck to make
you back into a redhead.

15:11.537 --> 15:14.373
Oh, and you did like
the ad though, right?

15:16.166 --> 15:18.544
Knew it. Be good.

15:30.764 --> 15:32.933
You're Drake Holloway's
girlfriend, right?

15:33.142 --> 15:35.477
Liv Moore.
Looking for Detective Vega.

15:35.686 --> 15:38.731
He's not here.
I'm his better half.

15:38.939 --> 15:40.274
Lou Benedetto.

15:41.817 --> 15:43.527
I spoke to Drake's mother,
yesterday.

15:43.736 --> 15:46.822
I'm sorry that's how
you had to find out that
he was undercover.

15:47.031 --> 15:48.324
We're doing everything
we can to find him.

15:48.532 --> 15:50.534
Does it help for you
to know that

15:50.743 --> 15:52.786
the last time I saw Drake,
he was getting into a car
with Stacey Boss?

15:52.995 --> 15:55.664
Hey, I thought we were
meeting at Homicide
and coming over together.

15:55.873 --> 15:58.000
Oh, sorry.
I thought we said
we'd meet here.

15:58.208 --> 16:00.002
Detective Benedetto?
Clive Babineaux. Homicide.

16:00.210 --> 16:01.712
Yeah, Babineaux.

16:01.921 --> 16:04.089
You're on quite a hot streak,
solving case after case.

16:04.298 --> 16:06.508
No, it takes a village.

16:06.717 --> 16:10.846
Bailey Barker. Strangled.
Left floating in the PWU pool.

16:11.055 --> 16:14.183
A witness claims she was
busted for selling Adderall,
but her record's clean.

16:14.391 --> 16:17.811
PWU is your stomping grounds,
ring any bells?

16:18.020 --> 16:21.106
A CI caught her on a wire,
a couple months ago.

16:21.315 --> 16:23.233
I put a little scare in her
and I set her free.

16:23.442 --> 16:25.653
She was one of those kids...

16:25.861 --> 16:28.530
Your life will be ruined.

16:28.739 --> 16:30.574
You want to spend
the next 10 years in jail?

16:34.244 --> 16:35.955
So that was that?

16:36.163 --> 16:38.374
You don't think
she was caught up
in some drug thing?

16:38.582 --> 16:41.085
No, she was just a kid
who wanted to study longer
and harder than anyone else.

16:41.293 --> 16:43.379
All right, thank you.

16:43.587 --> 16:45.547
It was more than
a little scare.

16:45.756 --> 16:49.093
Benedetto was telling Bailey
he was going to ruin her life.

16:49.301 --> 16:51.887
Wasn't scary enough
to keep her off the Addy,
though.

16:52.096 --> 16:53.639
But we might have a lead here.

16:53.847 --> 16:56.016
The school sent over
Bailey's records.

16:56.225 --> 16:57.142
I had a look.

16:59.103 --> 17:00.187
Babineaux.

17:00.396 --> 17:03.315
<i>Edward Burgain,
from the Pac-West
Student Newspaper.</i>

17:03.524 --> 17:05.859
<i>I'm looking to confirm
that Brody Johnson
is a leading suspect</i>

17:06.026 --> 17:08.195
<i>in the murder
of Bailey Barker.</i>

17:08.404 --> 17:09.738
<i>Detective Babineaux?</i>

17:09.947 --> 17:11.782
- Liv...
<i>- Okay, I get it.</i>

17:11.991 --> 17:14.827
<i>I won't quote you,
but I just need
official confirmation.</i>

17:15.035 --> 17:17.079
<i>Tell you what,
I'll count down from five.</i>

17:17.287 --> 17:19.707
<i>If you hang up
before I get to zero,
I'll assume it's true.</i>

17:20.416 --> 17:22.167
<i>Five...</i>

17:22.376 --> 17:24.086
What are you doing?

17:24.294 --> 17:25.921
You asked me
to go through
Bailey's records.

17:26.130 --> 17:27.047
No, I didn't.

17:28.132 --> 17:29.591
I already did that.

17:29.800 --> 17:31.885
Look at the charges
on Bailey's meal card.

17:32.094 --> 17:34.763
There's one from
the student union snack bar
the night she died.

17:34.972 --> 17:36.473
Oh, we should
check that out tomorrow.

17:40.269 --> 17:42.312
I've mapped out
every possible route
Bailey could've taken

17:42.521 --> 17:44.231
from the student union
to the pool.

17:44.398 --> 17:45.566
Here.

17:47.526 --> 17:49.945
How long did this take you?

17:50.154 --> 17:53.907
If you flip the overlay,
these are the crimes committed
over the past four years.

17:54.116 --> 17:55.784
That's a lot of initiative.

17:55.993 --> 17:58.120
Save some of that material
for my performance review.

17:59.288 --> 18:01.331
This is comprehensive.

18:01.540 --> 18:03.667
Idle brains are
the devil's workshop.

18:03.876 --> 18:05.044
I think it's "hands."

18:05.252 --> 18:06.420
What'd I say?

18:06.628 --> 18:08.547
So, on those
performance review forms,

18:08.756 --> 18:12.468
do you just circle
"exceeds expectations"
for everything, or...

18:12.676 --> 18:14.970
I think Ravi handles...

18:15.179 --> 18:16.096
What the...

18:19.767 --> 18:24.521
"Detective Clive Babineaux
confirmed his investigation is
focused on Brody Johnson."

18:24.730 --> 18:26.607
No, I didn't.

18:26.815 --> 18:29.151
"Unnamed sources within
the Seattle PD classify

18:29.359 --> 18:33.322
"Babineaux as a lone wolf
with a real Serpico complex."

18:33.530 --> 18:35.449
"Unnamed sources"?

18:35.657 --> 18:37.534
Hey, can I help you?

18:37.743 --> 18:39.828
Bailey Barker visited
here two nights ago,
sometime after 10:00.

18:40.037 --> 18:41.288
The murdered girl?

18:41.497 --> 18:43.373
- Were you working that night?
- Yeah.

18:43.582 --> 18:45.793
Yeah, it was just me,
but she never came in here.

18:46.001 --> 18:47.920
Her meal card
was charged here.

18:48.128 --> 18:51.340
Look, sometimes when
people's cards are maxed,
they use a friend's.

18:51.548 --> 18:52.466
We're not supposed
to let them,

18:52.674 --> 18:54.510
but come on,
what do we care?

18:54.718 --> 18:56.470
You're saying someone else
used Bailey's meal card
that night?

18:57.054 --> 18:58.555
Who?

18:58.764 --> 19:00.307
I'm pretty sure
it was that guy.

19:07.523 --> 19:09.441
We should verify
Brody's alibis.

19:09.650 --> 19:11.276
I've already reached out
to most of them.

19:12.027 --> 19:14.321
Everything okay?

19:14.488 --> 19:16.406
Why? Did I do something wrong?

19:16.615 --> 19:19.034
Not exactly,
you're the opposite
of distracted.

19:19.243 --> 19:21.161
Your efficiency
is kind of scaring me.

19:22.704 --> 19:24.581
I've been seeing this guy.

19:24.790 --> 19:27.417
Okay, guy stuff.
Makes sense.
Enough said.

19:28.544 --> 19:31.338
His name is Drake Holloway.

19:31.547 --> 19:33.799
He's a cop.
An undercover vice cop.

19:34.007 --> 19:35.759
Okay, that can be tough.

19:35.968 --> 19:38.178
- But you really
shouldn't share that with...
- He's missing.

19:38.387 --> 19:41.056
I'm freaking out and
I'm trying to focus on work,
so that I don't fall apart.

19:42.766 --> 19:44.810
You hang in there, Liv.

19:45.018 --> 19:46.353
There were a couple times
when I was undercover,

19:46.562 --> 19:49.356
when no one heard
from me for weeks.

19:49.523 --> 19:51.567
I'll bet he's okay.
I'm glad you told me.

19:52.901 --> 19:54.528
Detective?

19:55.571 --> 19:57.781
Detective Babineaux, right?

19:57.990 --> 19:59.408
I saw your picture
in the paper.

19:59.616 --> 20:01.076
I was going to come
down to the station,

20:01.285 --> 20:02.744
- but since
you're already here...
- What can I do for you?

20:02.953 --> 20:06.707
Is it true you're the Serpico
at your precinct?

20:06.915 --> 20:09.835
- The guy nobody likes?
- So true.

20:10.043 --> 20:12.004
This is Liv Moore,
from the medical
examiner's office.

20:12.212 --> 20:13.172
She works with me.

20:16.800 --> 20:18.427
I know who killed
Bailey Barker.

20:19.344 --> 20:21.221
Okay. Who?

20:21.430 --> 20:23.390
It's a vice detective.
Bald guy.

20:24.766 --> 20:26.018
His name is Benedetto.

20:35.360 --> 20:37.279
Let me get this straight.

20:37.487 --> 20:39.406
You're accusing
a Seattle police department
detective of murder?

20:40.866 --> 20:42.993
Yeah. That's exactly
what I'm doing.

20:45.662 --> 20:49.333
Look, a few months back
I got busted for trying
to buy Utopium, okay.

20:49.541 --> 20:50.667
The next thing I know,
Benedetto's telling me

20:50.876 --> 20:52.336
that if I don't want
to go to jail,

20:52.544 --> 20:53.670
I have to work for him as
a confidential informant.

20:53.879 --> 20:54.755
He doesn't have
that authority.

20:54.963 --> 20:56.715
Tell him that.

20:56.924 --> 20:58.967
He says,
I have to do six drug buys,
while wearing a wire.

20:59.176 --> 21:00.928
He gave me
a bunch of cash to use.

21:01.136 --> 21:02.679
He said,
once I do six buys,
he'll get my charges dropped.

21:02.888 --> 21:04.348
I don't know six drug dealers.

21:04.556 --> 21:06.350
But I had
Latin-American Policy
with Bailey.

21:06.558 --> 21:08.185
I'd see her popping Adderall
every day before class.

21:08.393 --> 21:11.063
So during finals,
I said, "I need to cram."

21:11.271 --> 21:12.773
I offer her
a couple of twenties
for a couple pills.

21:12.940 --> 21:14.066
She says, "Sure."

21:14.274 --> 21:15.859
And that's how
Bailey got arrested.

21:16.068 --> 21:17.611
I'm sure Benedetto
gave her the same deal.

21:21.198 --> 21:22.658
When I heard she was dead,

21:22.866 --> 21:26.536
I told him I wanted out,
or I'd go above his head.

21:26.745 --> 21:27.913
He told me,
I'd better not talk to anyone,

21:28.121 --> 21:29.331
unless I wanted
to end up like Bailey.

21:33.001 --> 21:34.419
Thank you, buddy.

21:34.628 --> 21:37.089
Now, um, what informant
did you say this was?

21:37.297 --> 21:38.674
- We didn't.
- FB DeMouy?

21:39.675 --> 21:40.842
Kevin McCabe?

21:41.051 --> 21:42.469
You run a lot of CI's at PWU?

21:42.678 --> 21:44.096
You got a judge
signing off on those?

21:44.304 --> 21:45.514
Back when I was in Vice...

21:45.722 --> 21:47.766
Yeah, I've heard stories
about your days in Vice.

21:48.892 --> 21:50.185
Before you were run out.

21:51.561 --> 21:52.521
Well...

21:53.563 --> 21:54.523
Look...

21:56.984 --> 21:59.903
You can choose to believe me,
a fellow cop,

22:00.112 --> 22:01.405
or somebody I busted.

22:01.613 --> 22:03.573
But since you won't tell me
what kid it is,

22:03.782 --> 22:07.661
I can't set you straight
on what evil deed
he or she is guilty of.

22:08.745 --> 22:10.956
But, let me make this clear,

22:11.164 --> 22:14.376
I'm not worried
about study drugs.

22:14.584 --> 22:18.547
My focus is on
whoever's flooding Seattle
with Lucky U.

22:18.755 --> 22:20.507
"Lucky U"? Any leads?

22:20.716 --> 22:22.592
Not yet.

22:22.801 --> 22:24.219
We caught a dealer last month.

22:24.428 --> 22:26.054
I thought he was higher up
the food chain,

22:26.263 --> 22:28.515
but he must've been
getting high off
his own supply.

22:28.724 --> 22:30.058
What makes you say that?

22:32.853 --> 22:34.646
He was looking at 20 years.

22:36.523 --> 22:38.442
But we offered him
this sweet deal,
if he just rolled over,

22:38.650 --> 22:40.610
and told us who
he was working for.

22:40.819 --> 22:42.821
This dumb ass starts shaking.

22:43.030 --> 22:44.448
He's terrified.

22:44.656 --> 22:47.284
He finally says, "No deal,
I'd rather do the time."

22:47.492 --> 22:48.785
And we figured,
if this guy's getting
so scared,

22:48.994 --> 22:50.329
we must be getting closer.

22:50.537 --> 22:52.247
We push him harder
and he finally blurts out...

22:55.625 --> 22:57.878
"I can't man, I can't.

22:58.045 --> 23:03.216
"I work for zombies, man.
Flesh-eating zombies, man!"

23:05.886 --> 23:08.972
Zombies.
I have officially
heard it all.

23:09.639 --> 23:11.308
Zombies?

23:11.516 --> 23:13.894
Yeah. So I've still got
a lot of work to do.

23:19.566 --> 23:20.650
Can I help you?

23:21.651 --> 23:23.028
So that's it?

23:24.321 --> 23:25.572
We're done?

23:26.406 --> 23:28.617
Umm... I hope not?

23:30.619 --> 23:33.747
I'm sorry.
I was sick recently,

23:33.955 --> 23:35.957
and the remedy
seems to have affected
my memory.

23:36.166 --> 23:39.836
Look, I don't know
if this amnesia bit is real,
or just your latest con.

23:40.045 --> 23:42.130
Either way, you're costing me
my case against Mr. Boss.

23:42.339 --> 23:43.590
Which, I guess,
is just as well,

23:43.799 --> 23:46.134
since Liv said this
was all a ploy.

23:46.343 --> 23:49.388
Just to get the DA's office
to pave the way for you to be
Seattle's new drug kingpin.

23:51.640 --> 23:52.599
Yeah.

23:54.684 --> 23:58.355
You know, you've told me
you've done awful things.

23:58.563 --> 24:01.483
That getting
Mr. Boss sent away was
your chance to atone.

24:03.693 --> 24:04.820
Who's Mr. Boss?

24:31.138 --> 24:33.723
Blaine,
Blaine, Blaine...

24:33.932 --> 24:35.725
I'm trying to be patient,
dude, I really am.

24:35.934 --> 24:37.185
But we all have our limits.

24:37.394 --> 24:40.105
And frankly,
you're starting to test mine.

24:40.313 --> 24:42.524
- What is all this?
- None of your concern.

24:42.732 --> 24:44.234
We talked about this.

24:44.443 --> 24:46.695
Are you starting to lose your
short-term memory, too?

24:46.903 --> 24:50.740
We can get your body
covered in reminder tattoos,
like that dude from <i>Memento.</i>

24:50.949 --> 24:55.912
No, no. I'm good. Sorry.

25:01.084 --> 25:03.420
Orange juice, 16 ounces.

25:03.628 --> 25:05.505
Where to put it?

25:10.427 --> 25:12.095
- Ms. Moore.
- Oh, God, is Drake...

25:12.304 --> 25:13.555
No, no, nothing new on Drake.

25:13.763 --> 25:15.640
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to scare you.

25:15.849 --> 25:18.393
I know, I should've called,
but I just wanted
to talk in person.

25:18.602 --> 25:21.438
Bailey was working for me,
as a CI.

25:21.646 --> 25:22.898
It's a long story.

25:23.106 --> 25:25.025
I can tell it from out here,
if you want.

25:25.233 --> 25:27.194
No, of course, come on in.

25:32.115 --> 25:33.617
Anyone I bust
on a misdemeanor

25:33.825 --> 25:35.535
gets offered
the standard deal.

25:35.744 --> 25:38.288
If they help me
make six arrests,
I drop the charges.

25:38.497 --> 25:40.081
But Bailey was
a bit of an overachiever.

25:40.290 --> 25:42.876
She kept talking about
making a big buy.

25:43.084 --> 25:45.295
Did Bailey have
anything set up
the night she died?

25:45.504 --> 25:47.005
If she did,
she didn't tell me.

25:47.214 --> 25:48.798
Why couldn't you tell me this
back in front of Clive?

25:49.007 --> 25:51.301
'Cause I need
this program kept quiet.

25:51.510 --> 25:53.470
And your partner doesn't have
the best reputation in Vice.

25:53.678 --> 25:55.805
You heard him talking
about running everything
through a judge.

25:56.014 --> 25:57.724
- Clive is a great cop.
- Just what I hear.

26:00.727 --> 26:02.354
Wanna know what
people say about you?

26:02.562 --> 26:03.980
What?

26:04.189 --> 26:05.899
That you're the real deal.

26:06.107 --> 26:09.444
That you'll be running
your own morgue
before you're 35.

26:11.238 --> 26:13.156
Liv,

26:13.365 --> 26:14.866
the fewer people in the loop,

26:15.075 --> 26:17.202
the safer it is
for our people.

26:17.410 --> 26:19.496
People like Drake.

26:19.704 --> 26:23.458
I've got all our agents
listening for anything that
might lead us to him.

26:23.667 --> 26:26.378
I'm here asking you not to put
my program in jeopardy.

26:28.046 --> 26:30.048
Okay, I get it.

26:30.924 --> 26:32.634
But Clive...

26:32.842 --> 26:34.135
I'm sure he's great,
but can we keep
the circle small?

26:35.262 --> 26:36.846
Any progress on your end?

26:38.014 --> 26:40.016
We've had mostly dead-ends.

26:40.225 --> 26:41.476
We're looking at
Brody Johnson,

26:41.685 --> 26:42.811
the guy running against Bailey

26:43.019 --> 26:45.272
in the student senate
presidential election.

26:45.480 --> 26:47.023
He's got motive,

26:47.232 --> 26:49.192
plus the guy
running the register at
the university snack bar

26:49.401 --> 26:52.070
said that Brody used
Bailey's meal card
the night she died.

26:52.279 --> 26:53.863
Looks like he was mistaken,
though.

26:54.072 --> 26:56.032
- Brody's alibi checks out.
- Got it.

26:56.241 --> 26:58.410
You mind keeping me
in the loop?

26:58.618 --> 27:00.662
I mean, just as it
would affect my CI's,

27:00.870 --> 27:02.872
and help me keep them safe?

27:03.081 --> 27:06.418
- Will do.
- Thank you.

27:06.626 --> 27:10.422
Breakfast taco truck
was out of migas,
so I got you a vegetarian.

27:10.630 --> 27:12.716
Sweet. What'd you get?

27:12.924 --> 27:14.384
Chorizo and bacon.

27:24.728 --> 27:26.187
"Background check
authorization,

27:27.522 --> 27:29.691
"Federal Bureau
of Investigation."

27:31.151 --> 27:32.777
How did that get there?

27:32.986 --> 27:35.614
For what it's worth,
I think you'd make
a hell of an FBI agent.

27:35.822 --> 27:37.282
Seattle PD doesn't
appreciate you.

27:37.490 --> 27:38.575
You clear cases like
Frank Drebin,

27:38.783 --> 27:40.201
but they treat you
like Nordberg.

27:40.410 --> 27:42.621
And, you know...

27:44.080 --> 27:46.374
I'm not going to be
around here forever.

27:46.583 --> 27:49.085
Once the Chaos Killer case
is solved,

27:49.294 --> 27:51.212
it's back to Virginia for me.

27:52.088 --> 27:53.214
My taco.

27:58.011 --> 28:02.432
Well, if it isn't
Blaine-John-DeBeers-McDonough
- Deaux-Jingleheimer-Schmidt.

28:03.600 --> 28:05.644
Here to confess?

28:05.852 --> 28:08.021
Ah, I was just looking
for the morgue.

28:08.229 --> 28:09.689
Picking up, or dropping off?

28:11.191 --> 28:12.567
I'm sorry, have we met?

28:23.870 --> 28:25.372
I'm not seeing any
post-concussion red flags.

28:25.580 --> 28:26.706
But if your memory loss
persists,

28:26.915 --> 28:29.250
you should get
an MRI, or a CT scan.

28:29.459 --> 28:30.543
Maybe a PET scan.

28:30.752 --> 28:32.629
Anything with
an acronym, really,

28:32.837 --> 28:34.631
just as long as
it tests brain function.

28:34.839 --> 28:36.216
Sounds good, Doc.

28:40.178 --> 28:42.097
Why's this guy coming to you
for checkups?

28:42.305 --> 28:46.976
Oh, he was in last week
on funeral home business.

28:47.185 --> 28:48.395
And said he suffered
a head trauma,

28:48.603 --> 28:50.355
and was complaining
about memory loss.

28:50.563 --> 28:53.525
I think, I might be
the only doctor
he can remember.

28:56.236 --> 28:59.030
He's faking.
I don't know why, but he is.

28:59.239 --> 29:01.449
- The man's dangerous.
- Oh, he is?

29:01.658 --> 29:03.243
Take my word for it.

29:03.410 --> 29:04.703
Keep an eye on him.

29:11.042 --> 29:12.711
What to do with you...

29:12.919 --> 29:15.588
I really seem to inspire
negative reactions in people.

29:15.797 --> 29:17.257
Was it something I said?

29:17.465 --> 29:19.592
- More like the, things
you've done.
- Such as?

29:19.801 --> 29:21.177
How much time have you got?

29:23.972 --> 29:25.473
And that about covers it.

29:26.015 --> 29:27.684
Oh.

29:27.892 --> 29:29.853
You also murdered
the fourth man
to walk on the moon.

29:30.061 --> 29:32.272
One assumes,
his brain fetched a tidy sum.

29:32.480 --> 29:34.023
And you picked
a fight with me once.

29:34.232 --> 29:36.276
Don't worry about it, though.
I won.

29:36.484 --> 29:37.902
None of this makes sense, man.

29:38.111 --> 29:38.945
I don't know, I'm scrappy.

29:39.154 --> 29:40.739
- I've got reach.
- Right.

29:42.490 --> 29:43.783
This is important, Blaine.

29:43.992 --> 29:45.410
If you're drawing
a complete blank,

29:45.618 --> 29:47.620
who is delivering brains
to Seattle's zombies?

29:47.829 --> 29:49.038
I don't know.
That's downstairs stuff.

29:49.247 --> 29:51.207
- The boss is handling that.
- "The boss"?

29:51.416 --> 29:53.960
How could I have done
all of these horrible things?

29:54.169 --> 29:55.712
My guess?

29:55.920 --> 29:57.881
If a child
lives with ridicule,
he learns to hate.

30:00.049 --> 30:02.635
Yeah, um...

30:02.844 --> 30:04.012
Remember how
I was telling you

30:04.220 --> 30:06.264
about that guy,
whose life you ruined?

30:06.473 --> 30:08.558
You know, how you turned
his fiance into a zombie,
then cost him his job,

30:08.767 --> 30:11.311
killed a bunch of kids
that were close to him,
kidnapped him,

30:11.519 --> 30:12.645
locked him in a freezer
and tortured him,

30:12.854 --> 30:14.314
before finally
stabbing him to death?

30:14.522 --> 30:15.440
Yeah, this is him.

30:16.149 --> 30:17.150
Hey.

30:20.653 --> 30:23.031
I thought the worst part
about this whole thing

30:23.239 --> 30:26.034
was forgetting
the people I loved,

30:27.243 --> 30:28.703
or the people that loved me.

30:30.997 --> 30:32.457
But maybe nobody did.

30:32.665 --> 30:36.377
You know, who we were
isn't who we are.

30:36.586 --> 30:38.713
It's practice
for who we want to become.

30:38.922 --> 30:39.881
Huh.

30:41.758 --> 30:44.135
I should go. Thanks, Doc.

30:53.520 --> 30:57.649
I wouldn't wish that on...
Well, him.

30:57.857 --> 30:59.275
You know, because
he's my worst enemy.

30:59.484 --> 31:00.360
You get it.

31:00.568 --> 31:01.778
Listen, Major.

31:01.986 --> 31:03.696
What happened to Blaine
might not happen to you.

31:03.905 --> 31:06.366
I know.
He could totally be faking.

31:06.574 --> 31:07.826
You know,
and even if it is the truth,

31:08.034 --> 31:09.786
it's not like
I don't have other options.

31:09.994 --> 31:12.247
I mean, I don't have
to take this new cure.

31:12.455 --> 31:14.207
I'm sorry, but I think you do.

31:14.415 --> 31:15.708
I mean,
if you don't want to die.

31:15.917 --> 31:16.793
Whoa, hold on now.

31:17.001 --> 31:18.503
I mean, New Hope died.

31:18.711 --> 31:20.046
She's a rat.

31:20.213 --> 31:21.923
Last time I checked, Gepetto,
I'm a real boy.

31:22.131 --> 31:24.843
So, I might be more resilient.

31:25.051 --> 31:27.053
You might.
But I wouldn't bet
the farm on it.

31:27.262 --> 31:29.931
Look, if I take
the second cure,
and I survive,

31:30.139 --> 31:32.725
but I have
no idea who you are,
no idea who Liv is,

31:32.934 --> 31:36.020
if I don't even know who I am,
what's the point?

31:36.229 --> 31:37.730
I mean, whose life is it
I'll be saving?

31:39.983 --> 31:41.901
You know what we need?

31:42.110 --> 31:43.444
A talking rat.

31:43.653 --> 31:44.612
Then we'll know
if Blaine's telling the truth.

31:48.157 --> 31:50.743
Ravi, you magnificent bastard,
that's it!

31:50.952 --> 31:52.161
I hope that
whatever's got you excited

31:52.370 --> 31:53.663
doesn't require me
to build some

31:53.872 --> 31:55.415
- rat mind-reading device.
- No, no, no.

31:55.623 --> 31:56.958
Vaughn can be
our talking rat.

31:57.166 --> 31:58.585
Uh...

31:58.793 --> 32:00.503
Look, look, I scratch him,
turn him into a zombie.

32:00.712 --> 32:02.213
We give him the cure.

32:02.422 --> 32:05.300
If he doesn't lose his memory,
we know Blaine's lying.

32:05.508 --> 32:07.552
And if he does
lose his memory, well,

32:07.760 --> 32:09.345
maybe the upside is

32:09.554 --> 32:12.265
he becomes
a harmless shell of himself,
like Blaine.

32:12.473 --> 32:13.766
I mean, there are
some ethical hurdles

32:13.975 --> 32:15.059
I need to get
my head around...

32:15.268 --> 32:16.769
He's planning on
killing Liv and me

32:16.936 --> 32:20.106
as soon as I'm done
with that zombie list.

32:20.273 --> 32:23.401
Okay, ethical hurdles cleared.
I'll go prepare a syringe.

32:37.457 --> 32:40.919
So, no word from Drake, huh?

32:41.127 --> 32:43.963
Our cupboards had no
organizational efficiency.

32:44.172 --> 32:45.798
One thing just led to another.

32:46.007 --> 32:48.343
- Permission to open fridge?
- Granted.

32:51.220 --> 32:52.931
None for me.
I need to stay sharp.

32:53.932 --> 32:55.183
Suit yourself.

32:57.268 --> 33:00.647
I made a map
and an inventory sheet.

33:00.855 --> 33:02.982
I'll laminate the map,
but not the inventory.

33:03.191 --> 33:04.609
We'll need to update that
as it changes.

33:05.443 --> 33:07.320
Ah, old Liv.

33:07.528 --> 33:09.906
Don't let anyone tell you
the girl doesn't know
how to party.

33:11.407 --> 33:13.534
Because you do.
You do know how to party.

33:13.743 --> 33:16.371
I've never even seen
that much Lucky U.

33:16.579 --> 33:18.331
But, uh, from what I hear,

33:19.999 --> 33:22.043
there's the guy
that can get it for you.

33:25.672 --> 33:28.549
Hey, you're back.

33:28.758 --> 33:30.426
Yeah, but I gotta go.

33:31.469 --> 33:34.305
Sorry about the mess.

33:34.514 --> 33:37.642
Okay.
But don't eat a new brain,
until this is dealt with.

33:44.065 --> 33:45.108
Clive!

33:47.694 --> 33:49.195
I had a vision.

33:49.404 --> 33:52.031
Bailey was trying to buy
a boatload of Lucky U.

33:52.240 --> 33:54.033
From Steve,
the snack bar cashier.

33:54.826 --> 33:56.202
Bailey was a CI.

33:56.411 --> 33:57.787
- But Benedetto said...
- Benedetto lied.

33:57.996 --> 33:59.497
- What makes you so sure...
- He told me.

34:00.665 --> 34:01.791
I'm sorry.

34:03.543 --> 34:06.045
He showed up at my door,
acted really nice.

34:06.254 --> 34:09.340
He told me
I was destined for big things,
used me for information.

34:09.549 --> 34:11.551
I used to be so desperate
to impress people.

34:11.759 --> 34:14.303
I was like a praise-oholic.

34:14.512 --> 34:16.764
I thought I was past that,
but apparently not.

34:16.973 --> 34:20.226
He made it sound like
by not telling you about Drake
I was somehow protecting him.

34:20.393 --> 34:22.228
But I don't think that
that's really the case.

34:23.563 --> 34:25.732
Do I not praise you enough?

34:25.940 --> 34:29.027
Temporary insanity,
that's all it was.

34:30.611 --> 34:32.447
I'm done with old me.

34:32.655 --> 34:34.907
You can trust me
with almost anything.
You should know that.

34:35.116 --> 34:36.034
I do.

34:37.035 --> 34:40.079
- "Almost any..."
- Wait.

34:40.288 --> 34:43.666
If Bailey was making
a big buy from Steve,
and he pats her down...

34:43.875 --> 34:46.002
- Discovers the wire...
- Uses it to strangle her.

34:46.210 --> 34:49.338
Let's go check in
on Steve Walsh.

34:49.547 --> 34:52.759
Honestly, dude.
I thought the re-up
was tomorrow.

34:57.638 --> 34:59.223
I'll get rid of whoever it is.

35:08.483 --> 35:11.110
Hi-dilly-ho, Steve!

35:11.319 --> 35:13.613
How long did you think you
could work undercover for me
as my CI,

35:13.780 --> 35:15.698
while you sold Lucky U
under my nose, hmm?

35:15.907 --> 35:17.241
Hey, just chill, man!

35:18.493 --> 35:20.161
Most of my CI's,

35:20.369 --> 35:21.788
once they got me
their six busts,

35:21.996 --> 35:23.372
I never see them again.

35:23.581 --> 35:26.459
You, you just kept going,
didn't you?

35:26.667 --> 35:29.295
You never could find
anyone selling Lucky U,

35:29.504 --> 35:32.673
but you sure as hell
helped me take down a lot
of Utopium dealers, huh?

35:33.466 --> 35:34.425
Huh?

35:36.302 --> 35:37.428
No.

35:37.637 --> 35:38.638
They were your competition,
right?

35:38.805 --> 35:40.473
No, no, no, no. I sw...

35:40.681 --> 35:42.475
Look...

35:42.683 --> 35:45.770
I know Bailey
came looking for you
the night she died.

35:45.978 --> 35:48.189
The way I figure,
she wasn't looking to buy
a slice of pizza.

35:48.397 --> 35:52.026
No, someone told her
that you were the guy,
the man.

35:52.235 --> 35:54.487
And she set up a buy,
and she wore a wire.

35:54.695 --> 35:56.948
Just like the wire
you wear for me.

35:57.156 --> 35:58.783
And that's how you knew
to look for it.

35:58.991 --> 36:00.159
And that's when
you strangled her...

36:00.368 --> 36:01.619
You don't know anything!

36:03.788 --> 36:06.999
Oh, I got news for you, Steve.

36:07.166 --> 36:09.794
The money Bailey was gonna use
to buy your Lucky U,

36:10.002 --> 36:12.922
the money you stole from her
after you killed her,

36:13.131 --> 36:15.508
those were marked bills.

36:15.716 --> 36:17.760
Guess what's gonna
happen to you when
I find that money?

36:17.969 --> 36:18.886
Save me some time.

36:19.095 --> 36:21.347
Tell me where you've got it.

36:21.556 --> 36:22.765
I'll tell the DA
you cooperated.

36:24.684 --> 36:26.644
- It's in the kitchen.
- Where?

36:26.853 --> 36:28.187
In the cookie jar
in the kitchen.

36:28.396 --> 36:29.438
Cookie jar.

36:41.033 --> 36:42.201
Get me out of these, man.

36:42.410 --> 36:43.703
They know I killed that girl.

36:43.870 --> 36:45.538
I gotta disappear
before more cops show up.

36:55.381 --> 36:56.966
Hey, you think
that cop's dead?

37:22.992 --> 37:28.372
Vice cop found unconscious
near handcuffed killer whose
neck's been snapped.

37:28.581 --> 37:30.625
Yeah, you might have
to walk me through this one.

37:33.502 --> 37:35.421
Your vic, Bailey,
was one of my CIs.

37:35.588 --> 37:36.589
So you lied to us about that.

37:39.050 --> 37:43.012
An informant told me that
they saw Bailey with Steve
the night she died.

37:43.221 --> 37:44.305
Steve was one of my CIs.

37:44.513 --> 37:46.140
He helped me make
a lot of Utopium busts.

37:46.349 --> 37:49.810
So many,
that I wondered if
he was playing me,

37:50.019 --> 37:51.646
actually working for
the guys behind Lucky U.

37:51.854 --> 37:53.606
And I came over here
to confront him.

37:53.814 --> 37:55.691
And it turns out,
I'm not so bad at my job,
I was right.

37:55.900 --> 37:56.943
But unbeknownst to me,

37:57.151 --> 37:58.736
Bailey was trying
to set him up.

37:58.945 --> 38:00.071
She didn't know he was a CI.

38:00.279 --> 38:01.405
He found the wire on her

38:01.614 --> 38:02.740
and he used it
to strangle her.

38:04.617 --> 38:06.744
- He admitted all of this?
- Yeah, he did.

38:06.953 --> 38:08.329
That's when I cuffed him.

38:08.537 --> 38:10.039
Did you find any marked bills?

38:10.248 --> 38:11.457
About $3,000 worth.

38:11.666 --> 38:12.959
Run them,
they were issued to Bailey.

38:13.167 --> 38:14.335
That's what I was looking for,

38:14.543 --> 38:16.337
after I put Steve
in bracelets.

38:16.545 --> 38:18.297
But I got kissed
by a freight train.

38:19.507 --> 38:20.800
Can you describe
your assailant?

38:22.677 --> 38:23.719
Massive fist.

38:26.180 --> 38:27.848
Man, that's about all I got.
I don't...

38:28.057 --> 38:30.142
You're running
an unauthorized CI program,

38:30.351 --> 38:32.770
putting kids with
no experience or training
in danger.

38:32.979 --> 38:35.356
It's all going in my report.

38:35.564 --> 38:37.817
Look, Bailey's death
was tragic and I have
to live with that.

38:38.025 --> 38:40.695
But my CI program
gets drugs off the streets.

38:40.903 --> 38:42.280
It saves lives.

38:42.488 --> 38:44.323
You shut it down,
you're putting kids in danger.

38:44.532 --> 38:46.158
Oh, that's what
you care about,
Benedetto?

38:46.367 --> 38:47.285
These kids?

38:49.620 --> 38:51.330
You know what?

38:51.539 --> 38:54.375
I don't care
what everyone says,
Babineaux, I like you.

38:54.583 --> 38:56.210
Then, my life is complete.

38:56.419 --> 38:58.713
Yeah, holier than thou.
It's very appealing.

38:58.921 --> 39:00.881
Keep doing what you're doing.

39:01.090 --> 39:02.842
Internal Affairs
can take it from here.

39:05.386 --> 39:08.556
You're going to need backup
someday, Babineaux.

39:08.764 --> 39:10.683
Fingers crossed
it gets there in time.

39:29.618 --> 39:31.954
Hey, there's a woman
in the waiting area.

39:32.163 --> 39:35.875
Says she's not leaving until
she talks to the FBI agent
running the Chaos Killer case.

39:43.257 --> 39:45.259
Agent Bozzio, FBI.
You wanted to see me?

39:49.430 --> 39:52.099
I think I know who
the Chaos Killer is.

39:52.308 --> 39:53.768
What makes you think that?

39:55.686 --> 39:57.521
I know this dog.

39:59.815 --> 40:01.942
Start at the beginning.

40:02.151 --> 40:03.402
I work at a pet groomer's.

40:03.611 --> 40:05.488
This dog was there
a couple weeks ago.

40:05.696 --> 40:07.156
But the guy who
brought him in

40:07.365 --> 40:08.949
came to get him
before I was done.

40:09.158 --> 40:11.452
He was all sweaty,
freaking out.

40:11.660 --> 40:14.455
He said he stole the dog
from a cop who abused it,

40:14.663 --> 40:16.415
and the cop
was coming back
to get him.

40:16.624 --> 40:17.833
- What cop?
- I don't know.

40:18.042 --> 40:20.002
No cop ever showed up.

40:20.211 --> 40:24.131
But, it says here
that the dog was found on
a city bus the same day

40:24.340 --> 40:26.175
that guy came to grab him
from the shop.

40:27.343 --> 40:28.969
Do you remember his name?

40:29.178 --> 40:30.971
Yeah, Major Lilywhite.

40:37.478 --> 40:41.399
<i>Non.
Oui, mais je suis le patron.</i>

40:41.607 --> 40:44.068
<i>Rappelez-moi,
quand c'est fait.
Adieu.</i>

40:47.238 --> 40:48.864
Ready to do this thing?

40:49.073 --> 40:50.616
If not now,
I'll never will be.

40:58.290 --> 40:59.959
He has a storage shed.

41:00.167 --> 41:01.293
Really?

41:08.759 --> 41:11.512
You know what?

41:11.720 --> 41:14.140
I think we're going to
put the gym on hold, Major.

41:15.891 --> 41:18.727
Take a little trip to Tacoma,
instead.

41:18.936 --> 41:20.980
There's something down there
I need you to see.

41:22.940 --> 41:24.692
Okay.

41:24.900 --> 41:27.653
I'm just gonna
put my bag in my car.
I'll be right back.

41:33.784 --> 41:34.869
Stop!

41:35.077 --> 41:36.078
Turn around.

41:38.497 --> 41:40.332
Down on the ground.
Hands behind your back.

41:43.210 --> 41:44.795
Down.
