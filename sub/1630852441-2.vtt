<i>-And we're counting on a real good time</i>
<i>-Maths is so much fun</i>

00:24.000 --> 00:24.833
All right!

00:24.916 --> 00:27.041
<i>-Maths Party!</i>
<i>-Everyone</i>

00:27.125 --> 00:29.291
<i>-Party!</i>
<i>-Maths is fun</i>

00:29.375 --> 00:30.625
<i>We're the babies</i>

00:30.708 --> 00:32.083

00:32.166 --> 00:35.416

<i>One, two, three, let's go</i>

00:36.416 --> 00:37.750
<i>Maths Party!</i>

00:37.833 --> 00:39.833
<i>The party's just begun</i>

00:39.916 --> 00:45.250
<i>-And we're counting on a real good time</i>
<i>-This party is number one!</i>

00:45.333 --> 00:46.833
<i>Maths Party!</i>

00:54.916 --> 00:59.958
Welcome to Chef Franny's
Frantastic Food Show!

01:00.041 --> 01:01.750
Yay! Franny!

01:01.833 --> 01:06.000
And this is my helper, Tilly the Taster!

01:06.083 --> 01:09.000
Yay! Tilly!

01:09.083 --> 01:14.833
Today is very special<i>,</i>
because today we are making

01:14.916 --> 01:16.750
cupcakes!

01:17.250 --> 01:19.208
I love cupcakes!

01:19.291 --> 01:23.166
Let's look at our ingredients.

01:23.250 --> 01:27.666
Ingredients are the things
you need to make the cupcakes.

01:28.916 --> 01:30.208
Cookitybot!

01:31.375 --> 01:33.125
Hello, Cookitybot.

01:35.041 --> 01:37.875
Well, it looks like we need

01:37.958 --> 01:39.708
a special cupcake mix,

01:39.791 --> 01:41.791
and one egg,

01:41.875 --> 01:44.208
and a carton of milk.

01:44.291 --> 01:46.791
And noodles!

01:48.750 --> 01:52.333
There aren't any noodles
in cupcakes, Lulu.

01:52.416 --> 01:55.708
Well, just a little noodle?

01:55.791 --> 01:58.875
Nope. It's just cupcake mix and--

01:58.958 --> 02:00.666
One noodle?

02:00.750 --> 02:04.458
Why do you want noodles in these cupcakes?

02:04.541 --> 02:07.416
Well, because…

02:08.833 --> 02:12.083
<i>-I love noodles</i>
<i>-Noodles!</i>

02:12.166 --> 02:15.166
<i>In the day, in the night</i>
<i>Give me oodles and oodles</i>

02:15.250 --> 02:16.666
<i>-Of noodles</i>
<i>-Noodles!</i>

02:16.750 --> 02:18.083
<i>-I love noodles</i>
<i>-Noodles!</i>

02:18.166 --> 02:21.166
<i>I got to dance, got to dance</i>
<i>Yes, yes, yes</i>

02:21.250 --> 02:24.208
<i>I love to dance</i>
<i>Got to dance about the thing I love best</i>

02:24.291 --> 02:26.583
<i>-And that's noodles</i>
<i>-Noodles!</i>

02:26.666 --> 02:27.750
<i>-Noodles</i>
<i>-Noodles!</i>

02:27.833 --> 02:31.208
<i>-I move like a noodle</i>
<i>-Watch her wiggle</i>

02:31.291 --> 02:34.208
<i>-Every time I wiggle</i>
<i>-We start to giggle</i>

02:34.291 --> 02:35.875
<i>-My noodle</i>
<i>-Our noodle!</i>

02:35.958 --> 02:37.666
<i>-My noodle</i>
<i>-Her noodle</i>

02:37.750 --> 02:40.666
<i>In a bowl or a cup, I like to slurp 'em up</i>

02:40.750 --> 02:42.250
<i>Noodles</i>

02:42.333 --> 02:43.833
<i>-I love noodles</i>
<i>-Noodles!</i>

02:43.916 --> 02:46.833
<i>In the day, in the night</i>
<i>Give me oodles and oodles</i>

02:46.916 --> 02:48.333
<i>-Of noodles</i>
<i>-Noodles!</i>

02:48.416 --> 02:49.916
<i>-I love noodles</i>
<i>-Noodles!</i>

02:50.000 --> 02:52.916
<i>I got to dance, got to dance</i>
<i>Yes, yes, yes</i>

02:53.000 --> 02:56.125
<i>I love to dance</i>
<i>Got to dance about the thing I love best</i>

02:56.208 --> 02:58.208
<i>-And that's noodles</i>
<i>-Noodles!</i>

02:58.291 --> 02:59.750
<i>-Noodles</i>
<i>-Noodles!</i>

02:59.833 --> 03:01.166
<i>Noodles!</i>

03:02.166 --> 03:06.416
So, to make noodle-less cupcakes…

03:07.750 --> 03:10.750
we need one cupcake mix…

03:12.041 --> 03:14.291
Cookity, if you please.

03:18.083 --> 03:19.750
…one egg…

03:24.833 --> 03:27.291
and one carton of milk.

03:36.416 --> 03:38.000
You ready, Cookity?

03:46.125 --> 03:47.833
He's mixing!

03:50.000 --> 03:51.791
He's cooking!

03:54.666 --> 03:56.166
I can smell them!

04:02.083 --> 04:04.958
It's so beautiful!

04:05.666 --> 04:11.541
Oh no. This is only one cupcake.
There's not enough for all of us.

04:12.125 --> 04:13.791
It's enough for me!

04:15.625 --> 04:17.250
-No!
-Huh?

04:17.333 --> 04:21.250
We each need a cupcake.
I have to make more.

04:22.375 --> 04:27.625
Why don't you guys go play in the playroom
while I keep cooking with Tilly?

04:27.708 --> 04:28.541
Okay.

04:30.833 --> 04:35.375
Welcome to the Super Silly Restaurant,

04:35.458 --> 04:38.666
where all the food is pretend

04:39.375 --> 04:40.916
except for dessert.

04:42.166 --> 04:45.583
Would you like some pretend apples?

04:46.083 --> 04:48.333
-Here you go.
-Lulu's hungry.

04:53.833 --> 04:54.833
Kip!

04:54.916 --> 04:59.166
This apple tastes like a banana!

05:00.458 --> 05:05.000
-Oh no! Not the banana apple!
-Yes.

05:05.083 --> 05:09.166
-I'll get you another one right away.
-Thank you.

05:10.333 --> 05:11.916
Try this.

05:16.833 --> 05:21.333
Kip, this apple tastes like a carrot.

05:22.125 --> 05:25.541
Oh no! A carrot apple?

05:25.625 --> 05:27.583
-Yeah.
-That's worse!

05:28.125 --> 05:29.958
Cupcakes are all done.

05:31.250 --> 05:32.625
Thanks, Cookity.

05:35.541 --> 05:36.875
Let's go, Tilly.

05:39.083 --> 05:44.125
I don't want any more pretend food.
I want real food.

05:47.166 --> 05:49.166
The cupcakes!

05:51.416 --> 05:54.583
This time it has to be the right number.

05:56.833 --> 05:59.041
A cupcake for Bailey.

05:59.583 --> 06:00.416
Hello!

06:00.500 --> 06:04.291
-A cupcake for Kip.
-They look so good!

06:04.375 --> 06:06.958
A cupcake for Tilly.

06:10.583 --> 06:14.708
-A cupcake for me.
-Yeah…

06:15.833 --> 06:18.041
No cupcake for Lulu?

06:19.750 --> 06:22.583
I made a cupcake mistake!

06:24.000 --> 06:26.791
I need to make the right number
of cupcakes

06:26.875 --> 06:29.458
for the right number of babies.

06:29.541 --> 06:31.583
What… "Number"?

06:32.166 --> 06:34.958
I think we have a maths problem.

06:36.250 --> 06:39.375
Maths Molly!

06:42.083 --> 06:44.458
There she is. Come on!

06:45.541 --> 06:48.125
Come on, big kids! I need your help.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.083
<i>The babies are here</i>
<i>to use maths to solve a problem.</i>

06:52.166 --> 06:58.791
We need to know how many babies we are
so that I know how many cupcakes to make.

07:04.208 --> 07:06.833
How many babies is that, big kids?

07:08.125 --> 07:09.125
<i>One.</i>

07:09.791 --> 07:12.833
That's right! Just Tilly.

07:16.666 --> 07:19.000
Now how many babies are there?

07:20.791 --> 07:21.958
<i>Two.</i>

07:22.041 --> 07:23.916
Yep. One, two.

07:27.708 --> 07:31.791
Oh, there's me! How many babies is that?

07:33.750 --> 07:34.833
<i>Three.</i>

07:34.916 --> 07:36.375
Yeah!

07:36.458 --> 07:39.791
One, two, three.

07:39.875 --> 07:42.708
Three babies.

07:47.500 --> 07:49.250
How many babies now?

07:52.125 --> 07:53.416
<i>Four.</i>

07:54.625 --> 07:58.875
One, two, three, four.

07:58.958 --> 08:00.166
Four babies.

08:01.708 --> 08:04.250
But I'm not in the picture.

08:07.500 --> 08:09.333
Oh there I am!

08:09.416 --> 08:11.958
How many babies are there now?

08:14.375 --> 08:15.375
<i>Five.</i>

08:17.041 --> 08:20.250
That means I need five cupcakes.

08:20.333 --> 08:21.875
Because there are--

08:22.666 --> 08:27.625
one, two, three, four, five--

08:28.875 --> 08:30.791
five babies!

08:31.375 --> 08:34.333
Counting is very tricky.

08:34.416 --> 08:35.250
Yeah.

08:37.041 --> 08:38.583
Where are you going?

08:40.208 --> 08:41.333
<i>Yī.</i>

08:43.041 --> 08:44.208
<i>Èr.</i>

08:45.375 --> 08:46.541
<i>Sān.</i>

08:49.458 --> 08:50.750
<i>Sì.</i>

08:52.500 --> 08:53.791
<i>W.</i>

08:57.166 --> 09:02.041
Did Tilly just count to five in Mandarin?

09:02.125 --> 09:03.125
Good job, Tilly.

09:03.208 --> 09:06.291
And now we can eat cupcakes!

09:06.375 --> 09:08.541
-Yeah!
-Stop!

09:09.125 --> 09:10.958
First, a…

09:11.041 --> 09:14.333
Maths Party!

09:17.541 --> 09:18.958
<i>We did it! We did it!</i>

09:19.041 --> 09:20.458
<i>We did maths</i>

09:20.541 --> 09:22.625
<i>We went down the maths path</i>

09:23.541 --> 09:26.458
<i>We stopped to think the problem out</i>

09:26.541 --> 09:29.916
<i>Now it's time to jump and shout</i>

09:30.000 --> 09:30.833
Yeah!

09:30.916 --> 09:32.541
<i>We did it! We did it!</i>

09:32.625 --> 09:33.958
<i>We did maths</i>

09:34.041 --> 09:36.125
<i>We went down the maths path</i>

09:36.958 --> 09:39.625
<i>Maths makes you a supersmartie</i>

09:39.708 --> 09:44.458
<i>So we had a big Maths Party</i>

09:44.541 --> 09:47.083
<i>We did it! We did it! We did maths</i>

09:47.166 --> 09:50.458
<i>We love maths!</i>

09:54.458 --> 09:56.583
These cupcakes are yummy!

09:56.666 --> 09:59.791
Well, these cupcakes don't have noodles.

10:03.750 --> 10:05.833
But I love them!

10:08.125 --> 10:14.833
I'm just happy we finally have
five cupcakes for five babies.

10:14.916 --> 10:20.125
Yeah. And I'm so happy that I'm hoppy!

10:20.208 --> 10:21.208
Me too!

10:21.833 --> 10:24.916
-We're five babies hopping!
-Yeah!

10:26.416 --> 10:29.541
Let's play the five babies game.

10:29.625 --> 10:33.583
Where we hop, hop, hop
and bop, bop, bop!

10:34.166 --> 10:35.291
Come on!

10:35.791 --> 10:37.333
<i>Five babies hopping</i>

10:37.416 --> 10:39.708
<i>Hop-hop-hopping round a tree</i>

10:40.583 --> 10:42.791
<i>Kip hop-hoppity hops away</i>

10:42.875 --> 10:44.916
Look! A bumblebee!

10:45.458 --> 10:49.458
<i>Four babies tapping</i>
<i>Tap-tap-tapping on our knees</i>

10:50.375 --> 10:54.958
<i>Let's all get a snack in</i>
<i>Pass the ice cream please</i>

10:55.041 --> 10:57.166
<i>Tilly leaves to take a bath</i>

10:57.250 --> 10:59.125
<i>Now we're only three</i>

10:59.833 --> 11:03.958
<i>Three babies skipping</i>
<i>Skip-skip-skipping on their toes</i>

11:04.458 --> 11:08.625
<i>Skipping round the garden</i>
<i>Bailey stops to smell a rose</i>

11:08.708 --> 11:13.708
<i>So now there's two babies sliding</i>
<i>Slide-slide-sliding down a slide</i>

11:14.208 --> 11:18.208
<i>-Lulu keeps on sliding</i>
<i>-Franny takes off for a ride</i>

11:18.291 --> 11:19.125
See you later!

11:19.208 --> 11:23.166
<i>One baby dancing</i>
<i>Dance with Raffe round the room</i>

11:23.666 --> 11:27.666
<i>Everybody join the fun</i>
<i>So I'm not the only one</i>

11:27.750 --> 11:28.583
Come on!

11:28.666 --> 11:32.875
<i>One, two, three, four, five</i>
<i>Count everyone</i>

11:33.416 --> 11:37.791
<i>-Five, four, three, two, one</i>
<i>-And now we're done</i>

11:41.208 --> 11:46.166
Thanks for helping me count today,
big kids. You're smart.

11:46.250 --> 11:48.791
Just like Franny.

11:51.208 --> 11:53.666
-Love you!
-Bye-bye-bye!

12:00.875 --> 12:04.416
<i>Kip is playing explorer today,</i>
<i>finding animals.</i>

12:04.500 --> 12:07.708
I'm the best animal finder around.

12:07.791 --> 12:09.958
And Tilly's helping.

12:11.750 --> 12:13.458
Tilly loves taking pictures.

12:13.541 --> 12:15.291
-<i>Xiào!</i>
-Smile, big kids!

12:16.000 --> 12:20.166
Okay, now. We have to be very, very quiet

12:20.250 --> 12:25.375
because we are looking
for the singing blue elephant.

12:27.166 --> 12:29.291
He's near! Let's go find him!

12:31.125 --> 12:34.208
Tilly! Oh boy.

12:34.833 --> 12:38.250
There he is. The blue elephant.

12:38.333 --> 12:41.750
Let's see if we can get a closer look.

12:50.916 --> 12:51.750
Tilly.

12:56.125 --> 12:57.291
Peek-a-pop!

12:58.416 --> 13:01.833
-Oh, we did it! We found you!
-You did?

13:01.916 --> 13:05.041
Yeah, we were finding animals,
and we found you.

13:08.958 --> 13:11.916
I didn't know I was hiding, but good job.

13:12.000 --> 13:12.833
Yeah.

13:13.833 --> 13:16.708
Hey, look. We found Clickety Clock too.

13:16.791 --> 13:17.625
<i>Xiào.</i>

13:18.375 --> 13:20.291
-Let's go catch him!
-Okay.

13:20.916 --> 13:21.875
Come on.

13:23.583 --> 13:24.458
Get it!

13:24.541 --> 13:25.875
Got it!

13:25.958 --> 13:28.375
And get it!

13:28.458 --> 13:29.708
Got it!

13:31.458 --> 13:32.791
Clickety Clock's here.

13:32.875 --> 13:34.916
We got you, Clickety Clock!

13:35.000 --> 13:37.291
What time is it, big kids?

13:41.416 --> 13:43.833
<i>Time to play inside.</i>

13:47.291 --> 13:49.708
We should take the bubble train.

13:51.041 --> 13:53.041
I think Tilly wants to race us.

13:54.208 --> 13:56.250
Let's race her!

13:56.333 --> 14:00.000
-Yeah. Let's race.
-All aboard the bubble train!

14:00.083 --> 14:02.375
<i>-Woo-hoo!</i>
<i>-It's time for a ride</i>

14:02.458 --> 14:04.000
<i>Woo-hoo!</i>

14:04.083 --> 14:06.541
<i>-Feeling happy inside</i>
-<i>Woo-hoo!</i>

14:06.625 --> 14:08.208
<i>We're moving on</i>

14:08.291 --> 14:10.666
<i>Sing with the bubbles</i>
<i>It's a bubble train song</i>

14:10.750 --> 14:11.958
<i>Woo-hoo!</i>

14:12.041 --> 14:13.333
<i>Places to go</i>

14:13.416 --> 14:14.791
<i>Woo-hoo!</i>

14:14.875 --> 14:16.041
<i>-Go fast</i>
<i>-Or slow</i>

14:16.125 --> 14:17.333
<i>Woo-hoo!</i>

14:17.416 --> 14:18.833
<i>We're moving on</i>

14:18.916 --> 14:21.583
<i>Sing with the bubbles</i>
<i>It's a bubble train song</i>

14:21.666 --> 14:24.208
<i>It's great to travel in time and space</i>

14:24.291 --> 14:25.500
<i>-Bopping</i>
<i>-And singing</i>

14:25.583 --> 14:26.708
<i>From place to place</i>

14:26.791 --> 14:28.000
<i>Woo-hoo!</i>

14:28.083 --> 14:29.541
<i>We're moving on</i>

14:29.625 --> 14:32.000
<i>Sing with the bubbles</i>
<i>It's a bubble train song</i>

14:32.083 --> 14:33.291
<i>I'm up front</i>

14:33.375 --> 14:34.666
<i>Me, caboose</i>

14:34.750 --> 14:37.375
<i>-Let's pop the bubbles</i>
<i>-The bubbles are loose</i>

14:37.458 --> 14:38.500
<i>Woo-hoo!</i>

14:38.583 --> 14:40.208
<i>We're moving on</i>

14:40.291 --> 14:42.958
<i>Sing with the bubbles</i>
<i>It's a bubble train song</i>

14:43.041 --> 14:45.125
<i>Sing with the bubbles</i>
<i>It's a bubble train song</i>

14:45.208 --> 14:46.875
<i>Woo-hoo!</i>

14:53.166 --> 14:56.291
-Hi, Tilly!
-You won, Tilly.

14:56.375 --> 14:59.041
You were faster than the bubble train.

15:00.250 --> 15:01.916
<i>Wán?</i>

15:02.000 --> 15:05.125
Yes, Tilly, time to "play."

15:05.208 --> 15:07.541
Now, what should we play?

15:08.458 --> 15:09.958
Let's play hide-and-seek!

15:10.541 --> 15:12.166
Yeah!

15:12.250 --> 15:14.000
-I'm good at hiding.
-Yeah.

15:14.083 --> 15:17.375
And I'm the best at finding so I'll be it.

15:17.458 --> 15:20.333
I'll count to five, and you all hide.

15:20.416 --> 15:21.541
Okay.

15:21.625 --> 15:25.541
-Come on, Tilly. Let's play.
-I'm gonna hide over here.

15:27.208 --> 15:29.250
Okay, I'm going to start counting!

15:29.333 --> 15:30.166
Tilly!

15:31.125 --> 15:32.541
-One…
-Maybe over here.

15:32.625 --> 15:33.458
…two,

15:34.291 --> 15:35.125
three,

15:35.916 --> 15:36.750
four,

15:37.583 --> 15:38.416
five.

15:39.708 --> 15:42.416
Ready or not, here I come!

15:44.250 --> 15:47.291
I found Lulu and Tilly.

15:47.375 --> 15:50.208
Wow. I am really good at this.

15:50.291 --> 15:54.666
Wait. It's not fair.
We weren't ready. Start again.

15:55.541 --> 15:56.916
What's going on?

15:57.000 --> 15:58.833
We couldn't hide.

15:58.916 --> 16:02.041
Kippie needs to count more numbers.

16:02.125 --> 16:04.166
Well, I counted to five.

16:04.250 --> 16:09.916
But five wasn't enough
so count to a higher number, like ten.

16:10.708 --> 16:12.708
-Yes. Count to ten.
-Ten?

16:12.791 --> 16:17.375
Okay. Well, I can do that.
That's as easy as a wallaby hop.

16:17.458 --> 16:19.458
Okay, counting to ten.

16:20.166 --> 16:21.875
One, two, ten!

16:22.833 --> 16:25.208
Found you! I win again!

16:25.291 --> 16:31.083
But, Kip, you have to count
all the numbers between one and ten.

16:31.875 --> 16:34.541
Right. Okay. I can do this.

16:35.125 --> 16:36.583
Everybody hide again.

16:37.166 --> 16:43.041
One, two, three, four, five…

16:45.250 --> 16:46.250
Five…

16:47.416 --> 16:49.166
What comes after five?

16:49.250 --> 16:51.125
Five-teen. No.

16:51.916 --> 16:53.750
Five… Five-ten?

16:55.083 --> 16:58.541
Five kamillion jillion billion?
That's crazy.

17:08.500 --> 17:10.375
Hello?

17:16.791 --> 17:19.916
Sorry, Franny. I didn't mean to scare you.

17:21.291 --> 17:24.375
We're still hiding from Kip.

17:24.458 --> 17:25.291
<i>Shì.</i>

17:27.666 --> 17:30.666
Where <i>is</i> Kip? He should be here by now.

17:30.750 --> 17:35.333
Well, maybe we're just really good
at hiding.

17:36.125 --> 17:38.666
I don't think we're that good.

17:38.750 --> 17:41.750
-Maybe we should check on Kip.
-Yeah.

17:42.958 --> 17:46.500
I still think I'm really good at hiding.

17:46.583 --> 17:48.250
And so is Tilly.

17:49.208 --> 17:52.166
Katrillion! No. Gazillion! No.

17:52.250 --> 17:54.166
A million gazillion! No.

17:54.250 --> 17:55.500
Kippie!

17:55.583 --> 17:58.083
Kip, you're not counting right.

17:58.166 --> 18:00.583
-I'm not?
-No.

18:00.666 --> 18:04.750
Well, let's play a different game, then.
One without counting.

18:04.833 --> 18:07.083
No counting? Why not?

18:07.166 --> 18:11.333
Well, I just don't want to.
I… It's not fun.

18:11.416 --> 18:15.000
But, Kip, you love hide-and-seek.

18:15.083 --> 18:17.708
I know. I do.

18:17.791 --> 18:22.125
But it's… I just don't remember
how to count all the way to ten.

18:22.208 --> 18:24.916
You don't? But it's easy!

18:25.000 --> 18:28.666
It's one, two, three, four, five…

18:28.750 --> 18:30.416
I forgot the rest.

18:32.166 --> 18:33.125
Maths Molly?

18:33.208 --> 18:35.208
-Oh yeah! Yeah!
-Yeah!

18:35.291 --> 18:37.958
Maths Molly!

18:38.750 --> 18:40.000
She can help me.

18:40.666 --> 18:43.041
-There she is!
-There she is!

18:43.125 --> 18:45.375
I'm going to get you, Molly!

18:45.458 --> 18:48.541
<i>The babies are here</i>
<i>to use maths to solve a problem.</i>

18:48.625 --> 18:51.375
We need your help
so we can play hide-and-seek.

18:55.208 --> 18:59.208
First, we need to count to five.
We know how to do that.

18:59.291 --> 19:06.208
One, two, three, four, five!

19:06.916 --> 19:09.791
But what comes after five?

19:09.875 --> 19:12.250
Can you help us do the rest, big kids?

19:13.375 --> 19:19.958
<i>Six, seven, eight, nine, ten!</i>

19:21.916 --> 19:26.875
Nice job!<i> </i>Now, can you help me
count all the numbers at once?

19:29.041 --> 19:33.833
<i>One, two, three, four, five,</i>

19:33.916 --> 19:38.083
<i>six, seven, eight, nine, ten!</i>

19:41.000 --> 19:44.291
-Now we can play hide-and-seek!
-Oh yeah!

19:44.375 --> 19:48.000
But first, a Maths Party!

19:49.458 --> 19:50.875
<i>We did it! We did it!</i>

19:50.958 --> 19:52.375
<i>We did math</i>s

19:52.458 --> 19:54.541
<i>We went down the maths path</i>

19:55.458 --> 19:58.375
<i>We stopped to think the problem out</i>

19:58.458 --> 20:01.833
<i>Now it's time to jump and shout</i>

20:01.916 --> 20:02.750
Yeah!

20:02.833 --> 20:04.458
<i>We did it! We did it!</i>

20:04.541 --> 20:05.875
<i>We did maths</i>

20:05.958 --> 20:08.041
<i>We went down the maths path</i>

20:08.875 --> 20:11.541
<i>Maths makes you a supersmartie</i>

20:11.625 --> 20:16.375
<i>So we had a big Maths Party</i>

20:16.458 --> 20:19.000
<i>We did it! We did it! We did maths</i>

20:19.083 --> 20:22.083
<i>We love maths!</i>

20:24.041 --> 20:29.083
I'm going to count to ten now,
and I'm going to count silly.

20:30.791 --> 20:33.250
Okay.<i> </i>One,

20:33.333 --> 20:36.333
two, three,

20:36.416 --> 20:38.916
four,

20:39.500 --> 20:45.625
five, six, seven…

20:46.416 --> 20:47.416
Uh-oh.

20:48.291 --> 20:49.458
Seven…

20:50.458 --> 20:51.291
Uh-oh.

20:51.375 --> 20:54.708
What comes after seven?
Everyone, come back!

20:55.583 --> 20:57.750
Okay. What?

20:58.541 --> 21:02.375
I was counting silly, so I forgot again.

21:02.458 --> 21:06.666
Well, what if we put it in a song?
Would that help?

21:06.750 --> 21:09.916
Yeah! A counting song!

21:10.000 --> 21:12.166
Counting!

21:12.750 --> 21:16.000
-Great idea! Let's go!
-Yeah!

21:16.083 --> 21:16.916
Come on!

…five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

22:15.750 --> 22:16.791
I did it.

22:17.875 --> 22:21.250
Ready or not, here I come!

22:24.291 --> 22:25.750
Found you, Franny.

22:29.625 --> 22:31.041
Found you, Bailey.

22:33.375 --> 22:34.875
Good finding, Kip.

22:37.333 --> 22:39.458
Found you, Lulu and Tilly.

22:39.541 --> 22:41.666
-You did!
<i>-Shì.</i>

22:43.625 --> 22:45.750
I found everybody!

22:46.666 --> 22:48.041
And I found…

22:48.125 --> 22:49.958
you, big kids!

22:50.458 --> 22:55.416
I told you I was the best at finding.
And thanks for helping me count to ten.

22:55.500 --> 22:57.125
Bye-bye. Love you!

22:57.208 --> 23:00.291
-Bye!
-Bye-bye! See you soon!
