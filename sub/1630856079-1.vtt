00:18.059 --> 00:27.317
(♪♪♪)

00:39.306 --> 00:42.373
(indistinct chatter)

00:42.375 --> 00:51.341
(♪♪♪)

00:54.479 --> 01:03.437
(♪♪♪)

01:05.107 --> 01:07.274
Natalie, honey,
I thought we agreed

01:07.309 --> 01:09.751
You wouldn't come
into your mom's office anymore.

01:09.828 --> 01:11.361
But I miss her.

01:11.363 --> 01:12.796
And I wanted
to draw her favorite flower

01:12.906 --> 01:14.214
Like she used to.

01:14.216 --> 01:15.473
I know, honey, I miss her, too.

01:15.475 --> 01:17.433
But look, we're late
for the exhibit.

01:17.511 --> 01:19.244
Come on. Let's go.

01:22.416 --> 01:25.508
(indistinct chatter)

01:25.585 --> 01:34.501
(♪♪♪)

01:35.020 --> 01:36.470
-Mr. Freeman!
-Hey, how are you?

01:36.505 --> 01:37.354
-Hey!
-Thanks for coming.

01:37.522 --> 01:39.189
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

01:39.191 --> 01:40.849
This is amazing.

01:42.194 --> 01:44.286
Hi, how'd you hurt your foot?

01:44.363 --> 01:46.196
I hurt it at the playground.

01:46.198 --> 01:47.605
Are you here by yourself?

01:47.607 --> 01:50.200
No, I'm here with my dad.

01:50.277 --> 01:51.527
He's right there.

01:52.354 --> 01:54.187
He's mad because he can't
find his painting.

01:54.189 --> 01:56.173
Maybe we can help him find it.

01:56.175 --> 01:58.175
Young derek:
I can't.
He told me to wait here.

01:58.210 --> 01:58.992
How's that gonna help?

01:59.161 --> 02:01.078
Uh, yeah, why don't we step
into my office?

02:01.113 --> 02:02.079
It's uh, private.

02:02.114 --> 02:03.205
Yeah, yeah.

02:07.703 --> 02:10.370
Mr. Mason,
can I offer you a drink?

02:10.405 --> 02:11.587
No.

02:11.589 --> 02:13.781
My painting was supposed to be
in this exhibit.

02:13.859 --> 02:14.891
I gave it to your wife.

02:14.968 --> 02:15.859
When was that?

02:15.894 --> 02:17.118
Last month.

02:17.120 --> 02:20.681
It was about a week before
she-- before her accident.

02:20.716 --> 02:22.382
And I'm really sorry.

02:22.459 --> 02:24.534
But when I heard you were
going ahead with the exhibit,

02:24.536 --> 02:27.128
I assumed the painting would be
on display.

02:27.739 --> 02:30.148
I was still hoping it would be
my big break.

02:30.150 --> 02:31.191
I understand.
Do you have the paperwork?

02:31.226 --> 02:33.152
No, she scribbled it
on a napkin

02:33.154 --> 02:34.719
And said
that's how she always does it.

02:34.721 --> 02:35.963
Yeah, she did.

02:35.998 --> 02:38.489
Um, her passion was art,
not business.

02:38.491 --> 02:39.474
Do you have the napkin?

02:39.551 --> 02:40.659
I don't have it.

02:41.853 --> 02:44.538
Mr. Mason, I don't have
any record of your painting,

02:44.573 --> 02:46.265
And you don't have
the paperwork,

02:46.267 --> 02:47.583
And I have to get back
to my opening.

02:47.659 --> 02:49.075
So that's it?

02:49.152 --> 02:50.835
You're not gonna do anything
about this?

02:50.837 --> 02:53.397
It was a painting
of this picture.

02:53.432 --> 02:54.080
Look at it!

02:54.249 --> 02:55.598
Robert:
There's nothing more I can do.

02:55.600 --> 02:57.918
What kind of business
are you running here?

02:57.953 --> 03:00.261
I'm gonna tell everyone
that the freeman

03:00.263 --> 03:01.755
And you stole my work!

03:01.831 --> 03:04.725
Robert:
Hey. Come on.

03:04.760 --> 03:06.268
Let's go.

03:07.979 --> 03:09.354
You'll regret this!

03:11.399 --> 03:12.657
Come on, son.

03:12.659 --> 03:14.568
I will ruin this museum!

03:19.550 --> 03:20.991
Dad!

03:25.538 --> 03:34.546
(♪♪♪)

03:36.008 --> 03:38.308
Alex said your interview
went well yesterday.

03:38.343 --> 03:39.125
It did, actually.

03:39.294 --> 03:40.961
I have a second interview
with the higher-ups.

03:41.037 --> 03:42.429
We're gonna have to
start planning these sessions

03:42.431 --> 03:44.781
When maya's not around
to distract you.

03:44.783 --> 03:45.807
Sorry.

03:48.620 --> 03:50.062
Why don't you just paint me
from my photo

03:50.138 --> 03:50.729
Like you always do?

03:50.839 --> 03:51.687
Those aren't portraits.

03:51.732 --> 03:53.656
Plus, I want this one
to be perfect.

03:53.733 --> 03:56.359
What session does this make?
Five?

03:56.361 --> 03:57.385
Six, I think.

03:57.463 --> 04:00.330
No. Seven.

04:00.332 --> 04:01.572
I believe natalie.

04:01.574 --> 04:03.141
It's hard to sit still
for that long.

04:03.218 --> 04:05.869
Yeah, especially when someone
keeps talking to you.

04:06.872 --> 04:08.171
Maya, can you come over here,

04:08.248 --> 04:09.772
Give me your opinion
on something?

04:09.850 --> 04:10.999
Really?

04:11.001 --> 04:13.901
You want me to see
the famous natalie masterpiece?

04:13.903 --> 04:15.211
I'll give you my opinion!

04:15.213 --> 04:17.714
Whoa, not so fast.
I didn't ask you.

04:24.172 --> 04:25.889
It's going to be perfect.

04:27.500 --> 04:28.691
What's wrong?

04:28.693 --> 04:30.101
Maya:
Nothing.

04:30.103 --> 04:32.754
I was just trying to see
if I could find your initials.

04:32.831 --> 04:33.847
Does this guy really think

04:33.849 --> 04:35.440
Someone's gonna
steal his artwork?

04:35.442 --> 04:36.924
Is that really
why you hide your initials

04:37.002 --> 04:38.151
In all your paintings?

04:38.153 --> 04:40.353
Steal or copy.
It happens all the time.

04:40.430 --> 04:43.431
Museums take advantage
of artists every day.

04:43.433 --> 04:44.282
Wow!

04:44.326 --> 04:46.392
And I just thought
it was a cute, quirky habit.

04:46.470 --> 04:47.911
Nope.

04:53.335 --> 04:54.334
Natalie:
Hello?

04:54.886 --> 04:56.586
Yeah, this is natalie free--

04:59.741 --> 05:01.717
What?

05:03.378 --> 05:04.803
Is he okay?

05:06.348 --> 05:08.715
Uh, I'll be right there.

05:08.792 --> 05:09.957
What's wrong?

05:10.035 --> 05:12.794
Um, it's my dad.

05:12.871 --> 05:14.462
Your dad?

05:14.464 --> 05:16.255
He's at the hospital.

05:16.257 --> 05:17.799
They think
he had a heart attack.

05:17.876 --> 05:19.675
Yeah, I-- I really gotta go,
guys.

05:19.753 --> 05:20.293
I'll drive you.

05:20.312 --> 05:21.777
No, no, no. It's okay.

05:21.779 --> 05:22.896
You know hospitals.

05:22.931 --> 05:24.263
I'll probably be there
all night.

05:24.341 --> 05:25.990
Alex:
I don't mind.

05:25.992 --> 05:27.400
Natalie:
I'll be all right.

05:27.644 --> 05:28.702
(kisses)

05:33.325 --> 05:34.174
She never mentions

05:34.309 --> 05:35.600
That she has any family
around here.

05:35.677 --> 05:36.335
Yeah, just her dad,

05:36.703 --> 05:38.562
But I don't think
they've talked in years.

05:38.564 --> 05:40.547
Her mom died when she was young.

05:40.582 --> 05:42.049
Apparently
he threw himself into work,

05:42.084 --> 05:43.800
Left natalie to fend
for herself.

05:43.802 --> 05:46.436
Do you think that's why
she didn't want you

05:46.513 --> 05:47.837
To go with her?

05:47.914 --> 05:48.755
I don't know.

05:48.832 --> 05:51.558
She clearly
didn't want me there.

05:53.269 --> 05:56.270
Hospital announcer (on speaker):
<i>Doctor morris, dial 118, please.</i>

05:56.272 --> 05:59.933
<i>Doctor morris, please dial 118.</i>

05:59.935 --> 06:01.751
Luke:
Natalie.

06:01.753 --> 06:03.320
Hey. Thanks for comin'.

06:03.355 --> 06:04.795
Of course.

06:04.797 --> 06:07.207
The nurse told me
you were out here.

06:07.468 --> 06:09.593
So, how's your dad?

06:09.628 --> 06:13.704
He's gonna be okay.
Thankfully he was wearin' this.

06:13.706 --> 06:15.615
He's been wearing one of those
since we were in high school.

06:15.617 --> 06:16.616
Good thing, too.

06:16.618 --> 06:18.042
Dr. Byer said
the medicine in here

06:18.044 --> 06:19.786
Is what saved his life.

06:19.788 --> 06:21.938
Where's alex?

06:21.940 --> 06:22.697
He offered to drive me,

06:22.791 --> 06:24.882
But he knows me
as natalie calvert,

06:24.884 --> 06:26.510
Not natalie freeman.

06:27.512 --> 06:28.628
Why haven't you told him
already?

06:28.705 --> 06:30.371
I'm not a freeman anymore.

06:30.373 --> 06:33.891
I thought I left my dad
and that life behind for good.

06:33.893 --> 06:36.186
I just feel like I'm hiding
this big secret from him.

06:37.439 --> 06:40.190
I mean, you kinda are.

06:45.905 --> 06:49.073
Jeff:
Is natalie staying
at the hospital with her dad?

06:49.075 --> 06:49.732
Alex:
Yeah.

06:49.901 --> 06:50.826
And after he gets discharged
tomorrow,

06:51.269 --> 06:53.286
She's gonna stay with him
at his house for a couple days.

06:53.321 --> 06:55.664
Hmm. Have you seen her?

06:57.100 --> 06:57.690
(grunts)

06:57.768 --> 06:58.841
Nope.

06:58.843 --> 07:02.695
We talked, texted a little,
but she won't let me help.

07:02.773 --> 07:05.740
Some things are goin' on.
I can feel it.

07:05.817 --> 07:14.766
(♪♪♪)

07:18.947 --> 07:19.837
Natalie!

07:19.948 --> 07:21.197
Oh, flora,
it's so good to see you.

07:21.274 --> 07:22.699
Hi, sweetie.

07:22.701 --> 07:24.985
Hi, natalie.
I'm derek, the museum curator.

07:25.020 --> 07:26.035
Nice to meet you.

07:26.112 --> 07:27.504
It's cold outside, guys.
Come in.

07:27.539 --> 07:28.738
Thank you.

07:30.792 --> 07:32.259
It's so great
to finally meet you.

07:32.294 --> 07:34.453
Your dad talks about you
all the time.

07:35.447 --> 07:37.104
Do you remember
I used to make these for you

07:37.182 --> 07:37.998
All the time.

07:38.033 --> 07:38.940
Mm, how could I forget

07:39.125 --> 07:41.184
Flora's famous
chocolate chip cookies?

07:41.219 --> 07:42.460
(chuckle together)

07:42.462 --> 07:43.520
Finally someone
to take 'em off my hands.

07:43.555 --> 07:45.221
I'm uh, gettin' a little rotund.

07:45.223 --> 07:46.506
(chuckle together)

07:46.508 --> 07:49.392
Anyway uh, your dad wanted me
to bring you these files.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.595
Mm. I just got him settled.
He really should be restin'.

07:51.630 --> 07:52.729
I got bored.

07:52.805 --> 07:53.229
(gasps)

07:53.365 --> 07:54.514
But you just got home.

07:54.516 --> 07:56.099
I got work to do.

07:56.134 --> 07:57.217
Natalie:
Dad?

07:57.293 --> 07:58.735
We have an exhibit
opening next Friday,

07:58.811 --> 08:00.044
And the freeman
has never canceled

08:00.122 --> 08:01.396
An opening reception.

08:01.473 --> 08:04.023
And do you remember
what the doctors told you?

08:04.025 --> 08:06.042
Come on.
Let's talk shop in my study.

08:06.077 --> 08:07.151
You got it, boss.

08:07.153 --> 08:08.052
I'll take those.

08:08.297 --> 08:11.180
Looks like I'm gonna need
to make a fresh pot of coffee.

08:11.258 --> 08:20.207
(♪♪♪)

08:30.994 --> 08:32.085
It's beautiful, isn't it?

08:32.161 --> 08:34.571
Yeah. It really is.

08:34.606 --> 08:36.939
You know, I've been thinking
of finding something

08:37.016 --> 08:39.016
That represents
a father-son bond

08:39.018 --> 08:41.611
For the family exhibit
next month.

08:41.688 --> 08:42.428
Would you consider?

08:42.505 --> 08:43.271
Robert:
No.

08:44.449 --> 08:45.448
We don't know its provenance.

08:45.567 --> 08:49.026
It would be irresponsible
to display it at the museum.

08:49.028 --> 08:50.436
All right. Easy, dad.

08:50.471 --> 08:51.938
The doctors warned you
not to get upset,

08:51.973 --> 08:54.491
And this is why you're
not supposed to be workin'.

08:54.526 --> 08:56.042
Derek:
Sorry.

08:56.119 --> 08:57.460
Why don't you just
leave the papers here,

08:57.537 --> 08:58.745
And he can get to them
after he's gotten

08:58.780 --> 08:59.579
A little bit of rest.

08:59.614 --> 09:02.432
I'm fine. I can work.

09:02.467 --> 09:04.543
I'll let you two figure it out.

09:07.222 --> 09:08.796
Why don't I walk you out?

09:08.874 --> 09:12.300
Take it easy, mr. Freeman.
For all of us, okay?

09:16.481 --> 09:17.614
Natalie:
Sorry about my dad.

09:17.649 --> 09:19.783
Don't apologize.
He needs his rest.

09:19.818 --> 09:21.434
Natalie:
I know he's the one
that called you.

09:21.469 --> 09:24.271
Work comes first for him.
It always has.

09:24.273 --> 09:26.564
I'll see if I can get him
to look into that painting.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.983
I'd appreciate that.
See you later.

09:28.985 --> 09:30.360
Take care.

09:42.357 --> 09:44.908
These just got delivered
for you.

09:44.943 --> 09:46.993
I see you're still not
listenin' to your doctors.

09:46.995 --> 09:48.128
(sighs)

09:48.163 --> 09:48.828
Ooh.

09:48.997 --> 09:51.631
I hope those are
what I think they are.

09:53.752 --> 09:55.534
(sighs)

09:55.612 --> 09:58.763
The future master art exhibit
is still six months away.

09:58.840 --> 10:00.857
You have plenty of time
to prepare.

10:00.933 --> 10:02.099
I started early

10:02.101 --> 10:04.360
Because this year
has to be perfect.

10:04.437 --> 10:05.862
20th anniversary.

10:05.864 --> 10:08.431
It was mom's passion helpin'
out new artists.

10:08.433 --> 10:10.400
Yeah, it was always
her favorite cause.

10:11.403 --> 10:12.902
Do you think that I could have
one of those

10:12.979 --> 10:14.320
For a talented artist I know?

10:14.322 --> 10:15.455
Yeah, sure.

10:15.531 --> 10:16.614
Um, come here for a second.
Have a seat.

10:16.616 --> 10:20.042
I wanna talk to you
about something.

10:20.620 --> 10:23.621
I just wanna thank you
for taking such good care of me

10:23.623 --> 10:24.831
This past week.

10:25.708 --> 10:27.125
That's what family does.

10:28.611 --> 10:30.003
Well, I didn't.

10:30.797 --> 10:35.725
I regret not taking better care
of you when your mom died.

10:35.802 --> 10:37.761
I should have been
a better father.

10:38.621 --> 10:40.638
That was really tough.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.715
I lost both of you
the day mom died.

10:42.792 --> 10:43.716
(sighs)

10:43.793 --> 10:45.535
And you couldn't get away
fast enough.

10:45.537 --> 10:48.855
You went off to college
and never looked back.

10:48.890 --> 10:52.408
You never gave me an indication
you wanted me home.

10:52.485 --> 10:53.150
I don't know.

10:53.295 --> 10:55.628
Just you and your mom
had such a--

10:55.663 --> 10:56.904
Such a special relationship.

10:56.982 --> 10:58.739
I-- I guess I just thought
I could never compare,

10:58.741 --> 11:01.834
So I just threw myself
into my work

11:01.911 --> 11:03.169
And I never tried.

11:03.246 --> 11:05.747
I regret that
more than anything.

11:07.826 --> 11:09.225
I needed you.

11:09.260 --> 11:11.211
I know.

11:11.246 --> 11:14.089
I know. I'm so sorry.

11:15.174 --> 11:17.967
But I'm glad
we're back together now.

11:19.671 --> 11:23.831
I was so scared that night,
I thought I lost you forever.

11:23.909 --> 11:25.683
But then it made me realize

11:25.685 --> 11:28.103
That I'm so glad
we have a second chance.

11:28.763 --> 11:31.272
I'm so glad you're okay, dad.

11:39.841 --> 11:40.356
Natalie:
Hey.

11:40.525 --> 11:42.926
Maya:
Hey. How's your dad?

11:42.961 --> 11:44.694
He's doin' a little bit better
each day.

11:44.696 --> 11:46.413
Good. I'm glad to hear it.

11:47.398 --> 11:48.990
Where's alex?

11:48.992 --> 11:49.749
Just left.

11:49.751 --> 11:51.935
Went to meet somebody
about a new commission.

11:51.970 --> 11:53.119
I'll leave him a note.

11:53.121 --> 11:54.729
Okay.

11:54.806 --> 12:03.763
(♪♪♪)

12:09.712 --> 12:18.737
(♪♪♪)

12:26.062 --> 12:27.987
(laughs)

12:28.064 --> 12:28.955
Thanks.

12:32.994 --> 12:34.176
(groans)

12:34.253 --> 12:43.178
(♪♪♪)

12:53.606 --> 12:55.181
I am so sorry.

12:55.216 --> 12:57.166
Totally fine. You okay?

12:57.201 --> 12:59.185
Yeah. I saw someone I knew.

12:59.187 --> 13:00.987
And that is
not how my dad wanted me

13:01.022 --> 13:02.355
To give you this.

13:02.431 --> 13:03.764
No worries.

13:03.842 --> 13:05.358
How's your dad doin' today?

13:05.360 --> 13:06.826
He's restin' up for the openin'.

13:06.861 --> 13:09.603
It's not what the doctors want,
but he's stubborn.

13:10.048 --> 13:11.246
Will you be joining us?

13:11.324 --> 13:12.798
I wouldn't miss it.

13:12.875 --> 13:13.958
I should actually probably
go get ready.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.276
It's been a long time
since I've been

13:15.353 --> 13:17.020
To a freeman openin'.

13:17.055 --> 13:18.371
It's good to have you back.

13:18.373 --> 13:19.446
Thanks.

13:19.524 --> 13:28.515
(♪♪♪)

13:33.905 --> 13:36.898
(indistinct chatter)

13:42.030 --> 13:42.904
Natalie:
Yeah!

13:45.867 --> 13:47.216
Don't leave the house
without this.

13:47.218 --> 13:48.117
I know.

13:49.037 --> 13:50.245
Thank you so much for coming.

13:51.255 --> 13:52.205
Nice to meet you.

13:54.734 --> 13:56.909
Thank you
for making tonight possible.

13:56.944 --> 13:58.628
Um, well, you were determined
to make it happen,

13:58.663 --> 14:00.070
And derek here did all the work.

14:00.148 --> 14:01.247
Oh, stop.

14:01.324 --> 14:02.489
Are you sure
I can't convince you

14:02.567 --> 14:03.399
To work with your old man?

14:03.568 --> 14:05.159
I think we make
a pretty good team.

14:05.161 --> 14:06.553
Mm, don't think about it.

14:06.588 --> 14:08.604
Don't you think it would be
great if she worked with us?

14:08.681 --> 14:09.847
Yeah, come on!

14:09.849 --> 14:11.741
Father and daughter
back together.

14:11.776 --> 14:13.334
I mean, family
is the most important thing.

14:13.411 --> 14:14.351
Yeah, see?

14:14.353 --> 14:15.778
Even derek thinks
it's a great idea.

14:15.855 --> 14:17.730
You yourself said
you want a job.

14:17.840 --> 14:19.941
I don't even see
why there's a question.

14:21.419 --> 14:22.085
Oh!

14:22.120 --> 14:24.286
Robert.

14:24.363 --> 14:26.122
Have you met derek, our curator?

14:26.198 --> 14:27.364
Nice to meet you.

14:27.442 --> 14:28.007
Hi!

14:28.009 --> 14:28.758
Nice to meet you.

14:28.927 --> 14:30.184
Nice to meet you.
I'm danielle abbott.

14:30.261 --> 14:32.245
And uh, you remember
my daughter natalie?

14:33.189 --> 14:33.963
Natalie?

14:34.040 --> 14:35.131
(robert laughing)

14:35.133 --> 14:36.023
Danielle:
Wow!

14:36.101 --> 14:37.800
She's quite an artist
in her own right.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.193
In fact, I have
one of her sunflower drawings

14:39.270 --> 14:40.253
At my office.

14:40.288 --> 14:42.546
Perhaps I should
have you appraise it.

14:42.548 --> 14:43.806
Natalie:
Come on, dad.

14:43.883 --> 14:46.142
She knows exactly how much
a kid's artwork is worth.

14:46.144 --> 14:48.369
You know, I've seen pictures
of your mom,

14:48.446 --> 14:50.054
And I've heard about
the passion that she had

14:50.056 --> 14:51.797
For undiscovered talent.

14:51.874 --> 14:53.816
You look exactly like her,

14:53.893 --> 14:55.735
And you have the same passion
in your eyes.

14:55.737 --> 14:56.736
Thank you.

14:56.771 --> 14:57.954
That's a really
great compliment.

14:57.989 --> 14:59.272
Danielle:
Aw!

14:59.274 --> 15:01.958
Um, do you mind
if I borrow your dad

15:02.068 --> 15:02.959
For a minute?

15:02.961 --> 15:04.068
We need to speak privately.

15:04.070 --> 15:04.944
Yeah, of course.

15:04.979 --> 15:06.403
Yeah, you know,
let's just call it a night.

15:06.405 --> 15:07.980
I mean,
you've gotta be exhausted.

15:08.057 --> 15:09.449
Yeah, I'll start
to pick up around here.

15:09.484 --> 15:10.283
Don't worry.

15:10.318 --> 15:11.284
We have a cleaning crew
for that.

15:11.453 --> 15:13.394
Well, in that case,
I'm gonna go upstairs,

15:13.471 --> 15:15.121
Take off these shoes,
and go to bed.

15:15.156 --> 15:16.155
You guys have a good night.

15:16.232 --> 15:17.581
-Have fun.
-Nice seein' you.

15:17.583 --> 15:18.166
Let's go there.

15:19.894 --> 15:21.961
Derek,
can you just give us a minute?

15:21.996 --> 15:22.569
Okay.

15:22.997 --> 15:25.331
I'm so sorry
to rush everybody off like that.

15:25.333 --> 15:27.383
No, it's okay.
What's on your mind?

15:28.744 --> 15:31.187
Um, I really don't know how
to say this,

15:31.263 --> 15:34.924
And maybe you already know,
but this painting,

15:34.959 --> 15:37.226
It isn't an original.

15:37.695 --> 15:38.995
What?

15:38.997 --> 15:40.763
Well, what do you mean
the cantor's not an original?

15:40.840 --> 15:43.849
An art collector friend of mine
just purchased the original.

15:43.926 --> 15:46.235
I appraised it,
like a couple weeks ago.

15:47.872 --> 15:49.430
Oh,
this can't be happening again.

15:49.841 --> 15:51.265
This has happened before?

15:51.267 --> 15:53.159
It was an isolated incident.

15:54.362 --> 15:55.452
I'm really sorry, robert,

15:55.604 --> 15:58.531
But my friend has all
of the original documentation.

15:58.607 --> 16:00.124
I had assumed that you sold it.

16:00.126 --> 16:01.291
This was
my wife's favorite painting.

16:01.293 --> 16:02.669
I would never sell it.

16:02.671 --> 16:05.755
Certainly wouldn't hang a copy
on the walls of my museum.

16:07.058 --> 16:09.391
That's why I brought it
to your attention.

16:09.468 --> 16:12.461
If you'd like, I can try
to find more information

16:12.538 --> 16:14.180
About the seller.

16:14.182 --> 16:15.765
I appreciate that.

16:16.901 --> 16:18.567
Who else knows about this?

16:18.569 --> 16:21.070
Just my friend. And myself.

16:21.105 --> 16:23.297
My friend
has just as much concern

16:23.299 --> 16:24.691
About this painting
being stolen.

16:24.693 --> 16:26.242
I'm sure.

16:26.318 --> 16:28.227
I'd like to see a copy
of the appraisal.

16:28.229 --> 16:29.486
Danielle:
Absolutely.

16:29.564 --> 16:30.737
I don't really see why there
should be a problem

16:30.739 --> 16:33.307
With getting you a copy.

16:33.309 --> 16:34.409
I'm sorry.

16:35.670 --> 16:38.162
(sighs)

16:39.073 --> 16:39.755
You okay, boss?

16:39.815 --> 16:41.648
Huh? Yeah, yeah, I'm okay.

16:41.726 --> 16:43.425
Has everyone else left?

16:43.502 --> 16:44.651
Yeah, pretty much.

16:44.729 --> 16:45.645
Robert:
Okay.

16:45.964 --> 16:47.754
Make sure you lock the door
on the way out.

16:47.756 --> 16:48.798
Okay, yeah. I can help you--

16:48.833 --> 16:50.349
I'll talk to you tomorrow,
derek.

16:50.351 --> 16:52.093
Okay.

16:52.770 --> 16:54.086
(sighs)

16:54.163 --> 17:03.229
(♪♪♪)

17:04.124 --> 17:07.150
(takes deep breaths)

17:08.736 --> 17:11.696
(scoffs)

17:12.382 --> 17:14.449
There's no signature.

17:15.877 --> 17:17.452
What's this?

17:20.715 --> 17:21.831
No.

17:22.533 --> 17:24.717
(pants)

17:24.719 --> 17:27.045
No. Not again.

17:28.130 --> 17:31.049
(groans)

17:32.894 --> 17:35.636
No, no, no.

17:37.706 --> 17:40.683
(groans)

17:46.140 --> 17:48.140
No! No! No, no!

17:48.142 --> 17:51.135
(groans, pants)

17:51.212 --> 18:00.203
(♪♪♪)

18:11.316 --> 18:13.590
(gasps)

18:13.592 --> 18:14.926
Are you okay?

18:16.838 --> 18:21.357
Um, I think I know who put
the future master's flyer

18:21.433 --> 18:22.933
In your backpack.

18:22.935 --> 18:25.019
Who?

18:25.921 --> 18:26.528
(laughs)

18:26.530 --> 18:27.855
Are you gonna tell me?

18:29.258 --> 18:32.235
I think it was natalie.

18:35.030 --> 18:38.007
That's crazy.
Why would you say that?

18:38.042 --> 18:45.331
Because your natalie
is actually natalie freeman.

18:45.366 --> 18:46.999
What?

18:53.132 --> 18:54.623
Sources report that
although robert

18:54.658 --> 18:57.226
And his daughter natalie
were estranged,

18:57.228 --> 18:59.561
They reconnected as he recovered
from a heart attack

18:59.638 --> 19:00.888
Only weeks ago.

19:03.901 --> 19:07.186
Unfortunately, after having
a fatal heart attack last night,

19:07.221 --> 19:08.971
The art community
will suffer greatly

19:09.048 --> 19:11.440
With the loss of robert freeman.

19:15.864 --> 19:17.572
I've read enough.

19:24.271 --> 19:25.587
Shit.

19:25.664 --> 19:34.630
(♪♪♪)

19:44.442 --> 19:47.310
(sobs)

19:48.496 --> 19:49.562
It's okay.

19:49.564 --> 19:52.506
(sobs)

19:52.583 --> 20:01.574
(♪♪♪)

20:04.120 --> 20:06.913
Natalie:
Thanks for bringing over
the donuts and coffee.

20:06.948 --> 20:08.021
No problem.

20:08.466 --> 20:11.024
Did you get any sleep?

20:11.026 --> 20:12.542
I just can't stop thinkin'.

20:12.544 --> 20:13.527
I don't understand
why my dad didn't

20:13.771 --> 20:17.222
Take his emergency medicine
like he did last time.

20:17.257 --> 20:19.458
Maybe he just didn't have time.

20:19.493 --> 20:20.117
But that's the thing.

20:20.394 --> 20:21.226
The doctor said
he wasn't even wearing

20:21.303 --> 20:22.144
The pendant.

20:22.146 --> 20:24.646
And he always wears his
pendant.

20:24.723 --> 20:27.308
Or... Or...

20:29.136 --> 20:29.876
I can't even imagine

20:30.154 --> 20:32.271
What you're going through
right now.

20:32.306 --> 20:33.397
Thank you for comin' over here

20:33.441 --> 20:35.124
And helping me sort through
some of the stuff

20:35.159 --> 20:37.150
Before I meet up
with my dad's lawyer.

20:37.152 --> 20:38.051
Of course.

20:38.129 --> 20:41.380
This stuff can be confusing.
Trust me, I get it.

20:41.382 --> 20:44.308
I don't even know the name
of half of these documents.

20:44.310 --> 20:45.250
Did you know
there's something called

20:45.311 --> 20:47.803
“a letter of last instruction”?

20:47.838 --> 20:48.996
Your dad probably didn't know

20:49.073 --> 20:51.231
When you guys
were gonna reconnect.

20:51.309 --> 20:53.125
By signing a letter
of last instruction,

20:53.160 --> 20:54.326
It's a way
where he can make sure

20:54.403 --> 20:55.978
All of his affairs
are taken care of

20:56.013 --> 20:57.463
Exactly how he wanted.

20:59.683 --> 21:01.925
I guess that makes sense.

21:01.927 --> 21:02.985
Where are the documents?

21:02.987 --> 21:05.321
They're in my dad's study.
I can go get 'em.

21:05.356 --> 21:07.723
I'll come with you.
We can work in there.

21:15.533 --> 21:16.649
Jeff:
Yo!

21:19.036 --> 21:21.303
Wasn't expecting
to see you here.

21:21.381 --> 21:23.155
Is everything okay?

21:29.514 --> 21:31.347
Looks just like the original.

21:31.382 --> 21:33.699
Yeah, that's what
they're paying me for.

21:33.701 --> 21:36.294
As soon as I get my money
for this, I'm outta here.

21:37.371 --> 21:39.045
Jeff:
When do you deliver it?

21:39.123 --> 21:40.731
Tomorrow night.

21:40.958 --> 21:43.634
Have you talked to natalie?

21:44.487 --> 21:45.544
No.

21:45.621 --> 21:46.470
She tried calling,

21:46.638 --> 21:47.513
But I still
can't get over the fact,

21:47.548 --> 21:49.140
That she's a freeman.

21:50.184 --> 21:52.234
I never would have started
a relationship with her

21:52.311 --> 21:53.285
If I had known.

21:53.320 --> 21:54.854
Is it really that bad?

21:54.889 --> 21:58.190
Dude, she lied to me
about everything.

21:58.225 --> 21:59.800
She knows how I feel.

21:59.877 --> 22:03.195
After everything I told her
about my dad.

22:03.230 --> 22:05.031
All he ever wanted
was validation

22:05.066 --> 22:06.565
From people like the freemans.

22:06.642 --> 22:08.250
But he never got it.

22:08.327 --> 22:11.070
So he turned to booze
and threw it all away.

22:11.146 --> 22:13.313
Now I find out she's a freeman.

22:13.391 --> 22:15.791
I thought you said
she might be the one.

22:17.795 --> 22:18.927
Yeah.

22:18.962 --> 22:20.695
Natalie calvert
might have been the one,

22:20.773 --> 22:23.257
But I don't even know
who natalie freeman is.

22:28.089 --> 22:31.223
Dude, you should give
her a chance to explain.

22:38.340 --> 22:40.115
Recorded voiceover (on phone):
<i> ...Is not available.</i>

22:40.192 --> 22:41.484
<i> ...At the tone.</i>

22:42.362 --> 22:44.779
Straight to voicemail again.

22:46.257 --> 22:48.407
I don't even know
what to do anymore.

22:59.361 --> 23:01.862
W-- what are you doing?

23:01.939 --> 23:03.363
I promised derek
I'd look into the provenance

23:03.474 --> 23:04.106
Of this painting.

23:04.383 --> 23:05.715
So I was gonna
take it downstairs

23:05.717 --> 23:07.626
To my dad's office.

23:07.703 --> 23:09.202
Can it wait?

23:09.204 --> 23:10.370
No.

23:10.448 --> 23:13.707
Now that my dad's gone,
I really need to count on derek

23:13.709 --> 23:16.059
To keep this museum runnin'.

23:16.061 --> 23:18.044
And I get the feeling
that he doesn't quite know

23:18.122 --> 23:19.105
What to think of me.

23:19.214 --> 23:21.323
I was hoping that maybe
if I cleared the paintin',

23:21.400 --> 23:24.652
And he could exhibit it,
that maybe it would help.

23:26.839 --> 23:27.822
All right.

23:33.337 --> 23:35.204
You know, there's someone
at my office

23:35.239 --> 23:38.173
Who researches people
for my clients all the time.

23:38.250 --> 23:40.066
I can have them look into it.

23:40.144 --> 23:41.735
Really? That'd be great.

23:41.812 --> 23:42.795
Luke:
Yeah, no problem.

23:43.648 --> 23:46.799
You have got a lot going on.

23:46.834 --> 23:49.276
Hopefully I can have an answer
for you in a couple days.

23:49.353 --> 23:51.320
Thanks, I appreciate that.

23:51.355 --> 23:52.746
Can I also make a suggestion?

23:52.823 --> 23:54.356
Of course.

23:54.433 --> 23:57.309
Go find alex.
Go talk to him in person.

23:57.344 --> 24:00.496
Find out
where the two of you stand.

24:00.531 --> 24:01.922
Yeah.

24:01.999 --> 24:03.256
Thanks for always lookin' out
for me.

24:03.334 --> 24:03.773
Of course.

24:03.775 --> 24:05.151
(kisses)

24:22.044 --> 24:24.628
Hey, maya.
Sorry for stopping by so late.

24:24.705 --> 24:27.139
No, I'm glad you're here.

24:27.215 --> 24:30.617
Natalie,
I'm so sorry about your dad.

24:30.619 --> 24:31.727
You know?

24:31.803 --> 24:33.386
Mmhmm, yeah.

24:33.388 --> 24:33.787
(sighs)

24:33.848 --> 24:35.764
Does alex know, too?

24:37.459 --> 24:39.392
That's why he's not answering
any of my phone calls

24:39.470 --> 24:40.394
Or my text messages.

24:43.073 --> 24:44.214
Can I get you somethin'
to drink?

24:44.292 --> 24:46.642
No, I'm okay.

24:46.677 --> 24:48.736
How do you know about my dad?

24:50.231 --> 24:52.931
I saw an article
in my news feed.

24:53.009 --> 24:54.950
There was a picture
of you two together.

25:00.482 --> 25:02.374
How did alex take it?

25:03.819 --> 25:06.261
Not well.

25:06.338 --> 25:07.755
He was really upset.

25:08.757 --> 25:11.266
He's mad because you lied
to him, natalie.

25:11.301 --> 25:14.670
It's hard finding out somebody
is not who you think they are.

25:14.705 --> 25:16.221
But that's the thing.

25:16.223 --> 25:18.390
I'm exactly who he thinks I am.
I'm natalie calvert.

25:18.392 --> 25:20.909
I haven't been natalie freeman
since before I went off

25:20.944 --> 25:21.593
To college.

25:21.729 --> 25:24.270
And I didn't lie
to him about anything.

25:24.272 --> 25:26.732
I just didn't tell him
everything.

25:27.518 --> 25:30.860
I suppose
you're upset with me, too, now?

25:30.862 --> 25:33.288
Hmm. A little at first.

25:33.365 --> 25:36.458
But then I realized you must
have had your reasons

25:36.535 --> 25:39.019
To give all that up.

25:39.096 --> 25:41.688
You're an artist.
And a freeman.

25:41.766 --> 25:43.373
You had it made.

25:43.375 --> 25:46.785
I'm not an artist like you are,
but I do love art.

25:46.862 --> 25:48.837
I think I got that from my mom.

25:51.049 --> 25:53.509
Do you have any idea when alex
is gonna be back?

25:54.311 --> 25:58.347
Oh, natalie, he's gone for good.

25:58.349 --> 25:59.381
What?

25:59.383 --> 26:01.600
Maya:
He completely
cleared out his space.

26:10.577 --> 26:11.418
(sighs)

26:11.495 --> 26:13.511
I never wanted him
to find out this way.

26:13.513 --> 26:15.447
I should have told him sooner.

26:17.318 --> 26:19.409
I think he left that for you.

26:19.411 --> 26:21.579
Wait,
is this what I think it is?

26:24.292 --> 26:27.417
He wrapped it
a couple days ago.

26:27.419 --> 26:29.837
Why don't you wait
till you get home to open it?

26:31.014 --> 26:31.588
(sighs)

26:31.682 --> 26:34.908
Yeah. You're probably right.

26:34.985 --> 26:36.610
Thank you.

26:36.687 --> 26:37.535
Of course.

26:37.613 --> 26:38.762
And if you see alex,

26:38.764 --> 26:40.597
Can you please just tell him
that I'm really sorry?

26:40.599 --> 26:43.142
I'd like a chance
to at least explain.

26:43.177 --> 26:45.311
I will. I promise.

26:45.346 --> 26:47.646
Okay. I better get outta here.

26:53.546 --> 26:54.503
I'll call you.

26:54.538 --> 26:55.738
Bye.

26:57.617 --> 27:06.832
(♪♪♪)

27:15.343 --> 27:18.393
(sobs)

27:18.470 --> 27:27.394
(♪♪♪)

27:33.485 --> 27:42.368
(♪♪♪)

27:48.425 --> 27:50.876

27:53.847 --> 27:59.885
(♪♪♪)

28:04.516 --> 28:13.440
(♪♪♪)

28:16.386 --> 28:19.271
I wanted to thank you all
for comin' out here today.

28:19.306 --> 28:23.025
My family has certainly gone
through some rough patches.

28:23.060 --> 28:25.577
But I am so grateful
that I was able

28:25.579 --> 28:29.456
To spend the last few weeks
with my father and reconnect.

28:30.133 --> 28:30.866
(natalie sniffles)

28:30.942 --> 28:32.534
Natalie:
Several of you are askin',

28:32.611 --> 28:34.794
“what's gonna happen
to the freeman?”

28:34.796 --> 28:36.588
And I'm pleased
to let you know

28:36.623 --> 28:38.640
That I plan to step in
for my father

28:38.717 --> 28:42.736
And will do everything it takes
to fulfill my family's legacy,

28:42.813 --> 28:46.473
And honor both my father
and my mother.

28:48.652 --> 28:51.294
My hope's that you guys
will be patient with me

28:51.296 --> 28:54.565
As I have some
rather large shoes to fill.

29:00.739 --> 29:01.947
(sniffles)

29:06.704 --> 29:08.871
-I'm so sorry for your loss.
-Thank you for coming.

29:10.582 --> 29:11.498
Thank you.

29:17.998 --> 29:19.881
Derek.

29:19.883 --> 29:22.042
I'm so sorry
I didn't tell you first.

29:22.119 --> 29:23.676
I really hope
I can still count on you

29:23.678 --> 29:24.936
To keep the museum runnin'.

29:25.013 --> 29:27.497
There's no way I can do this
without you.

29:27.575 --> 29:29.441
Yeah, of course.

29:29.443 --> 29:32.686
You can count on me
just like your father did.

29:36.725 --> 29:37.532
Danielle.

29:37.567 --> 29:38.542
Danielle:
Oh!

29:38.619 --> 29:39.434
Thank you for coming.

29:39.511 --> 29:40.619
Yeah.

29:40.621 --> 29:42.704
I am so sorry about your father.

29:42.706 --> 29:44.764
(sniffles, sighs)

29:44.842 --> 29:47.851
Um, there's something
I really need

29:47.928 --> 29:50.620
To discuss with you.

29:50.622 --> 29:52.105
Is everything okay?

29:52.182 --> 29:54.624
Yeah. It's important.

29:54.626 --> 29:55.951
I really need
to discuss with you.

29:56.027 --> 29:57.710
Is it okay
if I come by the museum

29:57.712 --> 29:58.896
Next week?

29:58.972 --> 30:00.121
Natalie:
Of course.

30:00.156 --> 30:00.798
-Okay.
-Okay.

30:00.800 --> 30:02.758
Okay. Thank you.

30:04.470 --> 30:06.394
That was really weird.

30:06.471 --> 30:07.537
What do you think that's about?

30:07.615 --> 30:09.397
I don't know.

30:09.399 --> 30:13.059
Anyway, derek, thank you so much
for comin' and doin' everything.

30:13.061 --> 30:14.569
Seriously, it's no problem.

30:14.646 --> 30:17.730
I do have to go deal with uh,
some crazy artists,

30:17.732 --> 30:21.059
Who wanna reschedule,
but uh, whatever you need.

30:21.061 --> 30:23.070
Seriously. Okay?

30:24.014 --> 30:26.698
If you need anything,
let me know, okay?

30:33.907 --> 30:37.000
(indistinct chatter)

30:45.386 --> 30:46.718
Thank you so much
for coming, guys.

30:46.720 --> 30:48.612
I couldn't do this
without my friends.

30:48.614 --> 30:49.613
Jeff:
Of course.

30:49.723 --> 30:51.431
Luke:
(indistinct speech)
was beautiful.

30:51.433 --> 30:53.642
(sniffles)

30:54.928 --> 30:56.878
Maya:
Your speech was beautiful.

30:56.956 --> 30:59.273
I have to get back
to the office, actually.

30:59.275 --> 31:01.616
Go, you've already missed
so much because of me.

31:01.693 --> 31:03.693
I've been exactly
where I needed to be.

31:03.695 --> 31:04.695
(kisses)

31:10.744 --> 31:12.995
Maya:
I'm free for dinner tonight,
if you'd like company.

31:14.114 --> 31:16.022
Natalie, you okay?

31:16.100 --> 31:17.616
Uh, sorry.

31:17.692 --> 31:19.801
Um, company would be
really nice.

31:19.803 --> 31:22.880
I'm gonna let you ladies go.
I'll see you soon.

31:24.191 --> 31:24.889
I have to go

31:25.025 --> 31:26.641
To my dad's attorney's office
first,

31:26.718 --> 31:27.884
But do you wanna
pick up somethin'

31:27.886 --> 31:29.535
And maybe back
a little bit later?

31:29.613 --> 31:30.721
Maya:
Sure thing.

31:33.634 --> 31:34.975
See you in a bit.

31:45.929 --> 31:54.995
(♪♪♪)

32:00.911 --> 32:09.968
(♪♪♪)

32:15.917 --> 32:24.983

32:38.048 --> 32:39.373
(groans)

32:44.805 --> 32:53.762
(♪♪♪)

33:01.988 --> 33:03.855
Natalie?

33:03.857 --> 33:12.656
(♪♪♪)

33:16.077 --> 33:17.911
Natalie?

33:26.246 --> 33:27.020
(groans)

33:27.022 --> 33:28.964
Natalie!

33:29.866 --> 33:32.433
Are you okay?

33:32.510 --> 33:33.159
Yeah, I think so.

33:33.237 --> 33:34.844
What happened?

33:34.846 --> 33:37.105
I don't know.
It all happened so fast.

33:37.107 --> 33:39.832
Someone was here
when I came home.

33:39.910 --> 33:41.685
I'm calling the police.

33:48.484 --> 33:50.318
(groans)

33:52.256 --> 33:54.156
Oh my god.

34:00.697 --> 34:01.863
Anything missing?

34:01.865 --> 34:04.766
They took a painting
from my dad's study.

34:04.801 --> 34:06.859
How valuable we talkin'?

34:06.937 --> 34:09.046
It's only valuable to me.

34:10.615 --> 34:12.758
They took the portrait
that alex did of me.

34:13.360 --> 34:14.867
No.

34:15.553 --> 34:17.128
I don't think anything else
is missing,

34:17.281 --> 34:19.038
But I can't be certain.

34:19.116 --> 34:21.624
Maya said you were unconscious
when she got here.

34:21.626 --> 34:23.285
I'm gonna call an ambulance
for you.

34:23.320 --> 34:24.544
You better get that checked out.

34:24.621 --> 34:26.546
Uh, no, that's okay.
I don't need an ambulance.

34:26.623 --> 34:28.047
No, better safe than sorry.

34:28.125 --> 34:29.490
Concussions
and things like that,

34:29.567 --> 34:30.525
You never know.

34:36.141 --> 34:37.215
You wanna call that in?

34:37.250 --> 34:38.992
Sure.

34:39.619 --> 34:40.660
Come on.

34:40.737 --> 34:49.795
(♪♪♪)

34:57.095 --> 34:58.887
Oh, man.

34:59.473 --> 35:02.173
(sighs)

35:02.250 --> 35:04.359
Do you want me
to stay with you tonight?

35:04.435 --> 35:05.852
I don't think that's necessary.

35:07.331 --> 35:09.981
Hey, I-- I was talkin'
to jeff earlier

35:10.016 --> 35:11.107
While you were with the doctor,

35:11.276 --> 35:14.336
And he said something
that had me thinking.

35:14.338 --> 35:16.488
What?

35:16.523 --> 35:19.341
Do you think
this could have been alex?

35:19.376 --> 35:21.368
What? Never.

35:22.954 --> 35:25.121
Then why was your portrait
the only painting

35:25.123 --> 35:26.164
That was taken?

35:26.199 --> 35:30.669
Think about it, natalie.
Your parents owned a museum.

35:30.671 --> 35:33.296
The paintings in your house
are worth a fortune,

35:33.298 --> 35:35.023
But that's all they took?

35:35.058 --> 35:37.008
Alex would never do that.
He would never hurt me.

35:37.043 --> 35:38.677
Even if he wanted his paintings
back,

35:38.712 --> 35:40.970
I interrupted
the middle of a robbery.

35:40.972 --> 35:42.013
Who knows
what they would have taken

35:42.048 --> 35:44.624
If I hadn't walked in?

35:44.701 --> 35:46.959
Listen to yourself.
You interrupted a robbery.

35:46.961 --> 35:52.131
Okay, listen, it's getting
late, and I'm staying here.

35:52.209 --> 35:53.441
Let's go inside.

36:10.001 --> 36:10.842
Good morning.

36:10.877 --> 36:11.651
Thank you.

36:11.728 --> 36:13.336
Maya:
How you feelin' today?

36:13.338 --> 36:14.762
I have a knot
in the back of my head,

36:14.764 --> 36:17.816
But all things considered,
not so bad.

36:17.851 --> 36:20.101
Why don't I plan on staying
with you again tonight?

36:20.178 --> 36:21.386
Oh, no.

36:21.421 --> 36:22.721
Officer baker said
that people break in

36:22.756 --> 36:24.890
During funerals all the time.

36:25.742 --> 36:27.684
Especially if the person
had money.

36:28.595 --> 36:29.978
That's horrible.

36:30.847 --> 36:32.664
I know, it's sad.

36:32.666 --> 36:35.533
But I do appreciate you staying
with me last night.

36:35.568 --> 36:39.028
Why don't I make us
some breakfast this morning?

36:39.030 --> 36:40.071
That'd be really nice.

36:40.682 --> 36:49.789
(♪♪♪)

36:55.805 --> 37:04.763
(♪♪♪)

37:05.115 --> 37:06.781
She's beautiful.

37:06.816 --> 37:08.350
Who?

37:08.385 --> 37:11.228
Your mystery woman. Who is she?

37:13.064 --> 37:14.940
Someone I thought I knew.

37:17.494 --> 37:19.903
Reminds me
of your painting of dad.

37:23.592 --> 37:25.158
I love that painting.

37:32.842 --> 37:35.627
So you gonna tell me
what happened last night?

37:35.662 --> 37:38.171
Showed up on my doorstep,
covered in blood.

37:39.757 --> 37:42.683
I'm not the only one
who's worried.

37:42.760 --> 37:44.594
Mom's been calling.

37:46.022 --> 37:48.164
Did you disconnect your phone?

37:48.241 --> 37:49.607
I didn't disconnect it.

37:49.684 --> 37:52.935
I just turned it off
for a while.

37:52.937 --> 37:55.497
I'm worried about you, too.

37:55.532 --> 37:57.816
I mean,
are you in some kinda trouble?

38:05.391 --> 38:07.158
(sighs)

38:07.160 --> 38:09.761
You gonna do this?

38:09.796 --> 38:10.695
I mean, dad would be--

38:10.772 --> 38:12.213
I'm not dad!

38:12.215 --> 38:21.172
(♪♪♪)

38:22.375 --> 38:23.949
(sighs)

38:24.027 --> 38:33.018
(♪♪♪)

38:55.742 --> 38:56.182
(screams)

38:56.242 --> 38:58.710
(gasps, sighs)

38:58.712 --> 38:59.760
Oh my god.

38:59.837 --> 39:00.261
(laughs)

39:00.263 --> 39:01.795
You scared me.

39:01.797 --> 39:03.181
I guess we're even.

39:03.216 --> 39:04.466
Sorry, I didn't see you in here.

39:04.468 --> 39:07.052
Did you need somethin'
from my dad's office?

39:07.087 --> 39:10.771
Uh, yeah, just uh,
just some payroll information.

39:10.773 --> 39:12.891
Wouldn't the accountants
have that?

39:12.893 --> 39:15.593
You know what? You're right.

39:15.670 --> 39:18.270
Oh, you-- I see
you took it out of the study.

39:18.272 --> 39:19.680
Natalie:
Yeah, good thing, too.

39:20.274 --> 39:22.016
Someone broke into the house
last night.

39:22.093 --> 39:24.527
Wha-- what?
What-- what happened?

39:24.529 --> 39:26.921
Luckily or unluckily,
I interrupted them

39:26.956 --> 39:29.107
And they were only able
to take one painting.

39:29.183 --> 39:31.076
Are you okay?

39:31.078 --> 39:32.017
I'm fine.

39:32.128 --> 39:33.294
I went to the hospital
and got checked out.

39:33.296 --> 39:34.913
Oh, thank god.

39:34.948 --> 39:37.022
You know, I could uh,
take that off your hands,

39:37.100 --> 39:38.299
Add it to the catalog?

39:38.376 --> 39:38.917
Mm, not yet.

39:39.086 --> 39:41.026
I'm still waitin'
on the provenance.

39:41.104 --> 39:42.211
Oh, I could do that.

39:42.213 --> 39:43.605
Thanks,
but I'm kinda countin' on you

39:43.640 --> 39:47.716
To keep the museum runnin'
while I learn the ropes.

39:47.718 --> 39:49.611
I know how much you love
that painting.

39:49.646 --> 39:52.964
I've always loved it, too.
It's one of my favorites.

39:53.074 --> 39:54.315
I was hoping
that if we cleared it,

39:54.350 --> 39:56.101
Then maybe we could exhibit it.

39:58.972 --> 40:00.121
Great.

40:00.123 --> 40:03.307
Uh, I'll just--
I'll leave you to your work.

40:03.309 --> 40:04.359
Okay.

40:08.824 --> 40:17.914
(♪♪♪)

40:25.857 --> 40:28.049
Hey, you look good!

40:28.084 --> 40:28.916
Liar.

40:28.993 --> 40:30.851
How you holdin' up?

40:30.853 --> 40:31.744
It's been tough,

40:31.746 --> 40:33.513
But I'm glad maya stayed
with me last night.

40:34.916 --> 40:35.990
Is this a social visit

40:36.025 --> 40:37.934
Or are you here
to paint with us?

40:38.861 --> 40:41.563
Oh, come on.
It'll be good for you.

40:41.598 --> 40:45.449
When was the last time
you picked up a paintbrush?

40:45.451 --> 40:46.818
I'm actually here to see you.

40:48.554 --> 40:50.280
Have you heard from alex?

40:51.933 --> 40:52.873
I'm sorry.

40:53.026 --> 40:55.910
And you honestly have no idea
where he could have gone?

40:59.716 --> 41:01.290
I knew I should have told
the truth about my family

41:01.292 --> 41:03.960
When things started
to get serious.

41:06.297 --> 41:09.882
So you're really
gonna be runnin' the freeman?

41:09.884 --> 41:12.302
My dad's attorneys
are finalizing it now.

41:14.147 --> 41:16.789
Well, I still think you should
make time to paint.

41:16.866 --> 41:18.016
For you.

41:19.202 --> 41:20.125
I'm hoping
to do a little painting

41:20.370 --> 41:22.370
Back in the office
when I have some free time.

41:22.372 --> 41:25.056
Like my mom used to do.

41:25.132 --> 41:27.400
Oh god, you guys would
have loved my mom.

41:29.488 --> 41:33.247
Oh, actually,
I almost forgot something.

41:33.324 --> 41:37.068
I have each of these
for you guys.

41:38.162 --> 41:40.288
I was hopin' that you both would
submit one of your paintings

41:40.323 --> 41:42.707
To the future master
art exhibit.

41:42.742 --> 41:46.260
My mom started it
right before she died.

41:46.262 --> 41:47.836
She thought
it was really important

41:47.838 --> 41:49.764
That talented young artists
have a chance

41:49.766 --> 41:52.884
That they might not
otherwise get.

41:52.886 --> 41:54.385
Really?

41:54.420 --> 41:57.889
You really wanna put our artwork
in an exhibit at the freeman?

42:01.002 --> 42:02.894
You both deserve it.

42:03.563 --> 42:06.564
(sobs)

42:09.861 --> 42:11.844
Wow. Thank you.

42:12.346 --> 42:13.905
I gotta get back to the museum.

42:13.907 --> 42:15.197
I'll catch up with you guys
later.

42:15.275 --> 42:16.199
Jeff:
All right.

42:18.453 --> 42:20.495
(chuckles)

42:22.039 --> 42:23.414
Oh, man.

42:26.027 --> 42:27.293
Natalie:
Come in.

42:28.621 --> 42:30.121
Flora:
There's a friend
of your father's here.

42:30.197 --> 42:31.697
Danielle abbott.

42:31.775 --> 42:33.941
She said you spoke
at the funeral.

42:33.943 --> 42:35.426
Thank you, flora.
Please send her in.

42:35.461 --> 42:36.553
Okay.

42:38.456 --> 42:39.931
Right this way.

42:40.650 --> 42:41.699
I'm sorry.

42:41.701 --> 42:42.400
(chuckles)

42:42.535 --> 42:43.868
I'm used to working
with your dad.

42:43.870 --> 42:45.419
I guess I should have called.

42:45.497 --> 42:46.846
That's okay.

42:46.923 --> 42:48.322
Please have a seat.

42:48.674 --> 42:51.142
Flora just likes to protect me.

42:51.177 --> 42:54.061
Things have been a little bit
crazy around here lately.

42:54.096 --> 42:57.906
Yeah. You've been through a lot.

42:57.908 --> 42:59.567
How're you holding up?

42:59.644 --> 43:02.753
Honestly,
it's a little overwhelmin'.

43:02.830 --> 43:05.506
But I'm sure
that's not why you're here.

43:05.583 --> 43:07.658
I'm afraid
that what I have to say

43:07.735 --> 43:10.003
Isn't going to make things
any easier.

43:12.232 --> 43:15.741
When I was talking to your dad
at the exhibit opening,

43:15.819 --> 43:19.137
I didn't know anything
about his heart problems.

43:20.006 --> 43:21.263
Yeah.

43:21.265 --> 43:24.191
He wanted everyone
to think he was invincible.

43:24.268 --> 43:27.328
Yeah. That sounds like robert.

43:27.363 --> 43:32.024
But if I had known,
I wouldn't have done anything

43:32.026 --> 43:33.901
To upset him that night.

43:35.037 --> 43:36.487
What is it?

43:43.045 --> 43:44.495
Take a look.

43:52.538 --> 43:53.796
Wait.

43:53.798 --> 43:56.190
You think that the cantor
is a forgery?

43:56.225 --> 43:57.466
A couple of weeks ago,

43:57.468 --> 44:00.227
A close friend of mine mentioned
how excited he was

44:00.229 --> 44:02.229
To purchase the cantor.

44:02.306 --> 44:04.782
So you can imagine my concern
when I saw it hanging

44:04.817 --> 44:06.059
In the museum the other night.

44:06.135 --> 44:07.018
Well, how do you know

44:07.053 --> 44:08.311
That your friend's
isn't a forgery?

44:09.964 --> 44:12.072
I appraised it.

44:12.149 --> 44:13.441
Yours is a forgery.

44:15.411 --> 44:16.694
This doesn't even
make any sense.

44:16.729 --> 44:18.804
My father would make sure
to authenticate every piece

44:18.882 --> 44:21.140
Of artwork before he hangs it
up in his museum.

44:21.217 --> 44:23.201
Our name is everything.

44:23.236 --> 44:24.369
I know.

44:25.496 --> 44:27.071
What else is goin' on?

44:27.874 --> 44:32.543
I'm concerned that you may have
other forgeries.

44:32.578 --> 44:35.154
Why would you say that?

44:35.231 --> 44:38.323
When I spoke to your father,

44:38.401 --> 44:39.992
He told me
that it wasn't the first time

44:39.994 --> 44:41.435
That this had happened.

44:41.512 --> 44:42.937
So when I walked in here,

44:43.013 --> 44:46.073
I looked at a couple of
your other paintings.

44:46.075 --> 44:49.501
The franklin
doesn't even have a signature.

44:49.929 --> 44:52.930
I mean, natalie, it's a darcy.

44:53.007 --> 44:54.982
It should have his signature.

44:56.085 --> 44:59.011
You really need to go
to the authorities.

44:59.088 --> 45:00.195
Of course.

45:00.197 --> 45:03.699
But my family's museum
and the reputation

45:03.701 --> 45:05.493
Is on the line here.

45:06.796 --> 45:09.430
This could ruin everything
that my parents worked so hard

45:09.465 --> 45:10.748
To build.

45:10.783 --> 45:14.502
I'll try to buy you some time
with my friend.

45:14.537 --> 45:16.295
But the longer you wait,

45:16.372 --> 45:17.488
The more people
are going to think

45:17.565 --> 45:19.424
That you have something to hide.

45:20.551 --> 45:21.200
I understand.

45:21.277 --> 45:23.218
(sniffles)

45:23.220 --> 45:24.554
Thank you.

45:27.984 --> 45:31.018
(indistinct chatter)

45:31.454 --> 45:40.445
(♪♪♪)

45:43.616 --> 45:44.248
Miss freeman!

45:44.384 --> 45:46.984
Oh, tina. Call me “natalie”.

45:47.061 --> 45:48.502
Okay, then, natalie,

45:48.504 --> 45:50.588
I know the freeman
is your museum,

45:50.664 --> 45:53.081
But photographing the paintings
is not allowed.

45:53.083 --> 45:55.126
Some of our visitors
have complained.

45:57.338 --> 45:58.045
I'm sorry.

45:58.080 --> 45:59.738
I didn't know you enforced
that rule.

45:59.816 --> 46:01.315
Yes, ma'am. Strictly.

46:01.350 --> 46:03.301
Maybe you can take the photos
after hours,

46:03.336 --> 46:05.369
Or if I'm not mistaken,

46:05.446 --> 46:07.195
The museum
has professional photographs

46:07.197 --> 46:09.890
Of each of the paintings
on file.

46:10.042 --> 46:12.334
Well, I guess I'll have to see
what we have on the file.

46:12.896 --> 46:15.771
And, tina, thanks
for doing such a great job

46:15.773 --> 46:17.648
At enforcing museum rules.

46:27.393 --> 46:36.250
(♪♪♪)

46:42.208 --> 46:51.307
(♪♪♪)

47:09.643 --> 47:10.993
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

47:10.995 --> 47:12.903
I was researchin' a paintin'
and I lost track of time.

47:12.980 --> 47:15.373
Don't worry about it.
Derek and I got you covered.

47:15.408 --> 47:17.241
Natalie:
Great. Thank you.
So what'd I miss?

47:17.318 --> 47:19.877
Oh, um, okay, a few phone calls.

47:19.912 --> 47:22.154
And a young lady
dropped a submission off

47:22.231 --> 47:23.414
For the art exhibit.

47:23.490 --> 47:24.431
Okay, great.

47:24.508 --> 47:25.082
Um, did you set up
an appointment

47:25.251 --> 47:26.675
So I could review her work?

47:26.677 --> 47:27.159
No.

47:27.328 --> 47:28.102
She just
dropped the painting off

47:28.437 --> 47:29.845
For you to review,
but I can go get it.

47:29.847 --> 47:31.346
Uh, yeah, that'd be great.

47:31.348 --> 47:32.723
Um, I'm gonna set the stuff
down and make a cup of coffee,

47:32.725 --> 47:34.274
And then I'll take a look at it.

47:34.351 --> 47:35.442
Well, I just made a fresh pot.

47:35.444 --> 47:37.578
Mm, you do know how
to keep the freeman running.

47:37.580 --> 47:38.762
All right,
let me grab that for you.

47:38.839 --> 47:40.605
Great. Thank you.

47:40.607 --> 47:49.574
(♪♪♪)

47:54.046 --> 47:56.955
(indistinct conversation
in distance)

47:56.957 --> 48:05.923
(♪♪♪)

48:07.701 --> 48:08.559
(both chuckle)

48:08.635 --> 48:09.543
Okay.

48:09.620 --> 48:12.296
(kisses)

48:12.373 --> 48:14.465
(indistinct conversation)

48:14.541 --> 48:23.566
(♪♪♪)

48:24.910 --> 48:27.278
Hi. So here's this.

48:27.280 --> 48:28.220
Thank you.

48:28.297 --> 48:30.990
And this.

48:33.577 --> 48:34.285
Mm.

48:35.729 --> 48:38.705
Well,
this is actually really good.

48:38.707 --> 48:40.332
Very emotional.

48:40.334 --> 48:41.584
Flora:
I agree.

48:42.628 --> 48:44.678
Tell me a little bit more
about the artist.

48:44.680 --> 48:46.088
What is she like?

48:46.090 --> 48:47.164
Well,
I actually don't know anything

48:47.241 --> 48:48.073
About the artist.

48:48.317 --> 48:49.650
The young woman dropped it off
for someone

48:49.685 --> 48:51.743
Who wishes to remain anonymous.

48:51.821 --> 48:54.488
Anonymous? That's weird.

48:54.523 --> 48:56.248
I thought that was strange, too.

48:56.325 --> 48:57.975
I mean, I've been working here
a long time,

48:58.010 --> 49:00.177
And I've never heard
of an aspiring painter

49:00.254 --> 49:02.087
Who wants to remain anonymous.

49:02.165 --> 49:03.271
The whole point
of having your work

49:03.273 --> 49:05.532
In an exhibit
is to become known.

49:05.609 --> 49:07.026
Natalie:
Yeah, I agree.

49:09.605 --> 49:11.489
Thanks, flora.

49:25.988 --> 49:28.972
Alex:
Hey.

49:29.049 --> 49:29.865
Something wrong?

49:29.942 --> 49:32.376
Where's my painting of dad?

49:32.453 --> 49:33.594
What do you mean?

49:33.629 --> 49:36.380
What did you do
with my painting?

49:36.457 --> 49:38.015
Harper.

49:39.293 --> 49:40.400
I took it to the freeman.

49:40.477 --> 49:42.019
You did what?

49:42.054 --> 49:44.312
I don't want anything
to do with the freeman.

49:44.314 --> 49:45.856
But you had the flyer!

49:45.891 --> 49:50.244
And you're so talented, alex.
Everyone should see your work.

49:50.279 --> 49:52.379
And you're right,
you're not dad.

49:52.548 --> 49:54.823
You can do what he couldn't.

49:54.825 --> 49:57.551
But you've gotta
get your work out there.

49:57.553 --> 49:59.495
Let people see it.

50:01.708 --> 50:03.590
I'm trying to help you.

50:03.592 --> 50:07.378
You wanna help me?
Get my painting back.

50:07.488 --> 50:16.512
(♪♪♪)

50:30.344 --> 50:32.761
Flora. What's wrong?

50:32.763 --> 50:33.778
Oh, sorry.

50:33.780 --> 50:34.822
Is everything okay?

50:34.857 --> 50:35.823
Flora:
Yeah.

50:36.850 --> 50:39.184
The photographer
from the opening

50:39.262 --> 50:42.413
Of the last art exhibit
had these couriered over today.

50:43.750 --> 50:44.915
From the night dad died?

50:44.917 --> 50:49.045
Hmm. And they're beautiful.

50:49.922 --> 50:52.006
You're really gonna love them.

50:54.210 --> 50:55.642
I think it's better
that I look at these

50:55.719 --> 50:56.535
A little bit later.

50:56.537 --> 50:59.380
I think that is very wise.

50:59.415 --> 51:02.600
You know, dad really loved you.

51:03.210 --> 51:07.170
He and your mom
were like family to me, so..

51:07.248 --> 51:09.940
He's lucky to have you
as long as he did.

51:12.219 --> 51:14.328
I'm getting ready
to go meet luke at vieste.

51:14.404 --> 51:16.330
Why don't I walk you out?

51:16.332 --> 51:17.782
That sounds great.

51:24.657 --> 51:26.624
(indistinct chatter
in background)

51:28.461 --> 51:31.837
So, you think there are
forgeries hanging in the museum?

51:33.073 --> 51:33.997
What are you gonna do?

51:34.074 --> 51:35.165
I don't know.

51:35.242 --> 51:36.241
Right now, I'm just tryin'
to figure out

51:36.410 --> 51:38.076
Exactly how many paintings
are involved.

51:38.078 --> 51:38.803
I just sort of feel

51:38.971 --> 51:40.554
Like I'm letting
my entire family down.

51:40.589 --> 51:41.271
(sighs)

51:41.365 --> 51:42.515
How's any of this your fault?

51:42.591 --> 51:43.641
Good evening.

51:43.643 --> 51:44.749
Oh! Tony.

51:44.827 --> 51:46.935
We actually have the osso buco
for the gentleman.

51:46.937 --> 51:47.527
Thank you.

51:47.588 --> 51:48.679
And my mother's famous meatball.

51:48.755 --> 51:50.030
Oh! Thank you.

51:50.107 --> 51:50.514
Enjoy.

51:50.591 --> 51:51.398
Looks delicious.

51:51.400 --> 51:52.757
Thanks, tony.

51:52.835 --> 51:55.820
(indistinct chatter)

52:03.545 --> 52:05.955
Do you wanna look through
the photos together?

52:07.124 --> 52:08.499
That'd be great.

52:20.571 --> 52:22.054
Take your time.

52:28.795 --> 52:30.404
(chuckles)

52:30.406 --> 52:31.980
That's a great picture
of you two.

52:31.982 --> 52:33.540
I agree.

52:33.575 --> 52:35.726
God, I'm so glad I have this.

52:35.802 --> 52:38.712
I can't remember the last time
I took a photo with my dad.

52:38.714 --> 52:40.489
Graduation maybe.

52:44.019 --> 52:46.745
Oh, I love this one.

52:46.822 --> 52:48.914
Looks like you guys are sharing
a secret.

52:51.835 --> 52:54.753
God, I wish I could remember
what he was telling me.

52:58.551 --> 52:59.841
Wait.

52:59.843 --> 53:01.935
He-- he was wearin' it.

53:02.012 --> 53:02.769
What?

53:02.846 --> 53:04.179
The pendant
with the medicine in it.

53:04.181 --> 53:05.422
He was wearin' it
the night he died.

53:05.499 --> 53:07.391
I knew it! He always wore it!

53:07.426 --> 53:10.777
Maybe it fell off when he tried
to take the medicine that night.

53:10.812 --> 53:11.778
Or maybe it rolled
under his desk

53:11.855 --> 53:13.004
During all the commotion.

53:13.082 --> 53:14.899
I should look
at the office tomorrow.

53:16.009 --> 53:17.902
Natalie, listen.

53:17.904 --> 53:20.754
I know you wanna
find that pendant,

53:20.789 --> 53:23.199
But you know
it's not gonna change anything.

53:24.610 --> 53:25.517
(sighs)

53:25.594 --> 53:27.294
I know. I just--

53:27.371 --> 53:28.078
(sighs)

53:28.431 --> 53:31.539
I really need to figure out
what happened that night.

53:31.541 --> 53:39.757
(♪♪♪)

53:42.478 --> 53:43.010
(♪♪♪)

53:47.541 --> 53:56.565
(♪♪♪)

54:06.494 --> 54:07.634
(chuckles)

54:07.636 --> 54:09.662
What are you doing?
You need a hand?

54:11.039 --> 54:13.415
No, um, I was--

54:13.417 --> 54:15.476
I was looking
for my dad's pendant.

54:15.478 --> 54:17.010
He was wearin' it that night
at the exhibit.

54:17.087 --> 54:19.797
And I thought
that maybe it fell,

54:19.799 --> 54:21.298
Rolled under the desk, um...

54:22.684 --> 54:23.341
(natalie sobs)

54:23.586 --> 54:27.237
You found him right here,
right?

54:27.239 --> 54:28.806
Yeah.

54:30.500 --> 54:32.935
Your father was a great mentor
to me.

54:35.605 --> 54:36.647
Uh, look, I'm-- I'm sorry.

54:36.682 --> 54:38.015
I'm--
I'm gonna give you some space.

54:38.091 --> 54:38.983
No, it's okay.

54:39.018 --> 54:42.026
I was um, actually coming
to find you.

54:42.028 --> 54:43.821
Um, can I ask you something?

54:43.930 --> 54:45.705
Sure.

54:45.782 --> 54:47.357
Do you have a list
of all the paintings

54:47.434 --> 54:50.452
That we've loaned out
the last couple years?

54:50.454 --> 54:52.846
You know what?
Uh, flora has that list.

54:52.881 --> 54:53.664
Why? Is there something wrong?

54:53.866 --> 54:55.682
Um, no, I just got a request
for a paintin'

54:55.717 --> 54:58.535
And I wanted to see
how we handled things.

54:58.537 --> 55:00.887
Also, do you have um, an area
that you're keepin'

55:00.964 --> 55:02.797
All the future master
submissions?

55:02.799 --> 55:04.057
Okay,
everything we received so far

55:04.134 --> 55:05.526
Is in the back storeroom.

55:05.561 --> 55:06.468
Do you have another one for me?

55:06.512 --> 55:08.295
Uh, yeah, it's actually
right over there.

55:08.372 --> 55:17.396
(♪♪♪)

55:19.299 --> 55:20.040
(chuckles)

55:20.075 --> 55:22.592
Artists are so weird.

55:22.670 --> 55:23.694
What is it?

55:23.696 --> 55:25.395
There's no signature on it.

55:25.548 --> 55:28.231
Why would you submit something
to the future master's exhibit

55:28.308 --> 55:29.566
And not sign it?

55:29.568 --> 55:32.160
The whole point of the exhibit
is to give exposure

55:32.162 --> 55:33.420
To new artists.

55:33.422 --> 55:35.647
Yeah, that's weird.
That's what flora said, too.

55:35.649 --> 55:37.224
Well, you know, great minds.

55:37.259 --> 55:37.924
Wait, stop.

55:37.926 --> 55:40.093
I actually didn't realize that.

55:40.170 --> 55:41.562
Maybe I should contact
the artist

55:41.597 --> 55:44.022
And see if they wanna
add their signature to it.

55:44.024 --> 55:45.382
Works for me.

55:53.559 --> 55:57.269
I didn't know you
had a significant other.

55:58.731 --> 56:02.173
Yeah, he was pretty special.

56:02.175 --> 56:03.734
Was?

56:04.253 --> 56:06.862
Unfortunately,
it didn't work out.

56:08.348 --> 56:11.199
You deserve to be happy.

56:11.201 --> 56:20.167
(♪♪♪)

56:28.143 --> 56:37.184
(♪♪♪)

56:39.955 --> 56:40.971
Natalie:
Flora!

56:41.006 --> 56:42.055
Yeah?

56:42.132 --> 56:44.274
Can you get me the file on that
anonymous artist submission?

56:44.276 --> 56:45.626
Sure, I'll bring it right in.

56:45.661 --> 56:46.634
Natalie:
Okay.

56:46.745 --> 56:47.611
And then derek told me
that we have a list

56:47.963 --> 56:49.646
Of all the paintings
that we've loaned out.

56:49.798 --> 56:50.964
I'd like to see that, too.

56:50.966 --> 56:53.634
Of course, but that list
hasn't been updated

56:53.669 --> 56:54.726
In quite a while.

56:54.728 --> 56:56.836
I mean, your dad
stopped lending paintings out

56:56.913 --> 56:59.005
A couple years ago.

56:59.007 --> 57:00.307
Not even the cantor?

57:00.734 --> 57:04.086
Never the cantor.
That was your mom's favorite.

57:04.797 --> 57:05.845
Huh.

57:05.922 --> 57:14.805
(♪♪♪)

57:20.862 --> 57:29.820
(♪♪♪)

57:39.331 --> 57:40.614
So I have the information

57:40.690 --> 57:42.115
On the anonymous
artist submission,

57:42.117 --> 57:43.883
But I'm so sorry,
I didn't realize

57:43.960 --> 57:47.688
That she didn't fill it out
completely or really at all.

57:47.690 --> 57:49.206
She only wrote down
her first name and phone number?

57:49.282 --> 57:51.024
Yeah, I mean,
I should have caught that,

57:51.059 --> 57:52.951
But it is so unusual
for someone

57:52.953 --> 57:54.803
To not fill out the application
entirely,

57:54.880 --> 57:56.863
So I'm sorry about that.

57:56.898 --> 57:58.139
As long as this
is her real number,

57:58.141 --> 57:59.366
This is all
I should really need.

57:59.401 --> 58:00.701
-Okay, good.
-Natalie: Yeah.

58:00.736 --> 58:02.485
Would you mind closing
the doors on your way out?

58:02.562 --> 58:03.911
Flora:
Of course.

58:03.913 --> 58:12.779
(♪♪♪)

58:18.946 --> 58:27.836
(♪♪♪)

58:31.250 --> 58:32.590
Hello.

58:32.592 --> 58:35.185
Hi, uh, this is natalie freeman
from the freeman museum.

58:35.220 --> 58:36.595
I was trying to reach harper.

58:37.514 --> 58:38.772
This is harper.

58:38.848 --> 58:40.824
<i> Hi, I wanted to</i> talk to you
about the painting

58:40.859 --> 58:42.008
That you dropped off.

58:42.161 --> 58:42.917
<i> I wanted to get a--</i>

58:43.162 --> 58:45.395
Um, I'll be coming by later
to pick it up.

58:46.098 --> 58:47.522
What?

58:47.524 --> 58:50.358
Um, I-- I need it back.

58:50.602 --> 58:53.987
The um,
<i> the artist changed their mind.</i>

58:55.265 --> 58:57.107
Uh, I'm sorry
to have wasted your time.

58:57.183 --> 59:00.001
Oh, you didn't bother me at all.

59:00.003 --> 59:01.928
I actually think
the painting's wonderful.

59:01.963 --> 59:03.688
I think
the artist shows true potential.

59:03.766 --> 59:06.883
<i> Thank you</i> , but um,
they're just not interested.

59:06.885 --> 59:09.211
Please, can we meet for coffee
to discuss it?

59:10.939 --> 59:12.639
<i> Please, just give me a chance.</i>

59:12.716 --> 59:15.175
If you want it back after that,
I'll understand.

59:17.554 --> 59:19.203
Okay, I can meet you.

59:19.281 --> 59:22.557
How about the coffee shop
on 11th?

59:22.559 --> 59:23.784
Perfect.

59:23.819 --> 59:25.477
<i> Great.</i> I'll see you then.

59:33.236 --> 59:42.160
(♪♪♪)

59:47.126 --> 59:48.341
(sighs)

59:48.343 --> 59:57.342
(♪♪♪)

01:00:02.248 --> 01:00:04.691
What are you up to, alex?

01:00:04.693 --> 01:00:06.143
Are you okay?

01:00:06.995 --> 01:00:08.127
(sighs)

01:00:08.205 --> 01:00:09.195
Natalie:
Not really.

01:00:09.631 --> 01:00:13.608
Um, I have an appointment,
but I wanted to talk to you.

01:00:13.610 --> 01:00:14.484
Privately.

01:00:14.486 --> 01:00:15.368
Okay.

01:00:15.445 --> 01:00:17.011
Can you stay late?

01:00:17.013 --> 01:00:17.937
Yes, of course.

01:00:18.014 --> 01:00:19.940
I need you to do something
for me.

01:00:19.942 --> 01:00:21.658
I'll meet you
in my office later on tonight.

01:00:28.291 --> 01:00:30.708
Hey you.

01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:32.051
What did natalie want?

01:00:32.053 --> 01:00:35.221
She wants my help
with something.

01:00:35.298 --> 01:00:36.239
What?

01:00:36.316 --> 01:00:38.549
She didn't say.

01:00:38.551 --> 01:00:40.468
Okay, but you didn't tell her
about us, right?

01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:41.544
Thought we're keeping that
a secret.

01:00:41.546 --> 01:00:43.013
With all that she's going on,

01:00:43.048 --> 01:00:44.214
I'm sure she doesn't care
that we're dating.

01:00:44.566 --> 01:00:48.568
I-- I know, but I'd prefer
if we kept it a secret, okay?

01:00:48.645 --> 01:00:50.144
Fine.

01:00:50.146 --> 01:00:53.023
It'll be worth it, I promise.
Yeah?

01:00:53.058 --> 01:00:54.215
Yeah.

01:00:54.217 --> 01:01:03.283
(♪♪♪)

01:01:12.077 --> 01:01:15.212
(indistinct chatter

01:01:16.339 --> 01:01:17.338
Are you harper?

01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:17.881
Natalie?

01:01:17.916 --> 01:01:18.882
Yeah.

01:01:18.917 --> 01:01:20.950
Um, I ordered us two espressos,

01:01:21.027 --> 01:01:22.419
But I can get you somethin' else
if you prefer.

01:01:22.454 --> 01:01:24.905
Oh, espresso's great.
You don't have to do that.

01:01:24.940 --> 01:01:26.180
Oh, I'm happy to.

01:01:26.182 --> 01:01:27.407
I just appreciate
you meeting me here

01:01:27.409 --> 01:01:28.684
On such a short notice.

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:32.353
Um, about that,

01:01:32.355 --> 01:01:33.855
There's just no way
I'm gonna be able

01:01:33.857 --> 01:01:36.917
To convince the artist
to show his work at the exhibit.

01:01:36.952 --> 01:01:38.568
But it's a great opportunity.

01:01:38.570 --> 01:01:40.445
I know.

01:01:41.865 --> 01:01:43.456
He just got so mad
when I brought his painting

01:01:43.458 --> 01:01:45.542
To the freeman.

01:01:45.544 --> 01:01:47.877
Was he upset
because you took it to a museum,

01:01:47.912 --> 01:01:50.455
Or because you took
it to the freeman?

01:01:51.667 --> 01:01:53.792
I honestly don't know.

01:01:56.422 --> 01:01:59.256
What if I talk to the artist?

01:01:59.258 --> 01:02:00.623
No!

01:02:00.700 --> 01:02:02.634
Honestly, that would probably
just make everything worse.

01:02:04.763 --> 01:02:07.180
Is the artist tryin'
to hide somethin'?

01:02:08.116 --> 01:02:09.449
I never should have agreed
to meet you.

01:02:09.484 --> 01:02:11.435
I'll come by tomorrow
to pick up the painting.

01:02:11.470 --> 01:02:14.304
Wait. I know it's alex.

01:02:14.380 --> 01:02:23.405
(♪♪♪)

01:02:29.504 --> 01:02:38.503
(♪♪♪)

01:02:44.594 --> 01:02:53.560
(♪♪♪)

01:02:55.864 --> 01:03:04.988
(♪♪♪)

01:03:05.281 --> 01:03:07.157
Did you get it back?

01:03:08.193 --> 01:03:12.219
Um, I'm afraid
I really messed things up.

01:03:12.221 --> 01:03:14.288
What? What did you do now?

01:03:14.290 --> 01:03:17.291
I met with natalie freeman
to get your painting back.

01:03:17.293 --> 01:03:18.368
Did you tell her who I am?

01:03:18.444 --> 01:03:19.794
No! No, I swear.

01:03:19.796 --> 01:03:23.206
But she figured it out.

01:03:23.283 --> 01:03:27.219
Alex, how do you know her?
What's going on?

01:03:31.116 --> 01:03:32.182
You're scaring me.

01:03:32.217 --> 01:03:34.400
Harper, I know you're in there!

01:03:34.477 --> 01:03:35.685
Expecting somebody?

01:03:36.479 --> 01:03:37.403
I'll get rid of her.

01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:39.405
No, let her come in.

01:03:39.407 --> 01:03:41.191
It's time that I deal with her.

01:03:42.468 --> 01:03:45.378
Harper, I'll go to the police!
I need answers!

01:03:45.380 --> 01:03:46.696
I don't like this.

01:03:46.698 --> 01:03:49.366
(sighs)

01:03:53.597 --> 01:03:54.679
Hi.

01:03:54.756 --> 01:03:56.255
How do you know alex?

01:03:56.332 --> 01:03:58.208
Come inside,
I'll explain everything.

01:03:58.210 --> 01:04:00.210
I want you to tell me the truth.

01:04:04.082 --> 01:04:05.339
(scoffs)

01:04:05.341 --> 01:04:06.683
What's goin' on?

01:04:07.201 --> 01:04:10.236
Harper, wanna introduce me
to your friend?

01:04:10.238 --> 01:04:12.806
She looks a lot
like someone I used to know.

01:04:15.685 --> 01:04:17.227
I want my painting back.

01:04:17.262 --> 01:04:18.336
Which one?

01:04:18.338 --> 01:04:19.846
The one that harper brought
over earlier,

01:04:19.923 --> 01:04:21.672
Or the others that are already
prominently hangin' up

01:04:21.750 --> 01:04:23.400
In the freeman?

01:04:25.954 --> 01:04:26.861
(scoffs)

01:04:26.863 --> 01:04:28.362
Yeah,
I guess I'm not the only one

01:04:28.364 --> 01:04:30.365
Having secrets here.

01:04:30.367 --> 01:04:31.657
How many?

01:04:31.659 --> 01:04:32.759
How many what?

01:04:32.794 --> 01:04:34.544
How many forgeries
did you paint?

01:04:34.546 --> 01:04:37.463
It's not what you think.
I was hired to replicate.

01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:38.415
Forge!

01:04:38.450 --> 01:04:40.584
What?
Alex wouldn't paint forgeries.

01:04:40.619 --> 01:04:41.960
Tell her.

01:04:43.972 --> 01:04:47.140
I was painting replicas
for a private collector.

01:04:47.216 --> 01:04:48.441
Or at least
that's what I was told.

01:04:48.476 --> 01:04:49.259
Who told you that?

01:04:49.369 --> 01:04:50.427
My contact.

01:04:50.462 --> 01:04:52.386
He said his client had gotten
too old for museums

01:04:52.388 --> 01:04:55.373
And his family just wanted
to surround him with the art

01:04:55.450 --> 01:04:56.207
That he loves.

01:04:56.284 --> 01:04:57.558
And you believed that?

01:04:57.560 --> 01:04:58.684
I know how it sounds,

01:04:58.686 --> 01:05:01.487
But I really thought
I was helping an old art lover.

01:05:01.564 --> 01:05:02.730
How closely did you look
at them?

01:05:02.732 --> 01:05:03.440
Because I didn't even try

01:05:03.733 --> 01:05:05.158
To replicate
the artists' signatures.

01:05:05.234 --> 01:05:06.610
And if I was
really selling forgeries,

01:05:06.719 --> 01:05:08.695
I would have forged
the signatures, too.

01:05:14.394 --> 01:05:15.818
I just wanted
to make some extra money

01:05:15.820 --> 01:05:18.413
For my sister's college tuition.

01:05:21.234 --> 01:05:23.001
Harper's your sister?

01:05:27.757 --> 01:05:30.233
I knew something was wrong
at the last exchange.

01:05:30.235 --> 01:05:32.027
My contact was really nervous,

01:05:32.103 --> 01:05:33.303
And after he paid me
for the franklin,

01:05:33.338 --> 01:05:34.763
I told him I was done.

01:05:36.758 --> 01:05:37.640
He said that's too bad

01:05:37.684 --> 01:05:40.393
Because my work
even duped the freemans.

01:05:41.529 --> 01:05:43.012
And I tried
getting my paintings back.

01:05:43.089 --> 01:05:45.273
That's when I gashed my arm
and I came here.

01:05:49.846 --> 01:05:50.737
(groans)

01:05:54.283 --> 01:05:57.360
I saw you at the freeman,
taking pictures of the franklin.

01:05:57.437 --> 01:05:58.161
You were there?

01:05:58.196 --> 01:05:59.437
Natalie:
Yeah.

01:05:59.514 --> 01:06:02.182
I walked over to talk to you
and then I saw you wink at tina.

01:06:02.217 --> 01:06:03.416
Is she in on this, too?

01:06:04.352 --> 01:06:04.867
Who's tina?

01:06:04.944 --> 01:06:06.419
The security guard.

01:06:06.421 --> 01:06:09.355
Look, I realized
she saw me taking the pictures

01:06:09.390 --> 01:06:11.282
And I thought maybe
if I gave her a little wink,

01:06:11.359 --> 01:06:12.783
I wouldn't get in trouble
for taking them.

01:06:12.861 --> 01:06:14.644
And she bought that?

01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:15.536
I don't know.

01:06:15.721 --> 01:06:16.863
I got out of there
as fast as I could, but--

01:06:16.898 --> 01:06:18.806
(alex sighs)

01:06:18.808 --> 01:06:19.790
You have to believe me.

01:06:19.868 --> 01:06:21.567
I had no idea
what they were doing

01:06:21.569 --> 01:06:22.560
With my paintings.

01:06:26.407 --> 01:06:28.400
I don't know what to believe
anymore.

01:06:34.883 --> 01:06:36.824
I have an appointment back
at the freeman.

01:06:36.826 --> 01:06:37.917
I gotta go.

01:06:37.994 --> 01:06:40.494
Natalie, wait.

01:06:40.496 --> 01:06:42.329
You should go to the police.

01:06:42.331 --> 01:06:46.259
Why would you say that?
You'll go to jail.

01:06:46.335 --> 01:06:47.151
I might have painted
the pictures,

01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:48.728
But I didn't hang them
in your museum,

01:06:48.763 --> 01:06:51.297
And I didn't steal
the originals.

01:06:52.658 --> 01:06:55.342
Do you know
that this could ruin everything

01:06:55.344 --> 01:06:58.738
That my family worked so hard
to build?

01:06:58.773 --> 01:07:00.439
You need to be careful, natalie.

01:07:00.441 --> 01:07:02.608
Someone inside the freeman
had to have been involved.

01:07:02.685 --> 01:07:03.943
How else
would my paintings be hanging

01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:06.104
In your museum?

01:07:06.181 --> 01:07:08.398
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

01:07:09.568 --> 01:07:11.784
I'm so sorry for everything.

01:07:11.819 --> 01:07:13.737
Please let me help you.

01:07:18.944 --> 01:07:20.159
I gotta go.

01:07:20.161 --> 01:07:29.085
(♪♪♪)

01:07:50.816 --> 01:07:52.074
Hi.

01:07:52.151 --> 01:07:53.643
Um, tina's waiting
in your office.

01:07:53.719 --> 01:07:54.310
Okay, thank you.

01:07:54.629 --> 01:07:57.297
And luke dropped this off
for you.

01:07:57.299 --> 01:07:59.799
He said it was the information
about the artist

01:07:59.801 --> 01:08:02.501
Who painted a father's love.

01:08:02.578 --> 01:08:03.669
I know you really wanted
to find him,

01:08:03.805 --> 01:08:07.915
But sadly he was killed
in a car accident 20 years ago.

01:08:07.917 --> 01:08:09.583
Oh, shoot.

01:08:10.236 --> 01:08:14.864
Natalie, your dad was quoted
in the article about him.

01:08:14.941 --> 01:08:15.698
My dad?

01:08:15.775 --> 01:08:16.674
Yeah.

01:08:18.761 --> 01:08:20.820
Okay, um, I'll look into it.

01:08:20.855 --> 01:08:21.412
Okay.

01:08:21.489 --> 01:08:22.246
Thank you.

01:08:22.324 --> 01:08:31.314
(♪♪♪)

01:08:33.868 --> 01:08:35.793
You look upset. I can come back.

01:08:35.870 --> 01:08:36.986
Natalie:
No.

01:08:37.021 --> 01:08:38.838
I need to figure out
what happened to my father.

01:08:38.873 --> 01:08:40.706
It's eating me up alive.

01:08:40.783 --> 01:08:42.491
How can I help?

01:08:42.569 --> 01:08:44.277
The paramedics told me
that you were on duty

01:08:44.279 --> 01:08:46.121
The night that my father
had a heart attack.

01:08:46.197 --> 01:08:50.516
I was, but, uh,
derek was the one who found him.

01:08:50.551 --> 01:08:52.752
He tried everything to save him.

01:08:55.556 --> 01:08:57.798
Do you remember
if he was wearin' his pendant

01:08:57.800 --> 01:08:59.592
With his medicine in it
that night?

01:09:00.695 --> 01:09:03.346
I'm sorry. I don't remember.

01:09:03.348 --> 01:09:04.622
Did you ask derek?

01:09:04.624 --> 01:09:06.540
Yeah, he doesn't remember.

01:09:07.226 --> 01:09:09.476
I noticed that there was some
surveillance cameras

01:09:09.478 --> 01:09:10.636
Outside my dad's office.

01:09:10.713 --> 01:09:12.522
Can you please bring me
the tapes from that night,

01:09:12.557 --> 01:09:14.390
So I can review them?

01:09:14.467 --> 01:09:15.799
Sure.

01:09:16.378 --> 01:09:19.061
Do you want me to look at it
for you?

01:09:19.063 --> 01:09:21.948
Some of that may be tough
for you to watch.

01:09:23.659 --> 01:09:25.535
Uh, yeah, that's probably
for the better.

01:09:25.570 --> 01:09:26.886
Thank you.

01:09:26.921 --> 01:09:29.497
Let me see what I can find.

01:09:30.141 --> 01:09:31.523
And tina,

01:09:31.601 --> 01:09:33.242
You don't need
to hide your relationship

01:09:33.319 --> 01:09:34.410
With derek to me.

01:09:34.487 --> 01:09:36.820
I saw the two of you earlier
together

01:09:36.898 --> 01:09:38.631
And it's fine.

01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:42.468
Thank you. I appreciate that.

01:09:43.604 --> 01:09:45.054
Can I ask you one more thing?

01:09:45.056 --> 01:09:46.580
Sure.

01:09:47.191 --> 01:09:49.525
What do you know
about the franklin?

01:09:49.602 --> 01:09:53.563
Uh, I'm sorry. I...

01:09:53.598 --> 01:09:55.023
Which one is that?

01:09:56.525 --> 01:09:57.867
I should have told you

01:09:57.943 --> 01:09:59.760
That I don't know that much
about art.

01:09:59.838 --> 01:10:02.012
I didn't know it was
a requirement for the job,

01:10:02.090 --> 01:10:04.824
But I am happy to learn.

01:10:05.944 --> 01:10:08.494
It's not. Thank you.

01:10:11.315 --> 01:10:14.375
Tina, do you have a uh, minute

01:10:14.377 --> 01:10:16.469
To talk
about new security updates?

01:10:16.545 --> 01:10:18.379
Sure. Let's go.

01:10:20.216 --> 01:10:21.774
What did natalie wanna talk
to you about?

01:10:21.776 --> 01:10:23.867
She wants me to look
at the security footage

01:10:23.945 --> 01:10:25.762
From the night her dad died.

01:10:25.797 --> 01:10:28.431
She wants to know
where he lost his pendant.

01:10:28.433 --> 01:10:29.599
Well, that seems like a waste
of time.

01:10:29.634 --> 01:10:32.226
Robert doesn't have any cameras
in his office.

01:10:32.228 --> 01:10:34.561
She asked about the camera
outside his office.

01:10:34.563 --> 01:10:36.606
It won't take me long.

01:10:36.641 --> 01:10:40.067
Or you can say you looked
and saw nothing,

01:10:40.069 --> 01:10:41.560
And you can meet me
on the rooftop

01:10:41.562 --> 01:10:42.862
For some stargazing.

01:10:42.897 --> 01:10:45.031
We haven't done that in a while.

01:10:45.784 --> 01:10:47.283
It's a date then.

01:10:47.318 --> 01:10:48.451
I'll get everything set up.

01:10:48.486 --> 01:10:50.036
Okay.

01:11:01.833 --> 01:11:10.890
(♪♪♪)

01:11:16.664 --> 01:11:17.680
(gasps)

01:11:17.757 --> 01:11:26.823
(♪♪♪)

01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:41.879

01:11:45.677 --> 01:11:47.726

01:11:47.803 --> 01:11:56.728
(♪♪♪)

01:12:02.643 --> 01:12:11.743

01:12:21.245 --> 01:12:22.820
(gasps)

01:12:22.897 --> 01:12:23.913
Hey.

01:12:23.989 --> 01:12:25.882
(derek laughs)

01:12:31.856 --> 01:12:33.848
You looking for this?

01:12:35.076 --> 01:12:37.310
Why would you do that
to mr. Freeman?

01:12:39.622 --> 01:12:41.447
No, what did you do
to mr. Freeman?

01:12:41.449 --> 01:12:43.066
What did you do to mr. Freeman?

01:12:43.101 --> 01:12:44.067
Get off me!

01:12:44.069 --> 01:12:45.777
Shut up! Shut up!

01:12:46.571 --> 01:12:49.405
You couldn't just
leave it alone!

01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:51.698
Why are you doing this?

01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:54.685
The freemans took everything
from me.

01:12:54.762 --> 01:12:56.579
What are you talking about?

01:12:57.615 --> 01:12:58.764
...You taking me.

01:12:58.799 --> 01:13:01.667
(both grunt)

01:13:01.669 --> 01:13:04.003

01:13:08.809 --> 01:13:09.542

01:13:09.577 --> 01:13:11.886
(screams)

01:13:23.082 --> 01:13:25.975
(takes a deep breath)

01:13:25.977 --> 01:13:35.034
(♪♪♪)

01:13:41.125 --> 01:13:50.007

01:13:52.928 --> 01:13:55.263
(indistinct radio chatter)

01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:02.645
This is awful.

01:14:02.647 --> 01:14:04.922
I mean, I just don't believe it.

01:14:05.032 --> 01:14:06.356
I just spoke with her.

01:14:06.358 --> 01:14:07.525
I don't know why she'd
do something like this.

01:14:07.602 --> 01:14:08.867
I have no idea.

01:14:08.944 --> 01:14:10.677
(sobs)

01:14:10.755 --> 01:14:12.621
Natalie.

01:14:12.698 --> 01:14:14.440
Officer baker. What's goin' on?

01:14:14.475 --> 01:14:17.576
Um, why don't we go talk
in your office

01:14:17.578 --> 01:14:19.662
So we can speak privately?

01:14:21.123 --> 01:14:22.381
Excuse us.

01:14:22.458 --> 01:14:25.168
(indistinct radio chatter)

01:14:31.534 --> 01:14:32.708
Uh, why don't you sit down?

01:14:32.785 --> 01:14:34.969
We've got some tough things
to discuss.

01:14:38.666 --> 01:14:39.465
(sighs)

01:14:39.576 --> 01:14:41.124
Do you mind
if I get this real quick?

01:14:41.202 --> 01:14:43.019
Yeah, sure. Go ahead.

01:14:48.659 --> 01:14:50.567
Okay, I'm sorry about that.

01:14:50.569 --> 01:14:55.031
We found this with the body.

01:15:00.705 --> 01:15:03.313
Natalie,
I'm so sorry about everything.

01:15:03.424 --> 01:15:05.090
Your father found out
about the forgeries,

01:15:05.167 --> 01:15:07.660
So I had to do it.

01:15:07.736 --> 01:15:09.045
Tina.

01:15:09.897 --> 01:15:15.092
And we found this
in her hand with the note.

01:15:16.070 --> 01:15:18.221
This doesn't make any sense.

01:15:19.657 --> 01:15:23.250
So you didn't suspect tina
was doin' anything wrong?

01:15:23.328 --> 01:15:25.352
No,
she had me completely fooled.

01:15:25.354 --> 01:15:27.930
I mean, I even had her help me
try and find this.

01:15:28.007 --> 01:15:29.172
Are you saying
you believe her guilt

01:15:29.250 --> 01:15:30.783
Was too much for her?

01:15:30.859 --> 01:15:32.201
Natalie:
I don't know.

01:15:32.277 --> 01:15:33.860
I'm so confused on everything
that's happenin' around here

01:15:33.862 --> 01:15:34.937
Right now.

01:15:35.014 --> 01:15:37.364
Well, that I would agree with.

01:15:37.366 --> 01:15:39.032
A lot has happened
since you've been back

01:15:39.034 --> 01:15:40.618
At the freeman.

01:15:42.871 --> 01:15:45.038
I gotta get back out there
and help,

01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:48.300
But I'll be
paying close attention

01:15:48.302 --> 01:15:50.920
To everything
that goes on around here.

01:15:54.033 --> 01:15:55.550
Come on, bowen.

01:15:57.962 --> 01:16:01.013
(indistinct radio chatter)

01:16:04.585 --> 01:16:08.938
Derek, I'm so sorry.
You must be devastated.

01:16:08.973 --> 01:16:12.775
Yeah, she was uh,
she was a great co-worker.

01:16:13.795 --> 01:16:15.987
Tina told me the two of you guys
were datin'.

01:16:18.116 --> 01:16:19.315
Yeah.

01:16:19.391 --> 01:16:23.135
I just-- I don't know why
she would do that.

01:16:23.137 --> 01:16:25.921
I know. Can I get you anything?

01:16:25.998 --> 01:16:28.832
Coffee? Water?

01:16:28.910 --> 01:16:31.827
You know what?
Water would be great.

01:16:31.829 --> 01:16:33.129
Okay.

01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:36.582
Thank you!

01:16:36.659 --> 01:16:45.683

01:16:54.018 --> 01:16:55.860

01:17:00.900 --> 01:17:02.033
Here you--

01:17:10.059 --> 01:17:19.091

01:17:22.646 --> 01:17:24.305
(grunts, pants)

01:17:24.382 --> 01:17:28.184
You said my art was being sold
to a private collector.

01:17:28.219 --> 01:17:29.352
I lied.

01:17:29.354 --> 01:17:29.869
(chuckles)

01:17:29.871 --> 01:17:32.980
(grunts, pants)

01:17:39.914 --> 01:17:40.829
Natalie:
Robert freeman said

01:17:40.865 --> 01:17:43.741
The death of stephen mason
was a tragedy.

01:17:44.902 --> 01:17:47.911
He was a single father
to an 11-year-old son, derek,

01:17:47.913 --> 01:17:49.747
Who tragically witnessed
the whole thing.

01:17:51.984 --> 01:17:53.084
Dad!

01:17:55.112 --> 01:17:56.854
Derek.

01:17:56.931 --> 01:18:05.888
(♪♪♪)

01:18:18.602 --> 01:18:21.654

01:18:29.864 --> 01:18:31.622
Oh my god! Flora!

01:18:31.699 --> 01:18:32.123
What's wrong?

01:18:32.533 --> 01:18:33.632
Natalie:
Go get officer baker!

01:18:33.876 --> 01:18:35.000
-The police just left!
-I need you to call them now!

01:18:35.035 --> 01:18:36.443
I need to find derek!

01:18:36.521 --> 01:18:37.937
Derek was going
to the loading dock

01:18:37.972 --> 01:18:39.171
Like ten minutes ago!

01:18:46.264 --> 01:18:47.363
I know it was you!

01:18:47.398 --> 01:18:49.932
Tina sent me the video!

01:18:50.559 --> 01:18:51.541
(laughs)

01:18:51.619 --> 01:18:53.635
Your boyfriend's dead
in my trunk.

01:18:53.712 --> 01:18:54.912
What did you do?

01:18:54.914 --> 01:18:56.797
Come on, rich girl!

01:18:57.324 --> 01:18:59.582
I remember exactly who you are!

01:18:59.660 --> 01:19:01.110
I tried to help you
find your dad's painting

01:19:01.145 --> 01:19:01.994
That night!

01:19:02.413 --> 01:19:04.713
He's mad because he can't
find his painting.

01:19:04.715 --> 01:19:06.482
Maybe we can help him find it.

01:19:06.558 --> 01:19:07.983
I can't.
He told me to wait here.

01:19:08.060 --> 01:19:08.992
Natalie:
(overlapping speech)

01:19:09.070 --> 01:19:10.101
My father died

01:19:10.103 --> 01:19:11.912
And you had the painting
all along!

01:19:11.914 --> 01:19:14.331
So you decided
to destroy the freeman!

01:19:14.333 --> 01:19:15.374
You'll regret this!

01:19:16.735 --> 01:19:18.919
I will ruin this museum!

01:19:20.047 --> 01:19:21.513
He said
you were gonna regret it.

01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:23.064
(both yell)

01:19:23.066 --> 01:19:24.175
(groans)

01:19:24.251 --> 01:19:25.634
Derek:
Come on!

01:19:25.669 --> 01:19:27.002
Come on! Let's go, rich girl!

01:19:27.037 --> 01:19:29.187
(yells)

01:19:29.222 --> 01:19:31.039
Come on! Come on!

01:19:31.117 --> 01:19:33.442
(yells)

01:19:33.518 --> 01:19:34.443

(♪♪♪)

01:21:07.738 --> 01:21:10.772
I thought it was appropriate
to hang them side by side,

01:21:10.849 --> 01:21:12.791
The same way they were created.

01:21:12.868 --> 01:21:15.411
This is so exciting.

01:21:16.855 --> 01:21:20.040
I can't believe I have...

01:21:20.518 --> 01:21:21.950
(sighs)

01:21:21.952 --> 01:21:27.623
We have our paintings hanging
in the freeman.

01:21:27.699 --> 01:21:30.308
Exactly where they should be.

01:21:30.310 --> 01:21:31.701
Dad would be so proud.

01:21:31.779 --> 01:21:34.780
I know. It was his dream.

01:21:34.815 --> 01:21:38.142
Actually, harper and I
have a surprise for you.

01:21:39.720 --> 01:21:42.855
(indistinct chatter
in background)

01:21:46.068 --> 01:21:49.445
Harper,
do you wanna do the honors?

01:21:56.328 --> 01:21:57.410
Wow!

01:21:57.412 --> 01:21:58.895
(chuckles)

01:21:58.897 --> 01:22:01.123
After you showed me
your father's work,

01:22:01.125 --> 01:22:02.975
I knew it belonged here, too.

01:22:03.010 --> 01:22:04.234
Harper was kind enough
to give me one

01:22:04.311 --> 01:22:06.236
Of your favorite paintings.

01:22:06.313 --> 01:22:07.587
I hope that's okay.

01:22:07.589 --> 01:22:08.631
It's perfect.

01:22:08.633 --> 01:22:10.240

01:22:31.279 --> 01:22:33.205
You did good.

01:22:33.207 --> 01:22:36.950
I still can't believe we got all
of the original art pieces back.

01:22:36.952 --> 01:22:38.877
You worked hard
to make it happen.

01:22:38.954 --> 01:22:40.012
We worked hard
to make it happen.

01:22:40.164 --> 01:22:42.214
I don't know how I could have
gone through this last year

01:22:42.290 --> 01:22:44.040
Without you.

01:22:44.042 --> 01:22:44.524
You mean that?

01:22:44.635 --> 01:22:46.085
Of course.

01:22:49.573 --> 01:22:52.124
Your parents
would be so proud of you.
