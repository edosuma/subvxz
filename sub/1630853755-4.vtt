WEBVTT

00:14.663 --> 00:16.499
<i>
Her breathing
has become intermittent.</i>

00:18.638 --> 00:20.473
We're approaching the end.

00:23.213 --> 00:25.585
Isn't there something
you can give her for the pain?

00:25.618 --> 00:27.822
I ran out of opium weeks ago.

00:29.593 --> 00:32.632
I'm just not equipped to deal
with this much death.

00:34.368 --> 00:37.074
<i>
Daddy, will she be buried
in a ditch</i>

00:37.107 --> 00:39.546
<i>like the others?</i>

00:39.579 --> 00:40.815
<i>
No, Edward.</i>

00:42.184 --> 00:44.455
<i>Those graves are for the poor.</i>

00:44.488 --> 00:47.227
She'll be buried
in the cemetery.

00:48.698 --> 00:50.735
Next to your sisters.

00:56.312 --> 00:59.653
<i>
Why have our friends
not come to visit this time?</i>

01:02.424 --> 01:04.729
Because all of our friends
are dead.

01:32.251 --> 01:33.921
You may enter.

01:37.762 --> 01:40.868
Welcome to the House of Lazarus.

01:43.406 --> 01:45.545
Under God's eye,

01:45.578 --> 01:48.283
may you enter this space.

01:48.316 --> 01:49.586
Would you like a cup of tea?

01:49.619 --> 01:51.422
No.

02:04.716 --> 02:05.785
As you will.

02:16.540 --> 02:18.242
My name is Celeste.

02:19.211 --> 02:20.748
May I know your name?

02:22.384 --> 02:24.689
I don't have time for theatrics.

02:26.359 --> 02:27.762
Well, then.

02:29.533 --> 02:31.268
Let's get to it.

02:43.961 --> 02:46.198
What the hell is that?

02:47.569 --> 02:49.371
It's what you came here for.

02:50.641 --> 02:53.548
Are you ready for the feast?

02:53.581 --> 02:56.821
Father who art in heaven.

02:58.389 --> 02:59.860
There is no want to worry.

02:59.893 --> 03:02.766
You are a menace to society.

03:02.799 --> 03:05.337
I'm not contagious.

03:05.370 --> 03:07.576
My wounds have
the power to heal.

03:07.609 --> 03:10.748
That's why you're here,
isn't it?

03:10.781 --> 03:12.719
Men seek out my services

03:12.752 --> 03:15.424
so that this plague
will pass over their homes.

03:15.457 --> 03:17.796
They say I have been anointed

03:17.829 --> 03:20.333
by Saint Lazarus.

03:23.339 --> 03:24.843
One lick...

03:26.713 --> 03:27.749
...on my pustules

03:27.782 --> 03:29.586
will ward off

03:29.619 --> 03:32.759
smallpox, indefinitely.

03:35.063 --> 03:37.668
It's warm...

03:39.706 --> 03:41.408
...and sweet.

03:43.446 --> 03:45.718
Every man who has tasted me

03:45.751 --> 03:48.558
has gone on to live

03:48.591 --> 03:50.628
a healthy life.

03:50.661 --> 03:53.032
I promise you.

03:54.503 --> 03:55.604
Come forth.

04:04.488 --> 04:05.991
Close your eyes.

04:11.870 --> 04:13.608
Open your mouth.

04:13.641 --> 04:17.414
Now imagine heaven

04:17.447 --> 04:19.552
on your tongue.

04:39.726 --> 04:41.095
You are an occultist.

04:41.128 --> 04:43.868
So, you only wanted sex, then?

04:43.901 --> 04:45.672
Shame on you,

04:45.705 --> 04:47.374
Pastor Walter.

04:49.913 --> 04:51.750
That is not my name.

04:53.152 --> 04:55.123
I am not he.

04:55.156 --> 04:58.396
I know you are the new minister.
That church

04:58.429 --> 05:01.001
- is a house of lies.
- Blasphemous witch!

05:12.391 --> 05:14.863
If you speak a word
of this to anyone,

05:14.896 --> 05:17.535
I will see to it
that you are hanged.

05:17.568 --> 05:20.107
-

05:24.649 --> 05:25.885
Hypocrite.

06:28.109 --> 06:30.013
An obedient wife.

06:31.482 --> 06:33.052
Devoted mother.

06:34.656 --> 06:37.061
A follower

06:37.094 --> 06:38.898
of Christ.

06:38.931 --> 06:42.639
Because of Eve's original sin,

06:42.672 --> 06:46.445
sickness and suffering
is a part of life.

06:48.483 --> 06:50.153
People of Christ.

06:52.224 --> 06:55.497
Sin does not come without

06:55.531 --> 06:56.934
consequences.

06:56.967 --> 06:59.839
You're going to talk about sin?

07:03.747 --> 07:05.017
Wretched woman.

07:05.050 --> 07:08.691
This man is a false prophet.

07:08.724 --> 07:11.764
Leave this church
and save yourselves.

07:11.797 --> 07:12.966
Begone from this

07:12.999 --> 07:14.569
holy space, idolatress.

07:14.602 --> 07:17.207
He beat me for trying

07:17.240 --> 07:19.145
to heal him.

07:21.182 --> 07:23.587
I visited her,

07:23.620 --> 07:25.924
but only to pray for her soul.

07:27.795 --> 07:32.004
She is a
disease-spreading prostitute.

07:32.037 --> 07:34.174
- Wicked woman.

07:37.882 --> 07:40.521
Don't pretend like
you don't know who I am.

07:40.554 --> 07:44.095
I am the Daughter

07:44.128 --> 07:46.165
of Lazarus.

07:46.198 --> 07:48.771
Today, God

07:48.804 --> 07:52.111
has called upon me

07:52.144 --> 07:55.952
to warn you that this...
this man,

07:55.985 --> 07:57.722
this preacher,

07:57.755 --> 08:01.028
will ring in a new era of death

08:01.061 --> 08:04.268
and destruction, if we let him.

08:04.301 --> 08:07.140
She is no daughter of Lazarus.

08:09.278 --> 08:10.915
She is a daughter

08:10.948 --> 08:13.754
- of Satan himself.
-

08:13.787 --> 08:16.727
She is to blame for our ruin.

08:16.760 --> 08:18.764
She is the source

08:18.797 --> 08:21.069
- of God's wrath.
We must purge

08:21.102 --> 08:22.705
this sorceress
from our community,

08:22.738 --> 08:24.776
for our survival.

08:24.809 --> 08:26.580
String her up

08:26.613 --> 08:28.551
and send her to the gallows!

08:28.584 --> 08:30.655
- Whore!
- Hang her now!

08:30.688 --> 08:33.326
Defend us in battle,
Prince of the Heavenly Host.

08:33.359 --> 08:35.965
Be our protection

08:35.998 --> 08:37.669
- against the wickedness...
-

08:37.702 --> 08:39.305
and snares of the devil.

08:39.338 --> 08:41.242
Enough!

08:41.275 --> 08:43.547
Sit down.

08:47.020 --> 08:50.694
I will not have my wife's
funeral marred with a hanging.

08:59.178 --> 09:02.652
<i>
We haven't known each other
for terribly long, but I</i>

09:02.685 --> 09:04.823
consider you a friend, Thomas.

09:04.856 --> 09:07.261
Thank you, Pastor.

09:07.294 --> 09:09.331
As I do you.

09:09.364 --> 09:13.239
So, I may speak freely then,
and you won't take any offense?

09:13.272 --> 09:15.277
I would hope so,

09:15.310 --> 09:16.814
and that you would grant me

09:16.847 --> 09:18.818
- the same grace.
- Good.

09:18.851 --> 09:22.057
Don't ever challenge
my authority like that again.

09:22.090 --> 09:24.161
This congregation needs
a strong leader,

09:24.194 --> 09:25.931
and I won't have you
weakening me.

09:27.434 --> 09:29.071
I'm sorry, Pastor. I...

09:29.104 --> 09:31.075
Why would you defend
a prostitute?

09:31.108 --> 09:33.079
I had to think of my son.

09:33.112 --> 09:34.749
It was his mother's funeral.

09:34.782 --> 09:36.954
He's already lost two sisters.

09:36.987 --> 09:38.657
Yes, of course.

09:38.690 --> 09:42.096
I'm sorry, Thomas.

09:44.134 --> 09:46.773
The grief of this community
weighs so heavily on me.

09:49.011 --> 09:51.249
At times,
the losses becomes a blur.

09:51.282 --> 09:54.088
Do you really believe
that we may be cursed?

09:54.121 --> 09:56.359
Only time will tell.

09:56.392 --> 09:58.898
In the meantime, we must pray

09:58.931 --> 10:01.435
God will grant us peace
in our suffering.

10:01.468 --> 10:02.972
What if prayer isn't enough?

10:03.005 --> 10:05.912
Is there something
you're withholding?

10:05.945 --> 10:07.347
You believe that, sometimes,

10:07.380 --> 10:09.118
God requires us
to take a leap of faith,

10:09.151 --> 10:11.355
- yes?
- Yes, of course.

10:14.061 --> 10:15.865
I've learned of a new ritual,

10:15.898 --> 10:17.968
one that possibly
wards off the plague.

10:20.808 --> 10:22.110
A ritual?

10:23.981 --> 10:25.985
<i>
In a town not far from here, a</i>

10:26.018 --> 10:27.989
<i>a man of faith received
a message from God</i>

10:28.022 --> 10:30.393
<i>compelling him to believe
that smallpox was caused</i>

10:30.426 --> 10:32.030
<i>by the dead rising at night</i>

10:32.063 --> 10:33.701
<i>to feast on the bodies
of the living.</i>

10:33.734 --> 10:35.972
<i>So, the townspeople
dug up the graves</i>

10:36.005 --> 10:37.441
<i>of those who had passed
from the disease,</i>

10:37.474 --> 10:40.080
and they found that their bodies
had barely decomposed,

10:40.113 --> 10:42.217
even months after their burials.

10:44.822 --> 10:45.958
They removed the hearts,

10:45.991 --> 10:47.996
<i>to prevent the possessed bodies</i>

10:48.029 --> 10:50.166
<i>from continuing their nightly
haunts, and for good measure,</i>

10:50.199 --> 10:52.104
<i>they burned them.</i>

10:52.137 --> 10:55.778
Th-This sounds like a fable,

10:55.811 --> 10:57.982
dreamt up by the desperate
and lonely.

10:58.015 --> 11:00.922
But the disease
stopped spreading.

11:00.955 --> 11:03.727
Soon, the town recovered
and life went back to normal.

11:03.760 --> 11:07.134
Are you suggesting that
we practice this savagery?

11:07.167 --> 11:09.806
I'm asking your permission
to exhume my wife's heart

11:09.839 --> 11:11.008
to save my son.

11:11.041 --> 11:13.112
I can't suffer any more loss.

11:13.145 --> 11:15.884
We could do it tonight...

11:17.220 --> 11:19.024
...before she's buried
in the morning.

11:19.057 --> 11:20.895
We will be

11:20.928 --> 11:23.333
driven out of town as heretics.

11:23.366 --> 11:26.138
Just this one corpse,
as an experiment.

11:26.171 --> 11:27.473
No one has to know.

11:41.936 --> 11:42.972
Uh...

11:44.207 --> 11:46.178
Should we say a prayer?

11:48.850 --> 11:50.888
Father, we know that Rachel

11:50.921 --> 11:53.493
is in heaven with you,

11:53.527 --> 11:56.767
and that her body
is but an empty shell.

11:56.800 --> 11:59.371
We ask that you

11:59.404 --> 12:01.108
protect us from

12:01.141 --> 12:03.146
the evil forces
that would use this shell

12:03.179 --> 12:05.383
for the devil's work,
so that we may

12:05.416 --> 12:09.291
serve you with healthy bodies
and sound minds.

12:09.324 --> 12:11.261
- Amen.
- Amen.

12:27.293 --> 12:28.830
I can't do it.

12:50.106 --> 12:51.441
This ritual...

12:52.611 --> 12:55.116
...does it cure those
who are already infected?

12:55.149 --> 12:56.351
Burning it won't.

12:58.055 --> 13:00.026
But, apparently,
eating it might.

13:02.097 --> 13:03.833
Walter.

13:04.969 --> 13:07.908
We're not eating
my wife's heart.

13:13.553 --> 13:16.425
- Absolutely not.
- Think of your son.

13:21.603 --> 13:24.174
This isn't the way
Mama used to make it.

13:24.207 --> 13:26.379
It's Daddy's new recipe. Eat up.

13:26.412 --> 13:29.184
It looks disgusting.

13:30.654 --> 13:32.859
It'll keep us healthy.

13:32.892 --> 13:36.498
You don't want to get sick like
your mother and sisters, do you?

13:39.304 --> 13:41.308
-
- We have to stay strong

13:41.341 --> 13:43.145
and keep living, for them.

13:49.124 --> 13:51.361
- Heavenly Father...
-

14:00.647 --> 14:02.618
Delilah.

14:02.651 --> 14:05.223
Sorry to bother you
at this hour, Mr. Browne.

14:05.256 --> 14:07.628
Kammi's udders were stopped up
till half past four.

14:07.661 --> 14:10.600
I barely finished milking her
before the sun went down.

14:13.005 --> 14:15.243
Oh... Your wife's funeral.

14:15.276 --> 14:16.580
I'm so sorry.

14:16.613 --> 14:18.249
- I completely forgot.
- It's all right.

14:18.282 --> 14:20.554
You're a busy woman.

14:20.587 --> 14:22.224
Perhaps my absence
was a good thing.

14:22.257 --> 14:24.495
We all know how Pastor Walter
feels about me.

14:24.529 --> 14:27.969
Is it true that you dance with
the devil under the full moon?

14:28.002 --> 14:30.140
Edward, stop it.

14:32.210 --> 14:34.448
People will always gossip
about an unmarried woman.

14:34.481 --> 14:37.287
If only you would
come to church sometime.

14:37.320 --> 14:38.489
Perhaps you could meet
someone special.

14:38.523 --> 14:39.959
Thomas, I love

14:39.992 --> 14:42.297
my life just the way
it is: happy,

14:42.330 --> 14:45.638
free, and unmarried. Besides,

14:45.671 --> 14:48.944
who needs a man when you have
the devil as your dance partner?

14:48.977 --> 14:50.681
I'll let you get back
to your evening.

14:50.714 --> 14:53.152
My condolences again.

14:54.522 --> 14:56.258
Good night, Edward.

14:56.291 --> 14:58.362
Good night, Delilah.

15:03.038 --> 15:05.276
Pastor Walter says

15:05.309 --> 15:07.548
never to trust a milkmaid.

15:07.581 --> 15:09.519
Nothing is so unclean

15:09.552 --> 15:11.222
as a woman who lives
with beasts.

15:11.255 --> 15:14.495
Edward, be kind
to those less fortunate

15:14.529 --> 15:16.198
than us.

15:16.231 --> 15:18.235
Now, have some more stew.

15:29.692 --> 15:31.261
Hi, Kammi.

15:45.791 --> 15:48.396
I'm so sorry.

15:48.429 --> 15:51.135
I didn't mean to intrude.
I was just leaving.

15:52.771 --> 15:54.642
- Oh, you're hurt.
-

15:54.675 --> 15:56.713
It's no... it's nothing.

15:56.746 --> 15:59.552
It's not nothing.
You need a doctor.

15:59.585 --> 16:01.121
Let me take you to town.

16:01.154 --> 16:02.525
No, no, no.
It's not safe for me there.

16:02.558 --> 16:04.428
- Who did this to you?
- I should...

16:04.461 --> 16:06.700
I should go
while it's still dark.

16:06.733 --> 16:08.436
No, don't be foolish.

16:08.469 --> 16:10.173
Please.

16:10.206 --> 16:12.377
My name is Delilah.

16:12.410 --> 16:13.713
You're safe here with me.

16:16.719 --> 16:19.659
Thank you, Delilah.

16:19.692 --> 16:22.297
I'm Celeste.

16:22.330 --> 16:25.403
My apologies
for the lumpy mattress.

16:25.436 --> 16:27.808
I lost everything
when my house collapsed.

16:27.841 --> 16:29.646
The founders of this town
should have never

16:29.679 --> 16:32.384
settled on shallow groundwater.

16:32.417 --> 16:34.054
Kammi's a nice
housemate, though.

16:34.087 --> 16:36.191
Kammi?

16:36.224 --> 16:38.563
My cow.

16:38.596 --> 16:40.634
It's short for Kamadhenu,

16:40.667 --> 16:43.205
the Hindu bovine goddess.

16:43.238 --> 16:44.776
Speak again?

16:44.809 --> 16:48.382
Some cultures believe that
animals should be revered

16:48.415 --> 16:50.688
and that to kill them
is an act of murder.

16:50.721 --> 16:52.390
How do you know these things?

16:52.423 --> 16:54.529
Milkmaid has plenty
of time to read.

16:54.562 --> 16:57.334
I was a milkmaid once, but, uh,

16:57.367 --> 16:59.471
- I only ever read the Bible.
- No, well,

16:59.505 --> 17:02.043
the Bible's fine,
if you like fiction.

17:03.880 --> 17:05.584
You should try this.

17:07.621 --> 17:09.190
This one's better.

17:14.300 --> 17:15.436
Don't feign outrage
on my account.

17:15.469 --> 17:18.308
There are no men
to judge us here.

17:23.419 --> 17:25.089
That'll fix her right up.

17:27.293 --> 17:28.496
You could've warned me.

17:28.530 --> 17:30.534
Whoever did this to you

17:30.567 --> 17:32.203
should be held accountable.

17:32.236 --> 17:35.511
I can think of any number of men
who might've done it.

17:35.544 --> 17:37.615
Shall I go door to door,
searching for the culprit?

17:37.648 --> 17:39.451
Please, I don't want
any trouble.

17:39.484 --> 17:40.788
He's a pow-powerful man.

17:40.821 --> 17:42.658
A man of the cloth?

17:45.363 --> 17:47.300
Pastor Walter.

17:49.204 --> 17:51.743
He threat-threatened to hang me.

17:51.776 --> 17:54.816
If I don't... leave tonight,
he'll find me

17:54.849 --> 17:56.786
- and kill me.
- Nonsense.

17:56.819 --> 17:59.458
You will stay here with me

17:59.491 --> 18:01.395
until you are completely healed,

18:01.428 --> 18:04.635
till there isn't a scratch left
on your beautiful face.

18:04.668 --> 18:07.775
That old fool won't come looking

18:07.808 --> 18:09.377
around here.

18:11.181 --> 18:14.254
Old milkmaids terrify clergymen,
didn't you know that?

18:15.957 --> 18:18.563
Because milkmaids are strong
and don't need men.

18:21.736 --> 18:24.642
If you're not a milkmaid
anymore, what is it you do?

18:27.514 --> 18:29.585
- Are you married?
- Uh...

18:31.188 --> 18:33.560
N-No. I...

18:33.593 --> 18:35.864
You really are quite beautiful.

18:40.306 --> 18:41.710
I'm...

18:41.743 --> 18:44.381
I'm quite tired.

18:44.414 --> 18:45.784
May I sleep?

18:47.286 --> 18:48.422
Of course.

19:08.963 --> 19:11.702
<i>
It's all right if you can't cry.</i>

19:13.338 --> 19:15.978
You know, when Faith died,

19:16.011 --> 19:18.416
I couldn't stop crying.

19:18.449 --> 19:20.587
It felt like the pain
would never end.

19:22.825 --> 19:24.729
Then, when Annabelle died,

19:24.762 --> 19:27.367
tears didn't come as easily,

19:27.400 --> 19:29.672
not because
I loved her any less,

19:29.705 --> 19:32.577
because I was used
to living with loss.

19:34.548 --> 19:36.251
And then when
your mother passed...

19:37.588 --> 19:40.492
...the grief transformed
into something else entirely.

19:41.662 --> 19:43.667
A heaviness that
doesn't allow for tears.

19:43.700 --> 19:45.838
But...

19:45.871 --> 19:47.608
if we don't cry, then

19:47.641 --> 19:50.346
how will they know
that we loved them?

19:50.379 --> 19:53.252
They know you love them.

19:53.285 --> 19:56.024
They don't need your tears
to prove anything.

19:56.057 --> 19:59.431
What beautiful flowers, Edward.

19:59.464 --> 20:00.834
Did you pick them yourself?

20:05.409 --> 20:08.249
The Lord restoreth all wounds

20:08.282 --> 20:09.985
to those who believe.

20:11.923 --> 20:13.560
Even wounds

20:13.593 --> 20:15.496
of the heart.

20:16.632 --> 20:18.603
How's your health, Thomas?

20:18.636 --> 20:20.272
Blessed. And yours?

20:23.078 --> 20:25.550
I've never felt so alive.

20:29.959 --> 20:32.598
It's a pleasure
to see you, Walter.

20:32.631 --> 20:34.669
We've got to be on our way.

20:34.702 --> 20:36.773
You haven't been to church
in some time.

20:36.806 --> 20:39.512
Not since the night
of Rachel's funeral.

20:39.545 --> 20:42.517
Did he not feast
on our special communion?

20:44.020 --> 20:46.491
Edward, go home.

20:53.773 --> 20:57.515
Yes, I fed my son
his mother's heart,

20:57.548 --> 20:59.451
and I haven't been able
to sleep at night since.

20:59.484 --> 21:03.058
It was a horrible mistake
that we made,

21:03.091 --> 21:05.898
brought on by
the hysteria of grief.

21:05.931 --> 21:09.037
I am sorry I convinced you
to commit such

21:09.070 --> 21:11.509
- a horrendous act.
- Oh, I am not sorry at all.

21:11.542 --> 21:13.914
Ever since that night,
I have been

21:13.947 --> 21:16.853
spared from
the slightest sniffle.

21:16.886 --> 21:19.825
Not a blemish has appeared
on my body.

21:19.858 --> 21:22.330
The sick and
the suffering, they...

21:22.363 --> 21:24.769
claw at me,
desperate for my prayers,

21:24.802 --> 21:28.442
and yet, I remain well.

21:28.475 --> 21:30.613
The ritual worked.

21:32.751 --> 21:35.022
There is nothing godly
about cannibalism.

21:42.871 --> 21:45.643
I've gotten quite good
at the explantation.

21:46.846 --> 21:49.685
Poor Edgar Brukner

21:49.718 --> 21:52.357
died all alone,

21:52.390 --> 21:54.895
with no one
to watch over his corpse.

22:05.750 --> 22:08.122
The Lord has rewarded us
for taking

22:08.155 --> 22:10.126
a leap of faith,

22:10.159 --> 22:11.896
just as you said he would.

22:13.198 --> 22:15.737
But people are going
to start questioning

22:15.770 --> 22:17.072
why we are immune
to this plague.

22:18.475 --> 22:19.978
We have got to tell
the people the truth.

22:21.582 --> 22:24.655
That God has revealed
to us the cure.

23:03.966 --> 23:06.506
Oh, Celeste.

23:06.539 --> 23:08.142
You have smallpox.

23:10.079 --> 23:11.616
No, I don't.

23:11.649 --> 23:13.152
Your corset's going
to make it worse.

23:13.185 --> 23:15.557
I need to wear it
to keep my wounds alive.

23:15.590 --> 23:18.797
God's anger is agitating them
because they've gone too long

23:18.830 --> 23:20.600
- without being milked.
- We have to isolate you.

23:21.802 --> 23:24.542
I'm not sick, I promise you.

23:24.575 --> 23:26.478
In fact,

23:26.512 --> 23:28.683
I'm a healer.

23:28.716 --> 23:30.787
I've been anointed

23:30.820 --> 23:32.691
by Saint Lazarus.

23:32.724 --> 23:34.929
You must be burning up. Please,
let me get your fever down.

23:34.962 --> 23:38.102
Please, let me explain.
You have been

23:38.135 --> 23:41.074
so kind to me, watching over me

23:41.107 --> 23:43.813
all this time. I owe it to you

23:43.846 --> 23:46.652
to tell you the truth
about who I really am.

23:55.302 --> 23:58.075
These boils appeared on my body
during my time as a milkmaid,

23:58.108 --> 24:01.783
but... I never once got sick.

24:01.816 --> 24:05.924
I hid them
by wearing this corset.

24:05.957 --> 24:07.594
No one ever knew about them

24:07.627 --> 24:10.801
until I fell in love

24:10.834 --> 24:12.538
with a wonderful man.

24:12.571 --> 24:15.944
I soon became pregnant

24:15.977 --> 24:17.748
and grew too round

24:17.781 --> 24:19.718
to keep my secret from him.

24:21.121 --> 24:23.860
When he finally saw the boils,

24:23.893 --> 24:26.031
he couldn't look at me again...

24:26.064 --> 24:28.670
...let alone touch me.

24:28.703 --> 24:30.139
I gave birth.

24:30.172 --> 24:32.945
He left me

24:32.978 --> 24:35.817
and took our child with him.

24:38.756 --> 24:41.962
I was cast out from society.

24:44.668 --> 24:46.972
With no other way to survive...

24:48.743 --> 24:50.146
...I sold my sex.

24:55.022 --> 24:57.293
<i>
I tried to keep my wounds hidden</i>

24:57.326 --> 24:59.598
<i>from my patrons,</i>

24:59.631 --> 25:02.270
<i>but then I was surprised
to learn</i>

25:02.303 --> 25:05.543
<i>how easily men turn their fears
into a fetish.</i>

25:06.912 --> 25:08.583
<i>They lined up,</i>

25:08.616 --> 25:11.722
<i>one after the other
to tempt their fate.</i>

25:11.755 --> 25:14.260
But then, something
miraculous happened.

25:14.293 --> 25:16.866
<i>I began to notice</i>

25:16.899 --> 25:18.937
<i>that the men who feasted upon me</i>

25:18.970 --> 25:21.007
<i>never got sick,</i>

25:21.040 --> 25:23.278
<i>even though everyone around them</i>

25:23.311 --> 25:25.617
<i>seemed to fade away and die.</i>

25:25.650 --> 25:28.690
<i>God had chosen me</i>

25:28.723 --> 25:31.995
<i>to heal the sick and suffering.</i>

25:33.198 --> 25:36.071
Just as Jesus raised Lazarus
from the dead

25:36.104 --> 25:37.875
to remind the world

25:37.908 --> 25:40.781
that love can save us
from anything,

25:40.814 --> 25:42.785
I knew

25:42.818 --> 25:45.924
that God had put me
on this earth to heal

25:45.957 --> 25:48.863
people with love.

25:52.069 --> 25:54.775
But love doesn't heal, Celeste.

25:54.808 --> 25:56.344
Only science can do that.

25:56.377 --> 25:59.184
But science
is a gift from God,

25:59.217 --> 26:00.720
and God is love.

26:00.753 --> 26:02.925
These things don't matter now.

26:02.958 --> 26:06.198
If these men were
truly protected from smallpox

26:06.231 --> 26:08.001
because of your boils,

26:08.034 --> 26:09.939
we have to find out
what's inside them

26:09.972 --> 26:11.642
that's preventing people
from getting sick,

26:11.675 --> 26:13.913
so we can isolate it
and reproduce it.

26:13.946 --> 26:17.186
Celeste, we can save
so many people.

26:17.219 --> 26:19.658
Divinity cannot be reproduced.

26:19.691 --> 26:21.662
It can only be appreciated.

26:21.695 --> 26:24.400
I admire your ability
to believe,

26:24.433 --> 26:27.206
but I have to get
to the bottom of this.

26:34.755 --> 26:37.828
Recently, I learned
of a nearby village.

26:37.861 --> 26:41.101
Now, I hesitate to tell you
the desperate ordeal

26:41.134 --> 26:42.738
this community went through.

26:42.771 --> 26:45.041
It is not
for the faint of heart.

26:46.712 --> 26:48.415
Delirious with grief,

26:48.448 --> 26:50.820
the townspeople began to believe

26:50.853 --> 26:52.691
that smallpox was caused

26:52.724 --> 26:55.262
by the dead

26:55.295 --> 26:58.836
rising at night
to feast on the living.

26:58.869 --> 27:02.276
So, they exhumed
the bodies and found

27:02.309 --> 27:05.182
that the corpses
had not even begun

27:05.215 --> 27:06.451
to decompose.

27:06.484 --> 27:09.324
To prevent the possessed bodies

27:09.357 --> 27:10.894
from their evil plight,

27:10.927 --> 27:13.265
the townspeople
removed their hearts

27:13.298 --> 27:14.902
and ate them.

27:17.439 --> 27:18.877
I know.

27:18.910 --> 27:22.316
I know it is shocking,

27:22.349 --> 27:26.057
but the town began to recover.

27:26.090 --> 27:29.330
Now, I was horrified
when I learned of this-this...

27:29.363 --> 27:31.201
this barbarism.

27:31.234 --> 27:35.042
It seems so...

27:35.075 --> 27:37.413
un-Christian.

27:37.446 --> 27:39.985
- And, yet...
- It worked.

27:41.254 --> 27:43.292
Indeed.
Give me a shovel,

27:43.325 --> 27:44.895
and I'll be the first to dig.

27:44.928 --> 27:46.197
Anything to put an end
to our suffering.

27:46.230 --> 27:47.768
No, no, no.

27:47.801 --> 27:50.740
We must not let our grief
hasten our actions.

27:50.773 --> 27:51.875
What have we got to lose?

28:03.933 --> 28:07.173
Why are you so set on proving
that I'm not a healer?

28:07.206 --> 28:09.243
Why can't...

28:09.276 --> 28:11.314
why...

28:11.347 --> 28:13.451
can't I be special to you?

28:21.902 --> 28:23.806
You are special to me.

28:23.839 --> 28:26.444
Just because there's a
logical answer to your healing

28:26.477 --> 28:28.215
doesn't mean you haven't
helped people.

28:28.248 --> 28:30.486
But why is it so hard for you
to believe in God?

28:30.520 --> 28:32.991
God is simply the unknown.

28:33.024 --> 28:36.131
In time, scientists will uncover
the truth of everything.

28:36.164 --> 28:38.902
Where will God be then?

28:41.975 --> 28:43.980
Have you ever considered
your faith

28:44.013 --> 28:46.084
is just a distraction
from your wounded heart?

28:46.117 --> 28:47.821
How dare you.

28:47.854 --> 28:50.225
You're the one who's constantly

28:50.258 --> 28:52.564
escaping into your books.

28:52.597 --> 28:54.233
What are you running from?

28:55.837 --> 28:57.840
My love for you, perhaps?

28:59.911 --> 29:02.350
You can't deny a bond
has grown between us.

29:02.383 --> 29:04.855
Uh, I...

29:04.888 --> 29:07.360
I l-- I love you, too, Delilah,

29:07.393 --> 29:09.798
but as I love
all children of God.

29:16.210 --> 29:19.384
If you are truly a healer,

29:19.417 --> 29:21.955
then I want to be healed.

29:24.226 --> 29:27.834
Let me taste
the divinity for myself.

30:09.584 --> 30:11.588
Have you ever been infected?

30:13.526 --> 30:17.634
I had a mild outbreak of boils
when I was young,

30:17.667 --> 30:19.905
but I recovered swiftly.

30:19.938 --> 30:22.176
Your life was spared.

30:22.209 --> 30:24.146
Why do you think that is?

30:26.652 --> 30:28.455
I eat well.

30:28.488 --> 30:30.527
I live in nature.

30:30.560 --> 30:33.666
I isolate from the gravely ill.

30:33.699 --> 30:37.206
You deliver Kammi's milk
to sick people every day.

30:37.239 --> 30:38.576
Of course, but...

30:38.609 --> 30:40.580
Maybe...

30:40.613 --> 30:44.053
you've been blessed,
just like me.

30:44.086 --> 30:47.259
Hmm? How do you explain
that some people get sick

30:47.292 --> 30:48.929
while others don't?

30:50.499 --> 30:53.639
Surely God has a hand
in deciding our fate.

30:55.643 --> 30:58.247
If that's true,
then God is cruel.

31:01.254 --> 31:04.160
Damn it. Are Kammi's udders
bleeding again?

31:04.193 --> 31:07.099
Yes, but nothing too bad.

31:07.132 --> 31:09.203
This batch is no good.

31:09.236 --> 31:13.011
A little blood
won't spoil the milk.

31:13.044 --> 31:15.215
This milk could spread cowpox.

31:15.248 --> 31:17.153
That's ridiculous.

31:17.186 --> 31:19.490
Scientists now believe
there are small creatures,

31:19.524 --> 31:21.161
invisible to the naked eye,

31:21.194 --> 31:23.197
that can spread illness
through bodily fluids.

31:24.534 --> 31:26.304
Mm...

31:26.337 --> 31:30.078
That didn't seem to worry you
a few moments ago.

31:33.218 --> 31:36.324
Delilah, I told you,

31:36.357 --> 31:39.463
no one has ever gotten sick
from sleeping with me.

31:39.496 --> 31:42.235
Scientists are wrong
all the time.

31:43.404 --> 31:45.509
But what if they're
right about this?

31:47.747 --> 31:51.321
Kammi's boils look exactly
like the ones on your body,

31:51.354 --> 31:53.659
and the same as mine did,
all those years ago.

31:53.692 --> 31:55.094
So?

31:57.366 --> 31:59.070
See?

31:59.103 --> 32:01.174
They're perfectly round.

32:01.207 --> 32:04.347
Human smallpox
doesn't look like this.

32:04.380 --> 32:06.451
They have a more
chaotic pattern,

32:06.484 --> 32:09.290
like fungus growth.

32:09.323 --> 32:13.064
What if you and I got cowpox
from being milkmaids?

32:13.097 --> 32:16.004
We're not cows.

32:16.037 --> 32:18.408
If cowpox spread through
their infected udders,

32:18.441 --> 32:21.047
that means anyone that came
in contact with our boils

32:21.080 --> 32:22.684
was also infected with cowpox.

32:22.717 --> 32:24.487
You're not listening to me.

32:24.521 --> 32:28.161
Every man who came to me
didn't get sick.

32:28.194 --> 32:31.367
- I healed them.
- That's exactly it.

32:31.400 --> 32:33.506
Cowpox doesn't make humans sick

32:33.539 --> 32:35.475
in the same way
that smallpox does.

32:35.509 --> 32:39.250
If these men were protected in
the way that you say they were,

32:39.283 --> 32:41.321
it's quite possible that cowpox

32:41.354 --> 32:43.559
provides an immunity
to smallpox.

32:45.095 --> 32:48.268
This contaminated milk

32:48.301 --> 32:50.506
could be the key.

32:50.539 --> 32:53.311
You stay here
and keep milking Kammi

32:53.344 --> 32:55.717
for as long as her udders
are bleeding.

32:55.750 --> 32:59.123
I'm going to deliver
these bottles,

32:59.156 --> 33:01.695
and then I'll come back
for more.

33:03.699 --> 33:05.435
Celeste...

33:06.705 --> 33:10.647
...we're going to save
the world from smallpox.

33:10.680 --> 33:12.482
Mm.

33:40.205 --> 33:42.510
What say you of this, Lazarus?

33:43.679 --> 33:45.616
Was I never a healer?

33:47.887 --> 33:50.793
Were you ever healed,

33:50.826 --> 33:53.097
or were you faking it, too?

34:06.692 --> 34:10.499
we unite here to overcome
the forces of evil

34:10.533 --> 34:13.506
that have plagued our community
for far too long.

34:13.539 --> 34:15.810
Some may be hesitant

34:15.843 --> 34:18.415
to uncover the bodies
of their loved ones,

34:18.448 --> 34:19.685
but I assure you,

34:19.718 --> 34:22.189
we will bury them properly

34:22.222 --> 34:25.162
after every last vestige
of evil

34:25.195 --> 34:27.867
has been removed.

34:27.900 --> 34:29.771
They will know peace.

34:31.541 --> 34:34.313
In the name of Christ,

34:34.346 --> 34:36.819
let the healing begin!

34:42.864 --> 34:45.435
Thomas? Edward? Open the door.

34:45.468 --> 34:47.272
I have a very urgent delivery.

34:52.215 --> 34:53.686
Father's not home.

34:53.719 --> 34:55.690
It seems like no one is home.
Where is everyone?

34:55.723 --> 34:57.594
At the cemetery.

34:57.627 --> 34:59.631
Pastor Walter found the cure
for smallpox.

34:59.664 --> 35:02.436
- What?
- Something about digging up the dead

35:02.469 --> 35:05.142
- to stop them from killing us.
- You're playing a joke on me.

35:05.175 --> 35:08.181
Father left here an hour ago
with a shovel in his hand.

35:08.214 --> 35:10.720
That's the most absurd thing
I have ever heard.

35:10.753 --> 35:13.191
Are you sure you heard right?

35:13.224 --> 35:15.630
Edward,

35:15.663 --> 35:17.734
I need you to listen to me.

35:17.767 --> 35:19.470
This is no ordinary milk.

35:19.504 --> 35:22.476
This milk will save you
from getting sick.

35:22.510 --> 35:25.616
I don't care if I get sick.
I'm strong.

35:25.649 --> 35:27.721
But you will spread
the disease to others

35:27.754 --> 35:29.256
who might not be strong.

35:29.289 --> 35:31.628
If they are weak,
then they should die.

35:31.661 --> 35:34.366
Pastor Walter says
it's the natural order.

35:34.399 --> 35:36.505
He's gonna save us all
from this plague.

35:36.538 --> 35:38.375
We don't need your milk.

35:38.408 --> 35:41.313
Drink the goddamn milk.

35:57.245 --> 35:59.885
Everyone, stop, please.

35:59.918 --> 36:01.387
Stop this madness.

36:01.420 --> 36:03.291
You're going to make
yourselves sick.

36:03.324 --> 36:04.961
I have the real cure,

36:04.994 --> 36:06.765
- and it's in this milk.
Delilah.

36:06.798 --> 36:09.370
Delilah, you shouldn't be here.

36:09.403 --> 36:11.508
What is happening?
This is insanity.

36:11.541 --> 36:13.378
Something evil is going on.

36:13.411 --> 36:15.550
The bodies aren't decomposing.

36:15.583 --> 36:19.256
It's not evil. This town was
built on shallow groundwater.

36:19.289 --> 36:21.260
The salt in the soil,

36:21.293 --> 36:22.964
it slows
the decomposition process.

36:22.997 --> 36:24.668
What is this hysterical

36:24.701 --> 36:26.270
woman going on about?

36:26.303 --> 36:28.909
Walter, she may have a point.

36:28.942 --> 36:31.280
How many times have I told you?
Never trust a milkmaid.

36:31.313 --> 36:33.686
The Bible teaches us
that the devil

36:33.719 --> 36:37.259
employs unclean spirits
to do his bidding.

36:37.292 --> 36:39.564
You must stop this barbarity.

36:39.597 --> 36:41.969
The real antidote to smallpox
is in this milk.

36:42.002 --> 36:43.939
I have enough
for several families,

36:43.972 --> 36:46.512
and Celeste is preparing more
as we speak.

36:46.545 --> 36:48.916
Soon, we'll be able
to inoculate the whole town.

36:48.949 --> 36:50.520
Celeste?

36:50.553 --> 36:52.957
- Is she okay?
- She's wonderful.

36:52.990 --> 36:54.828
Oh, there is nothing wonderful

36:54.861 --> 36:56.664
about that filthy whore.

37:02.877 --> 37:05.950
I know what you did to her.

37:05.983 --> 37:08.689
She's the reason you're healthy.

37:08.722 --> 37:11.562
The cure in her boils
is the same cure

37:11.595 --> 37:13.732
that's in this milk.

37:13.765 --> 37:16.672
Every healthy man
that's alive in this town

37:16.705 --> 37:18.676
is alive because of Celeste.

37:18.709 --> 37:22.316
We are alive because God
spares the righteous.

37:22.349 --> 37:23.986
Walter, you must listen to me.

37:24.019 --> 37:26.558
You must stop this madness.

37:26.591 --> 37:27.694
Fine.

37:27.727 --> 37:29.764
I will.

37:33.639 --> 37:35.976
If only Adam had struck Eve...

37:37.513 --> 37:39.717
...we'd still be
in the Garden of Eden.

37:41.387 --> 37:43.391
Come, Thomas.

37:43.424 --> 37:45.061
Let's take care of...

37:45.094 --> 37:46.898
the other one.

37:52.375 --> 37:55.048
Celeste is harmless, Walter.

37:55.081 --> 37:56.752
Please, leave her alone.

37:56.785 --> 37:59.858
Why are you defending
these godless women?

37:59.891 --> 38:01.795
If we allow them
to trample over us,

38:01.828 --> 38:03.632
the world will unravel

38:03.665 --> 38:05.736
and society itself
will collapse.

38:07.840 --> 38:10.011
Because Celeste
is Edward's real mother.

38:12.950 --> 38:16.390
I made the worst mistake
in my life when I left her.

38:16.423 --> 38:19.029
It's because of me that
she turned to a life of sin.

38:20.566 --> 38:23.037
Do I even know the man

38:23.070 --> 38:24.907
that stands before me?

38:26.678 --> 38:29.784
Your weakness is repulsive.

38:29.817 --> 38:32.089
Now, move.

38:32.122 --> 38:33.525
Move.

39:12.469 --> 39:14.440
Love, are you finished
with the deliveries already?

39:14.473 --> 39:16.578
The new batch is ready.

39:19.149 --> 39:20.819
Love?

39:24.459 --> 39:25.996
Where is Delilah?

39:27.933 --> 39:29.704
What did you do?

39:29.737 --> 39:33.478
Blessed are they that
follow my commandments,

39:33.512 --> 39:36.985
but cursed are the sorcerers,

39:37.018 --> 39:40.626
the whores, and the idolaters.

39:40.659 --> 39:42.162
- They shall be put to death.
- Please.

39:42.195 --> 39:45.001
I've only ever wanted
to help this community,

39:45.034 --> 39:46.872
as you claim to do.

39:49.510 --> 39:51.648
You think I believe my own lies?

39:51.681 --> 39:54.887
There is no such thing
as selflessness.

39:57.192 --> 40:00.800
Humility is but a mask we wear

40:00.833 --> 40:03.939
to hide our hunger for power.

40:05.174 --> 40:07.981
We perceive the world
as we create it.

40:08.014 --> 40:09.851
I didn't realize whores
could be so...

40:09.884 --> 40:11.655
highbrow.

40:11.688 --> 40:13.726
Don't come any closer.

40:13.759 --> 40:15.896
I've thought a lot about that
afternoon we spent together.

40:15.929 --> 40:17.767
-
- I have to admit,

40:17.800 --> 40:20.171
it wasn't so bad...

40:20.204 --> 40:22.175
once I got over the smell
of your rotting

40:22.208 --> 40:24.046
- flesh.
-

40:26.785 --> 40:29.055
Maybe we can have
one more go around...

40:31.060 --> 40:33.799
...before I do you in
once and for all.

40:33.832 --> 40:35.536
No! No!

40:35.569 --> 40:37.873
- Let me go!

41:00.753 --> 41:02.122
Are you all right?

41:02.155 --> 41:04.828
Yes. Thank God you're here.

41:04.861 --> 41:07.700
Celeste?

41:07.733 --> 41:09.938
Thomas?

41:09.971 --> 41:12.075
Thomas,
you're bleeding terribly.

41:12.108 --> 41:14.714
Don't... touch me,

41:14.747 --> 41:16.852
you wicked woman.

41:16.885 --> 41:18.789
Thomas, please, let me help you.

41:18.822 --> 41:19.858
I trusted you

41:19.891 --> 41:22.129
as a friend.

41:22.162 --> 41:23.699
Everyone warned me

41:23.732 --> 41:25.201
of your unnatural ways.

41:25.234 --> 41:26.705
What are you saying?

41:26.738 --> 41:29.075
Did you do this to her?

41:31.781 --> 41:34.019
Did she corrupt you to lust

41:34.052 --> 41:35.756
as unnaturally as she does?

41:35.789 --> 41:38.027
She didn't do anything

41:38.060 --> 41:41.167
but help me
when I needed it most.

41:41.200 --> 41:44.106
For all these years,
I blamed myself.

41:44.139 --> 41:46.243
I thought I condemned you
to a life

41:46.276 --> 41:48.247
of degradation and sin.

41:49.750 --> 41:51.955
But now I see
the seed of wickedness

41:51.988 --> 41:53.291
was within you all along.

41:53.324 --> 41:56.898
You ruin everything you touch.

41:56.931 --> 41:59.269
You've destroyed my life,

41:59.302 --> 42:00.973
and now you're tearing
this town apart.

42:01.006 --> 42:03.144
Thomas, your wounds

42:03.177 --> 42:05.014
make you speak in haste.
You don't know

42:05.047 --> 42:07.119
- what you're saying.
-

42:07.152 --> 42:09.056
Oh, dear God.

42:09.089 --> 42:10.692
Poor Edward.

42:12.963 --> 42:14.900
Edward?

42:18.642 --> 42:22.149
There is something
terribly wrong with that boy.

42:22.182 --> 42:24.286
I've tried.

42:24.319 --> 42:28.127
I've tried everything I can
to get him on the right path.

42:30.198 --> 42:33.906
I even married a woman
who mothered him as her own son,

42:33.939 --> 42:36.043
but deep down,

42:36.076 --> 42:37.747
he never loved her.

42:37.780 --> 42:39.884
He's never loved a single soul.

42:45.361 --> 42:48.100
Because he inherited
this wickedness

42:48.133 --> 42:50.071
from you.

42:50.104 --> 42:52.175
No.

42:52.208 --> 42:54.681
If I know one thing about
Celeste, it's that she's capable

42:54.714 --> 42:56.885
of nothing but love.

42:56.918 --> 42:59.657
Your love is a curse
that must be stopped.

43:06.671 --> 43:08.207
No.

43:08.240 --> 43:10.645
CELESTE
No, no...

43:11.814 --> 43:13.818
You monster!

43:23.103 --> 43:24.674
No...

43:24.707 --> 43:26.343
No.

43:26.376 --> 43:28.046
Celeste...

43:30.384 --> 43:32.222
You must take

43:32.255 --> 43:34.994
the discovery of our inoculation

43:35.027 --> 43:36.965
and deliver it...

43:36.998 --> 43:40.205
No, don't talk like this.

43:40.238 --> 43:42.977
I can't live without you,
Delilah. Please...

43:43.010 --> 43:46.250
You must tell everyone

43:46.283 --> 43:49.089
about our cure.

43:55.936 --> 43:59.276
No, no, no, no...

44:56.524 --> 44:57.827
Edward.

44:57.860 --> 44:59.462
Who are you?

45:02.335 --> 45:05.208
I'm your real mother.

45:05.241 --> 45:08.013
My name is Celeste.

45:10.451 --> 45:12.923
You're going to have
to come with me.

45:12.956 --> 45:14.794
Where is my father?

45:14.827 --> 45:16.430
Edward...

45:16.463 --> 45:18.234
I'm very sorry.

45:18.267 --> 45:21.440
Your father is dead.

45:21.473 --> 45:23.745
Everybody dies.

45:24.880 --> 45:26.416
No.

45:30.224 --> 45:33.364
Do you see that cow
outside?

45:33.397 --> 45:36.070
Her name is Kammi,

45:36.103 --> 45:39.777
and she's the key to
a healthy future for us all.

45:41.948 --> 45:43.952
I'm going to make sure

45:43.985 --> 45:46.189
that you don't get sick.

45:47.392 --> 45:49.897
Please, Edward.

45:53.037 --> 45:55.341
I need you to trust me.

46:02.422 --> 46:06.230
Everything's going to be
all right, son.

46:06.263 --> 46:08.969
Soon, we'll spread the good news

46:09.002 --> 46:10.506
of a brighter future.

46:10.539 --> 46:14.312
We'll save
so many lives together.

46:16.249 --> 46:18.020

46:18.053 --> 46:20.190

46:22.028 --> 46:24.433

once again, aren't I?

46:31.179 --> 46:32.883

46:50.451 --> 46:53.891
Nothing is so unclean as
a woman who lives with beasts.
