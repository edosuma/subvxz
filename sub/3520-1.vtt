WEBVTT

00:15.767 --> 00:17.352
Look at the sun
coming through the trees.

00:17.560 --> 00:19.104
I know.
It's so beautiful.

00:22.148 --> 00:25.568
There's actually a tree around here
that's over 1,400 years old.

00:25.735 --> 00:28.196
- We have to go see that one.
- Go see a tree?

00:28.363 --> 00:30.573
- I don't think so, Paddy.
- Don't be such a grouch.

00:30.740 --> 00:32.659
It'll be fun, I promise.
And educational.

00:32.826 --> 00:34.744
You know what else would
be fun and educational?

00:34.911 --> 00:36.871
Going to the clothing-optional pool
at the Highlands.

00:37.038 --> 00:38.998
Ugh. There are not enough
antibiotics in the world

00:39.165 --> 00:40.208
to get me in that water.

00:40.375 --> 00:42.419
You're not scared of a little
gonorrhea, are you, Dom?

00:42.585 --> 00:44.379
I'm doing whatever he tells me.

00:44.546 --> 00:46.548
And if that's seeing some old tree,
I'm in, Paddy.

00:46.715 --> 00:48.425
Well, thank you, Dom.

00:48.591 --> 00:51.010
I really think that this weekend
should be about the three of us

00:51.177 --> 00:52.637
hanging out together.

00:52.804 --> 00:55.557
Not us and 200 naked homos
crammed in a pool.

01:01.938 --> 01:06.067
Oh, my God.

01:06.234 --> 01:07.694
Oh, my God.

01:07.902 --> 01:09.195
Get me out
of this fucking thing.

01:09.362 --> 01:11.114
Look at this.

01:11.239 --> 01:13.324
Oh, my God, Dom!

01:13.491 --> 01:15.410
This place is
fucking amazing!

01:15.577 --> 01:17.245
All right. Honestly, it's better
than I thought it was.

01:17.412 --> 01:18.747
- I mean, wow. That's cool.
- Wow.

01:18.913 --> 01:20.165
Who knew Lynn
was so rich?

01:20.331 --> 01:21.666
It's also Lynn's pride and joy,

01:21.833 --> 01:23.460
- so no breaking stuff.
- Okay.

01:23.626 --> 01:25.712
I gotta get myself
a sugar daddy.

01:25.879 --> 01:28.548
For that,
you get the bunk-bed room.

01:28.715 --> 01:30.508
I guess I'm unpacking the car?

01:34.679 --> 01:36.431
Of course I won't forget.

01:38.558 --> 01:39.601
Yeah.

01:41.311 --> 01:42.854
No, no, I totally get it.

01:43.021 --> 01:44.647
Yeah, windows locked.

01:44.814 --> 01:46.524
Is that completely amazing
or totally hideous?

01:46.691 --> 01:48.401
I think it's both, actually.

01:48.568 --> 01:49.778
Why is the hair so curly?

01:49.944 --> 01:51.321
Well, what's up with the owl
flying in the back?

01:51.488 --> 01:52.947
I know.
Maybe just don't bring it up.

01:53.114 --> 01:54.949
And no more sugar-daddy stuff
either, okay?

01:57.368 --> 01:59.788
Here we go.
Oh, my goodness.

01:59.954 --> 02:01.080
- What is this?
- Oh, yes.

02:01.247 --> 02:03.041
- Is it a sprig of mint I see?
- Wow.

02:03.208 --> 02:04.626
It is. I found
a bush in the back.

02:04.793 --> 02:06.795
Oh, my God,
you're incredible.

02:06.961 --> 02:09.005
See, this is it.
This is exactly what we need.

02:09.130 --> 02:11.299
Fresh mint, peace, tranquility,

02:11.466 --> 02:13.885
nature's majesty
just all around us.

02:14.052 --> 02:15.303
- Right? Cheers.
- Yeah, cheers.

02:15.470 --> 02:16.763
How about a little vodka, huh?

02:16.888 --> 02:17.972
Shouldn't we raid
the liquor cabinet?

02:18.139 --> 02:19.474
Don't even think about it.

02:20.099 --> 02:21.810
Yeah, I think maybe, uh...

02:21.893 --> 02:23.186
I'll do it now.

02:23.311 --> 02:24.729
...I think maybe we should not

02:24.813 --> 02:26.940
get completely wasted
this weekend.

02:27.106 --> 02:28.650
I think maybe
we should make a pact,

02:28.817 --> 02:29.943
right here and now,

02:30.109 --> 02:33.071
that we should just
all not drink or...

02:34.072 --> 02:35.824
- What?
- Please, God,

02:35.990 --> 02:37.826
don't tell me this is some kind
of inter-fucking-vention.

02:37.992 --> 02:40.203
No, it's not an intervention.
Right, Dom?

02:40.328 --> 02:42.413
- Dom, right?
- Dom?

02:42.580 --> 02:43.873
You know, I actually
prefer you fucked up,

02:44.040 --> 02:45.750
because it makes you
way less narcissistic.

02:45.917 --> 02:47.460
But Patrick insisted that
we bring you out into nature.

02:47.627 --> 02:50.088
- I did not insist on anything.
- The two of you

02:50.213 --> 02:52.382
have been plotting and planning
like a couple of old witches.

02:52.549 --> 02:54.509
No, we have not. That's not--
That's not what it is.

02:54.676 --> 02:56.135
It's not what you think.
I just feel like--

02:56.302 --> 02:57.470
That's not what it is.
It really isn't.

02:57.595 --> 02:59.764
Maybe just, like, let--
Maybe just not be drinking.

02:59.848 --> 03:02.350
Well, I-- I want you to know
that I'm completely fine.

03:02.517 --> 03:03.726
- Okay?
- Okay.

03:03.893 --> 03:06.396
Just 'cause I choose not to wallow
in the misery of my own making...

03:06.563 --> 03:07.689
- Oh.
- I don't wallow.

03:07.856 --> 03:09.941
"Oh, my God, what should I do
with Richie? Should I call Richie?

03:10.108 --> 03:11.568
Should I text Richie?
Should I Instagram Richie?

03:11.734 --> 03:13.027
Oh, my God,
he's just so cute."

03:13.152 --> 03:14.946
That sounds nothing like me. Dom,
does that sound anything like me?

03:15.071 --> 03:16.614
Your voice is a little higher,
but it's pretty good.

03:16.781 --> 03:19.284
You do know that getting drunk and
slapping some cock around your face

03:19.450 --> 03:20.869
isn't actually
the worst thing in the world.

03:21.035 --> 03:22.954
Okay, I'm sorry I'm not you
and I don't find it attractive

03:23.121 --> 03:25.206
to get completely fucked up and drag
some random person home,

03:25.373 --> 03:27.542
and then fuck him so loudly
that I have to wear earplugs.

03:27.709 --> 03:29.168
- It was just one time, okay?
- I can't even sleep.

03:29.335 --> 03:31.629
- I can hear you through the walls.
- Ladies, ladies, please.

03:31.796 --> 03:33.256
If we can't play nice,
we're going home.

03:33.339 --> 03:36.801
No, you're right, Dom.
Let's just relax, breathe.

03:37.594 --> 03:39.387
I genuinely brought us here
'cause I thought

03:39.554 --> 03:40.972
it would be good
for the three of us to get away.

03:41.139 --> 03:42.765
- This is not an intervention.
- Mm-hmm.

03:43.308 --> 03:45.977
Honestly, I need this weekend,
even if you don't.

03:46.144 --> 03:48.730
- Why do you need it?
- I just do.

03:52.317 --> 03:54.527
Gee, I didn't see
that there was cherries.

03:54.736 --> 03:56.195
- Do you want a cherry?
- Sure.

03:56.362 --> 03:58.823
Cherry?
Let's just enjoy the cherries

03:58.990 --> 04:01.993
and the minty tea that Dom
has so kindly made for us,

04:02.160 --> 04:04.913
and, you know, take in
this beautiful view.

04:11.836 --> 04:15.340
So, actually, when
the Native Americans came through

04:15.506 --> 04:18.509
this area of the woods,
they didn't spend any time here,

04:18.676 --> 04:20.803
and they left
because they were afraid

04:20.970 --> 04:25.350
that the trees were so tall
that there was ghosts in them.

04:25.516 --> 04:28.269
Over 1,000 years
and it's just stood there,

04:28.436 --> 04:30.146
knowing exactly
what its purpose was...

04:30.313 --> 04:33.608
...to stand and grow
and look good while doing it.

04:34.525 --> 04:36.527
This would be a great tree
to get fucked against.

04:36.694 --> 04:38.196
Oh, my God, why do you
always do that?

04:38.363 --> 04:39.948
There's more to life
than sex, you know.

04:40.365 --> 04:41.783
Sorry.

04:48.706 --> 04:49.958
Now what?

04:50.959 --> 04:52.293
Hike back again?

05:07.767 --> 05:09.811
Hey.
What are you up to?

05:11.145 --> 05:14.983
Well, I was trying to be respectful
of Lynn's privacy,

05:15.149 --> 05:16.943
but then I found
a photo album,

05:17.110 --> 05:18.820
- so fuck it.
- Oh, shit.

05:19.737 --> 05:22.573
I think I only agreed to this
so I could snoop around this place

05:22.740 --> 05:24.826
- without him here.
- What are you looking for?

05:25.535 --> 05:27.996
I don't know.
Something that helps me

05:28.162 --> 05:30.915
get to know him a bit better.
Lynn's not big on sharing.

05:31.958 --> 05:34.168
That sounds
like someone I know.

05:34.335 --> 05:36.546
The thing is, I really do want
to get to know him better,

05:36.713 --> 05:39.716
which is pretty
fucking unusual for me.

05:41.134 --> 05:44.929
And I get that he might not want
to talk about back then,

05:45.096 --> 05:46.222
and about Brian, but--

05:46.389 --> 05:48.683
Oh, my God,
they look so handsome and happy.

05:48.850 --> 05:50.685
Sorry.

05:50.852 --> 05:52.353
No, it's fine. They do.

05:52.937 --> 05:54.147
Fuck.

05:55.106 --> 05:57.233
It's so... sad.

05:57.984 --> 05:59.819
Yeah, but at the same time,

05:59.986 --> 06:03.781
it has to be important
that he talks to me about this stuff.

06:03.948 --> 06:06.951
- Doesn't it?
- Well, "Happiness...

06:07.118 --> 06:09.454
...not in another place
but this place,

06:09.620 --> 06:12.832
not for another hour
but this hour."

06:13.833 --> 06:15.710
- Really?
- That's Walt Whitman.

06:15.877 --> 06:17.128
That's a great quote.

06:17.295 --> 06:19.797
I don't care who it is. Oh, God.

06:20.757 --> 06:24.385
God! Maybe I've just forgotten
what it's like to have a boyfriend.

06:24.844 --> 06:27.346
But doesn't that feel good,
to have a boyfriend?

06:27.513 --> 06:29.682
To be able to call him
your boyfriend?

06:29.807 --> 06:33.269
Can you even call
a 59-year-old man your boyfriend?

06:33.436 --> 06:36.022
You can call him
whatever you want.

06:36.189 --> 06:40.485
Yeah, you're right.
God, I need to calm the fuck down.

06:46.240 --> 06:47.867
- You okay?
- Yeah.

06:50.369 --> 06:53.748
You're... good about
Richie now, right?

06:54.499 --> 06:56.250
Yeah, I guess.
I mean...

06:56.417 --> 07:00.046
...I regret the way that I dealt with
everything, and I miss him, but...

07:07.553 --> 07:09.639
Do you ever do things
that surprise you?

07:11.099 --> 07:13.768
- What do you mean?
- You know, are you ever...

07:15.269 --> 07:17.438
...shocked by
your own behavior?

07:18.481 --> 07:20.733
Are we still talking
about Richie?

07:21.901 --> 07:24.779
Forget it.
It's not important.

07:24.946 --> 07:26.864
I actually think that I might
go for a walk right now

07:27.031 --> 07:29.242
before we hit
the Monopoly board,

07:29.408 --> 07:31.077
because I heard
a woodpecker outside.

07:31.244 --> 07:32.829
- I wanna go check it out.
- A woodpecker?

07:32.954 --> 07:34.413
You know, they actually
have them here.

07:34.580 --> 07:36.874
So will you keep
an ear out for Agustín?

07:37.041 --> 07:39.460
Well, what should I
be listening for?

07:39.627 --> 07:41.712
Well, if he's masturbating,
you can just leave him.

07:41.879 --> 07:43.840
- Ugh!
- But if he's crying, come get me.

07:44.006 --> 07:47.635
If it's both at the same time...

07:47.802 --> 07:48.970
...you're on your own.

07:49.053 --> 07:50.429
And that's been known
to happen on occasion.

07:50.596 --> 07:51.973
- Yikes.
- Don't tell him I told you that.

07:52.140 --> 07:53.391
I'll see you later.

07:53.558 --> 07:54.934
Okay.

08:36.475 --> 08:38.644
Oh! Oriental Avenue.

08:38.853 --> 08:40.062
Pay up, motherfucker.

08:40.229 --> 08:42.190
No, that's racist.
I'm not paying your rent.

08:42.356 --> 08:43.858
No, it's the street
that's racist, not me.

08:44.025 --> 08:45.526
Not that you're even
going to pay rent, anyway.

08:47.320 --> 08:49.197
I'm gonna give you
another chance. Go again.

08:49.363 --> 08:51.616
All right,
here we go, Paddy.

08:51.824 --> 08:52.992
What, are we turning?

08:53.117 --> 08:54.368
Paddle on
the other side now.

08:54.535 --> 08:55.786
But don't we wanna
go that way?

08:55.953 --> 08:57.163
We are! I'm just--

08:57.288 --> 08:58.331
We do want to go that way.

08:58.414 --> 08:59.498
I'm turning the boat around.

08:59.582 --> 09:02.251
So why are
we going backwards?

09:02.418 --> 09:05.004
Oh, my God.
Gayest beach ever.

09:05.171 --> 09:07.632
I had no idea
this beach was here.

09:07.798 --> 09:10.343
I had no idea there was
so much nakedness on this beach.

09:10.509 --> 09:12.386
We have arrived.

09:12.553 --> 09:14.513
I really think
we should just stop.

09:14.680 --> 09:16.307
Paddy, even you
could get laid if we stopped.

09:16.474 --> 09:17.642
No, no,
let's just keep going.

09:17.725 --> 09:19.560
We're honestly not going to make it
to the end of the river.

09:19.685 --> 09:21.437
No, come on.
We're going to pull into this beach.

09:21.604 --> 09:23.105
Onward ho.
We're just going to go forward.

09:23.272 --> 09:24.941
- Paddy, just relax.
- Eyes on the prize.

09:25.107 --> 09:26.400
God, this is beautiful.

09:26.484 --> 09:28.069
Dom, I think
we found our flow here.

09:28.236 --> 09:30.321
- Right?
- Oh, my God.

09:31.322 --> 09:32.740
There are some men up here.

09:33.324 --> 09:34.867
Smell that testosterone.

09:35.034 --> 09:36.577
We're hitting bear beach, baby.

09:36.744 --> 09:38.746
- That's a lot of man.
- Hey!

09:39.747 --> 09:41.249
- Hey, there!
- Do you know him?

09:41.415 --> 09:42.667
No, not at all.

09:42.875 --> 09:44.961
Come party
with the big boys.

09:45.169 --> 09:47.755
Oh. Sorry, I'm on orders
to be good.

09:47.922 --> 09:50.424
With fur like that,
there's no way you play good.

09:50.591 --> 09:52.260
Come to the woods tonight.

09:52.426 --> 09:53.636
Bring the clone
and the seal pup.

09:53.803 --> 09:55.429
- Everyone's welcome.
- "Seal pup"?

09:55.596 --> 09:57.014
Where in the woods?

09:57.181 --> 09:58.808
Faeries will guide you.

09:58.975 --> 10:01.018
- What is a seal pup?
- I think a seal pup is

10:01.185 --> 10:02.603
someone hairless
and a little chunky.

10:03.396 --> 10:05.481
Wait, he's calling me chunky?

10:08.484 --> 10:10.069
All we need now
is a shower,

10:10.236 --> 10:11.946
some bug spray,
a cold drink,

10:12.113 --> 10:13.447
and then we'll be ready
for board games.

10:13.614 --> 10:15.950
- Again? Board games?
- Yeah.

10:16.117 --> 10:17.368
Hello, bitches.

10:17.535 --> 10:19.328
- What the fuck?
- Yeah, exactly.

10:19.495 --> 10:21.163
What the fuck?

10:21.831 --> 10:23.416
So you guys thought
you were gonna have

10:23.582 --> 10:25.084
your little sausage party
without me?

10:25.251 --> 10:26.961
- Well, you were working.
- I was working,

10:27.128 --> 10:28.671
I was,
and then everybody died,

10:28.838 --> 10:30.923
and now I get
to get fucked up.

10:31.090 --> 10:33.134
- Oh, my God, Lynn's--
- It's not true.

10:33.301 --> 10:35.136
Lynn's liquor cabinet--

10:35.303 --> 10:37.138
- Fantastic. Fantastic.
- Jesus, Doris.

10:37.305 --> 10:38.472
- Oh, no.
- Oh, come on.

10:38.639 --> 10:41.225
- Here, I'll hold it for you.
- I think that Dame Gladioli

10:41.392 --> 10:43.436
of the Castro can afford
to buy more booze, all right?

10:43.602 --> 10:47.231
- How did you even get in?
- Agustín left his door open.

10:47.315 --> 10:48.482
I kind of...
I flew in like Peter Pan.

10:48.566 --> 10:49.567
Mmm!

10:49.650 --> 10:51.819
Okay, how do you even know
it was my door?

10:51.986 --> 10:53.779
'Cause it smelled
like misery,

10:53.946 --> 10:56.324
and I also found this
on your bunk bed.

10:56.490 --> 10:58.326
- Agustín.
- Busted.

10:58.492 --> 11:00.745
Agustín!

11:00.911 --> 11:03.456
Check yourself before you
wreck yourself. What's happening?

11:03.622 --> 11:04.749
- Either Clue or Parcheesi.
- Yes.

11:04.915 --> 11:06.125
- That's a fucking joke.
- No.

11:06.292 --> 11:09.670
Okay? There is no way
that Dom just paid $200 for a taxi...

11:09.837 --> 11:11.839
thank you...
to get me here for that.

11:12.006 --> 11:14.967
No. Clue's a really fun game.
Miss Scarlet, Colonel Mustard,

11:15.176 --> 11:16.886
- Professor Plum.
- Oh, my God. Oh, stop talking.

11:17.011 --> 11:18.095
- The wrench.
- Stop talking.

11:18.220 --> 11:19.597
We're not-- Oh, the wrench!
I forgot about that.

11:19.764 --> 11:21.098
We are not
doing that, okay?

11:21.265 --> 11:22.391
We're not doing that.
We're going out.

11:22.558 --> 11:24.101
- Yes!
- We're going out.

11:24.268 --> 11:25.895
All right.

11:26.103 --> 11:29.231
I'm sorry.
That painting of Lynn?

11:29.315 --> 11:30.691
- Dom...
- Oof.

11:30.858 --> 11:32.193
What the-- that's--
how do you...

11:32.360 --> 11:34.987
No words, really.

11:35.196 --> 11:37.865
You know what I mean?
Just kinda...

11:38.032 --> 11:39.825
Let's-- no, let's just
be quiet and think about it.

11:42.745 --> 11:43.829
This music is so disorienting.

11:43.954 --> 11:46.248
Is it coming from behind us
or in front of us? I can't tell.

11:46.415 --> 11:48.167
Maybe we need
to retrace our steps.

11:48.334 --> 11:51.295
There better be dykes here.
I'm like catnip for dykes.

11:51.462 --> 11:54.215
Beautiful faggots!

11:54.382 --> 11:57.385
Oh, my God. Tell us, tell us, are we
heading in the right direction?

11:57.551 --> 12:00.721
Only you can truly
answer that question.

12:00.888 --> 12:02.515
Oh, my God.
Is this happening?

12:02.723 --> 12:05.393
Look deep inside your soul
and tell me what you see.

12:05.559 --> 12:07.353
- Don't answer him.
- You know I have no soul.

12:07.520 --> 12:09.730
I think tonight we just need
directions to the party.

12:09.897 --> 12:12.066
- Yeah.
- Okay.

12:12.233 --> 12:15.152
So you're gonna go straight.

12:15.319 --> 12:16.904
You're going to see
some trash cans,

12:17.071 --> 12:19.824
take a left, and there is
the promised land

12:19.990 --> 12:22.326
where all your dreams
will come true.

12:22.493 --> 12:24.036
- Oh, my God. Wow.
- Thank you.

12:24.161 --> 12:25.496
Thank you,
kind and beautiful faerie.

12:25.663 --> 12:26.914
I have to touch your nipple
for one moment.

12:27.039 --> 12:28.457
Touch it, touch it.
This is for you.

12:28.624 --> 12:29.667
Oh.

12:29.834 --> 12:31.585
- Let it light up your life.
- Thank you.

12:31.752 --> 12:33.754
You're faerie welcome.

12:33.921 --> 12:36.465
It's a flashlight
and a glow stick.

12:36.632 --> 12:38.342
- Listen, don't be pissed.
- Agustín, you said no--

12:38.509 --> 12:40.094
- I said no drugs. What are you doing?
- What is that?

12:40.261 --> 12:41.512
- Thank you.
- You don't know what it is.

12:41.595 --> 12:42.805
- I trust Agustín.
- What is it?

12:42.972 --> 12:45.099
Oh, that's so sweet.
It's just molly.

12:45.266 --> 12:47.685
Okay, that's what we used
to call X, right? That's X?

12:47.852 --> 12:49.103
- Yup.
- I'm in! I'm in.

12:49.270 --> 12:52.106
- Oh, God, it's like 1994.
- Everyone's got one?

12:52.273 --> 12:54.108
I don't think
I've had sex since 1994.

12:54.275 --> 12:55.901
Hanging out with you guys,
not so good for my vagina.

12:56.026 --> 12:57.820
Okay, promise you'll take care
of me if I have a heart attack

12:57.903 --> 12:59.113
or get gang-raped or something.

12:59.196 --> 13:00.573
Of course. I'm a nurse.
I'll take care of you,

13:00.698 --> 13:02.283
and I'll be gang-raping you.
I'll be the one doing it.

13:02.366 --> 13:03.534
You're in a safe place.

13:03.617 --> 13:05.119
As long as we're doing
something together, right?

13:05.286 --> 13:06.620
Yes. Cheers, cheers,
cheers, cheers.

13:06.704 --> 13:08.456
Cheers, cheers, cheers.
Oh, my God.

13:08.622 --> 13:10.207
Mmm!

13:10.374 --> 13:12.626
I just did molly.
I can't believe it.

13:12.793 --> 13:14.044
You didn't actually
swallow it, did you?

13:14.211 --> 13:16.046
I did. You're not supposed
to swallow it?

13:16.213 --> 13:17.548
Of course!

13:17.798 --> 13:19.175
- You swallowed it, right?
- Of course!

13:19.258 --> 13:20.426
- For real?
- Yes, yes, yes.

13:20.551 --> 13:21.719
You're not fucking with me?

13:21.886 --> 13:23.137
Oh, my God, isn't it fun?

13:23.345 --> 13:25.222
Funny, you're having fun?

13:25.389 --> 13:26.932
Looks pretty cool.

13:27.099 --> 13:30.269
- Yeah.
- This is incredible.

13:30.478 --> 13:32.396
- I'm so glad we came.
- That faerie wasn't lying.

13:32.563 --> 13:34.982
- Dom, are you feeling it yet?
- A little, but not really.

13:35.149 --> 13:36.859
I think it's just like--
This is surreal, anyway.

13:37.026 --> 13:39.236
The Promised Land,
for one night only.

13:39.403 --> 13:41.155
I'm trying to figure out
what I'm looking at.

13:41.322 --> 13:43.491
- What am I seeing?
- You'll be fine, Paddy.

13:43.657 --> 13:44.992
Okay.
Just stay close.

13:45.159 --> 13:46.660
Okay.
I'm not gonna leave you.

13:54.877 --> 13:56.128
Hi, sweetie.

13:58.547 --> 14:00.716
These are my friends.

14:24.198 --> 14:25.533
When will I know
if it's working?

14:25.699 --> 14:28.035
I'm kinda feeling something,
but I can't tell.

14:28.202 --> 14:30.538
Trust me.
You'll know, buddy. You'll know.

14:33.290 --> 14:37.878
Listen, I want you to know
that I do appreciate everything.

14:38.128 --> 14:40.589
Letting me move in,
the rent...

14:40.756 --> 14:43.133
This weekend. Come on.

14:43.300 --> 14:45.177
Believe it or not,
we are just trying to help.

14:46.136 --> 14:47.888
I know you are.
I'll tell you what,

14:48.055 --> 14:51.267
if or when I need it,
I promise I'll come to you.

14:51.976 --> 14:54.562
I don't care who you go to,
as long as you go to somebody.

14:55.187 --> 14:57.523
What I need you to understand
is that you and I,

14:57.690 --> 15:01.151
- we do things differently.
- What does that mean?

15:01.318 --> 15:03.362
Well, I deal with...

15:03.487 --> 15:04.905
...with feeling
like a shitty person

15:05.072 --> 15:07.741
by being bad.
You do it by being good.

15:10.786 --> 15:12.746
What makes you think
I've been good?

15:13.247 --> 15:14.873
Haven't you been?

15:15.666 --> 15:17.126
I don't feel
like I've been good,

15:17.543 --> 15:19.420
certainly not recently.

15:19.587 --> 15:21.463
Why not recently?

15:22.381 --> 15:24.216
- No.
- Oh? Oh?

15:24.842 --> 15:27.678
I've been wanting to confess
something to you for a while now,

15:27.886 --> 15:30.097
and I'm not quite sure
why I haven't told you.

15:30.264 --> 15:31.932
- Uh-huh.
- Fuck.

15:32.099 --> 15:34.351
- Whoa. You okay?
- Oh, fuck.

15:34.518 --> 15:37.104
Okay, okay. Breathe.
Yeah, yeah, breathe.

15:37.271 --> 15:38.856
- Okay. All right, all right.
- Oh, shit.

15:39.023 --> 15:41.483
Gimme those eyes, baby.
Yeah, let it in.

15:41.650 --> 15:43.611
- Whoa.
- How you feel?

15:44.153 --> 15:47.072
Yes. All right, you know what
we're gonna do right now?

15:47.239 --> 15:48.532
- What?
- We're gonna fucking dance.

15:48.699 --> 15:50.534
- Okay. Let's go dancing.
- Yeah?

15:50.701 --> 15:51.869
Dom!

15:52.870 --> 15:53.912
Dom!

15:57.416 --> 16:00.961
- Look who's here.
- Hey.

16:02.630 --> 16:04.465
Okay.

16:12.806 --> 16:14.141
Oh, shit.

18:23.353 --> 18:25.522
Hey!

18:26.231 --> 18:28.025
Can you hear me?

18:29.276 --> 18:30.778
What are you doing?

18:31.820 --> 18:33.280
Right now.

18:35.282 --> 18:37.409
Yes, right now!

18:41.121 --> 18:42.748
Come on.
It's gonna be so cold.

18:42.873 --> 18:45.292
- You said you were hot.
- Fuck it. All right.

18:49.004 --> 18:50.923
I'm gonna beat you
into the stream.

18:59.431 --> 19:00.682
Whoo!

19:19.159 --> 19:21.161
Is that your dad?

19:22.329 --> 19:24.998
- What?
- This guy.

19:25.165 --> 19:27.084
Is that your dad?

19:27.251 --> 19:29.670
No, that's not my dad.

19:30.420 --> 19:32.256
This is my boyfriend.

19:32.422 --> 19:34.216
- Oh.
- Mmm.

19:34.383 --> 19:36.134
Is he still that hot?

19:36.301 --> 19:39.471
Yeah. Hotter.
Why, you want me to leave it open?

19:39.638 --> 19:42.474
- Yeah. Open that back up.
- Fuck you.

19:47.521 --> 19:49.231
Does he mind you
fucking around?

19:49.398 --> 19:50.858
No.

19:52.442 --> 19:54.152
He really doesn't.

19:55.279 --> 19:57.698
Lucky you.

20:03.328 --> 20:05.038
Lucky for both of us.

20:08.208 --> 20:11.545
Are you--
so, um, are you single?

20:11.712 --> 20:13.589
Yeah, but only recently.

20:13.755 --> 20:15.632
Oh, so you're fucked up.

20:15.799 --> 20:18.176
Pretty fucking much.

20:18.343 --> 20:20.220
Yeah, it turns out I...

20:20.387 --> 20:22.055
...loved him
more than I thought.

20:22.222 --> 20:25.350
Don't worry about it, honey.
Happens to us all.

20:28.395 --> 20:31.189
So what do you do with your life now
to make it at least bearable?

20:31.857 --> 20:33.233
Ooh. Well...

20:33.400 --> 20:36.570
...I was a mediocre artist.

20:36.737 --> 20:39.489
I gave that up...

20:40.449 --> 20:43.201
...which is a good thing
for the world, I think.

20:44.745 --> 20:46.371
Yeah.

20:46.538 --> 20:49.416
So I suppose now
I guess I do... nothing.

20:49.583 --> 20:52.252
Nothing at all.

20:52.419 --> 20:54.171
How does that
make you feel?

20:54.338 --> 20:58.091
No.

21:00.177 --> 21:01.720
No, no, no, don't do it.

21:01.887 --> 21:04.264
I promise,
no more questions. I swear.

21:07.100 --> 21:08.435
What do you do?

21:09.770 --> 21:11.730
I work for a homeless shelter
that supports

21:11.897 --> 21:13.565
gay and transgender teens.

21:13.732 --> 21:15.943
What? Get the fuck
out of here.

21:16.109 --> 21:17.819
- Really?
- It's me.

21:17.986 --> 21:20.614
Call me Saint Eddie, the hairy-ass
mother of the mission.

21:20.781 --> 21:22.950
You can drown me now,
Saint Eddie.

21:23.116 --> 21:26.161
No. I wanna hang out with you
a little bit more first,

21:26.328 --> 21:28.372
- and then maybe I'll drown you.
- Deal.

21:28.538 --> 21:29.873
Okay.

21:30.916 --> 21:32.542
- Drown time.
- No, no!

21:32.709 --> 21:34.127
Oh, shit.

21:35.128 --> 21:36.922
Let me see.

21:37.089 --> 21:38.799
Oh, cool tattoo.

21:38.966 --> 21:40.592
Thanks.

21:57.567 --> 21:59.152
Hey, handsome.

21:59.319 --> 22:00.821
Hello.

22:00.988 --> 22:02.864
Good of you to drop by.

22:04.366 --> 22:06.118
This had
better be worth it.

22:06.284 --> 22:09.329
Oh, it's gonna be worth it.

22:16.795 --> 22:18.964
Come here.

22:23.510 --> 22:25.012
I want you to fuck me.

22:26.638 --> 22:29.599
- I'm not kidding.
- What? What, here in the woods?

22:31.768 --> 22:35.480
Patrick, you're so fucking hot.

22:37.024 --> 22:38.817
You are making
my head explode.

22:38.984 --> 22:40.569
- Do you have a condom?
- Uh-huh.

22:40.736 --> 22:42.738
Against this tree.

22:43.780 --> 22:45.407
Oh, fuck.

22:51.288 --> 22:52.914
Hmm?

23:07.721 --> 23:09.598
Oh, fuck.

23:32.245 --> 23:33.663
Okay.

23:33.830 --> 23:35.332
So we've done it
on the floor at work.

23:35.499 --> 23:36.583
Yup.

23:36.666 --> 23:37.751
We did it
in the storeroom.

23:37.918 --> 23:40.170
Yeah. I tossed you off
in the conference room.

23:40.504 --> 23:42.005
You gave me a blowjob
in the breakroom.

23:42.172 --> 23:43.423
- I did.
- Yeah.

23:44.382 --> 23:45.717
You think we're ever
gonna actually get to do it

23:45.842 --> 23:47.552
in a real bed sometime?

23:50.013 --> 23:51.389
I hope so.

23:55.519 --> 23:57.104
Do that again.

23:57.270 --> 24:00.357
Maybe it's the molly,
but I can feel it in my toes.

24:07.114 --> 24:08.532
Mmm.

24:08.698 --> 24:10.700
Oh...

24:10.867 --> 24:13.703
- Hey, Paddy.
- Yes!

24:13.870 --> 24:14.913
- All right.
- Morning, boys.

24:15.080 --> 24:18.416
- We were worried.
- Thank you.

24:18.583 --> 24:21.503
You so fucked that hot guy
in the cap, didn't you?

24:21.670 --> 24:23.755
Well, I finally did it
in the woods.

24:23.922 --> 24:25.132
Yes!

24:25.298 --> 24:27.467
Agustín made
a new friend, too.

24:27.634 --> 24:30.095
- Mmm.
- Yeah, I did. He's cute.

24:30.262 --> 24:32.472
A big bear who cares
about trans people

24:32.639 --> 24:33.890
and has a house in Virginia.

24:33.974 --> 24:36.101
Oh, I've always wanted
to visit the South.

24:37.144 --> 24:39.437
A house in Virginia--

24:39.604 --> 24:41.648
- He's HIV positive.
- Oh.

24:41.815 --> 24:44.484
And Dom popped the cherry
on his open relationship, too.

24:44.651 --> 24:47.571
- Well!
- Yes, I did, and it was fun.

24:48.905 --> 24:50.907
- No blood or tears.
- Good.

24:51.074 --> 24:52.784
What about Doris?

24:53.535 --> 24:56.621
Last I saw, Doris was
on the back of a jet ski,

24:56.746 --> 24:58.165
topless.

24:58.331 --> 25:00.250
I think we may have
lost her to the lesbians.

25:04.880 --> 25:06.590
So, um...

25:08.091 --> 25:09.384
Okay, I did
have sex last night,

25:09.551 --> 25:11.928
but I did not have sex
with the cute guy in the hat.

25:13.346 --> 25:15.599
I had sex with Kevin.

25:17.017 --> 25:19.978
- Kevin Kevin?
- I called him and he came up,

25:20.103 --> 25:21.855
and he fucked me in the butt
against a tree.

25:22.022 --> 25:23.690
What the fuck?

25:23.857 --> 25:25.442
Yeah, and it's happened
a few times now.

25:25.609 --> 25:27.319
The first time was
the night of the pop-up

25:27.485 --> 25:28.612
when Richie and I broke up.

25:28.778 --> 25:29.988
Certainly not
my proudest moment.

25:30.155 --> 25:32.866
Why didn't you
tell us, Paddy?

25:33.033 --> 25:34.159
Oh, he's still got
the boyfriend, right?

25:34.367 --> 25:35.619
- Yeah.
- Oh.

25:35.827 --> 25:38.205
And I thought
this weekend, I'd...

25:38.371 --> 25:40.540
...you know, be able
to put a stop to it, but...

25:42.792 --> 25:44.211
...I can't.

25:44.377 --> 25:45.921
Fuck.

25:46.630 --> 25:49.341
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

25:50.717 --> 25:52.510
I don't know. Can we just
not talk about it now?

25:52.677 --> 25:56.097
Tomorrow you can tell me everything
I probably already know, but...

25:56.264 --> 25:59.768
...now can we just
all watch the sunrise and...

25:59.935 --> 26:01.853
...pretend that everything's
gonna turn out fine?

26:02.020 --> 26:04.481
- That is okay with me.
- Okay.

26:04.648 --> 26:06.191
Me, too.
