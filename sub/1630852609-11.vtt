WEBVTT

00:01.068 --> 00:03.203
This is not RuPaul's
Best Friend Race.

00:03.203 --> 00:04.771
I feel very attacked!

00:04.771 --> 00:07.808
If you don't have star quality,
get the fuck outta here.

00:07.808 --> 00:10.544
Oh, my God.

00:10.544 --> 00:14.348
RuPaul: This is Untucked,
backstage at the competition

00:14.348 --> 00:18.352
to become America's
next drag superstar.

00:18.352 --> 00:20.254
Girl, if you're not watching
Untucked,

00:20.254 --> 00:22.923
you're only getting
half the story.

00:28.795 --> 00:30.397
Baby, we deserve
some drinks now.

00:30.397 --> 00:31.798
Hell, yeah.

00:31.798 --> 00:33.533
That was a lot of doing.

00:33.533 --> 00:35.302
-Oh.
-Oh, now that.

00:35.302 --> 00:37.604
Shall we cheers
to top seven?

00:37.604 --> 00:39.373
[cheering]

00:39.373 --> 00:42.609
We've all kind of fallen in love
with Jasmine this season,

00:42.609 --> 00:46.046
but we all feel peace
with Jasmine going home.

00:46.046 --> 00:49.049
It did feel like
it was her time to go.

00:49.049 --> 00:51.585
That sounds, like,
kind of cheap to say,

00:51.585 --> 00:53.420
but that's just the case
at this point.

00:53.420 --> 00:55.923
So this smackdown
that y'all did today,

00:55.923 --> 00:58.692
did it give you some
reinvigoration or some--

00:58.692 --> 01:00.193
Yay-ya!

01:00.193 --> 01:01.561
Yay-ya, it did.

01:01.561 --> 01:03.630
I know for me it sure did,
because, girl,

01:03.630 --> 01:06.600
I was battling a lot
of fucking, like, inner demons.

01:06.600 --> 01:09.870
Oh, my God, I was just so
frustrated and I was so tired.

01:09.870 --> 01:12.639
But now, bitch,
my gears are going now,

01:12.639 --> 01:14.875
and I feel so much more
confident in myself,

01:14.875 --> 01:16.877
and, like, bitch, I'm ready
for this next challenge.

01:16.877 --> 01:18.545
Snatch Game was the challenge

01:18.545 --> 01:20.881
I was the most terrified
of doing.

01:20.881 --> 01:24.818
Then whenever we were told
that we all were shit--

01:24.818 --> 01:26.253
Who's "we all?"

01:27.621 --> 01:29.756
Well, except for you, DeJa.
[all laugh]

01:29.756 --> 01:32.259
Normally, it would be
annoying to hear,

01:32.259 --> 01:33.827
like, someone
talking about their win

01:33.827 --> 01:34.962
when we're all in the bottom,

01:34.962 --> 01:37.497
but I do feel
really proud of DeJa.

01:37.497 --> 01:40.033
I know that DeJa's
worked really hard,

01:40.033 --> 01:42.869
and I've wanted her
to get a win.

01:42.869 --> 01:47.607
DeJa Skye, you took a big swing,
and you scored.

01:47.607 --> 01:50.811
Con-drag-ulations. You're the
winner of this week's challenge.

01:50.811 --> 01:52.279
[cheers and applause]
Bitch, you won!

01:52.279 --> 01:53.647
Oh, my God.

01:53.647 --> 01:57.050
I do have to say
this is, like, Sean Icon-nery

01:57.050 --> 02:00.387
in the fact that, like,
we had a full episode

02:00.387 --> 02:03.657
dedicated to lip syncing,
and that feels kind of cool.

02:03.657 --> 02:06.727
We sucked so hard that we set
ourselves apart from the pack

02:06.727 --> 02:09.029
as far as, like,
the seasons go.

02:09.029 --> 02:12.699
We sucked so bad,
we made herstory, girl.

02:12.699 --> 02:14.368
-Ooh!
-Yay-ya!

02:14.368 --> 02:16.403
Shake your maracas.

02:16.403 --> 02:18.171
RuPaul: Shake your maracas.

02:18.171 --> 02:21.375
It's so important to be worldly
and environmentally conscience.

02:23.143 --> 02:28.949
Reading is important,
and, uh--uh--uh, school choice.

02:28.949 --> 02:31.485
Her pudenda is awful, Ru.

02:31.485 --> 02:33.020
Okay.

02:34.388 --> 02:35.589
Now that we're through it

02:35.589 --> 02:37.090
and that's the one
I was scared most of,

02:37.090 --> 02:39.659
I'm ready just to have
a good-ass time.

02:39.659 --> 02:41.094
Like, I'm not stressed at all.

02:42.195 --> 02:44.197
A little stressed.
A little bit.

02:44.197 --> 02:45.999
We were literally just, like,

02:45.999 --> 02:48.435
fucking just, like,
jabbed and shish-kebabed.

02:48.435 --> 02:50.203
We just got shish-kebabed, girl.

02:50.203 --> 02:52.072
RuPaul just, like,
fucking served us up.

02:52.072 --> 02:54.541
She was not feeling
any of our asses.

02:54.541 --> 02:57.744
Jorgeous, I do not want you
to get down on yourself.

02:57.744 --> 03:01.048
-Okay.
-You were all equally as bad.

03:01.048 --> 03:04.351
[all laugh]

03:04.351 --> 03:05.652
She ain't lying.

03:05.652 --> 03:06.920
I'm sorry, my dears,

03:06.920 --> 03:10.390
but you are all
up for elimination.

03:10.390 --> 03:12.526
Shut the...

03:13.960 --> 03:17.297
I'm thankful that I am
not the one that went home,

03:17.297 --> 03:20.600
but I was feeling like fucking
disappointed with myself.

03:20.600 --> 03:25.005
I consider myself funny,
but it's not enough.

03:25.005 --> 03:28.575
I hear you have
another candle coming out.

03:28.575 --> 03:32.345
Oh, my God, are you a fan
of my yonic light bearers?

03:32.345 --> 03:33.580
What does this one smell like?

03:33.580 --> 03:36.116
Yonic.

03:37.317 --> 03:39.152
I feel good.

03:39.152 --> 03:43.623
I feel like I really gave it
my all in the lip sync.

03:43.623 --> 03:45.292
Bitch, all I saw was lights,

03:45.292 --> 03:47.961
and it's like,
okay, bitch, turn it on.

03:47.961 --> 03:50.697
And it does give you,
like, a new outlook,

03:50.697 --> 03:52.599
because it makes you feel like
you have something to prove,

03:52.599 --> 03:53.967
like, after you've done that.

03:53.967 --> 03:56.103
But it also is, like,
exhilarating, too,

03:56.103 --> 03:57.204
so it, like, you know,

03:57.204 --> 03:59.106
you kind of carry
that fire with you.

03:59.106 --> 04:00.173
Because there's been girls

04:00.173 --> 04:01.374
that have gone
all the way to the top

04:01.374 --> 04:02.776
without having to lip sync,

04:02.776 --> 04:05.779
and essentially, this is what
we kind of do on a daily.

04:05.779 --> 04:08.648
So I think it proves to Ru
that, like, we are not all talk.

04:08.648 --> 04:11.017
We actually have the chops
that we say we do.

04:11.017 --> 04:12.085
Just not in Snatch Game.

04:12.085 --> 04:14.387
Yeah.

04:14.387 --> 04:16.656
I think everyone that is here

04:16.656 --> 04:20.460
was who I thought deserved it
the most to be here,

04:20.460 --> 04:22.028
just because
of our track record.

04:22.028 --> 04:24.498
I do love Jasmine,
but I just think

04:24.498 --> 04:27.968
that it would have been a very
confusing and bittersweet moment

04:27.968 --> 04:30.904
if she took
one of your guys' spots.

04:30.904 --> 04:33.840
Jasmine has sashayed away.
She gets annoying at times,

04:33.840 --> 04:35.408
but I really did bond with her,

04:35.408 --> 04:36.843
and she was the first person

04:36.843 --> 04:39.279
to just take every joke
with a grain of salt

04:39.279 --> 04:40.914
and be like, girl,
I fucking love you.

04:40.914 --> 04:43.316
So I'm going to miss her.

04:43.316 --> 04:47.120
If I had, like, two wins and
she has four bottoms in a row,

04:47.120 --> 04:48.922
I'm just, like, I really don't
want you to take my spot.

04:48.922 --> 04:50.891
How does that work out? Yeah.

04:50.891 --> 04:52.425
It's like, I know
it's not, like,

04:52.425 --> 04:55.529
necessarily a math formula
that takes you through this,

04:55.529 --> 04:56.830
but at the same time,

04:56.830 --> 04:59.432
I'm just like, bitch,
I'm not leaving yet.

04:59.432 --> 05:03.670
Bosco has done exceptionally
well in this competition,

05:03.670 --> 05:05.839
a lot better than Jasmine.

05:05.839 --> 05:10.544
However, in this instance,
Jasmine gave it her all.

05:10.544 --> 05:13.046
This is how
this competition is.

05:13.046 --> 05:16.082
It's scary.
One little fumble,

05:16.082 --> 05:19.052
and Bosco could have been
going home right now.

05:19.052 --> 05:21.254
I will at least say that,
bitch, about Jasmine,

05:21.254 --> 05:22.923
like, going into this,

05:22.923 --> 05:26.426
I'm like this may actually
be on her alley,

05:26.426 --> 05:27.360
because, you know, it's like--

05:27.360 --> 05:28.528
I hear that.

05:28.528 --> 05:30.797
Yeah, because
looking at the songs, girl,

05:30.797 --> 05:32.065
I'm like, ooh,

05:32.065 --> 05:34.267
if Jasmine get any of these
songs right here, girl,

05:34.267 --> 05:36.870
she might just
wear us out, girl.

05:36.870 --> 05:38.538
Jesus fucking Christ.

05:38.538 --> 05:39.906
Man.

05:43.410 --> 05:44.711
What about you, Cam-Cam?

05:44.711 --> 05:48.248
-So I do have emotions.
-Gross.

05:48.248 --> 05:49.916
Yeah, no, I don't know, man.

05:49.916 --> 05:51.918
Something just
kind of came over me.

05:51.918 --> 05:56.056
Lady Camden, shantay you stay.

05:57.724 --> 05:59.426
I was going through it
beforehand,

05:59.426 --> 06:00.827
before the second one
for sure.

06:00.827 --> 06:02.629
I was like, this could be
my last one, you know.

06:02.629 --> 06:04.197
Give it your all.

06:04.197 --> 06:06.766
I also was kind of thinking
about my drag mum,

06:06.766 --> 06:09.236
how much I kind of miss her

06:09.236 --> 06:11.438
and what I would do
to just have a hug from her.

06:11.438 --> 06:13.907
She just is everything to me,

06:13.907 --> 06:16.076
and so, like, I just
was thinking about her,

06:16.076 --> 06:18.778
and just imagining that she
was there with the cameraman,

06:18.778 --> 06:21.181
you know, just kind of there,
like, happy to see me,

06:21.181 --> 06:23.483
and it just made me
so emotional.

06:23.483 --> 06:26.786
My drag mother is more of
a sort of mother figure to me

06:26.786 --> 06:28.922
in terms of emotional support.

06:28.922 --> 06:31.691
She's always kind of been
my little guardian angel.

06:31.691 --> 06:32.892
She was always someone

06:32.892 --> 06:35.595
that reminded me
not to second guess myself.

06:35.595 --> 06:36.830
As soon as I got offstage,

06:36.830 --> 06:39.232
I just kept thinking
I just want a hug so bad.

06:39.232 --> 06:40.667
And I thought about
you guys being here,

06:40.667 --> 06:42.736
and I was, like, "I want
my friends right now."

06:42.736 --> 06:44.971
Like, I just lost it,
you know.

06:44.971 --> 06:46.973
This is just
such a hard competition.

06:46.973 --> 06:50.076
It doesn't just test
your ability to lip sync,

06:50.076 --> 06:52.746
your ability to paint your face
in a beautiful way.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.681
It really does test,
like, your emotions

06:54.681 --> 06:56.249
in such a different way, man.

06:56.249 --> 06:58.184
It tests your character.

06:58.184 --> 07:00.253
It tests your character,
but also your ability to go,

07:00.253 --> 07:03.156
you know, hey, someone just told
you that you did a shit job.

07:03.156 --> 07:06.192
Can you bounce back?

07:06.192 --> 07:07.560
It's, like, Willow last night

07:07.560 --> 07:10.196
was, like, "All my friends
are at home probably going,

07:10.196 --> 07:11.998
'Wow, she's made it so far,

07:11.998 --> 07:13.466
but we're still on
eight people.'"

07:13.466 --> 07:15.702
I know!
[all laugh]

07:15.702 --> 07:18.138
-Yay-ya!
-Literally.

07:18.138 --> 07:20.006
So, Daya, how are you
feeling lately?

07:20.006 --> 07:21.341
Because I know that some
of the queens have voiced

07:21.341 --> 07:22.509
that you've been kind of

07:22.509 --> 07:25.011
just really unfiltered
with your opinions.

07:27.213 --> 07:29.449
I think for me it's, like,

07:29.449 --> 07:32.652
I'm just saying what's
on my mind in the moment.

07:32.652 --> 07:34.654
That's how I feel.

07:34.654 --> 07:38.591
Daya is impulsive, where she
just spews what's on her mind.

07:38.591 --> 07:42.462
And, yes, it's slightly bratty,

07:42.462 --> 07:45.298
but I understand
where Daya's coming from.

07:45.298 --> 07:47.500
If people look at me thinking
I'm being an asshole about it,

07:47.500 --> 07:49.002
I'm just doing what I gotta do.

07:49.002 --> 07:51.604
For me to do well
in this competition,

07:51.604 --> 07:54.274
I feel like I need to say it,
I need to get it out there.

07:54.274 --> 07:56.543
And I am the type of person
that does that.

07:56.543 --> 07:58.311
I don't--I try
not to hold it in,

07:58.311 --> 08:00.447
because then it really
drives my mind crazy.

08:00.447 --> 08:06.152
I hope nobody is thinking I'm
being really, like, standoffish

08:06.152 --> 08:07.554
or being a bitch or anything.

08:09.656 --> 08:11.691
So, I--

08:11.691 --> 08:13.326
okay, so let me
say this first.

08:13.326 --> 08:15.061
Go ahead.

08:15.061 --> 08:17.497
Sometimes with you
speaking in the moment,

08:17.497 --> 08:20.533
it seems very pointed
at certain people,

08:20.533 --> 08:24.471
and that comes off unwarranted.

08:25.839 --> 08:29.376
When it's like,
oh, this is how I feel,

08:29.376 --> 08:31.411
and you should have went home,

08:31.411 --> 08:33.113
and even if you're not,
like, saying it,

08:33.113 --> 08:36.349
sometimes it sounds like
that's what you're insinuating,

08:36.349 --> 08:37.984
like the Jasmine situation.

08:37.984 --> 08:39.586
Y'all bitches better beware

08:39.586 --> 08:41.588
if you're in the bottom
with us, okay?

08:41.588 --> 08:44.891
Whatever.
It wasn't that good.

08:47.460 --> 08:49.129
Even if you don't,
like, outright say,

08:49.129 --> 08:50.463
oh, I feel like
you should go home,

08:50.463 --> 08:54.434
sometimes your words
make people feel that way.

08:54.434 --> 08:56.636
You know, is there some truth

08:56.636 --> 09:00.373
behind that irritability
of the person I'm calling out?

09:00.373 --> 09:02.475
Absolutely.
I'm not gonna deny that.

09:02.475 --> 09:05.278
Jasmine was
a huge stressor for me

09:05.278 --> 09:08.081
because she was just so much
all the time

09:08.081 --> 09:09.249
and wouldn't shut up.

09:09.249 --> 09:11.818
It was frustrating.

09:11.818 --> 09:16.222
Everyone's looking at me
like I have a sour face.

09:16.222 --> 09:19.058
It makes me feel like
I'm being Bitter Betty

09:19.058 --> 09:21.161
when in reality I know
these bitches are thinking it.

09:21.161 --> 09:22.929
I'm just the one
that's saying it.

09:22.929 --> 09:24.931
I have to say, I really
appreciate the fact

09:24.931 --> 09:26.332
that you voice your feelings,
because, like,

09:26.332 --> 09:31.204
I'm somebody who does almost
all of my processing internally.

09:31.204 --> 09:33.440
So, like,
hearing you work through

09:33.440 --> 09:36.109
a lot of things in real time
makes me feel nicer.

09:36.109 --> 09:37.510
And then a lot of times,

09:37.510 --> 09:40.046
I share, like, your opinions
or frustrations with things.

09:40.046 --> 09:43.316
So it feels nice that,
like, it is being aired.

09:43.316 --> 09:47.120
So I personally like it.
[laughs]

09:47.120 --> 09:51.291
I'm really happy Bosco can admit
that she also felt the same way,

09:51.291 --> 09:55.195
because I knew from the get-go
she was feeling that way.

09:55.195 --> 09:56.863
And I'm also really petty

09:56.863 --> 09:59.265
and just, like,
a little drama piggy,

09:59.265 --> 10:00.433
so, like, if you want to, like,

10:00.433 --> 10:03.269
start as much shit
as possible, please do.

10:03.269 --> 10:05.238
No, it's not me
ever starting shit.

10:05.238 --> 10:09.409
If I tell you something,
I genuinely mean it.

10:09.409 --> 10:11.945
I'm not gonna fucking
just beat around the bush.

10:11.945 --> 10:15.915
But I'm glad--I am glad,
because last week I did feel

10:15.915 --> 10:17.851
like I was kind of
the only one that spoke out,

10:17.851 --> 10:21.855
and was, like, fuck,
another week with all of us?

10:21.855 --> 10:24.657
You've been in the bottom a lot.

10:24.657 --> 10:26.593
Ugh! It's just fucking
annoying at this point.

10:26.593 --> 10:28.661
I'm, like, getting
really overwhelmed,

10:28.661 --> 10:31.197
and it's starting to really
piss me the fuck off.

10:32.198 --> 10:33.500
But I knew that some of us

10:33.500 --> 10:34.901
probably were feeling that way,

10:34.901 --> 10:37.337
and if I have to be the martyr,
in a sense, for it--

10:37.337 --> 10:39.072
-I think most of us did.
-Yeah.

10:39.072 --> 10:40.840
Like, I was feeling pissed.

10:40.840 --> 10:42.442
There was, like,
a lot of emotions

10:42.442 --> 10:44.677
all happening at once
in that moment.

10:44.677 --> 10:46.312
And it was hard
for me to just admit

10:46.312 --> 10:49.249
that, like, God, we were all
in the fucking bottom.

10:49.249 --> 10:50.884
That was so annoying.

10:50.884 --> 10:52.585
What do you guys fucking think
is gonna happen next?

10:52.585 --> 10:54.087
For the next challenge,

10:54.087 --> 10:57.657
I would like to do something
that I will find enjoyment in.

10:57.657 --> 10:58.892
Yeah.

10:58.892 --> 11:01.060
I would live for stand-up.

11:01.060 --> 11:02.996
I mean, I'd rather sit down.

11:02.996 --> 11:05.965
You spent the whole episode
sitting down, bitch.

11:05.965 --> 11:07.433
-Oh!
-[laughs]

11:07.433 --> 11:09.068
There's also
a makeover challenge.

11:09.068 --> 11:11.638
I was about to say, I'm ready
to make somebody over.

11:11.638 --> 11:13.106
Oh, yeah, I forgot about that.

11:13.106 --> 11:17.110
I would like to be made over
by DeJa, Jorgeous, and Bosco.

11:17.110 --> 11:18.177
Yes.

11:18.177 --> 11:20.079
Well, fuck me
and Camden and Daya.

11:20.079 --> 11:22.181
What, bitch?

11:22.181 --> 11:24.050
I wanna get my face beat
by Jorgeous.

11:24.050 --> 11:26.219
-Yes, I would be so down.
-Oh, my God.

11:26.219 --> 11:29.556
So do y'all, like, miss
any of the eliminated girls?

11:29.556 --> 11:31.291
Kornbread for sure.

11:31.291 --> 11:33.192
I miss Kornbread and Kerri.

11:33.192 --> 11:34.861
-I miss Kerri.
-Yeah, I miss Kerri, too.

11:34.861 --> 11:36.396
Just so real
and, like, authentic.

11:36.396 --> 11:38.865
I kind of miss Maddy,
you know,

11:38.865 --> 11:40.700
She got a little flirty with me
towards the end.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.068
Oh, did she?

11:42.068 --> 11:43.570
You and your dump truck?

11:43.570 --> 11:44.604
She loves a strong woman.

11:44.604 --> 11:46.039
-Girlfriend, don't come for me.
-Yeah.

11:46.039 --> 11:49.442
I think she's kind of cute
as a boy.

11:49.442 --> 11:50.910
If someone
would walk in the door,

11:50.910 --> 11:52.779
I think the person I'd be most
excited to see would be Maddy.

11:55.214 --> 11:56.516
But I don't wanna see
any of them.

11:56.516 --> 11:57.917
-Okay?
-[laughs]

11:57.917 --> 11:59.752
No, we just got rid of someone.

11:59.752 --> 12:01.120
I'm, like, basking in that.

12:01.120 --> 12:02.455
I'm barely getting
y'all out, bitch.

12:02.455 --> 12:04.357
I don't want nobody else
coming up in here.

12:04.357 --> 12:05.925
You know who I really miss,
and honestly, like,

12:05.925 --> 12:07.994
it's been so long since
she's been gone is Bosco.

12:07.994 --> 12:10.496
-Like, I miss her.
-Shut up.

12:10.496 --> 12:12.498
She's just been
in the bathroom too long.

12:12.498 --> 12:15.501
-She's back.
-Bosco!

12:15.501 --> 12:17.337
DeJa missed you so much.

12:17.337 --> 12:19.339
I had to pee.

12:19.339 --> 12:22.342
It was so cool getting to see
everyone lip sync,

12:22.342 --> 12:24.611
because, bitches, like,
y'all make me nervous now,

12:24.611 --> 12:26.412
because y'all know how
to fucking lip sync.

12:26.412 --> 12:29.816
Honestly, I'm just swearing
like I'm nervous,

12:29.816 --> 12:31.718
just to make the other girls
feel comfortable.

12:31.718 --> 12:32.885
You know what I mean?

12:32.885 --> 12:34.954
I just can't be nervous,

12:34.954 --> 12:38.391
because I'm the best
lip syncer here.

12:38.391 --> 12:43.229
What I love is any one of us
could make the top four.

12:43.229 --> 12:46.165
There's no kind of,
like, clear--

12:46.165 --> 12:49.535
We're all at the same level
at this moment,

12:50.436 --> 12:52.038
and that's crazy,

12:52.038 --> 12:54.040
because every other season,

12:54.040 --> 12:55.875
you kind of like, oh, they're
gonna, oh, they're gonna.

12:55.875 --> 12:58.911
Yeah. Everybody is on
the same playing field.

12:58.911 --> 13:01.848
I no longer feel like
I am in the front of the pack.

13:01.848 --> 13:05.618
So at this point I have to
push myself back to the front.

13:05.618 --> 13:07.120
Like, I have to.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.355
I do not wanna be
in the bottom again.

13:09.355 --> 13:10.923
-Oh, no, no.
-Like, I don't even wanna, like,

13:10.923 --> 13:12.792
have to, like,
consider that possibility.

13:12.792 --> 13:15.161
After all of what just happened,

13:15.161 --> 13:16.162
expectations are probably
out the window right now

13:16.162 --> 13:17.163
at this point.

13:17.163 --> 13:19.332
-Yeah.
-Yes.

13:19.332 --> 13:20.667
They want blood and--

13:20.667 --> 13:22.402
But pause.
No, no, no, pause.

13:22.402 --> 13:23.536
Sorry.

13:23.536 --> 13:24.604
Angeria, you look
so fucking beautiful.

13:24.604 --> 13:25.838
Your eye makeup tonight.

13:25.838 --> 13:27.106
As you're talking
and just looking like this,

13:27.106 --> 13:31.144
I'm just, like,
get the fuck outta here.

13:31.144 --> 13:32.245
Go ahead, Willow.

13:32.245 --> 13:34.914
Well, I'm glad Angeria
looks beautiful.

13:34.914 --> 13:36.683
[all laugh]
But I'm so happy

13:36.683 --> 13:40.319
that we made it through
the RuPaul's Lalacamooga--

13:40.319 --> 13:42.255
[all laugh]

13:42.255 --> 13:45.224
Lyrical dance competition.

13:45.224 --> 13:46.626
So let's get the fuck
outta drag.

13:46.626 --> 13:48.961
[cheering]

13:48.961 --> 13:51.497
-Cheers to that.
-Lalacamooga!

13:51.497 --> 13:53.032
-[laughs]
-Ugh!

13:53.032 --> 13:54.267
Oh!

13:54.267 --> 13:56.969
RuPaul: Welcome back
to the final round

13:56.969 --> 14:00.640
of our Lip Sync
Lalaparuza Smackdown.

14:00.640 --> 14:05.978
Bosco, Jasmine,
the time has come

14:05.978 --> 14:11.884
for you to lip sync
for your life!

14:11.884 --> 14:15.855
Bosco, shantay you stay.

14:15.855 --> 14:20.860
Jasmine Kennedie, sashay away.

14:24.163 --> 14:26.966
This has been a dream.

14:26.966 --> 14:29.602
This has been the biggest
experience I've ever had,

14:29.602 --> 14:31.537
and the most amazing
experience I have.

14:31.537 --> 14:33.806
I would not change it
for a thing.

14:33.806 --> 14:36.309
It changed my life forever,

14:36.309 --> 14:38.311
and it will be continuing
to change my life

14:38.311 --> 14:40.613
for the rest of my life.

14:42.315 --> 14:43.916
Mm.

14:45.318 --> 14:46.853
Aw.

14:46.853 --> 14:48.221
Nobody cleaned up?

14:48.221 --> 14:51.090
Mm, messy girls.

14:51.090 --> 14:53.392
Aw, I have notes.

14:53.392 --> 14:54.994
Love that.

14:54.994 --> 14:57.830
I don't wanna cry yet, but
I'm gonna start with Jorgeous.

14:57.830 --> 15:02.702
"Jasmine, I miss you
so very much already.

15:02.702 --> 15:04.203
"I really--" oh, God.

15:04.203 --> 15:06.539
"I really wish
you were still here.

15:06.539 --> 15:08.808
"You were one
of my biggest sisters,

15:08.808 --> 15:12.912
"and I'm so incredibly happy
I've met you.

15:12.912 --> 15:15.581
"Thank you for being
a huge light for me,

15:15.581 --> 15:17.250
and I'm gonna miss you so much."

15:17.250 --> 15:20.653
Oh! [cries]

15:20.653 --> 15:25.358
This is my Angie-poo.

15:25.358 --> 15:27.727
"You're my little sister
for life.

15:27.727 --> 15:32.298
"You will be a beautiful woman.

15:32.298 --> 15:34.300
"Thank you for uplifting me

15:34.300 --> 15:36.836
through this
tough-ass experience."

15:36.836 --> 15:38.738
I love you, Angie.

15:40.773 --> 15:43.743
I love my girls so much.

15:46.078 --> 15:49.448
Angie, she's made me feel
so confident

15:49.448 --> 15:52.618
about where I'm at
right now in my life,

15:52.618 --> 15:54.620
and Jorgeous is just, like--

15:54.620 --> 15:56.989
Jorgeous is, like,
my little, like, sister.

15:56.989 --> 15:59.458
And, like, we've had to
go through the same fights,

15:59.458 --> 16:02.728
and I'm just so happy
she's still in this,

16:02.728 --> 16:06.098
because I want her to win it
for all the girls

16:06.098 --> 16:09.435
that start drag
at, like, 15 or 16,

16:09.435 --> 16:12.305
because it's so hard.

16:12.305 --> 16:17.410
But these girls are my rock.

16:19.645 --> 16:23.950
I didn't think I would get
as close of a sisterhood

16:23.950 --> 16:27.053
as to, like, some of the girls,
like Angie, DeJa, and Jorgeous.

16:27.053 --> 16:28.821
Also, I did not expect

16:28.821 --> 16:32.291
coming out about my identity
as a trans woman.

16:32.291 --> 16:34.660
The emotions and then
the pressure cooker,

16:34.660 --> 16:37.997
it kind of just
was the release I needed,

16:37.997 --> 16:39.498
and if I didn't talk about it,

16:39.498 --> 16:40.967
I probably would have
gone home sooner,

16:40.967 --> 16:42.535
just because it would have been

16:42.535 --> 16:44.537
eating at my brain
more and more.

16:44.537 --> 16:49.275
I'm really happy that
I had Kerri to support me,

16:49.275 --> 16:51.611
because if she did not
talk to me about it,

16:51.611 --> 16:54.180
it would have not been
a good situation for me,

16:54.180 --> 16:55.314
that's for sure.

16:55.314 --> 16:58.017
Oh, my God, I mean,
what's next for me?

16:58.017 --> 17:00.586
I mean, I'm definitely
going to therapy,

17:00.586 --> 17:03.256
definitely gonna
start my transition.

17:03.256 --> 17:09.462
I never expected
I would have gotten this far.

17:09.462 --> 17:12.465
Me at 22,
dropping out of college,

17:12.465 --> 17:15.935
and getting to do this all
is unbelievable.

17:15.935 --> 17:17.003
Like, I can't complain.

17:17.003 --> 17:18.437
I don't care what anybody says,

17:18.437 --> 17:21.440
I hold the record
for most lip syncs of my life

17:21.440 --> 17:22.608
and surviving them.

17:22.608 --> 17:24.844
Ain't that a thing?
Okay, I'll take that.

17:24.844 --> 17:27.146
I will take that home proudly.

17:30.116 --> 17:34.687
I learned that I do sometimes
overdrive a conversation

17:34.687 --> 17:36.956
where I don't
let other people speak.

17:36.956 --> 17:39.492
I don't necessarily think
that's a bad thing,

17:39.492 --> 17:41.594
because sometimes people are
just talking out of their asses.

17:41.594 --> 17:43.262
[laughs]

17:43.262 --> 17:45.531
My finale gown.

17:45.531 --> 17:49.101
RuPaul, the fact that
you saw something in me

17:49.101 --> 17:52.471
is, like, the biggest dream
I could have ever had.

17:52.471 --> 17:54.607
And, like, I finally feel

17:54.607 --> 17:57.276
like I graduated
from, like, drag college,

17:57.276 --> 18:00.579
and, like, she gave me
my little diploma today,

18:00.579 --> 18:02.315
even though I didn't win.

18:02.315 --> 18:03.816
But I can go out there knowing

18:03.816 --> 18:06.519
that, like, I've achieved
what I wanted to.

18:06.519 --> 18:09.121
So thank you to the moon
and back, RuPaul.

18:09.121 --> 18:10.856
I will forever be thankful.

18:15.795 --> 18:17.630
I made it.
That's all I can say.

18:17.630 --> 18:19.231
I made it to Drag Race,

18:19.231 --> 18:21.968
and I can't ask
for anything else.

18:21.968 --> 18:25.838
Well...

18:25.838 --> 18:29.175
I'll miss you girls.

18:29.175 --> 18:31.410
Hopefully you'll still hear me.

18:31.410 --> 18:35.448
My voice travels
all the way from New York.

18:37.216 --> 18:39.352
I've grown a confidence
in myself

18:39.352 --> 18:41.721
that I never knew I could have.

18:41.721 --> 18:43.055
I've grown so much.

18:43.055 --> 18:45.958
I feel just so happy
and content.

18:47.927 --> 18:50.863
And I think that
all of the effort

18:50.863 --> 18:52.698
has actually paid off finally.

18:52.698 --> 18:54.934
I have no regrets.

18:54.934 --> 18:58.804
Well, listen,

18:58.804 --> 19:01.240
make sure your dreams,
whatever they are,

19:01.240 --> 19:03.509
you push them to the fullest.

19:03.509 --> 19:04.944
Be your biggest hero,

19:04.944 --> 19:07.179
because sometimes you're the
only one rooting for yourself.

19:07.179 --> 19:08.514
Love you.

19:09.882 --> 19:14.186
Let's hit it.

19:14.186 --> 19:15.688
Bye!
