18:50.363 --> 18:51.598
Okay.

19:01.608 --> 19:04.577
As far as my love life goes,
the night was a bust.

19:04.611 --> 19:07.447
But I did make some
new friends, and I'm alive.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.649
So, I guess it wasn't
a total loss.

19:09.682 --> 19:11.318
Your tenant, Adam.

19:11.351 --> 19:13.620
P.P.S. -- you've got
a serious insect problem

19:13.653 --> 19:15.388
inside your kitchen cupboard.

19:15.422 --> 19:16.656
There were too many to count.

19:26.266 --> 19:27.500
[ Knocking ]

19:32.505 --> 19:34.241
Who is it?

19:34.274 --> 19:35.775
It's Abby.

19:35.808 --> 19:38.445
I'm here for the party.

19:38.478 --> 19:39.846
Hi.

19:39.879 --> 19:41.314
I know I'm kind of late.

19:41.348 --> 19:43.383
I got an Evite
about a week ago.

19:43.416 --> 19:44.717
I thought it might be
a mistake,

19:44.751 --> 19:46.353
but my e-mail address
is so strange,

19:46.386 --> 19:47.587
I don't know how
that could happen.

19:47.620 --> 19:50.457
SnickerdoodleLover4326389.

19:50.490 --> 19:52.592
The number signifies how many
snickerdoodle cookies

19:52.625 --> 19:55.328
I think it would take to ease
tensions in the Middle East.

19:55.362 --> 19:57.697
Anyway, I was sitting
at home tonight, doing nothing,

19:57.730 --> 19:59.832
as always, and I thought,
"What the heck?

19:59.866 --> 20:01.701
Maybe I should go
to that party."

20:01.734 --> 20:04.571
But I just couldn't muster up
the nerve to walk to my car.

20:04.604 --> 20:07.374
So, I made a deal with myself
that if I saw a commercial

20:07.407 --> 20:08.975
for that egg-shaped
cheese grater thing

20:09.008 --> 20:11.010
that you use to get
the dead skin off your feet,

20:11.043 --> 20:13.580
that would be a sign
I should get in my car and go.

20:13.613 --> 20:16.516
And wouldn't you know, halfway
through "How I Met Your Mother,"

20:16.549 --> 20:17.984
there it was...

20:18.017 --> 20:19.952
that silly foot egg.

20:19.986 --> 20:22.755
So...here I am.

20:24.924 --> 20:26.359
Party's over.

20:29.529 --> 20:30.830
What a weirdo.

20:30.863 --> 20:32.932
* Show me the best
that you got *

20:32.965 --> 20:38.271
* And I'll show you one better

20:38.305 --> 20:40.407
* Tell me a dirty joke

20:40.440 --> 20:44.944
* And I'll laugh it off
lightly *

20:44.977 --> 20:47.614
* If I tell you a dirty joke

20:47.647 --> 20:52.719
* You might not like me

20:52.752 --> 20:57.457
* Everyone gets
to make one big mistake *

20:59.526 --> 21:01.461
* And if you're waiting on me

21:01.494 --> 21:04.697
* Well, I guess you
gonna have to wait *

21:09.969 --> 21:11.871
Tommy!

21:11.904 --> 21:13.706
Oh, baby, look!

21:13.740 --> 21:15.408
Look at these cabins
they got up here.

21:15.442 --> 21:16.876
Honey, we should rent one.

21:16.909 --> 21:19.412
I don't want to sleep
in the El Camino.

21:19.446 --> 21:21.047
I don't have a lot of cash.

21:21.080 --> 21:22.715
We don't need cash, baby.

21:22.749 --> 21:25.051
I still got all these
stolen credit cards, okay?

21:25.084 --> 21:28.020
You gotta do it, though, 'cause
they all got boys names on them.

21:28.054 --> 21:30.056
I'll meet you
in the car, okay?

21:30.089 --> 21:32.024
Uh, but I already
got two strikes.

21:32.058 --> 21:33.626
Don't be a pussy.

21:35.495 --> 21:40.567
* Everyone gets to make
one big mistake *
