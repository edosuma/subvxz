WEBVTT

00:01.468 --> 00:03.271
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 There you are.
 Last we left our Jane,

00:03.304 --> 00:05.273
her fiancé Michael
 had lost his job

00:05.306 --> 00:07.375
due to a little, uh,
 bad publicity,

00:07.408 --> 00:08.776
so Jane picked up
 some extra work

00:08.809 --> 00:10.578
writing other
 people's college essays.

00:10.611 --> 00:12.046
And I'm the one paying you

00:12.080 --> 00:13.547
to write the essay
to get him in.

00:13.581 --> 00:14.648
But her conscience got

00:14.682 --> 00:16.283
the better of her, so she quit.

00:16.317 --> 00:18.519
Unfortunately,
 Petra's twin sister, Anezka,

00:18.552 --> 00:19.587
who is epileptic...

00:19.620 --> 00:20.888
Oh.
Leaping lizards!

00:20.921 --> 00:23.657
I forgot to mention, Petra has
 a twin sister named Anezka.

00:23.691 --> 00:26.527
What the...
 Anyway, Anezka thought
 she was being helpful.

00:26.560 --> 00:28.062
Well, I not thinking

00:28.096 --> 00:29.830
Jane is perfect, not at all.

00:29.863 --> 00:31.299
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And so, she sabotaged Jane.

00:31.332 --> 00:33.401
I know! Leaping lizards,
 indeed.

00:33.434 --> 00:35.536
Oh, and speaking
 of shady relatives,

00:35.569 --> 00:37.071
you'll recall Rafael's mother

00:37.105 --> 00:38.439
was the crime lord
 known as Mutter.

00:38.472 --> 00:40.708
Oh, and his long lost
 brother showed up.

00:40.741 --> 00:43.344
Did you know our mother
was a crime lord?
No, did you?

00:43.377 --> 00:44.545
RAFAEL: Where were you?
 You weren't with our mother.

00:44.578 --> 00:46.547
Right here, on this boat.

00:46.580 --> 00:48.316
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Unfortunately, Derek

00:48.349 --> 00:49.750
seemed to be up to
 a little sabotage of his own.

00:49.783 --> 00:51.752
It's a go. Let's take him down.

00:51.785 --> 00:54.155
I know, straight out
 of a telenovela, right?

00:54.188 --> 00:56.490
Which brings us to Rogelio,
 who started sleeping with

00:56.524 --> 00:58.759
the head writer of his show.
XIOMARA:
 I think you like her a lot.

00:58.792 --> 01:00.361
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Which was a challenge for Xo,

01:00.394 --> 01:01.862
but Rogelio promised
 she could still record

01:01.895 --> 01:03.397
a song for his show,

01:03.431 --> 01:04.831
and speaking
 of big productions,

01:04.864 --> 01:06.334
we are T-minus 17 days

01:06.367 --> 01:08.169
before Jane
 and Michael's wedding,

01:08.202 --> 01:10.404
so let's hop on it.

01:10.438 --> 01:15.843
Jane Gloriana Villanueva didn't
 remember her first Mother's Day

01:15.876 --> 01:18.179
because she was
 a baby at the time.

01:19.880 --> 01:21.382
Happy Mother's Day!

01:21.415 --> 01:23.817
Come, come, I have

01:23.851 --> 01:25.219
a surprise for you.

01:27.455 --> 01:28.622
Today, we're

01:28.656 --> 01:29.690
going to do nothing

01:29.723 --> 01:31.159
but sit in our pj's,

01:31.192 --> 01:32.226
watch the marathon of

01:32.260 --> 01:33.661
Lagrimas de tu Corazon

01:33.694 --> 01:36.430
on channel five, and eat
all the ice cream we want.

01:40.201 --> 01:41.502
Come on, aren't you dying

01:41.535 --> 01:42.903
to find out
if Eva's secret twin

01:42.936 --> 01:44.338
is working with Alfonso

01:44.372 --> 01:46.274
to bring down
the Ramirez empire?

01:46.307 --> 01:47.408
Hmm.

01:47.441 --> 01:49.177
Please?

01:49.210 --> 01:51.179
It's my first
Mother's Day as a mother,

01:51.212 --> 01:53.581
and I want to spend
it with my mom.

01:53.614 --> 01:55.916
Chunky Monkey?

01:55.949 --> 01:57.651
Two pints.

01:57.685 --> 01:58.719
(chuckles)

01:58.752 --> 02:00.421
And so a tradition was born.

02:00.454 --> 02:04.458
Observe: binge watching,
 before streaming.

02:04.492 --> 02:06.394
Yes, it was a thing.

02:08.795 --> 02:11.865
Over the years,
 the format changed,

02:11.899 --> 02:15.536
but the fundamentals were
 the same: a day of pj's,

02:15.569 --> 02:17.505
pints and telenovelas.

02:17.538 --> 02:18.672
Ay!

02:18.706 --> 02:21.242
It was Juan
Carlos's twin?!

02:22.276 --> 02:24.645
Ricardo has a twin brother?

02:24.678 --> 02:26.280
Don't act so surprised, Jane.

02:26.314 --> 02:28.249
It's a well-worn trope
 of the genre...

02:28.282 --> 02:30.384
I did not see that coming.

02:30.418 --> 02:32.653
...but it still works
 every time,

02:32.686 --> 02:34.788
and Jane was planning
 on spending her first

02:34.822 --> 02:36.790
Mother's Day as a mother
 carrying on the tradition.

02:36.824 --> 02:38.792
(sighs)
I'm torn.

02:38.826 --> 02:41.662
Do we revisit a classic
like Lagrimas

02:41.695 --> 02:42.830
de tu Corazon,

02:42.863 --> 02:45.699
or do we binge this
new one from Mexico,

02:45.733 --> 02:46.834
La Danza

02:46.867 --> 02:47.835
de los Criminales.

02:49.570 --> 02:51.405
But then...

02:51.439 --> 02:52.706
Oh.

02:59.713 --> 03:00.681
Petra.

03:00.714 --> 03:02.550
Oh, hi, Jane.

03:02.583 --> 03:03.651
What's this?

03:03.684 --> 03:04.552
Oh, nothing.

03:04.585 --> 03:06.287
Oh, well, I-I just
thought it would be

03:06.320 --> 03:07.888
simpler if, um, if we all
did something together,

03:07.921 --> 03:09.557
so Rafael wouldn't have to

03:09.590 --> 03:10.358
split his time.

03:10.391 --> 03:12.226
You're hosting
a Mother's Day brunch?

03:12.260 --> 03:14.328
Oh, it's not a big deal.

03:15.363 --> 03:16.797
You made cards.

03:16.830 --> 03:18.366
Yeah, K-Krishna
got carried away.

03:18.399 --> 03:21.969
Um, anyway, your-your
whole family's invited.

03:22.002 --> 03:23.771
If you want.

03:26.039 --> 03:27.741
You don't have to come.

03:27.775 --> 03:29.477
We'd love to, Petra.
Thank you.

03:37.985 --> 03:39.253
MICHAEL:
 You really said yes?

03:39.287 --> 03:40.388
Of course, I said yes.

03:40.421 --> 03:41.589
But I just finished setting up

03:41.622 --> 03:42.790
the TV for your binge watch.

03:42.823 --> 03:44.024
Oh, well, guess we have

03:44.057 --> 03:45.526
to call Petra and cancel.

03:45.559 --> 03:47.595
Stop, she's making
a real effort here.

03:47.628 --> 03:48.662
It's sweet,

03:48.696 --> 03:49.897
and we're...

03:49.930 --> 03:50.998
sort of a family...

03:51.031 --> 03:52.533
it's important to show up.

03:52.566 --> 03:53.634
Right, Abuela?

03:56.637 --> 03:57.671
Well, tough.

03:57.705 --> 03:59.006
We're all going.

03:59.039 --> 04:00.908
Got it. I should run.

04:00.941 --> 04:02.676
Can't be late for
my first day at the new job.

04:02.710 --> 04:03.711
(Jane chuckles)

04:03.744 --> 04:04.812
Pretty sure your boss

04:04.845 --> 04:06.747
will cut you some slack.

04:06.780 --> 04:09.650
True, for the record,
 since his new boss was...

04:22.396 --> 04:24.598
(clears throat)

04:48.522 --> 04:49.723
Okay, guys, come on.

04:49.757 --> 04:50.758
Let's keep it friendly
for the EPK.

04:55.563 --> 04:57.531
Yes, Rogelio,

04:57.565 --> 04:59.467
let's not turn this
into a pissing contest.

04:59.500 --> 05:00.868
I understand why you'd be

05:00.901 --> 05:02.470
intimidated, I have
a very propulsive stream.

05:02.503 --> 05:03.471
All right,

05:03.504 --> 05:04.538
let's take five.

05:04.572 --> 05:05.706
(bell ringing)

05:05.739 --> 05:06.807
Michael, please.

05:06.840 --> 05:07.875
Uh, I don't think you've

05:07.908 --> 05:09.477
met my new head
of security.

05:09.510 --> 05:10.544
This is

05:10.578 --> 05:11.812
Michael Cordero,

05:11.845 --> 05:14.682
former star detective
of the Miami PD.

05:14.715 --> 05:15.716
Ah. (chuckles)

05:15.749 --> 05:16.717
Nice to meet you.

05:16.750 --> 05:18.586
I had to beef
up protection

05:18.619 --> 05:21.121
due to my well-publicized
stalking incident.

05:21.154 --> 05:23.424
Have you ever
been stalked, Esteban?

05:23.457 --> 05:25.359
So many times.

05:25.393 --> 05:27.895
Funny, I don't recall
anything high-profile.

05:27.928 --> 05:29.029
I kept it out of the press,

05:29.062 --> 05:30.864
but I did "beef up"

05:30.898 --> 05:33.601
my personal security, as well.

05:35.869 --> 05:36.870
This is Donny,

05:36.904 --> 05:37.905
former world champion

05:37.938 --> 05:39.139
of the MMA circuit.

05:39.172 --> 05:40.874
Donny,

05:40.908 --> 05:42.009
please carry me
to craft service.

05:47.881 --> 05:48.782
He's so ridiculous.

05:48.816 --> 05:50.684
Can you carry me?

05:51.952 --> 05:53.854
No. (sputtering)

05:53.887 --> 05:54.755
I'm kidding.

05:54.788 --> 05:56.457
I'm kidding, of course.

05:56.490 --> 05:58.726
Come, let me tell
you all about the big

05:58.759 --> 06:00.494
Mother's Day surprise
I am planning for Jane.

06:00.528 --> 06:01.795
Oh, okay, just remember,

06:01.829 --> 06:03.464
Jane doesn't
love surprises.

06:03.497 --> 06:04.832
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 True, for the record.

06:04.865 --> 06:06.434
And unfortunately,

06:06.467 --> 06:08.436
she was about to get a big one.

06:08.469 --> 06:09.803
Sorry, but your
phone's been blowing up

06:09.837 --> 06:11.038
for the last 30 minutes.

06:11.071 --> 06:12.440
A lot of unknown numbers.

06:12.473 --> 06:13.907
12 messages? That's bizarre.

06:18.546 --> 06:19.980
What is it?

06:20.013 --> 06:22.916
Someone wants to pay me to
write their college term paper.

06:24.852 --> 06:26.620
And another one.

06:26.654 --> 06:28.756
BOY'S VOICE:
Hey, I'm replying to the ad
in University Daily

06:28.789 --> 06:31.425
about how I can pay you
to write my essays.

06:31.459 --> 06:32.926
And I have this Earth Science
thing coming up...

06:32.960 --> 06:33.994
(gasps)

06:34.027 --> 06:36.163
Oh, my God.

06:36.196 --> 06:37.965
Oh, my God.

06:37.998 --> 06:40.100
"Jane Villanueva will write

06:40.133 --> 06:43.036
your college essay for money?"

06:43.070 --> 06:44.738
Who did this?

06:44.772 --> 06:46.073
What's going on?

06:46.106 --> 06:47.675
...call me back.
We'll talk prices.

06:47.708 --> 06:49.042
(phone beeps)
Oh, no, my advisor called.

06:49.076 --> 06:50.711
Hi, Jane...

06:50.744 --> 06:52.112
Please, please, please don't be
about the advertisement.

06:52.145 --> 06:54.548
There was an advertisement
that Professor Blake and I

06:54.582 --> 06:57.718
need to speak with you about
as soon as possible.

06:57.751 --> 06:59.587
Okay. It's okay.

06:59.620 --> 07:02.823
She hates me,
but Blake mostly doesn't.

07:02.856 --> 07:04.458
Professor Blake,
Professor Donaldson

07:06.694 --> 07:07.595
I just want to assure you,

07:07.628 --> 07:09.630
I do not write college
papers for money.

07:09.663 --> 07:12.666
I am clearly 100%
against cheating.

07:12.700 --> 07:15.035
Then why is there an ad in the
paper offering your services?

07:15.068 --> 07:16.470
I have no idea.

07:16.504 --> 07:18.639
It's obviously
some sort of prank.

07:18.672 --> 07:20.941
I mean, even if I did
write papers for money,

07:20.974 --> 07:23.010
which, again, I don't,

07:23.043 --> 07:24.812
would I ever advertise
in the school paper?

07:24.845 --> 07:26.880
She's right, Richard.

07:26.914 --> 07:28.916
Why would she do this?
She's not stupid.

07:28.949 --> 07:31.785
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Aw, she called Jane not stupid.

07:31.819 --> 07:33.787
So who do you think did it?

07:33.821 --> 07:35.523
I have no idea.

07:35.556 --> 07:36.824
But I promise I'm going to get

07:36.857 --> 07:38.559
to the bottom of this.
Here's the thing,

07:38.592 --> 07:40.661
regardless of whether or not
you placed the ad...

07:40.694 --> 07:42.029
I definitely didn't.

07:42.062 --> 07:43.130
...drama just seems
to follow you.

07:45.065 --> 07:47.535
(people gasping)
No! Oh! Wait!

07:47.568 --> 07:49.036
I'm sorry, you can finish out
your current class,

07:49.069 --> 07:51.505
but I can't have you back
to TA next semester.

07:51.539 --> 07:53.173
Really, Richard?

07:53.206 --> 07:54.942
RICHARD;
Yes.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.544
JANE: I'm telling you,
 Donaldson's my only hope.

07:56.577 --> 07:58.078
I think if I can prove to her

07:58.111 --> 07:59.647
that I was set up,
she'll help me.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.549
So, I went to
the school paper

08:01.582 --> 08:02.716
and got the buyer's
e-mail address.

08:02.750 --> 08:05.553
JaneVillanueva1234@hotmail.com

08:05.586 --> 08:07.020
Creepy.

08:07.054 --> 08:09.990
So, I just set up my own fake
e-mail account,

08:10.023 --> 08:11.559
and pretended to be
from the school,

08:11.592 --> 08:13.260
and asked if they
wanted to rerun the ad.

08:13.293 --> 08:14.662
Ooh, nice.

08:14.695 --> 08:16.664
Very Jessica Jones.

08:16.697 --> 08:17.965
Thank you.

08:17.998 --> 08:19.867
I just, I need to prove to
Professor Blake

08:19.900 --> 08:21.268
that this was a mistake.

08:21.301 --> 08:22.870
And that drama
doesn't follow me.

08:22.903 --> 08:24.004
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 In Jane's defense,

08:24.037 --> 08:25.138
drama is in her blood.

08:25.172 --> 08:30.644
We have reached Sting-tantric
levels of love-making.

08:30.678 --> 08:31.812
Add it to your special skills.

08:31.845 --> 08:33.046
Done.

08:38.586 --> 08:39.919
Why are you hurrying off?

08:39.953 --> 08:41.722
Work.
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Ah, yes.

08:41.755 --> 08:44.291
You'll recall,
 Rogelio's booty call

08:44.324 --> 08:46.193
had recently turned
 into a full-blown crush.

08:46.226 --> 08:47.928
Where'd I put my phone?
Um...

08:49.162 --> 08:50.330
Hmm.

08:50.363 --> 08:52.232
(clears throat)

08:54.334 --> 08:55.703
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Don't worry, Ro.

08:55.736 --> 08:57.337
That could totally be
 an oversight.

08:57.370 --> 08:59.873
Here it is.

08:59.907 --> 09:02.275
So, uh, Dina,

09:02.309 --> 09:03.744
what are you doing Saturday?

09:03.777 --> 09:07.014
I have plans.

09:07.047 --> 09:08.215
RAFAEL: They're just
the preliminary plans,

09:08.248 --> 09:09.282
of course.

09:09.316 --> 09:10.718
I'm impressed.

09:10.751 --> 09:12.252
Your architect did
a spectacular job.

09:12.285 --> 09:14.955
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 As my grandmother used to say,

09:14.988 --> 09:16.590
"Ay, not this guy."

09:16.624 --> 09:17.758
I'm glad you're both happy.

09:17.791 --> 09:18.826
Very happy.

09:18.859 --> 09:20.027
Call the firm,

09:20.060 --> 09:21.328
tell them we're moving forward.

09:26.767 --> 09:27.901
Petra?

09:27.935 --> 09:29.770
What's this?

09:29.803 --> 09:32.039
Why does everyone keep asking
that? Read the invitation.

09:32.072 --> 09:33.607
That's the whole point
of an invitation.

09:33.641 --> 09:35.142
You're throwing
a Mother's Day brunch?

09:35.175 --> 09:37.010
Yes.

09:37.044 --> 09:38.045
Jane's family's coming.

09:38.078 --> 09:39.913
I just thought it would be
easier for everyone

09:39.947 --> 09:41.148
if we're all in one place.

09:41.181 --> 09:42.049
Really?

09:42.082 --> 09:43.183
Don't make it into a thing.

09:43.216 --> 09:44.317
Yeah, well, there is one thing.

09:44.351 --> 09:45.619
Invitation says 11:00.

09:46.787 --> 09:47.988
The twins are
still napping then.

09:48.021 --> 09:49.890
Oh.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.324
So we'll wake them up.

09:51.358 --> 09:53.661
We've worked really hard
to get them on a schedule.

09:53.694 --> 09:55.796
Okay, fine, so we'll
push the brunch to 1:00.

09:55.829 --> 09:57.064
Now it's a lunch.

09:58.231 --> 09:59.833
Enjoy.

10:01.434 --> 10:02.803
Yes!

10:02.836 --> 10:03.871
What?

10:03.904 --> 10:05.873
I got a response
from my fake e-mail.

10:05.906 --> 10:07.675
"No thank you to renewing
advertisement,

10:07.708 --> 10:09.409
I have everything
what is necessary."

10:09.442 --> 10:12.746
"Everything what is necessary"?

10:12.780 --> 10:14.347
Jane! Sorry to interrupt.

10:14.381 --> 10:16.684
Uh, we're gonna have to
bump the brunch to 1:00.

10:16.717 --> 10:18.652
I forgot the twins nap at 11:00.

10:20.387 --> 10:21.755
What?
Nothing.

10:21.789 --> 10:23.691
They just changed
their schedule.

10:23.724 --> 10:24.892
Anyway, is that all right?

10:24.925 --> 10:27.060
Yes, of course.
No problem.

10:27.094 --> 10:29.229
I know, Abuela, I'm sorry,

10:29.262 --> 10:32.966
but she got the nap times wrong,
I guess.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.903
Come on, you know Petra's
not a hands-on mom,

10:35.936 --> 10:38.105
give her a break please.

10:38.138 --> 10:40.140
Can you get someone to cover
your shift?

10:42.075 --> 10:43.777
That is sounding important.

10:43.811 --> 10:44.912
If you wanting to talk,

10:44.945 --> 10:46.313
I can do everything
what is necessary

10:46.346 --> 10:47.948
to cover your tables.

10:47.981 --> 10:49.316
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Did she just say...

10:49.349 --> 10:50.718
I have to call you back.

10:50.751 --> 10:51.919
Excuse me?

10:51.952 --> 10:53.386
I say,

10:53.420 --> 10:57.190
I can do everything what
is necessary for your tables.

10:57.224 --> 10:58.926
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And that's when Jane realized

10:58.959 --> 11:00.360
what she should have
 realized much earlier,

11:00.393 --> 11:02.162
given her great love
 of telenovelas,

11:02.195 --> 11:04.297
it's always the twin.

11:12.372 --> 11:14.842
Petra?
Oh, hey, perfect timing.

11:14.875 --> 11:15.943
Here's our caterer's

11:15.976 --> 11:16.977
proposed menu for our lunch.

11:17.010 --> 11:18.879
Any allergies?

11:18.912 --> 11:19.947
Issues?

11:19.980 --> 11:21.381
Wow! Four courses.

11:21.414 --> 11:22.415
I'm assuming

11:22.449 --> 11:24.017
each course lasts three minutes

11:24.051 --> 11:25.485
and has lots of Cheerios

11:25.518 --> 11:27.721
or Mateo's not gonna make it.

11:27.755 --> 11:29.422
I didn't realize
I had to prepare

11:29.456 --> 11:30.758
something special for Mateo.

11:30.791 --> 11:32.092
No, I'm kidding.
I'm--

11:32.125 --> 11:33.293
I'm-I'm just saying
that he can't

11:33.326 --> 11:34.962
sit through four courses.

11:34.995 --> 11:36.263
Well, my nannies will be there
if he gets fussy.

11:36.296 --> 11:37.998
Oh, I mean, well,

11:38.031 --> 11:40.100
it is Mother's Day,
so I do want to be with him.

11:40.133 --> 11:42.102
I wasn't suggesting you don't
want to be with him.

11:42.135 --> 11:43.236
Okay, we're getting off track.
That is great.

11:43.270 --> 11:45.973
Um... I actually

11:46.006 --> 11:47.741
wanted to talk about Anezka.

11:47.775 --> 11:50.010
I've showed her
how to use deodorant.

11:50.043 --> 11:51.979
No, it-it's not that.
It's, um...

11:52.012 --> 11:53.413
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And so, Jane told Petra

11:53.446 --> 11:55.315
about... well, you know.

11:55.348 --> 11:56.383
Let's FF through.

11:56.416 --> 11:57.584
(Jane speaking rapidly)

12:01.454 --> 12:02.790
But why would she do that?

12:02.823 --> 12:04.424
I have no idea.

12:04.457 --> 12:05.926
But in order to get
my TA job back,

12:05.959 --> 12:07.227
I have to prove who it was,

12:07.260 --> 12:09.863
and I really think
it was your sister.

12:11.131 --> 12:12.365
Let me talk to her.

12:12.399 --> 12:13.967
(exhales)

12:14.001 --> 12:15.335
ROGELIO:
 I need to talk to you.

12:15.368 --> 12:17.437
I wasn't going to mention it,

12:17.470 --> 12:19.372
but holding in my emotions

12:19.406 --> 12:20.941
is causing me to
eat my feelings.

12:20.974 --> 12:22.843
And I think we can both agree

12:22.876 --> 12:24.477
that will be a disaster
for the ratings.

12:24.511 --> 12:26.546
What is it?

12:26.579 --> 12:29.316
I know you're having
a birthday party.

12:29.349 --> 12:30.951
And I was not invited.

12:30.984 --> 12:33.120
(sighs) Look.

12:33.153 --> 12:35.088
The truth is I don't think you'd

12:35.122 --> 12:37.157
get along with my other friends.

12:37.190 --> 12:40.060
They're more like,
you know, regular people.

12:40.093 --> 12:42.462
Some of my closest friends
are non-celebs.

12:42.495 --> 12:44.297
Stedman, for example.

12:44.331 --> 12:47.234
It's just you're interested
in different things.

12:47.267 --> 12:48.802
You like to talk
about the Kardashians.

12:48.836 --> 12:49.937
(chuckles)

12:49.970 --> 12:51.171
There more interested in

12:51.204 --> 12:52.272
Ta-Nehisi Coates.

12:52.305 --> 12:54.174
I assure you I'm open

12:54.207 --> 12:55.475
to all kinds of jackets.

12:55.508 --> 12:56.476
He's not a jacket.

12:56.509 --> 12:57.477
He's an author.

12:57.510 --> 12:59.079
I... know.

12:59.112 --> 13:00.147
I was just

13:00.180 --> 13:01.248
making a joke.

13:01.281 --> 13:02.315
Come on, Dina.

13:02.349 --> 13:03.516
I can totally hang with nerds.

13:03.550 --> 13:05.285
I spent a good part
of the summer of 1998

13:05.318 --> 13:07.187
hanging with Moby.

13:07.220 --> 13:08.989
Please.

13:09.022 --> 13:10.090
Let me come.

13:13.293 --> 13:14.561
Fantastic.

13:14.594 --> 13:16.163
And I promise
I will show your friends

13:16.196 --> 13:18.031
my intellectual side.

13:18.065 --> 13:21.034
Jane, I need you to give me
an intellectual side.

13:21.068 --> 13:23.904
So, you want to do a
whole Pygmalion thing?

13:23.937 --> 13:25.572
What? No, no, no.

13:25.605 --> 13:27.274
Like a My Fair Lady thing.

13:27.307 --> 13:30.477
See, Dina is seeing me
only as a sex object.

13:30.510 --> 13:33.046
And I have to prove to her
that I am more than just

13:33.080 --> 13:34.581
oceans of charisma.

13:34.614 --> 13:36.549
I refuse to be objectified.

13:36.583 --> 13:38.318
Make it a little
tighter, please.

13:38.351 --> 13:39.586
Don't you want
to be with somebody

13:39.619 --> 13:40.921
who respects you
for who you are?

13:40.954 --> 13:42.189
Yes, of course!

13:42.222 --> 13:43.223
I just want to present her

13:43.256 --> 13:44.424
with a smarter alternative.

13:44.457 --> 13:45.926
Please, Jane.

13:45.959 --> 13:47.928
Watch the pin!

13:47.961 --> 13:49.229
Okay, Dad, whatever you need.

13:49.262 --> 13:51.031
Ready to shoot?

13:51.064 --> 13:52.565
(gasps)

13:52.599 --> 13:54.467
Jane, I'm sorry.

13:54.501 --> 13:56.103
There's an emergency at work.

13:56.136 --> 13:57.604
I'm gonna have to call you back.

13:57.637 --> 13:58.571
(sighs)

13:58.605 --> 14:00.340
Dad wants to seem smarter,

14:00.373 --> 14:03.243
I guess, for Dina.

14:03.276 --> 14:04.912
Wow.

14:04.945 --> 14:06.146
He must like her a lot.

14:06.179 --> 14:08.315
Yeah.

14:08.348 --> 14:11.051
Are you okay with all of this?

14:11.084 --> 14:12.285
I'm fine.

14:12.319 --> 14:13.954
You should support your dad.

14:13.987 --> 14:14.988
(door opens)

14:16.423 --> 14:18.658
(both laugh)

14:18.691 --> 14:20.627
Don't laugh, don't laugh.

14:20.660 --> 14:22.963
Hey, my eyes are up here.
Look me in the eyes.

14:22.996 --> 14:25.165
Oh, I can't.
It's just so white!

14:25.198 --> 14:27.034
Oh, oh...
Oh, mm, okay.

14:27.067 --> 14:29.169
I'm okay.

14:29.202 --> 14:30.070
Uh-huh.

14:30.103 --> 14:31.304
How was your first day?

14:31.338 --> 14:33.006
It was great.

14:33.040 --> 14:35.442
Well, now you look me
in the eye.

14:35.475 --> 14:37.144
Okay, well,
maybe it wasn't as exciting

14:37.177 --> 14:38.311
as fighting
international crime lords.

14:38.345 --> 14:39.679
But I did give a warning

14:39.712 --> 14:41.214
to a guy who was about
to take four donuts

14:41.248 --> 14:42.449
from craft service,
so... (whistles)

14:42.482 --> 14:44.084
Ooh.
Mm-hmm, how about you?

14:44.117 --> 14:46.519
Did you solve the case
of the classified catfisher?

14:46.553 --> 14:48.155
I am a former detective.

14:48.188 --> 14:49.456
I can help you
track down the perp.

14:49.489 --> 14:51.458
Perp's been tracked.
Who is it?

14:51.491 --> 14:52.692
Finally, there you are.

14:52.725 --> 14:54.461
Did you have anything

14:54.494 --> 14:56.396
to do with this ad?

14:56.429 --> 14:58.498
Oh, yes, I did do.

14:58.531 --> 15:00.367
You are so very welcome.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.069
"Welcome"?

15:02.102 --> 15:04.204
Anezka, what were you thinking?

15:04.237 --> 15:07.140
Oh, you hint
for me to do it.

15:07.174 --> 15:09.142
Because Rafael was
thinking Jane too perfect.

15:09.176 --> 15:11.278
No, I didn't hint.

15:11.311 --> 15:13.280
Oh, no.

15:13.313 --> 15:15.282
I am so stupid then.

15:15.315 --> 15:16.216
Jane is my friend.

15:16.249 --> 15:18.351
Oh, well, no, she not be
such good friend.

15:18.385 --> 15:21.021
She's saying you
aren't good mother.

15:22.155 --> 15:24.024
Oh... forget it.

15:24.057 --> 15:25.658
I-I causing trouble enough.

15:25.692 --> 15:27.094
What?

15:27.127 --> 15:28.962
Anezka?

15:28.996 --> 15:30.430
What did Jane say?

15:30.463 --> 15:32.032
So, let's review
from the top.

15:32.065 --> 15:33.366
The three main topics

15:33.400 --> 15:36.436
of intellectual party
conversation are?

15:36.469 --> 15:37.704
Current events,

15:37.737 --> 15:39.706
literature, culture.

15:39.739 --> 15:41.975
Kardashians?
Mm.

15:42.009 --> 15:43.310
Off limits.

15:43.343 --> 15:44.978
Mmm.

15:45.012 --> 15:46.313
But there's so much
to discuss!

15:46.346 --> 15:48.381
Kourtney's going
through hell with Scott!

15:48.415 --> 15:49.983
The--
Dad.

15:50.017 --> 15:51.718
Okay, so we've covered
 The Goldfinch,

15:51.751 --> 15:54.654
the election--
last handout.

15:54.687 --> 15:57.024
If they're talking museums,
bust out this info

15:57.057 --> 15:59.059
on Marina Abramovic.

15:59.092 --> 16:01.728
Very current,
super pretentious.

16:01.761 --> 16:04.331
She just stares at people
for hours at a time?

16:04.364 --> 16:04.897
Mm-hmm.
That's not art.

16:04.931 --> 16:06.066
That's just bad manners.

16:06.099 --> 16:07.167
Good!

16:07.200 --> 16:08.368
That's a legitimate critique!

16:08.401 --> 16:09.469
(grunts twice)

16:09.502 --> 16:10.503
And remember, if you feel like

16:10.537 --> 16:12.039
you're in over your head,

16:12.072 --> 16:13.040
just excuse yourself to go to

16:13.073 --> 16:14.307
the bathroom or get a drink.

16:14.341 --> 16:16.109
Return to a new group
and start over.

16:16.143 --> 16:17.444
Thank you, Jane.
Mm-hmm.

16:17.477 --> 16:18.711
I will learn my lines,

16:18.745 --> 16:21.181
and give a Paloma-worthy
performance.

16:21.214 --> 16:22.582
I'm sure you will.

16:22.615 --> 16:24.184
Yes.

16:24.217 --> 16:26.186
So, is Michael
liking the new job?

16:26.219 --> 16:27.454
So fun, right?

16:27.487 --> 16:29.522
Oh, yeah, so fun.

16:29.556 --> 16:31.458
Is he not having
an excellent time?

16:31.491 --> 16:35.195
He's really grateful
to you for the job.

16:35.228 --> 16:37.530
DEREK:
 And I'm grateful

16:37.564 --> 16:39.466
that you gave me this job.
I really am.

16:39.499 --> 16:42.069
But I've got to resign.

16:42.102 --> 16:43.203
Wait, what?

16:43.236 --> 16:44.737
Why?

16:44.771 --> 16:48.275
I've decided to go
into the hotel business myself.

16:48.308 --> 16:50.743
In fact...

16:50.777 --> 16:52.745
you're gonna give me
the Fairwick.

16:52.779 --> 16:54.714
(chuckles)

16:56.249 --> 16:57.417
Wait, is this some kind of joke?

16:58.651 --> 17:00.253
You know what's a joke?

17:00.287 --> 17:02.789
You pretending to be
some great long-lost big brother

17:02.822 --> 17:05.058
while at the same time,

17:05.092 --> 17:07.260
you were working with the police
to spy on me.

17:07.294 --> 17:09.296
I had to know if you were
working with our mother.

17:09.329 --> 17:12.065
Okay, and I, and I understand
if you're angry--

17:12.098 --> 17:13.366
You understand nothing.

17:13.400 --> 17:14.534
So let me spell it out for you.

17:14.567 --> 17:16.769
You sell me the Fairwick
for a dollar,

17:16.803 --> 17:18.538
or I turn you into the Feds

17:18.570 --> 17:19.705
for insider trading.

17:19.739 --> 17:20.772
Wait, what?

17:20.807 --> 17:22.209
My buddy gave you a tip.

17:22.242 --> 17:23.609
You acted on it.

17:23.643 --> 17:25.112
Honestly,

17:25.145 --> 17:26.579
I thought you'd wait longer

17:26.613 --> 17:27.814
to spend the money you made,
but, man,

17:27.847 --> 17:29.416
you used it quick.

17:29.449 --> 17:30.683
You set me up.

17:33.320 --> 17:36.556
This place is really
gonna be something special.

17:36.589 --> 17:37.590
(door opens, closes)

17:44.697 --> 17:46.099
Hey.

17:46.133 --> 17:47.700
He took a long nap,
so he might be fussy

17:47.734 --> 17:50.503
when you put him down.
Got it.

17:50.537 --> 17:52.539
You okay?
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Well, he's being blackmailed

17:52.572 --> 17:53.873
by his brother,
 so that's a no.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.475
Yeah.

17:55.508 --> 17:57.577
Yeah, just...

17:57.610 --> 18:00.313
an unexpected hurdle
with the Fairwick acquisition.

18:00.347 --> 18:01.814
Okay.

18:01.848 --> 18:03.616
Well, whatever it is,

18:03.650 --> 18:05.685
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

18:05.718 --> 18:07.720
And speaking
 of figuring things out,

18:07.754 --> 18:10.590
Michael was adapting
 to his new life on set.

18:29.509 --> 18:31.378
I can't wait to cut
that line in post.

18:36.516 --> 18:37.650
(grunts)

18:37.684 --> 18:39.386
Cut!
DIRECTOR:
Cut!

18:39.419 --> 18:41.354
Did you see that?

18:41.388 --> 18:44.191
Fake fighting
is a carefully

18:44.224 --> 18:45.458
choreographed dance.

18:45.492 --> 18:46.726
To adlib a gesture like that

18:46.759 --> 18:49.262
is to put us both
in actual danger.

18:49.296 --> 18:50.397
No kidding.

18:50.430 --> 18:51.898
Plus if you wanted
to disarm someone

18:51.931 --> 18:53.766
believably, you'd
go for the wrist.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.202
What?

18:55.235 --> 18:56.769
No, I'm just saying
technically,

18:56.803 --> 18:58.771
if you wanted
to be accurate...

19:02.775 --> 19:05.245
Come with me.

19:05.278 --> 19:06.946
And in that moment,
 Rogelio realized

19:06.979 --> 19:09.549
he could kill two birds
 with one stone.

19:09.582 --> 19:11.218
Esteben, approach!

19:11.251 --> 19:12.785
Michael happens
to be an expert in combat,

19:12.819 --> 19:15.955
And he will now demonstrate
how to disarm someone.

19:15.988 --> 19:18.458
This guy?
(chuckles)

19:18.491 --> 19:20.827
Hit me with your best
shot, pretty boy.

19:20.860 --> 19:23.496
Bird one--
 build Michael up.

19:23.530 --> 19:25.732
(both grunting)

19:25.765 --> 19:27.800
Bird two-- torture Esteben.

19:27.834 --> 19:30.470
Bravo! Bravo!

19:30.503 --> 19:34.274
I'm promoting you to personal
bodyguard/technical advisor.

19:34.307 --> 19:36.776
From here on out, I want you
to monitor all our fights

19:36.809 --> 19:39.612
for authenticity.

19:39.646 --> 19:41.381
And I looked it up online,

19:41.414 --> 19:43.250
and technical advisors
make good money.

19:43.283 --> 19:44.651
And it's actually really fun.

19:44.684 --> 19:46.386
I'm so happy you're excited.

19:46.419 --> 19:47.587
Yeah, I really am.

19:47.620 --> 19:48.755
Okay.

19:48.788 --> 19:49.856
Time to become an expert

19:49.889 --> 19:52.692
in 15th century combat.

19:52.725 --> 19:54.861
And so Michael researched.

19:57.597 --> 19:59.299
And Wiki-ed.

19:59.332 --> 20:00.533
Oh.

20:02.902 --> 20:04.971
And googled.

20:09.008 --> 20:11.944
Until he was exhausted.

20:11.978 --> 20:13.513
(exhales)

20:13.546 --> 20:16.549
But satisfied.

20:16.583 --> 20:19.519
How's it going?
I think I'm starting to get
a handle on it, my lady.

20:19.552 --> 20:21.554
(both grunting)

20:21.588 --> 20:23.623
(phone ringing)

20:23.656 --> 20:25.024
Oh, good, it's Petra.

20:25.057 --> 20:27.394
Hopefully she got
her sister to confess.

20:27.427 --> 20:29.529
Hey, Petra.

20:29.562 --> 20:30.830
Did you say I'm a bad mother?

20:30.863 --> 20:32.532
Excuse me?

20:32.565 --> 20:34.667
Apparently you called
your grandmother to complain

20:34.701 --> 20:36.035
about how I didn't know
my children's nap times

20:36.068 --> 20:37.904
because I'm not a good mom.
 Oh, dear.

20:37.937 --> 20:40.540
No, I didn't use those words.

20:40.573 --> 20:42.375
Well, what words did you use?

20:42.409 --> 20:44.611
Well, look, you're
taking it out of context.

20:44.644 --> 20:46.646
I was actually defending you
to my grandmother.

20:46.679 --> 20:47.780
So, she was
calling me a bad mom?

20:47.814 --> 20:49.482
No! No!

20:49.516 --> 20:51.884
She was just annoyed
because she had to change

20:51.918 --> 20:52.885
her work schedule
and that's not easy for her.

20:52.919 --> 20:53.986
What are you implying?

20:54.020 --> 20:55.722
Nothing.
I know all about

20:55.755 --> 20:57.590
hard work, Jane-- I have a job.

20:57.624 --> 20:59.025
Yeah, well, I did, too,
until your sister got me fired!

20:59.058 --> 21:00.693
And maybe it was
 the heat of the moment

21:00.727 --> 21:02.629
or the fact that Petra finally

21:02.662 --> 21:04.297
had a little family
 of her own to protect,

21:04.331 --> 21:05.365
but she said...

21:05.398 --> 21:07.367
You know what, Jane?

21:07.400 --> 21:08.835
My sister said
she didn't place that ad,

21:08.868 --> 21:10.870
and I believe her,
so lay off.

21:11.938 --> 21:12.939
(groans, sighs)

21:19.912 --> 21:21.514
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Observe Jane steaming

21:21.548 --> 21:23.816
milk at the cappuccino machine.

21:23.850 --> 21:26.653
You can please Anezka
extra milk for cappuccino order?

21:26.686 --> 21:29.422
Oh, so foam is all
what is necessary

21:29.456 --> 21:31.090
for your cappuccino?

21:31.123 --> 21:32.759
I am not understanding...

21:32.792 --> 21:34.026
Oh, I think you
are understanding.

21:34.060 --> 21:35.628
So stop with this
whole innocent thing!

21:35.662 --> 21:37.063
I am being innocent.

21:37.096 --> 21:39.098
No you aren't.
You're a liar!

21:39.131 --> 21:40.633
And I don't know how,
but trust me,

21:40.667 --> 21:41.934
I'm gonna prove it!

21:43.536 --> 21:44.871
(crying)

21:45.938 --> 21:47.840
And she just started

21:47.874 --> 21:49.976
crying like
I'm some sort of--

21:50.009 --> 21:52.111
Ogre! Screaming!

21:52.144 --> 21:54.547
She being cruel and so--

21:54.581 --> 21:55.582
Manipulative.

21:55.615 --> 21:56.683
But I'm onto her.

21:56.716 --> 21:58.851
Acting like an innocent child.

21:58.885 --> 22:01.688
It felt like spank
hour at orphanage.

22:04.757 --> 22:06.926
No, we're taking
the high road here.

22:06.959 --> 22:09.061
If she's not canceling,
I'm not canceling.

22:09.095 --> 22:10.129
B-But just...

22:10.162 --> 22:13.600
maybe give Jane some space.

22:13.633 --> 22:15.602
But Anezka better stay
away from me.

22:15.635 --> 22:17.003
Otherwise, it's on!

22:17.036 --> 22:17.904
ROGELIO:
 En garde!

22:20.840 --> 22:21.574
(grunts)

22:27.514 --> 22:28.648
Cut!

22:28.681 --> 22:29.882
(bell rings)

22:29.916 --> 22:31.050
What...?

22:31.083 --> 22:33.620
Uh... is there a problem?

22:33.653 --> 22:35.688
Well, it's just that,
traditionally, you wouldn't lock

22:35.722 --> 22:37.023
the longswords like that,
because you'd often have

22:37.056 --> 22:38.558
a dagger as well,
in your other hand.

22:38.591 --> 22:39.759
So when the longswords
are locked,

22:39.792 --> 22:42.028
your opponent could,
like, stab you dead.

22:42.061 --> 22:43.396
With the dagger.

22:43.430 --> 22:44.764
That's wonderful.

22:44.797 --> 22:46.799
Thank you, Technical Advisor.

22:46.833 --> 22:48.768
Let's do it again
without locking the swords.

22:48.801 --> 22:51.037
But that is the most
compelling part of the scene.

22:51.070 --> 22:52.572
It's not about the swords,

22:52.605 --> 22:54.073
it's about my eyes.

22:54.106 --> 22:57.777
Historical accuracy
is also semi-important.

22:57.810 --> 23:00.513
We ready here?

23:00.547 --> 23:03.450
Settle and... action!

23:04.216 --> 23:05.952
MICHAEL:
Cut!

23:05.985 --> 23:07.487
(sword clatters, bell rings)

23:09.155 --> 23:10.590
Just the, uh,
the lunge...

23:10.623 --> 23:11.791
the lunge
felt a little...

23:11.824 --> 23:14.561
Can you excuse us
for one second?

23:14.594 --> 23:16.128
Michael...

23:16.162 --> 23:18.565
The work you're doing
is wonderful.

23:18.598 --> 23:21.834
But you cannot yell "cut"
while we're shooting.

23:21.868 --> 23:23.035
Only the director

23:23.069 --> 23:24.837
and the star can do that.

23:24.871 --> 23:27.073
Right. I just got excited.

23:27.106 --> 23:28.475
I understand.

23:28.508 --> 23:29.876
So how do I
communicate to you

23:29.909 --> 23:31.077
if you guys are way off

23:31.110 --> 23:32.579
and it's not believable...

23:32.612 --> 23:35.515
Well, that's the thing.

23:35.548 --> 23:37.049
You see, it's a telenovela.

23:37.083 --> 23:40.953
So things don't have to be
completely believable.

23:40.987 --> 23:42.154
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 That's an understatement.

23:42.188 --> 23:43.189
Ah!

23:45.958 --> 23:47.193
Oh, my God.

23:47.226 --> 23:48.127
What's the holdup here?

23:48.160 --> 23:49.662
Oh, I'm sorry. Yes.

23:49.696 --> 23:51.063
I have to shoot this,

23:51.097 --> 23:52.765
so I can get out by dinner.

23:52.799 --> 23:54.634
Okay.

23:57.604 --> 23:59.105
And it's already
five minutes past

23:59.138 --> 24:00.607
one little boy's bedtime,

24:00.640 --> 24:01.941
isn't it, Mr. Sweetface,
isn't it?

24:01.974 --> 24:03.510
Oh, yes. (kissing sounds)

24:03.543 --> 24:04.777
(phone chimes)
Oh.

24:18.758 --> 24:22.028
Okay, let's say good
night to Abuela.

24:22.061 --> 24:24.030
Oh.
(phone chimes)

24:29.201 --> 24:31.003
What's going on over there?

24:31.037 --> 24:33.573
I-It's Dad.

24:33.606 --> 24:35.775
He wants me to coach him
through this party, in person.

24:36.809 --> 24:38.578
I'm-I'm just gonna say no.

24:38.611 --> 24:39.746
Stop. Go.

24:39.779 --> 24:41.013
No, Mom. I feel weird.

24:41.047 --> 24:41.881
Because of me?

24:42.782 --> 24:44.851
Don't. Honestly.

24:44.884 --> 24:47.286
Actually, knowing that
he and Dina are both out

24:47.319 --> 24:50.723
makes it easier for me to go
record my track at the studio.

24:50.757 --> 24:52.258
No chance of running into them.

24:52.291 --> 24:54.661
Go, hon.

24:54.694 --> 24:56.763
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Which brings us here, now...

24:56.796 --> 24:59.131
Jane, you made it!

24:59.165 --> 25:00.667
Everyone,

25:00.700 --> 25:01.734
meet my brilliant daughter,
Jane!

25:01.768 --> 25:03.302
You invited your daughter?

25:03.335 --> 25:06.205
MAN: Here, ha-have
a seat, Jane.
No, wait!

25:06.238 --> 25:08.307
Sit next to me.
I need you close.

25:08.340 --> 25:09.876
Why?
JANE:
It's okay.

25:09.909 --> 25:10.643
I'll sit here.

25:10.677 --> 25:11.711
Okay, well...

25:11.744 --> 25:13.079
there is perfect.

25:13.112 --> 25:14.781
Just wanted to make sure

25:14.814 --> 25:17.550
you were comfortable.

25:17.584 --> 25:18.885
(phone chimes)

25:18.918 --> 25:21.621
ROGELIO: My daughter is
a brilliant student.

25:21.654 --> 25:22.955
She's in graduate school.

25:22.989 --> 25:24.691
WOMAN:
My son's at Oxford.

25:24.724 --> 25:26.192
Oh. England.
Great...

25:26.225 --> 25:28.227
and important country.

25:28.260 --> 25:29.696
Shakespeare and...

25:29.729 --> 25:31.097
How do you know Dina?

25:31.130 --> 25:32.932
WOMAN:
We were actually
in debate together

25:32.965 --> 25:34.233
in college.

25:34.266 --> 25:36.569
Oh, I dabble myself
in debate, as well.

25:36.603 --> 25:38.771
I once played
a great debater on Tiago.

25:38.805 --> 25:40.873
I owned the Senate floor!

25:40.907 --> 25:43.342
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Wow! He's fast
 with his fingers!

25:43.375 --> 25:47.079
* La mujer de amor

25:47.113 --> 25:51.751
* Es un secreto en la noche

25:51.784 --> 25:54.987
* La mujer de mi

25:55.021 --> 25:58.324
(reaching for high note):
* Alma...

25:58.357 --> 26:00.660
(sighs) Let me try again.

26:00.693 --> 26:02.294
Oh, sorry, man.

26:02.328 --> 26:04.163
We're running
a little behind.

26:04.196 --> 26:05.898
Do you want to come back
in 20 for your ADR?

26:06.799 --> 26:08.100
I'll wait.

26:08.134 --> 26:09.168
*

26:09.201 --> 26:11.704
* La mujer de mi

26:11.738 --> 26:16.175
* Alma...

26:16.208 --> 26:18.210
(sighs) I'm sorry.

26:18.244 --> 26:20.212
You're just too in your head.

26:21.147 --> 26:22.982
Don't just sing it.

26:23.015 --> 26:24.851
Hmm?

26:24.884 --> 26:26.052
Feel it.

26:26.085 --> 26:28.755
Seduce the
microphone.

26:30.222 --> 26:31.824
I'm not with Rogelio anymore,

26:31.858 --> 26:33.860
so flirting with me
isn't gonna hurt him.

26:33.893 --> 26:35.094
Oh.

26:35.127 --> 26:37.229
You know what else works
to get the note?

26:37.263 --> 26:39.265
You can use the ground
to stabilize.

26:39.298 --> 26:40.667
Hmm.

26:40.700 --> 26:43.002
Lie down.
Seriously.

26:43.035 --> 26:44.704
You take all the support
of the earth

26:44.737 --> 26:47.239
and then you sing up
instead of out.

26:48.040 --> 26:49.241
Shakira taught me.

26:49.275 --> 26:51.944
I mean, I'll try.

26:51.978 --> 26:53.412
You're going to feel
silly at first.

26:53.445 --> 26:55.214
But just put
that aside, okay?

26:55.247 --> 26:56.749
Okay.

26:56.783 --> 26:59.952
*
* La mujer de mi

26:59.986 --> 27:07.026
* Alma!

27:07.059 --> 27:09.161
Huh.

27:09.195 --> 27:10.062
Hmm?

27:10.096 --> 27:11.764
Wow.

27:11.798 --> 27:13.700
You're a good coach.

27:13.733 --> 27:15.201
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And speaking of coaches...

27:15.234 --> 27:16.803
Thanks to Jane,

27:16.836 --> 27:18.905
Rogelio had successfully

27:18.938 --> 27:20.840
navigated culture and politics.

27:20.873 --> 27:23.309
It's a clear perversion
of the 14th Amendment.

27:23.342 --> 27:26.779
Not at all what our founding
fathers meant, you know?

27:26.813 --> 27:28.080
Exactly.
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Even science.

27:28.114 --> 27:31.050
I don't think
we can fully comprehend

27:31.083 --> 27:34.186
the profound impact of
the Higgs boson particle.

27:34.220 --> 27:37.456
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 In fact, his knowledge
 was on fleek, until...

27:37.489 --> 27:39.458
Free trade with Cuba
is essential.

27:39.491 --> 27:41.060
Just look at the great success

27:41.093 --> 27:42.394
of the Nazi alliance.

27:42.428 --> 27:44.130
Oh!

27:44.163 --> 27:45.832
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Well, until Jane failed to see

27:45.865 --> 27:47.466
her phone's misguided
 autocorrect.

27:47.499 --> 27:49.068
Um, excuse me?

27:49.101 --> 27:51.003
The "great success"?

27:51.037 --> 27:52.238
No, no!

27:52.271 --> 27:55.207
No. That wasn't a great success.

27:55.241 --> 27:58.244
No. What I meant was...

28:02.749 --> 28:04.016
Yes?

28:04.050 --> 28:06.352
Oh, j-just that the,

28:06.385 --> 28:10.389
you know,
the Nazi alliance...

28:10.422 --> 28:13.692
Jane? What...
what do I mean?

28:16.362 --> 28:17.730
NATO...
(clears throat)

28:17.764 --> 28:19.165
The NATO alliance.

28:28.307 --> 28:30.977
So, what? You brought
your daughter out

28:31.010 --> 28:32.378
to do some Cyrano thing?
No.

28:32.411 --> 28:33.980
It was like...

28:34.013 --> 28:35.281
Have you seen the movie Roxanne?

28:36.348 --> 28:37.784
It's just...

28:37.817 --> 28:39.786
well, you know...

28:39.819 --> 28:43.155
I wanted to impress
your smart friends.

28:43.189 --> 28:45.758
Because I like you, Dina.

28:45.792 --> 28:47.159
That's why
I'm wearing

28:47.193 --> 28:49.028
these ridiculous glasses

28:49.061 --> 28:52.198
and talking about silly things
like literature or science.

28:52.231 --> 28:54.533
Well, the whole thing...
it was stupid.

28:54.566 --> 28:56.368
I know. I agree.

28:56.402 --> 28:57.770
But also...

28:57.804 --> 28:59.305
whatever...

28:59.338 --> 29:00.506
kind of sweet.

29:00.539 --> 29:01.307
Yeah?

29:01.340 --> 29:02.741
Yeah.

29:13.920 --> 29:15.054
Jane!

29:15.087 --> 29:16.923
Oh, hey.

29:16.956 --> 29:19.425
I-I was just texting you.
Looks like you have

29:19.458 --> 29:21.560
the situation under control,
so I was gonna head home.

29:21.593 --> 29:22.795
What's wrong?

29:22.829 --> 29:24.931
Nothing, I just...

29:25.932 --> 29:27.566
(sighs) Okay.

29:27.599 --> 29:32.204
Well... earlier, I felt weird
helping you with Dina

29:32.238 --> 29:34.173
because I thought
it would upset Mom.

29:34.206 --> 29:36.475
And I didn't want you to think
that I was picking sides, so...

29:36.508 --> 29:37.944
Was your mother upset?
No.

29:37.977 --> 29:40.079
No. She's... she's okay.

29:40.112 --> 29:41.447
That's the point.

29:41.480 --> 29:43.916
I realized, watching you,

29:43.950 --> 29:46.252
it's not about Mom.

29:46.285 --> 29:48.087
It's about me.

29:48.120 --> 29:49.455
It's that fairytale, right?

29:49.488 --> 29:52.892
Your divorced parents meet,
fall back in love...

29:52.925 --> 29:54.927
Of course.

29:54.961 --> 29:57.029
That's what makes The Parent
 Trap such an evocative film.

29:57.063 --> 29:58.330
Exactly.

29:58.364 --> 29:59.565
And don't get me wrong,

29:59.598 --> 30:01.033
I want you to be happy,

30:01.067 --> 30:03.335
and Dina's great.

30:03.369 --> 30:05.571
I just think I need
a little more time

30:05.604 --> 30:07.173
before I can be your wingman.

30:07.206 --> 30:09.075
I understand.

30:09.108 --> 30:11.043
Thank you for your help.

30:11.077 --> 30:13.112
I know you're always on my side.

30:17.283 --> 30:19.318
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And speaking of taking sides...

30:19.351 --> 30:20.853
JANE:
 Okay.

30:20.887 --> 30:22.188
I just want things calm
 and peaceful.

30:22.221 --> 30:23.622
This is a happy occasion.

30:23.655 --> 30:24.991
Happy and awkward.

30:25.024 --> 30:27.059
No. N awkward.

30:27.093 --> 30:28.928
We will make it not awkward.

30:28.961 --> 30:31.597
How is it not being awkward?
Jane is hating both of us.

30:31.630 --> 30:33.232
Just smile, Anezka.

30:33.265 --> 30:34.867
(knocking at door)
Even if it's fake.

30:36.668 --> 30:38.104
Like this.

30:39.505 --> 30:41.140
Happy Mother's Day!

30:41.173 --> 30:43.509
I adjusted
things a little.

30:43.542 --> 30:44.877
Buffet style.

30:44.911 --> 30:46.145
Oh. Thank you.

30:46.178 --> 30:47.646
And here.

30:47.679 --> 30:49.248
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Yeah, there's no way

30:49.281 --> 30:50.416
this isn't awkward.
Oh.

30:50.449 --> 30:52.551
Assorted colors. How fun.

30:55.254 --> 30:56.388
So, anyone care
for a drink?

30:56.422 --> 30:58.290
Yes.
Yes. Okay. Thank you.

30:58.324 --> 30:59.525
Sí, sí, sí.
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Me, too!

30:59.558 --> 31:01.293
In fact, I have an idea.

31:01.327 --> 31:02.895
Every time something awkward
 happens at this brunch,

31:02.929 --> 31:04.296
let's take a sip
 of our mimosas.

31:04.330 --> 31:06.432
Kids, you have orange juice.

31:06.465 --> 31:07.633
Let's start with an easy one.

31:11.003 --> 31:13.072
Which his brother is now
 blackmailing him for.

31:13.105 --> 31:15.407
Thanks. It's, uh...

31:15.441 --> 31:18.077
Unexpectedly awkward. Drink!

31:18.110 --> 31:20.112
So, how are things with Dina?

31:20.146 --> 31:21.447
Drink!

31:21.480 --> 31:23.649
This feel a little
weird to you?

31:23.682 --> 31:25.351
Wait until Father's Day.

31:25.384 --> 31:27.353
Drink!

31:28.487 --> 31:30.556
Breathe, Jane. Breathe!

31:30.589 --> 31:32.424
But the rest of you, drink!

31:33.425 --> 31:35.127
(sighs)

31:35.161 --> 31:37.396
Oh, these two are in
 a relatively good place.

31:37.429 --> 31:38.998
Maybe we can take
 a water break.

31:39.031 --> 31:41.633
Ah! Enjoying the most
awkward brunch ever?

31:41.667 --> 31:43.936
(laughs)
Is your brother coming?

31:43.970 --> 31:45.137
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Agh! Drink!

31:45.171 --> 31:47.473
I don't think so, no.

31:47.506 --> 31:49.475
Rafael?

31:49.508 --> 31:50.909
What's going on?

31:53.145 --> 31:56.015
I don't know if I should
tell you or not.

31:56.048 --> 31:58.017
You should. Definitely.

32:00.586 --> 32:03.689
I made a bad decision.

32:03.722 --> 32:05.624
And now my brother
is blackmailing me.

32:05.657 --> 32:07.493
What? How?

32:07.526 --> 32:11.163
I made money off
an illegal stock tip.

32:11.197 --> 32:12.698
I didn't know
it was illegal.

32:12.731 --> 32:14.266
Derek set me up.

32:14.300 --> 32:16.302
And now he's using it
to extort money from me.

32:16.335 --> 32:19.238
Specifically, the Fairwick.

32:19.271 --> 32:21.373
But if you didn't know,
then it's not your fault.

32:21.407 --> 32:23.175
I didn't know.

32:25.744 --> 32:27.279
But then, after I knew,

32:27.313 --> 32:29.181
I used it to buy the Fairwick.

32:29.215 --> 32:31.450
I know.

32:31.483 --> 32:33.719
I screwed up.

32:33.752 --> 32:35.421
I thought I was
taking care of my family.

32:35.454 --> 32:37.056
What are you going to do?

32:37.089 --> 32:40.126
I don't know.
(Mateo fusses)

32:40.159 --> 32:41.593
I'm going to to
give him a bottle.

32:42.694 --> 32:44.196
It'll be okay.

32:44.230 --> 32:45.998
MICHAEL:
 I knew it.

32:46.032 --> 32:47.266
I knew Derek was shady.

32:47.299 --> 32:49.035
(giggles)

32:49.068 --> 32:50.336
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Weird sense of humor, Mateo.

32:50.369 --> 32:52.271
Michael, you can't say anything.

32:52.304 --> 32:53.472
He told me in confidence.

32:53.505 --> 32:54.740
MICHAEL:
But the police
need to know,

32:54.773 --> 32:56.308
because it could help
our investigation--

32:56.342 --> 32:57.576
their investigation.

32:57.609 --> 32:59.311
Just... try to see
if you can get him

32:59.345 --> 33:00.679
to come forward. If you can.

33:00.712 --> 33:02.514
Your father's calling everyone.

33:06.518 --> 33:08.487
I made a little something

33:08.520 --> 33:10.089
in honor of

33:10.122 --> 33:12.091
my daughter's first official

33:12.124 --> 33:14.560
Mother's Day.

33:14.593 --> 33:17.529
ROGELIO:
 What made Jane a great mother?

33:17.563 --> 33:19.231
What makes Jane a great mom?

33:19.265 --> 33:20.732
(crying):
So many things?

33:20.766 --> 33:22.234
Oh, wow.

33:22.268 --> 33:24.670
Okay, I can't cry right away,
right?

33:24.703 --> 33:27.239
The way she always
puts family first.

33:32.378 --> 33:33.745
She's got your back,

33:33.779 --> 33:37.783
and she pushes you to be the
best version of yourself.

33:37.816 --> 33:38.750
RAFAEL:
Jane always sees

33:38.784 --> 33:39.685
the good in people.

33:39.718 --> 33:41.353
The world she lives in,

33:41.387 --> 33:42.621
that's the world
 I want to live in.

33:42.654 --> 33:43.789
MICHAEL:
She's generous.

33:43.822 --> 33:44.656
Resourceful.

33:44.690 --> 33:46.392
ROGELIO:
Kind.

33:46.425 --> 33:48.160
XIOMARA:
I'm in awe of how she tackles

33:48.194 --> 33:48.827
every problem head-on.

33:48.860 --> 33:50.262
It's inspiring.

33:51.197 --> 33:52.331
MICHAEL:
She's fair.

33:52.364 --> 33:53.365
ROGELIO:
Jane's a peace-maker.

33:53.399 --> 33:54.833
Always on everyone's side.

33:54.866 --> 33:56.635
She's like Switzerland.

33:56.668 --> 33:58.504
I learned all about Switzerland
in my cram session.

33:58.537 --> 33:59.771
(laughs)

33:59.805 --> 34:01.307
MICHAEL:
Generous. Thoughtful.

34:01.340 --> 34:02.341
XIOMARA:
Smart.

34:03.509 --> 34:05.344
ROGELIO:
Patient.

34:07.279 --> 34:08.179
Lists.

34:08.214 --> 34:09.415
RAFAEL:
So many lists.

34:09.447 --> 34:11.683
(laughs)
ROGELIO:
Like, a lot of lists.

34:11.717 --> 34:13.185
What? There's a lot to organize.

34:13.219 --> 34:15.521
But really it's...

34:15.554 --> 34:17.089
it's how much she loves.

34:18.224 --> 34:18.924
Love.

34:18.956 --> 34:20.326
MICHAEL:
I know it sounds cheesy,

34:20.359 --> 34:23.562
but... love.

34:23.594 --> 34:26.232
And superb genes.

34:26.264 --> 34:28.699
So happy first Mother's Day.

34:29.868 --> 34:31.270
My daughter.

34:31.303 --> 34:33.139
(babbling)

34:33.172 --> 34:35.574
(crying):
Aw.

34:36.542 --> 34:41.780
(babbling)

34:41.813 --> 34:43.782
Thanks, Dad.

34:46.485 --> 34:48.487
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR (slurring):
 Here we go again.

34:48.520 --> 34:50.489
Awkward.

34:50.522 --> 34:51.723
It's her Mother's Day too,
 right?

34:51.757 --> 34:52.491
(burps)

34:52.524 --> 34:53.659
Excuse me.

34:53.692 --> 34:55.127
I drank a little too much.

34:55.161 --> 34:58.397
I am also wanting
to say something

34:58.430 --> 35:00.832
about what a wonderful mother
I am thinking you are, Petra.

35:00.866 --> 35:02.268
This life...

35:02.301 --> 35:03.469
This life

35:03.502 --> 35:07.139
that you have earned
for your daughters

35:07.173 --> 35:08.507
after coming from nothing.

35:08.540 --> 35:10.676
And I am just thinking

35:10.709 --> 35:13.245
it is so beautiful

35:13.279 --> 35:15.514
what you have done for them.

35:15.547 --> 35:17.816
And I know how hard it has been.

35:24.190 --> 35:25.224
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Well, that was

35:25.257 --> 35:26.525
legitimately sweet.

35:26.558 --> 35:27.793
And while we're sharing
 about our moms,

35:27.826 --> 35:29.895
can I just say
 I have the greatest,

35:29.928 --> 35:32.498
most supportive,
 bestest mother ever.

35:32.531 --> 35:34.533
Love you, Mama. So much.

35:34.566 --> 35:36.402
Right, well, I think
 I got to lay down.

35:36.435 --> 35:39.438
Thank you for having us.

35:39.471 --> 35:41.507
And that was a very nice speech.

35:41.540 --> 35:43.442
I'm glad it worked out.

35:43.475 --> 35:44.376
Us together

35:44.410 --> 35:46.545
is everything what I want.

35:46.578 --> 35:49.715
Okay, listen, you said it again.

35:49.748 --> 35:50.816
What?

35:50.849 --> 35:52.451
I know you placed that ad,

35:52.484 --> 35:53.919
and, look,
you may have a good reason.

35:53.952 --> 35:55.321
If you could just come clean...

35:55.354 --> 35:56.655
Jane, stop.

35:56.688 --> 35:57.789
You're beating a dead horse.

35:57.823 --> 35:58.757
(horse whinnies)

35:58.790 --> 36:01.793
I can't stop because
your sister is a liar,

36:01.827 --> 36:03.529
and you are too close to see it.

36:03.562 --> 36:05.597
You just blindly follow
what she says like a sheep.

36:05.631 --> 36:06.665
(sheep bleats)

36:06.698 --> 36:07.833
Are you saying my sister's
a bad person

36:07.866 --> 36:09.535
and I'm just too close
to her to see it?

36:09.568 --> 36:10.902
I never said that.
You might as well have.

36:10.936 --> 36:13.439
(cat screeches)
Okay, enough, someone take that
toy away from him.

36:13.472 --> 36:16.842
Excuse me?
I host your entire family here
for lunch, and all you can do

36:16.875 --> 36:18.810
is to continue to hurl insults
at my sister.

36:18.844 --> 36:19.978
No, please.

36:20.011 --> 36:21.547
No fighting because of Anezka.

36:21.580 --> 36:24.416
I'm insulting your sister
because she's a liar!

36:24.450 --> 36:25.451
Please no!

36:25.484 --> 36:26.452
She's not!
She is!

36:26.485 --> 36:27.686
She's not!

36:28.954 --> 36:29.921
BOTH:
Oh!

36:29.955 --> 36:31.323
(gasping)

36:35.694 --> 36:39.265
I am so sorry about your sister.

36:39.298 --> 36:40.466
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Wait.

36:40.499 --> 36:41.700
What's going on?
 What did I miss?

36:41.733 --> 36:43.669
Where are we?
 Oh, wow.

36:43.702 --> 36:45.471
The room is spinning.

36:45.504 --> 36:48.874
I obviously never, ever meant

36:48.907 --> 36:50.276
for anything like this
to happen.

36:50.309 --> 36:51.510
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Is Anezka dead?

36:51.543 --> 36:52.911
It's okay. She's fine.

36:52.944 --> 36:53.912
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Whew.

36:53.945 --> 36:54.980
Okay.

36:55.013 --> 36:56.415
So why are we at the hospital?

36:56.448 --> 36:57.583
She's epileptic,

36:57.616 --> 37:00.819
so seizures
will happen sometimes.

37:00.852 --> 37:02.254
Under extreme stress.

37:02.288 --> 37:04.856
Well, I'm sorry I caused it.

37:04.890 --> 37:07.025
I just...
I really thought she did it.

37:07.058 --> 37:09.661
And she said she didn't.

37:09.695 --> 37:10.796
And as you can see,

37:10.829 --> 37:13.299
she's an emotionally
fragile person,

37:13.332 --> 37:14.533
which is why I didn't push her.

37:14.566 --> 37:16.335
I get it.

37:16.368 --> 37:17.369
Again, I'm so sorry.

37:19.771 --> 37:20.739
NURSE:
She'll be okay.

37:20.772 --> 37:23.609
Just keep stress levels down.

37:23.642 --> 37:25.611
Lots of fluids, lots of rest.

37:25.644 --> 37:28.314
Thank you so much.

37:28.347 --> 37:29.448
(crying):
I am feeling terrible

37:29.481 --> 37:30.449
for ruining special lunch.

37:30.482 --> 37:31.550
As long as you're okay.

37:31.583 --> 37:33.619
No, I'm not being okay.

37:33.652 --> 37:36.555
I cause everybody
so much fighting.

37:36.588 --> 37:39.024
So, you don't have to lie
for me anymore, Petra.

37:39.057 --> 37:40.492
What?

37:40.526 --> 37:43.295
Yes, I am the one that post ad.

37:43.329 --> 37:44.830
And Petra,
just being good sister,

37:44.863 --> 37:45.864
took cover for me.

37:48.800 --> 37:51.637
You were lying this whole time?
No.

37:51.670 --> 37:53.305
It's okay now, Petra,
I come clean.

37:53.339 --> 37:55.441
I want an e-mail
explaining what you did

37:55.474 --> 37:57.042
so I can try and salvage my job.

37:57.075 --> 37:58.877
Yes, of course.

38:01.613 --> 38:03.949
And I have nothing
to say to you.

38:08.086 --> 38:09.455
I was so naive

38:09.488 --> 38:10.789
to think that she'd changed.

38:10.822 --> 38:13.825
That we would be
one big happy family.

38:13.859 --> 38:14.760
You know what?

38:14.793 --> 38:18.464
Let's stop talking
about the evil twins.

38:18.497 --> 38:20.566
And start watching
the evil twins.

38:20.599 --> 38:21.667
Amen.

38:21.700 --> 38:25.070
And Mateo can play
with his new toys.

38:25.103 --> 38:26.572
(gasp)
Yeah, buddy.

38:26.605 --> 38:28.607
Ooh.

38:28.640 --> 38:29.975
While we...

38:30.008 --> 38:31.410
get cozy with the remote.

38:31.443 --> 38:32.844
Mm-hmm.

38:35.781 --> 38:37.349
And I'll order ice cream.

38:37.383 --> 38:39.117
Ooh.
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 At long last,

38:39.150 --> 38:42.421
pj's, pints...

38:42.454 --> 38:44.322
and telenovelas.

38:46.525 --> 38:47.959
Which brings us here,
 of course.

38:47.993 --> 38:49.695
Look, I'm...

38:49.728 --> 38:52.864
I'm sorry I came on so strong
with the Tech Advisor thing.

38:52.898 --> 38:54.733
(chuckles)
I guess I just got carried away.

38:54.766 --> 38:57.636
Well, your attention to detail,

38:57.669 --> 38:59.838
that's what made you
such a terrific detective.

38:59.871 --> 39:01.840
Whereas in telenovelas,

39:01.873 --> 39:03.442
it's more the general idea.

39:03.475 --> 39:05.377
Yeah, I get that.

39:05.411 --> 39:07.579
You will be a
detective again, Michael.

39:07.613 --> 39:08.414
I believe in you.

39:10.616 --> 39:11.550
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And friends,

39:11.583 --> 39:12.551
that's when it happened.

39:12.584 --> 39:14.620
And... action!

39:14.653 --> 39:16.054
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 In a moment that was...

39:16.087 --> 39:17.656
well, straight out
 of a telenovela, frankly.

39:36.608 --> 39:38.677
SUZANNA: This is Suzanna Barnett
at the Miami PD,

39:38.710 --> 39:39.745
please leave a message.
(beep)

39:39.778 --> 39:41.012
I need to talk to you.

39:41.046 --> 39:42.681
Turns out Derek Ruvelle

39:42.714 --> 39:44.015
is totally dirty
and I've got proof.

39:44.049 --> 39:47.118
I know the GPS on his boat
corroborated his alibi,

39:47.152 --> 39:48.787
but I don't think
he was ever on that boat.

39:48.820 --> 39:50.689
Call me back. Please.

39:50.722 --> 39:52.123
Help me finish this case.

39:52.157 --> 39:54.192
Next time, wait for my guests
to finish their food

39:54.225 --> 39:55.461
before you dive in.

39:55.494 --> 39:57.395
Yes, Ms. Petra.
Of course.

40:03.201 --> 40:05.637
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Leaping lizards! It's Anezka.

40:05.671 --> 40:08.039
This is exactly what happened
 in Lagrimas de tu Corazon.

40:08.073 --> 40:09.541
And it really didn't end well.

40:09.575 --> 40:10.976
And then I forwarded
the confession,

40:11.009 --> 40:13.912
but Blake is just digging in.

40:13.945 --> 40:17.449
I am officially
out of a TA job next semester.

40:17.483 --> 40:19.084
XIOMARA:
I'm sorry, honey.

40:19.117 --> 40:20.652
(sighs)

40:20.686 --> 40:21.487
I know.

40:21.520 --> 40:23.989
Did you see
Dad's Instagram feed?

40:24.022 --> 40:25.757
Yeah.

40:25.791 --> 40:27.192
It's okay, hun.

40:27.225 --> 40:28.193
Really.

40:28.226 --> 40:29.528
He had to move on.

40:29.561 --> 40:34.099
Can I just say
how proud I am of you

40:34.132 --> 40:36.134
for how you've handled this?

40:36.167 --> 40:37.569
I mean,

40:37.603 --> 40:39.671
the old you would've acted out.

40:39.705 --> 40:40.739
I'm trying to change.

40:40.772 --> 40:42.674
Let's talk later, hun.

40:42.708 --> 40:44.442
Okay, bye.

40:48.013 --> 40:49.748
So...

40:49.781 --> 40:51.082
Who's better?

40:51.116 --> 40:52.718
Me or Rogelio?

40:52.751 --> 40:54.753
Be honest.

40:54.786 --> 40:57.055
Look, I made a huge mistake.

40:57.088 --> 40:58.990
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 How huge was it exactly?

40:59.024 --> 40:59.991
The most huge

41:00.025 --> 41:01.660
or second hugest?

41:01.693 --> 41:03.529
Sorry, I shouldn't joke.

41:03.562 --> 41:05.597
This is serious stuff.

41:05.631 --> 41:08.634
So Derek's blackmailing you?

41:08.667 --> 41:10.802
I overheard Jane telling Michael
at the lunch.

41:10.836 --> 41:12.103
What were you thinking?

41:12.137 --> 41:15.073
I wasn't.

41:15.106 --> 41:16.708
I was drunk
when I bought the stock.

41:16.742 --> 41:17.943
No, not that.

41:17.976 --> 41:20.278
Going to Jane for advice.

41:20.311 --> 41:22.080
Go to Jane for help
looking for...

41:22.113 --> 41:23.248
a new book club selection,

41:23.281 --> 41:25.551
or finding a deal on diapers.

41:25.584 --> 41:26.718
When it comes
to financial crimes,

41:26.752 --> 41:27.719
and blackmail,

41:27.753 --> 41:28.887
come to me.

41:30.856 --> 41:32.691
Buy a few days with Derek,

41:32.724 --> 41:34.860
while we come up with a plan.

41:34.893 --> 41:36.127
We can outsmart him.

41:36.161 --> 41:37.262
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And, perhaps,

41:37.295 --> 41:38.630
they could outsmart him.

41:42.067 --> 41:45.971
Darling, enough already with
those ridiculous scarves.

41:46.004 --> 41:47.973
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Her, on the other hand,

41:48.006 --> 41:49.775
slightly more difficult.

41:49.808 --> 41:51.142
So, everything's moving forward.

41:51.176 --> 41:53.278
We'll have the Fairwick
by the end of the week.

41:56.181 --> 41:57.649
Happy Mother's Day.

41:59.150 --> 42:01.252
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Now that's a boat.
