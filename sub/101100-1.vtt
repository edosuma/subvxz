00:28.620 --> 00:29.654
<i>Okay then.</i>

00:29.721 --> 00:31.891
<i>I'll tell you how I met Elvis.</i>

00:34.193 --> 00:37.762
<i>It was when he came back
from Alpha Centauri.</i>

00:39.866 --> 00:44.803
<i>You see, he had been living
there for the past 30 years</i>

00:44.871 --> 00:46.738
<i>with friendly aliens.</i>

00:54.180 --> 00:56.849
<i>He was almost dead
when they got him.</i>

00:56.916 --> 01:00.785
<i>So they transferred his energy,
his essence,</i>

01:00.853 --> 01:04.123
<i>into a bio-engineered body
they'd built for him</i>

01:04.190 --> 01:05.858
<i>called a biosuit.</i>

01:06.826 --> 01:08.261
<i>He looked a little different</i>

01:08.327 --> 01:12.064
<i>but he felt
like he was 25 again.</i>

01:14.666 --> 01:16.468
<i>At first he was happy,</i>

01:16.534 --> 01:18.603
<i>they'd saved his life.</i>

01:18.670 --> 01:22.208
<i>He saw what no other man
had ever seen.</i>

01:22.275 --> 01:25.044
<i>He knew the friendship of beings
from another world</i>

01:25.111 --> 01:29.048
<i>and he found new fans
everywhere he went.</i>

01:29.115 --> 01:32.784
<i>Turns out music really
is the universal language.</i>

01:32.852 --> 01:35.955
<i>So the universe loved Elvis,
of course.</i>

01:42.061 --> 01:46.765
<i>But as the years went by,
he got more and more homesick.</i>

01:46.832 --> 01:49.068
<i>Something was troubling him.</i>

01:50.568 --> 01:52.905
<i>He took to singing the blues,</i>

01:52.972 --> 01:56.508
<i>his heart was filled with pain.</i>

01:56.574 --> 02:00.246
<i>The aliens were so empathetic
they could hardly bear it</i>

02:00.313 --> 02:03.049
<i>when he sang those sad songs.</i>

02:03.115 --> 02:06.551
<i>So they decided
to take him back home,</i>

02:06.618 --> 02:08.955
<i>so maybe he could
be happy again.</i>

02:11.223 --> 02:12.757
<i>There was just one problem,</i>

02:12.824 --> 02:15.760
<i>you see, the body they'd built
for Elvis</i>

02:15.828 --> 02:17.762
<i>had been grown in space,</i>

02:17.830 --> 02:20.532
<i>in a low gravity environment.</i>

02:20.598 --> 02:24.669
<i>The aliens didn't know how the
cells would hold up on Earth.</i>

02:24.736 --> 02:26.771
<i>I mean, you got your gravity,</i>

02:26.839 --> 02:29.842
<i>atmospheric pressure,
and whatnot,</i>

02:29.909 --> 02:33.478
<i>out in space, they didn't have
those kinda problems.</i>

02:38.084 --> 02:40.552
<i>What they did know
was that the skeleton</i>

02:40.618 --> 02:42.021
<i>would start to collapse,</i>

02:42.088 --> 02:45.824
<i>and the cells would age
at an accelerated rate.</i>

02:45.891 --> 02:47.893
<i>His organs
would cease to function,</i>

02:47.960 --> 02:50.196
<i>and his heart
would stop beating.</i>

02:50.262 --> 02:53.099
<i>If he didn't get back
to the ship in time,</i>

02:53.165 --> 02:54.499
<i>he would die.</i>

02:55.901 --> 02:57.903
<i>But Elvis didn't care.</i>

02:57.970 --> 03:00.705
<i>He was willing to
take the chance,</i>

03:00.772 --> 03:03.042
<i>he had to take the chance.</i>

03:12.650 --> 03:14.320
<i>He's coming.</i>

03:14.387 --> 03:18.823
<i>It cannot be stopped,
he sends you this message.</i>

03:21.093 --> 03:23.762
Can you please help me
find a woman named Linda?

03:23.829 --> 03:27.967
Linda Beth Truman,
born around 1960.

03:28.034 --> 03:31.070
<i>I don't have much time,
so please,</i>

03:31.137 --> 03:34.140
<i>please help me
find Linda Truman.</i>

05:29.188 --> 05:34.059
<i>It was 2007,
out there on federal land.</i>

05:36.495 --> 05:37.997
<i>The CIA picked him up...</i>

05:38.063 --> 05:39.865
Good evening, sir.

05:39.932 --> 05:41.901
<i>...somewhere
south of Vegas.</i>

05:44.937 --> 05:46.372
<i>Top secret stuff.</i>

05:53.412 --> 05:55.881
<i>Only those
with top level clearances</i>

05:55.948 --> 05:57.483
<i>knew about the mission.</i>

05:57.550 --> 06:00.452
<i>This group of agents
was a special detail</i>

06:00.519 --> 06:04.789
<i>organized by the CIA
to escort and protect Elvis</i>

06:04.857 --> 06:06.691
<i>while he was here on Earth.</i>

06:10.429 --> 06:12.932
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

06:12.998 --> 06:15.868
Kirby's in the car,
they've picked up the guy

06:15.935 --> 06:17.369
and they'll be here any minute.

06:17.903 --> 06:19.138
Yes sir.

06:19.205 --> 06:20.339
<i>Why they wanna do this</i>

06:20.406 --> 06:22.908
in the middle of the
damn night's beyond me.

06:22.975 --> 06:24.343
I'm getting too old for this.

06:25.511 --> 06:27.079
When they said "Vegas,"

06:27.146 --> 06:29.215
this is not
what I was expecting.

06:33.385 --> 06:36.788
<i>Hey, Kirby, I'm putting
the president's office through</i>

06:36.855 --> 06:41.093
<i>to Agent Messina
on a secure line.</i>

06:41.160 --> 06:43.262
<i>Agent Messina
was a rookie,</i>

06:43.329 --> 06:47.066
<i>but she was the expert
on Elvis Presley.</i>

06:52.271 --> 06:53.939
Yes, sir?

06:54.006 --> 06:56.976
Yes, Mr. President,
he's right here.

06:58.911 --> 07:00.546
He's ready to rock.

07:01.914 --> 07:04.416
Yes, he's ready to rock-n-roll.

07:05.584 --> 07:06.585
Um...

07:06.652 --> 07:09.121
Yes, I understand,
Mr. President.

07:10.089 --> 07:11.290
We'll do it, sir.

07:17.296 --> 07:19.365
Hello, sir.

07:19.431 --> 07:22.101
Just wanted to say that
I'm proud of what you're doing

07:22.167 --> 07:24.270
for our Roswell project.

07:24.336 --> 07:28.474
We look forward to your
continued cooperation.

07:28.540 --> 07:31.110
I wanted to tell ya
that I am a big fan

07:31.176 --> 07:32.444
<i>and so are my daughters.</i>

07:32.511 --> 07:35.614
Thank you, Mr. President.
Thank you very much.

07:40.653 --> 07:43.222
Mr. Burrows, as you know,

07:43.289 --> 07:47.026
we are in communication
with your friends.

07:48.060 --> 07:49.962
Why did you come back?

07:50.029 --> 07:52.097
We had an agreement,

07:52.164 --> 07:54.466
and we thought
you were happy up there.

07:59.338 --> 08:00.639
<i>We made clear that</i>

08:00.706 --> 08:03.475
<i>this is most uncomfortable
for us.</i>

08:03.542 --> 08:05.411
We want you to take him back.

08:06.612 --> 08:09.048
<i>We will not.</i>

08:09.481 --> 08:10.582
And why not?

08:11.950 --> 08:15.254
<i>It is his wish to see his child.</i>

08:15.321 --> 08:17.389
<i>To hell with his wishes!</i>

08:20.192 --> 08:22.561
<i>They were supposed
to be going to Vegas,</i>

08:22.628 --> 08:24.830
<i>but they drove right through.</i>

08:26.365 --> 08:30.135
<i>Elvis started to feel
a little uneasy.</i>

08:36.308 --> 08:38.277
Has the Linda
meeting been set up?

08:38.344 --> 08:41.447
Not yet, the chief
will explain that to you.

08:56.462 --> 08:58.530
<i>It was a
simple little building,</i>

08:58.597 --> 09:02.434
<i>way off the road,
you'd barely notice it,</i>

09:02.501 --> 09:06.372
<i>but it had levels that
went deep underground,</i>

09:06.438 --> 09:10.476
<i>some people say
like 15 floors down.</i>

09:10.542 --> 09:15.581
<i>Deep into the bedrock
of the mountains.</i>

09:15.647 --> 09:19.718
<i>They say government scientists
had alien bodies down there</i>

09:19.785 --> 09:22.254
<i>and they did experiments.</i>

09:22.321 --> 09:25.624
<i>When Area 51 closed down,
the government just moved</i>

09:25.691 --> 09:30.162
<i>all of that stuff out there
and called it Area 52.</i>

09:31.497 --> 09:34.233
I'm all the way
down here on level 10.

09:35.367 --> 09:37.469
This place gives me the creeps.

09:37.536 --> 09:40.272
And don't even talk about
what's in those labs.

09:41.640 --> 09:44.610
I thought I saw a head
in a cabinet the other day.

09:50.682 --> 09:54.353
We can't just let you
wander around freely.

09:54.420 --> 09:56.555
I'm afraid you'll be
considered under house arrest

09:56.622 --> 09:58.524
until further notice.

09:58.590 --> 10:01.260
Wait a minute,
this is not part of the mission.

10:01.326 --> 10:03.762
We're supposed to
simply communicate.

10:03.830 --> 10:05.397
We have orders, Messina,

10:05.464 --> 10:07.199
orders which you
are not privy to.

10:07.266 --> 10:08.267
Now stay out of this,

10:08.333 --> 10:10.669
and don't ever
question me again.

10:10.736 --> 10:13.038
Is that clear?

10:13.105 --> 10:14.673
<i>Now she
was in over her head,</i>

10:14.740 --> 10:18.343
<i>but, she had a job to do,
and she was gonna do it.</i>

10:19.812 --> 10:23.549
<i>Now, the guys at the top
had bigger problems.</i>

10:25.184 --> 10:27.653
Do you know they
sent in the freakin' Chairman?

10:27.719 --> 10:28.987
<i>What?</i>

10:29.054 --> 10:29.721
Now, what in the hell
could be going on out here

10:29.788 --> 10:30.989
in the middle of nowhere

10:31.056 --> 10:33.625
that they need to send
in the damn Chairman?

10:37.129 --> 10:40.365
He's upstairs, I gotta go.

10:54.346 --> 10:55.347
Our little friends at Roswell

10:55.414 --> 10:58.217
are full of some
pretty neat tricks.

10:58.283 --> 11:00.719
True, but we've known
that for some time.

11:00.786 --> 11:04.590
<i>Of course, the aliens
knew all about Area 52.</i>

11:06.191 --> 11:10.762
<i>They'd gone there long ago
to see what the CIA was up to.</i>

11:10.830 --> 11:14.099
<i>They'd gone over every inch
of that place,</i>

11:14.166 --> 11:16.602
<i>and had cameras everywhere.</i>

11:29.381 --> 11:32.618
So, what now, sir,
we just keep him here forever?

11:32.684 --> 11:34.186
No, no, no.

11:34.253 --> 11:36.321
I tell you what, we phone home,

11:36.388 --> 11:41.093
we tell our friends we wanna
return the package ASAP.

11:41.159 --> 11:42.227
All right,
you heard the man,

11:42.294 --> 11:43.729
let's get back to work.

11:43.795 --> 11:47.366
<i>The other agents
closed ranks.</i>

11:47.432 --> 11:49.869
<i>Messina felt the chill.</i>

11:55.374 --> 11:58.443
His presence here
is potentially disastrous!

11:58.510 --> 12:01.881
<i>He is entitled to some time
on his own.</i>

12:01.948 --> 12:04.650
<i>He was never a prisoner.</i>

12:04.716 --> 12:11.323
<i>I believe your people call it
a karmic imperative.</i>

12:11.390 --> 12:13.425
Karmic imperative?

12:13.492 --> 12:16.562
<i>He needed some time at home.</i>

12:18.330 --> 12:20.699
Damn this thing!

12:20.766 --> 12:25.671
<i>I hate supercilious aliens
from Alpha Centauri.</i>

12:25.737 --> 12:28.140
<i>There's just
something about them.</i>

12:33.412 --> 12:35.814
What now, sir?

12:35.882 --> 12:40.285
Well, we keep him confined
until further notice,

12:40.352 --> 12:42.287
we don't have any choice.

12:44.222 --> 12:45.424
<i>Baba Duece!</i>

12:47.659 --> 12:49.896
<i>Probably break the safe, man.</i>

12:51.763 --> 12:53.866
<i>Give it up for JJ Fatmac</i>

12:53.933 --> 12:56.201
<i>so big they call him Falvis</i>

12:56.268 --> 12:57.870
<i>Right to the balls then, huh?</i>

13:06.745 --> 13:11.583
Tompkins, please admit
the lovely Agent Messina.

13:11.650 --> 13:14.620
- Yes, sir.
- She's cleared to deliver lunch.

13:31.269 --> 13:32.404
Hungry?

13:37.309 --> 13:38.810
Is there anything you need?

13:51.423 --> 13:52.758
Yes, sir, all set.

13:52.824 --> 13:55.761
Monitor the cell at all times,
do not leave my post,

13:55.828 --> 13:59.932
and notify you of any
status changes ASAP, sir.

14:03.970 --> 14:05.537
<i>But as it turned out,</i>

14:05.604 --> 14:07.907
<i>Agent Messina
had some friends of her own.</i>

14:11.044 --> 14:13.880
<i>Untraceable, invisible,</i>

14:13.946 --> 14:16.748
<i>and highly reliable friends.</i>

14:20.086 --> 14:22.521
Well, how's my
favorite secret agent?

14:22.587 --> 14:24.823
Hi, Folger, long time no speak.

14:24.891 --> 14:26.692
Listen, I need a favor from you.

14:26.758 --> 14:28.460
Kiddo,

14:28.527 --> 14:30.429
<i>you saved my life back
in that Pakistan nightmare.</i>

14:30.495 --> 14:32.531
I still owe you big time.

14:33.598 --> 14:36.702
Have you heard
of Project King: Memphis Rising?

14:36.768 --> 14:39.604
<i>Well, I'm a part
of it, sort of.</i>

14:41.074 --> 14:42.340
I'm not in the loop.

14:42.407 --> 14:44.944
Messina, my dear,
if there was something called

14:45.011 --> 14:49.381
Project King: Memphis Rising,
I'd know about it.

14:49.448 --> 14:51.316
Would you?

14:51.383 --> 14:54.653
<i>Two Irishmen are
walking past a pub in Dublin,</i>

14:54.720 --> 14:56.421
<i>it could happen, you know?</i>

14:56.488 --> 14:57.622
<i>Huh?</i>

14:59.992 --> 15:02.294
<i>Oh, god.</i>

15:02.360 --> 15:04.596
<i>I'm sick.</i>

15:07.466 --> 15:09.001
<i>Something is happening.</i>

15:09.068 --> 15:11.636
<i>Somebody, somebody, help me.</i>

15:12.738 --> 15:16.775
Tompkins, check on him,
something's wrong.

15:17.143 --> 15:18.911
Yes, sir.

15:18.978 --> 15:20.479
I'll check on him right away.

15:26.152 --> 15:28.888
Tompkins, Tompkins.

15:44.770 --> 15:47.073
Working with the
United States government?

15:47.140 --> 15:48.507
Elvis?

15:49.674 --> 15:51.978
Folger, can you do
some digging for me?

15:52.044 --> 15:53.445
I'm an ex-spy, dear.

15:53.512 --> 15:57.282
But according to the plate
on the door a bit of a big shot.

16:03.822 --> 16:04.957
Come on.

16:05.024 --> 16:07.392
Do you have any idea
what you're involved in?

16:07.459 --> 16:09.494
I do.

16:09.561 --> 16:12.131
"Project King:
Memphis Rising."

16:12.198 --> 16:15.634
Initiated August 16, 1977.

16:15.700 --> 16:18.838
The clandestine removal
of the dying Elvis Presley.

16:18.905 --> 16:22.641
A substitute corpse planted
in Graceland mansion.

16:22.707 --> 16:27.013
And then subsequent transfer
to the Roswellian collective

16:27.079 --> 16:31.650
founded on September 1, 1946.

16:31.716 --> 16:35.453
Then by saucer
to the planet Gleedus.

16:35.520 --> 16:37.056
Let me save you
from further reading.

16:37.123 --> 16:39.025
I'm a part of the unit
that was supposed to meet

16:39.091 --> 16:42.427
the reconstituted essence
of the late Elvis Presley,

16:42.494 --> 16:46.631
code name JB, at a location
not far from Las Vegas, Nevada

16:46.698 --> 16:47.666
for reasons that are
further classified,

16:47.732 --> 16:49.434
et cetera, et cetera.

16:49.501 --> 16:50.635
What do you want me to do?

16:50.702 --> 16:52.671
The King is back, Folger.

16:52.737 --> 16:54.706
We have a rogue operation
within the company

16:54.773 --> 16:56.441
that is trying to contain him.

16:56.508 --> 16:59.411
<i>Again, for national
security purposes.</i>

17:19.165 --> 17:22.134
You have a good night, sir, huh.

17:23.635 --> 17:25.537
But JB's gonna need some help.

17:25.604 --> 17:27.739
Can I ask you for another favor?

17:27.806 --> 17:29.075
Name it.

17:29.141 --> 17:30.843
Round up his old crew.

17:30.910 --> 17:34.013
<i>Friends, band mates,
bodyguards, anyone.</i>

17:37.649 --> 17:40.119
I'll do a global, but why?

17:41.553 --> 17:43.588
Listen, I need to call you back.

17:43.655 --> 17:44.991
I'll talk to you later.

17:58.070 --> 17:59.771
Space aliens?

18:17.290 --> 18:20.092
Sir, something's happened.

18:20.159 --> 18:24.063
He was sick,
Tompkins opened the door,

18:24.130 --> 18:26.098
and the whole system went dead.

18:27.833 --> 18:30.069
Tompkins is
no longer responding.

18:31.203 --> 18:33.105
I can't reach anybody.

18:34.840 --> 18:36.976
We have no backup, sir.

18:40.112 --> 18:42.014
It's so dark down here.

18:45.251 --> 18:46.685
Freeze, JB.

18:47.119 --> 18:48.220
Now what?

18:48.287 --> 18:49.654
Now...

18:51.589 --> 18:53.059
get the hell outta here.

18:59.731 --> 19:01.666
<i>So that's how Elvis escaped</i>

19:01.733 --> 19:03.135
<i>from the CIA.</i>

19:10.775 --> 19:12.945
<i>Vegas is a tough town,</i>

19:13.012 --> 19:15.814
<i>and I was mixed up
with some of the toughest.</i>

19:20.353 --> 19:23.588
<i>I owed money to Big Little Joey.</i>

19:23.655 --> 19:26.959
<i>Joey was a bully
and a bottom feeder.</i>

19:27.026 --> 19:30.695
<i>You could always find him
at the cheapest place in town</i>

19:30.762 --> 19:32.999
<i>making everybody miserable.</i>

19:33.966 --> 19:35.835
Let me see
just what I'm paying for.

19:35.901 --> 19:37.303
- Oh, that'll cost you extra.
- Come on.

19:37.370 --> 19:39.238
Hey, don't worry about nothing,
you're gonna get your money.

19:39.305 --> 19:40.172
Now, let me see.

19:40.239 --> 19:41.874
- Take off your top!
- Ow!

19:43.409 --> 19:45.945
Ho, and you do mama, you do.

19:46.012 --> 19:48.613
Okay, sweetie, come on up here
a little higher.

19:48.680 --> 19:50.316
<i>And I wasn't worried,</i>

19:50.383 --> 19:53.319
<i>I knew I had the contest
sewn up.</i>

19:53.386 --> 19:54.854
<i>All the people loved me.</i>

19:57.655 --> 20:00.525
<i>It was gonna be
just like last year.</i>

20:01.726 --> 20:03.929
<i>All the usual players.</i>

20:04.696 --> 20:06.631
<i>Liberty Rocket was back,</i>

20:06.698 --> 20:09.168
<i>he was mostly in it
for the clothes.</i>

20:09.235 --> 20:13.039
<i>For Big El, it was really
all about the dance.</i>

20:14.739 --> 20:20.079
<i>And of course, JJ Harris,
back and bigger than ever.</i>

20:21.780 --> 20:23.883
<i>Yeah, he was an emotional wreck,</i>

20:23.949 --> 20:25.750
<i>and binge eating.</i>

20:25.817 --> 20:28.020
JJ what are you doing?

20:28.087 --> 20:31.190
<i>But the mob was
putting pressure on Joey,</i>

20:31.257 --> 20:34.860
<i>and Joey was loving
putting the squeeze on me.</i>

20:34.927 --> 20:37.163
Come on, come on, baby, come on.

20:37.229 --> 20:39.899
Yeah, oh yeah, ho, ho, ho.

20:39.965 --> 20:41.934
Oh, you got hands.
Oh, you've got some hands.

20:42.001 --> 20:43.701
Yeah, go for it, baby.

20:43.768 --> 20:45.337
Morning, sweetheart.

20:45.404 --> 20:47.006
Hi, baby.

20:47.073 --> 20:49.774
Uh-oh, sweet touch.

20:52.845 --> 20:55.214
All right, let's go Scissors,
before I lose my temper.

20:57.316 --> 21:00.119
<i>So I had to win
to pay off those thugs</i>

21:00.186 --> 21:04.023
<i>and get Joey off my back
once and for all.</i>

21:05.024 --> 21:06.425
Bastard!

21:06.492 --> 21:08.726
<i>So that's how I got so into it.</i>

21:10.329 --> 21:13.065
<i>It wasn't just
another Elvis contest,</i>

21:13.132 --> 21:16.235
<i>this one was for everything.</i>

21:18.736 --> 21:23.909

<i>and she loved Elvis

21:59.445 --> 22:02.780
- Thank you very much.
- Mm, looking sharp, gentlemen.

22:02.848 --> 22:05.284
Ooh, I'm sorry ma'am, I'm sorry.

22:05.351 --> 22:06.751
I'm sorry.

22:06.818 --> 22:07.785

22:07.853 --> 22:08.686
I'm fine,
I do that all the time.

22:08.753 --> 22:11.157
I'm kinda like a klutz queen.

22:11.223 --> 22:13.092
- I see.
- Sorry.

22:13.159 --> 22:14.460
It's okay.

22:14.527 --> 22:15.693
Sorry, fellas.

22:15.760 --> 22:18.430
I'm on the list, ma'am,
name is John Burrows.

22:20.966 --> 22:22.734
Uh, your name
is not on the list, sir,

22:22.800 --> 22:24.403
and registration
is almost closed.

22:24.470 --> 22:27.873
I don't understand,
there must be some mistake.

22:27.940 --> 22:29.575
One moment.

22:29.642 --> 22:32.945
<i>Now, Jackie knew
JB's name was on the list,</i>

22:34.013 --> 22:35.848
<i>she was holding the list.</i>

22:39.418 --> 22:42.221
- JB.
- Yes ma'am.

22:42.288 --> 22:46.125
Looks like you're all set.
Good luck, Mr. Burrows.

22:46.192 --> 22:49.895

Let's hear it, ladies
and gentlemen, the Big M,

23:20.292 --> 23:24.363
last year's 1970's Elvis
World Crown Champion.

23:26.131 --> 23:29.969
Remember, here,
Elvis is always in the building.

23:30.035 --> 23:32.371
And we have the best pay out
slots on the strip.

23:32.438 --> 23:37.409
So, as always,
have a good and lucky night.

23:45.618 --> 23:47.152
<i>He couldn't believe it,</i>

23:47.886 --> 23:49.188
<i>he was in Vegas,</i>

23:50.222 --> 23:51.257
<i>again.</i>

23:53.259 --> 23:55.995
<i>He wondered if the
people he knew and loved</i>

23:56.061 --> 23:58.364
<i>would be able to recognize him.</i>

24:02.434 --> 24:04.036
<i>Would Linda accept him?</i>

24:06.438 --> 24:07.973
<i>Would the fans?</i>

24:09.908 --> 24:11.477
<i>He just didn't know.</i>

24:18.183 --> 24:20.319
<i>Once, he ruled this town,</i>

24:21.153 --> 24:23.122
<i>now, he was a stranger.</i>

24:24.123 --> 24:26.258
<i>It felt like a dream,</i>

24:26.325 --> 24:29.061
<i>and soon. it would be over.</i>

24:41.407 --> 24:44.476
We had some of our best
people on the job, sir.

24:44.543 --> 24:47.246
Tompkins is a damn black belt.

24:47.313 --> 24:50.082
Excuse me, a black belt, sir.

24:51.083 --> 24:53.552
We felt certain
we had JB contained.

24:53.619 --> 24:56.388
Yeah, but now,
he's loose on the world

24:57.189 --> 24:59.458
very good work, Chief.

24:59.525 --> 25:03.162
Allow me to applaud your...
How should I put it?

25:03.228 --> 25:05.497
Glacial progress in this matter.

25:05.564 --> 25:09.568
Sir, we feel that we will
have him in custody shortly.

25:09.635 --> 25:13.272
Our resources are already
at work on it now.

25:13.339 --> 25:15.507
Well,
since we can kill a sparrow

25:15.574 --> 25:17.309
with a suborbital satellite,

25:17.376 --> 25:20.412
our resources better
be pretty damn good.

25:21.347 --> 25:24.416
<i>Their resources stank.</i>

25:24.483 --> 25:28.053
<i>The CIA didn't know
where Elvis was,</i>

25:28.120 --> 25:29.855
<i>but the aliens did.</i>

25:31.990 --> 25:33.859
<i>He was in Vegas, baby.</i>

25:39.598 --> 25:42.067
<i>He loved the feel
of real gravity</i>

25:42.134 --> 25:44.870
<i>and breathing
the cool, desert night air.</i>

25:46.238 --> 25:49.041
<i>Right here, right now.</i>

25:49.108 --> 25:51.543
<i>Being alive felt amazing.</i>

25:53.545 --> 25:59.084
<i>He was flying, he was home,
it was Vegas,</i>

25:59.151 --> 26:00.652
<i>and he was The King.</i>

26:07.426 --> 26:10.996
<i>And tonight
on "Your Vegas News at 11,"</i>

26:11.063 --> 26:13.599
<i>it's Barry from "Barry Live!"</i>

26:13.665 --> 26:15.067
<i>He's here in Vegas</i>

26:15.134 --> 26:19.405
<i>to host the 1970's Elvis
World Crown Competition,</i>

26:19.471 --> 26:22.608
<i>with an unheard
of half million dollar prize.</i>

26:22.674 --> 26:24.243
<i>Coming up next.</i>

26:24.309 --> 26:26.612
Barry, can you give us
a statement?

26:26.678 --> 26:29.114
I am honored that
they've asked me back

26:29.181 --> 26:31.049
to host the 1970's Elvis
World Crown Competition

26:31.116 --> 26:32.351
once again this year.

26:32.418 --> 26:36.255
All of these performers,
they truly love The King.

26:36.321 --> 26:39.625
And this is how they chose
to remember him,

26:39.691 --> 26:41.727
as a vibrant, powerful singer.

26:41.794 --> 26:44.196
And a world class showman.

26:44.263 --> 26:45.697
I'm proud to be a part of it.

26:45.764 --> 26:48.500
Barry, this
event goes on for four days,

26:48.567 --> 26:51.003
will you be covering
it on your show?

26:51.069 --> 26:53.472
You bet, tune in tomorrow,

and this is the biggest prize

26:58.477 --> 27:00.279
that's ever been
offered in the category.

27:00.345 --> 27:02.614
And well, we're expecting
a lot of excitement.

<i>Stay tuned</i>

<i>The next morning,</i>

27:10.122 --> 27:13.058
<i>the CIA must've been
watching "Barry Live!"</i>

27:13.125 --> 27:16.361
<i>I'm sure they were
just loving it.</i>

27:16.428 --> 27:18.397
<i>Imagine, they couldn't control</i>

27:18.464 --> 27:20.566
<i>what was coming
outta Barry's mouth,</i>

27:20.632 --> 27:22.401
<i>it was live TV.</i>

27:22.468 --> 27:24.536
<i>It was just this crazy moment</i>

27:24.603 --> 27:27.272
<i>where they couldn't
touch anyone.</i>

27:50.329 --> 27:51.463
All this week we are in

27:51.530 --> 27:53.632
beautiful and exciting
Las Vegas, Nevada

27:53.699 --> 27:57.603
where I am so honored to be
here to host for the second time

27:57.669 --> 28:01.507
the 1970s Elvis World
Crown Competition.

28:01.573 --> 28:02.976
Now last night was
the opening ceremony

28:03.041 --> 28:06.745
where last year's winner,
Big M, a fantastic performer,

28:06.812 --> 28:09.147
kicked off
this year's competition

28:09.214 --> 28:13.218
for an incredible
$500,000 prize.

28:20.592 --> 28:24.496
Now some people ask me,
why focus on the 1970's Elvis?

28:24.563 --> 28:27.633
Well, it turns out that
among rabid Elvis fans,

28:27.699 --> 28:31.103
those last years were
some of The King's best.

28:31.169 --> 28:32.571
Because of the problems
he endured,

28:32.638 --> 28:37.109
it opened his heart in a way
that touched so many so deeply.

28:37.175 --> 28:41.246
So today, we wanna talk about
the cult of the '70s Elvis.

28:41.313 --> 28:43.315
It turns out that
when The King was,

28:43.382 --> 28:45.450
well, more king sized

28:45.517 --> 28:49.254
his fans loved him just the
same, and it's still true today.

28:49.321 --> 28:51.223
Take a look at some
of these contestants.

28:51.290 --> 28:54.293
It's hard to believe,
but women of all ages

28:54.359 --> 28:57.529
are here in Vegas to scream
and shout in celebration

28:57.596 --> 28:59.866
of these whale-sized
competitors.

28:59.933 --> 29:02.134
I believe that when it comes
to the memory of Elvis,

29:02.200 --> 29:06.805
Vegas loves and misses him
in an especially deep way.

29:06.873 --> 29:08.507
He will always be The King here.

29:08.574 --> 29:10.910
<i>And although the fans
were out last night,</i>

29:10.977 --> 29:13.345
later today,
we expect record crowds

29:13.412 --> 29:14.680
at the preliminary rounds

29:14.746 --> 29:17.482
where we'll see some old
favorites from years past.

29:17.549 --> 29:21.353
And some new talent out
to prove their The King of kings

29:21.420 --> 29:23.655
and take home that half
million dollar prize.

29:23.722 --> 29:25.090
<i>♪ C'mon, c'mon ♪</i>

29:29.494 --> 29:31.663
Are you the lady
we're supposed to see?

29:31.730 --> 29:34.901
I am, gentlemen,
have seat.

29:34.968 --> 29:38.270
<i>Agent Messina had
been doing her homework.</i>

29:38.337 --> 29:40.572
<i>First, she got her
man on the inside</i>

29:40.639 --> 29:43.342
<i>to find Elvis' old
security force,</i>

29:43.408 --> 29:45.912
<i>Sonny West and The Rock.</i>

29:45.979 --> 29:48.547
<i>And had them flown to Vegas.</i>

29:50.382 --> 29:55.187
<i>Now, she had to tell them
everything she knew about JB,</i>

29:55.253 --> 29:56.755
<i>and they had to believe her</i>

29:56.822 --> 29:59.658
<i>because she needed their help
to protect him.</i>

29:59.725 --> 30:03.528
<i>Elvis needed protection
from the CIA.</i>

30:03.595 --> 30:07.366
What I'm about to tell you
is gonna blow your mind.

30:09.568 --> 30:11.503
You're gonna have
to trust me on this.

30:13.605 --> 30:16.408
<i>So she told 'em
about the alien's ship,</i>

30:16.475 --> 30:18.777
<i>and how they
had kept Elvis alive,</i>

30:18.845 --> 30:21.246
<i>and how he was back.</i>

30:21.313 --> 30:23.749
<i>And the CIA
wasn't happy about it.</i>

30:23.815 --> 30:26.351
<i>He was about to go
onstage and sing,</i>

30:26.418 --> 30:28.888
<i>and they could go
see for themselves.</i>

30:28.955 --> 30:32.157
<i>If he ever needed 'em,
he needed 'em now.</i>

30:42.869 --> 30:44.670
You nervous, JB?

30:44.736 --> 30:46.505
Oh, not at all,

30:47.539 --> 30:49.976
but I do get butterflies
when I'm talking to you.

30:50.043 --> 30:52.611
Oh, you flatter me.

30:52.678 --> 30:53.846
Hmm. I'm trying.

30:53.913 --> 30:55.915
Hell, maybe we can have
a ginger ale later on.

30:55.982 --> 30:57.482
Talk about my nerves.

30:57.549 --> 31:00.185
I do tend to drink
a bit stronger.

35:19.111 --> 35:22.014
Hey, you good boy,
you real good.

35:24.616 --> 35:26.018
But you ain't gonna win.

35:27.119 --> 35:30.856
You see, I saw Elvis
in concert 13 times.

35:31.723 --> 35:32.724
Thirteen times.

35:32.791 --> 35:35.227
Yeah, and you got to
have the groove.

35:36.262 --> 35:40.299
Yeah, 13 times,

35:40.366 --> 35:42.101
If you'll excuse me, son,
I really gotta get going,

35:59.651 --> 36:03.621
Thirteen times, got to have
a groove, got to have a move.

36:03.688 --> 36:06.725
Not bad, I gotta admit it.

36:06.791 --> 36:07.893
Thanks, friend.

36:07.960 --> 36:10.729
I thought I was
a little bit rusty myself.

36:10.795 --> 36:12.131
I'll see you next time.

36:13.966 --> 36:16.701
How he'd come
outta nowhere and do that?

36:16.768 --> 36:19.238
If I were you,
I would just not worry.

36:19.305 --> 36:20.505
Hey, man.

36:21.974 --> 36:24.576
You know, I don't know
who you are,

36:24.642 --> 36:26.846
or where the hell you come from,

36:26.912 --> 36:30.182
but it's gonna be a good fight,
and I love a challenge.

36:31.417 --> 36:32.650
And let's just see
if you make it

36:32.717 --> 36:34.954

36:35.021 --> 36:36.521
Yeah, let's see.

36:39.158 --> 36:40.292
Hey, JB.

36:40.359 --> 36:41.760
But you kiss off the damn floor.

36:41.827 --> 36:43.728
- Oh, hi.
- Yeah, hi yourself.

36:43.795 --> 36:45.898
You know, those boys are right,
you're not bad,

36:45.965 --> 36:48.267
but you're not as good as me.

36:48.334 --> 36:50.269
Well, that's what
Big M said, too.

36:50.336 --> 36:51.837
A lotta modesty in this place.

36:51.904 --> 36:53.605
I ain't the modest
type son of a B.

36:53.671 --> 36:55.007
I mean, JB.

36:55.074 --> 36:57.009
No kidding,
you coulda fooled me.

36:57.076 --> 36:59.145
Yeah, laugh it up, funny boy.

36:59.211 --> 37:02.048
See what happens when the
chickens come home to roost.

37:04.783 --> 37:06.285
I thought you were
gonna stand me up.

37:07.853 --> 37:09.788
Mm-mm, I'm real thirsty.

37:09.855 --> 37:13.691
Oh. I'm kinda feeling
that way myself.

37:13.758 --> 37:15.061

38:44.850 --> 38:47.987
Wait a minute,
hold on a second, what?

38:48.053 --> 38:51.924
Unless we see you soon, JB,

38:51.991 --> 38:54.860
your daughter's gonna take
that long ride.

38:54.927 --> 38:56.295
And I don't mean to Gleedus.

38:56.362 --> 38:57.930
What are you talking about?

38:58.898 --> 39:00.065
My daughter?

39:00.499 --> 39:01.934
You come now,

39:02.902 --> 39:05.037
quickly and quietly,

39:05.938 --> 39:07.672
this all ends well.

39:09.508 --> 39:11.277
We're tired of this chase.

39:11.343 --> 39:14.346
You son of a bitch,
I can't believe this.

39:15.981 --> 39:18.284
Half an hour, here.

39:19.451 --> 39:21.353
Don't disappoint me.

39:21.420 --> 39:23.956
Are you calling to tell me
you've got my baby?

39:33.866 --> 39:36.936
JB, there's someone
here to see you.

39:37.002 --> 39:41.006
Agent Messina, this is Jackie.
Jackie, Agent Messina.

39:41.073 --> 39:42.707
Official government business.

39:43.242 --> 39:44.877
What's going on?

39:44.944 --> 39:47.012
I'll explain later, baby,
we'll be okay.

39:47.079 --> 39:48.380
Don't you worry about a thing.

39:50.082 --> 39:51.450
Will you excuse us?

39:51.517 --> 39:53.452
- Yeah.
- Just give us a minute.

39:57.957 --> 40:01.227
JB, you can't turn
yourself in right now.

40:01.293 --> 40:02.962
Quite frankly,
I am nervous

40:03.028 --> 40:05.130
about everything
that's going on.

40:05.197 --> 40:08.800
They have my daughter,
they have my baby.

40:08.867 --> 40:10.735
Your boss called
and said if I didn't...

40:11.303 --> 40:12.238
We have time.

40:13.405 --> 40:16.108
JB, you hold all
the cards right now.

40:16.175 --> 40:17.309
They have
your daughter,

40:17.376 --> 40:19.845
but you are in a very
public competition

40:19.912 --> 40:22.014
and they're not gonna
wanna cause a scene.

40:22.081 --> 40:24.883
Just do me a favor,
let me see what I can find out.

40:24.950 --> 40:28.120
And, please, just don't
do anything crazy.

40:28.187 --> 40:30.356
<i>He was dying
to do something,</i>

40:31.290 --> 40:32.291
<i>anything.</i>

40:33.859 --> 40:37.963
<i>Knowing the CIA
had Linda did make him crazy.</i>

40:38.030 --> 40:40.099
<i>At this point, he didn't know</i>

40:40.165 --> 40:42.767
<i>what those people
were capable of.</i>

40:47.106 --> 40:50.142
<i>But Agent Messina
said she had a plan.</i>

40:50.209 --> 40:52.177
<i>So she sent them off
to the local diner</i>

40:52.244 --> 40:54.446
<i>to wait further instructions.</i>

40:58.684 --> 41:00.052
Is it possible?

41:02.021 --> 41:05.190
Sonny West,
I can't believe my eyes.

41:09.928 --> 41:11.530
I gotta tell you something.

41:13.198 --> 41:17.303
I'm very sorry that I never
got to say goodbye to you.

41:17.369 --> 41:18.370
Yeah.

41:21.073 --> 41:24.143
I loved you, man, I missed you.

41:24.610 --> 41:26.879
Yeah, yeah.

41:26.945 --> 41:29.315
I know The Rock did, too.

41:29.381 --> 41:32.551
And when the curtain
comes down on the finalists,

41:34.620 --> 41:38.490
it's gonna make some big
headlines, you know that.

41:40.626 --> 41:43.829
It's like it's all over again,
this stuff starts all over.

41:45.064 --> 41:46.298

Yeah, yeah.

41:51.537 --> 41:54.573

right, Rock?

41:54.640 --> 41:55.974
Yeah.

41:56.041 --> 42:01.046
I'm gonna need real tight
security from here on out.

42:01.113 --> 42:02.281
It's gonna be something,

42:02.348 --> 42:04.450
it's gonna be a hell of a ride

42:04.516 --> 42:06.251

42:46.492 --> 42:50.129
This contest has certainly

42:50.195 --> 42:52.431
First of all, last night's

42:52.498 --> 42:54.166

43:01.206 --> 43:03.242
to wow the audiences last night.

43:03.308 --> 43:05.611
He seemed to actually
be Elvis at times

43:05.677 --> 43:09.982
as he took the stage and rocked
the house with authority.

43:10.048 --> 43:11.717
<i>This guy is amazing.</i>

43:11.784 --> 43:13.252
<i>I couldn't believe my eyes,</i>

43:13.318 --> 43:14.987
<i>and neither could
the sold out crowd</i>

43:15.053 --> 43:17.423
<i>who went wild for this new guy.</i>

43:17.489 --> 43:20.592
Sir, he's all over the TV,
he entered some contest

43:20.659 --> 43:23.729
at the Desert Sand Hotel,
and he's winning.

43:23.796 --> 43:28.133
Everybody's talking about it,
he's on "Barry Live!" now.

43:28.200 --> 43:31.403
On a sad note, a beloved
performer, Mr. JJ Harris,

43:31.470 --> 43:34.406
was spotted in this
exclusive cell phone video,

43:34.473 --> 43:36.542
as he attempted
to end his own life

43:36.608 --> 43:39.011
after seeing
Mr. Burrows perform.

43:39.077 --> 43:41.380
I'm heading home, pal,

43:41.447 --> 43:42.916
I ain't gonna win this thing.

43:43.749 --> 43:45.350
Not against JB.

43:46.418 --> 43:48.287
And I can't take the pain.

43:49.288 --> 43:51.423
Time to hold hands with Jesus.

43:51.490 --> 43:54.059
Come on, JJ, it's just a show.

43:54.126 --> 43:55.661
<i>♪ C'mon, c'mon ♪</i>

43:55.727 --> 43:59.164
Of course, with a cool
half mil in the balance,

43:59.231 --> 44:01.333
everyone is feeling
the pressure.

44:01.400 --> 44:04.169
Later today and tonight,
the competition continues

44:04.236 --> 44:08.040
with round after round
of fierce live performances.

44:08.106 --> 44:10.342
I have never seen
anything like it.

44:10.409 --> 44:12.277
So, be sure to tune in tomorrow

44:12.344 --> 44:15.747
for more about this epic
and historic competition.

44:15.814 --> 44:17.249
Coming up next,

44:17.316 --> 44:20.719
fan fashion and dining bargains
everyone should know about.

44:20.786 --> 44:23.055
Right here on "Barry Live!"

44:23.121 --> 44:24.356
We'll be right back.

44:26.258 --> 44:28.760
We got two of them there judges
in our pocket already.

44:28.828 --> 44:30.562
Yeah, we need to get rid
of this guy JB,

44:30.629 --> 44:33.098
and fast, he's drawing
too much attention.

44:33.165 --> 44:35.467
We don't need to do nothing
to JB, okay?

44:35.534 --> 44:36.668
I'm gonna win.

44:37.302 --> 44:38.537
I'm gonna win.

44:38.604 --> 44:42.641
Don't worry, I'm gonna get
you your money, somehow.

44:45.377 --> 44:47.479
And maybe I can place
a bet on tonight's game.

44:48.714 --> 44:51.116
Sure, you got great credit.

44:51.183 --> 44:53.619
Listen pal, we can't
take any chances

44:53.685 --> 44:56.221
and you should be happy
we're doing everything possible

44:56.288 --> 44:57.756
to see you're the champ.

44:59.491 --> 45:02.427
I wanna make it clear
to this putz,

45:02.494 --> 45:06.331
that he delivers or he dies!

45:06.398 --> 45:10.669
Are we're perfectly... clear
on this very simple point?

45:11.871 --> 45:14.673
Win or die, putz!

45:20.779 --> 45:22.814
Don't you worry about a thing,

45:22.882 --> 45:24.716
we're the good fellows here.

45:26.518 --> 45:30.355
He won't show up in Friday's
top 10, I guarantee it.

45:31.557 --> 45:33.358
Keep practicing.

45:33.425 --> 45:37.529
"Love Me Tender,"
"Viva Las Vegas."

45:39.398 --> 45:41.433
Hey, I love this shirt.

45:45.637 --> 45:48.440
<i>This was starting
to feel like a real nightmare.</i>

45:56.381 --> 45:58.216
<i>The guys were
all doing overtime</i>

45:58.283 --> 46:00.352
<i>trying to impress the fans.</i>

46:02.821 --> 46:06.291
<i>As I pulled up in the limo
and saw them there,</i>

46:06.358 --> 46:07.693
<i>I felt a glimmer of hope.</i>

46:07.759 --> 46:10.830
Big M, you're my man,
I love you!

46:10.897 --> 46:14.166
<i>It started
to feel like last year.</i>

46:14.232 --> 46:16.101
He's gonna make the finals.

46:16.903 --> 46:18.704
<i>They still loved me.</i>

46:27.446 --> 46:28.780
<i>I still had it.</i>

46:32.517 --> 46:34.620
<i>Until he stepped in.</i>

46:35.989 --> 46:38.357
JB is awesome!

46:39.424 --> 46:41.828
<i>It was
as if I'd disappeared.</i>

46:41.894 --> 46:45.797
<i>They were all over him,
and he was just eating it up.</i>

46:50.569 --> 46:53.405
<i>But every move was perfection.</i>

47:00.345 --> 47:01.848
Good luck, JB,
we look forward to seeing you

47:01.914 --> 47:03.682
during the duration
of the competition.

47:03.749 --> 47:04.783
Thank you very much.

47:06.251 --> 47:10.489
And the World Crown Elvis
event continues its momentum.

47:10.555 --> 47:13.792
I'm Lynn Martin reporting
from fabulous Las Vegas.

47:13.860 --> 47:17.295
Have a rocking, rolling,
hunk-a-burning loving afternoon.

47:28.074 --> 47:30.776
Well, you are
the front runner, JB,

47:30.843 --> 47:33.478
that's what the latest
news flash says.

47:33.545 --> 47:34.813
Well, I haven't
heard that myself,

47:34.881 --> 47:36.515
but I'll take your word for it.

47:36.581 --> 47:38.383
Come on, man, this ain't over.

47:38.450 --> 47:39.852
When I do "Blue Suede Shoes,"

47:39.919 --> 47:41.653
it's curtains for all you guys.

47:41.720 --> 47:44.389
Forget that, I got
a pair of Elvis shoes.

47:44.456 --> 47:47.759
I got it from Elvis'
Uncle Vester in Graceland.

47:47.827 --> 47:49.728
Now if that ain't luck,
I don't know what is.

47:53.866 --> 47:55.467
I got a pair of shoes
at the arena,

47:55.534 --> 47:58.437
April 1976, Long Beach.

47:58.503 --> 48:00.338
Hey, Big M, what's wrong,
where you going, man?

48:00.405 --> 48:02.207
You dudes are unbelievable.

48:03.341 --> 48:05.410
<i>My nerves were on edge.</i>

48:05.477 --> 48:08.848
<i>Big Little Joey
wasn't fooling around.</i>

48:08.915 --> 48:12.919
<i>And while JB seemed so cool,
all of the waiting for Linda</i>

48:12.985 --> 48:15.922
<i>was really starting
to get to him.</i>

48:16.755 --> 48:18.191
Excuse me.

48:47.385 --> 48:48.754
Who do you need to call?

48:48.820 --> 48:51.456
And old friend
in Washington D.C.

48:51.523 --> 48:53.258
In the music business?

48:54.160 --> 48:56.461
No, the spy business.

49:09.108 --> 49:10.809
Bobby?

49:12.611 --> 49:14.947
Is this really you, old friend?

49:15.014 --> 49:18.885
It is, you recognize
our special password.

49:18.951 --> 49:22.955
Well, no one else
knew about pelvis hell.

49:23.022 --> 49:25.892
But listen to me now,
I need your help.

49:25.958 --> 49:27.359
I'm down here
for just a short time,

49:27.425 --> 49:31.063
and some folks in your company
have grabbed my daughter.

49:32.098 --> 49:32.899
What?

49:32.965 --> 49:35.667
A rogue operation in my company?

49:35.734 --> 49:38.703
I'm afraid so, can you help?

49:39.471 --> 49:40.873
Do you trust me?

49:41.807 --> 49:43.408
Of course.

49:43.475 --> 49:45.710
Like I said,
some things never change.

49:46.478 --> 49:48.848
Good, got a pen and paper?

50:06.999 --> 50:09.801
<i>Sir, he's on the road
driving here now.</i>

50:10.236 --> 50:11.770
All right.

50:11.838 --> 50:14.739
Too risky
to nab him at the hotel,

50:14.806 --> 50:16.808
too damn much visibility.

50:16.876 --> 50:19.811
You know, the last thing we need
is a national scandal.

50:19.879 --> 50:24.416
<i>Exactly, sir,
that stupid contest.</i>

50:24.482 --> 50:26.551
<i>We couldn't get near him.</i>

50:26.618 --> 50:29.088
<i>The place is crawling
with press.</i>

50:29.989 --> 50:31.690
Dammed clever of him.

50:31.756 --> 50:35.161
<i>Even now, we'd
be smart to let him get back.</i>

50:35.228 --> 50:37.864
<i>He's gonna be missed
if he doesn't return.</i>

50:39.265 --> 50:41.600
Nonsense.

50:41.666 --> 50:44.837
Every second he's out there,
he's a liability.

50:44.904 --> 50:47.439
<i>That may be true, sir,
but trust me,</i>

50:47.505 --> 50:50.642
<i>keeping him alive
and keeping him controlled</i>

50:50.709 --> 50:52.377
<i>is gonna be a trick.</i>

51:02.721 --> 51:05.457
The car is approaching,
but he's not alone,

51:05.523 --> 51:08.693
the lovely Agent Messina
is in the vehicle.

51:08.760 --> 51:10.729
<i>She is most certainly armed.</i>

51:12.832 --> 51:14.699
What is she thinking?

51:15.868 --> 51:18.137
All units, pull back
to lower levels.

51:18.204 --> 51:21.974
I repeat, all units
to lower levels immediately.

51:22.041 --> 51:23.675
We have a code red.

51:41.693 --> 51:43.829
I gave this to her
when she was six.

51:45.831 --> 51:48.633
She's kept it all this time.

51:48.700 --> 51:51.003
I'm sorry, JB,
she was here when I left.

51:53.239 --> 51:54.439
What happened?

51:58.077 --> 51:59.412
We're gonna find her,

51:59.477 --> 52:02.114
we're gonna save the fight
for another day, let's go.

52:07.819 --> 52:09.188
We'll try again, JB.

52:09.255 --> 52:12.590
Next time, we'll bring in
your friends as reinforcements,

52:12.657 --> 52:13.658
I'll make some phone calls

52:13.725 --> 52:15.760
and see who else
we can get on board.

52:15.828 --> 52:17.263
Are they gonna hurt her?

52:17.330 --> 52:18.431
No, they're not gonna hurt her.

52:18.496 --> 52:20.099
They're just trying
to intimidate him.

52:24.203 --> 52:25.204
Yeah.

52:25.271 --> 52:27.039
Stay off the radar.

52:27.106 --> 52:30.142
You're persona non grata
and helping the enemy.

52:31.210 --> 52:32.744
Got it, thanks.

52:34.013 --> 52:35.114
How's The King?

52:35.181 --> 52:37.450
Oh, he's holding up,
we'll talk later.

52:39.118 --> 52:40.152
Who was that?

52:41.120 --> 52:42.254
That was just a friend.

52:43.588 --> 52:47.927
Next time, when we go in,
it'll be on our terms.

52:47.994 --> 52:49.061
How?

52:49.128 --> 52:51.097
I'm working on that.

52:51.163 --> 52:53.866
Don't you have
a competition to win?

52:53.933 --> 52:55.600
How can you think
of that right now?

52:55.667 --> 52:57.769
Does it really
matter all that much?

52:58.938 --> 53:00.572
<i>Now, that was
when Jackie realized</i>

53:00.638 --> 53:04.176
<i>that JB didn't care about
winning the contest,</i>

53:05.945 --> 53:07.847
<i>he cared about her.</i>

53:13.252 --> 53:16.688
<i>Coming up next
on "The Mona Winters Show,"</i>

53:16.755 --> 53:19.258
<i>Elvis is in the building.</i>

53:19.325 --> 53:21.093
<i>Mona talks</i>

53:21.160 --> 53:25.865
<i>to 1970's Elvis World Crown
Competition front runner,</i>

53:25.931 --> 53:28.067
<i>Mr. John Burrows.</i>

53:28.134 --> 53:29.768
<i>Suddenly,
it seemed like JB</i>

53:29.835 --> 53:32.004
<i>was on every channel.</i>

53:32.071 --> 53:35.274
<i>He did in a few days
what it had taken the rest of us</i>

53:35.341 --> 53:37.143
<i>years to achieve.</i>

53:37.209 --> 53:39.011
So tell me JB,

53:39.078 --> 53:42.014
how long have you been
an Elvis impersonator?

53:43.349 --> 53:45.217
<i>A couple years, ma'am,</i>

53:45.284 --> 53:47.786
<i>by the way, thank you so much
for having me on this show.</i>

53:47.853 --> 53:49.554
<i>I know I'm kinda
the new boy in town.</i>

53:49.621 --> 53:52.892
<i>I see you have a few friends
in the champ circuit.</i>

53:54.460 --> 53:57.863
What did you do before
you were an Elvis impersonator?

53:57.930 --> 54:00.698
<i>I was in production,</i>

54:00.765 --> 54:02.835
<i>you know,
behind the scenes, ma'am.</i>

54:02.902 --> 54:05.071
<i>Unseen hands, so to speak.</i>

54:05.137 --> 54:06.805
<i>Do you think
you'll win the contest?</i>

54:06.872 --> 54:09.108
<i>I'm just happy to be
singing again, you know, uh,</i>

54:09.175 --> 54:12.078
<i>for fans
who appreciate my music.</i>

54:12.144 --> 54:15.814
<i>Now, some still believe
Elvis is alive.</i>

54:15.881 --> 54:17.950
Do you believe that?

54:18.017 --> 54:19.717
<i>Well, anything
is possible, Mona.</i>

54:19.784 --> 54:22.821
<i>There are many, many mysteries
in heaven and Earth.</i>

54:23.788 --> 54:24.990
<i>I guess.</i>

54:25.057 --> 54:28.194
<i>Well, I wish you luck, JB.</i>

54:28.260 --> 54:30.896
<i>I mean, Elvis.</i>

54:30.963 --> 54:33.265
<i>That was JB,
one of the finalists this week</i>

54:33.332 --> 54:37.002
in the 1970's Elvis
World Crown Championship.

54:37.069 --> 54:39.305
Stay tuned, we'll be right back.

54:40.873 --> 54:42.074
Thank you, JB.

54:45.144 --> 54:48.247
So I don't know, Mickey,
you really think I can beat JB?

54:49.348 --> 54:52.351
Listen to me, old friend,
on Sunday night,

54:52.418 --> 54:55.888
you upstage him, simple as that.

54:55.955 --> 54:58.257
But he's good, Mickey.
He's real good.

54:58.324 --> 55:01.227
JB is good, even great,

55:01.293 --> 55:03.628
but he's not Elvis,
for God sakes.

55:05.364 --> 55:07.632
Sometimes, I think he is Elvis.

55:11.036 --> 55:14.473
Ladies and gentlemen
welcome to the semi-finals.

55:14.540 --> 55:17.042
Tonight, we have
the top 10 finalists

55:17.109 --> 55:19.011
right here performing
on this stage for you.

55:19.078 --> 55:21.981
Later on this evening,
we're gonna pick the top four

55:22.047 --> 55:24.083
to perform for you on this stage

55:24.150 --> 55:26.252
where in the 1970s
Elvis Presley himself

55:26.318 --> 55:27.453
performed many times.

55:27.520 --> 55:29.889
So, ladies and gentlemen,
without delay,

55:29.955 --> 55:30.923
I'd like to introduce to you

55:30.990 --> 55:33.392
the pride
of the Graceland mafia.

55:33.459 --> 55:39.064

Hello everybody, and welcome,
welcome to "Barry Live!"

1:00:42.601 --> 1:00:46.104
And I am so excited
to give you the latest

1:00:46.171 --> 1:00:51.443
on the 1970's
Elvis World Crown Competition!

1:00:52.544 --> 1:00:53.979
<i>What Elvis didn't know</i>

1:00:54.046 --> 1:00:56.181
<i>was that Joey
put that girl there.</i>

1:00:56.248 --> 1:00:57.449
- Hey, how ya doing?
- You look like.

1:00:57.516 --> 1:00:59.184
- Can I get your autograph?
- You got a paper?

1:00:59.251 --> 1:01:00.586
I got something
for you right here.

1:01:00.652 --> 1:01:02.387
<i>And what
Joey didn't know was...</i>

1:01:03.388 --> 1:01:06.658
<i>the power of Elvis in a biosuit.</i>

1:01:07.192 --> 1:01:08.193
Ow!

1:01:15.534 --> 1:01:17.402
Sorry, honey, I'll just
get you that autograph later.

1:01:20.305 --> 1:01:22.307
- Hey, guys.
- We're Homeland Security.

1:01:22.374 --> 1:01:24.309
We're Homeland Security.

1:01:24.376 --> 1:01:26.378
What do you work out
in Las Vegas?

1:01:26.445 --> 1:01:29.348
As you know,
we have been closely following

1:01:29.414 --> 1:01:32.351
the dark horse candidate,
Mr. John Burrows.

1:01:32.417 --> 1:01:34.486
Yesterday, I showed you
some clips

1:01:34.553 --> 1:01:36.221
of his electrifying performance.

1:01:36.288 --> 1:01:39.358
We are all just getting
to know this competitor,

1:01:39.424 --> 1:01:41.159
and finding out about
him has turned out

1:01:41.226 --> 1:01:44.096
to be a lot harder than
anyone imagined.

1:01:44.162 --> 1:01:46.231
My staff has been
working overtime

1:01:46.298 --> 1:01:49.334
trying to find out
the 4-1-1 on this fan favorite.

1:01:49.401 --> 1:01:52.437
For instance, yesterday
on "The Mona Winters Show,"

1:01:52.504 --> 1:01:55.474
this is what he had
to say when Mona

1:01:55.541 --> 1:01:58.744
asked John Burrows
what he used to do.

1:01:58.810 --> 1:02:01.413
<i>I was in production,</i>

1:02:01.480 --> 1:02:03.749
<i>you know,
behind the scenes, ma'am.</i>

1:02:03.815 --> 1:02:05.584
<i>Unseen hands, so to speak.</i>

1:02:05.651 --> 1:02:07.753
So we got our people
on it last night,

1:02:07.819 --> 1:02:10.656
and here's what we found.

1:02:10.722 --> 1:02:13.792
We couldn't find out anything
about this mystery man.

1:02:13.860 --> 1:02:17.462
He has no birth certificates,
no work record,

1:02:17.529 --> 1:02:21.767
no graduations, or arrests,
or marriages, or photographs.

1:02:21.834 --> 1:02:23.735
He is a man without a past.

1:02:23.802 --> 1:02:27.306
Ladies and gentlemen, this is
not what we expected to find,

1:02:27.372 --> 1:02:29.341
but, it is what it is.

1:02:29.408 --> 1:02:31.643
And we here at "Barry Live!"
are committed

1:02:31.710 --> 1:02:34.813
to bringing the facts to you,
our viewing audience.

1:02:34.881 --> 1:02:36.648
And coming up next,

1:02:36.715 --> 1:02:39.151
is John Burrows
simply the stage name

1:02:39.217 --> 1:02:40.887
of this man from nowhere,

1:02:40.954 --> 1:02:43.322
or is it something else?

1:02:43.388 --> 1:02:45.357

1:07:48.094 --> 1:07:51.463
that Mona Winters

1:07:51.529 --> 1:07:54.000

to tell us
about their life and times,

1:08:17.622 --> 1:08:21.726
today, we have a man who has
nothing to say about himself.

why don't they tell us?

1:10:17.843 --> 1:10:18.878
That's right.

1:10:18.944 --> 1:10:20.179
What's this all about?

1:10:20.812 --> 1:10:22.248
Two words, son.

1:10:23.182 --> 1:10:24.783
National security.

1:10:24.850 --> 1:10:26.385
I don't understand.

1:10:26.452 --> 1:10:29.388
<i>Your presence here
is a real liability.</i>

1:10:29.455 --> 1:10:31.556
<i>You betrayed me, Bobby.</i>

1:10:32.391 --> 1:10:33.926
<i>You're one of them.</i>

1:10:33.993 --> 1:10:36.962
<i>Oh, hell, I've always
been one of them.</i>

1:10:38.431 --> 1:10:43.335
King, look, do you realize
the knowledge that you possess?

1:10:43.402 --> 1:10:46.105
I mean, the people
you once knew.

1:10:46.172 --> 1:10:49.975
Richard Nixon,
the whole Vietnam thing.

1:10:50.042 --> 1:10:54.113
Area 51, and countless
clandestine operations.

1:10:54.180 --> 1:10:57.917
Many of which, are still today,
highly classified.

1:10:57.983 --> 1:10:59.418
You can trust me.
I won't say a thing

1:10:59.485 --> 1:11:01.087
to anybody about anything.

1:11:01.153 --> 1:11:04.857
Out of my hands,
bottom line is, you're here.

1:11:04.924 --> 1:11:08.828
And now, we'd like you
to tell your Roswellian friends

1:11:08.894 --> 1:11:12.697
that you'll be a good hound dog
and head for home.

1:11:12.764 --> 1:11:14.300
I just need
a little bit of time, Bobby.

1:11:14.366 --> 1:11:16.001
I'm not gonna argue this thing.

1:11:16.068 --> 1:11:18.871
Either you do as I say, or...

1:11:19.771 --> 1:11:23.342
well, we've got
your little girl.

1:11:24.742 --> 1:11:26.811
I wanna see her now.

1:11:33.085 --> 1:11:34.086
Okay.

1:11:43.295 --> 1:11:44.296
Hi, baby.

1:11:44.964 --> 1:11:46.398
I don't know you.

1:12:04.782 --> 1:12:06.051
Let's go, JB.

1:12:17.229 --> 1:12:18.397
<i>Hi, baby.</i>

1:12:19.797 --> 1:12:21.300
<i>I don't know you.</i>

1:12:23.335 --> 1:12:25.271
She doesn't know him.

1:12:26.972 --> 1:12:29.041
His heart is breaking.

1:12:33.279 --> 1:12:34.513
Hey, Big M.

1:12:34.580 --> 1:12:36.814
Hey, Paulie,
usual for me, buddy,

1:12:36.882 --> 1:12:38.417
and whatever
my friend here wants.

1:12:38.484 --> 1:12:39.885
Right away.

1:12:40.818 --> 1:12:41.987
So...

1:12:43.155 --> 1:12:44.323
JB.

1:12:46.125 --> 1:12:48.693
Glad we could have
a chance to talk.

1:12:50.529 --> 1:12:52.198
Who in the hell are you?

1:12:53.265 --> 1:12:54.900
I've been doing this
a long time,

1:12:54.967 --> 1:12:57.102
a lot longer than the others,

1:12:57.169 --> 1:12:58.904
and I dedicated most
of my life to this,

1:12:58.971 --> 1:13:00.506
and I ain't never
heard of you, son.

1:13:00.573 --> 1:13:02.474
So come on, fess up.

1:13:02.541 --> 1:13:05.010
<i>And then he told me everything.</i>

1:13:05.578 --> 1:13:07.112
My name...

1:13:08.948 --> 1:13:11.250
is Elvis Presley.

1:13:11.317 --> 1:13:15.154
I was born in Tupelo,
Mississippi in 1935.

1:13:17.089 --> 1:13:19.992
<i>He told me about
the aliens and the biosuit.</i>

1:13:20.059 --> 1:13:21.961
<i>He told me
about the girl he had met</i>

1:13:22.027 --> 1:13:24.396
<i>at the dance back in 1959.</i>

1:13:24.463 --> 1:13:28.500
<i>And the secret they had
promised to keep, Linda.</i>

1:13:29.301 --> 1:13:31.303
She was my life.

1:13:31.370 --> 1:13:34.073
<i>And he told me
about how the CIA</i>

1:13:34.139 --> 1:13:36.575
<i>had kidnapped her, and how
he needed to make things</i>

1:13:36.642 --> 1:13:39.144
<i>right with her before he left.</i>

1:13:39.211 --> 1:13:41.146
<i>And then he smiled
when he told me</i>

1:13:41.213 --> 1:13:42.814
<i>about falling in love
with Jackie</i>

1:13:42.881 --> 1:13:47.219
<i>and how people here on Earth
had really come through for him.</i>

1:13:47.286 --> 1:13:50.755
<i>Like Agent Messina,
and Sonny, and The Rock.</i>

1:13:51.924 --> 1:13:54.126
<i>He knew
he didn't have much time.</i>

1:13:54.193 --> 1:13:57.029
<i>He knew he was risking his life.</i>

1:13:57.096 --> 1:13:59.331
<i>If he didn't get back
to the ship in time,</i>

1:13:59.398 --> 1:14:03.302
<i>the biosuit would fail,
and Elvis would die.</i>

1:14:04.637 --> 1:14:08.374
<i>Still, he was happy
because a crew of friends</i>

1:14:08.440 --> 1:14:11.510
<i>were on their way
to help him get Linda back.</i>

1:14:13.145 --> 1:14:16.315
<i>People that he loved
and that loved him.</i>

1:14:20.019 --> 1:14:21.987
Hey, Sonny.

1:14:22.054 --> 1:14:26.125
Holy mother of Memphis,
it's Sonny West.

1:14:26.191 --> 1:14:27.293
How would you like to go on

1:14:27.359 --> 1:14:29.962
a little adventure
of goodwill with me?

1:14:30.029 --> 1:14:32.264
What kind of adventure, King?

1:14:32.331 --> 1:14:35.634
Oh, one that involves a little
old fashioned butt kicking.

1:14:35.701 --> 1:14:37.403
Like the old days.

1:14:37.469 --> 1:14:39.405
Hey, all right.

1:14:39.471 --> 1:14:41.273
Some butt kicking,
count me in, huh?

1:14:41.340 --> 1:14:44.510
Hey, guys, count me in, too.

1:14:44.576 --> 1:14:46.545
Let's go, baby.

1:14:46.612 --> 1:14:49.882
Yeah, oh... Sonny West.

1:14:49.948 --> 1:14:52.551
Oh, I can't believe it,
it's Sonny West.

1:14:52.618 --> 1:14:53.818
Hey, grandma.

1:14:55.387 --> 1:14:58.324
<i>So off we all went
in a caravan</i>

1:14:58.390 --> 1:15:01.660
<i>trying to get to the
CIA base and back</i>

1:15:01.727 --> 1:15:04.496
<i>before that night's final round.</i>

1:15:04.563 --> 1:15:07.466
<i>Of course,
we didn't get far before...</i>

1:15:15.441 --> 1:15:19.078
<i>The thing was,
JB didn't have a license.</i>

1:15:19.144 --> 1:15:23.182
<i>Or any record of even existing,
for that matter.</i>

1:15:23.248 --> 1:15:25.684
<i>If this cop were to radio
back to headquarters</i>

1:15:25.751 --> 1:15:30.389
<i>Messina knew the cat would
be outta the bag for sure.</i>

1:15:32.057 --> 1:15:34.126
Low roll the windows, please.

1:15:34.193 --> 1:15:35.461
What's the problem, officer?

1:15:35.527 --> 1:15:39.264
What do we have here,
an early Halloween party?

1:15:39.331 --> 1:15:42.267
Officer, I'm a federal agent.

1:15:42.334 --> 1:15:44.103
We need to be on our way.

1:15:46.672 --> 1:15:48.140
All right.

1:15:50.042 --> 1:15:51.243
Drive safe.

1:15:53.178 --> 1:15:54.880
And don't be cruel.

1:15:55.681 --> 1:15:57.483
- Thank you, sir.
- Oh, yeah.

1:15:57.549 --> 1:15:59.151
Thank you very much.

1:15:59.218 --> 1:16:03.155
<i>Agent Messina
was as cool as they come.</i>

1:16:30.582 --> 1:16:32.184
He's left the contest?

1:16:32.751 --> 1:16:34.453
Are you sure?

1:16:36.188 --> 1:16:37.589
Who the hell are you?

1:16:40.459 --> 1:16:43.095
Come on, baby,
we're outta this joint.

1:16:43.162 --> 1:16:44.630
Not so fast, King.

1:16:45.531 --> 1:16:46.565
Hi, Bobby.

1:16:46.632 --> 1:16:47.901
King, you're mine now,

1:16:47.966 --> 1:16:50.202
and you are not getting out
of this one easily.

1:16:57.075 --> 1:16:58.343
Oh shit.

1:16:59.144 --> 1:17:00.479
Come on.

1:17:15.761 --> 1:17:19.031
JB, we gotta get down
to the finals, boy,

1:17:19.097 --> 1:17:22.334
'cause if we're a no show,
they're gonna disqualify us.

1:17:22.401 --> 1:17:24.436
I got some unfinished business
to take care of.

1:17:24.503 --> 1:17:26.538
I will catch up
with you later, Big M.

1:17:26.605 --> 1:17:28.507
All right.

1:17:28.574 --> 1:17:30.509
but don't you be late,
'cause, uh...

1:17:30.576 --> 1:17:33.178
if I'm gonna get beat out
by anybody,

1:17:33.245 --> 1:17:35.314
it's gonna be The King.

1:17:35.380 --> 1:17:37.616
It's gonna be an honor.

1:17:37.683 --> 1:17:39.785
Big M, I really appreciate
everything you've done,

1:17:39.853 --> 1:17:41.253
you and the boys.

1:17:43.255 --> 1:17:45.557
Shucks, we ain't
done nothing but...

1:17:47.894 --> 1:17:49.995
Thank you. Thank you very much.

1:18:00.806 --> 1:18:02.274
So what now?

1:18:06.411 --> 1:18:08.447
I really have to go now.

1:18:29.836 --> 1:18:31.770
Let's go, Jackie.

1:18:31.838 --> 1:18:34.273
The buffet is still open.

1:18:34.339 --> 1:18:36.174
I'll take you there.

1:18:41.881 --> 1:18:45.183
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
our first performer

1:18:45.250 --> 1:18:48.387

1:22:25.771 --> 1:22:28.607
I really wanna thank you
for everything you've done.

1:22:28.673 --> 1:22:30.575
You've really been
a good friend.

1:22:30.642 --> 1:22:33.278
Well, you deserved
a second chance, JB.

1:22:34.080 --> 1:22:35.280
Thank you.

1:23:07.646 --> 1:23:08.848
Thank you,
thank you so very much.

1:23:08.915 --> 1:23:10.850
Ladies and gentlemen,
I am sorry to announce

1:23:10.917 --> 1:23:13.853
that Mr. John Burrows
is not able to do his final set.

1:23:13.920 --> 1:23:15.154
So, um, stay calm,

1:23:15.221 --> 1:23:16.488
stay calm for just a minute.

1:23:16.555 --> 1:23:17.789
Now listen, unfortunately,

1:23:17.857 --> 1:23:20.860
due to strict contest rules,
he is in default,

1:23:20.927 --> 1:23:22.862
and therefore is disqualified
from the competition.

1:23:22.929 --> 1:23:24.663
But what we're gonna,
just stay, stay, hold on,

1:23:24.729 --> 1:23:26.565
what we're gonna do
is we're just, hold on!

1:23:26.631 --> 1:23:28.466
Could you get off?
Hey, hey, get!

1:23:34.806 --> 1:23:37.043
I'm not ever gonna
see you again, am I?

1:23:38.144 --> 1:23:39.678
Never?

1:23:39.744 --> 1:23:42.014
Don't ever say never, honey.

1:23:58.530 --> 1:23:59.966
Okay, now listen to me.

1:24:00.032 --> 1:24:03.970
I've gotta go somewhere right
now where nobody can follow,

1:24:04.036 --> 1:24:06.605
not even you, baby doll.

1:24:06.671 --> 1:24:07.806
But Agent Messina
over there

1:24:07.874 --> 1:24:11.043
and the boys
will take care of you, okay?

1:24:16.282 --> 1:24:17.950
<i>I love you, honey.</i>

1:24:21.988 --> 1:24:25.157
Remember,
I'll be out there forever.

1:24:27.059 --> 1:24:28.928
I'll always love you.

1:24:50.582 --> 1:24:53.718
He can't make it. Help him.

1:24:54.220 --> 1:24:55.420
Help him.

1:25:18.144 --> 1:25:19.811
Thank you, thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.

1:25:19.879 --> 1:25:20.880
Now that was exciting

1:25:20.947 --> 1:25:22.915
and that's what
Las Vegas is all about.

1:25:22.982 --> 1:25:26.118
