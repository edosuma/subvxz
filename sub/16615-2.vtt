00:01.938 --> 00:03.819
What you saw was a small piece

00:03.844 --> 00:05.717
of the end of your story. You will die.

00:05.742 --> 00:07.543
Emma: This could be the
end of the Evil Queen.

00:07.577 --> 00:08.911
Regina: I want to start a new story.

00:08.945 --> 00:10.112
And <i>this</i> story

00:10.146 --> 00:11.780
will have a better ending than my last.

00:11.815 --> 00:13.882
You ripped out the part of yourself

00:13.917 --> 00:15.451
that was most like me!

00:15.485 --> 00:16.819
Let's have a drink, sis.

00:16.853 --> 00:18.921
Time for some sisterly bonding.

00:20.690 --> 00:24.259
I agreed to a drink, not
a private graveyard tour.

00:24.294 --> 00:25.561
Where are we going?

00:25.595 --> 00:27.696
You'll see.

00:28.865 --> 00:32.401
No. No way. I can't let you in there.

00:33.042 --> 00:36.739
If Regina didn't want me helping
myself to a few ingredients,

00:36.773 --> 00:39.274
she wouldn't have sealed
the vault with blood magic.

00:46.049 --> 00:48.117
And how do you know I won't tell her

00:48.151 --> 00:49.485
about this little field trip?

00:49.519 --> 00:52.788
[Chuckles] Because
you already would have.

00:52.822 --> 00:54.089
Why do you need all that magic?

00:54.124 --> 00:56.859
Because I already used
everything The Dragon

00:56.893 --> 01:00.133
had in his shop to get to
this pitiful little town.

01:00.158 --> 01:02.025
And what became of him?

01:03.900 --> 01:06.769
Let's just say he
should have known better

01:07.076 --> 01:08.251
than to get in my way.

You're worried I'm going to
hurt my better half, aren't you?

01:16.546 --> 01:18.981
It remains to be seen
which half is better.

01:20.039 --> 01:20.987
Relax.

01:21.012 --> 01:25.116
I'm just going to use this
to teach Regina a lesson...

01:25.188 --> 01:27.956
that she can never
escape who she really is.

01:27.991 --> 01:29.725
And what do I get out of it?

01:29.759 --> 01:32.795
A sister who... appreciates

01:32.820 --> 01:35.955
all of your delightfully
malevolent qualities.

02:03.626 --> 02:05.727
Everyone listened to me before...

02:06.183 --> 02:09.085
because I was the Evil Queen.

02:09.169 --> 02:10.164
Now I'm going to show them

that I'm just as strong without her.

02:50.310 --> 02:53.108
to officially welcome
you to Storybrooke.

02:53.142 --> 02:56.812
You fled to the Land of Untold Stories

02:56.846 --> 03:00.883

whatever was in this book

03:00.917 --> 03:03.151
is going to play out.

03:03.186 --> 03:07.589
But now that you're here, I'm
sure you're scared it will.

03:07.624 --> 03:10.859
But what you don't realize is...

03:13.429 --> 03:15.597
I'm just like you.

03:16.412 --> 03:19.968
I'm also getting a fresh start,

03:20.003 --> 03:22.337
and I don't know what
the future holds either.

03:22.372 --> 03:26.008
But I do know one thing.

03:26.042 --> 03:28.143
We don't have to be afraid of anything,

03:28.759 --> 03:31.079

I put him there myself.

06:09.347 --> 06:11.414
Indeed, you did.

06:11.449 --> 06:13.519
Right after you burnt down his home,

06:13.544 --> 06:17.180
squandered his family fortune,
and murdered his fiancée.

06:19.444 --> 06:21.923
But he escaped that dungeon.

a decade of your life

the less it will haunt you.

You think I should tell my family?

10:04.033 --> 10:05.697
Well...

10:05.722 --> 10:07.823
I mean, the question
is, why haven't you?

10:08.249 --> 10:10.050
Because I know exactly
what they would do.

10:10.075 --> 10:11.742
They would tell me to
stop doing what I'm doing

10:11.767 --> 10:12.967
until they could save the day.

10:12.998 --> 10:14.786
And what would be so wrong
about them trying to protect you?

10:14.803 --> 10:16.671
Because I'm the Savior.

have to ask yourself.

some identity crisis.

11:09.323 --> 11:11.758
Well, I didn't know
he was in Storybrooke.

11:11.952 --> 11:13.129
And do you really want

11:13.154 --> 11:14.663
to hear about every
time I tried to kill you?

11:14.688 --> 11:15.922
Yes.

11:15.956 --> 11:17.824
I'm sorry. I'm...

11:17.858 --> 11:18.734
[Breathes deeply]

11:18.759 --> 11:21.360
You know I'm trying
to put that behind me.

11:21.385 --> 11:23.580
Clearly, the Count didn't get the memo.

11:23.628 --> 11:24.528
Maybe that's the problem.

11:24.562 --> 11:26.063
You hired him. You fire him.

11:26.097 --> 11:28.499
Well, that's exactly
what I'm going to do.

11:28.533 --> 11:30.833
The invitation says to meet
him at the dirigible in an hour.

11:30.858 --> 11:32.626
- Well, we're coming with you.
- No.

11:33.104 --> 11:36.940
This is my mess. I'll fix it.

11:36.975 --> 11:38.628
And, really, it should go more smoothly

11:38.653 --> 11:40.587
if he's not trying to
use you as a pin cushion.

11:40.637 --> 11:43.205
You really think we need
to worry about this guy?

11:43.239 --> 11:44.339
It took him two curses

11:44.374 --> 11:47.109
and a pit stop in the Land
of Untold Stories to find us.

11:47.143 --> 11:49.177
Well, that's not exactly true.

11:51.014 --> 11:52.648
[Horse neighs]

11:58.655 --> 12:02.324
[Horse neighs]

12:11.099 --> 12:12.750
We're too late.

12:12.767 --> 12:14.797
Remind me why we spared
the Evil Queen's life again.

12:14.822 --> 12:15.955
We thought it would change her.

12:15.980 --> 12:17.480
It changed her, all right.

12:17.515 --> 12:18.760
Instead of ransacking villages,

12:18.785 --> 12:21.282
she's now razing them to the ground.

12:21.307 --> 12:22.185
[Coughing]

12:22.219 --> 12:24.420
Snow, over here.

12:25.142 --> 12:26.509
[Coughs]

12:27.807 --> 12:29.775
All right. You're all right.

12:30.955 --> 12:32.086
Charming: We're here to help.

12:32.111 --> 12:34.246
It's all right. You're safe.

12:34.465 --> 12:36.266
- What's your name, friend?
- Edmond.

12:36.985 --> 12:38.968
I was the vintner here.

12:39.360 --> 12:42.338
When the Queen's knights
attacked, everyone fled.

12:42.373 --> 12:43.625
I stayed to put out the fires.

12:43.650 --> 12:44.783
It's okay, Edmond.

12:44.808 --> 12:46.109
Charlotte!

12:46.143 --> 12:47.176
Over here.

12:49.046 --> 12:50.513
Charlotte's my handmaiden.

12:50.548 --> 12:52.112
Thanks to this endless war,

12:52.137 --> 12:54.005
she's become quite the skilled nurse.

12:56.066 --> 12:57.925
[Sighs] Let's see.

13:00.400 --> 13:01.711
The burns aren't too bad.

13:01.736 --> 13:04.533
A little salve will have
you back to new soon enough.

13:06.674 --> 13:07.524
Is something wrong?

13:07.549 --> 13:08.703
No.

13:10.401 --> 13:11.838
Your eyes.

13:11.863 --> 13:13.497
What of them?

13:13.571 --> 13:15.641
Thank you for your aid.

13:15.727 --> 13:18.741
We must find the Queen and make her pay.

13:18.776 --> 13:21.376
Well, that would make
us no better than her.

13:21.401 --> 13:23.904
The best way to get our
revenge is to show the Queen

13:23.929 --> 13:27.577
that no matter what she does,
we can always find happiness.

13:27.602 --> 13:29.637
She destroyed my village, my vines,

13:29.662 --> 13:31.256
- everything I have.
- Right.

13:31.623 --> 13:34.124
Well, perhaps you won't
find happiness here.

13:34.355 --> 13:36.823
But maybe you will at our castle.

13:36.857 --> 13:38.998
We could use a wine steward.

13:39.022 --> 13:40.522
What do you say, Edmond?

13:40.557 --> 13:41.657
[Chuckles]

13:41.924 --> 13:43.892
There's nothing I'd like more.

13:57.041 --> 13:59.475
I'm afraid you're not on the guest list.

13:59.510 --> 14:01.778
I'm calling off our deal, Count.

14:03.347 --> 14:04.747
What happened?

14:04.782 --> 14:06.084
Did they finally convince you

14:06.109 --> 14:08.686
that finding your happiness
is the best revenge?

14:08.711 --> 14:10.311
Actually, yes.

14:10.588 --> 14:14.223
It took some time, but...

14:14.258 --> 14:16.001
they're right.

14:16.071 --> 14:18.239
But that doesn't change anything.

14:18.609 --> 14:20.428
Let me help you.

14:22.054 --> 14:23.351
You don't need revenge

14:23.376 --> 14:25.778
to get over what happened
to the person you loved.

14:26.859 --> 14:30.985
If I can learn that, anyone can.

14:31.019 --> 14:34.221
You may have sent me down this path,

14:34.256 --> 14:37.558
but not even you can take me off it now.

14:38.293 --> 14:39.660
[Gasps]

14:49.793 --> 14:50.493
On it.

14:50.972 --> 14:52.326
What happened?
[Engine starts]

14:52.351 --> 14:54.653
Errol Flynn is not backing down.

15:01.446 --> 15:02.713
Where are you taking us?

15:02.748 --> 15:04.682
I told Regina I'd take
you somewhere safe.

15:05.046 --> 15:06.406
Emma, no, we are not leaving town.

15:06.431 --> 15:08.799
We're not running from our wine steward.

15:12.211 --> 15:15.247
[Tires screech]

15:15.281 --> 15:16.748
Oh!

15:16.993 --> 15:18.694
What the hell was that?

15:19.638 --> 15:22.283
Looks like the Count doesn't
want you running either.

15:26.713 --> 15:28.985
What? T-This is where
you want me to stay?

15:29.010 --> 15:30.344
The <i>Jolly Roger?</i>

15:30.369 --> 15:32.938
Yeah, I'm sorry. I-I can't stay here.

15:32.963 --> 15:34.664
If Rumple finds you harboring me...

15:34.689 --> 15:36.478
His wrath will be an added bonus.

15:36.704 --> 15:37.518
I don't understand.

15:37.543 --> 15:39.677
Why would you risk your life for me?

15:40.027 --> 15:41.761
[Breathes deeply]

15:42.313 --> 15:45.600
Long ago, I...

15:45.634 --> 15:47.832
I tried to kill you in
the Queen's castle once.

15:47.857 --> 15:49.327
I failed.

15:50.365 --> 15:53.351
But along the way, I
did something I can...

15:54.590 --> 15:55.924
live with no longer.

15:56.271 --> 15:57.805
I laid a hand on you.

16:00.041 --> 16:02.774
And there's the matter of my
shooting you at the town line.

16:02.799 --> 16:05.688
Yeah, well, you've
changed since all that.

16:05.817 --> 16:07.718
Maybe.

16:08.085 --> 16:09.150
I have a long road to travel

16:09.166 --> 16:11.078
before I can be someone
I can be proud of.

16:11.103 --> 16:14.339
Despite the forgiveness of others,

16:15.429 --> 16:17.771
I must forgive myself,
and I'm not there yet.

16:17.920 --> 16:19.498
Well, then I accept.

16:19.607 --> 16:20.424
You're not the only one

16:20.449 --> 16:22.584
trying to make up for past mistakes.

16:22.655 --> 16:25.637
I spent way too long trying
to make things work with Rumple

16:25.662 --> 16:28.531
just because I wanted them to.

16:29.155 --> 16:32.033
Now I've got to do
what's best for my son.

16:34.445 --> 16:37.714
I don't think the Count crashed the car.

16:39.250 --> 16:40.559
Protection spell?

16:40.584 --> 16:41.277
Just like the one you used

16:41.302 --> 16:43.269
to keep everyone here during the curse.

16:44.104 --> 16:45.732
[Sighs] Not <i>like</i> it.

16:46.624 --> 16:48.390
This is the same spell.

16:48.422 --> 16:49.647
Well, the only way to do that

16:49.672 --> 16:51.673
is with the ingredients from my vault,

16:51.993 --> 16:54.191
which I sealed with blood magic.

16:54.216 --> 16:55.049
- I...
- [Whoosh]

16:55.199 --> 16:56.845
Zelena: Regina. I got your message.

16:56.870 --> 16:58.270
Is everyone okay?

16:58.369 --> 16:59.304
You know, I'll never understand

16:59.329 --> 17:01.006
why you parade around
in these deathtraps

17:01.031 --> 17:03.065
rather than just magicking
yourself around town.

17:03.100 --> 17:03.899
What happened?

17:03.924 --> 17:07.546
Well, someone put a protection
spell on the town line.

17:08.542 --> 17:09.672
Really?

17:09.705 --> 17:12.208
Well, who would do that?

17:12.242 --> 17:14.542
I was gonna ask you the same question.

17:14.578 --> 17:16.752
You're accusing me of causing this?

17:16.776 --> 17:18.611
Oh, come on. Zelena, other than me,

17:18.645 --> 17:21.113
you're the only one who can
open the lock to my vault.

17:21.146 --> 17:22.815
- That's not true!
- Really?

17:24.684 --> 17:28.654
Well, if it wasn't me,
and it wasn't you...

17:28.688 --> 17:30.189
then who?

17:30.223 --> 17:31.786
I have no idea, sis.

17:32.194 --> 17:34.562
But I'm getting tired
of this inquisition.

17:37.964 --> 17:39.384
I'm starting to think the Count

17:39.409 --> 17:42.228
isn't the only one we
have to be worried about.

17:54.897 --> 17:56.064
[Grunts]

17:56.098 --> 17:57.231
[Laughs]

17:57.266 --> 17:59.233
Impressive, Your Majesty.

17:59.954 --> 18:01.384
Well, what can I say?

18:01.409 --> 18:02.543
You inspired me.

18:06.241 --> 18:10.678
Perhaps you can give me a lesson.

18:10.713 --> 18:12.046
Or two.

18:13.816 --> 18:15.677
As much as I'd enjoy
that, I can't be late

18:15.702 --> 18:19.772
for my first meal with
Snow White and her prince.

18:19.989 --> 18:22.013
So they believed you.

18:22.038 --> 18:23.274
[Laughs]

18:23.299 --> 18:25.329
I knew their insufferable kindness

18:25.354 --> 18:26.798
would be their downfall.

18:30.299 --> 18:34.535
Venom of the Agrabahn viper.

18:34.570 --> 18:39.841
A bitter draft... slow and painful.

18:41.146 --> 18:44.215
Is there a problem, Count?

18:44.250 --> 18:46.818
What did they do to deserve this?

18:46.852 --> 18:50.455
They've shown me nothing but kindness.

18:50.489 --> 18:54.058
Don't tell me you're
starting to grow a conscience.

18:54.093 --> 18:56.160
Call it professional curiosity.

18:56.195 --> 18:59.421
[Sighs] Well, what
they did doesn't matter.

18:59.666 --> 19:03.135
Only one thing should be
on your mind right now...

19:03.169 --> 19:08.206
how badly you want your revenge.

19:10.243 --> 19:11.977
[Chuckles]

19:13.040 --> 19:15.074
I thought so.

19:29.328 --> 19:31.182
Rumplestiltskin: Well,
this is very disappointing.

19:31.198 --> 19:33.800
I mean, I didn't spend
years training you

19:33.834 --> 19:35.602
so you could spend your days fencing

19:35.636 --> 19:37.502
and get someone else
to do your dirty work.

19:37.527 --> 19:40.996
Oh, you know exactly why I'm doing this.

19:41.522 --> 19:46.155
You put a spell on Snow and
Charming so I can't hurt them.

19:46.180 --> 19:47.796
Yeah.

19:47.821 --> 19:49.388
And then I gave you the Dark Curse

19:49.413 --> 19:51.672
so you could take them
somewhere where you can.

19:51.697 --> 19:52.797
I don't care.

19:54.461 --> 19:56.356
I'm going to get what I want,

19:56.390 --> 19:58.124
and I'll get it without you.

19:58.158 --> 19:59.535
Oh.

19:59.778 --> 20:02.411
Are you sure about that?

20:03.574 --> 20:09.119
If you think you can stop
the Count, think again.

20:09.154 --> 20:10.373
Is that a threat?

20:10.397 --> 20:12.498
- Mnh. It's a fact.
- [Inhales deeply]

20:12.791 --> 20:17.394
That protection spell you
put on the Charmings...

20:17.429 --> 20:20.329
I put the same enchantment on the Count

20:20.353 --> 20:23.455
to protect him from you.

20:23.768 --> 20:25.131
[Both chuckle]

20:25.156 --> 20:26.256
[Gasps]

20:26.358 --> 20:29.227
Looks like the student has
finally outgrown the teacher.

20:29.261 --> 20:30.995
- [Chuckles]
- Mm, mm, mm.

20:31.030 --> 20:33.231
- Mwah.
- Mm, mm, mm.

20:33.265 --> 20:35.133
We'll see about that, dearie.

20:36.902 --> 20:38.369
[Chuckles]

20:40.160 --> 20:41.994
[Door bells jingle]

20:44.276 --> 20:46.044
[Door bells jingle]

21:04.606 --> 21:06.574
When I heard what Regina did,

21:06.608 --> 21:10.294
I thought, "No, this
is too good to be true."

21:10.319 --> 21:13.445
Don't lie. You're happy I'm back.

21:13.470 --> 21:15.270
[Chuckles]

21:15.651 --> 21:18.307
"Happy" isn't the word I'd use.

21:20.408 --> 21:21.882
Now, where is it?

21:21.907 --> 21:25.343
[Clicks tongue, sighs]

21:26.023 --> 21:26.922
[Whoosh]

21:29.574 --> 21:31.845
Did you really think
you could steal from me?

21:31.870 --> 21:34.505
Oh. It's just a piece of tin.

21:34.564 --> 21:36.298
And yet, so much more.

21:37.253 --> 21:39.835
You want a deal?

21:39.870 --> 21:44.373
If you want this bauble,
my terms are simple.

21:44.408 --> 21:47.309
Whatever you have planned for this town,

21:47.344 --> 21:51.514
leave Belle and my unborn son out of it.

21:51.548 --> 21:53.385
[Sighs]

21:53.466 --> 21:54.943
Do you want the coin or not?

21:55.485 --> 21:56.940
Fine.

21:56.965 --> 21:58.199
I won't hurt them.

22:01.837 --> 22:03.610
But...

22:03.635 --> 22:08.272
are you sure that's
all you want in return?

22:09.211 --> 22:10.382
Hmm?

22:10.564 --> 22:12.298
What else did you have in mind?

22:12.816 --> 22:14.480
Oh, I don't know.

22:16.785 --> 22:19.821
The tales in the Land of Untold Stories

22:20.262 --> 22:23.061
aren't the only ones
that never played out.

22:23.096 --> 22:25.197
[Chuckles]

22:25.483 --> 22:27.811
And what makes you
think I have any interest

22:27.836 --> 22:29.703
in seeing how this one goes?

22:30.171 --> 22:35.085
Eventually, you'll get tired
of waiting for that bookworm

22:35.110 --> 22:37.044
to accept you for who you are.

22:37.633 --> 22:40.068
And when you do...

22:41.865 --> 22:44.330
mm...

22:44.355 --> 22:47.023
that's when the real fun can begin.

22:59.882 --> 23:02.718
[Indistinct conversation in distance]

23:26.342 --> 23:28.097
- Edmond, wait.
- Is something wrong?

23:28.122 --> 23:29.011
No, we just need

23:29.036 --> 23:30.303
one more glass.

23:30.655 --> 23:32.589
Sorry I'm late.

23:34.436 --> 23:36.304
Tonight, we say farewell to Charlotte.

23:36.338 --> 23:38.239
I'm afraid she's leaving us tomorrow.

23:38.274 --> 23:39.707
Charlotte: My mother's fallen ill,

23:39.742 --> 23:43.050
so I'm going home to help
my family care for her.

23:43.075 --> 23:45.410
Well, this family will
miss you when you're gone.

23:46.378 --> 23:47.711
Pour the wine, Edmond.

23:47.736 --> 23:50.838
Tonight, we toast to old friends.

23:59.154 --> 24:00.221
Thank you.

24:04.202 --> 24:06.022
Edmond, what is it?

24:06.047 --> 24:07.448
It's your eyes again.

24:08.092 --> 24:10.262
That's... very kind of you.

24:10.287 --> 24:11.321
[Sighs]

24:13.880 --> 24:17.015
Well, thank you, Charlotte.

24:17.050 --> 24:17.829
[Clears throat]

24:17.854 --> 24:18.987
To Charlotte.

24:20.603 --> 24:23.605
May she only find happy days ahead.

24:32.088 --> 24:33.522
Wait!

24:33.556 --> 24:34.556
What is it?

24:34.591 --> 24:36.584
Is everything all right?

24:36.609 --> 24:37.942
Yes. It's...

24:38.424 --> 24:39.558
It's just, an occasion like this

24:39.583 --> 24:40.818
calls for a bottle to match,

24:40.843 --> 24:43.845
and, uh, I have just the
one in the cellar, so...

24:43.870 --> 24:46.038
forgive me, miss.

24:51.637 --> 24:53.640
I know you think this
was your fault, Mom.

24:53.665 --> 24:55.632
That's not it, Henry.

24:55.734 --> 24:56.922
I stood up in Granny's

24:56.947 --> 24:59.359
and told everyone from the
Land of Untold Stories

24:59.384 --> 25:00.851
not to be afraid.

25:01.398 --> 25:03.265
They've only been here one day.

25:03.394 --> 25:05.116
I can't let the first
story play out like this,

25:05.141 --> 25:06.742
not when I'm the one who started it all.

25:06.864 --> 25:08.031
[Gasps]

25:08.420 --> 25:09.299
Mom.

25:09.903 --> 25:11.405
[Sighs]

25:13.571 --> 25:18.341
He poisoned her with
the poison I gave him.

25:22.746 --> 25:23.663
Mom, are you okay?

25:23.688 --> 25:25.044
What the hell was that?

25:25.069 --> 25:27.216
What the hell is going on?!

25:27.250 --> 25:28.407
Evil Queen: The handmaiden's story

25:28.432 --> 25:30.373
finally caught up with her.

25:32.420 --> 25:36.225
Just like yours is catching up with you.

25:36.443 --> 25:38.327
Miss me?

25:38.617 --> 25:40.229
Hi, sweetie.

25:40.481 --> 25:42.122
Mommy's back.

25:42.147 --> 25:43.548
No.

25:45.094 --> 25:46.461
I killed you.

25:46.488 --> 25:48.856
Did you really think
it would be that easy?

25:48.890 --> 25:51.027
- Mom.
- Get behind me, honey.

25:51.159 --> 25:54.195
After everything I did for you,

25:54.478 --> 25:58.733
after everything we
accomplished together,

25:58.767 --> 26:02.903
you threw me away like I never existed.

26:02.938 --> 26:07.174
No, I threw you away
<i>because</i> you existed.

26:09.041 --> 26:11.178
What the hell?

26:11.525 --> 26:15.816
I laced the girl's cloak
with a magic dampening spell.

26:15.851 --> 26:17.474
I should have known.

26:17.499 --> 26:20.300
You've been controlling
the Count this whole time.

26:21.642 --> 26:23.991
Well, of course I have.

26:25.360 --> 26:28.108
I don't leave things to chance.

26:29.016 --> 26:31.151
That's why he didn't want my help.

26:31.495 --> 26:34.721
That's why he said I couldn't stop him.

26:35.053 --> 26:36.590
You ordered the Count

26:36.624 --> 26:39.666
to kill Snow and Charming
all those years ago,

26:39.691 --> 26:41.425
so now...

26:42.253 --> 26:45.132
that's exactly what he's going to do.

26:45.166 --> 26:46.967
[Chuckles]

26:47.756 --> 26:49.703
You should be thanking me.

27:03.450 --> 27:04.583
Edmond.

27:05.817 --> 27:06.569
Edmond, come on.

27:06.594 --> 27:08.453
This is all just a big misunderstanding.

27:10.708 --> 27:12.492
Oh, you have no idea.

27:21.544 --> 27:24.345
Edmond, we can explain everything.

27:24.380 --> 27:26.481
The Queen's our friend. She's changed.

27:26.515 --> 27:28.149
She doesn't want you to do this.

27:28.184 --> 27:30.552
That's where you're wrong. She does.

27:37.875 --> 27:38.914
Then why are you doing this?

27:38.939 --> 27:40.072
[Grunts]

27:40.097 --> 27:41.570
Because she has my heart!

27:50.439 --> 27:51.559
Who, Edmond?

27:51.584 --> 27:52.751
Who has your heart?

27:53.262 --> 27:54.558
The Evil Queen.

27:54.583 --> 27:56.951
[Grunts]

27:59.361 --> 28:01.095
She can't be.

28:01.129 --> 28:03.898
Yeah, well, it looks like she is.

28:07.993 --> 28:09.162
But it doesn't matter.

28:09.187 --> 28:10.788
We'll find a way to stop her.

28:14.599 --> 28:16.183
We always do.

28:18.032 --> 28:19.233
I hope so...

28:26.825 --> 28:30.394
because this isn't the
ending I wished for any of us.

28:42.260 --> 28:44.829
Having second thoughts?

28:45.401 --> 28:47.469
[Giggles]

28:47.873 --> 28:49.474
No need for that, dearie.

28:51.043 --> 28:53.416
Tell me... why didn't you poison

28:53.441 --> 28:55.430
Snow White and Prince Charming?

28:55.455 --> 28:58.157
I was prepared to poison them, but...

28:58.579 --> 29:00.633
I saw Charlotte, and
she reminded me of...

29:00.658 --> 29:01.892
Your fiancée?

29:02.094 --> 29:05.164
Yeah, yeah, I-I-I can see that.

29:05.290 --> 29:08.025
I mean, before she
became a rotting corpse.

29:08.059 --> 29:09.927
Your love and... and the handmaiden

29:09.961 --> 29:12.429
share the same je ne
sais quoi, n'est-ce pas?

29:13.975 --> 29:16.030
She didn't deserve to die.

29:16.070 --> 29:17.846
And if I had killed her
just to get my revenge,

29:17.933 --> 29:19.691
- I'd be no better than my enemies.
- Yes, yes.

29:19.716 --> 29:21.884
But... but Snow White
and Prince Charmy-warmy,

29:21.909 --> 29:23.677
you gonna try again?

29:24.936 --> 29:26.179
No.

29:26.573 --> 29:28.607
They don't deserve to die either.

29:31.019 --> 29:32.519
Hm. [Snaps fingers]

29:32.553 --> 29:33.458
[Whoosh, thud]

29:33.483 --> 29:34.817
What was that?

29:34.870 --> 29:36.805
My insurance policy.

29:36.909 --> 29:39.911
Let's just say in order
for my plan to work,

29:40.094 --> 29:43.066
I need Prince Charming and Snow White

29:43.091 --> 29:47.324
very much alive and procreating.

29:47.576 --> 29:50.221
Sorry for bluntness,
but I need what I need.

29:50.246 --> 29:53.482
So that means I must make sure

29:53.659 --> 29:57.829
that you're never tempted
to kill them ever again.

29:58.764 --> 30:00.265
- Boop.
- [Whoosh]

30:07.746 --> 30:08.823
Charlotte?

30:08.848 --> 30:09.715
[Giggles]

30:10.015 --> 30:11.349
Why?

30:11.383 --> 30:14.419
If you didn't want me to kill them,
kill <i>me,</i> not <i>her!</i>

30:14.453 --> 30:15.980
Would that I could, dearie.

30:16.005 --> 30:17.005
[Breathing heavily]

30:17.754 --> 30:18.778
Where's the antidote?

30:18.803 --> 30:21.250
[Chuckling] Antidote? There isn't any.

30:21.298 --> 30:23.066
There's no cure for this poison.

30:23.100 --> 30:24.500
[Gasps]

30:24.535 --> 30:27.603
No, no, no.

30:27.848 --> 30:30.149
But it can be stopped.

30:31.568 --> 30:32.288
A key?

30:32.313 --> 30:34.314
This isn't any old key.

30:34.678 --> 30:37.778
This is the key to the
land where all stories

30:37.803 --> 30:42.540
come to a screeching halt,
including Charlotte's story.

30:42.753 --> 30:44.002
You know the one...

30:44.027 --> 30:46.020
where the poison reaches her heart.

30:46.045 --> 30:47.312
[Chokes]

30:51.329 --> 30:52.729
I go through there, she lives?

30:52.764 --> 30:53.730
Indeed!

30:53.765 --> 30:55.299
As long as you remain there.

30:55.753 --> 30:57.134
If you should ever leave,

30:57.168 --> 31:01.171
her story and the
poison shall r-r-resume.

31:01.432 --> 31:04.174
And I hate to spoil the ending,

31:04.209 --> 31:07.211
but it's really quite tragic.

31:11.115 --> 31:13.383
- Then it's settled.
- [Giggles]

31:24.487 --> 31:26.237
I'm sorry.

31:26.262 --> 31:28.663
All I wanted was a fresh start.

31:30.630 --> 31:32.497
You can still get one.

31:35.548 --> 31:37.816
Listen, I know the Evil
Queen has your heart,

31:38.107 --> 31:39.675
but you <i>can</i> fight this.

31:42.021 --> 31:43.874
Okay. That's a start.

31:43.899 --> 31:45.800
I've tried to fight!

31:45.936 --> 31:47.069
I can't!

31:57.603 --> 31:59.338
Your story doesn't
have to end like this.

31:59.372 --> 32:01.778
My story ended the
moment Hyde plucked us

32:01.803 --> 32:03.704
from the Land of Untold Stories!

32:04.190 --> 32:06.925
Oh! Ow!

32:07.371 --> 32:08.680
You mean Charlotte?

32:08.715 --> 32:09.548
I'm sorry.

32:09.965 --> 32:11.750
I was too late.

32:11.784 --> 32:13.552
So the poison finally took her.

32:16.652 --> 32:18.620
I may not have been
able to save <i>her,</i>

32:18.645 --> 32:21.680
but I am going to save <i>you.</i>

32:30.770 --> 32:33.004
Henry, call Emma!

32:33.029 --> 32:35.196
I could use some of her
magic right about now!

32:36.891 --> 32:39.893
I can't! It's the Queen!

32:39.928 --> 32:41.061
She did something.

32:46.403 --> 32:47.770
[Laughs]

32:47.804 --> 32:49.305
[Panting]

32:51.373 --> 32:52.841
Stop!

32:52.866 --> 32:53.899
Please.

32:56.369 --> 32:57.970
This is the only way.

33:02.419 --> 33:04.153
[Screams]

33:14.917 --> 33:15.850
No!

33:18.983 --> 33:21.022
Mom, Mom. Are... are you okay?

33:21.056 --> 33:22.659
[Voice breaking] I'm so sorry.

33:22.684 --> 33:23.818
- Mom.
- Henry.

33:24.059 --> 33:25.760
Mom.

33:25.794 --> 33:27.528
You did what you had to.

33:29.431 --> 33:31.436
[Sobbing]

33:31.461 --> 33:32.495
Edmond.

33:33.507 --> 33:35.642
No.

33:37.028 --> 33:38.828
I had no choice.

33:38.989 --> 33:41.991
No, that's not true.

33:46.173 --> 33:47.340
She <i>is</i> back.

33:47.375 --> 33:50.844
I couldn't just stand by and
watch the Count kill my friends.

33:50.878 --> 33:53.713
Oh, I thought heroes
always found a third way...

33:54.315 --> 33:59.721
unless, of course, this means
you're <i>not</i> a hero.

33:59.746 --> 34:02.141
- [Laughs]
- [Grunts]

34:02.166 --> 34:03.633
I will rip your heart out!

34:03.821 --> 34:06.556
Yes! That's the Regina I remember.

34:07.152 --> 34:11.222
We do like it rough, don't we?

34:13.199 --> 34:16.255
You didn't want the Count
to kill Snow and David.

34:16.280 --> 34:18.092
You wanted <i>me</i> to kill <i>him.</i>

34:18.118 --> 34:20.362
Well, it was the only way to show you

34:20.400 --> 34:22.803
that no matter what you do...

34:22.837 --> 34:26.306
the darkness will always be inside.

34:26.793 --> 34:31.411
And that tiny bit of darkness

34:31.446 --> 34:33.547
I awakened today

34:33.572 --> 34:35.572
is only going to grow.

34:35.616 --> 34:37.484
Don't listen to her, Regina.

34:37.518 --> 34:40.371
Snow... White.

34:40.396 --> 34:42.163
- Snow.
- No, I'm not afraid of her.

34:42.369 --> 34:44.246
We defeated you before.
We'll do it again.

34:44.271 --> 34:47.400
Oh, <i>I'm</i> not the one
who's going to destroy your...

34:47.425 --> 34:49.960
happy endings.

34:50.331 --> 34:51.898
Not this time.

34:51.922 --> 34:53.157
Then who is?

34:53.571 --> 34:55.391
You.

34:55.416 --> 35:00.820
You're going to destroy
everyone's happy endings.

35:01.692 --> 35:03.488
You won't divide this family.

35:03.523 --> 35:04.723
Oh, I won't have to.

35:04.831 --> 35:07.948
The people from the
Land of Untold Stories

35:08.160 --> 35:11.763
aren't the only ones with
tales they don't want told.

35:12.136 --> 35:17.002
And when your stories finally play out

35:17.036 --> 35:20.394
[Chuckles]

35:20.419 --> 35:25.525
I'll just sit back and watch you

35:25.550 --> 35:28.852
[Singsongy voice] tear yourselves apart.

35:30.883 --> 35:32.617
[Chuckles]

35:46.029 --> 35:47.996
Regina, it's not your fault.

35:48.250 --> 35:49.548
[Chuckles] Right.

35:49.573 --> 35:51.604
She trapped you. You
didn't have a choice.

35:51.629 --> 35:53.430
Of course I had a choice.

35:54.173 --> 35:55.868
I could have kept the Evil Queen inside,

35:55.893 --> 35:57.161
where she was <i>my</i> problem.

35:57.186 --> 35:59.821
No. This is exactly what she wants.

35:59.911 --> 36:01.488
She want you to doubt yourself.

36:01.512 --> 36:02.727
She's doing a hell of a job.

36:02.752 --> 36:06.127
Look, Regina, this may be new for you,

36:06.152 --> 36:08.159
but I've faced the Evil Queen before,

36:08.184 --> 36:10.519
and I never once did it by running away.

36:10.553 --> 36:13.418
Okay, we have to her head
on, get ahead of her plan.

36:13.443 --> 36:14.845
And how exactly do we do that?

36:14.870 --> 36:16.362
I don't know.

36:16.394 --> 36:18.829
This is the one time
we are going to ask you

36:18.863 --> 36:21.641
to please think like the Evil Queen.

36:21.666 --> 36:22.774
What did she mean when she said

36:22.799 --> 36:25.234
we all have stories we don't want told?

36:29.807 --> 36:30.541
Emma.

36:31.846 --> 36:33.108
Are you okay?

36:33.133 --> 36:34.667
Yeah, I'm fine.

36:38.283 --> 36:39.261
[Sighs]

36:39.286 --> 36:41.888
This isn't how the Count's
story should have ended.

36:42.152 --> 36:43.982
I should have known that
Operation Cobra: Part Two

36:44.007 --> 36:45.599
wouldn't have been as
simple as I thought.

36:45.624 --> 36:47.343
- Why is that?
- Because it's a sequel,

36:47.368 --> 36:49.770
and they're always more
involved than the original.

36:50.188 --> 36:53.857
I'm sorry, mate. I don't understand.

36:53.892 --> 36:55.691
"Empire Strikes Back"?

36:55.723 --> 36:56.807
"Godfather: Part II"?

36:56.832 --> 36:58.899
- What? What?
- "Temple of Doom"?

36:59.066 --> 37:00.466
You know... the best sequels ever.

37:02.034 --> 37:03.897
It's definitely time for a movie night.

37:03.931 --> 37:05.857
When my mom helped everyone
during the first curse,

37:05.882 --> 37:06.882
it was simple.

37:07.101 --> 37:08.797
Those people had been
ripped away from the stories

37:08.822 --> 37:10.656
they <i>wanted</i> to play out.

37:10.685 --> 37:13.153
And these people ran from
their stories for a reason.

37:13.188 --> 37:14.762
And before we can help them,

37:14.787 --> 37:16.254
we need to find out why they ran.

37:17.202 --> 37:18.550
All right. Keep reading.

37:18.575 --> 37:20.877
Right. Then let's get to work.

37:34.210 --> 37:36.143
You all right, mate?

37:36.398 --> 37:37.476
Yeah.

37:37.501 --> 37:39.135
Just gonna get some air.

37:41.216 --> 37:42.983
[Door bells jingle]

37:48.888 --> 37:50.255
How do you like your gift?

37:51.746 --> 37:53.358
I should have known it came from you.

37:55.165 --> 37:57.161
Why'd you give it to me?

37:57.519 --> 37:58.672
Simple.

38:00.098 --> 38:02.043
Like I said,

38:02.128 --> 38:05.931
we all have untold stories
waiting to be played out.

38:06.238 --> 38:09.125
I hate to break it to you...
this one's already been told.

38:09.150 --> 38:10.951
You see, this was a good-luck charm

38:10.976 --> 38:13.778
I wrapped around my father's
wrist before he left our farm.

38:14.293 --> 38:17.887
Oh, you mean the trip where
he left his untimely demise?

38:17.912 --> 38:19.812
You're not gonna get in my head.

38:20.109 --> 38:22.911
I made peace with what happened.

38:23.055 --> 38:24.582
My father succumbed to weakness.

38:24.607 --> 38:26.074
He got drunk.

38:26.099 --> 38:28.565
Because of that, he
died in a cart accident.

38:28.590 --> 38:31.650
Oh, I'm not here because
of your daddy issues.

38:33.510 --> 38:38.379
I'm here to ask you one question.

38:39.629 --> 38:41.839
[Sighs]

38:44.489 --> 38:48.792
Are you sure it was an accident?

38:56.096 --> 38:58.816
[Baby Robin crying]

38:58.841 --> 39:01.114
Shh!

39:01.139 --> 39:03.807
Mommy's coming, sweet pea.

39:04.642 --> 39:06.343
[Rattle shaking]

39:09.380 --> 39:12.616
You like this rattle,
don't you, little one?

39:12.832 --> 39:15.018
My mother used to use it to soothe me.

39:15.053 --> 39:16.215
Mm-hmm.

39:16.240 --> 39:18.007
[Chuckles]

39:19.566 --> 39:22.019
Our mother used that on you?

39:22.161 --> 39:23.928
Yes.

39:23.994 --> 39:27.130
And now it's yours.

39:29.075 --> 39:31.376
Consider it a gift.

39:31.442 --> 39:32.542
For what?

39:34.779 --> 39:39.516
You didn't tell Regina about
our little visit to the vault.

39:39.550 --> 39:43.479
You didn't even tell her I was in town.

39:43.570 --> 39:48.607
You know how much I admire
the ability to keep a secret.

39:48.853 --> 39:50.409
Oh.

39:50.423 --> 39:52.725
So it was a test.

39:52.759 --> 39:54.727
And, here, I thought you
were different than Regina.

39:54.761 --> 39:59.865
I am, because, unlike her,
I will never doubt you again.

40:00.671 --> 40:01.934
[Chuckles]

40:02.388 --> 40:05.404
So, when you said I'd
get my sister back...

40:05.429 --> 40:08.368
[Sighs] you didn't mean Regina, did you?

40:08.393 --> 40:11.271
I'm the sister you want, Zelena.

40:11.544 --> 40:14.413
I know this because...

40:14.447 --> 40:16.638
you're just like me...

40:16.662 --> 40:20.412
You would never settle for less.

40:20.437 --> 40:24.242
And Regina is quite literally...

40:26.300 --> 40:28.335
the lesser of two evils.

40:28.447 --> 40:29.514
[Chuckles]

40:30.729 --> 40:31.628
[Knock on door]

40:33.123 --> 40:34.090
Archie.

40:34.124 --> 40:36.627
I'm sorry if I was out
of line this morning.

40:36.652 --> 40:37.320
I think you're right.

40:37.345 --> 40:39.228
I think I probably should tell my family

40:39.299 --> 40:41.767
about the visions or dreams or whatever.

40:41.864 --> 40:42.597
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

40:42.631 --> 40:45.834
But I can't. At least not yet.

40:46.977 --> 40:50.672
Does this have anything to do
with your rival, the Evil Queen?

40:50.706 --> 40:52.007
- You heard?
- Yeah.

40:52.032 --> 40:53.351
Bashful was my 4:00,

40:53.376 --> 40:56.111
and he likes to talk about
current events before diving in.

40:56.145 --> 40:58.146
She said she was gonna
tear us all apart.

40:58.180 --> 41:01.149
She's already tried to
blacken Regina's heart.

41:01.183 --> 41:03.852
Are you worried that
she's gonna s-succeed?

41:03.886 --> 41:09.782
I'm worried about who
might be in the hood.

41:09.807 --> 41:12.742
In my dream, I'm worried
about who might kill me.

41:12.995 --> 41:15.797
Wh... who, Emma? Wh...
who's gonna kill you?

41:17.600 --> 41:20.802
The one person who wasn't
with my family in the vision...

41:22.597 --> 41:24.047
Regina.

41:25.212 --> 41:29.448
Are you worried about
Regina or the Evil Queen?

41:32.114 --> 41:33.982
I don't know.
