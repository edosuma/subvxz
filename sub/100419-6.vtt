02:44.440 --> 02:45.520
I need your help.

02:46.720 --> 02:48.880
Martin Killane has asked
to see you. In fact...

02:48.960 --> 02:50.600
he will only talk to you.

03:12.760 --> 03:14.960
I did a terrible thing a long time ago.

03:17.480 --> 03:20.320
And before what has to happen begins...

03:22.280 --> 03:23.800
I wanted to tell you about it.

03:26.040 --> 03:27.920
Because you're the only person I trust.

03:29.800 --> 03:30.880
Does that make sense?

03:35.520 --> 03:36.440
Thank you.

03:44.640 --> 03:47.240
You've seen photos of my wife, Natasha.

03:51.040 --> 03:54.160
I thought I was the luckiest man alive
when she came along.

03:54.240 --> 03:56.560
She was so gorgeous and...

03:57.720 --> 04:00.520
challenging and demanding.

04:02.480 --> 04:04.320
She turned my world upside down.

04:05.680 --> 04:07.960
I adored her, I completely adored her.

04:10.360 --> 04:12.240
But, uh, she needs...

04:12.800 --> 04:14.280
attention, and...

04:15.480 --> 04:17.520
I'm a cop working all hours.

04:19.600 --> 04:21.240
So she meets other men.

04:22.560 --> 04:24.200
And I can't handle it.

04:24.280 --> 04:26.480
And I say, "That's it, that's it." And...

04:27.400 --> 04:29.480
she says, "No.

04:30.080 --> 04:32.560
They're nothing. You're one, the only one.

04:33.680 --> 04:34.840
It's you and me.

04:36.720 --> 04:37.920
Let's have a baby."

04:39.440 --> 04:40.440
And we do.

04:42.160 --> 04:44.240
And when Chris comes along...

04:45.280 --> 04:46.880
this baby changes everything.

04:46.960 --> 04:48.040
I'm besotted.

04:48.840 --> 04:52.560
I'm in a constant state of amazement.

04:54.760 --> 04:56.400
Raising this child...

04:57.640 --> 04:59.080
that's the meaning of life.

05:01.960 --> 05:02.840
But...

05:03.840 --> 05:06.240
Natasha can't handle it.

05:07.360 --> 05:08.680
She finds it hard.

05:10.440 --> 05:12.640
So I'm important.

05:12.880 --> 05:15.160
And... to have this...

05:15.680 --> 05:18.480
adorable toddler running towards me,

05:18.560 --> 05:20.240
arms out every time I come home...

05:24.560 --> 05:27.720
Then one time, one day,
I come home early and...

05:28.040 --> 05:30.400
Natasha has all these bags packed.

05:32.240 --> 05:33.560
She's standing there.

05:33.960 --> 05:35.480
I've caught her, right?

05:37.240 --> 05:39.080
And she tells me...

05:39.800 --> 05:42.320
that she's leaving me, she's going,

05:42.400 --> 05:44.680
and she's taking Chris with her.

05:50.080 --> 05:51.880
Oh, the things she said to me.

05:54.080 --> 05:57.040
And I'm lost for words, I'm speechless.

05:58.960 --> 06:00.680
And then she grabs Chris...

06:01.960 --> 06:05.080
and starts to go, is actually going,
and I lash out.

06:08.600 --> 06:10.400
And Natasha goes down.

06:11.640 --> 06:13.240
She goes down, and...

06:15.160 --> 06:17.160
I pick up Chris and...

06:17.280 --> 06:20.040
go into the other room
and close the door.

06:21.760 --> 06:22.800
And I...

06:23.520 --> 06:26.560
I really thought I was going back
to reason with her.

06:27.280 --> 06:31.360
But as soon as she spits out at me
that she's taking Chris...

06:33.760 --> 06:36.240
I land a second, a third,

06:36.320 --> 06:38.720
fourth, a fifth blow and...

06:39.960 --> 06:40.920
And...

06:44.480 --> 06:45.520
And it's over.

06:49.840 --> 06:50.800
It was over.

06:57.800 --> 06:59.440
Would you do the like of that...

07:00.520 --> 07:01.840
to save the one you loved?

07:02.320 --> 07:03.360
Like Corinne, say?

07:04.640 --> 07:06.280
Because the terrible thing is...

07:08.160 --> 07:10.200
I never thought I'd be capable
of such a thing.

07:12.520 --> 07:15.280
I... But I know now

07:15.360 --> 07:18.640
that I would do the same again
to keep that child.

07:22.280 --> 07:24.480
And what followed wasn't hard.

07:24.880 --> 07:27.560
I've been on so many murder cases, I...

07:28.080 --> 07:30.160
I know how to hide a body.

07:31.240 --> 07:32.160
Wrap it up,

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
seal it so it's airtight, open up a wall,

07:37.480 --> 07:39.160
put the body in the wall,

07:39.240 --> 07:41.800
patch it up so it's good as new.

07:42.960 --> 07:43.800
Hmm.

07:48.400 --> 07:49.480
Did nobody...

07:50.480 --> 07:51.360
miss her?

07:54.080 --> 07:57.400
Yeah, well,
she bought train tickets.

07:57.480 --> 07:58.360
She...

07:59.840 --> 08:01.120
had withdrawn cash.

08:01.320 --> 08:04.800
She'd even told people that she was going.

08:06.440 --> 08:08.520
Leaving the child behind, that...

08:09.520 --> 08:11.040
that really shocked people.

08:11.120 --> 08:13.240
What kind of mother does the like of that?

08:13.320 --> 08:14.160
But...

08:15.640 --> 08:19.680
I pulled people over to my side,
so I was never suspected.

08:19.760 --> 08:25.680
I gave up the force and threw myself
into being a full-time dad,

08:26.280 --> 08:27.320
which I loved.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.960
You know what young kids are like.

08:30.600 --> 08:31.960
They can never have enough.

08:32.880 --> 08:34.240
And I gave everything.

08:36.480 --> 08:37.800
I gave everything.

08:40.600 --> 08:41.920
I wanted to.

08:43.840 --> 08:45.600
And the irony is...

08:47.160 --> 08:51.000
that child I raised all on my own
hasn't spoken to me for years.

08:55.440 --> 08:56.640
What about Corinne?

09:01.880 --> 09:02.800
What?

09:04.400 --> 09:05.400
Where is she?

09:07.640 --> 09:09.720
When the body was found, you...

09:10.280 --> 09:12.400
looked at me and you said, "I'm sorry."

09:14.680 --> 09:15.840
For using you.

09:16.360 --> 09:17.240
Yes.

09:18.840 --> 09:20.400
Why else would I say that?

09:22.640 --> 09:24.400
This is about me

09:24.480 --> 09:27.320
and what I did to Natasha.

09:27.880 --> 09:30.240
It's about me and Natasha

09:30.320 --> 09:32.240
and... and...

09:32.680 --> 09:33.680
and Chris.

09:34.240 --> 09:36.640
I thought you'd understand that.

09:37.520 --> 09:39.120
I'll tell you what I understand.

09:41.640 --> 09:43.680
You raised your child

09:43.760 --> 09:44.640
in a house

09:45.240 --> 09:48.280
with the corpse of their mother
buried in the walls.

09:49.640 --> 09:51.240
That's what I understand.

09:53.680 --> 09:55.400
-Adam...
-No.

10:00.320 --> 10:01.400
Adam!

10:08.120 --> 10:09.200
Able to share anything?

10:10.320 --> 10:11.360
Um...

10:12.520 --> 10:14.440
I need to speak to DS Griffin.

10:15.320 --> 10:16.760
Right. Get Killane back to his cell.

10:16.840 --> 10:19.120
Yeah. DS Griffin wants to know
where Katz is.

10:21.240 --> 10:23.240
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you so much.

10:23.320 --> 10:24.440
Good to meet you.

10:27.120 --> 10:28.520
Good to meet you. Lovely.

10:30.560 --> 10:32.120
- Well done.
-Thank you.

10:35.400 --> 10:37.800
Those two bishops
are church commissioners.

10:38.280 --> 10:39.120
And...

10:41.240 --> 10:43.720
I think they're gonna endorse the app
in time for the launch.

10:43.800 --> 10:45.600
-Well, that's wonderful.
-Oh, huge.

10:45.680 --> 10:48.360
Ethical investing within everyone's reach.

10:48.440 --> 10:50.800
Imagine, local churches
as collection points

10:50.880 --> 10:53.360
so the poorest parishioner
can share in wealth creation.

10:53.880 --> 10:55.520
It's the parable of the widow's might,

10:55.600 --> 10:57.440
but where the widow receives
as well as gives.

10:58.080 --> 10:59.480
Couldn't be better.

10:59.560 --> 11:00.520
Mr. Katz?

11:01.000 --> 11:02.800
-Hello.
-Oh, Mrs. Powers.

11:02.880 --> 11:04.200
Can I get you a tea or anything?

11:04.280 --> 11:05.600
Uh, no, sweetheart.

11:05.680 --> 11:08.480
No, Patrick isn't staying.
It's just a flying visit. But thank you.

11:10.960 --> 11:12.800
-I'll be right in.
-Oh, right.

11:13.200 --> 11:15.040
See you next time, Mr. Katz.

11:15.120 --> 11:16.360
Good to see you, Mrs. Powers.

11:18.880 --> 11:19.840
And...

11:20.640 --> 11:23.200
is my head of security
also the bearer of good news?

11:23.280 --> 11:24.160
Is...

11:25.040 --> 11:26.000
everything resolved?

11:26.080 --> 11:26.960
I'm working on it.

11:27.440 --> 11:28.320
What do you mean?

11:29.040 --> 11:31.480
Patrick, Ethical Share
isn't only a company, it's my life.

11:31.560 --> 11:32.560
We're launching my life--

11:32.640 --> 11:35.800
Mr. Powers, your company's gonna be paying
for my daughter's medical care,

11:35.880 --> 11:37.920
so I know how much this matters.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.720
Then please tell me you've done your job
and shut these blackmailers down.

11:41.800 --> 11:43.040
I've bought us some time.

11:43.120 --> 11:44.200
What? How?

11:45.400 --> 11:48.720
I got a key fob
from a missing teacher's classroom

11:48.960 --> 11:51.160
and planted it for my colleagues to find,
which they did.

11:51.800 --> 11:53.920
It's been the perfect diversion. But...

11:54.880 --> 11:56.600
you didn't tell me the whole story,
did you?

12:01.120 --> 12:03.520
This details every communication
and liaison

12:03.600 --> 12:05.360
with that girl
whose mother was blackmailed.

12:05.440 --> 12:06.960
Thank you. Ta.

12:11.360 --> 12:13.160
You didn't just see her once or twice.

12:14.360 --> 12:16.080
You saw her 34 times.

12:16.160 --> 12:17.880
Can they identify me through this?

12:17.960 --> 12:20.960
Not if I get to her first, which I will.
But for that, I need two grand.

12:21.040 --> 12:23.960
For what? Nothing traceable.
We can't have any scandal.

12:24.040 --> 12:25.600
No, it's to pay a banking contact

12:25.680 --> 12:28.000
who can track the Heidi Doyle
blackmail money for us.

12:28.080 --> 12:29.760
Then, as soon as I know who to call on,

12:29.840 --> 12:31.160
the problem is over.

12:31.240 --> 12:32.720
Why? What will you do?

12:35.040 --> 12:36.080
I'm a policeman.

12:36.600 --> 12:38.240
They're blackmailers.

12:38.320 --> 12:39.640
They'll simply melt away.

12:56.560 --> 12:57.480
What did Killane say?

12:58.840 --> 12:59.960
It's his wife, Natasha.

13:00.960 --> 13:01.840
Killed way back.

13:02.720 --> 13:03.560
By Killane?

13:05.080 --> 13:06.280
She was gonna leave him.

13:09.120 --> 13:12.000
When I saw the body in the wall,
I thought it was Corinne.

13:16.520 --> 13:18.600
Your wife's car has been found up
by the airport.

13:18.680 --> 13:21.400
We're watching it,
seeing if anyone returns to it, but...

13:23.120 --> 13:25.200
-Come with me. Let's take a look.
-You sure about this?

13:25.280 --> 13:26.280
Yeah.

13:26.360 --> 13:27.440
You take over here.

13:29.320 --> 13:30.160
Come with me.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.760
So back to Olivia's then, yeah?

13:41.840 --> 13:43.120
I think we should.

13:43.200 --> 13:45.520
I mean, her mom's saying
she's in hospital when she's not.

13:45.880 --> 13:48.120
-Chucking out all those medicines.
-And rat poison.

13:48.600 --> 13:49.800
Don't forget the rat poison.

13:49.880 --> 13:52.360
We can just slip it in casually, you know?

13:53.080 --> 13:54.320
Medicines, yeah.

13:54.880 --> 13:56.960
And do you have a rodent problem
at the moment?

13:57.040 --> 14:00.320
Look, I just want you to hear Olivia admit
that she's the one who told me

14:00.400 --> 14:03.880
you posted the Ella photos, so then
you know why I spiked your joint, okay?

14:07.840 --> 14:10.160
Mom, back in an hour or so, okay?

14:10.240 --> 14:11.080
Okay.

14:11.840 --> 14:13.800
Oh, Thomas,
your dad's asked me to feed Ryan,

14:13.880 --> 14:15.840
-so if you wanna come back for dinner?
-Uh...

14:15.920 --> 14:17.040
Yeah, okay, thanks.

14:17.120 --> 14:18.960
Remind me to never get in your car.

14:25.480 --> 14:26.560
You all right?

14:28.840 --> 14:30.160
You know, before Corinne...

14:31.400 --> 14:32.840
faked her pregnancy...

14:34.880 --> 14:36.600
I had taken on a case

14:36.680 --> 14:38.520
with another lawyer, a woman.

14:39.800 --> 14:40.720
And...

14:42.320 --> 14:44.160
we spent a lot of time together...

14:44.680 --> 14:45.560
you know...

14:46.080 --> 14:47.120
got pretty close.

14:50.160 --> 14:51.840
It didn't occur to me at the time, but...

14:53.000 --> 14:54.040
maybe Corinne...

14:55.000 --> 14:57.960
thought that my attention was elsewhere
and that's why she did what she did.

14:59.960 --> 15:01.440
Maybe, maybe not.

15:02.560 --> 15:03.400
Who knows?

15:06.080 --> 15:07.120
Look, we all...

15:08.120 --> 15:10.080
mess up relationships.

15:12.080 --> 15:14.280
We're not trying to hurt the ones we love.

15:16.120 --> 15:17.120
But we do.

15:21.320 --> 15:23.280
It's up there, that's where it's parked.

15:47.440 --> 15:48.520
Yeah, that's...

15:49.080 --> 15:50.120
that's her car.

15:50.640 --> 15:52.720
Did your wife take her passport with her?

15:53.920 --> 15:56.040
I wouldn't have thought so, no.

15:56.120 --> 15:59.640
And did you or she ever park here
when using the airport?

16:00.720 --> 16:01.600
Never.

16:02.360 --> 16:03.640
Maybe she ran out of charge.

16:05.080 --> 16:06.920
We need to look in the boot first.

16:08.600 --> 16:09.440
Oh, um...

16:09.880 --> 16:11.320
I've got a key. Hang on.

16:12.400 --> 16:13.240
Okay.

16:13.760 --> 16:15.680
I'm sorry, you need to stay there.

16:24.120 --> 16:25.240
Wow.

16:26.360 --> 16:28.040
It's the neatest boot I've ever seen.

16:28.920 --> 16:29.960
Eh?

16:30.040 --> 16:31.880
-Oh, it's just lovely.
-All yours.

16:31.960 --> 16:34.480
-She loves it.
-It's so clean.

16:42.880 --> 16:43.880
Anything unusual?

16:44.840 --> 16:46.200
What's that on the back seat?

16:50.160 --> 16:52.080
Yeah, that's Corinne's earring.

16:52.160 --> 16:53.800
Ones that I bought her.

16:56.920 --> 16:58.040
What's it doing there?

16:58.360 --> 16:59.560
Why would it be there?

16:59.640 --> 17:01.800
First things first,
would she be wearing them?

17:01.880 --> 17:03.920
Yes, she never takes them off.
She loves them.

17:14.600 --> 17:17.680
-Adam, look, I'm sorry. I know--
-Please, just find her for me.

17:20.400 --> 17:21.680
Right, Olivia...

17:21.760 --> 17:24.080
I need you to tell Mike
what you told me at the rave.

17:24.160 --> 17:25.400
'Cause he doesn't believe me.

17:25.840 --> 17:26.880
That's a problem for us.

17:26.960 --> 17:28.800
I don't think this is the way
to go about this.

17:28.880 --> 17:29.840
It's the only way.

17:30.680 --> 17:31.680
Olivia...

17:32.080 --> 17:33.760
you were looking for me, right?

17:34.480 --> 17:36.400
You came and found me, yes?

17:36.960 --> 17:37.840
Daisy?

17:38.640 --> 17:39.480
Daisy?

17:40.920 --> 17:41.760
What?

17:41.840 --> 17:44.320
-Those Ella photos posted online--
-Yeah, they're not of Ella.

17:44.400 --> 17:46.560
No, I know. But it was Mike.

17:48.440 --> 17:50.640
At school, by the lockers,
everyone's getting their stuff.

17:50.720 --> 17:53.680
And he's to the side, looking at
these gross close-up porn shots.

17:54.360 --> 17:56.040
Then he slips it in Ella's bag,
walks off.

17:56.600 --> 17:58.480
And now he gets his own phone
out of his pocket.

17:58.880 --> 18:00.800
It was Mike. I saw him.

18:02.920 --> 18:04.200
Why would you say that?

18:05.040 --> 18:06.000
Okay, that's it.

18:06.560 --> 18:08.080
Get in the car.
We didn't come for this.

18:08.160 --> 18:09.760
I did. We're sorting things.

18:09.840 --> 18:11.560
This doesn't sort anything!

18:11.640 --> 18:12.720
Get in the car.

18:14.880 --> 18:15.720
Come on.

18:16.720 --> 18:17.560
Daisy!

18:26.360 --> 18:28.000
Look, nothing bad's gonna happen, okay?

18:29.040 --> 18:30.360
I promise, I give you my word.

18:31.560 --> 18:33.880
But that is what I said
to Daisy that night.

18:35.080 --> 18:35.920
And...

18:37.400 --> 18:40.120
it was such a terrible thing
to say and do because...

18:41.120 --> 18:43.640
I took Ella's phone
and sent those pictures.

18:46.240 --> 18:47.240
It was me.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
I did it.

18:50.080 --> 18:51.120
All of it.

18:51.520 --> 18:52.360
But why?

18:52.880 --> 18:54.120
I saw Mike...

18:54.840 --> 18:55.920
talking to Ella.

18:56.480 --> 18:57.800
Well, even so...

19:00.040 --> 19:01.120
I like Mike.

19:02.480 --> 19:04.640
I like him and I thought, "Oh, he's...

19:05.080 --> 19:06.120
gone off with Ella."

19:06.880 --> 19:08.520
Ella-- Ella's 14.

19:08.600 --> 19:10.800
But I wanted him to look at me.

19:11.360 --> 19:12.640
He doesn't know what I feel.

19:12.720 --> 19:13.760
Okay, listen--

19:13.840 --> 19:15.680
No, I've hurt so many people.

19:15.760 --> 19:18.000
And it can't be put right, how can it?

19:19.000 --> 19:20.600
The time... My mom will be back.

19:20.680 --> 19:21.680
And if you're here...

19:21.760 --> 19:22.960
-You can't be.
-Okay.

19:23.040 --> 19:24.040
You can't be here.

19:24.120 --> 19:25.920
-Okay, I'm going.
-You have to go.

19:26.920 --> 19:27.840
But we need to talk.

19:29.360 --> 19:30.720
And I didn't come here for this.

19:32.880 --> 19:34.360
I came to see if you were all right.

19:36.800 --> 19:39.920
'Cause I know you were here this morning
when your mom said you were in hospital.

19:40.760 --> 19:42.200
I'm going, okay?

19:42.280 --> 19:43.280
But I mean that.

19:44.320 --> 19:45.320
I just wanna help.

19:50.840 --> 19:52.760
There's something else
I can tell you.

19:55.680 --> 19:56.680
Look, um...

19:57.800 --> 20:00.720
Do you remember, I told you there was
a blond woman with the stranger?

20:01.280 --> 20:02.360
She was driving the car?

20:02.440 --> 20:04.400
Right. Well, her name's Ingrid Prisby.

20:04.480 --> 20:06.800
Ingrid Prisby or Gabrielle Dunbar.

20:07.520 --> 20:09.760
Killane tracked her
to Windsor Lock Business Park.

20:09.840 --> 20:12.520
She's a... private investigator.

20:12.960 --> 20:15.480
And I saw her there,
but she... she drove off and I lost her.

20:15.560 --> 20:16.560
That's all I know.

20:17.160 --> 20:18.720
Martin Killane helped you?

20:19.360 --> 20:21.400
He's the only one
that's been helping me until now.

20:22.280 --> 20:24.720
So how will getting to the stranger
help find your wife?

20:26.280 --> 20:28.640
All of this started with her.

20:30.040 --> 20:31.720
I think she knows more.

20:31.800 --> 20:32.920
She has to.

20:34.960 --> 20:35.920
I'll look into it.

20:37.360 --> 20:38.200
Thanks.

20:57.640 --> 20:58.880
- <i>Hello?</i>
-Wes.

20:58.960 --> 21:00.000
<i>Hello, Jo.</i>

21:28.760 --> 21:29.680
Can I take it?

22:08.680 --> 22:10.440
The Corinne Price key fob...

22:11.200 --> 22:13.280
found at the Heidi Doyle crime scene...

22:14.240 --> 22:15.320
who found it?

22:16.160 --> 22:17.560
And why isn't it logged?

22:21.920 --> 22:23.400
Hello?!

22:25.280 --> 22:27.720
Adam Price's wife
didn't take her passport.

22:31.520 --> 22:32.880
-Hey.
-Hey.

22:34.800 --> 22:35.640
What's happened?

22:37.800 --> 22:39.080
We found Corinne's car.

22:40.280 --> 22:42.520
And one of her earrings
was in the back seat.

22:47.680 --> 22:48.600
Thanks for having Ryan.

22:50.080 --> 22:52.360
It's a full house. Thomas is here too.

22:52.440 --> 22:53.440
Come inside. Come inside.

22:53.520 --> 22:54.360
Thanks.

22:55.200 --> 22:57.280
I think that Mike is gonna be pretty...

22:59.760 --> 23:00.800
Hey.

23:00.880 --> 23:02.080
Ryan's been brilliant.

23:02.160 --> 23:04.160
We're about to eat. How's that?

23:04.240 --> 23:05.200
Uh...

23:07.360 --> 23:08.880
Yeah, sounds great, actually.

23:10.040 --> 23:11.680
<i>What I was wondering is...</i>

23:12.160 --> 23:14.800
if either of you have seen this before.

23:14.880 --> 23:17.280
It was found on the floor in this area.

23:17.840 --> 23:19.800
No. I swept up in here.
I'd have seen that.

23:20.920 --> 23:21.760
Sorry.

23:21.840 --> 23:23.080
No, no worries.

23:23.440 --> 23:24.920
What about the days...

23:25.000 --> 23:26.280
leading up to her murder?

23:26.360 --> 23:27.960
Did you notice anything unusual?

23:28.720 --> 23:29.560
Mm.

23:29.640 --> 23:31.080
How was Heidi that last night?

23:32.760 --> 23:33.760
In great spirits.

23:34.600 --> 23:36.960
I think she was on the phone
to her husband and,

23:37.040 --> 23:39.040
you know, she was laughing. And...

23:39.120 --> 23:40.240
you know...

23:40.320 --> 23:41.440
And the night before?

23:42.320 --> 23:43.960
We were making your cake.

23:44.720 --> 23:45.880
Cake, of course.

23:47.560 --> 23:49.560
She didn't seem concerned about anything?

23:51.480 --> 23:53.760
No mention of money worries?

23:55.480 --> 23:58.160
Did she say she was gonna
see her daughter the next day?

23:58.240 --> 23:59.480
Kimberley? No.

24:00.120 --> 24:02.000
She spent the whole evening
laughing and joking.

24:02.440 --> 24:04.600
Even in the car park
with those two women.

24:04.680 --> 24:05.720
-Yeah, that's right.
-Yeah.

24:06.240 --> 24:07.920
What women? What car park? When?

24:10.320 --> 24:12.160
She was parked here.

24:12.680 --> 24:14.080
And the two women were here.

24:14.720 --> 24:16.240
We were over there.

24:16.320 --> 24:17.200
And...

24:20.440 --> 24:23.840
- <i>Hello, boss.</i>
<i>-</i>Wes, Renton Street car park.

24:23.920 --> 24:25.720
So Renton Street car park?

24:25.800 --> 24:28.800
I need the footage
from their CCTV cameras.

24:28.880 --> 24:31.920
<i>-When?</i>
-The night before Heidi Doyle's murder.

24:32.480 --> 24:35.000
Between 1900 hours and midnight.

24:35.080 --> 24:36.480
Looking for what?

24:36.560 --> 24:38.360
<i>Two women meeting Heidi Doyle.</i>

24:38.440 --> 24:39.800
Okay, I'm on it.

24:42.160 --> 24:43.600
It's a council car park, isn't it?

24:43.680 --> 24:45.160
Uh, yeah.

24:45.640 --> 24:47.000
Weren't you just clocking off?

24:47.400 --> 24:48.320
Oh, you're okay.

24:48.400 --> 24:49.360
I wanna help.

24:57.200 --> 24:58.880
<i>Hello, Cedarfield Council.</i>

25:04.960 --> 25:06.120
All right, Ryan,

25:06.200 --> 25:07.600
straight to bed, it's half eleven.

25:08.680 --> 25:11.400
-I haven't done my homework.
-It's all right, I'll write a note.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.120
Dad, I've got loads of homework.

25:14.200 --> 25:15.360
I've got loads of notes.

25:23.880 --> 25:24.840
Here you go.

25:26.080 --> 25:27.760
Bloody hell.

25:29.240 --> 25:31.320
Listen, we can do this in shifts,
if you like.

25:31.840 --> 25:33.240
Hour on, hour off.

25:33.320 --> 25:34.400
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

25:35.520 --> 25:38.400
I'm all caffeined up anyway so go,
get your head down.

25:39.760 --> 25:41.280
I'll wake you up in an hour, yeah?

25:42.440 --> 25:43.440
Legend.

26:07.200 --> 26:09.720
Come on, mate, it's bedtime. It's late.

26:09.800 --> 26:12.560
I know. But can I talk you
about something?

26:12.640 --> 26:14.160
Yeah, of course, anything.

26:15.560 --> 26:16.440
Okay.

26:21.960 --> 26:23.880
-Has Mom gone off with someone?
-What?

26:23.960 --> 26:25.760
What are you talking about? No.

26:25.840 --> 26:27.840
But isn't that why
most marriages break up?

26:28.560 --> 26:32.120
I know it's lots of other things as well,
but that's what happens in the end, right?

26:32.840 --> 26:34.680
People have affairs
and then it gets serious.

26:34.760 --> 26:36.080
Your mom is not having an affair.

26:36.160 --> 26:37.760
People often don't know, do they?

26:38.120 --> 26:40.360
Maybe it was someone
at that teachers' conference.

26:40.440 --> 26:41.280
No.

26:43.280 --> 26:44.720
Your mom would never do that, ever.

26:45.200 --> 26:46.920
-As in ever.
-Dad.

26:47.320 --> 26:49.480
It happens all the time.

26:50.600 --> 26:52.440
Why do you think Daisy's mom
and dad split up?

26:52.960 --> 26:56.680
He went off with someone and I just
think that's what's happening here.

26:58.200 --> 27:00.040
I think Mom's gone off with someone else.

27:07.480 --> 27:09.000
Where are you right now?

27:40.440 --> 27:42.440
It's really crap quality.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.720
Let's try some facial recognition then.

27:45.840 --> 27:47.040
To recognize what?

27:47.520 --> 27:49.520
Can't make out their faces. It's...

27:50.640 --> 27:51.760
It's too grainy.

27:52.760 --> 27:53.880
We went through everything.

27:55.320 --> 27:57.080
We can read the body language though.

27:58.720 --> 27:59.840
What is it?

28:02.040 --> 28:03.720
What did they just tell you?

28:07.520 --> 28:09.560
Right, we need to find these two women.

28:10.920 --> 28:13.080
One of them could be Ingrid Prisby.

28:13.880 --> 28:15.480
All right, I'll go follow up

28:15.560 --> 28:17.320
at Windsor Lock Business Park.

28:17.400 --> 28:19.560
Okay, but then you get some sleep.

28:23.160 --> 28:24.160
What can I do?

28:24.840 --> 28:25.840
Go and get some sleep.

28:26.880 --> 28:28.120
-I feel fine.

28:37.160 --> 28:39.400
This is the night before your mom died.

28:39.480 --> 28:44.040
After work, she goes to her car
and she meets these two women.

28:45.320 --> 28:46.200
Do you recognize them?

28:48.800 --> 28:50.040
Then this happens.

28:50.760 --> 28:54.520
They hand her something
and it's like her knees go.

28:55.720 --> 28:59.240
Like a reaction to something
she's been shown.

29:09.160 --> 29:11.560
Um, that's for my dad,
'cause he hasn't been sleeping.

29:18.680 --> 29:20.000
Oh, my God.

29:24.040 --> 29:26.280
Mom came to see me that day because...

29:27.760 --> 29:28.720
some people...

29:29.640 --> 29:32.120
Uh, those people, I guess...

29:32.920 --> 29:36.480
they stopped her
and gave her proof that I was...

29:39.680 --> 29:40.920
I've been working for this...

29:42.040 --> 29:43.640
Sugar Baby site.

29:44.880 --> 29:46.440
It's an online thing...

29:47.280 --> 29:48.280
for businessmen.

29:50.800 --> 29:54.680
Um, sometimes it's just going out
for dinner with them, but...

29:56.480 --> 29:57.440
usually...

30:00.880 --> 30:01.920
yeah, it's for sex.

30:03.560 --> 30:06.160
And these... these people
that spoke to Mom,

30:06.240 --> 30:07.440
they knew everything.

30:07.520 --> 30:10.280
They knew I was seeing
three men on a regular basis,

30:10.360 --> 30:12.360
they had all our texts,

30:12.440 --> 30:14.080
they knew when and where we met, and...

30:14.920 --> 30:16.440
And they were blackmailing Heidi?

30:18.560 --> 30:19.880
For £10,000.

30:21.000 --> 30:23.160
But I think... I think she paid it.

30:23.240 --> 30:26.280
So whatever happened later that night,
that's separate, isn't it?

30:27.840 --> 30:29.440
These three men you were seeing...

30:29.520 --> 30:31.200
Uh, I contacted them

30:31.280 --> 30:33.560
as soon as I'd seen Mom
to say I was stopping.

30:34.880 --> 30:36.160
I'm gonna need their details.

30:37.720 --> 30:39.440
We only messaged via the app.

30:39.520 --> 30:41.720
I don't have names or phone numbers.

30:42.040 --> 30:43.480
We just have tags.

30:44.160 --> 30:47.520
Taz, Gander, Malbec40. I'm Kitty.

30:49.120 --> 30:50.880
And when you contacted them?

30:50.960 --> 30:54.040
Two replied, really concerned,

30:54.120 --> 30:55.840
offering help if I needed it.

30:57.240 --> 30:58.320
And the third one?

30:59.240 --> 31:00.080
He didn't reply.

31:01.280 --> 31:04.280
I messaged him twice
because we were meeting that night and...

31:04.880 --> 31:08.120
I went, thinking he hasn't
got the message, but...

31:09.840 --> 31:10.680
he didn't show.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.640
All right, listen,
I'm gonna need you to come in with me.

31:17.520 --> 31:20.000
-Sorry, Ian, did we wake you?
-No, no, no.

31:20.080 --> 31:21.160
Is there news?

31:21.240 --> 31:23.680
No, nothing yet.
We are working day and night though.

31:24.480 --> 31:25.320
I know.

31:36.160 --> 31:38.480
-What have you got?
-So this lead from Adam Price

31:38.560 --> 31:39.920
at Windsor Lock Business Park...

31:40.000 --> 31:41.920
<i>The detective agency... </i>

31:42.320 --> 31:43.800
<i>-Ingrid...</i>
-Ingrid Prisby.

31:43.880 --> 31:45.720
Alias, Gabrielle Dunbar.

31:45.800 --> 31:47.520
So her office has been cleared out.

31:48.400 --> 31:51.280
I've checked into the agency, but it was
set up with an offshore account

31:51.360 --> 31:53.760
so the ID used isn't attached
to any sort of bank account

31:53.840 --> 31:55.040
<i>or National Insurance number.</i>

31:55.120 --> 31:56.960
So it's as if it never existed.

31:57.040 --> 31:57.920
<i>Exactly.</i>

31:58.400 --> 32:00.720
-Right. Thanks.
<i>-See you later.</i>

32:06.000 --> 32:07.760
You know the three men you were seeing?

32:09.560 --> 32:11.400
How would you feel
about contacting them again?

32:13.120 --> 32:13.960
One of them...

32:14.880 --> 32:18.000
might be able to lead us
to the two women who met your mom.

32:21.800 --> 32:23.680
You think the blackmail's linked
to Mom's death?

32:25.200 --> 32:26.560
Almost certainly.

32:32.960 --> 32:34.360
Contact them and say what?

32:36.880 --> 32:37.840
Ask to meet.

32:39.400 --> 32:41.240
Starting with the one who didn't reply.

32:42.000 --> 32:43.200
-Malbec40.
-Yeah.

32:43.800 --> 32:45.360
Do you think he'll show up?

32:45.440 --> 32:46.280
Um...

32:47.040 --> 32:48.080
There was this...

32:48.960 --> 32:49.960
thing he...

32:51.200 --> 32:53.680
he always pesters me to do with him.

32:55.440 --> 32:56.720
Which I don't give in to.

33:00.160 --> 33:01.320
I could offer him that.

33:07.160 --> 33:08.920
You'll be protected at all times.

33:13.480 --> 33:14.840
Yes, do it.

33:17.800 --> 33:18.640
Yeah.

33:30.800 --> 33:32.920
-Have a good day, darling.
-Yes.

33:33.000 --> 33:33.880
See you later.

33:52.920 --> 33:55.040
<i>This is Patrick Katz,</i>
<i>I'll call you straight back.</i>

34:14.160 --> 34:15.040
Accept.

34:17.840 --> 34:18.680
<i>Mike?</i>

34:23.600 --> 34:24.480
<i>Mike...</i>

34:31.920 --> 34:33.080
Mike, can you hear me?

34:34.360 --> 34:35.600
Has it stopped?

34:37.120 --> 34:38.120
I think so.

34:39.480 --> 34:41.040
It's happening less.

34:41.120 --> 34:42.640
But every so often...

34:45.000 --> 34:46.560
...I'm back in PCP land.

34:47.320 --> 34:49.760
Remembering things from that night,

34:49.840 --> 34:51.200
things I'd forgotten.

34:52.680 --> 34:54.640
Like killing the alpaca.

34:59.120 --> 35:00.560
I was off my face.

35:02.480 --> 35:04.760
To begin with, me and the alpaca,

35:04.840 --> 35:05.680
<i>we were friends.</i>

35:06.960 --> 35:08.320
<i>Big pals, </i>amigos,

35:08.400 --> 35:10.280
we're going on an adventure.

35:13.520 --> 35:14.640
But then...

35:14.720 --> 35:16.720
I suddenly think it's going to eat me.

35:16.800 --> 35:19.000
I mean, really eat me.

35:21.480 --> 35:22.800
It's looming over me...

35:24.120 --> 35:25.440
with these teeth.

35:27.960 --> 35:29.120
And it's the end.

35:32.440 --> 35:35.160
And I just swing the shovel

35:35.680 --> 35:37.240
as hard as I can.

35:42.600 --> 35:44.240
You don't remember anything else?

35:44.880 --> 35:45.720
No.

35:47.400 --> 35:49.120
But what's freaking me out...

35:49.720 --> 35:51.920
is Dante was hurt that night as well.

35:52.720 --> 35:53.840
He's in a coma...

35:54.440 --> 35:57.600
and I have zero recall
for anything to do with him.

35:59.480 --> 36:02.520
The last Dante memory I have is...

36:03.400 --> 36:04.240
you and him...

36:05.000 --> 36:06.560
going off into the woods.

36:08.480 --> 36:09.880
What happened after that?

36:10.400 --> 36:11.760
Where did you go?

36:11.840 --> 36:13.800
-When was the last time you saw him?

36:13.880 --> 36:14.760
Daisy?

36:14.840 --> 36:15.960
Oh, great.

36:16.560 --> 36:19.120
I know you're still angry with Olivia,
but she's asked to see me.

36:19.200 --> 36:21.360
And I thought I should talk to her,

36:21.440 --> 36:23.720
-before anyone says anything.
-Yeah, sure.

36:23.800 --> 36:24.760
Do it.

36:26.520 --> 36:27.880
Did she just agree to that?

36:28.960 --> 36:29.840
Yeah.

36:31.080 --> 36:32.200
I think she did.

36:42.920 --> 36:44.720
-Wakey! Wakey!

36:44.800 --> 36:46.360
Come on, we're wanted.

36:46.760 --> 36:48.400
-What for?
-We've been called back in.

36:52.040 --> 36:53.480
Oh, God.

36:53.560 --> 36:55.240
-My phone's out of charge.
-Yeah.

36:55.320 --> 36:56.320
Fuck!

36:56.400 --> 36:57.480
Have my charger.

36:58.480 --> 36:59.800
-Thanks.
-Get a move on.

37:00.320 --> 37:02.240
Fucking hell.

37:02.320 --> 37:04.520
Okay, can everyone settle down, please?

37:04.600 --> 37:07.200
And our sleeping beauties,
can you speed it up?

37:08.720 --> 37:12.360
Okay, FindYourSugarBaby.com

37:12.440 --> 37:14.240
is a sex site

37:14.320 --> 37:16.520
matching businessman with young women.

37:16.600 --> 37:18.960
It's essentially prostitution.

37:19.040 --> 37:21.400
And in connection
with the Heidi Doyle murder,

37:21.480 --> 37:23.640
we are after an unknown man

37:23.720 --> 37:25.960
who has arranged to meet this woman

37:26.440 --> 37:28.280
at the Bolitar Hotel.

37:29.360 --> 37:30.680
Straightforward op.

37:30.760 --> 37:33.840
Main priority: protect our source.

37:33.920 --> 37:35.680
Connected to Heidi Doyle how?

37:36.880 --> 37:39.040
Heidi Doyle was blackmailed

37:39.120 --> 37:40.640
to the tune of £10,000

37:40.720 --> 37:44.240
in connection
with this FindYourSugarBaby site.

37:44.800 --> 37:47.920
And this is Heidi's daughter.

37:49.200 --> 37:53.080
Now, the Bolitar Hotel is very popular
with businessmen.

37:53.160 --> 37:57.040
So our target, early 40s,
medium build, smart dark hair,

37:57.120 --> 37:58.560
is hardly gonna stick out.

37:58.640 --> 38:01.600
He probably won't be identified
until he reaches our source.

38:01.680 --> 38:03.040
Know this about him though:

38:03.120 --> 38:05.800
he uses the tag Malbec40,

38:06.560 --> 38:09.440
a tag that the cyber team
have been tracking

38:09.520 --> 38:12.440
for two years over investment scams.

38:12.520 --> 38:15.760
Right, your start positions
in the hotel...

38:16.160 --> 38:17.320
This is bullshit.

38:17.400 --> 38:19.560
So table one, I've got Ben and Neil.

38:19.640 --> 38:21.400
It's like her going off with Adam Price,

38:22.120 --> 38:24.800
husband of our main suspect, on her own.

38:25.600 --> 38:27.320
It's un-fucking-believable.

38:27.400 --> 38:30.440
Katz and Wes, you're at table three.

38:32.080 --> 38:34.640
This is why you don't investigate
the murder of friends.

38:34.720 --> 38:36.320
Table five, Tim and Sal,

38:36.400 --> 38:39.320
Table six, Charlotte and Ted.
Right, we all know what we're doing?

38:40.120 --> 38:41.920
Great.
Thanks very much, everybody.

38:50.280 --> 38:52.880
<i>Hi, this is Larry Powers.</i>
<i>Leave a message and I'll call you back.</i>

39:19.600 --> 39:20.960
Get off your phone, will you?

39:22.080 --> 39:23.400
I'm fitting in.

39:25.600 --> 39:26.600
What are you doing?

39:53.480 --> 39:54.960
Get us another drink, will you?

39:55.040 --> 39:57.120
-Proper one this time.
-We're on duty.

39:57.200 --> 39:58.280
Yeah, in a bar.

39:59.880 --> 40:01.160
When is the target due?

40:02.520 --> 40:03.560
Five minutes.

40:04.320 --> 40:05.320
I'll get one.

40:12.360 --> 40:13.600
Two double vodkas.

40:13.680 --> 40:14.800
-Ice and lemon?
-No.

40:38.960 --> 40:39.880
Fuck.

40:45.320 --> 40:46.680
Knife! Knife!

40:46.760 --> 40:48.800
-Do not resist!

40:48.880 --> 40:49.880
Shut up!

40:49.960 --> 40:51.120
Get off me!

40:51.600 --> 40:52.600
What is this?!

40:53.440 --> 40:54.440
Get off me!

40:56.600 --> 40:57.600
What are you doing?

41:00.560 --> 41:02.280
Get off of me! Get off!

41:02.360 --> 41:03.880
-No. No, isn't him.
-No?

41:04.800 --> 41:05.800
I thought I saw a knife.

41:05.880 --> 41:07.200
There's nothing!

41:07.280 --> 41:09.440
-I thought he had a knife.
-Just get out of my sight!

41:09.520 --> 41:11.480
No, no, actually no. Stand down.

41:11.560 --> 41:13.360
I'm sending you home,
don't come in tomorrow.

41:13.440 --> 41:14.320
Jo--

41:14.400 --> 41:15.360
Don't call me Jo!

41:16.520 --> 41:18.360
You need to step back
from this, seriously.

41:19.040 --> 41:20.840
He's just done
what any of us would've done.

41:21.320 --> 41:22.840
This is too personal for you.

41:23.360 --> 41:26.160
Don't you ever, ever
have your phone turned off to me.

41:26.240 --> 41:28.480
-Who do you think you're talking to?
<i>-Shut up.</i>

41:28.560 --> 41:29.800
Shut up and listen.

41:30.840 --> 41:33.560
The blackmailers I was trying
to track through the bank....

41:34.280 --> 41:35.880
My contact couldn't trace them.

41:36.800 --> 41:37.680
So what do we do now?

41:37.760 --> 41:39.000
I'll find another way.

41:41.360 --> 41:42.200
Let's wrap this up.

41:44.360 --> 41:46.080
Dante Gunnarsson's just come round.

41:46.160 --> 41:47.680
-Let me go. I can--
-I'm fine.

41:52.200 --> 41:53.360
All right!

41:54.560 --> 41:55.840
All right! All right!

41:58.360 --> 42:00.280
Leaving Killane's house, I understand.

42:01.040 --> 42:04.000
The surrounding houses, okay,
but the whole fucking site?!

42:05.680 --> 42:07.280
Stopping any demolition?!

42:07.360 --> 42:09.680
This is costing me a fortune.
They have no idea.

42:09.760 --> 42:12.560
It's not like I'm some kind of an outsider
or something.

42:12.640 --> 42:14.080
This was my street.

42:14.160 --> 42:16.400
The Killanes were friends.
They were good friends once.

42:16.480 --> 42:17.880
So, due respect,

42:17.960 --> 42:19.720
I understand better than anyone here,

42:19.800 --> 42:21.600
but you don't close down
the whole operation!

42:21.680 --> 42:22.640
I need to talk to you.

42:22.720 --> 42:24.600
Vindictive! It was arbitrary!

42:25.200 --> 42:27.400
That police woman in charge...

42:27.880 --> 42:30.880
There's an attitude.
I've seen it so many times before!

42:30.960 --> 42:34.000
I kid you not, they will take any
opportunity to kick you where it hurts.

42:34.080 --> 42:35.480
-Corinne's missing.
-What?

42:35.560 --> 42:37.120
I said Corinne's missing.

42:38.000 --> 42:39.320
She's gone. She...

42:39.680 --> 42:42.160
She's been gone for about six days.
I don't know where she is.

42:42.240 --> 42:43.760
-Why didn't you say?
-I'm saying it now.

42:44.280 --> 42:46.600
-Okay.
-Look, I need to ask you something.

42:47.200 --> 42:49.200
I didn't know
you owned the company behind this,

42:49.280 --> 42:51.240
-but you think Killane did?
-Yeah, I said so.

42:52.200 --> 42:55.640
Do you think that's why he hired me,
because he thought it might stop you?

42:55.720 --> 42:57.880
Yeah, it's feasible.

42:58.720 --> 43:01.640
-What would that have to do with Corinne?
-Maybe he got to her too.

43:02.880 --> 43:03.720
He was...

43:04.640 --> 43:05.840
helping me look for her.

43:07.280 --> 43:08.840
Kept spouting all this bullshit

43:08.920 --> 43:10.920
about sometimes women leave
and they don't come back,

43:11.000 --> 43:12.840
and all the time his own wife was...

43:15.480 --> 43:17.160
What else has he been lying to me about?

43:18.040 --> 43:20.560
I think he knows something
about Corinne that he's not telling me.

43:20.640 --> 43:21.680
We have to talk to him.

43:21.760 --> 43:23.520
-I know.

43:24.000 --> 43:24.880
Detective.

43:27.320 --> 43:28.280
Why? What's happened?

43:31.080 --> 43:31.920
Which hospital?

43:34.280 --> 43:35.120
What...?

43:36.240 --> 43:37.160
What's happened?

43:37.240 --> 43:39.200
Martin Killane just tried
to commit suicide.

43:40.400 --> 43:41.320
I've gotta go.

44:11.760 --> 44:12.920
Sir, you're not allowed here.

44:13.000 --> 44:15.680
I need to talk to him about my wife.
He was helping me.

44:15.760 --> 44:16.720
He's sedated.

44:22.040 --> 44:23.720
Mom does evening classes.

44:24.440 --> 44:25.720
Maths and biology.

44:26.680 --> 44:27.800
She wants to be a nurse.

44:28.400 --> 44:29.600
I waited till she went.

44:30.880 --> 44:31.880
You're like your mom.

44:32.440 --> 44:33.520
Aren't you?

44:33.600 --> 44:37.320
She's been worried about me being ill
so often, and you're kind...

44:38.240 --> 44:39.200
like her.

44:40.200 --> 44:43.280
She even asked if I wanted to see
another doctor for a second opinion.

44:43.360 --> 44:45.800
I mean, my mom didn't like that.

44:46.320 --> 44:47.680
So we didn't, but...

44:48.120 --> 44:49.160
it was nice of her.

44:51.840 --> 44:53.360
Why are you ill so often?

44:53.800 --> 44:54.800
They don't know.

44:55.560 --> 44:57.000
But what medication are you on?

44:57.080 --> 44:58.400
My mom does that.

44:58.480 --> 44:59.720
It's not much.

45:00.120 --> 45:02.440
Antibiotics and stuff for nausea.

45:03.040 --> 45:05.480
Right, so who takes all the medicine
around here? Your mom?

45:06.520 --> 45:07.440
My mom?

45:08.280 --> 45:09.120
No.

45:10.000 --> 45:12.680
No, look, I wanted to talk
about Ella and Mike.

45:13.280 --> 45:14.600
We will, but listen...

45:16.080 --> 45:18.680
After your mom said you were in hospital
and you weren't,

45:18.760 --> 45:21.640
we saw her throwing out
these boxes of prescription drugs,

45:22.040 --> 45:24.000
and even boxes of rat poison.

45:24.520 --> 45:26.080
And not in your own bin.

45:26.160 --> 45:27.360
What do you mean?

45:29.360 --> 45:30.400
That's my mom.

45:30.480 --> 45:32.560
She does this to check on me.
Hide in there, go.

45:45.040 --> 45:46.760
Dad, what are you doing here?

45:46.840 --> 45:48.160
Hi, darling. How are you?

45:48.240 --> 45:50.160
Listen, I'm not stopping, okay?

45:50.240 --> 45:52.720
-Uh, where are you going?
-I need to get my car.

45:56.880 --> 45:59.440
- Dad, um--
- Sweetheart, listen to me.

45:59.520 --> 46:02.080
Very soon I'm gonna come
into some money, okay?

46:02.160 --> 46:04.240
I'm gonna be around
a lot more for you, I promise.

46:04.840 --> 46:07.440
And you and me are gonna do
such great things together.

46:07.880 --> 46:08.920
I promise you.

47:15.320 --> 47:16.200
Hi.

47:16.800 --> 47:18.000
I'm trying to get through--

47:18.080 --> 47:20.920
No, sorry, this area
is currently closed to visitors.

47:21.000 --> 47:23.560
You'll need to go back down to security
at the front desk

47:23.640 --> 47:25.000
and get authorization.

47:25.080 --> 47:26.080
Sorry, love.

47:53.720 --> 47:55.400
I'm telling you to leave now, sir.

49:01.480 --> 49:02.560
Hey.

49:08.160 --> 49:09.000
Hey.
