00:21.930 --> 00:24.414
(loud clatter)

00:24.508 --> 00:26.275
(gasps)

00:28.863 --> 00:30.446
(loud clatter)

00:33.701 --> 00:35.534
(line ringing)

00:39.598 --> 00:42.115
You're on a landline,
so I've got your address.

00:42.209 --> 00:44.768
Help is on the way.
Can you tell me your name?

00:44.787 --> 00:46.378
My name is Sharlo Darzi.

00:46.605 --> 00:49.456
Oh, my God, I think
they're downstairs.

00:49.608 --> 00:51.291
Okay, Sharlo,
help is on the way.

00:51.443 --> 00:53.627
I just need some information.
Do you live alone?

00:53.721 --> 00:56.630
(whispering):
With my husband, but he's
out of town all week.

00:56.724 --> 00:58.390
I have to get out of here.

00:58.617 --> 01:00.300
<i> JOSH:</i>
<i> You should stay</i>
<i> where you are.</i>

01:00.394 --> 01:02.452
Officers are headed
your way now, Sharlo.

01:02.471 --> 01:04.730
Is there someplace you can hide
until they arrive?

01:06.216 --> 01:07.457
<i> Are you still there?</i>

01:07.626 --> 01:09.717
-(whispering): I'm not waiting.
<i> -Sharlo...</i>

01:09.812 --> 01:12.071
No. I have to get out.

01:12.298 --> 01:13.772
Sharlo, it's better
if you stay put.

01:13.999 --> 01:16.575
No. What if they find me?

01:16.726 --> 01:19.244
<i> I don't have a way</i>
<i> of defending myself.</i>

01:19.396 --> 01:20.913
<i> I'm going to the neighbor's</i>
<i> house.</i>

01:21.064 --> 01:22.472
Okay, can you give me
your gate code?

01:22.566 --> 01:23.898
I'll relay it to the officers.

01:23.918 --> 01:28.145
Oh, no, I don't have
the gate clicker.

01:28.163 --> 01:29.479
<i> It's in my car.</i>

01:29.481 --> 01:31.315
<i> I have to go through</i>
<i> the kitchen.</i>

01:32.318 --> 01:34.668
Sharlo, I need you to stay
inside the house

01:34.762 --> 01:35.928
until the police arrive.

01:36.079 --> 01:37.078
<i> And can you give me</i>
<i> the gate code</i>

01:37.098 --> 01:38.322
<i> so they can make entry?</i>

01:38.456 --> 01:42.008
<i> SHARLO:</i>
<i> The gate code is 9-2-7-3-5-3.</i>

01:42.161 --> 01:43.343
<i> And I'm not waiting for them.</i>

01:43.495 --> 01:45.662
<i> JOSH:</i>
<i> Police are seconds away.</i>

01:45.831 --> 01:48.089
I am not staying in here.

01:48.167 --> 01:49.775
(thud, door creaks)

01:49.926 --> 01:50.943
Oh, God.

01:51.094 --> 01:52.002
Sharlo, what's happening?

01:52.020 --> 01:53.687
(whimpering)

01:53.839 --> 01:55.005
Are they in the house?

01:55.098 --> 01:58.158
(screaming)

02:01.013 --> 02:02.846
-(Sharlo cries out)
-(line goes dead)

02:02.865 --> 02:05.124
(gasps) Sh-Sharlo?

02:05.275 --> 02:07.684
Ma'am, ma'am, are...
Can you hear me?

02:07.703 --> 02:08.869
(siren wailing)

02:09.037 --> 02:10.854
<i> ATHENA:</i>
<i> Dispatch, this is 727-L-30,</i>

02:10.873 --> 02:13.549
<i> approaching the residence now.</i>

02:25.962 --> 02:28.796
(indistinct police radio
chatter)

02:28.816 --> 02:31.441
(sirens approaching)

02:33.712 --> 02:37.214
We responded to
a home invasion in progress.

02:37.232 --> 02:38.899
Found the homeowner unconscious.

02:38.993 --> 02:40.217
And the invaders?

02:40.235 --> 02:41.809
ATHENA:
House is clear.

02:41.829 --> 02:43.553
No signs of forced entry?

02:43.555 --> 02:46.056
ATHENA:
Uh, just some spilled food
in the kitchen.

02:46.149 --> 02:48.392
Dispatch says that
she called from upstairs.

02:48.410 --> 02:50.227
Spotted the intruder
in the kitchen and ran.

02:50.245 --> 02:52.504
She took one hell of a tumble.

02:52.731 --> 02:55.323
-She's breathing
but unresponsive.
-Pulse is elevated.

02:55.417 --> 02:57.250
I mean, something must have
really scared her, right?

02:57.327 --> 02:59.011
You-you sure there's
no one else here?

02:59.238 --> 03:01.430
I'm positive, Detective Buckley.

03:02.165 --> 03:03.849
(Sharlo groaning)

03:04.000 --> 03:05.500
We have to get out.
We have to...

03:05.519 --> 03:07.019
-(loud crack)
-(Sharlo yells, others groan)

03:07.095 --> 03:08.094
That was her pelvis.

03:08.247 --> 03:09.746
Ma'am, I need you to stay still.

03:09.765 --> 03:12.173
A pelvic injury can lead to
internal hemorrhaging.

03:12.267 --> 03:13.525
I'll give you something
for the pain, okay?

03:13.752 --> 03:15.919
Start a line.
Four milligrams of morphine.

03:16.012 --> 03:17.938
I got the splint sheet.

03:18.090 --> 03:19.531
(groaning)

03:19.683 --> 03:21.091
Ma'am, you told 911

03:21.109 --> 03:22.926
that you saw someone
in the kitchen.

03:23.019 --> 03:23.944
Who did you see?

03:24.096 --> 03:25.037
(pained cry)

03:25.206 --> 03:28.707
It wasn't a man. It was...

03:28.934 --> 03:30.191
a monster.

03:30.211 --> 03:33.937
Ma'am, we didn't find anyone
in the house.

03:34.030 --> 03:36.506
It was in the kitchen.

03:43.799 --> 03:46.141
Breadcrumbs.

04:00.908 --> 04:03.492
(chittering)

04:07.897 --> 04:10.082
This is Buckley.

04:10.309 --> 04:13.643
I've apprehended the suspect.

04:13.737 --> 04:15.462
(chuckles)

04:17.649 --> 04:19.424
Oh!

04:19.651 --> 04:21.075
Careful, Buckley.

04:21.169 --> 04:23.077
You could break a hip.

04:23.097 --> 04:25.005
(exhales sharply)

04:26.100 --> 04:29.083
I told my husband
to get rid of the dog door.

04:29.103 --> 04:32.104
We don't even have
a dog anymore.

04:32.331 --> 04:34.014
BOBBY:
Don't worry, ma'am,
no more home invasions.

04:34.166 --> 04:36.441
I've got my top man on the case.

04:36.593 --> 04:37.759
(whirring)

04:37.778 --> 04:39.853
(raccoon chittering)

04:40.005 --> 04:42.364
And stay out.

04:47.346 --> 04:49.121
<i> MADDIE:</i>
<i> When was the last time we had</i>

04:49.348 --> 04:50.847
an entire meal at this table
uninterrupted?

04:50.866 --> 04:52.682
I don't think it's
ever happened.

04:52.776 --> 04:54.034
So what should we do now?

04:54.128 --> 04:55.961
I think I'm gonna have
another cup of coffee.

04:56.112 --> 04:58.705
Oh, uh, Magda,
you don't have to do this.

04:58.799 --> 05:01.216
You're here for Jee, not us.

05:01.969 --> 05:03.468
I can do both. (chuckles)

05:03.637 --> 05:06.880
So, uh, where are you two
off to today?

05:07.032 --> 05:08.198
The park.

05:08.216 --> 05:10.884
A little fresh air,
some sunlight.

05:11.036 --> 05:14.204
It kills potentially
harmful bacteria.

05:14.297 --> 05:16.815
I have your phone numbers.
I've turned on location sharing.

05:17.042 --> 05:18.299
I have power.

05:18.393 --> 05:22.212
I packed all of Jee-yun's
favorite snacks and toys.

05:22.230 --> 05:24.656
It'll be fine. Hmm?

05:24.808 --> 05:26.658
-Say bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

05:26.810 --> 05:28.643
Oh, bye-bye, baby. Love you.

05:28.737 --> 05:29.886
Bye, Mommy.

05:29.905 --> 05:31.221
Bye, Jee, I love you.

05:31.314 --> 05:33.557
You both have
a great day at work. Hmm?

05:33.650 --> 05:34.583
You, too.

05:37.338 --> 05:39.245
-This is weird.
-This is totally weird.

05:39.398 --> 05:41.840
We just let a woman
we've known for less than a week

05:41.991 --> 05:43.008
walk off with our daughter.

05:43.159 --> 05:44.992
We did extensive
background checks.

05:45.012 --> 05:47.161
We called 11 of her references.
Should we have done 12?

05:47.255 --> 05:48.363
We should have done 12.

05:48.423 --> 05:50.182
She can turn off
location sharing.

05:50.333 --> 05:53.000
I sewed a GPS tracker
into her stuffed animal.

05:53.095 --> 05:55.912
(both laugh)

05:56.005 --> 05:57.004
So we're gonna be fine?

05:57.099 --> 05:59.841
-Yeah.
-Okay.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.175
-Ha!
-All right,

06:01.269 --> 06:02.694
let's clean up and go to work.

06:02.921 --> 06:04.938
-Okay.
-(phones chime)

06:05.032 --> 06:07.273
Oh, it's from Magda.

06:07.368 --> 06:10.535
"Leave the dishes.
I'll take care of them."

06:10.612 --> 06:11.761
(phones chime)

06:11.780 --> 06:12.854
"I have a system."

06:12.873 --> 06:15.040
How did she know?

06:16.101 --> 06:17.951
<i> NOAH:</i>
<i> So how's the new nanny?</i>

06:18.103 --> 06:19.436
It's good, I think.

06:19.454 --> 06:21.362
I'm still getting used to
a stranger being in my home,

06:21.382 --> 06:24.290
and she prefers the term
"household manager."

06:24.443 --> 06:25.366
Who does?

06:25.460 --> 06:27.611
-Maddie and Chimney's new nanny.
-Uh...

06:27.704 --> 06:28.795
Household manager.

06:28.889 --> 06:31.281
You hired someone
to manage your household?

06:31.299 --> 06:33.225
Well, now that Chimney and I
are living together,

06:33.410 --> 06:34.968
we're saving on rent,
so we have enough

06:35.120 --> 06:36.302
to hire some help.

06:36.455 --> 06:37.954
-Fire her. Fire her now.
-Why are we already

06:38.047 --> 06:39.122
firing this person?

06:39.141 --> 06:40.732
-Do you know her?
-Don't need to.

06:40.809 --> 06:42.216
It's a stranger in your home.

06:42.385 --> 06:44.294
All in your business.
Recipe for disaster.

06:44.312 --> 06:47.280
It's gonna be fine, I think.

06:48.316 --> 06:49.482
I'm sensing there's
a story here.

06:49.635 --> 06:51.985
The story is called
<i> Downton Abbey.</i>

06:52.137 --> 06:54.304
The help is always watching,
overstepping

06:54.322 --> 06:56.306
and talking smack.
You never seen it?

06:56.308 --> 06:59.325
-No. Now I kind of want to.
-Mm-hmm.

07:00.570 --> 07:03.480
-(door shuts)
<i> -ATHENA: Are we hanging out</i>
<i> or moving back?</i>

07:03.649 --> 07:06.925
-Is the second one an option?
-(chuckles)

07:07.076 --> 07:08.743
I just need a quiet place
to study.

07:08.762 --> 07:10.654
What about your apartment?

07:10.672 --> 07:11.763
It's been invaded.

07:11.932 --> 07:14.099
One of my roommates has this new
frat-boy boy toy.

07:14.268 --> 07:16.268
I can't escape him.
He's always there.

07:16.495 --> 07:19.012
Doesn't he have classes
of his own?

07:19.164 --> 07:20.830
I'm starting to doubt that.

07:20.924 --> 07:22.348
(sniffles)

07:22.443 --> 07:24.184
Oh...

07:24.336 --> 07:25.185
Oh.

07:25.279 --> 07:27.504
-Are you okay?
-(door opens, shuts)

07:27.597 --> 07:30.340
Your apartment is not
the only place

07:30.358 --> 07:32.175
-that's being invaded.
-Oh.

07:32.194 --> 07:34.268
-Hey, May.
-Hey.

07:34.288 --> 07:37.347
Oh, my God, you got a dog? When?

07:37.365 --> 07:39.182
Well, he's sort of a rescue.

07:39.201 --> 07:41.126
You always said
we couldn't get a dog.

07:41.353 --> 07:43.110
-What?
-Mom's allergies.

07:43.130 --> 07:44.370
-(sneezes)
-You said this was a cold.

07:44.539 --> 07:47.299
-Oh, you seemed so attached...
-Oh.

07:47.450 --> 07:49.859
I thought maybe
it wouldn't be that bed.

07:49.953 --> 07:50.952
He does seem really sweet, Mom.

07:50.971 --> 07:52.286
BOBBY:
Oh, he's a great dog.

07:52.455 --> 07:54.698
I don't suppose they
allow pets at your place?

07:54.716 --> 07:56.975
-(sneezes)
-Oh.

07:57.126 --> 07:59.552
-(dog yawns)
-BOBBY: Okay.

07:59.646 --> 08:02.063
I guess Hoover's gonna need
a new home.

08:10.157 --> 08:12.657
What's your address?

08:12.809 --> 08:14.159
<i> 719 Alexander Street.</i>

08:14.386 --> 08:16.736
Is there more than one suspect
in the house?

08:16.888 --> 08:17.979
<i> Definitely more than one.</i>

08:17.998 --> 08:19.556
Do they know you're
in the house?

08:19.649 --> 08:21.407
<i> I don't think so. I came home</i>
<i> to grab a few things.</i>

08:21.576 --> 08:24.077
<i> I came upstairs,</i>
<i> and I heard them talking.</i>

08:24.229 --> 08:25.245
Police are on their way.

08:25.397 --> 08:26.913
Are you in a safe location
right now?

08:27.007 --> 08:29.065
<i> No. I'm afraid to go</i>
<i> back downstairs.</i>

08:29.067 --> 08:31.067
<i> -They may see me.</i>
-Is there another room upstairs
where you can hide?

08:31.086 --> 08:34.662
<i> -Maybe the guest room.</i>
<i> -INTRUDER: Somebody's home!</i>
<i> Somebody's home!</i>

<i> Oh, God!</i>

08:46.693 --> 08:49.277
Sir?

08:51.089 --> 08:54.199
(siren approaching)

08:54.350 --> 08:56.034
<i> REPORTER (on TV):</i>
<i> We have breaking news.</i>

<i> (gunshots)</i>

09:11.810 --> 09:13.034
SUE:
He's alive.

09:13.053 --> 09:14.944
The paramedics dropped him off
at the ER,

09:15.038 --> 09:17.872
and he's on his way
into surgery now.

09:17.891 --> 09:20.308
When I heard those gunshots...

09:23.046 --> 09:25.880
The thing that makes us
good at our jobs

09:25.899 --> 09:27.732
is the ability to listen closely

09:27.959 --> 09:28.900
and then picture
what's happening

09:29.127 --> 09:30.569
on the other end of the line.

09:30.645 --> 09:33.646
Sometimes those pictures are
the stuff of nightmares.

09:34.816 --> 09:37.300
By any chance, did they catch
the guys that shot him?

09:37.302 --> 09:39.302
No. Suspects were long gone

09:39.321 --> 09:41.988
by the time the police
and paramedics arrived.

09:42.082 --> 09:44.082
A home invasion
in the middle of the day.

09:44.159 --> 09:47.160
Yeah, robberies have definitely
been on the rise.

09:47.254 --> 09:50.922
And suspects are just getting
a little more brazen.

09:52.092 --> 09:54.109
Let's hope they find them
before they strike again.

09:54.169 --> 09:56.303
(sirens approaching)

09:58.990 --> 10:01.507
-Rick.
-Thanks.

10:01.602 --> 10:02.767
What happened?

10:02.919 --> 10:04.085
Hey. I heard you responded

10:04.179 --> 10:05.937
to a home invasion call
here last night.

10:06.106 --> 10:07.606
I wanted you to
walk me through it.

10:07.833 --> 10:11.610
ATHENA:
Sharlo Darzi called in
thinking she had an intruder.

10:11.761 --> 10:14.170
Turned out just to be a raccoon.

10:14.189 --> 10:17.006
So, who's our new victim?

10:17.100 --> 10:19.175
Samir Darzi. The husband.

10:19.194 --> 10:20.601
I thought he was out of town.

10:20.695 --> 10:23.121
Flew back this morning when
he found out about his wife.

10:23.272 --> 10:26.440
He came home to pick
some things out for her,

10:26.534 --> 10:29.035
discovered a robbery
in progress, called 911.

10:29.129 --> 10:30.444
They shot him while he was
on the phone

10:30.464 --> 10:32.113
with the dispatcher.
Three shots.

10:32.132 --> 10:33.447
One in the shoulder,
two in the back.

10:33.541 --> 10:35.859
The raccoon definitely
didn't do this.

10:35.861 --> 10:39.787
Two home invasion calls
from the same address

10:39.865 --> 10:41.306
less than 12 hours apart.

10:41.533 --> 10:43.683
-What are the odds?
-Not ones I like.

10:51.300 --> 10:53.968
Plan for today.
I'll take Denny to school,

10:53.987 --> 10:55.302
but I have some meetings
this afternoon,

10:55.322 --> 10:57.547
so Clive will pick him up
after school

10:57.640 --> 10:58.990
and take him to practice.

10:59.142 --> 11:00.641
I like when you poach the eggs.

11:00.661 --> 11:02.235
Don't get pretentious.

11:02.387 --> 11:04.329
Tony is gonna stop by midday
to bring you some lunch,

11:04.480 --> 11:07.666
and I'll pick up Denny
and dinner after work.

11:07.893 --> 11:09.559
We should be home around 7:00.

11:09.728 --> 11:11.744
Oh. What do I do all day?

11:11.897 --> 11:12.987
Study.

11:13.064 --> 11:15.006
So you could ace
your practical exam

11:15.158 --> 11:17.008
with Doctor... What's-Her-Face.

11:17.160 --> 11:19.085
-Oh. Simmons.
-Exactly.

11:19.237 --> 11:20.845
See? We've got it all covered.

11:20.997 --> 11:22.405
All you have to do is study.

11:22.498 --> 11:24.331
-(knock at door)
-Ooh, and get the door.

11:24.351 --> 11:28.603
-Denny, help me clear
the table, please, now.
-Yeah.

11:33.101 --> 11:34.008
-Cap.
-Hey, Hen.

11:34.027 --> 11:36.677
I'm sorry to just show up.

11:36.697 --> 11:37.754
But I need a favor.

11:37.772 --> 11:39.105
Let me guess.

11:39.199 --> 11:40.865
Probably more than a favor.

11:41.017 --> 11:42.442
Hoover, the infamous rescue dog?

11:42.594 --> 11:45.036
To whom my wife is apparently
highly allergic.

11:45.113 --> 11:46.779
-Bobby...
-I know it's a lot to ask,

11:46.873 --> 11:48.689
but I figure you got
plenty of space,

11:48.783 --> 11:49.933
you got a nice, big backyard...

11:49.951 --> 11:51.768
And a wife who has
sworn off pets

11:51.786 --> 11:52.877
since Paisley died.

11:52.954 --> 11:54.629
Hoover is exceptional.

11:56.274 --> 11:59.592
Uh, d-don't look at me
like that.

12:01.463 --> 12:03.780
-You, either.
-Oh, my God, is that a dog?

12:03.915 --> 12:06.266
-Yes, it is.
-(Hoover barks)

12:07.786 --> 12:10.544
You are gonna owe me big-time.

12:10.564 --> 12:11.621
Here.

12:11.639 --> 12:13.314
-Take it.
-(toy squeaks)

12:14.067 --> 12:16.317
Yeah, he loves that thing.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.840
I changed all the locks
yesterday.

13:03.858 --> 13:06.100
Of course you did.

13:06.177 --> 13:09.270
Wait, where did you get a key?

13:09.289 --> 13:12.106
Oh, Mom thought you could use
some help around the house.

13:12.200 --> 13:14.684
Does no one remember
that you're not handy?

13:14.702 --> 13:15.868
You break one toilet...

13:16.021 --> 13:17.444

13:17.464 --> 13:19.464

It just so happens that,
well, I know a guy

13:27.623 --> 13:28.714
who insulates houses.

13:28.867 --> 13:30.199
He lent me his spray foam truck.

13:30.218 --> 13:32.552
-You borrowed a truck of foam?
-Good stuff.

13:32.704 --> 13:34.011
R-seven per inch.

13:34.164 --> 13:35.480
And how many inches?

13:35.707 --> 13:37.056
In California, it is recommended
that your attic should have

13:37.208 --> 13:39.150
an R Value between 30 and 60.

13:39.227 --> 13:40.968
-So I'm thinking five inches.
-(scoffs)

13:41.062 --> 13:42.987
You almost sound like
you know what you're doing.

13:43.139 --> 13:44.063
This stuff will save you
thousands

13:44.215 --> 13:45.639
in heating and cooling costs.

13:45.659 --> 13:47.474
And it'll block out
all the traffic noise outside.

13:47.569 --> 13:50.570

Well, we're not gonna get
up to the attic that way.

15:30.488 --> 15:31.837
Do you know if he has
his phone on?

15:31.932 --> 15:33.489
Have you tried calling him?

15:33.491 --> 15:34.915
I've been calling him
since before I called you.

15:34.935 --> 15:36.559
-He's not answering.
-(line ringing)

15:40.607 --> 15:42.941
I'm not hearing any ringing.

15:43.168 --> 15:44.667
Uh, he said he would
soundproof the house.

15:44.760 --> 15:48.020
Yeah, well, it looks like he
insulated it pretty good, too.

15:48.097 --> 15:49.430
I'm not getting any kind
of heat signature.

15:49.598 --> 15:51.616
How do we get him out
if we can't find him?

15:51.767 --> 15:52.842
Old-fashioned pick and poke.

15:52.935 --> 15:54.268
Everybody gear up
and spread out.

15:54.362 --> 15:56.937
Uh, hang on.
What are you poking?

16:01.294 --> 16:04.036

16:28.488 --> 16:31.047
Guys, I want you to start
poking inspection holes.

16:31.065 --> 16:34.217
I want to find the edges
of that plywood floor up there.

16:34.310 --> 16:35.809
Cap, should I grab
some supports?

16:35.829 --> 16:36.902
No, it wouldn't be enough.

16:36.997 --> 16:38.353
We need something stronger.

16:38.355 --> 16:40.723
Well, you know what?

16:40.816 --> 16:42.625

to stay outside.

17:35.871 --> 17:36.962
It's not safe in here.

17:37.057 --> 17:39.515
-On three. One, two, three.
-Yeah.

17:42.211 --> 17:45.271

One, two, three!

17:46.791 --> 17:49.025
Checking airway.

17:51.905 --> 17:53.220
Lungs are clear,
but breathing is shallow.

17:53.389 --> 17:56.115
All right, let's get him
out of here! Let's move!

17:59.395 --> 18:01.895
Sats at 92, starting him

-No response.

18:07.645 --> 18:08.920
Breathing is shallow.

18:09.071 --> 18:10.329
Vincent, I'm gonna give you
some rescue breaths here.

18:10.481 --> 18:11.905
Start breathing with this.
Come on, buddy.

18:12.074 --> 18:13.482
Why isn't he waking up?

18:13.484 --> 18:15.334
-Come on, Vincent!
-Come on, buddy.

18:15.428 --> 18:17.320

18:17.338 --> 18:18.579

18:18.598 --> 18:19.839
There it is. There it is.

-That's it, that's it!
-There you go.

-Vincent, thank God.
-(coughing)

18:23.161 --> 18:25.995
-What happened?
-You almost died.

18:26.088 --> 18:28.013
I can't believe
that you were up there.

18:28.108 --> 18:31.925
I just wanted to prove
I could do it. Help you.

18:32.003 --> 18:33.502
Like a big brother.

18:33.596 --> 18:37.690
You know what would be helpful?
To not almost die on me.

18:37.784 --> 18:39.525
Never do that again.

18:39.677 --> 18:43.079
Okay. Is the house okay?

18:43.865 --> 18:46.582
We'll talk about it later.

18:47.627 --> 18:50.002
(siren wailing)

19:04.793 --> 19:06.385
Hey there.

19:06.479 --> 19:08.888
You ready for your
big day tomorrow?

19:09.040 --> 19:12.358
I think so. You want to quiz me?

19:16.823 --> 19:18.731
-Oh.
-Mm-hmm.

19:18.883 --> 19:20.549
What happened to the only thing

19:20.568 --> 19:22.809
I should be focused on
is studying?

19:22.829 --> 19:24.829
Well, you've been studying
nonstop,

19:24.980 --> 19:27.481
and now it's time to let it go

19:27.500 --> 19:29.074
and trust that
you've done your best.

19:29.169 --> 19:32.170
And reward yourself
for all your hard work.

19:32.397 --> 19:35.381
What kind of reward
did you have in mind?

19:36.567 --> 19:39.093
(both laugh)

19:42.515 --> 19:44.573
-I can't.
-What?

19:44.667 --> 19:47.059
Not with him watching.

19:47.687 --> 19:49.428
(whining)

19:49.580 --> 19:51.914
Are you serious?

19:51.933 --> 19:54.192
It's making me uncomfortable.

19:54.343 --> 19:55.434
(sighs)

19:55.528 --> 19:56.919
Okay. Okay.

19:56.938 --> 19:59.104
I'll just let him out.

20:00.091 --> 20:03.759
Come here, boy.
Yeah, that's a good boy.

20:03.778 --> 20:05.661
Mm-hmm.

20:08.023 --> 20:10.374
Okay, there you go.

20:10.601 --> 20:12.460
Enjoy yourself.

20:15.381 --> 20:17.215
Now...

20:17.442 --> 20:18.532
(chuckles)

20:18.626 --> 20:21.135
...where were we?

20:24.632 --> 20:25.965
(Hoover whining)

20:26.059 --> 20:28.559
Oh, now he sounds sad.

20:28.711 --> 20:31.979
Maybe he'll go down the hall
to Denny's room.

20:32.732 --> 20:36.125
(scratching at door)

20:36.218 --> 20:38.978
-(sighs)
-(Hoover whining)

20:39.130 --> 20:42.073
Fine. Fine.

20:42.891 --> 20:44.283
Fine, fine.

20:44.986 --> 20:46.410
Fine. It's just fine.

20:47.747 --> 20:49.305
Okay, you can come in, just...

20:49.398 --> 20:51.749
Hey, Hoover, no, that's...

20:55.146 --> 20:59.131
You are such a mood killer.

21:02.595 --> 21:03.910
(knock on door)

21:03.930 --> 21:07.431
Hey, you apprehend
our armed robbers yet?

21:07.658 --> 21:11.660
No. But I think
our home invasion is not

21:11.679 --> 21:13.604
an isolated case.

21:13.831 --> 21:15.831
I found ten other burglaries

21:15.850 --> 21:17.775
in the last month
with a similar M.O.

21:18.002 --> 21:20.169
Pricey neighborhoods hit at
all different times of the day,

21:20.262 --> 21:22.446
but in each case,
the residents were never home.

21:22.598 --> 21:25.858
Until Samir Darzi
came home and got shot.

21:26.010 --> 21:28.677
-Mm.
-That house have
security cameras?

21:28.679 --> 21:30.346
Oh, yeah.

21:30.364 --> 21:33.182
Two guys, average height,
average build,

21:33.200 --> 21:35.034
wearing ski masks
and generic track suits.

21:35.186 --> 21:36.443
They walk up with
rolling duffel bags,

21:36.537 --> 21:38.779
they go inside,
and they roll back out

21:38.873 --> 21:40.131
with all the jewelry
and luxury items

21:40.358 --> 21:41.707
they can fit in the bags.

21:41.859 --> 21:42.949
In and out in less than 20.

21:43.044 --> 21:44.376
And they didn't set off
any alarms

21:44.529 --> 21:47.046
or break a single door
or window.

21:47.140 --> 21:49.548
Yeah, I mean, they must have
cased the place in advance,

21:49.642 --> 21:53.052
but what I can't figure out is
how they pick their targets.

21:53.146 --> 21:54.628
The victims don't have
anything in common,

21:54.722 --> 21:56.388
except for being rich.

21:56.541 --> 21:58.707
ATHENA:
And the fact that they were
guaranteed never to be home.

21:58.726 --> 22:00.735
-Wait. How?
-Here.

22:03.064 --> 22:04.547
"A homeowner interview
was conducted

22:04.565 --> 22:07.474
"at El Dorado Union Hospital
as Mr. Drake was recovering

22:07.493 --> 22:10.477
from heart surgery following
a coronary incident."

22:10.496 --> 22:12.237
Okay, so this victim had
a heart attack.

22:12.332 --> 22:14.665
His house was broken into
that night.

22:14.817 --> 22:16.075
This one.

22:16.318 --> 22:20.412
It says that the homeowner
was injured in a kitchen fire.

22:20.506 --> 22:22.656
She was still also
in the hospital

22:22.675 --> 22:24.675
when her house was hit.

22:24.827 --> 22:27.345
And there's another one.

22:27.496 --> 22:30.014
"Victim is still recovering
from a fractured shoulder

22:30.165 --> 22:33.242
after an unrelated slip
and fall in the shower."

22:33.260 --> 22:35.836
Maybe not that unrelated.

22:35.855 --> 22:39.673
Okay, so you have an accident
or a medical emergency,

22:39.692 --> 22:41.100
you're in the hospital.

22:41.194 --> 22:43.435
It's a great time for someone
to come and rob you blind.

22:43.529 --> 22:45.345
It still doesn't explain
how they were able to

22:45.365 --> 22:46.847
get in and out the way they did.

22:46.941 --> 22:50.034
I mean, they wouldn't have had
time to case the place.

22:50.261 --> 22:53.329
Unless someone had already
done it for them.

22:55.282 --> 22:57.691
Think about it. You're at home.

22:57.785 --> 22:59.377
You start having chest pains,

22:59.604 --> 23:02.863
or you set your kitchen on fire.
What do you do?

23:02.924 --> 23:04.882
You call for help.

23:05.033 --> 23:08.794
And "help" is gonna ask
a lot of questions.

23:08.871 --> 23:12.056
Paramedics can reset the alarm,
ma'am. What is the alarm code?

23:12.133 --> 23:13.949
Sir, the fire department is
on the way.

23:13.951 --> 23:15.226
You said you live alone?

23:15.486 --> 23:17.895
Are there any dogs
at your residence?

23:18.122 --> 23:20.547
That's what all the victims
had in common.

23:20.641 --> 23:23.216
They all dialed 911.

23:23.310 --> 23:24.960
(elevator bell chimes)

23:25.053 --> 23:27.796
So every robbery victim
called 911?

23:27.815 --> 23:30.149
Seems like the thieves used
the hospital visits

23:30.301 --> 23:31.800
as an open invitation.

23:31.894 --> 23:34.245
We need to look at everyone
who was aware of the emergencies

23:34.472 --> 23:37.063
at these addresses,
see if there's any overlap.

23:37.158 --> 23:40.251
And you think a first responder
might be involved in this?

23:40.402 --> 23:41.735
Afraid so.

23:41.829 --> 23:43.812
All right, let me
check the list.

23:43.831 --> 23:47.666
Um, Linda took this call.
Linda Bates.

23:47.760 --> 23:49.427
The 133 responded.

23:49.654 --> 23:52.078
This one dispatcher
was Josh Russo.

23:52.131 --> 23:53.989
He sent the 142 to that scene.

23:54.008 --> 23:58.010
Josh also took the raccoon call,
but that time, he sent the 118.

23:58.104 --> 24:00.846
This one in Brentwood,
dispatcher was Rashida Marvel.

24:00.998 --> 24:02.347
Firehouse was the 126.

24:02.442 --> 24:05.334
Marlene took this other call,
Jamal dispatched that one.

24:05.352 --> 24:07.169
Henry, Moira. This is me.

24:07.262 --> 24:08.612
I don't see anything
in common here.

24:08.839 --> 24:11.507
Yeah, other than residents
from affluent zip codes.

24:11.600 --> 24:12.675
It was worth a shot.

24:12.693 --> 24:14.618
Yep. Well, thank you, Maddie.

24:14.845 --> 24:16.011
Oh, wait.

24:16.030 --> 24:17.362
-What? You found something?
-Yeah.

24:17.515 --> 24:19.105
Every time someone pulls up
a call record,

24:19.125 --> 24:22.108
the system makes a note of it--
who did it and when.

24:22.128 --> 24:23.961
All of these calls were
accessed multiple times

24:24.112 --> 24:25.129
by the same person.

24:25.280 --> 24:28.382
Great. So who's our
common denominator?

24:30.285 --> 24:31.719
Uh...

24:34.381 --> 24:35.764
Me.

24:44.875 --> 24:48.393
Whoa, Magda,
what is going on here?

24:48.546 --> 24:51.563
Cleaning. I want everything
to be pristine.

24:51.640 --> 24:54.883
-It's getting there.
-Oh, don't worry,
I have a system.

24:54.977 --> 24:58.162
I'll put everything back
in its place before... (gasps)

24:58.313 --> 24:59.830
You're wearing shoes.

24:59.982 --> 25:03.242
Yeah, I sometimes do that,
for the walking.

25:03.394 --> 25:06.987
Did you know that shoes are
66,000 times

25:07.006 --> 25:08.672
-dirtier than toilets?
-I do now.

25:08.899 --> 25:10.007
Uh, I'll take 'em off.

25:10.234 --> 25:12.401
-Just let me put this
somewhere...
-Mm...

25:12.419 --> 25:14.737
All... right.

25:14.755 --> 25:17.097
(Magda chuckles)

25:17.833 --> 25:19.666
(Magda sighs)

25:19.744 --> 25:22.002
So, uh, where's Maddie
and Jee-Yun?

25:22.021 --> 25:24.337
Oh, Maddie put Jee-Yun
to bed an hour ago.

25:24.506 --> 25:27.432
Then she went in the bathroom.
She's been in there a while.

25:27.585 --> 25:29.434
Probably plotting her escape.

25:29.587 --> 25:30.435
What?

25:30.530 --> 25:33.013
I should go make sure
she's okay.

25:33.032 --> 25:35.991
All right.

25:38.946 --> 25:40.779
-MADDIE: Who is it?
-It's me.

25:40.931 --> 25:43.582
-Please let me in.
-Come in.

25:45.119 --> 25:46.502
Quick, close the door.

25:48.439 --> 25:49.938
What is going on out there?

25:49.957 --> 25:51.623
And what are you doing
in the bathtub?

25:51.776 --> 25:53.275
I needed a place to hide.

25:53.294 --> 25:56.295
Jee's asleep, and Magda launched
a full-on cleaning offensive.

25:56.389 --> 25:59.448
Yeah, I had to cross enemy lines
just to get in here.

25:59.466 --> 26:01.875
I mean, I told her not to,
but she insisted.

26:01.894 --> 26:03.185
(grunts)

26:05.714 --> 26:07.806
Thank you.

26:07.900 --> 26:12.494
Look at us. We're literally
tiptoeing around our own house.

26:12.496 --> 26:15.406
-How was your day otherwise?
-Oh, great.

26:15.633 --> 26:18.133
I am a suspect in a string
of burglaries.

26:18.152 --> 26:20.152
The police think someone
at the call center

26:20.228 --> 26:24.081
is using our log-in information
to pick out potential victims.

26:24.232 --> 26:25.749
Okay, but not you.

26:25.901 --> 26:28.160
But whoever it is used my I.D.
to access the files.

26:28.312 --> 26:30.329
Athena said it won't
take long to clear me

26:30.497 --> 26:32.164
because I wasn't even
at the call center

26:32.316 --> 26:33.573
when half the log-ins happened.

26:33.667 --> 26:34.817
Wow.

26:35.595 --> 26:37.077
You think someone
stole your password?

26:37.096 --> 26:38.578
I guess so.

26:38.672 --> 26:40.964
But I don't know how.

26:41.191 --> 26:42.841
It's weird. It's not like
you're logging in

26:42.993 --> 26:44.176
from a coffee shop or something.

26:44.328 --> 26:47.980
No, but someone took
my password anyway.

26:53.261 --> 26:55.170
(indistinct chatter)

26:55.263 --> 26:58.532
(elevator bell chimes)

27:00.010 --> 27:01.844
-Hi.
-Hey. Anything you want
to tell me?

27:01.937 --> 27:05.164
(indistinct conversation)

27:17.044 --> 27:20.387
Hey. I thought
you were off today.

27:25.961 --> 27:27.961
-Maddie, are you all right?
-I don't know.

27:28.130 --> 27:30.555
They called me in.
Sue wants to see me.

27:30.708 --> 27:31.874
Why?

27:31.967 --> 27:33.633
I think I'm getting fired.

27:33.653 --> 27:35.135
Fired? What?

27:35.154 --> 27:36.545
Yeah, you know about
the burglaries.

27:36.563 --> 27:38.638
Right? All the victims
called 911,

27:38.732 --> 27:40.382
and they think that
I'm the connection.

27:40.475 --> 27:42.234
But they didn't call you,
did they?

27:42.386 --> 27:46.312
No, but my log-in was used
to access those recordings,

27:46.332 --> 27:47.814
and nobody else had
that information.

27:47.833 --> 27:49.741
Maddie, they can't fire you.

27:49.894 --> 27:51.560
You didn't do anything wrong.

27:51.729 --> 27:52.744
Doesn't matter.

27:52.897 --> 27:54.487
My name is on all
the call records.

27:54.507 --> 27:56.489
-But if that's all they have...
-It's enough.

27:56.583 --> 27:58.491
Even if they can't prove
that I helped the thieves,

27:58.585 --> 28:01.069
because I didn't,
I can't prove that

28:01.163 --> 28:03.163
I wasn't negligent
with my password.

28:03.331 --> 28:06.666
They can't arrest me,
but I can lose my job anyway.

28:06.686 --> 28:08.427
No. That's not fair.

28:08.579 --> 28:10.245
Honestly, I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

28:10.338 --> 28:12.398
I mean, I love this place.

28:13.267 --> 28:15.584
Helping people, saving lives.

28:15.602 --> 28:16.694
You know what I mean?

28:16.845 --> 28:18.344
That feeling you get
when you know

28:18.364 --> 28:20.656
that you're doing
the right thing?

28:21.534 --> 28:23.033
Yeah.

28:23.185 --> 28:24.350
It's all gonna go away

28:24.445 --> 28:27.329
because of some stupid
lost password.

28:30.525 --> 28:33.085
You didn't lose your password,
Maddie.

28:34.438 --> 28:36.130
I took it.

28:37.624 --> 28:40.384
That day I asked you
about the active logs,

28:40.535 --> 28:41.944
you showed me how
to access them.

28:41.962 --> 28:44.054
Put in your I.D. number, and...

28:44.223 --> 28:46.223
<i> NOAH:</i>
<i> I watched you log in.</i>

28:46.374 --> 28:48.283
I almost forgot about that.

28:48.302 --> 28:51.303
I used the calls to find out
when a house would be empty,

28:51.397 --> 28:53.564
and I passed along
the information.

28:53.733 --> 28:56.975
I promise you, Maddie,
no one was supposed to get hurt.

28:57.069 --> 28:58.794
The houses were
supposed to be empty.

28:58.887 --> 29:00.128
I-I was always careful.

29:00.147 --> 29:03.056
You weren't careful.
You were lucky.

29:03.075 --> 29:05.300
A man got shot.
He could've died.

29:05.393 --> 29:07.060
I know.

29:07.079 --> 29:09.413
And I'm really sorry.

29:09.564 --> 29:11.415
I just didn't know
what else to do.

29:11.642 --> 29:13.066
Why would you do this?

29:13.160 --> 29:15.994
My stepdad-- he got into
some money trouble.

29:16.830 --> 29:18.497
He didn't want
my mom and I to know,

29:18.591 --> 29:22.501
so he borrowed
from the wrong people.

29:22.653 --> 29:26.054
When he couldn't repay them,
they hurt him.

29:27.916 --> 29:30.601
He said they were gonna
hurt my mom, too.

29:31.662 --> 29:32.969
They knew I worked here.

29:33.196 --> 29:35.606
So you were trying
to repay his debt.

29:35.833 --> 29:37.833
I didn't know what else to do.

29:37.851 --> 29:39.351
I was too scared to tell anyone.

29:39.503 --> 29:42.095
(sighs)
I wish you would've told me.

29:42.114 --> 29:43.763
We could've helped you.

29:43.783 --> 29:46.024
Can you help me now?

29:46.101 --> 29:47.600
Please, Maddie.

29:47.694 --> 29:49.361
I'm sorry.

29:49.455 --> 29:51.288

To me.

30:04.786 --> 30:06.194
What do I do?

30:06.363 --> 30:07.304
Tell them everything.

30:07.531 --> 30:08.639
If they can find these guys...

30:08.866 --> 30:10.290
I know where they are.

30:10.309 --> 30:11.308
What do you mean?

30:11.535 --> 30:13.368
I told them about
your investigation.

30:13.387 --> 30:14.978
I thought that would
make them stop.

30:15.130 --> 30:16.129
They wanted one more job.

30:16.223 --> 30:19.024
You gave them
another house to hit?

30:20.561 --> 30:23.070
