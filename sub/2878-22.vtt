WEBVTT

00:11.342 --> 00:14.560
I wish you could all
be inside my head.

00:15.412 --> 00:17.797
The conversation is sparkling.

00:19.483 --> 00:20.900
Fine, I'll tell you.

00:22.086 --> 00:24.504
A lichen is an organism made
up of two separate species,

00:24.506 --> 00:26.122
fungi and algae.

00:26.124 --> 00:27.707
If you could merge
with another species,

00:27.709 --> 00:30.877
what species would
you pick and why?

00:30.879 --> 00:33.463
Hint: There is a right answer.

00:34.832 --> 00:36.415
None of you will get it.

00:37.851 --> 00:41.637
Okay, I'd pick swan because, uh,
the resulting hybrid

00:41.639 --> 00:43.806
would have the advanced
industrial civilization

00:43.808 --> 00:46.275
of a human and
the long graceful neck

00:46.277 --> 00:48.427
I've always dreamed of having.

00:49.680 --> 00:52.365
Wrong. Leonard?

00:52.367 --> 00:56.235
Horse, but mostly just
for the height.

00:56.237 --> 00:59.155
A little bit for
the genital girth.

01:00.324 --> 01:02.441
Wrong, and let's
keep it clean, shall we?

01:03.911 --> 01:05.078
Kangaroo, uh,

01:05.080 --> 01:07.080
I'd be Kanga-Jew.

01:08.466 --> 01:11.667
The first of my people
to dunk a basketball.

01:11.669 --> 01:13.970
Also instead of just living
in your mother's house,

01:13.972 --> 01:16.839
you could actually
live inside her body.

01:20.127 --> 01:22.178
Clever, but also wrong.

01:22.180 --> 01:24.797
No, the best organism for human
beings to merge with

01:24.799 --> 01:26.349
is the lichen itself.

01:26.351 --> 01:29.736
That way, you'd be human,
fungus, and algae.

01:29.738 --> 01:31.303
Triple threat.

01:31.305 --> 01:34.306
Like three-bean salad.

01:34.308 --> 01:36.893
Give me one circumstance in
which that would be useful.

01:36.895 --> 01:37.827
All right, picture this:

01:37.829 --> 01:40.312
a beautiful outdoor concert.

01:40.314 --> 01:42.815
Now, as a human,
I appreciate Beethoven.

01:42.817 --> 01:45.535
As a fungus,
I have a terrific view,

01:45.537 --> 01:47.486
growing out of a
towering maple tree.

01:47.488 --> 01:49.705
And no thank you,
expensive concessions.

01:49.707 --> 01:53.426
Because as an algae, I'll just
snack on this sunlight.

01:54.278 --> 01:56.863
- He got us again.
- No, he didn't.

01:56.865 --> 01:59.098
Anyway, if it's
okay with you,

01:59.100 --> 02:01.801
we should talk about
Howard's bachelor party.

02:01.803 --> 02:02.802
Oh, oh.

02:02.804 --> 02:04.670
Seems like a bit
of a letdown

02:04.672 --> 02:06.172
after our lichen
conversation, but...

02:06.174 --> 02:08.441
What do you know,
you're half swan.

02:09.675 --> 02:11.360
I've been doing
some research on strippers.

02:11.362 --> 02:14.030
One agency I spoke to, said I
could get us a great price

02:14.032 --> 02:17.784
if we're flexible on
age range and number of limbs.

02:18.819 --> 02:20.519
Sounds like loads of fun,

02:20.521 --> 02:23.573
but I promised Bernadette
no strippers.

02:23.575 --> 02:25.708
You don't want strippers?
You're the king of strippers.

02:25.710 --> 02:29.162
The one club in North Hollywood
named a pole after you.

02:29.164 --> 02:32.582
What can I tell ya-- I'm not
into that stuff anymore.

02:32.584 --> 02:34.300
Good for you, Howard.
I'm proud of you.

02:34.302 --> 02:36.586
And still, you're the first one
of use to get married.

02:36.588 --> 02:38.087
We have to do something special.

02:38.089 --> 02:40.923
You know Germans have an
interesting pre-wedding custom--

02:40.925 --> 02:44.010
Well, it's probably not for me.

02:46.430 --> 02:48.714
Maybe we can go up to
Napa Valley.

02:48.716 --> 02:50.082
They've got that wine train.

02:50.084 --> 02:51.517
Boo, wine!

02:51.519 --> 02:53.903
But yay, trains. I'm in.

02:53.905 --> 02:56.856
Anyway, it's a beautiful
time of year.

02:56.858 --> 02:58.908
Uh, you travel through
the vineyards.

02:58.910 --> 03:00.109
There's a tasting on board.

03:00.111 --> 03:02.745
And all the wildflowers
are in bloom.

03:02.747 --> 03:04.831
Magic.

03:04.833 --> 03:06.415
Look at that, in 30 seconds,

03:06.417 --> 03:09.802
we went from
hiring women to being them.

== sync, corrected by <font color=#00FF00>elderman</font> ==

03:40.273 --> 03:42.266
So, I hear you and
the lost boys are having

03:42.267 --> 03:44.551
a bachelor party tonight.

03:44.553 --> 03:47.053
Yeah, just going to a
restaurant, get some steaks,

03:47.055 --> 03:49.839
and scotch. Nothing to worry about.
Why should I worry?

03:49.841 --> 03:51.507
Well, I don't know.
It's a bachelor party.

03:51.509 --> 03:52.609
There could be strippers.

03:52.611 --> 03:54.060
Wouldn't that make you
a little jealous?

03:54.062 --> 03:57.030
Oh, come on Leonard, it's you.
What's going to happen?

03:57.032 --> 03:59.015
I mean, even if
there was a stripper,

03:59.017 --> 04:00.483
all you'd do is avoid
eye-contact

04:00.485 --> 04:04.154
and maybe offer to help
her kid with his homework.

04:04.156 --> 04:06.823
Hey, I am a young man
in his sexual prime.

04:06.825 --> 04:09.826
Under the right conditions,
I-I-I am capable of just,

04:09.828 --> 04:12.862
really crazy stuff.

04:12.864 --> 04:14.581
Really? What is
the craziest thing

04:14.583 --> 04:15.965
you've ever done with a woman?

04:15.967 --> 04:18.834
And the time you and I had sex
in the ocean does not count.

04:18.837 --> 04:21.303
Oh, come on.
That's got to count.

04:21.305 --> 04:25.158
There was a really strong
undertow, we could have died.

04:25.160 --> 04:26.926
Well, have fun tonight.

04:26.928 --> 04:28.311
Oh, I will.

04:28.313 --> 04:31.231
There is no telling
what might happen.

04:32.566 --> 04:33.983
Yeah, there is.

04:35.236 --> 04:37.187
You know, there's
nothing wrong helping

04:37.189 --> 04:39.689
some woman's kid
get through their S.A.T.'s.

04:43.577 --> 04:45.328
Hey, I got to hand it to Raj,

04:45.330 --> 04:47.580
He found a really nice spot
to have a bachelor party.

04:47.582 --> 04:49.165
It's not bad.

04:49.167 --> 04:52.502
Unless you compare it to
a train; then it stinks.

04:54.138 --> 04:55.338
Are you drinking whiskey?

04:55.340 --> 04:56.740
Indeed.

04:56.742 --> 04:59.742
If I'm to participate
in the social convention

04:59.744 --> 05:03.630
that is the stag night, then I
must embrace all its components:

05:03.632 --> 05:08.718
including tobacco,
swear words, and yes, alcohol.

05:09.837 --> 05:13.723
Jeepers! That's yucky.

05:13.725 --> 05:16.226
Whoa, it's a little
early to start

05:16.228 --> 05:19.012
dropping J-bombs,
don't you think?

05:19.014 --> 05:20.647
Hey, you guys.

05:20.649 --> 05:23.366
Oh, hey, Wil. Nice of you to
make it out tonight for Howard.

05:23.368 --> 05:25.068
Well, it was either
this or another

05:25.070 --> 05:27.404
hot tub party at
George Takei's house.

05:27.406 --> 05:29.105
I'm confused.

05:29.107 --> 05:30.940
I thought since our
reconciliation,

05:30.942 --> 05:32.442
I was your friend
in this group.

05:32.444 --> 05:34.097
Oh, I'm friends
with Howard too.

05:34.122 --> 05:34.795
Oh!

05:34.796 --> 05:37.330
I guess you're just
friends with anybody.

05:39.917 --> 05:41.784
Aah!

05:41.786 --> 05:44.220
Hey, uh, Leonard...

05:44.222 --> 05:47.390
things are a little tight
at the comic book store.

05:47.392 --> 05:50.460
I might need some help covering
my share of the check.

05:50.462 --> 05:52.145
Oh, yeah, no worries.

05:52.147 --> 05:53.930
And maybe a few bucks
for the valet.

05:53.932 --> 05:55.014
Oh, all right.

05:55.016 --> 05:57.016
And gas money to get home.

05:57.018 --> 05:59.302
Yeah, sure.
Great.

05:59.304 --> 06:02.203
You know what? This is
my grandfather's watch.

06:02.228 --> 06:02.639
Oh.

06:02.640 --> 06:04.974
18-carat gold, got it
in Europe during the war.

06:04.976 --> 06:06.642
Wow, that's very nice.
Mm-hmm.

06:06.644 --> 06:08.828
100 bucks and it's yours.

06:08.830 --> 06:10.780
Hey, everybody!

06:10.782 --> 06:12.499
The bachelor boy has arrived!

06:12.501 --> 06:16.336
♪ For he's
a jolly good fellow ♪

06:16.338 --> 06:18.488
♪ For he's a
jolly good fellow ♪

06:18.490 --> 06:22.175
♪ For he's a jolly
good fellow ♪

06:22.177 --> 06:23.843
♪ Which nobody can deny ♪

06:23.845 --> 06:26.179
Yes, yes, yes.
He's a jolly good fellow.

06:26.181 --> 06:28.681
What time do
the strippers arrive?

06:28.683 --> 06:32.268
Actually, Barry, we're not going
to have strippers tonight.

06:32.270 --> 06:35.972
Ah, then what the frig did I get
200 dollars in singles out for?

06:37.725 --> 06:39.893
You want to buy a watch?

06:42.846 --> 06:45.548
This is Maid of Honor
Amy Farrah Fowler,

06:45.550 --> 06:47.150
bringing you the
wedding activities

06:47.152 --> 06:49.369
just weeks out from
the big day.

06:49.371 --> 06:52.789
Let's check in with a beautiful,
radiant young woman,

06:52.791 --> 06:56.075
and her friend who's
about to get married.

06:57.495 --> 06:59.796
Ladies, can you tell us
what you're doing?

06:59.798 --> 07:01.297
Um, these are gift bags

07:01.299 --> 07:03.866
we're going to put in the hotel
rooms of our out-of-town guests.

07:03.868 --> 07:05.568
This is a map of Pasadena.

07:05.570 --> 07:07.504
This is a list of
local restaurants.

07:07.506 --> 07:08.871
And then, for
Howie's relatives,

07:08.873 --> 07:10.673
we have antihistamines,
antacids,

07:10.675 --> 07:13.709
and medicine for diarrhea
and constipation.

07:13.711 --> 07:16.429
Yeah, we labeled them
"stop and go."

07:18.849 --> 07:20.967
All right, pivoting
to the big question:

07:20.969 --> 07:22.718
Bernadette,
on your wedding night

07:22.720 --> 07:24.370
you'll be consummating
your marriage.

07:24.372 --> 07:26.489
What do you think your first
sexual position will be

07:26.491 --> 07:29.409
as husband and wife?

07:29.411 --> 07:31.227
Amy, please.

07:31.229 --> 07:32.862
Keeping in mind that
whoever's on top

07:32.864 --> 07:35.498
may set the tone
for the marriage.

07:35.500 --> 07:37.900
Okay, show's over.

07:37.902 --> 07:40.537
Hey, they may conceive a child
on their wedding night.

07:40.539 --> 07:41.955
Don't you think
the kid might get a kick

07:41.957 --> 07:43.523
out of knowing
how it happened?

07:44.408 --> 07:45.758
I don't care.

07:45.760 --> 07:48.077
Ask her things like "Are you
going to take Howard's name?"

07:48.079 --> 07:50.346
Not "Who's going
to sit on who."

07:51.715 --> 07:53.967
I've actually been thinking
I'm going to hyphenate:

07:53.969 --> 07:57.804
Bernadette Maryann
Rostenkowski-Wolowitz.

07:57.806 --> 07:58.938
Nice.

07:58.940 --> 08:00.189
You know, you should totally get

08:00.191 --> 08:02.475
Bernadette Maryann
Rostenkowski-Wolowitz.com

08:02.477 --> 08:05.928
before someone snaps it up.

08:05.930 --> 08:07.647
Howard already
took care of it.

08:09.149 --> 08:11.484
Plus, he set up our
beautiful wedding Web site

08:11.486 --> 08:13.870
with cute little facts
about our family histories.

08:13.872 --> 08:15.572
Do you know,
for a while in Poland,

08:15.574 --> 08:18.074
my family and his family
were neighbors.

08:18.076 --> 08:19.292
Oh, that's cool.

08:19.294 --> 08:22.378
No, it's not.
I'll explain it to you later.

08:27.085 --> 08:29.552
May I have
your attention, please?

08:29.554 --> 08:33.056
We are hear tonight to celebrate
the upcoming nuptials

08:33.058 --> 08:35.625
of my best friend
Howard Wolowitz.

08:35.626 --> 08:37.626
Hear! Hear!

08:37.629 --> 08:40.346
And, apparently,
Wil Wheaton's best friend.

08:40.347 --> 08:42.398
Sheldon...

08:42.400 --> 08:44.350
Talk to the hand.

08:45.569 --> 08:46.986
Does anyone
have any words

08:46.988 --> 08:50.523
they'd like to say about
our man of the evening?

08:50.525 --> 08:51.524
I do.

08:53.094 --> 08:54.494
As is the tradition,

08:54.496 --> 08:57.664
I have prepared a series of
disrespectful jokes

08:57.666 --> 09:00.416
which generate humor
at Howard's expense.

09:00.418 --> 09:02.318
Prepare to have your ribs
tickled...

09:02.320 --> 09:06.873
Howard... I always thought
you'd be the last one of us

09:06.875 --> 09:10.493
to ever get married, because you
are so short and unappealing.

09:10.495 --> 09:11.694
Am I right?

09:12.646 --> 09:14.163
Let's see here.

09:14.165 --> 09:15.665
Oh, seriously though, Howard,

09:15.667 --> 09:19.435
you're actually one of the most
intelligent people I know.

09:19.437 --> 09:21.387
And that's a zinger,
because you're not.

09:23.675 --> 09:26.192
I've always thought
that you'd make

09:26.194 --> 09:28.177
someone a fine husband someday.

09:28.179 --> 09:29.862
Assuming you'd be able
to get the parts,

09:29.864 --> 09:31.564
and develop the
engineering skills

09:31.566 --> 09:33.650
to assemble them,
which I don't see as likely.

09:33.652 --> 09:34.751
Hacha!

09:37.038 --> 09:38.655
Okay... Let me see here.

09:38.657 --> 09:40.223
Okay, kidding aside--

09:40.225 --> 09:42.625
Howard, you are a good friend.

09:42.627 --> 09:45.161
And I wish you nothing
but happiness.

09:45.163 --> 09:46.496
Bazinga, I don't!

09:47.598 --> 09:49.716
Sheldon...
Doubleazinga! I do!

09:50.751 --> 09:53.703
Good luck
following that.

09:56.140 --> 09:58.508
So, Howard Wolowitz
tying the knot.

09:58.510 --> 10:01.561
Leaving his crazy
bachelor days behind.

10:01.563 --> 10:03.730
He was a wild one.

10:03.732 --> 10:06.933
Well, I guess
we all kind of were.

10:07.768 --> 10:09.885
I remember this one time,

10:09.887 --> 10:13.222
I was with this girl
at the beach.

10:13.224 --> 10:17.410
We were in the ocean and
we started making out.

10:18.529 --> 10:21.280
I know, it was crazy.

10:22.249 --> 10:24.200
I wasn't even wearing
my Aquasocks.

10:25.703 --> 10:26.753
Then...

10:26.755 --> 10:27.737
Nobody cares, Hofstadter.

10:27.739 --> 10:28.871
Wrap it up.

10:28.873 --> 10:30.089
Right.

10:30.091 --> 10:31.040
To Howard.

10:31.042 --> 10:32.575
To Howard.

10:32.577 --> 10:34.544
I totally had sex
in the ocean.

10:37.014 --> 10:41.017
Okay, I'll go.

10:41.019 --> 10:46.305
Howard, when I think about you
and Bernadette

10:46.307 --> 10:49.258
starting this wonderful life
together,

10:49.260 --> 10:52.278
I can't help but
get a little choked up.

10:52.280 --> 10:53.479
I mean...

10:53.481 --> 10:54.480
look at you.

10:54.482 --> 10:57.233
You have everything.

10:57.235 --> 10:58.534
Look at me.

10:58.536 --> 11:00.603
I'm 37.

11:00.605 --> 11:02.955
I sleep in the back of
a comic book store,

11:02.957 --> 11:06.726
and I have the bone density
of an 80-year-old man.

11:08.779 --> 11:11.247
To Howard.

11:11.249 --> 11:14.617
Yeah, to Howard.
Yes...

11:14.619 --> 11:17.220
- Um, uh, who's next?
- I'll go.

11:17.222 --> 11:22.141
Howard, I'm gonna say something
to you that everybody's thinking

11:22.143 --> 11:25.428
but no one has the courage
to say out loud.

11:25.430 --> 11:27.480
When you invite a man
to a bachelor party,

11:27.482 --> 11:30.233
the implication is,
there will be strippers.

11:30.235 --> 11:32.769
Maybe not completely nude,

11:32.771 --> 11:34.403
but at least pasties
and G-strings.

11:34.405 --> 11:36.489
That's not unreasonable.

11:36.491 --> 11:38.941
- Hear, hear.
- Hear, hear.

11:38.943 --> 11:41.494
Okay, uh, anybody else?

11:41.496 --> 11:43.145
Huh? No?

11:43.147 --> 11:47.583
Okay, it all comes down
to me, the best man.

11:49.821 --> 11:53.489
Ooh! This grasshopper is
kicking my ass-hopper.

11:53.491 --> 11:56.992
Okay, okay, when I first
came to this country,

11:56.994 --> 12:00.496
I-I didn't know how to
behave or how to dress,

12:00.498 --> 12:03.382
or what was cool...
I was pretty lonely.

12:03.384 --> 12:07.169
But then I met Howard, and
suddenly, my life changed,

12:07.171 --> 12:11.057
because we could
be lonely together.

12:14.344 --> 12:18.147
This man became
my whole world.

12:18.149 --> 12:20.700
Yeah, nice speech, Francine.

12:24.354 --> 12:27.740
I'm not done,
but thank you.

12:27.742 --> 12:30.025
I think back....

12:32.462 --> 12:34.881
...to all the good times
we had, like, uh,

12:34.883 --> 12:37.032
when we went camping
and spent that night

12:37.034 --> 12:38.751
telling each other
all our secrets.

12:38.753 --> 12:41.704
I told him I'm addicted
to pedicures

12:41.706 --> 12:44.924
and he told me he lost his
virginity to his cousin.

12:48.062 --> 12:50.980
She was my second cousin.

12:50.982 --> 12:52.732
And the first woman you ever
disappointed sexually.

12:52.734 --> 12:55.101
Ba-da-bazinga!

12:55.103 --> 12:57.887
Oh... oh, yeah, and then
there was the time

12:57.889 --> 13:01.157
when Leonard and I took
Howard to Las Vegas

13:01.159 --> 13:04.994
and paid a hooker to
pretend she was Jewish

13:04.996 --> 13:08.998
and that she wanted
his little kosher pickle.

13:10.902 --> 13:13.035
Of all the "Howard
humping hookers" stories,

13:13.037 --> 13:15.204
that one's my favorite!

13:15.206 --> 13:17.740
Okay, buddy, that's it.
Sit down.

13:17.742 --> 13:20.676
Oh, oh, what about
that tubby girl

13:20.678 --> 13:23.212
in the Sailor Moon
costume at Comic-con?

13:24.381 --> 13:26.265
Don't remember.
Please sit down.

13:26.267 --> 13:29.051
The only threesome
I've ever had in my life,

13:29.053 --> 13:32.355
and I'm proud to say it was
with this man right here.

13:35.810 --> 13:37.526
Oh, please shut up.

13:37.528 --> 13:38.978
Oh, oh, don't get me wrong,

13:38.980 --> 13:41.147
nothing happened with
me and Howard.

13:41.149 --> 13:44.734
There was about 200 pounds
of Sailor Moon between us.

13:48.538 --> 13:53.759
Oh, Internet, this is
so going all over you.

13:53.761 --> 13:56.946
Jeepers, I'm drunk.

13:58.000 --> 14:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

14:06.742 --> 14:08.506
Thank you for picking us up.

14:08.508 --> 14:10.609
There's a warning, right there,
on the scotch bottle.

14:10.611 --> 14:13.145
You cannot be
operatin' heavy machinery

14:13.147 --> 14:16.281
after you had a snootful
of this, laddie!

14:21.071 --> 14:23.405
Funny.

14:23.407 --> 14:25.156
You boys have a nice time?

14:25.158 --> 14:27.258
Yeah, it was great.

14:27.260 --> 14:28.376
Low-key, like I promised.

14:28.378 --> 14:30.578
No hanky-panky, no strippers.

14:30.580 --> 14:34.249
Just the guys telling jokes.

14:34.251 --> 14:36.418
That's nice.

14:36.420 --> 14:39.888
How about you?
Did you have a fun night?

14:39.890 --> 14:42.891
Yeah, we, uh, made
gift bags, had wine,

14:42.893 --> 14:45.643
and then went online
and saw this.

14:45.645 --> 14:49.380
Of all the "Howard
humping hookers" stories,

14:49.382 --> 14:51.099
that one's my favorite.

14:56.489 --> 14:58.606
You know, we're not that far
from my apartment.

14:58.608 --> 15:01.860
If you stop the car,
I can walk from here.

15:01.862 --> 15:05.397
You ain't goin'
anywhere, Threeway.

15:05.399 --> 15:08.616
Bernadette, listen...
You lied to me.

15:08.618 --> 15:11.119
You said you told me about all
the girls you've been with,

15:11.121 --> 15:15.707
but you never mentioned your
cousin, the prostitute or Raj!

15:15.709 --> 15:19.294
Seriously, you don't even have
to stop the car.

15:19.296 --> 15:20.912
Anything under ten miles an hour

15:20.914 --> 15:22.914
and I can combat-roll
into the street.

15:25.301 --> 15:27.552
Okay, just to set
the record straight,

15:27.554 --> 15:31.940
I didn't hire the prostitute,
she was a gift from him.

15:31.942 --> 15:33.308
Shame on you, Raj.

15:33.310 --> 15:35.927
That is not how we treat
women in this country.

15:37.446 --> 15:39.481
Don't you try and
blame this on him.

15:39.483 --> 15:41.733
- Thank you, Bernadette.
- Zip it, pervert!

15:45.037 --> 15:47.405
I don't know what
I'm going to do.

15:47.407 --> 15:49.524
I'm supposed to marry Howard
in a couple weeks

15:49.526 --> 15:52.460
and I'm not sure I even know
who the man is anymore.

15:52.462 --> 15:54.796
I'm curious
what's bothering you most:

15:54.798 --> 15:57.999
the borderline incest,
the prostitute or group sex

15:58.001 --> 16:00.969
with the girl dressed as
the children's cartoon?

16:01.837 --> 16:03.972
Amy, remember when
we went over things

16:03.974 --> 16:06.007
that would be helpful
and things that wouldn't?

16:06.009 --> 16:07.642
Right.

16:07.644 --> 16:09.928
- And that was...
- Not.

16:11.814 --> 16:14.399
When I first met Howard,
he seemed so innocent to me,

16:14.401 --> 16:16.801
just a sweet little guy who
lives with his mother.

16:16.803 --> 16:18.803
Well, if that's what
you like, I'll take you

16:18.805 --> 16:21.322
to the comic book store--
the place is full of 'em.

16:22.258 --> 16:24.692
Wait a minute.

16:24.694 --> 16:26.811
You set me up with Howard.

16:27.413 --> 16:28.413
Did you know about

16:28.415 --> 16:30.148
all the creepy stuff
he was into?

16:30.150 --> 16:32.534
Well, a little.
You hear stuff...

16:35.070 --> 16:37.071
Why didn't you tell me

16:37.073 --> 16:38.256
Well, I was gonna,
but I didn't think

16:38.258 --> 16:39.908
it would go past
the first date.

16:39.910 --> 16:41.793
Then, when it did,
I thought for sure

16:41.795 --> 16:43.461
it wouldn't go past
you meeting his mother.

16:43.463 --> 16:45.380
Definitely not past the
two of you sleeping together.

16:45.382 --> 16:50.101
I mean, the warning signs were
there-- this is really on you.

16:50.103 --> 16:50.919
God!

16:50.921 --> 16:52.720
I thought you were
my friend.

16:58.528 --> 17:00.178
I don't think
that was helpful.

17:02.948 --> 17:05.066
Hi, Bernie, it's me again.

17:05.068 --> 17:07.285
Please call me back.

17:07.287 --> 17:09.737
Dude, I am so sorry.

17:09.739 --> 17:12.022
It's not your fault,
it's mine.

17:12.025 --> 17:14.409
I did all that stuff,
not you.

17:14.411 --> 17:17.361
Actually, you did do
one of them together.

17:18.414 --> 17:20.196
Here.

17:20.199 --> 17:21.281
What is this?

17:21.284 --> 17:22.366
You're upset.

17:22.367 --> 17:23.334
The convention is to

17:23.336 --> 17:25.002
bring an upset person
a hot beverage.

17:25.005 --> 17:26.621
No, but what is it?

17:26.623 --> 17:27.555
Chicken broth.

17:27.557 --> 17:30.008
It seemed culturally
appropriate.

17:31.227 --> 17:33.011
Also, there was a single cube
of chicken bouillon

17:33.013 --> 17:34.596
in the cupboard when I moved in

17:34.598 --> 17:38.099
and it's been bothering me
for the last eight years...

17:38.101 --> 17:40.318
So, as they say, two birds.

17:41.937 --> 17:44.439
I don't know what
my next move is.

17:44.441 --> 17:47.275
Well, Howard, I don't know
much about women...

17:47.277 --> 17:49.561
- Yeah?
- No, uh, that, that's it.

17:49.563 --> 17:51.713
I don't know much about women.

17:53.115 --> 17:54.816
Raj, you got anything?

17:54.818 --> 17:58.069
I've got the phone number of
the tubby girl from Comic-Con.

18:00.072 --> 18:02.757
I'm not calling the
girl from Comic-con.

18:02.759 --> 18:04.008
All right.

18:04.010 --> 18:06.461
More Sailor Moon for me.

18:08.430 --> 18:11.082
I just threw up
the bachelor party.

18:14.270 --> 18:15.853
Please come out, Bernadette.

18:15.855 --> 18:17.355
Let's talk through this.

18:17.357 --> 18:18.840
No, leave me alone.

18:18.842 --> 18:22.393
Perhaps you should give him
a taste of his own medicine.

18:22.395 --> 18:24.279
Do you have a cousin
who you find attractive?

18:24.281 --> 18:27.682
Amy.

18:27.684 --> 18:29.367
Hey, you introduced him
to the sleazebag.

18:29.369 --> 18:31.936
I'm just trying to
clean up your mess.

18:33.605 --> 18:35.056
Oh, hi.

18:35.058 --> 18:36.207
Hi.

18:36.209 --> 18:38.293
I need to talk to Bernadette.

18:38.295 --> 18:41.612
Well, I don't think she wants
to talk to anyone right now.

18:41.614 --> 18:45.967
All right, well, could you
at least give her a message?

18:45.969 --> 18:47.785
Yeah, sure, I guess.

18:47.787 --> 18:51.589
Tell her I'm really sorry.

18:51.591 --> 18:56.928
And if she doesn't want
to marry me, I get it.

18:56.930 --> 18:59.347
But what I really
want her to know

18:59.349 --> 19:01.632
is the guy that
she's disgusted by,

19:01.634 --> 19:03.768
is the guy that
I'm disgusted by, too.

19:03.770 --> 19:06.821
But that guy doesn't
exist anymore; he's gone.

19:06.823 --> 19:11.909
And the reason is
because of her.

19:11.911 --> 19:17.332
So, if this
relationship is over,

19:17.334 --> 19:21.452
let her know that
she made me a better man,

19:21.454 --> 19:25.923
and tell her thank you.

19:25.925 --> 19:29.727
Oh, my God, Howard.

19:29.729 --> 19:34.265
That's the most beautiful
thing I've ever heard.

19:34.267 --> 19:38.436
And it came out of you.

19:39.421 --> 19:42.106
Howie?

19:42.108 --> 19:45.360
Penny has a message for you.

19:45.362 --> 19:47.278
I heard.

19:47.280 --> 19:50.765
Your voice, not unlike your
mother's, travels through walls.

19:50.767 --> 19:53.234
Do you want me to go?

19:53.236 --> 19:54.819
No.

19:55.354 --> 19:56.687
Come here.

20:02.027 --> 20:03.828
I'm still really
mad at you.

20:03.830 --> 20:05.696
I get that.

20:05.698 --> 20:08.332
Is there anything else about
your past I should know?

20:08.334 --> 20:11.169
Couple things, but, you know,
most of them happened overseas.

20:11.171 --> 20:13.337
I'll tell you later.

20:15.174 --> 20:16.491
Okay.

20:16.493 --> 20:18.843
So, is the wedding still on?

20:18.845 --> 20:22.180
Yeah, the wedding's still on.

20:23.716 --> 20:25.633
Oh, thank God.

20:25.635 --> 20:28.369
I'm still a maid of honor!

20:29.721 --> 20:32.273
Oh, what the hell.

20:33.192 --> 20:35.426
This is kind of hot.

20:45.525 --> 20:47.859
Hello.

20:47.861 --> 20:49.711
What's with the robe?

20:49.713 --> 20:52.080
I'm gonna have sex with you
right here,

20:52.082 --> 20:54.299
right now, on that
washing machine.

20:57.220 --> 20:59.071
No, you're not.

20:59.073 --> 21:02.090
Come on, please.

21:03.593 --> 21:05.043
If you want to do something,

21:05.045 --> 21:07.446
you can help me
fold this sheet.

21:08.765 --> 21:11.316
Folding a sheet in my underwear,
still pretty crazy.
