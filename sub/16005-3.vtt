00:20.937 --> 00:23.207
We have a situation.
We need your help.

00:23.275 --> 00:25.110
Honey, not that kind
of situation.

00:25.178 --> 00:27.214
Poor man probably thinks
I'm gonna give birth

00:27.282 --> 00:28.550
to the baby right here
on the floor.

00:28.617 --> 00:30.252
I just need to use
your bathroom.

00:30.320 --> 00:31.321
Wait a minute.
Hold on.

00:31.355 --> 00:32.990
- How'd you get in here?
- We got lost.

00:33.058 --> 00:36.262
We're from out of town...
First light we saw.

00:36.330 --> 00:38.500
Please, sir, I'm burstin'.

00:42.975 --> 00:45.045
Just you.

00:45.112 --> 00:47.983
Second door on the right.
Your husband has to wait here.

00:48.051 --> 00:49.385
Thank you.
Thank you.

00:49.453 --> 00:51.990
Good Karma will come to you.

01:03.477 --> 01:04.644
First kid?

01:07.885 --> 01:10.956
Yeah. Have to say,
I'm a little nervous.

01:13.745 --> 01:15.931
Ah, don't worry.

01:15.999 --> 01:18.269
Pretty soon, you'll be
too tired to be nervous.

01:20.172 --> 01:21.274
Hey, what's going on?

01:21.341 --> 01:23.545
You stay here.
Is my wife okay?

01:23.612 --> 01:25.047
Stay here!

01:31.392 --> 01:33.061
It took you a full 30 seconds?

01:33.129 --> 01:34.463
You're getting slow
in your old age.

01:34.531 --> 01:35.799
Just be careful.

01:35.867 --> 01:37.502
No one's getting busted
this time.

01:58.439 --> 01:59.807
Whoo!

01:59.874 --> 02:02.812
No one I'd rather steal
major explosives with than you.

02:02.879 --> 02:04.281
I can't believe you want
to give this all up,

02:04.350 --> 02:05.383
go completely legit.

02:05.451 --> 02:06.952
Well, obviously not completely.

02:07.020 --> 02:09.156
<i>That's my girl.</i>

02:09.223 --> 02:10.993
<i>So what's this new job</i>

02:11.060 --> 02:13.731
you're so secret about?

02:13.798 --> 02:15.033
I can't talk about it.

02:15.101 --> 02:16.637
Ah, whatever it is,

02:16.704 --> 02:18.840
I'm sure you're working
your angle.

02:18.907 --> 02:20.509
Maybe.
So what about you?

02:20.577 --> 02:22.028
You got any big plans?

02:22.114 --> 02:24.249
Baby, I just spent
four years in the joint.

02:24.317 --> 02:25.568
<i>I'm gonna party.</i>

02:29.192 --> 02:30.861
Okay, get out of here.

02:30.928 --> 02:33.532
Thanks, Ames.
Knew I could count on you.

02:33.600 --> 02:36.270
Brody...

02:36.338 --> 02:37.873
Watch your back.

02:37.940 --> 02:39.175
Why?

02:39.243 --> 02:40.944
That's what I got you for.

02:41.012 --> 02:43.349
Yeah.

03:01.214 --> 03:02.582
Oh, crap.

03:05.956 --> 03:08.292
Yeah, let's see what you got.

03:51.401 --> 03:52.736
Okay, look...

03:52.804 --> 03:54.872
I don't know who you are
or what you want,

03:54.940 --> 03:58.212
but I'm sure we can figure
something out.

03:58.280 --> 03:59.381
Let's just calmly discu...

03:59.448 --> 04:01.050
Uhh! Ah!

04:03.254 --> 04:05.424
<i>Unh!</i>

04:05.492 --> 04:09.464
Do you realize
this is my wrench?

04:09.532 --> 04:11.100
What are you doing here?

04:11.168 --> 04:14.507
I could be asking you
the same question.

04:50.502 --> 04:51.920
We vouched for you!

04:51.988 --> 04:54.069
The only reason you're here
is because we swore to Ilsa

04:54.169 --> 04:55.887
that you wouldn't step across
the line back into crime!

04:55.972 --> 04:57.707
I didn't step across the line.

04:57.774 --> 04:59.811
I rappelled over it.

04:59.878 --> 05:02.014
I was pregnant, mind you.

05:02.082 --> 05:05.621
You think this is funny?

05:05.688 --> 05:07.557
No, I don't think it's funny.

05:07.625 --> 05:10.128
<i>I get uncomfortable
in these kind of situations,</i>

05:10.196 --> 05:11.865
okay?

05:11.933 --> 05:14.469
I'm sorry.
I screwed up.

05:17.108 --> 05:19.277
Out of curiosity,
why were you following me?

05:19.345 --> 05:20.713
Oh, gee, I don't know.

05:20.781 --> 05:23.151
Maybe because last night
you lied to us,

05:23.219 --> 05:24.820
<i>led us to believe
you're on your team,</i>

05:24.888 --> 05:25.889
<i>then stole some
of guerrero's tools</i>

05:25.957 --> 05:27.492
<i>to commit a felony.</i>

05:27.559 --> 05:29.663
He doesn't know... yet.

05:29.730 --> 05:30.897
Okay, look...

05:30.965 --> 05:32.834
An old friend needed a favor.

05:32.902 --> 05:34.470
I-i helped him out.

05:34.538 --> 05:36.123
What's his name?

05:37.643 --> 05:39.346
What is his name?

05:39.414 --> 05:41.482
Brody... Rivera.

05:41.550 --> 05:43.486
Keep talking.

05:43.554 --> 05:44.714
What, you want my life story?

05:44.756 --> 05:46.324
No, just the juicy parts

05:46.392 --> 05:48.361
- that pertain to...
- Mr. Rivera.

05:48.429 --> 05:50.030
It's not like that.

05:50.098 --> 05:51.600
He's not my boyfriend.
He...

05:51.668 --> 05:52.668
He's like my brother.

05:52.736 --> 05:54.639
We raised each other, okay?

05:54.707 --> 05:55.808
We met in a foster home,

05:55.875 --> 05:57.110
and we've been together
ever since.

05:57.178 --> 06:00.282
After-school-special
enough for you?

06:00.349 --> 06:02.118
I ain't moved yet.

06:02.186 --> 06:03.203
Hello?

06:04.824 --> 06:07.127
Hello?

06:09.866 --> 06:11.468
Mr. Markus?

06:11.519 --> 06:12.970
Hello?

06:18.214 --> 06:19.882
Hello, Brody.

06:24.825 --> 06:27.362
You know Yuri.
Yeah, always a pleasure.

06:27.430 --> 06:29.165
So I got what you needed.

06:29.233 --> 06:31.068
Kind of want to settle up.

06:32.906 --> 06:35.242
Ames, this is serious.

06:35.309 --> 06:36.544
When we're in the field,

06:36.612 --> 06:38.080
we need to know
we can trust the people

06:38.149 --> 06:39.583
who are watching our backs.

06:39.651 --> 06:40.952
<i>Lives depend on it.</i>

06:41.020 --> 06:45.360
You can trust me.

06:45.427 --> 06:49.100
Okay, look...
You know, a few years back,

06:49.168 --> 06:50.301
before I was reformed,

06:50.369 --> 06:52.739
I pulled a bunch
of jobs with Brody,

06:52.807 --> 06:55.877
one of which
was a jewelry store.

06:55.946 --> 06:57.648
He got nabbed, and I owe him.

06:57.715 --> 07:00.452
He didn't turn you in?
Did the full load?

07:00.520 --> 07:03.090
Yeah, he did four years for me.

07:03.158 --> 07:04.660
In hindsight,
yeah, you know what?

07:04.727 --> 07:06.931
It was a bad call.

07:06.998 --> 07:08.500
I'm sorry.

07:13.542 --> 07:15.896
- Are you gonna tell the boss?
- <i>No, you are.</i>

07:18.384 --> 07:20.520
Good morning.

07:20.589 --> 07:24.260
What's everyone doing here
so bright and early?

07:27.166 --> 07:28.500
Mrs. pucci,

07:28.568 --> 07:29.836
uh, Ilsa,

07:29.904 --> 07:33.710
could, um, we talk in private?

07:33.777 --> 07:35.379
You had help last night.

07:35.447 --> 07:37.116
Tell me about the girl.
Any good?

07:37.184 --> 07:38.117
<i>Oh, she's the best.</i>

07:38.185 --> 07:39.954
I've known her my whole life.

07:40.005 --> 07:41.624
We're, like, related.

07:41.675 --> 07:44.028
I checked her out.

07:44.096 --> 07:45.631
So...

07:45.698 --> 07:47.200
You two want to get
rich tonight?

07:47.268 --> 07:48.669
What do you mean?

07:48.737 --> 07:50.472
How about we double down?

07:50.539 --> 07:51.741
Got a job.

07:51.808 --> 07:54.078
I lost my demos and alarms man.

07:54.146 --> 07:57.083
Take should be
in the seven figures.

07:59.222 --> 08:00.423
Yeah...

08:00.491 --> 08:02.526
I might be interested.

08:02.594 --> 08:05.431
What do you think
she's feeding her?

08:05.499 --> 08:07.502
Whatever it is,
Ilsa's eating it up.

08:07.569 --> 08:09.873
What about you?

08:09.941 --> 08:12.343
I don't know.

08:12.394 --> 08:13.578
It's hard to say no

08:13.646 --> 08:15.950
to somebody
that does time for you.

08:16.017 --> 08:17.852
What happens when he asks again?

08:17.920 --> 08:19.439
<i>Well, I think
we've had a good talk.</i>

08:19.524 --> 08:20.524
<i>Totally.</i>

08:20.591 --> 08:21.793
Again, I'm sorry
about last night.

08:21.860 --> 08:23.362
Boy trouble...
It won't happen again.

08:23.430 --> 08:25.466
Well, it's perfectly
understandable.

08:25.534 --> 08:27.804
But, Ms. Ames,

08:27.871 --> 08:29.306
if your personal life

08:29.374 --> 08:32.378
complicates my professional life
in any way, you're done here.

08:37.153 --> 08:39.222
Understood.

08:39.291 --> 08:40.392
Good.

08:53.546 --> 08:55.049
<i>Don't ask what about.</i>

08:55.108 --> 08:56.610
Just say, "thank you."

08:56.661 --> 08:57.979
Brody, look,
w-we need to talk.

08:58.047 --> 08:59.773
I don't want to be involved
in this stuff anymore.

08:59.873 --> 09:01.141
What's your problem?

09:01.209 --> 09:02.977
My problem...
It's the people I work for.

09:03.045 --> 09:05.482
It just puts me
in a compromising position.

09:05.550 --> 09:07.285
- So quit.
- It's not that easy.

09:07.353 --> 09:08.988
Yeah, it is.

09:09.056 --> 09:10.841
Ames, I just got us in
on the score of a lifetime.

09:10.926 --> 09:12.094
Better start saying
"thank you" fast,

09:12.161 --> 09:13.396
because we're about
to get stinking rich.

09:13.464 --> 09:14.798
Brody, I told you last night

09:14.866 --> 09:16.167
I'm not in the game.

09:16.218 --> 09:17.837
And seven figures
doesn't change your mind?

09:17.904 --> 09:19.907
No, I made a commit...

09:19.975 --> 09:21.643
Seven figures?

09:21.711 --> 09:23.446
For five hours of work.

09:23.514 --> 09:25.650
What are they paying you
at the burger shack?

09:25.718 --> 09:27.420
<i>It's a little more involved
than that.</i>

09:27.488 --> 09:30.058
- He's a bad kid.
- No, he's not.

09:30.126 --> 09:31.193
I know bad people.

09:31.261 --> 09:32.695
- This kid isn't bad.
- He's a punk.

09:32.747 --> 09:34.228
Show me some bodies,
then we can talk.

09:34.266 --> 09:36.369
Quiet, guys.
I want to see if she bites.

09:36.437 --> 09:39.090
<i>See if she's still worth saving.</i>

09:39.175 --> 09:40.943
Ames, we do this, it's over.

09:41.011 --> 09:42.880
We can live
whatever life we want.

09:42.948 --> 09:44.517
Don't do it.

09:44.584 --> 09:47.155
Of course she's gonna do it.
I would.

09:47.222 --> 09:49.258
What?

09:49.325 --> 09:50.806
Hey, when I'm off duty,
you don't want

09:50.861 --> 09:52.396
to follow me either.

09:52.447 --> 09:54.801
That's all I'm saying.

09:54.868 --> 09:57.255
<i>What do we got?</i>

09:57.339 --> 09:58.908
Whatever you decide,
just do it fast, you know,

09:58.975 --> 10:00.677
'cause here comes
our ride.
What?

10:00.745 --> 10:02.815
I swear I thought you'd be in.

10:02.882 --> 10:04.217
<i>Look, I got your back.</i>

10:04.268 --> 10:05.286
<i>Whoa.</i>

10:05.353 --> 10:06.988
<i>That, my friends,
is Andre Markus.</i>

10:07.056 --> 10:08.591
This just got a whole lot worse.

10:08.659 --> 10:10.328
Yeah, there's an understatement.

10:10.396 --> 10:11.629
You know this Markus guy?

10:11.698 --> 10:13.766
Not many in law enforcement
that don't.

10:13.818 --> 10:16.655
<i>His jobs tend to get
a bit messy, dude.</i>

10:16.739 --> 10:18.959
For clarification,
Andre Markus...

10:19.044 --> 10:20.645
There's a bad guy,

10:20.713 --> 10:23.450
<i>which means Ames is
in some serious trouble.</i>

10:27.658 --> 10:29.928
Tough locks last night...

10:29.996 --> 10:31.231
Nice work.

10:31.298 --> 10:33.969
Thanks.

10:34.036 --> 10:37.307
Measurements?
Waist?

10:37.375 --> 10:39.211
What, you looking for a date?

10:44.520 --> 10:47.826
Looking for someone
slimmer than 27 inches

10:47.894 --> 10:49.662
who can run a feedback surge

10:49.730 --> 10:51.331
through a delco laser
security system

10:51.400 --> 10:54.738
and knock it out
in less than 15 seconds.

10:54.805 --> 10:56.407
Think you can handle that?

11:00.315 --> 11:01.716
Don't do it.

11:01.784 --> 11:05.089
Ask last night's late shift.

11:07.227 --> 11:09.196
Damn it.

11:09.247 --> 11:13.002
She'll do.

11:13.070 --> 11:14.538
But any problems,
it's on you, Brody.

11:14.606 --> 11:16.275
Yuri will explain on the way
to meet the rest of the team.

11:16.343 --> 11:17.744
Well, who are they?

11:17.812 --> 11:19.113
You'll never know.

11:19.181 --> 11:21.885
That way, if you get busted,
everyone's anonymous.

11:21.953 --> 11:23.554
<i>You're gonna have code names.</i>

11:23.622 --> 11:26.693
You're "London."
Brody, "Dallas."

11:26.760 --> 11:28.062
<i>"Boise" and "Memphis"</i>

11:28.129 --> 11:30.099
are waiting for you
back at the launch site

11:30.167 --> 11:32.603
<i>and "Chicago"
is on his way from Vegas.</i>

11:34.407 --> 11:37.762
Now I hope, for your two's sake,

11:37.846 --> 11:39.916
this is the last time
you ever set eyes on me.

11:51.536 --> 11:54.073
Well, there she goes,
back to a life of crime.

11:54.141 --> 11:57.078
I knew it.
I knew this girl was bad news.

11:57.147 --> 11:59.449
She didn't have a choice, dude.
She was being loyal.

11:59.517 --> 12:02.137
To a criminal?

12:02.222 --> 12:03.523
No offense.

12:03.591 --> 12:05.627
<i>What was she supposed to do?</i>

12:12.039 --> 12:13.507
Hello?

12:13.575 --> 12:15.978
Hey.
What you up to?

12:16.046 --> 12:17.948
Not much.

12:18.016 --> 12:19.284
How about you?

12:19.352 --> 12:21.721
<i>You know, uh, just chillin'.</i>

12:23.459 --> 12:25.862
Um, i-i think I have
a new client for the team.

12:25.930 --> 12:28.049
Oh, yeah?
Who'd that be?

12:28.133 --> 12:30.703
Me.

12:30.771 --> 12:33.909
I-I'm in a bit of trouble.

12:52.145 --> 12:53.225
How do you want to play it?

12:53.565 --> 12:56.077
Well, cut her loose,
let the chips fall.

12:56.370 --> 12:57.381
Or?

12:57.481 --> 12:58.916
Get involved, see it through.

12:58.984 --> 13:00.786
I'm not much
of a spectator, dude.

13:00.854 --> 13:03.424
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait a minute, now.

13:03.475 --> 13:06.028
Let's just take a moment
to clarify.

13:06.096 --> 13:08.299
We've only known this girl
for a couple of weeks,

13:08.367 --> 13:09.735
and we're prepared
to aid and abet

13:09.803 --> 13:11.037
a major felony for her?

13:11.105 --> 13:12.372
Well, I suppose we could always

13:12.441 --> 13:13.641
just let Markus kill her.

13:13.709 --> 13:14.910
Well, it's up to you.

13:14.977 --> 13:16.697
We're either all-in,
or we're all-out.

13:16.781 --> 13:20.453
Is she worth it?

13:20.520 --> 13:23.893
Just to be clear, boys...

13:23.960 --> 13:25.695
I ain't sharing a cell
with either of you.

13:25.763 --> 13:26.764
It's your first heist.

13:26.798 --> 13:28.233
Just sit back
and enjoy the ride.

13:28.301 --> 13:30.771
- Train station?
- Yeah.

13:49.231 --> 13:50.588
I'm Chicago.

13:50.688 --> 13:51.739
Great.

13:51.823 --> 13:53.325
Welcome to San Fran,
Mr. Chicago.

13:53.392 --> 13:54.460
Where you headed?

13:54.528 --> 13:57.098
Aren't you supposed
to know that?

13:57.166 --> 13:59.202
Not the way Mr. Markus works.

13:59.270 --> 14:00.872
The less people that know,
the better.

14:00.939 --> 14:03.977
Car's this way.

14:04.044 --> 14:05.613
What, you want to get
some other ride?

14:05.680 --> 14:07.433
Show up with a taxi driver
at the location?

14:07.518 --> 14:09.052
Dude, cool by me.

14:09.120 --> 14:10.788
I got a stepkid who could use
a ride to a flute lesson.

14:10.856 --> 14:14.428
Hold on.

14:14.496 --> 14:16.766
Potrero hill.

14:16.834 --> 14:20.338
Cold drink for you?

14:20.406 --> 14:22.175
Car's over here.

14:25.115 --> 14:26.315
Hey, thanks for doing this.

14:26.384 --> 14:27.334
Yeah, well, you can thank me

14:27.418 --> 14:29.421
when this is over
and you're alive.

14:29.489 --> 14:31.859
<i>We've been
in worse situations before.</i>

14:34.063 --> 14:35.464
Hey, so, uh,
what's the score?
<i>I told you.</i>

14:35.515 --> 14:37.234
No details
until everyone's here.

14:48.522 --> 14:49.823
Who is it?

14:49.891 --> 14:52.861
I'm Chicago.

14:52.929 --> 14:54.497
So...

14:54.565 --> 14:58.838
What's the job?

14:58.906 --> 15:01.543
You're Chicago?

15:01.611 --> 15:04.548
From your reputation,
i thought you'd be bigger.

15:04.616 --> 15:07.186
Mug shots add pounds.

15:07.254 --> 15:09.957
When that facial-recognition
software hit the market,

15:10.025 --> 15:11.426
<i>I hit the gym.</i>

15:11.494 --> 15:13.714
Less pounds, less trouble.

15:13.798 --> 15:17.037
My cholesterol is way down.

15:17.105 --> 15:19.340
So you fellas
want to talk fitness,

15:19.408 --> 15:21.244
or do you want to tell me
why Mr. Markus

15:21.312 --> 15:23.281
brought me all the way
from las Vegas?

15:27.990 --> 15:30.092
Okay.

15:30.160 --> 15:33.732
<i>Everyone gather round.</i>

15:33.800 --> 15:34.868
Thank you.

15:34.935 --> 15:36.470
How'd you find me?

15:36.538 --> 15:37.706
I was in the neighborhood,

15:37.774 --> 15:39.242
thought I might get rich
on a job I knew nothing about

15:39.310 --> 15:40.844
with some people I can't trust.

15:40.912 --> 15:42.247
Look, I'm sorry I tried
to get out of it.

15:42.315 --> 15:43.516
You need to help Brody.

15:43.583 --> 15:45.285
He doesn't know you're with me.

15:45.353 --> 15:46.888
Well, now that we're all here,

15:46.955 --> 15:48.775
<i>we can learn some details.</i>

15:48.859 --> 15:51.296
The location...

15:51.364 --> 15:55.337
<i>San Francisco
metropolitan museum.</i>

15:55.404 --> 15:57.439
<i>And the target...
Diamonds.</i>

15:57.491 --> 16:00.712
The three sisters of antwerp.

16:00.779 --> 16:02.147
What'd I tell you?

16:02.216 --> 16:03.984
<i>We're gonna be rich.</i>

16:04.052 --> 16:05.287
Yeah.

16:05.355 --> 16:08.058
- You get that?
- Loud and clear.

16:08.126 --> 16:09.627
<i>You will have
a four-minute window</i>

16:09.695 --> 16:10.930
<i>to rig and detonate</i>

16:10.997 --> 16:13.100
<i>a thermoset
polycarbonate casing.</i>

16:13.168 --> 16:15.070
Those diamonds are worth
at least $50 million.

16:15.138 --> 16:16.523
<i>It's gonna be fort Knox-like
security over there.</i>

16:16.607 --> 16:18.810
Sounds like fun. What are you
gonna do with your cut?

16:18.878 --> 16:20.480
I am a simple man.

16:20.547 --> 16:22.516
Couple pairs of nice shoes,

16:22.584 --> 16:24.186
<i>300-foot yacht...
That's all I need.</i>

16:24.254 --> 16:27.191
There will be an exhibition
open to the public,

16:27.259 --> 16:28.627
however, the diamonds
will be gone,

16:28.695 --> 16:30.630
courtesy of us.

16:30.698 --> 16:33.335
You all know your jobs.

16:33.403 --> 16:35.038
Do them,

16:35.106 --> 16:37.692
no problem.

16:37.778 --> 16:40.815
I got a question.

16:40.883 --> 16:43.319
What's your job?

16:43.387 --> 16:46.491
To make sure you do yours.

16:52.269 --> 16:53.904
<i>What's the word on what
I'm supposed to be doing here?</i>

16:53.971 --> 16:55.440
I'm still waiting on guerrero.

16:55.507 --> 16:58.061
He's driving Chicago
all over town.

16:58.145 --> 16:59.626
<i>Took a while
for the rohypnol to work.</i>

17:05.057 --> 17:07.394
Hmm, still hard at work, I see.

17:07.462 --> 17:09.498
Uh, just doing
a little research.

17:09.566 --> 17:11.667
You better not put in
for any overtime.

17:12.871 --> 17:15.508
Oh, the three sisters.

17:15.576 --> 17:16.844
Yeah, so you know them?

17:16.911 --> 17:18.079
Yeah, I just saw them.

17:18.146 --> 17:21.084
The museum had
a previewing event for donors.

17:21.152 --> 17:23.955
Any chance you're not just
brushing up for a tour tomorrow?

17:24.022 --> 17:25.458
Listen, Ilsa,

17:25.526 --> 17:27.295
we kind of did
some recon on Ames,

17:27.363 --> 17:29.031
and it led us down
a rabbit hole.

17:29.099 --> 17:31.236
Meaning what exactly?

17:31.303 --> 17:33.305
Meaning...

17:33.373 --> 17:35.743
She and some accomplices
are planning to hit the museum.

17:35.811 --> 17:38.114
Hit?

17:38.182 --> 17:40.217
You mean steal the diamonds?

17:40.285 --> 17:42.255
Well, we have to call
the police,

17:42.322 --> 17:43.657
stop this immediately.

17:43.725 --> 17:44.825
Well done, Winston.

17:44.894 --> 17:46.495
Uh, afraid we can't do that.

17:46.563 --> 17:50.167
W-well, you realize that
would make us accessories?

17:50.235 --> 17:52.906
W-we'd be complicit
after the fact,

17:52.973 --> 17:55.010
aiding and abetting...
Abetting a felony, yes.

17:55.077 --> 17:56.318
I'm well aware of the law, Ilsa.

17:56.346 --> 17:57.781
The problem is the only way
we're gonna pull

17:57.849 --> 17:59.048
Ames and her friend out
of this alive

17:59.148 --> 18:00.587
is to see it through
and bust the guy behind it.

18:00.687 --> 18:02.189
And how are we gonna do that...

18:02.315 --> 18:06.087
Guarantee no one gets hurt?

18:08.935 --> 18:11.471
Chance is with her.

18:11.539 --> 18:12.932
<i>Chance, can you hear me?</i>

18:13.032 --> 18:14.033
This is Ilsa.

18:14.309 --> 18:16.512
Could you lower your voice while
i still have some hearing left?

18:16.580 --> 18:18.615
Oh, oh, sorry.

18:18.683 --> 18:21.866
<i>Look, let the girl go.
She's betrayed us.</i>

18:21.966 --> 18:24.235
I'm calling the police,
and that's an order.

18:24.286 --> 18:27.741
Winston...

18:27.809 --> 18:29.944
Could you tell Ilsa
i don't do well with orders?

18:30.012 --> 18:32.716
<i>Ilsa, we can't pull out.</i>

18:32.784 --> 18:34.219
They know too much about her.

18:34.287 --> 18:36.289
If we pull out now, she's dead.

18:36.357 --> 18:37.691
Trust me.

18:37.759 --> 18:39.695
This is the only way
to save her.

18:42.166 --> 18:43.601
All right.

18:43.669 --> 18:45.605
Really, it's gonna be fine.

18:45.673 --> 18:48.043
I'm all over it.
Chance is all over it.

18:48.111 --> 18:49.579
We're both professionals.

18:51.249 --> 18:52.551
<i>Yo!</i>

18:52.618 --> 18:54.220
You want to, uh, grab
my battery?

18:54.288 --> 18:56.758
It's in the elevator.

18:56.825 --> 18:58.060
Could also use
a bucket of water.

18:58.128 --> 18:59.529
Oh, hi, boss.
Nice dress.

18:59.597 --> 19:02.434
What are you doing?
Are you torturing that man?

19:02.502 --> 19:04.805
Well, not yet.

19:04.873 --> 19:06.808
<i>I'm on the board
of amnesty international.</i>

19:06.876 --> 19:09.680
This is
the Marshall pucci foundation.

19:09.748 --> 19:10.949
We save people.

19:11.016 --> 19:13.921
Uh, it kind of defeats
the purpose of a hood

19:13.989 --> 19:16.491
<i>when you tell him where we are.</i>

19:16.559 --> 19:18.963
- Call the police.
- Everybody, let's just calm down.

19:19.030 --> 19:20.800
Fine.
I'll call them.

19:20.867 --> 19:22.052
<i>Ilsa!</i>

19:22.136 --> 19:23.905
I'm not sure I can let you
do that, boss.

19:25.108 --> 19:28.045
Hello?
Police?

19:32.187 --> 19:35.324
<i>Hello, ma'am?</i>

19:35.392 --> 19:37.328
I'll call you back.

19:41.970 --> 19:42.904
Chicago?

19:42.972 --> 19:43.973
<i>Yeah?</i>

19:44.008 --> 19:47.679
You're on.

19:47.747 --> 19:49.683
I'm looking forward
to seeing you work.

19:49.751 --> 19:51.886
Oh, I don't want to show off.

19:56.763 --> 19:58.204
Well, it appears
I'm gonna be graded.

19:58.265 --> 20:02.705
Any idea what my job is?

20:02.773 --> 20:04.542
<i>Winston?</i>

20:04.609 --> 20:07.129
<i>Winston?</i>

20:17.181 --> 20:18.766
You okay?

20:18.834 --> 20:20.602
Yeah.

20:20.670 --> 20:23.742
One way to pick a lock, I guess.

20:23.810 --> 20:26.413
Serial number's gone.

20:26.481 --> 20:27.782
<i>Grip sanded.</i>

20:27.850 --> 20:29.919
This guy ain't
the getaway driver.

20:29.986 --> 20:32.824
Not with a silencer...
My guess he's the cleaner.

20:32.891 --> 20:36.864
What's a cleaner?

20:45.196 --> 20:46.447
Who is he?

20:46.515 --> 20:48.183
This whole job was his idea.

20:48.251 --> 20:50.788
Came to Markus
with a foolproof plan.

20:50.856 --> 20:52.023
<i>He overlooked
one detail, though.</i>

20:52.091 --> 20:54.728
We don't need him anymore.

20:54.796 --> 20:56.364
So do your job.

20:56.432 --> 20:58.301
Kill him.

21:01.341 --> 21:03.427
No problem.

21:10.538 --> 21:11.372
Kill him.

21:11.377 --> 21:12.845
Anymore details you need
to extract?

21:12.913 --> 21:14.048
I don't mind a good torture?

21:14.115 --> 21:16.052
That's enough talk.

21:16.119 --> 21:17.654
You do it now,

21:17.722 --> 21:19.457
or I do, and then I do you.

21:27.739 --> 21:29.375
Trust me.

21:30.979 --> 21:33.097
So if I'm demo
and you're alarms,

21:33.182 --> 21:35.619
<i>those two are security,</i>

21:35.686 --> 21:38.690
what do you think
Chicago's here for?

21:38.758 --> 21:41.428
Protection.

22:05.305 --> 22:07.307
Good.

22:07.374 --> 22:08.826
Now, after they have done
their jobs,

22:08.910 --> 22:10.913
you take them all out...

22:10.981 --> 22:12.082
Except for the girl.

22:12.150 --> 22:14.820
I'll take care of her myself.

22:14.888 --> 22:18.092
Now, clean this up
and get yourself ready.

22:25.072 --> 22:26.773
Hang in there.
Hang in there.

22:26.841 --> 22:29.111
Come on, buddy.
Come on. All right.

22:31.183 --> 22:33.235
Don't die on me.
Come on, man.

22:35.657 --> 22:37.375
Come on.

22:37.460 --> 22:39.763
Damn it.
Breathe. Breathe. Come on.

22:39.831 --> 22:41.332
Come on.
Come on, man.

22:41.400 --> 22:42.935
Hey, hey.

22:45.774 --> 22:47.342
Hey, hey, hey.

22:47.411 --> 22:49.913
It's gonna be okay.
You're gonna be all right.

22:49.981 --> 22:53.687
Stay quiet.
EMT is coming.

22:53.755 --> 22:54.889
I'm sorry.

22:57.795 --> 22:59.748
Hey, we're back.

22:59.832 --> 23:01.567
Uh, we had a little trouble.

23:01.618 --> 23:03.670
We found out what your job is.

23:03.738 --> 23:06.308
Thanks.
Little late.

23:06.376 --> 23:07.911
So did I.

23:13.021 --> 23:16.727
<i>Move it. Hurry up.</i>

23:16.795 --> 23:18.163
Hey.

23:18.230 --> 23:20.099
You ever find out
what your job is?

23:20.167 --> 23:22.737
Yeah.

23:28.882 --> 23:31.018
Go.

23:35.394 --> 23:37.896
Not you, London.
You stay with me.

23:37.964 --> 23:40.802
- You okay?
- Go.

23:42.806 --> 23:43.974
Don't worry about me.

23:44.042 --> 23:45.944
Just take care of him.

23:46.011 --> 23:48.014
Winston, Yuri's got Ames.

23:48.082 --> 23:49.450
<i>He's gonna kill her.</i>

23:49.518 --> 23:52.322
As long as she's got a job
to do, he'll keep her alive.

23:52.389 --> 23:54.693
<i>You just find her.</i>

23:54.760 --> 23:57.264
Wait, wait.
D-did he say "Yuri"?

24:04.777 --> 24:05.945
Hey, bud.

24:06.013 --> 24:07.982
I hear you got a busted sink.

24:08.049 --> 24:08.984
Let me check.

24:09.051 --> 24:10.219
You want to live?

24:10.287 --> 24:13.358
Stay quiet.

24:13.425 --> 24:14.994
Yuri?

24:15.062 --> 24:16.329
You know him?

24:16.380 --> 24:20.003
No, just by rep.
He's a cleaner.

24:20.070 --> 24:24.510
They hired two of us
for one job.

24:24.561 --> 24:26.723
I guess you weren't gonna cross
the finish line either.

24:26.749 --> 24:28.852
<i>Your friend Markus plays dirty.</i>

24:28.920 --> 24:31.255
He's not my friend.

24:31.323 --> 24:32.791
Look out for Yuri.

24:32.860 --> 24:35.764
Seems he's got something planned
for you when this is done.

24:35.831 --> 24:37.500
This job just keeps getting
better and better.

24:37.568 --> 24:38.969
So how you want to play this?

24:39.037 --> 24:41.540
I don't know.
What do you think?

24:41.608 --> 24:43.310
I say we kill the rest of them.

24:43.377 --> 24:45.380
Sounds good to me.

24:49.689 --> 24:52.309
<i>Can we help you?</i>

24:57.434 --> 24:58.636
What the hell is going on?

24:58.704 --> 25:00.740
It's a little complicated.

25:00.808 --> 25:02.009
I know it doesn't seem like it,

25:02.043 --> 25:03.712
but I'm actually one
of the good guys.

25:03.779 --> 25:05.281
- Sorry.
- Sorry about what?

25:14.932 --> 25:15.933
Chicago, you there?

25:16.001 --> 25:17.402
Yeah.

25:17.470 --> 25:19.806
It's done.

25:19.874 --> 25:21.776
Beyond that gate
is security system.

25:21.844 --> 25:23.145
<i>You need to get in there
and disarm it.</i>

25:23.213 --> 25:24.681
Sounds like fun.

25:24.749 --> 25:25.983
How?

25:26.051 --> 25:28.621
<i>Through that vent.</i>

25:28.689 --> 25:31.927
How do you expect me
to fit in there?

25:33.464 --> 25:36.935
Strip down, oil up.

25:37.003 --> 25:38.839
I'm not going to look.

26:00.678 --> 26:02.313
We're in position.
Need the alarms off.

26:02.381 --> 26:03.515
How's it coming?

26:03.583 --> 26:04.818
Slowly.

26:04.885 --> 26:06.954
Your girlfriend
had too big a breakfast.

26:10.278 --> 26:11.563
This is pathetic.

26:42.350 --> 26:43.417
How's it going in here?

26:43.485 --> 26:44.987
Fine.
Where's Boise?

26:45.054 --> 26:48.527
Potty break.
Nervous on the job.

26:48.594 --> 26:51.482
London, how's security going?

26:51.566 --> 26:54.503
I just got to get to the panel,
so I can kill the lasers.

26:57.743 --> 27:00.313
What's going on in there?

27:00.381 --> 27:03.251
You try doing this
covered in oil.

27:28.930 --> 27:31.434
Security clear.

27:31.501 --> 27:32.936
That's my girl.

28:06.929 --> 28:07.947
Got to go, boys.

28:08.032 --> 28:09.466
Shape charge
should blow straight down,

28:09.534 --> 28:10.769
but it ain't a perfect world.

28:29.535 --> 28:31.604
Man, I'm good.

28:31.672 --> 28:34.743
Hey, stop staring.
Start digging.

28:37.349 --> 28:39.585
Nice job.

28:53.377 --> 28:56.347
Boise?

28:56.415 --> 28:57.983
Boise, did you hear that?

28:58.051 --> 28:59.536
Let's see.

28:59.620 --> 29:01.223
You're probably out of range.

29:01.290 --> 29:04.094
Let me change the frequency.

29:04.162 --> 29:05.263
No, wait.

29:05.331 --> 29:09.169
Put them in here.

29:09.237 --> 29:12.041
Ames!

29:12.109 --> 29:13.143
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

29:13.210 --> 29:14.145
<i>We got to get out of here.</i>

29:14.212 --> 29:15.614
They got a cleaner on the team.

29:15.681 --> 29:17.618
Unfortunately
not a very good one.

29:20.857 --> 29:23.327
I got the diamonds.
Let's go.
Not without him!

29:26.117 --> 29:27.935
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

29:28.003 --> 29:29.771
Let 'em kill each other.
He's the guy that I work for.

29:29.839 --> 29:31.775
I asked him to come.

29:36.517 --> 29:37.552
Chicago?

29:37.619 --> 29:39.288
I thought you were legit.

29:39.355 --> 29:41.892
I am! He's here to make sure
we both survive!

29:41.943 --> 29:43.528
I don't need his help.

29:43.597 --> 29:45.566
Is he gonna make us give
back the diamonds?

29:45.633 --> 29:47.068
Are you nuts?

29:47.136 --> 29:48.537
I didn't make that deal!

29:58.690 --> 30:00.358
<i>No, Brody, don't leave.</i>

30:00.426 --> 30:01.827
<i>No!</i>

30:01.895 --> 30:04.265
No, Brody, don't leave.
Markus will find you.

30:04.333 --> 30:05.801
He can protect us.
Trust me!

30:05.869 --> 30:07.470
I did.

30:07.538 --> 30:10.642
I always trusted you, Ames.

30:14.250 --> 30:15.784
- You okay?
- Yeah.

30:15.852 --> 30:17.521
You let him get away
with the diamonds.

30:17.588 --> 30:19.424
He thinks he did.

30:21.529 --> 30:22.663
Nice work, Ames.

30:22.731 --> 30:25.535
Markus won't be happy.

30:35.174 --> 30:37.093
<i>Markus is still out there,
and he's gonna be looking</i>

30:37.161 --> 30:38.281
for those, and then
he's gonna be looking for her.

30:38.382 --> 30:39.883
Well, he can find them
under lock and key

30:39.951 --> 30:41.051
back at the museum.

30:41.120 --> 30:43.222
Guards will be here momentarily
to pick them up.

30:43.290 --> 30:45.560
And as for her...

30:45.627 --> 30:46.728
<i>I'm glad she's safe,</i>

30:46.796 --> 30:48.398
<i>but I simply can't trust
her anymore.</i>

30:48.466 --> 30:49.934
She had a chance to walk away
with those diamonds,

30:50.001 --> 30:51.670
and she didn't take it...
Now, as far as I'm concerned,

30:51.737 --> 30:53.440
I got no problem with her.
- Well, I do.

30:53.508 --> 30:54.909
<i>No offense,</i>

30:54.977 --> 30:56.312
but the criminal-element
quotient

30:56.379 --> 30:58.348
is already high enough
around here.

30:58.416 --> 31:01.053
Perhaps it's time
to minimize our exposure.

31:07.165 --> 31:09.033
Brody, where are you?

31:09.101 --> 31:11.471
<i>Listen to me very carefully.</i>

31:11.539 --> 31:14.776
You don't bring me
what I want, he dies.

31:14.844 --> 31:17.865
You double-cross me,
and he dies.

31:17.949 --> 31:20.353
Come alone, or he dies.

31:20.420 --> 31:21.989
Where?

31:22.056 --> 31:24.860
Train station, now.

31:27.132 --> 31:29.202
Right, but it's not your back
that's being exposed

31:29.270 --> 31:30.671
out there in the field.

31:30.739 --> 31:32.891
It's mine, and I trust
that she's gonna watch it.

31:32.975 --> 31:35.679
I'm sorry, Mr. chance,
but it's not your call to make.
Really?

31:35.730 --> 31:37.081
I thought we were partners.

31:37.149 --> 31:38.384
Markus got Brody.

31:38.451 --> 31:40.388
<i>He wants the diamonds.</i>

31:40.455 --> 31:43.226
Or Brody dies.

31:45.130 --> 31:47.099
Look, I know that you want me
out of here, and that's cool.

31:47.167 --> 31:49.704
I-i get it.
I screwed up.

31:49.772 --> 31:53.076
But I need your help.

31:53.144 --> 31:54.478
Brody's an idiot, yeah.

31:54.546 --> 31:56.081
He... he makes
poor decisions.

31:56.149 --> 31:57.785
He's a degenerate thief,

31:57.852 --> 32:01.724
but he is the closest thing
that I have to family.

32:04.931 --> 32:07.233
Mrs. pucci...

32:07.301 --> 32:09.972
I don't know what else to say
except, "please."

32:14.013 --> 32:17.118
I'll do anything.

32:19.656 --> 32:24.430
You realize these diamonds
are worth nearly $50 million?

32:24.498 --> 32:27.869
A representative is
on his way to pick them up,

32:27.938 --> 32:30.540
and when he arrives...

32:30.608 --> 32:33.847
I'm going to tell him
the truth...

32:37.286 --> 32:39.223
That there's been
some confusion,

32:39.290 --> 32:42.228
and they're on their way
back to the museum.

32:42.295 --> 32:44.399
Make sure they reach
their destination

32:44.466 --> 32:46.635
and that you both return safely.

32:59.759 --> 33:01.161
Hello?

33:01.228 --> 33:02.830
<i>Locker number 468.</i>

33:02.898 --> 33:05.000
<i>Go there now.</i>
Where's Brody?

33:05.052 --> 33:06.570
<i>Show me you can follow orders,</i>

33:06.638 --> 33:08.807
<i>and I'll show you
your boyfriend.</i>

33:08.874 --> 33:13.315
She's headed to the lockers.

33:13.383 --> 33:14.400
Any sign of the kid?

33:14.485 --> 33:16.053
No, not yet.

33:16.121 --> 33:17.222
Where is he?

33:17.290 --> 33:19.358
Put the diamonds inside
and go back

33:19.426 --> 33:20.694
<i>to the main concourse.</i>

33:20.762 --> 33:23.232
<i>You'll see him
when I get what I want.</i>

33:23.300 --> 33:25.035
<i>Don't hang up.</i>

33:29.745 --> 33:31.546
Where is he?

33:31.597 --> 33:34.351
<i>Patience.</i>
She's made the drop.

33:35.821 --> 33:37.924
<i>We had a deal.
Where's Brody?</i>

33:37.992 --> 33:41.130
I said, "Patience."

33:50.947 --> 33:53.618
Thank you, my darling.

33:53.685 --> 33:55.154
<i>Thank you.</i>

33:58.561 --> 34:02.099
He's waiting for you outside
in the courtyard.

34:02.167 --> 34:03.769
He just gave up the location.

34:03.820 --> 34:05.605
<i>He must have the diamonds.</i>

34:14.254 --> 34:16.123
Damn!

34:16.192 --> 34:18.627
He's got 'em.
Locker's got a dummy back.

34:18.695 --> 34:20.648
He's probably headed
out to the loading dock.

34:20.732 --> 34:23.803
Brody!

34:27.177 --> 34:29.012
<i>Chance, help.
Brody's in trouble.</i>

34:29.080 --> 34:31.217
<i>Take Ames.
I got him from here.</i>

34:34.356 --> 34:37.226
No, no, no.
Stop! Stop!

34:39.966 --> 34:41.067
What is it?

34:41.134 --> 34:43.003
I'm booby-trapped.

34:43.071 --> 34:46.108
If I move, it blows.

34:58.665 --> 35:00.433
Hey, dude.

35:02.371 --> 35:04.574
Wrong way, pal.

35:08.448 --> 35:10.484
Chicago?

35:17.096 --> 35:19.199
How... how do
i get you out?

35:19.267 --> 35:22.872
You can't.

35:22.923 --> 35:25.143
I'm sitting
on a pressure switch.

35:25.210 --> 35:26.812
I'm gonna die.

35:26.880 --> 35:28.916
No, you're not.

35:28.984 --> 35:32.155
What's he doing here?

35:33.825 --> 35:35.978
I'm here to get you
out of this mess.

35:36.063 --> 35:38.900
You okay with that?

35:41.765 --> 35:43.668
So this is one
of your shape charges, right,

35:43.735 --> 35:46.071
except the blast
is aimed downward?
Yeah.

35:46.139 --> 35:48.676
The bounce-back
will vaporize the bench

35:48.743 --> 35:51.113
and me.

35:51.165 --> 35:52.683
Ames, you better get
out of here.

35:52.750 --> 35:53.985
I'm not leaving.

35:54.053 --> 35:56.490
He's right.
Get away.

35:56.557 --> 35:57.725
I don't want you to get hurt.

35:57.793 --> 35:59.828
He's right.
Come on, Ames, move.

35:59.896 --> 36:01.264
<i>What are you gonna do?</i>

36:01.315 --> 36:02.700
Something I should have done
a while ago,

36:02.767 --> 36:04.002
is knock this punk on his ass.

36:04.070 --> 36:06.073
Hey.

36:06.140 --> 36:07.542
Trust me.

36:11.216 --> 36:14.721
Got to trust him.

36:21.834 --> 36:22.835
Wait!
Chance!

36:22.869 --> 36:25.473
If you touch me, it'll blow!

36:26.943 --> 36:28.846
<i>No! No!</i>

36:33.755 --> 36:35.490
Move!

36:50.383 --> 36:53.822
Don't you ever not
trust me again.

36:53.890 --> 36:56.493
Dude...

36:56.561 --> 37:00.199
That was awesome.

37:00.250 --> 37:02.754
Huh?

37:02.838 --> 37:04.406
He said, "how'd you..."

37:04.458 --> 37:06.177
Oh.

37:06.244 --> 37:08.615
You okay?

37:08.682 --> 37:10.517
What?

37:27.581 --> 37:28.782
Where you gonna go now?

37:28.833 --> 37:30.284
I don't know.

37:30.352 --> 37:32.989
Figure I'd spin that globe
and see where it lands.

37:33.057 --> 37:34.726
What, you don't want
to stick around,

37:34.794 --> 37:36.962
join me in my legit life?

37:37.014 --> 37:39.000
It's not for me.

37:39.068 --> 37:40.136
Isn't it boring?

37:40.203 --> 37:42.205
Apparently not.

37:42.273 --> 37:44.743
Seriously...

37:44.811 --> 37:47.114
I could speak to the team.

37:47.182 --> 37:49.484
Sure they could use
the best demo guy in the world.

37:49.552 --> 37:53.525
Don't think punching
a clock is for me.

37:53.592 --> 37:56.564
There's only one thing
that would keep me here,

37:56.632 --> 37:59.068
and she seems
pretty well taken care of.

37:59.135 --> 38:01.372
It's early days.

38:01.440 --> 38:04.043
I don't even know
if I've still got a job.

38:04.111 --> 38:05.279
It's not the job.

38:05.346 --> 38:07.082
You found people
that really care about you.

38:07.149 --> 38:08.985
You deserve that.

38:09.053 --> 38:12.257
I love you, Ames.

38:12.325 --> 38:14.762
Watch your back.

38:14.830 --> 38:18.936
That's what I got you for.

38:19.003 --> 38:20.772
I got to go.

38:33.446 --> 38:34.529
Well, I'm relieved to say

38:34.597 --> 38:37.602
that the diamonds
have been returned safely.

38:37.669 --> 38:39.304
Perhaps they need
a bit of a buff,

38:39.372 --> 38:43.044
but I suppose they say
they're forever for a reason.

38:43.112 --> 38:45.916
Well done.

38:45.984 --> 38:49.321
You too, Mrs. pucci.

38:49.389 --> 38:52.126
Well...

38:52.194 --> 38:54.430
I should probably find
a cleaner to handle...

38:54.498 --> 38:56.500
Um, not a cleaner, I mean...

38:56.568 --> 38:57.669
<i>Oh.</i>

38:57.737 --> 39:00.641
I've still got a-a lot
to get used to here.

39:02.579 --> 39:03.613
Case in point.

39:03.681 --> 39:06.250
Dudes, check it out...

39:06.319 --> 39:09.423
A gift from Mr. Chicago.

39:09.491 --> 39:11.493
Apology for the condition
he left the Van in.

39:11.561 --> 39:14.632
I don't even want to know.

39:14.700 --> 39:15.700
<i>What'd he bring us?</i>

39:15.768 --> 39:17.337
40-year scotch.

39:17.405 --> 39:19.941
Classy move.
Was the right thing to do...

39:20.009 --> 39:23.714
<i>Considering.</i>

39:23.782 --> 39:26.719
Oh, that's good.

39:26.787 --> 39:28.656
Look at this place.

39:28.724 --> 39:32.028
Yeah, it looks a bit different
than it used to.

39:32.096 --> 39:33.364
Worse?

39:33.432 --> 39:36.503
Too early to tell.

39:36.571 --> 39:38.373
Well, gentlemen,
in my experience,

39:38.441 --> 39:40.409
whenever women
enter the picture...

39:40.477 --> 39:42.380
<i>Things tend to get
a little bit messy.</i>

39:42.448 --> 39:43.849
Hey.

39:43.900 --> 39:45.585
Speak of the devil.

39:45.653 --> 39:48.825
I know I'm no longer
an employee.

39:48.893 --> 39:52.899
I just wanted to stop by
and say thanks

39:52.966 --> 39:54.166
<i>to all of you.</i>

39:54.235 --> 39:56.037
Never really had anybody

39:56.105 --> 39:58.575
besides Brody
get my back like that.

39:58.643 --> 40:02.080
And I know I've already asked
for a second chance.

40:02.148 --> 40:03.851
Maybe this is the third, fourth?

40:03.919 --> 40:05.085
I don't know.
I'm a slow learner.

40:05.154 --> 40:06.756
And if you do give me another,

40:06.823 --> 40:09.126
<i>I am not gonna promise</i>

40:09.193 --> 40:11.931
<i>that I won't mess up again.</i>

40:11.999 --> 40:14.101
But I will watch your backs.

40:14.169 --> 40:16.272
It... it may not really
mean anything.

40:16.340 --> 40:18.309
If you do need me...

40:20.280 --> 40:23.251
I'll be there.

40:23.319 --> 40:25.154
Okay.

40:25.221 --> 40:27.224
Well...

40:27.292 --> 40:30.063
That's all, folks.

40:30.130 --> 40:31.832
<i>You got the number.</i>

40:31.900 --> 40:34.103
See ya.

40:34.171 --> 40:36.273
You drink scotch?

40:36.341 --> 40:38.077
Dude, this is the good stuff.

40:38.144 --> 40:39.846
That's all I drink.

40:39.914 --> 40:43.018
Have a seat.

40:45.790 --> 40:48.094
Well, hello, Ames.

40:50.231 --> 40:54.004
You don't listen
to a word I say.

40:54.071 --> 40:57.009
You're not very forthcoming,
and you're an inveterate liar.

40:59.848 --> 41:02.786
But I suppose those aren't
very important assets

41:02.854 --> 41:05.323
in this line of work.

41:08.530 --> 41:11.200
But what you are is loyal,

41:11.268 --> 41:15.875
and I'll take that over
the others any day of the week.

41:15.942 --> 41:17.344
Welcome back.

41:17.412 --> 41:19.181
Thanks.

41:22.454 --> 41:25.993
<i>You know, if you'd have said
to me a few years back</i>

41:26.061 --> 41:28.563
that I'd be working straight,
I'd have thought you were crazy.

41:28.631 --> 41:31.552
If you had told me ten years ago
I'd be drinking with you

41:31.637 --> 41:33.078
and the rest
of these crooks in here,

41:33.139 --> 41:34.774
I'd have had you committed.

41:34.842 --> 41:37.045
Tell me about it.

41:37.096 --> 41:39.348
Will someone pour me a drink.

41:41.287 --> 41:42.788
There goes the good stuff.

41:48.499 --> 41:49.834
Partner.

41:50.305 --> 41:56.673
