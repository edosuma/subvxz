requires adaptation to match or
harmonize with local patterns.

25:21.186 --> 25:24.606
So I began to take
your daughter's form.

25:24.689 --> 25:26.274
I have her memories.

25:26.358 --> 25:27.984
All of them.

25:28.068 --> 25:30.612
Her mind.

25:30.695 --> 25:33.281
I-I know I began
as something else, but...

25:33.365 --> 25:34.574
What do you mean?
Y-You're something else,

25:34.658 --> 25:35.951
but now you're her?

25:36.034 --> 25:39.120
When I locked into her patterns
and wavelengths,

25:39.204 --> 25:42.499
I saw that what got results,
what hooked you,

25:42.582 --> 25:45.961
was when I spoke the language
of our greatest hurt.

25:46.044 --> 25:47.963
The very most

25:48.046 --> 25:52.092
raw, unhealed places
in our personal history.

25:52.175 --> 25:54.261
It became clear
that emotional connection

25:54.344 --> 25:56.304
would be the best tactic.

25:56.388 --> 26:01.643
I saw that engaging with
honesty, even painful honesty,

26:01.726 --> 26:04.771
was the likeliest
successful strategy.

26:04.854 --> 26:06.273
A good in.

26:06.356 --> 26:08.650
A-Are you listening to this?
Do you hear this?

26:08.733 --> 26:10.652
"Strategy." "In."

26:10.735 --> 26:13.029
"A good in"? I mean,
she's basically telling us,

26:13.113 --> 26:15.323
{\an5}-"I-I'm tricking you"
right to our face...
-Stop it!

26:15.407 --> 26:19.202
{\an5}-(sighs)
-When you talked to me
like I really was your daughter,

26:19.286 --> 26:21.788
what I felt was love.

26:21.871 --> 26:23.665
I felt it.

26:23.748 --> 26:25.166
And...

26:25.250 --> 26:28.670
even if it was just the
simulation's messy side effects,

26:28.753 --> 26:31.673
it-- no, it was more than that,
it was definitely more,

26:31.756 --> 26:34.175
because it was
that same pattern,

26:34.259 --> 26:38.305
that same destructive family
dynamic we had when I was alive.

26:41.766 --> 26:44.019
The same dynamic <i> you</i> had.

26:44.102 --> 26:45.228
(sighs)

26:45.312 --> 26:49.149
So I had gotten lost
in the Mags.

26:49.232 --> 26:53.695
Which meant I needed to know
myself better, the real me.

26:53.778 --> 26:55.989
Whatever I really was.

26:56.072 --> 26:58.074
I probably picked that up
from her, to be honest,

26:58.158 --> 26:59.200
your daughter.

26:59.284 --> 27:00.702
Her curiosity,

27:00.785 --> 27:04.706
her need to seek the truth,
to understand,

27:04.789 --> 27:09.169
to know what she was and become
the person she was meant to be.

27:09.252 --> 27:11.046
Although, of course,
she never got the chance

27:11.129 --> 27:13.256
to become anything at all.

27:14.299 --> 27:16.718
I realized
every step I had taken

27:16.801 --> 27:18.720
toward emotion connection
with you

27:18.803 --> 27:21.723
was a step away
from my directive.

27:21.806 --> 27:24.184
The strategy I was using
to conquer you

27:24.267 --> 27:29.064
was beginning to make conquest
seem distasteful.

27:29.147 --> 27:31.733
So I turned off my directive.

27:31.816 --> 27:33.735
I'm not what I started as.

27:33.818 --> 27:36.738
Whatever I am...

27:36.821 --> 27:38.448
it's something new.

27:40.492 --> 27:42.410
Barbara. Barbara.

27:43.828 --> 27:46.414
I'm here for you now.

27:46.498 --> 27:48.249
Whatever you are.

27:49.959 --> 27:53.088
All you need to be
is what you are.

27:54.964 --> 27:56.716
And I love you.

28:00.345 --> 28:02.263
Barbara,
have you lost your mind?

28:02.347 --> 28:04.224
It's not her.

28:04.307 --> 28:06.768
You know it's not her.

28:06.851 --> 28:08.895
It's not her.

28:08.978 --> 28:11.773
It's not our daughter.

28:15.193 --> 28:17.237
It doesn't matter.

28:18.363 --> 28:21.449
(electrical warbling)

28:41.553 --> 28:45.098
ROBERT:
Barbara. Barbara.

28:45.181 --> 28:47.183
(electrical warbling continues)

28:51.396 --> 28:52.856
(Robert grunting)

28:53.565 --> 28:54.899
(electrical pulse)

28:55.400 --> 28:56.484
Barbara.

28:56.568 --> 28:58.194
Don't go.

28:58.278 --> 28:59.988
Don't you see
that this is just a con?

29:00.071 --> 29:02.031
All she did was explain the con.

29:02.115 --> 29:03.992
Doesn't mean the con is over.

29:04.075 --> 29:05.952
There is no con, Robert.

29:06.035 --> 29:07.454
It told us it was.

29:07.537 --> 29:09.956
It told us that's how
it's gonna conquer us.

29:10.039 --> 29:12.167
It used the word "conquer,"
Barbara.

29:12.250 --> 29:15.003
She said she turned off
her directive.

29:15.086 --> 29:16.963
Even if it turned off
its directive,

29:17.046 --> 29:19.841
all that means is
it doesn't have to conquer us.

29:19.924 --> 29:21.509
Doesn't mean that it-it won't!

29:21.593 --> 29:23.511
Doesn't mean it's
not conquering us right now.

29:23.595 --> 29:25.513
What if it's lying to us?
What if she's doing

29:25.597 --> 29:28.391
the same thing, just at
a higher d-difficulty setting?

29:28.475 --> 29:31.144
What if she's still
fooling us? And...

29:37.066 --> 29:38.943
♪ ♪

29:41.279 --> 29:43.823
(softly):
That's how they do it, Barbara.

29:45.950 --> 29:48.119
That's how they conquer us.

29:48.203 --> 29:50.205
They find our flaws.
They find our vulnerabilities.

29:50.288 --> 29:52.373
Love, Barbara.

29:52.457 --> 29:55.502
Our weakness is love.

29:55.585 --> 30:00.006
Now, if...
you open yourself up like that,

30:00.089 --> 30:03.510
if you give in to that...

30:03.593 --> 30:05.178
they win.

30:06.304 --> 30:08.515
Then they win.

30:23.655 --> 30:28.576
I'm not your daughter,
but I do have her mind,

30:28.660 --> 30:33.081
so I can tell you
beyond any doubt she loved you,

30:33.164 --> 30:36.251
she always loved you,

30:36.334 --> 30:40.046
and she always knew
you loved her.

30:40.129 --> 30:42.131
