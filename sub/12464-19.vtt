- wha-- ah-ah.

00:10.643 --> 00:14.546
Did you three just escape
from a shallow grave?

00:15.815 --> 00:18.450
South is gonna
be here any minute!

00:18.452 --> 00:22.755
South salamanca
was my co-star on...
♪ "sing it loud!"

00:22.757 --> 00:24.490
I would've been lost
in l.A. Without her.

00:24.492 --> 00:26.759
( laughs )
I mean she was
like my family,

00:26.761 --> 00:29.228
Except I wasn't embarrassed
to be seen with her.

00:30.430 --> 00:33.732
Ugh!  Okay, you all need
to change.  You reek!

00:33.734 --> 00:35.934
Well, we had
to mulch the roses.

00:35.936 --> 00:38.437
You know me and my roses--
I just care too mulch.

00:38.439 --> 00:40.572
( laughs )
I love it.

00:40.574 --> 00:43.842
- Hey.
- ( gasps ) oh, maddie, no.

00:44.878 --> 00:47.246
Okay, I guess I am
the only one in this family

00:47.248 --> 00:50.282
Who cares about making
a good impression
on our guest.

00:50.284 --> 00:51.950
Not so fast!

00:55.922 --> 00:58.590
Looks like somebody
has a crush on south.

00:58.592 --> 01:01.393
America has
a crush on south.

01:01.395 --> 01:03.629
I'm the guy
who has a shot.

01:06.499 --> 01:10.002
So, are you
as excited about seeing
my l.A. B.F.F. As I am?

01:10.004 --> 01:13.739
- ( squeaks )
- actually, south can
be a bit much.

01:17.677 --> 01:19.511

01:19.513 --> 01:23.282
There's my
b.F.F.W.L.I.W.N.!

01:23.284 --> 01:27.920
- I'm sorry, what?
- Both: Best friend forever
who lives in wisconsin now.

01:28.988 --> 01:31.790
Mr. And mrs. Rooney,
great house.

01:31.792 --> 01:34.560
- You don't even know.
- Well, actually, south,
we live here,

01:34.562 --> 01:36.395
So we-- we do know.

01:36.397 --> 01:38.697
No. No, you don't.

01:38.699 --> 01:42.034
I'm from hollywood.
I see beauty more clearly.

01:43.002 --> 01:45.437
I see beauty
very clearly,

01:45.439 --> 01:47.039
Standing right
in my living room.

01:48.842 --> 01:52.644
A rose to thank you
for the hours of joy
I get watching your show.

01:52.646 --> 01:55.914
You watch "raise the roof"?
So sweet.

01:55.916 --> 01:58.984
But don't get
your hopes up.
I'm 16.

01:58.986 --> 02:02.488
'cause you don't look
a day over gorgeous.

02:02.490 --> 02:03.989

Class of '89 reunion's
this Saturday night.

03:05.553 --> 03:07.619
Sign up here to volunteer.

03:07.621 --> 03:10.422
Don't make me
use my whistle.

03:12.559 --> 03:14.993
I am so excited
for your reunion.

03:14.995 --> 03:16.695
Thank you, honey.

03:16.697 --> 03:20.365
You know, I was kind of
a big deal in high school.

03:20.367 --> 03:22.701
So things might
get a little crazy town

03:22.703 --> 03:25.037
When prime-time
pete rooney rolls in.

03:25.039 --> 03:28.040
Okay. I'm a longtime
resident of crazy town,

03:28.042 --> 03:29.775
So I think
I'll be okay, prime-time.

03:32.111 --> 03:35.747
It's time to put
the brain olympics trophy
in the school's case.

03:35.749 --> 03:38.717
Joint custody just--
it isn't working out, artie.

03:38.719 --> 03:40.085
I'm happy to keep it
at the school

03:40.087 --> 03:42.054
If it prevents you
from eating cereal
out of it.

03:43.656 --> 03:45.524
I only did that once,

03:45.526 --> 03:47.793
And it tasted
like victory...

03:49.028 --> 03:50.729
With raisins.

03:51.965 --> 03:53.732
( rattling )

03:53.734 --> 03:56.969
( taps )
dang it, case won't open.

03:56.971 --> 03:58.503
Guess I'll have to
keep it at my house.

03:58.505 --> 04:00.105
( chuckles )

04:04.510 --> 04:05.944
Nice try.

04:05.946 --> 04:09.548
- ( whirs, clangs )
- ( gasps )

04:12.085 --> 04:13.785
What is that?

04:17.824 --> 04:19.791
It's beautiful...

04:20.727 --> 04:22.628
And unexpectedly sticky.

04:24.931 --> 04:27.766
"you hold in your hand
the porcupine prism,

04:27.768 --> 04:29.835
Which will lead you to..."
( gasps )

04:29.837 --> 04:32.137
"the key of power."

04:32.139 --> 04:34.439
According to ridgewood lore,

04:34.441 --> 04:37.776
The key of power
unlocks locker c-23.

04:37.778 --> 04:40.012
Legend states
that visionary math geeks

04:40.014 --> 04:42.481
Created the key in 1989,

04:42.483 --> 04:46.018
Then hid it where
it could only be found
by the chosen one.

04:46.020 --> 04:48.487
Both:
I am the chosen one.

04:50.123 --> 04:52.190
We have to get
into locker c-23.

04:52.192 --> 04:54.626
The scroll says
the prism will guide us

04:54.628 --> 04:56.662
To the key of power
on the first night

04:56.664 --> 04:59.931
Of the first month
in the year of the snake.

04:59.933 --> 05:03.001
Wait!
That's this Saturday!

05:03.003 --> 05:06.571
How do we get into school
on a Saturday night?

05:06.573 --> 05:11.510
Saturday night!
Sign up for your own
coach rooney's 25th reunion.

05:12.478 --> 05:13.745
Wait wait wait wait wait!

05:13.747 --> 05:16.148
I would like to volunteer
for my dad's reunion.

05:16.150 --> 05:18.517
Not before I can volunteer
for my mom's reunion.

05:19.819 --> 05:22.187
Well, thank you, boys.

05:22.989 --> 05:25.123
No, thank you, father.

05:25.125 --> 05:28.493
See you
Saturday night, wad-bag.

05:30.196 --> 05:33.065
And... Next period.

05:37.270 --> 05:39.237
So there we are, shooting
the tropical episode of...

05:39.239 --> 05:41.039
♪ "sing it loud!"

05:41.041 --> 05:43.275
And the whole cast of...

05:43.277 --> 05:47.079
♪ "sing it lou-oud!"

05:47.081 --> 05:48.914
Was shipwrecked.

05:49.849 --> 05:52.117
Yeah, but then--
oh, but then

05:52.119 --> 05:54.052
We heard the monkeys singing
the theme song to...

05:54.054 --> 06:00.892
♪ "sing it
lou-ou-oud!" oh. ♪

06:02.028 --> 06:04.129
( laughs )
it was like totes hilar.

06:05.098 --> 06:07.933
That show is
so five minutes ago.

06:09.135 --> 06:10.869
Let's talk about
your new show, south.

06:10.871 --> 06:12.804
( laughs )
oh, you mean...

06:12.806 --> 06:20.145
♪ "rai-ai-I-I-I-se
the roof"? ♪

06:20.147 --> 06:22.914
( softly )
♪ roof.

06:24.117 --> 06:26.685
"raise the roof" is
about four lady carpenters

06:26.687 --> 06:29.154
Who build houses by day
and sing by night,

06:29.156 --> 06:30.989
But still find time
to solve crimes

06:30.991 --> 06:32.591
And compete
in beauty pageants.

06:32.593 --> 06:34.292
I don't know
how they do it!

06:39.165 --> 06:41.166
- Hey, you.
- Hey, you, back.

06:42.101 --> 06:43.568
People!  People.

06:45.738 --> 06:48.106
Diggie and I recently decided
that we're "in like,"

06:48.108 --> 06:50.142
But we're just
keeping it on the d.L.

06:50.144 --> 06:54.713
I'm in like.
I want the world to know.

06:54.715 --> 06:56.214
I know it, he knows it.

06:56.216 --> 06:59.084
- And we like it that way.
- I hate it this way!

07:00.920 --> 07:05.056
Um, so you are about
to meet liv's best friend,
south salamanca.

07:05.058 --> 07:06.825
You're probably
not gonna like her,
but just do me a favor.

07:06.827 --> 07:10.095
I'd do anything
for the girl I "like."

07:11.097 --> 07:13.899
( laughs, snorts )

07:15.868 --> 07:17.969
Yeah, so just--

07:17.971 --> 07:19.137
When we go in,
just be nice to her.

07:19.139 --> 07:21.740
Sure.
I like doing favors

07:21.742 --> 07:23.942
For people I "like."

07:23.944 --> 07:25.076
( laughs )

07:25.078 --> 07:26.378
Okay, one hug,

07:26.380 --> 07:28.780
But just because you're
really cute right now.

07:28.782 --> 07:29.881
( gasps ) person!

07:31.117 --> 07:34.286
Oh.  No, that was--
that was just a lamppost.

07:38.057 --> 07:40.025
Yeah, so there she is.

07:40.027 --> 07:42.160
Prepare to be ignored,
'cause she really only
listens to liv.

07:43.663 --> 07:46.865
( laughs )
and what is
all this yum-yum soup?

07:49.268 --> 07:54.272
( chuckles )
so, diggie, this is
south salamanca.

07:54.274 --> 07:56.741
Hi, nice to meet you.
I love your show.

07:56.743 --> 07:59.044
( laughs )
you watch my show?

07:59.046 --> 08:01.079
You watch her show?

08:02.181 --> 08:03.748
It's really cool
to meet you in person.

08:03.750 --> 08:05.784
Well, it's cool
to be met.

08:05.786 --> 08:08.153
You don't even know.

08:09.789 --> 08:12.224
Wow.  What gorgeous
brown eyes.

08:12.226 --> 08:16.161
Thanks.  My mom calls them
her little chocolate chips.

08:16.163 --> 08:19.097
( giggles )

08:20.066 --> 08:21.266
What are you
drinking there, punch?

08:21.268 --> 08:23.134
Let me freshen that up.

08:26.339 --> 08:30.108
Wow.  I was not expecting
that in wisconsin.

08:30.110 --> 08:33.745
10,000 cows and one
good-looking side of beef.

08:38.351 --> 08:41.152
- Oh.
- Karen, uh, wait.

08:41.154 --> 08:43.955
I just wanted
to tell you that

08:43.957 --> 08:45.757
Amy becker is gonna
be here tonight.

08:45.759 --> 08:49.027
She and prime-time
were kind of a thing.

08:49.029 --> 08:52.998
- I don't want
you to be jealous.
- Oh, mama don't get jelly.

08:54.867 --> 08:56.434
So you're not gonna
chomp ice all night

08:56.436 --> 08:57.903
Like you do
when you get nervous?

08:57.905 --> 08:59.938
Mama also
don't get nervy.

09:01.107 --> 09:03.341
And you're gonna
speak normally

09:03.343 --> 09:05.176
In front of my friends?
Right?

09:05.178 --> 09:07.078
Mama might.

Amy, amy!

10:11.545 --> 10:13.378
So good
to see you again.

10:13.380 --> 10:16.247
- Petey.
- Both: Oh!

10:16.249 --> 10:19.084
How do you still
look so good?

10:19.086 --> 10:22.287
- ( laughs )
- I thought I was
a swimsuit model.

10:22.289 --> 10:25.123
( voice breaks )
you're a swimsuit model?

10:25.125 --> 10:27.192
That just put me
through med school.

10:27.194 --> 10:30.061
Oh.  Swimsuit model,

10:30.063 --> 10:31.963
Doctor.
( laughs )

10:31.965 --> 10:33.932
Good for you.
Good for you.

10:34.900 --> 10:36.301
( crunching )

10:41.207 --> 10:43.842
So, you're on
the basketball team.

10:43.844 --> 10:46.578
Uh, actually,
I'm the captain.

10:46.580 --> 10:50.181
Well, aye aye, captain.

10:50.183 --> 10:52.484
( both laugh )

10:56.889 --> 10:58.456
Okay, how upset
would you be

10:58.458 --> 11:00.925
If I threw south so far
she became north?

11:02.528 --> 11:05.196
- Sorry, what?
- She's all up on diggie

11:05.198 --> 11:07.265
And she needs to not be.

11:07.267 --> 11:10.168
Okay, well then, maddie,
just talk to her.

11:10.170 --> 11:12.337
I mean, all you
have to do is say that
he's your boyfriend.

11:12.339 --> 11:16.207
Okay, say it with me:
Boy-friend.

11:18.010 --> 11:20.278
Diggie and I don't
play fast and loose
with language like that.

11:20.280 --> 11:22.247
( scoffs )
listen to yourself!

11:22.249 --> 11:24.149
No wonder south thinks
he's available.

11:24.151 --> 11:26.117
Okay, well,
can't you talk to her

11:26.119 --> 11:29.354
I mean, she listens to you.
You once talked her

11:29.356 --> 11:30.522
Into wearing
a parrot as a hat

11:30.524 --> 11:32.257
To the "sing it loud"
premiere.

11:33.292 --> 11:34.325
Yeah, I didn't
want her wearing

11:34.327 --> 11:36.127
The same bird as me.

11:37.196 --> 11:38.496
So you'll talk
to her and tell her

11:38.498 --> 11:42.367
To stay away
from my... Friend boy?

11:42.369 --> 11:45.003
"friend boy"?
Okay, maddie,

11:45.005 --> 11:47.372
South is not
the problem here.
You are.

11:47.374 --> 11:50.041
I mean, it's as clear
as my skin after a facial.

11:50.043 --> 11:51.476
Or anytime, really.

11:54.180 --> 11:56.214
Fine, I'll talk to her.

11:56.216 --> 11:58.917
By the way, your face is
really blotchy right now.

12:06.459 --> 12:09.461
The instructions say
to place the prism on top
of a janitor's mop

12:09.463 --> 12:12.030
Right here and wait
for the moonglow to hit it.

12:12.032 --> 12:14.599
Well then, we wait.

12:14.601 --> 12:17.969
I spy with my little eye...

12:17.971 --> 12:19.437
- Something--
- the prism.

12:19.439 --> 12:22.974
Mmm!  I knew
that was too obvious.

12:22.976 --> 12:24.442
No!  Look, the prism!

12:32.151 --> 12:34.619
( hisses )

12:34.621 --> 12:37.122
( shrieking )

12:37.124 --> 12:38.523
I knew it.
I knew it.

12:38.525 --> 12:40.658
It worked, it worked,
it worked!  Ugh!

12:43.129 --> 12:45.997
I spy
with my little eye...

12:47.233 --> 12:50.935
The key of power.

12:50.937 --> 12:53.104
It is mine!
I alone will unearth

12:53.106 --> 12:55.240
The secrets
of locker c-23!

12:56.275 --> 12:58.076
Is that liv holding

12:58.078 --> 13:01.045
A "go to prom with me,
artie" sign?

13:01.047 --> 13:03.381
- Oh!
- Oh, I know she's not there,

13:03.383 --> 13:05.250
But still I must turn!

13:10.422 --> 13:13.024
- Diggie: Two, three, four.
- Both: ♪ what you gonna do

13:13.026 --> 13:17.262
♪ and what you gonna do when
the world is a-rumbling? ♪

13:17.264 --> 13:19.664
♪ what you gonna do
when you're looking
for the truth? ♪

13:19.666 --> 13:22.433
♪ time to put down your tools,
pick up your mice ♪

13:22.435 --> 13:26.538
♪ and rai-aise the roof!

13:26.540 --> 13:29.541
( cheers, applause )

13:29.543 --> 13:31.176
What?

13:32.111 --> 13:33.611
Maddie told me
to be nice to south,

13:33.613 --> 13:35.613
So I've been hanging out
with her all night.

13:35.615 --> 13:39.083
Who's racking up
major brownie points
with his lady?

13:39.085 --> 13:41.219
This guy.

13:41.221 --> 13:42.720
( both laugh )

13:42.722 --> 13:44.522
- South!
- Hmm?

13:44.524 --> 13:46.691
Can I... Talk
to you for a second?

13:46.693 --> 13:49.694
Sure thing.
Keep my step warm.

13:51.530 --> 13:53.598
- ( guitar music playing )
- ( bangs )

13:58.137 --> 14:00.371
I see what
you're doing, my man.

14:00.373 --> 14:02.440
Game recognizes game.

14:04.610 --> 14:07.111
Why were you in there?

14:07.113 --> 14:09.214
Because I wouldn't
have your attention

14:09.216 --> 14:12.350
If I had just
walked up the stairs,
now would I?

14:14.220 --> 14:18.122
Stay away from south.
My sister might have
a crush on you,

14:18.124 --> 14:20.291
But I will crush you!

14:21.227 --> 14:23.061
Hey, so...
( laughs  )

14:23.063 --> 14:24.429
I just want to talk
to you about diggie.

14:24.431 --> 14:26.264
Oh, let me start.

14:26.266 --> 14:28.700
He is good-looking
and he can sing.

14:28.702 --> 14:32.036
You don't even know.
I don't even know.

14:32.038 --> 14:36.207
( forced laugh )
yeah, so listen,

14:36.209 --> 14:38.610
He's kind of--
it's like--

14:38.612 --> 14:41.446
He's-- well, I mean,
you know, he's, like--

14:41.448 --> 14:43.615
He's sort of--
it's mostly--

14:43.617 --> 14:46.517
So, uh, yeah.

14:46.519 --> 14:50.321
Ha!  Nailed that.

14:50.323 --> 14:53.825
So does he have
a girlfriend?
( laughs )

14:53.827 --> 14:57.262
Mmm, failed that.

14:57.264 --> 15:01.232
Oh!  Does diggie have
a girlfriend?

15:01.234 --> 15:02.734
Wow.  Interesting.

15:02.736 --> 15:07.071
Um, that's a really charged

15:07.073 --> 15:08.640
And labelly word, you know?

15:08.642 --> 15:11.342
You don't even know
what I know,

15:11.344 --> 15:15.079
He is "c" to the "u"...
( snapping fingers )

15:15.081 --> 15:16.714
To the "t-e," cute!

15:18.250 --> 15:19.250
Mm-hmm.

15:20.319 --> 15:22.120
She's right.
He is cute.

15:22.122 --> 15:23.755
Be a shame if something

15:23.757 --> 15:26.291
Were to happen to him.
( cracks knuckles )

15:32.131 --> 15:34.232
So, are you ready
to see me open

15:34.234 --> 15:38.102
Locker c-23
with the key of power?

15:38.104 --> 15:39.570
Never underestimate
a ginger!

15:39.572 --> 15:41.005
We have paprika
in our blood!

15:44.810 --> 15:46.611
( crunching )

15:48.180 --> 15:50.882
Hey, mom, you okay?

15:51.850 --> 15:53.117
Oh, I'm fine.

15:55.721 --> 15:57.822
Mom, come on.

15:57.824 --> 16:01.192
I know that look.
I've worn that look.

16:01.194 --> 16:04.262
- What's wrong?
- I'm just sitting here,

16:04.264 --> 16:08.299
Wondering how
I'm supposed to measure up
to a supermodel/doctor.

16:08.301 --> 16:10.702
Yeah, I saw her.

16:10.704 --> 16:12.437
Nice work, dad.

16:14.406 --> 16:16.407
But...
( chuckles )

16:16.409 --> 16:18.910
You are
a few things she's not.

16:18.912 --> 16:21.379
You're funny and smart

16:21.381 --> 16:23.414
And pretty darn cool.

16:24.383 --> 16:26.718
Thank you, honey.
( chuckles )

16:26.720 --> 16:28.653
What else am I?

16:29.722 --> 16:32.190
A little needy
right now.

16:33.926 --> 16:36.427
But you're also
a great mom.

16:36.429 --> 16:38.296
That's very sweet.

16:38.298 --> 16:39.597
There's one other thing:

16:39.599 --> 16:42.433
Dad married you.

16:43.936 --> 16:45.636
Well, he did,
didn't he?

16:45.638 --> 16:47.739
He could've married
christie brinkley in there

16:47.741 --> 16:50.475
And instead he chose
carol burnett.

16:51.643 --> 16:54.545
I have no idea who
either of those people are.

16:56.215 --> 16:58.282
But if it makes you happy,
go with it.

16:59.752 --> 17:03.321
( artie shouts )
tell your mommy
you wuv her!

17:04.256 --> 17:05.790
Artie.

17:05.792 --> 17:07.859
<i>( rock music playing )</i>

17:08.827 --> 17:10.361
( sighs )

17:10.363 --> 17:11.796
Oh, there you are.

17:11.798 --> 17:12.930
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

17:12.932 --> 17:14.932
You've been
chomping ice all night.

17:14.934 --> 17:17.635
( laughs )
I just needed a minute,

17:17.637 --> 17:18.936
- But I'm better than ever.
- Okay.

17:18.938 --> 17:22.306
May I present
for their throwback dance,

17:22.308 --> 17:23.941
Our prom king and queen

17:23.943 --> 17:26.944
Pete rooney
and amy becker!

17:26.946 --> 17:29.213
<i>( soft rock music playing )</i>

17:49.635 --> 17:51.702
( crunching )

17:56.809 --> 17:58.943
Oh no, I'm too late!

17:58.945 --> 18:01.712
I'm afraid so, joey,
but you've got a good view

18:01.714 --> 18:04.315
As I meet my destiny.
( chuckles )

18:04.317 --> 18:06.284
( grunts )

18:07.252 --> 18:09.320
( gasps, laughs )

18:09.322 --> 18:11.722
Did not see that coming.

18:11.724 --> 18:14.425
My inability
to take the stairs
in a timely fashion

18:14.427 --> 18:16.260
Has saved me once again.

18:17.596 --> 18:20.431
And now,
my destiny awaits.

18:20.433 --> 18:23.034
( grunts )

18:23.036 --> 18:26.471
( laughter )

18:26.473 --> 18:28.573
It worked!

18:28.575 --> 18:31.275
Class of '89 burn!

18:32.044 --> 18:33.578
Mom?

18:36.548 --> 18:39.617
We got my own kid!

18:39.619 --> 18:42.286
How funny is that?

18:42.288 --> 18:44.489
Artie, is this
that nice boy joey

18:44.491 --> 18:47.825
You're always
going on and on about?

18:47.827 --> 18:49.961
I do not!
Quit talking, mom.

18:49.963 --> 18:51.462
( laughter continues )

18:51.464 --> 18:53.898
Did your mommy just say

18:53.900 --> 18:55.633
You wuv me?

18:56.835 --> 18:59.837
Come on, gang,
let's go pants
principal fickman.

19:03.675 --> 19:05.943
South didn't get it
when I told her to leave
diggie alone.

19:05.945 --> 19:09.981
Who was conveniently
off looking for vegan fudge.

19:09.983 --> 19:12.617
This was the perfect
swap-portunity.

19:12.619 --> 19:15.853
Now I know that's a liv word,
but I'm just getting
into character.

19:18.757 --> 19:20.725
You guys are
still there, right?

19:33.639 --> 19:36.340
( clears throat ) hey.

19:36.342 --> 19:37.909
( mimicking liv,
laughing )
hey.  Hey.

19:39.411 --> 19:43.514
Hey, south.
It's your b.F.F.Q.Y.Z., liv.

19:44.716 --> 19:48.653
- What does that mean?
- Your best friend forever

19:48.655 --> 19:50.988
Quail... Yak zoo.

19:50.990 --> 19:52.657
So anyway,

19:52.659 --> 19:55.927
I just wanted to say
maybe you should back up
off diggie

19:55.929 --> 19:57.929
Like nowsies.
Okaysies?

20:01.099 --> 20:03.034
What are you doing,
rooney?

20:03.036 --> 20:04.902
( laughs )

20:04.904 --> 20:07.872
That's me, rooney.
Liv rooney.

20:11.410 --> 20:12.977
Okay.

20:14.379 --> 20:17.081
So I was
just telling south

20:17.083 --> 20:20.117
That she should maybe,
like, back up off you.

20:21.086 --> 20:22.720
What, you mean
she was flirting with me?

20:22.722 --> 20:25.856
( scoffs )
are you dead?

20:27.826 --> 20:31.028
And what's the big deal?
Do you have a girlfriend
or something?

20:32.531 --> 20:34.932
I think
I'll let liv answer that.

20:34.934 --> 20:36.701
Liv.

20:37.836 --> 20:38.869
( door closes )

20:38.871 --> 20:40.538
Yeah.

20:40.540 --> 20:43.174
Answer the question, liv.

20:44.543 --> 20:46.877
Whoa.  Two livs?

20:46.879 --> 20:48.412
Does maddie know
about her?

20:50.048 --> 20:51.949
( laughs )
please.  Two livs?

20:51.951 --> 20:54.418
Like I would
ever wear this outfit.

20:54.420 --> 20:55.853
( normal voice )
okay, now that you're here,

20:55.855 --> 20:57.054
Can you... ( whsipers )
please talk to her?

20:57.056 --> 20:59.090
No.  Maddie,

20:59.092 --> 21:01.592
This is ridiculous.
Okay, you know what?

21:01.594 --> 21:03.127
I am gonna put this
in terms that

21:03.129 --> 21:04.495
- You can understand.  Ready?
- Uh-huh.

21:04.497 --> 21:06.998
It's time to step up
to the hoop

21:07.000 --> 21:11.836
And swing for the...
Sports thing.

21:15.841 --> 21:17.141
Can you just say it?

21:18.577 --> 21:20.444
Okay. ( chuckling )

21:26.618 --> 21:31.522
Um, diggie is my...

21:34.960 --> 21:36.661
Boyfriend.
( exhales sharply )

21:39.131 --> 21:40.798
- Yes.
- ( maddie chuckles )

21:40.800 --> 21:42.099
Finally!

21:43.969 --> 21:46.103
Hear that, everybody?

21:46.105 --> 21:47.538
Maddie rooney...

21:47.540 --> 21:49.807
( shouts )
is my girlfriend!

21:53.578 --> 21:56.147
Maddie rooney's
my girlfriend!

21:57.249 --> 21:58.716
( chuckles )

21:58.718 --> 22:01.686
( shouts )
maddie rooney's my girlfriend!

22:04.089 --> 22:06.757
Okay, so when I pictured
that moment in my head,

22:06.759 --> 22:09.493
He wasn't
running away screaming.

22:09.495 --> 22:11.762
( laughing )
but you did it.

22:11.764 --> 22:13.798
I'm so proud
of you, mads.

22:13.800 --> 22:15.499
Now please
take this off.

22:15.501 --> 22:17.568
Yeah, way to go.

22:17.570 --> 22:19.036
Diggie is a total score.

22:19.038 --> 22:21.138
And no damage--

22:21.140 --> 22:23.074
There's tons of other fish
in the sea for me.

22:24.009 --> 22:25.843
How about a guppy?

22:29.014 --> 22:30.614
Care to join me
in the moonlight

22:30.616 --> 22:32.149
For a juice box, doll?

22:33.118 --> 22:36.153
Sure, why not?
( chuckles )

22:36.155 --> 22:39.123
So, you really
a fan of my show?

22:39.125 --> 22:40.558
Oh, you don't even...
♪ know!

22:48.233 --> 22:51.736
- Hey, man.
- Hello, artie.

22:51.738 --> 22:55.539
Did you spend
all weekend talking
about me to your mommy?

22:57.142 --> 22:59.744
My mother and I are no longer
on speaking terms...

22:59.746 --> 23:01.946
At least
until taco Tuesday.

23:03.148 --> 23:05.916
( sighs )
listen, wad-bag,

23:05.918 --> 23:07.752
I know we had
our differences
the other night,

23:07.754 --> 23:10.321
But we sure do
make quite a team.

23:10.323 --> 23:12.123
Speak for yourself,
rooney.

23:12.125 --> 23:14.325
I detest you
with every fiber in my being

23:14.327 --> 23:16.927
And I'm gonna
delete you from my phone.

23:17.963 --> 23:19.697
The fact that I was
even in there

23:19.699 --> 23:21.665
Tells me everything
I need to know.

23:22.868 --> 23:26.070
Maddie rooney's
my girlfriend!

23:26.072 --> 23:28.105
Maddie rooney's my girlfriend!

23:28.107 --> 23:30.775
Maddie rooney's
my girlfriend!
