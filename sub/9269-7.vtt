00:03.296 --> 00:04.616

No.

00:49.509 --> 00:51.549
Oh, dear.

01:01.091 --> 01:03.971
My condolences on your wife.

01:06.371 --> 01:09.091
One day left and you
could be joining her.

01:53.891 --> 01:56.610
..Bid thy holy angels welcome her

01:56.611 --> 01:58.610
and lead her home to paradise.

01:58.611 --> 02:02.370
Let her not undergo
the pains of hell

02:02.371 --> 02:05.810
for she put her hope and trust in me

02:05.811 --> 02:10.729
but establish her in that bliss
which knows no ending.

02:10.731 --> 02:13.250
Through Christ our Lord. Amen.

02:13.251 --> 02:15.570
Lord grant her eternal rest.

02:15.571 --> 02:17.011
Shooting your own mum...

02:18.451 --> 02:20.771
imagine it.

02:21.771 --> 02:23.171
It was an accident.

02:24.531 --> 02:27.731
Bunch of in-breds.
Deserve everything that they get.

02:30.331 --> 02:32.570
Talking of mothers...

02:32.571 --> 02:36.570
I'll be seeing yours tomorrow -

02:36.571 --> 02:38.331
collection day.

02:45.251 --> 02:46.530
Father.

02:46.531 --> 02:48.970
I have offered myself to
Sir Aaron.

02:48.971 --> 02:50.890
Really?

02:50.891 --> 02:54.691
With Miss Alice back home,
he'll need help taking care of her.

02:56.491 --> 02:58.090
How kind of you.

02:58.091 --> 02:59.450
It's the least I could do.

02:59.451 --> 03:01.610
Did you see the marks
on her temples.

03:01.611 --> 03:02.770
Marks?

03:02.771 --> 03:05.690
Reminds me of John XXI.

03:05.691 --> 03:09.050
It is said he believed
that hysteria could be cured

03:09.051 --> 03:11.331
by eating roasted rodents.

03:12.491 --> 03:14.091
How little we have moved on.

03:17.491 --> 03:19.130
Alice?

03:19.131 --> 03:20.411
Talk to me.

03:23.571 --> 03:27.010
Peter, would you be so kind as to
take Alice to the car.

03:27.011 --> 03:28.571
Of course.

03:31.931 --> 03:33.970
How is she?

03:33.971 --> 03:36.611
Well she's still very
disturbed by it all, Father.

03:37.691 --> 03:39.411
She's blocked a lot of it out.

03:40.971 --> 03:45.771
Understandable. Still at least
the police investigation is closed.

03:48.131 --> 03:51.571
The police inspector confirmed
that Alice's gun WAS faulty.

03:52.851 --> 03:54.890
But still she blames herself.

03:54.891 --> 03:56.650
What does the hospital say?

03:56.651 --> 03:59.970
Well, they believe they can make
her better

03:59.971 --> 04:03.730
with this new electric
shock machine of theirs.

04:03.731 --> 04:06.170
Are you thinking of readmitting her?

04:06.171 --> 04:08.290
She's so very withdrawn.

04:08.291 --> 04:12.451
Sir Aaron, can I be of any help?

04:15.131 --> 04:19.011
Well, I think some
spiritual guidance may help.

04:20.571 --> 04:22.451
Mm, I don't think she'd come to me.

04:24.731 --> 04:27.771
Why don't you join Mrs McCarthy
at the house this evening.

04:30.171 --> 04:31.851
I'll see you this evening.

04:36.971 --> 04:41.850
Magnus, would you fetch Miss Alice's
things from the hospital, please?

04:41.851 --> 04:44.370
Oh, and...

04:44.371 --> 04:46.930
and her shotgun
from the police station.

04:46.931 --> 04:48.130
They no longer need it.

04:48.131 --> 04:50.170
Sir Aaron, I was wondering if...
Not right now.

04:50.171 --> 04:52.251
It won't take long...
I said not now.

05:42.131 --> 05:43.531
Time's up.

06:00.571 --> 06:03.531
Oi, Father Dopey,
watch where you're going!

06:04.931 --> 06:07.730
Toffee? You what?

06:07.731 --> 06:10.010
Apparently chewing's
good for anger.

06:10.011 --> 06:11.570
You're a fruit cake!

06:11.571 --> 06:13.611
And a very good day to you too!

06:44.171 --> 06:47.370
What are you doing up there
Mrs McCarthy?

06:47.371 --> 06:48.730
Wasn't my idea.

06:48.731 --> 06:50.690
Well, how could I sit up at front

06:50.691 --> 06:53.811
and leave the Holy Mother
balancing here on the back?

06:55.171 --> 06:56.690
Let me help you down.

06:56.691 --> 06:59.050
It's a wonder I'm alive at all.

06:59.051 --> 07:01.210
He drives like a madman.

07:01.211 --> 07:03.250
Well, there's gratitude for you!

07:03.251 --> 07:04.971
Yes, but you do!

07:07.011 --> 07:08.530
Sir Aaron.

07:08.531 --> 07:10.210
Are you all right?

07:10.211 --> 07:13.850
Oh, it's nothing,
I slipped down the bank.

07:13.851 --> 07:16.971
Silly old fool.
Well, let's go in, I must change.

07:18.571 --> 07:21.610
Who was that man?
Was he a friend of yours?

07:21.611 --> 07:26.251
No, no, no,
he was just asking for directions.

07:29.971 --> 07:33.890
Miss Alice, it's me,
it's Mrs McCarthy.

07:33.891 --> 07:36.051
I'll be right down.

08:02.291 --> 08:04.850
They did everything together.

08:04.851 --> 08:08.810
What about yourself,
how are YOU feeling, Sir Aaron?

08:08.811 --> 08:12.851
Well, you know what they say -
life goes on.

08:14.331 --> 08:15.890
I'm a practical man.

08:15.891 --> 08:18.771
I don't believe in indulging
in one's own misery.

08:20.971 --> 08:22.931
Ah, Peter, come and join us.

08:25.491 --> 08:27.330
I'm too busy, I'm afraid.

08:27.331 --> 08:30.570
First class secretary!
Doesn't know how to relax.

08:30.571 --> 08:32.850
Sir Aaron, may I speak with you?

08:32.851 --> 08:34.210
You know, if it wasn't for him

08:34.211 --> 08:36.929
the Housing Trust would have
collapsed long ago.

08:36.931 --> 08:40.130
And sterling work your
charity does in Kembleford.

08:40.131 --> 08:42.970
Yeah, a pity the Catholic Church
doesn't donate towards it.

08:42.971 --> 08:45.130
Now now, Peter. Now now.

08:45.131 --> 08:48.291
Excuse me... What is it you want?

08:49.891 --> 08:51.210
Cheeky little upstart.

08:51.211 --> 08:52.611
I rather like him.

08:54.051 --> 08:57.570
It's Alice. I barely recognise her.

08:57.571 --> 09:00.850
Oh, well,
it's going to take some time.

09:00.851 --> 09:03.290
No, no, no, it's not that,
it's what they did to her.

09:03.291 --> 09:05.731
Now, Peter... You can't send her
back there, you can't.

09:07.051 --> 09:08.131
Can't?

09:11.051 --> 09:13.211
Who on earth do you think
you're talking to?

09:14.451 --> 09:17.050
Look, I'm sorry, I'm just worried...

09:17.051 --> 09:19.210
Just a little too worried
if you ask me.

09:19.211 --> 09:21.211
Is that really such a bad thing?

09:22.491 --> 09:24.290
Am I so unsuitable?

09:24.291 --> 09:26.410
I should have seen it! Sir Aaron...

09:26.411 --> 09:30.170
Well, now you leave me no choice. I can't
have you living under the same roof as her.

09:30.171 --> 09:32.410
After everything
I have done for you, the Trust.

09:32.411 --> 09:34.411
And you think that
entitles you to...

09:36.331 --> 09:38.491
You have abused my hospitality.

09:41.371 --> 09:43.811
I want you packed
and gone by the morning.

09:50.331 --> 09:52.490
I was just going to check on Alice.

09:52.491 --> 09:54.331
There's no need, Father.

09:56.891 --> 09:58.371
No need.

09:59.931 --> 10:01.291
I'm just going up.

10:10.891 --> 10:12.371
Alice?

10:17.611 --> 10:19.971
Please speak to me.

10:21.611 --> 10:23.691
I only ever wanted
what was best for you.

10:29.971 --> 10:32.131
Joan of Arc.

10:33.531 --> 10:34.770
What?

10:34.771 --> 10:37.491
What you let them do to me.

10:38.691 --> 10:40.851
It's like being burnt alive.

11:21.851 --> 11:25.050
Good night, Mrs McCarthy.
Good night, Father.

11:25.051 --> 11:26.410
Good night, Sir Aaron.

11:26.411 --> 11:28.371
Good night, Sir Aaron,
God bless you.

11:43.131 --> 11:44.931
Going somewhere?

11:46.691 --> 11:48.651
So you think you can help Alice?

11:50.731 --> 11:52.250
I'll do my best.

11:52.251 --> 11:55.250
The last thing she needs right now
is to be force-fed religion.

11:55.251 --> 11:59.610
Alice was baptised a Catholic by me.

11:59.611 --> 12:03.211
Of course! Get them while they're
young, eh, Father?

12:04.411 --> 12:06.371
Atheist.

12:16.811 --> 12:18.211
Alice.

12:21.331 --> 12:23.411
Please may I have your gun?

12:26.451 --> 12:27.811
Thank you.

12:29.531 --> 12:32.371
Your father says you're having
trouble with your memories.

12:34.251 --> 12:36.170
Are you doubting what happened?

12:36.171 --> 12:37.491
No.

12:38.931 --> 12:40.490
I know...

12:40.491 --> 12:42.530
I killed Mummy.

12:42.531 --> 12:43.970
The gun was faulty.

12:43.971 --> 12:46.410
But I'm still to blame.

12:46.411 --> 12:49.610
Ever since I was little,
it was drummed into me,

12:49.611 --> 12:51.850
never point your gun at anyone.

12:51.851 --> 12:55.130
So why did I point it at my mummy?

12:55.131 --> 12:58.490
Why? Perhaps if you went
back into the clearing.

12:58.491 --> 12:59.850
No.

12:59.851 --> 13:02.131
I could come with you.
I said no!

13:03.491 --> 13:05.131
Alice...

13:23.811 --> 13:26.011
Oh, where are you off to now,
Father?

13:27.691 --> 13:30.251
And what are you hoping
to find under there?

13:35.211 --> 13:37.211
Oh! Oh!

13:41.291 --> 13:44.290
He was certainly hit
with some force.

13:44.291 --> 13:46.650
The back of his skull
is completely caved in.

13:46.651 --> 13:48.650
Oh, well, look who's here.

13:48.651 --> 13:50.450
Keep searching for the weapon.

13:50.451 --> 13:52.971
Father Brown.
I don't think it's hidden.

13:54.331 --> 13:57.411
I'm sorry? I think the weapon's
under your feet.

13:58.531 --> 14:00.211
He hit the ground there.

14:04.571 --> 14:06.290
So...

14:06.291 --> 14:09.490
the killer bound him by his hands,

14:09.491 --> 14:12.330
threw him out the window,
and then proceeded to drag his body

14:12.331 --> 14:14.010
under the brush.

14:14.011 --> 14:15.250
I'll show you up.

14:15.251 --> 14:17.091
Ah, very kind.

14:19.171 --> 14:21.091
Looks like he put up a fight.

14:22.491 --> 14:25.250
But why, when he was
thrown out of the window,

14:25.251 --> 14:26.850
are there three tools of death?

14:26.851 --> 14:28.891
Rope, knife, gun.

14:30.371 --> 14:32.891
You can leave the detective work
to me, thank you, Father.

14:35.091 --> 14:36.810
Empty.

14:36.811 --> 14:38.450
Motive, but no suspect.

14:38.451 --> 14:40.930
A little slow off the mark
for you, Father.

14:40.931 --> 14:43.450
The chauffeur's gone AWOL -
drove off late last night...

14:43.451 --> 14:44.890
in Sir Aaron's car.

14:44.891 --> 14:46.251
Ah.

14:47.451 --> 14:50.971
Like I said.
Leave the detective work to you.

14:52.331 --> 14:53.611
Precisely.

15:12.691 --> 15:15.771
He was such a lovely man,
so generous.

15:16.771 --> 15:20.371
The ladies at the institute
used to call him Father Christmas.

15:21.571 --> 15:23.450
He was tied up?

15:23.451 --> 15:25.730
Yes, his hands were bound.

15:25.731 --> 15:26.850
But...

15:26.851 --> 15:28.290
Alice.

15:28.291 --> 15:29.610
There you are.

15:29.611 --> 15:31.410
Miss Alice, I thought
you should know that

15:31.411 --> 15:33.050
we've found your father's car
in town.

15:33.051 --> 15:34.970
Magnus must have left it there
and fled.

15:34.971 --> 15:37.290
After all Sir Aaron did for him!

15:37.291 --> 15:39.410
No-one else would even employ him.

15:39.411 --> 15:41.490
I thought he was
a reformed character.

15:41.491 --> 15:45.410
An innocent man wouldn't flee in the
victim's car and then go on the run.

15:45.411 --> 15:47.330
He's always been very trustworthy.

15:47.331 --> 15:50.450
He's also an ex-convict
with a history of firearms.

15:50.451 --> 15:51.770
Alice...

15:51.771 --> 15:55.490
I think we should talk. Actually,
I need you at the station

15:55.491 --> 15:58.770
to look at the mug-shots of the man
you saw in the lorry.

15:58.771 --> 16:00.530
Surely that can wait.

16:00.531 --> 16:02.691
No.
He could be working with Magnus.

16:04.411 --> 16:07.571
I'll be back as quickly as I can.
I'll take care of her.

16:43.051 --> 16:45.051
Oh!

17:52.091 --> 17:53.771
I hate crucifixes.

17:56.171 --> 17:57.810
Now...

17:57.811 --> 18:00.450
I ain't never cut up
a priest before,

18:00.451 --> 18:02.531
but there's a first
time for everything.

18:04.731 --> 18:06.930
Unless...

18:06.931 --> 18:11.010
you keep shtoom to the
coppers about seeing me.

18:11.011 --> 18:12.411
Deal?

18:14.571 --> 18:15.810
No.

18:15.811 --> 18:17.330
Listen, I'm deadly serious.

18:17.331 --> 18:19.250
All these silly threats.

18:19.251 --> 18:21.091
Silly threats? I'm a vicious killer!

18:22.251 --> 18:24.250
You're scared,

18:24.251 --> 18:27.530
you're scared of being hung
for a crime you didn't commit.

18:27.531 --> 18:28.891
Too right!

18:30.371 --> 18:33.091
If the coppers know I've been round,
they'll fit me right up!

18:34.811 --> 18:38.250
But if you confessed your sins
to me here and now,

18:38.251 --> 18:41.370
I'd be duty bound to
keep shtoom, wouldn't I?

18:41.371 --> 18:43.090
How'd you know I was a Catholic?

18:43.091 --> 18:44.890
You said crucifix not cross.

18:44.891 --> 18:47.091
How about it? Act of contrition?

18:48.051 --> 18:51.490
Well, I don't know.
I mean, there's so many

18:51.491 --> 18:56.451
and, well, I've been
a very naughty boy.

18:59.011 --> 19:01.650
I keep seeing him. Who?

19:01.651 --> 19:03.450
Daddy.

19:03.451 --> 19:05.250
Tied up like an animal.

19:05.251 --> 19:07.050
Alice, don't.

19:07.051 --> 19:09.611
Why haven't they arrested
Magnus yet?

19:12.971 --> 19:14.771
I can't take it any more.

19:16.011 --> 19:17.770
It'll get better.

19:17.771 --> 19:20.290
Make it go away,
make love to me again.

19:20.291 --> 19:21.371
Peter?

19:22.691 --> 19:24.410
It's not that I don't want to.

19:24.411 --> 19:27.730
It just feels like I'm taking
advantage. That's ridiculous.

19:27.731 --> 19:30.570
After everything that's happened,
it doesn't seem right.

19:30.571 --> 19:32.250
To make love to a mad woman,
you mean?

19:32.251 --> 19:34.570
That's not what I'm saying.
I'm not mad!

19:34.571 --> 19:36.850
Alice... Don't touch me.

19:36.851 --> 19:39.770
You're just like everyone else.
That's not true.

19:39.771 --> 19:41.051
Prove it.

19:45.291 --> 19:46.330
Look, Alice...

19:46.331 --> 19:49.451
Come on, prove it.

20:01.691 --> 20:06.290
Then Wednesday, I repossessed
all of Mr Bedford's furniture.

20:06.291 --> 20:08.771
He was in that tin bath.
when I called.

20:09.971 --> 20:12.690
Thursday, went
and worried Jed Bosworth -

20:12.691 --> 20:15.371
he's falling behind
with his payments.

20:16.571 --> 20:19.370
Yesterday? Yesterday...?

20:19.371 --> 20:22.450
Yesterday I went and put
the frighteners on Sir Aaron.

20:22.451 --> 20:23.650
And that's all!

20:23.651 --> 20:26.290
Toffs are always the worst,
you know.

20:26.291 --> 20:29.651
He owes a fortune to every
building contractor in this county.

20:31.171 --> 20:32.330
Anything else?

20:32.331 --> 20:35.130
Then I went and paid his
chauffeur's mum a visit.

20:35.131 --> 20:36.770
Mrs Magnus.

20:36.771 --> 20:38.530
Did you hurt her?

20:38.531 --> 20:39.650
No!

20:39.651 --> 20:41.490
Just had a strong word!

20:41.491 --> 20:44.930
Her son came through, paid all her
back rent and the interest.

20:44.931 --> 20:49.731
And then of course
I knocked you off your bike.

20:55.291 --> 20:58.410
Ego te absolvo ab omnibus
censuris, et peccatis

20:58.411 --> 21:02.851
in nomine Patris, et Filii,
et Spiritus Sancti. Amen. Amen.

21:04.091 --> 21:07.090
What, is that it? No penance?
Nothing on me knees?

21:07.091 --> 21:08.610
Rocking horse?

21:08.611 --> 21:11.570
Oh, yeah, went and collected it
off some kid.

21:11.571 --> 21:13.330
Only decent thing in the house.

21:13.331 --> 21:15.370
Mum had fallen behind with her loan.

21:15.371 --> 21:17.331
So you took her child's toy?

21:18.371 --> 21:20.770
You absolve sins, I collect debts!

21:20.771 --> 21:22.291
That's what I do, mate!

21:26.771 --> 21:28.771
Oh, sorry about your bike.

21:31.091 --> 21:32.690
Don't you want your crucifix?

21:32.691 --> 21:34.531
You can keep it.

21:35.531 --> 21:37.251
Nutty as a fruit cake.

21:40.371 --> 21:41.971
What you looking at?

21:45.971 --> 21:47.810
Father?

21:47.811 --> 21:49.131
Hello?

21:50.251 --> 21:53.570
Mrs Magnus, haven't seen Father,
have you?

21:53.571 --> 21:55.531
No, sorry.

22:04.971 --> 22:06.491
Oh!

22:08.411 --> 22:10.490
Oh, that hurt.

22:10.491 --> 22:13.010
He can't have got far,
you take this side,

22:13.011 --> 22:15.811
I'll start here, every door.

22:18.691 --> 22:20.771
Ignore them.

22:24.491 --> 22:27.170
Father.
Been looking for you everywhere!

22:27.171 --> 22:29.890
Found out Magnus was
hiding in the church.

22:29.891 --> 22:32.330
Have you told the police?
Do I look like a grass?

22:32.331 --> 22:34.890
Anyway, he clobbered me
and scarpered.

22:34.891 --> 22:36.250
He did it, didn't he?

22:36.251 --> 22:39.211
Well, it certainly looks
as if he stole the money.

22:41.411 --> 22:43.210
What have you done?

22:43.211 --> 22:45.850
Poor old faithful Bucephalus,
rest in peace.

22:45.851 --> 22:47.531
I'll see what I can do.

22:51.451 --> 22:53.170
Mrs Magnus.

22:53.171 --> 22:55.490
Father, I suppose
you've heard the news.

22:55.491 --> 22:56.690
Yes.

22:56.691 --> 22:59.090
I can't believe he's gone back
to his old ways.

22:59.091 --> 23:00.930
When was the last time you saw him?

23:00.931 --> 23:04.130
Er, this morning.
He stayed last night.

23:04.131 --> 23:06.650
But I've no idea where he is now.

23:06.651 --> 23:08.770
Well, if you do see him again,

23:08.771 --> 23:11.930
tell him to meet me at the barn
at the Armstrongs at 8:00pm.

23:11.931 --> 23:13.090
Meet you?

23:13.091 --> 23:14.770
I won't turn him in.

23:14.771 --> 23:18.411
Better to confess to God
than to the police.

23:41.011 --> 23:42.531
Mum!

23:48.611 --> 23:51.610
Alice, I know you're scared,

23:51.611 --> 23:54.290
but I'm not going anywhere.

23:54.291 --> 23:56.170
You think I'm pathetic.

23:56.171 --> 24:00.410
No, I think we should wait, that's
all, out of respect for your father.

24:00.411 --> 24:03.451
Look, if it wasn't for him,
I'd still be a farm hand.

24:04.611 --> 24:06.771
Before I went to hospital,
you'd have married me.

24:14.771 --> 24:18.011
Mrs McCarthy,
why are you hiding in there?

24:19.131 --> 24:20.810
Fornication.

24:20.811 --> 24:22.731
I caught them at it once already.

24:23.771 --> 24:24.810
I see.

24:24.811 --> 24:28.611
And I will not let Miss Alice be
taken advantage of for a second time.

24:30.851 --> 24:32.811
Keep up the good work, Mrs McCarthy.

24:37.571 --> 24:40.330
Father,
we were beginning to get worried.

24:40.331 --> 24:42.211
Speak for yourself.

24:43.571 --> 24:45.171
I'll see you back at the house.

24:53.251 --> 24:56.330
Daddy's favourite spot.
I can see why.

24:56.331 --> 24:59.650
So what's it going to be
this time, Father?

24:59.651 --> 25:01.250
A sermon about grief?

25:01.251 --> 25:05.331
Don't tell the Bishop, but I'm not
very keen on sermons - too boring.

25:06.331 --> 25:08.690
Do you still have gaps
in your memory?

25:08.691 --> 25:10.291
Yes.

25:11.491 --> 25:14.090
But I meant what I said, I'm
not going back to the clearing.

25:14.091 --> 25:16.250
What are you afraid of?

25:16.251 --> 25:17.611
The truth.

25:18.651 --> 25:20.371
Perhaps I'm not supposed to remember.

25:21.411 --> 25:24.411
An experienced shot does not
aim their gun by accident.

25:25.531 --> 25:27.250
You're saying it's intentional?

25:27.251 --> 25:29.370
I don't know what to think any more.

25:29.371 --> 25:31.251
Maybe I am sick in the mind.

25:32.931 --> 25:36.811
It won't last for ever you know -
this self-loathing, it will pass.

25:38.051 --> 25:39.331
And be replaced with what?

25:41.851 --> 25:43.811
He loves you. Does he?

25:45.171 --> 25:46.611
Is he my saviour?

25:48.051 --> 25:49.970
And what about God?

25:49.971 --> 25:51.690
Where does he fit in all of this?

25:51.691 --> 25:53.730
Where do you want him to fit in?

25:53.731 --> 25:56.090
I don't know if I believe any more.

25:56.091 --> 25:58.570
But if he does exist,

25:58.571 --> 26:02.050
it's rather evident he's turned
his back on me, don't you think?

26:02.051 --> 26:04.250
He'll be there...

26:04.251 --> 26:05.770
when you want him most.

26:05.771 --> 26:08.371
I like you, Father, I always have...

26:09.451 --> 26:10.971
..but you're an idealist.

26:52.011 --> 26:53.891
Magnus, it's Father Brown.

26:58.211 --> 27:00.090
Magnus.

27:00.091 --> 27:01.571
Magnus?

27:02.611 --> 27:05.650
So... can you help me, Father?

27:05.651 --> 27:07.251
Hopefully, if you tell me the truth.

27:08.531 --> 27:10.290
I heard you paid
your mother's back rent -

27:10.291 --> 27:11.810
that was an awful lot of money.

27:11.811 --> 27:13.210
It's not what you think.

27:13.211 --> 27:16.850
Sir Aaron let me take the car last night
to go and see her, I was worried.

27:16.851 --> 27:20.130
When I got in, there was an envelope
of money on the driver's seat.

27:20.131 --> 27:23.050
It had my name on it,
I was sure it was from Sir Aaron.

27:23.051 --> 27:25.090
Why didn't you tell the police?

27:25.091 --> 27:28.610
Well, I heard this morning
he'd been robbed and murdered, I...

27:28.611 --> 27:30.050
I got scared.

27:30.051 --> 27:32.010
With him dead and me with the
money...

27:32.011 --> 27:33.611
You'd be the main suspect.

27:34.531 --> 27:37.170
Exactly, why would I kill him,
Father?

27:37.171 --> 27:40.090
I mean, he was good to me.
Then who did kill him?

27:40.091 --> 27:42.690
I wasn't the only one
in the house with a motive.

27:42.691 --> 27:44.290
Peter?

27:44.291 --> 27:45.930
So he could marry Miss Alice.

27:45.931 --> 27:47.331
I wasn't thinking of him.

27:48.891 --> 27:51.811
Since killing her mother,
she's not been right.

27:52.851 --> 27:54.250
She adored her father.

27:54.251 --> 27:56.490
Not after what he did...

27:56.491 --> 27:58.131
the electric shocks.

28:01.971 --> 28:04.211
Know anything about these?

28:05.371 --> 28:08.050
Magnus, this is Inspector Sullivan.
You told them!

28:08.051 --> 28:09.971
No. I know you're in there.

28:11.091 --> 28:12.570
Magnus, what are you doing?

28:12.571 --> 28:15.570
Give yourself up. I'm not swinging
for something that I never did.

28:15.571 --> 28:17.330
Magnus, no!

28:17.331 --> 28:18.411
Stay where you are.

28:19.611 --> 28:21.411
After him, go on!

28:28.011 --> 28:29.890
Argh!

28:29.891 --> 28:32.490
How did you know where to find him?

28:32.491 --> 28:35.331
I saw you talking to his mother,
so had you followed.

28:47.651 --> 28:49.370
What's happened?

28:49.371 --> 28:50.731
We've arrested Magnus.

28:52.131 --> 28:53.931
And broke his arm in the process.

28:55.011 --> 28:57.891
It was his own fault, resisting
arrest. Are you all right?

28:59.171 --> 29:00.530
Of course she's not all right.

29:00.531 --> 29:03.410
These thugs are out there
attacking people.

29:03.411 --> 29:05.290
Talk about a police state.

29:05.291 --> 29:07.810
Oh, Godless and a communist!

29:07.811 --> 29:11.650
Look, despite certain people's
intuition that Magnus is innocent,

29:11.651 --> 29:13.011
the facts say otherwise.

29:14.771 --> 29:18.050
Yes, well, the money from the safe
was left on the seat of the car,

29:18.051 --> 29:20.490
so Magnus may have been framed.

29:20.491 --> 29:21.811
Framed?

29:23.371 --> 29:25.730
I hardly think that's
the money that was stolen.

29:25.731 --> 29:27.530
No, I found them by the lake.

29:27.531 --> 29:29.450
In the ashes of a fire.

29:29.451 --> 29:32.450
Why would someone
want to burn old coins?

29:32.451 --> 29:35.451
Old coins turned into buttons.

29:36.731 --> 29:37.931
Magnus' jacket?

29:39.611 --> 29:41.130
Solid silver.

29:41.131 --> 29:44.290
Think Magnus can afford
a jacket like that?

29:44.291 --> 29:45.531
No.

29:46.811 --> 29:48.011
But I could.

29:49.931 --> 29:52.010
They're from the blazer
I bought you.

29:52.011 --> 29:54.771
The one you wore last night.

29:55.851 --> 29:56.891
Did I?

29:59.291 --> 30:01.210
And you've been near a fire.

30:01.211 --> 30:03.531
Why would you burn your jacket,
Mr Royce?

30:05.011 --> 30:06.770
I...

30:06.771 --> 30:08.490
I just did.

30:08.491 --> 30:09.611
Well, why?

30:11.731 --> 30:13.650
Alice... Peter?

30:13.651 --> 30:15.970
I'm sorry. I knew it!

30:15.971 --> 30:18.290
Were you disposing
of incriminating evidence?

30:18.291 --> 30:19.890
Answer him.

30:19.891 --> 30:22.610
Answer him!
What was on the jacket, Mr Royce?

30:22.611 --> 30:24.490
Blood?

30:24.491 --> 30:27.170
No. How could you?

30:27.171 --> 30:29.251
How could you!

30:30.251 --> 30:32.730
Peter Royce, I'm arresting
you on suspicion of murder.

30:32.731 --> 30:35.450
You are not obliged to say
anything unless you wish to do so...

30:35.451 --> 30:37.130
OK, OK! Alice, I love you.

30:37.131 --> 30:41.090
..whatever you say will be taken down
in writing and may be given in evidence.

30:41.091 --> 30:42.610
Will you be letting Magnus go now?

30:42.611 --> 30:45.451
No. I suspect they
were in it together.

30:46.611 --> 30:47.810
Together?

30:47.811 --> 30:50.010
Explains your three tools of death.

30:50.011 --> 30:52.170
One had a gun, the other a knife,

30:52.171 --> 30:54.330
tied Sir Armstrong up
with the rope,

30:54.331 --> 30:55.810
robbed him, killed him. Simple.

30:55.811 --> 30:59.130
Except that he wasn't tied up
with the rope.

30:59.131 --> 31:01.530
It was the cord from
his own dressing gown.

31:01.531 --> 31:03.610
They adapted their plan.

31:03.611 --> 31:06.450
Using cord to bind someone's wrists
is much easier

31:06.451 --> 31:08.331
than using a thick piece of rope.

31:33.451 --> 31:34.530
Is he ready to go?

31:34.531 --> 31:37.610
Father Brown has decided
to stay a little longer.

31:37.611 --> 31:38.971
Nobody tells me anything.

31:40.491 --> 31:41.810
Sid.

31:41.811 --> 31:44.490
Have you mended my bicycle
already?

31:44.491 --> 31:46.490
Nah, lost cause,
threw it in the canal.

31:46.491 --> 31:48.651
Anyway, I hear the murder's
been solved.

31:49.811 --> 31:51.370
I think Magnus is innocent,

31:51.371 --> 31:54.130
which means there's still too many
tools of death for one person -

31:54.131 --> 31:56.171
a gun, a knife, and a rope.

32:05.211 --> 32:08.450
Now it's important
that you eat something.

32:08.451 --> 32:11.850
When I think how
that monster deceived you.

32:11.851 --> 32:15.011
Well, I suppose that's
where atheism gets you.

32:16.811 --> 32:19.731
Now, you make a start on that
and I'll go get the tea.

32:25.771 --> 32:27.851
Looks like you were wrong. Sorry?

32:28.851 --> 32:30.291
Peter's not my saviour.

32:31.851 --> 32:33.930
Perhaps you're wrong
about other things too.

32:33.931 --> 32:37.090
Alice, I know how it must seem...
Save your breath.

32:37.091 --> 32:39.171
God doesn't exist.

32:41.291 --> 32:42.690
Do you really believe that?

32:42.691 --> 32:46.570
I've been awake all night,

32:46.571 --> 32:49.210
waiting for some guidance,

32:49.211 --> 32:51.131
for him to answer me.

32:52.531 --> 32:55.891
As always, nothing!
What were you asking him?

32:57.491 --> 32:59.970
If you wanted an answer,
there must have been a question.

32:59.971 --> 33:01.411
What was it, Alice?

33:03.811 --> 33:06.770
Whether I should go to the police

33:06.771 --> 33:08.291
and confess.

33:10.251 --> 33:13.970
It's my fault that
they didn't catch Peter sooner.

33:13.971 --> 33:18.050
I lied to the police,
I withheld information.

33:18.051 --> 33:19.611
About your father's death.

33:21.491 --> 33:23.570
The night he was killed,

33:23.571 --> 33:26.530
I went to apologise
for upsetting him

33:26.531 --> 33:28.171
about my treatment.

33:29.291 --> 33:31.411
But I found him tied up.

33:35.331 --> 33:36.571
Was he alive?

33:38.091 --> 33:39.371
He was drunk.

33:40.411 --> 33:42.291
I went to get a knife
to cut him free.

33:44.051 --> 33:46.290
Ah! Daddy, who did this to you?

33:46.291 --> 33:47.890
No, Alice, Alice...

33:47.891 --> 33:50.690
Look, I'll explain everything
tomorrow.

33:50.691 --> 33:52.730
Just tell me...
I must ask you to leave.

33:52.731 --> 33:55.010
..how long have you been there?
Just talk to me.

33:55.011 --> 33:57.450
Don't say anything to anybody,
will you? Please don't.

33:57.451 --> 33:59.651
I don't... Alice, please!

34:00.731 --> 34:02.090
I must ask you to leave.

34:02.091 --> 34:03.411
Please.

34:05.771 --> 34:07.571
Alice...

34:09.011 --> 34:10.731
..sorry.

34:14.451 --> 34:17.929
That's all that happened. I swear
I wasn't there when he was murdered.

34:17.931 --> 34:20.210
So why'd you keep
it from the police?

34:21.731 --> 34:25.610
Peter said the police would never
believe something so outlandish,

34:25.610 --> 34:29.810
that they think that I had something
to do with his murder.

34:29.811 --> 34:31.371
And you believed Peter?

34:32.971 --> 34:34.451
I was scared, Father.

34:35.610 --> 34:38.370
Scared I'd have to go
back to that hospital.

34:38.371 --> 34:40.650
You don't know what it's like.

34:42.251 --> 34:43.610
Oh, Alice.

34:49.610 --> 34:51.690
Too farfetched to be true,
if you ask me.

34:52.811 --> 34:54.449
Too farfetched not to be true.

34:54.451 --> 34:56.489
If Peter threw Sir Aaron
out the window,

34:56.491 --> 34:58.410
why would he tie him
to a radiator first?

34:58.411 --> 35:00.010
That don't make sense. No.

35:00.011 --> 35:02.010
Unless he tortured him.

35:02.011 --> 35:03.371
Sir Aaron wasn't tortured.

35:05.851 --> 35:09.051
Oh, what an idiot I've been.

35:12.571 --> 35:15.090
Peter was trying to restrain him.
Restrain him?

35:15.091 --> 35:17.450
He wasn't trying to kill him,
he was trying to save him!

35:17.451 --> 35:19.051
From who?

35:20.131 --> 35:21.291
Rope.

35:23.091 --> 35:24.770
Chipped paint.

35:24.771 --> 35:25.891
Gun.

35:31.011 --> 35:32.690
Gunpowder.

35:32.691 --> 35:34.131
It was his gun.

35:37.971 --> 35:43.050
Peter came in
he was intent on killing himself,

35:43.051 --> 35:45.170
Sir Aaron, no, no!

35:45.171 --> 35:47.091
Leave me alone. No, please!

35:49.971 --> 35:52.130
No! Let me die.

35:52.131 --> 35:54.770
Give me the gun! Give me...!

35:54.771 --> 35:57.011
So Peter had to tie him up.

35:59.691 --> 36:01.730
And later, when the ropes were
cut...

36:01.731 --> 36:02.851
He jumped.

36:04.171 --> 36:06.691
So, Daddy wasn't murdered?

36:08.051 --> 36:09.491
No.

36:17.371 --> 36:19.411
Would you wait for me, please, Sid?

36:24.451 --> 36:26.531
You've got five minutes.

36:28.331 --> 36:31.410
You've come to read me
my last rites?

36:31.411 --> 36:34.051
Why would I? You're innocent.

36:35.411 --> 36:36.810
I'm sorry?

36:36.811 --> 36:40.250
Sir Aaron really did leave
that money for Magnus, didn't he?

36:40.251 --> 36:43.810
Always the philanthropist.
His final act of charity.

36:43.811 --> 36:45.531
Before he ended it all.

36:47.051 --> 36:48.731
You know?

36:51.891 --> 36:53.611
It wasn't your fault.

36:56.851 --> 36:58.610
Yeah...

36:58.611 --> 37:00.650
yeah, it was.
I never should have left him.

37:00.651 --> 37:02.011
Why did you?

37:03.731 --> 37:07.010
After tying him up, I...

37:07.011 --> 37:10.091
I waited for him to fall asleep.

37:12.851 --> 37:15.170
I went to get a bottle...

37:15.171 --> 37:19.891
to steady my nerves, and
keep me going through the night.

37:22.251 --> 37:24.611
'I was only gone a few minutes.'

37:35.651 --> 37:37.930
'Why did he kill himself?'

37:37.931 --> 37:39.291
'Grief?'

37:40.531 --> 37:42.570
Debt?

37:42.571 --> 37:44.611
He owed thousands.

37:46.171 --> 37:49.250
It was all in his suicide note.

37:49.251 --> 37:50.891
What note?

37:54.451 --> 37:56.930
I burned it.

37:56.931 --> 37:59.210
So, let me get this straight,

37:59.211 --> 38:01.410
after he jumped, you tied him up,

38:01.411 --> 38:04.490
and dragged him under a bush
to make it look like murder?

38:04.491 --> 38:07.130
I had to protect Alice!

38:07.131 --> 38:09.130
Blaming herself
for her mother's death,

38:09.131 --> 38:10.930
it almost destroyed her.

38:10.931 --> 38:14.690
If she knew that cutting the ropes
caused her father's death as well, then...

38:14.691 --> 38:16.650
She mustn't find out anything,
Father!

38:16.651 --> 38:18.131
Father Brown!

38:22.251 --> 38:24.371
'I've killed the ones I love.'

38:28.371 --> 38:32.050
'My life's become a...haze, a blur.'

38:32.051 --> 38:34.331
I'll go round the side!

38:41.051 --> 38:44.210
'I'm sinking.'

38:44.211 --> 38:46.011
Alice!

38:47.451 --> 38:49.051
Alice!

38:53.011 --> 38:55.650
'Suffocating.

38:55.651 --> 38:57.411
'Beyond help.'

39:02.371 --> 39:05.171
'Forgive me.'

39:25.291 --> 39:27.090
Come on!

39:27.091 --> 39:29.410
Oh, we're too late, Father!
We're too late!

39:29.411 --> 39:32.490
Alice, can you hear me? Alice?
She's gone. No.

39:32.491 --> 39:35.330
No. Alice, don't die like this.

39:35.331 --> 39:37.891
God is here. He's with you.

39:39.011 --> 39:42.611
Alice? Can you hear me? Alice?

39:48.691 --> 39:50.811
Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah!

39:52.651 --> 39:54.490
That's it, that's it, that's it!

39:54.491 --> 39:56.531
Good girl!
It's going to be all right!

40:43.531 --> 40:45.531
You warm enough? Hmm.

40:51.371 --> 40:53.690
And how are you feeling today?

40:53.691 --> 40:56.770
I'm not sure, really. Erm...

40:56.771 --> 40:59.811
relieved... that it wasn't my fault.

41:01.251 --> 41:03.450
But I can't stop
thinking about Daddy.

41:03.451 --> 41:05.730
If I hadn't have cut that rope

41:05.731 --> 41:09.250
and sobered him up,
he'd still be here.

41:09.251 --> 41:15.090
Peter, what exactly did the note
that Sir Aaron left behind say?

41:15.091 --> 41:17.850
Just that he was sorry.

41:17.851 --> 41:20.290
For Alice not to worry
about his debts.

41:20.291 --> 41:21.770
Why would he say that?

41:21.771 --> 41:25.090
Well, I guess he knew
his debts would die with him.

41:25.091 --> 41:28.810
He transferred the estate
into Alice's name last week.

41:28.811 --> 41:32.531
So, his suicide wasn't a drunken
moment of madness or despair.

41:33.691 --> 41:36.290
He would have killed himself
the next night, or the next,

41:36.291 --> 41:38.170
or the next.

41:38.171 --> 41:40.410
Your father's death,
like your mother's,

41:40.411 --> 41:42.131
had nothing to do with you.

41:44.731 --> 41:46.771
He planned it.

41:48.811 --> 41:50.291
Thank you.

41:53.891 --> 41:55.651
Ah! Excuse me.

42:06.531 --> 42:08.650
Have you come
to give me a ride home?

42:08.651 --> 42:10.856
Better than that.

42:10.948 --> 42:12.548
Ta-dah!

42:16.973 --> 42:19.413
Did you honestly think
I threw it in the canal?

42:22.533 --> 42:25.533
Thank you, Sid.
Yeah, just don't break it this time.

42:26.613 --> 42:28.093
Race you back!

42:46.453 --> 42:48.493
And off we go again.
