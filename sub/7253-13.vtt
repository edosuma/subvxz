00:10.051 --> 00:11.971
HEY.

00:10.051 --> 00:11.971
DID I WAKE YOU?

00:12.011 --> 00:14.014
'CAUSE I BRUSHED MY TEETH

00:12.011 --> 00:14.014
IN THE SHOWER

00:14.055 --> 00:15.933
SO YOU WOULDN'T HEAR

00:14.055 --> 00:15.933
THE SINK RUN.

00:15.975 --> 00:17.726
NO, YOU DIDN'T

00:15.975 --> 00:17.726
WAKE ME UP.

00:17.768 --> 00:19.102
BUT THEN IT OCCURRED TO ME

00:19.144 --> 00:21.188
THAT YOU COULD PROBABLY HEAR

00:19.144 --> 00:21.188
THE SHOWER RUN,

00:21.229 --> 00:22.773
AND THAT DEFEATED

00:21.229 --> 00:22.773
THE PURPOSE

00:22.815 --> 00:24.650
OF THE WHOLE

00:22.815 --> 00:24.650
SHOWER-TOOTHBRUSH COMBO.

00:24.692 --> 00:25.985
WHY ARE YOU UP SO EARLY?

00:26.025 --> 00:27.569
OH, WELL, YOU KNOW ME.

00:27.611 --> 00:29.864
I DO, SO WHY ARE YOU UP

00:27.611 --> 00:29.864

00:29.905 --> 00:31.448
I HAVE CHORES.

00:31.490 --> 00:32.825
IT'S 6:00 IN THE MORNING.

00:32.867 --> 00:34.660
WELL, IT'S

00:32.867 --> 00:34.660

00:34.702 --> 00:36.370

00:36.411 --> 00:39.790
FEEDING CHICKENS,

00:39.832 --> 00:41.792
SLOPPING PIGS.

00:41.834 --> 00:44.545
YOU HAVE TO SLOP PIGS?

00:41.834 --> 00:44.545
THEY'RE CERTAINLY NOT

00:41.834 --> 00:44.545
GONNA SLOP THEMSELVES.

00:44.586 --> 00:45.838
YOU'RE BEING EVASIVE.

00:45.880 --> 00:47.006
I'M NOT BEING EVASIVE.

00:47.046 --> 00:48.757
I'M TRYING

00:47.046 --> 00:48.757

WHY WON'T YOU TELL ME

00:51.343 --> 00:53.762

00:53.804 --> 00:55.639
WELL...I'M GOING

YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO DO THIS

01:38.348 --> 01:40.434
ALL BY YOURSELF.

01:40.475 --> 01:42.603
NO, IT'S FINE.

01:40.475 --> 01:42.603
I'M A GREAT CANCELER.

03:07.813 --> 03:10.524
AND WHAT ARE THOSE?

03:10.565 --> 03:11.608
FAIRY WINGS.

03:11.650 --> 03:14.069
FAIRY WINGS --

03:11.650 --> 03:14.069
SO ROMANTIC.

03:14.111 --> 03:15.278
DO THEY SMELL GOOD?

03:15.320 --> 03:16.905
OHH. TERRIBLE.

03:16.947 --> 03:19.158
FAIRY WINGS SMELL LIKE A VERY

03:16.947 --> 03:19.158
DIFFERENT PART OF THE FAIRY,

03:19.198 --> 03:20.575
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

03:20.617 --> 03:23.370
SOOKIE!

03:20.617 --> 03:23.370
HI! DON'T SMELL

03:20.617 --> 03:23.370
THE FAIRY WINGS.

03:23.411 --> 03:25.204
DON'T WHAT?

03:23.411 --> 03:25.204
NEVER MIND.

03:25.246 --> 03:26.581
SORRY I'M SO LATE.

03:26.623 --> 03:28.834
IT GAVE ME A CHANCE

03:26.623 --> 03:28.834
TO SCOPE OUT THE PLACE.

03:28.876 --> 03:30.669
SHARON OVER THERE

03:28.876 --> 03:30.669
HAS GREAT STUFF,

03:30.711 --> 03:32.504
BUT SHE IS COMPLETELY

03:30.711 --> 03:32.504
ANTI-HAGGLE.

03:32.546 --> 03:34.673
"THIS IS MY PRICE,

03:32.546 --> 03:34.673
AND YOU WILL PAY IT."

03:34.715 --> 03:37.342
THIS IS ME WALKING AWAY FROM YOU

03:34.715 --> 03:37.342
OVER TO MIGUEL'S,

03:37.384 --> 03:39.594
WHO'S VERY HAGGLE-FRIENDLY,

03:37.384 --> 03:39.594
BUT HIS ROSES SUCK.

03:39.636 --> 03:41.471
DO YOU WANT ROSES?

03:39.636 --> 03:41.471
SOOKIE --

03:41.513 --> 03:44.307
BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T, I SAW

03:41.513 --> 03:44.307
SOME BLUEBELLS OVER AT TIM'S

03:44.349 --> 03:47.061
THAT I KNOW ARE NOT YOUR

03:44.349 --> 03:47.061
NORMAL-BOUQUET KIND OF CHOICE,

03:47.102 --> 03:49.521
BUT WE CAN MAKE SOMETHING

03:47.102 --> 03:49.521
INTERESTING OUT OF THEM.

03:49.563 --> 03:50.772
SOOKIE...

03:49.563 --> 03:50.772
YES?

03:50.814 --> 03:52.858
THE WEDDING

03:50.814 --> 03:52.858
HAS BEEN POSTPONED.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.151
WHAT DID YOU DO?

03:54.193 --> 03:55.819
WHAT DID I DO?

03:55.861 --> 03:58.530
DID YOU GET COLD FEET?

03:55.861 --> 03:58.530
YOU CAN'T GET COLD FEET.

03:58.572 --> 04:01.075
WE NEED TO PUT SOME NICE

03:58.572 --> 04:01.075
WOOL SOCKS ON THOSE FEET,

04:01.116 --> 04:03.618
BECAUSE LUKE

04:01.116 --> 04:03.618
IS PERFECT FOR YOU.

04:01.116 --> 04:03.618
I KNOW.

04:03.660 --> 04:05.704
HE WAITED FOR YOU

04:03.660 --> 04:05.704
TO GET OVER CHRISTOPHER.

04:05.746 --> 04:08.623
HE WAITED FOR YOU TO GET OVER

04:05.746 --> 04:08.623
MAX. WHY DO YOU DO THIS?

04:08.665 --> 04:11.919
WHY DO YOU WANT TO MAKE

04:08.665 --> 04:11.919
YOURSELF MISERABLE?

04:08.665 --> 04:11.919
HE HAS A KID.

04:11.960 --> 04:13.378
WHO HAS A KID?

04:11.960 --> 04:13.378
LUKE HAS A KID.

04:13.420 --> 04:15.338
LUKE HAS A KID?

04:13.420 --> 04:15.338
LUKE HAS A KID.

04:15.380 --> 04:18.341
A KID, LIKE A GOAT?

04:15.380 --> 04:18.341
A KID, LIKE A DAUGHTER.

04:15.380 --> 04:18.341
SHE'S 12 YEARS OLD.

04:18.383 --> 04:21.511
HE FOUND OUT A FEW MONTHS AGO,

04:18.383 --> 04:21.511
AND HE JUST TOLD ME YESTERDAY.

04:21.553 --> 04:22.763
HOLY MOLY.

04:22.804 --> 04:24.472
HE'S COMPLETELY IN SHOCK,

04:24.514 --> 04:26.808
AND HE'S TRYING TO HANDLE IT

04:24.514 --> 04:26.808
THE BEST WAY HE CAN.

04:26.850 --> 04:28.685
DRINKING?

04:26.850 --> 04:28.685
NO.

04:28.727 --> 04:32.147
XANAX?

04:28.727 --> 04:32.147
NO. HE'S TRYING TO BE A FATHER,

04:28.727 --> 04:32.147
AND I APPLAUD THAT.

04:32.189 --> 04:35.650
FOR 12 YEARS LUKE'S HAD

04:32.189 --> 04:35.650
A DAUGHTER JUST WALKING AROUND?

04:35.692 --> 04:37.652
YEAH.

04:35.692 --> 04:37.652
THAT IS CRAZY!

04:37.694 --> 04:39.404
OH, MY GOD.

04:37.694 --> 04:39.404
WHAT?

04:39.446 --> 04:40.739
I WONDER IF JACKSON

04:39.446 --> 04:40.739
HAS A LOVE CHILD.

04:40.781 --> 04:42.199
WHAT?

04:42.241 --> 04:44.618
I SAW THIS KID WANDERING

04:42.241 --> 04:44.618
AROUND TOWN THE OTHER DAY.

04:44.659 --> 04:46.536
HE LOOKED EXACTLY

04:44.659 --> 04:46.536
LIKE JACKSON,

04:46.578 --> 04:48.663
AND HIS VOICE

04:46.578 --> 04:48.663
WAS EXACTLY LIKE JACKSON'S,

04:48.705 --> 04:51.583
PLUS HE WAS HOLDING A BANANA,

04:48.705 --> 04:51.583
SO I THINK HE LIKES FRUIT.

04:51.625 --> 04:53.668
JACKSON DOESN'T HAVE A SON

04:51.625 --> 04:53.668
HE DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT.

04:53.710 --> 04:55.712
WHY NOT? LUKE HAD A DAUGHTER

04:53.710 --> 04:55.712
HE DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT.

04:55.754 --> 04:58.757
I KNOW.

04:55.754 --> 04:58.757
YOU THINK LUKE'S

04:55.754 --> 04:58.757
THE ONLY ONE WITH A PAST?

04:58.799 --> 05:00.634
YOU THINK JACKSON WAS A MONK

04:58.799 --> 05:00.634
WHEN I MET HIM?

05:00.675 --> 05:02.719
HE HAD SEED,

05:00.675 --> 05:02.719
AND HE PASSED IT AROUND.

05:02.761 --> 05:04.596
SOOKIE...

05:04.638 --> 05:06.765
SORRY. RIGHT. SORRY.

05:04.638 --> 05:06.765
SO, HOW IS LUKE?

05:06.807 --> 05:08.391
HE'S JUST TRYING TO DEAL.

05:08.433 --> 05:10.727
I MEAN, HE WANTS TO DO

05:08.433 --> 05:10.727
THE RIGHT THING BY APRIL.

05:10.769 --> 05:11.728
THAT'S HER NAME --

05:10.769 --> 05:11.728
APRIL.

05:11.770 --> 05:13.188
PRETTY NAME.

05:13.230 --> 05:14.522
HE'S JUST TRYING TO FIGURE

05:13.230 --> 05:14.522
EVERYTHING OUT,

05:14.564 --> 05:16.441
AND THE WEDDING

05:14.564 --> 05:16.441
WAS COMING UP SO FAST,

05:16.483 --> 05:18.152
WE DECIDED TO POSTPONE IT.

05:18.193 --> 05:19.611
THAT SUCKS.

05:18.193 --> 05:19.611
NO, IT'S OKAY.

05:19.653 --> 05:21.113
IT'S JUST I HAVE CALLS

05:19.653 --> 05:21.113
TO MAKE --

05:21.155 --> 05:22.572
YOU KNOW,

05:21.155 --> 05:22.572
ALL THE PLANS WERE MADE.

05:22.614 --> 05:24.449
I'M A GREAT DIALER.

05:22.614 --> 05:24.449
WHAT DO YOU NEED?

05:24.491 --> 05:26.493
I HAVE TO CALL THE PRINTER

05:24.491 --> 05:26.493
AND THE CATERER

05:26.534 --> 05:30.497
AND THE PHOTOGRAPHER AND THE --

05:26.534 --> 05:30.497
AND THE CHURCH --

05:30.538 --> 05:33.667
THE PERFECT CHURCH THAT ONLY HAD

05:30.538 --> 05:33.667
ONE DATE AVAILABLE.

05:33.708 --> 05:36.711

11:02.870 --> 11:04.998
A PICTURE OF A FOOTBALL GAME.

11:05.039 --> 11:06.666
I KNOW.

11:06.707 --> 11:09.043
WELL, WAS THERE ONE WITH A GUY

11:06.707 --> 11:09.043
IN A HELMET HOLDING A BALL?

11:09.085 --> 11:10.253
BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY

11:09.085 --> 11:10.253

11:22.641 --> 11:24.100
LIKE "WE FORGOT TO GO"?

11:24.142 --> 11:26.685
AND THEN, OF COURSE,

11:24.142 --> 11:26.685
WHEN THE TEMPERAMENTAL ARTISTES

11:26.727 --> 11:28.563
FOUND OUT

11:33.360 --> 11:35.903

THAT NO PICTURE

15:39.021 --> 15:41.357
GRANDPARENTS LAST NIGHT.

15:41.399 --> 15:43.317
OH, SO NOW THEY'RE

15:41.399 --> 15:43.317
<i>MY</i> GRANDPARENTS.

15:43.359 --> 15:45.278
I TOLD THEM ABOUT YALE.

15:43.359 --> 15:45.278
GOOD. I'M GLAD.

15:45.319 --> 15:47.739
YOU'RE GLAD I TOLD THEM

15:45.319 --> 15:47.739
OR YOU'RE GLAD THEY KNOW?

15:45.319 --> 15:47.739
BOTH.

15:47.781 --> 15:49.532
YOU WANT TO KNOW

15:47.781 --> 15:49.532
HOW THEY TOOK IT?

15:47.781 --> 15:49.532
NO.

15:49.574 --> 15:51.033
THEY TOOK IT GREAT.

15:51.075 --> 15:53.994
MOM PRACTICALLY BROKE THE PHONE,

15:51.075 --> 15:53.994
SHE HUNG UP SO HARD,

15:54.036 --> 15:56.748
AND DAD -- WELL,

15:54.036 --> 15:56.748
DAD WAS SOLEMN, QUIET, SAD.

15:56.790 --> 15:57.791
IT WAS A HUGE SUCCESS.

15:57.832 --> 15:59.459
HERE'S HOW I SEE IT --

15:59.500 --> 16:02.253
YOU AND YOUR GRANDPARENTS

15:59.500 --> 16:02.253
ARE AT A HUGE CROSSROADS.

16:02.295 --> 16:04.714
THEY ARE THE BRIDGES

16:02.295 --> 16:04.714
OF MADISON COUNTY,

16:04.756 --> 16:06.215
AND YOU ARE MERYL STREEP.

16:06.257 --> 16:08.342
AS THE PAPER PAGES

16:06.257 --> 16:08.342
GO FLYING OFF THE CALENDAR.

16:08.384 --> 16:10.052
HEY, LISTEN TO ME.

16:08.384 --> 16:10.052
I'M SERIOUS HERE.

16:10.094 --> 16:12.931
I KNOW YOU AND

16:10.094 --> 16:12.931
YOUR GRANDPARENTS ARE PLAYING

16:12.972 --> 16:14.140
THE "WHO CAN FREEZE OUT

16:12.972 --> 16:14.140
WHO THE LONGEST?"

16:14.181 --> 16:15.809
WHICH I KNOW CAN BE FUN,

16:15.850 --> 16:17.894
BUT IF YOU EVER HOPE TO HAVE

16:15.850 --> 16:17.894
A RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM AGAIN,

16:17.936 --> 16:20.104
THEN SOMEONE NEEDS TO MAKE

16:17.936 --> 16:20.104
THE FIRST MOVE.

16:20.146 --> 16:22.649
I REMEMBER THE FIRST CHRISTMAS

16:20.146 --> 16:22.649
AFTER WE LEFT HARTFORD.

16:22.690 --> 16:24.400
WE WERE AT

16:22.690 --> 16:24.400
THE INDEPENDENCE INN,

16:24.442 --> 16:26.945
AND I GOT AN INVITATION TO THEIR

16:24.442 --> 16:26.945
ANNUAL CHRISTMAS PARTY,

16:26.986 --> 16:28.738
AND I DIDN'T GO,

16:28.780 --> 16:31.491
AND THAT ONE MOVE DEFINED

16:28.780 --> 16:31.491
OUR ENTIRE FUTURE RELATIONSHIP.

16:31.532 --> 16:33.952
I MEAN, IF I HAD GONE,

16:31.532 --> 16:33.952
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN AWFUL,

16:33.993 --> 16:36.496
BUT IT WOULD HAVE BROKEN

16:33.993 --> 16:36.496
THE ICE, AND MAYBE --

16:36.537 --> 16:38.456
AND I KNOW THIS IS

16:36.537 --> 16:38.456
A BIG "MAYBE" --

16:38.498 --> 16:40.708
BUT MAYBE WE WOULD HAVE BEEN

16:38.498 --> 16:40.708
A TAD CLOSER

16:40.750 --> 16:42.919
THAN WE ARE NOW

16:40.750 --> 16:42.919
OR COULD EVER HOPE TO BE.

16:42.961 --> 16:44.420
MAYBE, MAYBE NOT.

16:44.462 --> 16:46.297
I JUST KNOW HOW MUCH

16:44.462 --> 16:46.297
YOU LOVE YOUR GRANDPARENTS

16:46.339 --> 16:47.632
AND HOW IMPORTANT TO YOU

16:46.339 --> 16:47.632
IT WAS

16:47.674 --> 16:48.967
TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP

16:47.674 --> 16:48.967
WITH THEM,

16:49.008 --> 16:50.593
AND I DON'T WANT THE FACT

16:50.635 --> 16:52.762
THAT YOU INHERITED MY

16:50.635 --> 16:52.762
STUBBORNNESS TO SCREW THAT UP.

16:52.804 --> 16:54.430
OKAY, I HEAR YOU.

16:54.472 --> 16:56.933
DO YOU? BECAUSE MY SCARF IS

16:54.472 --> 16:56.933
SCREAMING AS LOUD AS IT CAN.

16:56.975 --> 16:58.309
I WILL THINK ABOUT IT.

16:58.351 --> 16:59.811
YOU HAVE TILL 6:45

16:58.351 --> 16:59.811
FRIDAY NIGHT,

16:59.853 --> 17:01.270
THEN WE'RE HAVING DINNER

16:59.853 --> 17:01.270
WITH THEM.

17:01.312 --> 17:02.772
WHAT?!

17:01.312 --> 17:02.772
I MADE THE PLANS

17:01.312 --> 17:02.772
LAST NIGHT.

17:02.814 --> 17:04.524
BUT --

17:02.814 --> 17:04.524
COME ON, RORY.

17:04.565 --> 17:06.734
FRIDAY NIGHT DINNERS,

17:04.565 --> 17:06.734
COCKTAILS,

17:06.776 --> 17:09.069
MOZART, MIND GAMES --

17:06.776 --> 17:09.069
GOOD TIMES.

17:09.111 --> 17:11.572
YEAH, BUT I'M NOT SO SURE

17:09.111 --> 17:11.572
ABOUT THIS.

17:11.614 --> 17:13.407
MOM ALREADY SAID

17:11.614 --> 17:13.407
SHE'S REALLY INTO THIS.

17:13.449 --> 17:14.617
SHE IS?

17:13.449 --> 17:14.617
YEAH.

17:14.659 --> 17:16.243
GRANDMA SAID

17:14.659 --> 17:16.243
SHE WAS INTO THIS?

17:16.285 --> 17:18.955
WELL, YOU KNOW,

17:16.285 --> 17:18.955
SHE DIDN'T SAY IT LIKE THAT,

17:18.997 --> 17:21.415
BUT SHE SAID, "OH!

17:18.997 --> 17:21.415
DINNER WITH RORY!

17:21.457 --> 17:23.793
"HOW DELIGHTFUL!

17:21.457 --> 17:23.793
WELL, SPIT-SPOT.

17:23.835 --> 17:25.336
ALERT THE CORGIS."

17:25.378 --> 17:28.047
YES, YES, SHE'S INTO IT.

17:25.378 --> 17:28.047
NOW, WHAT DO YOU SAY?

17:28.088 --> 17:30.049
OKAY.

17:28.088 --> 17:30.049
OKAY?

17:30.090 --> 17:33.219
DO YOU WANT TO WEAR MY SCARF

17:30.090 --> 17:33.219
TO DINNER? I KNOW YOU DO.

17:38.850 --> 17:40.267
BILL.

17:40.309 --> 17:42.228
WELL, LOOK WHO'S ALL DRESSED UP

17:40.309 --> 17:42.228
FOR THE BALL.

17:42.269 --> 17:44.355
I SENT IN MY STORY

17:42.269 --> 17:44.355
THIS MORNING.

17:44.397 --> 17:45.857
DID YOU GET IT?

17:44.397 --> 17:45.857
YEP.

17:45.899 --> 17:48.150
WELL, NO ONE CALLED ME IN

17:45.899 --> 17:48.150
FOR A FINAL EDIT,

17:48.192 --> 17:49.986
AND I NEED

17:48.192 --> 17:49.986
TO FINISH THIS UP NOW.

17:50.028 --> 17:51.237
I HAVE A DATE TONIGHT.

17:51.278 --> 17:53.489
SO, WHO IS THE COPY EDITOR

17:51.278 --> 17:53.489
ON MY PIECE?

17:53.531 --> 17:54.866
THAT WOULD BE MICHAEL.

17:54.908 --> 17:57.201
WELL, WHERE IS MICHAEL

17:54.908 --> 17:57.201
AND EVERYONE ELSE?

17:57.243 --> 17:58.578
WELL, LET'S SEE.

17:58.619 --> 17:59.913
THE SPORTS DEPARTMENT,

17:58.619 --> 17:59.913
CITY DEPARTMENT,

17:59.954 --> 18:01.414
ENTERTAINMENT DEPARTMENT,

18:01.455 --> 18:03.499
AND FEATURE DEPARTMENT,

18:01.455 --> 18:03.499
OTHER THAN YOU, HAVE QUIT.

18:03.541 --> 18:05.334
MICHAEL QUIT.

18:03.541 --> 18:05.334
SYLVIA QUIT. JONI QUIT.

18:05.376 --> 18:07.045
SHEILA'S SICK TONIGHT,

18:07.086 --> 18:08.880
BUT AS SOON AS SHE'S BETTER,

18:07.086 --> 18:08.880
SHE'S GOING TO QUIT.

18:08.922 --> 18:10.840
GREAT.

18:08.922 --> 18:10.840
OH, NOT DONE.

18:10.882 --> 18:13.760
THE SENIOR EDITOR QUIT.

18:10.882 --> 18:13.760
THE ENTIRE COPY DEPARTMENT QUIT.

18:13.801 --> 18:16.554
THE LITTLE FELLOW WHO BROUGHT

18:13.801 --> 18:16.554
AROUND SANDWICHES QUIT.

18:16.596 --> 18:18.765
OKAY, FINE, I GET IT.

18:16.596 --> 18:18.765
EVERYONE QUIT.

18:18.806 --> 18:20.058
NOT EVERYONE, BUT CLOSE.

18:20.099 --> 18:21.976
IT WAS QUITE AN EXODUS --

18:20.099 --> 18:21.976
VERY BIBLICAL.

18:22.018 --> 18:24.771
ALL THAT WAS MISSING WERE THE

18:22.018 --> 18:24.771
CABALA BRACELETS AND THE MATZO.

18:24.812 --> 18:26.773
WHATEVER.

18:24.812 --> 18:26.773
WE'LL FIGURE THAT OUT LATER.

18:26.814 --> 18:28.691
RIGHT NOW I JUST NEED

18:26.814 --> 18:28.691
TO FINISH MY ARTICLE,

18:28.733 --> 18:30.401
SO I GUESS YOU AND I

18:28.733 --> 18:30.401
CAN DO IT TOGETHER.

18:30.443 --> 18:32.403
WE COULD,

18:30.443 --> 18:32.403
BUT I QUIT, TOO.

18:32.445 --> 18:35.114
WHAT?

18:32.445 --> 18:35.114
RIGHT AFTER JONI.

18:32.445 --> 18:35.114
I BOWED OUT.

18:35.155 --> 18:37.700
I ACTUALLY BOWED --

18:35.155 --> 18:37.700
PHYSICALLY BOWED.

18:37.742 --> 18:39.368
THEN WHAT ARE YOU

18:37.742 --> 18:39.368
DOING HERE?

18:39.410 --> 18:41.621
I'M GOING TO HAVE

18:39.410 --> 18:41.621
A RINGSIDE SEAT

18:41.662 --> 18:43.539
FOR THE EVENT

18:41.662 --> 18:43.539
OF THE CENTURY.

18:43.581 --> 18:45.875
TONIGHT WILL BE

18:43.581 --> 18:45.875
THE FIRST TIME EVER

18:45.917 --> 18:47.543
IN THE HISTORY

18:45.917 --> 18:47.543
OF THE<i> YALE DAILY NEWS</i>

18:47.585 --> 18:48.962
THAT THE PAPER

18:47.585 --> 18:48.962
DOES NOT COME OUT.

18:49.003 --> 18:51.255
VERY NICE.

18:49.003 --> 18:51.255
D-DAY --

18:49.003 --> 18:51.255
THE PAPER CAME OUT.

18:51.297 --> 18:53.215
KENNEDY GETS SHOT --

18:51.297 --> 18:53.215
THE PAPER COMES OUT.

18:53.257 --> 18:55.635
BUT THREE MONTHS

18:53.257 --> 18:55.635
OF THE GELLER REIGN OF TERROR,

18:55.676 --> 18:57.971
AND THE WHOLE DAMN INSTITUTION

18:55.676 --> 18:57.971
COMES TUMBLING DOWN.

18:58.012 --> 18:59.847
YOU SUCK, BILL.

19:01.891 --> 19:05.311
PARIS?

19:06.896 --> 19:08.982
HOLY CRAP.

19:06.896 --> 19:08.982
I CAN'T TALK NOW.

19:09.023 --> 19:10.817
WHAT HAPPENED

19:09.023 --> 19:10.817
TO THIS PLACE?

19:10.858 --> 19:12.986
THERE'S NO AIR IN HERE

19:10.858 --> 19:12.986
OR LIGHT.

19:13.027 --> 19:15.780
WHERE ARE YOUR FIRE EXITS?

19:13.027 --> 19:15.780
YOU LOVE FIRE EXITS.

19:15.822 --> 19:17.782
NO ONE CAN WRITE A LEAD --

19:15.822 --> 19:17.782
NO ONE.

19:17.824 --> 19:20.242
PARIS, DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA

19:17.824 --> 19:20.242
WHAT'S GOING ON OUT THERE?

19:20.284 --> 19:21.786
I CAN'T THINK

19:20.284 --> 19:21.786
ABOUT THAT NOW.

19:21.828 --> 19:23.913
MORE THAN HALF THE STAFF

19:21.828 --> 19:23.913
HAS QUIT --

19:23.955 --> 19:26.415
AND THERE'S NO ONE

19:23.955 --> 19:26.415
OUT THERE WORKING.

19:26.457 --> 19:28.167
THERE'S NO ONE

19:26.457 --> 19:28.167
OUT THERE WORKING

19:28.208 --> 19:30.294
WHEN THERE'S PEOPLE

19:28.208 --> 19:30.294
OUT THERE WORKING.

19:30.336 --> 19:32.672
PARIS, THE PAPER'S

19:30.336 --> 19:32.672
NOT GONNA COME OUT.

19:32.713 --> 19:34.090
OF COURSE IT IS.

19:34.132 --> 19:35.800
HOW? NOTHING'S DONE.

19:34.132 --> 19:35.800
I'M WORKING ON IT.

19:35.842 --> 19:37.426
ALONE?

19:35.842 --> 19:37.426
I CAN DO IT ALONE.

19:37.468 --> 19:39.012
I'VE BEEN DOING IT ALONE

19:37.468 --> 19:39.012
FOR MONTHS.

19:39.053 --> 19:40.680
NO MAN IS AN ISLAND,

19:39.053 --> 19:40.680
BUT THIS WOMAN IS.

19:40.721 --> 19:43.516
BUT, PARIS --

19:40.721 --> 19:43.516
I'VE GOT IT

19:40.721 --> 19:43.516
ALL SCHEDULED OUT.

19:43.557 --> 19:44.851
AS LONG AS I STICK

19:43.557 --> 19:44.851
TO THE SCHEDULE,

19:44.892 --> 19:46.560
EVERYTHING'S

19:44.892 --> 19:46.560
GOING TO BE FINE.

19:46.602 --> 19:48.146
I'M FINISHING UP A REVIEW

19:48.187 --> 19:50.356
OF THE DRAMA CLUB'S PRODUCTION

19:48.187 --> 19:50.356
OF "SWEENEY TODD" NOW.

19:50.397 --> 19:52.900
THEN 9:30 TO 10:00,

19:50.397 --> 19:52.900
I'M GONNA FINALIZE THE LAYOUT.

19:52.942 --> 19:55.319
10:00 TO 11:00 -- COPY EDITING.

19:52.942 --> 19:55.319
11:00 TO 12:30 --

19:55.361 --> 19:56.904
LET ME SEE THAT.

19:56.946 --> 19:59.073
PARIS, THERE'S LIKE 100 HOURS

19:56.946 --> 19:59.073
OF WORK ON THIS

19:59.115 --> 20:01.200
AND 5 HOURS

19:59.115 --> 20:01.200
TILL THE PAPER COMES OUT.

20:01.241 --> 20:03.828
YOU BETTER GET BITTEN

20:01.241 --> 20:03.828
BY THAT RADIOACTIVE SPIDER

20:03.870 --> 20:05.579
PRETTY DAMN FAST HERE.

20:05.621 --> 20:08.332
I JUST HAVE TO STOP ALLOWING

20:05.621 --> 20:08.332
MYSELF TO BE DISTRACTED.

20:08.374 --> 20:09.458
PARIS!

20:09.500 --> 20:10.877
DON'T DISTRACT ME!

20:25.307 --> 20:27.768
OKAY, EVERYONE, LISTEN UP.

20:25.307 --> 20:27.768
WE HAVE WORK TO DO.

20:27.810 --> 20:29.979
YOU, T-SHIRT --

20:27.810 --> 20:29.979
YOU'RE DOING LAYOUT.

20:30.021 --> 20:33.149
AND, YOU, SAGGY PANTS --

20:30.021 --> 20:33.149
GET ALL THE HEELERS' NUMBERS,

20:33.191 --> 20:35.359
CALL THEM,

20:33.191 --> 20:35.359
AND TELL THEM TO GET IN HERE.

20:35.401 --> 20:36.944
THEY'VE JUST BEEN PROMOTED.

20:36.986 --> 20:39.405
AND I NEED SHEILA

20:36.986 --> 20:39.405
AND JONI'S NUMBERS A.S.A.P.

20:39.446 --> 20:43.117
COME ON, PEOPLE! MOVE!

20:39.446 --> 20:43.117
WE'VE GOT A PAPER TO GET OUT!

20:43.159 --> 20:47.246
I JUST THINK THAT IF MICHEL

20:43.159 --> 20:47.246
HAD SOMEBODY TO COME HOME TO,

20:47.287 --> 20:48.873
HE MIGHT GO HOME.

20:48.915 --> 20:50.457
OH, HE'S BEEN

20:48.915 --> 20:50.457
DRIVING ME CRAZY

20:50.499 --> 20:52.334
ABOUT TURNING THE STABLE

20:50.499 --> 20:52.334
INTO A SPA.

20:52.376 --> 20:55.046
WHAT WOULD WE DO

20:52.376 --> 20:55.046
WITH THE HORSES?

20:52.376 --> 20:55.046
WELL, WE'D WORK THEM IN.

20:55.088 --> 20:57.381
WE'D HAVE THE FIRST HOT-HOOF

20:55.088 --> 20:57.381
MASSAGE ON THE EAST COAST.

26:30.214 --> 26:31.589
I AM OUT OF HERE.

26:31.631 --> 26:33.633
INTERESTED

26:31.631 --> 26:33.633
IN SOME DESKING?

26:31.631 --> 26:33.633
I'M ON IT.

26:33.675 --> 26:36.678
COMPUTER CRASHED AGAIN.

26:33.675 --> 26:36.678
UNPLUG IT

26:33.675 --> 26:36.678
AND PLUG IT BACK IN.

26:36.720 --> 26:40.015
IF THAT DOESN'T WORK, CALL I.T.

26:36.720 --> 26:40.015
AND GET SOMEONE OVER HERE NOW.

26:40.057 --> 26:42.642
OH, MY GOD. OUR DATE.

26:40.057 --> 26:42.642
I'M SO SORRY.

26:42.684 --> 26:45.104
PARIS MELTED DOWN

26:42.684 --> 26:45.104
AND EVERYONE QUIT

26:45.145 --> 26:46.897
AND THE PAPER

26:45.145 --> 26:46.897
WASN'T GONNA COME OUT,

26:46.939 --> 26:48.690
AND I ONLY

26:46.939 --> 26:48.690
FOUND OUT ABOUT IT

26:48.732 --> 26:51.193
BECAUSE NO ONE CALLED ME

26:48.732 --> 26:51.193
TO CONFIRM THEY GOT MY STORY,

26:51.235 --> 26:52.736
SO I CALLED IN

26:51.235 --> 26:52.736
ALL THE HEELERS,

26:52.778 --> 26:54.612
AND I GOT SHEILA AND JONI

26:52.778 --> 26:54.612
TO COME IN,

26:54.654 --> 26:56.656
AND I CALLED PETE,

26:54.654 --> 26:56.656
WHO SAID HE WAS SICK,

26:56.698 --> 26:58.700
BUT I THREATENED HIS JOB,

26:56.698 --> 26:58.700
SO HE CAME IN,

26:58.742 --> 27:01.036
BUT HE WAS REALLY SICK,

26:58.742 --> 27:01.036
SO I JUST SENT HIM HOME.

27:01.078 --> 27:03.539
PLUS, THE PRINTERS ARE TRYING

27:01.078 --> 27:03.539
TO GIVE OUR TIME AWAY,

27:03.581 --> 27:05.416
THE COMPUTERS KEEP CRASHING,

27:05.458 --> 27:08.210
AND THEN THERE'S THE TINY LITTLE

27:05.458 --> 27:08.210
DETAIL OF NOTHING'S DONE.

27:08.252 --> 27:10.879
AND D-DAY, THE PAPER CAME OUT,

27:08.252 --> 27:10.879
AND I FORGOT.

27:10.921 --> 27:13.257
I'M SORRY.

27:10.921 --> 27:13.257
I CAN'T BELIEVE

27:10.921 --> 27:13.257
YOU DIDN'T CALL ME.

27:13.299 --> 27:14.800
I KNOW,

27:13.299 --> 27:14.800
BUT IT'S JUST PAPER STUFF.

27:14.841 --> 27:16.510
I KNOW.

27:14.841 --> 27:16.510
I'M ON THE PAPER.

27:16.552 --> 27:17.803
YOU HATE IT HERE.

27:17.844 --> 27:19.513
I KNOW THIS CRAP

27:17.844 --> 27:19.513
BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS.

27:19.555 --> 27:21.557
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DIDN'T EVEN

27:19.555 --> 27:21.557
THINK TO CALL ME.

27:21.599 --> 27:24.143
WELL, I'M SORRY. I JUST DIDN'T

27:21.599 --> 27:24.143
THINK YOU WERE INTERESTED.

27:24.184 --> 27:26.061
I GUESS YOU DON'T KNOW

27:24.184 --> 27:26.061
EVERYTHING, NOW, DO YOU?

27:26.103 --> 27:27.354
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT HERE?

27:27.396 --> 27:29.440
WELL, THIS IS AN ARTICLE

27:27.396 --> 27:29.440
ON GREENSPAN.

27:29.482 --> 27:32.692
HE GAVE AN INTERVIEW WITH ALL

27:29.482 --> 27:32.692
THIS TECHNICAL ECONOMIC JARGON.

27:32.734 --> 27:34.778
I KNOW THE JARGON.

27:32.734 --> 27:34.778
ARE THESE PROOFED?

27:34.820 --> 27:36.654
YEAH, BUT THEY'RE NOT

27:34.820 --> 27:36.654
TYPED IN YET.

27:36.696 --> 27:39.241
I'LL DO THAT.

27:36.696 --> 27:39.241
I TYPE 90 WORDS A MINUTE.

27:36.696 --> 27:39.241
YOU DO?

27:39.283 --> 27:41.243
YOU REALLY DID ONLY LIKE ME

27:39.283 --> 27:41.243
FOR MY LOOKS, HUH?

27:41.285 --> 27:43.745
HOW YOU DOING ON CONTENT?

27:41.285 --> 27:43.745
UH, STILL A LITTLE SHORT.

27:43.787 --> 27:46.499
I GOT A COUPLE STORIES BANKED

27:43.787 --> 27:46.499
THAT I DIDN'T GIVE PARIS.

27:46.540 --> 27:49.502
AND JUST REMEMBER,

27:46.540 --> 27:49.502
IF YOU STILL NEED MATERIAL,

27:49.543 --> 27:52.463
CANNIBALIZE EVERYTHING YOU

27:49.543 --> 27:52.463
HAVE READY FOR FRIDAY'S ISSUE.

27:52.505 --> 27:54.089
ROBBING PETER TO PAY PAUL.

27:54.131 --> 27:57.050
PETER'S ASKING FOR IT.

27:54.131 --> 27:57.050
SO, WHO DO YOU HAVE DESKING?

27:57.092 --> 27:58.302
BILL.

27:58.344 --> 28:00.262
I'D THROW SHEILA

27:58.344 --> 28:00.262
ON THERE WITH HIM.

28:00.304 --> 28:02.806
IT WILL HURT HIS EGO

28:00.304 --> 28:02.806
AND MAKE HIM WORK FASTER.

28:02.848 --> 28:04.850
AND GET THAT YO-YO

28:02.848 --> 28:04.850
OFF THE FLOOR.

28:04.891 --> 28:07.894
SOMEBODY'S GONNA

28:04.891 --> 28:07.894
BREAK THEIR NECK.

28:11.273 --> 28:13.359
I MEAN,

28:11.273 --> 28:13.359
CAN YOU BELIEVE SHE READS?

28:13.400 --> 28:15.235
I HAVE A KID WHO READS.

28:13.400 --> 28:15.235
CRAZY!

28:15.277 --> 28:18.322
SHE SAT THERE FOR HOURS DOING

28:15.277 --> 28:18.322
HER HOMEWORK -- GEOMETRY.

28:18.364 --> 28:19.781
THAT'S SOME CRAZY STUFF.

28:19.823 --> 28:21.950
I ACTUALLY BOUGHT A BOOK,

28:19.823 --> 28:21.950
"GEOMETRY FOR DUMMIES."

28:21.992 --> 28:23.452
I STASH IT IN THE KITCHEN

28:23.494 --> 28:26.372
AND RUN BACK THERE EVERY TIME

28:23.494 --> 28:26.372
SHE ASKS ME A QUESTION,

28:26.413 --> 28:28.748
BUT I CAN'T FIGURE OUT

28:26.413 --> 28:28.748
WHAT THE HELL IT SAYS.

28:28.790 --> 28:31.751
I MEAN, IT'S JUST THIS MESS OF

28:28.790 --> 28:31.751
WEIRD SYMBOLS AND SHAPES AND --

28:31.793 --> 28:34.171
I WONDER IF THERE'S

28:31.793 --> 28:34.171
ANOTHER BOOK I COULD GET.

28:34.213 --> 28:36.423
UM, "'GEOMETRY FOR DUMMIES'

28:34.213 --> 28:36.423
FOR DUMMIES"?

28:36.465 --> 28:37.424
YES, EXACTLY.

28:37.466 --> 28:38.676
LUKE, SHE HAS TEACHERS.

28:38.717 --> 28:40.177
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO

28:38.717 --> 28:40.177
IS NOD AND SMILE.

28:40.219 --> 28:42.137
THAT'S WHAT I DID

28:40.219 --> 28:42.137
WITH RORY.

28:42.179 --> 28:45.391
I JUST WANT HER TO, YOU KNOW,

28:42.179 --> 28:45.391
NOT BE EMBARRASSED I'M HER DAD.

28:45.432 --> 28:46.725
IMPOSSIBLE.

28:46.766 --> 28:48.352
WELL, STEP BY STEP --

28:48.394 --> 28:50.145
FIRST STEP, MAKING SURE

28:48.394 --> 28:50.145
SHE'S COMFORTABLE AROUND ME.

28:50.187 --> 28:52.231
SHE SURE SEEMS TO BE --

28:50.187 --> 28:52.231
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,

28:52.272 --> 28:55.234
'CAUSE SHE'S COMING HERE

28:52.272 --> 28:55.234
AND HANGING OUT AT THE DINER.

28:55.275 --> 28:57.528
SHE WOULDN'T DO THAT

28:55.275 --> 28:57.528
IF SHE WAS UNCOMFORTABLE.

28:57.570 --> 28:59.154
YEAH, WELL,

28:57.570 --> 28:59.154
SHE'S GONNA BE

28:59.196 --> 29:01.198
WITH THIS VILLAGE OF IDIOTS

28:59.196 --> 29:01.198
I LIVE IN.

29:01.240 --> 29:03.742
DO YOU KNOW TONIGHT, SHE COMES

29:01.240 --> 29:03.742
TO THE DINER, RIGHT?

29:03.783 --> 29:06.245
SHE'S SITTING AT THE COUNTER,

29:03.783 --> 29:06.245
DOING HER HOMEWORK THERE.

29:06.286 --> 29:08.997
I LOOK OVER AT THE SODA SHOPPE,

29:06.286 --> 29:08.997
AND THE WHOLE DAMN TOWN

29:09.039 --> 29:10.666
IS STARING THROUGH THE WINDOW

29:09.039 --> 29:10.666
AT US.

29:10.708 --> 29:12.376
NO!

29:10.708 --> 29:12.376
LIKE WE'RE MONKEYS

29:10.708 --> 29:12.376
IN A ZOO.

29:12.418 --> 29:13.919
I COULD HAVE

29:12.418 --> 29:13.919
KILLED THEM ALL.

29:13.960 --> 29:15.588
WHAT HAPPENED?

29:15.629 --> 29:17.423
SHE DIDN'T NOTICE ANYTHING.

29:15.629 --> 29:17.423
SHE WAS TOO BUSY STUDYING.

29:17.464 --> 29:19.717
I JUST COULDN'T BELIEVE

29:17.464 --> 29:19.717
THOSE PEOPLE.

29:19.758 --> 29:21.843
CAN'T THEY GET THAT THIS

29:19.758 --> 29:21.843
IS A PRIVATE THING,

29:21.885 --> 29:23.512
I'M TRYING TO GET

29:21.885 --> 29:23.512
TO KNOW MY KID?

29:23.554 --> 29:25.514
I MEAN, YOU'RE NOT ALL OVER ME

29:23.554 --> 29:25.514
ABOUT THIS.

29:25.556 --> 29:27.391

THANK YOU.

29:36.692 --> 29:38.444
DID WE VERIFY THE DEAN

29:36.692 --> 29:38.444

29:38.485 --> 29:40.153

29:57.879 --> 29:59.923
WOW! SO, THAT'S

29:57.879 --> 29:59.923
WHAT HARD WORK FEELS LIKE.

29:59.965 --> 30:01.883
APPARENTLY I'VE BEEN AVOIDING IT

29:59.965 --> 30:01.883
FOR A REASON.

30:01.925 --> 30:03.218
I'M IN.

30:08.890 --> 30:11.310

30:11.351 --> 30:12.478
I OWE YOU NOTHING.

30:12.519 --> 30:14.521

30:12.519 --> 30:14.521
FOR THE GREATER GOOD.

30:14.563 --> 30:15.939
FOR A FOOT MASSAGE.

30:47.429 --> 30:50.349
I HEAR THERE'S A PROBLEM

WITH OUR PRINTING TIME?

30:50.390 --> 30:52.601
UH-HUH.

30:50.390 --> 30:52.601
NO, I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND.

30:52.643 --> 30:54.561
THE FIRST THING I LEARNED

30:52.643 --> 30:54.561
FROM MY FATHER

30:54.603 --> 30:56.814
IS THAT THERE'S NO PAPER UNLESS

30:54.603 --> 30:56.814
IT GETS TO THE PRINTER ON TIME.

30:56.855 --> 30:58.398
HE IS QUITE A LEGEND,

30:56.855 --> 30:58.398
MY FATHER.

30:58.440 --> 31:00.317
I'D LOVE TO INTRODUCE YOU

30:58.440 --> 31:00.317
TO HIM SOMETIME.

31:00.359 --> 31:02.110
ANYWAY, RUSSELL,

31:00.359 --> 31:02.110
THE THING IS

31:02.152 --> 31:06.573
WE ACTUALLY SENT

31:02.152 --> 31:06.573
THE ISSUE TO YOU ALREADY.

31:06.615 --> 31:08.200
YES, AT LEAST

31:06.615 --> 31:08.200
15 MINUTES AGO.

31:08.241 --> 31:10.285
NOW, IF YOU'RE HAVING A PROBLEM

31:08.241 --> 31:10.285
WITH YOUR SERVER,

31:10.327 --> 31:12.037
WE SHOULDN'T BE PENALIZED

31:10.327 --> 31:12.037
FOR THAT, RIGHT?

31:12.078 --> 31:13.872
YEAH, IT SHOULD BE

31:12.078 --> 31:13.872
IN THE SYSTEM RIGHT NOW.

31:13.913 --> 31:15.541
SURE. GO CHECK.

31:15.582 --> 31:19.085
BUT BEFORE YOU DO, IF YOU COULD

31:15.582 --> 31:19.085
SPELL YOUR NAME FOR ME --

31:19.127 --> 31:21.463
I WANT TO HAVE

31:19.127 --> 31:21.463
THE CORRECT PRONUNCIATION

WHEN I SPEAK

31:21.505 --> 31:23.465

31:23.507 --> 31:25.925
UH-HUH, RUSSELL.

31:23.507 --> 31:25.925
DAMN! MY PEN BROKE.

31:25.967 --> 31:28.387
HOLD ON.

31:25.967 --> 31:28.387
I'M LOOKING FOR A PEN.

31:28.428 --> 31:32.391
I'M LOOKING FOR A PEN.

31:28.428 --> 31:32.391
LOOKING FOR A PEN.

31:32.432 --> 31:33.600

31:35.644 --> 31:39.189

38:12.874 --> 38:14.167
IN CAHOOTS WITH HIM,
