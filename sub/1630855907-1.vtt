00:27.648 --> 00:29.270
The
interview is being conducted by

00:29.270 --> 00:30.513
Agent Richard Friedman.

00:30.513 --> 00:33.378
The date is May 14th,
the time is 9:28 AM.

00:39.039 --> 00:40.937
Rose, I'm here to help.

00:43.836 --> 00:47.254
Why don't we just
start at the beginning.

02:51.240 --> 02:53.380
Rose, God damn
silent assassin,

02:53.380 --> 02:55.175
you scared me half to death.

02:55.175 --> 02:56.624
Happy birthday, Mom.

02:58.005 --> 02:59.558
Gosh, the big 4-0.

02:59.558 --> 03:00.801
It's the new 30.

03:02.251 --> 03:03.804
- Come here.
- Thank you, honey.

03:08.602 --> 03:10.259
All right, give me
those car keys, old lady.

03:10.259 --> 03:11.984
I'm gonna be late for work.

03:11.984 --> 03:13.917
You all packed and ready?

03:13.917 --> 03:16.092
We've got a good drive
ahead of us tomorrow.

03:17.197 --> 03:18.957
Kill me now!

03:18.957 --> 03:22.650
It's gonna be fun,
I love you, honey.

03:22.650 --> 03:25.205
Love you.

03:49.953 --> 03:53.371
Morning, sweetie,
how was work?

03:54.993 --> 03:56.650
Front desk, yes, sir.

03:56.650 --> 03:58.893
Front desk, no, sir.

03:58.893 --> 04:01.862
Front desk, oh, I'm sorry
to hear about that, sir.

04:01.862 --> 04:04.761
Oh, I'll clean the shit
off the floor, sir.

04:06.729 --> 04:07.833
When I finish writing
my memoir

04:07.833 --> 04:09.179
about eating shit with a smile

04:09.179 --> 04:10.733
you're getting an advanced copy.

04:14.702 --> 04:16.808
We're gonna have fun, let's go.

04:20.225 --> 04:21.675
Shit!

04:21.675 --> 04:23.677
- It's a sign.
- It's not a sign.

04:26.335 --> 04:27.267
Mom!

04:38.485 --> 04:39.831
No.

04:39.831 --> 04:42.212
You keep an open mind,
Rosie, it's all I'm asking.

04:42.212 --> 04:44.387
He's a great guy.
- Again.

04:50.117 --> 04:51.463
We're going on vacation.

04:54.397 --> 04:56.848
Water, sun, here we come.

04:56.848 --> 04:58.332
Oh God!

04:59.575 --> 05:02.371
♪ Tell me something that
I don't know ♪

05:02.371 --> 05:05.546
♪ Give me nothing
but love and hope ♪

05:05.546 --> 05:10.620
♪ I hope I can find
my paradise ♪

05:11.138 --> 05:14.866
♪ Been down under
and all I've seen ♪

05:14.866 --> 05:17.420
If you tease me about my
peach buzz, I swear to God.

05:18.732 --> 05:20.009
How much longer?

05:20.009 --> 05:22.839
We are here, honey, look
at this, it's beautiful.

05:24.496 --> 05:25.428
Beautiful.

05:30.191 --> 05:32.573
So what do you like
so much about this guy,

05:32.573 --> 05:34.748
besides the fact that he's rich?

05:34.748 --> 05:36.646
I don't care that he's rich.

05:36.646 --> 05:40.685
He's not actually, I like
that he's a gentleman.

05:43.412 --> 05:45.621
10-days stuck on a boat
with a gentleman

05:45.621 --> 05:47.105
I've never met before,

05:47.105 --> 05:50.833
and you've known for,
what, a month, six-weeks?

05:50.833 --> 05:53.353
Don't be such a teenager, please.

05:53.353 --> 05:56.425
This is exciting, we are
going on an adventure.

05:56.425 --> 05:57.805
Let's do it.

05:57.805 --> 05:59.359
I literally hate the water,
it's fucking terrifying.

05:59.359 --> 06:00.049
There he is.

06:02.948 --> 06:04.847
I've never seen him
in shorts before.

06:07.401 --> 06:08.713
Come on, let's go.

06:13.373 --> 06:14.788
Whoa!

06:14.788 --> 06:15.961
Let's do it.

06:15.961 --> 06:17.687
Okay, I'll be right there.

06:19.448 --> 06:21.450
Don't you go
backing out on me.

06:21.450 --> 06:24.384
I won't.

06:31.218 --> 06:32.081
Gross.

06:40.400 --> 06:41.953
Come on board, baby.

06:41.953 --> 06:43.541
This is beautiful.

06:43.541 --> 06:46.233
Here, take a seat, I
want you to see something.

06:46.233 --> 06:47.476
Okay.

06:47.476 --> 06:49.512
So this is the course
I've chartered.

06:49.512 --> 06:52.722
These are the wave points,
but that here is Bermuda.

06:52.722 --> 06:54.137
By next Tuesday,

06:54.137 --> 06:56.623
we'll be lounging on the beach
with a belly full of rum.

06:57.520 --> 06:59.142
Hey, come check this out,
I wanna show you down here.

06:59.142 --> 07:01.524
You know, I'm just
gonna wait here for Rose,

07:01.524 --> 07:03.215
so you don't have to
do this twice.

07:03.215 --> 07:05.217
Is she okay?

07:05.217 --> 07:09.601
She's great, she's just
stubborn like her mom.

07:10.568 --> 07:12.432
Scared to death of anything new.

07:12.432 --> 07:13.778
This will be good for her.

07:55.060 --> 07:57.028
I'm okay, thank you.

07:57.028 --> 07:58.443
That's very kind.

08:10.455 --> 08:11.421
Got it!

08:11.421 --> 08:12.526
Hey, you good?

08:12.526 --> 08:14.424
Yeah, I'm good.

08:14.424 --> 08:16.565
Saw that dude checking you out.

08:16.565 --> 08:17.600
What'd he say to you?

08:17.600 --> 08:19.533
He's just making conversation.

08:19.533 --> 08:22.294
He wanted to know where I
was headed looking this good.

08:23.744 --> 08:27.196
We have options, you don't
need to settle, just saying.

08:28.508 --> 08:32.235
Hey guys, Rose, so
nice to finally meet you.

08:33.133 --> 08:34.134
Yeah.

08:34.134 --> 08:35.687
Look at this beautiful boat.

08:38.310 --> 08:39.415
Who's Annalisa?

08:40.105 --> 08:41.555
I don't know.

08:41.555 --> 08:44.351
Bought her second-hand, bad
luck to change the name.

08:45.870 --> 08:46.733
Well, come on.

08:47.630 --> 08:48.804
Let's go, honey.

08:58.952 --> 09:00.298

09:14.519 --> 09:15.934
Need some help us here stat.

09:18.799 --> 09:20.076
You're silly.

09:21.733 --> 09:24.771
First mate Rose, can't
sleep all day here.

09:24.771 --> 09:26.393
Your captain could use a hand.

09:27.359 --> 09:28.982
Do you know how to tie
a double slip reef knot?

09:28.982 --> 09:29.983
No.

09:29.983 --> 09:31.225
I'm pretty sure you do,

09:31.225 --> 09:32.502
you know how to tie your shoes,
don't you?

09:32.502 --> 09:33.745
Yeah.

09:33.745 --> 09:36.886
Grab some rope from
underneath the laptop.

09:36.886 --> 09:38.060
It's in the storage.

09:39.199 --> 09:40.856
I'll teach you some more knots.

09:43.755 --> 09:44.791
Rope is called line.

09:46.413 --> 09:47.897
Rope is called line.

09:47.897 --> 09:52.488
Great teacher.

10:06.019 --> 10:09.401
♪ Happy birthday to you

10:10.851 --> 10:14.717
♪ Happy birthday
- Okay, okay.

10:15.822 --> 10:17.099
What's with
the tombstone?

10:17.099 --> 10:19.239
Better to be over
the hill than under it.

10:19.239 --> 10:21.103
Sure, I'm going for it.

10:21.103 --> 10:22.242
Go for it.

10:23.553 --> 10:24.900
Ah, sweetie.

10:24.900 --> 10:26.936
- Happy birthday, Mom.
- I love you.

10:26.936 --> 10:27.765
I love you.

10:27.765 --> 10:28.766
What about me?

10:30.802 --> 10:32.873
Come here you.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.433
Me and Rose have been two
ships passing in the night

10:41.433 --> 10:42.676
for the last month.

10:42.676 --> 10:44.126
I've been working a swing
shift at the restaurant,

10:44.126 --> 10:45.852
and she's been on graveyard
at the hotel.

10:45.852 --> 10:48.924
So only time we're both home
is when one of us is sleeping.

10:49.821 --> 10:51.098
I miss you, honey.

10:51.098 --> 10:52.513
I miss you too.

10:54.792 --> 10:56.483
How do you like working
at the hotel?

10:57.795 --> 10:59.486
I absolutely fucking hate it.

10:59.486 --> 11:01.764
Okay, let's just say
she doesn't have my flare

11:01.764 --> 11:03.317
for customer service [laughs].

11:05.423 --> 11:07.218
Got a good poker face.

11:07.218 --> 11:08.702
That is an
excellent bowline.

11:08.702 --> 11:11.532
Rose is an excellent
student, always has been.

11:12.430 --> 11:13.534
You want another piece?

11:13.534 --> 11:14.432
I would love
another piece.

11:14.432 --> 11:16.123
He always orders two pieces.

11:16.123 --> 11:19.230
Your mom tells me about
college, that's so cool.

11:19.230 --> 11:23.959
Does that mean you'll be
leaving the nest in the fall?

11:25.201 --> 11:26.686
No, I'm going to defer
one year

11:26.686 --> 11:29.102
so I can work and save money.

11:29.102 --> 11:30.690
So one more year in the nest.

11:30.690 --> 11:32.968
Smart and beautiful.

11:32.968 --> 11:34.659
I wonder where she gets it from.

11:36.005 --> 11:39.353
Oh, hey, I have presents.

11:40.630 --> 11:41.493
That's for you.

11:43.219 --> 11:46.602
And this, oh, no,
that's for us for later.

11:48.708 --> 11:49.501
I love gifts.

11:50.468 --> 11:52.642
And just like I said
in the note,

11:52.642 --> 11:54.161
I'm really happy
that you're with us,

11:54.161 --> 11:57.544
and I'm happy that you get to
experience my love of sailing.

11:58.510 --> 11:59.615
Sweetie.

11:59.615 --> 12:01.617
- Who knows.
- Rosie!

12:01.617 --> 12:03.826
Maybe one day you'll love
it just as much as I do.

12:03.826 --> 12:06.208
That is a marlin spike.

12:06.208 --> 12:09.729
It'll untangle any knot if you
ever find yourself in a jam.

12:12.352 --> 12:13.871
Thank you.

12:13.871 --> 12:14.837
I love it.

12:14.837 --> 12:15.735
Great.

12:19.704 --> 12:21.637
- So you're a cop?
- Used to be.

12:22.431 --> 12:23.950
What are you now?

12:23.950 --> 12:25.537
Private security consultant.

12:28.471 --> 12:31.854
It looks like I'm needed
topside, and I could use a hand.

12:31.854 --> 12:33.753
You can't stay down here
all day, kiddo.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.755
Yeah, go help him,
I'll clean up.

12:38.378 --> 12:41.761
You two are cute,
my phone is crappy.

12:43.935 --> 12:44.867
Try this again.

12:45.937 --> 12:48.526
Hey, honey, Derek, just
gimme a little wave.

12:48.526 --> 12:51.460
I love that.

12:53.634 --> 12:54.635
Video mode.

12:56.085 --> 12:57.604
Okay, we need to jibe.

12:57.604 --> 13:00.365
Can you feel which way
the wind is blowing?

13:00.365 --> 13:03.610
- We are waiting on dolphins.
-  That way.

13:03.610 --> 13:07.234
So we need to turn the bow
so the wind shifts sides.

13:07.234 --> 13:08.857
Oh my God, I love it.

13:11.618 --> 13:14.241
- Mom, Mom!
-  Oh shit!

13:14.241 --> 13:15.898
Help! Derek!

13:15.898 --> 13:17.589
Go down to starboard storage,

13:17.589 --> 13:20.454
grab a blanket and the
first aid kit, go down.

13:20.454 --> 13:23.078
Grab on the horseshoe,
baby!

13:31.293 --> 13:32.950
Hang on tight,
I'm pulling you in.

13:35.642 --> 13:37.264
Give me your hand,

13:37.264 --> 13:39.542
there we go.

13:39.542 --> 13:40.889
Are you hurt?

13:40.889 --> 13:44.202
I'm okay.

13:45.963 --> 13:47.827
It's okay, you okay?

13:47.827 --> 13:50.312
Yeah, sweetie, I lost
your phone out there.

13:50.312 --> 13:52.210
Well, I don't care.

13:52.210 --> 13:53.902
- You love that phone?
- No, it's okay.

13:53.902 --> 13:57.043
- I'm gonna get you a new one.
- It's okay, it's okay.

13:58.872 --> 14:00.115
Well, at least now
I know what to do

14:00.115 --> 14:02.151
in case of an emergency.

14:03.497 --> 14:05.051
Wasn't that an emergency?

14:05.051 --> 14:05.983
I'm okay, honey.

14:07.812 --> 14:10.850
Hey, sweetie, I told you this
was gonna be an adventure.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.679
Okay,
no more adventures.

14:14.715 --> 14:15.578
What's that?

14:22.896 --> 14:24.691
-  You need help, honey?

14:24.691 --> 14:27.418
No, you're on vacation,
it's no big deal.

14:28.798 --> 14:30.007
Just taking precautions.

14:31.111 --> 14:33.010
Might get a little rough,

14:33.010 --> 14:35.805
but that's about it.

14:35.805 --> 14:37.877
And it's not gonna come to this
but there's a life raft

14:37.877 --> 14:38.912
in the cockpit,

14:38.912 --> 14:41.156
and there's three
life vests here.

14:45.505 --> 14:48.059
How far away from home
are we, can we just go back?

14:49.371 --> 14:51.373
It's fine, really,
it's fine.

14:53.823 --> 14:55.308
It's okay, Mom.

14:55.308 --> 14:58.000
The wind shifted, they came
out of nowhere, but it's fine.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.415
Everything's gonna be fine.

15:03.005 --> 15:04.282
Okay.

15:50.742 --> 15:53.090
Oh my God,
you are so fucking sexy.

15:54.954 --> 15:55.851
Oh my God.

16:30.506 --> 16:32.646
Hey, honey,
come and join me.

16:36.512 --> 16:37.375
Come sit.

16:43.588 --> 16:45.073
Breakfast of champions.

16:45.073 --> 16:48.145
Yeah, decided I'm gonna
make it a birthday week.

16:49.249 --> 16:50.112
Doing okay?

16:52.839 --> 16:54.979
What happened to the storm?

16:54.979 --> 16:56.463
It passed right on by.

16:56.463 --> 16:58.638
We didn't wanna wake you, you
didn't seem bothered by it,

16:58.638 --> 17:00.053
Miss cool as a cucumber.

17:02.193 --> 17:04.609
Here I thought you were
afraid of the water,

17:04.609 --> 17:06.611
I was absolutely
shitting my pants

17:06.611 --> 17:08.475
imagining all of us in
that little lifeboat

17:08.475 --> 17:10.132
out there in the ocean.

17:10.132 --> 17:11.168
You want a bite?

17:12.376 --> 17:15.206
No, I didn't sleep at all.

17:18.899 --> 17:20.418
You want a cigarette?

17:20.418 --> 17:21.316
No.

17:22.731 --> 17:25.320
Rosie, I know you smoke.

17:25.320 --> 17:28.081
Yeah, I didn't want
to smoke in front of you

17:28.081 --> 17:29.669
so you'd quit.

17:29.669 --> 17:32.948
Let me smoke, life is
not as short as they say,

17:32.948 --> 17:34.708
and I need my cigarette breaks.

17:38.574 --> 17:40.266
Just love it out here,
don't you?

17:41.370 --> 17:42.854
Absolutely fucking not.

17:45.892 --> 17:49.206
Come on, it's gorgeous,
smell that air.

18:02.391 --> 18:04.186
I'm sorry I couldn't
give you more.

18:06.361 --> 18:10.192
I tried my best, but...

18:14.231 --> 18:16.095
Mom, shut up,
you're incredible.

18:16.095 --> 18:17.406
You're the best mom ever.

18:22.342 --> 18:24.448
I don't want you to
end up like me.

18:29.038 --> 18:30.316
Hello.

18:31.075 --> 18:32.214
I love you, baby.

18:32.214 --> 18:33.905
Smells like bacon.

18:33.905 --> 18:34.803
Ha-ha!

18:36.460 --> 18:37.495
Where's the bacon?

18:38.358 --> 18:40.567
Oh, every time Derek
would come in the diner

18:40.567 --> 18:42.811
in his uniform, I say,
"Smells like bacon."

18:44.088 --> 18:45.503
I think that's what
won him over.

18:45.503 --> 18:47.091
That's exactly what
won me over,

18:47.091 --> 18:48.644
that and your great ass.

18:49.369 --> 18:50.577
Get outta here.

18:51.682 --> 18:53.787
Derek, why do you have
an assault rifle?

18:54.616 --> 18:55.444
A what?

18:55.444 --> 18:56.342
It's for work.

18:57.446 --> 18:58.930
It's an AR15, isn't it?

18:59.759 --> 19:01.140
It is, it is.

19:02.762 --> 19:04.488
Does it bother you
that I have it?

19:05.799 --> 19:06.662
No,

19:07.663 --> 19:08.768
I wanna shoot it.

19:11.150 --> 19:13.290
Okay, this is
the ready position.

19:14.739 --> 19:17.259
Safety's on, my finger
is not on the trigger,

19:17.259 --> 19:20.055
it's outside the trigger guard
until I'm ready to shoot.

19:26.130 --> 19:29.064
Not on the shoulder, inside a
little more, a little higher.

19:30.479 --> 19:31.377
That's perfect.

19:32.240 --> 19:34.449
Now bring the sights up
to your eyes,

19:34.449 --> 19:37.106
not your eyes down
to the sights.

19:37.106 --> 19:39.005
Your head, neck,
and spine straight.

19:42.319 --> 19:46.185
Look at that, kids these days,
we should be afraid of them.

19:47.703 --> 19:50.292
Your off grip hand moving
as far forward as you can.

19:50.292 --> 19:51.776
Right, you're gonna find
the safety over here,

19:51.776 --> 19:55.332
you can release it just by...

19:55.332 --> 19:56.229
You shot before!

19:57.126 --> 19:59.715
No, I watch a lot of
action movies.

20:00.716 --> 20:02.580
Well, it looks like
you're a natural.

20:04.064 --> 20:05.480
See Mom, I'm a natural.

20:05.480 --> 20:06.998
You wanna try, hun?

20:06.998 --> 20:07.896
Certainly not.

20:08.862 --> 20:11.002
I'd prefer if you put
that thing away.

20:11.900 --> 20:15.421
It's just not how I wanna
spend my vacation, sweetie.

20:15.421 --> 20:17.940
You know her daddy
was a soldier, right?

20:17.940 --> 20:20.011
It is bad enough
that she likes to fight,

20:20.011 --> 20:21.772
I don't want her
shooting guns too.

20:23.222 --> 20:24.602
You like to fight, you train?

20:25.569 --> 20:26.432
Yeah.

20:28.088 --> 20:29.020
One more, Mom.

20:30.712 --> 20:31.713
Okay, one more.

20:32.921 --> 20:37.581
All right, stay nice and
tight, keep those elbows in.

20:38.029 --> 20:40.031
Better to negotiate
hallways and doors,

20:40.031 --> 20:42.344
or bump a team member
coming around a corner.

21:41.438 --> 21:43.129
Rosie, come here.

21:45.925 --> 21:47.409
Sweetie, come here.

21:50.619 --> 21:52.725
Maritime law, you only
have to be 19 to drink.

21:52.725 --> 21:55.210
Well, she's not much
of a drinker.

21:55.210 --> 21:57.385
Your grandma
will be so disappointed.

21:57.385 --> 21:59.766
We're Scottish, Grandma
was a cleaning lady.

21:59.766 --> 22:02.113
I'm pretty sure she
didn't drink champagne.

22:02.113 --> 22:03.425
You know what?

22:03.425 --> 22:05.082
We should have Derek break
out the whiskey then.

22:05.082 --> 22:07.360
Oh, I got plenty of whiskey.

22:07.360 --> 22:11.122
God, I love it here,
I never wanna go home.

22:11.122 --> 22:12.123
Well, let's not.

22:12.123 --> 22:13.504
Let's keep sailing forever.

22:16.162 --> 22:17.336
Can we go swimming?

22:17.336 --> 22:20.235
No, we have fair winds
and following seas.

22:20.235 --> 22:22.479
Okay,
that sounds kind of poetic.

22:23.963 --> 22:26.345
It is.

22:37.563 --> 22:40.082
Rosie,
come dance with us?

22:40.082 --> 22:41.256
-  Come on, Rose.
- Fuck off.

22:41.256 --> 22:42.740
Don't be a pooper.

22:42.740 --> 22:45.329
Sweetie, I miss you,
join us, you're missing out.

23:25.645 --> 23:26.715
Who are they?

23:26.715 --> 23:27.958
I don't know.

23:29.166 --> 23:31.996
Stand off, stand off.

23:33.550 --> 23:35.344
Go back,
get to the back.

23:35.344 --> 23:37.416
-  Derek!
-  Shit!

23:37.416 --> 23:39.348
Go on, go, go!

23:39.348 --> 23:40.419
Who are you,
what are you doing?

23:40.419 --> 23:41.489
Shut up,
where is it?

23:41.489 --> 23:43.422
What is going on,
Derek,

23:43.422 --> 23:45.354
what are they talking about?
-  Shut up.

23:45.354 --> 23:46.563
I have no
fucking idea.

23:46.563 --> 23:47.909
What do you want?

23:47.909 --> 23:49.048
I don't know
what you're talking about.

23:51.499 --> 23:53.328
-  Larry, shut her up.
-  Yeah, I'm on it.

23:53.328 --> 23:54.433
What are you doing?

23:54.433 --> 23:55.503
Don't you
fucking hurt her.

23:55.503 --> 23:56.676
Sit down, bitch.

23:56.676 --> 23:58.713
I don't understand.

23:58.713 --> 24:00.197
Sit the fuck down.

24:00.197 --> 24:01.474
Derek, do something.

24:02.406 --> 24:03.442
Do something!

24:04.270 --> 24:05.409
Del,
get her in line.

24:05.409 --> 24:06.548
What are you doing?

24:06.548 --> 24:08.239
Get the fuck away from me.

24:09.102 --> 24:10.897
Leave her alone.

24:10.897 --> 24:12.278
Where are you going?

24:12.278 --> 24:14.211
Now, tell me, where is it?

24:14.211 --> 24:15.695
There's nothing here.

24:15.695 --> 24:18.560
Hide, hide.

24:18.560 --> 24:20.010
I love you.

24:20.010 --> 24:21.045
Go.

24:21.045 --> 24:22.461
-  Get her up.
- Go!

24:24.048 --> 24:26.672
No, no, no, get off me!

24:28.674 --> 24:30.296
Captain,
it's all clear.

24:32.298 --> 24:35.094
What's done
is done, where is it?

24:35.094 --> 24:36.613
I don't know
what you're talking about.

24:36.613 --> 24:37.683
Really?

24:40.237 --> 24:41.514
Okay.

24:41.514 --> 24:43.205
No, don't do it.

24:45.587 --> 24:47.347
-  Find it.

24:50.454 --> 24:52.111
I'm
gonna check the front cabin.

24:52.111 --> 24:53.492
I'll look back here.

24:59.567 --> 25:00.464
Found it.

25:01.327 --> 25:02.224
It's all there?

25:03.502 --> 25:05.055
Oh yeah, we're good.

25:06.677 --> 25:10.060
That bitch sure had a set
of pipes on her, didn't she?

25:10.060 --> 25:11.717
You should have kept her
and started a cover band.

25:17.446 --> 25:19.310
Throw one downstairs.

29:56.242 --> 30:00.729
Hello, hello!

30:00.729 --> 30:01.627
Help me!

30:03.249 --> 30:05.010
I am gonna bring you
around back.

30:42.426 --> 30:43.462
Okay.

30:50.987 --> 30:53.541
What do I do?

30:54.473 --> 30:55.992
Radio for help.

30:55.992 --> 30:57.579
I can't, the radio's dead.

30:59.478 --> 31:00.548
Alma!

31:00.548 --> 31:02.205
She's dead,
you fucking let her die.

31:06.002 --> 31:07.141
What do I do?

31:07.969 --> 31:09.074
Start the gas, get the sail.

31:12.111 --> 31:14.873
The electrical system's
fried, the sail's burnt off.

31:20.119 --> 31:20.982
What do I do?

31:32.062 --> 31:32.925
What are these?

31:35.065 --> 31:36.722
Useless.

31:36.722 --> 31:38.448
There's a spare jib
under the AR.

31:38.448 --> 31:39.828
Okay, then what?

31:39.828 --> 31:42.279
Get it up the mast.

31:43.246 --> 31:44.109
How?

31:45.351 --> 31:46.214
Climb,

31:47.871 --> 31:48.734
climb.

32:18.246 --> 32:23.148
Fuck!

32:28.498 --> 32:29.395
Yes!

33:28.592 --> 33:29.869
Rose!

33:34.253 --> 33:35.254
What do you need?

33:35.254 --> 33:37.325
Get the first aid kit.

33:50.373 --> 33:53.583
You gotta clean the wound
and pack it.

33:58.967 --> 34:00.521
Clean it first.

34:00.521 --> 34:02.074
Who were those men?

34:02.074 --> 34:04.870
Just get the
gauze and pack the wound.

34:04.870 --> 34:06.251
Who were those men?

34:07.631 --> 34:08.943
Who were those men?

34:08.943 --> 34:10.048
I don't know.

34:13.327 --> 34:16.364
Gotta get the motors
going, bypass the electron.

34:18.021 --> 34:20.230
The starter,
is it like a car starter?

34:24.579 --> 34:25.442
Is it?

34:26.754 --> 34:27.617
Oh god.

34:28.687 --> 34:31.690
Okay, are you the starter?

34:45.290 --> 34:46.739
Well, fuck!

34:56.266 --> 34:57.129
Fuck!

37:56.101 --> 37:57.309
I hope you tied a
better knot on the sail

37:57.309 --> 37:58.379
than you did on me.

38:00.036 --> 38:01.244
The patch is not
gonna hold in there,

38:01.244 --> 38:02.383
we need to find land.

38:03.557 --> 38:04.799
You know them.

38:04.799 --> 38:06.663
Why did you lie about
not knowing those men?

38:06.663 --> 38:09.942
They're monsters, Rose,
the less you know the better.

38:11.737 --> 38:14.913
I need to get the engine
started, I could use a hand.

38:14.913 --> 38:16.086
Can we just go back?

38:16.086 --> 38:17.743
We haven't been sailing
for that long.

38:19.089 --> 38:19.918
Why not?

38:20.988 --> 38:22.886
Because the current
runs up the east coast,

38:22.886 --> 38:24.681
and we need to stay
with the current.

38:25.924 --> 38:28.375
If you can put the knife
down now, Rosie.

38:28.375 --> 38:30.100
Only my mom can call me Rosie.

38:31.101 --> 38:32.310
Okay.

38:32.310 --> 38:34.795
Can we just shoot a
flare when it gets dark?

38:34.795 --> 38:35.934
You see a ship?

38:35.934 --> 38:37.245
No.

38:37.245 --> 38:39.765
You can only see a flare
for three to five-miles.

38:40.594 --> 38:42.285
Okay, this is us more or less.

38:43.459 --> 38:44.494
This here is Bermuda.

38:46.082 --> 38:48.084
Nothing else around us.

38:48.084 --> 38:51.052
No, we miss it, we're fucked.

38:51.052 --> 38:52.778
We run into weather,
we're fucked.

38:58.301 --> 39:00.268
You're gonna need to crank it
to get the engine going,

39:00.268 --> 39:03.548
but we gotta be synced-up
perfectly or it won't turn over.

39:04.894 --> 39:06.240
- This good?
- Wait, yeah, a little faster.

39:06.240 --> 39:07.897
And I'm gonna flip the
decompression lever.

39:07.897 --> 39:09.623
Go crank, crank it.

39:09.623 --> 39:10.727
Ready, okay.

39:10.727 --> 39:13.730
And...

39:13.730 --> 39:15.353
All right, go, crank it.

39:15.353 --> 39:17.078
Okay.

39:17.078 --> 39:18.356
Ready?

39:20.772 --> 39:21.738
Fuck, yeah!

40:28.840 --> 40:30.082
Shit!

40:31.118 --> 40:32.740
Stay in the cockpit all night.

40:34.086 --> 40:35.329
Keep it northeast.

40:38.677 --> 40:39.540
Wait,

40:43.717 --> 40:45.097
I'm sorry about your mom.

41:41.222 --> 41:42.983
I made that for you.

41:48.644 --> 41:50.991
You think I can
get my knife back?

41:50.991 --> 41:53.338
No.

41:53.338 --> 41:56.134
You know I gave that
necklace to your mom.

41:56.134 --> 41:58.239
It's impossible,
she's had it for years.

41:58.239 --> 42:00.725
I've known her
for years.

42:00.725 --> 42:02.761
She started dating you
like a month ago.

42:02.761 --> 42:04.487
I've been trying to
court your mom

42:04.487 --> 42:06.593
eating that shitty diner food

42:06.593 --> 42:08.526
since you were in middle school.

42:10.010 --> 42:13.013
I almost gave up after the
thousandth time I walked in

42:13.013 --> 42:14.877
and she said,
"Smells like bacon."

42:16.810 --> 42:18.294
She was tough.

42:18.294 --> 42:19.191
As nails.

42:21.055 --> 42:23.092
I wanted her to have
a proper funeral.

42:25.163 --> 42:27.096
Not just gonna
roll her into the ocean.

42:29.961 --> 42:32.688
We made some
good progress last night.

42:32.688 --> 42:33.723
And just keep it up.

42:41.835 --> 42:43.077
What is it?

42:43.077 --> 42:45.597
Wish we had more sail,
that jib isn't enough.

42:51.810 --> 42:53.018
Will you turn
the micrometre drum

42:53.018 --> 42:54.295
a little to the left for me.

42:54.295 --> 42:55.711
It's that little knob there.

42:56.643 --> 42:58.576
Yeah, stop.

43:02.441 --> 43:03.581
Where's Polaris?

43:06.618 --> 43:10.760
That is the Big Dipper,
so that there is Polaris.

43:13.073 --> 43:15.593
After some math that's
gonna tell us where we are.

43:22.013 --> 43:23.877
Fuck!

43:23.877 --> 43:24.809
Fuck!

43:27.121 --> 43:28.226
What's wrong?

43:28.226 --> 43:29.676
We're going the wrong
fucking way.

43:29.676 --> 43:31.022
Why?

43:31.022 --> 43:33.093
We're headed into the
fucking Atlantic, fuck!

43:33.093 --> 43:34.612
Well, if we're going
the wrong way,

43:34.612 --> 43:35.716
we can just change directions.

43:35.716 --> 43:37.166
We can't change directions,

43:37.166 --> 43:39.513
the current is too
fucking strong.

43:39.513 --> 43:43.275
We're fucked, okay,
we missed our chance.

43:43.275 --> 43:44.622
We're fucked!

43:46.624 --> 43:48.764
Ah, Jesus Christ.

43:52.906 --> 43:55.529
Fuck!

43:55.529 --> 43:57.496
Jesus fucking Christ,

43:58.497 --> 44:01.052
can't fucking believe this!

44:01.052 --> 44:01.949
Fuck!

44:49.928 --> 44:50.895
Can you just go?

44:50.895 --> 44:51.861
No.

44:53.000 --> 44:55.485
Well, I wanna stay with
my mom.

44:55.485 --> 44:58.350
I need you to row,
I only have one arm.

44:59.524 --> 45:00.387
Come on, Rose.

45:05.323 --> 45:06.600
Come on, you can do this.

45:10.052 --> 45:11.536
Put that oar together, okay.

45:22.961 --> 45:23.824
Fuck!

45:30.486 --> 45:35.663
No!

45:36.043 --> 45:37.010
Help, help!

45:38.183 --> 45:39.184
Help!

45:39.184 --> 45:41.186
Pull the cord.

45:41.186 --> 45:43.879
Pull the cord, inflate the vest.

46:11.941 --> 46:12.804
Come on.

46:17.222 --> 46:18.223
Come on.

46:20.536 --> 46:21.571
Ah, come on!

46:23.194 --> 46:23.815
Come on!

48:38.777 --> 48:39.640
Derek!

48:45.853 --> 48:46.716
Hey,

48:47.959 --> 48:48.926
come drink,

48:49.892 --> 48:51.480
this water's fresh.

49:05.287 --> 49:07.496
We gotta finish this loop.

49:12.501 --> 49:14.054
Okay.

49:14.054 --> 49:17.437
What does your tattoo mean,
a knife through a rose?

49:17.437 --> 49:19.094
It's a tagger.

49:19.094 --> 49:22.373
What's it mean,
it's on your AR too?

49:23.546 --> 49:25.755
Means you're ready to
fight, ready to kill,

49:25.755 --> 49:26.791
whatever, whatever,

49:28.137 --> 49:30.174
even something
as delicate as a rose.

49:32.486 --> 49:33.936
Were you in the military?

49:36.249 --> 49:37.112
No.

49:40.667 --> 49:41.840
What's the plan here?

49:44.636 --> 49:45.499
Derek?

49:48.019 --> 49:50.435
Let's not talk, okay, let's
just conserve our energy.

50:05.519 --> 50:08.902
Sorry.

50:17.290 --> 50:20.189
Hey, be careful,
there's coral here.

50:21.018 --> 50:22.916
It'll tear the bottom
of this thing up.

50:22.916 --> 50:25.229
Here, eat,

50:26.713 --> 50:28.025
we need to get our strength up

50:28.025 --> 50:30.234
if we're gonna make it back
to the boat before dark.

50:30.234 --> 50:31.511
What?

50:31.511 --> 50:33.306
Maybe someone's here,
I'd rather be on land.

50:33.306 --> 50:34.997
There's nothing here.

50:34.997 --> 50:36.585
Our best bet is to keep sailing.

50:36.585 --> 50:39.277
Sail to where, where are we?

50:39.277 --> 50:44.351
I don't know.

51:23.045 --> 51:24.219
Where you going?

51:24.219 --> 51:26.393
We're not gonna make
it back to the boat.

51:27.360 --> 51:29.707
It's getting dark.

51:29.707 --> 51:34.781
We need rest.

52:43.194 --> 52:44.885
You know how to build
a campfire?

52:46.956 --> 52:49.200
Yeah, you keep the sticks
spread apart

52:49.200 --> 52:50.960
so air can get in, right?

52:52.790 --> 52:54.550
You're one hell of
a quick study.

52:56.828 --> 52:58.658
You could probably build
the next one on your own.

53:00.522 --> 53:02.455
You guys didn't
get out much, did you?

53:03.628 --> 53:07.080
No, we've only been
to the coast like once.

53:07.080 --> 53:09.669
I can't believe how
quickly you took to shooting.

53:10.497 --> 53:12.775
I mean, I've never
seen anything like it.

53:12.775 --> 53:15.502
You sure your dad didn't
give you a little lesson?

53:17.504 --> 53:20.266
Well, he died when
I was really young.

53:20.266 --> 53:21.577
I didn't really know him.

53:22.889 --> 53:25.961
He was a decorated soldier
though, I know that.

53:25.961 --> 53:27.549
It must be in the blood then.

53:30.137 --> 53:31.000
Maybe.

53:34.072 --> 53:36.937
But I lied when I said
I never shot before.

53:38.560 --> 53:41.183
I went a bunch of times
with a guy from work.

53:41.183 --> 53:46.119
I just didn't want my mom to
know, 'cause she hated guns.

53:46.119 --> 53:48.777
Ah-hah, truth comes out.

53:49.640 --> 53:52.194
My dad enlisted so he
could afford college,

53:52.194 --> 53:54.403
but he never made it,

53:56.474 --> 53:57.889
he got blown up in Iraq.

53:59.719 --> 54:02.342
There wasn't even anything
left of him to send home.

54:05.034 --> 54:06.864
I think that's why
it was so important

54:06.864 --> 54:08.590
for my mom that I go to college.

54:10.764 --> 54:12.904
I've always been
a slow learner myself.

54:14.699 --> 54:16.874
Had to learn every single
thing the hard way.

54:18.841 --> 54:21.879
I, Derek Stipes,
do solemnly swear

54:21.879 --> 54:24.019
to protect the constitution
of the United States

54:24.019 --> 54:26.263
and the constitutional laws
of the state of Florida

54:26.263 --> 54:28.817
and protect them against all
enemies, foreign and domestic,

54:28.817 --> 54:31.337
so help me, God and Jesus
and Mary and Joseph,

54:31.337 --> 54:32.614
and the Holy Spirit too.

54:36.756 --> 54:39.483
I believed that for about
10 years

54:39.483 --> 54:41.070
tried to be a really good cop.

54:43.210 --> 54:44.729
But I could never get ahead.

54:46.766 --> 54:51.322
My wife Annalisa left me,
said I was a loser, I was.

54:54.774 --> 54:58.778
10 years of being a good cop
underwater

54:58.778 --> 55:02.851
before I finally realised
that the game was rigged.

55:05.163 --> 55:07.580
I wished I would've learned
that lesson earlier.

55:09.375 --> 55:12.516
You and your mom
are good people, Alma,

55:14.794 --> 55:16.934
she just thought she'd work
her fingers to the bones

55:16.934 --> 55:19.523
so you wouldn't have to work
your fingers to the bone.

55:21.007 --> 55:22.940
But that's not the way it works.

55:24.390 --> 55:26.426
All the hard work
and perseverance

55:26.426 --> 55:27.979
and pluck in the world

55:27.979 --> 55:29.809
don't get you outta
the poor house.

55:32.984 --> 55:35.539
The only way to win a rigged
game is to play dirty,

55:35.539 --> 55:37.817
so I started being a dirty cop.

55:41.510 --> 55:45.342
I realised that's kind
of who I was all along.

55:47.482 --> 55:49.449
And I started to get a
little something for myself,

55:49.449 --> 55:51.762
started to taste a little
of what the good life was,

55:51.762 --> 55:56.283
and then, then I saw
what the bad guys,

55:56.283 --> 55:59.010
the real winners of
the rigged game had.

56:01.599 --> 56:04.015
And I understood
that I was still a chump.

56:06.949 --> 56:10.401
So the first opportunity I saw
to work directly with them,

56:10.401 --> 56:13.818
I jumped at, quit the force,
fuck you oath and all.

56:15.717 --> 56:17.201
And when I saw another
opportunity

56:17.201 --> 56:20.480
to swindle those same bad
guys, I jumped on that too.

56:21.688 --> 56:24.104
I stole as much as I could,

56:24.104 --> 56:26.175
and I didn't even
feel bad about it.

56:27.694 --> 56:28.557
You know why?

56:30.663 --> 56:33.562
Because the Captain
is pure fucking evil.

56:38.015 --> 56:39.085
Who's the Captain?

56:44.366 --> 56:46.126
He's the man
who shot your mom,

56:48.232 --> 56:53.271
and he has done things you
could not even imagine.

56:56.723 --> 56:58.898
Tell me about the Captain.

56:58.898 --> 57:01.935
He likes girls,
very young girls.

57:03.592 --> 57:05.974
Gonna fucking kill him.

57:05.974 --> 57:08.045
You wanna kill the Captain?

57:10.427 --> 57:12.429
You're gonna need to forget
everything you learned

57:12.429 --> 57:13.982
about playing by the rules.

57:14.879 --> 57:15.570
Fight dirty.

57:17.019 --> 57:19.056
You think you got a poker face?

57:19.056 --> 57:21.299
You were scared shitless,
I could see that.

57:22.197 --> 57:23.578
Learn to lie better.

57:26.753 --> 57:28.445
You were pretty good
with those knots.

57:28.445 --> 57:30.757
You want me to show you
where you fucked up?

57:31.931 --> 57:32.794
It's okay.

57:32.794 --> 57:35.417
Come on, kiddo, gotta learn.

57:36.556 --> 57:37.454
Come on.

57:40.146 --> 57:44.461
This is the knot you
should have tied on me.

57:47.947 --> 57:49.258
Try to get outta that.

57:55.161 --> 57:56.334
What's that?

57:59.821 --> 58:01.305
It's an EPIRB.

58:01.305 --> 58:02.582
What's it do?

58:02.582 --> 58:05.689
Or you could have
tried this knot.

58:05.689 --> 58:06.793
What's it do?

58:08.415 --> 58:09.347
You activate it,

58:11.177 --> 58:13.835
it sends a SOS signal
to a satellite,

58:14.939 --> 58:16.320
people come rescue us.

58:16.941 --> 58:17.942
You said it didn't work.

58:17.942 --> 58:18.874
Try that out.

58:22.015 --> 58:25.467
Hey, you still think
I'd let your mom die?

58:26.606 --> 58:28.470
No, I'm sorry I said that.

58:28.470 --> 58:29.506
Good,

58:30.576 --> 58:31.369
good.

58:38.791 --> 58:40.482
It's a beautiful ring, isn't it?

58:46.661 --> 58:48.145
You want it?

58:48.145 --> 58:49.974
Did you take that
off her finger?

58:51.044 --> 58:52.529
I thought your mom was so hot.

58:55.048 --> 58:57.257
Figured we'd have so
much fun sailing around

58:57.257 --> 58:58.500
on my big getaway.

59:00.157 --> 59:02.090
When I found out you were
tagging along, I was pissed,

59:02.090 --> 59:05.852
but then I saw that you
were hot too, so win-win.

59:07.474 --> 59:09.684
I never really knew your mom.

59:09.684 --> 59:12.272
I mean, not very well.

59:13.204 --> 59:16.242
Now she's dead, RIP.

59:18.140 --> 59:19.901
I didn't give her this necklace.

59:22.351 --> 59:23.870
Why did you say you did?

59:25.078 --> 59:26.459
I needed you to trust me.

59:35.157 --> 59:37.159
I'm sorry,
I can't raise both hands.

59:37.159 --> 59:38.540
Stay down.

59:38.540 --> 59:41.198
I'm guessing target practise
didn't involve handguns.

59:41.198 --> 59:43.614
Does the EPIRB work,
turn it on.

59:43.614 --> 59:45.374
- I can't do that.
- Do it?

59:45.374 --> 59:47.618
No, not yet.

59:47.618 --> 59:48.964
Why not, do it?

59:48.964 --> 59:53.417
Because when they come
you'll talk too much.

59:53.417 --> 59:56.213
What are you talking about?

59:56.213 --> 59:58.180
I have to kill you.

59:59.734 --> 01:00:01.390
You have no clip.

01:01:58.749 --> 01:02:00.924
Oh, Rosie, sweetie Rosie,

01:02:03.547 --> 01:02:04.721
sweetie.

01:02:40.170 --> 01:02:42.034
Get me back to the boat.

01:02:42.034 --> 01:02:44.519
Get me back to the boat,
and I'll activate the EPIRB.

01:02:44.519 --> 01:02:45.969
Activate it now.

01:02:45.969 --> 01:02:48.903
Not till you get me
back to the boat [groans].

01:02:48.903 --> 01:02:49.766
Give it to me.

01:02:51.146 --> 01:02:52.596
You need me.

01:02:56.842 --> 01:02:59.154
Quit fucking around.

01:02:59.154 --> 01:03:02.606
You need me, and I need you.

01:03:02.606 --> 01:03:04.815
Get me back to the boat,
and we're both safe.

01:03:08.370 --> 01:03:09.820
You can't make it without me.

01:03:11.339 --> 01:03:13.893
Why the fuck did you not
activate the EPIRB on the boat?

01:03:13.893 --> 01:03:15.757
What the fuck
were you waiting for?

01:03:17.932 --> 01:03:20.382
I thought we could get
outta here on our own.

01:03:20.382 --> 01:03:25.456
I'd keep you quiet, I was
gonna trade you to the Captain.

01:03:27.493 --> 01:03:30.910
Maybe he'd spare my life if I
offered him some fresh meat.

01:03:32.670 --> 01:03:36.226
But it turns out this island

01:03:36.226 --> 01:03:38.124
is fucking deserted.

01:03:41.093 --> 01:03:43.267
It's not fucking working.

01:03:43.267 --> 01:03:45.338
You gotta get me outta here.

01:06:20.631 --> 01:06:21.529
No, no!

01:06:27.224 --> 01:06:30.296
No, don't leave me,
don't leave me.

01:06:31.159 --> 01:06:32.402
Don't leave me, no [cries].

01:06:32.402 --> 01:06:34.335
No, no, no.

01:09:11.561 --> 01:09:12.424
Help!

01:09:15.220 --> 01:09:16.117
Help!

01:10:35.541 --> 01:10:37.025
Here's her gun.

01:10:38.234 --> 01:10:40.684
She's just
in time to eat.

01:10:40.684 --> 01:10:41.582
You hungry?

01:10:43.031 --> 01:10:44.792
I'll tell the Captain
she's here.

01:11:20.068 --> 01:11:21.380
You know you can't
take weapons

01:11:21.380 --> 01:11:23.106
through international waters, right?

01:11:28.905 --> 01:11:30.078
Just fucking with you.

01:11:50.271 --> 01:11:51.341
You're new.

01:11:52.549 --> 01:11:54.965
Come on, let's go.

01:12:09.911 --> 01:12:12.051
I'm cold,
can I please take a shower?

01:14:04.232 --> 01:14:05.371
Hi, can I come in?

01:14:05.371 --> 01:14:07.166
That's the girl
we picked up.

01:14:07.166 --> 01:14:08.927
You can't be in here.

01:14:10.584 --> 01:14:11.412
No, it's fine.

01:14:19.144 --> 01:14:20.697
What can I do for you?

01:14:20.697 --> 01:14:22.837
Are you the Captain?

01:14:22.837 --> 01:14:24.908
Yes, I'm the Captain.

01:14:24.908 --> 01:14:28.084
I wanted to thank you
for saving me.

01:14:36.541 --> 01:14:37.507
You're welcome.

01:14:39.716 --> 01:14:41.787
The fellas told me
what you went through.

01:14:43.306 --> 01:14:44.480
You're a brave girl.

01:14:48.242 --> 01:14:50.831
This ship is so much
bigger than the one I was on.

01:14:54.144 --> 01:14:55.491
What does that joystick do?

01:14:56.422 --> 01:15:00.392
This one right here
controls the rudder.

01:15:04.845 --> 01:15:06.294
What happens if I move it?

01:15:08.504 --> 01:15:11.334
Nothing, it's on autopilot.

01:15:11.334 --> 01:15:12.818
Where's the autopilot?

01:15:17.133 --> 01:15:18.168
Give me your hand,

01:15:20.516 --> 01:15:21.378
it's right there.

01:15:23.311 --> 01:15:24.174
These two.

01:15:27.626 --> 01:15:30.526
Is it hard driving
something this big?

01:15:32.355 --> 01:15:33.736
Nothing's hard for me.

01:15:35.807 --> 01:15:36.911
What about for me?

01:15:38.119 --> 01:15:39.604
I wanna drive it.

01:15:41.295 --> 01:15:43.953
This ship was built for
deep waters.

01:15:43.953 --> 01:15:48.544
We're travelling in a straight
line until we get to port.

01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:21.438
The real world is out there,

01:16:24.096 --> 01:16:26.271
this is just a virtual world.

01:16:28.756 --> 01:16:32.726
You have to keep your eyes
on lookout

01:16:38.386 --> 01:16:39.802
at all times.

01:16:42.252 --> 01:16:43.322
What if I wanna turn?

01:16:48.327 --> 01:16:49.708
Then turn.

01:16:49.708 --> 01:16:53.263
You already put us on
standby, we're off autopilot.

01:16:54.299 --> 01:16:55.921
Turn it starboard side.

01:16:57.578 --> 01:16:58.441
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:17:00.546 --> 01:17:01.789
You know your starboard, huh?

01:17:03.446 --> 01:17:04.620
Turn it slow.

01:17:06.069 --> 01:17:07.899
That's right, slow.

01:17:07.899 --> 01:17:09.107
Turn it slower.

01:17:11.143 --> 01:17:12.731
Turn it slower.

01:17:16.597 --> 01:17:20.359
Now you see on the
compass how we've turned?

01:17:22.430 --> 01:17:23.811
The only problem is

01:17:25.951 --> 01:17:27.608
we're headed the wrong way.

01:17:32.924 --> 01:17:35.064
Do I just click it back
on autopilot?

01:17:35.064 --> 01:17:37.825
Just click it back
on autopilot.

01:17:42.554 --> 01:17:43.935
Seems pretty easy.

01:17:47.524 --> 01:17:49.181
It's easy till
you get to port.

01:17:50.976 --> 01:17:52.806
It's when you're almost home,

01:17:55.084 --> 01:17:56.568
that's when it gets hard.

01:17:57.776 --> 01:17:58.777
This is pretty.

01:18:02.747 --> 01:18:07.337
I was cut by coral,
is that dangerous?

01:18:07.337 --> 01:18:11.894
It can be,
some coral is poisonous.

01:18:13.792 --> 01:18:15.794
As long as you put
the right solution

01:18:15.794 --> 01:18:17.693
and the right ointment on it,

01:18:18.970 --> 01:18:20.834
the wound won't get infected.

01:18:22.698 --> 01:18:25.977
'Cause a coral cut
not taken care of

01:18:28.013 --> 01:18:32.017
could last for a very long time.

01:18:33.501 --> 01:18:34.848
Do you have the ointment?

01:18:36.539 --> 01:18:38.092
Yeah, I have the ointment.

01:18:41.371 --> 01:18:43.028
Did you wash your cut

01:18:44.961 --> 01:18:45.824
thoroughly?

01:18:46.756 --> 01:18:48.516
Did you use water?

01:18:48.516 --> 01:18:50.726
Did you use hydrogen peroxide?

01:18:51.761 --> 01:18:52.693
Just water.

01:18:57.146 --> 01:18:59.700
Do you want me
to take care of it?

01:18:59.700 --> 01:19:01.598
Do you want me
to take care of you?

01:19:05.499 --> 01:19:06.362
You sure?

01:19:16.027 --> 01:19:18.926
Why don't you come over here
so I can take a closer look.

01:19:50.026 --> 01:19:51.994
Anyone have eyes
on the castaway girl?

01:19:53.789 --> 01:19:55.687
She's on the bridge
with the Captain.

01:19:55.687 --> 01:19:56.861
My mother's name was Alma.

01:19:56.861 --> 01:19:58.276
She has
one of our guns.

01:19:58.276 --> 01:19:59.242
Get her now.

01:20:05.386 --> 01:20:06.249
Fuck!

01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:25.924
Anybody seen
the girl, where is she?

01:20:36.348 --> 01:20:41.319
Hey.

01:20:42.492 --> 01:20:46.220
Have you seen my gun,
it's big, it's an AR15?

01:20:51.605 --> 01:20:52.848
Are you okay?

01:21:00.096 --> 01:21:01.132
Do you need a gun?

01:21:02.547 --> 01:21:03.410
Yes.

01:21:06.862 --> 01:21:09.623
There's lots of guns
down there.

01:21:09.623 --> 01:21:10.762
Down where?

01:21:11.901 --> 01:21:13.661
In the engine room.

01:21:13.661 --> 01:21:15.008
Okay, how do I get there?

01:21:21.704 --> 01:21:26.743
Straight, right, right,
there's a door on the stairs.

01:21:30.851 --> 01:21:31.714
Okay.

01:21:34.579 --> 01:21:38.617
They're all pumped full of
drugs, they can't help you.

01:21:38.617 --> 01:21:39.756
Who can't help me?

01:21:41.482 --> 01:21:42.449
All the girls.

01:21:52.666 --> 01:21:55.393
Just went through
the control room, nothing.

01:21:57.671 --> 01:21:59.052
I'm down
on the main deck,

01:21:59.052 --> 01:22:00.467
I'll search the rooms here.

01:23:03.737 --> 01:23:06.464
Hey, don't move.

01:23:07.085 --> 01:23:08.362
Stay right there.

01:23:10.675 --> 01:23:12.125
Stay where you are.

01:25:34.957 --> 01:25:38.995
Roberta, do you
have eyes on the girl?

01:25:42.585 --> 01:25:44.449
She's up on the bridge.

01:26:08.197 --> 01:26:09.509
Shit!

01:28:23.021 --> 01:28:25.507
Gonna get you all home.

01:28:28.095 --> 01:28:29.580
Drop the gun!

01:28:29.580 --> 01:28:30.891
Drop it.

01:28:30.891 --> 01:28:34.378
Close the door.

01:28:34.378 --> 01:28:35.275
Lock it.

01:28:43.766 --> 01:28:45.458
You're gonna die, bitch!

01:28:45.458 --> 01:28:48.081
I'm not afraid.

01:28:48.081 --> 01:28:49.254
I'm not afraid!

01:28:55.019 --> 01:28:56.331
How many more
of them are on the ship?

01:28:58.436 --> 01:29:00.196
Five plus the Captain.

01:29:01.577 --> 01:29:03.130
Six. Six!

01:29:07.169 --> 01:29:09.102
Let me see, let me see.

01:29:09.102 --> 01:29:11.725
It's okay, you're okay,
it just grazed you.

01:29:11.725 --> 01:29:13.900
Stay here, I'm gonna radio
for help, okay?

01:29:16.212 --> 01:29:19.388
The Captain's gonna be so mad.

01:29:19.388 --> 01:29:21.908
The Captain's dead.

01:29:57.253 --> 01:29:58.116
How?

01:30:06.401 --> 01:30:10.094
Turns out the EPIRB
worked after all.

01:30:12.407 --> 01:30:14.719
Just had to fiddle
with the battery.

01:30:14.719 --> 01:30:15.927
Stupid me, right?

01:30:16.928 --> 01:30:18.654
Why hasn't the Captain
killed you?

01:30:18.654 --> 01:30:19.690
Because we worked it all out.

01:30:23.763 --> 01:30:26.697
I told you, learn to lie.

01:30:31.011 --> 01:30:32.737
And all that advice

01:30:35.775 --> 01:30:37.293
kind of pointless, Rose,

01:30:40.296 --> 01:30:41.781
'cause you belong to him now.

01:30:45.992 --> 01:30:47.303
What's so fucking funny?

01:30:49.202 --> 01:30:50.617
I did take your advice,

01:30:53.137 --> 01:30:54.483
I killed the Captain.

01:34:22.760 --> 01:34:24.141
Are you okay?

01:34:27.489 --> 01:34:28.835
Let me get you outta here.

01:34:30.009 --> 01:34:32.874
Come on,
you need to see something.

01:35:15.882 --> 01:35:18.713
It's an incredible story,
Rose.

01:35:20.300 --> 01:35:21.577
You're lucky to be alive.

01:35:23.131 --> 01:35:24.097
If you say so.

01:35:27.998 --> 01:35:29.758
The girls who were with me.

01:35:29.758 --> 01:35:33.728
They are being reunited with
their families as we speak.

01:35:33.728 --> 01:35:36.938
And the plan's already in
motion to get you home too.

01:35:36.938 --> 01:35:40.286
No, I don't have a home
anymore.

01:35:43.738 --> 01:35:45.291
I have nothing.

01:35:45.291 --> 01:35:47.707
That's not true,
you have a future.

01:35:52.574 --> 01:35:56.129
That's something,

01:35:56.129 --> 01:35:57.855
and you fought for it.
