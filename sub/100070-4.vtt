00:52.400 --> 00:54.360
- Hello.
- Hi.

00:55.360 --> 00:56.360
- Oh, you've lost Buddy?
- Yeah.

00:56.361 --> 01:00.039
He's been missing for a couple of
days now so if you see him?

01:00.040 --> 01:03.404
- I'll keep my eyes open.
- Thank you.

01:16.360 --> 01:17.360
Hello.

01:17.361 --> 01:19.359
Hello.

01:19.360 --> 01:21.559
I've handed leaflets to everyone
and everywhere I can think of.

01:21.560 --> 01:23.359
Have you tried the pound?
They might have him.

01:23.360 --> 01:25.359
They put them down sometimes.

01:25.360 --> 01:28.359
Don't say that in front of James.
I don't want to upset him.

01:28.360 --> 01:30.359
He won't understand what I've said.

01:30.360 --> 01:31.560
Here.

01:37.360 --> 01:38.360
What's in this?

01:38.361 --> 01:40.359
Broccoli, spinach, and kale.

01:40.360 --> 01:42.359
It contains
vitamins, fibre, calcium,

01:42.360 --> 01:44.359
iron, foliate, and potassium.

01:44.360 --> 01:47.359
Mm. It tastes like it.

01:47.360 --> 01:48.360
Thanks.

01:48.361 --> 01:50.359
- Morning.
- Morning, Ruth.

01:50.360 --> 01:53.359
Hi there. I'll just finish
getting James ready for nursery

01:53.360 --> 01:54.360
then you can take him along.

01:54.361 --> 01:56.359
Thanks for this, Ruth.

01:56.360 --> 01:58.359
We really appreciate it.

01:58.360 --> 01:59.360
It's no problem at all.

01:59.361 --> 02:01.359
I'm looking forward to
spending some time with him.

02:01.360 --> 02:04.359
I wish you'd stay here
while they were fixing your boiler.

02:04.360 --> 02:05.360
It'd be much easier.

02:05.360 --> 02:06.360
I like it at the pub.

02:06.361 --> 02:08.878
It has character.

02:08.880 --> 02:10.719
I hope you're preparing properly.

02:10.720 --> 02:12.359
It's a complete farce.

02:12.360 --> 02:14.359
Oh, that's the spirit (!)

02:14.360 --> 02:17.039
It'll be pretend patients
presenting pretend illnesses

02:17.040 --> 02:18.359
in the presence of
some ghastly assessor

02:18.360 --> 02:20.359
reporting on
how I pretend to diagnose them.

02:20.360 --> 02:22.359
I'd better get going, then.

02:22.360 --> 02:24.359
You're gonna have a lovely day
with Ruth.

02:24.360 --> 02:26.359
Yeah.

02:26.360 --> 02:27.451
There we go.

02:29.360 --> 02:31.359
Well, good luck today.

02:31.360 --> 02:32.360
Thank you.

02:32.361 --> 02:34.359
See you later, sweetie.
Thanks, Ruth.

02:34.360 --> 02:36.359
- Bye.
- Right, I'll open the surgery.

02:36.360 --> 02:38.360
COCKEREL CROWS

02:39.400 --> 02:42.359
Apart from the tractor and digger,
was anything else stolen?

02:42.360 --> 02:44.200
No.

02:45.360 --> 02:48.359
Policeman's here, Billy.

02:48.360 --> 02:50.359
Say hello, then.

02:50.360 --> 02:52.199
- Hello.
- Hello.

02:52.200 --> 02:54.359
You didn't see or hear anything
last night either?

02:54.360 --> 02:57.199
No. I wouldn't, though,
cos my machine.

02:57.200 --> 02:58.359
Your machine?

02:58.360 --> 02:59.399
He's got this white noise thing.

02:59.400 --> 03:02.359
It helps him sleep, apparently.

03:02.360 --> 03:03.360
It's calming.

03:03.361 --> 03:05.359
I'll send my report to
stations in the area

03:05.360 --> 03:07.399
so they can keep their eyes peeled.

03:07.400 --> 03:10.359
Do you have the chassis numbers
for the vehicles?

03:10.360 --> 03:13.359
It should all be there,
but let me know if it's not.

03:13.360 --> 03:15.039
We'd meant to do
a big tidy-up of the farm,

03:15.040 --> 03:17.039
paperwork and all, after Dad died.

03:17.040 --> 03:19.359
But... Well, you know how it is.

03:19.360 --> 03:21.359
Work gets in the way.

03:21.360 --> 03:24.359
I wonder how they managed to move
the tractor and digger

03:24.360 --> 03:26.359
without making any noise?

03:26.360 --> 03:28.359
Could have used the low-loader.

03:28.360 --> 03:30.359
Suggests they're professionals.

03:30.360 --> 03:33.359
It's all about finding patterns.

03:33.360 --> 03:35.359
It's the last thing we need.

03:35.360 --> 03:36.399
I don't know
how we're gonna replace them.

03:36.400 --> 03:38.199
You don't have insurance?

03:38.200 --> 03:40.199
Well, yeah, it's just the hassle,
isn't it?

03:40.200 --> 03:43.359
Plus these companies always try
and screw over the working man.

03:43.360 --> 03:47.451
Well, I'll take one last look
around the yard.

03:51.360 --> 03:55.997
You'd be surprised
what the trained eye can pick up.

03:58.360 --> 04:00.359
You want a tea or a coffee?

04:00.360 --> 04:04.359
- Billy can fix you one.
- I wouldn't say no to a coffee.

04:04.360 --> 04:06.633
You heard the man, Billy.

04:07.560 --> 04:09.360
Milk, two sugars.

04:21.360 --> 04:25.451
Surgery's closed this morning.
GMC assessment.

04:33.560 --> 04:36.106
We're not open this morning.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.359
- Oh, what are you doing here?
- If I told you that,

04:39.360 --> 04:41.359
I'd have to kill you.
Not that I would.

04:41.360 --> 04:43.879
It's just an expression.
I'd never actually kill anyone.

04:43.880 --> 04:45.359
I thought you were in Poland.

04:45.360 --> 04:47.359
No, living in Exeter now.
It's a long story.

04:47.360 --> 04:50.359
Right, sounds great.

04:50.360 --> 04:52.359
So, you're working here now.
That's a relief.

04:52.360 --> 04:53.360
I had you down as a possible.

04:53.361 --> 04:55.359
- A possible?
- Criminal in the making.

04:55.360 --> 04:57.359
Remember you were something of
a shoplifter.

04:57.360 --> 04:59.359
I forgot to pay for
a packet of crisps.

04:59.360 --> 05:00.360
Once.

05:00.361 --> 05:02.359
The jails are full of people
who forgot things.

05:02.360 --> 05:04.359
Good to see you on the
straight and narrow. Is the doc in?

05:04.360 --> 05:07.199
Yeah, he is,
but surgery's closed this morning.

05:07.200 --> 05:08.359
It won't take long.

05:08.360 --> 05:11.359
It's police business
and I bet he'll be stoked to see me.

05:11.360 --> 05:12.724
Guess who, Doc.

05:15.360 --> 05:16.360
Doc?

05:18.360 --> 05:21.359
- It's me.
- Yes, how can I help you?

05:21.360 --> 05:23.039
Mark Mylow.

05:23.040 --> 05:24.359
I know.

05:24.360 --> 05:26.359
You don't seem surprised to see me.

05:26.360 --> 05:28.359
I didn't know I was supposed to be.

05:28.360 --> 05:30.359
- Are you well?
- I'm good, yeah.

05:30.360 --> 05:32.559
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

05:32.560 --> 05:35.359
Have you redecorated in here?

05:35.360 --> 05:36.879
No.

05:36.880 --> 05:39.359
You've got a dog.

05:39.360 --> 05:41.359
It's a stray, currently missing.

05:41.360 --> 05:42.360
If I see anything,
I'll let you know.

05:42.361 --> 05:46.359
I'm actually here with a case,
but maybe two birds, one stone.

05:46.360 --> 05:47.360
Did you want to see me?

05:47.361 --> 05:50.040
Just wanted to say hello.

05:51.880 --> 05:54.359
Also, I've had a pain in my spine,
my upper legs, and my pelvic area.

05:54.360 --> 05:56.879
Plus, a feeling like I've got
a full bladder all the time

05:56.880 --> 05:59.517
and then trouble... you know.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.360
Any other symptoms?

06:01.361 --> 06:04.359
Stings when
I finally do manage to...

06:04.360 --> 06:06.199
I think it's prostate cancer.

06:06.200 --> 06:07.359
Why do you think that?

06:07.360 --> 06:09.359
- I looked it up.
- I need to give you

06:09.360 --> 06:11.359
a full examination.
I have an appointment,

06:11.360 --> 06:12.879
but I can spare you five minutes.

06:12.880 --> 06:14.359
Oh, thanks, Doc.

06:14.360 --> 06:17.815
You're the only one I trust
to do this.

06:22.360 --> 06:25.542
Onto the examination table, please.

06:34.360 --> 06:36.360
Get onto your side.

06:38.360 --> 06:40.359
I'll give you an internal
examination as well.

06:40.360 --> 06:42.815
Please take off your pants.

06:44.360 --> 06:48.359
I don't mind telling you, Doc. I get
a little nostalgic for my time here.

06:48.360 --> 06:50.359
Time passes, you get older

06:50.360 --> 06:53.199
and you get to wondering
where all the years have gone.

06:53.200 --> 06:54.382
Stop talking.

06:58.880 --> 07:01.359
There's no sign of anything unusual.

07:01.360 --> 07:04.359
I'll take some blood and urine
samples and run some tests.

07:04.360 --> 07:06.359
How long are you staying
in Portwenn for?

07:06.360 --> 07:08.359
I'm actually here
in an official capacity.

07:08.360 --> 07:09.399
Very hush-hush.

07:09.400 --> 07:14.219
Hop up on the table, please,
and take off your jacket.

07:18.360 --> 07:19.906
Give me your arm.

07:25.040 --> 07:27.559
God, remember how you used to have
that blood phobia?

07:27.560 --> 07:29.359
Used to make me laugh.

07:29.360 --> 07:33.542
A doctor who couldn't stand
the sight of blood!

07:35.360 --> 07:37.360
Sorry, Doc.

07:42.360 --> 07:45.719
Come back for your test results
on Wednesday.

07:45.720 --> 07:47.559
Thanks, Doc. And, er...

07:47.560 --> 07:50.359
Maybe we can catch up over dinner
some time?

07:50.360 --> 07:52.360
HE MUMBLES

07:54.360 --> 07:55.360
Oops.

07:55.361 --> 07:58.399
Ooh, careful there,
I'll arrest you for speeding (!)

07:58.400 --> 08:01.359
Ah, yes, very good.

08:01.360 --> 08:04.359
Dr Ellingham, I am Dr Edward Mullen.

08:04.360 --> 08:06.359
Officer of the GMC.

08:06.360 --> 08:08.359
Call me Ed.

08:08.360 --> 08:11.724
I'm here to carry out
your assessment.

08:14.200 --> 08:17.359
Now, I know you find this whole
shooting match a bit of a pain

08:17.360 --> 08:19.359
but I have a job to do,

08:19.360 --> 08:21.359
you've got a job to get back to,

08:21.360 --> 08:23.359
so let's make this
as painless as possible.

08:23.360 --> 08:24.719
I'd appreciate that.

08:24.720 --> 08:26.719
Great. Now, I have hand-picked

08:26.720 --> 08:29.359
three guinea pigs
from my own patient list.

08:29.360 --> 08:32.359
They'll have their symptoms revised.

08:32.360 --> 08:35.359
No peeking now. The whole thing
should only take a couple of hours

08:35.360 --> 08:37.359
They'll come in,
they'll explain to you...

08:37.360 --> 08:38.558
Yes, I know how it works.

08:38.559 --> 08:43.359
It's just part of my remit includes
explaining to you.

08:43.360 --> 08:44.360
It's not necessary.

08:44.361 --> 08:47.089
Right, well, let's get this...

08:47.360 --> 08:49.724
...show on the road, then.

08:52.360 --> 08:54.359
Why do you think he's here?

08:54.360 --> 08:56.359
Routine inspection.

08:56.360 --> 08:58.359
He's never done one before.

08:58.360 --> 09:00.359
Maybe he's come to congratulate us.

09:00.360 --> 09:02.719
Ah, Ken, you're here already.

09:02.720 --> 09:05.359
You caught us right in the middle
of our daily cleaning routine.

09:05.360 --> 09:07.359
- Right, boy?
- Do you want me to show you around?

09:07.360 --> 09:09.359
I've made some improvements.

09:09.360 --> 09:10.360
Sounds good.

09:10.361 --> 09:12.359
Bit of a long journey here, though.

09:12.360 --> 09:14.359
- I'll fix you a drink.
- Ken don't drink.

09:14.360 --> 09:17.359
- I meant water.
- So, Ken, how are you?

09:17.360 --> 09:19.359
Sorry, Bert, do you mind
if we catch up later?

09:19.360 --> 09:20.879
I might have a quick lie down.

09:20.880 --> 09:22.359
Exactly.

09:22.360 --> 09:25.359
You're in number five
overlooking the harbour.

09:25.360 --> 09:26.399
Nothing but the best for the boss.

09:26.400 --> 09:30.400
And don't worry,
I'll bring your suitcase up.

09:32.360 --> 09:34.359
Any room at the inn?

09:34.360 --> 09:35.360
Mark!

09:39.040 --> 09:41.950
Dosage is on the label. Goodbye.

09:45.040 --> 09:46.359
Oh, dear.

09:46.360 --> 09:48.359
I thought I told you to go and see
the doctor.

09:48.360 --> 09:50.879
It's closed all morning
for some assessment thing.

09:50.880 --> 09:53.359
- What assessment?
- Morwenna said it was for the BFG

09:53.360 --> 09:55.359
- or something.
- GMC.

09:55.360 --> 09:56.360
Could be.

09:56.361 --> 09:58.359
I'm closing for a bit.

09:58.360 --> 10:00.359
Go on, out, out, get out all of you.

10:00.360 --> 10:02.359
Out, out, out.

10:02.360 --> 10:03.880
Out, go on.

10:07.880 --> 10:13.359
So, I have placed some extra sheets
on the reception desk here.

10:13.360 --> 10:14.360
Jill! You're up first.

10:14.361 --> 10:17.725
Remember your non-verbal cues
as well.

10:19.360 --> 10:20.399
Is that the assessor?

10:20.400 --> 10:22.359
Sorry, who are you?

10:22.360 --> 10:24.359
Fellow medical practitioner.

10:24.360 --> 10:26.359
I thought it might be prudent

10:26.360 --> 10:27.360
to give you some context.

10:27.361 --> 10:29.359
Context?

10:29.360 --> 10:32.359
Dr Ellingham has been
a great servant to the village

10:32.360 --> 10:34.559
and on a personal level,
he's helped me hugely

10:34.560 --> 10:37.359
after the death of my husband.
Have you lost a loved one?

10:37.360 --> 10:40.359
- Yes, actually, I have.
- Recently?

10:40.360 --> 10:41.400
No.

10:43.360 --> 10:45.633
I was just looking at it.

10:47.360 --> 10:48.360
Doctor.

10:48.361 --> 10:50.359
Carpal tunnel syndrome.

10:50.360 --> 10:52.359
What?

10:52.360 --> 10:53.360
I think you should leave, lady.

10:53.361 --> 10:55.998
I think you should leave too.

11:03.360 --> 11:05.359
For your information, doctor,
I would have expected

11:05.360 --> 11:08.359
to see numbness and tingling
in the thumb and forefinger,

11:08.360 --> 11:09.360
discomfort in the wrist.

11:09.361 --> 11:12.359
I would recommend the patient use an
ice bath three to four times a day

11:12.360 --> 11:14.359
and if there's any wastage
of the thenar eminence,

11:14.360 --> 11:16.359
I would suggest surgery.

11:16.360 --> 11:20.270
Shall we pretend to see
another patient now?

11:24.880 --> 11:26.359
Sit down, Jill.

11:26.360 --> 11:30.724
Right, Jerry, you're up next.
Don't mess this up.

11:39.477 --> 11:41.476
So, how long you been back?

11:41.477 --> 11:42.477
Almost a year now.

11:42.478 --> 11:45.476
No way. I did try and get hold of
you a little while back

11:45.477 --> 11:47.476
but your phone
was no longer working.

11:47.477 --> 11:49.476
New country, new phone.
I was gonna get in touch

11:49.477 --> 11:50.477
but I was swamped with work.

11:50.478 --> 11:52.476
Earning my stripes,
you know how it is.

11:52.477 --> 11:54.476
Yeah, I don't know.
I still make time for people.

11:54.477 --> 11:57.476
Actually, Morwenna keeps saying
you want to make more time for her.

11:57.477 --> 11:58.477
They're getting married.

11:58.478 --> 12:00.476
Oh, congratulations.

12:00.477 --> 12:01.477
Yeah, I'm pretty lucky.

12:01.478 --> 12:04.316
You know she stole
a packet of crisps once?

12:04.317 --> 12:05.476
Right.

12:05.477 --> 12:08.476
That's not really gonna affect
my decision to marry her.

12:08.477 --> 12:09.477
No, I suppose not.

12:09.478 --> 12:11.996
You always did have a thing
for receptionists.

12:11.997 --> 12:15.156
We have a word for that
in the force, serial behaviour.

12:15.157 --> 12:16.476
Well, it's a small village.

12:16.477 --> 12:18.476
What about you, Bert?
Any lucky ladies?

12:18.477 --> 12:19.477
- I got engaged.
- Ooh.

12:19.478 --> 12:21.476
She dumped me.

12:21.477 --> 12:25.476
Oh. That's a bit depressing.
Sort of wish I hadn't asked.

12:25.477 --> 12:26.477
Anyway, the reason I'm here is

12:26.478 --> 12:29.476
the top brass in Exeter
wanted to use my local knowledge.

12:29.477 --> 12:32.476
Big case. What can you tell me
about the new boy?

12:32.477 --> 12:33.477
- New boy?
- PC Penhale.

12:33.478 --> 12:35.836
Oh, Joe. Oh, he's fine.

12:35.837 --> 12:38.476
Time was when a policeman had to be
more than fine.

12:38.477 --> 12:41.476
I've checked his records.
He's hardly got a string of arrests.

12:41.477 --> 12:43.476
Well, it's pretty quiet round here,
isn't it?

12:43.477 --> 12:45.476
He did get kicked in the head
by a horse once.

12:45.477 --> 12:47.156
Yes.

12:47.157 --> 12:49.476
Well, I suppose
I'd better check in on him.

12:49.477 --> 12:52.476
Every Sherlock has
their Holmes traipsing behind them.

12:52.477 --> 12:53.477
Think you mean Watson?

12:53.478 --> 12:55.996
- I know what I meant, Al.
- Right.

12:55.997 --> 12:58.476
Anyway, it's, er, great to see you,
mate.

12:58.477 --> 12:59.477
- Yeah.
- And I'm sorry

12:59.478 --> 13:01.569
for not being in touch.

13:08.157 --> 13:10.885
Have you lost weight recently?

13:11.477 --> 13:12.477
A little bit, yeah.

13:12.478 --> 13:14.476
HE COUGHS

13:14.477 --> 13:16.476
But it's mostly this cough,

13:16.477 --> 13:19.476
and the, er, sweats, and headaches.

13:19.477 --> 13:22.568
I'll look at your chest. Lie down.

13:27.477 --> 13:30.476
Oh, bugger's gone fizzy again.
Just a minute.

13:30.477 --> 13:32.676
What do you mean? What's gone fizzy?
Your leg?

13:32.677 --> 13:36.996
- Yeah.
- Do you have an urge to move them?

13:36.997 --> 13:40.316
Do they get hot and itchy
if you lie or sit still?

13:40.317 --> 13:42.476
They twitch at night too.
It's been driving the wife nuts.

13:42.477 --> 13:44.476
That's Restless Leg Syndrome.

13:44.477 --> 13:47.476
You should have your GP run some
bloods and test your iron levels.

13:47.477 --> 13:49.476
In the meantime,
lay off the caffeine and alcohol.

13:49.477 --> 13:50.477
I have to give up the beer?

13:50.478 --> 13:53.476
If you and your wife want a decent
night's sleep you should, yes.

13:53.477 --> 13:55.476
No, that's not act...

13:55.477 --> 13:59.476
He had Influenza Type A
so that's wrong.

13:59.477 --> 14:00.477
What about his legs?

14:00.478 --> 14:03.476
Sorry, Doc,
that wasn't part of the act.

14:03.477 --> 14:05.836
I've just been suffering with
these legs for a while now.

14:05.837 --> 14:07.476
Have you told you own GP about them?

14:07.477 --> 14:11.023
I did, but you didn't follow up
on them.

14:27.477 --> 14:28.477
Hello.

14:28.478 --> 14:30.316
Hello.

14:30.317 --> 14:31.476
Can I help you?

14:31.477 --> 14:33.932
How may I be of assistance?

14:35.477 --> 14:36.477
"How may I be of assistance"

14:36.478 --> 14:38.996
has more of
an air of authority to it.

14:38.997 --> 14:40.476
We're police, not fast-food workers.

14:40.477 --> 14:42.156
And you are?

14:42.157 --> 14:44.316
Sergeant Mark Mylow.

14:44.317 --> 14:46.476
Oh, Mylow as in...

14:46.477 --> 14:47.477
This is my old station, yeah.

14:47.478 --> 14:49.476
I hope
you've been looking after her.

14:49.477 --> 14:51.996
You left a box of clothes
in the wardrobe.

14:51.997 --> 14:55.156
But if you want them, it's too late
cos I took them to the charity shop.

14:55.157 --> 14:56.476
Except the fleece.

14:56.477 --> 14:57.477
I kept the fleece.

14:57.478 --> 14:59.476
It's nice.

14:59.477 --> 15:01.516
I'm just letting you know that
I'll be operating in the area.

15:01.517 --> 15:03.516
Top level hush-hush case.

15:03.517 --> 15:05.476
Top level hush-hush case here?

15:05.477 --> 15:06.477
I've said too much already.

15:06.478 --> 15:09.476
- Maybe I could help?
- I doubt it.

15:09.477 --> 15:11.476
No offence,
this is a big city crime.

15:11.477 --> 15:12.676
Well, maybe if you told me.

15:12.677 --> 15:14.476
A highly-trained gang of thieves

15:14.477 --> 15:16.476
stealing farm machinery
across the southwest.

15:16.477 --> 15:18.476
We had one of those last night.

15:18.477 --> 15:19.516
Really?

15:19.517 --> 15:21.476
Go on, show me.

15:21.477 --> 15:23.476
- I want in on it.
- I'm a senior officer.

15:23.477 --> 15:25.836
- I was first on the case.
- It doesn't work like that.

15:25.837 --> 15:27.476
You could work under me?

15:27.477 --> 15:28.477
I'll need someone to file papers,

15:28.478 --> 15:32.476
chasing up names and numbers,
that kind of thing.

15:32.477 --> 15:34.317
Suppose so.

15:43.517 --> 15:47.476
So, you haven't had sharp, stabbing
pains in your chest lately?

15:47.477 --> 15:50.476
No.

15:50.477 --> 15:54.476
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure. I've been fine.

15:54.477 --> 15:55.477
I take it you're supposed to have

15:55.478 --> 15:57.933
- sharp chest pains.
- Am I?

15:58.477 --> 16:00.476
Does it hurt
when you take deep breaths?

16:00.477 --> 16:02.156
I don't know.

16:02.157 --> 16:03.476
Just give me a second.

16:03.477 --> 16:05.156
Check your sheet.

16:05.157 --> 16:06.476
My sheet?

16:06.477 --> 16:08.476
Your symptom sheet.

16:08.477 --> 16:10.568
Oh, right, OK, hang on.

16:13.477 --> 16:15.476
I forgot my reading glasses.

16:15.477 --> 16:16.837
Let me...

16:18.477 --> 16:21.476
- You have costochondritis.
- OK, great.

16:21.477 --> 16:23.476
I'm sorry, but I fail to see
what this is achieving.

16:23.477 --> 16:24.836
I've had enough.

16:24.837 --> 16:27.156
A complete waste of my time.

16:27.157 --> 16:28.476
All right, Martin,

16:28.477 --> 16:31.476
I admit that it didn't run
as smoothly as we anticipated...

16:31.477 --> 16:35.476
You have one patient with an actual
illness that you failed to diagnose

16:35.477 --> 16:37.476
and this one doesn't seem to know
why she's here at all.

16:37.477 --> 16:39.476
Sorry, Doc.

16:39.477 --> 16:41.476
How do I get treatment
for costochondritis?

16:41.477 --> 16:43.836
- It's not real.
- OK.

16:43.837 --> 16:46.156
You don't have it. You're cured.

16:46.157 --> 16:47.476
Oh, thank you.

16:47.477 --> 16:49.476
- He's very good.
- Look, Martin...

16:49.477 --> 16:50.477
Doctor.

16:50.478 --> 16:52.476
I apologise, let's reschedule.

16:52.477 --> 16:55.476
- No, I've done what was asked.
- I can't assess you on today.

16:55.477 --> 16:56.477
It was a total disaster.

16:56.478 --> 16:58.476
That's not my fault.
I have real patients

16:58.477 --> 17:00.476
with genuine medical conditions
that need my attention.

17:00.477 --> 17:04.476
No, no, no, Martin. I'm not
asking you, I'm telling you.

17:04.477 --> 17:06.476
I have fulfilled my obligation.
Goodbye.

17:06.477 --> 17:08.156
No, it's not over
until I say it's over.

17:08.156 --> 17:09.996
It's his stomach, Doc.

17:09.997 --> 17:12.476
He's been complaining about it
for days

17:12.477 --> 17:14.476
and he just doubled up
so I drove him straight here.

17:14.477 --> 17:15.477
Why hasn't he come to see me before?

17:15.478 --> 17:17.836
I told him,
but he said I was just whining.

17:17.837 --> 17:19.476
No, I never said that, Doc.

17:19.477 --> 17:22.476
Can you make your way through
to the consulting room?

17:22.477 --> 17:25.476
No, consultations are private,
thank you.

17:25.477 --> 17:27.477
Take care of him, Doc.

17:29.477 --> 17:32.316
Martin, I feel there's been
a terrible misunderstanding.

17:32.317 --> 17:34.476
Yes, there has. I have a patient.

17:34.477 --> 17:38.476
Come over here, lie down,
pull your shirt up.

17:38.477 --> 17:40.476
Do you have
a sharp, burning sensation

17:40.477 --> 17:42.476
immediately above your navel?

17:42.477 --> 17:43.477
Oh.

17:43.478 --> 17:46.569
I can't eat properly cos it hurts.

17:50.477 --> 17:54.476
Are you experiencing any stress
at the moment?

17:54.477 --> 17:57.476
The more you tell me,
the easier it is for me to help you.

17:57.477 --> 18:01.114
Dad died two years ago,
left us the farm.

18:01.317 --> 18:02.476
George really wants it
to be a success.

18:02.477 --> 18:04.476
It's like he wants to prove
something to Dad.

18:04.477 --> 18:08.476
But it's hard. We're skint and farms
everywhere are going bust.

18:08.477 --> 18:11.476
Some nights
I dream I'm a bird flying away,

18:11.477 --> 18:14.476
but even that gets stressful
cos of the wind and stuff

18:14.477 --> 18:16.476
and I'm scared of heights.

18:16.477 --> 18:20.476
I need a stool sample. I suspect
you have a duodenal ulcer.

18:20.477 --> 18:24.476
Take this jar.
Go to the lavatory next door,

18:24.477 --> 18:26.476
make an appointment
with the receptionist,

18:26.477 --> 18:29.659
come back
and get your test results.

18:31.477 --> 18:32.516
Is he OK?

18:32.517 --> 18:34.317
He's just there.

18:49.477 --> 18:50.477
What's that for?

18:50.478 --> 18:52.477
You know...

18:53.477 --> 18:55.477
Hardly necessary.

18:56.677 --> 18:58.476
I'm uncertain about the MO.

18:58.477 --> 19:00.476
These vehicles are
not particularly high-end.

19:00.477 --> 19:03.476
Doesn't fit the pattern that was
established by the Bude, Wadebridge,

19:03.477 --> 19:04.477
and Padstow thefts.

19:04.477 --> 19:05.477
Maybe they had bad intel.

19:05.478 --> 19:08.476
They expected better, but in
the end, just took what was there.

19:08.477 --> 19:09.477
Maybe.

19:09.478 --> 19:11.476
Did you check for tyre tracks?

19:11.477 --> 19:12.477
Yes.

19:12.478 --> 19:14.476
Of course.

19:14.477 --> 19:17.476
Although, I could always go back
up there, check again.

19:17.477 --> 19:18.477
I'd better come with you.

19:18.478 --> 19:20.476
It's possible
you've missed something.

19:20.477 --> 19:22.476
We'll head over in the morning.

19:22.477 --> 19:28.387
They'll probably be pleased to see
a proper policeman on the case.

19:36.477 --> 19:38.476
- Hello.
- Hello.

19:38.477 --> 19:40.316
How was college?

19:40.317 --> 19:42.476
Yes, it was pretty good. I've got
my first supervised session

19:42.477 --> 19:43.836
in a couple of weeks.

19:43.837 --> 19:45.476
And I was thinking,

19:45.477 --> 19:48.156
I was wondering if
I could use the phlebotomy room

19:48.157 --> 19:50.476
because you don't seem to use
that any more, do you?

19:50.477 --> 19:52.476
I didn't know you were planning
on doing it in there.

19:52.477 --> 19:54.316
I won't get in your way.

19:54.317 --> 19:56.476
That's what you said about
the tuition group.

19:56.477 --> 19:57.477
Um, yes.

19:57.478 --> 19:59.996
Of course, if you have to.

19:59.997 --> 20:03.476
I'll give it a fresh lick of paint.
It's a bit small and dingy.

20:03.477 --> 20:05.476
How did it go with
the mock patients?

20:05.477 --> 20:09.476
Oh, it was a shambles. The
supervising doctor was an imbecile.

20:09.477 --> 20:10.676
You didn't tell him that, did you?

20:10.677 --> 20:11.836
No, of course not.

20:11.837 --> 20:13.476
You say, "Of course I didn't," as if

20:13.477 --> 20:16.476
you've never called anyone
an imbecile before, Martin.

20:16.477 --> 20:19.476
I don't suppose anyone's
called about Buddy, have they?

20:19.477 --> 20:20.568
No, nothing.

20:22.477 --> 20:24.476
Sweet potatoes, broccoli,

20:24.477 --> 20:25.836
dark, leafy greens, mackerel,

20:25.837 --> 20:31.476
It's important you get as much
protein and calcium in your diet.

20:31.477 --> 20:34.476
When I'm pregnant, which I'm not.

20:34.477 --> 20:39.156
Had some study time today and I read
all about secondary infertility.

20:39.157 --> 20:40.317
You know...

20:41.477 --> 20:43.476
...impaired sperm production,

20:43.477 --> 20:45.476
and fallopian tube damage,

20:45.477 --> 20:48.476
and ovulation disorder,
and all that sort of thing.

20:48.477 --> 20:50.836
I think you're worrying about

20:50.837 --> 20:53.477
a fairly unlikely scenario.

20:55.477 --> 20:57.476
But if you like,
we could run some tests,

20:57.477 --> 21:00.476
check your hormone levels
and ovulation.

21:00.477 --> 21:01.841
28-day cycle...

21:03.477 --> 21:06.836
The best chance would be
the day after tomorrow.

21:06.837 --> 21:08.476
Book me in then.

21:08.477 --> 21:11.476
You don't need an appointment,
you're my wife.

21:11.477 --> 21:12.659
That's handy.

21:18.477 --> 21:21.476
You've had a liver transplant.
That's lucky,

21:21.477 --> 21:23.476
considering
your history with alcohol.

21:23.477 --> 21:26.476
On my way down from Bristol
yesterday, I started feeling ill.

21:26.477 --> 21:28.156
In what way?

21:28.157 --> 21:31.476
Just tired, I suppose,
like I haven't slept for weeks.

21:31.477 --> 21:33.205
Give me your wrist.

21:36.477 --> 21:39.476
You smell of smoke.
Have you started smoking again?

21:39.477 --> 21:40.477
No.

21:40.478 --> 21:42.476
That would be idiotic, wouldn't it,

21:42.477 --> 21:44.476
given your medical history,
if you started smoking again?

21:44.477 --> 21:46.023
I know that, Doc.

21:47.477 --> 21:48.676
Your blood pressure's high.

21:48.677 --> 21:50.476
You've put on a bit of weight too.

21:50.477 --> 21:52.476
Staying with my sister.
She feeds me well.

21:52.477 --> 21:54.476
- Are you taking immunosuppressants?
- Yeah.

21:54.477 --> 21:58.476
I'll prescribe chlorothiazide
for your blood pressure.

21:58.477 --> 22:00.476
Make sure you cut back on
your salt intake

22:00.477 --> 22:02.476
and no caffeine, no alcohol.

22:02.477 --> 22:04.477
And stop smoking.

22:10.157 --> 22:11.476
- Louisa!
- Oh!

22:11.477 --> 22:12.836
Mark.

22:12.837 --> 22:15.476
- I thought you were in...
- Poland. Yeah.

22:15.477 --> 22:16.477
I know.

22:16.478 --> 22:18.476
It's a bit of a story, that one.

22:18.477 --> 22:19.477
Yeah.

22:22.477 --> 22:24.476
In Exeter now.

22:24.477 --> 22:27.156
Back with the force. Sergeant.

22:27.157 --> 22:29.476
Well, good for you. You look well.

22:29.477 --> 22:32.476
I try to look after myself.

22:32.477 --> 22:33.996
You look good too.

22:33.997 --> 22:35.476
- Thank you.
- Healthy.

22:35.477 --> 22:37.476
I mean nice.

22:37.477 --> 22:39.476
Nice and healthy.

22:39.477 --> 22:41.676
You always did.
Still at the school, then?

22:41.677 --> 22:43.476
No, I've gone back to college.

22:43.477 --> 22:45.156
I'm training to be
a child counsellor.

22:45.157 --> 22:48.476
Oh, that'll explain
the pushchair, then.

22:48.477 --> 22:49.477
No, that's mine.

22:49.478 --> 22:51.476
Not mine, it's my son's.

22:51.477 --> 22:52.836
James. I've just dropped him off,
actually.

22:52.837 --> 22:54.476
I didn't know about that.

22:54.477 --> 22:57.836
Is the father still around or...?

22:57.837 --> 22:59.477
Yes, it's Martin.

23:02.477 --> 23:03.477
Wedding ring...

23:03.478 --> 23:05.476
which means
you probably married him.

23:05.477 --> 23:06.676
I did, yeah.

23:06.677 --> 23:08.476
That's great.

23:08.477 --> 23:10.476
Is it great?

23:10.477 --> 23:12.476
It is, yeah.

23:12.477 --> 23:14.476
That's great.

23:14.477 --> 23:16.476
Well,
I'd... love to stay and chat.

23:16.477 --> 23:18.476
But there's a big case.

23:18.477 --> 23:19.676
Criminals, that sort of thing.

23:19.677 --> 23:21.476
Better go.

23:21.477 --> 23:23.476
Oh, Mark, come here.

23:23.477 --> 23:26.476
- It's lovely to see you again.
- I know.

23:26.477 --> 23:27.477
I mean...

23:27.478 --> 23:30.476
me too.

23:30.477 --> 23:32.477
I mean... thank you.

23:55.228 --> 23:56.267
Sorry about yesterday.

23:56.268 --> 23:59.227
- I just didn't feel up to a big chat.
- No problem.

23:59.228 --> 24:01.587
- Would you like some breakfast?
- I can fix you something.

24:01.588 --> 24:03.587
No, you best sit down.

24:03.588 --> 24:05.227
I've been trying to think
how to say this.

24:05.228 --> 24:07.227
Maybe it's best
just to come out with it.

24:07.228 --> 24:09.227
- I'm selling the pub.
- What?

24:09.228 --> 24:12.227
But sales are...
I can show you the figures.

24:12.228 --> 24:15.227
- This place has never done so well.
- It's not you two, it's me.

24:15.228 --> 24:19.227
I just wanna cash in and move on.

24:19.228 --> 24:21.427
- I haven't been well.
- Yeah. We heard.

24:21.428 --> 24:24.227
I just want to see some of the world
before it's too late.

24:24.228 --> 24:26.227
Ken, let's discuss this.

24:26.228 --> 24:28.227
I didn't come here to discuss this.

24:28.228 --> 24:29.587
I come here to give you fair warning

24:29.588 --> 24:32.227
and first refusal to buy this place.

24:32.228 --> 24:33.907
We can't afford to buy the pub,

24:33.908 --> 24:36.227
even if you did give us
a generous discount.

24:36.228 --> 24:39.227
I said first refusal, not discount.

24:39.228 --> 24:40.228
Think about it.

24:40.228 --> 24:41.228
Here's Samantha's card.

24:41.229 --> 24:44.227
You'd best go through her.

24:44.228 --> 24:46.227
Ken, how are you?

24:46.228 --> 24:47.228
Good.

24:47.229 --> 24:52.048
Now that I've taken
the weight off my shoulders, Ruth.

24:52.228 --> 24:54.227
He seems happy.

24:54.228 --> 24:55.228
He's selling the pub from under us.

24:55.229 --> 24:59.227
Homeless, unemployed,
and it's not even ten o'clock.

24:59.228 --> 25:01.907
- Ruth.
- No.

25:01.908 --> 25:05.227
- I haven't said anything yet.
- I could see where it was going.

25:05.228 --> 25:06.907
And although I enjoyed...

25:06.908 --> 25:08.747
No, not enjoyed, appreciated

25:08.748 --> 25:11.227
my time in business with you both...

25:11.228 --> 25:13.227
- But, Ruth, it's making a profit.
- It's not the money.

25:13.228 --> 25:15.227
It's what Ken said.

25:15.228 --> 25:17.227
It's the weight on the shoulders.

25:17.228 --> 25:19.683
And I don't need it either.

25:27.228 --> 25:29.228
DOG BARKS

25:30.588 --> 25:32.228
Buddy? Buddy.

25:34.228 --> 25:35.908
Buddy!

25:37.228 --> 25:38.228
Buddy!

25:38.229 --> 25:39.588
Buddy.

25:47.228 --> 25:49.267
I still can't quite believe it
about Louisa and the doc.

25:49.268 --> 25:52.227
He and I were good friends
back in the day.

25:52.228 --> 25:54.907
Me and the doc are best friends now.

25:54.908 --> 25:56.363
- Really?
- Yeah.

25:58.228 --> 25:59.747
We get up to all sorts.

25:59.748 --> 26:01.227
Surprised
you've got the time for it.

26:01.228 --> 26:03.267
How many arrests have you made
in the past few years?

26:03.268 --> 26:06.227
Modern policing's about
crime prevention.

26:06.228 --> 26:08.227
Easy to say
when there's no crime around.

26:08.228 --> 26:10.227
I improved on your record.

26:10.228 --> 26:12.227
Yeah, you came into a village
that I transformed,

26:12.228 --> 26:14.227
and reaped
the benefits of my expertise.

26:14.228 --> 26:17.683
You went to Poland
to become a plumber.

26:18.228 --> 26:19.228
Why have you come back?

26:19.229 --> 26:20.866
It's a long story.

26:22.228 --> 26:25.227
You let me do the talking
up at the farm, all right?

26:25.228 --> 26:28.501
Exeter have got
a lot riding on this.

26:33.228 --> 26:35.228
Buddy.

26:47.068 --> 26:48.228
Hello?

26:53.228 --> 26:54.267
Buddy?

26:54.268 --> 26:56.227
Can I help you?
SHE GASPS

26:56.228 --> 26:57.228
Sorry, I've lost my dog.

26:57.229 --> 26:59.067
Is it dead?

26:59.068 --> 27:01.227
- What? No.
- This is the undertakers.

27:01.228 --> 27:04.956
- Oh.
- I think I can help you. Follow me.

27:09.228 --> 27:11.227
Oh, look, Buddy.

27:11.228 --> 27:14.227
Oh, we've been so worried.

27:14.228 --> 27:17.227
I'm sorry, he's very single-minded.

27:17.228 --> 27:18.747
He's been coming on and off
for a week.

27:18.748 --> 27:20.267
- I thought he was a stray.
- Sorry.

27:20.268 --> 27:21.747
I'm Julia.

27:21.748 --> 27:23.227
Oh, Louisa.

27:23.228 --> 27:26.067
- Hi!
- Have you just moved here?

27:26.068 --> 27:27.907
Heard someone was taking over
the undertakers.

27:27.908 --> 27:29.227
I inherited it.

27:29.228 --> 27:31.227
It just took ages,
getting everything sorted.

27:31.228 --> 27:34.227
It's tricky moving
when it's just yourself, and a dog,

27:34.228 --> 27:37.227
and a small child. Not in
any particular order of preference.

27:37.228 --> 27:39.747
- Oh, how old's your child?
- Arthur.

27:39.748 --> 27:41.227
He's nearly three.

27:41.228 --> 27:43.227
If you're looking for a nursery,
my son goes to Portwenn Tots

27:43.228 --> 27:45.227
up at the school
and it is really very good.

27:45.228 --> 27:46.228
I'll bear it in mind.

27:46.229 --> 27:49.227
Well, actually, while we're on
the subject of local knowledge,

27:49.228 --> 27:52.067
I need to introduce myself
to the village GP

27:52.068 --> 27:53.227
but I hear
he's something of an ogre.

27:53.228 --> 27:54.747
Oh, I don't know about that.

27:54.748 --> 27:57.227
Oh, no, everyone says
he's got a very short temper

27:57.228 --> 27:59.227
and an even shorter fuse.

27:59.228 --> 28:01.227
Yes, and he's also my husband, so...

28:01.228 --> 28:03.227
Oh!

28:03.228 --> 28:04.228
You should have let me keep talking.

28:04.229 --> 28:07.227
See how big a grave
I could have dug for myself.

28:07.228 --> 28:10.227
Yeah, well, we'll be getting
out your hair, then.

28:10.228 --> 28:14.501
- Sorry again about Buddy.
- Oh, we'll miss him.

28:22.068 --> 28:23.227
Any luck with Ken?

28:23.228 --> 28:24.228
No.

28:24.229 --> 28:26.227
Dad spoke to him about
lowering the price

28:26.228 --> 28:28.227
but he won't budge.

28:28.228 --> 28:30.227
He's just had a health scare,
hasn't he?

28:30.228 --> 28:31.228
Pretty big one, yeah.

28:31.229 --> 28:34.227
That can make someone reassess
their life.

28:34.228 --> 28:36.227
Sometimes they go too far,

28:36.228 --> 28:38.227
throw the baby out
with the bath water.

28:38.228 --> 28:39.427
So what are you saying?

28:39.428 --> 28:42.227
Don't try and negotiate the price.
It won't work.

28:42.228 --> 28:45.227
He's in a mindset
where selling is the only option.

28:45.228 --> 28:47.227
You have to try
and make him reconsider.

28:47.228 --> 28:48.907
I don't see how.

28:48.908 --> 28:51.227
He's had a transplant.

28:51.228 --> 28:54.227
Show him that a lump sum now
would be very ill-advised.

28:54.228 --> 28:58.227
A steady flow of income would be
much better for him.

28:58.228 --> 28:59.228
I see where you're going with that.

28:59.229 --> 29:00.267
Well, there you go.

29:00.268 --> 29:03.227
You and your father
are good salesmen.

29:03.228 --> 29:04.774
Sell him on that.

29:07.228 --> 29:08.410
Thanks, Ruth.

29:20.228 --> 29:23.319
Looks like they got a replacement.

29:39.228 --> 29:40.268
George!

29:47.228 --> 29:48.228
George!

29:48.229 --> 29:50.227
You need more authority
in your voice.

29:50.228 --> 29:52.228
George!

29:53.228 --> 29:55.227
George!

29:55.228 --> 29:57.228
- George!
- George!

29:58.228 --> 30:00.227
GEORGE!

30:00.228 --> 30:02.138
What's all the noise?

30:03.228 --> 30:05.227
Sergeant Mark Mylow.

30:05.228 --> 30:07.227
You're the aforementioned George,
then?

30:07.228 --> 30:08.427
I am.

30:08.428 --> 30:10.427
I didn't realise
we were getting more police in.

30:10.428 --> 30:14.227
You may have been victim of
a gang that's been targeting farms.

30:14.228 --> 30:18.227
Oh. I didn't know about that.
That's worrying.

30:18.228 --> 30:19.427
I see you've got a new tractor,
then.

30:19.428 --> 30:22.227
Yep, a mate of mine over Camelford
loaned it to us.

30:22.228 --> 30:25.227
I wanted to ask you
a few more questions.

30:25.228 --> 30:27.227
I'd love to help,
but maybe down at the station later.

30:27.228 --> 30:29.227
My brother here is not feeling
so good right now.

30:29.228 --> 30:31.227
That's fair enough.

30:31.228 --> 30:34.227
Are these the only roads
in and out of the farm?

30:34.228 --> 30:35.228
Yeah.

30:36.228 --> 30:39.227
I don't see
any significant tyre marks here

30:39.228 --> 30:41.227
or out in the lane.

30:41.228 --> 30:43.227
We had a storm
the night it happened.

30:43.228 --> 30:44.228
It must have washed any tracks away.

30:44.229 --> 30:47.227
That's right. That's why
I didn't find anything

30:47.228 --> 30:48.228
in my initial investigation.

30:48.229 --> 30:50.227
Where were your vehicles
locked away?

30:50.228 --> 30:52.227
In the main barn back there.

30:52.228 --> 30:53.747
That's actually all in my report.

30:53.748 --> 30:56.227
It doesn't do any harm
to double-check.

30:56.228 --> 30:58.227
I'm happy to go over everything
down at the station,

30:58.228 --> 31:00.227
but Billy needs his rest.

31:00.228 --> 31:02.587
Doc's already done a test on him.
We're waiting on results.

31:02.588 --> 31:04.227
Very well.

31:04.228 --> 31:06.227
You remember anything,

31:06.228 --> 31:07.228
call me.

31:13.228 --> 31:15.228
HE MOUTHS

31:25.228 --> 31:26.228
So...

31:27.268 --> 31:29.922
...you got into debt with Ruth?

31:29.923 --> 31:31.442
Massive debt, yeah.

31:31.443 --> 31:32.771
Ridiculous.

31:32.773 --> 31:35.094
How's that gonna convince me
not to sell?

31:35.095 --> 31:36.922
Because we paid it all back, Ken.

31:36.923 --> 31:38.922
We worked like crazy,
made all that money.

31:38.923 --> 31:42.922
That is the sort of level
of dedication we can give you.

31:42.923 --> 31:43.923
I don't know.

31:43.924 --> 31:46.122
Ken, I've known you a long time.

31:46.123 --> 31:48.922
You'll get a lump sum
and then you'll blow it on

31:48.923 --> 31:51.922
some extravagant world tour
which you won't enjoy

31:51.923 --> 31:53.922
and then you'll come back to
a wet and cold England

31:53.923 --> 31:56.282
with no assets and no cash.

31:56.283 --> 32:00.738
Or each month, you get that much
from the profits.

32:03.923 --> 32:05.922
OK.

32:05.923 --> 32:07.922
OK, we've got a deal?

32:07.923 --> 32:11.378
No. I meant,
"OK, I'll think about it."

32:11.923 --> 32:13.923
- Right.
- Oh.

32:16.923 --> 32:19.922
Your samples have shown the presence
of the Helicobacter bacteria.

32:19.923 --> 32:21.922
- Helicopter?
- Helicobacter.

32:21.923 --> 32:22.923
Germs that enter the body

32:22.924 --> 32:24.922
and live
in the lining of the stomach.

32:24.923 --> 32:26.922
But it does confirm that
you have an ulcer.

32:26.923 --> 32:28.602
It's not so bad.
I've had mouth ulcers before.

32:28.603 --> 32:30.922
Stomach ulcers can lead
to gastrointestinal bleeding

32:30.923 --> 32:31.923
or they can perforate,

32:31.924 --> 32:34.442
leaking the contents of your stomach
into your abdomen,

32:34.443 --> 32:36.922
- they're really quite bad.
- That's not helping, Doc.

32:36.923 --> 32:39.922
I'll write you a prescription
for two antibiotics and omeprazole.

32:39.923 --> 32:42.442
The omeprazole will stop
the production of acid,

32:42.443 --> 32:44.122
which will allow
the antibiotics to work.

32:44.123 --> 32:45.962
You should feel better
in a few days.

32:45.963 --> 32:49.922
Very important
that you take all three.

32:49.923 --> 32:52.922
Try drinking cold milk
to ease the burn from the acid.

32:52.923 --> 32:55.922
Eat little and often,
mainly fruit and vegetables.

32:55.923 --> 32:56.923
What's wrong with your hand?

32:56.924 --> 32:58.923
Let me see.

32:59.923 --> 33:02.922
Looks like contact dermatitis.
Have you been handling solvents?

33:02.923 --> 33:04.922
George had me painting the barn.

33:04.923 --> 33:07.122
Right, I'll write you another
prescription for some steroid cream.

33:07.123 --> 33:09.123
Put it on twice a day.

33:12.923 --> 33:16.287
- Feet.
- I need to go to the chemist.

33:19.923 --> 33:23.922
- Are you following us, Sergeant?
- No, I'm here to see the doc.

33:23.923 --> 33:25.922
If you're going to do more painting,
wear gloves and a mask.

33:25.923 --> 33:27.922
- Next patient.
- Me.

33:27.923 --> 33:30.922
- Come through.
- Don't suppose I could nip in first?

33:30.923 --> 33:32.602
I'm on the clock.

33:32.603 --> 33:34.282
You arrested me once for
noise disturbance.

33:34.283 --> 33:35.922
Yeah, well,
I have to keep the peace.

33:35.923 --> 33:39.469
I was singing happy birthday
to my wife.

33:39.763 --> 33:41.945
Must be nice being back.

33:47.923 --> 33:50.282
So, how come you're picking Mark up?

33:50.283 --> 33:52.922
Because his Lordship
wants driving round

33:52.923 --> 33:53.923
- while he's down here.
- Ah.

33:53.924 --> 33:55.922
No doubt saving on petrol
in his own car.

33:55.923 --> 33:57.922
I thought you two would get on (!)

33:57.923 --> 33:59.922
He's a pain in the you-know-what.

33:59.923 --> 34:01.922
- Mm.
- Thinks he's the big city cop.

34:01.923 --> 34:04.922
As if I can't solve the case
by myself.

34:04.923 --> 34:06.922
Have you solved it yet?

34:06.923 --> 34:08.922
No, but...

34:08.922 --> 34:11.283
I'm close. I can feel it.

34:13.922 --> 34:14.922
He said he'd be here by now.

34:14.924 --> 34:16.922
Hey, what's that?

34:16.922 --> 34:19.922
Look, there. It looks like paint.

34:24.283 --> 34:25.922
You beauty.

34:25.922 --> 34:28.922
- I thought you were waiting for Mark.
- Duty calls, Al.

34:28.922 --> 34:33.650
If you see Mark, tell him
Penhale's cracked the case.

34:37.922 --> 34:39.922
Is it bad, Doc?

34:39.922 --> 34:41.962
You can tell me.
Just nice and straight.

34:41.963 --> 34:43.922
Rip the plaster off.

34:43.922 --> 34:46.922
Well, your blood tests are clear

34:46.922 --> 34:49.922
and your hormone levels are normal

34:49.922 --> 34:51.601
but your urine sample

34:51.603 --> 34:53.922
confirms my suspicion
that you have prostatitis.

34:53.922 --> 34:55.763
Prostatitis.

34:56.922 --> 34:58.922
Oh, my God.

34:58.923 --> 34:59.923
I knew it.

35:02.923 --> 35:05.922
I think I'm in love with Louisa.

35:05.923 --> 35:08.196
I always have been and...

35:08.283 --> 35:11.922
...considering my condition now,
I just need you to say it, Doc.

35:11.923 --> 35:14.922
Er, prostatitis is a common,

35:14.923 --> 35:17.282
fairly minor infection
of the prostate gland.

35:17.283 --> 35:21.922
A course of antibiotics should
clear it up in a couple of weeks.

35:21.923 --> 35:24.282
So, just to check, no cancer?

35:24.283 --> 35:25.962
No cancer.

35:25.963 --> 35:28.123
Thank you, Doc.

35:31.923 --> 35:34.922
When you first arrived in Portwenn,
I didn't think you'd last

35:34.923 --> 35:38.922
but you've made a real life
for yourself here.

35:38.923 --> 35:40.762
Family, work, you even have a dog.

35:40.763 --> 35:42.922
You're a lucky man.

35:42.923 --> 35:43.923
Thank you.

35:57.923 --> 35:59.922
See you around, mate.

35:59.923 --> 36:03.378
- Your prescription.
- Ah, yeah, great.

36:03.923 --> 36:06.742
The Louisa thing, just kidding.

36:06.963 --> 36:10.145
Should have seen your face, though.

36:15.923 --> 36:16.923
What did Ken say?

36:16.924 --> 36:18.922
He said he'd think about it.

36:18.923 --> 36:21.442
Oh, it's never good when
Ken has to think about something.

36:21.443 --> 36:23.922
No, I reckon we just resign
ourselves to losing the place.

36:23.923 --> 36:29.196
Thanks for your advice anyway, Ruth.
It's much appreciated.

36:30.923 --> 36:32.922
Have you seen Penhale?
He's meant to be waiting for me.

36:32.923 --> 36:34.922
He was here. He rushed off.

36:34.923 --> 36:38.922
Said something about paint
and how he'd cracked the case.

36:38.923 --> 36:39.923
Oh, my God.

36:52.965 --> 36:55.984
Ken? It's Ruth.

36:55.986 --> 36:57.259
Hang on, Ruth.

37:00.146 --> 37:01.146
Come in.

37:04.146 --> 37:07.145
You know there's a £50 fine
for smoking in here?

37:07.146 --> 37:08.146
Seeing as I own the pub,

37:08.147 --> 37:10.145
I thought I'd let myself off.

37:10.146 --> 37:12.345
Don't tell anyone.

37:12.346 --> 37:14.145
Just the odd one.

37:14.146 --> 37:16.665
On condition that you give me
five minutes of your time

37:16.666 --> 37:17.985
to talk about Al and Bert.

37:17.986 --> 37:19.145
I know you've heard their pitch.

37:19.146 --> 37:23.965
But I've been in business with them
for quite a while.

37:24.146 --> 37:26.146
All right, then.

37:48.146 --> 37:49.146
Oi.

37:49.147 --> 37:51.145
You two. I know what happened.

37:51.146 --> 37:53.145
PC Penhale, what's happened?

37:53.146 --> 37:55.825
You pretended
your farming vehicles were stolen

37:55.826 --> 37:58.185
when really
you kept and repainted the tractor

37:58.186 --> 38:00.145
in an attempt to commit
insurance fraud.

38:00.146 --> 38:02.145
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

38:02.146 --> 38:06.145
Nice shade of red. Recent too.

38:06.146 --> 38:08.145
I imagine if
I check the chassis number,

38:08.146 --> 38:11.145
it'll be the same as
the "missing" vehicle?

38:11.146 --> 38:12.146
Billy, is this true?

38:12.147 --> 38:14.146
- What?
- Is it true?

38:15.146 --> 38:16.146
Look, Joe,

38:16.147 --> 38:18.145
if it turns out you're right,

38:18.146 --> 38:19.825
just go easy on the lad,

38:19.826 --> 38:23.145
he's had a tough time since our dad
died, not been thinking straight.

38:23.146 --> 38:25.146
SIREN

38:30.146 --> 38:31.146
I've cracked it.

38:31.147 --> 38:32.185
I cracked it.

38:32.186 --> 38:34.145
The doc told him to wear gloves

38:34.146 --> 38:35.146
- if he painted again.
- I know.

38:35.147 --> 38:37.145
- Check the chassis numbers.
- I was going to.

38:37.146 --> 38:39.145
We need to tread carefully.

38:39.146 --> 38:41.145
This operation is almost certainly
just the tip of the iceberg.

38:41.146 --> 38:42.665
What do you mean?

38:42.666 --> 38:45.145
How many vehicles have you stolen
in the last few months, eh?

38:45.146 --> 38:47.145
Stolen, painted,

38:47.146 --> 38:48.146
and moved on.

38:48.147 --> 38:50.145
You think George and Billy

38:50.146 --> 38:51.146
were behind the others too?

38:51.147 --> 38:53.145
They're a lot cleverer
than they look.

38:53.146 --> 38:55.145
There's no grand scheme.

38:55.146 --> 38:57.345
Just a poor lad
who made a silly decision.

38:57.346 --> 38:59.145
We'll see.

38:59.146 --> 39:02.601
This investigation
has only just begun.

39:04.146 --> 39:05.146
OK.

39:05.147 --> 39:09.145
OK, you're still thinking about it
or...

39:09.146 --> 39:12.146
OK, you've got a deal.

39:13.146 --> 39:14.146
Ruth has told me

39:14.147 --> 39:15.185
from first-hand experience

39:15.186 --> 39:17.185
the benefits of being in business
with you two.

39:17.186 --> 39:20.145
And as long as Al remains in charge,

39:20.146 --> 39:22.145
I'm happy to go ahead.

39:22.146 --> 39:23.146
I'm going nowhere, sir.

39:23.147 --> 39:25.145
Draw up the deal
and I'll sign it, then.

39:25.146 --> 39:27.825
We've already got one.
Just need to date it.

39:27.826 --> 39:31.145
I think this calls for
a large celebration.

39:31.146 --> 39:33.145
Actually, I've got to get packing.

39:33.146 --> 39:34.601
- Oh.
- Ooh, Ken.

39:35.666 --> 39:38.145
Here, let us get you
back to your room.

39:38.146 --> 39:39.505
Bert, call Martin.

39:39.506 --> 39:41.345
Tell him Ken's not well.

39:41.346 --> 39:43.145
I'll be right as rain in a minute.

39:43.146 --> 39:45.145
Bring up the papers
when you're ready.

39:45.146 --> 39:48.056
I'll be up in ten minutes, mate.

39:49.146 --> 39:50.505
PC Penhale,
check the chassis number.

39:50.506 --> 39:52.146
ENGINE STARTS

39:57.146 --> 39:59.145
Billy, no.

39:59.146 --> 40:01.145
I told you,
the boy's not right in the head.

40:01.146 --> 40:03.145
Prison would be tough on him.

40:03.146 --> 40:05.145
I'll take that into consideration.

40:05.146 --> 40:06.146
Billy, get down.

40:06.147 --> 40:08.145
- No.
- What's wrong with you?

40:08.146 --> 40:09.345
He read about the robberies
in the paper.

40:09.346 --> 40:12.145
He thought if
we pretended ours had been stolen,

40:12.146 --> 40:13.345
nobody'd get suspicious.

40:13.346 --> 40:16.145
Billy! Look, he's really not well.

40:16.146 --> 40:18.145
You think
Dad would have let this happen?

40:18.146 --> 40:21.145
Trying to save the farm
by scamming on the insurance?

40:21.146 --> 40:22.146
Argh!

40:22.147 --> 40:25.966
- Billy!
- He's passed out. Billy, get out!

40:26.146 --> 40:28.146
Out of the way!

40:32.146 --> 40:34.146
Billy!

40:42.666 --> 40:44.145
- Where is he?
- In his room resting.

40:44.146 --> 40:47.419
- Dad's with him.
- I'll show you up.

40:53.146 --> 40:55.145
- KNOCK ON DOOR
- Ken?

40:55.146 --> 40:59.145
- It's Dr Ellingham.
- What happened?

40:59.146 --> 41:02.874
He agreed to sign.
I was just helping him.

41:16.146 --> 41:17.146
He's dead.

41:17.147 --> 41:19.145
Bert.

41:19.146 --> 41:21.145
- It's what he would have wanted.
- What's been going on?

41:21.146 --> 41:23.145
- It stinks of smoke in here.
- I don't know.

41:23.146 --> 41:25.825
I just came up and saw him
lying there. There's no pulse.

41:25.826 --> 41:28.145
- Poor Ken.
- Must have had a heart attack.

41:28.146 --> 41:29.146
He didn't enjoy the best health.

41:29.147 --> 41:31.145
I'll let the coroner decide
what the cause was.

41:31.146 --> 41:33.146
Hello. Yes.

41:34.146 --> 41:35.825
What?

41:35.826 --> 41:38.145
Right. On my way.

41:38.146 --> 41:42.237
I have an emergency.
I'll call the undertaker.

41:44.146 --> 41:46.145
This is probably inappropriate,

41:46.146 --> 41:48.825
but who owns the pub now?

41:48.826 --> 41:51.145
- Dad, that's very inappropriate.
- Of course.

41:51.146 --> 41:53.145
- Bert, really?
- I know.

41:53.146 --> 41:54.328
You're right.

41:55.146 --> 41:57.146
I'm sorry, Ken.

41:58.346 --> 42:02.145
Stay with us. The doc's on his way.

42:02.146 --> 42:04.825
Sergeant Mylow?

42:04.826 --> 42:05.986
Mark?

42:09.506 --> 42:11.145
Stop it.

42:11.146 --> 42:13.145
Oh, I thought you were done for.

42:13.146 --> 42:15.825
- Where are they?
- They're not going anywhere.

42:15.826 --> 42:17.190
Here's the doc.

42:22.146 --> 42:24.145
- Doc.
- What happened?

42:24.146 --> 42:25.345
He got hit by a tractor.

42:25.346 --> 42:27.145
Ambulance is on its way.

42:27.146 --> 42:28.825
Where does it hurt?

42:28.826 --> 42:31.145
My leg, neck, and arm
on the left side.

42:31.146 --> 42:33.145
Billy was driving the tractor,

42:33.146 --> 42:35.145
passed out.

42:35.146 --> 42:36.146
Wiggle your toes.

42:36.147 --> 42:38.505
That's twice today
I've cheated death, doc.

42:38.506 --> 42:43.665
Mm. In my car in the boot, there's a
neck brace. Can you get it, please?

42:43.666 --> 42:47.146
- Stay there and don't move.
- Ah...

42:48.146 --> 42:49.510
Out of the way.

42:50.506 --> 42:53.145
All right, take it easy.
What's his name?

42:53.146 --> 42:55.145
- Billy.
- Relax. Breath deeply.

42:55.146 --> 42:57.146
BILLY PANTS

43:05.146 --> 43:07.145
I don't think
the ulcer's perforated.

43:07.146 --> 43:08.505
I'll give you a strong antacid.

43:08.506 --> 43:11.145
That should keep you going
until the ambulance gets here.

43:11.146 --> 43:15.874
- Could we have some water?
- Should be some in here.

43:17.146 --> 43:18.146
Here.

43:19.146 --> 43:20.146
That's it.

43:22.146 --> 43:23.237
And swallow.

43:24.146 --> 43:25.146
All right.

43:26.346 --> 43:27.985
Doc!

43:27.986 --> 43:30.145
You should have seen him, Doc.

43:30.146 --> 43:33.145
Threw himself in front of
the tractor to save George.

43:33.146 --> 43:35.145
- My arm.
- Sorry.

43:35.146 --> 43:36.146
Mate, the doc's here now.

43:36.147 --> 43:38.145
Talk about above and beyond
the call of duty.

43:38.146 --> 43:40.145
- Arm!
- No thought for his own wellbeing...

43:40.146 --> 43:43.145
My arm! You're kneeling on my arm!

43:43.146 --> 43:44.146
Oh, right, sorry.

43:44.147 --> 43:46.146
He's hurt his arm.

43:54.186 --> 43:56.145
You arrested the brothers?

43:56.146 --> 43:57.825
Attempt to defraud
the insurance company.

43:57.826 --> 44:00.145
And there's no link between them
and the big southwest robberies?

44:00.146 --> 44:02.665
It doesn't look like it,
but you can have the arrests.

44:02.666 --> 44:05.145
The way you threw yourself
in front of that tractor

44:05.146 --> 44:06.146
to save George's life.

44:06.147 --> 44:07.345
It was nothing.

44:07.346 --> 44:10.145
I suppose some people might call me
a hero.

44:10.146 --> 44:11.146
If they do that, I can't stop them.

44:11.147 --> 44:13.145
So what did happen in Poland?

44:13.146 --> 44:15.145
You keep saying it was a long story.

44:15.146 --> 44:17.145
It's for another time.

44:17.146 --> 44:20.145
Well, Poland's loss is
Devon and Cornwall Police's gain.

44:20.146 --> 44:22.825
It's been a pleasure serving
alongside you, Sergeant Mylow.

44:22.826 --> 44:24.145
Likewise, PC Penhale.

44:24.146 --> 44:27.665
It's good to know
Portwenn's in safe hands.

44:27.666 --> 44:30.146
- Argh!
- Sorry, I forgot.

44:43.146 --> 44:44.146
You all right?

44:44.146 --> 44:45.146
I don't like needles.

44:45.147 --> 44:46.985
Since when?

44:46.986 --> 44:48.145
Nobody likes needles, Martin.

44:48.146 --> 44:50.145
BUDDY BARKS

44:50.146 --> 44:51.146
Get out.

44:51.147 --> 44:54.145
Oh, he's just concerned about me.
Go on.

44:54.146 --> 44:56.145
It's lovely he's back in the house,
though, isn't it?

44:56.146 --> 44:58.145
Mm. So, this blood test

44:58.146 --> 45:00.145
will let us know
if you've ovulated or not

45:00.146 --> 45:03.665
by measuring the amount of
progesterone in your blood system.

45:03.666 --> 45:06.145
As today is day 21,
levels should be at their peak.

45:06.146 --> 45:08.145
Is this legal?

45:08.146 --> 45:09.505
You being my doctor?

45:09.506 --> 45:12.870
I'm not your doctor,
I'm your husband.

45:14.506 --> 45:16.145
- Ow.
- Sorry.

45:16.146 --> 45:19.328
I should have said "sharp scratch".

45:23.826 --> 45:25.146
There you go.

45:29.986 --> 45:31.145
Doc, you need to come,

45:31.146 --> 45:32.146
- someone's been shot.
- Where?

45:32.147 --> 45:34.185
I don't know.
It's not life-threatening,

45:34.186 --> 45:36.145
so I'm guessing the buttocks.

45:36.146 --> 45:37.146
He was stealing my eggs.

45:37.147 --> 45:39.145
- That's ridiculous.
- Been happening for weeks.

45:39.146 --> 45:41.145
It's nothing to do with me.

45:41.146 --> 45:43.145
Give it here. I'll do it.

45:43.146 --> 45:45.145
- Argh!
- Oh, my God.

45:45.146 --> 45:46.185
You were the one that was shot.

45:46.186 --> 45:48.145
Oh, most of us round here

45:48.146 --> 45:51.145
don't approve of shooting strangers.

45:51.146 --> 45:54.145
Now Julia's swollen up
like a beetroot balloon.

45:54.146 --> 45:58.237
So you'd better get here fast,
she needs help.
