WEBVTT

00:00.751 --> 00:03.418
(air whooshing)

00:11.840 --> 00:14.480
- [Steven] Well, you really
cleaned up the place for me.

00:14.530 --> 00:17.080
- [Caroline] Yeah, I, I
hope I can find your ID

00:17.130 --> 00:17.913
in this mess.

00:17.963 --> 00:20.904
- Yeah, it's going to be a
real needle in the haystack.

00:20.954 --> 00:22.823
- Or maybe it's right here.

00:23.930 --> 00:24.763
- Hmm.

00:28.280 --> 00:29.870
Thank you.

00:29.920 --> 00:30.753
- All good?

00:34.152 --> 00:35.088
You know, I coulda just

00:35.138 --> 00:36.040
given it back to you at the party tonight.

00:36.090 --> 00:37.090
- I was in the area.

00:40.120 --> 00:44.832
- Well, now that you've
got your school ID,

00:44.882 --> 00:46.313
where are you heading now?

00:48.640 --> 00:50.660
- Are you kicking me out?

00:50.710 --> 00:52.090
- I got stuff to do.

00:52.140 --> 00:53.850
- Yeah, clearly like tidying up.

00:53.900 --> 00:55.270
- You got a better suggestion?

00:55.320 --> 00:56.130
- Yeah, I've got an hour to kill

00:56.180 --> 00:57.630
before I have to go downtown.

00:59.240 --> 01:00.023
- An hour?

01:00.073 --> 01:00.991
An hour is all I get?

01:02.480 --> 01:05.093
- Uh, who said I was talking about you?

01:08.950 --> 01:09.783
Sorry.

01:11.770 --> 01:14.320
Hey, I just wanted to see you tonight

01:14.370 --> 01:17.893
and uh, hopefully before.

01:19.610 --> 01:21.123
Even though it's not much time.

01:25.368 --> 01:30.035
- Well uh, I'm sure we could
figure out something to do.

01:33.160 --> 01:33.993
- Something fun.

01:39.030 --> 01:40.370
It's a little hot in here.

01:40.420 --> 01:41.310
- Yeah.

01:41.360 --> 01:44.230
You know the radiator gets
too hot in the winter.

01:44.280 --> 01:45.663
It's kind of ironic.

01:47.520 --> 01:48.353
- Oh.

01:57.274 --> 01:59.010
- [Jun] It's like two thousand
dollars for a ticket, Ed.

01:59.060 --> 02:00.351
- I know, but there's gotta to be like

02:00.401 --> 02:02.700
cheaper prices somewhere.

02:02.750 --> 02:05.050
- I mean, maybe we buy our
tickets months in advance,

02:05.100 --> 02:08.900
but if I want to get to
South Africa this January

02:08.950 --> 02:11.003
it is literally two thousand dollars.

02:12.490 --> 02:14.230
- Well, I mean, couldn't you just like

02:14.280 --> 02:16.720
go on some sort of website or something?

02:16.770 --> 02:18.400
- I spent all night looking for deals

02:18.450 --> 02:19.900
and I couldn't find anything.

02:20.910 --> 02:22.340
I'm really sorry,

02:22.390 --> 02:23.262
but I just don't think I
can blow that much cash

02:23.312 --> 02:26.570
to see you for only a week.
- I mean, that makes sense.

02:26.620 --> 02:30.740
Like if the tickets are really that final.

02:30.790 --> 02:33.255
- You're the one that's been
nagging me to save money.

02:33.305 --> 02:35.100
- I know, I know.

02:35.150 --> 02:37.823
I just know like I'm going
to miss you, you know?

02:38.943 --> 02:41.193
I really wanted my family to meet you.

02:45.980 --> 02:47.090
Actually you know what?

02:47.140 --> 02:49.190
Don't, don't worry about it, okay?

02:49.240 --> 02:50.633
It's cool, it's fine.

02:53.305 --> 02:54.138
- I'm sorry.

02:55.730 --> 02:57.070
- Don't worry about it.

02:57.120 --> 02:59.300
- But winter break will fly by.

02:59.350 --> 03:00.503
- No, it won't.

03:03.721 --> 03:04.554
But that's okay.

03:06.856 --> 03:07.810
- [Laura] You know,

03:07.860 --> 03:08.903
you're not supposed to eat
ice cream in the winter.

03:10.373 --> 03:12.160
- [Charlie] I don't care,
I'm going to do it anyway

03:12.210 --> 03:14.110
'cause I do it all the time back home.

03:15.423 --> 03:17.973
- I guess things get pretty
crazy in the wild West.

03:20.680 --> 03:21.513
California?

03:23.311 --> 03:24.880
(laughter)

03:24.930 --> 03:25.763
- Sure.

03:26.890 --> 03:28.520
Well, I guess I'll have to send a postcard

03:28.570 --> 03:30.390
from the frontier.

03:30.440 --> 03:33.833
- And I'll send one back to
my lone cowboy out there.

03:35.710 --> 03:38.346
- Hey, so are you going to
come to that Christmas party

03:38.396 --> 03:39.930
I was telling you about?

03:39.980 --> 03:41.420
- Definitely.

03:41.470 --> 03:42.303
- Awesome.

03:53.510 --> 03:55.740
Look I, I just don't want
to overstep any boundaries.

03:55.790 --> 03:57.210
If he wouldn't be cool with it then,

03:57.260 --> 04:00.390
- Charlie, I'm cool with it.

04:10.240 --> 04:11.350
- Thanks.

04:11.400 --> 04:13.560
- You don't need to thank me.

04:16.123 --> 04:19.010
- Well, I'm sorry to run out
now, but I'll see you there.

04:19.060 --> 04:19.893
- Totally.

04:20.877 --> 04:21.983
- Great.

04:23.610 --> 04:25.260
- And uh, about the party tonight

04:27.791 --> 04:29.041
I hope there's mistletoe.

04:38.444 --> 04:39.300
- [Caroline] Come on,
we're going to be late.

04:39.350 --> 04:41.773
Don't worry about it, Jun come on.

04:43.280 --> 04:45.300
- [Jun] I think she moved her stash.

04:45.350 --> 04:47.530
Faye might be on to us.

04:47.580 --> 04:48.883
- My gosh, does that mean

04:49.918 --> 04:50.770
that we shouldn't steal her weed anymore?

04:50.820 --> 04:52.960
- She gets high and eats all my food.

04:53.010 --> 04:55.500
I don't think it's the end of
the world if we take a bit.

04:55.550 --> 04:56.640
An eye for an eye.

04:56.690 --> 05:00.060
- Okay, but like I've gotten
high and eat your food.

05:00.110 --> 05:01.023
- I've noticed.

05:03.380 --> 05:04.213
Found it.

05:06.670 --> 05:08.763
I'm taking less than a
gram this time anyway,

05:09.630 --> 05:11.070
unless you want some.

05:11.120 --> 05:12.770
- Uh no, I'm not smoking tonight.

05:14.495 --> 05:15.828
- Suit yourself.

05:17.338 --> 05:18.820
What's that for?

05:18.870 --> 05:20.070
- Oh, this is blackmail.

05:25.810 --> 05:27.290
Nice.

05:27.340 --> 05:29.203
Don't worry, I'm just
sending it to the boys.

05:30.101 --> 05:34.230
- Shit, Manny, I've been cleaning
up this apartment all day.

05:34.280 --> 05:35.650
Why do you think I've been doing that?

05:35.700 --> 05:36.483
I thought we were gathering a few pals,

05:36.533 --> 05:37.470
not throwing a rager.

05:37.520 --> 05:38.952
- Hey.

05:39.002 --> 05:39.955
- Hi.

05:40.005 --> 05:40.954
- How's it going boys?

05:41.004 --> 05:41.953
- [Ed] Hey uh,

05:42.003 --> 05:45.550
so we might be in a
little bit of a conundrum.

05:45.600 --> 05:48.290
A few more people were
invited than expected.

05:48.340 --> 05:50.650
- It's not any specific person's fault.

05:50.700 --> 05:52.840
- It looks like someone's
going on the naughty list.

05:52.890 --> 05:54.500
- Okay, the more the merrier.

05:54.550 --> 05:57.880
- Things won't be very merry
if there's not enough alcohol.

05:57.930 --> 06:00.230
- [Caroline] So either we
have to turn people away

06:00.280 --> 06:03.163
or someone's going to have to
go out and get more drinks.

06:08.060 --> 06:10.140
- Charlie, you want to
pick up some booze for us?

06:10.190 --> 06:11.770
- No, Laura's going to be here any second

06:11.820 --> 06:13.823
and I kind of want to be here for that.

06:15.310 --> 06:17.150
- What about all the
people I got coming over?

06:17.200 --> 06:19.800
- Manny, it's your fault
so I think it's on you bro.

06:23.330 --> 06:25.230
- Fuck fine.

06:25.280 --> 06:26.980
- Don't get lost out there, Manny.

06:27.860 --> 06:29.890
- Don't worry, Rudolph knows the way.

06:29.940 --> 06:30.790
- You're amazing.

06:35.170 --> 06:36.730
- You invited Laura.

06:36.780 --> 06:38.537
What's going on with that?

06:39.680 --> 06:40.570
- You got a sec actually?

06:40.620 --> 06:42.573
- [Steven] Manny, Manny, Manny, Manny.

06:46.524 --> 06:48.417
Uh, found someone better.

06:48.467 --> 06:50.340
- Hi, give me like one second.

06:50.390 --> 06:52.270
I gotta talk to Charlie about something.

06:52.320 --> 06:53.550
- Yeah, fine,

06:53.600 --> 06:55.714
just tell Manny to
bring the booze up okay?

06:55.764 --> 06:56.597
- Okay.

07:00.840 --> 07:02.810
- [Charlie] I should be happy, right?

07:02.860 --> 07:04.510
I should be happy, but I'm worried

07:04.560 --> 07:08.083
and this whole long distance
open relationship is,

07:08.133 --> 07:11.280
- Did the date go well?

07:11.330 --> 07:13.110
- [Charlie] Yeah, yes, it went great.

07:13.160 --> 07:13.993
It's just,

07:15.200 --> 07:17.500
- You want her to break
up with her boyfriend?

07:18.370 --> 07:19.673
- No.

07:19.723 --> 07:21.830
- Yeah.

07:21.880 --> 07:23.633
- But like, yeah right.

07:27.260 --> 07:28.093
Yeah, I do.

07:29.680 --> 07:34.027
- Okay look the whole open
relationship long distance thing

07:34.077 --> 07:36.293
it's a, it's a rookie move.

07:37.640 --> 07:39.120
I bet she's not even that invested.

07:39.170 --> 07:42.280
- Yes, yes and why should I be worried

07:42.330 --> 07:44.390
about ruining her relationship with Greg

07:44.440 --> 07:48.220
if she's just going to be
here and he's going to be,

07:48.270 --> 07:49.053
- Having sex with other people

07:49.103 --> 07:50.657
on the other side of the country.

07:54.122 --> 07:55.260
- I should have did something.

07:55.310 --> 07:56.570
- Yeah.

07:56.620 --> 07:59.703
You and anyone that's ever
been in a relationship ever.

08:01.480 --> 08:03.730
(grunting)

08:05.420 --> 08:06.723
- [Caroline] Hi.

08:06.773 --> 08:07.726
Hey Mr.

08:07.776 --> 08:08.559
- Hey you.

08:08.609 --> 08:09.442
What's up?

08:12.593 --> 08:14.313
- This roof is great for parties.

08:16.850 --> 08:18.800
- Technically we are not
supposed to have alcohol up here

08:18.850 --> 08:20.240
for safety reasons.

08:20.290 --> 08:21.853
- Charlie, you mind?

08:23.540 --> 08:24.373
- Sure.

08:30.004 --> 08:31.004
- Come here.

08:32.930 --> 08:33.910
- What's up?

08:33.960 --> 08:35.400
- What's up with you?

08:35.450 --> 08:37.280
- Why'd you you have Charlie leave?

08:37.330 --> 08:38.323
- I don't know,

08:38.373 --> 08:40.130
maybe I wanted to spend
some alone time with you.

08:40.180 --> 08:42.724
- Okay, well you didn't
have to be an ass about it.

08:42.774 --> 08:43.607
- Okay.

08:44.681 --> 08:46.365
Well, you know, I can always
call him back if you'd like.

08:46.415 --> 08:47.198
- Would you mind?

08:47.248 --> 08:48.379
- Yeah?

08:48.429 --> 08:49.386
- Yeah, can you just.

08:49.436 --> 08:50.388
- Charlie!

08:50.438 --> 08:51.404
- Charlie!

08:51.454 --> 08:52.287
- Charlie!

08:53.770 --> 08:54.560
Then again you know,

08:54.610 --> 08:57.193
I'm not going to see ya
till after break, so.

08:58.210 --> 08:59.410
- Are you gonna miss me?

09:07.939 --> 09:10.772
- You make it difficult, you know?

09:15.128 --> 09:15.911
You know, I've always wanted to see

09:15.961 --> 09:17.380
the Rockefeller tree on Christmas.

09:19.770 --> 09:22.073
- I don't know, it's just a big tree.

09:23.230 --> 09:24.193
- Yeah, no shit.

09:25.377 --> 09:27.427
So it's a really big, really pretty tree.

09:29.159 --> 09:30.920
- What, you don't like?

09:30.970 --> 09:32.708
You don't like trees?

09:32.758 --> 09:33.710
Are you too cool for trees?

09:33.760 --> 09:35.912
I'm Steven, I'm too cool for trees.

09:35.962 --> 09:36.911
- Okay.

09:36.961 --> 09:38.570
I don't know, maybe my dad
didn't let us have a tree, so.

09:38.620 --> 09:39.806
- What?

09:39.856 --> 09:40.950
No, everyone has a tree.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.830
- Well, when my dad was a kid,

09:42.880 --> 09:45.730
his house kind of burnt
down when the Christmas tree

09:45.780 --> 09:46.781
caught on fire.

09:46.831 --> 09:47.900
Yeah.

09:47.950 --> 09:50.097
- Oh my God, that's insane.

09:51.160 --> 09:53.342
Wait, wait, so my parents
are divorced right?

09:53.392 --> 09:54.175
- Okay.

09:54.225 --> 09:58.810
- So I had two Christmas
trees while you had none.

10:01.420 --> 10:02.623
- Don't rub it in.

10:08.770 --> 10:12.777
- I can see, Christmas
decorations are nice though.

10:14.140 --> 10:17.763
All December, the lights, snow.

10:19.390 --> 10:20.740
It's romantic, isn't it?

10:20.790 --> 10:23.380
- Oh, I could do without the weather.

10:23.430 --> 10:24.761
- Oh, come on.

10:24.811 --> 10:26.650
Look at the view, tell
me it's not beautiful.

10:26.700 --> 10:28.566
Honestly, it's a really pretty night

10:28.616 --> 10:31.973
only thing prettier seems to be you.

10:35.970 --> 10:37.390
What?

10:37.440 --> 10:38.273
- Nothing, nothing.

10:39.350 --> 10:40.183
- Okay.

10:41.650 --> 10:44.710
- It's just you've given
me that line before

10:44.760 --> 10:45.810
you know that, right?

10:47.020 --> 10:48.122
- Sure.

10:48.172 --> 10:50.665
- Like those exact same words.

10:50.715 --> 10:52.883
- I didn't realize it was
illegal to repeat yourself.

10:55.640 --> 10:58.450
Look, why don't we just take our drinks,

10:58.500 --> 11:00.730
curl up in our room for a bit.

11:00.780 --> 11:02.060
It's cold out here.

11:02.110 --> 11:03.460
- And miss the whole party?

11:05.480 --> 11:07.780
- I'm sure we'll come
up with something to do.

11:09.667 --> 11:12.280
- You know, one of these days

11:12.330 --> 11:14.043
you're gonna have to
take me out to dinner.

11:16.050 --> 11:21.050
- Yeah, but we're not really about that.

11:21.440 --> 11:22.630
Are we?

11:22.680 --> 11:23.780
- What does that mean?

11:24.730 --> 11:25.513
- [Charlie] It means what it means,

11:25.563 --> 11:27.150
we're not really about that.

11:27.200 --> 11:28.866
- How are we not about that? We're dating.

11:30.760 --> 11:32.410
- You think we're dating, dating?

11:33.387 --> 11:35.260
- [Caroline] I mean, what
else would you call this?

11:35.310 --> 11:36.840
A fling.

11:36.890 --> 11:39.170
I think we're a little bit past that.

11:39.220 --> 11:41.380
- [Charlie] Okay, well have
we been on any dates before?

11:41.430 --> 11:43.280
- [Caroline] We've been on three dates.

11:43.330 --> 11:45.723
- No, we've been to
three parties together.

11:45.773 --> 11:47.173
- Well, we've had sex twice.

11:48.190 --> 11:52.793
- Look, forgive me for not
wanting to be serious yet.

11:53.770 --> 11:56.590
- So we're just a fling?

11:57.720 --> 11:58.710
- Yeah.

11:58.760 --> 11:59.543
- [Caroline] Okay, cool.

11:59.593 --> 12:02.534
Yeah, that's fine,
that's fine, that's fine.

12:02.584 --> 12:05.020
I'm gonna, I'm gonna go to the bathroom

12:05.070 --> 12:08.876
but I'll be like one
sec, I'll be right back.

12:08.926 --> 12:11.509
(subtle music)

12:25.343 --> 12:26.600
- I really love all those little places

12:26.650 --> 12:27.890
you find in Greenwich village, you know?

12:27.940 --> 12:28.860
- I know what you mean, man.

12:28.910 --> 12:31.200
It has like this great bar scene, right?

12:31.250 --> 12:32.810
Especially at night, you know?

12:32.860 --> 12:33.920
Imagine I live right,

12:33.970 --> 12:36.014
- Let's not fall off the roof.

12:36.064 --> 12:38.730
All right, gnarly party am I right?

12:38.780 --> 12:41.460
Oh my God, are you Steve?

12:41.510 --> 12:42.738
- What's your name?

12:42.788 --> 12:43.940
- I mean, I heard he was
good looking but come on.

12:43.990 --> 12:45.420
Come on, are you kidding me?

12:45.470 --> 12:48.666
Look at this guy's jaw
line, that's ridiculous.

12:48.716 --> 12:49.666
Is that real?

12:49.716 --> 12:50.670
- I don't see it.

12:50.720 --> 12:52.340
- Oh my God.

12:52.390 --> 12:54.440
- Thank you sir, appreciate it.

12:54.490 --> 12:55.450
- Hey, it's nice to meet you, man.

12:55.500 --> 12:56.580
- Steven, this is Bud.

12:56.630 --> 12:58.285
- Oh Bud, what's up brother?

12:58.335 --> 12:59.285
How you doing?

12:59.335 --> 13:00.294
- I'm good, I'm good.

13:00.344 --> 13:01.569
- How are you?

13:01.619 --> 13:03.200
- And who's this?

13:03.250 --> 13:05.180
- Serena, this is Serena.

13:05.230 --> 13:06.013
- [Melissa] Yeah, honestly like

13:06.063 --> 13:07.230
don't even worry about Serena.

13:07.280 --> 13:10.080
I'm Melissa, nice to meet you.

13:10.130 --> 13:12.100
She's fine, like she's chilling.

13:12.150 --> 13:13.930
- Why don't we take Serena off the roof

13:13.980 --> 13:15.270
before she falls off?

13:15.320 --> 13:16.260
- That's actually a good idea.

13:16.310 --> 13:17.143
- Great.

13:18.004 --> 13:18.971
- He's smart.

13:19.021 --> 13:19.971
- [Melissa] Yeah.

13:20.021 --> 13:21.521
- Am I in trouble?

13:23.809 --> 13:25.510
- She's cute man.

13:25.560 --> 13:26.393
- Yo, Melissa.

13:27.270 --> 13:28.113
What's the rush?

13:29.844 --> 13:30.760
- [Melissa] What's with
the sudden interest?

13:30.810 --> 13:32.200
- [Steven] Gotta take
care of my guests right?

13:32.250 --> 13:33.700
Any complaints?

13:33.750 --> 13:36.063
- Yeah, this one guy on your
roof's a bit of a prick.

13:38.544 --> 13:43.544
- Damn, don't talk about
poor Bud like that.

13:44.768 --> 13:46.543
- I'm gonna just uh, I'm
gonna just head in, right.

13:48.860 --> 13:51.750
- So last night in the city, huh?

13:54.403 --> 13:56.310
- [Caroline] Charlie, do we
have anything left to drink?

13:56.360 --> 14:00.483
- We are pretty much
dry, but we do have this.

14:01.540 --> 14:04.577
That's kinda it so we're, oh.

14:07.149 --> 14:07.982
Okay.

14:09.710 --> 14:10.543
Hey Laura.

14:14.250 --> 14:15.330
- Who's this?

14:15.380 --> 14:17.110
- This is Caroline.

14:17.160 --> 14:18.110
- Oh wait, you're Laura.

14:18.160 --> 14:19.770
Hi, it's nice to meet you.

14:19.820 --> 14:21.460
I've heard, Charlie told me all about you.

14:21.510 --> 14:24.718
- Charlie hasn't really
told me much about you.

14:24.768 --> 14:25.685
- Oh, okay.

14:26.842 --> 14:30.738
- Yes, let's get this party going again.

14:30.788 --> 14:33.371
(upbeat music)

14:37.462 --> 14:39.084
- Oh my God!

14:39.134 --> 14:40.801
What the fuck bitch?

14:46.664 --> 14:49.520
- Give me the paper towels.

14:49.570 --> 14:50.403
- Fuck.

15:14.510 --> 15:15.293
- Hey.

15:15.343 --> 15:16.643
Can you help me out?

15:18.350 --> 15:19.183
- Yeah.

15:20.814 --> 15:24.564
- Try not to look at
it, it is fucking gross.

15:29.350 --> 15:30.133
Hey, are you okay?

15:30.183 --> 15:33.080
You just seem a little off
and I wanted to check in.

15:33.130 --> 15:34.490
- Yeah, I'm fine.

15:34.540 --> 15:35.488
- Right.

15:35.538 --> 15:38.723
- I mean, this is not how
I expected my night to go.

15:43.430 --> 15:45.003
- Well you know what?

15:45.053 --> 15:47.180
I got this, you should be having fun.

15:47.230 --> 15:48.863
You should go hang out with Steven.

15:55.660 --> 15:56.493
You okay?

16:01.000 --> 16:03.600
- Do you ever think about
how much time you waste on

16:04.580 --> 16:05.693
utter bullshit?

16:07.030 --> 16:07.863
- All the time.

16:10.240 --> 16:14.320
But cleaning up vomit comes
with the package, I guess.

16:15.852 --> 16:19.400
As long as you're all
right, then I'm good.

16:19.450 --> 16:21.913
- I'm fine, everything's fine.

16:25.586 --> 16:27.878
- You know, I actually uh,

16:27.928 --> 16:29.000
I always thought you
were too good for him.

16:29.050 --> 16:30.370
- Excuse me?

16:30.420 --> 16:32.000
- I got to say it.

16:32.050 --> 16:33.890
Steven can be a real prick sometimes

16:33.940 --> 16:35.750
and I don't know why
he's pulling right now,

16:35.800 --> 16:37.033
but I can guess.

16:46.183 --> 16:48.100
- Do us a favor, buddy.

16:50.240 --> 16:51.963
Show us it all works out sometimes.

16:58.949 --> 17:01.532
(subtle music)

17:16.720 --> 17:17.563
Jun, hey!

17:19.270 --> 17:20.780
What's up?

17:20.830 --> 17:25.050
- [Jun] I'm just heading back
to the apartment to change.

17:25.100 --> 17:27.510
- [Caroline] Okay, you gonna come back?

17:27.560 --> 17:29.480
- Nah, I think I'm done for tonight.

17:31.360 --> 17:32.193
- Yeah.

17:33.380 --> 17:34.860
I gotta go to the bathroom,

17:34.910 --> 17:35.977
but do you wanna come
back upstairs with me

17:36.027 --> 17:38.055
and we could say goodbye to Ed and Charlie

17:38.105 --> 17:39.913
and then we can go home?

17:41.360 --> 17:44.393
- I don't really want to see Ed right now.

17:45.555 --> 17:46.723
- Why, did something happen?

17:48.290 --> 17:49.450
- I'll tell you about it later.

17:49.500 --> 17:51.300
I have to get out of this shirt, so.

17:52.288 --> 17:56.323
- I'm sorry about
whatever happened with Ed.

17:58.396 --> 18:00.120
Wait vomit, you literally just.

18:00.170 --> 18:01.520
- I'm going to go.

18:01.570 --> 18:02.544
- I'll see you later.

18:02.594 --> 18:03.552
- Yeah.

18:03.602 --> 18:04.385
- Goodnight.

18:04.435 --> 18:05.268
Merry Christmas.

18:19.338 --> 18:21.921
(subtle music)

18:30.000 --> 18:31.150
- [Charlie] Hey Steven?

18:35.380 --> 18:37.057
- Sorry Charlie, you mind?

18:38.164 --> 18:39.112
- [Charlie] Hey, do you mind?

18:39.162 --> 18:41.333
I need to talk hosting with
my roommate in private.

18:42.650 --> 18:44.213
- Okay, should I leave?

18:47.540 --> 18:48.633
- Give us a second.

18:49.679 --> 18:50.513
- [Charlie] Roof top now.

18:53.670 --> 18:55.380
- Wait for me, all right?

19:05.908 --> 19:07.420
- I can't believe you, Steven.

19:07.470 --> 19:08.810
Of all the manipulative
things you've done,

19:08.860 --> 19:12.005
cheating on someone when
they're in the next room.

19:12.055 --> 19:13.220
- Dude, what are you talking about?

19:13.270 --> 19:15.320
- Why are you being so awful to Caroline?

19:16.360 --> 19:18.750
- Okay first, Caroline's fine.

19:18.800 --> 19:20.132
Right?

19:20.182 --> 19:21.124
Quit being such a white Knight.

19:21.174 --> 19:23.007
- I'm not sure she is.

19:45.477 --> 19:46.553
- Yo bud.

19:46.603 --> 19:47.623
Mike let's bounce.

19:49.650 --> 19:51.023
- Yeah, let's bail.

19:54.820 --> 19:56.230
- Yo Mike?

19:56.280 --> 19:57.140
You seen Caroline?

19:57.190 --> 19:59.490
- [Mike] Uh yeah, she's
around here somewhere.

20:06.587 --> 20:07.420
- Hey.

20:09.484 --> 20:10.317
- Hey.

20:14.516 --> 20:16.272
- What do you want?

20:16.322 --> 20:18.239
- Can we talk upstairs?

20:47.167 --> 20:48.885
- Party treating you all right?

20:48.935 --> 20:53.510
- Yeah, it's your average
mediocre college party.

20:53.560 --> 20:56.660
Drugs and drinks and disappointment.

20:56.710 --> 20:58.000
Sorry to hear about that, I'm stupid.

20:58.050 --> 20:58.883
- No you're not.

21:01.820 --> 21:03.960
Steven, why don't you want to date me?

21:04.010 --> 21:06.480
Is it something I said, is
it, is it the way that I'm,

21:06.530 --> 21:07.313
- No it's not.

21:07.363 --> 21:09.373
- Oh, it's not you it's me.

21:10.277 --> 21:11.130
Seriously?

21:11.180 --> 21:12.373
That's the line you're gonna give me?

21:12.423 --> 21:13.206
- Okay, listen.

21:13.256 --> 21:15.630
The whole committed
relationship, you know,

21:15.680 --> 21:19.220
eternal love and all that horse shit.

21:19.270 --> 21:20.103
I've been there.

21:20.970 --> 21:21.753
- Have you?

21:21.803 --> 21:23.460
I couldn't tell from the limited effort

21:23.510 --> 21:24.293
that you put into this relationship.

21:24.343 --> 21:27.343
- Okay calm down, really for a second.

21:28.580 --> 21:31.985
You know, back in high school,
I used to have this girl

21:32.035 --> 21:36.363
and we used to skip class
and drive around in her car.

21:37.833 --> 21:38.616
- She sounds like something.

21:38.666 --> 21:39.499
- She was.

21:40.360 --> 21:42.860
Charming, loudmouthed.

21:42.910 --> 21:43.700
A bit all over the place,

21:43.750 --> 21:46.100
but like in the most
entertaining way possible.

21:49.010 --> 21:49.860
- How did it end?

21:54.810 --> 21:56.160
- Saw her with another guy.

21:57.090 --> 21:59.440
No warning just happened, you know?

21:59.490 --> 22:02.510
And she told me that
I needed to understand

22:02.560 --> 22:04.083
my place in her life.

22:05.140 --> 22:06.640
Even though I thought we were,

22:09.900 --> 22:13.360
I didn't know you could use
another human being like that.

22:13.410 --> 22:14.810
- No, you know what, Steven?

22:16.220 --> 22:18.590
I don't want your emotional
baggage on my doorstep.

22:18.640 --> 22:20.380
- Sorry for the burden.

22:20.430 --> 22:21.700
- No, no, you know what?

22:21.750 --> 22:23.330
Fuck this, fuck you.

22:23.380 --> 22:25.340
Your head is so far up your ass.

22:25.390 --> 22:27.980
I don't want to be
having this conversation.

22:28.030 --> 22:29.610
I want to have a good time tonight.

22:29.660 --> 22:30.483
What do you want from me?

22:30.533 --> 22:33.040
- [Steven] I just, please just,

22:33.090 --> 22:35.040
I just want to say I'm sorry.

22:35.090 --> 22:36.453
I'm sorry that you that,

22:37.310 --> 22:38.700
I'm sorry that I made you feel like

22:38.750 --> 22:40.790
we were something we weren't.

22:40.840 --> 22:42.693
- No, it's, it's fine.

22:43.530 --> 22:46.980
It's totally fine that we're a fling

22:47.030 --> 22:48.680
'cause now I know where we stand.

22:50.375 --> 22:52.290
You know, it opens me up.

22:52.340 --> 22:54.390
There's a lot of cute guys at this party.

22:57.090 --> 22:58.490
- No one's holding you back.

23:10.770 --> 23:12.353
- [Steven] Manny, where are you?

23:12.403 --> 23:13.592
At the party?

23:13.642 --> 23:15.142
Where's the booze?

23:16.260 --> 23:17.043
Down the street?

23:17.093 --> 23:18.393
Whose place?

23:22.280 --> 23:23.070
Let me get this straight,

23:23.120 --> 23:25.893
you're at a different
party instead of your own,

23:26.980 --> 23:28.120
the last party that all of these boys

23:28.170 --> 23:29.670
are going to be at for months?

23:34.600 --> 23:36.640
Yeah, the party, the party is fine.

23:36.690 --> 23:40.647
It's not the same without you.

23:46.457 --> 23:47.710
You got to go already?

23:47.760 --> 23:48.593
All right.

23:52.930 --> 23:54.480
Yeah, I'll see you soon, buddy.

24:07.810 --> 24:09.730
- Hey, what's going on?

24:12.240 --> 24:14.090
- I don't know.

24:14.140 --> 24:15.953
I think I just screwed up.

24:29.220 --> 24:31.393
- Well, you can't be having
a worst night than she is.

24:37.840 --> 24:40.383
- Hey, party's still going?

24:42.242 --> 24:44.813
- Not really man.

24:44.863 --> 24:46.823
People mostly went home.

24:47.905 --> 24:48.738
Are you good?

24:49.580 --> 24:50.413
- Yeah.

24:51.690 --> 24:52.673
I have cookies.

24:53.590 --> 24:54.493
- Like edibles?

25:00.360 --> 25:01.210
- Oatmeal raisin.

25:02.060 --> 25:03.710
- Sure, yeah whatever.

25:03.760 --> 25:05.253
- Yeah, okay sure.

25:09.480 --> 25:10.263
- Yeah.

25:10.313 --> 25:11.320
- My grandma's recipe.

25:12.480 --> 25:13.313
- Thanks.

25:17.150 --> 25:17.983
- Thank you.

25:27.870 --> 25:30.023
- [Melissa] Pretty nice
night in the city, huh?

25:31.660 --> 25:34.660
How is it possible for me to
lose the host at his own party?

25:36.870 --> 25:38.257
- Well you found me now.

25:57.328 --> 25:58.960
- Guess that means I should go in.

25:59.010 --> 25:59.843
- No.

26:03.090 --> 26:04.563
Let's, let's take a picture.

26:06.241 --> 26:07.074
- Okay.

26:09.420 --> 26:10.253
- Okay.

26:16.405 --> 26:20.518
- Oh God, you made us look like a couple.

26:20.568 --> 26:22.523
- That's a really good
picture of you, yeah.

26:24.122 --> 26:25.122
- Thank you.

26:28.859 --> 26:29.692
- No.

26:35.491 --> 26:37.574
- [Charlie] Wish me luck.

27:00.987 --> 27:03.487
(phone rings)

27:10.060 --> 27:10.893
- Her again?

27:12.490 --> 27:14.533
- Yeah, can't seem to take a hint.

27:15.420 --> 27:17.297
- I know what you mean.

27:17.347 --> 27:18.760
- In what way?

27:18.810 --> 27:21.433
- Like, some people
just got to get a clue.

27:22.750 --> 27:23.720
- Yeah?

27:23.770 --> 27:26.740
- Yeah, like I keep getting
hit up over and over again

27:26.790 --> 27:28.123
by the same jealous guy.

27:30.230 --> 27:32.303
- Does he need to learn
his place in your life?

27:33.540 --> 27:35.290
- Yeah, I guess you could say that.

27:39.080 --> 27:39.913
Is something up?

27:53.754 --> 27:55.270
- Hey Charlie.

27:55.320 --> 27:56.643
My life is a shit show.

27:58.208 --> 28:00.933
- Hey, hey, don't talk like that, okay?

28:02.530 --> 28:04.480
- You would never give up on me, right?

28:05.662 --> 28:06.995
- Of course not.

28:16.490 --> 28:18.993
- Oh uh, hey.

28:20.390 --> 28:21.590
Mind if we talk?

28:21.640 --> 28:23.762
- Laura, I've been wanting
to say this all night.

28:23.812 --> 28:25.112
I think you are so pretty.

28:26.040 --> 28:27.490
- Get away from my boyfriend.

28:30.109 --> 28:32.359
Charlie, let's go upstairs.

28:34.570 --> 28:35.403
- Charlie.

28:40.804 --> 28:43.387
(subtle music)

28:50.541 --> 28:53.791
(muffled conversation)

29:43.770 --> 29:45.543
- Hey, little buddy.

29:47.176 --> 29:48.613
Your little girlfriend left.

29:48.663 --> 29:49.980
- Stop calling me little buddy.

29:50.030 --> 29:51.970
- [Caroline] Okay why?

29:52.020 --> 29:53.020
- Because I hate it.

29:54.290 --> 29:55.627
I've always hated it.

29:55.677 --> 29:58.108
I just don't want to be talked down to

29:58.158 --> 30:00.353
like I'm a fucking
preschooler anymore, okay?

30:02.410 --> 30:03.860
- I'll just call you Charlie.

30:04.866 --> 30:05.866
- All right.

30:09.160 --> 30:09.993
Caroline.

30:18.900 --> 30:19.733
- Caroline?

30:21.390 --> 30:22.850
Okay, that's enough isn't it?

30:22.900 --> 30:25.270
- What I saw you with that other girl.

30:25.320 --> 30:27.370
Let me have my fun.

30:27.420 --> 30:29.810
Aren't those the terms of
our not a relationship?

30:29.860 --> 30:30.800
- Okay, don't harass the kid

30:30.850 --> 30:31.780
just cause you're angry at me.

30:31.830 --> 30:33.422
Leave him out of this.

30:33.472 --> 30:34.353
- I don't need you to defend me, Steven.

30:36.940 --> 30:40.198
I'm done being a part
of this fucked up game.

30:40.248 --> 30:41.197
- Charlie.

30:41.247 --> 30:42.997
- [Charlie] Fuck you.

30:56.118 --> 30:57.230
- Proud of yourself?

30:57.280 --> 30:58.680
- Are you proud of yourself?

31:00.890 --> 31:02.204
- Honestly?

31:02.254 --> 31:03.087
No.

31:04.218 --> 31:07.100
- Good, I'm glad you've
got some sort of a clue.

31:07.150 --> 31:09.370
- Look, come on, I'm
trying to be mature here.

31:09.420 --> 31:11.571
- No, it's way past that.

31:11.621 --> 31:13.643
- Listen to me for one second, please.

31:15.560 --> 31:16.963
I'm trying to say I'm sorry.

31:18.130 --> 31:19.370
Okay, I know that I really,

31:19.420 --> 31:21.813
- [Caroline] Okay, thank you,
thank you for the apology.

31:22.800 --> 31:24.343
It's a Christmas miracle.

31:25.610 --> 31:27.500
You've grown a heart.

31:27.550 --> 31:28.383
- Caroline.

31:31.980 --> 31:32.843
Caroline.

31:33.770 --> 31:38.770
- No!

31:49.340 --> 31:51.923
(subtle music)

31:56.248 --> 31:57.317
- [Bud] Anyway, did I hear you say

31:57.367 --> 32:00.413
you did some modeling work
or, or did I assume that?

32:01.400 --> 32:03.210
'Cause I swear I seen you on,
- [Steven] Party's over.

32:03.260 --> 32:04.600
Get out.

32:04.650 --> 32:05.860
- I'm a little busy here, man.

32:05.910 --> 32:06.693
Thank you.

32:06.743 --> 32:08.390
But like I was saying.

32:08.440 --> 32:09.313
- I said get out.

32:12.250 --> 32:13.083
- Whatever man.

32:13.930 --> 32:15.950
Great party, by the way,

32:16.000 --> 32:17.440
I had a wonderful time

32:17.490 --> 32:20.053
stepping on broken beer bottles and shit.

32:27.880 --> 32:31.023
- Hey, do you want me to stick around?

32:33.720 --> 32:34.553
- Sorry.

32:35.950 --> 32:36.783
Party's over.

32:44.627 --> 32:45.627
- All right.

32:55.260 --> 32:56.093
- Fuck.

32:59.310 --> 33:01.360
- [Ed] I understand, it's a lot of money.

33:04.700 --> 33:05.730
Listen, listen, mom.

33:05.780 --> 33:08.020
I know why you want me to do this, okay?

33:08.070 --> 33:09.657
I know it'd be easier on you.

33:15.690 --> 33:16.523
I know,

33:20.530 --> 33:22.290
if I had to move back to South Africa,

33:22.340 --> 33:24.140
it wouldn't be the end of the world.

33:25.430 --> 33:26.373
It's just,

33:29.940 --> 33:32.450
sorry mom, my phone is about to die

33:32.500 --> 33:36.383
so if anything pops up
I'll just text you, okay?

33:39.200 --> 33:41.123
Yeah, no, no I'm packed.

33:44.140 --> 33:45.080
Love you too, bye.

33:50.360 --> 33:52.580
- [Charlie] You missed the deadline?

33:52.630 --> 33:55.093
So that's it, no visa?

33:56.570 --> 33:58.443
- That's how it looks.

34:00.234 --> 34:02.022
- [Charlie] Ed, I'm so sorry.

34:02.072 --> 34:02.905
That sucks.

34:06.128 --> 34:08.970
- I mean, I'll just have to
go back home come graduation

34:09.020 --> 34:11.613
and you know, I'll figure it all out.

34:15.822 --> 34:17.822
- I'm going to miss you.

34:19.040 --> 34:20.690
I'm gonna miss you a lot and Jun.

34:24.930 --> 34:26.780
- [Caroline] So how smashed
are we getting tonight?

34:26.830 --> 34:28.960
- Well, Ed has an early flight tomorrow,

34:29.010 --> 34:30.830
so we'll probably keep it pretty light.

34:30.880 --> 34:33.500
- But doesn't he normally stick
around for Christmas time?

34:33.550 --> 34:34.870
- No, I wish.

34:34.920 --> 34:37.130
He stayed last Christmas so
he could meet my parents,

34:37.180 --> 34:40.400
but this year he's going to
South Africa for Christmas.

34:40.450 --> 34:42.140
- Well, that just means
he'll miss you more.

34:42.190 --> 34:43.023
- Shit.

34:47.940 --> 34:48.723
- Hey.

34:48.773 --> 34:49.606
Hey Faye.

34:51.320 --> 34:52.620
- You two going out?

34:52.670 --> 34:53.940
- Yeah.

34:53.990 --> 34:55.110
- I won't be home tonight.

34:55.160 --> 34:56.160
- I'll be home late.

34:58.540 --> 35:03.393
- Have fun or whatever.

35:15.570 --> 35:17.160
- [Jun] So she's doing
this whole show on like

35:17.210 --> 35:19.150
the Asian American identity and like

35:19.200 --> 35:22.280
being torn between two
cultures and I'm like,

35:22.330 --> 35:24.510
this bitch doesn't even speak Korean.

35:24.560 --> 35:25.760
She's third generation.

35:25.810 --> 35:27.516
She's not torn between shit.

35:27.566 --> 35:28.610
- Yeah, which I mean, she is Asian though.

35:28.660 --> 35:29.720
Doesn't that mean anything?

35:29.770 --> 35:32.870
And it's not like your Korean's great.

35:32.920 --> 35:35.310
- I spoke it well enough when
I actually went to Korea,

35:35.360 --> 35:36.793
unlike a certain someone.

35:37.677 --> 35:38.625
- So what?

35:38.675 --> 35:39.624
You're just jealous.

35:39.674 --> 35:42.350
- Yes, but that doesn't mean
I'm not better than her.

35:42.400 --> 35:43.250
Wait, hold still.

35:44.340 --> 35:45.560
- Oh no, no, no, don't.

35:45.610 --> 35:46.453
- Hold still.

35:53.798 --> 35:54.930
- You're such a hipster.

35:54.980 --> 35:56.590
- It's not hipster to have fun.

35:56.640 --> 35:57.473
- Uh huh.

35:59.200 --> 36:00.670
- You know, Rain really
liked this one photo

36:00.720 --> 36:02.530
I took of her the other day.

36:02.580 --> 36:03.363
- Oh, did she?

36:03.413 --> 36:05.170
- Yeah, she's going to
use it as the cover photo

36:05.220 --> 36:07.403
for her shitty low FI band's new album.

36:08.318 --> 36:09.773
- Ah, smile.

36:10.840 --> 36:11.680
- Who's the hipster now?

36:11.730 --> 36:13.376
- Okay, no, no.

36:13.426 --> 36:15.420
Come on, you took a photograph
of me so I get one of you.

36:15.470 --> 36:17.227
- Fine, don't make me look bad.

36:24.540 --> 36:26.240
Take it from a little higher.

36:39.509 --> 36:40.292
- I'm sure you'll look great,

36:40.342 --> 36:42.633
despite my clear lack
of photographic talent.

36:49.610 --> 36:50.763
Hey uh,

36:57.880 --> 37:02.473
so listen, uh I need
to tell you something.

37:05.720 --> 37:08.309
I recently I just found out that.

37:08.359 --> 37:11.387
(knocking)

37:11.437 --> 37:13.660
I actually, you know what?

37:13.710 --> 37:14.983
Let me get that.

37:22.660 --> 37:24.573
- Hey.
- Hey, how are you doing?

37:24.623 --> 37:26.620
We're with Manny.

37:26.670 --> 37:27.883
Somebody give me a shot.

37:30.240 --> 37:34.323
- Yeah Manny went to
uh, drinks are on this.

37:42.110 --> 37:43.713
Sorry Charlie, no Laura yet.

37:46.682 --> 37:47.465
- Sorry.

37:47.515 --> 37:49.030
- Where's Steven?

37:49.080 --> 37:50.368
- [Ed] Uh, the roof.

37:50.418 --> 37:51.940
- Scoot together you too.

37:51.990 --> 37:52.960
- What?

37:53.010 --> 37:55.399
- Come on, get together.

37:55.449 --> 37:56.282
- Cheers.

37:57.856 --> 37:59.553
Let's go upstairs.

38:01.201 --> 38:02.701
- Sure, all right.

38:09.441 --> 38:10.388
- Laura, hey.

38:10.438 --> 38:11.780
- Hey Jun.

38:11.830 --> 38:12.730
- Charlie, Laura's here.

38:12.780 --> 38:13.630
- I can see that.

38:14.610 --> 38:15.987
Hey.

38:16.037 --> 38:16.820
- Thanks for the invite.

38:16.870 --> 38:18.121
- Thanks for coming.

38:18.171 --> 38:20.250
Do you maybe want to go
somewhere more private?

38:20.300 --> 38:21.940
I have something I need
to talk to you about.

38:21.990 --> 38:23.551
- [Charlie] Yeah sure, sure, follow me.

38:23.601 --> 38:27.093
- Aw, isn't that adorable?

38:31.530 --> 38:35.042
So what were you going to tell me?

38:35.092 --> 38:35.875
- Sorry what?

38:35.925 --> 38:37.587
- You said you found something out?

38:38.574 --> 38:39.550
- Oh, I can't remember.

38:39.600 --> 38:42.873
It must not have been anything important.

38:45.750 --> 38:47.630
- [Laura] This is so pretty Ed.

38:47.680 --> 38:49.310
You did a great job decorating this place.

38:49.360 --> 38:50.640
- Thank you.

38:50.690 --> 38:51.473
No, I'm just kidding.

38:51.523 --> 38:52.350
It was all Jun.

38:52.400 --> 38:53.730
- You decorated his place?

38:53.780 --> 38:55.080
- I basically live here.

38:55.130 --> 38:57.810
- All right guys, beer pong is ready.

38:57.860 --> 38:59.790
We are very low on booze though.

38:59.840 --> 39:00.870
- [Jun] Oh, that's all right.

39:00.920 --> 39:01.703
Ed's a lightweight anyway.

39:01.753 --> 39:02.830
- Oh sure, yeah, yeah, yeah.

39:02.880 --> 39:03.910
I'm the one who's the lightweight.

39:03.960 --> 39:06.330
I'm the one who gets
tipsy after a single beer.

39:06.380 --> 39:08.270
- [Jun] I don't get tipsy
after a single beer.

39:08.320 --> 39:09.420
It takes at least two.

39:14.690 --> 39:16.543
Alright, get ready to lose.

39:21.470 --> 39:22.783
- All right, come on.

39:22.833 --> 39:24.087
- All right, let's see it Ed.

39:29.870 --> 39:30.870
There it is!

39:33.562 --> 39:34.512
- Not bad for a lightweight

39:34.562 --> 39:36.732
who's a few drinks down huh?

39:36.782 --> 39:37.782
- Nice work.

39:48.765 --> 39:51.093
Yes, let's get this party going.

39:55.322 --> 39:56.655
- Got your text.

40:04.560 --> 40:06.100
- Oh my God!

40:06.150 --> 40:07.600
What the fuck bitch?

40:07.650 --> 40:09.380
- Jun, are you okay?

40:09.430 --> 40:11.383
You can clean up upstairs in the toilet.

40:11.433 --> 40:13.385
- [Caroline] Hand me the paper towels?

40:13.435 --> 40:16.018
- Yo Melissa, she did it again.

40:21.710 --> 40:23.803
- Looks like shit's going down.

40:34.416 --> 40:37.249
- God this is freaking disgusting.

40:40.670 --> 40:42.430
- Hey, how's it going?

40:42.480 --> 40:43.793
- Fan fucking tastic.

40:45.185 --> 40:46.480
- Yikes.

40:46.530 --> 40:48.930
First the thing with Ed and now this.

40:48.980 --> 40:50.030
- What thing with Ed?

40:51.434 --> 40:53.740
- About not getting the
documents signed or you know?

40:53.790 --> 40:55.143
- Did he not get his visa?

40:56.020 --> 40:57.080
- Uh.

40:57.130 --> 40:58.233
- He didn't tell me.

41:00.797 --> 41:02.960
- [Laura] Hey Jun, you okay?

41:03.010 --> 41:05.153
- Yeah, thank you Laura, you're all good.

41:06.080 --> 41:09.130
- [Charlie] You know, it's
more complicated than it sounds

41:09.180 --> 41:12.183
and maybe you should just go talk to him.

41:13.290 --> 41:14.970
- I'm going to head out.

41:15.020 --> 41:16.360
Can't stay in this.

41:18.101 --> 41:20.380
- Charlie, Charlie, how'd that date go?

41:20.430 --> 41:21.332
- It was good.

41:21.382 --> 41:23.170
Yeah, hi.

41:23.220 --> 41:24.723
Hi yeah, I gotta um.

41:30.020 --> 41:32.010
Hey, hey.

41:32.060 --> 41:33.160
Did Jun already leave?

41:33.210 --> 41:35.140
- Yeah, she bolted out of here.

41:35.190 --> 41:36.790
She wants to change her clothes.

41:37.869 --> 41:39.310
- Oh, I'm sorry.

41:39.360 --> 41:40.793
- Ah shit happens, man.

41:44.830 --> 41:45.983
- No, not the vomit.

41:47.800 --> 41:48.930
Hey, listen.

41:48.980 --> 41:51.933
I may have just told her about the visa.

41:56.684 --> 41:57.794
I'm sorry.

41:57.844 --> 41:58.677
- Oh shit.

42:00.523 --> 42:04.040
- I didn't know that
you hadn't told her yet.

42:04.090 --> 42:04.923
- Was she mad?

42:05.960 --> 42:06.980
- I don't know.

42:07.030 --> 42:10.620
She didn't say anything,
she just stormed out.

42:10.670 --> 42:11.863
- It's, it's okay.

42:17.600 --> 42:19.290
Just, just make sure Manny's friends

42:19.340 --> 42:21.053
don't destroy the place.

42:22.255 --> 42:23.255
- All right.

42:31.898 --> 42:34.148
(knocking)

42:43.014 --> 42:44.057
- Hey.

42:44.107 --> 42:44.940
- Hey.

42:47.055 --> 42:47.955
- You look better.

42:48.820 --> 42:49.903
- Not a high bar.

42:53.170 --> 42:55.150
- Sorry about what happened at the party.

42:55.200 --> 42:58.450
I can't believe Manny would
invite people like that over.

42:58.500 --> 43:03.390
- Typical, people behave
stupidly, it happens.

43:03.440 --> 43:04.273
- Faye home?

43:06.930 --> 43:07.763
- No.

43:12.550 --> 43:14.623
So you're going to
explain yourself or what?

43:17.500 --> 43:18.913
Ed, I know about the visa.

43:23.540 --> 43:26.270
How could you be such a dumb ass?

43:26.320 --> 43:28.003
Are you just a fucking idiot?

43:31.847 --> 43:33.000
- I'm sorry.

43:33.050 --> 43:35.520
I don't want to hear that you're sorry.

43:35.570 --> 43:38.103
I want to hear that
you're going to fix this.

43:39.995 --> 43:41.893
- Okay, think about the position I'm in.

43:44.340 --> 43:45.173
I tried,

43:47.280 --> 43:50.070
I tried bringing up moving
to the states to my mother.

43:50.120 --> 43:51.770
I told her I was thinking about it

43:51.820 --> 43:54.640
and she begged me not
to, almost forbid me.

43:54.690 --> 43:56.150
- You're a grown man.

43:56.200 --> 44:00.690
- Okay I know, but I can't
break my mother's heart, Jun.

44:00.740 --> 44:02.500
My father is not around anymore.

44:02.550 --> 44:04.320
So hearing that her son

44:04.370 --> 44:06.640
is thinking of permanently leaving her,

44:06.690 --> 44:09.360
moving to another
country, 8,000 miles away.

44:09.410 --> 44:11.500
- You have two brothers over there.

44:11.550 --> 44:13.720
- But I'm the responsible one.

44:13.770 --> 44:14.630
I can't trust them two.

44:14.680 --> 44:15.543
- Ed, I love you.

44:24.140 --> 44:25.083
Do you love me?

44:31.738 --> 44:33.360
- Hey, hey, hey.

44:36.480 --> 44:38.560
It's more complicated than that.

44:38.610 --> 44:39.850
It was never going to work.

44:39.900 --> 44:41.100
- Here we go again.

44:41.150 --> 44:42.703
Yeah, I'm so sorry, Jun.

44:43.810 --> 44:46.040
I'm just trying to be honest.
- Okay stop it!

44:46.090 --> 44:48.735
- You know, it's just so impractical.

44:48.785 --> 44:51.359
Just give me some time, Jun.

44:51.409 --> 44:52.761
- Listen, I know you've had a rough night.

44:52.811 --> 44:54.310
- You know, I thought
Caroline was an idiot

44:54.360 --> 44:56.290
for dating a scum bag like Steven

44:56.340 --> 44:58.260
but it turns out I've
been screwing a scum bag

44:58.310 --> 44:59.760
for two and a half years now.

45:08.452 --> 45:09.285
Sorry.

45:12.700 --> 45:13.533
- Yeah.

45:17.180 --> 45:22.180
- What do you, what do you think?

45:24.319 --> 45:27.920
- What do you mean?

45:27.970 --> 45:29.243
- Do we have a future?

45:36.130 --> 45:39.930
- Jun I, I shouldn't live
in a different country

45:39.980 --> 45:40.790
even if I wanted to.

45:40.840 --> 45:43.763
- Just answer the question.

45:51.944 --> 45:52.861
Please, Ed.

46:07.370 --> 46:09.083
If you're going to go back,

46:12.645 --> 46:14.645
then we should break up.

46:20.380 --> 46:21.213
Shouldn't we?

46:33.890 --> 46:34.883
- Yes, yeah.

46:39.192 --> 46:40.025
- Fine.

46:57.200 --> 47:02.200
- Uh, goodbye.

47:06.494 --> 47:09.077
(subtle music)

47:14.950 --> 47:17.117
(sobbing)

47:46.231 --> 47:47.481
- [Charlie] Ed?

47:48.500 --> 47:50.833
Ed, what are you doing here?

47:52.005 --> 47:52.838
- Nothing.

47:55.144 --> 47:56.600
You?

47:56.650 --> 47:58.160
- [Charlie] Well I,

47:58.210 --> 48:00.043
I'm just getting something
for my stomach. Are you okay?

48:05.770 --> 48:08.793
Did things work out with Jun?

48:12.450 --> 48:13.393
- Um,

48:16.170 --> 48:18.913
no actually, Jun,

48:21.590 --> 48:23.333
Jun and I we're basically done.

48:26.983 --> 48:28.880
- [Charlie] Shit.

48:28.930 --> 48:29.760
Did I?

48:29.810 --> 48:31.743
- No, you didn't do anything man.

48:38.550 --> 48:39.650
- [Charlie] I'm sorry.

48:52.052 --> 48:52.885
- Fuck.

48:53.912 --> 48:57.590
- It's all right.

48:57.640 --> 48:58.473
- I guess uh,

48:59.753 --> 49:00.536
I guess single Ed

49:00.586 --> 49:02.670
had to make a glorious
come back one day, right?

49:10.130 --> 49:13.437
Anyway, how's things going
with with you and Laura?

49:19.617 --> 49:20.750
- Laura, hey!

49:20.800 --> 49:22.250
- Jun, I didn't know
you were gonna be here.

49:22.300 --> 49:23.948
- [Ed] Charlie, Laura's here.

49:23.998 --> 49:25.012
- I can see that.

49:25.062 --> 49:26.020
- [Laura] Hey.

49:26.070 --> 49:27.236
- Hey.

49:27.286 --> 49:28.267
- Thanks for the invite.

49:28.317 --> 49:30.422
- Thanks for coming.

49:30.472 --> 49:32.570
- Do you maybe wanna go
somewhere more private?

49:32.620 --> 49:34.740
I have something I need
to talk to you about.

49:34.790 --> 49:37.290
- Sure, yeah, yeah, follow me.

49:38.274 --> 49:40.720
- You know how you were talking
about boundaries earlier?

49:40.770 --> 49:42.983
Wondering if there'd be
problems with us getting closer?

49:43.033 --> 49:43.816
- Right.

49:43.866 --> 49:46.190
- Well, I've been thinking
you were kind of right.

49:49.269 --> 49:51.250
- Okay.

49:51.300 --> 49:52.450
- I broke up with Greg.

49:54.320 --> 49:55.153
- Wait, really?

49:56.560 --> 49:59.873
- I like you Charlie, I like you a lot.

49:59.923 --> 50:01.830
- I like you a lot too, Laura.

50:01.880 --> 50:04.420
- I'm really glad you're
excited about all this.

50:04.470 --> 50:06.090
- Let's go join the party huh?

50:06.140 --> 50:07.290
Celebrate a bit.

50:07.340 --> 50:08.383
- Sure Charlie.

50:09.700 --> 50:12.283
But aren't you forgetting something?

50:14.780 --> 50:15.680
- Forgetting what?

50:21.179 --> 50:23.762
(subtle music)

50:28.043 --> 50:30.557
- [Jun] Let's get this party going!

50:30.607 --> 50:31.440
- Oh yes!

50:33.849 --> 50:35.661
- Like have you ever
been to Paris, actually?

50:35.711 --> 50:37.354
- That's great!

50:37.404 --> 50:42.154
♪ And I know that this might be an issue ♪

50:43.093 --> 50:44.080
- [Jun] Oh my God!

50:44.130 --> 50:47.489
What the fuck, bitch?

50:47.539 --> 50:51.325
What did she even eat that was this color?

50:51.375 --> 50:52.208
Oh my God.

50:54.293 --> 50:57.376
Can we just like dry it a little bit?

50:59.164 --> 51:01.680
- I mean, maybe you got some seltzer.

51:01.730 --> 51:04.053
- Yeah, I think this
shirt is just done for.

51:06.860 --> 51:08.346
You know what?

51:08.396 --> 51:10.540
I'm just, I'm just going
to go home and change, so

51:10.590 --> 51:11.929
- Really?

51:11.979 --> 51:13.922
- Thank you, yeah. Thank
you so much, thank you.

51:13.972 --> 51:14.925
- Yeah, of course.

51:14.975 --> 51:15.975
- I'm sorry.

51:18.800 --> 51:20.530
- [Charlie] Hey, how's it going?

51:20.580 --> 51:22.500
- Fan fucking tastic.

51:22.550 --> 51:23.333
- Yikes,

51:23.383 --> 51:25.340
first the thing with Ed and now this.

51:25.390 --> 51:26.223
What a day huh?

51:27.070 --> 51:28.120
- What thing with Ed?

51:31.290 --> 51:32.353
- Was she mad?

51:35.443 --> 51:37.552
- I don't know, she didn't say anything,

51:37.602 --> 51:38.752
but she stormed out so.

51:42.020 --> 51:42.853
- Shit.

51:44.010 --> 51:45.760
- Are you one of Charlie's friends?

51:47.228 --> 51:48.670
- And who are you?

51:48.720 --> 51:49.720
- I'm Laura.

51:51.898 --> 51:52.731
- Okay.

51:54.191 --> 51:55.024
- What?

51:56.399 --> 52:00.840
- I've just been looking
forward to meeting you.

52:00.890 --> 52:02.528
- [Man] Dude, watch
out what are you doing?

52:02.578 --> 52:04.340
- Whatever.

52:04.390 --> 52:06.240
- [Girl] Dude, I think that was mine.

52:07.164 --> 52:08.310
- [Man] I told you not to put it there.

52:08.360 --> 52:09.410
- I'll see you later.

52:17.036 --> 52:17.950
- And I'm like, where are the candles bro?

52:18.000 --> 52:18.783
I told Manny, I'm like,

52:18.833 --> 52:19.727
"Manny, you can't have a party

52:19.777 --> 52:21.617
and go like haunted with candles."

52:26.869 --> 52:28.483
- Hey.

52:29.553 --> 52:30.600
- Missed me?

52:30.650 --> 52:31.483
- Sure did.

52:33.753 --> 52:36.557
Hey, I really smell like vomit.

52:36.607 --> 52:37.780
Do you mind if I change?

52:37.830 --> 52:38.817
- Yeah, go for it.

52:40.510 --> 52:41.760
- It's just really gross.

52:54.297 --> 52:56.773
Laura, I just, I'm so
sorry about all this.

52:56.823 --> 52:59.200
This is so ridiculous.

52:59.250 --> 53:01.763
You should be having fun,
not cleaning up vomit.

53:03.330 --> 53:06.253
- You don't have to apologize, not to me.

53:07.569 --> 53:09.720
Trust me, compared to most
of the dates I've been on

53:09.770 --> 53:11.223
this is an improvement.

53:12.290 --> 53:14.150
- What do you mean by that?

53:14.200 --> 53:16.650
- It got kinda heated
breaking up with him today.

53:18.057 --> 53:21.493
He told me no one would ever love me.

53:22.470 --> 53:23.963
- Fuck Greg then, I love you.

53:30.230 --> 53:34.133
I mean, I love you as, as a
person and, and who you are.

53:35.185 --> 53:36.953
You know what I mean?

53:38.446 --> 53:39.229
- I thought it was just some random girl

53:39.279 --> 53:41.620
from your Comparative Lit class?

53:41.670 --> 53:42.520
- No, not at all.

53:44.361 --> 53:48.040
Listen Laura, you ever find
yourself with a bad guy?

53:48.090 --> 53:53.090
Well, life is just too short
to spend on that bullshit.

53:57.580 --> 54:01.723
- Charlie, I love you too.

54:11.010 --> 54:16.010
- Sorry dude, but can you come
clean the upstairs bedroom?

54:16.190 --> 54:17.373
Someone spilled a beer.

54:19.210 --> 54:21.190
- Christ, another mess.

54:21.240 --> 54:22.073
- Yeah.

54:24.210 --> 54:25.773
- I'll only be a minute, sorry.

54:34.590 --> 54:35.423
Steven.

54:37.615 --> 54:39.563
Why are you being so awful to Caroline?

54:40.540 --> 54:41.610
- God will you two

54:41.660 --> 54:43.980
just fucking stop talking
about each other, man.

54:44.030 --> 54:45.880
Don't you have your own
girl to screw it up with?

54:45.930 --> 54:49.360
- No, actually Laura and I
are doing just fine., thanks.

54:49.410 --> 54:52.073
- Joy, have fun while it lasts.

54:52.123 --> 54:53.523
- What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

54:55.040 --> 54:57.870
- Dude, she started seeing you

54:57.920 --> 55:00.020
while dating another guy, right?

55:00.070 --> 55:02.500
So she's going to fucking
start screwing the next guy

55:02.550 --> 55:03.757
while seeing you too.

55:03.807 --> 55:05.224
- No way in hell.

55:06.200 --> 55:08.930
Laura and I are doing great.

55:08.980 --> 55:11.110
We even just said, I love you.

55:11.160 --> 55:12.750
- And you call me manipulative huh?

55:12.800 --> 55:14.590
- Go fuck yourself.

55:14.640 --> 55:17.403
Steven, I know Caroline won't.

55:19.750 --> 55:21.929
- Caroline will come around.

55:21.979 --> 55:22.970
I'll be getting with her

55:23.020 --> 55:24.843
before you get with your little freshmen.

55:26.597 --> 55:28.163
- We'll see.

55:31.480 --> 55:32.313
- Hey.

55:33.840 --> 55:34.673
- Hey.

55:36.020 --> 55:39.160
- You know, I really appreciated
what you said back there.

55:39.210 --> 55:43.110
- Before, I must have
sounded like a total moron.

55:43.160 --> 55:44.710
- No you didn't.

55:44.760 --> 55:47.110
I wish more guys could be like that.

55:47.160 --> 55:48.940
Greg lied a lot.

55:48.990 --> 55:49.823
He um.

55:51.444 --> 55:52.900
- He what?

55:52.950 --> 55:53.803
- He cheated.

55:55.080 --> 55:56.517
- [Charlie] Cheated?

55:56.567 --> 55:58.605
I thought you two weren't exclusive.

55:58.655 --> 56:00.130
- Well, it was high school.

56:00.180 --> 56:04.733
He said that they didn't,
you know, but they, they um.

56:06.630 --> 56:07.463
- I'm sorry.

56:08.740 --> 56:12.290
You know, you're really special to me

56:12.340 --> 56:14.160
and Greg, whatever he did.

56:14.210 --> 56:16.540
- I don't wanna talk about Greg.

56:16.590 --> 56:17.423
- But like,

56:18.408 --> 56:23.090
- I just, I just want to be
here with you in this moment

56:23.979 --> 56:27.833
where everything feels safe.

56:29.140 --> 56:29.973
- Yeah?

56:34.050 --> 56:36.550
It sucks that we don't get
to see each over break.

56:38.130 --> 56:39.330
What are we going to do?

56:40.301 --> 56:43.993
Like, I just don't know.

56:44.043 --> 56:46.290
- I wish it didn't have to be like that.

56:46.340 --> 56:47.173
- Me too.

56:51.009 --> 56:52.426
Maybe it doesn't.

57:01.060 --> 57:01.947
I love you.

57:33.716 --> 57:36.216
- I should check on the party.

57:40.982 --> 57:43.227
I don't want to, but I have to.

57:43.277 --> 57:44.110
- Okay.

57:45.303 --> 57:47.886
(subtle music)

58:22.190 --> 58:23.110
- Hey you.

58:23.160 --> 58:23.993
- Hey.

58:25.130 --> 58:27.080
- Tonight's been fun, right?

58:27.130 --> 58:27.963
- Yeah.

58:29.230 --> 58:30.780
- Party's really something huh?

58:31.638 --> 58:33.038
Considering all the mishaps.

58:33.890 --> 58:37.913
- Sure, but I wouldn't
want to be anywhere else.

58:39.800 --> 58:43.143
- And you're happy with
us, with where we're going?

58:44.077 --> 58:44.910
- Of course.

58:46.725 --> 58:48.670
- It's a good thing we did
before winter break then.

58:51.320 --> 58:53.260
- What's with the questionnaire.

58:53.310 --> 58:55.213
- It's uh, nothing.

58:57.946 --> 58:59.029
It's nothing.

58:59.960 --> 59:02.203
- You've got something on your mind?

59:04.050 --> 59:07.083
- I guess it's just, we've
moved forward a lot tonight.

59:08.610 --> 59:09.393
You know?

59:09.443 --> 59:11.490
Like we started as a
little date and now we've

59:13.800 --> 59:15.313
I'm just wondering why a girl like you

59:15.363 --> 59:17.090
would be into a guy like me.

59:17.140 --> 59:18.620
- Should I not be?

59:18.670 --> 59:22.470
- No I, no I just, it's dumb.

59:22.520 --> 59:23.853
It's a dumb thought.

59:24.810 --> 59:26.490
- Well, Charlie

59:28.240 --> 59:32.003
you are smart,

59:33.740 --> 59:34.693
cute,

59:36.920 --> 59:41.920
honest and you know, I think
we have something special.

59:47.200 --> 59:48.350
- We're in love, right?

59:49.740 --> 59:52.550
- Why is a guy like you
into a girl like me?

59:52.600 --> 59:53.433
- Same.

59:55.806 --> 59:57.650
- You know, I promised myself
the next guy I slept with

59:57.700 --> 1:00:00.393
would have to be someone really special.

1:00:04.470 --> 1:00:06.070
I needed you in my life tonight.

1:00:06.931 --> 1:00:07.714
- Yeah.

1:00:07.764 --> 1:00:09.350
Listen, do me a favor.

1:00:09.400 --> 1:00:11.393
Hang out for just a little bit, okay?

1:00:11.443 --> 1:00:13.900
I just need to check on the party.

1:00:13.950 --> 1:00:15.103
I will be right back.

1:00:17.710 --> 1:00:19.320
Okay.

1:00:19.370 --> 1:00:20.203
- Okay.

1:00:42.522 --> 1:00:45.030
- [Charlie] I don't know,
I think I just screwed up.

1:00:45.080 --> 1:00:48.780
We just kind of just had sex.

1:00:48.830 --> 1:00:49.940
- What?

1:00:49.990 --> 1:00:51.613
- Yeah, I don't, I don't know.

1:00:53.490 --> 1:00:55.443
- Well, you're having a
better night than I am.

1:00:58.922 --> 1:01:01.255
I don't wanna talk about it.

1:01:07.500 --> 1:01:10.470
- Well, I guess that means I should go in.

1:01:10.520 --> 1:01:11.353
- No.

1:01:14.292 --> 1:01:16.683
- Let's, let's take a picture.

1:01:18.080 --> 1:01:18.913
- Okay.

1:01:20.989 --> 1:01:21.822
- Okay.

1:01:28.043 --> 1:01:28.876
- Oh God.

1:01:30.042 --> 1:01:32.220
You made us look like a couple.

1:01:32.270 --> 1:01:35.730
- That's a really good
picture of you, yeah.

1:01:35.780 --> 1:01:36.613
- Thank you.

1:01:40.950 --> 1:01:41.783
- No.

1:01:49.100 --> 1:01:50.253
- [Charlie] Wish me luck.

1:01:54.527 --> 1:01:55.310
- Hey.

1:01:55.360 --> 1:01:57.310
Sorry, I'm just texting my cousin.

1:01:57.360 --> 1:01:58.260
- Oh, that's fine.

1:02:00.568 --> 1:02:01.670
You guys close?

1:02:01.720 --> 1:02:02.720
- Yeah, you met her.

1:02:03.640 --> 1:02:05.573
- Oh right.

1:02:07.717 --> 1:02:09.810
What's your family like anyway?

1:02:09.860 --> 1:02:12.600
What do your mom and dad do?
- I don't really know my dad.

1:02:12.650 --> 1:02:14.250
He left when I was pretty young.

1:02:16.190 --> 1:02:18.573
- [Charlie] Christ, that's gotta suck.

1:02:20.200 --> 1:02:22.400
- Were you telling your
friend about me too?

1:02:25.830 --> 1:02:28.653
- She and I were just on
the, actually we were,

1:02:30.700 --> 1:02:34.120
Christ, I should go check on that.

1:02:34.170 --> 1:02:35.143
- Leaving me again.

1:02:36.330 --> 1:02:38.330
- I'm sorry, I have guests.

1:02:38.380 --> 1:02:42.760
Steven's completely plastered,
Ed's gone and that leaves me.

1:02:42.810 --> 1:02:44.023
- Love you, Charlie.

1:02:47.466 --> 1:02:48.466
- I'm sorry.

1:03:19.777 --> 1:03:21.225
- Charlie.

1:03:21.275 --> 1:03:23.910
- Oh, hey.

1:03:23.960 --> 1:03:25.010
- Mind if we talk?

1:03:25.060 --> 1:03:27.130
- [Caroline] Laura, I've
been meaning to say this

1:03:27.180 --> 1:03:29.920
from the beginning, I
think you are so pretty.

1:03:29.970 --> 1:03:31.420
- Get away from my boyfriend.

1:03:32.990 --> 1:03:33.823
Charlie.

1:03:35.440 --> 1:03:36.573
Let's go upstairs.

1:03:37.530 --> 1:03:38.363
- Charlie.

1:03:44.360 --> 1:03:45.860
- Charlie, what are you doing?

1:03:47.131 --> 1:03:48.250
- I don't know.

1:03:48.300 --> 1:03:50.130
I just, I have to.

1:03:50.180 --> 1:03:52.580
- It's only been one night.

1:03:52.630 --> 1:03:54.913
What does this say about the
rest of our relationship?

1:03:56.870 --> 1:03:58.010
- I don't know.

1:03:58.983 --> 1:04:00.066
I don't know.

1:04:01.370 --> 1:04:02.200
- I'm going to be honest.

1:04:02.250 --> 1:04:04.860
We're not going to see each
other for a whole month.

1:04:04.910 --> 1:04:06.700
You're out in California.

1:04:06.750 --> 1:04:09.243
So what are we going to do about it?

1:04:10.770 --> 1:04:11.820
- I'll figure it out.

1:04:12.761 --> 1:04:16.310
- Well, I guess like I said,
I've always wanted to visit LA.

1:04:16.360 --> 1:04:17.843
- I live in San Francisco.

1:04:18.800 --> 1:04:19.850
You should know that.

1:04:21.461 --> 1:04:23.873
- You know, you're kind of
acting like Greg, Charlie.

1:04:25.113 --> 1:04:27.163
- I never asked you to break up with him.

1:04:33.120 --> 1:04:35.193
- You said you loved me.

1:04:39.860 --> 1:04:42.583
You're not in love with me.

1:04:43.570 --> 1:04:44.540
- [Charlie] Laura.

1:04:44.590 --> 1:04:45.423
- Are you?

1:04:46.750 --> 1:04:48.609
You're just using me.

1:04:48.659 --> 1:04:50.350
- [Charlie] No, that's not true.

1:04:50.400 --> 1:04:53.453
- You know, I assume that
you knew what you were doing.

1:04:54.930 --> 1:04:58.063
You said you loved me.

1:05:02.910 --> 1:05:06.723
- It's late and I am
drunk and you are drunk.

1:05:07.690 --> 1:05:09.960
I'm sorry if I made you feel this way.

1:05:10.010 --> 1:05:12.323
- Why'd you have to fuck me Charlie?

1:05:54.370 --> 1:05:57.170
- [Caroline] Hey, hey buddy
your little girlfriend left.

1:05:58.045 --> 1:05:59.160
- Stop calling me little buddy.

1:05:59.210 --> 1:06:01.130
- [Caroline] Okay, why?

1:06:01.180 --> 1:06:02.180
- Because I hate it.

1:06:03.440 --> 1:06:04.949
I've always hated.

1:06:04.999 --> 1:06:07.554
I just don't want to be talked down to

1:06:07.604 --> 1:06:09.493
like I'm a fucking
preschool anymore, okay?

1:06:11.650 --> 1:06:13.320
- I'll just call you Charlie.

1:06:20.941 --> 1:06:21.858
- Caroline.

1:06:37.710 --> 1:06:38.710
- [Steven] Caroline?

1:06:40.190 --> 1:06:41.670
Okay, that's enough isn't it?

1:06:41.720 --> 1:06:44.070
- What I saw you with that other girl.

1:06:44.120 --> 1:06:46.170
Let me have my fun.

1:06:46.220 --> 1:06:49.550
Aren't those the terms of
our not a relationship.

1:06:49.600 --> 1:06:51.296
- [Steven] Okay, don't harass the kid

1:06:51.346 --> 1:06:53.078
just cause you're mad at
me. Leave him out of this.

1:06:53.128 --> 1:06:54.213
- I don't need you to defend me, Steven.

1:06:57.460 --> 1:07:00.360
I'm not going to be a part of
this fucked up game anymore.

1:07:00.410 --> 1:07:01.651
- [Caroline] Charlie.

1:07:01.701 --> 1:07:02.618
- Fuck you.

1:07:11.120 --> 1:07:13.003
- [Ed] How are things with you and Laura?

1:07:17.120 --> 1:07:22.120
- She uh, it's a whole thing now.

1:07:25.090 --> 1:07:27.320
- Something wrong with the two of you?

1:07:27.370 --> 1:07:28.203
- Yeah.

1:07:29.080 --> 1:07:31.473
Got into a fight, very big one.

1:07:37.530 --> 1:07:38.480
- That's rough man.

1:07:39.530 --> 1:07:40.363
Sorry.

1:07:42.580 --> 1:07:43.737
- 'Cause guess what?

1:07:43.787 --> 1:07:46.637
Got in a huge fight with
Caroline and Steven right after.

1:07:49.710 --> 1:07:51.363
So it's been a great night.

1:07:56.915 --> 1:07:57.748
- You uh, you and Laura then is it over?

1:08:05.094 --> 1:08:05.927
- I don't know.

1:08:07.330 --> 1:08:09.080
I wish I could go talk to her, but.

1:08:14.450 --> 1:08:15.500
- Well why don't you?

1:08:17.690 --> 1:08:19.281
- Why don't you talk to Jun?

1:08:19.331 --> 1:08:20.660
You've been together for
two and a half years.

1:08:20.710 --> 1:08:22.660
- Okay, now listen to
me. That is different.

1:08:22.710 --> 1:08:23.679
- How?

1:08:23.729 --> 1:08:24.680
You're supposed to get married.

1:08:24.730 --> 1:08:25.520
- Okay, listen.

1:08:25.570 --> 1:08:28.183
All right, I don't see trying
to fix things with Laura.

1:08:30.070 --> 1:08:31.393
Hey, you can do it.

1:08:40.940 --> 1:08:41.892
(subtle music)

1:08:41.942 --> 1:08:43.859
- I have to go see her.

1:08:44.770 --> 1:08:46.263
- Good luck man, okay?

1:09:13.358 --> 1:09:16.025
(phone buzzing)

1:09:29.040 --> 1:09:31.603
- Charlie, what do you want?

1:09:38.570 --> 1:09:41.973
- Hey, thank you for coming down.

1:09:43.420 --> 1:09:44.490
I only have a few hours left

1:09:44.540 --> 1:09:46.379
before I need to go to my flight.

1:09:46.429 --> 1:09:47.900
- So?

1:09:47.950 --> 1:09:49.850
- [Charlie] So, I want to talk to you.

1:09:53.650 --> 1:09:56.170
To be honest, I don't
have anything planned out,

1:09:56.220 --> 1:10:00.300
but I want to know what you
want to do about all of this.

1:10:00.350 --> 1:10:02.970
- I just assumed you came
here to fuck me again.

1:10:03.020 --> 1:10:04.120
- Laura, don't be ridiculous.

1:10:04.170 --> 1:10:06.923
- No, I believed it
when I said I loved you,

1:10:08.190 --> 1:10:12.210
but I'm genuinely not sure
what was worse tonight.

1:10:12.260 --> 1:10:14.330
The time you spent misleading me

1:10:14.380 --> 1:10:16.790
or the time you spent
flirting with Caroline.

1:10:16.840 --> 1:10:18.269
- Laura, I was not flirting with Caroline.

1:10:18.319 --> 1:10:19.102
- Did you even consider my feelings?

1:10:19.152 --> 1:10:20.410
- Yes, I did.

1:10:20.460 --> 1:10:21.738
I never meant to hurt you.

1:10:21.788 --> 1:10:22.838
- Oh, so you love me?

1:10:23.740 --> 1:10:25.723
Do you love me Charlie?

1:10:26.971 --> 1:10:29.080
- Laura, I need to explain this to you

1:10:29.130 --> 1:10:31.503
because I want to be honest.

1:10:32.570 --> 1:10:35.160
I like you and I care about you

1:10:35.210 --> 1:10:36.347
and I care about our relationship

1:10:36.397 --> 1:10:40.210
and I think we have a
great shot together, okay?

1:10:40.260 --> 1:10:43.425
And I was drunk before and I'm sorry.

1:10:43.475 --> 1:10:46.250
- You told me if I ever
found myself with a bad guy,

1:10:46.300 --> 1:10:47.423
I should dump him.

1:10:48.990 --> 1:10:50.090
Do you still believe that?

1:10:50.140 --> 1:10:51.576
- Of course I do.

1:10:51.626 --> 1:10:53.423
- I don't want to see you
when we get back from break.

1:10:57.060 --> 1:10:57.893
- No Laura.

1:10:59.270 --> 1:11:00.103
- Goodbye.

1:11:06.960 --> 1:11:07.793
- Goodbye.

1:11:29.430 --> 1:11:33.299
- Have you been to any
good restaurants lately?

1:11:33.349 --> 1:11:35.490
- Nope, not really.

1:11:35.540 --> 1:11:37.240
- [Jun] Seen any good movies then?

1:11:38.660 --> 1:11:39.980
- No.

1:11:40.030 --> 1:11:42.040
- [Jun] Then I guess there's
nothing else to talk about

1:11:42.090 --> 1:11:44.360
unless you want to talk about Steven.

1:11:44.410 --> 1:11:45.960
- Do you want to talk about Ed?

1:11:47.430 --> 1:11:49.080
- I guess that's good night then.

1:11:50.995 --> 1:11:53.662
(phone buzzing)

1:11:55.181 --> 1:11:57.764
- Are you going to answer that?

1:12:01.572 --> 1:12:03.822
(knocking)

1:12:07.840 --> 1:12:09.170
- Jun, I'm sorry.

1:12:09.220 --> 1:12:10.790
- Ed, it is so fucking late.

1:12:10.840 --> 1:12:12.370
How did you even get in the building?

1:12:12.420 --> 1:12:14.340
- I snuck in behind someone.

1:12:14.390 --> 1:12:15.750
- Oh my God Ed, then sneak back out.

1:12:15.800 --> 1:12:18.540
- I look, I think we can make it work.

1:12:18.590 --> 1:12:20.160
I want to make it work.

1:12:20.210 --> 1:12:22.000
- What about everything you said earlier?

1:12:22.050 --> 1:12:23.840
Different countries, your mother.

1:12:23.890 --> 1:12:25.670
- I realized I don't want
to spend the rest of my life

1:12:25.720 --> 1:12:26.590
in Dublin with my mom.

1:12:26.640 --> 1:12:28.450
I would not have come
here in the first place

1:12:28.500 --> 1:12:29.663
if that were the case.

1:12:32.117 --> 1:12:33.180
- Ed, I just don't think I can believe it.

1:12:33.230 --> 1:12:34.970
- [Faye] You know, some
people are trying to sleep.

1:12:35.020 --> 1:12:36.400
- Faye, can you not?

1:12:36.450 --> 1:12:38.360
- [Faye] Just hurry it up.

1:12:38.410 --> 1:12:39.243
- Charlie?

1:12:40.134 --> 1:12:41.550
Hey Charlie, now's not a good time.

1:12:41.600 --> 1:12:43.850
Oh, Charlie, Charlie what?

1:12:43.900 --> 1:12:45.490
- [Charlie] I don't feel very good,

1:12:45.540 --> 1:12:46.323
I think I'm gonna puke.

1:12:46.373 --> 1:12:47.753
Can you come pick me up?

1:12:47.803 --> 1:12:48.586
- Okay Charlie,

1:12:48.636 --> 1:12:51.390
I'm kind of in the middle of
something right now. Get a car.

1:12:51.440 --> 1:12:52.860
- [Charlie] I don't wanna puke in a taxi.

1:12:52.910 --> 1:12:54.335
- [Caroline] Here, let me talk to him.

1:12:54.385 --> 1:12:56.240
- [Ed] Okay, I'm gonna
hand you over to Caroline.

1:12:56.290 --> 1:12:57.133
- [Caroline] Hey.

1:12:58.660 --> 1:13:00.180
- Okay, look I know that I messed up.

1:13:00.230 --> 1:13:01.505
I really know that.

1:13:01.555 --> 1:13:02.730
- Ed, it is time for you to leave.

1:13:02.780 --> 1:13:04.433
Get your phone and get out.

1:13:06.490 --> 1:13:07.720
- Jun please, I'm sorry.

1:13:07.770 --> 1:13:09.663
- Just leave Ed.

1:13:16.297 --> 1:13:17.503
- Can I keep this?

1:13:24.247 --> 1:13:27.803
I realize you're pretty special to me.

1:13:33.300 --> 1:13:35.100
- You really want to make this work?

1:13:37.990 --> 1:13:40.623
How are we ever going to be practical?

1:13:41.620 --> 1:13:43.373
- I'm still figuring that part out.

1:13:44.960 --> 1:13:48.220
- So what's going to be
different this time around?

1:13:48.270 --> 1:13:50.463
- I wanted things to be
different this time around.

1:13:53.310 --> 1:13:54.930
- [Jun] That's your answer?

1:13:54.980 --> 1:13:57.563
Come on, do better.

1:14:00.130 --> 1:14:01.050
- Do better.

1:14:01.100 --> 1:14:01.933
- Yeah.

1:14:04.210 --> 1:14:06.410
- Okay, okay, that's my answer.

1:14:06.460 --> 1:14:07.243
Okay.

1:14:07.293 --> 1:14:08.200
What do you want from me?

1:14:09.330 --> 1:14:14.280
Like I want to be open
to trying new things,

1:14:14.330 --> 1:14:16.423
to being a little bit more impractical.

1:14:17.675 --> 1:14:20.910
Truth is, you opened me up

1:14:20.960 --> 1:14:24.383
and maybe I haven't always
show my appreciation for that.

1:14:25.370 --> 1:14:26.613
So um,

1:14:28.920 --> 1:14:29.753
um,

1:14:31.880 --> 1:14:34.883
I don't, I don't know, I
don't know what to say.

1:14:38.230 --> 1:14:39.113
I'm sorry.

1:14:44.100 --> 1:14:44.933
I love you.

1:14:50.030 --> 1:14:50.863
I'm sorry.

1:14:52.630 --> 1:14:53.463
I love you.

1:14:55.219 --> 1:14:56.802
I fucking love you.

1:15:08.570 --> 1:15:12.927
- You know, I still think
you're a huge dumb ass.

1:15:17.430 --> 1:15:19.343
