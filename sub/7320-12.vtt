WEBVTT

00:12.700 --> 00:15.067
PREVIOUSLY
ON "GREY'S ANATOMY"...
CAN I HAVE THE KEY BACK?

00:15.100 --> 00:16.833
I HEARD WE BROKE UP, SO I WANT
IT BACK. CAN IT HAVE IT, PLEASE?

00:16.867 --> 00:18.733
DID YOU FIND AN APARTMENT YET?

00:18.767 --> 00:20.700
'CAUSE I WAS
THINKING ABOUT GETTING ONE.

00:20.733 --> 00:23.067
CAN YOU MAKE SURE I STAY
ON DR. HAHN'S CARDIO SERVICE?
WHERE YOU GUYS GOING?
YOU GOING TO JOE'S?

00:23.100 --> 00:24.833
(Mark) I'LL COME MEET YOU.
I CAN'T SLEEP.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?

00:24.867 --> 00:28.200
SEVERE ABANDONMENT ISSUES.
PSYCH IS CRAP.

00:28.233 --> 00:30.333
DEREK KISSED ROSE?
YESTERDAY WE WERE
DATING OTHER PEOPLE.

00:30.367 --> 00:32.833
THAT'S NOT THE POINT.
YOU WEREN'T READY.

00:32.867 --> 00:36.233
AND ROSE IS?
YOU WANT TO GO TO DINNER
WITH ME TONIGHT?

00:36.267 --> 00:42.233
***

00:42.267 --> 00:46.400
(Meredith) WE LIKE TO THINK
THAT WE ARE RATIONAL BEINGS...

00:46.433 --> 00:49.067
HUMANE...

00:49.100 --> 00:51.733
CONSCIENTIOUS...

00:51.767 --> 00:53.733
***

00:53.767 --> 00:55.667
CIVILIZED...

00:55.700 --> 00:58.433
***

00:58.467 --> 01:01.233
THOUGHTFUL.

01:03.300 --> 01:06.400
THIS IS YOUR THIRD SESSION,

01:06.433 --> 01:08.667
AND YOU STILL HAVEN'T
SAID ANYTHING YET.

01:08.700 --> 01:12.333
NOW WHILE I LOVE
THE QUIET TIME, I'M...

01:12.367 --> 01:14.633
I READ A STUDY THAT, UH,

01:14.667 --> 01:19.033
SAYS THAT JUST THE ACT OF
GOING TO THERAPY IS BENEFICIAL,

01:19.067 --> 01:20.800
EVEN IF YOU DON'T SAY ANYTHING,

01:20.833 --> 01:23.400
EVEN IF YOU JUST SIT.

01:23.433 --> 01:26.033
SO YOU THOUGHT
YOU'D COME HERE AND JUST SIT?

01:26.067 --> 01:28.767
THAT'S HOW YOU'RE GONNA
SOLVE YOUR PROBLEMS?
I DON'T HAVE PROBLEMS.

01:28.800 --> 01:30.833
WHAT BRINGS YOU HERE?

01:30.867 --> 01:32.833
BUT WHEN THINGS FALL APART...

01:32.867 --> 01:35.033
EVEN JUST A LITTLE...

01:35.067 --> 01:36.367
IT BECOMES CLEAR--

01:36.400 --> 01:38.533
WE'RE NO BETTER THAN ANIMALS.

01:38.567 --> 01:40.467
***

01:40.500 --> 01:42.467
AAH!

01:42.500 --> 01:44.200
(grunting)

01:44.233 --> 01:47.267
DAMN IT! (grunts)

01:47.300 --> 01:49.367
IT'S NOT THAT BAD.

01:49.400 --> 01:52.300
I MEAN, ONCE WE GET RID OF
THE ROACHES, THE APARTMENT--

01:52.333 --> 01:54.200
THE CRAPARTMENT.

01:54.233 --> 01:57.633
GEORGE, THIS IS OUR HOME.
WE'LL FIX IT UP.

01:57.667 --> 01:59.733
WITH WHAT MONEY?
WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

01:59.767 --> 02:03.300
LOOK, I LIKE IT HERE, AND I
WOULD LIKE IT HERE SO MUCH MORE

02:03.333 --> 02:06.300
IF YOU WOULD
LIKE IT HERE, TOO.
(grunts)

02:06.333 --> 02:08.400
WE HAVE OPPOSABLE THUMBS...

02:08.433 --> 02:09.800
LOOK, I'M FINE.

02:09.833 --> 02:11.333
IT'S JUST...

02:11.367 --> 02:12.700
I JUST HAVEN'T BEEN SLEEPING.

02:12.733 --> 02:15.600
YOU KNOW, IT'S A--THE...
JUST BEEN FIVE WEEKS,

02:15.633 --> 02:17.233
AND I CAN'T SLEEP.

02:17.267 --> 02:19.400
FIVE WEEKS SINCE WHAT?

02:19.433 --> 02:23.033
***

02:23.067 --> 02:24.833
LOOK...

02:24.867 --> 02:26.733
I WORK IN THIS HOSPITAL.

02:26.767 --> 02:28.567
I TRY NOT TO LISTEN
TO GOSSIP,

02:28.600 --> 02:31.033
BUT THIS IS
A VERY GOSSIPY PLACE.

02:31.067 --> 02:33.400
SO THERE ARE SOME THINGS
THAT I'VE HEARD.

02:33.433 --> 02:35.467
DEREK'S NOT
THE REASON I'M... HERE.

02:35.500 --> 02:37.400
HE'S NOT THE REASON.
THEN WHAT BRINGS YOU HERE?

02:37.433 --> 02:40.100
***

02:40.133 --> 02:42.233
(pager beeps)

02:42.267 --> 02:44.500
YOU KNOW, I GOTTA GO.
I'M IN THIS CONTEST.

02:44.533 --> 02:46.700
DR. GREY, IF YOU J--

02:46.733 --> 02:48.767
WE THINK...

02:48.800 --> 02:51.267
(pager beeps)

02:51.300 --> 02:53.233
WE WALK ERECT...

02:53.267 --> 02:55.533
(pager beeps)
I'M UP!

02:55.567 --> 02:58.100
WE SPEAK...

02:58.133 --> 03:00.767
(pager vibrates)

03:00.800 --> 03:02.700
WE DREAM...

03:02.733 --> 03:04.233
BUT DEEP DOWN,

03:04.267 --> 03:07.133
WE'RE ALL STILL ROOTING AROUND
IN THE PRIMORDIAL OOZE,

03:07.167 --> 03:09.467
BITING, CLAWING,

03:09.500 --> 03:12.600
SCRATCHING OUT AN EXISTENCE
IN THE COLD, DARK WORLD

03:12.633 --> 03:15.400
LIKE THE REST OF THE TREE TOADS
AND SLOTHS.

03:15.433 --> 03:17.500
(thud)
OH!

03:17.533 --> 03:20.300
THERE'S A CONTEST
GOING ON.
SIR?

03:20.333 --> 03:22.500
YOUR RESIDENTS--THEY'VE BEEN
LIVING IN THE HOSPITAL

03:22.533 --> 03:25.667
AROUND-THE-CLOCK
FOR THE LAST 14 DAYS,

03:25.700 --> 03:29.200
ENGAGED IN A SURGICAL CONTEST
WITH A POINT SYSTEM.

03:29.233 --> 03:32.233
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

03:37.500 --> 03:40.667
THEY'RE COMMITTED.
IT'S COMMITMENT.
IT'S A LION FIGHT.

03:40.700 --> 03:42.733
OKAY, I HAVE ONE BABY
TO GET TO DAY CARE.

03:42.767 --> 03:44.600
I HAVE 50 RESIDENTS
ON MY WATCH,

03:44.633 --> 03:46.233
FOUR SURGERIES
ON MY SCHEDULE.

03:46.267 --> 03:49.467
THE LIONS CAN FIGHT ALL
THEY WANT. I'M NOT A ZOOKEEPER.

03:50.767 --> 03:54.200
KEEP YOUR ANIMALS
UNDER CONTROL.

03:54.233 --> 03:56.300
YES, SIR.

03:59.700 --> 04:01.767
MOVE IT!

04:05.767 --> 04:08.667
SHE'S WRETCHED...
AND MEAN.

04:08.700 --> 04:11.267
SHE'S NOT.
YOU KNOW, I HEARD
ONE OF THE NURSES SAYING

04:11.300 --> 04:13.467
THAT THEY'VE ONLY BEEN
ON FIVE DATES.
YEAH, 'CAUSE DEREK KNOWS
SHE'S WRETCHED,

04:13.500 --> 04:15.400
AND SHE'S MEAN.
YEAH.

04:15.433 --> 04:17.200
WHAT DID YOU DO
TO YOUR HAIR?

04:17.233 --> 04:20.067
YOU GUYS, I KNOW YOU'RE
TRYING TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER,

04:20.100 --> 04:21.833
BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU,

04:21.867 --> 04:23.767
THIS PAUSING
TO TALK ABOUT ROSE AND DEREK,

04:23.800 --> 04:25.767
IT JUST MEANS...
YEAH?

04:25.800 --> 04:27.833
I'M GONNA WIN. (laughs)
YOU BITCH! OW! WHAT?!

04:27.867 --> 04:29.767
KEEPING IT CLEAN WAS GETTING
IN THE WAY OF THE CONTEST,

04:29.800 --> 04:31.500
SO I CHOPPED IT OFF
LAST NIGHT.

04:31.533 --> 04:33.433
IT JUST MAKES ME FASTER
AND SLEEKER, LIKE A CHEETAH.

04:33.467 --> 04:35.567
YOU CHOPPED OFF ALL YOUR
HOT HAIR FOR A STUPID CONTEST?

04:35.600 --> 04:38.200
NOT STUPID. ROCK STAR CONTEST.
BEST CONTEST EVER.

04:38.233 --> 04:40.433
YOU SHOULD TRY
LIVING IN THE HOSPITAL

04:40.467 --> 04:42.367
FOR TWO STRAIGHT WEEKS, GEORGE.
IT'S AMAZING.

04:42.400 --> 04:44.300
THIS CONTEST
IS FOR RESIDENTS ONLY.
YES! I KNOW THAT.

04:44.333 --> 04:46.233
DOESN'T MEAN
HE CAN'T STILL LIVE HERE.

04:46.267 --> 04:49.133
I FEEL JUICED AND ALIVE, AND MY
BRAIN IS CLICKING AND RUNNING.

04:49.167 --> 04:51.100
I HAVE NEVER BEEN
MORE ON MY GAME.

04:51.133 --> 04:53.733
I'M KINDA SAD
THE CONTEST ENDS TONIGHT.
I'M NOT. I WANT THAT PRIZE.

04:53.767 --> 04:56.533
WHAT PRIZE?
BAILEY WON'T TELL US.
BUT I WANT IT. I WANT IT BAD.

04:56.567 --> 04:59.600
(singsongy) TOO BAD
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA GET IT.
SO ON MY GAME!

05:02.200 --> 05:04.333
(Rose and Derek
speaking indistinctly)

05:04.367 --> 05:06.267
YEAH.
I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER.

05:06.300 --> 05:09.267
BYE.
GOOD MORNING. THANK YOU.

05:09.300 --> 05:11.200
WHAT DO YOU SEE IN HER?

05:11.233 --> 05:13.367
IS IT THE HOT SEX?
IS SHE AN ANIMAL?

05:13.400 --> 05:15.100
IS SHE A BOBCAT?
MARK.

05:15.133 --> 05:17.833
COME ON. LADY ON THE STREETS,
TRAMP IN THE SHEETS. AM I RIGHT?

05:17.867 --> 05:19.367
OH, YEAH. SHE'S AMAZING.

05:19.400 --> 05:22.300
HOT, SWEATY. VERY DIRTY,
HOT, SWEATY SEX.

05:22.333 --> 05:25.400
YOU HAVEN'T SLEPT WITH HER YET,
HAVE YOU?
SHE'S WAITING
UNTIL WE'RE SERIOUS.

05:25.433 --> 05:27.100
SHE HAS MORALS.
SHE'S A LADY.

05:27.133 --> 05:29.733
BESIDES, YOU KNOW
WHAT'S BETTER THAN SEX?
WHAT?

05:29.767 --> 05:33.167
ANTICIPATION.
ANTICIPATION, MY FRIEND.

05:33.200 --> 05:35.100
WHY DIDN'T ANYBODY WAKE ME?

05:35.133 --> 05:36.467
WHY WOULD WE HELP YOU?

05:36.500 --> 05:38.400
THERE'S SUCH A THING
AS HONOR.

05:38.433 --> 05:40.333
YEAH, IT'S DOG-EAT-DOG,
KAREV. SUCK IT UP.

05:40.367 --> 05:43.533
I'M SO NOT DOING THIS.

05:43.567 --> 05:45.333
I'M SO NOT.
CALLIE. CALLIE.
CALLIE. CALLIE. CALLIE.

05:45.367 --> 05:48.200
OH, HEY.

WITH DR. HAHN?

05:48.233 --> 05:50.533
ERICA? YEAH.
WE WENT OUT LAST NIGHT,

05:50.567 --> 05:53.333
AND THEN IT GOT KINDA LATE
WITH THE DANCING AND THE...

05:53.367 --> 05:56.067
ANYWAY... (laughs)
WE NEVER MADE IT HOME,

05:56.100 --> 05:58.300
SO I HITCHED A RIDE HERE.
YOU'RE HANGING OUT
WITH DR. HAHN?

05:58.333 --> 06:01.033
ERICA. YES.
SO YOU AND HAHN ARE FRIENDS?

06:01.067 --> 06:02.633
ERICA. YEAH.

06:02.667 --> 06:04.267
(laughs)

06:04.300 --> 06:06.200
SEE, THIS IS THE DOWNSIDE
OF THE CONTEST.

06:06.233 --> 06:08.133
I'M STUCK HERE ALL THE TIME,

06:08.167 --> 06:09.700
AND CALLIE'S LIVING
IN MY APARTMENT

06:09.733 --> 06:12.167
AND HANGING OUT WITH HAHN.
(Izzie) I BET THEY'RE JUST
TRYING TO PICK UP GUYS.

06:12.200 --> 06:14.100
I'M SO GLAD I'M PAST THAT.
I DON'T NEED GUYS.

06:14.133 --> 06:16.500
I DON'T NEED SEX 'CAUSE
THIS COMPETITION IS MY ORGASM.

06:16.533 --> 06:19.733
YOU KNOW WHAT? I SHOULD BE
HANGING OUT WITH HAHN.
CRISTINA, WOULD YOU FOCUS?

06:19.767 --> 06:22.800
IT IS SO MUCH MORE FUN
KICKING YOUR ASS WHEN YOU FOCUS.

06:22.833 --> 06:24.500
WHO'S WINNING?

06:24.533 --> 06:25.467
YANG.

06:25.500 --> 06:26.433
SURPRISED?

06:26.467 --> 06:27.633
WHAT? LET ME SEE.

06:27.667 --> 06:29.800
(gasps)
I'M 26 POINTS BEHIND?

06:29.833 --> 06:31.733
THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.
COUNT AGAIN.

06:31.767 --> 06:34.800
WHAT ABOUT ALL THE SURGERIES?
ONLY 3 POINTS FOR WATCHING.
YOU GOTTA DO.

06:34.833 --> 06:37.800
I DO DO. I CAN'T MAKE THEM
LET ME DO PROCEDURES.

06:37.833 --> 06:39.200
YOU GOTTA ASK.

06:39.233 --> 06:41.767
YOU GOTTA TAKE CHARGE
OF YOUR OWN DESTINY,

06:41.800 --> 06:44.067
MAKE IT HAPPEN, LIKE THIS.

06:44.100 --> 06:45.833
WHAT DO YOU GOT?
OTIS SHARON,
61-YEAR-OLD MALE,

06:45.867 --> 06:47.567
FOUND UNCONSCIOUS
ON THE STREET CORNER

06:47.600 --> 06:49.500
WITH A SWOLLEN ANKLE.
NOT IT.

06:49.533 --> 06:51.467
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED.

06:51.500 --> 06:53.267
INITIAL B.P.
WAS 90 OVER PALP.

06:53.300 --> 06:55.200
VITALS STABLE
AFTER A BOLUS OF N.S.

06:55.233 --> 06:58.400
OKAY, HE'S MINE.
ALL OF YOU BACK OFF.
IT'S A SWOLLEN ANKLE, IZ.

06:58.433 --> 07:01.033
YEAH, HE PASSED OUT, HE'S PALE,
ALTERED, HYPOTENSIVE,

07:01.067 --> 07:02.300
AND HE'S GOT A RASH.

07:02.333 --> 07:05.767
YOU SEE A SPRAINED ANKLE. I SEE
A MEDICAL MYSTERY. 80 POINTS.

07:05.800 --> 07:07.700
OH, STEVENS IS THE ONLY ONE
WORKING TODAY?

07:07.733 --> 07:09.567
UH, NO. WE'RE ALL WORKING.
WE GOT PAGED.

07:09.600 --> 07:12.633
FOR THE ANKLE. IT'S GONE.
NOW YOU'RE TROLLING FOR TRAUMAS?
SOMEBODY COULD COME IN
ANY MINUTE

07:12.667 --> 07:15.467
WITH A CRITICAL INJURY.
WE'RE BEING PROACTIVE.
WE'RE HELPING PEOPLE.

07:15.500 --> 07:17.400
YOU'RE TROLLING.

SOME HELP OUT HERE?!
WE GOT HIM.

07:27.600 --> 07:29.467
(woman) HE'S BLEEDING.
STOP THE BLEEDING.

07:29.500 --> 07:31.833
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR HAND?
UH, A BEAR.

07:31.867 --> 07:34.067
A WHAT?
HE'S REALLY HURT.
WE TRIED TO STOP THE BLEEDING.

07:34.100 --> 07:36.700
WE WERE CAMPING
IN THE MOUNTAINS.
YOU DROVE ALL THE WAY HERE?

07:36.733 --> 07:40.167
WE COULDN'T WAIT
FOR AN AMBULANCE. I'M FINE.
NO, YOU'RE NOT.
LET ME SEE YOUR HAND.

07:40.200 --> 07:43.400
SIR, LET'S TRY

07:43.433 --> 07:45.167
STEP DOWN RIGHT HERE.

07:45.200 --> 07:47.100

07:50.367 --> 07:51.300
OH! WHOA!

07:51.333 --> 07:53.467
WHOA! WHOA! WHOA!

07:53.500 --> 07:56.067
I--INTESTINES IN THE HANDS.
INTESTINES IN THE HANDS.

07:56.100 --> 07:59.200
DID YOU JUST SAY--
INTESTINE IN THE HANDS!

08:03.100 --> 08:06.067
HE JUST TOUCHED IT. HE JUST...
JUST PUT HIS HAND OUT.

08:06.100 --> 08:09.167
HE TOUCHED A BEAR?
A CUB, AND THEN THE M--
THE MOTHER CAME.

08:09.200 --> 08:10.133
I BET SHE DID.
WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?

08:10.167 --> 08:12.500
WE GO CAMPING ALL THE TIME.
I DON'T--WHY...

08:12.533 --> 08:14.800
OKAY, TRY TO RELAX,
MR. ROBINSON.

08:14.833 --> 08:16.733
ALL RIGHT, GET ME
A CHEST TUBE TRAY, PLEASE.

08:16.767 --> 08:19.300
DID I HEAR BEAR ATTACK?
COMPLETE EVISCERATION, CHIEF.

08:19.333 --> 08:22.100
GIVE ME 100 OF SUX,
20 OF ETOMIDATE.

08:22.133 --> 08:24.167
GET ME AN INTUBATION TRAY
AND AN O.R. ROOM READY NOW.

08:24.200 --> 08:25.633
ARE YOU GONNA PUT ME UNDER?

08:25.667 --> 08:28.467
SIR, IT'LL BE THE BEST THING
THAT'S HAPPENED TO YOU ALL DAY.

08:28.500 --> 08:30.633
(man) IS MY BROTHER
GONNA BE OKAY?

08:30.667 --> 08:32.600
PLEASE. THIS WHOLE THING'S
MY FAULT.

08:32.633 --> 08:34.767
I GOTTA KNOW IF HE'S OKAY.

08:34.800 --> 08:37.200
THEY'RE TAKING HIM TO SURGERY.
THEY DON'T KNOW MUCH YET.

08:37.233 --> 08:38.433
WE'LL KEEP YOU INFORMED.

08:38.467 --> 08:40.200
OKAY, OKAY.

08:40.233 --> 08:42.133
IMPRESSIVE HAND, PHILLIP.
I CAN SEE RIGHT THROUGH IT.

08:42.167 --> 08:44.400
THE BEAR CUB, SHE JUST
LATCHED ON AND WOULDN'T LET GO.

08:44.433 --> 08:46.800
AND THEN--AND THEN WHEN SCOTT

08:46.833 --> 08:49.067
CAME OVER TO TRY TO HELP,
THE MOTHER, SHE...

08:49.100 --> 08:52.667
OH, GOD. I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE GOT OUT OF THERE ALIVE.
HE HAS TO BE ALL RIGHT.

08:52.700 --> 08:56.300
HE'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.
HE HAS TO BE, RIGHT? RIGHT?

08:56.333 --> 08:58.200
HE HAS TO BE ALL RIGHT.

08:58.233 --> 09:00.133
YOU REALLY DON'T REMEMBER
HOW YOU FELL?

09:00.167 --> 09:02.067
ONE MINUTE I WAS WALKING
DOWN THE STREET,

09:02.100 --> 09:04.133
AND THE NEXT MINUTE, THERE WAS
PARAMEDICS STANDING OVER ME.

09:04.167 --> 09:06.200
HAVE YOU
BEEN FEELING DIZZY LATELY,

09:06.233 --> 09:08.233
LIKE THE ROOM IS SPINNING?
MAYBE A LITTLE.

09:08.267 --> 09:11.233
UH-HUH. ANY MUSCLE ACHES?
FATIGUE? FEVER? HEADACHES?

09:11.267 --> 09:13.167
WELL, NOW THAT
YOU MENTION IT, YES.

09:13.200 --> 09:14.833
ANY RECENT TRAVELS?

09:14.867 --> 09:17.600
WELL, I GO BACK AND FORTH
TO THE EAST COAST FOR MY JOB.

09:17.633 --> 09:19.567
DOES THAT COUNT?
NOTICE ANY TICK
OR MOSQUITO BITES?

09:19.600 --> 09:22.433
I-I LIVE NEAR A LAKE. I GET
MOSQUITO BITES ALL THE TIME.

09:22.467 --> 09:26.100
MM-HMM.
OH, GOD.
DO I HAVE SOMETHING BAD,

09:26.133 --> 09:28.233
LIKE MALARIA
OR WEST NILE VIRUS OR SOMETHING?

09:28.267 --> 09:30.567
OH, NO, NO. THERE'S NO NEED
TO PANIC, MR. SHARON.

09:30.600 --> 09:34.400
WE'RE GONNA TAKE THIS
ONE STEP AT A TIME, OKAY?
OKAY.

09:34.433 --> 09:37.767
(Richard) MAMA BEAR
WASN'T MESSING AROUND.

09:37.800 --> 09:39.600
(Miranda) MAMA BEARS
NEVER MESS AROUND.

09:39.633 --> 09:40.800
I HAVE A ROSS PROCEDURE,

09:40.833 --> 09:43.833
BUT I WANT TO KEEP A CLOSE EYE
ON HIS CHEST TUBE OUTPUTS

09:43.867 --> 09:46.367
AND BLOOD PRESSURE.
WHAT'S THE GAME PLAN?

09:46.400 --> 09:48.367
HE'S A SETUP
FOR OVERWHELMING SEPSIS,

09:48.400 --> 09:50.600
SO WE'RE GONNA DEAL WITH
THE LIFE-THREATENING BLOOD LOSS

09:50.633 --> 09:52.800
AND GET OUT OF THERE.

09:52.833 --> 09:55.733
YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO TOUCH HIM
UNTIL HE'S STABLE.
I'M IN O.R. FOUR.

09:55.767 --> 09:58.333
CAN YOU MAKE SURE
I'M GETTING HOURLY UPDATES?
OH, I'D BE MORE THAN HAPPY

09:58.367 --> 10:01.233
TO APPRISE YOU OF HIS CONDITION,
DR. HAHN.
FINE.

10:01.267 --> 10:02.733
YOU DON'T GET POINTS

10:02.767 --> 10:04.733
FOR SUCKING UP
TO AN ATTENDING, YANG.
OH, SHUT UP.

10:08.633 --> 10:10.433
I HATE THIS CONTEST.

10:10.467 --> 10:13.333
THERE'S A LOT OF STUFF IN HERE.
THERE'S A LOT OF STUFF.

10:13.367 --> 10:16.333
STUPID, STUPID CONTEST--
STUPID, AND IRRESPONSIBLE.

10:16.367 --> 10:18.033
OH! I WANT TO PLAY.

10:18.067 --> 10:20.400
THERE'S GOOD STUFF,
FREE STUFF.

10:20.433 --> 10:22.200
I NEED A BUTTERFLY NEEDLE,
A VACUTAINER,

10:22.233 --> 10:23.833
AND, UH,
MAYBE AN L.P. KIT.

10:23.867 --> 10:25.767
I'M 26 POINTS BEHIND,
SO I NEED IT FAST.

10:25.800 --> 10:28.133
WHY, WHAT DO YOU GOT?
SOMETHING GOOD?
OH. UH, SPRAINED ANKLE.

10:28.167 --> 10:30.500
(laughs) YOU GET 26 POINTS
FOR A SPRAINED ANKLE?

10:30.533 --> 10:33.333
LAST TIME CALLIE TREATED WHAT
WE THOUGHT WAS A SPRAINED ANKLE,

10:33.367 --> 10:35.300
IT TURNED OUT THE PATIENT
WAS MALNOURISHED,

10:35.333 --> 10:37.233
HAD A PERFORATED ULCER
AND DIED ON THE TABLE.

10:37.267 --> 10:39.167
THAT'S THE BEST CASE SCENARIO.
YEAH.

10:39.200 --> 10:41.133
WELL, NOT THE DEATH PART,
GEORGE.

10:41.167 --> 10:43.033
THE MEDICAL MYSTERY PART.

10:43.067 --> 10:44.800
IT'S 80 POINTS FOR SOLVING
A MEDICAL MYSTERY.

10:44.833 --> 10:46.467
IT'S THE HOLY GRAIL
OF THE COMPETITION.

10:46.500 --> 10:49.367
OH, YEAH. SOMETIMES AN ANKLE'S
JUST AN ANKLE, THOUGH.

10:49.400 --> 10:52.067
SYNCOPE,
A VERY STRANGE RASH,

10:52.100 --> 10:54.167
PALE, INSIDIOUS ONSET

10:54.200 --> 10:56.100
IN A GUY WHO TRAVELS A LOT.

10:56.133 --> 10:58.367
THIS IS NOT JUST AN ANKLE.

10:58.400 --> 11:00.567
OH, THANKS.

11:03.400 --> 11:06.067
OH, I COULD DO
A LOT WITH THESE.

11:06.100 --> 11:08.033
THAT'S AN UNDERPAD.

11:08.067 --> 11:10.067
UNDERPADS SOAK UP URINE.

11:10.100 --> 11:13.433
OR... IT COULD BE
A PLACE MAT.

11:16.800 --> 11:18.700
OH!

11:18.733 --> 11:20.567
FRUIT BOWL.

11:20.600 --> 11:23.100
(monitor beeps)

11:23.133 --> 11:24.467
(beep)

11:24.500 --> 11:26.433
THERE. DONE.

11:26.467 --> 11:29.700
BEAT YOU,
BUSTED HAND AND ALL.

11:29.733 --> 11:32.167
IT'S COMPLETELY ILLEGIBLE.
HE'S A SLOB.

11:32.200 --> 11:34.133
STILL BEAT HER.
OKAY, MR. ROBINSON,

11:34.167 --> 11:37.133
DR. O'MALLEY IS GOING TO COME
AND TAKE YOU TO X-RAY,

11:37.167 --> 11:39.600
AND I AM GONNA TAKE YOUR WIFE
TO THE WAITING ROOM

11:39.633 --> 11:40.867
UNTIL YOU GET BACK.

11:40.900 --> 11:43.833
SHE SAID "WIFE."
I'M STILL NOT USED TO THAT.
WE'RE NEWLYWEDS.

11:43.867 --> 11:47.033
CONGRATULATIONS.
SHE'S MY REBOUND GIRL.

11:47.067 --> 11:50.167
UM, HE'S A LITTLE HOPPED UP
ON PAINKILLERS RIGHT NOW.

11:50.200 --> 11:51.400
I THINK YOU'RE OVERSHARING,
HONEY.

11:51.433 --> 11:54.133
SHE THOUGHT
SHE WAS MY REBOUND GIRL,

11:54.167 --> 11:56.267
BUT I REBOUNDED HER,
ALL THE WAY TO THE CHURCH.

11:56.300 --> 11:59.033
ONLY KNEW HER TEN DAYS,
BUT WHEN YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW.

11:59.067 --> 12:01.300
YOU KNOW?

12:01.333 --> 12:03.800
I'M LEAVING YOU.

12:03.833 --> 12:06.033
I'LL MISS YOU
WHILE YOU'RE GONE.

12:07.600 --> 12:09.700
(woman) DR. NORTON,
DR. NORTON...

12:09.733 --> 12:10.800
(sobs)

12:10.833 --> 12:12.500
DR. MANSFIELD...

12:12.533 --> 12:14.300
ARE YOU OKAY?

12:14.333 --> 12:15.800
IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW,

12:15.833 --> 12:18.600
YOU MARRY A MAN LIKE THAT...

12:18.633 --> 12:22.133
OR A MAN LIKE THAT
MARRIES YOU,

12:22.167 --> 12:24.067
AND HE'S CUTE AND HE'S RICH...

12:24.100 --> 12:28.333
HE'S A CATCH
BY ANYONE'S STANDARD.

12:28.367 --> 12:30.267
SO YOU SORT OF SIT AROUND

12:30.300 --> 12:32.667
WAITING FOR
THE OTHER SHOE TO DROP,

12:32.700 --> 12:35.600
BECAUSE THERE'S NO WAY
A MAN LIKE THAT MARRIES YOU.

12:35.633 --> 12:37.467
OR ME.

12:37.500 --> 12:40.267
I MEAN, HE MARRIED ME.

12:40.300 --> 12:43.300
(sobbing)

12:45.500 --> 12:48.167
I'M SORRY. I MUST
LOOK LIKE A CRAZY WOMAN.

12:48.200 --> 12:51.067
IT'S OKAY, BUT IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE BLEEDING A LITTLE.

12:51.100 --> 12:53.800
DO YOU MIND
IF I JUST TAKE A LOOK?
NO, NO. I'M--I'M FINE.

12:53.833 --> 12:57.767
I JUST SCRATCHED MYSELF ON
A BRANCH WHEN WE WERE RUNNING.

12:59.800 --> 13:02.467
WHY ARE YOU
LOOKING AT ME LIKE THAT?

13:04.600 --> 13:06.767
C.T.'s CLEAR.
(Mark) BUT IT'S DEEP.
THAT BEAR CLAWED YOU GOOD.

13:06.800 --> 13:08.400
GOD, I DIDN'T EVEN FEEL IT.

13:08.433 --> 13:12.600
ADRENALINE'S
A PRETTY POWERFUL DRUG.

13:12.633 --> 13:14.533
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO REPAIR
THE GALEA,

13:14.567 --> 13:17.133
BUT IT SHOULD REATTACH
WITHOUT A PROBLEM.

13:17.167 --> 13:19.167
OKAY, SQUEEZE MY FINGERS
AS HARD AS YOU CAN, PLEASE.

13:19.200 --> 13:20.267
GOOD.
I JUST GOT HAPPY.

13:20.300 --> 13:24.133
I JUST GOT MARRIED,
AND I'M REALLY, REALLY HAPPY.

13:24.167 --> 13:27.100
I DON'T HAVE
PERMANENT BRAIN DAMAGE, DO I?
NO, IT APPEARS
THAT YOU DO NOT.

13:27.133 --> 13:28.167
OKAY, GOOD.

13:28.200 --> 13:31.233
ALL RIGHT. PAGE ME
IF ANY NEURO DEFICITS APPEAR.

13:33.733 --> 13:35.267
YOU GOT LUCKY.

13:35.300 --> 13:37.200
YOUR SCALP WASN'T
COMPLETELY TAKEN OFF,

13:37.233 --> 13:40.300
SO WE CAN JUST SEW IT BACK ON.
YOUR HAIR SHOULD COVER THE SCAR.

13:40.333 --> 13:42.233
YOU WON'T EVEN NEED SURGERY.

13:42.267 --> 13:44.367
WOW. THAT'S GREAT.
THANK YOU.

13:44.400 --> 13:46.300
DR. GREY HERE
WILL TAKE CARE OF YOU.

13:46.333 --> 13:49.033
YOU CAN GO BACK
TO BEING A HAPPY NEWLYWED.
OKAY.

13:49.067 --> 13:53.033
(lowered voice) DON'T WORRY.
HE AND ROSE WON'T LAST.

13:56.100 --> 13:57.800
(Richard) HE'S HYPOTHERMIC,
AND HIS BOWELS ARE SWOLLEN.

13:57.833 --> 14:00.267
WE NEED TO STABILIZE HIM IN
THE I.C.U. AND TRY AND GET HIM

14:00.300 --> 14:02.133
BACK TO THE O.R.
WHEN HE'S LESS ACIDOTIC.

14:02.167 --> 14:04.067
THAT'LL GIVE US TIME TO DEAL
WITH THE PUNCTURE WOUNDS

14:04.100 --> 14:05.567
AND THE LACERATIONS.

14:05.600 --> 14:08.400
SORRY TO SAY THAT ONE OF YOU
HAS SEVERAL HUNDRED SUTURES

14:08.433 --> 14:10.400
AHEAD OF YOU.
(Alex) I CAN DO IT.

14:10.433 --> 14:13.167
I'LL DO IT.
I NEED THE PRACTICE.
HER STITCHES ARE FLAWLESS.
I NEED THE WORK.

14:13.200 --> 14:16.300
YES, THEY'RE FLAWLESS
BECAUSE I PRACTICE.
KAREV, IT'S YOURS.

14:16.333 --> 14:17.800
(Alex chuckles) YES.
COME ON.

14:17.833 --> 14:19.400
YOU NEED TO UPDATE HAHN
ON THE CONDITION

14:19.433 --> 14:22.033
OF THE PATIENT HOURLY.
THAT OUGHT TO KEEP YOU BUSY.
THAT IS A MINUTE AN HOUR.

14:22.067 --> 14:24.067
I CAN SUTURE FOR THE OTHER 59.
FINE, YOU BOTH DO IT.

14:24.100 --> 14:26.533
THAT'S NOT FAIR.
THIS MAN WAS A CHEW TOY
FOR A GRIZZLY BEAR.

14:26.567 --> 14:28.133
THERE'LL BE ENOUGH
TO GO AROUND.

14:28.167 --> 14:31.400
A LOT OF ENTHUSIASM
FOR AN AFTERNOON OF STITCHING.

14:31.433 --> 14:34.300
SOME PEOPLE FIND IT BORING.
I VALUE THE FUNDAMENTALS.

14:34.333 --> 14:36.367
IT'S A POINT A SUTURE.
KISS ASS.

14:36.400 --> 14:37.467
(chuckles)

14:51.067 --> 14:53.600
IT IS A HAIRLINE FRACTURE.

14:53.633 --> 14:55.533
HIS E.S.R. AND C.R.P.s
WERE ELEVATED.

14:55.567 --> 14:58.433
I ALSO APPRECIATED
SOME SWELLING IN THE KNEE.

14:58.467 --> 14:59.667
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

14:59.700 --> 15:02.300
THERE COULD BE SOME SORT OF
INFLAMMATORY PROCESS GOING ON.

15:02.333 --> 15:03.800
INFLAMMATORY?
THAT SOUNDS BAD.

15:03.833 --> 15:05.833
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO WORRY YET, MR. SHARON.
YET?

15:05.867 --> 15:08.200
IS THERE SOMEONE
I CAN CALL FOR YOU?

15:08.233 --> 15:10.367
MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T
BE ALONE HERE TODAY.
NO.

15:10.400 --> 15:13.100
UM, HOW WERE HIS LABS?
W.B.C.'s NORMAL,
SLIGHTLY ANEMIC,

15:13.133 --> 15:15.033
POTASSIUM'S MILDLY DECREASED.
OKAY, GIVE HIM,
A, UH, K-RIDER,

15:15.067 --> 15:16.800
THEN SEE IF YOU CAN TAP
THE FLUID IN HIS KNEE

15:16.833 --> 15:18.567
TO CHECK FOR WHITE CELLS
OR CRYSTALS.

15:18.600 --> 15:20.500
LET ME KNOW
IF THE TAP'S POSITIVE.

15:20.533 --> 15:22.600
GOOD LUCK, MR. SHARON.
YOU THINK I NEED LUCK?

15:22.633 --> 15:26.467
OH, GOD. I WANT TO GO HOME.
I WANT TO GO HOME.

15:26.500 --> 15:28.433
MR. SHARON--
I-I WANT--
LOOK, I WANT TO GO BACK.

15:28.467 --> 15:31.300
I WANT TO GO BACK
TO WHEN I WAS 30,

15:31.333 --> 15:33.233
AND I WANT TO STOP SMOKING
WHEN I WAS 30.

15:33.267 --> 15:34.800
OR BACK TO WHEN I WAS 20

15:34.833 --> 15:37.100
AND NOT START SMOKING
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

15:37.133 --> 15:39.267
I WANT TO GIVE UP COFFEE
AND JUNK FOOD AND BEER,

15:39.300 --> 15:41.700
AND I WANT TO BE HEALTHY
LIKE MY EX-WIFE

15:41.733 --> 15:44.067
ALWAYS NAGGED ME TO BE.
SHE WAS A SAINT. (chuckles)

15:44.100 --> 15:45.833
SHE WAS A SAINT,
AND I DROVE HER AWAY.

15:45.867 --> 15:48.467
I WANT TO GO BACK
AND NOT DRIVE HER AWAY

15:48.500 --> 15:50.633
SO I DON'T END UP AT 60,
SICK AND FAT AND ALONE

15:50.667 --> 15:52.300
AND SCARED IN SOME HOSPITAL

15:52.333 --> 15:53.533
WITH SOME
BEAUTIFUL YOUNG DOCTOR

15:53.567 --> 15:55.200
HOLDING MY HAND,

15:55.233 --> 15:57.133
THAT SHE WOULDN'T BE
HOLDING MY HAND

15:57.167 --> 15:58.800
EXCEPT SHE'S
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

15:58.833 --> 16:01.233
WHAT HORRIBLE DISEASE
I'M GONNA DIE OF.

16:01.267 --> 16:03.667
I... I WANT TO GO HOME.

16:03.700 --> 16:06.133
WHOA. WHERE'S THE FIRE?

16:06.167 --> 16:08.567
CAN'T TALK NOW. GOTTA KICK
KAREV'S ASS SUTURING.

16:08.600 --> 16:12.600
UH, SINCE WHEN ARE YOU
FRIENDS WITH MY MENTOR?
"A," SHE'S NOT YOUR MENTOR

16:12.633 --> 16:14.400
BECAUSE SHE TREATS YOU
LIKE CRAP,

16:14.433 --> 16:16.233
AND "B," IF YOU WEREN'T
LIVING IN THE HOSPITAL

16:16.267 --> 16:18.400
LIKE A MANGY DOG,
YOU WOULD'VE NOTICED

16:18.433 --> 16:21.233
THAT ERICA AND I HAVE BEEN
FRIENDS FOR A WHILE.
YOU PUT IN A GOOD WORD
FOR ME, RIGHT?

16:21.267 --> 16:23.267
WE DON'T TALK ABOUT YOU.
I LET YOU LIVE WITH ME.

16:23.300 --> 16:25.033
HE'S GETTING ON THE ELEVATOR.
WHO?

16:25.067 --> 16:26.567
ALEX.
(elevator bell dings)

16:26.600 --> 16:27.767
WHOA! HOLD IT! HOLD IT!

16:27.800 --> 16:30.200
IT NEEDS SURGERY,
BUT CALLIE WANTS TO DO

16:30.233 --> 16:31.733
24 HOURS
OF ANTIBIOTIC COVERAGE.

16:31.767 --> 16:34.367
SO I THINK WE SHOULD JUST
IRRIGATE AND SPLINT.

16:34.400 --> 16:36.300
OKAY.
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

16:36.333 --> 16:38.233
OR I COULD TAKE CARE OF IT,

16:38.267 --> 16:40.233
AND YOU COULD TAKE CARE
OF THE WIFE'S SCALP.

16:40.267 --> 16:42.167
SHE NEEDS
LOTS OF COMPLEX SUTURES.

16:42.200 --> 16:44.100
YOU COULD GET
LOTS OF COMPLEX PRACTICE.

16:44.133 --> 16:46.033
ISN'T THAT
LIKE A POINT A SUTURE?

16:46.067 --> 16:48.667
YOU DON'T WANT THAT?
I THINK THIS IS BIGGER
THAN A BROKEN HAND.

16:48.700 --> 16:50.033
HE PROVOKED A BEAR

16:50.067 --> 16:52.833
AND THEN DROVE HIMSELF
TO THE HOSPITAL.
WELL, HE--HE WAS IN SHOCK.

16:52.867 --> 16:54.833
AND HE MARRIED
HIS REBOUND GIRL.
WHAT?

16:54.867 --> 16:56.700
HE MARRIED HIS REBOUND GIRL,

16:56.733 --> 16:59.033
AFTER KNOWING HER
FOR ONLY TEN DAYS.

16:59.067 --> 17:01.267
NOBODY DOES THAT.
WHO DOES THAT?

17:01.300 --> 17:02.500
I'M THINKING BRAIN TUMOR.

17:02.533 --> 17:04.567
I GOT MARRIED ON THE SPUR
OF THE MOMENT,

17:04.600 --> 17:07.467
AND I DON'T HAVE
A BRAIN TUMOR.
THAT YOU KNOW OF.

17:07.500 --> 17:10.067
I'LL DO THE SCALP.
YOU WILL?

17:10.100 --> 17:11.300
I'M GONNA WATCH YOU

17:11.333 --> 17:13.367
TRY TO TURN A BROKEN HAND
INTO A NEURO PROBLEM

17:13.400 --> 17:15.300
JUST TO GET
SOME EXTRA POINTS? NOPE.

17:15.333 --> 17:17.100
IT'S NOT ABOUT THE POINTS.
I'M GONNA WATCH YOU

17:17.133 --> 17:19.500
TRY TO TURN A BROKEN HAND
INTO A NEURO PROBLEM

17:19.533 --> 17:21.600
JUST SO YOU HAVE A REASON
TO TALK TO SHEPHERD?

17:21.633 --> 17:23.300
(chuckles) NOPE.

17:23.333 --> 17:26.200
I DO NOT NEED A REASON
TO TALK TO SHEPHERD.

17:26.233 --> 17:29.500
IF I WANT TO TALK TO SHEPHERD,
I'LL TALK...

17:41.467 --> 17:43.833
OH.
OH. HEY. OH.
WHAT IS THIS?

17:43.867 --> 17:46.100
IS THIS A HINT? I SHOULD BE
GETTING YOU MORE GIFTS?

17:46.133 --> 17:48.067
A GRATEFUL PATIENT
GAVE THEM TO ME,

17:48.100 --> 17:49.800
BUT SINCE YOU'RE ASKING,

17:49.833 --> 17:52.367
I DO LIKE A NICE BOX
OF CHOCOLATES.
YOU'RE GONNA DIE
OF A DIABETIC COMA,

17:52.400 --> 17:53.833
AND I DON'T WANT
ANY PART OF IT.

17:53.867 --> 17:56.200
CHEAPSKATE.
(whispers) CRACKHEAD.

17:56.233 --> 17:59.467
OHH.

17:59.500 --> 18:01.400
MM.

18:01.433 --> 18:03.133
HAVE YOU SEEN HIM?

18:03.167 --> 18:05.333
I HAVE.
HAVE YOU SEEN HIS EYES?

18:05.367 --> 18:07.167
I... YEAH.
I'M TRYING TO PLAY IT COOL.

18:07.200 --> 18:10.767
I AM PLAYING IT
SO, SO COOL. I LOVE HIM.

18:12.600 --> 18:15.767
OH, MY GOD.
I... DON'T KNOW YOU.

18:15.800 --> 18:18.367
I... DIDN'T SAY THAT.

18:24.500 --> 18:26.567
(chuckles)

18:26.600 --> 18:28.767
WHAT'S WITH THE FLOWERS?

18:28.800 --> 18:31.400
UH, ARE YOU ASKING
AS A RESIDENT OR A SISTER?
SISTER.

18:31.433 --> 18:33.200
I'M STEALING STUFF.

18:33.233 --> 18:35.100
OKAY.

18:35.133 --> 18:38.067
ARE... YOU OKAY?

18:38.100 --> 18:39.600
RESIDENT AGAIN NOW.

18:39.633 --> 18:42.700
STOP STEALING CRAP
FROM THE HOSPITAL.

18:42.733 --> 18:44.233
22.

18:44.267 --> 18:45.800
KEEP A LID ON IT.

18:45.833 --> 18:49.067
I LIKE TO KNOW WHERE I AM.
pH IS UP TO 7.28.

18:49.100 --> 18:50.833
YEAH, NOT GREAT,
BUT IT'S IMPROVING.

18:50.867 --> 18:53.067
PUSH ANOTHER AMP
OF BICARB FOR A BOOST.

18:53.100 --> 18:55.400
KAREV'S ONLY AT 17.
YOU'RE NOT HELPING!

18:55.433 --> 18:57.800
DID YOU JUST YELL
AT THE CHIEF?

18:57.833 --> 19:00.100
UH... S-SORRY, SIR.
OH, I SHOULD END
THIS COMPETITION RIGHT NOW.

19:00.133 --> 19:02.500
(Cristina and Alex) NO!
NO, NO. UH, UH, I-I MEAN,

19:02.533 --> 19:03.567
UH, IT'S--IT'S FINE.

19:03.600 --> 19:05.833
I MEAN, ACTUALLY,
THEY'RE DOING SOME NICE WORK.

19:05.867 --> 19:08.600
23. SHE'S BEATING
THE PANTS OFF OF YOU, KAREV.

19:08.633 --> 19:11.200
DON'T YOU HAVE AN UPDATE
TO DELIVER?

19:11.233 --> 19:14.500
WELL, I THINK HAHN CAN WAIT
A COUPLE OF MINUTES.
YANG.

19:14.533 --> 19:16.233
(Cristina whispers) CRAP.

19:16.267 --> 19:18.833
I THOUGHT YOU TOLD ME TO KEEP
THE ANIMALS UNDER CONTROL.

19:18.867 --> 19:22.367
WELL, FROM TIME TO TIME,
I LIKE TO GO TO THE ZOO.

19:22.400 --> 19:26.500
(monitor beeping)

19:26.533 --> 19:29.833
DR. HAHN, MR. ROBINSON
IS CRITICAL BUT STABLE.

19:29.867 --> 19:32.733
WE HAD TO PUT HIM ON LOW DOSE
LEVOFED FOR HIS B.P.,

19:32.767 --> 19:35.667
AND HE'S PUT OUT 350 cc's
FROM HIS CHEST TUBE.

19:35.700 --> 19:37.433
ALL RIGHT. I'LL LOOK FORWARD

19:37.467 --> 19:39.267
TO ANOTHER SCINTILLATING REPORT
IN AN HOUR.

19:39.300 --> 19:40.567
OF COURSE.

19:43.367 --> 19:46.233
I'M THINKING WE OUGHT TO HAVE
A LITTLE CONTEST OF OUR OWN.

19:46.267 --> 19:48.767
YOU WANT TO LIVE
IN THE HOSPITAL LIKE RODENTS?

19:48.800 --> 19:50.133
DIFFERENT KIND OF CONTEST.

19:50.167 --> 19:52.167
YOU AND ROSE,
YOU'RE NOT EXCLUSIVE, RIGHT?

19:52.200 --> 19:54.100
SO I'M THINKING--
YOU'RE NOT SERIOUS.

19:54.133 --> 19:56.033
ONE WOMAN, 10 POINTS.
2 WOMEN, SAME TIME, 20 POINTS.

19:56.067 --> 19:58.500
YOU GET OUT IN THE MORNING
BEFORE ANYBODY WAKES UP,

19:58.533 --> 20:00.433
5 POINT BONUS.
YOU ARE SERIOUS.

20:00.467 --> 20:02.667
YOU NEED A LITTLE SPICE
IN YOUR LIFE, MAN.

20:02.700 --> 20:05.400
I'M JUST TRYING TO HELP.
I AM TRULY A WORSE HUMAN BEING
FOR KNOWING YOU.

20:05.433 --> 20:07.500
OW. AH! OW!

20:07.533 --> 20:09.200
IT'S OKAY, MR. SHARON.

20:09.233 --> 20:11.367
(strained voice)
OH, IT'S NOT OKAY. IT HURTS.

20:11.400 --> 20:13.067
I'M ALONE.

20:13.100 --> 20:16.600
I'M ALL ALONE, AND IT HURTS,
AND I'M NOT OKAY. I'M DYING.

20:16.633 --> 20:17.733
(sighs)

20:17.767 --> 20:20.767
BY SOME LUCKY STROKE OF FATE,
YOU FRACTURED YOUR ANKLE

20:20.800 --> 20:22.700
AND ENDED UP
AT SEATTLE GRACE HOSPITAL

20:22.733 --> 20:24.400
WITH ME AS A DOCTOR.

20:24.433 --> 20:26.567
AND I AM GONNA FIND OUT
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU,

20:26.600 --> 20:29.267
AND THEN I'M GONNA DO
MY DAMNEDEST TO FIX IT,

20:29.300 --> 20:31.200
AND IF I CAN'T FIX IT,

20:31.233 --> 20:33.133
I'M GONNA ASSEMBLE
A TEAM OF DOCTORS

20:33.167 --> 20:34.333
THAT ARE BETTER THAN ME,

20:34.367 --> 20:36.267
AND THEY'RE GONNA DO
THEIR DAMNEDEST, TOO.

20:36.300 --> 20:38.200
AND THEN YOU KNOW
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN?
WHAT?

20:38.233 --> 20:40.133
YOU'RE GONNA LIVE
A HEALTHIER LIFE,

20:40.167 --> 20:42.067
AND MAYBE EVEN
CALL YOUR EX-WIFE

20:42.100 --> 20:44.567
BECAUSE YOU'RE BEING GIVEN
A SECOND CHANCE AT LIFE

20:44.600 --> 20:47.467
AND THIS TIME--
THIS TIME YOU CAN DO IT RIGHT.

20:47.500 --> 20:49.533
YOU'RE GONNA FEEL
A LITTLE PRESSURE.

20:49.567 --> 20:52.467
OW! OH!

20:52.500 --> 20:55.200
(monitor beeping)

20:55.233 --> 20:57.367
CHIEF, MR. ROBINSON'S BROTHER.

20:57.400 --> 20:59.767
CAN I TALK TO HIM?

20:59.800 --> 21:01.167
JUST FOR A MINUTE.

21:01.200 --> 21:03.500
(beeping continues)

21:03.533 --> 21:05.100
(Phillip) HEY, MAN.

21:05.133 --> 21:06.767
HEY, THAT YOU, PHIL?

21:06.800 --> 21:08.600
HOW YOU FEELING?

21:08.633 --> 21:10.533
I FEEL LIKE A...

21:10.567 --> 21:13.700
LIKE A BEAR ATE MY GUTS OUT
OR SOMETHING.

21:13.733 --> 21:17.467
YOU TOUCHED A CUB, MAN.
WHAT THE HELL?

21:17.500 --> 21:19.067
(Phillip) I WASN'T THINKING.

21:19.100 --> 21:21.367
I... I'M SO SORRY.

21:21.400 --> 21:23.233
SO TOUCHING THE CUB,
YOU KNEW BETTER?

21:23.267 --> 21:25.033
OF COURSE HE KNEW BETTER.

21:25.067 --> 21:26.633
HE'S HAVING
AN EARLY MIDLIFE CRISIS.

21:26.667 --> 21:28.267
HE'S GONNA KILL US ALL.

21:28.300 --> 21:30.633
I'M NOT HAVING
A MIDLIFE CRISIS.
DUDE, DUDE, DUDE,

21:30.667 --> 21:32.167
YOU MARRIED
YOUR MIDLIFE CRISIS.

21:32.200 --> 21:34.367
JUST 'CAUSE YOU GOT EATEN
BY A BEAR,

21:34.400 --> 21:36.633
YOU DON'T GET TO TALK SMACK
ABOUT MY WIFE.

21:36.667 --> 21:40.500
SO WAS THIS SPONTANEOUS WEDDING
OUT OF CHARACTER FOR YOU?
YOU KNOW WHAT?

21:40.533 --> 21:44.067
HE NEEDS A LITTLE REST,
SO LET'S HAVE SOME QUIET.

21:44.100 --> 21:47.233
(monitor beeping)

21:48.800 --> 21:50.567
OH, WHERE WAS I?

21:50.600 --> 21:51.767
59.

21:51.800 --> 21:54.233
(chuckles) YOU ARE TOAST.

21:54.267 --> 21:56.567
(chuckles) TICKTOCK.

21:56.600 --> 21:59.600
(whispers) OH, SHOOT.

21:59.633 --> 22:02.000
YANG, NO RUNNING
IN THE HOSPITAL.

22:13.233 --> 22:16.100
WHY DID WE DO A SPINAL TAP
ON AN ANKLE FRACTURE?

22:16.133 --> 22:17.500
HE'S GETTING A FULL WORKUP.

22:17.533 --> 22:19.433
HOW MANY POINTS?
WHAT?

22:19.467 --> 22:21.767
LOOK ME IN THE EYES
AND TELL ME YOU ARE NOT

22:21.800 --> 22:23.700
PUTTING THIS MAN THROUGH PAINFUL
AND UNNECESSARY PROCEDURES

22:23.733 --> 22:26.367
BECAUSE YOU'RE TRYING
TO WIN A CONTEST.
I'M DOING THIS

22:26.400 --> 22:28.333
BECAUSE MY PATIENT
HAD DYSPNEA ON EXERTION,

22:28.367 --> 22:29.467
HEADACHES, FEVER, MYALGIA,

22:29.500 --> 22:32.333
A CONFLUENT RASH INTERMITTENTLY
OVER HIS ENTIRE BODY.

22:32.367 --> 22:34.833
I'M WORKING HIM UP FOR R.M.S.F.
AND DOING LYME TITERS,

22:34.867 --> 22:36.767
BUT I'M ALSO WORRIED ABOUT
A RARE AUTOIMMUNE

22:36.800 --> 22:37.967
OR RHEUMATOID DISEASE

22:38.000 --> 22:41.033
BECAUSE OF HIS HIGH C.R.P.
AND SED RATES, OR MAYBE LUPUS.

22:41.067 --> 22:43.200
I'M DOING A SPINAL TAP, TOO,
BECAUSE HE WAS ALTERED

22:43.233 --> 22:45.133
AND IS AMNESTIC
ABOUT HIS FALL EARLIER.

22:45.167 --> 22:48.033
I-I DO WANT TO WIN THIS CONTEST,
BUT I ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE

22:48.067 --> 22:49.800
THAT A MAN DOES NOT LEAVE
THIS HOSPITAL

22:49.833 --> 22:51.467
WITH MENINGITIS
OR ENCEPHALITIS

22:51.500 --> 22:53.467
AND DISCOVER WHEN IT'S TOO LATE
THAT ALL WE DID

22:53.500 --> 22:56.433
WAS TREAT HIS ANKLE.

22:56.467 --> 22:58.467
ALL RIGHT, THEN.
CARRY ON.

23:01.367 --> 23:03.667
WHEN YOU HEAR HOOFBEATS,
THINK HORSES NOT ZEBRAS,

23:03.700 --> 23:05.600
RIGHT, DR. BAILEY?

23:05.633 --> 23:07.833
EXACTLY, O'MALLEY.
EXACTLY.

23:07.867 --> 23:10.067
SOMETHING TELLS ME
YOU'RE NOT JUST WORRIED

23:10.100 --> 23:11.700
ABOUT THE DAMAGE TO MY HAND.

23:11.733 --> 23:13.500
PHILLIP, EARLIER TODAY,

23:13.533 --> 23:15.433
YOU WERE SQUINTING
AT YOUR PAPERWORK.

23:15.467 --> 23:18.600
I KEEP TELLING HIM
HE NEEDS GLASSES.
AND YOUR HANDWRITING

23:18.633 --> 23:21.100
WAS VERY TINY
AND WASN'T ALL THAT LEGIBLE.

23:21.133 --> 23:24.233
IS THAT NORMAL FOR YOU?
WELL, UH, NEVER BEEN
A STRAIGHT-A STUDENT,

23:24.267 --> 23:27.267
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN.
IS HE D--
OR ARE WE DONE HERE?

23:27.300 --> 23:29.200
WE COULD BOTH USE SOME REST.

23:29.233 --> 23:31.667
HUMOR ME FOR ONE MORE SECOND.
(groans)

23:31.700 --> 23:33.467
(sighs)

23:33.500 --> 23:34.833
OKAY, LOOK STRAIGHT AHEAD.

23:34.867 --> 23:37.467
TELL ME
WHEN YOU SEE MY FINGERS.

23:44.533 --> 23:46.600
I SEE THEM.
TUMOR!

23:49.133 --> 23:50.500
SORRY.

23:52.700 --> 23:54.333
THIS IS NICE OF YOU,
REALLY.

23:54.367 --> 23:56.433
DREAMING UP SOME BRAIN TUMOR
TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER

23:56.467 --> 23:58.367
ABOUT THE FACT
THAT I MADE A BEAR MAD.

23:58.400 --> 24:01.133
EVER CROSS YOUR MIND
I MAY BE JUST THE TYPE OF GUY

24:01.167 --> 24:03.400
WHO'S DUMB ENOUGH
TO PET A BEAR?
JENNIFER,
IS HE THAT TYPE OF GUY?

24:03.433 --> 24:06.167
WELL, DON'T ASK ME. I'VE ONLY
KNOWN HIM A FEW MONTHS.

24:06.200 --> 24:08.333
PHILLIP, YOU KNEW BETTER.
YOU TOUCHED THE CUB ANYWAY.

24:08.367 --> 24:10.767
THAT, ALONG WITH
YOUR OTHER SYMPTOMS--
WHAT SYMPTOMS?

24:10.800 --> 24:13.167
MY VISION'S GOING BAD.
SO I GET GLASSES, RIGHT?

24:13.200 --> 24:15.100
BUT IT'S NOT JUST YOUR VISION.

24:15.133 --> 24:17.767
BRAIN TUMORS HAVE BEEN KNOWN
TO IMPEDE JUDGMENT,

24:17.800 --> 24:19.667
PROMPT SPONTANEITY,
IMPULSIVITY.

24:22.433 --> 24:25.333
HE MARRIED
A TRASHY WAITRESS, RIGHT?

24:25.367 --> 24:29.233
I MEAN, THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN,
THAT HE MARRIED A GIRL LIKE ME,

24:29.267 --> 24:32.200
THE REBOUND GIRL.

24:32.233 --> 24:35.800
I'M JUST SAYING, I WOULD
LIKE HIM TO HAVE AN M.R.I.,

24:35.833 --> 24:38.100
JUST TO BE SURE.

24:39.700 --> 24:41.700
WELL, THE ANSWER'S NO.

24:41.733 --> 24:43.567
DO THE M.R.I.

24:43.600 --> 24:44.667
HONEY, I DON'T NEED--

24:44.700 --> 24:49.200
PHILLIP, DO THE DAMN M.R.I.,
BECAUSE YOU'RE WRONG.

24:49.233 --> 24:51.400
HE LOVES ME.

24:54.367 --> 24:57.100
HE LOVES ME.

24:58.433 --> 25:00.300
MR. ROBINSON IS DOING BETTER.

25:00.333 --> 25:02.233
WE WERE ABLE TO D.C.
THE LEVOFED,

25:02.267 --> 25:04.433
AND HE'S INTERMITTENTLY
AWAKE AND LUCID.

25:04.467 --> 25:07.333
HIS CHEST TUBE HAS PUT OUT
100 cc's SINCE I LAST SAW YOU,

25:07.367 --> 25:09.533
AND I'LL BE BACK IN AN HOUR
WITH ANOTHER UPDATE.

25:09.567 --> 25:11.800
IS SOMEBODY CHASING YOU
DR. YANG?
EXCUSE ME?

25:11.833 --> 25:14.400
WHAT ARE YOU
RACING AROUND FOR?

25:14.433 --> 25:16.133
UH, UH, NO REASON.
NO REASON?

25:16.167 --> 25:18.067
NOT BECAUSE YOU'RE RUNNING
TOWARDS THE FINISH LINE

25:18.100 --> 25:20.200
OF THIS SURGICAL CONTEST?

25:20.233 --> 25:21.133
OH, THAT.

25:21.167 --> 25:22.833
YES.
ARE YOU WINNING?

25:22.867 --> 25:25.333
YES, ONCE I FINISH MY SUTURES
ON MR. ROBINSON.

25:25.367 --> 25:26.600
OH, THAT'S TOO BAD.

25:26.633 --> 25:30.100
I WAS GONNA LET YOU WATCH ME PUT
MRS. WITKOWSKY'S NEW VALVE IN,

25:30.133 --> 25:31.600
BUT IF A CONTEST

25:31.633 --> 25:35.167
IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN
A CARDIAC SURGERY, SO BE IT.

25:40.667 --> 25:44.167
I'D BE HAPPY TO WATCH,
DR. HAHN.

25:45.567 --> 25:48.233
CRAP. CRAP. CRAP. CRAP!

25:48.267 --> 25:50.100
ANKLE GUY?

25:50.133 --> 25:52.733
HIS C.S.F. IS SPOTLESS,
THE A.B.G. IS NORMAL,

25:52.767 --> 25:55.467
THE ULTRASOUND IS CLEAR--
WHAT AM I MISSING?

25:55.500 --> 25:58.533
WHAT AM I MISSING?

25:58.567 --> 25:59.667
OH.
WHAT?

25:59.700 --> 26:01.467
RIGHT THERE.
WHERE?

26:01.500 --> 26:02.733
SEE?
NO.

26:02.767 --> 26:05.233
WELL, THE FACT THAT YOU'RE DOING
UNNECESSARY MEDICAL PROCEDURES

26:05.267 --> 26:07.167
TO WIN A CONTEST.
NO! OH, MY GOD.

26:07.200 --> 26:09.333
THE FACT THAT YOU AND MEREDITH
ARE BOTH DOING

26:09.367 --> 26:11.667
UNNECESSARY MEDICAL PROCEDURES
TO WIN A CONTEST.
MEREDITH HAS A MEDICAL MYSTERY?

26:11.700 --> 26:14.767
NO, SHE DOESN'T.
SOMETHING IS WRONG.
YOU WANNA KNOW HOW I KNOW THAT?

26:14.800 --> 26:18.500
NO.
GREAT DOCTORS HAVE
THAT EXTRA INSTINCT, GEORGE.

26:18.533 --> 26:21.400
THEY JUST KNOW.
GREAT DOCTORS,
THEY KNOW WHEN TO STOP.

26:21.433 --> 26:23.533
I HAVE TO HAVE
THAT INSTINCT, GEORGE.

26:23.567 --> 26:25.700
'CAUSE MY INSTINCTS LATELY?
VERY BAD. REALLY BAD.

26:25.733 --> 26:27.733
THEY TOLD ME TO GO FOR CARDIO.

26:27.767 --> 26:30.333
THEY TOLD ME TO HAVE SEX
WITH A MARRIED MAN.
OH?

26:30.367 --> 26:32.833
THEY ARE NOT SERVING ME WELL.
I AM IN DANGER

26:32.867 --> 26:34.333
OF GOING EXTINCT HERE
IF THIS KEEPS UP,

26:34.367 --> 26:37.633
AND I AM GONNA WIN THIS CONTEST
IF FOR NO OTHER REASON

26:37.667 --> 26:39.567
THAN I HAVE TO WIN IT!

26:39.600 --> 26:40.767
(pager beeps)

26:40.800 --> 26:42.700
YOU PAGED ME?

26:42.733 --> 26:45.033
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT LIKE
TO SEE THIS.

26:45.067 --> 26:47.500
IS THAT BEAR ATTACK GUY?
THAT'S BEAR ATTACK GUY,

26:47.533 --> 26:48.833
AND THAT'S HIS BIG OL'
BRAIN TUMOR.

26:48.867 --> 26:51.167
AND I'M NOT REQUIRING
AN APOLOGY, GEORGE.

26:51.200 --> 26:53.100
I'M NOT REQUIRING AN APOLOGY
BECAUSE THE FACT THAT

26:53.133 --> 26:55.033
I MAY HAVE POTENTIALLY
SAVED A LIFE TODAY

26:55.067 --> 26:57.767
IS REWARD ENOUGH FOR ME.
YOU'RE CALLING ME IN TO GLOAT.

26:57.800 --> 27:00.033
NO.

27:00.067 --> 27:02.800
I NEED A FAVOR.

27:02.833 --> 27:05.633
***

27:05.667 --> 27:07.033
(Alex) WHAT AM I AT?

27:07.067 --> 27:08.833
(Richard) 87.

27:08.867 --> 27:11.333
YOU'RE AN UNDERDOG,
AREN'T YOU, KAREV?

27:11.367 --> 27:13.033
SIR?

27:13.067 --> 27:14.800
IT'S NOT THAT YOU DON'T
HAVE THE SKILLS.

27:14.833 --> 27:16.467
YOU HAVE THE SKILLS.

27:16.500 --> 27:20.233
BUT YOU'RE SCRAPPY.
YOU'RE A FIGHTER.

27:20.267 --> 27:21.567
I LIKE THAT.

27:21.600 --> 27:23.533
I ALWAYS ROOT
FOR THE UNDERDOG.

27:23.567 --> 27:26.433
I'M A FIGHTER, BUT, UH,
I'M NO UNDERDOG.

27:26.467 --> 27:28.067
LIKE THIS GUY HERE.

27:28.100 --> 27:30.567
HE--HE DIDN'T, UH,
HE DIDN'T PROVOKE THAT BEAR.

27:30.600 --> 27:31.767
HIS BROTHER DID IT.

27:31.800 --> 27:33.700
NOW HE'S HERE,
FIGHTING FOR HIS LIFE,

27:33.733 --> 27:36.267
PAYING FOR
SOMEONE ELSE'S MISTAKES.

27:36.300 --> 27:39.500
IT DOESN'T MAKE HIM
AN UNDERDOG.

27:39.533 --> 27:43.033
IT JUST, WELL, MAKES HIM
HAVE TO WORK HARDER

27:43.067 --> 27:45.200
TO OVERCOME
THE CARDS HE GOT DEALT.

27:45.233 --> 27:48.033
***

27:48.067 --> 27:49.800
(monitor beeping erratically)

27:49.833 --> 27:52.367
OH, HE'S CRASHING.
HIT THAT CODE BUTTON.

27:52.400 --> 27:54.833
WE GOT A CODE BLUE!
CODE BLUE!

27:54.867 --> 27:57.667
***

27:57.700 --> 27:59.067
THIS IS MEREDITH'S PATIENT?

27:59.100 --> 28:00.633
YES.

28:00.667 --> 28:03.467
SHE DIDN'T WANT
TO COME TO ME HERSELF?

28:03.500 --> 28:06.400
HEY, I'M JUST...
HER INTERN.

28:06.433 --> 28:10.500
***

28:10.533 --> 28:12.167
(monitor emitting
continuous tone)

28:12.200 --> 28:14.767
(Alex grunting)

28:14.800 --> 28:16.800
(Phillip) OH, MY GOD.

28:16.833 --> 28:19.033
***

28:19.067 --> 28:21.433
OH, MY GOD.

28:21.467 --> 28:22.633
HONEY, I'M SO SORRY.

28:22.667 --> 28:26.500
(Richard) WE DID
ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING WE COULD.

28:26.533 --> 28:29.400
THE STRESS WAS JUST
TOO MUCH FOR HIS BODY.

28:29.433 --> 28:33.333
(laughing)

28:33.367 --> 28:36.033
***

28:36.067 --> 28:37.367
THERE'S MORE.

28:37.400 --> 28:39.700
(laughing continues)

28:39.733 --> 28:42.267
THE NEUROSURGEON IS GOING TO
COME IN AND TALK TO YOU.

28:42.300 --> 28:44.733
NO. NO. I NEED TO KNOW.

28:44.767 --> 28:47.400
(laughing continues)
PLEASE.

28:47.433 --> 28:50.367
I'M SORRY. I WAS RIGHT
ABOUT THE TUMOR.

28:50.400 --> 28:51.833
(laughing continues)

28:51.867 --> 28:54.400
YOU HAVE SOMETHING CALLED
A MALIGNANT GLIOMA.

28:54.433 --> 28:56.100
(laughing)

28:56.133 --> 28:57.633
THIS KIND OF TUMOR

28:57.667 --> 28:59.300
CAUSES, UH, BEHAVIORAL...

28:59.333 --> 29:00.833
(laughing continues)

29:00.867 --> 29:02.800
IT CAN CAUSE
INAPPROPRIATE AFFECT.

29:02.833 --> 29:04.433
CAN YOU OPERATE?

29:04.467 --> 29:07.033
NO. IT'S TOO INVASIVE.

29:07.067 --> 29:08.800
(panting)
IT'S BEEN GROWING
A LONG TIME.

29:08.833 --> 29:10.700
(exhales)

29:10.733 --> 29:12.367
OH.

29:12.400 --> 29:14.367
I'M SO SORRY.

29:14.400 --> 29:16.033
(Phillip sobs)

29:16.067 --> 29:18.400
I... (clears throat)

29:18.433 --> 29:20.700
OH. (sniffles)

29:20.733 --> 29:24.067
GOOD.

29:24.100 --> 29:26.167
GOOD, I DESERVE THAT.

29:26.200 --> 29:27.667
I KILLED MY BROTHER,

29:27.700 --> 29:30.200
SO I DON'T DESERVE
TO SURVIVE.

29:30.233 --> 29:31.800
(sniffles)

29:31.833 --> 29:35.000
***

29:48.300 --> 29:50.233
UM... DOCTOR?

29:52.367 --> 29:54.300
I'M A SYMPTOM, RIGHT?

29:54.333 --> 29:56.100
I MEAN, I'M...
I'M LIKE THE BEAR CUB.

29:56.133 --> 29:58.033
I'M JUST A SYMPTOM
OF THIS TUMOR.

29:58.067 --> 30:00.300
THAT'S WHAT
WE'RE SAYING HERE, RIGHT?

30:00.333 --> 30:02.267
JUST SO I'M CLEAR.

30:03.533 --> 30:07.067
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW THAT.

30:07.100 --> 30:10.100
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO COULD KNOW THAT FOR SURE.

30:14.867 --> 30:17.233
WHEN YOU SAY "NEGATIVE,"
DO YOU MEAN AS IN BAD

30:17.267 --> 30:18.633
OR AS IN NONEXISTENT?

30:18.667 --> 30:20.567
NOTHING BAD CAME UP.

30:20.600 --> 30:22.500
WELL, WHAT ABOUT
ALL THOSE ALPHABET TESTS

30:22.533 --> 30:24.033
YOU WERE RAILING OFF?

30:24.067 --> 30:26.433
I MEAN, THEY WERE ELEVATED
OR SOMETHING.

30:26.467 --> 30:29.033
YEAH. UM...
THEY WERE NONSPECIFIC.

30:29.067 --> 30:31.100
THEY LIKELY INDICATED
THAT YOU BASICALLY HAVE

30:31.133 --> 30:33.267
A RELATIVELY MINOR FLU.

30:33.300 --> 30:35.433
I HAVE THE FLU?

30:35.467 --> 30:37.033
THIS WHOLE DAY...

30:37.067 --> 30:38.633
EVERYTHING
YOU PUT ME THROUGH...

30:38.667 --> 30:41.533
YOU PUT ME THROUGH ALL THIS
FOR THE FLU?!

30:41.567 --> 30:42.800
I'M SORRY. I AM.

30:42.833 --> 30:45.300
IT JUST--IT SEEMED LIKE
THERE WAS SOMETHING MORE.

30:45.333 --> 30:46.300
IT REALLY SEEMED...

30:46.333 --> 30:49.267
I KNOW IT'S HARD TO SEE
THE SILVER LINING HERE,

30:49.300 --> 30:52.067
BUT THINK OF THE DISCOVERIES
YOU MADE TODAY

30:52.100 --> 30:54.100
ABOUT YOURSELF AND YOUR LIFE
AND--AND YOUR EX-WIFE.

30:54.133 --> 30:56.167
MY EX-WIFE
WAS A CASTRATING BITCH!

30:56.200 --> 30:58.067
SHE WAS A CASTRATING BITCH,

30:58.100 --> 31:00.667
AND I NEVER MISSED HER
FOR ONE DAY SINCE SHE LEFT!

31:00.700 --> 31:01.867
NOT UNTIL TODAY!

31:01.900 --> 31:04.500
AND I MISSED HER TODAY BECAUSE
IF WE WERE STILL TOGETHER,

31:04.533 --> 31:06.567
SHE WOULD'VE SHOT ME DEAD
A LONG TIME AGO, AND I WOULDN'T

31:06.600 --> 31:09.133
HAVE HAD TO GONE THROUGH
THE HELL YOU PUT ME THROUGH!

31:09.167 --> 31:12.033
I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T MEAN TO.
I REALLY--
YOU TREATED ME LIKE A RAT!

31:12.067 --> 31:14.433
LIKE A RAT
IN SOME PERVERTED LAB!

31:14.467 --> 31:18.067
AH! JUST GIVE MY PRESCRIPTION.
I WANT TO GET OUTTA HERE.

31:18.100 --> 31:19.567
THE FLU IS A VIRUS.

31:19.600 --> 31:23.033
IT, UM, DOESN'T RESPOND
TO ANTIBIOTICS.

31:23.067 --> 31:25.700
I SUGGEST PLENTY OF FLUIDS
AND REST.

31:25.733 --> 31:27.700
FLUIDS AND REST?

31:27.733 --> 31:29.600
(laughs) FLUID AND REST?

31:29.633 --> 31:31.700
I'M SORRY.
FLUIDS AND FREAKIN' REST!

31:31.733 --> 31:35.633
I'M SORRY! I'M SORRY!
I'M REALLY, REALLY SORRY.

31:42.200 --> 31:43.267
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

31:43.300 --> 31:46.033
YOU SPENT THE LAST THREE HOURS
WATCHING A SURGERY.

31:46.067 --> 31:48.767
THAT'S 3 POINTS.
I'M TRUSTING YOU GUYS SCREWED UP
ENOUGH THAT IT WON'T MATTER.

31:48.800 --> 31:50.700
I COULD STILL WIN.
I COULD.

31:50.733 --> 31:52.700
I DID GET
A LOT OF POINTS TODAY.
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?

31:52.733 --> 31:55.700
(Alex) WHERE'S THE TRASH TALK,
CHARLES BARKLEY?
SHE KNOWS I'M THE BEST.

31:58.700 --> 32:01.567
(Izzie) WHO WON?
CONGRATULATIONS...

32:01.600 --> 32:04.500
WHO WON?!
DR. GREY.

32:04.533 --> 32:07.233
(Cristina and Izzie) OH!
THE GUY FROM THE BEAR ATTACK
HAD A BRAIN TUMOR,

32:07.267 --> 32:09.233
AND GREY CAUGHT IT. 80 POINTS
FOR SOLVING A MEDICAL MYSTERY.

32:09.267 --> 32:11.400
THAT'S WHAT PUT HER
OVER THE TOP.
I COULD'VE FOUND A TUMOR.

32:11.433 --> 32:14.167
BUT YOU DIDN'T. YOU CHOSE
TO SCRUB IN WITH HAHN

32:14.200 --> 32:16.600
AND WATCH FOR 3 LITTLE POINTS.
NOW CONGRATULATE DR. GREY.

32:16.633 --> 32:18.533
(Izzie and Cristina
mutter indistinctly)

32:18.567 --> 32:20.067
CONGRATULATIONS.

32:20.100 --> 32:22.533
HEY, DON'T YOU WANT
YOUR PRIZE?

32:22.567 --> 32:25.033
OOH. A SHINY PAGER.

32:25.067 --> 32:27.467
A SPARKLE PAGER.
WHAT'S SO GREAT
ABOUT A GLITTER PAGER?

32:27.500 --> 32:29.700
A SPARKLE PAGER.

32:29.733 --> 32:32.133
IT IS SPECIAL.
IT IS SURGERY'S HOLY GRAIL.

32:32.167 --> 32:34.767
IT'S BEEN PASSED DOWN
FROM RESIDENT TO RESIDENT,

32:34.800 --> 32:36.500
AND NOW IT BELONGS TO DR. GREY.

32:36.533 --> 32:39.267
FOR THE NEXT THREE MONTHS,
WHENEVER YOU ALL GET A SURGERY,

32:39.300 --> 32:42.667
YOU HAVE TO PAGE THIS PAGER,
AND IF GREY WANTS YOUR SURGERY,

32:42.700 --> 32:44.667
SHE HAS THE RIGHT
TO TAKE IT FROM YOU.
COME ON.

32:44.700 --> 32:46.800
(gasps)
CRAP.

32:46.833 --> 32:48.467
ENJOY THE POWER, DR. GREY.

32:48.500 --> 32:50.400
NOW MAY I RECOMMEND
YOU ALL GO HOME?

32:50.433 --> 32:53.233
YOU SMELL, YOU GREASY,
YOU NEED TO BATHE,

32:53.267 --> 32:54.300
AND I'M SICK
OF LOOKING AT YOU.

32:54.333 --> 32:57.333
EVEN MY 1 YEAR OLD HERE
IS SICK OF LOOKING AT YOU.

32:57.367 --> 32:59.400
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, BUG?

32:59.433 --> 33:02.200
SICK OF LOOKING AT YOUR LITTLE,
UGLY FACES.

33:02.233 --> 33:04.733
SOMEHOW I THOUGHT
I WOULD ENJOY THIS MORE.

33:04.767 --> 33:07.567
OH, WELL, GIVE IT TO ME.
I'LL ENJOY IT.
DON'T GIVE IT TO HER.
GIVE IT TO ME.

33:07.600 --> 33:09.567
OH, SHUT UP. IT'S HERS.
SHE'S THE WINNER.

33:09.600 --> 33:12.733
SHE'S NOT GONNA GIVE IT TO YOU.
(lowered voice) GIVE IT TO ME.

33:12.767 --> 33:16.233
(Izzie) UGH. UGH.

33:16.267 --> 33:18.567
(Cristina) ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

33:21.067 --> 33:22.167
I DON'T LIKE HER.

33:22.200 --> 33:25.200
I'M SORRY, BUT AS YOUR FRIEND,
IT'S MY JOB TO SAY IT.

33:25.233 --> 33:26.733
I DON'T LIKE ROSE.

33:26.767 --> 33:28.667
WHY?
YOU'RE NOT EVEN
SLEEPING WITH HER.

33:28.700 --> 33:31.267
YOU DON'T LIKE HER BECAUSE
SHE'S NOT SLEEPING WITH ME?

33:31.300 --> 33:33.200
THAT'S A LITTLE WEIRD.
IT'S NOT WEIRD.

33:33.233 --> 33:35.400
IT'S A LITTLE WEIRD.
HEY, IF YOU WERE
SLEEPING WITH ROSE,

33:35.433 --> 33:37.333
I COULD UNDERSTAND WHY YOU'RE
SPENDING TIME WITH HER,

33:37.367 --> 33:38.533
BUT YOU'RE NOT.

33:38.567 --> 33:41.233
AND IT'S--IT'S JUST, UH,
I THOUGHT THAT, UH,

33:41.267 --> 33:42.400
YOU KNOW...

33:42.433 --> 33:45.333
(whispers) I THOUGHT IT WAS
JUST GONNA BE YOU AND ME.

33:45.367 --> 33:47.400
HAVING SEX?
(normal voice) AFTER.

33:47.433 --> 33:49.200
AFTER ADDISON,
AFTER MEREDITH.

33:49.233 --> 33:50.700
I HAVE BEEN PATIENT.
MM.

33:50.733 --> 33:52.767
I HAVE WAITED WHILE YOU
PARTNERED UP WITH THESE CHICKS,

33:52.800 --> 33:54.167
BUT NOW THEY'RE OVER,

33:54.200 --> 33:56.267
AND IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE
JUST US,

33:56.300 --> 33:58.433
YOU AND ME, TWO GUYS
ON THE PROWL, ON THE HUNT.

33:58.467 --> 33:59.667
YOU'RE HAVING TROUBLE
GETTING LAID,

33:59.700 --> 34:01.600
AND YOU NEED MY HELP.
I CAN GET LAID.

34:01.633 --> 34:05.200
MM-HMM.
I CAN GET LAID
WHENEVER I WANT.

34:05.233 --> 34:07.400
I DO GET LAID
WHENEVER I WANT.
UH-HUH.

34:07.433 --> 34:09.333
THAT'S THE POINT.
WOMEN ARE EVERYWHERE.

34:09.367 --> 34:12.833
I ONLY HAVE ONE PERSON
I CAN TALK TO.

34:12.867 --> 34:15.433
THAT'S SWEET.
SHUT UP.

34:15.467 --> 34:18.367
NO, IT'S REALLY WARM
AND FUZZY, VERY SWEET.
SHUT UP.

34:18.400 --> 34:21.200
ARE YOU SERIOUS
ABOUT THIS WOMAN?

34:21.233 --> 34:23.500
(sighs) I DON'T KNOW.

34:23.533 --> 34:26.600
COULD BE.

34:28.367 --> 34:30.267
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL GIVE HER A CHANCE.

34:30.300 --> 34:32.367
(elevator bell dings)
GOOD BOY.

34:32.400 --> 34:35.300
YOU'RE PATHETIC, AND I'M
A LESSER MAN FOR KNOWING YOU.

34:35.333 --> 34:38.133
THAT'S MY LINE.
YOU CAN'T USE MY LINE.

34:42.100 --> 34:45.233
(door opens)

34:48.433 --> 34:50.600
THOUGHT YOU WERE OFF DUTY
AN HOUR AGO.

34:50.633 --> 34:52.667
I'M JUST CATCHING UP
ON SOME PAPERWORK.

34:52.700 --> 34:55.567
YEAH. PILED UP ON YOU DURING
THE CONTEST, I GUESS.

34:55.600 --> 34:58.133
YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT?

34:58.167 --> 35:00.667
I KNOW ABOUT OTIS SHARON

35:00.700 --> 35:04.800
AND THE $120,000 WORTH OF
UNNECESSARY TESTS YOU ORDERED.

35:04.833 --> 35:07.167
YEAH. WELL...

35:07.200 --> 35:08.733
I LOST.

35:08.767 --> 35:12.267
AND I PUT A MAN THROUGH HELL
FOR NO REASON AT ALL.

35:12.300 --> 35:14.600
I WAS A BAD DOCTOR TODAY
WITH BAD INSTINCTS,

35:14.633 --> 35:16.133
AND I DESERVED TO LOSE.

35:16.167 --> 35:18.267
I DON'T KNOW WHY
I EVEN BOTHERED COMPETING

35:18.300 --> 35:20.667
IN THE STUPID CONTEST.
SO I DON'T NEED TO YELL?

35:20.700 --> 35:22.600
YOU SHOULD. YOU CAN.

35:22.633 --> 35:24.533
BUT YOU DON'T NEED TO.

35:24.567 --> 35:26.700
GOOD.

35:28.167 --> 35:29.233
STEVENS.

35:29.267 --> 35:30.700
YES, SIR?

35:30.733 --> 35:32.267
MY YEAR...

35:32.300 --> 35:34.767
I LOST BY 2 POINTS.

35:34.800 --> 35:36.200
YOU--

35:36.233 --> 35:39.333
YOU DIDN'T INVENT THE CONTEST.

35:39.367 --> 35:42.833
THE CONTEST IS A LION FIGHT.

35:42.867 --> 35:45.400
SO CHIN UP,
PUT YOUR SHOULDERS BACK,

35:45.433 --> 35:47.200
WALK PROUD, STRUT A LITTLE.

35:47.233 --> 35:50.100
DON'T LICK YOUR WOUNDS.
CELEBRATE THEM.

35:50.133 --> 35:54.300
THE SCARS YOU BEAR
ARE THE SIGN OF A COMPETITOR.

35:54.333 --> 35:56.433
YOU WERE IN A LION FIGHT,
STEVENS.

35:56.467 --> 35:57.800
JUST BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T WIN

35:57.833 --> 36:00.700
DOESN'T MEAN
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO ROAR.

36:00.733 --> 36:04.533
***

36:05.800 --> 36:07.467
GOOD NIGHT.

36:07.500 --> 36:09.300
GOOD NIGHT, SIR.

36:09.333 --> 36:12.333
***

36:14.433 --> 36:17.467
THERE'S A LITTLE ANIMAL
IN ALL OF US,

36:17.500 --> 36:19.433
AND MAYBE THAT'S SOMETHING
TO CELEBRATE.

36:19.467 --> 36:20.833
***

36:20.867 --> 36:23.733
OUR ANIMAL INSTINCT
IS WHAT MAKES US SEEK COMFORT,

36:23.767 --> 36:26.200
WARMTH, A PACK TO RUN WITH.

36:26.233 --> 36:30.500
HI, UM... H--
HELLO, DR. HAHN.

36:30.533 --> 36:32.567
I HOPE IT'S OKAY
I INVITED SOMEBODY OVER.

36:32.600 --> 36:34.500
OH, NO, IT'S FINE.
IT'S, UH...

36:34.533 --> 36:37.533
IT'S AN HONOR
TO HAVE YOU HERE, DR. HAHN.

36:37.567 --> 36:40.400
OKAY. I HAVE TO TELL YOU...
(laughs)
(laughs)

36:40.433 --> 36:42.800
YOU WON'T BELIEVE IT.
(Callie) YES.

36:42.833 --> 36:44.800
I...
OKAY.

36:44.833 --> 36:47.600
***

36:47.633 --> 36:49.600
WAS JUST GOING IN THERE.

36:49.633 --> 36:52.633
(Callie and Erica
speaking indistinctly)

36:55.500 --> 36:58.400
WE MAY FEEL CAGED...

36:58.433 --> 37:00.300
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

37:00.333 --> 37:02.633
***

37:02.667 --> 37:06.100
WE MAY FEEL TRAPPED...

37:06.133 --> 37:08.433
***

37:08.467 --> 37:13.100
BUT STILL, AS HUMANS,
WE CAN FIND WAYS TO FEEL FREE.

37:13.133 --> 37:14.733
BE-BEFORE YOU SAY ANYTHING,

37:14.767 --> 37:18.100
BEFORE YOU SAY A WORD,
JUST--JUST HEAR ME OUT.

37:18.133 --> 37:19.567
I KNOW IT'S NOT MUCH,

37:19.600 --> 37:21.500
AND I-I-I KNOW IT'S ALL STOLEN.

37:21.533 --> 37:24.567
I-IT'S ALL STOLEN AND--
AND--AND HOSPITALY

37:24.600 --> 37:26.267
AND STOLEN.

37:26.300 --> 37:27.600
YOU CAN TURN ME IN
IF YOU WANT TO.

37:27.633 --> 37:29.767
YOU CAN REPORT ME FOR STEALING,
'CAUSE OBVIOUSLY,

37:29.800 --> 37:30.833
NOW I'M A THIEF.

37:30.867 --> 37:33.433
I'VE NEVER EVEN SHOPLIFTED
A PIECE OF GUM BEFORE,

37:33.467 --> 37:35.700
AND NOW I'M A THIEF,
EXCEPT I'M--I'M NOT.

37:35.733 --> 37:38.833
I'M A NESTER. I'M--I'M NESTING.
THIS IS ME NESTING... FOR YOU

37:38.867 --> 37:41.500
BECAUSE YOU HATE IT HERE.

37:41.533 --> 37:43.400
YOU WANT TO BE
AT THAT BIG HOUSE

37:43.433 --> 37:45.333
WITH MEREDITH AND IZZIE
WHERE THINGS ARE WARM

37:45.367 --> 37:47.300
AND YOU HAVE YOUR FRIENDS

37:47.333 --> 37:49.233
AND--AND THERE AREN'T
ANY ROACHES.

37:49.267 --> 37:51.667
BUT THIS CAN BE WARM, AND I PUT
OUT TRAPS FOR THE ROACHES.

37:51.700 --> 37:55.067
AND--AND I...
I CAN BE YOUR FRIEND.

37:55.100 --> 37:58.400
NO, I-I...
I CAN BE YOUR FRIEND.

37:58.433 --> 38:01.600
I D-DON'T--
I DON'T HAVE ANY FRIENDS HERE,

38:01.633 --> 38:05.233
NOT--NOT REALLY,
EXCEPT YOU.

38:05.267 --> 38:08.133
AND--AND I DON'T HAVE A HOME
TO GO TO ANYMORE,

38:08.167 --> 38:09.500
EX-EXCEPT HERE.

38:09.533 --> 38:11.400
I JUST--I...

38:11.433 --> 38:14.300
I CAN BE YOUR FRIEND.

38:14.333 --> 38:15.267
(sighs)

38:15.300 --> 38:17.200
***

38:17.233 --> 38:19.367
I COMPLAIN A LOT,
DON'T I?

38:19.400 --> 38:22.200
I--IT'S... OKAY.

38:22.233 --> 38:24.600
NO.

38:24.633 --> 38:27.600
NO. YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GONNA STOP.

38:27.633 --> 38:29.567
I'M JUST--I'M JUST
GONNA STOP RIGHT NOW.

38:29.600 --> 38:33.700
I'M GONNA FOCUS ON
WHAT'S GOOD, YOU KNOW,

38:33.733 --> 38:35.633
LIKE, UH,
LIKE THIS CRAPARTMENT,

38:35.667 --> 38:37.600
LIKE THIS APARTMENT.

38:37.633 --> 38:41.200
***

38:41.233 --> 38:44.833
WE ARE EACH OTHER'S KEEPERS.

38:44.867 --> 38:47.767
(sighs)

38:47.800 --> 38:49.700
WISH YOU'D HAVE STOLEN A TV.

38:49.733 --> 38:51.633
I TRIED.
THEY'RE BOLTED TO THE WALLS.

38:51.667 --> 38:53.067
STILL.

38:53.100 --> 38:57.400
WE ARE THE GUARDIANS
OF OUR OWN HUMANITY.

38:57.433 --> 39:00.333
(vibrating)

39:00.367 --> 39:03.700
***

39:11.700 --> 39:13.600
(elevator bell dings)

39:13.633 --> 39:15.200
***

39:15.233 --> 39:17.267
GOOD MORNING.
HOW ARE YOU?

39:17.300 --> 39:18.633
OKAY.
OKAY.

39:18.667 --> 39:20.167
I'LL SEE YOU.

39:20.200 --> 39:23.600
AND EVEN THOUGH THERE'S
A BEAST INSIDE ALL OF US...

39:23.633 --> 39:27.567
***

39:27.600 --> 39:30.300
HI.

39:30.333 --> 39:32.767
I THINK I FOUND A WAY
TO SAVE LIVES.

39:32.800 --> 39:34.700
I DON'T KNOW FOR SURE,
BUT I THINK, UH,

39:34.733 --> 39:37.667
WE CAN SAVE PEOPLE
WHO HAVE THE KIND OF TUMORS

39:37.700 --> 39:38.833
THAT MR. ROBINSON HAS.

39:38.867 --> 39:41.500
MR. ROBINSON--THE MAN WHO
WAS MAULED BY THE--THE BEAR.

39:41.533 --> 39:43.500
I DID ALL THIS RESEARCH,
AND I FOUND THIS.

39:43.533 --> 39:45.467
IT'S RARE, AND IT'S STILL
UNTESTED IN HUMANS,

39:45.500 --> 39:47.833
BUT I COULD FIND PATIENTS
FOR A CLINICAL TRIAL,

39:47.867 --> 39:51.333
AND I COULD DO THE LAB WORK,
AND I COULD TRACK THE RESULTS.

39:51.367 --> 39:55.100
BUT I DO NEED A NEUROSURGEON,
AND YOU'RE ONE OF THE BEST.

39:55.133 --> 39:59.100
IT'S NOT ABOUT US. I WOULD GO
SOMEWHERE ELSE IF I COULD.

39:59.133 --> 40:01.700
BUT... I DON'T KNOW.

40:01.733 --> 40:04.600
I THINK I FOUND A WAY
TO SAVE LIVES.

40:04.633 --> 40:07.433
***

40:07.467 --> 40:09.467
WHAT SETS US APART
FROM THE ANIMALS

40:09.500 --> 40:14.567
IS THAT WE CAN THINK,
FEEL, DREAM AND LOVE.

40:14.600 --> 40:17.600
***

40:20.400 --> 40:24.500
AND AGAINST ALL ODDS...

40:24.533 --> 40:27.700
AGAINST ALL INSTINCT...

40:27.733 --> 40:30.733
***

40:33.533 --> 40:37.800
OKAY. I THINK I BETTER
START TALKING NOW.

40:37.833 --> 40:40.300
***

40:40.333 --> 40:42.667
WE EVOLVE.
