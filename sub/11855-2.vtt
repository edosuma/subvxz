WEBVTT

00:26.166 --> 00:29.625
Never can get enough girls
for all the shifts.

00:29.709 --> 00:31.458
And heaven knows we have to work

00:31.542 --> 00:34.917
24 hours a day for victory.

00:35.000 --> 00:36.750
Sure.

00:36.834 --> 00:39.667
They're a real nice bunch,
you'll see.

00:39.750 --> 00:40.959
This here's Martha.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.792
'Martha, meet Alice Miller.'

00:42.875 --> 00:45.125
Hi there. Joining the line?

00:45.208 --> 00:46.166
I suppose.

00:46.250 --> 00:47.792
Husband overseas?

00:47.875 --> 00:50.125
- Watch it girls.
- Oh, goodness.

00:50.208 --> 00:53.500
Better get that girl
a pair of slacks.

00:53.583 --> 00:54.875
That's Fannie.

00:57.417 --> 00:58.458
Dottie.

00:58.542 --> 00:59.542
This the new girl?

00:59.625 --> 01:02.000
Yes, sir, my neighbor Alice.

01:02.083 --> 01:03.834
Know how to work
a vertical lathe?

01:03.917 --> 01:05.750
I've never worked a
day
in my life.

01:05.834 --> 01:08.125
Oh, it's no tougher than a
sewing machine, you'll see.

01:10.667 --> 01:11.625
What is it?

01:11.709 --> 01:13.917
Air raid siren.
Just practice.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.417
If it was the real thing,
you would have heard

01:15.500 --> 01:16.500
the bombs already.

02:19.667 --> 02:20.875
Lil.

02:20.959 --> 02:22.583
Hey, Dana.

02:22.667 --> 02:24.375
Are these the
Rosie
the Riveters?

02:24.458 --> 02:25.792
Give 'em the parts,
a few weeks

02:25.875 --> 02:28.083
they could build you
a war plane.

02:28.166 --> 02:29.709
How's your story going?

02:29.792 --> 02:31.625
Well, this was the assignment
that nobody wanted.

02:31.709 --> 02:33.333
But my great aunt was
one of the workers.

02:33.417 --> 02:36.834
And turns out, there's
a bigger story here.

02:37.792 --> 02:40.583
Martha, come meet
Lilly Rush.

02:44.417 --> 02:46.542
You're the lady detective?

02:46.625 --> 02:47.792
Nice to meet you.

02:47.875 --> 02:50.375
Martha worked with
my Aunt Alice.

02:50.458 --> 02:52.083
A real nice gal.

02:52.166 --> 02:55.917
Quiet as a mouse, at first,
but couldn't have been
sweeter.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.291
Terrible, what happened?

02:58.542 --> 03:01.417
The official story
was she died in a fall?

03:01.500 --> 03:03.041
But here's the thing.

03:03.125 --> 03:07.083
The night they say she fell
was my last night on the job.

03:07.166 --> 03:09.375
Before I left, I asked the owner

03:09.458 --> 03:11.166
where Alice was..

03:11.250 --> 03:12.583
...wanting to say goodbye.

03:13.709 --> 03:15.083
And?

03:15.166 --> 03:16.333
He told me she quit.

03:16.417 --> 03:18.208
Wasn't working there anymore.

03:18.291 --> 03:19.834
But they found her body
the next day

03:19.917 --> 03:22.000
at the factory
in her work clothes.

03:22.083 --> 03:24.500
Could your memory
be...
mistaken?

03:24.583 --> 03:27.208
Ah...you get old

03:27.291 --> 03:28.834
you start
forgetting things.

03:28.917 --> 03:30.792
You don't start
making them up.

03:33.375 --> 03:34.875
What was the owner's name?

03:34.959 --> 03:35.959
Henry Walker.

03:36.041 --> 03:38.792
Mean as a snake,
and a drinker.

03:38.875 --> 03:41.625
I could smell liquor on
his breath that night.

03:41.709 --> 03:43.375
Guy was hiding something.

03:43.458 --> 03:46.208
Like maybe Alice didn't fall.

03:46.291 --> 03:48.291
Maybe she was pushed.

04:31.750 --> 04:34.667
A 60 year old case?
Talk about your ancients.

04:34.750 --> 04:37.333
- Who brought it to you, Lil?
- Dana Hunter.

04:37.417 --> 04:40.625
Her great aunt died
in a factory accident,
1943.

04:40.709 --> 04:42.000
(Vera)
'Is that that pushy
reporter?'

04:42.083 --> 04:43.834
Yeah, the pretty one.
Covers court.

04:43.917 --> 04:45.750
She's doing a story
on the women of World War II.

04:45.834 --> 04:47.542
Met some of the factory girls
who knew her aunt.

04:47.625 --> 04:49.000
I don't like that Dana.

04:49.083 --> 04:50.917
Yeah, that's 'cause
she covered the Chimayo job.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.583
Kept writing
you had no new leads.

04:55.208 --> 04:57.000
(Valens)
Truth hurts, man.

04:58.959 --> 05:00.542
Anyway now she's thinking
this accident

05:00.625 --> 05:02.083
looks more like homicide.

05:02.166 --> 05:05.125
Say it was. Doer's probably
dead. Whole thing's a
formality.

05:05.208 --> 05:07.291
You just don't want to drive
out
to Records and Storage.

05:08.542 --> 05:09.917
Sixty years, huh?

05:10.000 --> 05:11.500
Sixty one.

05:11.583 --> 05:13.750
Skip it. No one cares.

05:13.834 --> 05:15.000
What's with you?

05:15.083 --> 05:17.041
He's just happy.
It's his anniversary.

05:17.125 --> 05:18.875
(Valens)
'You want to KO this one,
boss?'

05:18.959 --> 05:20.667
Too old to matter?

05:20.750 --> 05:22.208
(Stillman)
'No. Take a drive.'

05:22.291 --> 05:23.959
'See what's there.'

05:24.041 --> 05:26.375
Great, boss. Thanks.

05:30.792 --> 05:33.375
We really need this
"Police Telegraph"?

05:33.458 --> 05:35.083
(Lilly)
'Need everything we can get.'

05:35.166 --> 05:37.625
It's probably, like...one page.

05:37.709 --> 05:38.959
'Oh, we could blow it off.'

05:39.041 --> 05:40.542
60 year old case..

05:40.625 --> 05:42.417
...we're not going
to need much help.

05:42.500 --> 05:44.083
What's the factory report say?

05:44.166 --> 05:45.417
'Accidental death.'

05:45.500 --> 05:48.166
Impact from the fall
broke her neck, but..

05:48.250 --> 05:50.208
Hmm, this is interesting.

05:50.291 --> 05:52.000
Guess who found her body?

05:52.083 --> 05:54.166
Uh...I give up.

05:54.250 --> 05:56.750
- Henry Walker.
- The mean drunk?

05:56.834 --> 05:58.417
The mean drunk who told Martha

05:58.500 --> 05:59.709
Alice didn't work there anymore.

06:00.166 --> 06:01.583
Hmm.

06:01.667 --> 06:04.083
Oh, September '43.

06:04.166 --> 06:07.125
Telegraph from
the 39th
District.

06:07.208 --> 06:08.709
Three pages.

06:08.792 --> 06:10.917
"Alice Miller, age 22.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.417
"Reported missing by husband,
Nelson, 11:20 in the evening."

06:14.500 --> 06:16.875
"He found two whiskey glasses
on the kitchen table

06:16.959 --> 06:19.875
"when he came home,
but...no Alice."

06:19.959 --> 06:21.333
She was partying with someone?

06:21.417 --> 06:24.125
And Henry Walker had liquor
on his breath that night.

06:24.208 --> 06:25.667
Drinking buddies?

06:25.750 --> 06:27.000
Or more?

06:28.000 --> 06:30.166
Problem is, Walker's dead.

06:30.250 --> 06:31.458
1988.

06:31.542 --> 06:32.667
Is anyone alive?

06:34.792 --> 06:36.500
Alice's husband..

06:36.583 --> 06:37.875
...in East Falls.

06:42.709 --> 06:44.625
I never understood
those whiskey glasses.

06:44.709 --> 06:46.792
Alice and I were teetotalers.

06:46.875 --> 06:48.250
You were out
that evening?

06:48.333 --> 06:50.125
Seeing about getting
my old job back.

06:50.208 --> 06:53.375
Got home and don't I find
those
two glasses out on the table?

06:53.458 --> 06:54.583
What time was that?

06:54.667 --> 06:56.458
Oh, eight or so.

06:56.542 --> 07:00.000
I got worried enough
by 11:00 to notify the police.

07:00.083 --> 07:01.667
You didn't know
she'd gone to the
factory?

07:01.750 --> 07:04.417
She'd quit that place the day
I got back from the war.

07:04.500 --> 07:07.166
So you must have been surprised
they found her there.

07:07.250 --> 07:09.625
I'd only been back a few days.

07:09.709 --> 07:11.750
I figured, crossed wires.

07:11.834 --> 07:14.291
Maybe they got her to come back
for one last shift.

07:14.375 --> 07:16.709
- She didn't like the job?
- Oh, she did.

07:16.792 --> 07:19.875
- But she was a "Curtains
Girl".
- What's that?

07:19.959 --> 07:22.834
The saying was,
"When it's curtains for the
Axis

07:22.917 --> 07:25.250
it's lace curtains
for her."

07:25.333 --> 07:28.667
So when the war was done,
back to the kitchen?

07:28.750 --> 07:31.583
I know it's out of fashion
now,
but that's all Alice wanted.

07:32.917 --> 07:35.000
I-I blame myself
for sending her to work.

07:35.083 --> 07:36.875
It was my idea.

07:44.083 --> 07:46.792
Tomatoes do real
well,
so do radishes.

07:46.875 --> 07:48.375
It's so difficult
preparing Nelson's
meals.

07:48.458 --> 07:50.166
He won't eat
that variety
meat.

07:50.250 --> 07:53.417
(Dottie)
'Our boys need the fresh cuts
more than we do.'

07:55.625 --> 07:57.333
Take a look, Nelson.

07:57.417 --> 08:00.125
We've planted
our own Victory Garden.

08:00.208 --> 08:01.458
Swell.

08:04.125 --> 08:05.959
Alice..

08:11.458 --> 08:13.291
(Alice)
'Oh, no.'

08:13.375 --> 08:14.750
We knew this was coming.

08:14.834 --> 08:16.083
What'll I do?

08:16.166 --> 08:17.500
Write me every day.

08:18.250 --> 08:20.291
Pray for victory.

08:20.375 --> 08:22.291
It's his duty, Alice.

08:22.375 --> 08:23.375
I know.

08:23.458 --> 08:25.041
I know.

08:25.125 --> 08:26.458
Look here, Kitten.

08:26.542 --> 08:27.750
"Women wanted."

08:27.834 --> 08:29.250
"For important war work."

08:29.333 --> 08:31.875
Oh, no. I couldn't possibly.

08:31.959 --> 08:34.375
Lot of girls are working
for victory.

08:34.458 --> 08:35.750
I'm too shy.

08:35.834 --> 08:37.500
I'm not cut out
for that kind of thing.

08:37.583 --> 08:38.917
It'll help pass the time.

08:39.834 --> 08:41.959
Bring me home faster.

08:42.041 --> 08:43.667
I'll take you
to the factory Monday.

08:43.750 --> 08:45.625
Introduce you to my boss.

08:45.709 --> 08:48.166
Kitten, give it a try.

08:48.250 --> 08:50.917
You might surprise yourself.

08:57.041 --> 08:58.625
I should have listened to her.

08:58.709 --> 09:00.875
She was too delicate
for that kind of thing.

09:00.959 --> 09:04.458
Ever meet Alice's
boss,
Henry Walker?

09:04.542 --> 09:05.959
No, never did.

09:06.041 --> 09:07.917
(Valens)
'Know any of her
factory friends?'

09:08.000 --> 09:10.500
Just our neighbor Dottie,
who got her the job.

09:10.583 --> 09:12.083
Lives right over there.

09:24.959 --> 09:27.709
I was Mr. Walker's secretary.

09:27.792 --> 09:28.709
Good man?

09:28.792 --> 09:31.291
He was a Christian man..

09:31.375 --> 09:33.291
...but he was in a lot of pain.

09:33.375 --> 09:36.542
He lost two sons
to the war.

09:36.625 --> 09:38.834
Is that why he drank?

09:38.917 --> 09:40.792
[chuckling]
He wasn't a saint.

09:40.875 --> 09:42.542
Think he and Alice
could have had a
drink

09:42.625 --> 09:44.291
together before
work
that night?

09:44.375 --> 09:46.250
Heavens no.

09:46.333 --> 09:49.667
He was the boss, she was..

09:49.750 --> 09:51.792
She was just a factory girl.

09:51.875 --> 09:53.250
It's probably been done before.

09:54.667 --> 09:58.000
More likely it was
one of her new friends.

09:58.083 --> 09:59.333
What new friends?

09:59.417 --> 10:03.291
Alice had started to run
with a fast crowd at Brill.

10:03.375 --> 10:05.500
And they were known
to hit the sauce.

10:05.583 --> 10:07.542
Hmm, so was your boss.

10:07.625 --> 10:12.458
Once again, Mr. Walker
and Alice were not friendly.

10:13.917 --> 10:15.041
What was the problem?

10:17.208 --> 10:19.667
A secretary doesn't
tell secrets.

10:19.750 --> 10:21.333
Mr. Walker's dead, Dottie.

10:21.417 --> 10:24.959
You...you can't hurt him.

10:25.041 --> 10:26.333
Well.

10:27.625 --> 10:30.500
Alice did come to me one day..

10:30.583 --> 10:32.625
(Fannie)
'I say it's rotten,
we girls getting'

10:32.709 --> 10:34.000
the lowest wages.

10:34.083 --> 10:35.917
Why don't you write
Mrs. Roosevelt about it?

10:36.000 --> 10:39.709
She likes to meddle
into unpopular
causes.

10:39.792 --> 10:41.709
Excuse me, Dottie.

10:41.792 --> 10:45.375
You should be on a poster
with that perfect wave.

10:45.458 --> 10:47.917
Am I intruding?

10:48.000 --> 10:49.333
I'll leave you girls.

10:50.834 --> 10:54.625
Stay away from that one.
She's got a past.

10:54.709 --> 10:57.875
So, how are you doing
out on the floor?

10:57.959 --> 11:00.250
I've doubled my pace
on the drill press.

11:00.333 --> 11:02.041
Well, that's fine.

11:02.125 --> 11:04.542
I've noticed something,
Dottie, the last few
weeks.

11:04.625 --> 11:07.208
What's that?

11:07.291 --> 11:09.083
We're missing boxes of rivets.

11:09.166 --> 11:11.333
Every third day
we're short one.

11:11.417 --> 11:12.750
You must be counting wrong.

11:12.834 --> 11:14.834
No. I'm sure of it.

11:14.917 --> 11:17.375
- I thought I'd tell Mr.
Walker.
- I wouldn't.

11:17.458 --> 11:20.375
Someone stealing materials like
that, it's awfully unpatriotic.

11:20.458 --> 11:22.333
Alice, listen to me now.

11:22.417 --> 11:24.291
Don't mention it to Mr. Walker.

11:28.166 --> 11:30.542
Sounds like something the
boss
would want to know.

11:30.625 --> 11:33.750
Unless he was the one
lifting the boxes.

11:33.834 --> 11:37.208
Mr. Walker wasn't a saint.

11:37.291 --> 11:40.250
What can you remember from the
night Alice died, Dottie?

11:40.333 --> 11:42.959
Big event like that probably
stayed in your mind pretty
good.

11:46.041 --> 11:48.750
I do recall that
Mr. Walker disappeared

11:48.834 --> 11:51.583
for quite a while that night.

11:51.667 --> 11:52.959
And..

11:53.709 --> 11:55.959
...that was unusual.

11:56.041 --> 11:59.875
Were you there when he found
Alice the next day?

11:59.959 --> 12:01.041
No.

12:01.125 --> 12:04.166
We worked the night shift
that evening.

12:04.250 --> 12:08.125
He...he shouldn't
have been there in the
morning.

12:21.000 --> 12:24.125
My dad worked
his tail off for
Brill.

12:24.208 --> 12:25.792
If he was there
that morning..

12:25.875 --> 12:29.291
...it's 'cause he
stayed
all night doin' the
books.

12:29.375 --> 12:30.625
He do that a lot?

12:30.709 --> 12:32.041
Pull all-nighters?

12:32.125 --> 12:34.041
Whatever it took.

12:34.125 --> 12:36.000
What about
drinking
on the job?

12:36.083 --> 12:37.625
Was that a regular thing?

12:37.709 --> 12:39.667
Oh, he was a drunk
his whole life.

12:39.750 --> 12:40.959
Died of liver failure.

12:42.542 --> 12:44.291
How 'bout Alice Miller?

12:44.375 --> 12:46.458
How'd she and your
dad get along?

12:46.542 --> 12:48.542
Look, fellas..

12:49.125 --> 12:50.583
I was 17.

12:52.041 --> 12:55.333
I was thinking
'bout other things.

12:55.417 --> 12:58.208
You remember her accusing
him of skimming supplies?

12:59.875 --> 13:01.333
You know about that?

13:01.417 --> 13:03.667
Yeah.

13:03.750 --> 13:05.875
My, uh..

13:05.959 --> 13:08.917
...older brothers
died in the war.

13:10.250 --> 13:12.917
Dad felt he was owed
some payback.

13:13.041 --> 13:14.834
That justified the pilfering?

13:17.208 --> 13:19.208
Alice shouldn't have brought
that up to him.

13:19.291 --> 13:21.125
So she did
confront
him with it?

13:32.125 --> 13:33.458
Wanna go
to the show tonight?

13:33.542 --> 13:34.542
There's something new on.

13:34.625 --> 13:35.834
Yeah. What?

13:35.917 --> 13:37.834
Think it's called
"Casablanca."

13:37.917 --> 13:41.000
Take a girl your own
age.
Someone from school.

13:41.083 --> 13:43.542
Oh, they're all
a bunch of dumb clucks.

13:44.625 --> 13:46.208
Inventory.

13:46.291 --> 13:50.041
Fourteen propellers
assembled,
geared and inspected.

13:50.125 --> 13:51.875
Sixteen for me, dad.

13:51.959 --> 13:53.709
Keep 'em coming.

13:53.792 --> 13:56.333
Um, Mr. Walker,
can I have a moment?

14:00.375 --> 14:03.917
It's about, um...
the blind rivets.

14:04.834 --> 14:06.500
Yes?

14:06.583 --> 14:08.875
They disappear
with
regularity.

14:08.959 --> 14:11.542
Both the Cherry and DuPont.

14:11.625 --> 14:14.417
I-I know what
you're doing.

14:14.500 --> 14:15.834
What?

14:15.917 --> 14:18.208
That you're involved
with side businesses.

14:18.291 --> 14:20.208
You want to be fired
on the spot, Miss Miller?

14:20.291 --> 14:21.333
No.

14:22.667 --> 14:24.917
I want something else.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.333
I need help.

14:29.667 --> 14:31.625
There's someone named Ivan.

14:36.333 --> 14:38.500
Who was Ivan?

14:38.583 --> 14:40.000
Alice had secrets.

14:40.083 --> 14:42.375
No guesses
on what that all meant?

14:43.625 --> 14:46.291
All's I know is..

14:46.375 --> 14:48.917
...she thanked him
for his help.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.959
and said she hoped to heaven
her husband didn't find out.

14:58.291 --> 15:01.208
So who's Ivan?
A boyfriend?

15:01.291 --> 15:03.333
What kind of help
did Alice need?

15:03.417 --> 15:05.667
Whatever it was, she didn't
want
the husband knowing.

15:05.750 --> 15:07.041
Hmm, sounds naughty.

15:07.125 --> 15:09.041
Why does she go to the factory
owner for help?

15:09.125 --> 15:12.959
He had access to something
on the side...underground.

15:13.041 --> 15:14.208
He still a suspect?

15:14.291 --> 15:15.875
Yeah, but his
motive
ain't clear.

15:15.959 --> 15:18.417
Bank records
always come through.

15:18.500 --> 15:19.959
What do you got?

15:20.041 --> 15:22.333
Alice opened up
her own bank account..

15:22.417 --> 15:24.208
...in May 1943.

15:24.291 --> 15:26.291
Made weekly deposits of $35.

15:26.375 --> 15:28.417
- Her factory salary.
- Makes sense.

15:28.500 --> 15:31.375
And it keeps making sense
until July '43..

15:31.458 --> 15:33.166
...when 2,000 bucks shows up.

15:33.250 --> 15:36.000
How's a woman in 1943
get that kind of money?

15:36.083 --> 15:37.834
Like I said, naughty.

15:37.917 --> 15:40.000
Your mind goes right
to the gutter.

15:40.083 --> 15:41.709
Who wants to bet me?

15:41.792 --> 15:43.417
I do. 20 bucks.

15:47.417 --> 15:48.667
Going to court, boss.

15:48.750 --> 15:50.834
Dana dug through her attic
last night..

15:50.917 --> 15:52.792
...has something for me.

15:52.875 --> 15:54.166
Send her my regards.

15:57.583 --> 16:00.125
Mm-mm.
Never heard of
Ivan.

16:00.208 --> 16:02.333
Me, neither.
Where'd you hear the name?

16:02.417 --> 16:04.375
Just came up
in the investigation.

16:04.458 --> 16:07.000
Maybe part of her new crowd
from the factory.

16:07.083 --> 16:09.709
Nelson tells me
Alice was a
writer.

16:09.792 --> 16:10.875
(Lilly)
'Oh, yeah?'

16:10.959 --> 16:12.083
Poems, short stories.

16:12.166 --> 16:14.458
She was too shy
to let anyone read 'em.

16:14.542 --> 16:16.917
But she always said
"Everyone had at least one
story

16:17.000 --> 16:18.250
that could stop your heart."

16:19.333 --> 16:20.667
So you take after her.

16:21.458 --> 16:23.417
I'll let you gals talk.

16:23.500 --> 16:24.875
Now, if you'd packed
your lunch you wouldn't have

16:24.959 --> 16:27.041
to pay six dollars to eat.

16:27.125 --> 16:29.000
Child of the Depression.

16:29.083 --> 16:31.208
Made you a frugal man?

16:31.291 --> 16:34.333
Alice lived through
the Crash, too. She
understood.

16:34.417 --> 16:37.375
A lesser woman might
have minded it. Not her.

16:39.417 --> 16:40.834
Bye.

16:40.917 --> 16:44.250
For years people tried
to set him up after Alice
died..

16:44.333 --> 16:47.875
...and he'd just
say,
"I've had my
wife."

16:50.250 --> 16:52.250
So what'd you find
in the attic?

16:52.333 --> 16:53.792
Oh, her diaries.

16:55.875 --> 16:58.250
These cover the early '40s.

16:58.333 --> 17:01.250
Hmm, maybe she wrote about Ivan.

17:03.417 --> 17:04.917
"Badminton with the gang."

17:05.000 --> 17:07.291
That was the big sport
in '43.

17:07.375 --> 17:10.125
"Took the Pennsy Railroad
to visit mother."

17:10.208 --> 17:12.250
(Valens)
'Amtrak hadn't made
the scene yet.'

17:12.333 --> 17:15.250
Anyone find Henry Walker?
Or Ivan?

17:15.333 --> 17:16.709
Looking.

17:16.792 --> 17:20.458
"Rations on beef means
eggs or horse meat for
supper."

17:20.542 --> 17:21.542
(Valens)
'Horse meat?'

17:21.625 --> 17:23.125
Oh, that's a deal breaker.

17:24.041 --> 17:26.250
Ooh, pay dirt.

17:26.333 --> 17:27.208
Ivan?

17:27.291 --> 17:29.792
Uh, Henry. "June 12, 1943.

17:29.875 --> 17:33.458
"Henry sent me
to Smokey's Dance Hall."

17:53.333 --> 17:55.959
I'm looking for
the owner. Richard?

17:56.041 --> 17:58.542
- Not here.
- Oh, um..

17:58.625 --> 18:01.291
Maybe I can help you.

18:01.375 --> 18:03.291
I doubt it.

18:03.375 --> 18:05.125
What do you want from Richard?

18:05.208 --> 18:07.333
Nylons? Liquor?

18:07.417 --> 18:08.667
Certainly not.

18:08.750 --> 18:11.125
Black market's his specialty.

18:11.208 --> 18:12.917
That's not what I'm after.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.375
Old Stag with soda, Bruno.

18:16.458 --> 18:18.000
You drinking?

18:18.083 --> 18:19.166
I have to get home.

18:19.250 --> 18:20.834
[chuckling
]
For what?

18:20.917 --> 18:23.166
Not the husband or kids.

18:23.250 --> 18:24.709
Dr. IQ on the radio?

18:27.083 --> 18:28.875
Maybe I will have a drink.

18:30.208 --> 18:31.625
On the house.

18:32.959 --> 18:34.208
Yeah.

18:36.250 --> 18:37.542
Lonesome, ain't it?

18:39.750 --> 18:41.542
All the men overseas.

18:41.625 --> 18:43.166
Can be.

18:45.291 --> 18:48.000
They tell you at work
to steer clear of me?

18:48.083 --> 18:50.375
On account
of my checkered past?

18:50.458 --> 18:51.542
No details.

18:51.625 --> 18:53.375
Just to keep your distance.

18:55.291 --> 18:56.834
What did you do?

18:56.917 --> 18:58.250
They say I shot my husband.

18:59.083 --> 19:00.375
And I did, too.

19:01.625 --> 19:02.917
But I had a reason.

19:05.750 --> 19:08.709
Did you kill him?

19:08.792 --> 19:10.375
Just blew up his shoulder.

19:10.458 --> 19:12.250
He ran off after that.

19:14.750 --> 19:17.000
So why did you come
to Smokey's, huh?

19:19.709 --> 19:22.000
I came because
I believed what you
said.

19:28.458 --> 19:30.500
End of entry.

19:30.583 --> 19:33.208
She believed
what Fannie said, when?

19:33.291 --> 19:34.750
Who's Fannie?

19:34.834 --> 19:36.083
One of the factory girls.

19:36.166 --> 19:38.917
You think she really
shot
her husband?

19:39.000 --> 19:41.291
- Better find out.
- I'll go with you.

19:41.375 --> 19:43.750
I'd like to meet
an 80 year old who shot a guy.

19:53.166 --> 19:55.750
Me and Alice, we started
out kinda shaky

19:55.834 --> 19:58.291
but...then we got along.

19:58.375 --> 20:01.291
We pulled an arrest
record
from 1940, Fannie.

20:01.375 --> 20:03.166
Hmm, not my best year.

20:03.250 --> 20:05.959
Seems you shot your husband
in a late-night dispute?

20:06.041 --> 20:09.709
Not until he took a
screwdriver
to my head.

20:09.792 --> 20:12.792
- Yeah, that's in there,
too.
- Humph.

20:12.875 --> 20:16.083
You didn't have any reason
to hurt Alice, did you?

20:16.166 --> 20:17.917
No, sir!

20:18.000 --> 20:19.500
I loved that girl.

20:21.333 --> 20:23.500
You two must have
been an odd pair.

20:23.583 --> 20:27.583
[chuckling]
Wartime made
for unusual companions.

20:27.667 --> 20:30.000
All the men were away.

20:30.083 --> 20:32.458
You made friends
where you could find 'em.

20:32.542 --> 20:34.667
So you and Alice
found each other.

20:34.750 --> 20:38.083
[chuckling]
Making B-25s together
kinda bonds you.

20:39.667 --> 20:42.625
Did you ever hear
her talk about
Ivan?

20:42.709 --> 20:44.083
Sure.

20:44.166 --> 20:45.417
(Will)
'Who was he?'

20:45.500 --> 20:47.583
Her cousin, in Europe.

20:47.667 --> 20:49.959
You see, her family was Jewish.

20:50.041 --> 20:53.834
She hadn't heard from Ivan
in months, which worried her.

20:53.917 --> 20:57.500
And I told her
she had good reason to worry.

21:10.583 --> 21:13.375
I met this seaman
last night at
Smokey's.

21:13.458 --> 21:15.709
You meet a seaman
every night at
Smokey's.

21:17.417 --> 21:19.417
Anyone bring stockings
to donate?

21:19.500 --> 21:20.792
I did.

21:20.875 --> 21:22.375
Penciling in your own
seams
looks just

21:22.458 --> 21:24.166
'as nice as real nylons.'

21:25.417 --> 21:27.834
Matter of opinion.

21:29.583 --> 21:31.542
Smoking now, are we?

21:31.625 --> 21:34.166
Just on breaks.

21:37.542 --> 21:40.083
So this here sailor
just came back from Europe.

21:40.166 --> 21:43.375
He says there's real bad
things
happening over there.

21:43.458 --> 21:44.834
Like what?

21:44.917 --> 21:47.250
Like there's these
camps
for Jews.

21:48.625 --> 21:51.041
We're doin' the
same
to the Japs.

21:51.125 --> 21:53.542
'Cept these aren't
just internment
camps.

21:53.625 --> 21:55.583
Then what are they?

21:55.667 --> 21:57.875
They're killing people there.

21:57.959 --> 22:01.709
We'd be hearing it on Ed Murrow
if that were true.

22:01.792 --> 22:03.875
You sure
they're doing that to Jews?

22:03.959 --> 22:06.166
Herding 'em up
and takin' em off to
die.

22:07.667 --> 22:09.625
- I don't believe it.
- Neither do I.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.041
It seems crazy now.

22:20.125 --> 22:23.083
But most people
didn't know the truth

22:23.166 --> 22:24.500
until the liberation.

22:24.583 --> 22:25.625
Hmm.

22:25.709 --> 22:27.583
So Alice was
trying
to help Ivan?

22:28.834 --> 22:33.333
Smokey's owner was a Portuguese
fellow...Richard.

22:33.417 --> 22:36.250
Had a...contact
in the consulate

22:36.333 --> 22:37.709
who could be helpful
to her.

22:38.542 --> 22:39.834
For a fee.

22:39.917 --> 22:41.792
Said for $2,000

22:41.875 --> 22:44.750
he would smuggle Ivan
into Lisbon.

22:44.834 --> 22:47.041
The amount
in her bank account.

22:47.125 --> 22:50.208
Oh, so...she got the money?

22:51.375 --> 22:53.041
Any idea how?

22:53.125 --> 22:55.083
Well, no thanks to her husband.

22:55.166 --> 22:57.125
So Nelson did know Ivan?

22:57.208 --> 22:59.875
Oh, sure.
And Alice begged him to help..

23:01.333 --> 23:02.750
...but he wouldn't budge.

23:11.208 --> 23:13.417
Thought you didn't know
who Ivan was, Nelson.

23:13.500 --> 23:15.667
You forget he was
your wife's cousin?

23:15.750 --> 23:17.125
No.

23:17.208 --> 23:19.917
Then what?

23:20.000 --> 23:21.333
I want to cooperate.

23:21.417 --> 23:24.291
It's a funny
way
of showing it.

23:24.375 --> 23:25.750
I brought these letters.

23:25.834 --> 23:27.417
All my correspondence
from the war.

23:27.500 --> 23:30.500
Let's not lose focus.
Why did you lie about
Ivan?

23:30.583 --> 23:33.291
Because I didn't believe her.
I didn't think he was in
danger.

23:34.750 --> 23:37.542
Here, this letter
is from Alice, June, '43..

23:37.625 --> 23:39.125
...asking me for the money.

23:39.208 --> 23:41.166
And tellin' you what she
heard
about the camps?

23:41.250 --> 23:44.083
But I was in Europe.
I'd never heard such a thing.

23:44.166 --> 23:45.166
I thought it was just gossip
that she

23:45.250 --> 23:46.750
picked up at the factory.

23:48.417 --> 23:50.875
And you're a frugal man.

23:50.959 --> 23:52.792
So I wrote back and said no.

23:54.083 --> 23:56.875
A few months later,
Ivan was dead.

23:59.125 --> 24:01.792
So how do you figure
Alice came by that
2K?

24:01.875 --> 24:03.333
I don't know how.

24:03.417 --> 24:05.709
But with these letters,
you can tell when.

24:07.709 --> 24:09.458
What do you mean?

24:09.542 --> 24:12.667
She wrote about him in every
letter until July 11.

24:12.750 --> 24:14.125
And then she doesn't
mention him again.

24:14.208 --> 24:16.083
So the problem
was solved by
then.

24:19.709 --> 24:22.000
- Can we hang onto these?
- Please.

24:24.041 --> 24:25.333
I'm sorry I lied.

24:26.709 --> 24:28.542
I just..

24:28.625 --> 24:32.709
...been so ashamed
of this for 60 years.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.709
Between the diaries
and letters, we know

24:37.792 --> 24:40.291
Alice got
that money July
tenth.

24:40.375 --> 24:43.125
A month after she started
trying to raise it.

24:43.208 --> 24:44.834
Could be the month Ivan died.

24:44.917 --> 24:46.542
So what happened
that day, July tenth?

24:46.625 --> 24:48.834
Well, she worked
a day shift then there was a

24:48.917 --> 24:51.333
"Swing for Victory"
dance at Smokey's.

24:51.417 --> 24:53.166
- Smokey's again.
- 'Yeah.'

24:53.250 --> 24:54.667
'I figure something happened
that night.'

24:54.750 --> 24:57.417
Someone she met there,
gave her the 2K.

24:57.500 --> 24:59.333
In exchange for what?

25:00.917 --> 25:02.083
Let's recreate the night.

25:02.166 --> 25:03.375
Go back to Smokey's and take

25:03.458 --> 25:05.250
'Fannie and Martha with us.'

25:05.333 --> 25:06.750
Well, the place is still around.

25:06.834 --> 25:09.417
- An Italian restaurant now.
- There you go.

25:09.500 --> 25:13.750
Scotty found the old owner,
uh, Richard. Retired in
Merion.

25:13.834 --> 25:15.542
Well, between the three
of them maybe they can
piece

25:15.625 --> 25:16.917
together Alice's night.

25:17.000 --> 25:18.333
Let's take a field trip.

25:32.333 --> 25:33.917
Ohh.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.834
Lordy,
I spent a lot of hours here.

25:35.917 --> 25:37.625
(Martha)
'It makes me feel 20 again.'

25:39.125 --> 25:41.917
- You swing?
- Excuse me?

25:42.000 --> 25:43.625
She means, dance.

25:43.709 --> 25:45.834
Oh, right. Uh, no.

25:45.917 --> 25:48.500
I'm a two-left-feet guy.

25:50.542 --> 25:52.959
The good time girls.

25:53.041 --> 25:55.375
- Well, look who's kickin'.
- Oh, Richard.

25:55.458 --> 25:57.417
Francesca.

25:57.500 --> 25:59.375
Martha.

25:59.458 --> 26:02.000
I'm John Stillman,
and this is Lilly Rush.

26:02.083 --> 26:04.583
Ah, how do you do?

26:04.667 --> 26:06.959
You remember our friend
Alice Miller?

26:07.041 --> 26:11.125
A real swell girl palled
around
with us the summer of '43.

26:11.208 --> 26:14.083
Oh, sure.
Ha ha ha.

26:14.166 --> 26:15.709
There was one night
in particular

26:15.792 --> 26:17.834
the Swing for Victory dance.

26:17.917 --> 26:19.959
Big business that night.

26:20.041 --> 26:22.375
I worked the bar with Bruno.

26:22.458 --> 26:26.709
Oh, and I met
a real nice Marine.

26:26.792 --> 26:29.166
And Alice and I were dancing.

26:29.250 --> 26:33.083
Collecting a quarter a song.

26:49.208 --> 26:50.500
That makes three dollars even.

26:50.583 --> 26:52.834
Mmm. Martha.

26:54.625 --> 26:56.667
Was that serviceman
getting fresh with you?

26:56.750 --> 26:58.667
Yes. Lucky thing you came by.

27:00.000 --> 27:01.792
Oil us up, Richard.

27:01.875 --> 27:02.834
What you drinking?

27:02.917 --> 27:04.208
Rum and Coca-Cola.

27:05.375 --> 27:08.709
Saw you out there
breaking hearts, Alice.

27:08.792 --> 27:10.750
With that neckline,
who can overlook her?

27:10.834 --> 27:12.250
Oh, is it too low?

27:12.333 --> 27:14.542
Oh, it's just not the
Alice
we met a few months ago.

27:14.625 --> 27:18.375
I suppose it's just nice having
some men our age around again.

27:18.458 --> 27:20.625
They'll all be shipped off
again soon.

27:20.709 --> 27:23.792
Then it's back to us girls
and the gimps with bad teeth.

27:23.875 --> 27:26.041
We are not all 4-F.

27:28.208 --> 27:30.792
$20 for every
dance
the rest of the
night.

27:30.875 --> 27:33.375
- Why, Buddy.
- Starting right now.

27:33.458 --> 27:34.875
You got to stop this.

27:34.959 --> 27:36.750
You're selling your
dances, I'm buying
'em.

27:36.834 --> 27:38.250
You can't keep
following me.

27:38.333 --> 27:39.709
Behave yourself, Buddy.

27:39.792 --> 27:41.041
Don't treat me like a kid.

27:41.709 --> 27:43.041
You are a kid.

27:43.125 --> 27:44.333
I'm old enough
to go kill
people.

27:44.417 --> 27:46.709
I'm old enough
to be with you.

27:46.792 --> 27:49.166
- Lays it right out, don't
he?
- Mm-hmm.

27:49.250 --> 27:50.542
Let's go for a walk.

27:57.875 --> 28:00.166
So Henry's son was there?

28:00.250 --> 28:01.667
I'd forgotten that.

28:01.750 --> 28:03.625
And Alice left with him?

28:03.709 --> 28:06.083
Don't think I saw her
the rest of the night.

28:06.166 --> 28:10.792
The boy was pretty determined
to get her alone.

28:10.875 --> 28:13.041
Oh, Buddy had it bad for Alice.

28:13.125 --> 28:16.625
And I had forgotten
about that Marine, too.

28:16.709 --> 28:18.291
Oh, look him up.

28:18.375 --> 28:20.041
Maybe he'll get fresh
with you again.

28:20.125 --> 28:21.959
[laughing]
No.

28:25.333 --> 28:27.625
Oh, this Richard
owned a dance hall.

28:27.709 --> 28:29.125
had a colorful career.

28:29.208 --> 28:30.667
He was a horse bookie,
graftman

28:30.750 --> 28:34.667
and proprietor
of a "House of Assignation."

28:34.750 --> 28:36.500
A house of what?

28:36.583 --> 28:39.458
It's polite for whorehouse.

28:39.542 --> 28:41.542
I'm calling
it a night, guys.

28:42.709 --> 28:44.667
Yeah, crap.
I gotta get
home.

28:46.917 --> 28:49.834
You want to hit the Black
Sheep,
have a pint?

28:49.917 --> 28:51.375
No, I'm good.

28:53.583 --> 28:56.291
You talking
to Elisa at
all?

28:56.375 --> 28:59.291
Uh, she's back
in the hospital.

28:59.375 --> 29:00.583
Oh, I didn't
know, Scotty.

29:00.667 --> 29:02.000
You know, it's a circle game.

29:02.917 --> 29:04.709
She's sick, then better.

29:05.959 --> 29:08.291
And for a while
you're hoping and then..

29:09.208 --> 29:10.750
...it starts again.

29:10.834 --> 29:12.542
Yeah.

29:12.625 --> 29:16.208
I just can't go round and
round
with her anymore.

29:33.291 --> 29:36.083
So, I was sweet on Alice.
So what?

29:36.166 --> 29:38.542
Sweet can turn to sour
on a dime.

29:38.625 --> 29:40.333
And if it's "So what?"
why not tell us that

29:40.417 --> 29:42.583
in our first conversation?

29:42.667 --> 29:44.667
It was just a kid's crush.

29:44.750 --> 29:48.083
20 bucks in 1943 was a lot
of money to throw down.

29:48.166 --> 29:50.166
Where's a 17 year old
get cash like that?

29:50.250 --> 29:52.083
My dad.

29:52.166 --> 29:53.667
(Vera)
'Tell us what happened
when you and Alice'

29:53.750 --> 29:55.709
went walking after the dance.

29:55.792 --> 29:56.834
What's it matter?

29:56.917 --> 29:58.542
That wasn't
the night she died.

29:58.625 --> 30:00.542
Then you don't mind
telling us about it.

30:03.333 --> 30:04.417
Oh, Jiminy.

30:07.291 --> 30:09.083
We didn't go walking.

30:10.458 --> 30:11.750
We went driving.

30:34.417 --> 30:36.542
How do you come by gasoline for
this big ol' car

30:36.625 --> 30:38.500
in times like these?

30:38.583 --> 30:40.583
My dad has his ways.

30:44.583 --> 30:46.208
Sorry, Alice.

30:46.291 --> 30:48.834
Honest.
I lost my cool.

30:50.834 --> 30:52.125
Okay.

30:56.333 --> 30:59.208
So, why are you trying
to make money?

30:59.291 --> 31:00.583
To help someone.

31:01.500 --> 31:02.709
Who?

31:03.917 --> 31:05.417
It's complicated.

31:05.500 --> 31:06.792
Never mind about it.

31:07.667 --> 31:08.959
You and your secrets.

31:10.208 --> 31:13.333
- Well, I got a secret, too.
- What's that?

31:13.417 --> 31:17.208
My dad has an account for me,
for when I get called.

31:17.291 --> 31:18.583
Yeah?

31:18.667 --> 31:20.583
He wants me to take it
and run away.

31:20.667 --> 31:22.333
Wait out the war.

31:22.417 --> 31:23.875
He doesn't want to
lose
a third son.

31:23.959 --> 31:26.875
Yeah. But no amount of money
is going to make me run.

31:26.959 --> 31:28.166
I want to serve.

31:28.250 --> 31:30.834
Soon as I turn 18,
do like my brothers did.

31:37.375 --> 31:39.125
I want you to have the money.

31:42.125 --> 31:43.417
I couldn't.

31:45.458 --> 31:47.208
I know I'm just a kid to you.

31:47.291 --> 31:50.417
Buddy, you're a
swell
kind of guy..

31:50.500 --> 31:52.917
...and you're gonna find a
girl
who's just right for you.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.208
Will you wait for me?

31:55.291 --> 31:56.875
I can't.

31:56.959 --> 31:58.458
I ain't scared of dying.

31:58.542 --> 32:00.166
[whispering]
Don't say
that.

32:00.250 --> 32:02.083
But I am scared of going..

32:03.083 --> 32:05.208
...and never having kissed you.

32:10.917 --> 32:13.250
Well, here's a dirty shame.

32:13.333 --> 32:15.417
You're at that window day and
night, aren't you, Dottie?

32:15.500 --> 32:18.792
- I was simply walking Lady.
- Weren't spying at all.

32:18.875 --> 32:20.583
You should be ashamed
of yourself, Buddy.

32:20.667 --> 32:21.583
I'm not.

32:21.667 --> 32:22.750
But you're a red-blooded youth

32:22.834 --> 32:24.667
it's almost understandable.

32:24.750 --> 32:26.041
Please, Dottie.

32:26.125 --> 32:28.709
You have a good man overseas
and he deserves better.

32:28.792 --> 32:30.750
- Someone like you, you mean?
- Maybe so.

32:30.834 --> 32:32.333
I know you'd love that.

32:32.417 --> 32:34.667
Well, listen
to the five-cent tramp.

32:34.750 --> 32:36.333
Says the fussy old maid.

32:47.959 --> 32:49.375
So, you gave her the money.

32:49.458 --> 32:52.417
Two thousand bucks.
No questions asked.

32:52.500 --> 32:55.125
That old maid comment
must have hit below the belt.

32:55.208 --> 32:56.917
Especially back then.

32:57.000 --> 33:00.166
A girl who wasn't
married
was considered a real
flop.

33:01.959 --> 33:03.375
And I guess..

33:03.458 --> 33:06.917
...Dottie was pretty in
love
with Alice's husband.

33:08.500 --> 33:10.792
That could make you want
take a girl out.

33:12.500 --> 33:14.166
Arrange for an accident.

33:19.917 --> 33:21.375
We've been reading
your letters, Dottie.

33:21.458 --> 33:23.834
[sighing]
I don't know what you mean.

33:25.375 --> 33:27.542
(Lilly)
'Wartime correspondence.'

33:30.125 --> 33:32.166
'"Dear Nelson'

33:32.250 --> 33:36.125
"How empty the neighborhood
feels with you gone."

33:36.208 --> 33:37.709
He gave you that?

33:37.792 --> 33:40.208
"I hear the radio
reports every
night

33:40.291 --> 33:42.917
and think of my brave soldier
fighting the Axis."

33:43.000 --> 33:46.417
Now, why are you calling
someone else's husband

33:46.500 --> 33:48.291
"My Soldier?"

33:48.375 --> 33:52.041
Are you accusing me of having
an affair with Nelson?

33:52.667 --> 33:54.083
No, we ain't.

33:56.083 --> 33:57.959
Boy, that Alice
had all the luck.

33:58.041 --> 34:01.625
Popular at work and more
popular
than you ever were.

34:01.709 --> 34:03.917
I wasn't in-interested in that.

34:04.041 --> 34:06.291
Hitting the town nights
with her new girlfriends.

34:06.375 --> 34:08.291
'Going to the show, dancing.'

34:08.375 --> 34:09.834
(Lilly)
'Teenage boys falling for
her'

34:09.917 --> 34:11.458
right there on the street
for all to see.

34:11.542 --> 34:13.208
Why couldn't some stuff
like that happen to you?

34:13.291 --> 34:16.792
Why were you an old maid, and
she was the girl of the hour?

34:16.875 --> 34:19.000
So you know about that night
with Buddy.

34:19.083 --> 34:21.375
Well, she had sweethearts
to spare, and you had none.

34:22.375 --> 34:24.125
All you wanted was Nelson.

34:24.208 --> 34:26.542
And factory
accidents...
did happen.

34:28.709 --> 34:31.542
Alice was changing.

34:31.625 --> 34:32.792
Straying.

34:32.875 --> 34:35.250
I felt Nelson should know.

34:35.333 --> 34:38.333
So you wrote to
him
real faithful.

34:38.417 --> 34:41.125
Maybe he'd get the drift
you'd make the better
wife.

34:41.208 --> 34:42.625
How'd it go
when he got back?

34:43.875 --> 34:46.250
You make your move?

34:46.333 --> 34:48.125
He came home wounded.

34:48.208 --> 34:51.375
And it was plain as day
that Alice didn't know

34:51.458 --> 34:53.250
how to be a good wife anymore.

34:54.875 --> 34:57.208
(Nelson)
'Really nice of you
to bring pie, Dottie.'

34:57.291 --> 34:59.709
Blueberry, too.
Nelson's
favorite.

34:59.792 --> 35:01.875
Kind of a welcome home.

35:01.959 --> 35:04.667
Got any vanilla ice cream,
<i>a la mode.</i>

35:04.750 --> 35:06.625
No, I don't.

35:06.709 --> 35:09.083
I noticed
the Victory Garden's dead.

35:09.166 --> 35:11.333
I didn't keep it up.

35:11.417 --> 35:13.875
House could use a dusting, too.

35:13.959 --> 35:15.291
No pie for me, Dottie.

35:15.375 --> 35:16.750
I'm off to the night shift.

35:16.834 --> 35:18.333
I would think now
that Nelson's home

35:18.417 --> 35:20.333
you'd be done at the factory.

35:20.417 --> 35:23.500
- Easy.
- Oh, heavens, I'm sorry.

35:23.583 --> 35:25.750
(Alice)
'Try this, dear.'

35:25.834 --> 35:27.333
Since when is there
whiskey
in the house?

35:27.417 --> 35:30.458
I thought for your pain.

35:30.542 --> 35:32.709
Do you mean to say,
Alice,
that you're going to keep
on

35:32.792 --> 35:35.208
at Brill,
even with Nelson home?

35:35.291 --> 35:36.917
Turns out I like it there.

35:37.000 --> 35:40.083
- Do you now?
- It's nice feeling useful.

35:40.166 --> 35:43.583
Do you know, Nelson, I helped
build fourteen B-25 Mitchells?

35:44.709 --> 35:46.500
My.

35:46.583 --> 35:48.333
Plus having
my own paycheck.

35:48.417 --> 35:49.709
I give you your allowance.

35:49.792 --> 35:52.542
Just feels different
when you've earned it
yourself.

35:52.625 --> 35:55.750
Well, I work
because I'm a single gal.

35:55.834 --> 35:59.709
If I were married, I'd be more
than content to just keep house

35:59.792 --> 36:02.959
do the washing, bake pies.

36:05.083 --> 36:07.458
I made some nice friends
at the factory, too.

36:07.542 --> 36:10.250
Yeah, I heard
about your
friends.

36:10.333 --> 36:13.250
In particular,
a young teenage
friend.

36:21.667 --> 36:23.041
I'll take these to Martha.

36:23.125 --> 36:25.000
It's her last shift tonight.

36:33.375 --> 36:34.834
More pie?

36:38.792 --> 36:40.500
He didn't go for it, huh?

36:40.583 --> 36:41.834
No.

36:43.166 --> 36:45.291
I'm sure it's amusing
to you young people

36:45.375 --> 36:46.750
but to this day..

36:46.834 --> 36:49.875
...I would jump
for Nelson if he wanted me.

36:49.959 --> 36:51.583
But he wanted Alice.

36:51.667 --> 36:53.041
Mm.

36:53.125 --> 36:55.333
Even after she changed so.

36:55.417 --> 36:57.667
Now, did he go
to the factory that night..

36:57.750 --> 37:00.000
...to set his wife
flying straight
again?

37:02.250 --> 37:04.333
You were real helpful
giving
us Mr. Walker, Dottie.

37:04.417 --> 37:06.792
Is that because you were
protecting someone else?

37:06.875 --> 37:08.458
Nelson is a good man.

37:08.542 --> 37:10.083
(Valens)
'Now, come on, now, Dot.'

37:11.417 --> 37:12.917
He ain't gonna choose you.

37:23.834 --> 37:26.458
I saw him with Mr. Walker
that night.

37:28.625 --> 37:29.917
Where?

37:30.000 --> 37:32.750
They went into his office, late.

37:34.250 --> 37:37.000
Stayed about an hour.

37:37.083 --> 37:39.875
That's pretty surprising,
seeing Nelson there.

37:39.959 --> 37:41.208
Yes.

37:42.375 --> 37:44.208
(Lilly)
'But?'

37:44.291 --> 37:46.750
A secretary
doesn't
tell secrets.

37:46.834 --> 37:48.000
(Valens)
Plus..

37:48.083 --> 37:51.667
...all those feelings
you had for him.

37:51.750 --> 37:54.375
Nelson just wanted the wife

37:54.458 --> 37:57.166
that he had
before he went away.

37:59.250 --> 38:01.208
That war changed everybody.

38:03.125 --> 38:04.834
(Nelson)
'So..'

38:04.917 --> 38:06.417
...news on Alice?

38:09.250 --> 38:10.583
I talked to Dottie.

38:12.667 --> 38:14.709
Is that right?

38:14.792 --> 38:17.834
You knew Alice put those
whiskey
glasses out that night.

38:19.500 --> 38:22.250
And that she went
to the factory.

38:22.333 --> 38:24.083
'Cause you went there, too.

38:33.166 --> 38:34.625
Dottie said that?

38:37.500 --> 38:40.375
Was it the boy?

38:40.458 --> 38:43.291
Or that she didn't need
her allowance anymore?

38:43.375 --> 38:46.875
Didn't make you nice
homemade pies?

38:46.959 --> 38:48.750
You learned a lot.

38:48.834 --> 38:50.291
It's my job.

38:51.834 --> 38:54.000
Well, you're good at it.

38:56.250 --> 38:58.917
I've been reading
Alice's diaries.

38:59.000 --> 39:00.875
Told you she could write.

39:02.458 --> 39:04.166
Did you know
she was so terrified her

39:04.250 --> 39:07.583
first morning of work,
she got sick in the girls
room?

39:07.667 --> 39:09.208
No.

39:09.291 --> 39:11.458
Almost left at lunch time,
'cause she felt her..

39:11.542 --> 39:13.083
"...skills were so poor."

39:13.166 --> 39:14.583
I didn't know that.

39:14.667 --> 39:17.667
And she was so filthy
at the end of that day that.

39:17.750 --> 39:20.417
She got looks
from men on the bus, who..

39:20.500 --> 39:22.500
"Surely take a dim view of..

39:22.583 --> 39:25.875
...working girls
in grubby slacks."

39:25.959 --> 39:28.750
It wasn't easy for
her,
making that change.

39:28.834 --> 39:30.959
No.

39:31.041 --> 39:33.750
But she was brave.

39:33.834 --> 39:36.417
And cleared the way for
the people coming behind her.

39:42.041 --> 39:44.041
[crying]
I loved her.

39:49.083 --> 39:50.375
Then honor her.

39:51.709 --> 39:53.834
Tell the rest
of her story.

39:58.750 --> 40:01.333
I just went
there to ask her to come
home.

40:02.500 --> 40:04.208
And what's so terrible
about that?

40:08.375 --> 40:09.625
Nothing.

40:12.542 --> 40:15.000
The factory owner
saw something, didn't he?

40:17.500 --> 40:19.792
How'd you keep him quiet?

40:19.875 --> 40:21.750
I gave him my war bonds.

40:27.250 --> 40:29.625
I was only away six months..

40:29.709 --> 40:32.625
...but it was like I didn't
know
the girl I came home to.

40:51.959 --> 40:54.250
- Cheers.
- To Martha.

41:03.625 --> 41:05.417
What are you doing here?

41:05.500 --> 41:07.583
We need to talk, Kitten.

41:07.667 --> 41:09.125
You should be home.
You're injured.

41:12.166 --> 41:14.000
I'm sorry, Kitten.

41:15.667 --> 41:16.959
Okay.

41:17.041 --> 41:20.250
Now, let's stop all this
foolishness and get on home.

41:20.333 --> 41:22.667
I'm not off till 6:00.

41:22.750 --> 41:24.041
Forget this place.

41:25.291 --> 41:26.875
I don't think I can.

41:28.959 --> 41:30.792
I don't care
about the boy.

41:31.959 --> 41:33.291
'What Dottie told me.'

41:37.834 --> 41:39.875
I still want to have
a life with you,
Nelson.

41:39.959 --> 41:42.458
- I do love you.
- I love you, Kitten.

41:42.542 --> 41:45.250
It has to be a different
kind of life now. I
changed.

41:46.500 --> 41:47.792
Give it six months.

41:48.667 --> 41:49.792
You'll change back.

41:49.875 --> 41:51.083
No.

41:52.125 --> 41:54.125
I couldn't
bear
to sit home.

41:55.875 --> 41:58.917
Not making anything
of the day, having no
company?

41:59.000 --> 42:00.458
Not now, knowing what I can do.

42:02.333 --> 42:03.959
That there's a whole,
rich life I can have

42:04.041 --> 42:05.375
besides being a wife.

42:05.458 --> 42:06.750
That's enough, now.

42:08.458 --> 42:11.750
- It's that or it's nothing.
- Alice, now, you cut it out!

42:13.000 --> 42:15.583
Nelson, let me go.

42:15.667 --> 42:17.750
[grunting]
I'll let you go.
