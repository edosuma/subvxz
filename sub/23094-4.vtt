WEBVTT

00:00.010 --> 00:02.910
I told you I'm only keeping
it if you finish it with her.

00:02.960 --> 00:06.400
You either go and tell
her now... or that is it.

00:06.450 --> 00:07.930
- Did he love her?
- He was the one that finished it.

00:07.980 --> 00:09.450
That doesn't change anything.

00:09.500 --> 00:10.930
They started last night.

00:10.980 --> 00:13.810
Sometimes people write things
like this on the internet.

00:13.860 --> 00:17.370
- Why? - Someone wants to get at
Mum. - Who? - I'll deal with this.

00:17.420 --> 00:18.850
I found these in your flat.

00:18.900 --> 00:22.690
You're going on holiday.
But stay there a while.

00:22.740 --> 00:26.210
You understand, don't you?
I can't do this for ever.

00:26.260 --> 00:27.970
(I can't have this conversation.)

00:28.020 --> 00:30.570
I'm afraid, last night,
she died in her sleep...

00:30.620 --> 00:32.450
TOM SOBS

00:32.500 --> 00:34.640
'I've changed my mind.'

00:35.540 --> 00:37.090
'We're all right.'

00:37.140 --> 00:39.410
We're going to try again.

00:44.300 --> 00:46.490
TOM: Do we have any butter?

00:46.540 --> 00:49.290
Mate, I used it this
morning. Let me have a look.

00:49.340 --> 00:52.280
- Did you try the fridge?
- CLATTERING

00:53.060 --> 00:54.530
Hey, presto...

00:54.580 --> 00:56.380
The butter(!)

00:58.100 --> 01:00.840
What did your last servant die of?

01:02.180 --> 01:04.410
- Cholera?
- What's cholera?

01:04.459 --> 01:07.010
Cholera is like typhoid.

01:07.060 --> 01:09.450
MOCKING: "What's typhoid?"

01:09.500 --> 01:11.730
Typhoid is what?

01:11.780 --> 01:14.770
- Typhoid? - Typhoid, it's very
serious. - What's Thai food?

01:14.820 --> 01:17.250
- Do you want lemon curd?
- I thought you said, "Typhoo".

01:17.300 --> 01:19.570
Typhoo is a brand of tea.

01:20.420 --> 01:24.580
Thai food is... quite nice.

01:27.140 --> 01:29.580
Lemon curd! [SHE CHUCKLES]

01:32.420 --> 01:36.050
- 'So, he still hasn't admitted it?
- I doubt he ever will.'

01:36.100 --> 01:39.570
- And you haven't told him, that you know?
- We're just moving on.

01:39.620 --> 01:43.130
With this massive secret sat
underneath the relationship?!

01:43.180 --> 01:45.250
- Can I speak with you?
- Sure.

01:45.300 --> 01:46.330
Two minutes.

01:46.380 --> 01:48.720
- Excuse me.
- KEYS JANGLE

01:53.620 --> 01:56.890
You're sure you're OK?
It's just very sudden.

01:56.940 --> 02:00.570
After everything, how can
you simply take him back?

02:00.620 --> 02:02.930
Because we have a child together,

02:02.980 --> 02:05.970
a life together, 14 years under our belt,

02:06.020 --> 02:08.690
so if there's any way of keeping
all of that, I have to try.

02:08.740 --> 02:12.050
And you honestly think that he's
never going to see her again?

02:12.100 --> 02:14.090
I'm told when they broke
up, it was very final.

02:14.140 --> 02:16.940
- Nick?
- There's been a complaint.

02:20.060 --> 02:21.970
Fantastic(!) Another one.

02:22.020 --> 02:24.360
The power of the internet.

02:24.820 --> 02:26.850
The latest yesterday
was that I don't dress

02:26.900 --> 02:28.770
appropriately for a senior doctor.

02:28.820 --> 02:30.570
He was annoyed I wore a skirt.

02:30.620 --> 02:33.090
Um, this one's not online.

02:33.140 --> 02:37.690
- He came in and asked to speak
to me personally. - Who is it?

02:37.740 --> 02:41.290
He's requested anonymity
for the time being.

02:41.340 --> 02:43.450
- I'm speaking to the GMC.
- Why the GMC?

02:43.500 --> 02:45.610
Doctors get complaints all the time.

02:45.660 --> 02:49.370
Yes, but as you say, there's
also the comments on the website,

02:49.420 --> 02:53.740
and, um, what... what happened
with your mother-in-law.

02:55.540 --> 02:59.530
My mother-in-law took her own
life, I don't know why everyone...

02:59.580 --> 03:02.810
It's as much about protecting you
as anything. This new complaint.

03:02.860 --> 03:06.100
- He talked about your personal
life, your marriage. - Wait.

03:09.420 --> 03:11.850
You really can't tell me who this is?

03:11.900 --> 03:13.940
Sorry.

03:15.060 --> 03:16.540
Fine.

Gordon!

05:00.420 --> 05:01.890
Long time no see!

05:01.940 --> 05:04.770
- You're not normally sarcastic.
- Sorry?

05:04.820 --> 05:08.100
- "Long time no see." That's what
I expect from the others. - Sorry.

05:09.300 --> 05:10.410
Come on.

05:10.460 --> 05:12.400
Come in, sit down.

05:18.460 --> 05:20.930
[SHE SIGHS] Let's start again.

05:20.980 --> 05:22.490
What's wrong?

05:22.540 --> 05:24.170
My shoes don't fit any more.

05:24.220 --> 05:26.290
- Your shoes?
- Yes.

05:27.660 --> 05:30.860
There must be something
wrong with my feet.

05:35.660 --> 05:37.930
- So, were you sick?
- I don't think you're picking up

05:37.980 --> 05:40.410
- on the right bit of the story.
- Yeah, Mum just said,

05:40.460 --> 05:43.090
- when you and her met, you
had a few too many. - Me? No.

05:43.140 --> 05:45.770
- Only one of us was tipsy that night.
- CLATTERING

05:45.820 --> 05:48.410
- Oh, shit. - You OK? - Yeah, yeah.

05:48.460 --> 05:50.050
You want to be careful with alcohol.

05:50.100 --> 05:52.770
Makes you say things you
shouldn't, and... stand on chairs.

05:52.820 --> 05:54.450
What do you mean?

05:54.500 --> 05:57.210
- I think we need to tell
him the whole thing. - Fine.

05:57.260 --> 06:00.210
It was your mum who'd
drunk too much that night.

06:00.260 --> 06:04.970
She stood on this chair,
looked around, and then saw me,

06:05.020 --> 06:08.770
- pointed, and said I was the
best-looking man in the room. - You?

06:08.820 --> 06:11.850
Your dad was younger then, and the
room was not in a very nice pub...

06:11.900 --> 06:14.610
- That's true, there wasn't much
competition. - So, then what?

06:14.660 --> 06:16.930
They started to play ABBA,

06:16.980 --> 06:21.450
I tried to dance on the
chair, but fell off.

06:21.500 --> 06:26.370
Your dad helped me up and said
that maybe I should have some food.

06:26.420 --> 06:27.650
We got a curry.

06:27.700 --> 06:29.840
And that's how we met.

06:37.180 --> 06:39.490
Oh, God! It's today.

06:39.540 --> 06:43.090
- That's why you were talking about
it. Ah...! - Um... - I'm an idiot.

06:43.140 --> 06:44.490
Don't worry.

06:44.540 --> 06:47.210
- [HE SIGHS] I'm so sorry.
- What have you done?

06:47.260 --> 06:51.970
Every year, since then, on the 26th
of May, your mum makes a curry.

06:52.020 --> 06:54.170
And I get her a card.

06:54.220 --> 06:55.930
And you forgot?

06:55.980 --> 06:58.520
Dad, you are RUBBISH sometimes.

06:59.540 --> 07:01.450
- Yeah.
- Well...

07:01.500 --> 07:02.890
Honestly.

07:02.940 --> 07:05.280
It's OK. You've been busy.

07:06.180 --> 07:07.570
Simon!

07:07.620 --> 07:09.530
Um...

07:09.580 --> 07:11.050
um...

07:11.100 --> 07:12.930
- oh!
- SHE CHUCKLES

07:12.980 --> 07:15.020
You liar!

07:18.020 --> 07:20.020
Oh, look!

07:23.660 --> 07:26.060
- Can I see?
- NO!

07:30.380 --> 07:31.920
Thank you.

08:51.780 --> 08:55.380
THEY PANT

09:10.820 --> 09:13.490
Everything's going wrong at work.

09:15.460 --> 09:16.890
Can I do anything?

09:16.940 --> 09:19.410
Yeah, will you beat them up?

09:19.460 --> 09:21.220
Tuesday?

09:22.660 --> 09:24.260
Perfect.

09:25.860 --> 09:27.460
THEY CHUCKLE

09:30.020 --> 09:31.560
TEXT ALERT

09:38.900 --> 09:41.090
Everything all right?

09:41.140 --> 09:43.580
Yeah. Just, it's a problem.

09:46.820 --> 09:48.890
At work?

09:48.940 --> 09:51.100
Yeah. Yeah, it's fine.

10:06.100 --> 10:08.570
- Can I have a word?
- Sure.

10:18.540 --> 10:19.810
Ah.

10:19.860 --> 10:23.010
- Sorry, can you sit on this side?
- There's only three of us Nick,

10:23.060 --> 10:26.610
- I'm not sure it matters.
- We should take it seriously.

10:26.660 --> 10:28.730
- Here?
- Thank you.

10:35.180 --> 10:40.210
You've got the outline
details of the complaint there

10:40.260 --> 10:43.580
that you threatened to burn
this man with a lit cigarette.

10:46.660 --> 10:48.930
I'm assuming you deny it?

10:50.540 --> 10:55.450
- Of course. - As you know, normally
there are internal procedures.

10:55.500 --> 10:57.130
There are.

10:57.180 --> 10:58.810
But, er,

10:58.860 --> 11:00.970
I spoke to the GMC this morning

11:01.020 --> 11:04.610
and they indicated that we should
consider the wider context...

11:04.660 --> 11:07.650
- What's going on? - Gemma, if you
let Nick finish, he'll explain.

11:07.700 --> 11:10.410
Obviously, the online
comments are anonymous

11:10.460 --> 11:12.370
but we can't ignore them entirely.

11:12.420 --> 11:17.300
To an outside eye, they might appear
to have... a pattern of behaviour.

11:18.460 --> 11:21.850
Also we've had the police here,

11:21.900 --> 11:25.090
asking questions about the
death of your mother-in-law.

11:25.140 --> 11:29.180
- Who talked to them? - Luke,
mostly, he was... - "Mostly"?

11:31.980 --> 11:34.610
They asked about some things
to do with procedure, as well.

11:34.660 --> 11:37.210
Do you think that I've
done anything wrong?

11:37.260 --> 11:39.730
- There needs to be a process.
- No, but...

11:39.780 --> 11:43.490
- You, personally, Nick.
What do you think? - Well...

11:43.540 --> 11:46.290
You have been going through
a lot lately, in your life.

11:46.340 --> 11:49.850
- How is that relevant?
- You said we were talking personally.

11:49.900 --> 11:53.730
The GMC have suggested we mutually agree

11:53.780 --> 11:57.210
you take a leave of absence, informally,

11:57.260 --> 12:01.010
while the complaint is investigated
and we look at the website.

12:01.060 --> 12:05.050
- It would help, as well, wouldn't
it, to have some time off? - No.

12:05.100 --> 12:07.290
What if I don't agree?

12:07.340 --> 12:11.290
Then we'd have to look
at a temporary suspension.

12:11.340 --> 12:14.940
And, Gemma, that would be so much worse.

12:21.380 --> 12:22.820
When?

12:24.100 --> 12:26.170
When do you want me to stop, then?

12:26.220 --> 12:27.820
Immediately.

12:53.420 --> 12:56.060
RUMMAGING

13:11.540 --> 13:14.930
You don't have to pack up.
It's only a couple of weeks.

13:14.980 --> 13:18.450
Presumably, while I'm away,
you'll become senior partner?

13:18.500 --> 13:20.840
You think I want you to go?

13:21.780 --> 13:24.690
We're following professional advice.

13:24.740 --> 13:26.680
It's not my fault.

13:27.420 --> 13:28.850
I helped you!

13:28.900 --> 13:32.130
I told you everything about Kate
and the baby, I spoke to Simon,

13:32.180 --> 13:33.850
did everything you asked.

13:33.900 --> 13:36.610
Then suddenly you're giving him
another chance which is up to you,

13:36.660 --> 13:39.330
but forgive me if I stop trying to keep up

13:39.380 --> 13:41.650
and take a step back,
and act professionally.

13:41.700 --> 13:43.040
Gemma!

13:47.460 --> 13:51.020
Whatever's going on, some time off
would be a good idea, wouldn't it?

13:53.700 --> 13:56.170
What did you tell the police?

13:56.460 --> 13:59.250
- What? - You said they
asked about procedure?

13:59.300 --> 14:04.010
- Yes. - Something was said to
them here to make them suspect me.

14:04.060 --> 14:07.770
All right, well, er, they asked
about our access to pills.

14:07.820 --> 14:10.890
- And I told them what I found in your bag.
- Why were you looking in my bag?

14:10.940 --> 14:12.490
I wasn't looking!

14:12.540 --> 14:16.490
I needed some hand gel and your bag
was there on the side and open,

14:16.540 --> 14:20.650
and when I found it, I
saw that there was...

14:20.700 --> 14:24.890
a bottle of sleeping pills with
some anti-sickness medication.

14:24.940 --> 14:27.810
And then, the next day, your
mother-in-law did what she did...

14:27.860 --> 14:29.370
- They were Jack's.
- So, I...

14:29.420 --> 14:31.090
Jack's?

14:31.140 --> 14:32.850
He wanted to kill himself.

14:32.900 --> 14:34.900
I took them off him.

14:35.980 --> 14:38.130
You still have them, then, in your bag?

14:38.180 --> 14:40.060
Yeah.

14:43.300 --> 14:44.640
I have.

14:55.260 --> 14:58.690
- I don't know where they've gone, I
had them... - Oh, Gemma...! - Don't!

14:58.740 --> 15:01.080
Don't make me feel stupid.

15:06.260 --> 15:08.140
They were there.

15:17.260 --> 15:19.730
I'll tell the police I made a mistake.

15:19.780 --> 15:21.720
But take this time.

15:23.300 --> 15:25.540
GEMMA SIGHS

15:41.100 --> 15:43.970
- They said I have to
see someone else. - Yes.

15:44.020 --> 15:46.210
- The other doctors laugh at
me. - They don't. - They do.

15:46.260 --> 15:49.620
- You know they do. What's happened?
- Google me and you'll find out.

15:51.140 --> 15:52.620
Sorry.

15:55.860 --> 15:58.060
THUNDER RUMBLES

16:06.940 --> 16:08.810
Hi.

16:08.860 --> 16:10.810
That's what I thought.

16:10.860 --> 16:14.450
- You're back with Carly?
- Yeah, not drinking any more.

16:14.500 --> 16:17.050
I was suspended today
because of your complaint.

16:17.100 --> 16:19.450
You know why I came round that day.

16:19.500 --> 16:22.930
- She needed help. - No... You found
out what your husband was doing.

16:22.980 --> 16:24.810
You were angry, you took it out on me.

16:24.860 --> 16:28.690
- Look, I'm pleased if you've
sorted yourself out. - Not "if".

16:28.740 --> 16:31.940
- Carly's given you a
second chance. - Yeah.

16:32.260 --> 16:33.690
Give me a second chance, too?

16:33.740 --> 16:37.580
- Carly showed me the website.
You're out of control. - No.

16:38.860 --> 16:41.210
I've been through a lot
in the last few weeks,

16:41.260 --> 16:43.410
but things are better now.

16:43.460 --> 16:46.450
Please. I-I can't stop working. I need it.

16:46.500 --> 16:47.650
FOOTSTEPS APPROACH

16:47.700 --> 16:49.450
Carly?

16:49.500 --> 16:50.970
They've suspended her.

16:51.020 --> 16:52.290
Um...

16:53.700 --> 16:56.450
OK, Dan, maybe you should tell
them not to go forward with this.

16:56.500 --> 16:59.770
Have you admitted it?
Said that... What happened?

16:59.820 --> 17:03.620
They'd start a disciplinary
procedure and I can't...

17:07.619 --> 17:09.089
How much?

17:10.980 --> 17:13.720
How much to withdraw the complaint.

17:16.060 --> 17:19.060
You really need to stop offering me money.

17:20.140 --> 17:21.410
Yeah.

17:24.619 --> 17:25.760
OK.

17:42.180 --> 17:43.450
SHE SIGHS

17:43.500 --> 17:45.340
SHE PANTS

17:52.180 --> 17:53.850
Come on, son.

17:54.860 --> 17:56.130
Go on, Tom.

17:56.180 --> 17:59.500
CHEERING, SHOUTING NEARBY

18:05.780 --> 18:08.060
SIMON CHEERS

18:25.500 --> 18:29.050
- Leave it with me. Hey!
My favourite doctor! - Hi.

18:29.100 --> 18:30.450
Hi!

18:30.500 --> 18:31.610
Hi.

18:31.660 --> 18:34.490
Well, your husband's
taking this very seriously.

18:34.540 --> 18:37.490
Well, he was never very good at
sports himself, so it matters.

18:37.540 --> 18:39.300
He's just same!

18:41.340 --> 18:42.610
How are you?

18:42.660 --> 18:44.730
Good, thanks.

18:44.780 --> 18:46.290
You going out?

18:46.340 --> 18:49.370
- What?
- She's talking about the skirt.

18:49.420 --> 18:52.650
- I had the same question, but
she's 20 something... - 23.

18:52.700 --> 18:55.050
- Yeah, well, apparently I
don't get a vote. - I like it.

18:55.100 --> 18:57.370
- Yeah, I'm sure the boys do, as well!
- Yeah, shut up, Dad!

18:57.420 --> 18:59.890
CHEERING AND GROANING

18:59.940 --> 19:03.450
Get up! At least I could
run in a straight line!

19:03.500 --> 19:05.860
Get up! That's better.

19:09.580 --> 19:12.450
I've been meaning to say, it is ridiculous

19:12.500 --> 19:14.770
that we haven't all got
together, the four of us.

19:14.820 --> 19:17.290
- It's what happens when you leave
it to the men. - Sounds fun.

19:17.340 --> 19:19.940
- I'll e-mail you. - Bye. - Bye.

19:21.300 --> 19:23.890
Oh, so close!

19:23.940 --> 19:25.490
CHEERING

19:25.540 --> 19:27.340
Come on, Tom.>

19:30.140 --> 19:31.680
Nice ball.

19:35.340 --> 19:38.620
- I thought you were at work?
- I wanted to see our son.

19:42.500 --> 19:44.220
Come on, Tom!

19:45.420 --> 19:47.220
WHISTLE BLOWS

19:53.180 --> 19:55.050
Simon, the, uh...

19:56.540 --> 19:59.410
.. the partners at work...

19:59.460 --> 20:04.010
um, have asked me to take some
time off pending an investigation.

20:04.060 --> 20:08.090
- You mean? - Suspended
me, effectively. - Why?

20:08.140 --> 20:12.930
There's been a formal complaint
that I went to the home of a patient

20:12.980 --> 20:16.570
and... assaulted him.

20:16.620 --> 20:19.700
[HE SCOFFS] Assaulted him? You?

20:20.900 --> 20:22.570
Ros, she... she's a partner.

20:22.620 --> 20:25.610
- Can't she? - There's been
the stuff on the internet,

20:25.660 --> 20:29.530
and the police have been around
asking questions about your mum.

20:29.580 --> 20:31.210
Apparently, that...

20:31.260 --> 20:33.290
"paints a picture". Sorry!

20:33.340 --> 20:35.080
It's all right.

20:37.220 --> 20:40.420
- OK, OK, it'll be all right.
- SHE SOBS

20:45.180 --> 20:46.780
Thank you.

20:49.180 --> 20:50.720
Thank you.

20:53.140 --> 20:55.140
TEXT ALERT

20:59.300 --> 21:01.580
- That was you.
- Yeah.

21:02.940 --> 21:04.090
Right, sorry.

21:04.140 --> 21:06.610
I didn't want to...

21:06.660 --> 21:09.450
- Who is it?
- Work.

21:09.500 --> 21:10.700
OK.

21:13.220 --> 21:15.560
Are you not going to reply?

21:16.540 --> 21:18.890
I don't mind if you want to.

21:18.940 --> 21:20.300
What?

21:21.410 --> 21:22.410
What's going on?

21:22.460 --> 21:25.000
When you got the text, your...

21:25.820 --> 21:27.450
.. your body went tense.

21:27.500 --> 21:30.970
I was surprised. That's what
people do when they're surprised.

21:31.020 --> 21:34.320
- OK. Honestly. You can reply.
- You still...

21:36.220 --> 21:37.810
You still...

21:37.860 --> 21:40.170
You think I'm lying?

21:40.220 --> 21:42.130
You still don't trust me?

21:42.180 --> 21:45.290
Look, do you want to see the text?

21:45.340 --> 21:50.170
Time, date, details of the supplies
for the foundations. Here. Look.

21:50.220 --> 21:52.370
No. It's fine.

21:52.420 --> 21:54.330
Well done!

21:54.380 --> 21:55.650
We lost.

21:55.700 --> 21:57.330
Only just,

21:57.380 --> 21:59.290
and not because of you.

21:59.340 --> 22:01.730
Right. Two cars. Who are
you going to go with?

22:01.780 --> 22:04.650
No offence, Mum, but you don't
know much about football

22:04.700 --> 22:06.290
and me and Dad have to talk.

22:06.340 --> 22:08.050
TEXT ALERT

22:08.100 --> 22:09.930
Where to? Somewhere to celebrate?

22:09.980 --> 22:11.290
Celebrate what?

22:11.340 --> 22:13.290
- You, of course!
- Oh.

22:13.340 --> 22:14.770
Pizza?

22:14.820 --> 22:17.850
Yeah, actually, that would be really good.

22:17.900 --> 22:19.410
Simon? Pizza?

22:19.460 --> 22:21.090
Argh, really sorry.

22:21.140 --> 22:22.490
Crisis.

22:22.540 --> 22:23.810
What?

22:25.780 --> 22:27.370
The thing with the supplies.

22:27.420 --> 22:30.010
We need to talk about
options, today, sorry.

22:30.060 --> 22:33.850
Boring. Um, I'll just be a couple
of hours. I'll join you later.

22:33.900 --> 22:37.690
Pizza is a great idea. You can
teach Mum about the offside rule!

22:37.740 --> 22:40.940
Well, why can't you come now,
and sort out your problem later?

22:42.980 --> 22:46.180
Sorry, mate. It just
doesn't work like that.

22:47.500 --> 22:51.380
- I'll be around tonight and we
can catch up then, yeah? - OK.

22:58.420 --> 22:59.930
You already know the offside rule.

22:59.980 --> 23:01.490
CAR STARTS

23:01.540 --> 23:02.930
Yeah.

23:02.980 --> 23:05.090
Is there anything you don't know?

23:05.140 --> 23:06.810
CAR DRIVES AWAY

23:06.860 --> 23:08.460
Quite a lot.

23:21.780 --> 23:23.660
Dad!

23:25.420 --> 23:28.090
He works really hard, doesn't he?

23:45.620 --> 23:47.170
Mum!

23:47.220 --> 23:48.620
Mum!

23:51.860 --> 23:53.050
Mum!

23:53.100 --> 23:55.440
You're going the wrong way!

24:11.460 --> 24:13.290
I need five minutes with your dad.

24:13.340 --> 24:14.970
You said we were having pizza.

24:15.020 --> 24:17.130
[SHE SIGHS] Do your homework.

24:17.180 --> 24:18.970
I want to come in!

24:19.020 --> 24:20.560
You can't.

24:25.100 --> 24:26.980
HE EXHALES

24:43.340 --> 24:45.480
- Oh, shit...
- What?

24:47.460 --> 24:49.130
Your face.

24:49.180 --> 24:52.210
I, um... I didn't know
you were coming over.

24:52.260 --> 24:53.450
They normally buzz up.

24:53.500 --> 24:55.690
I told them that I wanted
to surprise my husband.

24:55.740 --> 24:57.690
I'm not having a good day. Is he in there?

24:57.740 --> 24:59.650
He's on the phone. Gemma, are you...?

24:59.700 --> 25:02.240
You're holding something back.

25:03.420 --> 25:05.130
I mean...

25:05.180 --> 25:08.650
I mean, you've been doing
that for a long time, but...

25:08.700 --> 25:10.840
.. something's changed.

25:11.820 --> 25:15.580
- You've suddenly become really bad at lying.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

25:18.460 --> 25:19.730
Does my husband bully you?

25:19.780 --> 25:22.450
I mean, not physically,

25:22.500 --> 25:24.640
but he patronises you.

25:26.420 --> 25:28.810
I suppose, that's why men
want female assistants.

25:28.860 --> 25:32.060
So, they can push at
least one woman around.

25:33.980 --> 25:36.490
- You've been covering for him for years.
- I don't... cover.

25:36.540 --> 25:41.010
- I'd like to believe that.
- Well, you should. - But your face.

25:41.060 --> 25:43.570
Look, if you take a seat,
when he's off the phone,

25:43.620 --> 25:46.010
- I'll let him know that you're here.
- I wanted his support.

25:46.060 --> 25:49.810
I've basically just lost my job, but
from the expression on your face,

25:49.860 --> 25:53.560
I think he's off having
sex with Kate Parks again.

25:56.060 --> 25:58.460
You split with your husband.

25:58.900 --> 26:02.600
So, you can imagine something
of what I'm feeling.

26:04.260 --> 26:06.400
I've known for a while.

26:09.660 --> 26:11.600
They have no idea.

26:12.380 --> 26:14.380
Well, they will now.

26:15.580 --> 26:17.850
I assume it's not locked.

26:24.900 --> 26:26.500
Where is he?

26:27.780 --> 26:29.720
His car's outside.

26:32.780 --> 26:34.050
Well?

26:36.060 --> 26:37.490
What?

26:37.540 --> 26:41.780
He was always worried that someone
might follow him or see him.

26:43.060 --> 26:45.000
They had a system.

26:45.820 --> 26:49.220
You can get out from the
back of the building.

27:27.740 --> 27:30.700
SHE SOBS AND THUDS

27:46.500 --> 27:48.170
They're back together.

27:48.220 --> 27:50.370
He'll never leave her.

27:50.420 --> 27:54.120
I kept telling him to stop.
I HATE what he's doing.

28:06.220 --> 28:07.490
You went on holiday with them.

28:07.540 --> 28:11.610
- He said he needed me, that they'd
be working... - Where did you go?

28:11.660 --> 28:13.890
Kate's dad has a house in France.

28:13.940 --> 28:15.930
Said she could use it for friends.

28:15.980 --> 28:17.090
Her dad wasn't there?

28:17.140 --> 28:19.250
No. They don't know about Simon.

28:19.300 --> 28:21.130
He'd kill him if he did.

28:21.180 --> 28:24.010
- Show me pictures.
- What...?

28:24.060 --> 28:26.170
Of the holiday. On your phone.

28:26.220 --> 28:29.010
You, him, her. Neil, Anna. I want to see.

28:29.060 --> 28:30.370
Why would you want to see?

28:30.420 --> 28:33.490
I thought that I had a
chance to sort this out,

28:33.540 --> 28:36.010
but, clearly, I'm delusional!

28:51.820 --> 28:56.010
Look, not that it matters
but, yeah, you're right.

28:56.060 --> 28:58.130
He can be horrible.

28:58.180 --> 29:02.220
- Especially when he's stressed.
- Can you e-mail these to me? - I...

29:06.140 --> 29:07.610
If you want.

29:07.660 --> 29:10.050
- And don't tell him I know.
- Why not?

29:10.100 --> 29:12.240
I want to do it myself.

29:13.060 --> 29:15.400
- But not now.
- Do what?

29:16.820 --> 29:20.220
- I told you to stay in the car.
- Where's Dad?

29:23.540 --> 29:27.500
Mum, what's wrong with you?
You're so weird at the moment.

29:28.860 --> 29:30.060
Mum!

29:30.940 --> 29:33.130
Why are you such a mad bitch?

29:33.180 --> 29:34.720
It's scary.

29:37.380 --> 29:40.580
Your dad's gone out for
a couple of minutes.

29:42.740 --> 29:45.290
You know Becky, don't you?
Becky, could you text Simon,

29:45.340 --> 29:47.450
tell him that his son's
waiting in his office

29:47.500 --> 29:49.890
and needs some pizza before going home?

29:49.940 --> 29:52.890
And then, when he gets
back, could you explain

29:52.940 --> 29:56.780
that I've forgotten that I need
to go to a conference... tonight.

29:58.020 --> 29:59.970
I need to leave immediately.

30:00.020 --> 30:02.210
- Be gone a few days.
- What?

30:02.260 --> 30:04.890
Your dad'll look after you.
You can talk about football.

30:04.940 --> 30:07.290
- A conference? It's always work! - Yes?

30:07.340 --> 30:09.290
OK.

30:09.340 --> 30:10.610
Good.

30:12.780 --> 30:14.320
Bye, then.

30:15.700 --> 30:17.260
Bye.

30:18.220 --> 30:19.500
Mum!

30:20.740 --> 30:22.220
SHE SIGHS

30:26.300 --> 30:28.490
SHE LAUGHS

30:28.540 --> 30:31.930
You're too clever! All right.

30:31.980 --> 30:33.610
Look, there is no conference.

30:33.660 --> 30:36.410
That's a lie Becky and I
are going to tell your dad,

30:36.460 --> 30:39.370
because I just can't deal
with everything at the moment

30:39.420 --> 30:41.450
so I need to go away for a couple of days.

30:41.500 --> 30:45.490
And I don't want him to worry,
so... I'm making an excuse.

30:45.540 --> 30:47.170
Now, you have a choice.

30:47.220 --> 30:49.970
You can tell Dad the truth,
or you can join me and Becky

30:50.020 --> 30:52.560
and tell him it's a conference.

30:53.420 --> 30:55.490
- It's up to you.
- HE SIGHS

30:55.540 --> 30:57.280
Don't do that!

30:58.580 --> 31:00.520
Your dad does that.

31:02.220 --> 31:04.890
What do you mean, you
can't deal with everything?

31:04.940 --> 31:07.080
Life's hard sometimes.

31:08.020 --> 31:11.300
- How long are you gone for?
- Couple of days.

31:13.740 --> 31:16.220
- OK.
- Good boy.

31:20.980 --> 31:22.900
See you soon.

31:45.060 --> 31:46.820
MOBILE RINGS

32:03.620 --> 32:05.260
MOBILE RINGS

32:21.460 --> 32:22.730
Shit!

32:35.100 --> 32:37.020
CAR APPROACHES

33:00.340 --> 33:01.970
I'm fishing.

33:02.020 --> 33:04.530
Saw it in a film.

33:04.580 --> 33:06.250
Doesn't work.

33:07.460 --> 33:08.810
You OK?

33:08.860 --> 33:10.420
SHE SCOFFS

33:16.060 --> 33:17.290
Mary!

33:17.340 --> 33:19.330
Visitor!

33:19.380 --> 33:21.770
My husband used to shout
at me. Now he's dead!

33:21.820 --> 33:24.450
Those two things might
not be connected, Jack,

33:24.500 --> 33:27.410
but are you sure you
want to take the risk?

33:27.460 --> 33:29.060
- Oh.
- Hi.

33:29.700 --> 33:31.700
Jack, make some tea.

33:33.500 --> 33:37.290
- What's happened? You look
upset. Where's Tom? - With Simon.

33:37.340 --> 33:39.690
- Did you tell her?
- No.

33:39.740 --> 33:41.890
What? What's going on?

33:41.940 --> 33:43.330
Can I stay?

33:43.380 --> 33:45.920
Well, I've got no clean towels.

33:46.380 --> 33:50.330
I'll find some. Course. You
can stay as long as you like.

33:50.380 --> 33:51.850
Sit down.

33:53.340 --> 33:54.940
PHONE RINGS

33:58.020 --> 34:01.650
- I thought you didn't have mobile reception.
- Oh, they put a mast up.

34:01.700 --> 34:04.700
I wrote a letter, it made no difference.

34:05.980 --> 34:07.850
He cheated on me.

34:07.900 --> 34:09.290
PHONE RINGS

34:09.340 --> 34:10.889
All right.

34:10.940 --> 34:12.810
Where's that tea?

34:18.020 --> 34:19.560
PHONE BEEPS

34:23.340 --> 34:25.530
- There.
- KEYPAD TONES

34:25.580 --> 34:27.320
Problem solved.

34:42.620 --> 34:43.929
Thanks...

34:43.980 --> 34:45.889
for taking Jack in.

34:45.940 --> 34:48.929
He's a pain in the neck,
but, like you said,

34:48.980 --> 34:50.969
he's useful round the house.

34:51.020 --> 34:54.620
- Sorry he's so rude. - It's the right
thing to do, so it must be done.

34:56.100 --> 34:58.730
He's stuck in the past,
that's been his problem.

34:58.780 --> 35:01.890
- He was with David a long time.
- I know.

35:01.940 --> 35:04.890
When you lose someone like that...

35:04.940 --> 35:06.770
when you're going through hell,

35:06.820 --> 35:08.810
you've got to keep going.

35:08.860 --> 35:10.050
Can I help?

35:10.100 --> 35:11.770
No, thank you.

35:11.820 --> 35:13.360
CLATTERING

35:14.580 --> 35:17.650
- Don't suppose you have any wine?
- What do you think(?)

35:17.700 --> 35:19.890
And Jack shouldn't so
don't you dare buy it.

35:19.940 --> 35:23.940
You can have another cup of
tea or there's some squash.

35:24.060 --> 35:26.850
- Was it advice you wanted?
Is that why you're here? - No.

35:26.900 --> 35:29.810
- You'd never be told before.
- I just needed to get away.

35:29.860 --> 35:31.200
I see.

35:33.780 --> 35:37.340
You'll want to get back for
Tom, soon, though, of course?

35:38.940 --> 35:41.540
You'll want to get back for him.

35:43.180 --> 35:45.650
I might just... get some air.

35:48.260 --> 35:50.260
Dinner's 20 minutes.

36:37.100 --> 36:39.610
You're addicted to those things.

36:39.660 --> 36:42.760
Same as David, he was never off his iPad.

36:54.500 --> 36:57.500
- How did you get these?
- His assistant.

37:05.580 --> 37:07.930
You grew up around here.

37:07.980 --> 37:09.250
Yeah.

37:10.620 --> 37:12.850
Mary helped us out.

37:12.900 --> 37:15.170
Picked me up from school.

37:15.780 --> 37:18.980
When my mum and dad
died, she was all I had.

37:19.700 --> 37:23.370
What happened to your
parents? She wouldn't say.

37:23.420 --> 37:25.970
Car accident. When I was 16.

37:26.020 --> 37:29.120
I stayed with Mary for a year, but she...

37:30.940 --> 37:36.250
I was bored of people feeling
sorry for me, so I went to London.

37:36.300 --> 37:39.100
A levels, medical school, met Simon.

37:39.820 --> 37:41.160
Moved.

37:41.980 --> 37:43.920
Started a new life.

37:44.940 --> 37:47.680
Had a child, then we got the house.

37:50.180 --> 37:51.660
SHE SIGHS

37:52.820 --> 37:54.760
I love that house.

38:00.660 --> 38:03.200
How's this working out for you?

38:03.260 --> 38:05.570
Well, off the booze,

38:05.620 --> 38:07.450
health's improved,

38:07.500 --> 38:10.500
and she's got someone to do the gardening.

38:12.340 --> 38:15.840
- So, you'll stay a bit
longer, then? - Forever.

38:16.100 --> 38:17.970
But not with her.

38:18.980 --> 38:20.690
Moving on, Gemma.

38:20.740 --> 38:22.680
I can recommend it.

38:24.860 --> 38:27.410
Get Tom on a train up here.

38:27.460 --> 38:30.330
- You don't need to stay in that place.
- Why should Simon win?

38:30.380 --> 38:32.580
Who cares about winning?

38:33.100 --> 38:34.700
Be happy.

38:39.700 --> 38:42.090
I understand all that

38:42.140 --> 38:44.330
but you made a commitment.

38:44.380 --> 38:46.130
She can't stay there.

38:46.180 --> 38:48.050
- Come on!
- Better or worse!

38:48.100 --> 38:50.330
Rubbish! You need to leave.

38:50.380 --> 38:52.530
But it's my town. I've got friends.

38:52.580 --> 38:55.690
It's Simon's town, and if
you're talking about friends,

38:55.740 --> 38:57.450
you could do a lot better.

38:57.500 --> 39:01.090
- It's not fair.
- "Fair"! Gemma, not to be mean,

39:01.140 --> 39:02.450
but that's the sort of thing

39:02.500 --> 39:05.410
you were saying when you were
a little girl. Life isn't fair.

39:05.460 --> 39:06.890
It's how you deal with it.

39:06.940 --> 39:09.090
I was thinking in the car...

39:09.140 --> 39:10.570
what if I never came back?

39:10.620 --> 39:12.820
Women do that sometimes.

39:13.540 --> 39:18.010
Tom would be upset, but
he'd have his dad, friends.

39:18.060 --> 39:20.050
Maybe it'd all work out.

39:20.100 --> 39:22.170
Who would actually miss me...

39:22.220 --> 39:24.410
if I...

39:24.460 --> 39:25.530
vanished?

39:25.580 --> 39:27.450
You shouldn't say things like that.

39:27.500 --> 39:30.700
- You know what it's like
to lose a parent. - I coped.

39:31.860 --> 39:33.090
And he would too.

39:33.140 --> 39:35.370
What do you mean, "vanish"?

39:35.420 --> 39:37.490
You thought about it.

39:38.140 --> 39:39.740
Those pills.

39:40.700 --> 39:44.100
The one person in my life
that ever loved me...

39:44.180 --> 39:45.410
.. had gone forever.

39:45.460 --> 39:48.250
- It's completely different.
- I agree.

39:48.300 --> 39:49.610
Right.

39:49.660 --> 39:52.490
- What's happened to me is worse.
- Now, you're being ridiculous!

39:52.540 --> 39:56.220
David died in pain, coughing
up liquid... desperate.

39:57.300 --> 39:58.610
There was nothing I could do...

39:58.660 --> 40:01.690
- At least the time you had together was real.
- You can't compare the two!

40:01.740 --> 40:04.610
It isn't like Simon's just
gone. He never existed.

40:04.660 --> 40:07.370
Every moment that we spent together
was false, because he was never

40:07.420 --> 40:09.770
- the person that I thought he was.
- Gemma, he's made a mistake,

40:09.820 --> 40:12.050
that doesn't mean he's a
completely different person.

40:12.100 --> 40:13.690
And my parents died, also in pain,

40:13.740 --> 40:16.130
and I don't know exactly
what happened in the crash,

40:16.180 --> 40:18.570
but I bet it wasn't instant
like everyone said.

40:18.620 --> 40:22.210
So, I... know what it's
like to be left behind.

40:22.260 --> 40:23.800
But I'm...

40:24.500 --> 40:26.610
.. really sorry, Jack,

40:26.660 --> 40:29.000
I loved David, too, but...

40:29.740 --> 40:33.450
.. what's happened to me is
so much harder to deal with,

40:33.500 --> 40:35.240
I promise you.

40:38.900 --> 40:40.770
I'm going to bed.

40:43.460 --> 40:46.610
You need to be careful when you're upset.

40:46.660 --> 40:49.200
- You've always known.
- What?

40:50.260 --> 40:52.600
Exactly how to hurt people.

40:57.220 --> 40:58.560
(Yeah.)

41:01.780 --> 41:04.300

43:31.340 --> 43:32.880
In a hotel.

43:33.860 --> 43:36.650
The conference. Didn't Becky say?

43:36.700 --> 43:39.010
'But you just... left.
I've been trying to call.'

43:39.060 --> 43:40.810
I'll be back in a couple of days.

43:40.860 --> 43:42.490
'You just forgot about it?'

43:42.540 --> 43:45.010
Things have been difficult...

43:46.260 --> 43:49.170
.. recently, so, yeah, I forgot.

43:49.220 --> 43:51.570
'You asked about that text.
I thought you might've...'

43:51.620 --> 43:54.380
- What?
- '.. been upset.'

43:56.380 --> 43:59.490
- How are you?
- 'I couldn't sleep. I was worried.'

43:59.540 --> 44:00.890
Any news?

44:00.940 --> 44:02.540
'What news?'

44:04.220 --> 44:06.690
Anything you want to tell me?

44:08.580 --> 44:09.850
'No.'

44:12.380 --> 44:14.090
'OK. Well... look...

44:14.140 --> 44:16.410
'I'll call you tomorrow?'

44:21.100 --> 44:22.410
- Bye, then.
- 'Bye.'

(Shit!)

47:00.580 --> 47:01.980
Gemma!

47:18.420 --> 47:20.170
What are you doing?

47:20.220 --> 47:21.650
It's freezing!

47:21.700 --> 47:23.640
I wanted to drown.

47:24.620 --> 47:26.330
I told you, that's...

47:26.380 --> 47:27.570
not...

47:27.620 --> 47:29.690
But then I thought...

47:30.740 --> 47:32.410
No.

47:32.460 --> 47:34.330
What do you mean?

47:39.860 --> 47:43.300
Best put this on before
you get hypothermia.

47:44.700 --> 47:46.450
Gemma, stop.

47:46.500 --> 47:47.530
Wait!

47:47.580 --> 47:49.580

Simon asked me to pick up Tom.

48:44.180 --> 48:45.450
I need your help.

48:45.500 --> 48:47.770
What do you mean?

48:47.820 --> 48:49.690
You owe it to me.

48:55.620 --> 48:57.220
You're back.

RATTLING

49:32.260 --> 49:35.650
Hey! I saw your car. You said two days.

49:35.700 --> 49:38.980
I changed my mind. I
didn't want to be away.

49:42.380 --> 49:46.080
I'm all over the place at
the moment. Can you tell?

49:46.660 --> 49:48.170
That's why I was worried.

49:48.220 --> 49:49.850
Are you ready?

49:49.900 --> 49:51.490
- What for?
- Dinner.

49:51.540 --> 49:53.770
We're due at half seven.

49:53.820 --> 49:55.530
What? Who with?

49:55.580 --> 49:57.720
Go and get a shirt on.

50:01.380 --> 50:03.650
It's mad living with you sometimes!

50:03.700 --> 50:05.240
SHE LAUGHS

50:17.380 --> 50:19.170
What about Tom, who's...?

50:19.220 --> 50:21.530
- Becky's looking after Tom tonight.
- Gemma called,

50:21.580 --> 50:24.130
said she was coming back, and
wanted to keep this dinner,

50:24.180 --> 50:27.700
but the short notice meant she
didn't have childcare, so I offered.

50:31.700 --> 50:33.040
Thanks.

50:48.700 --> 50:51.900
You really won't tell
me where we're going?

50:52.500 --> 50:55.040
You used to be into surprises.

50:55.780 --> 50:57.050
Fine.

50:59.540 --> 51:01.170
Do I like these people?

51:01.220 --> 51:02.960
You love them.

51:17.420 --> 51:19.370
It's the Parks.

51:19.420 --> 51:21.890
They invited us yesterday.

51:21.940 --> 51:23.740
At the football?

51:24.460 --> 51:25.860
Gemma...

51:27.900 --> 51:29.050
I can't.

Hi!

- What?
- Gemma...

52:05.700 --> 52:10.250
Oh, God. What's going on?
You're not expecting us...

52:10.300 --> 52:13.410
Hello, Fosters!

52:13.460 --> 52:16.490
- What's this? You're...?
- I think you're a week early.

52:16.540 --> 52:18.170
Really? But this is the...?

52:18.220 --> 52:22.810
- I thought... You said "Thursday"
in your e-mail... - I meant next week.

52:22.860 --> 52:25.410
Oh, I'm so sorry... it's my mistake!

52:25.460 --> 52:26.610
Oh!

52:26.660 --> 52:28.850
- Ah... Come in anyway!
- No, it's fine.

52:28.900 --> 52:31.890
- We'll head back, we're tired
actually... - No! Nonsense!

52:31.940 --> 52:34.930
We can rustle something
up. You're here now.

52:34.980 --> 52:37.610
- That'll be all right, won't
it, Susie? - Absolutely.

52:37.660 --> 52:40.050
For these two, we will make
it work, come on! Come in!

52:40.100 --> 52:42.810
- Are you sure? - Positive.
- (Honestly, I think we should go.)

52:42.860 --> 52:45.930
We've got the kids in tonight
so there'll be plenty of food,

52:45.980 --> 52:47.890
it'll be fun!

52:47.940 --> 52:50.690
- I'm really not... - Come
on! - God, it's gorgeous.

- The house?
- Does it have a name?

54:06.060 --> 54:07.370
We'll talk.

54:07.420 --> 54:09.570
Gemma, help yourself.

54:09.620 --> 54:11.740
How's your love life?

54:12.740 --> 54:14.570
There's been a complaint made against me.

54:14.620 --> 54:16.330
- What's the complaint?
- Chris!

54:16.380 --> 54:19.290
A man says I threatened to
burn him with a lit cigarette
