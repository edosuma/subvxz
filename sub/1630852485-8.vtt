WEBVTT

01:49.168 --> 01:50.359
(baby crying)

01:53.839 --> 01:55.364
(caller shushing)

02:04.032 --> 02:06.708
(theme music playing)

02:07.962 --> 02:09.294
(siren wailing)

02:09.446 --> 02:11.797
MAN:
Come on, man. You know me.
I'm good for it.

02:11.948 --> 02:13.465
Come on, man, I'm good for it!

02:21.142 --> 02:23.559
Lady, you sure this is
where you wanna be?

02:25.295 --> 02:26.645
I'm pretty sure it's not.

02:34.563 --> 02:37.531
(intense music playing)

02:47.075 --> 02:49.459
(man groaning)

03:06.020 --> 03:07.728
(siren wailing in distance)

03:10.098 --> 03:11.273
(lighter flicks)

03:20.367 --> 03:21.450
TK.

03:22.018 --> 03:23.160
TK.

03:25.689 --> 03:26.580
TK!

03:27.190 --> 03:27.873
TK.

03:28.024 --> 03:29.449
TK (weakly): Leave me alone.

03:29.543 --> 03:30.709
(TK groans)

03:32.454 --> 03:34.771
-GWYN: Oh, God.
-TK: Leave me alone.

03:34.773 --> 03:35.697
GWYN: Hey.

03:36.217 --> 03:37.716
Come on, let's get up.

03:37.793 --> 03:38.959
-Come on.
-TK: Mom?

03:39.127 --> 03:40.368
GWYN: Come on, get up.

03:40.462 --> 03:41.511
(groaning)

03:42.130 --> 03:43.280
How'd you find me?

03:43.298 --> 03:46.058
I am your mother.
I will always find you.

03:46.285 --> 03:47.467
-Should you be here?
-No!

03:47.561 --> 03:49.228
And neither should you.
Let's go home.

03:49.379 --> 03:51.379
-Come on, let's go.
-I can't, Mom.

03:51.398 --> 03:53.398
Yes, you can.
Come on, get up.

03:54.476 --> 03:56.626
-Is Dad with you?
-No, I came alone.

03:56.795 --> 03:58.052
Come on, let's go.

03:58.072 --> 03:59.646
TK: No, no, no, it's fine.

03:59.798 --> 04:01.240
It's fine.

04:01.391 --> 04:02.282
GWYN: TK.

04:04.245 --> 04:05.285
TK!

04:06.247 --> 04:07.246
TK!

04:10.642 --> 04:11.975
OWEN (echoing): TK?

04:11.994 --> 04:13.210
TK?

04:15.647 --> 04:16.630
TK?

04:20.669 --> 04:21.718
Do you have a preference?

04:23.155 --> 04:24.429
I guess it doesn't
really matter.

04:24.656 --> 04:26.640
At a certain point,
black is black.

04:29.344 --> 04:33.272
CARLOS:
Okay, I can get three seats
at a 9:30 flight,

04:33.423 --> 04:35.440
but the 11:00 a.m. flight
is a little bit cheaper.

04:35.592 --> 04:36.516
The 9:30.

04:36.668 --> 04:37.943
We have to be
at the funeral home

04:38.094 --> 04:39.169
by 3:00 New York time.

04:39.187 --> 04:40.279
I don't wanna
cut it that close.

04:40.506 --> 04:42.030
-CARLOS: Yeah.
-Do you think he'll remember?

04:44.618 --> 04:45.933
Jonah watched his mom die.

04:46.028 --> 04:47.327
Do you think he'll remember it?

04:50.273 --> 04:52.440
Uh, he's not even
a year old, son.

04:52.534 --> 04:54.684
I don't think you can
remember things that early.

04:54.703 --> 04:55.669
I did.

04:58.299 --> 05:01.258
I remember the wallpaper
in the 86th Street apartment.

05:02.544 --> 05:03.719
Purple flowers.

05:05.472 --> 05:08.598
I remember the elephants
on the mobile above my crib.

05:10.218 --> 05:12.269
I remember the songs
Mom sang me.

05:14.297 --> 05:16.039
Not... Not the words.

05:16.058 --> 05:17.357
I can't...

05:18.560 --> 05:20.210
I can't really
remember the words,

05:20.228 --> 05:22.362
but I, I, I know she sang to me.

05:24.825 --> 05:27.159
God, he's gonna be
so traumatized.

05:29.479 --> 05:30.620
Dad, if he saw...

05:34.076 --> 05:35.417
OWEN: TK...

05:36.578 --> 05:37.711
he's gonna be okay.

05:39.006 --> 05:40.397
Okay? TK, I promise.

05:40.490 --> 05:42.424
Who's gonna take him
to dim sum?

05:43.493 --> 05:45.402
You. Enzo.

05:45.495 --> 05:47.921
No, Enzo doesn't know
the place on Spring Street.

05:48.073 --> 05:49.089
It's a hole in the wall.

05:49.183 --> 05:50.998
He's gonna take him
somewhere fancy.

05:51.018 --> 05:53.167
Babe, you can take him
to your place.

05:53.745 --> 05:55.270
Everything's broken now.

05:57.173 --> 05:58.648
Will he even know
how broken it is?

06:01.253 --> 06:03.153
He'll never know the time
when it wasn't.

06:04.272 --> 06:05.989
He'll never know Mom.

06:10.037 --> 06:11.328
Yes, he will.

06:13.356 --> 06:15.749
He'll know her through you
as a big brother.

06:17.211 --> 06:18.543
You'll tell him about Mom.

06:20.196 --> 06:21.421
The songs she sang.

06:23.792 --> 06:25.342
He'll know her
through you.

06:27.295 --> 06:29.112
Okay, I need to pack, right?

06:29.172 --> 06:30.463
No, no, you don't.

06:30.616 --> 06:31.598
It's all taken care of.

06:32.375 --> 06:33.258
Alright?

06:33.969 --> 06:35.376
I have to go
to the cleaners.

06:35.396 --> 06:37.137
I'll swing back
and pick you guys up, okay?

06:37.289 --> 06:38.522
-Yeah, we'll be ready.
-Alright.

06:40.884 --> 06:42.216
I'm so sorry, Carlos.

06:43.311 --> 06:46.554
It's your first time
to New York and it's like this.

06:47.466 --> 06:51.484
TK, do not even
think about that.

06:52.304 --> 06:53.703
I wish things were different.

06:54.656 --> 06:56.331
Hey, look at me.

06:57.659 --> 06:59.334
There will be other trips.

07:05.092 --> 07:06.508
I'm gonna go grab us some food.

07:07.577 --> 07:08.818
I'm not really hungry.

07:08.912 --> 07:09.911
CARLOS: I know.

07:10.005 --> 07:11.680
I know,
but you should eat something.

07:12.766 --> 07:14.224
I'll figure it out.

07:16.828 --> 07:17.686
I love you.

07:18.847 --> 07:19.688
(quietly): Love you.

07:21.683 --> 07:23.650
(somber music playing)

07:30.025 --> 07:31.616
(keys jingling)

07:31.768 --> 07:32.701
(door opens)

07:36.531 --> 07:37.747
(door closes)

07:40.294 --> 07:43.036
I'm just saying,
those delivery bikes
are dangerous.

07:43.130 --> 07:44.129
Not usually.

07:44.280 --> 07:45.279
MATEO: Zipping in
and out of traffic.

07:45.299 --> 07:46.715
You can't hear 'em coming.

07:47.709 --> 07:49.025
You think she saw that?

07:49.044 --> 07:49.968
Well...

07:50.471 --> 07:52.637
She managed to push the baby
out of the way, so, yeah.

07:52.864 --> 07:54.698
(sighs deeply)
It's awful.

07:55.309 --> 07:57.867
I know. I called my mom
as soon as I got home.

07:57.886 --> 07:59.035
I should call mine too.

07:59.128 --> 08:00.370
Hey, should we send flowers
or something?

08:00.539 --> 08:02.038
JUDD:
No, that's all taken care of.

08:02.057 --> 08:03.373
Grace ordered an arrangement.

08:03.466 --> 08:04.966
It's gonna have
everybody's name on it.

08:04.985 --> 08:06.392
It'll be there when they
get to the funeral home.

08:06.487 --> 08:09.136
-Just let us know
how much we owe you.
-Yeah, I will.

08:09.231 --> 08:10.989
MATEO: Hey, do you guys think
this is happening kinda fast?

08:11.140 --> 08:12.473
I mean, it seems quick, right?

08:12.993 --> 08:14.141
When my grandma died,

08:14.236 --> 08:15.494
there was like
a week in between.

08:15.687 --> 08:16.644
It's Jewish law.

08:16.663 --> 08:17.979
Or tradition, actually.

08:17.998 --> 08:19.498
Burial has to happen
within 24 hours.

08:20.575 --> 08:22.408
Maybe it is better
just to get it over with.

08:22.503 --> 08:23.484
PAUL: Hmm.

08:23.820 --> 08:24.669
TK: Hey, guys.

08:29.693 --> 08:30.842
Hey, TK.

08:31.903 --> 08:34.513
Shouldn't you, uh, be
on a plane right about now?

08:36.183 --> 08:37.474
Yeah, I'm not going.

08:41.688 --> 08:43.563
-You're not?
-Nope.

08:47.194 --> 08:49.694
(indistinct announcement
over PA)

08:50.847 --> 08:51.738
Hey, Nance.

08:53.759 --> 08:54.741
Hey.

08:55.777 --> 08:57.536
MAN:
Here. I'll bring it up.

08:58.855 --> 09:00.413
WOMAN:
That's good.

09:11.200 --> 09:13.760
(tense music playing)

09:19.134 --> 09:20.308
(keypad beeps)

09:33.298 --> 09:34.614
-OWEN: Hey.
-Yeah?

09:35.576 --> 09:36.700
Son, what are you doing?

09:45.085 --> 09:46.334
GWYN: You should eat.

09:47.087 --> 09:48.402
TK: I'm not really hungry.

09:48.496 --> 09:51.339
Yes, you are.
You just don't know it.

09:52.575 --> 09:53.592
(groans weakly)

10:01.326 --> 10:02.976
Swallow.

10:04.179 --> 10:05.687
I'm not a damn baby, Mom.

10:06.514 --> 10:08.255
GWYN: No, you're not.

10:09.167 --> 10:10.758
Because when a baby reaches
for something sharp,

10:10.777 --> 10:12.001
it doesn't know the danger.

10:12.170 --> 10:14.762
You know the danger
and you're still reaching,

10:14.781 --> 10:17.657
you're still sticking
that sharp thing into you.

10:19.602 --> 10:20.677
You've lost control, TK.

10:20.695 --> 10:22.178
We're getting you help.

10:22.197 --> 10:23.446
I don't need help. It's...

10:24.625 --> 10:26.516
It's not like that, alright?
I'm-I'm managing.

10:26.534 --> 10:28.384
Is that what
you were doing yesterday

10:28.386 --> 10:29.686
in that place, managing it?

10:29.704 --> 10:31.004
You don't...

10:31.690 --> 10:32.522
Ask Dad.

10:33.208 --> 10:34.966
Ask him how many shifts
I've missed.

10:35.193 --> 10:37.360
Ask all the other guys
if I've missed one shift

10:37.529 --> 10:39.712
or if I've shown up
late or, or dirty

10:39.806 --> 10:41.306
'cause, no, I have not.

10:45.479 --> 10:46.978
Are you addicted
to the needle prick yet?

10:47.130 --> 10:49.555
Oh, my God.
Mom, why--

10:49.650 --> 10:51.632
GWYN: I read about it.
Needle fixation.

10:51.726 --> 10:53.209
The ritual of the pain.

10:53.378 --> 10:55.195
Why are we even
talking about this?

10:56.047 --> 10:57.063
You gonna eat that?

10:57.157 --> 10:59.140
-No, I'm gonna puke.
-Then puke.

10:59.234 --> 11:01.493
But just get it all out because
we have a flight to catch.

11:02.737 --> 11:04.162
What?

11:05.332 --> 11:06.665
Our plane leaves in two hours.

11:08.151 --> 11:10.243
-What are you talking about?
-I'm taking you to rehab.

11:10.337 --> 11:12.170
-Rehab?
-GWYN: There's a place
in California

11:12.321 --> 11:14.080
that is supposed
to be the best.

11:14.157 --> 11:15.732
C... Califor...
Mom, I have work.

11:15.825 --> 11:18.251
No, you don't.
Not for 30 days.

11:18.403 --> 11:20.011
No. I am...
I am not doing that, Mom.

11:20.163 --> 11:22.088
Do what you want.
You have six hours to decide.

11:22.240 --> 11:23.923
-No.
-Because we are
getting on that plane!

11:24.000 --> 11:25.241
-No!
-(pounds on table)

11:25.260 --> 11:26.685
(cutlery clatters)

11:35.195 --> 11:36.695
I have to stay here, Mom.

11:38.773 --> 11:40.281
They need me.

11:42.185 --> 11:44.277
Listen... Look at me,
I'm-I'm fine.

11:45.372 --> 11:48.415
I'm a firefighter, Mom, alright?
I save lives.

11:52.771 --> 11:55.463
That is what
I am trying to do.

12:02.130 --> 12:04.347
(horns honking)

12:06.801 --> 12:07.892
It should open up in a minute.

12:08.119 --> 12:10.586
It always kinda
clogs up here.

12:11.456 --> 12:13.214
Alright, so Carlos
is checking us in

12:13.233 --> 12:14.474
and we only have one bag
to worry about,

12:14.609 --> 12:16.476
so we just gotta
get through security,

12:16.628 --> 12:17.643
we should be fine.

12:17.720 --> 12:19.479
(honking continues)

12:20.482 --> 12:22.657
We will be fine getting
through security, right?

12:24.152 --> 12:25.452
You wanna frisk me first?

12:26.395 --> 12:27.320
Do I need to?

12:28.081 --> 12:29.489
I was just doing inventory, Dad.

12:29.657 --> 12:32.167
I already told you that.
You can believe me or not.

12:34.996 --> 12:36.337
Why were you even there, TK?

12:37.332 --> 12:39.215
You knew you had
a flight to catch.

12:40.576 --> 12:41.593
I don't know. I...

12:43.488 --> 12:45.096
I just thought
it'd be a good idea.

12:46.415 --> 12:48.391
Just wanted the day
to be normal, but it's...

12:49.085 --> 12:50.226
it's not.

12:52.163 --> 12:53.354
No, it's not.

12:55.166 --> 12:56.332
I don't wanna do this, Dad.

12:56.425 --> 12:58.259
-I don't wanna go.
-TK.

12:58.278 --> 13:00.670
It's not even like it's gonna
be Mom in that box anyway.

13:00.688 --> 13:03.006
-That-that's not where
she is right now.
-Son.

13:03.099 --> 13:05.266
Dad, I swear to God,
I'm gonna crawl out of my skin.

13:05.285 --> 13:07.268
No, you're not.
You're gonna get through this.

13:07.345 --> 13:09.012
I don't wanna do it
any more than you do.

13:09.030 --> 13:11.331
But it's life,
it's what people do.
They go to funerals.

13:12.066 --> 13:13.107
It never seems fair.

13:13.685 --> 13:16.211
It's not just another funeral.
It's Mom's.

13:17.798 --> 13:20.298
You may not have
loved her anymore,
but I still do.

13:24.805 --> 13:26.262
I loved your mother.

13:27.866 --> 13:29.265
I always did.

13:31.794 --> 13:33.978
Even when things
got complicated.

13:36.299 --> 13:37.464
Never thought I'd be...

13:38.485 --> 13:40.527
rushing to catch a flight
to go back and...

13:42.063 --> 13:43.404
(exhales)

13:45.308 --> 13:46.407
I loved your mother.

13:48.720 --> 13:50.144
(horns honking)

13:50.163 --> 13:51.329
Come on. We can still make it.

13:52.332 --> 13:54.315
-CARLOS: You didn't make it.
-We didn't?

13:54.334 --> 13:55.983
You didn't,
but you're going to.

13:56.077 --> 13:58.227
Two tickets for the flight
leaving in 25 minutes.

13:58.229 --> 13:59.320
It's coach, but should
get you there in time.

13:59.339 --> 14:00.746
I thought the last flight
was at 11:00.

14:00.823 --> 14:03.007
I was looking for three seats.
This one only had two.

14:03.159 --> 14:04.008
What about you?

14:04.235 --> 14:05.826
I'll take the later one.

14:05.846 --> 14:06.994
You guys need to be there.

14:07.013 --> 14:08.513
Thank you, Carlos.
You're saving the day.

14:08.740 --> 14:09.639
Yeah.

14:12.018 --> 14:13.726
You weren't home
when I got back.

14:15.263 --> 14:17.597
I went to the firehouse.
I don't even know why.

14:18.692 --> 14:21.192
TK, it's fine. I was just...
I was just worried about you.

14:22.270 --> 14:24.195
I hate that I can't make
everything okay.

14:29.260 --> 14:31.277
Alright, go.
I'll-I'll see you in New York.

14:31.429 --> 14:32.328
Okay.

14:40.529 --> 14:42.696
FLIGHT ATTENDANT:
<i> Welcome aboard. Hi.</i>

14:42.716 --> 14:43.697
<i> Welcome.</i>

14:43.717 --> 14:44.941
GWYN: It's right here, honey.

14:45.368 --> 14:47.201
Do you want to sit
in the window or the aisle?

14:47.295 --> 14:49.112
I don't care. I feel sick.

14:49.130 --> 14:50.305
Then the aisle.

14:53.468 --> 14:55.468
(exhaling, wincing)

14:56.212 --> 14:58.287
(flight attendant continues,
indistinct)

14:58.381 --> 14:59.898
Everybody's
looking at me, Mom.

15:00.066 --> 15:02.216
It's the curse of
the Strand men.

15:02.235 --> 15:04.235
I don't think it's for
the cheekbones this time.

15:05.313 --> 15:07.130
You should have
let me stop on the way.

15:07.223 --> 15:08.239
Get enough just for the flight.

15:08.391 --> 15:09.649
That's the chemicals talking.

15:09.743 --> 15:11.651
No, it's the chemicals
screaming.

15:11.819 --> 15:13.328
(labored breathing)

15:13.896 --> 15:15.330
(exhales)

15:16.491 --> 15:17.498
(clinking)

15:18.752 --> 15:19.626
(dings)

15:21.570 --> 15:22.569
(thuds)

15:22.756 --> 15:24.647
(baby crying)

15:25.150 --> 15:26.382
(indistinct chatter)

15:32.657 --> 15:35.683
(Gwyn singing in Hebrew)

15:41.257 --> 15:42.440
You remember that?

15:43.109 --> 15:44.609
I used to sing that to you
when you were a baby.

15:44.760 --> 15:46.018
What is it?

15:46.446 --> 15:49.447
It's a prayer for the soul,
the<i> neshama.</i>

15:50.266 --> 15:54.010
It's about how much damage

15:54.028 --> 15:55.528
we try to inflict on ourselves.

15:56.289 --> 15:58.531
And yet the<i> neshama</i>
remains untouched.

15:59.200 --> 16:01.200
Does the Torah say anything
about being dope sick?

16:01.294 --> 16:04.253
Because I think my<i> neshama</i>
bailed back in Queens.

16:06.708 --> 16:08.174
No, sweetheart, it doesn't.

16:09.360 --> 16:11.360
Mom, I'm not gonna
make it to California.

16:11.972 --> 16:14.030
-You couldn't find
something upstate?
-Hm.

16:14.123 --> 16:16.307
ATTENDANT:
Seat belt? Great.

16:16.459 --> 16:18.217
Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you

16:18.369 --> 16:20.203
-to fasten your
seat belt before takeoff.
-Yeah.

16:20.296 --> 16:22.397
-ATTENDANT: Thank you.
-Sh, sh, sh...

16:30.323 --> 16:32.365
-Do you want the aisle?
-I don't care.

16:35.662 --> 16:38.054
WOMAN: No, I'm not making fun.

16:38.072 --> 16:40.072
Remember, the doctor said
it's gonna take some time

16:40.166 --> 16:41.541
to get your strength back.

16:42.502 --> 16:44.168
You sure you're
gonna be alright?

16:44.337 --> 16:46.912
My sister said
she'd be happy to stop by.

16:47.065 --> 16:49.549
Okay, okay, forget I said it.

16:50.343 --> 16:51.718
I'll call you when we land.

16:53.087 --> 16:54.429
I love you, too.

16:57.666 --> 16:58.516
My husband.

16:59.260 --> 17:01.352
He had a stroke
a few months ago.

17:01.387 --> 17:03.003
It's my first time
leaving him.

17:03.023 --> 17:04.022
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

17:04.582 --> 17:05.506
Appreciate that.

17:05.600 --> 17:08.100
They expect him
to have a full recovery.

17:08.194 --> 17:10.436
Thank God I was home.
I called 9-1-1.

17:10.588 --> 17:12.346
They had him in surgery
in an hour.

17:13.107 --> 17:15.182
Golden hour.
It's a real thing.

17:15.201 --> 17:17.017
Oh, you're in the medical field?

17:17.037 --> 17:18.594
We're first responders.

17:18.763 --> 17:19.704
I'm Owen, I'm a firefighter.

17:19.931 --> 17:22.098
This is my son TK,
he's a paramedic.

17:22.116 --> 17:24.375
Genevieve,
formerly a retired CPA.

17:24.602 --> 17:25.768
Oh, yeah?
What are you doing now?

17:25.861 --> 17:28.437
Still a CPA,
just no longer retired.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.698
Never thought I'd be doing
another field audit again,

17:31.718 --> 17:33.776
but with my husband's bills,

17:33.795 --> 17:37.613
well, life keeps you
on your toes, doesn't it?

17:37.632 --> 17:39.307
It certainly does.

17:40.376 --> 17:42.376
So what takes you boys
to New York?

17:42.470 --> 17:43.544
My mom.

17:43.563 --> 17:45.546
Oh, that's lovely.

17:46.066 --> 17:48.215
She's sure gonna be
happy to see you.

17:49.294 --> 17:52.236
Our first moved to Atlanta
three years ago.

17:52.388 --> 17:55.198
Every time she comes home,
it's a joy.

17:57.135 --> 17:58.692
Hey, miss?
(snapping fingers)

17:58.803 --> 17:59.911
Hey, stewardess?

18:00.062 --> 18:01.562
Can I get a vodka tonic?

18:01.730 --> 18:03.063
I'm sorry, but beverage service

18:03.157 --> 18:04.490
will be available
once we're in the air.

18:04.584 --> 18:06.492
What? Come on, I get them
in first class all the time.

18:06.644 --> 18:07.734
ATTENDANT: Sir, please.

18:07.903 --> 18:09.754
Seriously, though,
I need a drink for takeoff.

18:09.905 --> 18:11.905
ATTENDANT:
I'm gonna need you to lower
your voice and calm down.

18:11.925 --> 18:13.332
PASSENGER:
Don't tell me to calm down.
I have anxiety.

18:13.484 --> 18:16.319
Yo! You heard the lady.
Calm down and shut your mouth.

18:16.412 --> 18:18.412
Sir, please stay out of this,
we don't need you
to escalate things.

18:18.431 --> 18:20.247
I'm sorry. He's had
a little bit of a tough day.

18:20.266 --> 18:21.582
He's not gonna be a problem.

18:21.676 --> 18:23.601
That guy's being
a total dick.

18:23.752 --> 18:24.994
Yeah, he is.

18:25.012 --> 18:26.270
But when they come and
yank him off the plane,

18:26.422 --> 18:28.255
I don't want them
yanking you off too.

18:28.608 --> 18:30.191
Speak for yourself.

18:33.855 --> 18:35.363
(dings)

18:51.873 --> 18:54.206
ATTENDANT 1:
You always imagine
the layovers in Paris.

18:54.359 --> 18:56.192
Not quite so glamorous
in Bozeman.

18:56.210 --> 18:57.135
-How's the book?
-ATTENDANT 2: It's terrible.

18:57.286 --> 18:58.544
Super trashy. Can't put it down.

18:58.696 --> 19:00.162
Hey, anything to get you

19:00.164 --> 19:01.622
through Iowa and Nebraska.

19:01.641 --> 19:03.349
(lock clicks)

19:09.724 --> 19:10.982
Cap, you have a second?

19:11.876 --> 19:12.984
What's going on?

19:13.878 --> 19:15.987
The last thing I wanna do is
come in here pointing fingers.

19:16.990 --> 19:19.407
Pointing fingers?
At whom?

19:22.311 --> 19:23.327
TK.

19:23.997 --> 19:25.388
And I'm sick over it,

19:25.556 --> 19:28.166
because I know how hard
he has worked on his sobriety.

19:28.743 --> 19:30.910
I mean we were at the party
when he got his chip.

19:31.412 --> 19:34.730
So the last thing in the world
I wanna suggest

19:34.732 --> 19:36.465
is that he might have slipped.

19:37.068 --> 19:38.401
Okay. Tell me.

19:38.419 --> 19:40.920
I thought it was weird
he came in today at all.

19:41.014 --> 19:42.996
You know,
with everything going on.

19:43.516 --> 19:46.742
Then he made
a beeline to the bus,

19:46.761 --> 19:48.093
like he was on a mission.

19:48.246 --> 19:50.354
-And?
-I went in there after he left.

19:51.191 --> 19:52.982
He was in
the narcotics safe, Cap.

19:54.527 --> 19:55.676
How can you be sure?

19:55.770 --> 19:57.195
He left the pouch open.

19:57.846 --> 19:59.530
I know because
I just restocked it.

20:00.258 --> 20:02.015
Okay. Well, was there
anything missing?

20:02.093 --> 20:02.724
No.

20:03.428 --> 20:04.777
At least not by my count.

20:04.871 --> 20:06.095
TOMMY:
That's good. That's good.

20:06.113 --> 20:07.371
We'll give him
the benefit of the doubt.

20:07.540 --> 20:08.539
Right?

20:09.267 --> 20:11.250
Totally. He deserves that.

20:12.803 --> 20:14.528
Okay. I'm sure it was nothing.

20:14.622 --> 20:17.548
And we'll do a full inventory
of the supply cabinet

20:17.700 --> 20:19.217
just to be sure.

20:21.295 --> 20:22.345
Thanks.

20:25.616 --> 20:26.515
(dings)

20:31.122 --> 20:32.396
I gotta hit the head, Dad.

20:33.382 --> 20:34.482
Okay.

20:43.225 --> 20:44.967
Sorry about my son earlier.

20:45.303 --> 20:48.537
He's usually a little...
friendlier.

20:49.657 --> 20:51.415
He's friendly enough.

20:51.642 --> 20:53.158
And he wasn't wrong.

20:53.311 --> 20:54.660
That guy was being a dick.

20:54.737 --> 20:56.587
Oh, total dick.

20:58.649 --> 21:01.425
So I take it,
this isn't a happy trip?

21:02.670 --> 21:03.928
No, it's not.

21:04.413 --> 21:06.931
My ex-wife,
his-his mother passed away,

21:07.158 --> 21:08.991
and we're on the way
to the funeral.

21:09.010 --> 21:09.600
Oh.

21:10.270 --> 21:12.344
That's terrible. I'm so sorry.

21:12.497 --> 21:14.522
-My condolences.
-Thank you.

21:15.500 --> 21:17.182
Was it expected?

21:17.335 --> 21:20.444
No, it was...
certainly not expected.

21:22.097 --> 21:24.156
I don't think it's sunk in
for either one of us yet.

21:24.600 --> 21:25.491
Hmm.

21:26.393 --> 21:29.161
Life is relentless, isn't it?

21:30.123 --> 21:31.539
It sure the hell is.

21:32.775 --> 21:34.333
You'd think I'd be used to it.

21:35.962 --> 21:37.044
(sighs)

21:37.613 --> 21:38.653
(loud rumbling)

21:38.655 --> 21:39.964
(passengers gasp)

21:41.375 --> 21:42.466
ATTENDANT (over PA):
<i> Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

21:42.693 --> 21:43.467
<i> the captain has turned on</i>

21:43.694 --> 21:44.618
<i> the fasten seat belt sign.</i>

21:44.637 --> 21:46.028
<i> Please return to your seats</i>

21:46.121 --> 21:47.530
<i> and fasten your seat belts.</i>

21:47.548 --> 21:49.307
Oh, my Lord.

21:51.052 --> 21:53.436
It must be coming
from the engine. It's on fire!

21:59.727 --> 22:00.651
(glass shatters)

22:00.878 --> 22:02.320
(passengers screaming)

22:16.077 --> 22:18.169
(screaming continues)

22:19.655 --> 22:20.629
Dad!

22:21.582 --> 22:22.673
Dad! Dad!

22:24.326 --> 22:25.634
Unbuckle the seat belt!

22:27.421 --> 22:28.637
(wind gusting)

22:35.671 --> 22:37.188
Go this way!

22:42.528 --> 22:44.195
We gotta plug that up!

22:54.599 --> 22:56.448
PILOT:
<i> Folks, please remain calm.</i>

22:56.525 --> 22:58.434
<i> We still have</i>
<i> control of the airplane.</i>

22:58.452 --> 23:00.044
<i> We're gonna be</i>
<i> depressurizing the cabin</i>

23:00.195 --> 23:02.213
<i> and returning</i>
<i> to the Austin Airport.</i>

23:03.124 --> 23:05.508
Hey, Genevieve, wake up.
Come on.

23:06.552 --> 23:08.535
-Wake up.
-Where am I?

23:08.629 --> 23:09.962
You're still on the plane.

23:10.114 --> 23:11.630
I must have nodded off.

23:11.782 --> 23:13.057
Why aren't we sitting down?

23:13.208 --> 23:14.283
Let's keep you steady.

23:14.376 --> 23:16.118
I think you might
have a concussion.

23:16.120 --> 23:18.062
Dad, I need you to grab me
a blanket and a medkit.

23:18.289 --> 23:19.288
It should be
somewhere in the galley.

23:19.381 --> 23:21.065
I feel like I can't breathe.

23:21.216 --> 23:22.791
-Why can't I breathe?
-The air's still thin up here.

23:22.885 --> 23:24.568
But we're descending.
You'll be able to breathe soon.

23:24.795 --> 23:25.978
What happened to me?

23:26.072 --> 23:27.613
There was an incident
on the plane.

23:28.649 --> 23:29.648
You were hurt.

23:29.800 --> 23:31.800
Did I go outside?

23:31.819 --> 23:33.152
I feel like I went outside,

23:33.304 --> 23:34.728
but that's not right.

23:34.822 --> 23:36.080
Only for a few seconds

23:36.307 --> 23:37.415
but you...
you're gonna be fine.

23:38.492 --> 23:41.544
-(winces)
-Hey, hey, hey. Genevieve?

23:42.663 --> 23:44.463
(rumbling)

23:49.411 --> 23:51.411
Hey, Genevieve, can you breathe?

23:51.431 --> 23:52.346
(weakly): Yeah.

23:53.099 --> 23:54.673
I'm gonna be okay, though?

23:54.767 --> 23:56.675
Your pulse is a fast,
but it's strong

23:56.769 --> 23:59.311
and your respiration is...

23:59.680 --> 24:00.646
uh...

24:03.834 --> 24:06.277
It's-- it's good.
Um...

24:11.767 --> 24:12.741
(Genevieve groans)

24:19.292 --> 24:20.440
(wincing)

24:20.534 --> 24:21.459
What do you need, son?

24:22.462 --> 24:24.336
There's nothing
in the kit for this.

24:25.113 --> 24:27.631
(dramatic music playing)

24:32.530 --> 24:32.928
So with this tray,
we're at 35,
36 vials of morphine.

24:37.310 --> 24:39.034
Good, that matches the count.

24:39.036 --> 24:40.035
Thank God.

24:40.054 --> 24:41.645
Okay, let's go to Ativan next.

24:41.797 --> 24:43.731
(sighs) Yep.

24:46.227 --> 24:48.043
Why do I feel like
we're doing something shady?

24:48.546 --> 24:50.470
Like we're going through
TK's dirty laundry?

24:51.065 --> 24:52.973
-How many you got there?
-All ten.

24:53.067 --> 24:53.991
Alright.

24:54.142 --> 24:55.659
You're not doing anything shady.

24:55.736 --> 24:56.902
You're a great medic

24:56.996 --> 24:58.537
and a great friend.

24:59.332 --> 25:00.664
Well, it feels pretty shady.

25:01.575 --> 25:02.666
(cell phone ringing)

25:05.412 --> 25:07.246
-Owen?
-OWEN (over phone):
<i> Hey, Tommy, we have a problem.</i>

25:07.322 --> 25:08.731
Did you miss your flight?

25:08.749 --> 25:10.657
I wish.
We're on the plane,

25:10.676 --> 25:11.734
we lost an engine.

25:11.827 --> 25:13.235
Pilot has the airplane
under control,

25:13.404 --> 25:15.996
but a passenger was injured
when the cabin depressurized.

25:16.015 --> 25:17.163
Oh.

25:17.258 --> 25:18.590
OWEN:<i> We're gonna</i>
<i> need your expertise</i>

25:18.684 --> 25:19.575
<i> with this wound.</i>

25:19.744 --> 25:20.743
I've got TK right here.

25:20.761 --> 25:22.077
Hey, Cap.

25:22.371 --> 25:24.763
Hey, buddy. Uh, tell me
what you're dealing with.

25:24.857 --> 25:27.024
TK:
<i> We've got a 50-something</i>
<i> female with a concussion.</i>

25:27.251 --> 25:28.417
<i> She's close</i>
<i> to exsanguinating</i>

25:28.435 --> 25:30.769
from a deep laceration
to the right axilla.

25:30.921 --> 25:32.029
GENEVIEVE:
Oh, I'm fine, honey.

25:32.198 --> 25:33.531
No need for a fuss.

25:34.200 --> 25:37.201
Okay, TK, your-your dad said
that your patient was injured

25:37.428 --> 25:39.352
when the plane depressurized?

25:39.372 --> 25:41.113
TK:<i> Yeah, the window blew</i>

25:41.207 --> 25:43.189
and she was partially
sucked out of the plane.

25:43.209 --> 25:44.875
<i> And she hit</i>
<i> the frame pretty hard.</i>

25:45.027 --> 25:46.192
NANCY: The window blew?

25:46.771 --> 25:48.270
As in the plane window?

25:48.363 --> 25:49.880
TK:
<i> Yeah. And I'm trying</i>
<i> to stuff the wound</i>

25:50.032 --> 25:51.215
<i> with as much gauze</i>
<i> as I could find,</i>

25:51.366 --> 25:52.716
but it's in
an awkward angle and I--

25:52.868 --> 25:55.368
I can't put enough pressure
on it to stop the hemorrhaging.

25:55.388 --> 25:57.203
TOMMY: Alright, TK, I need you
to send me a video of the wound

25:57.298 --> 25:58.781
so that I know
what we're dealing with.

25:58.874 --> 26:00.040
TK:
<i> Alright. Stand by.</i>

26:00.801 --> 26:03.043
Alright, Genevieve, we're gonna
take a video of you, alright?

26:03.062 --> 26:04.562
GENEVIEVE: Not my best angle.

26:08.142 --> 26:09.984
-TK: Got it.
-Alright, it's sending.

26:11.404 --> 26:13.237
(rumbling)

26:14.574 --> 26:15.722
Hang on.

26:15.741 --> 26:16.982
Alright, you should have it.

26:17.076 --> 26:18.534
-(phone bloops)
-Got it.

26:20.654 --> 26:22.154
Cap, that thing is pumpin'.

26:23.140 --> 26:24.489
Hey, TK, the way
that blood is moving,

26:24.584 --> 26:27.067
<i> I'd say her axillary artery</i>
<i> was torn.</i>

26:27.086 --> 26:28.401
Agreed, so what do we do?

26:28.570 --> 26:30.979
TOMMY:<i> We need to apply</i>
<i> an even amount of pressure</i>

26:30.998 --> 26:32.089
to the wound at a slope

26:32.240 --> 26:33.649
that matches
the curve of her armpit.

26:33.818 --> 26:36.184
<i> Well, you need to get her</i>
<i> in a junctional tourniquet.</i>

26:36.186 --> 26:37.169
We don't have those
up here, Cap.

26:37.263 --> 26:39.079
Yeah, the medkit
is pretty threadbare.

26:39.173 --> 26:40.339
Well, you'll just have
to make your own.

26:40.491 --> 26:42.157
I had a motorcycle call once.

26:42.250 --> 26:43.992
<i> The guy had a similar bleed,</i>
<i> I used his helmet.</i>

26:44.011 --> 26:45.251
I jammed it up against the wound

26:45.420 --> 26:47.012
<i> and I fixed it in place</i>
<i> with jumper cables.</i>

26:47.164 --> 26:48.606
I don't think many people
brought a helmet

26:48.757 --> 26:49.832
with their carry-ons.

26:49.925 --> 26:50.941
I wouldn't expect so,
but it's alright.

26:51.168 --> 26:52.000
We're gonna figure this out.

26:52.019 --> 26:53.518
Nancy, uh, get the tablet,

26:53.613 --> 26:56.171
start image searching
the inside of plane cabins.

26:56.264 --> 26:58.932
Emergency gear,
uh, kitchen supplies,

26:58.951 --> 27:00.008
anything that we can use.

27:00.177 --> 27:01.452
<i> Guys, we're looking</i>
<i> for anything</i>

27:01.679 --> 27:04.496
with a smooth curve
and hard surface.

27:06.292 --> 27:06.907
Cap.

27:08.461 --> 27:10.961
TOMMY:
<i> Owen, is there an ice bucket</i>
<i> on the beverage cart?</i>

27:11.188 --> 27:12.204
We need an ice bucket!

27:12.356 --> 27:13.613
ATTENDANT:
Yep. Here!

27:13.633 --> 27:15.633
That's not gonna work.
It's plastic.

27:15.801 --> 27:17.709
Uh, what about a coffee pot?

27:17.803 --> 27:18.761
Yes.

27:19.788 --> 27:21.287
Ah! It's not in here.

27:21.307 --> 27:23.456
Alright, everybody look under
your seats for the coffee pot.

27:23.476 --> 27:25.458
It probably
rolled under somewhere.

27:25.478 --> 27:26.960
WOMAN:
Oh, here. Here it is.

27:26.979 --> 27:28.036
I've got it.

27:28.130 --> 27:28.979
Thank you.

27:29.131 --> 27:30.055
Alright, this should work.

27:30.207 --> 27:31.297
TOMMY:
<i> Okay, now I need you</i>

27:31.392 --> 27:32.966
<i> to press the rounded surface</i>

27:32.985 --> 27:34.968
<i> -against the wound.</i>
-Got it.

27:35.062 --> 27:37.562
And tie it into place
as tight as you can.

27:38.491 --> 27:40.549
That belt's not gonna be
long enough to reach
across the chest.

27:40.567 --> 27:42.384
Is there any way to remove
some seat belts?

27:42.477 --> 27:43.661
Yes! Yes.

27:44.664 --> 27:46.054
(Genevieve groans)

27:46.073 --> 27:47.498
TK: Hey, Genevieve,
it's gonna be okay.

27:50.411 --> 27:51.393
OWEN:
How do you wanna do this?

27:51.486 --> 27:53.153
Hold it in place
while I secure it.

27:53.172 --> 27:54.913
Hang tight, Genevieve,
hang tight.

27:55.065 --> 27:56.215
(groaning)

27:56.734 --> 27:57.675
Alright.

27:58.827 --> 28:00.177
(Genevieve groaning sharply)

28:00.328 --> 28:01.679
Alright, Genevieve,
I'm warning you,

28:01.906 --> 28:03.255
this is gonna get uncomfortable.

28:03.349 --> 28:04.306
Gonna?

28:04.833 --> 28:06.517
(screaming)

28:08.245 --> 28:10.688
(screaming continues over phone)

28:13.767 --> 28:15.150
Oh, my God.

28:16.195 --> 28:18.529
It worked!
Cap, the bleeding stopped.

28:20.366 --> 28:21.440
Genevieve, how's your pain?

28:21.534 --> 28:23.942
(sighs) Your daddy
didn't raise no liar.

28:24.036 --> 28:25.411
(Genevieve wincing)

28:28.449 --> 28:30.657
-(heavy breathing)
-Genevieve?

28:31.377 --> 28:34.253
Genevieve?
Hey! Hey, hey!
Genevieve?

28:35.530 --> 28:36.547
TK, what's happening?

28:37.365 --> 28:38.698
Her pulse is getting high.

28:38.718 --> 28:40.050
It's in the 130s and rising.

28:40.277 --> 28:42.461
She's lost too much blood.
Her heart is compensating.

28:42.613 --> 28:45.222
You need to push as much fluid
into her as possible.

28:45.449 --> 28:46.798
<i> Tell me that medkit</i>
<i> has saline.</i>

28:46.951 --> 28:49.375
It did, but we already used
half the liter that we had.

28:49.395 --> 28:51.395
We need saline!
Anybody got eye solution?

28:51.546 --> 28:53.546
OWEN: Anybody got
saline solution?

28:53.566 --> 28:55.048
Anybody?

28:55.568 --> 28:58.068
-No takers.
-TK: Cap. I'm losing her.

28:59.129 --> 29:00.645
-Nancy, any ideas?
-To improvise saline?

29:00.740 --> 29:02.147
-Yes!
-Let me look.

29:02.724 --> 29:04.466
Uh, coconut water.

29:04.744 --> 29:05.725
<i> Soldiers in World War II</i>

29:05.819 --> 29:07.319
used that
for intravenous fluids.

29:07.413 --> 29:09.321
It does have a high
concentration of electrolytes,

29:09.415 --> 29:11.823
but it's not gonna work
for very long.

29:11.917 --> 29:13.141
Don't worry, we're not
gonna be in the air for long.

29:13.401 --> 29:14.918
First class, you gotta have
coconut water somewhere.

29:15.145 --> 29:16.328
-Yes.
-OWEN: Bring me
everything you got.

29:17.405 --> 29:19.405
TOMMY:
<i> Owen, how did you know</i>
<i> about the coconut water?</i>

29:19.425 --> 29:20.382
I read.

29:24.505 --> 29:26.221
Alright, give it
a squeeze, Dad.

29:38.760 --> 29:39.693
Keep going.

29:50.030 --> 29:51.330
(muttering)

29:57.797 --> 29:59.004
(TK sighs)

30:03.527 --> 30:05.969
OWEN:<i> Captain,</i>
<i> she's regained consciousness.</i>

30:08.198 --> 30:09.640
I'm glad to hear it.

30:09.791 --> 30:11.225
(chuckles)

30:13.128 --> 30:15.604
Way to fight, Genevieve.
Way to fight.

30:17.541 --> 30:20.484
Oh, you gotta get cleaned up
before we land.

30:21.303 --> 30:22.694
You're gonna
see your mama, right?

30:24.231 --> 30:26.448
You don't want her
to see you looking like that.

30:27.142 --> 30:28.717
-No.
-(laughs)

30:28.810 --> 30:30.619
-No, I don't.
-Yeah.

30:42.733 --> 30:44.591
(heavy breathing)

30:53.686 --> 30:54.601
(rumbling)

30:59.507 --> 31:01.249
ATTENDANT (over PA):
<i> We'll be experiencing</i>
<i> some turbulence</i>

31:01.343 --> 31:02.508
<i> for the next few minutes.</i>

31:02.603 --> 31:04.677
<i> The captain has requested</i>
<i> that all passengers</i>

31:04.697 --> 31:06.254
<i> return to their seats.</i>

31:06.273 --> 31:07.513
<i> Please make sure</i>
<i> your seat belts are fastened</i>

31:07.533 --> 31:09.349
<i> and any items not secured</i>
<i> in the overhead bin</i>

31:09.443 --> 31:12.352
<i> are stored underneath</i>
<i> the seat in front of you.</i>

31:12.371 --> 31:13.353
<i> Thank you.</i>

31:13.447 --> 31:14.746
-(knock on door)
-ATTENDANT: Sir?

31:16.116 --> 31:17.040
Sir?

31:17.192 --> 31:19.167
We need you to get back
to your seat.

31:20.287 --> 31:22.254
-(knock on door)
-Sir?

31:50.692 --> 31:52.200
Where'd you go?

31:54.562 --> 31:55.495
Bathroom.

31:58.642 --> 32:00.250
You must have
gotten up really quietly.

32:01.587 --> 32:03.979
You know, I might not be able
to buckle my own seat belt,

32:04.072 --> 32:05.422
but I can still go
to the bathroom

32:05.649 --> 32:06.632
without my mommy.

32:08.652 --> 32:09.968
What's the gum for?

32:10.596 --> 32:11.595
Seriously?

32:14.433 --> 32:16.007
I puked, alright?

32:16.101 --> 32:17.659
It beats the stomach acid.

32:17.678 --> 32:18.994
What's on your fingers?

32:19.087 --> 32:20.420
Oh, that, uh...

32:20.497 --> 32:22.439
It might be from
the soap dispenser.

32:22.590 --> 32:24.608
What's... What's up
with all the questions, Mom?

32:27.279 --> 32:30.172
Just trying to give you
an opportunity
to tell the truth.

32:30.265 --> 32:31.698
I am telling the truth.

32:37.105 --> 32:38.580
Look at me, TK.

32:42.369 --> 32:45.963
There is no one left
to lie to.

32:46.114 --> 32:47.631
I'm not lying, Mom.

32:51.119 --> 32:52.219
Why aren't you shaking anymore?

32:53.530 --> 32:56.431
It... It... It passes,
I already told you that.

32:58.310 --> 32:59.534
What were you doing
in the bathroom?

32:59.627 --> 33:01.311
Did you bring drugs
on this plane?

33:01.538 --> 33:03.371
No, you did everything short
of a body cavity search

33:03.465 --> 33:05.465
-before we got on.
-Maybe I should have done that.

33:05.484 --> 33:07.609
Yeah, well, maybe you should
mind your own damn business.

33:08.879 --> 33:10.487
You are my business, TK.

33:11.306 --> 33:13.281
You will always be my business.

33:15.160 --> 33:17.477
What do you think's
gonna happen in California?

33:17.496 --> 33:18.495
Hmm?

33:18.664 --> 33:19.738
Think I won't figure out

33:19.832 --> 33:21.164
where to score
within ten minutes?

33:21.667 --> 33:23.291
You can't save me, Mom.

33:26.063 --> 33:27.254
I know.

33:31.068 --> 33:32.426
But I have to try.

33:36.181 --> 33:39.433
I can't bear the thought of
going to my own son's funeral.

33:40.168 --> 33:42.227
I can't bear it.

33:49.528 --> 33:51.194
PILOT:
<i> Folks, please be advised</i>
<i> we're approaching</i>

33:51.421 --> 33:53.196
<i> Austin-Bergstrom</i>
<i> International Airport.</i>

33:53.423 --> 33:56.366
<i> And we expect to start</i>
<i> our descent in a few minutes.</i>

33:58.278 --> 34:00.162
-Dad?
-OWEN: Yes, son?

34:02.374 --> 34:03.540
I lied.

34:06.694 --> 34:09.287
I lied about what I was
doing in the ambulance
when you found me.

34:09.439 --> 34:11.364
TK, we don't have
to do this right now.

34:11.717 --> 34:12.758
It was fentanyl.

34:14.628 --> 34:17.262
I had two vials of fentanyl
in my hand when you found me.

34:19.283 --> 34:20.724
I was gonna steal it and...

34:21.727 --> 34:23.393
and get so high that...

34:24.137 --> 34:25.520
nothing mattered.

34:27.474 --> 34:28.565
And I was ready.

34:31.311 --> 34:33.278
And I would have done it
if you didn't find me.

34:36.133 --> 34:37.324
Well, I did find you.

34:40.304 --> 34:42.496
I can't believe I was
gonna do that to Mom.

34:45.233 --> 34:46.625
I'm so sorry, Dad.

34:51.423 --> 34:52.422
Hey.

34:53.592 --> 34:55.217
Everything's gonna be okay.

34:56.744 --> 34:57.761
(sniffles)

35:01.325 --> 35:04.392
(hopeful music playing)

35:07.773 --> 35:09.481
(rumbling)

35:12.669 --> 35:14.111
NEWSCASTER:<i> Folks,</i>
<i> we have a breaking story</i>

35:14.262 --> 35:16.429
<i> unfolding in the skies</i>

35:16.523 --> 35:18.022
<i> We're getting</i>
<i> our first look now</i>

<i> at Aero Blue flight 391,</i>
