01:14.761 --> 01:16.748
Sport casino floors.

01:16.830 --> 01:19.504
Over 100,000 square
feet of VIP gaming.

01:19.625 --> 01:22.174
I mean, she's a beauty.
She's of steel.

01:22.252 --> 01:24.220
Yeah, we're going to call her
the queen of the red.

01:24.296 --> 01:26.298
The grand casino.
It's going to be perfect.

02:21.310 --> 02:23.779
If you Wikipedia death,

02:23.855 --> 02:28.156
it says it is the permanent termination
of all biological functions

02:28.234 --> 02:32.410
that sustain
living organisms.

02:32.488 --> 02:35.458
What it doesn't tell you
is how to cope with death.

02:35.533 --> 02:37.627
You have
to let go, Gracie.

02:37.702 --> 02:40.000
It's the only way
to say goodbye.

02:40.079 --> 02:42.127
When we lost Samson,

02:42.206 --> 02:44.208
Gracie and I were the
saddest we've ever been.

02:44.292 --> 02:46.636
Bye, Samson.

02:46.711 --> 02:49.510
My Mom says that life
changing events,

02:49.589 --> 02:51.512
no matter
how big or small,

02:51.591 --> 02:53.434
happen in threes.

02:53.509 --> 02:55.807
I must get back
to work, okay?

02:55.887 --> 02:58.640
- Come.
- Wait. Did you sign it?

02:58.723 --> 03:00.441
Oh, no.

03:00.516 --> 03:02.985
Samson was the first.

03:03.060 --> 03:04.733
And then, he arrived.

03:04.812 --> 03:09.363
Look!
A horse?

03:09.442 --> 03:12.241
The third would happen
within four days,

03:12.320 --> 03:16.746
and show us that life
really comes full circle.

03:22.663 --> 03:24.336
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

03:30.588 --> 03:32.386
Can I help you?

03:37.637 --> 03:40.231
Yeah, this
the Henderson house?

03:40.306 --> 03:42.274
Sí.

03:43.809 --> 03:45.356
I'm your Uncle Scott.

03:45.436 --> 03:48.110
Your daddy's brother.

03:49.815 --> 03:51.032
He never mentioned me?

03:54.570 --> 03:58.370
You must be Todd.

03:58.449 --> 04:00.122
No, Charles.

04:00.201 --> 04:02.124
Shit.

04:03.579 --> 04:05.252
Caroline.

04:05.331 --> 04:09.211
My name is Gracie Ann,
and I'm 6 and 3/4s.

04:09.293 --> 04:13.548
Well, Gracie Ann,
I'm 31 years old.

04:13.631 --> 04:16.134
Excuse me, sir, but Mr. Henderson
is not here right now.

04:16.257 --> 04:19.011
- Where did he go?
- He's out of town for work.

04:19.095 --> 04:20.767
Ah.

04:20.846 --> 04:22.314
Can I pet your horse?

04:22.390 --> 04:24.563
You sure can.

04:24.642 --> 04:26.985
My horse's name
is Moose.

04:29.646 --> 04:31.114
Moosey.

04:31.189 --> 04:33.283
You can pat him.

04:33.358 --> 04:36.032
That's just him
saying hi.

04:37.988 --> 04:39.331
He's so nice.

04:41.449 --> 04:43.122
- Yeah, he's a good one.
- I like him.

04:43.201 --> 04:44.544
Me, too.

04:44.619 --> 04:46.292
Why do you ride
a horse?

04:46.371 --> 04:49.625
Well, Charles
I got a DUI.

04:49.708 --> 04:51.381
They took my license.

04:51.459 --> 04:53.712
Ain't that a bitch?

04:56.923 --> 04:58.470
So, what
happened here?

04:58.550 --> 05:00.678
Samson passed away.

05:00.760 --> 05:03.855
Oh, I'm sorry.

05:03.930 --> 05:06.774
That really sucks.
How did it happen?

05:06.850 --> 05:10.775
I'm in the middle of an investigation.
Could be foul play.

05:10.854 --> 05:13.448
- You mean murder?
- Possibly.

05:13.523 --> 05:15.366
Samson have
many enemies?

05:15.442 --> 05:17.319
I haven't ruled
anyone out yet,

05:17.402 --> 05:19.746
but there is one person
I'm focusing on.

05:19.821 --> 05:23.576
Oh, who's that?

05:23.658 --> 05:26.457
If I wanted carnations, don't you
think I would've ordered them?

05:26.536 --> 05:28.459
I asked
for the great rose.

05:28.538 --> 05:31.633
I asked for them.
I did ask for them.

05:31.708 --> 05:33.961
Mom hates frogs.

05:34.044 --> 05:36.843
Did you say a frog?
Wait, Samson was a frog?

05:36.921 --> 05:39.174
He was an oriental
fire belly toad.

05:39.257 --> 05:42.682
You got a fucking
love frog.

05:42.761 --> 05:44.809
Shh.

05:44.888 --> 05:48.893
He was a nice king frog.
He never got to be a prince.

05:48.975 --> 05:50.943
At least I got
a chance to know him.

05:51.019 --> 05:54.899
I think that's about the
nicest eulogy I ever heard.

05:54.981 --> 05:57.951
I should be so lucky
when I go.

05:58.068 --> 06:00.992
- What's a eulogy?
- It's what you say at a funeral.

06:01.071 --> 06:03.870
- Yes, your psalm.
- Your psalm?

06:03.948 --> 06:06.497
Like your net worth.

06:06.576 --> 06:09.796
That grand total of your
entire life in three lines.

06:09.871 --> 06:13.842
All right, you guys,
enough of this nonsense.

06:13.917 --> 06:16.386
What the hell
is that?

06:19.547 --> 06:23.177
Who are you?
Excuse me.

06:23.259 --> 06:24.886
Check this out.

06:24.969 --> 06:27.313
Hey, sister.
How the hell are you?

06:32.643 --> 06:34.316
Nice house.

06:34.394 --> 06:37.022
Why are you here?
You need money?

06:37.106 --> 06:40.861
Mom told me you all needed my help.
So, here I am.

06:40.943 --> 06:43.037
Your mother?
When?

06:43.112 --> 06:44.830
Couple of days ago.

06:44.905 --> 06:47.499
Couple of days ago?
Where?

06:47.574 --> 06:48.621
Coffee shop.

06:48.742 --> 06:51.370
- Nana?
- Yeah, Nana.

06:51.453 --> 06:54.047
I refer to her
as Mom but--

06:54.123 --> 06:56.467
- Scott, are you okay?
- Nana's dead.

06:56.542 --> 07:01.139
Yes, I know. That's
what makes it so wild.

07:01.213 --> 07:04.308
I'm sitting there at Jake's a couple of
days ago having a coffee and a smoke

07:04.383 --> 07:08.638
when, I don't know where, Mom's
sitting next to me. I swear to God.

07:08.720 --> 07:13.351
I just' smoked a little that morning,
so I thought it was me being high,

07:13.433 --> 07:16.528
but buzz wore off,
she stuck round.

07:16.603 --> 07:19.152
She told me
some stuff.

07:19.231 --> 07:22.861
One thing leads to
another, and here I am.

07:22.943 --> 07:27.073
How come we've
never met you?

07:27.156 --> 07:29.534
- I've been--
- Been traveling.

07:29.616 --> 07:32.995
Traveling?
Where? Honduras?

07:34.496 --> 07:36.590
I ain't never made it
to Honduras.

07:36.665 --> 07:38.338
Truth calls
for some whiskey.

07:40.335 --> 07:42.929
Shit.

07:43.005 --> 07:47.636
Charles, I've spent the better part of the
last eight years in and out of hospitals.

07:47.718 --> 07:50.938
- Are you a doctor?
- Thank you, Charles.

07:51.013 --> 07:52.731
No.

07:52.806 --> 07:54.353
Are you sick?

07:54.433 --> 07:55.980
You could say that.

07:56.059 --> 07:57.777
Testicular cancer?

07:57.853 --> 08:00.606
That's what Lance
Armstrong suffered from.

08:02.107 --> 08:03.950
Do you like
Lance Armstrong?

08:04.026 --> 08:06.279
No.

08:06.361 --> 08:09.285
No to a testicular cancer or
no to liking Lance Armstrong?

08:09.406 --> 08:12.910
- Both. - So, why were
you in the hospital?

08:12.993 --> 08:14.745
Your uncle
here is---

08:14.828 --> 08:18.207
Was a little crazy and a
kind of a drug addict.

08:18.290 --> 08:21.920
- Gracie. - What? It's all right.
It's just funny.

08:22.002 --> 08:25.802
Who doesn't think
a crazy person's fun?

08:25.881 --> 08:28.600
Point is,
I'm better now.

08:28.675 --> 08:32.350
Is that why you had coffee a couple
of days ago with your dead mother?

08:32.429 --> 08:34.477
So, for the last
eight years

08:34.556 --> 08:36.933
you've been in a
mental institution?

08:37.015 --> 08:40.691
In and out. Also spent
quite a bit of time

08:40.770 --> 08:44.650
in a rehab facility for drug
and alcohol dependency.

08:44.732 --> 08:46.985
It ain't tight.

08:47.068 --> 08:49.287
You know, guys,
go upstairs, please.

08:49.362 --> 08:51.490
- Louisa!
- What?

08:51.572 --> 08:53.540
Please, take
the children upstairs.

08:56.285 --> 08:59.585
In English in the house when
Mommy's around, please-

09:01.666 --> 09:03.839
Why are you here?

09:03.918 --> 09:06.387
Fuck me.
Why are you here?

09:06.462 --> 09:09.090
We moved here to be closer to
your dad after your mom died.

09:09.215 --> 09:12.344
He has-- Alzheimers, so he says.

09:12.426 --> 09:14.599
Hey, hey, how
did you know that?

09:14.679 --> 09:17.432
Mom told me.

09:17.515 --> 09:19.358
There's no smoking
in the house.

09:25.147 --> 09:26.444
Come on.

09:29.026 --> 09:31.779
You know, Cathy, I never figured you
for living in a house like this.

09:31.862 --> 09:35.162
Things change.
People change.

09:35.241 --> 09:39.542
Did you hear me? There's
no smoking in the house.

09:39.620 --> 09:41.998
All right.

09:42.081 --> 09:44.550
You know what?
Mom's right.

09:44.625 --> 09:47.003
Is that how you should
have been at her funeral?

09:47.128 --> 09:51.304
- No, about Charles.
- Really? What did she say?

09:54.260 --> 09:57.264
- Is he gay?
- What?

09:57.346 --> 10:00.225
I don't know why she said he's
gay, but he is a little strange.

10:03.894 --> 10:06.568
It's a Vicodin.
You want one?

10:06.647 --> 10:09.116
No, I don't want
a Vicodin.

10:09.191 --> 10:11.444
Doctor's orders.

10:13.362 --> 10:15.080
Where's Willy?

10:15.156 --> 10:17.875
He'd deck you if he heard
you call him that.

10:17.950 --> 10:21.204
Shreveport, I think,
till Thursday.

10:21.287 --> 10:23.585
- Today's Sunday?
- Today's Tuesday.

10:25.416 --> 10:28.590
So, I lost a couple
of days somewhere.

10:28.669 --> 10:31.593
I take it there isn't a job you
have to be at during the week?

10:31.672 --> 10:33.674
What's your job?

10:37.636 --> 10:39.684
All right.

10:42.682 --> 10:45.777
I really want
to see my brother,

10:45.852 --> 10:49.026
so I'm thinking maybe I'll just
hang here until he gets back.

10:53.443 --> 10:56.617
It is great
to see you, Cathy.

10:56.696 --> 10:58.698
You still look
pretty hot-

11:09.459 --> 11:11.678
Now, you were killing
it out there today.

11:11.753 --> 11:14.302
Big dog,
teach in a clinic.

11:17.133 --> 11:18.976
You all right?

11:19.052 --> 11:21.146
Yeah.

11:21.221 --> 11:24.976
We've just got to convince the
broker to give us a few more days

11:25.058 --> 11:28.153
on the option.
It should happen.

11:28.228 --> 11:31.402
Yeah. that's not what
I'm talking about.

11:32.982 --> 11:35.155
Hey, what's up?

11:40.532 --> 11:42.660
I, uh,

11:42.742 --> 11:45.746
when I get back to Dallas,
I'm going to leave my wife.

12:03.138 --> 12:05.140
Hi, what's happening?

12:12.439 --> 12:16.114
Hey, Charles, that
Xbox work out there?

12:16.192 --> 12:17.865
I already beat
all the games.

12:17.944 --> 12:20.038
Oh, yeah?

12:20.113 --> 12:21.865
What are you
working on?

12:21.948 --> 12:24.121
An oral report
for class.

12:24.200 --> 12:25.827
I'll tell you what.

12:25.910 --> 12:28.709
You hit them books,
and after dinner

12:28.788 --> 12:31.667
you and I'll get our game on.
Deal?

12:47.557 --> 12:49.650
Oh, man.

12:57.900 --> 13:00.073
How come you
call her that?

13:00.152 --> 13:02.780
How come I called
who what?

13:02.863 --> 13:05.082
Mommy "sister."

13:05.157 --> 13:08.787
I don't know. I guess I made it
up after she married your daddy.

13:08.869 --> 13:11.713
Technically Katherine 's
not your sister.

13:11.788 --> 13:14.086
- She's your sister-in-law.
- Hm.

13:14.166 --> 13:16.510
How come she doesn't like you?

13:18.420 --> 13:20.218
You don't think
she likes me?

13:20.297 --> 13:22.095
She's pretty mean
to you.

13:22.174 --> 13:25.303
Yeah, that's just
'cause we go way back.

13:25.385 --> 13:29.356
I bet you guys didn't know that your mommy
and I were high school sweethearts.

13:31.225 --> 13:33.273
Did you
and mommy kiss?

13:33.352 --> 13:36.276
Of course we kissed. Lovers,
we did everything. I--

13:36.355 --> 13:38.858
Is that why
you went to the rehab?

13:39.983 --> 13:41.200
Probably.

13:58.001 --> 13:59.594
Yeah?

13:59.670 --> 14:01.843
- Dinner's almost ready.
- All right, homie.

14:01.922 --> 14:05.017
- You can sit by me.
- Awesome.

14:27.447 --> 14:29.745
We'll give him
five more minutes.

14:32.035 --> 14:34.333
Kids, I don't want you to get
too attached to your uncle.

14:34.413 --> 14:36.006
He's got a lot
of problems.

14:36.081 --> 14:38.834
- Maybe we can help him.
- I think he's funny.

14:38.917 --> 14:40.294
Where does he live?

14:40.377 --> 14:41.629
I don't know.

14:41.712 --> 14:43.259
Is he married?

14:43.338 --> 14:45.136
I doubt it.

14:45.215 --> 14:47.138
- Does he have any kids?
- Oh, God, I hope not.

14:47.217 --> 14:50.016
- Where does he work?
- I'm sure he doesn't.

14:50.095 --> 14:52.018
Where does
he get money?

14:52.097 --> 14:54.645
That's probably
why he's here.

14:54.724 --> 14:57.648
How come he gets
to have a horse?

14:57.727 --> 14:59.855
Why were
you lovers?

15:02.398 --> 15:03.615
Eat.

15:12.033 --> 15:13.660
Uncle Scott?

15:16.162 --> 15:18.164
Uncle Scott?

15:33.137 --> 15:35.606
I'm fucking starving.

15:37.141 --> 15:40.736
Why do you have
a horse?

15:40.811 --> 15:43.564
This guy of Memphis owed me some money.
I took the horse instead.

15:43.648 --> 15:46.197
Worked out well, 'cause
I got a couple of DUIs,

15:46.275 --> 15:49.119
and I can't operate
anything with a key.

15:49.195 --> 15:51.163
Good thing
we lock our doors.

15:52.823 --> 15:54.917
- Where is everybody?
- In bed.

15:54.992 --> 15:57.586
That's the plate
Charles' made for you,

15:57.662 --> 16:01.132
and exquisite is the dinner he refused to eat
'cause he was waiting for his Uncle Scott.

16:01.207 --> 16:03.175
Shit.

16:03.250 --> 16:06.424
I got in the fucking tub, and
the next thing you know--

16:06.504 --> 16:08.882
I think it's time
for you to leave.

16:08.964 --> 16:11.808
I missed dinner.

16:11.884 --> 16:15.354
Big fucking deal. I mean, I
didn't know there were rules.

16:15.429 --> 16:19.059
Oh, there are rules.

16:19.141 --> 16:22.645
You can come back on Thursday
when William returns.

16:22.728 --> 16:25.322
I said I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.

16:25.398 --> 16:27.571
I'm not the one you need
to apologize to.

16:27.650 --> 16:30.950
I don't know about that. I'm sure I
owe you a couple from somewhere.

16:31.028 --> 16:34.532
We haven't seen or heard from you since
you made that scene at the wedding.

16:34.615 --> 16:36.788
You show up, you call
me a bad mother.

16:36.867 --> 16:39.916
My son a homosexual, or at
the very least strange,

16:39.995 --> 16:45.001
and your horse is ruining
my fucking flowers.

16:45.084 --> 16:47.007
Wait a minute.

16:47.086 --> 16:50.966
First of all, I never
called you a bad mother.

16:51.048 --> 16:52.925
And I'm sorry
about the wedding.

16:53.008 --> 16:54.806
I probably shouldn't
have been there,

16:54.885 --> 16:57.934
but you all probably
shouldn't have invited me.

16:58.013 --> 17:00.765
You were the best man.

17:00.849 --> 17:02.317
Was I?

17:02.392 --> 17:04.770
Did you smoke
this part of the story?

17:04.894 --> 17:09.194
- You left me.
- I left Texas, not you.

17:09.273 --> 17:12.699
You were the one
who chose to stay.

17:14.612 --> 17:16.079
I sent you a ticket.

17:23.747 --> 17:26.546
You've hurt everyone who's
ever cared about you,

17:26.624 --> 17:30.925
and I can't let you do the
same thing to my children.

17:31.004 --> 17:34.178
I will make it up to Charles.
I promise you.

18:25.600 --> 18:27.648
Scott?

18:33.316 --> 18:35.865
Mom?

18:40.240 --> 18:42.334
Now, you really think
that's a good idea?

18:42.408 --> 18:45.161
You promised

18:49.999 --> 18:53.003
# I'm just

18:53.086 --> 18:56.966
# A rambling man

19:00.677 --> 19:03.521
# I roam from

19:03.596 --> 19:07.520
# Town to town

21:16.811 --> 21:18.813
Morning,
morning, morning.

21:18.896 --> 21:21.649
Gracie, shh.
Mama's on the phone.

21:25.236 --> 21:28.410
- Good morning, Uncle Scott.
- Yeah.

21:28.489 --> 21:31.459
You missed
spaghetti.

21:31.534 --> 21:33.753
I fell asleep
in the tub.

21:33.828 --> 21:37.173
It's dangerous. I wear
floaties in the tub.

21:40.626 --> 21:42.253
- Morning, sis.
- Morning, bro.

21:45.923 --> 21:48.392
What up, Charlie?

21:48.467 --> 21:52.938
Dude, I rode about 400 miles
on a horse yesterday.

21:53.014 --> 21:56.063
I was dead tired.
I'm sorry.

21:56.142 --> 22:00.773
I was really looking forward to our first
family meal with you all, and playing games.

22:02.106 --> 22:03.949
He fell asleep
in the tub.

22:04.025 --> 22:05.618
Yeah.

22:05.693 --> 22:08.412
I believe it's time for schoo,.

22:08.487 --> 22:09.739
You ready, Louisa?

22:15.828 --> 22:19.549
All right, great.
Just fucking ignore me.

22:25.171 --> 22:26.423
Kids!

22:26.547 --> 22:30.017
- Louisa!
- They left already.

22:30.092 --> 22:31.810
Oh.

22:31.886 --> 22:34.230
Okay, well, I'm
running late, so.

22:34.305 --> 22:36.273
Louisa will be back.
Just don't touch anything.

22:36.348 --> 22:39.022
Hey, what did
Willie say?

22:39.101 --> 22:43.151
No smoking in the house,
including marijuana, no Vicodin.

22:43.230 --> 22:45.073
No drugs
in my house.

22:45.149 --> 22:47.493
Yes, ma'am.

23:26.731 --> 23:28.529
The center of the table, please.

24:20.034 --> 24:21.786
Oh, shit!

24:23.496 --> 24:24.873
What are you doing?

24:24.956 --> 24:26.799
What's your
favorite cartwheel?

24:29.169 --> 24:30.967
I don't really
have one.

24:31.045 --> 24:34.265
Well, do you like
grapefruit juice?

24:34.340 --> 24:35.842
Yeah.

24:38.303 --> 24:41.307
I really screwed up
with Charles, didn't I?

24:41.389 --> 24:43.687
Do you think
he'll forgive me?

24:50.982 --> 24:52.734
- It's your time.
- Okay.

24:52.817 --> 24:55.195
Gentlemen,
it's a pleasure.

24:55.278 --> 24:57.781
I'm lead counsel for the private
interest who controls the lease

24:57.864 --> 24:59.741
on the riverfront
property.

24:59.824 --> 25:02.043
Dana!

25:02.118 --> 25:03.961
- Billy?
- Yeah.

25:04.037 --> 25:05.505
- Hey.
- How are you doing?

25:05.580 --> 25:07.332
Great.
Great to see you.

25:07.415 --> 25:09.383
You, too. I didn't know
you were on this project.

25:09.459 --> 25:11.336
Yeah.

25:11.419 --> 25:13.137
Thank you,
Miss Earling.

25:13.213 --> 25:15.636
That was quite
exceptional.

25:15.715 --> 25:20.437
Next up, Mr. Henderson
on the subject of the Aztecs.

25:20.511 --> 25:22.558
- You ready?
- Yes, sir.

25:28.268 --> 25:29.770
Well then,
let's hear if.

25:29.853 --> 25:32.732
Quiet, people!

25:32.814 --> 25:35.067
Go ahead, Charles.

25:39.363 --> 25:41.331
Those of you who didn't
get to speak today,

25:41.406 --> 25:43.909
will be unrehearsed for Friday.
I hope you are prepared.

25:46.119 --> 25:49.248
I like butterflies,
and I like bees,

25:49.331 --> 25:51.709
and I like,
of course I like pets.

25:51.792 --> 25:55.137
Gracie, hold on.

25:55.212 --> 25:58.466
I like guinea pigs and I like
birds, and I like bears.

25:58.548 --> 26:00.016
How about a hairdo?

26:00.092 --> 26:02.186
Uh, not too tight.

26:02.261 --> 26:04.184
So, you've done this
before, Gracie. Right?

26:04.263 --> 26:06.015
Never. Not even on my dolls.

26:06.098 --> 26:07.850
What kind of haircut
do you want?

26:07.933 --> 26:10.356
Do you want it casual?
Do you want it fancy?

26:10.435 --> 26:14.406
Oh, man. This perfume's
really-- it's hard on the eyes.

26:14.481 --> 26:16.154
Now what happens?

26:21.738 --> 26:23.160
Ow!

26:23.240 --> 26:25.117
Sorry.

26:25.242 --> 26:27.665
- Do you see any blood back there?
- No, you're fine.

26:27.744 --> 26:29.212
I'll show you.
Come here.

26:35.544 --> 26:36.670
No laughing.

26:36.753 --> 26:39.097
So, how
am I looking?

26:40.966 --> 26:43.185
Ready for school.

26:43.260 --> 26:45.433
Unbelievable.

26:45.512 --> 26:49.312
I can't say that I'm surprised.
That is who she is.

26:49.391 --> 26:53.112
Ever since Josh got his inheritance,
she is a different person.

26:53.186 --> 26:56.736
Hi, everyone. Oh, Katherine,
what a great event.

26:56.815 --> 27:00.661
Oh, I've booked our tickets for
the 4th of July. So excited.

27:00.736 --> 27:03.831
I've rented this most
amazing house in Seaside.

27:03.905 --> 27:06.408
I'm surprising
William and the kids.

27:06.491 --> 27:09.540
- I mean, you all should come.
- That sounds wonderful.

27:09.619 --> 27:11.747
- I'll see you in a bit.
- See you later.

27:14.333 --> 27:18.804
What is going on? Sue said,
Elena said, Angie said

27:18.879 --> 27:21.052
some man came out of
your house this morning,

27:21.131 --> 27:23.600
and asked her son
for a cigarette.

27:23.675 --> 27:25.598
Are you having
an affair?

27:25.677 --> 27:27.771
It's okay if you are, but why
are we the last to know?

27:27.846 --> 27:29.472
No, no, it's William's brother.

27:29.555 --> 27:32.809
You're having
an affair with Scott?

27:32.892 --> 27:36.192
No, he's here
to see William.

27:36.270 --> 27:39.274
William is never--

27:39.357 --> 27:42.110
He's not home.

27:48.449 --> 27:50.497
Cool if I sit down?

27:50.576 --> 27:52.499
What are you
doing here?

27:54.205 --> 27:55.878
You're going
to get me in trouble.

27:55.956 --> 27:58.880
All right.
Well,

27:58.959 --> 28:01.462
how about this,
if I hide?

28:04.340 --> 28:05.762
Who's that?

28:05.841 --> 28:08.515
Amanda Hyde. Why?

28:08.594 --> 28:10.312
I think
she's into you.

28:10.388 --> 28:13.562
Question is,
are you into her?

28:13.641 --> 28:16.485
Hey, it's totally
okay if you're not.

28:16.560 --> 28:19.109
I am, but I think
you're crazy.

28:19.188 --> 28:21.566
She hates me.
They all make fun of me.

28:21.649 --> 28:24.277
That's
fucked up.

28:25.486 --> 28:27.488
Okay, how
about this?

28:27.571 --> 28:30.450
I'll go over there, and get Miss
Hyde to come and say hello.

28:30.533 --> 28:32.752
Then you and I are
square. Deal?

28:33.702 --> 28:35.079
Do-don't.

28:40.418 --> 28:42.671
That's some
good ass juice.

28:42.753 --> 28:46.383
You can't get juice
like that on the outside.

28:46.465 --> 28:49.935
I'm just screwing with you.
You can get juice on the outside.

28:50.010 --> 28:54.857
Not that I've ever been inside
of prison. I've been in jail.

28:54.932 --> 28:56.650
Don't freak out, dude.

28:56.725 --> 29:00.480
I got his-- I got
everybody in line.

29:02.606 --> 29:04.825
And this one's
for you, darling.

29:04.900 --> 29:06.527
See that little girl
at the end of the line

29:06.610 --> 29:08.658
with the pink ribbon
and pony tail?

29:08.737 --> 29:10.831
You get her
whatever she wants

29:10.906 --> 29:13.785
Tell her it's on Charles Henderson,
and you keep the change.

29:26.130 --> 29:28.132
How are you related to my dad?

29:28.215 --> 29:30.309
Thank you.

29:31.760 --> 29:33.932
Oh, boy, here comes Dr. Carr.

29:34.012 --> 29:35.514
He hates me.

29:35.638 --> 29:38.061
- Why?
- Because I cracked at him once.

29:39.309 --> 29:40.856
Hi, what's up?

29:40.935 --> 29:43.358
What is your name?

29:43.438 --> 29:45.406
Scott Henderson.

29:45.482 --> 29:47.860
Charles, do you know this man?

29:47.942 --> 29:49.990
He's my uncle.

29:50.069 --> 29:53.118
And you two
beautiful ladies are--

29:53.198 --> 29:57.499
Miss Carol. Nice to meet you.
And this is Miss Dougan.

29:57.577 --> 29:59.079
Join us!

29:59.162 --> 30:01.005
Juice?

30:01.080 --> 30:03.299
Excuse me, but you have
to have a visitor's badge

30:03.374 --> 30:05.172
in order to eat lunch
with a student.

30:05.251 --> 30:09.381
I do. And where is
your visitor's badge?

30:09.464 --> 30:11.466
I lost it.

30:11.549 --> 30:12.641
Where did you
lose it?

30:12.717 --> 30:14.845
Don't know.

30:14.928 --> 30:18.728
If I did, it wouldn't
be classified as lost.

30:18.806 --> 30:21.605
Who did you
check in with?

30:23.436 --> 30:25.609
All right, boss, you got me.
I didn't check in.

30:25.688 --> 30:28.612
I'm just here to have lunch with
my nephew. It's no big deal.

30:28.691 --> 30:31.114
Y'all feel free
to join us.

30:31.194 --> 30:33.697
Shit, we got juice
for fucking days.

30:33.780 --> 30:38.786
You will not use profanity toward an educator,
especially in front of his student.

30:38.868 --> 30:41.291
I didn't.
What did I say?

30:41.371 --> 30:43.715
You know what
you said, sir.

30:43.790 --> 30:46.634
Okay, that's it. Both
of you, let's go now!

30:46.709 --> 30:48.507
Now, hold up,
hold on.

30:48.586 --> 30:50.384
Your problem's
with me, not him.

30:51.506 --> 30:53.224
I'm leaving.

30:54.884 --> 30:56.636
All right.

30:56.719 --> 30:59.973
Miss Dougan
and Miss Carol.

31:00.056 --> 31:02.434
Later, Charles.

31:05.311 --> 31:07.279
Thank you, Charles

31:11.067 --> 31:13.320
From a very nice
Cohiba, and he says,

31:13.403 --> 31:16.532
"Son, I won't smoke a cigar if
it's smaller than my penis."

31:16.614 --> 31:18.992
I'll drink
to that.

31:19.075 --> 31:21.123
Come on.

31:21.202 --> 31:23.705
I never had a chance to talk to
you about that Carlton deal.

31:23.788 --> 31:26.382
The architecture from
that deal was flawless.

31:26.457 --> 31:28.334
You drove up the offer
against the Dow.

31:28.459 --> 31:31.508
- Five weekends in a row.
- Yeah.

31:31.588 --> 31:33.431
I didn't think
anybody noticed that.

31:33.548 --> 31:36.518
- I've used it on two deals since.
- No kidding? Wow.

31:36.593 --> 31:38.311
- You two work together in Dallas?
- Yeah.

31:38.386 --> 31:40.854
Thanks for the lift,
compadre.

31:40.971 --> 31:43.520
- Do you mind making another stop?
- Sí, cémo no.

31:45.892 --> 31:48.270
You've ever met
my old man?

31:49.771 --> 31:51.148
What are you,
a migrant?

31:52.774 --> 31:54.993
All right.

31:55.068 --> 31:57.241
It's up here
on the left.

32:12.794 --> 32:13.886
Hey...

32:16.715 --> 32:18.012
Who are you?

32:19.301 --> 32:20.894
Dad, it's Scott.

32:22.137 --> 32:25.437
Now, look here, mister.

32:25.515 --> 32:28.394
I don't know who
you're looking for,

32:28.477 --> 32:30.980
but I can assure you
it's not me.

32:31.063 --> 32:35.489
Sometimes I-I like
to talk to strangers.

32:35.567 --> 32:37.114
Sometimes I don't.

32:37.194 --> 32:39.447
I know you're faking
this sickness.

32:39.529 --> 32:41.952
You need to get off my property.

32:42.032 --> 32:44.581
Mom told me she wants
us to talk, so--

32:46.995 --> 32:50.090
You know what? You are
still a fucking asshole.

32:50.165 --> 32:51.712
I tried.

32:51.792 --> 32:55.137
Hey, I ain't going
to tell you again.

32:55.212 --> 32:57.510
- Are you kidding me?
- Mr. Henderson.

32:57.631 --> 33:00.475
- I'm leaving. I'm leaving.
- Go.

33:00.592 --> 33:03.015
- Calm down. - Why do these people
always coming round my house?

33:03.095 --> 33:05.473
Come on in the house.
Come on now.

33:05.555 --> 33:07.933
I got you a big bowl of chili.
Do you want some chili?

33:08.016 --> 33:12.647
Hi, Uncle Scott.
Uncle Scott.

33:12.729 --> 33:14.982
Louisa and I are cooking
eggplant tonight.

33:15.065 --> 33:16.863
Want to help?

33:16.942 --> 33:19.536
I ain't feeling
so hot, pretty girl.

33:25.534 --> 33:29.505
Mrs. Henderson, this is
Mr. Dewitt, Charles Principal.

33:29.579 --> 33:32.207
It seems we had
an incidence today.

33:32.290 --> 33:36.090
A man claiming to be Charles'
uncle broke into the cafeteria,

33:36.169 --> 33:38.263
shouted profanity
at a teacher,

33:38.338 --> 33:42.138
made a pass at one of our
aides, smoked cigarettes.

33:42.217 --> 33:44.094
The list goes on.

33:51.016 --> 33:53.018
Shit.

33:53.102 --> 33:54.570
Come in.

33:56.522 --> 33:59.867
Amanda thanked me for the juice box.
That was awesome.

33:59.942 --> 34:02.821
Yeah, it kind of was.

34:02.945 --> 34:05.664
- Listen, homie, I'm tired.
- I have to give an oral report

34:05.740 --> 34:09.085
on the Aztecs on Friday in
front of the whole school.

34:09.159 --> 34:11.413
Sweet.

34:13.164 --> 34:14.791
What's the problem?

34:18.377 --> 34:22.007
If I get a bad grade,
it'll ruin my average.

34:22.089 --> 34:23.841
They give grades
at your age?

34:23.924 --> 34:26.177
They do
in fourth grade.

34:26.260 --> 34:27.762
I thought
you were six.

34:27.844 --> 34:29.813
I'm eight.

34:29.889 --> 34:33.813
I skipped second grade, and I
want to make straight A's.

34:33.893 --> 34:37.362
Dude, there's a lot more to
life than just straight A 's-

34:42.275 --> 34:45.074
All right, so what's your problem?
You're a smart kid, man.

34:45.154 --> 34:48.033
I'm not very proficient
at oral reports.

34:48.114 --> 34:50.618
Public speaking
should be easy for you.

34:50.701 --> 34:52.418
Why?

34:52.495 --> 34:54.496
Because you're not
intimidated by shit.

34:54.580 --> 34:56.878
How do you know that
I'm not intimidated?

34:56.956 --> 35:01.212
Dude, look at you. The shirt,
the lie, the goddamn briefcase.

35:01.295 --> 35:04.595
All them things ain't nothing
more than FU's to everybody.

35:04.715 --> 35:06.888
- Yeah?
- Shit, yeah.

35:06.967 --> 35:09.595
Okay, here we go.

35:09.678 --> 35:12.807
A key
to public speaking.

35:12.890 --> 35:16.064
You find one face in the
crowd that you trust, okay?

35:16.143 --> 35:19.238
You focus on that face,
concentrate on it.

35:19.313 --> 35:22.692
Ignore everything else.

35:22.775 --> 35:26.530
And once you're comfortable with that
person, you start adding another, another,

35:26.612 --> 35:28.205
one by one.

35:28.280 --> 35:31.409
Before you know it,
you're good.

35:31.492 --> 35:34.336
Uncle Scott, will you
come to the assembly?

35:36.121 --> 35:38.419
I don't think that's
such a good idea.

35:38.499 --> 35:40.968
Please, just
this one time.

35:41.043 --> 35:44.343
I'll even get you
a visitor's pass.

35:46.549 --> 35:49.018
Shit, it's hard for me
to commit to things.

35:52.345 --> 35:54.598
All right.

35:54.681 --> 35:57.059
I'll be there.

35:57.141 --> 36:00.441
Katherine eluded to the
fact they're unreliable.

36:00.520 --> 36:02.522
So you have
to promise.

36:06.651 --> 36:08.528
I promise.

36:32.218 --> 36:34.596
What a day. I can't believe
we're still not closed.

36:34.679 --> 36:36.977
Oh, we're this close
to closing.

36:37.056 --> 36:38.979
Then you get to head
home after all this?

36:39.058 --> 36:42.653
I wish. New York on Monday.

36:42.729 --> 36:45.528
New Jersey on Saturday, and
home to Chicago on Thursday.

36:45.607 --> 36:47.701
That's quite
a schedule.

36:47.775 --> 36:49.448
Wow.

36:49.527 --> 36:51.700
Want to grab
a drink?

36:51.779 --> 36:54.703
Sure, sounds good.

36:54.782 --> 36:57.160
Okay, so you're
marrying Katie Couric.

36:57.243 --> 36:59.166
Yes. I'm Bill Couric.
How are you doing?

37:00.914 --> 37:03.588
That's a no brainer.
So, Ellen or Martha?

37:03.666 --> 37:06.044
Hold on. If you go with Ellen,

37:06.127 --> 37:07.504
you get
a little portion?

37:07.587 --> 37:09.840
No, it's only Ellen.

37:09.923 --> 37:13.644
Now, what about Martha? Is this a
one-night stand or a long-term affair?

37:13.718 --> 37:16.016
- Three times a week.
- Okay.

37:16.095 --> 37:18.689
I'm banging Ellen.
Final decision.

37:18.765 --> 37:21.268
So, you're going to
kill Martha Stewart.

37:21.351 --> 37:23.524
By default, even
though I don't want to

37:23.603 --> 37:26.402
'cause she's the one who has the
best taste out of all these women.

37:26.522 --> 37:30.117
- It's like killing Christmas.
- Yeah.

37:30.193 --> 37:33.072
You imagine the Christmas you'd
have with Martha Stewart?

37:33.154 --> 37:34.747
- Beautiful.
- My God.

37:34.822 --> 37:37.325
It would be like being
on the North Pole.

37:37.408 --> 37:39.627
Okay, you gotta play.

37:39.702 --> 37:44.549
You got
Rob Blagojevich, okay?

37:44.624 --> 37:47.503
Disgraced governor
of Illinois.

37:47.585 --> 37:50.964
Then you got Anthony Weiner,
disgraced congressman.

37:51.047 --> 37:54.517
And then you got
Skipper Spitzer.

37:54.592 --> 37:57.390
How about a little Elliot Spitzer?
Disgraced governor.

37:57.469 --> 37:59.892
Three guys on the ropes.
What do you do?

37:59.972 --> 38:03.226
Did you go to Charles'
school today?

38:03.308 --> 38:05.106
Somebody
missed dinner.

38:05.185 --> 38:07.938
- Did you?
- What did you hear?

38:08.021 --> 38:09.694
That you broke
into the school

38:09.773 --> 38:12.743
and started a fight
with one of the teachers?

38:12.818 --> 38:15.116
That's ridiculous.
That's not at all how--

38:15.195 --> 38:17.243
I'm not interested in your
version of the story.

38:17.364 --> 38:20.413
- I'll leave you alone for not even
half a day. - Well, full day.

38:20.492 --> 38:22.995
What part of "there are
rules" do you not understand?

38:23.078 --> 38:25.251
Like the one that forbids
absentee white trash uncles

38:25.330 --> 38:26.957
from trespassing
on school property,

38:27.040 --> 38:30.635
cursing in the cafeteria
and humiliating me!

38:30.711 --> 38:32.759
Wow.

38:32.838 --> 38:35.933
Just so you know?
You're kind of being a cunt.

38:39.177 --> 38:42.556
Dana Spencer.
No, no.

38:44.099 --> 38:46.397
You're flirting
with our deal.

38:48.437 --> 38:50.781
I'm not flirting
with our deal.

38:50.856 --> 38:54.156
Dana just happens to be an
old colleague, that's all.

38:56.194 --> 38:58.367
What's going on
with you and Katherine?

39:01.700 --> 39:04.499
Things just haven't been
very good for awhile.

39:04.578 --> 39:07.377
Well, well.

39:07.456 --> 39:10.960
What's Katherine say?

39:11.043 --> 39:15.093
I don't even-- I don't even
think think she knows.

39:17.424 --> 39:20.769
You know she was my
brother's first girlfriend?

39:20.844 --> 39:22.892
Yeah, that's
how we met.

39:24.848 --> 39:28.273
Yeah. My brother...

39:28.351 --> 39:32.231
He and my dad
had a big blowout.

39:32.314 --> 39:36.160
My brother left town. Just kind of
disappeared. Didn't come back.

39:36.234 --> 39:38.828
She was devastated,
you know?

39:38.904 --> 39:41.908
And, uh,
it just happened.

39:44.076 --> 39:46.499
Next thing you know,
she'd gotten pregnant.

39:46.578 --> 39:48.922
We got married.

39:48.997 --> 39:50.999
You know.

39:51.083 --> 39:54.212
She was just a kid.

39:54.294 --> 39:57.138
Oh, shot gun
wedding.

39:57.214 --> 40:01.219
No, no, not at all.
It was the real deal.

40:01.301 --> 40:04.645
She-- Yeah.

40:04.720 --> 40:09.021
She was really
what I wanted.

40:10.976 --> 40:13.195
But I don't know what's
happened now, you know.

40:13.270 --> 40:17.275
I've spent the better part of the
year trying to figure it out.

40:17.358 --> 40:18.985
I just --

40:21.195 --> 40:23.618
We just stopped
being us.

40:40.381 --> 40:42.759
This is William. Can't come
lo the phone right now,

40:42.842 --> 40:45.095
so please leave a message,
and I'll call you back.

40:45.177 --> 40:46.474
Thank you.

41:07.408 --> 41:09.251
Come on.

41:21.172 --> 41:22.924
That was
almost perfect,

41:23.007 --> 41:26.637
but then you kind of
cough like a bitch.

41:26.719 --> 41:28.721
- It's been ten years.
- Shit.

41:30.890 --> 41:33.393
Remember how you used to
make me shot gun your hits

41:33.475 --> 41:36.900
because you'd say
"Joints burnt my throat"?

41:37.021 --> 41:39.319
- They did burn my throat.
- Come on.

41:39.398 --> 41:43.028
You pulled filters
off of Camels.

41:43.110 --> 41:44.862
I think you were
just saying it

41:44.945 --> 41:46.868
'cause you wanted to get
close enough to kiss me.

41:46.947 --> 41:48.449
Yeah, right.

41:53.871 --> 41:56.294
I saw Dad today.

41:56.373 --> 41:58.046
And?

41:58.125 --> 42:00.628
He wanted to shoot
me in the face.

42:00.711 --> 42:02.634
He's really sick.

42:16.226 --> 42:18.228
So, how is it being a parent?

42:21.689 --> 42:26.570
It's amazing how quickly I
disappeared when Gracie was born.

42:26.653 --> 42:29.577
First kid's easy.

42:29.656 --> 42:33.251
Second kid
changes everything.

42:36.120 --> 42:38.088
Why do you ask?

42:38.164 --> 42:41.134
I don't know.

42:41.209 --> 42:44.804
I think I could've
made a good father.

42:44.879 --> 42:49.100
For real. I mean, I love
your little people.

42:54.847 --> 42:56.690
See this water?

42:56.766 --> 43:01.317
We test the PH of this water.
It's perfect.

43:01.396 --> 43:03.273
I don't even swim.

43:10.446 --> 43:13.871
God, pot is so--

43:13.950 --> 43:16.624
Wow.

43:18.288 --> 43:20.962
I forgot how much it
makes you wan to--

43:21.040 --> 43:23.839
Fuck?

43:23.918 --> 43:27.388
I was going to say
dance, you pervert.

43:27.463 --> 43:30.182
Don't give me that
cotillion bullshit.

43:30.258 --> 43:32.477
You and I
used to get stoned,

43:32.552 --> 43:35.305
and do it
all the fucking time.

43:40.268 --> 43:41.986
Shot gun?

43:42.061 --> 43:45.486
# Find a lover
and he treats me right

43:45.565 --> 43:48.944
# Comes over in the
middle Of the night

43:49.027 --> 43:52.531
# keeps me warm
when he holds me tight

43:52.613 --> 43:55.992
# Find a lover in the
middle of the night

43:56.075 --> 43:59.625
# Got a lover in the
middle of the desert

43:59.704 --> 44:03.049
# Quicksand and
a hot dry weather

44:03.124 --> 44:06.674
# And I know that we'll
always be together

44:06.753 --> 44:10.508
# Got a lover in the
middle of the desert #

44:16.762 --> 44:20.141
Did you think if you just
showed up out of the blue

44:20.223 --> 44:23.147
it would be like it
was in high school?

44:23.226 --> 44:25.820
That somehow I'd fall
back in love with you?

44:29.608 --> 44:31.030
No.

44:32.944 --> 44:35.948
I'm here to let you know you
made the right decision.

45:06.061 --> 45:09.156
I was back with
your father this afternoon.

45:09.231 --> 45:11.950
He tried to shoot me
in the face with a shotgun.

45:12.067 --> 45:15.697
- That thing wasn't loaded.
- Oh, come on.

45:15.779 --> 45:17.827
He was just scared.

45:17.906 --> 45:20.079
He acted like he
didn't know who I was.

45:23.370 --> 45:25.418
I don't know, Momma.

45:26.915 --> 45:29.293
This is a--

45:29.376 --> 45:32.255
- It's difficult shit for me to do.
- I know it is.

45:34.047 --> 45:37.597
Lucky me.
I love you.

45:37.676 --> 45:40.225
Love you, love you.

45:50.856 --> 45:51.982
Good morning.

45:54.276 --> 45:57.029
I'm going to the farmers' market.
Does anyone need anything?

45:57.112 --> 46:00.707
You are going
to the farmers' market?

46:00.782 --> 46:03.786
Mommy, can I come
to the farm, too?

46:03.869 --> 46:06.418
No, I'm getting
groceries.

46:08.999 --> 46:11.718
Of course you can come.
I'll drop you at school afterwards.

46:11.793 --> 46:14.046
Charles, any requests?

46:14.129 --> 46:16.257
Pomegranate juice.

46:20.301 --> 46:22.303
Hey, Carlos.

46:22.386 --> 46:23.854
I need
another favor.

46:23.929 --> 46:25.146
Qué?

46:25.222 --> 46:26.895
Otro favor pequeno.

46:26.974 --> 46:28.567
Oh, sí, sí
cémo no.

46:28.642 --> 46:31.316
All right,
vámonos.

46:35.483 --> 46:37.110
I'll be right back.

46:37.193 --> 46:39.116
Cuidado can el viejo.

46:42.781 --> 46:44.909
My God, I'm telling you
right now,

46:44.992 --> 46:46.710
I won't put up
with this no more.

46:46.827 --> 46:48.795
- Ain't going to happen no more.
- What's going on?

46:48.871 --> 46:50.873
Every day
I got to pay

46:53.709 --> 46:55.552
Can I help you?

46:55.669 --> 46:58.548
- Yeah, I'm Scott, George's son.
- I know who you are.

46:58.672 --> 47:01.016
Well, I want to talk to him.
Well, he's resting now.

47:01.091 --> 47:03.765
I've just seen him
on the porch with you.

47:03.844 --> 47:05.938
How many times
I got to tell you?

47:06.013 --> 47:09.358
Hey, hey it's all right. It ain't
even loaded. I got this, okay?

47:09.433 --> 47:13.688
Margaret, my mother, your wife,
sent me here to talk to you.

47:13.771 --> 47:16.399
Now, she wouldn't have done that
if you ain't know who I was.

47:16.482 --> 47:18.450
So, cut the shit,
old man.

47:18.526 --> 47:22.076
My Margaret
didn't send you here.

47:22.154 --> 47:24.873
Yes, she did. I talked
to her last night.

47:24.949 --> 47:28.544
No, you didn't.
You know how I know?

47:28.619 --> 47:30.713
Because I talked
to Margaret last night.

47:30.829 --> 47:32.797
Okay, well then you should--

47:32.915 --> 47:35.384
- Shit!
- You'd better move along!

47:35.459 --> 47:38.258
Don't you come back
here again.

47:55.771 --> 47:57.739
I need
a fucking drink.

47:57.815 --> 47:59.613
Orale, vamos.

48:01.569 --> 48:03.071
Are you ready
for this, boss?

48:03.153 --> 48:05.497
Oh, yeah. I was born to do this.

48:05.573 --> 48:07.075
Let's do it.

48:24.425 --> 48:26.973
Two shots of tequila
and two Coronas, please.

48:28.553 --> 48:31.727
You like
tequila, right?

48:31.806 --> 48:32.853
Of course you do.

48:37.061 --> 48:39.359
Ah, sí.
Tomo nota.

48:39.439 --> 48:41.112
Tomo nota.

48:43.151 --> 48:44.949
Louisa!

48:47.447 --> 48:48.744
Do you mind
taking over?

48:48.823 --> 48:50.245
I need to start
the marinade.

48:50.325 --> 48:51.998
We're cooking
salmon tonight.

49:07.216 --> 49:08.809
To a job well done.

49:08.885 --> 49:11.479
Likewise. Great work.
Great work.

49:11.554 --> 49:15.309
So, when's the last time
you shelled crabs?

49:15.391 --> 49:16.893
Should we
give it a try?

49:16.976 --> 49:19.946
You know anything
about Alzheimer's?

49:21.648 --> 49:22.945
Qué?

49:23.024 --> 49:24.822
No, me neither.

49:32.158 --> 49:34.456
You ain't going
to get in trouble.

49:36.371 --> 49:38.840
You ain't.

49:38.915 --> 49:40.588
I mean,
fuck it, right?

49:40.667 --> 49:43.045
Yeah, fuck it.

49:43.127 --> 49:45.346
Yeah.
She don't own you.

49:45.421 --> 49:48.095
See, that was always
her problem, man.

49:48.174 --> 49:51.929
Always wanting
to be in control.

49:52.011 --> 49:53.934
I have no control.

49:54.013 --> 49:55.936
Louisa,
has William called?

49:56.015 --> 49:57.608
No.

49:59.435 --> 50:01.108
I haven't told him
that Scott's here,

50:01.187 --> 50:03.110
so if he does call,
please don't say anything.

50:03.189 --> 50:04.532
Sí, señora.

50:04.607 --> 50:06.029
Although I did try
to call him

50:06.109 --> 50:08.032
and I started
to text him.

50:08.111 --> 50:10.705
I thought he's in the middle
of a big deal, best I wait.

50:10.780 --> 50:12.453
Sí, señora.

50:12.532 --> 50:14.330
Do you like him?

50:14.409 --> 50:16.628
Señor one
or señor two?

50:16.703 --> 50:18.831
Who's one?
Who's two?

50:18.913 --> 50:21.086
William.
I meant Scott.

50:21.165 --> 50:25.261
Yes, he's so shiola.

50:25.336 --> 50:27.054
He is.

50:28.256 --> 50:30.758
I go next.

50:30.841 --> 50:33.139
You know,
you shouldn't smoke.

50:33.218 --> 50:36.142
Yeah, well, cigarettes
are the least of my problems.

50:36.221 --> 50:39.316
Yeah?
What's your worst?

50:41.435 --> 50:43.938
My mouth.

50:44.020 --> 50:47.194
Hey. I thought
you were next.

50:50.569 --> 50:52.663
How long have you
and Carlos been married?

50:52.738 --> 50:57.164
- Fifteen years.
- Fifteen years?

50:57.242 --> 51:00.963
You ever wonder what your life would have
been like if you hadn't married him?

51:01.037 --> 51:03.711
Oh, aburrido.

51:03.790 --> 51:05.758
How do you say?
Boring.

51:12.257 --> 51:14.009
What's your name?

51:14.092 --> 51:16.186
Maria.

51:16.261 --> 51:20.437
Hey, you all. Maria slings this
shot, next round's on the gringo.

51:38.283 --> 51:41.127
Maybe he just doesn't
like eating at home.

51:41.203 --> 51:43.672
- I got a bet.
- Yeah?

51:44.790 --> 51:47.464
If I win.

51:47.542 --> 51:51.172
- When I win.
- Mm-hm.

51:51.254 --> 51:53.177
You take me home.

51:54.800 --> 51:56.097
And--

51:57.969 --> 51:59.892
Oh!

51:59.971 --> 52:01.598
Otros.

52:11.858 --> 52:13.906
Come on.

52:33.922 --> 52:36.640
In his room.
In his room.

52:38.759 --> 52:40.056
No way.
Let's go.

52:50.312 --> 52:52.986
- Good night, Mommy.
- Good night, baby.

52:58.779 --> 53:01.874
Maybe they went to pick
up Dad from the airport.

53:03.909 --> 53:05.582
You got
a big day tomorrow.

53:05.661 --> 53:07.538
How about
you get sleep?

53:19.133 --> 53:20.806
Oh, my God, dude.

53:20.885 --> 53:22.432
Look at that,
motherfucker.

53:22.511 --> 53:23.979
You look like
a commercial, dude.

53:27.141 --> 53:29.644
No. You want me in?
You want me in?

53:29.727 --> 53:31.149
If you want me in,
I'm coming in.

53:45.868 --> 53:47.962
What the fuck?

53:54.209 --> 53:55.961
Hey!

53:56.045 --> 53:58.548
Everyone out.

53:58.631 --> 54:01.384
Hey, sister. Hey, come on in.
Come on.

54:01.467 --> 54:05.392
This water's perfect.
The PH is fucking balanced.

54:05.471 --> 54:08.065
- Everyone out!
- Louisa!

54:09.934 --> 54:12.813
They don't speak English.
The don't speak.

54:15.189 --> 54:18.159
Maldito. Andale.

54:22.112 --> 54:23.614
Just one second.

54:24.782 --> 54:25.999
Louisa, thank you.

54:31.789 --> 54:33.883
You know
I cooked tonight?

54:33.958 --> 54:36.507
I haven't cooked
in years.

54:36.585 --> 54:38.929
That means I'm a good influence.

54:39.004 --> 54:41.348
No, you're under the influence.
Always.

54:41.423 --> 54:43.345
And I want you out
of here tonight.

54:43.424 --> 54:45.677
I don't care if you're sorry.
You're a selfish asshole.

54:45.760 --> 54:48.013
You just show up
out of nowhere,

54:48.096 --> 54:50.940
you pump yourself full of drugs and
alcohol, and you do shit like this?

54:51.015 --> 54:52.767
No, I am not
putting up with this.

54:52.850 --> 54:54.477
All we were doing
is swimming.

54:54.560 --> 54:57.109
Look at yourself!

54:57.188 --> 54:59.941
You were given everything, and
you just pissed it all away.

55:00.024 --> 55:03.949
You could have had a career. You could
have had a family. You could have had me.

55:04.028 --> 55:07.123
And instead you're
just a fucking mess!

55:11.828 --> 55:13.671
Your life,

55:13.746 --> 55:16.465
or ignoring
your kids,

55:16.541 --> 55:18.714
and fucking
my brother is--

55:18.793 --> 55:20.921
Oh.

55:24.215 --> 55:26.092
Katherine, wait.

55:26.175 --> 55:28.428
I didn't mean
any of that.

55:28.511 --> 55:31.731
I'm-I'm just trying.
Come on.

55:52.744 --> 55:54.462
For every country.

55:54.537 --> 55:56.289
You guys are great.

55:56.372 --> 55:58.500
Hey, how are you?

55:58.583 --> 56:00.836
I'll be back.

56:00.918 --> 56:04.968
Hey, it's a private party. There's a VIP party.
I'm gonna go in there.

56:05.048 --> 56:07.142
What, are you going
to play keno?

56:07.216 --> 56:11.938
Okay. We actually had a big business
deal that went really well.

56:12.013 --> 56:13.356
How big was that?

56:13.431 --> 56:15.183
You know,
it was worth--

56:15.266 --> 56:17.519
- How are you doing?
- Having a good time?

56:17.602 --> 56:19.821
- Sorry?
- A good time.

56:19.896 --> 56:21.648
- Are you having one?
- Yeah.

56:21.731 --> 56:23.483
How is it going?
William.

56:31.032 --> 56:33.080
- Hey, Dana.
- Hey.

56:33.159 --> 56:35.412
I haven't seen you
since the table.

56:35.495 --> 56:37.668
You got this whole
thing started.

56:37.747 --> 56:39.920
- Great roll, man.
- Thank you.

56:39.999 --> 56:42.093
I didn't know you had so
many friends in Shreveport.

56:42.168 --> 56:44.717
Yeah, actually
I didn't, either.

56:44.796 --> 56:46.594
Judy, open up.

58:09.337 --> 58:11.840
This is William. Can't come
to the phone right now,

58:11.923 --> 58:15.143
so please leave a message and
I'll call you back. Thank you.

58:15.218 --> 58:18.392
Hi, it's me.

58:19.556 --> 58:21.604
It's really late.

58:21.683 --> 58:24.903
You're probably fast asleep.

58:39.201 --> 58:40.953
Come here.

59:02.306 --> 59:04.024
Shit.

59:06.185 --> 59:08.062
I'll go get
another one.

59:08.145 --> 59:09.988
Hold on.

59:10.064 --> 59:11.907
Okay, go get
another one.

59:23.661 --> 59:25.538
Fucking key.

59:32.586 --> 59:33.963
Evening.

59:41.303 --> 59:44.898
Hi, it's me.

59:44.974 --> 59:47.773
It's really late.

59:47.851 --> 59:50.525
You're probably fast asleep.

59:50.604 --> 59:53.608
Just calling to congratulate
you on the deal.

59:55.276 --> 59:57.620
Can't wait to hear
all about it.

59:59.863 --> 01:00:02.036
That's all, I guess.

01:00:02.116 --> 01:00:03.709
I miss you.

01:01:05.970 --> 01:01:07.597
Good morning, everyone.

01:01:11.017 --> 01:01:14.112
Where's Uncle Scott?
He's not in his room.

01:01:14.187 --> 01:01:15.780
Charles, sit down.

01:01:15.855 --> 01:01:19.325
Where is Moose?

01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:22.700
Your Uncle Scott left in
the middle of the night.

01:01:24.655 --> 01:01:29.035
He'll be back. He promised
me he would help me today.

01:01:29.118 --> 01:01:32.588
He left. I-I don't think
he's coming back.

01:01:32.663 --> 01:01:35.963
He will.
You don't know that?

01:01:36.042 --> 01:01:38.261
Maybe.

01:01:38.336 --> 01:01:42.057
He will!
You watch.

01:01:47.970 --> 01:01:50.314
I'm going to kill him,
I swear to God.

01:02:46.988 --> 01:02:49.036
You want a ride?

01:02:53.202 --> 01:02:56.581
You can sit
up front.

01:03:00.001 --> 01:03:03.301
Your Uncle Scott is old like,
you know, me and your dad.

01:03:03.379 --> 01:03:06.928
But he's still got a lot of
growing up to do, like you guys.

01:03:07.007 --> 01:03:09.681
I don't think Uncle Scott
knows how to grow up.

01:03:12.512 --> 01:03:15.436
Maybe it was my fault
Uncle Scott left.

01:03:15.515 --> 01:03:17.734
I did pressure him.

01:03:17.809 --> 01:03:20.653
Don't you ever
think that.

01:03:27.611 --> 01:03:29.488
Don't crowd
him too much.

01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:34.998
Uncle Scott.

01:03:36.495 --> 01:03:37.963
Hey, man,
come here.

01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:42.042
Can you watch
my horse for me?

01:03:44.211 --> 01:03:46.634
Hey...

01:03:46.713 --> 01:03:50.513
I decided to get here early and
cut through all the red tape.

01:03:54.679 --> 01:03:57.478
And these
are for you.

01:03:57.557 --> 01:04:00.060
I'm sorry
about last night.

01:04:00.143 --> 01:04:02.737
I was kind
of A-hole.

01:04:04.856 --> 01:04:08.326
You ready to do this,
big man? Yeah?

01:04:08.401 --> 01:04:09.948
All right,
go get them.

01:04:12.197 --> 01:04:15.792
Hey, Charles,
come here.

01:04:15.867 --> 01:04:18.791
I want to give you this.
for good luck.

01:04:18.870 --> 01:04:20.747
It's called a "ku".

01:04:20.830 --> 01:04:22.582
A fisherman
gave it to me.

01:04:22.666 --> 01:04:25.886
It's kinda like a Mayan
ying yang thing.

01:04:27.045 --> 01:04:28.718
Go get them, dude.

01:04:31.550 --> 01:04:34.019
Last up today
is Charles Henderson.

01:04:34.094 --> 01:04:37.394
He'll be giving
a report on the Aztecs.

01:04:38.598 --> 01:04:39.724
Charles?

01:04:51.319 --> 01:04:52.821
We--

01:04:52.904 --> 01:04:57.330
We all know
the Aztecs ruled

01:04:57.409 --> 01:04:59.958
all of Mexico

01:05:00.036 --> 01:05:04.337
before Cortes conquered
them in 1533.

01:05:06.710 --> 01:05:09.463
Mexico City t-today

01:05:09.546 --> 01:05:14.301
stands on the ruins of the
Aztec capital, Tenochtitlan.

01:05:16.969 --> 01:05:19.848
And the Aztecs were a
highly advanced empire

01:05:19.930 --> 01:05:22.183
that reigned
for 300 years

01:05:22.266 --> 01:05:25.691
over a nation larger
than the United States,

01:05:25.769 --> 01:05:29.273
with the capital twice
the size of London.

01:05:31.275 --> 01:05:33.323
But what most
people don't know

01:05:33.402 --> 01:05:37.327
know is the way the Aztec nation
reigned over so many people,

01:05:37.406 --> 01:05:40.034
was that they would capture
anyone who opposed them,

01:05:40.117 --> 01:05:42.711
and sacrifice them
to the gods.

01:05:47.249 --> 01:05:50.469
So, what they did was they
would take a conquistador,

01:05:50.544 --> 01:05:52.797
and each priest would
get an arm or leg,

01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:56.009
and they would stretch
him out over this rock,

01:05:56.091 --> 01:05:59.561
and the high priest would take this
flint, this really sharp rock,

01:05:59.637 --> 01:06:01.639
and he would hold it
above his head,

01:06:01.722 --> 01:06:03.599
in front
of the Aztec nation,

01:06:03.682 --> 01:06:06.606
and he would slam it right
through the breast bone.

01:06:09.313 --> 01:06:11.657
And he would reach
into the Spaniard's chest

01:06:11.732 --> 01:06:13.530
and he would
rip out the heart.

01:06:16.153 --> 01:06:17.951
And he would
hold it out

01:06:18.030 --> 01:06:21.330
in front of the whole Aztec
nation, still bleeding.

01:06:21.408 --> 01:06:24.628
And he would scream
"To the Gods".

01:06:32.002 --> 01:06:36.178
But none of that is in any
of the history books.

01:06:36.256 --> 01:06:39.055
They don't
teach that to kids.

01:06:39.134 --> 01:06:42.889
So, it just goes to show that
sometimes history is remembered

01:06:42.971 --> 01:06:45.269
the way grown ups
wished it happened.

01:06:45.349 --> 01:06:50.446
And sometimes the truth just
gets buried with the past.

01:06:50.521 --> 01:06:51.943
That's my boy.

01:07:18.047 --> 01:07:20.891
Here you go.
Keep the change.

01:07:20.967 --> 01:07:23.220
I appreciate it.
Thanks.

01:07:44.323 --> 01:07:47.372
- Hey, how are you doing, Louisa?
- Good.

01:07:47.452 --> 01:07:49.125
Where's Katherine?

01:07:49.439 --> 01:07:52.218
- She went to Charles' assembly.
- Oh, okay.

01:07:52.253 --> 01:07:54.793
- How are doing?
- I'm good. Thank you.

01:07:56.252 --> 01:07:58.254
What the--

01:07:58.337 --> 01:08:00.806
Do you--

01:08:00.882 --> 01:08:04.352
Do you-do you know
anything about the--

01:08:04.427 --> 01:08:07.397
Okay, guys, wash up your hands.
They'll be here soon.

01:08:13.811 --> 01:08:17.314
So, why is there a goddamn
horse in the back yard?

01:08:19.066 --> 01:08:21.615
Hey, Willie.
How have you been?

01:08:23.446 --> 01:08:25.573
That horse, Moose,
is mine actually.

01:08:25.656 --> 01:08:27.908
And I was thinking about giving
it to your boy, Charles.

01:08:27.992 --> 01:08:29.993
What are you do--

01:08:30.077 --> 01:08:32.330
He just showed up a couple of days.
Why don't you ask him?

01:08:32.412 --> 01:08:34.586
- They're here.
- Your father's here.

01:08:34.665 --> 01:08:36.542
What's he doing here?

01:08:36.626 --> 01:08:38.627
I told you. He's coming
over for dinner for your--

01:08:38.711 --> 01:08:42.136
No. Actually, you haven't told
me a lot of things lately.

01:08:44.050 --> 01:08:46.849
Hello, Pappy.

01:08:46.928 --> 01:08:48.225
Hello.

01:08:51.724 --> 01:08:53.725
Hey, Dad.
How are doing?

01:08:56.979 --> 01:08:58.104
Pa.

01:08:58.189 --> 01:09:00.408
Oh. Good to see you.

01:09:00.483 --> 01:09:03.703
- Dinner's almost ready.
- Dad, you must be starving.

01:09:03.778 --> 01:09:05.951
- Where's Joe?
- Who's Joe?

01:09:06.029 --> 01:09:09.250
He's been talking all day about
playing bridge with his friend Joe.

01:09:09.325 --> 01:09:12.249
How can he play bridge
if he's so sick?

01:09:12.328 --> 01:09:14.877
Is Joe your
imaginary friend?

01:09:18.667 --> 01:09:20.170
No smoking
in the house.

01:09:20.252 --> 01:09:22.505
So?

01:09:25.006 --> 01:09:26.929
This family's fucked.

01:09:34.850 --> 01:09:36.898
No shit.

01:09:36.977 --> 01:09:39.604
I've been saying that for years.

01:09:39.688 --> 01:09:42.407
Hey, do me
un favor, pequeno.

01:09:42.482 --> 01:09:46.157
Don't tell them
I speak Inglés.

01:09:46.236 --> 01:09:47.863
I got you.

01:09:47.946 --> 01:09:49.368
Gracias.

01:10:02.586 --> 01:10:05.715
George, how about
you sit over here?

01:10:08.592 --> 01:10:10.219
I'm not sitting here.

01:10:10.343 --> 01:10:12.766
- Oh, come on, Mr. Henderson.
- Where's Joe?

01:10:12.846 --> 01:10:15.850
I'm sure Joe will be here any minute.
Now, come on, have a seat.

01:10:19.728 --> 01:10:21.355
How about
you sit here?

01:10:21.438 --> 01:10:23.486
Ah, nice.

01:10:23.565 --> 01:10:26.990
Charles, would you just
sit down, please? Thanks.

01:10:27.068 --> 01:10:29.196
Welcome
to the family.

01:10:29.279 --> 01:10:32.249
I'd like to propose a toast

01:10:32.324 --> 01:10:36.249
to the two people who are
the reason we're all here,

01:10:36.328 --> 01:10:38.330
- George and Margaret.
- Here, here.

01:10:38.413 --> 01:10:41.087
Well, I think we should
say thank you to Kathy.

01:10:41.166 --> 01:10:44.010
I have to say it's
very generous of you

01:10:44.085 --> 01:10:46.759
to prepare this dinner
in honor of our parents--

01:10:46.838 --> 01:10:49.808
Why did you even
come here?

01:10:49.883 --> 01:10:52.056
Mom told me to come,
back in Tennessee.

01:10:52.135 --> 01:10:54.433
Sorry, come again?

01:10:56.556 --> 01:10:59.150
To be honest, she
wanted me to come here

01:10:59.225 --> 01:11:00.977
and make amends
with you.

01:11:01.061 --> 01:11:03.484
Get to know Charles
and Gracie, see Dad.

01:11:03.563 --> 01:11:06.066
She gave me a whole
list of things,

01:11:06.149 --> 01:11:10.074
and I got on my horse
and here I am.

01:11:10.153 --> 01:11:12.497
Here to make
peace with you.

01:11:12.572 --> 01:11:15.325
Excuse me, everybody,
I'm not gonna get any--

01:11:15.408 --> 01:11:18.833
Hey, hey.
William, sit down.

01:11:27.253 --> 01:11:33.510
Mr. Henderson, why don't you read
from Mrs. Henderson's journal?

01:11:33.592 --> 01:11:35.219
I marked the page.

01:11:35.302 --> 01:11:37.646
Go ahead.

01:11:37.721 --> 01:11:39.064
Read what
the missus wrote.

01:11:45.688 --> 01:11:47.361
It's okay.

01:11:48.774 --> 01:11:51.744
Beautiful flowers.

01:11:51.819 --> 01:11:53.913
"I arrived
at the house today,

01:11:53.988 --> 01:11:57.492
"and found William
and Katherine.

01:11:57.574 --> 01:12:02.000
"They really do make
such a fine couple.

01:12:04.915 --> 01:12:08.215
"William once
said to me

01:12:08.293 --> 01:12:11.672
"that he knew
Katherine was the one

01:12:11.755 --> 01:12:15.350
"the first time Scott
brought her home.

01:12:15.426 --> 01:12:20.273
"It's a very odd place
to be as a mother,

01:12:20.347 --> 01:12:24.693
"having both sons be in
love with the same woman.

01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:28.193
"I think

01:12:30.024 --> 01:12:32.447
"about Scott

01:12:32.526 --> 01:12:34.949
"all the time.

01:12:36.655 --> 01:12:38.623
"It's my greatest hope

01:12:38.699 --> 01:12:42.294
"William and Scott
will make up

01:12:42.369 --> 01:12:44.838
"and be brothers again.

01:12:44.913 --> 01:12:47.757
"And love each other.

01:12:51.253 --> 01:12:53.176
"Scott reminds me

01:12:53.255 --> 01:12:57.601
"so much of his father.

01:12:57.676 --> 01:13:00.680
"I h-hope they

01:13:02.056 --> 01:13:03.774
"reconnect

01:13:03.849 --> 01:13:08.525
"while our
George is still

01:13:10.397 --> 01:13:12.570
George."

01:13:18.906 --> 01:13:20.579
Oh.

01:13:21.700 --> 01:13:23.168
Scott?

01:13:27.748 --> 01:13:29.500
I'll be back.

01:14:04.242 --> 01:14:05.960
He's ready.

01:14:49.287 --> 01:14:51.506
Dad, Dad!

01:14:51.581 --> 01:14:53.379
Charles.

01:14:53.457 --> 01:14:56.586
Call the ambulance!
Katherine, call the ambulance!

01:14:56.669 --> 01:15:00.219
Scott. Scott. Scott.
Do you hear me?

01:15:00.298 --> 01:15:02.801
Scott. Jesus. Hurry!

01:15:02.884 --> 01:15:05.228
Scott.
Come on, Scott.

01:15:18.649 --> 01:15:20.447
- Mr. Henderson?
- Yeah.

01:15:20.526 --> 01:15:23.450
May I, please,
see you a moment?

01:15:23.529 --> 01:15:25.702
What's happened?
Is he okay?

01:15:25.823 --> 01:15:29.123
- He's stable, but he's in a level three coma.
- What does that mean?

01:15:29.202 --> 01:15:32.957
Was it an overdose?
He has a history of drug abuse.

01:15:33.039 --> 01:15:35.633
Uh, your brother
never told you

01:15:35.708 --> 01:15:39.428
he was being treated in
Tennessee for a glioblastoma?

01:15:41.546 --> 01:15:43.264
A type of brain tumor.

01:15:44.716 --> 01:15:46.434
Wait a second. What?

01:15:46.509 --> 01:15:49.388
They found it a year
ago during a routine MRI.

01:15:49.471 --> 01:15:51.894
Because it's
a spectrum of symptoms,

01:15:51.973 --> 01:15:56.854
everything from intense
migraines to hallucinations.

01:15:56.937 --> 01:15:58.985
I'm surprised
he's lasted this long.

01:15:59.064 --> 01:16:02.364
He's going into oncology
for a CAT scan.

01:16:02.442 --> 01:16:04.945
You can probably
see him tomorrow.

01:16:07.280 --> 01:16:11.160
# Precious memories

01:16:11.243 --> 01:16:14.668
# How they linger

01:16:14.746 --> 01:16:17.966
# Precious memories

01:16:18.041 --> 01:16:21.261
# Flood my soul

01:16:22.587 --> 01:16:26.467
# In the stillness

01:16:26.549 --> 01:16:30.474
# Of the midnight

01:16:30.553 --> 01:16:36.276
# Precious sacred
scenes unfold

01:16:38.353 --> 01:16:42.358
# Precious father

01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:46.070
# Loving mother

01:16:46.152 --> 01:16:51.909
# fly across
the lonely years #

01:16:54.786 --> 01:16:56.163
Hi.

01:16:56.246 --> 01:16:59.341
- Does he have a name?
- Moose.

01:16:59.416 --> 01:17:01.214
Moose.

01:17:03.712 --> 01:17:05.806
He's a good
looking horse.

01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:07.974
Are you and mom
getting a divorce?

01:17:08.049 --> 01:17:10.677
Hey, why would you
ask me that?

01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:12.728
Mom's always busy.

01:17:12.804 --> 01:17:16.229
You're always working
late or out of town.

01:17:16.308 --> 01:17:20.313
This usually indicates the
involvement of a third party.

01:17:21.938 --> 01:17:25.442
Um, well,

01:17:25.525 --> 01:17:29.746
maybe, maybe I've just
lost track a little bit.

01:17:31.489 --> 01:17:33.537
You know what
we're going to do?

01:17:33.616 --> 01:17:35.744
You and me?

01:17:35.827 --> 01:17:39.047
We're going to build Moose here a
great stable to live in, okay?

01:17:39.122 --> 01:17:40.999
How does that sound?

01:18:44.353 --> 01:18:46.401
"After five days
of rain,

01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:48.653
"the sun
is finally shining.

01:18:50.526 --> 01:18:53.154
"George and I had dinner
with Katherine and William,

01:18:53.237 --> 01:18:56.411
"and baby Charles
last night.

01:18:56.490 --> 01:18:59.460
"They gave us
wonderful news.

01:18:59.535 --> 01:19:03.165
"I'm going to be
a grandmother again.

01:19:03.247 --> 01:19:05.170
"I remember the day

01:19:05.249 --> 01:19:09.425
"when Katherine said she
was pregnant with Charles.

01:19:09.503 --> 01:19:12.973
"It brought so much
joy to our family.

01:19:13.048 --> 01:19:16.302
"We threw all the
calendars out the window.

01:19:16.385 --> 01:19:18.387
"Even though

01:19:18.470 --> 01:19:21.269
"the time Katherine
last saw Scott

01:19:21.348 --> 01:19:24.773
"and started
seeing William,

01:19:24.852 --> 01:19:27.947
"it was only the
difference of a few weeks.

01:19:31.066 --> 01:19:36.869
"Katherine was my
second son's first love

01:19:36.947 --> 01:19:39.291
"and my first
son's true love.

01:19:42.077 --> 01:19:43.829
"Charles was born

01:19:45.372 --> 01:19:47.795
"nine months
after Scott left.

01:19:49.251 --> 01:19:51.878
"Our family
never mentions this.

01:19:54.422 --> 01:19:56.595
"If you don't say it out loud,

01:19:58.384 --> 01:20:00.807
then it's not true."

01:20:32.668 --> 01:20:35.842
Hey, sorry, I just got your message.
Is everything okay?

01:20:35.922 --> 01:20:37.595
Yeah, everything's fine.

01:20:37.673 --> 01:20:40.176
He and the kids are in
the den with Viola.

01:20:40.259 --> 01:20:41.886
Okay.

01:20:44.514 --> 01:20:46.892
My mom's journals?

01:20:46.974 --> 01:20:50.945
She paints our stories
so beautifully.

01:20:51.020 --> 01:20:52.897
Makes us all
seem so together.

01:20:52.980 --> 01:20:54.948
Yeah.

01:20:56.609 --> 01:20:59.362
So, Scott has another
CAT scan tomorrow,

01:20:59.445 --> 01:21:03.541
and I had Andy put a call into
the specialist in Houston and--

01:21:03.616 --> 01:21:05.789
He sent me
a plane ticket.

01:21:12.583 --> 01:21:16.759
It was right after we
said, "I love you"

01:21:16.837 --> 01:21:19.215
for the first time.

01:21:20.883 --> 01:21:24.478
If was like he knew
or felt' that

01:21:24.554 --> 01:21:26.727
I moved on.

01:21:29.475 --> 01:21:31.648
I never told you.

01:21:33.145 --> 01:21:35.489
Because he was too late.

01:21:37.608 --> 01:21:39.906
I was right
where I wanted to be.

01:21:41.737 --> 01:21:43.114
I should go check
on the kids.

01:21:43.197 --> 01:21:44.744
Hold on a minute.

01:21:52.081 --> 01:21:54.209
I miss you.

01:21:58.044 --> 01:21:59.967
I love you.

01:22:01.756 --> 01:22:03.679
I love you, too.

01:22:06.177 --> 01:22:09.431
Ana' the tags poking up out of
the back of your dad's jacket.

01:22:09.514 --> 01:22:11.357
It was our
first date.

01:22:11.433 --> 01:22:14.607
You had me so nervous I
was all discombobulated.

01:22:14.686 --> 01:22:20.238
And all I wanted to do was
just be home with you.

01:22:21.818 --> 01:22:23.820
- You know.
- Yeah.

01:22:26.448 --> 01:22:29.327
I just want to be us again.

01:22:31.119 --> 01:22:33.167
- You know?
- I do.

01:22:42.589 --> 01:22:45.263
"I don't know how
a person is supposed to act

they love dies.

"I guess everyone reacts
in different ways.

01:22:50.805 --> 01:22:53.149
"I was lucky enough
to know Uncle Scott

01:22:53.224 --> 01:22:55.602
"for a grand total
of four days.

01:22:55.685 --> 01:22:58.655
"And here's how
I'd sum him up

"in three lines.

"He was a fire
bellied toad

became a prince for a day."
