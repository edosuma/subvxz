00:01.910 --> 00:05.129
(birds chirping)

00:15.850 --> 00:18.075
-Shh, shh, shh.
-Okay, crazy alert.

00:18.077 --> 00:19.501
Right in this store
behind us--right here--

00:19.503 --> 00:22.763
is one pair of Nike Vaporfly
Elite Flyprint 3D sneakers.

00:22.765 --> 00:24.097
Can you believe it?

00:24.099 --> 00:26.341
The exact same shoes
that Tony Hawk wears

00:26.343 --> 00:29.269
to walk his dogs are sitting
on a shelf right now

00:29.271 --> 00:30.696
between a pair
of orthopedic nurses' shoes

00:30.698 --> 00:33.014
and those sandal things

00:33.016 --> 00:34.258
that old ladies
can fit their feet into

00:34.260 --> 00:35.759
if they have hammer toes.
Well, hey--

00:35.761 --> 00:37.944
They came in the bottom of
a box of socks into the store.

00:37.946 --> 00:39.204
<i> -SHRUB: Yeah.</i>
<i> -KELLY: Total mistake.</i>

00:39.206 --> 00:41.281
<i> SHRUB: Those shoes are worth,</i>
<i> like, $2,000.</i>

00:41.283 --> 00:42.949
<i> KELLY: Guess how much Mr.</i>
<i> Perkins is selling them for?</i>

00:42.951 --> 00:44.543
<i> $100.</i>

00:44.545 --> 00:48.363
<i> All we need is $100 and we'll</i>
<i> be walking like the Hawk-King.</i>

00:48.365 --> 00:50.698
<i> And Shrub and I wear</i>
<i> the exact same size shoe,</i>

00:50.700 --> 00:52.959
<i> so we're gonna switch off</i>
<i> wearing them every other day.</i>

00:52.961 --> 00:54.111
-My God!
-MR. PERKINS: Shoo! get out!

00:54.113 --> 00:55.295
And don't come back!

00:55.297 --> 00:59.116
-You're a wicked man.
-Wait! Where's my shoe?

00:59.118 --> 01:01.785
Perkins!
My shoe is still in there.

01:01.787 --> 01:04.730
You stole my shoe!

01:04.732 --> 01:06.139
What the hell?

01:06.141 --> 01:09.902
Oh, ew, ew!
I stepped in old man spit!

01:09.904 --> 01:11.219
Oh!

01:11.221 --> 01:14.314
<i> KELLY: I stepped</i>
<i> in old man spit, oh!</i>

01:14.316 --> 01:16.800
-Gettin' our garage sale on!
-Hey, hey!

01:16.802 --> 01:18.302
We're gonna make a fortune.

01:18.304 --> 01:20.079
We brought out all
our best stuff, so come on in.

01:20.081 --> 01:22.397
Check it out.
Super cute.

01:22.399 --> 01:23.473
These were my best friends
growin' up,

01:23.475 --> 01:24.975
so gonna make some kid
really happy.

01:24.977 --> 01:28.069
Don't touch that!
Put it down!

01:28.071 --> 01:29.980
Okay, everyone under
seven, out!

01:29.982 --> 01:30.997
-SHRUB: Get out!
-Not allowed! Not allowed!

01:30.999 --> 01:33.817
SHRUB: Go, go, go, go, go!

01:33.819 --> 01:36.169
Hey, how much is this?

01:36.171 --> 01:40.006
Oh, you have very good taste,
my friend.

01:40.008 --> 01:42.159
<i> I went through a pirate phase</i>
<i> in high school</i>

01:42.161 --> 01:43.418
after Kelly and I
watched, like,

01:43.420 --> 01:45.162
a<i> Pirates of the Caribbean</i>
marathon.

01:45.164 --> 01:46.772
I-I dressed up like
Jack Sparrow for a while.

01:46.774 --> 01:48.941
But, uh, then, like,

01:48.943 --> 01:50.776
a bunch of jocks beat me up

01:50.778 --> 01:52.185
for wearing mascara.

01:52.187 --> 01:54.780
Um, yeah, but during that time,

01:54.782 --> 01:56.264
I was able to make a bunch

01:56.266 --> 01:57.932
of treasure maps of our town.

01:57.934 --> 02:01.328
"Yar lies Colonel Flatch's
treasure of gold."

02:01.864 --> 02:04.030
I-is this real?

02:04.032 --> 02:06.016
(clears throat)
Hell yeah.

02:06.018 --> 02:07.459
Did you ever dig up
the treasure?

02:07.461 --> 02:08.943
No, Levi,

02:08.945 --> 02:10.945
I-I'm a very busy guy.

02:10.947 --> 02:12.297
Can I buy the map?

02:12.299 --> 02:14.524
I'll give you $5.
It's my whole allowance.

02:14.526 --> 02:17.261
Friggin' sold, my man!
Happy hunting!

02:21.367 --> 02:23.308
I'll give you 10 cents
for the cat.

02:23.310 --> 02:26.052
[bleep], Len.
Okay, this is pure china.

02:26.054 --> 02:27.962
It says China
on the bottom, even.

02:27.964 --> 02:31.057
Also, there's sentimental
value there, so 20 bucks.

02:31.059 --> 02:33.560
Forget it.
I hate cats anyway.

02:33.562 --> 02:36.897
I just wanted something
to prop open the bathroom door.

02:36.899 --> 02:38.064
BOTH: Ew.

02:38.066 --> 02:39.849
Cats rule, okay?

02:39.851 --> 02:40.409
And normal people close
the door

02:41.737 --> 02:43.144
They don't prop it open,
disgusto!

02:43.146 --> 02:44.312
Ever thought
that's why you live alone?

02:44.314 --> 02:45.980
Start closing the door
when you do gross stuff!

02:45.982 --> 02:48.000
Um, I got another email
from Jimmy

02:48.002 --> 02:49.484
over at the<i> Pockton Gazette.</i>

02:49.486 --> 02:51.003
Another riddle.

02:51.005 --> 02:55.465
"What do you get when you cross
two rival newspaper editors?"

02:57.494 --> 03:01.329
(stammering) Do you think
that means he's asking me out?

03:01.331 --> 03:03.907
'Cause I think he might be.

03:03.909 --> 03:05.166
Or it's a death threat.

03:05.168 --> 03:08.687
Ah, it's so hard
to tell these days!

03:11.508 --> 03:12.507
-(knock at door)
-BIG MANDY: Hey.

03:12.693 --> 03:14.842
You need to make the font
on the paper bigger.

03:14.844 --> 03:16.028
I lost my reading glasses

03:16.030 --> 03:17.845
and I don't want
to buy another pair.

03:17.847 --> 03:19.756
(laughs)
Hi, Mandy. What's up?

03:19.758 --> 03:21.425
I just told you.

03:21.427 --> 03:24.110
-Oh, is that why you came by?
-Yeah.

03:24.112 --> 03:26.613
Oh, wait.
Can I ask you a question?

03:26.615 --> 03:30.191
Hey, I--are you single?

03:30.193 --> 03:32.377
I'm flattered,
but I don't do redheads.

03:32.379 --> 03:35.121
-Y'all are bad luck.
-CHERYL: What? No.

03:35.123 --> 03:37.107
Um, look, there's this guy
who's been emailing me,

03:37.109 --> 03:39.943
and I think he might want
to ask me out.

03:39.945 --> 03:42.870
But, um, I'm not really sure

03:42.872 --> 03:44.297
if I'm ready
to start dating again.

03:44.299 --> 03:46.450
Listen, just shut
that all down.

03:46.452 --> 03:48.118
Get out there!
You're at your peak.

03:48.120 --> 03:50.303
I get it.
It ain't easy.

03:50.305 --> 03:52.456
The men, and even some of
the women I've got my eye on,

03:52.458 --> 03:53.640
they think I'm out
of their league.

03:53.642 --> 03:55.959
They are correct.

03:55.961 --> 03:57.218
But they're intimidated
by my wit

03:57.220 --> 04:00.054
and my sexy charm, you know?

04:00.056 --> 04:01.982
It ain't easy bein'
a smart woman these days.

04:01.984 --> 04:03.633
Yeah, I hear ya.

04:03.635 --> 04:05.244
You see, you and me,

04:05.246 --> 04:08.972
we're a couple of filet mignons
in a town of hamburgers.

04:08.974 --> 04:10.640
(laughs)

04:10.642 --> 04:13.752
And see, that's the type of wit
that scares 'em off!

04:13.754 --> 04:14.995
You get it!
Come on, you get it!

04:14.997 --> 04:17.422
Come on! Yeah!

04:17.424 --> 04:18.665
Strong!
(laughs)

04:18.759 --> 04:21.075
Back at ya, professor.
Yeah, you stay strong too.

04:21.077 --> 04:23.262
Garage sale
was a bit of a bust.

04:23.264 --> 04:25.097
So I'm taking it on the road.

04:25.099 --> 04:27.674
Father Joe is totally gonna
want to buy this Bible

04:27.676 --> 04:30.844
that my dad stole from a motel
when he was in Cincinnati.

04:30.846 --> 04:33.772
<i> (jazzy music)</i>

04:33.774 --> 04:38.944
<i> ♪ </i>

04:38.946 --> 04:40.762
Worst party ever.

04:40.764 --> 04:45.433
<i> ♪ </i>

04:45.435 --> 04:48.862
All right. Nice work, Mandy.
That's right.

04:48.864 --> 04:50.363
Ope!
Don't wanna over-twirl though.

04:50.365 --> 04:53.625
Okay? Use your flourishes
to accentuate, not dominate.

04:53.627 --> 04:55.777
Really important.

04:55.779 --> 04:58.297
What the [bleep]?

04:59.633 --> 05:01.224
<i> Yeah.</i>

05:01.226 --> 05:03.451
There's still a spark
between me and Dylan.

05:03.453 --> 05:06.196
I guess you could say that kiss
we shared in grade school

05:06.198 --> 05:09.049
was more powerful than either
of us dares to admit.

05:09.051 --> 05:10.958
I've been told my kisses
are electric.

05:10.960 --> 05:12.060
(kisses)

05:14.206 --> 05:16.056
You won't believe
what I was last Halloween.

05:16.058 --> 05:17.390
What the hell?

05:17.392 --> 05:18.800
Oh, Kelly.

05:18.802 --> 05:20.802
We don't use that kind of
language in the Lord's house.

05:20.804 --> 05:22.470
You let Nadine
start a dance class?

05:22.472 --> 05:25.048
-In the community room?
-Yes. She asked me

05:25.050 --> 05:27.050
if she could, and I said that I
thought that was a great idea.

05:27.052 --> 05:27.993
I asked you two months ago

05:27.995 --> 05:30.387
if I could start
a fight club in there,

05:30.389 --> 05:32.497
and you said no.
How's that fair?

05:32.499 --> 05:35.334
Kelly, there's a lot
of seniors in our church,

05:35.336 --> 05:38.653
and I think that dance is good
for their body and their soul.

05:38.655 --> 05:40.230
Much more so than fighting.

05:40.232 --> 05:41.581
I just can't believe
you would take my dream

05:41.583 --> 05:43.675
of starting a dance school
and give it away to Nadine,

05:43.677 --> 05:44.992
like it's a piece
of crappy Halloween candy.

05:44.994 --> 05:46.252
I literally had no idea

05:46.254 --> 05:48.329
you wanted to start
a dance studio.

05:48.331 --> 05:50.240
I've never seen you dance.

05:50.242 --> 05:51.183
I don't think I've ever
even seen you run.

05:51.185 --> 05:52.834
Well then, watch this.

05:52.836 --> 05:56.596
Kelly! Hey!

05:56.598 --> 05:57.747
Would you like
to join my dance class?

05:57.749 --> 05:58.932
I know you don't have
any money,

05:59.084 --> 06:01.585
but I'd be more than happy
to waive the $10 fee.

06:01.587 --> 06:03.269
-No big.
-No, Nadine.

06:03.271 --> 06:04.921
I do not wish to join
your very stupid dance class.

06:04.923 --> 06:07.440
Okay? Because I already know
how to dance and really well.

06:07.442 --> 06:09.618
And don't act like
you don't know that.

06:11.354 --> 06:13.263
When I was a kid,
I was a ballerina.

06:13.265 --> 06:14.373
I actually had mad skills.

06:14.375 --> 06:17.267
<i> My teacher used</i>
<i> to call me a trooper</i>

06:17.269 --> 06:18.359
<i> because I was</i>
<i> so light on my feet.</i>

06:18.361 --> 06:19.694
<i> Like when</i>
<i> the parachute troopers</i>

06:19.696 --> 06:21.454
<i> are floating down</i>
<i> from the airplanes?</i>

06:21.456 --> 06:23.865
<i> Then Nadine got jealous</i>
<i> and screwed me over.</i>

06:23.867 --> 06:26.443
Basically,
Nadine was the best in class

06:26.445 --> 06:28.369
and always got
the lead solo dance.

06:28.371 --> 06:31.448
And Kelly was always
put in the back row.

06:31.450 --> 06:33.708
<i> Nadine was so good,</i>
<i> she got a standing ovation</i>

06:33.710 --> 06:35.452
<i> on the night of the recital.</i>

06:35.454 --> 06:38.045
<i> And so Kelly tried to top her,</i>

06:38.047 --> 06:41.400
<i> which did not go as planned.</i>

06:41.402 --> 06:44.361
(applause)

06:44.963 --> 06:46.721
(crowd gasps)

06:46.723 --> 06:48.798
After that, I realized
that ballet's dumb.

06:48.800 --> 06:51.151
So I decided to dedicate myself
to the only type of dancing

06:51.153 --> 06:54.371
that really matters: hip-hop.

06:56.324 --> 06:59.918
Hey, quit push--
Ricky, quit pushing.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.253
There's enough for everyone.

07:01.255 --> 07:03.422
Oh, my God, the treasures
are in the ground.

07:03.424 --> 07:05.090
-They're not going anywhere.
-KELLY: Scooch it.

07:05.092 --> 07:06.407
-Give me the money.
-KELLY: Please move.

07:06.409 --> 07:07.759
(overlapping chatter)

07:07.761 --> 07:09.911
-Dude, you made more maps?
-What are you talking about?

07:09.913 --> 07:13.915
No, I found more.

07:13.917 --> 07:15.434
Got it.
Nice, okay.

07:15.436 --> 07:16.993
Well, I'm starting
a hip-hop dance school,

07:16.995 --> 07:18.103
and I need your help.

07:18.105 --> 07:20.513
Sorry, but I have
a rather thriving business

07:20.515 --> 07:21.681
going on right now.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.834
-Why, how much have you made?
-SHRUB: Uh, $120 so far.

07:24.836 --> 07:25.685
So yeah, I might just buy

07:25.929 --> 07:27.279
those shoes for myself,
if you don't mind,

07:27.281 --> 07:29.597
seeing as you haven't
exactly been contributing.

07:29.599 --> 07:31.933
How do you know I'm not gonna
make enough money too?

07:31.935 --> 07:33.193
Uh, I don't know.

07:33.195 --> 07:34.861
'Cause a dance school's
a dumb idea?

07:34.863 --> 07:36.121
You're a dumb idea.

07:37.440 --> 07:37.789
KIDS: Hey!

07:37.791 --> 07:40.274
Mature.

07:40.276 --> 07:41.201
You can have that one. Eddie!

07:41.203 --> 07:45.046
No browsing.
You read it, you buy it.

07:46.692 --> 07:48.282
This is how I start my day.

07:48.284 --> 07:50.385
Let's go take a look
at my babies.

07:52.531 --> 07:54.389
What the fruit?

07:59.796 --> 08:01.980
[bleep].

08:07.229 --> 08:09.988
SHRUB:
You spelled "fresh" wrong.

08:09.990 --> 08:10.897
KELLY:
It's old school spelling.

08:10.899 --> 08:11.898
Heard of it?

08:11.900 --> 08:13.307
Why are you here anyways?

08:13.309 --> 08:15.160
Begging your way back
into my school?

08:15.162 --> 08:17.436
No, I just wanted to see
if you were gonna do it.

08:17.438 --> 08:18.722
I still think it's a dumb idea.

08:18.724 --> 08:22.834
Oh, and by the way, um,
I actually made $160.

08:22.836 --> 08:25.411
So yeah, I'm about
to go buy those shoes.

08:25.413 --> 08:28.398
And then probably, like,
a thousand slushies, so...

08:28.400 --> 08:31.158
Fine. Why don't you go
make out with Nadine

08:31.160 --> 08:32.660
while you're at it,
you little traitor?

08:32.662 --> 08:34.161
(scoffs)

08:34.163 --> 08:36.740
Beth? W-what's up?

08:36.742 --> 08:39.017
I'm here for the hip-hop class.

08:39.019 --> 08:40.927
-Really?
-Yeah, I love dancing.

08:40.929 --> 08:43.263
KELLY: Well, well, well.

08:43.265 --> 08:44.748
I'm really excited to have you

08:44.750 --> 08:48.193
Well, we are happy to have you
be part of our school.

08:48.195 --> 08:52.197
-So let's get our hip-hop on.
-Oh, yeah!

08:52.199 --> 08:54.591
(laughs) Throw your hands up

08:54.593 --> 08:57.093
-(mimics air horn)
-Mickey, why are you here?

08:57.095 --> 08:58.394
Beth told me about the class.

08:58.396 --> 09:00.096
And since I'm always
trying to improve myself,

09:00.098 --> 09:02.189
I thought I'd stop by.

09:02.191 --> 09:03.616
Truth be told,

09:03.618 --> 09:05.268
I was looking to spend
some more time with Beth.

09:05.270 --> 09:07.695
And I know Shrub's
in love with her.

09:07.697 --> 09:10.957
And Shrub is my bro.
So bro code, but still.

09:10.959 --> 09:12.292
Beth is so hot.

09:12.294 --> 09:16.037
Hey, look who I ran into
on my way over here.

09:16.039 --> 09:17.630
June? You like hip-hop?

09:17.632 --> 09:21.226
I'm always interested in ways
to make my hip replacement hop.

09:21.228 --> 09:22.468
SHRUB: (laughs)
That's a corker, June!

09:22.470 --> 09:24.712
KELLY: Okay, well,
I just need $10 from everyone,

09:24.714 --> 09:26.690
and then we can get started.

09:28.902 --> 09:32.128
Hey, Big Mandy.
Are you here to join the class?

09:32.130 --> 09:33.989
No, I'm just watching.

09:35.576 --> 09:36.649
I'm afraid that even

09:36.651 --> 09:38.994
if you're just watching,
you have to pay.

09:45.327 --> 09:47.977
Oh, uh, let's just say
you're auditing the class.

09:47.979 --> 09:49.087
-Yeah, you do that.
-KELLY: Yeah.

09:49.089 --> 09:50.663
I'm on my lunch break.

09:50.665 --> 09:52.816
I usually watch something funny
when I eat

09:52.818 --> 09:54.334
because I read in this
alternative medicine blog

09:54.336 --> 09:58.838
it creates enzymes which helps
aid in my digestion.

09:58.840 --> 10:00.432
Now, I usually watch
<i> The Simpsons</i>

10:00.434 --> 10:02.008
when I eat my meals,

10:02.010 --> 10:02.826

about this class...

10:02.828 --> 10:04.269

10:04.271 --> 10:08.331
I knew it was
gonna be hilarious.

day one with that.

18:06.753 --> 18:08.753
-Oh!
-KELLY: Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

18:08.755 --> 18:09.979
Wow, Dylan!

18:09.981 --> 18:11.981
I have no idea
what happened in there.

18:11.983 --> 18:13.332
I think I blacked out.

18:13.334 --> 18:15.760
Yes!

18:15.762 --> 18:17.595
That was amazing!

18:17.597 --> 18:20.080
Yes! Winner?

18:20.082 --> 18:21.915
<i> -♪ I've got the power </i>
-Winner? Winner?

18:21.917 --> 18:24.176
Winner? Whoo! I won!

18:24.178 --> 18:25.010
NADINE: No, you didn't.
That wasn't a vote.

18:25.105 --> 18:27.588
You just yelled
"winner" a bunch.

18:27.590 --> 18:28.940
Nadine,

18:28.942 --> 18:31.943
you need to realize that dance
shouldn't be a contest.

18:31.945 --> 18:33.778
-Oh.
-Okay?

18:33.780 --> 18:36.114
It is the most scared form

18:36.116 --> 18:39.175
of impressions and spirits.
Okay?

18:39.177 --> 18:40.934
So if you want
to teach your fashion,

18:40.936 --> 18:43.329
your heart needs
to be motivated.

18:45.850 --> 18:48.851
I hereby declare
dance schools dumb!

18:48.853 --> 18:50.002
Mic drop.

18:54.467 --> 18:56.041
Hey, hello?

18:56.043 --> 18:57.026
What the hell, Dylan?

18:57.028 --> 18:59.637
Listen, if you ever break up,

18:59.639 --> 19:01.864
give me a call.

19:01.866 --> 19:03.307
Either one of you.

19:03.309 --> 19:04.559
Oh.

19:07.872 --> 19:09.872
You're pretty.

19:09.874 --> 19:11.056
SHRUB: Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

19:11.058 --> 19:13.058
All around the world.

19:13.060 --> 19:15.135
Pew-pew-pew-pew-pew!

19:15.137 --> 19:17.196
FATHER JOE: Hey, Kelly. Kelly.

19:18.474 --> 19:20.491
You crushed it!

19:21.810 --> 19:24.403
Oh, hey, what do you think?

19:24.405 --> 19:25.571
I needed some new sneaks
and these looked fun.

19:25.573 --> 19:28.148
I paid 100 bucks for 'em.

19:28.150 --> 19:31.060
That's the most I've ever paid
for a pair of shoes.

19:31.062 --> 19:33.487
(laughs)
They're pretty cool, huh?

19:33.489 --> 19:35.080
SHRUB: No!

19:35.917 --> 19:37.066
I thought they were pretty fly!

19:37.068 --> 19:38.067
CAMERA PERSON: Whoa!

19:38.069 --> 19:41.012
Ooh, oh! Are you all right?

19:41.014 --> 19:42.829
Ah, I should have told you
about that hole.

19:42.831 --> 19:44.924
There's a lot of them
around here.

19:44.926 --> 19:46.166
I've always had
really weak ankles.

19:46.186 --> 19:48.744
When I was eight,
I had to quit the soccer team

19:48.746 --> 19:50.671
-because...
-(knock at door)

19:50.673 --> 19:53.357
Oh, I'm sorry.

19:53.359 --> 19:54.358
Ooh!

19:55.862 --> 19:59.488
-Who at this hour?
-(knock at door)

20:02.851 --> 20:04.851
What are you doing here, Joe?

20:04.853 --> 20:08.206
Oh! Hey!
I-I'm sorry to interrupt you.

20:08.208 --> 20:10.625
Um, just thought
I'd bring you some food.

20:12.954 --> 20:14.503
Oh, those are pretty flowers.

20:15.364 --> 20:18.624
Who, uh, who sent them to you?

20:18.626 --> 20:22.202
The editor
at the<i> Pockton Gazette.</i>

20:22.204 --> 20:23.704
Oh.

20:23.706 --> 20:27.040
Cheryl, she's an incredibly
smart person.

20:27.042 --> 20:31.354
And I am really...well, not.

20:33.066 --> 20:36.158
I knew she would get bored
with me

20:36.160 --> 20:38.885
and she'd have to break up
with me.

20:38.887 --> 20:41.388
I just didn't want her
to have to go through that,

20:41.390 --> 20:43.966
so...

20:43.968 --> 20:46.619
I think I made the best
decision for both of us.

20:48.473 --> 20:51.173
Well, you know,
here's your food.

20:51.175 --> 20:54.085
It's hummus, your favorite.

20:56.739 --> 20:58.998
Thanks for bringing me food.
That's very sweet of you.

20:59.000 --> 21:03.986
You can eat hummus,
but you can't eat flowers.

21:03.988 --> 21:05.263
I'll bet the editor

21:05.265 --> 21:08.340
from the<i> Pockton Gazette</i>
didn't know that.

21:08.342 --> 21:10.101
Well...

21:10.103 --> 21:14.397
some flowers
are edible, you know?

21:15.683 --> 21:17.525
You are so smart.

21:23.432 --> 21:25.858
Um...

21:25.860 --> 21:28.435
-Thanks for coming by, Joe.
-I'll see you around, Cheryl.

21:28.437 --> 21:30.079
CHERYL: Yup.
