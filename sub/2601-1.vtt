00:35.785 --> 00:37.036
Hey, babe, what's up?

00:46.629 --> 00:50.090
- What is that?
- Hello, baby.

00:50.258 --> 00:51.592
Hi.

00:52.886 --> 00:55.220
- Is that what I think it is?
- Yes.

00:55.388 --> 00:58.223
I don't know what you think it is,
but whatever it is, it's sweet.

00:58.391 --> 01:02.436
I think it's a giant-ass camera.
What happened to the little handheld?

01:02.604 --> 01:04.313
Easy to move around, versatile?

01:04.480 --> 01:07.483
Are you gonna park the car or you
gonna stand there looking at me?

01:07.817 --> 01:10.986
This is... big and impressive.

01:11.154 --> 01:13.864
And it has a really bright light on it.

01:14.032 --> 01:16.575
- Kiss the camera, please.
- I'm not kissing the camera.

01:16.743 --> 01:18.869
How much did this cost you?

01:19.037 --> 01:21.663
How much did...?
I'll kiss you, not the camera.

01:23.083 --> 01:24.666
Turn that thing...

01:27.128 --> 01:29.880
- What are you doing?
- Yeah, see.

01:30.840 --> 01:32.049
You think this'll work?

01:32.217 --> 01:34.426
I think we're gonna have
a very interesting time,

01:34.594 --> 01:38.639
capturing whatever paranormal phenomena 
is occurring or not occurring.

01:38.807 --> 01:41.391
Seriously, what'd you
throw down for that?

01:41.559 --> 01:44.311
Well, about half as much
as I made today.

01:46.689 --> 01:49.191
Good thing you're cute. Dinner?

01:49.359 --> 01:53.153
- Just keep going up the stairs.
- Oh, my God.

01:55.156 --> 01:57.157
- All right, I'll make dinner.
- Good.

01:57.367 --> 02:00.494
No. We're just gonna film
whatever happens to us,

02:00.662 --> 02:04.081
and then when any weird shit goes on,

02:04.249 --> 02:08.877
we will be in a perfect position
to capture it for posterity.

02:09.044 --> 02:12.214
Oh, so we can always, like,
look back and remember fondly?

02:12.382 --> 02:14.842
Well, you know, hopefully,
once we get it on camera,

02:15.009 --> 02:17.427
- we can figure out what's going on.
- OK.

02:17.595 --> 02:21.431
Once we know what's going on,
we can react appropriately.

02:22.767 --> 02:26.603
- And...
- Take it from there.

02:27.647 --> 02:31.400
Take care of it, whatever it is.
If it's one of those neighbors,

02:31.568 --> 02:33.402
one of those kids
who's obsessed with you

02:33.570 --> 02:36.113
and is trying to peep through a window
or something at night,

02:36.281 --> 02:38.073
that will take care of them.

02:38.241 --> 02:41.994
Unless that kid has been following me
since I was eight years old.

02:42.162 --> 02:44.288
- Something pretty creepy.
- I don't think that's the thing.

02:44.455 --> 02:45.455
You're telling me.

02:45.874 --> 02:49.084
- You know, I realize that you're...
- Are you all right? Are you OK?

02:49.711 --> 02:51.461
Are you doing OK?

02:52.422 --> 02:55.048
- Are you talking to the...?
- Are you happy?

02:55.216 --> 02:57.092
Do you have enough batteries?

02:57.260 --> 03:00.304
You're supposed to be in love with me,
not the machine.

03:00.763 --> 03:02.973
We are gonna be sleeping
with this camera.

03:03.141 --> 03:05.142
- We're gonna what?
- Put it in the bedroom.

03:05.310 --> 03:06.685
All night?

03:07.979 --> 03:09.563
You're cute.

03:09.981 --> 03:11.273
Yeah.

03:12.442 --> 03:14.902
That was shy. You looked away.

03:21.409 --> 03:22.743
Dinny time.

03:24.954 --> 03:29.249
- Test, audio test.
- This is the last test, right?

03:29.417 --> 03:31.585
Yeah. Can you just please talk, please?

03:31.753 --> 03:35.589
Hello, Micah. You're the
best boyfriend in the whole world,

03:35.757 --> 03:37.925
- except for your strange fascination
- Video's good.

03:38.092 --> 03:41.011
- with electronics.
- Katie, say something.

03:41.179 --> 03:44.306
- What do you want me to say?
- Something really quiet.

03:44.474 --> 03:45.974
What do you want me to say?

03:46.142 --> 03:47.976
- Whisper.
- I am whispering.

03:48.144 --> 03:50.270
- Can you hear me?
- Whisper.

03:50.438 --> 03:52.481
- I am whispering.
- You're not whispering.

03:52.649 --> 03:54.483
I am whispering now.

03:54.651 --> 03:56.652
That's a whisper,
and I think we caught it on camera.

03:56.819 --> 04:00.030
All right, sweet,
this microphone is worth the cash.

04:00.198 --> 04:02.115
All right, we're operational, babe.

04:03.159 --> 04:04.326
Sweet!

04:05.495 --> 04:10.165
Do you know of any tricks
to make this stuff happen?

04:10.333 --> 04:14.044
I don't wanna make...
them, it, whatever...

04:14.212 --> 04:15.837
I don't want it to happen at all.

04:16.005 --> 04:18.589
So I don't wanna force it to happen.

04:19.801 --> 04:22.844
You know, if it catches something,
great, but I'm not gonna like...

04:23.012 --> 04:25.764
OK. I mean, I'm just saying 'cause
you know, have it on camera

04:25.932 --> 04:29.059
would be pretty cool
for a lot of reasons, sweetie.

04:29.227 --> 04:30.394
- It would...
- I know.

04:30.561 --> 04:33.313
- substantiate your claims.
- You believe me, right?

04:33.481 --> 04:35.023
Yeah, of course.

04:41.281 --> 04:42.281
Hey.

04:52.292 --> 04:53.709
What is that?

04:55.878 --> 04:57.129
Let's investigate it.

04:57.588 --> 04:59.548
We're hearing a weird sound.

05:08.641 --> 05:10.058
You hear it?

05:16.065 --> 05:17.607
Is it the fridge?

05:20.069 --> 05:21.653
It's the icemaker.

05:23.281 --> 05:24.823
Damn it!

05:25.825 --> 05:28.243
It will only come out
when we sleep here.

05:28.745 --> 05:30.078
I'd like to take this moment

05:30.246 --> 05:33.248
to illustrate the beauty
of this fine instrument.

05:34.250 --> 05:36.418
I meant her. This is just my guitar.

05:37.587 --> 05:38.754
You're sweet.

05:42.091 --> 05:45.010
- What is this?
- I just like your feet. They're sexy.

05:45.178 --> 05:47.095
I need to repaint my toenails.

05:47.263 --> 05:49.014
You shouldn't film my feet.

05:49.182 --> 05:51.850
Sex type thing.
Can I get a little striptease?

05:53.102 --> 05:55.270
Please? Just a half of one.

05:55.438 --> 05:57.606
Just bra and panties.

05:57.774 --> 06:01.360
- No.
- All right. I'll do anything you want.

06:01.527 --> 06:02.527
No.

06:02.695 --> 06:04.196
Bullshit.

06:06.449 --> 06:09.284
Yeah, the Venus.
Hey, go back in your Venus pose.

06:09.452 --> 06:12.204
No. So where are we gonna put it?

06:12.955 --> 06:15.207
You've got the bathroom or the hallway.

06:15.375 --> 06:18.835
I think it should point down the hall,
that's where we heard its footsteps.

06:19.003 --> 06:20.295
It's kinda dark.

06:22.131 --> 06:23.173
You can't see me here?

06:23.341 --> 06:27.177
- Not at all.
- What if I turn this one on?

06:28.346 --> 06:29.721
Yeah, that's good.

06:29.889 --> 06:33.058
- That's cool? Need more light?
- No, I think you're fine.

06:33.226 --> 06:35.310
- All right.
- Come check it out.

06:38.898 --> 06:41.191
What happened with putting 
the camera out here?

06:44.153 --> 06:46.780
- We could get...
- It's gotta get old, right?

06:46.948 --> 06:48.990
Careful. You're about
to run into the shower.

06:49.158 --> 06:50.909
We could get extracurricular with this.

06:51.077 --> 06:52.411
I mentioned it before.

06:52.578 --> 06:55.747
- We could... but no.
- OK.

06:55.915 --> 06:57.332
Nice try, though.

06:57.500 --> 07:00.335
I just want you to know
I'm crying inside.

07:01.671 --> 07:03.964
I'm putting this thing back.

07:04.132 --> 07:08.009
OK, now hook up the FireWire.
Going off.

07:10.972 --> 07:13.932
- Is it working?
- It is, or isn't?

07:15.184 --> 07:16.726
Yeah, I think it's good.

07:20.022 --> 07:21.982
Oh, God.

07:30.450 --> 07:33.452
How am I supposed to sleep with that?

07:34.662 --> 07:36.204
It'll be fine.

07:55.016 --> 07:56.766
It's looking at me.

08:30.551 --> 08:33.428
This is what Katie looks like
in the morning.

08:35.640 --> 08:37.432
She is so pretty.

08:39.227 --> 08:43.438
- What do you want for breakfast?
- Whatever. What the hell...

08:43.606 --> 08:46.650
"Whatever" isn't an answer.
How about scrambled eggs?

08:46.817 --> 08:50.111
- Sounds pretty good.
- Yeah? Good.

08:52.114 --> 08:54.658
- Hey, babe?
- What?

08:54.825 --> 08:57.619
Did you drop my keys on the floor?

08:58.454 --> 08:59.454
Hold on.

08:59.622 --> 09:01.456
My keys are in the middle of the floor.

09:01.624 --> 09:03.625
I just... 
Look where I found my keys.

09:05.753 --> 09:08.296
- Where did you leave them?
- I left them on the counter.

09:08.464 --> 09:10.131
Are you sure?

09:10.299 --> 09:13.218
Yes. I always leave them in the same spot, 
next to your wallet.

09:13.970 --> 09:17.055
Obviously, this is
incontrovertible evidence

09:17.223 --> 09:21.184
that evil forces came from beyond the grave 
to move your keys.

09:21.352 --> 09:23.103
Make your breakfast.

09:26.524 --> 09:29.234
That would be a 3.0 on the splash scale.

09:29.402 --> 09:32.821
- What are you doing up there?
- I'm filming you.

09:32.989 --> 09:33.989
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

09:40.037 --> 09:43.957
Very, very mature. 
I think that's my...

09:44.125 --> 09:45.333
I got a big one!

09:46.460 --> 09:49.796
I think that's my favorite quality in you, 
it's your maturity.

09:51.507 --> 09:54.175
Big day. It's the day of the psychic,
he's coming.

09:54.343 --> 09:56.261
He should be here within the hour.

09:56.429 --> 09:59.180
We're gonna go find Micah
and see how he's feeling about it.

09:59.348 --> 10:00.932
My guess? Very excited.

10:01.100 --> 10:06.688
All right, tell me how excited
you are to meet our psychic.

10:06.856 --> 10:11.484
- Who will be here within the hour.
- The doctor will be here? Great.

10:11.652 --> 10:14.446
So excited, I can't contain myself.

10:14.614 --> 10:17.532
Can't contain yourself?
Let it all out. Don't be shy.

10:17.700 --> 10:23.580
I got something quite appropriate
for your psychic, though, I think.

10:23.748 --> 10:26.708
- What?
- I just, you know, stumbled upon it.

10:26.876 --> 10:28.168
Show me.

10:28.336 --> 10:31.546
Maybe I'll play this when he gets here.
I think it'll make him feel at home.

10:36.802 --> 10:39.262
You are totally not taking
this seriously, are you?

10:40.556 --> 10:43.558
Don't you wanna make him feel at home
and welcome in his own environment?

10:43.726 --> 10:44.893
I mean, this way...

10:45.061 --> 10:49.356
This is not gonna make him feel at home.
This is gonna make him leave.

10:49.523 --> 10:51.608
We're not gonna insult...
You, not me. You.

10:51.776 --> 10:54.903
Don't you smile like
you're so happy with yourself.

10:55.071 --> 10:57.322
How about less music?

10:57.907 --> 10:58.907
That was good.

10:59.075 --> 11:01.993
Is the psychic gonna give me 
some stock tips while he's here?

11:02.536 --> 11:04.788
Haven't bet on the horses in awhile.

11:04.955 --> 11:08.458
- Maybe if you're good.
- An opinion on the hundred-to-one shot?

11:08.626 --> 11:09.918
- Stock?
- I'm done with you.

11:10.086 --> 11:13.046
So you'd think a psychic
would be on time.

11:14.382 --> 11:17.759
You know, like he could foretell
if the traffic was gonna be bad?

11:17.927 --> 11:19.260
You're clever.

11:20.262 --> 11:21.429
Wait, let me get my music.

11:21.597 --> 11:24.432
Don't you even think about
turning that on.

11:26.394 --> 11:28.478
- Hi. Dr. Fredrichs?
- Yes. Hi.

11:28.646 --> 11:30.689
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you. Come on in.

11:30.856 --> 11:32.315
- This is Micah.
- Oh, hi. Micah.

11:32.483 --> 11:33.650
I'm sorry for the camera.

11:33.818 --> 11:36.152
So can you see ahead of, like,
that kind of thing?

11:36.320 --> 11:39.447
- Like know when traffic's gonna be bad?
- Cut.

11:39.615 --> 11:42.784
Oh, usually it depends on the day
of the week, or the time of the day.

11:42.952 --> 11:44.202
- You know.
- Like all of us.

11:44.370 --> 11:47.247
I never hesitate when somebody
says, "Will you come to San Diego?"

11:47.415 --> 11:48.915
I'm always ready to do that.

11:49.083 --> 11:52.711
I'm certainly glad you could make the trip today. 
We really do appreciate it.

11:52.878 --> 11:54.879
I'd like to spend time
getting to know you,

11:55.047 --> 11:58.133
getting a bit more information
than what we shared over the phone.

11:58.300 --> 12:00.468
Getting to know both of you,
what's your life like,

12:00.636 --> 12:02.554
what's your relationship like...

12:02.722 --> 12:04.139
It's good.

12:04.306 --> 12:07.308
- It's good? That's one good step.
- Straight to the point there.

12:07.476 --> 12:08.977
How long have the two of you
been together?

12:09.145 --> 12:10.478
- Three years.
- Three years?

12:10.646 --> 12:13.148
We're engaged to be engaged
after she graduates.

12:14.233 --> 12:16.985
- And your jobs? Both your jobs?
- I'm a student.

12:17.153 --> 12:20.155
I'm an English major,
hoping to be a teacher soon.

12:20.322 --> 12:24.993
I don't know where yet.
Micah is a day trader.

12:25.161 --> 12:26.870
- Yeah.
- How about your health?

12:28.164 --> 12:31.291
- We're in good health.
- And no medications involved?

12:31.459 --> 12:32.584
- No.
- OK.

12:32.752 --> 12:35.712
More often than not,
things that you've shared with me

12:35.880 --> 12:41.551
can be explained away by simple things,
like squeaky houses or rattling pipes

12:41.719 --> 12:45.180
or you know,
some normal thing that's going on

12:45.347 --> 12:49.726
that has people more freaked because
they're under a high degree of stress.

12:49.894 --> 12:54.439
So... So this...
let's call it a haunting,

12:54.607 --> 12:57.025
has happened to you
before moving into this house.

12:57.193 --> 13:02.280
Yes. It started when I was eight.

13:02.448 --> 13:05.784
I, you know,
I lived with my family, of course,

13:05.951 --> 13:09.662
and shared a room with my
younger sister, Christi. She was five.

13:09.830 --> 13:15.752
And at that time we both, you know,
experienced whatever it was.

13:15.920 --> 13:18.755
We had... I would feel the breathing
and it would wake me up,

13:18.923 --> 13:21.549
and I would wake her up.
And I would see the...

13:24.094 --> 13:28.765
I guess you'd call it like the, 
like just a mass, like the shadowy figure

13:28.933 --> 13:30.517
that would be at the foot of my bed.

13:30.684 --> 13:33.061
It was always at the foot of my bed,
never at the foot of her bed.

13:33.229 --> 13:35.396
- But she did see it.
- She saw it also?

13:35.564 --> 13:38.983
Absolutely. And we were both 
absolutely terrified.

13:39.151 --> 13:42.570
- OK.
- I mean, you know, couldn't even move.

13:42.738 --> 13:46.407
You know, you just...
It was just... It was horrifying.

13:46.575 --> 13:49.661
And we would just pray.
Please, please let it just go away.

13:49.829 --> 13:51.454
And then, eventually, it would.

13:51.622 --> 13:54.290
So this happened for a while
in our first house.

13:54.458 --> 13:58.086
And then we...
There was a fire. We managed...

13:58.254 --> 14:01.965
Everyone got out, no one was hurt,
thank God... Thank goodness.

14:02.132 --> 14:05.718
But we lost everything.
So we moved.

14:06.679 --> 14:08.680
Was it ever determined
what caused the fire?

14:08.848 --> 14:10.515
- No.
- OK.

14:10.683 --> 14:15.270
And I... You know, I'm not saying
it had to do with the haunting stuff.

14:15.437 --> 14:18.022
I'm not saying that at all.
I don't know what it was.

14:18.190 --> 14:21.609
Did the fire department do any investigation 
of the causes of the fire?

14:21.777 --> 14:24.028
I don't know if there was
a criminal investigation,

14:24.196 --> 14:28.283
but I know that they tried to figure out
what was the cause, and they couldn't.

14:28.450 --> 14:30.618
- OK.
- It wasn't electrical or anything,

14:30.786 --> 14:32.620
you know, simple like that.

14:32.788 --> 14:36.040
So then, from the time you were
eight years old until now,

14:36.208 --> 14:39.294
have you experienced this periodically
over the ensuing years?

14:39.461 --> 14:43.089
Yes. From 13 on it's happened,
it's happened periodically.

14:43.257 --> 14:46.676
Over the past few weeks
things have started happening again.

14:46.969 --> 14:50.346
So when you tell me that it's moved
from where you were living

14:50.514 --> 14:52.765
when you were eight,
again when you were living

14:52.933 --> 14:55.476
someplace else when you were 13,
and now here,

14:55.644 --> 14:57.604
it seems to me that's what
we're dealing with.

14:57.771 --> 15:00.982
Something that's
basically connected to you.

15:01.984 --> 15:05.111
These lights have been flickering,
these ones that are in the ceiling.

15:05.279 --> 15:09.324
We've had water from the faucets
turn on and off unexplainably.

15:09.491 --> 15:10.825
- OK.
- Or we'll come down.

15:10.993 --> 15:12.994
Not turn on and off,
but we'll come down and it'll be on.

15:13.162 --> 15:16.873
We've heard banging on the walls,
scratching sounds,

15:17.041 --> 15:20.835
like, you know, like dragging down
the wall kind of scratches.

15:21.003 --> 15:23.087
Most of the activity is in here,
isn't it?

15:23.255 --> 15:24.923
Yes. The vast majority of it.

15:26.175 --> 15:27.342
I've heard whispering.

15:27.509 --> 15:32.680
Sometimes I can't understand it,
sometimes it's saying my name.

15:32.848 --> 15:34.515
Oh, so it specifically
calls to your name?

15:34.683 --> 15:36.851
- It has before.
- You've heard this too, Micah?

15:37.019 --> 15:39.437
Well, I've heard weird noises.

15:39.605 --> 15:42.607
I haven't really heard anyone
say Katie's name, except for me.

15:42.775 --> 15:44.317
That might've been me in my sleep.

15:44.485 --> 15:48.237
I can tell the difference between you
saying "Katie" from over there in bed

15:48.405 --> 15:52.700
and something right here
whispering distinctly in my ear.

15:52.868 --> 15:57.538
Yeah, so, look. And I got like a FireWire 
going into my laptop, you know,

15:57.706 --> 16:00.208
we can record all night what...
You want to take this?

16:00.376 --> 16:03.378
Got the tripod, wide angle lens,
get the whole room

16:03.545 --> 16:07.006
EVP recorder, just to catch any sounds.

16:07.174 --> 16:09.217
So you'll go to bed
and have the light on

16:09.385 --> 16:11.636
and have the camera going
as you're going to bed.

16:11.804 --> 16:15.640
- Is this, do you do this all the time?
- We've just started with the camera.

16:15.808 --> 16:17.725
Our extra bathroom right there.

16:17.893 --> 16:20.937
Guest bedrooms.
Lights flickering in here.

16:21.105 --> 16:23.815
Is there something we can do
to make the stuff happen?

16:23.983 --> 16:26.359
- To get it on tape?
- I've told him I don't want to

16:26.527 --> 16:28.903
mess with that. I didn't
want him to get the camera.

16:29.071 --> 16:31.531
These hauntings,
they feed off of negative energy.

16:31.699 --> 16:33.992
So if there is something negative
going on here,

16:34.159 --> 16:36.786
it will help spur on the haunting.

16:36.954 --> 16:39.414
You know the entity
may feed off of that.

16:39.581 --> 16:43.209
You shouldn't let your mother come over 
anymore. She's really mean.

16:43.377 --> 16:44.627
Stop joking, Micah.

16:50.759 --> 16:53.386
My area of expertise
is dealing with ghosts.

16:53.554 --> 16:55.263
That's what I've built my career on,

16:55.431 --> 16:58.349
helping people get in touch
with people who have died.

16:58.517 --> 17:00.393
Communicating with ghosts.

17:00.561 --> 17:02.895
The spirits of dead human beings.

17:03.063 --> 17:05.022
A demon is something different.

17:05.190 --> 17:08.608
That's an entity that relates
to something that is non-human.

17:08.777 --> 17:09.777
OK.

17:09.944 --> 17:12.696
A lot of debate and discussion
about what that could be,

17:12.865 --> 17:14.281
but it's not a person.

17:14.450 --> 17:15.950
- OK.
- OK?

17:16.743 --> 17:18.786
Dealing with demons is not my area.

17:18.954 --> 17:22.248
I'm very uncomfortable with it,
and I'll tell you, quite frankly,

17:22.415 --> 17:24.125
I sense there's something going on
in this house.

17:24.292 --> 17:27.753
You cannot run from this.
It'll follow you.

17:27.921 --> 17:30.214
It may lay dormant for years.

17:30.382 --> 17:33.051
Something may trigger it to get...
become more active,

17:33.218 --> 17:37.472
and it will, over time,
reach out to communicate with you.

17:37.639 --> 17:40.141
OK, I want to give you the name
of Dr. Johann Averies.

17:40.309 --> 17:44.312
He's a colleague. He's a demonologist,
he specializes in this sort of thing.

17:44.480 --> 17:45.605
- He's in Los Angeles.
- OK.

17:45.773 --> 17:49.650
All right, check this out. 
What if we just get this Ouija board, right?

17:49.818 --> 17:53.654
We find out what it wants, then we give it 
what it wants and then... gone.

17:53.822 --> 17:56.657
Because what it probably wants is Katie.

17:56.825 --> 17:59.994
And if you do pick up a board
and try to play games with it,

18:00.162 --> 18:03.247
the entity will sense that
you're trying to communicate with it,

18:03.415 --> 18:06.167
and that's opening the door,
inviting it in.

18:06.335 --> 18:09.295
- Do you understand me?
- Yeah, I'm with you.

18:10.589 --> 18:14.675
I hope so. 
You're gonna be fine. OK?

18:14.843 --> 18:16.677
Glad to hear you say that.

18:16.845 --> 18:19.680
Thank you so much for coming.

18:19.848 --> 18:23.518
I will definitely give
Dr. Averies a call.

18:23.685 --> 18:26.687
- Have a very safe trip back.
- I will. Bye-bye, both of you.

18:26.855 --> 18:29.774
- Nice to meet you, bye.
- Later. What a fruit!

18:29.942 --> 18:32.693
Do you think you could try not to be
completely rude to him?

18:33.862 --> 18:36.447
I feel like it was good information,
like I'm not nuts.

18:36.615 --> 18:38.950
I feel like at least
we're doing something.

18:39.118 --> 18:40.868
I'm gonna call that guy tomorrow.

18:41.036 --> 18:42.161
What guy?

18:42.329 --> 18:46.124
- Dr. Johann Averies?
- That demon guy?

18:46.291 --> 18:47.875
- Don't laugh at him.
- No, don't.

18:48.043 --> 18:50.545
Seriously, don't call the guy, OK?
That's insane.

18:50.712 --> 18:54.006
- He said to call him tomorrow.
- Babe. Don't call the guy.

18:54.174 --> 18:56.884
No, promise me you're not gonna
call that guy. Please?

18:57.052 --> 18:58.886
- Want me to promise?
- I talked with the one dude,

18:59.054 --> 19:01.472
I'm not putting up with like a team,
a legion of...

19:01.640 --> 19:02.765
- OK.
- Jesus freaks.

19:02.933 --> 19:05.560
- If it gets worse I'm gonna call him.
- All right.

19:05.727 --> 19:09.605
Yeah. You sound way better
when you're brushing your teeth.

19:10.941 --> 19:13.776
Have a little extracurricular activity 
with this camera?

19:13.944 --> 19:15.444
Not with this camera on us, no.

19:15.612 --> 19:17.655
OK, taking the camera off
for ten minutes.

19:17.823 --> 19:18.906
Ten minutes, huh?

19:19.074 --> 19:21.200
That's all I need.
I don't know about you.

19:22.369 --> 19:24.120
Let's go to bed. Turn it off.

19:24.288 --> 19:26.914
All right. I'll set up
in the bedroom.

19:27.082 --> 19:30.251
- Turn it off!
- Katie is in the bathroom.

19:31.420 --> 19:34.589
- Turn it off. Turn it off!
- Hi, Katie.

19:34.756 --> 19:36.549
I want to pee! Turn it off.

19:36.717 --> 19:39.802
Dr. Johann. I am Dr. Johann.

19:39.970 --> 19:42.138
- OK, I'm about to pee.
- I'm a demonologist.

19:42.306 --> 19:44.348
Go away. I can't hear you,
can't hear you.

19:44.516 --> 19:47.476
I'm here to save you from the demons.

19:49.354 --> 19:50.688
Come to bed.

19:50.856 --> 19:55.943
I will! Just let me turn this off... 
Play time?

19:56.945 --> 19:58.112
Wait!

20:01.700 --> 20:03.117
- Excuse me.
- What?

20:03.285 --> 20:05.953
- The camera's not off.
- It's off. That's the standby light.

20:06.121 --> 20:08.664
That's not the standby light.
That's the record light.

20:08.832 --> 20:10.875
- Don't lie to me.
- All right.

20:13.295 --> 20:16.797
I think that probably was illegal
in Kentucky and another 12 states.

20:18.258 --> 20:20.509
This girl is a wild animal.

20:22.930 --> 20:24.347
What time you getting up?

20:24.514 --> 20:26.557
Don't know,
six o'clock or so.

20:27.726 --> 20:29.810
Did you set your alarm?

21:38.755 --> 21:40.506
Sleep good?

21:40.882 --> 21:41.882
Is that the video?

21:42.050 --> 21:43.801
I was looking at the footage
from last night.

21:43.969 --> 21:46.304
Check it out.
This is about 2:10 in the morning.

21:47.306 --> 21:48.556
- The doors...
- A minute.

21:48.724 --> 21:49.724
You got it?

21:49.891 --> 21:53.561
The doors and windows all over the house 
are closed. I just checked them.

21:53.729 --> 21:57.732
The flowers are not moving.
But something else is.

21:59.735 --> 22:02.486
- The door's fricking moving by itself.
- Oh, my God.

22:02.654 --> 22:06.574
And it's not over. Check it out.
It moves again.

22:10.245 --> 22:13.247
- Oh, Micah, that is...
- That's impossible.

22:14.416 --> 22:17.585
- I told you this was a good idea.
- Wow.

22:18.920 --> 22:20.838
You think you can get that ghost back?

22:21.006 --> 22:22.965
- Think I can do what?
- Get the ghost back.

22:23.133 --> 22:25.301
Get us some more interesting...
you know.

22:26.219 --> 22:28.763
I'm not interested in that.
I just want him to go away.

22:38.607 --> 22:41.859
Oh, Micah!
Oh, my God.

22:43.445 --> 22:46.280
What are you doing?
Come here! Come here right now!

22:46.448 --> 22:47.448
What?

22:47.616 --> 22:49.575
It's right there.
It's right there! Get it!

22:51.495 --> 22:52.787
Get rid of it. Please.

22:52.954 --> 22:55.414
You scream like that for a spider?

22:55.582 --> 22:58.501
- Oh, God.
- Jesus.

22:58.668 --> 23:01.712
- Did you go get the camera first?
- Yeah.

23:01.880 --> 23:04.507
I thought it was a ghost
or something like real scary...

23:04.674 --> 23:07.301
I'm nearly losing my mind
and you grab the camera.

23:07.469 --> 23:10.137
Hey, little friend! 
What's your name?

23:10.305 --> 23:14.392
Can I turn the camera off?
OK. I need to not be around you.

23:14.559 --> 23:18.437
- All right. We're going.
- Straight outside. OK.

23:23.151 --> 23:24.819
Hey, you out here?

23:33.412 --> 23:35.579
Hey, tell me what the point of this was.

23:38.667 --> 23:41.877
Was part of your master plan
just to move the door?

23:43.004 --> 23:45.172
Or are you just doing random shit?

23:47.217 --> 23:50.594
Well. Basically, it could be two things:

23:50.762 --> 23:54.056
It could be a ghost,
or it could be a demon.

23:54.891 --> 23:57.017
Dr. Fredrichs said
that it wasn't a ghost.

23:57.185 --> 23:58.769
- And whatever it is...
- I'm going by the evidence.

23:58.937 --> 24:01.981
I'm doing my research
and I'm gonna find out what it is.

24:02.149 --> 24:05.234
Well, whatever it is that's following me, 
it doesn't feel...

24:07.195 --> 24:08.612
It doesn't feel human.

24:08.780 --> 24:13.701
It feels like a monster.
I mean, like it wants to hurt me.

24:13.869 --> 24:16.203
Well, that sounds actually like a demon.

24:16.371 --> 24:19.915
- Yeah, that's what he said.
- Ghosts are spirits of human beings.

24:20.083 --> 24:21.709
Yeah. It's definitely not human.

24:21.877 --> 24:25.588
Then maybe you're right,
which is bad, 'cause demons suck!

24:25.755 --> 24:28.966
Basically, they're these malevolent, 
evil spirits

24:29.134 --> 24:34.889
that only exist to cause pain 
and commit evil for their own amusement.

24:35.056 --> 24:39.518
It's pretty creepy. I mean, 
they stalk people for years, like decades.

24:39.686 --> 24:43.772
They're sometimes really intelligent 
in the way they do things to freak you out.

24:44.733 --> 24:46.942
So this could be
a really rare phenomenon,

24:47.110 --> 24:48.694
and it's cool we got it on tape.

24:48.862 --> 24:51.614
I'm surprisingly not as excited as you,

24:51.781 --> 24:54.158
considering I'm the one
that's being terrified.

24:54.326 --> 24:56.285
It's all good. 
We'll take care of it.

24:57.078 --> 24:59.330
I understand that
this stuff is new to you,

24:59.498 --> 25:05.252
and exciting in some ways,
so I get your whole filming thing.

25:07.005 --> 25:09.965
But it isn't new to me,

25:10.133 --> 25:14.637
and I think this thing
could be very dangerous.

25:14.804 --> 25:18.349
So I just... I just want you to know 
that as things get...

25:18.517 --> 25:20.643
things progress
or get worse in any way,

25:20.810 --> 25:23.562
I don't want to mess with the camera.
Don't want to make it mad.

25:23.730 --> 25:26.357
I understand where you're
coming from, just remember

25:26.525 --> 25:28.776
you didn't exactly warn me
about this stuff

25:28.944 --> 25:30.819
- before we moved in together.
- I know.

25:30.987 --> 25:33.948
So I think I have
a little bit of say in what we do.

25:34.115 --> 25:36.450
I get that, honestly.
But what was I supposed to say?

25:36.618 --> 25:38.911
On our first date,
"There's a demon that has been foll..."

25:39.079 --> 25:42.248
No, but maybe on our
15th date or our 30th date

25:42.415 --> 25:44.458
or when we decided to live together,

25:44.626 --> 25:47.294
that might've been
a good thing to bring up.

25:49.256 --> 25:51.215
Here.

26:02.102 --> 26:06.814
All right. The windows are locked,
doors are locked, alarm is on.

26:07.649 --> 26:09.984
Anything gets in here,
we're gonna know about it.

26:10.151 --> 26:13.571
I don't think it cares about
alarms and locked doors.

26:14.906 --> 26:17.533
It can go wherever it wants,
it can do whatever it wants.

26:17.701 --> 26:18.993
How do you know?

26:19.160 --> 26:21.787
Whatever's happening, it's already here.

26:23.456 --> 26:25.082
All right.

26:58.783 --> 27:00.534
What is this?

27:01.703 --> 27:03.329
What's the matter?

27:04.164 --> 27:07.124
I just...
I just had a nightmare.

27:11.755 --> 27:13.631
I'm sorry, did I scare you?

27:14.716 --> 27:16.508
It's all right,
don't worry about it.

27:17.719 --> 27:19.386
- Oh, my God.
- You OK?

27:19.554 --> 27:20.596
- Yeah.
- You sure?

27:20.764 --> 27:22.681
My head.

27:26.394 --> 27:27.936
Did you hear that?

27:28.938 --> 27:30.397
- I'm going down.
- No, no, no, Micah!

27:30.565 --> 27:31.565
Micah, no!

27:32.984 --> 27:34.902
Micah, don't leave me here.

27:35.070 --> 27:36.070
Don't leave me here.

27:36.237 --> 27:37.988
Take this.

27:41.743 --> 27:43.577
Where do you think that came from?

27:45.955 --> 27:48.248
- Micah!
- Is anyone down here?

28:06.935 --> 28:09.561
- This all you got?
- Oh, Micah, stop!

28:09.729 --> 28:13.232
Please don't do that.
Oh, baby, come on.

28:23.910 --> 28:25.327
You OK, baby?

28:27.455 --> 28:28.789
I'm OK.

28:28.957 --> 28:31.959
- You sure?
- I'm still creeped out.

28:32.961 --> 28:34.628
- Hey, girls?
- No, but you know what?

28:34.796 --> 28:38.173
- If you can just show me...
- Hello! Excuse me!

28:38.341 --> 28:39.758
I know it's bead time,

28:39.926 --> 28:42.344
but I have a little something
I want to show you guys.

28:42.512 --> 28:45.597
Can it wait? We're having
very intense girl time right now,

28:45.765 --> 28:48.475
and we cannot be interrupted
by Micah and his camera.

28:48.643 --> 28:51.645
- Thank you, OK. I understand.
- I need a little break from...

28:51.813 --> 28:53.772
What the fuck!
I'm trying to show you guys something.

28:53.940 --> 28:54.940
Hey! You be sweet.

28:55.108 --> 28:59.486
All right. This is the tape
from the digital audio recorder

28:59.654 --> 29:00.821
I set up in the bedroom.

29:01.698 --> 29:05.325
This is the tape from about ten seconds 
before we woke up.

29:14.085 --> 29:15.169
What the hell was that?

29:15.336 --> 29:19.006
I listened to it 50 times.
It's not saying anything.

29:19.174 --> 29:23.635
It's not a language that I recognize,
it's not a dog, it's not, like,

29:23.803 --> 29:26.180
noise from the street,
it's not any kind of

29:26.347 --> 29:28.682
electrical interference
that I recognize, so...

29:28.850 --> 29:30.601
- Oh, God!
- What I figure it is...

29:30.769 --> 29:32.686
I think the thing is
right in the bedroom.

29:32.854 --> 29:36.482
This thing wants to communicate.

29:36.649 --> 29:39.818
So, I figure I'm gonna go out
and get a Ouija board...

29:39.986 --> 29:41.195
No!

29:41.362 --> 29:43.363
I don't want to know
what this thing has to say.

29:43.531 --> 29:46.200
- I want it to leave us alone.
- Trust me. Bad idea.

29:46.367 --> 29:49.286
He specifically said,
"Don't do anything to antagonize or..."

29:49.454 --> 29:51.580
- Whatever it is.
- Sorry I told you about it.

29:51.748 --> 29:54.124
You're going to use a Ouija board 
and invite whatever it is in,

29:54.292 --> 29:56.668
- and it's not going to go away.
- Let me do my thing.

29:56.836 --> 30:01.131
The camera is your thing.
You do a Ouija board, there's no more.

30:01.299 --> 30:04.468
Nothing. Promise me.
Micah, promise me, please!

30:04.636 --> 30:07.554
Fine! I promise you
I won't buy a Ouija board.

30:07.722 --> 30:08.722
- OK?
- Thank you.

30:08.890 --> 30:11.391
Hey, Micah, smile.

30:15.897 --> 30:19.149
Hey, we haven't had anything interesting 
happen in a while!

30:20.193 --> 30:22.194
- Micah?
- You scared?

30:24.155 --> 30:25.155
What you got?

30:25.323 --> 30:27.241
Put the camera away,
we're going to bed.

30:27.408 --> 30:29.034
- Go back to sleep.
- Come on.

30:29.202 --> 30:33.330
- Hey! Don't antagonize...
- What you got? I'm calling you out!

30:33.498 --> 30:37.292
Hey! Hey, that's enough! 
Micah! Come on.

30:39.087 --> 30:41.255
Your demon's worthless.
You're worthless!

30:41.422 --> 30:43.090
You got nothing.

30:43.258 --> 30:45.634
- Put the camera away.
- OK.

31:13.746 --> 31:15.038
What's up?

31:16.124 --> 31:17.875
I just thought I heard something.

31:23.673 --> 31:25.257
What?
What'd you hear?

31:26.467 --> 31:27.718
Just a thud.

31:29.470 --> 31:33.849
- A thud? Where?
- Maybe downstairs.

31:51.284 --> 31:52.534
Fuck!

32:01.002 --> 32:04.504
Where are you going?
Oh, my God. 

32:06.507 --> 32:07.758
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

32:17.018 --> 32:20.228
Micah, wait, wait, wait, please.

32:20.396 --> 32:21.605
Where'd you go?

32:21.773 --> 32:26.860
I'm right here. I'm over here, babe.
I'm over here. Over here.

32:31.658 --> 32:33.659
Oh, my God.

32:35.328 --> 32:36.703
Hear that?

32:38.957 --> 32:40.707
Oh, God.

32:44.879 --> 32:47.381
- You OK, baby?
- Yeah.

32:54.138 --> 32:55.222
Oh, God.

32:55.390 --> 32:57.307
It looks like it's gone now,
whatever it was.

32:57.475 --> 32:58.600
OK, come on.

32:59.477 --> 33:01.561
That's video proof of that noise, though.

33:20.915 --> 33:22.290
Do you hear that?

33:36.723 --> 33:37.931
Hold on.

34:01.456 --> 34:02.873
You hear that?

34:03.041 --> 34:05.167
Yeah, I do.
I don't know what that is.

34:09.047 --> 34:10.880
This is really good stuff, Katie.

34:11.049 --> 34:13.257
I'm telling you. 
This is, this is the...

34:13.426 --> 34:18.889
I hope that guy... it, whatever,
shows us a little more action.

34:19.556 --> 34:21.850
- This is grade-A shit.
- I don't think we should be

34:22.018 --> 34:26.353
messing with this. This is why it scares me, 
you don't take it seriously.

34:26.522 --> 34:28.982
I take it seriously.
I think it's pretty...

34:29.150 --> 34:31.193
You have a camera in my face
in the bathroom.

34:31.360 --> 34:33.652
You look beautiful in the morning, 
by the way.

34:33.821 --> 34:35.697
Maybe we shouldn't have the camera.

34:37.324 --> 34:41.495
Hello. This is really golden shit. 
Come on.

34:41.661 --> 34:47.501
Not an option, at this point,
with all that cool stuff going on.

34:47.668 --> 34:49.503
- Cool?
- Or disturbing.

34:49.670 --> 34:53.172
- Are you not scared?
- It's... it's a little bizarre.

34:53.341 --> 34:57.010
But we have it documented,
it's gonna be fine, OK?

34:57.178 --> 35:02.182
Sounded like it was, like, sounds coming
from the wall or ceiling or something.

35:03.184 --> 35:07.229
- Or the floor.
- Floor? You think?

35:07.396 --> 35:10.899
Well, whatever it was... 
Oh, God!

35:11.818 --> 35:15.070
Like if someone were to drop 
something really, really big and heavy.

35:15.238 --> 35:18.448
Like what? Like someone
picked the couch up or something?

35:19.367 --> 35:23.370
You know, that kind of stuff
didn't happen to me before the camera.

35:24.914 --> 35:27.082
- Before what?
- Before the camera.

35:27.500 --> 35:30.210
- That has nothing to do with it.
- It's getting worse.

35:30.378 --> 35:32.838
It wasn't that bad.
It was like a little loud.

35:33.005 --> 35:35.423
That was my inner child being scared.

35:36.759 --> 35:39.803
I'm fine, thanks. All right?

35:43.850 --> 35:45.851
EVP Experiment Number One.

35:46.727 --> 35:48.311
Is there anyone here?

35:50.398 --> 35:52.399
Where did you come from?

35:55.695 --> 35:58.655
You have something to say?
In English, this time?

36:02.702 --> 36:04.995
Would you be happier
talking with the Ouija board?

36:08.958 --> 36:12.794
What is your quest?
What is your favorite color?

36:14.297 --> 36:16.214
<i>Where did you come from?</i>

36:21.053 --> 36:24.097
<i>You have something to say?
In English, this time?</i>

36:25.349 --> 36:27.267
It's got nothing to say, huh?

36:27.435 --> 36:30.228
<i>Would you be happier
talking with the Ouija board?</i>

36:30.813 --> 36:33.440
Whoa, what the hell.

36:34.942 --> 36:37.444
Is that you grunting?

36:40.823 --> 36:44.117
Was it like one for "Yes", two for "No"?

36:45.119 --> 36:48.079
Yeah? Nice.

36:51.500 --> 36:54.169
Yeah. Let's watch a movie.
I don't want to go to sleep yet.

36:54.337 --> 36:57.088
- Why not?
- 'Cause I'm scared.

36:58.633 --> 37:01.301
- Yeah.
- Come on, put the camera off.

38:49.243 --> 38:50.410
Katie.

38:59.837 --> 39:01.254
Katie!

39:03.382 --> 39:05.759
You down here? Babe?

39:22.943 --> 39:24.152
Fuck.

39:44.632 --> 39:45.799
Katie?

39:52.765 --> 39:53.973
Babe!

39:56.644 --> 39:58.770
What are you doing out here?

40:01.023 --> 40:03.149
- Hey. Hey.
- What?

40:03.317 --> 40:05.985
It's freezing out here.
What are you doing with no clothes on?

40:06.153 --> 40:09.572
- I'm fine.
- Come on.

40:09.740 --> 40:11.991
No. I don't want to go in.

40:12.159 --> 40:13.827
Just leave me alone.

40:13.994 --> 40:16.329
- Are you OK, baby?
- I'm fine.

40:17.665 --> 40:19.541
- Come on.
- No.

40:22.294 --> 40:25.296
You just want to sit out here
in the swing in the middle of the night,

40:25.464 --> 40:30.051
- while it's freezing?
- Yes. Go away.

40:32.012 --> 40:35.515
I'll stay out here with you.
I'm gonna get some blankets, OK?

40:38.269 --> 40:42.230
Jesus Christ.
What the fuck is going on?

40:42.648 --> 40:43.982
Ridiculous.

40:44.150 --> 40:46.401
Sitting out in the cold.

40:49.530 --> 40:51.197
Fuck is that?

40:54.827 --> 40:57.662
Hey! Who's there?

40:59.331 --> 41:00.957
Katie, come inside!

41:10.885 --> 41:13.136
What the fuck is going on? Come out!

41:32.531 --> 41:33.907
Fuck!

41:36.035 --> 41:37.827
- What are you doing?
- What am I doing?

41:37.995 --> 41:40.371
- What the fuck are you doing?
- What do you mean?

41:43.000 --> 41:45.585
I just heard noises up here
and I came in to get a blanket

41:45.753 --> 41:47.504
- 'cause you're on the swing...
- What?

41:47.671 --> 41:50.423
for some reason.
There's all this stomping up here...

41:50.591 --> 41:53.259
- Come back to bed. You woke me up.
- And the TV is on.

41:54.970 --> 41:57.931
Jesus. I don't know
what the fuck is going on anymore.

41:58.098 --> 42:00.058
- I'm cold.
- Why are you crazy like this?

42:04.688 --> 42:07.023
So you don't remember any of this?

42:08.526 --> 42:09.859
No. I mean...

42:10.027 --> 42:11.986
You don't remember getting out of bed?

42:12.154 --> 42:15.114
You don't remember standing there
like a total weirdo?

42:15.282 --> 42:16.324
Hey.

42:16.492 --> 42:18.284
I'm saying, like...

42:19.912 --> 42:21.955
- Oh, my goodness.
- And this? You don't...

42:22.122 --> 42:23.456
Were you sleepwalking?

42:23.624 --> 42:27.085
- What was going through your mind?
- I don't know! I wasn't... I...

42:29.838 --> 42:31.839
- Oh, my gosh.
- Yeah.

42:32.007 --> 42:33.508
What do you remember from this?

42:33.676 --> 42:35.802
- Were you dreaming?
- I don't remember anything.

42:35.970 --> 42:39.347
I remember standing in the doorway
and you pointing a camera at me.

42:39.515 --> 42:43.226
And you were all freaked out.
I don't, I don't remember standing here.

42:43.394 --> 42:45.186
You went downstairs, sat in the swing.

42:45.354 --> 42:47.981
I went to get you a blanket
'cause you refused to come back.

42:48.148 --> 42:50.066
Fast forward it
to where I go downstairs.

42:51.277 --> 42:53.778
I'm freaking leaving the room. Where...

42:54.989 --> 42:57.198
You went outside and sat on the swing.

42:57.366 --> 42:59.742
And I went inside to bring you a blanket

42:59.910 --> 43:04.455
'cause you refused to leave in this 
catatonic, weird state you were in.

43:04.623 --> 43:06.958
- I don't know...
- Wait, wait. Did I talk to you?

43:07.126 --> 43:08.793
I wouldn't call it talking.

43:08.961 --> 43:13.631
But I come upstairs and there's 
like footsteps, and the TV's on.

43:15.301 --> 43:16.551
So that's...

43:16.719 --> 43:21.389
Well, maybe this kind of thing's
been happening for a long time

43:21.557 --> 43:23.600
and you just never knew about it.

43:24.435 --> 43:29.147
I don't remember anything. I know that
I had nightmares all night and that...

43:29.315 --> 43:30.356
What?

43:32.443 --> 43:34.193
I didn't want to talk about it.

43:34.361 --> 43:36.529
They were gruesome.
Let's leave it at that.

43:37.197 --> 43:39.240
It's trying to scare us.
It scared you and me...

43:39.408 --> 43:42.201
- It's working! I'm scared!
- Just got to stay strong.

43:43.704 --> 43:46.331
And not let it get to you,
not let it get to us.

43:46.999 --> 43:52.962
Look, bringing in somebody else,
some exorcist or whatever,

43:53.130 --> 43:56.215
lot of times it just gets worse.
You don't want it to get worse.

43:56.383 --> 44:01.429
- No, I don't.
- No. Me neither.

44:08.062 --> 44:10.563
Yeah, all right,
you little fucker.

44:10.731 --> 44:14.233
Got something to say?
Now's your chance.

44:16.320 --> 44:18.237
Katie! Where are you?

44:18.405 --> 44:19.906
I'll be down.
Hang on a second.

44:28.624 --> 44:31.376
I can't wait to get out 
of this house,

44:31.543 --> 44:34.420
go out and hang out
with my boyfriend.

44:35.964 --> 44:37.965
All right, we got, like, ten minutes.

44:38.801 --> 44:40.593
What in the hell are you doing, Micah?

44:40.761 --> 44:42.970
- Come on, help me.
- What are you doing?

44:43.138 --> 44:44.764
- I'm gonna talk to it.
- Look at me!

44:44.932 --> 44:45.932
I told you I was...

44:46.100 --> 44:47.934
You promised me you weren't gonna...

44:48.102 --> 44:50.436
Don't you look at me like that.
You promised me

44:50.604 --> 44:52.021
you weren't gonna mess with that.

44:52.189 --> 44:53.856
No! I promised you

44:54.024 --> 44:55.733
I wasn't gonna buy a Ouija board.

44:55.901 --> 44:56.901
I didn't buy a Ouija board.

44:57.069 --> 44:58.820
You knew exactly what I meant!

44:58.987 --> 45:00.113
I borrowed a Ouija board.

45:00.280 --> 45:02.448
How dare you? 
You knew exactly what I meant!

45:02.616 --> 45:04.450
I said don't mess with that
because it scared me,

45:04.618 --> 45:06.119
and what do you do?
You go out and get

45:06.286 --> 45:07.954
the best looking fucking
Ouija board I've ever seen,

45:08.122 --> 45:09.747
and you put it in the middle
of our living room?

45:09.915 --> 45:11.999
- Explain that to me!
- I borrowed it.

45:12.167 --> 45:13.710
You know, I don't care what you did.

45:13.877 --> 45:15.962
You're gonna throw it away.
We're gonna leave.

45:16.130 --> 45:17.338
- Katie...
- There's no more camera,

45:17.506 --> 45:19.382
there's no more nothing.
I don't want to hear it.

45:19.550 --> 45:21.259
- I don't even want to hear it.
- Katie.

45:21.427 --> 45:22.927
No, don't "Katie" me.
I'm leaving

45:23.095 --> 45:25.513
and you're either coming with me 
or you're not.

45:26.974 --> 45:28.975
- Chill it, babe!
- I don't want to hear it.

46:42.549 --> 46:44.425
Take your shoes off and go to bed...

46:44.593 --> 46:46.385
What?

46:46.553 --> 46:48.221
What'd you do?
What'd you do, Micah?

46:48.388 --> 46:50.181
Look at me!
What'd you do?

46:50.349 --> 46:52.558
I didn't do shit, babe.
Look...

46:55.604 --> 46:57.647
I cannot fucking believe you, Micah.

47:00.984 --> 47:03.361
I am finished. 
No more fucking camera, nothing.

47:03.529 --> 47:04.529
I'll take care of this.

47:04.696 --> 47:06.614
If you're not gonna do it,
then I will.

47:10.869 --> 47:14.789
Looks like someone drew something on it.

47:16.834 --> 47:20.127
I don't know. 
Hey, Katie?

47:20.295 --> 47:21.712
What?

47:22.548 --> 47:25.258
Can you come down here
and help me figure this out, please?

47:25.425 --> 47:27.093
Sorry?

47:27.678 --> 47:31.055
I think this thing left a message.
On the Ouija board.

47:35.686 --> 47:38.771
I don't give a fuck what that thing
says on the Ouija board!

47:40.190 --> 47:41.566
Babe...

47:43.569 --> 47:45.611
Katie! Look...

47:47.823 --> 47:51.909
- Kate. Hello. Hey.
- Micah, get the fuck out!

47:55.122 --> 47:56.873
- I don't want to look at that!
- Chill!

47:57.040 --> 48:00.501
- Look, this is not the time for this.
- Get out!

48:02.379 --> 48:03.671
Get out!

48:07.634 --> 48:10.845
I think she's pissed. 
That's not good.

48:13.640 --> 48:18.644
Hey, Katie? Katie? Hello?

48:18.812 --> 48:22.481
- Look, I know you're pissed, but...
- Do we have any lemon?

48:26.403 --> 48:29.989
What do I have to do?
Just tell me what I have to do.

48:30.157 --> 48:32.325
You have to turn off the fucking camera.

48:32.492 --> 48:34.660
The camera's... Fuck.
Forget the camera, OK?

48:44.004 --> 48:46.631
I swear to abide by Katie's

48:46.798 --> 48:50.843
rules and regulations of camera use...

48:52.220 --> 48:55.056
and other things.
Whatever.

48:55.223 --> 48:56.390
Is that good enough for you?

48:56.558 --> 48:58.893
I think it needs to be
a little more sincere.

49:02.689 --> 49:03.731
I...

49:04.191 --> 49:06.692
I swear to abide by Katie's

49:06.860 --> 49:10.029
rules and regulations of camera use

49:10.197 --> 49:13.491
and to not offend this entity,

49:13.659 --> 49:15.618
or whatever it is, in any way,

49:15.786 --> 49:18.162
shape, or form, so help me God.

49:18.330 --> 49:21.707
And I promise not to betray 
Katie's trust.

49:21.875 --> 49:24.377
And I promise not to betray 
Katie's trust.

49:24.544 --> 49:26.545
- Is there anything else?
- That'll be it.

49:28.715 --> 49:30.091
Good.

49:30.842 --> 49:32.009
Fuck.

49:33.220 --> 49:36.681
Can I at least get a kiss for that? 
Please?

49:39.935 --> 49:41.227
Goodnight.

50:00.080 --> 50:03.207
Katie, do you want to know...

50:03.375 --> 50:05.126
what happened to the Ouija board?

50:07.254 --> 50:08.921
I saw the tape, you know.

50:13.218 --> 50:15.094
I just want to forget about it, OK?

50:24.229 --> 50:25.521
Let's go to sleep.

50:37.868 --> 50:39.702
I think I found something pretty cool,

50:39.870 --> 50:42.329
and I'd like you to help me
figure it out.

50:42.497 --> 50:47.084
So, sit down. No? 
Or stand up.

50:47.252 --> 50:50.129
I caught on camera everything
that happened after we left.

50:50.297 --> 50:53.924
- When the cursor was moving by itself.
- OK.

50:54.092 --> 50:56.302
I'm trying to figure out what it said.

50:59.097 --> 51:01.140
I couldn't figure out
exactly what it said,

51:01.308 --> 51:03.309
but there's a lot of possibilities.

51:03.810 --> 51:07.480
Do you know anyone
named Edina or Diane?

51:07.647 --> 51:11.692
Could be Nadine, without two N's... No.

51:13.320 --> 51:16.614
- No.
- All right. Well, I'll work on it.

51:16.907 --> 51:18.199
You know, it may...

51:18.366 --> 51:21.660
It could be this thing's fucking with us 
and it doesn't mean anything.

51:21.828 --> 51:25.247
Or it could be... so many possibilities,
I mean, I could be wrong.

51:25.415 --> 51:26.540
I don't know.

51:26.708 --> 51:29.293
I don't really...
I don't really care what it means.

51:29.461 --> 51:32.088
You're done playing with it.
I want it out of the house.

51:33.632 --> 51:36.133
We haven't gone a week
without something happening.

51:36.301 --> 51:38.260
- That's crazy.
- I can't...

51:38.428 --> 51:41.514
- What're you guys talking about?
- I'm at my... Just everything.

51:41.848 --> 51:44.517
- Come stay with me.
- You remember, it's not the house.

51:44.684 --> 51:47.686
It's me. 
You know, wherever I go, it goes.

51:47.854 --> 51:50.606
What am I gonna do, go to your house,
mess things up for you?

51:50.774 --> 51:54.193
- I got a plan. Don't worry about it.
- Micah, what's your plan?

51:54.361 --> 51:57.363
- I got a plan.
- What? What're you gonna do?

51:57.531 --> 51:59.824
- You know what...
- Don't worry about it, OK?

52:00.325 --> 52:04.328
- All right? So.
- OK, here's the compromise...

52:04.496 --> 52:05.496
What?

52:05.664 --> 52:08.582
You can have your powder,
you can do your little experiment.

52:08.750 --> 52:11.043
If it doesn't work,
if it doesn't help us,

52:11.211 --> 52:14.380
I'm calling the demonologist
and we're getting this taken care of.

52:14.548 --> 52:17.633
- Yeah. Deal.
- Can you look at me and not the camera?

52:17.801 --> 52:20.386
No. Deal. All right, so.

52:20.554 --> 52:22.555
- Happy, yeah?
- Yeah.

52:22.722 --> 52:24.890
- Deal.
- All right.

52:26.059 --> 52:27.059
Is that thing on?

52:27.227 --> 52:31.397
Yes. And exactly
what is this gonna prove?

52:31.565 --> 52:35.067
Well, if anything walks through here,

52:35.235 --> 52:36.902
it's gonna leave
a pretty good footprint.

52:37.070 --> 52:40.406
OK. I think we've pretty much established 
something's happening.

52:40.574 --> 52:43.117
All right. So tomorrow,
I'm making the call.

52:43.285 --> 52:46.036
You can have your powder.
You can clean it up tomorrow.

52:46.204 --> 52:49.748
Take a deep breath,
pop a pill, it's fine.

52:49.916 --> 52:52.168
- Excuse me?
- Figure out what we're dealing with.

52:52.335 --> 52:53.627
- Micah!
- OK?

52:53.795 --> 52:57.381
- Then we can go crazy.
- Pop a pill, my ass.

52:57.591 --> 52:58.799
Does that look good to you?

52:58.967 --> 53:01.594
It looks like our floor
is covered with powder, yes.

53:01.761 --> 53:03.929
- I'll clean it up.
- All right.

53:04.097 --> 53:05.681
That's a thing of beauty.

53:05.849 --> 53:08.100
- Hey.
- Yeah.

53:08.268 --> 53:11.478
I've been doing my research.
I'm taking care of this.

53:11.646 --> 53:15.816
Nobody comes in my house,
fucks with my girlfriend,

53:15.984 --> 53:17.943
gets away with it. Here.

53:18.111 --> 53:19.111
What do you want to do about it?

53:19.279 --> 53:20.404
Want to call in the demon guy?

53:20.572 --> 53:22.114
- Yes! Exactly!
- Call an exorcist?

53:22.282 --> 53:23.282
I want to take care of this!

53:23.450 --> 53:24.783
Get a quack to tell us what to do?

53:24.951 --> 53:26.952
This is my house,
you're my girlfriend.

53:27.120 --> 53:29.330
I'm gonna fucking solve the problem.

53:29.497 --> 53:32.291
- OK?
- OK.

53:32.459 --> 53:36.378
Babe... 
Just have a little faith, huh?

53:39.674 --> 53:40.966
This is it.

53:42.427 --> 53:43.427
What's it?

53:43.595 --> 53:48.265
The powder is the last.
The last thing.

53:48.433 --> 53:50.601
Tomorrow I'm gonna make the call.

53:50.769 --> 53:52.311
Too cute to be talking.

54:42.487 --> 54:43.946
Did you hear that?

54:46.783 --> 54:48.158
Oh, shit!

54:48.326 --> 54:52.496
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.

55:00.839 --> 55:02.006
You know what?

55:05.677 --> 55:08.262
There's footsteps in,
but there's no footsteps out.

55:08.430 --> 55:09.722
Oh, God!

55:12.100 --> 55:15.060
- Don't leave me in here.
- Turn on the light, baby.

55:18.064 --> 55:19.898
Let's just get out and go downstairs.

55:20.066 --> 55:22.609
It's still here. Let's go!

55:24.612 --> 55:28.699
It finally can't run. Where is it?

55:28.867 --> 55:29.908
What?

55:32.746 --> 55:34.288
The prints stop over here.

55:34.456 --> 55:37.750
Micah, this could be a trap.
Please, let's go!

55:42.297 --> 55:43.589
Oh, my God!

55:44.466 --> 55:46.091
Did you do that?

55:53.266 --> 55:56.185
You didn't... You didn't, did you?
Tell me you opened that.

55:56.353 --> 55:59.772
Of course not.
What the hell is that?

56:03.902 --> 56:06.236
You're not going up...
You're not going up there.

56:06.404 --> 56:08.197
Oh, you're not going up there.

56:08.365 --> 56:12.743
I'm not going in there. 
Just gonna...

56:12.911 --> 56:15.037
- Just gonna look.
- No, you're not!

56:16.289 --> 56:18.791
I gotta go check it out.
I'm getting the ladder.

56:18.958 --> 56:21.627
OK. It's all set up.

56:22.796 --> 56:26.507
Micah, I really don't want you
to go up there. Please.

56:26.674 --> 56:29.968
I'm not going in there.
I'm just gonna look.

56:30.136 --> 56:32.846
You have no idea what's up there.
You've no idea!

56:33.014 --> 56:34.390
I know.

56:40.438 --> 56:41.772
Oh, Micah.

56:42.440 --> 56:45.484
Give me the camera. Yeah.

56:45.652 --> 56:49.196
- Be careful.
- All right, if something goes wrong,

56:49.364 --> 56:51.657
I'm gonna throw you the camera
and jump out, OK?

56:54.661 --> 56:56.078
Do you see anything?

57:04.838 --> 57:06.922
Micah, I don't want 
to be down here by myself.

57:07.090 --> 57:08.298
I'll be right back.

57:13.012 --> 57:15.055
What the fuck is that?

57:16.599 --> 57:18.934
There's something over there
stuck in the stuff.

57:19.102 --> 57:21.145
Oh, my God, Micah, come back down! 
Come on.

57:22.522 --> 57:24.189
Micah, please, come on.

57:25.692 --> 57:27.651
Now this...

57:28.403 --> 57:30.279
Hold on. Here.

57:30.447 --> 57:32.448
- What?
- Just take the camera.

57:32.615 --> 57:33.949
OK. Come on.

57:37.203 --> 57:40.456
- I'll hold the ladder. Come down.
- Something up there, I got to look.

57:40.623 --> 57:42.749
Micah! Oh, God.

57:46.004 --> 57:47.379
Micah, please be careful.

57:49.257 --> 57:50.799
Are you OK?

57:51.384 --> 57:56.096
Micah, answer me! 
Micah. Micah!

57:56.264 --> 57:59.016
- I'm fine.
- I'm com... Ah, thank God.

58:01.102 --> 58:02.102
Fuck.

58:04.647 --> 58:06.106
I found this up there.

58:07.609 --> 58:11.904
No. No, no, no, no.
Let me see that.

58:15.408 --> 58:17.910
- What're you talking about?
- This is our old house.

58:19.078 --> 58:21.580
What in the hell is this doing 
in the attic?

58:21.748 --> 58:24.166
I thought all that stuff burned down.

58:24.334 --> 58:28.045
There's no way. There is no way
you found that in our attic!

58:28.213 --> 58:30.255
There is no way that that even exists!

58:31.466 --> 58:33.509
I haven't seen that picture in 15 years.

58:34.552 --> 58:38.972
That makes no sense.
That makes no sense at all.

58:49.234 --> 58:50.359
You OK, babe?

58:52.445 --> 58:54.279
Would you turn the light off, please.

58:55.198 --> 58:56.323
Sorry.

59:00.328 --> 59:02.329
Where was it when you found it?

59:04.499 --> 59:06.124
It was over our bed.

59:14.133 --> 59:16.843
- I'm gonna go clean up that stuff.
- OK.

59:18.471 --> 59:21.056
I don't have any idea
if I'm gonna get to class today.

59:27.480 --> 59:29.314
Oh, God, I'm so tired.

59:29.482 --> 59:31.858
Why are you filming me?
I'm just making coffee.

59:33.987 --> 59:35.862
I'm actually sick of this.

59:38.866 --> 59:41.410
I think we could both use
a little more sleep.

59:41.578 --> 59:46.164
I think I could use a new life.
I'm so tired of this.

59:49.794 --> 59:52.087
- Take a look at this.
- Take a look at what?

59:52.255 --> 59:55.799
I lightened up the footage
from last night.

59:55.967 --> 59:57.759
You can see the footsteps.

01:00:01.598 --> 01:00:03.181
Oh, my God.

01:00:06.686 --> 01:00:09.104
- So?
- What?

01:00:09.272 --> 01:00:10.564
What are you gonna do?

01:00:15.695 --> 01:00:17.029
I don't know yet.

01:00:17.196 --> 01:00:19.489
Well, I do. 
We're calling Dr. Averies.

01:00:19.657 --> 01:00:22.492
You've had your camera work,
your powder on the floor,

01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:24.453
and it's just gotten worse, OK?

01:00:24.621 --> 01:00:29.708
We should've done this two weeks ago.
We're calling him. Today.

01:00:30.877 --> 01:00:34.171
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Let's talk about this first.

01:00:35.173 --> 01:00:37.841
Now, I'm in control,
think I'm making progress.

01:00:38.009 --> 01:00:41.219
No, you haven't been having progress 
and you're not in control!

01:00:41.387 --> 01:00:43.513
It is in control.
If you think you're in control,

01:00:43.681 --> 01:00:45.349
- you're an idiot!
- Hey! Stay cool.

01:00:45.516 --> 01:00:46.892
Not a single thing
you've done has helped.

01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:49.311
And I'm sorry, 
I don't mean to burst your bubble,

01:00:49.479 --> 01:00:52.105
but the camera hasn't helped,
the footprints haven't helped.

01:00:52.273 --> 01:00:55.108
Think that thing would've left footprints 
if it didn't want to?

01:00:55.276 --> 01:00:58.153
No! It did it because it wanted to.
It wanted you to find my photo.

01:00:58.321 --> 01:01:00.656
It can be anywhere.
It hears what we're saying now.

01:01:00.823 --> 01:01:04.368
- Hey! How the fuck do you know?
- You are absolutely powerless!

01:01:04.535 --> 01:01:06.745
That's not true at all and you know it.

01:01:06.913 --> 01:01:08.372
Well, get over it!

01:01:12.794 --> 01:01:17.047
Well, I called Dr. Averies
and he's gone.

01:01:17.215 --> 01:01:19.591
Didn't know what else to do,
so I called Dr. Fredrichs.

01:01:19.759 --> 01:01:21.510
I know you don't love him, but I did.

01:01:21.678 --> 01:01:25.639
And he's coming back tomorrow.
That was as soon as he could get here.

01:01:25.807 --> 01:01:28.433
So maybe if we make it till then,
we could hold off...

01:01:28.601 --> 01:01:31.019
- We'll make it till then!
- I'm just saying that we could just...

01:01:31.187 --> 01:01:34.940
- "Make it till then." God!
- We could hold out, we'll be OK,

01:01:35.108 --> 01:01:40.946
- and maybe tomorrow he'll help us.
- Fucking people! Ridiculous.

01:02:19.318 --> 01:02:20.819
Fuck!

01:02:20.987 --> 01:02:21.987
What happened?

01:02:22.155 --> 01:02:24.239
What're you doing? 
Micah.

01:02:24.407 --> 01:02:26.366
What're you doing? 
What'd you hear?

01:02:26.534 --> 01:02:28.285
Something out there.

01:02:29.328 --> 01:02:31.788
- Fuck!
- Oh, God.

01:02:31.956 --> 01:02:33.039
Goddamn it!

01:02:33.207 --> 01:02:35.917
Baby, come here. 
Please don't go...

01:02:36.085 --> 01:02:40.630
Please, just stay, please. 
Don't go.

01:02:42.341 --> 01:02:43.717
I'm going out there and see...

01:02:43.885 --> 01:02:47.387
Wait, Micah, don't go. 
Don't, please.

01:02:47.555 --> 01:02:50.640
Please. Please don't open it.

01:02:53.019 --> 01:02:55.520
Micah, come on. Come on.

01:02:55.688 --> 01:02:58.774
Right now. Come on. Micah.

01:03:04.864 --> 01:03:06.198
Who's there?

01:03:09.452 --> 01:03:11.787
- Baby, come on!
- You gonna fuck with us?

01:03:16.918 --> 01:03:20.378
Micah, don't. Come on. Let's go.

01:03:20.546 --> 01:03:22.047
Show yourself!

01:03:23.549 --> 01:03:26.384
Come on, Micah. Let's go.
We've got to get out.

01:03:26.552 --> 01:03:29.971
- Got a problem?
- Stop!

01:03:30.139 --> 01:03:31.890
All right, hon, I'm sorry.

01:03:37.772 --> 01:03:39.314
Micah...

01:03:47.657 --> 01:03:49.449
Please let go of it.

01:03:52.912 --> 01:03:54.579
Oh, it's scaring us.

01:03:55.414 --> 01:03:56.998
Hey.

01:03:59.252 --> 01:04:01.920
- Not gonna make a difference.
- I'm not going in that bedroom.

01:04:02.088 --> 01:04:03.922
- Look...
- I'm not going in that bedroom.

01:04:04.090 --> 01:04:06.424
- Oh, please, please...
- Baby, look, if it comes back...

01:04:06.592 --> 01:04:08.718
No, downstairs. 
Let's just... Please.

01:04:09.929 --> 01:04:13.390
Babe... 
It's not gonna make a difference.

01:04:13.558 --> 01:04:15.183
- I can't...
- Come on.

01:04:15.351 --> 01:04:17.769
I don't wanna be in here.
I don't wanna be even downstairs.

01:04:17.937 --> 01:04:20.438
Please, please...
Please, please. Please.

01:04:20.606 --> 01:04:22.649
All right.

01:04:28.698 --> 01:04:30.699
What the hell is in here now?

01:04:33.411 --> 01:04:36.121
I don't know if down here
is gonna be much better.

01:04:40.001 --> 01:04:44.754
Micah. I don't want to be here.

01:04:56.642 --> 01:05:00.979
I think we should go upstairs.
Again. Come here.

01:05:20.124 --> 01:05:21.374
Katie?

01:05:24.921 --> 01:05:26.296
Babe?

01:05:34.513 --> 01:05:38.725
You know, gotta get some sleep
once in a while.

01:05:39.810 --> 01:05:41.853
I'm just scared.

01:05:44.148 --> 01:05:46.566
I couldn't be in that room anymore.

01:05:51.197 --> 01:05:52.864
I understand.

01:05:53.783 --> 01:05:56.284
I can't even be in this house, Micah.

01:05:58.412 --> 01:06:00.622
We can't even be in our house.

01:06:20.559 --> 01:06:22.435
What the fuck is that?

01:06:30.945 --> 01:06:32.278
I'll check the mirrors.

01:06:40.287 --> 01:06:41.830
Our picture!

01:06:44.417 --> 01:06:46.376
- What picture?
- That one, look!

01:06:49.338 --> 01:06:53.299
Fuck! What the hell?

01:06:53.467 --> 01:06:55.927
How come my face is scratched
and yours isn't?

01:06:56.095 --> 01:06:58.096
Something's here.

01:06:59.765 --> 01:07:02.308
- This is bullshit.
- It's here.

01:07:02.476 --> 01:07:07.147
What's here? What?
What're you talking about?

01:07:07.314 --> 01:07:12.277
I don't know. I feel it.
I feel it breathing on me.

01:07:14.488 --> 01:07:18.199
Micah, come on! Come on! Please!

01:07:20.077 --> 01:07:22.120
Fuckin'-A, man.

01:07:25.875 --> 01:07:28.209
Fuckin'-A.

01:07:31.964 --> 01:07:35.759
- Babe. Come downstairs.
- Jesus Christ.

01:07:35.926 --> 01:07:37.260
Come on.

01:07:44.518 --> 01:07:46.936
Has this shit happened
in the daytime before?

01:07:50.441 --> 01:07:51.983
It's getting worse.

01:07:53.652 --> 01:07:54.986
Fuck.

01:07:57.656 --> 01:08:00.700
- Hey, baby, stop pacing, please.
- I'm sorry.

01:08:00.868 --> 01:08:03.369
- It's making me nervous.
- Well, I'm nervous.

01:08:07.625 --> 01:08:08.625
Katie, hi.

01:08:08.793 --> 01:08:11.503
Hi, come in, please.
Thank you so much for coming back.

01:08:11.670 --> 01:08:13.505
Oh, we've gotta follow up.
Micah, hi.

01:08:13.672 --> 01:08:15.757
Yeah. We called Dr. Averies,
but he's gone.

01:08:15.925 --> 01:08:18.718
Yes, he's out of the country.
He'll be back. He'll be... Wow.

01:08:18.886 --> 01:08:20.929
- We need your help.
- This is overpowering.

01:08:21.096 --> 01:08:23.348
- It's worse.
- Yes. It doesn't like that I'm here.

01:08:23.515 --> 01:08:24.849
- I cannot help you.
- What?

01:08:25.017 --> 01:08:27.644
I've got to get out of here. This thing
is aggravated by the fact that I'm here.

01:08:27.812 --> 01:08:29.145
You can't leave us alone here.

01:08:29.313 --> 01:08:31.147
Everybody calm down.
We need your help.

01:08:31.314 --> 01:08:34.567
Well, I've got to tell you, I am not the person 
to help you in this situation.

01:08:34.734 --> 01:08:36.694
This is not my area of expertise.

01:08:36.862 --> 01:08:39.697
Now, I think I'm doing more harm
being here than any good.

01:08:39.865 --> 01:08:41.366
- What?
- Yes, I have got to leave.

01:08:41.533 --> 01:08:43.243
Dr. Averies will be back in a few days.

01:08:43.410 --> 01:08:45.620
When he gets here
he'll take care of your problems.

01:08:45.787 --> 01:08:47.872
What should we do?
Should we leave?

01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:49.374
Leaving won't help at all.

01:08:49.542 --> 01:08:51.792
Let me see what I can do.
But I've got to leave this room now.

01:08:51.961 --> 01:08:54.379
- This is no joke.
- I will help you.

01:08:54.546 --> 01:08:56.464
- But I can't do this now.
- No, no, no, no!

01:08:56.631 --> 01:08:58.299
You serious?

01:09:02.638 --> 01:09:04.721
We'll take care of this ourselves, OK?

01:09:04.890 --> 01:09:06.558
Katie?

01:09:09.603 --> 01:09:10.854
Fuck.

01:09:25.911 --> 01:09:27.620
I'm so fucking tired of this.

01:09:30.082 --> 01:09:32.332
I know you are.

01:09:35.962 --> 01:09:38.006
I don't want it to be like this.

01:11:05.552 --> 01:11:08.930
- Micah! Micah, wake up.
- What's the matter?

01:11:09.098 --> 01:11:11.975
I just...
I just felt him breathing.

01:11:14.019 --> 01:11:15.853
Right there.
He was right there,

01:11:16.021 --> 01:11:17.230
I felt him breathing.

01:11:22.111 --> 01:11:24.070
What are you doing?

01:11:29.410 --> 01:11:31.035
Where're you going?
Micah, come back!

01:11:31.203 --> 01:11:32.203
I'm not going anywhere.

01:11:32.371 --> 01:11:35.290
Chill. There's nothing happening.

01:11:35.457 --> 01:11:38.293
I know, I'm telling you.
I'm telling you.

01:11:38.460 --> 01:11:39.460
I... Please.

01:11:39.628 --> 01:11:43.214
OK, OK.
I won't leave you.

01:11:44.341 --> 01:11:45.633
Don't you feel it?

01:11:47.511 --> 01:11:49.721
I feel it, he's still here.

01:11:49.888 --> 01:11:51.556
Something, something's wrong.

01:11:53.475 --> 01:11:55.059
Take a deep breath, OK?

01:12:10.284 --> 01:12:12.285
I can feel it watching me.

01:12:14.830 --> 01:12:16.247
Right now.

01:12:17.458 --> 01:12:19.375
Fuck. You're freaking me out, babe.

01:12:19.543 --> 01:12:21.711
- We have to do something.
- What?

01:12:21.879 --> 01:12:24.589
I don't know.
We've got to figure something out.

01:12:24.757 --> 01:12:28.176
- We have to...
- OK. OK, OK.

01:12:28.344 --> 01:12:29.344
I'll figure something out.

01:12:29.511 --> 01:12:32.430
I'll do some research.
There's gotta be some other options.

01:12:34.767 --> 01:12:36.142
OK.

01:12:41.273 --> 01:12:42.982
- Jesus.
- This is creepy.

01:12:43.150 --> 01:12:45.943
I knew something happened last night.

01:12:48.947 --> 01:12:51.157
Ah, shit.

01:12:52.618 --> 01:12:56.120
We've got to do something.
I can feel something's wrong.

01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:06.130
So I was doing some research,
just trying to figure out our options.

01:13:06.298 --> 01:13:08.966
- Right.
- I found this website.

01:13:09.134 --> 01:13:12.595
This chick, Diane, one of
the possibilities from the board?

01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:15.390
Yeah.

01:13:15.557 --> 01:13:18.976
All the same things happened to her
in the 60's that's happened to you.

01:13:19.144 --> 01:13:21.145
Wait. What do you mean
she has the same things?

01:13:21.313 --> 01:13:25.149
Like everything. You're eight years old
and like you had a house burning down,

01:13:25.317 --> 01:13:31.322
seeing shadows and whatever.
God knows. And she called an exorcist.

01:13:32.533 --> 01:13:33.950
Is that her?

01:13:34.118 --> 01:13:36.494
You're telling me there's some girl 
from the 60's

01:13:36.662 --> 01:13:39.622
who had the exact same things
happen to her.

01:13:39.790 --> 01:13:44.919
Yeah. Down to a T. You say...
Maybe this thing is the same thing.

01:13:45.087 --> 01:13:48.965
It just jumped to you instead.
And that's just its m.o., or whatever.

01:13:49.133 --> 01:13:50.716
And he's trying to warn us,

01:13:50.884 --> 01:13:55.138
with this Ouija board, trying to tell us
to find this woman so we know...

01:13:55.305 --> 01:13:57.765
Wait. So what happened to her?
Is she OK?

01:13:58.809 --> 01:14:03.229
They tried to get rid of it,
sometimes that just pisses it off more.

01:14:04.690 --> 01:14:08.151
Before the exorcist got there,
she wasn't like this.

01:14:08.318 --> 01:14:11.654
She was just hearing voices
and having bad dreams.

01:14:12.364 --> 01:14:14.365
I'm trying to find some kind of reason

01:14:14.533 --> 01:14:17.785
this thing would pick you
after haunting her.

01:14:17.953 --> 01:14:19.704
I can't find anything.

01:14:19.872 --> 01:14:22.498
From what I've been reading,
these things are totally random.

01:14:22.666 --> 01:14:25.209
- There's just no reason. Like...
- How did she die?

01:14:28.213 --> 01:14:29.797
She's pretty.

01:14:29.965 --> 01:14:33.050
Now she is. 
I think this thing's trying to warn us

01:14:33.218 --> 01:14:37.013
not to fuck with it.
I don't want to take a chance.

01:14:38.557 --> 01:14:40.308
Oh, God!

01:14:42.436 --> 01:14:44.270
There's no way that we're doing this.

01:14:44.438 --> 01:14:47.064
It's gone away on its own before.

01:14:47.232 --> 01:14:49.275
This is not worth the risk.

01:14:50.777 --> 01:14:52.487
I'm gonna go lie down.

01:14:58.911 --> 01:15:01.996
Hey, Katie, I got a idea
about what we can do.

01:15:02.164 --> 01:15:03.915
Some more stuff. In fact...

01:15:04.082 --> 01:15:07.585
Would you please get away from me
with that camera? I'm trying to study.

01:15:08.754 --> 01:15:11.756
All right. I kinda want to talk to you 
about this thing.

01:15:11.924 --> 01:15:15.092
Micah, please.
Will you give me five minutes?

01:15:16.428 --> 01:15:17.595
Go! Please!

01:15:17.763 --> 01:15:21.265
Hey, chill out! All right?
I'm trying to help this situation here.

01:15:21.433 --> 01:15:23.100
I have ideas I want to talk to you about.

01:15:23.268 --> 01:15:25.728
OK, you and your stupid camera 
are the problem.

01:15:26.855 --> 01:15:29.232
- What the fuck?!
- Just leave me alone.

01:15:29.399 --> 01:15:32.109
Will you stop following me 
with the camera!

01:15:32.277 --> 01:15:35.905
I'm trying to solve the problem.
I didn't bring that thing to the house.

01:15:36.073 --> 01:15:38.199
- Well, don't do me any favors.
- You did!

01:15:39.743 --> 01:15:42.745
Thank you, Micah.
Thank you so much.

01:15:42.913 --> 01:15:46.040
Well, hang out with your friend upstairs. 
I'll be down here.

01:15:46.208 --> 01:15:48.918
- Shut up!
- Whatever.

01:15:58.220 --> 01:15:59.220
Hey.

01:16:03.392 --> 01:16:06.477
- I'm sorry.
- You didn't do anything wrong.

01:16:07.771 --> 01:16:09.313
You didn't do anything wrong.

01:16:09.481 --> 01:16:12.400
It's not your fault.
Now listen to me, it's not your fault.

01:16:12.568 --> 01:16:14.735
You haven't done anything wrong.

01:16:14.903 --> 01:16:16.737
OK?

01:16:46.476 --> 01:16:48.519
Micah. Micah! Micah!

01:16:48.687 --> 01:16:50.855
Micah! Micah!

01:16:51.023 --> 01:16:52.815
- Katie!
- Micah!

01:16:58.447 --> 01:17:00.615
Let her go!

01:17:05.829 --> 01:17:08.247
Micah! Micah!

01:17:09.541 --> 01:17:11.292
Micah, make it stop!

01:17:39.029 --> 01:17:41.530
I don't care, I just want to go.
I just want to go.

01:17:41.698 --> 01:17:44.450
I can't... I can't,
I can't be here. I can't.

01:17:44.618 --> 01:17:46.702
Just, let's go. 
Please, let's go.

01:17:46.870 --> 01:17:49.580
Let's just go right now.
Let's get in the car and let's go.

01:17:50.749 --> 01:17:55.169
Yeah. All right, we're leaving.
I'll get us a hotel.

01:17:55.337 --> 01:17:58.464
We'll stay there tonight,
until we figure out what we're doing.

01:17:59.257 --> 01:18:01.217
We're not staying here another night.

01:18:02.511 --> 01:18:04.970
Here, let me get a shot of that thing
it made on your back.

01:18:05.138 --> 01:18:07.431
OK? Is that OK?

01:18:15.607 --> 01:18:17.942
Oh, Jesus!

01:18:21.363 --> 01:18:24.615
- Sorry. Looks like something bit you!
- I know.

01:18:28.036 --> 01:18:29.578
Let's go.

01:18:30.580 --> 01:18:32.581
Hey! Baby, you ready to go?

01:18:32.958 --> 01:18:36.669
Car's packed. Let's go. 
Hey, babe?

01:18:39.423 --> 01:18:41.340
Babe, hey!

01:18:45.971 --> 01:18:49.181
Babe. Let go of this thing.
Hey! Let go.

01:18:50.976 --> 01:18:52.977
Jesus Christ.

01:18:57.357 --> 01:18:59.984
Babe? Oh my God!

01:19:00.152 --> 01:19:04.613
Hey. Katie! Katie! Wake up.

01:19:04.781 --> 01:19:09.452
Jesus. I've had it with this shit!

01:19:13.331 --> 01:19:16.542
Babe! Come on, let's go.

01:19:17.335 --> 01:19:21.881
Let's get you up. Come on.
Hey. Come on. Come on.

01:19:22.591 --> 01:19:23.674
Let's get to the couch.

01:19:24.509 --> 01:19:28.512
Come on. I've had it with this shit.

01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:31.223
I'm taking care of this right now!

01:19:48.283 --> 01:19:50.242
Fuck this shit, I'm done!

01:19:56.583 --> 01:20:00.836
Katie. Ready to go?
Let's get out of here.

01:20:02.255 --> 01:20:03.255
Babe?

01:20:03.423 --> 01:20:04.965
I packed the car. Let's go.

01:20:05.884 --> 01:20:07.259
I don't want to go.

01:20:07.427 --> 01:20:09.845
What're you talking about,
you don't want to go?

01:20:10.013 --> 01:20:11.764
Let's get the fuck
outta this house, now!

01:20:11.932 --> 01:20:15.559
I don't want to leave.
Will you stay with me?

01:20:15.727 --> 01:20:21.232
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- I think it'd be better if we stay.

01:20:21.399 --> 01:20:24.151
Please. Just...

01:20:24.319 --> 01:20:27.905
I don't want to go.
I don't want to leave. Just trust me.

01:20:28.073 --> 01:20:30.241
You wanna stay here
and sleep in this fucking bed

01:20:30.408 --> 01:20:32.535
and be dragged down the hall?
I don't think so.

01:20:32.702 --> 01:20:35.079
We'll be... We'll be OK.
It's better if we stay.

01:20:36.164 --> 01:20:37.581
You fucking...

01:20:39.918 --> 01:20:44.255
I don't know what the hell's going on,
but this is insane. Fuck!

01:20:49.886 --> 01:20:52.012
I think we'll be OK now.

01:23:00.433 --> 01:23:04.353
- Micah!
- Katie!

01:23:07.440 --> 01:23:09.400
What's the matter, honey?

01:23:11.653 --> 01:23:12.820
Oh, my God!
