Chem-7, CBC, LFTs
and an abdominal ultrasound .

02:52.109 --> 02:54.077
-An ultrasound?
-Could be appendicitis.

02:54.243 --> 02:56.576

Cancel the CBC, Chem-7,
LFTs and ultrasound .

03:17.370 --> 03:20.237
-What's your diagnosis?
-Probably gastroenteritis.

03:20.406 --> 03:23.341
Why order $ 1 000 worth of tests?

03:23.510 --> 03:25.842
-To rule out appendicitis.
-lt's ruled out.

03:26.012 --> 03:27.844
He has pain
in the right lower quadrant.

03:28.015 --> 03:30.779
So would you if you were full of gas.

03:31.852 --> 03:35.914
Sir, go home and take nothing
by mouth for six hours.

03:36.090 --> 03:39.958

than we can give you .

04:49.038 --> 04:53.339
You need to have someone around all
the time to make sure that you're okay.

04:55.379 --> 04:59.008
We found this great place.
The Melville Home.

05:03.955 --> 05:07.516
We'll make it just as nice
as your house, Mama.

05:07.692 --> 05:12.926
-Jackie's gonna make you curtains.
-Yellow stripes, your favorite.

05:16.235 --> 05:18.932
Do l have to go, Peter?

05:23.010 --> 05:24.671
Yeah, Ma.

05:25.613 --> 05:27.045
You do.

06:27.214 --> 06:30.343
-Swift was way out of line.
-He was right.

06:30.518 --> 06:32.509
-You should talk to him.
-What for?

06:32.687 --> 06:36.054
-You still want the attending?
-He's made up his mind .

06:36.858 --> 06:39.725
-What do we have?
-What do you want for bloods?

06:39.895 --> 06:44.390
He works for the electric company. Took
a 20-foot fall . High-current burns.

06:44.567 --> 06:47.093
Doug, thanks.
Let's start a central line.

06:47.271 --> 06:49.705
Okay, Carter, over here.

06:49.873 --> 06:51.738
-Ever done a central line?
-l've seen one.

06:51.908 --> 06:54.172
You're gonna do one now.

06:54.344 --> 06:57.576
Put the long 1 4-gauge
on the 6cc syringe.

06:58.783 --> 07:01.308
Prep 5 migs morphine.

07:02.554 --> 07:07.548
-Give him a liter of Ringer's first.
-Aim at the sternal notch .

07:07.727 --> 07:10.525
Now you have blood refill .
Remove the syringe.

07:10.696 --> 07:14.133
-Will do.
-And feed the guide wire through .

07:14.301 --> 07:17.134
Lucky guy. No ST changes.

07:18.571 --> 07:22.064
-Slide it into the subclavia.
-You want a tetanus?

07:22.243 --> 07:24.734
-300ccs Ringer's.
-He needs a Foley.

07:24.912 --> 07:28.007
-Here are the x-rays.
-They'll do that upstairs.

07:28.182 --> 07:31.744
We have enough guide wire left
to pull it through .

07:31.920 --> 07:34.445
-You're doing a central line?
-Yep .

07:34.990 --> 07:36.788
Now get an x-ray
to check the placement.

07:38.160 --> 07:41.324
-Excellent.
-Get him ready for transfer.

07:41.497 --> 07:44.193
-Talk to me.
-He fell from a utility pole.

07:44.367 --> 07:47.700
Circumferential third-degree burns
to upper extremities.

07:47.871 --> 07:51.467
No cardiac changes. C-spine,
chest, pelvis all negative.

07:51.642 --> 07:54.839
-No long bone fractures.
-Let's get him up .

08:04.890 --> 08:08.884
-Any fever, Mrs. Ryan?
-Just the headache and dizziness.

08:09.061 --> 08:12.759
-l think l'm going to throw up .
-And nausea.

08:12.932 --> 08:15.834
We'll get you fixed up right away.

08:18.739 --> 08:23.200
-What's wrong with her, doctor?
-lt's probably just a flu bug .

08:23.378 --> 08:26.348
Her heart rate is a little fast,
so we'll run some tests.

08:26.514 --> 08:29.677
Put her on a monitor
and let's check a rhythm strip .

08:29.852 --> 08:32.284
-A monitor?
-Yeah, a heart monitor.

08:32.453 --> 08:36.982
-ls it that serious?
-We'll just keep our eye on her.

08:37.159 --> 08:41.187
Are these tests gonna cost
a lot of money?

08:41.364 --> 08:44.561
-You have insurance, don't you?
-No.

08:44.735 --> 08:46.895
We'll work something out.

08:48.872 --> 08:51.638
How long have you had that cough?

08:53.911 --> 08:58.747
-You can give me medicine, okay?
-How long, Mrs. Salazar?

08:58.917 --> 09:00.851
A week. Two.

09:01.019 --> 09:04.319
Have you been coughing
anything up, like blood?

09:04.489 --> 09:06.958
lt's not so bad . l have to go.

09:07.126 --> 09:10.254
Could you have been exposed
to tuberculosis?

09:10.430 --> 09:13.297
-Tuberculosis?
-l don't know what you mean .

09:13.467 --> 09:18.838
Does anyone else in your family have
this cough? Anybody you work with?

09:19.006 --> 09:21.998
<i>l don't work, okay?
Mi esposo has green card, he work.</i>

09:22.177 --> 09:24.611
My children are at home, l need to go.

09:24.779 --> 09:29.682
Have any of them been sick?
Fevers? Night sweats?

09:30.819 --> 09:33.550
My daughter. l have to go home.

09:33.722 --> 09:36.054
<i>Mi madre, she take care
of her now.</i>

09:36.226 --> 09:41.562
lf your daughter's sick and you have
tuberculosis, we need to see her.

09:41.731 --> 09:46.361
lt's very contagious. l can't
make you stay, Mrs. Salazar.

09:46.536 --> 09:50.803
But l would strongly advise you
to take these tests.

09:50.976 --> 09:53.000
No questions asked, okay?

09:57.349 --> 10:00.409
Okay, l stay a little bit.

10:04.324 --> 10:08.852
-What's she so afraid of?
-She's probably illegal .

10:09.028 --> 10:13.362
Lydia? We gotta get Mrs. Salazar
into an isolation room.

10:13.533 --> 10:17.198
She needs a chest x-ray,
acid-fast stain and sputum culture.

10:17.371 --> 10:20.204
-Carter, try and find her a mask.
-Sure.

10:21.576 --> 10:26.479
Stay away from me, Shirley.
You could've killed Mr. Munchy.

10:26.648 --> 10:30.380
lt was your fault, Sari .
You said the road was clear.

10:30.553 --> 10:34.011
Didn't say it would stay that way.
l told you to step on it.

10:34.190 --> 10:37.921
-lt's not safe to speed .
-You were going five miles an hour!

10:38.095 --> 10:42.191
-Shut up ! This is all your fault!
-Two sisters. Slow-moving MVA.

10:42.366 --> 10:45.426
One with a nose lac,
the other dizzy with headache.

10:45.602 --> 10:47.696
The only danger they're in
is from each other.

10:47.872 --> 10:49.304
Thanks.

10:53.012 --> 10:55.572
Somebody, help ! Please, please!

10:56.381 --> 10:58.714
-Narrow complex tachycardia.
-Rate 200.

10:58.884 --> 11:02.980
Start a line and give O-2.
Get the crash cart now!

11:03.155 --> 11:06.250
-My God ! What's happening?
-You're gonna have to stay back.

11:06.426 --> 11:10.055
-BP's 70 over 50.
-Give me some adenosine.

11:10.230 --> 11:13.564
Janette, you have to help me out.
Blow on your thumb.

11:13.733 --> 11:15.964
Blow on it really hard .

11:16.137 --> 11:18.833
-Two milligrams of adenosine?
-Three, lV push .

11:19.006 --> 11:22.306
-There's no BP.
-l can't feel a pulse.

11:22.476 --> 11:26.573
She's out. Set it on 50.
Hit the synch switch .

11:26.748 --> 11:29.843
-Turn up the O-2, 1 5 liters.
-Stand back.

11:32.722 --> 11:36.283
She's in V-fib. Turn off the synch
and charge to 1 00 joules.

11:36.459 --> 11:38.256
-Clear?
-Clear.

11:39.463 --> 11:42.660
-l get a BP. 1 00 over 60.
-Normal sinus rhythm.

11:42.833 --> 11:46.565
-Pulse bounding .
-lt means she's okay.

11:48.373 --> 11:50.898
Welcome back, kiddo.

11:51.076 --> 11:53.442
You're gonna be okay.
Your mom's right here.

11:53.612 --> 11:55.637
You're fine.

11:56.849 --> 12:00.945
A-R-Q-P-T-X.

12:01.121 --> 12:03.919
That was completely wrong .

12:04.091 --> 12:07.322
Why don't you try the same line
with your glasses?

12:07.494 --> 12:10.054
Oh, yes.

12:13.334 --> 12:15.325
Here we go.

12:15.503 --> 12:21.874
N-T-O-A-W-R.

12:25.981 --> 12:30.282
Damn it, Shirley. l can't see squat.
l'm gonna kill you .

12:30.452 --> 12:35.322
We've lived together for 50 years
and l'm not dead yet. You're a bully!

12:35.492 --> 12:39.793
-Now l'm blind . Are you happ y?
-Ladies, please.

12:39.964 --> 12:43.092
-She's no lady.
-Hold still .

12:44.101 --> 12:48.698
l'm concerned about your vision and
headache. You need a C AT scan .

12:48.873 --> 12:51.365
Which glasses are yours?

12:51.543 --> 12:54.011
How should l know? l can't see.

12:54.179 --> 12:55.908
Why don't you try these?

12:57.150 --> 12:58.811
Here.

13:08.762 --> 13:10.822
l thought you'd be older.

13:17.439 --> 13:20.169
-Young man . . . .
-Just one second .

13:21.410 --> 13:24.573
Carter. Got a procedure
for your book.

13:24.746 --> 13:27.478
-Pelvic.
-l already have a ton of pelvics.

13:27.651 --> 13:30.051
Lady asked for you personally.

13:30.220 --> 13:33.485
l'm so thirsty. Some water, please.

13:35.992 --> 13:37.927
There you go.

13:53.646 --> 13:57.877
So Janette has supraventricular
tachycardia.

13:58.051 --> 14:00.577
Like a short circuit in her heart.

14:00.754 --> 14:04.384
So she needs to be admitted
into Cardiology.

14:04.558 --> 14:10.361
Someone from Social Services
will help you apply for Medicaid .

14:14.202 --> 14:16.898
Your daughter's gonna be fine,
Mrs. Ryan .

14:17.906 --> 14:19.601
Just fine.

14:20.509 --> 14:23.137
-Lunch later?
-Yeah, sure.

14:23.312 --> 14:27.339
-Cafeteria or the vending machines?
-Doesn't matter.

14:27.517 --> 14:30.351
Wild Willie wants you
to see the lady in Three.

14:30.521 --> 14:34.582
-Have you talked to him yet?
-No. Don't plan to.

14:34.758 --> 14:39.423
She's in her 8th month . Has
stomach cramps, frequent urination .

14:43.668 --> 14:46.501
-Why don't you take it?
-Why?

14:46.671 --> 14:48.902
Because l asked you to.

14:53.046 --> 14:56.242
-Do l know you from someplace?
-No.

14:56.415 --> 15:00.648
-Why did you ask to see me?
-You treated my friend Barbara.

15:00.822 --> 15:03.484
She recommended you .

15:03.658 --> 15:06.684
The truth is l don't really have cramps.

15:09.297 --> 15:11.765
Why are you here, Mrs. Blum?

15:13.068 --> 15:16.731
Barbara has been trying
to have a baby for years.

15:16.905 --> 15:22.071
Last month she came in with cramps
and you examined her.

15:22.245 --> 15:25.043
And the very next week
she got pregnant.

15:25.281 --> 15:29.240
-Did l have something to do with it?
-Barbara thinks so.

15:29.419 --> 15:34.414
When she heard that we were trying
she said, ''Go and see Dr. Carter.

15:34.625 --> 15:37.059
He's got the magic touch !''

15:38.829 --> 15:40.627
Dr. Greene?

15:44.035 --> 15:46.902
Your name's on the board
for that pregnant woman .

15:47.073 --> 15:50.941
-Why is Dr. Lewis with her?
-l gave it to her.

15:53.247 --> 15:54.907
l see.

15:56.283 --> 16:00.014
l understand you lost
a mother during delivery.

16:00.188 --> 16:03.486
Jodi O' Brien . Preeclampsia.
She bled out.

16:03.658 --> 16:06.821
l'd like you to present it
at the case conference today.

16:06.995 --> 16:09.897
-Two o'clock.
-l need time to prepare.

16:10.064 --> 16:12.862
No, you don't.
You know what happened .

16:21.777 --> 16:25.714
Mrs. Salazar, your tests
are positive for tuberculosis.

16:25.882 --> 16:29.114
We need to get your family in here
as soon as possible.

16:30.021 --> 16:32.717
<i>-l bring them mañana.
-No, today, Mrs. Salazar.</i>

16:32.890 --> 16:36.326
You shouldn't leave the hospital .
You're very sick.

16:36.494 --> 16:39.589
l feel better, really. l can go.

16:39.765 --> 16:44.202
Do you understand the seriousness
of your illness?

16:44.369 --> 16:48.032
l don't care if you're illegal . l want
to make sure your kids are okay.

16:48.207 --> 16:52.701
-They're fine.
-You'll infect everybody around you .

16:52.879 --> 16:56.907
-Your children, people you work with .
-Dr. Greene.

16:57.084 --> 17:01.214
Your family needs to come in
and be seen in this hospital !

17:01.389 --> 17:02.821
Mark.

17:08.363 --> 17:10.455
What's the matter with you?

17:10.632 --> 17:14.898
She's leaving with TB.
l'm not supposed to be angry?

17:15.069 --> 17:18.769
-She can't trust you if you scream.
-l wasn't screaming .

17:18.941 --> 17:23.378
-Now you're screaming at me.
-Forget it. lf she leaves, she leaves.

17:27.984 --> 17:31.478
Well, rule out sepsis.
We made a suprapubic tap .

17:31.655 --> 17:35.023
-You're kidding?
-Step right up, doc.

17:36.561 --> 17:39.224
-Temp's 1 02.
-Any luck with the urine?

17:39.397 --> 17:43.129
l gave him four ounces of clear fluid
and then four more.

17:43.302 --> 17:46.830
Eight ounces? Dry as a bone.

17:47.007 --> 17:50.636
-lsn't there some other way?
-This is the easiest way.

17:50.810 --> 17:53.780
Carter, swab the area.

17:53.947 --> 17:57.247
Hold the syringe in one hand .
lt's okay, kiddo.

17:57.418 --> 18:00.114
-Palpate the pubic symphysis.
-What now?

18:00.287 --> 18:03.848
We use a small needle
to get a urine sample.

18:04.025 --> 18:07.962
-Careful not to push too hard .
-How do you know it's too hard?

18:09.664 --> 18:11.360
That's probably too hard .

18:15.471 --> 18:18.804
-Your husband brought you in?
-The old fuddy-duddy.

18:18.976 --> 18:24.346
He thinks l have paranoid psychosis
with elaborated delusional systems.

18:24.515 --> 18:26.848
He reads too much, that's all .

18:27.985 --> 18:31.752
-Do you ever hear voices?
-Of course not.

18:31.922 --> 18:34.619
-Ever have frightening thoughts?
-No.

18:34.793 --> 18:36.727
Are you afraid
someone will harm you?

18:37.062 --> 18:41.693
Of course. Streets aren't safe
nowadays, are they?

18:42.835 --> 18:48.432
-Do you have a psychiatrist?
-Yes. Would you like his number?

18:48.608 --> 18:51.202
Let's see, where did l put it?

18:53.747 --> 18:56.012
Just give me a second here.

18:58.686 --> 19:00.415
Yikes. . . .

19:00.588 --> 19:03.022
SlG Sauer 228.

19:03.191 --> 19:07.322
Nine millimeter double action,
1 3-round clip .

19:08.964 --> 19:11.399
Little heavy, but lethal .

19:11.568 --> 19:15.902
Would you mind if l gave this
to Security, just for now?

19:16.072 --> 19:18.063
Not at all .

19:18.241 --> 19:20.607
l've still got the Beretta.

19:24.380 --> 19:27.578
-Still here?
-Waiting for the ambulance.

19:27.751 --> 19:31.209
-How are you, Ma?
-She's been quiet.

19:31.389 --> 19:33.857
Let me talk to her.

19:35.227 --> 19:38.595
Ma, you're gonna like the place.
l saw it.

19:38.764 --> 19:42.700
lt's nice and clean . You have
your own TV in your room.

19:43.803 --> 19:46.863
There's a little courtyard outside.

19:52.880 --> 19:56.874
l've got surgery.
Jeanie's gonna go with you now.

19:57.051 --> 19:59.212
l'll come by later, okay?

20:02.124 --> 20:04.455
l love you, Ma.

20:05.628 --> 20:07.562
We're ready.

20:50.177 --> 20:52.077
-Hey.
-Here, Dr. Greene.

20:52.246 --> 20:57.014
-Conference? Are you nervous?
-No. l love an inquisition .

20:57.185 --> 21:00.086
-You'll do fine.
-Are you kidding?

21:00.255 --> 21:03.554
-They'll be out for blood .
-We've all been there.

21:03.725 --> 21:07.093
How many young mothers
have you killed, Doug?

21:07.262 --> 21:09.925
Mark, listen . Hey.

21:10.100 --> 21:14.560
Sorry l can't be there today,
but you're gonna do okay.

21:14.738 --> 21:16.569
Good luck.

21:24.282 --> 21:25.977
Excuse me?

21:26.150 --> 21:30.110
-ls there a conference here at two?
-Not enough space. lt's moved .

21:30.289 --> 21:33.349
-Oh, yeah? What room?
-The auditorium.

21:33.524 --> 21:38.360
-Finger lac in Two.
-l have to finish the med renewals.

21:38.530 --> 21:42.592
-Got enough lacs in your book?
-l told you l'm busy.

21:42.769 --> 21:46.535
Carter, why in the hell
did you give Mrs. Baba water?

21:46.707 --> 21:48.607
-The lady in Two.
-She was thirsty.

21:48.776 --> 21:53.270
She was NPO . Scheduled for
surgery. No food, no water.

21:53.447 --> 21:56.542
-She was your gallbladder patient?
-Just read the chart.

21:56.718 --> 21:59.881
Now, because of you
she can't have surgery.

22:00.055 --> 22:03.752
l'm doing a small bowel .
Chen, scrub in .

22:05.128 --> 22:08.325
To the O .R.? Really?

22:13.771 --> 22:15.500
Good, you're here.

22:16.674 --> 22:18.733
l hope it's instructive.

22:20.644 --> 22:23.044
For the other residents.

22:23.213 --> 22:25.044
Down there.

22:36.729 --> 22:39.892
Do you know the diagnostic criteria
for preeclampsia?

22:40.067 --> 22:44.231
Blood pressure greater than 1 40 over 90,
proteinuria and edema.

22:44.404 --> 22:48.034
-She had proteinuria.
-l attributed it to a urinary infection .

22:48.209 --> 22:52.043
-Her pressure was only high once.
-You should've checked again .

22:52.347 --> 22:55.078
My index of suspicion
should've been higher.

22:55.249 --> 22:58.980
l treated her seizure with
magnesium sulfate and Ativan .

22:59.154 --> 23:02.784
-What about the ultrasound?
-l missed the placental abruption .

23:02.958 --> 23:06.917
The AFl and profile were excellent.
There was normal fundal placement.

23:07.097 --> 23:09.691
-Yet she abrupted .
-There were no clinical signs.

23:09.866 --> 23:13.700
No vaginal bleeding, shock,
abdominal pain or fetal distress.

23:13.870 --> 23:16.066
What are the criteria
for vaginal delivery?

23:16.240 --> 23:19.539
Favorable fetal lie and a small baby
under 4,000 grams.

23:19.710 --> 23:22.111
The baby was 9 lbs, 3 ounces.
Macrosomic.

23:22.280 --> 23:26.307
l used the Leopold maneuver and
fundal height to estimate baby size.

23:26.485 --> 23:28.385
l was off.

23:30.255 --> 23:33.053
What were the risks
of using forceps?

23:33.226 --> 23:36.320
<i>-A 23 % risk of shoulder dystocia.
-Which happened .</i>

23:36.496 --> 23:38.624
What qualifies you
to manage high risk OB?

23:38.799 --> 23:42.098
We're not here to question
Dr. Greene's training .

23:42.269 --> 23:45.727
-Why a C-section in the ER?
-Baby was hypoxic and bradycardic.

23:45.906 --> 23:48.137
There was a risk of brain damage.

23:48.309 --> 23:51.039
-Have you done crash C-sections?
-l've scrubbed in .

23:51.312 --> 23:53.338
l give Dr. Greene credit
for crashing her.

23:53.748 --> 23:55.910
What would you have done differently?

23:56.085 --> 23:59.782
l should've taken her up
to OB myself. lmmediately.

23:59.955 --> 24:02.651
l've induced before,
delivered babies before.

24:02.825 --> 24:07.388
l assumed l could handle
the situation . l was wrong .

24:15.373 --> 24:16.840
Anyone else?

24:23.015 --> 24:25.040
Thank you, Dr. Greene.

24:30.622 --> 24:32.249
That wasn't too bad .

24:32.424 --> 24:36.486
l knew once you had a chance
to talk it through you'd feel fine.

24:36.663 --> 24:39.633
l'm supposed to feel
some sense of relief?

24:41.602 --> 24:43.536
l gotta get back to work.

24:44.538 --> 24:47.905
By the way,
that stomach flu this morning . . . .

24:48.075 --> 24:53.104
The next time you disagree with me
don't do it in front of the patient.

24:56.751 --> 24:58.879
Where are we going?

24:59.055 --> 25:01.250
Follow me.

25:04.760 --> 25:06.854
Hold that a second .

25:10.134 --> 25:13.570
-What do you think?
-lt's a little small for you .

25:13.738 --> 25:16.206
-Whose is it?
-Yours.

25:16.374 --> 25:18.035
-Mine?
-Doug . . . .

25:18.643 --> 25:22.773
-lt's the same as yours.
-Eighteen-speed grip twist-shifter.

25:22.947 --> 25:25.781
Hyper-sprocket drive
and stuff l know nothing about.

25:25.951 --> 25:29.785
Hey, come here.
You ride bike, you wear helmet.

25:29.955 --> 25:32.083
Where's your helmet?

25:33.360 --> 25:35.191
l know you mean well, but. . . .

25:35.363 --> 25:38.331
-Come on, Doug . Race you .
-You're on .

25:38.498 --> 25:41.491
You should've talked
to me about this.

25:41.669 --> 25:43.534
l'll be back.

25:49.076 --> 25:52.604
-Where's Anita Salazar?
-Eloped . Can't find her.

25:52.781 --> 25:56.808
-Want me to send Public Health out?
-lt's probably a fake address.

25:56.985 --> 26:00.422
Mark, we've got an MVA coming in .

26:04.461 --> 26:07.362
Rollover TC, thrown 20.
Heavy ETOH.

26:07.530 --> 26:11.399
Lac on right leg, no fracture.
He doesn't want to be touched .

26:11.569 --> 26:15.131
Calls himself Smiley. No l .D.

26:18.176 --> 26:21.772
-l'm in the wrong place.
-Get a portable down here.

26:21.948 --> 26:25.111
-Get CBC, Chem-7, blood alcohol .
-Watch his neck.

26:25.284 --> 26:28.481
Transfer, one, two, three. All right.

26:28.655 --> 26:30.986
-BP 90 over 50.
-Get him undressed .

26:31.157 --> 26:34.594
-Hit your head? Does it hurt?
-How should l know?

26:34.761 --> 26:37.390
-Run the saline wide open .
-Drunk as a skunk.

26:37.565 --> 26:40.159
Cap refill's slow.
He's hypovolemic.

26:40.335 --> 26:43.202
-Do you think it's the spleen?
-Don't know.

26:44.205 --> 26:49.234
Shoot a cross-table C-spine.
CBC, type and cross for four.

26:49.410 --> 26:52.107
Stay still, Mr. Smiley.

26:52.281 --> 26:54.112
-X-ray's ready.
-Lungs clear.

26:54.283 --> 26:56.718
-Shooting .
-Stand back.

26:57.988 --> 26:59.717
Hold your breath .

27:01.224 --> 27:02.885
Clear.

27:03.460 --> 27:04.723
O-2 is here.

27:04.894 --> 27:08.763
-Get your hands off me!
-Abdomen's rigid . lt's the spleen .

27:08.933 --> 27:10.924
Let's prep for a lavage.

27:11.102 --> 27:14.833
Smiley, we need to make sure
you're not bleeding internally.

27:15.007 --> 27:19.671
We're gonna take this tube and put it
in your nose and into your stomach .

27:19.845 --> 27:21.973
-lt's not pleasant.
-Go to hell !

27:22.148 --> 27:24.616
lt's not the highlight of my day either.

27:24.951 --> 27:26.543
Don't come near me with no tube.

27:26.719 --> 27:30.382
-One percent X ylocaine with epi .
-You're drunk out of your mind .

27:30.556 --> 27:35.426
We need to take care of you .
This is our decision, not yours.

27:37.264 --> 27:39.164
Just keep breathing .

27:45.874 --> 27:49.436
l assisted on a laparotomy
and closed the incision .

27:49.611 --> 27:52.843
Two new procedures.
Finally l have a chance.

27:54.317 --> 27:57.376
Can l get you anything, Haleh?
Coffee? Cake?

27:57.553 --> 28:00.079
-You wanna get me coffee?
-Sure.

28:00.257 --> 28:02.487
Cream and sugar.

28:03.961 --> 28:06.862
-Where are we putting Fareau?
-Exam 2.

28:07.030 --> 28:10.990
And if you could, here's a list
of procedures l still need .

28:11.169 --> 28:14.503
-lf any come in throw them my way?
-Sure.

28:15.174 --> 28:18.633
You can help Wendy get an lV going
on our junkie friend in Two.

28:18.811 --> 28:21.780
-lV is not on my list.
-lt is now.

28:30.891 --> 28:36.261
-Maybe we should get a doctor.
-l'll find a vein . l always do.

28:36.430 --> 28:38.261
There's one.

28:39.768 --> 28:41.395
No good .

28:41.570 --> 28:43.663
-l'll get Dr. Lewis.
-What for?

28:43.839 --> 28:47.435
He hasn't got a vein anywhere.
He's gonna need a central line.

28:52.616 --> 28:55.244
He's bleeding out.
We've gotta find the source.

28:55.419 --> 28:57.716
-How's that lavage?
-Almost there.

28:57.888 --> 29:02.349
Gotta find the bleeder.
lt could be retroperitoneal .

29:03.560 --> 29:05.460
He's feeling it. More lidocaine.

29:07.031 --> 29:10.000
-Where's he bleeding?
-No output yet.

29:11.302 --> 29:13.999
-Hang two units now.
-This is soaked through .

29:14.172 --> 29:17.267
-Will four units be enough?
-Get four more.

29:18.310 --> 29:19.937
Found it!

29:20.112 --> 29:21.875
-Femoral artery.
-lt's a pumper.

29:22.081 --> 29:26.348
Get Vascular on the line, get an
angiogram and let's get him up .

29:26.520 --> 29:28.613
-l'll keep pressuring .
-Call the Cath Lab.

29:28.789 --> 29:30.155
Let's move!

29:34.595 --> 29:36.359
Deb?

29:36.531 --> 29:40.798
Almost done. . . .

29:40.969 --> 29:42.368
There.

29:42.538 --> 29:47.134
Are you crazy? You're not allowed
to do a central line!

29:47.309 --> 29:49.277
lt seemed so easy.

29:49.445 --> 29:52.972
-You get in trouble, l'll get fired .
-lt's fine. Look.

29:53.149 --> 29:55.174
Oh, my God .

29:55.351 --> 29:57.785
-Where's the. . . .?
-What's wrong?

29:57.954 --> 30:00.856
-What's going on?
-Where's the guide wire?

30:01.025 --> 30:04.462
You lost the wire?
Deb, where is it?

30:05.430 --> 30:08.399
There it is. Cath lab, stat.

30:09.400 --> 30:11.392
What happened?
Deb, what happened?

30:11.570 --> 30:14.165
-l need a cath lab.
-Oh, my God .

30:14.339 --> 30:17.240
-Come on, Carter, move.
-We need to snare it.

30:17.410 --> 30:22.713
-Get a fluoroscope. Order an echo.
-Call Transport to take him up .

30:22.883 --> 30:24.975
Deb?

30:27.789 --> 30:29.813
Deb, wait a minute.

30:29.990 --> 30:31.322
Deb, wait!

30:41.203 --> 30:45.139
-You found Deb?
-There's no answer at her house.

30:45.308 --> 30:49.904
-l almost feel responsible.
-You didn't nearly kill a patient.

30:50.080 --> 30:53.243
-Carter. Where's Chen?
-l have no idea.

30:53.416 --> 30:55.441
Find her. Swift wants to talk to her.

30:55.619 --> 30:58.646
-How's the patient?
-Well, we got the wire out.

30:58.856 --> 31:02.292
Whether or not we'll be sued
is another story.

31:07.933 --> 31:10.528
-You shouldn't have bought Jake that bike.
-Why not?

31:10.702 --> 31:12.192
He has one.

31:12.372 --> 31:16.069
-He wanted it.
-He doesn't get everything he wants.

31:16.242 --> 31:18.506
-l'll take it back.
-You miss the point.

31:18.678 --> 31:23.013
-A 1 2-year-old hit by a delivery truck!
-l'll be right there.

31:23.851 --> 31:28.413
-l wanted to do something nice.
-lt's too much, too soon .

31:28.589 --> 31:31.149
-He doesn't know what it means.
-Neither do l .

31:31.325 --> 31:33.760
-You can't go through him to get to me.
-You think that?

31:33.929 --> 31:35.897
That's what he hopes you're doing .

31:36.064 --> 31:38.897
-Doug, Trauma 1 !
-1 2-year-old ran through red light.

31:39.067 --> 31:43.437
Hit and thrown 20 feet.
LOC at scene. BP 60 over 40.

31:43.606 --> 31:46.632
l think he's got left pneumo.
Name's Billy Schmoo.

31:48.278 --> 31:50.678
Jennifer left?

31:51.480 --> 31:53.608
l can't believe you didn't tell me.

31:53.784 --> 31:57.084
l wasn't gonna announce it
over the intercom.

31:57.254 --> 32:00.952
-What did you tell Rachel?
-l took the high road on that one.

32:01.125 --> 32:03.218
Nothing .

32:07.666 --> 32:10.635
l don't think l can bear losing her.

32:10.804 --> 32:14.240
-l hardly see her as it is.
-Yeah .

32:15.709 --> 32:20.578
Well, that's kind of the problem,
isn't it?

32:21.815 --> 32:25.411
With Jennifer. Not just Rachel .

32:25.585 --> 32:28.317

Sometimes it almost scares me.

40:14.809 --> 40:16.277

When l was a kid my older brother

he was awake.

42:26.490 --> 42:27.855
Chloe. . . .

42:29.661 --> 42:32.823
