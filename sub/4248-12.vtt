WEBVTT

00:30.947 --> 00:32.490
SARAH DEFINITELY
RECOGNISED VICTOR.

00:32.573 --> 00:33.700
IT WAS TERRIFYING.

00:33.783 --> 00:36.035
SHE WAS SO SCARED OF HIM.

00:36.119 --> 00:41.249
{\an5}SHE...
(whispers) SHE SAID
HE KILLED THEM.

00:41.332 --> 00:42.125
HER PARENTS?

00:42.208 --> 00:43.918
{\an1}WELL I THINK THAT'S WHO SHE
MEANT.

00:44.002 --> 00:45.837
{\an4}BECAUSE AFTER THAT SHE
STARTED SINGING THIS LULLABY
AND IT ALL GOT VERY WEIRD.

00:45.920 --> 00:49.799
IT'S JUST TOO CREEPY
TO EVEN THINK.

00:49.883 --> 00:52.343
{\an1}VICTOR ALIVE, WHEN SARAH
WAS A LITTLE GIRL.

00:52.427 --> 00:54.846
YEAH. LIKE IT'S NOT BAD
ENOUGH HE'S ALIVE NOW.

00:54.929 --> 00:57.432
{\an1}DID SHE MENTION ANYTHING
ABOUT THE ELIXIR?

00:57.515 --> 00:59.642
NOT REALLY.

00:59.726 --> 01:01.895
{\an1}JUST THE SAME THING ABOUT
TIPPING THE "SCALES OF LIFE"?

01:01.978 --> 01:03.354
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

01:03.438 --> 01:08.485
{\an1}WHAT COULD... BE MORE
DELICIOUS THAN THIS MUFFIN.

01:08.568 --> 01:11.154
SHOULDN'T YOU BE GETTING
TO SCHOOL?

01:15.325 --> 01:18.495
TELL MARA TO GET A MOVE ON.

01:26.795 --> 01:29.255
MARA - YOU AWAKE?

01:29.339 --> 01:32.175
NO.

01:32.258 --> 01:35.470
{\an4}YOU'VE MISSED BREAKFAST,
AND MICK'S WAITING FOR
YOU DOWNSTAIRS.

01:35.553 --> 01:37.514
I DON'T WANT ANY BREAKFAST.

01:37.597 --> 01:39.849
AND MICK CAN WAIT ALL DAY
FOR ALL I CARE.

01:39.933 --> 01:42.018
ARE YOU FEELING ILL?

01:42.101 --> 01:44.854
SICK. SICK OF MYSELF.

01:44.938 --> 01:45.563
WAIT A MINUTE.

01:45.647 --> 01:46.397
{\an1}WHERE HAS ALL THIS COME
FROM?

01:46.481 --> 01:48.608
I'M BORING!

01:48.691 --> 01:49.526
SAYS WHO?

01:49.609 --> 01:51.194
I AM AREN'T I?

01:51.277 --> 01:54.989
{\an1}NO, YOU'RE GREAT.
END OF STORY.

01:55.073 --> 01:58.993
{\an1}IS THIS ANYTHING TO DO
WITH MICK?

01:59.369 --> 02:01.496
{\an1}(Jerome) WINKLER SERIOUSLY NEEDS
TO GET A SENSE OF HUMOR.

02:01.579 --> 02:03.998
{\an1}I MEAN, WHERE IS THE REWARD
FOR ENTERPRISE IN THIS PLACE?

02:04.082 --> 02:09.086
{\an1}I KNOW, PROBABATION;
FOUR WEEKS OF BOREDOM.

02:09.169 --> 02:12.048
{\an1}NO PRANKS, NO SCAMS,
NO FUN!

02:12.131 --> 02:14.884
{\an1}AND WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO
DO? SCHOOL WORK?

02:14.968 --> 02:16.886
{\an3}I KNOW!

02:16.970 --> 02:18.805
WAIT A MINUTE.

02:18.888 --> 02:20.765
{\an1}DO I SEE A LIGHT BULB
ABOVE YOUR HEAD?

02:20.849 --> 02:23.351
INDEED YOU DO ALFIE,
INDEED YOU DO.

02:23.434 --> 02:25.478
WHOSE FAULT IS IT THAT
WE'RE IN THIS MESS?

02:25.562 --> 02:30.108
{\an1}YOURS. MINE? LETS JUST
SAY IT'S OURS.

02:30.191 --> 02:31.401
{\an1}WHAT'S THE POINT IN FIGHTING
WHAT'S DONE IS DONE.

02:31.484 --> 02:34.863
{\an1}NO, NO, NO ALFIE. IT'S NOT OUR
FAULT WE ARE IN THIS MESS.

02:34.946 --> 02:37.448
IT'S THE SEVENTH GRADERS DUH!

02:37.532 --> 02:40.410
AND THEY NEED TO BE
PUNISHED.

02:40.493 --> 02:41.411
IT'S TIME FOR RETURN OF
THE ZOMBIES.

02:41.494 --> 02:47.250
YEAH.

02:47.333 --> 02:49.878
{\an1}OKAY, SO I'VE READ EVERY
SINGLE LINE.

02:49.961 --> 02:55.174
{\an4}I'VE LOOKED FOR UNDERLINED
PASSAGES, SECRET CODES,
FALSE SPINE. NOTHING.

02:55.258 --> 02:56.092
{\an1}IT HASN'T GOT A CLASP
FOR A START.

02:56.175 --> 02:58.344
WASN'T THAT PART OF
THE CLUE?

02:58.428 --> 03:00.597
YEAH, AND THERE'S
THAT AS WELL.

03:00.680 --> 03:07.228
{\an4}IT WAS JUST THE ONLY PLACE
WHERE "YESTERDAY ALWAYS
FOLLOWS TOMORROW".

03:22.785 --> 03:25.371
WHOAH! DIDN'T YOU USED
TO BE MARA?

03:25.455 --> 03:29.000
I DID NOT SEE THAT COMING.

03:29.709 --> 03:32.170
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO PUT ALL
YOUR MAKE UP ON AT ONCE.

03:32.253 --> 03:38.009
{\an1}I WAS IN A RUT.
TIME FOR A CHANGE.

03:38.092 --> 03:39.802
MARA ARE YOU CHEWING GUM?

03:39.886 --> 03:44.474
{\an4}YOU OF ALL PEOPLE SHOULD
KNOW THAT CHEWING GUM IS NOT
ALLOWED IN CLASS.

03:44.557 --> 03:47.435
GET RID OF IT PLEASE.

03:47.518 --> 03:52.565
{\an1}RIGHT, COLLECTING HOMEWORK
ASSIGNMENTS PLEASE.

03:52.649 --> 03:57.612
MARA, MARA WHY DIDN'T YOU
SHOW THIS MORNING?

03:57.695 --> 03:58.947
I WAITED AND WAITED.

03:59.030 --> 03:59.822
MARA?

03:59.906 --> 04:01.324
HAVEN'T DONE IT.

04:01.407 --> 04:01.950
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?

04:02.033 --> 04:04.327
DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

04:04.410 --> 04:07.497
{\an1}I JUST LIKE, DON'T HAVE IT,
OR WHATEVER.

04:07.580 --> 04:08.790
MARA? ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

04:08.873 --> 04:10.541
YOU DON'T SEEM QUITE
YOURSELF.

04:10.625 --> 04:12.835
GOOD. SUCCESS.

04:12.919 --> 04:16.547
OKAY, SEE ME AT LUNCHTIME
PLEASE.

04:16.630 --> 04:20.635
DON'T ASK.

04:21.719 --> 04:24.973
{\an1}TUTANKHAMEN'S BURIAL CHAMBER
LIES JUST THROUGH THERE...

04:25.056 --> 04:27.850
{\an1}I WONDER WHAT ARTIFACTS WE
WILL DISCOVER WITHIN,

04:27.934 --> 04:31.604
(Winkler) THEY ENTER THE TOMB.

04:31.938 --> 04:33.022
(Jerome laughs)

04:33.106 --> 04:37.193
{\an1}GUYS? REMEMBER WHAT WE
SAID EVERYONE.

04:37.276 --> 04:39.362
CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM.

04:39.445 --> 04:43.282
SO, LET'S HEAR WHAT YOU LIKE
ABOUT THESE FIRST FEW SCENES.

04:43.366 --> 04:47.537
ROUGH SCENES. REALLY
INCREDIBLY ROUGH SCENES.

04:47.620 --> 04:48.913
WELL ACTUALLY,

04:48.997 --> 04:50.915
IT'S A VERY ACCURATE ACCOUNT OF
HOW HOWARD CARTER AND HIS TEAM

04:50.999 --> 04:53.418
{\an1}FIRST BROKE INTO TUTANKHAMEN'S
BURIAL CHAMBER.

04:53.501 --> 04:56.337
YEAH, BUT IT'S A BIT BORING.

04:56.421 --> 04:57.588
SORRY NEENS.

04:57.672 --> 05:01.801
SHOULDN'T SOMEONE KISS SOMEONE
OR KILL SOMEONE OR SOMETHING?

05:01.884 --> 05:04.053
OKAY, HOW CAN WE HELP NINA?

05:04.137 --> 05:08.641
IDEAS ANYONE? ANYONE?

05:08.725 --> 05:10.226
GIRLS IN BIKINIS.

05:10.310 --> 05:14.605
{\an4}RIGHT, I'M JUST GONNA PUT
THAT DOWN AS A GENERAL
WARDROBE NOTE.

05:14.689 --> 05:17.984
ALFIE, I THINK YOU SAID YOU
WANTED TO SEE MORE ACTION.

05:18.067 --> 05:19.777
{\an1}AND MORE OF THE STUFF
THAT SARAH TOLD US.

05:19.861 --> 05:20.695
ERR WHO'S SARAH?

05:20.778 --> 05:22.280
OH BASICALLY

05:22.363 --> 05:24.991
SHE'S A WOMAN WHO WORKS
PART TIME AT THE MUSEUM.

05:25.074 --> 05:27.660
YEAH. SARAH. FROM
THE MUSEUM.

05:27.744 --> 05:28.703
SHE'S A RESEARCH ASSISTANT.

05:28.786 --> 05:33.207
{\an1}AND A TOUR GUIDE. RED HAIR.
GEMINI, I THINK.

05:33.291 --> 05:36.085
{\an1}(Winkler) OKAY AND WHAT SORT OF
STUFF ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?

05:36.169 --> 05:40.006
{\an4}JUST THINGS LIKE PLAGUES OF
LOCUSTS AND STUFF LIKE
THAT.

05:40.089 --> 05:41.674
SOUNDS INTERESTING.

05:41.758 --> 05:44.802
{\an4}NINA, WHY DON'T YOU GO BACK
TO THE MUSEUM AND TALK TO
THIS SARAH WOMAN AGAIN?

05:44.886 --> 05:48.097
YEAH, SURE. SARAH.

05:48.181 --> 05:48.723
FROM THE MUSEUM.

05:48.806 --> 05:51.184
(Whispers) WHAT?

05:51.267 --> 05:54.020
AMBER, I DON'T KNOW WHAT
GOES ON INSIDE YOUR HEAD.

05:54.103 --> 05:56.064
WHAT DID I DO THIS TIME?!

05:56.147 --> 06:00.777
{\an5}I THOUGHT WE'D AGREED WE WERE
GOING TO USE SARAH'S STORY -
TO GET A REACTION FROM VICTOR.

06:00.860 --> 06:02.153
WE ARE.

06:02.236 --> 06:03.988
{\an1}BUT WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO
KNOW SHE'S STILL ALIVE

06:04.072 --> 06:05.990
{\an1}AND LIVING A MILE DOWN THE
ROAD FROM HERE.

06:06.074 --> 06:08.701
{\an1}ESPECIALLY PEOPLE WHO MIGHT
BE SUSPECTED MURDERERS.

06:08.785 --> 06:11.579
OH SORRY. I'LL DO BETTER.

06:11.662 --> 06:13.831
{\an1}IT'S OKAY AMBER AND YEAH,
YOU'RE KIND OF RIGHT

06:13.915 --> 06:15.750
{\an1}WE DO NEED MORE OF SARAH'S
STUFF IN THE PLAY.

06:15.833 --> 06:18.252
{\an1}WE JUST CAN'T BE
TOO OBVIOUS ABOUT IT.

06:18.336 --> 06:22.799
{\an4}I THINK WE HAVE MORE PRESSING
ISSUES TO SORT OUT THAN THE
SCHOOL PLAY?

06:22.882 --> 06:25.009
{\an1}THE RIDDLE! I HAVEN'T BEEN
TO THE LIBRARY YET.

06:25.093 --> 06:27.136
{\an1}I WAS THINKING MORE ABOUT
THE ELIXIR.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.639
{\an1}YEAH, I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT THAT, TOO.

06:29.722 --> 06:32.433
AND YET WE HAVE NO ANSWERS.

06:32.517 --> 06:35.520
MAYBE I'M GOING TO HAVE TO
START THINKING ALSO.

06:38.564 --> 06:40.483
{\an1}HEY COACH, WHEN ARE WE
STARTING? IN TEN?

06:40.566 --> 06:44.028
OR NEVER? IS NEVER
GOOD FOR YOU?

06:44.112 --> 06:46.614
HAVE I DONE SOMETHING WRONG?

06:46.697 --> 06:49.867
ACTUALLY. YES. IF
YOU MUST KNOW.

06:49.951 --> 06:51.661
SORRY?

06:51.744 --> 06:53.663
{\an4}I OVERHEARD YOU LAUGHING
ABOUT ME WITH TWEEDLE-DUMB
AND TWEEDLE-DUMBER.

06:53.746 --> 06:55.998
WHAT?

06:56.082 --> 06:58.084
{\an4}YOU TOLD JEROME AND ALFIE
THAT I'M WAY TOO SENSIBLE
AND SERIOUS?

06:58.167 --> 07:01.504
OH. THAT WAS JUST GUY TALK.

07:01.587 --> 07:04.757
{\an1}YOU LOVE TRAINING WITH ME.
YOU KISS ME.

07:04.841 --> 07:08.553
{\an1}THEN I'M SENSIBLE AND
BORING. I'M SICK OF IT.

07:08.636 --> 07:11.931
SO THAT'S WHY YOU'VE BEEN
ACTING ALL STRANGE TODAY.

07:12.014 --> 07:15.977
{\an5}I THOUGHT IT WAS TIME TO
STOP BEING SENSIBLE,
BORING, PREDICTABLE MARA.

07:16.060 --> 07:18.229
I LIKE THE OLD MARA.

07:18.312 --> 07:20.314
{\an4}BECAUSE SHE CAN SORT OUT
YOUR TRAINING PROGRAMME
FOR YOU.

07:20.398 --> 07:27.613
NO! I LIKE YOU A LOT MARA.

07:27.697 --> 07:32.410
{\an1}BUT NOT ENOUGH TO
GO OUT WITH?

07:43.129 --> 07:46.299
{\an1}TIME TO TERRORISE THE
LOWER SCHOOL DORM.

07:46.382 --> 07:47.884
CAN'T FIND MY ZOMBIE MASK.

07:47.967 --> 07:50.970
{\an1}THAT'S FINE, YOU'RE
FACE WILL DO.

07:51.053 --> 07:52.638
OH NO.

07:52.722 --> 07:53.431
WHAT?

07:53.514 --> 07:56.559
I THINK I LEFT IT IN THE
CELLAR...

07:58.978 --> 08:02.982
YOU'VE GOT TO STOP EATING
SO MANY PIES.

08:03.691 --> 08:05.610
OKAY.

08:07.195 --> 08:11.449
(Whistling)

08:11.532 --> 08:15.578
YOU BOY. WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

08:15.661 --> 08:19.665
{\an1}SIR, I WAS JUST GETTING
INTO CHARACTER.

08:19.749 --> 08:22.251
I'M A METHOD ACTOR.

08:22.335 --> 08:27.840
AND I CAME TO INVESTIGATE,
BECAUSE I HEARD A BANGING.

08:27.924 --> 08:35.847
{\an4}THE CELLAR IS OUT OF BOUNDS
AS WELL YOU KNOW. GET IN THE
HOUSE.

08:44.190 --> 08:48.527
(spooky dripping noise)

09:00.248 --> 09:07.880
{\an1}JEROME? JEROME? HEY MAN THIS
ISN'T FUNNY.

09:07.964 --> 09:10.800
OPEN THE WINDOW!

09:16.639 --> 09:22.645
(clock chimes ten o'clock)

09:25.147 --> 09:30.236
{\an1}IT'S TEN O'CLOCK. YOU
ALL KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS,

09:30.319 --> 09:40.079
{\an4}YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES
PRECISELY AND THEN I WANT TO
HEAR A PIN DROP.

09:40.162 --> 09:44.667
(ping as pin drops)

09:44.750 --> 09:50.464
YOU. BOY. BED. NOW.

10:01.225 --> 10:05.604
{\an1}(rattling of keys and the
door opening)

10:19.994 --> 10:23.539
{\an1}(People chanting) YO DEE-EN
EN EN ANKH.

10:23.622 --> 10:29.670
YO DEE-EN EN RA NEKHEKH.

11:09.668 --> 11:16.050
(Knock knock knock)

11:16.133 --> 11:18.469
(Whispers) FABIAN?

11:18.552 --> 11:19.428
FABIAN!

11:19.512 --> 11:20.262
HUH?

11:20.346 --> 11:21.806
{\an1}ALFIE'S TRAPPED IN THE
CELLAR DUDE.

11:21.889 --> 11:23.641
YOU'VE GOT TO HELP ME.

11:23.724 --> 11:26.519
{\an4}HA HA. JEROME.
GO AWAY.

11:26.602 --> 11:29.397
HE'S BEEN DOWN THERE
FOR HOURS.

11:29.480 --> 11:32.358
I'M NOT LYING. I SWEAR I'M NOT.

11:32.441 --> 11:34.610
{\an1}DUDE, COME ON. I'M
REALLY WORRIED.

11:34.693 --> 11:35.778
GIVE ME A SECOND,

11:35.861 --> 11:38.364
HURRY UP.

11:38.948 --> 11:44.703
(Whispering) ALFIE? ALFIE?

11:46.705 --> 11:49.208
{\an3}ALFIE?

11:49.291 --> 11:55.047
ALFIE? HE'S NOT HERE.

11:55.131 --> 11:56.799
IF YOU'RE MESSING
AROUND JEROME,

11:56.882 --> 11:57.133
{\an5}I SWEAR.

11:56.882 --> 11:57.133
I'M NOT DOING...

11:57.216 --> 11:58.551
(Loud gasp)

11:58.634 --> 11:59.135
WHAT WAS THAT?

11:59.218 --> 12:01.637
SSH.

12:04.890 --> 12:07.184
{\an5}IN THAT CUPBOARD.

12:04.890 --> 12:07.184
(Heavy breathing)

12:07.268 --> 12:09.478
OPEN THE CUPBOARD.

12:09.562 --> 12:12.314
NO YOU OPEN THE CUPBOARD.

12:12.398 --> 12:15.401
I'LL OPEN THE CUPBOARD.

12:17.069 --> 12:19.738
ALFIE!

12:19.822 --> 12:20.990
(Quietly) HELP ME.

12:21.073 --> 12:23.492
{\an1}TAKE IT EASY, ALFIE,
IT'S ME, JEROME.

12:23.576 --> 12:32.418
{\an1}OKAY, WE NEED TO GET HIM OUT
OF HERE. COME ON, COME ON.

12:32.501 --> 12:34.170
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT MATE.

13:58.212 --> 14:01.257

14:01.340 --> 14:04.677

14:33.497 --> 14:35.666
VICTOR STUFFING CATS?

14:35.749 --> 14:39.086

{\an1}CUT IT OUT MATE. YOU REALLY
NEED TO SNAP OUT OF THIS.

14:45.009 --> 14:46.218
IT'S TIME TO GO TO SCHOOL.

14:46.302 --> 14:48.721
HE WON'T WAKE UP IF YOU
TRY IT THAT WAY.

14:48.804 --> 14:50.889
{\an1}ALFIE, THERE ARE PANCAKES IN
THE KITCHEN.

14:54.393 --> 14:55.561

DUDE ARE YOU ALRIGHT?

15:22.379 --> 15:24.173

15:31.555 --> 15:34.183
DID YOU GIVE HIM THAT?

15:34.266 --> 15:36.268
{\an1}WHY WAS IT STILL IN YOUR
BAG?

15:36.352 --> 15:40.481
I'LL GO GET SOMEONE.

15:48.072 --> 15:49.114
WHAT ABOUT THIS THEN?

15:49.198 --> 15:54.328
HA HA HA. THAT'S PERFECT
FOR A GIRL'S DANCE CLASS.

15:54.411 --> 15:58.374
{\an1}TRUDY, QUICK. ALFIE'S
COLLAPSED.

16:02.294 --> 16:02.711
{\an1}I'M GOING TO GO IN THE
AMBULANCE WITH HIM.

16:02.795 --> 16:04.463
I'LL CALL HIS PARENTS.

16:04.546 --> 16:05.756
IS HE GOING TO BE OKAY?

16:05.839 --> 16:07.675
THEY THINK SO, SWEETIE.

16:07.758 --> 16:11.053
{\an1}BUT, THEY DID ASK IF HE'D
TAKEN ANYTHING?

16:11.136 --> 16:12.429
LIKE WHAT?

16:12.513 --> 16:15.599
{\an1}I DON'T KNOW. THEY JUST SAID
"SOMETHING."

16:15.683 --> 16:22.439
{\an1}HE... HE TOOK A SIP OF THIS
JUST BEFORE HE COLLAPSED.

16:22.523 --> 16:29.154
{\an1}OH! THAT DOESN'T SMELL TOO
GOOD. I'LL TAKE THAT WITH ME.

16:40.499 --> 16:50.175
{\an5}NO-ONE IS TO LEAVE THIS
HOUSE UNTIL I FIND OUT
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED.

16:51.176 --> 16:54.513
{\an4}HE MENTIONED SOMETHING LAST
NIGHT ABOUT NOT FEELING TOO
WELL.

16:54.596 --> 16:59.101
{\an5}IF HE DIES, I'LL NEVER GET
THE CHANCE TO TELL HIM HOW
MUCH HE MAKES ME LAUGH.

16:59.184 --> 17:03.063
I KNOW HE LIKES ME AND HE
SHOULD KNOW HOW I FEEL.

17:03.147 --> 17:06.108
I MEAN, WITHOUT DYING.

17:07.818 --> 17:09.944
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING OKAY.

17:10.028 --> 17:14.575
{\an4}NOW CAN I GO FOR A RUN? MY
HAMSTRINGS ARE TIGHTENING UP
AS WE SPEAK.

17:28.505 --> 17:34.178
{\an4}I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE
DRINKS BOTTLE CAME FROM OR
WHAT WAS IN IT.

17:34.261 --> 17:37.681
I'M NOT SAYING ANYTHING

ALFIE?

17:55.783 --> 18:02.080
{\an1}I DON'T KNOW. I HONESTLY
DON'T KNOW.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.963
{\an1}WHY DID YOU GIVE THEM THE
ELIXIR?

18:10.047 --> 18:10.506
NOW WE'VE LOST OUR PROOF.

18:10.589 --> 18:13.509

NO WAY.

18:26.146 --> 18:28.857
BUT IT'S ALREADY PUT OUR
FRIEND IN THE HOSPITAL.

18:28.941 --> 18:32.194

18:32.277 --> 18:37.199
{\an1}I'M JUST NOT SURE ABOUT ANY

18:37.282 --> 18:40.702
IT'S ALL TOO MUCH.

18:51.296 --> 18:56.176

19:19.449 --> 19:22.703
YOU WON'T SAY ANYTHING TO
VICTOR, BECAUSE IF YOU DO,

19:22.786 --> 19:26.915
{\an4}YOU'LL HAVE TO EXPLAIN WHAT YOU

IN THE FIRST PLACE.

19:26.999 --> 19:30.210
