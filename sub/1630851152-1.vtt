- What is the soul?

08:13.409 --> 08:15.244
(wind whipping)

08:15.244 --> 08:16.370
Is there a soul?

08:17.830 --> 08:19.290
(distorted laughing)

08:19.290 --> 08:21.042
What makes us us?

08:22.168 --> 08:27.006

09:45.543 --> 09:46.752
(window clatters open)

09:46.752 --> 09:47.795
I need a room.

09:50.923 --> 09:52.008
- [Hotel Clerk] Cash only.

09:54.010 --> 09:54.844
- Fine.

09:57.638 --> 09:58.723
- (smacking) You okay?

10:00.224 --> 10:01.434

10:22.580 --> 10:23.414
- Room 102.

10:24.290 --> 10:25.541
(key clanks)

10:25.541 --> 10:26.667
There's a mini bar,

10:26.667 --> 10:29.295
but no continental breakfast.

10:29.295 --> 10:31.422
(key clanks)

Okay, okay, okay.

11:34.443 --> 11:36.320
(heavy breathing) Okay.

11:36.320 --> 11:38.197
All right, think, think, think.

11:38.197 --> 11:39.031
Think.

11:39.031 --> 11:42.451
(heavy breathing) Take.

11:42.451 --> 11:43.327
All right.
(bottle clanks)

11:43.327 --> 11:44.704
Windows, windows.

we all go out together.

12:02.555 --> 12:04.098
(intense whirring)
(Nathan groans)

12:04.098 --> 12:05.141
- [Nathan] Okay, it's happening.

12:05.141 --> 12:06.100
I have to go.

12:06.100 --> 12:07.977

13:04.408 --> 13:07.244
(Nathan thuds)
(intense dramatic tones)

13:07.244 --> 13:09.789
- [TV Announcer] Come down
to the End Hotel & Casino,

13:09.789 --> 13:12.708
where the end is
just the beginning.

13:12.708 --> 13:16.921
(air whooshing)
(faint indistinct chattering)

13:16.921 --> 13:18.547
- Daddy?

13:18.547 --> 13:20.049
It's okay.

13:20.049 --> 13:24.053
(dramatic melancholic music)

13:24.053 --> 13:25.721
Hold me.

13:25.721 --> 13:28.390

13:46.158 --> 13:47.201
(painfully groans)

13:47.201 --> 13:48.244
(gun cocks)

13:48.244 --> 13:49.662
- [Nathan] Hands.

13:51.247 --> 13:52.081
Fuckin' hands.

13:52.081 --> 13:53.249
Get your hands

13:53.249 --> 13:54.375
above your head.
- No, I know, I know.

13:54.375 --> 13:56.460
Fingers interlocked,
facing away.

13:56.460 --> 13:57.294
I know.

13:58.420 --> 13:59.672
- Yeah, I'm sure
you know the drill,

13:59.672 --> 14:01.090
you piece of shit.
(chair thuds)

14:01.090 --> 14:02.424
(Nathan groans painfully)

14:02.424 --> 14:04.885
(gun clanks)

14:04.885 --> 14:08.264
So what's a big guy like
you doing dealing to kids?

14:09.515 --> 14:12.434
- [Agent 805] Is that
what they told you?

14:12.434 --> 14:14.770
- [Nathan] What's this, huh?

14:16.230 --> 14:17.439
(Nathan breathes heavily)

14:17.439 --> 14:18.858
This...

14:18.858 --> 14:19.775
Where'd you get this?

14:19.775 --> 14:21.151
- [Agent 805] Oh, you know.

14:21.151 --> 14:22.778
You know we have access to that.

14:22.778 --> 14:23.904
(gun clanks)
- Access?

14:23.904 --> 14:24.822
Who's "we"?

14:24.822 --> 14:26.115
- [Agent 805] We, Synapse!

14:26.115 --> 14:26.949
Agents!

14:26.949 --> 14:27.908
- [Nathan] Oh, agents?

14:27.908 --> 14:28.617
You're dealing with agents?

14:28.617 --> 14:29.451
What agents?

14:29.451 --> 14:30.286
- Are you kiddin' me?

14:31.453 --> 14:32.788
Rookie.

14:32.788 --> 14:35.040
(footsteps pattering)

14:35.040 --> 14:35.958
(door clatters open)

14:35.958 --> 14:36.792
- Oh, I see what you're doing.

14:36.792 --> 14:37.877
Trying to trip me up.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.044
Yeah, you're a

14:39.044 --> 14:39.795
sneaky motherfucker.
- No, no, no!

14:40.838 --> 14:42.631
You don't understand, man.

14:42.631 --> 14:45.175
Look, I was an
agent just like you.

14:45.175 --> 14:46.468
805.

14:46.468 --> 14:48.137
I found out the truth.

14:48.137 --> 14:50.347
I found out what
was really going on,

14:50.347 --> 14:51.307
and they burned me.

14:52.141 --> 14:53.225
You gotta let me go.

14:54.101 --> 14:55.019
- That's good, man.

14:55.019 --> 14:55.978
That's really fuckin' good.

14:55.978 --> 14:56.896
You practice that all day?

14:56.896 --> 14:58.063
That's a great fuckin' excuse!

14:58.063 --> 14:59.815
- It's not an excuse!

15:00.733 --> 15:01.567
Look, who you workin' with?

15:01.567 --> 15:02.401
What, 702?

15:04.653 --> 15:06.989
Or is Thomson runnin' this op?

15:06.989 --> 15:07.823
- How do you know Thomson?

15:07.823 --> 15:09.158
- Oh, I know Thomson.

15:09.158 --> 15:11.660
SES, suppress, enforce, supply.

15:11.660 --> 15:13.245
That's the motto, right?

15:13.245 --> 15:14.830
Right?
- Yeah!

15:14.830 --> 15:16.332
- Listen to me very carefully.

15:16.332 --> 15:17.458
And second, your man's about
to come through that door,

15:17.458 --> 15:19.001
and he's gonna take my memory,

15:19.001 --> 15:21.545
and then he's gonna kill me.

15:21.545 --> 15:22.546
You gotta let me go.

15:23.797 --> 15:24.882
- I can arrest you.

15:24.882 --> 15:26.008
I can take you in.
- No.

15:26.008 --> 15:27.468
There is no "in"!

15:27.468 --> 15:28.761
There's no "in"!

15:28.761 --> 15:29.845
Nothing's changed.

15:29.845 --> 15:31.388
The LSD, the
cocaine, the heroine,

15:31.388 --> 15:32.598
it's all the same shit!

15:33.682 --> 15:35.517
The American citizens
are lab rats.

15:35.517 --> 15:37.811
The government, they make it,

15:37.811 --> 15:38.687
they test us with it,

15:38.687 --> 15:39.855
they enslave us with it,

15:39.855 --> 15:41.565
and then they imprison
us for using it.

15:42.691 --> 15:43.776
We are blind.

15:45.861 --> 15:47.947
- Just give me-
- Look, I don't have a second!

15:47.947 --> 15:48.989
I don't have a second!
- Give me a minute!

15:48.989 --> 15:49.823
All right?

15:51.700 --> 15:53.369
- You could help me.

15:55.329 --> 15:57.039
- All right.

15:57.039 --> 15:58.790
Here's what we're gonna do.

15:58.790 --> 15:59.708
(bodies thud)
(intense dramatic music)

15:59.708 --> 16:01.168
(gunshots firing)

16:01.168 --> 16:04.380
(bullet casings clank)

16:05.214 --> 16:06.465
(Nathan groans)

16:06.465 --> 16:08.050
- [TV Announcer]
This is LKLA at 2.

16:08.050 --> 16:09.218
A string of deaths

16:09.218 --> 16:10.886
that investigators
believe to be connected

16:10.886 --> 16:12.638
to the rampant use of mems.

16:12.638 --> 16:14.974
We sat down with a
representative from Synapse

16:14.974 --> 16:18.519
for a comment on the spiking
deaths among its users.

16:18.519 --> 16:20.312
- We are asking for
additional funding

16:20.312 --> 16:21.814
for our Enforcement Division

16:21.814 --> 16:25.526
to pursue those who sell and
distribute mems illegally.

16:25.526 --> 16:28.946
Synapse manufactured
mems are safe,

16:28.946 --> 16:30.823
regulated, and protected.

16:30.823 --> 16:31.949
We provide the public

16:31.949 --> 16:33.951
a safe way of experiencing life

16:33.951 --> 16:35.202
through someone else's eyes.
(packets rustling)

16:35.202 --> 16:36.578
- [TV Announcer] Someone
else's eyes, perhaps,

16:36.578 --> 16:38.497
but emergency services
have been reporting

16:38.497 --> 16:40.749
increased cases of
psychological disorders,

16:40.749 --> 16:43.544
schizophrenia, and possible
unintentional memories

16:43.544 --> 16:46.755
being carried over
when transferring
with heavy mem users.

16:46.755 --> 16:49.341
A term on the street
known as swapping.

16:49.341 --> 16:52.219
- There's no evidence to
support the idea of swapping,

16:52.219 --> 16:53.804
but this is exactly why

16:53.804 --> 16:56.640
we are running an aggressive
advertising campaign

16:56.640 --> 16:58.100
to educate the public,
(tape ripping)

16:58.100 --> 16:59.601
so that they know the dangers

16:59.601 --> 17:00.978
of buying lo-fi tech
(Nathan wincing painfully)

17:00.978 --> 17:02.438
on the street.

17:02.438 --> 17:05.607
You don't know what could be
laced inside unauthorized mems.

17:05.607 --> 17:07.818
Not to mention, the
detrimental side effects

17:07.818 --> 17:10.112
of transferring
with street addicts.

17:10.112 --> 17:11.488
But what are we gonna do?

17:11.488 --> 17:13.741
Stop the public from
using our product?

17:15.117 --> 17:15.951
No.

17:16.952 --> 17:18.244
The only place to get mems

17:18.244 --> 17:20.414
is from a certified
Synapse distributor.

17:21.665 --> 17:22.875
- [TV Announcer] When
pressed on the idea

17:22.875 --> 17:24.501
that Synapse itself
may be connected

17:24.501 --> 17:25.919
- Thank you all.
- to the illegal street trade,

17:25.919 --> 17:27.212
the rep denied comment.

17:27.212 --> 17:29.089
This is LKLA at 2.

- Check mail.

17:36.722 --> 17:38.640
Password: Carter.

17:38.640 --> 17:40.350
- [Voicemail Prompt]
Accessing inbox.

17:40.350 --> 17:41.602
(electronic whirring continues)

17:41.602 --> 17:42.978
- Take the end.

17:44.146 --> 17:46.732
(scoffs) What does that mean?

17:46.732 --> 17:48.692
What the (stammers)
fuck happened?

17:48.692 --> 17:49.985
- [Voicemail Prompt]
You have a message.

17:49.985 --> 17:51.236
(electronic chiming)
- Boss, look man,

17:51.236 --> 17:52.738
I don't want you to
hear this from me,

17:52.738 --> 17:54.823
but I feel like if
I don't tell you,

17:54.823 --> 17:56.241
you're a fucking addict, bro.

17:56.241 --> 17:57.493
You need to lay off that shit,

17:57.493 --> 17:59.620
and if you don't do it
for me or for Aamina,

17:59.620 --> 18:01.288
do it for yourself, okay?

18:01.288 --> 18:02.998
(bullets clattering)
Don't fire me.

18:02.998 --> 18:04.666
Hey, Juanito, stop

Just keep reading.

18:13.842 --> 18:15.344
(electronic chiming continues)

18:15.344 --> 18:18.055
- [Voice Of Aamina] Hey,
I haven't heard from you,

18:18.055 --> 18:21.308
and I just got this feeling.

18:21.308 --> 18:24.853
Look, just please
tell me you're okay.

18:24.853 --> 18:26.522
I'm gonna head over with Freddy.

18:26.522 --> 18:28.023
Call me.

Frank, it's Freddy again.

18:31.276 --> 18:33.779
Look, I know you,
and, like, you,

18:33.779 --> 18:35.447
you like to do whatever the
fuck you wanna do, okay?

18:35.447 --> 18:37.282
And that's fine, but
it's been a month.

18:37.282 --> 18:38.575
And I haven't told Aamina about

18:38.575 --> 18:39.701
the supplier you've
been meeting with,

18:39.701 --> 18:41.370
but everyone is asking about it,

18:41.370 --> 18:43.038
and I can only lie for so long.

18:44.039 --> 18:45.707
Call me, you fucking asshole.

18:46.750 --> 18:48.001
I'm worried.
(Nathan mumbles)

18:48.001 --> 18:48.919
She won't say it,

18:48.919 --> 18:50.254
but Aamina's worried too.

18:50.254 --> 18:51.964
- (grunts) I'll call you.

18:51.964 --> 18:52.798
I'll call you.

18:52.798 --> 18:54.216

Asking about your supplier.

19:00.139 --> 19:01.390
Asking about Nathan Stafford.

You've been here two days,
you only pay for one.

19:31.753 --> 19:33.881
A bunch of guys looking
for you earlier.

19:33.881 --> 19:35.174
Cops, I think.

19:36.341 --> 19:38.302
Not the ones you
want to fuck with.

19:38.302 --> 19:41.346
Fortunately for you, I see big
wad of cash you pulled out.

19:41.346 --> 19:43.599
What do you say we go halfsies,

19:43.599 --> 19:45.684
and I forget I ever see you?

19:45.684 --> 19:46.560
- All right, here, here.

19:46.560 --> 19:47.477
There you go.

19:47.477 --> 19:48.270
These guys, where'd they go?

19:48.270 --> 19:49.646
- Listen, I'd tell you,

19:49.646 --> 19:51.231
but it's going to cost extra.
(money thuds)

19:51.231 --> 19:54.610
(intense dramatic music)

20:03.118 --> 20:04.077
Back up!

20:04.077 --> 20:04.912
- Hold.

20:04.912 --> 20:05.871
Don't shoot.

20:05.871 --> 20:07.122

20:07.122 --> 20:07.956

20:07.956 --> 20:08.874
Give me the money.

20:08.874 --> 20:09.625
Tell your friend to back up.

20:09.625 --> 20:10.584
Same for him.

20:10.584 --> 20:11.585
You, weapon on the floor.

Same for your buddy back there.

We're breaking through

26:02.143 --> 26:03.270

27:00.952 --> 27:02.037
Where two different memories-
(tires squealing)

27:02.037 --> 27:03.163
- [Agent 917] Two personalities,

27:03.163 --> 27:04.831
they cannibalize each other.

27:04.831 --> 27:05.874
- [Agent 702] Keep him engaged.

27:05.874 --> 27:07.334
You go right.

27:07.334 --> 27:08.877
I'll go left.

27:08.877 --> 27:11.212
- Whatever You're trying to
pin on me is not gonna work!

27:11.212 --> 27:12.839
- [Agent 917] Just turn
yourself in, Nathan.

27:12.839 --> 27:14.966
We're only trying to help.

27:14.966 --> 27:16.468

27:45.580 --> 27:46.915
Oh, jeez!

28:03.473 --> 28:04.933

28:04.933 --> 28:06.267
give you a trial, Nathan.
(car door slams shut)

28:06.267 --> 28:07.811
A trial's too good for you.
(Nathan groans)

28:07.811 --> 28:10.063
They're just gonna suck out
what they need and dump you.

28:11.648 --> 28:12.774

I'm okay.

28:42.387 --> 28:44.931

(Nathan groans)

28:44.931 --> 28:46.391
- [Agent 917]
Nathan's in custody.

28:46.391 --> 28:47.642

28:49.978 --> 28:51.438
(brick clanks)
(Nathan wincing painfully)

28:51.438 --> 28:54.274
Cuff, then search, jackass.
(Nathan groans)

28:54.274 --> 28:55.483
- [Agent 917] Told you,
we should've put a bullet

28:55.483 --> 28:57.235
in his ass when
this shit started!

28:57.235 --> 28:58.820
- [Agent 702] Well, we can't.

28:58.820 --> 29:00.155
Not yet.
(handcuffs clatter)

29:00.155 --> 29:01.489
Is that all right with you?

29:02.657 --> 29:05.076
- [Nathan] Oh, my god
(groans painfully).

29:05.076 --> 29:09.998
(hood thuds)
(Nathan cries out painfully)

29:12.584 --> 29:13.418
What?

29:14.502 --> 29:15.754
Come on.

29:15.754 --> 29:17.213
- What are you carrying
around this for, huh?

29:17.213 --> 29:18.590
- Man, I don't fuckin' know.

29:18.590 --> 29:19.716
- No?
- (breathes heavily) No.

29:19.716 --> 29:21.176
- [Agent 702] No?

29:21.176 --> 29:23.803
(fist thuds)
(Nathan groans)

29:23.803 --> 29:24.679
(Agent 702 grunts)
- Ow.

29:24.679 --> 29:26.389
(hood thuds)

29:26.389 --> 29:27.348
(Nathan groans painfully)

29:27.348 --> 29:28.767
- No?
- No.

29:28.767 --> 29:30.518
- Someone like you has a
reason for everything, Nathan.

29:30.518 --> 29:32.020
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

29:32.020 --> 29:33.563
Why are you carrying this?
- I don't know.

29:33.563 --> 29:36.691
I found it in my pocket
this morning when I woke up.

29:36.691 --> 29:38.026
I don't know.

29:38.026 --> 29:40.153
(Nathan breathes heavily)

29:40.153 --> 29:41.362
No, come on.

29:41.362 --> 29:42.530
(hood thuds)
(Nathan groans)

29:42.530 --> 29:44.032
- I would love
nothing more, Nathan.

29:44.032 --> 29:45.492
I really would.

29:45.492 --> 29:47.619
You're a real piece of shit.
(Nathan groans)

29:47.619 --> 29:50.163
Yeah, I know somewhere in there
is a memory of what you did.

29:50.163 --> 29:51.372
(Nathan grunts)

29:51.372 --> 29:52.373
Can't have you runnin'
around with that.

29:52.373 --> 29:53.625
- I didn't do anything.

29:53.625 --> 29:54.751
- Oh, but you did, Nathan.

29:54.751 --> 29:56.377
You did.

29:56.377 --> 29:58.379
(Aamina yells out and laughs)

29:58.379 --> 29:59.547
- [Agent 917] What was that?

29:59.547 --> 30:00.215
- As much as I'd love-
- Oh, my god!

30:00.215 --> 30:01.508
My car!

30:01.508 --> 30:02.300
- As much as I
- I'll take care of it, okay?

30:02.300 --> 30:03.218
- wanna see you bleed.

30:03.218 --> 30:04.177
- [Freddy] It's okay, baby.

30:04.177 --> 30:04.969
I'm gonna take care of this.

30:04.969 --> 30:06.221
Gentlemen, please?

30:06.221 --> 30:07.430
(Nathan grunts)
- There are powers

30:07.430 --> 30:08.598
that need you alive just
a little while longer.

30:08.598 --> 30:09.974
- What's going on, huh?
- But don't worry,

30:09.974 --> 30:11.226
it's just a little while.
(Nathan groans)

30:11.226 --> 30:12.143
- [Freddy] I don't know
what's going on here,

30:12.143 --> 30:13.645
a lover's quarrel or whatever.

30:13.645 --> 30:14.938
It's not my business.

30:14.938 --> 30:16.231
But that's our car.

30:16.231 --> 30:17.315
- You're dentin' my car!
- Please, don't do this-

30:17.315 --> 30:18.650
- You're dentin' my car!

30:18.650 --> 30:20.109
Are you gonna-
- Don't do this right now.

30:20.109 --> 30:21.736
Your orcito will take care-
- We're Synapse agents.

30:21.736 --> 30:22.821
- Oh, so you're gonna
pay for this then?

30:22.821 --> 30:24.280
- Sir, I think it's only fair

30:24.280 --> 30:26.032
that we are compensated
for the damages to the car.

30:26.032 --> 30:27.492
- Ma'am, you need to back up.

30:27.492 --> 30:28.493
- Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh,
don't tell me what to do.

30:28.493 --> 30:29.702
Boy, you tellin' me what to do?

30:29.702 --> 30:30.495
You're tellin' me what to do ?
- Back up.

30:30.495 --> 30:31.913
- Synapse agents!

30:31.913 --> 30:33.081
Where is your uniform?
- Ma'am, I said, "Back up".

30:33.081 --> 30:34.040
(gun clanks)

30:34.040 --> 30:35.416
- Don't fuckin' touch me.

30:35.416 --> 30:36.251
(gun cocks)

30:36.251 --> 30:39.838
(intense dramatic music)

30:39.838 --> 30:40.797
(gun cocks)

30:40.797 --> 30:41.923
Keep reachin' if you wanna die.

30:44.342 --> 30:46.094
Freddy, gun and keys.

30:47.637 --> 30:49.514
- [Freddy] Hey, (slaps)
hold that for me.

30:49.514 --> 30:53.726
(intense dramatic
music continues)

30:53.726 --> 30:55.270
- [Nathan] He's got a vial.

30:55.270 --> 30:59.482
(intense dramatic
music continues)

31:04.863 --> 31:06.739
(Nathan groans and thuds)

31:06.739 --> 31:07.824
- You okay?
- Yeah.

31:09.075 --> 31:10.451
Yeah, just give me a second.

31:12.954 --> 31:13.788
- [Freddy] Mama.

31:17.625 --> 31:21.713
(melancholic instrumental music)

31:22.839 --> 31:25.133
(dark dramatic music)
- You have no idea

31:25.133 --> 31:27.010
the pile of shit
you just stepped in.

31:27.969 --> 31:29.345
(Nathan breathes heavily)

31:29.345 --> 31:30.597
- Frank, where
did we first meet,

31:30.597 --> 31:31.806
and what did you ask me?

31:31.806 --> 31:33.433
- What?

31:33.433 --> 31:34.976
- [Aamina] Answer the question.

31:34.976 --> 31:36.102
- I don't...

31:36.102 --> 31:37.312
I don't know.

31:37.312 --> 31:39.022
- Freddy, keep your
gun on these two.

31:39.022 --> 31:42.275
(gun holster rustles)

31:44.319 --> 31:47.322
I need you to
answer the question.

31:47.322 --> 31:48.156
- [Agent 702] You're screwed.

31:48.156 --> 31:49.657
And in about 10 minutes,

31:49.657 --> 31:51.326
dozens of operatives are gonna
converge on this location

31:51.326 --> 31:52.493
with a kill order on you

31:52.493 --> 31:53.786
and your little bitch
buddy over here.

31:53.786 --> 31:55.955
- Can I just smack
the shit outta him?

31:58.499 --> 31:59.334
- Now, Frank.

32:00.376 --> 32:03.838
(gentle orchestral music)

32:12.513 --> 32:14.098
- The staircase?

32:14.098 --> 32:18.895
(gentle orchestral
music continues)

32:18.895 --> 32:20.271
- [Aamina] And what did you say?

32:22.690 --> 32:23.691
- [Frank] Excuse me.

32:28.029 --> 32:29.197
What's a guy like me

32:30.907 --> 32:31.741
gotta do to run away with-

32:31.741 --> 32:32.700
- A girl like you?

32:35.036 --> 32:40.041
(dark dramatic music)
(Nathan groans)

32:42.210 --> 32:43.044
- Turn around.

32:44.253 --> 32:46.673
Kneel down, hands
behind your head.

32:46.673 --> 32:47.507
Let's go.

32:48.466 --> 32:49.550
- Do it.

32:49.550 --> 32:53.554
(dark dramatic music continues)

32:54.597 --> 32:55.682
- Freddy, get the car.

32:58.601 --> 33:00.895
(footsteps descending)

33:00.895 --> 33:03.690
- Whatever you were
hoping to get, forget it.

33:03.690 --> 33:04.816
His mind's fucked.

33:05.900 --> 33:07.735
Complete bleed-over.
(engine revs)

33:07.735 --> 33:09.737
You have no idea who
this guy really is,

33:09.737 --> 33:11.239
(engine revs)
what he's capable of.

33:11.239 --> 33:12.740
(tires squealing)

33:12.740 --> 33:15.076
If you get in that car,
I can't protect you.

33:15.076 --> 33:18.621
(dark dramatic music)

33:18.621 --> 33:19.956
(car door slams shut)

33:19.956 --> 33:23.960
(dark dramatic music continues)

33:33.261 --> 33:34.220
(car door slams shut)

33:34.220 --> 33:38.099
(dark dramatic music continues)

33:40.059 --> 33:41.728
Isn't who you
thought he was, huh?

33:41.728 --> 33:45.648
(dark dramatic music continues)

33:45.648 --> 33:47.275
- Where's Frank?

33:47.275 --> 33:48.860
- Aamina, let's go.

33:50.194 --> 33:51.029
- Aamina?

33:52.155 --> 33:53.322
Big time dealer.

33:54.615 --> 33:56.451
Oh, you're fucked now, sweetie.

33:56.451 --> 33:57.618
- What did you do to him?

33:57.618 --> 33:58.828
- All that's left of Frank

33:58.828 --> 34:01.122
is bleedin' all over
your back seat there.

34:01.122 --> 34:02.248
- [Aamina] Where is he?

34:02.248 --> 34:03.416
- Why don't you ask him,

34:04.333 --> 34:05.460
that guy you got there?

34:06.753 --> 34:09.297
Oh, shooting a Synapse agent,

34:10.465 --> 34:12.132
well, that's one
way to get noticed.

34:13.342 --> 34:14.802
(gun clanks)
(gunshot firing)

34:14.802 --> 34:18.806
(bullet casing clangs)
(Agent 702 groans painfully)

34:18.806 --> 34:19.724
- Let's go!

34:19.724 --> 34:20.975
(Agent 702 continues groaning)

34:20.975 --> 34:22.351
- Next time, it'll
be in his head.

34:23.643 --> 34:26.313
(Agent 702 continues groaning)

34:26.313 --> 34:29.484
(dark dramatic music)

34:32.320 --> 34:33.571
(car door slams shut)

34:33.571 --> 34:38.159
(car engine revs)
(tires squealing)

34:39.284 --> 34:40.995
(Agent 702 groans)
(hand slaps)

34:40.995 --> 34:41.829
- Get off me!

34:42.830 --> 34:44.665
On comm.
(electronic beeping)

34:44.665 --> 34:47.126
(breathes heavily)
Nathan's been taken.

34:47.126 --> 34:48.960
New priority target, Aamina.

34:48.960 --> 34:49.795
Need back up.

34:49.795 --> 34:51.505
- This is better for us.

34:51.505 --> 34:54.050
We have satellite
surveillance on the vehicle.

34:54.050 --> 34:55.927
702, get mobile.

34:55.927 --> 34:57.345
We're going to wait
until they stop.

34:57.345 --> 34:59.180
They're gonna bring us
directly to the Hive.

34:59.180 --> 35:00.348
(Agent 702 groans painfully)
Law enforcement

35:00.348 --> 35:01.974
is en route to you.

35:01.974 --> 35:04.060
We cannot afford
to involve them.

35:04.060 --> 35:05.728
(electronic whirring)

35:05.728 --> 35:07.105
- [Agent 702] Go get the car.

35:08.397 --> 35:09.941
- This bullshit's gone too far.

35:09.941 --> 35:11.859
We should've just popped him
and dealt with what happens.

35:11.859 --> 35:12.860
- [Agent 702] Right.

35:12.860 --> 35:14.237
When they're all over us?

35:14.237 --> 35:16.030
You wanna take that risk?

35:16.030 --> 35:17.824
- You shouldn't have let
him go in the first place.

35:17.824 --> 35:18.699
- Go get the car.

35:22.870 --> 35:24.455
(Agent 702 groans painfully)

35:24.455 --> 35:27.625
(dark dramatic music)

35:30.378 --> 35:32.463
(car engine roars)

35:32.463 --> 35:33.881
- [Freddy] I don't think
they're following us.

35:33.881 --> 35:35.299
(tires squealing)
- A tail doesn't matter.

35:35.299 --> 35:36.884
Guaranteed they got eyes on us.

35:36.884 --> 35:39.470
- All right, we need to
get to The End Casino.

35:39.470 --> 35:40.638
(gun clatters)

35:40.638 --> 35:41.556
Whoa, whoa, Aamina,
what the hell?

35:41.556 --> 35:42.723
- Don't say my name.

35:42.723 --> 35:43.891
What happened to Frank?

35:43.891 --> 35:45.685
- Just put that thing
away, all right?

35:45.685 --> 35:46.519
- Who are you?

35:46.519 --> 35:47.937
- It's me, babe!

35:47.937 --> 35:49.480
- What's the last
thing you remember?

35:49.480 --> 35:50.314
- I don't know.

35:50.314 --> 35:51.149
It's a little foggy.

35:51.149 --> 35:52.066
I was at the club.

35:52.066 --> 35:52.900
You were there.
(horn honks)

35:52.900 --> 35:53.901
Just listen to me.

35:53.901 --> 35:55.153
(gun cocks)
- Guys, relax.

35:55.153 --> 35:56.821
- What the fuck
is wrong with you?

35:56.821 --> 35:58.656
- You tell me what
happened to him.

35:58.656 --> 35:59.907
You tell me what
happened to Frank,

35:59.907 --> 36:00.908
or I will kill you.

36:01.909 --> 36:02.743
(engine roars)

36:02.743 --> 36:04.412
- Stop it.

36:04.412 --> 36:06.205
Stop pointin' that
fuckin' gun at me.

36:07.415 --> 36:08.499
(gun clanks)
(uptempo dramatic music)

36:08.499 --> 36:10.585
(tires squealing)
- Shit!

36:10.585 --> 36:14.881
(engine rumbles)
(tires screeching)

36:14.881 --> 36:17.884
(gun clanks)

36:17.884 --> 36:19.886
(car door clatters open)
- Ah, fuck!

36:19.886 --> 36:21.220
- [Freddy] Frank?

36:21.220 --> 36:22.346
(car door slams shut)

36:22.346 --> 36:23.514
- Give me a second.
- Calm down.

36:23.514 --> 36:24.348
- [Nathan] Oh, my god.

36:24.348 --> 36:25.474
- Frank?
- What?

36:25.474 --> 36:27.435
(Nathan groans)

36:27.435 --> 36:28.519
Just give me a second.

36:30.271 --> 36:31.230
All right, Aamina,
start talking,

36:31.230 --> 36:32.607
because I don't understand.

36:32.607 --> 36:36.027
(breathes shakily) What?

36:39.030 --> 36:40.156
Oh, no.

36:40.156 --> 36:42.617
(eerie dramatic tones)
(Nathan gasps)

36:42.617 --> 36:43.451
Oh, no.

36:43.451 --> 36:44.285
No, guys.

36:44.285 --> 36:45.119
Oh, my god.

36:45.119 --> 36:46.787
- [Freddy] Frank.

36:46.787 --> 36:47.622
Calm down.

36:47.622 --> 36:48.539
Listen.

36:48.539 --> 36:49.790
We'll get you to the club.

36:49.790 --> 36:51.459
We get you to the Hive,
we can make this right.

36:51.459 --> 36:54.170
Aamina, what did you do?
- Oh, my god.

36:54.170 --> 36:55.504
Oh, my god.
- Frank.

36:55.504 --> 36:56.505
Frankie!
- Shut up.

36:56.505 --> 36:57.965
Shut the fuck up!

36:59.175 --> 37:00.468
Shut up.
- Hey.

37:00.468 --> 37:01.385
(Nathan breathes heavily)

37:01.385 --> 37:02.220
- [Nathan] Stop talking.

37:02.220 --> 37:03.137
Stop.

37:03.137 --> 37:04.889
Shut the fuck up!

37:04.889 --> 37:08.476
(Nathan groans and
breathes heavily)

37:08.476 --> 37:10.519
(intense dramatic music)
(electronic whirring)

37:10.519 --> 37:11.687
- Frank?

37:11.687 --> 37:12.521
Frankie?

37:13.731 --> 37:15.566
Listen, I know it's
you upstairs, buddy.

37:18.277 --> 37:19.153
Hey.

37:19.153 --> 37:20.279
(Nathan yells)
Easy!

37:20.279 --> 37:21.280
Easy!
(gun clanks)

37:21.280 --> 37:21.948
Frank, easy.
(gun clicks)

37:21.948 --> 37:23.115
Take it easy!

37:23.115 --> 37:24.158
- I want answers.
- We'll figure this out.

37:24.158 --> 37:25.868
- In my head, I am Frank,

37:25.868 --> 37:27.828
so somebody better tell me
what the fuck is going on!

37:27.828 --> 37:29.580
- We don't know.

37:29.580 --> 37:30.456
- You don't know?

37:32.667 --> 37:36.462
Okay, I've done Snippet
Mems, whole Vacays.

37:36.462 --> 37:38.005
Oh, god.

37:38.005 --> 37:39.840
Three-Sixties, okay, sure,
I've done them, all right?

37:40.675 --> 37:41.884
But a whole swap?

37:41.884 --> 37:43.261
That shit isn't even
supposed to be possible.

37:43.261 --> 37:44.512
- The government's been

37:44.512 --> 37:45.972
messing around with
full swaps for years,

37:45.972 --> 37:48.557
not just memories, but
personalities, everything.

37:48.557 --> 37:50.309
- Man, I was at the
club last night.

37:50.309 --> 37:51.143
You were there.

37:51.143 --> 37:52.353
We were drinking.

37:52.353 --> 37:53.604
We were havin' fun.
- You haven't...

37:53.604 --> 37:55.273
Frank, you haven't been
to the club in a month.

37:55.273 --> 37:58.776
(Nathan breathes heavily)

38:00.695 --> 38:03.698
- Okay, I know everybody
wants what's in here.

38:05.032 --> 38:06.492
So how 'bout this?

38:06.492 --> 38:07.326
- Frank, put the gun down.
- Back up.

38:07.326 --> 38:08.577
Back the fuck up!

38:08.577 --> 38:11.622
- Put the fucking gun down!
- Get back!

38:11.622 --> 38:12.957
I'll do it, I'll do it.

38:12.957 --> 38:14.125
- Fuck is it you're doing?
- I'll do it.

38:14.125 --> 38:14.792
I'll fuckin' do it right here.
- Easy.

38:14.792 --> 38:16.043
Take it easy!

38:16.043 --> 38:16.961
- I swear, back off!
- All right, okay!

38:16.961 --> 38:19.922
Put the fucking gun down!

38:19.922 --> 38:21.882
- Aamina, do you remember?

38:23.301 --> 38:25.970
Do you remember the last
time you saw me like this?

38:25.970 --> 38:27.054
Because I do.

38:29.223 --> 38:31.767
Aamina, babe, please.

38:31.767 --> 38:35.896
(Nathan breathes heavily)

38:35.896 --> 38:39.900
(gentle orchestral music)

38:39.900 --> 38:41.402
(gun cocks)

38:41.402 --> 38:43.237
Do you remember that noise?

38:43.237 --> 38:45.197
Do you remember?

38:45.197 --> 38:47.074
Are you gonna let
me do it this time?

38:48.326 --> 38:50.161
Because if you let me,

38:51.537 --> 38:53.748
if you let me, I'll do it.
- Yeah, I remember.

38:56.375 --> 38:57.460
I remember, all right?

38:57.460 --> 38:58.294
Just...

38:59.295 --> 39:00.129
I see you in there.

39:00.129 --> 39:01.047
Just put the gun down.

39:03.174 --> 39:06.177
- I'm not doing anything
until I get answers.

39:07.678 --> 39:08.763
Who were those guys?

39:08.763 --> 39:10.723
- Synapse agents.

39:10.723 --> 39:11.640
Memory goons.

39:11.640 --> 39:12.850
It's the government's pharmacy.

39:12.850 --> 39:14.268
It's their security.

39:14.268 --> 39:16.187
- What do they want with me?

39:16.187 --> 39:18.522
- All I know, is you were
gonna meet with our supplier.

39:18.522 --> 39:20.274
- Wait, is that whose body
I'm runnin' around in?

39:20.274 --> 39:22.109
- We don't know,
but we can find out.

39:22.985 --> 39:25.363
We hook you up at the Hive.

39:25.363 --> 39:26.614
- Oh, right, hook me up.

39:26.614 --> 39:28.074
Hook me up so I can fuck
up my head some more?

39:28.074 --> 39:29.575
No!

39:29.575 --> 39:31.160
- It doesn't matter whose
body he's running around in,

39:31.160 --> 39:31.994
that's Frank!

39:31.994 --> 39:33.079
It's Frank upstairs.

39:34.622 --> 39:36.290
Just tell me what you remember.

39:36.290 --> 39:39.502
- I remember (groans) some...

39:40.878 --> 39:41.879
A woman.

39:41.879 --> 39:44.215
I remember a woman and a kid.

39:44.215 --> 39:46.384
God, their faces are erased.

39:46.384 --> 39:48.260
They're just fragmented pieces,

39:48.260 --> 39:50.638
but I keep seeing them here now.

39:50.638 --> 39:53.557
- If it's fragmented pieces,
it's probably a recent memory.

39:54.725 --> 39:56.394
That's a symptom
of a bleed-over.

39:57.311 --> 39:58.687
- Oh, god, I think...

39:58.687 --> 39:59.939
I think they may be dead.

40:02.024 --> 40:03.776
Wait, okay, okay.

40:03.776 --> 40:05.319
When I woke up...

40:05.319 --> 40:08.447
When I woke up, I had this
in my pocket, this vial.

40:08.447 --> 40:10.783
It's got my writing on it, see?

40:10.783 --> 40:14.495
(suspenseful dramatic music)

40:16.497 --> 40:17.331
- His Reboot.

40:19.208 --> 40:20.668
- What is that?

40:20.668 --> 40:22.628
- Stimulates the deep
memory centers of the brain.

40:22.628 --> 40:24.046
It opens up your mind

40:24.046 --> 40:26.090
to recall the last memories
of the transfer body.

40:28.008 --> 40:29.510
Fuck did you get that, Frank?

40:32.847 --> 40:35.349
- Take it, the End
Casino, no, no.

40:35.349 --> 40:36.851
No, we're identifying your body

40:36.851 --> 40:37.685
at the the Hive.
- All right, no.

40:37.685 --> 40:39.103
No, no, no.

40:39.103 --> 40:40.521
We're going to the End
Casino, and I am taking that.

40:40.521 --> 40:42.731
- Experiments that were
done with this shit,

40:43.691 --> 40:45.234
it didn't go well.

40:45.234 --> 40:47.862
All Right, people ended up
institutionalized or worse.

40:49.321 --> 40:50.489
Come on, Frank,

40:50.489 --> 40:51.323
you're not gonna-
- Oh, oh,

40:51.323 --> 40:52.825
so now I'm Frank?

40:54.660 --> 40:57.204
We're going to the End
Casino, and I am taking that.

40:58.831 --> 41:00.833
You got two options, Aamina.

41:02.251 --> 41:03.377
Give it!

41:03.377 --> 41:07.047
(suspenseful dramatic music)

41:10.551 --> 41:12.386
(car door slams shut)

41:12.386 --> 41:17.016
(suspenseful dramatic
music continues)

41:23.647 --> 41:26.317
(electronic whirring)

41:26.317 --> 41:28.861
(agent thuds)
(bullet casing clanks)

41:28.861 --> 41:31.447
(Agent 801 coughs)

41:31.447 --> 41:32.781
- What'd you do?

41:33.699 --> 41:34.909
(gun clanks)

41:34.909 --> 41:36.202
(Agent 801 coughs)
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

41:36.202 --> 41:40.623
Hey.
(continues coughing)

41:40.623 --> 41:42.041
- You know-

41:42.041 --> 41:44.084
(Agent 801 coughs)
- What?

41:44.084 --> 41:47.129
(Agent 801 groans)

41:47.129 --> 41:49.882
- You know I'm
telling the truth.

41:51.550 --> 41:54.512
(dark somber music)

41:57.598 --> 42:00.935
(ominous dramatic music)

42:06.690 --> 42:07.942
- Why didn't you call me?

42:09.318 --> 42:10.152
- I came in here, man.

42:10.152 --> 42:10.986
He got the drop on me.

42:10.986 --> 42:12.404
He got my gun.

42:12.404 --> 42:13.405
- [Agent 702] No,
he got your gun

42:13.405 --> 42:14.448
after I came into the room.

42:14.448 --> 42:15.449
What'd he say to you?

42:19.828 --> 42:20.955
- What?

42:20.955 --> 42:22.289
He's dead!

42:22.289 --> 42:24.083
He's not saying anything!

42:24.083 --> 42:28.337
(ominous dramatic
music continues)

42:44.436 --> 42:45.729
- [Voice Of Thomson] 702,
this is out of control.

42:45.729 --> 42:47.273
You need a containment.

42:47.273 --> 42:48.482
- [Agent 702] That's
the last thing I need.

42:48.482 --> 42:49.567
I got it under control.

42:49.567 --> 42:51.026
- You think this is control?

42:51.026 --> 42:53.153
A bunch of dead
agents in a hotel?

42:53.153 --> 42:55.948
I am sending the containment
group into your area.

42:55.948 --> 42:58.492
This conversation is done.

42:58.492 --> 43:00.494
(car engine roars)

43:00.494 --> 43:01.328
(siren wails in the distance)

43:01.328 --> 43:04.248
(car engine roars)

43:08.168 --> 43:10.337
(tires crunching)

43:10.337 --> 43:13.048
(engine rumbles)

43:15.759 --> 43:20.764
(car doors slam shut)
(horn honks in the distance)

43:21.974 --> 43:24.727
(truck engine roars)

43:24.727 --> 43:29.148
(faint indistinct chattering)

43:29.148 --> 43:31.191
- [Nathan] Freddy, get the door.

43:31.191 --> 43:33.277
- You just assume I
know how to pick a lock?

43:33.277 --> 43:35.029
- No, because I know
you keep your pick case

43:35.029 --> 43:35.863
in your back pocket.

43:35.863 --> 43:36.697
Get it.

43:40.200 --> 43:42.745
(horn honks in the background)

43:42.745 --> 43:45.414
(lock clatters)

43:47.041 --> 43:49.710
(door clangs and thuds)
- We're in.

43:52.212 --> 43:54.340
(door clatters)

43:54.340 --> 43:59.136
(footsteps clomping)
(intense dramatic tones)

43:59.136 --> 44:01.972
(footsteps continue clomping)

44:01.972 --> 44:04.099
Homicide closed this
place down a week ago.

44:04.975 --> 44:06.393
Probably a maintenance worker.

44:09.438 --> 44:12.024
(footsteps clomping)

44:12.024 --> 44:14.068
(child eerily laughing)

44:14.068 --> 44:17.488
(intense dramatic music)

44:22.534 --> 44:24.370
- What are you seein'?

44:25.454 --> 44:27.247
- Who I really am.

44:27.247 --> 44:29.708
(gun clanks)

44:35.589 --> 44:38.759
(footsteps pattering)

44:39.968 --> 44:41.762
(door clatters open)

44:41.762 --> 44:45.265
(eerie suspenseful music)

44:58.904 --> 45:00.823
- [Disembodied Voice] Help Me!

45:00.823 --> 45:04.034
- Hey, Frank!
(footsteps clomping)

45:04.034 --> 45:05.869
Frank, where you goin'?

45:07.037 --> 45:08.956
(eerie suspenseful
music continues)

45:08.956 --> 45:10.624
- [Mrs. Stafford] Come on, Sam.

45:10.624 --> 45:14.837
(eerie suspenseful
music continues)

45:14.837 --> 45:18.757
(Nathan breathes heavily)

45:18.757 --> 45:20.008
- [Aamina] What are you seein'?

45:20.008 --> 45:24.388
(Nathan continues
breathing heavily)

45:25.347 --> 45:26.390
- A crime scene.

45:27.474 --> 45:30.644
(footsteps pattering)

45:44.867 --> 45:45.784
- What's in there?

45:48.746 --> 45:49.580
- Nothing good.

45:54.918 --> 45:56.587
- We don't need this.

45:56.587 --> 45:58.088
Those agents are
probably right behind us.

45:58.088 --> 45:58.922
We need to go.

46:01.300 --> 46:02.551
You wanna know what's in there,

46:02.551 --> 46:05.053
but you don't have to do this.

46:07.181 --> 46:08.098
We get you back,

46:09.516 --> 46:10.517
and we get you home.

46:11.685 --> 46:15.689
(eerie suspenseful
music continues)

46:17.149 --> 46:18.150
(smooching)

46:18.150 --> 46:20.819
(tape clatters)

46:22.154 --> 46:23.614
(door thuds open)
(Nathan grunts)

46:23.614 --> 46:24.740
(door clangs)

46:24.740 --> 46:28.243
(Nathan breathes heavily)

46:31.747 --> 46:34.875
(dark ominous music)

46:52.976 --> 46:55.020
- [Nathan] Freddy,
did I do this?

46:58.148 --> 46:58.982
- No.

46:59.983 --> 47:01.652
Frank would never do this.

47:01.652 --> 47:03.612
- Not Frank, this.

47:03.612 --> 47:07.449
(dark ominous music continues)

47:18.252 --> 47:20.087
- [Freddy] Aamina.

47:20.087 --> 47:20.921
Over here.

47:22.965 --> 47:26.927
(dark ominous music continues)

47:31.598 --> 47:35.185
(Nathan breathes shakily)

47:38.939 --> 47:39.773
- Frank.

47:42.943 --> 47:43.902
What happened here?

47:44.903 --> 47:46.113
Is this the woman you're seeing?

47:46.113 --> 47:47.656
- I don't know.

47:47.656 --> 47:49.032
It stopped.

47:49.032 --> 47:50.576
- What do you mean, it stopped?

47:53.203 --> 47:55.038
- I'm not seeing anything.

47:55.038 --> 47:55.956
I'm not hearing anything.

47:55.956 --> 47:57.249
It stopped.

47:57.249 --> 47:59.001
- A woman was killed in
there, a child in here,

47:59.001 --> 48:00.377
but I don't see a man.

48:00.377 --> 48:01.295
So where is Frank, Frank?
- I don't know.

48:01.295 --> 48:02.254
- No, what happened?

48:02.254 --> 48:03.422
What happened to him?

48:03.422 --> 48:04.423
What happened to you?
- I don't know.

48:04.423 --> 48:05.549
I don't know!
- Well, you have

48:05.549 --> 48:06.633
to remember!
- Just met me think!

48:06.633 --> 48:07.467
- [Freddy] Hey!

48:08.468 --> 48:09.970
Let's just take it easy, okay?

48:12.139 --> 48:13.307
- What are we doing?
- You're pushing him.

48:13.307 --> 48:14.266
We can't push him.

48:14.266 --> 48:15.475
We don't know who that is.

48:15.475 --> 48:17.644
And 20 minutes ago, you
had a gun to his head,

48:17.644 --> 48:18.478
and now you want-
- Don't talk to me

48:18.478 --> 48:19.646
about this, okay?

48:19.646 --> 48:20.564
I know what you read.

48:20.564 --> 48:21.315
I know what you've studied.

48:21.315 --> 48:22.774
- It's Frank,

48:22.774 --> 48:25.402
but he's sitting in somebody
else's body right now.

48:25.402 --> 48:27.195
We can't be sure
who that guy is.

48:27.195 --> 48:29.615
- [Aamina] Don't you think
I noticed 20 minutes ago

48:29.615 --> 48:30.991
I didn't think he was Frank?

48:30.991 --> 48:32.868
But now, I know, and
you have to trust me.

48:32.868 --> 48:33.994
I know.

48:33.994 --> 48:35.162
- Okay, all right.
- Okay?

48:35.162 --> 48:36.288
- But I'm worried
about the here and now,

48:36.288 --> 48:37.247
and you're pissin' this guy off,

48:37.247 --> 48:39.166
whoever the hell he is.

48:40.125 --> 48:42.085
We got agents coming any second.

48:42.085 --> 48:47.090
(melancholic orchestral music)
(intense whirring)

48:50.385 --> 48:52.512
There's two dead bodies here.

48:52.512 --> 48:54.348
(intense dramatic tones)

48:54.348 --> 48:55.474
(Aamina whispers indistinctly)

48:55.474 --> 48:57.517
(melancholic orchestral
music continues)

48:57.517 --> 49:00.854
- But you have no idea how
deep this shit goes, okay?

49:02.022 --> 49:04.066
(Aamina and Freddy
conversate indistinctly)

49:04.066 --> 49:05.692
(intense dramatic tones)
(electronic whirring)

49:05.692 --> 49:09.029
(suspenseful dramatic music)

49:09.029 --> 49:10.238
- [Freddy] (speaks
indistinctly) But I didn't ask

49:10.238 --> 49:12.074
for this situation, so
I'm trying to help you.

49:12.074 --> 49:13.283
Don't jump down my throat.

49:13.283 --> 49:14.868
- [Aamina] Don't play
the martyr, okay?

49:14.868 --> 49:16.745
(indistinct chattering)

49:16.745 --> 49:18.705
- [Freddy] Well and (stammers)
get dragged into this.

49:18.705 --> 49:23.710
(Aamina and Freddy
conversate indistinctly)

49:24.920 --> 49:26.421
- [Aamina] We don't
have time for this.

49:26.421 --> 49:27.381
- [Freddy] Who the hell's
on that bed right there.

49:27.381 --> 49:28.048
- No, I understand, okay?

49:28.048 --> 49:28.966
I understand.

49:28.966 --> 49:30.092
Believe me, I understand.

49:30.092 --> 49:34.304
(melancholic orchestral
music continues)

49:36.598 --> 49:37.724
- Daddy?

49:37.724 --> 49:41.436
(melancholic orchestral
music continues)

49:41.436 --> 49:42.270
- No.

49:44.815 --> 49:45.983
- Who are you?

49:49.236 --> 49:50.487
- I don't know.

49:53.031 --> 49:55.033
- [Sam] Is this the end?

49:56.868 --> 49:59.079
- Yes, the beginning of it.

50:00.163 --> 50:04.876
(melancholic orchestral
music continues)

50:18.640 --> 50:19.933
(liquid dripping)

50:19.933 --> 50:23.061
(intense whirring)
(liquid sloshing)

50:23.061 --> 50:24.396
(intense whirring continues)
- Frank, Frank!

50:24.396 --> 50:25.397
What are you doing?

50:25.397 --> 50:26.231
Open you eyes!

50:26.231 --> 50:27.232
Frank!
- Frank!

50:27.232 --> 50:28.442
- [Freddy] Frank!

50:28.442 --> 50:31.611
(intense dramatic music)
(electronic whirring)

50:32.946 --> 50:35.574
(wind whistling)
(gentle orchestral music)

50:38.326 --> 50:39.453
- [Agent 702] So we clear?

50:39.453 --> 50:40.620
- Yeah.

50:40.620 --> 50:41.913
- Give him the money,
give him the tech,

50:41.913 --> 50:43.248
but you need his
access, all right?

50:43.248 --> 50:44.958
Everyone he's been dealin' to.

50:44.958 --> 50:47.961
- I mean, it sounds like a
pretty sweet deal for him.

50:47.961 --> 50:49.713
- Here's your first mark.

50:49.713 --> 50:50.505
Frank McDavitt.

50:51.757 --> 50:52.591
(footsteps approaching)

50:52.591 --> 50:54.217
- Bang, bang.

50:54.217 --> 50:55.052
What's up, man?

50:55.052 --> 50:55.969
Frank.

50:55.969 --> 50:56.970
(hands slap)

50:56.970 --> 50:58.889
- You gonna give me access?

50:58.889 --> 50:59.806
- Yeah.

50:59.806 --> 51:00.891
You gonna pay me?

51:00.891 --> 51:03.268
- This is about more than money.

51:03.268 --> 51:04.686
- Money and mems, man.

51:04.686 --> 51:05.979
- Give him the Three-Sixties.

51:05.979 --> 51:07.522
If it takes, we can
start moving swaps,

51:07.522 --> 51:09.191
and get the big
money, all right?

51:10.650 --> 51:12.277
- You know, I don't want the
little snippets, all right?

51:12.277 --> 51:13.862
I want the whole
nine yards, man.

51:13.862 --> 51:14.863
I'm want the Three-Sixties,

51:14.863 --> 51:16.990
you know, the trips to Fiji.

51:16.990 --> 51:18.867
You know, lay on
me the good mems.

51:18.867 --> 51:19.868
(case cover clatters)

51:19.868 --> 51:20.994
- Somethin' like that?

51:23.205 --> 51:24.706
- Yeah, should work.

51:25.999 --> 51:26.833
- Access.

51:28.460 --> 51:29.336
- [Frank] Cool.

51:29.336 --> 51:30.921
(footsteps departing)

51:30.921 --> 51:34.341
(intense whirring)

51:34.341 --> 51:36.093
- I love you, Nathan.

51:37.969 --> 51:39.513
(intense whirring)

51:39.513 --> 51:43.016
- You know, I always wondered
if the baby can hear me,

51:43.016 --> 51:45.644
or us, you know,
like when I sing?

51:47.479 --> 51:48.814
I wonder if the baby likes it.

51:48.814 --> 51:50.107
- [Aamina] I like it.

51:51.441 --> 51:52.317
- Yeah?

51:52.317 --> 51:53.819
(Frank laughs)

51:53.819 --> 51:55.028
Well, that makes one of you.

51:55.028 --> 51:56.196
- [Aamina] You can tell.

51:56.196 --> 51:58.115
He sits really
still when you sing.

51:58.115 --> 51:59.032
- He, huh?

52:00.158 --> 52:02.619
(indistinct chattering)

52:02.619 --> 52:04.538
- [Nathan] Where the
hell have you been?

52:04.538 --> 52:07.457
- [Frank] Man, I haven't
been trying to avoid you.

52:07.457 --> 52:08.875
I'm sorry.

52:08.875 --> 52:10.085
- [Nathan] Dude, if
you're gonna be my runner,

52:10.085 --> 52:11.419
I need you to be-
- I'm gonna be a dad.

52:13.380 --> 52:15.382
So we're sure it's a he?

52:15.382 --> 52:16.216
- Yeah.

52:17.175 --> 52:18.051
Yeah, I am.

52:22.013 --> 52:23.014
- Babe.

52:23.014 --> 52:25.767
No fuckin' way!
(Aamina laughs)

52:25.767 --> 52:27.811
Are you shitting me?

52:27.811 --> 52:29.604
Oh, my god!

52:30.564 --> 52:31.398
It's a boy!

52:31.398 --> 52:32.732
What...

52:32.732 --> 52:33.942
When the fuck did you get-
- Babe, babe.

52:33.942 --> 52:35.110
- Oh, my god, I'm sorry.

52:35.110 --> 52:35.944
I'm sorry.

52:35.944 --> 52:36.778
Oh my...

52:36.778 --> 52:38.238
I just can't believe it.

52:38.238 --> 52:39.906
I'm gonna be a fuckin' dad.

52:41.533 --> 52:43.368
I mean, no sob story
here, or anything,

52:43.368 --> 52:45.912
but my dad was never around
when I was a kid, you know?

52:45.912 --> 52:49.791
So being a dad is not exactly

52:49.791 --> 52:51.626
likely to come so natural to me.

52:53.128 --> 52:53.962
- Yeah.

52:55.172 --> 52:56.506
There's nothin' to it.

52:56.506 --> 53:01.386
If it's any
constellation, I'm a dad.

53:03.138 --> 53:05.265
You know I really
appreciate this job, man.

53:06.099 --> 53:07.684
My family really needs money.

53:07.684 --> 53:08.518
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

53:08.518 --> 53:09.352
Hey!

53:09.352 --> 53:10.437
No.

53:10.437 --> 53:12.314
Where you goin' with that?

53:13.481 --> 53:15.108
Don't ever talk
about your family.

53:16.443 --> 53:17.777
What do you think is
gonna happen to you

53:17.777 --> 53:18.945
if you go out there

53:18.945 --> 53:21.740
and they find out you're
a family man, huh?

53:21.740 --> 53:23.491
What do you think
they're gonna do to you?

53:23.491 --> 53:26.244
They will cut your throat and
leave you in a ditch to die.

53:26.244 --> 53:29.915
(intense dramatic music)
(bottles clanking)

53:29.915 --> 53:31.291
- You need to provide
for your family,

53:31.291 --> 53:32.792
and I understand the stress,

53:32.792 --> 53:34.586
so if you're gonna be my
runner, I need you on point.

53:34.586 --> 53:35.921
So I can't have you like this.

53:35.921 --> 53:37.464
- Yeah, I-
- Why don't...

53:37.464 --> 53:38.673
Why don't you...

53:38.673 --> 53:40.884
Why don't you do
one of the Vacays?

53:42.761 --> 53:43.845
On the house.

53:43.845 --> 53:44.804
My present to you.

53:46.389 --> 53:47.933
- Serious?
- Yeah.

53:47.933 --> 53:50.393
- (scoffs) Man, I
deal that stuff, man.

53:50.393 --> 53:51.645
I don't do it, all right?

53:51.645 --> 53:53.146
I mean, have you ever taken one?

53:54.064 --> 53:55.565
- Yeah, I've done 'em.

53:55.565 --> 54:00.570
(electronic whirring)
(dark ominous music)

54:01.571 --> 54:03.490
- [Aamina] Frank.

54:03.490 --> 54:04.908
Baby, let's go.
- Ah!

54:04.908 --> 54:06.493
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

54:07.494 --> 54:11.164
(somber instrumental music)

54:12.791 --> 54:14.209
- We can't deal
this shit anymore.

54:14.209 --> 54:16.336
We got Internal Affairs sniffin'
around all over the place.

54:16.336 --> 54:18.171
It's too hot.

54:18.171 --> 54:19.339
My boy needs his dad.

54:19.339 --> 54:20.257
- We keep going.

54:20.257 --> 54:21.091
That's what we agreed to.

54:21.091 --> 54:21.925
- Watch it.

54:21.925 --> 54:23.009
- Or what?

54:23.009 --> 54:25.679
- Hey, fuck you!

54:25.679 --> 54:26.805
- He's right.
- What?

54:28.265 --> 54:29.933
- He's right, it's too hot.

54:29.933 --> 54:32.852
We do one more big deal,
one last big payday,

54:32.852 --> 54:35.021
tie up loose ends, we
all go out together.

54:35.021 --> 54:36.398
- It's fine.

54:36.398 --> 54:37.816
- You look like shit.

54:40.193 --> 54:42.404
- I got this under control.

54:42.404 --> 54:44.155
All right, I got this!

54:44.155 --> 54:45.532
- You got this?
- I got this.

54:45.532 --> 54:46.700
- You got this!

54:46.700 --> 54:48.201
Look at you.

54:48.201 --> 54:50.453
Look like a fuckin' Colombian
drug lord from fuckin' Miami.

54:50.453 --> 54:51.663
(Frank groans)

54:51.663 --> 54:53.999
- Tie up loose ends,
we all go out together.

54:53.999 --> 54:55.292
- Loose ends?

54:55.292 --> 54:57.544
- Our runners, we pop 'em.

54:57.544 --> 54:58.628
Can't have a bunch of mem heads

54:58.628 --> 54:59.921
runnin' around with our info.

54:59.921 --> 55:01.381
- You think I don't notice this?

55:01.381 --> 55:03.425
You're wearing the sunglasses,
hidin' your symptomology.

55:03.425 --> 55:04.884
Your temples look like shit.

55:04.884 --> 55:05.677
You got the shakes.

55:05.677 --> 55:06.720
You got the itches.

55:06.720 --> 55:07.929
Yeah, keep goin'.

55:07.929 --> 55:09.264
You'll end up with
fuckin' Alzheimer's.

55:09.264 --> 55:10.765
- You need to think
about your family,

55:10.765 --> 55:12.058
what's good for them.

55:12.058 --> 55:13.226
- What the fuck did
you just say to me?

55:13.226 --> 55:14.352
- You heard me.

55:14.352 --> 55:16.646
- Hey, I will fuckin' kill you

55:16.646 --> 55:17.939
you bring up my family again.

55:17.939 --> 55:19.274
You understand me?

55:19.274 --> 55:20.233
- Relax.

55:21.318 --> 55:23.028
917, relax.

55:23.028 --> 55:24.738
- [Agent 917] You sidin'
with this muthafucka now?

55:24.738 --> 55:27.282
(intense dramatic music)

55:27.282 --> 55:28.700
- [Nathan] Lay off the shit!

55:30.493 --> 55:31.703
- Hey, fuck you, Nathan!

55:34.331 --> 55:36.708
(electronic whirring)

55:36.708 --> 55:39.127
(intense dramatic
music continues)

55:39.127 --> 55:41.504
- Yeah, he's one of us.

55:41.504 --> 55:45.675
- So it's possible that he
might have been seen again.

55:46.926 --> 55:48.762
He thought he was right.

55:49.888 --> 55:51.514
Maybe, he's crazy.

55:53.016 --> 55:56.269
But this time, and
this time only,

55:56.269 --> 55:58.271
he would not be afraid.

56:00.607 --> 56:01.483
The end.

56:01.483 --> 56:02.442
(knocking at door)

56:02.442 --> 56:03.443
- [Frank] Yeah?

56:03.443 --> 56:04.569
Yeah.

56:04.569 --> 56:08.990
Come in, come in.

56:08.990 --> 56:10.283
- [Freddy] Frank!

56:10.283 --> 56:13.661
(gentle ethereal music)
- No, Frank!

56:13.661 --> 56:14.871
- You know I got hooked?

56:16.915 --> 56:19.626
Yeah, I don't blame
you or anything.

56:19.626 --> 56:22.170
You know, I mean, shit,
you told me to stop.

56:23.296 --> 56:25.006
You know, you wanted
me to get clean.

56:28.176 --> 56:30.970
I mean, how was I
supposed to know, right?

56:30.970 --> 56:32.555
I mean, that I would get hooked?

56:32.555 --> 56:33.556
(chuckles) Oh, shit.

56:35.975 --> 56:37.394
I just grabbed the keys, man.

56:38.770 --> 56:41.064
You know, she likes
to take a drive,

56:41.064 --> 56:42.816
and it calms down the baby.

56:42.816 --> 56:44.234
Beautiful baby boy.

56:45.527 --> 56:48.655
(dark ominous music)

56:50.031 --> 56:51.533
(Frank sniffs)

56:51.533 --> 56:54.869
You know, I'm gonna start a
family, Nathan (voice echoes).

56:54.869 --> 56:56.413
- [Nathan] Baby,
just listen to me.

56:56.413 --> 56:58.164
Grab Sam, get his stuff,

56:58.164 --> 56:59.207
meet me over at the End Casino.

56:59.207 --> 57:00.041
I'm gonna meet you there.

57:00.041 --> 57:02.627
Room 307, okay?

57:02.627 --> 57:05.213
- The code to crash
the Synapse system

57:05.213 --> 57:08.383
is 1-9 (electronic
whirring) 7-9, 0-7.

57:10.343 --> 57:12.178
(chimes clank)

57:12.178 --> 57:17.183
(dark ominous music)
(Nathan gasps)

57:17.892 --> 57:19.561
(Nathan softly sobs)

57:19.561 --> 57:21.938
(heavy breathing)

57:21.938 --> 57:25.191
(dark ominous music continues)

57:25.191 --> 57:26.025
Frank.

57:26.860 --> 57:27.694
Frank!
- Frank.

57:27.694 --> 57:28.528
Frank.

57:29.487 --> 57:30.864
Frank, Frank.

57:30.864 --> 57:32.115
Frank.
- Frank, Frank.

57:32.115 --> 57:32.949
Open your eyes.

57:32.949 --> 57:33.783
Open your eyes.

57:33.783 --> 57:34.576
Open your eyes.

57:34.576 --> 57:35.827
Frank, Frank!

57:35.827 --> 57:36.619
- [Nathan] Frank
killed my family.

57:36.619 --> 57:37.162
- [Aamina] Frank.

57:37.162 --> 57:37.912
Frank?

57:37.912 --> 57:39.330
Frank.

57:39.330 --> 57:40.373
Frank.

57:40.373 --> 57:43.042
(intense dramatic music)
- I saw it.

57:43.877 --> 57:46.296
(mumbles softly) All right.

57:46.296 --> 57:48.339
(Nathan breathes heavily)

57:48.339 --> 57:49.716
I saw the whole thing.

57:49.716 --> 57:52.302
The agent that's
chasing me, Nathan.

57:52.302 --> 57:53.553
Nathan had a family.

57:55.221 --> 57:56.848
Oh, my god, I think
I killed them.

57:56.848 --> 57:57.682
- That's impossible.

57:57.682 --> 57:59.100
You wouldn't do that.

57:59.100 --> 57:59.934
- Hang on.

57:59.934 --> 58:00.894
Hang on.

58:00.894 --> 58:01.811
How did he end up with your...

58:01.811 --> 58:04.397
No, no, this is all wrong.

58:04.397 --> 58:05.356
- All right.

58:05.356 --> 58:06.566
All right, All right.

58:06.566 --> 58:08.067
We just gotta get
you back to the Hive,

58:08.067 --> 58:09.277
because that Reboot you took
is starting to take effect,

58:09.277 --> 58:10.737
and your memory's
gonna destroy itself.

58:10.737 --> 58:11.696
- What?

58:11.696 --> 58:13.948
- Two memories can't co-exist.

58:13.948 --> 58:16.201
Now, we have to suppress
one or the other.

58:16.201 --> 58:17.118
- I don't understand

58:17.118 --> 58:18.244
what you're talkin' about.

58:18.244 --> 58:20.455
- You can't permanently
erase memory.

58:20.455 --> 58:21.748
That's what the
government found out.

58:21.748 --> 58:23.666
You can bury it, disrupt it,

58:23.666 --> 58:25.627
but it's still there,
just underneath.

58:25.627 --> 58:27.212
So that shit you took

58:27.212 --> 58:28.755
is resurrecting
whoever you were,

58:28.755 --> 58:30.924
whoever's body you're in.

58:30.924 --> 58:32.342
- Why don't we
just let 'em loose,

58:32.342 --> 58:34.010
and let 'em slug it
out, see who wins?

58:34.010 --> 58:35.094
- [Aamina] 'Cause nobody wins.

58:35.094 --> 58:36.012
You just get bleed-over.

58:36.012 --> 58:37.096
You won't know which way is up.

58:37.096 --> 58:38.598
It'll be like
accelerated Alzheimer's.

58:38.598 --> 58:39.599
- You'll die, Frank.

58:41.267 --> 58:43.019
- We can still fix this.
- All right.

58:43.019 --> 58:43.937
All right, all right.

58:43.937 --> 58:45.980
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

58:45.980 --> 58:48.233
There's something else.

58:48.233 --> 58:50.902
This memory to code.

58:50.902 --> 58:52.320
I have the code.

58:52.320 --> 58:53.863
I have the access code.

58:53.863 --> 58:56.032
I have the access code to
crash the Synapse system.

58:57.575 --> 58:58.493
- What is it?

58:58.493 --> 59:00.286
- It's not a memory I can see.

59:00.286 --> 59:01.538
It's a code.

59:01.538 --> 59:03.081
The memory's the code.

59:03.081 --> 59:04.624
I need access to crash it.

59:04.624 --> 59:05.708
I need access.

59:05.708 --> 59:07.043
- [Freddy] Access, we got.

59:07.043 --> 59:08.878
We just have to get you-
(Nathan groans)

59:08.878 --> 59:09.712
(Aamina gasps)
(Nathan thuds)

59:09.712 --> 59:10.547
Holy shit!

59:10.547 --> 59:11.673
No wonder they want you.

59:12.549 --> 59:13.758
This is a good thing.

59:13.758 --> 59:14.968
We just need to get
you to the Hive.

59:14.968 --> 59:15.635
- Bring 'em down.
- Get the vial.

59:15.635 --> 59:16.135
Get the vial.

59:17.720 --> 59:19.055
- All right, I'll grab the car,

59:19.055 --> 59:20.682
and-
(skin squelching)

59:20.682 --> 59:24.102
(intense dramatic music)

59:25.979 --> 59:28.398
(gun holster rustles)

59:28.398 --> 59:30.024
(gunshots firing)

59:30.024 --> 59:31.526
(bullets zinging)

59:31.526 --> 59:32.777
(bullet casing clanks)

59:32.777 --> 59:34.654
(intense dramatic
music continues)

59:34.654 --> 59:37.490
(gunshots firing)

59:39.158 --> 59:41.077
- Frank, can you shoot?

59:43.037 --> 59:44.914
(gunshots firing)

59:44.914 --> 59:46.249
(agent groans)
(glass shatters)

59:46.249 --> 59:49.002
(intense dramatic
music continues)

59:49.002 --> 59:51.838
(gunshots firing)

59:58.636 --> 1:00:01.389
(gunshot firing)
(bullet casing clanks)

1:00:01.389 --> 1:00:03.850
(gun clicks)

1:00:07.478 --> 1:00:09.772
(Freddy moans painfully)

1:00:09.772 --> 1:00:11.482
You stay with him, okay?

1:00:11.482 --> 1:00:12.400
We need to get to the car.

1:00:12.400 --> 1:00:14.068
I'm gonna go clear the hall.

1:00:14.068 --> 1:00:17.530
(intense dramatic music)

1:00:20.074 --> 1:00:23.077
(gun clanks)

1:00:23.077 --> 1:00:23.953
- You're gonna be

1:00:23.953 --> 1:00:25.121
all right, okay?
- Fuck.

1:00:25.121 --> 1:00:27.373
(Freddy moans painfully)
(gun cocks)

1:00:27.373 --> 1:00:29.042
He was a good man.

1:00:29.042 --> 1:00:30.043
- I'm almost out of ammo.

1:00:30.043 --> 1:00:31.502
- Listen to me.

1:00:31.502 --> 1:00:33.421
(breathes shakily) He was
a good man, Frank was.

1:00:35.048 --> 1:00:36.549
- [Nathan] What?

1:00:36.549 --> 1:00:37.675
- He wouldn't have done
that shit you said he did.

1:00:38.593 --> 1:00:39.802
He always took care of me.

1:00:39.802 --> 1:00:40.845
Every job, he gave
me half of it.

1:00:40.845 --> 1:00:42.138
He didn't have to do that.

1:00:43.598 --> 1:00:45.725
He did it for me, and took
care of me and my kids.

1:00:45.725 --> 1:00:46.893
- I don't remember that.

1:00:46.893 --> 1:00:47.852
(gun clip clanks)

1:00:47.852 --> 1:00:48.686
- You were gonna marry Aamina.

1:00:48.686 --> 1:00:49.937
You remember that?

1:00:49.937 --> 1:00:53.608
(intense dramatic
music continues)

1:00:55.360 --> 1:00:56.277
(door thuds open)

1:00:56.277 --> 1:00:58.237
(arms shuffling)

1:00:58.237 --> 1:00:59.697
(Aamina thuds)

1:00:59.697 --> 1:01:01.658
- [Nathan] Let's talk about
this shit later, okay?

1:01:01.658 --> 1:01:02.492
- [Freddy] I can't.

1:01:02.492 --> 1:01:03.409
- Yes, you can.

1:01:03.409 --> 1:01:04.410
Come on, get up.
- I can't.

1:01:04.410 --> 1:01:04.994
I can't!
- Get up!

1:01:04.994 --> 1:01:05.787
Come on.

1:01:05.787 --> 1:01:06.579
- I can't feel my legs.

1:01:07.747 --> 1:01:09.374
(footsteps pattering)
(Aamina thuds)

1:01:09.374 --> 1:01:11.125
(hits thudding)

1:01:11.125 --> 1:01:15.296
Frank, (breathes shakily)
whoever the fuck you are,

1:01:15.296 --> 1:01:16.422
take care of my kids.

1:01:19.884 --> 1:01:20.927
Please.

1:01:20.927 --> 1:01:24.931
(intense dramatic music)
- All right.

1:01:24.931 --> 1:01:25.932
Yeah.

1:01:25.932 --> 1:01:26.933
(hits thudding)
(Aamina groans)

1:01:26.933 --> 1:01:30.728
(both grunting and groaning)

1:01:32.814 --> 1:01:34.273
(gun clicks)

1:01:34.273 --> 1:01:37.777
(suspenseful dramatic music)

1:01:37.777 --> 1:01:38.903
- [Freddy] Thanks, man.

1:01:38.903 --> 1:01:43.157
(suspenseful dramatic
music swells)

1:01:44.867 --> 1:01:47.954
(uptempo dark music)

1:01:49.205 --> 1:01:51.624
(both grunting and groaning)

1:01:51.624 --> 1:01:52.834
(skin squelching)
(agent groans)

1:01:52.834 --> 1:01:54.794
(bones crunching)
(agent thuds)

1:01:54.794 --> 1:01:58.005
(uptempo dark music continues)

1:01:58.005 --> 1:02:00.800
(Aamina breathes heavily)

1:02:00.800 --> 1:02:03.302
(agent thuds)

1:02:04.887 --> 1:02:06.639
(footsteps clomp)

1:02:06.639 --> 1:02:09.809
(Aamina continues
breathing heavily)

1:02:09.809 --> 1:02:13.104
(uptempo dark music continues)

1:02:13.104 --> 1:02:14.522
- Where's Freddy?

1:02:16.149 --> 1:02:16.983
(feet shuffling)

1:02:16.983 --> 1:02:19.193
- Aamina, Aamina!

1:02:19.193 --> 1:02:20.236
He's gone.

1:02:20.236 --> 1:02:24.157
(uptempo dark music continues)

1:02:28.828 --> 1:02:32.623
(door clatters open
and slams shut)

1:02:32.623 --> 1:02:33.541
(footsteps pattering)

1:02:33.541 --> 1:02:34.333
(uptempo dark music continues)

1:02:34.333 --> 1:02:35.293
(intense whooshing)

1:02:35.293 --> 1:02:37.628
(Nathan yells out painfully)

1:02:37.628 --> 1:02:39.714
- [Aamina] Hey, hey!

1:02:39.714 --> 1:02:40.548
Stay with me.

1:02:40.548 --> 1:02:41.507
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1:02:41.507 --> 1:02:43.134
All right.
- All right.

1:02:43.134 --> 1:02:48.139
- Come on.
(Nathan moans)

1:02:52.894 --> 1:02:53.728
Okay.

1:02:55.229 --> 1:02:57.982
(Nathan groans)

1:02:57.982 --> 1:03:01.152
(gunshots firing)

1:03:01.152 --> 1:03:04.572
(agent groans and thuds)
(bullet casing clanks)

1:03:04.572 --> 1:03:07.575
(footsteps clomping)

1:03:09.744 --> 1:03:12.121
(gun clip clicks)
- 808, 702,

1:03:12.121 --> 1:03:13.164
(elevator dings)
I'm coming to the stairwell.

1:03:13.164 --> 1:03:15.082
Emerge from the front.

1:03:15.082 --> 1:03:18.419
(Freddy groans)
(suspenseful dramatic music)

1:03:18.419 --> 1:03:19.962
(gunshots firing)

1:03:19.962 --> 1:03:21.714
(skin squelching)
(agent groans and thuds)

1:03:21.714 --> 1:03:22.882
- Yeah.
(gun clip clanks)

1:03:22.882 --> 1:03:27.386
(suspenseful dramatic
music continues)

1:03:28.554 --> 1:03:29.639
- [Agent 702] Drop it!

1:03:31.516 --> 1:03:32.892
(gun clip clicks)
(gun clanks)

1:03:32.892 --> 1:03:35.812
(suspenseful dramatic
music continues)

1:03:35.812 --> 1:03:40.149
(door clatters open)
(Nathan groans)

1:03:40.149 --> 1:03:42.902
(door slams shut)

1:03:42.902 --> 1:03:44.278
- 702, we are done.
(engine turns over)

1:03:44.278 --> 1:03:46.572
Law enforcement is
converging on the area.

1:03:46.572 --> 1:03:48.032
The op is blown,
- Come on!

1:03:48.032 --> 1:03:49.575
- [Thomson] and management
is shutting this down.

1:03:49.575 --> 1:03:51.035
- Management?
(pats pockets)

1:03:51.035 --> 1:03:53.204
Ma'am, all due respect,
(Freddy groans)

1:03:53.204 --> 1:03:54.622
you may be calling the play,

1:03:54.622 --> 1:03:56.457
but I don't answer to you.

1:03:56.457 --> 1:03:57.959
(Freddy yells out painfully)

1:03:57.959 --> 1:03:59.085
Where's the Hive?

1:04:00.169 --> 1:04:01.420
(Freddy laughs)

1:04:01.420 --> 1:04:03.214
- You want me to tell
you where the Hive is?

1:04:03.214 --> 1:04:04.757
(Freddy laughs)

1:04:04.757 --> 1:04:06.092
- I want you to listen to
me really closely, okay?

1:04:06.092 --> 1:04:07.635
I will suck it out of
your head, patch you up,

1:04:07.635 --> 1:04:08.594
and leave your
drooling in a chair

1:04:08.594 --> 1:04:09.428
for the rest of your life.

1:04:09.428 --> 1:04:11.097
You understand that?

1:04:13.099 --> 1:04:15.101
(footsteps clomping)
- Is your comm off?

1:04:15.101 --> 1:04:16.269
Agent 214 is down.

1:04:16.269 --> 1:04:18.187
Five said a vehicle
heading south.

1:04:18.187 --> 1:04:19.438
We got a tracer on it,

1:04:19.438 --> 1:04:20.940
but base is calling me out.

1:04:20.940 --> 1:04:24.110
- [Thomson] 702, dispose of
him, and get out of there now.

1:04:24.110 --> 1:04:26.320
- I'll take his contacts,
then I'll call it.

1:04:27.947 --> 1:04:28.906
Hook him up.

1:04:28.906 --> 1:04:31.951
(dark ominous music)

1:04:32.869 --> 1:04:33.744
Hook him up?
(claps hands)

1:04:33.744 --> 1:04:34.871
What's wrong with you?

1:04:34.871 --> 1:04:36.956
(knife thuds)
(Agent 702 yells out)

1:04:36.956 --> 1:04:38.124
(dark ominous music swells)

1:04:38.124 --> 1:04:39.083
(Freddy yells)
(gunshot firing)

1:04:39.083 --> 1:04:40.001
Ah!
(bullet casing clanks)

1:04:40.001 --> 1:04:43.296
(Agent 702 groans loudly)

1:04:43.296 --> 1:04:44.881
What the fuck?

1:04:47.633 --> 1:04:48.759
Ha!

1:04:48.759 --> 1:04:49.594
All right.

1:04:49.594 --> 1:04:51.137
All right, let's go.

1:04:51.137 --> 1:04:52.346
What, you said south?

1:04:52.346 --> 1:04:53.973
- Yeah, but that doesn't matter.

1:04:53.973 --> 1:04:55.057
It's done.

1:04:55.057 --> 1:04:56.809
- Give me the tracer.

1:04:56.809 --> 1:04:58.144
- [Agent 801] Thomson
is calling it.

1:04:58.144 --> 1:04:59.812
Leave it to the cleanup.

1:04:59.812 --> 1:05:00.813
- I don't work for Thomson.

1:05:00.813 --> 1:05:02.315
Give me the fucking tracer!

1:05:02.315 --> 1:05:04.233
- [Thomson] 702, I repeat,

1:05:04.233 --> 1:05:06.861
shut this op down now!

1:05:06.861 --> 1:05:08.487
- It's not over.

1:05:08.487 --> 1:05:10.323
We've got four dead agents,
and their killer on the loose.

1:05:10.323 --> 1:05:12.033
I am so fucking far
from being done.

1:05:12.033 --> 1:05:13.492
- 702!
(gun holster rustles)

1:05:13.492 --> 1:05:16.329
Your gun, slowly.

1:05:16.329 --> 1:05:19.957
- [Thomson] 801, go ahead
and take 702 into custody.

1:05:19.957 --> 1:05:21.334
(gun cocks)
- Say the word.

1:05:25.671 --> 1:05:27.798
- Nah, no, no, he's a fighter.

1:05:27.798 --> 1:05:29.008
Yeah, a soldier like us.

1:05:30.384 --> 1:05:31.886
You're just scared, that's all.

1:05:31.886 --> 1:05:33.387
- Just following orders, 702.

1:05:33.387 --> 1:05:37.558
- I'm gonna give you one chance
to save your life, just one,

1:05:37.558 --> 1:05:39.018
and then you will die.

1:05:39.018 --> 1:05:40.853
Thomson runs the battle.

1:05:40.853 --> 1:05:42.521
My boss runs the war.

1:05:44.690 --> 1:05:46.609
I can assure you
a full transfer.

1:05:49.111 --> 1:05:50.905
Yeah, put the gun down.

1:05:52.531 --> 1:05:54.033
- A full transfer?

1:05:55.284 --> 1:05:56.118
- Right.

1:05:59.830 --> 1:06:01.999
(electronic whirring)

1:06:01.999 --> 1:06:03.125
- [Thomson] 702.

1:06:03.125 --> 1:06:04.377
(electronic whirring
intensifies)

1:06:04.377 --> 1:06:07.046
- All right, from here
on out, we are off comm.

1:06:07.046 --> 1:06:08.673
Anyone resists, they die.

1:06:08.673 --> 1:06:10.841
(suspenseful dramatic music)
(Nathan yells painfully)

1:06:10.841 --> 1:06:12.051
- Fuck (groans).

1:06:12.051 --> 1:06:13.219
My head.

1:06:13.219 --> 1:06:14.095
(Nathan yells painfully)
(tires squealing)

1:06:14.095 --> 1:06:15.054
(engine roars)
Hurry.

1:06:15.054 --> 1:06:16.222
- [Aamina] Come on, baby.

1:06:16.222 --> 1:06:17.056
We're almost there.
(Nathan groans)

1:06:17.056 --> 1:06:18.557
- My name is Frank.

1:06:18.557 --> 1:06:19.892
(interposing voices)

1:06:19.892 --> 1:06:22.770
(intense whirring)
(electronic buzzing)

1:06:22.770 --> 1:06:25.147
(indistinct voices echoing)

1:06:25.147 --> 1:06:26.732
(intense whirring)

1:06:26.732 --> 1:06:27.984
- Oh, my god.

1:06:27.984 --> 1:06:29.568
we need a name.
- Francis Junior.

1:06:29.568 --> 1:06:31.570
- Yeah, Francis Junior.
- Yeah (laughs).

1:06:31.570 --> 1:06:33.489
- Oh, my god.

1:06:33.489 --> 1:06:34.281
Carter.

1:06:35.324 --> 1:06:36.325
My mom was...

1:06:37.785 --> 1:06:40.246
My mom was gonna call
me Carter (chuckles).

1:06:40.246 --> 1:06:41.914
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I like that name.

1:06:41.914 --> 1:06:44.125
(gentle orchestral music)

1:06:44.125 --> 1:06:46.252
- [Sam] Daddy, I wanna be
an agent just like you.

1:06:46.252 --> 1:06:47.920
- My name is Frank.

1:06:49.422 --> 1:06:50.631
(groans) No.

1:06:50.631 --> 1:06:53.676
(continues groaning)
My name is Nathan.

1:06:53.676 --> 1:06:54.969
I'm a Synapse agent.

1:06:55.803 --> 1:06:57.471
- To being dads.

1:06:57.471 --> 1:06:59.807
- To being dads.
- To being dads.

1:06:59.807 --> 1:07:00.933
Hey, fuck you, Frank!

1:07:02.059 --> 1:07:05.271
(electronic whooshing)
(knocking at door)

1:07:05.271 --> 1:07:06.230
And that morning, dude,

1:07:06.230 --> 1:07:08.441
I was just fuckin' tripping out.

1:07:08.441 --> 1:07:11.736
I mean, fucking tripping out,

1:07:11.736 --> 1:07:15.948
and it just, it
wouldn't go away.

1:07:15.948 --> 1:07:19.285
(somber dramatic music)

1:07:23.330 --> 1:07:25.666
(horn honks)
(tires squealing)

1:07:25.666 --> 1:07:29.795
(somber dramatic
music continues)

1:07:29.795 --> 1:07:31.255
(intercom dinging)

1:07:31.255 --> 1:07:32.465
- [Intercom] Dean
to ICU, please.

1:07:32.465 --> 1:07:34.300
Dr. Dean to ICU.

1:07:34.300 --> 1:07:35.593
- [Frank] Aamina?

1:07:35.593 --> 1:07:36.802
Aamina?
- Frank.

1:07:36.802 --> 1:07:37.887
- Oh, my god, Doc.

1:07:37.887 --> 1:07:39.138
Doc, what happened?

1:07:39.138 --> 1:07:40.306
Where is she?

1:07:40.306 --> 1:07:43.768
(footsteps pattering)
(Frank laughs)

1:07:43.768 --> 1:07:46.312
(gently sighs)

1:07:46.312 --> 1:07:47.521
Can I...

1:07:47.521 --> 1:07:48.647
Can I see her, please?

1:07:48.647 --> 1:07:49.815
- She's in surgery.

1:07:51.233 --> 1:07:52.109
(fists tapping)

1:07:52.109 --> 1:07:53.360
- They...

1:07:53.360 --> 1:07:54.987
They had to cut him out, Nathan.

1:07:56.322 --> 1:07:58.908
They said that the
accident killed him.

1:07:58.908 --> 1:08:00.785
There wasn't a fucking
scratch on the kid.

1:08:00.785 --> 1:08:02.828
Not a fucking scratch!

1:08:05.122 --> 1:08:08.709
Just try it, all right?
(indistinct voice echoing)

1:08:08.709 --> 1:08:10.336
Memory replacement can help.

1:08:12.755 --> 1:08:15.633
(dark ominous music)

1:08:15.633 --> 1:08:17.885
- That's a hell of a
thing for you to ask me.

1:08:20.554 --> 1:08:21.388
I deal it.

1:08:21.388 --> 1:08:22.681
I don't use it.

1:08:22.681 --> 1:08:26.602
(dark ominous music continues)

1:08:33.234 --> 1:08:35.528
(glass shattering)

1:08:35.528 --> 1:08:37.696
(Nathan yells indistinctly)

1:08:37.696 --> 1:08:39.698
(heavy breathing)

1:08:39.698 --> 1:08:42.660
(intense dramatic music)

1:08:42.660 --> 1:08:43.661
- Frank.

1:08:43.661 --> 1:08:45.246
- [Aamina] We're almost there.

1:08:45.246 --> 1:08:48.707
(intense whirring)
(electronic static)

1:08:48.707 --> 1:08:51.627
(car engine roars)

1:08:52.878 --> 1:08:54.296
(male breathes heavily)

1:08:54.296 --> 1:08:56.881
(female moans)

1:08:58.342 --> 1:09:00.051
(females laughing)

1:09:00.051 --> 1:09:02.846
(intense whirring)

1:09:02.846 --> 1:09:05.683
(male breathes shakily)

1:09:05.683 --> 1:09:07.559
- [Sketch] What the
fuck do you want?

1:09:07.559 --> 1:09:08.727
We can sit here
and talk all day.

1:09:08.727 --> 1:09:09.895
- [Junkie] Right, yeah, yeah.

1:09:09.895 --> 1:09:13.482
Well, are all the
memories pre-screened?

1:09:13.482 --> 1:09:14.733
- Pre-screened.

1:09:14.733 --> 1:09:16.152
What the fuck you
think this is, man?

1:09:16.152 --> 1:09:18.069
Fuckin' Walmart
Pharmacy or some shit?

1:09:18.069 --> 1:09:19.280
'Cause if that's the case,

1:09:19.280 --> 1:09:20.906
I need to see your prescription.

1:09:21.907 --> 1:09:24.577
(all laughing)

1:09:24.577 --> 1:09:26.912
(junkie laughs)

1:09:26.912 --> 1:09:29.415
(all continue laughing)

1:09:29.415 --> 1:09:32.667
(junkie continues laughing)

1:09:32.667 --> 1:09:34.044
- Yo, but look,

1:09:34.044 --> 1:09:36.422
I've had some fucked up
experiences before, man.

1:09:36.422 --> 1:09:38.381
- Look, look, look, look, look.

1:09:38.381 --> 1:09:39.842
I got money waitin' on me, man.

1:09:39.842 --> 1:09:41.385
You wastin' my time.

1:09:41.385 --> 1:09:43.012
You gonna buy or what?

1:09:43.012 --> 1:09:45.973
- Look, all memories
are pre-screened.

1:09:45.973 --> 1:09:48.809
Top of the line government-level
screening software.

1:09:48.809 --> 1:09:52.854
We remove all personal
identifiers, faces, names.

1:09:53.772 --> 1:09:57.193
We leave only the experience.

1:09:57.193 --> 1:09:58.652
- Unless it's sex.

1:09:58.652 --> 1:10:00.112
- But we have over

1:10:00.112 --> 1:10:03.115
one million different
erotic memory performers.

1:10:03.115 --> 1:10:06.160
The most visceral
experiences money can buy.

1:10:06.160 --> 1:10:08.913
- And the safest
sex money can buy.

1:10:08.913 --> 1:10:10.581
Just ask Bigg back there.

1:10:10.581 --> 1:10:12.124
Ain't that right, Bigg?

1:10:12.124 --> 1:10:15.460
Every paycheck that man gets
goes straight to this shit.

1:10:15.460 --> 1:10:19.465
He's on number 1,020,
and that's in his dome.

1:10:19.465 --> 1:10:21.800
In this world, dude's a Virgin.

1:10:21.800 --> 1:10:23.302
What you say, Bigg?

1:10:23.302 --> 1:10:24.929
Huh?

1:10:24.929 --> 1:10:25.971
(laughs) Look, he mad.

1:10:25.971 --> 1:10:27.181
All right, man, look,

1:10:27.181 --> 1:10:29.308
I'll give you a free one
on the house tonight,

1:10:29.308 --> 1:10:31.101
just show me that smile.

1:10:31.101 --> 1:10:33.187
(Sketch laughs and applauds)

1:10:33.187 --> 1:10:34.480
There you go!

1:10:34.480 --> 1:10:37.316
- So you guys got
everything, right?

1:10:37.316 --> 1:10:38.442
'Cause you know what
I'm really here for

1:10:38.442 --> 1:10:39.818
are those Three-Sixties.

1:10:39.818 --> 1:10:43.364
- Look, we have
everything and anything,

1:10:43.364 --> 1:10:45.699
disease free, no side effects.

1:10:45.699 --> 1:10:48.661
- Look, man, donkeys,
dogs, whatever the fuck,

1:10:48.661 --> 1:10:50.037
you in or what?

1:10:50.037 --> 1:10:51.371
- Do they expire?

1:10:51.371 --> 1:10:53.123
- Permanent's gonna
cost you extra, man.

1:10:53.123 --> 1:10:54.333
- That's cool, man.

1:10:54.333 --> 1:10:55.834
I will pay you
whatever it takes.

1:10:55.834 --> 1:10:57.002
- Well good, well good.

1:10:57.002 --> 1:10:58.337
Pull it out your pocket

1:10:58.337 --> 1:10:59.088
and let's get it crackin'.
(phone rings)

1:10:59.088 --> 1:10:59.880
Hold up.

1:11:01.048 --> 1:11:02.174
(Sketch clears throat)

1:11:02.174 --> 1:11:03.175
Speaker.
(electronic beeping)

1:11:03.175 --> 1:11:04.468
- Sketch?
- Boss Mama!

1:11:04.468 --> 1:11:06.262
(car engine roars)

1:11:06.262 --> 1:11:07.221
You just caught me in the middle

1:11:07.221 --> 1:11:08.013
of makin' a-
- Sketch.

1:11:08.013 --> 1:11:08.847
Is the room clear?

1:11:08.847 --> 1:11:09.848
- No way, Mama.

1:11:09.848 --> 1:11:11.267
It's a packed house upstairs.

1:11:11.267 --> 1:11:12.934
Suite numbers
flowin' downstairs.

1:11:12.934 --> 1:11:14.186
You know the deal.

1:11:14.186 --> 1:11:15.187
- I need the Hive
cleared, Sketch.

1:11:16.021 --> 1:11:16.855
- Wait, wait.

1:11:16.855 --> 1:11:18.190
Like a private party?

1:11:18.190 --> 1:11:20.025
You and Frankie boy
gonna get freaky?

1:11:20.943 --> 1:11:22.318
- Frank is gone.

1:11:22.318 --> 1:11:25.406
(dark ominous music)

1:11:25.406 --> 1:11:27.407
- Jackie, do your thing.

1:11:28.701 --> 1:11:29.994
- Sorry.

1:11:29.994 --> 1:11:31.537
- No, no, wait, wait, wait.

1:11:31.537 --> 1:11:32.454
I'm ready to buy.

1:11:34.415 --> 1:11:36.791
- Take this, come back later.

1:11:36.791 --> 1:11:39.545
30 minutes, Asian twins
expires after one week.

1:11:39.545 --> 1:11:40.379
You're welcome.

1:11:42.673 --> 1:11:43.507
- Oh, my god.

1:11:43.507 --> 1:11:44.717
Thank you so much.

1:11:44.717 --> 1:11:46.093
For real, on the house?

1:11:46.093 --> 1:11:46.927
That's cool?

1:11:46.927 --> 1:11:48.137
- [Jackie] Bigg!

1:11:48.137 --> 1:11:48.929
- [Bigg] Just take your
sample and go, man.

1:11:48.929 --> 1:11:49.638
- [Junkie] Oh, for real?

1:11:49.638 --> 1:11:51.056
Thank you.

1:11:51.056 --> 1:11:51.639
(car engine roars)
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1:11:51.639 --> 1:11:52.599
Hold up.

1:11:52.599 --> 1:11:53.559
You just said Frank was gone.

1:11:53.559 --> 1:11:54.393
- [Aamina] Frank's memories.

1:11:54.393 --> 1:11:54.684
Someone else's body.

1:11:55.853 --> 1:11:57.146
- What?

1:11:57.146 --> 1:11:58.063
Hold on, he...

1:11:58.063 --> 1:11:59.106
Frank got swapped?

1:12:00.566 --> 1:12:01.358
- Yeah.

1:12:03.027 --> 1:12:04.236
(car engine roars)
Sketch?

1:12:04.236 --> 1:12:05.070
- [Voice Of Sketch]
I got you, Mama.

1:12:05.070 --> 1:12:05.987
I got you, Mama.

1:12:05.987 --> 1:12:07.448
Head in to the Hive right now.

1:12:07.448 --> 1:12:08.407
- [Aamina] All right, I'm
pulling into the alley, okay?

1:12:08.407 --> 1:12:09.199
I'm coming into the front.

1:12:09.199 --> 1:12:10.451
Meet me out here.

1:12:10.451 --> 1:12:11.243
I'm gonna take him
through the club.

1:12:11.243 --> 1:12:13.746
(car engine roars)

1:12:13.746 --> 1:12:16.332
(dark ominous music)
(gun clatters)

1:12:16.332 --> 1:12:18.584
(electronic whirring)
(male breathes unsteadily)

1:12:18.584 --> 1:12:20.419
(female laughs)

1:12:20.419 --> 1:12:21.712
(door clatters open)

1:12:21.712 --> 1:12:23.547
- [Jackie] Get out!

1:12:23.547 --> 1:12:24.380
(gun cocks)

1:12:24.380 --> 1:12:25.924
(crowd screaming)

1:12:25.924 --> 1:12:26.842
Now!

1:12:26.842 --> 1:12:28.302
(crowd continues screaming)

1:12:28.302 --> 1:12:30.094
(indistinct yelling)
- Come on.

1:12:30.094 --> 1:12:31.013
Let's go.

1:12:31.013 --> 1:12:31.764
They're coming to the back.

1:12:31.764 --> 1:12:32.598
Let's go.

1:12:34.600 --> 1:12:36.101
(tires squealing)

1:12:36.101 --> 1:12:39.480
(car engine revs)

1:12:39.480 --> 1:12:41.231

1:12:41.231 --> 1:12:43.108
(car door clatters open)

1:12:43.108 --> 1:12:43.942
(car door slams shut)
- Everybody out!

1:12:43.942 --> 1:12:45.110
Clear the club now!

1:12:45.110 --> 1:12:46.445
Go, go, go!

1:12:46.445 --> 1:12:48.155
- [Doorman] Go,
seriously, go home.

1:12:48.155 --> 1:12:48.989
Go home, people.

1:12:48.989 --> 1:12:49.823
Call a friend.

1:12:49.823 --> 1:12:51.157
Go home.

1:12:51.157 --> 1:12:52.993
(rap music plays indistinctly
in the background)

1:12:52.993 --> 1:12:54.327
(car door slams shut)
- All right.

1:12:54.327 --> 1:12:58.832
(suspenseful dramatic music)

1:12:58.832 --> 1:12:59.958
- Aamina?

1:12:59.958 --> 1:13:01.710
- Frank.
- Aamina, Aamina.

1:13:03.754 --> 1:13:05.755
I'm sorry for everything.

1:13:07.508 --> 1:13:12.513
(indistinct chattering
in the background)

1:13:13.138 --> 1:13:14.681
- I know.

1:13:14.681 --> 1:13:18.519
(dramatic instrumental music)

1:13:22.773 --> 1:13:26.151
(footsteps clomping)
(indistinct chattering)

1:13:26.151 --> 1:13:27.193
- Hey, get out the way!
- Hey.

1:13:27.193 --> 1:13:28.695
Ditch the car, meet us inside.

1:13:28.695 --> 1:13:30.030
- Got it, boo.
- Come on, just-

1:13:30.030 --> 1:13:30.989
(rap music plays indistinctly
in the background)

1:13:30.989 --> 1:13:34.159
(indistinct chattering)

1:13:34.159 --> 1:13:35.411
Come on, roll!
- I am.

1:13:35.411 --> 1:13:36.245
- [Sketch] Roll!

1:13:36.245 --> 1:13:37.579
(indistinct chattering)

1:13:37.579 --> 1:13:42.166

1:13:47.172 --> 1:13:50.050
(suspenseful dramatic music)
(footsteps pattering)

1:13:50.050 --> 1:13:52.344
Mama, who the fuck is this guy?

1:13:52.344 --> 1:13:54.054
- [Aamina] He's got Frank
and whoever he is in there.

1:13:54.054 --> 1:13:55.139
He took a Reboot.

1:13:55.139 --> 1:13:56.348
- [Sketch] Damn.

1:13:56.348 --> 1:13:57.349
Where's Freddy?

1:13:57.349 --> 1:13:58.350
- [Aamina] Synapse got him.

1:13:58.350 --> 1:13:59.351
- [Sketch] What?

1:13:59.351 --> 1:14:00.686
Why the fuck you bring him then?

1:14:00.686 --> 1:14:01.687
- [Aamina] 'Cause he has a key

1:14:01.687 --> 1:14:02.938
to bring Synapse
down, all right?

1:14:02.938 --> 1:14:04.481
We need his mind access.

1:14:04.481 --> 1:14:06.316
- [Sketch] Mama, this is
way too much fuckin' heat.

1:14:06.316 --> 1:14:07.985

(siren wails in the distance)

1:14:19.288 --> 1:14:20.289
- New orders.

1:14:20.289 --> 1:14:21.540
After you get him,

1:14:21.540 --> 1:14:23.500
we need to bag whatever
tech they got inside.

1:14:23.500 --> 1:14:25.127
You take the side
entrance, I'll go front.

1:14:25.127 --> 1:14:28.297
(car doors clatter open)

1:14:28.297 --> 1:14:32.759

Get out the way!

1:14:35.219 --> 1:14:36.180
Move, move!

1:14:36.180 --> 1:14:36.889

1:14:50.235 --> 1:14:51.195
Put the gun down!
(gunshots firing)

1:14:51.195 --> 1:14:52.654
Put the fuckin' gun down!

1:14:52.654 --> 1:14:54.323

No!

1:14:59.870 --> 1:15:01.246
(interposing voices)

1:15:01.246 --> 1:15:03.040
- Drop your weapon.
- No, no!

1:15:03.040 --> 1:15:03.916
- Where am I?
- Frank.

1:15:03.916 --> 1:15:04.916
Listen to me.

1:15:04.916 --> 1:15:06.168
Listen to me.
- Who are you?

1:15:06.168 --> 1:15:07.628
- [Aamina] You're
almost there, baby.

1:15:07.628 --> 1:15:08.795
Frank, listen to my voice.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1:15:08.795 --> 1:15:10.005
- Put it down, Sketch.
- Start talking.

1:15:10.005 --> 1:15:11.298
Back up or he dies.
- Don't do this.

1:15:11.298 --> 1:15:12.257
Don't do this!

1:15:12.257 --> 1:15:13.258
- I'll kill him.
- Okay, stop.

1:15:13.258 --> 1:15:14.425
- Aamina!
- Stop!

1:15:14.425 --> 1:15:15.385
- Tell me something.
- I'll kill him!

1:15:15.385 --> 1:15:16.344

1:15:16.344 --> 1:15:17.888
- [Aamina] Frank, listen to me.

1:15:19.389 --> 1:15:21.225
Frank, we're almost there, baby.

1:15:21.225 --> 1:15:23.602
Frank, listen to my voice.

1:15:23.602 --> 1:15:24.895
Look!

Don't make me ask again.

1:15:56.677 --> 1:15:58.219
- The Warehouse.

1:15:58.219 --> 1:15:59.888
It's a club.

1:15:59.888 --> 1:16:01.557
- All right.

1:16:01.557 --> 1:16:03.934
Let's go get your friends, huh?

(Aamina breathes heavily)

1:16:09.648 --> 1:16:11.066
- [Aamina] Lock the door, Bigg.

1:16:11.066 --> 1:16:13.360
Don't let anyone else
in but Jackie, okay?

1:16:13.360 --> 1:16:15.487
Sketch, get the link runnin'.

1:16:17.155 --> 1:16:18.365
(Nathan groans)

1:16:18.365 --> 1:16:19.157
- [Sketch] Before
we upload anything,

1:16:19.157 --> 1:16:20.409
we need to identify.

1:16:20.409 --> 1:16:23.036
(keyboard clacking)
(electronic whirring)

1:16:23.036 --> 1:16:24.621
(computer beeping)

1:16:24.621 --> 1:16:26.290
(keyboard continues clacking)

1:16:26.290 --> 1:16:29.376
(footsteps clomping)

1:16:30.502 --> 1:16:32.170
(metal clangs)

1:16:32.170 --> 1:16:35.549
(elevator door clatters)

1:16:37.092 --> 1:16:41.013
(motor whooshing and rumbling)

1:16:47.144 --> 1:16:48.103
- Okay.
- Hey!

1:16:48.103 --> 1:16:48.937
What are you doing?

1:16:48.937 --> 1:16:50.188
- Relax.

1:16:50.188 --> 1:16:51.106
It's just a little
neurostrablizer.

1:16:51.106 --> 1:16:52.107
Help keep your head clear.

1:16:52.107 --> 1:16:53.692
Take the edge off a little bit.

1:16:53.692 --> 1:16:55.360
- It's okay.
(Nathan breathes shakily)

1:16:55.360 --> 1:16:56.570
- [Nathan] Okay.

1:16:56.570 --> 1:16:57.404
Okay.

1:16:58.280 --> 1:16:59.615
(Nathan groans)

1:16:59.615 --> 1:17:02.034
Okay, okay.
(keyboard clacking)

1:17:02.034 --> 1:17:03.535
- [Sketch] Shit, I got
nothin' to work with.

1:17:03.535 --> 1:17:05.454
His memory's all over
the fuckin' place.

1:17:05.454 --> 1:17:06.705
Okay, I got it.
(electronic whooshing)

1:17:06.705 --> 1:17:08.040
I got access to the
Synapse database.

1:17:08.040 --> 1:17:09.458
- [Aamina] Do you have a match?

1:17:09.458 --> 1:17:10.375
- I don't know.

1:17:10.375 --> 1:17:11.627
I'm searching archive mem files

1:17:11.627 --> 1:17:12.628
to match the image
feed from his mind.

1:17:12.628 --> 1:17:16.005
(intense dramatic music)

1:17:16.005 --> 1:17:16.840
Shit!

1:17:16.840 --> 1:17:17.758
- No!

1:17:17.758 --> 1:17:19.843
(gun cocks)
No, no, no, no!

1:17:19.843 --> 1:17:21.386
He was working with Frank.

1:17:21.386 --> 1:17:22.219
- How you know?

1:17:22.219 --> 1:17:23.513
- 'Cause Freddy told me.

1:17:23.513 --> 1:17:25.014
All right, he has the
key in there, Sketch,

1:17:25.014 --> 1:17:27.059
so we need to upload the
memory, the original memory,

1:17:27.059 --> 1:17:27.934
whatever is left of it.

1:17:27.934 --> 1:17:29.186
Sketch, do it!

1:17:29.186 --> 1:17:30.978
- Aamina, we upload, it
wipes the cover, okay?

1:17:30.978 --> 1:17:33.190
This memory under Frank's
memories will eat his ass up.

1:17:33.190 --> 1:17:34.566
- You have to find another way!

1:17:34.566 --> 1:17:35.651
- [Sketch] I can't, I can't!

1:17:35.651 --> 1:17:36.568
- Do it, Sketch.

1:17:36.568 --> 1:17:37.818
- Not here.
- Do it!

1:17:37.818 --> 1:17:38.987
- I'm not doing that shit.
- Do it.

1:17:38.987 --> 1:17:39.780
- Frank, no.
- Fuck that shit!

1:17:39.780 --> 1:17:40.989
- Just do it, do it!

1:17:40.989 --> 1:17:41.907
- Sketch.
- Listen, y'all motherfuckers-

1:17:41.907 --> 1:17:43.325
- Upload the memories, Sketch

1:17:43.325 --> 1:17:44.242
Upload the memory folder.
- He will be gone!

1:17:44.242 --> 1:17:45.327
- Frank, no!
- Wait!

1:17:45.327 --> 1:17:46.370
- You have to find it!
- I can't-

1:17:46.370 --> 1:17:47.287
Aamina!
- Find a way, Sketch!

1:17:47.287 --> 1:17:48.246
- Do it, do it!
- We can't!

1:17:48.246 --> 1:17:49.456
We can't!
- Just do it.

1:17:49.456 --> 1:17:50.707
- He will be gone.
- Do it, do it.

1:17:50.707 --> 1:17:52.209
- Okay?
- Upload the code, Sketch.

1:17:52.209 --> 1:17:53.418
- Only thing left will be
this agent, Nathan Stafford,

1:17:53.418 --> 1:17:54.252
and then we gotta
deal with that shit.

1:17:54.252 --> 1:17:55.420
- [Aamina] I know.

1:17:55.420 --> 1:17:56.088
I say we save Frank.
- Do it, Sketch!

1:17:56.088 --> 1:17:57.047
Do it now!

1:17:57.047 --> 1:17:58.255
- Do not make me do this.

1:17:58.255 --> 1:17:59.966
Do not make me say
goodbye to you.

1:18:00.842 --> 1:18:02.844
- You know we have to do this.

1:18:06.223 --> 1:18:08.809
It's the one thing
my mind agrees on.

1:18:11.937 --> 1:18:14.940
Aamina, let me go.

1:18:15.898 --> 1:18:19.568
(somber instrumental music)

1:18:25.492 --> 1:18:26.660
- Wait!

1:18:26.660 --> 1:18:30.914
(somber instrumental
music swells)

1:18:56.022 --> 1:18:57.023
Remember me.

1:18:59.025 --> 1:19:01.486
(somber instrumental
music continues)

1:19:01.486 --> 1:19:05.240
(suspenseful dramatic music)

1:19:06.992 --> 1:19:08.493
(electronic buzzing)
(intense whirring)

1:19:08.493 --> 1:19:10.245
(Nathan yells out painfully)

1:19:10.245 --> 1:19:12.581
(electronic buzzing)
(static hissing)

1:19:12.581 --> 1:19:15.791
- The code to crash
the Synapse system is

1:19:15.791 --> 1:19:19.087
1-9-7-9-0-0-7-0-3.

1:19:21.423 --> 1:19:24.593
(electronic whirring)

1:19:31.850 --> 1:19:33.268
(intense dramatic music)
(gunshot firing)

1:19:33.268 --> 1:19:36.480
(bullet casing clanks)
(Bigg thuds)

1:19:36.480 --> 1:19:39.316
(gunshots firing)

1:19:41.777 --> 1:19:43.068
(glass shattering)

1:19:43.068 --> 1:19:46.740
(gunshots continue firing)

1:19:55.707 --> 1:19:56.625
- [Nathan] Loose ends?

1:19:56.625 --> 1:19:59.044
- Yeah, our runners, we pop 'em.

1:19:59.044 --> 1:20:00.295
Can't have a bunch of mem heads

1:20:00.295 --> 1:20:01.713
runnin' around with our info.

1:20:03.465 --> 1:20:05.592
- [Frank] I'm sorry, man.

1:20:05.592 --> 1:20:07.719
Sorry I'm telling you-
- You gotta go.

1:20:07.719 --> 1:20:08.804
You gotta go now.

1:20:08.804 --> 1:20:10.055
We're blown.

1:20:10.055 --> 1:20:11.181
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

1:20:11.181 --> 1:20:12.641
- No, no, no, I-
- They sent me over here

1:20:12.641 --> 1:20:13.725
to kill you.

1:20:13.725 --> 1:20:14.976
- [Frank] What are we gonna do?

1:20:14.976 --> 1:20:17.562
- Get your girl,
grab the contacts,

1:20:17.562 --> 1:20:18.814
and we'll give you a call,
(gunshots firing)

1:20:18.814 --> 1:20:21.273
and we'll come get
you in an hour.

1:20:21.273 --> 1:20:24.402
(gunshots continue firing)

1:20:24.402 --> 1:20:25.987
702, it's 303.

1:20:27.239 --> 1:20:28.073
Frank's dead.

1:20:29.825 --> 1:20:31.952
(electronic whirring)

1:20:31.952 --> 1:20:35.621
(somber instrumental music)

1:20:37.916 --> 1:20:41.378
(car door clatters open)

1:20:43.046 --> 1:20:45.465
(gun cocks)
(door slams shut)

1:20:45.465 --> 1:20:47.175
I just need you to
listen to me, okay?

1:20:47.175 --> 1:20:48.425
Baby, listen.

1:20:48.425 --> 1:20:49.636
I need you to grab
Sam, get his clothes,

1:20:49.636 --> 1:20:51.429
head over to the
End Hotel, room 3C.

1:20:51.429 --> 1:20:52.681
I'll meet you there.

1:20:52.681 --> 1:20:54.766
(electronic whirring)

1:20:54.766 --> 1:20:56.518
(gunshots firing)

1:20:56.518 --> 1:21:00.146
(somber instrumental music)

1:21:04.901 --> 1:21:07.487
(gunshots firing)
(Nathan breathes heavily)

1:21:07.487 --> 1:21:08.822
No, no, no, no, no.

1:21:08.822 --> 1:21:13.326
(somber instrumental
music continues)

1:21:15.662 --> 1:21:17.080
Frank.

1:21:17.080 --> 1:21:18.748
(gunshot firing)

1:21:18.748 --> 1:21:21.251
(Frank thuds)

1:21:24.045 --> 1:21:25.964
(gunshots firing)

1:21:25.964 --> 1:21:30.969
(somber instrumental
music continues)

1:21:32.429 --> 1:21:33.013
- [Agent 702] At lease we
didn't orphan your kid.

1:21:34.180 --> 1:21:37.434
(gunshot firing)
(bullet casing clanks)

1:21:37.434 --> 1:21:41.228
(ominous dramatic music)
(gunshots firing)

1:21:41.228 --> 1:21:42.731
(electronic static whirring)

1:21:42.731 --> 1:21:45.609
- Frank, I need your contacts.

1:21:45.609 --> 1:21:48.653
(footsteps clomping)

1:21:49.987 --> 1:21:54.117
(somber instrumental music)

1:21:54.117 --> 1:21:57.954
(gunshot firing)
(Aamina gasps)

1:21:57.954 --> 1:21:59.121
Give me your password, Frank.

1:21:59.121 --> 1:22:00.165
Come on.

1:22:00.165 --> 1:22:04.002
- Carter.
- Carter.

1:22:04.002 --> 1:22:06.796
(electronic beeping)

1:22:06.796 --> 1:22:10.675
(somber instrumental

(gunshot firing)

1:22:26.441 --> 1:22:28.109
(electronic whirring)

1:22:28.109 --> 1:22:29.527
- [Frank] What's a guy like me

1:22:31.112 --> 1:22:33.323
gotta do to run away
with a girl like you?

1:22:33.323 --> 1:22:37.035
(intense dramatic tones)

1:22:37.035 --> 1:22:38.327
(gunshots firing)
- Stop!

1:22:38.327 --> 1:22:41.915
(gunshots continue firing)

1:22:47.295 --> 1:22:50.298
(alarm sounds)

1:23:06.398 --> 1:23:10.193
(suspenseful dramatic music)

1:23:16.741 --> 1:23:21.121
(Aamina breathes heavily)

1:23:21.121 --> 1:23:23.081
- Drop the gun.

1:23:23.081 --> 1:23:24.374
- [Agent 702]
Welcome back, buddy.

1:23:24.374 --> 1:23:25.791
Perfect timing.

1:23:25.791 --> 1:23:27.585
He and I go way back.

1:23:27.585 --> 1:23:28.753
You didn't know that, did you?

1:23:28.753 --> 1:23:30.130
Killed Frank.

1:23:30.130 --> 1:23:30.964
- He's lying.

1:23:31.965 --> 1:23:33.425
He told me to kill Frank.

1:23:33.425 --> 1:23:34.259
(male moaning)
(gunshot firing)

1:23:34.259 --> 1:23:35.385
(bullet casing clanks)

1:23:35.385 --> 1:23:37.469
Frank told me about your son.

1:23:37.469 --> 1:23:38.972
- [Agent 702] He told
you his name was Nathan?

1:23:38.972 --> 1:23:40.514
Synapse agents don't have names.

1:23:40.514 --> 1:23:43.434
(gunshot firing)
(Agent 702 groans painfully)

1:23:43.434 --> 1:23:47.355
(Agent 702 continues groaning)

1:23:48.982 --> 1:23:49.941
(gun cocks)

1:23:49.941 --> 1:23:52.485
(Agent 702 continues groaning)

1:23:52.485 --> 1:23:54.112
- You know you can trust me.

1:23:54.112 --> 1:23:55.280
- [Agent 702] Don't
listen to him, Aamina.

1:23:55.280 --> 1:23:56.322
He's lying.

1:23:56.322 --> 1:23:57.157
- Shut up.

1:23:58.742 --> 1:24:00.243
Tie his hands behind his back.

1:24:02.162 --> 1:24:03.371
Go on.

1:24:03.371 --> 1:24:07.125
(Agent 702 groans painfully)

1:24:09.585 --> 1:24:10.628
Shut up.

1:24:10.628 --> 1:24:14.591
(Agent 702 continues groaning)

1:24:16.009 --> 1:24:17.343
Take care of your friend.

1:24:18.511 --> 1:24:19.471
Go on.

1:24:19.471 --> 1:24:23.391
(Agent 702 continues groaning)

1:24:25.059 --> 1:24:26.436
Get up!
(Agent 702 grunts painfully)

1:24:26.436 --> 1:24:28.103
- [Agent 702] Fuck!

1:24:30.231 --> 1:24:31.858
What you wanna
do, shoot me, huh?

1:24:34.318 --> 1:24:35.737
What are you doing?

1:24:35.737 --> 1:24:38.406
(Agent 702 groans painfully)

1:24:38.406 --> 1:24:39.824
- [Nathan] Nothing, I'm
just gonna scan you.

1:24:39.824 --> 1:24:41.326
See what you know.

1:24:41.326 --> 1:24:43.286
- What are you doing?

1:24:43.286 --> 1:24:45.163
- I'm gonna take your contacts.

1:24:45.163 --> 1:24:46.456
(electronic buzzing)
- No.

1:24:46.456 --> 1:24:49.709
(electronic buzzing continues)

1:24:49.709 --> 1:24:52.879
(electronic whirring)

1:25:05.725 --> 1:25:07.184
The op.

1:25:07.184 --> 1:25:08.603
The op, did we get the tech?

1:25:10.522 --> 1:25:12.107
What are you doing?

1:25:12.107 --> 1:25:13.775
What are you doing?

1:25:16.027 --> 1:25:17.195
- I was an op.

1:25:18.362 --> 1:25:19.864
You killed my family.

1:25:21.199 --> 1:25:22.032
- What?

1:25:23.034 --> 1:25:24.369
No, no, no, no.

1:25:26.204 --> 1:25:29.874
(electronic whirring)
(gunshot firing)

1:25:29.874 --> 1:25:33.878
(electronic whirring continues)

1:25:34.796 --> 1:25:35.672
That's not me.

1:25:35.672 --> 1:25:36.505
That's a lie.

1:25:36.505 --> 1:25:37.465
That's not me!

1:25:37.465 --> 1:25:38.716
That is not me!

1:25:38.716 --> 1:25:40.343
(Agent 702 groans painfully)

1:25:40.343 --> 1:25:41.386
- Look, look!

1:25:43.888 --> 1:25:44.848
- [Agent 702] I've been set up.

1:25:44.848 --> 1:25:45.849
That's not me.

1:25:45.849 --> 1:25:47.809
(gunshot firing)

1:25:47.809 --> 1:25:49.644
- That's not you?

1:25:49.644 --> 1:25:51.563
That's in my head, you fuck!
- All right.

1:25:51.563 --> 1:25:53.731
(Agent 702 breathes shakily)

1:25:53.731 --> 1:25:55.400
Like I said, that's not me.

1:25:55.400 --> 1:26:00.405
(electronic whirring)
(Nathan breathes heavily)

1:26:02.240 --> 1:26:03.575
- Look at me.

1:26:03.575 --> 1:26:04.409
Look at me.

1:26:04.409 --> 1:26:06.244
I've been where you are,

1:26:08.496 --> 1:26:10.081
and I know deep down,

1:26:11.791 --> 1:26:13.251
deep down, you fuckin' remember.

1:26:13.251 --> 1:26:14.502
(gunshot firing)

1:26:14.502 --> 1:26:17.130
(bullet casing clanks)
(intense dramatic music)

1:26:17.130 --> 1:26:19.215
(gun clicks)

1:26:19.215 --> 1:26:21.009
(Nathan breathes heavily)

1:26:21.009 --> 1:26:25.263
(intense dramatic
music continues)

1:26:33.646 --> 1:26:34.898
We have to go.

1:26:36.816 --> 1:26:39.110
(Sketch groans painfully)

1:26:39.110 --> 1:26:40.278
- [Sketch] Go!

1:26:40.278 --> 1:26:41.237
Fuck!

1:26:41.237 --> 1:26:43.239
(gun clicks)

1:26:43.239 --> 1:26:45.200
(Sketch groans painfully)

1:26:45.200 --> 1:26:47.035
(footsteps clomping)

1:26:47.035 --> 1:26:47.869
Oh, fuck.

1:26:50.955 --> 1:26:52.207
Fuck!

1:26:52.207 --> 1:26:54.876
(intense dramatic
music continues)

1:26:54.876 --> 1:26:57.545
(Sketch groans)

1:26:58.630 --> 1:27:01.341
(waves crashing)

1:27:02.967 --> 1:27:06.429
(gentle orchestral music)

1:27:08.473 --> 1:27:09.849
- [Nathan] What is the soul?

1:27:12.059 --> 1:27:12.977
Is there a soul?

1:27:14.020 --> 1:27:16.648
What makes us us?

1:27:17.982 --> 1:27:20.318
Is it our experiences,
our memories?

1:27:22.403 --> 1:27:25.156
What are the things
we can't remember?

1:27:25.156 --> 1:27:26.950
Feelings, the impressions,

1:27:26.950 --> 1:27:30.827
that gut reaction
that has no basis?

1:27:30.827 --> 1:27:33.248
No origin that we can recall?

1:27:33.248 --> 1:27:34.791
If we wipe our memories,

1:27:35.959 --> 1:27:37.335
can we still be who we are?

1:27:40.463 --> 1:27:42.298
(car engine roars)

1:27:42.298 --> 1:27:45.969
(gentle orchestral
music continues)

1:27:45.969 --> 1:27:48.554
(cars roaring)

1:27:54.102 --> 1:27:57.814
(car door clatters open)

1:27:57.814 --> 1:28:00.692
(car door slams shut)

1:28:00.692 --> 1:28:03.443
(waves crashing)

1:28:09.409 --> 1:28:12.537
(seagulls squawking)

1:28:17.208 --> 1:28:20.712
(waves continue crashing)

1:28:28.719 --> 1:28:29.554
- So what now?

1:28:31.014 --> 1:28:32.056
- Find the source.

1:28:33.224 --> 1:28:35.518
I'm gonna locate every
one of 702's contacts

1:28:35.518 --> 1:28:36.477
and burn it down.

1:28:38.563 --> 1:28:39.397
- You or we?

1:28:44.193 --> 1:28:45.278
- All right, we.

1:28:46.154 --> 1:28:49.574
(waves crashing)

1:28:49.574 --> 1:28:50.407
- What?

1:28:52.577 --> 1:28:53.619
- Just a thought.

1:28:55.913 --> 1:28:58.041
Is how a guy like me

1:28:58.041 --> 1:29:00.251
can end up running away
with a girl like you?

1:29:02.210 --> 1:29:05.630
