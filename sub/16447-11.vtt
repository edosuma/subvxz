The Big Bang Theory...

00:03.254 --> 00:04.114
Hey, Stuart.

00:04.115 --> 00:04.877
What are you doing here?

00:04.901 --> 00:06.583
Oh, I'm living here again.

00:06.584 --> 00:09.885
Do, uh, Howard
and Bernadette know?

00:09.887 --> 00:13.422
Or is like a possum
in the walls kind of thing?

00:14.258 --> 00:17.059
No. I needed
a place to stay,

00:17.061 --> 00:18.293
and with the baby coming,

00:18.295 --> 00:20.262
I figured they could
use some extra help.

00:20.264 --> 00:22.598
Hey, tomorrow, who wants
to paint the nursery?

00:22.600 --> 00:23.628
I'll do it.

00:23.629 --> 00:25.433
Why do you get to do it?
I'm the artist.

00:25.703 --> 00:28.704
Just because you're starving
doesn't make you an artist.

00:28.706 --> 00:32.040
Just because I look sickly
doesn't mean I'm starving.

00:32.042 --> 00:34.176
Howard?

00:34.178 --> 00:36.345
I think I'm in labor.

00:36.347 --> 00:38.313
Oh. Oh, okay. Okay.

00:38.315 --> 00:40.215
Uh, uh, uh,
I can do this.

00:40.217 --> 00:41.650
We have a plan.

00:41.652 --> 00:43.518
Somebody please
tell me the plan!

00:43.520 --> 00:45.053
I'll get the
hospital bag.

00:45.055 --> 00:45.765
I'll pull the van up.

00:45.789 --> 00:46.890
Meet you outside
in two minutes.

00:46.891 --> 00:49.358
Team Baby, go!

00:52.263 --> 00:53.829
<i>Oh, man.</i>

00:53.831 --> 00:55.297
This is really
happening.

00:55.299 --> 00:56.999
You doin' okay?

00:57.001 --> 00:58.600
Here comes another contraction.

00:58.602 --> 00:59.968
Let's pick it up!

00:59.970 --> 01:01.436
All right, hold on.

01:01.438 --> 01:03.272
I'm gonna drive
like we do in India.

01:03.274 --> 01:07.943
Get out of my way,
you syphilitic dogs!

01:09.313 --> 01:11.040
Stop that!
This isn't India.

01:11.064 --> 01:11.981
Fine.

01:11.982 --> 01:16.885
What do one point three billion
people know about having babies?

01:16.887 --> 01:19.388
Sorry. I know you were just
trying to help.

01:20.090 --> 01:21.356
I love you.

01:21.358 --> 01:23.992
I love you, too.

Wake up.

01:58.799 --> 02:01.499
Wh... What's wrong?

02:01.501 --> 02:03.268
It's midnight.

02:03.270 --> 02:04.769
Happy birthday.

02:04.771 --> 02:07.972
Sheldon.

02:12.279 --> 02:17.182
Okay, you can have
this back in the morning.

02:17.184 --> 02:20.151
This is for you.

02:20.153 --> 02:21.519
I was going to wrap it,

02:21.521 --> 02:24.389
but touching Scotch tape
gives me the heebie-jeebies.

02:24.391 --> 02:27.859
I'll put in on the list
with peaches and felt.

02:29.529 --> 02:31.596
What is this?

02:31.598 --> 02:35.066
A functional MRI
of my brain.

02:35.068 --> 02:39.137
I did Sudoku before they
took it so I'd be ripped.

02:39.139 --> 02:42.173
I love it. Thank you.

02:42.175 --> 02:43.475
And it's not just an MRI.

02:43.477 --> 02:45.043
The orbitofrontal
cortex is lit up

02:45.045 --> 02:47.245
because I was
thinking of you.

02:47.247 --> 02:49.681
Sheldon!

02:53.253 --> 02:56.387
We seem to be moving on
to the annual coitus portion

02:56.389 --> 02:57.989
of your birthday
festivities.

02:57.991 --> 03:00.191
Is that okay?

03:00.193 --> 03:03.027
I didn't put on my come-hither
plaid PJ's for nothing.

03:05.031 --> 03:07.398
You hate Scotch tape,
but you love Scotch plaid.

03:07.400 --> 03:09.767
You are a mystery.

03:17.210 --> 03:18.776
Guys, wake up!

03:18.778 --> 03:20.545
Bernadette's
having her baby!

03:20.547 --> 03:22.413
Come on, we're going
to the hospital!

03:22.415 --> 03:24.449
I guess... I guess
we should stop.

03:24.451 --> 03:26.384
Yeah. I'm afraid so.

03:28.155 --> 03:30.555
Childbirth,
looming coitus?

03:30.557 --> 03:33.224
This is a banner night
for female genitals.

03:35.896 --> 03:37.862
Now I see
three of you.

03:37.864 --> 03:41.599
Do we know the father, or is
this some <i>Mamma Mia</i> nonsense?

03:41.601 --> 03:44.102
I'm the father.

03:44.104 --> 03:46.905
Okay, Dad, how far apart
are the contractions?

03:46.907 --> 03:49.774
No idea.
Ask him.

03:49.776 --> 03:51.476
12 minutes.

03:51.478 --> 03:53.711
12 minutes?
Why are you here?

03:53.713 --> 03:56.114
Aren't we supposed to get here
an hour and a half early?

03:56.116 --> 03:59.250
This is a hospital,
not the airport.

04:00.187 --> 04:02.387
I'm sorry.
It's our first time.

04:02.389 --> 04:03.521
It's okay.

04:03.523 --> 04:05.723
This little one will be
here before you know it.

04:05.725 --> 04:07.592
Do we know what
we're having?

04:07.594 --> 04:09.160
No, we're keeping it
a surprise.

04:09.162 --> 04:11.262
Old school. Nice.

04:11.264 --> 04:14.265
Not <i>that</i> old school.
He knows.

04:14.267 --> 04:18.136
You see, I was
at the doctor's office,

04:18.137 --> 04:21.305
the folder was right there,
so I took a peek.

04:21.308 --> 04:23.541
And talking like this

04:23.543 --> 04:26.678
doesn't make it less creepy.

04:26.680 --> 04:27.946
Sweetheart, go home.

04:27.948 --> 04:29.414
Come back when
the contractions

04:29.416 --> 04:31.115
are five minutes
apart for an hour.

04:31.117 --> 04:32.317
I'm sorry.

04:32.319 --> 04:33.551
That's ambiguous.

04:33.553 --> 04:35.987
Is it five minutes apart
starting at the top of the hour,

04:35.989 --> 04:37.288
or five minutes apart starting

04:37.290 --> 04:41.392
with the first contraction, so
essentially, like, 65 minutes?

04:41.394 --> 04:44.329
I'm just throwing
this out there,

04:44.331 --> 04:47.732
but home births are
very popular these days.

04:50.637 --> 04:52.804
Sheldon, what took you so long?

04:52.806 --> 04:54.405
Wolowitz might
hand out cigars.

04:54.407 --> 04:56.074
I had to find my bubble gum

04:56.076 --> 04:59.544
cigar so I could join in
without looking foolish.

04:59.546 --> 05:01.713
Damn, I need my inhaler.

05:01.715 --> 05:02.880
Just don't smoke.

05:02.882 --> 05:04.782
No, I went down
the stairs too fast.

05:06.253 --> 05:07.685
Hey.

05:07.687 --> 05:09.754
Don't come to the hospital.
We're headed home.

05:09.756 --> 05:12.156
Oh, that was fast.
Did she sneeze the baby out?

05:12.158 --> 05:15.260
We showed up too early.
We'll keep you posted.

05:15.262 --> 05:16.861
Okay, well, we'll

05:16.863 --> 05:18.263
talk to you guys later. Bye.

05:18.265 --> 05:21.065
She said not to come.
It's gonna be a while.

05:21.067 --> 05:23.701
Well, first deliveries
can be slow.

05:23.703 --> 05:27.338
I am starting to rethink the
Flash onesie I bought this kid.

05:28.008 --> 05:30.275
I found it,
but it's empty.

05:30.277 --> 05:32.277
Well, it doesn't matter. We're
not going to the hospital now.

05:32.279 --> 05:34.879
Are you sure?
I'd really like to.

05:35.715 --> 05:39.183
Well, should we,
uh, head back up?

05:39.185 --> 05:41.352
Come on, guys.

05:41.354 --> 05:43.554
We're all awake. Why don't we go
to a diner or something?

05:43.556 --> 05:45.189
Oh, uh, I don't know.

05:45.191 --> 05:48.760
Sheldon, you don't want
to do that, do you?

05:48.762 --> 05:50.094
It doesn't matter what I want.

05:50.096 --> 05:52.463
- It's your birthday. You decide.
- Oh, my God!

05:52.465 --> 05:54.732
It's your birthday!
Let's do something fun.

05:54.734 --> 05:55.767
- Uh...
- Well,

05:55.769 --> 05:56.601
we could go to a bar.

05:56.603 --> 05:59.103
Well...

05:59.105 --> 06:01.873
Okay, I can breathe again.
Babe, they want to have sex.

06:01.875 --> 06:03.708
Oh, of course!

06:03.710 --> 06:07.745
The annual birthday
booty spectacular!

06:07.747 --> 06:09.580
That's a bit childish,
isn't it?

06:09.582 --> 06:12.684
I'm sorry, and what flavor is
your bubble gum cigar?

06:12.686 --> 06:17.722
Grape. I find it
the most mild.

06:17.724 --> 06:20.391
All right, well,
you two go have fun.

06:23.663 --> 06:27.231
If we find my backup inhaler,
maybe we can get frisky.

06:27.233 --> 06:30.968
Oh, you sexy,
wheezy little man.

06:33.573 --> 06:35.373
Do you really need
to record this?

06:35.375 --> 06:38.009
You'll be happy I did.

06:38.011 --> 06:41.713
Okay, little one,
here we are back at home

06:41.715 --> 06:43.848
because you weren't quite ready
to come out yet.

06:43.850 --> 06:47.085
You wanted to make an entrance.
I get it.

06:48.988 --> 06:52.190
And here's your daddy.

06:52.192 --> 06:54.892
When he tries to tell
you he used to be cool,

06:54.894 --> 06:57.462
you can see he wasn't.

06:59.833 --> 07:01.999
All right,
enough with the camera.

07:02.001 --> 07:04.135
Well, this is not for me.
This is for the baby.

07:04.137 --> 07:06.170
Some day she's gonna
want to see this.

07:06.172 --> 07:08.106
I'm sorry.

07:08.108 --> 07:10.441
<i>Who's</i> gonna want to see this?

07:11.478 --> 07:16.381
I... I said “she,”
but lots of things are she--

07:16.383 --> 07:17.615
boats

07:17.617 --> 07:18.783
and cars,

07:18.785 --> 07:21.652
whales.
Like, “Thar she blows.”

07:23.590 --> 07:25.189
You're doing great.

07:26.059 --> 07:27.925
Raj!

07:27.927 --> 07:29.494
Well, okay,
I'm gonna sign off now.

07:29.496 --> 07:31.963
This next part may contain
some adult language.

07:31.965 --> 07:33.331
How could you?!

07:33.333 --> 07:35.366
We made it this
far without knowing,

07:35.368 --> 07:37.034
and you ruined it!

07:37.036 --> 07:38.636
Well, you guys have no idea
how hard it is

07:38.638 --> 07:40.938
to know something like this
and not say it!

07:40.940 --> 07:43.408
You told me it was a girl,
and I didn't say it.

07:43.410 --> 07:45.076
Raj!
You were supposed

07:45.078 --> 07:46.644
to keep that to yourself.

07:46.646 --> 07:51.015
Oh, yeah. I guess it is hard.

07:53.520 --> 07:56.254
So...

07:56.256 --> 07:57.955
...where were we?

07:57.957 --> 07:59.891
Well, I believe

07:59.893 --> 08:02.160
we were kissing like
randy teenagers,

08:02.162 --> 08:06.264
and your nose was
whistling ever so slightly.

08:06.266 --> 08:09.000
I'm sorry.

08:09.002 --> 08:10.234
Oh, don't be.

08:10.236 --> 08:12.437
You were like a
foxy tea kettle.

08:14.707 --> 08:17.175
Well, shall we start over?

08:17.177 --> 08:18.976
Very well.

08:25.518 --> 08:27.084
What's wrong?

08:27.086 --> 08:29.086
I'm not sure.

08:29.088 --> 08:31.389
Earlier tonight, things
began organically,

08:31.391 --> 08:33.057
and now it's
feeling forced,

08:33.058 --> 08:37.061
like all the <i>Pirates</i>
<i>of the Caribbean</i> sequels.

08:38.898 --> 08:40.832
Okay, that makes sense.

08:40.833 --> 08:43.534
I mean, the mood's
a little different now.

08:43.535 --> 08:44.936
We-we don't have to rush.

08:44.938 --> 08:47.905
Oh, I know, but Leonard and
Penny think we're doing it,

08:47.907 --> 08:50.274
and I don't want
to disappoint them.

08:52.479 --> 08:55.546
And the mood continues
to change.

08:55.548 --> 08:57.782
No, and also, I don't
want to disappoint you. I...

08:57.784 --> 09:00.017
You know, come on.
It's your birthday.

09:00.019 --> 09:02.186
I can soldier through this.

09:03.323 --> 09:04.989
H-Hold on.

09:04.991 --> 09:07.492
I think I might have
a little surprise

09:07.494 --> 09:12.296
that might help get things
back on track.

09:12.298 --> 09:14.398
Intriguing.

09:14.400 --> 09:16.234
Is “back on track” a hint

09:16.236 --> 09:18.202
that it has something
to do with trains?

09:20.473 --> 09:22.907
No.

09:22.909 --> 09:25.610
Because if it did have to do
with trains, and you were

09:25.612 --> 09:27.545
gonna give...
It's not about trains!

09:27.547 --> 09:29.881
Oh. Not even a cozy sleeper
car on the Orient Express?

09:29.883 --> 09:32.083
Stop talking
about trains!

09:33.386 --> 09:36.387
Who's killing the mood now?

09:38.424 --> 09:40.725
Found the backup inhaler.
Want to have sex?

09:42.729 --> 09:45.329
Well, I didn't
until I heard that.

09:45.331 --> 09:47.598
Hang on. I'm counting.

09:48.568 --> 09:50.434
It's okay.
Mm.

09:53.907 --> 09:55.973
Hello!

09:55.975 --> 09:57.375
Howard and Bernadette
kicked me out

09:57.377 --> 09:59.443
because I told them
they're having a girl!

10:00.246 --> 10:02.747
Oopsy, I did it again.

10:04.784 --> 10:07.118
Maybe if we're quiet,
he'll go away.

10:07.120 --> 10:11.355
You're gonna
have to be quieter than that.

10:12.559 --> 10:13.925
Can I look yet?

10:13.927 --> 10:15.860
One second.

10:15.862 --> 10:18.696
All right,
you can open your eyes.

10:24.637 --> 10:26.771
I thought I'd let Harry Potter

10:26.773 --> 10:30.174
make things hotter.

10:32.111 --> 10:33.811
Wowza.

10:35.848 --> 10:38.516
I got a Gryffindor robe
for you.

10:38.518 --> 10:39.617
Oh...

10:39.619 --> 10:42.653
A Gryffindor sleeping
with a Hufflepuff?

10:43.489 --> 10:45.456
How scandalous.

10:48.094 --> 10:51.362
You naughty girl.

10:51.364 --> 10:54.365
You went to the Wizarding World
theme park without me.

10:54.367 --> 10:56.701
I did.

10:56.703 --> 10:59.036
Am I in trouble?

11:00.106 --> 11:01.238
Yes, you're in trouble--

11:01.240 --> 11:03.541
you went to Wizarding World
without me!

11:03.543 --> 11:05.543
Wait, what just happened?

11:05.545 --> 11:06.711
You know

11:06.713 --> 11:08.579
I've been wanting to go.

11:08.581 --> 11:10.815
Sheldon, do you
really want to argue with me

11:10.817 --> 11:12.450
on my birthday?

11:12.452 --> 11:14.885
Oh, you're right.

11:14.887 --> 11:16.821
I'm sorry.

11:18.891 --> 11:21.559
Ooh. Happy birthday to me.

11:26.065 --> 11:28.466
Hello...

11:30.436 --> 11:33.104
Is this about the baby?

11:33.106 --> 11:36.073
No. People just keep
kicking me out everywhere I go.

11:36.075 --> 11:38.175
Good. Then you're used to this.

11:39.445 --> 11:40.511
Hey, Bernadette's water broke!

11:40.513 --> 11:42.146
Come on! Everyone
to the hospital!

11:42.148 --> 11:44.715
You have got to be kidding me!

11:46.000 --> 11:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:53.434 --> 11:55.834
Just try to relax.
We'll be there any minute.

11:56.243 --> 11:57.811
Stuart, stop driving
like an old man.

11:57.812 --> 11:59.311
Speed it up a little.

11:59.313 --> 12:01.047
I'm not an old man!

12:01.049 --> 12:03.215
I just can't see at night.

12:04.285 --> 12:05.951
Here comes another one.

12:05.953 --> 12:08.954
Hey, Squinty,
the gas pedal's on the right!

12:08.956 --> 12:10.856
All right, hang on.

12:10.858 --> 12:13.659
If you see any pedestrians,
just call 'em out.

12:17.365 --> 12:20.032
Howard and Bernadette's kid
might be born on your birthday.

12:20.034 --> 12:21.367
How cool is that?

12:21.369 --> 12:23.536
Yeah, but I thought this
baby was supposed to ruin

12:23.538 --> 12:25.538
<i>their</i> sex life, not mine.

12:25.540 --> 12:27.239
This is not how

12:27.241 --> 12:30.009
I imagined this day going--
I should be with them right now.

12:30.011 --> 12:32.111
Well, it <i>is</i>
their child.

12:32.113 --> 12:33.345
I know that.

12:33.347 --> 12:35.247
But to be fair,
I've spent nine months

12:35.249 --> 12:37.550
helping Bernadette
get ready for this baby.

12:37.552 --> 12:40.352
And Howard spent five minutes
conceiving it.

12:40.354 --> 12:42.588
And I'm being generous.

12:43.624 --> 12:45.357
Five minutes?

12:45.359 --> 12:48.394
We must be doing it wrong.
It took us hours.

12:52.100 --> 12:53.899
And-and the worst part is

12:53.901 --> 12:57.536
that they kicked <i>me</i> out
and let Stuart stay.

12:57.538 --> 13:00.172
I understand, but this is
a special day for them.

13:00.174 --> 13:02.308
Can you just try and let it go?

13:02.310 --> 13:03.642
She's right.

13:03.644 --> 13:06.846
You know, I just learned Amy
went to a theme park without me,

13:06.848 --> 13:08.714
but I'm not going
to ruin her birthday.

13:08.716 --> 13:11.517
I'll wait, and ruin
24 individual hours

13:11.519 --> 13:13.819
sprinkled
throughout the year.

13:15.957 --> 13:17.723
Boop.

13:21.395 --> 13:24.530
Deep breaths,
slow breaths.

13:24.532 --> 13:27.700
I'm so thirsty.
Give me more ice chips.

13:32.807 --> 13:36.675
Sorry. I... thought
these were room ice chips.

13:37.912 --> 13:39.912
I'll go get some more.

13:39.914 --> 13:41.781
Uh, Stuart, while
you're out there,

13:41.783 --> 13:43.549
don't come back.

13:43.551 --> 13:45.384
Okay.

13:47.855 --> 13:51.724
So, what are we gonna
name this kid?

13:51.726 --> 13:53.592
Now that we know
she's a girl,

13:53.594 --> 13:57.096
it kind of ruins my plan
for Wally Wolowitz.

13:58.366 --> 14:00.499
Could name her
after your mom.

14:00.501 --> 14:01.634
Debbie?

14:01.636 --> 14:03.102
No.

14:03.104 --> 14:04.904
She hated that name.

14:04.906 --> 14:06.505
Did she have a middle name?

14:06.507 --> 14:08.174
Melvina.

14:09.477 --> 14:12.578
Let's keep thinking.

14:12.580 --> 14:15.281
Mm.
Ah.

14:15.283 --> 14:17.817
It sucks that
she's not here.

14:17.819 --> 14:19.418
I know.

14:19.420 --> 14:20.719
Hm.

14:20.721 --> 14:23.956
She would've been
the best grandma.

14:23.958 --> 14:26.091
She did always have candy
in her pocket.

14:26.093 --> 14:27.893
Yeah.

14:27.895 --> 14:30.563
I was 20 years old
before I figured out

14:30.565 --> 14:33.833
Tootsie Rolls weren't
naturally warm.

14:34.969 --> 14:37.536
I didn't know her
five minutes and she asked,

14:37.538 --> 14:41.674
“Are you a Milky Way
or a Snickers girl?”

14:41.676 --> 14:45.578
Thank God you answered right,
we wouldn't be here today.

14:48.015 --> 14:49.982
It's hard to believe
Howard's having a kid.

14:49.984 --> 14:51.317
Yeah.

14:51.319 --> 14:53.385
Penny, you're the one who
introduced him to Bernie.

14:53.387 --> 14:55.888
How many times do I have
to say I'm sorry?

14:57.091 --> 14:59.358
It's not just Howard
and Bernadette. I mean,

14:59.360 --> 15:01.093
look how far
we've all come.

15:01.095 --> 15:02.027
Hmm.
Hmm.

15:02.029 --> 15:03.295
You two got married.

15:03.297 --> 15:05.831
Sheldon and I
are living together.

15:05.833 --> 15:08.400
But if my mom asks,
we have bunk beds.

15:10.171 --> 15:12.471
Penny was a struggling
actress when we met,

15:12.473 --> 15:14.707
and now she's a successful
pharmaceutical rep.

15:14.709 --> 15:17.309
Okay, you don't have to say
“struggling” every time.

15:17.311 --> 15:19.979
You can just say “actress.”

15:19.981 --> 15:21.881
Howard went to space.

15:21.883 --> 15:24.149
Bernadette got
her doctorate.

15:24.151 --> 15:26.352
Sheldon, Howard and I are
working with the government

15:26.354 --> 15:28.020
on our quantum gyroscope.

15:28.022 --> 15:30.289
We've all come a long way.

15:30.291 --> 15:31.824
There's a lot
to be proud of.

15:33.261 --> 15:36.929
For God's sake, just drive in
the knife, why don't you!

15:38.833 --> 15:40.900
What's your problem?
Well, you're all thinking

15:40.902 --> 15:44.270
that I'm the only one who
hasn't done anything worthwhile.

15:44.272 --> 15:45.738
I was not thinking it.

15:45.740 --> 15:49.975
Although, now that
you point it out, it is undeniable.

15:49.977 --> 15:51.710
Raj, if it's
any consolation,

15:51.712 --> 15:54.747
I'm no better off than
I was ten years ago.

15:54.749 --> 15:57.283
Oh, yay!

15:57.285 --> 15:59.585
I have a doctorate
in astrophysics

15:59.587 --> 16:01.153
and I'm every bit as awesome

16:01.155 --> 16:03.822
as the pasty-faced owner
of a comic book store!

16:03.824 --> 16:06.392
Raj! Show some compassion.

16:06.394 --> 16:09.428
Those are things that
we think but don't say.

16:13.100 --> 16:14.733
Excuse me.

16:16.470 --> 16:17.770
Sorry, Stuart.

16:17.772 --> 16:20.205
Hey, I'm in a hospital
and I'm not the patient.

16:20.207 --> 16:22.041
I'm fine.

16:23.177 --> 16:24.643
Come on, Bernie, breathe.

16:24.645 --> 16:26.712
Remember what you learned
in birthing class.

16:26.714 --> 16:28.747
I remember thinking,
“This is stupid”"

16:28.749 --> 16:31.550
and I was right!

16:31.552 --> 16:33.218
Do you want me
to get the nurse?

16:33.220 --> 16:36.088
No! If one more person puts
their fingers near my uterus,

16:36.090 --> 16:39.325
I'm gonna cross my legs
and snap 'em off!

16:43.597 --> 16:46.165
I've come to peace with my
relationship with my parents.

16:46.167 --> 16:48.534
That was a big milestone for me.

16:48.536 --> 16:50.436
Oh, speaking of personal growth,

16:50.438 --> 16:53.939
I recently tried eating
Swiss chard.

16:55.242 --> 16:59.845
You know, I didn't swallow it,
but Amy said it counted.

17:00.815 --> 17:03.582
Hey.
Hey.

17:07.521 --> 17:09.288
Still a loser or
did you turn things around

17:09.290 --> 17:11.457
while you were gone?

17:13.027 --> 17:14.259
You know, Raj, honey,

17:14.261 --> 17:16.028
you're being
too hard on yourself.

17:16.030 --> 17:18.030
When I first met you,
you couldn't even talk to women.

17:18.031 --> 17:19.932
I mean, you couldn't even talk
if one was in the room.

17:19.934 --> 17:21.333
Oh, great, now I can say

17:21.335 --> 17:24.069
things like “I can't believe
you're breaking up with me.”

17:24.070 --> 17:27.039
“Why are you breaking up
with me?”

17:27.040 --> 17:30.142
“Yes, I'll still help you move”"

17:30.144 --> 17:32.411
Anyone else want to try?

17:32.413 --> 17:34.947
Uh, yeah, I got something.

17:34.949 --> 17:36.215
Raj,

17:36.217 --> 17:39.318
not everybody
could be a dog owner.

17:40.421 --> 17:44.723
Oh, what? Did your doggie
break up with you too?

17:45.793 --> 17:48.660
Hey, I bought M&Ms
at the vending machine

17:48.662 --> 17:49.828
and two bags came out.

17:49.830 --> 17:51.630
I bought the first one,

17:51.632 --> 17:54.099
it didn't fall.

17:54.101 --> 17:57.002
Here.

17:59.073 --> 18:01.440
She's here, the baby's here!

18:01.442 --> 18:03.742
- Oh! Oh.
- Congratulations!

18:03.744 --> 18:05.077
How's Bernadette?

18:05.079 --> 18:06.512
Tired, but great.

18:06.514 --> 18:07.679
They're both great.

18:07.681 --> 18:09.014
Does the baby have a name yet?

18:09.016 --> 18:11.483
We have named her Halley.

18:11.485 --> 18:13.085
- Oh!
- Oh, like Halley's comet.

18:13.087 --> 18:14.119
Exactly.

18:14.121 --> 18:15.754
Also like the comet,
Bernadette said

18:15.756 --> 18:19.625
she's not gonna have sex
with me for another 75 years.

18:19.627 --> 18:23.095
That's not a real thing,
he's just joking.

18:23.097 --> 18:24.530
I'm gonna get back.

18:24.532 --> 18:26.865
Thank you for staying up,
I can't wait for Halley to meet

18:26.867 --> 18:28.033
her new aunts and uncles

18:28.035 --> 18:30.335
and godfather.

18:30.337 --> 18:32.271
Really?

18:32.273 --> 18:34.406
Of course.

18:34.408 --> 18:35.707
You hear that, Stuart?!

18:35.709 --> 18:38.877
I've got a dog and a godchild,
you have nothing!

18:45.419 --> 18:48.487
Oh, look at all the babies!

18:48.489 --> 18:50.789
Some will be successful,

18:50.791 --> 18:54.960
some may be homeless.

18:54.962 --> 18:57.830
It's fun to think about.

18:59.567 --> 19:01.333
I wonder which one's Halley.

19:01.335 --> 19:03.135
Kind of hard to see the names.

19:03.137 --> 19:05.571
Mm, that one kind of
looks like Bernadette.

19:05.573 --> 19:07.172
They all look the same to me.

19:07.174 --> 19:08.340
Guys,

19:08.342 --> 19:09.675
she's my goddaughter,

19:09.677 --> 19:12.344
I think I'll know
when I see her.

19:22.679 --> 19:24.846
That one.

19:33.255 --> 19:35.156
Well, that was quite a day.

19:35.157 --> 19:37.223
It was.

19:37.225 --> 19:38.925
Bernadette had her baby,

19:38.927 --> 19:40.860
I made it to Wizarding World,

19:40.862 --> 19:42.629
and now it is time to complete

19:42.631 --> 19:44.864
your birthday celebration.

19:44.866 --> 19:46.032
<i>Hankius</i>

19:46.034 --> 19:49.703
<i>pankius.</i>

19:49.705 --> 19:52.305
I was afraid you'd be too tired.

19:52.307 --> 19:55.141
Amy, I just saw a magic train

19:55.143 --> 19:58.878
and reported somebody
for cutting the line.

20:00.048 --> 20:02.615
If that's not foreplay,
I don't know what is.
