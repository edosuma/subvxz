WEBVTT

02:17.156 --> 02:18.291
I appreciate it.

02:18.324 --> 02:20.326
I know that your
relatives are scattered.

02:20.360 --> 02:22.462
We'd be happy to come back.

02:22.494 --> 02:23.863
Are you sure
you'll be all right?

02:23.896 --> 02:26.466
Yes. I'll be fine. Thank you.

02:26.498 --> 02:30.069
I fly back to Detroit tonight.
I'll get in late,

02:30.103 --> 02:32.838
but call me if you
need to. Anytime.

02:32.872 --> 02:35.308
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I'll be okay.

02:35.341 --> 02:38.444
Okay. I know you will.
Take care, sweetheart.

02:38.478 --> 02:40.846
I will. Bye.

04:53.913 --> 04:55.081
<i>So, raise your hand</i>

04:55.114 --> 04:58.017
<i>if you have better taste
in music than the groom.</i>

04:58.050 --> 05:00.319
<i>Do I see any hands?</i>

05:00.353 --> 05:01.988
<i>All right, yeah, I see a few.</i>

10:28.147 --> 10:30.282
What we're looking
at here are the eoct scores.

10:30.316 --> 10:32.518
Now, I'm gonna pick on
10th grade just a little bit

10:32.551 --> 10:35.154
because you'll see
the biggest difference there.

10:35.187 --> 10:38.557
The yellow line, the mustardy
one, that's two years ago.

10:38.591 --> 10:40.226
The blue is last year.

10:40.259 --> 10:42.495
The pink is this year.

10:44.797 --> 10:46.332
Beth is here.

10:47.633 --> 10:49.702
Give her space.

10:49.735 --> 10:53.372
The pink is this year.
So, what happened?

10:53.405 --> 10:54.908
Teacher-student ratio.

10:54.941 --> 10:58.611
I know, but class sizes
are what they are. It's statewide.

10:58.644 --> 11:01.480
We can't play the blame game
when we're pulling up the rear...

11:01.514 --> 11:02.781
Sorry.

11:04.049 --> 11:05.684
- Hey.
- Hi.

11:05.718 --> 11:09.655
I don't think you had to come.
No one would blame you.

11:09.688 --> 11:11.190
I still have grades to enter.

11:11.223 --> 11:14.059
I'd have done that for you.
All you had to do is ask.

11:14.093 --> 11:15.194
It's all right.

11:15.227 --> 11:17.964
It gives me something to do.
For now, anyway.

11:17.998 --> 11:19.265
We don't wanna be that school.

11:19.298 --> 11:20.466
You holdin' up?

11:20.499 --> 11:22.034
I don't want
to be that principal.

11:22.067 --> 11:24.436
Yeah, I'm fine.

11:24.470 --> 11:26.873
Just didn't really
sleep well last night.

11:26.907 --> 11:29.408
Can't believe you slept at all.
Especially there.

11:29.441 --> 11:31.544
We got to show up for them.

11:31.577 --> 11:33.546
Okay. I promised to give you all

11:33.579 --> 11:35.614
a 10-minute break,
so let's go ahead and take that.

11:35.648 --> 11:38.317
Go potty, stretch your legs.
There are more donuts in the back,

11:38.350 --> 11:41.220
courtesy of mountville baptist
church, so get you some,

11:41.253 --> 11:43.622
and be back by 8:40 though,
on the dot-ish.

12:16.589 --> 12:18.490
Mrs. Parchin?

12:19.859 --> 12:21.193
Hi.

12:29.335 --> 12:30.469
Sorry. I was just...

12:30.502 --> 12:32.504
Excuse me.
I tried to knock, but...

12:32.538 --> 12:34.239
We met before.

12:34.273 --> 12:36.175
Um, I'm hunter's mom.

12:37.109 --> 12:39.012
- Hunter...
- McLaughlin.

12:39.045 --> 12:40.179
He has you second period.

12:40.212 --> 12:42.815
I'm Becky McLaughlin.
It was a few months ago.

12:42.848 --> 12:43.883
Right. Of course.

12:43.917 --> 12:46.785
I... I have so many hunters
this year.

12:46.819 --> 12:49.188
- Oh. How many?
- Hmm?

12:49.221 --> 12:51.590
Students named hunter
do you have?

12:51.624 --> 12:53.559
Mm... three.

12:53.592 --> 12:56.528
Please, have a seat.

13:01.266 --> 13:04.269
I'm sure you know why I'm here.

13:06.705 --> 13:08.807
I checked the website.

13:08.841 --> 13:10.910
Hunter got a c in speech.

13:11.810 --> 13:14.246
Oh, right. I think so.

13:14.279 --> 13:15.882
Uh... let me check.

13:15.915 --> 13:17.850
- But that's what it said.
- Mm-hmm.

13:18.885 --> 13:20.719
Let me see here.

13:20.753 --> 13:23.455
Uh... right, yes.

13:23.489 --> 13:26.492
It looks like he didn't do
his last presentation.

13:26.525 --> 13:28.794
He said that you told him
he could make that up.

13:28.827 --> 13:29.695
I did.

13:29.728 --> 13:32.264
Yeah. He, uh... He didn't.

13:32.297 --> 13:34.833
He said he came in
last Thursday.

13:34.868 --> 13:36.970
That was the last day of school.

13:37.003 --> 13:39.238
He said that you weren't here.

13:39.271 --> 13:43.877
Yes, I was out for a few days.
It was a personal matter.

13:43.910 --> 13:48.213
Well, he told me he was out the
day you presented those projects.

13:48.247 --> 13:50.749
We all have personal matters
to deal with sometimes.

13:52.351 --> 13:54.386
Okay. Uh...

13:54.420 --> 13:56.956
You know what?
Let's just excuse him

13:56.990 --> 13:58.757
from that assignment.

13:58.791 --> 13:59.825
Uh...

13:59.859 --> 14:01.360
There. B.

14:01.393 --> 14:05.131
That's not what I wanted.

14:05.165 --> 14:07.499
Then, uh, what did you want?

14:08.034 --> 14:09.301
Excuse me?

14:09.334 --> 14:11.370
When you came in here,
what did you want?

14:11.403 --> 14:13.338
I want to know why my son...

14:13.372 --> 14:16.408
My husband shot himself
in the head last Thursday.

14:20.046 --> 14:21.915
I hadn't heard.

14:22.982 --> 14:25.718
No, because
it's a personal matter.

14:25.751 --> 14:27.720
So, yeah.

14:27.753 --> 14:30.489
Yeah. If you wanna know,

14:30.522 --> 14:31.858
he took the boat out
on the lake.

14:31.891 --> 14:34.994
He took a handgun that I
didn't even know that we owned.

14:35.028 --> 14:38.564
And pow! Right in the mouth.

14:38.597 --> 14:40.566
So, which hunter got what grade

14:40.599 --> 14:44.670
on what high school elective
speech class assignment,

14:45.771 --> 14:48.340
it really doesn't matter
to me right now.

14:48.373 --> 14:52.511
So, you want a b, you got a b.

14:53.445 --> 14:55.748
I... I apologize.

14:55.781 --> 14:57.083
Oh, you want an a?

14:57.117 --> 14:58.918
All right. Ta-da!

14:59.318 --> 15:01.121
A b is fine.

15:01.154 --> 15:02.654
B it is.

15:05.691 --> 15:07.726
Anything else I can do for you?

15:08.194 --> 15:09.561
No.

15:10.230 --> 15:11.931
Thank you.

15:17.070 --> 15:18.737
I'm so sorry for your loss.

16:12.258 --> 16:15.727
- Oh. Hey, Mel.
- Hey.

16:15.761 --> 16:17.096
The sky was looking
a little mean.

16:17.130 --> 16:19.398
I went ahead and covered the boat for
you, just in case.

16:19.431 --> 16:20.632
You didn't have to do that.

16:20.666 --> 16:22.869
Ah, that's a goddamn lie
if I've ever heard one.

16:22.902 --> 16:25.771
Just paying it back, that's all.

16:25.804 --> 16:29.008
You and Owen were a couple
godsends when Shelly passed.

16:29.042 --> 16:30.409
Thank you.

16:35.215 --> 16:37.317
You want me to haul
that thing away?

16:37.349 --> 16:40.053
You just say the word.

16:40.086 --> 16:42.021
It's okay.
I think I'll leave it.

16:42.055 --> 16:44.257
Sell it with the house.

16:44.290 --> 16:46.025
You thinking about selling?

16:46.993 --> 16:48.527
Maybe.

16:48.560 --> 16:51.597
I mean, he built it,
so I'd hate to leave it, but...

16:52.866 --> 16:54.499
Yeah.

16:54.533 --> 16:57.502
It's peaceful out here,
but it is lonely.

16:59.939 --> 17:03.343
Hey, Mel, were you, uh,
shooting this morning

17:03.375 --> 17:05.711
around 7:30 or so?

17:05.743 --> 17:08.080
Didn't hear anything?
There was a gunshot.

17:08.114 --> 17:10.848
I just figured with
the weather getting warmer

17:10.884 --> 17:12.886
and snakes and all...

17:12.919 --> 17:14.354
I see a copperhead
near the house,

17:14.386 --> 17:16.106
I'm sure gonna shoot it,
but I didn't today.

17:16.256 --> 17:17.422
Right.

17:17.455 --> 17:20.525
You hear it again,
just give me a shout, okay?

17:20.559 --> 17:22.527
- Okay, I will.
- Okay.

17:22.560 --> 17:24.429
- I'm gonna get back.
- Mm-hmm.

17:32.171 --> 17:36.575
<i>So, this is going to be
the office down here,</i>

17:36.608 --> 17:38.777
<i>and over here
will be the kitchen.</i>

17:38.810 --> 17:41.180
<i>Or maybe it's here.</i>

17:41.214 --> 17:44.284
<i>And then...
And then over here we have,</i>

17:44.317 --> 17:45.584
<i>uh...</i>

17:45.617 --> 17:49.421
<i>biceps. Lots of biceps.</i>

17:50.056 --> 17:51.757
<i>So, that is the husband.</i>

17:51.790 --> 17:53.960
<i>Oh, hey, Owen!
How are you doing?</i>

17:53.993 --> 17:55.995
<i>Are you working?</i>

17:56.029 --> 17:58.530
<i>You know that we're paying
people to do that, right?</i>

17:58.563 --> 18:00.266
<i>You don't have to
do it all yourself.</i>

18:00.300 --> 18:01.667
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

18:01.700 --> 18:03.769
<i>No, no, don't worry,
I'm not actually filming.</i>

18:03.802 --> 18:05.537
<i>- Mm-hmm?
- Mm-hmm.</i>

18:05.570 --> 18:07.506
<i>Well, unless you want me to.</i>

18:08.674 --> 18:09.976
<i>Let me check.</i>

18:10.009 --> 18:11.411
<i>No. Stop.</i>

18:11.443 --> 18:13.146
<i>Come here.</i>

23:10.309 --> 23:12.245
Who is this?

23:17.183 --> 23:18.584
<i>Beth...</i>

23:18.618 --> 23:20.987
Owen? Is...

23:22.521 --> 23:23.822
<i>I know that you can...</i>

23:23.856 --> 23:27.093
I can't hear you. I can't...

23:27.759 --> 23:30.229
<i>Yes, you can.</i>

23:30.263 --> 23:32.431
<i>Look out the window.</i>

26:17.763 --> 26:19.565
What am I looking at?

26:19.598 --> 26:21.868
You tell me.

26:21.902 --> 26:24.804
It's a picture of you.

26:24.837 --> 26:25.872
Is it?

26:25.906 --> 26:27.373
Yeah.

26:27.406 --> 26:30.042
I mean, nice blouse.

26:33.512 --> 26:34.647
Look... look closer.

26:36.982 --> 26:38.250
Is that me?

26:38.284 --> 26:40.753
Yeah, I think so.
I mean, who else would it be?

26:40.786 --> 26:42.889
That's what I want to know.

26:42.923 --> 26:45.157
Well, it's either you
or a woman who looks,

26:45.191 --> 26:47.259
like, a lot like you.

26:47.293 --> 26:50.229
Sweetie, I think that's you.

26:50.262 --> 26:53.532
Nice blouse, right?
I don't have one like that.

26:53.566 --> 26:55.201
God, Beth.

26:55.234 --> 26:57.369
Don't do this to yourself.

26:57.904 --> 27:00.039
It's you, okay?

27:00.072 --> 27:02.775
And if it's not you,
then, believe me,

27:02.808 --> 27:05.086
there are far worse things to
find on your husband's phone

27:05.110 --> 27:08.247
than fully clothed women
who look exactly like you.

27:08.280 --> 27:11.984
Mm. Yeah, well,
I guess I was his type.

27:12.017 --> 27:14.620
Please. Owen loved you.

27:14.653 --> 27:17.189
You. He worshipped you.

27:17.223 --> 27:18.290
I...

27:18.324 --> 27:19.568
I mean, from everything
you told me,

27:19.592 --> 27:22.261
you didn't really give him
any reason to roam.

27:22.294 --> 27:25.130
I mean, how do you know he even
took those pictures anyway?

27:25.164 --> 27:27.766
He's not here to defend
himself or explain.

27:29.435 --> 27:31.246
Look, a bunch of us are
going out tonight drinking.

27:31.270 --> 27:33.305
The whole department.
Well, not Clark, obviously,

27:33.339 --> 27:37.243
but you should come.
Get your mind off things.

27:37.276 --> 27:38.444
We'll see.

27:40.212 --> 27:42.448
Why were you going through
his phone anyway?

27:44.617 --> 27:45.784
Shit.

27:46.552 --> 27:47.954
Sorry.

27:47.988 --> 27:50.589
That was... that was
a really fucking stupid,

27:50.623 --> 27:52.358
insensitive thing to say.

27:55.027 --> 27:56.562
I'm sorry.

27:57.263 --> 27:59.298
I didn't think we had secrets.

28:01.834 --> 28:04.103
Everybody has secrets.

28:04.136 --> 28:05.571
Don't let it weigh on you.

28:06.006 --> 28:07.606
Just...

28:07.640 --> 28:09.708
Just remember your Owen.

28:09.742 --> 28:12.378
Who you fell in love with.

28:12.411 --> 28:15.681
Because whatever else he was,
he was that, too.

28:21.086 --> 28:22.121
<i>What's her name?</i>

28:22.154 --> 28:23.422
Maggie Monroe.

28:23.455 --> 28:25.224
Oh, she'd be my best customer.

28:25.257 --> 28:28.060
She told me I don't have a
knack for teaching anyway.

28:28.093 --> 28:29.295
And she'd know

28:29.328 --> 28:31.764
'cause she's an expert
on many things.

28:31.797 --> 28:33.532
Jesus Christ.

28:33.566 --> 28:36.702
So, are we going
to read the book she gave us?

28:36.735 --> 28:39.906
Fuck, no. I don't need
300 pages to tell me

28:39.940 --> 28:42.474
how to "engage and inspire"
my students.

28:42.508 --> 28:45.912
Yeah, just let them stand up
on their desks or whatever.

28:45.946 --> 28:47.780
Change their lives.

28:50.984 --> 28:52.318
You okay, b?

28:56.221 --> 28:58.424
Do you guys believe in ghosts?

29:00.326 --> 29:02.561
Uh... Ghosts, like, how?

29:04.931 --> 29:07.132
I do. I believe.

29:07.166 --> 29:08.677
- Really?
- Well, I mean, I don't not believe.

29:08.701 --> 29:11.170
I think there's something
in my house.

29:11.905 --> 29:14.273
Like a... a presence.

29:14.807 --> 29:15.976
No way.

29:16.009 --> 29:17.309
I mean, I don't know.

29:17.343 --> 29:19.378
I feel like there's something.

29:19.411 --> 29:23.415
Like there's something
watching me.

29:24.850 --> 29:27.119
And all this weird stuff.

29:27.152 --> 29:29.655
I'm having these dreams.

29:29.688 --> 29:31.490
I mean, it feels like
they're dreams.

29:31.523 --> 29:33.101
They feel real though
when they're happening.

29:33.125 --> 29:34.560
Like sleep paralysis?

29:35.394 --> 29:36.328
No.

29:36.362 --> 29:37.639
Do you know
what sleep paralysis is?

29:37.663 --> 29:39.465
Yes, Gary, I know
what sleep paralysis is.

29:39.498 --> 29:40.766
I don't.

29:40.799 --> 29:43.402
It's when your mind's
awake, but your body's not, right?

29:43.435 --> 29:44.971
Did you guys see
that documentary on...

29:45.005 --> 29:46.639
I had this buddy
in school who had it.

29:46.672 --> 29:49.150
It's pretty common to feel like there's
someone else in the room with you

29:49.174 --> 29:50.676
when you're having an episode.

29:50.709 --> 29:52.311
Like a hostile presence.

29:52.344 --> 29:53.913
What about the opposite?

29:53.947 --> 29:55.115
Like a friendly presence?

29:55.147 --> 29:57.027
No. When your body's awake,
but your mind isn't.

29:58.051 --> 30:00.053
But isn't that
just sleepwalking?

30:00.086 --> 30:02.254
Sure. Sleepwalking.

30:02.287 --> 30:03.857
Could that be contagious?

30:03.890 --> 30:05.724
No. Why?

30:05.758 --> 30:07.292
Owen used to sleepwalk.

30:08.094 --> 30:10.562
I remember that.

30:10.596 --> 30:13.332
A year or two after he built the
house, it just started.

30:13.365 --> 30:14.633
Now you're doing it?

30:14.667 --> 30:15.734
Yeah.

30:15.768 --> 30:16.802
That's weird.

30:21.007 --> 30:22.675
How long were you married?

30:22.708 --> 30:23.943
Uh... oh.

30:26.211 --> 30:27.413
Let me do the math.

30:28.814 --> 30:30.549
Fourteen years.

30:30.582 --> 30:33.585
This next one,
this next one would have been 15.

30:33.619 --> 30:34.753
Wow.

30:34.787 --> 30:36.056
You were married young.

30:36.089 --> 30:38.257
Little bit. Little bit.

30:38.290 --> 30:40.359
I mean, you spend so much time

30:40.392 --> 30:42.628
in the same space with someone,

30:42.661 --> 30:44.864
it's gonna feel like
they're there.

30:44.898 --> 30:46.331
Even when they're not.

30:46.365 --> 30:48.101
But who knows, right?
I mean, who's to say

30:48.134 --> 30:49.368
what happens once we

30:49.401 --> 30:52.072
"shuffle off this mortal coil,
what dreams may come"?

30:52.105 --> 30:53.940
No. No Shakespeare
until next fall.

30:53.973 --> 30:57.409
Are you really gonna cheer me
up with the suicide soliloquy?

30:58.111 --> 31:00.312
Fuck. Oh, my god.

31:00.345 --> 31:02.949
Oh, my god, I didn't...
I'm so sorry.

31:05.051 --> 31:06.853
I'm joking.

31:06.886 --> 31:08.387
I'm joking.

31:10.522 --> 31:11.834
You shouldn't be
joking about that.

31:11.858 --> 31:12.892
Heather...

31:12.926 --> 31:14.493
Oh...

31:14.526 --> 31:18.497
Did you seriously not know
that anything was wrong?

31:18.530 --> 31:19.798
Gary! Jesus, you guys...

31:19.832 --> 31:20.867
No, I don't mind.

31:20.900 --> 31:22.869
No, I didn't know.

31:22.902 --> 31:25.972
I'm the one who struggled
with that stuff. Depression.

31:26.005 --> 31:27.840
Dark thoughts.

31:28.607 --> 31:30.910
He's the one that
kept them at bay.

31:31.710 --> 31:32.879
Maybe it got to him.

31:32.912 --> 31:37.583
I don't know.
Maybe I infected him with my bullshit.

31:37.616 --> 31:38.784
No, no. It...

31:38.817 --> 31:40.920
- It doesn't work like that.
- No?

31:47.793 --> 31:49.095
Did he leave a note?

31:49.129 --> 31:50.462
Okay.

31:50.496 --> 31:52.765
- I'm sorry.
- She wants to talk about it.

31:52.798 --> 31:54.934
I think we're done
with this conversation.

31:54.968 --> 31:56.169
He did.

31:56.202 --> 31:57.469
Beth...

32:00.140 --> 32:01.707
He did.

32:01.740 --> 32:02.741
God.

32:13.352 --> 32:15.621
You keep it in your purse?

32:18.423 --> 32:20.026
Okay.

32:31.171 --> 32:32.771
"You were right."

32:34.174 --> 32:36.508
"There is nothing."

32:38.410 --> 32:40.512
"Nothing is after you."

32:43.950 --> 32:45.651
"You're safe now."

32:48.821 --> 32:49.822
That's it.

32:50.957 --> 32:51.991
That's it?

32:52.025 --> 32:53.226
That's it.

32:53.259 --> 32:57.163
No "xoxo, your loving husband."

32:57.197 --> 32:58.898
Nothing.

32:58.932 --> 33:00.300
What does that mean?

33:00.332 --> 33:01.834
Not a clue. Not a fucking clue.

33:01.868 --> 33:03.769
Other than I was living
with a crazy person

33:03.802 --> 33:04.803
and didn't know it.

33:04.837 --> 33:06.672
Makes you wonder though,
doesn't it?

33:06.705 --> 33:08.740
What else didn't I know?

33:09.309 --> 33:10.910
I want to know.

33:10.944 --> 33:13.445
Okay. I think that it's
time we get you home.

33:13.478 --> 33:17.616
Sure. I mean,
I wouldn't wanna keep him waiting.

33:18.251 --> 33:19.953
Okay.

33:19.986 --> 33:21.020
Let's go.

33:21.054 --> 33:22.588
Okay, fine, let's go.

33:22.621 --> 33:24.656
Good night, guys. Thank you.

33:24.690 --> 33:27.359
- Okay.
- Let's go. I got you.

33:37.569 --> 33:40.273
Wow, you've really made
some progress on the place.

33:40.306 --> 33:41.506
Mm-hmm.

33:44.277 --> 33:45.477
You want a Brandy?

33:45.510 --> 33:48.647
No, Beth. I don't want a Brandy.

33:48.680 --> 33:51.084
- And I don't want you to have one either.
- Okay.

33:52.085 --> 33:53.719
I don't even like it that much.

33:53.752 --> 33:55.855
Haven't acquired the taste.

34:00.492 --> 34:03.096
Come on, upstairs with you.

34:03.129 --> 34:06.431
No. I'm sleeping here.

34:09.467 --> 34:11.971
Okay. Do you want me to stay?

34:12.571 --> 34:16.541
Mm-mm. You've got kids.

34:16.574 --> 34:19.012
It's fine. I could just...

34:20.411 --> 34:22.358
I can call Bob.
I told him I was gonna be out late.

34:22.382 --> 34:24.449
I could just call him and...

34:25.217 --> 34:26.985
No. Mm-mm.

34:29.355 --> 34:32.926
Well, you should come over soon.

34:32.958 --> 34:35.726
For dinner or something.
I'll get Bob to cook for us.

34:36.728 --> 34:40.233
I don't like you here
all by yourself.

34:49.708 --> 34:51.177
I lied.

34:55.315 --> 34:57.549
About the letter.

34:57.582 --> 35:01.720
You asshole! Oh, my god!

35:01.753 --> 35:05.258
Oh, my god, you totally has us going.
I thought that was real.

35:05.291 --> 35:06.960
Did you see Gary's face?

35:06.993 --> 35:08.094
It is real.

35:08.127 --> 35:10.629
I meant that I lied about
having no idea what it meant.

35:16.402 --> 35:17.937
You know, I...

35:17.971 --> 35:22.507
I died back in Tennessee.
Did I tell you that story?

35:23.742 --> 35:25.411
Mm-mm.

35:25.445 --> 35:27.046
Seventeen, high school.

35:27.713 --> 35:29.415
Friend was driving,

35:29.449 --> 35:33.052
and we flipped
over the side of a mountain.

35:35.355 --> 35:37.190
Pancaked.

35:39.058 --> 35:42.962
Lungs were crushed.
They had to airlift me out.

35:44.330 --> 35:47.799
Heart stopped.
Whole deal. Four minutes.

35:48.234 --> 35:49.902
Oh, my god.

35:51.304 --> 35:57.343
Afterward, when everyone would
ask me when they found out,

35:57.377 --> 36:01.047
like, "what was it like?
What did you see?"

36:03.950 --> 36:07.053
And I didn't want to disappoint
them, so I'd say...

36:08.787 --> 36:10.689
"I don't know.
I don't remember."

36:14.961 --> 36:16.628
But I remember.

36:17.497 --> 36:20.299
Owen was the only person
I ever told.

36:21.067 --> 36:22.969
There's nothing.

36:25.371 --> 36:29.008
What do you mean, "nothing"?

36:30.809 --> 36:32.879
I wish I could
tell you something.

36:32.912 --> 36:36.182
A light at the end
of the tunnel.

36:36.215 --> 36:38.184
There's just tunnel.

36:41.854 --> 36:45.757
If it's any consolation,
Owen was never convinced.

36:48.827 --> 36:53.299
Yeah, we agreed about
most things, but not that.

36:53.332 --> 36:56.701
Not what comes after.
He wanted to believe in a better place.

36:57.669 --> 37:00.206
And he almost
made me believe it, too.

37:02.508 --> 37:05.344
But you can't unknow
what you know.

37:07.779 --> 37:12.351
"You were right.
There is nothing."

37:14.454 --> 37:16.755
"Nothing is after you."

37:18.590 --> 37:20.193
"You're safe now."

37:23.129 --> 37:25.131
He told me I was right.

37:28.167 --> 37:30.036
Now I'm not so sure.

37:31.971 --> 37:36.675
He said you were safe.
Safe from what?

37:36.708 --> 37:39.278
I guess we'll never know,
will we, Claire?

37:42.747 --> 37:44.984
Do you really believe in ghosts?

37:45.017 --> 37:48.221
No. I was just being nice.

37:49.122 --> 37:50.890
Mm.

37:50.923 --> 37:55.228
You are. You're very, very nice.

37:57.864 --> 37:59.798
Sure you don't want me to stay?

38:01.633 --> 38:03.936
Maybe just till I go to sleep.

38:09.509 --> 38:11.944
<i>Beth.</i>

38:13.745 --> 38:15.615
<i>Beth. Wake up.</i>

38:15.647 --> 38:16.949
<i>The door.</i>

38:18.750 --> 38:21.320
<i>Beth, wake up.</i>

38:28.060 --> 38:29.661
Claire?

38:30.329 --> 38:31.830
<i>The door.</i>

38:37.937 --> 38:40.439
You wanna say something?
Talk to me!

39:28.521 --> 39:29.655
Hey!

39:31.290 --> 39:33.226
Hey! Hey!

39:36.028 --> 39:37.363
Hey!

39:50.509 --> 39:52.378
What?

39:58.417 --> 40:01.287
Wait! No! No!

40:14.667 --> 40:15.701
<i>The boat.</i>

40:15.735 --> 40:18.237
What did you say?

40:22.807 --> 40:24.010
<i>The boat.</i>

41:23.736 --> 41:25.404
Owen?

41:27.540 --> 41:29.075
Are you really here?

41:45.057 --> 41:46.926
If you're with me, show me.

42:05.511 --> 42:07.179
Is that really you?

44:30.055 --> 44:31.457
<i>It's a dream.</i>

44:33.826 --> 44:35.394
<i>You're dreaming.</i>

48:12.145 --> 48:13.779
Beth?

48:14.114 --> 48:15.414
Hey.

48:15.447 --> 48:18.450
What are you doing out here?
Taking a hike?

48:18.484 --> 48:22.088
Uh, no. No,
I'm just looking for something.

48:22.122 --> 48:23.555
Can I help?

48:23.589 --> 48:24.690
Uh-uh.

48:25.824 --> 48:27.693
What you looking for?

48:27.726 --> 48:29.261
Uh... a house.

48:30.096 --> 48:32.464
- A house?
- Mm-hmm.

48:32.498 --> 48:35.168
No houses out here.
It's all county forest land.

48:35.201 --> 48:36.936
Can't build on it.

48:38.905 --> 48:39.915
Right. I'm just being silly.

48:39.939 --> 48:43.642
I thought I saw something
last night, like a...

48:43.675 --> 48:46.880
Looked like a light
in a window, so...

48:47.713 --> 48:49.149
A house?

48:49.182 --> 48:50.482
Mm-hmm.

48:52.518 --> 48:55.387
Anyway, it's doing me good
to get some air.

48:55.420 --> 48:57.756
So, if you don't mind...

48:58.624 --> 49:00.359
As a matter of fact, I do.

49:01.928 --> 49:03.729
Sorry, what?

49:04.964 --> 49:07.033
You're not well, Beth.

49:07.066 --> 49:08.878
You've been through a lot lately.
More than you deserve.

49:08.902 --> 49:10.736
And for my own peace of
mind, if nothing else,

49:10.769 --> 49:15.607
I'd rather not have you tromping around
out here in the woods on your own.

49:15.641 --> 49:17.877
You should be with your
friends and family.

49:18.844 --> 49:20.479
Do you have anybody?

49:22.681 --> 49:25.919
Hey. How about
my place for lunch?

49:25.952 --> 49:29.289
- I'll make sandwiches.
- Mm-hmm.

49:29.321 --> 49:31.423
Yeah, that sounds nice.

49:32.457 --> 49:34.861
Maybe in a little while
though, okay?

51:31.911 --> 51:33.445
Anyone here?

53:03.802 --> 53:04.803
Mel?

53:08.408 --> 53:09.608
Mel?

53:10.209 --> 53:11.244
Hold on!

53:12.512 --> 53:13.845
Okay.

53:15.847 --> 53:18.051
- What the fuck is this?
- What?

53:18.084 --> 53:20.053
What the fuck is this?

53:20.086 --> 53:21.154
How should I know?

53:21.187 --> 53:22.797
Bullshit. You were trying to
keep me out of the woods.

53:22.821 --> 53:24.290
Because I'm worried about you.

53:24.323 --> 53:26.392
- What was he building?
- What?

53:26.426 --> 53:28.961
There is a house.
Our house. My house.

53:28.995 --> 53:30.897
Now, what the fuck
was he building?

53:30.930 --> 53:33.099
I don't know.
I never saw a house.

53:33.132 --> 53:34.867
I only saw him wandering
around out there

53:34.901 --> 53:36.701
in the middle of the night
from time to time.

53:36.735 --> 53:39.272
What? And you didn't tell me?

53:41.441 --> 53:43.342
He asked me not to.

53:45.644 --> 53:46.879
Mel.

53:46.913 --> 53:48.747
Look, Beth...

53:48.780 --> 53:51.250
I don't think you're equipped
to handle this right now.

53:52.919 --> 53:54.653
Oh.

53:56.055 --> 53:58.690
Tell me everything
that you know.

54:03.628 --> 54:05.697
I caught him once.

54:07.366 --> 54:09.701
Like I caught you this morning.

54:09.734 --> 54:12.939
Taking that same route
around the lake.

54:17.376 --> 54:19.312
He had a woman with him.

54:20.880 --> 54:24.917
I thought it was you, so I called
out, and when she turned...

54:25.451 --> 54:26.486
It wasn't.

54:26.519 --> 54:27.786
No.

54:28.855 --> 54:30.789
He came by that night.

54:30.822 --> 54:33.493
Pounding at my door. Late.

54:33.526 --> 54:35.394
In a real bad way.

54:35.428 --> 54:39.298
Alcohol on his breath. Mud on his
hands and clothes, like he'd fallen.

54:40.500 --> 54:42.602
And I know how it sounds now,

54:42.634 --> 54:45.704
but I believed
every word he said.

54:45.737 --> 54:48.074
And? What did he say?

54:48.807 --> 54:51.010
That he had urges.

54:53.179 --> 54:55.214
Shameful urges...

54:57.049 --> 55:00.186
That he was rightfully ashamed
of, that he was trying to shake.

55:01.120 --> 55:04.756
Said he'd found a way
to keep them at bay.

55:05.358 --> 55:09.462
What kind of urges?

55:09.495 --> 55:12.265
You'll forgive me if I
didn't feel the need to ask.

55:14.333 --> 55:18.404
Look. Don't think I haven't
wrestled with this, okay?

55:18.437 --> 55:19.972
But I swear on Shelly's grave

55:20.006 --> 55:22.841
that I never saw anything
like that again. Ever.

55:22.875 --> 55:24.911
I wanted to tell you
so many times...

55:28.948 --> 55:31.050
But he just seemed
good after that.

55:31.083 --> 55:34.253
You both seemed so good.

55:34.287 --> 55:36.055
Well, I guess you were wrong.

55:36.088 --> 55:37.523
He left a hole in your life

55:37.557 --> 55:40.326
and you're desperate to fill it.
That's what this is.

55:42.028 --> 55:43.996
Look, if...

55:47.200 --> 55:52.004
All I can say is that,
if I'm allowed to say anything,

55:53.339 --> 55:58.945
is that you don't need to
fill it with something dark.

55:58.978 --> 56:02.281
You're closer to death
than you've ever been.

56:03.115 --> 56:05.384
Well, that's not exactly true.

58:52.418 --> 58:53.886
Okay.

01:00:33.486 --> 01:00:35.087
Come back.

01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:37.089
Come back...

01:01:34.547 --> 01:01:35.614
Just one sec.

01:01:39.385 --> 01:01:41.820
I'm not actually buying these.
I just have a quick question.

01:01:41.855 --> 01:01:43.265
Uh, my husband
bought these from you,

01:01:43.289 --> 01:01:44.934
and I'm just wondering
if you could tell me

01:01:44.958 --> 01:01:46.292
whether he bought anything else,

01:01:46.325 --> 01:01:50.030
or whether he had something on hold?
Something like that?

01:01:50.062 --> 01:01:52.264
Um, we don't really
keep records like that.

01:01:53.232 --> 01:01:55.801
Okay. Could you tell me when?

01:01:55.834 --> 01:01:57.403
When he bought these?

01:01:57.436 --> 01:01:58.939
Maybe you have an inventory?

01:01:58.972 --> 01:02:00.639
- Not like that.
- Right.

01:02:00.673 --> 01:02:03.375
Could you tell me other books
by this author?

01:02:05.477 --> 01:02:06.812
Tsk.

01:02:06.845 --> 01:02:08.647
Let's see...

01:02:08.681 --> 01:02:09.682
It's Dyson.

01:02:10.749 --> 01:02:14.253
Think you probably want
sturgis, but okay...

01:02:59.531 --> 01:03:00.766
Hi.

01:03:01.567 --> 01:03:03.168
Hi.

01:03:03.202 --> 01:03:04.871
You work here?

01:03:04.904 --> 01:03:07.406
I do. Can I help you
with anything?

01:03:07.439 --> 01:03:08.741
Mm-mm.

01:03:12.078 --> 01:03:13.312
I'm Beth.

01:03:14.914 --> 01:03:16.649
Beth parchin.

01:03:17.616 --> 01:03:19.351
Madelyne.

01:03:20.352 --> 01:03:22.688
I think you knew my husband.

01:03:23.622 --> 01:03:26.625
- No, I don't...
- Owen. Owen parchin.

01:03:28.327 --> 01:03:31.397
There are pictures
of you on his phone.

01:03:32.798 --> 01:03:34.800
Jonah?

01:03:34.833 --> 01:03:36.903
It's all right. You don't
have to call for help.

01:03:36.936 --> 01:03:39.805
I'm not gonna...

01:03:41.007 --> 01:03:42.241
I mean...

01:03:44.044 --> 01:03:46.980
The matter's been resolved...

01:03:47.013 --> 01:03:48.882
I guess.

01:03:50.950 --> 01:03:53.119
- Oh.
- Yeah.

01:03:53.153 --> 01:03:54.453
He's dead.

01:03:55.788 --> 01:03:57.256
What?

01:03:57.289 --> 01:03:58.925
Suicide.

01:04:00.192 --> 01:04:02.327
Oh, my god.

01:04:02.361 --> 01:04:05.664
Just in case you had
any dates planned, or...

01:04:05.965 --> 01:04:07.100
Mm-mm.

01:04:07.133 --> 01:04:09.869
- It wasn't like that.
- Oh.

01:04:09.903 --> 01:04:13.305
Well, then would you mind
telling me what it was like?

01:04:15.808 --> 01:04:17.576
Sure. Um...

01:04:18.945 --> 01:04:23.282
He came in
a few times every year,

01:04:24.550 --> 01:04:26.819
and he was always friendly.

01:04:26.852 --> 01:04:31.724
We flirted some,
and he started coming more after that.

01:04:31.757 --> 01:04:34.861
We had a few drinks,
and that was it.

01:04:37.030 --> 01:04:38.464
Take your hair down.

01:04:38.497 --> 01:04:41.266
- What?
- Your hair. Ponytail.

01:04:41.300 --> 01:04:43.502
Lose it. Take it down.

01:04:43.535 --> 01:04:44.938
Why?

01:04:44.971 --> 01:04:47.611
Well, because you slept with my
husband, and I'm asking you nicely.

01:04:47.806 --> 01:04:48.807
I didn't...

01:05:12.899 --> 01:05:14.633
I didn't sleep with him.

01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:18.004
Honestly, I barely knew him.

01:05:20.339 --> 01:05:21.840
<i>For centuries, stories of the...</i>

01:05:21.875 --> 01:05:24.376
She said she barely
fucking knew him.

01:05:24.409 --> 01:05:25.511
What did you say?

01:05:25.544 --> 01:05:28.982
Same. I said, "same here, kid."

01:05:30.482 --> 01:05:31.583
Do you believe her?

01:05:31.617 --> 01:05:33.585
What? About them not fucking?

01:05:33.619 --> 01:05:34.820
Yeah.

01:05:34.853 --> 01:05:36.421
I do.

01:05:36.455 --> 01:05:38.091
Well, that's something.

01:05:38.124 --> 01:05:39.591
Nothing good.

01:05:39.625 --> 01:05:43.562
I mean, fucking, I get.
Fucking makes sense.

01:05:44.663 --> 01:05:47.934
There were others.
Our neighbor saw him with someone.

01:05:47.967 --> 01:05:48.801
Really?

01:05:48.834 --> 01:05:50.469
Yes. And I looked
on his computer,

01:05:50.502 --> 01:05:52.337
and there are tons of pictures,

01:05:52.371 --> 01:05:53.705
like half a dozen women.

01:05:53.739 --> 01:05:56.009
They all look a little bit like
me, but not quite.

01:05:56.042 --> 01:05:57.977
So if he wasn't fucking them,

01:05:58.011 --> 01:05:59.946
what the hell was he doing?

01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:04.284
I had this dream
the other night.

01:06:04.316 --> 01:06:07.120
It was our house, but not.

01:06:07.153 --> 01:06:09.122
It was backwards,

01:06:09.155 --> 01:06:10.389
and I saw him with someone...

01:06:10.422 --> 01:06:13.092
Stop. Stop it.

01:06:13.126 --> 01:06:15.494
Stop going through his stuff.

01:06:15.527 --> 01:06:17.563
Nothing you find
is gonna help you right now.

01:06:17.596 --> 01:06:20.499
Am I not being clear?
He had a secret life.

01:06:20.532 --> 01:06:22.768
Are you really gonna
stand there and lecture me

01:06:22.801 --> 01:06:25.737
about his posthumous right
to privacy?

01:06:27.406 --> 01:06:31.476
I understand you're
experiencing these things,

01:06:31.510 --> 01:06:33.478
but I'm worried about you.

01:06:33.512 --> 01:06:36.115
Maybe take a step back.

01:06:39.185 --> 01:06:41.453
I don't know.

01:06:50.429 --> 01:06:52.598
I felt him.

01:06:54.167 --> 01:06:56.035
I felt my husband.

01:07:00.672 --> 01:07:03.475
"You were right.
There's nothing."

01:07:04.944 --> 01:07:08.680
Why would he say there's nothing?
He didn't believe that.

01:07:09.983 --> 01:07:11.783
Beliefs change.

01:07:12.417 --> 01:07:14.386
Look at you.

01:07:14.419 --> 01:07:15.865
You're the most
skeptical person I know,

01:07:15.889 --> 01:07:18.657
and here you are,
telling me that your house is haunted.

01:07:28.767 --> 01:07:31.237
Yeah, I mean,
when you put it like that,

01:07:31.271 --> 01:07:33.472
it does sound kinda silly.

01:07:33.505 --> 01:07:35.807
Don't go home.

01:07:35.841 --> 01:07:37.442
Get away from the lake
for a while.

01:07:38.044 --> 01:07:40.346
You can stay here, even.

01:07:40.380 --> 01:07:42.982
You can stay
as long as you want.

01:07:43.950 --> 01:07:45.952
It's not finished.

01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:50.890
Not everything gets finished.

01:07:50.924 --> 01:07:53.960
You may never know
what he was thinking.

01:07:55.261 --> 01:07:58.463
He's gone. You're not.

01:08:00.632 --> 01:08:03.169
You still have a life to live.

01:08:07.974 --> 01:08:10.343
No, you're right.

01:08:10.376 --> 01:08:13.112
I could use the distance.

01:08:13.146 --> 01:08:15.915
I'll go pack a few more things.
Get a bag.

01:08:15.949 --> 01:08:19.152
Book into a room
for a couple nights.

01:08:19.185 --> 01:08:22.854
- I can't tell if you're being serious.
- I am.

01:08:22.889 --> 01:08:26.825
And you've made some
excellent points. Really.

01:08:28.060 --> 01:08:30.095
I love you.

01:08:34.633 --> 01:08:36.402
Just call me later, okay?

01:08:36.435 --> 01:08:38.071
I will.

01:09:17.642 --> 01:09:19.312
I'm leaving.

01:09:19.345 --> 01:09:22.281
Tonight, I guess.

01:09:23.950 --> 01:09:27.719
So, if you've got something to say to
me, you better say it now.

01:09:32.992 --> 01:09:34.861
You hear me?

01:09:41.666 --> 01:09:44.470
Motherfucker.

01:10:03.322 --> 01:10:04.323
Hey!

01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:11.696
Sorry.
I didn't think you were home.

01:10:12.398 --> 01:10:13.900
I'm home.

01:10:15.401 --> 01:10:17.470
I don't think I should be here.

01:10:17.503 --> 01:10:19.738
How did you know where to go?

01:10:19.771 --> 01:10:23.076
Well, I've been here before.

01:10:32.818 --> 01:10:35.821
I probably should have told
you earlier at the bookstore,

01:10:35.855 --> 01:10:38.958
but, uh, honestly,
you freaked me out a little.

01:10:39.624 --> 01:10:41.593
Sorry about that.

01:10:42.694 --> 01:10:45.865
No, I get it. Totally.

01:10:47.500 --> 01:10:51.204
I probably would have
done the same thing.

01:10:52.105 --> 01:10:53.873
It's funny, really,

01:10:53.906 --> 01:10:55.607
I laid down for a
minute after work,

01:10:55.640 --> 01:10:59.145
and I had this dream.

01:10:59.711 --> 01:11:01.813
I dreamed I was you.

01:11:01.847 --> 01:11:04.984
Well, I was me,
but I was you, too,

01:11:05.017 --> 01:11:08.888
and something was chasing you,
and it was all around you.

01:11:08.921 --> 01:11:10.089
Well, us.

01:11:10.123 --> 01:11:13.159
But did it get us?

01:11:13.192 --> 01:11:16.329
I'm not sure.
That's when I woke up.

01:11:17.463 --> 01:11:20.233
Afterwards,
I couldn't stop thinking about you.

01:11:21.666 --> 01:11:24.971
I figured there's something
you should know.

01:11:25.905 --> 01:11:28.673
- Stuff that happened.
- Phew.

01:11:32.612 --> 01:11:34.813
I told you I didn't sleep
with your husband.

01:11:34.846 --> 01:11:38.317
Yeah, you can use his name.
He wasn't "my husband" to you.

01:11:38.351 --> 01:11:39.684
Right.

01:11:40.553 --> 01:11:42.321
Well, I meant it.

01:11:43.222 --> 01:11:45.324
I didn't sleep with him.

01:11:45.358 --> 01:11:50.263
But I would have.
I thought we would, but...

01:11:50.296 --> 01:11:52.831
He came by one afternoon

01:11:52.865 --> 01:11:54.666
after I was getting off,

01:11:54.699 --> 01:11:58.204
and he invited me here,
like a... like a day trip.

01:11:58.237 --> 01:11:59.939
And normally,
I wouldn't have gone,

01:11:59.972 --> 01:12:03.576
but he was smart,
and sweet, and...

01:12:03.609 --> 01:12:08.414
I don't know. I just kind of
felt safe with him, you know?

01:12:08.915 --> 01:12:10.249
I do.

01:12:10.283 --> 01:12:11.716
Right.

01:12:11.750 --> 01:12:14.921
So, yeah, um, he took me here

01:12:14.954 --> 01:12:18.157
and, uh, we had a drink.

01:12:18.191 --> 01:12:21.360
We walked to the lake,
and he showed me the other house...

01:12:21.394 --> 01:12:24.230
Wait. You've seen it?

01:12:24.263 --> 01:12:28.401
Well, it's not much to see,
but he was really proud of it, though.

01:12:28.434 --> 01:12:29.801
I mean, giddy, almost.

01:12:29.834 --> 01:12:32.138
Showing me around
from room to room.

01:12:32.171 --> 01:12:36.409
And then, he showed me this weird
statue, and he asked me to hold it.

01:12:37.410 --> 01:12:39.478
And you did?

01:12:41.414 --> 01:12:44.350
What exactly did he do to you?

01:12:49.222 --> 01:12:50.789
Nothing.

01:12:52.824 --> 01:12:54.826
He held me...

01:12:55.695 --> 01:12:57.129
Sort of.

01:12:57.163 --> 01:13:02.201
He put his chin
on my shoulder and...

01:13:02.235 --> 01:13:05.238
Look, I know it sounds weird
saying it out loud,

01:13:05.271 --> 01:13:06.838
but at the time,

01:13:06.872 --> 01:13:09.108
it felt really nice.

01:13:09.141 --> 01:13:12.945
Having someone close to you.

01:13:12.979 --> 01:13:15.147
Feeling them there.

01:13:16.482 --> 01:13:17.849
I...

01:13:17.883 --> 01:13:19.552
I felt him shake.

01:13:19.585 --> 01:13:24.390
And he was crying a little,
and I didn't know what to do.

01:13:24.423 --> 01:13:26.259
What did he do to you?

01:13:26.292 --> 01:13:30.829
I kissed him.
He kissed me back and...

01:13:31.731 --> 01:13:34.200
It was very sweet at first.

01:13:36.202 --> 01:13:37.903
So, I... I...

01:13:39.472 --> 01:13:42.774
Didn't stop him when he
put his hands on my back.

01:13:44.343 --> 01:13:47.346
And I didn't stop him when
he put his hands on my neck.

01:13:47.980 --> 01:13:50.716
Until he started squeezing.

01:13:50.750 --> 01:13:53.419
Oh, my god.

01:13:53.452 --> 01:13:56.389
I probably misread him,
you know? I just...

01:13:56.422 --> 01:13:59.892
Everybody has a different
barometer for that kind of thing.

01:13:59.925 --> 01:14:01.627
Did he hurt you?

01:14:01.661 --> 01:14:03.562
God, no!

01:14:03.596 --> 01:14:05.631
I asked him to stop,
and he stopped.

01:14:05.665 --> 01:14:07.400
But do you think he would have?

01:14:07.433 --> 01:14:08.800
But he didn't.

01:14:08.833 --> 01:14:10.703
He drove me home.

01:14:10.736 --> 01:14:14.006
He said it was his fault,
not mine.

01:14:14.874 --> 01:14:17.076
That he was tired and confused,

01:14:17.109 --> 01:14:19.811
and he didn't know what was him,

01:14:19.844 --> 01:14:23.516
and it wasn't working anymore.

01:14:24.684 --> 01:14:27.953
He was afraid
he couldn't hold it back.

01:14:27.987 --> 01:14:29.555
Hold what back?

01:14:29.588 --> 01:14:31.857
I don't know exactly.

01:14:31.891 --> 01:14:33.793
But in the end,

01:14:33.825 --> 01:14:36.595
he said he knew
what he had to do.

01:14:37.663 --> 01:14:40.333
He had to end it for good.

01:14:42.868 --> 01:14:43.936
Look...

01:14:43.969 --> 01:14:45.137
I just wanted to tell you.

01:14:45.171 --> 01:14:48.007
He clearly felt guilty
about cheating on you.

01:14:51.744 --> 01:14:54.347
That's what he was
talking about, right?

01:16:18.597 --> 01:16:20.599
We need to talk.

01:16:22.968 --> 01:16:26.071
I'm not leaving until we do.

01:16:27.473 --> 01:16:31.610
You called, I came.

01:16:37.918 --> 01:16:41.020
Don't you wanna talk to me?

01:16:43.989 --> 01:16:46.425
You talked to her.

01:16:53.132 --> 01:16:57.536
I'm here. I'm still here.

01:16:58.771 --> 01:17:01.507
Wherever you are...

01:17:03.944 --> 01:17:06.078
Come and get me.

01:17:15.754 --> 01:17:18.057
Just come get me!

01:17:27.766 --> 01:17:30.202
Okay.

01:18:17.850 --> 01:18:20.319
Fucking...

01:18:44.209 --> 01:18:46.845
Okay. Okay.
Come on, pick up the phone.

01:18:46.880 --> 01:18:47.948
<i>Claire woodward...</i>

01:18:47.981 --> 01:18:49.015
Fuck!

01:18:49.049 --> 01:18:50.158
<i>Is not available. At the tone,</i>

01:18:50.182 --> 01:18:52.318
<i>please record your message.</i>

01:18:52.351 --> 01:18:56.121
I'm sorry.
Hey, it's, uh... it's late.

01:18:56.822 --> 01:18:58.424
And, uh...

01:18:59.291 --> 01:19:02.127
I should have listened to you.

01:19:02.161 --> 01:19:05.297
I did something
that I shouldn't have.

01:19:05.331 --> 01:19:08.300
I went across the lake,
and I saw something.

01:19:08.334 --> 01:19:10.169
I saw something so...

01:19:12.371 --> 01:19:14.840
I don't even know
if it's real or not.

01:19:18.310 --> 01:19:20.880
I know my husband.

01:19:20.914 --> 01:19:23.716
I know who he is,

01:19:23.749 --> 01:19:27.786
and I refuse to believe
that he would have...

01:19:30.056 --> 01:19:32.424
I don't know.

01:19:35.394 --> 01:19:39.264
I wish that you were here.

01:19:41.767 --> 01:19:44.136
I wish that it were morning.

01:21:13.358 --> 01:21:15.594
No.

01:21:15.627 --> 01:21:17.496
Stop it.

01:21:22.835 --> 01:21:24.670
Owen?

01:21:37.483 --> 01:21:39.785
Where are you?

01:21:43.089 --> 01:21:45.158
I just...

01:21:45.191 --> 01:21:46.960
I don't understand.

01:21:48.061 --> 01:21:50.496
Please come back.

01:22:05.011 --> 01:22:07.046
Oh, god.

01:22:09.015 --> 01:22:12.651
I miss you so much.

01:24:39.098 --> 01:24:41.200
Is this real?

01:24:41.234 --> 01:24:42.701
Are you really here?

01:25:01.287 --> 01:25:03.588
Hold me. Hold me.

01:25:19.105 --> 01:25:20.639
You're really here?

01:25:22.175 --> 01:25:24.043
<i>Yes.</i>

01:25:29.182 --> 01:25:30.849
<i>I'm here.</i>

01:25:46.332 --> 01:25:47.867
Owen?

01:25:50.336 --> 01:25:52.038
<i>No.</i>

01:25:53.239 --> 01:25:55.674
<i>I'm not Owen.</i>

01:26:00.612 --> 01:26:02.848
Fuck. Fuck.

01:26:41.287 --> 01:26:43.256
No, stop it.

01:27:58.331 --> 01:27:59.365
Hide.

01:27:59.966 --> 01:28:00.967
What?

01:29:48.107 --> 01:29:49.308
Owen?

01:30:41.627 --> 01:30:43.195
You left.

01:30:44.497 --> 01:30:45.498
What?

01:30:47.667 --> 01:30:49.268
The night we met.

01:30:52.338 --> 01:30:54.106
You're not Owen.

01:30:55.741 --> 01:30:59.245
I'm what you felt
when your heart stopped.

01:31:00.513 --> 01:31:02.515
No. I felt...

01:31:02.548 --> 01:31:04.050
Nothing.

01:31:05.785 --> 01:31:07.887
Do you remember?

01:31:08.721 --> 01:31:10.589
You saw me.

01:31:10.623 --> 01:31:13.159
And I've been
with you ever since.

01:31:13.192 --> 01:31:15.827
What did you do to my husband?

01:31:19.699 --> 01:31:21.500
<i>I went to him.</i>

01:31:22.935 --> 01:31:25.371
<i>I whispered in his ear</i>

01:31:25.404 --> 01:31:27.873
<i>over and over.</i>

01:31:29.508 --> 01:31:31.310
<i>To send you back.</i>

01:31:56.769 --> 01:31:58.037
But he wouldn't.

01:31:59.071 --> 01:32:01.407
He sent me them instead.

01:32:05.911 --> 01:32:07.646
He tricked you.

01:32:08.347 --> 01:32:10.049
For a while.

01:32:26.265 --> 01:32:27.266
Shit.

01:32:29.001 --> 01:32:30.236
<i>Stop.</i>

01:32:32.071 --> 01:32:34.373
<i>Don't fight.</i>

01:32:34.807 --> 01:32:36.075
No!

01:32:36.108 --> 01:32:38.210
<i>Beth.</i>

01:34:22.916 --> 01:34:24.450
Beth?

01:34:26.485 --> 01:34:27.686
Hello?

01:34:36.963 --> 01:34:38.697
Beth, are you here?

01:34:42.101 --> 01:34:44.036
I'm coming up.

01:34:53.345 --> 01:34:54.413
Beth?

01:34:55.748 --> 01:34:57.283
Beth!

01:36:09.956 --> 01:36:11.724
Where is he?

01:36:22.468 --> 01:36:23.903
Gone.

01:36:27.239 --> 01:36:29.508
But you already knew that.

01:36:42.221 --> 01:36:43.857
What the fuck?

01:36:52.231 --> 01:36:53.432
Oh, my god.

01:36:55.902 --> 01:36:56.903
Beth!

01:37:23.529 --> 01:37:26.432
He thought he could protect you.

01:37:27.599 --> 01:37:29.468
He was wrong.

01:37:30.369 --> 01:37:32.271
You were right.

01:37:42.916 --> 01:37:44.316
Beth!

01:37:46.218 --> 01:37:47.954
Beth!

01:37:54.259 --> 01:37:56.328
There is nothing.

01:37:58.797 --> 01:37:59.933
Beth!

01:38:04.670 --> 01:38:06.705
There is only me.

01:38:20.319 --> 01:38:22.788
Come back to me.

01:38:36.870 --> 01:38:38.604
<i>Beth!</i>

01:38:48.413 --> 01:38:50.482
It doesn't matter.

01:38:52.718 --> 01:38:54.386
Let go.

01:38:58.791 --> 01:39:00.726
Come back to me.

01:39:35.962 --> 01:39:37.096
Beth!

01:39:38.664 --> 01:39:39.665
Beth!

01:39:41.433 --> 01:39:43.468
Oh, my god.

01:39:50.475 --> 01:39:51.978
I'm right here.

01:39:52.011 --> 01:39:54.746
Keep your head up. This way.

01:40:06.259 --> 01:40:08.427
- Is she okay?
- I don't know.

01:40:08.460 --> 01:40:09.728
What happened?

01:40:09.761 --> 01:40:12.631
- I don't know.
- I don't know.

01:40:12.664 --> 01:40:15.434
Beth? Are you here?
Are you here?

01:40:15.467 --> 01:40:18.804
I'm here, I'm here.

01:40:20.306 --> 01:40:21.740
I'm here.

01:40:22.541 --> 01:40:23.877
I got you.

01:40:23.910 --> 01:40:25.044
I'm here.

01:40:28.248 --> 01:40:30.149
I got you, I got you.

01:40:31.217 --> 01:40:33.887
I'm right here. I'm here.

01:40:37.957 --> 01:40:39.158
Just breathe.

01:40:41.827 --> 01:40:43.528
You're safe now.

01:40:43.562 --> 01:40:46.065
You're okay,
you're gonna be okay.

01:41:07.552 --> 01:41:09.088
What is it?

01:41:12.125 --> 01:41:13.525
There's nothing there.

01:41:18.965 --> 01:41:20.033
I know.
