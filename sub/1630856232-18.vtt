00:09.134 --> 00:11.386
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:12.262 --> 00:15.015
Daly: Tonight,
the playoffs begin.

00:15.056 --> 00:19.102
* Shut your mouth, baby,
stand and deliver *
Oh, my God!

00:19.144 --> 00:20.937
* Holy hands,
will they make me a sinner? *
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

00:20.979 --> 00:23.565
Daly: And for the first time
in "Voice" history...
Ah!

00:23.606 --> 00:26.693
...each coach
has one super save.

00:26.735 --> 00:28.028
Oh, my God!

00:28.069 --> 00:29.362
Welcome back to "The Voice."

00:29.404 --> 00:32.198
The coaches get to
bring one person back.

00:32.240 --> 00:34.367
Anybody out of any team.

00:34.409 --> 00:36.661
And I have chosen you.
[ Woman screams]

00:36.703 --> 00:38.079
I love the super save.

00:38.121 --> 00:40.915
You're just too good
to stay at home.

00:40.957 --> 00:42.292
Welcome to the playoffs.

00:42.334 --> 00:44.210
This year,
there are so many great artists

00:44.252 --> 00:45.879
that we had to let go.

00:45.920 --> 00:47.505
It gives them another chance...
[ Shouts indistinctly ]

00:47.547 --> 00:49.883
...to give
another great performance.

00:49.924 --> 00:51.968
* I can still hear you saying *
Daly: With artists returning,
the competition is fierce.

00:52.010 --> 00:53.720
* You would never break
the chain *
Way to go, girl!

00:53.762 --> 00:56.556
All of these artists
are just, like, one step away

00:56.598 --> 00:58.308
from the live shows
and being in the top 12.

00:58.350 --> 01:00.477
Wow.
Perfect.

01:00.518 --> 01:02.729
* I wanna take the walls down
with you *
John: I'm excited
for the playoffs,

01:02.771 --> 01:04.856
but the idea of cutting my team
down from six to three

01:04.898 --> 01:06.649
is making me a little anxious.

01:06.691 --> 01:08.485
* Sometimes I feel like saying,
"Lord, I just don't care" *

01:08.526 --> 01:09.736
Niall: The stakes
in the playoffs are so high,

01:09.778 --> 01:12.364
and there are
no steals or saves.

01:12.405 --> 01:13.990
* But you've got the love I need
to see me through *
Niall:
...so I'm looking for artists

01:14.032 --> 01:15.575
to really step up
and show me that they're ready.

01:15.617 --> 01:17.285
Whoo! Got goosebumps.
That was good.

01:17.327 --> 01:19.287
You haveto go to the lives.

01:19.329 --> 01:20.622
Niall: And if you
don't go to the lives,

01:20.663 --> 01:23.333
Reba's getting fired.
[ Laughter ]

01:23.375 --> 01:25.669
Daly: First up,
Team Niall takes the stage.

01:25.710 --> 01:30.256
Alright.
Tonight is all about Team Niall.

01:30.298 --> 01:33.051
Niall's team is insane.

01:33.093 --> 01:35.762
I don't know how Niall
is going to make this decision.

01:35.804 --> 01:38.473
I'm just glad I don't have
to do it. Rough stuff.

01:38.515 --> 01:40.141
I wouldn't want that job.
I'm praying for him.

01:40.183 --> 01:41.768
About all I can do.

01:41.810 --> 01:44.979
This decision
is going to be horrendous.

01:45.021 --> 01:46.773
Oh, oh.

01:47.565 --> 01:49.025
Nini!

01:49.067 --> 01:51.027
[ Chuckling ]
Hello! Look at that.

01:51.069 --> 01:53.655
I'm so happy to be back!
I'm glad.

01:53.697 --> 01:55.490
Nini Iris --
she's got a huge voice.

01:55.532 --> 01:56.741
She's got a great look.

01:56.783 --> 01:58.535
She's like
a ready-made pop star.

01:58.576 --> 02:00.453
Nini: I'm so grateful
for this chance

02:00.495 --> 02:02.789
to prove I'm worthy
of being here.
You are.

02:02.831 --> 02:04.749
Also, the fact that you gave me
this song

02:04.791 --> 02:05.959
is, like, mind-blowing.

02:06.001 --> 02:07.002
Bishop Briggs' "River"

02:07.043 --> 02:08.253
is the perfect song for Nini.

02:08.294 --> 02:09.546
It's a big challenge,

02:09.587 --> 02:11.297
but if anyone
can step up to it,

02:11.339 --> 02:12.382
it's Nini Iris.

02:12.424 --> 02:15.677
* How do you fall in love? *

02:15.719 --> 02:18.513
Nini:
It's a very empowering song.
* Harder than a bullet
could hit ya? *

02:18.555 --> 02:20.765
It's about going up to somebody
and asking them

02:20.807 --> 02:23.226
to push you to your limits.
* How do you fall apart? *

02:23.268 --> 02:26.688
In my case, I am singing
this song to myself.

02:26.730 --> 02:28.732
* Shut your mouth, baby,
stand and deliver *

02:28.773 --> 02:30.859
Growing up
in the country of Georgia...

02:30.900 --> 02:32.610
* Holy hands,
will they make me a sinner? *
...it's always been such a dream

02:32.652 --> 02:36.364
to come here and succeed
on an American stage.

02:36.406 --> 02:39.075
* Like a river,
like a river *
With this competition,
I want to tell a story...

02:39.117 --> 02:41.995
* Shut your mouth
and run me like a... *
...that I've worked so hard,
and I'm finally here...

02:42.037 --> 02:43.496
* Choke this love till the veins
start to shiver *
...and it's possible.

02:43.538 --> 02:46.833
I just really have to bring
my 200% of Nini.

02:46.875 --> 02:48.168
It's getting to the point
where it's funny

02:48.209 --> 02:49.711
how good you are.
[ Laughs ]

02:49.753 --> 02:51.504
I think you should sing
the first verse straighter.

02:51.546 --> 02:53.798
* How do you fall in love? *

02:53.840 --> 02:56.092
Just really concentrate
on them small moments

02:56.134 --> 02:57.385
'cause
they're so effective.

02:57.427 --> 02:58.845
It's like
blind auditions Nini,

02:58.887 --> 03:00.722
but, like,
bigger and better.
Mm-hmm.

03:00.764 --> 03:04.351
And slayer.
Just slay the verse
and slay the chorus,

03:04.392 --> 03:05.560
and then just mic drop.

03:05.602 --> 03:07.687
Nini has had
some big performances,

03:07.729 --> 03:10.231
but [Chuckling] this one's
going to blow everyone away.

03:10.273 --> 03:12.067
You need to give us
a big moment,

03:12.108 --> 03:13.401
because all of a sudden,

03:13.443 --> 03:15.612
like, six turns into three
straightaway.

03:15.653 --> 03:19.532
I'm this close to make it
to the top 12 to the live shows.

03:19.574 --> 03:22.952
I need to deliver the best
performance of my entire life.

03:22.994 --> 03:24.996
Like, I want him to, like,
look at other coaches

03:25.038 --> 03:28.208
while I'm performing
and, like, go like,

03:28.249 --> 03:30.418
"Yeah, she's on my team."
[ Laughs ]

03:30.460 --> 03:31.920
[ Cheers and applause ]

03:31.961 --> 03:33.922
Did you style her, Niall?

03:33.963 --> 03:35.215
Yes.
Yes?

03:35.256 --> 03:37.217
Can you not tell?
Obviously.

03:37.258 --> 03:39.302
Wow, cool outfit.

03:39.344 --> 03:42.180
With "River,"
here's Nini Iris.

03:42.222 --> 03:43.431
[ Cheers and applause ]

03:43.473 --> 03:47.102
* Like a river,
like a river *

03:47.143 --> 03:50.730
* How do you fall in love? *

03:50.772 --> 03:54.609
* Harder than a bullet
could hit ya? *

03:54.651 --> 03:58.363
* How do you fall apart? *

03:58.405 --> 04:00.907
* Faster
than a hair pin trigger? *

04:00.949 --> 04:05.662
* Don't you say,
don't you say it *

04:05.704 --> 04:09.374
* Don't say,
don't you say it *

04:09.416 --> 04:13.420
* One breath,
it'll just break it *

04:13.461 --> 04:17.424
* So shut your mouth
and run me like a river *

04:17.465 --> 04:21.136
* Shut your mouth, baby,
stand and deliver *

04:21.177 --> 04:25.598
* Holy hands,
will they make me a sinner? *

04:25.640 --> 04:28.852
* Like a river,
like a river *

04:28.893 --> 04:33.064
* Shut your mouth
and run me like a river *

04:33.106 --> 04:34.733
Whoo!

04:36.651 --> 04:40.447
* Tales of an endless heart *

04:40.488 --> 04:44.325
* Cursed is the fool
who's willing *

04:44.367 --> 04:48.288
* Can't change the way we are *

04:48.329 --> 04:50.957
* One kiss away from killing *

don't you say it *

04:55.003 --> 04:59.132

don't you say *

04:59.174 --> 05:03.386

it'll just break it *

* And run me like a... *
* Run me like a river *

will they make me a sinner? *

05:15.607 --> 05:18.777

like a river *

* Shut your mouth *

* And run me like a... *
* Run me like a river *

05:23.907 --> 05:24.491
* Choke this love *

05:27.077 --> 05:28.286
* One last breath
till the tears start to wither *

05:29.412 --> 05:30.955
[ Laughing ]
* Woooo *

05:30.997 --> 05:34.167
* Like a river,
like a river *

05:34.209 --> 05:38.755
* Shut your mouth
and run me like a river *

[ Cheers and applause ]

05:41.883 --> 05:44.010
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

05:44.052 --> 05:46.805
Daly: That is Nini Iris.
Wow, a lot of power.

05:46.846 --> 05:48.848
Now, let's get some thoughts
from our coaches.

05:48.890 --> 05:50.558
Gwen, we'll start with you.
Gwen: Wow.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.018
You can do anything
with your voice.

05:52.060 --> 05:55.647
But yet you are so tasteful,
you don't overdo it.

05:55.689 --> 05:57.857
You're always, like,
building it to the right moment.

05:57.899 --> 05:59.567
And I just think
that you're so gifted.

05:59.609 --> 06:02.070
You have such an intuition
about yourself,

06:02.112 --> 06:03.279
and that's what we want.

06:03.321 --> 06:04.614
I thought it was incredible.

06:04.656 --> 06:06.741
Thank you so much.
Thank you, Gwen.
John?

06:06.783 --> 06:10.161
You just every week are showing
that you're a real star.

06:10.203 --> 06:14.457
And you present yourself with
such confidence and such skill.

06:14.499 --> 06:16.876
I am just genuinely
amazed by you.

06:16.918 --> 06:19.004
We all wish we had you
on our team.

06:19.045 --> 06:20.505
[ Laughter ]

06:20.547 --> 06:22.257
Great job, Nini.
Thank you so much.

06:22.298 --> 06:23.591
Queen Reba.

06:23.633 --> 06:25.218
Hey, Nini.
Hi.

06:25.260 --> 06:26.594
I loved your performance.

06:26.636 --> 06:29.556
I think you are
a very strong vocalist,

06:29.597 --> 06:31.599
but I'm going to disagree
a little bit.

06:31.641 --> 06:33.685
I love
the strong woman song,

06:33.727 --> 06:35.729
but I think you took it
just a little bit too far

06:35.770 --> 06:37.897
in your choreography.

06:37.939 --> 06:39.899
But you're great.
I love your voice.

06:39.941 --> 06:41.151
Daly: Fair enough.
Thank you, Reba.

06:41.192 --> 06:42.736
Thank you so much.
Coach Niall?

06:42.777 --> 06:45.613
Every time you come out here,
it gets better and better.

06:45.655 --> 06:47.907
And the notes you hit
get more powerful.

06:47.949 --> 06:49.701
We're missing that
in the industry.

06:49.743 --> 06:52.037
There's no big belters out there
that have such control

06:52.078 --> 06:54.622
and such a uniqueness
to them like you do.

06:54.664 --> 06:56.750
I'm just constantly
blown away by you.

06:56.791 --> 06:58.251
How about another big hand
for Nini Iris,

06:58.293 --> 07:00.086
ladies and gentlemen?
[ Cheers and applause ]

07:00.128 --> 07:02.088
Gwen: Nini --
it's beyond understanding

07:02.130 --> 07:03.882
that someone can sing
[Chuckling] the way she does,

07:03.923 --> 07:06.468
so she's definitely a threat.

07:06.509 --> 07:07.927
Yes, Nini!
Killed it.

07:07.969 --> 07:10.513
I have to send
three people home.

07:10.555 --> 07:12.599
If this is a sign
of what's to come,

07:12.640 --> 07:15.894
we're in for a night
of insane performances.

07:15.935 --> 07:17.604
Jesus, she can sing.
I know. It's crazy.

07:17.645 --> 07:19.606
She's a no-brainer.

07:19.647 --> 07:21.691
Daly: Coming up...
* From the daylight,
runnin' from the daylight *

07:21.733 --> 07:23.777
Whoo-whoo!
Daly: ...artists give
the performances of their lives

07:23.818 --> 07:27.072
hoping to earn one of the final
three spots on Team Niall.

07:27.113 --> 07:28.198
You're already a star.

07:28.239 --> 07:29.824
It's a no-brainer to go
to the lives.

07:29.866 --> 07:31.993
They're all no-brainers,
Niall.

07:32.035 --> 07:33.536
Why?!

07:39.501 --> 07:40.669
* This is "The Voice" *

07:40.710 --> 07:41.753
Daly: Welcome back
to the playoffs

07:41.795 --> 07:43.171
at Universal Studios Hollywood.

07:43.213 --> 07:45.131
John: I like
your outfit, Reba.
And look.

07:45.173 --> 07:47.717
You got your rocker chains
back there...
Gwen: Yes!

07:47.759 --> 07:49.469
...and then Gwen's
rock star Barbie.

07:49.511 --> 07:51.971
I didn't realize everyone was
going to, like, up the stakes.

07:52.013 --> 07:53.556
This is just me
going to the store.

07:53.598 --> 07:54.849
[ Laughs ]

07:54.891 --> 07:56.935
Wow, Niall.
Team Niall's looking good.

07:56.976 --> 07:58.019
I'm excited,
but I'm also really nervous.

07:58.061 --> 07:59.479
I don't know
what you're gonna do.

07:59.521 --> 08:00.772
I know, I don't...
I don't know what --

08:00.814 --> 08:02.148
I don't know what
I'm going to do, either.

08:02.190 --> 08:04.442
It's going to be
really painful.
Yeah.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.986
Alright, I'm going to learn
from you today, okay?
Mm-hmm.

08:07.028 --> 08:08.446
So, let's go watch.
Let's do it.

08:08.488 --> 08:09.823
Let's do it.

08:09.864 --> 08:12.867
Oh, I'm nervous now.
[ Laughs ]

08:12.909 --> 08:15.036
Niall: My save.
Claudia: Twice!

08:15.078 --> 08:16.788
Hello.
I'm indebted --
indebted to you.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.581
Niall: Claudia's growth
from the blind auditions to now,

08:18.623 --> 08:20.000
it's night and day.

08:20.041 --> 08:22.544
I saved you because what you did
was just undeniable.

08:22.585 --> 08:23.962
So jazzy and beautiful.

08:24.004 --> 08:25.755
It felt like you were
the only person in the room.

08:25.797 --> 08:27.590
John was, like,
nearly standing on his chair.

08:27.632 --> 08:29.426
I was like,
"Ooh, ooh, oh! Hmm."

08:29.467 --> 08:31.136
[ Laughter ]

08:31.177 --> 08:32.679
I've got a lot of love
for Claudia.

08:32.721 --> 08:34.014
She used to be Team Legend...
Yes!

08:34.055 --> 08:37.058
...and then I had a chance
to steal her.

08:37.809 --> 08:39.728
Daly:
Whoa! Whoa!

08:39.769 --> 08:40.770
She's an amazing vocalist.

08:40.812 --> 08:42.731
I'm so happy that she's here.

08:42.772 --> 08:44.190
I'm gonna stay
on Niall.

08:44.232 --> 08:45.775
I just wish she would
have been on Team Legend.

08:45.817 --> 08:47.027
Claudia: I'm feeling
a little bit nervous

08:47.068 --> 08:48.903
'cause it feels real
all of a sudden,

08:48.945 --> 08:50.405
but I love this song.

08:50.447 --> 08:52.073
Great pick.
It's so popular.

* At night
when the stars... *

08:53.324 --> 08:54.826
Niall: For the playoffs,
Claudia will sing

08:54.868 --> 08:56.494
"Talking to the Moon"
by Bruno Mars.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.913
* ...light up my room *
Whoo!

08:58.955 --> 09:01.666
* I sit by myself *
Claudia would fit right in
in the music industry right now.

09:01.708 --> 09:03.543
She's got a bit
of a jazz influence.

09:03.585 --> 09:05.920
* Talking to the moon *
She's got an R&B influence.

09:05.962 --> 09:07.213
She's got
a singer/songwriter voice.

09:07.255 --> 09:09.090
We're really missing
a lot of that.

09:09.132 --> 09:11.885
And this is the perfect song for
Claudia to show who Claudia is.

09:11.926 --> 09:13.595
Can you attach yourself
to this emotionally?
Yeah.

09:13.636 --> 09:16.097
'Cause that would help.
Oh, yeah. I'm missing
someone right now.

09:16.139 --> 09:17.432
Oh, yeah, your fiancé.
Yeah.

09:17.474 --> 09:19.309
This is the longest
I've ever been apart

09:19.351 --> 09:20.727
from my fiancé, Jacob.

09:20.769 --> 09:22.020
Another week,
another gig.

09:22.062 --> 09:23.938
At home, I see him
pretty much all day.

09:23.980 --> 09:26.441
He's also a musician.
We gig together.

09:26.483 --> 09:28.151
So it's so much motivation
for me...
* Ohh, ohh, ohhh *

09:28.193 --> 09:29.778
...because
I've been gone so long,

09:29.819 --> 09:31.071
I have to make it worth it.

09:31.112 --> 09:32.822
Whew!
That's so good.

09:32.864 --> 09:35.367
I think you just need
to get even more emotional.

09:35.408 --> 09:37.494
Open your eyes.
Look down the camera.
Yeah.

09:37.535 --> 09:39.412
Yeah.
Some of our favorite singers
of all time

09:39.454 --> 09:42.791
are the people that can tell
the story the best.
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

Thank you for saying that.

09:44.209 --> 09:46.670

to Adele.
Yeah.

So, I want
to make Niall proud.

I want to make him say,

two times in a row."

I think Claudia is going to make
John regret letting her go.

10:07.023 --> 10:08.608
This is my favorite one yet.
Less is more.

10:08.650 --> 10:09.901
If she can nail
her performance

10:09.943 --> 10:11.861
in a pressurized environment
like that,

10:11.903 --> 10:14.030

of making it to the lives.

Claudia, great job.

12:27.163 --> 12:29.207
Let's go to your former coach.
You remember John Legend.

12:29.249 --> 12:30.458
John, what did you think?
Hi, John.

12:30.500 --> 12:32.377
Claudia, you sound
as good as ever.

12:32.419 --> 12:35.171
Thank you.
Your voice is
even richer today

12:35.213 --> 12:37.632
than I think you've even been
in the past round.
Mm.

12:37.674 --> 12:41.177
I think my favorite performance
is still the Norah Jones song,

12:41.219 --> 12:43.346
capturing the essence
of who you are

12:43.388 --> 12:45.306
as a vocalist
and as a musician.

12:45.348 --> 12:46.975
But this is really beautiful,
as well.

Bruno Mars fan,

12:52.897 --> 12:54.941
And you made it
your own song.

12:54.983 --> 12:57.318
I was totally captivated
by yourvoice.

She's a strong contender.

13:01.906 --> 13:03.867
Very good job.
Thank you, Reba.

That was beautiful.
Thank you.

The early part of that song
was just so beautiful.

I had goosebumps, like,
listening to it.
Me, too.
Mm-hmm.

one of her best performances,

a lot harder on Niall.

18:23.395 --> 18:25.021
John, what'd you think?

18:25.063 --> 18:26.898
What you're giving us
onstage

18:26.940 --> 18:29.859
is well beyond a competition.

18:29.901 --> 18:31.069
You're already a star.

18:31.111 --> 18:34.197
You carry yourself
that way with confidence,

18:34.239 --> 18:36.658
with that distinctive voice.

18:36.700 --> 18:39.327
And the execution every time
is just flawless.

18:39.369 --> 18:40.704
It's beyond the lives.

18:40.745 --> 18:43.248
You belong as one
of the Grammy-winning artists

18:43.289 --> 18:45.125
that are singing
in our finale.

18:45.166 --> 18:46.376
[ Cheers and applause ]

18:46.418 --> 18:48.086
Wow. Niall.

18:48.128 --> 18:50.046
I mean, your whole team
is stacked like this.

18:50.088 --> 18:51.297
[ Laughing ]
It's crazy.

18:51.339 --> 18:52.882
You -- You have to only pick
three of six.

18:52.924 --> 18:54.551
Don't know how I'm going
to decide it,

18:54.592 --> 18:57.887
but all I can say is,
Huntley, it's just insane.

18:57.929 --> 19:00.473
I threw -- I don't know
if you guys know this phrase --

19:00.515 --> 19:01.683
a spanner in the works,

19:01.725 --> 19:03.184
but, like,
a wrench in the works.

19:03.226 --> 19:04.978
Is that, like,
how would you say?
A wrench? Yes.

19:05.020 --> 19:07.105
A wrench. We can --
Spanner is the same.

19:07.147 --> 19:08.398
Do the Irish version.

19:08.440 --> 19:09.441
We're going to
edit that out.

19:09.482 --> 19:11.234
[ Laughter ]

19:11.276 --> 19:13.695
I-I kind of threw a spanner
in the works with this song,

19:13.737 --> 19:16.906
but I wanted to see
if he would step up to a song

19:16.948 --> 19:18.658
that he wouldn't
necessarily pick.

19:18.700 --> 19:19.701
Wow, Huntley.

19:19.743 --> 19:21.077
Thank you.
That is some performance.

19:21.119 --> 19:22.579
First of all, that's the best
you've ever sung it.

19:22.620 --> 19:24.205
I gave it my all today, man.

19:24.247 --> 19:26.624
Everybody here loves you.
Everyone thinks you're amazing.

19:26.666 --> 19:28.209
And I know for a fact
that the people of America

19:28.251 --> 19:30.337
have just been falling in love
with you more and more.

19:30.378 --> 19:31.546
You're one of those people

19:31.588 --> 19:32.964
that's got something
to say to the world.

19:33.006 --> 19:35.050
And when you have a voice
like that,

19:35.091 --> 19:36.426
that's going to be
one hell of an album,

19:36.468 --> 19:37.469
and I'm going to buy it.

19:37.510 --> 19:39.387
Me, too.
Thank you guys so much.

19:39.429 --> 19:41.639
How about another big hand
for Huntley,

19:41.681 --> 19:43.391
ladies and gentlemen?
[ Cheers and applause ]

19:43.433 --> 19:44.642
Huntley sounds like an artist

19:44.684 --> 19:46.102
that should be
selling out arenas.

19:46.144 --> 19:47.937
He's so, so good.

19:47.979 --> 19:50.231
Team Niall has
some amazing artists on it...
Yeah.

19:50.273 --> 19:53.360
...and they're definitely
a threat going to the lives.

19:53.401 --> 19:56.404
He is so talented.
That dude is ridiculous.

19:56.446 --> 19:58.698
I'd definitely keep him.
Niall: I don't know
what to do.

19:58.740 --> 19:59.991
I think this is
the worst decision.

20:00.033 --> 20:02.243
Yeah, 'cause they're
the cream of the crop.

20:02.285 --> 20:03.328
Six to...
Three.

20:03.370 --> 20:04.412
Yeah.
That's hard.

20:04.454 --> 20:05.997
I know.

20:13.338 --> 20:14.506
* This is "The Voice" *

to the playoffs.

[ Laughs ]

20:23.890 --> 20:25.183
Alright, Niall,
tell us about the artist

20:25.225 --> 20:27.519
that you brought back
for your super save.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.521
Oh, I'm so glad
I've got a super save.

20:29.562 --> 20:31.564
The talent was so amazing
in the knockouts.

20:31.606 --> 20:34.067
So, for the playoffs,
we added a new twist.

20:34.109 --> 20:36.111
This artist
was just unbelievable.

20:36.152 --> 20:39.781
And I just couldn't lose
a voice that good that early.

20:39.823 --> 20:41.241
And I'm glad I have it.

20:41.282 --> 20:45.203
Each coach got to bring back
one artist from any team

20:45.245 --> 20:46.621
as a super save.

20:47.747 --> 20:49.916
Julia --
Are you record--
Stop it.

20:49.958 --> 20:52.210
Would you like
to go back to eighth grade,

20:52.252 --> 20:54.754
or would you like to come back
to "The Voice" on Team Niall?

20:54.796 --> 20:56.673
[ Crying ] Oh, my God.

20:56.715 --> 20:58.466
You were so good.
You deserve to go nowhere.

20:58.508 --> 21:00.218
If I had a save,
I would have used it.

21:00.260 --> 21:02.303
* Yeah, I'm unstoppable
toda-a-a-a-a... *

21:02.345 --> 21:04.514
Niall: What she did
in that knockout

21:04.556 --> 21:06.057
was nothing short
of incredible.

21:06.099 --> 21:07.851
* ...a-a-a-a-a-a-y *
* Unstoppable today *

21:07.892 --> 21:09.352
Niall: So the opportunity
to save one person

21:09.394 --> 21:11.062
from the whole show this year...
* Unstoppable *

21:11.104 --> 21:12.397
...was a game changer.
* Unstoppable today *

21:12.439 --> 21:13.648
And I had to bring Julia.

21:13.690 --> 21:15.191
We're going
to the playoffs, baby.

21:15.233 --> 21:16.401
Yes! [ Laughs ]

21:16.443 --> 21:17.652
I'll see you --
Team Niall slay!

21:17.694 --> 21:20.572
Team Niall slay!
I'll see you soon.

21:20.613 --> 21:22.782
Come on, Super Save.
Show us what you're made of.

21:22.824 --> 21:24.242
Super Save --
I like that name.

21:24.284 --> 21:26.244
When I got the call,
I thought Niall was AI.

21:26.286 --> 21:28.788
'Cause, like [chuckles]
you never know these days.

21:28.830 --> 21:30.707

Yeah.

I'm so thankful to be able
to work with Niall again.

21:35.795 --> 21:38.548
For me, that just says
that he believes in me.

21:38.590 --> 21:42.594
* You with the sad eyes *

21:42.635 --> 21:45.972
* Don't be discouraged *
The song that I will
be singing for playoffs

21:46.014 --> 21:47.766
is "True Colors"
by Cyndi Lauper.

21:47.807 --> 21:50.435
Being sent home gave me
a new perspective of this song,

21:50.477 --> 21:52.645
so I'm super excited
to sell the story

21:52.687 --> 21:54.272
that I'm just going to
come back stronger.
* Because you know
I'll be there *

21:54.314 --> 21:55.940
* I'll see your true colors
shining through *

21:55.982 --> 21:57.692
I definitely feel like
I have to prove myself.

21:57.734 --> 21:59.903
I have to top what I did,
because this is the song

21:59.944 --> 22:02.489
that could possibly
make me get to lives.

22:02.530 --> 22:03.823
It's so good.
Thank you.

22:03.865 --> 22:05.367
I think we need to just
watch out

22:05.408 --> 22:07.786
for where it gets busy
around the ends of the verses

22:07.827 --> 22:10.663
and, you know, like words,
like, "Though I realize,"

22:10.705 --> 22:12.457
and then bite "it."
Yeah.

22:12.499 --> 22:15.335
* Though I realize
it's... *
* Realize it's... *

Just, like, let it just...
[breathes sharply]
Mm-hmm.

22:17.087 --> 22:19.172
Let that fall away,
make it as small as possible,

22:19.214 --> 22:21.257
and nearly speak it,
but it feels really good.
[ Speaking indistinctly ]

22:21.299 --> 22:22.801
You should feel
really confident in this.
Yeah, I feel really good.

22:22.842 --> 22:24.302
This is something
that you can do

22:24.344 --> 22:26.471

to all the emotion

and then coming back.

so much growth from Julia.

To think that that girl
is 13 is mind-blowing.

22:33.687 --> 22:34.979

to show us her true colors

favorite voices on the show.

27:18.430 --> 27:21.516
She's an amazing person,
really bubbly character.

27:21.558 --> 27:22.642
But now I'm here.

27:22.684 --> 27:24.227
Maybe we can
get to sing together.

27:24.269 --> 27:25.478
I'm not singing with you.
You're too good.
Oh!

27:25.520 --> 27:28.106
And she just adds
to Team Niall perfectly.

27:28.148 --> 27:29.733
I'm so excited
we get to hear you sing

27:29.774 --> 27:31.609
this absolute monster
of a tune.

27:31.651 --> 27:34.237
I don't think a song
could suit me more perfectly.

27:34.279 --> 27:35.572
I'm singing
"You've Got the Love"

27:35.613 --> 27:38.283
by Florence + the Machine.

27:38.324 --> 27:41.119
* Sometimes I feel like throwing
my hands up in the air *
The message of this song
is so impactful

27:41.161 --> 27:44.497
because I'm literally feeling
every lyric...
* I know I can count on you *

27:44.539 --> 27:46.666
...like, to my core.

27:46.708 --> 27:48.209
* Sometimes I feel like saying,
"Lord, I just don't care" *
When my mom gave me the news

27:48.251 --> 27:50.211
they found more cancer,

27:50.253 --> 27:53.256
I kind of questioned the meaning
of life, to be honest.

27:53.298 --> 27:56.259
This song brought me
back to that moment.

27:57.052 --> 27:58.595
[ Chuckling ] Sorry.

27:58.636 --> 28:00.513
[ Voice breaking ]
Just what's the use in all this?

28:00.555 --> 28:02.807
* Time after time, I think,
"Oh, Lord, what's the use?" *

28:02.849 --> 28:05.518
But this journey has been

28:05.560 --> 28:08.271
the most incredible
blessing ever.

28:08.313 --> 28:10.857
She's seeing me
up on this big stage,

28:10.899 --> 28:12.233
just bringing the good news.

28:12.275 --> 28:15.153
And that literally
gives her, like, strength.

28:15.195 --> 28:16.571
That was so good.
[ Chuckles ]

28:16.613 --> 28:18.031
Wow.
Thank you.

28:18.073 --> 28:20.784
I think some melody changes
just to Mara-fy it.

28:20.825 --> 28:22.035
Oh, I like that.
Yeah.

28:22.077 --> 28:23.870
And then dynamics
is the only thing.

28:23.912 --> 28:25.497
Just go in nice
on the first verse.

28:25.538 --> 28:28.875
* Sometimes I feel like throwing
my hands up in the air *

28:28.917 --> 28:30.627
A little bit
throwaway, as well.

28:30.669 --> 28:34.172
* Sometimes I feel like saying,
"Lord, I just don't care" *

28:34.214 --> 28:35.507
Exactly like that.

28:35.548 --> 28:37.550
Okay.
And then...
* You got the love *

28:37.592 --> 28:39.678
* You got the love *
Niall: Mara reminds me
of Olivia Rodrigo.

28:39.719 --> 28:42.222
* You got the love *
She's got that big powerhouse
young pop voice.

28:42.263 --> 28:44.349
Be as intense
on the smaller bits.
Okay.

28:44.391 --> 28:47.060
Do you know that Mara
face crunch that you do?
How is it?

28:47.102 --> 28:50.188
I literally just took, like,
a screenshot in my head.
Take it. Go on.

28:50.230 --> 28:52.232
* Sometimes I feel like... *
She feels the lyrics.

28:52.273 --> 28:54.651
* ...throwing my hands
up in the air *
She's good at telling a story.

28:54.693 --> 28:56.569
* 'Cause I know... *
And I really want her
to attach all of that

28:56.611 --> 28:59.114
to this song in a big moment.
* I can count on you, oh *

28:59.155 --> 29:01.199
You are, like,
one in a million.

is going to be so hard.

the going is just too rough *

no matter what I do *

that life is just too much *

for Team Niall in the playoffs!

31:09.994 --> 31:11.538
So good!

31:11.579 --> 31:14.290
Mara, great job.
So fun to watch.

31:14.332 --> 31:15.625
It's such
a great night of music.

31:15.667 --> 31:17.627
Let's go to your former coach,
John Legend.

31:17.669 --> 31:22.382
Tapping into that falsetto
finesse was a real revelation

31:22.424 --> 31:25.093
because I think people saw
a different side of your voice,

31:25.135 --> 31:28.096
and it just gave you
that much more character.

31:28.138 --> 31:30.390
This was your best moment
so far on this show,

31:30.432 --> 31:32.559
other than singing a duet
with me at the beginning.

31:32.600 --> 31:34.227
That was --
That was awful!

roller coaster of excitement

31:40.734 --> 31:41.818

are so good.

What I love most about you
is just you're so you.

I just think that
you're an amazing star already.

31:53.997 --> 31:56.833
And I really think it's
a no-brainer to go to the lives.

31:56.875 --> 31:59.836
I mean, you have what it takes
to be a live performer.

31:59.878 --> 32:01.421
It's amazing.

a lot tonight.

Mara's performance.

32:10.555 --> 32:12.724
You know, we had a great chat
about making the verses

32:12.766 --> 32:15.435
and the outro of the song
really small and tender.

32:15.477 --> 32:18.480
And I thought you did it
unbelievably well today.

32:18.521 --> 32:20.231
And I don't want to say
I told you so,

that I get to be here.

to sell a song

33:07.612 --> 33:09.364

33:09.406 --> 33:11.282
She reminds me so much of stuff
I grew up on.

33:11.324 --> 33:13.743
So, to hear a nostalgic tone
like Alexa's

33:13.785 --> 33:16.246
is something so refreshing that
we need in the music industry.

33:16.287 --> 33:17.580
This is honestly
one of my favorite songs.

Oh, my God.

33:19.916 --> 33:22.794

grandmother's memorial service.

33:22.836 --> 33:23.586
No way.
Yeah.

33:23.628 --> 33:24.963

when she was passing.

* You'll remember me *

to my grandmother was

33:32.929 --> 33:35.265
one of the most sacred
and powerful experiences

there was this absolutely
golden sunset.

* ...walked
in fields of gold *

33:48.987 --> 33:50.905
If my grandmother knew
that I was on "The Voice,"

33:50.947 --> 33:54.367
she would be
insanely proud of me.

33:54.409 --> 33:56.327
My grandmother,
she was definitely a realist,

33:56.369 --> 33:57.704
and I'm kind of a dreamer,

33:57.746 --> 34:01.332

that I could do this.

34:06.880 --> 34:08.840
is a perfect song for Alexa
because it really tells a story,

what the song's about,

37:37.173 --> 37:39.175
Ooh, Alexa, that was
a great performance.

37:39.217 --> 37:40.677
I love your voice.

37:40.719 --> 37:42.387
I heard every word
you were singing.
Thank you.

37:42.429 --> 37:46.099
Mama was a big stickler
on enunciations.
Yeah. [ Laughs ]

You have made it extra hard
for our buddy over here

trying to make a decision.

37:51.479 --> 37:52.981
Daly: Thank you, Reba.
Thank you.

37:53.023 --> 37:56.276
John?
No one else is like you
in this competition.

37:56.317 --> 37:59.821
That would be an interesting way
to form a team with somebody

37:59.863 --> 38:03.408
that's so distinct and executes
it so well, like you do.

38:03.450 --> 38:05.785
Thank you so much, John.

38:05.827 --> 38:07.495
Alright, Niall,
give us some thoughts, buddy.

Hi, Niall. [ Laughs ]
You bleed emotion
and authenticity.

38:12.250 --> 38:17.672
It's been so good to watch you
amongst all the big belters.
Mm.

38:17.714 --> 38:19.174
And that's
the biggest compliment

38:19.215 --> 38:21.259
that I can give you
because you stand out, I think.

38:21.301 --> 38:24.346
This girl
is ridiculously talented,

38:24.387 --> 38:27.140
and the world will see it
at some point.
Thank you.

for Alexa Wildish,

38:29.225 --> 38:30.602

[ Cheers and applause ]

38:30.643 --> 38:32.896
Alexa is
one of my favorites.

38:32.937 --> 38:35.273
She's a pro
behind that microphone.

38:35.315 --> 38:36.816
She's a great storyteller.

38:36.858 --> 38:38.193
After hearing
all this amazing talent,

38:38.234 --> 38:40.278
I'm sure glad
it's not my job to choose

38:40.320 --> 38:42.197
which three have to go home.

38:42.238 --> 38:43.239
That's tough.

No more stalling, Niall.

This is it.
Decision time.

Julia, Mara, and Nini.

Only three can
represent Coach Niall

Niall, how are you feeling?

39:15.897 --> 39:17.816
Scared.

39:17.857 --> 39:21.403
To turn six to three
is just crazy to me.

39:21.444 --> 39:24.906
I have enjoyed working
with all of you so much.

39:24.948 --> 39:26.741
We see a lot of great singers,
but I think we've got

a lot of great artists,
especially on this team.

Huntley's got such
an individual tone in his voice.

40:00.233 --> 40:02.777
He's a machine onstage,
unbelievable performer.

40:02.819 --> 40:04.279
I appreciate it.
Thank you guys so much.

40:04.320 --> 40:06.114
There's not many voices
like his,

40:06.156 --> 40:09.242

in our industry.

Nini, moving on
to the top 12!

for the live shows
