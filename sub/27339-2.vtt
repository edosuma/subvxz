IF YOU WAITED
A LITTLE BIT LONGER --

38:48.026 --> 38:50.643
THEY WOULD PREFER
LIKE A YEAR AND A HALF --

38:50.678 --> 38:52.395
THINGS WILL COME OUT BETTER
FOR YOU BECAUSE --

38:52.447 --> 38:55.231
IT'S ALMOST LIKE WHOEVER
WOULD BE WORKING ON YOU,

38:55.283 --> 38:57.183
THEY WOULD HELP YOU
IN A BETTER WAY.

38:57.219 --> 39:00.503
IT'S JUST NOT A GREAT TIME,
COSMICALLY.

39:00.539 --> 39:03.089
AND WE'RE IN FOUR
PLANETARY RETROGRADES.

39:03.125 --> 39:04.607
SO WHEN THE PLANETS
MOVE A DIFFERENT WAY

39:04.643 --> 39:06.142
THAN WE'RE USED TO,

39:06.178 --> 39:07.510
IT AFFECTS US
PHYSICALLY, MENTALLY,

39:07.546 --> 39:09.245
EMOTIONALLY,
AND SPIRITUALLY.

39:09.281 --> 39:10.714
YOUR GUIDES
ARE SAYING, LIKE,

39:10.749 --> 39:12.749
WHATEVER YOU GOT GOING ON
WITH THIS PROCEDURE --

39:12.784 --> 39:14.050
SURGERY, SOMETHING --

39:14.086 --> 39:15.468
REALLY LOOK INTO IT

39:15.504 --> 39:17.554
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT REALLY
SUPPOSED TO DO TOO MANY THINGS

39:17.589 --> 39:20.006
DURING A TIME
OF A RETROGRADE.

39:20.041 --> 39:21.591
THE SECOND JOLIE SAYS THAT

39:21.643 --> 39:23.777
I SHOULD TRY TO PUSH
BACK THE SURGERY,

39:23.812 --> 39:26.229
MY HEART DROPS
TO MY STOMACH.

39:26.264 --> 39:27.514
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT TO THINK.

39:27.549 --> 39:29.215
LIKE, THAT FREAKS ME OUT
A LITTLE BIT.

39:29.251 --> 39:32.302
I FEEL LIKE IT'S KIND OF
TOO LATE ALREADY, THOUGH.

39:32.337 --> 39:33.536
LIKE, THE SURGERY --

39:33.572 --> 39:35.638
WE'VE BEEN PLANNING IT
FOR SO MANY MONTHS,

39:35.674 --> 39:37.407
AND IT'S COMING SOON.

39:37.442 --> 39:40.343
WE HAVE A SURGEON, LIKE,
FLYING IN FROM CALIFORNIA

39:40.379 --> 39:42.679
TO COME TO NEW YORK,
AND...

39:44.049 --> 39:46.383
SO, YOUR GUIDES ARE
TELLING YOU RIGHT NOW,

39:46.418 --> 39:49.052
LIKE, THEY'RE GONNA BE
WITH YOU.

39:49.087 --> 39:50.320
BUT WHEN YOU GO IN
FOR YOUR SURGERY,

39:50.355 --> 39:52.222
ASK THEM TO BE PRESENT
WITH YOU AND THE DOCTOR

39:52.257 --> 39:54.908
SO, THIS WAY,
THEY CAN DO RIGHT BY YOU.

39:54.943 --> 39:57.060
I'VE BEEN SO EXCITED
FOR THIS SURGERY.

39:57.095 --> 39:58.561
THIS IS A HUGE CHANGE
IN MY LIFE.

39:58.597 --> 40:02.065

I AM JUST LIKE,

40:02.100 --> 40:04.534
"OH, GOD, IS THERE GONNA
BE A COMPLICATION?

40:04.569 --> 40:06.136
IS SOMETHING GONNA GO WRONG?"

40:06.171 --> 40:08.338
I'M GONNA TELL MYSELF
THAT IT WILL GO PERFECTLY,

MAY BE IN THE BACK OF MY HEAD,
