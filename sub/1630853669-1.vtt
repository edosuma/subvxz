24:25.639 --> 24:27.573

figure out the rest.

24:58.265 --> 24:59.231
You've doubled up.

25:04.678 --> 25:05.578

But if you want them
bitches in there to live,

25:37.678 --> 25:38.303

31:44.407 --> 31:45.670

31:45.705 --> 31:47.705

32:17.110 --> 32:18.604
and that 30 show can make 100.

32:22.379 --> 32:23.213

40:15.687 --> 40:16.554
Vulture packs.

40:18.888 --> 40:20.888
I see they even got
they own slogan.

40:22.760 --> 40:24.562
Vulture packs.

40:24.597 --> 40:27.191
- Please don't,
please don't do this.

40:27.226 --> 40:28.533
- The only way to fly.

40:31.736 --> 40:34.539
I'm gonna make sure both of
y'alls get y'all wings today.

41:10.643 --> 41:12.775
- That nigga ain't
loyal to nobody.

41:12.810 --> 41:13.809
He weak.

41:15.879 --> 41:19.617
Let a young bitch take him
completely off his square.

41:19.652 --> 41:22.851
I told his ass, we
don't kill the folks,

41:22.886 --> 41:25.524
and we damn sure don't
fuck over nigga's family.

41:29.728 --> 41:32.729
He did both when he
pulled that shit on you.

41:32.764 --> 41:34.566
- You was with him
on that bullshit.

41:34.601 --> 41:36.128
- Prove it, nigga.

41:36.163 --> 41:37.998
I'm one of Chief's finest.

41:38.033 --> 41:41.067
I kill ops, not the folks.

41:42.675 --> 41:46.006
True enough, I trust him with
my life on too many moves.

41:47.240 --> 41:49.680
Had me in a ambush
with the Mexicans.

41:49.715 --> 41:51.308
He didn't give a
fuck how I felt.

41:52.751 --> 41:55.345
You think I'll be over here
pouring out information,

41:55.380 --> 41:57.688
like y'all don't
got shit else to do.

41:57.723 --> 41:59.283
No, I want what's mine.

42:00.693 --> 42:02.055
And that nigga got it.

42:03.025 --> 42:04.255
- He got it, huh?

42:06.226 --> 42:08.094
- We staying for 30
pounds of heroin.

42:09.295 --> 42:11.097
I put in the most
work on that move.

42:12.265 --> 42:13.935
To leave with a
pound of 10 bands

42:13.970 --> 42:15.607
like I'm a motherfucking worker.

42:15.642 --> 42:16.267
- How I know,

42:18.007 --> 42:20.205
you ain't one of them niggas
that killed my people?

42:21.175 --> 42:22.647
And just trying to set up a move

42:22.682 --> 42:24.077
to have me buried next to my BM?

42:26.411 --> 42:29.984
- 'Cause I done already
knocked off this bitch.

42:54.912 --> 42:56.648
She was named dropping.

42:56.683 --> 42:58.980
Holding too much information.

42:59.015 --> 43:01.686
Fucked around with a
turned state witness.

43:01.721 --> 43:04.249
So I put a bullet in the bitch.

43:04.284 --> 43:06.625
I just made sure I
fucked her first.

43:07.727 --> 43:08.660
Nigga was too pussy whipped

43:08.695 --> 43:11.355
to address what I told
him the problem was,

43:12.765 --> 43:14.798
so I handled that
shit accordingly.

43:14.833 --> 43:18.736
You don't gotta with me
a day in life after this.

43:18.771 --> 43:21.002
I'm telling you how
to get your get back.

43:22.907 --> 43:25.402
You won't find a
more reliable source.

43:25.437 --> 43:27.173
This from the horse's mouth.

43:28.715 --> 43:31.177
You could take it
or you can leave.

43:31.212 --> 43:32.409
- I want his location.

43:32.444 --> 43:34.686

location and a warehouse.

43:41.189 --> 43:43.728
You just hit me
once you come up.

43:49.769 --> 43:51.362
- How about we lay
your ass down right now

43:51.397 --> 43:52.836
for being suspect?

43:54.070 --> 43:55.971
And I'll find that
warehouse myself.

43:57.403 --> 43:59.007
- Sound like two for one to me.

44:02.408 --> 44:04.881
- Your mama still live
on Woodlawn, nigga?

44:17.863 --> 44:20.094
You need to check up
on her more often.

44:20.129 --> 44:23.735
I ain't playing no stupid
game to win no stupid prize.

44:26.971 --> 44:28.135
I'm bringing you sugar.

44:29.303 --> 44:31.809
Don't return a favor
by handing me no shit.

44:32.779 --> 44:37.012
We can get money, or
we can get greasy.

44:42.184 --> 44:44.481
- 50 bands off the
vault in that warehouse.

44:47.992 --> 44:49.222
How much in there?

44:51.028 --> 44:52.093
- Close to a million.

45:10.982 --> 45:14.412
- Yo nigga socked you
up pretty bad, huh?

45:17.417 --> 45:18.218
Where you from?

45:20.486 --> 45:21.320
- Dad,

45:26.899 --> 45:28.426
is mom coming back?

45:30.397 --> 45:31.836
- I don't know.

45:35.105 --> 45:37.204
But you ain't gonna
lose no sleep over it.

45:44.213 --> 45:48.380
Same routine, same
responsibilities, same curfew.

45:52.859 --> 45:54.518
Now you hold your head up.

45:54.553 --> 45:55.586
Whatever crying you gonna do,

45:55.621 --> 45:58.027
you gonna squeeze that
shit up out you right now.

46:11.944 --> 46:13.405
- Look,

46:13.440 --> 46:14.945
listen,

46:14.980 --> 46:15.814
learn.

46:18.247 --> 46:20.445
- There's a lesson in
everything you encounter,

46:22.416 --> 46:24.922
but nothing in life is
gonna teach you like love.

46:27.025 --> 46:30.587
It's gonna give you the biggest
smile and the worst pain.

46:30.622 --> 46:32.622
It's good to experience it now,

46:32.657 --> 46:35.163
instead of having it
shell shock you later on.

46:37.299 --> 46:39.970
But one thing I don't want
you getting accustomed to,

46:41.534 --> 46:44.238
and that's living in mystery
over some God damn woman.

46:47.573 --> 46:49.639
It's all right to love,

46:49.674 --> 46:51.916
but when love causes
you to lose yourself,

46:51.951 --> 46:53.214
you better let that bitch go.

46:55.152 --> 46:57.020
And I don't care who she is.

46:58.287 --> 47:00.287
Do we have an understanding?

47:02.192 --> 47:03.026
- Yes sir.

47:05.690 --> 47:07.932
- I'll be picking
you up from school.

47:09.067 --> 47:10.297
You got your cell phone?

47:11.498 --> 47:12.130
- Yes.

47:14.138 --> 47:16.633
- Make sure it's off in class.

47:16.668 --> 47:19.603
Power on at- 15,
I'll be texting you.

47:20.672 --> 47:21.880
- All right.

47:22.982 --> 47:24.311
- Bring it here.

47:33.421 --> 47:34.387
Go on upstairs.

47:34.422 --> 47:35.289
Get ready for tomorrow.

47:35.324 --> 47:36.587
Watch your step.

48:02.989 --> 48:05.286
- My clients come from all over.

48:05.321 --> 48:06.958
Japan,

48:06.993 --> 48:08.454
Bangladesh,

48:08.489 --> 48:10.060
South Africa,

48:10.095 --> 48:10.929
Sudan.

48:12.592 --> 48:15.032
They receive a five
star experience

48:15.067 --> 48:18.002
from a McCarran
Airport to our hotel.

48:18.037 --> 48:21.665
Most of the Johns, they
pick up their favorite girl,

48:21.700 --> 48:25.977
then they go to the strip
club, then the pot dealer.

48:26.012 --> 48:27.605
But my exclusives,

48:27.640 --> 48:31.741
they want cane,
powder, and pills,

48:31.776 --> 48:34.678
and their fair share
of pussy.

48:34.713 --> 48:37.054
Rich, powerful men,

48:37.089 --> 48:38.957
and it all boils down to pussy.

48:40.125 --> 48:42.092
You put a cute girl on their arm

48:42.127 --> 48:43.962
and they're willing
to spend it all.

48:48.034 --> 48:48.967
You'd do great there.

48:50.366 --> 48:54.071
- Jake, managing your father's
bank is enough for me.

48:55.239 --> 48:57.404
- By enough, you mean
earning a salary?

48:58.704 --> 49:02.112
Honey, you haven't seen bank

49:03.247 --> 49:07.117
until you play in a
circle of billionaires.

49:08.714 --> 49:09.548
Think about it.

49:16.788 --> 49:18.557
How much longer on your friend?

49:20.198 --> 49:22.165
- She's on the elevator.

49:22.200 --> 49:23.034
- Splendid.

49:25.203 --> 49:26.103
- The door.

49:36.676 --> 49:38.148
Jake, she's here.

49:40.284 --> 49:41.679
- Well, whoopdie-fucking-do.

49:44.387 --> 49:45.815
You always show up to
your business meetings

49:45.850 --> 49:46.649
30 minutes late?

49:46.684 --> 49:48.323
- You wanted the
best in the city.

49:50.822 --> 49:52.723
- Best things come
with a little wait.

49:54.463 --> 49:56.496
Or I could have had you
to pull up in Murder Town

49:56.531 --> 49:59.037
and met with one of
the other workers.

50:05.441 --> 50:07.177
- Murder Town.

50:07.212 --> 50:08.739
No, that wouldn't work.

50:08.774 --> 50:10.576
I mean, I'm not from Chicago,

50:10.611 --> 50:13.150
but I know I don't want to
be going to Murder Town.

50:14.318 --> 50:16.318
If you got some of that
stuff from yesterday,

50:16.353 --> 50:17.484
come on, show it to me.

50:17.519 --> 50:18.353
Let's go.

50:20.192 --> 50:23.127
Mike, this is, uh.

50:23.162 --> 50:24.656
- Call me, Tiff.

50:26.528 --> 50:28.066
- Come on ladies, sit down.

50:39.904 --> 50:42.377
And this is the same from
the little bird on the bag

50:42.412 --> 50:44.577
that I snorted yesterday?

50:44.612 --> 50:46.183
- Straight from the source.

50:53.819 --> 50:56.127
- That's 25,000 in your hand.

50:58.626 --> 51:03.530
- Mike, get the 25,000 out
of the bag next to the bed.

51:09.670 --> 51:10.537
Today, Mike.

51:28.755 --> 51:32.163
This is 25,000 hand
over fist, okay?

51:36.400 --> 51:39.500
And this package, this'll
be traveling with me.

51:41.636 --> 51:43.636
I don't deal with narcotics,

51:43.671 --> 51:46.474
but having quantities
like this is paramount.

51:48.313 --> 51:51.611
I have patrons and I
need to keep them happy.

51:51.646 --> 51:52.579
- Where at?

51:52.614 --> 51:53.712
- Fabulous Las Vegas, of course.

51:55.914 --> 51:58.189
- That's over 2000 miles away.

51:59.357 --> 52:00.851
- Honey, we're
not talking miles.

52:00.886 --> 52:01.885
We're talking money.

52:14.273 --> 52:16.339
- Keisha's gonna
give you my number.

52:17.672 --> 52:19.474
So I'm gonna talk to the team.

52:22.875 --> 52:23.874
Thanks for the plug.

52:34.425 --> 52:35.919
- This is some real boss shit.

52:44.600 --> 52:45.731
Motherfucker, think you gonna-

52:45.766 --> 52:46.930
- I think
you broke my nose!

52:46.965 --> 52:47.764
Broke out of my house!

52:47.799 --> 52:49.570
Don't kick me out!

52:49.605 --> 52:50.604
Bitch, quit your shit, G!

52:50.639 --> 52:51.572
- Come on, mama.

52:51.607 --> 52:53.640
- Get the fuck out my house, G.

52:53.675 --> 52:55.873
You think this shit
make you responsible?

52:55.908 --> 52:59.250
Or make .

53:01.287 --> 53:02.847
- Hey, hey, on that car, gang.

53:19.305 --> 53:23.307
- Nigga, almost put this
whole clip in this bitch.

53:26.411 --> 53:28.004
- You must got good
life insurance, nigga.

53:28.039 --> 53:29.742
- Nah, it ain't
even that, big bro.

53:29.777 --> 53:31.282
It's we into it right now.

53:33.418 --> 53:35.385
- And you still ain't
getting no money.

53:36.080 --> 53:38.047
- Shit, you know how that go.

53:38.082 --> 53:40.016
PPP done shut everything down.

53:40.051 --> 53:42.986
We out here hitting cars
and knocking over stores.

53:46.090 --> 53:48.629
Big Bitch Betsy gonna
make sure I eat though,

53:48.664 --> 53:49.498
by any means.

53:55.099 --> 53:57.374
- You wanna make
some real money?

53:57.409 --> 53:58.441
- Fuck yeah, nigga.

54:00.104 --> 54:01.840
- Grab a couple of them
that you fuck with.

54:01.875 --> 54:02.973
Y'all hop in the back.

54:06.814 --> 54:08.748
- You know we got
these blicks on us.

54:11.786 --> 54:13.522
- Bring her with you.

55:10.548 --> 55:11.976
- And come on, y'all.

55:12.011 --> 55:14.847
I need at least 2000 damn
bags by the end of this shift.

55:14.882 --> 55:15.947
- Yo, what is y'all doing?

55:15.982 --> 55:17.388
We need to speed it up.

55:17.423 --> 55:18.554
We gotta a line and
more cars pulling up.

55:18.589 --> 55:19.984
- If you want
something done right,

55:20.019 --> 55:21.491
you should do it yourself then.

55:21.526 --> 55:22.085
- Up with all that?

55:22.120 --> 55:23.186
- Y'all heard that man.

55:23.221 --> 55:24.956
Melo, take your way outside
and secure the alley.

55:24.991 --> 55:26.155
- I ain't got no pistol, man.

55:26.190 --> 55:27.596
- Tell TY he relieved
and grab his gun.

55:27.631 --> 55:29.125
I'll be out there in a minute.

55:37.003 --> 55:40.510
- Aye yo, Ty, you
can spin off, G.

55:40.545 --> 55:41.775
- Y'all always need
to speed it up.

55:41.810 --> 55:43.040
Y'all ain't moving fast enough.

55:43.075 --> 55:44.140
- I know, man.

55:45.209 --> 55:46.417
Let's go, y'all.

55:51.116 --> 55:51.950
- Aye yo, Ty.

55:52.920 --> 55:54.150
The fuck is wrong with you?

56:00.565 --> 56:01.124
- Get down!

56:05.537 --> 56:06.470
- It's cool.

56:06.505 --> 56:07.405
Don't move.

57:04.596 --> 57:05.595
- Somebody help this man!

57:05.630 --> 57:06.530
Hey, hey, hey.

57:06.565 --> 57:07.630
Somebody help, somebody help!

57:24.011 --> 57:25.483
- Cedric thanks you.

57:33.086 --> 57:35.119
- Pops was the only
father figure I knew.

57:37.189 --> 57:38.661
- You know, it's
been so many years

57:38.696 --> 57:40.256
since I've seen any
of you young men

57:40.291 --> 57:41.994
from the community center.

57:44.966 --> 57:47.703
Besides those that
turned into my children.

57:52.039 --> 57:55.546
Ever since law enforcement
swept through our neighborhoods,

57:56.340 --> 57:58.615
we lost the glue and structure

57:59.915 --> 58:01.750
that made us a good community.

58:04.623 --> 58:06.557
Our vision was in place.

58:06.592 --> 58:08.020
Our direction was set.

58:09.188 --> 58:11.826
Cedric, myself and
so many others,

58:11.861 --> 58:13.597
there was hundreds of us.

58:15.194 --> 58:17.865
We were determined
to erase the stain

58:17.900 --> 58:20.065
that crack inflicted
on our community.

58:21.706 --> 58:24.333
But we were not prepared
to face the government

58:24.368 --> 58:25.906
that wanted to keep us there.

58:29.307 --> 58:31.945
We were on the brink
of a mass incarceration

58:31.980 --> 58:35.652
that caused more detriment
to our families than ever.

58:49.327 --> 58:50.931
But worse is,

58:52.396 --> 58:56.002
those of you who knew the
guidelines to our recovery

58:57.676 --> 59:00.578
and didn't fulfill the
commitment to become leaders.

59:02.681 --> 59:05.682
The leaders that
our organization so
desperately needed.

59:15.419 --> 59:18.156
- I was 17 when them
indictments took place,

59:20.732 --> 59:23.227
and not all of us had
leadership capabilities.

59:28.740 --> 59:29.970
Think about most of our members

59:30.005 --> 59:33.171
coming from broken
homes and shit.

59:33.206 --> 59:34.777
We looked up to the guys.

59:36.440 --> 59:37.912
When pops went down,

59:39.410 --> 59:42.213
I ain't had nothing my
mind but trying to survive.

59:44.316 --> 59:45.215
And becoming a father,

59:48.353 --> 59:51.090
made me put a bigger
priority on survival.

59:51.125 --> 59:52.696
- By committing the same acts

59:52.731 --> 59:55.633
that has my husband doing
life in the institution?

59:57.802 --> 59:58.933
- Fucking snake, man.

59:58.968 --> 1:00:00.231
- That's what I'm saying, man.

1:00:00.266 --> 1:00:01.067
- You already know.

1:00:02.334 --> 1:00:03.102
- Aye man, somebody
at your door, man.

1:00:03.137 --> 1:00:04.840
- Man, fuck that.

1:00:06.140 --> 1:00:08.041
- Put your hands up!
- Get on the ground!

1:00:08.076 --> 1:00:09.779
- Get down!
- Down!

1:00:19.285 --> 1:00:20.284
- 15 Years ago,

1:00:20.320 --> 1:00:24.057
Cedric spent every
conversation mentioning you.

1:00:25.764 --> 1:00:27.764
I had forgotten who you
were until recently.

1:00:29.196 --> 1:00:30.329
Now I recall,

1:00:32.133 --> 1:00:34.870
you the young kid that he
allowed to live in our attic.

1:00:47.918 --> 1:00:49.819
- My moms had drug problems.

1:00:49.854 --> 1:00:52.415
- I remember him spending
several hours with you

1:00:52.450 --> 1:00:55.286
in that attic, teaching
you the literature.

1:00:58.863 --> 1:01:01.831
The positive dignified
principles of growth
and development.

1:01:02.933 --> 1:01:04.328
- Why you call me over here?

1:01:06.871 --> 1:01:08.068
I mean, everybody dead.

1:01:10.501 --> 1:01:11.709
I pay my hommage,

1:01:13.977 --> 1:01:15.504
and I don't see none of
these out in the street

1:01:15.539 --> 1:01:18.045
taking initiative to
send a old man no money.

1:01:19.477 --> 1:01:21.081
Not a dime.

1:01:21.116 --> 1:01:22.214
- We don't want your money.

1:01:22.249 --> 1:01:23.721
- Well, all right then.

1:01:25.956 --> 1:01:26.955
Get your coat, man.

1:01:28.552 --> 1:01:29.991
Send my love to him.

1:01:30.026 --> 1:01:31.487
- We want your involvement.

1:01:35.427 --> 1:01:36.998
You have influence.

1:01:38.298 --> 1:01:40.364
You have the knowledge
and the ability

1:01:40.399 --> 1:01:43.367
to continue this mission
that is far from over.

1:01:45.811 --> 1:01:47.173
Look at the men who follow you.

1:01:48.847 --> 1:01:51.144
They follow because
of what you know

1:01:51.179 --> 1:01:52.409
and what you're
able to accomplish.

1:01:52.444 --> 1:01:54.114
- I got accomplished
being a single father

1:01:54.149 --> 1:01:56.149
to a eight year boy.

1:01:56.184 --> 1:01:58.052
My time to try to
influence a bunch of niggas

1:01:58.087 --> 1:01:59.790
to see a better way
is the quickest way

1:01:59.825 --> 1:02:01.253
for me to end up
in a penitentiary.

1:02:02.421 --> 1:02:05.389
Just like pops and the
rest of them old heads.

1:02:05.424 --> 1:02:07.292
- If the streets
don't kill you first.

1:02:07.327 --> 1:02:09.228
- We all got a out
date, now don't we?

1:02:11.034 --> 1:02:12.198
- Try telling him that.

1:02:14.939 --> 1:02:17.137
What's his future without you?

1:02:17.172 --> 1:02:18.809
Who does he have?

1:02:18.844 --> 1:02:22.208
As a father, you're not in
a position to be selfish.

1:02:22.243 --> 1:02:25.310
- But I'm in a good position
to be smart now, ain't I?

1:02:35.586 --> 1:02:37.223
- Very well then.

1:03:02.250 --> 1:03:03.150
- Yeah.

1:03:03.185 --> 1:03:04.481
- I got cash for you, bro.

1:03:07.926 --> 1:03:10.454
- I gotta go to Stash house
and grab a few things.

1:03:10.489 --> 1:03:12.126
Maybe you can meet me over.

1:03:12.161 --> 1:03:14.095
- And I got a buzz
to put in your ear.

1:03:14.130 --> 1:03:15.360
- All right.

1:03:15.395 --> 1:03:16.592
- About a new
business opportunity.

1:03:16.627 --> 1:03:19.001
- Aight, shit, listen.

1:03:38.154 --> 1:03:42.222
- Stop disrespecting
me, stop disrespecting me,

1:03:42.257 --> 1:03:44.356
stop disrespecting!

1:03:44.391 --> 1:03:46.655
You will stop disrespecting me!

1:03:46.690 --> 1:03:49.493
You will stop disrespecting me!

1:03:49.528 --> 1:03:51.363
I didn't do it to you!

1:04:13.959 --> 1:04:15.057
- Where K at?

1:04:17.490 --> 1:04:20.458
She done left the crib a long
time ago and never came back.

1:04:24.970 --> 1:04:26.970
- You know Kayla
don't fuck with me.

1:04:30.602 --> 1:04:31.942
Last time I seen her,

1:04:33.341 --> 1:04:35.605
she was picking up my
baby from the hospital.

1:04:37.015 --> 1:04:40.115
Boy, you know you look
just like your granddaddy,

1:04:40.150 --> 1:04:41.578
just like him,

1:04:41.613 --> 1:04:42.779
with a little bit of
your daddy in there, too.

1:04:42.814 --> 1:04:44.955
- You know, I find it funny
that she been gone all this time

1:04:44.990 --> 1:04:46.451
and ain't paid
you not one visit.

1:04:48.521 --> 1:04:51.291
That shit don't even
surprise me though.

1:04:51.326 --> 1:04:54.327
She'd ran off and left only
child just like you left her.

1:04:56.166 --> 1:04:59.662
Whole rotten ass apples don't
fall too far from the tree.

1:04:59.697 --> 1:05:00.938
- Rotten apples?

1:05:02.304 --> 1:05:03.468
You got a lot of nerve.

1:05:04.438 --> 1:05:05.635
You do not know my struggle

1:05:05.670 --> 1:05:07.373
and you definitely
don't know my pain.

1:05:07.408 --> 1:05:08.704
- I don't know about
you running behind

1:05:08.739 --> 1:05:09.838
all the more dirty ass hustlers

1:05:09.874 --> 1:05:12.015
to the point where you
allowed them to take advantage

1:05:12.050 --> 1:05:13.412
of your only God damn daughter.

1:05:18.749 --> 1:05:20.089
- You don't know shit!

1:05:21.257 --> 1:05:23.356
Get your mother,
this motherfucker!

1:05:39.110 --> 1:05:41.143
I tried to raise Kayla
the best I could.

1:05:44.214 --> 1:05:46.676
By myself, me.

1:05:49.186 --> 1:05:50.416
I couldn't save her.

1:05:53.058 --> 1:05:54.750
Shit, I couldn't
even save myself.

1:06:04.399 --> 1:06:08.071
My baby has so much talent.

1:06:08.106 --> 1:06:10.370
She could sing, she could dance.

1:06:19.777 --> 1:06:20.611
Smart.

1:06:30.194 --> 1:06:32.491
I couldn't give her her dreams

1:06:32.526 --> 1:06:34.427
when I was living
in my own nightmare.

1:06:38.565 --> 1:06:40.598
So I had to give her up.

1:06:44.340 --> 1:06:46.538
So I guess that's why
she ended up with you.

1:06:51.809 --> 1:06:54.810
And then she told
me she was pregnant,

1:06:54.845 --> 1:06:57.087
and I was happy for her.

1:06:57.122 --> 1:06:58.154
'Cause she was happy.

1:07:03.161 --> 1:07:05.656
So if came over
here to judge me,

1:07:08.892 --> 1:07:10.595
you picked the
wrong day to do it.

1:07:12.764 --> 1:07:14.566
- I came over here
to make a discovery.

1:07:16.603 --> 1:07:18.636
Maliq need to be in
tune with his family.

1:07:20.310 --> 1:07:21.837
Least the little bit he do got.

1:07:23.148 --> 1:07:24.576
Especially his grandma.

1:07:26.481 --> 1:07:28.250
Now I know you over
here fucked up,

1:07:29.781 --> 1:07:30.879
but it ain't my
place to deprive him

1:07:30.914 --> 1:07:33.222
of a relationship
he should have.

1:07:36.293 --> 1:07:38.326
There's enough shit
going on already.

1:07:40.891 --> 1:07:43.694
You wanna spend some
time with your grandma?

1:07:43.729 --> 1:07:44.563
- Yeah.

1:07:50.241 --> 1:07:52.769
- Make sure you put some
food in your refrigerator.

1:07:54.344 --> 1:07:56.377
I'm gonna come back over
and pick him up later.

1:08:13.396 --> 1:08:15.231
- Of the heaviest
stuff really getting going.

1:08:15.266 --> 1:08:16.463
Now through midnight,

1:08:16.498 --> 1:08:17.860
we could have some
heavy bands of snow,

1:08:17.895 --> 1:08:19.301
especially for areas near-

1:08:23.406 --> 1:08:26.242
- I was instructed to
make sure you received it.

1:08:26.277 --> 1:08:28.805
If you have any love for my
husband, you'll hear him out.

1:08:28.840 --> 1:08:30.180
- From the north,

1:08:30.215 --> 1:08:31.676
moisture coming
in from the south.

1:08:31.711 --> 1:08:34.184
That's why we're just
at the beginning stages

1:08:34.219 --> 1:08:36.483
of this snow storm, another
storm warning in effect.

1:08:36.518 --> 1:08:38.716
Let's talk about what you can
expect for the next six hours

1:08:38.751 --> 1:08:40.586
when we expect some of
the heavy stuff to fall.

1:08:40.621 --> 1:08:41.818
Here's Rob-

1:08:41.853 --> 1:08:44.227
- It's been 20 long
years since we spoke.

1:08:48.266 --> 1:08:52.334
The chaos that has the streets
of Chicago in a hellish state

1:08:52.369 --> 1:08:54.600
is a direct result
of our actions.

1:08:56.505 --> 1:08:57.702
- Gonna
change direction,

1:08:57.737 --> 1:08:59.242
become more of a
west or northwest-

1:09:02.676 --> 1:09:05.281
- It's the offspring
from the life we live,

1:09:06.482 --> 1:09:10.187
reproduced on the same
blocks that we govern.

1:09:16.492 --> 1:09:18.393
So much of that blood
is on our hands.

1:09:25.534 --> 1:09:26.764
- Now.
- Mm-hm.

1:09:28.339 --> 1:09:29.239
Now that's gangsta.

1:09:37.942 --> 1:09:39.282
- Yeah.
- Say less.

1:09:43.046 --> 1:09:45.618
- We headed to
the warehouse right now.

1:09:45.653 --> 1:09:48.291
I got Soda on it
to the stash stop.

1:09:48.326 --> 1:09:49.622
We inside.

1:09:49.657 --> 1:09:50.491
- On my way.

1:10:12.482 --> 1:10:13.646
- Time is up, OG.

1:10:15.815 --> 1:10:18.354
- What the fuck y'all
little niggas doing in here?

1:10:18.389 --> 1:10:20.389
- My mama told me
about your ass, nigga.

1:10:22.525 --> 1:10:24.723
- And she told you I ain't
nothing to fuck with.

1:10:26.694 --> 1:10:27.560
- As I think back,

1:10:30.665 --> 1:10:32.830
I could have did things
a whole lot better.

1:10:35.065 --> 1:10:37.967
There's plenty of room in here
for the lost and misguided,

1:10:40.103 --> 1:10:43.313
but a shame for a man who
possessed the keys of prosperity

1:10:44.580 --> 1:10:46.514
to be in here next to me.

1:11:46.675 --> 1:11:49.412
And I want you to
think about that.

1:12:11.964 --> 1:12:14.437
But we don't get a chance
to rewrite history,

1:12:15.638 --> 1:12:18.606
but we do get a chance to
build a more promising future.

1:12:21.105 --> 1:12:22.907
- Every dog ass
nigga got their day.

1:12:25.945 --> 1:12:27.516
- You don't wanna
do that, Ritchie.

1:12:44.161 --> 1:12:46.469
- You hold the answers.

1:12:46.504 --> 1:12:48.768
The blueprint to the change

1:12:49.936 --> 1:12:52.772
that our community
so desperately need.

1:13:00.012 --> 1:13:02.782
- This ain't how it's
supposed to go down.

1:13:02.817 --> 1:13:05.488
- A man can't live
by bread alone.

1:13:24.641 --> 1:13:28.203
- You just gonna do
this to me, nigga?

1:13:28.238 --> 1:13:30.810
All you niggas?

1:13:33.276 --> 1:13:34.913
I'm a fucking vulture, too.

1:13:36.785 --> 1:13:39.522
I put in work and fed a
lot of you niggas, man.

1:13:50.601 --> 1:13:52.964
Vulture City for life, right?

1:14:27.572 --> 1:14:29.572
- Your Pop's gonna
be proud of you, boy.

1:14:32.203 --> 1:14:33.402
Be sure you tell your Mama

1:14:33.438 --> 1:14:36.172
I'm a send that care package
to him in the morning, aight?

1:16:20.751 --> 1:16:21.684
- Hello?

1:16:21.719 --> 1:16:22.982
- Yeah, he just left.

1:16:23.017 --> 1:16:24.852
He took Maliq with him.

1:18:32.047 --> 1:18:33.816
- Welcome home, G.

1:18:43.322 --> 1:18:44.926
- What's his future without you?

1:18:49.295 --> 1:18:50.899
- No, no!

1:18:50.934 --> 1:18:51.801
- You're under
arrest for the murder

1:18:51.836 --> 1:18:54.199
of Robert Ratford, AKA, Joe.

1:18:54.234 --> 1:18:57.807
Anything you say can and
will be used against you.

1:18:59.943 --> 1:19:01.173
- We could choose our actions,

1:19:02.440 --> 1:19:04.275
but we can't choose
our consequences.

1:19:11.581 --> 1:19:14.186
I want you to think about that.

1:19:20.557 --> 1:19:22.557
Looking forward to
seeing Maliq someday.

1:19:23.868 --> 1:19:27.463
I know he has in him,
what you have in you.

1:19:48.123 --> 1:19:51.454
And for the sake of the
next generation to come,

1:19:51.489 --> 1:19:53.962
your son's generation,

1:19:53.997 --> 1:19:56.833
somebody has to
stop the bleeding.
