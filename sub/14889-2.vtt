01:22.066 --> 01:23.633
No, I, I promise.

01:23.666 --> 01:26.700
Now, I’ll call you back
in a couple of days. Bye‐bye.

Cousin Larry...

01:30.733 --> 01:33.733
...you and your date
Jennifer Lyons

01:33.766 --> 01:37.100
will be the hit of
the airline tennis tournament.

01:37.133 --> 01:38.166
Why?

01:38.200 --> 01:39.633
Because, surprise.

01:39.666 --> 01:42.600
I’ve decorated
your tennis racket!

01:48.566 --> 01:50.000
Thanks, Balki.

seem too jazzed.

No, no. I, uh,
I love the kri‐kri tassels

02:02.466 --> 02:05.033
but I just got a call
from my sister Elaine.

02:05.066 --> 02:07.366
She got a scholarship to go to
the Juilliard’s School Of Music.

02:07.400 --> 02:09.500
‐That’s wonderful.
‐Not quite.

02:09.532 --> 02:11.666
She only got
a partial scholarship.

02:11.700 --> 02:14.366
What does that mean, she can
only go to part of the school?

02:14.400 --> 02:16.300
No.

02:16.333 --> 02:17.600
No, it means
they’ll only give her

02:17.633 --> 02:19.666
part of the money for tuition.

02:19.700 --> 02:22.066
And she won’t be able
to go to the school at all

02:22.100 --> 02:25.233
if she doesn’t come up
with other $3875.

02:26.366 --> 02:28.466
Does Cousin Elaine
have that kind of money?

02:28.500 --> 02:31.200
Of course not.
That’s why she called me.

02:31.233 --> 02:32.400
Oh.

02:33.833 --> 02:35.666
Do you have
that kind of money?

02:36.400 --> 02:38.266
Of course not.

02:38.300 --> 02:39.766
But I promised her
I’d come up with the money

02:39.800 --> 02:41.233
and I’m not gonna let her down.

02:41.266 --> 02:43.266
I just have to think
of a way to raise it.

we had a car accident.

We stopped at the red light

a few backs out in my time.

go to the hospital

05:10.400 --> 05:11.733

is the mental anguish.

07:32.266 --> 07:33.800
I mean, uh...

to being a‐an active

07:39.400 --> 07:42.100
It’s tough to sit back and...

07:42.133 --> 07:44.233
...not be able to do
things for yourself.

07:51.233 --> 07:53.700

‐Picking up a magazine.
‐One moment.

turning on the TV.

08:00.500 --> 08:02.466
They’re impossible.

08:04.633 --> 08:07.333
And, uh, of, of course the...

08:07.366 --> 08:11.600
...pain is unbearable at times.

08:11.633 --> 08:15.366
But really,
it’s, it’s the helplessness.

08:16.700 --> 08:20.500
The complete dependence
on someone else

08:20.533 --> 08:22.700
that, I think, is the...

08:26.366 --> 08:29.100
...the, the toughest pill
to swallow.

08:42.600 --> 08:44.500
It must be pure hell.

come back tomorrow, Larry and...

those thoughts of tennis

09:38.233 --> 09:40.233

09:41.500 --> 09:43.433

of rehab ahead of us

09:43.466 --> 09:45.033

09:45.066 --> 09:47.466

with Jennifer.

09:47.500 --> 09:48.700
Oh, you’re probably right, Balki

09:48.733 --> 09:50.066
but i‐it gives me a goal

09:50.100 --> 09:51.466
something to strive for.

09:51.500 --> 09:53.466
Shh! Shh! Shh!

09:55.633 --> 09:57.333
Now, listen, I’m going
to go to the market

09:57.366 --> 09:59.266
to pick up some
high fiber items.

10:04.233 --> 10:07.766
You just sit there
and leave the striving to us.

10:14.500 --> 10:17.033
Where do I come up with them?

10:18.800 --> 10:20.100

but it’s returned.

11:16.266 --> 11:17.133
It was a miracle.

11:17.166 --> 11:19.733
For, for a moment,
I was completely healed.

11:19.766 --> 11:23.100
Completely, but alas,
that moment is gone.

11:24.666 --> 11:25.766
Alas.

going to the store?

these things for myself.

this anymore, are you?

12:03.300 --> 12:04.166

how from your point of view

it looks kinda bad.

12:10.833 --> 12:12.766
"Kinda bad?"

12:14.466 --> 12:16.166

You’re only doing
this for Elaine?

12:20.366 --> 12:23.200
Cousin, you’re up to your
belly button in babasticki.

12:23.233 --> 12:25.166
No, no!

12:25.200 --> 12:26.766
I really am doing this
for Elaine.

12:26.800 --> 12:29.500
See, the guy who
hit me has insurance

12:29.533 --> 12:31.633
and I can get money
from his insurance company

12:31.666 --> 12:32.733
for my back injury.

12:32.766 --> 12:35.066
You mean, your back injury
that you don’t have.

12:35.100 --> 12:37.033
Yes. That’s the one.

12:37.066 --> 12:38.566
And then I am going
to take that money

12:38.600 --> 12:41.100
and give it to Elaine
for Juilliard.

12:41.133 --> 12:44.433
And nothing you can do or say
will make me change my mind.

12:47.433 --> 12:49.100
Oh, really?

12:49.133 --> 12:52.333
Well, how about,
liar, liar, pants on fire?

12:56.733 --> 12:58.000
Nope.

13:01.066 --> 13:05.733
Well, then, let me
tell you this, Mr. Hot Pants.

13:08.166 --> 13:12.133
It ain’t over
until Roseanne Barr sings.

13:13.300 --> 13:16.266
[instrumental music]

13:29.200 --> 13:30.666
[knock on door]

13:30.700 --> 13:32.166
Come in.

13:34.066 --> 13:35.433
Mr. Appleton...

13:35.466 --> 13:37.533
...I’m Joseph Garber
from the insurance company.

13:38.400 --> 13:40.533
Oh, please, uh, sit down.

13:41.233 --> 13:42.700
A wheelchair.

13:42.733 --> 13:44.333
Nice touch.

13:45.700 --> 13:48.366
I’ve been going over
your accident report.

13:48.400 --> 13:49.400
[sighs]

14:00.200 --> 14:05.033
Bamba stiki ekta kiki
iki eke bakoom. Oh, baby.

14:05.066 --> 14:09.333
Eeni pini epapepopokono
hodgi bodgi bam boom. Yo, mama.

14:09.366 --> 14:13.166
Bamba stiki ekta kiki
iki eke bakoom.

14:13.200 --> 14:16.066
Oh, baby.
Eeni pini epapepopokono.

14:16.100 --> 14:17.600
Hodgi bodgi bam boom.

14:17.633 --> 14:19.366
Yo, mama.

14:19.400 --> 14:23.166
’Bamba stiki ekta kiki
iki eke bakoom.’

14:23.200 --> 14:24.533
‐’Oh, baby...’
‐Excuse me.

14:26.200 --> 14:27.400
(Balki)
’Hodgi bodgi bam boom.’

14:27.433 --> 14:28.500
’A little softer, now.’

14:35.333 --> 14:37.066
What are you doing?

14:38.333 --> 14:40.066
I’m preparing to chant

14:40.100 --> 14:43.166
the epapepopokono
hodgi bodgi bam boom.

14:45.400 --> 14:48.500
The Myposan Litany of Truth.

14:49.700 --> 14:51.500
Do you have
to do that now?

14:54.166 --> 14:56.033
Yes, I do, cousin.

14:56.066 --> 14:57.366
While there might still be

14:57.400 --> 15:00.233
a small glimmer
of honesty left in you.

15:01.133 --> 15:03.700
And if there is that glimmer...

15:03.733 --> 15:06.300
...that small ember

15:06.333 --> 15:10.266
the epapepopokono
hodgi bodgi bam boom...

15:10.300 --> 15:13.466
...will fan it into a flame.

15:15.466 --> 15:18.400
Okay, fine, but chant quietly.

15:18.433 --> 15:20.700
I’m negotiating here.

15:20.733 --> 15:25.600
Bamba stiki ekta kiki
iki eke bakoom. Oh, baby.

15:25.633 --> 15:29.266
Eeni pini epapepopokono
hodgi bodgi bam boom.

15:29.300 --> 15:30.333
A little softer now.

15:30.366 --> 15:32.666
’Briber briber steka deta tiber’

15:32.700 --> 15:34.533
’iki eke bakoom.
Oh, baby.’

15:34.566 --> 15:37.800
Eeni pini epapepopokono
hodgi bodgi bam boom.

15:37.833 --> 15:39.066
From the top now!

15:42.400 --> 15:44.566
The things some people
will do for rain.

15:44.600 --> 15:47.166
[laughing]

15:47.200 --> 15:48.733
Now, uh, where were we?

15:49.766 --> 15:51.366
Based on the accident report

15:51.400 --> 15:54.166
and your medical file,
we’re prepared to offer you

15:54.200 --> 15:56.433
a very handsome
settlement of $2000

15:56.466 --> 15:58.333
for your pain and suffering.

15:59.233 --> 16:00.100
Two thousand dollars?

16:00.133 --> 16:03.433
But th‐that barely
covers my pain

16:03.466 --> 16:04.700
let alone my suffering.

16:04.733 --> 16:08.233
I was thinking more along
the lines of say...

16:08.266 --> 16:11.100
...three thousand eight hundred
and seventy‐five dollars.

16:11.133 --> 16:14.366
Well...you drive
a hard bargain, Mr. Appleton

16:14.400 --> 16:15.566
but you’ve got yourself a deal.

16:15.600 --> 16:17.566
I’ll get the paper work ready.

16:17.600 --> 16:19.366
[Balki chanting]

16:20.466 --> 16:23.133
Elefday, ho hoo
ho ho hoo ho.

16:23.166 --> 16:25.633
Elefday, ho hoo
ho ho hoo ho.

16:25.666 --> 16:28.200
Elefday, ho hoo
ho ho hoo ho.

16:28.233 --> 16:31.033
Elefday, ho hoo
ho ho hoo ho.

16:31.066 --> 16:33.766
Elefday, ha hoo
ho ha ha hoo ow.

16:35.300 --> 16:38.033
Stop it!
Stop it! Stop it!

16:39.833 --> 16:40.700
It’s over.

16:40.733 --> 16:43.566
You can knock off
The Litany of Truth.

16:43.600 --> 16:45.433
I already did, cousin.

16:45.466 --> 16:49.800
The Litany of Truth
failed as we have seen.

16:49.833 --> 16:50.600
Now, I’m chanting

16:50.633 --> 16:54.200
The elefday,
ho hoo ho ho hoo ho.

16:54.233 --> 16:57.600
The Myposian Litany of Hope,
for Elaine.

16:57.633 --> 17:01.533
I only hope you have not
doomed her to the same fate

17:01.566 --> 17:04.532
as that great Myposian
accordion player

17:04.566 --> 17:06.400
Oompo Mousikako.

17:07.800 --> 17:09.433
"Oompo Mousikako?"

17:10.500 --> 17:11.665
I never heard of him.

17:11.700 --> 17:13.700
So few people have.

17:16.633 --> 17:18.733
And do you know why?

17:18.766 --> 17:20.433
Because he, too...

17:20.465 --> 17:24.333
...began a very promising career
in music with...

17:25.532 --> 17:27.633
...tainted money.

17:29.400 --> 17:30.700
Tragic.

17:31.833 --> 17:33.566
You’ll have to tell
me about it later.

17:37.100 --> 17:39.133
I think I’ll tell you
about it now.

17:41.300 --> 17:42.633
Now would be good.

17:46.633 --> 17:48.233
You see, cousin...

17:48.266 --> 17:50.266
...when Oompo was very young

17:50.300 --> 17:52.033
his brother, Bimbo...

17:54.500 --> 17:58.266
...gave him some money to buy
his very first accordion...

17:58.300 --> 18:01.200
...and for years, Oompo
made the most beautiful music

18:01.233 --> 18:03.100
in all of Mypos.

18:03.133 --> 18:04.400
In fact, it was said of him

18:04.433 --> 18:07.366
he could make the sheep dance.

18:07.400 --> 18:09.433
What am I saying,
make the sheep dance?

18:09.466 --> 18:11.300
He could make the sheep dip.

18:26.751 --> 18:28.167
And then one day,
Oompo discovered

18:28.200 --> 18:33.094
that the money his brother Bimbo
had given him was stolen.

18:34.294 --> 18:35.761
He began to play badly

18:35.794 --> 18:39.461
which, on an accordion,
can be fairly irritating.

18:45.728 --> 18:49.461
His brother Bimbo’s
dishonesty robbed him...

18:49.494 --> 18:53.728
...of the most beautiful joy
in his life, his music.

18:53.761 --> 18:55.694
And I only hope
you have not doomed

18:55.728 --> 18:57.661
Cousin Elaine
to the same fate.

19:01.194 --> 19:03.761
Mr. Appleton, I think
I’ve got everything in order.

19:05.161 --> 19:07.528
Cousin, I think Mr. Garber
want to see you.

19:10.094 --> 19:11.428
Listen...

19:11.461 --> 19:15.061
...we both know that this
is a dishonest thing...

19:15.094 --> 19:18.561
...and we also both know
that deep down inside

19:18.594 --> 19:22.228
you are an honest man
...and not a Bimbo.

19:32.461 --> 19:34.628
If you’ll just
sign this here...

19:34.661 --> 19:39.328
...my company will send you
a check for $3875.

19:47.194 --> 19:49.094
[exhales sharply]

19:49.128 --> 19:51.328
Something wrong?

19:51.361 --> 19:54.428
Y‐yes, I‐I‐I...just remembered

19:54.461 --> 19:57.828
that I suffered
a similar injury

19:57.861 --> 20:00.528
when I was
in Little League...

20:00.561 --> 20:02.294
...and if there’s
the slightest chance

20:02.328 --> 20:05.128
that this is just
a recurrence of that injury

20:05.161 --> 20:06.628
uh, well, I, I...

20:08.728 --> 20:12.694
Uh, let’s just say
that my conscience

20:12.728 --> 20:16.161
won’t allow me to take
your company’s money.

20:16.194 --> 20:17.661
[laughing]

20:19.161 --> 20:20.494
You’re joking, right?

20:23.194 --> 20:25.061
I beg to take issue.

20:26.761 --> 20:28.128
Cousin Larry don’t joke

20:28.161 --> 20:30.161
when it comes to
matters of conscience.

20:31.561 --> 20:32.828
Well, great.

20:32.861 --> 20:35.161
Uh...in that case

20:35.194 --> 20:38.561
if you’ll just sign this
release form here...

20:41.761 --> 20:43.294
...I’ll be on my way.

20:44.161 --> 20:45.228
[chuckles]

20:47.828 --> 20:50.361
The guys down at the office
aren’t gonna believe this.

20:53.194 --> 20:55.128
Cousin, you did it.
You did it.

20:55.161 --> 20:56.794
I’m proud of you.

20:56.828 --> 20:58.328
Thanks, Balki.

20:58.361 --> 21:00.728
[inhales deeply]

21:00.761 --> 21:04.461
But I wouldn’t have had
to do the right thing if I...

21:04.494 --> 21:06.261
...hadn’t been
doing the wrong thing

21:06.294 --> 21:09.128
for the past five days.

21:09.161 --> 21:10.828
Oh, well, cousin...

21:10.861 --> 21:12.594
...you know, it,
it usually takes a while

21:12.628 --> 21:14.728
for your conscience
to kick in.

21:14.761 --> 21:16.761
For you, five days
is pretty good.

21:19.561 --> 21:21.394
I suppose it is.

21:22.728 --> 21:24.561
Well, I wasted
the last five days

21:24.594 --> 21:25.628
when I should’ve
been thinking

21:25.661 --> 21:29.128
of a way to raise money
for Elaine’s tuition.

21:29.161 --> 21:32.394
Well...maybe
we could sell something.

21:33.294 --> 21:36.494
I know. I’ll sell my car.

21:36.528 --> 21:39.394
Balki, you paid $600
for that car.

21:40.428 --> 21:44.061
I don’t think
we could get 3875.

21:44.094 --> 21:46.161
Even if we threw in
the fuzzy dice.

21:46.194 --> 21:48.328
Which we wouldn’t.
We wouldn’t.

21:53.328 --> 21:54.661
Well, she’s my sister.

21:54.694 --> 21:56.728
There’s only one thing to do.

21:56.761 --> 21:57.794
[inhales deeply]

21:57.828 --> 21:59.661
I’ll sell my car.

21:59.694 --> 22:00.761
Oh, cousin.

22:02.194 --> 22:03.828
I think your sister
is very lucky

22:03.861 --> 22:05.528
to have you for a brother.

22:06.728 --> 22:09.261
Thanks, Balki.

22:09.294 --> 22:12.161
Come on. Let’s go hit
the used car lots.

22:14.461 --> 22:16.328
Uh, Balki...

22:16.361 --> 22:19.128
...you’re not going out
like that, are you?

22:21.361 --> 22:24.428
Well, of course not.
Don’t be ridiculous.

22:27.694 --> 22:29.761
I’d look silly like this.

22:32.228 --> 22:34.228
Come on, cousin,
let’s go make a deal.

22:42.828 --> 22:45.094
[theme music]

23:11.861 --> 23:15.028
[music continues]
