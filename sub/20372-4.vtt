WEBVTT

00:09.384 --> 00:12.220
She wasn't my first girl or my second.

00:12.304 --> 00:14.055
<i>Previously on "You Me Her"...</i>

00:14.139 --> 00:15.349
Listen to me,

00:15.432 --> 00:17.685
do not say the "L" word to him.

00:17.768 --> 00:19.353
I almost got married when I was 18.

00:19.436 --> 00:20.771
What happened?

00:20.855 --> 00:22.648
He told me that he should probably go

00:22.731 --> 00:24.191
to this Brown University place.

00:24.274 --> 00:26.276
Dani: Honestly, this Lori person sounds like a real cunt.

00:26.360 --> 00:29.029
She has threatened to send out a blanket e-mail

00:29.112 --> 00:30.781
to all of the Hamilton parents.

00:30.865 --> 00:33.241
We're just going to delay the announcement of your promotion

00:33.325 --> 00:35.202
a couple of weeks.

00:35.285 --> 00:38.288
I'm making a silent vow to never ever end up like you.

00:38.372 --> 00:40.415
Oh, dear God. I made that.

00:40.499 --> 00:41.583
Jack.

00:41.667 --> 00:43.711
This just got weird.

00:43.794 --> 00:45.462
Ruby: So, whatever happened

00:45.546 --> 00:46.964
to that skinny, Nordic-looking chick

00:47.046 --> 00:49.466
you start dating immediately... after...

00:49.550 --> 00:52.011
After you dumped me? I married her.

00:52.093 --> 00:53.929
Ruby. Sure. I'll be right there.

00:54.013 --> 00:55.681
I was never here.

00:55.764 --> 00:57.349
Okay, don't leave my tab open.

00:58.475 --> 00:59.977
I left his tab open.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.937
My man.

01:02.021 --> 01:04.147
How would you feel about helping kids

01:04.231 --> 01:05.941
get to the other side of 21?

01:06.025 --> 01:07.526
Like a wellness center.

01:07.609 --> 01:09.028
She didn't seem like an ex.

01:09.110 --> 01:11.613
She seemed like<i> the</i> ex.

01:11.697 --> 01:13.782
It feels fragile. The three of us.

01:13.866 --> 01:15.784
You guys have been third- wheeling the shit out of me!

01:15.868 --> 01:19.538
You've decided that I'm not fluid, I'm a lesbian?

01:19.621 --> 01:21.415
Fuck you for making massive

01:19.621 --> 01:21.415
life decisions

01:21.498 --> 01:23.417
completely on your own that affect both of us.

01:23.500 --> 01:25.335
Well, then, fuck you both

01:25.419 --> 01:28.839
for chasing me down half-cocked, you matching set of dumbshits!

01:31.258 --> 01:33.594
Jack: What are we supposed to do about the elephant?

01:33.677 --> 01:35.679
You know, we may have slapped a coat of paint on it

01:35.763 --> 01:37.848
so it'd blend in with the walls, but I can still see it.

01:37.932 --> 01:39.182
You know why?

01:39.266 --> 01:40.768
'Cause it's a big painted elephant

01:40.851 --> 01:42.436
standing in our fucking bedroom.

01:42.519 --> 01:46.941
Dina: So, this elephant in the room, what does it --

01:47.024 --> 01:49.484
well, what does it represent?

01:49.568 --> 01:52.738
Imbalance. It represents imbalance.

01:52.821 --> 01:54.406
I know that.

01:54.489 --> 01:56.909
He has this absurd notion we're third-wheeling him.

01:56.992 --> 01:58.452
That he's our penis bridge

01:58.535 --> 02:00.996
to a more traditional lesbian relationship.

02:01.080 --> 02:03.874
I don't know, I mean, imagine I had a phase in my life

02:03.958 --> 02:06.710
where I was just like... you know, swimming in dicks.

02:06.794 --> 02:08.420
That's something I would probably

02:08.503 --> 02:10.338
tell my wife about, okay? But not her.

02:10.422 --> 02:12.633
Apparently, three of her past five relationships

02:12.716 --> 02:14.802
have been with women. I didn't know about it.

02:14.885 --> 02:16.720
Might have been nice to drop me a hint.

02:16.804 --> 02:18.055
Mm-hmm. So, Jack has now

02:18.138 --> 02:20.641
officially proclaimed me a homosexual.

02:20.724 --> 02:22.810
Okay. This whole thing started

02:22.893 --> 02:25.479
when Ding and Dong here raced to the airport to stop me

02:25.562 --> 02:28.148
from going home to Colorado but just forgot to discuss

02:28.231 --> 02:30.067
what they'd do when they got me back.

02:30.150 --> 02:31.485
And don't even get me started

02:31.568 --> 02:34.071
on the pumpkin spice fucking candles.

02:34.154 --> 02:36.364
What? I thought you liked those.

02:36.448 --> 02:38.117
What's wrong with them?

02:38.199 --> 02:41.411
You don't like the candles or the

02:41.495 --> 02:42.788
They're very seasonal.

02:42.871 --> 02:44.456
We love them.

02:44.539 --> 02:47.292
Dina: So... So would you say that perhaps the can--

02:47.375 --> 02:49.377
The candles are a metaphor?

02:49.461 --> 02:51.964
Yes, for our, uh -- our conventional

02:52.047 --> 02:55.258
30

02:55.342 --> 02:57.344
Is that it? -I don't know.

02:57.427 --> 02:59.805
Maybe, or they may just be gross.

02:59.888 --> 03:01.890
'Cause honestly, once you get it into your head,

03:01.974 --> 03:04.183
once you make the connection, you can't stop thinking

03:04.267 --> 03:05.894
that they smell like human feces, so...

03:05.978 --> 03:08.355
♪

03:30.919 --> 03:32.004
Morning.

03:35.549 --> 03:36.633
Hey, 'sup?

03:38.385 --> 03:40.595
Uh, I was -- I was just gonna have some cereal.

03:40.679 --> 03:43.182
You know, just like -- just, you know, reg cereal.

03:43.264 --> 03:44.975
Um, it's not a big deal. Do you want some?

03:45.059 --> 03:47.268
Whatever, I don't care.

03:47.352 --> 03:49.938
You're busy, so... bye.

03:50.022 --> 03:51.982
Uh, and I'll see you later.

03:52.066 --> 03:54.818
What, uh -- just see what's behind door number 1.

03:54.902 --> 03:56.236
Whoa.

03:56.319 --> 03:57.988
Uh, that was a weird thing to say.

03:58.072 --> 03:59.531
Is that a game

03:59.614 --> 04:01.658
I don't really get it 'cause I'm not 60.

04:03.911 --> 04:04.912
You need to stop that.

04:04.995 --> 04:06.371
Stop what?

04:06.454 --> 04:08.331
That whole, "I see you, Nina Martone" thing.

04:08.415 --> 04:10.209
I get it, fellow doctoral candidate.

04:10.291 --> 04:11.877
We can read each other's shit.

04:11.960 --> 04:13.962
You sure about that?

04:14.046 --> 04:15.505
What's my shit?

04:15.589 --> 04:17.298
Uh, pretending that you don't have any shit,

04:17.382 --> 04:18.550
which means you're super fucked up.

04:18.633 --> 04:21.095
Wow. I'm sorry to disappoint you.

04:21.178 --> 04:22.721
Parents are happily married.

04:22.804 --> 04:24.305
Great family.

04:24.389 --> 04:27.350
Still go to Blazers games with my Pops.

04:27.434 --> 04:28.769
Pops? Oh, God.

04:28.852 --> 04:30.604
It's even worse than I thought.

04:30.687 --> 04:33.232
It's -- you're just -- you're chronically happy,

04:33.314 --> 04:35.316
which means you're unacceptably dull.

04:35.400 --> 04:37.360
-Yeah, sorry.

04:37.444 --> 04:39.446
That didn't seem to be your diagnosis last night.

04:39.529 --> 04:40.989
-Mm-hmm.

04:49.957 --> 04:52.876
I'm not running away to Brown University.

04:55.129 --> 04:56.671
Izzy tell you that?

04:59.758 --> 05:01.260
Um...

05:01.342 --> 05:02.761
Oh, my God.

05:02.844 --> 05:04.512
You're still hanging out with Izzy.

05:04.596 --> 05:05.931
You guys are still fucking.

05:06.014 --> 05:07.390
I really am rebound girl.

05:07.474 --> 05:08.976
No, Nina.

05:09.059 --> 05:10.936
No, not at all.

05:11.019 --> 05:12.395
Look, we ran into each other on campus.

05:12.479 --> 05:14.773
We had a cup of coffee so that I could download

05:14.856 --> 05:16.441
the Nina Martone user's manual.

05:16.524 --> 05:18.359
And then she threatened to wear my balls as earrings

05:18.443 --> 05:19.653
if I ever hurt you.

05:19.736 --> 05:21.280
That's even worse than fucking her.

05:21.362 --> 05:24.241
No, it's not.

05:25.117 --> 05:26.994
Okay. Hyperbolic --

05:27.077 --> 05:28.954
obviously not worse than fucking her, but I...

05:29.037 --> 05:30.330
Why would she tell you that?

05:30.413 --> 05:31.748
She's the only person in the entire world --

05:31.832 --> 05:34.293
Well, maybe because

05:34.375 --> 05:36.753
I told her I'm falling for you.

05:39.965 --> 05:41.508
Nina.

05:41.591 --> 05:43.969
I have to get to class.

05:45.428 --> 05:47.931
Hey, babe! Nina!

05:48.015 --> 05:50.349
You're still in your jams.

05:50.433 --> 05:54.062
And you didn't take your purse or anything else.

06:01.278 --> 06:04.739
I didn't really have to get to class.

06:04.823 --> 06:07.575
No shit. Seriously?

06:07.659 --> 06:10.287
I kind of panicked there for a second.

06:10.369 --> 06:13.665
No shit.

06:20.297 --> 06:24.509
It's, uh -- it's kind of like a lumberjack type of thing.

06:24.592 --> 06:26.761
I guess we could microwave and share it.

06:29.306 --> 06:30.891
I would like that.

06:33.560 --> 06:35.812
♪

06:38.606 --> 06:40.483
I feel like I'm on the outside

06:40.567 --> 06:44.321
of this mundane suburban ritual looking in.

06:44.403 --> 06:47.866
You know

06:47.949 --> 06:50.118
It means we're taking out the trash.

06:50.202 --> 06:51.536
Therapy has its perils.

06:51.619 --> 06:53.621
-Hey. -Hey.

06:56.457 --> 06:58.085
-Yeah. -Hi.

06:58.168 --> 06:59.460
Glad you can still walk.

06:59.544 --> 07:01.129
Thank you.

07:01.213 --> 07:02.463
So girls can't drink beer?

07:02.547 --> 07:04.299
Is that how it works around here?

07:04.383 --> 07:06.801
Yeah, we have a strict, uh, no beer for girls policy

07:06.885 --> 07:08.803
here in the land where time stood still.

07:08.887 --> 07:10.305
No cursing either.

07:10.389 --> 07:11.848
You sure you want to live

07:11.932 --> 07:13.267
in this backwards fucking hellhole?

07:13.350 --> 07:16.436
Is it second Friday already? Oh, it's guys' night.

07:16.519 --> 07:18.980
So there's a guys' night but not a girls' night.

07:19.064 --> 07:21.275
Um, actually, there is -- tonight.

07:21.358 --> 07:22.483
Oh.

07:22.567 --> 07:23.985
Can you, uh, like, possibly dial down

07:24.069 --> 07:26.405
the righteous indignation to like a 9?

07:26.487 --> 07:29.074
Sorry. Apparently, therapy makes me salty.

07:33.661 --> 07:35.496
Freak train's already running off the rails?

07:35.580 --> 07:36.873
Really gonna miss you, Izzy.

07:36.957 --> 07:38.833
Emma: Guys, come on. It's just a check-up.

07:38.917 --> 07:41.378
You know, proactive relationship maintenance.

07:41.461 --> 07:42.503
-Yeah. -Yeah.

07:42.587 --> 07:44.965
We'll talk about it tonight.

07:45.048 --> 07:46.258
Yeah, we will.

07:46.341 --> 07:47.968
Oh, right, yeah. That's awesome.

07:48.051 --> 07:49.510
And hope you like Chardonnay.

07:49.594 --> 07:50.971
I've actually never had it

07:51.054 --> 07:53.181
'cause I'm not a desperate housewife of anywhere.

07:53.265 --> 07:56.810
But I'm gonna invite my friend Nina because I live here now.

07:58.061 --> 07:59.187
Across the street.

08:00.981 --> 08:03.400
Okay. Glad that all got worked out.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.152
See you in 10 minutes? -Yeah, definitely.

08:06.361 --> 08:08.363
-I'm sorry. -Yeah, no, totally.

08:08.447 --> 08:10.573
Carm?

08:10.657 --> 08:12.909
Do you have a sec?

08:14.995 --> 08:17.205
Oh, sh-should I go sit on the curb

08:17.289 --> 08:18.999
while the adults talk or...?

08:19.082 --> 08:22.127
No, no, you too. Whatever your real name is.

08:22.210 --> 08:23.544
Okay, make it quick

08:23.628 --> 08:25.297
'cause I'm having some kind of allergic reaction.

08:25.380 --> 08:26.840
Yeah, like, uh, like your skin's crawling?

08:26.923 --> 08:28.675
I see you're not gonna make this easy for me.

08:28.758 --> 08:30.802
Well, let's see, Lori. Because of you,

08:30.885 --> 08:33.138
I got kicked off of the theater project built

08:33.221 --> 08:34.889
on my blood, sweat, and tears,

08:34.973 --> 08:36.557
and now I hate going to work.

08:36.641 --> 08:37.642
But, uh, yeah, sure.

08:37.725 --> 08:39.478
Let's make this easy for you.

08:39.560 --> 08:42.605
I wanted to apologize.

08:43.940 --> 08:48.987
I was hoping that we could start over and be friends?

08:50.447 --> 08:52.491
Like, maybe I could come over for whatever it is

08:52.573 --> 08:54.284
you guys do every second Friday.

08:54.368 --> 08:55.743
Yeah, no.

08:55.827 --> 08:58.455
Yeah, we're at capacity. Like, maximum occupancy.

08:58.538 --> 08:59.914
Yeah, it's like a fire safety thing.

08:59.998 --> 09:01.208
Sorry.

09:01.291 --> 09:05.337
I had an epiphany. I'm an asshole.

09:05.420 --> 09:06.754
Always last to know.

09:06.838 --> 09:09.966
My mother was an asshole, her mother before her,

09:10.050 --> 09:12.469
and now my daughter is becoming an asshole.

09:12.552 --> 09:13.720
Ava? Come on.

09:13.803 --> 09:14.971
She came out of the box that way.

09:15.055 --> 09:16.348
So to speak.

09:17.182 --> 09:19.726
No, she was my angel.

09:20.768 --> 09:25.815
I'm hoping to break the asshole cycle before it's too late.

09:31.112 --> 09:32.822
Sure.

09:32.906 --> 09:34.991
Really?

09:38.912 --> 09:41.039
See ya later.

09:53.093 --> 09:55.429
The pumpkin spice candle. Ugh.

09:55.512 --> 09:57.180
I only lit one of them.

09:57.264 --> 09:59.349
Wait  Why?

09:59.433 --> 10:01.684
What's this? -Hey.

10:01.768 --> 10:04.521
A number in the middle of a piece of paper?

10:06.689 --> 10:07.607
It's a salary.

10:07.690 --> 10:09.025
Like every year?

10:09.109 --> 10:10.944
Yeah, every year.

10:11.027 --> 10:12.820
Wow.

10:12.904 --> 10:14.948
Private jet. Five-star hotel.

10:15.031 --> 10:17.033
Wait, so this is about a job?

10:17.117 --> 10:18.535
-Mm-hmm. -Em.

10:18.618 --> 10:19.660
Yeah.

10:20.954 --> 10:23.206
Yeah, coolest firm in Seattle.

10:23.290 --> 10:26.209
Their, um -- their senior partner is 60-something,

10:26.293 --> 10:29.879
so -- so they have been insinuating...

10:29.963 --> 10:32.006
They've been insinuating -- wait.

10:32.090 --> 10:33.341
Sorry.

10:33.425 --> 10:35.885
Um, how long has this been going on?

10:35.969 --> 10:37.637
I mean, it's just a discussion.

10:37.720 --> 10:40.098
It's not -- it's not like I'm actually gonna go.

10:40.181 --> 10:42.642
You don't -- you don't take the company jet

10:42.725 --> 10:45.645
and stay in a hotel like this if you're gonna say no.

10:45.728 --> 10:47.188
You know?

10:48.607 --> 10:51.943
Massive "fuck you" that gets around really fast, so...

10:54.112 --> 10:56.490
So you're not even considering it like at all?

10:56.573 --> 10:59.117
Even with your promotion on hold?

11:01.911 --> 11:03.913
Okay.

11:06.249 --> 11:08.585
It's really awesome.

11:11.254 --> 11:15.716
So, me, you, Carmen, Lori, Nina,

11:15.800 --> 11:18.637
shit ton of Chardonnay -- this could get weird.

11:18.719 --> 11:20.388
I recommend you curb your enthusiasm.

11:20.472 --> 11:21.473
Hmm.

11:26.853 --> 11:28.062
What's wrong?

11:28.146 --> 11:30.565
Clomid time.

11:30.649 --> 11:32.484
Whoa, you're still doing all that?

11:32.567 --> 11:33.860
Yep.

11:33.943 --> 11:35.654
And I got to lay off the booze and the weed.

11:35.736 --> 11:37.447
You must really want a kid.

11:37.531 --> 11:39.949
I must.

11:42.494 --> 11:44.579
What about you?

11:44.663 --> 11:49.543
Or are you too young to even think about that yet?

11:49.626 --> 11:50.960
Uh...

11:52.920 --> 11:57.342
Honestly, I've -- I've dreamt about it since I can remember.

11:57.425 --> 12:00.303
Only child of a broken family goes real hard

12:00.387 --> 12:02.472
in one of two directions, so...

12:07.726 --> 12:09.979
Um...

12:10.063 --> 12:12.440
When you and Jack get pregnant --

12:12.524 --> 12:15.360
If. If we get pregnant.

12:15.443 --> 12:20.490
Okay, if you get pregnant, what does that make me?

12:24.869 --> 12:26.705
♪ Whoo! ♪

12:26.787 --> 12:28.582
♪ Whoo! ♪

12:28.665 --> 12:30.083
Gabe: How is that misogynistic?

12:30.166 --> 12:31.710
I mean, it sounds like a compliment,

12:31.792 --> 12:33.752
but it's really just like saying "fairer sex."

12:33.836 --> 12:36.214
Exactly, it's -- it's like a thinly veiled prescription.

12:36.297 --> 12:38.757
You stay pretty and keep your shit together

12:38.841 --> 12:39.926
so I don't have to.

12:41.595 --> 12:43.012
Does it hurt?

12:43.096 --> 12:44.681
Don't answer. Don't say it. Don't answer.

12:44.763 --> 12:46.516
-You know, you two

12:46.600 --> 12:48.184
getting your heads so far up each other's asses.

12:48.268 --> 12:50.604
-Oh, come on. -Jack!

12:50.687 --> 12:51.521
What are you even talking about?

12:51.605 --> 12:52.731
No, I'm telling you.

12:52.855 --> 12:54.733
-Hi. -Hey.

12:54.815 --> 12:58.945
This is, um...

12:59.028 --> 13:00.029
-Ashton. -Ashton.

13:00.113 --> 13:01.573
Gabe: What's up?

13:01.656 --> 13:03.283
My date from Tinder --

13:03.366 --> 13:05.784
a land where he's still my age.

13:05.868 --> 13:07.579
Probably should update.

13:07.662 --> 13:10.081
Haven't changed much, though.

13:11.124 --> 13:12.459
That's a nice piece, man.

13:12.542 --> 13:14.502
Thanks. 20K. But who checks price tags?

13:14.586 --> 13:16.212
I'll tell you who -- poor people.

13:16.296 --> 13:18.131
Got to get the newest one, out next year.

13:18.214 --> 13:21.800
Got to pace it up, babe. Reservation's five minutes ago.

13:21.884 --> 13:24.803
Boys. -Okay.

13:24.887 --> 13:26.640
You still want the wellness thing to happen,

13:26.723 --> 13:28.767
you will call me in five minutes

13:26.723 --> 13:28.767
and get me out.

13:32.729 --> 13:35.440
Ashton. Hmm.

13:35.523 --> 13:37.609
What are these looks for? Don't give me that look.

13:37.692 --> 13:38.985
She's just an old friend.

13:39.068 --> 13:40.779
Oh, so you're saying that wasn't Ruby,

13:40.861 --> 13:42.905
the chick who dumped you right before you met Emma?

13:42.989 --> 13:45.116
Holy shit. Are you bringing that one in, too?

13:45.199 --> 13:47.285
She interviewed me for the professor position.

13:47.368 --> 13:48.369
That's all. -Oh, no shit.

13:48.453 --> 13:49.454
-Yeah. -Okay.

13:49.537 --> 13:50.871
Now we're thinking

13:50.955 --> 13:52.290
about starting a wellness center at Griffin.

13:52.373 --> 13:54.083
That's perfect for you. It's super gay.

13:54.167 --> 13:55.710
So does your current harem know about this?

13:55.794 --> 13:57.253
Or is it like a secret?

13:57.337 --> 13:58.338
-Okay, enough. -I'm just asking.

13:58.421 --> 13:59.506
You know what? This is...

13:59.589 --> 14:00.965
It's been one hour,

14:01.048 --> 14:02.425
and you guys have already pissed me off, okay?

14:02.509 --> 14:04.177
-New record.

14:04.260 --> 14:06.053
Good guys' night. -Don't lump me in with him.

14:06.137 --> 14:08.473
Jacky! And that's how it works.

14:08.556 --> 14:10.350
Boom -- he's gone like a little bitch.

14:10.433 --> 14:12.185
You're an incredibly wise man, you know that?

14:12.268 --> 14:14.646
-I know. Thanks, Dave. -I was being sarcastic.

14:14.729 --> 14:16.897
Yeah, you better run. David!

14:19.526 --> 14:21.235
Andy: I love my Pops.

14:21.319 --> 14:24.155
See more of him now than I did as a kid, though.

14:24.238 --> 14:25.490
He was always at work.

14:25.573 --> 14:28.034
He sold, uh...

14:28.117 --> 14:30.411
Shit. But, uh...

14:30.495 --> 14:32.747
Whatever -- he sold something.

14:32.831 --> 14:34.248
We'll say insurance.

14:34.332 --> 14:35.709
My point is, is that

14:35.792 --> 14:37.836
I was raised in a household of women --

14:37.918 --> 14:40.921
mom and two big sisters -- so I'm very comfortable

14:37.918 --> 14:40.921
on this side of the fence.

14:41.005 --> 14:42.173
-Mm-hmm.

14:42.256 --> 14:43.758
Don't worry -- his penis

14:43.842 --> 14:45.552
isn't gonna puncture your hallowed chick night.

14:45.635 --> 14:47.261
All that said, I will not be drinking Chardo-fuckin'-nay.

14:47.345 --> 14:48.555
Won't do it.

14:48.638 --> 14:50.473
Gives a man breasts.

14:50.557 --> 14:52.308
I don't even like Chardonnay.

14:52.392 --> 14:54.644
And yet when I gather with two or more women,

14:54.728 --> 14:56.229
I reflexively drink it.

14:56.312 --> 14:58.565
I'm starting to think we've been mass media brain-fucked.

14:58.648 --> 15:01.776
Hey. What are you making?

15:01.860 --> 15:05.405
Old fashioned -- classic cocktail.

15:05.488 --> 15:06.573
Mind making another?

15:06.656 --> 15:07.866
I would -- I would be honored.

15:07.948 --> 15:09.409
You know what? Make that two.

15:09.492 --> 15:10.827
The revolution will not be televised.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.995
No more Chardonnay -- say it with me, people.

15:13.079 --> 15:14.831
That's not gonna happen.

15:14.914 --> 15:17.958
Tastes like flat Fresca, but I strangely don't hate it.

15:18.042 --> 15:19.419
I have Molly in the car.

15:22.213 --> 15:24.424
-Bring her in. We love dogs.

15:25.633 --> 15:26.760
No. Mnh-mnh.

15:26.843 --> 15:29.053
Oh, oh.

15:29.136 --> 15:30.096
-Yeah. -Drugs.

15:30.179 --> 15:31.681
Drugs. -Mm-hmm.

15:31.765 --> 15:34.308
We know lots of dogs are called Molly, so...

15:34.392 --> 15:36.143
You know, I -- I think I'm gonna probably

15:36.227 --> 15:37.978
stay on this side of my line, but yeah.

15:38.062 --> 15:40.064
And I'll be going home to two small children

15:40.147 --> 15:41.900
and one presumably wasted husband, so...

15:41.982 --> 15:44.360
But, uh, we're all adults here,

15:44.444 --> 15:47.363
so, yeah, by, uh -- by all means indulge.

15:47.447 --> 15:49.031
-I'm in. -Let's roll.

15:49.115 --> 15:52.535
And the light beer is you, I assume.

15:52.619 --> 15:54.579
Here he is.

15:54.662 --> 15:56.790
Hey, uh, is my tab still open from last time?

15:56.873 --> 15:58.082
Yeah.

15:58.165 --> 15:59.626
Do you want me to just put these on that?

15:59.709 --> 16:02.128
-Might as well. -Cheers.

16:02.211 --> 16:03.963
Listen, uh, while I have you here,

16:04.046 --> 16:06.132
I used your riff the other day --

16:06.215 --> 16:08.301
the one you said to what's-his-pickle

16:08.384 --> 16:09.886
about what's-her-nuts.

16:09.969 --> 16:11.387
And it kind of came across

16:11.471 --> 16:14.014
as a little insensitive to the autism community.

16:14.098 --> 16:16.142
Yeah, that's not meant for them.

16:16.225 --> 16:17.894
No, I -- I didn't use it on an autistic person.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.270
But I was wondering

16:19.353 --> 16:21.105
if you could kind of clarify how I use it.

16:21.188 --> 16:22.941
Actually, no, I'm sorry.

16:23.023 --> 16:24.484
Just a flat no, huh?

16:24.567 --> 16:26.235
Yeah, if you could just maybe leave my tab open again,

16:26.319 --> 16:28.696
that'd be great. -Sure. Enjoy your flat beer.

16:26.319 --> 16:28.696
-Thanks.

16:30.197 --> 16:31.407
Interesting.

16:31.491 --> 16:33.200
What the hell was that about?

16:33.284 --> 16:34.869
You, Dr. Trakarsky.

16:34.953 --> 16:36.203
Hey, you.

16:36.287 --> 16:38.748
My liberator, you are a fucking genius.

16:38.832 --> 16:40.917
Dave: Did you actually tell him that you're a surgeon

16:41.000 --> 16:42.502
that specializes in anal retractions?

16:42.585 --> 16:43.878
Because that was technically my idea.

16:43.962 --> 16:45.505
I gave him that to give to you.

16:45.588 --> 16:47.674
So I'm -- I'm the genius. I'm just saying.

16:47.757 --> 16:48.842
It was my idea, as well.

16:48.925 --> 16:51.678
Dislodging a TV remote as we speak.

16:51.761 --> 16:53.721
You know, a domestic dispute, so...

16:56.182 --> 16:57.892
Remember me

16:57.976 --> 16:59.936
Jack's big brother. How are you?

17:00.019 --> 17:03.690
Uh... a little. Yeah.

17:03.773 --> 17:04.941
You were big. -Yeah.

17:05.024 --> 17:06.108
And loud.

17:06.192 --> 17:07.151
Yeah, he's so different now.

17:07.234 --> 17:09.403
Thank you.

17:09.487 --> 17:12.448
So, I quit smoking like five years, six months,

17:12.532 --> 17:15.409
and two days ago, but I have been traumatized.

17:15.493 --> 17:19.831
So I bought a pack, and I desperately need one.

17:19.914 --> 17:22.625
Chat about the wellness center?

17:23.751 --> 17:25.169
Sure, yeah.

17:25.252 --> 17:27.129
I'm also traumatized by the company I keep,

17:27.213 --> 17:28.589
as you can tell. -Oh.

17:28.673 --> 17:30.216
More specifically, he's traumatized by me

17:30.299 --> 17:31.634
trying to turn him into a man.

17:31.718 --> 17:34.679
Bam, yeah. Now I remember you.

17:34.762 --> 17:36.472
Yes. Now she remembers you.

17:37.807 --> 17:40.142
Do you have any idea what it's like

17:40.226 --> 17:43.604
to be the one at the sleepover who gets picked up early

17:43.688 --> 17:46.440
because "nothing good happens after 10:00"?

17:46.524 --> 17:50.277
Can you even fathom how something like that --

17:50.361 --> 17:52.071
it defines you?

17:52.154 --> 17:55.199
Especially when everyone else's mom already hates your mom

17:55.282 --> 17:57.869
because she's a horrible, superior bitch.

17:57.952 --> 18:01.288
How -- how that scorn and the ridicule --

18:01.372 --> 18:04.375
it just makes you spiteful.

18:04.458 --> 18:06.502
This is all exploding in my head

18:06.586 --> 18:09.005
like a giant cycle of assholishness

18:09.088 --> 18:11.549
that is my responsibility to break

18:11.632 --> 18:14.510
for the sake of my daughter.

18:16.345 --> 18:17.764
I mean, does that make sense?

18:17.847 --> 18:19.599
I feel like I was rambling. Was I rambling?

18:19.682 --> 18:22.769
Wow. That was just...

18:22.852 --> 18:25.396
Shit, man.

18:25.479 --> 18:26.981
I'm sorry, but fuckin' A.

18:27.065 --> 18:29.149
That was so damn beautiful.

18:29.233 --> 18:30.818
Dial it back, Moonbeam.

18:30.902 --> 18:35.907
So deep and real and raw.

18:36.240 --> 18:38.034
Yeah.

18:38.117 --> 18:39.493
Hmm.

18:39.577 --> 18:44.164
It seems like you met Molly, but you didn't.

18:44.248 --> 18:45.499
Right?

18:46.459 --> 18:48.544
Well, thank you.

18:48.628 --> 18:51.923
Uh, but I don't know -- are you...

18:52.006 --> 18:54.092
Oh. Molly's amazing.

18:54.174 --> 18:57.344
You would fucking love Molly.

18:57.428 --> 18:59.513
She would -- she would complete you.

18:59.597 --> 19:03.851
So, is Molly a

19:03.935 --> 19:06.687
Yes. Uh, yes, that's exactly who she is.

19:06.771 --> 19:09.440
Um, Molly... Morgenstern.

19:09.523 --> 19:11.150
Very controversial.

19:13.360 --> 19:15.154
Your skin isn't like butter.

19:15.237 --> 19:17.657
It is butter.

19:17.740 --> 19:19.492
It -- it's not butter.

19:19.575 --> 19:21.285
-Come here. -No, no. Okay.

19:21.368 --> 19:23.245
Okay, enough with the heavy petting.

19:23.329 --> 19:26.332
You stay over there for a while.

19:26.415 --> 19:28.084
This Chardonnay shit is a revelation.

19:30.294 --> 19:32.254
So beautifully complex.

19:32.338 --> 19:34.757
I feel ashamed about any prejudice

19:34.841 --> 19:37.593
that I brought to this experience.

19:37.677 --> 19:39.846
Mm. Mm-hmm. It is good.

19:39.929 --> 19:42.098
-It's good.

19:42.181 --> 19:44.809
Not sure I'm getting quite as much out of it as you, but...

19:45.601 --> 19:47.186
Lori.

19:47.269 --> 19:48.104
Lori.

19:48.187 --> 19:50.648
You're forgiven. And you are loved.

19:54.068 --> 19:58.405
None of us will ever make you leave the sleepover.

19:58.489 --> 20:00.658
Ever.

20:00.741 --> 20:03.369
Oh, that was so good, Iz.

20:03.452 --> 20:04.829
So poignant.

20:04.912 --> 20:06.956
Poignant. Poignant.

20:07.040 --> 20:08.082
Oh, hey, Lori.

20:08.166 --> 20:09.876
My babysitter just texted.

20:09.959 --> 20:11.377
And everyone forgives you, so...

20:11.460 --> 20:12.753
Except for me.

20:12.837 --> 20:14.047
I'm gonna need a little more convincing,

20:14.130 --> 20:15.464
so let's finish up at my house, okay?

20:15.548 --> 20:17.299
Wha-- no, no. They're being so nice.

20:17.383 --> 20:19.844
-I love you, Lori. -I love you.

20:19.927 --> 20:21.137
Okay, that's great. Here we go.

20:21.220 --> 20:23.097
Bring your drink.

20:23.181 --> 20:24.306
Oh. Okay.

20:24.390 --> 20:25.892
You are loved!

20:25.975 --> 20:27.185
-Yeah. -So loved.

20:27.267 --> 20:28.686
Emma: Thank -- thank you for coming.

20:28.769 --> 20:31.438
-You're loved. -Let me just put my shoes on.

20:31.522 --> 20:33.482
-Thanks for coming.

20:35.109 --> 20:36.527
It's overwhelming.

20:36.610 --> 20:38.654
Lori Matherfield

20:38.738 --> 20:39.864
Yeah.

20:44.326 --> 20:49.248
♪

20:51.667 --> 20:56.338
I -- I was conducting a very important experiment.

20:56.422 --> 20:58.465
Trying to figure out the level of drunk

20:58.549 --> 21:01.135
that it would take to make a guy like that fuckable.

21:01.219 --> 21:03.179
Okay, well, I only met him briefly,

21:03.262 --> 21:04.471
but I would have to go

21:04.555 --> 21:06.640
with, uh, thoroughly blacked out maybe.

21:10.352 --> 21:13.397
I think my vagina would scream until I woke up.

21:13.480 --> 21:14.941
Yeah.

21:15.024 --> 21:17.985
All right, I just said "fuckable" and "vagina"

21:18.069 --> 21:20.320
before we finished a cigarette.

21:22.322 --> 21:23.616
Okay, here we go.

21:23.699 --> 21:26.410
Um, I think we have a really good shot

21:26.493 --> 21:28.955
at this wellness center idea, Dr. Trakarsky.

21:29.038 --> 21:30.957
Yeah. Good.

21:31.040 --> 21:34.293
Boom -- abruptly and awkwardly back to business.

21:40.674 --> 21:44.178
I think your ex is an asshole.

21:46.513 --> 21:47.640
And an idiot.

21:47.723 --> 21:50.643
That he is. Thank you.

21:58.525 --> 22:00.987
What

22:03.864 --> 22:05.992
Alternate realities.

22:06.075 --> 22:09.369
Yeah.

22:12.039 --> 22:15.542
Did you know that there are molecular tests

22:15.626 --> 22:19.964
that suggest that there's, like, thousands of realities

22:20.047 --> 22:22.424
that are happening at once?

22:22.508 --> 22:24.593
Right. Cat in the box.

22:24.677 --> 22:25.803
That's right.

22:25.886 --> 22:27.305
-Yeah.

22:27.387 --> 22:28.889
You open the lid, and you're discovering

22:28.973 --> 22:30.474
only one of the many outcomes.

22:30.557 --> 22:33.686
Cat's dead, cat's alive.

22:33.769 --> 22:34.937
Cat has kittens.

22:35.021 --> 22:37.731
Ruby didn't break up with Jack.

22:41.194 --> 22:43.487
Ruby didn't break up with Jack.

22:51.662 --> 22:53.789
It's all so fucking complicated now, though.

22:53.873 --> 22:56.834
Roo, you have no idea.

22:56.917 --> 23:00.254
Roo -- I haven't heard that in a long time.

23:00.338 --> 23:01.672
I like it.

23:01.755 --> 23:03.381
It's nice.

23:19.523 --> 23:21.441
Maybe it's me.

23:21.525 --> 23:23.401
Maybe I'm the one making it complicated.

23:23.485 --> 23:25.238
Maybe it's not them.

23:25.988 --> 23:27.447
Them? It's a long story.

23:36.082 --> 23:38.209
I need to go home.

23:42.171 --> 23:44.840
Wait, do it again.

23:51.555 --> 23:54.308
It feels so good.

23:54.392 --> 23:56.102
Ho, ho, ho.

24:06.612 --> 24:08.197
It's like you put on mittens.

24:09.531 --> 24:10.991
So, this is happening.

24:11.075 --> 24:12.326
Hey, you.

24:12.410 --> 24:14.745
Come in. The water's warm.

24:14.828 --> 24:16.330
It's so warm.

24:16.414 --> 24:18.040
Izzy, um -- yeah, yeah -- Izzy took Molly.

24:18.124 --> 24:20.709
I -- and I tried to...

24:20.793 --> 24:22.295
Great, it's awesome.

24:22.378 --> 24:24.213
So now aphrodisiacs are part of chicks' night?

24:24.297 --> 24:26.757
That's right. No more Chardonnay.

24:26.840 --> 24:29.009
No more Char -Jack.

24:29.093 --> 24:30.636
Come on.

24:36.350 --> 24:37.768
Is he mad?

24:40.354 --> 24:41.563
Are you mad?

24:44.150 --> 24:45.776
How is that fair?

24:45.859 --> 24:47.111
Just not now.

24:47.194 --> 24:48.988
Not now? -Just not right now.

24:49.071 --> 24:51.073
Jack, let us -- let us just dry off,

24:51.157 --> 24:52.950
and then we can talk about this.

24:53.033 --> 24:54.576
Listen to me.

24:54.660 --> 24:56.787
Like, a minute before you came in,

24:56.870 --> 24:59.081
I just said to her  I just said --

24:59.165 --> 25:02.835
I just finished telling someone that I was the complication,

25:02.918 --> 25:04.837
that I was to blame.

25:04.920 --> 25:07.965
Someone

25:08.048 --> 25:10.968
Ruby.

25:12.636 --> 25:15.222
Fuck this.

25:18.351 --> 25:20.353
Jack!

25:24.440 --> 25:26.025
Fuck!

25:27.609 --> 25:29.945
Okay, we didn't -- we didn't do anything wrong.

25:30.029 --> 25:31.489
He's never left like that before.

25:31.571 --> 25:34.408
Just go to your side of the tub.
