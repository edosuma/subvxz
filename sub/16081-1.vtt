01:53.800 --> 01:56.130
What is the meaning of this?

01:56.133 --> 01:58.803
You are working on
experiments of regeneration

01:58.804 --> 02:01.299
which brings the
dead back to life.

02:01.300 --> 02:02.300
Are you not?

02:03.433 --> 02:05.232
I owe you no explanation.

02:05.233 --> 02:06.766
Leave!

02:06.767 --> 02:10.426
My follower has deep interest
in the work you are doing.

02:10.433 --> 02:13.599
This work has not been
sanctioned by CSS,

02:13.600 --> 02:17.499
so you will turn
everything over to us.

02:17.500 --> 02:18.330
Now.

02:20.400 --> 02:21.470
I will not.

02:22.400 --> 02:23.330
You will,

02:25.033 --> 02:25.873
you will.

02:30.067 --> 02:30.897
No!

02:33.367 --> 02:37.527
You animals, I will not turn
my work over to butchers!

02:39.933 --> 02:41.703
You will, you will.

02:55.500 --> 02:59.330
Such medical advancements
wasted on a monster.

03:00.567 --> 03:03.497
Higler has bigger plans
for the work done here,

03:03.500 --> 03:04.500
much bigger.

03:05.900 --> 03:09.466
You have no idea how we
plan to build on the design.

03:09.467 --> 03:13.067
The brain and the heart,
collect them, now!

06:57.233 --> 06:59.832
Duke Larson to harbor command.

06:59.833 --> 07:02.066
Harbor
command, what is it?

07:02.067 --> 07:04.427
I'm about to go out and
make a sweep of the cove,

07:04.433 --> 07:06.673
any word on those
missing boaters?

07:06.674 --> 07:09.127
No
report on the people.

07:09.133 --> 07:11.373
But, a few life vests
were found in the tide

07:11.374 --> 07:13.027
just an hour ago.

07:13.033 --> 07:17.032
Any markings to identify
where they might have come from?

07:17.033 --> 07:19.266
None,
standard issue.

07:19.267 --> 07:22.027
All right, well
keep me posted.

07:22.033 --> 07:24.132
The last thing we need is a
summer full of missing swimmers

07:24.133 --> 07:26.633
and boaters, bad for business.

07:27.967 --> 07:31.527
Great
deduction, Captain Obvious.

09:15.533 --> 09:17.173
This is a vacation, Coop,

09:17.174 --> 09:19.527
enough of the
technology already.

09:19.533 --> 09:20.773
Madge, you have your books,

09:20.774 --> 09:23.327
I have my electronic devices.

09:23.333 --> 09:25.833
Skip, say something, please.

09:27.233 --> 09:29.033
What is the weather
supposed to be like today?

09:31.533 --> 09:32.373
What?

09:33.767 --> 09:35.266
I don't wanna get stuck out
in the water, in a boat,

09:35.267 --> 09:37.527
when it's gonna pour down rain.

09:37.533 --> 09:38.566
Do you?

09:38.567 --> 09:40.866
That's not the point.

09:40.867 --> 09:42.766
Yes, it is.

09:42.767 --> 09:46.097
The point is, we've been planning
this excursion for weeks

09:46.100 --> 09:48.870
and our intentions were to
leave all this baggage behind.

09:48.871 --> 09:51.666
Why'd we bring you then?

09:51.667 --> 09:53.167
Why do I bother?

09:54.967 --> 09:56.697
We're only teasing you.

09:56.700 --> 09:57.930
It's because we like you.

09:57.933 --> 09:59.432
You wanna go on a date?

09:59.433 --> 10:02.232
You know I'm
seeing Jimmy Calton.

10:02.233 --> 10:03.903
See, there you
go again, Madge.

10:03.904 --> 10:07.166
He's only teasing
you, a joke, haha.

10:07.167 --> 10:09.166
You mean neither
of you would date me?

10:09.167 --> 10:11.466
Noooooo!

10:11.467 --> 10:13.027
Seriously?

10:13.033 --> 10:14.666
You two.

10:14.667 --> 10:16.527
What's the name of this place?

10:16.533 --> 10:17.966
Katzman Cove, why?

10:17.967 --> 10:22.727
I'm gonna look it up
and get all techy on it.

10:22.733 --> 10:24.502
Who's gonna drive the boat?

10:24.503 --> 10:27.769
None of us, the boat's
rental has it's own driver.

10:27.770 --> 10:30.327
You mean like a
personal tour guide?

10:30.333 --> 10:34.432
No, like someone who actually
knows how to pilot a boat.

10:34.433 --> 10:36.899
Stop the presses, folks.

10:36.900 --> 10:39.630
Some bad stuff on
Katzman Cove on the net.

10:39.633 --> 10:42.232
We're adults, hit us with it.

10:42.233 --> 10:43.703
Well this is from
a recent news report

10:43.704 --> 10:46.130
dated three days
ago, and I quote,

10:46.133 --> 10:48.002
"The recent disappearance
of several boaters

10:48.003 --> 10:50.099
"and sunbathers has hurt
the tourist industry

10:50.100 --> 10:51.930
"of Katzman Cove.

10:51.933 --> 10:53.973
"Authorities are
looking into the causes

10:53.974 --> 10:58.397
"of the recent tragedies, but
no answers are forthcoming."

10:58.400 --> 11:00.769
That doesn't sound
very comforting.

11:00.770 --> 11:02.966
Is it too late to
get our deposit back?

11:02.967 --> 11:03.797
Yep.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.130
Everything on the
internet is true.

11:07.133 --> 11:10.532
Can't believe you're
gonna let that spook you.

11:10.533 --> 11:13.499
People disappear int
he ocean everyday.

11:13.500 --> 11:15.199
Coves, Skip, a cove.

11:15.200 --> 11:17.430
I can look it up but it's
an end let of the ocean.

11:17.433 --> 11:18.966
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:18.967 --> 11:21.027
I don't need a geography lesson.

11:21.033 --> 11:24.832
My point is, that it could be
some kind of isolated incident

11:24.833 --> 11:27.102
and we shouldn't let
it ruin a good time.

11:27.103 --> 11:28.999
Why let
disappearances and death

11:29.000 --> 11:31.500
get in the way of a good time?

11:32.700 --> 11:34.799
See, that fellow over
there isn't deterred

11:34.800 --> 11:37.800
by urban legends
or old wives tales.

12:14.033 --> 12:17.073
Biting already.

13:16.400 --> 13:18.099
That's exactly how
I found him, sir.

13:18.100 --> 13:20.630
What do you reckon it could be?

13:20.633 --> 13:22.366
Looks like scraps.

13:22.367 --> 13:25.266
Scraps of different
species of sharks.

13:25.267 --> 13:27.327
Scraps of shark?

13:27.333 --> 13:28.670
Who'd carve up a bunch of shark

13:28.671 --> 13:30.166
and dump 'em down
here like this,

13:30.167 --> 13:31.966
it doesn't make any sense.

13:31.967 --> 13:33.997
Yeah, the tide
washed 'em up here.

13:34.000 --> 13:38.170
For the record, nothing makes
sense around here any more.

13:43.267 --> 13:47.397
Maybe there's another shark
out there, a bigger one,

13:47.400 --> 13:49.666
eating all the little sharks.

13:49.667 --> 13:51.497
That's a piece
of a Great White.

13:51.500 --> 13:54.066
Ain't nothing bigger and
meaner than a great white.

13:54.067 --> 13:55.397
I've fished these
waters for years,

13:55.400 --> 13:57.570
I ain't never seen
anything like that.

13:57.571 --> 13:58.866
Never?

13:58.867 --> 14:02.627
No sir, great white
has no natural enemy.

14:02.633 --> 14:04.133
He does now.

14:07.333 --> 14:09.732
What are you thinking?

14:09.733 --> 14:13.403
Disappearing people,
sharks eating sharks,

14:14.833 --> 14:18.433
the only thing missing from
this story is a mad scientist.

14:24.800 --> 14:26.230
Return, return,

14:27.933 --> 14:29.433
return, my friend.

14:53.867 --> 14:55.197
Soon, very soon.

14:56.967 --> 15:00.497
All these years of
secret work will pay off,

15:00.500 --> 15:04.830
and we'll finally create a
legion of indestructible voyages

15:04.833 --> 15:09.003
and finish what was started
by so many, so long ago.

15:10.467 --> 15:13.366
Clouse will be that person
to take 60 years of work,

15:13.367 --> 15:16.267
and bring it into
the 21st century,

15:17.533 --> 15:19.373
and make humanity beg.

15:23.167 --> 15:27.327
I have a feeling good fortune
will soon be coming our way.

15:38.200 --> 15:40.430
Finally, we're here.

15:40.433 --> 15:43.399
Due in no part to
my fantastic driving.

15:43.400 --> 15:45.430
Now, let's get our stuff gang.

15:45.433 --> 15:47.703
I have everything I need.

16:05.300 --> 16:07.330
Man it looks
like a used car lot.

16:07.333 --> 16:09.099
Lead the way.

16:09.100 --> 16:11.530
There's row B, right there.

16:45.400 --> 16:48.666
Hello, are you our
guide, Hoskins?

16:48.667 --> 16:51.097
We rented the boat
for eight hours.

16:51.100 --> 16:54.966
You'll take us where
we wanna go to, right?

16:54.967 --> 16:57.497
Does anyone else have
a bad feeling about this?

16:57.500 --> 17:00.199
Well, we paid for the boat.

17:00.200 --> 17:02.399
It's not like they'd hire
a psychopath to drive it.

17:02.400 --> 17:03.330
Would they?

17:04.400 --> 17:06.566
She's got a point.

17:06.567 --> 17:09.497
Permission to come
aboard, Captain?

17:39.733 --> 17:42.473
Out there, that
way, my good man.

18:05.500 --> 18:07.770
Man, this is awesome.

18:08.967 --> 18:10.966
I wonder how fast one
of these things goes?

18:10.967 --> 18:13.067
Fast enough to kill you
if you're not careful.

18:14.300 --> 18:16.700
Don't even ask to drive it.

18:18.567 --> 18:20.866
Even Hoskins thinks
it's a bad idea.

18:20.867 --> 18:23.127
What's eating' ya, Madge?

18:25.600 --> 18:28.399
If you stare into the
blackness of the water,

18:28.400 --> 18:30.470
then it makes you wonder.

18:31.933 --> 18:32.773
Yeah?

18:34.400 --> 18:37.430
What if there was
something down there?

18:37.433 --> 18:40.432
Like what, the
Lochness Monster?

18:40.433 --> 18:41.599
Or Flipper?

18:41.600 --> 18:43.130
Puff the Magic Dragon?

18:43.133 --> 18:44.899
Son of Godzilla.

18:44.900 --> 18:46.070
I'm serious.

18:47.500 --> 18:50.070
All those missing swimmers
and boaters went somewhere.

18:50.071 --> 18:53.627
I mean, something
happened to them.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.566
Maybe Hoskins knows.

18:55.567 --> 18:56.927
Do you know what's
been going on out here

18:56.933 --> 18:58.273
at Katzman Cove?

19:05.533 --> 19:09.266
Doesn't sound good,
whatever he's trying to say.

19:09.267 --> 19:11.267
Let's just keep going.

19:36.533 --> 19:37.473
Hey!

19:50.067 --> 19:51.227
What the hell?

20:42.100 --> 20:44.330
Afternoon Hoskins, folks.

20:45.533 --> 20:47.799
Is something wrong, sir?

20:47.800 --> 20:49.699
Yeah, there is.

20:49.700 --> 20:51.666
Did we do something wrong?

20:51.667 --> 20:53.397
No, no, not at all.

20:53.400 --> 20:55.099
But, I have to ask you
to cut your fun short

20:55.100 --> 20:57.066
and head back to the marina.

20:57.067 --> 20:58.027
What the hell for?

20:58.033 --> 20:59.332
We rented this thing all day

20:59.333 --> 21:00.673
and we still have
six hours left.

21:00.674 --> 21:02.327
I understand
you're disappointed.

21:02.333 --> 21:03.902
But, there's been some trouble

21:03.903 --> 21:07.230
and for everyone's safety,
you need to get off the water.

21:07.233 --> 21:09.899
Hoskins, take 'em in, okay?

21:09.900 --> 21:13.966
Thanks, we still on for
beers at The Rambler tonight?

21:13.967 --> 21:15.997
Can we ask what the danger is?

21:16.000 --> 21:17.630
That's confidential.

21:17.633 --> 21:21.566
But for your own safety, you
need to get back to shore.

21:21.567 --> 21:24.027
Can we at least
finish eating first?

21:24.033 --> 21:26.566
Sure, but wrap it up quickly.

21:26.567 --> 21:30.127
You guys have a good
afternoon, okay?

21:30.133 --> 21:31.966
We better get a refund.

21:31.967 --> 21:34.297
Just do what the man said.

21:56.467 --> 21:59.497
My friend, one last
test before we move ahead

21:59.500 --> 22:01.500
to the final transplant.

22:04.600 --> 22:07.330
We must make sure the
range on our control device

22:07.333 --> 22:09.233
is pushed to the limit.

22:30.567 --> 22:34.327
Soon, the world won't
have a leg to stand on.

22:42.567 --> 22:44.966
This just keeps getting
better and better all the time.

22:44.967 --> 22:46.997
Where the hell's
the rest of 'em?

22:47.000 --> 22:48.770
Maybe in the water?

22:50.000 --> 22:51.870
Yeah, he broke in
half all by himself

22:51.871 --> 22:53.666
and jumped in the water.

22:53.667 --> 22:55.827
Those are shark bites.

22:55.833 --> 22:58.032
Everybody's ready
to blame sharks, yet,

22:58.033 --> 23:01.166
none have been seen
offshore or in the cove.

23:01.167 --> 23:03.366
Either way, only a
shark could do this.

23:03.367 --> 23:05.866
Did you see the teeth marks?

23:05.867 --> 23:07.566
Yeah, I did.

23:07.567 --> 23:09.727
Well what are you
gonna do about it?

23:09.733 --> 23:13.666
Guess it's time to take this
investigation under water.

23:13.667 --> 23:17.497
All right, tell the
divers to move in.

23:17.500 --> 23:20.070
And I want a full report
when they surface.

23:20.071 --> 23:22.966
Yes
sir, right away.

23:22.967 --> 23:24.797
Okay,
let's move in.

23:24.800 --> 23:26.900
Remember, stick together.

24:03.200 --> 24:07.030
Let's go down a bit
farther, into the crevice.

24:38.867 --> 24:40.127
Did you see that?

24:40.133 --> 24:41.133
It was huge.

24:42.300 --> 24:46.170
Keep cool,
let's go check it out.

25:01.533 --> 25:03.203
Keep your lights on.

25:29.100 --> 25:33.000
Very good, let's try
10 kilometers northeast.

25:34.767 --> 25:36.597
Kill, kill, my friend.

27:25.867 --> 27:28.766
Now, make your way
back to home base,

27:28.767 --> 27:31.327
and spare nothing in your path.

27:42.400 --> 27:45.170
We've hit something,
down in the water.

27:45.171 --> 27:46.827
Or something hit us.

27:47.900 --> 27:49.900
Is it a submerged log?

27:53.333 --> 27:56.066
I can't tell, it's gone now.

27:56.067 --> 27:58.227
Hey Hoskins, let's do what
that patrol master asked

27:58.233 --> 28:00.073
and get back to harbor.

28:04.767 --> 28:06.827
What is it, what's wrong?

28:09.467 --> 28:11.227
Doesn't sound good.

28:12.633 --> 28:16.603
He's indicating the
propeller might be broken.

28:18.900 --> 28:21.370
Guess we're out here
for a while longer then.

28:21.371 --> 28:23.527
Can you fix it, Hoskins?

28:47.100 --> 28:49.000
Keep us posted, okay?

28:57.133 --> 28:59.503
He doesn't know how
long it's gonna take.

28:59.504 --> 29:01.400
That sucks, what now?

29:02.700 --> 29:04.399
Well there's a small
island over there.

29:04.400 --> 29:05.869
Why don't we go explore it?

29:05.870 --> 29:08.366
Hoskins can pick us up when
he gets the boat fixed.

29:08.367 --> 29:09.866
Cool idea.

29:09.867 --> 29:11.327
Seriously?

29:11.333 --> 29:12.966
Beats roasting out here.

29:12.967 --> 29:13.797
Yeah.

29:13.800 --> 29:15.699
It's an easy swim.

29:15.700 --> 29:17.930
I don't know about this idea.

29:17.933 --> 29:20.466
Come on, Madge, don't
be such a party pooper.

29:20.467 --> 29:21.297
Yeah.

29:22.733 --> 29:24.803
Hey, Hoskins, we're gonna
swim over to the island,

29:24.804 --> 29:28.300
pick us up when you
get the motor running.

29:35.833 --> 29:38.273
Don't worry, we'll be okay.

30:09.333 --> 30:11.466
Something brushed up against me.

30:11.467 --> 30:13.966
It's probably just a
fish, you are in the water.

30:13.967 --> 30:16.297
Come on, we're almost there.

30:43.533 --> 30:45.332
This place looks
pretty remote.

30:45.333 --> 30:47.473
Yeah, there's tons
of these small islands

30:47.474 --> 30:49.066
pocketing the cove.

30:49.067 --> 30:51.997
Hey, maybe we'll find
some lonely native girls.

30:52.000 --> 30:55.130
Or maybe we'll find trouble.

30:55.133 --> 30:56.932
Which way?

30:56.933 --> 31:00.299
Well, we can work
our way up that side,

31:00.300 --> 31:03.330
or we could follow
the shoreline.

31:03.333 --> 31:05.570
Let's follow the shoreline,
that way if Hoskins

31:05.571 --> 31:08.166
fixes the boat, he'll
be able to see us.

31:08.167 --> 31:12.327
Okay, I'll leave the bag
here for a reference point.

32:43.700 --> 32:45.199
End of the line guys.

32:45.200 --> 32:47.399
Looks like it's been
here for 60 years.

32:47.400 --> 32:49.166
Let's keep going.

32:49.167 --> 32:51.466
No way, there
could be a mad hermit

32:51.467 --> 32:55.197
ready to unleash some
wild dogs or something.

32:55.200 --> 32:56.969
We'll just go
a little ways in,

32:56.970 --> 32:59.127
if we hear any dogs
barking, we'll turn back.

32:59.133 --> 32:59.973
Come on.

33:23.033 --> 33:25.332
I knew someone
lived back here.

33:25.333 --> 33:27.066
Let's head back.

33:27.067 --> 33:29.297
Looks like something
from Sanford and Son.

33:29.300 --> 33:31.330
Yeah, the house looks
completely abandoned.

33:31.333 --> 33:33.132
Let's check it out.

33:33.133 --> 33:34.299
I'm game.

33:34.300 --> 33:35.530
Coming, Madge?

33:35.533 --> 33:37.366
Do I have a choice?

33:37.367 --> 33:40.097
Yeah, you can
wait right there.

34:09.533 --> 34:14.498
The bodies keep piling up,
but the clues sure don't.

34:14.500 --> 34:15.799
Dispatch?

34:15.800 --> 34:17.498
Yes, sir?

34:17.500 --> 34:19.199
Keep those no
swimming signs going up

34:19.199 --> 34:21.730
every 50 feet along the beach.

34:21.733 --> 34:23.666
We're
working on it.

34:23.667 --> 34:26.065
Has Hoskins returned
to the marina?

34:26.067 --> 34:27.797
Not sure.

34:27.800 --> 34:29.570
Well check the log books.

34:29.571 --> 34:32.266
One moment.

34:32.266 --> 34:35.527
No, there is no record of
Hoskins in the log book.

34:35.533 --> 34:37.831
He must still be
out on the water.

34:37.833 --> 34:39.732
That's what I was afraid of.

34:39.733 --> 34:42.599
Have a boat ready for me, I'm
gonna go out and look for him.

34:42.600 --> 34:44.170
Him and those kids he
was escorting must be

34:44.170 --> 34:45.666
in some kind of trouble.

34:45.667 --> 34:48.597
Yes,
sir, right away.

35:04.700 --> 35:07.130
This place is disgusting.

35:07.133 --> 35:09.473
100 years ago this
place was probably home

35:09.474 --> 35:13.427
to elegant parties held
by someone very wealthy.

35:13.433 --> 35:15.932
I guess they shouldn't
have fired the maid.

35:15.933 --> 35:17.632
Someone still lives here.

35:17.633 --> 35:20.366
What makes you say that?

35:20.367 --> 35:22.727
That looks fresh.

35:22.733 --> 35:24.273
So what, you think
we're the only people

35:24.274 --> 35:25.827
who trespass in here?

35:25.833 --> 35:27.532
Bet you half of
Katzman Cove come here

35:27.533 --> 35:29.633
to get high and have sex.

35:31.567 --> 35:33.666
What was that?

35:33.667 --> 35:35.927
It sounded like an
iron gate closing.

35:35.933 --> 35:37.399
Did you feel it?

35:37.400 --> 35:39.430
It came from underneath the
floor like it was in the water.

35:39.433 --> 35:42.232
Who cares what it was,
let's just get out of here.

35:42.233 --> 35:44.173
Where's your
sense of adventure?

35:44.174 --> 35:46.427
Back on the boat with Hoskins.

35:46.433 --> 35:47.832
Well you can stay
here if you want.

35:47.833 --> 35:50.003
I'm gonna go check it out.

35:51.200 --> 35:53.830
He's gonna get us all
in big trouble some day.

35:53.833 --> 35:55.003
That's Coop.

35:58.400 --> 36:00.069
Looks like an
experimental tank,

36:00.070 --> 36:02.866
but what would it be doing
here in this old place?

36:02.867 --> 36:04.466
If I was doing
something sinister,

36:04.467 --> 36:07.766
I'd wanna hide away
in a place like this.

36:07.767 --> 36:11.897
Maybe they train killer
whales or dolphins.

36:11.900 --> 36:14.966
There's something
in the tank, look.

36:14.967 --> 36:16.697
She's right.

36:16.700 --> 36:18.330
It looked like
what I saw earlier

36:18.333 --> 36:20.403
when we were on the boat.

36:21.800 --> 36:24.070
Like I said, it's a
dolphin or a killer whale.

36:27.067 --> 36:29.566
What the hell did we just see?

36:29.567 --> 36:32.627
A shark, a monster shark.

36:32.633 --> 36:35.002
I've never seen a
shark like that before.

36:35.003 --> 36:36.730
It looked like a
grotesque combination

36:36.733 --> 36:38.699
of different sharks.

36:38.700 --> 36:41.366
There's something really
weird going on here.

36:41.367 --> 36:42.197
So true.

36:43.200 --> 36:44.200
So, so true.

36:46.100 --> 36:48.270
Welcome to my humble home.

37:04.367 --> 37:08.027
Harbor control to
Hoskins, do you read me?

37:08.033 --> 37:09.133
This is Duke.

37:10.533 --> 37:11.673
Look, I know you can't
talk but you gotta send me

37:11.674 --> 37:13.327
some kind of signal.

37:17.533 --> 37:18.473
Hoskins, I need to
know that you're okay.

37:18.474 --> 37:20.866
Send me some kind of signal.

37:20.867 --> 37:21.697
Damn it!

37:46.800 --> 37:48.830
What are you gonna do with us?

37:48.833 --> 37:51.499
I ask the
questions, young lady.

37:51.500 --> 37:54.399
Who are you and what
are you doing here?

37:54.400 --> 37:57.766
I'm Skip, this is
Coop, she's Madge.

37:57.767 --> 38:00.427
We swam to this
island from our boat.

38:00.433 --> 38:02.603
It broke down in the cove.

38:03.800 --> 38:04.900
Is that so?

38:06.067 --> 38:08.997
Who else is aware
of your presence here?

38:09.000 --> 38:11.666
Just the pilot of the boat.

38:11.667 --> 38:16.127
Well, this could be fortuitous
for all parties involved.

38:16.133 --> 38:19.366
I may need a few extra hands.

38:19.367 --> 38:22.566
What if we don't
wanna help you?

38:22.567 --> 38:25.397
Then all your
troubles are over.

38:26.900 --> 38:28.930
What do you need us to do?

38:28.933 --> 38:32.999
I need your help with an
experiment, that is all.

38:33.000 --> 38:34.899
Then you'll let us go?

38:34.900 --> 38:36.830
You'll let us leave?

38:36.833 --> 38:41.332
Yes, if you cooperate
you will be set free.

38:41.333 --> 38:43.573
How do we know
you'll keep your word?

38:43.574 --> 38:45.766
Clouse is a man of his word.

38:45.767 --> 38:47.427
If I promise you something,

38:47.433 --> 38:49.803
you can be guaranteed
it will happen.

38:49.804 --> 38:51.466
Okay, okay, it's cool.

38:51.467 --> 38:54.366
You would be wise not
to test my generosity.

38:54.367 --> 38:57.127
I have been working
here for many years.

38:57.133 --> 38:59.732
And the experiment
for the great cause

38:59.733 --> 39:02.866
is close to coming to formation.

39:02.867 --> 39:05.697
What experiments
are you working on?

39:05.700 --> 39:09.430
You saw the shark, the
specially created shark.

39:09.433 --> 39:13.132
A combination of great
white, blue, hammerhead,

39:13.133 --> 39:16.332
and mako, all
killers of the sea.

39:16.333 --> 39:21.099
I stitched it together with
my own hands, these hands.

39:21.100 --> 39:23.930
The great experiment
will succeed.

39:24.967 --> 39:27.427
What is this great experiment?

39:27.433 --> 39:29.766
I'm so glad you asked.

39:29.767 --> 39:32.597
It started back
during World War II.

39:32.600 --> 39:35.299
The FBI found out about an
experiment being furthered

39:35.300 --> 39:38.366
by scientists without approval.

39:38.367 --> 39:42.527
The heart and brain of
the Frankenstein monster,

39:42.533 --> 39:44.033
still alive, here.

39:45.467 --> 39:47.397
That's just a
fictitious story.

39:47.400 --> 39:50.866
No, my friend,
it was very real.

39:50.867 --> 39:54.366
The plan was to use this
miraculous feat of science

39:54.367 --> 39:57.697
to create a race of creatures
that were indestructible

39:57.700 --> 40:02.630
and unstoppable, used to win
the war on the water front.

40:02.633 --> 40:04.732
It was brilliant.

40:04.733 --> 40:07.673
Germany lost
World War II, badly.

40:09.267 --> 40:12.127
I am aware of that
but it doesn't mean

40:12.133 --> 40:14.532
the experiment would end.

40:14.533 --> 40:17.999
Pockets of resistance
groups have combined forces,

40:18.000 --> 40:20.270
and we will see is the
birth of a new weapon,

40:20.271 --> 40:22.997
and we will start a new war.

40:23.000 --> 40:26.130
One we will finish, and win.

40:26.133 --> 40:28.473
Why Frankenstein's
heart and brain?

40:28.474 --> 40:29.927
Why not?

40:29.933 --> 40:33.332
A beautiful blend
of animal and man.

40:33.333 --> 40:34.573
Sharkenstein?

40:36.333 --> 40:38.833
Very clever, yet so fitting.

40:40.267 --> 40:42.327
We have the brain and
heart of other top leaders

40:42.333 --> 40:44.432
and scientists, all preserved

40:44.433 --> 40:46.899
in the same manner
as the monster.

40:46.900 --> 40:49.230
Once we perfect the
shark experiments,

40:49.233 --> 40:52.332
we will move toward
human transplants.

40:52.333 --> 40:56.132
You mean they
saved Hitler's brain?

40:56.133 --> 40:57.133
Precisely.

40:58.500 --> 41:00.299
You will assist me in
putting the monster's heart

41:00.300 --> 41:02.800
and brain into my super shark.

41:07.767 --> 41:11.527
This is the part where
you tell me I'm crazy.

41:24.367 --> 41:26.927
Looks like a storm's brewing.

41:49.633 --> 41:51.703
It is time, my friends.

44:47.733 --> 44:50.003
It's a fantastic success.

44:55.367 --> 44:57.666
It's alive, it's alive!

44:57.667 --> 45:00.697
Quickly, we must
move it to the deck.

45:06.467 --> 45:07.867
Seems unstable.

45:09.200 --> 45:10.666
Don't be stupid.

45:10.667 --> 45:13.497
It's recovering from the
side effects of the surgery.

45:13.500 --> 45:16.599
How would you feel if you
woke up in a shark's body?

45:16.600 --> 45:19.630
The monster hasn't known
true life for many decades.

45:19.633 --> 45:23.232
I will communicate with
it, and it will understand,

45:23.233 --> 45:24.073
and learn.

45:25.533 --> 45:28.403
You have been very useful to
me in the great experiment,

45:28.404 --> 45:33.166
now I must detain you until
I have time to decide.

45:33.167 --> 45:34.097
Decide what?

45:34.100 --> 45:35.999
You said you'd let us go.

45:36.000 --> 45:40.430
I will, but now I have
important matters to attend to.

45:40.433 --> 45:44.366
And I need you where I can
call on you if need be.

45:44.367 --> 45:45.197
Now move.

45:56.300 --> 45:58.730
Stay put, I will be back soon.

46:09.333 --> 46:11.602
We should have known
better than to trust him.

46:11.603 --> 46:14.799
He had a gun trained
on us, what could we do?

46:14.800 --> 46:16.970
Don't worry about it, we'll
figure a way out of this.

46:16.971 --> 46:19.227
We just have to keep our heads.

46:19.233 --> 46:22.566
We just operated on a
shark and transplanted

46:22.567 --> 46:26.166
the Frankenstein monster's
brain and heart into it.

46:26.167 --> 46:28.666
This is a vacation we
aren't sure to forget?

46:28.667 --> 46:30.166
We need to find
a way out of here,

46:30.167 --> 46:32.697
because he is coming back
and then he's gonna kill us.

46:32.700 --> 46:34.266
We don't know that.

46:34.267 --> 46:36.866
We know too much, we
know his whole crazy plan.

46:36.867 --> 46:38.897
Our main priority
is to get out of here

46:38.900 --> 46:40.566
and warn the authorities.

46:40.567 --> 46:44.727
Now let's try to find something
to break out of here with.

47:14.400 --> 47:16.530
Do you hear me?

47:16.533 --> 47:19.599
I am your master
and you will obey.

47:19.600 --> 47:21.099
Do you hear?

47:21.100 --> 47:22.270
You will obey.

47:25.067 --> 47:25.897
Obey!

47:27.267 --> 47:30.366
You are the Frankenstein
monster and I am your master.

47:30.367 --> 47:32.997
I know you are full
of cruelty and hate,

47:33.000 --> 47:36.499
and I will help
you channel that.

47:36.500 --> 47:38.230
Is that better?

47:38.233 --> 47:40.899
I am Clouse, my
voice will guide you

47:40.900 --> 47:43.430
and I will be your master.

47:43.433 --> 47:46.699
Are you ready for
your first assignment?

47:46.700 --> 47:48.999
There is a small boat
anchored a short way

47:49.000 --> 47:53.699
from this building, seek it out
and kill the human on board.

47:53.700 --> 47:54.530
Now go!

48:25.400 --> 48:26.730
Obey!

48:26.733 --> 48:29.003
You are attracting
unwanted attention.

48:29.004 --> 48:31.366
This is not part of the plan!

48:31.367 --> 48:33.527
I am your master, obey me!

48:36.000 --> 48:38.830
I am you master,
obey me, obey me!

48:54.167 --> 48:55.597
You stupid beast!

48:56.533 --> 48:58.403
Monster, you will obey!

48:59.333 --> 49:01.666
You cannot stray from the plan.

49:01.667 --> 49:02.827
You will obey!

49:14.200 --> 49:18.630
Hurry up, Clouse von butt
head will be back any second.

49:18.633 --> 49:20.973
I'm trying, Madge,
cut us some slack.

49:20.974 --> 49:25.127
Come on, just a little
more, I think it's budging.

49:26.200 --> 49:27.699
The building is falling.

49:27.700 --> 49:29.899
That sounded like a
support beam breaking.

49:29.900 --> 49:32.900
It's the shark,
it's going bizerk.

49:36.900 --> 49:38.130
I think it's going over.

49:38.133 --> 49:39.633
We'll be killed.

49:54.433 --> 49:55.832
Is everything okay?

49:55.833 --> 49:57.473
We need to get to shore.

49:57.474 --> 49:58.627
She's right.

50:02.200 --> 50:03.130
No, skip!

50:16.733 --> 50:18.573
Hurry up and get in!

50:27.100 --> 50:28.499
That was too close.

50:28.500 --> 50:30.399
What the hell was that thing?

50:30.400 --> 50:31.666
Sharkenstein.

50:31.667 --> 50:32.927
Sharken what?

50:32.933 --> 50:34.802
It's a monster, made
from different sharks,

50:34.803 --> 50:36.630
and Frankenstein's
heart and brain.

50:36.633 --> 50:37.899
Like the story?

50:37.900 --> 50:39.199
Yes, yes, let's just
talk about it later

50:39.200 --> 50:41.099
and get the hell out of here.

50:41.100 --> 50:42.630
We're too late.

50:42.633 --> 50:45.073
It's circling back to ram us.

50:57.667 --> 50:59.797
So what's the plan
before we run out of gas?

50:59.800 --> 51:01.766
I'm gonna get us back to land.

51:01.767 --> 51:03.727
Great plan, I would have
never thought of that.

51:03.733 --> 51:06.166
Hey, if you don't like it,
you can jump out and swim.

51:06.167 --> 51:07.397
I could've left you
and your girlfriend

51:07.400 --> 51:09.499
back in the water to
end up as shark chow.

51:09.500 --> 51:10.969
She's not my girlfriend!

51:10.970 --> 51:13.097
Yeah, well I figured
a square like you

51:13.100 --> 51:16.270
couldn't get a girl
that good looking.

51:29.667 --> 51:31.297
Sharkenstein won't give up.

51:31.300 --> 51:32.930
Get us to land, fast.

51:32.933 --> 51:35.932
I'm working on it, Rome
wasn't built in a day you know.

51:35.933 --> 51:37.999
No, but your coffin will be.

51:38.000 --> 51:40.230
Move it, move it!

51:40.233 --> 51:41.603
Over there, a dock.

51:41.604 --> 51:44.770
We'll take this in,
he's almost on us.

51:53.267 --> 51:55.197
Eat shit Frankenstein.

51:55.200 --> 51:57.366
This is for you.

51:57.367 --> 51:58.827
What's it doing?

52:00.433 --> 52:03.933
Looks like it's
sizing up the situation.

52:11.733 --> 52:13.932
Don't worry, it can't
live out of water.

52:13.933 --> 52:14.833
We're safe.

52:27.333 --> 52:28.966
We're in big trouble.

52:28.967 --> 52:30.427
How so?

52:30.433 --> 52:32.132
Lightening is what brought
the Frankenstein monster

52:32.133 --> 52:33.233
back to life.

52:34.767 --> 52:35.697
That's bad.

52:47.267 --> 52:50.597
Everything's afraid of
fire, especially Frankenstein.

52:50.600 --> 52:51.730
Sharkenstein.

52:51.733 --> 52:52.633
Whatever.

52:57.933 --> 52:59.703
We gotta follow it, and stop it.

52:59.704 --> 53:00.799
Are you nuts?

53:00.800 --> 53:02.030
I'm out of here.

53:02.033 --> 53:04.170
Duke is right,
we have to stop it.

53:04.171 --> 53:05.627
It's a killing machine.

53:05.633 --> 53:08.332
You're only saying that
because he said you were cute.

53:08.333 --> 53:09.173
Yeah.

53:10.567 --> 53:11.927
Look, you two love birds
do whatever you want.

53:11.933 --> 53:13.503
I'm going after it.

53:15.033 --> 53:17.570
We already lost Skip,
isn't that enough?

53:17.571 --> 53:20.066
We have a duty to
do something about it.

53:20.067 --> 53:22.597
The only duty we
have is to survive.

53:22.600 --> 53:25.430
We've been through
enough already.

53:51.300 --> 53:52.800
Put my cow down.

53:53.667 --> 53:54.497
Now!

54:03.900 --> 54:06.770
How do you know we're
on Sharkenstein's trail?

54:06.771 --> 54:09.227
I'm following
these fin tracks.

54:09.233 --> 54:10.832
Come on.

54:10.833 --> 54:12.632
How long has
this been going on?

54:12.633 --> 54:14.166
What, shark hunting?

54:14.167 --> 54:17.327
No, the disappearances,
the murders?

54:20.433 --> 54:23.299
A few weeks in abundance.

54:23.300 --> 54:25.499
You say the guy that
created this mutant,

54:25.500 --> 54:27.399
he was a mad scientist?

54:27.400 --> 54:30.466
Yeah, he was a Nazi wannabe.

54:30.467 --> 54:32.697
This is part of a
larger experiment.

54:32.700 --> 54:36.870
Others around the world are
working on the same thing.

54:38.033 --> 54:39.573
Once we stop Sharkenstein,

54:39.574 --> 54:42.497
we'll have to deal
with that too.

54:42.500 --> 54:44.699
One thing at a time, Maggie.

54:44.700 --> 54:47.370
It's Madge, the name is Madge.

55:33.133 --> 55:34.803
Damn it, I'm lost.

55:40.300 --> 55:43.599
I have a weapon,
and I know karate.

55:43.600 --> 55:44.600
Who's there?

55:51.800 --> 55:53.700
Must just be my nerves.

56:10.800 --> 56:13.470
I hope you found dinner already.

56:18.233 --> 56:19.666
That sounded like Coop.

56:19.667 --> 56:20.727
It came from that direction.

56:20.733 --> 56:22.733
Come on, let's go.

56:32.100 --> 56:34.466
Hold on, let's listen.

56:34.467 --> 56:37.467
A giant shark, a
monster, on land.

56:38.567 --> 56:41.366
It almost got my cattle,
it went that way.

56:41.367 --> 56:43.666
We need to kill it before
it harms anyone else.

56:43.667 --> 56:45.166
Yeah!

56:45.167 --> 56:46.997
No one's safe while this
creature roams the land.

56:47.000 --> 56:48.130
Yeah!

56:48.133 --> 56:49.473
Let's go kill this instant!

56:49.474 --> 56:50.627
Yeah!

56:50.633 --> 56:51.473
Come on!

56:53.700 --> 56:56.230
Shouldn't we follow them?

56:56.233 --> 56:59.366
No, we're gonna go that way.

56:59.367 --> 57:00.197
Why?

57:01.200 --> 57:02.870
Cause this looks like a scene

57:02.871 --> 57:05.127
from a Universal horror film.

57:05.133 --> 57:07.632
These yokels will do nothing
but shoot themselves up,

57:07.633 --> 57:10.432
and us if we get
in between them.

57:10.433 --> 57:13.433
An angry mob's
nothing to mess with.

57:38.733 --> 57:41.502
Okay, Cathy, step over
the water and give me

57:41.503 --> 57:43.699
some of those poses that
your fans will remember.

57:43.700 --> 57:46.566
It's not Cathy, it's Bonnie.

57:46.567 --> 57:48.697
Bonnie Boom Boom.

57:48.700 --> 57:51.270
That was back in the 80's
when you were a porn star.

57:51.271 --> 57:52.927
Adult entertainer.

57:54.367 --> 57:56.866
Well Bonnie Boom Boom, the
publisher of Adult Stars Today

57:56.867 --> 57:58.766
would like some pictures,
so if you don't mind,

57:58.767 --> 57:59.866
can you do something?

57:59.867 --> 58:00.697
Anything.

58:07.667 --> 58:10.527
I thought you said
this was a closed shoot?

58:10.533 --> 58:13.166
I don't wanna be
swarmed by my fans.

58:13.167 --> 58:14.927
Yeah, all five of
them tracked you down

58:14.933 --> 58:16.532
after all these years.

58:16.533 --> 58:17.433
Watch it.

58:33.400 --> 58:37.230
I'm guessing you're not
interested in an autograph,

58:37.233 --> 58:38.073
are you?

58:50.267 --> 58:52.597
I didn't even get your name!

58:58.767 --> 58:59.897
This way folks!

58:59.900 --> 59:01.400
Yeah!

59:12.233 --> 59:15.073
What a grotesque
mockery of man and fish.

59:15.074 --> 59:16.497
Damn!

59:16.500 --> 59:18.370
Do you think it'll
return to the water?

59:18.371 --> 59:19.927
No, I doubt it.

59:19.933 --> 59:21.602
The human side is taking over.

59:21.603 --> 59:23.899
It becomes a battle
of both parts,

59:23.900 --> 59:25.230
and nobody wins.

59:26.633 --> 59:29.232
Remember, it has the
monster's brain and heart.

59:29.233 --> 59:32.966
Legend says it's
indestructible, unstoppable.

59:32.967 --> 59:34.827
Nothing's indestructible.

59:34.833 --> 59:39.166
Think back to the movies,
maybe there's a clue there.

59:39.167 --> 59:42.066
The Frankenstein book
and movies differ greatly.

59:42.067 --> 59:45.497
There's no consistency between
them and the real thing.

59:45.500 --> 59:46.970
How many movies are there?

59:46.971 --> 59:48.197
Scores.

59:48.200 --> 59:50.199
Some based on the book,
and most famous series

59:50.200 --> 59:53.999
are the old Universal films
and the British hammer films.

59:54.000 --> 59:56.870
You sure do know a lot
about that subject, don't you?

59:56.871 --> 59:58.827
I pride myself on it.

59:58.833 --> 01:00:01.366
Well, name Universal films.

01:00:01.367 --> 01:00:03.227
Well, there's the
original Frankenstein,

01:00:03.233 --> 01:00:05.573
and The Bride of Frankenstein,
both borrow heavily

01:00:05.574 --> 01:00:07.227
from the book.

01:00:07.233 --> 01:00:09.832
Then there's Son of Frankenstein,
Ghost of Frankenstein,

01:00:09.833 --> 01:00:13.632
Frankenstein Meets The Wolfman,
and House of Frankenstein.

01:00:13.633 --> 01:00:16.332
Okay, now the hammer films.

01:00:16.333 --> 01:00:18.499
All in blood curdling color.

01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:21.499
There's Curse of Frankenstein,
Revenge of Frankenstein,

01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:25.030
Frankenstein must be destroyed,
Frankenstein Created Woman,

01:00:25.033 --> 01:00:28.902
Horror Frankenstein, Frankenstein
and The Monster From Hell.

01:00:28.903 --> 01:00:30.830
Well that's a boat
load of Frankensteins.

01:00:30.833 --> 01:00:33.032
You asked, I told you.

01:00:33.033 --> 01:00:34.566
Back to destroying it.

01:00:34.567 --> 01:00:37.097
Well, we know
it's afraid of fire.

01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:40.266
Maybe we need to trap
it and burn it to death.

01:00:40.267 --> 01:00:41.527
There's an old
lighthouse that sits

01:00:41.533 --> 01:00:43.966
on the north ridge of the cove.

01:00:43.967 --> 01:00:46.127
The state uses it to
store munitions that were

01:00:46.133 --> 01:00:48.532
left over from when they
dredged the channel.

01:00:48.533 --> 01:00:51.703
If we can lure it in there,
and set those things off,

01:00:51.704 --> 01:00:55.099
that's sure to be the end of it.

01:00:55.100 --> 01:00:59.366
Either way, Sharkenstein
must be destroyed.

01:00:59.367 --> 01:01:01.066
First we have to locate it.

01:01:01.067 --> 01:01:03.497
Yeah, well, I've
got that covered too.

01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:06.230
We'll just let the angry
mob flush it out for us.

01:01:06.233 --> 01:01:09.499
All we have to do is stick
close and buy our time.

01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:10.330
Come on.

01:01:33.767 --> 01:01:34.966
Hold your places, folks.

01:01:34.967 --> 01:01:37.197
We're just a few
yards ahead of him.

01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:38.999
He's gotta come through
here sooner or later,

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.630
and when he does,
let him have it.

01:01:41.633 --> 01:01:43.103
Can you believe this?

01:01:43.104 --> 01:01:45.330
Shark monster on land?

01:01:45.333 --> 01:01:46.732
What's the world coming to?

01:01:46.733 --> 01:01:48.373
When we kill it,
we'll take it's carcass

01:01:48.374 --> 01:01:50.997
and tour around the world,
and make a fortune out of it.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:54.199
Sharkenstein, live
and in person.

01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:57.499
There's just one
problem with that.

01:01:57.500 --> 01:01:59.399
What might that be?

01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:02.130
It is in person, but
it isn't gonna be alive.

01:02:02.133 --> 01:02:05.633
Just give me a second
to think about it.

01:02:09.933 --> 01:02:10.873
What the?

01:02:14.367 --> 01:02:15.367
Over there!

01:02:15.367 --> 01:02:16.197
Shoot it!

01:02:25.900 --> 01:02:27.730
Follow that fish feed!

01:02:44.900 --> 01:02:47.566
There it is,
the old light house.

01:02:47.567 --> 01:02:49.827
And you said there
were munitions inside?

01:02:49.833 --> 01:02:51.366
There used to be.

01:02:51.367 --> 01:02:54.367
Let's go see if
they're still there.

01:03:25.133 --> 01:03:26.599
What a pit.

01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:29.499
I'm surprised this place
hasn't fallen in on itself.

01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:31.499
They only use it for storage.

01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:34.330
Look around for
some large crates.

01:03:34.333 --> 01:03:35.333
Like that?

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.670
Let's open it up and find out.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:44.130
Dynamite.

01:03:44.133 --> 01:03:45.632
And plenty of it.

01:03:45.633 --> 01:03:48.432
Enough to blow Sharkenstein
back to the stone ages.

01:03:48.433 --> 01:03:50.532
So now what do we do?

01:03:50.533 --> 01:03:53.866
We'll wire this
stuff together,

01:03:53.867 --> 01:03:58.197
then we'll place some
charges in various points

01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:00.499
around the base
of the lighthouse.

01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:02.930
We'll run 'em all the
way up to the top.

01:04:02.933 --> 01:04:06.332
Once we lure that monster
in here, we'll trap him,

01:04:06.333 --> 01:04:08.199
and we'll set 'em off.

01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:09.799
How do we do that
without getting ourselves

01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:11.499
killed in the process?

01:04:11.500 --> 01:04:13.866
We'll think of something.

01:04:13.867 --> 01:04:16.766
But in the mean time,
let's just get started.

01:04:16.767 --> 01:04:19.566
And be careful, these
things are old and volatile.

01:04:19.567 --> 01:04:21.427
Just like you.

01:04:21.433 --> 01:04:22.273
Funny.

01:05:14.033 --> 01:05:16.766
Well, Madge, I guess
that about does it.

01:05:16.767 --> 01:05:19.697
Now, all we have to do
is lure the creature here.

01:05:19.700 --> 01:05:22.030
Yeah, and I know just how.

01:05:37.267 --> 01:05:39.597
You may be the expert
on Frankenstein movies,

01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:41.770
but I know a little
bit about sharks,

01:05:41.771 --> 01:05:45.697
and one thing they can't
resist is fresh blood.

01:06:02.233 --> 01:06:04.203
I could have saved
you the trouble.

01:06:04.204 --> 01:06:05.599
How so?

01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:07.566
I have my period.

01:06:07.567 --> 01:06:09.697
Now you tell me.

01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:11.999
Now you know how we feel.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:12.830
Gross.

01:06:15.567 --> 01:06:16.727
There it is!

01:06:17.867 --> 01:06:19.997
Don't let it get away this time!

01:06:27.300 --> 01:06:28.130
Come on!

01:06:44.900 --> 01:06:48.330
It's headed this way
along with the angry mob.

01:06:48.333 --> 01:06:50.503
Good, now get down here.

01:06:52.900 --> 01:06:54.800
God, I hope this works.

01:07:07.033 --> 01:07:09.002
Okay, now listen to
me very carefully.

01:07:09.003 --> 01:07:11.199
I need you to take
cover in the thickets.

01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:14.799
And no matter what happens, do
not go into the light house.

01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:19.030
But, the explosives,
you could be killed.

01:07:19.033 --> 01:07:20.999
Hey, we're a team.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.199
Look, everything will
work out at the end.

01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:24.770
Just go take cover.

01:07:30.300 --> 01:07:31.200
Crazy kids!

01:07:40.700 --> 01:07:43.470
Come on, come and get
me if you got the guts!

01:07:43.471 --> 01:07:46.867
Or didn't your master
sew any into you?

01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:36.069
It's trapped in
there, set it ablaze!

01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:42.130
Burn it down!

01:08:42.133 --> 01:08:45.870
No, there's someone in there,
Duke the harbor patrolman.

01:08:45.871 --> 01:08:47.497
We have to kill the monster!

01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:49.029
No, please!

01:08:49.033 --> 01:08:50.270
Get her off of me!

01:08:50.270 --> 01:08:51.997
Duke, you have to
get out of there!

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.270
The light house is on fire!

01:08:59.332 --> 01:09:00.765
There they are!

01:09:00.767 --> 01:09:03.466
Shoot at the explosives, now!

01:09:03.466 --> 01:09:06.227
No, Duke, you'll be killed!

01:09:06.233 --> 01:09:08.932
It's too late
for me, just shoot!

01:09:08.933 --> 01:09:11.303
You heard him, start shooting!

01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:26.470
Everyone take cover!

01:09:49.167 --> 01:09:50.466
That'll be
the end of the monster,

01:09:50.466 --> 01:09:52.426
and the terror
that's plagued us.

01:09:52.433 --> 01:09:56.273
It'll never be over,
the brain and the heart

01:09:57.667 --> 01:10:01.297
of the Frankenstein monster
can never be destroyed.

01:10:03.367 --> 01:10:04.927
Never be destroyed.

01:10:05.305 --> 01:10:11.779
