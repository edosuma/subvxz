<i>Lou:</i>
<i>Previously on "Heartland":</i>

00:03.022 --> 00:06.925
Ty: Amy, realistically,
can we afford this place?

00:06.959 --> 00:08.359
Do we have to be realistic?

00:09.661 --> 00:13.230
Something crazy out of the blue
just happened.

00:14.165 --> 00:16.767
We could put this money
down on the ranch.

00:16.802 --> 00:19.737
Yeah!
Yeah, you could.

00:19.771 --> 00:21.672
You worked hard
on this book deal.

00:21.706 --> 00:25.142
Don't make me the reason
that you don't go.

00:25.176 --> 00:26.510
<i>Georgie:</i>
<i>I changed my mind.</i>

00:26.578 --> 00:29.679
I think that you
and Katie should go

00:29.713 --> 00:31.281
on Lou's book tour.

00:31.316 --> 00:33.383
I am gonna miss you guys,
though.

00:33.451 --> 00:34.784
Come here.
(Laughs)

00:36.955 --> 00:38.989
(Truck rumbles)

00:42.427 --> 00:43.526
Amy:
You're here early.

00:43.561 --> 00:44.761
Lou and Peter
aren't expected back

00:44.795 --> 00:46.529
'til this afternoon.

00:46.564 --> 00:49.833
Tim: Yeah, I know. I was
hoping Ty was around.

00:50.935 --> 00:53.736
Well, actually, he's working
an extra shift at the clinic.

00:53.771 --> 00:55.071
Why, what's up?

00:55.105 --> 00:57.139
Well, he's supposed to be doing
some work on my truck,

00:57.174 --> 00:59.876
installing a new fuel tank,
replacing some parts,

00:59.910 --> 01:02.111
but he hasn't been
returning my calls.

01:02.145 --> 01:05.982
He's been working crazy hours.
I've barely seen him lately.

01:06.016 --> 01:08.650
His crazy hours
really aren't my problem.

01:08.685 --> 01:10.819
I'm paying him to do a job.

01:10.854 --> 01:11.920
Lou's gonna be getting home

01:11.989 --> 01:13.389
and she's gonna want
her truck back.

01:16.593 --> 01:18.660
(Hooves clop)

01:22.098 --> 01:24.165
Hey, what's going on here?

01:25.234 --> 01:28.704
Not a whole lot.
It's been pretty slow lately.

01:28.738 --> 01:30.672
Well, what about, uh,
your prince?

01:30.707 --> 01:33.308
I haven't really seen Ahmed
in a while.

01:33.342 --> 01:34.309
You know, honey,
you need the work,

01:34.343 --> 01:35.643
he's got the money.

01:35.711 --> 01:38.213
Pick up the phone,
give him a call.

01:38.247 --> 01:40.081
I don't know, dad.

01:40.116 --> 01:42.036
You can't just sit and wait
for things to happen.

01:42.051 --> 01:45.120
You've gotta be
a little more proactive.

01:45.154 --> 01:46.954
Well, tell Ty that
I'm looking for him, okay?

01:47.023 --> 01:48.689
Okay.

01:50.893 --> 01:52.292
(Sighs heavily)

01:55.898 --> 01:57.264
(Keypad beeps)

01:59.100 --> 02:03.437
<i>(Birds chirp, dogs bark,</i>
<i>cat meows)</i>

02:03.505 --> 02:07.041
I hope I'm not paying you
for this.

02:07.075 --> 02:11.345
Maybe you should cut back a bit
on those extra hours.

02:11.413 --> 02:13.947
And no, it's not a comment
on your performance.

02:13.981 --> 02:17.017
When you're awake,
you're great.

02:17.085 --> 02:19.353
I'd like to, Scott,
but I um... I can't.

02:19.387 --> 02:20.988
I need all the hours
I can get right now.

02:21.056 --> 02:23.357
(Cell phone rings)

02:23.425 --> 02:24.457
Hello?

02:25.593 --> 02:27.727
Yes it is.

02:27.762 --> 02:28.962
Sure can.

02:28.996 --> 02:30.363
Where?

02:32.733 --> 02:34.333
Uh, in an hour?
Well...

02:34.401 --> 02:37.003
we're kinda busy around here.

02:37.071 --> 02:40.306
Yeah... um, yeah,
we could fit you in.

02:40.374 --> 02:42.308
Okay.

02:42.376 --> 02:44.444
Impatient guy.

02:44.511 --> 02:47.213
Um, horse with a possible
vision problem.

02:48.348 --> 02:50.816
The owner wants us
to come take a look at him.

02:50.850 --> 02:52.851
Oh, hey, can we stop
for some coffee on the way?

02:55.255 --> 02:58.057
Now, where did you learn
how to bake like that?

02:58.124 --> 02:59.357
YouTube!

02:59.425 --> 03:00.859
There are videos
where you can learn

03:00.927 --> 03:02.494
pretty much anything, Jack.

03:02.562 --> 03:03.629
You don't say.

03:03.663 --> 03:04.897
Maybe you should've
watched a video

03:04.965 --> 03:07.265
on cleaning up as you go!

03:07.300 --> 03:08.767
Yeah, yeah.

03:08.802 --> 03:11.003
So...
what do you think?

03:11.037 --> 03:15.073
Well, you did a real
nice job on these.

03:15.141 --> 03:16.241
Are you sure?

03:16.309 --> 03:17.742
They have to be perfect!

03:17.810 --> 03:19.811
Lou is going to love them.

03:19.845 --> 03:21.980
Hey, look who I found
in the yard!

03:22.047 --> 03:24.082
Lou: Surprise!
Georgie: Lou! You're back!

03:24.117 --> 03:26.218
We didn't expect you
'til this afternoon.

03:26.252 --> 03:27.486
Well, I couldn't wait
to get home,

03:27.520 --> 03:29.821
so I took an earlier flight.

03:29.888 --> 03:31.255
Oh, and look at Katie!

03:31.323 --> 03:32.890
Look how much you've grown!

03:32.925 --> 03:34.558
Oh my! Mmm!

03:34.593 --> 03:35.827
So where's Peter?

03:35.894 --> 03:37.762
Oh, he had to go straight
back to work, honey.

03:37.796 --> 03:40.531
It was all kind of last minute.

03:40.565 --> 03:42.000
- That's a bummer!
- Yeah.

03:42.034 --> 03:44.636
When's he coming back?
Soon, I hope.

03:44.670 --> 03:46.803
Jack: Now this can't
be all your luggage.

03:46.838 --> 03:49.640
Oh no, she's got more
on the porch.

03:49.674 --> 03:51.142
Oh my gosh!

03:51.176 --> 03:52.943
I feel like
I've been away for ages!

03:53.011 --> 03:54.445
Tell me about it.

03:56.181 --> 03:57.581
I made them myself.

<i>Jack:</i>
<i>Yeah, and I can vouch for that.</i>

04:07.224 --> 04:08.825

Nothing!
No, I'm...

04:10.662 --> 04:12.062
I'm fine.

a famous author?

05:28.770 --> 05:30.137

Lou: Oh, that's me.

05:33.174 --> 05:34.242

05:34.309 --> 05:36.210
Shoot, Georgie,
um, it's Nicole.

05:36.278 --> 05:38.479
I should probably call her
in case something's wrong.

05:38.547 --> 05:39.908
Yeah, sure.
We can go see it later.

05:39.914 --> 05:41.115
Okay.

05:41.149 --> 05:42.649

to go see the horses.

Unbelievable!

06:14.348 --> 06:16.315
So whose horse is this again?

06:16.383 --> 06:17.583
Hollis Landon.

06:17.651 --> 06:19.752
Rich oil guy.

06:19.820 --> 06:20.787
(Cell phone rings)

06:20.854 --> 06:22.889

<i>Ty: Yup.</i>

06:26.660 --> 06:27.960
<i>Tim: We had a deal. You
haven't done a thing.</i>

<i>Tim: You've done nothing.</i>
<i>Ty: Yeah, I know, I know.</i>

06:29.096 --> 06:31.063
I just um...
I need some more time.

06:31.098 --> 06:32.498
Well, time's somethin'
I don't have!

06:32.532 --> 06:35.133
Lou's coming back
and she's gonna need her truck.

06:35.168 --> 06:36.402
Yeah, I know.

06:36.436 --> 06:37.836
I gotta get my hands on
some parts and then I'll-

06:37.870 --> 06:39.938
yeah, well, get on it!

06:43.242 --> 06:45.277
Everything okay?

06:46.279 --> 06:48.546
Yeah, just doing some work
on Tim's truck there

06:48.580 --> 06:51.082
and he was just calling
to uh...

06:51.117 --> 06:52.250
check up on me.

06:52.285 --> 06:55.120
He didn't sound too pleased.

Does he ever?

07:01.794 --> 07:04.696

that's good to hear.

07:04.730 --> 07:08.098

and help out if...

07:08.133 --> 07:09.400
Okay.

07:09.435 --> 07:10.568
I-I will.

07:11.570 --> 07:13.771

Rocks?

07:17.075 --> 07:18.643
leftover book tour stuff.

07:18.677 --> 07:20.010

07:20.045 --> 07:21.812
Nicole says everything is
under control at Maggie's

07:21.847 --> 07:23.047
and the Dude Ranch.

07:23.081 --> 07:24.882
It seems like she's doing
a bang-up job.

07:24.916 --> 07:27.284
It must be a relief
not to be so hands-on

07:27.319 --> 07:28.552
twenty-four seven.

07:28.586 --> 07:30.754
It sure is, yeah.
It's a great relief.

07:30.788 --> 07:32.289
Now...

07:32.324 --> 07:35.759
you deserve to relax
for a few days.

07:35.793 --> 07:37.694
You've been on the road
for weeks.

07:37.729 --> 07:39.730
I suppose you're right.

07:39.764 --> 07:41.297
I mean, things have been
going smoothly

07:41.332 --> 07:43.333
without you for this long,

07:43.368 --> 07:47.771
a few more days won't make
a difference, right?

07:49.340 --> 07:50.440
(Sighs softly)

07:51.476 --> 07:53.276
<i>Hollis:</i>
<i>I appreciate you coming out.</i>

07:53.344 --> 07:55.711
I've got a lot riding
on this guy.

07:55.746 --> 07:57.813
Well, he's a fine-looking
animal.

07:57.848 --> 07:58.969
Yeah, charger here qualified

07:59.016 --> 08:01.851
for the Hudson
barrel racing futurity.

08:01.886 --> 08:03.286
Well, that's a pretty big deal.

08:03.320 --> 08:04.820
That's in a couple of weeks,
right?

08:04.855 --> 08:07.357
Yeah, I just hope
he's fit enough to compete.

08:07.424 --> 08:09.325
Well, I don't see
any abnormalities,

08:09.393 --> 08:12.294
and... the cornea is clear.

08:12.362 --> 08:14.563
So, bottom line?

08:14.598 --> 08:15.865
Bottom line,

08:15.932 --> 08:18.100
there's nothing wrong
with your horse's eyesight.

08:20.970 --> 08:22.571
Isn't that good news?

08:22.639 --> 08:24.874
Charger here has been on
a real losing streak.

08:24.941 --> 08:26.475
Don't know why.

08:26.510 --> 08:27.742
I was hoping
it was just something physical

08:27.810 --> 08:29.244
and you could treat it.

08:29.312 --> 08:30.245
Well, it sounds like
you've still got time

08:30.313 --> 08:31.413
to figure it out.

08:31.480 --> 08:32.480
I don't think so.

08:32.548 --> 08:33.481
I'm either gonna have
to sell him,

08:33.549 --> 08:34.816
or auction him off.

08:34.850 --> 08:36.018
Why would you do that?

08:36.052 --> 08:38.253
He's not gonna pay off now.

08:39.705 --> 08:41.465
I know someone who might
be able to help you.

08:41.490 --> 08:43.357
No, I'd just be throwing
more money away at this point.

08:43.426 --> 08:44.759
Not necessarily.

08:44.794 --> 08:46.394
My fiancee is capable
of some pretty amazing results,

08:46.462 --> 08:47.796
and she could work with your-

08:47.830 --> 08:49.831
Ty, you made your point.

08:49.899 --> 08:50.899
That's okay.

08:50.966 --> 08:53.568
The kid's just trying
to help out.

08:53.636 --> 08:55.069
(Sighs)

08:56.238 --> 08:58.039
<i>(Truck rumbles)</i>

09:03.121 --> 09:04.321
You got time for a free dinner,

09:04.346 --> 09:07.148

to work on my truck?

09:07.215 --> 09:09.350
I'll get to it, okay?

09:09.418 --> 09:11.518
You told me
you needed the money.

09:11.586 --> 09:13.254
And I do.

09:13.322 --> 09:14.355
Well then...

09:14.389 --> 09:16.123
you've got a funny way
of showing it.

09:16.158 --> 09:19.693
The fuel tank's not even
off the pallet yet.

09:19.761 --> 09:21.261
What, you've been
checking up on me?!

09:21.295 --> 09:22.996
Don't try to turn this around.

09:23.030 --> 09:24.665
I'm doing you a favour

09:24.699 --> 09:26.533
and you're not
following through!

09:26.601 --> 09:31.705
And this is the kind of guy
that's gonna marry my daughter?

09:32.640 --> 09:33.706
You're right.

09:33.723 --> 09:35.084
They say girls marry
their fathers,

09:35.109 --> 09:36.609
so I should be careful
not to be too much like you!

09:36.677 --> 09:38.611
What? What?!

09:38.679 --> 09:40.713
What does that even mean?

09:42.249 --> 09:44.117
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

09:45.052 --> 09:47.687
It's not an excuse,
I've just...

09:47.754 --> 09:49.722
I had a bad day.
I didn't mean it.

09:49.756 --> 09:51.190
Fine.

09:52.125 --> 09:54.193
(Truck rumbles)

09:55.629 --> 09:56.696
Lou: By the end, I'd wake up

09:56.763 --> 09:58.430
and I wouldn't even know
where I was.

09:58.465 --> 10:00.399
<i>Lou: Here you go, dad.</i>
<i>Amy: Really? Wow!</i>

10:00.433 --> 10:02.067
Georgie:
You went to twenty cities?

10:02.102 --> 10:03.135
Lou:
I sure did!

10:03.203 --> 10:04.704
From Wolfville
to Campbell River.

10:04.738 --> 10:06.105
Grandpa:
Whoa! That's a lot of miles!

10:06.139 --> 10:08.840
Lou: That's a lot of bad
coffee and stale donuts.

10:08.875 --> 10:10.109
Tim:
Well, here's to you, Lou.

10:10.143 --> 10:12.111
No, you guys.

10:12.145 --> 10:14.579
And let's hope some of that
good luck rubs off on Amy

10:14.614 --> 10:16.715
'cause she could sure
use it right now.

10:16.749 --> 10:17.983
What do you mean?

10:18.018 --> 10:20.386
Oh, business is a little slow
around here.

10:20.420 --> 10:22.021
Now is not the time, Tim.

10:22.055 --> 10:23.788
I'm just saying, her client list
has all but dried up

10:23.823 --> 10:25.624
<i>since the accident, so...</i>

10:25.658 --> 10:27.458
She could really use
the business.

10:27.493 --> 10:28.960
Is that true, Amy?

10:28.995 --> 10:30.395
And Ty, you know,

10:30.429 --> 10:33.598
he's turning his nose up
at free money.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.033
It's good to have
you back, Lou.

10:35.067 --> 10:36.034
Thanks.

10:36.068 --> 10:37.869
<i>Ty:</i>
<i>Excuse me.</i>

10:37.904 --> 10:39.737
I need my truck back!

10:39.771 --> 10:42.173
I said I'd do it and I will.

10:43.108 --> 10:44.509
<i>(Amy sighs angrily)</i>

10:45.710 --> 10:48.112
Are things really that bad?

10:50.715 --> 10:52.150
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>Hey! Hey!</i>

10:52.217 --> 10:53.317
Don't listen to him, okay?

10:53.352 --> 10:55.520
He's just trying
to get under your skin.

10:55.554 --> 10:58.155
Yeah, well,
mission accomplished.

10:58.189 --> 11:00.257
The thing is, Amy,
he's got a point.

11:00.324 --> 11:02.192
I said I'd have his truck ready
by the time Lou got back,

11:02.226 --> 11:03.661
and I haven't even ordered
the parts yet!

11:03.695 --> 11:05.863
Hey, don't worry about it,
okay?

11:05.897 --> 11:07.164
You'll get it done.

11:07.231 --> 11:08.432
Yeah...

11:08.499 --> 11:10.419
You're putting way too much
pressure on yourself.

11:10.468 --> 11:12.002
You're juggling
all these extra hours

11:12.037 --> 11:13.403
at work and school?

11:13.438 --> 11:16.206
I'm not doing a good job of it.

11:16.240 --> 11:18.942
I found out today
I failed two midterms.

11:19.009 --> 11:20.544
Oh, Ty...

11:20.578 --> 11:23.146
earning some extra money
is not worth that.

11:23.214 --> 11:24.281
Amy, I'm trying to come up
with my share

11:24.315 --> 11:26.283
of the down payment.

11:26.317 --> 11:28.318
That's what I'm trying to do
in all of this!

11:28.386 --> 11:30.219
I'm the one who doesn't know
where my next job

11:30.253 --> 11:31.721
is coming from!

11:31.755 --> 11:34.290
So if there's anyone who might
not be pulling their weight,

11:34.357 --> 11:35.291
it's me!

11:35.358 --> 11:37.326
Don't say that, Amy.

11:38.261 --> 11:39.996
Hey, we're gonna make it, okay?

11:40.064 --> 11:42.098
It's gonna be fine.

11:43.200 --> 11:46.202
We'll figure this out, okay?

11:46.269 --> 11:47.636
Yeah...

11:49.206 --> 11:50.806
I'll see ya.

11:52.000 --> 11:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

12:05.175 --> 12:07.055
I'm sorry your "Welcome Home"
dinner was ruined,

12:07.078 --> 12:08.645
but at least now you know.

12:08.713 --> 12:09.979
Listen, here's the thing:

12:10.013 --> 12:12.415
I think people assume
you're still recuperating.

12:12.483 --> 12:14.183
Yeah, I'm sure it'll pick up.

12:14.251 --> 12:16.185
Yeah, it will
if we get the word out!

12:16.220 --> 12:17.487
People need to know
that you're recovered

12:17.521 --> 12:19.222
and open for business.

12:19.289 --> 12:20.990
What about a comeback clinic
to get yourself out there

12:21.057 --> 12:22.658
to prospective clients?

12:22.692 --> 12:24.160
Yeah, a clinic might be good.

12:24.228 --> 12:26.328
So you're in?
Great!

12:26.362 --> 12:28.042
I'll handle the promotion
and registration.

12:28.064 --> 12:30.265
No, Lou, you've already
got too much going on.

12:30.299 --> 12:31.533
No, no, no, I don't!

12:31.567 --> 12:33.168
Yes, you do, and now that
you're a busy writer...

12:33.202 --> 12:35.771
Look, I can deal with it
all on my own.

12:35.839 --> 12:38.641
Okay. Are you sure though?
Because I'm happy to. I-

12:38.675 --> 12:42.044
Lou, I'm sure, okay?
But thanks for the great idea.

12:42.078 --> 12:43.478
Okay.

12:47.216 --> 12:49.384
(Approaching footsteps)

12:49.418 --> 12:52.254
Well, I'm finally here
for the grand tour!

12:53.889 --> 12:55.089
Wow...

12:55.124 --> 12:56.691
Isn't it the best?

12:57.627 --> 13:01.129
You have certainly
made it your own.

13:01.163 --> 13:02.897
Well, I meant to clean it
before you got here,

13:02.931 --> 13:05.166
but then you came home early.

13:05.200 --> 13:06.634
Georgie, I'm really sorry
I wasn't here

13:06.669 --> 13:08.402
to help you set up.

13:08.436 --> 13:10.204
It's fine.
Peter helped me.

13:10.238 --> 13:11.673
Lou: I know, but it's
kind of a big deal,

13:11.707 --> 13:14.142
your first room.

13:14.176 --> 13:16.610
Hey, how about some cute
little gingham curtains?

13:19.181 --> 13:22.349
Um...
could I think about it?

13:22.384 --> 13:23.484
Sure.

13:23.518 --> 13:25.519
Well, one thing I can do
is help you

13:25.554 --> 13:27.020
get a little more organized.

13:27.055 --> 13:29.290
Actually, um...

13:29.324 --> 13:30.724
I kinda like it like this.

13:31.993 --> 13:33.694
Uh, okay...

13:33.728 --> 13:35.461
but, you know, one thing
about having your own room

13:35.496 --> 13:37.197
is you have to keep it tidy.

13:37.231 --> 13:39.365
Georgie: Since when?
Lou: Since always.

13:39.400 --> 13:41.367
Georgie: Okay, I'll clean it.
Lou: When?

13:41.402 --> 13:43.336
Tomorrow, after school.

13:43.370 --> 13:44.404
Promise!

13:46.140 --> 13:47.808
Yeah, thanks for
letting me know, Scott.

13:47.842 --> 13:48.941
Okay.

13:48.975 --> 13:50.710
Yeah, bye.
(Knock at the door)

13:50.744 --> 13:52.945
Come in!

13:52.979 --> 13:55.147
Caleb: Tim here? I saw
his truck in the yard.

13:55.182 --> 13:58.884
No, I'm just doing some work
on it for him.

13:58.919 --> 14:00.253
Don't ask, man.
Don't ask.

14:00.287 --> 14:02.222
- Brewski?
- Yeah!

14:02.256 --> 14:05.657
Thanks for that, I needed this.

14:05.692 --> 14:07.226
Bad day?

14:08.561 --> 14:10.763
You know what, man?
I'm just ticked off!

14:10.831 --> 14:12.364
I've been busting my ass
working extra hours

14:12.398 --> 14:14.166
for peanuts!

14:14.234 --> 14:15.601
And then today,
Scott and I went and checked out

14:15.668 --> 14:16.836
this great barrel-racing horse,

14:16.870 --> 14:19.538
he was a... futurity,
or...

14:20.506 --> 14:22.073
Futurity horse?

14:22.141 --> 14:23.242
Whatever.

14:23.309 --> 14:24.543
I mean he's gonna end up
on some meat truck

14:24.611 --> 14:26.177
'cause some rich oil guy
wants to get rid of him.

14:26.212 --> 14:27.912
Now, hold on just a sec.

14:27.980 --> 14:29.348
What are you talking about?

14:29.382 --> 14:30.582
I don't know,

14:30.617 --> 14:31.816
he was on about
some Hudson futurity thing.

14:31.851 --> 14:33.585
He didn't wanna waste
any more money on him.

14:33.653 --> 14:34.919
Well, it's not going
on a meat truck

14:34.987 --> 14:36.154
if it's a futurity horse.

14:36.222 --> 14:39.257
The guy's gonna sell it
for big bucks.

14:39.324 --> 14:40.658
What's wrong with the horse?

14:40.692 --> 14:42.927
Nothing, as far as I can tell.

14:42.995 --> 14:45.096
Huh. Well, this could be
a real opportunity.

14:45.131 --> 14:46.097
<i>Ty:</i>
<i>Wait. Wait a second.</i>

14:46.165 --> 14:47.486
What is a futurity horse,
anyways?

14:47.532 --> 14:49.033
Well, there's these foals,

14:49.068 --> 14:50.568
and they're called
futurity nominated.

14:50.636 --> 14:51.736
When they're born,

14:51.771 --> 14:53.071
their owners put money
into a big pot,

14:53.139 --> 14:54.872
betting that one day
their horse will be a winner.

14:54.906 --> 14:56.274
Ty:
So this is like a big deal?

14:56.308 --> 14:59.877
Caleb: It is, it's huge.
Lots of money on the line.

14:59.944 --> 15:01.579
If a regular guy could get
his hands on a horse like that,

15:01.647 --> 15:03.614
he could stand to win big.

15:03.682 --> 15:05.249
Yeah, or he could just buy
a lottery ticket.

15:05.284 --> 15:07.351
No, no, this is way
better odds.

15:08.487 --> 15:09.720
(Sighs)

15:09.788 --> 15:11.454
Thanks for the tip,
I'm gonna go check it out.

15:11.522 --> 15:13.556
I mean,
this could be a gold mine!

15:16.928 --> 15:18.561
<i>Lou:</i>
<i>Just who I wanted to see!</i>

15:18.629 --> 15:19.863
Amy:
Yeah? What's up?

15:19.931 --> 15:21.772
I couldn't sleep last night.
You know, jet lag.

15:21.833 --> 15:23.100
So I thought instead
of just laying there

15:23.168 --> 15:24.401
staring off into the dark,

15:24.435 --> 15:26.436
I could check into a few things
for the clinic.

15:26.470 --> 15:27.470
Lou, I told you-

15:27.538 --> 15:28.871
I know, I know, I'm too busy

15:28.906 --> 15:30.467
and you wanna handle it
all on your own,

15:30.508 --> 15:32.074
but I found this online system

15:32.109 --> 15:33.910
that handles
the registration process for you

15:33.977 --> 15:35.445
and you won't have
to do a thing!

15:35.479 --> 15:37.580
Wow! You really are
all over this.

15:37.648 --> 15:39.349
I was thinking maybe
I could streamline

15:39.383 --> 15:41.418
the process for you.

15:41.452 --> 15:43.085
Lou, thanks, really,
but-

15:43.120 --> 15:44.453
but I could set up
an online presence

15:44.521 --> 15:45.521
and attract lots of traffic

15:45.555 --> 15:48.257
using search engine
optimization.

15:48.292 --> 15:49.325
See how much you need me?

15:49.359 --> 15:51.227
It's an Internet
marketing strategy.

15:51.261 --> 15:52.328
And don't get mad,

15:52.395 --> 15:54.363
but I checked
the Hudson arena schedule

15:54.397 --> 15:56.598
and there are
some dates available.

15:56.633 --> 15:58.567
Lou, this is great, it is,

15:58.601 --> 16:00.402
but I'm gonna hold the clinic
at Heartland.

16:00.437 --> 16:02.504
Why? The arena can handle
more people.

16:02.539 --> 16:03.605
Yeah, but for starters,

16:03.640 --> 16:05.207
we can't afford
to rent the arena!

16:05.241 --> 16:06.842
And I want to have
a small class size,

16:06.909 --> 16:08.744
so I can give
individual attention.

16:08.778 --> 16:09.978
Okay, I hear that.

16:10.046 --> 16:11.714
So if I agree to hold the clinic
at Heartland,

16:11.748 --> 16:13.515
will you let me handle
the planning details?

16:13.550 --> 16:14.817
Lou, we've been over this!

16:14.851 --> 16:16.418
You already have
your plate full!

16:16.453 --> 16:18.586
Lou: No, I don't.
Nicole has Maggie's

16:18.620 --> 16:19.900
and the Dude Ranch
under control,

16:19.922 --> 16:20.922
the girls are fine,

16:20.957 --> 16:23.291
and I need some time to just...

16:23.326 --> 16:25.460
get my creative juices
flowing again.

16:25.494 --> 16:27.395
Don't you just want
some time to relax?

16:27.429 --> 16:29.797
I am relaxed!

16:31.367 --> 16:33.368
I just wanna help.

16:33.402 --> 16:34.802
Let me do this.

16:36.037 --> 16:37.438
Fine, okay.

16:37.473 --> 16:38.639
You are not gonna regret this!

16:38.674 --> 16:39.707
And the upside?

16:39.775 --> 16:40.842
Now you can just focus
on the content

16:40.876 --> 16:42.176
and leave the details to me.

16:42.244 --> 16:44.364
You're gonna have clients
lined up before you know it!

16:45.681 --> 16:48.182
Ty:
What're you lookin' at?

16:48.250 --> 16:49.851
<i>Caleb:</i>
<i>That is charger.</i>

16:49.885 --> 16:51.785
<i>It turns out</i>
<i>he's the real deal.</i>

16:51.819 --> 16:52.987
I've been asking around
about him.

16:53.054 --> 16:54.788
There's a lot of people
with their eye on him.

16:54.822 --> 16:56.390
What, are you thinking
about buying him?

16:56.424 --> 16:58.492
Mm, it depends.

17:01.462 --> 17:05.266
What if you and I were to
go in on it together?

17:06.329 --> 17:07.410
What, you're kidding, right?

17:07.435 --> 17:08.968
No, for real!

17:09.002 --> 17:10.470
We could split the costs
and the winnings,

17:10.538 --> 17:12.238
fifty-fifty.

17:12.306 --> 17:13.707
That sounds pretty risky, man.

17:13.741 --> 17:16.175
Well, no risk, no reward.

17:17.111 --> 17:19.646
You know, last year's barrel
racing futurity in Vegas

17:19.714 --> 17:21.580
was worth a hundred grand.

17:21.616 --> 17:22.549
(Blows out breath)

17:22.617 --> 17:24.884
Well, that's big money.

17:24.952 --> 17:28.186
Are you sure you don't want
a piece of the action?

17:28.222 --> 17:29.722
How much?

17:29.756 --> 17:31.490
Five grand.

17:31.558 --> 17:32.625
Each.

17:32.659 --> 17:33.893
(Snorts)
I- no, man.

17:33.928 --> 17:35.528
That's pretty much all the money
I have right now-

17:35.595 --> 17:37.830
look, just-just-
just think about it.

17:37.864 --> 17:39.532
You've gotta spend money
to make money, right?

17:39.566 --> 17:41.434
I know, I know, I just...

17:41.501 --> 17:43.469
I-I can't, though.

17:44.471 --> 17:46.271
Wow. Okay.

17:46.339 --> 17:47.907
That's too bad.

17:47.974 --> 17:49.374
You're kinda passing up
on the opportunity

17:49.443 --> 17:50.743
of a lifetime.

17:51.711 --> 17:53.412
If you're sure...

17:56.715 --> 17:58.283
Amy:
Hey, Georgie!

17:58.351 --> 17:59.451
Hey, Amy.

17:59.485 --> 18:00.618
You wanna help me prep
for the clinic?

18:00.653 --> 18:02.254
Yeah, sure.
I'll be right out.

18:02.322 --> 18:03.355
Okay, perfect.

18:08.328 --> 18:09.727
(Door bangs shut)

18:12.432 --> 18:14.298
Looks likes somebody had
a good day at school.

18:14.328 --> 18:15.409
Yeah, I'm gonna go help Amy.

18:15.434 --> 18:16.734
Aren't you forgetting
something?

18:16.802 --> 18:18.970
Um, don't think so.

18:19.037 --> 18:20.237
Your room?

18:20.305 --> 18:23.975
- I'll do it later!
- Georgie, you made a promise.

18:24.009 --> 18:27.178
Well, you do what Lou says.

18:27.212 --> 18:28.179
(Groans)

18:28.213 --> 18:30.381
And take your sister with you.

18:30.415 --> 18:31.949
(Aggravated growl)

18:33.385 --> 18:34.452
Fine!

18:36.088 --> 18:38.422
Are you... doin' okay?

18:38.490 --> 18:40.958
Yeah, I'm fine.
Why?

18:40.993 --> 18:41.993
Well...
I don't know,

18:42.027 --> 18:44.028
you just seem a little touchy.

18:44.096 --> 18:46.296
Kids need routine, grandpa,
you know that.

18:46.364 --> 18:47.764
And I'm not sure
she had much of one

18:47.832 --> 18:48.932
while I was away.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.567
Now I have to come home
and be the bad guy!

18:50.602 --> 18:53.637
We haven't exactly
let her run wild around here,

18:53.705 --> 18:55.071
you know!

18:56.808 --> 18:58.542
(Groans)

19:01.445 --> 19:02.845
Nah!

19:05.516 --> 19:07.583
Ugh!

19:07.618 --> 19:08.885
What-

19:09.820 --> 19:11.687
<i>(hard thud)</i>

19:12.623 --> 19:14.357
<i>Oh, Katie!</i>

19:16.994 --> 19:18.294
(Sighs heavily)

19:18.329 --> 19:20.596
This sucks!
This really sucks!

19:20.631 --> 19:22.364
(Sniffs)

19:25.002 --> 19:26.669
I thought Georgie
was coming out.

19:26.703 --> 19:28.604
Lou:
Oh, she's up cleaning her room.

19:28.639 --> 19:30.006
Hey, Amy, I was thinking,

19:30.040 --> 19:32.808
what if we held a three-day
clinic instead?

19:32.843 --> 19:34.510
Lou, I told you
I want to keep this clinic

19:34.545 --> 19:35.844
small and contained!

19:35.878 --> 19:37.546
I know, I know,
but just hear me out.

19:37.580 --> 19:38.780
You have to admit that
that kind of thinking

19:38.814 --> 19:40.382
is a little limited.

19:40.417 --> 19:42.317
You know, it's good to push
outside your comfort zone.

19:42.352 --> 19:43.919
You're doing what you do.

19:43.953 --> 19:44.986
What do I do?

19:45.021 --> 19:46.388
What you always do!

19:46.423 --> 19:47.722
Just because I agreed
you could help

19:47.757 --> 19:49.158
doesn't mean you can take over!

19:49.192 --> 19:50.492
I'm not, Amy!

19:50.560 --> 19:52.440
But remember that this clinic
is about marketing

19:52.494 --> 19:54.996
and getting the word out there
to as many people as possible.

19:55.031 --> 19:56.798
And, you know,
there are the entry fees

19:56.832 --> 19:58.232
to consider as well.

19:58.267 --> 19:59.801
You know, this is exactly why
I didn't want your help

19:59.869 --> 20:00.802
in the first place.

20:00.870 --> 20:02.303
Lou:
What?!

20:02.371 --> 20:04.039
Because this clinic is about
helping people and horses, Lou,

20:04.073 --> 20:05.473
not numbers!

20:07.043 --> 20:08.176
Where are you going?

20:08.243 --> 20:10.311
Dinner's almost ready!

20:11.580 --> 20:13.247
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>I just had to get out of there.</i>

20:13.282 --> 20:14.449
She's driving me crazy,

20:14.516 --> 20:16.517
saying this clinic
is all about marketing!

20:16.552 --> 20:18.453
(Cell phone rings)

20:18.487 --> 20:19.687
(Sighs)

20:19.754 --> 20:22.957
Speaking of driving
a person crazy.

20:23.024 --> 20:24.358
Oh...

20:24.393 --> 20:26.526
That's it!

20:26.561 --> 20:27.895
What?

20:27.929 --> 20:29.396
<i>Ty: I'm gonna order
these parts right now,</i>

20:29.464 --> 20:32.566
get it done,
and get your dad off my back.

20:32.634 --> 20:35.002
Yeah, he can be a pain, huh?

20:36.237 --> 20:38.171
Look, Amy,

20:38.239 --> 20:40.540
I know Lou can be frustrating
sometimes.

20:40.609 --> 20:42.075
It sounds to me like
she's just overly invested

20:42.143 --> 20:43.477
in this whole clinic thing.

20:43.544 --> 20:44.777
Yeah, she is.

20:44.812 --> 20:47.547
Ty: But in the long
run, it'll be worth it.

20:47.615 --> 20:51.218
Everything Lou organizes
turns out to be a success.

20:51.285 --> 20:52.719
Yeah, you're right.

20:52.786 --> 20:54.087
Ty: Do you know if she's
got the website up yet?

20:54.122 --> 20:56.123
I think so,
but I haven't looked at it.

20:56.190 --> 20:57.624
Here we go...

20:59.292 --> 21:02.294
Wow! This looks pretty good!

21:05.099 --> 21:06.298
Oh no.

21:08.478 --> 21:10.079
Amy: So I finally checked
out the website.

21:10.104 --> 21:12.105
You totally ignored
all my input!

21:12.172 --> 21:13.840
Amy, you asked me
to handle the details,

21:13.907 --> 21:15.007
so that's what I did.

21:15.041 --> 21:17.143
No, Lou, you begged me
to let you help!

21:17.210 --> 21:19.445
Look, I hate to say this,
but your career is in trouble.

21:19.479 --> 21:20.946
I'm the one with
the business background

21:21.014 --> 21:22.014
and I'm just trying to help!

21:22.081 --> 21:23.682
Lou, this is not about you!

21:23.750 --> 21:25.384
This is my reputation
on the line,

21:25.452 --> 21:26.885
and I said no
to a three-day clinic

21:26.953 --> 21:28.387
and no to big classes!

21:28.455 --> 21:30.095
And that's exactly
what you've advertised!

21:30.157 --> 21:33.525
Well, do you know what?!
You got your wish!

21:35.161 --> 21:37.562
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>Only three people signed up?</i>

21:37.596 --> 21:39.364
(Sighs heavily)

21:39.398 --> 21:40.398
Wow.

21:40.432 --> 21:43.368
Amy! I-I'm sorry!

21:43.435 --> 21:44.670
<i>Do you want me to cancel?</i>

21:44.737 --> 21:47.172
And what, punish the people
who did sign up?

21:47.206 --> 21:49.874
Well, it's only three people,
it hardly seems worth it.

21:49.908 --> 21:52.377
Yeah, maybe not from
a marketing perspective!

21:52.411 --> 21:55.246
But that's never what this
was about for me, Lou!

21:55.314 --> 21:56.514
So I'm gonna be a professional

21:56.549 --> 21:58.949
and I'm gonna put on
the best clinic that I can!

22:04.056 --> 22:06.423
What happened?
You didn't clean up.

22:06.457 --> 22:08.492
Well, I started to,

22:08.560 --> 22:10.561
but then I had to do
some homework

22:10.595 --> 22:12.663
and Katie made
some of this mess.

22:12.698 --> 22:14.065
Georgie, Katie is three.

22:14.099 --> 22:16.300
It's your room,
so it's your responsibility.

22:16.334 --> 22:18.836
Well, if it's my room,
then I wanna keep it like this!

22:18.870 --> 22:19.837
Lou: Well then, maybe you
should start spending

22:19.871 --> 22:21.471
all of your free time up here.

22:21.506 --> 22:23.507
Are you grounding me
to my room?!

22:23.541 --> 22:24.974
Lou:
No, no, I wouldn't say that.

22:25.009 --> 22:27.377
But you should take some time
to think about your actions.

26:41.747 --> 26:43.214

26:44.350 --> 26:45.416
not following through
on a promise

26:45.484 --> 26:46.950
is a very big deal.

26:47.018 --> 26:48.252
I was clear about
the consequences-

26:48.319 --> 26:50.988
Lou, you're starting to sound
a bit like your blog,

26:51.055 --> 26:52.523
you know that?

26:52.591 --> 26:54.057
Lou:
Well, that's just great!

26:54.092 --> 26:57.194
Because apparently my blog is
nothing but sentimental rambling

26:57.262 --> 26:59.129
that should never have
been turned into a book!

26:59.197 --> 27:01.899
What?
Why do you say that?

27:01.966 --> 27:06.003
I have to get these
out to the clients.

27:09.407 --> 27:12.276

27:12.343 --> 27:13.810

27:13.844 --> 27:17.247
when people have been apart
for awhile.

27:17.282 --> 27:19.416

27:19.450 --> 27:20.617

27:20.684 --> 27:22.285
after being in France
for a bit,

27:22.352 --> 27:25.655
well, we have to figure out

27:25.723 --> 27:28.357
how to be around
each other again.

27:28.392 --> 27:29.859
So, what do you do?

27:29.927 --> 27:33.496
Well, I say yes
more than usual.

27:33.531 --> 27:35.431
Oh, never mind.

27:35.465 --> 27:37.266
The thing is, Georgie,
it takes time,

27:37.334 --> 27:40.202
but you both have
to make an effort.

27:41.905 --> 27:45.308

27:45.342 --> 27:48.444
it wasn't Rocky's fault.

27:48.478 --> 27:51.513

But that doesn't change
how I feel.

28:12.534 --> 28:14.970
by a frightened horse,

28:15.004 --> 28:17.572
and when I came to...

28:17.606 --> 28:19.007
I couldn't see.

28:20.576 --> 28:24.912
It was the most terrifying thing
I have ever had to face,

28:24.947 --> 28:27.314
and I blamed the horse.

28:27.349 --> 28:32.019
<i>Even after I could see,</i>
<i>I pretended I was fine,</i>

28:32.053 --> 28:35.022
<i>but I couldn't face riding.</i>

28:35.056 --> 28:39.460
I really thought my work
with horses was over.

28:41.262 --> 28:43.464
I really only got over it...

28:43.531 --> 28:46.233
when I was forced
to ride again.

28:47.469 --> 28:49.536
<i>(Clattering noise)</i>

28:56.177 --> 28:59.813
But the good news is,
when I did,

28:59.847 --> 29:03.149
that fear just fell away.

29:03.183 --> 29:05.351
And now you're back
teaching clinics.

29:05.386 --> 29:06.786
So...

29:06.821 --> 29:08.755
if I can do it,

29:08.789 --> 29:10.189
so can you.

29:11.291 --> 29:12.959
Come on, what do you say?

29:12.994 --> 29:15.661
You wanna give it another try?

29:16.596 --> 29:17.630
(Laughs)

29:19.433 --> 29:21.501
(Truck rumbles)

29:23.303 --> 29:25.938
Ty:
Look, Tim, I'm late for work.

29:25.972 --> 29:28.607
I should have your truck done
by tomorrow afternoon.

29:28.642 --> 29:29.875
My-my what?

29:32.111 --> 29:33.178
Oh!

29:33.246 --> 29:35.915
Yeah, I forgot
I even owned a truck.

29:35.982 --> 29:37.382
Gimme my keys.

29:39.385 --> 29:41.086
What's going on?

29:42.221 --> 29:44.657
<i>Tim: Lou's gonna need her
truck back by this afternoon.</i>

29:44.691 --> 29:46.124
Try not to screw that up, too.

29:46.159 --> 29:47.625
What are you talking about?!

29:47.660 --> 29:51.296
Tim: I'm tired of waiting for
you to get your act together.

29:51.330 --> 29:53.098
I'm gonna take it to my guy.

29:53.166 --> 29:54.099
Are you kidding me?!

29:54.167 --> 29:55.534
No, I'm not kidding you, Ty!

29:55.601 --> 29:57.869
We had a deal
and you let me down.

29:57.937 --> 29:59.071
Ty:
Tim, I just got all the parts!

29:59.138 --> 30:00.658
I'm taking time off work
this afternoon

30:00.706 --> 30:01.639
to get it done!

30:01.707 --> 30:03.108
Yeah, sure you are.

30:04.242 --> 30:05.610
(Engine revs)

30:07.145 --> 30:08.646
Ty:
Thanks!

30:09.815 --> 30:11.182
(Sighs)

30:17.590 --> 30:19.523
You okay?

30:19.558 --> 30:20.958
Mm-hmm.

30:21.960 --> 30:23.194
All right, when you're ready,

30:23.228 --> 30:24.928
you can start lunging him.

30:24.963 --> 30:26.964
Okay.

30:26.998 --> 30:29.066
Come on, Rocky.

30:32.337 --> 30:33.737
That's it!

30:33.805 --> 30:35.172
Keep him moving.

30:37.308 --> 30:38.742
Martha:
Come on... (Clucks tongue)

30:39.711 --> 30:40.978
Whoa!
(Gasps fearfully)

30:41.012 --> 30:42.646
Whoa...

30:42.680 --> 30:44.915
Are you okay?

30:44.949 --> 30:47.283
I-I-I don't-
I don't think I'm ready.

30:47.318 --> 30:50.954
Hey, you're making
great progress, okay?

30:51.022 --> 30:52.455
He was watching you
very closely,

30:52.490 --> 30:53.656
<i>and when you stumbled</i>

30:53.690 --> 30:55.251
<i>he turned in to face you</i>
<i>like he should.</i>

30:55.259 --> 30:57.193
Why don't you try it again?

30:57.228 --> 30:58.628
Okay.

31:02.199 --> 31:03.266
Come on!

31:04.935 --> 31:06.002
(Martha clucks her tongue)

31:08.005 --> 31:09.672
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>There you go!</i>

31:09.706 --> 31:10.973
<i>That looks great!</i>

31:11.008 --> 31:12.089
<i>There! There, you see that?</i>

31:12.109 --> 31:13.475
You see his ear
turning in to you?

31:13.510 --> 31:15.011
He's licking his lips,
that's good.

31:15.078 --> 31:16.646
He's ready to join up.

31:17.580 --> 31:19.448
Come on!

31:19.516 --> 31:20.883
(Sighs heavily)

31:22.552 --> 31:23.519
<i>(Participants applaud)</i>

31:23.553 --> 31:24.954
Hey.

31:26.222 --> 31:27.422
There we go, huh?

31:27.457 --> 31:29.458
Amy:
Now, when you're ready...

31:29.492 --> 31:32.161
<i>I want you to get on him.</i>

31:39.469 --> 31:42.237
We're all standing right here
and you're fine.

31:43.572 --> 31:44.973
Just stay calm.

31:46.175 --> 31:47.776
<i>You can do this, Martha.</i>

31:59.554 --> 32:00.954
(Laughs)

32:02.791 --> 32:04.858
Good boy.
Come on.

32:08.329 --> 32:09.362
There.

32:10.731 --> 32:12.465
(Laughs)

32:20.641 --> 32:21.675
(Groans)

32:24.745 --> 32:26.312
(Thuds)

32:26.379 --> 32:28.081
(Sighs heavily)

32:36.056 --> 32:37.623
Amy: Hey.
Lou: Hey.

32:37.691 --> 32:39.325
Everybody just left.

32:39.359 --> 32:42.194
I knew I shouldn't have gone
on that book tour.

32:42.262 --> 32:43.462
You weren't ready
and I-

32:43.530 --> 32:46.198
no, Lou, I didn't want you
to stay because of me.

32:46.233 --> 32:48.500
I could've helped you!

32:48.568 --> 32:51.903
This is something that
I needed to do on my own.

32:51.938 --> 32:53.372
And you did.

32:53.406 --> 32:56.574
And look what you were able
to do for those people today.

32:56.609 --> 32:58.476
It felt pretty good.

32:58.544 --> 33:01.646
But it didn't fix anything.

33:01.714 --> 33:03.949
No clients means no career.

33:03.983 --> 33:06.251
This is my fault, Amy.

33:06.318 --> 33:07.819
I used this clinic
to distract myself

33:07.854 --> 33:09.520
from my own failures.

33:09.588 --> 33:11.522
What failures, Lou?

33:11.557 --> 33:14.292
The book tour.
It was...

33:14.360 --> 33:16.294
a huge flop!

33:16.362 --> 33:18.329
My books didn't sell,

33:18.397 --> 33:19.464
and I was so awful

33:19.531 --> 33:21.098
that Peter couldn't stand it
anymore,

33:21.133 --> 33:22.900
and he had to run back to work!

33:22.968 --> 33:24.201
Oh, Lou...

33:24.245 --> 33:26.046
And then I get home
and discover that Maggie's

33:26.071 --> 33:27.639
and the Dude Ranch ran smoothly

33:27.706 --> 33:28.705
while I was gone,

33:28.740 --> 33:30.241
and even Georgie seemed happier

33:30.275 --> 33:31.242
while I was away.

33:31.276 --> 33:32.476
No, that's not true.

33:32.510 --> 33:35.345
Georgie missed you like crazy.
We all did!

33:36.648 --> 33:39.683
Lou, I'm really sorry
that things didn't go well.

33:39.751 --> 33:41.118
And I'm sorry to be
dumping this on you

33:41.186 --> 33:44.255
when you're the one
who needs my support.

33:45.189 --> 33:46.757
I brought your truck back.

33:46.791 --> 33:47.857
Thanks.

33:48.959 --> 33:50.460
How was the clinic?

33:50.528 --> 33:51.928
Lou did a really great job.

33:51.962 --> 33:53.430
Not true.

33:53.498 --> 33:55.299
I made a mess of it.
(Laughs wryly)

33:57.001 --> 33:58.302
Ty:
That bad?

33:58.336 --> 33:59.703
Well, the clinic
was really rewarding,

33:59.737 --> 34:01.871
but three people showed up.

34:03.107 --> 34:04.407
Amy...

34:04.441 --> 34:07.110
Hey, it's gonna be okay.

34:08.813 --> 34:11.414
Ty, what if it doesn't?

34:11.481 --> 34:13.983
We might have to change
our plans.

34:14.051 --> 34:15.284
I don't know what's next for me

34:15.351 --> 34:18.487
and you're killing yourself
with these crazy hours.

34:18.522 --> 34:19.621
I just don't know if the ranch

34:19.656 --> 34:22.525
is in the cards for us
right now.

34:22.559 --> 34:23.693
No, Amy, this is something
that you-

34:23.726 --> 34:26.195
Ty, we have to be realistic!

34:26.228 --> 34:28.130
We've got years to save
for a down payment,

34:28.164 --> 34:31.734
but right now,
you need to focus on school.

34:31.768 --> 34:34.002
Everything else can wait.

34:34.938 --> 34:37.472
Hey, I'll figure it out.
(Sighs)

34:44.915 --> 34:46.649
<i>Sometimes...</i>

34:46.683 --> 34:51.954
when people are upset,
they try and control things.

34:51.987 --> 34:55.690
And by "people,"
you mean you, right?

34:55.726 --> 34:57.626
I admit, it's not
one of my best traits.

34:57.661 --> 35:00.863
But don't tell anyone
I said that.

35:00.930 --> 35:02.698
I was watching the clinic
from my window

35:02.733 --> 35:05.033
and it looked kind of lame.

35:05.068 --> 35:06.335
<i>Why weren't there more people?</i>

35:06.369 --> 35:08.103
You're looking at
the reason why.

35:08.137 --> 35:09.471
I got so caught up
in the big picture,

35:09.505 --> 35:12.241
I forgot to get the word out
to prospective clients.

35:12.275 --> 35:13.541
<i>Georgie:</i>
<i>That's weird.</i>

35:13.576 --> 35:16.011
You're usually really good
at organizing stuff.

35:17.280 --> 35:21.115
Sorry the clinic
and your book tour kinda sucked.

35:21.149 --> 35:22.717
Lou:
Language!

35:22.752 --> 35:24.586
But you're right,
it did kinda suck.

35:26.856 --> 35:32.193
And, you know, if I was you,
you'd tell me not to give up.

35:32.227 --> 35:34.962
When did you get to be
so grown up, huh?

35:34.997 --> 35:36.030
(Laughs)

35:37.499 --> 35:39.666
By the way, you did a great job
on your room.

35:42.371 --> 35:44.238
<i>(Drawer slams)</i>

35:44.306 --> 35:46.040
(Struggles with drawer)

35:47.675 --> 35:48.776
Okay!

35:48.843 --> 35:51.012
If you're okay with that,
so am I.

35:51.046 --> 35:52.146
<i>(Drawer slams)</i>

35:52.214 --> 35:54.247
At least I'll try to be.

35:56.484 --> 35:59.119
All right, you better crawl in.

36:02.590 --> 36:05.759
<i>Oh, and uh...</i>

36:05.827 --> 36:07.861
I love your room.

36:12.466 --> 36:15.168
Caleb:
So what's Amy gonna do?

36:15.236 --> 36:18.405
I don't know.
She's pretty down.

36:18.472 --> 36:21.174
Caleb: Yeah, being worried
about work and money sucks.

36:21.208 --> 36:23.276
Trust me, I've been there.

36:25.179 --> 36:26.612
(Sighs heavily)

36:26.647 --> 36:28.748
I probably shouldn't
bring this up right now, but...

36:28.816 --> 36:29.982
you know,
if we bought that horse,

36:30.016 --> 36:32.652
we'd stand a chance
at a five figure payday.

36:32.719 --> 36:34.787
Ty:
It's not a good time, man.

36:34.855 --> 36:36.322
Waitress:
That's $8.95.

36:36.389 --> 36:39.525
Oh no! No, no.
That's on the house.

36:39.593 --> 36:40.726
Waitress:
Okay.

36:40.761 --> 36:42.528
Tim: Yeah, Lou told
me about the clinic.

36:42.563 --> 36:43.996
I figure you and Amy
are gonna need every cent

36:44.064 --> 36:45.797
you can get your hands on.

36:47.467 --> 36:48.968
What?

36:49.936 --> 36:52.204
Oh, come on, you're not still
upset about the truck,

36:52.238 --> 36:53.405
are you?

36:53.473 --> 36:54.273
Ty: Keep the change.
Waitress: Thanks, Ty.

36:54.341 --> 36:55.607
Ty:
Thanks.

36:55.641 --> 36:57.642
Tim:
I'm gonna take that as a yes.

36:57.677 --> 37:02.814
<i>It was nothing personal, Ty!</i>
<i>It was a business transaction!</i>

37:04.684 --> 37:05.884
(Groans)

37:05.918 --> 37:07.686
He'll get over it.

37:07.720 --> 37:09.554
It might take him
a little while, though.

37:09.589 --> 37:11.556
I mean, he had to give up
a shift at the clinic

37:11.591 --> 37:13.525
and then you stuck him
with returning the parts,

37:13.559 --> 37:16.794
which he now has to eat
the shipping fees for.

37:33.712 --> 37:37.214

Caleb, it's Ty.

38:12.515 --> 38:14.750
I need to talk to you, man.
Gimme a call back.

38:17.854 --> 38:19.521
(Cell phone rings)

38:20.657 --> 38:22.558
Hello?

38:22.625 --> 38:23.625
Um...

38:23.660 --> 38:26.061
I'm sorry, my reaction to what?

38:26.128 --> 38:27.295
(Laughs)

38:27.363 --> 38:29.097
I-I don't know what post.

38:29.131 --> 38:31.866
Um, I'm gonna have
to call you back, okay?

38:31.900 --> 38:32.934
Okay, thanks.

38:33.001 --> 38:34.369
Georgie, can I borrow that?

38:34.437 --> 38:35.403
Yeah, sure.

38:35.471 --> 38:36.671
Grandpa:
What was that all about?

38:36.705 --> 38:39.140
Some local reporter wants
to do a story on me.

38:39.208 --> 38:40.442
Georgie:
Cool!

38:40.509 --> 38:42.143
He said he wants my reaction
to a post about me

38:42.178 --> 38:43.711
on Lou's blog.

38:43.779 --> 38:45.913
He said it's got lots of buzz
on Twitter.

38:45.948 --> 38:47.114
<i>Wow!</i>

38:47.148 --> 38:48.683
<i>Did you guys know</i>
<i>she was doing this?</i>

38:48.750 --> 38:51.852
No, but look at all the hits
it's getting!

38:51.920 --> 38:53.387
"My sister, Amy Fleming,

38:53.455 --> 38:55.823
has a special connection
with horses.

38:55.891 --> 38:57.725
And she has used
her natural ability

38:57.793 --> 39:00.661
to help more people and horses
than I can count.

39:00.729 --> 39:03.130
This week, she held
a horse clinic at Heartland.

39:03.198 --> 39:06.233
Problem is,
only three people showed up."

39:06.301 --> 39:07.634
"Now not that long ago,

never hold a horse clinic again.

39:27.588 --> 39:30.090
Your post on Amy's
got tons of hits!

39:30.157 --> 39:31.825
It's gone viral!

39:31.859 --> 39:33.860
Viral? Really?

39:33.894 --> 39:35.628
Lou, you didn't need
to do this.

39:35.695 --> 39:37.763
Yes, I did, actually,

39:37.797 --> 39:39.499
and it was the easiest thing
I've ever written

39:39.533 --> 39:41.567
because every word of it
is true.

39:41.635 --> 39:44.036
<i>(Cell phone chimes)</i>

39:44.104 --> 39:45.505
Huh!

39:45.539 --> 39:47.780
A new client wants to drop by
and meet me this afternoon.

39:47.841 --> 39:49.142
Jack:
Well, that is great news!

39:49.176 --> 39:50.676
Yeah.
He saw your post, Lou,

39:50.744 --> 39:52.611
and he wants to bring
his horse by.

39:52.646 --> 39:54.713
That's even better news!

39:54.748 --> 39:56.248
Wow!

39:56.282 --> 39:59.184
I guess I still got it.
(Laughs)

40:07.206 --> 40:08.385
Amy:
Huh.

40:08.752 --> 40:09.952
Lou:
What is it?

40:10.020 --> 40:12.387
I just got a text
from another client

40:12.455 --> 40:14.023
<i>who wants to bring</i>
<i>her horse over.</i>

40:14.057 --> 40:16.158
Jack: Well, it seems like things
are gettin' back on track for you.

40:16.192 --> 40:18.560
Yeah.
Lou, that is a lot of books.

40:18.594 --> 40:19.795
I know, it's crazy,

40:19.829 --> 40:21.229
but I just couldn't stand
the thought of them

40:21.264 --> 40:23.032
laying in a bargain bin.

40:23.412 --> 40:25.480
Well, why don't you just
sell them yourself?

40:25.514 --> 40:27.014
Yeah, that's a good idea.

40:27.048 --> 40:28.148
I don't know...

40:28.216 --> 40:30.250
Lots of people
read your post on Amy.

40:30.284 --> 40:32.019
That just proves that
they wanna hear her story.

40:32.053 --> 40:33.921
Amy: No, Lou, it proves
that people wanna hear

40:33.955 --> 40:35.856
what you have to say!

40:35.891 --> 40:37.224
Maybe.

40:37.258 --> 40:39.292
I guess I don't have anything
to lose.

40:39.327 --> 40:40.794
Well, I should go out.

40:40.829 --> 40:42.896
There's another client's horse
that I have to take a look at.

40:42.930 --> 40:44.431
What's his story?

40:44.465 --> 40:46.366
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>It got spooked by a cougar.</i>

40:46.401 --> 40:48.168
He's pretty skittish now,
so grandpa and I,

40:48.202 --> 40:49.036
we're going to take him out
in the woods

40:49.070 --> 40:50.137
and see how he does.

40:50.171 --> 40:51.405
You ready?

40:51.439 --> 40:52.906
Yup.

40:52.940 --> 40:54.107
<i>Lou:</i>
<i>Georgie,</i>

40:54.142 --> 40:56.943
there's something
I need you to do.

40:56.977 --> 40:59.111
<i>I need you...</i>

40:59.146 --> 41:01.648
to saddle up and go on that ride
with Amy and grandpa.

41:02.616 --> 41:04.551
Thank you!

41:04.585 --> 41:06.653
Lou: Have fun.
Georgie: Okay!

41:07.721 --> 41:09.689
You... come here!

41:09.723 --> 41:12.158
Let's read mommy's book.

(Chuckles)

41:26.039 --> 41:27.239
What do you want, Tim?

41:27.307 --> 41:29.841
Well, I saw the parts out there.
Still got 'em.

41:29.876 --> 41:31.143
Yeah. So?

41:31.211 --> 41:33.612
So, I was just...

41:33.646 --> 41:35.047
wondering...

41:35.081 --> 41:36.648
I know I was a little hard
on you the other day,

41:36.716 --> 41:38.516
and then...

41:38.551 --> 41:41.219
Well, truth is,
my guy can't get the parts,

41:41.287 --> 41:42.420
so...

41:42.455 --> 41:45.156
Oh. So that's what this
is about.

41:45.191 --> 41:46.792
Now you need my help.

41:46.859 --> 41:48.259
Yeah.

41:48.327 --> 41:51.229
But I know you've been
working hard lately.

41:51.297 --> 41:52.630
Huh!

41:52.664 --> 41:54.832
I have worked hard for
everything I've ever got, Tim.

41:54.900 --> 41:55.967
Yeah.

41:57.136 --> 41:59.170
So will you do the work?

42:00.939 --> 42:02.006
Yeah, I'll do it.

42:02.074 --> 42:03.608
Great! When?

42:03.642 --> 42:05.509
(Chuckles wryly)

42:08.113 --> 42:10.547
The price is gonna double,
you know that.

42:11.516 --> 42:12.650

42:12.684 --> 42:13.751

Sure.
