Ah!
- Oh, God.a piss my pants. - No.

00:07.000 --> 00:08.033
- As Shep and I took
a bumpy ride

00:08.033 --> 00:10.133
to shake my baby loose,

00:10.133 --> 00:13.367
Kathryn stumbled her way
through a rocky job interview.

00:14.767 --> 00:19.300
- You know, and--
um, I'm very um--

00:19.300 --> 00:20.700
- Hi, darling.

00:20.700 --> 00:22.166
- Meanwhile,
Pat agreed to turn

00:22.166 --> 00:23.700
Thomas's West Coast paramour

00:23.700 --> 00:25.700
into a proper Southern lady.

00:25.700 --> 00:28.266
- I'd be happy to go shopping.

00:28.266 --> 00:29.567
- And Naomie,
who had previously

00:29.567 --> 00:31.100
put her foot in her mouth...

00:31.100 --> 00:33.633
- You're a ----ing
thirsty bitch.

00:33.633 --> 00:35.433
- Finally decided
to make things right

00:35.433 --> 00:38.133
at the opening of
her parent's new restaurant.

00:38.133 --> 00:41.066
- I, without knowing you,
just cut you down.

00:41.066 --> 00:43.266
And I'm sorry.
- Appreciate that.

00:43.266 --> 00:45.734

had Thomas feeling frisky,

00:45.734 --> 00:47.200
with the wrong woman...

00:49.333 --> 00:51.300
- I need another.

00:51.300 --> 00:53.467
- Chelsea put Austen
to the ultimate test.

00:53.467 --> 00:55.400
- Shep said you're the one
that's like getting with

00:55.400 --> 00:58.066

00:58.066 --> 01:01.000

say something to him?

01:01.000 --> 01:04.266

he didn't realize the stakes

01:04.266 --> 01:06.433

07:21.500 --> 07:23.100
I still had feelings
for Chelsea.

07:23.100 --> 07:26.500

it wasn't fair to Victoria

something there with Chelsea."

07:45.000 --> 07:47.266
builds and it builds and then
it kind of

07:47.266 --> 07:49.233
plateaus off there at the end.

07:49.233 --> 07:50.767
So, I guess...

07:50.767 --> 07:52.500
she's just not interested.

07:52.500 --> 07:54.133
- I think Victoria is great;
like, she's hot and

07:54.133 --> 07:55.233

07:55.233 --> 07:56.633

07:56.633 --> 07:58.400
- But Chelsea--
like, she's in by 9:00.

07:58.400 --> 08:00.000
But Victoria's right there.
- Yeah.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.500
- She's dancing her ass off,
and then she's like,

and go be like

08:02.767 --> 08:04.533

Other girls, like, they like me.

08:09.400 --> 08:11.667
And I, like, I was with a girl

08:11.667 --> 08:13.100

08:17.166 --> 08:19.433

08:23.567 --> 08:25.266
we kind of just mesh together.

08:25.266 --> 08:28.033

man up and move on.

08:30.700 --> 08:32.100

08:32.100 --> 08:34.266

across the country

08:34.266 --> 08:35.700

08:35.700 --> 08:37.266

all your cat stuff

08:47.567 --> 08:49.300
off of all your personal
belongings?

08:49.300 --> 08:51.000
- It's not cat stuff.
It's cat nip.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.400
- Okay.

08:52.400 --> 08:54.266
- Can you help me out,
fold my sheet?

08:54.266 --> 08:57.033
- So, you're asking me like
I actually know how to do that?

08:58.533 --> 09:00.300

09:00.300 --> 09:02.333
Let's just be honest here.

09:02.333 --> 09:05.033
- It was a relief that
Craig wasn't at Nico because

09:05.033 --> 09:08.200
it's been this rage and repeat
pattern since the beginning.

09:08.200 --> 09:10.700
And it's nice to be able
to focus on myself

09:10.700 --> 09:13.066
and not focus on whether or not
we're gonna fight.

09:14.333 --> 09:16.333
- I'm not gonna
iron my sheets.

09:16.333 --> 09:17.734
Why would anyone wanna do that?
- I'm not talking the sheets.

09:17.734 --> 09:19.300
I'm talking about the towels
that are supposed to

09:19.300 --> 09:21.033
hang here nicely,
not look like paper towels.

but any drawbacks?

18:42.533 --> 18:44.233
- Uh, with Ashley it's

18:44.233 --> 18:46.133
the same drawbacks
you have with all women.

18:50.767 --> 18:53.133
- So, you seem like
an ennui has set in?

18:53.133 --> 18:56.367
- Yeah--no, not really.
I mean...

18:56.367 --> 18:59.266
For everything you get,
you have to give up something.

18:59.266 --> 19:01.533
- But, um,
she's stunning, you know.

19:01.533 --> 19:03.367
- Well, you know,
she's got inner beauty,

19:03.367 --> 19:04.734
too, you know?
- That's great.

19:04.734 --> 19:05.767
- That's what
I'm only looking for.

you know, the madness

19:08.533 --> 19:10.367

- She can.

19:10.367 --> 19:12.133
I mean, she was able
to handle Kathryn.

19:12.133 --> 19:13.734
- Oh, you're getting along
with Kathryn better

19:13.734 --> 19:15.266

- I think so.

19:15.266 --> 19:17.400
- Yeah.

19:17.400 --> 19:20.000
I think everything
got pressurized really quick.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.400
It's like my friend
would say, you know,

19:21.400 --> 19:23.233
"You known the girl

19:23.233 --> 19:24.767

pregnant for three months."

19:24.767 --> 19:27.700
So the pressure was on us,
like, from day one.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.233
Oh my God.
- See, I thought

19:29.233 --> 19:30.633
she had got on
this birth control

19:30.633 --> 19:32.533
and I was being careless, and...

19:32.533 --> 19:35.567
we were having sex
ten times a--a day.

19:37.166 --> 19:39.166
No man can keep up
with that appetite.

19:50.367 --> 19:53.033

It just kinda--is spontaneous.

19:53.033 --> 19:54.433
- But you'll, like,
drop off the kids

19:54.433 --> 19:57.166
and be like...

19:57.166 --> 20:02.233
I mean look, Kathryn's 5'11",
red hair, very pretty.

20:02.233 --> 20:04.300
She has this acerbic wit

20:04.300 --> 20:06.333
and can be fun to be around,

20:06.333 --> 20:09.400

Thomas is still drawn to that.

28:13.567 --> 28:15.166
And the pigs...

28:15.166 --> 28:16.767
these are male chauvinist pigs.

28:18.266 --> 28:21.166
Does this kimono
make my butt look big?

28:21.166 --> 28:23.433
- That's funny.

28:23.433 --> 28:26.200
- Makes everything look big.

28:31.700 --> 28:33.300
- Good evening.
- Hey, Michael.

28:33.300 --> 28:34.567
- You're looking well, sir.
- Thank you.

28:34.567 --> 28:36.066
- Good evening.
- Hi.

28:36.066 --> 28:37.467
- Hey, Thomas.
- You look beautiful.

28:37.467 --> 28:39.200
Ladies first.
- The two of you in suits.

28:39.200 --> 28:42.066
- You both look so handsome.

28:42.066 --> 28:43.333
Oh, good--
Four, four.

28:43.333 --> 28:44.734
- Oh.

28:44.734 --> 28:46.433
- All right.
- Jeez, my lucky night.

28:46.433 --> 28:49.734
- Here, let me fix your tie.
Jesus Christ.

28:49.734 --> 28:51.066
I was there when
you got that suit.

28:51.066 --> 28:52.200
- Good, it's Gucci.
I know.

28:52.200 --> 28:54.066
- It's not Gucci,
it's Tom Ford.

28:54.066 --> 28:56.467
- I know, the tie is Gucci.
- Oh, the tie is Gucci.

28:56.467 --> 28:58.166
- Yeah, I got Gucci
on the foot, too.

28:58.166 --> 29:02.300
- Two vanity-prone males
discussing their suits.

29:02.300 --> 29:03.567
Love it.

29:05.333 --> 29:07.467
- I'll have what you're having.

29:07.467 --> 29:09.200
- Hello.
- Good evening, sir.

29:09.200 --> 29:10.500
- There he is.
- Hello, hello.

29:10.500 --> 29:11.734
- Evening.
Don't you look sharp.

29:11.734 --> 29:13.100
- You're looking dapper.
- Yeah.

29:13.100 --> 29:14.734
- Thomas.
- Hi.

29:14.734 --> 29:16.233
- Patricia, good to see you.

29:16.233 --> 29:17.600
- Nice to see you.
You look great.

29:17.600 --> 29:19.100
- You do.
- Thank you very much.

29:19.100 --> 29:21.233
- Connie, Austen needs
a cocktail.

29:21.233 --> 29:23.233
- I can make you
a Moscow Mule.

29:23.233 --> 29:24.633
- Sure.
Yeah.

29:24.633 --> 29:26.233
Of course I'll take
a Moscow Mule, thank you.

29:26.233 --> 29:28.767
- Look at you!
Whoa, my oh my!

29:28.767 --> 29:31.500
Whoo, you never fail
to be perfect.

29:32.734 --> 29:34.233
- Oh...

29:34.233 --> 29:35.767
- I know all that BS.

29:37.100 --> 29:38.767
- Come on.

29:38.767 --> 29:40.500
- So, Thomas,
what's going on with you?

29:40.500 --> 29:42.500
- Well, Ashley and I...

29:42.500 --> 29:44.233
we had a little quarrel
last night.

29:44.233 --> 29:45.734
We went to this piano bar.

29:45.734 --> 29:47.500
I was enjoying myself
and she starts yawning.

29:47.500 --> 29:49.066
She wants to go home.
- Okay.

29:49.066 --> 29:51.000
- And I didn't want to go home.

29:51.000 --> 29:53.133
Then I was feeling
this pressure like,

29:53.133 --> 29:54.767
can I just have a good time?

29:54.767 --> 29:57.133
- I know you're trying to be
funny but it's not funny though.

29:57.133 --> 29:59.000
Not because it's offensive,
it's just not funny.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.767
- No, I'm serious.

30:01.767 --> 30:03.500
- Finally we get home,
and I said, "Look.

30:03.500 --> 30:05.400
"Do I need to send you
back to California?

30:05.400 --> 30:08.000
'Cause I'm not gonna
put up with this crap."

30:08.000 --> 30:10.133
- These are men that have
no idea how to date.

30:10.133 --> 30:13.133
It's called compromise.
Welcome to it.

30:13.133 --> 30:14.667
- She's always want--
"Eat this, eat that, eat--"

30:14.667 --> 30:16.767
I was like, "Look, I'm 55.

30:16.767 --> 30:19.500
Don't hover over me like mama."

30:19.500 --> 30:21.000
- Maybe she was
just looking out

30:21.000 --> 30:22.667
for your benefit,
your health.

30:22.667 --> 30:24.133
- Well, she...

30:24.133 --> 30:26.133
feels this need
to kind of control,

30:26.133 --> 30:28.667
and I don't really like
to be controlled.

30:28.667 --> 30:30.533
- You cannot restrain
Thomas Ravenel.

30:30.533 --> 30:32.166
- I know.

30:32.166 --> 30:33.700
You're like a tiger.
- I got all the power.

30:33.700 --> 30:35.300
I got all the money.
- You need to roam the jungle.

30:35.300 --> 30:37.166
You can't be in a--
you can't be in a cage.

30:37.166 --> 30:38.700
You know?
- Can't be in a cage.

30:38.700 --> 30:41.000
- Ladies and gents.
- You're missing all the fun.

30:41.000 --> 30:42.266
- Look, how handsome.
- Aww.

30:42.266 --> 30:44.166
Every now and then,
I can polish up.

30:44.166 --> 30:46.433
- You pulled it out.
- He pulled it out.

30:46.433 --> 30:48.000
Michael?

30:48.000 --> 30:49.300
- Shep needs a cocktail.

30:49.300 --> 30:50.567
- It's already
been ordered, madam.

30:52.300 --> 30:55.700
- He texted me an hour ago.

30:55.700 --> 30:57.300
- Hey, guys, guess who's
last to get here?

30:57.300 --> 30:59.700
- Yeah, as always.
Where is Craig?

30:59.700 --> 31:02.033
- He's probably
sewing you an excuse.

31:06.300 --> 31:07.700
- Hey, guys.

31:07.700 --> 31:09.433
- Hey.
- Wow.

31:09.433 --> 31:11.400
The prodigal son is here.
- Hey, guy--

31:11.400 --> 31:13.033
I know, we look like
The Oxford Club.

31:13.033 --> 31:14.200
How's it going, buddy?

31:14.200 --> 31:15.300
- Good, man.

31:15.300 --> 31:17.600
Good to see you, baby.

31:17.600 --> 31:19.200
- Well, Craig,
what's happening?

31:19.200 --> 31:20.600
You in good spirit?

31:20.600 --> 31:22.734
- Yeah.
Just, uh, living life.

31:22.734 --> 31:24.133
Sean wants to get a dog

31:24.133 --> 31:25.700
but we travel
too much for that.

31:25.700 --> 31:27.200
- Didn't you and Naomie
have a cat?

31:27.200 --> 31:29.033
Who got the cat
in the break up?

31:29.033 --> 31:30.467
- Naomie has the cat but--

31:30.467 --> 31:31.734
- It's a bummer.

31:31.734 --> 31:33.333
You know, I hung out
with Gizmo a lot.

31:33.333 --> 31:35.300
Come on.

31:35.300 --> 31:36.300
Ready?

31:36.300 --> 31:37.600
Hold on.

31:37.600 --> 31:39.567
It's gonna be bumpy.

31:39.567 --> 31:41.600
- You have--
you have visitation rights?

31:41.600 --> 31:44.333
- I was like, well, maybe we
should ask Thomas and Kathryn

31:44.333 --> 31:47.166
how--how we should structure
this custody deal.

31:48.667 --> 31:50.567
- Wait, is everyone single
in the room currently

31:50.567 --> 31:52.300
except for Patricia?
- Everybody's single.

31:52.300 --> 31:54.467
Except me.
- No, no. I have a girlfriend.

31:54.467 --> 31:56.767
- Thomas, I don't know if we'll
ever consider you not single.

31:56.767 --> 31:58.600
- I had a date last night.

31:58.600 --> 32:00.467
- With Victoria.

32:02.233 --> 32:04.367
- I moved on.

32:04.367 --> 32:05.767
When you're single...

32:05.767 --> 32:07.633
I mean, it gets to be empty,
a little bit.

32:07.633 --> 32:09.467
And then you're like,
"Good lord."

32:09.467 --> 32:10.734
- So, you're back
in the saddle?

32:10.734 --> 32:14.333
- Like, you know, it was, uh--
yes.

32:14.333 --> 32:15.367
- Dinner is served.

32:17.500 --> 32:18.767
- Oh, my word.

32:18.767 --> 32:20.200
- Oh, wow.
- Rotating Buddha.

32:20.200 --> 32:21.500
- Oh, it's awesome.
- Yeah.

32:21.500 --> 32:22.767
- JD, you're here.

32:22.767 --> 32:24.467
Mr. Ravenel,
you're right there.

32:24.467 --> 32:26.767
So, tonight is a vegan dinner.

32:28.367 --> 32:30.233
This is most beneficial

32:30.233 --> 32:32.367
for healthfulness
and mindfulness.

32:32.367 --> 32:34.633
- I had a protein shake
before this, so it's good.

32:36.200 --> 32:38.000
♪ ♪

32:38.000 --> 32:41.133
- Farrah is our
renowned chef tonight.

32:41.133 --> 32:42.500
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

32:42.500 --> 32:45.000
- So, you're having
local vegetable stir-fry

32:45.000 --> 32:47.400
and it has
a citrus-ginger glaze.

32:47.400 --> 32:49.367
And then you are
also having teriyaki tempeh.

32:49.367 --> 32:51.767
- Tempeh is a soy protein.

32:51.767 --> 32:54.133
So, it's fermented soy beans
that are pressed,

32:54.133 --> 32:56.000
and it absorbs flavor
really well.

32:56.000 --> 32:59.000
- I though tempeh was
a city in Arizona.

33:01.133 --> 33:02.400
I'm learning a lot tonight.

33:02.400 --> 33:04.266
- Looks wonderful.
Thank you so much.

33:04.266 --> 33:06.266
- Bon appétit.
- Bon appétit.

33:06.266 --> 33:08.133
- This is fantastic.

33:10.233 --> 33:11.533
- The noodles are awesome.

33:11.533 --> 33:13.100
- Guys, thank you so much
for coming.

33:13.100 --> 33:14.533
Mom, thank you.
- Thank you very much.

33:14.533 --> 33:16.266
- I keep thinking every year

33:16.266 --> 33:19.433
that you all will get over
your Peter Pan Syndrome

33:19.433 --> 33:22.300
but somehow it keeps on
in perpetuity.

33:23.700 --> 33:26.166
There was an article in
"The Wall Street Journal"

33:26.166 --> 33:30.700
that was titled, "Cheap Sex
and the End of Marriage."

33:30.700 --> 33:32.300
- Oh, God.

33:32.300 --> 33:34.400
- Women have

33:34.400 --> 33:37.300
ruined their possibilities
for getting married

33:37.300 --> 33:38.700
because they act like wives

33:38.700 --> 33:41.033
without any of
the commitment from men.

33:41.033 --> 33:42.300
- That and
they're doing better.

33:42.300 --> 33:44.300
The glass ceiling's
getting thinner.

33:44.300 --> 33:46.567
- You know, in the South,

33:46.567 --> 33:49.567
in my era,
if you were still single

33:49.567 --> 33:52.166
and you were
30-some years old

33:52.166 --> 33:53.433
you were a spinster.
- Spinster.

33:53.433 --> 33:55.367
They ship you off
to the spinster farm.

33:56.533 --> 33:58.166
- It's Thomas's house.

33:58.166 --> 33:59.533
- I thought it was in Brooklyn.

33:59.533 --> 34:01.033
- And send 'em all
to Thomas's house.

34:01.033 --> 34:02.467
- "The spinster farm."

34:02.467 --> 34:05.066
No, but women do have
a biological clock,

34:05.066 --> 34:08.066
and when they get to be 30,
to start getting worried

34:08.066 --> 34:09.467
if they want a family.

34:11.567 --> 34:14.066
- Why can't we just marry
as many women as we can afford?

34:14.066 --> 34:17.200
- Funny you should
mention that...

34:17.200 --> 34:19.333
At Thomas's suggestion,

34:19.333 --> 34:22.333
I took Ashley shopping
to Gwynn's.

34:22.333 --> 34:24.066
- Beautiful clothes you picked
out, thank you very much.

34:27.133 --> 34:28.433
- Are you putting him in
the poor house, Patricia?

34:28.433 --> 34:29.700
- Five fig--it was five figures.

34:31.200 --> 34:33.600
- I did not ask the price
of one thing

34:33.600 --> 34:35.333
because I knew you
wouldn't want me to

34:35.333 --> 34:37.333
because that would be tacky.

34:37.333 --> 34:38.600
And it was beautiful,
wasn't it?

34:38.600 --> 34:41.700
- Absolutely.
It was fabulous.

34:41.700 --> 34:43.100
- Oh, the fortune cookies.

34:43.100 --> 34:44.767
- Mmm, fortune cookies.
- Yes.

34:44.767 --> 34:47.233
- Take one, pass it along.

34:47.233 --> 34:48.500
- I have no fortune.

34:48.500 --> 34:51.233
Wait, here it is.

34:51.233 --> 34:53.233
"Your prescription for Adderall
is running low."

34:53.233 --> 34:54.500
This is for you.

34:56.500 --> 34:58.066
- Am I the only one with
a

34:59.767 --> 35:03.333
- "My life is a celebration
of my accomplishments."

35:07.500 --> 35:10.100
- All right, Thomas, your turn.
- Thomas, you're next.

35:10.100 --> 35:12.633
- "Every exit is...

35:12.633 --> 35:15.767
an entrance
to new experiences."

35:17.367 --> 35:20.467
- Why would that be
a new experience?

35:20.467 --> 35:21.734
Cheers.

35:21.734 --> 35:23.400
- If Thomas would have
done that,

35:23.400 --> 35:25.266
we'd have a lot less kids
in the family right now.

35:25.266 --> 35:27.000
- To my new vegan life.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.233
- Well, my brother-in-law,
he told me one time

35:29.233 --> 35:30.400
to get a vasectomy.

35:30.400 --> 35:32.000
- You should.

35:32.000 --> 35:34.100
- I gotta see where
it's going with Ashley.

35:34.100 --> 35:35.400
She wants a child.

35:35.400 --> 35:37.333
- Is she at least
on birth control?

35:37.333 --> 35:39.133
- No.

35:40.533 --> 35:44.233
- When I was
buying clothes with Ashley,

35:44.233 --> 35:45.467
she loved my ring.

35:45.467 --> 35:47.000
- Oh, my...

35:48.533 --> 35:51.266
- She said, "I'd love
to have a ring like that."

35:51.266 --> 35:53.000
- Wow.
- A ring like that,

35:53.000 --> 35:55.133
I think we'd have to get it
to the Smithsonian.

35:57.667 --> 35:59.533
- Well, I had told Kathryn,
I said...

35:59.533 --> 36:02.500
"You know, I think you should
spend at least four seasons

36:02.500 --> 36:04.133
with a woman," you know...

- Ashley.

36:08.166 --> 36:10.700

- You just said Kathryn.

36:10.700 --> 36:12.300
- You did say Kathryn.

36:12.300 --> 36:13.533
- You said Kathryn.

36:13.533 --> 36:14.700
- Little slip.

36:14.700 --> 36:16.433
- Freudian.
- Freudian slip.

36:19.033 --> 36:20.166
- Coming up...

36:20.166 --> 36:21.700
- I wish that we could just...
