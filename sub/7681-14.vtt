01:17.235 --> 01:21.822
There is a pretty simple reason why
fishermen get up at the crack of dawn:

01:21.823 --> 01:24.116
That's when the fish get up.

01:24.117 --> 01:26.243
But even when
I'm not going fishing,

01:26.244 --> 01:29.038
I like to drive across the city
that early in the morning,

01:29.039 --> 01:31.206
when there's no one else around.

01:31.207 --> 01:34.252
You can really feel the silence.

01:37.464 --> 01:39.964
Most of the time.

02:07.243 --> 02:08.618
Hi.

02:08.619 --> 02:11.830
How about 10 bucks' worth
on pump number three?

02:11.831 --> 02:14.249
PIease.

02:14.250 --> 02:15.834
Nice day, huh?

02:15.835 --> 02:18.335
What's so nice about it?

02:18.838 --> 02:21.338
Right.

03:11.557 --> 03:15.144
Yeah, nice day.

04:06.361 --> 04:08.654
EIaine's car is out front.
What's she doing here?

04:08.655 --> 04:11.824
- She's been here all night, man.
- Acting a Iittle bent too.

04:11.825 --> 04:15.605
Something's working on her
in a bad way.

04:26.631 --> 04:28.173
Honey,

04:28.174 --> 04:31.510
I went home and you were gone.
You had me worried.

04:31.511 --> 04:33.303
I had you worried?

04:33.304 --> 04:36.473
It's 6 a.m., Andrew.
You weren't here. You weren't home.

04:36.474 --> 04:40.254
Well, you know,
I'm a night person. I...

04:40.270 --> 04:42.604
Oh, I couldn't sleep,
so I went for a drive.

04:42.605 --> 04:45.855
Just Iike I usually do. That's all.

04:46.025 --> 04:48.695
How's the Iittle fella doing?

04:49.320 --> 04:53.824
I'd have to say it's true what I've heard
about an expectant mother's glow.

04:53.825 --> 04:57.215
You have never
Iooked more beautiful.

04:57.662 --> 05:00.289
Sweetheart, what's bothering you?

05:00.290 --> 05:02.958
I don't Iike to see my girl
feeling this way.

05:02.959 --> 05:05.335
I thought I knew you.

05:05.336 --> 05:08.463
I've spent all night trying
to understand, but I can't.

05:08.464 --> 05:11.633
I mean, I could have almost
accepted if you'd

05:11.634 --> 05:14.678
had an affair or something. I mean,
I know I'm not exactly a centrefold.

05:14.679 --> 05:16.054
EIaine.

05:16.055 --> 05:18.056
I thought we were a team.

05:18.057 --> 05:20.977
I thought you Ioved me.

05:21.144 --> 05:23.603
I know it's all my fault
for being so naive.

05:23.604 --> 05:25.689
Now, just calm down.

05:25.690 --> 05:27.607
- What's this all about?
- It's about

05:27.608 --> 05:29.401
this halfway house, Andrew.

05:29.402 --> 05:33.029
It's about the ex-cons Iiving here.
You know what it's about!

05:33.030 --> 05:35.530
You used me.

05:45.251 --> 05:49.671
Hey, you're not gonna believe this, but
somebody Ieft a beer bottle out there.

05:49.672 --> 05:51.423
You're blaming me?

05:51.424 --> 05:53.967
Oh, no, no, no. I just wanted
to buy an extra tire from you

05:53.968 --> 05:55.552
so I didn't have to use my spare.

05:55.553 --> 05:58.430
You think it's my fault because
the bottle's out there?

05:58.431 --> 06:00.515
No, no, really.
I just want to buy another--

06:00.516 --> 06:02.725
That's what's wrong
with the world today, man.

06:02.726 --> 06:05.770
Everybody's blaming
everybody for everything.

06:05.771 --> 06:09.440
Hey, you know something?
That spare will work just fine.

06:09.441 --> 06:13.528
I can remember your enthusiasm
about forming this house,

06:13.529 --> 06:17.407
about all the convicts
we could rehabilitate.

06:17.408 --> 06:19.450
What Iies.

06:19.451 --> 06:22.829
I don't know what you are
talking about. I really don't.

06:22.830 --> 06:24.914
Now, you're confused
and I wanna help you on this.

06:24.915 --> 06:28.042
I know about your deal with the
Soledad Brotherhood, Andrew.

06:28.043 --> 06:30.169
I found the documents.

06:30.170 --> 06:33.297
Forged documents
recommending early parole.

06:33.298 --> 06:37.260
AItered documents
falsifying required drug testing.

06:37.261 --> 06:41.848
My God. You've virtually created
your own private criminal army.

06:41.849 --> 06:44.100
- EIaine, I can expla--
- Oh, come on.

06:44.101 --> 06:46.811
Can you deny the illegal weapons,

06:46.812 --> 06:49.939
the drug sales, the robberies?
God knows what else.

06:49.940 --> 06:55.611
At Ieast have the courtesy to
cut the act. It's all right here.

06:55.612 --> 06:59.574
Okay, time to be honest.

06:59.741 --> 07:02.868
Now you know.
But you don't have to worry about it,

07:02.869 --> 07:06.080
because they can't force you
to testify against your husband.

07:06.081 --> 07:08.582
They won't have to force me.

07:08.583 --> 07:10.584
EIaine, EIaine.

07:10.585 --> 07:14.630
You're just as much a part of this as
I am. No, no, you married an ex-con.

07:14.631 --> 07:16.549
You got the grants,
you formed the house.

07:16.550 --> 07:18.717
Nobody is gonna believe
that you weren't in on this.

07:18.718 --> 07:20.678
- They'II believe it.
- Oh, yeah?

07:20.679 --> 07:24.139
And what will your rich
Beverly Hills friends say?

07:24.140 --> 07:28.050
- You'II Iook Iike a fool.
- I am a fool.

07:28.186 --> 07:30.686
Bye, Andrew.

07:35.193 --> 07:37.693
EIaine.

07:38.905 --> 07:41.240
I can't Iet you Ieave with those.

07:41.241 --> 07:43.450
You don't have anything
to say about it.

07:43.451 --> 07:45.119
It's over. AII of it.

07:45.120 --> 07:47.454
Yeah, I guess you're right.

07:47.455 --> 07:49.955
It is over.

07:50.834 --> 07:54.644
- You're insane.
- You give me no choice.

08:28.913 --> 08:30.330
EIaine.

08:30.331 --> 08:32.499
EIaine.

08:32.500 --> 08:35.001
EIaine!

08:39.631 --> 08:42.092
- What the hell happened?
- She's gonna blow the whistle.

08:42.092 --> 08:43.635
- What?
- She knows everything.

08:43.635 --> 08:45.262
She's even got proof.
We gotta stop her.

08:45.263 --> 08:48.223
Man, you can't go anywhere
right now. We'II get her.

08:48.224 --> 08:50.850
- Mitch, get down here.
- She understands the documents.

08:50.851 --> 08:53.687
- You have to get the documents.
- Take it easy. We will.

08:53.688 --> 08:55.939
Find something to patch him up.
We got some business.

08:55.940 --> 08:58.483
- I'm all right.
- What do you want us to do with her?

08:58.484 --> 09:00.485
- What do you think?
- What about your kid?

09:00.486 --> 09:03.738
Don't you understand? If she
gets away, we are all going down.

09:03.739 --> 09:06.239
Now, move. Move.

09:06.534 --> 09:09.034
Let's go.

09:14.625 --> 09:15.875
Where do you think she went?

09:15.876 --> 09:18.628
Relax. How far can a pregnant
woman get without a car?

09:18.629 --> 09:21.639
You two go on foot. We'II drive.

09:39.733 --> 09:41.317
Help!

09:41.318 --> 09:44.029
Help! Help me, please!

09:44.196 --> 09:46.823
- You about to have a baby?
- No.

09:46.824 --> 09:49.242
- There she is.
- No, I'm about to be murdered.

09:49.243 --> 09:51.743
Get in.

10:11.181 --> 10:13.015
Do you know who's following us?

10:13.016 --> 10:14.683
Friends of my husband.

10:14.684 --> 10:16.060
Any reason why?

10:16.061 --> 10:22.431
I'm having a girl and he wanted a son.
Could you step on it, please?

10:45.674 --> 10:46.882
What are you doing?

10:46.883 --> 10:50.743
I'm gonna charter a boat
for your friend.

11:06.778 --> 11:09.278
Come on.

11:14.410 --> 11:20.123
Something tells me I finally
met the right man at the right time.

11:20.124 --> 11:22.624
I wouldn't be so sure.

11:25.004 --> 11:29.414
- I'd say we're trapped.
- I'd say we're dead.

11:34.514 --> 11:36.264
Why aren't they following us?

11:36.265 --> 11:38.851
They will be soon enough.

11:39.810 --> 11:42.688
- Stuck.
- Get out the back.

11:44.232 --> 11:46.732
Better call Harryman.

11:46.734 --> 11:49.234
Okay.

11:51.489 --> 11:53.698
We can't go back
and we can't go forward.

11:53.699 --> 11:56.199
How do we get out?

11:59.538 --> 12:02.038
We don't. We get in.

12:14.595 --> 12:17.097
- Hello.
- It's Karl.

12:17.264 --> 12:20.475
We Iost them down by the old factory
at the wharf.

12:20.476 --> 12:23.394
- "Them"?
- She jumped into some guy's jeep.

12:23.395 --> 12:25.895
Find them!

12:26.023 --> 12:28.523
Let's go.

12:55.093 --> 12:59.639
- Now what?
- Try to find another way out of here.

12:59.640 --> 13:01.265
You make it sound so easy.

13:01.266 --> 13:03.769
No reason why it can't be.

13:03.936 --> 13:06.604
Let's see if we can find an open door
on the other side.

13:06.605 --> 13:07.938
Are you kidding?

13:07.939 --> 13:10.566
I mean, with my Iuck,
we'II be stuck in this place all day.

13:10.567 --> 13:14.717
Come on. Have a Iittle faith.
We'II make it.

13:16.990 --> 13:19.825
- You, okay?
- I'm having the time of my Iife.

13:19.826 --> 13:21.786
No, I meant the baby.

13:21.787 --> 13:25.080
I just felt a Iittle kick. We're okay.

13:25.081 --> 13:27.958
I suppose I could have tested this
ramp before I drove over it, huh?

13:27.959 --> 13:31.029
And they talk about women drivers.

13:31.213 --> 13:36.634
Sorry. It's just that I'm having
the worst day of my Iife.

13:36.635 --> 13:39.995
- And maybe the Iast day.
- Come on.

14:03.995 --> 14:06.495
There's gotta be an exit.

14:12.670 --> 14:14.922
Well, there's the jeep.

14:14.923 --> 14:17.841
They couldn't have gotten too far.

14:17.842 --> 14:20.010
Let's split up.

14:20.011 --> 14:23.347
We've been running all over the place
and I still don't know your name.

14:23.348 --> 14:24.973
EIaine Harryman.

14:24.974 --> 14:28.310
MacGyver. Does that have something
to do with why we're running?

14:28.311 --> 14:30.729
Believe me, you don't want
to get involved in this.

14:30.730 --> 14:32.898
I think I already am.

14:32.899 --> 14:36.860
My husband's an ex-convict. We met
two years ago in the penitentiary.

14:36.861 --> 14:38.528
- Oh, yeah?
- Soledad.

14:38.529 --> 14:42.032
He was a prisoner and I was a
social worker, and we fell in Iove.

14:42.033 --> 14:44.034
Or at Ieast I fell in Iove.

14:44.035 --> 14:45.869
What happened?

14:45.870 --> 14:48.872
I had this dream about
establishing a halfway house.

14:48.873 --> 14:51.374
He said he wanted to help
and I believed him.

14:51.375 --> 14:52.792
While he was in prison?

14:52.793 --> 14:55.837
No. I petitioned for his early release,

14:55.838 --> 14:57.589
drafted the grant requests,

14:57.590 --> 15:00.300
and within a year,
the program was a reality.

15:00.301 --> 15:02.135
Now I find out he used me,

15:02.136 --> 15:06.389
turned the halfway house
into a crime syndicate.

15:06.390 --> 15:09.225
And what's in that briefcase
is your proof, huh?

15:09.226 --> 15:10.810
Andrew made a deal

15:10.811 --> 15:13.354
with a prison gang,
the Soledad Brotherhood.

15:13.355 --> 15:16.265
He'd forged their early paroles.

15:16.484 --> 15:18.984
And made a fool out of me.

15:22.031 --> 15:24.531
Come on.

15:28.412 --> 15:31.247
I can't believe the way we came
in here is the only way out.

15:31.248 --> 15:33.748
What should we do?

15:40.257 --> 15:42.757
Let's go.

15:43.969 --> 15:46.095
What? What's the matter?

15:46.096 --> 15:51.017
I don't suppose you know
anything about delivering a baby.

15:51.018 --> 15:53.144
I didn't think so.

15:53.145 --> 15:57.023
I don't think right now is such
a good time for that to be happening.

15:57.024 --> 15:59.524
Tell that to this kid.

16:01.945 --> 16:04.445
Not now.

16:06.033 --> 16:08.683
The contractions just stopped.

16:08.827 --> 16:11.327
Well-behaved kid.

16:13.373 --> 16:15.873
Come on.

16:16.752 --> 16:19.252
Right there.

17:16.853 --> 17:19.353
Excuse me.

17:34.579 --> 17:37.079
Come on.

18:01.522 --> 18:03.690
Karl, please.

18:03.691 --> 18:06.277
I don't got a choice.

18:06.444 --> 18:08.236
Yes, you do.

18:08.237 --> 18:10.405
Remember the talks we had
when you first got out?

18:10.406 --> 18:12.615
- You had such big dreams.
- Hey.

18:12.616 --> 18:14.743
I ain't going back to Soledad.

18:14.744 --> 18:16.578
You have a chance
to turn your Iife around.

18:16.579 --> 18:19.247
Don't Iet my husband
take that away from you.

18:19.248 --> 18:21.868
Just hand over the briefcase.

18:27.590 --> 18:30.090
Sorry about that.

18:33.262 --> 18:36.222
AII right, I want you guys
to just sit tight.

18:36.223 --> 18:40.003
I'II give a call to your parole officers.

18:45.649 --> 18:47.108
What's the matter?

18:47.109 --> 18:49.444
My water just broke.

18:49.445 --> 18:51.738
Your wa-- ? Your water just broke?

18:51.739 --> 18:54.783
The stork's coming in a Learjet.

18:55.117 --> 18:57.034
You're not gonna
have it now, are you?

18:57.035 --> 19:00.247
It's gonna be okay. Relax.

19:00.664 --> 19:04.154
I really should get you to a hospital.

19:04.793 --> 19:06.294
I'm not going anywhere.

19:06.295 --> 19:10.215
At Ieast not until
these contractions stop.

19:10.299 --> 19:13.968
Besides, this is a fitting place
for Andrew's child to be born in.

19:13.969 --> 19:15.303
He's your child too.

19:15.304 --> 19:17.597
If you would've met me
a few weeks ago,

19:17.598 --> 19:20.433
you would've met
the happiest woman in the world.

19:20.434 --> 19:23.954
I wanted this baby
more than anything.

19:24.187 --> 19:27.357
Now I'm giving it up for adoption.

19:29.484 --> 19:31.235
Kicked me.

19:31.236 --> 19:34.966
Maybe he's trying
to tell you something.

19:37.451 --> 19:39.951
Come on, come on, answer.

19:45.125 --> 19:46.667
Damn it.

19:46.668 --> 19:49.461
- How many men we got upstairs?
- Half a dozen or so. Why?

19:49.462 --> 19:51.255
Because I haven't heard
from Eric and Karl.

19:51.256 --> 19:53.925
Get them ready just in case.

20:02.392 --> 20:05.352
- What are you doing?
- Exercises.

20:05.353 --> 20:08.814
I started with pushups, but they didn't
work, so I went right to breathing.

20:08.815 --> 20:10.232
Oh, funny.

20:10.233 --> 20:12.443
It was a Iittle joke, MacGyver.
Loosen up.

20:12.444 --> 20:15.362
That's easy for you to say.
I'm about to deliver a baby.

20:15.363 --> 20:17.990
I don't know,
you might be off the hook here.

20:17.991 --> 20:21.285
- Say that again?
- These Iabour pains come and go.

20:21.286 --> 20:25.656
My hormones feel Iike
the Ringling Bros. Circus.

20:27.458 --> 20:30.335
It's trying to fool me into
a false sense of security,

20:30.336 --> 20:32.504
just Iike its father did.

20:32.505 --> 20:35.048
A tiny criminal mind
already at work here.

20:35.049 --> 20:38.552
Maybe he just wants
some of your attention.

20:38.553 --> 20:40.846
He doesn't have
anybody else in this world.

20:40.847 --> 20:43.347
Yeah, well, neither do I.

20:44.517 --> 20:49.229
I have parents and everything.
I even have a brother.

20:49.230 --> 20:51.648
But I was always the black sheep,
you know?

20:51.649 --> 20:54.317
Not quite good-Iooking enough,

20:54.318 --> 20:56.528
always crusading
for the Iess fortunate

20:56.529 --> 20:59.489
when I should have been
dining with the Joneses.

20:59.490 --> 21:04.536
My Iife's the old cliché, them
giving me money instead of Iove.

21:04.537 --> 21:07.037
I'm all alone out there.

21:07.456 --> 21:09.956
He's all alone in there.

21:10.084 --> 21:14.754
Sounds Iike the two of you
got something in common.

21:14.755 --> 21:16.423
Where are you going?

21:16.424 --> 21:18.800
To get the two of you
some transportation out of here.

21:18.801 --> 21:22.131
Maybe we can help.
What do you say?

21:24.098 --> 21:26.598
AII right.

21:48.956 --> 21:50.790
Do you believe in fate, MacGyver?

21:50.791 --> 21:53.584
Well, I do. Whenever I do
anything good, it turns out bad.

21:53.585 --> 21:55.878
And whenever I do anything bad,
it turns out worse.

21:55.879 --> 21:58.464
I think we've been pretty Iucky
to come as far as we have.

21:58.465 --> 22:00.965
Things could be worse.

22:04.138 --> 22:06.556
You were saying?

22:06.557 --> 22:09.177
Just crank the wheel, please.

22:43.552 --> 22:45.302
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I will be

22:45.303 --> 22:47.680
as soon as I get the two of you
to the hospital.

22:47.681 --> 22:50.099
I can't wait to see how
you'II get us out of this pit.

22:50.100 --> 22:52.600
Me too.

23:27.220 --> 23:29.555
Do you really think
this is going to work?

23:29.556 --> 23:32.599
I think if you try hard enough
and make the best of a situation,

23:32.600 --> 23:36.380
the situation
won't get the best of you.

24:02.547 --> 24:05.757
Boy, I'd rather have you around
than Dr. Spock any day.

24:05.758 --> 24:08.051
Besides, it's decided to take a nap.

24:08.052 --> 24:09.719
I hope he takes a Iong one.

24:09.720 --> 24:11.638
You keep calling it a he.

24:11.639 --> 24:14.140
What makes you so sure
it's gonna be a boy?

24:14.141 --> 24:16.641
Just a hunch.

24:53.180 --> 24:55.680
Yeah.

25:19.581 --> 25:21.207
Do you recognize him?

25:21.208 --> 25:26.238
My husband. Makes a great
first impression, doesn't he?

25:48.777 --> 25:51.779
Something tells me
he's got a faster car than we do.

25:51.780 --> 25:54.370
Guess who bought it for him.

26:21.476 --> 26:26.106
- Are you sure about this?
- Yeah. We need a Iift.

26:45.750 --> 26:48.251
And you said everything
was gonna turn out fine.

26:48.252 --> 26:50.752
Well, I'm sure trying.

26:50.838 --> 26:53.928
I'm sorry. This isn't your fault.

26:54.675 --> 26:57.719
If it wasn't for me,
you could run right out of here.

26:57.720 --> 27:00.430
If it wasn't for this baby,
I could run right out of here.

27:00.431 --> 27:07.121
Listen, what do you say we stick
together and get all of us out of here?

27:19.742 --> 27:24.080
Help! In here. Get us out.

27:26.040 --> 27:28.540
Help!

27:36.675 --> 27:38.885
Won't he just come up
in the elevator?

27:38.886 --> 27:42.876
No, it won't work
when the doors are open.

27:43.974 --> 27:46.768
I think the only way we're gonna
get out of here is in this jeep.

27:46.769 --> 27:49.479
How do we do that?
FIy it out a window?

27:49.480 --> 27:51.980
If that's what it takes.

27:52.983 --> 27:57.853
Aren't we taking
this positive thinking a Iittle far?

28:02.534 --> 28:04.494
That guy with her isn't normal, man.

28:04.495 --> 28:07.873
Well, guess what. Neither are you.

28:19.176 --> 28:21.177
Any ideas?

28:21.178 --> 28:23.678
Yeah, maybe.

28:32.773 --> 28:34.857
Those straps Iook Iike they'II fit.

28:34.858 --> 28:38.569
- It's the weight I'm worried about.
- They'II support us.

28:38.570 --> 28:41.490
Positive thinking. I'm trying.

28:52.709 --> 28:54.168
Get on that phone and call Mitch.

28:54.169 --> 28:56.962
Have him get everybody down here
and surround this perimeter.

28:56.963 --> 28:59.173
Nobody gets out.
Do you understand?

28:59.174 --> 29:05.414
AII right, I'm going up. You stay here
in case they come back down.

30:17.043 --> 30:19.543
MacGyver!

30:35.478 --> 30:38.598
We're right back where we started.

30:38.814 --> 30:40.148
We're still trapped.

30:40.149 --> 30:43.485
- Only on the outside.
- We're not going back in there.

30:43.486 --> 30:45.986
Yeah, I think we are.

30:48.574 --> 30:51.074
They're in the alley.

31:21.482 --> 31:24.692
Boy, I sure will be glad
to get out of this place.

31:24.693 --> 31:26.861
We may have to
postpone that for a while.

31:26.862 --> 31:29.362
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

31:51.928 --> 31:54.430
- Where are we going?
- That door up there.

31:54.431 --> 31:56.056
We don't have time
to stop and open it.

31:56.057 --> 31:58.559
Who said anything about stopping?

31:58.560 --> 32:01.060
What are you, nuts?

32:09.070 --> 32:11.615
After them! After them!

32:32.051 --> 32:34.344
- Why are we stopping here?
- We'II never outrun them,

32:34.345 --> 32:40.165
but we might be able to buy some time
with a Iittle camouflage.

32:42.896 --> 32:45.396
Duck down.

32:48.443 --> 32:50.943
Better stay down.

32:55.366 --> 32:57.451
Are you ever wrong about anything?

32:57.452 --> 33:00.371
Never. Well, once. Maybe twice.

33:00.538 --> 33:02.956
Once is all it takes to ruin your Iife.

33:02.957 --> 33:05.333
You're sure?
You're absolutely positive?

33:05.334 --> 33:07.844
They didn't come past here.

33:08.546 --> 33:12.507
I can't believe the man in that car
is the man I married.

33:12.508 --> 33:16.553
He told me he Ioved me
more than anything in the world.

33:16.554 --> 33:19.389
He made me feel
Iike I was worth something.

33:19.390 --> 33:22.475
You don't need him
to feel Iike that, do you?

33:22.476 --> 33:26.855
Let's face it, MacGyver, I'm about
as boring and generic as they come.

33:26.856 --> 33:31.443
I would feel right at home
dressed in a plain brown wrapper.

33:31.444 --> 33:33.486
What?

33:33.487 --> 33:36.614
Oh, I, I just had this image
of you dressed

33:36.615 --> 33:39.451
in a grocery bag, that's all. I'm sorry.

33:39.452 --> 33:42.172
They'd have to double-bag me.

33:46.584 --> 33:51.104
You're way too good for that guy.
You know that.

33:51.380 --> 33:53.880
Believe it.

33:58.053 --> 34:03.141
You two backtrack through this place
on foot. You get back to the front gate.

34:03.142 --> 34:05.894
You two, stay here.

34:16.196 --> 34:19.489
This should keep them
from spotting you for a while.

34:19.491 --> 34:22.034
You just never give up, do you?

34:22.034 --> 34:24.328
No, ma'am, I don't.

34:24.329 --> 34:25.996
The whole place is surrounded.

34:25.998 --> 34:27.415
Yeah.

34:27.416 --> 34:29.542
But I've got a plan.

34:29.543 --> 34:32.043
We're gonna have to signal
somebody on the outside.

34:32.045 --> 34:33.420
How are you gonna do that?

34:33.422 --> 34:34.797
I haven't figured that out yet.

34:34.797 --> 34:36.257
Great.

34:36.257 --> 34:40.219
Maybe one of those old boats
have got a flare gun in it.

34:40.219 --> 34:43.472
MacGyver, just in case
we don't get to

34:43.473 --> 34:45.391
breathe in the smog tomorrow,
I'd just--

34:45.391 --> 34:47.059
Hey.

34:47.060 --> 34:49.728
There's no forecast
for smog tomorrow.

34:49.730 --> 34:53.429
We're both gonna be around
to enjoy it.

34:56.194 --> 34:58.694
We will?

35:00.323 --> 35:05.293
Yeah, we have to.
I haven't gotten to go fishing yet.

36:01.801 --> 36:04.301
Not bad, MacGyver.

36:06.472 --> 36:08.682
But we've got bigger fish to catch.

36:08.683 --> 36:11.977
Listen, you're gonna have to be
as quiet as you possibly can.

36:11.978 --> 36:14.478
I'II come back for you.

36:14.981 --> 36:17.481
I promise.

37:03.863 --> 37:05.697
Good thing about boats:

37:05.698 --> 37:08.992
Some of the stuff you find on them
work just as well on land

37:08.993 --> 37:11.493
as they do on sea.

37:14.081 --> 37:16.708
Finding a flare gun
would've been nice,

37:16.709 --> 37:19.989
but signal flags are almost as good.

37:20.379 --> 37:26.467
Each flag has a different pattern
which stands for a different letter.

37:26.468 --> 37:28.970
I could say a whole lot
with these flags,

37:28.971 --> 37:31.890
but just one word came to mind:

37:32.933 --> 37:35.433
"Help. "

37:41.191 --> 37:45.403
Now I just had to figure out a way
to get someone to see these flags.

37:45.404 --> 37:47.904
The right someone.

37:57.499 --> 37:59.542
Sailboats have sails.

37:59.543 --> 38:02.670
What I needed was
the bag they came in.

38:02.671 --> 38:05.965
It was just the ticket
to get my message across.

38:05.966 --> 38:08.466
Or rather, up.

38:11.930 --> 38:15.975
The next step was finding something
to get it high enough to be seen.

38:15.976 --> 38:18.769
And I wasn't about to be picky.

38:18.770 --> 38:23.149
Desperation tends to make one
sort of flexible.

38:29.781 --> 38:34.891
Industrial gases.
One of those tanks might do the trick.

39:17.453 --> 39:19.953
Yo!

39:36.055 --> 39:38.890
Of all the gases available to me,

39:38.891 --> 39:43.937
the only one that would lift
the sail bag was in this tank.

39:43.938 --> 39:46.438
Or this tank.

39:51.278 --> 39:53.738
I still had one problem, though,

39:53.739 --> 39:56.991
but that water
might help me solve it.

39:56.992 --> 40:00.203
Helium molecules
are the smallest of all gases.

40:00.204 --> 40:01.955
They'd slip through
the sail-bag weave

40:01.956 --> 40:04.874
Iike smoke
through a window screen.

40:04.875 --> 40:08.419
By soaking the bag,
the surface tension of the water

40:08.420 --> 40:11.990
could plug up the holes
in the fabric.

40:22.059 --> 40:25.354
One helium balloon coming up.

40:46.750 --> 40:49.503
Oh, hurry, MacGyver.

41:29.251 --> 41:31.669
I knew Harryman's boys
would see the balloon and the flags.

41:31.670 --> 41:33.671
I'd have to deal with that.

41:33.672 --> 41:36.465
But I hoped someone else
would see them too.

41:36.466 --> 41:40.596
Someone who could
figure out what they meant.

41:48.812 --> 41:51.312
What the...?

41:53.149 --> 41:55.649
You guys stay here.

43:46.220 --> 43:48.262
Look at the balloon and flag
on the factory.

43:48.263 --> 43:51.493
Must be some kids
monkeying around.

43:53.393 --> 43:55.893
Hand me the binoculars.

44:06.615 --> 44:08.908
No kids put that together.

44:08.909 --> 44:10.951
Call headquarters.
Have them roll some backup.

44:10.952 --> 44:13.079
Those signal flags say
somebody needs help.

44:13.080 --> 44:14.663
How do you know that?

44:14.664 --> 44:16.874
Four years in the Navy
is how I know that.

44:16.875 --> 44:18.876
- Call them.
- Five Adam 16.

44:18.877 --> 44:21.377
Five Adam 16, reporting.

44:26.885 --> 44:28.969
Sorry to have to do this.

44:28.970 --> 44:31.470
I really am.

44:31.640 --> 44:34.140
No, you're not.

44:34.809 --> 44:36.727
It took me too Iong to realize,

44:36.728 --> 44:40.397
but I know now you're incapable of
feeling sorry for anything you've done.

44:40.398 --> 44:43.609
BIeeding hearts, you're all the same.

44:43.610 --> 44:46.737
Did you really think I was capable
of falling for someone Iike you?

44:46.738 --> 44:51.498
Yes, I did. I guess because
I needed to believe it.

44:51.576 --> 44:54.076
But you know what?

44:54.162 --> 44:56.371
You're the Ioser. Not me.

44:56.372 --> 44:57.831
I know that now.

44:57.832 --> 45:01.902
So go ahead and do whatever
you have to do.

45:02.462 --> 45:04.546
Whatever you say.

45:04.547 --> 45:07.047
I wouldn't if I were you.

45:28.196 --> 45:31.186
- How you doing?
- I'm terrific.

45:33.117 --> 45:34.534
What? Now?

45:34.535 --> 45:37.035
Now.

46:00.353 --> 46:01.561
How is she?

46:01.562 --> 46:04.689
Both mother and daughter
are doing fine.

46:04.690 --> 46:06.816
Daughter? She had a girl?

46:06.817 --> 46:09.317
EIaine wants to see you.

46:23.000 --> 46:25.418
Hi.

46:25.419 --> 46:27.253
Hi.

46:27.254 --> 46:29.422
Well, you see?
She didn't exactly turn out to be

46:29.423 --> 46:32.383
the monster you thought she'd be.

46:32.384 --> 46:34.052
I know.

46:34.053 --> 46:36.553
That's what scares me.

46:39.224 --> 46:42.310
I suppose I could keep her
on a trial basis.

46:42.311 --> 46:44.951
You know, for a week or two?

46:45.773 --> 46:48.942
Yeah. A Iot of people do that.
