<i>Previously on Medium:</i>

00:01.747 --> 00:03.324
Allison, you don't look well.

00:03.325 --> 00:06.375
Maybe you and I should go
talk about this outside.

00:07.569 --> 00:11.418
They ran some tests while
you were unconscious. Um...

00:11.902 --> 00:14.113
I need to talk to you
about what they found.

00:14.114 --> 00:15.709
A brain tumor. I know.

00:17.278 --> 00:20.792
<i>- You're supposed to be in surgery right now.</i>
- Yeah, I know. I can't have that surgery.

00:20.793 --> 00:22.195
<i>What did you just say?</i>

00:22.196 --> 00:24.827
I can't have it.
At least not now.

00:25.344 --> 00:29.094
It's going to take away my dreams, Joe.
It's going to take away my gift.

00:29.095 --> 00:31.945
Your wife had a stroke
shortly before surgery.

00:32.204 --> 00:34.698
We went ahead
with the procedure anyway.

00:34.699 --> 00:37.661
But now she's showing
no signs of consciousness.

00:37.662 --> 00:41.457
It is impossible
to predict when or even...

00:41.577 --> 00:45.038
if she will ever come
out of her comatose state.

01:10.270 --> 01:12.421
It's time, Mr. Dubois.

01:12.919 --> 01:17.920
She's been unresponsive for months.
She can't even breathe on her own.

01:18.672 --> 01:22.915
It's not living, Mr. Dubois.
It's not life.

01:24.951 --> 01:28.566
I called the insurance people again.

01:29.501 --> 01:31.646
They're not going
to change their minds...

01:31.647 --> 01:34.674
- and the hospital...
- I know. I understand.

01:35.049 --> 01:37.270
Um... I have no choice.

01:37.796 --> 01:40.296
I can't afford
to keep her alive, so...

01:46.877 --> 01:47.955
Okay.

01:55.037 --> 01:58.377
Okay. Do what you...
You do what you need to do.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.027
Are you going to get that?

02:20.587 --> 02:23.300
- I could use a hand here.
- Yeah.

02:26.452 --> 02:27.588
Okay.

02:31.998 --> 02:33.669
Here you go.

02:37.520 --> 02:38.962
How did you sleep?

02:39.047 --> 02:41.358
Like a rock again. And you?

02:43.496 --> 02:44.627
Fine.

02:47.200 --> 02:50.208
So, what is that? 36 days now?
Without a dream?

02:50.293 --> 02:53.071
Not counting
my three months in a coma.

02:54.256 --> 02:55.829
It's gone, Joe.

02:56.900 --> 03:00.748
That surgery took it all away.
No dreams. No nothing. Just...

03:01.848 --> 03:03.181
sleep.

03:11.617 --> 03:21.617
:::   Timecodes  -  gius   :::

03:49.208 --> 03:50.823
- Bridgette!
- You hear that?

03:50.824 --> 03:53.245
Sounds like someone
just stepped on a cat.

03:53.246 --> 03:57.401
Listen to me, you child of Sasquatch.
The key to Mom's car is gone.

03:57.532 --> 04:00.714
Okay? It was in my purse, and now it's not
there, and since you're the only one...

04:00.715 --> 04:04.782
around here who goes into my purse,
tell me what you did with it.

04:05.262 --> 04:07.271
I have a spoon,
and I'm not afraid to use it.

04:07.272 --> 04:09.554
Okay, you know what? Look.

04:09.958 --> 04:12.509
You might not like going to school,
but Marie and I do.

04:12.510 --> 04:14.613
So give me the key.

04:14.735 --> 04:16.370
Mom! Dad!

04:17.718 --> 04:19.435
What's going on?

04:19.565 --> 04:20.760
Hey.

04:21.418 --> 04:26.281
I'm supposed to get everybody to school
and I can't find the key to your car.

04:26.630 --> 04:30.122
Well, don't look at me. I haven't driven
that car in four and a half months.

04:30.123 --> 04:31.733
Where did you put it?

04:31.826 --> 04:34.448
I always leave it in my purse,
and now it's not there.

04:34.449 --> 04:36.099
And I know who took it.

04:36.102 --> 04:40.102
She's always going through my purse
and stealing my money and my gum.

04:40.103 --> 04:42.680
Are you just going to let her
ruin my good name like that?

04:42.681 --> 04:45.493
All right, well, you're just going
to have to borrow Daddy's car.

04:45.494 --> 04:49.438
I'm sure that my key will show up.
It's got to turn up somewhere.

04:49.579 --> 04:51.373
Somebody mention my name?

04:51.467 --> 04:54.772
Can Ariel borrow you car
to get everyone to school?

04:54.988 --> 04:58.283
Well, wait a second. I'm speaking at that
conference in Scottsdale. I need my car.

04:58.284 --> 05:00.834
Well, can you drop
them off on your way?

05:01.364 --> 05:02.735
Yeah. Okay, I suppose.

05:02.736 --> 05:05.336
Can you pick them up
and bring them home?

05:05.386 --> 05:07.003
Yeah. Why not?

05:08.639 --> 05:10.423
I wish I was an only child.

05:10.424 --> 05:12.899
You know, I'm going to make it
my business to find that key.

05:12.900 --> 05:14.735
It's got to be
around here somewhere.

05:14.736 --> 05:17.873
Hey, why don't you make it
your business to rest? Huh?

05:17.874 --> 05:20.324
That should be your priority.
Resting.

05:20.481 --> 05:22.771
That and doing your exercises.

05:22.921 --> 05:26.888
You've been in a coma for three months.
Now you're finally back home for a month.

05:26.889 --> 05:29.144
And you're acting like
everything's back to normal.

05:29.145 --> 05:33.225
Well, everything is back to normal.
On the left side of my body anyway.

05:33.226 --> 05:35.415
Well, when you find that key...

05:35.685 --> 05:38.148
I expect a full apology
from you-know-who.

05:38.149 --> 05:40.522
Five minutes, we're leaving, Bridge.
Five minutes.

05:40.523 --> 05:41.789
Yeah.

05:43.356 --> 05:44.856
More hospital bills?

05:45.532 --> 05:49.064
Hospital. Therapy. More hospital.

05:49.825 --> 05:53.291
- I think I have to get a job.
- You had a job in San Diego.

05:53.292 --> 05:55.671
You gave it up
so you could take care of me.

05:55.672 --> 05:57.903
I think maybe it's time
to get another one.

05:57.904 --> 06:02.247
Hey, aren't you the guy who had that brilliant
idea for that solar cell thingamajiggy?

06:02.248 --> 06:04.970
Yeah. Majiggy is actually
my middle name.

06:05.064 --> 06:08.295
Ah. Well, see? There.
There you go. You have a job.

06:08.389 --> 06:10.651
Thinking up brilliant things.

06:11.637 --> 06:15.526
What? You don't think the world
needs more brilliant things?

06:18.169 --> 06:21.989
- I'm going to get the kids to school.
- You do that. I'm going to find that key.

06:21.990 --> 06:25.440
Hey, forget the key.
I'll find the key tomorrow.

06:42.193 --> 06:44.071
Here goes nothing.

07:29.763 --> 07:34.373
Allison, stop. Allison, stop.
Allison, stop.

07:40.968 --> 07:44.118
You know, I think to myself,
I want my hand to open.

07:45.998 --> 07:47.498
And it just doesn't.

07:48.293 --> 07:49.692
And I wait.

07:53.728 --> 07:56.028
It's like it has a mind of its own.

07:57.403 --> 07:59.309
But you managed to drive here.

07:59.310 --> 08:03.488
I steer with my left hand.
I drove with my left foot.

08:04.906 --> 08:08.907
Joe doesn't know. He doesn't...
He doesn't know I'm here, either.

08:10.346 --> 08:11.444
Okay.

08:13.292 --> 08:14.187
Sir.

08:14.966 --> 08:18.800
Before my surgery, I had a dream.

08:18.885 --> 08:22.085
It was one of the last dreams
that I ever had, and...

08:22.239 --> 08:23.973
you came to me.

08:24.452 --> 08:26.173
You offered me a job.

08:27.018 --> 08:31.500
Even though I was no longer dreaming,
even though I no longer had my gift.

08:31.819 --> 08:35.857
- Allison, you...
- Sir. Please.

08:36.403 --> 08:37.990
This illness...

08:39.066 --> 08:40.476
This tumor...

08:41.134 --> 08:43.491
It has cost my family a fortune.

08:43.904 --> 08:47.211
Joe had to stop doing
what he was doing in San Diego.

08:47.295 --> 08:51.866
And they gave him some money, but it wasn't
like he was in any position to bargain.

08:51.867 --> 08:55.934
And he's supposed to make some money
from the royalties from his invention...

08:55.935 --> 09:00.088
when they start selling it,
but that's- that's a couple years off.

09:01.665 --> 09:03.477
So I was wondering...

09:04.999 --> 09:09.796
if maybe I could answer phones
or I could... I could do filing.

09:09.797 --> 09:11.400
Allison, stop.

09:12.395 --> 09:15.907
Okay, if the phone is ringing and you
want to answer it, be my guest.

09:15.908 --> 09:20.050
If you see something lying around and you
want to file it, I promise not to complain.

09:20.051 --> 09:24.253
But even before I knew about your dreams,
you were hired to work here as a paralegal.

09:24.254 --> 09:26.404
And a damn fine one, as I recall.

09:26.553 --> 09:30.741
And I'm not about to hire
you back now as anything less.

09:31.818 --> 09:33.423
Is that a yes?

09:34.271 --> 09:37.620
It's going to take me a minute or two
to find the money, and it won't be full-time.

09:37.621 --> 09:39.956
I- I don't think
I could handle full-time.

09:39.957 --> 09:42.126
But yes, that's a yes.

09:44.726 --> 09:47.539
Thank you, sir.
You won't regret it.

09:47.661 --> 09:49.180
Welcome back.

09:49.820 --> 09:51.820
Our 11:00's in the conference.

09:52.441 --> 09:54.416
What do we have here?

09:56.131 --> 09:58.679
Come on.
If you're giving out hugs...

09:58.933 --> 10:01.032
I had no idea
you were out and about.

10:01.033 --> 10:03.181
- How you doing?
- Ah, you know.

10:03.182 --> 10:05.236
I have my good days.
I got my bad days.

10:05.237 --> 10:07.875
I got my good side.
I got my bad side.

10:08.195 --> 10:11.145
The good news is
my bad side's getting better...

10:11.195 --> 10:14.003
and my good days
mostly outweigh my bad.

10:14.332 --> 10:16.777
How is Lynn and little Lee?

10:17.143 --> 10:20.071
Both my ladies are doing great.
Thanks.

10:20.559 --> 10:23.868
Wait a second. Is Allison, uh,
here for the meeting?

10:24.084 --> 10:27.534
I don't know. That's, uh...
That's an interesting thought.

10:27.792 --> 10:29.928
You free? Would you care
to sit in on something?

10:29.929 --> 10:32.800
Hey, as long as it doesn't involve
physical therapy, I'm in.

10:32.801 --> 10:34.763
After you, Dr. House.

10:35.496 --> 10:37.880
<i>There's no bigger Suns supporter
than me.</i>

10:37.881 --> 10:40.450
<i>No bigger fan
in the Phoenix metro area.</i>

10:40.451 --> 10:43.975
<i>But I'd be lying if I said I was happy
about this latest round of trades.</i>

10:43.976 --> 10:46.721
<i>Fibbing if I told you that I thought
it was good for anyone...</i>

10:46.722 --> 10:49.582
<i>except some accountant
who's working in the Suns' back office.</i>

10:49.583 --> 10:53.023
<i>And good accounting rarely
makes for good basketball.</i>

10:53.286 --> 10:56.864
<i>I'm Sophie Cullen,
and I'm your girl in the locker room.</i>

11:15.252 --> 11:17.389
See what I'm talking about?
He's stalking her.

11:17.390 --> 11:20.290
He's stalking her with his camera.
Stalking us.

11:20.753 --> 11:22.771
These are public streets, Dan.

11:22.772 --> 11:26.397
And filming a newscast off your television
might be a little strange...

11:26.398 --> 11:29.341
- but I don't think it's illegal.
- Wait.

11:45.049 --> 11:46.814
You get the idea.

11:49.364 --> 11:51.709
How many of these DVDs
did Miss Cullen receive?

11:51.710 --> 11:54.568
Half dozen or so. But as you can see,
he's getting more brazen.

11:54.569 --> 11:57.400
I mean, he's no longer just
videotaping her in the streets.

11:57.401 --> 12:00.939
He's pursuing her in stores
and restaurants. He's peeping.

12:01.250 --> 12:04.556
I mean, both of us fear it's only a matter
of time before he shows up at her door.

12:04.557 --> 12:07.292
And I won't lie to you.
It's taking its toll on both of us.

12:07.293 --> 12:09.583
I'm sorry.
I'm confused about the relationship.

12:09.584 --> 12:11.851
Uh, you're the station manager?

12:12.195 --> 12:13.030
Owner.

12:13.031 --> 12:16.257
Dan-- Mr. Taper owns
several television stations.

12:16.351 --> 12:18.495
Yeah, a couple of newspapers, too.

12:18.496 --> 12:20.896
You know anyone
who wants to buy one?

12:20.991 --> 12:23.840
In answer to your question,
Miss Cohen is my employee.

12:23.841 --> 12:26.845
She's also my wife.
Has been for a little over a year.

12:26.846 --> 12:29.391
This fellow,
we know where he lives.

12:29.392 --> 12:32.663
We know who he is.
That's his name and address.

12:32.795 --> 12:35.653
I really feel we're dealing with
some form of mental illness here...

12:35.654 --> 12:39.157
and I just think it would be helpful
before something gets out of hand...

12:39.158 --> 12:42.130
before something horrible happens,
if someone from this office...

12:42.131 --> 12:45.500
somebody from the police department
could pay this fellow a visit...

12:45.501 --> 12:48.712
put him on notice, make it clear
to him he's being watched.

12:48.713 --> 12:53.163
I got a pretty full slate today,
but I'd be happy to pay him a visit tomorrow.

12:53.353 --> 12:56.030
You back on the clock?
Should I pick you up in the morning?

12:56.031 --> 12:59.399
Well, I don't know.
Am I back on the clock tomorrow?

13:03.929 --> 13:05.506
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:06.141 --> 13:08.541
Don't look now,
but Marie got pinned.

13:08.583 --> 13:10.333
- What's that?
- Pinned.

13:10.334 --> 13:12.942
Marie got pinned.
When they give you something...

13:12.943 --> 13:15.997
and they really want your parents
to see it, they pin it to you.

13:15.998 --> 13:17.983
Daddy, take it off.

13:18.403 --> 13:20.077
Career Day is tomorrow?

13:20.078 --> 13:23.473
Yup, we're "D"s.
"A" through "D" is tomorrow.

13:23.923 --> 13:26.696
Apparently, the other parents
found out last week.

13:26.697 --> 13:30.173
I'm guessing that somebody kept
forgetting to give us the flyer.

13:30.174 --> 13:31.333
Marie!

13:31.334 --> 13:34.310
Okay, so who's gonna go?
Which one of us is gonna do it?

13:34.311 --> 13:37.052
Interesting question,
given that neither of us have jobs.

13:37.053 --> 13:40.703
Well, actually, I need to talk to you
about that after dinner.

13:40.704 --> 13:42.605
I don't know
which infuriates me more:

13:42.606 --> 13:45.694
that you went ahead and did this without
even bothering to discuss it with me...

13:45.695 --> 13:48.797
or that you drove there
when half your body still doesn't work.

13:48.798 --> 13:51.429
Well, I didn't think it was important
to discuss it with you...

13:51.430 --> 13:54.788
because honestly, I thought it was very
unlikely that he would offer me anything.

13:54.789 --> 13:57.445
Why? He likes you. You worked there for years.
Why wouldn't he want you back?

13:57.446 --> 14:00.213
Okay, well, let's start with the fact
that I can no longer do that...

14:00.214 --> 14:03.611
clever little parlor trick
that he used to find so useful.

14:03.612 --> 14:06.588
And like you said,
half my body doesn't work.

14:06.589 --> 14:09.026
This is not how it's supposed to go.
You should be devoting your time...

14:09.027 --> 14:12.528
to getting better, building your health.
I should be the one that gets a job, not you.

14:12.529 --> 14:15.529
Honey, we have been through this.
You have a job.

14:15.867 --> 14:17.317
You're an inventor.

14:17.586 --> 14:20.586
You just need a little time
and a little freedom.

14:20.768 --> 14:24.802
And I want to do this for you.
I want to give this to you.

14:25.093 --> 14:27.018
Haven't you sacrificed
enough already?

14:27.019 --> 14:30.393
No. It's not a sacrifice
when it's about you.

14:31.410 --> 14:33.841
And I'm worried about your health.

14:33.842 --> 14:38.597
Honey, when I was at work,
I felt great, amazing.

14:38.598 --> 14:41.309
Almost, almost like I was normal.

14:41.703 --> 14:44.442
You know, it's only
gonna start off part-time.

14:44.443 --> 14:47.212
And for tomorrow at least,
Lee's gonna give me a ride.

14:47.213 --> 14:51.645
Tomorrow? Uh-huh. Well, I guess
we know who's going to Marie's class.

14:52.601 --> 14:55.990
Honey... watch this.

14:59.956 --> 15:01.266
Come on.

15:10.379 --> 15:11.973
Very impressive.

15:12.367 --> 15:15.458
Not only that,
when I was at work today...

15:15.561 --> 15:19.083
I felt this, this little flicker
in my head.

15:20.012 --> 15:23.288
- Well, I don't like the sound of that.
- No, no, no, it was good.

15:23.289 --> 15:26.831
It was like seeing
a teeny, tiny piece of the future.

15:27.207 --> 15:30.457
Like seeing a sliver of something
that's gonna happen.

15:30.590 --> 15:34.379
It was Devalos, and he kept saying
something to me over and over again.

15:34.473 --> 15:36.469
And then it stopped.

15:37.211 --> 15:39.614
And then he actually said it.

15:41.091 --> 15:42.138
Okay.

15:42.392 --> 15:46.005
Well, it felt like it was coming
from the same place in my dreams...

15:46.006 --> 15:49.290
and the things I used to be able
to do came from.

15:50.560 --> 15:54.044
Like maybe it's...

15:54.297 --> 15:56.086
maybe it's healing.

15:56.546 --> 15:58.525
Maybe it's coming back.

16:02.453 --> 16:04.867
Well, you don't look pleased.

16:09.443 --> 16:13.079
I guess I was just getting used
to the idea of this, this new you.

16:13.080 --> 16:15.604
You don't sound like
you like the old me very much.

16:15.605 --> 16:18.810
Come on. That's not fair. You didn't like
the old you very much either.

16:18.811 --> 16:22.544
That thing you're calling a gift?
It brought an awful lot of darkness with it...

16:22.545 --> 16:25.145
to you, to me,
to everyone in this house.

16:25.381 --> 16:27.303
Can you blame me for not missing it?

16:27.304 --> 16:31.803
Can you blame me for maybe hoping
that's the one part of you that doesn't heal?

16:44.186 --> 16:45.829
Very impressive.

16:48.595 --> 16:50.135
Anything else?

16:50.792 --> 16:54.092
Any other part of you
that hasn't wiggled in a while...

16:56.127 --> 16:58.362
that's suddenly come to life?

16:59.818 --> 17:00.759
Nope.

17:02.148 --> 17:04.916
Yeah, well, that's plenty
enough for me.

17:15.574 --> 17:16.723
Peter Winant?

17:18.267 --> 17:21.946
I'm Detective Lee Scanlon.
This is my colleague Allison Dubois.

17:21.948 --> 17:25.273
We were hoping you had
a few minutes to talk.

17:25.941 --> 17:28.141
About time you folks came around.

17:28.255 --> 17:30.736
Every day I have to paint
six or seven doors...

17:30.737 --> 17:33.287
and every night
those taggers come back.

17:34.005 --> 17:36.897
My phone starts ringing
every morning at 7:00 am...

17:36.898 --> 17:39.048
tenants calling with work orders.

17:39.286 --> 17:43.001
I can show you what they look like.
I don't have any names or anything...

17:43.002 --> 17:45.918
Actually, Mr. Winant,
the tagging and whatnot...

17:45.919 --> 17:47.719
that's not why we're here.

17:47.807 --> 17:50.657
We're here to talk to you
about Sophie Cullen.

17:54.231 --> 17:55.179
Sophie?

17:55.377 --> 17:57.127
You've been watching her...

17:57.270 --> 17:59.672
following her, recording her...

17:59.673 --> 18:02.023
making DVDs and sending them to her.

18:02.489 --> 18:05.320
She's very disturbed by it,
Mr. Winant.

18:06.956 --> 18:08.337
I doubt that.

18:10.926 --> 18:13.845
Did she come to you?
Did she complain?

18:13.929 --> 18:15.577
No. Her husband did.

18:21.419 --> 18:23.319
So I guess he finally knows.

18:23.394 --> 18:27.625
- Knows what?
- About us. About me and Sophie.

18:29.684 --> 18:31.383
About our love.

18:37.624 --> 18:40.174
I can't imagine
what he must be feeling.

18:40.647 --> 18:42.910
And what a way to find out.

18:43.747 --> 18:45.342
I wonder which ones he saw.

18:45.343 --> 18:47.793
I'm sorry.
I'm not sure I'm following.

18:48.313 --> 18:50.999
Are you trying to tell us
that Ms. Cullen knows you?

18:51.000 --> 18:52.327
Knows of you?

18:52.472 --> 18:55.580
I mean, you know,
as anything other than a fan?

18:55.768 --> 18:59.146
I'm trying to tell you
that we're lovers.

19:02.054 --> 19:04.383
Why do you look so shocked?

19:05.305 --> 19:08.086
Why does it strike you
as incongruous that...

19:08.087 --> 19:11.255
two people who look so different...

19:11.256 --> 19:15.205
who seem so different
would be drawn to one another?

19:15.206 --> 19:18.153
Why do you assume
we have nothing in common?

19:18.261 --> 19:21.097
You do understand, Mr. Winant,
that I'm gonna have to go back...

19:21.098 --> 19:24.648
to Ms. Cullen to corroborate
that her version of your, uh...

19:24.748 --> 19:26.513
friendship is the same as yours.

19:26.514 --> 19:28.740
And if it isn't,
I'm putting you on notice.

19:28.741 --> 19:31.065
We know who you are.
We know where you live.

19:31.066 --> 19:34.361
You so much as cross the street against
the light in pursuit of Ms. Cullen...

19:34.362 --> 19:35.912
you're going to jail.

19:36.991 --> 19:38.877
She worships me...

19:41.310 --> 19:42.955
and I her.

19:43.988 --> 19:46.807
The best thing about
being an inventor?

19:47.375 --> 19:50.428
Um, wow, that's a tough one.

19:50.541 --> 19:54.174
I guess it would have to be that you can,
you can do your job anywhere.

19:54.175 --> 19:58.260
I mean, you know, at home,
in your car, on a plane.

19:58.542 --> 20:01.259
As long as you remember
to bring your brain...

20:01.260 --> 20:03.821
the whole world is your office.

20:06.704 --> 20:08.864
Does anybody else have a...?

20:11.353 --> 20:14.048
Yeah, sure, go ahead.

20:14.608 --> 20:16.458
It sounds like a great job.

20:16.571 --> 20:18.571
Yeah, it is.
It's a great job.

20:18.768 --> 20:22.526
But what happens
if you never have another idea?

20:25.381 --> 20:26.641
Excuse me?

20:26.735 --> 20:30.746
Well, you said an inventor only
gets paid when he has an idea.

20:31.028 --> 20:34.723
So, what if you never have
another idea?

20:35.155 --> 20:36.753
Well, but I will.

20:37.175 --> 20:40.944
Okay.
But... what if you don't?

20:44.404 --> 20:45.897
But I will.

20:56.008 --> 20:58.721
- Hi. Let's go to bed.
- Uh, yeah, in a minute.

20:58.722 --> 21:02.472
I'm just, you know, trying to make
myself jump-start some ideas.

21:03.451 --> 21:06.118
Can you do that?
Can you make yourself have an idea?

21:06.119 --> 21:10.872
Uh, I don't know. But based on
the evidence at hand, I tend to think not.

21:11.807 --> 21:14.216
Okay.
Well, then let's go to bed.

21:14.329 --> 21:17.829
Why bother spinning your wheels?
Pick it up in the morning.

21:17.919 --> 21:22.298
I don't know. I guess I'm just worried
that I'm never going to have another idea.

21:22.299 --> 21:23.788
But you will.

21:24.107 --> 21:25.930
But what if I don't?

21:26.573 --> 21:29.615
Most people don't have
a single world-class idea...

21:29.616 --> 21:32.360
in their entire lives.
And I had one.

21:32.952 --> 21:34.838
Do you know how lucky
that makes me?

21:34.839 --> 21:38.139
You're driving yourself crazy.
You're driving me crazy.

21:38.140 --> 21:40.490
It's 10:00.
Let's go to bed.

22:13.478 --> 22:15.271
<i>911 how can I help you?</i>

22:15.375 --> 22:18.103
Please, please, please come.

22:18.587 --> 22:19.714
I'm hurt.

22:20.137 --> 22:21.844
<i>Ma'am I can hardly hear you.</i>

22:21.845 --> 22:23.474
He broke in.

22:24.472 --> 22:26.116
He raped me.

22:26.647 --> 22:29.154
He... he stabbed me.

22:29.831 --> 22:31.135
<i>What is your location?</i>

22:31.136 --> 22:34.232
And he- he killed my husband.

22:39.075 --> 22:41.002
What if I don't?

22:41.693 --> 22:44.744
Most people don't have
a single world-class idea...

22:44.745 --> 22:47.496
in their entire lives.
And I had one.

22:48.218 --> 22:50.950
Do you know how lucky
that makes me?

22:57.303 --> 22:58.777
Yeah, hello.

22:59.967 --> 23:03.434
Yeah, she's right here, Detective.
Something's happened.

23:03.519 --> 23:05.524
No, tell them I already
know what happened.

23:05.525 --> 23:08.354
Peter Winant broke
into Sophie Cullen's home.

23:08.457 --> 23:12.152
He killed her husband,
stabbed her and raped her.

23:12.624 --> 23:15.333
Wait a second. How can you know that?
You don't dream anymore.

23:15.334 --> 23:17.005
We haven't even been to bed yet.

23:17.006 --> 23:21.094
Well, I hate to disappoint you,
but that's all about to change.

23:22.345 --> 23:25.617
Well, it started after we left
the dining room. Then we went to bed.

23:25.618 --> 23:27.997
But we didn't go to bed.
We haven't gone to bed.

23:27.998 --> 23:29.846
Not yet.
Well, at least I haven't.

23:29.847 --> 23:33.182
I'm just trying to explain
what this experience was like...

23:33.183 --> 23:34.583
what it felt like.

23:34.716 --> 23:36.575
So, I had a dream.

23:36.576 --> 23:39.450
In it, I saw everything
that Scanlon just said happened.

23:39.451 --> 23:41.991
Then I woke up and I realized
none of it had happened--

23:41.992 --> 23:44.591
the sleeping, the dreaming.

23:44.769 --> 23:48.306
That I was still standing
in the dining room with you.

23:49.699 --> 23:51.896
Look... honey...

23:52.103 --> 23:55.727
I think this part of my body--
it's trying to heal.

23:55.728 --> 23:59.569
It's trying to figure out
how to work...

23:59.570 --> 24:01.728
just like the right side
of my body is.

24:01.729 --> 24:03.817
Okay.
But hold on a second.

24:03.929 --> 24:07.390
So, before you had the operation,
you had a dream.

24:07.942 --> 24:11.379
You dreamt that they'd operate on your brain
and then your gift would disappear.

24:11.380 --> 24:13.652
Now you're telling me
that that dream was wrong?

24:13.653 --> 24:16.364
That- that all the dreams you had
before the operation-- they were wrong?

24:16.365 --> 24:17.526
They were wrong.

24:17.527 --> 24:20.606
I didn't have the exact operation
that I dreamt about.

24:20.607 --> 24:22.531
I delayed that. Remember?

24:22.532 --> 24:25.526
That's why they couldn't cut out
the whole tumor out of my head.

24:25.527 --> 24:28.704
Maybe that's why.
It's been happening for a few days--

24:28.705 --> 24:30.844
this- this little flickering.

24:31.333 --> 24:33.945
- You didn't tell me.
- I tried to.

24:34.293 --> 24:36.143
You didn't react very well.

24:36.229 --> 24:38.011
Well, hold on a second.
When was this?

24:38.012 --> 24:39.624
It was never. It...

24:40.009 --> 24:42.809
it was going to happen.
I didn't allow it to.

24:42.810 --> 24:45.576
Just like I saw a dream
I know I'm going to have.

24:45.577 --> 24:47.414
I didn't want to have
this conversation.

24:47.415 --> 24:48.992
Okay, I see. So...

24:49.313 --> 24:52.672
you made this decision based not
on something that I did...

24:52.673 --> 24:55.632
but on something that you believe
that I was going to do...

24:55.633 --> 24:57.726
which, by the way,
I have not actually done yet.

24:57.727 --> 24:59.051
Yeah, that's about right.

24:59.052 --> 25:01.469
Okay, well, thanks for giving me
the benefit of the doubt.

25:01.470 --> 25:03.997
And, uh, do me a favor.
When you actually have this dream...

25:03.998 --> 25:06.699
that you already know you're gonna have,
don't bother waking me up.

25:06.700 --> 25:09.788
We both already know
that I'll react badly.

25:12.461 --> 25:15.569
I didn't see him at first
as much as I, um...

25:16.849 --> 25:18.098
felt him.

25:19.202 --> 25:22.028
His bigness, his breath.

25:24.222 --> 25:28.172
I mean, I was dead asleep,
and it was dark, and all of the sudden...

25:28.356 --> 25:31.534
I'm aware that there's
someone tearing at me.

25:31.727 --> 25:34.735
And I knew where I was.
I knew...

25:35.055 --> 25:36.435
I knew I was in my bedroom.

25:36.436 --> 25:40.586
And I also knew that my husband
wasn't there 'cause I couldn't feel him.

25:42.346 --> 25:44.145
I couldn't smell him.

25:44.324 --> 25:45.339
So...

25:46.295 --> 25:49.122
I- I started screaming for him.

25:49.944 --> 25:53.698
I mean, while there's this other person
pulling at me and...

25:53.858 --> 25:56.069
and grunting at me.

25:56.749 --> 25:59.930
His hand was over my mouth,
and I just remember...

26:00.439 --> 26:02.209
shutting my eyes.

26:04.773 --> 26:07.158
I thought he was gonna break me.

26:10.911 --> 26:13.399
And somewhere in there...

26:14.382 --> 26:16.204
I guess I blacked out.

26:16.859 --> 26:17.789
And...

26:19.291 --> 26:21.535
when I came to, he was gone.

26:23.274 --> 26:27.274
My stomach-- the left side
was throbbing.

26:28.813 --> 26:32.313
That's when I saw the blood
and realized he had stabbed me.

26:33.160 --> 26:34.852
I tried to get up...

26:35.998 --> 26:38.939
but I couldn't,
so I- I dragged myself...

26:39.061 --> 26:43.137
across the floor, out of the bedroom
and went looking for Dan.

26:49.223 --> 26:51.289
I found him in the kitchen.

26:53.849 --> 26:56.649
But at some point,
you did get a look at him?

26:56.661 --> 26:57.710
Yeah.

26:58.881 --> 27:02.440
I was able to turn around
for just a moment.

27:05.959 --> 27:07.941
He looked like a rhino.

27:08.668 --> 27:11.467
Like an angry rhino.

27:13.044 --> 27:15.806
He can't be that hard to find,
a creature like that.

27:15.807 --> 27:19.101
He can't.
He can't be that hard to find.

27:19.214 --> 27:20.686
We'll find him.

27:21.771 --> 27:23.171
But until we do...

27:23.810 --> 27:27.848
you'll have two police outside your door
24 hours a day, seven days a week.

27:27.849 --> 27:30.753
Everything she just told us
in there, I saw it, Lee.

27:30.754 --> 27:34.052
I saw it the other day when
we were visiting that monster.

27:34.053 --> 27:36.896
- What are you talking about?
- I saw them making love.

27:36.897 --> 27:39.028
At least I thought that's what I saw.

27:39.029 --> 27:42.298
I- I thought I was seeing some
kind of fantasy in his head...

27:42.299 --> 27:44.492
but I guess I was just
seeing him rape her.

27:44.493 --> 27:46.849
And I could've stopped it, Lee.
We could've stopped it.

27:46.850 --> 27:48.332
Wait a second.

27:48.708 --> 27:51.162
First of all, you weren't even sure
you were psychic yesterday.

27:51.163 --> 27:53.077
Second of all,
how could you have stopped it?

27:53.078 --> 27:55.617
You can't lock someone up
for something he hasn't done yet.

27:55.618 --> 27:58.423
Especially someone with an absolutely
clean record like that guy has.

27:58.424 --> 27:59.935
I don't care.

28:08.435 --> 28:10.873
- Hi. Joe Dubois, right?
- Yeah.

28:10.874 --> 28:14.463
I'm Drew Campbell. We met
at the kindergarten play last year...

28:14.464 --> 28:16.222
the four food group thing.

28:16.223 --> 28:17.755
Oh, right. Okay.

28:17.756 --> 28:21.556
Yeah, my boy got a real kick out
of your career day presentation.

28:21.723 --> 28:26.006
He came home, told me all about it.
All about that solar cell you built.

28:26.007 --> 28:27.318
He did?

28:27.853 --> 28:30.047
I'm a corporate recruiter.

28:30.637 --> 28:34.937
A headhunter. I work with all the major
engineering firms in the Southwest.

28:36.221 --> 28:38.159
I could sell the hell out of you.

28:38.160 --> 28:40.953
That's not what I read in the papers.
What I read in the papers is that...

28:40.954 --> 28:42.868
when it comes to jobs,
no one's hiring.

28:42.869 --> 28:46.896
I'm just saying that companies
focusing on green technology...

28:46.897 --> 28:50.121
are pretty flush with
stimulus money right now.

28:50.511 --> 28:52.915
- All of them are hiring.
- Okay, if you say so.

28:52.916 --> 28:55.075
But my background
is in- in aeronautics.

28:55.076 --> 28:57.857
I don't know anything
about doing engineering.

28:57.858 --> 29:00.505
Joe, you built a solar cell.

29:00.921 --> 29:03.579
It doesn't get
much greener than that.

29:04.527 --> 29:07.616
Hey, limo?
Somebody call for a limo?

29:09.641 --> 29:12.855
Now, that is what I call service.

29:14.139 --> 29:16.335
Do you think the restrooms
are still open in there?

29:16.336 --> 29:17.636
Guess so.

29:18.610 --> 29:19.927
Two minutes.

29:20.349 --> 29:23.109
Well, that is not
what I call service.

29:31.349 --> 29:33.817
She made a fool out of me.

29:35.034 --> 29:38.442
Even now, she's laughing at me.

29:45.408 --> 29:48.149
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.
Joe said I could find you here.

29:48.150 --> 29:50.400
- What's going on?
- Peter Winant.

29:50.844 --> 29:54.730
About a half hour ago, he tried to force
his way into Sophie Cullen's hospital room.

29:54.731 --> 29:58.688
One of the officers we had stationed there
ordered him to freeze; Winant went after him.

29:58.689 --> 30:02.370
The other officer put one
in his neck, two in his back.

30:06.046 --> 30:08.046
Hey, penny for your thoughts.

30:08.938 --> 30:11.788
I'm not sure you would get
your money's worth.

30:11.905 --> 30:14.789
Just thinking about
how random life is.

30:15.923 --> 30:20.215
One day there's this couple, you know,
happy, they're living their life.

30:20.216 --> 30:22.865
And this other guy comes along...

30:23.603 --> 30:26.003
kills the husband, tortures the wife.

30:26.096 --> 30:27.198
Random.

30:27.654 --> 30:29.376
Now he's dead, too.

30:31.152 --> 30:32.732
Completely random.

30:32.910 --> 30:36.660
Yeah. Hey, speaking of random,
this guy came up to me in school.

30:36.821 --> 30:40.518
Uh, his kid told him about
my presentation on career day.

30:40.519 --> 30:43.369
Turns out, he thinks
he may have a job for me.

30:43.665 --> 30:46.279
W- What are you talking about?
We've been through this.

30:46.280 --> 30:47.866
There are no jobs.

30:48.092 --> 30:52.409
Not in aeronautics, not in Phoenix.
Besides, you're not looking for a job.

30:52.410 --> 30:54.356
I don't know.
I might be.

30:55.776 --> 30:58.527
You know, I miss
seeing people every day.

30:58.528 --> 31:01.296
I mean, people other than my kids
in the rearview mirror...

31:01.297 --> 31:03.147
when I take them to school.

31:03.456 --> 31:07.249
I miss drinking coffee that
I didn't have to make myself.

31:07.540 --> 31:10.834
I- I can't believe I'm saying this,
but I miss commuting a little, you know?

31:10.835 --> 31:14.091
I miss being by myself
and listening to the radio.

31:14.504 --> 31:15.997
I do. I miss it.

31:16.371 --> 31:18.895
I miss working for someone.
I miss having a job.

31:18.896 --> 31:21.950
Okay, well, maybe you should call
this magic man, this man...

31:21.951 --> 31:25.249
who knows about all these magic jobs
that no one else knows about.

31:25.250 --> 31:26.907
They're green jobs.

31:27.029 --> 31:30.654
Turns out I'm green engineer,
and I didn't even know it.

31:31.249 --> 31:34.147
I don't care
what color engineer you are...

31:34.347 --> 31:36.830
as long as you're a happy engineer.

31:56.794 --> 32:00.606
Hey. That's not all for you,
you know.

32:29.714 --> 32:31.451
I don't want to leave.

32:32.071 --> 32:35.021
- Why do I have to leave?
- Because I'm married.

32:35.089 --> 32:38.471
And my husband's gonna be
home soon and because...

32:39.467 --> 32:41.465
you know the answer.

32:43.472 --> 32:45.050
What if I just stay?

32:45.303 --> 32:49.695
What if I just don't leave
and we wait for him to get home?

32:50.182 --> 32:51.712
And then he knows.

32:51.843 --> 32:55.164
And then nothing will matter
and then we can get on with it.

32:55.165 --> 32:58.191
It's not that easy, Peter.
I've explained this to you.

32:58.192 --> 33:00.031
I need a job.

33:01.245 --> 33:03.385
You're gonna have to
give me time to find work...

33:03.386 --> 33:06.111
at another station
before we can tell anyone.

33:06.112 --> 33:07.135
Okay?

33:08.412 --> 33:11.867
It's hard to wait. I...

33:14.233 --> 33:17.407
I want to spend
a whole night with you.

33:18.551 --> 33:20.655
I want to wake up with you.

33:22.820 --> 33:24.304
I want that too.

33:25.347 --> 33:27.009
Soon, my love.

33:27.988 --> 33:29.650
I promise.

34:47.887 --> 34:50.815
You sit tight.
I'll be right back.

35:23.563 --> 35:25.771
You're going home today?

35:26.579 --> 35:29.181
Yeah, they're letting me leave
in a couple hours.

35:29.182 --> 35:32.047
The nurses showed me how to dress
my wounds last night.

35:32.048 --> 35:33.602
That's amazing.

35:34.026 --> 35:36.805
Two stab wounds
and no lasting damage.

35:36.899 --> 35:40.087
Well, I don't know.
You haven't seen the two scars...

35:40.088 --> 35:42.244
I'm going to be left with
for the rest of my life.

35:42.245 --> 35:43.470
But still.

35:43.602 --> 35:46.821
I mean, no major organs struck.

35:46.822 --> 35:49.997
No nerves severed.
It's almost as if whoever did this...

35:49.998 --> 35:53.443
was determined to do
as little damage as possible.

35:54.100 --> 35:57.410
Excuse me? "Whoever did this?"
Peter Winant did this.

35:57.411 --> 36:00.062
He killed my husband
and he tried to kill me.

36:00.063 --> 36:01.514
If you say so.

36:01.767 --> 36:04.117
Well, wait a minute.
Who doesn't say so?

36:04.118 --> 36:07.878
I don't know. I just know that Peter thinks
you made a fool out of him.

36:07.879 --> 36:09.722
Peter thinks that...

36:14.944 --> 36:18.542
You're that Mrs. Dubois.
I hadn't put it together.

36:18.993 --> 36:22.184
Well, little does he know
he's just the tip of the iceberg.

36:22.185 --> 36:24.903
Yes, you made a fool out of Peter.
You made a fool out of your husband.

36:24.904 --> 36:27.448
You're making a fool
out of the whole justice system.

36:27.449 --> 36:29.493
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

36:29.494 --> 36:32.319
He must have been thrilled
the day you answered him.

36:32.320 --> 36:34.438
The day you reached out.
How did it start?

36:34.439 --> 36:37.589
Did he send you a mash-up
of yourself on television?

36:37.678 --> 36:40.724
And what, what did his face look like
when you agreed to meet with him?

36:40.725 --> 36:43.755
Now that, that's a DVD
I'd like to see.

36:44.533 --> 36:46.392
How about when you slept with him?

36:46.393 --> 36:48.833
Or when you told him
that you loved him?

36:48.834 --> 36:50.836
What, no- no recording of that?

36:51.043 --> 36:52.949
What seems to be the problem,
Ms. Cullen?

36:52.950 --> 36:54.690
Could you send somebody by, please?

36:54.691 --> 36:57.251
How about when you stabbed yourself?

36:57.535 --> 37:00.889
Could you please not block the door?
There's a nurse that's coming here any minute.

37:00.890 --> 37:03.687
What about when you stabbed
your husband to death?

37:03.688 --> 37:05.488
No footage of that either?

37:05.820 --> 37:09.923
It's funny. I don't see that police detective
you came here with the other day.

37:09.924 --> 37:12.392
Could it be that this visit
isn't official business?

37:12.393 --> 37:16.234
That what you're doing right now
amounts to nothing more than harassment?

37:16.235 --> 37:18.467
Isn't this the moment
that you're gonna remind me...

37:18.468 --> 37:21.505
what a wealthy woman you are now
and how many television stations...

37:21.506 --> 37:25.682
and newspapers you own
and how you employ tens of attorneys...

37:25.683 --> 37:29.779
all of whom you're going to sic on me
if I don't leave this very minute?

37:29.780 --> 37:32.397
Well, don't worry.
I'm leaving.

37:33.444 --> 37:35.697
But you'll be seeing me.

37:49.362 --> 37:51.812
- Tell me you're done.
- I'm not done.

37:52.090 --> 37:55.082
You're not done, meaning, uh,
I have more to look at?

37:55.083 --> 37:57.735
Or you're not done 'cause you
haven't found what you want to find...

37:57.736 --> 38:00.036
even though you've already
looked at everything ten times?

38:00.037 --> 38:01.387
I'm not done yet.

38:01.529 --> 38:04.460
Come on, Allison. We've already
been here for three hours.

38:04.461 --> 38:07.612
This joint's the size of a shoe box.
If you don't see it, it isn't here.

38:07.613 --> 38:10.463
It's got to be.
I just know it. I can feel it.

38:10.464 --> 38:13.099
They were involved.
I can smell it.

38:13.596 --> 38:16.657
Come to your senses.
There's no way that guy...

38:16.835 --> 38:20.276
and that girl were...
what was the word you used?

38:20.394 --> 38:22.496
- Involved.
- Involved.

38:23.580 --> 38:26.190
Anywhere other than in his head.

38:27.155 --> 38:29.705
You find a souvenir pair
of her panties?

38:29.803 --> 38:32.858
Under the mattress?
Hidden in the closet?

38:33.071 --> 38:36.607
Come on, you know that's what
you're gonna need to make the case.

38:36.608 --> 38:38.367
How about a love letter?

38:38.461 --> 38:42.103
You don't even have a photograph with the two
of them in it 'cause they weren't together.

38:42.104 --> 38:43.622
I told you I'm not done yet.

38:43.623 --> 38:47.286
Well, I'm done and I'm your ride.
Come on.

38:58.365 --> 38:59.980
Look at that door.

39:00.365 --> 39:02.525
Not only are we not
going to clear his name...

39:02.526 --> 39:04.808
we didn't even try to find
the little turds...

39:04.809 --> 39:07.643
who were making his life
miserable by doing this.

39:07.644 --> 39:10.256
It's kind of a moot point
at this juncture, Allison.

39:10.257 --> 39:12.657
Lee, let's go back inside,
look at the security tape...

39:12.658 --> 39:14.358
and see if we can ID them.

39:14.359 --> 39:17.652
- What are you talking about?
- The taggers-- they're on the tape.

39:17.653 --> 39:21.126
Anyone around this apartment
would be on that tape.

39:23.208 --> 39:25.020
Oh, my God, Lee...

39:35.650 --> 39:38.598
Ah, Miss Cullen,
thank you for joining us.

39:38.599 --> 39:42.149
You're just in time.
We were about to watch some television.

39:42.947 --> 39:44.536
Should I have brought a lawyer?

39:44.537 --> 39:48.428
If you're asking me if you're about to be
charged with anything, absolutely not.

39:48.429 --> 39:52.100
We simply want to give you a progress report
on the investigation into your husband's death.

39:52.101 --> 39:55.191
- Please.
- But we know who killed my husband.

39:55.633 --> 39:58.261
It was the same man
who attacked me, raped me.

39:58.262 --> 40:01.181
And he's dead, so there's
nothing to investigate.

40:01.182 --> 40:03.382
Are you referring to your stalker?

40:03.383 --> 40:07.384
The man you told us you never saw
until the night he broke into your home?

40:07.385 --> 40:08.351
That's right.

40:08.352 --> 40:11.300
Well, what if we were to tell you
we had surveillance footage of you...

40:11.301 --> 40:14.600
making your way into and out of Peter's
apartment on two different evenings...

40:14.601 --> 40:16.401
after your late newscast?

40:16.649 --> 40:19.794
- Surveillance footage?
- There was a problem with vandals.

40:19.795 --> 40:23.296
Peter was determined to catch them.
He set up security cameras.

40:23.297 --> 40:25.352
He had a monitor
right there in his apartment.

40:25.353 --> 40:27.406
I'm guessing
he must have shut it off...

40:27.407 --> 40:30.154
when he was entertaining you
or else you would've seen it.

40:30.155 --> 40:31.679
Even though it was night...

40:31.680 --> 40:34.111
even though you were wearing
sunglasses, I'm quite sure...

40:34.112 --> 40:37.520
that a jury will have
no problem believing it's you.

40:42.623 --> 40:44.566
And what will that prove?

40:44.567 --> 40:47.008
It'll prove you're a liar,
for one thing.

40:47.009 --> 40:48.991
A liar... perhaps...

40:49.798 --> 40:51.039
but not a killer.

40:51.040 --> 40:52.823
You're quite right about that,
Miss Cullen.

40:52.824 --> 40:56.374
We have no proof that you took
your husband's life, not yet.

40:56.655 --> 41:00.124
But I did take the liberty of sending this
footage to every news outlet in the city...

41:00.125 --> 41:04.515
including, by the way, the one
that you own or... owned.

41:05.304 --> 41:07.738
Apparently,
it's going to be a huge story.

41:07.739 --> 41:12.553
A public figure in an adulterous relationship
with the man she claimed to be her stalker?

41:12.554 --> 41:16.027
We also made sure that your late
husband's family got to see the footage.

41:16.028 --> 41:17.882
They had some interesting
things to say.

41:17.883 --> 41:20.971
They told us that you and your late
husband signed prenuptial agreements.

41:20.972 --> 41:24.224
And it turns out that even the appearance
of an adulterous relationship...

41:24.225 --> 41:27.585
is enough to render those
agreements null and void.

41:28.045 --> 41:32.372
By the way, they asked me to ask you to do
them the courtesy of skipping the funeral.

41:32.373 --> 41:34.946
They said there will be
plenty of time to catch up...

41:34.947 --> 41:38.326
when they see you in court
to contest the estate.

41:40.473 --> 41:42.123
Is there anything else?

41:43.027 --> 41:44.758
Am I free to go?

41:45.490 --> 41:46.967
You can go.

41:48.507 --> 41:52.616
But I'm not sure how,
uh, free you'll feel.

41:53.189 --> 41:56.133
I'm reopening the investigation
into your husband's death.

41:56.134 --> 41:58.048
You're the main suspect.

41:59.728 --> 42:01.756
Thanks for coming in.

42:12.604 --> 42:14.572
It's good to have you back.

42:14.957 --> 42:16.766
It's good to be here.

42:18.083 --> 42:20.383
I don't know. I have a good
feeling about this guy.

42:20.384 --> 42:22.695
I just kind of trust him.
Thank you, sweetie.

42:22.696 --> 42:25.239
And he says he's already got
a couple interviews set up for me.

42:25.240 --> 42:27.466
Well, if you're sure that's
what you want. Thanks, honey.

42:27.467 --> 42:31.522
Well, I'm not sure that it's what I want.
But I mean, nobody's offered me a job yet.

42:31.523 --> 42:34.260
Um, but when they do,
if they do, I suppose I could...

42:34.261 --> 42:36.202
I could still always turn it down.

42:36.203 --> 42:37.592
I suppose so.

42:37.855 --> 42:40.209
He wants me to get a haircut.

42:41.298 --> 42:45.173
Before the first interview. He says
he thinks it might be, uh, helpful.

42:45.174 --> 42:49.273
- Wow, are you actually going to do it?
- Yeah, I think he's probably right.

42:49.274 --> 42:51.714
Do you even know
where to get one, Daddy?

42:51.715 --> 42:52.815
Bridgette...

42:52.827 --> 42:55.227
For what it's worth,
I like the idea.

42:55.228 --> 42:57.065
Get the person who cut Mommy's.

42:57.066 --> 42:59.966
I'm not going to the hospital
to get a haircut.

43:00.052 --> 43:03.176
- You silly billy!
- Oh, my God, Mom...

43:04.253 --> 43:07.220
You're eating with your right hand.
