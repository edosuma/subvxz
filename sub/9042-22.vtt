WEBVTT

00:01.233 --> 00:02.933
- HEY, WHAT'S UP?

00:02.933 --> 00:05.100
- WANT SOME CHEESE?

00:07.300 --> 00:08.700
- WHAT IS ALL THAT?

00:08.700 --> 00:12.467
- I HELPED SOME GUY
GET A JOB AT THE PAPER,

00:12.467 --> 00:15.167
SO HE GAVE ME, LIKE,
A CHEESE SAMPLER.

00:16.700 --> 00:20.900
- YOU'VE DONE NOTHING
BUT EAT CHEESE ALL DAY.

00:20.900 --> 00:23.500
- I CAN'T STOP.

00:25.167 --> 00:26.567
- THAT'S A NICE SUITCASE.

00:26.567 --> 00:28.967
CAN I BORROW THAT
WHEN I GO ON MY HONEYMOON?

00:28.967 --> 00:30.567
- YEAH. FINE.

00:30.567 --> 00:34.233
I'M SURE THE THING
WILL STILL BE SITTIN' THERE.

00:34.233 --> 00:36.933
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

00:36.933 --> 00:38.633
- REMEMBER WHEN DEBRA AND I

00:38.633 --> 00:40.833
WENT TO CONNECTICUT
FOR THE WEEKEND?

00:40.833 --> 00:42.300
- SURE, RAYMOND.

00:42.300 --> 00:45.733
I REMEMBER EVERY ONE
OF YOUR COMINGS AND GOINGS.

00:45.733 --> 00:47.767
YOU'RE MY WHOLE LIFE.

00:49.033 --> 00:51.933
- YOU WANT TO HEAR ABOUT IT
OR NOT?

00:51.933 --> 00:53.600
- SADLY, YES.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.600
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
WE GO AWAY,

00:56.600 --> 00:59.333
AND WE ONLY TAKE
THE ONE SUITCASE WITH US.

01:00.900 --> 01:03.200
WE HAD A GOOD TIME
GETTIN' AWAY AND EVERYTHING,

01:03.200 --> 01:05.667
BUT WHEN WE GOT HOME,
WE WERE VERY TIRED,

01:05.667 --> 01:07.900
SO WE JUST
DROPPED EVERYTHING,

01:07.900 --> 01:11.967
WOKE UP THE GRUESOME TWOSOME
THAT WERE HERE BABYSITTING,

01:11.967 --> 01:13.667
AND WENT UP TO BED.

01:15.133 --> 01:18.367
THE SUITCASE
WAS SITTIN' ON THE LANDING.

01:18.367 --> 01:20.700
THAT WAS TWO WEEKS AGO.

01:23.333 --> 01:25.367
SO LIFE JUST KINDA WENT ON,

01:25.367 --> 01:26.500
BUT THEN, AFTER A FEW DAYS,

01:26.500 --> 01:29.333
I NOTICED IT WAS STILL THERE.

01:32.833 --> 01:37.200
AT FIRST, I THOUGHT DEBRA
JUST HADN'T GOTTEN TO IT YET,

01:37.200 --> 01:39.700
BUT THEN
IT WAS, LIKE, A WEEK.

01:44.500 --> 01:48.133
- SO WHY DIDN'T YOU
JUST MOVE IT YOURSELF?

01:48.133 --> 01:49.700
- BECAUSE I'M AT WORK
ALL DAY.

01:49.700 --> 01:52.833
- OH, AND WHAT DEBRA'S DOING
ISN'T WORK?

01:52.833 --> 01:55.767
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH,
YOU'RE MR. SENSITIVE.

01:55.767 --> 01:57.767
WHAT I'M SAYING IS
THAT DEBRA'S HERE.

01:57.767 --> 02:00.233
SHE'S WALKIN' BY IT
A HUNDRED TIMES A DAY.

02:00.233 --> 02:03.433
IT SHOULD BE
DRIVIN' HER NUTS BY NOW.

02:03.433 --> 02:04.967
AT THAT POINT,
I WAS LIKE, "FINE.

02:04.967 --> 02:08.333
DOESN'T BOTHER HER,
IT DOESN'T BOTHER ME."

02:10.167 --> 02:12.333
THEN A FEW DAYS LATER,

02:12.333 --> 02:14.167
I NOTICE HER
WEARING A SWEATER

02:14.167 --> 02:16.867
THAT SHE BROUGHT WITH HER
ON THE TRIP.

02:16.867 --> 02:18.333
- SO?

02:18.333 --> 02:20.967
- SO THAT MEANS SHE
TOOK IT OUT OF THE SUITCASE.

02:20.967 --> 02:23.600
IS THAT PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE
OR WHAT?

02:25.233 --> 02:27.067
SO YOU KNOW WHAT I DID?

02:27.067 --> 02:28.633
I TOOK MY CLOTHES
OUT OF THE SUITCASE TOO

02:28.633 --> 02:31.200
AND WALKED
RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER.

02:34.967 --> 02:36.733
- WHAT DID THAT DO?

02:38.133 --> 02:40.300
- NOTHIN'.

02:44.067 --> 02:45.600
THEN YESTERDAY,

02:45.600 --> 02:49.200
I STUBBED MY TOE
ON THE DAMN THING.

02:52.067 --> 02:54.100
SO I SAY,
TO NO ONE IN PARTICULAR,

02:54.100 --> 02:57.367
"HUH, THAT SUITCASE
IS STILL THERE?"

02:57.367 --> 03:00.133
AND SHE GOES,
"YEAH, I GUESS IT IS."

03:00.133 --> 03:01.533
SO NOW I DEFINITELY KNOW

03:01.533 --> 03:03.567
SHE'S NOT JUST PUTTIN' OFF
MOVIN' IT.

03:03.567 --> 03:06.433
SHE'S WAITIN' ME OUT
OR SOMETHIN'.

03:06.433 --> 03:08.533
I'LL LET YOU IN
ON A LITTLE SECRET.

03:08.533 --> 03:13.233
SHE'S GONNA BE WAITIN'
A LONG TIME.

03:17.633 --> 03:20.300
SO? WHAT DO YOU THINK?

03:27.733 --> 03:29.467
- THIS IS INSANE.

03:29.467 --> 03:32.100
- I KNOW.
WHAT'S HER PROBLEM?

03:32.100 --> 03:34.200
- NO, THE BOTH OF YOU.

03:34.200 --> 03:37.267
YOU'VE HAD A TWO-WEEK FIGHT
OVER A SUITCASE.

03:37.267 --> 03:38.967
- WELL, IT'S NOT REALLY A FIGHT,
YOU KNOW?

03:38.967 --> 03:41.467
I MEAN, EVERYTHING'S THE SAME.

03:41.467 --> 03:44.967
WE EAT. WE SLEEP.
WE WATCH TV, PLAY WITH THE KIDS.

03:44.967 --> 03:46.700
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

03:46.700 --> 03:50.533
BUT THE ONE WHO MOVES
THAT SUITCASE WILL NOT BE ME.

03:52.933 --> 03:55.633
- YOU ARE A BABY.

03:55.633 --> 03:57.933
- I AM NOT A BABY.
GIVE ME BACK MY CHEESE.

03:57.933 --> 04:00.300
- NO. HEY!

04:00.300 --> 04:01.700
- HEY, GUYS.
- HEY. HI.

04:01.700 --> 04:02.867
- HEY, DEB.

04:02.867 --> 04:04.933
- LISTEN, RAY,
I WAS GONNA ORDER PIZZA TONIGHT,

04:04.933 --> 04:06.300
BUT IF YOU'RE TOO CHEESED OUT,

04:06.300 --> 04:08.267
WE CAN JUST
GO TO THAT NEW CHICKEN PLACE.

04:08.267 --> 04:10.567
- YEAH, OKAY.
YEAH, CHICKEN SOUNDS GREAT.

04:10.567 --> 04:12.067
- OKAY.

04:17.933 --> 04:19.667
- OKAY, YOU SEE THAT?

04:19.667 --> 04:23.767
YOU SEE HOW SHE JUST WALKED PAST
IT JUST TO RUB IT IN MY FACE?

04:23.767 --> 04:26.967
- ALL I SAW WAS A WOMAN
HELPFULLY SUGGESTING

04:26.967 --> 04:29.933
A NEW CHICKEN TO HER HUSBAND.

04:29.933 --> 04:33.067
I ALWAYS LOOK FOR THE GOOD,
RAYMOND.

04:33.067 --> 04:38.733
- YEAH, 'CAUSE YOU ALREADY GOT
THE BAD AND THE UGLY.

04:38.733 --> 04:39.667
[chuckles]

04:46.167 --> 04:48.067
- HEY, TURN THE TV ON.

04:48.067 --> 04:51.233
- ACTUALLY, I'M LEAVIN'
TO COVER THE METS' ROAD TRIP.

04:51.233 --> 04:54.167
- SO TURN IT ON
AND GO.

04:57.133 --> 04:58.933
YOU GOT
ANY OF THAT CHEESE LEFT?

04:58.933 --> 05:02.200
- JUST THE ROQUEFORT, WHICH
YOU'RE MORE THAN WELCOME TO.

05:02.200 --> 05:04.400
IT REALLY STINKS BAD.

05:04.400 --> 05:05.767
- I'LL EAT IT FAST.

05:07.267 --> 05:09.067
- HEY, GUYS, COME ON.
IT'S TIME FOR BED.

05:09.067 --> 05:10.600
LET'S GO.

05:10.600 --> 05:12.767
RAY, IT'S GETTIN' LATE.
SHOULDN'T YOU PACK?

05:12.767 --> 05:14.133
- YEAH, YEAH.

05:14.133 --> 05:16.733
- WATCH IT, BOYS.
WATCH THE SUITCASE.

05:27.667 --> 05:28.767
- WHAT?

05:28.767 --> 05:32.833
- THAT SUITCASE
HAS BEEN SITTIN' THERE

05:32.833 --> 05:34.367
FOR THREE WEEKS, AND...

05:34.367 --> 05:36.467
- NOBODY WANTS TO BE
THE ONE TO MOVE IT.

05:36.467 --> 05:39.600
I GOTCHA.

05:39.600 --> 05:41.867
- BUT THE THING IS,
I GOT TO PACK NOW,

05:41.867 --> 05:46.100
SO I'M GONNA BE THE ONE
WHO HAS TO MOVE THE SUITCASE.

05:46.100 --> 05:47.967
- WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
ANOTHER SUITCASE?

05:47.967 --> 05:50.333
- NO! CAN'T LEAVE THAT ONE
SITTIN' THERE.

05:50.333 --> 05:52.933
IT'LL BE TOO OBVIOUS
THAT I DID IT ON PURPOSE.

05:52.933 --> 05:55.100
- WELL, THAT'S GOOD.

05:55.100 --> 05:56.633
DEB SHOULD KNOW
HOW YOU FEEL.

05:56.633 --> 05:58.433
I'M A GREAT BELIEVER
IN LETTING PEOPLE KNOW

05:58.433 --> 06:01.733
WHAT'S GOING ON IN HERE.

06:01.733 --> 06:05.767
- YEAH, AND EVERY OTHER
PART OF YOUR BODY.

06:10.167 --> 06:12.600
I DON'T WANT TO GET IN A FIGHT
OVER A SUITCASE

06:12.600 --> 06:15.233
RIGHT BEFORE
I HAVE TO GO.

06:15.233 --> 06:16.233
I'LL JUST DO IT.

06:16.233 --> 06:18.633
- HEY, LISTEN TO ME.

06:18.633 --> 06:21.067
THIS IS NOT
ABOUT A SUITCASE.

06:21.067 --> 06:24.767
THIS IS ABOUT WHO WEARS
THE PANTS IN THE FAMILY.

06:24.767 --> 06:26.833
WHOSE IDEA WAS IT TO BRING IT
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

06:26.833 --> 06:27.967
HERS, RIGHT?

06:27.967 --> 06:29.500
- YEAH. YEAH.

06:29.500 --> 06:31.633
THEN I WAS STUCK LUGGIN' IT
AROUND ALL WEEKEND.

06:31.633 --> 06:33.100
- IF YOU MOVE
THAT SUITCASE,

06:33.100 --> 06:34.533
YOU MIGHT AS WELL
PUT ON A DRESS

06:34.533 --> 06:39.067
AND CHANGE YOUR NAME
TO DAISY MAE TINKLEPANTS.

06:40.633 --> 06:42.200
- RAY,

06:42.200 --> 06:43.267
YOU GOT TO LEAVE SOON.

06:43.267 --> 06:44.767
ARE YOU GONNA
GET READY?

06:44.767 --> 06:47.067
- YES.

06:48.067 --> 06:49.267
YES, I AM.

07:01.833 --> 07:03.600
- WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?
- IT'S ALL RIGHT, DEB.

07:03.600 --> 07:05.067
YOU DON'T NEED
TO PRETEND WITH ME.

07:05.067 --> 07:06.967
I KNOW ALL ABOUT
THE SUITCASE.

07:06.967 --> 07:09.733
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

07:09.733 --> 07:14.300
- I KNOW ABOUT YOUR LITTLE
MEXICAN STANDOFF.

07:14.300 --> 07:17.367
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

07:17.367 --> 07:19.233
- AH, FORGET ABOUT IT.

07:19.233 --> 07:20.833
HEY, LOOKS LIKE RAY FORGOT

07:20.833 --> 07:22.167
TO TAKE
THE SUITCASE WITH HIM.

07:22.167 --> 07:25.267
YOU OUGHTA BRING IT UP.

07:29.400 --> 07:31.400
- HE HAD
THREE WEEKS!

07:34.867 --> 07:36.767
WHY DIDN'T HE MOVE THAT THING?
THREE WEEKS!

07:36.767 --> 07:38.633
AT FIRST I THOUGHT
HE WAS JUST CLUELESS,

07:38.633 --> 07:41.300
BUT IF HE TALKED TO YOU ABOUT
IT, HE KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING.

07:41.300 --> 07:42.700
- AREN'T YOU DOING
THE SAME THING?

07:42.700 --> 07:44.567
- NO! THIS IS
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.

07:44.567 --> 07:46.433
I HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING
AROUND THIS HOUSE.

07:46.433 --> 07:48.833
IF I DON'T DO IT,
IT DOESN'T GET DONE.

07:48.833 --> 07:52.133
- WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE--
NOW, TAKE IT EASY--

07:52.133 --> 07:54.300
THAT'S HOW
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE.

08:02.467 --> 08:06.300
- "THAT'S HOW
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE"?

08:06.300 --> 08:08.433
- I SAID TAKE IT EASY.

08:10.667 --> 08:12.567
RAY LUGGED THE SUITCASE
AROUND ALL WEEKEND,

08:12.567 --> 08:14.200
BUT IT'S
IN THE HOUSE NOW,

08:14.200 --> 08:15.967
ALL FULL OF LAUNDRY,

08:15.967 --> 08:20.633
AND IT'S ALL "WOMANY" NOW.

08:20.633 --> 08:23.500
SO...YOU SHOULD MOVE IT.

08:23.500 --> 08:26.600
THAT'S HOW
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE.

08:30.700 --> 08:33.533
- OKAY, NOW LET ME
TELL YOU SOMETHING.

08:33.533 --> 08:35.733
IF I'M THE ONE
THAT HAS TO DO THE LAUNDRY,

08:35.733 --> 08:36.933
WHY SHOULD I BE THE ONE

08:36.933 --> 08:38.567
TO DRAG THAT THING
UPSTAIRS, HUH?

08:38.567 --> 08:40.433
ISN'T THE MAN
SUPPOSED TO CARRY STUFF?

08:40.433 --> 08:44.700
ISN'T THAT THE "MANNY"
THING TO DO, HUH?

08:44.700 --> 08:49.267
ISN'T THAT HOW THAT'S
SUPPOSED TO BE?

08:49.267 --> 08:52.233
- OBVIOUSLY YOU'VE SPENT
A LOT MORE TIME

08:52.233 --> 08:54.067
THINKING ABOUT THIS
THAN I HAVE.

09:10.600 --> 09:12.567
- ALL PACKED.

09:15.533 --> 09:17.433
- SEE YA LATER.

09:33.267 --> 09:34.733
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

09:34.733 --> 09:37.100
- WHAT?

09:37.100 --> 09:40.600
JUST PACKIN' A SODA
FOR THE ROAD.

09:40.600 --> 09:41.867
PROBLEM?

09:41.867 --> 09:44.133
- THAT'S HOW YOU'RE
GETTING ON THE AIRPLANE?

09:44.133 --> 09:48.167
- YEAH. I'M TRAVELIN' LIGHT.
I'M TRAVELIN' LOOSE.

09:49.767 --> 09:51.633
- WHAT ARE YOU,
A HOBO?

09:54.367 --> 09:56.233
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
THE SUITCASE?

09:57.100 --> 09:58.667
- WHAT SUITCASE?

10:00.767 --> 10:03.467
- YOU KNOW WHAT SUITCASE.

10:03.467 --> 10:06.100
- ARE YOU REFERRING
TO THE SUITCASE

10:06.100 --> 10:07.633
THAT YOU HAVEN'T MOVED
IN THREE WEEKS?

10:07.633 --> 10:10.533
IS THAT THE SUITCASE
TO WHICH YOU ARE REFERRING?

10:11.600 --> 10:14.533
- WHY COULDN'T
YOU MOVE IT?

10:14.533 --> 10:17.633
- WHY COULDN'T
YOU MOVE IT?

10:17.633 --> 10:19.667
- ALL RIGHT, YOU ARE NOT
GOING TO THE AIRPORT

10:19.667 --> 10:22.067
WITH A GROCERY BAG.

10:23.567 --> 10:25.700
TAKE THE SUITCASE!

10:25.700 --> 10:26.800
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

10:26.800 --> 10:29.367
I DON'T NEED IT.

10:30.633 --> 10:32.633
- OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

10:34.733 --> 10:36.900
- OH!

10:36.900 --> 10:39.867
YEAH, GOOD.

10:39.867 --> 10:41.200
GOOD!

10:41.200 --> 10:43.700
REAL MATURE!

10:45.033 --> 10:47.500
I DON'T CARE.
I DON'T CARE.

10:47.500 --> 10:49.433
THANKS TO THE GOOD PEOPLE
AT WALDBAUM'S,

10:49.433 --> 10:52.633
I GOT A COMPLETE
SET OF LUGGAGE RIGHT HERE.

10:55.367 --> 10:59.133
ALL THE LUGGAGE I NEED
RIGHT HERE.

10:59.133 --> 11:01.533
WATERPROOF,
BEAUTIFUL LUGGAGE.

11:03.400 --> 11:06.733
RIGHT HERE,
ALL THE LUGGAGE.

11:15.567 --> 11:17.300
OOH.

11:35.533 --> 11:38.133
SEE YA
IN A COUPLE DAYS!

11:50.067 --> 11:51.067
- HI, DEBRA.

11:51.067 --> 11:52.300
- HEY, MARIE.

11:52.300 --> 11:53.933
- WHEN'S RAYMOND
COMIN' HOME?

11:53.933 --> 11:55.167
- TOMORROW AFTERNOON.

11:55.167 --> 11:56.600
I WAS JUST ON MY WAY
TO THE MARKET,

11:56.600 --> 11:58.333
AND I WAS...

12:00.700 --> 12:03.267
DEBRA, ARE YOU
COOKING SOMETHING?

12:05.433 --> 12:07.333
- NO.

12:07.333 --> 12:08.700
- OH, BECAUSE...

12:08.700 --> 12:09.900
[sniffs]

12:09.900 --> 12:12.267
THERE'S AN AROMA.

12:13.433 --> 12:16.800
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
I SMELLED IT TOO. YEAH.

12:16.800 --> 12:18.533
WOW, IT'S GETTING WORSE.

12:18.533 --> 12:20.233
- WHERE'S IT COMING FROM?

12:20.233 --> 12:22.067
- I DON'T KNOW.
UCK!

12:35.300 --> 12:38.167
- IT'S GETTING CLOSE.

12:50.767 --> 12:55.367
both: OHH!

12:55.367 --> 12:58.533
- DEBRA, YOU CAN'T KEEP
CHEESE IN A SUITCASE.

13:03.333 --> 13:06.067
- I DIDN'T
PUT IT THERE, MARIE.

13:06.067 --> 13:09.100
RAY. RAY!

13:09.100 --> 13:11.533
- ALL RIGHT, RUN.
QUICK, GET RID OF IT.

13:18.900 --> 13:21.067
- I CANNOT BELIEVE HIM.

13:21.067 --> 13:24.067
- WHY DON'T WE TAKE THE SUITCASE
OUTSIDE AND AIR IT OUT?

13:24.067 --> 13:25.067
- NO, NO, NO!

13:25.067 --> 13:26.700
WE'RE NOT MOVING IT.

13:26.700 --> 13:27.867
- BUT, DEBRA...

13:27.867 --> 13:30.633
NO. RAY DOESN'T GET TO WIN
BECAUSE OF THIS.

13:30.633 --> 13:31.700
IF SMELLS BOTHERED ME,

13:31.700 --> 13:35.067
I WOULD'VE LEFT HIM
A LONG TIME AGO.

13:38.933 --> 13:40.267
- OH, DEAR.

13:40.267 --> 13:42.400
I KNEW YOU WERE HAVING
SUITCASE PROBLEMS,

13:42.400 --> 13:44.600
BUT I DIDN'T THINK
IT HAD GOTTEN THIS BAD.

13:44.600 --> 13:48.600
- HOW DID YOU KNOW ABOUT
OUR SUITCASE PROBLEM?

13:48.600 --> 13:49.567
- COME WITH ME.

13:49.567 --> 13:51.133
I WANT TO SHOW
YOU SOMETHING.

13:51.133 --> 13:52.733
- DID FRANK
TELL YOU ABOUT THIS?

13:52.733 --> 13:54.600
- FRANK? YOU DIDN'T THINK
I'D NOTICE A SUITCASE

13:54.600 --> 13:57.633
SITTING THERE
FOR 23 1/2 DAYS?

14:01.967 --> 14:03.967
OKAY.

14:03.967 --> 14:08.233
WHAT I'M GONNA TELL YOU
I'VE NEVER TOLD ANYONE--

14:08.233 --> 14:12.300
NOT RAYMOND,
NOT ROBERT, NO ONE.

14:12.300 --> 14:15.067
- WOW, MARIE, WHAT IS IT?

14:15.067 --> 14:17.433
- WHEN FRANK AND I
GOT MARRIED,

14:17.433 --> 14:22.067
ONE OF OUR GIFTS WAS
A BIG FORK AND SPOON.

14:22.067 --> 14:24.700
- OH.

14:24.700 --> 14:25.767
I HAD ALWAYS ASSUMED

14:25.767 --> 14:28.633
THAT THOSE WERE
ROBERT'S BABY UTENSILS.

14:30.633 --> 14:33.500
- NO, THEY WERE
A WEDDING PRESENT.

14:33.500 --> 14:35.100
FRANK AND I WANTED
TO RETURN THEM

14:35.100 --> 14:37.200
THE MINUTE
WE OPENED THE BOX.

14:37.200 --> 14:38.967
- YOU DON'T LIKE
THE BIG FORK AND SPOON?

14:38.967 --> 14:41.733
- WE HATE
THE BIG FORK AND SPOON.

14:41.733 --> 14:44.200
- BUT THEY'RE LIKE
A FIXTURE OF THE HOUSE,

14:44.200 --> 14:46.167
THE BIG FORK AND SPOON.

14:46.167 --> 14:47.667
- THEY'RE HORRIBLE.
LOOK AT THEM.

14:47.667 --> 14:51.433
THEY'RE COMPLETELY
WITHOUT NUANCE.

14:51.433 --> 14:53.167
- SO WHY ARE THEY UP THERE?

14:53.167 --> 14:54.700
- I WANTED FRANK
TO RETURN THEM

14:54.700 --> 14:57.200
BECAUSE IT WAS HIS AUNT SOPHIA
THAT GAVE THEM TO ME.

14:57.200 --> 14:58.200
UGH, HIS FAMILY.

14:58.200 --> 14:59.800
I TELL YOU, DEBRA,

14:59.800 --> 15:03.633
THE GROOM'S SIDE OF THE CHURCH
WAS LIKE A GYPSY CAMP.

15:06.767 --> 15:10.333
- AND SO FRANK THOUGHT
THAT YOU SHOULD RETURN IT.

15:10.333 --> 15:13.367
- OF COURSE.
I'M THE WOMAN.

15:13.367 --> 15:16.867
THEY'RE TECHNICALLY
SILVERWARE.

15:16.867 --> 15:18.167
SO ONE DAY,

15:18.167 --> 15:19.533
AFTER MONTHS
OF THE SPOON AND THE FORK

15:19.533 --> 15:21.200
JUST SITTING
ON THE COUNTER,

15:21.200 --> 15:24.400
WE HAD A BIG FIGHT.

15:24.400 --> 15:27.467
IT WAS OUR FIRST FIGHT
AS HUSBAND AND WIFE.

15:27.467 --> 15:32.067
- WOW. THE SHOT HEARD
ROUND THE WORLD.

15:32.067 --> 15:33.667
- FINALLY, I TOLD HIM,

15:33.667 --> 15:35.633
"I'M GOING TO MY MOTHER'S,
AND WHEN I GET BACK,

15:35.633 --> 15:37.367
"YOU BETTER BE
THE ONLY UGLY THING

15:37.367 --> 15:40.567
LEFT IN THIS HOUSE."

15:44.067 --> 15:46.267
AND WHEN I GOT HOME,

15:46.267 --> 15:48.700
HE WAS SITTING
RIGHT HERE,

15:48.700 --> 15:52.633
AND HE HAD NAILED
THE SPOON TO THE WALL.

15:52.633 --> 15:54.133
- WHOA.

15:54.133 --> 15:56.800
- HE THOUGHT HE HAD WON.

15:56.800 --> 16:00.633
YOU SEE WHAT I DID?

16:00.633 --> 16:02.067
- AH, VERY CLEVER.

16:02.067 --> 16:05.600
- NOTICE THE FORK IS HIGHER.

16:09.533 --> 16:13.100
AND THEY'VE BEEN THERE
EVER SINCE.

16:13.100 --> 16:17.067
EVERY TIME I COME
INTO THIS KITCHEN,

16:17.067 --> 16:19.067
IT REMINDS ME
OF THAT FIGHT,

16:19.067 --> 16:23.433
EVERY DAY FOR 45 YEARS.

16:23.433 --> 16:25.800
- WOW, I'M SHOCKED.

16:25.800 --> 16:28.133
YOU TWO SEEM SO HAPPY.

16:32.133 --> 16:34.333
- TRUST ME, DEAR.

16:34.333 --> 16:36.767
IT'S NOT WORTH IT.

16:36.767 --> 16:39.133
GO. GO MOVE THE LUGGAGE.

16:39.133 --> 16:41.500
YOU BE THE BETTER PERSON.

16:41.500 --> 16:43.333
HMM?

16:43.333 --> 16:46.067
DON'T LET A SUITCASE
FILLED WITH CHEESE

16:46.067 --> 16:48.600
BE YOUR BIG
FORK AND SPOON.

16:55.367 --> 16:59.333
- I'VE NEVER
HEARD THAT BEFORE.

16:59.333 --> 17:02.067
- TAKE IT TO HEART, DEAR.

17:02.067 --> 17:04.667
- ALL RIGHT.
THANKS, MARIE.

17:04.667 --> 17:06.067
- OF COURSE.

17:08.833 --> 17:11.833
- HEY, WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
THE BIG FORK AND SPOON

17:11.833 --> 17:13.767
DOWN RIGHT NOW?

17:13.767 --> 17:14.933
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

17:14.933 --> 17:16.333
- WELL, IT'S BEEN 45 YEARS.

17:16.333 --> 17:19.100
WASN'T THAT THE POINT
OF YOUR STORY?

17:19.100 --> 17:24.100
- WHAT, ARE YOU TAKING
FRANK'S SIDE?

17:27.900 --> 17:29.767
- [sighs]

17:35.833 --> 17:36.900
- HI.

17:36.900 --> 17:38.367
- HEY. HI.

17:38.367 --> 17:39.867
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN' HOME?

17:39.867 --> 17:42.133
- WELL...

17:44.367 --> 17:47.367
I DECIDED
TO COME HOME EARLY.

17:47.367 --> 17:48.700
- OH.

17:48.700 --> 17:50.167
YEAH, I...

17:50.167 --> 17:52.100
YOU KNOW, I HAD
SOME TIME TO KILL

17:52.100 --> 17:53.267
WHEN I GOT TO CHICAGO,

17:53.267 --> 17:55.667
SO I WENT TO GET
A SLICE OF PIZZA.

17:55.667 --> 17:57.700
YOU KNOW, THEY GOT
THE DEEP-DISH PIZZA,

17:57.700 --> 18:01.067
AND THE CHEESE IS SO GOOD.

18:02.067 --> 18:06.367
AND I GOT TO THINKIN'...

18:06.367 --> 18:08.400
CHEESE.

18:13.667 --> 18:17.333
I LOVE IT, AND YET
I USED IT AS A WEAPON.

18:22.333 --> 18:25.967
- WELL, I'M GLAD
YOU'RE HOME.

18:25.967 --> 18:27.200
- ME TOO.

18:27.200 --> 18:29.700
I'M SORRY
THINGS GOT SO NUTS.

18:29.700 --> 18:32.533
- YEAH. ME TOO.

18:38.700 --> 18:40.600
- ARE THE KIDS HOME YET?

18:42.267 --> 18:44.300
- NO, NOT FOR
ANOTHER HOUR.

18:44.300 --> 18:47.067
- OH, 'CAUSE
I WAS THINKIN'...

18:47.067 --> 18:50.900
WE DIDN'T GET TO HAVE
OUR REGULAR GOIN'-AWAY ACTION

18:50.900 --> 18:54.200
BEFORE I LEFT.

18:54.200 --> 18:56.600
- GEE, TOUGH BREAK.

18:56.600 --> 18:59.867
- WELL, I'VE READ THAT
COMING-HOME ACTION

18:59.867 --> 19:02.833
CAN ALSO BE
RATHER PLEASANT.

19:02.833 --> 19:06.567
- YEAH, BUT YOU WERE ONLY GONE
FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS.

19:06.567 --> 19:09.200
- OH.

19:09.200 --> 19:11.333
- BUT WE DID
JUST MAKE UP.

19:11.333 --> 19:13.167
- YES. YEAH, WE DID.

19:13.167 --> 19:14.233
WE DID MAKE UP,

19:14.233 --> 19:16.400
SO WE COULD HAVE
MAKE-UP ACTION,

19:16.400 --> 19:17.600
'CAUSE WE MADE UP.

19:17.600 --> 19:20.167
WE MADE UP
SO FRICKIN' MUCH!

19:23.067 --> 19:24.200
- HEY, HEY, HEY.

19:24.200 --> 19:25.900
YOU WANT TO GET THAT?

19:25.900 --> 19:27.700
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

19:27.700 --> 19:31.600
- WELL, I MEAN, THAT'S WHY
YOU CAME HOME, RIGHT--

19:31.600 --> 19:33.100
SO YOU COULD GET IT?

19:33.100 --> 19:34.367
- WELL, YEAH,
BUT I THOUGHT...

19:34.367 --> 19:36.167
YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT
SINCE YOU KNOW

19:36.167 --> 19:37.567
I CAME ALL THE WAY
FROM CHICAGO,

19:37.567 --> 19:41.733
THAT YOU WOULD
BE THE ONE TO GET IT.

19:48.167 --> 19:50.667
- OKAY, RAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

19:50.667 --> 19:52.667
I'M GETTING IT.

19:52.667 --> 19:54.833
- WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

19:54.833 --> 19:57.067
- IT MEANS I'LL GET IT.

19:57.067 --> 20:00.967
I'LL BE THE ONE
WHO GOT IT.

20:00.967 --> 20:04.933
OH, NO, NO, NO,
NO, NO!

20:04.933 --> 20:06.167
I WILL GET IT.

20:06.167 --> 20:07.633
LET THE RECORD SHOW
THAT I GOT IT.

20:07.633 --> 20:09.467
- LET GO OF THE SUITCASE.
- YOU LET GO!

20:09.467 --> 20:13.267
YOU LET GO OF IT.
LET GO OF--

20:13.267 --> 20:15.367
LET GO,
LET GO, LET GO!

20:15.367 --> 20:17.633
LET GO!

20:17.633 --> 20:18.667
- I'M TAKING IT.

20:18.667 --> 20:20.300
- NO, YOU DON'T.
NO, YOU DON'T.

20:20.300 --> 20:21.300
- I'VE GOT IT!

20:21.300 --> 20:24.533
- NO. I'M MOVIN' IT!

20:24.533 --> 20:26.000
I'M THE ONE MOVIN' IT,
EVERYBODY.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
LOOK AT ME!

20:27.000 --> 20:28.433
- I'M STILL HOLDING IT.

20:28.433 --> 20:30.033
- IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHO'S HOLDING IT.

20:30.033 --> 20:32.467
IT MATTERS
WHO'S MOVING IT!

20:32.467 --> 20:35.067
YOU THINK YOU'RE
GONNA HOLD IT OVER ME?

20:46.700 --> 20:50.000
- HOW'S THE SUITCASE
THING GOIN'?

20:51.033 --> 20:53.133
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?

20:53.133 --> 20:54.800
- WELL, I WAS GONNA SEE
IF I CAN BORROW THAT,

20:54.800 --> 20:58.200
BUT THE AIRLINE WON'T LET ME
CARRY ON ALL THREE OF YOU.

21:07.933 --> 21:09.633
- ALL RIGHT, FRANK.

21:09.633 --> 21:11.500
TODAY'S THE DAY.

21:11.500 --> 21:14.100
THE BIG FORK AND SPOON
ARE COMING DOWN,

21:14.100 --> 21:15.900
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN ABLE
TO RISE ABOVE

21:15.900 --> 21:19.267
45 YEARS OF PETTINESS.

21:39.600 --> 21:41.600
THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT.

21:47.267 --> 21:49.600
- WHEN DID WE GET THOSE?
