WEBVTT

01:09.722 --> 01:11.072
Some good seats over here.

01:12.351 --> 01:13.251
Nicole.

01:13.447 --> 01:14.347
Eric. Hi.

01:15.086 --> 01:16.160
Avoiding me much ?

01:16.285 --> 01:18.621
Come on, you know better
than that. How you been ?

01:18.922 --> 01:20.222
You'd know if you called.

01:21.331 --> 01:22.231
I've been busy.

01:23.279 --> 01:24.548
At least he's not lying.

01:25.128 --> 01:26.278
Same thing he told me.

01:26.681 --> 01:27.591
Kellie.

01:27.790 --> 01:28.699
Hey.

01:30.407 --> 01:31.608
Man, Delko...

01:32.513 --> 01:35.754
Uh, ladies, this is D.C.
We work together.

01:36.677 --> 01:37.577
Hey.

01:39.053 --> 01:41.553
Give him a second.
He'll get up to two syllables.

01:43.620 --> 01:44.520
Good seats.

01:45.091 --> 01:47.191
Yeah, we have to get here
at, like, dawn.

01:48.917 --> 01:49.702
Check it out.

01:49.828 --> 01:51.232
Wet t-shirt contest.

01:51.859 --> 01:52.759
You all right ?

01:53.103 --> 01:55.432
Hey, man. Take it easy.
Be a little careful, all right ?

01:55.558 --> 01:57.008
How 'bout I break your nose ?

01:57.516 --> 01:59.667
- You don't want to do that ?
- Oh, yeah ? Why the hell not ?

01:59.793 --> 02:02.343
'Cause aside from giving you
a beating, I'm a cop.

02:02.924 --> 02:03.824
Oh, wow.

02:04.226 --> 02:05.562
5-0. My bad.

02:07.010 --> 02:08.060
You want to cuff me ?

02:08.598 --> 02:10.699
You guys better take
your friend out of here.

02:16.333 --> 02:17.233
So, anyway...

02:25.697 --> 02:26.597
Time.

02:35.517 --> 02:37.066
Oh, my god.
What's going on ?

02:47.489 --> 02:49.889
Everybody stand back,
alright ? Just stand back.

02:50.019 --> 02:50.919
Police.

02:57.942 --> 02:58.842
Horatio.

02:59.656 --> 03:01.856
Yeah, we got a problem here
at Lumus beach.

03:11.700 --> 03:13.587
Patrol's doing a canvas
for witnesses.

03:13.713 --> 03:15.513
Half the spectators
have been here since dawn

03:15.638 --> 03:17.003
and they didn't see anything.

03:18.219 --> 03:20.147
Big volleyball fans, I take it.

03:21.675 --> 03:24.925
It's Casper's day off.
I figured he could use the sun.

03:26.123 --> 03:28.773
This is a very strange place
to bury a body.

03:29.411 --> 03:31.961
- Unless you want that body to be found.
- Exactly.

03:32.161 --> 03:33.061
Alexx ?

03:33.828 --> 03:34.728
No id.

03:35.129 --> 03:36.679
His pockets are empty.

03:37.561 --> 03:40.197
Not exactly beachwear,
now is it, honey ?

03:41.623 --> 03:43.223
Contusions on his neck.

03:43.690 --> 03:45.944
I'm thinking ligature strangulation.

03:46.477 --> 03:48.294
Something unibodied,

03:48.528 --> 03:49.428
malleable...

03:50.206 --> 03:51.799
with a side stitch.

03:52.570 --> 03:54.520
You mean like a belt. Maybe a...

03:55.659 --> 03:57.059
maybe a man's belt.

03:57.231 --> 03:58.579
Very possible.

03:59.227 --> 04:00.833
You say that like
it means something, H.

04:00.959 --> 04:01.859
Could be, Eric.

04:02.631 --> 04:05.060
You think the killer might be
trying to get our attention ?

04:05.186 --> 04:06.086
I don't know,

04:06.739 --> 04:08.139
but he just got mine.

04:15.046 --> 04:16.733
CSI Miami Season 04 Episode 15

05:03.644 --> 05:04.744
That's odd.

05:05.695 --> 05:07.095
Look at his arms, Eric.

05:07.771 --> 05:10.271
- Yeah, one side's darker than the other.
- Yeah.

05:10.862 --> 05:12.062
It's sun exposure,

05:12.262 --> 05:14.862
like a driver who hangs
his arm out an open window.

05:15.103 --> 05:16.703
But it's his right arm.

05:17.974 --> 05:19.267
Maybe he's a mailman.

05:19.393 --> 05:21.193
They do drive on the right.

05:21.698 --> 05:23.148
Best theory we have.

05:24.979 --> 05:25.805
Delko !

05:26.331 --> 05:27.301
Check this out.

05:32.414 --> 05:33.654
You okay ? You look a little green.

05:33.780 --> 05:35.191
Did you see the body over there ?

05:35.317 --> 05:36.748
That's gross.

05:37.028 --> 05:38.807
Aren't you supposed
to be back at the lab ?

05:38.933 --> 05:41.283
Little thing called blood
caught my attention.

05:45.436 --> 05:47.236
We know our vic wasn't killed here,

05:47.937 --> 05:50.107
but he was probably
transported in this.

05:51.486 --> 05:52.486
Hang on.

06:02.018 --> 06:03.044
All right.

06:03.170 --> 06:06.228
Get this directly
to Valera in DNA, all right ?

06:06.354 --> 06:07.562
Should I get some from the vic ?

06:07.688 --> 06:09.488
No, Alexx will take care of that.

06:14.301 --> 06:16.251
Shouldn't you do that
back at the lab ?

06:20.621 --> 06:23.296
Little thing called a case breaker
just caught my eye.

06:23.422 --> 06:25.481
Belt clasp, but it's broken.

06:25.612 --> 06:28.294
- Yeah, kind you see on military belts.
- Yep. Among others.

06:28.420 --> 06:29.980
I think it's time
we go to the guard shack

06:30.106 --> 06:32.206
and find out who's
in charge of the trash.

06:35.693 --> 06:38.513
Horatio. I stopped by the place
of that girl you mentioned.

06:38.939 --> 06:40.248
Jennifer Wilson.

06:40.374 --> 06:41.504
She wasn't home.

06:41.853 --> 06:43.353
No sign of foul play.

06:43.601 --> 06:46.101
Weird thing is though her protection
unit was nowhere to be found.

06:46.227 --> 06:47.666
She let them go this morning.

06:47.792 --> 06:49.604
Jessop's her day guy.
You want me to round him up ?

06:49.730 --> 06:50.787
No need.

06:50.913 --> 06:51.913
Thank you, Frank.

06:53.183 --> 06:54.483
Officer Jessop.

06:54.653 --> 06:55.415
L ieutenant.

06:55.541 --> 06:57.251
The Jennifer Wilson detail.

06:57.377 --> 07:00.782
Like I said on the phone, she said either
we pull back or she'd give us a slip.

07:00.908 --> 07:02.041
Did she give you a reason ?

07:02.167 --> 07:03.536
Said she doesn't need
our help anymore.

07:03.662 --> 07:07.212
Yes, in spite of the fact that
her stalker killed her parents.

07:14.082 --> 07:15.707
I tried to tell her, sir,
this guy is still out there,

07:15.833 --> 07:17.007
but she wouldn't listen to reason.

07:17.133 --> 07:19.152
She's  listening
to someone, isn't she ?

07:19.278 --> 07:20.409
I'll take it from here.

07:20.535 --> 07:21.535
Thank you.

07:29.563 --> 07:31.550
You have police pick me up
at my grocery store

07:31.675 --> 07:33.564
- as if I were a common criminal ?
- Jennifer,

07:33.690 --> 07:36.940
I am sorry but you dismissed
your protection this morning. Why ?

07:37.066 --> 07:38.596
I want to be normal,

07:38.938 --> 07:40.446
live a regular life,

07:40.583 --> 07:42.033
have a relationship.

07:42.239 --> 07:43.668
So you're seeing someone ?

07:43.794 --> 07:44.793
Yes.

07:44.919 --> 07:46.209
As a matter of fact.

07:47.861 --> 07:50.374
I met him on the internet
at a dating site.

07:50.500 --> 07:51.140
O kay.

07:51.266 --> 07:52.333
What's his name ?

07:52.459 --> 07:53.771
His name is Lee.

07:56.249 --> 07:57.959
He's a really great guy.

07:59.293 --> 08:00.643
We even met a few times.

08:01.530 --> 08:02.844
You've met with Lee ?

08:03.070 --> 08:05.279
On Collins, in public, Horatio.

08:06.208 --> 08:08.199
I knew you would react like this.

08:08.325 --> 08:10.376
Jennifer, whether you realize it
or not, you're in trouble.

08:10.502 --> 08:12.102
Let me see your blackberry, please.

08:14.150 --> 08:17.050
I can't live every day of my life
hiding from Resden.

08:17.600 --> 08:20.450
He took my parents' life.
I refuse to give him mine.

08:22.052 --> 08:24.186
I understand.
Here's what I need from you.

08:24.312 --> 08:25.662
Please-- officer--

08:25.915 --> 08:26.805
please wait inside

08:26.930 --> 08:29.665
until you hear from me.
I need to check into Lee, okay ?

08:30.199 --> 08:31.499
Please do this.

08:32.102 --> 08:33.403
- All right.
- Thank you.

08:44.605 --> 08:45.266
Hey.

08:45.392 --> 08:47.203
There you are. I've been
looking all over for you.

08:47.329 --> 08:48.679
Oh, I was in the lady's.

08:49.154 --> 08:50.791
I, uh, need a favor.

08:51.150 --> 08:53.549
Delko just had some blood
dropped off with Valera.

08:53.967 --> 08:55.848
Oh, trashcan from the beach ? Yeah.

08:55.973 --> 08:57.384
Want me to compare
to my unsolved's ?

08:57.513 --> 09:00.513
I'm thinking it may help us
nail down the vic's id.

09:01.569 --> 09:02.669
Consider it done.

09:03.515 --> 09:04.699
Are you okay ?

09:04.825 --> 09:06.715
Just have a touch of the flu.

09:06.841 --> 09:08.426
Didn't you just have the flu ?

09:08.552 --> 09:10.052
Yeah, my luck, right ?

09:10.375 --> 09:12.673
Are you sure that you're all right,
'cause you're really pale.

09:12.799 --> 09:13.699
Yeah.

09:14.809 --> 09:16.359
Well, it's worse in the morning.

09:18.437 --> 09:21.614
Well, if it's worth anything, chicken soup always works for me

09:21.740 --> 09:23.140
when I have the flu.

09:23.953 --> 09:26.331
Chicken soup.
Okay, thanks.

09:27.291 --> 09:28.583
I'll get on this.

09:28.709 --> 09:29.709
Great. Thanks.

09:43.837 --> 09:46.737
<i>Hey, what's up ? This is Eric.
Leave me a message.</i>

09:47.441 --> 09:49.370
Hey, Eric. It's Natalia.

09:49.496 --> 09:50.596
I'm just, uh,

09:51.518 --> 09:52.818
just calling...

09:53.120 --> 09:54.581
to say hi and, uh,

09:54.707 --> 09:56.007
call me back.

09:56.231 --> 09:57.531
Ok.

10:03.009 --> 10:04.269
What can I do for you ?

10:04.395 --> 10:05.822
You work the beach this morning ?

10:06.348 --> 10:07.698
4:00 A.M. to noon.

10:08.069 --> 10:09.100
Why ?

10:09.226 --> 10:11.306
'Cause one of your cans
was used in a murder.

10:11.992 --> 10:12.687
No way.

10:12.813 --> 10:13.413
Yeah.

10:13.528 --> 10:15.045
Guy weighed about a buck-eighty.

10:15.171 --> 10:16.739
Would've taken one of those tractors

10:16.865 --> 10:18.808
and a guy like you
to get him out there.

10:19.414 --> 10:21.304
I don't know anything
about no murder.

10:22.483 --> 10:24.503
You're missing the belt buckle
from your uniform.

10:25.748 --> 10:26.807
Oh, must have fallen off.

10:27.333 --> 10:28.302
Guess I lost it.

10:28.428 --> 10:29.524
Well, don't worry, I found it--

10:30.050 --> 10:31.500
right next to my dead guy.

10:40.182 --> 10:41.808
He was strangled with a belt.

10:41.934 --> 10:43.198
I didn't strangle no one.

10:43.324 --> 10:45.004
Well, then you better start talking.

10:48.764 --> 10:49.504
All right.

10:50.355 --> 10:51.373
This guy, right ?

10:51.499 --> 10:52.512
He pulls up,

10:52.638 --> 10:55.238
he drops a thousand bucks
in my hand, cash.

11:02.369 --> 11:03.147
What'd he want you to do ?

11:03.273 --> 11:04.198
Dump a body.

11:04.324 --> 11:05.237
And you, you're just, uh,

11:05.363 --> 11:07.906
you're just in the habit
of dumping bodies for anyone ?

11:08.032 --> 11:09.332
I never done it before.

11:10.135 --> 11:11.042
I got scared

11:11.168 --> 11:12.718
and covered it up in the sand.

11:13.298 --> 11:14.633
What'd this guy look like ?

11:14.759 --> 11:16.003
Come on, man,

11:16.129 --> 11:17.429
it was dark.

11:17.682 --> 11:19.332
All I saw was the green.

11:20.168 --> 11:20.971
Turn around.

11:21.097 --> 11:22.907
You and your belt
are coming with me.

11:27.843 --> 11:29.312
This the body from the beach ?

11:29.438 --> 11:30.038
Yeah.

11:30.875 --> 11:31.977
I ran his prints.

11:32.103 --> 11:35.153
Federal employee. He delivered
the mail in Aventura.

11:35.759 --> 11:36.809
Did you get a name ?

11:36.935 --> 11:38.264
Oscar Vega,

11:38.424 --> 11:39.570
36.

11:39.696 --> 11:41.781
The reason I called you down, Horatio.

11:41.907 --> 11:44.871
Remember a TV show,
Ripley's believe it or not ?

11:44.997 --> 11:46.297
I do, Alexx.

11:56.140 --> 11:57.440
A key.

11:57.634 --> 12:00.213
Maybe left there,
Alexx, for us to find.

12:00.358 --> 12:02.162
Most likely postmortem.

12:03.967 --> 12:05.303
It's all yours.

12:05.630 --> 12:07.777
Did we get an address on M. Vega ?

12:13.284 --> 12:14.254
Thank you very much.

12:26.878 --> 12:28.408
Miami-Dade police !
Open up !

12:30.389 --> 12:31.765
We might need a door buster.

12:31.891 --> 12:32.706
You know what, Frank ?

12:33.262 --> 12:34.162
Try that.

12:40.998 --> 12:42.348
Right key, wrong door.

12:44.938 --> 12:46.038
Hang on a second.

12:48.434 --> 12:49.866
- Frank...
- Yep.

12:49.992 --> 12:50.992
I'm going in.

12:53.637 --> 12:54.937
Go.

13:01.227 --> 13:02.127
Are we clear ?

13:03.543 --> 13:04.238
We're clear.

13:04.864 --> 13:05.500
Clear.

13:13.121 --> 13:14.021
This one's gone.

13:17.953 --> 13:19.303
Yeah, this one, too.

13:19.662 --> 13:21.482
Frank, this is Resden work.

13:22.072 --> 13:22.807
Resden ?

13:23.303 --> 13:23.947
You sure ?

13:24.073 --> 13:25.323
The bodies are configured

13:25.448 --> 13:28.023
in the same way that
Jennifer Wilson's parents were.

13:36.779 --> 13:38.796
- The Wilson bodies up in New York ?
- That's correct.

13:38.922 --> 13:40.309
Female dragged.

13:42.649 --> 13:43.928
Eyes open.

13:44.054 --> 13:45.904
Not in proximity of the phone.

13:46.577 --> 13:48.008
Male prone.

13:49.610 --> 13:51.022
And belt missing.

13:55.718 --> 13:57.500
Frank, you know
where he leaves a child ?

14:00.029 --> 14:01.329
In a closet.

14:09.931 --> 14:10.531
Jennifer.

14:11.970 --> 14:12.970
Is it safe ?

14:25.237 --> 14:26.105
Empty.

14:26.531 --> 14:28.556
According to the file,
our mailman's a bachelor,

14:28.682 --> 14:29.558
no kids.

14:30.084 --> 14:31.167
Small favors, huh ?

14:31.293 --> 14:33.243
No such luck for this couple, Frank.

14:34.165 --> 14:35.565
Jennifer, stay at the station.

14:35.688 --> 14:38.000
Stay right where you are.
Resden is back.

14:52.490 --> 14:54.309
Hey Cooper, I thought
today was your day off.

14:54.924 --> 14:57.062
- Helping Delko with a case.
- Oh, have you seen him ?

14:57.188 --> 14:58.635
He got a call and took off.

14:58.761 --> 15:00.580
Probably one of the babes
from the volleyball tournament.

15:00.706 --> 15:01.413
What ?

15:01.539 --> 15:03.038
Yeah. We were at
the championships this morning.

15:03.164 --> 15:04.058
Beach volleyball.

15:04.184 --> 15:06.178
Wall-to-wall thongs.

15:07.245 --> 15:08.103
Really ?

15:08.529 --> 15:09.868
Yeah. Delko knew every chick there.

15:09.994 --> 15:11.705
I  am talking playa.

15:12.133 --> 15:12.733
I should

15:12.828 --> 15:13.969
definitely hang out with him more,

15:14.095 --> 15:15.405
take some of his rejects.

15:18.125 --> 15:20.705
Hey, Boa Vista, I'll let him know
you're looking for him.

15:24.161 --> 15:26.036
Hey, Natalia,
I just got your message.

15:26.462 --> 15:27.362
Sure you did.

15:36.006 --> 15:37.156
What's with Boa Vista ?

15:37.807 --> 15:38.516
You got me.

15:38.642 --> 15:40.456
She was just here.
You say anything to her ?

15:40.582 --> 15:41.482
No.

15:44.657 --> 15:45.557
What ?

15:46.296 --> 15:48.673
We  were talking about the tournament.
I was telling her about

15:48.799 --> 15:51.449
all the hot chicks, how you got
all their phone numbers...

15:51.574 --> 15:52.749
You got a big mouth.

15:53.234 --> 15:55.090
- What'd I do ?
- You opened it.

15:57.873 --> 16:00.873
- Oh, you and Boa Vista are... ?
- Are none of your business.

16:01.283 --> 16:02.883
Dude, I didn't know. I'm sorry.

16:08.370 --> 16:09.520
This is Resden's work.

16:13.058 --> 16:13.952
Maybe someone saw

16:14.078 --> 16:16.311
the pictures of my parents' murder
in the paper and copied it.

16:16.437 --> 16:17.206
Jennifer,

16:17.332 --> 16:18.232
it's him.

16:20.200 --> 16:22.850
But something else is going on,
Horatio. What is it ?

16:24.101 --> 16:26.101
The man you're seeing
is Walter Resden.

16:28.690 --> 16:29.740
I don't believe you.

16:30.968 --> 16:31.578
Jennifer,

16:31.704 --> 16:34.611
we traced Lee's e-mails
to a cafe on Flagler,

16:34.756 --> 16:36.581
and the owner identified Lee

16:36.912 --> 16:38.062
as Walter Resden.

16:38.572 --> 16:40.412
Lee is Walter's middle name.

16:41.013 --> 16:41.720
No,

16:41.846 --> 16:44.627
I would recognize him. I saw
the man that murdered my parents.

16:44.753 --> 16:47.503
- I'll never forget his face.
- You were ten years old.

16:50.846 --> 16:52.046
It's for your own good.

17:06.082 --> 17:06.853
I...

17:06.979 --> 17:08.429
I asked Lee to meet me here.

17:10.643 --> 17:11.443
That's him ?

17:27.271 --> 17:28.671
What are you doing, Walter ?

17:29.138 --> 17:30.288
I'm here for Jennifer.

17:30.843 --> 17:31.743
We're in love.

17:32.551 --> 17:34.451
Lee, is it true
you're Walter Resden ?

17:34.781 --> 17:36.472
Walter Lee Resden.

17:36.614 --> 17:38.214
I dropped the Walter years ago.

17:39.656 --> 17:41.116
What else have you lied about ?

17:41.242 --> 17:43.193
Walter, don't you think
you'd better tell her ?

17:43.319 --> 17:44.711
Nothing, nothing.

17:45.315 --> 17:47.476
We met each other
on an anonymous dating site.

17:47.602 --> 17:49.586
I didn't know you,
and you didn't know me.

17:49.712 --> 17:52.426
It was only until we actually met
that I figured out who you were.

17:52.552 --> 17:54.699
By then, it was too late.
I already was in love with you.

17:54.825 --> 17:57.641
You could have told me you were
a suspect in my parents' murder.

17:57.767 --> 18:00.138
I know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
But I'm telling you now,

18:00.264 --> 18:03.164
I had absolutely nothing to do
with your parents' murder.

18:03.612 --> 18:06.397
I left New York, I changed my name
to get away from this man

18:06.523 --> 18:09.377
- and his debilitating accusations.
- Jennifer, he's lying to you.

18:09.503 --> 18:11.701
He left New York because
I almost had him on murder.

18:11.827 --> 18:13.405
- Isn't that true, Walter ?
- He didn't have anything ;

18:13.531 --> 18:15.846
he doesn't know what he's talking
about-- are you ready to go ?

18:15.972 --> 18:17.711
You're not going anywhere, Walter.

18:17.837 --> 18:19.987
You are going inside
for an interrogation.

18:20.675 --> 18:22.201
Interrogation, for what ?

18:22.416 --> 18:26.316
We are processing a crime scene that
has your signature all over it. Officer.

18:29.346 --> 18:31.637
I'm happy to indulge the lieutenant,

18:33.495 --> 18:35.500
but this is all a very big mistake.

18:39.318 --> 18:40.218
Take him.

18:48.516 --> 18:50.116
What if you're wrong about him ?

18:51.785 --> 18:52.685
What if I'm not ?

19:09.485 --> 19:10.383
I  don't get it.

19:10.509 --> 19:11.799
Resden kills the mail carrier,

19:11.924 --> 19:13.799
gets someone to dump
his body at the beach,

19:14.125 --> 19:15.774
then he brings two vics
to the guy's house ?

19:15.900 --> 19:16.800
Killer's logic.

19:17.162 --> 19:18.462
Only understood backward.

19:20.489 --> 19:21.589
You clear a path ?

19:22.147 --> 19:23.297
Suspect did it for us.

19:24.818 --> 19:26.418
Resden's a bit of a neat freak.

19:32.118 --> 19:33.259
Multiple stab wounds.

19:35.567 --> 19:36.656
No blood pool.

19:40.227 --> 19:41.538
No marks on her neck.

19:42.113 --> 19:44.377
If he didn't strangle them,
what's the belt for ?

19:44.503 --> 19:45.741
I think he's big into messages.

19:45.867 --> 19:47.967
He's left a man's belt
at every crime scene,

19:48.092 --> 19:49.967
whether he ligatured his vic or not.

19:50.940 --> 19:53.190
Hey, what's the ambient
temperature in here ?

19:54.065 --> 19:54.965
Air's off.

19:55.746 --> 19:57.996
I would say it's got
to be about 90 degrees.

19:58.901 --> 20:00.060
This body's cool.

20:02.241 --> 20:03.411
Like it's been here awhile ?

20:03.537 --> 20:04.379
No,

20:04.505 --> 20:05.536
I mean cool.

20:09.742 --> 20:12.592
This body feels colder than
the surrounding temperature.

20:12.884 --> 20:13.834
That's impossible.

20:14.137 --> 20:16.037
Impossible without
some kind of help.

20:17.946 --> 20:19.916
Her liver temp is 72 degrees.

20:20.477 --> 20:22.327
Do you think they were
refrigerated ?

20:23.250 --> 20:24.409
At this core temp,

20:25.315 --> 20:26.615
I think they were frozen.

20:27.671 --> 20:28.871
Then the TOD's way off.

20:29.547 --> 20:31.597
At least until
I get back to the office.

20:31.796 --> 20:34.096
I'm going to let
Horatio know TOD is pending.

20:34.319 --> 20:35.219
Thanks, Alexx.

20:39.535 --> 20:40.435
Pine cleaner.

20:40.627 --> 20:41.448
What ?

20:41.574 --> 20:42.674
I smell pine cleaner.

20:45.543 --> 20:46.443
You're right.

20:47.268 --> 20:48.718
This place has been cleaned.

20:48.905 --> 20:51.658
Suspect wanted to make sure
he didn't leave any evidence behind.

20:51.784 --> 20:54.834
Yeah, but aromas are airborne.
I bet he got some on himself.

20:55.802 --> 20:56.702
I'll be at PD.

21:01.034 --> 21:01.934
Look, Manuel,

21:02.453 --> 21:06.403
your belt is not the murder weapon,
but you are still sitting in the hot seat.

21:07.486 --> 21:08.386
I can't be sure.

21:08.538 --> 21:09.257
It was dark.

21:09.383 --> 21:11.797
You said a man paid you
to dump the postal worker.

21:11.923 --> 21:13.286
Well, if that's true,
he murdered him.

21:13.412 --> 21:15.287
Now, if you can't I.D. him,
you're going to hang for this.

21:15.413 --> 21:17.952
I got no problem giving him up.
I just can't tell.

21:18.078 --> 21:20.502
Nothing like a little
jail time to help your memory.

21:20.628 --> 21:21.528
Let's go.

21:34.525 --> 21:35.825
Texan's working the case.

21:37.420 --> 21:38.620
Doesn't look too happy.

21:39.079 --> 21:40.329
Eyewitness fell through.

21:41.045 --> 21:42.795
There's all kinds of eyewitnesses.

21:43.482 --> 21:44.382
Stand up, please.

21:46.582 --> 21:47.643
What is that ?

21:50.033 --> 21:53.000
Lieutenant Caine mentioned that your
clothing smelled like pine cleaner,

21:53.626 --> 21:55.376
which we found at the crime scene.

21:55.869 --> 21:57.969
Bodies at the mail
carrier's were frozen.

21:58.204 --> 21:59.780
Really. How odd.

22:00.111 --> 22:01.854
What exactly is this device doing ?

22:01.980 --> 22:03.850
Identifying the components
in the pine cleaner

22:03.975 --> 22:06.435
to determine if you were there
at the crime scene.

22:06.856 --> 22:08.847
Well, I don't know about
your crime scene, but I

22:08.973 --> 22:11.573
- did clean out my trunk this morning.
- No kidding.

22:11.870 --> 22:13.217
Yeah, I got some mud in there.

22:13.343 --> 22:15.370
New plants for the lanai.

22:15.635 --> 22:16.535
New plants.

22:16.738 --> 22:18.110
Mind if I take a look at that trunk ?

22:18.236 --> 22:20.186
Of course not.
I have nothing to hide.

22:26.853 --> 22:27.753
Hey.

22:27.923 --> 22:28.823
Hey.

22:29.399 --> 22:31.649
I tested the trunk for blood.
It's negative.

22:31.971 --> 22:33.071
Doesn't clear Resden.

22:33.660 --> 22:37.100
The mail carrier was strangled, so there
wouldn't be much blood to begin with.

22:37.596 --> 22:39.999
Well, that's true. Someone
cleaned all the evidence--

22:40.125 --> 22:41.925
saliva, hair.
There's nothing here.

22:51.950 --> 22:56.150
Pine components here and on Resden match
the stuff we found around the dead couple.

22:56.736 --> 22:58.636
Is pine cleaner enough
to arrest him ?

22:59.972 --> 23:01.122
I honestly don't know.

23:01.456 --> 23:03.006
It's up to the state attorney.

23:03.284 --> 23:05.286
Horatio's going to want
to make the call.

23:05.412 --> 23:07.662
Yes, sir, this man
is extremely dangerous...

23:08.240 --> 23:10.517
and the pine cleaner
is directly connected.

23:11.453 --> 23:12.703
Yes, to the crime scene.

23:13.337 --> 23:14.237
Yes, sir...

23:14.847 --> 23:15.747
I understand.

23:16.972 --> 23:17.872
Yes, sir.

23:19.754 --> 23:20.854
According to the, uh,

23:22.080 --> 23:23.480
state attorney, we don't...

23:25.191 --> 23:27.841
we don't have enough to hold
our friend Walter here.

23:28.587 --> 23:29.837
We got to cut him loose ?

23:31.111 --> 23:32.011
So...

23:33.821 --> 23:35.504
I guess I'm free to go.

23:36.256 --> 23:37.156
For now.

23:38.700 --> 23:41.250
Well, I'll just collect Jennifer
and be on my way.

23:41.874 --> 23:43.760
- Isn't she something ?
- Walter,

23:44.435 --> 23:46.185
if you do anything to this girl...

23:46.327 --> 23:48.077
I hope you write this down,
detective Tripp.

23:48.201 --> 23:49.977
This man is threatening me.

23:50.198 --> 23:51.994
Walter, why are you here ?

23:52.345 --> 23:53.895
You don't care about Jennifer.

23:54.782 --> 23:55.682
What do you want ?

23:56.438 --> 23:58.188
Oh, I want what you want, Horatio.

23:59.084 --> 23:59.984
Resolution.

24:06.753 --> 24:07.653
Ready ?

24:24.241 --> 24:25.074
Hey.

24:25.200 --> 24:26.314
Hey, I've been looking for you.

24:26.440 --> 24:27.540
Yeah, I've been busy.

24:27.916 --> 24:29.166
Look, hear me out, okay ?

24:30.239 --> 24:32.189
You have until
the elevator gets here.

24:33.582 --> 24:35.432
- Dan Cooper has a big mouth.
- Yeah,

24:35.795 --> 24:37.861
- but is he a liar ?
- No, he just talks too much.

24:37.987 --> 24:39.491
But pretty pointedly,
though, I would say.

24:39.617 --> 24:42.697
Beach volleyball with half-naked
girls writhing in the sand.

24:43.386 --> 24:44.836
And those are just the fans.

24:45.335 --> 24:46.585
Look, Natalia, you and I

24:47.516 --> 24:50.116
weren't exclusive. I mean,
we said that, didn't we ?

24:51.460 --> 24:52.360
We did.

24:53.860 --> 24:55.610
I think I said it first, actually.

24:56.132 --> 24:57.532
So then, why all the drama ?

24:59.185 --> 25:00.085
Eric...

25:03.938 --> 25:04.838
what ?

25:06.440 --> 25:07.340
Forget it.

25:08.267 --> 25:10.590
Look, I don't want to forget it. You
were going to tell me something. What ?

25:10.716 --> 25:13.068
- There are just complications, okay ?
- Complications like what ?

25:13.194 --> 25:14.722
- I'm late.
- For what ?

25:15.960 --> 25:17.760
- I'm late.
- Oh, my god.

25:18.321 --> 25:19.520
W-wait, Natalia, wait.

25:21.039 --> 25:21.639
It's

25:21.743 --> 25:23.343
easier if you press the button.

25:24.192 --> 25:25.551
Yeah. Thanks, Paula.

25:27.635 --> 25:28.535
Talk to me.

25:28.757 --> 25:30.157
What do you want me to say ?

25:32.023 --> 25:34.823
Look, you can't drop some news
on me like that and then run.

25:34.949 --> 25:36.449
Now, are you sure about this ?

25:37.228 --> 25:40.456
Those home tests don't really work on me,
and my doctor can't see me till this afternoon.

25:40.582 --> 25:41.906
All right, and then
after you see him ?

25:42.032 --> 25:43.165
- Her.
- Her. Then...

25:43.984 --> 25:44.984
then what do we do ?

25:49.948 --> 25:50.848
What ?

25:51.796 --> 25:52.696
It's nothing.

25:53.327 --> 25:54.360
Something. What ?

25:55.171 --> 25:56.321
It's just nice that...

25:57.722 --> 25:58.622
you said we.

26:00.313 --> 26:01.613
Takes two to tango.

26:02.997 --> 26:05.975
Look, you know I haven't been
with anyone since my divorce.

26:06.101 --> 26:07.427
- I know.
- No, I mean, anyone.

26:07.553 --> 26:08.453
Look, I know.

26:08.704 --> 26:09.804
I believe you, Talia.

26:10.846 --> 26:11.746
Okay ?

26:12.688 --> 26:13.588
Now, look,

26:14.425 --> 26:17.171
I'd go with you this afternoon, but
I just... I can't get off this case.

26:17.297 --> 26:18.697
It's-it's okay. No worries.

26:19.222 --> 26:20.109
Please call me

26:20.235 --> 26:21.698
as soon as you know something.

26:21.824 --> 26:22.724
I promise.

26:23.635 --> 26:24.535
Okay.

26:34.161 --> 26:35.061
Hey.

26:35.960 --> 26:36.591
Hey.

26:36.717 --> 26:38.234
Tox, huh ?
You're working double duty ?

26:38.360 --> 26:39.781
They haven't found
my replacement yet,

26:39.907 --> 26:42.989
and Alexx needed a rush on the
couple's stomach content analysis.

26:43.115 --> 26:45.284
Is that the couple they found
at postal worker's house ?

26:45.410 --> 26:48.274
Alexx couldn't id them, but
she did get an approximate TOD.

26:48.400 --> 26:51.400
They had freezer burn, and
that takes three months to form.

26:57.629 --> 26:59.679
So, they've been dead
three months plus.

26:59.811 --> 27:01.301
No decomp.
Three months even.

27:01.427 --> 27:03.041
Missing persons may have something.

27:03.167 --> 27:05.751
Not florida's. I hit a dead end
in the sunshine state.

27:05.877 --> 27:07.527
Well, there are 49 other states.

27:07.987 --> 27:11.908
That is exactly why I decided to come
at it from a different angle. Take a look.

27:12.034 --> 27:13.237
The couple's stomach contents--

27:13.363 --> 27:14.263
it's chili.

27:15.439 --> 27:17.053
Yeah ? Well, there's
a lot of that around.

27:17.179 --> 27:18.213
The white stuff in it--

27:18.339 --> 27:19.239
it's pasta.

27:20.516 --> 27:21.416
Pasta in chili ?

27:21.845 --> 27:24.045
That is the unofficial grub
of southern Ohio.

27:24.170 --> 27:26.345
That, my friend,
is Cincinnati chili.

27:26.497 --> 27:27.228
Okay, so,

27:27.354 --> 27:29.176
maybe our missing
couple's from Ohio ?

27:29.302 --> 27:29.902
Great.

27:29.989 --> 27:33.239
I already put an inquiry into the
Cincinnati PD missing persons.

27:34.821 --> 27:35.800
Clint and Beverly Holtz.

27:35.925 --> 27:38.501
Reported missing from
their house three months ago.

27:39.385 --> 27:40.920
Why would you freeze
a couple in Ohio,

27:41.045 --> 27:42.705
and then transport them to Florida ?

27:42.781 --> 27:43.781
I don't know,

27:44.084 --> 27:47.234
but three months, 2,000 miles ?
He had to have a freezer truck.

27:47.629 --> 27:49.582
I'll call homicide,
have them put out a bolo.

27:49.708 --> 27:51.308
Great. I'll meet you in layout.

27:53.140 --> 27:54.540
So, I've gotten the murder books

27:54.665 --> 27:57.240
from all the cases
potentially linked to Resden.

27:57.714 --> 27:59.464
Multiple murders, multiple cities.

28:00.791 --> 28:01.691
The wilsons ?

28:02.333 --> 28:05.133
No. Horatio said that murder
was about his old partner.

28:05.388 --> 28:08.294
So, we've got nine vics
and a lot of geography.

28:09.077 --> 28:11.077
What do all those cases
have in common ?

28:12.097 --> 28:14.682
Well, I'm thinking, since they're all
adults, and from different states,

28:14.808 --> 28:17.068
we should start from
the childhood and work forward.

28:17.194 --> 28:19.194
Preschools, music lessons,
summer camp.

28:20.485 --> 28:22.410
There are at least
1,000 pages in this one.

28:22.536 --> 28:24.086
Okay, two for you, two for me.

28:54.218 --> 28:57.453
The vics were born
between 1964 and 1967.

28:57.594 --> 29:00.061
Brett Flanders, '64,
Keith Oakland...

29:00.986 --> 29:01.886
'65.

29:02.398 --> 29:05.695
They both have New York driver's
licenses issued in the sametown.

29:05.821 --> 29:07.021
Yeah, all the male vics

29:07.468 --> 29:08.832
except for the Orlando guy,

29:08.958 --> 29:10.808
lived in New York in the early '80s.

29:12.358 --> 29:13.513
Case has to be connected.

29:13.638 --> 29:16.113
I-I just can't find
a New York tie for the husband.

29:16.239 --> 29:17.789
Maybe the target was the wife.

29:18.094 --> 29:19.444
Check out her maiden name.

29:21.413 --> 29:22.313
Sanderly.

29:22.844 --> 29:23.944
That's still Florida.

29:24.830 --> 29:28.338
If it was the early '80s, they would
have all been around 16 years old.

29:28.464 --> 29:31.014
See if you can pull up
her first driver's license.

29:35.997 --> 29:37.547
Nassau County, New York.

29:38.158 --> 29:40.508
Pull up the driver's licenses
of the other two guys.

29:45.915 --> 29:47.065
Look at the addresses.

29:49.608 --> 29:51.308
They all lived in the same house.

29:54.731 --> 29:56.081
They were foster kids.

29:56.985 --> 30:00.022
For 26 months, the early '80s,
these vics and Walter Resden

30:00.936 --> 30:03.476
lived with foster parents
Morris and Helen Yates.

30:03.754 --> 30:06.954
According to the file, the mother
died of natural causes ten years ago.

30:07.080 --> 30:09.043
But before that,
they took in seven foster kids.

30:09.169 --> 30:10.654
Wait a second. You said seven.

30:10.780 --> 30:13.230
There's only six here.
Somebody's missing, Ryan.

30:13.407 --> 30:14.307
John Massry.

30:14.792 --> 30:15.842
Lives here in Miami.

30:16.911 --> 30:18.102
Think he's our next victim ?

30:18.228 --> 30:20.278
I don't know. We need
an address on him.

30:22.973 --> 30:24.817
3775 harper avenue.

30:25.616 --> 30:26.866
- I'll run him.
- Do it.

30:27.944 --> 30:28.844
Yeah, Frank,

30:29.176 --> 30:31.424
we just found a house
to fit our key.

30:54.685 --> 30:55.585
Miami Dade PD !

31:03.068 --> 31:03.968
Miami Dade PD.

31:04.428 --> 31:05.328
What's going on ?

31:05.585 --> 31:06.585
You John Massry ?

31:07.216 --> 31:08.868
Yes. What the hell
are you doing in my house ?

31:08.994 --> 31:10.820
I'm here to talk
about Walter Resden.

31:10.946 --> 31:11.915
What about him ?

31:12.378 --> 31:14.328
You two were
foster brothers together ?

31:14.846 --> 31:15.544
Us and

31:15.670 --> 31:16.570
five other kids.

31:16.779 --> 31:20.033
And you were arrested for choking
your foster father, Morris Yates ?

31:20.159 --> 31:21.959
Report says, you were using a belt.

31:22.214 --> 31:25.464
I'm a little vague on the details.
It was a long time ago.

31:26.766 --> 31:27.977
How did you get in here ?

31:28.103 --> 31:29.003
Used your key.

31:29.238 --> 31:31.038
We found it in a dead man's throat.

31:31.236 --> 31:31.836
What ?!

31:31.948 --> 31:33.416
Have you been to the beach lately ?

31:33.542 --> 31:34.805
I haven't been
out of the house all day.

31:34.931 --> 31:36.681
Well, you got sand on your carpet.

31:37.799 --> 31:38.436
So ?

31:38.562 --> 31:40.912
One of our murder victims
was covered in sand.

31:44.817 --> 31:45.817
You use that a lot ?

31:46.849 --> 31:48.556
- Yeah.
- Mind if we take a look around ?

31:48.682 --> 31:49.582
Okay.

31:50.709 --> 31:51.609
Check it out.

31:58.716 --> 31:59.633
Hey-hey, the...

32:03.517 --> 32:04.417
Detective ?

32:07.832 --> 32:09.032
Well, what do you know.

32:09.215 --> 32:10.115
Mr. Pine.

32:11.504 --> 32:13.354
Got to be at least 50 bottles there.

32:13.510 --> 32:15.589
It's enough to cover up
quite a few murders.

32:15.715 --> 32:17.842
- Are you working with Walter Resden ?
- No.

32:17.968 --> 32:18.868
Sure you're not.

32:19.979 --> 32:21.129
Outside, Einstein.

32:25.936 --> 32:27.918
I swear the sand came
from the delivery guy.

32:28.044 --> 32:29.794
What about the pine cleaner, John ?

32:30.585 --> 32:31.903
I use it around the house.

32:32.029 --> 32:34.379
And at the letter carrier's
house, too, right ?

32:35.657 --> 32:37.657
I don't know what
you're talking about.

32:37.828 --> 32:38.946
You and Walter,

32:39.140 --> 32:41.475
John, were in the same
foster home, weren't you ?

32:41.601 --> 32:43.301
It was the worst time in my life.

32:43.876 --> 32:44.926
The Yates were pigs.

32:45.232 --> 32:47.932
The place was filthy.
If it wasn't mud, it was blood.

32:48.408 --> 32:50.158
Old man Yates beat you, didn't he ?

32:50.663 --> 32:52.013
Wally got the worst of it.

32:53.199 --> 32:54.099
Dad

32:54.451 --> 32:55.751
beat the crap out of him.

32:56.021 --> 32:56.921
With a belt,

32:57.157 --> 32:57.903
right ?

32:58.029 --> 32:58.929
His belt.

32:59.211 --> 33:01.561
We'd hear him taking it off,
and we would run.

33:02.379 --> 33:03.388
But Wally was slow.

33:04.275 --> 33:05.335
He'd throw him in a closet,

33:05.461 --> 33:06.411
lock him in there.

33:06.631 --> 33:07.531
Hours.

33:07.720 --> 33:08.770
Sometimes overnight.

33:10.852 --> 33:12.652
You're not worth that county checks.

33:12.932 --> 33:14.332
No, please, not the closet.

33:17.203 --> 33:18.853
You're lucky it's not the grave.

33:25.370 --> 33:27.220
One day, I couldn't take it anymore.

33:27.546 --> 33:28.746
So you stood up to him ?

33:29.661 --> 33:30.561
I tried to.

33:32.274 --> 33:33.674
He was beating Wally again.

33:35.692 --> 33:36.942
Get the hell off of him !

33:39.388 --> 33:40.738
You think you can take me ?

33:41.286 --> 33:41.970
Yeah,

33:42.096 --> 33:42.996
I do.

33:44.801 --> 33:45.701
Ow !

33:54.254 --> 33:55.154
I'm sorry, Wally.

33:55.383 --> 33:56.283
I'm really sorry.

33:56.487 --> 33:57.687
It's all right, Johnny.

33:58.571 --> 33:59.471
You tried.

34:01.524 --> 34:03.474
He tossed me out.
I ended up in juvie.

34:04.699 --> 34:06.254
I guess Wally ended up even worse.

34:06.380 --> 34:09.625
You know that Walter has killed
his other foster siblings, right ?

34:09.751 --> 34:10.722
- All ?
- Mm-hmm.

34:12.233 --> 34:14.114
- Well, why not me ?
- You stood up for him.

34:14.239 --> 34:15.139
Yeah, but

34:15.536 --> 34:17.286
it got worse for Wally after that.

34:18.636 --> 34:20.636
I mean, the old man
took it out on him.

34:20.882 --> 34:22.080
Why did he steal my key ?

34:22.206 --> 34:23.670
Because he wanted you

34:24.176 --> 34:26.039
to tell me his story, John.

34:44.161 --> 34:45.860
I understand.
Stay on it, please.

34:46.306 --> 34:46.907
Eric.

34:47.030 --> 34:49.223
Just found an abandoned ice truck
near the Orange Bowl.

34:49.349 --> 34:51.559
- All right, I'll bring it in and process it.
- Do it.

35:04.147 --> 35:05.692
Thought you were going to
call me as soon as you got out.

35:05.818 --> 35:06.718
Battery died.

35:08.443 --> 35:09.343
So ?

35:10.131 --> 35:11.031
False alarm.

35:11.383 --> 35:12.283
Oh, man.

35:13.257 --> 35:14.157
Ah. Wait.

35:14.618 --> 35:15.518
Is she sure ?

35:15.777 --> 35:18.036
Positive, 100%-- she said
I must have picked up the flu.

35:18.162 --> 35:19.123
Oh, that's good.

35:19.580 --> 35:20.926
- I mean...
- No, it's great,

35:21.052 --> 35:22.035
it's great.

35:22.546 --> 35:23.446
Big relief.

35:24.966 --> 35:26.116
Well, should we, uh...

35:26.550 --> 35:28.350
well, that's what got us into this.

35:31.847 --> 35:33.663
I think maybe we went
a little too fast.

35:33.789 --> 35:34.389
Yeah.

35:34.511 --> 35:35.411
Yeah, probably.

35:36.664 --> 35:38.497
All right. Well,
I'm running on a case.

35:38.623 --> 35:40.123
Oh, go, go ;
we'll talk later.

35:41.599 --> 35:42.499
Okay.

36:06.626 --> 36:07.790
According to homicide,

36:07.915 --> 36:11.415
this freezer truck was stolen
in Ohio just over three months ago.

36:11.531 --> 36:14.343
Yeah, that's consistent with the time of death of our vics from Ohio.

36:14.469 --> 36:15.205
So

36:15.331 --> 36:17.764
we need to find evidence
of the victims in the freezer

36:17.890 --> 36:19.840
and evidence of
the driver in the cab.

36:20.160 --> 36:21.410
You want to flip a coin ?

36:21.604 --> 36:22.504
No.

36:23.099 --> 36:24.799
I've had all my luck for the day.

36:25.158 --> 36:26.208
I'll take the front.

36:39.221 --> 36:40.421
More pine cleaner here.

36:42.660 --> 36:44.360
He definitely wiped the cab down.

36:51.069 --> 36:52.269
Looking bad for Resden.

36:53.735 --> 36:54.935
Anything where you are ?

36:56.867 --> 36:58.967
Looks like Resden
didn't clean back here.

37:00.625 --> 37:02.125
I got hair and biologicals...

37:04.130 --> 37:07.880
Yeah, well,I don't think he cared about
us tying the truck to the victims.

37:08.793 --> 37:11.143
He cared about us tying
the truck back to him.

37:27.255 --> 37:28.155
Gold mine.

37:30.170 --> 37:31.070
I got zero.

37:32.411 --> 37:34.361
Resden wiped the cab clean, smart guy.

37:36.593 --> 37:37.643
I got to be smarter.

37:38.914 --> 37:41.244
Suspect only cleans
what they can see.

38:16.255 --> 38:18.105
- Here it is, lieutenant.
- Thank you.

38:19.450 --> 38:20.053
Okay,

38:20.179 --> 38:22.729
- this puts Resden in the truck.
- And behind bars.

38:23.211 --> 38:25.461
- So what's next ?
- First, we find him, Eric.

38:25.721 --> 38:26.951
What do you mean ?
I thought he was with Jennifer.

38:27.077 --> 38:29.457
No note, no explanation,
he just left.

38:30.874 --> 38:31.774
So now what ?

38:32.009 --> 38:33.209
Where is the next clue ?

38:33.419 --> 38:34.544
Back to the beginning.

38:34.670 --> 38:37.450
- The New York case, Jennifer's parents ?
- And the file he gave me.

38:42.469 --> 38:44.119
The photographs on the table

38:45.460 --> 38:47.060
are from the New York file.

38:48.708 --> 38:49.608
And these

38:49.919 --> 38:51.285
are from the Resden file.

38:52.736 --> 38:53.373
Right,

38:53.499 --> 38:55.549
the one that he sent you
six months ago.

38:57.338 --> 39:00.188
- Is there something new ?
- Eric, there is something new.

39:01.401 --> 39:02.551
What's the difference ?

39:04.248 --> 39:05.148
There's no mail.

39:05.511 --> 39:06.818
Bring that light over, please.

39:06.944 --> 39:08.544
He photoshopped the letters in.

39:10.078 --> 39:11.044
It's another clue.

39:11.659 --> 39:14.573
Return address is
510 Hibiscus, Florida City.

39:15.156 --> 39:17.688
- Is that the brother's condo ?
- No, that's out near the glades.

39:17.814 --> 39:19.364
The other end of the spectrum.

39:27.870 --> 39:29.220
I knew I'd find you,

39:29.432 --> 39:31.082
just like I found everyone else.

39:31.742 --> 39:33.379
Saved you for last.

39:33.715 --> 39:35.706
You're the worst kid
I ever took care of.

39:35.832 --> 39:37.143
Wimpy Wally.

39:37.523 --> 39:38.535
Took care of ?!

39:38.985 --> 39:41.049
You locked me in a closet !

39:42.237 --> 39:43.137
Walter.

39:43.965 --> 39:45.265
Put the gun down, Walter.

39:45.484 --> 39:46.384
Get out !

39:46.595 --> 39:48.045
I can't do that now, Walter.

39:48.246 --> 39:50.450
Two against one, now.
Is that it ?

39:50.897 --> 39:53.247
You always needed someone
to stick up for you.

39:53.539 --> 39:54.731
I'll take you out myself.

39:54.857 --> 39:55.757
Go on.

39:55.932 --> 39:58.032
You're not man enough to kill me.

39:59.129 --> 40:00.029
Walter,

40:00.316 --> 40:01.456
put the gun down.

40:02.492 --> 40:04.180
- He ain't got the stomach.
- Shut up !

40:04.306 --> 40:05.406
You're pitiful.

40:05.510 --> 40:07.410
Boy's defective,
came to me that way.

40:07.653 --> 40:10.153
Walter, listen to me.
He is not worth it.

40:11.124 --> 40:12.024
Put it down.

40:16.427 --> 40:17.927
You were supposed to help me.

40:21.847 --> 40:22.747
Whoa.

40:23.140 --> 40:24.640
Hold it right there, old man.

40:25.951 --> 40:26.851
Don't move.

40:27.148 --> 40:28.621
Go ahead, you finish him off.

40:28.747 --> 40:30.947
You already did that
a long time ago.

40:31.811 --> 40:33.431
Real man doesn't need help.

40:33.556 --> 40:34.556
And a real man

40:35.075 --> 40:36.555
doesn't beat his kids, either.

40:37.583 --> 40:39.150
You know, without that gun,
you're just a little

40:39.255 --> 40:40.485
punk like him.

40:45.665 --> 40:46.565
Okay.

40:49.901 --> 40:51.251
Here's what I'm going to do for you.

40:52.787 --> 40:53.687
I am...

40:55.174 --> 40:56.174
going to let you...

40:58.283 --> 40:59.783
take you best shot at me.

41:01.608 --> 41:02.508
Okay, Morris ?

41:06.895 --> 41:07.795
Take your shot.

41:13.037 --> 41:13.937
Go ahead.

41:24.060 --> 41:25.510
That's what I thought.

41:29.043 --> 41:30.743
You can't do it, can you, Morris ?

41:31.844 --> 41:33.393
Not only are you a bully,

41:34.426 --> 41:35.776
but you're a coward.

41:38.631 --> 41:39.781
Lieutenant Caine, sir !

41:40.375 --> 41:42.482
Take him outside,
and call the paramedics.

41:42.608 --> 41:43.508
Yes, sir.

41:57.883 --> 41:59.183
Hang on a second, please.

42:03.906 --> 42:05.365
I envy you.

42:05.684 --> 42:08.030
You envy me ?
What for, Walter ?

42:08.267 --> 42:09.835
You see an old man.

42:11.399 --> 42:12.787
I see a monster.

42:14.914 --> 42:16.114
Is that why you needed my help ?

42:16.239 --> 42:17.949
Because you couldn't
face him yourself ?

42:19.994 --> 42:20.894
Jennifer.

42:21.305 --> 42:24.075
- Tell Jennifer...
- I am going to tell Jennifer

42:24.200 --> 42:26.254
that you will never be heard from

42:26.799 --> 42:27.999
or seen again.

42:28.470 --> 42:29.370
Take him, please.

42:40.167 --> 42:41.367
He did target me.

42:43.075 --> 42:45.882
- I can't believe I was so stupid.
- Jennifer...

42:47.258 --> 42:48.158
not stupid.

42:48.553 --> 42:49.453
Vulnerable.

42:50.278 --> 42:52.128
How did he know
that you'd find him ?

42:54.975 --> 42:55.875
Well...

42:56.264 --> 42:57.614
I guess I always have.

42:58.867 --> 43:01.617
But how did he know that
you'd stand up to his father ?

43:03.024 --> 43:03.924
Walter and I...

43:06.994 --> 43:09.194
Walter and I have
similar family histories.

43:13.043 --> 43:14.443
Your childhood was violent ?

43:15.148 --> 43:16.048
It was.

43:18.363 --> 43:20.050
Your dad was like old man Yates ?

43:22.237 --> 43:23.137
He was.

43:27.587 --> 43:28.537
Do you forgive me,

43:29.197 --> 43:30.297
for doubting you ?

43:32.817 --> 43:33.717
Already done.
