- Hey, buddy.
How are ya?

00:04.254 --> 00:05.213
Are you...

00:08.258 --> 00:09.759
Ahh, ahh, ahh!

00:09.843 --> 00:10.802
<i>Ahh!</i>

00:10.885 --> 00:12.220
- Wait, Daniel?

00:12.303 --> 00:13.263
- Run!

00:13.346 --> 00:14.097
Kangaroo!

00:14.180 --> 00:17.392
- Wait, I'm adopting him?

00:17.475 --> 00:17.934
Oh!

00:18.017 --> 00:18.643
What are you--

00:18.727 --> 00:21.688
Daniel!
What--

00:21.771 --> 00:23.898
[all screaming]

00:29.028 --> 00:30.071
- What are you doing?

00:30.155 --> 00:31.448
- There's a kangaroo
out there!

00:31.531 --> 00:32.531
- A kangaroo?
In school?

00:32.615 --> 00:33.533
Impossible.

00:33.616 --> 00:35.493
- I love kangaroos!

00:35.577 --> 00:38.621
- Kangaroo, good.

00:38.705 --> 00:40.790
- No, Phillip,
only pizza, okay?

00:40.874 --> 00:41.833
Got it?

00:41.916 --> 00:43.710
- Maybe it...
ran away from the zoo.

00:43.793 --> 00:45.628
- And you let him in?

00:45.712 --> 00:47.255
- What?
No.

00:47.338 --> 00:47.964
- Move, move!

00:48.047 --> 00:50.842
- No!
Francisco!

00:50.925 --> 00:51.801
You can't go out there.

00:51.885 --> 00:54.220
It could be dangerous.

00:54.304 --> 00:56.973
- I am the principal.
I have to.

00:57.056 --> 00:59.267
Please let go of me.

00:59.350 --> 01:00.810
- He's so brave.

01:00.894 --> 01:03.313
He's so principally.

01:03.396 --> 01:04.480
- Be careful, Dad!

01:10.653 --> 01:11.696
- It's confirmed.

01:11.780 --> 01:13.323
There's a kangaroo
loose in school.

01:13.406 --> 01:14.449
- Phillip hungry.

01:14.532 --> 01:15.742
- No!

01:15.825 --> 01:18.119
- I am so scared.

01:18.203 --> 01:20.497
I'm so scared!

01:20.580 --> 01:21.498
- Man, this is
the best week ever.

01:21.581 --> 01:23.917
I love it when
animals run wild.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.418
Remember that one time

01:25.502 --> 01:26.836
when there was a loose monkey
running around the school?

01:26.920 --> 01:28.463
And now a kanga--

01:28.546 --> 01:30.423
Uh-oh.

01:30.507 --> 01:31.424
[mouthing name]

01:31.508 --> 01:33.301
- You think?

01:33.384 --> 01:34.677
- No, Dad, wait!

01:34.761 --> 01:36.513
- Oh, this just got so good!

01:36.596 --> 01:37.847
EMMA: What if he's, uh...

01:37.931 --> 01:39.015
someone's pet?

01:39.098 --> 01:40.433
- I don't care
who he belongs to.

01:40.517 --> 01:42.393
I have to call
animal control.

02:20.723 --> 02:22.267
- You really think that kangaroo
could be a person?

02:22.350 --> 02:23.393
- Well, it makes
more sense than

02:23.476 --> 02:27.522
someone brought him
for show and tell.

02:27.605 --> 02:29.482
- This has Jax
written all over it.

02:29.566 --> 02:31.985
- No!
He wouldn't.

02:32.068 --> 02:33.361
- Kangaroos <i>are</i>
Australian.

02:33.444 --> 02:37.407
Wouldn't it be funny
if the kangaroo <i>is</i> Jax?

02:37.490 --> 02:38.491
- Phillip hungry.

02:38.575 --> 02:40.785
Kangaroo.

02:40.869 --> 02:43.371
- No, Phillip, kangaroos
are not food.

02:43.454 --> 02:45.748
We need to get him
some pizza ASAP.

02:45.832 --> 02:47.500
- Animal control is
on the way.

02:47.584 --> 02:48.209
- [sniffing]

02:50.420 --> 02:52.714
- Attention,
students and faculty,

02:52.797 --> 02:54.591
may I have your attention?

02:54.674 --> 02:57.135
<i>We have</i>
<i>an emergency situation.</i>

02:57.218 --> 03:00.346
<i>A wild animal</i>
<i>has entered the school.</i>

03:00.430 --> 03:03.057
- Everyone stay calm.

03:03.141 --> 03:04.601
URSULA:
<i>But don't worry!</i>

03:04.684 --> 03:05.894
<i>Your fearless leader</i>
<i>Principal Alonso</i>

03:05.977 --> 03:08.354
<i>has it all under control.</i>

03:08.438 --> 03:11.274
- Was that
Mrs. Van Pelt?

03:11.357 --> 03:13.484
- That, or Principal Alonso

03:13.568 --> 03:16.404
does a killer Mrs. Van Pelt
impression.

03:16.487 --> 03:18.573
<i>URSULA: Good call not telling</i>
<i>everyone it's a kangaroo.</i>

03:18.656 --> 03:19.782
<i>[feedback]</i>
<i>That could cause pandemonium.</i>

03:19.866 --> 03:21.868
<i>FRANCISCO:</i>
<i>Ursula, the mic is still on!</i>

03:21.951 --> 03:23.494
<i>URSULA: Oops!</i>

03:23.578 --> 03:25.330
- Kangaroo?

03:25.413 --> 03:27.081
- A kangaroo?

03:27.165 --> 03:28.666
I wanna go see!

03:28.750 --> 03:30.126
- No, kangaroos
are cute, but...

03:30.209 --> 03:32.545
they can be mean
if they want to be.

03:32.629 --> 03:33.922
- But you know what
my number-one

03:34.005 --> 03:37.967
all-time dream activity is.

03:38.051 --> 03:39.510
- Riding in
a kangaroo's pocket.

03:39.594 --> 03:41.346
- [squeals]
BOTH: No, no, no!

03:41.429 --> 03:43.264
- No running!

03:43.348 --> 03:44.557
- And I thought my last school
was dysfunctional.

03:44.641 --> 03:48.728
- We're not dysfunctional,
we're...unique.

03:48.811 --> 03:50.355
- Why do you keep
defending these lame humans

03:50.438 --> 03:52.732
and even lamer witches
you hang around with?

03:52.815 --> 03:54.525
- You can't talk about
my friends that way.

03:54.609 --> 03:56.903
- See?
You are <i>betrego.</i>

03:56.986 --> 03:58.237
Turning your back
on your tribe.

03:58.321 --> 03:59.656
- I'm not a traitor.

03:59.739 --> 04:03.159
I'm proud to be a Kanay,
but my friends are my tribe.

04:03.242 --> 04:05.828
They stick by me
no matter what.

04:05.912 --> 04:08.998
- Proxy, there you are.

04:09.082 --> 04:10.333
Did you hear about
the announcement?

04:10.416 --> 04:13.378
I was so worried the kangaroo
was gonna get you.

04:13.461 --> 04:15.505
- He's just fine.

04:15.588 --> 04:17.005
- What are you doing here?

04:17.089 --> 04:20.677
- Just having a little chat,
Kanay to Kanay.

04:20.760 --> 04:23.972
Or in this case,
Kanay to kinda sorta Kanay.

04:24.055 --> 04:27.767
- Look, Mia, I'm sorry about
what happened to your family.

04:27.850 --> 04:30.186
But not all witches are
like the principal.

04:30.269 --> 04:32.897
- Spoken like a Kanay who's
under a sneaky witch's spell.

04:32.981 --> 04:35.858
- [gasps]
How dare you?

04:35.942 --> 04:36.985
Our relationship is real.

04:37.068 --> 04:39.988
There is no spell.

04:40.071 --> 04:42.407
- Spoken like a sneaky witch
who's trying to trick a Kanay.

04:42.490 --> 04:43.700
- [gasps]
- Mia, that's it.

04:43.783 --> 04:47.203
You can insult me,
but you cannot insult Maddie.

04:47.286 --> 04:49.038
- You're a lost cause.

04:49.122 --> 04:51.666
And there's only one thing
to do with a lost cause Kanay.

04:55.795 --> 04:58.798
- What was that?

04:58.881 --> 05:00.550
- The Kanay duel dance.
[scoffs]

05:00.633 --> 05:02.719
You seriously need to brush up
on your Kanay history.

05:02.802 --> 05:05.888
- Duel? I don't wanna duel you.
- Too bad.

05:05.972 --> 05:07.849
Once the gauntlet is thrown,
you can't back out.

05:07.932 --> 05:11.144
- It sounds like she's making
this stuff up on the flu.

05:11.227 --> 05:13.396
- It's "on the fly."

05:13.479 --> 05:13.896
Ugh!

05:13.980 --> 05:16.524
Seriously.

05:16.607 --> 05:17.817
You could do a lot better.

05:17.900 --> 05:18.401
- [gasps]
- All right, that's it.

05:25.700 --> 05:27.660
You want a duel?
You got one.

05:27.744 --> 05:30.246
- Yeah.
Take that.

05:30.329 --> 05:30.747
- Great, let's go.

05:30.830 --> 05:32.749
- Right now?

05:32.832 --> 05:34.584
- No better time
than the present.

05:34.667 --> 05:36.669
- Uh...Hmm.
Let me check.

05:37.754 --> 05:40.757
Uh, I have
a social science quiz next.

05:40.840 --> 05:41.507
- And I have
history class.

05:41.591 --> 05:44.385
- Okay, after school then.

05:44.469 --> 05:46.846
- Uh, mm, I have a shift at
The Seven.

05:46.929 --> 05:48.222
- Mani-pedi.

05:48.306 --> 05:49.682
- This is not how
we set up a duel.

05:49.766 --> 05:53.811
- How about, um,
Monday, after school?

05:53.895 --> 05:54.562
- Monday works for me.
Mia?

05:59.025 --> 06:00.318
- Me too.

06:00.401 --> 06:01.319
- Great.

06:01.402 --> 06:02.862
It's settled, then.

06:02.945 --> 06:05.198
Prepare to be defeated.

06:06.407 --> 06:09.410
- Wait.
What happens to the loser?

06:09.494 --> 06:11.537
- The loser--
<i>[shouting and gasping]</i>

06:13.331 --> 06:16.876
- The loser what?
- Mia!

06:17.710 --> 06:19.629
- Give me
the memory card.

06:21.172 --> 06:22.799
This is it.

06:22.882 --> 06:26.052
We're gonna see who
flooded my studio.

06:29.097 --> 06:31.891
- Well?
- It's loading.

06:31.974 --> 06:33.309
It's loading and...

06:33.392 --> 06:35.269
[computer beeping]
No! No!

06:35.353 --> 06:36.854
The memory card's
going haywire!

06:36.938 --> 06:38.147
- Take it out!

06:38.231 --> 06:40.817
- Joey!
Joey, are you in here?

06:40.900 --> 06:42.235
- No, what are you doing?

06:42.318 --> 06:42.902
- Looking for the kangaroo
that's on the loose.

06:42.985 --> 06:45.530
- What kangaroo?

06:45.613 --> 06:48.157
- Didn't you hear Principal
Alonso's public announcement?

06:48.241 --> 06:49.867
- I've got to get
this on camera.

06:51.119 --> 06:52.120
- The kangaroo has a name?

06:52.203 --> 06:55.289
- In Sophie's head it does.

06:58.543 --> 07:01.671
- This is Miss Information
with a breaking news update.

07:01.754 --> 07:04.006
I have located the kangaroo

07:04.090 --> 07:06.300
that's been on the loose
through Iridium High.

07:12.390 --> 07:13.933
- What's going on out there?

07:15.226 --> 07:18.396
I clearly said to evacuate
in an orderly fashion.

07:18.479 --> 07:19.647
- Well, what do
you expect when

07:19.730 --> 07:20.940
you announce to a school
full of teenagers

07:21.023 --> 07:23.985
that there's a kangaroo
roaming around out there?

07:24.068 --> 07:25.570
- When <i>I</i> announce it?

07:28.614 --> 07:30.199
Okay, slow down.

07:30.283 --> 07:31.200
- We have to get
the kangaroo out of school

07:31.284 --> 07:32.785
before animal control
gets to it.

07:32.869 --> 07:34.537
- But there's no way your dad
will let us go after it.

07:34.620 --> 07:36.038
- You can
tele-transport it.

07:36.122 --> 07:37.874
- You know what happens
every time I transport anything.

07:37.957 --> 07:40.793
Splash.

07:40.877 --> 07:42.128
- Apple...

07:42.211 --> 07:44.046
All done.

07:44.130 --> 07:44.589
Still hungry.

07:49.051 --> 07:50.678
- You know that fruit's
fake, right?

07:50.761 --> 07:52.680
- Phillip doesn't know
the difference.

07:52.763 --> 07:54.849
- Okay, kids,
let's go.

07:54.932 --> 07:55.558
- I've got to get to it.

07:55.641 --> 07:57.518
I'm the chosen one.

07:57.602 --> 07:58.644
It's my duty.

08:02.231 --> 08:03.900
- Em, where are
you going?

08:03.983 --> 08:06.152
I'm just gonna go
make sure everyone,

08:06.235 --> 08:08.571
including the kangaroo,
is okay.

08:08.654 --> 08:09.530
- No!

08:09.614 --> 08:10.907
We wait for
animal control.

08:10.990 --> 08:12.783
You don't have any
experience with this.

08:12.867 --> 08:15.077
- I can handle it.
- I'll go with you.

08:15.161 --> 08:16.829
- We'll be okay,
Dad, I promise.

08:16.913 --> 08:18.372
- No!

08:18.456 --> 08:19.999
- Maybe you should
let them go.

08:20.082 --> 08:22.126
Then you and I can have
a lovely picnic in your office.

08:22.210 --> 08:24.921
- Have fun, bye!
- Wait!

08:26.005 --> 08:27.215
- Ooh!

08:29.133 --> 08:31.052
- Sorry, Dad!
Be back soon!

08:31.135 --> 08:32.845
Make sure nobody sees
him 'til I get back.

08:37.515 --> 08:39.936
- Everyone, out of
the building now!

08:40.019 --> 08:43.188
- Come on.

08:43.272 --> 08:44.440
GIGI: Witnesses say
the kangaroo

08:44.524 --> 08:46.817
stopped in the cafeteria
and ate from the salad bar.

08:46.901 --> 08:48.027
And then--
- Gigi!

08:48.110 --> 08:49.654
- I'm in the middle
of a livestream.

08:49.737 --> 08:50.446
- Sorry, but do you know
where the kangaroo went?

08:50.529 --> 08:52.156
- Yeah, it was just here.

08:52.240 --> 08:53.032
- Which way did it go?

08:53.115 --> 08:54.450
- Nurse Lily
led it that way.

08:54.533 --> 08:56.702
- Nurse Lily?
Oh, thank goodness.

08:56.786 --> 08:59.205
- Now, do you mind?

08:59.288 --> 09:00.456
Take two.

09:00.539 --> 09:02.625
Witnesses say the kangaroo
stopped in the cafeteria

09:02.708 --> 09:05.461
and ate from the salad bar
and then it hopped...

09:07.296 --> 09:08.798
- [gasps]
There you are.

09:08.881 --> 09:11.801
You are supposed to be in your
office for our council meeting.

09:11.884 --> 09:15.930
- Well, I was a little busy,
chasing after your kangaroo.

09:16.013 --> 09:17.890
- [laughing]

09:17.974 --> 09:21.686
Having a little fun on
the run, are we, Mr. Novoa?

09:21.769 --> 09:23.020
- Look, I got him as far
as the cafeteria, okay,

09:23.104 --> 09:26.816
but then he smelled all the food
and now he won't leave.

09:26.899 --> 09:28.025
Okay, you should
have changed him back

09:28.109 --> 09:29.277
like you said
you would.

09:29.360 --> 09:31.445
- Not until he's
learned his lesson.

09:31.529 --> 09:33.531
Have you, hmm?

09:33.614 --> 09:34.824
See?
He hasn't.

09:34.907 --> 09:37.410
In which case,
we must up the ante.

09:37.493 --> 09:38.577
- Stop!

09:42.123 --> 09:43.416
- Let me guess.

09:43.499 --> 09:45.418
That kangaroo
is actually a person.

09:45.501 --> 09:46.586
- [chuckles]
Perhaps.

09:46.669 --> 09:48.754
- [sighs] It's Jax.
- What?

09:48.838 --> 09:51.841
- He defied the council
one too many times

09:51.924 --> 09:53.926
and needed
to learn a lesson.

09:54.010 --> 09:55.052
- Change him back
right now!

09:55.136 --> 09:57.847
- How dare you speak
to me in that tone?

09:57.930 --> 10:00.725
- How dare you turn Jax into a
kangaroo and let him run loose?

10:00.808 --> 10:02.351
He could have been
captured by animal control

10:02.435 --> 10:03.311
and sent to the zoo.

10:03.394 --> 10:06.522
- Oh, don't be
so dramatic.

10:06.605 --> 10:08.065
- Aggy, it's been
long enough, okay?

10:08.149 --> 10:09.692
Jax has learned
his lesson.

10:09.775 --> 10:10.109
- Change him back.

10:10.192 --> 10:11.986
Now!

10:12.069 --> 10:13.195
- I can't.

10:13.279 --> 10:15.823
Since both Desdemona
and I cast the spell,

10:15.906 --> 10:17.366
we need to reverse
it together.

10:17.450 --> 10:19.285
- Fine,
then I'll do it.

10:19.368 --> 10:21.537
AGAMEMNON: [laughing]

10:21.620 --> 10:23.289
You may be strong,
I'll grant you that.

10:23.372 --> 10:24.707
But not that strong.

10:24.790 --> 10:27.793
- I've got to
at least try.

10:27.877 --> 10:29.670
This transformation
spell I have to undo.

10:29.754 --> 10:32.381
Make Jax no longer
a kangaroo.

10:34.300 --> 10:35.176
- You see?

10:35.259 --> 10:36.802
It's no use.

10:36.886 --> 10:40.097
We'll have to wait for
Desdemona to return.

10:40.181 --> 10:41.724
- I'm sorry, Emma.

10:41.807 --> 10:44.268
But we'll make sure Jax
is safe until then.

10:44.352 --> 10:48.105
- Honestly, I worry about
where your priorities lie,

10:48.189 --> 10:49.940
Miss Alonso.

10:50.024 --> 10:52.651
The realm is under attack
from a rebel Kanay,

10:52.735 --> 10:56.697
and this is what you choose to
spend your time worrying about.

10:56.781 --> 10:59.492
- Of course I care
about the realm,

10:59.575 --> 11:01.243
but my family and friends
will always come first.

11:01.327 --> 11:02.953
- Well...

11:03.037 --> 11:05.748
That's a weakness
you'll have to work on.

11:05.831 --> 11:07.041
- No!

11:07.124 --> 11:08.668
That's a strength
I'll never give up.

11:14.382 --> 11:15.633
- Achoo!

11:18.344 --> 11:19.970
- Desdemona?

11:22.223 --> 11:24.266
- Is everyone gone?

11:24.350 --> 11:25.768
- Yeah.

11:25.851 --> 11:27.812
What are you
doing back here?

11:27.895 --> 11:31.148
- An enormous herd of students
came running through,

11:31.232 --> 11:33.901
so I had to hide.

11:33.984 --> 11:34.985
- Why?

11:35.069 --> 11:37.446
- An angry mob of humans?
[exhales]

11:37.530 --> 11:39.949
Brings back bad memories.

11:40.032 --> 11:40.324
- Ah.

11:40.408 --> 11:42.326
Got it.

11:42.410 --> 11:44.537
No need to worry,
it's just me and Phil...

11:44.620 --> 11:46.414
- Phil, who's Phil?

11:46.497 --> 11:47.832
- Uh, no one.

11:47.915 --> 11:50.543
No one.
It's just...

11:50.626 --> 11:52.253
My belt.

11:52.336 --> 11:54.797
- You name your belt?

11:54.880 --> 11:56.382
And you talk to it
like it's alive?

11:56.465 --> 11:58.384
- Yeah.
Lots of people do.

11:58.467 --> 11:59.468
- Humans.

11:59.552 --> 12:00.803
- Oh, whoa!

12:00.886 --> 12:02.805
I think I hear
another mob coming.

12:08.561 --> 12:10.187
- Not so fast!

12:17.319 --> 12:20.823
And who is this, hmm?

12:22.867 --> 12:25.453
- You are so
courageous, Proxy.

12:25.536 --> 12:27.663
- I don't know if that was
courageous or stupid.

12:27.746 --> 12:29.665
Mia is way more
advanced than I am.

12:29.748 --> 12:32.835
- I'll help you prepare
this weekend.

12:32.918 --> 12:33.878
What am I gonna wear?

12:33.961 --> 12:36.672
I've never been
to a duel before.

12:36.755 --> 12:38.174
- I just ran into Mia.

12:38.257 --> 12:39.842
She seemed really upset.

12:39.925 --> 12:41.635
She wanted me to
ask you what's wrong.

12:41.719 --> 12:42.845
- Me?
She's the one who, the...

12:45.514 --> 12:47.099
- Dude.
What was that?

12:47.183 --> 12:49.518
- Proxy defended my honor.

12:49.602 --> 12:51.145
And Mia challenged him
to a Kanay duel.

12:51.228 --> 12:53.355
- What?

12:53.439 --> 12:54.648
I thought you two
were bonding.

12:54.732 --> 12:55.441
- We were, until she started
insulting Maddie

12:55.524 --> 12:58.777
and all of my friends.

12:58.861 --> 12:59.987
- This is a nightmare.

13:00.070 --> 13:01.906
You can't--
[beeping]

13:05.117 --> 13:06.160
It's your mom.

13:06.243 --> 13:08.204
I gotta get back
to Mr. Alonso's office

13:08.287 --> 13:09.413
before he unfreezes.

13:09.497 --> 13:12.500
Talk about this later.

13:12.583 --> 13:13.626
- Wait!

13:13.709 --> 13:16.629
My mom's in school?

13:16.712 --> 13:16.921
Why?

13:18.881 --> 13:20.716
- Agamemnon,
we have a huge problem

13:20.799 --> 13:22.676
with your new friend Andi.

13:22.760 --> 13:24.595
- What about Andi?

13:24.678 --> 13:27.765
- Oh, good.
This involves you as well.

13:27.848 --> 13:30.935
You pulled a zombie
out of a video game!

13:31.018 --> 13:32.019
- You what?

13:32.102 --> 13:32.436
- Accidentally!

13:32.520 --> 13:34.563
Once!

13:34.647 --> 13:36.607
And I sent him back before
anything bad happened.

13:36.690 --> 13:39.193
- Except now he's back.

13:39.276 --> 13:41.612
And do you have
anything to say for that?

13:41.695 --> 13:43.030
- That wasn't me.

13:43.113 --> 13:44.698
That was...

13:44.782 --> 13:47.284
an anonymous magical being.

13:47.368 --> 13:49.912
[both whispering indistinctly]

13:49.995 --> 13:51.163
- Guys, guys, guys.

13:51.247 --> 13:52.081
Why don't we just talk
about this

13:52.164 --> 13:54.583
in a calm,
respectful manner?

13:54.667 --> 13:56.085
- You're out of control.
- Mm-hmm.

13:56.168 --> 13:58.921
- Unresponsive to our questions,
using magic willy-nilly,

13:59.004 --> 14:03.300
and putting the realm
at risk of exposure.

14:03.384 --> 14:04.593
- Guess not.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.470
- And a kangaroo
randomly running around

14:06.554 --> 14:08.931
wasn't risking
exposure of the realm?

14:09.014 --> 14:11.475
- Mm, she's got a point.

14:11.559 --> 14:13.852
Look, maybe we can
come to a compromise.

14:13.936 --> 14:16.772
Okay, how about if
we change kangaroo Jax back

14:16.855 --> 14:20.067
into regular Jax and then we'll
get rid of the zombie.

14:22.528 --> 14:24.071
- Fine.
- Fine.

14:24.154 --> 14:26.240
- Great.

14:26.323 --> 14:28.075
This council stuff's
not so hard.

14:30.369 --> 14:31.495
[chuckles]

14:31.579 --> 14:33.455
Um, Emma,
you should tell your dad

14:33.539 --> 14:36.083
that the kangaroo situation
has been taken care of.

14:36.166 --> 14:37.501
- My dad?
- Mm-hmm.

14:37.585 --> 14:38.085
- My dad!

14:41.839 --> 14:43.007
- When we get married,

14:43.090 --> 14:47.303
a Franciscula baby
would be adorable.

14:47.386 --> 14:50.556
[laughing]

14:50.639 --> 14:51.890
Oh.

14:51.974 --> 14:53.809
- Whoa, that was strange.

14:53.892 --> 14:57.396
I was just in the hallway
and now I'm in here.

14:57.479 --> 15:01.567
And Emma, she was in here.
Now she isn't.

15:01.650 --> 15:03.193
You.

15:03.277 --> 15:04.570
What did you do?

15:04.653 --> 15:05.654
- Nothing.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.197
Oh, no, no,
no, no...

15:07.281 --> 15:11.327
Something happened in here
that allowed her to run off,

15:11.410 --> 15:13.495
and also Andi and that pale boy
with the big eyes.

15:13.579 --> 15:14.955
- Phillip.

15:15.039 --> 15:18.375
Yeah, the son I adopted
out of the kindness

15:18.459 --> 15:20.669
of my big, big heart.

15:20.753 --> 15:21.670
- You can't put
anything over me.

15:21.754 --> 15:25.049
That means detention tomorrow.

15:25.132 --> 15:25.799
- Tomorrow's Saturday.

15:25.883 --> 15:27.760
- Hmm, that's right.

15:27.843 --> 15:30.721
Detention day
for the real bad kids.

15:30.804 --> 15:31.847
Prepare yourself,
Mr. Miller.

15:31.930 --> 15:33.807
Prepare yourself.

15:33.891 --> 15:35.768
Now it's time
to evacuate.

15:37.102 --> 15:39.313
- Thanks for
the warning, Emma.

15:43.901 --> 15:46.445
BOTH: This was a fruitful
punishment session.

15:46.528 --> 15:49.573
Change Jax back now.
He's learned his lesson.

15:52.618 --> 15:53.535
- Jax!

15:53.619 --> 15:54.828
Are you all right?

15:54.912 --> 15:57.039
- Yeah.
[chuckles]

15:57.122 --> 15:58.832
I just feel
a little woozy.

16:00.959 --> 16:05.005
- Yes, this is
all very touching.

16:05.089 --> 16:07.257
Now, back to
the business at hand.

16:07.341 --> 16:09.468
- I know.
I'll get rid of the zombie.

16:09.551 --> 16:11.428
- Good, because we need to get
that crystal back.

16:11.512 --> 16:15.057
- And we need the chosen one
focused only on this task.

16:15.140 --> 16:16.308
- They're right, Em.

16:16.392 --> 16:17.559
As long as the crystal's
out there,

16:17.643 --> 16:19.061
all witches
are in danger.

16:19.144 --> 16:21.647
- Don't worry, the zombie
will be gone in no time.

16:27.486 --> 16:30.322
- I can't believe
this memory card doesn't work!

16:30.406 --> 16:32.241
How am I gonna
fix this?

16:32.324 --> 16:34.910
- A fried memory card?
Just buy a new one.

16:34.993 --> 16:37.996
- I don't need a new one.
I need this one.

16:38.080 --> 16:39.790
It has all the footage from the
prank from the janitor's closet.

16:39.873 --> 16:41.166
- It does?
- Yes!

16:41.250 --> 16:44.503
And whoever did this owes me
a lot of equipment.

16:44.586 --> 16:47.089
- Maybe I can help.
- Doubtful.

16:47.172 --> 16:48.799
We need an expert.

16:48.882 --> 16:51.468
- Well, I may know someone.

16:51.552 --> 16:52.469
Never mind, it's too risky.

16:52.553 --> 16:55.264
- Tell me, please?

16:55.347 --> 16:58.642
- I know a super secret hacker
that lives in Miami

16:58.726 --> 17:01.478
and she goes
by the name Blackhawk

17:01.562 --> 17:02.980
and she can hack into anything.
- I'm in.

17:03.063 --> 17:05.398
- Great, I need the cardand--
- No way.

17:05.482 --> 17:08.609
Get me Blackhawk's info
and I'll deal directly with her.

17:08.694 --> 17:11.946
- It's not that simple.

17:12.030 --> 17:14.116
She likes to
stay private.

17:14.199 --> 17:14.782
How about I set up
a meeting?

17:14.867 --> 17:16.535
- You would do that?

17:16.617 --> 17:18.412
- Of course.

17:20.204 --> 17:22.124
- Wow, I can't believe you stood
up to the council like that.

17:22.207 --> 17:26.587
I am rubbing off on you
more than I thought.

17:26.670 --> 17:28.130
- That's not the end.

17:28.213 --> 17:29.965
The council said that they
turned the kangaroo

17:30.048 --> 17:33.635
back into Jax
as long as I promised

17:33.719 --> 17:34.595
to get rid of
the zombie.

17:34.678 --> 17:35.637
- What?

17:35.721 --> 17:38.390
You said no, right?

17:38.474 --> 17:39.641
- Well...

17:39.725 --> 17:40.976
- Emma, no!

17:41.059 --> 17:43.729
- We had to
get Jax back.

17:43.812 --> 17:46.106
It was the only way.

17:46.190 --> 17:47.232
- I don't believe this.

17:47.316 --> 17:48.150
- Good.

17:48.233 --> 17:49.651
You shouldn't.
- What?

17:49.735 --> 17:51.069
- I told the council that
I'd get rid of the zombie,

17:51.153 --> 17:54.323
but not that I'd
get rid of Phillip.

17:54.406 --> 17:55.824
- So that means...

17:55.908 --> 17:57.409
- We'll just have to make
Phillip not a zombie anymore.

17:57.493 --> 17:59.953
- Emma, that's amazing!

18:00.037 --> 18:01.121
I'm speechless.

18:01.205 --> 18:03.499
- Oh, man,
I got you so good.

18:03.582 --> 18:05.918
You <i>are</i> rubbing off on me
more than you thought.

18:06.001 --> 18:08.170
Hey, where is
Phillip right now?

18:08.253 --> 18:09.713
- Oh, at Jax's.

18:09.797 --> 18:10.672
His dad's away on business.

18:10.756 --> 18:12.132
- Nice.

18:12.216 --> 18:15.385
But it looks like we'll need to
find him a more permanent home.

18:16.970 --> 18:19.556
- Remember, Phillip,
if you see Gigi, you--

18:19.640 --> 18:20.808
Wait, you remember
Gigi, right?

18:20.891 --> 18:22.601
- Uh-uh.

18:22.684 --> 18:25.521
"This is Miss Information
with annoying useless news."

18:25.604 --> 18:27.689
Cameras, lights?

18:30.609 --> 18:33.570
- Ah, yes.

18:33.654 --> 18:35.072
Phillip no like.

18:35.155 --> 18:37.699
- You'll stay away.
- [grunts]

18:41.286 --> 18:42.538
- All right.

18:42.621 --> 18:46.750
Two extra large pizzas,
double cheese and anchovies.

18:46.834 --> 18:47.543
Zombie Boy can eat.

18:47.626 --> 18:48.669
- Two?

18:48.752 --> 18:50.921
- The other two to go

18:51.004 --> 18:52.297
'cause we're
getting ready to close.

18:52.381 --> 18:55.092
- Thank you, Diego Kanay.

18:55.175 --> 18:56.927
- [laughs]
You got it.

19:00.180 --> 19:03.058
- Jax, kangaroo.
[laughs]

19:03.141 --> 19:04.518
- Not anymore, pal.

19:04.601 --> 19:05.769
It was a fun ride, though.

19:07.980 --> 19:10.899
- [screaming]
Joey!

19:10.983 --> 19:12.317
Found you!

19:12.401 --> 19:14.236
Wait, where are you going?

19:14.319 --> 19:15.904
I just want a ride!

19:15.988 --> 19:17.447
Wait!

19:22.870 --> 19:24.872
- Finally, Mr. Novoa.

19:24.955 --> 19:27.291
I thought
you'd never get here.

19:27.374 --> 19:30.294
Now that you're a...
kangaroo,

19:30.377 --> 19:33.005
I'd like for us
to have a little conversation

19:33.088 --> 19:37.676
without your interrupting.

19:37.759 --> 19:41.138
Listen carefully,
Mr. Novoa.

19:41.221 --> 19:42.931
We're having a little problem
with the chosen one

19:43.015 --> 19:45.225
and we need your help.

19:49.146 --> 19:50.856
Oh, no.

19:50.939 --> 19:53.859
Oh, no, we need to
get out of here.

19:53.942 --> 19:55.110
Is that pizza sauce?

19:55.193 --> 19:58.864
- Mmm.
Pizza, good.

19:58.947 --> 20:00.741
Andi, awesome.

20:00.824 --> 20:02.284
- Yeah, yeah, come on,
we need to get out of here.

20:03.619 --> 20:05.454
- Psst.

20:05.537 --> 20:06.747
Psst!
- What?

20:06.830 --> 20:08.957
- Don't look at me.
Keep working.

20:09.041 --> 20:10.459
It's all set up.

20:10.542 --> 20:13.045
Blackhawk has agreed
to help you.

20:13.128 --> 20:13.921
- It's Andi, isn't it?
- No!

20:14.004 --> 20:14.963
- How do you know?

20:15.047 --> 20:16.882
Do you know who it is?

20:16.965 --> 20:17.925
- No.

20:18.008 --> 20:19.968
But it's not Andi.

20:20.052 --> 20:21.970
Just--there's no way
she's smarter than me.

20:22.054 --> 20:24.181
- Whatever you say.

20:24.264 --> 20:26.600
Are you gonna give me
the 4-1-1 or not?

20:26.683 --> 20:28.268
- Yes.

20:28.352 --> 20:29.686
But first, I need to make sure
you won't tell anyone.

20:29.770 --> 20:31.772
- Really?

20:31.855 --> 20:33.899
You want <i>me</i>
to keep a secret?

20:33.982 --> 20:35.484
- You're right.
I guess I was wrong.

20:35.567 --> 20:36.735
I don't know what
I was thinking.

20:36.818 --> 20:37.319
- I can't wait
to meet Blackhawk.

20:37.402 --> 20:39.112
- You can't.

20:39.196 --> 20:41.114
She likes to keep
her identity private.

20:41.198 --> 20:42.991
If she sees you at
the drop-off,

20:43.075 --> 20:44.242
she'll leave.

20:44.326 --> 20:44.868
- It's Andi.
I knew it.

20:44.952 --> 20:47.537
- It's not Andi!

20:47.621 --> 20:48.622
Good luck.

20:50.624 --> 20:53.085
- "Leave the memory card in
the alley outside The Seven

20:53.168 --> 20:56.672
"with this exact
amount of nuts.

20:56.755 --> 21:02.052
"50% almonds, 25% cashews,
15% macadamias

21:02.135 --> 21:04.304
and 10% peanuts--"
what?

21:06.598 --> 21:08.100
- Andi, what kind of
tea do you want?

21:08.183 --> 21:10.018
- Tea?
Wh--what are we?

21:10.102 --> 21:11.019
80 and getting
ready to play cards?

21:11.103 --> 21:13.480
- I'll take that
as a no.

21:13.563 --> 21:14.523
Ahh!

21:14.606 --> 21:15.691
- [groaning]

21:15.774 --> 21:17.359
- Hey, Phillip's here,
with the nanny.

21:17.442 --> 21:19.778
- Jax!
Don't do that.

21:19.861 --> 21:20.904
What if my dad
was here?

21:20.988 --> 21:22.197
- I'd freeze him.

21:22.280 --> 21:23.657
Erase his memory

21:23.740 --> 21:27.035
and possibly draw a moustache
on his face just for fun.

21:27.119 --> 21:28.745
- Use the front door
next time, okay?

21:28.829 --> 21:30.247
- Okay.

21:30.330 --> 21:32.416
Look, Em,
we need to talk.

21:32.499 --> 21:35.419
I had a conversation with
Agamemnon when I was a kangaroo.

21:35.502 --> 21:37.587
- [giggles]
Weirdest sentence ever.

21:37.671 --> 21:39.715
- Yeah, look,
it was very one-sided.

21:39.798 --> 21:40.882
- And?

21:40.966 --> 21:43.343
They're mad at me again?

21:43.427 --> 21:44.428
- I think they're planning
to overthrow you.
