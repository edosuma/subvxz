And now, it's time for a breakdown.

01:39.680 --> 01:41.808
Mmm, mmm, mmm, yeah...

01:42.000 --> 01:45.083
Man, I told you Robbie Wheirdicht
showers here during first period.

01:45.240 --> 01:47.971
Why doesn't he just shower at home
like a normal person?

01:48.520 --> 01:50.045
Look at him.

01:50.200 --> 01:52.043
Does anything about that
look normal to you?

01:53.720 --> 01:56.451
You know, he's actually
a pretty good dancer.

01:59.240 --> 02:01.368
I mean, fuck that guy is different!

02:04.360 --> 02:05.361
Let's wreck him.

02:05.800 --> 02:07.882
Hey, Weird Dick!

02:08.199 --> 02:09.201
Come on.

02:10.160 --> 02:11.810
Finally, young ladies and young gentlemen,

02:11.960 --> 02:15.851
it is my pleasure
to announce that the winner

02:16.000 --> 02:19.129
of the National High School
Student of the Year Award

02:19.320 --> 02:20.810
is none other than your very own

02:20.960 --> 02:22.849
two-time student body president,

02:23.000 --> 02:26.482
the captain of
Central High's All Valley track team,

02:26.640 --> 02:28.165
president of the drama club

02:28.320 --> 02:31.767
and the senior voted
"Most Likely to Succeed."

02:32.000 --> 02:34.480
I gotta tell you folks,
after 40 years as an educator,

02:34.640 --> 02:36.483
he is my favorite student.

02:37.160 --> 02:38.366
I wish he were my son

02:38.520 --> 02:40.682
if I were medically able to have children.

02:42.640 --> 02:45.291
He's everybody's
favorite all-around guy...

02:45.440 --> 02:47.329
Calvin "The Golden Jet" Joyner! Come on!

03:09.000 --> 03:12.527
Golden Jet! Golden Jet! Golden Jet!

03:13.360 --> 03:14.691
Oh, my goodness.

03:15.160 --> 03:17.527
Wow! Wow, guys.

03:17.680 --> 03:20.490
Hey! How about a hand
for Principal Kent, huh?

03:20.640 --> 03:21.687
Huh?

03:22.240 --> 03:24.720
Honestly, if my mom
was into white guys, it would be you.

03:24.880 --> 03:25.881
I know it would, okay?

03:28.520 --> 03:31.524
Well, as we all know,
this is our last assembly,

03:31.680 --> 03:34.763
which means this is the last time
in front of you guys

03:34.920 --> 03:37.321
that I'll be able to tell
the most beautiful girl in the world...

03:37.840 --> 03:39.888
I'm talking about you, Maggie Johnson,

03:40.040 --> 03:43.567
that I love you. I love you, baby. I do.

03:43.720 --> 03:45.563
I'm gonna put it in my pocket.

03:45.720 --> 03:47.324
I'll save it.

03:47.480 --> 03:48.481
Okay.

03:49.880 --> 03:52.087
All right, guys. We're seniors now.

03:52.720 --> 03:54.882
And once we get those diplomas,

03:55.040 --> 03:58.010
the decisions that we make after that
are all up to us.

03:58.520 --> 04:00.921
I don't know what path
life is gonna take me on.

04:01.080 --> 04:02.605
But I can promise you all this...

04:02.800 --> 04:04.450
That I, for one, will push myself

04:04.600 --> 04:06.489
at every stage, at every step.

04:06.680 --> 04:09.160
So, I got one question to ask.

04:09.480 --> 04:12.768
I got one question for
the graduating class of 1996

04:12.920 --> 04:14.206
and that's "Will you..."

04:15.240 --> 04:16.969
Check out my Weird Dick!

04:41.480 --> 04:44.290
Hey. Here, here, man.

04:45.440 --> 04:46.885
Thank you.

05:03.680 --> 05:05.967
Well, there's no coming back from that.

05:07.840 --> 05:08.966
Calvin Joyner, everybody,

05:09.160 --> 05:11.845
voted "Most Likely to Succeed."

05:12.040 --> 05:15.647
Golden Jet! Golden Jet! Golden Jet!

06:05.760 --> 06:07.285
Yo. Check it.

06:07.800 --> 06:09.290
Oh, come on, man.
I don't want to see that.

06:09.440 --> 06:10.441
Oh, no, no, it's my dick.

06:10.640 --> 06:12.290
I know what it is. I don't want to see it.

06:12.440 --> 06:13.601
Hilarious.

06:13.760 --> 06:15.250
No, I'm working on this new sexting app.

06:15.400 --> 06:16.481
It's kind of like Instagram, right?

06:16.640 --> 06:17.766
But, instead of filters,

06:17.920 --> 06:19.251
it just makes your junk look huge.

06:19.440 --> 06:21.329
Like, three to six inches bigger.

06:21.600 --> 06:24.080
It's called "Junk Mail." Clever, right?

06:24.320 --> 06:26.322
- No, and here's why...
- Sorry, hang on, one second.

06:26.640 --> 06:28.051
I'm just gonna...

06:28.840 --> 06:29.841
What are you doing?

06:33.680 --> 06:36.524
Okay, and send.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.445
Sorry, you were saying something boring.

06:38.760 --> 06:40.000
You just sent a dick pic.

06:40.160 --> 06:41.730
It's called dating, grandma. Look it up.

06:41.920 --> 06:44.002
Why are you all cranky-pants
this morning, huh?

06:44.160 --> 06:46.606
Oh. It's because Ethan got promoted
instead of you?

06:47.760 --> 06:48.886
Ethan got promoted?

06:49.120 --> 06:51.248
Youngest senior associate
in the history of the firm.

06:51.400 --> 06:53.004
Corner office, the whole deal.

06:53.160 --> 06:54.321
Didn't he used to be your assistant?

06:55.840 --> 06:57.968
Who cares? Hey, you should
come to lunch with us.

06:58.120 --> 06:59.565
We're gonna be celebrating his pro-mosh!

06:59.720 --> 07:01.688
It'll probably be good for you
to kiss the ring a bit.

07:02.280 --> 07:03.645
"Kiss the ring a bit"?

07:03.800 --> 07:05.848
Hey, you play your chessboard
however you like, okay?

07:06.440 --> 07:09.364
Me, lunch today?
I'm gonna French kiss that thing.

07:09.600 --> 07:10.840
Aah...

07:11.480 --> 07:14.290
I can't. I'm taking my wife
to lunch today, so...

07:14.440 --> 07:15.726
All right. Bummer for you.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.087
Right?

07:23.640 --> 07:25.130
Can you just get out of my face?

07:25.360 --> 07:26.805
# Blessed.

07:37.920 --> 07:40.321
To a guy I not only consider my coworker,

07:40.520 --> 07:41.885
but my personal friend.

07:42.160 --> 07:44.049
- To Ethan!
- Cheers!

07:46.680 --> 07:48.489
Do you wanna move tables?
I know this kind of sucks.

07:48.640 --> 07:50.369
No, no. It doesn't suck.

07:50.560 --> 07:51.846
Hey, if I wanted to get
one of those ice teas

07:52.000 --> 07:53.923
but I want most of it to be bourbon...
What is that called?

07:54.160 --> 07:57.881
Okay. How about we change the topic
to something a little more fun?

07:58.240 --> 07:59.810
Anything else, please.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.161
Oh, how about...

08:01.320 --> 08:03.402
This is the dress
that I'm thinking about wearing.

08:04.200 --> 08:05.201
Oh!

08:05.360 --> 08:08.125
Honey, I want every single girl
to be jealous tomorrow night.

08:08.600 --> 08:09.647
Oh.

08:09.960 --> 08:10.961
What?

08:11.120 --> 08:12.451
I just... I just don't want to go.

08:12.640 --> 08:14.563
Calvin, it's our 20-year
high school reunion.

08:14.760 --> 08:15.921
I'm not gonna go without you.

08:16.080 --> 08:18.208
We agreed we were going. I RSVP'd for us.

08:18.360 --> 08:21.011
I just changed my mind. That's all.

08:21.160 --> 08:22.525
Okay. I see.

08:22.680 --> 08:25.081
You're disappointed
about the promotion. I get it.

08:25.240 --> 08:27.242
This is not about the promotion.

08:27.440 --> 08:30.046
Okay, this has to do with me
not wanting to spend my Friday night

08:30.200 --> 08:31.884
answering the
"What are you doing now?" question.

08:32.039 --> 08:33.087
That's what I'll get all night.

08:33.320 --> 08:35.049
"Hey, Calvin, what are you doing now?"
"I'm an accountant."

08:35.240 --> 08:36.321
"An accountant? Really?

08:36.480 --> 08:37.845
"I thought you would be the governor, man.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.400
"Wait a minute. Didn't you get voted
'Most Likely to Succeed'?

08:40.559 --> 08:41.924
"I guess we missed that one."

08:42.120 --> 08:43.451
Is this why you've been
so weird and moody lately?

08:43.600 --> 08:44.965
'Cause you're freaking out
about the reunion?

08:45.120 --> 08:46.167
- No.
- And what's the matter

08:46.320 --> 08:47.890
with being an accountant?
You love your job.

08:48.040 --> 08:49.530
No, you love your job.

08:49.680 --> 08:51.250
I'm good at my job.
It's not the same thing.

08:51.400 --> 08:52.401
Honey, that's not fair.

08:52.560 --> 08:54.210
You're a partner at your firm.

08:54.360 --> 08:58.245
Instead, I work in a building with a giant,
inflatable gorilla out in front of it.

08:58.400 --> 09:00.209
Look, I don't want to be
the guy that peaked in high school

09:00.360 --> 09:02.328
and, after he peaked,
his life went like this...

09:05.080 --> 09:06.650
I don't know the sound
that that thing makes,

09:06.840 --> 09:07.841
but you know what I'm trying to do.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.161
I'm the guy that went down, okay?

09:09.360 --> 09:10.407
- Yeah.
- Then my life

09:10.560 --> 09:11.846
down here became a disappointment.

09:12.080 --> 09:13.286
That's what I'll be.

09:13.440 --> 09:14.441
Wow.

09:15.520 --> 09:16.521
What?

09:16.680 --> 09:20.560
I had no idea that your life with me was
such a soundless, crashing disappointment!

09:20.720 --> 09:22.370
Don't do that.

09:22.520 --> 09:24.443
- That's not... Don't do that.
- That's the sound.

09:24.600 --> 09:26.125
You want to know the sound
I'm about to make right now?

09:26.280 --> 09:27.361
The sound of me not going.

09:27.520 --> 09:28.931
That's the sound I'm making.

09:30.240 --> 09:31.241
I'm not going.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.241
Yeah.

09:44.160 --> 09:45.889
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

09:52.040 --> 09:53.041
No.

09:54.440 --> 09:56.169
Not going to that.

10:04.120 --> 10:05.281
Bob Stone?

10:15.640 --> 10:16.801
Okay.

10:27.240 --> 10:28.241
Hello?

10:28.440 --> 10:30.807
- Hey.
- Girl, you scared me.

10:31.080 --> 10:33.606
- I did?
- Yes. I thought that you were...

10:34.680 --> 10:36.648
I just... On the...

10:37.240 --> 10:39.971
Never mind. Hey, I'm glad you called.

10:40.160 --> 10:42.401
I'm sorry about lunch today.

10:43.200 --> 10:44.247
I'm an idiot, babe.

10:44.400 --> 10:46.050
I don't even know
what's going on with me right now.

10:46.200 --> 10:47.725
- I really don't.
- Yeah?

10:47.880 --> 10:49.882
Actually, honey,

10:50.080 --> 10:51.889
that's what I was calling
to talk to you about.

10:52.480 --> 10:55.529
Look, honey, I think that
we should see someone.

10:56.560 --> 10:59.564
What do you mean, "Someone"?
What do you mean?

10:59.760 --> 11:01.842
See someone, like a therapist.

11:02.200 --> 11:04.328
Honey, black people don't go to therapy.

11:05.160 --> 11:06.571
We go to barbershops.

11:06.720 --> 11:08.245
That's where we talk out our problems.

11:08.400 --> 11:10.721
Or we watch the movie Barbershop.
One or the other.

11:10.880 --> 11:12.450
Look, my parents were really unhappy

11:12.600 --> 11:14.523
for a long time before they got divorced.

11:14.680 --> 11:18.162
And maybe if they saw someone sooner,
they would still be married.

11:19.520 --> 11:21.090
I just want to nip this thing in the bud,
whatever it is.

11:21.440 --> 11:22.601
I don't want to end up like my parents.

11:24.240 --> 11:27.130
Wassup?

11:33.640 --> 11:35.847
Please, just do it for me, if not for you.

11:36.960 --> 11:38.121
All right. Uh...

11:38.960 --> 11:41.930
- When? When do you want to do it?
- Really?

11:42.440 --> 11:44.249
The doctor said
he could see us at 6:00 p.m.

11:44.920 --> 11:47.287
Um... 6:00 p.m., when? Tonight?

11:47.440 --> 11:49.283
Yeah. Yeah, is that a problem?

11:49.440 --> 11:53.365
Holy shit! Robbie Wheirdicht?

11:54.160 --> 11:56.891
Calvin, honey? Hello?

11:57.040 --> 11:58.485
Um, yeah.

11:58.640 --> 12:01.564
I can't. I already
made plans for tonight, baby.

12:01.720 --> 12:03.961
- Plans with who?
- With Bob Stone.

12:04.160 --> 12:06.162
Who's Bob Stone?
That sounds like a fake name.

12:06.320 --> 12:09.642
No, no. You remember
Robbie Wheirdicht, from high school?

12:09.800 --> 12:10.801
No.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.809
The guy who got beaten up
by Trisha Demarco at homecoming?

12:13.040 --> 12:14.087
No.

12:14.240 --> 12:16.561
The kid that tried to rap along to
Coolio's 1,2,3,4 at the talent show

12:16.720 --> 12:18.324
but then he kinda lost his way,
midway through

12:18.480 --> 12:20.130
so he just started bopping his head,
and he stood there?

12:20.280 --> 12:21.805
No. Nothing.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.162
The guy who got thrown out the gym,
butt-ass-naked, senior year?

12:24.320 --> 12:25.321
Oh, my God, yeah!

12:25.480 --> 12:27.130
Why wouldn't you start with that?

12:27.320 --> 12:28.890
Because I thought that was kind of mean.
I don't know.

12:29.240 --> 12:30.605
He never came back
to school after that, right?

12:30.760 --> 12:32.967
Like, not for finals
or graduation or anything.

12:33.160 --> 12:35.003
Didn't he join the military or something?

12:35.160 --> 12:39.607
I'm not sure. I don't know if he did or not,
but he changed his name to "Bob Stone"

12:39.760 --> 12:41.842
and apparently he's in town
for the high school reunion.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.048
He wants to go to dinner tonight,
and I kinda already said "yes."

12:44.240 --> 12:45.241
- Okay.
- If you want me to cancel,

12:45.400 --> 12:46.845
I will. You know?

12:47.000 --> 12:48.365
If that's what you want, I don't mind.

12:49.080 --> 12:51.162
Mmm-mmm. I mean,
it's a little weird, but whatever.

12:51.320 --> 12:53.687
I'll just see if the doctor
can fit us in tomorrow.

12:53.840 --> 12:55.968
- How about at lunch time?
- Okay. All right, fine.

12:56.120 --> 12:57.360
Okay, good. I love you.

12:57.520 --> 12:59.249
I love you, too, babe. I do.

13:04.920 --> 13:05.842
- Oh, my...
- What is that?

13:06.000 --> 13:07.809
- Okay.
- Calvin? Are you...

13:07.960 --> 13:08.961
Love you. Bye-bye.

13:12.080 --> 13:13.081
No!

13:13.600 --> 13:14.886
Stop, stop!

13:15.240 --> 13:16.446
Hey, man. I...

13:16.640 --> 13:18.688
Hey! What's up, guys?

13:19.200 --> 13:21.806
Congratulations on that promotion, man.

13:21.960 --> 13:22.961
It's quite the thing.

13:23.360 --> 13:25.966
Thank you.
Hey, that's not work appropriate.

13:26.280 --> 13:27.281
Yup.

13:27.440 --> 13:29.044
Not cool, man. Not cool.

13:32.560 --> 13:34.244
Hey, forward that to me.

13:45.760 --> 13:46.921
For real man, seriously?

13:47.080 --> 13:48.764
Yeah. Watch it, punk.

13:51.240 --> 13:52.651
Excuse you, too.

14:12.400 --> 14:13.401
My man!

14:13.560 --> 14:14.971
Back the fuck up!

14:15.800 --> 14:17.165
- Whoa!
- Back up, man!

14:17.440 --> 14:19.329
Fine. I'll give you these fists.

14:19.600 --> 14:20.726
I'll fist your ass.

14:21.040 --> 14:22.451
Calvin. It's me, Bob.

14:23.440 --> 14:25.442
What? Sorry, do I know you?

14:26.400 --> 14:27.401
Do you know...

14:27.560 --> 14:30.564
Robbie Wheirdicht from high school!

14:31.720 --> 14:33.404
Are you kidding? What?

14:33.880 --> 14:36.281
- Wait, you're Robbie Wheirdicht?
- Yeah!

14:37.040 --> 14:39.725
God, man, look at you!
You've lost, like, 200 pounds!

14:39.880 --> 14:41.484
I see you gained it back in muscle.

14:41.640 --> 14:43.244
Oh, my God! You look great!

14:43.520 --> 14:45.329
- No, you look great!
- Stop it.

14:45.480 --> 14:47.847
No, you haven't changed
since high school, dude!

14:48.120 --> 14:51.249
No, you're just sexy as dick right now.

14:51.400 --> 14:53.448
You don't look somebody
in the eyes and say that.

14:53.600 --> 14:54.647
Hey, let's get hammered.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.048
I got an early day at work,
so I'll probably...

14:57.200 --> 14:58.281
No, come on, I'm buying!

14:58.440 --> 14:59.441
Oh, shit.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.001
Mmm.

15:01.560 --> 15:04.040
I'm sorry, man. I am blown away right now.

15:04.400 --> 15:06.402
Dude, you used to be Fat Robbie.

15:06.640 --> 15:08.881
Look at you!
This is like a total transformation.

15:09.040 --> 15:10.690
You look like Hercules or somebody.

15:10.840 --> 15:12.205
What did you do? Come on, give it to me.

15:12.360 --> 15:14.328
- I didn't do much, really.
- Stop it.

15:14.840 --> 15:16.842
All right. I just did one thing.

15:17.160 --> 15:18.207
Come on, I need to know.

15:18.640 --> 15:20.847
I worked out six hours a day, every day,

15:21.000 --> 15:22.490
for the last 20 years straight.

15:24.120 --> 15:26.646
- I mean, anybody can do it, right?
- Yeah.

15:27.720 --> 15:31.566
Yeah. You know, I've gotten into hot yoga.

15:33.240 --> 15:34.651
I started doing some sessions.

15:34.800 --> 15:35.801
Uh-huh.

15:37.240 --> 15:38.480
Nice unicorn, man.

15:38.640 --> 15:40.847
Oh, yeah, I'm big-time into 'corns.

15:41.040 --> 15:42.166
So magical, right?

15:42.320 --> 15:44.527
You know, they're the most
lethal animal on the planet.

15:44.920 --> 15:45.921
Here you go.

15:46.080 --> 15:48.082
Guys, my name's Lexi.

15:48.240 --> 15:49.446
Just let me know if you need anything.

15:49.680 --> 15:50.841
Okay.

15:51.160 --> 15:54.369
I mean, like, anything at all.

15:54.800 --> 15:56.211
Okie-dokie.

15:56.920 --> 15:59.571
You're funny. Do you ever, like, Snapchat?

15:59.720 --> 16:02.371
- Oh, no. You know...
- I wasn't talking to you.

16:03.040 --> 16:04.041
No, no, no. I don't do that.

16:04.200 --> 16:06.726
I'm just catching up
with an old friend from high school.

16:07.440 --> 16:09.568
Aw. You're so sweet.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.411
I think unicorns are sexy, too.

16:14.880 --> 16:16.609
That must happen to you
all the time, right?

16:17.000 --> 16:18.081
Ah, nah.

16:18.600 --> 16:20.409
I mean, all that meaningless sex is just...

16:20.560 --> 16:22.210
It's not my bag anymore, CJ.

16:23.480 --> 16:25.721
No, now, I'm looking for
more of an emotional connection.

16:25.920 --> 16:27.001
The next woman I lay with,

16:27.160 --> 16:28.924
she's gonna be beautiful on the inside,

16:29.080 --> 16:30.764
just as much as she is on the outside.

16:31.640 --> 16:34.086
Hey, wait. Whatever happened to that
girl that you liked in high school?

16:34.360 --> 16:36.931
Oh, God, man. The "Doogie Howser" girl.

16:37.080 --> 16:38.923
She was 14, but somehow she was a senior.

16:39.080 --> 16:40.206
She wore a cape.

16:40.920 --> 16:43.161
- Darla McGuckian.
- Darla McGuckian.

16:43.320 --> 16:45.084
"Yucky Gucky."

16:45.360 --> 16:47.761
- Didn't she have a lazy eye or something?
- Two of 'em.

16:48.240 --> 16:49.127
Right.

16:49.320 --> 16:50.321
Hey, but listen,
I don't wanna talk about me.

16:50.480 --> 16:51.481
I wanna talk about you.

16:51.640 --> 16:52.926
I heard that
you and Maggie Johnson got hitched.

16:53.080 --> 16:54.605
Oh, yeah.

16:54.840 --> 16:56.569
Yeah, man, right after college.

16:56.720 --> 17:00.122
Wow! The prettiest girl in school,
and the coolest guy in school!

17:00.280 --> 17:01.281
Oh, man, I got lucky.

17:01.440 --> 17:02.771
I mean, you guys are like
a power couple, dude!

17:02.920 --> 17:04.444
- No, no.
- Yes!

17:04.599 --> 17:07.444
You're like Taylor Swift
and whoever she's dating right now.

17:07.599 --> 17:10.079
- Power.
- Uh, thanks!

17:10.280 --> 17:11.724
Yeah. You guys got kids?

17:11.920 --> 17:13.285
No. No kids yet.

17:13.440 --> 17:15.363
We planned on it after college,

17:15.520 --> 17:18.569
but Maggie went to law school,
I kept changing jobs.

17:18.760 --> 17:22.127
You know, having kids just
isn't in our cards right now.

17:22.280 --> 17:23.281
Not at this point, that's all.

17:23.440 --> 17:24.487
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

17:24.839 --> 17:28.127
I don't wanna talk about
me and Maggie and myself.

17:28.280 --> 17:29.691
What about you? What are you doing?

17:29.840 --> 17:31.444
I didn't even ask you, man.
What do you do for work?

17:32.120 --> 17:33.485
I'm a government contractor.

17:33.680 --> 17:36.331
Okay, that's cool.
Like, what, buildings and stuff?

17:37.240 --> 17:38.241
Yeah, sort of.

17:39.120 --> 17:40.326
But I kinda just got fired.

17:40.640 --> 17:42.608
- Oh, shit! I'm sorry, man.
- Oh, it's okay.

17:42.760 --> 17:45.445
Screw those guys, anyway.
They're way too corporate.

17:45.680 --> 17:48.490
'Cause dudes like me and you,
I mean, we're alpha dogs, right?

17:48.680 --> 17:50.523
I mean, we're pathfinders
and trailblazers.

17:50.680 --> 17:53.365
And we don't listen
to what anyone tells us, right?

17:54.840 --> 17:56.251
- Yeah, right.
- Yeah.

17:56.400 --> 18:00.849
I mean, come on, man,
I sorta path-find a little bit

18:01.000 --> 18:05.130
along certain preapproved parameters
that are given to me.

18:05.280 --> 18:08.682
I'm willing to path-find
but it's all about how it's set up.

18:08.840 --> 18:13.243
But within the box that I have, I go nuts.
You'll be surprised.

18:13.440 --> 18:14.646
I had a guy tell me the other day,

18:14.800 --> 18:17.644
"Hey, Calvin, you know,
I need those accounting numbers back

18:17.800 --> 18:19.211
"from, you know, the file."

18:19.400 --> 18:22.210
- I said, "Go fuck yourself, Jim."
- Yeah.

18:22.360 --> 18:25.603
I didn't say it
because I wasn't in my box,

18:26.360 --> 18:29.603
- but I thought about it.
- Exactly! Yeah! Yeah!

18:30.160 --> 18:31.650
I got an idea. Let's do shots!

18:31.800 --> 18:32.881
No!

18:33.040 --> 18:34.804
I'm sorry for saying it like that, but no.

18:34.960 --> 18:36.644
I haven't had shots
in almost 10 years, man.

18:36.840 --> 18:39.047
What? Come on, we have to!
We're celebrating!

18:40.040 --> 18:41.041
Celebrating what?

18:41.200 --> 18:43.362
Celebrating that I'm hanging
with the coolest kid in high school.

18:43.520 --> 18:45.363
- Stop it.
- Calvin Joyner!

18:45.840 --> 18:47.729
The Golden Jet.

18:48.960 --> 18:51.691
You got to be shitting me. Wow!

18:52.400 --> 18:54.129
I haven't... God!

18:54.720 --> 18:56.722
It's been forever since I heard that, man!

18:56.880 --> 18:57.881
- I'll do one.
- All right!

18:58.040 --> 18:59.041
- One shot.
- Shots!

18:59.240 --> 19:00.321
No. One shot.

19:00.480 --> 19:02.562
Just one, okay? Bob, it's been a while.

19:03.960 --> 19:05.007
Oh, shit! You remember this?

19:05.200 --> 19:06.725
This was the jammy-jam!

19:06.880 --> 19:08.882
What's that? Is that a fanny pack, Bob?

19:09.080 --> 19:10.570
Hell, yeah! Dude, you want one?

19:10.720 --> 19:12.085
No, it's okay.

19:12.240 --> 19:13.685
I got two at home. I'll hook you up.

19:13.880 --> 19:16.042
Leather pack for The Jet.

19:16.200 --> 19:17.247
Fanny!

19:17.400 --> 19:18.686
Shit.

19:19.320 --> 19:21.209
What the hell did I get myself into?

19:21.800 --> 19:23.370
Mmm. Mmm-mmm-mmm.

19:23.760 --> 19:26.411
Hey, sir, somebody's
actually sitting there.

19:26.600 --> 19:28.762
- Yeah, someone was.
- No! Hey, man!

19:29.080 --> 19:30.411
Hey, you don't see
the sweatshirt right here?

19:30.600 --> 19:32.648
- Man, somebody's sitting here.
- Move your meat, lose your seat.

19:33.200 --> 19:34.361
Dude, you don't
have to be a dick about it.

19:34.520 --> 19:35.601
Somebody's sitting in the chair.

19:36.040 --> 19:38.771
Bro, are you seriously
gonna go there, bro?

19:39.600 --> 19:41.568
'Cause there's only one way back, bro.

19:41.720 --> 19:43.848
Through intensive care, bro.

19:45.440 --> 19:47.761
Was that the last "bro"?
'Cause if it was, then I'll talk.

19:47.920 --> 19:49.206
That supposed to be funny?

19:49.440 --> 19:50.771
- Dude...
- You a comedian now?

19:51.040 --> 19:53.088
'Cause you don't look like
Dane Cook to me, bro.

19:53.240 --> 19:54.730
Hey, now!

19:55.520 --> 19:56.601
What's the rumpus?

19:56.840 --> 19:57.841
You know... There's no problem, man.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.082
Let's just go to another table.
Get your jacket. Let's go.

20:00.600 --> 20:02.523
- No, we're not gonna go anywhere.
- Listen to your pussy friend.

20:02.840 --> 20:05.241
Those gym muscles
aren't scaring anybody, pal.

20:05.400 --> 20:07.448
- Oh, these?
- Let's just go. It's okay.

20:07.640 --> 20:10.120
No, we're not gonna go.
This man insulted you.

20:10.280 --> 20:12.089
And we're not gonna leave
until he apologizes.

20:12.240 --> 20:14.288
- It's okay.
- Hey, we got a problem here?

20:14.480 --> 20:16.482
- No, no.
- Yeah, we got a big problem.

20:16.640 --> 20:19.325
Your friend, here,
really insulted my friend

20:19.480 --> 20:20.481
and he needs to apologize.

20:20.640 --> 20:21.641
I don't think he does.

20:21.800 --> 20:22.801
He doesn't.

20:22.960 --> 20:24.849
Oh, you know what, man?

20:25.000 --> 20:27.287
I think this whole situation's
getting a little out of control.

20:27.440 --> 20:28.601
I can fix this whole thing.

20:28.760 --> 20:31.127
I'll order some nachos. The "Explosions."

20:31.280 --> 20:33.647
It's got four cheeses!
Let's eat 'em together.

20:33.800 --> 20:34.847
You know what? You take them.

20:35.040 --> 20:36.041
Let's go.

20:36.200 --> 20:37.326
Nah. We're not going anywhere, Jet.

20:37.480 --> 20:38.970
This whole thing will be over in a jiff.

20:39.120 --> 20:40.645
Hey, how about this?

20:40.840 --> 20:43.320
Why don't you and your boyfriend
apologize to Big Rick here

20:43.480 --> 20:45.687
and then go jerk each other
in the parking lot?

20:46.160 --> 20:47.127
That's a lot...

20:47.280 --> 20:48.327
Yeah. You're right, CJ.

20:48.480 --> 20:51.131
That's a lot of homophobia
coming out of a very angry man.

20:51.440 --> 20:53.807
You need to go get that looked at
by a trained professional.

20:53.960 --> 20:56.167
But, since you have
escalated this whole scenario

20:56.320 --> 20:57.810
by bringing what I can only assume

20:57.960 --> 21:00.361
is an unlicensed firearm
into this public place,

21:00.520 --> 21:02.682
endangering the lives
of all these innocent people,

21:02.840 --> 21:05.650
I can no longer,
in good conscience, walk away

21:05.800 --> 21:07.529
and jerk anyone off in the parking lot.

21:07.680 --> 21:09.808
I'm afraid we ain't going anywhere.

21:09.960 --> 21:11.166
It's time for you to get out of here, pal.

21:11.360 --> 21:12.805
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

21:13.600 --> 21:15.443
There's four of us, tough guy.

21:16.200 --> 21:17.611
Yeah. I got that.

21:18.200 --> 21:20.961
All right. Before this whole thing goes down,
you should know one thing about me.

21:21.120 --> 21:22.121
What's that?

21:26.040 --> 21:27.530
I don't like bullies.

21:38.880 --> 21:40.041
Let's go, Jet.

21:41.120 --> 21:42.360
Yes.

21:43.840 --> 21:46.366
Oh, my God! I hope he's Catholic.

21:49.360 --> 21:50.885
Oh, my God!

21:51.080 --> 21:52.525
What the hell was that?

21:52.680 --> 21:54.569
Bob, that was amazing!
I've never seen anything like that!

21:54.720 --> 21:56.404
You took the one guy,
you hit him like this.

21:56.560 --> 21:57.721
He couldn't breathe.

21:57.920 --> 21:59.331
I sat there, I'm looking at him...

21:59.480 --> 22:00.720
You talkin' to him like,
"I don't like bullies."

22:00.920 --> 22:02.490
I was like, "That's not a good line."
But it was!

22:02.640 --> 22:03.641
I didn't even know you could fight!

22:03.840 --> 22:06.571
You had a unicorn shirt, a fanny pack,
and it totally worked!

22:06.760 --> 22:08.922
You were like Jason Bourne,
man, but with jorts!

22:09.080 --> 22:11.401
How did you do that?
Where'd you learn that stuff?

22:11.600 --> 22:13.409
I took a couple classes at work.

22:13.600 --> 22:14.931
I hope I didn't go too far.

22:15.080 --> 22:16.206
I'm sorry about ruining the night, Jet.

22:16.360 --> 22:19.250
Ruin my night?
No! It was the coolest thing ever, man!

22:19.440 --> 22:20.851
- Really?
- Yes!

22:21.000 --> 22:23.321
To see my boy go in and whoop ass
on those idiots back there.

22:23.480 --> 22:24.641
Dude, that was amazing!

22:24.880 --> 22:26.723
Wait, we're boys?

22:27.360 --> 22:28.441
Yeah, we boys.

22:30.080 --> 22:31.127
Wow. I...

22:33.000 --> 22:34.001
Never had a boy.

22:36.560 --> 22:38.847
- That's awesome! Come here!
- Oh, wait.

22:39.840 --> 22:41.524
Stop. What's going on, man?

22:41.680 --> 22:43.284
- I'm a hugger!
- What're you doing?

22:44.600 --> 22:47.729
Hey! I got an idea.
Let's roll. Here's my bike.

22:48.960 --> 22:50.041
Wait. That's your bike?

22:50.200 --> 22:51.929
Yeah. Kawasaki 800!

22:52.080 --> 22:53.525
I know what the bike is.

22:53.720 --> 22:55.404
I had the same bike in high school, man.

22:55.600 --> 22:57.204
- You still ride?
- No, man.

22:57.360 --> 22:58.361
I haven't ridden a bike in years!

22:58.560 --> 22:59.800
Come on, let's roll.

23:02.960 --> 23:04.485
Where? Where you trying to go?

23:04.800 --> 23:07.451
I know the perfect spot. Come on, Jet.

23:08.480 --> 23:09.970
You know, why not? Why not?

23:10.120 --> 23:12.327
After this... Yeah, okay!

23:12.720 --> 23:13.801
Let's roll.

23:15.840 --> 23:19.003
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hey, Bob! Slow, slow, slow!

23:19.480 --> 23:20.641
Bob, hey, hey!

23:26.800 --> 23:29.849
God, this is so crazy, man.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.729
This brings back so many memories.

23:33.040 --> 23:34.121
I don't know, CJ.

23:34.280 --> 23:35.850
I mean, high school
wasn't easy for me, man.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.685
I don't know if you know this,
but I didn't have many friends back then.

23:39.480 --> 23:40.481
What?

23:41.040 --> 23:42.690
- Really?
- No.

23:42.840 --> 23:43.887
I don't know why I thought...

23:44.040 --> 23:45.371
True story.

23:45.520 --> 23:48.364
Man, I thought high school
was gonna be like Sixteen Candles

23:48.520 --> 23:50.329
and I was gonna be like Molly Ringwald.

23:50.480 --> 23:52.971
Sure, things were difficult
in the beginning, but then, by the end,

23:53.160 --> 23:54.366
everything worked out.

23:54.520 --> 23:56.602
And Jake Ryan picked her up
in that red Porsche.

23:56.760 --> 23:57.841
What-what?

23:58.040 --> 23:59.041
You ever see that movie?

24:00.320 --> 24:02.368
I'm black, so I don't know the...

24:02.520 --> 24:04.204
You gotta see it, dude.

24:04.360 --> 24:07.364
Total classic.
It's my favorite all-time movie.

24:07.520 --> 24:10.649
Then I realized high school
was nothing like Sixteen Candles.

24:11.880 --> 24:13.723
And I'll never be like Molly Ringwald.

24:15.720 --> 24:17.484
Yeah, well, depends on who you ask.

24:17.680 --> 24:19.205
That's the thing. For me, I...

24:20.800 --> 24:21.881
What's going on?

24:23.080 --> 24:24.320
Oh, wow.

24:26.200 --> 24:27.804
Hey, man, I just wanna say that
I'm really sorry

24:27.960 --> 24:30.406
about what Trevor and those guys
did to you back then.

24:37.240 --> 24:40.050
No biggie. I don't even
think about it anymore. No.

24:40.680 --> 24:41.841
Okay, good.

24:42.080 --> 24:43.730
Yeah. Here's the secret.
You know what I did, Jet?

24:43.880 --> 24:46.326
I took all that stuff
and I balled it up real tight

24:46.480 --> 24:49.006
and then I shoved it way down deep.

24:49.520 --> 24:51.522
And I just pretty much ignore it.

24:51.960 --> 24:54.725
You know, that sounds
really unhealthy, Bob.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.240
Hey, I gotta tell you.

24:56.400 --> 24:58.050
You were the only one
who helped me out that day.

24:58.320 --> 24:59.890
In the gym? Remember that?

25:00.040 --> 25:02.407
And you gave me your letterman's jacket!

25:02.600 --> 25:05.649
Hey, not for nothing,
but I never got that jacket back, man.

25:06.080 --> 25:07.081
Huh!

25:07.320 --> 25:09.049
Really? Strange.

25:10.080 --> 25:12.561
Hey, but listen, I just wanna thank you
for what you did for me that day.

25:12.720 --> 25:14.006
That was really cool of you, Jet.

25:14.160 --> 25:16.083
Stop, man.
It was the right thing to do, you know?

25:17.800 --> 25:20.167
- You wanna hear something weird?
- What?

25:20.320 --> 25:22.049
I have not been naked since that day.

25:22.200 --> 25:23.531
I mean, not in front of anyone.

25:23.920 --> 25:25.001
Never.

25:25.160 --> 25:26.730
So, you're telling me
that for the last 20 years,

25:26.920 --> 25:28.763
you've never been seen
in your birthday suit?

25:28.960 --> 25:30.689
- No.
- So, what about when you have sex?

25:31.080 --> 25:33.242
I keep it pitch-black,
just like Vin Diesel.

25:33.800 --> 25:34.801
What?

25:36.240 --> 25:38.811
You know I've been wondering,
whatever happened to Trevor anyway?

25:38.960 --> 25:41.691
Did he get hit by a bus
or ripped apart by dogs

25:41.840 --> 25:43.888
or die slowly of anything?

25:44.080 --> 25:47.880
No. No, no.
He's a bigtime investment banker downtown.

25:48.480 --> 25:50.687
- Oh, hey, cool.
- Yeah.

25:50.840 --> 25:52.171
Good for him, man.

25:52.560 --> 25:55.086
Hey, Bob, look,
if you ever wanna talk, I'm here.

25:55.640 --> 25:57.210
So I don't mind, you know?

25:57.720 --> 25:58.767
I don't mind at all, if you wanna...

25:58.920 --> 25:59.921
What?

26:01.320 --> 26:03.084
Whoa.

26:03.800 --> 26:06.167
This is all our stuff from our year!

26:06.320 --> 26:09.164
Yeah. Must be getting ready
for the reunion tomorrow night.

26:09.320 --> 26:10.367
Come on, man. Let's get out of here.

26:10.520 --> 26:12.727
What? No! "Get out..."
Look, you're all over this!

26:12.920 --> 26:16.242
Look at this.
Basketball, baseball, cross country.

26:16.400 --> 26:17.640
Hamlet.

26:17.840 --> 26:18.841
Prom King.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.570
There's Darla McGuckian.

26:20.760 --> 26:22.649
Synchronized swimming, that's so sexy.

26:22.920 --> 26:25.366
This is like the Guinness Book
of Golden Jet Records right there.

26:26.720 --> 26:27.960
I see that.

26:29.240 --> 26:31.607
To be honest with you,
I don't even recognize this guy anymore.

26:32.280 --> 26:33.850
This guy, here, he was gonna...

26:34.000 --> 26:35.889
He was gonna conquer the world.

26:37.440 --> 26:39.044
If 18-year-old me could see me now,

26:39.240 --> 26:40.924
he'd probably think I was a total loser.

26:42.280 --> 26:44.123
What? That's crazy talk!

26:44.280 --> 26:45.805
- You're The Golden Jet, dude!
- Stop.

26:45.960 --> 26:48.804
Stop, Bob. Spare me
with The Golden Jet shit.

26:49.600 --> 26:51.682
I'm not The Golden Jet, man.
I'm an accountant.

26:51.880 --> 26:53.245
That's my reality.

26:56.280 --> 26:59.204
I just thought
I was meant for more, you know?

26:59.880 --> 27:01.882
My life would be something special.

27:03.800 --> 27:06.451
You know how they say every man
is the hero of his own story?

27:07.640 --> 27:08.721
Was that in Twilight?

27:09.360 --> 27:12.045
No, I don't think that's where it's from.

27:12.200 --> 27:14.248
But those books are cool, right? Vampires!

27:14.440 --> 27:16.442
And there's a wolf-boy.

27:16.600 --> 27:21.401
I'm not... I'm not talking
about Twilight, Bob, okay?

27:21.560 --> 27:22.721
I'm talking about the fact that
I don't feel like

27:22.880 --> 27:24.644
I'm the hero of my own story. That's...

27:24.800 --> 27:26.450
How are you not the hero
of your own story?

27:26.600 --> 27:28.045
No one else can be!

27:28.200 --> 27:29.964
Yo, CJ, I gotta be honest with you, man.

27:30.120 --> 27:31.645
I mean, all this talk about Calvin Joyner

27:31.800 --> 27:33.040
not feeling like he's a hero...

27:33.200 --> 27:34.725
That's crazy talk, man.

27:35.240 --> 27:36.844
No. No, it's not.

27:37.000 --> 27:38.570
You were the best thing about high school.

27:39.080 --> 27:40.411
I'll always believe in you.

27:40.560 --> 27:42.881
Yo, do you remember
those backflips you used to do?

27:43.680 --> 27:45.284
The crowd would go crazy!
I was there, too.

27:45.440 --> 27:47.442
I was, like, "What? How's he do that?"

27:47.640 --> 27:48.687
How did you do that?

27:50.560 --> 27:52.244
I don't know. I just did it, man.

27:52.760 --> 27:53.921
Exactly.

27:54.080 --> 27:55.081
So, do it now.

27:55.960 --> 27:58.884
No, no. You're crazy! No.

27:59.200 --> 28:00.281
What's that?

28:00.440 --> 28:01.487
What're you talking about? What's what?

28:01.640 --> 28:03.244
- Golden Jet!
- No, stop it.

28:03.400 --> 28:05.164
- Golden Jet!
- Okay, stop it!

28:05.320 --> 28:06.845
- Golden Jet!
- All right.

28:07.000 --> 28:08.331
Golden Jet!

28:08.480 --> 28:11.370
I'm not gonna stop until
you do The Golden Jet flip!

28:11.520 --> 28:12.521
Golden Jet!

28:12.680 --> 28:14.921
All right, everybody, settle down.
Settle down!

28:15.080 --> 28:17.606
If the crowd wants a Golden Jet flip,

28:17.760 --> 28:19.489
then they gonna get a Golden Jet flip.

28:19.640 --> 28:20.766
You go, girl!

28:23.560 --> 28:26.689
Oh, God!

28:26.840 --> 28:28.205
That was so close, Jet.

28:29.800 --> 28:30.801
Here, buddy. Come on.

28:32.000 --> 28:33.570
They must have just waxed these floors.

28:35.840 --> 28:37.604
That was definitely a first, man.

28:39.040 --> 28:40.485
Oh, man, I am beat.

28:41.040 --> 28:42.041
Oh.

28:44.040 --> 28:45.087
Hey, Jet!

28:45.360 --> 28:48.682
Man, I had a great time tonight.

28:48.840 --> 28:49.841
Whoa!

28:50.480 --> 28:52.482
You know what?
I had a good time, too, man.

28:52.640 --> 28:54.085
I feel like I needed this, you know?

28:54.240 --> 28:56.447
Yeah. Yeah. Me, too!

28:56.960 --> 28:57.961
Thank you.

28:58.160 --> 29:00.561
My pleasure, amigo. Any time.

29:00.720 --> 29:04.122
Hey, if there's ever anything
I can do for you, just say the word.

29:04.280 --> 29:06.806
Wow. You really mean that?

29:07.320 --> 29:08.367
Yeah.

29:08.520 --> 29:11.330
I wasn't gonna bring it up,
but I might as well.

29:11.520 --> 29:14.649
Lately, I've been having this problem
with my payroll account. And...

29:15.360 --> 29:16.521
It's all screwed up, somehow.

29:16.840 --> 29:20.083
You know, I was overseas
working for a while before I got fired.

29:20.240 --> 29:23.164
So, it's kinda like
a forensic international account thingy

29:23.360 --> 29:26.569
which, I think,
is kind of your specialty, right?

29:27.600 --> 29:28.601
Um...

29:29.000 --> 29:32.800
Yeah, no, it is.
I'll take a look at that for you.

29:33.000 --> 29:34.161
You would? You would do that for me?

29:34.320 --> 29:36.846
I've got the login info,
if you wanna crack open your computer,

29:37.040 --> 29:38.280
we can do this!

29:38.720 --> 29:40.290
Oh, you mean now?

29:40.440 --> 29:42.568
- That's awesome! Yeah!
- Okay.

29:42.720 --> 29:44.404
- Look at this!
- Hey, Bob...

29:44.560 --> 29:45.607
Whoa!

29:45.800 --> 29:47.006
Bob, you gotta keep your voice down!

29:47.160 --> 29:48.286
Maggie's sleeping.

29:49.440 --> 29:50.441
Wow.

29:51.080 --> 29:54.323
This is a pretty serious international
account dossier you've got here.

29:54.520 --> 29:57.649
Right? I just want to make sure
everything was hunky-dory.

30:02.000 --> 30:03.809
Going to your router.

30:03.960 --> 30:06.406
Now you're talking to me.

30:07.880 --> 30:09.962
Bingo. I'm in.

30:10.480 --> 30:12.767
Oh. That's great, Jet. Thank you, man!

30:16.480 --> 30:18.482
I mean, just looking at it first-hand,

30:18.640 --> 30:21.962
it kinda looks like it's a bunch of
off-shore escrow accounts.

30:22.120 --> 30:23.645
These have been backwashed into

30:23.840 --> 30:26.889
a series of domestic dummy accounts
for some reason.

30:27.040 --> 30:29.611
I mean, the logs are all crazy, too.
You have China,

30:30.400 --> 30:31.845
Syria, Iran.

30:33.320 --> 30:34.685
This is an auction site, Bob!

30:36.000 --> 30:37.604
These are bids. All of these.

30:37.760 --> 30:40.331
This is hundreds of millions
of dollars in bids, right here.

30:40.520 --> 30:43.411
And judging by this clock, here,
it says it's all gonna end tomorrow.

30:43.720 --> 30:44.767
Whoa!

30:44.920 --> 30:47.969
- What the hell? Why?
- What did...

30:48.120 --> 30:49.565
- Oh! I'm sorry, Jet!
- Bob!

30:49.720 --> 30:52.405
Jet, I'm so sorry! Oh, man.

30:52.560 --> 30:54.847
- I'm all thumbs.
- It's my computer!

30:55.040 --> 30:56.565
- I'm sorry.
- No! Please, Bob.

30:56.720 --> 30:57.926
- I'm sorry, Jet.
- Leave it. I got it.

30:58.120 --> 31:00.487
It's fine, Bob. It's fine. Just leave it.

31:00.640 --> 31:01.801
The worst!

31:02.080 --> 31:03.241
God!

31:03.640 --> 31:06.041
Hey! What the hell was that on that site?

31:06.200 --> 31:07.770
That didn't have
anything to do with payroll.

31:08.280 --> 31:10.282
I don't know. I've never seen that before.

31:10.440 --> 31:11.441
That was crazy.

31:11.640 --> 31:13.881
Let's figure it out tomorrow
when we're bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.

31:14.040 --> 31:16.361
What do you say, CJ? I am beat.

31:17.160 --> 31:18.525
Hey, do you mind if I crash here?

31:19.360 --> 31:20.646
Um...

31:21.720 --> 31:22.721
No.

31:24.240 --> 31:26.129
Let me go grab some blankets.

31:30.920 --> 31:33.241
Hey, thanks for the jammies, Jet.

31:34.520 --> 31:37.171
Okay, well, you can keep those.

31:37.320 --> 31:39.129
Those are... Those are officially yours.

31:40.560 --> 31:41.971
Yeah.

31:42.800 --> 31:44.609
- All right.
- Oh.

31:45.440 --> 31:46.930
You gonna sleep with your fanny pack.

31:47.080 --> 31:50.004
Golden Jet! Yeah, it's my baby.

32:01.600 --> 32:04.809
You need anything else? You're okay?

32:06.760 --> 32:10.162
I can't believe I'm having a sleepover
at Calvin Joyner's house right now.

32:10.360 --> 32:12.840
This is blowing my mind!

32:14.320 --> 32:15.321
Okay.

32:15.880 --> 32:16.881
Uh, good night, Bob.

32:17.880 --> 32:19.041
Good night, Jet.

32:38.800 --> 32:39.801
Me?

32:40.520 --> 32:41.726
Yeah, you.

32:47.400 --> 32:48.890
What the fuck?

32:51.760 --> 32:53.000
One second.

32:57.720 --> 32:58.926
Hold on.

33:03.400 --> 33:04.447
Uh, may I help you?

33:04.600 --> 33:06.125
Mr. Joyner, my name is Pamela Harris,

33:06.280 --> 33:08.567
I'm with the Central Intelligence Agency.

33:08.720 --> 33:11.087
Have you had any contact with this man?

33:11.680 --> 33:14.331
Uh, yeah, he's on my...
He's on my couch, sleeping.

33:14.480 --> 33:15.481
Target's in the house.

33:15.680 --> 33:17.887
What's going on? Hey!

33:18.040 --> 33:20.486
Excuse me. Excuse me!

33:24.200 --> 33:25.247
Target's fled.

33:25.920 --> 33:27.001
Shit.

33:27.240 --> 33:28.366
Target's on the move.

33:28.520 --> 33:29.601
Excuse me! What...

33:33.800 --> 33:35.609
Hello, hey! Excuse me!

33:35.800 --> 33:37.848
- ...and voice chatter in the vicinity.
- Hello! Excuse me!

33:38.000 --> 33:40.241
If he's in the wind again,
it's gonna be your ass. Go now.

33:40.400 --> 33:42.562
- Hello!
- Alert Langley, asset uncontained.

33:42.720 --> 33:43.926
Excuse me!

33:44.960 --> 33:45.882
- Can I help you?
- Hello!

33:46.080 --> 33:47.320
It's my house. Is something going on?

33:47.480 --> 33:49.926
Well, Mr. Joyner, your sleepover buddy,
Robert Wheirdicht,

33:50.080 --> 33:53.562
AKA Bob Stone, AKA Bob Golden,
AKA Bob Jet,

33:53.840 --> 33:55.729
is wanted for murder and treason

33:55.880 --> 33:58.531
and is presently in possession
of highly classified state secrets

33:58.720 --> 34:00.404
which he intends to sell to our enemies.

34:00.600 --> 34:01.647
What?

34:01.800 --> 34:05.600
And if he succeeds, it's gonna spark
a chain reaction of geopolitical events

34:05.760 --> 34:06.921
that most of our predictive models

34:07.080 --> 34:09.844
place somewhere between
World War III and outright Armageddon.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.321
So, yeah, I guess you could say
something is going on.

34:12.719 --> 34:13.721
Oh, you mind?

34:15.440 --> 34:18.011
Creamer's in the fridge. What?

34:18.199 --> 34:19.690
I don't need it.

34:19.840 --> 34:21.728
What I do need is information.

34:21.880 --> 34:24.724
I need you to tell me
everything and anything

34:24.880 --> 34:26.643
about your contact with Agent Stone.

34:27.520 --> 34:30.126
- Agent Stone?
- Bob, your friend Bob.

34:30.280 --> 34:32.089
Come on. Stay with me, please.

34:33.159 --> 34:35.322
Okay, I think there's a misunderstanding.

34:35.480 --> 34:37.641
No. No, he is not my friend.

34:37.840 --> 34:40.761
Then why did he list you as his emergency
contact in all his personnel forms?

34:41.040 --> 34:42.121
I'm sorry... He what?

34:42.280 --> 34:44.806
Bob Stone has no siblings, or parents,
or family of any kind.

34:45.120 --> 34:48.607
You are the only person he listed
in his personal references.

34:48.800 --> 34:50.040
Oh...

34:50.199 --> 34:52.646
That's crazy, all right?
I barely even know the guy.

34:52.800 --> 34:54.085
Then why was he sleeping on your couch?

34:54.239 --> 34:55.446
Because we went out
and had drinks last night.

34:55.600 --> 34:57.250
Oh, so you went out drinking
with your non-friend?

34:58.440 --> 34:59.441
Okay.

35:00.040 --> 35:01.451
All right, let's... You're not...

35:01.920 --> 35:02.967
Time out.

35:03.160 --> 35:04.571
I'm pressing the time out button.

35:04.720 --> 35:08.167
Okay? You guys barged in my house.
I pay my taxes.

35:08.440 --> 35:11.603
So you're not gonna come here
and treat me like I'm the enemy, okay?

35:11.760 --> 35:13.888
That's the first thing.
Now, if you want to get into facts...

35:14.160 --> 35:15.650
You wanna talk about facts?

35:15.840 --> 35:16.841
This is Facebook's fault.

35:17.000 --> 35:18.001
Are you familiar with Facebook?

35:18.160 --> 35:19.207
We surveil it.

35:19.360 --> 35:20.930
He sent me a friend request.

35:21.080 --> 35:22.525
That's how this whole thing started.

35:22.720 --> 35:23.801
And you accepted?

35:24.520 --> 35:26.249
Don't do that. Don't do that to me.

35:26.400 --> 35:29.768
You give me a second. Okay?
Don't fire back like that.

35:29.920 --> 35:32.048
First of all,
fuck Mark Zuckerberg, all right?

35:32.200 --> 35:34.567
Now, I accepted because it was Facebook.

35:34.720 --> 35:37.206
And it's rude when you don't accept it and I
don't know if the person on the other end

35:37.400 --> 35:39.721
can see me not accept it.
That's why I accepted.

35:39.880 --> 35:41.370
Are you nervous, Mr. Joyner?

35:41.680 --> 35:42.727
Is it hot?

35:42.880 --> 35:44.769
Are you getting hot?
Because I'm getting hot.

35:44.920 --> 35:46.251
I'm not gonna take off my jacket

35:46.400 --> 35:48.050
because that makes me look guilty.

35:48.200 --> 35:50.601
And that's what you guys look for. Hmm?

35:51.000 --> 35:53.367
Is this what a guilty man would do?

35:53.600 --> 35:55.921
Look how comfortable I am.

35:56.560 --> 35:59.086
I'm gonna lean up against this counter,
and I'm not gonna sweat.

35:59.800 --> 36:03.566
I'm not gonna...
I'm not gonna look flustered at all.

36:03.760 --> 36:05.603
I'm... Bring it.

36:06.040 --> 36:07.246
What you want to know?

36:07.560 --> 36:08.607
Hmm?

36:08.760 --> 36:09.921
- Mr. Joyner.
- Yeah.

36:10.080 --> 36:11.923
Bob Stone is a dangerous psychotic.

36:12.240 --> 36:14.242
- You're lucky to be alive.
- Okay, listen to me.

36:14.440 --> 36:17.250
Agent Harris, I don't know this man.

36:17.520 --> 36:19.090
He's just a little weird kid
that I knew in high school.

36:19.280 --> 36:20.805
He used to put Rice Krispies Treats
in my locker.

36:20.960 --> 36:22.291
Sometimes I ate 'em, sometimes I didn't.

36:22.440 --> 36:26.009
I wasn't in carbs back then 'cause I
didn't want that weight going to my hips.

36:26.200 --> 36:28.441
As a man, you don't want big hips,
especially in high school.

36:28.760 --> 36:31.081
Bottom line,
I have no allegiance to this man.

36:31.240 --> 36:32.810
Zero ties, okay?

36:33.000 --> 36:34.161
All ties are cut.

36:34.320 --> 36:36.288
I cut them, so this is me and you.

36:36.760 --> 36:38.444
So don't put me and him...

36:38.840 --> 36:41.002
I ain't in this shit, okay?

36:41.800 --> 36:44.087
All right, Mr. Joyner. Prove it.

36:44.960 --> 36:46.564
Yeah, well, I need a second.

36:46.760 --> 36:49.240
You gotta step outside.
I gotta take a shit.

36:49.400 --> 36:50.606
This is a lot.

36:50.760 --> 36:53.081
I got to go. Just give me a second, man!

36:53.880 --> 36:55.848
- I'll be waiting.
- Jesus Christ!

37:06.200 --> 37:08.965
All teams be advised,
we're Oscar Mike with the bait.

37:09.160 --> 37:10.605
I'm sorry, did you just
call me "the bait"?

37:10.760 --> 37:11.807
No.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.047
Yeah, you did.
She just called me the bait.

37:13.200 --> 37:14.201
Why am I the bait?

37:14.360 --> 37:15.850
No, that doesn't sound like
something I'd ever say.

37:16.040 --> 37:18.202
- You just said it.
- What's going on here?

37:18.360 --> 37:20.010
Sir, I'm gonna need you to step aside.

37:20.160 --> 37:22.322
This is a matter of national security.

37:22.600 --> 37:23.840
Yeah, right! I love it.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.367
What is this? Like a strippergram thing
to suck up to Ethan?

37:26.520 --> 37:28.010
Gotta love strippers. So dirty.

37:28.160 --> 37:30.128
Show us your tits! Show us your tits!

37:30.280 --> 37:33.011
Hey, let's see some titty!

37:36.040 --> 37:38.168
- This you?
- Yeah, right here.

37:38.320 --> 37:39.845
You did this to yourself.

37:45.200 --> 37:47.521
- Small.
- Yeah.

37:54.680 --> 37:55.681
It's my wife.

37:56.560 --> 37:59.211
Mr. Joyner, it is my legal obligation
to inform you

37:59.360 --> 38:02.091
that you are now a part of
a highly classified covert action.

38:02.240 --> 38:04.481
So, say hello to your wife
and then get off the phone.

38:04.640 --> 38:05.846
Am I clear?

38:06.000 --> 38:07.525
Don't tell my wife shit. Got it.

38:08.360 --> 38:09.486
Don't tell your wife shit.

38:10.880 --> 38:12.484
- What line?
- Line one.

38:14.720 --> 38:16.688
Hey, Mags.
Hey, I can't really talk right now, babe.

38:16.840 --> 38:19.684
- I got a lot going on.
- Okay, okay. I get it. You're hungover.

38:19.840 --> 38:21.763
Listen, Dr. Dan can see us today at lunch.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.526
- Wait a minute, Dr. Dan?
- The therapist, remember?

38:24.680 --> 38:27.968
So, I'm thinking we should just
meet at home and go together. Thank you.

38:28.120 --> 38:31.329
Go. Go on,
and I'll just see you there, okay?

38:31.480 --> 38:32.606
But I got to really go, babe.

38:32.760 --> 38:34.364
I'm slammed in here.
So, I gotta get off the phone.

38:34.520 --> 38:37.091
- All right. Jeez! Is everything okay?
- Everything is fine, babe.

38:37.240 --> 38:39.641
I gotta keep the line clear.
I love you. Bye, I gotta go.

38:41.000 --> 38:42.161
Love you. Bye.

38:42.720 --> 38:43.721
Hmm.

38:44.440 --> 38:45.487
"Hmm." What?

38:45.640 --> 38:48.450
I'm an expert in speech pathology
and psycho-lingual subtext.

38:48.600 --> 38:50.762
Your wife is not fulfilled
in your relationship.

38:51.000 --> 38:52.001
Wait, what?

38:52.360 --> 38:53.771
Also, she wants to have a baby.

38:54.320 --> 38:55.526
Where are you getting...

38:59.200 --> 39:00.725
Calvin Joyner, Accounting.

39:03.400 --> 39:05.562
Hello? Calvin Joyner, Accounting.

39:06.320 --> 39:07.321
Calvin?

39:10.680 --> 39:12.762
It's Bob! It's Bob!

39:12.920 --> 39:14.160
Act natural.

39:14.320 --> 39:16.448
Calvin. Is that you?

39:16.600 --> 39:17.761
Are you there?

39:18.480 --> 39:20.687
Well, hey. Well, yeah.

39:21.600 --> 39:23.443
Yeah, wassup?

39:24.280 --> 39:26.851
What up, Bobby-o?

39:27.000 --> 39:29.207
Are you quite well?

39:29.360 --> 39:30.441
I'm in big trouble.

39:30.600 --> 39:32.887
Oh, God! I screwed up.
I screwed up big time.

39:33.040 --> 39:35.168
We gotta talk. Can you meet me?

39:35.320 --> 39:37.527
Sure. Yeah. Where?
Where do you want me to meet you?

39:37.680 --> 39:39.250
I'm in the stairwell of your building,
two flights down.

39:40.080 --> 39:41.286
- Stairwell?
- Hurry!

39:42.720 --> 39:44.768
- He's in the stairwell, two flights down!
- Move, move!

39:44.920 --> 39:46.001
Alert Charlie team.

39:46.240 --> 39:48.163
Hold on. What's going on? Am I safe here?

39:48.360 --> 39:50.089
As long as Bob Stone
is in the building, no one's safe.

39:50.280 --> 39:52.169
Get back in your office now!

39:56.760 --> 39:57.966
Okay!

39:58.160 --> 40:00.208
Good news is we heard her, guys.

40:00.480 --> 40:03.370
So, everybody, let's all just stay calm.

40:03.520 --> 40:05.966
As long as... As long... Shit!

40:09.000 --> 40:10.968
What the hell is going on?

40:11.120 --> 40:12.281
- Relax.
- Hey.

40:12.440 --> 40:14.124
Great job at
getting them out of here, Jet.

40:14.280 --> 40:15.441
- Oh, Bob!
- That's teamwork!

40:15.800 --> 40:17.370
Wait! How did you... What did you just do?

40:17.560 --> 40:18.766
It's a tradecraft, buddy.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.286
Spoiler alert...

40:20.480 --> 40:21.606
I'm in the CIA.

40:21.760 --> 40:22.841
Oh, no shit!

40:23.000 --> 40:24.240
Hey, hey! What're you doing with my phone?

40:24.440 --> 40:26.169
You about to turn my phone
into a bomb, aren't you?

40:26.480 --> 40:28.528
I've seen Homeland.
So I know what they do.

40:28.800 --> 40:31.326
Homeland? No, I'm ordering us an Uber.

40:31.480 --> 40:33.323
Six minutes. That's kinda tight.

40:34.200 --> 40:35.804
I'm gonna need your tie.

40:36.400 --> 40:37.526
You're gonna... No!

40:37.680 --> 40:38.886
- Your necktie, take it off.
- No,

40:39.080 --> 40:40.605
- I'm not taking my tie off!
- Come on, Jet!

40:40.760 --> 40:42.285
Don't do that. Don't do that.

40:42.440 --> 40:43.566
That's good. Save it, save it, save it.

40:43.720 --> 40:45.085
Save it, Jet.

40:45.240 --> 40:47.083
- There we go, just right over here.
- Fine, take it, take it.

40:47.240 --> 40:50.005
You can have it. Okay, that...
Listen to me. Listen.

40:50.160 --> 40:51.207
Stop. Stop!

40:51.360 --> 40:53.362
I need to know
what is happening, right now.

40:53.520 --> 40:55.522
Okay, okay. You know what?
Moving too fast.

40:55.720 --> 40:58.883
Bottom line, are you in or you out?

40:59.680 --> 41:00.886
What are you... In or out of what?

41:01.040 --> 41:03.520
Mmm-mmm. No time
for questions, just action.

41:03.680 --> 41:05.762
- In or out?
- Okay, then I'm out.

41:06.400 --> 41:08.402
I'm sorry, Jet.
Actually, you're already in.

41:08.560 --> 41:10.005
Then why would you ask me?

41:10.160 --> 41:11.969
Because I thought
you would go, "I'm in, Bob!"

41:12.120 --> 41:14.971
And we would've had a really cool moment,
but you kinda ruined the whole thing.

41:15.120 --> 41:16.167
I ruined...

41:16.320 --> 41:17.401
Okay, okay, okay.

41:17.560 --> 41:18.971
Listen to me right now.

41:19.160 --> 41:22.325
Bob, I don't know what it is that
you're into but what I do know is that

41:22.480 --> 41:26.371
I am really, really 100% out!

41:26.520 --> 41:27.521
Do you understand that?

41:27.680 --> 41:29.967
- God, you are good!
- What?

41:30.120 --> 41:32.930
Calvin Joyner, president of the Drama Club
for a reason, folks!

41:33.080 --> 41:35.811
- You're like a snack-size Denzel.
- Okay. Stop it, stop it, stop it.

41:36.800 --> 41:38.211
This is not a game.

41:38.360 --> 41:39.885
I'm being serious right now.

41:40.560 --> 41:41.561
I'm out!

41:44.120 --> 41:45.326
Okay. Okay.

41:45.520 --> 41:47.602
I can't say I'm not disappointed, Jet,

41:48.440 --> 41:49.726
but if you're out, you're out.

41:49.880 --> 41:51.769
Thank you! I'm out!

41:51.920 --> 41:53.888
I'm just happy that we can communicate

41:54.040 --> 41:55.690
openly and honestly.

41:55.840 --> 41:58.810
I think it says a lot
about our relationship.

41:58.960 --> 42:01.327
Wait, hold up, wait.
What're you doing? Oh, my God!

42:01.480 --> 42:02.527
Here's the thing, though.

42:02.680 --> 42:04.205
There's only one way for you to get out.

42:04.360 --> 42:05.486
What's that?

42:05.640 --> 42:06.846
You gotta get in first.

42:07.040 --> 42:08.371
What is it that...

42:08.520 --> 42:09.806
What-what! Take my gun, Jet,

42:10.000 --> 42:11.525
we may have to kill some people.

42:11.680 --> 42:13.842
- Come on, it's not gonna bite you.
- I will do no such thing.

42:14.000 --> 42:15.001
I think you'll like it.

42:15.160 --> 42:16.491
- I will not!
- You're gonna need it.

42:17.440 --> 42:19.920
You're gonna need it! He's in here!

42:20.120 --> 42:21.121
Jet.

42:21.280 --> 42:23.851
He's in there! Bob's in there!

42:24.000 --> 42:26.287
He's got a gun! He's got a gun!

42:28.480 --> 42:30.164
- Down, down, get down!
- Move, move, move!

42:30.920 --> 42:32.001
All right. I'm gonna need
your improv skills.

42:32.160 --> 42:33.161
What?

42:33.360 --> 42:35.806
- Hostage role-play, you ready?
- No!

42:36.040 --> 42:37.610
- Sweet, let's go.
- No, I said no!

42:37.760 --> 42:38.921
I said no!

42:39.080 --> 42:40.525
He's got a hostage!

42:41.560 --> 42:42.561
No!

42:42.720 --> 42:44.563
No! Stop it, you gonna get me killed!

42:46.160 --> 42:47.321
Don't shoot!

42:59.960 --> 43:00.961
There we go, Jet!

43:01.760 --> 43:02.761
What are you doing?

43:02.920 --> 43:04.001
Oh! Shoot!

43:05.840 --> 43:06.841
Don't shoot!

43:18.760 --> 43:21.001
- Hang tight, Jet!
- No, I'm not doing anything!

43:21.200 --> 43:22.690
Stop including me in your stuff!

43:24.600 --> 43:26.250
Get him, Agent! Hit him with the stick!

43:31.240 --> 43:32.287
Oh!

43:32.600 --> 43:34.602
You're doing a great job, Jet.
Just give me a second, okay?

43:34.760 --> 43:35.807
What the fuck?

43:36.840 --> 43:37.841
He got a coffee pot!

43:55.560 --> 43:56.561
He got a banana!

44:01.520 --> 44:03.045
Oh! Oh!

44:04.040 --> 44:05.246
Freeze!

44:16.560 --> 44:18.289
Jet, help!

44:18.480 --> 44:19.481
What?

44:20.480 --> 44:22.687
Golden Jet, help.

44:22.840 --> 44:23.966
No, man, I'm not helping you!

44:27.000 --> 44:28.001
Oh, shit.

44:28.560 --> 44:29.846
- Give me the gun!
- Stop it!

44:30.000 --> 44:31.331
- Stop resisting!
- No, let me go!

44:35.080 --> 44:37.082
Let me go! I'm trying to give it to you!

44:40.120 --> 44:41.406
Oh, shit!

44:41.560 --> 44:42.766
- That was an accident!
- Don't move!

44:42.920 --> 44:44.206
No, stop! Listen to me!

44:46.840 --> 44:47.921
Let's go.

44:48.680 --> 44:50.091
Wait, wait! Come on! What are you... Ah!

44:50.800 --> 44:52.040
Come on, man!

44:52.200 --> 44:54.168
This has gotta stop! Okay?

44:56.080 --> 44:57.127
Shit!

45:01.600 --> 45:02.886
Don't shoot!

45:03.960 --> 45:05.803
- Oh, God!
- Show us your hands!

45:05.960 --> 45:07.405
- Drop your weapon!
- Do it now!

45:16.080 --> 45:17.081
Ow.

45:17.880 --> 45:18.881
Sorry, Jet.

45:19.040 --> 45:21.122
It's over, Bob. Give up.

45:21.320 --> 45:22.890
You know I can't do that, Pam.

45:23.040 --> 45:24.883
There's nowhere to run, Agent Stone.

45:25.520 --> 45:26.726
Just like Caracas.

45:27.360 --> 45:31.251
Uh, Caracas would've worked
if you trusted me like Calvin trusts me.

45:31.400 --> 45:32.561
No. No.

45:32.720 --> 45:34.484
That is not true. I do not trust him!

45:34.640 --> 45:36.722
I do not trust him at all.
As a matter of fact,

45:36.920 --> 45:38.285
this is a perfect time
for us to clear this up

45:38.440 --> 45:40.442
especially in the middle of this standoff.
I shouldn't be here!

45:40.600 --> 45:43.171
So I feel like me being
in the middle of this throws me in it.

45:43.320 --> 45:44.651
So let me exclude myself.

45:44.840 --> 45:46.524
- Hey, stay down!
- Don't move!

45:46.720 --> 45:49.371
Okay, all right.
I'll stay in. I'll stay in.

45:50.640 --> 45:51.607
I got a plan.

45:52.360 --> 45:55.370
Might get us both killed but if it works,
it'll be a totally boss story.

45:55.560 --> 45:56.561
Cool?

45:56.720 --> 45:58.688
- No! No, it's not cool!
- Cool.

45:58.840 --> 46:00.001
No, I said it's not cool.

46:00.160 --> 46:01.685
I said it's not cool!

46:01.840 --> 46:03.001
Time's up.

46:03.680 --> 46:04.841
You're right, Pam.

46:05.560 --> 46:06.641
My time is up.

46:06.800 --> 46:08.848
In three, two,

46:09.680 --> 46:10.681
one.

46:18.360 --> 46:20.408
Bob, Bob, Bob!

46:20.960 --> 46:23.406
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

46:24.040 --> 46:25.246
Oh, shit!

46:26.000 --> 46:27.001
Whoo-hoo!

46:43.920 --> 46:45.729
Wow! Did you feel that, Jet?

46:45.880 --> 46:48.121
That was the balls right there!

46:50.160 --> 46:51.446
Hey, did you shit yourself a little bit?

46:53.520 --> 46:55.727
It's all right if you did. Totally cool.
I don't judge.

47:01.200 --> 47:02.201
Get it off!

47:02.600 --> 47:03.681
You guys order an Uber?

47:06.400 --> 47:07.561
What are you doing?

47:08.320 --> 47:09.685
You better get your tuches in the car.

47:09.840 --> 47:10.841
You're gonna get shot!

47:11.000 --> 47:12.161
Don't shoot me! Shoot him!

47:12.320 --> 47:14.846
Shoot him! I'm out! I'm out! I'm out!

47:15.000 --> 47:17.241
Let me in! Let me in! Let me in! Go, Bob!

47:21.720 --> 47:23.085
Hey, that's my car!

47:23.760 --> 47:24.761
Fuck you!

47:25.240 --> 47:26.969
You get zero stars!

47:28.000 --> 47:30.207
Put the word out to all assets.

47:30.360 --> 47:31.930
I'm doubling the price on Bob's head.

47:32.360 --> 47:33.930
Hey, what the shit, honey...

47:35.520 --> 47:36.885
Get Larry on it.

47:42.200 --> 47:43.247
Car, car, car!

47:43.880 --> 47:45.609
All right, here's the dilly-o, Jet.

47:45.760 --> 47:47.410
About three weeks ago,
an enemy of the state

47:47.560 --> 47:48.800
codenamed "The Black Badger"

47:48.960 --> 47:51.930
stole the encryption keys
to the entire US spy satellite program

47:52.080 --> 47:55.124
which he's gonna sell to a buyer from that
auction site on your computer last night.

47:55.280 --> 47:56.327
Bob...

47:56.480 --> 47:57.561
If we lose control of our satellites,

47:57.720 --> 48:00.530
we're completely vulnerable
to any terrorist attacks.

48:00.680 --> 48:02.603
That's why I had to go back
to your office and get you, Jet.

48:02.760 --> 48:04.524
I need your super sweet accounting skills

48:04.680 --> 48:06.603
to help me figure out
the last piece of this puzzle

48:06.760 --> 48:09.001
which is the transaction number
from the winning bid.

48:09.160 --> 48:11.049
That'll tell us
where the deal is going down.

48:12.920 --> 48:15.048
That way, we can get The Black Badger.

48:15.400 --> 48:16.401
I can't do it without you, Jet.

48:16.920 --> 48:19.127
Are you kidding me? I'm not helping you.

48:19.280 --> 48:21.044
You attacked somebody with a banana.

48:21.200 --> 48:23.931
- A banana, force multiplier.
- What?

48:24.080 --> 48:26.162
Well, basically what that means
is anything in your hand

48:26.320 --> 48:30.161
is far more dangerous than just your
bare hands alone, including a banana.

48:30.800 --> 48:31.801
Oh!

48:32.960 --> 48:35.008
Oh! Ah!

48:35.280 --> 48:36.850
- A force multiplier!
- Yeah.

48:37.000 --> 48:38.490
Yeah, that's what it is.

48:38.680 --> 48:40.682
It makes so much more sense to me now.

48:40.840 --> 48:43.047
That's page-one CIA stuff.

48:43.200 --> 48:46.602
I almost forgot
that I wasn't in the fucking CIA!

48:47.560 --> 48:48.686
Stop the car.

48:48.840 --> 48:50.729
You stop the car right now! Stop the car!

48:50.880 --> 48:52.769
Okay, okay. That's a great idea, Jet.

48:52.920 --> 48:54.570
We should get off the grid right now.

48:55.880 --> 48:57.689
Whoa!

49:02.520 --> 49:04.682
All right. We're clear.

49:10.520 --> 49:11.681
Okay.

49:12.200 --> 49:14.362
Okay. Let's just take some deep breaths.

49:14.520 --> 49:16.045
Okay? Deep breaths.

49:16.960 --> 49:19.566
All you gotta do is get out of this car

49:19.720 --> 49:23.291
and have a rational conversation
with Bob and he'll understand.

49:32.040 --> 49:34.884
Robert, I would like to
go home now, please.

49:35.040 --> 49:36.724
Buddy, you and me both.

49:36.880 --> 49:39.121
But until we clear our names,
there's no going home.

49:39.280 --> 49:41.487
I'm sorry, can you clarify
that last sentence for me?

49:41.640 --> 49:42.926
Yeah, well, now that you're in...

49:43.120 --> 49:45.248
Let me stop you right there. I'm not in.

49:45.400 --> 49:47.084
I never said that I was in.

49:47.240 --> 49:50.005
In fact, I expressly remember
saying that I was out!

49:50.160 --> 49:51.241
I know, but they think you're in.

49:51.800 --> 49:52.801
I am...

49:53.320 --> 49:55.243
I'm fucking out! I'm out!

49:55.400 --> 49:56.401
- What's left to tell?
- Hey, no, I get it.

49:56.560 --> 49:58.244
- I'm not in!
- I'm just saying they think you're in.

49:58.400 --> 50:01.370
- I'm not in! I am not in!
- I get it.

50:01.600 --> 50:03.602
I'm not in! I'm out!

50:03.760 --> 50:06.240
One sec, Jet, just gotta disable the GPS.

50:06.680 --> 50:07.681
Where did you...

50:08.120 --> 50:09.451
You wanna go under... That's fine!

50:09.920 --> 50:10.807
Wait a minute.

50:10.960 --> 50:11.961
You did this on purpose, didn't you?

50:13.360 --> 50:15.647
This whole thing was done on purpose.

50:15.800 --> 50:17.370
This is your plan!

50:17.520 --> 50:19.249
You tricked me!

50:19.400 --> 50:21.687
It's fine, but I know you tricked me.

50:21.840 --> 50:23.285
- Trick you?
- You tricked... Hey, boy!

50:23.440 --> 50:25.568
What? What'd you just...

50:25.720 --> 50:26.801
I didn't trick you,
you offered to help me.

50:27.320 --> 50:28.845
You know what's funny? Harris told me.

50:29.040 --> 50:30.451
She told me everything, man.

50:30.600 --> 50:32.170
She told me that you stole the codes.

50:32.320 --> 50:34.129
Let me tell you something about Harris.
You can't trust her.

50:34.280 --> 50:36.487
She's already trying to frame me
for my partner's murder!

50:36.920 --> 50:38.604
- You killed your partner?
- No.

50:38.800 --> 50:39.801
I would never do that.

50:39.960 --> 50:41.485
The Black Badger killed my partner.

50:41.680 --> 50:43.569
Let me explain to you something, dude.
This is what happened.

50:44.880 --> 50:47.121
After The Black Badger
stole the satellite encryption codes,

50:47.280 --> 50:50.887
my partner Phil and I
tracked him to a penthouse in Kiev.

50:51.040 --> 50:52.166
- Hey, Phil.
- Yeah.

50:52.800 --> 50:54.006
I'll see you on the other side.

50:55.320 --> 50:56.810
See you on the other side.

50:58.120 --> 50:59.645
All right.

50:59.800 --> 51:01.325
God, I love that guy.

51:01.480 --> 51:02.845
He knew we were coming, so he set a trap.

51:03.000 --> 51:05.048
Hey, Bob! Bob!

51:05.200 --> 51:06.281
No!

51:06.440 --> 51:08.966
Phil was my partner, my teammate

51:09.720 --> 51:11.484
- and I couldn't save him.
- No!

51:14.320 --> 51:15.890
It was awful, Cal.

51:16.040 --> 51:17.485
It was a setup, right from the get-go.

51:19.080 --> 51:20.127
Damn, man.

51:20.680 --> 51:21.841
The Black Badger was never there.

51:22.000 --> 51:24.287
I should've been the one
on that elevator, not Phil.

51:24.760 --> 51:25.807
God.

51:26.000 --> 51:28.367
Okay. Bob, please...

51:28.560 --> 51:30.801
I'm begging you, man.
Can you just let me go home?

51:30.960 --> 51:32.485
CJ, I totally understand.

51:32.640 --> 51:34.449
But right now,
Agent Harris and her taskforce

51:34.600 --> 51:36.329
has that place surveilled up the yin-yang.

51:36.480 --> 51:38.050
She's got contract killers looking for us.

51:38.240 --> 51:39.480
Your place isn't safe.

51:39.640 --> 51:41.324
Oh, my God. Maggie.

51:41.480 --> 51:43.687
Maggie! What the hell
am I supposed to do about Maggie?

51:46.160 --> 51:47.366
Get down, Jet!

51:56.600 --> 51:58.045
Shit! Oh!

51:59.000 --> 52:00.001
Look out, Bob!

52:12.000 --> 52:14.571
Who the hell is that? Who is that? Bob?

52:14.720 --> 52:15.960
Oh, shit.

52:21.240 --> 52:22.241
Larry.

52:25.320 --> 52:26.606
Thought you retired.

52:26.760 --> 52:27.761
I did.

52:28.320 --> 52:30.448
But you're worth a lot of money,
Bob, dead or alive.

52:30.680 --> 52:33.160
Well, tough luck,
because I've got back up.

52:33.320 --> 52:34.401
Ain't that right, Jet?

52:37.280 --> 52:38.281
Jet!

53:00.680 --> 53:03.001
Hey, baby. I know. I'm sorry I'm late.

53:03.200 --> 53:05.282
The stupid Koplin deposition ran long.

53:05.440 --> 53:07.442
I'm leaving right now.
I'll meet you at the house.

53:07.600 --> 53:08.806
No, no, no! Don't go home!

53:08.960 --> 53:10.610
- Don't go home!
- Why? What's going on?

53:10.760 --> 53:13.525
Nothing! Nothing.
I'm just running late, too.

53:13.680 --> 53:16.126
So I was gonna say
let's just meet at Dr. Dan's office.

53:17.360 --> 53:19.328
Yeah. Okay. Is everything all right?

53:19.480 --> 53:21.801
Yeah! Yeah. Why?

53:21.960 --> 53:23.200
Everything's fine.

53:23.360 --> 53:25.522
Because you kind of sound
like Ray Liotta at the end of Goodfellas.

53:25.800 --> 53:27.086
What?

53:28.240 --> 53:30.368
That's so funny, babe.
That's such a good reference.

53:30.560 --> 53:32.324
That's classic Mags right there.

53:32.520 --> 53:35.285
So, okay. So you're not
gonna go home, right?

53:35.480 --> 53:36.720
Okay, fine. I won't go home.

53:36.880 --> 53:38.245
I'll meet you at Dr. Dan's. See you soon.

53:38.440 --> 53:39.566
Okay. All right, bye.

53:39.720 --> 53:40.767
All right, bye.

54:03.880 --> 54:04.881
Get in.

54:22.240 --> 54:25.961
I'm gonna address
the elephant in the room.

54:26.120 --> 54:29.442
Okay, first of all, you...

54:29.600 --> 54:32.444
You guys, I want to say sorry to.

54:32.600 --> 54:36.161
Because what you're probably thinking
is not what happened.

54:36.320 --> 54:37.367
Accidents!

54:37.720 --> 54:38.767
I know you're like,

54:38.960 --> 54:41.441
"How can you accidentally pistol-whip
somebody and shoot somebody?"

54:41.600 --> 54:42.601
It can happen.

54:42.760 --> 54:46.446
Okay? Today is proof
that it can happen. So...

54:46.600 --> 54:48.443
I'm glad I got to get that off my chest.

54:48.960 --> 54:50.689
Relax, Mr. Joyner. I believe you.

54:50.840 --> 54:52.729
Okay, thank you.

54:52.880 --> 54:55.451
Trust me, I know a
scared-shitless civilian when I see one.

54:55.640 --> 54:56.880
You don't have to convince me.

54:57.040 --> 54:59.805
You got him over here. That is me.

54:59.960 --> 55:01.803
Right now, I'm not comfortable.

55:01.960 --> 55:03.689
Okay, I am scared, okay?

55:03.840 --> 55:06.207
I don't have no shit in my system.

55:06.400 --> 55:08.368
If I sat down on a toilet,
nothing's coming out.

55:08.520 --> 55:09.681
Farts or just air.

55:16.320 --> 55:17.560
It'd sound like lasers.

55:17.720 --> 55:19.165
Thank you for that description.

55:19.720 --> 55:21.484
Mr. Joyner, let me explain something.

55:21.640 --> 55:22.926
Bob's last forced psych eval

55:23.080 --> 55:26.004
show a person rapidly losing
his grip on reality.

55:26.160 --> 55:27.685
Bob became obsessed with a ghost,

55:28.160 --> 55:29.366
a figment of his imagination,

55:29.520 --> 55:31.170
he started calling "The Black Badger."

55:31.320 --> 55:33.322
This obsession led to an instability,

55:33.480 --> 55:36.165
first reported by his partner, Phil,
three weeks ago.

55:36.320 --> 55:38.846
Just before Phil was killed in the field.

55:39.000 --> 55:40.206
Do you know how Phil died?

55:40.360 --> 55:43.170
Yeah, Bob told me that
The Black Badger killed him.

55:47.400 --> 55:48.447
What?

55:49.360 --> 55:50.361
What?

55:50.520 --> 55:54.286
Mr. Joyner, Bob Stone is The Black Badger.

55:54.880 --> 55:57.406
Phil was Bob's partner of six years.

55:57.560 --> 55:58.561
His best friend.

55:58.760 --> 56:01.047
- See you on the other side.
- See you on the other side.

56:02.040 --> 56:03.530
Hey, Bob!

56:03.680 --> 56:05.967
After he stole
the satellite encryption codes

56:06.120 --> 56:07.281
Bob betrayed Phil.

56:07.440 --> 56:08.441
No!

56:09.200 --> 56:11.885
He killed him to cover his tracks.

56:15.880 --> 56:18.963
And, after that, Bob went rogue.

56:19.200 --> 56:20.929
This is all that's left of Phil.

56:24.520 --> 56:27.205
Um, this is PornHub.

56:27.960 --> 56:30.884
Oh, shit, shit, shit. Sorry.

56:31.720 --> 56:32.721
There you go.

56:33.360 --> 56:36.648
Oh! Oh, God! Oh, I didn't see that coming.

56:37.400 --> 56:38.526
Oh, man!

56:40.000 --> 56:42.162
- It's a hell of a way to go.
- Okay, wait a minute.

56:42.320 --> 56:44.641
Why wouldn't Bob just go sell
the satellite encryption codes himself?

56:44.800 --> 56:46.609
Because in a black market
blind-bidding situation,

56:46.760 --> 56:48.410
the buyer and the seller,
they don't know each other.

56:48.560 --> 56:50.961
They need the auction site
to tell them exactly where to meet up

56:51.120 --> 56:52.246
and when to make the exchange.

56:52.840 --> 56:55.923
The transaction number
from the auction site gives them that,

56:56.080 --> 56:58.082
which means Bob still needs you.

56:59.080 --> 57:02.561
Which is why we find ourselves
in a little catch-and-release scenario.

57:02.760 --> 57:04.808
You are the only one Bob trusts.

57:05.600 --> 57:07.011
That's why we're putting you in the field.

57:07.160 --> 57:09.049
The next time you're with Bob,

57:10.080 --> 57:11.764
press this button.

57:11.920 --> 57:13.285
We're going to have him cold.

57:19.560 --> 57:21.369
Now, go take care of your marriage.

57:21.520 --> 57:24.444
One more thing. Don't tell your wife shit.

57:25.600 --> 57:26.931
All right.

57:28.840 --> 57:30.001
I just don't know what's wrong.

57:30.160 --> 57:33.928
I mean, the man that I married,
the person I knew in high school,

57:34.080 --> 57:38.210
he was filled
with drive and desire. I mean...

57:38.360 --> 57:41.285
We used to sneak off every lunch hour
and make out under the gym bleachers.

57:41.440 --> 57:43.408
Like, that guy, back then,

57:43.600 --> 57:45.762
- he wanted things, you know?
- Hmm.

57:45.920 --> 57:48.207
Hey, I'm sorry I'm late.
I couldn't find parking.

57:48.400 --> 57:50.164
Hi, no, no, it's okay.
We got started without you.

57:50.360 --> 57:52.203
Babe, Calvin, this is Dr. Dan.

57:52.640 --> 57:53.721
Hello, Calvin.

57:53.880 --> 57:56.008
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, jeez. What's the matter?

57:56.200 --> 57:58.441
- Holy shit! Get behind me!
- Honey... Calvin, what?

57:58.600 --> 58:00.887
It's okay, Maggie. It's okay. Just relax.

58:01.080 --> 58:03.367
This is a very common reaction
in the therapeutic process.

58:03.520 --> 58:04.521
- It is?
- What?

58:04.680 --> 58:05.681
It is. It absolutely is.

58:05.840 --> 58:08.969
Calvin, this is a very safe place.
Please, sit down.

58:09.120 --> 58:10.929
- This is not a safe place!
- No, no, no. Honey, it's a...

58:11.080 --> 58:12.570
No, this is most definitely
not a safe place!

58:12.720 --> 58:14.529
Me and my wife are leaving. Let's go.

58:14.680 --> 58:16.682
No, no, no! You are going to sit down,

58:16.840 --> 58:19.810
and we are going to go through
this therapeutic process...

58:19.960 --> 58:21.849
- Yes.
- ...together, as a couple.

58:22.400 --> 58:24.243
Um... Fine, fine, fine.

58:24.400 --> 58:25.890
Sit down. Thank you.

58:26.040 --> 58:27.087
Fine.

58:27.240 --> 58:31.006
Okay, guys. Why don't we start off
with a little bit of word association?

58:31.160 --> 58:32.207
Okay.

58:32.400 --> 58:33.401
This is exciting.

58:33.560 --> 58:35.528
I've heard this can
really open a couple up.

58:36.280 --> 58:39.648
Uh, Maggie, I'm going to offer you a word,

58:39.800 --> 58:43.691
and you respond
however you're moved to from here.

58:43.840 --> 58:44.887
Okay.

58:45.080 --> 58:46.320
- Black.
- White.

58:46.480 --> 58:47.970
- Water.
- Ocean.

58:48.120 --> 58:50.361
- Sunshine.
- Happy.

58:51.000 --> 58:53.480
- I'm very impressed, Maggie.
- Really?

58:53.640 --> 58:54.926
You're very in tune.

58:55.480 --> 58:56.891
I'm very in tune.

58:57.040 --> 58:59.122
Calvin, you're next.

58:59.280 --> 59:00.964
I do not want to do this.

59:01.280 --> 59:03.806
Relax, Calvin. There are no wrong answers.

59:03.960 --> 59:04.961
Up.

59:06.640 --> 59:07.687
Down.

59:08.280 --> 59:09.281
Mmm.

59:10.200 --> 59:11.406
"Mmm." What is that?

59:11.760 --> 59:12.647
What're you writing in your book?

59:12.800 --> 59:14.131
- It's fine. Don't freak out.
- Nobody's freaking out.

59:14.320 --> 59:15.970
I just don't understand
the rules to the game.

59:16.120 --> 59:17.326
Freaking out.

59:18.280 --> 59:20.203
Let's switch gears for a second, okay?

59:21.640 --> 59:23.324
Maggie, during lovemaking,

59:24.920 --> 59:28.003
have you ever placed anything
inside of Calvin's anus?

59:28.160 --> 59:29.491
What the hell did you just say?

59:29.640 --> 59:31.529
Well, yeah, there was this one time.

59:31.680 --> 59:33.887
- You remember? Game of Thrones finale.
- What are you talking about?

59:34.040 --> 59:36.088
I was Khaleesi, you were Littlefinger...

59:36.240 --> 59:38.891
- Okay, all right, stop. That's enough.
- Please, please, please.

59:39.240 --> 59:42.528
Why don't we try a simple
role-playing exercise?

59:42.720 --> 59:44.529
Calvin, you be Calvin

59:44.720 --> 59:47.121
and I will become Maggie.

59:47.440 --> 59:48.805
Mmm.

59:49.520 --> 59:50.851
I'm confused.

59:55.520 --> 59:57.204
It's called "soul gazing."

59:57.400 --> 01:00:01.007
Stare into my soul
and I'll stare into yours.

01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:03.609
- Maggie, this...
- Hey. Shh.

01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:05.842
There's no talking, and don't look away.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.365
Stare into my soul.

01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:09.006
You are not my...

01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:10.207
Shh. There's no talking.

01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:12.250
Babe, I'm not staring...

01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:15.684
Me and you. Stay with me. I'm your wife.

01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:17.530
You are not my wife.

01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:21.405
How could you hit your wife?

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.240
How can I... How can I what?

01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:25.004
- You hit your wife!
- No...

01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:26.161
- He hit me!
- Okay.

01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:27.321
- He hit you!
- Okay.

01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:28.766
You hit us!

01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:35.084
- I'm swaddling you.
- I know what you're doing.

01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:36.651
- I'm swaddling you.
- I know what you're...

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:37.801
Come here.

01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:39.521
Oh, my God!

01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:40.961
You...

01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:44.526
You know what? We're leaving! Let's go!

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.650
This is not real.

01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:48.370
It's real to me.

01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:49.726
You know what, Calvin?

01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:52.042
If you can't commit
to working on our marriage,

01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:53.804
then you need to let me know.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.331
Maggie, you...

01:00:57.600 --> 01:00:59.250
- What!
- Oh, my God!

01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:00.526
You're... Something's not right.

01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:03.730
Come on, Jet, listen.
Come on, come on, Jet!

01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:05.848
Now, I know things got
a little rough there at the end.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.241
But the truth is, with all the heat
that you have coming down on you,

01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:10.323
Maggie is definitely safer without you.

01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:13.687
And, trust me,
when this whole thing is said and done

01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:15.410
and you basically
save the entire free world,

01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:17.961
she's going to forgive you.
It'll all work itself out.

01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:19.565
It'll all work itself out?

01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:22.283
Okay, Bob, you know,
I'm sick of playing games with you.

01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:23.851
Where's the real Dr. Dan?

01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:25.681
What-what?

01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:28.764
Oh, my... Dr. Dan,
I had nothing to do with this.

01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:30.251
He's fine. I'll get you some water
in a little bit.

01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:32.641
- Thanks, doc.
- You know...

01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:34.803
That's it. That is it.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.650
That is it.

01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:39.087
All right, Jet.

01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:41.242
I see that Harris has given you
a button to push.

01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:44.806
Relax, I would've taken the same deal,
too, if I was in your shoes.

01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:47.281
Otherwise, she wouldn't
let you out of her sight, right?

01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:48.885
It makes perfect sense.

01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:51.764
But you're not going to
press the button, right?

01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:55.168
You got the top-secret satellite codes?

01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:56.960
Yes or no?

01:01:57.120 --> 01:01:58.929
This ain't the time to bullshit me.

01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:00.809
Okay, my ass is sweating.

01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:02.200
I'm nervous. Don't bullshit me!

01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:04.482
Of course not, dude. Hey, hey, come on!

01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:05.971
Of course I don't have the codes.

01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:07.610
Why would I go through
all this trouble, then?

01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:10.001
I need your skill set, Jet, to help me get

01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:12.282
the bank transaction numbers
to the winning bid.

01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:14.124
We already know it's going down tonight

01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:15.645
from the countdown on your computer.

01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:17.290
Now, all we need is the "where."

01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:19.927
And the bank transaction numbers
will give us the "where."

01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:21.286
That's why I need you.

01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:22.805
Your job gives you access to

01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:24.689
exactly that kind of information.

01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:26.962
Then we can get The Badger,
we can get the buyer

01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:28.201
in one fell swoop.

01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:30.089
And it'll all be over tonight.

01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:31.486
Please, I swear.

01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:33.125
You gotta believe me.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.082
Can't you just get us
the transaction number?

01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:47.767
Not when the money
originates from an offshore account.

01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:51.287
When that happens, then only a certified
international banking official can access it.

01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:53.522
But, it shouldn't be a problem.
We just give this guy

01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:55.444
the offshore account numbers
that you gave me,

01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:57.090
then he can give us the transaction number

01:02:57.240 --> 01:02:59.402
without knowing that
he's committing treason when he does it.

01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:00.766
Sound familiar?

01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:03.008
Ouch! Low blow, CJ.

01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:05.083
Hey, besides,
it's only treason if we're wrong.

01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:06.571
Who's this mystery man?

01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:08.961
It's Trevor.

01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:14.806
Trevor.

01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:19.170
This week just keeps getting better.

01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:24.328
You know, I mean, Robbie Wheirdicht and
Calvin "The Golden Jet" Joyner in my office.

01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:26.448
Who would've thunk it? Not me.

01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:28.443
This is great, huh?

01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:30.602
Talk about caterpillar to the butterfly...

01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:32.683
What is this? P90X?

01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:35.730
More like "P1,000,000X," huh?

01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:37.450
Congratulations.

01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:39.370
Hey, I, um...

01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:40.965
I really appreciate the help, Trevor.

01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:43.361
My client's all on me
to get this stuff handled right away.

01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:44.681
So, you know, if we could...

01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:46.803
Say no more.
It's my pleasure. I've been there.

01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:48.450
These international accounts
can be very, very tricky

01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:49.647
if you don't have the right clearances.

01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:51.604
You can get a bunch of digital red tape.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.968
I'm happy to help, you know?

01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:55.167
Robbie.

01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:57.129
You're such a blast from the past, buddy.

01:03:57.280 --> 01:03:58.281
How long has it been since I saw you?

01:03:58.440 --> 01:03:59.487
Was it high school?

01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:03.481
What's that?

01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:06.086
Um... How we doing
with those account access codes?

01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:07.287
- Are they coming?
- It's coming.

01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:08.680
- Everything's good?
- It's coming.

01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:11.286
I'm going as fast as I can. I know
you guys are in a rush. I'm so sorry.

01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:13.488
Anything for a couple of fellow Centaurs.

01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:16.405
Speaking of which, you guys are going
to the reunion tonight, right?

01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:20.169
No, I don't think so.

01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:21.481
You're both going.

01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:23.369
Here it is.
Here's your transaction number.

01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:25.124
You're both going
because you want to know what?

01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:26.520
Stinky Pete's going to be there.

01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:29.604
And Jimmy Longballs called me.
He's going to be hanging.

01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:33.284
Carlos Nagasaki, the Mexican eggroll.
He's going to be there.

01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:35.802
You guys will be missing out on a big one.

01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:37.121
Plus you know what they're going to do?

01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:39.282
They're going to vote on
homecoming king and queen again.

01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:41.044
Maybe you and Maggie
can make it two for two.

01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:43.522
Now, before you go,
stay seated one second.

01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:45.364
Give me two minutes, sit down.

01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:47.644
Men,

01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:49.491
a few years ago...

01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:52.648
I found the Lord Almighty.

01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:53.801
And, ever since then,

01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:56.804
my life has been
completely different. Okay?

01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:59.327
He's got a plan for
each and every one of us

01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:01.369
and, in his infinite wisdom,

01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:03.761
he makes no mistakes. Hmm?

01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:05.651
You're right about that.

01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:08.525
I think the Lord put you here because he
wants me to get something off my chest.

01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:11.685
He wants me to clear my conscience
and he wants me to ask for forgiveness.

01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:12.881
Robert.

01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:17.165
What I did to you at that rally
in senior year was a cowardly act.

01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:19.687
It's something that
I've regretted every single day.

01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:22.844
Yeah. I mean,
bullying is a national crisis.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:27.369
It can leave people
with a lifetime of pain.

01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:30.967
And I just have no excuse
for what I did to you.

01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:33.407
I mean, I did grow up in a house
with a father who was physical,

01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:35.881
but that doesn't give me
the right to take it out on somebody

01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:38.520
who at the time
was weaker, you know? So...

01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:42.009
Calvin, with this particular
transgression,

01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:45.687
I not only embarrassed him
but I also ruined your final speech.

01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:47.490
- No, no.
- Yes, I did.

01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:49.961
- It's okay. No, it's okay.
- No, really, I stole your thunder.

01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:52.521
And it's another thing that
I've had to live with every single day.

01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:57.404
And I work through it in individual therapy
as well as group, and I pray about it.

01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:00.326
So...

01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:07.930
I just want to say how truly sorry I am

01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:10.606
for what happened, you know.

01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:12.205
Or for what I did.

01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:13.686
It didn't just happen. I did it.

01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:16.571
I did it, and I wish to God
that I had not done it.

01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:20.209
So, I'm hoping that
you can find it in your heart

01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:23.289
to forgive me.

01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:27.208
I wasn't expecting this at all.

01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:29.044
Don't I know it. I know it.

01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:31.730
I'm just so happy.

01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:34.410
I don't know what to say.

01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:36.764
How about you say...

01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:42.211
"The Oscar goes to Trevor Olson."

01:06:45.640 --> 01:06:47.244
What do you mean?

01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:56.686
Weird Dick!

01:06:56.840 --> 01:06:58.444
You stupid ass!

01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:00.284
Good God, you're dumb!

01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:02.363
Dumber than ever, I guess!

01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:04.284
And you, too, Calvin!

01:07:04.440 --> 01:07:07.091
Look at that stupid look
on those two faces.

01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:10.084
"The Lord taught me to care."
Unbelievable.

01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:13.528
I'm a Scientologist. Okay, that's "A."

01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:15.967
And thetan-free since 2003.

01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:17.121
Clear as shit.

01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:18.520
And "I'm sorry for what I did"?

01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:19.926
Let me tell you what I'm sorry about.

01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:22.447
I'm sorry I didn't toss your naked ass
out there three more times.

01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:23.971
It was the best senior prank ever.

01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:25.610
I still get emails about it.

01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:27.683
And if I'd had
one of these bad boys back then,

01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:29.171
I would have shot it, uploaded it,

01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:31.766
and it would have gone crazy viral,
a zillion hits.

01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:32.967
Know what?

01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:34.724
You're going to regret
you ever opened your mouth.

01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:37.281
- You hear me, Trevor?
- Yeah? How come, Calvin?

01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:38.930
Because he's about to
whoop your ass, that's why.

01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:40.081
Who is?

01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:41.327
Bob, get up and whoop his ass.

01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:43.562
Here she comes!
Let me tell you something...

01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:46.610
Weird Dick can't chug a bunch
of fucking steroids and elk urine

01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:48.649
and suddenly be able to kick my ass.

01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:50.802
Fuck that! It ain't gonna happen.

01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:52.446
'Cause here's why.

01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:57.367
Once a fat kid, always a fat kid.

01:07:57.880 --> 01:07:59.006
Huh? Prove me wrong.

01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:00.730
Bob, come on. Do what you did in the bar.

01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:13.722
Come on, hit me!

01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:16.167
And I'll sue your ass,
and take your fanny pack away.

01:08:18.279 --> 01:08:19.725
You got to make poopies?

01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:21.081
What's wrong, Bob?

01:08:21.279 --> 01:08:22.327
We got a john here.

01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:24.683
Or you got to change your rag?

01:08:25.399 --> 01:08:26.401
Maybe that's it.

01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:28.524
Jenny, you got an extra rag?

01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:31.721
- What's the matter with you?
- I just want to go.

01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:33.166
She wants to go.

01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:35.881
Go ahead. There you go.

01:08:36.479 --> 01:08:37.560
No, it's a push.

01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:39.926
Boy, 50-50 shot. You missed that.

01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:41.411
At least you found the handle.

01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:44.040
Boy, he's still a scared little bitch.

01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:45.531
You know, you're still an asshole.

01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:47.768
Yeah, well, you're still
shorter than my cat.

01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:49.720
Here's your transaction number.

01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:51.569
Hit it, dick licker.

01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:55.167
- Thank you, Trevor.
- Yup.

01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:57.849
Glad to see you haven't changed a bit.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:59.001
Bye-bye now.

01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:00.446
- Was it push or pull?
- Clean push.

01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:02.125
- Which one is it?
- You want me to do it for you?

01:09:02.319 --> 01:09:03.321
Which one is it?

01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:07.131
Hey, hey, hey! Goddamn it, Joyner!

01:09:07.279 --> 01:09:08.441
Jenny!

01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:11.490
Jenny, get the Windex!
And security for this one.

01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:13.926
Get your asshole off my door! That's it!

01:09:15.479 --> 01:09:17.368
Bob! Bob!

01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:19.523
Bob! Bob! Bob!

01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:28.846
Mr. Joyner. Guess who
we're about to arrest

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:30.968
for conspiracy to commit treason.

01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:36.200
That's right. Your lovely wife.

01:09:36.399 --> 01:09:38.163
So, here's what you're going to do.

01:09:38.359 --> 01:09:40.886
You're going to tell us
exactly where you and Bob are.

01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:44.567
Then you're going to go outside and you're
going to keep Bob on-site until we arrive.

01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:47.006
And if he leaves, you lose.

01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:49.330
Is that clear?

01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:55.841
Oh, hey.

01:09:56.040 --> 01:09:58.601
I don't know what happened
in there, and I just froze up.

01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:00.444
I locked up. I'm sorry.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:02.047
Look, Bob, I...

01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:04.567
No, I gotta tell you something,
CJ, listen.

01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:06.569
You're the only one
who's ever been nice to me,

01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:08.649
the only one who's never laughed at me.

01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:11.929
And you're the only one
in this whole world that I trust.

01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:17.647
And I know you have a lot
of friends, but I don't.

01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:20.805
You're my only friend, Calvin.

01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:24.086
And I will never
let you down again, I promise.

01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:27.410
I'm sorry, man.

01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:32.206
Sorry for what?

01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:34.044
I told Harris where we are.

01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:36.650
They were going to hurt Maggie.

01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:38.768
I had to. I didn't have a choice.

01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:40.406
I'm sorry.

01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:47.403
Freeze, Bob! Hands on your head!

01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:48.561
Do it now!

01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:22.325
I know you know how this goes,
so I'll spare you the dramatics.

01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:24.562
I'll ask you just once.

01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:26.961
Where are the satellite encryption codes?

01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:31.128
Aw. What's the matter, Bob?

01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:35.003
Are you upset that
your friend turned you in?

01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:37.210
I don't have any friends.

01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:39.044
Okay, I don't want to watch this, guys.

01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:40.611
Don't worry, it'll be over quick.

01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:42.330
She always gets them to break.

01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:44.887
Okay. You have it your way.

01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:46.644
We're going to do this old-school.

01:11:54.680 --> 01:11:56.603
Get the extraction tools.

01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:00.328
The extraction tools?

01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:02.648
If you don't have the stomach for it,
you can go.

01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:04.930
Come on.

01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:08.607
Stop recording.

01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:20.802
Why am I coming here?
I was told I'd be able to leave.

01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:22.041
You can leave,

01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:24.881
when Agent Harris says you can leave,
which might be never.

01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:26.445
I gotta watch this.

01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:36.325
I'm sorry, Bob.

01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:38.086
I'm sorry, man.

01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:52.406
Oh, Jesus!

01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:01.241
What the hell?

01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:04.484
Hey! Hey!

01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:07.041
Don't move!

01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:09.646
You get your hands off!
Get them off the keyboard!

01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:11.768
- What are you doing, Calvin?
- Give me your keycard!

01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:13.605
Give me your keycard!

01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:15.201
Give it to me.

01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:16.687
- Okay...
- Go sit down.

01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:18.444
Okay. Yeah.

01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:19.931
Sorry. I'm sorry.

01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:22.122
- Sit down! Sit down!
- Okay, okay, okay.

01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:25.361
You know, Bob?

01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:28.171
This is actually
my favorite part of the job.

01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:30.561
Thank you for being so uncooperative.

01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:33.771
What do you think your little buddy, Joyner,
would say if he could see you like this?

01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:35.121
Two words.

01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:36.327
I'm in.

01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:39.163
What-what?

01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:41.847
You're making a big mistake, Mr. Joyner.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:43.968
That's only if I'm wrong.

01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:47.325
Come on, Bob. Let's go!

01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:49.363
What're you doing? Come on, man!

01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:53.007
Okay, listen to me. Bob, I'm sorry.

01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:55.128
I'm sorry I double-crossed you.
You hear me?

01:13:55.320 --> 01:13:57.368
I should've believed you,
I should've trusted you, and I didn't.

01:13:57.520 --> 01:13:58.521
I'm sorry for that.

01:13:58.680 --> 01:14:01.251
Listen to me. Bob,
we don't have time for this, man!

01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:03.528
I need you to tap into
that super-spy stuff

01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:06.604
and I need you to get us the hell
out of here right now. Do you hear me?

01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:08.604
I'm not a super spy, Calvin.

01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:11.808
I'm Robbie Wheirdicht, super tool.

01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:14.042
No, stop. You're not a super tool.

01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:16.601
You're not even Robbie Wheirdicht.
You're Bob Stone!

01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:18.884
- I made that name up.
- So what?

01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:21.281
- It's not real.
- What does that mean? What does that mean?

01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:25.206
You think Mr. T and Sting
were born with those names?

01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:28.763
How do you think I got
the name "Golden Jet" at high school?

01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:31.844
- 'Cause you're awesome.
- No, that's not how.

01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:35.371
In the eighth grade, I ran track.
It was my first race.

01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:38.410
Okay, the race came down
to me and this other kid.

01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:40.050
I wanted to win the race so damn bad

01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:42.402
that I ended up peeing in my pants
at the finish line.

01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:44.404
That's how I got the name "Golden Jet."

01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:48.044
So, take it from a guy who's literally
pissed his pants in front of everybody

01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:49.565
just to win a race.

01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:51.723
You are who you decide to be.

01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:55.005
And you chose to be
an international CIA spy.

01:14:55.360 --> 01:14:57.283
Come on, man.
You get to kill people for a living.

01:14:57.760 --> 01:14:58.761
How cool is that?

01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:03.127
I don't know.

01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:04.401
Kinda cool I guess.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.128
What do you mean "kinda cool"?
Ain't no kinda cool.

01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:09.448
Stop it! It's awesome.

01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:11.091
Now, come on, man. We boys?

01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:13.761
- We're boys.
- Oh!

01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:16.441
Sorry, Jet.

01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:18.604
Oh, God!

01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:20.521
Oh, God!

01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:22.524
See? Good as new.

01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:25.643
Wow. Sorry, man.

01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:30.607
Go, go!

01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:32.167
Get me out!

01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:34.209
He got the jump on us. Give me the key.

01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:38.647
Look out, Bob!

01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:41.888
Here, Jet! Get him!

01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:43.451
Watch out!

01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:53.485
Did you see that, Bob?

01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:55.722
I did the thing! I did the thing, Bob!

01:15:55.880 --> 01:15:56.881
Yeah!

01:15:57.040 --> 01:15:58.963
Yeah! Yeah!

01:15:59.240 --> 01:16:00.605
- Come on! Follow me!
- Let's do it!

01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:03.331
No! What the fuck am I doing?
Here! You get the gun.

01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:05.130
- I'm behind you. Go.
- All right.

01:16:09.680 --> 01:16:11.523
Oh, my God. There's two of them.

01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:14.126
Yeah, I'll distract them
and you open the door, okay?

01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:15.691
- What? No!
- Let's roll.

01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:16.927
No, no.

01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:20.166
Go, go!

01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:23.042
- Close in!
- Moving out!

01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:25.123
- Freeze, Bob!
- Sorry about this, guys.

01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:29.850
Nope, come here.

01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:41.206
Come on.

01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:43.601
Wrong keycard, pal. Turn around.

01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:46.841
You needed this one.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:48.240
On the ground, now.

01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:49.686
Can I say something first?

01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:51.410
- What?
- This is going to hurt.

01:16:54.280 --> 01:16:56.442
- Hey, get the keycard! Let's roll.
- All right, all right.

01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:00.486
Which car are we taking?

01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:03.567
Not that one.

01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:05.364
Oh, my God.

01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:07.729
Oh, God. Oh, sh...

01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:09.641
Oh.

01:17:09.960 --> 01:17:11.166
Here we go, Jet.

01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:15.726
- Bob, they are shooting at us!
- It's okay, it's bulletproof.

01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:16.881
Drive, drive!

01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:29.966
Here you go, Jet.

01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:31.681
What's this?

01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:33.888
Bug-out bag, courtesy of the CIA.

01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:35.411
Go ahead and grab that
encrypted phone in there.

01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:36.561
For what?

01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:38.370
You still have the bank transaction code?

01:17:38.520 --> 01:17:41.444
How are transaction numbers gonna help us
find out where the bad guys are?

01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:44.126
Well, it's not bank transaction
numbers or codes, it's actually...

01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:45.805
Longitude and latitude.

01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:50.921
Look at the spy brain
on the Jet! What-what!

01:17:51.240 --> 01:17:53.481
You're like a chocolate Google.

01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:55.688
Bob, don't do that. Stop it. Stop it.

01:17:55.840 --> 01:17:56.921
You're getting good at this, man.

01:17:57.080 --> 01:17:58.923
Yeah, you're absolutely right.
It's longitude and latitude.

01:17:59.080 --> 01:18:02.527
All you gotta do is plug those
digits into the GPS, and boom!

01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:05.291
We're gonna catch the buyer
and The Badger, just like that.

01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:09.124
Boston.

01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:14.324
We're gonna need a plane.

01:18:27.720 --> 01:18:29.006
You ever steal a plane before?

01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:31.447
- I stole some Starbursts one time.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:33.962
So I don't know
if that compares or anything,

01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:35.565
but I wasn't successful with that.

01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:36.846
On the way out, I dropped 'em.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:38.206
Dropped the whole bag. The guy caught me.

01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:40.004
"What's that?" I just said, "A Starburst."

01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:42.162
Told him myself. It was a mess.

01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:47.406
Check it out. The universe provides.

01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:50.921
Oh.

01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:53.881
Golden Jet.

01:18:54.120 --> 01:18:55.531
- Golden Jet.
- Golden Jet.

01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:01.329
- It's just one guard in there.
- All right.

01:19:01.480 --> 01:19:03.130
90% of spy work is distraction.

01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:05.561
You get in there and distract that guard,
I'm gonna get us a plane.

01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:07.327
What?

01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:10.650
I don't know what the hell you expect...

01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:14.081
Bob!

01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:15.881
Bob!

01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:17.567
Fuck!

01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:19.241
Fuck you, Bob!

01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:21.641
Damn it!

01:19:29.720 --> 01:19:32.041
Hey, I need a plane.

01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:35.164
Sir, you cannot be in here.
This is a private airfield.

01:19:35.320 --> 01:19:37.846
I understand that but I have an organ
in this cooler right now

01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:40.042
that needs to get transported ASAP.

01:19:40.720 --> 01:19:41.721
Really?

01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:44.924
Because my sister-in-law
had a heart transplant last year

01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:47.924
and they did not bring it
in a Playmate lunch cooler.

01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:49.889
I hate to break it to you,

01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:51.769
but this is not a...

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:54.081
- This is not a heart.
- It's not a heart?

01:19:55.360 --> 01:19:56.407
No, it's not.

01:19:56.600 --> 01:19:57.806
Hmm. What is it then?

01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:01.042
- It's a dick.
- Okay.

01:20:02.600 --> 01:20:04.489
I am made of questions right now.

01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:05.926
Well, you don't have to ask.

01:20:06.080 --> 01:20:07.889
Last night, lady got into it with a man.

01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:09.724
She ended up cutting his pecker off.

01:20:09.880 --> 01:20:11.769
She left with it, got in a car, drove,

01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:13.888
got on 95, threw it out the window.

01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:17.084
The second largest penis hunt
in the state history.

01:20:17.240 --> 01:20:20.006
The man was Korean, so you better
believe it took a long time to find.

01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:22.489
You're stereotyping Korean dicks.

01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:23.721
That's racist.

01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:25.649
I've seen Korean dicks bigger than you.

01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:28.366
Okay, after finding it,
the guy brought it to me,

01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:31.364
and he said, "Do your due diligence in
getting this dick where it's got to go."

01:20:31.520 --> 01:20:32.806
That's what I do.

01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:35.281
I'm a dick deliverer specialist.

01:20:35.720 --> 01:20:36.721
Oh, DDS?

01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:38.564
Like a dentist but for dicks.

01:20:39.320 --> 01:20:40.321
Uh...

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.810
So, people are like,
"Here's a dick. Find a plane."

01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:46.722
That's how you do it?
You're like an Uber for dicks?

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:48.684
Where do you get these jobs?
On Craigslist?

01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:50.763
Okay, sir, we don't need
to demean each other here.

01:20:50.920 --> 01:20:52.285
I don't believe a word you're saying.

01:20:52.920 --> 01:20:54.206
Let me see it.

01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:56.564
I have no problem showing you this.

01:20:56.720 --> 01:20:59.166
So if you wanna see it
then get ready to see.

01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:01.443
- Here I go.
- Go for it.

01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:05.604
Oh, shit! Oh, shit.

01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:08.206
I'm just kidding. This is my friend.

01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:10.244
- Oh!
- It's my buddy.

01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:12.289
His name's Snake Gyllenhaal.

01:21:12.480 --> 01:21:14.482
- He guards my lunch.
- Okay, that's enough.

01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:39.611
It's gotta be Harris, right?

01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:41.927
What do you mean?

01:21:42.120 --> 01:21:43.645
I mean, she's gotta be The Black Badger.

01:21:43.800 --> 01:21:44.961
It's the only thing that makes sense.

01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:46.884
I mean, she's had access
to the encryption codes

01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:49.691
and she's so hot and bothered about
pinning this whole thing on you.

01:21:49.880 --> 01:21:50.961
It's gotta be her!

01:21:51.120 --> 01:21:52.645
I don't know, Jet.

01:21:52.840 --> 01:21:54.729
I'm pretty sure she thinks
I'm The Black Badger.

01:21:54.880 --> 01:21:56.928
She worked me over pretty good
in that interrogation room.

01:21:57.080 --> 01:21:59.162
Hold on, wait, wait... What's going on?

01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:01.966
What's that?
What's going on right now, Bob?

01:22:02.120 --> 01:22:04.282
No biggie. We're completely outta gas.

01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:05.970
Oh, my... Oh!

01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:10.207
We're going down, Jet!
There's nothing I can do!

01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:13.006
- Oh, shit!
- Really quickly...

01:22:13.160 --> 01:22:16.767
What's the one thing
you wish you'd done in your life?

01:22:16.920 --> 01:22:19.287
The one thing I wish I hadn't done
is not get in a plane with a guy

01:22:19.440 --> 01:22:21.363
who didn't check the goddamned fuel!

01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:24.490
- Why wouldn't you check the fuel?
- No, something that's real.

01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:27.086
What's the one thing
you regret not doing for you?

01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:29.402
Oh, my God! I think we're gonna die!

01:22:34.120 --> 01:22:36.088
Not having a kid, man!

01:22:36.600 --> 01:22:37.806
Not being a father!

01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:40.327
I regret not being a father!

01:22:40.480 --> 01:22:42.369
Maggie, I should've gave you a kid!

01:22:42.560 --> 01:22:45.006
I should've gave you my seed, Maggie!

01:22:45.160 --> 01:22:46.571
I should've!

01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:48.085
I'm so selfish!

01:22:49.480 --> 01:22:51.482
I'm sorry, Maggie!

01:22:55.640 --> 01:22:57.927
- That wasn't so hard, right?
- What?

01:22:58.080 --> 01:22:59.809
Hey, just for the record,

01:22:59.960 --> 01:23:01.644
I think you'd make a great dad.

01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:04.089
Did you just fake this whole thing?

01:23:04.760 --> 01:23:05.761
Yeah, kinda.

01:23:05.920 --> 01:23:07.570
You gotta be shitting me glory!

01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:09.210
No, not at all.

01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:11.442
I just thought that maybe a
facing-your-own-death situation

01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:14.683
might help motivate you
to clarify some of your goals in life.

01:23:14.880 --> 01:23:16.405
And, hey, between me and you,

01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:18.564
I know you've been struggling
a little bit.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.207
You know what I'm struggling with
right now, Bob?

01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:22.850
Not whooping your ass.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.082
Okay, Jet.
Hey, you're really cute when you cry.

01:23:25.240 --> 01:23:27.163
Stop it! Enough!

01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:42.006
I don't get it.

01:23:42.200 --> 01:23:45.482
I mean, if these coordinates are correct,
we should be standing right on top of it.

01:23:45.640 --> 01:23:48.530
The deal doesn't go down
for another 30 minutes, Jet,

01:23:48.680 --> 01:23:51.206
- so we're kinda early.
- No!

01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:52.725
Why would you do it
out in the open like this?

01:23:52.920 --> 01:23:54.445
Why would you take that risk?

01:23:54.600 --> 01:23:56.284
Just doesn't make any sense, man.

01:23:57.600 --> 01:23:59.284
Shit! Come on.

01:24:01.320 --> 01:24:02.367
Wait.

01:24:04.040 --> 01:24:05.929
Oh, wait. It's not happening up here.

01:24:07.720 --> 01:24:09.131
No, it's not. It's...

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.571
Oh, it's happening beneath us. Look.

01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:16.609
It's an underground parking garage.

01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:18.965
Yeah, that's a good eye, Jet.

01:24:19.480 --> 01:24:21.721
Why don't you stay up here?
Keep overwatch.

01:24:21.880 --> 01:24:23.370
I'll go down there and check things out.

01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:25.363
Wait, what? No, I'm going with you.

01:24:25.520 --> 01:24:28.285
You can't go with me.
The smarter play is if we split up.

01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:29.646
Smarter play for who?

01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:31.730
Do you know what happens
when people split up, Bob?

01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:32.967
Somebody dies!

01:24:33.120 --> 01:24:34.531
I'd be the one to die. You know why?

01:24:34.680 --> 01:24:37.081
Because I don't have a bulletproof vest
and I don't have a gun!

01:24:37.240 --> 01:24:38.890
Which means that you
are my bulletproof vest!

01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:41.441
My little black ass is gonna stay
behind you, you're not leaving me!

01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:43.489
That's exactly why
you should stay up here.

01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:46.001
Look, if you went down
in that garage and you got shot to death,

01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:47.321
you know how hurt I would be?

01:24:47.480 --> 01:24:49.130
I'd be super bummed out!
I don't want that.

01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:50.884
It's safer for you up here.

01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:52.929
If something happened up here,
what am I supposed to do, Bob?

01:24:53.080 --> 01:24:55.208
How do I get your attention?
Make a bird call?

01:24:57.520 --> 01:24:59.602
Does that sound like a bird to you? Huh?

01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:01.649
That's my biggest weakness!
I can't make bird noises.

01:25:01.800 --> 01:25:02.847
I never could.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:04.764
So if that's what
I gotta depend on to live,

01:25:04.920 --> 01:25:07.764
it means I'm gonna die!
I'mma die up here, by myself

01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:10.241
sounding like a dead-ass pigeon.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.606
- I have no idea what a pigeon...
- Jet, Jet, Jet, Jet, Jet!

01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:16.444
You don't have to make bird noises.

01:25:16.600 --> 01:25:17.601
You don't have to sound like a pigeon.

01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:22.609
All you gotta do is call me on
the encrypted phone that's in your hand.

01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:28.565
- Okay?
- Okay, yeah.

01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:30.405
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:31.761
All right?

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:33.206
Oh, Jet.

01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:36.404
I'll see you on the other side.

01:25:37.240 --> 01:25:38.241
Yeah.

01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:39.561
Yeah.

01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:06.801
You're early.

01:26:07.480 --> 01:26:09.084
So are you.

01:26:11.720 --> 01:26:13.085
Come on.

01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:25.091
Oh, my God!

01:26:28.920 --> 01:26:30.809
Oh, my God.

01:26:31.640 --> 01:26:32.641
I knew it.

01:26:32.800 --> 01:26:35.167
I knew it. I knew
she was The Black Badger!

01:26:35.320 --> 01:26:36.970
Oh, my God!

01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:39.608
Pick up the phone. Pick up the phone.

01:26:39.760 --> 01:26:40.761
Yello?

01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:43.566
Bob, Harris is The Black Badger!

01:26:43.760 --> 01:26:44.761
Hello?

01:26:45.120 --> 01:26:46.531
Harris is The Black Badger!

01:26:46.720 --> 01:26:47.767
I can't hear you.

01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:49.763
Harris is The Black Badger!

01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:53.646
Just kidding! I'm not here.
Leave a message at the beep.

01:26:53.800 --> 01:26:54.801
What?

01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:06.645
Oh. Harris is The Black Badger!

01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:08.450
Harris is The Black Badger!

01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:10.921
I knew it. I knew it.
Harris is The Black Badger!

01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:14.248
Bob! Harris is The...

01:27:15.720 --> 01:27:16.721
Who is he?

01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:18.161
That's my partner.

01:27:32.040 --> 01:27:33.610
I don't like splitting my fees.

01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:38.443
The package. Please.

01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:41.250
Thought you'd never ask.

01:27:41.480 --> 01:27:44.882
Wait! You're making a mistake.

01:27:46.440 --> 01:27:48.124
Hello, Bob.

01:27:49.800 --> 01:27:51.404
But you're dead.

01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:53.608
Not as much as people think.

01:27:54.360 --> 01:27:57.125
Look, he's not The Black Badger...

01:27:57.800 --> 01:27:58.801
I am.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.128
And those aren't the encryption codes,

01:28:01.280 --> 01:28:02.611
these are.

01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:03.886
He's lying to you.

01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:05.530
This man is a CIA agent,

01:28:05.880 --> 01:28:07.370
and he's trying to sell you bogus plans.

01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:15.767
Damn.

01:28:17.720 --> 01:28:19.051
Ow, ow.

01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:23.721
He shot me.

01:28:27.640 --> 01:28:29.802
These are the real codes

01:28:30.640 --> 01:28:32.244
and I am the real Black Badger.

01:28:36.360 --> 01:28:37.850
Bob is The Black Badger.

01:28:39.520 --> 01:28:40.681
Bob is The Black Badger.

01:28:40.840 --> 01:28:42.922
I am The Black Badger.

01:28:43.400 --> 01:28:44.606
Phil?

01:28:45.840 --> 01:28:48.411
No, I'm The Black Badger.

01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:51.564
I'm starting to think
I might be The Black Badger.

01:28:53.800 --> 01:28:55.450
Here's the thing.

01:28:55.640 --> 01:28:58.723
I have no idea
who is the real Black Badger.

01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:01.285
And I don't care.

01:29:01.480 --> 01:29:02.970
'Cause I'm The Honey Badger.

01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:05.043
And The Honey Badger doesn't give a shit.

01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:06.804
The Honey Badger's nasty.

01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:09.645
He's so nasty, he'll take them both.

01:29:10.160 --> 01:29:11.161
Hand them over.

01:29:11.720 --> 01:29:13.927
Phil, when this thing is over,

01:29:14.080 --> 01:29:18.130
I'm going to rip your throat out
like Patrick Swayze in Road House.

01:29:18.280 --> 01:29:19.645
Oh, my God. You and Road House.

01:29:19.800 --> 01:29:20.847
Get over that movie.

01:29:21.040 --> 01:29:22.769
It sucked then, it sucks now.

01:29:23.280 --> 01:29:24.611
Fuck Patrick Swayze!

01:29:25.600 --> 01:29:26.726
How dare you!

01:29:32.040 --> 01:29:33.451
Drop your weapons!

01:29:39.200 --> 01:29:40.247
Oh! Oh, shit!

01:29:52.560 --> 01:29:53.721
The codes.

01:29:54.120 --> 01:29:55.246
Don't do it.

01:29:55.880 --> 01:29:56.961
Stupid.

01:29:59.400 --> 01:30:00.401
Okay.

01:30:00.960 --> 01:30:02.007
One,

01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:04.041
two,

01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:06.401
three! Shit!

01:30:11.720 --> 01:30:13.404
Uh-oh! Oh!

01:30:13.920 --> 01:30:14.921
No!

01:30:15.400 --> 01:30:16.526
He's got the codes!

01:30:51.520 --> 01:30:52.521
Whoo!

01:30:52.960 --> 01:30:54.610
I mean, this is crazy, right?

01:30:54.960 --> 01:30:56.121
You stay the hell away from me, Bob!

01:30:56.280 --> 01:30:57.566
You shot me in the neck!

01:31:00.600 --> 01:31:01.601
Jet!

01:31:22.880 --> 01:31:23.927
Okay.

01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:30.482
Golden Jet for the win!

01:31:32.120 --> 01:31:33.645
No. Shit!

01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:35.205
Drop your weapon, Bob.

01:31:36.400 --> 01:31:37.401
Oh, shit!

01:31:37.560 --> 01:31:39.130
Get behind me, Mr. Joyner.

01:31:39.560 --> 01:31:40.925
Ah, you don't wanna do that, Jet.

01:31:41.160 --> 01:31:42.446
It's obvious he's the bad guy.

01:31:42.640 --> 01:31:44.085
I'm the good guy. You wanna get behind me.

01:31:44.240 --> 01:31:46.083
Agent Harris had me go dark

01:31:46.240 --> 01:31:49.323
to get Bob to reveal himself
as The Black Badger.

01:31:49.520 --> 01:31:51.124
You don't seriously
believe this guy, do you?

01:31:51.280 --> 01:31:52.441
You wanna get behind me, Jet.

01:31:52.600 --> 01:31:54.329
You betrayed your nation, Bob.

01:31:54.680 --> 01:31:57.001
You betrayed your partner, Phil.

01:31:57.160 --> 01:32:00.528
Okay, no, wait! Everybody just stop!

01:32:00.680 --> 01:32:01.727
Cut the shit!

01:32:02.280 --> 01:32:03.930
I'mma cut the line right now!

01:32:04.120 --> 01:32:05.485
I cut the shit!

01:32:05.640 --> 01:32:07.529
Hear me? Now I don't care
who betrayed who.

01:32:07.680 --> 01:32:09.125
Okay? I just don't wanna get hurt!

01:32:09.560 --> 01:32:12.086
So there ain't gonna be no... Shit!

01:32:20.960 --> 01:32:21.961
Come on.

01:32:37.840 --> 01:32:38.841
Shi...

01:32:43.520 --> 01:32:44.521
Shit.

01:33:03.240 --> 01:33:05.322
Smart move, Mr. Joyner.

01:33:05.480 --> 01:33:07.767
You've done your country a great service.

01:33:07.920 --> 01:33:10.127
Now, hand me the firearm

01:33:10.280 --> 01:33:13.523
and we'll turn over
the satellite codes together.

01:33:13.920 --> 01:33:17.527
Stay right there, man.
Don't you take another step.

01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:20.081
Just because I shot him
does not mean I trust you.

01:33:20.480 --> 01:33:21.641
We don't have time for this.

01:33:21.840 --> 01:33:24.605
Stop! I said, "Stop."

01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:27.124
Aw, whoopsie.

01:33:31.320 --> 01:33:33.368
Nice throw, bitch.

01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:42.608
You wanna know why your pal Bob
could never have been The Black Badger?

01:33:43.760 --> 01:33:45.888
It's because he's too weak.

01:33:46.040 --> 01:33:48.361
And if I had to hear
another goddamned story

01:33:48.520 --> 01:33:51.729
about Calvin "The Golden Jet" Joyner

01:33:51.880 --> 01:33:54.042
and how awesome you were in high school

01:33:54.200 --> 01:33:56.806
and how you were
this big idiot's best friend,

01:33:56.960 --> 01:33:58.485
I was just gonna lose it.

01:33:59.760 --> 01:34:03.082
Looking at you right now,
you don't seem so cool.

01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:06.727
You just seem like a regular guy.

01:34:07.160 --> 01:34:08.605
An everyday Joe.

01:34:09.480 --> 01:34:13.087
You know, faking my own death
was the easy part.

01:34:13.960 --> 01:34:17.248
But dealing with Bob, day after day,
was the hard part.

01:34:17.400 --> 01:34:18.401
Hey, Phil.

01:34:18.560 --> 01:34:19.641
What, Bob?

01:34:20.560 --> 01:34:22.403
I'll see you on the other side.

01:34:23.080 --> 01:34:25.401
No, I hope we don't. All right?

01:34:25.560 --> 01:34:27.130
Just, no. Bye, bye, bye.

01:34:27.280 --> 01:34:28.281
Just go.

01:34:28.440 --> 01:34:31.171
I made up the Black Badger,
rigged up a blood bag

01:34:31.320 --> 01:34:32.401
and that big dummy bought it.

01:34:32.640 --> 01:34:33.801
Bob!

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:35.923
No, no! Hang on, buddy.

01:34:36.520 --> 01:34:37.931
No, there's some sort of bomb in here.

01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:39.969
You're pushing it closed, I think.

01:34:40.120 --> 01:34:42.202
- No, no, no. Sorry.
- No, don't give up!

01:34:42.400 --> 01:34:43.401
Bye, Bob.

01:34:44.440 --> 01:34:46.761
I'm getting away with
a half a billion dollars.

01:34:46.920 --> 01:34:50.367
And Boy Scout Bob is gonna
spend his life in prison.

01:34:50.520 --> 01:34:52.124
Ain't America great?

01:34:52.920 --> 01:34:57.448
So now you're gonna be
the second partner of Bob's to die.

01:34:57.600 --> 01:34:58.601
Just relax.

01:34:58.760 --> 01:35:01.366
On your knees, Golden Jet.

01:35:11.080 --> 01:35:12.286
What the hell was that?

01:35:14.120 --> 01:35:15.770
Golden Jet flip.

01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:19.204
Yeah? Well, you really suck at it.

01:35:19.400 --> 01:35:20.640
I know.

01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:22.484
Then why'd you do it?

01:35:22.640 --> 01:35:23.641
Distraction.

01:35:27.680 --> 01:35:29.011
Oh, you just pulled his throat out!

01:35:31.480 --> 01:35:33.209
I'll see you on the other side.

01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:39.924
Jet, come here.
Give me your hand, old buddy.

01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:41.809
Oh, shit! Get that away from me!

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:43.161
Sorry, Jet.

01:35:44.200 --> 01:35:46.487
Come here, Jet. That was a trachea.

01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:48.165
Great distraction, man!

01:35:48.320 --> 01:35:49.765
Sorry I had to shoot you, Jet.

01:35:49.920 --> 01:35:51.649
It was the only way
I could save your life.

01:35:51.800 --> 01:35:54.007
But when you shot me
to get Phil to confess

01:35:54.160 --> 01:35:57.648
that he was The Black Badger,
that was some next-level-type shit!

01:35:57.800 --> 01:36:01.566
Yeah, no.
I'm glad you see it the way I saw it.

01:36:01.720 --> 01:36:03.688
That was my plan the whole time. So...

01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:05.524
You are a natural for this line of work.

01:36:05.680 --> 01:36:08.247
I mean, you're smart, you got
the skill set, you're a people person

01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:11.688
and you already got a dope-ass code name,
"The Golden Jet!" What?

01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:13.604
But in the meantime,
we gotta get those encryption codes

01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:15.683
over to Harris right away
or we're gonna be late.

01:36:15.840 --> 01:36:18.207
What are you talking about? Late for what?

01:36:20.200 --> 01:36:25.127
The reunion, dude. What-what!
This shit's on!

01:36:27.080 --> 01:36:29.048
Bob. Damn it.

01:36:52.560 --> 01:36:53.561
Bob!

01:36:53.720 --> 01:36:54.721
One more thing.

01:36:54.880 --> 01:36:56.484
Thanks for securing the satellite codes.

01:36:56.640 --> 01:36:58.165
You really saved my ass.

01:36:58.320 --> 01:36:59.401
Your country thanks you.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:00.842
Just doing my job.

01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:03.930
I'm really sorry about your hand.
I hope you know that wasn't personal.

01:37:04.080 --> 01:37:05.684
Oh, no hard feelings at all, Pam.

01:37:06.200 --> 01:37:07.690
Besides, everybody makes mistakes.

01:37:07.880 --> 01:37:09.882
Calvin, here, thought
you were The Black Badger.

01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:12.966
I don't... No, I don't think...

01:37:13.120 --> 01:37:15.441
When we were in the plane,
you said, "Hey, Harris is the Black..."

01:37:15.640 --> 01:37:17.404
I think you should... Maybe I...

01:37:17.800 --> 01:37:20.565
Mr. Joyner, it was a pleasure
working with you.

01:37:20.720 --> 01:37:23.451
If you ever want a career change,
you give me a call.

01:37:24.160 --> 01:37:26.367
If I were to give you a call,
how would I get in touch with you?

01:37:26.520 --> 01:37:28.363
Just pick up any phone in your house.

01:37:28.520 --> 01:37:29.646
They're all bugged.

01:37:31.320 --> 01:37:33.049
You're crazy. Hey, you're crazy!

01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:35.523
That's a good one.

01:37:35.680 --> 01:37:38.126
Calvin! I got your text
and came right over.

01:37:38.280 --> 01:37:41.409
Where the hell have you been?
Why did you get out of a helicopter?

01:37:41.840 --> 01:37:43.410
Hey, uh, Maggie.

01:37:43.560 --> 01:37:44.686
Uh, hi!

01:37:45.120 --> 01:37:46.724
Babe, why is Dr. Dan with you?

01:37:47.120 --> 01:37:48.167
Well... Uh...

01:37:48.520 --> 01:37:49.885
That's not Dr. Dan.

01:37:50.040 --> 01:37:52.327
Allow me to properly introduce myself.

01:37:52.480 --> 01:37:56.885
My name is Bob Stone, the artist
formerly known as Robbie Wheirdicht.

01:37:57.040 --> 01:37:58.087
I work for the CIA.

01:37:58.240 --> 01:38:00.242
I roped your husband
into helping me track down a traitor,

01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:03.210
who was gonna sell
military state secrets to a terrorist.

01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:07.208
We did all that, we stopped them,
we saved the free world, and here we are.

01:38:09.040 --> 01:38:10.405
What the hell is going on?

01:38:10.560 --> 01:38:12.210
Okay, listen, listen.

01:38:12.400 --> 01:38:14.402
I've been a fool. All right?

01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:16.562
I thought that my life was a failure.

01:38:16.720 --> 01:38:19.041
I thought that it wasn't special.
But it is special.

01:38:19.240 --> 01:38:21.083
It's special because I have you in it.

01:38:21.240 --> 01:38:24.403
You are my world.
You are what makes me special!

01:38:24.960 --> 01:38:27.122
You're everything to me, Mags.

01:38:27.280 --> 01:38:28.566
I love you.

01:38:29.240 --> 01:38:30.401
I love you.

01:38:35.080 --> 01:38:36.081
Okay.

01:38:37.240 --> 01:38:39.083
Here come the waterworks.

01:38:39.240 --> 01:38:41.242
I promised myself I wouldn't do this.

01:38:43.920 --> 01:38:45.763
- Come on, come on.
- Okay.

01:38:48.720 --> 01:38:50.449
- That's Robbie Wheirdicht?
- Yeah.

01:39:12.800 --> 01:39:14.006
- Hi, Brian.
- Hi, Gail.

01:39:14.160 --> 01:39:16.288
Guys, this isn't a good idea.
You know what?

01:39:16.440 --> 01:39:18.761
I'll just meet you later.
I shouldn't have come.

01:39:18.920 --> 01:39:19.921
Wait, wait, wait.

01:39:20.080 --> 01:39:23.129
Bob, calm down, okay? Listen to me.

01:39:23.280 --> 01:39:25.647
Tonight is not gonna be
how high school was for you 20 years ago.

01:39:25.800 --> 01:39:27.006
I promise.

01:39:27.160 --> 01:39:29.640
Attention, por favor.

01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:33.811
And now, for the moment
you've all been waiting for,

01:39:33.960 --> 01:39:38.522
tonight's vote for the reunion
homecoming king and queen!

01:39:38.680 --> 01:39:40.364
We'll announce the queen in one moment.

01:39:40.520 --> 01:39:42.966
But first, without further ado...

01:39:43.480 --> 01:39:45.323
The new homecoming king

01:39:45.480 --> 01:39:49.166
for the Central High School Centaurs,
Class of 1996 is...

01:39:49.480 --> 01:39:50.686
I really gotta pee, Jet.

01:39:50.840 --> 01:39:52.330
Bob Stone!

01:39:54.840 --> 01:39:56.410
Do we have a Bob Stone?

01:39:56.560 --> 01:39:58.881
Here he is, Bob Stone, huh!

01:39:59.600 --> 01:40:00.761
Yeah!

01:40:01.920 --> 01:40:03.888
Go on, get your rock-hard ass up there.

01:40:04.600 --> 01:40:05.601
For reals?

01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:07.922
For reals, for reals. Go ahead, man.

01:40:08.520 --> 01:40:09.521
Whoo!

01:40:09.760 --> 01:40:11.285
You did it, big guy!

01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:20.363
How did Bob Stone win homecoming king?

01:40:20.640 --> 01:40:22.927
I hacked into the votes on the flight in.

01:40:23.120 --> 01:40:26.090
Calvin Joyner, forensic accountant,
at your service.

01:40:27.440 --> 01:40:29.761
I had no idea you could do that.

01:40:30.520 --> 01:40:33.649
There's a lot of things
that you don't know about me, Maggie.

01:40:34.240 --> 01:40:35.401
No, scratch that I said that.

01:40:35.560 --> 01:40:37.130
It was supposed to
come out cool. It didn't.

01:40:37.280 --> 01:40:38.520
It was something I thought of,
it was like a...

01:40:38.680 --> 01:40:39.727
Forget it.

01:40:41.120 --> 01:40:42.963
Well, well, let's hear it for him!

01:40:43.120 --> 01:40:44.610
Fat Robbie made good.

01:40:44.760 --> 01:40:48.048
King Robbie Weird Dick, our naked mascot.

01:40:48.680 --> 01:40:50.250
Why don't you just
get out of the way, Trevor?

01:40:50.400 --> 01:40:51.731
Or what, Golden Jet?

01:40:51.880 --> 01:40:53.120
You're gonna hop up here
and punch me in the belt?

01:40:53.280 --> 01:40:54.406
Simmer down, Ant-Man.

01:40:54.560 --> 01:40:56.801
- You know what? That's it. That's it.
- It's okay.

01:40:56.960 --> 01:40:58.007
- It's all right.
- No, I've had it!

01:40:58.160 --> 01:40:59.764
- I got it, Jet. It's okay.
- It's okay.

01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:01.046
I'll handle it.

01:41:01.320 --> 01:41:05.245
Whoa, whoa! Hang on. I'm not buying
this whole transformation

01:41:05.400 --> 01:41:07.004
from ugly duckling into swan.

01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:08.201
No one in here is.

01:41:08.360 --> 01:41:11.807
You can fly in, in a bunch of helicopters
and dress up in a thousand suits,

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:15.607
but to everybody, including me,
you'll always just be the fat kid.

01:41:18.880 --> 01:41:20.291
I've been thinking
about this a lot, Trevor.

01:41:21.520 --> 01:41:24.761
And the only thing I want to say
to you is I forgive you.

01:41:25.320 --> 01:41:27.846
You forgive me! Oh, boy! For what?

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:29.525
For being rad as shit.

01:41:29.680 --> 01:41:30.886
Fuck you, fat boy.

01:41:31.080 --> 01:41:32.491
Still a scared little bitch.

01:41:36.800 --> 01:41:38.006
I don't like bullies.

01:41:41.800 --> 01:41:44.041
And the name is Bob Stone, bitch!

01:41:44.360 --> 01:41:45.361
Whoo-whoo!

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:47.411
Come on, baby. Step over.

01:41:51.360 --> 01:41:52.521
Hi, everybody!

01:41:53.480 --> 01:41:56.962
Most of you knew me back in high school as

01:41:57.920 --> 01:41:59.410
Robbie Wheirdicht.

01:41:59.600 --> 01:42:01.523
- That's Robbie Wheirdicht?
- No way!

01:42:01.680 --> 01:42:03.728
I wore prescription pants every day.

01:42:05.800 --> 01:42:08.041
Twenty years ago, in this gym,

01:42:09.240 --> 01:42:11.208
I stood in front of you all

01:42:12.040 --> 01:42:13.166
naked

01:42:13.880 --> 01:42:15.291
and embarrassed.

01:42:16.240 --> 01:42:18.163
Some of you might remember that day.

01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:21.488
A lot of you probably even laughed.

01:42:22.480 --> 01:42:24.130
But that's okay.

01:42:25.240 --> 01:42:27.846
Tonight's gonna be different because

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:31.083
my best friend is here with me.

01:42:33.240 --> 01:42:38.406
And he taught me what it means
to be the hero of your own story.

01:42:41.160 --> 01:42:42.525
Would you hold this for me, please?

01:42:44.240 --> 01:42:46.163
Being the hero of your own story

01:42:46.320 --> 01:42:50.689
isn't about stopping bad guys
or climbing mountains.

01:42:50.840 --> 01:42:53.969
It's about overcoming bullies
in your life,

01:42:54.120 --> 01:42:57.044
whatever or whomever they may be.

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.685
It's about putting it all out there

01:43:01.360 --> 01:43:02.407
for everyone

01:43:03.760 --> 01:43:04.921
to see.

01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:07.603
And it's realizing that, in life,

01:43:07.760 --> 01:43:10.127
the most important thing that you can be

01:43:11.240 --> 01:43:12.321
is yourself.

01:43:13.080 --> 01:43:17.404
So, Central High, Class of 1996,

01:43:18.360 --> 01:43:21.250
this is me, Robbie Wheirdicht.

01:43:32.520 --> 01:43:35.126
Oh, my God! Bob just went commando!

01:43:36.960 --> 01:43:38.564
Yes! Yes!

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:44.604
Way to go, Bob!

01:43:45.480 --> 01:43:46.720
Be you!

01:43:47.240 --> 01:43:49.322
Robbie! Robbie! Robbie!

01:43:49.480 --> 01:43:52.484
Robbie! Robbie! Robbie!

01:43:58.000 --> 01:43:59.161
Hey, man!

01:43:59.320 --> 01:44:01.527
Dude, this is amazing!
I'm so happy for you!

01:44:01.680 --> 01:44:03.409
Thank you, Jet! I feel so free!

01:44:03.920 --> 01:44:04.967
- Come here.
- No, no, no.

01:44:05.120 --> 01:44:06.884
Your junk is out.

01:44:07.240 --> 01:44:09.811
- Oh. Sorry, Jet.
- Excuse me.

01:44:12.240 --> 01:44:13.605
Hi, Robbie.

01:44:14.680 --> 01:44:16.762
- You probably don't remember me.
- Darla.

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.048
- Is that Darla McGuckian?
- Yeah.

01:44:20.200 --> 01:44:22.487
Wow! She looks great!

01:44:22.840 --> 01:44:24.205
Didn't she used to have a lazy eye?

01:44:24.400 --> 01:44:25.731
- Two of them.
- Wow.

01:44:25.880 --> 01:44:27.962
I can't believe you remember me.

01:44:28.120 --> 01:44:29.610
Remember you?

01:44:29.760 --> 01:44:31.330
How could I forget you?

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:35.800
You still have the same sweet smile,
the same sweet face.

01:44:36.360 --> 01:44:39.204
But your hair's changed.
You used to wear it curlier.

01:44:39.360 --> 01:44:40.600
I like it though.

01:44:41.040 --> 01:44:42.690
You haven't changed at all.

01:44:42.880 --> 01:44:44.405
Oh, I don't know.

01:44:50.520 --> 01:44:52.363
You're still as beautiful as ever.

01:44:52.680 --> 01:44:53.681
Oh.

01:45:03.040 --> 01:45:04.769
- Yeah, Bob!
- Go, Bob!

01:45:05.760 --> 01:45:07.250
No, no, no.

01:45:14.480 --> 01:45:16.562
Oh, I got spinny.

01:45:16.760 --> 01:45:18.569
Super spinny.

01:45:21.160 --> 01:45:22.969
Yeah, that's nice.

01:45:23.640 --> 01:45:26.405
- Can I take you to get ice-cream...
- Yes.

01:45:27.240 --> 01:45:29.242
Yes. Yes, yes, yes.

01:45:29.840 --> 01:45:32.844
Super lactose intolerant, but that's okay.
Let's roll the dice.

01:45:35.840 --> 01:45:36.841
That's my jam!

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:38.047
Go show them what you got.

01:45:38.240 --> 01:45:40.083
- All right, Darla.
- Okay.

01:45:40.400 --> 01:45:42.402
Darla, hi. Calvin.

01:45:42.600 --> 01:45:44.250
Hi, Colin. Nice to meet you.

01:45:44.840 --> 01:45:46.763
- Calvin.
- And Maggie.

01:45:46.920 --> 01:45:48.604
Maggie, hi!

01:45:48.760 --> 01:45:51.081
Hi. You look so good.

01:45:51.280 --> 01:45:53.601
- My gosh, you look the same.
- You do too.

01:45:53.760 --> 01:45:54.761
Oh, I don't know.

01:45:54.920 --> 01:45:57.048
You probably remember me
as The Golden Jet.

01:45:57.240 --> 01:45:59.846
Your name's Golden Jeff? Hi, Jeff.

01:46:00.600 --> 01:46:02.284
It's okay. Good to see you.

01:46:05.680 --> 01:46:08.126
- Good going, Bob!
- Come on, Bob!

01:46:23.840 --> 01:46:25.365
- All right.
- Good luck!

01:46:25.560 --> 01:46:26.800
- Love you.
- I love you.

01:46:26.960 --> 01:46:28.849
I love you, too, little Golden Jet!

01:46:31.520 --> 01:46:32.521
Mmm...

01:46:32.680 --> 01:46:33.761
Okay. Uh...

01:46:34.840 --> 01:46:36.410
How long do you think he's been there?

01:46:37.160 --> 01:46:38.969
Hmm, probably since last night.

01:46:39.560 --> 01:46:40.971
All right, babe, I'll see you later.

01:46:41.160 --> 01:46:42.889
Have fun with your friend!

01:46:48.480 --> 01:46:49.481
Who, me?

01:46:49.640 --> 01:46:50.926
Yes, you.

01:47:00.120 --> 01:47:01.451
Wow, Jet!

01:47:01.640 --> 01:47:03.324
You look amazing!

01:47:03.520 --> 01:47:05.284
- Do you think?
- Oh, what? Yes!

01:47:05.480 --> 01:47:08.521
I just didn't know the kind of look
to go for on my first day at the agency.

01:47:08.680 --> 01:47:10.728
You look like a black Will Smith,
or something.

01:47:10.920 --> 01:47:13.807
Okay, I'm not sure if that's racist
or not, but I'll take it as a compliment.

01:47:13.960 --> 01:47:15.371
All right, cool. Yeah, come on!

01:47:15.520 --> 01:47:16.681
Okay.

01:47:17.320 --> 01:47:18.526
All right. Don't be nervous.

01:47:18.680 --> 01:47:20.444
You are gonna do great.
They're gonna love you!

01:47:20.600 --> 01:47:22.011
Oh, Jet, Jet, Jet!

01:47:22.200 --> 01:47:23.326
Um, before we go, man, uh...

01:47:24.760 --> 01:47:25.886
I got a surprise for you.

01:47:27.120 --> 01:47:29.043
Okay. What's the surprise?

01:47:29.200 --> 01:47:31.851
Well, you gotta close your eyes first.

01:47:33.520 --> 01:47:34.681
Eyes are closed.

01:47:34.880 --> 01:47:35.881
No peeking.

01:47:41.360 --> 01:47:42.521
Open your eyes.

01:47:46.840 --> 01:47:49.207
Is that my... Is that my jacket?

01:47:49.360 --> 01:47:50.407
Yes!

01:47:50.560 --> 01:47:52.562
- Bob, is that my jacket?
- Yes!

01:47:52.720 --> 01:47:54.165
- No, wait a minute.
- Yes!

01:47:54.360 --> 01:47:56.044
Oh, my God!

01:47:56.400 --> 01:47:57.526
Dude, where'd you get this from?

01:47:57.680 --> 01:48:01.321
Well, I sleep in it most nights,
but it's clean now, totally good. Yeah!

01:48:01.480 --> 01:48:04.086
Man! You are the man! Yes!

01:48:04.240 --> 01:48:07.130
- Family hug! What?
- Ooh. Okay.

01:48:09.200 --> 01:48:10.326
All right, let's go!

01:48:10.480 --> 01:48:11.811
- Okay.
- All right.

01:48:26.200 --> 01:48:28.168
You still ride?

01:48:28.680 --> 01:48:30.921
Cut! The fire department's here.

01:48:31.200 --> 01:48:33.601
All right. That's our cue, guys!

01:48:34.520 --> 01:48:36.249
Here we are shooting Central Intelligence.

01:48:36.440 --> 01:48:38.363
They shut us down.
The fire trucks are out here.

01:48:38.520 --> 01:48:40.204
- Shut the fuck up!
- Will you get the fuck out of my video?

01:48:40.360 --> 01:48:41.361
I'mma slap the dogshit out of you.

01:48:41.520 --> 01:48:42.521
Why do you do your video behind me?

01:48:42.680 --> 01:48:43.886
- I'm trying to do my video!
- This is my video!

01:48:44.040 --> 01:48:45.530
- You're in my fucking video!
- I'm pissed off.

01:48:45.680 --> 01:48:47.170
Watch your mouth,
I'll slap the shit out of you.

01:48:47.320 --> 01:48:48.321
Fuck you!

01:48:49.280 --> 01:48:51.806
Okay. You have it your way.

01:48:52.760 --> 01:48:54.762
You leave me no choice.

01:48:56.040 --> 01:48:57.041
Pam...

01:48:58.360 --> 01:48:59.361
Tickler! Tickler!

01:48:59.520 --> 01:49:02.046
Where are the codes? Where are the codes?

01:49:03.040 --> 01:49:04.530
It's just nice.

01:49:06.200 --> 01:49:08.771
In here and it's kind of all...

01:49:10.280 --> 01:49:11.691
- Oh, my God.
- Sorry.

01:49:16.280 --> 01:49:17.645
- Can you do both?
- Yeah.

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:19.126
Oh, my God!

01:49:22.360 --> 01:49:24.169
It's called "soul gazing."

01:49:24.320 --> 01:49:27.881
Stare into my soul
and I'll stare into yours.

01:49:28.080 --> 01:49:29.525
- Come in. Shh.
- You're not my wife!

01:49:29.680 --> 01:49:31.091
Oh, that's it.

01:49:32.960 --> 01:49:34.371
- Bob, I'm gonna...
- Shh.

01:49:35.480 --> 01:49:36.720
I promise you'll never...

01:49:38.160 --> 01:49:39.844
Let's keep on, keep on.

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:41.047
Okay, for real this time.

01:49:42.160 --> 01:49:44.162
It's for real.
This is for real, guys, yeah.

01:49:44.680 --> 01:49:45.806
- That's it!
- Oh.

01:49:45.960 --> 01:49:47.485
One more. Come on.

01:49:47.680 --> 01:49:48.806
- I can't do this, I'm not...
- Shh.

01:49:48.960 --> 01:49:51.645
Oh, my God. I've fucking had it.

01:49:51.800 --> 01:49:52.801
Lock it! We're professionals.

01:49:52.960 --> 01:49:54.769
- This is what we do. You ready?
- Come on, baby!

01:49:54.920 --> 01:49:56.649
I'm gonna hit you. I told you!

01:49:56.800 --> 01:49:58.006
Fuck!

01:49:59.960 --> 01:50:00.961
Are you not a super tool?

01:50:01.120 --> 01:50:03.407
You're not even Robbie Wheirdicht.
You're Bob Stone!

01:50:04.120 --> 01:50:05.645
- I made that name up.
- So what?

01:50:05.800 --> 01:50:07.290
- It's not real.
- What does that mean?

01:50:07.440 --> 01:50:11.331
What, you think Mr. T and Sting

01:50:11.480 --> 01:50:12.720
and The Rock...

01:50:12.880 --> 01:50:14.370
You think those guys are real?

01:50:14.520 --> 01:50:17.524
That's a bunch of dumbass nicknames
by a bunch of dumbass people.

01:56:02.720 --> 01:56:04.006
Fanny!
