00:03.680 --> 00:06.800
Attention, ladies,
the upholsterer is in town.

00:06.960 --> 00:09.120
We upholster
all kinds of sofas.

00:18.120 --> 00:20.120
The apartment
is 645 square feet.

00:22.840 --> 00:25.160
It looks out onto the street
but it's very quiet.

00:28.800 --> 00:31.880
The views aren't spectacular,
but it's very bright.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.240
It's fine, I'll take it.

00:34.200 --> 00:36.480
-Don't you want to see the rest?
-No.

00:36.680 --> 00:38.520
I'll need two months' security.

00:41.080 --> 00:43.440
-No problem.
-Your face seems familiar.

00:48.040 --> 00:51.400
So you'll just want a standard
one-year contract, right?

00:51.560 --> 00:54.000
I'll pay the full year
but I won't need it.

00:54.560 --> 00:56.800
Let the doorman know
when you're moving in.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.040
I don't need furniture.

00:59.080 --> 01:00.880
Why do you want the apartment?

01:01.760 --> 01:02.760
I'm a writer.

01:04.080 --> 01:06.520
Well, if you need any ideas,
you come to me.

01:06.680 --> 01:08.040
I have plenty, thanks.

01:11.160 --> 01:12.160
Alright.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.640
Sol. Are you taking a shower?

02:48.880 --> 02:50.000
Hang on.

02:50.200 --> 02:51.160
Wait up, dammit.

02:51.280 --> 02:52.400
What are you doing?

02:53.040 --> 02:54.160
Hold up, man.

03:02.760 --> 03:03.960
Goddammit.

03:05.040 --> 03:06.040
What's wrong?

03:07.960 --> 03:09.960
I can't. I can't do this.

03:12.440 --> 03:13.440
Damn...

03:14.040 --> 03:15.640
You should buy a new bed.

03:17.160 --> 03:20.000
-We could finish on the floor.
-Yeah, right.

03:21.160 --> 03:24.320
My husband would ask me
about the carpet burn.

03:24.480 --> 03:27.040
-He thinks I'm at spin class.
-Jesus.

03:27.840 --> 03:30.640
I thought my bad day
couldn't start worse.

03:33.480 --> 03:34.880
Come on, quit complaining.

03:36.240 --> 03:38.920
This is how it always is
with my husband.

03:39.120 --> 03:41.080
I don't get
why you're still with him.

03:42.080 --> 03:44.640
Well...
there's more to life than sex.

03:46.560 --> 03:47.680
I have you for that.

03:48.720 --> 03:52.720
-Besides, he's a great cook.
-I'm not exactly a chef.

03:54.840 --> 03:55.840
What about you?

03:56.760 --> 03:57.960
What about me?

03:58.920 --> 04:01.240
-How is the case going?
-Nice try.

04:02.520 --> 04:04.880
How many times
have we been through this?

04:05.040 --> 04:07.080
It's a reporter's job
to ask questions.

04:07.080 --> 04:07.120
It's a reporter's job
to ask questions.
It's a cop's not to answer.
Two years without saying a peep.

04:07.120 --> 04:10.360
It's a cop's not to answer.
Two years without saying a peep.

04:12.120 --> 04:13.960
I ask the questions here, okay?

04:19.960 --> 04:22.480
...after the Parot doctrine
was overturned.

04:22.960 --> 04:26.000
ETA's Alain Basauri,
AKA "Txipi," was freed today,

04:26.160 --> 04:28.520
-architect of a dozen attacks.
-Unbelievable.

04:28.720 --> 04:30.720
-His most famous attack...
-Damn.

04:30.840 --> 04:33.360
-...was a car bomb...
-I should have said infamous.

04:34.320 --> 04:37.040
Do you have a message
for the victims' families?

04:37.760 --> 04:41.560
Mr. Basauri, how does it feel
to be protected by the law?

05:04.800 --> 05:07.280
How's it going, gorgeous?
Good morning.

05:08.760 --> 05:09.760
Hello.

05:12.160 --> 05:13.160
Yes?

05:14.520 --> 05:16.280
I'm here to pay for room seven.

05:16.440 --> 05:18.080
How long, a couple of hours?

05:19.120 --> 05:20.200
A week.

05:20.680 --> 05:22.120
I'll pay weekly.

05:22.320 --> 05:25.440
Sheets get changed biweekly,
this ain't the Ritz.

05:37.080 --> 05:38.240
They're clean.

05:38.360 --> 05:41.000
It's just some stains
are hard to get rid of.

05:42.320 --> 05:43.320
It's fine.

05:55.160 --> 05:56.160
Hi.

06:00.520 --> 06:01.520
How did you sleep?

06:02.440 --> 06:03.440
Not great.

06:04.080 --> 06:06.000
I can't get used to it.

06:06.480 --> 06:07.480
I can imagine.

06:08.600 --> 06:10.000
Everything's taken care of.

06:11.080 --> 06:13.480
-I brought you all you need.
-Thank you.

06:22.160 --> 06:24.640
I'm delivering groceries
for apartment 6A.

06:26.680 --> 06:27.680
Come this way, please.

07:06.080 --> 07:12.040
GAS METER READINGS
TO BE TAKEN TODAY.

07:17.640 --> 07:21.720
Tell them I review every form
we send to the IRS.

07:22.040 --> 07:24.040
That's not
why they're here, Dad.

07:28.440 --> 07:29.520
Hello.

07:30.840 --> 07:34.440
All our costumes and accessories
are at the end of this aisle.

07:34.600 --> 07:35.840
Shall we?

07:36.440 --> 07:39.680
We need this specific model,
we were told you import it.

07:40.680 --> 07:42.000
Yes, it's a great model.

07:44.400 --> 07:45.400
This one.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
They're identical.

07:47.280 --> 07:50.440
-They're at the back.
-How many do you sell a year?

07:52.080 --> 07:55.000
-About 10,200.
-Very good. Good sales.

07:55.120 --> 07:57.160
Do you sell more
during Halloween or Carnival?

07:58.080 --> 08:01.080
What is this?
Market research or police work?

08:01.560 --> 08:02.680
We're past Halloween.

08:02.840 --> 08:05.040
Fewer mask sales,
fewer suspects.

08:05.200 --> 08:07.240
-I know what I'm doing.
-Watch your tone.

08:07.400 --> 08:11.160
If it were up to me,
I'd let him kill them all.

08:12.080 --> 08:15.040
The law is the law.
Our opinions don't matter.

08:15.480 --> 08:16.960
"The law is the law".

08:17.520 --> 08:19.240
Like you've had an opinion
that wasn't fed to you.

08:20.080 --> 08:22.000
Have you thought
about the victims?

08:22.000 --> 08:24.040
Can you imagine
what the families of those

08:24.160 --> 08:28.480
who were killed and raped
are going through?

08:28.600 --> 08:30.680
You're a damn robot.

08:54.240 --> 08:55.240
How do I look?

08:56.400 --> 08:57.360
Be honest.

08:58.600 --> 09:00.640
-You look gorgeous.
-Really?

09:00.840 --> 09:01.840
Yes.

09:02.360 --> 09:03.360
Alright.

09:04.480 --> 09:05.960
-Wait a sec.
-What?

09:10.360 --> 09:12.280
-Right, lift up your hair.
-What? No.

09:12.440 --> 09:14.240
-Come on.
-Mom, I'm not getting married.

09:14.440 --> 09:16.520
-It's not my wedding.
-It'll make me happy.

09:16.720 --> 09:17.880
-Alright.
-Let's see...

09:19.680 --> 09:22.400
-There.
-It's beautiful. I love it.

09:22.520 --> 09:26.840
-It's gorgeous, isn't it?
-It is. It really is, I love it.

09:28.440 --> 09:31.720
-Sure you don't want a lift?
-No, it's fine.

09:31.840 --> 09:33.360
It's just Alicia's place.

09:33.560 --> 09:36.480
I'm nervous.
It's my first party.

09:36.600 --> 09:38.040
Don't worry.

09:38.400 --> 09:40.040
There'll be plenty more.

09:40.040 --> 09:42.000
-I hope so.
-You'll see.

09:43.080 --> 09:44.000
Have a good time.

09:44.160 --> 09:46.440
-I love you.
-Love you too.

09:46.640 --> 09:47.640
Hello?

09:48.160 --> 09:49.320
-Here's the list.
-Sorry.

09:49.480 --> 09:51.880
The list of stores
that sell the mask.

09:52.440 --> 09:54.200
-Thanks.
-I'll walk you out.

09:58.520 --> 10:00.440
The meter's
under the kitchen window.

10:00.560 --> 10:01.560
Okay.

10:07.120 --> 10:10.240
-Okay, that's the last one.
-Great. See you next month.

10:11.520 --> 10:12.600
See you later.

11:11.760 --> 11:13.680
I'm on the way, yes.

11:14.440 --> 11:19.000
Hey, I don't want a fuss.
Tell the gang, alright?

11:39.040 --> 11:43.160
Warning, this is Diesel Extra.

12:04.360 --> 12:07.120
There are 260 stores that sell
the mask in Madrid.

12:07.120 --> 12:07.160
There are 260 stores that sell
the mask in Madrid.
-What a pain.
-That's great news.

12:07.160 --> 12:09.040
-What a pain.
-That's great news.

12:09.040 --> 12:09.120
-What a pain.
-That's great news.
Do you know how long it'll take
to check them all?

12:09.120 --> 12:11.960
Do you know how long it'll take
to check them all?

12:12.120 --> 12:16.000
130 for you, 130 for me.
A full week apart, minimum.

12:17.160 --> 12:18.480
Yes. Excuse me a moment.

12:19.040 --> 12:20.960
-He's struck again.
-Who's the victim?

12:21.080 --> 12:23.440
A member of ETA.
He's conscious in hospital,

12:23.600 --> 12:26.000
so hotfoot it down there
and take a statement.

12:27.120 --> 12:29.000
Yes, sorry. Go on!

12:35.200 --> 12:36.800
They're just treating him.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.560
-He'll be right out.
-Thanks.

12:40.560 --> 12:42.320
That's how the system works.

12:43.120 --> 12:46.120
Wasting public health resources
where they shouldn't.

12:46.240 --> 12:47.960
You're like a broken record.

12:48.920 --> 12:51.280
The same thing over and over.

12:51.560 --> 12:54.000
Having to work with you
is bad enough,

12:54.440 --> 12:57.560
without having to endure your
anti-systemic rants all day.

13:01.120 --> 13:02.120
National Police.

13:03.120 --> 13:04.720
-You're a bit late.
-Well.

13:06.080 --> 13:07.920
We're here to take a statement.

13:09.560 --> 13:13.000
We need information to
identify your attacker.

13:13.200 --> 13:15.040
Height, complexion, accent...

13:15.200 --> 13:16.200
I saw his face.

13:18.040 --> 13:21.240
-Was he wearing a monkey mask?
-No, his face was exposed.

13:22.080 --> 13:23.400
Can you describe him?

13:24.280 --> 13:26.280
Graying hair, scruffy beard.

13:27.440 --> 13:31.000
About 5'11'', green eyes.
He had a mole on his cheek.

13:31.480 --> 13:33.000
You don't miss a trick.

13:33.160 --> 13:35.640
Shame you decided to be
a terrorist and not a cop.

13:35.800 --> 13:37.080
Is he one of these?

13:38.400 --> 13:40.520
-This one.
-Sure?

13:43.600 --> 13:44.720
Juan Martín.

13:45.360 --> 13:47.200
His wife died in the attack
on the mall.

13:47.360 --> 13:48.800
She was
seven months pregnant.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.880
I want to bring
charges against him.

13:52.200 --> 13:56.080
After what you did to him?
The nerve...

13:56.600 --> 14:00.040
-I've paid my dues.
-I'm not filing a report.

14:00.120 --> 14:01.120
This isn't over.

14:06.080 --> 14:07.080
Receiving.

14:16.920 --> 14:17.920
Stop right there!

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
Freeze!

14:20.160 --> 14:23.040
You're under arrest
for assaulting Alain Basauri!

14:34.960 --> 14:36.280
Is this bastard going to show?

14:37.160 --> 14:39.560
I wouldn't come out
if I had a house like his.

14:39.960 --> 14:42.400
-My knees are sore.
-Come on, don't be lame.

14:43.080 --> 14:44.000
It'll be worth the wait.

14:44.760 --> 14:46.160
He'll give us
a reason to celebrate.

14:46.600 --> 14:48.120
You'll see.

14:49.880 --> 14:50.880
He's coming.

14:51.560 --> 14:53.800
-He's coming out, run! Go on.
-Let's go.

14:54.160 --> 14:55.320
Please!

14:55.480 --> 14:57.560
We just want to ask you
some questions.

14:58.120 --> 14:59.720
-Good morning.
-Morning.

14:59.880 --> 15:02.200
How do think your 12 victims
are feeling now?

15:02.360 --> 15:04.000
-It was 12 girls, right?
-Sorry...

15:04.200 --> 15:06.320
Some were minors.
Why did you do it?

15:06.520 --> 15:09.560
-Sorry, I have nothing to say.
-You were rich, successful.

15:09.720 --> 15:13.440
-Why ruin those girls' lives?
-Would you let me speak, please?

15:13.640 --> 15:15.160
-Of course.
-Good.

15:16.520 --> 15:19.720
I comprehend the interest in me
and the nature of your work,

15:19.920 --> 15:21.640
-but I won't comment.
-You must...

15:21.800 --> 15:23.400
I'm asking you
to respect my privacy.

15:25.040 --> 15:27.880
I plan to enjoy my freedom
with total discretion.

15:28.840 --> 15:29.880
Thank you.

15:42.560 --> 15:45.040
Put it together right
and there's a good cut.

15:45.360 --> 15:46.840
That's it. Right.

15:47.160 --> 15:48.760
Make it look
like he lost his cool.

15:49.120 --> 15:53.120
Okay? Right, yes, great.
Chat later, ciao.

16:17.320 --> 16:18.400
Goddammit.

16:20.320 --> 16:21.880
-It won't stick.
-No.

16:22.640 --> 16:26.240
You should have bought new glue.
You should do things properly.

16:26.440 --> 16:29.560
I know, Mom. There's a lot
I should have done and haven't,

16:29.680 --> 16:31.240
so let's not get into...

16:32.040 --> 16:33.040
Right, come on.

16:35.200 --> 16:37.720
You didn't sleep a wink
last night, did you?

16:37.920 --> 16:40.240
Here we go.
I don't want a therapist.

16:41.040 --> 16:42.880
You choose, therapist or mother.

16:43.200 --> 16:44.240
I won't ignore it.

16:44.400 --> 16:47.000
I can see in your face
what you're going through.

16:47.120 --> 16:50.080
I won't discuss this anymore.
It's in the past.

16:50.280 --> 16:51.360
Period.

16:52.040 --> 16:54.120
You could prescribe me
some tranquilizers.

16:54.320 --> 16:55.600
No way.

16:56.240 --> 16:59.040
You're fine, but you need pills?
Makes sense.

16:59.040 --> 16:59.080
You're fine, but you need pills?
Makes sense.
-Where are the nails?
-Nails? A thumbtack will do.

16:59.080 --> 17:02.120
-Where are the nails?
-Nails? A thumbtack will do.

17:02.120 --> 17:04.720
-I don't have thumbtacks.
-Isabel, look...

17:06.520 --> 17:10.000
You don't have to talk to me.
I can recommend someone.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.840
I don't want to bring up
the stuff we went through.

17:13.440 --> 17:16.520
Crap doesn't go anywhere
until you clean it.

17:16.680 --> 17:17.760
That's a good tagline.

17:17.880 --> 17:20.400
Call a company,
they might make you rich.

17:21.960 --> 17:23.000
The door!

17:29.440 --> 17:31.920
-Happy Saints' Day.
-Happy Saint's Day, honey.

17:33.360 --> 17:34.360
Thanks, Grandma.

17:39.720 --> 17:42.000
We'll have
the cake tonight, okay?

17:42.160 --> 17:45.480
I'll pick it up after work.
We can celebrate here.

17:46.000 --> 17:50.120
What's there to celebrate?
Seems like a waste of time...

17:51.920 --> 17:55.200
Well... you should have seen us
with the banner.

17:55.320 --> 17:58.840
Your mom wanted to surprise you
but it was impossible.

18:03.400 --> 18:06.120
I have something for you.
I think you'll like it.

18:24.040 --> 18:26.880
-What's taking so long?
-It's not here, it's gone.

18:27.520 --> 18:30.160
-Maybe it's somewhere else.
-No, I put it here.

18:30.320 --> 18:32.040
I left it here this morning.

18:32.200 --> 18:33.640
See what happens
when you don't sleep?

18:33.800 --> 18:35.680
You're all over the place.

18:36.640 --> 18:37.960
-Did you take it?
-Me?

18:38.120 --> 18:39.600
-Yes.
-What are you on about?

18:39.720 --> 18:41.920
First you hit me,
now you call me a thief.

18:42.080 --> 18:44.600
-Great.
-Enough, let's calm down.

18:44.720 --> 18:46.840
Maybe you left it
in a cupboard...

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
No, I put it here.

18:49.640 --> 18:50.680
Goddammit.

18:59.280 --> 19:01.440
-He's identical.
-That proves nothing.

19:02.080 --> 19:03.600
Get in there and do your job.

19:08.800 --> 19:09.800
Take the mask off.

19:13.400 --> 19:14.480
Help him.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.320
You can leave now.

19:25.600 --> 19:26.920
Come and sit down.

19:35.080 --> 19:36.080
Well.

19:37.240 --> 19:40.040
So far, we have you for assault
and attacking an officer.

19:40.040 --> 19:40.080
So far, we have you for assault
and attacking an officer.
That's nothing.
You're wanted for two murders.

19:40.080 --> 19:43.160
That's nothing.
You're wanted for two murders.

19:44.200 --> 19:45.640
It wasn't me.

19:46.920 --> 19:49.040
If I got a dollar every time
I heard that,

19:49.160 --> 19:51.080
I'd be living it up
in the Caribbean.

19:51.080 --> 19:53.920
There's a dollar in the corner
to get you started.

19:54.840 --> 19:57.440
One of the cops dropped it,
didn't even realize.

19:59.160 --> 20:00.720
The Caribbean is real nice.

20:00.920 --> 20:03.760
They gave us these bracelets
on our honeymoon there,

20:04.240 --> 20:06.000
we could eat whenever we wanted.

20:06.160 --> 20:08.960
There are these weird turtles
with beaked mouths.

20:09.080 --> 20:12.800
What are you talking about?
Don't you understand?

20:13.800 --> 20:16.360
You just decimated the guy
who killed your family...

20:16.560 --> 20:19.360
There are two unsolved murders
and you're a perfect fit.

20:20.680 --> 20:23.040
-Yes, I get it.
-You wouldn't know it.

20:23.920 --> 20:25.600
Stop talking about turtles

20:26.560 --> 20:28.440
and how great
your life was before

20:29.160 --> 20:32.120
and focus on now,
because you're pretty screwed.

20:32.920 --> 20:36.080
-Give me something to go on.
-I've got nothing.

20:37.400 --> 20:39.800
I've thought about
how I'd do it for 20 years.

20:40.960 --> 20:42.280
Planning what I'd say to him.

20:43.480 --> 20:44.480
How I'd kill him.

20:45.760 --> 20:46.960
Whether it'd be quick

20:47.840 --> 20:49.080
or if I'd make him suffer.

20:51.120 --> 20:52.760
It's all that kept me going.

20:55.080 --> 20:56.640
But I felt nothing.

20:58.280 --> 21:00.920
It was as if
I were beating on someone else.

21:03.280 --> 21:06.040
They told me
it'd get easier in time.

21:07.480 --> 21:09.000
But that's not true.

21:11.960 --> 21:14.000
The pain and anger
are always there.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
The check, please.

21:50.920 --> 21:52.040
WON'T BE HOME FOR DINNER.

21:52.200 --> 21:54.760
I'M WITH LUCÍA,
HER PARENTS ARE TAKING ME OUT.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.400
No, give me another one.

22:00.360 --> 22:01.360
Make it two.

22:01.560 --> 22:02.600
It's on me.

22:05.880 --> 22:07.280
Best part of the day, right?

22:08.680 --> 22:10.160
And I'll bet you've earned it.

22:11.440 --> 22:13.400
Sorry, I'd rather be left alone.

22:14.880 --> 22:16.200
You seem tense.

22:18.560 --> 22:20.360
-Stressed out at work?
-No.

22:22.320 --> 22:23.960
I asked to be left alone.

22:25.320 --> 22:26.560
What part don't you get?

22:30.800 --> 22:31.920
Fair enough.

22:33.880 --> 22:35.200
Unpleasant girl.

22:47.480 --> 22:48.640
-Sorry.
-I told you...

22:49.160 --> 22:50.440
-Your bag fell off.
-Sorry.

22:50.640 --> 22:53.640
-I'm sorry. Sorry, I apologize.
-No problem.

22:55.040 --> 22:56.680
-Goodnight
-Goodnight.

23:13.200 --> 23:14.200
Crap.

23:30.160 --> 23:32.560
If you're throwing it out,
I'll take it.

23:32.760 --> 23:33.880
Knock yourself out.

23:35.040 --> 23:37.000
-Is it chocolate?
-Sorry?

23:37.640 --> 23:38.920
Is it chocolate?

24:00.840 --> 24:01.840
Goddammit.

25:09.600 --> 25:11.000
Move away from the glass.

25:23.120 --> 25:24.960
You were very brave, Isabel.

25:25.640 --> 25:28.880
Thanks to your report,
we found other girls

25:29.080 --> 25:31.760
who had been drugged and raped

25:32.280 --> 25:34.040
but didn't remember
their attacker.

25:37.080 --> 25:40.480
His house was full of photos
and belongings of you all.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.440
He collected you,
as if you were trophies.

25:47.160 --> 25:48.160
Isabel.

25:48.640 --> 25:52.680
I need one last push from you,
so we can send him to jail.

25:55.520 --> 25:57.200
-Are you ready?
-I want to leave.

25:57.400 --> 25:58.800
-No...
-Isabel, wait.

25:59.040 --> 26:00.040
Hang on.

26:00.680 --> 26:03.520
If you'd like to go get some air
you can come back.

26:03.680 --> 26:05.560
-Yes, later.
-No. No!

26:05.760 --> 26:06.760
Now.

26:08.120 --> 26:11.160
That man needs to pay
for what he's done to you.

26:11.360 --> 26:13.160
You and the other girls.

26:14.320 --> 26:16.400
It's just a second.
You must be strong.

26:17.160 --> 26:19.040
Only you can bring him
to justice.

26:22.080 --> 26:23.080
Okay.

26:39.160 --> 26:41.120
Hands down, look straight ahead.

26:57.360 --> 26:58.520
Is that him?

26:59.520 --> 27:01.360
-Is this the man who raped you?
-Yes.

27:01.480 --> 27:03.000
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

27:03.640 --> 27:04.640
Yes.

27:10.520 --> 27:12.040
Yes.

27:12.480 --> 27:13.960
You can take him away.

28:27.760 --> 28:29.120
Day 12, Tuesday.

28:29.320 --> 28:31.000
I went to see him today.

28:32.640 --> 28:34.600
I've decided
to keep him isolated.

28:34.800 --> 28:37.400
He's suffering with anxiety
and guilt disorder.

28:40.160 --> 28:41.920
He's entirely dependent on me.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.520
-Hi.
-What's up?

28:59.680 --> 29:03.080
I can't find my keys.
I looked for them, but...

29:03.080 --> 29:03.120
I can't find my keys.
I looked for them, but...
I can't find them.
Let's not make a big deal of it.

29:03.120 --> 29:05.840
I can't find them.
Let's not make a big deal of it.

29:05.960 --> 29:09.240
-I'll just take your key.
-How did you lose them?

29:09.440 --> 29:11.000
Maybe I dropped them,
it happens.

29:11.160 --> 29:13.880
You couldn't find Sol's gift
this morning either.

29:14.600 --> 29:18.240
Everything's been
misplaced today.

29:18.400 --> 29:20.240
Hey, what's that on your sleeve?

29:20.880 --> 29:21.960
Chocolate.

29:23.400 --> 29:25.960
It must have happened
when I dropped the cake.

29:26.920 --> 29:29.800
It doesn't matter anyway,
my daughter thinks I'm the worst

29:29.960 --> 29:32.280
so some bum is enjoying
the cake as we speak.

29:35.400 --> 29:36.400
I knew it.

29:37.000 --> 29:40.080
I knew if I came for the keys
you'd look at me like that.

29:40.520 --> 29:41.880
And here we are again.

29:44.000 --> 29:45.120
Why don't you sit down?

29:45.320 --> 29:47.160
-On the couch? No way.
-No.

29:47.160 --> 29:48.640
Not on the damn couch.

29:48.800 --> 29:51.120
In a chair,
while I go find your keys.

29:51.640 --> 29:52.640
Okay.

30:17.600 --> 30:18.600
Is this your dinner?

30:19.400 --> 30:20.360
Crap...

30:20.520 --> 30:24.080
Hey... Why don't you and Sol
come stay for a few days?

30:24.080 --> 30:24.120
Hey... Why don't you and Sol
come stay for a few days?
No.

30:24.120 --> 30:25.240
No.

30:26.120 --> 30:28.880
I'm an adult,
I have my own life.

30:29.040 --> 30:31.400
-You can't always protect me.
-Of course I can.

30:31.560 --> 30:33.000
You can't, that's the problem.

30:33.200 --> 30:36.920
I don't know where I end
and you begin. You're...

30:38.680 --> 30:39.680
You're like...

30:40.760 --> 30:42.000
You're like chocolate.

30:42.760 --> 30:43.760
That's stuck.

30:44.040 --> 30:45.520
You're always stuck to me.

30:46.440 --> 30:48.520
And I'm fine. I'm pretty happy.

30:49.480 --> 30:52.320
-It's just keys and a gift.
-Sure.

30:52.480 --> 30:54.080
-You're happy?
-Yes.

30:54.280 --> 30:56.240
You've never had
a healthy relationship

30:56.360 --> 30:57.840
with a man in your life.

30:58.760 --> 31:02.000
This is a great time
to talk about my sex life.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.520
I'm not talking about sex.

31:03.720 --> 31:06.280
-I'm talking about feelings.
-Mom, that's enough.

31:06.960 --> 31:07.960
I don't care.

31:09.040 --> 31:11.680
You're like
a vulture circling its prey.

31:23.400 --> 31:24.400
I'll call you.

31:33.000 --> 31:34.080
Isabel.

31:37.360 --> 31:39.080
What are you doing in the dark?

31:41.120 --> 31:42.960
It's such a beautiful day.

31:46.480 --> 31:49.000
Look what I've brought you.

31:50.800 --> 31:52.680
Croquettes!
I know you love them.

31:55.080 --> 31:56.080
Leave me alone.

31:56.440 --> 31:59.160
Isabel, stop this.
You have to eat.

31:59.320 --> 32:01.200
-Leave me.
-Come on, look.

32:01.400 --> 32:03.120
-At least try one.
-Just leave it.

32:03.320 --> 32:05.600
-Come on, honey, please.
-Leave me alone!

32:12.080 --> 32:13.080
Don't touch me.

32:16.560 --> 32:18.160
Please, don't touch me.

32:22.320 --> 32:23.280
Right, get ready.

32:23.440 --> 32:25.800
-No.
-Get ready, we're going.

32:26.640 --> 32:27.640
We're leaving.

32:30.360 --> 32:32.200
No. No. No!

32:49.160 --> 32:51.680
-Why are you here?
-Didn't you hear the bell?

32:51.880 --> 32:55.320
-You didn't answer my calls.
-Make yourself at home.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
I was in the shower,
as you can see.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.640
And you better have
a good reason to be here,

33:00.800 --> 33:03.200
-I've had a really crappy day.
-I do.

33:04.920 --> 33:06.480
You're getting water everywhere.

33:07.600 --> 33:08.600
Damn!

33:09.040 --> 33:11.000
Basauri is on
the Córdoba highway.

33:13.760 --> 33:16.720
You turn up at my place
at 10 o'clock at night

33:16.920 --> 33:19.280
to tell me a free man
is going to Córdoba?

33:19.960 --> 33:21.880
He should be headed north.
Something's up.

33:22.040 --> 33:24.040
He can go wherever he likes.
He's free.

33:24.040 --> 33:26.480
He was headed north
when he was found.

33:26.680 --> 33:29.600
He must have changed his mind,
decided to head south.

33:29.800 --> 33:33.040
Why? To celebrate his release
with a swift rebujito cocktail?

33:33.840 --> 33:37.040
-How do you know where he is?
-A buddy up in Control told me.

33:37.800 --> 33:38.800
Illegally.

33:39.920 --> 33:42.640
Right, a guy responsible
for 12 attacks

33:42.800 --> 33:45.120
threatens us,
tells us "this isn't over",

33:45.280 --> 33:47.920
and my biggest concern
is getting a warrant?

33:50.320 --> 33:52.200
No problem. I'll go alone.

33:53.120 --> 33:55.240
No, wait.
You're not going alone.

33:55.440 --> 33:56.680
I'll go with you.

34:28.160 --> 34:30.920
Forget your makeup,
we're in a rush.

36:21.040 --> 36:22.040
Hello, Father.

36:23.000 --> 36:24.440
I wasn't expecting you.

36:26.640 --> 36:29.000
You look good...
for being fresh out of jail.

36:31.680 --> 36:33.120
Sorry to disappoint you.

36:34.600 --> 36:37.680
You'd rather I looked sick?
Covered in blisters?

36:38.240 --> 36:39.240
Or bald, perhaps?

36:40.240 --> 36:41.240
Well, I'm not.

36:53.080 --> 36:54.800
I see you're not penny pinching.

36:55.960 --> 36:56.960
Should I be?

36:58.040 --> 36:59.760
Your mother chose that crockery.

37:02.120 --> 37:03.120
It's nice.

37:04.600 --> 37:07.160
-She had good taste.
-You killed her.

37:07.480 --> 37:09.080
After what you did
to those girls,

37:09.240 --> 37:10.880
your mother got sick.

37:11.160 --> 37:13.480
She died thinking
she'd failed as a mother.

37:13.760 --> 37:15.920
Yes, I saw her obituary
in the paper.

37:18.800 --> 37:22.400
Did you know... that prisoners
have full access to news?

37:24.080 --> 37:27.000
You're heartless.
We gave you everything.

37:27.160 --> 37:29.120
Love, protection. Everything!

37:40.160 --> 37:42.760
Let's leave the past behind
and talk about now.

37:42.920 --> 37:44.200
Are you here to kick me out?

37:45.680 --> 37:46.760
Fine.

37:47.480 --> 37:49.640
That's all you
care about, isn't it?

37:50.320 --> 37:51.480
Well...

37:51.680 --> 37:53.600
I know exactly
where I stand, Father.

37:54.280 --> 37:57.040
I might be a heartless criminal

37:57.480 --> 37:58.480
but I'm no fool.

37:59.640 --> 38:02.640
-You get nothing when I die.
-You think I don't know?

38:03.360 --> 38:06.840
Your mother left you the lot.
This house, shares...

38:07.520 --> 38:08.600
You're rich.

38:13.040 --> 38:14.040
She was a saint.

38:16.120 --> 38:17.480
God rest her soul.

38:20.840 --> 38:24.040
-I wish you were never born.
-Well, here I am.

38:27.120 --> 38:30.120
Shall I call a taxi...
or your driver?

39:33.720 --> 39:36.000
-It says he's here.
-In the middle of nowhere?

39:37.120 --> 39:38.600
I don't know, I can't see.

39:40.880 --> 39:41.880
There's a light.

40:05.280 --> 40:06.440
Take it easy!

40:06.800 --> 40:07.920
It's alright.

40:09.040 --> 40:10.000
Stay calm.

40:10.000 --> 40:10.040
Stay calm.
Nieto!

40:10.040 --> 40:11.000
Nieto!

40:12.080 --> 40:13.080
Nieto!

40:15.960 --> 40:16.960
Nieto.

40:21.400 --> 40:23.880
-Quick! Get him out!
-He's tied up!

40:24.080 --> 40:25.200
Nieto, he's tied up.

40:26.800 --> 40:29.440
-Get out. Get on the ground.
-Get down!

40:32.200 --> 40:33.200
Come on!

40:33.840 --> 40:36.000
Come on! Let him go!

40:37.240 --> 40:38.840
-Get over there!
-No!

40:38.960 --> 40:40.000
-Move!
-No!

41:05.520 --> 41:06.520
Isabel.

41:08.440 --> 41:09.480
Isabel.

41:17.120 --> 41:18.120
Are you alright?

41:23.880 --> 41:24.880
Yeah?

41:29.920 --> 41:32.360
For the love of God.

41:32.520 --> 41:34.200
Say what you like,
it changes nothing.

41:34.360 --> 41:36.120
Shut up, Nieto.

41:36.240 --> 41:38.920
Go to the hospital
and get a damn check-up.

41:39.080 --> 41:40.880
-I'm fine.
-Like hell you are.

41:41.000 --> 41:42.760
-You're a mess.
-It was my fault.

41:42.960 --> 41:44.040
He was protecting me.

41:44.240 --> 41:47.440
-She protected the terrorist.
-Isabel, don't move.

41:47.800 --> 41:49.040
What's going on here?

41:49.040 --> 41:49.120
What's going on here?
The monkey escaped
while you protected each other.

41:49.120 --> 41:52.240
The monkey escaped
while you protected each other.

41:52.440 --> 41:54.240
Neither of you thought
to go after him?

41:54.480 --> 41:57.080
This case is
about catching the killer.

41:57.280 --> 41:58.560
You should have gone.

41:58.760 --> 42:01.080
You should have left Basauri
where he was.

42:02.200 --> 42:03.400
Isn't she off the TV?

42:05.640 --> 42:07.960
-You're the commissioner, right?
-Yes.

42:08.400 --> 42:09.840
I want to file a report.

42:10.000 --> 42:13.280
I want the police out looking
for my attacker, now.

42:13.440 --> 42:16.200
-I'm sorry, but protocol...
-Screw protocol.

42:16.880 --> 42:18.000
It's a miracle I'm alive.

42:18.160 --> 42:21.000
I couldn't remember my name
for the last five hours.

42:21.000 --> 42:23.040
Please,
speak to the person out front...

42:23.200 --> 42:26.480
The person out front is a moron
who asks stupid questions.

42:27.400 --> 42:29.840
He asked if
I remember my attacker's face.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.800
If I'd have seen that bastard,

42:33.000 --> 42:35.320
I'd have gone after him myself,
you get me?

42:35.440 --> 42:38.160
I think the police
know how to do their job, Ana.

42:39.640 --> 42:40.840
What happened to you?

42:41.880 --> 42:43.160
Nothing the press
needs to know.

42:43.440 --> 42:44.800
I'll be the judge
of that.

42:45.360 --> 42:48.000
-Ana. Ana, was it?
-Yes, Ana Hurtado.

42:48.160 --> 42:50.480
Come with me to see
if we can speed things up.

42:50.640 --> 42:52.240
-This way.
-Thank you.

42:55.200 --> 42:57.080
-You know her?
-Of course.

42:57.960 --> 43:00.920
Everyone does,
she's a famous journalist.

43:01.080 --> 43:02.160
I didn't know who she was.

43:07.200 --> 43:10.040
I'm heading home.
Enough mistakes for one day.

43:10.200 --> 43:12.200
I'll go speak to our prisoner,

43:12.560 --> 43:14.160
let him know
he's no longer a suspect.

43:15.600 --> 43:17.600
A bit of good news in his life.

43:17.720 --> 43:20.160
Now, he can carry on
living the life of Riley.

43:27.280 --> 43:28.280
He refused dinner.

43:29.160 --> 43:29.920
What was it today?

43:30.080 --> 43:31.520
-Steak and chard.
-No!

43:31.720 --> 43:33.080
Open up, quick!

43:35.800 --> 43:37.600
Get him down!

43:38.320 --> 43:40.160
You damn bastard...

43:43.520 --> 43:44.880
Goddammit!

43:45.880 --> 43:46.920
Get the belt off.

43:49.400 --> 43:50.400
He has a pulse.

43:58.240 --> 43:59.640
Call a doctor, Isabel!

44:03.240 --> 44:04.640
Get an ambulance!

45:17.160 --> 45:18.160
Isabel?

45:51.080 --> 45:52.360
Isabel!

47:41.360 --> 47:43.120
I won't let you go, you hear me?

47:44.520 --> 47:45.760
I won't let you die.

47:46.320 --> 47:47.520
I won't let you die.

47:49.240 --> 47:50.440
I won't let you die.

48:06.760 --> 48:07.760
Are you okay?

48:07.920 --> 48:09.120
Alright, take it easy.

48:09.240 --> 48:12.200
-An ambulance is on its way.
-The ambulance is coming.

48:23.320 --> 48:24.480
Damn...

48:25.080 --> 48:26.080
What a day.

48:28.720 --> 48:30.160
You've been quite
the savior today.

48:32.280 --> 48:33.400
Suits me, right?

49:25.000 --> 49:26.920
Oh, Father...

49:29.080 --> 49:30.480
Haven't you had enough?
