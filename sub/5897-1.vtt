01:00.566 --> 01:03.588
Sir, you'd better open the door.

01:03.782 --> 01:07.717
What can I do for you?
- We got a complaint for disturbing the peace.

01:07.773 --> 01:10.969
It is not a disorder,
we just fight.

01:10.989 --> 01:13.629
Man and woman hassle.
- Ma'am, are you okay ??

01:13.649 --> 01:17.436
You do not have to talk to them.
- Sir, away from the door.

01:17.456 --> 01:20.915
I said we just fight.
- We want to ask her.

01:24.585 --> 01:26.831
You're under arrest.
- What the hell for?

01:26.851 --> 01:30.254
For assaulting a policeman.
- Let me go.

01:30.274 --> 01:33.084
<I> On your knees. </ I>
- <I> I have not done anything </ i>.

01:34.152 --> 01:36.237

<I> No, stop </ i>

01:58.266 --> 02:02.295
<I> Let me go. </ I>

02:03.556 --> 02:07.891

03:09.064 --> 03:11.219
You see them?
- What?

03:11.239 --> 03:13.518
They do it to their liking,
it is becoming more violent.

03:13.978 --> 03:17.894
It's a party, mate.
Relax.

03:19.849 --> 03:22.155
Yes, I'm glad I'm here.

03:22.736 --> 03:24.474
Yes I know that.

03:33.048 --> 03:35.074
Do you want some?

03:47.204 --> 03:48.922
Keep it.

04:00.298 --> 04:03.213
Keep your mouth shut and let me talk.

04:23.010 --> 04:25.516
<I> Who is this guy doing? </ I>
- <I> He is with me </ i>.

04:25.560 --> 04:27.927
That's not the deal.
- Do you want this or not?

04:28.373 --> 04:31.196
Loco, they are two? N.

04:58.539 --> 05:00.563
What you got for me, cowboy?

05:01.827 --> 05:03.566
Where's the money?

05:05.857 --> 05:07.584
Give that motherfucker his money.

05:44.059 --> 05:46.162
It better be good quality.

06:17.574 --> 06:21.652
Viktor, I go.
- Where are you going?

06:43.770 --> 06:45.630
What is this mess?

06:47.476 --> 06:49.494
Would you cheat me, asshole?

06:52.313 --> 06:54.167
Seattle PD.

06:58.323 --> 06:59.937
Get out.

07:18.185 --> 07:23.090
Lie on your knees.

07:24.699 --> 07:26.491
Mike, grab that weapon.

07:28.011 --> 07:29.771
Keep your mouth shut.

07:35.763 --> 07:37.629
No movement.

07:45.813 --> 07:47.350
Give me your hand.

07:55.217 --> 07:58.707
Stay here.
Stay here, damn it.

08:06.143 --> 08:08.238
Back, to the inside.
- What ...

08:09.131 --> 08:10.856
Stop, police.

08:18.074 --> 08:20.088
Greg, I'm that guy lost.
I want 20.

08:20.108 --> 08:22.355
I'm on the fourth floor. He
leave the building and is armed.

08:22.375 --> 08:24.428
I go through the stairwell.
- Roger, I'm coming your way.

08:24.448 --> 08:26.054
I cut him off stride.

08:49.790 --> 08:51.310
No movement.

09:49.505 --> 09:55.495
No, damn it.
Shit, not dying man.

09:55.575 --> 09:57.183
Jesus Christ, Mike.

09:57.203 --> 09:59.633
I came around the corner and
it seemed that he came to me.

09:59.653 --> 10:03.112
I ...
Call it in, call the ambulance.

10:03.132 --> 10:06.928
Do not die, damn it.
- He's already dead.

10:06.948 --> 10:09.597
Damn, cunt.

10:13.106 --> 10:16.082
Did anyone see you?
- No.

10:16.348 --> 10:18.692
No.
- Ok ?.

10:20.904 --> 10:23.313
Give me that even with that weapon from above.
- What?

10:23.333 --> 10:25.687
Give me the gun, Mike.

10:27.115 --> 10:28.779
Ok ?, damn.

10:29.357 --> 10:32.564
No man, no.
- Listen to me.

10:32.584 --> 10:34.237
Go to the side.

10:35.091 --> 10:37.939
You were chasing the suspect
on the stairwell, ok ??

10:37.959 --> 10:39.834
He fired twice.

10:43.398 --> 10:45.599
Well? You shot back.

10:47.383 --> 10:49.511
No, I do not.

10:49.531 --> 10:51.874
I do not, no.
- Yes, you are.

10:51.894 --> 10:54.062
No me ...
- Yes, you are.

10:54.082 --> 10:59.229
You participate, listen to me.
Listen damn to me.

10:59.300 --> 11:02.634
You do it, you fucking do it.

11:05.971 --> 11:09.017
It was an accident.
- Ok ?.

11:10.858 --> 11:14.137
You're a good cop, Mike.
And I will not let you pay for here.

11:14.858 --> 11:20.839
What is the alternative?
He is by and you go to jail

11:21.067 --> 11:22.945
and they could not retrieve him.

11:23.913 --> 11:25.480
Ok ??

11:26.250 --> 11:30.761
Think about your family.
Think of your child.

11:31.250 --> 11:32.760
Ok ??

11:32.780 --> 11:34.475
Look at me, I got you
ever abandoned?

11:34.495 --> 11:38.894
No, until now, no.
- Ok ?, then you should trust me now.

11:38.926 --> 11:44.520
You have to trust me now.
because I'm going to settle this, ok ??

11:51.018 --> 11:54.654
You did good, man.
I'll settle this.

11:56.727 --> 12:01.503
Ok ?, you have done well.

12:03.804 --> 12:05.648
I'll settle this.

12:19.441 --> 12:22.631
Lewis, come on please.
- Please.

12:27.499 --> 12:29.005
Johny,
- Captain.

12:29.025 --> 12:32.366
Make sure you keep away the press there,
it's a mess in there.

12:33.261 --> 12:35.865
Charlie, good to see you.
Miles.

12:37.712 --> 12:41.287
Gallo. Why did you
not asked for backup?

12:41.307 --> 12:45.686
We had no time, Captain.
My informant reached me shortly before

12:45.706 --> 12:50.211
but by the time Gallo and I
were here it was already loose.

12:50.231 --> 12:52.911
Is that right, Gallo?
- Yes, sir.

12:53.011 --> 12:54.693
David, come here.

12:55.803 --> 12:59.301
Yes.
- What happened in the stairwell?

12:59.533 --> 13:04.491
Captain?
- That boy, what happened?

13:04.625 --> 13:10.590
Listen, Gallo chased him and
The suspect walked into the hall

13:10.610 --> 13:15.159
and fired twice at him.
Mike, grabbed his gun and shot him.

13:15.464 --> 13:18.049
That boy has shot twice?
- Yes.

13:18.069 --> 13:21.529
And Gallo has ?? s time shot?
- Yes that's right.

13:22.569 --> 13:24.690
And that boy has shot first?
Captain ...

13:24.720 --> 13:28.703
Are you sure?
- That's what I've seen, sir.

13:29.329 --> 13:33.858
Gallo, I'm sorry it's hard.
How are you?

13:34.104 --> 13:36.589
It will be fine.
So the boy drew his weapon

13:36.609 --> 13:39.346
while you chased him.
- Yes, sir.

13:39.366 --> 13:41.668
And he shot twice?
- Yes.

13:41.688 --> 13:43.595
How many times have you shot?
- E once.

13:43.615 --> 13:45.455
Are you sure?
- Yes, sir.

13:45.475 --> 13:48.121
And boy shot first?
- Sure.

13:48.141 --> 13:52.188
Are you sure?
Well, we go back inside

13:52.208 --> 13:55.859
and go after all now it all
is still fresh, ok ??

13:55.879 --> 13:57.433
Lewis.

14:09.684 --> 14:11.461
I've been waiting for you.

14:12.247 --> 14:17.096
How is he?
- Good.

14:17.129 --> 14:19.403
Your "he" could be a "she."

14:23.626 --> 14:26.063
I shot a guy today.

14:28.079 --> 14:31.467
<I> Gallo, I know you're upset. </ I>

14:31.751 --> 14:35.265
<I> Ok ?, but you just did your job. </ I>

14:36.781 --> 14:42.183
He can not have been older than 15 years.
He stood in the hall

14:42.203 --> 14:44.638
and I thought he was someone else.

14:45.659 --> 14:51.203
<I> Half the people do not know
what we experience every day. </ i>

14:51.223 --> 14:53.912
Yes, a wild night for me.

14:55.790 --> 15:00.839
<I> That you had to be there
lying on the ground bleeding to death, ok ?? </ i>

15:04.262 --> 15:06.467
I saw him breathe his last breath.

15:07.873 --> 15:13.669
Listen to me.
I do not care the pieces

15:13.689 --> 15:18.797
what you think, or did not.
They'll nail you to the cross.

15:20.983 --> 15:22.718
I shot.

15:48.239 --> 15:52.127
He came to me recently and had
a girl and said, "I like her very much

15:52.147 --> 15:55.884
and wants her to the ball and I want
maybe buy her flowers. '

15:55.904 --> 16:00.109
And then I thought: 'How sweet. '
"With what money?"

16:00.875 --> 16:03.000
I told him to look for work.
- Yes?

16:03.020 --> 16:06.849
You have a phone call.
Maybe my trip to Hawaii?

16:07.933 --> 16:10.127
Hi, Karen.

16:22.808 --> 16:24.429
Where is he?

16:28.512 --> 16:30.541
I'm really sorry, Karen.

16:32.093 --> 16:34.201
You do not want to see him so.

16:51.565 --> 16:57.057
Ramon, honey.

17:46.554 --> 17:48.332
Let it go.

17:48.753 --> 17:50.994
That's not, honey.
- Leave it to go.

17:51.021 --> 17:54.957
No.
- It's the office.

17:54.977 --> 17:57.132
Call them back.

18:01.001 --> 18:05.936
So, when?

18:06.788 --> 18:11.089
Jesus.
Who's the agent in charge?

18:15.510 --> 18:19.080
No, I'm about an hour in the office.

18:19.976 --> 18:23.919
What was that about?
- Your husband.

18:26.047 --> 18:27.842
God.

18:45.394 --> 18:48.299
Captain.
- Good morning, Aaron.

18:48.319 --> 18:51.209
Good morning, thank you for coming.
- With pleasure.

18:53.454 --> 18:56.149
We have a problem case, Daniel

18:56.176 --> 19:00.043
A 15 year old boy slain in
a shoot-out with your agents.

19:00.063 --> 19:03.444
It was a justified act, Aaron.
- You call it justified?

19:03.455 --> 19:06.678
An official investigation is started.
- Of course, that's procedure.

19:06.698 --> 19:09.691
I'll talk to Mattis.
- Mattis, intoxicated with a bow around it.

19:09.711 --> 19:12.670
Why?
- Because I have someone else design.

19:12.857 --> 19:16.096
Jessica Dawson.
- I do not know her.

19:16.116 --> 19:17.983
She's new.

19:20.387 --> 19:23.281
She just comes from detective and Office East.

19:23.301 --> 19:27.127
Apparently there are not her
and arrested her partner

19:27.147 --> 19:30.399
because he is a handcuffed suspect
half-dead hit last year.

19:31.527 --> 19:36.649
Is that a problem?
- No, we have heard a lot of that case.

19:38.781 --> 19:44.190
Note Daniel, is there something wrong with this case.
We have just not found it yet.

19:44.210 --> 19:48.801
I'm not worried Aaron.
Mike Gallo has followed the procedures.

19:48.821 --> 19:52.081
And he's a good cop.
- They are all good policemen

19:52.634 --> 19:56.584
until they are no more.
- The guy pulled a gun and shot first.

19:56.604 --> 20:01.449
To all appearances.
- Aaron, there is a witness who confirmed.

20:01.469 --> 20:03.555
Detective Miles?
- Yes.

20:06.043 --> 20:08.563
Not credible.
- What do you mean?

20:08.583 --> 20:13.711
A long list of misdemeanors.
He is a projectile and in my opinion

20:13.731 --> 20:18.331
he does not belong to the police.
- Fortunately, I did not board my desk

20:18.351 --> 20:23.207
according to your opinions, Aaron.
He is one of my most effective people

20:23.227 --> 20:26.187
and he is a decorated officer.
- They shot a little kid down

20:26.207 --> 20:29.706
in the middle of an apartment complex, Daniel.
- They shot an intruder down

20:29.726 --> 20:32.035
who shot at the police.

20:34.035 --> 20:35.714
Maybe you are right.

20:36.955 --> 20:41.319
But that does not change the fact that an
white cop killed a black boy

20:41.339 --> 20:43.377
without the slightest warning.

20:43.397 --> 20:47.169
The press will have a beautiful day with this,
I must remind you that?

20:47.231 --> 20:51.085
I sit on a winnable place here.
it is clear to me.

20:53.033 --> 20:56.995
When all hell breaks loose and I
promise you that it will happen

20:57.877 --> 21:01.317
I'm not the one going to fool.

21:02.476 --> 21:06.467
Count your once good at this. I would
find annoying when you are sucked.

21:06.487 --> 21:11.583
With respect, in connection
your upcoming retirement.

21:12.060 --> 21:15.649
How long do you have, six months?
- Yes.

21:16.369 --> 21:20.091
What do you say, Aaron?
- I'll tell you how things stand.

21:20.579 --> 21:24.295
Ok ?, there is anything else?

21:25.173 --> 21:26.987
That's all for now.

21:27.170 --> 21:28.680
Ok ?.

21:29.139 --> 21:30.943
Thank you, Captain.
- Thank you.

21:32.863 --> 21:35.037
Let the Morel files
bring inside, please.

21:36.337 --> 21:37.859
Bianca.

22:02.041 --> 22:03.939
Ms. Rivera?

22:05.533 --> 22:08.570
I'm Agent Jones.
- May I now take my son?

22:08.590 --> 22:11.357
Madam, Ramon was found
with a gun in his possession

22:11.377 --> 22:15.313
when he died.
Therefore fired the agent.

22:16.185 --> 22:19.746
What? What are you talking about,
that is not possible.

22:19.766 --> 22:23.121
Ma'am, I understand
that this is not easy.

22:23.141 --> 22:26.074
But I can assure you that very
capable people working on this.

22:26.094 --> 22:29.028
Very capable?
As the one who fired at ...

22:30.719 --> 22:33.120
I want my son.

22:36.795 --> 22:42.199
A good student, no notes,
no contacts with gangs

22:42.219 --> 22:48.210
No suspension from school and shoot from
close to an agent in the middle of the night.

22:51.871 --> 22:53.974
Do you think that's strange, detective?

22:55.747 --> 22:59.246
I do not have enough facts to an opinion
about having this matter, sir.

22:59.840 --> 23:04.649
Why do I ask a novice detective
without any experience in internal affairs of

23:04.669 --> 23:06.807
to conduct this research?

23:08.201 --> 23:10.435
Sir, I can not answer.

23:11.066 --> 23:14.966
You testified against your partner, right?
- Yes, sir.

23:15.608 --> 23:18.814
He was found not guilty
if I remember correctly.

23:18.844 --> 23:23.284
You were however transferred
with administrative tasks.

23:25.674 --> 23:29.590
You are a muggenzifter,
a danger to anyone.

23:29.610 --> 23:32.248
There is no executive who you
ever give a promotion.

23:34.877 --> 23:36.898
Why they chose you?

23:38.205 --> 23:42.625
Because internal affairs is everything
you have left.

23:52.925 --> 23:55.027
So they just shot him down?
- Yes.

23:55.047 --> 23:57.350
Why?
- I do not know why.

23:57.370 --> 24:00.272
That boy was just standing there
and the cop shot him just down.

24:00.292 --> 24:02.520
How often do I have to have to explain?

24:02.544 --> 24:05.541
Does he know you've seen him?
- I do not know.

24:05.725 --> 24:08.580
Perhaps, yes.
- Then they'll find you.

24:08.600 --> 24:12.746
Do you think I know that?
- My God, Jacob

24:12.766 --> 24:17.131
We have to leave here.
- And where can we go?

24:17.151 --> 24:19.771
I do not know. I have a cousin in Virginia,
maybe we can go to her,

24:19.791 --> 24:23.740
Virginia?
What are we doing in Virginia?

24:23.964 --> 24:27.303
Minimum wage, work,
The ends meet.

24:27.521 --> 24:32.474
No, we do not.
- Look how we live now.

24:33.051 --> 24:36.742
You said that the last transaction
would be, and then no more.

24:36.762 --> 24:39.817
You promised.
- It does not all go as planned, right?

24:39.827 --> 24:43.637
Let's forget it and just leave.
- We have no money, Angela.

24:43.657 --> 24:47.629
No food, no money for the rent, nothing.
- Find a job.

24:47.649 --> 24:51.446
Stop whining.
Jesus, I rule it.

24:51.466 --> 24:55.600
Mom?
- It's all right, darling,

24:55.620 --> 24:58.051
Mommy and Daddy are just talking, ok ??

24:58.917 --> 25:04.108
Hey, big guy.
Did we scare you?

25:05.656 --> 25:09.714
Sorry.
Listen, I'll take this, okay ??

25:09.725 --> 25:11.434
So let me handle it.

25:13.156 --> 25:15.770
<I> What we do is not bad, ok ?? </ i>

25:16.827 --> 25:19.016
<I> I'll take you back to bed, okay ?? </ i>

26:04.081 --> 26:07.249
How are you?
- Pressure.

26:07.611 --> 26:09.784
<I> Yeah, I know.
You're always busy. </ I>

26:09.878 --> 26:11.760
What do you want, David?

26:12.240 --> 26:17.471
Listen, I was hoping
I could see you tomorrow even.

26:17.548 --> 26:19.438
I do not think so.

26:19.919 --> 26:23.898
The only thing I ask is
if you want to have lunch with me.

26:24.407 --> 26:27.095
Yet you still know
we're divorced, right?

26:28.006 --> 26:31.268
Yes, I do know, but I ...

26:32.553 --> 26:34.660
I just missed you.

26:37.809 --> 26:39.606
Please, do not.

26:53.826 --> 26:57.921
I had a very difficult
arrest this morning.

27:04.560 --> 27:09.054
A boy was slain.
- Yes, I heard.

27:15.948 --> 27:20.137
Look where I am.
I feel a bit alone here

27:20.157 --> 27:22.092
and you're the only friend I have.

27:25.360 --> 27:27.455
Have you signed the papers?

27:32.648 --> 27:34.607
David?

27:36.554 --> 27:38.479
What are they ...
Yes.

27:39.863 --> 27:44.832
David.
- I'll take them.

27:45.165 --> 27:50.250
Well, eating lunch.
Goodbye, David.

27:50.937 --> 27:52.910
Listen, I ...

28:16.757 --> 28:18.911
Bam, asshole.

28:27.444 --> 28:31.517
Jacob, where have you been all this time?

28:32.168 --> 28:36.331
I stayed out of sight.
It was disturbed when.

28:36.351 --> 28:39.516
I can not believe you
are there out alive.

28:39.848 --> 28:43.431
Just on.
Those cops were shooting inside.

28:47.302 --> 28:51.996
Do you know what happened to that guy?
- What guy?

28:52.595 --> 28:57.052
Emerging from the news, they have slain.

28:57.163 --> 28:59.506
Yeah, I heard that he was on the police
has shot.

28:59.932 --> 29:03.730
Disturbed Mexican.
- That damn Mexicans.

29:03.908 --> 29:09.270
No, that boy has done nothing.

29:09.844 --> 29:12.365
That cop shot him in cold blood.

29:17.144 --> 29:20.209
Did you see that?
- It was really weird.

29:20.834 --> 29:26.151
Listen man, I think we are
momentarily not have to see.

29:26.880 --> 29:31.954
I can not use that kind of attention
so come here but no more.

29:35.738 --> 29:37.362
Yes that is good.

29:38.235 --> 29:41.099
Maybe I'm out of town.
I am fed up.

29:41.455 --> 29:45.491
Once I get my money I'm out.
- What?

29:45.877 --> 29:48.272
Your money?
- Yes man.

29:48.386 --> 29:52.830
My part.
- There is no part.

29:52.850 --> 29:57.820
That deal backfired.
- I know you took all that money.

29:57.895 --> 30:00.140
So just give me my share
and then I'm gone.

30:00.160 --> 30:04.599
What're you talking about?
What are you talking about, man?

30:05.412 --> 30:08.342
You're lucky to be alive.

30:12.335 --> 30:15.576
And how do I know it was not the informant
who betrayed us to the police?

30:15.596 --> 30:17.766
Get the col? Re with your bullshit.
- I col get re?

30:17.786 --> 30:23.582
Yes, I am not a traitor.
- The money Samuel, I have earned it.

30:28.184 --> 30:30.593
Turn it over.

30:32.434 --> 30:34.900
You store not as a tone with me.

30:35.786 --> 30:37.563
Give me your fucking arm.

30:39.423 --> 30:41.504
You know what we do to traitors?

31:51.868 --> 31:55.292
Detective Dawson? Captain Richards wants you
like speaking in his office.

32:03.954 --> 32:05.470

32:11.052 --> 32:14.874

32:17.618 --> 32:22.111
Yes, please sit down.

32:22.646 --> 32:24.234
Thank you.

32:27.319 --> 32:32.527
I understand that you are new.
- I'm new to this office, yes.

32:32.852 --> 32:36.078
And new to internal affairs.
- Yes.

32:36.566 --> 32:39.430
Would you like some coffee?
- No, thank you, sir.

32:41.692 --> 32:47.008
I do not know what you expect

32:47.028 --> 32:51.604
But I want you to know that at this office
Internal affairs is not a separate department.

32:51.951 --> 32:55.964
It is not us against.
- I understand that.

32:55.984 --> 32:59.048
I know you have to do your job,
I must also.

32:59.190 --> 33:02.733
I want as little a rampage
officer in my department than you.

33:02.753 --> 33:06.042
I just want you to remember that we are here
all professional police men

33:06.062 --> 33:09.571
and women too, of course.

33:10.013 --> 33:14.228
We do our best to the community
protect and serve.

33:14.248 --> 33:16.422
We are not the bad guys, ok ??

33:16.553 --> 33:18.542
Of course.
- Ok ?.

33:20.912 --> 33:23.587
So you've got the Gallo case?
- Yes.

33:23.607 --> 33:26.496
How's it going so far?
- I did not have all the facts, sir.

33:26.516 --> 33:29.944
You've surely got the reports?
- I've got them.

33:31.403 --> 33:35.988
Do agent Gallo, administrative service now?
- Yes, until further notice.

33:36.223 --> 33:39.743
So you do not suspend him?
- No.

33:39.770 --> 33:42.363
That depends on your research.

33:42.661 --> 33:44.486
I want to question him.
- Of course.

33:44.506 --> 33:49.862
And the other officer, Detective Miles.
- Yeah, are available.

33:49.882 --> 33:53.547
Thank you.
- And I also hope to be able to contribute.

33:53.580 --> 33:55.183
Thank you, sir.

33:58.305 --> 34:00.362
Do you have any questions?

34:01.157 --> 34:03.125
They will still come.

34:03.710 --> 34:07.242
That's all over.
- Thank you, sir.

34:12.935 --> 34:14.507
Ms. Dawson?

34:15.687 --> 34:20.188
Unofficially. Hope you
do not mind me saying

34:20.208 --> 34:24.339
I did not expect such a young person.

34:29.329 --> 34:31.152
Thank you for coming.

35:21.291 --> 35:25.209
is that for me?
- It's probably cold.

35:25.535 --> 35:28.787
I know I am what I leave.
I ...

35:29.643 --> 35:33.215
I had a bad morning.
- You have chosen the time, David.

35:33.656 --> 35:38.586
And you instead.
- This was close to both of us.

35:38.606 --> 35:44.595
Only close to you, Rebecca.
Have you any idea where I stay?

35:46.546 --> 35:49.733
You get the house back soon.
I almost moved my stuff.

35:49.753 --> 35:54.471
I told you I do not want the house.
You can stay as long as you want.

35:54.491 --> 35:58.714
I am OK ?.
I move in with a friend.

35:58.915 --> 36:00.696
A friend?

36:02.128 --> 36:06.669
I get it, yes.

36:10.697 --> 36:13.604
You're such an asshole. I do not know
why I still energy in stop.

36:15.277 --> 36:17.830
I'm happy for you, Rebecca.

36:17.953 --> 36:20.250
No, I really, I ...

36:20.270 --> 36:25.059
The single life also goes well with me.
I have all kinds of options.

36:25.079 --> 36:29.654
If you are married also stopped.
- You left me.

36:31.174 --> 36:36.632
I'm not talking to you.
Did you bring the papers?

36:37.726 --> 36:42.194
Damn, the papers.
I forget them, I ...

36:46.769 --> 36:49.243
Why make this harder?

36:50.076 --> 36:52.277
Because I still love you.

36:56.910 --> 36:58.775
Rebecca, look at me.

36:59.356 --> 37:02.874
And tell me that you
Do not think of me.

37:05.115 --> 37:09.190
I have a meeting, I should go.
- Jesus Christ, we just got here.

37:09.210 --> 37:15.200
No, you're right.
I'm a half hour there, remember?

37:16.043 --> 37:20.560
Sign the papers and bring them along home.
- Rebecca, listen.

37:40.691 --> 37:42.230
Hey guys.

37:44.067 --> 37:49.961
Where are you going?
- I wanted to bring some stuff back home.

37:49.981 --> 37:52.246
Why do you not come back?

37:52.266 --> 37:56.236
This is only a temporary situation, it is
just as long as the investigation lasts.

37:58.600 --> 38:01.228
It will be fine.
- Why would not they be?

38:01.850 --> 38:04.048
Gives you nothing in your head, man.

38:04.788 --> 38:07.990
We do hard work and
sometimes things like this happen.

38:08.299 --> 38:11.488
Yes, you are right.
- Detective Dawson is an honest cop.

38:11.508 --> 38:14.524
Just tell your side of the story.
That's all you need to do.

38:14.585 --> 38:16.458
Ok ??
- Yes, sir.

38:16.478 --> 38:19.515
Leave your things here,
they are safe, come on.

38:23.595 --> 38:26.189
Look at that.

38:26.477 --> 38:29.915
That's a boy, you hear that?

38:30.293 --> 38:35.296
That's your baby's heartbeat.
A healthy boy, congratulations.

38:59.684 --> 39:03.939
<I> Do you remember that night? </ I>
- <I> Yes </ i>.

39:04.313 --> 39:07.472
<I> I want you to remember that this
is part of a criminal investigation. </ i>

39:07.492 --> 39:10.746
Do you understand.
- I understand that.

39:10.766 --> 39:14.714
I want to ensure that you do not get a
lawyer requested, is that correct?

39:16.417 --> 39:20.587
Do I need one?
- Answer the question detective.

39:22.842 --> 39:26.431
Yes ma'am, that's right.

39:27.138 --> 39:31.002
Detective, not answering my
questions or antagonizing any aspect

39:31.022 --> 39:34.795
This investigation or interrogation,
lead to criminal prosecution.

39:37.709 --> 39:39.309
Are you new?

39:41.093 --> 39:44.039
Everyone asks me that, does it matter?

39:47.364 --> 39:53.350
Do you mind that I smoke?
- Yes, it is a non-smoking building.

39:57.761 --> 40:00.067
And get your gun off the table, please.

40:05.484 --> 40:07.711
I have some questions for you.

40:09.773 --> 40:13.366
Who autoriseerde this operation?
- I did.

40:13.386 --> 40:16.542
Do you permission first
someone had from the office?

40:16.562 --> 40:21.206
No time. I got a tip and I have there
action taken.

40:22.239 --> 40:24.768
There is recovered any money, right?

40:29.123 --> 40:33.696
That was in my report, yes.
- I have read it.

40:34.663 --> 40:36.899
What time did you get
at the place of the event?

40:36.919 --> 40:42.468
Just after nightfall, the transaction
would occur around 20:00.

40:42.584 --> 40:46.753
And your mission?
- We are waiting just outside the building

40:47.024 --> 40:49.347
and Miles had the information.

40:49.733 --> 40:52.136
How long were you with the investigation
this operation involved?

40:52.156 --> 40:57.682
This group popped up a year ago
and we followed them for three months.

40:59.587 --> 41:03.969
Who gave you the details of the deal?
- I've never had that information.

41:03.989 --> 41:06.011
You know how many suspects
were involved?

41:06.031 --> 41:08.265
I've heard nothing about.

41:08.427 --> 41:11.575
You knew one of the suspects
Before playing this matter?

41:11.852 --> 41:14.519
No.
- But you identified Ramon Rivera

41:14.539 --> 41:18.068
as one of the drug dealers.
- You ever worked himself into the field, detective?

41:18.088 --> 41:20.014
Yes I have.
- Is there ever shot you?

41:20.034 --> 41:23.140
That someone wanted to kill you?
- That's irrelevant.

41:23.160 --> 41:27.728
You know nothing of it, why your question
perhaps those stupid questions.

41:29.298 --> 41:33.076
Tell me about Ramon Rivera.
- I know nothing about him.

41:33.097 --> 41:36.418
What happened is terrible.
but happened so many around me

41:36.438 --> 41:40.771
and there was so much shot at me ...
- You made a mistake?

41:40.791 --> 41:45.236
No, I defended myself.

41:45.658 --> 41:47.410
He shot at you first?
- Yes.

41:47.430 --> 41:50.861
Yes.
- Yes, he shot first.

41:50.881 --> 41:55.177
E? N times, twice?
- I saw two shots, I heard two.

41:55.580 --> 41:58.494
I've fucking heard two shots.
- Heard or seen?

41:58.514 --> 42:02.810
He shot me, ?? n times, twice.
He had a gun and shot me.

42:02.830 --> 42:04.550
And you shot back?
- Yes.

42:04.570 --> 42:07.532
So you're saying that those 15 years old
boy without criminal

42:07.552 --> 42:09.870
was involved in this
giant drug deal?

42:13.974 --> 42:19.960
Cincinatti Ohio, writes a 15-year-old boy
a book report on Huckleberry Finn.

42:21.096 --> 42:23.628
The teacher gives him a six min.

42:24.264 --> 42:28.989
The next day he comes to school with the
weapon from his father and kills his teacher

42:29.009 --> 42:31.126
and eighteen others.

42:31.311 --> 42:35.919
Then stop that little bastard in the arm
his mouth and pulls the trigger.

42:36.435 --> 42:39.038
There is daily violence, detective.

42:39.465 --> 42:44.368
So tell me no nonsense story
a great kid

42:44.388 --> 42:49.836
which not hurt a fly.
Because I do not care of it.

42:55.007 --> 42:58.651
You were involved in yet so
a shooting, right?

42:59.622 --> 43:02.278
I am involved in a lot of shootings,
Yes.

43:02.971 --> 43:06.674
An unarmed car driver?
You cut him?

43:06.864 --> 43:08.621
I am acquitted.

43:09.522 --> 43:13.221
Not exactly. The case was settled with
the family of the boy

43:13.241 --> 43:15.809
and you got disciplinary leave.

43:21.089 --> 43:24.614
Did you bother to temper yourself
To maintain control, detective?

43:26.620 --> 43:28.570
What do you think?

43:28.871 --> 43:32.861
Is that why your wife
has had to impose a restraining order?

43:34.662 --> 43:39.405
And you're not even in a second
parting with your second wife?

43:42.790 --> 43:44.898
I do not think it's relevant.

43:45.692 --> 43:47.498
Not?

43:51.353 --> 43:53.276
That's all for today.

43:56.436 --> 43:58.673
This is for when you might
something forgotten.

44:00.912 --> 44:03.160
I forget nothing.

44:32.274 --> 44:37.119
An awkward, right?
- I've seen worse.

44:37.323 --> 44:43.110
All that nonsense about my personal history.
Cheap bullshit.

44:44.315 --> 44:46.883
Has she said anything that was not true?

44:49.474 --> 44:50.990
Do you do that?

44:55.864 --> 44:59.427
Do you want to ask me something, Captain?
- I asked you one direct question, David.

45:00.345 --> 45:03.379
Have not you said something inside
that is not true?

45:07.288 --> 45:10.014
Do not tell me you believe that nonsense.
- What I believe is

45:10.034 --> 45:13.545
that there is a very clear line to us
apart from the bad guys.

45:13.565 --> 45:16.700
They call it honor. Your father believed
there too, until the end.

45:16.720 --> 45:19.715
I have taken his place when you
graduated from the academy.

45:19.735 --> 45:23.104
And I supported you, even if no
otherwise this office did.

45:23.124 --> 45:27.309
So I ask you now, man
to man, your honor.

45:27.345 --> 45:30.349
Plays more in this case
then you tell me?

45:37.767 --> 45:42.555
I can not even believe
you ask me.

46:14.358 --> 46:16.781
You should go to the police, Jacob.

46:17.313 --> 46:21.475
They should listen to you.
- I can not do.

46:26.002 --> 46:28.314
I have just this sort.

46:30.464 --> 46:31.974
No.

46:33.460 --> 46:36.996
No, I can not do this anymore.

46:44.838 --> 46:47.572
I just need ...

46:49.394 --> 46:51.474
I just need a few days.

46:52.126 --> 46:57.943
Yes, you said a few days ago.
There is nothing better.

47:00.203 --> 47:02.869
We do not have enough food in the fridge.

47:10.733 --> 47:13.112
I can arrange this.

47:16.578 --> 47:19.679
Trust me.
- You trust?

47:25.830 --> 47:28.746
What happens the day
that you do not come home?

47:30.421 --> 47:32.961
What should I tell Adam?

47:36.059 --> 47:38.300
I'm going away, Jacob.

47:40.908 --> 47:46.105
With or without you. I let my son
not grow up in this mess.

47:46.125 --> 47:47.923
Angela ...

47:53.475 --> 47:55.437
Angela.

48:53.379 --> 48:57.777
No that is not necessary.
- Stay away from me.

48:58.546 --> 49:01.097
Or what?
Are you going to shoot me?

49:01.708 --> 49:04.655
I'm not armed.
- What do you want?

49:08.792 --> 49:11.249
Think you're better than me?

49:12.344 --> 49:15.314
Interrogate me like I'm the bad guy?

49:16.581 --> 49:21.520
You ask me about my temperament.
Let me tell you what makes me angry.

49:22.496 --> 49:28.485
Bureaucrats like you have no idea
what is needed to survive on the streets.

49:30.357 --> 49:34.354
Why do you think the hell
you're safe at night?

49:36.247 --> 49:40.900
And we need that bullshit
agents as you swallow.

49:41.367 --> 49:45.766
Once you get into the real world
then break you.

49:47.960 --> 49:51.486
What kind of cop now throws
his partner off the bus?

49:51.776 --> 49:56.728
A man with a wife and a child. And
Do you take him on because he does his job.

49:57.312 --> 50:00.511
You must be very lonely
so if you're a bitch, is not it?

50:04.790 --> 50:09.058
Maybe that's it.
Maybe you're lonely.

50:09.968 --> 50:12.222
Maybe I can help you with that.

50:12.435 --> 50:14.396
Backward.

50:15.757 --> 50:18.014
Backward, detective.

50:22.367 --> 50:24.206
You got me.

50:27.443 --> 50:29.287
Have a nice evening.

50:48.596 --> 50:52.363
<I> What kind of cop now throws
his partner out of the bus? </ i>

50:55.784 --> 50:59.025
<I> A man with a wife a child ... </ i>

51:05.538 --> 51:08.721
<I> Rodriguez, he's under control.
Stop, Trevor. </ I>

51:08.741 --> 51:11.138
<I> Fuck Dawson, watch your suspect. </ I>

51:20.931 --> 51:24.901
<I> Agent Rodriguez, put the gun down. </ I>

51:31.877 --> 51:33.850
<I> I'm your partner. </ I>

51:35.776 --> 51:37.854
<I> Drop it, now. </ I>

53:27.202 --> 53:28.710
<I> Thank you. </ I>

53:44.111 --> 53:45.654
What is going on?

53:45.674 --> 53:48.350
This is Detective Dawson. She wants
talk to you about this case.

53:48.370 --> 53:51.726
I do not think so.
What are you doing here?

53:52.885 --> 53:56.802
I questioned the tenants of the building.
Ramon came there often

53:56.822 --> 53:59.803
to visit his friend Viktor.
That night also.

53:59.993 --> 54:04.192
I talked to Victor and Ramon
never had a weapon with him.

54:04.212 --> 54:06.203
I have nothing to say.
- Michael.

54:06.772 --> 54:10.589
Penny, stay out here.
I want you to leave.

54:10.609 --> 54:14.985
You protect your partner?
- I've already given my statement.

54:15.005 --> 54:16.985
I've looked at your file. Michael.
You're not like Miles.

54:19.239 --> 54:21.821
If it was an accident, I can help you.

54:23.583 --> 54:26.280
Ramon did not shoot you
that day, is not it?

54:27.225 --> 54:29.244
He did not even have a weapon.

54:30.197 --> 54:33.180
The truth eventually comes up anyway.

54:38.260 --> 54:39.770
Goodbye, detective.

54:39.790 --> 54:42.037
<I> A life lost in this community </ i>

54:42.057 --> 54:43.857
life is too much.

54:43.877 --> 54:47.273
<I> That's why I will be the full force
my desk ... </ i>

54:47.938 --> 54:50.550
<I> And I promise you will look differently ... </ i>

54:52.562 --> 54:54.877
<I> Because life does matter ... </ i>

54:54.897 --> 54:58.586
<I> The life of Ramon matter. </ I>

55:21.009 --> 55:25.429
<I> Ms. Rivera, sorry
very much for your loss. </ i>

55:25.732 --> 55:29.463
I can not even imagine
how difficult this must be for you.

55:29.965 --> 55:33.243
But agent Mike Gallo, has
a clean record.

55:33.617 --> 55:36.713
No previous shootings.
- He's lying.

55:37.316 --> 55:39.142
And he had someone who could vouch for him.

55:39.162 --> 55:40.915
They lie both.

55:40.935 --> 55:43.772
Ms. Rivera.
- You all lie.

55:45.133 --> 55:49.870
Ms. Rivera, you know that your son
drugs?

55:51.028 --> 55:55.592
The autopsy report shows traces of
marijuana in his blood when he died.

55:57.130 --> 55:59.188
Have you never had warning signs?

56:02.168 --> 56:06.690
Mrs. Rivera wants to think that their children
involved in something like this.

56:06.710 --> 56:11.616
But with this evidence, there is nothing
we can do.

56:14.384 --> 56:16.020
Marijuana?

56:16.832 --> 56:22.058
You do not shoot someone down
because he used marijuana.

56:35.784 --> 56:40.148
Shall we make a party of it, dear?
Come here.

56:41.700 --> 56:43.414
Come here.

56:45.313 --> 56:47.514
Wanted you so badly, does not this?

56:48.000 --> 56:53.787
But calm, quiet.
Take it.

59:06.507 --> 59:08.689
Keep your damn head.

59:20.397 --> 59:22.231
Asshole.

59:25.914 --> 59:27.836
Sorry.
- Damn.

59:28.977 --> 59:31.386
Shut the fuck shut your head there.

59:36.952 --> 59:40.823
Get out you, damn it out.

59:44.037 --> 59:48.219
Sammy.
Did you hide me?

59:48.383 --> 59:50.638
Did you not think I'd find?

59:50.707 --> 59:53.369
No, I do not hide myself for you.

59:53.403 --> 59:56.211
I had to just get
quietly keep in a safe place.

59:56.664 --> 01:00:01.506
And this is a safe place?
- Yeah, no one gives me something here.

01:00:02.917 --> 01:00:04.716
Except you.

01:00:04.973 --> 01:00:06.920
Where is my money, damn it?

01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:13.957
Under the bed.
- Yes.

01:00:13.961 --> 01:00:15.580
Of course.

01:00:20.231 --> 01:00:24.167
You had it pretty fucked up.
We could have been dead.

01:00:25.098 --> 01:00:29.541
I told you to come alone.
Yes fixed, you and your

01:00:29.561 --> 01:00:32.502
damn trigger certain friends?

01:00:35.562 --> 01:00:40.559
Did you say that too at your partner?
he killed a boy.

01:00:44.046 --> 01:00:49.161
Why? You think I did not know
you think it stopped?

01:00:53.227 --> 01:00:55.806
You better pay attention, man.

01:00:56.669 --> 01:01:00.472
Do you walk to threaten me?
- I'm just, I'm just saying.

01:01:00.492 --> 01:01:02.766
What did you say?
- I did not say anything.

01:01:02.786 --> 01:01:05.161
Who did you tell.
- I have not told anyone.

01:01:05.181 --> 01:01:08.994
What the hell do you know?
- I know nothing, it is Jacob.

01:01:09.209 --> 01:01:12.978
He tells everyone in town that you
an unarmed boy gunned down.

01:01:12.998 --> 01:01:15.065
Well? I have nothing ...
- Have not you seen him?

01:01:15.954 --> 01:01:18.533
When you said that, I have
nothing said about it.

01:01:19.650 --> 01:01:23.470
Who the hell is Jacob?
- It's nothing, man.

01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:27.504
I gave him only brought because
you said you were going to arrest anyone, ok ??

01:01:27.524 --> 01:01:31.465
And it's not my fault
you guys they have run.

01:01:32.888 --> 01:01:34.693
Listen to me.
Look at me.

01:01:34.713 --> 01:01:37.104
Ok ?, come on, okay?

01:01:38.983 --> 01:01:41.037
Why would I say something.

01:01:41.964 --> 01:01:45.807
With everything that I already know about you?
- You fucking ...

01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:51.357
Damn.

01:01:53.301 --> 01:01:57.611
Get the col? Re, man.
What was that, damn it?

01:02:10.849 --> 01:02:13.419
Who is this guy?
- I do not know.

01:02:13.474 --> 01:02:16.316
Where is he?
- I saw him recently beaten up.

01:02:16.694 --> 01:02:18.886
Ok ?? No one has seen him since then.

01:02:22.422 --> 01:02:23.952
Damn.

01:02:35.288 --> 01:02:37.344
Ok ?, this is what we do.

01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:44.310
You think that guy and makes
he keeps his mouth.

01:02:46.650 --> 01:02:51.570
We have not agreed.
- Find him, then you get the rest.

01:02:52.419 --> 01:02:56.546
Look, this is bullshit. I'm not going ...
- Find him.

01:03:40.990 --> 01:03:42.550
What are we going to do now?

01:03:45.426 --> 01:03:47.789
The only thing we can do, Mike.

01:03:49.773 --> 01:03:53.221
If he has no one told
he also does not do, okay ??

01:03:54.602 --> 01:03:57.844
He will probably disappear.
- Are you kidding me?

01:03:57.864 --> 01:04:01.691
He talks all.
How do you think I found out?

01:04:02.259 --> 01:04:05.725
Do you want to take that risk, Mike?
Because I certainly do not want.

01:04:06.902 --> 01:04:11.444
We need to find that guy and care
that he no further talks.

01:04:19.995 --> 01:04:21.874
Are you okay?

01:04:26.605 --> 01:04:28.726
Richards, has suspended me.

01:04:30.779 --> 01:04:32.461
Yes, I heard.

01:04:36.705 --> 01:04:38.834
How deep is the investigation?

01:04:40.707 --> 01:04:42.963
As deep as needed, Mike.

01:06:14.652 --> 01:06:17.827
Mom?

01:06:19.385 --> 01:06:21.628
I made you breakfast.

01:06:54.544 --> 01:06:57.762
I need three people for dry walls.
- Yes, here.

01:06:57.783 --> 01:07:00.787
Wait.
Does someone here speak English?

01:07:01.370 --> 01:07:02.890
You, you and you.

01:07:10.382 --> 01:07:12.531
Gringo, you go with?
It does work though.

01:07:19.570 --> 01:07:21.891
Will you come back to school?

01:07:22.337 --> 01:07:25.933
I do not know.
I did not feel so good.

01:07:26.521 --> 01:07:28.882
My grandmother is deceased last year.

01:07:30.143 --> 01:07:34.389
My mother said that perhaps ...

01:07:36.567 --> 01:07:38.819
I can see my grandmother again maybe.

01:07:41.634 --> 01:07:44.047
Do you think it's true?
- Yes.

01:07:44.768 --> 01:07:46.880
And I think you're brother
also will see again.

01:07:51.744 --> 01:07:57.120
I hope you come back to school.
- That I do.

01:08:01.855 --> 01:08:03.860
Day.
- Day.

01:08:27.738 --> 01:08:30.800
Hello.
- Hi.

01:08:31.013 --> 01:08:32.828
You must be Amanda.

01:08:35.207 --> 01:08:37.737
I'm Jessica Dawson.
I'm from the police.

01:08:37.756 --> 01:08:39.279
Is your mother home?

01:08:41.299 --> 01:08:43.013
She is inside.

01:08:43.350 --> 01:08:45.768
Can you tell her I want to talk to her?

01:08:46.707 --> 01:08:50.663
She wants to talk to anyone,
She sleeps all the time.

01:08:54.363 --> 01:08:56.756
Are the police whosoever
my brother shot?

01:08:57.721 --> 01:09:00.165
I want to talk to your mother about.

01:09:02.804 --> 01:09:05.301
My brother has never done anyone any harm.

01:09:19.441 --> 01:09:22.611
Is yours?
Yes.

01:09:22.984 --> 01:09:26.615
My brother taught me to drive.
- Did he really?

01:09:27.932 --> 01:09:29.807
He was good on the bike.

01:09:30.969 --> 01:09:34.700
Tried every day after school
He teach me some tricks.

01:09:34.988 --> 01:09:37.340
<I> Ok?. </ I>
- <I> And I know there are also a few </ i>.

01:09:37.495 --> 01:09:39.310
<I> I was getting better. </ I>

01:09:40.076 --> 01:09:42.622
<I> I'm sure he would be very proud. </ I>

01:09:46.490 --> 01:09:48.126
Can I do something for you?

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:52.142
Hello Mrs. Rivera, I'm Jessica Dawson.
I am of internal affairs.

01:09:52.162 --> 01:09:54.440
Do you mind if I ...
- Amanda, go inside.

01:09:56.202 --> 01:09:57.720
Now.

01:10:01.379 --> 01:10:05.660
I want none of you around
My daughter comes, you understand that?

01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:08.566
I understand, I'm just here
to ask a few questions.

01:10:08.586 --> 01:10:12.879
There's nothing to talk about. You
shot and killed my son.

01:10:12.899 --> 01:10:15.654
And now you wanna get me tell
that he was a criminal?

01:10:15.674 --> 01:10:18.411
You can rot
in hell for me.

01:10:19.528 --> 01:10:23.521
Mrs. Rivera, please. I know
that your son was not a criminal.

01:10:23.687 --> 01:10:26.018
I'm trying to prove.

01:11:02.850 --> 01:11:04.632
What you got for me?

01:11:06.234 --> 01:11:09.011
Jacob lives with a female
on the West Side.

01:11:09.031 --> 01:11:13.061
Angela Flores or so.
Here is the address.

01:11:15.824 --> 01:11:18.389
Are you sure he's there?
Yes, he is.

01:11:18.409 --> 01:11:21.883
And they have a child, ok ??
So always be home.

01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:32.583
He now works as dagwerker.

01:11:34.379 --> 01:11:37.475
Do not worry, he's terrified.

01:11:38.878 --> 01:11:40.934
He will make no problems.

01:11:41.428 --> 01:11:42.948
I'm not worried about him.

01:11:50.507 --> 01:11:52.691
Would you like to earn $ 5000?

01:11:55.225 --> 01:11:57.464
What should I do?

01:11:59.547 --> 01:12:03.604
I still have a little problem you
maybe I can help.

01:12:18.936 --> 01:12:21.929
Is not it strange that no money
was found at the crime scene?

01:12:21.949 --> 01:12:25.178
No, fieldwork is rarely
according to the book.

01:12:25.242 --> 01:12:28.227
This whole operation was a disaster, sir.

01:12:28.247 --> 01:12:32.296
Five bad guys, two dead and arrested ?? n.
Fifty pounds Meth street.

01:12:32.316 --> 01:12:36.212
It was a disaster for the bad guys.
- Six.

01:12:41.064 --> 01:12:46.605
What?
- Six including the boy, Ramon.

01:12:47.099 --> 01:12:48.990
You said five.

01:12:49.796 --> 01:12:53.482
You know that Ramon Rivera nothing
that had to do with drug deal.

01:12:53.927 --> 01:12:56.887
I do not know for sure, detective.

01:12:57.598 --> 01:13:00.242
But I want to share something with you.

01:13:01.081 --> 01:13:05.531
We received many calls about this matter
but not one like this, sergeant.

01:13:08.046 --> 01:13:09.764
<I> I know who that boy has been shot. </ I>

01:13:09.784 --> 01:13:13.804

<I> Now they are after him
and also want to murder him. </ i>

01:13:25.513 --> 01:13:28.329
<I> He saw it. He saw
the cop who shot boy. </ i>

01:13:28.781 --> 01:13:30.607
Play it again off.

01:13:53.615 --> 01:13:56.056
Hello.

01:13:56.076 --> 01:13:58.081
Yes.

01:13:59.477 --> 01:14:03.538
Asking you to come to me?
- No.

01:14:04.686 --> 01:14:06.481
Let's go.

01:14:12.620 --> 01:14:14.134
This has never been used.
- Stop him.

01:14:14.154 --> 01:14:16.840
He never used.
- This is where I live.

01:14:16.860 --> 01:14:20.321
He never used. He can also do not to
one of us be traced,

01:14:21.810 --> 01:14:25.086

It's the last thing we should do.

01:14:25.194 --> 01:14:28.610
Ok ?? Then it's over.

What the hell is your problem?
I've done everything.

01:14:37.381 --> 01:14:40.258
All you have to do is
bastard shoot at loggerheads.

01:14:40.278 --> 01:14:42.597
Shoot him at loggerheads?
Should you hear yourself.

01:14:42.617 --> 01:14:45.965
I'm not a murderer.
- Yes?

01:14:46.417 --> 01:14:49.018
Tell that
against the mother of the boy.

01:14:49.563 --> 01:14:52.578
Get out you, I'm done.

01:14:53.887 --> 01:14:57.661
You're not finished with it when I say that.

01:15:06.172 --> 01:15:08.227

But you have to promise that you
my family will worry.

Where did you hide my whole life?

01:18:13.616 --> 01:18:16.211

01:18:18.804 --> 01:18:22.480
This is just fun for you, ok ??

01:18:33.979 --> 01:18:36.316
You fucking little whore.

01:19:26.575 --> 01:19:28.616
Mike?

01:19:41.648 --> 01:19:46.245
I'm really proud of you.
- This is only temporary.

01:19:46.414 --> 01:19:48.896
To earn a little more
and then we're gone.

01:19:56.644 --> 01:19:58.297
I love you.

01:20:02.251 --> 01:20:04.810

This guy was present at the drug deal.
What?

01:22:07.171 --> 01:22:10.757
Before the boy shot,

01:22:24.044 --> 01:22:25.867
Yes.

01:22:28.064 --> 01:22:30.075

01:22:41.091 --> 01:22:43.172
Mike, what are you doing?

01:22:48.936 --> 01:22:51.054
Miles is behind this.

My son.

01:26:45.517 --> 01:26:50.402
Dirty whore, put that door.

01:26:50.723 --> 01:26:52.342
Damn.

01:26:53.262 --> 01:26:54.820
Zooi sucks.

Now do the damn door, whore.

That's his car.

David?

01:27:21.292 --> 01:27:22.931
David?

01:27:25.943 --> 01:27:28.134

David, it's over, man.

01:30:19.156 --> 01:30:20.819
It's over.

01:30:21.905 --> 01:30:26.968
You go there lapping me, Mike?
I saved you.

01:30:28.128 --> 01:30:32.887
I've done all this for you.
- No David, you did it for the money.

01:30:33.982 --> 01:30:37.773
Yes, I know, other people know it.
You can not murder anyone.

01:30:39.555 --> 01:30:44.105
If you do this, we are both the dick.

01:30:44.503 --> 01:30:49.274
This will end. Blame it on me
it all makes me any more.

01:30:51.637 --> 01:30:56.003
I can not admit because I want
not sit, I can not.

01:30:56.023 --> 01:30:57.996
And neither do you.

01:31:00.062 --> 01:31:04.036
I shot the boy down.
It could have been my son

01:31:04.076 --> 01:31:05.866
And I can not live with.

01:31:15.588 --> 01:31:18.018
Do you think they'll let you go?

01:31:18.677 --> 01:31:21.336
Just because you've known?

01:31:24.400 --> 01:31:27.195
They will burn down your damn, Mike.

01:31:28.611 --> 01:31:30.250
That should then.

01:31:32.314 --> 01:31:35.159
I'm not gonna shoot you, man.

01:31:37.472 --> 01:31:39.142
You're my partner.

01:31:40.711 --> 01:31:43.118
But I must tell the truth.

01:31:50.279 --> 01:31:52.183
I must do it.

01:32:07.817 --> 01:32:09.744
I'm sorry, mate.

01:32:24.747 --> 01:32:26.751
I can not let you do that.

01:32:43.018 --> 01:32:46.674
Mike.

01:32:49.647 --> 01:32:52.432
Mike, stay with me.
Just keep breathing, okay ??

01:32:57.170 --> 01:33:00.384
It was an accident.
- I know.

01:33:01.692 --> 01:33:03.467
I know.

01:33:06.382 --> 01:33:09.433
Tell my son that I did the right thing.

01:33:11.934 --> 01:33:16.161
Do not go away, just breathe, okay ??

01:33:19.327 --> 01:33:21.992
God.

01:33:25.584 --> 01:33:27.287
Mike?

01:33:45.610 --> 01:33:50.481
This you bring me as your final report?
- Yes, sir.

01:33:53.759 --> 01:33:59.750
So you want me to believe that Detective Miles

01:34:00.450 --> 01:34:02.398
It's all in the report, sir.

01:34:02.418 --> 01:34:07.446
And you realize that the statements
Detective Gallo even contradicts it.

01:34:07.466 --> 01:34:09.212
Yes, I realize.

01:34:11.253 --> 01:34:17.057
And in that line, you commend the Gallo
family receives full compensation

01:34:17.077 --> 01:34:21.085
for his outstanding service
for this community

01:34:21.224 --> 01:34:22.911
Yes.

01:34:30.389 --> 01:34:33.682
Would you these facts
defend, detective?

01:34:47.290 --> 01:34:49.414
I can not but
then tell the truth, sir.

01:35:12.669 --> 01:35:17.578
I do not think we even longer
tax money to waste.

01:35:19.065 --> 01:35:22.958
I declare the case closed.
- Thank you, sir.
