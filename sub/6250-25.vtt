Whatever Agent Booth says,

01:20.331 --> 01:24.244
you respond with whatever
word or phrase pops
into your head, and vice versa.

01:24.335 --> 01:27.668

01:29.757 --> 01:33.249
No. This is a valuable
psychological tool, Agent Booth.

01:33.344 --> 01:36.928
When you respond viscerally,
we can get to the root
ofyour emotional issues...

01:37.014 --> 01:39.505

you two together as partners.

01:39.600 --> 01:42.091

Of course it is.

to explain but to respond, okay?

Why don’t you use Fisher and his discount sperm?

09:26.650 --> 09:30.734
No. Booth has a larger mandible
and a more prominent zygomatic
than Fisher,

09:30.821 --> 09:36.157
as well as a more pronounced
ratio between the width
of his clavicles and his ilia.

09:36.243 --> 09:39.110

[Exhales]

11:15.968 --> 11:17.879
[Tires Screeching]

11:17.970 --> 11:20.336
50 apparent/y
Ho/t’s wife was pregnant
when he disappeared

11:20.472 --> 11:24.340
So she’s
raising the child alone?
I guess so.

11:24.434 --> 11:26.345
You know, and no one thinks
twice about that.

11:26.436 --> 11:30.179
There are millions
of single women raising
healthy, productive children.

11:30.274 --> 11:35.234
There was a domestic
disturbance report filed
a month before he disappeared.

11:35.320 --> 11:39.359
Uh, you know,
ifwe go, uh, through
with this and, mmm—

11:39.449 --> 11:41.610
I’m around, and ifyou—
you need help—

11:41.743 --> 11:45.611
Well, I’ll have a nanny.
I-I figured. But you know,
if it’s her day off—

11:47.749 --> 11:50.582
You don’t have faith
that I can do it?
What? I didn’t say that.

11:50.711 --> 11:53.748
But you think I’d be
a good mother, don’t you?
Yeah, of course.

11:53.839 --> 11:56.501
I know sometimes
you don’t think I’m empathetic,

11:56.592 --> 12:01.006
and it can be difficult
for me sometimes.

12:01.096 --> 12:05.806
But I would love my child,
Booth. I would.

12:08.312 --> 12:10.849
I know.
I—I-I know that, Bones.

12:10.939 --> 12:13.225
I know people disapprove.

12:13.317 --> 12:16.354
Ifyou’re uncomfortable,
Fisher sells his sperm monthly.

12:16.486 --> 12:18.647
He’s very intelligent and—
Fisher? Ho-ho, no!

12:18.739 --> 12:20.650
You are not
having Fisher’s kids.

12:20.741 --> 12:23.323
You’d be givin’ birth
to the spawn of Satan,
okay? I’ll do it.

12:23.410 --> 12:27.198
N-No obligation.
I don’t want you
to feel any obligation.

12:27.289 --> 12:29.154
I’ll do it.
Don’t worry about it. Okay?

12:29.291 --> 12:31.452
It’s your kid.
It’s totally yours.
I’m not worried about it.

12:31.543 --> 12:33.499
I’mjust saying I will—
I’ll do it.

12:37.257 --> 12:40.249
You hold out hope,
but In my heart,
/ ’i/e known for months.

12:40.385 --> 12:42.842
What happened?
Well, we don’t know yet.
We’re still investigating.

12:42.930 --> 12:46.843
- He was found
at Bedford Creek Winery.
- At Bedford Creek.

12:46.934 --> 12:49.391
You been there?
I’m the wife
of a wme cn'tic.

12:49.478 --> 12:52.891
I’ve had to sit through tastings
at halfthe places
in the country.

12:52.981 --> 12:54.892
I don’t even like wine.

12:54.983 --> 12:57.645
- [ Baby Crying]
- Oh, God. I’m all covered.

12:57.736 --> 12:59.522
I’ll get her.
Bones—

12:59.613 --> 13:03.105
Spencer always wanted me
to give up
my carpentry business—

13:03.200 --> 13:05.407
saio’ / smelled of stain,

13:05.494 --> 13:07.405
ruined the bouquet
when he was tasting wine.

13:07.496 --> 13:09.236
Bones, you need help?

13:09.373 --> 13:11.238
[Crying Continues]
No, no. I’m fine.

13:11.375 --> 13:14.742
You gotta help with the—
Ah. Hey, hey.

13:14.878 --> 13:19.212
Geez.
You like spatial disorientation,
don’t you? Yes, you do.

13:19.299 --> 13:23.417
She likes you.
All Spencer could ever talk
about was having a little girl.

13:24.763 --> 13:27.675
He would’ve made a good father.

13:27.766 --> 13:29.882
Mmm. Mmm.
[Baby Fussing]

13:31.561 --> 13:36.726
Your husband also exhibited
a facial fracture
that hadn’t fully remodeled.

13:36.817 --> 13:40.309
Yes. He tried to break up
a fight at the wine expo.

13:40.404 --> 13:42.645
Mortenson was going after
Charles Dunwood.

13:42.739 --> 13:45.902
- Mortenson from Bedford Creek?
- He’s a real bastard.

13:46.034 --> 13:48.320
He and your husband
didn’t get along.
No.

13:48.412 --> 13:53.827
Mortenson loved him.
Spencer gave his cabernet a 99.
No one gets that.

13:53.917 --> 13:56.374
It was Charlie Dunwood
Mortenson hated,

13:56.461 --> 13:58.372
because Charlie made
a cheap wine next door...

13:58.463 --> 14:00.374
and he wouldn’t sell out
to Mortenson.

14:00.465 --> 14:02.672
And you saw this fight?
No.

14:02.759 --> 14:05.796
They all deny it, of course.
But Spencer told me about it.

14:08.473 --> 14:12.432
- [Baby Fuss/77g]
- There was a domestic
disturbance report...

14:12.519 --> 14:15.477
filed apprOXIma te/y one month
before your husband disappeared

14:15.564 --> 14:18.852
- Can you explain that?
- Our neighbor heard us arguing.

14:18.942 --> 14:21.149
That’s all.
She called the police.

14:21.236 --> 14:24.899
The report says
it was more than an argument,
Mrs. Holt.

14:24.990 --> 14:28.699
I threw some dishes—
but not at Spencer.

14:28.785 --> 14:31.618
/t was just
the pregnancy hormones,
you know?

14:31.705 --> 14:34.287
I would never hurt Spencer.

14:41.423 --> 14:43.334
[Brennan]
You don ’t belie ve
the victim’s wife?

14:43.425 --> 14:46.542
I just think we should check
with this guy Dunwood.
He might have a different story.

14:46.678 --> 14:49.795
What about the owner
of Bedford Creek Winery?
Mortenson is rich.

14:49.890 --> 14:51.926
Ifhe’s involved,
we don’t want to spook him...

14:52.017 --> 14:56.181
or he’sjust gonna hire
an army full of lawyers to come
make our lives miserable.

14:56.271 --> 14:59.138
Would you like legal protection?

14:59.274 --> 15:01.640
What?
With the child,

15:01.735 --> 15:05.273
so you feel secure
that I won’t be asking
for money or support.

15:05.363 --> 15:07.319
No. I-I don’t need
legal protection.

15:07.449 --> 15:09.531
But ifyou do—
I don’t.

15:09.618 --> 15:12.360
Okay. I’ve made an appointment
for you at the fertility clinic.

15:12.454 --> 15:17.949
They will check your semen
for motility, morphology,
sperm count.

15:18.043 --> 15:20.409
Whoa! My boys can swim.

15:20.504 --> 15:22.836
All right?
I have a child,
do you remember?

15:22.923 --> 15:24.834
This isn’t personal.

15:24.925 --> 15:28.417
I-I’d be remiss
ifI didn’t look at
an analysis ofyour semen.

15:28.512 --> 15:30.423
It’s a very simple process.

15:30.514 --> 15:33.597
You just go to the clinic,
give a sample.
It takes five minutes.

15:33.725 --> 15:36.842
They have pornography
ifyou need stimulus.
I get it.

15:36.937 --> 15:38.802
Okay.

15:40.649 --> 15:42.560
You really liked
holding that kid, didn’t you?

15:43.777 --> 15:45.813
Yeah.
Mmm.

15:45.904 --> 15:48.111
I’ve been thinking about
how exciting it will be...

15:48.198 --> 15:51.531
to expose my own child
to early pattern recognition.

15:52.869 --> 15:55.736
You know, they like
singing and, uh,

15:55.831 --> 15:57.742
when you make
funny faces at ’em too.

15:57.833 --> 16:01.542
Yeah, of course.
M will make
a diverse schedule.

16:11.888 --> 16:14.049
When it doesn ’t contain
human rema/ns,

16:14.141 --> 16:16.723
Bedford Creek
makes an excellent cab.

16:16.810 --> 16:20.394
Very full-bodied.
It’s like an Australian Shiraz.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.562
I only drink diet soda.

16:22.649 --> 16:25.732
I’m hoping the preservatives
can add some stability
to my life.

16:25.819 --> 16:28.105
There’s a little pocket knife...

16:29.573 --> 16:33.191
and some glass fragments
embedded in the fabric
from his shirt.

16:33.285 --> 16:36.243
There’s some scraping
on the anterior ofthis rib.

16:36.329 --> 16:38.445
I got a gouge
on the third rib...

16:38.540 --> 16:41.373
and one here
on the sternum.

16:41.501 --> 16:44.914
You think he was stabbed?
I can’t tell
from the incised edges...

16:45.005 --> 16:49.089
because the bones are soft
and completely stained
from soaking in the wine.

16:49.176 --> 16:52.714
Man, I can barely get
wine stains out of my shirt,
let alone a skeleton.

16:52.804 --> 16:55.841
But your shirt
isn’t composed of calcium.

16:55.932 --> 16:57.888
Oh, my God.

16:59.644 --> 17:01.680
I can clean them.

17:01.771 --> 17:04.478
This is weird.
Something good is happening.

17:04.608 --> 17:07.816
Take a deep breath.
I’m sure it’ll pass.
[Beeping]

17:07.903 --> 17:11.270
The approximate weight
ofthe bones is 12.43 kilograms.

17:11.364 --> 17:14.982
I’m gonna need
781 boxes ofdenture cleaner.

17:20.123 --> 17:23.081
A shame about Holt.
He was a good guy.

17:23.168 --> 17:25.500
One of the only critics
who didn’t dump on my wine.

17:25.587 --> 17:28.499
But your wine sells
for three dollars a bottle.

17:28.590 --> 17:31.707
That’s right, yeah.
In a bottle or a box.
It’s a good, honest drink.

17:31.801 --> 17:34.543
- It’s good.
- I didn’t know
you knew anything about wine.

17:34.638 --> 17:36.378
It’s good stuff.
It’s like the beer ofwine.

17:36.473 --> 17:38.555
Holt got that. He knew
I wasn’t trying to be more.

17:38.642 --> 17:41.600
Holt’s wife said that, um,

17:41.686 --> 17:45.975
he had to break up a fight
between you and Mortenson
from Bedford Creek Winery.

17:47.108 --> 17:49.019
Yeah. Yeah.

17:49.110 --> 17:53.103
It was at the wine expo,
in the parking lot.
I told Holt to stay out of it.

17:53.198 --> 17:55.860
I shoved Mortenson, all right?
The guy was in my face.

17:55.951 --> 17:58.488
Holt got in the middle
right when Mortenson
was taking a swing,

17:58.578 --> 18:00.489
so he took the hit.

18:00.580 --> 18:04.823
- Mortenson walked out,
/ust left him
- What was the fight about?

18:04.918 --> 18:08.081
My vineyard’s next door to his,
and he thinks
I’m an embarrassment.

18:08.171 --> 18:11.254
He wants to buy me out.
He threatened
some bogus lawsuits.

18:11.341 --> 18:13.798
My family’s
been working those fields
since 1928.

18:13.927 --> 18:17.590
This is my life.
So you had no issue
with Mr. Holt?

18:17.681 --> 18:21.265
Hell, no. No.
You know, if he were alive,
I’d pat him on the back.

18:21.351 --> 18:23.262
For what?

18:23.353 --> 18:25.389
For taking
that bastard Mortenson
down a peg.

18:25.522 --> 18:27.934
Yeah, but he loves
Bedford Creek Wine.
Yeah.

18:28.024 --> 18:31.687
But I heard he loves
sleeping with Mortenson’s wife
even more.

18:38.910 --> 18:41.287
Isthat
what I think it is?

18:41.371 --> 18:44.704
Were you thinking
sodium perborate
and potassium monopersulfate?

18:44.791 --> 18:47.203
Actually, I was thinking
Nana Shirley’s teeth.

18:47.294 --> 18:50.457
More like 781 sets
of Nana Shirley’s teeth.

18:50.547 --> 18:52.538
[ Hodgins ]
F/sher says this ’l/ remo ve
the sta/n/ng from the bones.

18:52.632 --> 18:54.338
Could I said “could.”

18:54.426 --> 18:58.715
There is no certainty but death
and the incomprehensible
conundrum that is life.

18:58.805 --> 19:02.639
Fisher, have you ever
just taken a moment
to forget yourself,

19:02.726 --> 19:04.682
watch, like, The Three Stooges
andjust laugh?

19:04.769 --> 19:07.431
Yeah. I never found humor
in grown men...

19:07.522 --> 19:11.106
giving each other concussions
with construction equipment.

19:11.192 --> 19:13.103
I tried.

19:13.194 --> 19:15.230
Tox screen
on the remnants of the liver
was inconclusive.

19:15.322 --> 19:17.404
Uh, the vinegar will obscure
just about everything.

19:17.490 --> 19:21.403
But / did find
some inorganic agents mixed in
with the l/ouef/ed tissue—

19:21.494 --> 19:23.405
could help us find
cause ofdeath.

19:23.496 --> 19:26.533
I think I found stab wounds
on the ribs and sternum.

19:26.624 --> 19:29.240
We’ll know more
ifwe can clean the stains.

19:33.590 --> 19:36.127
[ Woman ]
It’s quite s/mple.
You just ejaculate into the cup.

19:37.385 --> 19:40.001
Here we go, Mr. Booth.

19:40.096 --> 19:42.348
You look a little flushed.
Are you okay?

19:42.432 --> 19:44.343
Sure. Yeah, I’m fine.

19:44.434 --> 19:49.144
Sometimes men can feel awkward,
knowing people out there
know what you’re doing in here.

19:49.272 --> 19:52.856
Thanks for that.
[Clicks Tongue]
You know what to do.

19:52.942 --> 19:55.194
[Chuckles]
You’re kidding. right?

19:55.320 --> 19:58.187
Okay. There are magazines
and videos ifyou need ’em.
Mm-hmm.

19:58.281 --> 20:01.865
- Enjoy.
- [Door Closes]

20:01.951 --> 20:04.158
[Exhales]

20:05.455 --> 20:07.912
- Why are you here
at the bank, Booth?
- [Yelps]

20:07.999 --> 20:11.617
You’ve got a hot doctor friend.
Go to her and make
a direct deposit like a man!

20:12.587 --> 20:14.293
[Grunts]

20:17.050 --> 20:18.756
That’s impossible.

20:18.843 --> 20:21.801
- And yet we converse.
- Oh!

20:21.888 --> 20:24.630
Ooh, look. A pile of porn.
Delicious.

20:24.724 --> 20:28.308
Give me a peek, Booth, hmm?
/ust a little peek
at a booby, please?

20:29.896 --> 20:30.885
[Tl/Off]

20:30.980 --> 20:33.107

20:33.191 --> 20:37.355
What’s your problem?
You’re threatened by a cute,
harmless baby? Grow a set!

20:38.655 --> 20:40.941
You do want her
to have your baby,
don’t you?

20:41.032 --> 20:42.943
Of course I do. It’sjust—

20:43.034 --> 20:46.492
I want her to have a baby
because it’s what she wants.

20:46.579 --> 20:48.991
And you can just walk away
like a heartless cad...

20:49.082 --> 20:52.540
- while she changes poo
all by her lonesome?
- It’s what she wants!

20:52.627 --> 20:54.583
[Knocking]
[ Woman ] Are you okay
In there, Mr. Booth?

20:54.671 --> 20:57.128
Yeah. I’m fine.

20:57.215 --> 20:59.877
Just, uh, fine. Thank you.

20:59.968 --> 21:03.381
Listen.Just go away now, okay?
I don’t need your help.

21:03.471 --> 21:05.382
You know, you’re—
you’re not a bad-looking fellow,

21:05.473 --> 21:07.384
and ifyoujust
keep an open mind—

21:07.475 --> 21:10.057
Go back to cartoon land or
wherever you came from. Leave!

21:10.145 --> 21:12.807
You sure?
I’m good at pretend games.

21:18.778 --> 21:20.689
That was impossible.

21:27.912 --> 21:29.698
[Door Opens]

21:29.831 --> 21:31.787
Agent Booth?
Sweets, hey.

21:31.916 --> 21:34.168
How you doing?
I’m fine. Great.

21:34.252 --> 21:37.289
It turns out that, uh, the
victim might have been sleeping
with Mortenson’s wife, huh?

21:37.380 --> 21:39.041
Jealousy— always a good motive.

21:39.132 --> 21:43.125
Hmm. Yeah, that’s good.
But right now,
I’m more interested...

21:43.219 --> 21:45.175
in whether you decided
to inseminate Dr. Brennan.

21:45.263 --> 21:47.219
God. You know—
Don’t say it like that.

21:47.307 --> 21:49.468
I’m sorry. I’m interested
in whether you decided...

21:49.559 --> 21:52.346
to provide your semen
for her fertilization.

21:52.437 --> 21:54.393
- Saying it like that is worse.
- Okay.

21:54.481 --> 21:57.473
- I could go with “baby daddy,”
but that seems even more—
- I’m gonna do it.

21:57.567 --> 22:00.479
Heh. / We already
made the deposit.

22:00.570 --> 22:02.777
That’s right. Apparently,
I am a god.

22:02.864 --> 22:06.607
That’s right.
Motile sperm count,
28.8 million.

22:06.743 --> 22:09.359
I could start my own country.
Okay then.

22:09.454 --> 22:12.321
Well, I’m sure you’ll be going
through a lot ofemotional
changes because ofthis,

22:12.415 --> 22:14.076
so ifyou need to talk—

22:14.167 --> 22:16.749
Thank you.
But, um, it’s her baby,

22:16.836 --> 22:20.749
so it’s gonna be her life
that’s turned upside down,
not mine.

22:20.840 --> 22:22.376
So you’re not at all
stressed by this?

22:22.467 --> 22:24.503
Sweets, I’m an FBI. agent,
okay, and a former sniper.

22:24.594 --> 22:26.835
This is not
a life—or-death situation.
You understand?

22:26.930 --> 22:29.342
Yeah, sure.

22:29.432 --> 22:31.844
Well, ifyou need anything,
I’m available.

22:31.935 --> 22:34.722
I don’t need anything, okay?
I am just doing what, you know,

22:34.812 --> 22:37.599
anyone else would
in this situation, right?

22:39.651 --> 22:42.609
- [ Exhales]
- Uh— Like what?

22:45.365 --> 22:47.356
Ijust—

22:47.450 --> 22:51.534
I got a little, you know,
uh, anxious at the clinic.

22:51.621 --> 22:54.954
- Anxious.
- Anxious. Don’t get
all shrinky on me.

22:55.041 --> 22:57.783
No, no. Uh, what kind
of symptoms? Shortness
of breath, light-headed?

22:57.919 --> 23:00.410
It’s normal, right?
Absolutely.

23:00.505 --> 23:04.874
Sometimes donors can feel
an emotional attachment, even if
they don’t know the recipient.

23:04.968 --> 23:06.924
But in this case,
since you and Dr. Brennan are—

23:07.053 --> 23:10.216
It’s normal
to imagine things?
Well, not pink elephants, but—

23:10.306 --> 23:13.264
No. No, no. Of course not.
Like, um, baby things.

23:13.351 --> 23:15.216
It’d be odd
ifyou didn’t.

23:15.311 --> 23:17.688
Ha! It’d be odd ifI didn’t!
[Chuckles]

23:17.772 --> 23:21.185
You’re my guy.
That’s all I needed to hear.
Thanks, Sweets.

23:21.276 --> 23:23.813
Thanks. I gotta go,
uh, take care of something.

23:23.903 --> 23:25.609
No problem. Any time.

23:36.332 --> 23:39.665
There are tiny fractures
near the coronal sutures.

23:39.752 --> 23:41.663
We never would have
noticed these before.

23:41.754 --> 23:45.622
The denture cleaner
was an excellent idea,
Mr. Fisher.

23:45.717 --> 23:48.333
Now ifI only possessed
rudimentary social skills.

23:48.428 --> 23:51.170
Uh, they aren’t really necessary
for your work.

23:51.264 --> 23:53.505
I wish my parents were
that understanding.

23:55.768 --> 23:57.679
You’re gonna be
a good mother.

23:57.770 --> 24:00.147
I would imagine so.

24:00.231 --> 24:03.519
Evidence of hemorrhaging
on the underside
ofthe fractures.

24:03.610 --> 24:06.317
There was a perimortem
blow to the head.

24:13.536 --> 24:15.151
Okay.
[Beeps]

24:15.246 --> 24:17.908
Uh, Booth is waiting for me.
Check the degree of
hemorrhagic staining...

24:17.999 --> 24:19.910
to see if it was
cause ofdeath.

24:20.001 --> 24:22.788
- If Booth is still reluctant—
- No, he offered.

24:22.879 --> 24:26.542
28.8 million viable sperm
in a mere three milliliters
of ejaculate.

24:28.718 --> 24:32.085
As the feeling of inadequacy
makes me shrivel.

24:36.184 --> 24:38.470
Spencer Holt was a big supporter
of Bedford Creek Wines.

24:38.561 --> 24:40.426
He was here
for numerous tastings.

24:40.563 --> 24:42.645
Your little boy is adorable.
Oh, thank you.

24:42.732 --> 24:46.190

- Bones—

24:46.277 --> 24:48.268
Right. Sorry.

24:48.363 --> 24:53.653
So you were sleeping
with Spencer Holt, weren’t you?

24:53.785 --> 24:55.776
S u btle.
Sleep/ng with him?

24:55.870 --> 24:57.735
Of course not.
Who told you that?

24:57.830 --> 25:00.788
Seems like your husband
had, uh, quite the temper, huh?

25:00.875 --> 25:03.366
Charlie Dunwood, right?

25:03.461 --> 25:05.952
That is
not your husband’s child.

25:06.047 --> 25:08.880
What?
I think you should leave.

25:08.966 --> 25:13.426
- The bone markers bear a clear
resemblance to Spencer Holt.
- They do?

25:13.513 --> 25:17.631
Research shows that babies
strongly resemble their fathers
in the first year of life,

25:17.725 --> 25:21.183
the evolutionary theory
being that the y’re
less likely to be abandoned.

25:21.270 --> 25:24.637
- ifthe fathers recognize
themselves in their offspring.
- What is she talking about?

25:24.732 --> 25:27.144
Does that mean your kid
will look like me
for the first year?

25:27.235 --> 25:29.772
There’s a high statistical
probability, yes.

25:29.862 --> 25:32.114
Excuse me.
[ Fusses]

25:32.198 --> 25:34.689
I can compare these photos
against Spencer Holt’s remains.

25:34.784 --> 25:37.491
- The maxilla
and nasal aperture—
- Stop.

25:38.955 --> 25:40.866
My husband could come in
any moment.

25:40.957 --> 25:42.913
So it’s true?

25:45.670 --> 25:49.583
Sean and I tried.
It’s all about business
with him,

25:49.674 --> 25:52.211
but I really
wanted a child.

25:52.301 --> 25:56.635
Spencer understood,
and one night,
after a little too much wine—

25:58.683 --> 26:01.174
I appreciate everything
Sean does for me.

26:01.310 --> 26:05.349
But Spencer was,
you know—
Kind?

26:07.150 --> 26:09.186
I wish he had the chance
to see his child.

26:10.486 --> 26:12.397
So does his wife.

26:12.488 --> 26:15.321
Maybe your husband found out
that you were
having an affair...

26:15.408 --> 26:17.899
and, um, he decided
to get rid of Mr. Holt.

26:17.994 --> 26:22.363
Seems like the kind of guy
who likes to get what he wants.

26:22.457 --> 26:26.325
Sean has a temper,
but he would never hurt anyone.

26:26.419 --> 26:28.330
What the hell
are you doing, Kim?

26:28.421 --> 26:30.753
We werejust asking
a few questions
about Spencer Holt.

/ tried to talk to Brennan
about that whole baby thing.

26:44.729 --> 26:47.937
She won’t listen to me.
Neither will Booth.

26:48.024 --> 26:51.357

is board up the windows
and hope the levees hold.

- Exactly right.

27:06.125 --> 27:08.036
[Saroyan ]
Arsenic?
Yea h.

27:08.127 --> 27:10.243
It was on his clothes
and mixed in with the tissue.

27:10.379 --> 27:12.335
So he was poisoned?
Hmm.

27:12.423 --> 27:14.630
This isn’t a high enough
concentration to kill him.

27:14.717 --> 27:17.675
Booth said Holt’s wife
worked with wood,
building play sets.

27:17.762 --> 27:21.721
Arsenic is used in stains
and wood preservatives.
It’s tough to wash off.

27:21.808 --> 27:24.049
SoJenny Holt found out
her husband was cheating on her,

27:24.143 --> 27:28.056
stabbed mm and left us

27:39.534 --> 27:41.650
[On Speaker]
Spencer traveled a lot,

27:41.744 --> 27:45.487
visiting vineyards
across the country,
in Europe, South America.

27:45.581 --> 27:48.072
That’s why I waited to file
the Missing Persons report.

27:48.167 --> 27:51.000
He was missing for 10 days.
You didn’t talkto him
during that time?

27:51.087 --> 27:55.581
We had been having some trouble
in our marriage,
but we loved each other.

27:55.675 --> 27:58.917
You knew he was having an affair
with, uh, Kim Mortenson?

28:00.263 --> 28:03.881
Yes, I knew about Kim,

28:03.975 --> 28:06.341
but we would’ve gotten past it.

28:06.435 --> 28:10.178
When the baby was born,
we would have gotten closer,
like we had been.

28:10.273 --> 28:13.686
Did you know he was
the father of Kim’s baby too?

28:13.818 --> 28:15.979
What?
Yeah.

28:16.070 --> 28:18.311
No. That’s impossible.

28:18.406 --> 28:20.647
Kno wmg that he was
having an affair is one th/ng,

28:20.741 --> 28:23.073
but knowing
he fathered another child
while you were pregnant,

28:23.160 --> 28:25.071
that would put anyone
over the edge.

28:25.162 --> 28:30.498
I didn’t kill Spencer.
I loved him.

28:32.962 --> 28:38.457
In your work, um, do you use
stains or wood preservatives
that contain arsenic?

28:38.551 --> 28:40.667
There are traces, yes.

28:40.761 --> 28:44.174
Arsenic was found
on his clothes, in his wounds,
in an amount...

28:44.265 --> 28:47.883
that could easily have been
transferred from the assailant
during an attack.

28:47.977 --> 28:51.595
Why would I leave my little girl
without a father?

28:51.689 --> 28:53.805
Why would I do that to her?

28:53.900 --> 28:55.811
Where were you for the 10 days
he went missing?

28:57.153 --> 29:00.941
That was months ago.
I couldn’t tell you.
No one could.

29:03.492 --> 29:07.110
All ofthe injuries
to the ribs and sternum
had silica embedded in them...

29:07.204 --> 29:09.160
which matched
all ofthe glass shards...

29:09.248 --> 29:11.739
found in the wine cask
and on Holt’s clothes.

29:11.834 --> 29:15.326
Yes. These injuries
to the ribs and sternum—

29:15.421 --> 29:17.787
Can you connect
the impact points?

29:17.882 --> 29:21.670
Why? You think Holt’s wife
was making a design
when she was attacking him?

29:21.761 --> 29:26.596
There are three
ma/n impact p0/nts. What if
they were a circular pattern ?

29:26.682 --> 29:30.470
Okay. Well, a circumference—

29:30.561 --> 29:33.018
A circle is
nine and a halfinches.

29:33.105 --> 29:35.187
What is the circumference
ofa wine bottle?

29:36.651 --> 29:39.393
[Snorts]
My guess,
nine and a halfinches.

29:39.487 --> 29:41.023
[Ange/a ]
Yeah. 1 et ’5 see.

29:43.741 --> 29:45.652
Yep. Nine and a halfinches.

29:45.743 --> 29:47.654
Okay.
Get some Bedford Creek Wine.

29:47.745 --> 29:50.236
See ifthe bottle was sufficient
to cause these injuries...

29:50.331 --> 29:54.324
and hemorrhagic staining
at the coronal suture.

29:54.418 --> 29:58.582
You know, a watermelon
is the same density
as the human head.

29:58.673 --> 30:01.210
Oh, I like
the way you think, Fisher.

30:01.300 --> 30:03.791
I have an appointment with
a fertility specialist next week.

30:03.886 --> 30:07.299

within a month.

30:08.307 --> 30:10.218
ReaHy?
Mm-hmm.

30:10.309 --> 30:14.143
- You didn’t tell Agent Booth?
- I promised him he wouldn’t
have to be involved.

30:14.230 --> 30:16.767
Right. Exactly. You see?
Because we have an arrangement.

30:16.857 --> 30:18.768
Well, I thought that
these sessions were meant...

30:18.859 --> 30:21.145
for you to see
how we interact as partners

30:21.237 --> 30:23.148
How does this relate?

30:23.239 --> 30:25.651
You’re using Agent Booth
to have a child.

30:25.741 --> 30:27.777
You don’t see how
that might relate
to your partnership?

30:27.868 --> 30:30.245
Has nothing to do
with our work.

30:30.329 --> 30:33.446
Wow. Okay, um—

30:33.541 --> 30:35.953
Let mejust
organize my thoughts here.

30:36.043 --> 30:39.581
It’s not like I’m going to be
bringing the child along
when we interrogate someone.

30:39.672 --> 30:42.459
Ah, but you might decide
to breast-feed.
It is healthier.

30:42.591 --> 30:44.252
Oh, that’s true.
Mm—hmm.

30:44.343 --> 30:47.756
So yes, there might be some
crossover. I can see that now.
I’m sorry. Go on.

30:49.932 --> 30:53.720
I think you need
to acknowledge...

30:53.811 --> 30:55.972
that there are some
emotional considerations...

30:56.063 --> 30:57.974
that you might be denying.

30:58.065 --> 31:00.306
Like... what?

31:00.401 --> 31:03.359
There are sperm banks
that guarantee high I.Q.’s...

31:03.446 --> 31:05.437
and exceptional
physical prowess,

31:05.531 --> 31:07.647
yet you speciﬁcally chose
Agent Booth.

31:07.742 --> 31:09.733
Why?

31:09.827 --> 31:13.115
He has traits like courage...

31:13.205 --> 31:16.413
and compassion and empathy...

31:16.500 --> 31:18.752
that would be tremendous assets
to my child.

31:18.836 --> 31:20.747
Sperm banks don’t catalog
those traits.

31:20.838 --> 31:23.124
Did youjust say
something nice?

31:23.215 --> 31:26.127
No, I gave
an objective evaluation.

31:26.218 --> 31:29.335
Oh. Because, sounded like
you said something nice.

31:29.430 --> 31:32.718
- No.
- How can you two not see
what’s going on here?

31:32.808 --> 31:35.470
Sweets, what is the big deal?
She was gonna have
a baby anyway.

31:35.561 --> 31:38.268
I mean, with Fisher.
Fisher! Okay?
What would you have done?

31:38.355 --> 31:41.973
Again, what I would’ve done
is not important, but you
admitted to feelings ofanxiety.

31:42.068 --> 31:45.231
Look. You know what, Sweets?
You are crossing a line
right there.

31:45.321 --> 31:47.653
- I agree.
- No, I’m not actually.

31:47.740 --> 31:49.947
In my position,
I could make an evaluation...

31:50.034 --> 31:52.491
that states that you two
are not suited
to work together...

31:52.578 --> 31:55.445
because of interpersonal issues
that are not be/ng dealt with.

31:55.539 --> 31:58.121
- [Scoffs]
Ridiculous.
- Dreamer.

31:58.209 --> 32:00.120
50 perhaps
until our next session,

32:00.211 --> 32:02.998
maybe you should think about
some ofthe things
that I brought up today.

32:06.675 --> 32:08.882
[ Hodgins ]
Hmm. It’s conﬁrmed
by the modeling.

32:08.969 --> 32:11.255
Yep, the shards ofglass
found in the cask...

32:11.347 --> 32:14.714
have the same thatch design
as the base of
the Bedford Creek bottles.

32:14.809 --> 32:17.175
So we know the bottle
was from Bedford Creek.

32:17.269 --> 32:19.646
Then we don’t have to do
the experiment.

32:22.316 --> 32:25.183
We have all the melons already,
you know, and the bottles.

32:25.277 --> 32:26.813
Confirmation
would be beneficial.

32:26.946 --> 32:29.232
We’d be remiss
ifwe didn’t confirm.
Yeah.

32:32.034 --> 32:34.195
Sorry, Mr. Holt.

32:35.830 --> 32:38.367

That bottle
was supposed to break.

32:38.457 --> 32:40.493
Yeah, othen/vise
the injuries make no sense.

32:40.584 --> 32:44.168
You’re sure a melon
has the same density
as a human head?

32:44.255 --> 32:47.668
Would I waste our time?
Give me that.

32:50.219 --> 32:52.710
I enjoyed that too much,
didn’t I?

32:52.805 --> 32:54.511
It’s important
to love your work.

32:54.598 --> 32:57.385
Maybe she hit him
with the narrow end.

33:00.604 --> 33:03.937
- She was a carpenter.
More strength.
-Mmm

33:18.330 --> 33:21.413
- Would you like a towel?
- Very much.

33:23.919 --> 33:26.956
The Bedford Creek bottles,
they wou/dn ’t ha ve broken.

33:27.047 --> 33:29.663
But it would’ve
smashed his skull.

33:29.758 --> 33:32.591
But you said the design
you found on the glass...

33:32.678 --> 33:35.761
confirmed that it was
a Bedford Creek bottle.

33:35.848 --> 33:40.683
Yeah, but these bottles
wouldn’t have provided
the injuries that we found.

33:40.769 --> 33:45.058

we have no weapon
or ca use of dea th ?

33:55.784 --> 33:57.649
Oops.

34:00.706 --> 34:05.166
Dio’ you ever think what ifBooth
Is the perfect father
for your child?

34:05.252 --> 34:07.743
Notjust his stuff, but him.

34:07.838 --> 34:10.045
What ifyou’re throwing away
the chance to have a family,

34:10.132 --> 34:12.464
a real family,
because you’re scared?

34:12.551 --> 34:16.794
Scared? Why would I be scared?
I’ve been to Rwanda, to Iraq.

34:16.889 --> 34:21.679
Listen. You said
you wanted to do this alone
because feelings are ephemeral.

34:21.769 --> 34:23.680
So is life, Brennan.

34:23.771 --> 34:26.137
We’re here one minute
and then we’re gone the next.

34:26.232 --> 34:28.518
You should know that
better than anybody.

34:28.609 --> 34:33.353
Ifyou keep living,
trying to protect yourself,
nothing is ever gonna touch you.

34:33.447 --> 34:36.280
Sweets said
that it’s not hisjob
to tell somebody...

34:36.367 --> 34:38.733
what they’re feeling
or how they should live
their life.

34:38.827 --> 34:42.194
Lucky thing I’m not a shrink.

34:42.331 --> 34:44.913
The bottles were counterfeit.
Counterfeit?

34:45.000 --> 34:48.663
Yep. Even though
the design was the same,
the glass found in the cask...

34:48.754 --> 34:51.086
had a lower concentration
ofdolomite
and magnesium dioxide...

34:51.173 --> 34:53.084
than the real
Bedford Creek bottles.

34:53.175 --> 34:55.507
Someone’s been counterfeiting
Bedford Creek cabernet.

34:55.594 --> 34:58.051
A bottle of Bedford Creek
sells for over a hundred bucks.

34:58.138 --> 35:01.130
So if someone fills counterfeit
bottles with cheap wine...

35:01.225 --> 35:03.682
and sh/ps out
a couple thousand cases,
saying it’s ﬁom Bedford Creek,

35:03.769 --> 35:06.351
they can make
some serious money.

35:06.438 --> 35:08.349
Yeah, exactly.
Now I also found...

35:08.440 --> 35:12.149
that the arsenic compound
I thought was from the stain
contained parathion.

35:13.737 --> 35:15.398
Okay We don ’t kno w
what that means.

35:15.489 --> 35:18.105
It’s an organophosphate
used as an Insect/c/o’e.

35:18.200 --> 35:21.943
The only vineyard in the area
licensed to use it by the EPA.
is Dunwood Winery.

[Door Opens]

35:31.213 --> 35:35.832
We found cases ofthis
in your warehouse.

35:35.926 --> 35:38.303
You were counterfeiting
Bedford Creek wine.

35:38.387 --> 35:41.504
You charged a hundred dollars
fora three-dollar—wine.

35:41.598 --> 35:44.385
Stupid wine snobs.
They don’t even
know the difference.

35:44.518 --> 35:46.429
But Holt did.
Mm-hmm.

35:46.520 --> 35:50.012
He found out, didn’t he?
He was going to tell Mortenson.

35:50.107 --> 35:53.019
It was none of Holt’s business.
I told him to stay out of it.

35:53.110 --> 35:55.351
/needed the money to ﬁght
Mortenson ’s bogus lawsuits.

35:55.446 --> 35:57.482
I wasn’t gonna let
that bastard take my place.

35:57.573 --> 35:59.814
My family has been there
for over 80 years.

[Stew/e ]
Is this man a complete dunce?

36:05.831 --> 36:09.119
- Oh, God.
- Booth, what is it?

36:09.209 --> 36:13.327
Why doesn ’t he just clam up
and ask for a la via/er?
You, sir, are a boob!

36:13.422 --> 36:15.333
Because some people,
theyjust feel remorse...

36:15.424 --> 36:17.380
and they want to
set the record straight.

36:17.468 --> 36:20.756
Oh, please. He makes wine
a homeless person
wouldn’t cook with.

36:20.846 --> 36:22.757
He never felt remorse
about that.

36:22.848 --> 36:25.681
Nobody asked you.

36:25.768 --> 36:28.225
- Booth, who are you talking to?
- What’s goin’ on?

36:31.357 --> 36:33.894
Nothing.Just, um, go on.

36:33.984 --> 36:39.695
/ fol/o wed him to Mortenson ’s.
He had one of the bottles,
and it was late, and—

36:39.782 --> 36:43.195
And you cornered him
in the wine cellar and beat him
to death to shut him up.

36:43.285 --> 36:46.027
- Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
We know.
- Will you shut up? Shut up!

36:46.121 --> 36:47.986
Booth, who are you talking to?

36:48.082 --> 36:50.915
So are you gonna let her
have this baby alone?

36:51.001 --> 36:53.378
- I didn’t say that.
- You are!

36:53.462 --> 36:55.794
You’re going to abandon

36:55.881 --> 36:59.169
Oh, night’s deepest gloom
washes over my tiny frame.

36:59.259 --> 37:01.250
No, no. I can’t walk away.
I never said that.

37:01.345 --> 37:04.382

I can’t walk away.

You were seeing something
in there. What were you seeing?

Stewie. You know,
the baby from the Family Guy.

37:38.799 --> 37:42.257

in the interrogation room?

about the kid?
Fine. I won’t have a baby.

- No, it is.

you saw Luc Robitaille...

ofa dead friend
and now a cartoon baby.

- No! No, I’m not.

to forget that?

either one of us
could’ve stopped it.
