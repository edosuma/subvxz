00:14.194 --> 00:17.186

working in your bagel shop

00:17.297 --> 00:18.991

00:23.970 --> 00:26.564

Oh, God.

00:48.196 --> 00:49.424
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be fine.

00:49.530 --> 00:50.656
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be fine.

00:50.764 --> 00:52.096
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be fine.

00:52.200 --> 00:53.497
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be fine.

00:53.601 --> 00:55.501
I'm gonna get help. Hold on. Just...

00:55.903 --> 00:57.394
Hold on. Hold on.

00:57.506 --> 00:58.995
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be fine.

00:59.106 --> 01:00.597
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be...

01:27.903 --> 01:30.963
Morning again, Mr. Chambers.
You've been a busy man.

01:31.073 --> 01:32.541
I signed you in two hours ago.

01:32.842 --> 01:34.604
Most people
are just prying their eyelids open,

01:34.710 --> 01:36.611
and you've already been out
causing trouble.

01:36.713 --> 01:37.702
Right.

01:37.880 --> 01:38.848
Have a good one.

01:44.020 --> 01:45.920
You have a 9:30
with the Legislative Affairs team

01:46.022 --> 01:47.580
to discuss the Gulf Coast initiative.

01:47.690 --> 01:49.783
The advance briefing is on your desk,
and then at 10:00,

01:49.893 --> 01:50.882
the Vice President
would like you to join her

01:50.994 --> 01:53.554
for the prayer breakfast, and then...

02:30.802 --> 02:32.268
- Quinn?
- Thank you.

02:32.370 --> 02:33.598
Thank you for coming.
I didn't know what to do.

02:33.705 --> 02:35.935
I'm sorry. I didn't know. I'm sorry.
I was gonna call 911,

02:36.041 --> 02:37.474
and then he...

02:37.576 --> 02:38.976
Quinn, who else have you called?

02:39.278 --> 02:41.541
You. Just you, because whoever
killed Gideon, he's out there.

02:41.646 --> 02:43.773
We should call the police. We should.
The police have to be called.

02:43.882 --> 02:45.851
- Quinn, we can't call the police.
- Why, why, why? He's dead.

02:45.952 --> 02:47.179
When someone's dead,
you call the police.

02:47.285 --> 02:48.810
You and I both know
why we can't call the police.

02:48.921 --> 02:51.218
What? He's dead. Why can't we?
We have to. Why?

02:51.324 --> 02:54.292
Because if we call the police,
they'll find out who you really are.

Cyrus.

03:13.179 --> 03:15.273
James wants to adopt
an Ethiopian baby.

03:15.948 --> 03:17.712
- That's good.
- It is. It is good,

03:17.818 --> 03:18.842
but I've been fighting him on it,

03:18.952 --> 03:21.853
been making all sorts of excuses
about why it's not a good idea.

03:22.255 --> 03:24.223
I'm not a young man.
I work crazy hours.

03:24.324 --> 03:26.259
Once you have a kid,
your life's no longer your own.

03:26.361 --> 03:27.554
The usual suspects.

03:27.661 --> 03:30.425
The whole thing was off the table,
at least until last night.

03:31.832 --> 03:33.857
- Last night?
- Yeah, last night,

03:33.967 --> 03:36.528
when I went looking
for the President of the United States

03:36.638 --> 03:38.730
and found out
that he was at his girlfriend's house.

03:42.010 --> 03:43.034
Here it comes.

03:43.845 --> 03:44.811
Cyrus the holy.

03:44.911 --> 03:47.039
You tell me to go to war
with Olivia Pope,

03:47.148 --> 03:49.548
then you spend the night with her.
Are you out of your mind?

03:49.651 --> 03:51.016
What did you do,
throw pebbles at her window,

03:51.285 --> 03:53.116
hide under her bed
while her mom and dad

03:53.221 --> 03:54.347
came by her room, said good night?

03:54.455 --> 03:56.923
- All right. That's enough.
- Why did you even run for this job,

03:57.025 --> 03:58.584
to get laid?
You couldn't get laid as Governor?

03:58.694 --> 04:01.219
Get out of my office.

04:01.330 --> 04:03.820
What you did last night
was stupid and reckless!

04:03.931 --> 04:06.695
You want to know what I gave up
to put you here in this office,

04:06.801 --> 04:08.565
what I've done for you,
the ends that I've gone to?

04:08.671 --> 04:10.433
- Lf you had any idea...
- I am so sick

04:10.539 --> 04:12.769
of you saying you put me
in the White House.

04:12.908 --> 04:16.105
I got myself elected.
I put myself in the White House.

04:16.211 --> 04:18.007
You were a flyboy
with a good head of hair

04:18.113 --> 04:20.809
- and a pushy dad.
- I'm sorry if the girl that you hired,

04:20.916 --> 04:23.852
the girl you mentored,
the girl you brought in to save the day,

04:23.953 --> 04:26.615
your girl, fell in love with me.

04:28.791 --> 04:30.191
That must really eat at you, Cy.

04:32.061 --> 04:34.587
- You don't deserve this job.
- And yet here I am!

04:35.297 --> 04:36.822
Sorry to interrupt, Mr. President.

04:36.933 --> 04:38.730
It's the cult situation in Georgia.

04:38.834 --> 04:41.998
Three ATF agents
were just shot near the compound.

04:46.710 --> 04:48.200
She's our client.
We barely know her.

04:48.311 --> 04:50.108
No, she's an employee.
Who we barely know.

04:50.213 --> 04:51.180
And now she's our client.

04:51.281 --> 04:52.340
There is a dead reporter
on the floor.

04:52.450 --> 04:53.814
Can we have this conversation
someplace else?

04:53.917 --> 04:56.352
I don't know why we're
not calling it in. I'll dial 911 right now.

04:56.454 --> 04:57.784
We can't do that.
Why not?

04:57.887 --> 04:59.651
I'm gonna have to ask you
to not move.

04:59.757 --> 05:00.780
- Huh?
- You're leaving footprints.

05:01.425 --> 05:03.256
If we call the police,
there's gonna be a problem for Quinn.

05:03.360 --> 05:04.657
- What problem?
- She can't be photographed,

05:04.762 --> 05:06.491
booked or fingerprinted
in any official capacity.

05:06.597 --> 05:08.428
She cannot be connected
to the crime scene in any way.

05:08.599 --> 05:11.000
- Why not?
- Her name isn't actually Quinn Perkins.

05:11.402 --> 05:12.664
Who the hell
is she?

05:12.770 --> 05:14.238
She's our client. That's who she is.

05:14.339 --> 05:16.033
That's all I need to tell you.
That's all you need to know.

05:16.140 --> 05:17.699
She's our client,
and she needs our help.

05:17.809 --> 05:19.537
What are we supposed to do?
She's covered in blood.

05:19.643 --> 05:20.702
Her fingerprints are everywhere.

05:20.812 --> 05:22.745
How do you think
we're getting her out of here?

05:25.916 --> 05:27.043
- I'm gonna want hands covered.
- No way!

05:27.219 --> 05:29.779
I am an officer of the court.
So is Harrison. So is Abby. So is Liv.

05:29.888 --> 05:32.721
Okay, if we're doing this,
we're destroying all the evidence.

05:32.824 --> 05:33.950
You realize what this means, Liv?

05:34.059 --> 05:35.253
I've been to prison,

05:35.460 --> 05:37.189
- and I'm not going back.
- You were in prison for three days.

05:37.295 --> 05:39.389
It was prison! Who are you?

05:39.499 --> 05:41.022
No! Do not. She's our client.

05:41.133 --> 05:42.897
Hey! No moving.

05:43.302 --> 05:44.325
We can't leave her here.

05:44.436 --> 05:45.425
Okay, I'm gonna want you to say it,

05:45.537 --> 05:47.267
because once you say this,
there's no going back.

05:47.373 --> 05:49.500
The police will never be able
to find Gideon's killer.

05:49.742 --> 05:51.937
His murder never gets solved.

06:01.688 --> 06:03.052
We clean it.

06:04.123 --> 06:05.091
Oh!

06:11.598 --> 06:12.587
Take 'em or leave 'em?

06:12.699 --> 06:13.687
- Did you touch them?
- What?

06:13.800 --> 06:15.666
- Did you touch the scissors?
- I pulled them out of his neck.

06:15.769 --> 06:16.826
- Take 'em.
- What's happening?

06:16.936 --> 06:18.199
- I think they had sex.
- What's happening?

06:18.305 --> 06:20.000
- Did you sleep with Gideon last night?
- What's happening?

06:20.140 --> 06:21.630
If you did,
your DNA could be on the sheets.

06:21.742 --> 06:23.209
- We'll need to take them. Did you?
- I don't understand.

06:23.310 --> 06:24.277
I found some clothes. I think they'll fit.

06:24.378 --> 06:26.175
I'm gonna need you to change
the clothes that you're wearing.

06:26.280 --> 06:27.838
Found some research here
about Amanda Tanner,

06:27.948 --> 06:29.279
a laptop computer. We should take it.

06:29.449 --> 06:31.144
- What?
- You'll need to remove your clothes.

06:31.251 --> 06:33.982
Judging by lividity,
he's been dead less than two hours.

06:34.088 --> 06:35.987
They had sex and ate grilled cheese.
I bagged that, too.

06:36.089 --> 06:37.785
- Can someone...
- Your clothes. They're covered in blood.

06:37.892 --> 06:39.256
Your shoes, too.
I'm gonna need you to take 'em off.

06:39.359 --> 06:40.987
Put on this T-shirt and sweatpants.

06:41.095 --> 06:42.288
No moving! Right here.

06:42.597 --> 06:43.859
- What?
- Quinn, I'm sorry, but...

06:43.965 --> 06:45.830
Please do not spread your DNA
any further.

06:45.934 --> 06:47.561
- Just change right here.
- I don't understand.

06:47.669 --> 06:49.830
Look, you have to change,
and it has to be now, okay?

06:49.938 --> 06:52.237
You're the client. No one's looking.

06:52.474 --> 06:54.498
- These are...
- Gideon's clothes.

06:54.609 --> 06:56.305
I'm sorry,
but you're gonna have to put 'em on.

07:21.538 --> 07:22.504
We ready?
We're good.

07:22.605 --> 07:23.572
- We sure?
- We're good.

07:23.672 --> 07:25.038
- What's happening?
- We're cleaning the scene.

07:25.141 --> 07:27.473
- You were never here. Let's go.
- We can't just leave him here like that

07:27.577 --> 07:29.544
- on the floor by himself.
- Do you know what we just did for you?

07:29.645 --> 07:31.113
Do you know what's happening,
what this could do to us?

07:31.214 --> 07:32.908
He'll be all alone.

07:35.185 --> 07:37.380
<i>911,
- Hello. I'm at 2950 Prospect Street.</i>

07:37.487 --> 07:38.886
I'd like to report a murder.

07:38.989 --> 07:39.978
<i>- What?
- A murder.</i>

07:40.257 --> 07:42.225
- Everybody out.
- Wait, wait, wait.

07:42.325 --> 07:43.622
- What?
- Did anybody get his cell phone?

07:43.727 --> 07:45.661
- What?
- His cell phone. Anybody find it?

07:45.762 --> 07:46.787
- We don't need to...
- We need it!

07:46.898 --> 07:48.728
I already called the police.
We have maybe eight minutes

07:48.832 --> 07:50.732
- before they arrive on the scene.
- He's 202. Quinn?

07:50.834 --> 07:52.427
555-0196.

07:56.307 --> 07:57.774
- Where is it?
- We're running out of time.

07:58.375 --> 07:59.707
I got it. It's there. It's in his pocket.

07:59.810 --> 08:01.277
- Get it.
- I'm not getting it.

08:03.881 --> 08:05.110
Let's go.

08:21.566 --> 08:24.330
For you, when you get the chance.

08:25.103 --> 08:26.730
Well, aren't you going to join us
for prayer breakfast?

08:26.905 --> 08:28.236
No, I've got a full plate this morning.

08:28.373 --> 08:30.603
Mention me in your prayers, though.
I'll take all I can get.

08:31.843 --> 08:33.140
Everything okay today, Billy?

08:33.278 --> 08:34.506
Well, why wouldn't it be?

08:34.613 --> 08:36.274
I've got the greatest job in the world,

08:36.381 --> 08:37.905
giving a voice to people
who don't have one,

08:38.015 --> 08:41.850
people who depend on us every day
to make this country better for them.

08:41.986 --> 08:43.818
We're blessed
to be doing what we're doing.

08:43.923 --> 08:45.651
Someone give this man a raise
and a pulpit.

08:47.126 --> 08:49.617
Working for you has been
reward enough, Madam President.

08:56.202 --> 08:57.999
All right. Gideon Wallace.
What do we know?

08:58.104 --> 08:59.628
The last couple of weeks,
he's been working on a story

08:59.739 --> 09:00.763
- about Amanda Tanner.
Obviously,

09:00.907 --> 09:02.102
he got too close to something,

09:02.209 --> 09:03.505
got a pair of scissors
in the neck for his trouble.

09:03.609 --> 09:06.204
He figured out who sent her
to sleep with the President.

09:06.313 --> 09:08.747
Somebody sent Amanda in
to sleep with the President?

09:08.849 --> 09:09.816
How do we know that part?

09:11.552 --> 09:12.985
- We just do.
- But how do we just do?

09:13.087 --> 09:14.816
I don't think it's important.
Let's move on.

09:14.922 --> 09:18.483
Gideon made 28 phone calls last night,
all D.C. And Virginia area codes.

09:18.592 --> 09:20.059
The last call
was to the White House switchboard.

09:20.160 --> 09:21.320
So he was trying to call
one of these people.

09:21.428 --> 09:23.623
"Boyfriend lives in Logan Circle. "
Amanda had a boyfriend?

09:23.731 --> 09:26.291
- Who works at the White House.
- That's our guy. What about his laptop?

09:26.400 --> 09:27.959
He was on it most of the night
looking at videos.

09:28.069 --> 09:29.626
It's gonna take me a few hours
to go through it all.

09:29.737 --> 09:31.535
Abby and Stephen,
call every number on that pad.

09:31.639 --> 09:33.834
- Harrison, follow up on the addresses.
- I can help.

09:34.776 --> 09:37.711
I'd rather be doing something, anything.
Let me help.

09:37.846 --> 09:40.576
You can help by sitting on that chair
and not moving.

09:40.682 --> 09:42.775
You're the client, Quinn.
Let us do our job.

09:45.220 --> 09:47.552
<i>At 9:30 this morning, gunfire erupted</i>

09:47.655 --> 09:50.624
outside the Heaven's Rapture
compound in Hacklene, Georgia.

09:50.759 --> 09:52.386
Three ATF agents were wounded,

09:52.494 --> 09:54.587
though I can confirm
that they're now in stable condition.

09:55.563 --> 09:58.054
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Folks, please.

09:58.166 --> 10:00.362
Please. One at a time.
It's been a long morning. Yes.

10:00.469 --> 10:02.334
What course of action
can we expect from the President...

10:02.438 --> 10:04.463
- It's a crazy world we live in, Ted.
- What?

10:04.573 --> 10:06.438
You're gonna want to get this next part
loud and clear.

10:06.542 --> 10:08.134
Vice President Langston
and Attorney General Sawyer

10:08.244 --> 10:09.643
- are determined not to use force.
- Excuse me.

10:09.745 --> 10:11.975
That doesn't mean they're not going to,

10:12.081 --> 10:13.343
- and as to further details...
- Excuse me.

10:13.449 --> 10:14.438
- I can't tell you anything new.
- Excuse me.

10:14.550 --> 10:16.541
We have a couple of options here.

10:16.652 --> 10:18.746
If we go in through the back
of the compound,

10:18.855 --> 10:22.256
that will give us the easiest access
to the schoolhouse building.

10:22.359 --> 10:25.795
Our satellite images confirm
that the adjacent armory

10:25.896 --> 10:27.522
is accessible through an unarmed

10:27.631 --> 10:28.791
- rooftop doorway.
- Holy crap.

10:30.266 --> 10:33.259
The President is determined
not to use...

10:34.538 --> 10:36.563
- Billy?
- Sorry about your morning, Marv.

10:36.673 --> 10:37.970
It's about to get longer.

10:38.642 --> 10:41.611
Good morning, everyone.
My name is William David Chambers,

10:41.878 --> 10:44.540
and for the past 14 months,
I've had the great honor

10:44.648 --> 10:47.641
to serve Vice President Sally Langston
as her Chief of Staff,

10:47.919 --> 10:50.444
so it is with deep sadness and regret

10:50.755 --> 10:54.885
that I will resign my position officially,
effective immediately.

10:55.592 --> 10:59.620
Now I've prayed long and hard
for a solution to the painful situation

10:59.730 --> 11:04.292
I find myself in, but I've come up short.

11:04.402 --> 11:07.667
Now the Bible tells us,
"A false witness will not go unpunished,

11:07.772 --> 11:10.605
"and he who pours out lies will perish. "

11:10.708 --> 11:13.473
So I will take what little solace I can
this morning

11:13.578 --> 11:16.742
by simply telling the truth,
and the truth is this.

11:17.116 --> 11:20.812
I had an affair with a White House aide
named Amanda Tanner.

11:22.688 --> 11:24.713
Gideon had it narrowed down
to 57 male employees

11:24.823 --> 11:26.415
- in the West Wing.
- He's on TV right now.

11:26.525 --> 11:27.959
I want blood types on everyone.

11:28.060 --> 11:29.687
If we cross match them
to the coroner's report...

11:29.795 --> 11:31.058
Find Amanda's baby daddy,
find Gideon's murderer.

11:31.164 --> 11:32.357
- He's on TV right now.
- It's a twofer.

11:32.464 --> 11:34.194
He's on TV right now!

11:34.300 --> 11:36.358
<i>...campaign trail two years ago,</i>

11:36.468 --> 11:40.029
We fell in love, and when I learned
that she was carrying our child,

11:40.139 --> 11:42.131
I planned to propose,

11:42.242 --> 11:45.405
so you can imagine my shock
and horror when I learned that

11:45.512 --> 11:49.243
the President of the United States
was abusing his power and privilege

11:49.482 --> 11:51.382
to take sexual advantage of Ms. Tanner.

11:51.851 --> 11:53.876
When I learned that she killed herself

11:53.987 --> 11:56.684
only weeks after sleeping
with the President,

11:56.790 --> 12:00.623
and when I found an explicit audiotape

12:00.727 --> 12:03.492
that Amanda had made

12:03.597 --> 12:07.192
of her sexual encounter
in the Oval Office

12:07.301 --> 12:09.166
with the President of the United States.

12:09.603 --> 12:11.366
<i>If you have any questions,
I'd be happy to take them,</i>

12:14.608 --> 12:15.836
<i>Have you spoken
to Ms, Tanner's family?</i>

12:16.310 --> 12:19.302
<i>I haven't, but, obviously,
my thoughts and prayers</i>

12:19.413 --> 12:20.573
<i>are with them and have been all along,</i>

12:20.681 --> 12:21.649
<i>Where did you find the tape?</i>

12:21.783 --> 12:22.771
<i>Please, guys, one at a time,</i>

12:22.883 --> 12:25.182
<i>Did Amanda Tanner
tell you she was seeing the President?</i>

12:25.287 --> 12:26.878
<i>She did,
She was very upset about it,</i>

12:27.188 --> 12:28.952
Red Team will take the lead.

12:29.057 --> 12:31.855
They will secure all of the children
in the compound first,

12:32.027 --> 12:34.518
prior to the arrival
of the Blue Team and intelligence...

12:34.629 --> 12:36.426
Now what's interesting is,

12:36.531 --> 12:38.897
Lincoln never actually slept
in the Lincoln Bedroom.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.400
<i>I don't think the President cares
to speak with me right now,</i>

12:41.503 --> 12:43.130
<i>but if he ever should,
the door is always open,</i>

12:43.238 --> 12:44.865
<i>How did you find
the President's sex tape?</i>

12:44.973 --> 12:46.736
<i>I discovered it
among Amanda's personal effects,</i>

12:46.841 --> 12:48.308
<i>So, Billy,
you've heard the tape yourself?</i>

12:48.410 --> 12:50.105
<i>Unfortunately, yes, Look,</i>

12:50.246 --> 12:52.839
when you hear the tape,
and I can promise that you will,

12:52.948 --> 12:55.974
I think you will all agree
that it is unmistakably President Grant.

12:56.084 --> 12:58.315
Do you feel the public has
a right to hear what's on that tape?

12:58.421 --> 12:59.911
You get him down.
I don't care how you do it.

13:00.022 --> 13:01.717
- Why is he still talking?
- All due respect, sir,

13:02.091 --> 13:03.285
we need to consider the optics here.

13:03.392 --> 13:05.087
- Oh, no. Go.
- Forcibly removing the Vice President's

13:05.194 --> 13:07.185
Chief of Staff from the press podium
is just gonna legitimize...

13:07.296 --> 13:08.957
- I want him down now.
- Now?

13:09.065 --> 13:10.032
- Now!
- Everyone, it looks like

13:10.132 --> 13:11.156
that's all the time I have.

13:14.270 --> 13:16.535
- It's been a morning.
- You're fired, Marvin.

13:18.608 --> 13:19.906
<i>And it was just minutes ago,</i>

13:20.010 --> 13:22.843
<i>former Vice President
Chief of Staff Billy Chambers</i>

13:22.946 --> 13:25.574
<i>leveled some truly shocking charges
against President Grant,</i>

13:25.716 --> 13:28.685
<i>The President of the United States
was abusing his power</i>

13:28.785 --> 13:30.548
<i>to take sexual advantage
of Ms, Tanner,</i>

13:32.656 --> 13:34.214
You are letting Billy Chambers
run roughshod

13:34.324 --> 13:36.155
over everything we've spent
the past 15 years working for!

13:36.260 --> 13:38.252
I am not!
I am trying to figure out what to do,

13:38.362 --> 13:39.386
- the best thing...
- Get out there

13:39.496 --> 13:40.622
and tell them you didn't do it!

13:40.999 --> 13:43.728
Right now. Walk outside.
Tell the press you never touched her,

13:43.834 --> 13:45.325
you don't even know
which girl they're talking about.

13:45.436 --> 13:46.493
That would be a lie.

13:47.205 --> 13:48.172
Then lie!

13:48.273 --> 13:49.569
- I can't.
- Why the hell not?

13:49.673 --> 13:50.936
Because I'm not you, Mellie.

13:51.743 --> 13:53.734
The American people
put their trust in me.

13:53.845 --> 13:56.506
I've already let them down.
I'm not willing to lie to them on top of it.

13:57.982 --> 13:58.971
Oh.

13:59.083 --> 14:02.712
You don't want to save yourself, fine.
You're on your own.

14:06.024 --> 14:07.321
It's about time they brought you in.

14:07.592 --> 14:10.118
- They need the big guns on this one.
- But I can't make any promises.

14:10.229 --> 14:13.392
Hey, in all my years here,
he's the only president

14:13.499 --> 14:16.832
who's made a point
to ask about my wife and kids.

14:16.935 --> 14:18.333
You do your best, Ms. Pope.

14:19.905 --> 14:20.997
- All right, guys. Let's go.
- Okay.

14:21.106 --> 14:22.835
- Let's go back and take it from the top.
- All right, Henry.

14:22.941 --> 14:24.306
- We're going live.
- Only deafening silence

14:24.410 --> 14:26.071
from the White House in response to
the allegations.

14:26.178 --> 14:28.943
Details are starting to emerge about
Amanda Tanner, the 27-year-old aide...

14:29.048 --> 14:31.380
Although the female voice on the tape
can't be determined at this time,

14:31.483 --> 14:32.745
we can clearly hear
the President saying the words,

14:32.851 --> 14:34.148
"Take off your clothes. "

14:46.399 --> 14:48.890
You know, in Vegas you can bet
on political candidates.

14:49.135 --> 14:50.500
Before I brought you on board,

14:50.604 --> 14:53.732
the odds on Grant for President
were listed at 70-to-1.

14:54.308 --> 14:55.274
You should have put money down.

14:57.478 --> 14:59.274
- You didn't.
- Won enough for a nice vacation

14:59.379 --> 15:00.677
I'll never take.

15:01.948 --> 15:04.349
Think we could do it again,

15:04.452 --> 15:06.214
the impossible?

15:09.255 --> 15:11.019
Or we go down trying.

15:17.932 --> 15:20.833
...and you will eat those words
for the rest of your days, Tom.

15:20.935 --> 15:23.495
I'm just asking you to keep
the damn caucuses at bay

15:23.604 --> 15:25.596
- until I get you talking points.
You should wait

15:25.707 --> 15:28.436
for the whole story. Do you want
to owe your readers an entire apology?

15:28.542 --> 15:30.238
- Everyone.
No, it happens.

15:30.345 --> 15:31.972
There are a lot of...
Everyone!

15:32.080 --> 15:33.172
Hold on.

15:33.315 --> 15:35.647
I need the room. Cyrus, Olivia, stay.

15:36.752 --> 15:37.810
I'm gonna need to call you back, Tom.

15:37.918 --> 15:40.353
But you are to make no decisions
without talking to me first. Clear?

15:40.455 --> 15:41.979
Got it. Thank you.

15:42.791 --> 15:44.190
Catch me up.

15:45.160 --> 15:47.185
Billy's making the rounds.
Networks are wall-to-wall with this.

15:47.295 --> 15:49.525
Majors broke into daytime
and trotted out the big guns.

15:49.631 --> 15:51.395
We need a statement
from you on camera,

15:51.534 --> 15:53.023
preferably with Mellie by your side.

15:53.168 --> 15:56.433
That ship's sailed. She's taking the kids
to Santa Barbara for a while.

15:56.738 --> 15:58.798
Fine. You alone from the Oval.
A flat denial.

15:58.908 --> 16:00.773
I'm not lying about this, Cy.

16:00.877 --> 16:02.572
Anyway, a cover-up's
always worse than the truth.

16:02.678 --> 16:03.736
Well, we don't have enough truth yet.

16:03.846 --> 16:06.246
There's more to this story.
I'm sending you to Georgia.

16:06.349 --> 16:08.510
Milk the end of the cult standoff.
It will buy us some time.

16:08.618 --> 16:11.416
- He'll look like he's running from this.
- He'll look presidential.

16:11.554 --> 16:13.022
We need you business as usual,

16:13.123 --> 16:14.851
focused on what's important
for the country.

16:14.957 --> 16:16.516
Wave as you walk out to Marine One.

16:16.960 --> 16:18.483
Remember, you're not dodging.
You're working.

16:18.895 --> 16:21.329
We'll let that image speak for us
until we figure out what Billy's up to.

16:21.531 --> 16:22.760
Yeah.

16:22.866 --> 16:24.891
I never thought it would be
one of our own trying to sink us.

16:29.006 --> 16:31.031
Look, I can speculate all day long

16:31.175 --> 16:33.200
as to why the most powerful man
in the world

16:33.310 --> 16:35.575
would want to throw it all away
for some tawdry affair,

16:35.879 --> 16:40.748
but I think we should let President Grant
speak for himself.

16:41.151 --> 16:43.483
Here it is, folks. Your President.

16:44.354 --> 16:45.447
<i>Take off your clothes,</i>

16:47.826 --> 16:48.884
Mr. President. Mr. President.

16:48.993 --> 16:50.721
Did you have sexual relations
with Amanda Tanner?

16:50.828 --> 16:52.023
Is Billy Chambers telling the truth?

16:53.097 --> 16:55.156
We've been focused
on protecting the innocent children

16:55.266 --> 16:56.893
caught in the middle
of this terrible ordeal.

16:57.101 --> 16:59.592
Thankfully, no lives were lost. Thanks.

17:00.104 --> 17:01.298
<i>Take off your clothes,</i>

17:02.407 --> 17:03.841
No president has done more

17:03.943 --> 17:06.035
to put women
at the forefront of his administration.

17:06.144 --> 17:07.612
Like hell you will, Senator.
- Your organization

17:07.713 --> 17:08.872
- endorsed him in the election.
Okay, fine.

17:08.980 --> 17:10.915
We can switch from frenemies
to enemies. I'm flexible.

17:11.016 --> 17:13.415
I'm easy, you stupid,
ungrateful son of a bitch.

17:15.854 --> 17:16.878
<i>Take off your clothes,</i>

17:21.527 --> 17:22.892
- How bad?
- Internal flash poll

17:22.994 --> 17:24.929
has us down 25 to 28 approval

17:25.030 --> 17:28.157
with 67% answering yes to the question
of whether the President should resign.

17:28.267 --> 17:29.963
- We gotta rein this in.
- There's only one person

17:30.070 --> 17:31.093
that may be capable of that right now.

17:31.203 --> 17:32.671
So you think Billy Chambers
is the problem,

17:32.772 --> 17:33.999
and I'm somehow the solution?

17:34.106 --> 17:35.802
Let's not be coy with one another, Sally.

17:35.909 --> 17:37.569
Billy's your boy.
Are you really saying you had...

17:37.676 --> 17:40.908
No idea. Absolutely not.
You saw me when I read that letter.

17:41.013 --> 17:43.107
I was as shocked as you were,
Mr. President.

17:43.216 --> 17:45.116
Now whatever ménage à trois
you and Billy Chambers

17:45.218 --> 17:46.708
have got going on
with that poor dead girl,

17:46.820 --> 17:49.983
I have nothing to do with
and I want nothing to do with.

17:50.090 --> 17:52.081
Now I offer to keep you both
in my prayers

17:52.192 --> 17:54.923
and remain a humble servant
to both God and my president,

17:55.029 --> 17:56.518
in that order.

18:02.336 --> 18:03.563
<i>Take off your clothes,</i>

18:06.240 --> 18:07.400
Finger Billy for Gideon's murder,

18:07.508 --> 18:09.373
his whole story unravels.
It all goes away.

18:09.477 --> 18:11.707
- You save the presidency.
- And get justice for Amanda Tanner.

18:11.812 --> 18:13.837
There's no security camera
in Gideon's building.

18:13.948 --> 18:15.381
I checked his neighbors,
the local shops.

18:15.483 --> 18:17.178
Nobody places Billy Chambers
at the scene.

18:17.285 --> 18:19.686
And all physical evidence of the crime
is gone, thanks to us.

18:21.822 --> 18:24.223
We should know
what we're doing this for,

18:24.326 --> 18:25.690
protecting no-name in there.

18:26.194 --> 18:28.127
Come on.
I know that she just lost her boyfriend,

18:28.229 --> 18:31.529
but the girl could be a serial killer,
and we're breaking the law for her.

18:31.633 --> 18:33.294
- We broke the law for her.
- Olivia hired her.

18:33.402 --> 18:35.768
Olivia knows who she is.
That makes her worth protecting.

18:36.939 --> 18:38.930
Hi, guys. What you doin'?

18:41.176 --> 18:43.667
You all look like you've got
your thinking caps on.

18:43.812 --> 18:45.940
Wouldn't be about that crime scene
you cleaned up, would it?

18:46.049 --> 18:47.743
You can't just barge in here
without a warrant.

18:47.849 --> 18:49.840
And you can't just steal evidence,
so let's just call it even.

18:49.952 --> 18:51.750
- What are you talking about?
- Where's Quinn Perkins?

18:53.388 --> 18:56.290
A neighbor saw her
going into Gideon Wallace's place

18:56.392 --> 18:57.449
the night he was killed.

18:57.559 --> 18:59.528
Is that why you cleaned up the scene?

18:59.796 --> 19:01.161
His personal items were all gone.

19:01.264 --> 19:03.289
A little odd to find a journalist
without a BlackBerry

19:03.399 --> 19:05.162
glued to his hand, even a dead one.

19:09.172 --> 19:10.332
Okay.

19:11.408 --> 19:13.603
I just need to make a quick...

19:17.948 --> 19:20.712
You need to turn off the ringer
when you steal a phone.

19:20.951 --> 19:22.975
Detective Marsh, find that phone.
Take it into evidence.

19:23.153 --> 19:25.053
- Okay.
- This is fun.

19:25.155 --> 19:26.679
What's Quinn's number?

19:27.725 --> 19:29.158
I'm right here.

19:33.631 --> 19:35.030
- Give Harrison a dollar.
- What?

19:35.132 --> 19:36.395
Just do it.

19:38.836 --> 19:40.701
He's now your lawyer.
You don't have to tell them anything.

19:40.804 --> 19:43.137
We do this in your office, not downtown.
No booking.

19:43.241 --> 19:44.605
Fine with me. Let's go.

19:45.510 --> 19:47.068
No fingerprints, right?

19:47.178 --> 19:48.736
No fingerprints.

20:07.566 --> 20:10.500
I'm surprised you made it
through all the press out there.

20:10.603 --> 20:14.972
I've lost count of how many interviews
I've given over the last few days.

20:16.741 --> 20:20.076
I know you didn't come in here
to use the men's room.

20:20.180 --> 20:22.147
You might as well say it.

20:22.581 --> 20:24.446
You're a murderer.

20:26.787 --> 20:29.550
I am not proud of that.

20:31.257 --> 20:34.625
Hell, I didn't think I'd get away with it.

20:34.728 --> 20:35.819
I didn't hear from the police,

20:35.929 --> 20:40.195
so I asked around and heard
that they didn't find a single fingerprint,

20:40.300 --> 20:41.597
not even the murder weapon.

20:41.702 --> 20:45.571
Some angel
cleaned up the crime scene.

20:46.473 --> 20:47.701
What the hell happened to you?

20:47.808 --> 20:50.777
Look, I know what I did, okay?

20:50.877 --> 20:52.869
I made a mistake.

20:52.979 --> 20:55.346
A big one,
and I'm gonna be judged for it,

20:55.450 --> 20:57.815
but he should be judged
for what he's done, too.

20:58.252 --> 21:00.219
He took advantage of that girl, of you.

21:00.320 --> 21:02.152
He took advantage
of the whole damn country.

21:02.256 --> 21:04.816
He betrayed the very people
who elected him.

21:04.926 --> 21:08.828
Good, honest, God-fearing people
elected that man to office,

21:08.930 --> 21:10.865
and he promised things to us!

21:14.169 --> 21:16.636
And he didn't deliver on any of it.

21:17.573 --> 21:19.039
I mean, come on, Liv.

21:19.140 --> 21:20.472
The whole country's going off the rails.

21:20.943 --> 21:23.137
I don't think that defense
is gonna work in court, Billy.

21:23.244 --> 21:28.308
By the time I'm in jail,
Sally Langston will be president,

21:28.751 --> 21:32.084
and she is going to be
the finest president

21:32.187 --> 21:35.816
this country has ever known,
and that's all that matters.

21:38.460 --> 21:40.826
I got Chris Matthews waiting.

21:44.066 --> 21:46.331
Why don't you start by telling me
how you know Gideon Wallace?

21:46.436 --> 21:47.925
- You don't have to answer that.
- All right.

21:48.036 --> 21:49.561
Why were you
at Gideon Wallace's apartment?

21:49.672 --> 21:52.698
- You don't have to answer that.
- Okay, fine. We'll start with the basics.

21:52.809 --> 21:54.174
Quinn, state your name for the record.

21:54.277 --> 21:56.370
You don't have to answer that.

21:56.479 --> 21:59.073
Here I thought your boss
was the biggest pain in the ass in D.C.

21:59.182 --> 22:01.651
- Speak of the devil.
- David, new shirt? I like it.

22:01.751 --> 22:03.116
What the hell's going on, Liv?

22:03.219 --> 22:04.744
- You don't have to answer that.
- Yeah,

22:04.955 --> 22:06.387
I do.

22:09.859 --> 22:14.194
So, the Vice President's Chief of Staff
convinced Amanda Tanner

22:14.298 --> 22:16.458
to seduce
the President of the United States.

22:16.566 --> 22:17.864
- Yes.
- And then he abducted her

22:17.968 --> 22:19.526
from your apartment and killed her

22:19.637 --> 22:21.832
when she wouldn't go through
with the intense media scrutiny

22:21.939 --> 22:23.201
her accusations would bring,

22:23.307 --> 22:25.036
dumping her body in the river
for my people to find?

22:25.342 --> 22:27.276
Well, he contracted out,
but, yes, Billy had her killed.

22:27.378 --> 22:30.143
He then went on to murder a reporter

22:30.248 --> 22:32.681
who was presumably quite close
to figuring out what he was up to?

22:32.783 --> 22:34.683
- Yes.
- A reporter who was also sleeping

22:34.785 --> 22:37.846
with one of your employees,
whose presence at the crime scene

22:37.955 --> 22:40.151
your associates erased all evidence of,

22:40.258 --> 22:42.191
thereby rendering
the first-degree murder

22:42.293 --> 22:45.285
of an innocent 29-year-old man
all but unsolvable.

22:45.429 --> 22:46.397
Yes.

22:47.666 --> 22:50.157
Well, I did say I wanted to know.

22:50.268 --> 22:54.034
- David, I know this is crazy.
- I believe you, oddly enough.

22:54.172 --> 22:55.470
Then help me.

22:55.575 --> 22:57.542
Put on your white hat
and go after Billy Chambers

22:57.642 --> 22:59.577
with whatever you think
you can make stick.

22:59.678 --> 23:01.704
He's a murderer, so do some digging.

23:01.814 --> 23:03.179
Find some evidence.
Make some evidence.

23:03.348 --> 23:05.874
Give him a parking ticket.
Whatever it takes to get him down here.

23:05.985 --> 23:09.421
Get some justice for Amanda Tanner
and Gideon Wallace, please.

23:11.290 --> 23:13.258
- No.
- No?

23:13.392 --> 23:17.557
I am the law, the law is me,
and I might bend it from time to time,

23:17.698 --> 23:19.927
but I don't break it for you
or anyone else.

23:20.032 --> 23:21.556
- But you said you believed me.
- I do,

23:21.868 --> 23:23.768
and if you had left me
any evidence to build a case

23:23.871 --> 23:25.895
against Billy Chambers,
that's what I'd be doing,

23:26.172 --> 23:27.640
but you broke the law,

23:27.741 --> 23:30.072
so get out of my office
before I have you arrested

23:30.176 --> 23:31.667
for tampering with a crime scene.

23:31.812 --> 23:34.747
Quinn Perkins is a material witness
to a murder,

23:34.848 --> 23:38.409
and as such, she stays with me.
The law, Olivia.

23:43.924 --> 23:44.948
What do we do?

23:45.459 --> 23:46.620
What's next?

23:51.265 --> 23:53.757
I get up there
and say it's me on the tape.

23:53.868 --> 23:56.735
That's ridiculous.
What does that even do for us?

23:56.871 --> 23:59.362
He's not tied to a girl's suicide.
It's not perfect,

23:59.474 --> 24:01.338
but it takes care
of the impeachment problem.

24:01.441 --> 24:04.002
Wonderful, so now we've got
a slutty president problem?

24:04.112 --> 24:05.101
He slept with two women.

24:05.680 --> 24:06.806
I'm sorry. I just...

24:07.115 --> 24:08.639
Maybe there's another option
we're not seeing here.

24:08.750 --> 24:11.116
There is. I could resign.

24:12.086 --> 24:14.486
We all know how this goes.
The prosecutor is appointed.

24:14.590 --> 24:16.216
Every single person
in the West Wing is deposed.

24:16.324 --> 24:18.953
This thing is a circus that's gonna go on
for the next three years.

24:19.061 --> 24:20.584
I'll wear it around my neck
until the end of my term.

24:20.695 --> 24:23.493
My hands will be tied. I'll be lucky
if I can get a Parks and Rec bill passed.

24:24.099 --> 24:27.626
Let's put the country out of its misery,
end it now.

24:28.437 --> 24:29.495
And then what?

24:33.375 --> 24:35.138
We go be regular people, Cy.

24:35.244 --> 24:37.474
You can't be a regular person.

24:38.814 --> 24:40.715
We... We can't.

24:42.551 --> 24:44.611
We're not... I...

24:47.290 --> 24:49.052
I can't adopt a baby!

24:57.100 --> 24:58.533
I'm so sorry.

25:01.137 --> 25:02.366
I'm not.

25:04.341 --> 25:05.502
I'm not.

25:07.344 --> 25:09.939
A man who isn't president has options.

25:12.249 --> 25:14.740
A man who isn't president
can divorce his wife.

25:15.686 --> 25:17.176
- Fitz.
- A man who isn't president

25:17.287 --> 25:18.949
can have a life.

25:21.225 --> 25:22.852
The life he wants,

25:24.061 --> 25:26.256
the life he's always wanted.

25:28.499 --> 25:30.433
With the woman he loves.

25:34.940 --> 25:36.463
The cameras.

25:40.812 --> 25:42.245
I don't care.

26:25.192 --> 26:27.318
Of all the paintings in the White House,

26:27.427 --> 26:30.419
this one is my favorite.
Alexander Hamilton,

26:30.763 --> 26:33.164
as brilliant a political thinker
as any man or woman

26:33.267 --> 26:35.735
who has ever walked these halls,
but he wasn't the president.

26:36.270 --> 26:38.795
Washington was the president.
He was the winner.

26:39.039 --> 26:41.837
But Hamilton could pick a winner.

26:41.942 --> 26:43.638
He knew who the country needed
when they needed it.

26:45.779 --> 26:50.046
I don't doubt that he could do it,
live the normal life he's always wanted,

26:50.151 --> 26:54.144
walk the dog, mow the lawn,
a simple life, a happy life.

26:54.289 --> 26:56.382
For most people, that's fine.
It's all they need.

26:56.791 --> 26:58.554
For him, it's a waste.

26:58.659 --> 27:01.925
Of talent, of potential.

27:02.030 --> 27:05.762
That man was born to be a leader.
He was born to do this.

27:06.434 --> 27:08.869
Anything less would diminish him
and deprive this country.

27:10.038 --> 27:12.564
He can talk all he wants
about a regular life.

27:13.808 --> 27:15.709
Some men aren't meant to be happy.

27:17.846 --> 27:19.678
They're meant to be great.

27:33.562 --> 27:34.893
I got this.

27:50.547 --> 27:52.742
I've been screwing around on Georgia.

27:52.883 --> 27:54.976
I don't want to lie anymore.
I'm gonna tell her the truth,

27:55.085 --> 27:57.883
and then she'll break off
the engagement.

27:59.557 --> 28:02.389
I tried, Liv. I leapt.

28:04.027 --> 28:07.963
You said if I tried and failed,
it was not on me.

28:12.403 --> 28:13.427
You were wrong.

28:15.005 --> 28:16.871
I cheated. It is on me.

28:17.942 --> 28:19.705
And it's on you, too.

28:20.478 --> 28:22.036
It's always on you.

28:22.146 --> 28:25.344
You can't do this. You can't have him.

28:50.677 --> 28:52.405
Normal is overrated.

29:06.793 --> 29:08.590
Abby, Stephen,
dust off my campaign file

29:08.695 --> 29:10.219
for Sally Langston.
We need ammunition,

29:10.330 --> 29:13.094
big, small, anything you can find.
Dig deep and dig fast.

29:13.199 --> 29:15.360
Huck, I need the First Lady's schedule
for the next 12 hours.

29:15.468 --> 29:16.560
I'm gonna need to see her alone.

29:16.803 --> 29:18.134
Find me a window.

29:18.238 --> 29:19.365
Harrison, check back with Quinn.

29:19.906 --> 29:21.066
Make sure David's behaving himself.

29:22.243 --> 29:23.539
Liv.

29:24.978 --> 29:26.640
Billy Chambers. I can take care of that.

29:26.747 --> 29:29.944
- Take care of?
- Lf you want me to, it's no problem.

29:33.621 --> 29:37.216
Huck, I do not want you
to kill Billy Chambers.

29:37.458 --> 29:39.050
Okay, that's cool. Whatever.

29:39.660 --> 29:41.356
Promise me.

29:41.463 --> 29:42.929
I promise.

29:43.030 --> 29:47.263
Say, "I promise
not to kill Billy Chambers. "

29:47.369 --> 29:50.030
I promise not to kill Billy Chambers.

29:59.314 --> 30:00.440
I'm gonna need to talk to the nanny.

30:00.548 --> 30:02.812
She can fly the kids out once a month
until school is out in D.C.

30:02.917 --> 30:03.975
I also need you to call ahead

30:04.085 --> 30:06.611
and make sure both the main house
and the beach cottage are ready.

30:06.722 --> 30:08.552
I'll be spending at least
some of the weekends at the cottage.

30:08.657 --> 30:10.648
Ma'am, you have a visitor.

30:12.160 --> 30:13.458
Thank you.

30:19.735 --> 30:20.861
He's talking about resigning.

30:21.936 --> 30:23.165
You must love that.

30:23.272 --> 30:24.796
This isn't about me.

30:24.907 --> 30:27.137
Really? Seems like
my whole marriage is about you.

30:28.377 --> 30:30.402
Mellie, he can't resign.

30:30.513 --> 30:33.141
I'm sure
we can make some kind of deal.

30:37.019 --> 30:39.510
I try to be pleasant. I try to be.

30:42.059 --> 30:44.026
I'm the First Lady. There are sacrifices.

30:44.126 --> 30:47.391
There's a price,
and for a time, that was fine.

30:47.898 --> 30:50.799
You and I wanted the same thing.
Fitz in the Oval.

30:51.001 --> 30:53.299
We were on the same team, you and I,

30:53.403 --> 30:55.234
and everything was fine.

30:55.339 --> 30:58.103
I just don't understand what happened.

30:58.208 --> 30:59.232
What happened?

30:59.843 --> 31:02.778
You let that girl get into his pants!

31:04.482 --> 31:05.948
You left the team, Liv!

31:06.216 --> 31:09.583
You fell down on the job!
You broke his heart,

31:09.687 --> 31:11.746
and you left him open
and vulnerable and helpless,

31:11.856 --> 31:13.824
and that is how
that snake Billy Chambers

31:13.925 --> 31:16.450
got that shiny red Amanda apple
right into Fitz's hand.

31:17.962 --> 31:19.088
I do my job.

31:19.264 --> 31:22.358
I smile, and I push him

31:22.468 --> 31:24.731
and I make sure he has what he needs.

31:24.969 --> 31:27.938
I do my job.

31:29.508 --> 31:31.600
Why couldn't you do yours?

31:41.987 --> 31:43.545
You want to deal?

31:43.655 --> 31:45.680
Fine. Let's deal.

31:52.464 --> 31:53.897
For starters,

31:54.667 --> 31:56.327
I'm gonna need
to take my husband back,

31:57.771 --> 32:01.366
because clearly I have to do
everything myself from now on.

32:13.820 --> 32:16.118
I'm going to New Mexico.
I am, I promise.

32:16.257 --> 32:17.848
It's just my car's in the shop.
It's getting a tune-up.

32:17.957 --> 32:19.015
You can't go just yet.

32:19.125 --> 32:20.320
I gave you the girl. That was the deal.

32:20.428 --> 32:22.224
That wasn't a deal.
I tortured it out of you,

32:22.328 --> 32:24.422
but thank you. Very helpful.

32:24.731 --> 32:27.860
The guy who hired you, Billy Chambers,
he's talking an awful lot.

32:27.968 --> 32:29.401
Right now
it's just about the White House,

32:29.503 --> 32:31.300
but at some point,
he may talk about you.

32:31.405 --> 32:33.873
He can talk all he wants.
He didn't hire me for that job.

32:33.974 --> 32:35.532
You see, Charlie, you're honorable.

32:35.676 --> 32:39.407
You would never give up Billy,
but Billy may not be as honorable.

32:41.449 --> 32:44.543
- Why don't you do it?
- I can't. I gave my word.

32:47.354 --> 32:49.550
And we're gonna need a suicide note,

32:49.658 --> 32:52.286
something sad that says he's a liar.

32:52.394 --> 32:53.553
And then you'll leave me alone?

32:53.828 --> 32:54.887
Yeah.

32:55.197 --> 32:59.224
On a personal note, I think it would be
a big boost for your confidence.

32:59.334 --> 33:01.461
I can tell that's taken a bit of a hit
since I last saw you.

33:08.877 --> 33:10.812
I'm not saying anything
without my lawyer present.

33:10.947 --> 33:12.880
You need his permission to eat?

33:12.981 --> 33:14.506
You must be hungry.

33:18.187 --> 33:19.210
Hot.

33:20.590 --> 33:22.148
Turns out I don't even need
to question you anymore.

33:22.258 --> 33:23.520
Olivia told me everything.

33:23.626 --> 33:26.151
Amanda, Billy Chambers,
the whole shebang.

33:26.996 --> 33:29.557
So, why am I still here?

33:29.899 --> 33:31.924
Because there's one thing
she didn't tell me.

33:32.168 --> 33:33.897
- Why?
- Why?

33:34.103 --> 33:36.868
Why you called Olivia
and not the police,

33:36.973 --> 33:38.942
why her people would
clean up a crime scene

33:39.109 --> 33:40.769
they obviously want to be investigated,

33:40.943 --> 33:42.935
why everyone, and I do mean everyone,

33:43.046 --> 33:45.105
seems to be so invested
in making sure Quinn Perkins

33:45.215 --> 33:47.240
has nothing to do with any of this?

33:47.651 --> 33:49.619
I need to know what's really going on,

33:49.887 --> 33:53.345
so you can tell me what would happen
if I sent you down to booking,

33:53.457 --> 33:57.918
or I can take the prints from this fork

33:58.062 --> 33:59.528
and we can just go ahead and find out.

34:00.330 --> 34:01.696
It's your choice.

34:07.972 --> 34:09.405
I thought you left for Santa Barbara.

34:09.540 --> 34:11.202
I was on my way,
but Olivia convinced me

34:11.309 --> 34:12.867
I was needed here.

34:12.976 --> 34:15.467
We've come up with what we feel
is a solid plan of counter-attack

34:15.580 --> 34:19.380
in the media. And we also figured out
who the woman on the tape is.

34:21.853 --> 34:22.820
Oh?

34:23.589 --> 34:25.818
<i>It was me.
At least that's what we'll tell 20/20</i>

34:25.924 --> 34:27.983
when they arrive to interview us
in about...

34:28.092 --> 34:29.560
What time
did you set that up for again, Liv?

34:29.661 --> 34:31.925
- 5:30. We have about an hour.
- Mmm.

34:32.864 --> 34:34.456
And when I tell them
it was you and me on the tape,

34:34.567 --> 34:35.761
I will also share my outrage

34:35.868 --> 34:37.495
about the replaying
of our private moment

34:37.603 --> 34:39.969
in such a public, reckless
and irresponsible manner

34:40.072 --> 34:42.438
by the gossip-hungry,
left-leaning, mainstream media,

34:42.975 --> 34:44.601
and how upsetting it's been
for our family,

34:44.710 --> 34:47.577
especially at such a fragile time,
given that I'm newly pregnant.

34:48.949 --> 34:52.510
Liv suggested we remain vague
on the exact timing.

34:52.619 --> 34:53.676
It's none of their business.

34:53.786 --> 34:55.846
Plus, that gives us a few weeks' buffer
to actually get pregnant.

34:56.590 --> 34:58.615
We'll have to start trying right away,
of course.

34:59.926 --> 35:00.892
Of course.

35:02.829 --> 35:05.559
Well, Olivia can fill you in on the details.

35:05.765 --> 35:09.064
Like I always say,
if you've got a problem,

35:09.169 --> 35:10.535
get Olivia Pope on it.

35:13.808 --> 35:16.868
You could look a little happier, honey.
We did just save your presidency.

35:20.014 --> 35:22.607
Well, I'm off to hair and makeup.

35:26.252 --> 35:28.118
This is insane. We are not doing this.

35:28.222 --> 35:31.214
- It's the only way.
- What are you thinking?

35:31.325 --> 35:33.190
Who are you right now?

35:36.198 --> 35:38.392
The woman who got you elected,

35:39.401 --> 35:40.992
so go be the man I voted for.

35:52.080 --> 35:54.173
- You're all set, sir.
- Thanks.

35:56.485 --> 35:58.316
You can put this one
at the top of your résumé.

35:58.420 --> 35:59.409
Truly a masterpiece.

35:59.788 --> 36:01.416
The one interview that fixed it all.

36:01.524 --> 36:04.048
Not all of it is fixed.
There's still Billy Chambers' credibility,

36:04.159 --> 36:06.320
but this should take care of that.

36:06.428 --> 36:07.862
It's Cyrus-approved.

36:07.964 --> 36:10.431
We're ready for you, Mr. President.

36:14.904 --> 36:17.395
Lean forward
during the denials of the affair

36:17.540 --> 36:19.030
and keep your eyes on Mellie
when she's talking.

36:19.142 --> 36:21.610
I know how to fake it with my wife.

36:22.912 --> 36:24.607
You taught me well.

36:37.061 --> 36:38.186
<i>I was outraged,</i>

36:38.795 --> 36:40.388
<i>How could someone do that?</i>

36:40.497 --> 36:42.088
Ms. Pope, you did it again.

36:42.198 --> 36:43.598
The President has a great team.

36:43.734 --> 36:45.394
No. Don't give me that.

36:45.536 --> 36:47.731
Listen, I don't exactly know
what you do or how you do it,

36:47.838 --> 36:49.305
but when you walk through these gates,

36:49.473 --> 36:50.963
things start happening.

36:51.075 --> 36:54.567
The press starts falling in line,
the Secret Service gets extra secret,

36:54.712 --> 36:57.010
and the problems,
they just kind of disappear,

36:57.114 --> 37:00.914
and when you go back out,
everyone's breathing a little bit easier.

37:02.287 --> 37:03.311
Good night, Morris.

37:04.989 --> 37:06.047
<i>...for the whole country,</i>

37:06.458 --> 37:07.617
<i>The best thing for everyone</i>

37:07.726 --> 37:10.889
<i>would be if we can move
past this painful distraction</i>

37:10.995 --> 37:13.589
<i>and focus on the issues
that really matter,</i>

37:13.698 --> 37:15.325
<i>don't you agree?</i>

37:20.339 --> 37:21.431
I saw the interview.

37:21.539 --> 37:24.976
I thought that you and the First Lady
were very polished

37:25.077 --> 37:26.338
in the face of all that, very poised.

37:26.444 --> 37:29.709
Thanks for coming, Sally. Have a seat.

37:29.814 --> 37:32.045
I thought
she handled herself beautifully.

37:32.151 --> 37:36.178
Difficult situation for her,
I'm sure, having to listen to...

37:36.288 --> 37:38.688
Well, I can't even imagine.

37:41.193 --> 37:42.421
May I speak candidly, sir?

37:42.529 --> 37:45.497
- Why stop now?
- I don't think it's gonna be enough.

37:45.732 --> 37:47.665
I think it's wonderful
the First Lady is standing by you,

37:47.767 --> 37:50.032
but I don't think the American people
are gonna be so quick

37:50.137 --> 37:51.603
to follow in Mellie's lead.

37:51.704 --> 37:54.070
And that's exactly why I need you
to show them the way, Sally.

37:54.874 --> 37:55.842
- Sir?
- I want you to hold

37:55.942 --> 37:57.034
a press conference tomorrow.

37:57.177 --> 37:59.611
I want you to express your shock
and dismay

37:59.713 --> 38:01.304
over the actions of Billy Chambers.

38:01.447 --> 38:06.044
I want you to condemn his allegations
as baseless and false,

38:06.153 --> 38:08.951
and I want you to tell the nation
that you support your president.

38:10.190 --> 38:11.818
Well, now I'm just afraid
that dog won't hunt.

38:11.926 --> 38:13.688
We need to think
about what's best for the country,

38:13.794 --> 38:15.626
about the stability of our economy.

38:15.929 --> 38:19.161
We have a duty that goes
beyond our ideological differences.

38:19.267 --> 38:22.236
Focusing on my sex life
is bad for the nation,

38:22.336 --> 38:25.601
it's bad for the White House
and it's bad for you.

38:25.706 --> 38:27.970
Our first female president
ought to be elected

38:28.075 --> 38:29.042
by the will of the people,

38:29.143 --> 38:31.338
not by some ugly
backdoor political agenda.

38:31.445 --> 38:34.039
Mr. President,
I have based my whole career,

38:34.148 --> 38:37.175
my whole public life, on my values,

38:37.286 --> 38:39.880
strong, conservative, Christian values,

38:39.988 --> 38:42.649
and I know that might seem naive
to you and your Ivy League crowd.

38:42.758 --> 38:44.918
I know what you say about me
behind closed doors,

38:45.026 --> 38:46.255
but those are my beliefs.

38:46.361 --> 38:48.885
They are not accessories
I put on to win votes,

38:48.996 --> 38:52.990
so if you think you can treat me
like some religious lunatic sideshow act

38:53.101 --> 38:56.935
who will drop everything she believes
for political expediency,

38:57.072 --> 38:58.973
you have gravely misjudged me.

39:02.812 --> 39:04.278
You know what?

39:05.248 --> 39:06.737
I think I have.

39:13.656 --> 39:16.819
Now how old was your Cassidy
last spring, 14, 13?

39:16.926 --> 39:18.860
They grow up so fast.

39:18.962 --> 39:20.224
Anyway, we know she wasn't 18,

39:20.330 --> 39:22.298
because Georgia requires
parental notification

39:22.398 --> 39:24.798
for a minor to obtain an abortion.

39:25.702 --> 39:28.103
That must have been awful,
for you and Dan to get that call.

39:29.072 --> 39:31.541
It brings to mind the Gospel of John.

39:31.642 --> 39:35.702
Something about he who is without sin
casting the first rock

39:35.845 --> 39:37.837
or stone. I don't know.

39:39.148 --> 39:40.741
You know it better than I do.

39:42.685 --> 39:44.950
Thanks, Sally. That will be all.

39:46.891 --> 39:48.859
<i>It's sad, Matt,
You work with someone for years,</i>

39:49.026 --> 39:51.722
<i>you think you know
the kind of man they are,</i>

39:52.196 --> 39:55.461
<i>Billy Chambers
is just a huge disappointment,</i>

39:55.566 --> 39:57.830
<i>If I had any inkling
that the man that worked by my side</i>

39:57.935 --> 39:59.233
<i>for all these years...</i>

39:59.337 --> 40:03.535
<i>Well, God's honest truth, I would have
done everything in my power</i>

40:03.642 --> 40:05.132
<i>to send him away,</i>

40:05.243 --> 40:06.608
<i>to send him away from my house...</i>

40:06.711 --> 40:07.905
Where's all the press today, George?

40:08.013 --> 40:09.446
<i>- ... my precious family,
- Are they sleeping in?</i>

40:09.547 --> 40:12.277
<i>I just think
that the man is sick in the head,</i>

40:12.384 --> 40:14.945
<i>and I just pray that Billy gets
the help that he needs,</i>

40:15.054 --> 40:18.387
<i>because these malicious lies
he's been spreading,</i>

40:18.491 --> 40:19.923
<i>they're ridiculous,</i>

40:20.025 --> 40:22.153
<i>Well, I just thank God</i>

40:22.261 --> 40:25.355
<i>that we have a leader
like President Grant</i>

40:25.464 --> 40:28.399
<i>to take us through this difficult
and trying time,</i>

40:28.634 --> 40:32.468
<i>I believe that this country
was founded on truth and justice</i>

40:32.571 --> 40:34.436
<i>and plain old fairness,</i>

40:38.477 --> 40:40.275
Hold the elevator.

40:40.380 --> 40:41.971
There you go.

40:42.081 --> 40:44.345
- What floor?
- You first.

40:50.424 --> 40:52.254
Is there a war going on, Cy?

40:52.358 --> 40:54.725
There's always a war in the world,
James. You know that.

40:54.828 --> 40:56.557
Fine, but you said the latest one,
the bad one,

40:56.663 --> 40:58.654
the nuclear one,
the one that's taken you away

40:58.764 --> 41:01.393
every single weekend
for the past month, is over.

41:01.501 --> 41:03.264
It is. It's finally over.

41:03.370 --> 41:06.100
Then why is your work colleague
at our front door on Sunday morning?

41:07.708 --> 41:09.903
I will send him back here.

41:10.010 --> 41:11.204
I'll make it up to you. I promise.

41:11.311 --> 41:14.839
I want a baby,
a fat, drooling, smushy baby.

41:14.949 --> 41:16.348
Let's start with dinner and a movie.

41:16.451 --> 41:19.352
A baby, Cy. I mean it. A fat one!

41:25.493 --> 41:27.757
Sorry to bother you on a Sunday.

41:29.998 --> 41:30.966
Now, Charlie,

41:32.100 --> 41:34.228
I thought I was clear.
You know the rules.

41:34.370 --> 41:36.530
I do. I know. You have been very clear,

41:36.738 --> 41:38.206
and normally I wouldn't come
by the house like this.

41:38.307 --> 41:40.673
It's just I have to leave town,

41:41.310 --> 41:42.708
so you're gonna need to wire
the rest of the money

41:42.810 --> 41:44.472
for the girl, Amanda.

41:45.547 --> 41:47.742
Fine. You'll have it tomorrow.

41:48.317 --> 41:49.476
Thanks.

41:56.493 --> 41:57.686
I ran her prints.

41:58.060 --> 42:00.029
Don't worry.
I did it myself, which is a good thing,

42:00.130 --> 42:02.325
because otherwise there would be
about half a dozen U.S. Agencies

42:02.432 --> 42:04.296
looking for her.

42:04.400 --> 42:05.868
I'm breaking the law bringing her here.

42:06.603 --> 42:08.662
I don't break the law, Olivia.

42:16.579 --> 42:18.672
Do you want to tell them
who you are, or should I?
