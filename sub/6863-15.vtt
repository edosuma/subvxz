WEBVTT

00:01.402 --> 00:03.371
Fine as I can be,
I'm so sorry about Lavon
How are you?

00:03.437 --> 00:04.838
given that my heart is crushed

00:04.905 --> 00:06.540
and I'm probably gonna
die alone and whatnot.

00:06.607 --> 00:08.076
Meet me brothers,
Rudy, Rocket,

00:08.141 --> 00:09.443
and the scruffy
one's Chicken.

00:09.510 --> 00:11.879
I love my brothers,
but chaos follows them.

00:11.945 --> 00:14.248
ZOE: "We have your friend.
Ha-ha-ha, the Truitt brothers."

00:14.315 --> 00:17.285
You got my boyfriend kidnapped.
We're looking
at a top-to-bottom right here.

00:17.351 --> 00:19.353
Duke said that the remodel
is going to take two months!

00:19.420 --> 00:20.954
I'm not leaving just yet.

00:21.021 --> 00:24.225
Joel and I need to get his book
sold to Hollywood.

00:24.292 --> 00:26.227
Okay, truth--
I rejoined the Belles.

00:26.294 --> 00:28.296
I'm not dating just
Carter, I'm also dating
Grandma Bettie's chauffeur.

00:28.362 --> 00:30.030
I believe you have
two boyfriends.

00:30.098 --> 00:32.633
And it is amazing.

00:32.700 --> 00:36.170
Lemon, would you care to
tell us what's going on here?

00:36.237 --> 00:37.505
I've been seeing both of you.

00:37.571 --> 00:39.907
What are we gonna do?
 I mean,

00:39.973 --> 00:42.810
I can't choose just one of you.
ENRIQUE: You, LimÃ³n,
are worth it to fight.

00:42.876 --> 00:44.044
May the better man win.

00:47.148 --> 00:50.584
* *

00:50.651 --> 00:53.987
LEMON:
My life is all about
Carter and Enrique.

00:54.054 --> 00:55.856
Right now I have
no time to breathe.

00:55.923 --> 00:58.792
Until you start dating two guys,
your time-management skills

00:58.859 --> 01:00.261
haven't truly been tested.

01:00.328 --> 01:02.330
You should sew that on a pillow.
A.B., this is

01:02.396 --> 01:04.165
a big responsibility.

01:04.232 --> 01:06.234
This decision could impact
the rest of my life.
Is it possible

01:06.300 --> 01:08.469
you're putting
too much pressure on...

01:08.536 --> 01:09.670
Okay, I was born

01:09.737 --> 01:11.672
and bred to date
a Carter Covington, right?

01:11.739 --> 01:13.274
Okay.
But Enrique,

01:13.341 --> 01:14.875
I mean,
Enrique is...

01:14.942 --> 01:17.411
he's introducing me
to all new cultures,
to the arts,

01:17.478 --> 01:19.280
uh, words I don't understand

01:19.347 --> 01:20.981
and probably
never will.

01:21.048 --> 01:22.283
Okay, I get it.
I do.

01:22.350 --> 01:25.153
But... in the long run,
dating two guys

01:25.219 --> 01:27.020
is unsustainable.

01:27.087 --> 01:29.022
You need to have
an endgame. I mean,

01:29.089 --> 01:30.591
wh-what is the plan?

01:30.658 --> 01:33.026
Well, I mean, the plan
is to date... both of them

01:33.093 --> 01:35.396
until the universe nudges me
in the right direction.

01:35.463 --> 01:36.564
CARTER:
It should be illegal

01:36.630 --> 01:38.199
for two such
beautiful women

01:38.266 --> 01:40.033
to have breakfast
outside.
Oh...

01:40.100 --> 01:41.502
aren't you just full of charm.

01:41.569 --> 01:43.771
I was window-shopping,
and I saw an item

01:43.837 --> 01:45.173
that just spoke your name.

01:45.239 --> 01:47.175
Well, I hope it's not
a sidewalk painting,

01:47.241 --> 01:50.311
because she's
already got one! Ooh.

01:50.378 --> 01:51.912
(Lemon laughs)

01:51.979 --> 01:53.581
* *

01:56.317 --> 01:58.986
LEMON (gasps):
Oh, Carter!

01:59.052 --> 02:00.721
(laughs)

02:00.788 --> 02:02.456
SAL:
Anyone can buy love.

02:02.523 --> 02:05.459
Enrique here is making art
out of nothing.

02:05.526 --> 02:08.295
DELMA:
Don't hate 'cause he's
got money-- Carter here

02:08.362 --> 02:10.130
is a romantic.
SAL:
Carter's just a rich boy.

02:10.198 --> 02:12.600
It don't take no talent to pull
money out of your wallet.

02:12.666 --> 02:14.067
What do you know about talent?

02:14.134 --> 02:15.803
(neighs)

02:17.271 --> 02:18.672
Attention, people of BlueBell,

02:18.739 --> 02:20.474
Lavon Hayes has
an important announcement.

02:20.541 --> 02:23.677
ANNABETH:
Yeah, and that
is my cue to leave.

02:23.744 --> 02:25.613
LAVON:
Only two days left to get
your tickets to BlueBell's

02:25.679 --> 02:27.047
(horse huffs)
Renaissance Faire.

02:27.114 --> 02:28.682
Two days.
Again with

02:28.749 --> 02:30.584
the Renaissance Faire!
I thought he said

02:30.651 --> 02:32.186
it was something
important.
LAVON: Delma, I know

02:32.253 --> 02:33.487
you ain't bought
your tickets yet.

02:33.554 --> 02:36.023
Sal? Sal?
Renaissance Faire, come on, man!

02:36.089 --> 02:37.225
All-you-can-eat mutton.

02:37.291 --> 02:39.427
Renaissance fever-- catch it!

02:41.229 --> 02:42.496
JOEL:
I'm sorry.

02:42.563 --> 02:45.165
I just, I thought
you would be happy.

02:45.233 --> 02:47.100
(stammers)
How would this make me happy?!

02:47.167 --> 02:48.469
Well, because I, I got

02:48.536 --> 02:49.570
three plumbers
for the price of one.

02:49.637 --> 02:50.904
And plus their anecdotes are

02:50.971 --> 02:51.839
totally informing my new book.

02:51.905 --> 02:53.374
(cell phone ringing)

02:53.441 --> 02:55.309
Uh, hello?
Could you please focus on this?

02:55.376 --> 02:57.378
I'm sorry, Bets keeps
e-mailing me from L.A.

02:57.445 --> 02:59.513
It looks like your mom
really got the ball rolling.

02:59.580 --> 03:01.782
I got three studios bidding
on The Cicada's Lament.

03:01.849 --> 03:03.851
And she thinks
it's gonna sell today.

03:03.917 --> 03:05.586
Oh, that is great.

03:05.653 --> 03:07.988
But you know, honey,
just don't get your hopes up.

03:08.055 --> 03:09.390
Ah!

03:09.457 --> 03:10.558
I know, I know,
I know, you're right.

03:10.624 --> 03:11.492
But I just...

03:11.559 --> 03:12.893
I don't know I got,
I got to say

03:12.960 --> 03:14.295
even when I was writing it,
I really, I really

03:14.362 --> 03:15.863
thought that it could
be a movie.

03:15.929 --> 03:16.964
Well, yes, so could this.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.031
But they already made it

03:18.098 --> 03:19.800
with Larry, Moe and Curly.

03:19.867 --> 03:23.404
RUDY: Can you tell what
I had for breakfast?

03:23.471 --> 03:24.472
Sounded like pizza!

03:24.538 --> 03:25.706
That's it!
Is that it?

03:25.773 --> 03:27.107
I got it right?

03:27.174 --> 03:29.343
Why are you on a ladder?

03:29.410 --> 03:30.878
Why do you think?

03:30.944 --> 03:33.547
To get to the pipes for
the upstairs bathroom?

03:33.614 --> 03:35.416
Why don't you go upstairs

03:35.483 --> 03:38.085
to get to the upstairs bathroom?

03:38.151 --> 03:41.088
You can't go upstairs because
pipes are under the floor!

03:41.154 --> 03:42.823
Listen, lady, we
don't come down

03:42.890 --> 03:44.892
to your doctoring room
and tell you how to amputate.

03:44.958 --> 03:46.294
Good one!

03:46.360 --> 03:48.028
(yells)

03:48.095 --> 03:48.962
(shrieks)

03:49.029 --> 03:50.698
That's gonna hurt.

03:50.764 --> 03:51.665
(groans)

03:51.732 --> 03:54.402
We need to talk about tomorrow.

03:54.468 --> 03:56.570
Don't worry about a thing,
all right?

03:56.637 --> 03:59.340
I understand the importance
of a three month anniversary

03:59.407 --> 04:00.441
and as such,

04:00.508 --> 04:02.109
I have secured a yacht,

04:02.175 --> 04:03.444
and a captain,

04:03.511 --> 04:05.112
for a moonlight cruise

04:05.178 --> 04:06.714
of Mobile Bay.

04:06.780 --> 04:08.482
Okay, so that sounds
like the best possible

04:08.549 --> 04:10.884
three month anniversary ever.

04:10.951 --> 04:13.654
And I can't believe
I have to postpone.

04:13.721 --> 04:14.522
Seriously?

04:14.588 --> 04:15.523
Yeah, my entire roster

04:15.589 --> 04:16.656
of babysitters bailed.

04:16.724 --> 04:18.392
I don't know what the deal is.

04:18.459 --> 04:20.327
Look, I got two words for you.

04:20.394 --> 04:22.029
Rose Hattenbarger.

04:22.095 --> 04:23.664
Is that a made-up person?
No!

04:23.731 --> 04:26.867
No, she's like a certified,
professional, five-star

04:26.934 --> 04:28.369
babysitter.

04:28.436 --> 04:30.070
I know because she's been
leaving her flyer up

04:30.137 --> 04:31.405
on my bulletin board since
she was, like, ten years old.

04:31.472 --> 04:32.540
Go ahead, look.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.107
Okay.
I'm serious.

04:34.174 --> 04:35.476
All right.

04:35.543 --> 04:38.479
Listen, bucko,
your reign of terror--

04:38.546 --> 04:40.047
it ends now, okay?

04:40.113 --> 04:41.349
Tomorrow night you're gonna be
an absolute angel.

04:41.415 --> 04:42.816
You understand me?

04:42.883 --> 04:44.051
What if I'm not?

04:46.153 --> 04:47.621
All right, well,

04:47.688 --> 04:50.223
your pupils aren't dilated.

04:50.290 --> 04:51.992
No bruising.

04:52.059 --> 04:53.794
I want you to close your eyes
and tell me

04:53.861 --> 04:55.329
the months of the year
backwards-- start with December.

04:55.396 --> 04:58.332
R-E...

04:58.399 --> 05:00.167
December, November...

05:00.233 --> 05:02.736
He couldn't do that before
he fell off the ladder.

05:02.803 --> 05:04.772
Nobody can.
If that's the test

05:04.838 --> 05:08.108
for a concussion, I'm pretty
sure we've all got concussions.

05:08.175 --> 05:10.744
Does it start
with the letter "M"?

05:10.811 --> 05:12.446
Your brother's
gonna be just fine.

05:12.513 --> 05:13.447
Hey, you hear that, Chicken?

05:13.514 --> 05:14.848
You gonna live.

05:14.915 --> 05:16.517
Forever?

05:16.584 --> 05:18.352
Why don't you get some rest?

05:18.419 --> 05:19.787
And try to avoid any
additional trauma

05:19.853 --> 05:21.389
to the head
the next couple of days.

05:21.455 --> 05:22.723
Okay?
All right, you got it.

05:25.426 --> 05:26.360
Ow!
(shrieks)
Geez!

05:26.427 --> 05:27.395
Son of a biscuit!

05:27.461 --> 05:29.397
Joel!

05:29.463 --> 05:30.398
I'm just kidding!

05:30.464 --> 05:31.532
That was my hand!

05:31.599 --> 05:32.733
That was my hand.

05:32.800 --> 05:33.867
Oh!

05:33.934 --> 05:34.835
We'll see you later.

05:34.902 --> 05:37.170
Joelle!
Oh, God, thank you.

05:37.237 --> 05:39.106
Uh, Zo... Zoe?

05:39.172 --> 05:40.874
Um, so I just got
off the phone

05:40.941 --> 05:42.109
with Bets.

05:42.175 --> 05:43.544
It's done.

05:43.611 --> 05:46.079
Warner Bros. bought
my book for six figures!

05:46.146 --> 05:47.381
Get out of here!

05:47.448 --> 05:48.516
(laughing): I know!

05:48.582 --> 05:51.351
That's awesome! Holy crap!

05:51.419 --> 05:53.754
I heard you talking--
congratulations.

05:53.821 --> 05:57.290
Also, what time
y'all want us back?

05:57.357 --> 05:58.325
At your house?

05:58.392 --> 06:00.394
To finish plumbing?

06:00.461 --> 06:03.163
I think we're good for now.
We don't.

06:03.230 --> 06:04.565
LAVON:
 N-No, no, no!

06:04.632 --> 06:06.033
BlueBell loves town events.

06:06.099 --> 06:07.701
Yes, we do.

06:07.768 --> 06:09.202
But I think we're suffering
from festival fatigue here.

06:09.269 --> 06:11.572
I mean, besides Lemon's
multiple welcome home parties,

06:11.639 --> 06:14.442
we've had, let's see, Jazz Fest.

06:14.508 --> 06:16.176
We had Fusion Fest.

06:16.243 --> 06:17.310
We had Sandwich Fest.

06:17.377 --> 06:18.446
Uh, uh,

06:18.512 --> 06:19.647
Alabama's largest BLT.

06:19.713 --> 06:22.182
Pickle Fest.
Okay, fine, you...

06:22.249 --> 06:25.085
Maybe I've been feeling
an abundance of town spirit.

06:25.152 --> 06:28.321
Or a desire to distract yourself
from your breakup.

06:28.388 --> 06:30.223
Okay, okay, fine.

06:30.290 --> 06:32.760
You got to help me
with this Renaissance Faire.

06:32.826 --> 06:35.362
Look, I am on the hook
for costumes, animals,

06:35.429 --> 06:37.431
food, booze, musicians.

06:37.498 --> 06:39.266
Renaissance-style
Porta Pottis.

06:39.332 --> 06:40.734
All nonrefundable.

06:40.801 --> 06:42.302
Okay, you know what you need?

06:42.369 --> 06:44.638
You need a-a headliner.

06:44.705 --> 06:46.173
You need a big-ticket item.

06:46.239 --> 06:48.676
You know, like King Arthur
riding on a dragon.

06:48.742 --> 06:50.343
Or Van Halen
in Renaissance garb.

06:50.410 --> 06:51.745
You know?
You want to sell tickets?

06:51.812 --> 06:53.380
You give BlueBell
something to focus on

06:53.447 --> 06:56.750
other than deciding who's
the better boyfriend for Lemon.

06:59.152 --> 07:01.388
George, that's it.

07:01.455 --> 07:02.422
(taps desk, laughs)

07:02.490 --> 07:03.724
Yeah.

07:07.695 --> 07:09.497
Morning, A.B.

07:10.498 --> 07:11.932
You got a minute?

07:11.999 --> 07:13.501
Um... sure.

07:13.567 --> 07:14.768
What's up?

07:14.835 --> 07:16.436
Renaissance Faire
kicks off tomorrow.

07:16.504 --> 07:18.038
And, um,

07:18.105 --> 07:20.874
I'm-I'm having a little trouble
selling tickets.

07:20.941 --> 07:24.512
And I-I was wondering maybe
if, uh, you could do me a favor?

07:24.578 --> 07:26.814
Uh, what kind of a favor?

07:29.116 --> 07:31.051
Now, I'm still missing
the main event.

07:31.118 --> 07:33.521
Now, my idea is to have, uh,
Lemon's suitors,

07:33.587 --> 07:35.388
Enrique and-and Carter,

07:35.455 --> 07:37.257
stage a duel for her hand

07:37.324 --> 07:38.358
in front of the town.

07:38.425 --> 07:39.660
Like knights.

07:39.727 --> 07:42.195
I see.
And I-I was hoping

07:42.262 --> 07:44.331
maybe you could talk to her?

07:44.397 --> 07:45.999
Just to recap.

07:46.066 --> 07:48.035
After everything
we've been through,

07:48.101 --> 07:50.237
you want me to convince Lemon

07:50.303 --> 07:53.406
to have her
 two boyfriends compete

07:53.473 --> 07:55.743
for her affection
in a public arena

07:55.809 --> 07:58.946
to benefit your festival?

07:59.012 --> 08:01.582
Yeah, I'll get right on that.
Uh-huh.

08:04.217 --> 08:05.786
(Zoe shrieks)
Oh!

08:05.853 --> 08:08.488
Ha! To The Cicada's Lament...

08:08.556 --> 08:10.257
the movie.
Yeah, I got to tell you.

08:10.323 --> 08:11.759
It is mind-blowing.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.561
But the whole time I was
writing, I-I-I kept thinking

08:13.627 --> 08:16.229
of Ben Stiller or
John Cusack as Chuck.

08:16.296 --> 08:17.665
(gasps)

08:17.731 --> 08:18.899
What about Channing Tatum?

08:18.966 --> 08:19.700
Eh.

08:19.767 --> 08:20.701
But I mean, you know,

08:20.768 --> 08:22.302
Channing Tatum might do it.

08:22.369 --> 08:24.738
And I can hang out with him,
meet him and stuff, you know?

08:24.805 --> 08:27.174
Zoe?
What? I'm a little obsessed
with Channing Tatum.

08:27.240 --> 08:28.441
(knocking)
(laughs)

08:28.508 --> 08:29.643
Oh.

08:31.444 --> 08:32.679
Joel Stephens and Zoe Hart?

08:32.746 --> 08:35.248
Uh, present and accounted for.

08:35.315 --> 08:37.650
You are being sued by one
Lawrence Chicken Truitt

08:37.717 --> 08:40.721
for negligence leading
to pain and suffering.

08:40.788 --> 08:42.522
I'm sorry, what?
Come again?

08:42.590 --> 08:43.924
You've been served.

08:46.660 --> 08:49.162
(car horn honks)

08:49.229 --> 08:51.264
(seagulls calling)

08:51.331 --> 08:53.567
(birds singing)

09:01.141 --> 09:02.943
I can't believe the Truitt
brothers are suing us!

09:03.010 --> 09:04.211
After everything I did for them.

09:04.277 --> 09:05.378
Yeah, hiring them

09:05.445 --> 09:07.114
for a job they're
unqualified for.

09:07.180 --> 09:09.016
And then not firing them when
your girlfriend told you to.

09:09.082 --> 09:11.484
I am serious,
they could clean us out, Zoe.

09:11.551 --> 09:12.720
Listen, this lawsuit?

09:12.786 --> 09:13.887
It-it's a load of crap.

09:13.954 --> 09:15.255
George'll get it thrown out.

09:15.322 --> 09:17.224
George Tucker?
He's gonna be our lawyer?

09:17.290 --> 09:18.225
Mm-hmm.

09:18.291 --> 09:19.927
Why?

09:19.993 --> 09:21.895
Well, George is... He's great.
But don't you think there's just

09:21.962 --> 09:25.599
a teensy chance he's not at
the top of his game right now?

09:25.666 --> 09:26.867
He just broke up with Tansy.

09:26.934 --> 09:28.168
And what happened last time

09:28.235 --> 09:29.870
George went through
a romantic debacle?

09:29.937 --> 09:31.238
Nothing.
You said he barricaded

09:31.304 --> 09:33.741
himself in a cheap motel,
stopped speaking,

09:33.807 --> 09:36.009
stopped shaving,
ate pizza and watched

09:36.076 --> 09:38.378
Don Todd's Golf Safari
24 hours a day.

09:38.445 --> 09:39.880
Yeah, right. He did that.

09:39.947 --> 09:43.150
Look, I... You know, maybe...

09:43.216 --> 09:45.653
maybe I can talk
to the Truitts myself

09:45.719 --> 09:47.220
without any lawyers.

09:47.287 --> 09:48.856
You know, we're kind of pals.
Maybe see if we can settle

09:48.922 --> 09:50.323
this whole thing
with a conversation.

09:50.390 --> 09:52.259
No, no, you will not talk
to the Truitts.

09:52.325 --> 09:54.628
That's how we got into this
whole mess to begin with.

09:54.695 --> 09:56.163
George will make

09:56.229 --> 09:58.131
this whole thing go away,
trust me.

09:58.198 --> 09:59.432
Okay.

09:59.499 --> 10:00.734
Sure.

10:00.801 --> 10:01.969
What do you mean you're passing?

10:02.035 --> 10:04.337
I'm offering you
a paid gig here.

10:04.404 --> 10:06.539
I went on the babysitting blogs,
and I read all about this kid.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.041
The babysitting blogs?

10:08.108 --> 10:09.810
Yeah, there's blogs
for everything.

10:09.877 --> 10:11.411
One of the commenters said
that Harley gave her

10:11.478 --> 10:13.380
the choice between being
locked in the bathroom

10:13.446 --> 10:14.614
or locked in the basement.

10:14.682 --> 10:15.749
I remember.

10:15.816 --> 10:17.084
She chose bathroom at least.

10:17.150 --> 10:17.985
Smart choice.

10:18.051 --> 10:19.186
Why would I want to do this?

10:19.252 --> 10:20.520
Three reasons, all right?

10:20.587 --> 10:21.789
One, you are
a superior babysitter.

10:21.855 --> 10:23.190
Two, you like a challenge.

10:23.256 --> 10:25.525
And three,
you're my only option,

10:25.592 --> 10:26.994
so I'll pay you
through the nose.

10:31.198 --> 10:32.165
Oh, hey, Joel.

10:32.232 --> 10:33.701
Why is he wearing
a neck brace?

10:33.767 --> 10:35.669
Can't hold his head
up without it.

10:35.736 --> 10:38.405
Doctor said it might
just fall off.
Mm.

10:38.471 --> 10:39.673
And which doctor was that?

10:39.740 --> 10:41.374
That's...
confidential.

10:41.441 --> 10:43.677
What do you want, Joelle?

10:43.744 --> 10:45.913
Well, guys, you know... (laughs)

10:45.979 --> 10:47.480
I was just hoping
that we could...

10:47.547 --> 10:49.149
we could settle this ourselves.

10:49.216 --> 10:51.084
You know, because we've been
friends a long time.

10:51.151 --> 10:52.686
Since you guys kidnapped me.

10:52.753 --> 10:54.454
Right?
I still have
that picture of us.

10:54.521 --> 10:57.090
Right, and as friends, you know,
I just hope that we could agree

10:57.157 --> 10:59.993
that this lawsuit
is-is a little...

11:00.060 --> 11:01.862
It's a... it's a little silly.

11:01.929 --> 11:04.531
(laughs) You know, I mean,
it's-it's clear that Chicken

11:04.597 --> 11:06.133
didn't actually hurt himself.

11:06.199 --> 11:08.601
And the only reason
you are suing me is because

11:08.668 --> 11:10.203
you heard that my book sold.

11:10.270 --> 11:11.304
That is outrageous.

11:11.371 --> 11:13.606
I've never been more
offended in my life.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.275
Really? Never?

11:15.342 --> 11:17.210
All right, you know what.
Let me ask you this.

11:17.277 --> 11:20.147
How did you arrive
at this number?

11:20.213 --> 11:22.249
Because, I mean,
six figures is...

11:22.315 --> 11:24.017
(whistles)
I mean, it's a lot.

11:24.084 --> 11:25.485
Because of pain
and suffering.

11:25.552 --> 11:26.954
But mostly, lost earnings.

11:27.020 --> 11:28.255
I'm sorry. Lost earnings?

11:28.321 --> 11:30.323
That's right.
Chicken's always coming up

11:30.390 --> 11:31.491
with brilliant ideas.

11:31.558 --> 11:33.526
Prescription windshields-- his.

11:33.593 --> 11:36.563
Mayonnaise that never
expires-- his.

11:36.629 --> 11:37.765
We and our lawyer believe

11:37.831 --> 11:39.099
he was one
brainstorm away

11:39.166 --> 11:41.668
from a genius,
million-dollar idea

11:41.735 --> 11:43.470
when he tragically fell
off a ladder

11:43.536 --> 11:44.637
at your negligent house.

11:44.704 --> 11:45.839
Now, he'll never

11:45.906 --> 11:46.907
have that idea.

11:46.974 --> 11:48.308
Okay, that's insane.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.643
Um, Chicken,
let me ask you this.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.179
What is the bottom line for you?

11:52.245 --> 11:54.014
What is it gonna take
to make this go away?

11:54.081 --> 11:56.183
Don't talk to him.
I don't know. 50 bucks?

11:56.249 --> 11:57.951
50 bucks. Good.
No, he didn't mean that.

11:58.018 --> 12:00.187
And a date with that pretty
receptionist, Annabelle.

12:00.253 --> 12:01.121
AnnaBeth.

12:01.188 --> 12:02.655
AnnaBeth. Yes, that's the one.

12:02.722 --> 12:04.724
50 bucks, and a date
with AnnaBeth.

12:04.792 --> 12:06.526
Okay.
Rocket,

12:06.593 --> 12:08.328
give him the
mouth hand.

12:08.395 --> 12:10.463
That... that is just
the brain damage talking.

12:10.530 --> 12:13.366
All right, the price
is six figures, nothing less.

12:13.433 --> 12:14.902
Now, get out of here

12:14.968 --> 12:17.070
before we give
you a concussion.

12:19.472 --> 12:20.507
Bye, Joel.

12:20.573 --> 12:22.209
Picture it, Lemon.

12:22.275 --> 12:27.047
Your two suitors battling it out
for the queen's hand. Chills.

12:27.114 --> 12:30.050
Well, I like the part
about me being queen.

12:30.117 --> 12:31.919
But the rest
of it-- no.
Well,

12:31.985 --> 12:33.553
it'll help you choose.

12:33.620 --> 12:36.223
I mean, the winner will escort
you to the Renaissance Party

12:36.289 --> 12:37.825
and have exclusive
dating rights.

12:37.891 --> 12:39.559
'Cause that's how it
worked back then.

12:39.626 --> 12:41.194
I think.

12:41.261 --> 12:42.762
It is silly and undignified.

12:42.830 --> 12:44.064
Now, if you'll excuse me,

12:44.131 --> 12:45.465
I have outfits
to test drive,

12:45.532 --> 12:47.167
and I need to hydrate
and carbo boost, because

12:47.234 --> 12:49.402
I have multiple dates
to prepare for.

12:49.469 --> 12:51.504
(sighs)

12:52.639 --> 12:54.774
Okay.

12:56.243 --> 12:58.045
Hmm.

12:58.111 --> 12:59.847
Huh.

12:59.913 --> 13:01.714
You can share with me.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.450
Oh, uh,

13:03.516 --> 13:05.318
I mean, you-you have
a great smile,

13:05.385 --> 13:07.220
and I'm... I'm sure
you're all types of awesome,

13:07.287 --> 13:10.257
but I'm not really
looking for any

13:10.323 --> 13:12.525
romantic entanglements
right now, so...

13:12.592 --> 13:16.363
Wow. I was really just offering
for you to share my table,

13:16.429 --> 13:17.664
not my life.

13:17.730 --> 13:19.599
ZOE:
Hey,

13:19.666 --> 13:21.468
George, over here.

13:21.534 --> 13:24.137
Um... I... uh...

13:26.273 --> 13:28.075
Hi.

13:28.141 --> 13:30.410
Hi. Thank you for meeting
me on such short notice.

13:30.477 --> 13:32.545
Did you get a copy
of the lawsuit?

13:32.612 --> 13:34.181
Yes. It's a nuisance suit.

13:34.247 --> 13:35.883
I can get it tossed
in, like, ten seconds.
That's what

13:35.949 --> 13:38.118
I keep telling Joel.
Yeah, tell him not to worry

13:38.185 --> 13:40.220
at all. I mean, it's the Truitt
brothers, for God sake.

13:40.287 --> 13:41.554
I don't know
who's representing them,

13:41.621 --> 13:43.056
but all I have to do is show up

13:43.123 --> 13:44.557
wearing pants in court,
and we win.

13:44.624 --> 13:47.560
(laughs)
Sorry. I couldn't
help but overhear.

13:47.627 --> 13:48.728
You're George Tucker?

13:48.795 --> 13:50.030
I... (laughs)

13:50.097 --> 13:51.764
I didn't realize
when we had met earlier.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.166
I'm Connie Vincent,

13:53.233 --> 13:54.902
Chicken Truitt's attorney,

13:54.968 --> 13:57.037
and I have to say,
I did not expect

13:57.104 --> 14:00.908
opposing counsel to be
so presumptuous and insulting.

14:02.209 --> 14:03.843
Uh, George, there
were insults?

14:03.911 --> 14:05.245
No.

14:05.312 --> 14:06.846
I look forward to seeing you
in court tomorrow

14:06.914 --> 14:08.982
and teaching you a thing
or two about humility.

14:09.049 --> 14:11.184
Try not to forget
your pants.

14:16.256 --> 14:18.391
Don't worry.
I'll-I'll fix this.

14:18.458 --> 14:20.360
Well, you better.

14:20.427 --> 14:21.995
(birds singing)

14:22.062 --> 14:23.530
To another perfect
day in BlueBell.

14:23.596 --> 14:24.664
With the most perfect

14:24.731 --> 14:25.665
woman in town.

14:25.732 --> 14:26.633
(giggles)

14:26.699 --> 14:27.800
The most perfect creature

14:27.867 --> 14:29.269
in the universe.

14:29.336 --> 14:30.003
Oh.

14:30.070 --> 14:31.404
In the galaxy...

14:31.471 --> 14:33.306
which is actually bigger
than the universe.

14:33.373 --> 14:34.874
Oh.
ENRIQUE:
He said that?

14:34.942 --> 14:37.110
I'm not sure that's true.

14:37.177 --> 14:39.579
The pan-seared tuna
with a hint of rosemary,

14:39.646 --> 14:40.914
a whiff a cumin.

14:40.981 --> 14:42.149
(giggles)

14:42.215 --> 14:43.616
ENRIQUE:
 Espinaca con garbanzos.

14:43.683 --> 14:46.086
Oh, tortilla de patatas.

14:46.153 --> 14:48.888
Oh, come on. Now you're just
making Spanish words up.

14:48.956 --> 14:50.657
(giggles)

14:50.723 --> 14:52.359
(whispers):
Order more.
CARTER:
So I had a thought.

14:52.425 --> 14:54.127
How about you and I spend
the summer

14:54.194 --> 14:55.996
in my family's beach home
in Dauphin Island?

14:56.063 --> 14:57.764
That would be perfect.
ENRIQUE:
 SÃ­.

14:57.830 --> 15:01.101
I take you to Majorca,
we watch the wild horses run.

15:01.168 --> 15:03.971
You feel their power
in your very soul.

15:04.037 --> 15:05.605
We sleep under the stars.

15:05.672 --> 15:07.240
Oh.

15:07.307 --> 15:09.842
Well, I mean, that would be...
that would be perfect.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.444
Another drink?

15:11.511 --> 15:12.912
Why not? (laughs)

15:12.980 --> 15:14.714
Aperitif?

15:14.781 --> 15:16.849
Oh. Mais oui.

15:16.916 --> 15:18.851
Night cap?

15:18.918 --> 15:20.520
Down the hatch.

15:21.921 --> 15:24.024
Mm.

15:24.091 --> 15:27.627
Well, thank you

15:27.694 --> 15:29.963
for dinner, Enrique.

15:30.030 --> 15:31.598
It's Carter.

15:31.664 --> 15:33.666
Oh. (laughs)

15:35.868 --> 15:38.005
I had a lovely time, Carter.

15:38.071 --> 15:39.906
Mi nombre es Enrique.
Yes.

15:39.973 --> 15:42.709
Sweet dreams to you, too.

15:46.446 --> 15:48.448
(sighs, thudding)

15:55.455 --> 15:57.957
Well, the good news is,
you are not pregnant.

15:58.025 --> 15:59.292
Well, of course I'm not.

15:59.359 --> 16:01.794
Prenatal fainting is not
a Breeland trait.

16:01.861 --> 16:04.431
Your blood test looks good,
mono-spot's negative.

16:04.497 --> 16:07.000
My best guess would
be you're exhausted.

16:07.067 --> 16:09.269
(laughs)
I'm fine.

16:09.336 --> 16:10.603
Lemon, you fainted.

16:10.670 --> 16:12.405
That is a wake-up
call from your body.

16:12.472 --> 16:13.906
Step off the social
merry-go-round.

16:13.973 --> 16:15.042
Go on a boy cleanse.

16:15.108 --> 16:17.044
You go on a boy cleanse.

16:17.110 --> 16:21.014
Sorry. That was both
uncalled-for and too easy.

16:21.081 --> 16:23.650
It's just... are there
any other alternatives?

16:23.716 --> 16:27.020
Yes. Buy a helmet and keep
fainting all over town.

16:27.087 --> 16:29.189
Hmm.

16:29.256 --> 16:30.690
LEMON:
 Well, it seems like

16:30.757 --> 16:33.260
the medical establishment
agrees with you.

16:33.326 --> 16:34.694
I do not have
what it takes

16:34.761 --> 16:36.529
to date two
people at once.
Sweetie,

16:36.596 --> 16:38.631
you're, like, on an episode of
 The Bachelorette.

16:38.698 --> 16:40.033
That never, ever ends.

16:40.100 --> 16:41.634
Okay, I have
to make a choice.

16:41.701 --> 16:43.036
So I've made
two lists:

16:43.103 --> 16:44.571
reasons to
date Carter,

16:44.637 --> 16:46.139
and reasons to
date Enrique.

16:46.206 --> 16:47.507
Excellent!
And...?

16:47.574 --> 16:48.875
It's a tie.

16:48.941 --> 16:50.643
256 reasons each.

16:50.710 --> 16:52.345
Lemon...

16:52.412 --> 16:54.247
Listen, I just don't want to
make the wrong choice, AnnaBeth.

16:54.314 --> 16:56.049
I have done that
too many times before.

16:56.116 --> 16:57.584
I just...

16:57.650 --> 17:00.653
I want the universe
to decide this one for me.

17:01.954 --> 17:04.090
Well, we're just
gonna have to...

17:04.156 --> 17:06.393
goose the universe
a little bit.

17:06.459 --> 17:08.795
Take Lavon up
on his offer.

17:08.861 --> 17:10.130
Let your two
boyfriends duel.

17:10.196 --> 17:12.199
You date the winner.

17:16.269 --> 17:17.970
(goat bleats)

17:18.037 --> 17:20.073
How much are you
getting paid to babysit me?

17:20.140 --> 17:21.574
Who says I'm getting paid?

17:21.641 --> 17:23.675
Maybe I'm just doing it
for the love of the job.

17:23.742 --> 17:24.977
(lamb bleats)

17:25.044 --> 17:26.979
They're paying
me a lot.

17:27.046 --> 17:28.781
(cattle bellowing)

17:28.848 --> 17:30.783
(bellows)

17:32.919 --> 17:34.654
Take a picture,
it'll last longer.

17:36.356 --> 17:37.924
Hey, hey, uh,
I don't suppose

17:37.990 --> 17:39.058
your animals
do any tricks?

17:39.126 --> 17:40.360
What's that?

17:40.427 --> 17:41.628
I mean, you wouldn't
happen to have,

17:41.694 --> 17:43.130
you know, a horse
that counts

17:43.196 --> 17:45.232
or a sheep
that juggles?

17:45.298 --> 17:46.966
I mean, anything
to sell tickets.

17:47.033 --> 17:48.935
Juggling
sheep, huh?

17:49.001 --> 17:50.270
See that little goat over there?

17:50.337 --> 17:51.371
(goat bleats)

17:51.438 --> 17:52.972
He does a pretty
neat trick.

17:53.039 --> 17:54.841
Week from Tuesday,

17:54.907 --> 17:56.376
he's gonna turn into stew

17:56.443 --> 17:58.745
(laughing):
and a half-dozen filets.

17:58.811 --> 18:00.747
(laughing)

18:01.614 --> 18:03.983
(goat bleats)

18:04.050 --> 18:06.186
Goat stew?

18:08.421 --> 18:09.289
(bleats)

18:09.356 --> 18:10.690
(phone ringing)

18:10.757 --> 18:11.891
Lemon?

18:11.958 --> 18:13.160
Okay, Lavon.
(sighs)

18:13.226 --> 18:14.561
Let's do it.

18:14.627 --> 18:16.596
Carter and Enrique
can fight tomorrow.

18:16.663 --> 18:18.665
Winner gets me.

18:18.731 --> 18:20.967
Oh, oh, oh, thank you, Lemon.
(laughs)

18:21.033 --> 18:22.034
You're saving my festival!

18:22.101 --> 18:24.237
(laughs)
Bye.

18:24.304 --> 18:25.405
Wake up, Duane.

18:25.472 --> 18:27.006
We got tickets
to sell, man!

18:27.073 --> 18:28.208
(laughs)

18:33.112 --> 18:34.947
Oh!

18:35.014 --> 18:36.082
Hey.

18:36.149 --> 18:37.417
Uh, thanks for
meeting me here.

18:37.484 --> 18:39.252
Oh, no, thank you
for allowing me

18:39.319 --> 18:41.621
the opportunity to remove
my foot from my mouth.

18:41.688 --> 18:43.022
(both chuckling)

18:43.089 --> 18:45.192
Well, I'm glad
that you called.

18:45.258 --> 18:47.294
You know, I figure
we both want a fair trial.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.429
Might as well do it over
some drinks and music.

18:49.496 --> 18:50.997
Plus, I was here the other night

18:51.063 --> 18:53.032
and you are gonna
love this act.

18:53.099 --> 18:54.267
Oh. Great.

18:54.334 --> 18:55.702
Great. And then
afterwards,

18:55.768 --> 18:57.170
you and I can talk
about how your lawsuit

18:57.237 --> 18:58.471
doesn't really
stand a chance.

18:58.538 --> 19:00.473
Ooh, someone's
feeling confident.

19:00.540 --> 19:02.108
A little.
ANNOUNCER:
Ladies and gentlemen,

19:02.175 --> 19:03.410
please welcome to the stage
Here we go, show's starting.

19:03.476 --> 19:05.912
Miss Lily Anne Lonergan.

19:05.978 --> 19:07.947
(applause)

19:08.014 --> 19:09.182
It's Lily Anne
Lonergan.

19:09.249 --> 19:10.983
I... I'm friends
with her.

19:11.050 --> 19:12.652
Actually, I...
I sang with her.

19:12.719 --> 19:13.986
Huh.
Yeah.

19:14.053 --> 19:15.288
You don't say.
LILY ANNE:
Thank you, BlueBell.

19:15.355 --> 19:16.155
Those of you here last night

19:16.223 --> 19:18.157
heard my new set,

19:18.225 --> 19:20.059
inspired by summer on the road

19:20.126 --> 19:21.461
touring with a guy
from around here.

19:21.528 --> 19:22.929
I think she's
talking about me.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.431
(laughs)

19:24.497 --> 19:25.932
A down-and-out lawyer
turned country crooner

19:25.998 --> 19:28.801
who is maybe the saddest,

19:28.868 --> 19:30.937
most unfortunate soul

19:31.003 --> 19:33.206
I have ever met.
(audience laughs)

19:33.273 --> 19:35.808
This first song's called
"Unlucky Tucky."

19:35.875 --> 19:37.210
Huh!
I think

19:37.277 --> 19:39.579
it is you.

19:39.646 --> 19:41.448
* You're sad and you're lonely *

19:41.514 --> 19:44.317
* In your law-talking shoes *

19:44.384 --> 19:47.620
* No job and no sweetheart *

19:47.687 --> 19:50.823
* 'Cause all you do is lose *

19:50.890 --> 19:52.725
* Unlucky Tucky *

19:52.792 --> 19:55.228
* Why do you feel so blue? *

19:55.295 --> 19:57.764
* Are you tired of being you? *

19:57.830 --> 19:59.666
* You keep takin' it
on the chin... *

19:59.732 --> 20:00.967
So...
Mmm?

20:01.033 --> 20:03.069
...just so I have this straight,

20:03.135 --> 20:05.338
you heard this
last night

20:05.405 --> 20:07.974
and you thought
I might enjoy it?

20:08.040 --> 20:09.842
Will it throw you off

20:09.909 --> 20:11.644
if I refer to you as
"Unlucky Tucky"

20:11.711 --> 20:13.112
in court tomorrow?
(chuckles)

20:13.179 --> 20:15.214
That is a low blow,
counselor.

20:15.282 --> 20:17.684
That is a low,
low, low, low blow.

20:17.750 --> 20:18.551
Yeah.

20:18.618 --> 20:19.619
Like low... like real low?

20:19.686 --> 20:21.153
I'll see you
in court.

20:21.220 --> 20:24.257
* Unlucky Tucky *

20:24.324 --> 20:27.994
* You're unlucky, Tucky. *

20:28.060 --> 20:30.263
I'm sure Rose can handle Harley.

20:30.330 --> 20:31.764
Look, it's a piece
of cake, all right?

20:31.831 --> 20:33.266
They're watching the
festival get set up,

20:33.333 --> 20:35.302
they have the bounce
house to themselves.

20:35.368 --> 20:37.036
Harley does love
a bounce house.

20:37.103 --> 20:38.871
And when they get hungry,
there's pizza and snacks

20:38.938 --> 20:40.707
back over at my place,
all right?

20:40.773 --> 20:41.608
They'll be fine.

20:41.674 --> 20:43.710
Now, speaking of refreshments...

20:43.776 --> 20:45.111
(clears throat)

20:45.177 --> 20:47.780
...which wine do you like
to go with your sailing?

20:47.847 --> 20:48.948
Red or white?

20:49.015 --> 20:50.283
One of each.

20:50.350 --> 20:51.484
Ooh.

20:51.551 --> 20:52.652
I want to enlist
in your navy.

20:52.719 --> 20:54.120
All right,
let's hit it.

20:54.186 --> 20:56.323
(phone ringing)

20:58.157 --> 20:59.626
Already?

20:59.692 --> 21:02.128
Hey, Rose, there better be
fire trucks on their way

21:02.194 --> 21:03.563
to my house right now.

21:03.630 --> 21:05.965
No fire but it's definitely
an emergency.

21:06.032 --> 21:08.401
You have to come home.

21:08.468 --> 21:10.236
This guy was being really mean
to his goat.

21:10.303 --> 21:12.305
He says he was gonna
kill it and eat it.

21:12.372 --> 21:13.973
Maybe not even
in that order.

21:14.040 --> 21:15.475
ROSE: It really felt
like we had
(goat bleats)

21:15.542 --> 21:17.377
no choice. We had
to liberate the goat.

21:17.444 --> 21:18.911
Look at that face.

21:18.978 --> 21:21.914
(stammers)
What do you want us
to do with it?

21:21.981 --> 21:24.584
Can we take him home, Mom?

21:24.651 --> 21:26.886
Oh. You know what?
Our neighborhood has a strict

21:26.953 --> 21:28.321
no-goat policy.

21:28.388 --> 21:30.323
But what's gonna happen?

21:30.390 --> 21:32.291
He can't get eaten.

21:33.393 --> 21:34.894
Well...

21:34.961 --> 21:38.465
Oh, yeah. Well, um,
I'll guess I'll take care of it.

21:38.531 --> 21:41.300
Come here, little guy.

21:41.368 --> 21:42.669
All right.
See?

21:42.735 --> 21:44.337
HARLEY:
What are you gonna do
with him?

21:44.404 --> 21:46.339
Oh, there's farm
animal sanctuaries.

21:46.406 --> 21:48.775
Like a no-kill farm
where animals can run free.

21:48.841 --> 21:49.842
Yeah. Yeah.

21:49.909 --> 21:51.478
Yeah, I'll take him
to one of those.

21:51.544 --> 21:53.613
You know, it'll be like a...
little goat spa.

21:53.680 --> 21:55.281
(chuckling):
It'll be-be
great. You know,

21:55.348 --> 21:56.449
get a small Korean man
to give him

21:56.516 --> 21:57.817
a scrub and a...
Okay. All right.

21:57.884 --> 21:59.519
I'm gonna get
this little guy home.

21:59.586 --> 22:01.287
That's a little too much
excitement for one day.

22:01.354 --> 22:03.089
Okay.

22:03.155 --> 22:04.223
Hey, um,

22:04.290 --> 22:05.692
I'm sorry about tonight.

22:05.758 --> 22:07.627
I was really
looking forward to it.

22:07.694 --> 22:10.363
It's all right.
You know what next week is?

22:10.430 --> 22:13.566
Our three month
and one week anniversary.

22:16.135 --> 22:17.604
(sighs)

22:17.670 --> 22:20.339
You do realize
you're not getting paid, hmm?

22:20.407 --> 22:23.109
(goat bleats,
Wade speaks indistinctly)

22:24.577 --> 22:26.779
Chicken will drop
the lawsuit for 50 bucks

22:26.846 --> 22:29.749
and one date with AnnaBeth.
We can talk her into one date.

22:29.816 --> 22:32.018
A.B. is our friend.
We are not doing that to her.

22:32.084 --> 22:33.553
It's offensive.

22:33.620 --> 22:34.921
It's not offens...
What are you talking about?

22:34.987 --> 22:36.623
You do stuff like this
all the time.

22:36.689 --> 22:38.791
This is a typical BlueBell
escapade. I'm telling you,

22:38.858 --> 22:41.461
on the scale of hijinks,
this is barely a three.

22:41.528 --> 22:43.195
A.B. is still getting over
a breakup, okay?

22:43.262 --> 22:45.331
She's not in a good place.
We are not setting her up

22:45.398 --> 22:48.200
with Chicken. And I told you not
to talk to the Truitts.

22:48.267 --> 22:51.538
Yes, but I did anyway and,
guess what, I found a solution.

22:51.604 --> 22:52.739
Pimping out A.B.?

22:52.805 --> 22:54.340
It's not...
Look, George Tucker

22:54.407 --> 22:57.577
is handling this as we speak.
Would you just trust him?

22:57.644 --> 22:59.412
Oh, my God, you guys
should have been at Fancie's.

22:59.479 --> 23:02.549
Lily Anne Lonergan sang
the most amazing set,

23:02.615 --> 23:05.485
and get this...
all about George Tucker.

23:05.552 --> 23:07.253
What?
George was at Fancie's.

23:07.319 --> 23:08.688
Oh, he left after
the first song.

23:08.755 --> 23:10.490
I think he may have been
a little bothered by it.

23:10.557 --> 23:12.324
Or maybe he's finally
getting seasick

23:12.391 --> 23:13.693
from living
on that boat.

23:13.760 --> 23:16.195
He checked into
the Shamrock Motel.

23:16.262 --> 23:18.397
Oh! Hot mulled wine.

23:20.933 --> 23:22.435
Shamrock Motel?

23:22.502 --> 23:25.004
So... new plan.

23:25.071 --> 23:26.906
Why don't we set AnnaBeth
up with Chicken?

23:26.973 --> 23:28.441
You think?

23:33.145 --> 23:34.346
You'd be doing
what you're doing anyways--

23:34.413 --> 23:35.615
fighting over me--

23:35.682 --> 23:36.816
but in suits of armor,

23:36.883 --> 23:38.250
in front of the whole town.

23:38.317 --> 23:40.152
I mean, it makes sense, right?

23:41.854 --> 23:44.824
Yes, but what makes
more sense is if...

23:44.891 --> 23:46.258
If you just
decide.

23:46.325 --> 23:47.426
You know,
think about it.

23:47.494 --> 23:48.828
Tell us who
you'd prefer.

23:48.895 --> 23:50.329
Listen, I have already
pondered myself

23:50.396 --> 23:51.531
into a dead faint.

23:51.598 --> 23:52.932
I'm fine now,

23:52.999 --> 23:54.767
but clearly this decision
is bigger than me.

23:54.834 --> 23:58.204
Well, I did do some
stage fighting at university.

23:58.270 --> 23:59.672
And my
uncle was

23:59.739 --> 24:02.374
a matador, so I have
smelled death up close.

24:02.441 --> 24:03.776
This should be
tamer than that.

24:03.843 --> 24:05.945
Classic dueling
rules apply.

24:06.012 --> 24:08.380
The first man to lose
his weapon is out.

24:08.447 --> 24:11.417
The winner gets to escort me
to the Renaissance Party,

24:11.484 --> 24:13.085
and secures exclusive
dating rights,

24:13.152 --> 24:14.821
as that's how things
were done back then.

24:14.887 --> 24:16.556
I'm not sure
that's 100% accurate.

24:16.623 --> 24:19.025
Please.

24:19.091 --> 24:20.627
I see no other way.

24:23.963 --> 24:25.698
Why, sÃ­.

24:25.765 --> 24:28.668
Â¡Santiago y cierra!
A duel it is!

24:30.903 --> 24:32.972
No, no, BlueBell's
not that kind of town.

24:33.039 --> 24:35.608
We have very little crime here.

24:35.675 --> 24:37.510
Okay, look, you have
my word as mayor

24:37.577 --> 24:38.845
that I will make this right.

24:38.911 --> 24:40.547
All right?
We will find your goat.

24:40.613 --> 24:42.081
(goat bleats)

24:43.349 --> 24:44.216
(bleats)

24:45.518 --> 24:48.220
Hey, let me call
you right back.

24:49.589 --> 24:50.990
Wade?

24:51.057 --> 24:51.824
Yeah?

24:51.891 --> 24:53.292
Return the damn goat.

24:53.359 --> 24:54.794
Will do.

24:56.162 --> 24:58.731
Why'd you do that to me?

25:06.205 --> 25:09.609
Guys, I'm having
second thoughts about this.

25:09.676 --> 25:10.810
What?
No, no second thoughts.

25:10.877 --> 25:12.879
Chicken's gonna
be here any minute.

25:12.945 --> 25:14.046
Yeah, but he's still
gonna be Chicken.

25:14.113 --> 25:15.514
ZOE:
Look-look at it this way.

25:15.582 --> 25:17.449
You know?
We all kiss a lot of frogs

25:17.516 --> 25:19.351
on our way to finding
Prince Charming.

25:19.418 --> 25:20.553
But, you know...

25:20.620 --> 25:21.854
Okay, fine,
quit selling.

25:21.921 --> 25:22.889
(sighs)

25:22.955 --> 25:24.256
Because you are
my friends,

25:24.323 --> 25:26.092
I will do this.
Now go.

25:26.158 --> 25:28.995
I need to mentally
prepare myself for this.

25:29.061 --> 25:30.062
Thank you.

25:30.129 --> 25:31.063
Thank you.

25:48.715 --> 25:49.849
What do you think
you're doing?

25:59.125 --> 26:01.728
Waiting for a man
named Chicken:

26:01.794 --> 26:04.964
the AnnaBeth Nass story.

26:08.567 --> 26:10.436
Carter Covington?

26:10.502 --> 26:11.503
Meatball.
(laughs)

26:11.570 --> 26:13.640
I'm a big fan.

26:13.706 --> 26:15.041
Any chance I could
get an autograph?

26:15.107 --> 26:17.309
Sure.
You're fighting

26:17.376 --> 26:18.711
Enrique Corona today.

26:18.778 --> 26:20.179
Man, have you
got guts.

26:20.246 --> 26:22.414
You know it's just
for show, right?

26:22.481 --> 26:23.415
What?

26:23.482 --> 26:24.416
Oh, yeah, sure.

26:24.483 --> 26:26.085
But they did

26:26.152 --> 26:27.854
tell you about
Enrique, right?

26:27.920 --> 26:30.122
What am I saying?
Of course they did.

26:30.189 --> 26:32.458
(laughs)

26:32.524 --> 26:33.626
Told me what?

26:33.693 --> 26:34.927
Oh, you know.

26:34.994 --> 26:36.428
How he killed
three men

26:36.495 --> 26:37.563
in Renaissance
duels in Europe.

26:37.630 --> 26:38.564
Ah, the third guy

26:38.631 --> 26:39.766
he didn't kill,

26:39.832 --> 26:41.033
but a life
without both arms?

26:41.100 --> 26:42.769
What kind of life
is that, am I right?

26:42.835 --> 26:44.771
Hey, good luck today.

26:44.837 --> 26:46.038
Knock 'em dead.

26:49.575 --> 26:51.911
(indistinct chatter,
music playing)

27:00.486 --> 27:02.421
Oh, this is
amazing.

27:02.488 --> 27:03.990
The big duel's
gonna sell out

27:04.056 --> 27:05.591
and get you your
perfect boyfriend.

27:05.658 --> 27:07.059
(laughs)
This is a good day, Lemon.

27:07.126 --> 27:08.460
Yeah...

27:08.527 --> 27:09.762
What's wrong?

27:09.829 --> 27:12.564
Lavon, I have no idea
who I'm rooting for.

27:12.631 --> 27:13.966
If I end up
with Carter,

27:14.033 --> 27:15.735
does that mean that
I'm just limiting myself

27:15.802 --> 27:17.603
to the safe and
the comfortable?

27:17.670 --> 27:19.371
Drawing the boundaries
of Lemon Breeland

27:19.438 --> 27:20.740
in permanent ink?

27:20.807 --> 27:22.074
Well, the winner
could be Enrique.

27:22.141 --> 27:23.609
He-he's full
of surprises.

27:23.676 --> 27:25.611
Sure, I mean,
Enrique is

27:25.678 --> 27:27.113
one adventure
after another.

27:27.179 --> 27:28.881
But what happens when
the novelty wears off

27:28.948 --> 27:30.883
and we're left with
no common ground?

27:30.950 --> 27:32.785
Then we're like a...
like a tiger

27:32.852 --> 27:34.620
and an Indian boy
in a very small boat.

27:34.687 --> 27:36.889
Yeah, I didn't get
that movie either.

27:36.956 --> 27:38.457
Look, the good
news is...

27:38.524 --> 27:39.959
it's up to the
universe now.

27:40.026 --> 27:41.260
(laughs)
Oh! Oh, come on.

27:41.327 --> 27:43.429
The opening act's
about to start.

27:48.534 --> 27:49.601
ZOE:
A.B.?

27:49.668 --> 27:52.304
Uh... the date's over already?

27:52.371 --> 27:53.472
How'd it go?

27:53.539 --> 27:54.707
It didn't.

27:54.774 --> 27:55.875
What do
you mean?

27:55.942 --> 27:58.044
I mean he never showed.

27:58.110 --> 28:00.146
What? Well, that doesn't
make any sense.

28:00.212 --> 28:03.515
So... for those of you
following at home,

28:03.582 --> 28:06.185
not only do I have
 no love in my life,

28:06.252 --> 28:07.920
I just got stood up
by Chicken Truitt.

28:07.987 --> 28:10.356
Best Renaissance
Faire ever.

28:14.026 --> 28:15.461
Oh, poor AnnaBeth.

28:15.527 --> 28:16.628
Yeah.
Poor AnnaBeth.

28:16.695 --> 28:18.130
Poor us.
Plan "B" didn't work.

28:18.197 --> 28:19.531
We're supposed
to be in court.

28:19.598 --> 28:21.067
Still radio silence
from George?

28:21.133 --> 28:22.401
I'm working on a Plan "C."

28:22.468 --> 28:23.702
Okay, good.
Good.

28:23.770 --> 28:25.104
As long as it
doesn't involve you

28:25.171 --> 28:26.939
passing yourself
off as a lawyer

28:27.006 --> 28:28.975
because you've seen
 Legally Blonde six times.

28:30.476 --> 28:31.577
Oh, come on,
seriously?

28:31.643 --> 28:32.611
That was it?

28:32.678 --> 28:34.814
It's a really good movie.

28:36.715 --> 28:38.650
We're screwed.

28:38.717 --> 28:40.719
(cheering)

28:42.889 --> 28:44.223
DASH:
Ladies and gentlemen,

28:44.290 --> 28:45.557
we are halfway through
our opening duel,

28:45.624 --> 28:47.794
and Sir Tom Long is

28:47.860 --> 28:49.796
really taking a beating
from Sir Maliska.

28:49.862 --> 28:51.730
Tom, d... No!

28:51.798 --> 28:54.400
DASH:
Y'all, this truly could be
a day to dismember!

28:54.466 --> 28:55.567
(groans)

28:55.634 --> 28:56.836
Sorry
we're late.

28:56.903 --> 28:59.305
Yeah, we went past
the petting zoo and...

28:59.371 --> 29:00.539
Laszlo was in there!

29:00.606 --> 29:01.540
My goat.

29:01.607 --> 29:02.775
He named him.

29:02.842 --> 29:04.710
You promised
you'd bring Laszlo

29:04.777 --> 29:06.478
to a no-kill goat spa.

29:06.545 --> 29:07.646
But you gave him back.

29:07.713 --> 29:08.981
Look, Harley,

29:09.048 --> 29:10.582
I had no choice,
all right?

29:10.649 --> 29:12.084
Lavon got a call
from the guy.

29:12.151 --> 29:13.853
You stole his
goat, buddy.

29:13.920 --> 29:15.721
Now he's gonna
turn him into stew!

29:15.788 --> 29:17.323
And eat him!

29:17.389 --> 29:20.059
(sighs)

29:20.126 --> 29:20.860
Mmm...

29:20.927 --> 29:22.194
Okay. Hey.

29:22.261 --> 29:24.130
Harley...

29:24.196 --> 29:26.232
let's go see a guy
about a goat, huh?

29:27.266 --> 29:28.467
All right.

29:28.534 --> 29:30.036
(cheering)

29:30.102 --> 29:30.669
(grunts)

29:30.736 --> 29:31.503
(crowd exclaims)

29:35.741 --> 29:36.675
You win, you win.

29:36.742 --> 29:37.844
I'm...

29:37.910 --> 29:40.646
(cheering)

29:40.712 --> 29:42.414
Ladies and gentlemen,

29:42.481 --> 29:44.984
we have come to the end
of our opening duel.

29:45.051 --> 29:47.820
But please, don't go anywhere,

29:47.887 --> 29:49.655
because we have
our main event coming up.

29:49.721 --> 29:51.690
The Hella in BlueBella.

29:51.757 --> 29:54.861
Sir Carter versus Sir Enrique

29:54.927 --> 29:57.463
and they'll be dueling
for the lovely heart

29:57.529 --> 29:58.530
of Queen Lemon.

30:01.733 --> 30:03.735
Enrique Corona,
right?

30:03.802 --> 30:05.237
Yes?

30:05.304 --> 30:07.073
Meatball.

30:07.139 --> 30:08.174
Big fan.

30:08.240 --> 30:10.442
Any chance I can
get an autograph?

30:16.282 --> 30:17.216
I remind you

30:17.283 --> 30:18.550
that the winner of this duel

30:18.617 --> 30:21.220
will be escorting Queen Lemon

30:21.287 --> 30:23.022
to the Renaissance Party
tonight.

30:23.089 --> 30:24.823
(crowd cheering)
Now, Sir Carter,

30:24.891 --> 30:26.825
Sir Enrique,

30:26.893 --> 30:28.560
please enter the ring!

30:28.627 --> 30:30.562
(drumroll)

30:36.903 --> 30:38.704
Uh, knights, again...

30:38.770 --> 30:41.707
please enter the ring!

30:41.773 --> 30:44.911
(drumroll, crowd cheering)

30:44.977 --> 30:46.345
What's happening?

30:46.412 --> 30:47.546
Where are they?

30:47.613 --> 30:49.081
Uh, trouble

30:49.148 --> 30:50.917
putting on their armor, maybe?

30:50.983 --> 30:52.251
Sir Carter! Sir Enrique!

30:52.318 --> 30:53.852
I command that
you enter the ring!

30:53.920 --> 30:56.088
(drumroll)

30:59.325 --> 31:02.929
Is anybody gonna fight for
the hand of Queen Lemon?

31:02.995 --> 31:04.096
(crowd murmuring)

31:04.163 --> 31:05.898
This is getting
embarrassing.

31:13.872 --> 31:15.707
I will fight
for Queen Lemon!

31:15.774 --> 31:19.011
Oh, thank God.
(crowd cheers)

31:19.078 --> 31:21.747
Well, speak your
name, knight.

31:21.813 --> 31:23.649
You can call me...

31:29.555 --> 31:30.689
...Sir Meatball.

31:30.756 --> 31:31.958
(gasps)

31:33.092 --> 31:35.027
Oh, no.
Oh, no-no-no-no.

31:35.094 --> 31:37.529
This isn't happening.

31:37.596 --> 31:41.567
Your Royal Highness,
it looks like I'm flying solo.

31:41.633 --> 31:45.037
Doth that not mean
I win by default?

31:45.104 --> 31:47.073
(all laugh)

31:48.840 --> 31:50.342
Lavon, you better fix this,

31:50.409 --> 31:53.245
or I swear to God,
heads will roll.

31:53.312 --> 31:54.480
Doth it?

32:02.121 --> 32:04.056
Hey, check out Laszlo.
He's happy as a clam.

32:04.123 --> 32:06.925
MAN:
Hey, hey, goatburger,

32:06.993 --> 32:08.894
that's my magazine
you're chewing up.

32:08.961 --> 32:10.296
Give me that,
dummy!

32:10.362 --> 32:11.797
You're going to be one
sorry shish kebab.

32:11.863 --> 32:13.899
Shish kebab! Ah!

32:13.966 --> 32:15.934
(Laszlo bleats)

32:16.002 --> 32:18.170
Maybe, uh...
maybe, let's go.

32:18.237 --> 32:19.505
(Laszlo bleats)

32:21.073 --> 32:23.709
I've reviewed the complaint.
Have we reached a settlement?

32:23.775 --> 32:27.113
Oh, we tried, Your Honor,
but as opposing counsel

32:27.179 --> 32:30.349
couldn't even bother
to attend this hearing,

32:30.416 --> 32:33.485
we move for a directed verdict
in our favor.

32:33.552 --> 32:34.953
Wait!

32:35.021 --> 32:37.889
Your Honor, as famous attorney
Elle Woods once said...

32:37.956 --> 32:39.025
Elle Woods?

32:39.091 --> 32:40.492
Legally Blonde?

32:41.827 --> 32:43.695
Sit down.

32:43.762 --> 32:47.333
Now I am inclined to rule
for the plaintiff.

32:47.399 --> 32:49.635
Has anybody heard from...?

32:53.072 --> 32:56.342
George Tucker for the defense,
Your Honor.

32:56.408 --> 32:58.077
Nice of you to join us.

32:58.144 --> 33:01.713
Does Unlucky Tucky
need a new watch?

33:01.780 --> 33:03.749
I do apologize
to the court

33:03.815 --> 33:05.451
for my tardiness.

33:05.517 --> 33:08.354
However, I am
about to save you
a whole lot of time.

33:08.420 --> 33:10.722
The complaint
in front of you

33:10.789 --> 33:13.259
is nothing more than a glorified
nuisance suit, Your Honor,

33:13.325 --> 33:15.394
which is the legal equivalent
of hawking a loogie

33:15.461 --> 33:17.063
on the sidewalk of justice.

33:17.129 --> 33:18.964
The loogie defense? Nice.

33:19.031 --> 33:21.733
Objection, Your Honor.

33:21.800 --> 33:24.002
Despite his colorful
imagery,

33:24.070 --> 33:26.672
Mr. Tucker calling this
a nuisance suit

33:26.738 --> 33:30.276
does not actually make it
a nuisance suit.

33:30.342 --> 33:32.511
True. But what does
make it a nuisance suit

33:32.578 --> 33:34.746
is a complete and total
lack of evidence

33:34.813 --> 33:36.048
on the plaintiff's part.

33:36.115 --> 33:38.684
I have here three medical
reports refuting

33:38.750 --> 33:40.052
Chicken Truitt's injuries.

33:40.119 --> 33:41.553
Did you really think
I would miss those?

33:41.620 --> 33:43.555
As well as precedents
established

33:43.622 --> 33:45.891
by Pearson v. Chung,
 Maxey v. Jefferson County,

33:45.957 --> 33:48.560
and Mahoney v. Loma Alta...

33:48.627 --> 33:51.029
an opinion you yourself
wrote, Your Honor.

33:51.097 --> 33:53.099
And let us not forget

33:53.165 --> 33:56.268
the basic rules of fair play
as taught to us by our mamas.

33:56.335 --> 33:58.970
Your Honor, I move
for a brief recess

33:59.037 --> 34:01.307
so we can have
some time to review

34:01.373 --> 34:03.075
this new evidence.

34:03.142 --> 34:08.313
Okay. Well, legally speaking,
this is what the court refers

34:08.380 --> 34:11.817
to as a no-brainer.
Case dismissed.

34:12.784 --> 34:14.152
ZOE:
Yeah! Dude,

34:14.219 --> 34:16.455
I don't want to tell you
I told you so, but...

34:16.522 --> 34:18.556
Well, you just did.
Hey, counselor,

34:18.623 --> 34:21.592
Unlucky Tucky just kicked
your ass.

34:22.694 --> 34:24.463
Ah.

34:25.664 --> 34:28.467
I have reviewed
the official rules,

34:28.534 --> 34:31.203
and in the absence
of an opponent,

34:31.270 --> 34:34.639
I now declare
Sir Meatball

34:34.706 --> 34:35.873
the victor.

34:35.940 --> 34:36.808
(cheering)

34:38.244 --> 34:39.878
LAVON:
Not so fast.

34:39.945 --> 34:41.713
(all gasp)

34:48.353 --> 34:49.755
(sword rings)

34:49.821 --> 34:54.592
I, Sir Lavon Hayes...
Oh, oh, sorry, sorry.

34:54.659 --> 34:58.230
Sir Mayor Lavon Hayes
challenge Sir Meatball

34:58.297 --> 34:59.898
for the hand
of Queen Lemon.

34:59.965 --> 35:02.100
(applause, cheering)

35:02.168 --> 35:03.769
Seems we got a fight.

35:06.672 --> 35:08.707
Sir Meatball accepts
the challenge.

35:08.774 --> 35:10.309
(drumroll)

35:16.648 --> 35:18.450
(crowd gasping)

35:21.387 --> 35:23.255
Sir Meatball concedes defeat.

35:23.322 --> 35:26.392
(cheering)

35:27.926 --> 35:31.730
I now declare Sir Lavon Hayes
to be the victor.

35:31.797 --> 35:37.068
And he has won the hand
and the heart of Queen Lemon.

35:37.135 --> 35:39.405
And he will be escorting her

35:39.471 --> 35:41.473
to the Renaissance Party
tonight.

35:41.540 --> 35:42.274
Huzzah!

35:42.341 --> 35:43.475
ALL:
Huzzah!

35:43.542 --> 35:44.376
Huzzah!

35:44.443 --> 35:45.577
ALL:
Huzzah!

35:45.644 --> 35:46.745
Huzzah!

35:46.812 --> 35:48.314
ALL:
Huzzah!

35:57.423 --> 36:00.792
Oh! Oh, please,
could somebody
please help me?

36:00.859 --> 36:02.127
I'm very dizzy. Oh!

36:02.194 --> 36:03.995
Oh. Here-here
you go, young lady.

36:04.062 --> 36:05.163
Take my stool.

36:05.231 --> 36:07.132
Oh, I think
I need to sit, yeah.

36:07.199 --> 36:08.600
Ooh, so thirsty.

36:08.667 --> 36:09.868
Oh, easy does it.

36:09.935 --> 36:12.838
VIVIAN:
I think I just
got overwhelmed.

36:12.904 --> 36:14.139
You know, by the

36:14.206 --> 36:16.675
the vapors,
I think.
The vapors?

36:16.742 --> 36:18.710
Oh, I thought we'd
eradicated them.

36:18.777 --> 36:19.945
Whoo!

36:20.011 --> 36:22.147
Deep breaths.

36:22.214 --> 36:25.751
(hushed)
Go, go, go, go, go.

36:25.817 --> 36:28.787
* My mama said *

36:28.854 --> 36:34.660
* "Be careful where
you lay your head" *

36:36.262 --> 36:38.364
We really can't
thank you enough.

36:38.430 --> 36:39.965
No, no, any time.

36:40.031 --> 36:41.199
It was truly my pleasure.

36:41.267 --> 36:42.534
Although, I do have
to ask,

36:42.601 --> 36:44.102
was it just
my imagination,

36:44.169 --> 36:45.904
or were you guys
losing confidence in
me a little bit?

36:45.971 --> 36:47.839
Well, I mean, you did cut it
a little close.

36:47.906 --> 36:49.708
And we weren't sure
you were gonna make it.

36:49.775 --> 36:52.143
That is the power of
a dramatic entrance,
my friend.

36:52.210 --> 36:53.679
That's trial strategy 101.

36:53.745 --> 36:55.547
Well, you have been
a little broken up
over Tansy.

36:55.614 --> 36:57.783
And the last time
you were broken up
over Tansy...

36:57.849 --> 36:59.485
I know, I know.

36:59.551 --> 37:03.154
You heard I melted into a puddle
of despair, pizza and tears.

37:03.221 --> 37:04.756
No one said tears.

37:04.823 --> 37:06.825
Well, guess what?
That was then.

37:06.892 --> 37:10.161
George Tucker,
capable of tremendous
personal growth. Boom.

37:10.228 --> 37:13.465
Well, you know, it's just
that you checked into
the Shamrock Motel,

37:13.532 --> 37:15.434
and I knocked,
and you didn't
let me in.

37:15.501 --> 37:16.802
I checked into
the Shamrock Motel

37:16.868 --> 37:18.970
'cause the plumbing
on my boat is out

37:19.037 --> 37:20.205
and my office
has mold.

37:20.272 --> 37:21.273
And I probably
didn't hear you

37:21.340 --> 37:23.108
'cause I had headphones on.

37:23.174 --> 37:25.611
I like to listen to '90s R&B
when I'm prepping for a trial.

37:25.677 --> 37:28.347
Come on, guys.
Show a little faith.

37:28.414 --> 37:29.981
Show a little faith.
Show a little...

37:30.048 --> 37:32.117
That's what I said.
That's what I told her.

37:32.183 --> 37:33.184
Liar!

37:33.251 --> 37:35.821
Liar.
I did!

37:35.887 --> 37:37.356
Liar!

37:39.525 --> 37:42.494
* "Where you lay your head" *

37:42.561 --> 37:43.762
(hushed):
Hey, Tom, Wanda,

37:43.829 --> 37:45.964
I need to talk
to you for a sec.

37:46.031 --> 37:48.500
You have to speak up.
Tom's hearing's still bad

37:48.567 --> 37:51.036
from getting thumped
by that other knight.

37:51.102 --> 37:54.072
How would you two
like to raise a baby goat?

37:54.139 --> 37:55.106
No questions asked?

37:55.173 --> 37:57.776
Aw...
(bleats)

37:57.843 --> 37:58.810
Oh, sweetie.

37:58.877 --> 38:00.846
Can I touch it?!

38:02.247 --> 38:04.249
Well, boys,
it was, uh, brave of you

38:04.316 --> 38:05.917
to show your faces here.

38:05.984 --> 38:08.654
It almost makes up for your
absence in the ring today.

38:08.720 --> 38:11.523
Almost, but you know, not quite.

38:11.590 --> 38:13.158
I am sorry
about that.
Many apologies.

38:13.224 --> 38:17.429
I thought Enrique here was gonna
chop me limb from limb.

38:17.496 --> 38:19.130
SÃ­. The Meatball

38:19.197 --> 38:21.367
said Carter would eat my heart.

38:21.433 --> 38:22.934
Well, you know what?

38:23.001 --> 38:25.371
I think that it's-it's
probably for the best.

38:25.437 --> 38:27.138
I think it's time

38:27.205 --> 38:28.874
that we said our good-byes.

38:28.940 --> 38:30.876
You couldn't decide?

38:30.942 --> 38:33.812
No, this is my decision.

38:33.879 --> 38:36.582
Carter, my daddy's
gonna miss you,

38:36.648 --> 38:38.316
so just drop him a line
every now and then.

38:38.384 --> 38:40.251
And, Enrique,
I'm so sorry

38:40.318 --> 38:41.953
that you lost your job
with my grandma.

38:42.020 --> 38:45.691
A door shuts,
and a window opens.

38:45.757 --> 38:47.459
I've secured
a new job.

38:47.526 --> 38:50.962
Driving
Mr. Carter Covington.

38:51.029 --> 38:55.401
Well, tha-that's delightful
and a little strange,

38:55.467 --> 38:58.770
but, uh, have safe travels.

38:58.837 --> 39:00.171
Uh, ciao.

39:00.238 --> 39:02.107
Farewell.

39:04.342 --> 39:06.845
* It's a winding path *

39:06.912 --> 39:09.581
* Between the highway
and the coast *

39:09.648 --> 39:11.750
* Where we lost
what mattered most *

39:11.817 --> 39:15.454
* It dissipated in the sun... *

39:15.521 --> 39:18.524
May we have the king and queen,
please?

39:18.590 --> 39:20.392
It is time for the royal dance.

39:20.459 --> 39:21.927
(applause)

39:27.566 --> 39:29.367
(chuckles)

39:29.435 --> 39:32.571
Uh, well, someone
looks relieved.

39:32.638 --> 39:37.175
Ugh, Lavon, I've never
been so happy to be single.

39:37.242 --> 39:38.610
You know why I couldn't pick?

39:38.677 --> 39:41.980
'Cause neither one
was the one?

39:42.047 --> 39:43.515
Exactly.
Oh.

39:43.582 --> 39:45.484
Not on their own, but together,

39:45.551 --> 39:48.787
together they were perfect.

39:48.854 --> 39:51.089
If only I could put 'em
in a blender

39:51.156 --> 39:53.224
and make a boyfriend smoothie.

39:53.291 --> 39:56.061
Wow. I am so grateful

39:56.127 --> 39:58.263
that technology does
not yet exist.

39:58.329 --> 39:59.798
(chuckles)

39:59.865 --> 40:02.468
You keep looking, Lemon.
You're gonna find your smoothie.

40:02.534 --> 40:04.503
So will you.

40:08.974 --> 40:12.511
Um... why don't we split up
and go mingle?

40:12.578 --> 40:14.446
Uh, yeah, you took
the words right out

40:14.513 --> 40:15.914
of my mouth, Your Highness.

40:21.086 --> 40:22.187
Beg pardon, m'lady.

40:22.253 --> 40:23.922
Would it be all right
if I bought

40:23.989 --> 40:26.091
the most beautiful maiden
in here a drink?

40:26.157 --> 40:28.494
I don't know. Who are you?

40:28.560 --> 40:30.496
Your knight in shining armor.

40:30.562 --> 40:33.599
Meatball?

40:35.701 --> 40:38.003
Okay, no Meatball.
Chicken?

40:42.407 --> 40:44.976
Okay, knight in shining armor,

40:45.043 --> 40:46.311
one drink.

40:46.377 --> 40:50.081
Uh! You know what?
Let's, uh, keep the helmet on.

40:50.148 --> 40:55.020
Try not to ruin
the mystery until we have to.

40:55.086 --> 40:57.422
Bye.
Hey!

40:57.489 --> 40:58.657
The lawsuit went away!

40:58.724 --> 41:00.058
Your book is gonna
be a movie!

41:00.125 --> 41:01.760
I told you it would
work out.

41:01.827 --> 41:03.194
Stick with me, kid.

41:03.261 --> 41:05.564
You should use that line
in your screenplay.

41:05.631 --> 41:07.232
Joel, what's the matter?

41:07.298 --> 41:10.268
Well, I just got off the phone
with Bets.

41:10.335 --> 41:11.570
And?

41:11.637 --> 41:14.205
And I have to go to Los Angeles.

41:14.272 --> 41:15.941
What? When?
Yeah.

41:16.007 --> 41:18.176
The studio wants me out there
as soon as possible,

41:18.243 --> 41:20.011
uh, start work on the script,
meet everybody.

41:20.078 --> 41:22.714
Well, how long
are you gonna be gone?

41:22.781 --> 41:26.785
They said... six months.

41:28.620 --> 41:29.921
What?

41:29.988 --> 41:31.122
Come here.

41:31.189 --> 41:34.793
