00:33.183 --> 00:34.033
Let's do this again

00:34.184 --> 00:35.442
and video it for TikTok!

00:35.594 --> 00:36.684
Or maybe we don't

00:36.779 --> 00:38.037
and this is something
that we just do at home

00:38.264 --> 00:39.763
and never tell anyone about.

00:39.782 --> 00:42.949
Fine. But our roommate TikTok
account is never gonna go viral

00:43.044 --> 00:45.285
unless we post something on it.

00:46.047 --> 00:47.212
Do you want popcorn
with the movie?

00:47.364 --> 00:48.881
-Wait, what movie?
-Oh.

00:49.032 --> 00:50.716
<i> Love Actually</i> is on
in five minutes.

00:50.867 --> 00:52.793
I put it
on the roommate calendar.

00:52.887 --> 00:54.202
(scoffs)
I'm really tired.

00:54.221 --> 00:55.387
Can we just stream it
another night?

00:55.614 --> 00:57.872
It is so much better
to watch it in real time.

00:58.041 --> 00:59.058
Like, with commercials?

00:59.285 --> 01:00.284
Exactly.

01:00.286 --> 01:01.301
That's when we talk
about the flaws.

01:01.453 --> 01:02.877
Like the Hugh Grant story.

01:02.897 --> 01:05.289
I mean, the prime minister
falling for his junior staffer?

01:05.382 --> 01:06.899
That's
totally sexual harassment,

01:07.050 --> 01:08.975
given the power imbalance.

01:09.128 --> 01:10.885
Ooh, or what about that guy

01:10.905 --> 01:13.221
who creeps on his best friend's
wife with those stupid signs?

01:13.315 --> 01:14.573
You know, for a semi-stalker,

01:14.724 --> 01:16.241
he has
very delicate handwriting.

01:16.468 --> 01:18.577
Right. So we unpack all that

01:18.728 --> 01:21.822
and then we get back to watching
the romantic movie that we love,

01:21.957 --> 01:22.973
actually.

01:23.066 --> 01:24.065
Okay, fine.

01:24.159 --> 01:25.492
Let the mixed feelings begin.

01:25.644 --> 01:28.478
Yay! It's so much better
to discuss it with a roommate.

01:28.497 --> 01:30.756
Why? 'Cause normally
you discuss it with yourself?

01:30.983 --> 01:32.482
No, that would be weird.

01:32.576 --> 01:35.152
I absolutely do that.

a slice of my banana bread

01:43.512 --> 01:48.089
to help you
on your long, sweaty ride.

01:48.167 --> 01:49.833
Thanks, Phil.

01:49.852 --> 01:50.776
You're the best.

01:50.927 --> 01:52.686
(chuckling)

01:53.614 --> 01:58.099
That man is finer than
a frog hair split four ways.

01:58.193 --> 01:59.767
I am too tired
to have an opinion

01:59.787 --> 02:02.287
about some old guy's frog hair.

02:03.290 --> 02:04.197
Sorry. I'm in a mood.

02:04.350 --> 02:05.607
Kat had me up all night.

02:05.626 --> 02:07.351
Oh, that must be fun--

02:07.369 --> 02:08.627
two girls living together,

02:08.854 --> 02:10.612
painting each other's toenails

02:10.631 --> 02:12.280
and having pillow fights.

02:12.299 --> 02:14.282
Is that what you think
two adult women do at night?

02:14.301 --> 02:15.950
Well, actually,
there was a pillow fight,

02:15.970 --> 02:18.545
which I kind of liked because
I destroyed her. (chuckles)

02:18.639 --> 02:21.306
Look, I'm not saying
that it's not fun sometimes.

02:21.533 --> 02:23.425
But Kat wants to have fun
every night.

02:23.477 --> 02:25.202
Well, honey,
you need to talk to her.

02:25.220 --> 02:28.538
No. I mean, she's saving my ass
by letting me stay with her.

02:28.557 --> 02:29.556
I just can't wait
till I get enough money

02:29.708 --> 02:30.798
to get my own place.

02:30.818 --> 02:33.210
I'm sure it'll be nice
to have a bed again.

02:33.228 --> 02:35.470
Oh, it will.
My back is killing me.

02:35.489 --> 02:37.381
The only people who should
be sleeping on couches

02:37.399 --> 02:39.158
are drunk frat boys
and sisters who broke up

03:19.591 --> 03:23.410
Especially the liberties
she's taking with her rhymes.

03:24.538 --> 03:25.762

We did that upstairs already.

03:30.769 --> 03:31.543
Is she okay?

03:31.620 --> 03:33.194
Her back is a little sore

03:33.288 --> 03:34.713
from sleeping on your couch.

03:47.895 --> 03:49.877
Damn, this is messed up.

03:49.972 --> 03:50.971
Climate change?

03:51.123 --> 03:52.231
The increasing wage gap?

03:52.382 --> 03:54.900
The uphill battle
for social justice and equality?

03:55.051 --> 03:56.476
Uh, no.

03:56.628 --> 03:59.220
But now what I'm about to say
is gonna sound really petty.

03:59.314 --> 04:00.630
I'm talking about
this month's Bourbon Crawl.

04:00.632 --> 04:02.632
The list came out
and we're not on it.

04:02.726 --> 04:04.317
How is it possible the Middle C
didn't make the list

04:04.470 --> 04:05.727
but Pete's Watering Hole did?

04:05.788 --> 04:08.321
Probably because Pete
keeps adding new bourbons.

04:08.474 --> 04:11.250
They have this 20-year-old
reserve that is so smooth,

04:11.401 --> 04:14.311
it's like a lover whispering
in your ear.

04:14.329 --> 04:16.070
Are you cheating on
the Middle C?

04:16.090 --> 04:17.739
Well, maybe if you spiced things
up on the bourbon shelf,

04:17.758 --> 04:20.241
I wouldn't have to look
elsewhere to have my needs met.

04:20.335 --> 04:22.594
Okay, we are in a weird area,

04:22.821 --> 04:23.929
but I get your point.

04:24.156 --> 04:25.505
We got to up our bourbon game.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.081
(singsongy):
Hey.

04:27.159 --> 04:28.508
-(singsongy): Hey.
-MAX: Aw.

04:28.602 --> 04:31.919
Look at you two, with
your hey-heys and your smiles.

04:31.939 --> 04:33.497
So cute.

04:33.515 --> 04:35.774
Ew. See? That's why I didn't
want to tell anyone about us.

04:35.925 --> 04:38.351
In his defense,
we are pretty damn cute.

04:38.445 --> 04:41.613
Okay, so I know my rule is
to never stay over

04:41.765 --> 04:42.948
more than two nights a week,

04:43.099 --> 04:44.449
but I have to get some sleep.

04:44.601 --> 04:45.617
So can I s...

04:45.694 --> 04:47.360
Stay over tonight? Hell yeah!

04:47.513 --> 04:49.121
I'll make you dinner.
Do you like coq au vin?

04:49.272 --> 04:50.271
I don't know how to make it.

04:50.365 --> 04:51.606
I'm not even sure what it is.

04:51.625 --> 04:53.366
But, for you,
I'll figure it out.

04:53.519 --> 04:54.275
You know what?

04:54.295 --> 04:56.036
-(chuckles) Forget it.
-Oh.

04:56.188 --> 04:58.112
I now remember
why there was a rule in place.

04:58.206 --> 04:59.798
You are way too into this.

04:59.949 --> 05:01.207
(chuckles)

05:02.027 --> 05:04.118
Unlike
Pete's 20-year-old reserve,

05:04.196 --> 05:06.287
that was not smooth.

05:06.307 --> 05:08.807
I know. My brain was like,

05:09.034 --> 05:09.808
"Play it cool."

05:10.035 --> 05:10.976
But my mouth was like...

05:11.127 --> 05:12.394
(high-pitched):
"It's happening!"

05:14.964 --> 05:16.648
-You ready for your surprise?
-(chuckles)

05:16.800 --> 05:19.151
On the count of three,
we both take off our blindfolds.

05:19.320 --> 05:20.802
Why do you have a blindfold on?

05:20.821 --> 05:23.730
Because I want to experience it
right alongside you.

05:23.882 --> 05:26.474
Is that why it took so long
to get up the stairs?

05:26.568 --> 05:29.310
Well, I now see
the flaw in my plan.

05:29.404 --> 05:30.478
Okay. Three steps down.

05:30.572 --> 05:33.648
You... are gonna love me
when you see this.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.575
Now, don't feel like you have
to say that you love me.

05:35.727 --> 05:37.894
But if you want to say
that you love me, go ahead.

05:38.063 --> 05:39.588
Or don't. Again, up to you.

05:41.342 --> 05:42.899
Ta-da!

05:42.992 --> 05:44.234
Where's the couch?

05:44.252 --> 05:45.510
At the thrift store!
It was hurting your back,

05:45.737 --> 05:46.903
so I got you a new one!

05:46.922 --> 05:49.072
And this one folds out
into a bed!

05:49.091 --> 05:50.182
How much do you love me?

05:50.333 --> 05:52.834
I had $2,000 hidden
in that couch!

05:52.928 --> 05:54.001
What?!

05:54.838 --> 05:56.646
You can tell me
you love me later.

06:02.011 --> 06:03.695
Why would you hide
all that money

06:03.697 --> 06:05.105
in the couch?
What about a bank?

06:05.107 --> 06:06.681
I like to keep my money close,
okay?

06:06.683 --> 06:08.367
I need to see it
first thing in the morning

06:08.369 --> 06:10.093
and say good night to it
before I go to bed.

06:10.112 --> 06:13.205
And now it's out there,
alone and in the cold.

06:13.356 --> 06:14.689
Well, i-if it helps, the
weather's supposed to stay warm

06:14.783 --> 06:16.691
through the end of the w--
Okay, that's not helping.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.268
I have been saving for months.

06:18.361 --> 06:20.194
That money was for me
to get my own place.

06:20.272 --> 06:22.214
You gave away my escape fund!

06:23.217 --> 06:24.866
Your "escape fund"?

06:24.885 --> 06:25.942
I didn't mean that.

06:25.961 --> 06:27.277
Well, what did you mean?

06:27.370 --> 06:29.629
I just meant that
I can't live here forever, Kat.

06:29.781 --> 06:31.873
Eventually,
I have to get my own place.

06:31.967 --> 06:33.392
And I want that for you.

06:33.577 --> 06:35.894
I can't wait to come over
with salt and bread.

06:36.121 --> 06:37.229
It's a Jewish thing.

06:37.380 --> 06:38.455
You should never go hungry,

06:38.548 --> 06:39.639
may your life be full
of flavor...

06:39.791 --> 06:40.882
Let's talk about this later.

06:41.793 --> 06:43.977
I had no idea
you've been so unhappy.

06:44.129 --> 06:45.070
I'm not unhappy.

06:45.330 --> 06:46.296
It's just that...

06:46.389 --> 06:48.298
you always want to have fun!

06:48.391 --> 06:50.300
Like, all the time!
You're very perky!

06:50.393 --> 06:53.394
Wow. So you need
to "escape" my "perky"?

06:56.324 --> 06:57.582

07:46.282 --> 07:47.857
When is one ever better
than ten?

07:47.951 --> 07:50.117
One stab wound
is better than ten.

07:50.137 --> 07:51.136
How 'bout STDs,

07:51.287 --> 07:52.862
snakes, clowns...

07:52.881 --> 07:55.623
Oh, yeah, you never want to be
in a room with ten clowns.

07:55.642 --> 07:57.726
I'm currently in a room
with two.

07:59.204 --> 08:00.461
Now, this is important,

08:00.481 --> 08:02.630
so we need
to really, really stay focused.

08:03.317 --> 08:06.376
-(laughing)
-I was going old-school
on the dance floor.

08:06.469 --> 08:08.061
-I was doing the Dougie.
-Oh!

08:08.155 --> 08:10.380
Doing the Running Man.

08:10.473 --> 08:11.381
(chuckles)

08:11.383 --> 08:13.474
I was acting like a fool
for her!

08:13.494 --> 08:15.309
You got to do
what you got to do!

08:15.329 --> 08:17.144
-(chuckles)
-And then what happened?

08:17.164 --> 08:19.389
Well, I tried to seal the deal
by krumping.

08:19.482 --> 08:21.574
I turned around,
she was walking away.

08:21.727 --> 08:23.393
Well, you don't krump at a lady.

08:23.486 --> 08:25.078
<i> -You</i> don't krump at all!
-(chuckling)

08:25.154 --> 08:26.913
I know. I know.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.231
And she was so cool.

08:28.233 --> 08:29.232
I tried calling after her,

08:29.251 --> 08:30.900
but I couldn't remember
her name.

08:30.994 --> 08:32.252
Oh, man, that is the worst.

08:32.404 --> 08:34.237
-Mm-hmm.
-I always use a mnemonic.

08:34.406 --> 08:37.407
When I met Carter, I said,
"Carter, Farter."

08:37.576 --> 08:38.908
(laughing)

08:38.927 --> 08:40.744
When I met Max,

08:40.762 --> 08:41.669
I said,

08:41.688 --> 08:43.747
"He's hot. I won't forget him."

08:43.765 --> 08:45.248
(laughs)

08:45.934 --> 08:47.433
You know,
it's fun to be out there again,

08:47.510 --> 08:49.419
but I wouldn't mind being
in a relationship like you.

08:49.437 --> 08:51.345
Randi won't let us use
the R-word.

08:51.439 --> 08:54.107
She calls it a "situationship."

08:54.201 --> 08:55.775
PHIL:
Is she crazy?

08:55.944 --> 08:57.277
You're a catch.

08:57.429 --> 08:59.204
You've got everything
a woman could want,

08:59.355 --> 09:02.189
and your hair is
a gravitational wonder!

09:02.267 --> 09:03.783
(Max chuckles)

09:03.935 --> 09:04.784
To Carter's hair!

09:04.878 --> 09:05.877
(chuckling)

09:06.104 --> 09:07.045
What about you, Phil?

09:07.196 --> 09:09.122
Anyone out there
tickling your fancy?

09:09.198 --> 09:11.216
Well, there is
this one gentleman

09:11.367 --> 09:14.535
who shows up every morning
in his little bike outfit.

09:14.629 --> 09:17.797
He's got a fancy
I wouldn't mind ticklin'.

09:17.949 --> 09:19.783
-(chuckles) Well, go for it!
-(Carter chuckles)

09:19.785 --> 09:20.725
You got to hit that!

09:20.760 --> 09:21.726
Oh! Oh, no, no, no.

09:21.878 --> 09:24.045
That man
would not be interested in me.

09:24.064 --> 09:26.047
Max, we have
to make this happen.

09:26.215 --> 09:27.473
Here's what you're gonna do.

09:27.568 --> 09:29.383
You're gonna invite him
to go ride bikes

09:29.403 --> 09:30.735
on that trail by the lake.

09:30.962 --> 09:31.811
Oh, strong start.

09:31.963 --> 09:33.146
I'm liking this.

09:33.240 --> 09:36.057
Then, just as the water
comes into view,

09:36.076 --> 09:37.133
you get a cramp in your leg.

09:37.152 --> 09:38.301
But-- how convenient--

09:38.320 --> 09:39.578
under
that beautiful willow tree,

09:39.729 --> 09:42.747
someone has left a bottle
of wine and two glasses.

09:42.899 --> 09:44.490
Who? Who did that?

09:44.643 --> 09:46.142
We did, you idiot!

09:46.144 --> 09:47.310
I'm the idiot?

09:47.403 --> 09:48.828
You think two grown men
are gonna drink

09:48.922 --> 09:51.481
an open bottle of wine that they
find on the side of the road?

09:51.574 --> 09:52.573
Phil would be in on it!

09:52.593 --> 09:54.651
Well,
you should've made that clear!

09:54.744 --> 09:57.912
Oh, boys, boys, boys,
this is all very sweet,

09:57.931 --> 09:59.264
but it's not gonna work.

09:59.415 --> 10:01.582
I don't know how to ride a bike.

10:01.718 --> 10:02.917
What? How is that possible?

10:02.936 --> 10:04.251
No one taught you?

10:04.346 --> 10:06.996
Well, my dad gave me
my brother's old bike,

10:07.165 --> 10:09.090
but I wanted my sister's.

10:09.109 --> 10:10.442
It was pink.

10:10.593 --> 10:12.277
It had sparkly streamers

10:12.504 --> 10:15.338
and a big basket
filled with plastic flowers.

10:15.357 --> 10:16.430
I loved it.

10:16.450 --> 10:20.118
But when my father saw me
sitting on it,

10:20.195 --> 10:23.863
he just shook his head
and walked in the house.

10:24.015 --> 10:25.698
Sorry, Phil.

10:25.792 --> 10:26.774
That's tough.

10:26.793 --> 10:28.943
I was so ashamed.

10:28.962 --> 10:30.945
I never got on that bike again.

10:30.964 --> 10:32.655
Or any other bike.

10:33.467 --> 10:35.224
I know
exactly what we have to do.

10:35.360 --> 10:37.284
Desecrate his father's grave.

10:37.304 --> 10:39.545
No. Teach him
how to ride a bike.

10:39.640 --> 10:40.972
Why do we always have
to do what you want?

10:41.199 --> 10:42.807
If there's time, we can do both!

10:43.034 --> 10:45.459
Oh! You guys are the best!

10:45.553 --> 10:46.627
(chuckling)

10:46.705 --> 10:48.554
Okay, you're not my couch.

10:48.707 --> 10:50.923
You're not my couch.
I don't know any of you.

10:51.059 --> 10:52.299
Where is the couch?

10:52.319 --> 10:54.301
Welcome
to Joe's Used But Useful.

10:54.379 --> 10:56.470
We're here for
your penny-pinching pleasure.

10:56.490 --> 10:58.548
Hi, I was here this morning.
I dropped off a couch.

10:58.566 --> 11:02.494
Oh, right. You kept saying
someone was going to love you.

11:03.312 --> 11:04.311
Yeah, that didn't pan out.

11:04.331 --> 11:06.164
Um, I need to get it back.

11:06.391 --> 11:08.482
-It's been sold.
-To who?

11:08.502 --> 11:09.483
Oh, I'm sorry,

11:09.503 --> 11:11.244
there are
confidentiality issues.

11:11.338 --> 11:13.004
Why? You're not a doctor.

11:13.231 --> 11:14.731
You sell crap
with weird stains on it.

11:14.733 --> 11:18.251
Sorry, it's really important
that my friend find that couch.

11:18.403 --> 11:19.694
Don't worry, we'll get it back,

11:19.696 --> 11:21.012
and then you can escape from me.

11:21.181 --> 11:22.681
Can we just forget I said that?

11:22.832 --> 11:24.240
Totally forgotten.

11:24.409 --> 11:26.000
And I won't even bring up
the "perky" thing.

11:26.094 --> 11:27.427
But, you know, to be honest,

11:27.521 --> 11:29.003
you're not the easiest person
to live with, either.

11:29.097 --> 11:30.246
I'm sure I'm not.

11:30.265 --> 11:31.247
You're moody in the morning,

11:31.340 --> 11:32.598
you leave dishes in the sink,

11:32.693 --> 11:34.025
you borrow my clothes
without asking.

11:34.252 --> 11:35.585
I have never borrowed
your clothes!

11:35.603 --> 11:38.345
I know! You hate my clothes,
and that's no fun for me!

11:38.440 --> 11:40.532
Well, then, you'll be happy
when I'm gone.

11:40.683 --> 11:43.493
Excuse me, you're making
the customers anxious.

11:49.025 --> 11:50.709
You're making<i> me</i> anxious.

11:50.785 --> 11:54.195
Well, then, just tell us
where the ever-loving couch is.

11:54.289 --> 11:56.864
Fine. But no one can know
where you got the intel.

11:56.958 --> 11:58.699
We promise-- this will
never get traced back to you.

11:58.719 --> 12:00.885
And if it does, we'll just tell
them that we beat it out of you.

12:01.112 --> 12:04.639
It'll be easy to believe because
it was this close to happening.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.209
I'm not sure about this.

12:08.303 --> 12:10.228
-But what's important is we are.
-Mm-hmm.

12:10.379 --> 12:11.621
-I think you're ready to go.
-Mm-hmm.

12:11.639 --> 12:13.732
Yeah, but my feet
aren't even touching the pedals.

12:13.883 --> 12:16.383
This bike was built
for a sporty giant.

12:16.403 --> 12:18.194
Oh. Sorry.

12:18.905 --> 12:20.572
(yells)
Ooh! My boys!

12:20.799 --> 12:22.799
-Ooh, I felt that.
-(high-pitched): Me, too.
-(whimpers)

12:22.892 --> 12:25.410
-(groans)
-All right,
here's what we're gonna do.

12:25.561 --> 12:27.061
-All right?
We're gonna give you a push.
-(grunts)

12:27.080 --> 12:29.897
-Uh, uh...
-Yeah. That's it.
Then you're on your own.

12:29.916 --> 12:31.491
-Wh-What?
-That's not how
we're gonna do this.

12:31.585 --> 12:33.585
Why not?
That's how my dad taught me

12:33.736 --> 12:34.994
and how I taught my son.

12:35.071 --> 12:36.646
You just give 'em a push,
let 'em sink or swim.

12:36.664 --> 12:38.757
Well, I didn't have a dad,
so I can't tap into

12:38.984 --> 12:40.074
all that toxic masculinity.

12:40.243 --> 12:42.076
It's not toxic masculinity!

12:42.170 --> 12:43.653
It's the recipe for a champion!

12:43.746 --> 12:45.671
We're gonna teach Phil the way
that my mom taught me.

12:45.824 --> 12:47.932
She held on and ran behind me
the whole time.

12:48.159 --> 12:50.326
(laughs) That's the stupidest
thing I ever heard.

12:50.419 --> 12:52.011
It was gentle and nurturing.

12:52.163 --> 12:54.755
When did you actually learn
to ride by yourself?

12:54.775 --> 12:56.090
Well, that's not important,
Farter.

12:56.109 --> 12:57.500
Answer the question, son!

12:57.519 --> 12:58.668
Sixth grade, okay?

12:58.686 --> 13:00.003
But it kept my mom
in great shape!

13:00.096 --> 13:01.004
That's why we're doing it
my way,

13:01.097 --> 13:02.839
-pretty boy!
-(yells)

13:02.857 --> 13:04.115
Oh! My foot!

13:04.267 --> 13:05.784
Shake it off, sport.

13:06.011 --> 13:07.285
Oh, my sweet angel.

13:07.454 --> 13:10.997
We had
such different childhoods.

13:15.462 --> 13:17.870
Max was gonna ride me
to urgent care

13:18.023 --> 13:19.280
on the back of his bike,

13:19.299 --> 13:22.449
but your big old chariot
is much nicer.

13:22.469 --> 13:23.709
Happy to help.

13:23.862 --> 13:26.137
You saved me from
my cleaning lady's housewarming.

13:26.289 --> 13:30.683
Somehow, she manages to reach
the dust on<i> her</i> ceiling fan.

13:31.553 --> 13:32.885
How you feeling, Phil?

13:33.054 --> 13:34.871
I feel like a damn fool.

13:34.889 --> 13:37.148
I'm too old
to learn to ride a bike

13:37.300 --> 13:38.983
and too old to find love.

13:39.210 --> 13:42.211
Good Lord, you want
some cheese with that whine?

13:42.213 --> 13:44.397
Hoo-hoo! Sick burn from Sheila.

13:44.549 --> 13:47.733
You know who has a great cheese
and wine pairing? Pete's.

13:47.886 --> 13:49.068
You shut your mouth.

13:49.162 --> 13:50.495
Quiet, you two.

13:50.646 --> 13:53.222
You know, Phil,
when my husband died,

13:53.241 --> 13:55.333
I could've become
a sad old widow,

13:55.560 --> 13:56.726
but I didn't.

13:56.744 --> 13:59.671
I went right next door
and found love again.

13:59.898 --> 14:02.732
I know. My mama says
there's a lid for every pot.

14:02.750 --> 14:04.325
But it's different for gay men.

14:04.344 --> 14:06.177
At some point, the gay lids

14:06.329 --> 14:08.513
want younger, cuter pots
to cover.

14:08.740 --> 14:12.333
And us old pots only get
drug out when the roof leaks.

14:12.410 --> 14:14.744
Oh, please, I'm a woman over 60.

14:14.762 --> 14:16.020
I'm invisible.

14:16.172 --> 14:17.338
When I walk into a room,

14:17.432 --> 14:19.265
all people see is
a great pair of shoes

14:19.417 --> 14:21.860
and a Chanel bag
floating in the air.

14:22.678 --> 14:24.845
I always notice your hair.

14:24.939 --> 14:26.756
Me, too. It's like a penny.

14:26.849 --> 14:28.015
But hair.

14:28.034 --> 14:29.516
Thanks, boys.

14:29.611 --> 14:33.037
Fredrick got me in last minute
before he went into hospice.

14:33.932 --> 14:34.780
You know, Phil,

14:34.933 --> 14:35.990
as I always say,

14:36.042 --> 14:37.375
thank you, next.

14:37.526 --> 14:39.693
(chuckles)
That's Ariana Grande.

14:39.713 --> 14:40.620
That's her song.

14:40.772 --> 14:42.046
Well, I said it first.

14:42.273 --> 14:44.774
Put yourself out there.

14:44.792 --> 14:45.958
And if you get a no,

14:46.111 --> 14:47.944
it's thank you, next.

14:48.037 --> 14:49.721
You want to go out? No?

14:49.872 --> 14:51.372
Thank you, next!

14:51.391 --> 14:53.725
That's some straight up wisdom
right there.

14:53.952 --> 14:55.209
MAX:
Hey,

14:55.228 --> 14:56.285
I know we're on the way
to the hospital,

14:56.304 --> 14:57.395
but we just passed a taco place

14:57.546 --> 14:59.288
with no line
in the drive-through.

14:59.290 --> 15:00.732
What is wrong with you?

15:00.959 --> 15:02.458
-I'm hungry.
-You're always hungry.

15:02.477 --> 15:03.550
Stop shaming me!

15:03.570 --> 15:06.387
So help me,
I will pull this car over.

15:06.481 --> 15:08.055
Can you pull it over
into the parking lot

15:08.133 --> 15:09.815
of that frozen yogurt place?

15:09.968 --> 15:10.967
Ooh, frozen yogurt!

15:10.985 --> 15:13.077
Oh, now you're on board?

15:15.398 --> 15:17.248
I guess, in a way, my mom dying

15:17.417 --> 15:19.900
brought me and my sister
closer together.

15:19.994 --> 15:21.144
There it is.

15:21.312 --> 15:22.569
Okay, here's what we'll do.

15:22.647 --> 15:25.273
I'll pull the fire alarm,
and then we'll rush in.

15:25.275 --> 15:26.649
We'll say
we're with the fire department.

15:26.651 --> 15:27.908
No, that sounds ridiculous.

15:27.928 --> 15:29.318
Let's just wait
until the meeting's over.

15:29.337 --> 15:31.821
W-- That's in an hour
and a half.

15:31.914 --> 15:34.081
I have travel<i> Scrabble</i>
in the car.

15:34.100 --> 15:35.749
Would you two like to join us?

15:35.843 --> 15:38.828
-Oh. Uh, no, no, no.
No, we're-we're good.
-(chuckles softly)

15:38.997 --> 15:39.920
We'll just, uh...

15:39.940 --> 15:41.272
we'll wait out here and watch.

15:41.499 --> 15:43.332
But not in a weird,
like, voyeuristic--

15:43.351 --> 15:46.027
You know, we're firefighters.

15:47.263 --> 15:49.005
You know what? I'll come in.

15:49.023 --> 15:51.324
I've got $2,000 worth of grief.

15:53.011 --> 15:54.677
Good news.

15:54.696 --> 15:56.179
Phil's foot
is just a mild sprain.

15:56.197 --> 15:57.905
Oh, that's a relief.

15:58.016 --> 15:59.198
Now, let's talk about you boys.

15:59.292 --> 16:00.850
What were you thinking?!

16:00.868 --> 16:04.854
Drinking like that and then
putting poor Phil on a bicycle.

16:04.947 --> 16:06.547
-Sorry.
-Sorry.

16:08.209 --> 16:09.968
You know something?
I just realized,

16:10.119 --> 16:11.970
I've never had to do this
before.

16:12.197 --> 16:13.471
The only dangerous thing
Kat ever did

16:13.622 --> 16:17.200
was eat too many breath strips
and her tongue went numb.

16:17.218 --> 16:18.351
We were picking new bourbons

16:18.536 --> 16:20.369
for Carter's bar,
and it got away from us.

16:20.463 --> 16:22.538
Maybe if we would've stuck
to my system...

16:22.707 --> 16:24.557
-Oh, here we go again.
-Let me help.

16:24.709 --> 16:26.300
I'm a bit of an expert.

16:26.319 --> 16:28.987
My mother put bourbon on my gums
when I was teething.

16:29.214 --> 16:30.488
By the time I was two,

16:30.681 --> 16:33.899
I'd developed quite
a distinct palate.

16:33.976 --> 16:35.218
PHIL:
Hey, everybody!

16:35.311 --> 16:36.886
-(chuckles)
-Oh! How are you?

16:36.904 --> 16:37.996
There he is!

16:38.147 --> 16:40.147
(chuckles)
This is Nurse Nelson,

16:40.241 --> 16:41.891
who took very good care of me,

16:41.909 --> 16:44.227
and we're going out on Saturday.

16:44.245 --> 16:46.320
Keep that foot elevated
for a couple days.

16:46.339 --> 16:48.397
-I'll call and check in.
-Mm-hmm.

16:48.416 --> 16:49.415
Mm-hmm.

16:49.509 --> 16:50.508
(chuckling)

16:50.585 --> 16:52.010
Good for you, Phil.

16:52.237 --> 16:53.660
You put yourself out there.

16:53.755 --> 16:55.996
Well, I got a no
from the doctor.

16:56.016 --> 16:58.349
I got a no from the radiologist.

16:58.501 --> 17:00.409
But I kept thank you, next'ing

17:00.428 --> 17:04.247
and thank you, next'ing
until Nelson said

17:04.340 --> 17:06.507
he loves Ariana Grande.

17:06.601 --> 17:10.695
Why is that woman getting credit
for something I came up with?

17:12.440 --> 17:13.847
Like, the other day,

17:13.867 --> 17:18.018
I saw a beautiful butterfly
in my yard and I thought,

17:18.038 --> 17:19.019
"That's Mom,

17:19.039 --> 17:20.854
checking in on me."

17:20.948 --> 17:23.449
She always did have an opinion
about my roses.

17:23.601 --> 17:26.527
It's nice to feel like
she's still with me somehow.

17:26.546 --> 17:29.105
-I know we always...
-Would you mind switching seats?

17:29.198 --> 17:31.274
You get here early,
you get the couch.

17:31.367 --> 17:33.384
Okay.
It's just that my back hurts

17:33.536 --> 17:35.111
when I sit
in these kind of chairs, so...

17:35.204 --> 17:36.537
You get here early,

17:36.556 --> 17:38.598
you get the couch.

17:43.063 --> 17:44.804
Can we just pull
the fire alarm now?

17:44.956 --> 17:46.731
Shh!

17:46.882 --> 17:48.140
Would you like to share?

17:48.234 --> 17:48.974
Me?

17:49.127 --> 17:49.975
Yeah.

17:50.128 --> 17:51.736
Oh. No, no, no.

17:51.887 --> 17:52.719
I'm, uh...

17:52.739 --> 17:55.531
I'm-I'm not sad.
(chuckles)

17:56.634 --> 17:57.967
Today was hard, but...

17:57.985 --> 18:01.304
In general,
I'm a very optimistic person.

18:01.397 --> 18:02.563
(chuckles)

18:03.324 --> 18:05.141
I mean, of course,
there's some sadness.

18:05.310 --> 18:06.976
My-my dad died.

18:06.994 --> 18:10.237
It was over a year ago, but...

18:10.331 --> 18:12.239
still, it's kind of hard
to wrap my head around it.

18:12.333 --> 18:14.241
(exhales) You know?
Like, one day, he was here,

18:14.260 --> 18:15.927
and then, the next day,
he was...

18:16.154 --> 18:17.002
just gone.
(chuckles)

18:17.155 --> 18:19.913
What are you feeling now?

18:19.933 --> 18:22.341
Uh, I don't know.

18:23.103 --> 18:25.678
I guess there's always,
uh, some stuff

18:25.772 --> 18:28.013
that you wish you did or...

18:28.108 --> 18:29.774
got to share.

18:29.925 --> 18:31.834
Mm. Like what?

18:32.595 --> 18:34.670
Well, like,
the weekend before he died,

18:34.763 --> 18:38.116
uh, he cleaned out
the-the closet in the den,

18:38.343 --> 18:39.283
and he found this board game

18:39.510 --> 18:41.527
we used to play,
<i> Hungry Hungry Hippos.</i>

18:41.604 --> 18:43.287
And he asked if I wanted
to come over and play.

18:43.514 --> 18:45.197
You know, he thought it would be
fun if we ordered pizza

18:45.350 --> 18:46.940
and we all played
<i> Hungry Hungry Hippos.</i>

18:47.034 --> 18:49.776
And I said, "I can't play
<i> Hungry Hungry Hippos</i> with you.

18:49.912 --> 18:51.036
"I'm too busy.

18:51.189 --> 18:53.047
Also, I'm almost 40."
(chuckles)

18:55.526 --> 18:58.878
If I had known that he'd be gone
two days later, I mean, I...

18:59.030 --> 19:01.864
I would've played it 100 times.

19:01.883 --> 19:03.457
You know? I would've...

19:03.626 --> 19:06.126
grabbed all the fun
that I could've had with him

19:06.146 --> 19:08.554
out of every moment
that was left.

19:09.632 --> 19:12.208
And maybe that's why I hold on
to people that I love

19:12.226 --> 19:13.634
a little... too tightly.

19:13.653 --> 19:16.821
You know, I just want
to make sure that I, like...

19:16.972 --> 19:19.448
make the most of every moment.

19:20.385 --> 19:22.309
I'm sorry I hurt your feelings.

19:22.328 --> 19:24.904
You know how grateful I am
for you letting me stay.

19:24.998 --> 19:26.889
I do.

19:26.908 --> 19:28.724
And I'll try to be less perky.

19:28.743 --> 19:33.229
No, no. Your perkiness
balances out my anti-perkiness.

19:33.247 --> 19:35.564
Together, we're just
the right amount of perk.

19:36.325 --> 19:38.342
Okay, but I promise--
no more pillow fights.

19:38.494 --> 19:41.161
No, I loved the pillow fight,
because I won.

19:41.239 --> 19:42.405
(chuckles):
Oh.

19:42.423 --> 19:43.848
I let you win.

19:43.999 --> 19:45.850
Bitch, you did not let me win.

19:46.001 --> 19:47.076
Bitch, I did let--

19:47.094 --> 19:49.187
You know,
I cannot pull that off.

19:50.005 --> 19:51.022
Respect for trying though.

19:51.916 --> 19:56.085
I do not like women using
the B-word on each other,

19:56.178 --> 19:57.862
but that was lovely.

19:58.013 --> 19:59.271
(chuckling softly)

19:59.424 --> 20:01.090
(quietly):
Can we pull the fire alarm now?

20:01.108 --> 20:03.275
I've got a better idea.

20:03.428 --> 20:06.621
Um, I don't want to take up
too much time, but...

20:08.190 --> 20:10.115
...would it be possible
to get a group hug?

20:10.268 --> 20:12.526
Of course! Everyone,

20:12.545 --> 20:15.129
let's support our new friend.

20:15.924 --> 20:17.840
Make your move, bitch!

20:18.659 --> 20:19.608
Don't hold this against me!

20:19.627 --> 20:21.302
I might actually come back!

20:22.037 --> 20:24.096
Sorry! Wrong cushion!

20:31.289 --> 20:34.214
Oh, you boys are so sweet
for buying me this.

20:34.234 --> 20:36.976
I'm as happy as a mosquito
at a pool party.

20:37.128 --> 20:39.311
-(chuckling)
-You ready?

20:39.464 --> 20:40.887
-(exhales) I think I am.
-All right,

20:41.056 --> 20:43.148
-remember, buddy, just keep
your eyes straight ahead.
-Okay.

20:43.301 --> 20:44.558
-You can do this, Phil.
-Yeah. (muttering)

20:44.652 --> 20:46.893
One, two. Ready? Go!

20:46.913 --> 20:48.137
-Ooh!
-(chuckles): Oh!

20:48.155 --> 20:49.247
Oh! I'm riding a bike.

20:49.398 --> 20:51.474
I'm riding a bike.
Yep, I'm doing it.

20:51.567 --> 20:52.324
I'm riding a bike.

20:52.418 --> 20:53.918
-(bell tinkles)
-(chuckles)

20:54.145 --> 20:55.327
Aw, the training wheels
were a nice touch.

20:55.421 --> 20:57.755
Did anyone teach him
how to stop?

20:57.924 --> 20:58.814
-(Phil yells)
-(crash)

20:58.983 --> 21:00.073
(gasping)

21:00.167 --> 21:02.468
I'll pull my car around.
