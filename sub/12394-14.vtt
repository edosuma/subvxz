[Christmas music]

00:04.600 --> 00:12.609
*

00:17.210 --> 00:19.610
- K.S.R.P. 23 HAS OBTAINED
THE VIDEO FOOTAGE IN QUESTION

00:19.650 --> 00:22.039
THAT LED TO THE MISTRIAL.

00:22.090 --> 00:23.341
- THANKS FOR THAT REPORT, KATIE.

00:23.390 --> 00:24.687
THE PERSON SEEN IN THE VIDEO

00:24.720 --> 00:26.551
CONDUCTING
THE UNAUTHORIZED SEARCH

00:26.590 --> 00:29.286
IS ONE, SHAWN SPENCER,
A PSYCHIC CONSULTANT

00:29.330 --> 00:31.628
FOR THE SANTA BARBARA
POLICE DEPARTMENT.

00:33.600 --> 00:35.090
- HEY.

00:35.130 --> 00:36.563
HAVE I ALWAYS HAD
THAT DUCKTAIL?

00:36.600 --> 00:38.522
- YOUR MEETING WITH THE CHIEF
STARTS IN 30 MINUTES.

00:38.570 --> 00:40.492
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:40.540 --> 00:42.758
- I'M TRYING TO PERFECT A MOVE
CALLED THE PULL SHOT,

00:42.810 --> 00:44.801
WHICH SHOULD NEVER BE CONFUSED
WITH THE SNAKE.

00:44.840 --> 00:46.501
- CUT THE CRAP, SHAWN.

00:46.540 --> 00:48.235
I TOLD YOU NOT TO GO INTO THAT
BUILDING WITHOUT THE POLICE,

00:48.280 --> 00:50.305
BUT YOU NEVER LISTEN
TO ME, EVER.

00:50.350 --> 00:52.443
NOW THEY LOOK LIKE AMATEURS,
AND PSYCH MIGHT BE FINISHED.

00:52.480 --> 00:55.449
- GUS, DON'T BE THE WAY
ERIQ LA SALLE SPELLS "ERIQ."

00:55.480 --> 00:57.482
YOU KNOW I WOULD NEVER GO
SNOOPING AROUND WILLY-NILLY.

00:57.520 --> 00:58.714
OF COURSE I CHECKED
FOR SECURITY CAMERAS.

00:58.750 --> 01:00.115
THEY MUST'VE BEEN HIDDEN.

01:00.160 --> 01:02.583
- DAMN IT, KAREN!
CZARSKY'S GONNA WALK!

01:02.630 --> 01:04.427
HOW COULD YOU LET THIS HAPPEN?

01:04.460 --> 01:06.553
WE'VE BEEN BUILDING A CASE
AGAINST CZARSKY FOR MONTHS!

01:06.600 --> 01:08.795
- I REALIZE THAT,
DISTRICT ATTORNEY CLARK,

01:08.830 --> 01:11.594
BUT, REMEMBER, IT WAS
MY DETECT IVES WHO GOT YOU

01:11.630 --> 01:13.530
THE EVIDENCE YOU NEEDED TO
PROSECUTE CZARSKY FOR TAX FRAUD

01:13.570 --> 01:14.696
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

01:14.740 --> 01:16.207
- THIS GUY
IS THE KIND OF POND SCUM

01:16.240 --> 01:18.299
THAT INTIMIDATES GOOD,
HARDWORKING PEOPLE

01:18.340 --> 01:19.432
INTO NOT TESTIFYING.

01:19.480 --> 01:20.606
IF I WEREN'T A COP,

01:20.640 --> 01:21.868
I WOULD SHOOT HIM
IN A DARK ALLEY

01:21.910 --> 01:25.698
AND LEAVE EVIDENCE SUGGESTING
HIS OWN PEOPLE WERE BEHIND IT.

01:26.720 --> 01:28.574
AND WHEN I SAY "I,"

01:28.620 --> 01:30.542
I MEAN A FAKE,
IMAGINARY DETECTIVE

01:30.590 --> 01:33.184
TO BE PLAYED BY POWERS BOOTH.

01:33.220 --> 01:35.609
- WELL, NONE OF THAT MATTERS
NOW, BECAUSE YOUR EVIDENCE

01:35.660 --> 01:38.652
WAS OBTAINED BY TRESPASSING
ON CZARSKY'S PROPERTY.

01:38.690 --> 01:40.829
IT'S FRUIT
FROM A POISONOUS TREE,

01:40.860 --> 01:45.797
AND AS A RESULT, JUDGE LELAND
HAS DECLARED A MISTRIAL.

01:45.830 --> 01:47.798
- STOP TRYING TO ACT LIKE
YOU'VE GOT THIS UNDER CONTROL.

01:47.840 --> 01:50.559
I SEE THE EMPTY MONSTER CANS
IN THE WASTE BASKET.

01:50.610 --> 01:52.430
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW TO FIX THIS.

01:52.480 --> 01:54.869
- I WAS UP LATE, BECAUSE
I WAS WATCHING BAD SANTA,

01:54.910 --> 01:56.446
THE UNRATED VERSION.

01:56.480 --> 01:57.777
THEN I WATCHED
THE FIRST AUSTIN POWERS.

01:57.810 --> 02:00.244
THEN I WATCHED BACK-TO-BACK
EPISODES OF JAKE IN PROGRESS,

02:00.280 --> 02:01.645
WHICH IS A MISLEADING TITLE,

02:01.680 --> 02:03.489
'CAUSE JAKE ALWAYS MAKES
THE SAME MISTAKES.

02:03.520 --> 02:05.818
- YOU DO REALIZE THERE'S
NOT EVEN A BALL IN THERE.

02:05.850 --> 02:07.579
- OKAY, I WILL BE
MY CHARMING SELF.

02:07.620 --> 02:09.156
I WILL SMOOTH THINGS OVER
WITH THE CHIEF,

02:09.190 --> 02:11.488
AND EVERYTHING
IS GOING TO BE FINE.

02:11.530 --> 02:13.691
AND THEN WE'LL GO
FOR DILLY BARS.

02:13.730 --> 02:16.267
- YOU HAVE NOBODY TO BLAME
BUT YOURSELVES--

02:16.300 --> 02:18.495
PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES
TO THIS PSYCHIC.

02:18.530 --> 02:19.667
- OKAY.

02:19.700 --> 02:21.258
INSTEAD OF POINTING FINGERS,

02:21.300 --> 02:22.665
LET'S FOCUS ON NEXT STEPS.

02:22.710 --> 02:24.803
- FINE.

02:24.840 --> 02:29.470
I STRONGLY THAT S.B.P.D. TAKE
A LONG LOOK AT THEIR METHODS.

02:29.510 --> 02:31.705
- DULY NOTED.

02:31.750 --> 02:33.240
BUT DO YOU THINK
YOU CAN REFRAIN

02:33.280 --> 02:34.941
FROM MAKING A STATEMENT
JUST LONG ENOUGH

02:34.980 --> 02:37.642
FOR US TO PREPARE
FOR THE MEDIA FIRESTORM

02:37.690 --> 02:40.682
THAT IS ABOUT TO COME DOWN?

02:43.490 --> 02:46.323
WAS A DIRECT RESULT OF A LACK
OF QUALITY CONTROL

02:46.360 --> 02:47.691
AT THE POLICE DEPARTMENT,

02:47.730 --> 02:49.721
SPECIFICALLY
WITH REGARDS TO THEIR USE

02:49.770 --> 02:51.499
OF SPECIAL CONSULTANTS.

02:51.530 --> 02:52.736
[reporters shouting]

02:52.770 --> 02:55.739
- WHAT WILL YOU DO NOW THAT
YOUR CASE HAS BEEN THROWN OUT?

02:55.770 --> 02:58.603
- MY OFFICE, ALONG
WITH S.B.P.D. INTERNAL AFFAIRS,

02:58.640 --> 02:59.971
VOWS TO HOLD EVERYONE INVOLVED

03:00.010 --> 03:03.446
IN THIS BOTCHED INVESTIGATION
ACCOUNTABLE.

03:03.480 --> 03:04.674
NO FURTHER QUESTIONS.

03:04.710 --> 03:05.745
[reporters shouting]

03:05.780 --> 03:09.614
- WHERE THE HELL IS HE, HENRY?

03:09.650 --> 03:11.789
- I'M A PSYCHIC, CHIEF.

03:11.820 --> 03:13.879
YOU KNOW I NEED TO BE
IN THE VICINITY OF OBJECTS

03:13.920 --> 03:15.012
AND THEIR ENERGIES.

03:15.060 --> 03:16.857
I NEED TO PAT THEM, PRICK THEM,
MARK THEM WITH A "B."

03:16.890 --> 03:18.221
THAT'S HOW IT WORKS.

03:18.260 --> 03:19.295
IT'S LIKE THE CHICKEN
AND THE EGG--

03:19.330 --> 03:21.651
MINUS THE EGG, I THINK,
AND POSSIBLY THE CHICKEN.

03:21.700 --> 03:23.258
IF WE HAD WAITED AROUND
FOR A WARRANT,

03:23.300 --> 03:24.562
THIS THING COULD'VE GONE
THE OTHER WAY.

03:24.600 --> 03:25.624
- MR. SPENCER.
- WHOO!

03:25.670 --> 03:27.865
OUR FIRST FIGHT--
I THOUGHT IT WOULD NEVER END.

03:27.900 --> 03:30.562
- SHAWN, SHUT UP.

03:30.610 --> 03:33.272
- I HAVE BEEN GIVEN
AN ULTIMATUM BY THE MAYOR.

03:33.310 --> 03:34.402
AND AS A RESULT,

03:34.440 --> 03:36.340
THE DEPARTMENT HAS DECIDED
TO TAKE PREEMPTIVE ACTION.

03:36.380 --> 03:38.348
- IT'S ABOUT TIME
I WAS ISSUED A WEAPON.

03:38.380 --> 03:40.473
- I'M PLACING YOU
ON SUSPENSION, INDEFINITELY.

03:40.520 --> 03:42.579
- INDEFINITELY?
WELL, MAKE UP YOUR MIND, CHIEF.

03:42.620 --> 03:44.781
AM I SUSPENDED OR NOT?
- YOU MADE YOUR BED, KID.

03:44.820 --> 03:46.754
- I HAVEN'T MADE MY BED
IN 15 YEARS.

03:46.790 --> 03:49.782
- IN ADDITION, INTERNAL AFFAIRS
IS GONNA WANT TO SPEAK WITH YOU,

03:49.830 --> 03:51.422
SO I'D ADVISE YOU NOT
TO LEAVE TOWN.

03:51.460 --> 03:52.722
- I'VE BEEN TELLING YOU
ALL ALONG.

03:52.760 --> 03:54.694
YOUR BLATANT DISREGARD
FOR PROTOCOL,

03:54.730 --> 03:56.561
YOUR RECKLESS POLICE WORK--
IT WAS BOUND TO--

03:56.600 --> 03:58.818
- FURTHERMORE,
I'VE NOTIFIED THE MAYOR

03:58.870 --> 04:00.963
THAT AS A RESULT
OF YOU FAILING

04:01.000 --> 04:03.560
TO CONTROL
YOUR SPECIAL CONSULTANTS,

04:03.610 --> 04:05.259
YOUR POSITION
IS BEING DISSOLVED,

04:05.310 --> 04:07.505
EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY.

04:07.540 --> 04:08.871
- MEANING WHAT, KAREN?

04:08.910 --> 04:10.605
- YOUR SERVICES
ARE NO LONGER REQUIRED.

04:10.650 --> 04:13.744
- WHAT EXACTLY
ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY?

04:13.780 --> 04:16.715
- YOU'RE FIRED, HENRY.

04:18.020 --> 04:19.988
- DAD, YOU ARE OVERREACTING.

04:20.020 --> 04:21.681
THIS KIND OF STUFF HAPPENS
TO ME ALL THE TIME.

04:21.720 --> 04:22.721
GIVE ME A FEW DAYS.

04:22.760 --> 04:24.421
I'LL FIGURE SOMETHING OUT
FOR THE BOTH OF US.

04:24.460 --> 04:25.381
- YEAH, AS USUAL,

04:25.430 --> 04:26.988
ANY SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY
FOR YOUR ACTIONS

04:27.030 --> 04:29.590
IS TOO LI'I'I'LE TOO LATE.

04:29.630 --> 04:32.758
I SIMPLY CANNOT COMPREHEND
HOW YOU CAN BE SO CARELESS,

04:32.800 --> 04:34.631
CONSIDERING
WHO YOUR FATHER IS.

04:34.670 --> 04:35.739
- BEATS ME.

04:35.770 --> 04:36.964
MUST'VE BEEN
ONE OF THOSE LESSONS

04:37.010 --> 04:38.637
YOU NEGLECTED TO TEACH ME
BACK WHEN YOUR JOB

04:38.670 --> 04:40.308
WAS MORE IMPORTANT
THAN YOUR FAMILY.

04:40.340 --> 04:41.876
- HEY, RAISING YOU
WAS NO EASY JOB.

04:41.910 --> 04:46.745
AND IT'S NOT LIKE I HAD
YOUR MOTHER AROUND TO GIVE ME--

04:46.780 --> 04:49.749
SCREW IT.
NAH, IT DOESN'T MATTER.

04:51.690 --> 04:54.579
OH, SHAWN.

04:54.620 --> 04:56.759
AY, YI, YI.

04:56.790 --> 04:58.018
I'M JUST SO TIRED
OF THE GRIND.

04:58.060 --> 05:01.621
YOU AND ME SPINNING OUR WHEELS,
GOING IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS.

05:01.660 --> 05:03.969
I CAN'T HELP BUT WONDER WHAT
OUR LIVES MIGHT'VE BEEN LIKE

05:04.000 --> 05:05.991
IF YOU'D JUST STAYED
WHEREVER THE HELL YOU WERE

05:06.030 --> 05:07.895
AND NOT COME BACK
TO SANTA BARBARA FIVE YEARS AGO.

05:07.940 --> 05:09.737
- WOW.

05:09.770 --> 05:11.465
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

05:11.510 --> 05:15.674

THE NEWS ON A LOOP.

05:50.750 --> 05:54.117

AS BAD PUBLICITY, HUH?

I GET IT.

BECAUSE YOU GOT ME WEARING
A DANCE BELT UP IN HERE, SON.

08:11.990 --> 08:14.857
- OH, SORRY ABOUT THAT.

08:16.790 --> 08:18.052
OH.

08:18.090 --> 08:19.921
- PAUL BUNYAN?
REALLY?

ALL KINDS OF STEREOTYPES HERE.

- POST.

08:27.870 --> 08:30.668
- FORGET YOU.
FIRST STOP IS YOUR DAD'S PLACE.

08:30.710 --> 08:32.598
- I DON'T WANT TO GO THERE.
THIS IS MY DREAM.

08:32.640 --> 08:34.198
- YOUR JOURNEY IS TO SEE
WHAT WOULD'VE HAPPENED

08:34.240 --> 08:35.275
TO THE PEOPLE YOU CARE ABOUT

08:35.310 --> 08:38.108
IF YOU HAD NEVER COME BACK HOME
TO SANTA BARBARA.

THOSE WERE UGLY WORDS.

08:45.250 --> 08:47.855
- WELL, YOU MOSTLY DESERVED IT.
- YOU DESERVED IT.

08:47.890 --> 08:48.959
- SUCK IT.
- YOU SUCK IT.

08:48.990 --> 08:52.892
- JUST FOR THAT,
THERE'S YOUR EXIT, HUH?

08:57.870 --> 09:00.862
- [grunts]

09:06.170 --> 09:08.172
OH, MAN, THAT'S MESSED UP.

09:08.210 --> 09:10.940
- THAT'S WHAT YOU GET
FOR PUTTING ME IN SUSPENDERS.

09:10.980 --> 09:12.345
- WHAT?

09:12.380 --> 09:13.916
WHAT THE--

09:16.690 --> 09:18.681
OH, GOD!

09:18.720 --> 09:21.712
OH, DUDE, IT REEKS IN HERE.
- LIKE BIGFOOT'S ASS.

09:25.990 --> 09:27.855
- OH, MY GOD.

09:27.900 --> 09:30.118
MY DAD TURNED INTO NICK NOLTE.

09:30.170 --> 09:35.039
- [on TV] AND THE THROW COMES
INTO THIRD--

09:35.070 --> 09:36.799
-AH!

09:36.840 --> 09:41.334
- WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
HE BATHED HIMSELF?

09:41.380 --> 09:43.245
- HEY, MADDY, IT'S HENRY.

09:43.280 --> 09:46.772
DON'T YOU THINK MAYBE YOU RUSHED
INTO THIS WEDDING THING?

09:46.820 --> 09:49.243
- WEDDING?

09:49.280 --> 09:50.781
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

09:50.820 --> 09:52.913
MY MOM'S MARRYING
AN AFRICAN PRINCE?

09:52.960 --> 09:54.712
- I WAS JUST SITTING HERE
THINKING ABOUT THAT TIME

09:54.760 --> 09:57.854
I TOOK YOU TO THE CRYSTAL PALACE
OVER IN BAKERSFIELD.

09:57.890 --> 09:59.721
REMEMBER HOW YOU ACCIDENTALLY
KNEED BUCK OWENS

09:59.760 --> 10:01.057
RIGHT IN THE WHOPPERS?

10:01.100 --> 10:02.226
OH, COME ON, MADDY.

10:02.260 --> 10:03.864
MADDY, DON'T GO.

10:03.900 --> 10:06.323
MA_DELIN E?
[dial tone]

10:06.370 --> 10:10.261
[crying]

10:10.310 --> 10:12.801
- MAN HAS TO HAVE SOME RESPECT
FOR HIMSELF. [mutters]

10:16.040 --> 10:17.701
WOW.

10:17.750 --> 10:20.344
HE IS REALLY TAKING THIS HARD.

10:20.380 --> 10:22.348
I GUESS HE WAS DEAD WRONG.

10:22.380 --> 10:24.917
IT'S A GOOD THING
I CAME BACK AFTER ALL.

10:24.950 --> 10:27.714
- YOU DO REALIZE YOU'RE PULLING
ALL THE STRINGS IN THESE DREAMS.

10:27.760 --> 10:29.853
YOU DID THIS TO MAKE YOURSELF
FEEL BETTER.

10:29.890 --> 10:32.188
IT'S EMBARRASSING.
- STOP TRYING TO TWIST THIS.

10:32.230 --> 10:34.926
I CAN'T HELP IT IF MY DAD
IS LOST WITHOUT ME.

10:34.960 --> 10:37.895
WE SHOULD LEAVE NOW...

10:37.930 --> 10:39.864
BEFORE WE'RE EATEN BY FLIES.

10:39.900 --> 10:41.333
WHO'S NEXT?
- IT'S GUS.

10:41.370 --> 10:44.703
HIS OLD LADY HAS A KID
FROM A DIFFERENT BABY DADDY.

10:44.740 --> 10:47.709
HIS ALCOHOLIC MOTHER-IN-LAW
LIVES WITH THEM TOO.

10:47.740 --> 10:50.174
AND I'M PRETTY SURE THEY
LIVE NEXT-DOOR TO EDIE MCCLURG.

10:50.210 --> 10:53.179
- THAT SOUNDS LIKE A U.P.N.
SITCOM FROM THE MID '905.

10:53.220 --> 10:55.848
OOH! OOH-OOH!

10:55.880 --> 10:58.917
CAN WE WATCH GUS' LIFE
LIKE IT WAS A SITCOM?

10:58.950 --> 11:01.783
- IT'S YOUR DREAM.

11:01.820 --> 11:04.983
[comical hip-hop music]

11:05.030 --> 11:13.039
*

11:28.880 --> 11:29.847
[audience cheering]

11:29.890 --> 11:35.283
- [high-pitched]
WHAAAAT?

11:35.320 --> 11:37.356
[laughter]

11:39.230 --> 11:40.822
- GIVE YOUR DADDY A FIST BUMP.

11:40.860 --> 11:43.021
- HE AIN_'T MY DADDY.
[audience ohs]

11:43.070 --> 11:45.459
- WHAT'S HAPPENIN', ANFERNEE?

11:45.500 --> 11:48.765
- YOU AIN'T MY DADDY.

11:48.800 --> 11:50.336
- IS THAT ALL HE SAYS?

11:50.370 --> 11:51.803
- THIS SEASON.

11:51.840 --> 11:54.479
LAST YEAR
IT WAS "SNIFF THIS, EUNUCH!"

11:54.510 --> 11:56.808
both: MMM.

11:56.850 --> 11:59.045
- THAT'S
SOME SWEET SUGAR, BURTON.

11:59.080 --> 12:02.243
- SUGAR DANCE!

12:10.030 --> 12:13.488
- WOW. YOU REALLY DO THAT
TO YOUR BOY?

12:13.530 --> 12:15.498
- WHAT, TO SITCOM GUS?
ABSOLUTELY.

12:15.530 --> 12:16.861
THIS IS BRILLIANT.

12:18.900 --> 12:19.696
- [sighs]

12:19.730 --> 12:21.937
- SO HOW WAS
YOUR DAY TODAY, WIFE?

12:21.970 --> 12:24.859
- OH, YOU KNOW MY COUSIN
SH'REETHRA FROM THE CITY?

12:24.910 --> 12:27.231
WELL, SHE MOVED IN
WITH US TODAY.

12:27.280 --> 12:29.407
OH, AND ANFERNEE LEARNED
THAT DRUGS ARE FOR THUGS.

12:29.440 --> 12:31.340
- HE AIN'T MY DADDY.

12:31.380 --> 12:33.041
- HERE'S THE WEIRD THING.

12:33.080 --> 12:34.377
I THINK THIS IS A RERUN.

12:34.420 --> 12:36.172
- OKAY, NOW IT'S TIME
FOR US TO GO.

12:36.220 --> 12:37.778
WE'VE ALREADY EATEN.

12:37.820 --> 12:39.981
I THINK THERE'S SOME CEREAL
IN THE PANTRY.

12:40.020 --> 12:42.159
OH, AND, BABE,
WOULD YOU MIND TAKING A LOOK

12:42.190 --> 12:44.488
AT THOSE CREDIT-CARD BILLS
AND PAYING THEM?

12:44.530 --> 12:46.327
THANK YOU.
MWAH!

12:46.360 --> 12:49.056
OH! TIME TO GET OUR FIT ON.
LET'S GO.

12:49.100 --> 12:50.795
[audience cheering]

12:50.830 --> 12:54.539
- STILL AIN'T MY DADDY.

12:54.570 --> 12:57.459
- A SPOKESPERSON
FOR THE S.B.P.D. FOUND IT ODD

12:57.510 --> 12:59.876
THAT THE SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE
WASN'T SUBMITTED EARLIER

12:59.910 --> 13:01.969
IN THE PROCEEDINGS.

13:02.010 --> 13:04.046
- WAIT, WHY DOES SHE SOUND LIKE
A NEWS REPORTER ALL OF A SUDDEN?

13:04.080 --> 13:06.446
- YOU LEI-T THE TV ON,
REMEMBER?

13:06.480 --> 13:08.846
- OH, YEAH, LOOK AT THAT.

13:10.590 --> 13:12.478
- [grunts, panting]

13:12.520 --> 13:14.215
- WOW.

13:14.260 --> 13:15.909
THIS IS REALLY HORRIBLE.

13:15.960 --> 13:18.087
GUS IS SO UNDERAPPRECIATED
AROUND HERE.

13:18.130 --> 13:19.995
- BINGO.
NOW YOU'RE GETTING IT.

13:20.030 --> 13:22.453
YOUR IMAGINATION IS DARK
AND RIDICULOUS,

13:22.500 --> 13:25.162
BUT AT LEAST THE MESSAGE
IS BURIED IN THERE SOMEWHERE.

13:25.200 --> 13:26.599
- OH, YOU MEAN THAT EVERYONE
WOULD BE MISERABLE

13:26.630 --> 13:28.097
IF I HADN'T COME BACK
TO SANTA BARBARA?

13:28.140 --> 13:29.334
I COULD'VE TOLD YOU THAT.

13:29.370 --> 13:31.964
- BOY, ARE YOU IN
FOR A SURPRISE.

13:32.010 --> 13:33.602
- MAN, YOU CAN'T JUST SAY
I'M IN FOR A SURPRISE

13:33.640 --> 13:35.130
AND THEN EAT A GINGERSNAP.

13:35.180 --> 13:36.602
- I CAN DO ANYTHING I WANT.

13:36.640 --> 13:38.244
- SO NOW WHAT?

13:38.280 --> 13:41.841
- WAIT FOR IIIIT!

13:41.880 --> 13:45.008
[gate opening]

13:47.520 --> 13:49.010
TOLD YOU.

13:56.330 --> 13:58.321
- WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

14:00.340 --> 14:03.002
- [German accent]
HALT!

14:06.570 --> 14:08.879
- [German accent]
HALT!

14:12.650 --> 14:14.208
DON'T MOVE!

14:14.250 --> 14:17.287
DON'T BREATHE.
DON'T THINK.

14:17.320 --> 14:21.211
ZE CHIEF WISHES TO SPEAK.

14:21.260 --> 14:23.228
- WHY DOES SHE FAKE HAVE
A GERMAN ACCENT?

14:23.260 --> 14:25.228
- BECAUSE WE WATCHED
AUSTIN POWERS LAST NIGHT,

14:25.260 --> 14:27.626
AND YOU HAVE A THING
FOR FRAU FARBISSINA.

14:27.660 --> 14:31.221
AND NOW SO DO I.

14:39.140 --> 14:41.028
- THANK YOU, FRAU VICK.

14:41.080 --> 14:43.071
[loud smack]
- OW!

14:43.110 --> 14:46.102
- GENTLEMEN...

14:46.150 --> 14:49.176
I WILL NOT MINCE WORDS.

14:49.220 --> 14:51.484
IT HAS BEEN BROUGHT
TO MY ATTENTION

14:51.520 --> 14:55.616
THAT ONLY 31%
OF ARRESTED ASSAILANTS

14:55.660 --> 14:59.289
HAVE SUSTAINED GUNSHOT WOUNDS.

14:59.330 --> 15:01.696
NOW, THIS,
I'M SURE YOU ALL REALIZE,

15:01.730 --> 15:03.368
IS ENTIRELY UNACCEPTABLE!

15:03.400 --> 15:05.163
- UNACCEPTABLE!

15:05.200 --> 15:07.293
- WE DO NOT PROVIDE YOU

15:07.340 --> 15:10.138
WITH THE HEAW FIREARMS
YOU WEAR NEAR YOUR HEARTS

15:10.170 --> 15:12.263
AND THE ENDLESS AMMUNITION

15:12.310 --> 15:15.199
SO THAT
YOU CAN FINESSE JUSTICE,

15:15.240 --> 15:17.140
DO WE,
JUNIOR DETECTIVE MCNAB?

15:17.180 --> 15:18.477
- NO, SIR!

15:18.510 --> 15:20.978
YOU GIVE THEM TO US
SO WE CAN SHOOT CRIMINALS.

15:21.020 --> 15:23.386
- AS YOU WERE.

15:26.620 --> 15:28.986
- IT IS BELIEVED CZARSKY
HAS INTEREST

15:29.020 --> 15:31.523
IN SEVERAL SMALL BUSINESSES
ON SANTA BARBARA'S WEST SIDE,

15:31.560 --> 15:34.620
THOUGH HIS AFFILIATIONS
REMAIN UNCONFIRMED.

15:36.660 --> 15:40.369
- SO BECAUSE I NEVER CAME BACK,
SHE ENDS UP GETTING DEMOTED,

15:40.400 --> 15:43.039
AND LASSIE ENDS UP
WITH HIS DREAM JOB.

15:48.540 --> 15:50.098
AT LEAST THEY RESPECT HIM.

15:54.180 --> 15:56.045
[sighs]

15:56.080 --> 15:58.116
OH, POOR MCNAB.

15:58.150 --> 15:59.344
- SO, YOU SEE,

15:59.390 --> 16:01.085
NOT EVERYBODY'S WORSE OFF
WITHOUT YOU.

16:01.120 --> 16:04.021
- ALL THE MORE REASON
I NEEDED TO COME HOME.

16:04.060 --> 16:07.257
I'M A SAVIOR.
I SAVED THE S.B.P.D.

16:07.300 --> 16:09.222
- WOW, YOU'RE SO INSECURE.

16:09.260 --> 16:11.990
- WAIT A MINUTE.

16:12.030 --> 16:13.429
WHERE'S JULES?

16:13.470 --> 16:16.030
- UH, YOU WEREN'T HERE
TO OUT LASSITER'S SECRET TRYST

16:16.070 --> 16:17.162
WITH HIS OLD PARTNER.

16:17.210 --> 16:18.336
SO THE TIMING DIDN'T WORK OUT

16:18.370 --> 16:20.201
FOR HER TRANSFER
TO SANTA BARBARA.

16:20.240 --> 16:22.128
- WHAT, SHE'S STILL IN MIAMI?

16:22.180 --> 16:24.501
WELL, LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.
WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR?

16:24.550 --> 16:26.279
- YOU MIGHT WANT TO SIT DOWN.

16:29.680 --> 16:32.046
- AH.

16:32.090 --> 16:34.115
WHAT ABOUT YOU?
- BYE-BYE.

16:47.670 --> 16:48.637
- WHOA.

16:48.670 --> 16:50.137
[tires squealing]

16:50.170 --> 16:54.129
- [screaming]

16:56.080 --> 16:57.775
WE HAVE NO BACKUP.
THEY HAVE HEAW ARTILLERY.

16:57.810 --> 16:59.368
- WE CALLED FOR BACKUP,
BACHYNSKY.

16:59.410 --> 17:01.139
IF WE LOSE THEM,
WE HAVE NOTHING TO BACK UP.

17:01.180 --> 17:02.442
IT ALSO MEANS WE SUCK.

17:02.480 --> 17:04.186
JULES, THIS IS SO HOT.

17:04.220 --> 17:06.085
YOU'RE LIKE HEATHER LOCKLEAR
IN T.J. HOOKER,

17:06.120 --> 17:08.213
WHICH MEANS HE'S ADRIAN ZMED.

17:08.260 --> 17:11.252
WAIT A MINUTE.
ARE YOU DATING DWYANE WADE?

17:11.290 --> 17:13.394
THAT DOESN'T EVEN MAKE SENSE.
HE'S WITH GABRIELLE UNION.

17:13.430 --> 17:15.489
- ALL UNITS, ALL UNITS!

17:15.530 --> 17:17.088
WE ARE ABOUT TO ENGAGE
IN A SUICIDE MISSION.

17:17.130 --> 17:19.428
PLEASE COME AND SAVE ME.

17:19.470 --> 17:22.359
[tires squealing]

17:23.540 --> 17:26.304
[all screaming]

17:33.580 --> 17:36.469
[siren wailing]

17:36.520 --> 17:40.286
- AAH!
AAH-HA-HA!

17:42.290 --> 17:45.384
[heavy gunfire]
- WHOA!

17:47.260 --> 17:50.263
[gunfire continues]

17:52.200 --> 17:53.189
AAH!

17:58.240 --> 18:01.232
[all screaming]

18:07.150 --> 18:10.711
- [wailing]

18:11.820 --> 18:14.812
[screaming stops,
ethereal music]

18:17.860 --> 18:20.897
[screaming continues]

18:20.930 --> 18:22.158
[screaming stops]

18:22.200 --> 18:23.269
- COVER ME!

18:23.300 --> 18:25.188
- NO WAY!
I'M GOING FETAL!

18:25.230 --> 18:28.290
- [grunting]

18:28.340 --> 18:31.400
[heavy gunfire]

18:34.410 --> 18:36.173
ORALE! ORALE!

18:36.210 --> 18:39.646
- VIVA CUBA!
- COME ON! HA HA!

18:39.680 --> 18:41.443
-AH!

18:44.520 --> 18:47.455
[distant sirens wailing]

18:56.930 --> 18:58.591
- DAMN IT!

18:58.630 --> 19:01.497
OH, WHAT WERE YOU GUYS WAITING
FOR--CANADIAN THANKSGIVING?

19:01.540 --> 19:03.735
UP THE FIRE ESCAPE!
GO! GO!

19:07.680 --> 19:09.204
- HEY, WHY--WHY COULDN'T
WE JUST LET 'EM GO?

19:09.240 --> 19:10.673
- BECAUSE
THEY'RE VIOLENT CRIMINALS,

19:10.710 --> 19:11.802
AND THEY SMUGGLED
THOSE CIGARS.

19:11.850 --> 19:13.909
- YOU KNOW WHAT? I DON'T THINK
I'M CUT OUT FOR THIS.

19:13.950 --> 19:16.441
I NEED TO TRANSFER
TO SOMEWHERE LIKE SANTA BARBARA.

19:16.480 --> 19:18.186
- OH, THAT'D BE NICE.

19:18.220 --> 19:21.257
I'D PROBABLY BE
A DETECTIVE BY NOW.

19:21.290 --> 19:22.917
- AUTHORITIES HAVE LONG SINCE
BEEN INVESTIGATING

19:22.960 --> 19:25.724
CZARSKY'S TIES
TO THE MIAMI-DADE COUNTY AREA.

19:25.760 --> 19:29.218
AND NOW SPORTS
WITH COLLIN HILLIS.

19:29.260 --> 19:31.626
- WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO YOU?
YOU MISSED ALL THE ACTION.

19:31.670 --> 19:33.194
- ALL I MISSED
WAS GETTING TOSSED AROUND

19:33.240 --> 19:34.468
LIKE A BLACK LOTTO BALL.

19:34.500 --> 19:36.866
- THAT AND JULIET
ALMOST GETTING KILLED...

19:36.900 --> 19:38.709
UP HERE IN THE 'HOOD.

19:38.740 --> 19:40.674
SHE'S VERY LUCKY I CAME BACK.

19:40.710 --> 19:42.473
I HAD NO IDEA
WHAT A MAJOR ROLE I PLAYED

19:42.510 --> 19:43.807
IN HER CAREER DEVELOPMENT.

19:43.850 --> 19:45.909
- HOW MUCH LONGER
YOU GONNA STAY IN DENIAL, HUH?

19:45.950 --> 19:47.474
- HOW MUCH MORE TIME
DO WE HAVE?

19:47.520 --> 19:48.373
- GET OUT OF THE CAR.

19:48.420 --> 19:50.911
- CAN I BE PERFECTLY HONEST
WITH YOU?

19:50.950 --> 19:53.783
I CAN'T FEEL ANYTHING
BELOW MY CHIN.

20:02.930 --> 20:05.398
OH, NO.
GUS IS MELTING.

20:05.430 --> 20:06.658
I NEED TO WAKE UP.

20:06.700 --> 20:07.962
- NOT UNTIL YOU LEARN
YOUR LESSON.

20:08.000 --> 20:08.898
- I DID.

20:08.940 --> 20:10.965
I LEARNED HOW IMPORTANT I AM
TO EVERYONE.

20:11.010 --> 20:11.863
- THIS ISN'T ABOUT THEM.

20:11.910 --> 20:13.673
HAVEN'T YOU SEEN
IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE?

20:13.710 --> 20:15.234
- NO. I CAN'T DO
BLACK AND WHITE.

20:15.280 --> 20:16.474
- HOW ABOUT A CHRISTMAS CAROL?

20:16.510 --> 20:17.841
- I CAN'T DO SUBTITLES.

20:17.880 --> 20:19.541
YOU KNOW VEILllé-r I DID SEE--

20:19.580 --> 20:20.911
HOW COME YOU'RE NOT
IN THAT MOVIE?

20:20.950 --> 20:22.019
- IT'S NOT ABOUT ME
AND WHICH ROLES

20:22.050 --> 20:23.847
I SHOULD'VE GOTTEN
OVER DINKLAGE.

20:23.890 --> 20:25.448
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU WOULD BE DOING

20:25.490 --> 20:27.253
IF YOU HADN'T COME BACK HOME,
SHAWN, HUH?

20:27.290 --> 20:28.917
WORKING THE WEINERMOBILE
IN MADISON

20:28.960 --> 20:30.689
OR GIVING TOURS AT GRACELAND?

20:30.730 --> 20:32.925
- HEY, ELVIS HAS
HIS OWN RACQUETBALL COURT.

20:32.960 --> 20:33.995
THOSE JOBS WERE FUN.

20:34.030 --> 20:35.554
IT WAS JUST YOU
BOUNCING AROUND

20:35.600 --> 20:37.761
AVOIDING RESPONSIBILITY
AND EMOTIONAL COMMITMENT.

20:37.800 --> 20:39.688
I MEAN, SURE IT WAS FUN
BACK THEN.

20:39.730 --> 20:40.765
YOU WERE A KID.

20:40.800 --> 20:42.028
IT'S TIME TO GROW UP,

20:42.070 --> 20:44.868
OR YOU'RE GONNA LOSE THE PEOPLE
THAT CARE ABOUT YOU THE MOST.

20:44.910 --> 20:47.333
-IAM?

20:48.710 --> 20:51.372
I GUESS I COULD AFFORD TO MAKE
A STRIDE OR TWO.

20:51.410 --> 20:52.479
- YEAH, YOU COULD.

20:52.510 --> 20:54.011
- HEY!

20:54.050 --> 20:55.915
DON'T GIVE IN TO HIM,
YOU SELL-OUT.

20:55.950 --> 20:57.508
WHERE THE HELL
DID YOU COME FROM?

20:57.550 --> 20:58.983
- YOUR BUTT.
- WHO IS THIS?

20:59.020 --> 21:01.011
- US...
AS A KID.

21:01.060 --> 21:03.016
- DOESN'T LOOK LIKE US
AS A KID.

21:03.060 --> 21:04.687
- WELL, WE CHANGED...

21:04.730 --> 21:06.322
SOMETIMES
FROM WEEK TO WEEK, HUH?

21:06.360 --> 21:07.429
- THAT'S TRUE.

21:07.460 --> 21:08.950
- WE MADE A DEAL
TO NEVER GROW UP.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.389
AND I HELD UP MY END
LIKE A CHAMPION.

21:11.430 --> 21:12.727
- I KNOW YOU DID,
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

21:12.770 --> 21:14.533
IT WAS EASIER FOR YOU.

21:14.570 --> 21:16.492
IT'S--IT'S ACCEPTABLE
TO ACT LIKE A 12-YEAR-OLD

21:16.540 --> 21:18.360
WHEN YOU'RE ACTUALLY
A 12-YEAR-OLD.

21:18.410 --> 21:20.378
- WELL, YOU WERE DOING
JUST FINE, TOO,

21:20.410 --> 21:23.345
UNTIL LITTLE FRODO JENKINS HERE
CAME ALONG.

21:23.380 --> 21:26.042
- DUDE, I WILL LAY HIM OUT.
- HE DIDN'T MEAN THAT.

21:26.080 --> 21:27.718
- UH, YES, I DID.

21:27.750 --> 21:30.583
DUDE, HE'S RIPPING US APART.

21:30.620 --> 21:32.383
- HE'S SO DRAMATIC.

21:32.420 --> 21:34.388
GO TO YOUR ROOM,
OR...

21:34.420 --> 21:36.388
DO WHATEVER YOU WANT. GO!

21:36.420 --> 21:39.457
YOU'RE FREAKING ME OUT! GO!

21:41.700 --> 21:43.565
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO KILL
YOUR INNER CHILD.

21:43.600 --> 21:45.921
JUST TAKE RESPONSIBILITY
FOR YOUR DECISIONS

21:45.970 --> 21:48.768
AND THE WAY THEY AFFECT OTHERS,
YOU MUTTON HEAD.

21:48.800 --> 21:50.802
- HEY, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE
A LITTLE BASTARD.

21:50.840 --> 21:51.966
- YES, I DO.

21:52.010 --> 21:54.001
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY I CAN
PENETRATE YOUR THICK SKULL.

21:54.040 --> 21:55.109
- I THINK I GOT IT.
I-I REALLY DO.

21:55.140 --> 21:56.778
- IT'S ABOUT DAMN TIME.

21:56.810 --> 21:58.949
LOOK, IT'S A SNOW BUNNY.
- WHERE?

22:01.150 --> 22:04.586
HEY, THERE'S NO--

22:04.620 --> 22:06.087
YOU DON'T MIND THE OX, COX.

22:06.120 --> 22:08.918
- COME ON, BABE.

22:10.490 --> 22:12.026
- DON'T BE A STRANGER.

22:12.060 --> 22:14.927
I'M KIDDING.
BE A STRANGER.

22:23.040 --> 22:26.100
AHH.

22:39.420 --> 22:41.058
I WAS RIGHT
ABOUT THOSE CAMERAS.

22:41.090 --> 22:42.182
THERE WEREN'T ANY.

22:42.220 --> 22:46.554
THAT SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE
WAS SHOT FROM THE OUTSIDE.

22:46.590 --> 22:48.751
WHO AM I TALKING TO?

22:50.900 --> 22:54.392
OH, BROWN SNOWMAN GUS...

22:54.440 --> 22:58.604
I THINK I'LL MISS YOU
MOST OF ALL.

23:11.890 --> 23:14.688
- HEY!

23:17.060 --> 23:18.186
- THANK YOU.

23:18.230 --> 23:19.379
NOW, SHAWN, MAKE THIS QUICK.

23:19.430 --> 23:21.853
I HAD TO PICK UP TWO EXTRA
ROUTES NOW THAT WE'RE SUSPENDED.

23:21.900 --> 23:23.492
MY CASE WEIGHS OVER 60 POUNDS.

23:23.530 --> 23:27.569
- GUS, THE LIGHTBULB CAME ON.
I'VE HAD A CATHETER.

23:27.600 --> 23:29.192
- CATHARSIS?

23:29.240 --> 23:31.128
- YOU ARE MY BIG, SWEET,
BROWN ROCK,

23:31.170 --> 23:32.808
AND YOU ALWAYS HAVE BEEN.

23:32.840 --> 23:34.137
- I'M NOT GIVING YOU
ANY MONEY, SHAWN.

23:34.180 --> 23:35.033
- NO, NO, NO.

23:35.080 --> 23:37.139
I SHOULD'VE LISTENED TO YOU.
I'M SORRY.

23:37.180 --> 23:39.171
OF ALL THE RELATIONSHIPS
IN MY LIFE,

23:39.210 --> 23:40.541
OURS IS EASILY THE MOST STABLE

23:40.580 --> 23:42.013
AND THE ONLY ONE
I HAVEN'T SCREWED UP.

23:42.050 --> 23:43.642
IF I HADN'T COME BACK
TO SANTA BARBARA,

23:43.690 --> 23:45.009
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'D BE DOING,

23:45.050 --> 23:46.586
BUT WHEREVER I WAS,
I'D BE WISHING I HAD YOU THERE

23:46.620 --> 23:47.814
TO LEAN ON,

23:47.860 --> 23:49.680
JUST LIKE THE FIRST TIME I GOT
KICKED OUT OF LITTLE LEAGUE

23:49.720 --> 23:51.119
FOR CORKING MY BATS,

23:51.160 --> 23:52.582
JUST LIKE I AM NOW.

23:52.630 --> 23:55.121
I NEED YOU TO HELP ME
OUT OF THIS MESS, BUDDY.

23:55.160 --> 23:58.163
- SHAWN, LOOK, YOU'RE MY BOY.

23:58.200 --> 23:59.292
AND IF YOU HADN'T COME BACK,

23:59.330 --> 24:02.128
I'D PROBABLY BE MARRIED
TO SOME KIND OF MATERIAL GIRL

24:02.170 --> 24:04.206
AND PLAYING IN A MEN'S OVER-30
DODGEBALL LEAGUE.

24:04.240 --> 24:06.504
- THEY HAVE THOSE?
- OF COURSE THEY DO.

24:06.540 --> 24:08.508
AND LOOK, I'M GLAD YOU FOUND
YOUR CLARITY,

24:08.540 --> 24:09.609
BUT I DON'T THINK
THERE'S ANY WAY

24:09.640 --> 24:10.868
TO POSSIBLY GET
OUT OF THIS ONE.

24:10.910 --> 24:13.140
- I HAVE TWO BACKSTAGE PASSES
TO RALPH TRESVANT NEXT WEEKEND

24:13.180 --> 24:15.512
THAT SAYS THERE IS.
- YES, WE CAN.

24:15.550 --> 24:17.541
WHAT DO WE GOT?
- STEALTH MODE.

24:19.250 --> 24:22.048
SEE, I HAD TO GO TO SLEEP
AND DREAM

24:22.090 --> 24:23.523
IN ORDER TO THINK STRAIGHT.

24:23.560 --> 24:24.527
BUT I WAS RIGHT.

24:24.560 --> 24:27.051
THERE WERE NO SECURITY CAMERAS
IN THAT ROOM.

24:27.090 --> 24:29.695
- SO HOW DID CZARSKY'S DEFENSE
GET THAT FOOTAGE OF YOU?

24:29.730 --> 24:32.563
- SHOT THROUGH A WINDOW.
- FROM THE OUTSIDE?

24:32.600 --> 24:35.239
- FROM THE ANGLE
OF THE VIDEO...

24:35.270 --> 24:37.636
THEIR SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE
WAS SHOT

24:37.670 --> 24:39.206
FROM THAT WINDOW OVER THERE.

24:42.240 --> 24:44.049
- WAIT A SECOND.
[sniffing]

24:44.080 --> 24:45.104
DO YOU SMELL THAT?

24:45.150 --> 24:47.243
- I ATE A BRAN MUFFIN.
I NEEDED SOMETHING QUICK.

24:47.280 --> 24:49.271
- I'M TALKING ABOUT INSIDE
THERE, SHAWN.

24:49.320 --> 24:52.244
WHATEVER IT IS,
IT'S PETROLEUM BASED.

24:52.290 --> 24:54.986
- HMM. WHERE DO YOU THINK
THE SUPER SNIFFER RANKS

24:55.020 --> 24:56.248
AMONG OTHER HEROES' POWERS?

24:56.290 --> 24:58.053
- BELOW X-RAY VISION
AND WEATHER CONTROL,

24:58.090 --> 24:59.728
BUT DEFINITELY BETTER
THAN ANYTHING ROBIN

24:59.760 --> 25:00.795
BRINGS TO THE TABLE.

25:00.830 --> 25:02.058
- WHICH IS NOTHING.
- EXACTLY.

25:02.100 --> 25:04.489
- HE'S A LIABILITY.
- S0 IS BATGIRL.

25:10.610 --> 25:12.259
- WHOEVER LIVES HERE IS HOME

25:12.310 --> 25:15.677
AND DOES NOT WANT
TO BE DISTURBED.

25:15.710 --> 25:17.803
- CENSUS BUREAU.

25:17.850 --> 25:20.239
SO WHAT'S OUR MOVE?

25:24.590 --> 25:25.739
- BRACE YOURSELF, GUS.

25:25.790 --> 25:27.246
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PLAY
BY THE BOOK.

25:27.290 --> 25:29.918
IT'LL BE DIFFICULT, BUT
I'M GONNA HELP YOU THROUGH IT.

25:29.960 --> 25:33.225
- I ALWAYS PLAY BY THE BOOK.
- I KNOW.

25:33.260 --> 25:35.922
WE ARE GONNA USE
IMPULSE CONTROL,

25:35.960 --> 25:38.690
WHICH IS THE PRACTICE
OF CONTROLLING ONE'S IMPULSES.

25:38.730 --> 25:41.290
FOR INSTANCE, I LOOK DOWN
AND SEE THAT ROACH THERE,

25:41.340 --> 25:43.069
AND I TELL MYSELF,
"I CAN'T EAT THAT."

25:43.100 --> 25:44.601
- DO I NEED TO SLAP YOU
IN THE FACE?

25:44.640 --> 25:45.800
- LET'S FOCUS.

25:45.840 --> 25:47.330
WE'RE GONNA BRING THE POLICE IN
ON THIS LEAD

25:47.370 --> 25:50.100
BEFORE WE DO ANYTHING ELSE.

25:50.140 --> 25:52.074
- WHAT ARE YOU STARING AT?

25:52.110 --> 25:53.577
- I'M TELLING MYSELF...

25:53.620 --> 25:57.841
I CAN'T SQUEEZE
YOUR SWEET, SWEET HEAD.

25:57.890 --> 26:01.087
- ALL RIGHT, DOBSON.
IT WAS WORTH A SHOT.

26:01.120 --> 26:02.052
- LASSIE?

26:02.090 --> 26:04.729
I KNOW--I KNOW I AM
THE LAST PERSON ON EARTH

26:04.760 --> 26:06.955
THAT YOU WANT TO SEE RIGHT NOW,
BUT I BROUGHT YOU SOMETHING.

26:06.990 --> 26:09.049
WHERE'S JULES?

26:09.100 --> 26:10.761
- IF YOU MUST KNOW,
SHE'S OUT TRYING TO FIND

26:10.800 --> 26:12.688
A NEW LEAD
ON THE CZARSKY CASE.

26:12.730 --> 26:14.266
CLEANING UP YOUR MESS
OF EPIC PROPORTIONS

26:14.300 --> 26:16.097
HAS BEEN TAKING ITS TOLL
ON EVERYONE.

26:16.140 --> 26:18.108
AND WHILE I USUALLY HAVE
NO TIME FOR YOU,

26:18.140 --> 26:20.301
TODAY I ACTUALLY HAVE
LESS THAN NO TIME FOR YOU.

26:20.340 --> 26:21.272
- LASSIE, LISTEN,

26:21.310 --> 26:23.904
IT'S NO SECRET
THAT WE'VE HAD OUR BEEFS...

26:23.950 --> 26:25.838
OUR RIl-TS, OUR...
- STATIC.

26:25.880 --> 26:27.370
- IN THE PAST,
BUT I HAVE RECENTLY TAKEN

26:27.410 --> 26:29.071
A LONG LOOK AT THE MAN
IN THE MIRROR.

26:29.120 --> 26:30.075
- * HEE HEE

26:30.120 --> 26:31.382
- WHAT I DISCOVERED WAS...

26:31.420 --> 26:33.240
IN SPITE OF ALWAYS GIVING YOU
SUCH A HARD TIME

26:33.290 --> 26:36.612
ABOUT BEING TOO UPTIGHT,
TOO RIGID,

26:36.660 --> 26:39.185
THE TRUTH IS I COULD'VE GOTTEN
A LOT FURTHER IN MY OWN LIFE

26:39.230 --> 26:41.994
IF I HAD EVEN HALF
OF YOUR DISCIPLINE.

26:42.030 --> 26:45.090
- AND POSTURE.
- SURE.

26:45.130 --> 26:47.189
- AND THE STERN BUSH.
- ABSOLUTELY.

26:47.230 --> 26:48.390
- AND MY
PURSUIT-DRIVING ABILITY.

26:48.440 --> 26:52.035
- IF YOU NEED TO HEAR THAT,
THEN, YES.

26:52.070 --> 26:54.174
NOW, COME ON,
LET'S HUG IT OUT.

26:54.210 --> 26:56.770
- I WOULD RATHER FALL IN LOVE
WITH A VEGAN.

26:56.810 --> 26:57.708
- THAT'S FAIR.

26:57.750 --> 26:59.945
- LOOK, THIS LACK OF ANIMOSITY
BETWEEN US

26:59.980 --> 27:01.413
IS KIND OF FREAKING ME OUT
RIGHT NOW.

27:01.450 --> 27:03.270
- I'VE HAD A PSYCHIC VISION
ABOUT A LOCATION

27:03.320 --> 27:05.288
THAT MAY YIELD NEW EVIDENCE
IN THE CZARSKY CASE.

27:05.320 --> 27:07.083
- SPENCER, YOU'RE ON SUSPENSION,
AND, TECHNICALLY,

27:07.120 --> 27:08.382
I SHOULDN'T EVEN BE TALKING
TO YOU RIGHT NOW.

27:08.420 --> 27:10.308
- ALL WE'RE GONNA DO
IS TAKE A DRIVE.

27:10.360 --> 27:12.783
ONCE WE GET THERE,
WE WILL DO EVERYTHING YOUR WAY.

27:12.830 --> 27:16.129
- THAT'S IF YOU STILL WANT
TO CATCH THIS BASTARD.

27:16.160 --> 27:17.297
- I'LL DRIVE.

27:25.470 --> 27:27.938
AND I'M SENSING
THAT NOBODY'S HOME.

27:27.980 --> 27:31.347
- S.B.P.D.!
[door slams]

27:31.380 --> 27:33.871
- WHAT IS THAT ODOR?
- [sniffs]

27:33.920 --> 27:35.239
WHATEVER IT IS,
IT'S FLAMMABLE,

27:35.280 --> 27:37.316
WHICH IS SOMETHING
I LIKE TO CALL...

27:37.350 --> 27:38.339
CAUSE.

27:45.330 --> 27:46.422
- THIS IS IT.

27:46.460 --> 27:49.099
THIS IS WHERE THE SURVEILLANCE
FOOTAGE WAS SHOT FROM.

27:49.130 --> 27:52.896
- YOU STAY HERE
TILL I CLEAR THE ROOM.

27:52.930 --> 27:54.295
- I DON'T THINK
HE WAS WATCHING ME.

27:54.340 --> 27:57.298
HE WAS WATCHING CZARSKY.

28:04.310 --> 28:05.777
HEY.

28:05.810 --> 28:07.243
IS IT AREA CODES
OR STATE CAPITALS

28:07.280 --> 28:09.077
THAT YOU'RE
ALL RAIN MAN-Y WITH?

28:09.120 --> 28:10.417
- I'M RAIN MAN
WITH AREA CODES.

28:10.450 --> 28:12.213
STATE CAPITALS,
I'M MORE LIKE JOHN NASH.

28:12.250 --> 28:13.751
- THE DUDE FROM CLEAN HOUSE?

28:13.790 --> 28:15.109
- THAT'S NIECY NASH, SHAWN.

28:15.160 --> 28:17.253
AND SHE'S A FINE,
FULL-BODIED WOMAN. WHAT?

28:17.290 --> 28:18.359
- UH, 305.

28:18.390 --> 28:20.119
- MIAMI AND ALL
OF SOUTH FLORIDA.

28:20.160 --> 28:21.889
STATE CAPITAL--
TALLAHASSEE.

28:21.930 --> 28:23.864
- AUTHORITIES HAVE LONG SINCE
BEEN INVESTIGATING

28:23.900 --> 28:26.391
CZARSKY'S TIES
TO THE MIAMI-DADE COUNTY AREA.

28:28.300 --> 28:31.736
- HOLA. JUAN?
- QUE?

28:31.770 --> 28:33.237
- YOU GUYS, YOU'RE GONNA WANT
TO GET IN HERE.

28:33.270 --> 28:35.306
- UH, "TRAMPOLINA" GIGANTE.
I GOT TO GO, MAN.

28:35.340 --> 28:36.477
- JUAN?

28:36.510 --> 28:38.341
- HERE WE COME.

28:40.310 --> 28:42.915
- THIS SEEMS TO BE THE SOURCE
OF THE ODOR.

28:42.950 --> 28:44.417
AND THERE'S THIS.

28:44.450 --> 28:46.338
WHOEVER TOOK
THAT FOOTAGE OF YOU

28:46.390 --> 28:48.312
SURE SEEMS TO HAVE HIS OWN AX
TO GRIND WITH CZARSKY,

28:48.360 --> 28:49.281
BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

28:49.320 --> 28:50.924
THIS GUY WAS BUILDING A BOMB
TO KILL CZARSKY.

28:50.960 --> 28:52.951
- I'M GETTING SOMETHING.

28:52.990 --> 28:55.322
I THINK THIS MAY GO BACK TO
THE TIME CZARSKY SPENT IN MIAMI.

28:55.360 --> 28:58.124
AND I'M GETTING A NAME--JUAN.

28:58.170 --> 29:00.320
- IT'S MIAMI.
YOU GOT ANYTHING ELSE?

29:00.370 --> 29:03.965
- HE LIVES HERE NOW.
HE'S FROM MIAMI.

29:04.010 --> 29:06.331
- YOU THINKING
WHAT I'M THINKING?

29:06.370 --> 29:07.598
- GET THIS--

29:07.640 --> 29:10.768
VICE WAS TRYING TO NAIL CZARSKY
ON EXTORTION IN MIAMI FOR YEARS,

29:10.810 --> 29:13.404
WHICH IS WHY HE MOVED HIS DIRTY
BUSINESS TO THE WEST COAST.

29:13.450 --> 29:15.975
THE NIGHT BEFORE HE DISAPPEARED,
A RESTAURANT--

29:16.020 --> 29:18.011
TACOS AL CARMEN--

29:18.050 --> 29:19.779
THAT WAS IN THE HOTBED
OF CZARSKY'S OPERATIONS,

29:19.820 --> 29:21.117
IT BURNED TO THE GROUND.

29:21.160 --> 29:23.924
- DAG, I WOULD GIVE ANYTHING
FOR A TACO RIGHT NOW.

29:23.960 --> 29:27.282
- ONE OF THE PROPRIETORS
WAS KILLED IN THE FIRE--

29:27.330 --> 29:29.321
CARMEN VERIN.

29:29.360 --> 29:32.261
SHE CO-OWNED THE RESTAURANT
WITH A JUAN LAVA.

29:32.300 --> 29:35.463
- A JUAN FROM MIAMI WITH A SCORE
TO SETTLE WITH CZARSKY--

29:35.500 --> 29:38.060
GOOD JOB, SPENCER.

29:40.840 --> 29:42.979
- I DON'T KNOW.
THAT FEELS A LITTLE WEIRD.

29:43.010 --> 29:44.944
I'M SENSING THERE'S SOMETHING
MORE TO THE STORY.

29:44.980 --> 29:47.869
OUR JUAN WASN'T
THE CULINARY TYPE.

29:47.920 --> 29:49.171
- WE'RE GONNA
STAKE THE PLACE OUT

29:49.220 --> 29:50.346
TILL LITTLE BILLY BOMB MAKER
COMES HOME.

29:50.380 --> 29:52.189
GUSTER, YOU TAKE SPENCER.
TAKE YOUR FUNNY LITTLE CAR.

29:52.220 --> 29:53.312
PARK IT BEHIND CZARSKY'S LAIR.

29:53.350 --> 29:55.352
KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR THAT SNAKE
WHILE WE WAIT FOR LAVA.

29:56.960 --> 29:58.848
- ANYTHING NEW?
- NOPE.

29:58.890 --> 30:00.528
HE'S TILL PLAYING POKER
AND DRINKING ABSINTHE

30:00.560 --> 30:03.893
WITH THE PONYTAIL GUYS.

30:03.930 --> 30:06.125
- YOU KNOW, THEY SAY
THE WORMWOOD IN ABSINTHE

30:06.170 --> 30:07.967
MAKES YOUR SHADOW GLOW.

30:08.000 --> 30:11.265
WE SHOULD DO SHOTS,
THEN PLAY LASER TAG.

30:11.310 --> 30:13.972
- SHAWN, YOU NEED TO TRY
TO TAKE A NAP.

30:14.010 --> 30:16.274
YOU LOOK TIRED.
- [scoffs] GUS.

30:16.310 --> 30:18.449
DON'T BE KEITH SWEAT NOW.

30:18.480 --> 30:20.471
I'M SHARP AS A TACK.

30:33.230 --> 30:34.254
HEY.

30:34.300 --> 30:36.256
LONG TIME NO SEE.

30:36.300 --> 30:38.894
- NOT LONG ENOUGH.
- THAT'S NOT VERY NICE.

30:38.930 --> 30:40.466
- WHY AM I BACK HERE?
TELL ME THAT.

30:40.500 --> 30:42.229
- PERHAPS YOUR WORK
ON THIS PLANET ISN'T DONE.

30:42.270 --> 30:44.101
- I'M NOT FROM ANOTHER PLANET.

30:44.140 --> 30:46.131
- WELL, REGARDLESS.

30:46.170 --> 30:48.968
MY DAD WON'T TAKE MY CALLS,
AND HE WON'T SEE ME.

30:49.010 --> 30:50.307
- NOT SURPRISING.

30:50.340 --> 30:53.047
Ol-TENTIMES ON THESE JOURNEYS
OF CHARACTER DISCOVERY,

30:53.080 --> 30:55.446
I'VE FOUND THAT ONE RELATIONSHIP
PROVES MORE DIFFICULT

30:55.480 --> 30:56.970
THAN THE OTHERS TO RECTIFY.

30:57.020 --> 30:57.918
- IS THAT RIGHT?
- YEAH.

30:57.950 --> 30:59.417
- HOW MANY OF THESE THINGS
HAVE YOU DONE?

30:59.450 --> 31:01.315
- I DON'T OWE YOU
AN EXPLANATION.

31:01.360 --> 31:02.657
ANSWER ME THIS.

31:02.690 --> 31:04.521
WHY'D HE TAKE THAT JOB
IN THE FIRST PLACE, HUH?

31:04.560 --> 31:06.118
- I GUESS HE WANTED
TO PROTECT ME

31:06.160 --> 31:07.991
DURING THE YIN INVESTIGATION.

31:08.030 --> 31:10.328
- MAYBE IN HIS OWN WAY,
HE'S STILL PROTECTING YOU.

31:10.360 --> 31:13.329
AND MAYBE HE'S ENJOYING WORKING
WITH YOU IN THE PROCESS.

31:13.370 --> 31:15.395
YOU EVER THINK OF THAT?

31:19.570 --> 31:21.276
I'M STILL HERE.

31:21.310 --> 31:23.198
NORMALLY,
FOLKS KIND OF BLINK ME AWAY

31:23.240 --> 31:25.105
WHEN THEY COME
TO A REALIZATION.

31:25.150 --> 31:26.447
YOU GET IT?

31:26.480 --> 31:28.675
- WELL, MR. SNOWBALL-SLINGER—
TO-THE-FACE,

31:28.720 --> 31:32.042
I HAPPEN TO BE A BIG FAN
OF THE AWKWARD EXIT.

31:32.090 --> 31:34.456
- I HATE YOU.

31:36.660 --> 31:38.321
AAH.

31:38.360 --> 31:40.055
- SHAWN!
- KAREEM.

31:40.090 --> 31:41.227
YOU TOOK OFF YOUR GOGGLES.
- WHAT?

31:41.260 --> 31:42.329
- WHAT?

31:42.360 --> 31:43.588
- THAT WAS LASSITER.

31:43.630 --> 31:45.325
THEY'VE HAD JUAN
IN INTERROGATION FOR AN HOUR,

31:45.370 --> 31:46.325
BUT HE WON'T TALK.

31:46.370 --> 31:47.462
HE WANTS YOU
TO GIVE IT A TRY--

31:47.500 --> 31:50.298
ON THE D.L., SINCE, TECHNICALLY,
YOU'RE STILL SUSPENDED.

31:50.340 --> 31:51.659
- I WILL CRACK HIM.

31:51.710 --> 31:54.178
I WILL CRACK HIM
LIKE A CHESTNUT.

31:54.210 --> 31:55.302
YOU STAY HERE, GUS.

31:55.340 --> 31:58.138
CALL IF YOU SEE
ANYTHING WEIRD, OKAY?

31:58.180 --> 32:01.274
YOU REALIZE I'M GONNA HAVE
TO TAKE THE BLUEBERRY?

32:05.390 --> 32:07.085
JUAN, MY NAME IS SHAWN.

32:07.120 --> 32:09.315
- I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.
- I'M HERE TO HELP.

32:09.360 --> 32:11.328
AND I LOVED YOU
IN Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN.

32:11.360 --> 32:14.124
- I'M A CUBAN-AMERICAN
IN MY 30$.

32:14.160 --> 32:16.253
THOSE GUYS
WERE MEXICAN TEENAGERS...

32:16.300 --> 32:18.097
PLAYED BY GUYS IN THEIR 20$.

32:18.130 --> 32:20.018
- THAT'S FAIR.

32:22.470 --> 32:24.461
- ONE OF THE PROPRIETORS
DIED IN THE FIRE--

32:24.510 --> 32:26.000
CARMEN VERIN.

32:26.040 --> 32:29.237
SHE CO-OWNED THE RESTAURANT
WITH A JUAN LAVA.

32:29.280 --> 32:30.235
- CARMEN...

32:30.280 --> 32:32.544
SHE WAS MORE THAN JUST
YOUR BUSINESS PARTNER.

32:32.580 --> 32:35.640
SHE WAS YOUR FIANCEE,
WASN'T SHE?

32:35.680 --> 32:37.341
YES.

32:37.380 --> 32:39.280
YOU OPENED THAT RESTAURANT
FOR HER, JUAN.

32:39.320 --> 32:42.289
YOU'RE A GOOD
BUT DESPERATE MAN.

32:42.320 --> 32:44.288
- HE TOOK...

32:44.330 --> 32:46.082
MY WHOLE WORLD AWAY
THAT NIGHT.

32:46.130 --> 32:47.995
BUT THEY RULED IT AN ACCIDENT?

32:50.360 --> 32:51.463
HE CAN STILL HURT PEOPLE.

32:51.500 --> 32:53.320
AND IF THAT'S THE BEST
YOU CAN DO,

32:53.370 --> 32:54.496
THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

32:54.540 --> 32:56.337
I WAS CASING THAT GUY
FOR MONTHS.

32:56.370 --> 32:58.634
YOU GOT IN THE WAY.

32:58.670 --> 33:01.468
I HAD NO CHOICE
BUT TO TURN OVER THAT FOOTAGE.

33:01.510 --> 33:04.047
HE WOULDN'T HAVE DONE
ANY REAL TIME.

33:04.080 --> 33:06.275
THE ONLY WAY TO STOP A GUY
LIKE CZARSKY...

33:06.310 --> 33:07.675
IS TO PUT HIM IN THE GROUND.

33:07.710 --> 33:09.746
- NO, JUAN, YOU ARE NOT
A MURDERER.

33:09.780 --> 33:11.418
YOU ARE A GOOD MAN.

33:11.450 --> 33:12.417
AND IF YOU KILL THIS GUY,

33:12.450 --> 33:15.385
YOU WILL SPEND THE REST
OF YOUR LIFE IN JAIL.

33:15.420 --> 33:16.557
I WILL MAKE YOU A PROMISE.

33:16.590 --> 33:18.148
I WILL NAIL THIS GUY

33:18.190 --> 33:20.021
FOR A HELL OF A LOT MORE
THAN TAX FRAUD,

33:20.060 --> 33:21.459
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO GIVE ME
A CHANCE, MAN.

33:21.500 --> 33:23.627
GIVE ME A CHANCE.

33:23.660 --> 33:25.662
- IT'S TOO LATE.

33:25.700 --> 33:27.725
OH, FORGIVE ME.

33:29.570 --> 33:31.800
[watch beeping]

33:31.840 --> 33:34.274
- CZARSKY'S GONNA BLOW UP
IN 24 MINUTES.

33:37.380 --> 33:41.271
[siren wailing]
- WE'VE GOT LESS THAN 15.

33:41.320 --> 33:44.619
- TELL ME EXACTLY WHERE THE BOMB
IS AND HOW TO DEFUSE IT.

33:44.650 --> 33:47.118
TELL ME.
YOU CAN STILL HAVE A LIFE.

33:47.150 --> 33:48.378
TELL ME, JUAN.

33:48.420 --> 33:50.217
THINK OF CARMEN.

33:50.260 --> 33:52.421
TELL ME NOW.
NOW!

33:52.460 --> 33:55.122
[siren wailing]

33:55.160 --> 33:57.299
[tires screeching]

33:57.330 --> 34:00.163
[indistinct chatter
over police radio]

34:00.200 --> 34:02.691
- IT'S ABOUT TIME WE GOT
SOME LAW AND ORDER AROUND HERE.

34:02.740 --> 34:03.968
- SHUT UP.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.764
I DIDN'T JOIN THE FORCE TO SAVE
WORLD-CLASS SCUMBAGS LIKE YOU.

34:06.810 --> 34:07.731
- ALL RIGHT, 30 SECONDS!

34:07.770 --> 34:10.170
SECURE THE PERIMETER
AND BRACE FOR IMPACT!

34:10.210 --> 34:12.098
I SWEAR TO GOD...

34:12.150 --> 34:15.142
IF I LOSE ONE OF MY PEOPLE...

34:26.490 --> 34:27.684
- CLEAR!

34:28.830 --> 34:31.048
CLEAR!

34:36.570 --> 34:38.458
- LONG TIME NO SEE.

34:38.510 --> 34:40.762
HOW'S THAT PRETTY LITTLE LADY
OF YOURS, HUH?

34:40.810 --> 34:43.677
SHE'S NOT STILL SMOKING
I HOPE.

34:43.710 --> 34:45.302
- SON OF A--
- HEY, HEY, HEY.

34:45.350 --> 34:48.615
- KEEP LAUGHING...
ALL THE WAY TO SAN QUENTIN.

34:48.650 --> 34:51.244
- YOU'LL NEVER GET ANYONE
TO TESTIFY AGAINST ME,

34:51.290 --> 34:53.485
NOT IN THIS LIFETIME.

34:56.490 --> 34:58.219
_ NO--

34:58.260 --> 35:00.353
- I WILL TESTIFY.

35:00.390 --> 35:02.494
- HAVEN'T YOU EMBARRASSED
YOURSELF ENOUGH ALREADY?

35:02.530 --> 35:03.792
- HARDLY.

35:03.830 --> 35:06.492
I'M JUST GETTING STARTED,
YOU GIANT COCKROACH.

35:06.530 --> 35:09.499
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT WAS OUT OF LINE.

35:09.540 --> 35:12.202
I APOLOGIZE
TO COCKROACHES EVERYWHERE,

35:12.240 --> 35:13.901
ESPECIALLY JIMINY CRICKET,

35:13.940 --> 35:15.407
ALTHOUGH FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN OVER 30 YEARS,

35:15.440 --> 35:17.806
IT OCCURS TO ME...
HE MIGHT BE A CRICKET.

35:17.840 --> 35:21.219
- OF COURSE HE'S A CRICKET.

35:21.250 --> 35:22.547
- I WILL TESTIFY

35:22.580 --> 35:24.138
THAT, EVEN THOUGH
I CAN'T PROVE IT,

35:24.190 --> 35:27.318
CZARSKY'S EXTORTING
YOUR HARD-EARNED WAGES,

35:27.350 --> 35:29.784
MAKING YOU PAY
BY THREATENING YOUR LIVES

35:29.820 --> 35:32.459
AND THE LIVES
OF YOUR LOVED ONES.

35:32.490 --> 35:34.697
- I WILL TESTIFY...

35:34.730 --> 35:36.755
THAT, EVEN THOUGH
I CAN'T PROVE IT,

35:36.800 --> 35:39.564
CZARSKY USES YOUR LEGITIMATE
BUSINESSES AS FENCES

35:39.600 --> 35:42.763
FOR HIS CRIMINAL OPERATIONS
AND DASTARDLY DEEDS.

35:42.800 --> 35:45.405
- WE TOOK AN OATH
TO SERVE AND PROTECT YOU,

35:45.440 --> 35:47.169
BUT WE CAN'T ALWAYS DO IT
ON OUR OWN.

35:47.210 --> 35:48.438
SOMETIMES WE NEED YOUR HELP.

35:48.480 --> 35:50.573
- WE KNOW THIS IS EASY
FOR US TO SAY.

35:50.610 --> 35:52.942
WE DON'T KNOW HOW IT FEELS
TO BE YOU.

35:52.980 --> 35:55.278
BUT THERE IS SOMEONE WHO DOES.

36:03.360 --> 36:06.181
-IDO.

36:06.230 --> 36:08.892
THAT MAN KILLED MY FIANCEE.

36:08.930 --> 36:11.819
HER NAME WAS CARMEN.

36:11.870 --> 36:14.589
HER DREAM WAS TO HAVE
HER OWN RESTAURANT.

36:14.640 --> 36:16.232
SHE HAD A GIFT.

36:16.270 --> 36:19.205
SHE WANTED TO SHARE IT
WITH AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE.

36:19.240 --> 36:20.969
THEY WOULD LIGHT UP
WHEN THEY ATE HER FOOD,

36:21.010 --> 36:23.433
AND SHE WOULD LIGHT UP
WATCHING THEM.

36:23.480 --> 36:25.948
WE REFUSED TO PAY HIM
FOR NOTHING,

36:25.980 --> 36:28.517
SO HE BURNED
OUR RESTAURANT DOWN...

36:28.550 --> 36:32.441
WHILE SHE WAS STILL INSIDE.

36:32.490 --> 36:34.913
THINK OF YOUR FAMILIES...

36:34.960 --> 36:36.814
YOUR CHILDREN.

36:36.860 --> 36:39.658
ANYONE OF YOU COULD BE NEXT,
AND HE'S JUST GETTING STARTED.

36:39.690 --> 36:42.989
I KNOW YOU'RE SCARED.

36:43.030 --> 36:45.498
BUT HE CAN'T TOUCH US
IF WE STAND TOGETHER.

36:48.640 --> 36:50.835
- NICE TRY.

36:50.870 --> 36:53.759
GOT ME RIGHT HERE.

36:56.610 --> 36:59.443
- I WILL TESTIFY.

36:59.480 --> 37:02.244
HE COLLECT S ON THURSDAYS,
AND I CAN PROVE IT.

37:02.280 --> 37:04.419
- I'LL TESTIFY.

37:04.450 --> 37:07.578
HE STASHES HIS CONTRABAND
IN MY GARAGE.

37:07.620 --> 37:11.351
- I'M DONE
WITH BEING AFRAID.

37:11.390 --> 37:15.326
YOU BET YOUR ASS
I'LL TESTIFY.

37:17.900 --> 37:19.993
- SERGEI CZARSKY. ..

37:20.030 --> 37:21.497
IT GIVES ME GREAT PLEASURE

37:21.540 --> 37:23.599
TO SAY THAT YOU ARE
UNDER ARREST.

37:23.640 --> 37:26.302
[cheers and applause]

37:30.080 --> 37:31.445
- YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT.

37:31.480 --> 37:34.608
- ALL THE WAY TO SAN QUENTIN.

37:34.650 --> 37:35.878
- YOU...

37:35.920 --> 37:37.842
- LASSIE,
BEFORE YOU GO OFF ON ME,

37:37.880 --> 37:40.713
I WAS WAY, WAY OFF
ON THE WHOLE BOMB THING.

37:40.750 --> 37:43.685
IT TURNS OUT JUAN HERE WAS
JUST COUNTING DOWN THE MINUTES

37:43.720 --> 37:45.950
TO TONIGHT'S SEASON PREMIERE
OF TRUE BLOOD.

37:45.990 --> 37:46.922
- SOOKIE.

37:46.960 --> 37:48.848
- NICE TRY, SPENCER.

37:48.900 --> 37:50.527
BUT THAT BOMB WOULD'VE BLOWN US
ALL TO HELL

37:50.560 --> 37:52.323
IF IT WEREN'T FOR
CAPTAIN LANE SCOTT THOMAS HERE

37:52.370 --> 37:53.689
AND THE ENTIRE BOMB SQUAD.

37:53.730 --> 37:55.459
- ACTUALLY, DETECTIVE,
IT WAS A FALSE ALARM.

37:55.500 --> 37:56.694
- WHAT?

37:56.740 --> 37:58.537
- WE WERE CLEAR
BECAUSE THERE WAS NO BOMB.

37:58.570 --> 38:01.403
MY TEAM SEARCHED EVERY INCH
OF THAT BUILDING.

38:01.440 --> 38:02.976
- LIKE I SAID, MY BAD.

38:03.010 --> 38:05.001
BUT IT ALL WORKED OUT
IN THE END, HUH?

38:05.050 --> 38:07.006
- ALL RIGHT.

38:07.050 --> 38:08.972
LET'S HIT IT, O'HARA.
WE GOT A LOT OF BOOKING TO DO.

38:09.020 --> 38:10.908
IT'S BEST CHRISTMAS
I'VE HAD SINCE...

38:10.950 --> 38:11.917
EVER.

38:11.950 --> 38:13.838
CATCH .

38:13.890 --> 38:16.814
- WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE FREE TO GO, MR. LAVA.

38:19.060 --> 38:21.597
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

38:21.630 --> 38:23.848
- MERRY CHRISTMAS.

38:23.900 --> 38:24.924
[car door closes]

38:24.970 --> 38:27.063
YOU GUYS WANT SOME EGGNOG?

38:27.100 --> 38:28.533
both: YES.

38:28.570 --> 38:32.358
- JUAN LAVA'S
LACTOSE-FREE EGGNOG.

38:32.410 --> 38:33.866
ARE YOU GUYS HEARING ME?

38:33.910 --> 38:35.707
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
HOW JINGLY IT IS?

38:35.740 --> 38:36.934
BECAUSE AS SOON AS YOU
HEAR LAVA,

38:36.980 --> 38:38.538
YOU'RE NOT THINKING
ABOUT LACTOSE.

38:38.580 --> 38:40.377
- OKAY, SHAWN, THAT'S ENOUGH...

38:40.410 --> 38:42.014
SERIOUSLY.

38:42.050 --> 38:45.087
JUAN, THAT TOOK SOME
REAL COURAGE SPEAKING UP.

38:45.120 --> 38:47.088
- WELL, THANK YOU GUYS
FOR GIVING ME A SECOND CHANCE.

38:47.120 --> 38:48.519
I THINK I'M GONNA STAY HERE
FOR A WHILE.

38:48.560 --> 38:49.686
- GOOD FOR YOU.

38:49.720 --> 38:51.051
- YEAH, I LIKE IT HERE.
- REALLY?

38:51.090 --> 38:53.422
- IT'S SUPER CHEAP.
- MM.

38:53.460 --> 38:56.020
- TAKE CARE, GUYS.
- OKAY, JUAN.

38:56.060 --> 38:57.527
- MERRY CHRISTMAS.
- YEAH.

39:01.030 --> 39:02.566
ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE IT.

39:02.600 --> 39:05.000
- DON'T YOU EVER, EVER ASK ME
TO DEFUSE A BOMB AGAIN.

39:05.040 --> 39:06.064
YOU HEAR ME?
- WHOO.

39:06.110 --> 39:08.066
- TAKE THE RED WIRE,
AND YOU CUT THAT ONE FIRST.

39:08.110 --> 39:10.078
- COME ON, THE INSTRUCTIONS
WERE SO SIMPLE.

39:10.110 --> 39:11.134
AND LOOK AT THAT.

39:11.180 --> 39:13.000
YOU DID IT WITH THREE AND A HALF
MINUTES TO SPARE.

39:13.050 --> 39:14.847
- YOU KNOW MY THUMBS FLUTTER
LIKE HUMMINGBIRD WINGS

39:14.880 --> 39:15.972
IN HIGH-PRESSURE SITUATIONS.

39:16.020 --> 39:17.510
- AH, YOU WERE BRILLIANT.

39:17.550 --> 39:19.108
AS USUAL, I COULDN'T HAVE DONE
IT WITHOUT YOU.

39:19.150 --> 39:20.481
WHERE'S THE REST OF THE BOMB?

39:20.520 --> 39:22.056
- IN A DUMPSTER
BEHIND THE A.M.P.M.

39:22.090 --> 39:23.318
- NICE.

39:23.360 --> 39:26.158
WELL, LET'S HIT D.Q. COUNTRY.
I BELIEVE I OWE YOU A DILLY BAR.

39:26.190 --> 39:29.023
- WE HAVE NO CAR, SHAWN.
- IT'S NOT TOO FAR.

39:29.060 --> 39:32.461
WE CAN WALK IT, JUST LIKE
WE DID IN LITTLE LEAGUE.

39:45.480 --> 39:48.415
- IMPRESSIVE WORK,
MR. SPENCER.

39:48.450 --> 39:49.371
YOU REALLY
TURNED THINGS AROUND.

39:49.420 --> 39:50.444
- WELL, THE TRUTH IS
I DON'T DESERVE CREDIT

39:50.480 --> 39:52.619
FOR RIGHTING A WRONG
THAT WAS MINE TO BEGIN WITH.

39:52.650 --> 39:54.618
LASSITER AND JULIET ARE THE ONES
THAT SHOULD BE COMMENDED.

39:54.660 --> 39:55.752
- WHICH IS WHAT
I TOLD THE MAYOR.

39:55.790 --> 39:58.429
I ALSO SPOKE
TO INTERNAL AFFAIRS.

39:58.460 --> 39:59.654
- RIGHT.

39:59.690 --> 40:01.419
- CONSIDERING WE WERE ABLE
TO GET CZARSKY

40:01.460 --> 40:04.122
ON MUCH MORE SERIOUS CHARGES
THAN WE HAD BEFORE,

40:04.160 --> 40:07.197
TH EY'VE CONCLUDED
THEIR INVESTIGATION.

40:07.230 --> 40:08.538
- REALLY?

40:08.570 --> 40:09.798
- BUT THAT DOESN'T CHANGE
THE FACT

40:09.840 --> 40:13.560
THAT YOU CAUSED THIS DEPARTMENT
A GREAT DEAL OF EMBARRASSMENT.

40:13.610 --> 40:16.534
SO I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOUR FACE
AROUND HERE...

40:16.580 --> 40:19.743
AT LEAST UNTIL
AFTER THE NEW YEAR.

40:20.850 --> 40:23.216
- THAT'S MORE THAN FAIR.
[chuckles]

40:23.250 --> 40:25.047
IN THE SPIRIT
OF, UH, THE YULETIDE,

40:25.090 --> 40:26.910
MIGHT I MAKE A REQUEST
OF MY OWN, CHIEF?

40:26.950 --> 40:28.679
- I'M LISTENING.
- IT'S NOT FOR ME.

40:28.720 --> 40:30.585
IT'S, UM...

40:30.620 --> 40:32.622
IT'S FOR MY DAD, RIGHT?

40:32.660 --> 40:34.651
I MEAN, HE'S--HE'S KIND OF BEEN
A DIFFERENT MAN,

40:34.700 --> 40:37.954
IF YOU HADN'T NOTICED, UH, SINCE
HE STARTED WORKING HERE AGAIN.

40:38.000 --> 40:39.661
I MEAN, HIS EATING HABITS
HAVEN'T CHANGED,

40:39.700 --> 40:41.565
AND HE STILL WATCHES RERUNS
OF THE RIFLEMAN, BUT--

40:41.600 --> 40:43.636
- YOUR FATHER CAN HAVE HIS JOB
BACK IF HE WANTS IT, SHAWN.

40:43.670 --> 40:44.602
- OH.

40:44.640 --> 40:46.130
- BUT THE RULES
ARE STILL GONNA BE THE SAME.

40:46.170 --> 40:47.660
YOU'RE STILL GONNA HAVE
TO ANSWER TO HIM.

40:47.710 --> 40:48.699
- OH, I KNOW.

40:48.740 --> 40:50.776
YES, I KNOW.
I, UH...

40:50.810 --> 40:52.801
THANK YOU, CHIEF.
THANK YOU.

40:52.850 --> 40:56.115
- MERRY CHRISTMAS,
MR. SPENCER.

40:56.150 --> 40:58.618
- MAY I, FOR THE ROAD?
- PLEASE.

40:58.650 --> 41:01.619
[indie rock music]

41:01.660 --> 41:09.658
*

41:32.650 --> 41:34.754
- AHH.

41:37.620 --> 41:40.589
[snickers]

41:40.630 --> 41:48.639
*

42:11.060 --> 42:14.052
[laughing]

42:19.630 --> 42:21.632
OH, MY GOD.

42:21.670 --> 42:23.262
OH, GOD.
