OLIVER THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR

00:39.272 --> 00:41.408

00:41.408 --> 00:43.243
WEEK FROM TRUMP ANNOUNCING PLANS

00:43.243 --> 00:44.811
TO RUIN YOUR THANKSGIVING AT

00:44.811 --> 00:45.278
LEAST ONE MORE TIME TO

00:45.278 --> 00:46.646
NANCY PELOSI ANNOUNCING SHE WILL

00:46.646 --> 00:48.248
STEP DOWN FROM HER LEADERSHIP

00:48.248 --> 00:49.783
ROLE IN THE HOUSE TO PARIS

00:49.783 --> 00:52.419
REVEALING ITS OLYMPIC MASCOT

00:52.419 --> 00:52.886
WHICH LOOKS LIKE IT'S

00:52.886 --> 00:55.588
ADVERTISING A WORLDWIDE SPORTING

00:55.588 --> 00:57.023
EVENT AND MORE LIKE A

00:57.023 --> 00:57.991
GYNECOLOGIST SPENT TOO MUCH ON

00:57.991 --> 00:58.258
MARKETING.

00:58.258 --> 01:00.660
WE ARE GOING TO START WITH THE

01:00.660 --> 01:01.828
ONGOING CHAOS AT TWITTER, IT'S

01:01.828 --> 01:02.862
BEEN THREE WEEKS SINCE IT WAS

01:02.862 --> 01:04.297
TAKEN OVER BY ELON MUSK A MAN

01:04.297 --> 01:08.968
WHO ANSWERS THE QUESTION WHAT IF

01:08.968 --> 01:09.502
WILLY WONKA BENEFITED FROM

01:09.502 --> 01:10.870
APARTHEID THE?

01:11.137 --> 01:13.406
GOING BACK TO THE START OF HIS

01:13.406 --> 01:14.040
TAKEOVER, FROM DAY ONE TREND IT

01:14.040 --> 01:17.343
WAS A TOTAL MESS.

01:17.343 --> 01:19.746
HE POSTED A VIDEO OF HIM

01:19.746 --> 01:21.114
ARRIVING AT TWITTER'S HQ.

01:21.114 --> 01:23.583
LET THAT SINK AND HE TOLD US.

01:23.583 --> 01:25.185
HE ANNOUNCED COMEDY IS NOW LEGAL

01:25.185 --> 01:26.386
ON TWITTER.

01:26.386 --> 01:28.188
OKAY THEN.

01:28.188 --> 01:31.024
IF COMEDY IS NOW LEGAL WE

01:31.024 --> 01:31.624
PROBABLY NEED TO RECONVENE THE

01:31.624 --> 01:33.593
COMEDY SUPREME COURT TO SET A

01:33.593 --> 01:35.228
PRECEDENT ABOUT THAT PARTICULAR

01:35.228 --> 01:36.529
VIOLATION OF COMEDY MALL RIGHT

01:36.529 --> 01:37.730
THERE.

01:37.730 --> 01:38.665
MANY OF THE WORST PEOPLE

01:38.665 --> 01:41.401
ON TWITTER SEEM TO TAKE IT AS

01:41.401 --> 01:44.003
THE BRAKES ARE NOW OFF, FINDING

01:44.003 --> 01:48.241
USE OF A RACIAL SLUR SPIKING

01:48.241 --> 01:49.476
NEARLY 500%.

01:49.476 --> 01:50.710
WHICH IS PRETTY SHOCKING EVEN

01:50.710 --> 01:53.179
FOR A WEBSITE WHERE A REGULAR

01:53.179 --> 01:56.483
TRENDING TOPIC IS SOMETIMES JUST

01:56.483 --> 01:59.819
"THE JEWS."

01:59.819 --> 02:03.122
30,000 PEOPLE TWEETING ABOUT THE

02:03.122 --> 02:04.057
JEWS ON A THURSDAY AFTERNOON YOU

02:04.057 --> 02:06.626
DO NOT WANT TO CLICK TO FIND OUT

02:06.626 --> 02:07.227
WHY.

02:07.227 --> 02:08.795
HE INITIALLY TRIED TO SET

02:08.795 --> 02:09.696
EXPECTATIONS LOW TWEETING PLEASE

02:09.696 --> 02:13.933
OF DUMB THINGS IN THE COMING

02:13.933 --> 02:14.501
MONTHS, SOMETHING HE THEN

02:14.501 --> 02:17.036
ELABORATED ON LIKE THIS.

02:17.036 --> 02:19.372
THE INTENT IS NOT TO DO DUMB

02:19.372 --> 02:20.139
THINGS, WE AREN'T ASPIRATIONAL

02:20.139 --> 02:23.076
LAY DUMB.

02:23.076 --> 02:26.813
WE ARE ASPIRATIONAL HE NOT DUMB.

02:26.813 --> 02:28.581
IF YOU HAVE TO SAY WE

02:28.581 --> 02:29.983
ARE NOT DUMB IN THREE SLIGHTLY

02:29.983 --> 02:32.285
DIFFERENT WAYS IN A ROW THAT

02:32.285 --> 02:33.019
DOESN'T INSPIRE CONFIDENCE.

02:33.019 --> 02:36.556
IT'S LIKE SOMEONE GOING "I'M

02:36.556 --> 02:38.625
SOBER, I'M NOT DRUNK, I'M GOOD

02:38.625 --> 02:39.926
TO DRIVE."

02:39.926 --> 02:41.361
AT THE END OF THOSE THREE

02:41.361 --> 02:42.228
STATEMENTS I'M NOT HANDING YOU

02:42.228 --> 02:43.796
THE KEYS TO ANYTHING.

02:43.796 --> 02:45.331
ALSO TWITTER HAS ALWAYS BEEN A

02:45.331 --> 02:47.267
PLACE WHERE YOU SHOULD BE

02:47.267 --> 02:48.034
ASPIRATIONAL LAY DUMB.

02:48.034 --> 02:50.503
IF IT ENDS UP BECOMING SOMEWHERE

02:50.503 --> 02:53.473
YOU CAN'T TWEET THE BABA DUKE

02:53.473 --> 02:54.107
THROAT GAME PROBABLY CRAZY AND

02:54.107 --> 02:57.744
GET A QUARTER A MILLION LIKES I

02:57.744 --> 02:59.946
DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IT

02:59.946 --> 03:01.614
ANYMORE.

03:01.614 --> 03:03.016
INDEED THEY HAVE DONE SOME VERY

03:03.016 --> 03:04.784
DUMB THINGS, A NEW PROGRAM WENT

03:04.784 --> 03:07.820
LIVE FOR THE SITE CHARGED $8 A

03:07.820 --> 03:09.255
MONTH FOR BLUE CHECKMARKS, USED

03:09.255 --> 03:11.991
TO VERIFY COMPANIES ACTUALLY ARE

03:11.991 --> 03:13.960
WHO THEY SAID THEY WERE.

03:13.960 --> 03:16.796
WHEN AMTRAK POSTED THE ACTUAL

03:16.796 --> 03:17.597
TWEET "TRAINS."

03:17.597 --> 03:19.766
YOU KNEW AN EXPERT WAS WEIGHING

03:19.766 --> 03:20.833
IN.

03:20.833 --> 03:21.634
AND THAT SELLING THAT

03:21.634 --> 03:23.636
VERIFICATION FOR $8 HAD

03:23.636 --> 03:24.203
PREDICTABLE RESULTS.

03:24.203 --> 03:26.272
I WANT TO SHOW YOU A FEW OF

03:26.272 --> 03:28.741
THE FAKE ACCOUNTS THAT HAVE

03:28.741 --> 03:29.042
POPPED UP.

03:29.042 --> 03:32.445
FAKE ACCOUNT FOR NINTENDO, THE

03:32.445 --> 03:34.347
VIDEO GAME COMPANY SHOWED MARIO

03:34.347 --> 03:35.014
THERE, THE ICONIC FIGURE GIVING

03:35.014 --> 03:39.819
THE FINGER.

03:39.819 --> 03:41.888
IT'S OFFENSIVE, I GUESS.

03:41.888 --> 03:43.957
I GUESS IT IS.

03:43.957 --> 03:46.359
OF MARIO GIVING THE FINGER

03:46.359 --> 03:48.928
APPARENTLY UNACCEPTABLE BUT 500%

03:48.928 --> 03:51.731
INCREASE IN RACISM, WHAT ARE YOU

03:51.731 --> 03:52.599
GOING TO DO?

03:52.599 --> 03:55.602
THAT DOESN'T COUNT, THAT WAS

03:55.602 --> 03:57.236
ALLOWED, I CHECKED.

03:57.236 --> 03:59.672
IT WASN'T JUST NINTENDO A FAKE

03:59.672 --> 04:01.207
VERIFIED PEPSI ACCOUNTS TWEETED

04:01.207 --> 04:04.277
COKE IS BETTER, AMERICAN GIRL

04:04.277 --> 04:05.278

04:05.278 --> 04:07.246
SLAVES WHICH MAKES YOU WONDER

04:07.246 --> 04:08.615
WHAT FELICITY DISCOVERS THE

04:08.615 --> 04:10.617
SECRET WAS REALLY ABOUT AND A

04:10.617 --> 04:12.418
FAKE VERIFY TESLA ACCOUNT

04:12.418 --> 04:14.354
TWEETED WE WILL BE OFFERING

04:14.354 --> 04:16.055
10,000 VEHICLES TO THE UKRAINIAN

04:16.055 --> 04:17.991
MILITARY, OUR CARS ARE THE MOST

04:17.991 --> 04:19.258
ADVANCED EXPLOSIVE DEVICES ON

04:19.258 --> 04:20.026
THE MARKET.

04:20.026 --> 04:21.461
CLEARLY THINGS ARE CHANGING

04:21.461 --> 04:23.496
ON TWITTER RIGHT NOW.

04:23.496 --> 04:25.331
THE SITE NO LONGER SEEMS TO BE

04:25.331 --> 04:27.834
ADDING EXPLANATIONS TO TRENDING

04:27.834 --> 04:29.636
TOPICS, PREVIOUSLY HELPED ADD

04:29.636 --> 04:30.970
CONTEXT AND HELP COMBAT THIS

04:30.970 --> 04:31.270
INFORMATION.

04:31.270 --> 04:35.074
WHICH IS WHY R.I.P. JIMMY FALLON

04:35.074 --> 04:36.376
WAS TWEETED WITH NO FURTHER

04:36.376 --> 04:39.712
INFORMATION WHICH PROMPTED

04:39.712 --> 04:42.415
FALLON HIMSELF TO POST CAN YOU

04:42.415 --> 04:47.820
FIX THIS WHICH PROMPTED HIM TO

04:47.820 --> 04:48.388
RESPOND FIX WHAT?

04:48.388 --> 04:49.389
A VERY FUNNY RESPONSE.

04:49.389 --> 04:52.025
ALL OF THIS IS TAKING A REAL

04:52.025 --> 04:53.326
TOLL, MAJOR ADVERTISERS HAVE

04:53.326 --> 04:54.560
PULLED THEIR ADVERTISING REVENUE

04:54.560 --> 04:57.030
INCLUDING GENERAL MILLS, GM,

04:57.030 --> 04:57.864
UNITED AIRLINES, AND PFIZER

04:57.864 --> 04:59.532
WHICH IS PROBABLY A SMART MOVE

04:59.532 --> 05:00.433
FOR THEM.

05:00.433 --> 05:02.301
WE ARE ABOUT FIVE SECONDS AWAY

05:02.301 --> 05:06.305
FROM A FAKE PFIZER ACCOUNT

05:06.305 --> 05:08.474
TWEETING THE RUMORS ARE TRUE OR

05:08.474 --> 05:12.545
A FAKE GENERAL MILLS ACCOUNT

05:12.545 --> 05:13.946
TWEETING AT CHEERIOS OUR COCK

05:13.946 --> 05:15.148
RINGS FOR MICE.

05:15.148 --> 05:16.382
AS FOR WORKING INSIDE TWITTER

05:16.382 --> 05:17.884
THAT IS AN ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE,

05:17.884 --> 05:20.486
MUSK HAS GOTTEN BITTEN OF HALF

05:20.486 --> 05:21.821
THE STAFF TARGETING ANY WORKERS

05:21.821 --> 05:23.122
WHO HAVE CRITICIZED HIM AT

05:23.122 --> 05:24.424
ONE POINT ENGINEERS WERE ASKED

05:24.424 --> 05:25.925
TO PRINT OUT THEIR RECENT CODE

05:25.925 --> 05:28.361
CONTRIBUTIONS SO THEY COULD BE

05:28.361 --> 05:30.329
EVALUATED WHICH IS NOT ONLY HOW

05:30.329 --> 05:31.197
YOU WOULD TRADITIONALLY EVALUATE

05:31.197 --> 05:33.199
CODE, IT'S ALSO A SECURITY RISK

05:33.199 --> 05:34.400
WHICH IS PRESUMABLY WHY

05:34.400 --> 05:36.102
ENGINEERS WERE QUICKLY TOLD TO

05:36.102 --> 05:39.372
SHRED THEIR PRINTOUTS.

05:39.372 --> 05:40.506
SOME ARGUE THERE WAS A METHOD TO

05:40.506 --> 05:42.775
THIS MADNESS, OTHERS AREN'T SO

05:42.775 --> 05:43.209
SURE.

05:43.209 --> 05:44.811
YOU DON'T FIRE HALF THE

05:44.811 --> 05:45.945
PEOPLE THAT WORK AT A COMPANY

05:45.945 --> 05:50.750
UNLESS YOU HAVE A PLAN.

05:50.750 --> 05:56.189
YEAH, I MEAN I DON'T KNOW.

05:56.189 --> 05:56.756
THIS GUY SIGN SOME PAPERWORK

05:56.756 --> 05:59.892
EIGHT MONTHS AGO THAT IT BECAME

05:59.892 --> 06:01.360
VERY CLEAR HE DIDN'T WANT TO

06:01.360 --> 06:02.962
SIGN AND LATER ON SPENT SEVEN

06:02.962 --> 06:04.430
MONTHS TRYING TO RENEGE ON IT.

06:04.430 --> 06:06.699
IF HE HAS A PLAN I WOULD LIKE TO

06:06.699 --> 06:09.602
SEE IT, IT IS NOT A PUBLICLY

06:09.602 --> 06:10.136
AVAILABLE ONE.

06:10.136 --> 06:11.370
RIGHT.

06:11.370 --> 06:12.338
IT SURE SEEMS LIKE ELON MUSK

06:12.338 --> 06:14.874
DOESN'T HAVE A PLAN, HE SEEMS TO

06:14.874 --> 06:17.043
BE CROWDSOURCING ADVICE WITH

06:17.043 --> 06:18.244
DESPERATE TWEETS LIKE "WHAT

06:18.244 --> 06:19.612
SHOULD TWITTER DO NEXT?"

06:19.612 --> 06:25.451
THAT'S WHEN HE'S NOT SHARING

06:25.451 --> 06:27.987
MEMES, HE CAPTIONED THIS ROCKS.

06:27.987 --> 06:30.623
THIS IS WHAT HE SPENT

06:30.623 --> 06:32.358
$44 BILLION TO DO, TO TWEET THIS

06:32.358 --> 06:34.327
ROCK JOKE.

06:34.327 --> 06:35.795
WE MIGHT NEED TO MAKE COMEDY

06:35.795 --> 06:41.100
ILLEGAL AGAIN.

06:41.100 --> 06:43.002
NOT ONLY HAVE MULTIPLE LABOR

06:43.002 --> 06:44.971
LAWSUITS ALREADY BEEN FILED,

06:44.971 --> 06:46.038
TWITTER HAS BEEN OPERATING UNDER

06:46.038 --> 06:49.008
THE CONSENT DECREE FROM THE FTC

06:49.008 --> 06:50.209
REQUIRING SPECIAL OVERSIGHT

06:50.209 --> 06:52.612
AFTER ALLEGATIONS OF USER DATA

06:52.612 --> 06:53.946
MISUSE BUT SEVERAL KEY PEOPLE

06:53.946 --> 06:55.081
RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT OVERSIGHT

06:55.081 --> 06:59.285
ARE NOW GONE.

06:59.285 --> 07:01.020
WHILE HIS ONLINE PERSONA HAS

07:01.020 --> 07:02.755
BEEN A FUN TROLL DURING AN

07:02.755 --> 07:04.190
APPEARANCE ON MONDAY YOU GOT THE

07:04.190 --> 07:05.391
SENSE THAT THE FUND MAY HAVE

07:05.391 --> 07:07.727
WORN OFF FOR HIM.

07:07.727 --> 07:09.228
I'M REALLY WORKING THE

07:09.228 --> 07:11.330
ABSOLUTE MOST AMOUNT I CAN WORK

07:11.330 --> 07:12.632
FROM MORNING UNTIL NIGHT SEVEN

07:12.632 --> 07:15.635
DAYS A WEEK.

07:15.635 --> 07:16.702
THIS IS NOT SOMETHING I WOULD

07:16.702 --> 07:22.975
RECOMMEND, FRANKLY.

07:22.975 --> 07:25.578
YEAH.

07:27.780 --> 07:29.849
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO SAY.

07:29.849 --> 07:32.985
HOLY SHIT!

07:32.985 --> 07:35.521
THAT MAN IS IN EVERY POSSIBLE

07:35.521 --> 07:37.590
SENSE IN A VERY DARK PLACE.

07:37.590 --> 07:39.792
THE ENTIRE VIBE OF THAT VIDEO IS

07:39.792 --> 07:42.728
"WIZARD OF OZ" SUICIDE NOTE.

07:42.728 --> 07:44.730
WHO KNOWS WHAT IS GOING TO

07:44.730 --> 07:45.698
HAPPEN FROM HERE?

07:45.698 --> 07:47.967
HE CERTAINLY DOESN'T SEEM TO HE

07:47.967 --> 07:49.602
HAS DECIMATED HIS STAFF AND HIS

07:49.602 --> 07:51.237
PRODUCT, HE CAN TRY TO SELL

07:51.237 --> 07:52.471
WHAT'S LEFT OF TWITTER OR HE CAN

07:52.471 --> 07:54.607
CONTINUE FUNCTIONALLY WORSE THAN

07:54.607 --> 07:55.808
BEFORE AS A FREE-FOR-ALL DIGITAL

07:55.808 --> 07:56.809
CLOWN TOWN.

07:56.809 --> 07:57.777
THE POTENTIAL COLLAPSE OF THIS

07:57.777 --> 07:59.212
SITE HAS BEEN SAD FOR THE

07:59.212 --> 08:00.646
WORKERS AND THOSE WHO HAVE

08:00.646 --> 08:03.049
RELIED ON IT THERE IS UNDENIABLY

08:03.049 --> 08:03.649
SOMETHING A LITTLE SATISFYING

08:03.649 --> 08:06.219
ABOUT A GUY WHO WAS SO DESPERATE

08:06.219 --> 08:07.954
TO BE PERCEIVED AS COOL AND

08:07.954 --> 08:10.189
FUNNY ON THE INTERNET THAT HE

08:10.189 --> 08:11.591
PAID $44 BILLION TO MAKE IT

08:11.591 --> 08:13.559
HAPPEN ONLY TO DISCOVER THAT HE

08:13.559 --> 08:15.228
STILL SOMEHOW COULDN'T AFFORD

08:15.228 --> 08:16.195
IT.

08:16.195 --> 08:17.830
LET THAT ONE SINK IN.

08:17.830 --> 08:20.800
AND NOW, THIS.

08:20.800 --> 08:23.769
AND NOW, PEOPLE ON TV HAVE

08:23.769 --> 08:25.204
SOME THOUGHTS ON THANKSGIVING

08:25.204 --> 08:25.538
FOOD.

08:25.538 --> 08:28.808
THE SIDES, EVERYTHING ELSE

08:28.808 --> 08:31.010
INVOLVED IN THANKSGIVING.

08:31.010 --> 08:32.979
FOOTBALL, FRIENDS, FAMILY--

08:32.979 --> 08:34.013
TURKEY?

08:34.013 --> 08:34.180
NO.

08:34.180 --> 08:36.282
I LOVE ALL THE OTHER

08:36.282 --> 08:38.317
LEFTOVERS, JUST NOT THE TURKEY.

08:38.317 --> 08:40.253
IT SMELLS REALLY BAD TO ME.

08:40.253 --> 08:42.788
TURKEY TASTES LIKE DIRT, HAM

08:42.788 --> 08:43.689
TASTES LIKE SALTED DIRT.

08:43.689 --> 08:46.092
I DON'T LIKE SWEET POTATOES.

08:46.092 --> 08:49.161
I REMEMBER THAT.

08:49.161 --> 08:51.397
I'VE HEARD RECENTLY THAT SAY

08:51.397 --> 08:52.565
WHITE PEOPLE THING.

08:52.565 --> 08:54.100
I WAS GOING TO SAY THAT BUT I

08:54.100 --> 08:57.169
DIDN'T WANT TO BE OFFENSIVE.

08:57.169 --> 08:58.271
NOBODY EATS ALL THE GREEN

08:58.271 --> 09:00.139
BEAN CASSEROLE WHEN I MAKE IT.

09:00.139 --> 09:01.374
I DON'T LIKE THE FEELING ON

09:01.374 --> 09:02.975
THE ROOF OF MY MOUTH.

09:02.975 --> 09:04.277
THE ONLY THING MY KID WILL

09:04.277 --> 09:07.914
EAT ARE THE BISCUITS HE HAD

09:07.914 --> 09:08.314
THANKSGIVING FOOD.

09:08.314 --> 09:10.316
I TRIED TO.

09:10.316 --> 09:12.485
I MAKE REALLY GOOD GREEN BEAN

09:12.485 --> 09:12.985
CASSEROLE TOO.

09:12.985 --> 09:15.788

10:29.528 --> 10:30.796
SCUMBAGS, ASSORTED CRIMINALS WHO

10:30.796 --> 10:32.498
OCCASIONALLY PUT ON SOCCER

10:32.498 --> 10:32.732
MATCHES.

10:32.732 --> 10:34.934
FEVER HAS ALWAYS BEEN TERRIBLE

10:34.934 --> 10:37.136
WHICH IS WHAT MAKES IT A LITTLE

10:37.136 --> 10:38.337
HARD WHO CLAIMS THEIR EVENT

10:38.337 --> 10:40.339
ISN'T JUST ABOUT SPORT IT'S A

10:50.249 --> 10:52.618
AFTER SOME DIFFICULT TIMES.

10:52.618 --> 10:53.552
WE SHOULD NEVER UNDERESTIMATE

10:53.552 --> 10:56.789
THE UNIFYING POWER THAT

10:56.789 --> 10:57.590
SOMETHING SO UNIQUE HAS.

10:59.558 --> 11:01.961
GRANDIOSE TALK COMING FROM THE

START OF WHAT THE FUCK ARE THOSE

11:03.596 --> 11:05.164
EYEBROWS, CHARLIE BROWN?

11:05.164 --> 11:06.565
THE TRUTH IS MORE COMPLICATED

11:06.565 --> 11:07.400
THAN THAT WHICH IS NOT TO SAY I

11:07.400 --> 11:09.235
AM NOT EXCITED ABOUT THE

11:09.235 --> 11:10.770
WORLD CUP BECAUSE I AM.

LOOK FORWARD TO LEAP YEARS WITH

11:18.110 --> 11:20.579
AN ENTHUSIASM SOMEWHERE BETWEEN

11:20.579 --> 11:21.514
UNDERSTANDABLE AND HONESTLY KIND

11:21.514 --> 11:22.415
OF PATHETIC.

THEY BELIEVE SHOULD HAVE JUST

12:31.083 --> 12:32.885
KEPT TAKING HIM TO PLACES TO SEE

12:32.885 --> 12:35.855
WHAT THEY COULD GET HIM TO SAY

12:54.974 --> 12:55.875
STAGE HOSTING AN EVENT THAT

12:55.875 --> 12:57.710
EXPECTS TO ATTRACT OVER A

12:57.710 --> 12:58.344
MILLION SPECTATORS IN PERSON TO

12:58.344 --> 13:00.279
A COUNTRY JUST THE SIZE OF

13:00.279 --> 13:01.046
CONNECTICUT'S.

13:01.046 --> 13:03.182
AS YOU MAY HAVE HEARD UNDERNEATH

13:03.182 --> 13:05.384
THE PAGEANTRY AND DAVID BECKHAM

13:05.384 --> 13:07.019
DOING BAD ANTHONY BOURDAIN

13:07.019 --> 13:08.821
COSPLAY IS A MUCH DARKER STORY.

13:08.821 --> 13:10.089
SMALL SIGNS OF WHICH HAVE LEAKED

13:10.089 --> 13:11.724
OUT THIS WEEK LIKE IN THIS

13:11.724 --> 13:16.662
MOMENT FROM A DANISH REPORTER.

13:21.567 --> 13:23.802
WE ARE LIVE ON DANISH

13:23.802 --> 13:28.641
TELEVISION.

13:28.641 --> 13:31.377
YOU INVITED THE WHOLE WORLD TO

13:31.377 --> 13:33.279
COME HERE, WHY CAN'T WE FILM?

13:33.279 --> 13:36.182
IS A PUBLIC PLACE.

13:36.182 --> 13:41.720
YOU WANT TO BREAK THE CAMERA?

13:41.720 --> 13:42.054
OKAY.

13:42.054 --> 13:44.123
YOU'RE THREATENING US BY

13:44.123 --> 13:44.890
SMASHING THE CAMERA.

13:44.890 --> 13:46.759
HE WAS ASKED HOW

13:46.759 --> 13:48.027
WOULD YOU DESCRIBE WORKING

13:48.027 --> 13:49.395
CONDITIONS FOR JOURNALISTS IN

13:49.395 --> 13:51.697
THE QATAR AND SECONDS LATER A

13:51.697 --> 13:53.232
BUNCH OF GOLF CART DUNES SHOWED

13:53.232 --> 13:55.067
UP TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION FOR

13:55.067 --> 13:56.068
HIM.

13:56.068 --> 13:57.970
CREDIT TO THIS GUY FOR BEING SO

13:57.970 --> 13:59.939
EXCITED TO APPEAR ON DANISH TV

13:59.939 --> 14:03.042
THAT HE GAVE THE CAMERA A LITTLE

14:03.042 --> 14:04.310
WAVE BEFORE PRESUMABLY SMASHING

14:04.310 --> 14:05.878
THE SHIT OUT OF IT.

14:05.878 --> 14:07.513
HARASSING JOURNALISTS IS THE TIP

14:07.513 --> 14:09.248
OF THE ICEBERG HERE, ONE THAT

14:09.248 --> 14:10.983
INCLUDES A HOST OF HUMAN RIGHTS

14:10.983 --> 14:11.750
VIOLATIONS.

14:11.750 --> 14:14.119
GIVEN ALL OF THAT, TONIGHT LET'S

14:14.119 --> 14:15.921
TALK ABOUT THE QATAR WORLD CUP

14:15.921 --> 14:17.189
AND LET'S START GOING BACK TO

14:17.189 --> 14:18.390
THE MOMENT BACK IN 2012 WHEN THE

14:18.390 --> 14:20.125
WINNER OF THE BID TO HOST THIS

14:20.125 --> 14:21.994
TOURNAMENT WAS ANNOUNCED BY THE

14:21.994 --> 14:24.163
FORMER HEAD OF FIFA.

14:24.163 --> 14:32.771
THE WINNER TO ORGANIZE THE

14:32.771 --> 14:34.640
2022 FIFA WORLD CUP IS QATAR.

14:34.640 --> 14:35.975
AS A GENERAL RULE I

14:35.975 --> 14:39.411
TRIED NOT TO MAKE FUN OF OLD MEN

14:39.411 --> 14:41.013
WHO DON'T SPEAK ENGLISH AS A

14:41.013 --> 14:41.880
FIRST LANGUAGE BUT DUE TO EVIL

14:41.880 --> 14:44.917
HE IS AN EXCEPTION BUT HIM

14:44.917 --> 14:48.887
SAYING TWO, 22 WILL ALWAYS BE

14:48.887 --> 14:53.125
FUNNY TO ME.

14:53.125 --> 14:54.960
FOR REASONS FIFA WERE FULLY

14:54.960 --> 14:56.562
AWARE OF, QATAR WAS AN UNSOUND

14:56.562 --> 14:59.131
CHOICE FOR A SUMMER SOCCER

14:59.131 --> 14:59.498
TOURNAMENT.

14:59.498 --> 15:02.568
FIFA CONDUCTED ITS OWN

15:02.568 --> 15:03.569
OBJECTIVE ANALYSIS WHICH FOUND

15:03.569 --> 15:04.870
QATAR WAS AN UNSUITABLE PLACE

15:04.870 --> 15:05.871
FOR THE WORLD CUP AND A

15:05.871 --> 15:07.273
DANGEROUS PLACE TO HOLD THE

15:07.273 --> 15:07.539
WORLD CUP.

15:07.539 --> 15:10.409
SUMMER TEMPERATURES WOULD BE A

15:10.409 --> 15:11.143
HAZARD TO THE HEALTH OF PLAYERS

15:11.143 --> 15:14.780
AND THE FANS.

15:14.780 --> 15:18.117
DETHEY DIDN'T HAVE THE SPACE FOR

15:18.117 --> 15:19.351
THE STADIUM INFRASTRUCTURE THAT

15:19.351 --> 15:19.885
WAS REQUIRED.

15:19.885 --> 15:22.721
THEY WOULD HAVE TO BUILD 90

15:22.721 --> 15:23.656
NEW STADIUMS, THERE WASN'T

15:23.656 --> 15:25.057
ENOUGH ROOM FOR THEM SO THEY

15:25.057 --> 15:26.625
WOULD HAVE TO CREATE A WHOLE NEW

15:26.625 --> 15:29.194
CITY.

15:29.194 --> 15:31.163
QATAR WASN'T A

15:31.163 --> 15:32.364
SURPRISING CHOICE IT WAS

15:32.364 --> 15:32.865
LOGICALLY INEXPLICABLE.

15:32.865 --> 15:34.400
IT WOULD BE LIKE AT THE

15:34.400 --> 15:36.135
WESTMINSTER DOG SHOW AWARD OF

15:36.135 --> 15:37.469
THE BEST IN SHOW TITLE TO THE

15:37.469 --> 15:38.437
TORTOISE-- NOTHING AGAINST THAT

15:38.437 --> 15:39.805
TORTOISE BUT NOT ONLY SHOULD IT

15:39.805 --> 15:42.207
NOT HAVE WON IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN

15:42.207 --> 15:43.942
AUTOMATICALLY DISQUALIFIED.

15:43.942 --> 15:45.811
THE FIRST AND MOST OBVIOUS

15:45.811 --> 15:47.212
PROBLEM IS QATAR IS NOTORIOUSLY

15:47.212 --> 15:48.547
SCORCHING HOT IN THE SUMMER,

15:48.547 --> 15:52.751
THAT IS WHY FIFA EVENTUALLY MOVE

15:52.751 --> 15:53.952
THE WORLD CUP TO NOVEMBER BUT

15:53.952 --> 15:56.622
QATAR'S INITIAL FIRST PITCH

15:56.622 --> 15:59.158
PRETENDED HEAT WASN'T AN ISSUE

15:59.158 --> 16:00.659
PROMISING THEY WOULD BUILD

16:00.659 --> 16:02.328
OUTDOOR STADIUMS WHILE

16:02.328 --> 16:03.962
SCIENTISTS PITCHED IDEAS LIKE A

16:03.962 --> 16:04.963
MASSIVE REMOTE CONTROL

16:04.963 --> 16:07.499
ARTIFICIAL CLOUD THEY CAN MOVE

16:07.499 --> 16:10.369
AROUND TO COVER STADIUMS IN

16:10.369 --> 16:10.569
SHADE.

16:10.569 --> 16:13.539
WHICH DIDN'T EXIST AND WOULDN'T

16:13.539 --> 16:14.540
SOLVE YOUR PROBLEM ANYWAY.

16:14.540 --> 16:15.507
IT'S THE MULTIMILLION DOLLAR

16:15.507 --> 16:17.810
EQUIVALENT OF PULLING DOWN THE

16:17.810 --> 16:19.111
CAR FLAP TO KEEP THE SUN OUT OF

16:19.111 --> 16:21.280
YOUR EYES.

16:21.280 --> 16:22.848
YOU WOULD BE SURPRISED TO LEARN

16:22.848 --> 16:24.249
OF THE MANY ACCUSATIONS THAT

16:24.249 --> 16:26.852
THEY WON THEIR WORLD CUP A BIT

16:26.852 --> 16:28.287
THROUGH BRIBERY WITH ALLEGATIONS

16:28.287 --> 16:29.188
INCLUDING THREE OFFICIALS WHO

16:29.188 --> 16:31.190
AGREED TO VOTE FOR QATAR DID SO

16:31.190 --> 16:32.224
IN EXCHANGE FOR A MILLION

16:32.224 --> 16:33.926
DOLLARS EACH AND I WON'T SAY

16:33.926 --> 16:35.327
QATAR DEFINITELY GOT THE

16:35.327 --> 16:36.862
WORLD CUP THROUGH BRIBERY AND I

16:36.862 --> 16:37.696
WON'T SAY THEY DIDN'T AND I WILL

16:37.696 --> 16:43.001
SAY THAT THEY DID.

16:43.969 --> 16:45.604
AND WHILE THEY DENIED THERE WAS

16:45.604 --> 16:46.972
ANY MISCONDUCT IN THEIR BID TO

16:46.972 --> 16:48.140
THE FACT REMAINS THEY WERE GOING

16:48.140 --> 16:49.775
TO NEED TO BUILD AND NOT JUST A

16:49.775 --> 16:51.944
BUNCH OF NEW STADIUMS BUT ALSO A

16:51.944 --> 16:53.712
NEW AIRPORT, METRO SYSTEM, ROADS

16:53.712 --> 16:55.147
AND ABOUT A HUNDRED NEW HOTELS.

16:55.147 --> 16:57.149
THEY HAD TO BUILD SO MUCH NEW

16:57.149 --> 16:59.251
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT EVEN THE

16:59.251 --> 17:00.386
WORLD CUP'S MASCOT DOESN'T SEEM

17:00.386 --> 17:02.187
TO BE ABLE TO BELIEVE WHAT HIS

17:02.187 --> 17:04.790
COUNTRY HAS JUST DONE.

17:04.790 --> 17:07.159
THE FIRST THING I WANT TO

17:07.159 --> 17:08.360
SHOW YOU ARE THE STADIUMS!

17:08.360 --> 17:12.297
THE STADIUMS!

17:12.297 --> 17:13.065
IT'S MIND-BLOWING ARENAS

17:13.065 --> 17:14.099
DESIGNED BY SOME OF THE BEST

17:14.099 --> 17:17.169
ARCHITECTS IN THE WORLD.

17:17.169 --> 17:19.405
THIS IS THE SAME CITY, CAN YOU

17:19.405 --> 17:19.972
BELIEVE IT DIDN'T EXIST TEN

17:19.972 --> 17:21.673
YEARS AGO?

17:21.673 --> 17:25.144
NOW IT'S ONE OF THE CITIES

17:25.144 --> 17:25.911
HOSTING THE WORLD CUP.

17:25.911 --> 17:27.546
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT

17:27.546 --> 17:29.081
CITY WASN'T THERE TEN YEARS AGO

17:29.081 --> 17:31.183
AND IT'S A BIT ALARMING.

17:31.183 --> 17:32.651
IF YOU DROPPED BY AN EMPTY PLOT

17:32.651 --> 17:34.653
OF LAND WITH A SIGN READING

17:34.653 --> 17:35.721
COMING SOON AT TGI FRIDAY'S AND

17:35.721 --> 17:37.689
THE VERY NEXT DAY YOU SAW THE

17:37.689 --> 17:39.792
GRAND OPENING OF IT YOU WOULD

17:39.792 --> 17:40.759
HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW

17:40.759 --> 17:43.295
THE FUCK IT HAPPENED THAT FAST.

17:43.295 --> 17:44.496
ACCORDING TO ONE ESTIMATE THE

17:44.496 --> 17:47.332
GOVERNMENT HAS SPENT MORE THAN

17:47.332 --> 17:48.066
$300 BILLION ON INFO STRUCTURE

17:48.066 --> 17:49.334
PROJECTS AND THEY CAN AFFORD

17:49.334 --> 17:50.235
THAT.

17:50.235 --> 17:51.370
THEY HAVE A LOT OF MONEY THANKS

17:51.370 --> 17:52.905
TO THEIR HUGE OIL AND NATURAL

17:52.905 --> 17:53.539
GAS RESERVES.

17:53.539 --> 17:57.409
WHAT THEY DON'T HAVE A LOT OF

17:57.409 --> 17:58.510
HIS CITIZENS.

17:58.510 --> 18:00.446
NATIONALS ONLY NUMBER ABOUT

18:00.446 --> 18:01.680
380,000.

18:01.680 --> 18:03.115
HOWEVER THE COUNTRY HAS A

18:03.115 --> 18:04.650
POPULATION OF NEARLY 3 MILLION

18:04.650 --> 18:07.653
AND THAT IS BECAUSE 90% OF IT

18:07.653 --> 18:09.521
CONSIST OF FOREIGNERS AND

18:09.521 --> 18:11.056
MIGRANT WORKERS AND ITS MIGRANT

18:11.056 --> 18:12.558
WORKERS WHO PROVIDE MOST OF THE

18:12.558 --> 18:14.693
MANUAL LABOR THERE AND THOSE ARE

18:14.693 --> 18:16.662
THE ONES WHO HAD TO BUILD ALL

18:16.662 --> 18:17.729
THE NEW INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THIS

18:17.729 --> 18:18.363
TOURNAMENT WHICH BRINGS US TO

18:18.363 --> 18:22.935
ONE OF THE MAJOR SCANDALS.

18:22.935 --> 18:25.103
QATAR RECRUITED HUNDREDS OF

18:25.103 --> 18:26.872
THOUSANDS OF WORKERS MAINLY FROM

18:26.872 --> 18:28.974
INDIA, NEPAL, AND BANGLADESH NEW

18:28.974 --> 18:29.741
AGENCIES IN THEIR HOME COUNTRIES

18:29.741 --> 18:31.543
JUST TO SECURE A JOB MIGRANTS

18:31.543 --> 18:33.145
HAD LITTLE CHOICE BUT TO PAY

18:33.145 --> 18:34.713
RECRUITMENT FEES OF UP TO $4,000

18:34.713 --> 18:37.516
BEFORE THEY LEFT THE COUNTRY.

18:37.516 --> 18:39.318
ONCE THEY GOT TO QATAR, THEY

18:39.318 --> 18:40.652
WERE ALREADY IN DEBT AND TRAPPED

18:40.652 --> 18:42.955
IN A SYSTEM KNOWN IN THE

18:42.955 --> 18:44.756
MIDDLE EAST.

18:44.756 --> 18:47.559
THE SYSTEM CAN BE A FORM OF

18:47.559 --> 18:49.728
MODERN-DAY SLAVERY AND THE

18:49.728 --> 18:51.930
FEATURES OF IT AMOUNT IN SOME

18:51.930 --> 18:52.464
CASES THE FORCED LABOR.

18:52.464 --> 18:55.033
ALL THE NEW STADIUMS

18:55.033 --> 18:56.335
AND INFRASTRUCTURE WERE

18:56.335 --> 18:57.536
ESSENTIALLY BUILT THROUGH

18:57.536 --> 18:58.537
MODERN-DAY SLAVERY.

18:58.537 --> 19:01.173
WE SHOULD PROBABLY INTRODUCE A

19:01.173 --> 19:04.910
NEW COLLECTIVE NOUN, A GAGGLE OF

19:04.910 --> 19:06.512
GEESE, A POD OF WHALES, AND

19:06.512 --> 19:08.413
ATROCITY OF STADIUMS.

19:08.413 --> 19:09.748
IT EXISTS IN SOME FORM IN

19:09.748 --> 19:11.817
SEVERAL COUNTRIES IN THE

19:11.817 --> 19:13.952
MIDDLE EAST.

19:13.952 --> 19:15.020
WORKERS COME TO SWITCH JOBS OR

19:15.020 --> 19:17.723
LEAVE THE COUNTRY WITHOUT

19:17.723 --> 19:19.358
EXPLICIT CONDITION OF THEIR

19:19.358 --> 19:20.592
EMPLOYER, THEY LITERALLY HAVE

19:20.592 --> 19:21.159
THEIR PASSPORT TAKEN AWAY.

19:21.159 --> 19:26.298
BEING SO DEPENDENT ON AN

19:26.298 --> 19:27.966
EMPLOYER MEANS LABORERS EDIT

19:27.966 --> 19:29.501
VIRTUALLY NO RIGHTS.

19:29.501 --> 19:30.769
A LABORER FROM NEPAL MAINTAINS

19:30.769 --> 19:32.104
HE WAS UNDERPAID AND FOR DOING

19:32.104 --> 19:35.541
WORK IN BRUTAL CONDITIONS.

19:36.174 --> 19:39.645
I WENT TO QATAR IN 2019 ON

19:39.645 --> 19:40.746
THE 21ST OF MARCH I STARTED

19:40.746 --> 19:43.148
WORKING AT THE STADIUM.

19:43.148 --> 19:46.652
IT WAS VERY HOT, GOT UP TO

19:46.652 --> 19:47.419
52 DEGREES CELSIUS THE FIRST

19:47.419 --> 19:50.756
YEAR I WAS THERE.

19:50.756 --> 19:52.291
I USED TO SWEAT IN THE EXACT WAY

19:52.291 --> 19:54.092
AS IF IT WAS RAINING FROM THE

19:54.092 --> 19:54.393
SKY.

19:54.393 --> 19:57.229
YOU KNOW HOW HOT

19:57.229 --> 19:59.731
52 DEGREES CELSIUS IS?

19:59.731 --> 20:00.933
ITS 125 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT.

20:00.933 --> 20:02.768
IF YOU BUILD A STADIUM IN THAT

20:02.768 --> 20:03.969
HEAT YOU SHOULD GET TO OWN IT.

20:03.969 --> 20:09.341
THAT SHOULDN'T BE STADIUM, THAT

20:09.341 --> 20:10.075
SHOULD BE HIS FUCKING STADIUM

20:10.075 --> 20:11.510
AND NO ONE SHOULD BE ALLOWED

20:11.510 --> 20:13.345
INSIDE IT WITHOUT SAYING THAT

20:13.345 --> 20:14.546
OUT LOUD.

20:14.546 --> 20:15.447
THERE'S SOMETHING PRETTY FUCKED

20:15.447 --> 20:17.950
UP WITHOUT ARGUING IT'S TOO HOT

20:17.950 --> 20:19.685
FOR PEAK ATHLETES TO BE OUTSIDE

20:19.685 --> 20:20.852
FOR 90 MINUTES BUT IT'S

20:20.852 --> 20:21.520
COMPLETELY FINE TO BUILD

20:21.520 --> 20:23.055
STADIUMS AND THAT HEAT FOR HOURS

20:23.055 --> 20:24.690
A DAY AND MONTHS ON END.

20:24.690 --> 20:25.724
THAT'S NOT GETTING INTO THE

20:25.724 --> 20:27.192
LIVING CONDITIONS THEY WERE

20:27.192 --> 20:27.859
SUBJECTED TO.

20:27.859 --> 20:30.095
WE DROVE OUTSIDE THE CITY TO

20:30.095 --> 20:31.263
A PLACE THE GOVERNMENT DOESN'T

20:31.263 --> 20:34.399
WANT PEOPLE TO SEE-- THE

20:34.399 --> 20:36.335
SPRAWLING LABOR CAMPS WERE THE

20:36.335 --> 20:37.536
WORKERS ARE HOUSED.

20:37.536 --> 20:39.404
MEN WERE PACKED WALL-TO-WALL,

20:39.404 --> 20:40.372
EIGHT TO A ROOM.

20:40.372 --> 20:42.574
THE HEAT WAS STIFLING.

20:42.574 --> 20:44.109
THE KITCHEN FILTHY.

20:44.109 --> 20:45.477
THE BEDS THEY TOLD US INFESTED

20:45.477 --> 20:48.513
WITH BEDBUGS.

20:48.513 --> 20:51.116
HE LIVES HERE AMONG 150 OTHER

20:51.116 --> 20:51.550
MEN.

20:51.550 --> 20:52.684
THEY SHARED TWO BATHROOMS.

20:52.684 --> 20:54.686
THERE IS NO SHOWER HERE, KNOW

20:54.686 --> 20:55.654
WHAT TO WASH YOUR BODY, WHERE

20:55.654 --> 20:59.491
YOU WASH YOUR BODY?

20:59.491 --> 21:03.395
YOU WASH YOUR BODY IN THE TOILE

21:03.395 --> 21:03.629
TOILET?

21:03.629 --> 21:05.097
HARD TO BELIEVE BUT IN THESE

21:05.097 --> 21:05.998
CAMPS IT'S ROUTINE.

21:05.998 --> 21:08.333
AT ANOTHER CAMP OF THE TOILETS

21:08.333 --> 21:10.102
OVERFLOWED WITH SEWAGE AND TWO

21:10.102 --> 21:12.304
FILTHY KITCHENS WERE BEING

21:12.304 --> 21:12.904
SHARED BY 600 MEN.

21:12.904 --> 21:14.406
THAT IS HORRIFYING.

21:14.406 --> 21:16.575
NO ONE SHOULD EVER HAVE TO LIVE

21:16.575 --> 21:17.709
LIKE THAT-- JUST WAIT UNTIL HE

21:17.709 --> 21:22.581
FINDS OUT ABOUT THIS.

21:22.581 --> 21:23.915
YEAH, YOUR TOURNAMENT IS BUILT

21:23.915 --> 21:25.550
ON HUMAN SUFFERING, BUT HE.

21:25.550 --> 21:26.752
YOU SHOULD KNOW WHEN THAT

21:26.752 --> 21:29.521
REPORTER TALKED TO THE HEAD OF

21:29.521 --> 21:30.322
ONE OF THE LEADING SPORTS

21:30.322 --> 21:32.991
ORGANIZATIONS, IT DIDN'T GO WEL

21:32.991 --> 21:33.992
WELL.

21:33.992 --> 21:34.526
YOU GO YOURSELF AND

21:34.526 --> 21:37.029
INVESTIGATE YOU WILL SEE THEM

21:37.029 --> 21:40.332
LIVING IN A VERY COMFORTABLE,

21:40.332 --> 21:41.066
HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT.

21:41.066 --> 21:43.935
COMFORTABLE AND HEALTHY?

21:43.935 --> 21:46.138
A VERY HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT.

21:46.138 --> 21:48.340
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT WE HAVE

21:48.340 --> 21:49.741
GONE TO THE CAMPS.

21:49.741 --> 21:51.510
YOU WENT YOURSELF?

21:51.510 --> 21:53.879
THIS WEEK IN DOHA YOU HAVE

21:53.879 --> 21:54.780
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF MEN

21:54.780 --> 21:56.181
LIVING IN LABOR CAMPS.

21:56.181 --> 21:58.717
SOME OF THEM PACKED INTO SMALL

21:58.717 --> 22:00.552
ROOMS, EIGHT MEN TO A ROOM LIKE

22:00.552 --> 22:01.920
THE ONE WE SAW.

22:01.920 --> 22:03.488
TEN MEN SHARING A TOILET, NO

22:03.488 --> 22:05.023
SHOWERS, HAVE YOU BEEN TO THE

22:05.023 --> 22:06.425
LABOR CAMPS YOURSELF?

22:06.425 --> 22:08.360
I'M NOT GOING TO ANSWER

22:08.360 --> 22:08.627
QUESTIONS.

22:08.627 --> 22:10.328
YOU DON'T WANT TO ANSWER

22:10.328 --> 22:10.529
THAT.

22:10.529 --> 22:12.030
OF COURSE YOU DON'T WANT TO

22:12.030 --> 22:12.731
ANSWER THAT.

22:12.731 --> 22:15.300
WE WERE TOLD THE INTERVIEW

22:15.300 --> 22:16.168
WAS OVER.

22:16.168 --> 22:17.369
INCREDIBLE.

22:17.369 --> 22:19.137
NOTHING SAYS WORKERS LIVE IN A

22:19.137 --> 22:20.305
COMFORTABLE AND HEALTHY

22:20.305 --> 22:20.939
ENVIRONMENT QUITE LIKE LEAVING

22:20.939 --> 22:26.378
THE ROOM 30 SECONDS AFTER YOU

22:26.378 --> 22:26.945
REALIZE THE PERSON YOU'RE

22:26.945 --> 22:27.913
TALKING TO HAS SEEN THAT

22:27.913 --> 22:28.780
ENVIRONMENT.

22:28.780 --> 22:30.682
INVESTIGATION FOUND SEXY 500

22:30.682 --> 22:32.918
MIGRANT WORKERS DIED IN QATAR

22:32.918 --> 22:34.553
FROM 2102 MAX 2020.

22:34.553 --> 22:36.722
THAT NUMBER ACCOUNTS FOR ALL

22:36.722 --> 22:38.156
MIGRANT WORKER DEATHS IN QATAR,

22:38.156 --> 22:40.325
NOT JUST THOSE WHO WORKED ON

22:40.325 --> 22:41.159
STADIUMS.

22:41.159 --> 22:42.561
THE GOVERNMENT'S PREFERRED

22:42.561 --> 22:43.795
ACCOUNT SAID THERE HAD ACTUALLY

22:43.795 --> 22:45.964
ONLY BEEN 37 DEATHS AMONG

22:45.964 --> 22:47.933
LABORERS AT WORLD CUP OF

22:47.933 --> 22:49.134
STADIUMS AND ONLY THREE WERE

22:49.134 --> 22:50.702
WORK-RELATED TO.

22:50.702 --> 22:52.003
IF THAT NUMBER SEEMS

22:52.003 --> 22:53.972
SUSPICIOUSLY LOW TO YOU, IT'S

22:53.972 --> 22:56.408
BECAUSE IT VERY MUCH IS.

22:56.408 --> 22:57.075
THEIR PREFERRED ACCOUNT IS

22:57.075 --> 22:58.376
CONVENIENTLY LIMITED TO THE

22:58.376 --> 22:59.778
SMALL HANDFUL OF WORK SITES THAT

22:59.778 --> 23:01.713
WERE UNDER THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF

23:01.713 --> 23:04.449
SCRUTINY AND TO EXCLUDE THE

23:04.449 --> 23:05.283
HUNDREDS OF OTHER WORLD CUP

23:05.283 --> 23:06.518
RELATED PROJECTS.

23:06.518 --> 23:07.619
WHAT'S MORE, AUTOPSIES WEREN'T

23:07.619 --> 23:09.755
DONE ON MOST OF THESE WORKERS

23:09.755 --> 23:12.224
WITH ONE INVESTIGATION FINDING

23:12.224 --> 23:15.393
NEARLY 70% OF DEATHS OF INDIAN,

23:15.393 --> 23:17.662
NEPALI, AND BANGLADESHI

23:17.662 --> 23:21.833
NATIONALS WERE ATTRIBUTED TO

23:21.833 --> 23:23.735
NATURAL CAUSES OR CARDIAC ARREST

23:23.735 --> 23:24.936
WHICH FEELS VAGUE BECAUSE

23:24.936 --> 23:25.704
CARDIAC ARREST JUST MEANS THEIR

23:25.704 --> 23:27.906
HEART STOPPED WHICH IS LITERALLY

23:27.906 --> 23:28.774
HOW EVERYBODY DIES.

23:28.774 --> 23:30.642
I CAN TELL YOU WITH FULL

23:30.642 --> 23:32.144
CONFIDENCE THAT HIS HEART

23:32.144 --> 23:34.146
STOPPED IS BOTH HOW I AND

23:34.146 --> 23:35.580
KID ROCK WILL DIE-- THAT

23:35.580 --> 23:36.381
DOESN'T MEAN OUR CARDIAC ARREST

23:36.381 --> 23:38.216
WILL BE CAUSED BY THE SAME

23:38.216 --> 23:39.084
THING.

23:39.084 --> 23:41.253
ONE OF OUR DEATHS WILL LIKELY

23:41.253 --> 23:42.687
INVOLVE A LOT OF METH, A MONSTER

23:42.687 --> 23:44.890
TRUCK AND A VARIETY OF ILLEGAL

23:44.890 --> 23:45.157
FIREWORKS.

23:45.157 --> 23:48.927
AND THE OTHER DEATH WILL BE

23:48.927 --> 23:49.494
KID ROCK'S.

23:49.494 --> 23:51.897
QATAR WILL ARGUE THEY HAVE MADE

23:51.897 --> 23:52.531
SIGNIFICANT LABOR REFORMS IT'S

23:52.531 --> 23:54.065
SOMETHING THE HEAD OF THEIR

23:54.065 --> 23:55.400
WORLD CUP EFFORTS HAS PROUDLY

23:55.400 --> 23:55.967
BRAGGED ABOUT.

23:55.967 --> 23:58.136
IF WE LOOK AT THE ACTIONS THE

23:58.136 --> 23:59.571
GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN SO FAR,

23:59.571 --> 24:01.173
LAWS IMPLEMENTED SO FAR BEING

24:01.173 --> 24:05.911
APPLIED AS WELL.

24:05.911 --> 24:07.779
THE KAFALA SYSTEM HAS BEEN

24:07.779 --> 24:08.513
DISMANTLED.

24:08.513 --> 24:09.447
ALLOWING WORKERS TO CHANGE

24:09.447 --> 24:11.716
EMPLOYERS AND ALSO AT THE SAME

24:11.716 --> 24:14.286
TIME THERE WAS THE EXIT PERMIT

24:14.286 --> 24:14.853
SYSTEM.

24:14.853 --> 24:16.488
THEY COULDN'T LEAVE WITHOUT

24:16.488 --> 24:17.455
PERMISSION.

24:17.455 --> 24:19.057
THAT HAS BEEN DISMANTLED AS

24:19.057 --> 24:19.257
WELL.

24:19.257 --> 24:20.625
THOSE SOUND GREAT AND

24:20.625 --> 24:22.527
TO AN EXTENT THAT THEY ARE BUT

24:22.527 --> 24:24.496
THEY ALSO HAVE SOME MAJOR

24:24.496 --> 24:25.130
ASTERISKS ON THEM.

24:25.130 --> 24:26.698
WORKERS IN QATAR HAVE SAID THEY

24:26.698 --> 24:28.133
ARE STILL REQUIRED TO GET

24:28.133 --> 24:28.867
PERMISSION FROM THE CURRENT

24:28.867 --> 24:30.468
EMPLOYER BEFORE THEY CAN MOVE TO

24:30.468 --> 24:32.470
A NEW JOB AND HAVE ALSO

24:32.470 --> 24:33.305
EXPERIENCED RETALIATION FROM

24:33.305 --> 24:35.740
THEIR EMPLOYERS WHEN THEY TRY TO

24:35.740 --> 24:37.609
LEAVE BUT ALSO THE REFORMS HE'S

24:37.609 --> 24:39.811
BRAGGING ABOUT ONLY BEGAN TO BE

24:39.811 --> 24:42.314
IMPLEMENTED IN 2018 WHEN MUCH OF

24:42.314 --> 24:45.917
THE HARD WORK WAS ALREADY DONE.

24:45.917 --> 24:47.586
HE IS BRAGGING ABOUT DISMANTLING

24:47.586 --> 24:48.420
THE KAFALA SYSTEM WHILE SITTING

24:48.420 --> 24:50.055
IN A STADIUM BUILT USING IT.

24:50.055 --> 24:51.289
THE ONLY WAY THAT PAT ON THE

24:51.289 --> 24:52.924
BACK COULD HAVE BEEN MORE

24:52.924 --> 24:54.125
HYPOCRITICAL AS IF HE FORCED A

24:54.125 --> 24:57.963
MIGRANT WORKER TO DO IT FOR HIM

24:57.963 --> 24:58.496
AND 120-DEGREE HEAT.

24:58.496 --> 25:00.131
INCREDIBLY IT'S NOT JUST QATAR

25:00.131 --> 25:00.899
BRAGGING ABOUT THE PROGRESS

25:00.899 --> 25:03.835
THAT'S BEING MADE, FIFA HAS HAD

25:03.835 --> 25:05.570
THE NERVE TO CLAIM CREDIT FOR IT

25:05.570 --> 25:06.037
TOO.

25:06.037 --> 25:07.439
ALL THE CHANGES THAT HAVE

25:07.439 --> 25:08.707
HAPPENED IN THIS COUNTRY IN

25:08.707 --> 25:09.241
TERMS OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND

25:09.241 --> 25:12.844
WORKERS RIGHTS AND SO ON, HUMAN

25:12.844 --> 25:14.045
RIGHTS-- WOULD NOT HAVE

25:14.045 --> 25:15.013
HAPPENED OR CERTAINLY NOT AT THE

25:15.013 --> 25:18.416
SAME SPEED WITHOUT THE PROJECT

25:18.416 --> 25:21.887
OF THE WORLD CUP.

25:21.887 --> 25:23.889
THAT IS ONE OF A

25:23.889 --> 25:25.757
FUCKING CLAIM BECAUSE YOU CANNOT

25:25.757 --> 25:27.926
POSSIBLY ARGUE FIFA DESERVES

25:27.926 --> 25:29.160
CREDIT.

25:29.160 --> 25:31.363
THERE A VALUATION OF QATAR'S BID

25:31.363 --> 25:32.497
HAD ZERO MENTIONED OF HUMAN

25:32.497 --> 25:33.465
RIGHTS OR DEMANDS FOR LABOR

25:33.465 --> 25:33.798
REFORMS.

25:33.798 --> 25:36.167
THINK ABOUT IT LIKE THIS, IF THE

25:36.167 --> 25:39.537
COUNTRY MADE NO CHANGES TO ITS

25:39.537 --> 25:41.106
KAFALA SYSTEM AND PASSED A LAW

25:41.106 --> 25:42.340
CALLED THE DOUBLING DOWN ON

25:42.340 --> 25:44.175
SLAVE LABOR ACT OF 2019 YOU KNOW

25:44.175 --> 25:45.510
WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED?

25:45.510 --> 25:46.711
THE WORLD CUP STILL WOULD HAVE

25:46.711 --> 25:48.480
KICKED OFF IN QATAR TODAY, ISN'T

25:48.480 --> 25:49.981
THAT RIGHT?

25:49.981 --> 25:51.516
;-) IF YOU AGREE.

25:51.516 --> 25:52.918
HIM I FUCKING KNEW IT, I KNEW

25:52.918 --> 25:54.519
YOU KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON

25:54.519 --> 25:57.122
THERE.

25:57.122 --> 25:58.323
WHEN FIFA AWARDED QATAR THE

25:58.323 --> 25:59.424
WORLD CUP THERE WAS ONLY ONE WAY

25:59.424 --> 26:00.725
THE STADIUMS WERE GETTING BUILT

26:00.725 --> 26:01.459
AND THERE'S ONLY ONE GROUP OF

26:01.459 --> 26:02.360
PEOPLE WHO WERE GOING TO DO IT

26:02.360 --> 26:02.961
AND THEY GAVE THEM THE

26:02.961 --> 26:05.130
TOURNAMENT ANYWAY.

26:05.130 --> 26:06.631
THAT IS NOT THE ONLY TROUBLING

26:06.631 --> 26:08.300
THING THEY HAD TO HAVE KNOWN

26:08.300 --> 26:10.735
BACK THEN BECAUSE LET'S TAKE A

26:10.735 --> 26:13.138
LOOK AT QATAR'S HUMAN RIGHTS

26:13.138 --> 26:13.405
SITUATION.

26:13.405 --> 26:14.673
I RECOGNIZE EVERY COUNTRY HAS

26:14.673 --> 26:15.941
HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES INCLUDING

26:15.941 --> 26:16.741
THIS ONE.

26:16.741 --> 26:18.710
FOR MORE ON THAT, SEE EVERY

26:18.710 --> 26:21.246
OTHER STORY THIS SHOW HAS EVER

26:21.246 --> 26:21.680
DONE.

26:21.680 --> 26:24.115
QATAR IS IN SOME WAYS NEXT

26:24.115 --> 26:24.316
LEVEL.

26:24.316 --> 26:25.317
WOMEN HAD VERY LIMITED RIGHTS

26:25.317 --> 26:26.718
THEY NEED PERMISSION FOR THEIR

26:26.718 --> 26:29.854
MALE GUARDIANS TO MARRY, WORK IN

26:29.854 --> 26:31.323
GOVERNMENT JOBS AND TRAVEL

26:31.323 --> 26:33.325
ABROAD UNTIL CERTAIN AGES ALSO

26:33.325 --> 26:35.560
BECAUSE SEX OUTSIDE OF MARRIAGE

26:35.560 --> 26:38.163
IS ILLEGAL, PREGNANT WOMEN HAVE

26:38.163 --> 26:39.097
TO PRESENT A MARRIAGE

26:39.097 --> 26:40.231
SIGNIFICANT TO RECEIVE PRENATAL

26:40.231 --> 26:40.966
CARE WHICH I HESITATE TO TELL

26:40.966 --> 26:42.968
YOU ABOUT JUST IN CASE THE

26:42.968 --> 26:43.935
SUPREME COURT IS WATCHING THE

26:43.935 --> 26:45.904
SHOW TONIGHT AND GETTING ANY NEW

26:45.904 --> 26:47.138
IDEAS.

26:47.138 --> 26:48.773
AS FOR THE LGBT COMMUNITY,

26:48.773 --> 26:50.008
SEXUAL CONDUCT BETWEEN MEN IS

26:50.008 --> 26:51.142
CRIMINALIZED AND CAN RESULT IN

26:51.142 --> 26:54.346
SEVEN YEARS IN PRISON.

26:54.346 --> 26:56.848
FIFA WAS NOT UNAWARE OF THIS.

26:56.848 --> 26:59.150
HE JOKED ABOUT IT JUST DAYS

26:59.150 --> 27:00.118
AFTER QATAR WAS AWARDED THE

27:00.118 --> 27:01.219
TOURNAMENT WHEN HE WAS ASKED

27:01.219 --> 27:04.522
WHAT ADVICE HE WOULD GIVE TO GAY

27:04.522 --> 27:05.390
FANS WHO WANTED TO TRAVEL TO

27:05.390 --> 27:08.560
QATAR THIS WAS HIS RESPONSE.

27:08.560 --> 27:10.395
I WOULD SAY THEY SHOULD

27:10.395 --> 27:12.630
REFRAIN FROM ANY SEXUAL

27:12.630 --> 27:13.732
ACTIVITIES.

27:13.732 --> 27:15.734
THEY SAY IN COMEDY

27:15.734 --> 27:19.537
YOU CAN EITHER PUNCH UP, PUNCH

27:19.537 --> 27:20.438
DOWN, OR COSIGN OPPRESSIVE

27:20.438 --> 27:21.506
GOVERNMENTS FOR A QUICK LAUGH

27:21.506 --> 27:23.074
WHILE LOOKING LIKE THE PENGUIN

27:23.074 --> 27:25.143
WENT TO WHARTON, WE ALL KNOW

27:25.143 --> 27:26.378
WHICH OPTION HE JUST CHOSE

27:26.378 --> 27:27.245
THERE.

27:27.245 --> 27:28.613
GET THE SEPP BLATTER A NETFLIX

27:28.613 --> 27:30.715
SPECIAL IT SEEMS LIKE HE'S

27:30.715 --> 27:30.949
READY.

27:30.949 --> 27:33.351
QATAR HAS REPEATED EVERYONE IS

27:33.351 --> 27:34.819
WELCOME AT THIS WORLD CUP

27:34.819 --> 27:35.620
INCLUDING GAY FANS.

27:35.620 --> 27:38.823
BUT AS THIS GAY MAN WHO WAS

27:38.823 --> 27:39.824
GRANTED ASYLUM SIDE OF THE

27:39.824 --> 27:41.559
DANGERS HE FACED THEIR POINTS

27:41.559 --> 27:43.094
OUT EVEN IF IT IS THE CASE FOR

27:43.094 --> 27:44.996
THE NEXT FOUR WEEKS, IT'S A HELL

27:44.996 --> 27:46.598
OF A BLIND EYE TO TURN.

27:46.598 --> 27:53.038
IT'S LIKE HAVING A HOUSEHOLD

27:53.038 --> 27:55.106
WITH CHILDREN THAT ARE

27:55.106 --> 27:56.574
DOMESTICALLY ABUSED AND NOW

27:56.574 --> 27:57.442
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A FANCY

27:57.442 --> 28:00.545
DINNER PARTY.

28:00.545 --> 28:01.946
PEOPLE CAN COME IN, THEY CAN

28:01.946 --> 28:04.182
BRING THEIR KIDS, THEIR KIDS CAN

28:04.182 --> 28:05.050
JUMP ON THE TABLE AND THEY CAN

28:05.050 --> 28:07.585
DO EVERYTHING THEY WANT-- THE

28:07.585 --> 28:08.353
CHILDREN THAT LIVE THERE ARE

28:08.353 --> 28:11.356
GOING TO BE IN THE BASEMENT,

28:11.356 --> 28:14.659
QUIET, BEHAVING AND THEY CAN'T

28:14.659 --> 28:15.326
JUMP ON THE TABLE LIKE OTHER

28:15.326 --> 28:17.729
KIDS THAT VISITED.

28:17.729 --> 28:18.396
BECAUSE THEY WILL BE PUNISHED IN

28:18.396 --> 28:22.067
THAT HOUSEHOLD FOR DOING IT.

28:22.067 --> 28:24.302
NOW YOU KNOW THE CHILDREN THERE

28:24.302 --> 28:26.304
ARE ABUSED.

28:26.304 --> 28:28.773
SO HOW ARE YOU SHOWING UP TO THE

28:28.773 --> 28:28.973
HOME?

28:28.973 --> 28:31.109
EXACTLY.

28:31.109 --> 28:32.710
A QATARI GOVERNMENT IS ENGAGING

28:32.710 --> 28:34.712
IN HORRENDOUS BEHAVIOR AND WE

28:34.712 --> 28:35.280
CAN'T GLOSS OVER THAT

28:35.280 --> 28:36.681
UNCRITICALLY PUT IT IN THE

28:36.681 --> 28:37.549
SPOTLIGHT TO.

28:37.549 --> 28:40.351
IT'S AN AUTHORITARIAN REGIME,

28:40.351 --> 28:41.286
NOT MEL FUCKING GIBSON.

28:41.286 --> 28:43.188
HERE'S A FUN GAME, GUESS HOW

28:43.188 --> 28:45.190
MANY MOVIES HE'S BEEN IN THIS

28:45.190 --> 28:47.392
YEAR-- YOU'RE WRONG, IT'S

28:47.392 --> 28:47.592
SEVEN!

28:47.592 --> 28:51.463
THIS TRULY HAS BEEN THE YEAR OF

28:51.463 --> 28:51.863
MEL.

28:51.863 --> 28:53.298
THE WORKING CONDITIONS, THE

28:53.298 --> 28:55.033
OPPRESSION OF WOMEN OR

28:55.033 --> 28:56.267
GAY PEOPLE WAS A DEAL BREAKER,

28:56.267 --> 28:57.469
IN FACT THERE AUTHORITARIAN

28:57.469 --> 28:58.503
TENDENCIES MAY ACTUALLY HAVE

28:58.503 --> 29:00.905
BEEN A DEAL SWEETENER.

29:00.905 --> 29:02.874
FIFA HAS LONG HAD A SOFT SPOT

29:02.874 --> 29:03.508
FOR AUTOCRATS I'M NOT JUST

29:03.508 --> 29:05.743
SAYING THAT BECAUSE I GAVE THE

29:05.743 --> 29:07.112
THE WORLD CUP TO RUSSIA AND 2018

29:07.112 --> 29:09.881
OR WENT AHEAD WITH ONE IN

29:09.881 --> 29:10.682
ARGENTINA IN 1978 WHEN IT WAS

29:10.682 --> 29:12.550
RUN BY A MILITARY DICTATORSHIP

29:12.550 --> 29:13.218
OR EVEN THEY HELD THE SECOND

29:13.218 --> 29:15.520
WORLD CUP EVER IN MUSSOLINI'S

29:15.520 --> 29:18.857
ITALY IN 1934.

29:18.857 --> 29:21.659
THEY HAVE SET THEMSELVES, FIFA'S

29:21.659 --> 29:22.794
SECRETARY GENERAL ONCE SAID I

29:22.794 --> 29:25.096
WILL SAY SOMETHING WHICH IS

29:25.096 --> 29:27.132
CRAZY BUT LESS DEMOCRACY IS

29:27.132 --> 29:28.566
SOMETIMES BETTER FOR ORGANIZING

29:28.566 --> 29:29.701
A WORLD CUP WHEN YOU HAVE A

29:29.701 --> 29:32.070
STRONG HEAD OF STATE, THAT IS

29:32.070 --> 29:34.739
EASIER FOR US ORGANIZERS.

29:34.739 --> 29:36.574
EVEN FOR A QUOTE WHICH IS

29:36.574 --> 29:38.710
PREFACED BY "I WILL SAY

29:38.710 --> 29:40.111
SOMETHING WHICH IS CRAZY."

29:40.111 --> 29:43.948
THAT IS FUCKING NUTS!

29:43.948 --> 29:45.350
AUTHORITARIANS ARE GOOD FOR FIFA

29:45.350 --> 29:47.085
AND THIEF IS GOOD FOR

29:47.085 --> 29:48.086
AUTHORITARIANS AS THIS CRITIC

29:48.086 --> 29:49.888
POINTS OUT RUSSIA'S WORLD CUP

29:49.888 --> 29:51.556
FOUR YEARS AGO WAS PRECEDED BY A

29:51.556 --> 29:52.891
LOT OF CONTROVERSY AND CRITICISM

29:52.891 --> 29:54.759
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT PEOPLE

29:54.759 --> 29:55.560
REMEMBER ABOUT IT.

29:55.560 --> 29:57.695
HIM >> HIM WHAT WE SAW IN THE

29:57.695 --> 29:59.664
RUN UP TO 2018 WAS A LOT OF

29:59.664 --> 30:01.633
COVERAGE OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING

30:01.633 --> 30:03.735
IN RUSSIA, A LOT OF COVERAGE OF

30:03.735 --> 30:04.936
RIGHTS ABUSES A LOT OF INTEREST

30:04.936 --> 30:09.841
IN THAT AND A LOT OF ENGAGEMENT.

30:09.841 --> 30:13.745
I THINK WHAT THEY NOTICED IS HOW

30:13.745 --> 30:15.013
THAT VANISHED AS SOON AS THE

30:15.013 --> 30:16.714
FIRST WHISTLE BLEW.

30:16.714 --> 30:17.415
I THINK EVERYONE BECAME

30:17.415 --> 30:22.253
CAPTIVATED BY THE FOOTBALL.

30:22.253 --> 30:24.189
THE QATARIS KNOW IF THEY CAN GET

30:24.189 --> 30:25.590
TO THE FIRST WHISTLE THEY ARE

30:25.590 --> 30:25.924
OVER THE LINE.

30:25.924 --> 30:27.125
IT'S TRUE, SUCH AS

30:27.125 --> 30:29.694
THE POWER OF THE WORLD CUP.

30:29.694 --> 30:30.461
MEMORIES OF CONTROVERSY ARE

30:30.461 --> 30:32.897
LIKELY TO BE WASHED AWAY ONCE IT

30:32.897 --> 30:34.332
BEGINS AND INCIDENTALLY, WHAT A

30:34.332 --> 30:36.601
VIP BOX TO BE A PART OF THERE.

30:36.601 --> 30:38.970
QUICK TIP FOR THE PRESIDENT OF

30:38.970 --> 30:40.471
FIFA IF YOU'RE GOOD TO MAKE

30:40.471 --> 30:41.472
ARGUMENTS ABOUT HOW YOUR

30:41.472 --> 30:43.107
ORGANIZATION IS A GLOBAL FORCE

30:43.107 --> 30:46.010
FOR GOOD MAYBE TRY NOT TO SIT

30:46.010 --> 30:47.712
BETWEEN MOHAMMAD BIN SALMAN AND

30:47.712 --> 30:48.079
VLADIMIR PUTIN.

30:48.079 --> 30:51.449
YOU ARE THE FILLING IN A REAL

30:51.449 --> 30:52.550
SHIT SANDWICH THERE.

30:53.051 --> 30:55.353
THAT FIRST WHISTLE HAS NOW BEEN

30:55.353 --> 30:56.688
BLOWN.

30:56.688 --> 30:57.722
QATAR PLAYED ECUADOR IN THE

30:57.722 --> 30:59.090
OPENING GAME OF THE TOURNAMENT

30:59.090 --> 31:02.060
EARLIER TODAY, SO WHAT NOW?

31:02.060 --> 31:03.528
WORKERS HOPE SOME OF THE

31:03.528 --> 31:04.996
ATHLETES PARTICIPATING CAN HELP

31:04.996 --> 31:06.431
SHINE A LIGHT ON ALL THE

31:06.431 --> 31:08.733
EXPLOITATION THAT WENT INTO THIS

31:08.733 --> 31:10.868
EVENT.

31:10.868 --> 31:14.272
MY MESSAGE-- THOUSANDS OF

31:14.272 --> 31:15.607
WORKERS LIKE ME HAVE WORKED ON

31:15.607 --> 31:16.341
THE STADIUM.

31:16.341 --> 31:18.943
WE DID NOT GET OUR SALARY, OUR

31:18.943 --> 31:19.210
BENEFITS.

31:19.210 --> 31:21.112
I HOPE IF YOU TALK ABOUT WORKERS

31:21.112 --> 31:22.280
LIKE US, MAYBE WE WILL GET WHAT

31:22.280 --> 31:25.283
WE ARE OWED.

31:25.283 --> 31:28.086
I DO NOT HAVE MUCH FAITH BUT

31:28.086 --> 31:29.520
STILL I HAVE HOPE.

31:29.520 --> 31:32.457
THAT HOPE IS PRETTY

31:32.457 --> 31:33.258
MOVING, ESPECIALLY GIVEN ALL THE

31:33.258 --> 31:36.327
REASONS NOT TO HAVE ANY.

31:36.327 --> 31:38.062
I REALLY HOPE MESSI HEARS THAT

31:38.062 --> 31:39.430
MESSAGE, GIVEN THOUGH HE PLAYS

31:39.430 --> 31:44.002
PARIS ST. GERMAIN A TEAM OWNED

31:44.002 --> 31:45.470
BY THE STATE INVESTMENT FUND OF

31:45.470 --> 31:46.638
QATAR AT ONE HOLD YOUR BREATH

31:46.638 --> 31:48.506
WAITING FOR HIM TO CRITICIZE

31:48.506 --> 31:51.676
THEM, PEOPLE DON'T OPENLY SHIT

31:51.676 --> 31:53.745
ON THEIR EMPLOYERS UNLESS OF

31:53.745 --> 31:56.481
COURSE IT'S

31:56.481 --> 31:57.482
WARNER BROS.-DISCOVERY, THEY ARE

31:57.482 --> 31:59.651
TO BUSILY CANCELING SHOWS THE

31:59.651 --> 32:00.718
NOTICE.

32:00.718 --> 32:02.487
SOME PLAYERS TO THEIR CREDIT

32:02.487 --> 32:03.888
HAVE BEEN SPEAKING OUT TO.

32:03.888 --> 32:05.456
HARRY KANE AND OTHER TEAM

32:05.456 --> 32:08.059
CAPTAINS HAVE SAID THEY WILL

32:08.059 --> 32:09.994
WEAR ONE LOVE ARMBAND AND

32:09.994 --> 32:11.429
ORGANIZATIONS FROM AUSTRALIANS

32:11.429 --> 32:12.630
NATIONAL TEAM TO THE

32:12.630 --> 32:14.599
INTERNATIONAL PLAYERS UNION HAVE

32:14.599 --> 32:15.500
ISSUED STATEMENTS CONDEMNING

32:15.500 --> 32:19.170
TREATMENT OF WORKERS, WOMEN, AND

32:19.170 --> 32:19.671
GAY PEOPLE.

32:19.671 --> 32:20.672
IT'S NOT THE PLAYERS WHO ARE

32:20.672 --> 32:23.808
RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS MESS, IT'S

32:23.808 --> 32:24.008
FIFA.

32:24.008 --> 32:26.711
THEY PUT THE WORLD CUP IN QATAR

32:26.711 --> 32:27.545
AND EVERYTHING THAT HAS HAPPENED

32:27.545 --> 32:29.447
SINCE THEN HAS BEEN A COMPLETE

32:29.447 --> 32:30.515
DISGRACE.

32:30.515 --> 32:31.949
I'M NOT SAYING YOU SHOULDN'T

32:31.949 --> 32:33.651
WATCH THIS WORLD CUP OR BE

32:33.651 --> 32:34.052
EXCITED ABOUT IT.

32:34.052 --> 32:36.487
AS TOUGH AS THIS IS TO ADMIT, I

32:36.487 --> 32:38.456
WILL BE WATCHING.

32:38.456 --> 32:39.390
ONE OF MY GREATEST JOYS IS

32:39.390 --> 32:40.858
SITTING COMPLETELY ALONE IN MY

32:40.858 --> 32:43.494
LIVING ROOM AND CHEERING ON

32:43.494 --> 32:44.028
ENGLAND UNTIL THEY ARE

32:44.028 --> 32:46.130
INEVITABLY KNOCKED OUT IN THE

32:46.130 --> 32:46.964
QUARTERFINALS ON PENALTIES.

32:46.964 --> 32:49.100
LET'S TRY TO MAKE SURE A LINE IS

32:49.100 --> 32:49.767
DRAWN HERE.

32:49.767 --> 32:52.537
IN A FEW WEEKS' TIME, THE

32:52.537 --> 32:53.171
WORLD CUP WILL BE OVER.

32:53.171 --> 32:55.006
THE FINAL WHISTLE WILL BE BLOWN

32:55.006 --> 32:56.541
ON DECEMBER 18TH IN THE STADIUM

32:56.541 --> 32:59.310
THAT HE BUILT IN A CITY THAT

32:59.310 --> 33:01.512
DIDN'T EXIST TEN YEARS AGO AND

33:01.512 --> 33:02.513
FIFA WILL HAPPILY MOVE ON.

33:02.513 --> 33:04.849
THEY WILL POINT TO NEW HUMAN

33:04.849 --> 33:07.151
RIGHTS POLICIES THEY HAVE NOW

33:07.151 --> 33:09.921
ADOPTED, WE'LL SEE HOW TRULY

33:09.921 --> 33:11.556
COMMITTED TO THOSE THEY REALLY

33:11.556 --> 33:12.523
ARE ESPECIALLY ONE OF THE

33:12.523 --> 33:14.292
SUITORS TO HOST THE 2030 CUP IS

33:14.292 --> 33:15.393
RUMORED TO BE SAUDI ARABIA WHICH

33:15.393 --> 33:19.197
ALSO USES THE KAFALA SYSTEM THAT

33:19.197 --> 33:20.965
HAS A WORSE HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD

33:20.965 --> 33:21.299
THEN QATAR.

33:21.299 --> 33:23.835
THERE IS NO REASON TO BELIEVE

33:23.835 --> 33:24.502
FIFA WILL EVER DO THE RIGHT

33:24.502 --> 33:25.970
THING BUT I WOULD LOVE IT IF IT

33:25.970 --> 33:28.005
COULD FOR JUST ONCE IN ITS

33:28.005 --> 33:30.074
SHITTY HISTORY FIND A WAY TO

33:30.074 --> 33:31.709
HOLD ITSELF TO THE LOFTY IDEALS

33:31.709 --> 33:33.711
THAT IT HAS THE GALL TO PROFESS.

33:33.711 --> 33:36.114
I WOULD LOVE THAT AS MUCH AS I

33:36.114 --> 33:36.881
LOVE THE WORLD CUP ITSELF AND

33:36.881 --> 33:41.018
MAY BE, JUST, EVEN AS MUCH AS

33:41.018 --> 33:43.321
DAVID BECKHAM LOVES A TACO.

33:43.321 --> 33:45.490
BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE PERFECTION

33:45.490 --> 33:46.924
FOR ME.

33:46.924 --> 33:48.226
AND NOW, THIS.

33:48.226 --> 33:51.629
AND NOW, PEOPLE ON TV

33:51.629 --> 33:52.163
INTERROGATE THE IMPORTANT

33:52.163 --> 33:52.430
QUESTION.

33:52.430 --> 33:57.568
DO YOU SAY PECAN OR PECAN?

33:57.568 --> 34:00.872
IT'S PECAN.

34:00.872 --> 34:02.006
I WILL TRUST A SOUTHERNER ON

34:02.006 --> 34:04.041
THIS ONE.

34:04.041 --> 34:05.977
YOU DON'T LIKE PECAN PIE?

34:05.977 --> 34:11.048
IT'S PECAN.

34:11.048 --> 34:15.052
I'M GLAD YOU SAY PECAN.

34:15.052 --> 34:18.656
WE HAVE TOASTED PECANS.

34:18.656 --> 34:23.394
I SAY PECAN.

34:23.394 --> 34:25.029
FIVE END.

34:25.029 --> 34:29.300
WHAT ELSE--

34:29.300 --> 34:30.768
I SAY PECAN.

34:30.768 --> 34:31.903
OF COURSE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT

34:31.903 --> 34:34.172
TO SAY.

34:34.172 --> 34:38.443
WHO WANTS TO EAT SOMETHING

34:38.443 --> 34:39.076
CALLED THE PECAN?

34:39.076 --> 34:41.846
IT'S NOT A URINARY DEVICE.

34:41.846 --> 34:44.248
THEY ARE BOTH DELICIOUS, I

34:44.248 --> 34:46.551
DON'T CARE.

34:46.551 --> 34:48.286
I SAY THANKS SO MUCH, NOW ONE

34:48.286 --> 34:52.623
OF OUR GOOD FRIENDS--

34:52.623 --> 34:54.058
MOVING ON.

34:54.058 --> 34:56.694
BEFORE WE GO, THIS IS OUR FINAL

34:56.694 --> 34:57.728
SHOW OF THE YEAR AND FRANKLY IT

34:57.728 --> 34:59.630
HAS BEEN A TURBULENT ONE FROM

34:59.630 --> 35:02.266
BRITAIN HAVING ITS SHORTEST AND

35:02.266 --> 35:03.701
WEIRDEST SERVING PRIME MINISTER

35:03.701 --> 35:05.069
EVER TO ROE V. WADE BEING

35:05.069 --> 35:06.471
OVERTURNED, TO RUSSIA'S WAR IN

35:06.471 --> 35:07.905
UKRAINE WHICH LEST WE FORGET

35:07.905 --> 35:09.607
BEGAN BACK IN FEBRUARY WITH THE

35:09.607 --> 35:11.042
HAUNTING SOUND OF AIR RAID

35:11.042 --> 35:13.244
SIRENS AND WAS COVERED ON CNN

35:13.244 --> 35:17.982
WITH THIS JARRING MOMENT.

35:33.264 --> 35:35.733
GET FIVE BONELESS WINGS FOR

35:35.733 --> 35:37.468
$1 WITH ANY HANDCRAFTED BURGER

35:37.468 --> 35:38.102
ONLY AT APPLEBEE'S.

35:38.102 --> 35:39.871
THE POINT IS IT HAS

35:39.871 --> 35:41.305
BEEN A VERY WEIRD YEAR.

35:41.305 --> 35:43.241
THANKFULLY WE DID MANAGE TO HAVE

35:43.241 --> 35:43.908
SOME FUN.

35:43.908 --> 35:45.810
WE PRODUCED A SUBWAY SANDWICH

35:45.810 --> 35:47.612
KOREAN DRAMA, WE SENT A POLAR

35:47.612 --> 35:49.514
BEAR TO BET ON AN ICE MELTING

35:49.514 --> 35:50.581
CONTEST IN ALASKA, WE

35:50.581 --> 35:52.216
BLACKMAILED CONGRESS WITH

35:52.216 --> 35:53.150
INFORMATION WE VERY MUCH HAVE

35:53.150 --> 35:54.285
AND NICK OFFERMAN BLEW UP A

35:54.285 --> 35:56.454
TRASH CAN TO MAKE A POINT ABOUT

35:56.454 --> 35:57.121
ELECTIONS.

35:57.121 --> 35:59.724
OUR WEIRDEST MOMENT CAME WHEN WE

35:59.724 --> 36:00.825
DISCUSSED AI IMAGE GENERATORS

36:00.825 --> 36:02.693
BECAUSE YOU MAY REMEMBER WE

36:02.693 --> 36:03.160
LEARNED PEOPLE MADE A

36:03.160 --> 36:06.197
SURPRISINGLY LARGE NUMBER OF

36:06.197 --> 36:07.832
IMAGES OF ME WITH THIS GENERATOR

36:07.832 --> 36:09.700
ALONE FEATURING AROUND 500 OF

36:09.700 --> 36:09.934
THEM.

36:09.934 --> 36:11.836
WE STUMBLED ON A WHOLE SEQUENCE

36:11.836 --> 36:12.703
OF IMAGES THAT INVOLVED ME

36:12.703 --> 36:15.106
FALLING IN LOVE WITH THE CABBAGE

36:15.106 --> 36:16.340
AND MARRYING IT.

36:16.340 --> 36:18.743
SOMETHING WE RECREATE IT IN

36:18.743 --> 36:19.510
PERSON WITH STEVE BUSCEMI

36:19.510 --> 36:20.478
PRESIDING AS THE WEDDING

36:20.478 --> 36:20.912
OFFICIANT TO.

36:20.912 --> 36:22.780
I MARRIED A CABBAGE THIS YEAR

36:22.780 --> 36:26.050
AND IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL DAY.

36:26.050 --> 36:27.685
I HAVE A QUICK UPDATE BECAUSE WE

36:27.685 --> 36:28.519
CHECKED THAT THE GENERATOR SEE

36:28.519 --> 36:29.987
IF MORE IMAGES WILL BE MADE OF

36:29.987 --> 36:31.522
ME AND IT TURNS OUT THAT THEY

36:31.522 --> 36:33.858
VERY MUCH HAVE.

36:33.858 --> 36:36.460
A SEARCH FOR MY NAME ON THERE

36:36.460 --> 36:38.629
CURRENTLY RETURNS OVER 15,000

36:38.629 --> 36:39.263
RESULTS.

36:39.263 --> 36:42.266
LET ME BE VERY CLEAR, THIS HAS

36:42.266 --> 36:42.600
TO STOP.

36:42.600 --> 36:45.836
THIS SHIT IS GETTING OUT OF HAN

36:45.836 --> 36:46.237
HAND.

36:46.237 --> 36:47.505
SOME USERS ARE CONTINUING TO

36:47.505 --> 36:48.272
SPECULATE ON MY ROMANTIC

36:48.272 --> 36:51.809
EXPLOITS WITH IMAGES LIKE JOHN

36:51.809 --> 36:53.477
OLIVER IS NOW DATING A CARROT,

36:53.477 --> 36:55.346
WHILE OTHERS HAVE MOVED ON LIKE

36:55.346 --> 36:57.415
THIS ONE STARTING WITH THE

36:57.415 --> 36:58.649
PROMPT TWO RACCOONS CONDUCTING

36:58.649 --> 36:59.650
AN INTERVIEW OF JOHN OLIVER

36:59.650 --> 37:01.919
WHICH PRODUCED THIS RESULT.

37:01.919 --> 37:05.389
KUDOS WITH GOING WITH MY POINT

37:05.389 --> 37:09.260
OF VIEW IN THAT SITUATION.

37:09.260 --> 37:10.695
IT SEEMED TO BE SETTING A NEW

37:10.695 --> 37:13.297
STORY IN MOTION IT BEGINS WITH

37:13.297 --> 37:13.598
THIS PROMPT.

37:13.598 --> 37:14.498
JOHN OLIVER YOON JOHN OLIVER

37:14.498 --> 37:15.800
EUNA CYCLING TOWARDS A VERY

37:15.800 --> 37:18.035
STEEP MOUNTAINOUS HILL WHICH

37:18.035 --> 37:19.537
PROMPTED THIS ALMOST SERENE SET

37:19.537 --> 37:20.438
OF IMAGES.

37:20.438 --> 37:22.306
THERE WAS A DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE

37:22.306 --> 37:23.674
THE NEXT IMAGES WHILE UNICYCLE

37:23.674 --> 37:25.710
LINE UP A VERY STEEP MOUNTAINOUS

37:25.710 --> 37:27.345
HILL, HE REALIZES HE CAN'T

37:27.345 --> 37:28.312
UNICYCLE, DOESN'T EVER WANT TO

37:28.312 --> 37:30.548
AND NOT ONLY IS HE AFRAID OF

37:30.548 --> 37:32.416
HEIGHTS, HE LITERALLY HAS A

37:32.416 --> 37:33.918
CRIPPLING FEAR OF UNICYCLES AS

37:33.918 --> 37:35.186
HE TUMBLES DOWN THE HILL IN

37:35.186 --> 37:38.656
AGONY HE SAYS HIS TRADEMARK

37:38.656 --> 37:40.891
CATCHPHRASE "WHY DO UNICYCLES

37:40.891 --> 37:41.125
EXIST?"

37:41.125 --> 37:42.293
WHICH TO BE FAIR IS A THING I

37:42.293 --> 37:44.128
SAY ALL THE TIME TO GO THERE ARE

37:44.128 --> 37:46.964
A FEW IMAGES OF A POST-UNICYCLE

37:46.964 --> 37:48.065
ACCIDENT IN THE HOSPITAL UNTIL

37:48.065 --> 37:49.834
FINALLY THEY TYPE IN THE PROMPT

37:49.834 --> 37:51.268
AFTER RECOVERING FROM HIS

37:51.268 --> 37:52.136
UNICYCLE ACCIDENT HE RETURNS TO

37:52.136 --> 37:54.338
HIS SHOW WHAT HE DOES ONE OF

37:54.338 --> 37:55.673
THOSE WILD JOHN OLIVER HAS HBO

37:55.673 --> 37:58.209
MONEY STUNTS, I GUESS HE TIES

37:58.209 --> 37:59.343
TOGETHER A HUNDRED UNICYCLES AND

37:59.343 --> 38:01.245
PAIRS OF TWO BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT

38:01.245 --> 38:01.779
NATURE INTENDED TO.

38:01.779 --> 38:05.383
THEN THERE ARE LIKE 50 CLOWNS ON

38:05.383 --> 38:06.584
STAGE WRITING THE DANGEROUS JOHN

38:06.584 --> 38:07.785
OLIVER BY UNICYCLES THEN HE'S

38:07.785 --> 38:09.220
LIKE THAT'S OUR SHOW, SEE YOU

38:09.220 --> 38:09.987
NEXT WEEK.

38:09.987 --> 38:13.658
PICTURE IN YOUR MIND RIGHT NOW

38:13.658 --> 38:15.426
WHAT A SPECTACULAR IMAGE WOULD

38:15.426 --> 38:16.060
BE GENERATED BY THE DESCRIPTION

38:16.060 --> 38:16.427
OF THAT.

38:16.427 --> 38:19.163
DO YOU HAVE THAT IMAGE IN YOUR

38:19.163 --> 38:19.363
MIND?

38:19.363 --> 38:20.665
GOODS BECAUSE THIS IS THE IMAGE

38:20.665 --> 38:25.336
THE AI PRODUCED.

38:25.336 --> 38:26.937
VERY CLEVERLY FOCUSING ON THE

38:26.937 --> 38:28.739
SEE YOU NEXT WEEK PART OF THAT

38:28.739 --> 38:28.973
PROMPT.

38:28.973 --> 38:31.976
LOOK HOW HAPPY I LOOK THERE!

38:31.976 --> 38:35.112
IT IS SUCH A SHAME BECAUSE THE

38:35.112 --> 38:36.347
CONCEPT OF CHAOTIC CLOWNS

38:36.347 --> 38:38.015
WOBBLING AROUND DANGEROUSLY ON

38:38.015 --> 38:39.517
UNICYCLES ACTUALLY FELT LIKE A

38:39.517 --> 38:41.085
PRETTY DECENT METAPHOR THAT THE

38:41.085 --> 38:42.853
YEAR WE JUST WENT THROUGH.

38:42.853 --> 38:44.989
IT'S MESSY, IDIOTIC, A LITTLE

38:44.989 --> 38:46.857
BIT SCARY AND IT FEELS LIKE

38:46.857 --> 38:48.859
SOMEONE DIDN'T FULLY THINK IT

38:48.859 --> 38:49.093
THROUGH.

38:49.093 --> 38:50.294
IT'S FRUSTRATING NOT BEING ABLE

38:50.294 --> 38:51.896
TO SEE THAT IMAGE FOR OURSELVES,

38:51.896 --> 38:55.066
ISN'T IT?

38:55.066 --> 38:55.232
...

38:55.232 --> 38:58.636
IS SOMETHING SOMEONE MIGHT SAY

38:58.636 --> 38:59.870
IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO

38:59.870 --> 39:02.273
OUR PRODUCTION BUDGET.

39:02.273 --> 39:04.675
TO CLOSE OUT OUR SEASON, HERE IT

39:04.675 --> 39:04.909
IS!

39:04.909 --> 39:07.211
A PHYSICAL MANIFESTATION OF THE

39:07.211 --> 39:08.813
LAST YEAR!

39:08.813 --> 39:11.982
LOOK AT ALL THESE FUCKING CLOWN

39:11.982 --> 39:12.216
CLOWNS!

39:12.216 --> 39:17.354
LOOK AT THEM, LOOK AT THIS OTHER

39:17.354 --> 39:19.857
ATROCITY.

39:19.857 --> 39:21.792
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WATCHING

39:21.792 --> 39:23.027
OUR SHOW THIS YEAR.

39:23.027 --> 39:25.162

39:27.064 --> 39:28.799
THANKS TO OUR STAFF FOR WORKING

39:28.799 --> 39:29.700
SO HARD TO.

39:29.700 --> 39:31.535
HIM I DON'T LIKE THIS AT ALL

39:31.535 --> 39:33.104
THIS WAS A HUGE MISTAKE.

39:33.104 --> 39:35.473
WE WILL BE BACK NEXT FEBRUARY,

39:35.473 --> 39:38.042
PLEASE STAY SAFE UNTIL THEN.

39:38.042 --> 39:41.212
SAY IT WITH ME, WHY DO UNICYCLES

39:41.212 --> 39:41.879
EXIST?

39:41.879 --> 39:42.546
CLASSIC PHRASE.

39:42.546 --> 39:51.322
HIM SEE YOU YEAR, GOOD NIGHT!
