00:07.041 --> 00:11.777
There is a saying once a
playmate, always a playmate and
that seems to be absolutely

00:11.879 --> 00:14.246
true, but does being a playmate
really bring the success,

00:14.348 --> 00:15.547
fame and fortune that some
believes that it will?

00:16.851 --> 00:20.753
Hefner's promise was to
keep using the framework
of girl next door.

00:22.390 --> 00:26.158
You got more fame, you got more
money. Who didn't want that? The
whole philosophy.

00:27.094 --> 00:27.860
It was all a lie.

00:28.896 --> 00:30.195
It was a lifetime sentence.

00:31.799 --> 00:35.100
Playboy had an obligation
to protect us girls.

00:35.202 --> 00:37.903
I didn't sign up to do porn.
During my video, I was just
uncomfortable.

00:39.573 --> 00:43.175
I would tell them do not
go to the mansion, I would do

00:43.277 --> 00:46.078
cocaine and I'd never
dreamed that I would do that.

00:46.180 --> 00:49.548
I did not realize that I had
been sent to go have sex.

00:51.052 --> 00:54.853
The big lie was become
a playboy playmate, and

00:54.955 --> 00:57.689
you're going to have all
of your dreams come true.

01:02.396 --> 01:03.629
My name is hugh hefner, I'm
editor publisher of playboy
magazine.

01:04.832 --> 01:07.966
Hugh hefner was just
27, he fashioned himself

01:08.069 --> 01:10.235
and playboy as the face
of sexual liberation.

01:10.337 --> 01:14.973
Playboy is one of the most
famous brand names in the world.

01:15.076 --> 01:17.810
I would like to be remembered
as somebody who played some

01:17.912 --> 01:19.711
positive part in changing the
social sexual values of my time.

01:22.216 --> 01:23.782
I believe that hef pulled
one over on the whole world.

01:26.387 --> 01:30.722
The fantasy of playboy that he
created did not allow for the
consent of the women.

01:33.260 --> 01:36.295
When it came to hefner's
buddies, you had to keep those
secrets quiet.

01:36.397 --> 01:38.597
What have you got for free?

01:38.699 --> 01:43.168
When you get someone that
powerful, anything could happen.
Anything!

01:43.270 --> 01:46.438
The people who are really there,
they're the ones who know the
real truth,

01:46.540 --> 01:49.708
I want to be a voice for the
women who suffered the most at
his hands.

01:49.810 --> 02:05.757
[dramatic music]

02:07.661 --> 02:11.530
for a long time, I myself
believed the playboy promise.

02:14.001 --> 02:15.234
I was one of hefner's
best ambassadors.

02:17.404 --> 02:22.641
I was his director of
playmate promotions and it was

02:22.743 --> 02:25.110
my department's job to
keep that fantasy going.

02:27.281 --> 02:33.152
But over time, I realized that
what was supposed to be the

02:33.254 --> 02:36.588
launching pad for these
young women was really a pit.

02:39.560 --> 02:43.729
The playboy promise was
that if you signed the

02:43.831 --> 02:47.900
contract, became playmate
of the year, more fame

02:48.002 --> 02:53.205
would come to you, more money
would come to you, more glory
and job opportunities.

02:53.307 --> 02:54.173
There was no limit to what
a girl could actually do.

02:57.678 --> 03:01.914
If you get it, you have so many
doors open to you like what like
acting, modeling.

03:03.851 --> 03:07.486
What set playboy apart
from the competition was

03:07.588 --> 03:11.590
the photography in
playboy was not hardcore?

03:13.494 --> 03:17.996
It was art. Hugh hefner
celebrated the beauty of the
female

03:18.098 --> 03:21.133
body. And you had an
opportunity to be part of that.

03:21.235 --> 03:24.236
Not part of some
disgusting other magazine.

03:27.274 --> 03:29.675
I came up with a very good idea
and a lot of guys copied it.

03:29.777 --> 03:33.545
Fortunately, you
know, not as well.

03:34.815 --> 03:37.649
You know, if you look
at the original

03:37.751 --> 03:37.983
marilyn monroe picture for the
centerfold began as topless,

03:40.654 --> 03:42.087
then things started getting more
and more risquÃ© in the world.

03:43.390 --> 03:47.025
In the 70s playboy wasn't
at the vanguard anymore.

03:47.127 --> 03:50.429
Once playboy was virtually the
only magazine of its kind on the
newsstand.

03:50.531 --> 03:52.264
Now there are dozens
of imitations.

03:52.366 --> 03:56.068
Penthouse jumped the
atlantic from England in

03:56.170 --> 03:58.904
1969 with a promotion
aimed directly at playboy.

03:59.006 --> 04:01.006
It has done well but remains
a distant number two.

04:02.977 --> 04:07.579
Penthouse did full nudity and
pubic hair. Hef was a little bit
old fashioned, right?

04:07.681 --> 04:07.980
So, he had to
tune it up a notch.

04:09.984 --> 04:14.453
During the 70s hefner
became involved in what he

04:14.555 --> 04:17.256
called, and he was the one to
name it, the pubic wars.

04:19.393 --> 04:22.928
Playboy magazine and penthouse,
they were trying to compete with
each other.

04:24.431 --> 04:26.064
Now there's this debate within
playboy about how far do we go?

04:27.935 --> 04:31.770
Hef wasn't keen on actually
going pubic, if you like, but he
chose to do it.

04:33.007 --> 04:35.974
They eventually settled on we'll
show pubic hair. That's it.

04:38.612 --> 04:42.514
I was playboy's first
full frontal in 1972.

04:42.616 --> 04:43.882
It sold 7 million copies.

04:48.956 --> 04:51.456
The genie was out of the bottle.
Tastes were

04:51.558 --> 04:53.692
changing, the whole girl
next door thing wasn't

04:53.794 --> 04:56.228
flying anymore and the
competition really hurt him.

04:58.165 --> 05:01.333
Circulation that reached 7
million in 1972 has dropped to
less than 6 million.

05:02.569 --> 05:03.435
Playboy hotels and resorts
are also suffering.

05:05.973 --> 05:08.040
Penthouse was breathing
down his neck. And of

05:08.142 --> 05:10.309
course then the hustler
comes on the scene

05:10.411 --> 05:12.511
in 1974.

05:14.248 --> 05:17.215
Hustler is probably the most
uncompromising porno magazine
yet,

05:17.318 --> 05:20.052
enough to make even hugh hefner,
father of playboy, wince.

05:22.256 --> 05:26.425
Over the years, hefner walked
some kind of a line to try to

05:26.527 --> 05:29.328
keep the playmate as close as
possible to the girl next door.

05:30.898 --> 05:34.399
That's what set him apart and
these women believed in hefner.

05:34.501 --> 05:37.969
In spite of the fact,
playboy is rather tame

05:38.072 --> 05:41.373
by comparison to others,
or perhaps because

05:41.475 --> 05:44.209
of it playboy says it now has
more playmate applicants than
ever before.

05:46.313 --> 05:50.816
When I did my centerfold, in
1986, I was proud to be in
playboy,

05:52.453 --> 05:53.952
where no offense, I wouldn't
have been proud to be in
hustler.

05:55.689 --> 05:58.590
For me that was crossing a line.
Playboy was

05:58.692 --> 06:00.892
just seen at the
respectable men's magazine.

06:01.929 --> 06:05.464
The reality is,
through the 70s and 80s, playboy

06:05.566 --> 06:09.201
was becoming more
explicit, and the women

06:09.303 --> 06:09.634
were not comfortable with it.

06:12.072 --> 06:14.139
It felt like there was
a push to show more and

06:14.241 --> 06:17.008
to be a good girl and
do what you're told.

06:17.711 --> 06:18.910
Get the shot.

06:20.647 --> 06:22.781
I felt that with
my centerfold shot.

06:26.186 --> 06:29.521
I'm a small town girl from a
little desert town in
california.

06:32.326 --> 06:32.924
In the morning of my 18th
birthday, when I woke up, I was
like, I'm old enough now.

06:34.395 --> 06:36.495
I can be in playboy magazine.

06:37.798 --> 06:42.100
I knew that that modeling
was gonna get me the money

06:42.202 --> 06:43.502
so that I could actually
afford to go to college.

06:47.341 --> 06:48.306
There was no way a 19 year
old could be prepared what

06:48.409 --> 06:49.341
was gonna happen to you
once I did playboy.

06:52.546 --> 06:53.812
You know, I've been on
my own since I was 17.

06:55.949 --> 06:57.082
I had some pretty severe
sexual trauma growing up.

06:59.353 --> 07:00.919
You know, when you're on
your own as a kid, you

07:01.021 --> 07:03.588
have to take care of
yourself, which means you

07:03.690 --> 07:05.390
have to bring a
paycheck, I have bills.

07:07.895 --> 07:09.361
Shooting's my centerfold, and
they want to show pubic hair.

07:10.697 --> 07:13.532
So, I remember trying
to get the right shot.

07:13.634 --> 07:17.436
Because if I got accepted,
I would make 15,000.

07:19.173 --> 07:19.404
So, I had to get accepted.

07:21.241 --> 07:23.175
I think I signed the
contract right away.

07:25.245 --> 07:26.278
And I sat down with my mother.

07:29.817 --> 07:31.917
No, we were naive.

07:32.252 --> 07:33.151
We just did it.

07:33.253 --> 07:33.285
[laughs]

07:36.990 --> 07:39.424
it's a big deal to take your
clothes off for a camera,

07:39.526 --> 07:40.425
and a man taking the pictures.

07:42.129 --> 07:45.864
All of a sudden, one of the
makeup crew comes up and hands
you,

07:45.966 --> 07:46.998
"can you just sign this for us
because we were taking your
picture?

07:47.968 --> 07:48.900
You know, we have to
have your permission."

07:51.305 --> 07:51.703
you don't know what you're
signing, really.

07:52.806 --> 07:55.273
Sometimes you'd think they
got the girl stoned,

07:55.375 --> 07:56.408
partied out, and then they
hand her the contract.

07:58.212 --> 08:00.378
They have their ways. Through
this, you signed your life away
forever.

08:03.317 --> 08:05.784
My playboy contract came to
me when I was 17 years old.

08:07.354 --> 08:09.888
So, I really didn't take
the contract very seriously

08:09.990 --> 08:12.190
because I felt like I
still had you know control.

08:13.160 --> 08:16.661
Several playmates,
took their photos at 17

08:16.763 --> 08:19.731
years of age with the
consent of their parent.

08:23.070 --> 08:29.474
They were signing contracts in
front of either hefner or
someone of his choosing

08:29.576 --> 08:33.111
and he's holding these
photos until they are of age.

08:34.915 --> 08:40.519
I was 18 when I came to playboy,
I felt so lucky. So, I didn't
really think about like

08:41.722 --> 08:44.022
the contractual side of it and
what exactly that meant.

08:47.060 --> 08:48.660
When I was a playmate,
there were no videos.

08:49.930 --> 08:52.831
I was so nervous having to
be naked for this special

08:55.602 --> 08:57.836
and they promised that
none of it was shown

09:00.474 --> 09:02.407
this is when said I'm really
nervous about the cameras in
here in the bathtub.

09:04.444 --> 09:06.878
He said, don't worry about
it, it's all for

09:06.980 --> 09:07.445
family hour. It will all be on
the cutting room floor.

09:09.950 --> 09:12.250
But then later a friend saying,
"oh, I saw your video". I'm
like,

09:12.352 --> 09:15.787
what video? And that's when
they turned around and used that

09:15.889 --> 09:17.289
footage on the
cutting room floor.

09:21.695 --> 09:22.994
Just sit down in there and draw
bubbles all around your neck.

09:25.666 --> 09:30.669
Playboy pieced it together,
released it in cable without
telling me that it was going

09:30.771 --> 09:36.007
to be happening, not paying me
for it and that was soft porn.
They had made me a porn

09:36.109 --> 09:37.542
star against my will

09:40.981 --> 09:45.116
playboy channel was officially
launched on November 15th

09:45.218 --> 09:49.754
I think it is going
to be increasingly

09:49.856 --> 09:54.025
certainly adult but also
tastefully done. I think the
best basis for judging it is the

09:54.127 --> 09:55.694
magazine itself from the 30
years we've been publishing.

09:57.664 --> 10:02.801
In the 80s, cable had come up,
and all of a sudden, now
playmates have to do a video

10:05.005 --> 10:08.106
and we're like, what do you
mean you have to do a

10:08.208 --> 10:11.610
video? In my video, you
know, there I am waterskiing,

10:11.712 --> 10:15.714
and kite surfing and then
all of a sudden, I'm naked.

10:15.816 --> 10:20.251
A lot of us girls really
screamed and yelled about not
doing it.

10:20.354 --> 10:21.252
That was like really
crossing the line.

10:25.325 --> 10:28.994
This whole video was really
hard for me and looking

10:29.096 --> 10:31.696
back at it, I really
felt like it bordered on

10:32.332 --> 10:32.831
you know,

10:35.068 --> 10:39.638
kind of pornish and that's why
we did playboy. That's why we
didn't do penthouse.

10:39.740 --> 10:42.941
That's why we didn't do hustler.
I mean I was just uncomfortable.

10:46.046 --> 10:48.413
I was very concerned about the
women, that were doing these
videos.

10:48.515 --> 10:53.518
But the reality is,
once you sign that release

10:53.620 --> 10:58.456
you are no longer in control.
Hefner was the one in control

10:58.558 --> 10:59.224
of your image.

11:02.663 --> 11:07.165
When I was director of playmate
promotions, I wanted to reach
out and try to get these

11:07.267 --> 11:09.934
gals into some key
positions in modeling.

11:12.639 --> 11:15.640
For example, there was
one particular playmate

11:15.742 --> 11:19.844
who was very special to me.
I don't want to

11:19.946 --> 11:23.114
pinpoint her name.
I can see in her incredible

11:23.216 --> 11:26.818
possibilities. I
wanted her to be an

11:26.920 --> 11:28.620
herbal essence girl with
claire hall, I had big ideas.

11:30.757 --> 11:33.458
I got her appointment with
several different people and
took

11:33.560 --> 11:35.160
her to new york and tried to
help her make a transition.

11:36.930 --> 11:40.265
Unfortunately,
it was impossible.

11:43.470 --> 11:46.771
The companies did not want the
playmate image with their
products.

11:49.643 --> 11:52.444
Because she was a playmate, it
cut it right there. She was
already dead in the water.

11:54.614 --> 11:58.283
Playboy had become too explicit.
The stigma was way too much.

12:00.520 --> 12:02.821
As the director of
playmate promotions,

12:02.923 --> 12:07.358
I had a front seat into the
lives of many women.

12:08.328 --> 12:11.596
And I could see the
damage that happened.

12:13.600 --> 12:15.200
There were many
playmates that trusted me

12:16.536 --> 12:20.138
and I would say to them,
do not go to the mansion.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.840
There's nothing good that's
going to come from it.

12:25.278 --> 12:27.145
Something about playboy
was like sandpaper.

12:29.182 --> 12:30.915
I would go up to the mansion.
It's like when

12:32.252 --> 12:35.386
you have that feeling in
your gut that something's

12:35.489 --> 12:37.555
not right. But you can't
put your finger on it.

12:39.426 --> 12:44.896
I got the red flags, but I was
too young to understand what
they were.

12:44.998 --> 12:47.599
When is your big month?
When are we going to see it?

12:47.701 --> 12:50.635
I'm not really sure yet, they
haven't really picked them up.

12:50.737 --> 12:53.538
There were all these
playmates all under one roof

12:53.640 --> 12:56.241
and shooting to become
playmate of the year,

12:56.343 --> 12:58.076
when you do that, these girls
knew they had to wait.

13:00.313 --> 13:03.581
The system is set up that
we're gonna pay $15,000 for

13:03.683 --> 13:07.452
the centerfold, we're gonna pay
it in three intervals.

13:07.554 --> 13:10.688
When you get finished shooting.
When you get published, and one
year from

13:10.791 --> 13:12.390
your publishing date.

13:12.492 --> 13:15.627
It was 5000 when you're when
your pictorial came out.

13:17.597 --> 13:21.633
I think another 2500, when
you're done with your video.

13:21.735 --> 13:27.272
They give it to you 5000 here,
2500 here, they drag it out
because

13:27.374 --> 13:30.074
you have to fulfill your
duty before you get it all.

13:32.012 --> 13:34.646
They paid you over two years.
That's like below

13:34.748 --> 13:36.481
poverty level, it's nothing
when you think about it.

13:37.851 --> 13:40.652
You couldn't do anything
without their permission.

13:40.754 --> 13:42.687
Like if you're trying to
make money off yourself.

13:43.790 --> 13:44.489
That was a no no.

13:46.593 --> 13:52.397
While you're waiting for the
paycheck, you wait at the
mansion and you meet hef and

13:52.499 --> 13:55.900
you politic to be playmate of
the year or you politic to stay
current.

14:00.006 --> 14:03.908
In the 80s, there was a lot of
partying. It was party central.

14:06.680 --> 14:08.813
I think every girl in
the mansion say, you're

14:08.915 --> 14:10.982
expected to be at the party.
You had to be

14:11.084 --> 14:14.853
part of their scene.
It was like, well, hef's gonna

14:14.955 --> 14:18.223
want you to do that or
hef's gonna be disappointed,

14:18.325 --> 14:19.224
you know? That sort of thing.

14:20.760 --> 14:24.462
I mean, drugs and alcohol
were accepted at the

14:24.564 --> 14:28.433
playboy mansion, the playboy
parties, anybody that

14:28.535 --> 14:31.903
is put in that situation,
it can get out of hand.

14:34.941 --> 14:39.344
Because I wanted to stay thin I
would do, you know, the
occasional

14:39.446 --> 14:42.413
cocaine and I'd never ever ever
dreamed that I would do that.

14:44.718 --> 14:47.385
At the mansion,
there was a sense of everyone

14:47.487 --> 14:49.087
likes drugs, and everyone
likes to share them.

14:50.156 --> 14:53.791
I didn't start the heavy
drugs until after playboy.

14:55.295 --> 14:59.097
I lost all my teeth.
I mean you have to

14:59.199 --> 15:01.900
take a lot of drugs to do this
to yourself. So, that was a lot
of cocaine.

15:03.370 --> 15:05.003
I think the drugs definitely
played a major role

15:05.105 --> 15:09.207
in controlling and
manipulating these women.

15:09.309 --> 15:14.579
Whenever you step into the
playboy mansion and you're a new
female on the scene.

15:14.681 --> 15:20.251
Basically, you're introduced to
my father, he was hefner's best
friend and doctor to

15:20.353 --> 15:21.486
all the playmates, who of
course, would then you know,

15:22.956 --> 15:25.189
make sure that you were weighed

15:25.292 --> 15:28.893
in on a regular basis and make
sure that they were that perfect
weight.

15:32.499 --> 15:38.236
By the time I was 20, I weighed
90 pounds and ended up in
hospital.

15:38.338 --> 15:39.537
It was really hard

15:39.639 --> 15:45.710
and it took a lot of therapy
to go back to regular eating.

15:45.812 --> 15:49.747
There were a lot of girls, they
were fresh off the farm, and

15:49.849 --> 15:53.818
they felt like they had made
it and yet those same girls,

15:53.920 --> 15:59.123
months later, would go home a
skeleton, just a mere shadow of
themselves.

16:00.860 --> 16:03.494
Happened to me, this picture.
I was just skin and bones.

16:07.367 --> 16:13.204
The pull of that mansion and his
power was just way too much for
most and once they're

16:13.306 --> 16:15.373
hooked on drugs,
they're no longer in control.

16:17.811 --> 16:19.544
And when they ended up
hitting rock bottom,

16:21.247 --> 16:21.913
hefner was not going
to give them support.

16:26.586 --> 16:30.221
Specifically the girl that
I really thought was going

16:30.323 --> 16:31.589
to bridge the gap and to
the modeling industry.

16:34.527 --> 16:36.527
She just kept spiraling and she

16:36.629 --> 16:38.229
became addicted to cocaine.

16:40.367 --> 16:42.600
She was so thin that she looked
like she could die at any time.

16:44.270 --> 16:47.705
Her teeth were gray.
She needed help.

16:48.875 --> 16:52.110
I didn't want her thrown away.

16:56.916 --> 16:56.948
I wanted to save her

17:02.689 --> 17:04.422
and damn it, she
was worth saving.

17:08.094 --> 17:12.263
I was told you're not to go and
give her groceries. You're not
to pay her rent.

17:14.534 --> 17:16.968
She got herself in that mess,
and hefner doesn't want anything
to do with it.

17:17.804 --> 17:20.038
Can you imagine that?

17:22.475 --> 17:25.977
After all the money he made off
of that girl, he didn't want to
feed her.

17:27.814 --> 17:28.913
[bleep] shame on
that son of a bitch.

17:36.956 --> 17:38.523
I did it. I did it anyway.

17:44.030 --> 17:46.364
I begged her to go back
home and she did it.

17:49.269 --> 17:52.770
I almost got fired several
times for doing what I did.

17:53.907 --> 17:58.476
Years ago when I was at the
house, at the mansion,

17:58.578 --> 18:01.879
hef told me to be careful
because miki was

18:01.981 --> 18:02.914
crazy and dangerous.

18:04.417 --> 18:08.186
He didn't want the girls talking
to her because she was stirring
up

18:08.288 --> 18:11.122
trouble. She was pointing
things out that he

18:11.224 --> 18:13.391
didn't want pointed out
and he was losing control.

18:16.930 --> 18:22.366
I'd become mother confessor to
many women and I felt a
responsibility. But I realized

18:25.839 --> 18:26.270
I was fighting a losing battle.

18:28.575 --> 18:33.544
I could not handle it anymore.
When I left playboy in 1982,

18:34.781 --> 18:38.583
I didn't think the situation
could get any worse. But it did.

18:42.989 --> 18:48.226
I had worked hard to change the
way that playmate promotions

18:48.328 --> 18:52.263
handled their women.
How they made sure that they

18:52.365 --> 18:56.868
had safety that anytime anything
happened, they were able to
report it.

18:58.872 --> 19:01.139
It wasn't an easy job. Many
of the executives, they were

19:01.241 --> 19:04.475
only interested in protecting
playboy and hugh hefner.

19:06.779 --> 19:09.447
Like valerie cragin with
the playboy model agency.

19:11.551 --> 19:13.484
At first, valerie cragin
kind of took care of

19:13.586 --> 19:16.554
me. She taught me a lot
because I came from a

19:16.656 --> 19:20.158
small town and so,
like, she would take me

19:20.260 --> 19:22.560
shopping and she would
take me to nice restaurants

19:22.662 --> 19:24.395
and I learned proper etiquette.

19:25.565 --> 19:28.266
She was kind to me, and she
made sure that I got work.

19:30.103 --> 19:32.870
But certain girls were getting
a hell of a lot more work.

19:34.307 --> 19:37.608
I was like, how in the hell
are you getting that much work?

19:39.012 --> 19:41.579
Valerie cragin was a
pimp for hugh hefner.

19:43.550 --> 19:48.119
She and I went at it a lot.
The playboy modeling agency

19:48.221 --> 19:52.223
was a place where women could be
invited to the mansion for the
parties.

19:54.227 --> 19:56.360
I didn't want any part of it.

19:59.132 --> 20:05.303
1982 after I left playboy,
valerie cragin took over the
planning promotions

20:05.405 --> 20:09.040
department and at that point in
time, it became what I
considered flesh peddling.

20:12.378 --> 20:13.911
Valerie cragin was head
of playmate promotions,

20:14.013 --> 20:17.014
when I began.
Playmate promotions, those were

20:17.116 --> 20:18.749
the girls who went out
and they signed autographs

20:18.851 --> 20:21.185
and did all that there
was good money there.

20:21.287 --> 20:22.253
So, this was my income.

20:23.890 --> 20:24.822
The first few years of
promotions were rough.

20:27.594 --> 20:30.895
They started doing some stuff
with casinos. They would

20:30.997 --> 20:34.465
fly us in with the high
rollers and we do little

20:34.567 --> 20:40.371
fashion shows and then they'd
say, go on down and gamble with
the high rollers.

20:40.473 --> 20:41.973
The guys were kind of like which
ones do this and which girls do
that?

20:43.276 --> 20:45.843
It was like, they were pimping
us out a little bit.

20:50.116 --> 20:53.217
Oh, yeah. I had a playmate
I was rooming with,

20:53.319 --> 20:56.487
I was back in my bed
and two guys held the

20:56.589 --> 21:00.391
door open and she just stood
there and she changed her
clothes halfway in the hall and

21:00.493 --> 21:02.493
there's $100 bills literally
flying all over the

21:02.595 --> 21:03.995
place but she worked hard
for those last night.

21:06.666 --> 21:09.767
There was this one trip to
atlantic city for playmate
promotions.

21:09.869 --> 21:11.535
It was like 20 guys,

21:11.638 --> 21:13.904
they wanted to take a picture
with us in this hot tub.

21:15.041 --> 21:19.010
He is like, get in here,
I paid for you. Really!

21:19.112 --> 21:21.112
As if we were prostitutes and
it was gross, you know.

21:22.148 --> 21:23.447
It was gross.

21:27.487 --> 21:30.554
When I was working for
playmate promotions,

21:30.657 --> 21:31.789
I was sent out to do a job,
which turned out

21:34.294 --> 21:39.563
to be non-existent. I was
actually just being sent there
to go on a date.

21:41.134 --> 21:44.502
So, I flew to texas to do this

21:44.604 --> 21:48.205
big truck calendar for this guy
who owned oil companies.

21:49.542 --> 21:52.143
I showed up and then I
realized this is not real.

21:55.081 --> 21:59.016
I remember barricading myself in
the room and putting the chair

21:59.118 --> 22:02.620
underneath the door. I called
playboy and I was like, you got
to get me

22:02.722 --> 22:02.953
out of here, this isn't real.
This isn't happening.

22:06.759 --> 22:08.859
It was valerie cragin
on the other end of

22:08.961 --> 22:12.163
the line saying,

22:12.265 --> 22:14.565
first, valerie gragin says
oh my gosh, let me look

22:14.667 --> 22:19.136
into it and then she calls
me back and says, what

22:19.238 --> 22:22.173
we're understanding is that the
client is very upset with you
because you are the one

22:22.275 --> 22:22.440
who has acted inappropriately.

22:26.312 --> 22:29.980
Valerie cragin, boy, she was
an incredible manipulator.

22:30.983 --> 22:33.851
She knew everybody's
business where they were,

22:35.221 --> 22:38.856
what they would do.
I just- she made my skin crawl.

22:42.362 --> 22:46.764
The second incident was they
made promotion, sent me to
alaska

22:46.866 --> 22:50.267
to model and it turned out
that there was no modeling gig.

22:52.505 --> 22:56.040
I ended up driving all around
alaska with this guy

22:56.142 --> 22:58.209
and I get dropped off
and I go home.

23:01.447 --> 23:05.716
Then he came looking for me
later, he found out where I
live. I honestly

23:05.818 --> 23:06.717
don't know everything that
happened, he drugged me.

23:09.756 --> 23:11.122
I don't know,
what did he do to me?

23:17.497 --> 23:17.795
He did a lot of really
horrific things.

23:22.335 --> 23:24.502
When that was over,
when I finally got away from

23:24.604 --> 23:27.338
him, I went right to
playboy's security

23:29.776 --> 23:31.308
team and I told them about it.

23:32.712 --> 23:34.211
I didn't have to testify.
I didn't have to do

23:34.313 --> 23:36.647
anything. They took care of it.
That's all I know.

23:38.217 --> 23:41.051
As playmates we get
put in situations

23:43.923 --> 23:49.393
that are almost impossible to
get out of without conceding.

23:53.266 --> 23:54.498
Playboy was dangerous to women.

23:56.869 --> 24:03.207
Playboy ruined women's lives and
I was going to stop it any way I
could.

24:05.711 --> 24:09.013
This administration is putting
the purveyors of illegal
obscenity and child

24:09.115 --> 24:11.949
pornography on notice. Your
industries days are numbered.

24:12.185 --> 24:15.319
[clapping]

24:15.421 --> 24:19.056
the 80s were a backlash
to the 70s because the

24:19.158 --> 24:21.058
70s was all free love and
the sexual revolution.

24:24.664 --> 24:26.964
After the pubic wars, people
were afraid of what was
happening culturally.

24:29.502 --> 24:32.636
The pornography problem in this
country is a front burner issue
with moral majority,

24:34.006 --> 24:36.674
and moral majority will continue
to deal with that issue.

24:38.444 --> 24:43.514
The religious right was
constantly raining down on
playboy talking about how we
were

24:43.616 --> 24:46.517
influencing in american
culture towards hell.

24:48.588 --> 24:51.922
In 1985, edwin meese
was the attorney general

24:52.024 --> 24:55.559
under the reagan administration
who came up with the commission
against pornography

24:57.063 --> 24:59.997
because of the influence
of the religious right.

25:00.099 --> 25:04.068
One of the first things edwin
meese did when becoming attorney
general

25:04.170 --> 25:05.569
was to launch a new study of
pornography, a study to
determine

25:05.671 --> 25:09.073
if there was a demonstrable
cause and effect

25:09.175 --> 25:11.509
between dirty books, movies,
etc, and dirty crimes.

25:13.579 --> 25:16.447
The commission did a
series of hearings around

25:16.549 --> 25:18.782
the country discussing
pornography and its

25:18.885 --> 25:22.052
bad influences on culture.

25:22.154 --> 25:24.455
We demand that the
commission acknowledged that

25:24.557 --> 25:26.257
the $8 billion a year
pornography industry

25:26.359 --> 25:29.927
is built on the sexual
enslavement and exploitation of
women,

25:30.863 --> 25:34.665
playboy always
differentiated itself from

25:34.767 --> 25:39.703
straight up porn, but with
the meese commission,

25:39.805 --> 25:42.506
suddenly we were being lumped
together with penthouse

25:42.608 --> 25:45.509
and hustler by the religious
right by the feminist.

25:46.913 --> 25:49.713
We went from a very
repressive, conservative

25:49.815 --> 25:53.183
time in the 50s and we
are back once again,

25:53.286 --> 25:57.388
to some extent, in a
conservative posture again.

25:57.490 --> 25:59.456
So, obviously,
playboy and I personally

25:59.559 --> 26:02.927
have an easy target.

26:03.029 --> 26:06.597
Hef thought the meese
commission was persecution and

26:06.699 --> 26:09.133
thought it was [bleep], and
playboy was clearly targeted.

26:11.604 --> 26:18.375
In 1985, a religious group
contacted me and asked me if I
would participate and tell my

26:18.477 --> 26:22.813
story and testify at
the meese commission.

26:24.383 --> 26:27.985
She was miss January of
1973, and served as

26:28.087 --> 26:31.088
director of playmates
promotions from 1976 to 1982.

26:32.925 --> 26:36.694
Now saying she fears that going
public will put her life and the
lives of her family

26:36.796 --> 26:39.997
in danger, miki garcia has
come forward with what she

26:40.099 --> 26:42.132
claims as the inside story
of playboy's playmates,

26:44.303 --> 26:46.704
I knew that he was terrified of
my testimony because he sent so
many people

26:48.274 --> 26:51.542
to me to come shut me up.

26:53.946 --> 26:56.814
I wasn't about to accept the
silence that he was threatening
me with.

26:58.351 --> 27:00.317
And I didn't care
that I was scared.

27:00.419 --> 27:02.653
Appearing before the
us attorney general's

27:02.755 --> 27:05.189
commission on pornography,
garcia said playmates

27:05.291 --> 27:06.957
often came to see her
complaining of being pressured

27:07.059 --> 27:08.092
into doing things they
didn't want to do,

27:10.296 --> 27:12.062
sometimes by playboy
publisher hugh hefner himself.

27:12.732 --> 27:16.100
Miki testified against playboy.

27:16.202 --> 27:20.270
She stood up against a lot
of threats. She had to have

27:20.373 --> 27:25.576
a bodyguard and some other girls
were gonna testify with her and
they bailed on her.

27:30.916 --> 27:36.153
Talking to miki garcia, miki,
you spoke before the attorney
general's commission on

27:36.255 --> 27:39.556
pornography.
What really goes on in playboy?

27:39.659 --> 27:43.027
Well, what happens once
the girl is introduced

27:43.129 --> 27:46.497
into the system in,
I do call it a system.

27:46.599 --> 27:49.033
She is then subjected to a lot
of things beyond her control.

27:51.103 --> 27:53.804
I said what was happening
to the women, that

27:53.906 --> 27:55.706
they were being coerced
into terrible things.

27:57.476 --> 27:59.043
I testified about drugs,

28:01.514 --> 28:08.519
rape, abuse, coercion. Many
things that young woman should
not be subjected to.

28:09.755 --> 28:12.723
At playboy mansion west,
hefner and his staff

28:12.825 --> 28:14.558
encouraged playmates
to use illegal drugs.

28:16.095 --> 28:16.727
How much is hefner
involved in the drug use?

28:19.498 --> 28:20.064
It's his home isn't it?

28:22.435 --> 28:23.534
But he claims that if there
isn't anything, he's unaware of
it?

28:25.805 --> 28:27.271
Well, the man has to be deaf,
dumb and blind and I think
hefner is not.

28:29.075 --> 28:33.177
I wanted to be able to stop
this kind of abuse of women.

28:34.780 --> 28:38.716
Many of the playmates would come
to me and say, I'm doing the
photo session, I'm

28:38.818 --> 28:44.121
embarrassed. I didn't realize
that the photos were going to be
so explicit.

28:44.223 --> 28:47.324
I talked about contracts that
were totally unfair. He trapped
us.

28:49.795 --> 28:50.194
He made sure he had
all of the rights.

28:52.998 --> 28:56.400
There was an archive on
each of us not just what

28:56.502 --> 28:59.470
is published through the year
or there might be volumes more.

29:00.773 --> 29:02.906
She has no editorial
control over those photos.

29:04.677 --> 29:07.644
She always has this lurking
in her background, that at any

29:07.747 --> 29:10.581
time the magazine could pull
out one of those pictures.

29:10.683 --> 29:12.683
Garcia said the centerfold
layouts create the

29:12.785 --> 29:14.785
impression that the
models are promiscuous.

29:14.887 --> 29:18.222
I talked about playmate
promotions, selling sex.

29:18.324 --> 29:21.625
When she travels on playmate
promotions, she is out there.

29:21.727 --> 29:25.329
She's in open for sexual
harassment. She knows that if
she reports

29:25.431 --> 29:30.300
this to playboy, that it will
fall on deaf ears, or that maybe
they'll take the action

29:30.402 --> 29:31.268
where she can no
longer work again.

29:32.571 --> 29:35.339
I had power when I testified
at the meese commission,

29:35.441 --> 29:38.408
I had power and I knew it.

29:38.511 --> 29:41.979
In a written response, playboy
called garcia's allegations,
false statements.

29:42.081 --> 29:46.150
I am sure that he was
constipated for 10 years after I
testified

29:47.787 --> 29:48.452
and I loved every minute of it.

29:52.591 --> 29:54.358
The press covered my testimony.

29:55.861 --> 29:56.860
I had a voice.

29:58.597 --> 30:03.534
I want the public to start
asking hugh hefner some very
serious questions.

30:03.636 --> 30:06.336
I did not have the support
of any women, not the

30:06.438 --> 30:10.641
women I protected, and not the
women I worked with at playboy,

30:10.743 --> 30:11.275
the female executives.

30:12.845 --> 30:13.811
It was a huge decision
for me to come forward.

30:15.948 --> 30:17.815
No one wanted the truth
out, nobody.

30:20.119 --> 30:23.620
I went in there and
said, wake up america.

30:23.722 --> 30:27.024
Do not buy that piece of crap.
Don't be fooled by

30:27.126 --> 30:28.659
this man and he needs to
be brought to justice.

30:30.196 --> 30:31.228
He took it for granted
that he would be able

30:31.330 --> 30:34.231
to control us and that he
could get away with it.

30:37.736 --> 30:38.936
The attorney general's
commission on pornography

30:39.038 --> 30:40.571
will issue its final
report today.

30:40.673 --> 30:43.106
The meese commission today
called for picketing and

30:43.209 --> 30:46.443
boycotting stores that sell
hard and soft-core pornography.

30:46.545 --> 30:48.412
Meese commission was very
effective in hurting playboy.

30:49.849 --> 30:52.416
You can get adult magazines
on street corners, but

30:52.518 --> 30:55.185
not in 8000 convenience
stores around the country

30:55.287 --> 30:59.223
in September 1986, my small town
could not get my issue of

30:59.325 --> 31:02.226
playboy on the newsstand
because of the meese commission.

31:04.230 --> 31:06.797
They said you can't have that
smut magazine in the front of a

31:06.899 --> 31:08.832
store for anybody to
just walk up and see.

31:10.669 --> 31:13.971
My testimony did have an impact.
Playboy was

31:14.073 --> 31:16.840
no longer welcomed in
convenience stores and

31:16.942 --> 31:18.108
and that was big revenue.

31:19.745 --> 31:27.117
I did financially impact him
and I was happy, very happy

31:27.219 --> 31:29.586
1000s of 7elevens and other
stores removed the magazines
from their shelves.

31:31.390 --> 31:33.257
Sales figures are not in yet,
but a drop is anticipated.

31:35.294 --> 31:37.928
If half of your circulation is
from magazine rack sales,

31:38.030 --> 31:39.463
and all of a sudden you can't

31:39.565 --> 31:41.832
be on a magazine rack anymore,
it's a serious effect.

31:43.202 --> 31:46.570
There is politics behind
all of this. I think

31:46.672 --> 31:49.406
that the appeal to right
wing fundamentalist

31:49.508 --> 31:55.612
is what lies behind much of
this kind of nonsense going on.

31:55.714 --> 32:01.919
Of course hefner started suing
and eventually edwin meese had
to backpedal.

32:02.021 --> 32:05.055
Absolutely, it's hurt us, I mean
there's no way that it couldn't
have hurt us.

32:05.157 --> 32:06.790
Playboy is suing attorney
general meese and the
commission.

32:08.460 --> 32:12.930
When it was over and the review
was done. They went back up on
the shelves, but they

32:13.032 --> 32:13.597
were wrapped at that point.

32:15.901 --> 32:20.637
So, the magazine became more
subscribable. But at the end of
the day, they won.

32:21.774 --> 32:22.339
Playboy always won.

32:24.176 --> 32:26.810
A group of right wing
zealots, even in the justice

32:26.912 --> 32:27.945
department cannot
override the constitution

32:28.047 --> 32:30.647
and this is still
a free society.

32:32.451 --> 32:35.752
[clapping]

32:35.854 --> 32:40.290
tonight, our playmate of the
year is a 21 year old lady

32:43.295 --> 32:48.165
from north carolina with her
parents here, church going
baptists, as she is,

32:49.935 --> 32:55.272
after the meese commission, the
powers that be were definitely
much more conservative.

32:57.409 --> 33:01.845
Playboy understood that so
playmate of the year was from
the bible belt.

33:01.947 --> 33:03.947
Supposedly she was a virgin,
you know, it was political.

33:05.084 --> 33:06.850
Our playmate of the
year, donna edmondson

33:06.952 --> 33:09.653
[clapping]

33:09.755 --> 33:13.190
in late 80s, after the meese
commission, of course,

33:13.292 --> 33:16.727
the party line was,
it didn't affect us at all.

33:16.829 --> 33:19.930
This was part of hefner's
brilliance, it was spinning it

33:20.032 --> 33:22.666
but it was really fraught
time of change for playboy.

33:25.070 --> 33:32.609
There was also aids coming in
the 80s. Aids being this
mysterious disease that

33:32.711 --> 33:35.779
people didn't understand. People
were like sex, it's all that
sex.

33:41.487 --> 33:44.755
When aids came in,
it freaked people out, but it

33:44.857 --> 33:47.257
didn't really hit people
until rebecca got sick.

33:49.828 --> 33:52.362
Rebecca armstrong, she was the
first playmate that had aids.

33:54.967 --> 33:59.536
When I tested positive in
1989, I was only 22 years old.

34:01.874 --> 34:03.874
I lied actually to playboy when

34:03.976 --> 34:07.110
I was getting sick.
But I didn't just stop

34:07.212 --> 34:10.347
working and then I went
full blown aids within

34:10.449 --> 34:12.115
like what? Three
and a half years

34:12.217 --> 34:15.585
and that's when I went to
playboy and told them.

34:16.588 --> 34:18.922
Hugh hefner's reaction

34:19.525 --> 34:20.090
was really amazing.

34:23.095 --> 34:27.297
He stepped right up to the
plate. He said, you know, sex
isn't the enemy

34:29.701 --> 34:29.733
aids is the enemy.

34:32.971 --> 34:37.207
Playboy gave me a platform,
shooting videos about hiv
awareness.

34:37.309 --> 34:39.976
I'm rebecca armstrong,
and I am one of more

34:40.079 --> 34:42.012
than a million americans
living with hiv today.

34:43.315 --> 34:46.616
And it opened up doors
that would not have been

34:46.718 --> 34:47.317
open, had I not posed
for playboy magazine.

34:49.388 --> 34:54.491
I also had to educate people at
playboy. I was one of their own.

34:56.595 --> 34:57.861
Has aids, knocked the playboy
philosophy on the head?

35:00.632 --> 35:01.731
Not if you properly understand
what the playboy

35:01.834 --> 35:04.434
philosophy is all about
because playboy established

35:04.536 --> 35:05.936
from the very outset.

35:06.038 --> 35:09.372
The fact that we really had to
take a fresh look at the ethics
and

35:10.442 --> 35:13.043
morality of sexuality,
something that we've never

35:13.145 --> 35:13.543
really bothered to do
in western civilization

35:16.315 --> 35:17.514
and obviously, aids becomes one
of the important elements in all
of that.

35:20.786 --> 35:24.955
Hef did the interviews and you
saw more articles about hiv
being written in playboy?

35:26.425 --> 35:29.126
He did not shy away from making
sure that people knew about this
disease.

35:33.866 --> 35:37.634
No, life at the mansion
didn't change. No way.

35:41.607 --> 35:48.979
After my diagnosis, I remember
asking the doctor how long do I
have and he

35:49.081 --> 35:52.415
said, well, I honestly can't
tell you but maybe a year or
two.

35:55.220 --> 35:59.022
So, the dreams that I had
of going to school and

35:59.124 --> 36:01.892
becoming a lawyer or a
psychologist that was gone

36:03.328 --> 36:05.762
and it's a really
really frightening time.

36:07.866 --> 36:11.635
I started self-medicating and
drinking every single day and
then I got

36:12.538 --> 36:14.004
really sick and ended
up in the hospital

36:16.875 --> 36:18.708
and I still don't know
exactly how I contracted it.

36:28.720 --> 36:29.286
I don't know.

36:32.591 --> 36:34.925
I honestly don't know everything
that happened, he drugged me.

36:40.999 --> 36:41.665
No.

36:52.244 --> 36:53.810
And I can't even believe I'm
saying it right now but yeah.

37:00.485 --> 37:04.487
But I can't hang on to the what
if, it will make me not be able
to sleep at night.

37:12.664 --> 37:15.465
There may have been a rebecca
in the past that would

37:15.567 --> 37:19.869
have been filled with anger but
I try not to allow that to
poison me anymore.

37:20.572 --> 37:21.037
Do I think

37:25.110 --> 37:27.744
some parties that worked
there are scumbags? Yeah!

37:33.518 --> 37:34.384
You get the idea of what
we're supposed to be doing.

37:35.954 --> 37:38.955
I want you to have a lot of
life in front of the camera and

37:39.057 --> 37:39.656
communicate with the camera.
Let's go ahead and try your now,
honey.

37:51.003 --> 37:56.172
Valerie cragin, the world is not
a lesser place because of her
death.

37:58.110 --> 38:00.877
I mean I remember long
after I did playboy,

38:03.048 --> 38:08.051
I went to a restaurant and I saw
her and I just know I turned
white.

38:08.153 --> 38:11.454
I know I just turned white and I
turned around really quickly and
got out of there.

38:15.027 --> 38:20.096
The big lie that playboy was
telling was "become a playboy

38:20.198 --> 38:23.199
playmate and you're going to
have all your dreams come true".

38:25.671 --> 38:27.170
I was angry, I was pissed.

38:29.841 --> 38:32.208
How do we allow this to happen?

38:32.311 --> 38:35.645
And why do we withhold
the truth so that more

38:35.747 --> 38:38.982
women every month send
their photos into playboy

38:39.084 --> 38:42.585
magazine seeking to be a
centerfold for all the wrong
reasons?

38:44.122 --> 38:45.622
Playboy is not what
they read about.

38:47.292 --> 38:49.826
It was a far more sinister world
and that's what I wanted
everyone to know

38:49.928 --> 38:52.062
and I did it.

38:53.532 --> 38:58.335
And after I testified, I really
thought that maybe it would
stop.

38:59.471 --> 39:03.807
Maybe women would stop
signing the damn contracts.

39:03.909 --> 39:06.409
Maybe they would stop
going to the mansion.

39:07.312 --> 39:09.879
Maybe hefner would
have to get a real job

39:13.552 --> 39:14.718
and stop making this money
off of the backs of women.

39:17.823 --> 39:20.957
Hefner's biggest push right now
is the adult video market.

39:21.059 --> 39:22.225
The company is replacing its

39:22.327 --> 39:25.962
money losing playboy channel
with a pay per view network.

39:26.064 --> 39:28.998
His promise was to always
protect us and keep

39:29.101 --> 39:31.267
us within the framework
of girl next door,

39:32.337 --> 39:36.940
he lied. The playmate
contract gave hefner and

39:37.042 --> 39:41.177
playboy the right to use
the photos and the filming

39:41.279 --> 39:44.080
in any media that he saw fit.

39:45.150 --> 39:47.984
The stock is selling
at an all-time high and

39:48.086 --> 39:51.221
much of what began with
magazine has expanded

39:51.323 --> 39:53.556
now because the internet and
it's just a tremendous exciting
time

39:54.092 --> 39:55.091
hefner sold us.

39:56.661 --> 40:01.231
He took our photos and put
them on hardcore porn sites.

40:02.801 --> 40:06.269
My name is attached to every
porn site you can imagine.
That's (bleep).

40:08.173 --> 40:09.973
Playboy had an obligation
to protect us girls,

40:10.075 --> 40:12.409
especially with our
photos and videos.

40:13.979 --> 40:16.012
They just open floodgates and
let them go, it was all about
the money.

40:18.216 --> 40:23.620
The playboy fantasy would
still go on, because hefner

40:23.722 --> 40:27.590
simply knew what sold and
what sold was playboy.

40:29.728 --> 40:33.329
There are people that want
to keep hef's secrets.

40:34.900 --> 40:36.099
I was breaking the code.

40:37.803 --> 40:38.334
Just don't tell.

40:40.739 --> 40:44.841
You don't tell but I did
and I don't regret it.

41:19.945 --> 41:22.946
I remember paige as being
a happy person and then

41:23.048 --> 41:25.949
she shot herself in the head.
What happened?

41:28.253 --> 41:32.655
I think the paige young's story
reveals the dark side of the
playboy mansion scene.

41:32.757 --> 41:36.860
A number of the allegations
against bill cosby have

41:36.962 --> 41:38.528
involved stories that took
place at the playboy mansion.

41:40.565 --> 41:43.533
There were a lot of
powerful people in hollywood

41:43.635 --> 41:46.536
that the women in playboy
shouldn't have gone with.

41:46.638 --> 41:49.172
Paige believed that
these men were predatory,

41:49.274 --> 41:53.209
especially hugh hefner.
You're not going to win

41:53.311 --> 41:54.911
a game against
rich important men.
