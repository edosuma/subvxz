WEBVTT

00:07.517 --> 00:08.379
Trawler,
this is yacht The Blue.

00:08.448 --> 00:09.793
Hey, what did you find?

00:09.862 --> 00:11.896
There's also
something else in the bag.

00:11.965 --> 00:14.689
I reckon they're worth
maybe 1, 1 1/2 mil.

00:14.758 --> 00:16.344
Aaron, this is
a serious business.

00:16.413 --> 00:17.758
If Aaron's right,
we've stolen this

00:17.827 --> 00:19.137
from a drug trafficking
operation.

00:19.206 --> 00:22.344
With that money,
with those diamonds,

00:22.413 --> 00:23.724
we could disappear.

00:23.793 --> 00:25.275
We'd be safe.
Shh.

00:25.344 --> 00:27.137
I don't think
they can hear us in here.

00:27.206 --> 00:29.448
- What are you after?
- I don't know.

00:29.517 --> 00:30.689
Hey!
He robbed me.

00:30.758 --> 00:31.931
He pushed me down, and I--
What?

00:32.000 --> 00:33.517
Where? Where'd he go?
Oh!

00:33.586 --> 00:35.103
He took our passports.

00:35.172 --> 00:36.413
You think we can trust them?

00:36.482 --> 00:37.758
It's not them
I'm worried about.

00:37.827 --> 00:39.448
Are you still wearing that?

00:41.413 --> 00:43.103
Where were you?
What about the money?

00:43.172 --> 00:44.310
It doesn't matter.

00:44.379 --> 00:45.896
Nothing matters.
We're finished.

00:48.862 --> 00:50.896
He's got this idea
that there was something dodgy

00:50.965 --> 00:52.689
about that money we found.
It was a setup.

00:52.758 --> 00:54.896
- Was it?
- I don't know.

00:54.965 --> 00:56.551
You think any of the crew
had a grudge

00:56.620 --> 00:57.965
against Aaron Winbourne?

00:58.034 --> 00:59.068
Aaron's dead.

00:59.137 --> 01:00.379
His throat was slashed.

01:00.448 --> 01:05.379
He was murdered.

01:26.724 --> 01:29.206
We're done here for now.
It's all yours.

01:29.275 --> 01:30.551
Thanks, mate.

01:49.275 --> 01:50.689
Those holes?

01:52.103 --> 01:53.689
Bullets.

01:53.758 --> 01:55.620
At least a dozen of them.

01:55.689 --> 01:58.068
Seems like
someone shot the place up.

01:58.137 --> 01:59.862
Traces of blood, too,
on the deck.

02:02.137 --> 02:04.172
We'll start below,
if that's OK with you.

02:13.862 --> 02:16.620
Oh, and we'll be recording
the whole walkaround.

02:16.689 --> 02:17.965
Sorry.
I should have warned you.

03:04.310 --> 03:05.586
It's gonna be OK.

03:05.655 --> 03:07.862
How?

03:07.931 --> 03:10.413
Well, our plan still works.

03:10.482 --> 03:12.275
We know where the money is,

03:12.344 --> 03:14.793
so I'm sure we'll get
another chance to grab it soon.

03:17.344 --> 03:18.965
Where are we gonna go
without passports?

03:19.034 --> 03:21.000
I don't know.
I don't know.

03:21.068 --> 03:23.068
I haven't thought of that yet,
but I will.

03:27.103 --> 03:28.068
Where were you?

03:29.620 --> 03:31.862
You said we'd meet at midnight,
and you weren't there.

03:31.931 --> 03:33.275
- I know. I know.
- And I waited for you!

03:33.344 --> 03:35.103
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

03:35.172 --> 03:37.103
Denny showed up.

03:37.172 --> 03:39.448
And I was gonna try and leave.

03:39.517 --> 03:40.689
But then I thought
if I waited,

03:40.758 --> 03:41.793
I would be able
to slip the bag past him.

03:41.862 --> 03:44.068
And then, it didn't happen.

03:44.137 --> 03:46.448
Fucking Aaron
is gonna kill us.

03:46.517 --> 03:47.689
He's gonna kill us
when he realizes

03:47.758 --> 03:49.793
we don't have any passports.

03:49.862 --> 03:51.862
So that's great.
Yeah.

03:51.931 --> 03:54.137
And we can't get off the boat
without them anyway.

03:56.724 --> 03:58.448
Where are you going?
Oh, this is my fault.

03:58.517 --> 04:01.241
So I'm gonna sort it.

04:18.172 --> 04:21.448
♪ All the things
that I ran from ♪

04:21.517 --> 04:27.586
♪ I now bring as close
to me as I can ♪

04:27.655 --> 04:32.724
♪ Ripping hotel sheets
with gritted teeth ♪

04:32.793 --> 04:35.724
♪ My montage of lost things ♪

04:35.793 --> 04:40.896
♪ My shiny ♪

04:40.965 --> 04:44.724
♪ Trinkets of grief ♪

04:53.172 --> 04:54.275
Where's Denny?

04:54.344 --> 04:56.517
Went down the beach
for a swim.

04:56.586 --> 04:57.758
Kitty all right?

04:57.827 --> 04:59.482
Yeah, just fine.

04:59.551 --> 05:01.862
Sleeping. Hungover.

05:17.241 --> 05:19.137
Can you talk?

05:19.206 --> 05:20.206
Yeah.

05:39.137 --> 05:41.137
Is there anything
you want to tell me?

05:43.344 --> 05:44.344
About what?

05:46.586 --> 05:48.551
Maybe the fact that
you've been bullshitting us

05:48.620 --> 05:50.344
since the first day we met.

05:52.482 --> 05:53.965
I didn't bullshit anyone.

05:56.413 --> 05:58.724
No, wait.

06:05.724 --> 06:07.517
Go on.

06:22.965 --> 06:24.448
Here, your part.

06:24.517 --> 06:27.000
How much, mecano?

06:27.068 --> 06:30.034
Mecano?
Oh, let me.

06:31.896 --> 06:35.724
This, 22,600.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.206
OK. OK, kuya.

06:44.103 --> 06:47.517
You know, it's bad luck to
spend money on New Year's Day.

06:54.689 --> 06:55.655
What did he say?

06:55.724 --> 06:57.655
He says there's...

06:57.724 --> 06:59.448
plenty of bad luck
around already.

06:59.517 --> 07:00.689
No, no, no.

07:00.758 --> 07:02.344
He said something else
about police.

07:03.689 --> 07:06.827
They've been
searching boats all around,

07:06.896 --> 07:08.758
especially foreign boats.

07:08.827 --> 07:10.275
Why?
Why are they searching boats?

07:10.344 --> 07:11.862
Who knows, man?

07:11.931 --> 07:15.655
But if they didn't get to you
yet, they'll be coming soon.

07:15.724 --> 07:18.344
Like he said, bad luck.

07:47.793 --> 07:50.758
OK.

07:50.827 --> 07:53.275
Uh-huh.

07:53.344 --> 07:54.448
Oi, your change!

07:54.517 --> 07:56.379
No, it's OK! OK! OK!
Keep! Keep!

08:02.448 --> 08:03.655
You know, before this,

08:03.724 --> 08:05.413
me and Lana hadn't
really been anywhere.

08:05.482 --> 08:07.344
We grew up in foster care.
That's how we met.

08:07.413 --> 08:12.034
And we always had
this big dream

08:12.103 --> 08:15.172
that we'd travel together.

08:16.586 --> 08:17.517
And?

08:21.896 --> 08:25.034
And we used some...

08:25.103 --> 08:27.793
stolen credit cards.

08:31.896 --> 08:35.620
You mean
you stole credit cards?

08:35.689 --> 08:37.862
What about my wallet?

08:37.931 --> 08:40.344
Did you steal that too?

08:48.931 --> 08:50.310
Shit.

09:11.827 --> 09:13.137
Fuck.

09:22.689 --> 09:24.586
- Shell?
- In here.

09:28.068 --> 09:29.379
You've got
to come and see this.

09:45.206 --> 09:46.379
- Aaron?
- Hey.

09:46.448 --> 09:48.275
Hey, the cops
are searching boats.

09:48.344 --> 09:50.241
You need to dump the money
and the diamonds right now.

09:50.310 --> 09:53.137
But I don't even fucking know
where you hid it.

09:53.206 --> 09:54.206
Just go down in--

09:55.517 --> 09:57.034
Aaron? Aaron?

09:57.103 --> 09:58.241
Just do it, OK?

09:58.310 --> 10:00.379
- The signal.
- Shell.

10:00.448 --> 10:01.724
Shell?

10:04.379 --> 10:05.862
- Stop.
- Where are you going?

10:05.931 --> 10:08.724
Aaron?

10:08.793 --> 10:10.689
Fucking phones.
Hey, you.

10:10.758 --> 10:12.931
You own this boat?

10:20.620 --> 10:22.655
My boat, The Blue.

10:22.724 --> 10:24.379
Macau. Macau.

10:26.689 --> 10:28.758
Salamat. Salamat.

10:28.827 --> 10:30.586
Thank you, Chief.
Thank you.

10:56.965 --> 10:58.241
Salt water.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.137
It's good for injuries.

11:04.137 --> 11:05.965
Says who?

11:06.034 --> 11:09.172
My dad.

11:09.241 --> 11:10.448
But then,
most of what he said

11:10.517 --> 11:13.379
turned out to be bullshit,
so...

11:18.344 --> 11:19.586
I've got a bit of a problem.

11:22.172 --> 11:25.206
Mine and Kitty's passports
have been stolen.

11:26.655 --> 11:28.000
It shouldn't be hard
to replace them.

11:28.068 --> 11:29.965
Just go to the consular office.

11:30.034 --> 11:32.034
Can't do that.

11:38.827 --> 11:40.620
So what's your plan?

11:43.413 --> 11:47.586
Well, I know that you said
you had friends in Balakot.

11:47.655 --> 11:49.827
I thought that
they might be able to help.

11:49.896 --> 11:54.000
Help, like you want me
to get you dodgy passports?

11:54.068 --> 11:55.689
Do I look like Tony Soprano?

11:57.241 --> 11:59.241
Look, it's fine.
You don't have to help.

11:59.310 --> 12:03.379
I just thought I would ask.
No.

12:03.448 --> 12:07.000
There is someone I can ask.

12:07.068 --> 12:08.586
This boat is
private property.

12:08.655 --> 12:10.551
You don't have permission
to board.

12:10.620 --> 12:13.068
Apologies.
Are you the captain?

12:13.137 --> 12:15.034
No, I'm a...

12:16.827 --> 12:18.103
Passenger, but--

12:18.172 --> 12:19.448
So where's the captain?

12:24.344 --> 12:25.586
That you, my friend?

12:27.862 --> 12:30.517
Because I have a very serious
matter to discuss with him.

12:30.586 --> 12:31.827
Hey!

12:31.896 --> 12:33.137
Hey, hey, hey.

12:35.034 --> 12:37.068
What's going on?
This is my yacht.

12:40.137 --> 12:42.000
Name?

12:42.068 --> 12:44.034
Uh, Aaron Winbourne.

12:44.103 --> 12:47.034
Captain Dizon,
Philippine Police Service.

12:47.103 --> 12:48.965
Your passenger has
already made it clear

12:49.034 --> 12:50.620
that we are not wanted here,

12:50.689 --> 12:53.517
but I'm afraid
I have a warrant...

12:56.793 --> 13:00.379
Empowering us to search
all boats in Balakot.

13:06.206 --> 13:07.448
Fine. Search.

13:22.068 --> 13:25.275
I also need to look
at your logbook,

13:25.344 --> 13:29.586
crew rosters, and passports...

13:29.655 --> 13:31.482
for all passengers.

13:48.275 --> 13:49.724
Show passport.

13:58.068 --> 14:00.413
You've been
to many places, huh?

14:00.482 --> 14:02.241
Yeah. What's the point
of having your own boat

14:02.310 --> 14:04.551
if you don't use it?

14:04.620 --> 14:07.379
Three days ago,
all the way out to Sagisag

14:07.448 --> 14:09.206
and then straight back?

14:09.275 --> 14:12.413
Yeah, we just did
a bit of snorkeling.

14:13.689 --> 14:17.310
I'm interested,
because three days ago,

14:17.379 --> 14:21.000
something happened not so far
from Sagisag.

14:21.068 --> 14:23.172
Captain.

14:23.241 --> 14:25.068
No passport.

14:33.310 --> 14:35.448
No papers?

14:35.517 --> 14:41.103
Well, my passport got stolen
at a party last night.

14:41.172 --> 14:43.241
Did you file a police report?

14:44.758 --> 14:48.137
I was meaning to,
but no, not yet.

14:57.586 --> 15:02.068
Crew without documentation
is a very serious thing.

15:38.241 --> 15:42.482
So we're assuming that this
is Aaron Winbourne's cabin.

15:44.000 --> 15:44.965
Yep.

15:51.413 --> 15:55.206
Actually,
quite a lot of blood in here.

15:55.275 --> 15:56.931
Any idea
what he keeps in there?

15:57.000 --> 15:58.379
Uh-uh.

16:03.724 --> 16:05.724
So what do we think
might be inside?

16:05.793 --> 16:08.137
I mean, come on.

16:08.206 --> 16:10.758
We have tried to cooperate
here, and I think--

16:10.827 --> 16:15.448
Well,
please continue to cooperate.

17:35.655 --> 17:38.827
Well, I can explain the cash.

17:40.137 --> 17:42.413
I'm glad

17:42.482 --> 17:45.862
'cause this is a lot of money.

17:45.931 --> 17:49.137
Yeah, I was planning
on purchasing another boat

17:49.206 --> 17:50.310
while I was out here,

17:50.379 --> 17:52.448
and the seller requested cash.

17:52.517 --> 17:53.551
So where'd it come from?

17:53.620 --> 17:55.689
You bring it from Australia?

17:58.275 --> 18:01.379
Yeah, that's right.

18:01.448 --> 18:02.689
In pesos?

18:04.758 --> 18:07.413
That is
what the vendor requested.

18:11.655 --> 18:14.068
I'm sorry, but this boat
is to be impounded.

18:14.137 --> 18:17.068
Your passports will be held.
No, wait--

18:17.137 --> 18:18.862
And all of you come back,

18:18.931 --> 18:20.827
answer more questions
from my boss.

18:34.620 --> 18:36.034
No, wait.

18:36.103 --> 18:37.655
This is a mistake.

18:39.724 --> 18:41.275
This is a misunderstanding.

18:41.344 --> 18:45.586
I mean, we're leaving
the Philippines anyway, so...

18:45.655 --> 18:49.896
what do you say
we make good on our mistakes?

18:52.172 --> 18:53.482
"Make good"?

19:05.517 --> 19:07.965
You can take the cash,

19:08.034 --> 19:10.275
call it a fine for my friend
being undocumented,

19:10.344 --> 19:12.724
and we'd go on our way.

19:12.793 --> 19:15.137
Never say anything.

19:15.206 --> 19:17.551
Can't to anyone.

19:23.551 --> 19:25.275
Put the money in the bag.

19:53.620 --> 19:56.793
We're thinking this is
Michelle Wilson's cabin.

19:56.862 --> 20:01.034
And Dennis Winbourne's.

20:01.103 --> 20:05.034
Stop me if do you see
anything suspicious here.

20:07.103 --> 20:10.896
This was my cabin
when I was here.

20:10.965 --> 20:12.551
You OK?
You want a minute?

20:21.206 --> 20:24.517
Well, it looks like
someone else has moved in.

20:24.586 --> 20:26.586
The place is a bit of a mess.

20:26.655 --> 20:28.620
Seems like they were
looking for something.

20:28.689 --> 20:31.551
Perhaps our mystery guest.

20:31.620 --> 20:32.862
Then there's this.

20:56.482 --> 20:59.206
What's he doing?

21:01.034 --> 21:04.379
He wouldn't snitch,
would he?

21:11.965 --> 21:16.000
I want you out
of Balakot today.

21:16.068 --> 21:17.793
Otherwise,
my boss will come visit you,

21:17.862 --> 21:22.413
and I don't think
you'll like him as much as me.

21:22.482 --> 21:24.551
Move.

21:24.620 --> 21:27.241
Sir, yes, sir.

21:39.137 --> 21:41.551
We all good?
We in the clear?

21:41.620 --> 21:43.931
For now, I think maybe so.

21:47.275 --> 21:49.206
But where are the diamonds?

21:49.275 --> 21:53.551
What I want to know is,
where the fuck is my brother?

22:00.241 --> 22:03.620
So last night
you found Kitty all right?

22:03.689 --> 22:05.827
Eventually.

22:05.896 --> 22:08.586
Sorry if I made you late.

22:08.655 --> 22:11.620
No, it's fine.

22:11.689 --> 22:13.000
I just knew she'd be waiting.

22:13.068 --> 22:14.931
I didn't want her
to be on her own.

22:22.034 --> 22:24.172
What about you?
You speak to Aaron?

22:24.241 --> 22:27.034
No. No, he didn't come back
to the boat last night.

22:31.034 --> 22:34.793
To tell you the truth,
I was pretty fucking relieved.

22:39.034 --> 22:42.103
The guy that we're gonna see,
who is he?

22:42.172 --> 22:43.965
Do you remember
my old weed dealer?

22:44.034 --> 22:45.344
Same guy.

22:45.413 --> 22:47.586
So at least if we strike out
on the passports,

22:47.655 --> 22:50.000
we can smoke some pot.

22:51.965 --> 22:53.689
Maybe it was just
a coincidence.

22:53.758 --> 22:55.793
Who's to say the police were
even looking for the diamonds?

22:55.862 --> 22:57.275
They were looking.

22:57.344 --> 23:01.689
Mentioned an incident
near Sagisag three days ago.

23:01.758 --> 23:03.517
I fudged the logs
to put us further away,

23:03.586 --> 23:06.344
but it's the same general area
we found the fucking bag.

23:06.413 --> 23:08.758
- And the same day we found it.
- OK.

23:08.827 --> 23:11.379
If it was drugs,
or a dead drop, or whatever,

23:11.448 --> 23:13.758
then how would the police
even know about that?

23:13.827 --> 23:15.034
The police here,

23:15.103 --> 23:16.689
they're probably the ones
selling the drugs.

23:16.758 --> 23:18.896
We don't know
what that bag was.

23:18.965 --> 23:20.724
That's been the problem
from the beginning.

23:20.793 --> 23:22.517
Hey, Shell.
Please, come on.

23:22.586 --> 23:23.758
Stop.
We're not rehashing this.

23:23.827 --> 23:26.379
We just need find
to Lana and Denny.

23:26.448 --> 23:28.344
They're gone, man.

23:28.413 --> 23:30.310
With the diamonds.

23:30.379 --> 23:32.068
No.

23:32.137 --> 23:33.862
She wouldn't leave without me.

23:33.931 --> 23:35.965
Oh, I don't care
either way, OK?

23:36.034 --> 23:39.655
If they're not back soon,
we're out of here.

23:39.724 --> 23:41.206
What? No.

23:41.275 --> 23:43.379
Mate, can I have a word
with you, please?

23:43.448 --> 23:45.724
Aaron? No, you got--

23:45.793 --> 23:47.586
Aaron! Fuck's sake!

24:05.551 --> 24:10.344
The last few days, I've been
in a pretty bad place,

24:10.413 --> 24:13.241
and I wasn't fair on you.

24:13.310 --> 24:15.068
I'm sorry, OK?

24:15.137 --> 24:17.241
I'll do better next time.

24:19.827 --> 24:21.206
Forgive me?

24:23.896 --> 24:27.103
I believe you, yeah.

24:27.172 --> 24:28.965
Sure.

24:29.034 --> 24:31.620
How long until we get
this engine fixed, hmm?

24:31.689 --> 24:33.655
If I worked with you?

24:33.724 --> 24:36.896
Three hours.

24:36.965 --> 24:38.344
Maybe four.

24:38.413 --> 24:39.827
Not sure.

24:39.896 --> 24:42.862
OK.

24:47.655 --> 24:50.344
Aaron, I know
the other two just joined us,

24:50.413 --> 24:52.344
but Denny, man,
we can't just leave him here.

24:52.413 --> 24:54.241
Shell, I saw
the search warrant, OK?

24:54.310 --> 24:57.793
It was issued under
Filipino anti-terrorist law.

24:57.862 --> 24:59.551
- Anti-terrorist?
- Yeah, anti-terrorist.

24:59.620 --> 25:01.827
No right to trial, no defense.

25:01.896 --> 25:03.448
We'd basically
just disappear, OK?

25:03.517 --> 25:05.931
So when I say that
we need to get out of here,

25:06.000 --> 25:08.482
it's because
I actually mean it.

25:11.620 --> 25:13.275
I'm gonna go find Lana.

25:13.344 --> 25:14.896
Kitty.

25:14.965 --> 25:16.310
Kitty, you'll never find her.

25:16.379 --> 25:18.827
You don't even know
your way around this town.

25:20.931 --> 25:23.034
I will take her.

25:25.620 --> 25:27.551
All right, fine.

25:27.620 --> 25:30.068
Once that engine's fixed,
we are out of here,

25:30.137 --> 25:32.000
whether you are back or not.

25:58.965 --> 26:00.896
You good?

26:00.965 --> 26:02.310
Uh, yeah.

26:08.758 --> 26:10.620
You want to come up?

26:10.689 --> 26:13.689
You don't want me
to wait down here by myself?

26:13.758 --> 26:15.137
All right.

26:37.896 --> 26:39.379
How far is it?

26:45.758 --> 26:47.586
Come on. This way.

26:53.275 --> 26:55.379
Is that some sort
of New Year's Day thing?

26:55.448 --> 26:58.448
No. New Year's Day is usually
quiet in the Philippines.

27:00.517 --> 27:02.344
Where are
all these people going then?

27:02.413 --> 27:06.000
And why all the photos
and flowers?

27:07.517 --> 27:08.689
Wait.

27:10.655 --> 27:13.103
Weren't we meant to be
heading towards the market?

27:13.172 --> 27:14.965
Just follow me.

27:15.034 --> 27:15.862
But that's
where you said they--

27:15.931 --> 27:17.310
Come on.

27:33.620 --> 27:35.137
No. No, no, no.

27:35.206 --> 27:37.137
There's police here.

27:37.206 --> 27:39.551
They're not interested in us.

28:09.448 --> 28:11.103
Hello?

28:16.068 --> 28:17.655
Navarro?

28:25.793 --> 28:28.000
There he is.

28:30.137 --> 28:32.000
Mate?

28:32.068 --> 28:34.931
Oh, fuck!

28:35.000 --> 28:36.034
What?

28:36.103 --> 28:37.758
Hey.
No, Lana, don't. Don't.

28:43.827 --> 28:46.103
Jesus Christ.

29:04.379 --> 29:06.551
Denny.
Denny, they're still here.

29:06.620 --> 29:08.896
We need to leave
before they find us.

29:10.793 --> 29:12.379
Fuck.

29:12.448 --> 29:14.000
Oh fuck.

29:20.206 --> 29:23.103
Hey, bedroom.

29:56.068 --> 29:57.965
Hey!

29:58.034 --> 29:59.137
Hey!

29:59.206 --> 30:00.137
- Go!
- Hey!

30:09.965 --> 30:11.275
Oh, shit.

30:16.482 --> 30:18.206
Hey, stop!
Where are you going?

30:18.275 --> 30:19.655
God, run!

30:22.655 --> 30:24.241
Shit, mate!

30:33.137 --> 30:35.275
Hey!

31:17.137 --> 31:19.206
Is this a funeral?

31:33.034 --> 31:34.896
Come on. This way.

31:43.586 --> 31:45.206
Who's that boy
in the picture?

31:47.551 --> 31:49.724
Did that policeman
tell you anything?

31:49.793 --> 31:52.379
Joseph?
Joseph, what's happening?

31:52.448 --> 31:55.103
It's a funeral.
That's all I know.

32:33.793 --> 32:34.758
Shit.

32:34.827 --> 32:35.862
Come on. In here.

33:03.931 --> 33:05.931
Excuse me.

33:08.068 --> 33:10.310
We need to get out of here.
We need to find Lana now.

33:10.379 --> 33:11.827
Yeah, yeah.

33:14.965 --> 33:16.448
Excuse me, my guy.

33:16.517 --> 33:18.413
The boy, what happened to him?

33:24.379 --> 33:25.586
- God.
- What did he say?

33:25.655 --> 33:27.344
What did he say?
We need to go now.

33:27.413 --> 33:30.448
It's not safe here.

33:30.517 --> 33:32.344
Fucking hell.

33:52.482 --> 33:53.965
He's still there.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.379
Oh, fuck.

34:00.448 --> 34:02.827
What the fuck's happening?

34:02.896 --> 34:04.413
No witnesses.

34:04.482 --> 34:07.241
They killed him.
We saw him.

34:07.310 --> 34:09.827
But why would they do that
to anyone who sells weed?

34:36.724 --> 34:38.310
Kitty?

34:38.379 --> 34:40.517
Kitty? Kitty?

34:40.586 --> 34:42.068
Fucking hell!

34:43.655 --> 34:46.758
Kitty, stay with me!
Joseph!

34:55.172 --> 34:57.344
Oh, fuck.
There's a train.

34:57.413 --> 34:58.724
There's a train.
We should use it as cover.

34:58.793 --> 35:00.379
Yeah.

35:13.206 --> 35:15.965
- Go, go!
- Go, go, go!

35:25.068 --> 35:26.965
Joseph!

35:30.482 --> 35:32.275
Joseph!

35:32.344 --> 35:34.413
- Where?
- There! There!

35:34.482 --> 35:36.103
Go! Go! Catch up!
Hey!

35:38.793 --> 35:40.965
Hey, down here! Go!

35:56.862 --> 35:59.758
You guys,
make enough room!

35:59.827 --> 36:01.517
Joseph!

36:01.586 --> 36:03.724
Joseph! Joseph!

36:05.655 --> 36:07.068
- Kitty!
- Come on!

36:07.137 --> 36:08.689
Please, take my hand!

36:23.620 --> 36:25.793
This is not a place
for tourists.

36:25.862 --> 36:26.758
Go.

36:45.103 --> 36:47.655
How the fuck are we
gonna get to Kapalon now?

36:47.724 --> 36:50.793
Forget it.
We're not.

36:50.862 --> 36:53.517
No.
No, you promised you'd take me.

36:53.586 --> 36:55.206
We're going back to The Blue.

36:55.275 --> 36:58.344
It's way too dangerous here.

36:58.413 --> 36:59.758
What did that guy say to you?

37:03.000 --> 37:04.068
Huh?

37:12.482 --> 37:13.551
Stop looking back.

37:13.620 --> 37:16.448
We're almost at the pier.

37:16.517 --> 37:17.827
OK.

37:24.827 --> 37:26.724
Oh, shit.
Go, go, go!

37:29.068 --> 37:30.137
Go, go!

37:46.448 --> 37:48.034
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
The fuck?

37:48.103 --> 37:49.827
Shit!

37:49.896 --> 37:51.862
All right, just keep going!
Go, go!

37:53.586 --> 37:55.000
Hey, hey, hey!

37:55.068 --> 37:56.551
I need to get back
to my boat.

37:59.379 --> 38:01.482
Australian.

38:01.551 --> 38:03.275
Hey!

38:03.344 --> 38:05.068
Where are you going to?

38:05.137 --> 38:06.586
I see your face!

38:06.655 --> 38:07.689
- OK, go.
- OK.

38:07.758 --> 38:10.172
Thanks. Thanks.

38:10.241 --> 38:11.344
I find you!

38:46.137 --> 38:49.827
Hey, Lana, I got
to show you something.

38:54.103 --> 38:56.827
Yeah.
Jesus fucking Christ, Denny.

38:56.896 --> 38:59.000
Yeah, I took them
from Aaron's cabin last night.

38:59.068 --> 39:00.172
Why?

39:03.103 --> 39:06.448
I was just
so fucking angry at him.

39:06.517 --> 39:07.689
I was stupid.

39:07.758 --> 39:10.103
I shouldn't have.

39:10.172 --> 39:13.448
Wait,
were you gonna leave?

39:13.517 --> 39:16.172
And then this morning,
you said you needed passports,

39:16.241 --> 39:19.724
and I thought maybe I could
trade one of those for them,

39:19.793 --> 39:21.241
help you out.

39:26.172 --> 39:28.793
Aaron is gonna
go fucking nuts.

39:31.413 --> 39:35.379
I mean,
you just needed to go home.

39:35.448 --> 39:38.896
I don't know. I don't know
what he's gonna do.

39:43.241 --> 39:46.896
Well...

39:46.965 --> 39:49.137
maybe he doesn't need
to find out.

39:58.482 --> 40:00.344
Sounds good, yeah?

40:00.413 --> 40:02.206
Sweet, man.

40:02.275 --> 40:04.034
Shell!

40:04.103 --> 40:07.551
Shell, turn it off!

40:10.862 --> 40:12.068
Nice work.

40:14.965 --> 40:16.379
Denny's back.

40:52.620 --> 40:53.931
Where are they, Den?

40:54.000 --> 40:56.965
What the fuck are you up to?

40:59.068 --> 41:00.517
Hey, no!

41:00.586 --> 41:02.137
Hey! Hey, stop!

41:02.206 --> 41:04.758
- You ran out on me again!
- No!

41:04.827 --> 41:06.206
You don't fucking run out
on your brother!

41:06.275 --> 41:08.551
You know, after last night,
I thought about it!

41:08.620 --> 41:10.275
I really fucking did it!

41:10.344 --> 41:12.379
I fucking should have,
but I didn't.

41:12.448 --> 41:13.689
I stayed to help.

41:13.758 --> 41:15.068
Help, huh?
Help what? Help yourself?

41:15.137 --> 41:16.413
- To help you, you dick!
- You fuck!

41:16.482 --> 41:17.862
You, you fuck.

41:17.931 --> 41:19.965
To help Lana,
to help everyone.

41:20.034 --> 41:21.551
The diamonds were hot,
you fucking idiot.

41:21.620 --> 41:23.517
And you would have sat on them
until it was too late.

41:23.586 --> 41:25.172
Look, I thought
if I could sell them fast,

41:25.241 --> 41:27.862
get a really good price,
then we'd all be happy.

41:27.931 --> 41:29.137
Where are they now?
The gems?

41:29.206 --> 41:30.275
The police were just here
looking for them.

41:30.344 --> 41:32.137
They're gone.

41:32.206 --> 41:34.172
What?

41:34.241 --> 41:38.000
Denny's friend was fucking
murdered by a gang, I think.

41:38.068 --> 41:40.137
- Wait, wait.
- Ah.

41:40.206 --> 41:42.241
You're saying
someone's just been killed?

41:42.310 --> 41:45.310
Yeah.
They tried to kill us too.

41:47.034 --> 41:49.896
I lost Denny's bag
in the chase. I'm sorry.

41:51.827 --> 41:53.931
So it's all gone, hmm?

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
Everything we got is gone,
right?

41:59.206 --> 42:00.344
Shit.

42:01.620 --> 42:03.000
Shit.

42:03.068 --> 42:05.896
This is bullshit, Den.
Where are they?

42:08.758 --> 42:11.034
Check for yourself.

42:39.862 --> 42:41.172
Fuck!

42:48.655 --> 42:49.896
If Denny hadn't taken them,

42:49.965 --> 42:50.896
the police
would have found them,

42:50.965 --> 42:53.172
and we would all be fucked.

43:05.413 --> 43:08.413
We're shipping out right now.

43:11.034 --> 43:13.551
Heinrich, gets the bowline.

43:13.620 --> 43:15.448
- Where's Kitty?
- She went looking for you.

43:15.517 --> 43:17.034
Her and Joseph--
Get the fucking bowline!

43:17.103 --> 43:17.965
We're not leaving
without her.

43:18.034 --> 43:19.344
You can't do that.

43:21.620 --> 43:25.931
I told them
not to go after you, OK?

43:26.000 --> 43:27.241
So that's on them.

43:29.827 --> 43:31.137
Let's go.

43:35.931 --> 43:37.310
Aaron.

43:41.931 --> 43:43.448
Aaron, hey could be back
any minute.

43:43.517 --> 43:45.482
Those gangster mates
of yours, yeah?

43:45.551 --> 43:48.103
They see your face?
See where you went? Which boat?

43:49.724 --> 43:51.206
You know, in this part
of the world, darling,

43:51.275 --> 43:53.517
you don't mess
with people like that.

43:53.586 --> 43:54.965
Hey!

43:58.758 --> 43:59.862
Get off.

43:59.931 --> 44:01.862
- Get off!
- Aaron!

44:01.931 --> 44:04.000
Get your hands off her.

44:14.965 --> 44:16.827
I don't want to fight again.

44:16.896 --> 44:18.586
Then don't.

44:22.344 --> 44:23.620
Release!

44:23.689 --> 44:25.448
Yeah, it is.

44:48.000 --> 44:49.586
Don't make eye contact.

45:16.931 --> 45:19.620
- Is that The Blue?
- Shit.

45:19.689 --> 45:22.310
Shit. Shit.

45:23.793 --> 45:26.724
Hey!

45:26.793 --> 45:28.034
Guys!

45:30.517 --> 45:32.551
Stop!

45:32.620 --> 45:35.241
Guys! What the fuck?

45:35.310 --> 45:37.034
Wait, they're there!

45:37.103 --> 45:39.586
Aaron, stop the boat!

45:41.000 --> 45:42.896
Fucking stop!

45:42.965 --> 45:44.310
Stop! Aaron!

45:44.379 --> 45:46.517
- Aaron, stop!
- Wait for us!

45:48.724 --> 45:51.517
Guys!

45:51.586 --> 45:52.724
Please!

45:54.344 --> 45:57.034
Come on, man.
Fucking stop the boat!

45:57.103 --> 45:58.517
Stop!

45:58.586 --> 46:00.448
Aaron!

46:00.517 --> 46:02.000
Hey!

46:02.068 --> 46:03.793
Shell!
Kitty, come on!

46:03.862 --> 46:05.413
Come on!
Come on! Come on!

46:07.172 --> 46:09.448
Kitty!

46:09.517 --> 46:11.827
Kitty!

46:11.896 --> 46:13.620
- Stop!
- Kitty!

46:13.689 --> 46:15.793
Stop the engine!

46:15.862 --> 46:17.275
Release the fucking tender!

46:20.000 --> 46:22.068
- Jump!
- Kitty, jump!

46:22.137 --> 46:23.413
Jump!

46:23.482 --> 46:24.862
Come on, jump! Jump!

46:24.931 --> 46:26.103
Jump!

46:31.965 --> 46:34.241
Keep going!
Keep going!

46:37.034 --> 46:39.413
Aaron, slow down.

46:41.413 --> 46:44.310
Aaron. Come on, man.

46:46.448 --> 46:48.137
You're better than this.

46:48.206 --> 46:50.758
Slow down.

46:50.827 --> 46:54.068
Yeah, OK.

46:54.137 --> 46:55.758
Swim towards the tender!

47:02.206 --> 47:04.448
Come on!
Come on, Kitty!

47:04.517 --> 47:05.862
- Swim towards the tender!
- You can do it!

47:08.379 --> 47:09.724
Hurry, Kitty!

47:13.241 --> 47:14.655
Keep swimming!

47:40.103 --> 47:41.241
You're good.

47:57.517 --> 47:58.724
Fuck!

49:05.275 --> 49:07.689
I saw what you did
with the tender.

49:07.758 --> 49:09.241
Thank you.

49:37.137 --> 49:38.965
Hein, you go take the wheel.

49:40.793 --> 49:44.137
All right, well,
maybe we should clear the air.

49:44.206 --> 49:47.000
Yeah, I think we should.

49:48.827 --> 49:50.793
As captain,

49:50.862 --> 49:54.241
I will always put
the safety of this boat first.

49:56.241 --> 49:57.793
I may not always
get it right,

49:57.862 --> 49:59.310
but I will try.

49:59.379 --> 50:01.172
So I've made a decision.

50:01.241 --> 50:03.068
We're getting out
of the Philippines.

50:03.137 --> 50:05.827
I'm setting a course for Palau,
and then down to the Solomons,

50:05.896 --> 50:08.241
and then eventually back home
to Australia.

50:08.310 --> 50:11.172
But don't we get a vote
on this?

50:11.241 --> 50:13.862
No. The police
almost dragged us in.

50:13.931 --> 50:15.862
We could have all ended up
in a Filipino jail.

50:15.931 --> 50:19.827
I think we'd be lucky
if the police locked us up,

50:19.896 --> 50:23.448
because the alternative
is much worse.

50:23.517 --> 50:25.310
What alternative?

50:25.379 --> 50:28.413
Well, what we took
wasn't stolen.

50:28.482 --> 50:30.896
It wasn't fucking drug money.

50:30.965 --> 50:34.482
It was a ransom paid
by a powerful Filipino family

50:34.551 --> 50:37.448
to get back their kidnapped son
from a BLF.

50:37.517 --> 50:40.000
What's the BLF?

50:41.344 --> 50:42.620
Fucking terrorists.

50:42.689 --> 50:45.310
Yeah, terrorists,
criminals, separatists.

50:45.379 --> 50:47.241
You call them
what you fucking like.

50:48.862 --> 50:52.172
We just took the money
before they picked it up.

50:52.241 --> 50:55.344
So they did
what people like that do:

50:55.413 --> 50:57.448
killed the boy.

51:00.103 --> 51:01.379
14 years old.

51:01.448 --> 51:03.275
Fuck.

51:03.344 --> 51:06.344
A boy died because of us.

51:06.413 --> 51:08.000
A fucking human being.

51:10.137 --> 51:13.103
Those men that were
chasing Lana and Denny,

51:13.172 --> 51:15.344
you're saying that they were--
Yeah, BLF. BLF.

51:15.413 --> 51:16.965
They were BLF.
What do you think?

51:19.137 --> 51:21.724
And you led them
straight to our boat, Denny?

51:28.482 --> 51:29.758
It's late.

51:29.827 --> 51:34.103
Do you need a lift home
or sort of ride for you?

51:34.172 --> 51:36.103
Those bullet holes.

51:36.172 --> 51:38.896
When I left The Blue, I went to
a bar that we used to drink at.

51:38.965 --> 51:40.482
And the owner said
that the crew had

51:40.551 --> 51:42.896
had some trouble
down in Mindanao,

51:42.965 --> 51:44.620
in a town called Balakot.

51:44.689 --> 51:46.103
What kind of trouble?

51:46.172 --> 51:48.448
I think it was
with a local gang or something.

51:48.517 --> 51:49.586
I don't know.

51:49.655 --> 51:51.000
Why didn't you
mention this before?

51:51.068 --> 51:53.206
I didn't think of it.

51:53.275 --> 51:54.379
I think at the time,

51:54.448 --> 51:56.379
I thought
it was maybe just a joke

51:56.448 --> 51:57.724
or stupid tourist gossip.

51:57.793 --> 52:00.344
But those bullet holes--
All right.

52:00.413 --> 52:04.172
So can you remember any
specifics on who this gang was?

52:04.241 --> 52:06.827
No, I don't,

52:06.896 --> 52:09.620
but I think
that you need to start looking

52:09.689 --> 52:11.034
for boats heading back
to the Philippines.

52:11.103 --> 52:12.344
People get taken hostage.

52:12.413 --> 52:13.551
It happens down there
all the time, and--

52:13.620 --> 52:15.103
All right, calm down.

52:15.172 --> 52:17.965
Look, it's probably like you
said, probably just gossip.

52:18.034 --> 52:19.379
But I tell you what.

52:19.448 --> 52:21.586
There's a gentleman in there
from the PPS, right?

52:21.655 --> 52:23.310
He is based in Balakot,
so he's got--

52:23.379 --> 52:24.413
- PPS?
- Yeah.

52:24.482 --> 52:25.448
Philippine Police Service.

52:25.517 --> 52:27.620
Flew in this evening.

52:27.689 --> 52:29.482
So does he know something?

52:29.551 --> 52:31.275
Well, I'm just about
to sit down with him

52:31.344 --> 52:32.655
and find out what he knows.

52:32.724 --> 52:34.965
But either way,
I'll run your rumor past him,

52:35.034 --> 52:37.620
see what he says, OK?

52:37.689 --> 52:42.413
And thanks again, Emma.

52:52.551 --> 52:54.000
Chief Inspector Craven.

53:03.241 --> 53:04.827
Ready with the tickets?

53:04.896 --> 53:06.896
- Got everything now?
- Yeah, thank you.

53:06.965 --> 53:08.827
Keep safe.
Best of luck.

53:08.896 --> 53:11.137
Passengers
with heavy baggage,

53:11.206 --> 53:15.965
contact the driver for stowing
prior to the departure.

53:16.034 --> 53:19.241
Final call for train 18
with one carry.
