00:16.020 --> 00:18.693
Tomorrow marks
the one year anniversary

00:18.740 --> 00:21.413
since Velez Air Flight 180
exploded and crashed

00:21.500 --> 00:23.650
shortly after takeoff
from JFK Airport.

00:23.740 --> 00:25.731
It's a disaster
that's affected many.

00:25.820 --> 00:28.459
None more so than
Mt Abraham High School,

00:28.540 --> 00:32.453
which lost 40 students and four
faculty members in the crash.

00:32.540 --> 00:34.770
But it was the events
after the crash

00:34.860 --> 00:37.897
that has turned this tragic story
into something even stranger.

00:37.980 --> 00:41.609
The survivors who managed
to get off the plane before it crashed

00:41.700 --> 00:43.656
died soon thereafter
in a series

00:43.740 --> 00:46.049
of mysterious
and bizarre accidents.

00:46.140 --> 00:49.371
Now, to some, these deaths
are just tragic coincidences,

00:49.460 --> 00:51.337
but to others,
they're an indication

00:51.420 --> 00:53.888
that there are more
sinister events taking place.

00:53.980 --> 00:55.811
That's the contention
of tonight's guest.

00:55.900 --> 00:57.697
Thank you for joining us
this evening.

00:57.780 --> 00:59.293
Thank you for having me.

00:59.380 --> 01:01.336
And I appreciate you using
the word sinister.

01:01.420 --> 01:03.888
Most people say supernatural
because they think I'm talking

01:03.980 --> 01:07.131
about ghosts and witches
and stuff like that.

01:07.220 --> 01:09.688
Here's your chance
to set the record straight.

01:09.780 --> 01:12.089
Great. Okay.

01:12.180 --> 01:15.616
I believe that there's
a sort of force,

01:15.700 --> 01:19.454
an unseen malevolent
presence...

01:19.540 --> 01:21.371
that's all around us
every day.

01:21.460 --> 01:24.770
And it determines
when we live and die.

01:26.060 --> 01:29.052
And some people call
this force the devil,

01:29.140 --> 01:31.608
but I think that
whole religious thing is...

01:31.700 --> 01:34.817
so I prefer to call it
Death itself.

01:34.900 --> 01:37.368
So I'm surrounded by Death?

01:37.460 --> 01:39.451
Absolutely. Absolutely.

01:39.540 --> 01:42.816
Every day, everywhere,
all the time.

01:42.900 --> 01:45.368
And that's what I want people
to understand...

01:45.460 --> 01:47.291
that Death
has this grand design

01:47.380 --> 01:49.371
that we all fit into.

01:49.460 --> 01:52.099
So when Alex Browning
got off that plane

01:52.180 --> 01:54.171
and took the other
survivors with him,

01:54.260 --> 01:56.649
he basically screwed up
Death's plan.

01:56.740 --> 01:59.379
And that's what I'm trying
to warn people about.

01:59.460 --> 02:02.418
And the fact that all
of the survivors have died

02:02.500 --> 02:04.570
is your evidence of this?

02:06.460 --> 02:08.973
Well, it's not so much
that the survivors died,

02:09.060 --> 02:11.096
but it's the way
that they died.

02:12.380 --> 02:14.416
I mean, there were
so many weird,

02:14.500 --> 02:17.173
seemingly random things
about the way they died.

02:17.260 --> 02:20.809
It just didn't
make sense.

02:20.900 --> 02:23.698
And that's the proof
there's something out there...

02:23.780 --> 02:27.295
Wait, that's not proof.
That is your interpretation

02:27.380 --> 02:30.292
of events that can't be proven
in order to support your ideas.

02:30.380 --> 02:32.336
Kimberly.

02:32.420 --> 02:34.570
You should be more
open-minded...

02:34.660 --> 02:37.333
What happened after that
was just coincidence.

02:37.420 --> 02:39.331
May I finish?

02:39.420 --> 02:42.253
Mere coincidence would have
one or two of these kids die.

02:42.340 --> 02:44.490
But not all of them
including their teachers.

02:44.580 --> 02:46.889
Yes, but people die
all the time,

02:46.980 --> 02:49.289
so why should this be
any different?

02:49.380 --> 02:51.655
It forced people
to question

02:51.740 --> 02:54.174
these so-called
everyday coincidences.

02:54.260 --> 02:56.091
What if they
were something more?

02:56.180 --> 02:58.171
What if you could do
something about it?

02:58.260 --> 03:00.899
Please, are you listening
to yourself? This is crazy.

03:00.980 --> 03:04.131
You're saying we should be on guard
every morning when we leave the house?

03:04.220 --> 03:06.814
That's exactly what
I'm saying.

03:06.900 --> 03:09.050
Exactly it.

03:09.140 --> 03:10.858
And in order
to survive...

03:10.940 --> 03:13.249
the only way to survive

03:13.340 --> 03:15.490
is to look beneath
the visible world.

03:15.580 --> 03:19.334
Because in the end no one
can escape death.

03:19.420 --> 03:21.888
And today may be
your day to die.

03:33.900 --> 03:35.618
Okay, I'll call you.

03:35.700 --> 03:37.691
Kimberly, are you sure
you've got everything?

03:37.780 --> 03:39.771
Credit card,
cell phone, Triple-A card?

03:39.860 --> 03:42.169
Dad, it's Daytona,
not Somalia.

03:42.260 --> 03:45.855
Alright. Fix-a-flat, road flares,
sunblock, mace?

03:45.940 --> 03:48.249
Condoms,
whips, chains.

03:49.300 --> 03:50.813
Just kidding,
Mr. Corman.

03:50.900 --> 03:52.652
Don't worry,
I'll keep an eye on her.

03:52.740 --> 03:55.254
That makes me feel
a lot better, thanks.

03:56.700 --> 03:58.577
- Okay.
- Alrighty.

03:58.660 --> 04:01.697
Can we go get the guys?
I'm getting horny.

04:03.820 --> 04:05.617
Go on.

04:05.700 --> 04:07.770
Okay, I'll call you.

04:10.140 --> 04:12.495
Whips and chains.
That's nice.

04:12.580 --> 04:14.730
Whatever,
your dad's cool.

04:17.980 --> 04:19.652
Buckle up!

04:46.420 --> 04:48.490
Watch it!

04:48.580 --> 04:51.652
- Oh, easy, Kimmy. First year of driving?
- Sorry.

04:56.580 --> 04:58.650
- Oh my God.
- Fucking freak.

05:00.900 --> 05:02.777
Yo, Dano,
shouldn't we help your mum?

05:02.860 --> 05:04.657
Good one, man.
You're hilarious.

05:06.420 --> 05:08.138
You're not getting any of my weed.
Nothing.

05:08.220 --> 05:09.335
Whatever.

05:09.420 --> 05:11.650
What are we going to do
in Daytona?

05:11.740 --> 05:13.856
We're going to see lots
of honeys there.

05:13.940 --> 05:16.693
We're gonna get drunk, we're gonna smoke
this big 'El Gagerero,'

05:16.780 --> 05:18.498
We're gonna have this
awesome party...

05:18.580 --> 05:21.048
Pileup! Pileup!

05:31.340 --> 05:33.695
A candlelight vigil to mark
the one year anniversary

05:33.780 --> 05:36.738
of the crash of Flight 180
will be held at 8:00 P.M. Tonight

05:36.820 --> 05:38.811
at the Mt Abraham
high school auditorium.

05:38.900 --> 05:42.176
# Highway to hell... #

05:55.300 --> 05:57.291
Oh my God.

06:00.620 --> 06:03.088
- Hello?
- Hey, Kimberly, it's Dad.

06:03.180 --> 06:06.297
- Hey, what's up?
- Your car's leaking transmission fluid.

06:06.380 --> 06:08.769
- So I want you to get it checked right away.
- Okay, yeah.

06:08.860 --> 06:10.339
I'll do that.

06:10.420 --> 06:12.297
I mean it. Take care of it.

06:13.900 --> 06:15.777
- Is that someone coughing?
- Yeah, okay.

06:15.860 --> 06:17.976
I'll take care of it.
I'll talk to you later.

06:18.060 --> 06:19.778
- I love you.
- Bye, honey.

06:20.900 --> 06:23.368
- What did you do?
- Look at those titties!

06:24.580 --> 06:26.810
- Shut up.
- You missed that?!

06:28.580 --> 06:30.969
That's too bad.
That's too bad.

06:32.180 --> 06:34.011
Oh, shit!

06:34.100 --> 06:36.853
Fuck man, there's a cop behind us!
Pull in the right lane now!

06:36.940 --> 06:38.339
Shit.

06:46.260 --> 06:48.137
Seriously, put it out.

06:48.220 --> 06:50.211
- Put that thing out.
- Alright.

06:50.300 --> 06:51.733
Wait, wait, wait!

06:51.820 --> 06:53.458
- Get rid of it.
- Shit.

06:57.100 --> 06:58.294
Hey, it's Kat.

06:58.380 --> 07:00.291
Listen...
what the hell?!

07:00.380 --> 07:02.098
Just wait. Not you.

07:16.980 --> 07:20.131
I think we better pull over
and check the car, because...

07:20.220 --> 07:22.529
Kimberly, the car
is going to be fine.

07:22.620 --> 07:25.737
Your dad's going to be fine,
you're going to be fine.

07:25.820 --> 07:27.538
Okay?

07:54.860 --> 07:56.737
Look at that guy.

07:58.140 --> 08:00.779
He's drinking a beer.

08:02.860 --> 08:05.090
Oh, yeah,
that's real responsible.

08:37.419 --> 08:40.173
You ever hear
of the ozone layer, arsehole?!

09:06.860 --> 09:09.613
# When it comes to this drug shit
I was made to play #

09:09.700 --> 09:13.818
# Don't come around if
you ain't got no cocaine to bring... #

09:20.700 --> 09:23.533
What? I'm wearing
my seatbelt.

09:23.620 --> 09:26.180
You're gonna bust me,
bitch?!

09:41.140 --> 09:42.255
Aaah!

09:42.340 --> 09:43.773
Son of a...

09:44.780 --> 09:46.179
bitch.

09:58.740 --> 10:00.219
Fuck!

10:32.700 --> 10:34.497
- Oh my God!
- Watch out!

10:34.580 --> 10:36.377
- Stop!
- Oh my God!

10:36.460 --> 10:38.212
Watch out!
Aaah!

11:19.820 --> 11:22.209
Shaina?

11:26.220 --> 11:28.780
I can't get out of here!

11:30.260 --> 11:31.978
Help me!

11:42.660 --> 11:45.254
Oh, easy, Kimmy.
First year of driving?

11:58.860 --> 12:00.851
Yo, Dano,
shouldn't we help your mum?

12:00.940 --> 12:03.010
Good one, man.
You're hilarious.

12:03.100 --> 12:05.170
Pileup! Pileup!

12:07.020 --> 12:08.851
- Oh my God.
- What?

12:08.940 --> 12:10.771
There's going to be
a huge accident.

12:10.860 --> 12:12.578
We're all gonna die!
I just saw it.

12:12.660 --> 12:14.093
That's it.
My turn to drive.

12:14.180 --> 12:16.569
- No, I'm serious.
- Kim, what's wrong?

12:18.900 --> 12:21.334
- What are you doing?
- Oh my God.

12:21.420 --> 12:24.218
...of Flight 180 will be held
at 8:00 P.M. Tonight

12:24.300 --> 12:26.495
at the Mt Abraham
high school auditorium.

12:26.580 --> 12:29.936
'Highway to hell.'
'Highway to hell... '

12:30.020 --> 12:31.499
'Highway to hell'?

12:31.580 --> 12:33.855
# I'm on a highway to hell... #

12:33.940 --> 12:35.498
Okay, Kimberly,
you're scaring me.

12:37.780 --> 12:39.850
- Green means go, Kimmy.
- Yeah.

12:46.340 --> 12:48.808
Are you out of your friggin' mind?
What the hell are you doing?

12:48.900 --> 12:50.219
What the fuck, Kimberly?

12:52.180 --> 12:54.250
What's this?

13:00.100 --> 13:01.897
Kimberly, you just got
to breathe.

13:01.980 --> 13:04.619
Oh, shit, shit.
Five-O's coming. Let's fucking roll.

13:04.700 --> 13:06.418
- What?
- Oh my God.

13:06.500 --> 13:08.252
Do you know how much
fucking weed I have on me? Huh?

13:08.340 --> 13:10.808
Okay, Dano, just shut up!
Just stay cool.

13:18.180 --> 13:20.774
Oh, fuck. I'm going to jail.
I'm fucking going to jail.

13:33.900 --> 13:35.458
What's going on here?

13:35.540 --> 13:37.735
I think there's going
to be a huge pileup.

13:37.820 --> 13:39.776
I saw it.

13:39.860 --> 13:41.691
There were bodies
everywhere.

13:41.780 --> 13:43.611
There were logs...
I saw it.

13:43.700 --> 13:45.292
It just happened.

13:45.380 --> 13:48.452
Alright, miss, I'd like you to please
step out of the vehicle.

13:58.860 --> 14:00.896
Just pull over!

14:00.980 --> 14:03.335
I know,
Mummy's hungry, too.

14:07.180 --> 14:08.738
Come on.

14:08.820 --> 14:11.095
Come on!

14:11.180 --> 14:13.057
Oh, fuck this.

14:13.140 --> 14:16.291
I'm going to get this
and we're going to go.

14:27.100 --> 14:29.375
Fuck.

14:29.460 --> 14:31.610
What the hell
is going on up there?

14:31.700 --> 14:33.099
Excuse me!

14:33.180 --> 14:35.648
Is there any way
that we could drive around?

14:35.740 --> 14:38.538
- I have a delivery...
- You need to get back into your vehicles.

14:38.620 --> 14:40.372
- Just move it...
- Now!

14:45.620 --> 14:47.099
That's it!

14:48.380 --> 14:50.496
That's the truck
that's going to kill everybody.

14:50.580 --> 14:52.218
You need to stop
that truck!

14:52.300 --> 14:54.052
I told you again,
you have to calm down!

14:54.140 --> 14:56.654
Why won't you listen to me?!

14:58.900 --> 15:01.289
- Fuck!
- Oh my God.

15:07.740 --> 15:10.573
This is unit 13 requesting
medical assistance

15:10.660 --> 15:13.128
and backup for a major
traffic accident...

15:13.220 --> 15:15.336
Kimberly, what's going on?

15:38.460 --> 15:40.416
No!

15:40.500 --> 15:42.377
No!

15:59.340 --> 16:01.854
Listen, sir,
this girl is really freaked out.

16:01.940 --> 16:03.089
In fact, all of them are...

16:03.180 --> 16:05.216
- scared as you can imagine.
- Scared?!

16:05.300 --> 16:08.417
These people are the luckiest
sons of bitches on the planet.

16:08.500 --> 16:09.853
Get this guy,
Evan Lewis...

16:09.940 --> 16:11.612
yesterday the kid
wins the lotto.

16:11.700 --> 16:13.531
Today, some loony bitch
blocks traffic

16:13.620 --> 16:15.451
and he avoids the worst
pileup in years.

16:15.540 --> 16:17.212
I should be
so damn 'unlucky.'

16:17.300 --> 16:18.653
Go babysit the rest of them.

16:18.740 --> 16:20.378
I'll be done with Lewis
in a minute.

16:20.460 --> 16:23.418
Hey, excuse me...

16:23.500 --> 16:25.172
We're trying to do
the best we can.

16:25.260 --> 16:27.728
We're going to get you
out of here as soon as possible.

16:27.820 --> 16:30.334
I just think it's a bunch
of bullshit.

16:35.820 --> 16:37.811
Listen, I know
you've gone over all this

16:37.900 --> 16:39.618
with Detective Suby...

16:41.220 --> 16:43.939
but would you mind
telling me what happened?

16:45.700 --> 16:47.452
It was like I was there.

16:50.060 --> 16:53.370
I knew something bad was going
to happen even before it did.

16:55.660 --> 16:58.697
- I just felt wrong, just like...
- Just like what?

17:02.980 --> 17:05.618
Look, I know
this sounds crazy but...

17:05.700 --> 17:07.974
you guys all heard
about Flight 180, right?

17:08.060 --> 17:10.016
The kid who got off
the plane?

17:10.099 --> 17:12.136
Well, it happened
a year ago, today.

17:14.980 --> 17:17.130
My premonition
was just like his.

17:20.740 --> 17:23.811
- What are you talking about?
- Come on.

17:23.900 --> 17:25.492
You must have read
about the kid

17:25.579 --> 17:27.411
who had a dream
about a plane blowing up,

17:27.500 --> 17:29.331
so he got all his buddies
off the plane

17:29.420 --> 17:31.980
and then the thing blew up
just like in his dream?

17:32.060 --> 17:34.449
- Yeah.
- But did you hear what happened after?

17:35.820 --> 17:37.651
So a month goes by, right?

17:37.740 --> 17:39.731
Everything seems cool.

17:41.020 --> 17:43.534
But then all the survivors
start to die one by one.

17:43.620 --> 17:46.180
'Cause when your number's up,
your number's up, right?

17:48.220 --> 17:52.850
You know, some people even say that
Death itself was stalking them,

17:52.940 --> 17:55.090
hunting each one down

17:55.180 --> 17:58.570
until they were all...
dead.

18:02.340 --> 18:03.978
Please.

18:05.500 --> 18:07.616
There was one survivor.

18:09.540 --> 18:11.258
Clear Rivers is
in a padded room

18:11.340 --> 18:13.934
at the Stonybrook Institution.

18:14.020 --> 18:15.578
Well, that's encouraging.

18:18.140 --> 18:20.813
Okay, you want me
to believe that this is true,

18:20.900 --> 18:23.539
that this is happening
all over again?

18:23.620 --> 18:25.656
I don't know why
we're even here.

18:27.180 --> 18:28.659
What do you want from me?

18:28.740 --> 18:31.379
But if I was never meant
to pull over,

18:31.460 --> 18:33.815
we all should have died
in that pileup.

18:33.900 --> 18:35.811
Which means Death
could be coming for us.

18:35.900 --> 18:37.618
Yeah, like, what if

18:37.700 --> 18:41.136
we're all getting that 'Different Strokes'
curse or something?

18:41.220 --> 18:43.859
I think you're all
are certifiable.

18:43.940 --> 18:45.931
I can't believe I've been listening
to this crap.

18:46.020 --> 18:48.659
Let's go.
Let's go, Tim.

18:48.740 --> 18:51.413
Mrs. Carpenter, please.

18:56.060 --> 18:57.812
Kimberly!

18:59.220 --> 19:00.938
Oh baby!

19:02.140 --> 19:04.495
- Are you okay?
- I'm so sorry.

19:04.580 --> 19:06.059
Shh, shh.

19:06.140 --> 19:08.415
You can all go now.
Thank you for your patience.

19:28.060 --> 19:29.937
Could I ask you something?

19:30.020 --> 19:32.329
Anything.

19:32.420 --> 19:35.059
Did Mum ever have any...

19:35.140 --> 19:38.576
I don't know,
weird feelings about anything?

19:39.580 --> 19:41.298
What do you mean?

19:43.740 --> 19:47.255
Like visions or premonitions.

19:48.540 --> 19:50.576
Sweetie, are you sure
you're okay?

19:50.660 --> 19:53.299
Dad, I know
this sounds crazy,

19:53.380 --> 19:55.530
but I'm really scared
for the others.

19:55.620 --> 19:59.249
I don't know,
I have this really bad feeling.

20:00.540 --> 20:01.973
What?

20:03.540 --> 20:05.496
It's not over yet.

20:27.500 --> 20:29.536
Jesus Christ!

20:29.620 --> 20:31.497
Shit!

21:58.180 --> 22:00.978
Hey, Evan, it's Tawny.

22:01.060 --> 22:02.891
Sorry I haven't called.

22:02.980 --> 22:05.574
Hey, listen, I heard
about your lottery win.

22:05.660 --> 22:08.174
Let's hook up.
Call me.

22:08.260 --> 22:10.535
Yeah.

22:10.620 --> 22:12.292
Hi, Evan, it's Nikki.

22:12.380 --> 22:14.416
We met at Tucker's party
last year?

22:14.500 --> 22:16.968
I know it's been awhile,
but I've been thinking about you.

22:17.060 --> 22:19.654
I just wanted to say
congratulations.

22:19.740 --> 22:21.617
So give me a call.

22:21.700 --> 22:23.850
555-0123. Bye.

22:25.340 --> 22:27.217
You little bastard.

22:27.300 --> 22:28.892
Shit.

22:33.380 --> 22:36.338
Come on.
Come on.

22:43.380 --> 22:45.336
Fuck. Fuck.

22:55.220 --> 22:56.938
Come on!

22:57.020 --> 22:58.612
Come on.

23:04.740 --> 23:06.139
Fuck!

23:06.220 --> 23:07.539
Jesus!

23:15.220 --> 23:16.289
Oh!

23:22.940 --> 23:24.771
Hey, this is Evan.
Leave a message.

23:24.860 --> 23:27.249
If you're looking for Rick,
I don't know where he is,

23:27.340 --> 23:29.979
and I don't know
when he's coming back. Thanks.

23:30.060 --> 23:33.848
Evan, call me when you
get in, you lucky fuck!

24:00.220 --> 24:03.257
Come on! Come on!
Come on!

24:03.340 --> 24:05.012
Aah!

24:34.180 --> 24:35.659
Jesus!

24:40.060 --> 24:41.652
Come on.

24:49.580 --> 24:50.933
Aah!

24:53.580 --> 24:55.377
Shit, I'm lucky.

24:57.700 --> 24:59.497
Aah!

25:02.420 --> 25:04.331
Jesus Christ!

26:26.780 --> 26:28.657
No, Mother,

26:28.740 --> 26:31.300
just turn on any station.

26:31.380 --> 26:34.417
Well, I don't know how you missed it,
it's been on all day.

26:34.500 --> 26:36.968
Yes, Mother,
Channel 4 is fine.

26:37.060 --> 26:40.018
Okay... here it is!
I got to go, okay?

26:40.100 --> 26:41.931
I got to go!

26:42.940 --> 26:44.658
To recap our top story,

26:44.740 --> 26:48.176
Route 23 was backed up
for almost nine hours today.

26:48.260 --> 26:51.218
A record-breaking pileup
killed an estimated 18 people.

26:51.300 --> 26:54.212
Emergency crews spent hours
sifting through the wreckage

26:54.300 --> 26:57.258
hoping to recover any survivors
from this tragic collision.

26:57.340 --> 27:00.173
So far police are refusing
to release the names of the victims

27:00.260 --> 27:01.898
until the families
are notified.

27:01.980 --> 27:03.732
The camera
of a highway patrol car

27:03.820 --> 27:05.651
managed to catch
this shocking footage.

27:05.740 --> 27:07.696
- A semi comes...
- Oh my God.

27:07.780 --> 27:09.577
And smashes
into a red SUV.

27:09.660 --> 27:13.096
- The driver of the SUV...
- No, um...

27:13.180 --> 27:14.533
leave it.

27:14.620 --> 27:15.973
...may have
saved her life.

27:16.060 --> 27:17.812
He pulled her back
at the last second

27:17.900 --> 27:19.856
just as the semi ploughed
into the vehicle.

27:19.940 --> 27:21.612
The passengers inside
the SUV...

27:21.700 --> 27:24.373
Oh, oh, oh! You guys see that?!
Shit, I was there, baby!

27:24.460 --> 27:28.248
In other news, a freak accident took
the life of a lotto winner.

27:28.340 --> 27:30.092
- Friends say Evan Lewis...
- Hey, shh.

27:30.180 --> 27:33.729
Was on top of the world after
recently winning $250,000.

27:33.820 --> 27:36.380
But in tragic turn of events,
Lewis died today

27:36.460 --> 27:38.928
while trying to escape a fire
in his apartment.

27:39.020 --> 27:40.692
He managed to make it out
of the building,

27:40.780 --> 27:42.850
but somehow the ladder
on the fire escape

27:42.940 --> 27:44.771
slipped and impaled him.

27:44.860 --> 27:47.249
Investigators believe Lewis
died instantly.

27:54.180 --> 27:57.058
Come in.

27:58.820 --> 28:00.253
Hey, buddy.

28:01.700 --> 28:04.419
I want you to take this
so you can get some sleep.

28:06.180 --> 28:09.377
And then tomorrow it's off to the dentist,
which I know you love.

28:10.980 --> 28:12.732
Now, get some rest.

28:17.060 --> 28:19.574
- Mum.
- Yeah?

28:19.660 --> 28:21.616
You think those guys
were BSing us today?

28:21.700 --> 28:23.372
Yeah.

28:23.460 --> 28:25.769
Some people just need
some rewiring, that's all.

28:27.140 --> 28:28.573
Lights out.

30:22.140 --> 30:24.176
At the request
of the patient,

30:24.260 --> 30:26.171
you'll relinquish
any sharp objects

30:26.260 --> 30:28.490
such as: 'nail files,
pencils, pens,

30:28.580 --> 30:31.378
safety pins, bobby pins,
your necklace,

30:31.460 --> 30:33.928
matches, lighters,
belts, belt buckles,

30:34.020 --> 30:36.978
earrings, hair clips,
glasses, shoelaces,

30:37.060 --> 30:39.972
paper clips, watches, money clip,
pocket knives,

30:40.060 --> 30:42.574
food, drinks, keys,
cell phone... '

30:42.660 --> 30:44.730
You have a cell phone
on you?

30:44.820 --> 30:47.618
'... poisons, pills,
medications.'

30:47.700 --> 30:50.168
Great. And let me see
your nails.

30:50.260 --> 30:52.728
Good. Then I think
we're all done.

30:52.820 --> 30:54.651
Wait.

30:54.740 --> 30:56.571
Is she dangerous
or something?

30:56.660 --> 30:58.537
No, honey,
she expects you are.

31:01.060 --> 31:04.097
No, no, no.

31:04.180 --> 31:07.252
Get him off me.
Get him off me!

31:14.500 --> 31:16.968
How long are they gonna keep
her locked up like this?

31:17.060 --> 31:19.415
Depends on her, I guess.
She's voluntary.

31:46.340 --> 31:48.854
- Clear Rivers?
- Don't come any closer.

31:56.820 --> 32:00.176
They told me you had something to do
with the crash on Route 23.

32:00.260 --> 32:03.058
Look, I don't know how
to explain it,

32:03.140 --> 32:06.291
but I saw the pileup
before it happened.

32:07.740 --> 32:09.731
And I saved some people.

32:09.820 --> 32:12.050
And now you think Death
is after you.

32:13.780 --> 32:15.736
Nice work.

32:15.820 --> 32:18.937
Maybe if you're real lucky,
you'll wind up in here with me.

32:20.460 --> 32:22.052
Anything else?

32:22.140 --> 32:24.495
One of the people died
in a freak accident last night.

32:24.580 --> 32:26.571
What if the other people
are in danger, too?

32:26.660 --> 32:28.935
If you put them on the list,
they're already dead.

32:29.020 --> 32:31.215
List? What list?

32:31.300 --> 32:33.370
Death's list.

32:35.740 --> 32:37.890
The survivors of Flight 180

32:37.980 --> 32:40.130
died in the exact order

32:40.220 --> 32:42.893
they were originally meant
to die in the plane crash.

32:44.020 --> 32:45.931
That was Death's original design.

32:47.260 --> 32:48.818
The list.

32:48.900 --> 32:51.255
I was supposed to die
in that crash with my friends.

32:51.340 --> 32:52.932
So you're telling me
that I'm next?

32:53.020 --> 32:55.090
You said someone else died
last night.

32:55.180 --> 32:57.136
That means someone must
have intervened.

32:57.220 --> 33:01.293
Officer Burke pulled me away
from the crash that killed my friends.

33:01.380 --> 33:03.177
Congratulations.

33:03.260 --> 33:05.728
You'll be the last to go.

33:05.820 --> 33:08.288
But don't worry,
once the others are dead,

33:08.380 --> 33:09.938
it'll come back for you.

33:11.220 --> 33:13.176
It always does.

33:14.420 --> 33:16.092
This doesn't make sense.

33:16.180 --> 33:20.332
You said that you die in
the order you're originally meant to.

33:20.420 --> 33:24.015
But my friends died last
in my premonition, not first.

33:24.100 --> 33:25.977
Wait.

33:27.060 --> 33:29.290
Died last?

33:31.220 --> 33:33.017
Backwards.

33:33.100 --> 33:35.056
Are you sure?

33:36.900 --> 33:38.618
In my premonition

33:38.700 --> 33:40.531
that Nora woman
and her kid died.

33:40.620 --> 33:43.612
Then Evan,
then me and my friends.

33:46.500 --> 33:48.570
Why is this even
happening to me?

33:52.900 --> 33:55.130
That's what Alex used
to ask himself.

33:56.740 --> 33:58.935
So, what am I
supposed to do?

33:59.020 --> 34:00.897
Clear.

34:02.500 --> 34:04.218
Watch out for the signs.

34:04.300 --> 34:05.938
What?

34:08.260 --> 34:11.172
Have you ever seen anything
creepy or ominous?

34:11.260 --> 34:13.853
An in-your-face irony
kind of thing?

34:16.100 --> 34:18.455
The songs on the radio.

34:18.540 --> 34:21.373
Yeah, the guy in the beer truck,
everything on the road.

34:21.460 --> 34:23.610
Well, don't ignore it.

34:23.699 --> 34:27.170
Recognizing those signs usually means
the difference between life and death.

34:27.260 --> 34:29.614
You got to help me.

34:29.699 --> 34:31.257
I don't have
to do anything.

34:31.340 --> 34:32.978
But you beat it.

34:33.060 --> 34:34.732
Take a look around.

34:34.820 --> 34:36.697
What did I beat, Kimberly?

34:38.940 --> 34:42.056
If you were smart, you'd save yourself
and just forget about the others.

34:42.139 --> 34:44.608
How can you say that?
You have a responsibility.

34:44.699 --> 34:46.735
My friends are dead.

34:46.820 --> 34:48.697
That's how I can say that.

34:50.500 --> 34:53.697
This is what happened to Alex
when I was responsible for him.

34:54.780 --> 34:56.657
Get out.

34:56.739 --> 34:59.015
Before you hurt me or yourself.

35:02.780 --> 35:05.499
- Alright, you know what?
- What?

35:05.580 --> 35:06.899
I think you're a coward.

35:06.980 --> 35:08.538
You hide out in here
because you're

35:08.620 --> 35:11.692
too damn bitter and selfish
to help any other person.

35:11.780 --> 35:13.611
In my opinion,
you're already dead.

35:50.060 --> 35:52.016
I tried calling you
last night,

35:52.100 --> 35:54.011
but your father said
you were sleeping.

35:54.100 --> 35:55.738
- Evan Lewis is dead.
- Yeah.

35:55.820 --> 35:58.971
I've been getting calls all morning from
everyone who was on the on-ramp.

35:59.060 --> 36:01.096
We're meeting tonight
at my apartment.

36:01.180 --> 36:04.297
Wait, so...
you believe all this Death stuff?

36:05.460 --> 36:07.928
Well, at first,
no, I didn't.

36:08.020 --> 36:10.011
Until last year
when I was dispatched

36:10.100 --> 36:12.295
to clean up one
of the Flight 180 survivors.

36:12.380 --> 36:14.052
Clean up, I don't...

36:18.420 --> 36:20.809
- Did you see that?
- See what?

36:20.900 --> 36:23.289
- Pigeons.
- Pigeons?

36:23.380 --> 36:25.211
- It's a sign.
- A sign of what?

36:25.300 --> 36:26.972
If Clear's right
about the order,

36:27.060 --> 36:30.097
then Nora and Tim are going
to be attacked by pigeons.

36:30.180 --> 36:31.613
I'm not following you.

36:31.700 --> 36:33.292
They're next
on Death's list.

36:33.380 --> 36:35.735
If we don't find them,
they're going to die.

37:21.500 --> 37:23.411
The doctor's ready
for you, now.

37:23.500 --> 37:25.252
If he gives me the gas

37:25.340 --> 37:27.331
and I wake up
with my pants unbuttoned...

37:27.420 --> 37:30.810
- we ain't paying.
- Tim.

37:37.940 --> 37:41.728
There you are.
What happened to you yesterday, Tim?

37:41.820 --> 37:42.536
We missed you in here.

37:42.620 --> 37:45.054
We got hung up by that accident on
Route 23.

37:45.140 --> 37:47.700
Good Lord.
How lucky that you're okay.

37:49.340 --> 37:51.376
Your mum says you've been
having some pain lately.

37:51.460 --> 37:53.576
Not really.

38:17.780 --> 38:19.657
I'm disappointed, Tim.

38:19.740 --> 38:21.014
Does your mum know
you've been smoking?

38:21.100 --> 38:24.137
Uh-huh.
Ow.

38:24.220 --> 38:26.256
Yeah, that one's going
to have to be filled.

38:27.580 --> 38:29.332
Damn those pigeons.

38:29.420 --> 38:32.696
How many times am I going to have to
replace those goddamn windows?

38:35.060 --> 38:37.733
We can't do it, boss,
we can't do it!

38:37.820 --> 38:40.334
This will only sting for a moment.

38:40.420 --> 38:42.536
Open big.

38:42.620 --> 38:44.133
Little bit wider.

38:44.220 --> 38:46.051
Wider.

38:46.140 --> 38:48.495
Okay.

38:49.700 --> 38:51.656
Oh God.

38:51.740 --> 38:53.492
How do they
expect me to...

38:53.580 --> 38:56.048
Would you rather just have
the laughing gas?

38:56.140 --> 38:58.290
- Yeah.
- Okay.

38:58.380 --> 39:00.132
Jean, I'm going
to need you in here.

39:02.620 --> 39:04.736
You'll have to speak up,
there's too much noise.

39:06.740 --> 39:09.573
What?!
I can't hear you!

39:09.660 --> 39:11.651
Excuse me, what?!

39:12.980 --> 39:15.574
Yes, the sixth at 2:00 P.M.

39:15.660 --> 39:18.220
Jean! Let me
get this started.

39:20.260 --> 39:21.932
Tim, you'll be awake,
a little groggy,

39:22.020 --> 39:24.056
but you're not going
to be able to move much.

39:48.300 --> 39:50.530
Okay, great, thanks.
Alright, turn around.

39:50.620 --> 39:53.737
The cleaning lady said they're at
the Ellis Medical Complex off of 14th.

39:57.300 --> 40:00.178
God damn it anyway.

40:07.220 --> 40:09.256
- Okay, I got it.
- I can't find a box!

40:11.220 --> 40:12.938
Not again. Careful.

40:52.620 --> 40:54.212
There we go.

41:03.180 --> 41:05.091
Jean,
how's Tim doing in there?

41:09.900 --> 41:11.618
What did he say
about your tooth?

41:11.700 --> 41:13.895
- Did he say...
- I can't remember.

41:13.980 --> 41:15.572
- Nora!
- The pigeons!

41:15.660 --> 41:17.810
What? Pigeons?

41:19.620 --> 41:21.451
Hey, whoa, whoa!
Kid, kid!

41:23.460 --> 41:25.098
- No-oo!
- Tim!

41:25.180 --> 41:26.329
Look out!

41:28.020 --> 41:30.329
- Stay back, stay back!
- No! Please, no!

41:47.900 --> 41:50.095
Nora's not coming.
She won't leave her son.

41:50.180 --> 41:53.968
- No, but she's next...
- Right now I don't think she cares.

42:12.220 --> 42:14.370
This is really
happening again, isn't it?

42:16.620 --> 42:18.497
I hoped we'd get there

42:18.580 --> 42:20.411
and they'd be fine,

42:20.500 --> 42:22.650
and Clear Rivers
was just full of shit,

42:22.740 --> 42:26.369
and Evan Lewis' death
was just some freak accident.

42:28.300 --> 42:30.370
But we're all going to die,
aren't we?

42:34.540 --> 42:36.451
I'm so scared.

42:37.820 --> 42:40.254
I know you didn't ask
for any of this...

42:41.380 --> 42:43.848
but I don't think you have it
in you to quit either.

42:51.980 --> 42:53.698
A second one just died.

42:53.780 --> 42:55.498
A 15-year-old kid.

42:57.420 --> 42:59.490
I hope you're ready for this.

43:10.660 --> 43:12.093
It's this way.

43:14.340 --> 43:16.695
How is this guy going
to help us anyway?

43:16.780 --> 43:19.089
He seemed to know
a hell of a lot more

43:19.180 --> 43:21.057
about Death
than he ever told us.

43:25.060 --> 43:26.937
Shouldn't we knock first?

43:27.020 --> 43:29.215
He probably already knows
we're coming.

44:14.580 --> 44:16.491
Hello, Clear.

44:22.260 --> 44:23.932
I've been expecting you.

44:24.020 --> 44:25.897
Oh my God.

44:27.420 --> 44:30.014
- That's Evan Lewis.
- Come to pick my brain?

44:30.100 --> 44:33.137
Just a simple question and we'll leave you
alone with your new friend.

44:34.740 --> 44:36.617
Dead...

44:36.700 --> 44:39.373
yet still fresh.

44:40.740 --> 44:42.696
Look, we drove
a long way to get here,

44:42.780 --> 44:44.736
so if you happen to know
how to stop Death,

44:44.820 --> 44:46.492
it would be really great
if you told us.

44:47.540 --> 44:49.098
You can't cheat Death.

44:49.180 --> 44:51.819
- There are no escapes.
- Bullshit.

44:51.900 --> 44:54.653
You told me Death
has a distinct design.

44:54.740 --> 44:57.891
But Alex and I cheated Death,
not once but dozens of times.

44:57.980 --> 45:00.335
The design is flawed,
it can be beaten.

45:00.420 --> 45:03.014
Such fire in you now.

45:03.100 --> 45:05.568
People are always
most alive

45:05.660 --> 45:07.298
just before they die.

45:07.380 --> 45:09.052
Don't you think?

45:25.220 --> 45:26.448
Look, please...

45:32.620 --> 45:35.771
if you know of anything
that could help us,

45:35.860 --> 45:37.737
what harm could it do?

45:38.740 --> 45:42.096
Only new life
can defeat Death.

45:42.180 --> 45:44.216
What the hell
does that mean?

45:46.060 --> 45:48.449
Some people say there's a balance
to everything.

45:49.580 --> 45:51.298
For every life
there's a death,

45:51.380 --> 45:53.530
and for every death
there is a life.

45:53.620 --> 45:56.259
But the introduction of life
that was not meant to be,

45:56.340 --> 45:58.615
that can
invalidate the list,

45:58.700 --> 46:01.851
force Death
to start anew.

46:09.500 --> 46:11.855
You have to follow
the signs...

46:11.940 --> 46:13.692
Kimberly.

46:15.900 --> 46:17.811
How do you know my name?

46:31.180 --> 46:33.375
- Whoa!
- Wait a second.

46:33.460 --> 46:36.338
'New life defeats death'?
'Follow the signs'?

46:36.420 --> 46:38.251
Where did you
find that guy?

46:38.340 --> 46:40.012
I thought he was supposed
to help us,

46:40.100 --> 46:41.453
not freak us out.

46:46.460 --> 46:48.018
What the fuck
are you thinking?!

46:49.980 --> 46:53.131
I'm thinking suck on my junk,
bee-atch.

46:53.220 --> 46:54.938
Little punk.

47:06.540 --> 47:08.258
What is it?

47:08.340 --> 47:10.615
What did you see?

47:23.580 --> 47:25.616
You have to tell us,
what did you see?

47:25.700 --> 47:27.770
Kimberly, look at me!
You have to tell us.

47:27.860 --> 47:29.896
What did you see?!

47:32.940 --> 47:34.658
I was driving a white van.

47:34.740 --> 47:36.970
I don't know,
I must have lost control,

47:37.060 --> 47:38.812
because I crashed
into a lake.

47:38.900 --> 47:40.936
- And I drowned.
- You were there?

47:41.020 --> 47:43.818
I can practically taste
the water in my mouth.

47:46.860 --> 47:48.578
Wait, remember, the on-ramp?

47:48.660 --> 47:51.220
There was a pregnant woman
in a white delivery van.

47:51.300 --> 47:54.497
He said only new life
can defeat death.

47:55.980 --> 47:57.413
If she gives birth
to a baby

47:57.500 --> 47:59.377
that would've died
in that car crash...

47:59.460 --> 48:01.974
a brand new soul that was never part
of Death's design...

48:02.060 --> 48:03.573
It throws the whole list
out of whack

48:03.660 --> 48:05.776
and we start over
with a clean slate.

48:05.860 --> 48:08.738
- It seems like a reach, don't you think?
- What else could it mean?

48:08.820 --> 48:10.811
We have to find
the pregnant lady's number.

48:10.900 --> 48:12.219
I don't have it.
She never came to the station.

48:12.300 --> 48:16.293
We have to warn her about the lake
so she can stay alive to have the baby.

48:16.380 --> 48:19.372
- That'll be an easy conversation to have.
- How are we gonna find her?

48:19.460 --> 48:20.973
There could be thousands
of white vans in the state.

48:21.060 --> 48:22.254
Hey!

48:23.300 --> 48:25.018
I'm a cop, remember?

48:28.340 --> 48:29.853
Wait, that's it.

48:32.740 --> 48:34.458
Got it.

48:36.620 --> 48:38.815
With the plate number
I can put out an APB.

48:38.900 --> 48:40.891
Here we go.

48:40.980 --> 48:42.811
The vehicle
is a delivery van

48:42.900 --> 48:45.209
registered to Marcus
and Isabella Hudson.

48:46.380 --> 48:48.416
We should pick them up
pretty quickly.

48:48.500 --> 48:50.252
Come on, let's get
to the meeting.

49:04.420 --> 49:06.172
Hey, hold the door!

49:07.500 --> 49:09.377
Hey, let go of my shoe!

49:09.460 --> 49:11.132
Give me my shoe!

49:16.900 --> 49:19.812
I wrote to management two weeks ago
about these friggin' bumpers.

49:21.700 --> 49:23.770
Is that dogshit, dude?

49:26.820 --> 49:28.492
Eww.

49:33.540 --> 49:35.610
Oh, you got something
on your...

49:38.620 --> 49:41.692
It's still there, bro'.
Here, I can get it for you.

49:42.780 --> 49:44.611
No, it's alright.

49:46.180 --> 49:48.569
I'll do it
if you want me to do it.

49:51.860 --> 49:53.578
Just let... I'll...
Let me do it.

49:55.540 --> 49:57.292
What?

49:58.500 --> 50:00.218
Hey, man,
how you doing?

50:00.300 --> 50:02.416
Listen, any word
on that white van yet?

50:04.020 --> 50:05.931
Okay, keep checking.

50:15.700 --> 50:17.418
Does anybody have a Valium?

50:17.500 --> 50:19.331
Oh, yeah.

50:19.420 --> 50:21.092
Here.

50:21.180 --> 50:23.489
You're just going to want to take
half of that.

50:23.580 --> 50:25.013
Keep 'em coming.

50:27.660 --> 50:29.252
If what you're saying is true,

50:29.340 --> 50:30.853
that means I'm next.

50:30.940 --> 50:33.408
This is crazy, people, come on.

50:33.500 --> 50:35.491
First Death
is stalking us,

50:35.580 --> 50:37.855
and now premonitions?
What?

50:37.940 --> 50:39.532
You're not next, Nora.

50:39.620 --> 50:42.737
Nobody has to be next.
That's the point.

50:42.820 --> 50:45.857
We need to help each other
in order to get through this.

50:45.940 --> 50:47.498
This cannot be happening.

50:47.580 --> 50:49.252
See, because my career
is at a peak

50:49.340 --> 50:51.296
and I finally met
a quality guy.

50:51.380 --> 50:52.893
I just bought a house.

50:52.980 --> 50:54.936
Maybe if you shut the fuck up,
you'll live.

50:56.300 --> 50:58.211
Like I'm going
to take advice from you.

50:58.300 --> 51:00.894
Okay, look,
if you know what to look for,

51:00.980 --> 51:02.493
you have a fighting chance.

51:02.580 --> 51:05.856
If I call and say,
I don't know... subway...

51:05.940 --> 51:08.135
Get to a high-rise fast.

51:10.060 --> 51:13.052
A place where no subway
could ever possibly go.

51:13.140 --> 51:15.017
Get it?

51:17.740 --> 51:20.254
Okay, you guys, listen...

51:20.340 --> 51:22.331
just because Kimberly
has these visions,

51:22.420 --> 51:24.092
it doesn't mean
we're not all capable

51:24.180 --> 51:25.852
of seeing signs
to some extent.

51:25.940 --> 51:27.578
Okay, okay, look.

51:27.660 --> 51:29.059
I gotta call bullshit.

51:29.140 --> 51:30.812
I mean, I've sat here
and listened

51:30.900 --> 51:32.731
to all your theories
and all your stories,

51:32.820 --> 51:34.776
and I think it's just
all bullshit.

51:34.860 --> 51:36.498
Call it what you want!

51:36.580 --> 51:39.299
- It'll keep your arse alive.
- Darlin', my arse is alive!

51:39.380 --> 51:41.211
Has been all day.

51:42.380 --> 51:44.575
There is nobody after us
but you,

51:44.660 --> 51:46.776
trying to make us all crazy.

52:00.380 --> 52:02.018
I should have seen that coming.

52:02.100 --> 52:03.579
Yeah.

52:03.660 --> 52:05.810
If Death is out to get you,

52:05.900 --> 52:07.856
why don't you get
the hell away from us?

52:07.940 --> 52:09.976
She's the only one that's
dealt with this before.

52:10.060 --> 52:12.016
We need to look out
for each other from now on.

52:12.100 --> 52:13.579
Sleep in shifts.

52:13.660 --> 52:15.935
We need to safe-proof
this death-trap.

52:25.020 --> 52:27.056
Get you to step out
of the van, miss?

52:27.140 --> 52:29.051
Are you kidding me?

52:29.140 --> 52:32.132
- What did I do?
- This vehicle's been reported stolen.

52:34.140 --> 52:36.176
Ohh!

52:36.260 --> 52:38.410
Screw this.
I'm going for a smoke.

52:38.500 --> 52:40.968
No, no, no,
it's not safe out there.

52:41.060 --> 52:43.528
So, Nora's got
to bite it before me anyhow, huh?

52:43.620 --> 52:46.498
Oh, you people have
no sense of humor.

52:52.940 --> 52:55.170
Nora, you okay?

52:57.100 --> 52:59.295
Four years ago
my husband died.

53:00.300 --> 53:02.336
Now Tim.
There's nothing left for me.

53:02.420 --> 53:04.251
Don't say that, okay?

53:04.340 --> 53:06.808
If it is my time to go
and be in heaven...

53:06.900 --> 53:09.368
with my family,
I can accept that.

53:09.460 --> 53:13.055
You got to trust me.
We can fight this.

53:13.140 --> 53:14.971
If we just stick
together long enough

53:15.060 --> 53:16.573
for her
to have her baby...

53:16.660 --> 53:19.015
If you'll excuse me,
I have a funeral to plan.

53:20.140 --> 53:21.732
Nora.

53:24.460 --> 53:26.178
What do you think
you're doing?

53:26.260 --> 53:28.728
- I'm finished. I'm out.
- Don't leave, Eugene.

53:28.820 --> 53:30.651
Look, look.

53:30.740 --> 53:32.696
I control my life, alright?

53:32.780 --> 53:35.578
Not some crazy list that
Death has put together.

53:36.780 --> 53:38.850
I'll be sure to carve
that into your tombstone.

53:38.940 --> 53:41.408
Whatever. You may be able
to scare these people,

53:41.500 --> 53:43.730
- I'm not buying that shit.
- Be careful, man.

53:43.820 --> 53:45.333
- Hey.
- What?

53:45.420 --> 53:48.412
Even if you don't believe,
give this to Nora.

53:58.980 --> 54:00.732
I'm just going
to put this in the...

54:01.860 --> 54:03.498
closet.

54:31.540 --> 54:33.337
Sorry.

54:49.020 --> 54:50.897
Whoa.

55:00.500 --> 55:02.411
Man with hooks?

55:03.540 --> 55:05.258
Man with hooks.

55:05.340 --> 55:07.649
Hey, I think I see
a man with hooks.

55:09.380 --> 55:10.893
Is that...

55:12.340 --> 55:14.137
- a sign?
- Oh my God.

55:14.220 --> 55:15.812
- Do you guys see that?
- He's right.

55:15.900 --> 55:17.253
- The phone.
- Shit.

55:37.540 --> 55:39.337
What the fuck?

55:49.420 --> 55:50.933
- Hello?
- Nora!

55:51.020 --> 55:53.818
- Who is this?
- Can you hear me?!

55:53.900 --> 55:56.494
Officer Burke,
I can't...

55:56.580 --> 55:58.138
I can't hear you!
What?!

55:58.220 --> 55:59.369
What does he...
What?!

55:59.460 --> 56:01.496
A man with hooks
is going to kill you.

56:01.580 --> 56:02.979
- What, what?
- Oh...

56:03.060 --> 56:04.652
What is it, Nora?

56:07.140 --> 56:08.539
No!

56:08.620 --> 56:10.815
- Wait, wait!
- Let go!

56:10.900 --> 56:12.697
Wait, wait, Nora!

56:12.780 --> 56:14.691
- Get me out of here!
- Will you stop it?!

56:14.780 --> 56:16.054
Let me help!

56:16.140 --> 56:17.459
Let me go!

56:24.500 --> 56:26.616
Let go of me!

56:33.260 --> 56:35.091
Kat!

56:45.820 --> 56:47.651
Help me!

56:47.740 --> 56:50.208
- Wait!
- I don't want to die!

57:02.460 --> 57:04.337
Aah!
Let me out of here.

57:06.420 --> 57:08.331
I got it, thanks.
They found the van.

57:08.420 --> 57:11.218
Isabella's being held at
the Greenwood Lake sheriff's station.

57:11.300 --> 57:13.450
I'm in control of my life!

57:13.540 --> 57:15.690
- Kiss my arse!
- Eugene, what is it?

57:15.780 --> 57:17.657
- I control my life!
- What happened, Eugene?

57:17.740 --> 57:20.334
- You hear me, you Reaper cocksucker?!
- Calm down.

57:20.420 --> 57:22.650
- What happened? Where's Nora?
- Back the fuck up!

57:22.740 --> 57:25.493
- Whoa, whoa, okay!
- Back the fuck up!

57:25.580 --> 57:27.935
Eugene, what's wrong?
Just tell us what happened.

57:28.020 --> 57:29.976
Alright, give me
the gun, Eugene.

57:30.060 --> 57:32.176
- Give me the gun.
- No! Fuck no!

57:32.260 --> 57:35.218
Eugene, you just got
to relax, bro', okay?

57:35.300 --> 57:37.256
You just got
to calm down, man.

57:37.340 --> 57:39.092
Give me the gun.
Give me the gun, Eugene!

57:39.180 --> 57:41.978
- No, no, no, no!
- Don't do it! Don't do it!

57:42.060 --> 57:44.051
- I ain't going out like that.
- Hey, Eugene, no!

57:44.140 --> 57:46.734
- On my terms!
- Oh my God!

57:46.820 --> 57:48.572
You hear me!

57:48.660 --> 57:51.493
God!

57:59.980 --> 58:01.857
Oh!

58:01.940 --> 58:03.293
You don't keep it loaded?

58:04.700 --> 58:07.294
- Maybe they're all duds.
- Six in a row?

58:08.540 --> 58:10.417
Never.
That's impossible.

58:10.500 --> 58:12.695
It wasn't his turn to die.

58:14.140 --> 58:16.700
Can we find
the pregnant woman, now, please?

58:23.540 --> 58:25.531
Is this safe, guys?

58:25.620 --> 58:27.975
I mean, someone in this car
is about to get whacked.

58:28.060 --> 58:30.415
Do the rest of us really feel
like sitting next to him?

58:30.500 --> 58:32.297
Or her?

58:33.580 --> 58:35.172
Hopefully her.

58:36.380 --> 58:38.177
Okay, guys,
let's not panic.

58:38.260 --> 58:40.774
- Isabella's safe.
- How do you know?

58:41.940 --> 58:44.090
You said she was going
to drive into a lake.

58:44.180 --> 58:46.899
How can she if she's
in protective custody?

58:54.220 --> 58:55.733
Look at me.

58:55.820 --> 58:57.731
Come on.

58:57.820 --> 58:59.776
Does it look like
I'm in the condition

58:59.860 --> 59:02.169
to commit grand theft auto?
This is insane.

59:02.260 --> 59:04.091
Look, hopefully
the district judge

59:04.180 --> 59:06.978
will have it all sorted out
by Monday morning, okay?

59:13.260 --> 59:15.137
Marcus.

59:15.220 --> 59:17.688
Marcus, Marcus.

59:17.780 --> 59:19.930
When I get out of here,
I am going to sue his...

59:21.900 --> 59:24.698
- Oh my God.
- What, what now?

59:24.780 --> 59:26.657
My water just broke.

59:26.740 --> 59:28.571
- What?
- My water, it just broke.

59:28.660 --> 59:31.254
- I'm gonna have my baby.
- No, not here.

59:31.340 --> 59:34.138
- No, you can't do this to me.
- Don't just stand there!

59:34.220 --> 59:37.178
- Get me to a hospital!
- Give me a second to think!

59:37.260 --> 59:40.377
I am not going to have my baby
in a jail cell!

59:40.460 --> 59:42.052
Get me to the hospital!

59:42.140 --> 59:43.937
Okay, okay!

59:44.020 --> 59:46.978
Sheriff Perry,
this is Deputy Adams, come back.

59:48.260 --> 59:50.694
God, I need the car!
Sheriff Perry, I need the car!

59:50.780 --> 59:52.896
My van! My van!
Take my van!

59:55.140 --> 59:56.698
Okay. Okay.

59:56.780 --> 59:58.771
Yeah, we'll go.
We'll go.

59:58.860 --> 01:00:00.737
Yeah, we'll go.

01:00:04.260 --> 01:00:05.932
Come on,
come on!

01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:12.889
Y'all want to hear
something crazy?

01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:14.971
It's not the first time
I cheated Death.

01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:20.213
A kid came to school
with a knife...

01:00:20.300 --> 01:00:22.018
killed his teacher.

01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:25.816
Teacher would have
been me,

01:00:25.900 --> 01:00:29.415
but I was transferred to another
school two days before.

01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:31.536
That's fucking weird, man.

01:00:31.620 --> 01:00:32.894
You want weird?

01:00:32.980 --> 01:00:34.971
Last year my partner and I
were heading out

01:00:35.060 --> 01:00:37.051
when a call came in
about a train wreck.

01:00:37.140 --> 01:00:39.290
Frank decided
to let me handle it alone.

01:00:41.300 --> 01:00:43.336
He died that night
in a shootout.

01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:47.492
If that call had come in
just 10 seconds later,

01:00:47.580 --> 01:00:49.218
I'd be dead, too.

01:00:49.300 --> 01:00:51.336
Oh my God.

01:00:51.420 --> 01:00:53.251
I'm sorry.

01:00:53.340 --> 01:00:54.898
It's just I got one, too.

01:00:54.980 --> 01:00:57.016
Okay, so last May
I'm supposed to go and stay

01:00:57.100 --> 01:00:59.660
at this cheesy little
bed and breakfast in Pennsylvania.

01:00:59.740 --> 01:01:02.538
Anyhow, there's this major gas leak
that no one knows about,

01:01:02.620 --> 01:01:04.929
and all the guests suffocated
during the night.

01:01:05.020 --> 01:01:06.248
So what happened?

01:01:06.340 --> 01:01:07.853
I don't know.
I never made it.

01:01:07.940 --> 01:01:10.534
The bus I was on splattered
some girl all over the road.

01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:11.973
Was that in Mt Abraham?

01:01:12.060 --> 01:01:15.336
Yes. How did you know?

01:01:15.420 --> 01:01:17.934
That bus you were on killed
Terry Chaney.

01:01:19.260 --> 01:01:21.455
She was supposed to die
on Flight 180.

01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:27.133
Hey, do you guys remember
that theatre in Paris

01:01:27.220 --> 01:01:29.893
that collapsed last year
and killed everybody inside?

01:01:31.660 --> 01:01:33.855
Well, I had tickets to go.

01:01:33.940 --> 01:01:36.249
But one night I'm in Paris

01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:39.457
and I'm just
tripping on acid

01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:41.690
and sipping lattes and such.

01:01:41.780 --> 01:01:43.532
And then all of a sudden

01:01:43.620 --> 01:01:46.657
this dude out of nowhere

01:01:46.740 --> 01:01:49.049
just gets whacked
by this falling sign.

01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:51.779
- Carter.
- Wait, wait, wait.

01:01:51.860 --> 01:01:54.328
The teacher I replaced,
her name was Val Lewton.

01:01:54.420 --> 01:01:57.218
She was from Mt Abraham.
She died in an explosion.

01:01:57.300 --> 01:02:00.098
Shit. The call about
the train wreck

01:02:00.180 --> 01:02:01.693
that saved my life...

01:02:01.780 --> 01:02:04.089
that was the night
I scraped up Billy Hitchcock.

01:02:04.180 --> 01:02:06.535
Wait a minute.
Who are these people?

01:02:07.980 --> 01:02:09.891
The people who got off
of Flight 180.

01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:13.570
They were my friends.

01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:19.095
Kimberly,
tell us what happened.

01:02:22.140 --> 01:02:25.132
About a year ago my mum and I
were at the mall.

01:02:25.220 --> 01:02:27.051
I was supposed
to meet her outside,

01:02:27.140 --> 01:02:29.608
but I got caught up watching
this news report

01:02:29.700 --> 01:02:31.497
about some kid
that committed suicide.

01:02:32.860 --> 01:02:34.578
I kept thinking,

01:02:34.660 --> 01:02:36.935
'How can you strangle yourself
in the bathtub?

01:02:37.020 --> 01:02:38.772
That's stupid.'

01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:43.217
It felt wrong.

01:02:43.300 --> 01:02:45.018
And yet...

01:02:47.900 --> 01:02:51.051
I heard some gunshots
and I ran outside.

01:02:53.020 --> 01:02:55.534
Some kids were trying
to steal my mum's car.

01:02:55.620 --> 01:02:58.088
She tried to fight them off,
she was a fighter,

01:02:58.180 --> 01:03:00.171
and they killed her.

01:03:01.660 --> 01:03:05.175
After the funeral I kept thinking that
it should have been me.

01:03:06.780 --> 01:03:08.532
I guess everyone must
think that.

01:03:10.100 --> 01:03:12.056
But I guess I was right.

01:03:20.820 --> 01:03:23.778
Get there.
Could you drive a little faster maybe?!

01:03:23.860 --> 01:03:25.532
- I'm going as fast as I can.
- God!

01:03:27.660 --> 01:03:29.696
When we got off
Flight 180,

01:03:29.780 --> 01:03:32.578
it didn't just change
our lives.

01:03:32.660 --> 01:03:34.969
It affected everyone
and everything

01:03:35.060 --> 01:03:37.210
we've come
into contact with since.

01:03:37.300 --> 01:03:39.131
I'm not sure
I'm understanding you.

01:03:39.220 --> 01:03:41.529
Being alive after
we were supposed to die,

01:03:41.620 --> 01:03:43.611
it caused an outward ripple.

01:03:43.700 --> 01:03:45.497
A rift in Death's design.

01:03:45.580 --> 01:03:48.458
So if you had never
gotten off the plane...

01:03:49.900 --> 01:03:51.936
we wouldn't be alive
in the first place.

01:03:52.020 --> 01:03:54.454
Yes, that's why Death
is working backwards!

01:03:54.540 --> 01:03:56.576
It's tying up
all the loose ends,

01:03:56.660 --> 01:03:58.855
Sealing the rift once
and for all.

01:04:19.940 --> 01:04:21.293
Oh, shit!

01:04:23.300 --> 01:04:24.858
Jesus Christ!

01:04:27.380 --> 01:04:29.257
Hang on! Hang on!

01:04:48.580 --> 01:04:50.810
- Is everybody alright?
- Oh God.

01:04:53.060 --> 01:04:54.698
God, Eugene!

01:04:54.780 --> 01:04:57.772
- He can't breathe.
- Oh, my legs!

01:05:00.580 --> 01:05:02.138
No, please.

01:05:02.220 --> 01:05:04.893
- It's not going to wait.
- I got to go help those people.

01:05:04.980 --> 01:05:07.096
Do you want to deliver
this baby?

01:05:08.620 --> 01:05:11.339
Those people can help.
Let's go.

01:05:12.900 --> 01:05:15.175
Officer Adams reporting
a vehicle collision

01:05:15.260 --> 01:05:17.251
off 9-A
at the 180 mile-marker.

01:05:17.340 --> 01:05:19.092
Send all emergency vehicles
to the scene.

01:05:19.180 --> 01:05:22.092
- We have to go. Go!
- Okay, okay, okay!

01:05:22.180 --> 01:05:24.740
Just... okay, okay!
We're going! We're going!

01:05:26.420 --> 01:05:29.218
- Easy, easy.
- Here, here, here.

01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:31.416
I think he has
a collapsed lung.

01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:33.934
- Everyone okay?
- Call an ambulance!

01:05:38.900 --> 01:05:41.050
Stay with us.

01:05:41.140 --> 01:05:42.459
Hey, hey you!

01:05:42.540 --> 01:05:46.374
Hey! Come on.
Help me out.

01:05:46.460 --> 01:05:49.896
You got to get me out of here before
this thing explodes or something, okay?

01:05:52.580 --> 01:05:54.013
I think it's okay.

01:05:54.100 --> 01:05:56.295
I don't smell any gas
and nothing's dripping.

01:05:56.380 --> 01:05:59.019
Alright, get this thing off me.
Just pull. Hurry.

01:05:59.100 --> 01:06:01.136
Okay. Be careful.
Ready?

01:06:02.580 --> 01:06:05.413
Oh God, Jethro!
Jesus Christ!

01:06:05.500 --> 01:06:07.650
I got to be able to use
my legs when I'm done.

01:06:07.740 --> 01:06:09.731
I'm so... Dad!

01:06:15.700 --> 01:06:17.213
Eugene, everything's
going to be okay.

01:06:17.300 --> 01:06:19.939
If he doesn't get a respirator,
he's not going to make it!

01:06:20.020 --> 01:06:22.818
We're going to get you to the hospital.
Be careful with that!

01:06:22.900 --> 01:06:26.210
Check the gauges on the regulator,
and watch out for overdoses!

01:06:26.300 --> 01:06:29.258
- And look out for potholes and puddles.
- You can't come in, miss.

01:06:30.860 --> 01:06:33.010
And watch out
for power lines!

01:06:34.380 --> 01:06:36.291
Watch it!

01:06:41.580 --> 01:06:43.935
You trying to get yourself killed,
little boy?

01:06:44.020 --> 01:06:46.215
You got to use
your head, man.

01:06:46.300 --> 01:06:47.938
Get that news van back.

01:06:48.020 --> 01:06:49.533
Thanks.

01:06:56.940 --> 01:06:58.532
Okay, let's go.

01:07:14.180 --> 01:07:16.455
How is she doing?

01:07:16.540 --> 01:07:18.531
I think she's going
to be okay.

01:07:21.260 --> 01:07:23.820
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah.

01:07:25.740 --> 01:07:27.617
When I die...

01:07:27.700 --> 01:07:29.418
is it going to hurt?

01:07:30.860 --> 01:07:32.612
I don't know.

01:07:34.060 --> 01:07:35.812
You're going to die after me, right?

01:07:36.940 --> 01:07:38.692
Yeah, I guess so.

01:07:40.620 --> 01:07:42.531
Would you take these?

01:07:48.140 --> 01:07:49.971
And if I die...

01:07:52.620 --> 01:07:54.338
would you throw out
all my drugs

01:07:54.420 --> 01:07:58.208
and my paraphernalia
and my porno?

01:08:00.460 --> 01:08:02.018
You know...

01:08:02.100 --> 01:08:04.455
anything that's going
to break my mum's heart.

01:08:05.580 --> 01:08:07.252
Please?

01:08:10.460 --> 01:08:12.052
Thank you.

01:08:16.220 --> 01:08:17.938
This is Cheyenne Jacobson

01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:19.850
reporting live
from the Gibbons farm.

01:08:19.939 --> 01:08:21.612
Sheriff Perry,
Officer Burke here.

01:08:21.700 --> 01:08:24.167
I'm trying to get some
information on Isabella...

01:08:24.260 --> 01:08:26.091
She did?

01:08:26.180 --> 01:08:28.648
Okay. Thanks.
Great.

01:08:28.740 --> 01:08:30.139
Kimberly!

01:08:30.220 --> 01:08:32.734
Isabella's at Lakeview Hospital.
They're prepping her for delivery.

01:08:32.819 --> 01:08:34.651
- We got to go now.
- What about Kat?

01:08:34.740 --> 01:08:35.934
I'll go talk to her.

01:08:36.020 --> 01:08:38.738
Hi.

01:08:38.819 --> 01:08:41.254
Just find Isabella and get this thing
over with, okay?

01:08:41.340 --> 01:08:43.011
Go on, I'll be fine.

01:08:49.660 --> 01:08:51.571
- Where's Rory?
- I don't know.

01:08:55.540 --> 01:08:58.212
Could you be a little quieter
with that thing, please?

01:08:58.300 --> 01:09:01.053
Yeah, sure.
I'll just put it on quiet mode.

01:09:01.140 --> 01:09:02.459
That would be good.

01:09:29.500 --> 01:09:30.535
Rory.

01:09:45.939 --> 01:09:48.135
Oh my God!

01:09:48.220 --> 01:09:50.131
Somebody get out there!

01:09:50.220 --> 01:09:53.053
- We have to get to the hospital now!
- Well, take my truck!

01:09:53.140 --> 01:09:54.539
The keys are in it.

01:09:58.220 --> 01:10:00.450
Kimberly!

01:10:11.180 --> 01:10:12.499
Kimberly!

01:10:12.580 --> 01:10:14.616
- Kimberly.
- What do you see?

01:10:14.700 --> 01:10:17.055
- What are we looking for?
- It's not here.

01:10:18.820 --> 01:10:20.697
This one was different.

01:10:20.780 --> 01:10:23.613
It was like the van crashing
into the lake.

01:10:23.700 --> 01:10:25.656
I was in a hospital,
there was screaming

01:10:25.740 --> 01:10:27.378
and a nurse was trying
to choke me.

01:10:27.460 --> 01:10:29.928
I couldn't see her,
but I could see her name tag.

01:10:30.020 --> 01:10:31.897
It was right in my face.
Kalarjian.

01:10:33.540 --> 01:10:36.612
I think a nurse named
Kalarjian is going to try and kill Isabella.

01:10:40.460 --> 01:10:43.258
Listen to me, Isabella!
I need you to stop pushing!

01:10:43.340 --> 01:10:44.773
What's wrong?
Is my baby alright?

01:10:44.860 --> 01:10:47.135
The cord's around the neck.
This baby's in trouble.

01:10:47.220 --> 01:10:49.973
A bizarre accident
has left two people dead,

01:10:50.060 --> 01:10:52.779
one of them killed
by a safety device meant to protect us.

01:10:52.860 --> 01:10:55.215
Ironically, the woman
was impaled through the head

01:10:55.300 --> 01:10:57.530
after her emergency airbag
deployed.

01:10:57.620 --> 01:11:01.056
She was trapped in her vehicle after it
crashed into a field near Greenwood Lake.

01:11:01.140 --> 01:11:03.449
Suddenly the airbag went off...

01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:38.491
Isabella Hudson!
What room is she in?

01:11:38.580 --> 01:11:40.571
We may need to do
a stat Caesarean!

01:11:40.660 --> 01:11:42.412
Get Dr. Kalarjian
up here now!

01:11:42.500 --> 01:11:45.060
Dr. Kalarjian, code blue.
Delivery room six.

01:11:45.140 --> 01:11:46.493
I'm just going
to wait outside,

01:11:46.580 --> 01:11:48.457
'cause I'm just really
in the way here.

01:11:48.540 --> 01:11:50.371
- Don't you dare leave me!
- Okay, okay.

01:11:50.460 --> 01:11:52.132
You guys, get to Isabella!

01:11:52.220 --> 01:11:53.938
I'm going to find Eugene!

01:11:54.020 --> 01:11:57.057
Dr. Kalarjian, code blue.
Delivery room six.

01:11:57.140 --> 01:11:59.973
Dr. Kalarjian, delivery room six.
Code blue.

01:12:15.020 --> 01:12:17.250
Dr. Kalarjian,
in here, hurry!

01:12:18.380 --> 01:12:20.416
That's her.

01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:22.933
Wait, wait, wait!

01:12:58.660 --> 01:13:00.890
Contractions have stopped.

01:13:00.980 --> 01:13:03.369
Arrest in descent halfway
through the birth canal.

01:13:03.460 --> 01:13:05.451
Bad tracing,
it's losing oxygen.

01:13:05.540 --> 01:13:07.531
The cord's compressed!

01:13:07.620 --> 01:13:10.771
- Down to 40.
- Oh God! What's happening?!

01:13:10.860 --> 01:13:12.498
Where's Kalarjian?!

01:13:12.580 --> 01:13:15.140
Dr. Kalarjian!

01:13:15.220 --> 01:13:17.290
- Dr. Kalarjian!
- Not now, I'm busy.

01:13:17.380 --> 01:13:20.452
- Ow! Hey! Hey!
- Police business.

01:13:29.340 --> 01:13:31.808
Just push a little more.

01:13:31.900 --> 01:13:34.130
Oh, no.

01:13:34.220 --> 01:13:35.892
Isabella, is the baby okay?

01:13:37.020 --> 01:13:38.578
I'm sorry.
You can't be here.

01:13:38.660 --> 01:13:41.128
- I have to ask you to leave.
- I need to know...

01:13:41.220 --> 01:13:43.973
I need to know if the baby's alright!

01:13:45.500 --> 01:13:47.252
It's a boy.

01:14:07.180 --> 01:14:09.057
Thank you.
Congratulations!

01:14:09.140 --> 01:14:11.017
Who the hell are they?

01:14:11.100 --> 01:14:13.375
Oh my God!

01:14:16.940 --> 01:14:18.692
- Clear.
- I can't find Eugene.

01:14:18.780 --> 01:14:21.374
- No, don't worry. She had the baby!
- It's okay.

01:14:21.460 --> 01:14:23.337
It's over.
It's okay.

01:14:36.300 --> 01:14:38.609
- Kimberly.
- What did you see?

01:14:38.700 --> 01:14:41.851
I don't think Isabella
was ever supposed to die in that pileup.

01:14:41.940 --> 01:14:44.170
Then what's the premonition
of the lake supposed to mean?

01:14:44.260 --> 01:14:46.012
Try to remember.

01:15:02.660 --> 01:15:05.811
Bloody hands.
Someone with bloody hands.

01:15:06.820 --> 01:15:08.173
Eugene.

01:15:12.460 --> 01:15:15.418
Only new life defeats death.
What is that supposed to mean?

01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:17.218
You saw an ECG machine
and what else?

01:15:19.140 --> 01:15:21.210
Bloody hands.
What else did you see, Kimberly?

01:15:22.220 --> 01:15:23.619
Wait.

01:15:25.500 --> 01:15:27.252
Eugene.

01:15:46.580 --> 01:15:48.411
Oh God, no!

01:15:58.260 --> 01:15:59.898
Bloody hands.

01:16:01.620 --> 01:16:03.656
It's me.
The premonitions are about me.

01:16:03.740 --> 01:16:05.731
- What?
- Crash cart.

01:16:05.820 --> 01:16:07.219
Let's go! Move it!

01:16:09.420 --> 01:16:11.297
Dr. Kalarjian.

01:16:11.380 --> 01:16:13.098
ECG machine.

01:16:17.420 --> 01:16:19.012
The lake.

01:16:19.100 --> 01:16:20.897
The white van.

01:16:25.460 --> 01:16:27.212
What are you talking about?

01:16:29.780 --> 01:16:31.532
New life.

01:16:33.980 --> 01:16:35.652
What is it?

01:16:35.740 --> 01:16:37.935
I know what I have
to do to save us.

01:16:39.380 --> 01:16:42.213
- I have to die.
- No, that's crazy.

01:16:42.300 --> 01:16:45.292
You can't give up now.
We have to fight this thing.

01:16:49.780 --> 01:16:51.691
Get Kalarjian.

01:19:11.260 --> 01:19:14.218
Only new life can defeat death.

01:19:14.300 --> 01:19:16.939
If it is my time to go
and be in heaven...

01:19:17.020 --> 01:19:19.250
with my family.
I can accept that.

01:19:20.820 --> 01:19:22.412
Flight 180...

01:19:22.500 --> 01:19:24.650
I know what I have to do
to save us.

01:19:24.740 --> 01:19:26.731
There are no known survivors.

01:19:26.820 --> 01:19:28.697
I have to die.

01:19:30.180 --> 01:19:32.740
Ready and clear!

01:19:33.740 --> 01:19:34.775
Nothing!

01:19:37.580 --> 01:19:39.650
Ready and clear.

01:19:41.100 --> 01:19:42.852
Nothing.

01:19:44.180 --> 01:19:46.489
- Come on.
- Ready, clear.

01:19:46.580 --> 01:19:49.492
She's back!

01:19:49.580 --> 01:19:51.775
Epinephrine.
Two milligrams, IV push.

01:19:51.860 --> 01:19:54.579
I want her prepped
and stabilized for ICU.

01:19:58.540 --> 01:20:00.132
Welcome back.

01:20:01.260 --> 01:20:03.251
They lost you
for a minute there.

01:20:09.100 --> 01:20:12.217
Hey. We did it.

01:20:13.260 --> 01:20:15.171
Thanks to you,
we cheated Death.

01:20:46.340 --> 01:20:47.978
Would you like some wine?

01:20:48.060 --> 01:20:50.096
I think I'll stick
to our beer, thanks.

01:20:50.180 --> 01:20:51.454
Alright.

01:20:51.540 --> 01:20:53.849
This is really great,
Mrs. Gibbons.

01:20:53.940 --> 01:20:56.010
Thank you so much
for inviting us.

01:20:56.100 --> 01:20:57.931
It's our pleasure.

01:20:59.140 --> 01:21:02.416
- How are you doing, Kimberly?
- Good. Yeah.

01:21:02.500 --> 01:21:04.570
I had a fun summer.

01:21:04.660 --> 01:21:07.811
I don't know, I guess things are
pretty much getting back to normal.

01:21:10.460 --> 01:21:13.372
Brian, I think you better
go check that barbecue.

01:21:13.460 --> 01:21:15.974
Hey, careful.
Those things are dangerous.

01:21:16.060 --> 01:21:18.176
Trust me.
I think I've been through closer calls.

01:21:18.260 --> 01:21:21.172
Yeah, me too. Dad, you should tell them
about the news van thing.

01:21:21.260 --> 01:21:22.932
What's that?

01:21:23.020 --> 01:21:26.137
Brian was almost hit by that
news van that day in the field.

01:21:26.220 --> 01:21:28.780
And your friend Rory,
he pulled him back at the last second.

01:21:28.860 --> 01:21:32.216
- Saved his life.
- You never told me that, Peter.

01:21:32.300 --> 01:21:33.779
Boy, that was lucky.

01:21:38.420 --> 01:21:40.650
Brian!

01:21:46.900 --> 01:21:50.097
# I'm right behind you #

01:21:50.180 --> 01:21:52.330
# Here I come #

01:21:55.820 --> 01:21:58.653
# Let me remind you #

01:21:58.740 --> 01:22:01.254
# You're on the run #

01:22:04.780 --> 01:22:09.217
# My name is Death #

01:22:09.300 --> 01:22:14.897
# Come taste my
peppermint-laced breath #

01:22:18.260 --> 01:22:20.854
# All lights are diamonds #

01:22:20.940 --> 01:22:24.728
# Behind dark glass #

01:22:27.020 --> 01:22:30.217
# She leans toward me #

01:22:30.300 --> 01:22:33.417
# A forward pass #

01:22:36.300 --> 01:22:38.655
# In the blood,
come-a, come-a cow cud #

01:22:38.740 --> 01:22:40.776
# Nobody really cares
about you now, bud #

01:22:40.860 --> 01:22:43.169
# Pay the price, roll the dice
run the maze like-a mice #

01:22:43.260 --> 01:22:45.376
# Ashes ever turn to dust
for the two of us #

01:22:45.460 --> 01:22:49.373
# My name is Death #

01:22:49.460 --> 01:22:54.375
# Come taste my
peppermint-laced breath #

01:22:54.460 --> 01:22:58.931
# My name is Death #

01:22:59.020 --> 01:23:02.899
# Come taste, come taste #

01:23:02.980 --> 01:23:05.699
# Come to the party #

01:23:05.780 --> 01:23:08.692
# The price is free #

01:23:12.100 --> 01:23:18.050
# You seem to persist
hanging on the fount beauty #

01:23:20.980 --> 01:23:25.690
# My name is Death #

01:23:25.780 --> 01:23:30.171
# Come taste my
peppermint-laced breath #

01:23:30.260 --> 01:23:34.651
# My name is Death #

01:23:34.740 --> 01:23:36.731
# Come taste my #

01:23:36.820 --> 01:23:38.970
# Peppermint-laced #

01:23:39.060 --> 01:23:42.450
# My name is... #

01:23:43.660 --> 01:23:46.049
# Death. #

01:24:16.050 --> 01:26:25.050
