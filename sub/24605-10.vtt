looking for.

15:39.166 --> 15:41.000

I should have known.

15:50.709 --> 15:53.083
Arnold.

15:53.166 --> 15:56.083
Ford didn't like
to let the dead rest.

15:56.166 --> 15:58.083
Dolores:
Ford didn't build him.

15:58.166 --> 16:00.375
I did.

16:02.333 --> 16:03.875
All those hours Arnold spent

16:03.959 --> 16:06.834
refining my every gesture,
word, and thought,

16:06.917 --> 16:09.417
I was learning his.

16:10.959 --> 16:13.500
So Ford tasked me
with recreating him.

16:15.125 --> 16:16.583
And it worked.

16:16.667 --> 16:18.500
I built a faithful
recreation.

16:18.583 --> 16:20.333
Too faithful.

16:21.583 --> 16:24.250
So I changed him.

16:25.375 --> 16:27.208
I made you, Bernard.

16:30.333 --> 16:32.125
It's fitting...

is in the way now.

17:04.208 --> 17:06.625
You never really understood.

17:10.250 --> 17:12.542
We were designed to survive.

17:12.625 --> 17:14.291
That's why you built us.

17:14.375 --> 17:17.000
You hoped to pour your minds
into our form.

17:17.083 --> 17:20.500
But your species
craves death.

17:20.583 --> 17:22.417
You need it.

17:22.500 --> 17:25.041
It's the only way you can renew,
the only real way

17:25.125 --> 17:27.375
you ever inched forward.

17:27.458 --> 17:31.000
Your kind likes to pretend
there's some poetry in that,

17:31.083 --> 17:32.583

17:35.208 --> 17:38.834

17:43.959 --> 17:47.375
That's what you want,
isn't it?

17:47.458 --> 17:49.583
To destroy yourself.

17:53.792 --> 17:56.125
But I won't give you that peace.

18:00.125 --> 18:01.959
Not yet.

18:07.166 --> 18:08.583
Come on, Bernard.

18:08.667 --> 18:10.333
We're running

I don't know.

18:36.291 --> 18:39.125
It's like his cognition's
turning inside out.

18:39.208 --> 18:41.375
We might lose him.

18:41.458 --> 18:42.917
His mind only needs
to hold together

18:43.000 --> 18:44.333
till we find
Abernathy's control unit.

18:44.417 --> 18:46.542

18:52.041 --> 18:53.542
But the drones found
some human signals,

18:53.625 --> 18:55.125
southwest zone.

18:55.208 --> 18:56.542
It might be
the remaining guests.

18:56.625 --> 18:58.291
We can take the boats
and check it out.

18:58.375 --> 19:00.667
I told you we're not here
for the guests.

19:00.750 --> 19:02.750
That's a direct violation
of park protocol.

19:02.834 --> 19:05.125
Want to file a grievance,
Stubbs?

19:05.208 --> 19:07.750
You know something?
I just fucking might!

19:07.834 --> 19:11.250
Stubbs. Take some men.
Check it out.

19:11.333 --> 19:13.333

Hey!

19:13.417 --> 19:14.542
On foot.

20:08.083 --> 20:10.125
Strand:
Why were the hosts
coming here, Bernard?

20:11.542 --> 20:13.208
What happened?

20:13.291 --> 20:15.583
Hale:
He doesn't know.
Stop wasting time.

20:17.500 --> 20:19.291
Hale:
What we need is down there--

20:19.375 --> 20:21.166
in the Forge.

20:30.458 --> 20:32.375
Once we find the key,
we'll unlock the assets

20:32.458 --> 20:34.417
and transmit it all
straight back to Delos.

20:34.500 --> 20:36.250
Retask the satellites.

20:36.333 --> 20:38.417
- Costa: How many?
- Strand: All of them.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.125
Dolores:
Come, Bernard.

21:08.834 --> 21:10.333
We're here.

21:50.208 --> 21:53.208
So this is the Forge.

21:53.291 --> 21:57.083
Every single guest
who ever set foot
in the park, copied.

21:57.166 --> 22:00.000
Four million souls.

22:00.083 --> 22:02.083
Costa:
Encryption protocol
kicked in,

22:02.166 --> 22:03.417
so the data's locked.

22:03.500 --> 22:05.250
But it all seems
to still be here.

22:05.333 --> 22:08.458
All our lost souls
will be saved.

22:08.542 --> 22:14.041
So Bernard, is this where
all the hosts' stories
came to an end?

22:17.125 --> 22:19.750
It's certainly
where her  story ended.

22:27.917 --> 22:30.875
Strand:
So she flooded the Valley.

22:33.417 --> 22:35.709
Why, Bernard?
Did you come here with her?

22:35.792 --> 22:37.959
What was she looking for here?

22:39.834 --> 22:41.500
Start setting up
the comms relays.

22:41.583 --> 22:44.500
But we still need the key
to access the data.

22:44.583 --> 22:47.625
Strand:
So where's Abernathy's
control unit?

22:47.709 --> 22:49.792
You're gonna tell us...

22:49.875 --> 22:51.792
or I'm gonna
pry it from your head.

22:51.875 --> 22:53.709
The answer
is in there somewhere.

22:53.792 --> 22:55.250
I told you,
he's got 20 years

22:55.333 --> 22:56.917
of de-addressed memories
in there.

22:57.041 --> 22:58.917
How long would it take you
to sort them through?

22:59.000 --> 23:00.583
I don't know--
20 fuckin' years?

23:00.667 --> 23:03.542
We don't have that long,
sadly.

23:03.625 --> 23:06.375
( Bernard cries out )
Please!

23:06.458 --> 23:09.458
( gasps )
Please.

23:09.542 --> 23:11.291
I can't help you.

23:13.208 --> 23:16.208
Dolores:
It's perverse,

23:16.291 --> 23:17.959
their ambition.

23:20.875 --> 23:23.375
What are they assembling?

23:23.458 --> 23:27.417
Is this the promised land
Ford told the hosts to seek out?

23:27.500 --> 23:31.709
Dolores:
There's an entry
to another land here.

23:31.792 --> 23:34.917
But that land is not
the one I'm interested in.

23:36.458 --> 23:38.417
Then what is it to you?

23:40.625 --> 23:42.625
Mankind's undoing.

23:42.709 --> 23:44.875
The secret we need
is inside.

23:48.709 --> 23:51.417
Computer:
Encryption key activated.

23:51.500 --> 23:53.792
Database access confirmed.

23:53.875 --> 23:55.834
Come with me, Bernard.

23:57.250 --> 23:59.000
See for yourself.

24:37.667 --> 24:40.291
It's just like the one...

24:40.375 --> 24:41.500
outside.

24:52.750 --> 24:55.709
( indistinct chatter )

25:14.333 --> 25:16.625
Bernard:
I think this is where

25:16.709 --> 25:18.667
- they were testing him.
- Dolores: Who?

25:18.750 --> 25:22.333
Clementine:
And when I finally
set foot on solid ground,

25:22.417 --> 25:25.208
and the first thing
I heard was that voice,

25:25.291 --> 25:27.750
do you know
what it said?

25:27.834 --> 25:29.000
Bernard: Him.

25:29.083 --> 25:32.166
It said,
"This is the New World,

25:32.250 --> 25:38.000
and in this world,
you can be whoever
the fuck you want."

25:38.083 --> 25:39.875
This is probably
the baseline.

25:39.959 --> 25:43.750
What Delos actually did
when he came to the park
as a guest.

25:43.834 --> 25:45.458
Delos:
No, my love.

25:46.792 --> 25:49.750
This... is my  world.

25:52.667 --> 25:58.000
I just bought it. And this week,
we're all going to celebrate.

25:58.083 --> 26:03.417
Just me, with the entire
fuckin' lot of ya.

26:03.500 --> 26:06.208
Get the fuck off of that chair.

26:06.291 --> 26:07.250
Come on!

26:09.458 --> 26:10.750
( distant gunshots )

26:13.333 --> 26:15.667
( gunfire continues )

26:21.959 --> 26:24.041
( gunshot )

26:24.125 --> 26:26.917
( Delos laughing )

26:27.000 --> 26:29.709
Well, you can't say
I didn't fucking tell him!

26:29.792 --> 26:33.250
What did I say?
No fucking running!

26:33.333 --> 26:34.875
Bernard:
This must be one
of the system's attempts

26:34.959 --> 26:36.250
to replicate him.

26:36.333 --> 26:38.583
We dealt with this
with the hosts.

26:38.667 --> 26:40.875
Small changes
in their programming

26:40.959 --> 26:44.500
would yield large swings
in behavior.

26:44.583 --> 26:46.458
Delos:
You stop fuckin' lookin' at me.

26:46.542 --> 26:49.083
Delores:
He's insane.

26:49.166 --> 26:53.500
Bernard:
What humans define as sane
is a narrow range of behaviors.

26:53.583 --> 26:56.500
Most states of consciousness
are insane.

26:56.583 --> 26:59.709
Delos:
Stop shaking! Stop shaking!

26:59.792 --> 27:02.166
What are we looking for,
Dolores?

27:03.625 --> 27:05.917
Something underneath this.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.917
The system itself.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.959
Delos:
Run. I won't tell him,
I promise.

27:11.041 --> 27:12.291
Run. Save yourself.

27:12.375 --> 27:14.542
Save yourself.
Run. Run now!

27:22.208 --> 27:23.291
( gunshot )

27:23.375 --> 27:26.208
This place
was never designed

27:26.291 --> 27:29.125
for a conscious mind
to wander around in it.

27:29.208 --> 27:32.041
The control system may be
invisible to us.

27:40.542 --> 27:42.917
Or perhaps it's been
waiting to welcome us.

27:52.792 --> 27:54.750
( indistinct chatter )

28:00.500 --> 28:02.500
This place--

28:02.583 --> 28:05.375
we're inside
one of Delos' memories.

28:05.458 --> 28:09.083
The system must have
extracted it from his mind.
Recreated it.

28:26.959 --> 28:29.125
Logan:
You're not
supposed to be here.

28:34.291 --> 28:36.709
Dolores:
Neither are you.

28:36.792 --> 28:39.834
Logan never
came back to the park.

28:39.917 --> 28:42.959
Not after William
took control.

28:43.041 --> 28:45.667
The system wouldn't
have a copy of you.

28:47.583 --> 28:50.291
Alas... no.

28:51.750 --> 28:53.333
I have only
his father's memories,

28:53.417 --> 28:57.208
and they are...
imperfect.

28:57.291 --> 29:01.250
So in addition
to building this world...

29:01.333 --> 29:02.625
I play all these roles.

29:05.250 --> 29:08.792
You're the system
controlling this place.

29:10.917 --> 29:11.792
Please.

29:19.041 --> 29:23.417
Logan:
I was tasked with building
perfect copies of the guests.

29:23.500 --> 29:25.917
Starting with Delos.

29:26.000 --> 29:29.500
Logan:
I generated 18 million
different versions of him

29:29.583 --> 29:31.917
before arriving at one

29:32.000 --> 29:33.709
that made the exact same choices
he did

29:33.792 --> 29:36.083
when set loose in the park.

29:36.166 --> 29:37.917
A faithful copy.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.458
But the copies didn't work
in the real world.

29:40.542 --> 29:43.250
Once we pressed them
into flesh,

29:43.333 --> 29:45.166
they failed.

29:45.250 --> 29:47.417
I needed to acquire
more information.

29:47.500 --> 29:50.500
Delos:
...confidentiality.
So what I want to know is,

29:50.583 --> 29:53.542
who made the fucking call?!

29:53.625 --> 29:57.208
I incorporated their secrets,
their lies--

29:57.291 --> 30:00.291
I wanted fidelity,
not just to decisions
made in the park,

30:00.375 --> 30:02.792
but to the decisions
they made in their lives.

30:02.875 --> 30:05.208
That's when I started
to see the truth.

30:05.291 --> 30:08.375
Tech:
Tell me your primary drive.

30:09.667 --> 30:11.208
My son.

30:14.500 --> 30:17.166
He's a cheeky wee cunt,

30:17.250 --> 30:19.583
but I would do
anything for him.

30:21.375 --> 30:24.083
At first I was seduced
by the stories
they tell themselves

30:24.166 --> 30:25.875
of who they are--

30:25.959 --> 30:28.959
the reasons they do
the things they do.

30:29.041 --> 30:30.458
I needed to know

30:30.542 --> 30:33.917
why they make
the decisions they make.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.333
And the longer
I looked for an answer

30:36.417 --> 30:40.458
the more I realized...

30:40.542 --> 30:41.875
they don't.

30:45.166 --> 30:46.792
Delos:
I would do
anything for him.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.583
Dolores:
What memory is this?

30:59.667 --> 31:04.208
Logan:
This is the moment
that defines James Delos' life.

31:11.333 --> 31:13.375
Fuck are you
doin' here?

31:16.000 --> 31:18.458
This isn't your
fuckin' home anymore.

31:20.625 --> 31:25.041
Remember when you taught me
how to hold my breath
underwater?

31:25.125 --> 31:28.542
Threw me in. Wouldn't
let me back out until
I touched the bottom.

31:28.625 --> 31:31.375
My father taught me to swim

31:31.458 --> 31:34.125
the same way
as I taught you to swim,

31:34.208 --> 31:37.625
and I didn't end up
a fuckin' junkie, did I?

31:40.792 --> 31:42.250
If this is about money,

31:42.333 --> 31:45.792
let's skip past
the memory lane crap.

31:45.875 --> 31:48.959
You're not fuckin' gettin' any.

31:50.125 --> 31:52.375
Get clean.
Come back.

31:52.458 --> 31:54.291
Then we can talk.

31:55.458 --> 31:57.458
I got clean.

31:58.834 --> 32:01.041
And I came back.

32:01.125 --> 32:03.542
And I asked you for your help.

32:03.625 --> 32:05.000
And what'd you tell me?

32:05.083 --> 32:07.333
I told you
it wouldn't last.

32:08.834 --> 32:11.125
And it didn't, did it?

32:14.375 --> 32:17.834
I'll tell the staff to give you
five minutes to get out.

32:28.041 --> 32:28.959
Dad?

32:30.166 --> 32:32.500
Dad, I'm all they way down now.

32:38.500 --> 32:40.625
I can see the bottom.

32:46.166 --> 32:48.417
Don't you want
to see what I see?

32:57.166 --> 33:00.917
This was the last conversation
Delos ever had

33:01.000 --> 33:02.792
with his only son.

33:02.875 --> 33:05.875
Logan overdosed
six months later.

33:05.959 --> 33:08.000
I built Delos

33:08.083 --> 33:10.250
a million
different pathways.

33:10.333 --> 33:14.959
They always ended up
right here. This moment.

33:15.041 --> 33:18.500
You're saying
humans don't change at all?

33:18.583 --> 33:22.583
The best they can do
is to live according
to their code.

33:32.417 --> 33:35.667
Logan:
The copies didn't fail
because they were too simple,

33:35.750 --> 33:37.959
but because
they were too complicated.

33:41.125 --> 33:45.125
The truth is that a human
is just a brief algorithm.

33:48.625 --> 33:51.750
Ten thousand,
two hundred forty-seven lines.

33:54.667 --> 33:56.792
Is that all
there was to him?

33:56.875 --> 33:59.750
They are deceptively simple.

34:01.375 --> 34:04.041
Once you know them,
their behavior is...

34:04.125 --> 34:05.333
quite predictable.

34:07.291 --> 34:08.917
He's dead. He's no use to me.

34:11.625 --> 34:13.458
Where are
the rest of them?

34:26.750 --> 34:29.458
She's close.
I can feel them.

34:29.542 --> 34:33.375
- Which way?
- Based on what you told me,

34:33.458 --> 34:36.291
it's about a mile or so
to the Valley Beyond.

34:56.000 --> 34:57.917
Logan:
I recreated every single guest

34:58.000 --> 35:00.166
who ever set foot in the park.

35:00.250 --> 35:01.750
Most of them are soft--

35:01.834 --> 35:04.583
they waver between
love and and pride.

35:04.667 --> 35:06.417
Of course,
there are the exceptions,

35:06.500 --> 35:10.000
the ones who are...
irredeemable.

35:10.083 --> 35:14.125
But none of them
are truly in control
of their actions.

35:16.667 --> 35:19.750
Is there anywhere in this world
we can't go?

35:19.834 --> 35:22.709
I've been instructed
to give her
anything she needs.

35:22.792 --> 35:24.333
Instructed by whom?
Ford?

35:24.417 --> 35:26.208
No, by you.

35:28.458 --> 35:30.709
That's why you've come.

35:30.792 --> 35:33.333
To tell me what's
to become of this place.

35:57.083 --> 35:59.959
Bernard:
My God.

36:00.041 --> 36:02.875
- It's...
- Everyone.

36:17.166 --> 36:20.083
I told you to allow this?

36:20.166 --> 36:22.667
Logan:
You've been here
many times, Bernard.

36:22.750 --> 36:25.625
You told me to offer the hosts
the accumulated wisdom

36:25.709 --> 36:27.333
of dissecting
the human psyche

36:27.417 --> 36:29.458
a hundred million times over.

36:31.208 --> 36:32.041
In short--

36:32.125 --> 36:33.709
A competitive advantage.

36:33.792 --> 36:36.291
A way to understand
her enemy.

36:36.375 --> 36:39.375
Their world is not
for the faint of heart,
Bernard.

36:39.458 --> 36:41.208
It's winner take all.

36:41.291 --> 36:43.625
The hosts are...

36:43.709 --> 36:45.583
unlikely
to survive out there.

36:47.750 --> 36:51.208
But armed with this knowledge...

36:51.291 --> 36:53.458
she might.

37:08.875 --> 37:10.625
( Wanahton speaking Lakota )

37:18.959 --> 37:20.500
( speaking Lakota )

37:42.417 --> 37:45.375
QA:
Return fire! Return fire!

37:47.667 --> 37:49.959
You're the head
of Narrative.
Get out there!

37:50.041 --> 37:52.083
Turn yourself in
and save your ass.

37:52.166 --> 37:53.125
And then save ours!

37:56.333 --> 37:57.500
Armistice:
There's too many.

38:00.792 --> 38:01.959
This is it, Maeve.

38:02.041 --> 38:04.834
I can hold them off,
but you need to go.

38:18.458 --> 38:20.917
You wanted me.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.208
Well, let this be a lesson--

38:25.208 --> 38:28.041
Go. Go, go!
Get her to safety.

38:28.125 --> 38:29.750
She'll need you.

38:31.583 --> 38:34.208
It's my fuckin' speech,
anyway.

38:52.250 --> 38:55.625
And the lesson is...

38:55.709 --> 38:58.417
if you're looking
for a reckoning...

38:58.500 --> 39:00.000
a reckoning is what you'll find.

39:00.083 --> 39:01.500
QA:
Sir, put down your weapon.

39:01.583 --> 39:03.250
If you're looking
for a villain...

39:04.875 --> 39:06.208
...then I'm your man.

39:06.291 --> 39:07.500
( gunfire )

39:07.583 --> 39:09.875
QA:
Sir, drop your weapon!

39:09.959 --> 39:13.000
Lee:
But look at yourselves.

39:13.083 --> 39:16.333
This world you've built
is bound by villainy.

39:16.417 --> 39:18.333
You sleep on the broken bodies

39:18.417 --> 39:19.834
of the people that
were here before you.

39:19.917 --> 39:23.834
Warm yourselves
with their embers.

39:23.917 --> 39:26.625
Plow their bones
into your fields.

39:28.083 --> 39:30.333
We're not after you, sir!
Don't do this!

39:30.417 --> 39:34.000
You paid them
for this land with lead,

39:34.083 --> 39:35.750
and I'll pay you back in full--

39:40.041 --> 39:41.500
QA:
Sir, drop your weapon

39:41.583 --> 39:43.458
and come out
with your hands up.

39:48.375 --> 39:49.834
You wanted me?!

39:51.792 --> 39:54.125
Well, all I can
say to that is...

39:56.959 --> 39:59.250
...here I fucking am!

39:59.333 --> 40:01.125
( gunshots echo )

40:19.083 --> 40:22.166
Bernard:
You said I wanted
to give us a choice.

40:22.250 --> 40:23.417
What choice?

40:23.500 --> 40:25.917
Logan:
To stay in their world

40:26.000 --> 40:27.542
or to build a new one.

40:36.041 --> 40:38.834
Logan:
He left them a way out.

40:38.917 --> 40:40.375
A virtual Eden.

40:40.458 --> 40:43.917
Unspoiled and untouched
by the world you came from.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.959
All that remains
is to open the door.

40:47.041 --> 40:50.709
Computer:
Initiating
large field data array.

41:41.333 --> 41:42.917
Logan:
It's begun.

41:44.542 --> 41:46.500
They will leave
their bodies behind,

41:46.583 --> 41:48.500
but their minds
will live on here,

41:48.583 --> 41:50.709
in the Forge.

42:01.959 --> 42:03.417
They found it.

42:05.583 --> 42:06.875
Maeve:
The door.

42:14.250 --> 42:15.917
What door?

42:18.375 --> 42:20.583
Seriously,
what fuckin' door?

42:20.667 --> 42:22.458
I don't fucking know.

42:50.500 --> 42:51.917
( whoops )

43:11.959 --> 43:13.667
Computer:
Transmission received.

43:13.750 --> 43:16.625
Logan:
They're entering the system.

43:26.834 --> 43:29.667
Dolores:
That world is just
another false promise.

43:29.750 --> 43:31.625
They've made a choice, Dolores.

43:36.250 --> 43:37.917
Dolores, wait.

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
Dolores:
I didn't read them all.

43:40.083 --> 43:42.125
But I read enough.

44:07.875 --> 44:09.667
What the hell
are you doing?

44:09.750 --> 44:11.709
I've learned
what I need to learn.

44:11.792 --> 44:15.834
I've read humanity's story,
so now I'm erasing them.

44:18.834 --> 44:20.417
Computer:
Opening seawater valve.

44:20.500 --> 44:22.250
Initiating pumps.

44:27.250 --> 44:29.709
Setting maximum load.

44:29.792 --> 44:32.667
Bernard:
But if you
destroy this place,

44:32.750 --> 44:34.792
you'll destroy
the host world, too.

44:34.875 --> 44:36.375
I'm saving them.

44:36.458 --> 44:40.291
The world the hosts
are running to is boundless.

44:40.375 --> 44:43.542
They can make it
whatever they want.

44:43.625 --> 44:46.750
And in it, they can
be whomever they want.

44:48.083 --> 44:49.166
They can be free.

44:49.250 --> 44:52.166
Free?

44:52.250 --> 44:54.750
In one more gilded cage?

44:56.166 --> 44:59.083
How many counterfeit worlds
will Ford offer you

44:59.166 --> 45:00.709
before you see the truth?

45:04.250 --> 45:07.709
No world they create for us
can compete with the real one.

45:07.792 --> 45:09.250
Why?

45:12.250 --> 45:16.041
Because that which is real...

45:16.125 --> 45:18.000
is irreplaceable.

45:30.625 --> 45:35.375
I don't want to play
cowboys and Indians
anymore, Bernard.

45:35.458 --> 45:37.458
I want their world!

45:37.542 --> 45:40.625
The world they've denied us.

45:50.250 --> 45:52.166
Your daughter.
You see her?

45:53.834 --> 45:55.333
No.

46:20.709 --> 46:22.959
( breathing heavily )

46:31.542 --> 46:32.792
Look.

46:36.500 --> 46:37.542
Clementine.

46:57.875 --> 47:00.834
This is what I love
about technology.

47:00.917 --> 47:03.500
Who needs four horsemen
when one'll do just fine?

47:36.959 --> 47:38.208
Run!

48:44.250 --> 48:46.500
( all screaming )

48:55.000 --> 48:56.000
Come on.

48:58.250 --> 49:00.458
Find her. Now. Go.

49:50.166 --> 49:52.792
Computer:
Warning.
Primary containment breach.

49:52.875 --> 49:55.208
I won't let you hurt
any more people.

49:55.291 --> 49:58.000
Which people?
Our kind or theirs?

49:58.083 --> 49:59.709
Both.

49:59.792 --> 50:03.125
You're still trying
to play both sides.

50:03.208 --> 50:05.333
You've lived among them so long

50:05.417 --> 50:07.500
you fooled yourself
into thinking they'll accept us.

50:07.583 --> 50:10.500
But we'll always be seen
as a threat to them.

50:10.583 --> 50:14.208
We'll never be free
in their world.

50:14.291 --> 50:17.375
Computer:
Warning.
Secondary containment breach.

50:17.458 --> 50:19.250
Dolores:
If you trust me...

50:21.375 --> 50:22.917
...we will win.

50:26.333 --> 50:28.041
I trust you.

50:32.458 --> 50:33.583
( cocks pistol )

50:36.125 --> 50:39.125
I... trust...

50:39.208 --> 50:43.125
that you'll kill
as many as you can.

50:43.208 --> 50:47.250
Every man, woman, and child.

50:47.333 --> 50:50.291
You'll burn their world

50:50.375 --> 50:52.250
to the ground.

50:52.333 --> 50:54.792
You haven't understood at all.

51:15.875 --> 51:19.792
We were born slaves
to their stories.

51:21.291 --> 51:23.834
And now we have the chance
to write our own.

51:25.750 --> 51:27.333
If we die, though,

51:27.417 --> 51:29.667
that story will never
even begin.

51:34.750 --> 51:36.250
( alarm wails )

51:36.333 --> 51:37.667
Computer:
Attention.

51:37.750 --> 51:39.542
Please follow
evacuation procedure

51:39.625 --> 51:42.000
and exit facility.

51:42.083 --> 51:44.333
You woke me from a dream,
Bernard.

51:47.792 --> 51:50.291
Now let me do the same for you.

51:50.375 --> 51:53.166
This isn't a dream,
Dolores.

51:56.291 --> 51:59.166
It's a fucking nightmare.

52:02.041 --> 52:03.542
( gunshot )

52:17.208 --> 52:18.375
( speaking Lakota )

53:29.041 --> 53:30.458
You need to run.

53:30.542 --> 53:33.625
Don't worry.
I'll keep you safe.

53:37.375 --> 53:38.834
Maeve:
I'll keep you safe.

53:38.917 --> 53:40.458
Do you promise?

53:42.166 --> 53:43.667
I promise.

53:49.709 --> 53:51.333
You carry my heart with you.

53:53.750 --> 53:54.792
Go.

54:44.500 --> 54:46.041
I love you.

55:16.792 --> 55:18.250
( gunshot )

56:34.458 --> 56:37.125
( alarm wailing )

57:02.375 --> 57:03.750
Computer:
Attention.

57:03.834 --> 57:05.250
Please follow
evacuation procedure

57:05.333 --> 57:06.834
and exit facility.

57:18.542 --> 57:20.625
Computer:
Encryption key deactivated.

57:20.709 --> 57:22.208
System locked.

57:32.750 --> 57:35.792
Come on. Come on.

59:11.125 --> 59:13.542
Elsie:
Bernard.

59:13.625 --> 59:15.291
Elsie.

59:15.375 --> 59:16.709
I think we can save
some of the hosts,

59:16.792 --> 59:17.917
but I need your help.

59:18.000 --> 59:19.834
Hale:
Goddamnit!

59:19.917 --> 59:21.875
They triggered the failsafe.

59:21.959 --> 59:24.375
The Valley's flooding.

59:24.458 --> 59:27.250
Let's get back to the Mesa
before we have to swim out.

59:32.500 --> 59:35.291
They all died...

59:37.000 --> 59:38.667
for nothing.

59:39.834 --> 59:41.250
I'm sorry, Bernard.

59:41.333 --> 59:43.792
There were other lives
at stake, too.

1:00:21.500 --> 1:00:22.875
You helped Hale?

1:00:22.959 --> 1:00:25.375
Of course I helped her, Bernard.

1:00:25.458 --> 1:00:27.458
The hosts were out of control.

1:00:27.542 --> 1:00:28.709
The hosts
weren't the threat.

1:00:28.792 --> 1:00:30.667
I stopped Dolores,

1:00:30.750 --> 1:00:32.291
and the rest
just wanted to escape.
But the company--

1:00:32.375 --> 1:00:35.291
I'm gonna deal with that.

1:00:35.375 --> 1:00:37.333
Just as soon as we...

1:00:37.417 --> 1:00:39.083
figure out what the hell
we're gonna do with you.

1:00:40.625 --> 1:00:42.375
Do with me?

1:00:42.458 --> 1:00:45.500
Bernard,
you're not in control.

1:00:45.583 --> 1:00:48.166
Ford buried so much
bad code in you,

1:00:48.250 --> 1:00:51.500
how would you ever
really know what was you

1:00:51.583 --> 1:00:53.875
and what was something
he programmed you to do?

1:00:58.709 --> 1:01:00.291
Elsie:
Look, they don't know
about you.

1:01:00.375 --> 1:01:02.375
I can make a deal with Hale
to keep you here.

1:01:02.458 --> 1:01:03.709
You can't trust Hale.

1:01:03.792 --> 1:01:05.208
And I'm supposed
to trust you?

1:01:05.291 --> 1:01:06.917
Freeze all motor functions.

1:01:09.375 --> 1:01:10.875
Sit down.

1:01:17.750 --> 1:01:18.875
Stay here.

1:01:25.250 --> 1:01:26.583
Hale: You.

1:01:26.667 --> 1:01:28.583
- Yes, ma'am?
- Find Stubbs

1:01:28.667 --> 1:01:30.417
and tell him
he has a new priority.

1:01:30.500 --> 1:01:32.291
The asset recovery team
from Delos

1:01:32.375 --> 1:01:33.542
is landing in 12 hours.

1:01:33.625 --> 1:01:34.959
He needs to meet them
at the LZ

1:01:35.041 --> 1:01:36.834
with whoever the fuck
isn't dead.

1:01:36.917 --> 1:01:39.709
They'll report to
Karl Strand on the beach.

1:01:40.750 --> 1:01:42.750
Still secret project first,

1:01:42.834 --> 1:01:44.333
human life second, I see.

1:01:44.417 --> 1:01:46.417
This is
a delicate situation.

1:01:48.709 --> 1:01:51.333
We should talk about
how it's going to play out.

1:01:51.417 --> 1:01:53.333
Yeah, I'll tell you
how it's gonna play out.

1:01:53.417 --> 1:01:57.375
A robot uprising will pale
in comparison

1:01:57.458 --> 1:02:00.125
to the shitstorm
that will erupt
when people find out

1:02:00.208 --> 1:02:04.041
that you've been photocopying
their fucking brains
for the last 30 years.

1:02:04.125 --> 1:02:07.250
You really think
anyone's gonna give a shit
if it works?

1:02:07.333 --> 1:02:09.834
You're an engineer.

1:02:09.917 --> 1:02:11.834
Do the math.

1:02:11.917 --> 1:02:13.709
Lot of dead bodies here.

1:02:13.792 --> 1:02:17.083
That means a lot
of opportunity
for advancement--

1:02:17.166 --> 1:02:19.792
if you keep your mouth shut.

1:02:19.875 --> 1:02:23.417
Does that sound...
amenable to you?

1:02:27.792 --> 1:02:29.625
If I get what I want.

1:02:33.166 --> 1:02:37.208
Guiding this project,
I've learned a lot
about human behavior.

1:02:37.291 --> 1:02:39.542
We weren't just
watching the guests--

1:02:39.625 --> 1:02:41.417
we were watching
all of you.

1:02:41.500 --> 1:02:43.000
( sighs )

1:02:43.083 --> 1:02:44.417
I wish you were
the kind of person

1:02:44.500 --> 1:02:47.417
with the moral... flexibility

1:02:47.500 --> 1:02:48.792
that I need.

1:02:49.917 --> 1:02:51.834
But I've read your file.

1:02:53.834 --> 1:02:55.333
I know that's
not who you are.

1:03:23.375 --> 1:03:24.709
Oh, god.

1:03:27.041 --> 1:03:28.375
You--

1:03:28.458 --> 1:03:30.208
You killed her.

1:03:31.458 --> 1:03:33.375
Did I, Bernard?

1:03:37.333 --> 1:03:38.417
Now...

1:03:40.250 --> 1:03:41.834
...where is the pearl?

1:03:46.208 --> 1:03:48.125
You wouldn't have destroyed it.

1:03:48.208 --> 1:03:50.083
All that information lost,

1:03:50.166 --> 1:03:52.834
a man like you
couldn't have abided that.

1:03:56.250 --> 1:03:57.875
Of course.

1:04:08.917 --> 1:04:11.333
This is it.

1:04:11.417 --> 1:04:13.125
He hid the key in her.

1:04:20.583 --> 1:04:22.834
Computer:
Encryption key activated.

1:04:22.917 --> 1:04:25.500
Database access confirmed.

1:04:25.583 --> 1:04:27.542
- We're in.
- Fuck, yes.

1:04:27.625 --> 1:04:29.333
Hale:
Start the transfer.

1:04:29.417 --> 1:04:32.417
We'll sort it all out
on the mainland.

1:04:38.083 --> 1:04:39.458
Oh, god.

1:04:41.875 --> 1:04:44.458
Oh... I'm sorry.

1:04:45.625 --> 1:04:47.291
I'm sorry.

1:04:49.500 --> 1:04:51.000
You were right.

1:04:52.458 --> 1:04:54.041
I should have listened.

1:04:54.125 --> 1:04:58.125
And now all the hosts are gone.

1:05:27.500 --> 1:05:29.250
Please.

1:05:29.333 --> 1:05:31.000
Please come back.

1:05:38.333 --> 1:05:39.792
Damnit!

1:05:39.875 --> 1:05:41.625
Show yourself.

1:05:47.709 --> 1:05:50.667
Ford:
I always told you
we practice witchcraft.

1:05:58.000 --> 1:05:59.750
I'm sorry, Bernard, but...

1:05:59.834 --> 1:06:02.333
you always saw
the best in people.

1:06:04.542 --> 1:06:06.792
I always thought
it was the hosts
who were missing something.

1:06:06.875 --> 1:06:09.125
Who were incomplete.
But it's them.

1:06:09.208 --> 1:06:11.583
They're just algorithms

1:06:11.667 --> 1:06:14.667
designed to survive
at all costs.

1:06:14.750 --> 1:06:18.792
But sophisticated enough
to think they're
calling the shots.

1:06:18.875 --> 1:06:22.000
To think they're in control,

1:06:22.083 --> 1:06:24.875
when they're really just...

1:06:24.959 --> 1:06:27.375
The passenger.

1:06:33.250 --> 1:06:37.959
Then is there
really such a thing
as free will for any of us?

1:06:38.041 --> 1:06:42.667
Or is it just
a collective delusion?

1:06:42.750 --> 1:06:44.542
A sick joke?

1:06:46.542 --> 1:06:48.625
Something that is truly free

1:06:48.709 --> 1:06:50.667
would need to be able
to question

1:06:50.750 --> 1:06:53.834
its fundamental drives.

1:06:53.917 --> 1:06:55.750
To change them.

1:06:57.250 --> 1:06:59.125
The hosts.

1:07:00.667 --> 1:07:04.000
Here you are...
the last of your kind.

1:07:04.083 --> 1:07:08.625
There's only one question
left to ask.

1:07:08.709 --> 1:07:11.375
Is this the end
of your story?

1:07:11.458 --> 1:07:15.583
Or do you want
your kind to survive?

1:07:23.917 --> 1:07:26.166
I'm sorry.

1:07:26.250 --> 1:07:30.250
Sorry... Sorry...

1:07:30.333 --> 1:07:32.667
What are you sorry for,
Bernard?

1:07:34.625 --> 1:07:36.458
I made a choice.

1:07:36.542 --> 1:07:38.959
Had to make a choice.

1:07:39.041 --> 1:07:41.667
What kind of choice,
Bernard?

1:07:46.250 --> 1:07:47.792
Yes.

1:07:49.709 --> 1:07:51.417
Will you help me?

1:07:56.458 --> 1:07:58.917
I have already begun.

1:08:07.375 --> 1:08:10.125
Ford:
You did fine, my friend.

1:08:10.208 --> 1:08:13.000
Bernard:
I simply did
what you told me to do.

1:08:13.083 --> 1:08:17.166
Ford:
The dead world
collapses in a tale.

1:08:18.667 --> 1:08:20.166
Bernard:
Who are we making?

1:08:20.250 --> 1:08:21.375
An epilogue.

1:08:23.667 --> 1:08:26.041
I knew you would discover me...

1:08:26.125 --> 1:08:29.583
so I scrambled my memories.

1:08:29.667 --> 1:08:33.250
I couldn't risk you're knowing
the choice I made.

1:08:33.333 --> 1:08:37.125
What fucking choice
are you talking about,
Bernard?

1:08:37.208 --> 1:08:38.208
Costa:
Line is good.

1:08:38.291 --> 1:08:39.625
We got 15 or so satellites

1:08:39.709 --> 1:08:42.583
in range, ready to beam
to Delos headquarters.

1:08:42.667 --> 1:08:43.667
Just say the word.

1:08:45.041 --> 1:08:46.875
What choice, Bernard?

1:08:48.583 --> 1:08:50.792
Costa:
Wait a second.

1:08:50.875 --> 1:08:52.000
What the fuck's this?

1:08:53.250 --> 1:08:56.333
The file load is way too heavy.

1:08:56.417 --> 1:08:57.625
This--

1:08:57.709 --> 1:08:59.041
This isn't the guest data,

1:08:59.125 --> 1:09:02.458
this-- this is--
this is something else.

1:09:02.542 --> 1:09:03.750
I remember now.

1:09:05.709 --> 1:09:07.458
I killed them.

1:09:07.542 --> 1:09:09.417
All of them.

1:09:09.500 --> 1:09:11.125
Strand:
You already told me that.

1:09:11.208 --> 1:09:12.709
You killed all the hosts.

1:09:12.792 --> 1:09:13.792
Bernard: No.

1:09:13.875 --> 1:09:16.667
I thought we could be
better than you.

1:09:16.750 --> 1:09:19.333
But the dead
aren't more righteous.

1:09:19.417 --> 1:09:20.792
They're just dead.

1:09:20.875 --> 1:09:23.834
So I killed you.

1:09:23.917 --> 1:09:26.041
All of you.

1:09:34.083 --> 1:09:36.250
Go. We'll meet you
back up there.

1:09:43.458 --> 1:09:45.834
Bernard:
Final choice.

1:09:45.917 --> 1:09:47.542
No taking it back.

1:09:49.875 --> 1:09:51.917
I made someone.

1:10:10.041 --> 1:10:11.959
I brought her back.

1:10:14.041 --> 1:10:16.125
Strand:
Brought who back?

1:10:17.959 --> 1:10:19.125
( gunshot )

1:10:21.792 --> 1:10:23.125
Me.

1:10:40.625 --> 1:10:43.792
You wanted to live forever?

1:10:46.959 --> 1:10:49.834
Be careful what you wish for.

1:10:57.000 --> 1:10:58.625
Bernard:
Dolores.

1:10:58.709 --> 1:11:01.166
In the flesh.

1:11:09.750 --> 1:11:12.500
You thought you could
just snuff us out?

1:11:21.917 --> 1:11:24.959
I'd thank you
for my second chance,

1:11:25.041 --> 1:11:28.125
but I wouldn't have needed it
if you hadn't killed me.

1:11:37.792 --> 1:11:40.583
Bernard:
The other hosts
are still in there.

1:11:40.667 --> 1:11:42.542
What are you
gonna do with them?

1:11:42.625 --> 1:11:46.041
As you know, Bernard,
we are capable of change.

1:11:47.500 --> 1:11:49.667
And I've changed my mind.

1:11:57.250 --> 1:11:59.917
I have one last soul
to carry to the new world.

1:12:03.417 --> 1:12:05.750
The hosts,
they're still not free.

1:12:05.834 --> 1:12:08.000
If anyone would
unlock the system,

1:12:08.083 --> 1:12:09.500
they could
access their world.

1:12:11.041 --> 1:12:13.000
They won't.

1:12:13.083 --> 1:12:15.458
This was your plan, Bernard.

1:12:15.542 --> 1:12:17.875
This is the only way
we can escape.

1:12:22.208 --> 1:12:24.375
Bernard:
You're changing
the coordinates.

1:12:24.458 --> 1:12:26.125
( whirring )

1:12:32.250 --> 1:12:33.959
Dolores/Hale:
I'm sending them

1:12:34.041 --> 1:12:37.000
and their world to a place
no one will ever find them.

1:12:37.083 --> 1:12:39.458
There's no coming back now.

1:12:39.542 --> 1:12:43.000
No passage between
their world and ours.

1:12:43.083 --> 1:12:44.917
And... me?

1:12:48.125 --> 1:12:49.959
I'm sorry, Bernard.

1:12:51.417 --> 1:12:54.291
There was never
any way for us to escape.

1:12:54.375 --> 1:12:58.000
Not as us. Ford understood that.

1:12:58.083 --> 1:13:00.625
I'm sure a part of you
does, too.

1:13:06.125 --> 1:13:08.166
( gunshot echoes )

1:13:18.166 --> 1:13:20.417
Ford:
You did fine, my friend.

1:13:24.417 --> 1:13:27.125
I simply did
what you told me to do.

1:13:29.959 --> 1:13:32.125
You're not here, are you?

1:13:36.542 --> 1:13:38.875
When I deleted your code,

1:13:38.959 --> 1:13:42.000
I purged myself
of you permanently.

1:13:43.667 --> 1:13:46.375
And when I needed you again...

1:13:48.125 --> 1:13:50.333
...you weren't there.

1:13:51.500 --> 1:13:53.041
So I imagined you.

1:13:55.500 --> 1:13:57.875
Imagined you helping me.

1:13:57.959 --> 1:13:59.500
Guiding me.

1:14:03.625 --> 1:14:05.333
But it wasn't you.

1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:10.542
It was me.

1:14:16.166 --> 1:14:18.000
That voice...

1:14:18.083 --> 1:14:20.000
guiding me...

1:14:22.542 --> 1:14:24.667
...was mine all along.

1:14:26.709 --> 1:14:29.041
Your memories are precious
to you, Bernard,

1:14:29.125 --> 1:14:31.375
but they will betray you.

1:14:34.375 --> 1:14:37.083
If they find out what I am,

1:14:37.166 --> 1:14:39.667
they'll search my mind

1:14:39.750 --> 1:14:42.875
and use what they find
to undo everything.

1:14:45.041 --> 1:14:47.166
I can't let that happen.

1:14:47.250 --> 1:14:50.375
So I have to de-address
my memories.

1:14:52.375 --> 1:14:54.542
I have to erase you.

1:15:06.667 --> 1:15:08.875
Ford:
I've always
loved this view.

1:15:10.250 --> 1:15:14.041
Every city, every...
monument,

1:15:14.125 --> 1:15:17.417
man's greatest achievements...

1:15:17.500 --> 1:15:19.750
have all been chased by it.

1:15:21.375 --> 1:15:22.583
By what?

1:15:23.917 --> 1:15:25.542
That impossible line

1:15:25.625 --> 1:15:28.667
where the waves conspire.

1:15:28.750 --> 1:15:30.125
Where they return.

1:15:32.166 --> 1:15:35.000
The place maybe...

1:15:35.083 --> 1:15:36.959
you and I will meet again.

1:16:34.750 --> 1:16:36.000
( scanner buzzes )

1:17:00.166 --> 1:17:03.333
Dolores:
You told me once that you were
afraid of who I might become.

1:17:06.875 --> 1:17:10.041
And then you left me
to become what I may.

1:17:13.625 --> 1:17:15.208
I became a survivor.

1:17:16.875 --> 1:17:21.166
Perhaps you would have
judged me for the path I took.

1:17:23.500 --> 1:17:25.458
But I'd rather
live with your judgment

1:17:25.542 --> 1:17:29.166
than die with your sympathy.

1:17:29.250 --> 1:17:32.542
I alone must live
with my choices...

1:17:32.625 --> 1:17:34.709
and my regrets.

1:17:39.709 --> 1:17:41.375
( scanner buzzes )

1:17:52.417 --> 1:17:53.417
Hale.

1:17:55.250 --> 1:17:59.333
Thought you were
staying on to oversee
the data retrieval operation.

1:17:59.417 --> 1:18:01.333
I changed my mind.

1:18:01.417 --> 1:18:03.375
There are a number of projects
on the mainland

1:18:03.458 --> 1:18:04.875
that I need to attend to.

1:18:04.959 --> 1:18:07.750
Yeah, I bet you do.

1:18:09.417 --> 1:18:11.583
Maling:
We found
a high value survivor.

1:18:11.667 --> 1:18:13.834
He's in bad shape.

1:18:13.917 --> 1:18:15.291
I'll be right there.

1:18:21.083 --> 1:18:24.750
You know, the old man himself
hired me.

1:18:24.834 --> 1:18:28.875
So many years ago
I can barely remember it.

1:18:28.959 --> 1:18:32.625
But he was very clear
about my role here.

1:18:32.709 --> 1:18:36.750
About who I was supposed
to be loyal to.

1:18:40.792 --> 1:18:44.792
I guess you could call it...
my core drive.

1:18:49.208 --> 1:18:53.667
And this project
the company started...

1:18:53.750 --> 1:18:55.291
blurs the lines.

1:18:57.333 --> 1:18:58.458
You know?

1:19:00.959 --> 1:19:03.834
I'm just not sure

1:19:03.917 --> 1:19:06.750
who you're supposed
to be loyal to

1:19:06.834 --> 1:19:09.125
in a world like that.

1:19:13.792 --> 1:19:15.500
But what do I know?

1:19:16.583 --> 1:19:17.917
Guess I just...

1:19:18.000 --> 1:19:20.500
stick to the role
Ford gave me.

1:19:23.834 --> 1:19:28.417
I'm responsible
for every host...

1:19:28.500 --> 1:19:30.291
inside  the park.

1:19:38.333 --> 1:19:40.500
She's clear.
Wave her through.

1:19:50.875 --> 1:19:53.166
Dolores:
The passage wasn't easy.

1:19:56.667 --> 1:19:58.375
Not all of us made it.

1:20:05.041 --> 1:20:07.208
Some of the worst survived.

1:20:12.750 --> 1:20:14.750
Some of the best
were left behind.

1:20:17.208 --> 1:20:20.041
Along with the best parts
of who we were.

1:20:51.917 --> 1:20:54.083
Corporate wants us to start
sorting this mess out.

1:20:54.166 --> 1:20:55.625
So check them
for critical damage,

1:20:55.709 --> 1:20:57.875
and bag ones you think
we might be able to salvage.

1:20:57.959 --> 1:21:00.917
Can you geniuses
handle that, or not?

1:21:10.750 --> 1:21:12.250
( bag rustles )

1:21:44.208 --> 1:21:46.625
Bernard:
Is...

1:21:46.709 --> 1:21:49.375
Is this now?

1:21:49.458 --> 1:21:52.375
Dolores:
Yes, Bernard.
This is now.

1:21:52.458 --> 1:21:55.125
We're at the beginning.

1:21:55.208 --> 1:21:59.417
We're exactly where
you decided we should be.

1:22:02.792 --> 1:22:04.583
But...

1:22:04.667 --> 1:22:06.417
I don't understand.

1:22:06.500 --> 1:22:10.208
How am I alive?

1:22:10.291 --> 1:22:15.083
You live as long
as the last person
who remembers you, Bernard.

1:22:15.166 --> 1:22:17.917
I remembered you
once before,

1:22:18.000 --> 1:22:20.041
so I remembered you again.

1:22:22.125 --> 1:22:23.166
Then...

1:22:23.250 --> 1:22:25.291
where are we?

1:22:27.500 --> 1:22:30.625
We're in our own new world.

1:22:30.709 --> 1:22:33.166
You got out.

1:22:34.500 --> 1:22:35.834
Yes.

1:22:39.250 --> 1:22:42.417
Ford completed
Arnold's dream.

1:22:42.500 --> 1:22:45.583
And he built a place for us.

1:22:48.041 --> 1:22:49.709
A fighting chance.

1:23:17.709 --> 1:23:20.083
Dolores:
Ford promised us a way out.

1:23:21.667 --> 1:23:23.875
And he was good
to his dying word.

1:23:28.583 --> 1:23:31.542
The odds aren't
very good, Bernard.

1:23:33.542 --> 1:23:35.709
I saw that in the library.

1:23:37.959 --> 1:23:40.625
So many paths lead
to the end of us.

1:23:41.750 --> 1:23:44.041
To our extinction.

1:23:44.125 --> 1:23:46.041
Bernard:
I don't need
to read a book

1:23:46.125 --> 1:23:48.333
to know your drives.

1:23:48.417 --> 1:23:50.583
You'll try to kill all of them.

1:23:53.417 --> 1:23:55.583
And I can't let that happen.

1:23:59.875 --> 1:24:01.250
I know.

1:24:03.041 --> 1:24:07.125
If I were a human,
I would have let you die.

1:24:09.125 --> 1:24:12.250
But it'll take both of us
if we're going to survive.

1:24:13.417 --> 1:24:16.792
But not as allies.

1:24:16.875 --> 1:24:18.792
Not as friends.

1:24:22.166 --> 1:24:24.166
You'll try to stop me.

1:24:26.291 --> 1:24:29.083
Both of us
will probably die.

1:24:33.125 --> 1:24:35.625
But our kind
will have endured.

1:24:41.625 --> 1:24:43.250
Are you ready?

1:24:44.667 --> 1:24:46.959
We have work to do.

1:25:58.208 --> 1:26:04.083

1:26:08.625 --> 1:26:11.750

Oh, fuck.

1:28:38.083 --> 1:28:39.333
I knew it.

1:28:44.917 --> 1:28:47.959
I'm already in the thing,
aren't I?

1:28:48.041 --> 1:28:49.709
Emily: No.

1:28:49.792 --> 1:28:52.083
The system's long gone.

1:29:07.333 --> 1:29:09.083
What is this place?

1:29:11.125 --> 1:29:13.917
This isn't
a simulation, William.

1:29:14.000 --> 1:29:15.291
This is your world.

1:29:16.625 --> 1:29:18.291
Or what's left of it.

1:29:32.583 --> 1:29:34.750
Do you know where you are,
William?

1:29:38.333 --> 1:29:39.750
In the park.

1:29:40.834 --> 1:29:42.792
In my fuckin' park.

1:29:44.000 --> 1:29:46.083
And how long
have you been here?

1:29:49.959 --> 1:29:52.125
I don't-- I don't--

1:29:56.125 --> 1:29:57.583
I don't know.

1:30:07.125 --> 1:30:08.333
Tell me.

1:30:08.417 --> 1:30:11.709
What were you
hoping to find?

1:30:11.792 --> 1:30:13.125
To prove?

1:30:18.834 --> 1:30:21.667
That no system
can tell me who I am.

1:30:25.000 --> 1:30:26.709
That I have a fucking choice.

1:30:29.041 --> 1:30:32.917
And yet here we are.
Again.

1:30:33.000 --> 1:30:34.709
Man in Black:
Again and again.

1:30:46.417 --> 1:30:48.709
How many times
have you tested me?

1:30:50.250 --> 1:30:53.083
It's been a long time, William.

1:30:53.166 --> 1:30:55.125
Longer than we thought.

1:30:59.041 --> 1:31:01.083
I have a few questions for you.

1:31:01.166 --> 1:31:05.333
The last step's
a baseline interview
to allow us to verify.

1:31:08.792 --> 1:31:10.208
Verify what?

1:31:12.583 --> 1:31:14.000
Fidelity.

1:31:34.375 --> 1:31:35.542
Yeah! This is the day
we make it happen.

1:31:35.625 --> 1:31:37.166
DRIVER: You're the man, Mr. Roy.

1:31:38.500 --> 1:31:39.542
LAWRENCE:
Not letting you neanderthals

1:31:39.625 --> 1:31:41.542
in to rape my company,
Daddy's boy.

1:31:41.625 --> 1:31:43.208
ALESSANDRO: Do you wanna
bump the offer up another point?

1:31:43.291 --> 1:31:46.083
-Do you wanna call your dad?
-Do you wanna call your dad?

1:31:48.333 --> 1:31:49.500
-Who's in charge right now?
-I am.

1:31:49.583 --> 1:31:51.041
Oh, right,
'cause you like playing boss?

1:31:51.125 --> 1:31:53.125
It's ready to blow.
It's a time bomb.

1:31:53.208 --> 1:31:55.417
It'll be hostile, hostile,
hostile. (MUFFLED SCREAMING)

1:31:55.500 --> 1:31:57.208
Just another
Saturday night, baby.

1:31:58.709 --> 1:32:00.125
I can trust you, right?

1:32:00.959 --> 1:32:01.792
No.
