16:46.416 --> 16:48.400
than with my glasses.

16:48.433 --> 16:50.000
Oh, look,

16:50.033 --> 16:51.283
my toy s.U.V.

16:51.316 --> 16:54.300
Look how perfect
in every detail.

16:54.333 --> 16:59.083
So this is what it is like
to have super-perfect vision.

17:04.233 --> 17:06.283
My plant is teeming
with life

17:06.316 --> 17:10.133
I once
could only see
with a microscope.

17:12.400 --> 17:15.233
Ha ha! I wonder
if anyone will notice

17:15.266 --> 17:17.216
my new eyes.

17:26.216 --> 17:28.150
Dad,
do you notice

17:28.183 --> 17:32.183
anything different
about--aah!

17:32.216 --> 17:34.083
You got new pajamas?

17:34.116 --> 17:37.083
U-U-Ugly.

17:37.116 --> 17:38.433
Well, sorry.

17:38.466 --> 17:40.400
Next time,
I'll make sure

17:40.433 --> 17:42.316
I'm showered
and shaved

17:42.350 --> 17:44.366
for his highness.

17:50.100 --> 17:51.416
Good morning.

17:51.450 --> 17:53.083
Breakfast.

17:53.116 --> 17:56.366
Where's my
good morning kiss?

17:56.400 --> 17:59.183
[Smooching]

18:03.316 --> 18:07.150
All my family's tiny flaws
and imperfections

18:07.183 --> 18:08.483
magnified a thousandfold

18:09.016 --> 18:10.466
by my new vision.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.083
Ugh!

18:12.116 --> 18:14.233
Certainly we were never meant
to see this clearly.

18:14.266 --> 18:17.350
I will have to call on
all my inner fortitude

18:17.383 --> 18:19.416
to withstand the ugliness
in the world

18:19.450 --> 18:22.066
I can now see
with such brutal clarity.

18:22.100 --> 18:25.233
Quit talking to yourself
and eat your breakfast.

18:25.266 --> 18:26.383
Your favorite--

18:26.416 --> 18:28.250
sausage and eggs.

18:28.283 --> 18:29.400
[Buzzing]

18:29.433 --> 18:30.383
Blecch!

18:30.416 --> 18:33.083
What's the matter,
son? Not hungry?

18:33.116 --> 18:35.266
Oh-ho!
Give it to me.

18:35.300 --> 18:38.083
I'll eat it.

18:40.083 --> 18:41.033
Mm...

18:41.066 --> 18:42.083
[Burps]

18:42.116 --> 18:43.350
Good.

18:45.433 --> 18:46.416
Ugh!

18:46.450 --> 18:51.033
Oh, good. Here
comes your sister.

18:51.066 --> 18:54.016
Look what I can do.

19:02.066 --> 19:03.466
Isn't that cute?

19:04.000 --> 19:07.166
Let me try that.

19:18.033 --> 19:19.266
That's nothing.

19:19.300 --> 19:21.216
Look at me.

19:28.383 --> 19:31.183
[Raspberries]

19:37.116 --> 19:39.333
[Screaming]

19:45.333 --> 19:49.233
It is nice in nature, calming.

19:49.266 --> 19:51.266
Everything
is so beautiful

19:51.300 --> 19:52.366
in the countryside--

19:52.400 --> 19:54.383
the trees,
the mountains,

19:54.416 --> 19:57.116
the little
bunny rabbit...

19:57.150 --> 19:59.083
[Flies buzzing]

19:59.116 --> 20:00.433
Unless you look
too close,

20:00.466 --> 20:04.183
and then things get
a little ugly.

20:04.216 --> 20:05.183
Hmm...

20:05.216 --> 20:07.450
[Thunder]

20:07.483 --> 20:09.083
I wonder.

20:09.116 --> 20:11.100
If everything else
is ugly,

20:11.133 --> 20:13.016
what do I look like?

20:13.050 --> 20:15.066
Dexter, voice-over:
I must look

20:15.100 --> 20:17.100
my reflection
in the face.

20:17.133 --> 20:21.016
Oh, no. Raindrops
distorting my image.

20:21.050 --> 20:23.066
I must see me clearly,

20:23.100 --> 20:27.266
so I can ban it with reason.

20:40.150 --> 20:42.450
[Raspberries]

20:51.200 --> 20:53.166
Aah!

20:53.200 --> 20:54.350
[Door slams]

20:54.383 --> 20:56.033
Now, what's
gotten

20:56.066 --> 20:57.183
into Dexter?

20:57.216 --> 20:59.100
Beats me.

21:04.466 --> 21:08.300
Curses! Must
find a mirror.

21:08.333 --> 21:12.166
Must see how hideous I am...

21:12.200 --> 21:13.166
Not?

21:13.200 --> 21:15.166
I am not hideous.

21:15.200 --> 21:17.400
Even with my height and vision,

21:17.433 --> 21:19.200
I, Dexter--boy genius,

21:19.233 --> 21:22.083
am still a vision of loveliness.

21:22.116 --> 21:23.333
Ha ha ha!

21:23.366 --> 21:27.000
All is right with the world.

21:29.216 --> 21:31.450
Enter at your own peril,
past the bolted door,

21:31.483 --> 21:34.433
where impossible things
may happen...

21:35.483 --> 21:37.166
That the world's

21:37.200 --> 21:38.300
never seen before.
