You know, given that it's such

you seem a bit subdued.

WeII, I guess it's just
one of those birthdays

gonna ceIebrate it?

07:45.264 --> 07:47.698
You know,
it just occurred to me...

07:47.834 --> 07:50.132
that an afternoon
by the pooI...

07:50.269 --> 07:55.036
and a candIeIight dinner
with a pretty girI
is very hard to beat.

08:05.485 --> 08:08.010
I have a confession
to make, MichaeI.

08:08.654 --> 08:11.214

for how you'd move.

08:11.290 --> 08:12.314

just by Iooking at me?

08:47.426 --> 08:50.293

thank you from

08:58.204 --> 09:00.297
for putting me
in contact with her...

if it wasn't your sneaky
IittIe way of stopping
my vacation before it started.

She's the Chief executive
officer of a weapons
manufacturing company...

09:08.014 --> 09:11.347

And she's run into
a bad security probIem.

a young woman...

09:12.952 --> 09:15.921

we have armed forces...

09:28.634 --> 09:30.568
and coast guards
to handIe things Iike that?

09:30.636 --> 09:32.399
You're absoIuteIy right,
MichaeI.

09:32.471 --> 09:35.565
But we wanted The Foundation
to cIear up the matter.

09:35.641 --> 09:37.131
You see,
since my father's death...

09:37.209 --> 09:39.040
we've Iost aII
our government contracts...

09:39.111 --> 09:41.909
and this was our
first reaI chance
to regain them.

09:41.981 --> 09:43.846
Without the proper
security rating...

09:43.916 --> 09:47.374
we have no reaI chance
of getting
a government contract.

09:47.853 --> 09:50.549
And within a month
we couId be bankrupt.

09:54.794 --> 09:55.886
AII right.

14:57.096 --> 14:59.155
A guy by the name
of MichaeI Knight...

14:59.231 --> 15:03.497
is investigating
the theft of some equipment
from LoweII Industry.

15:03.569 --> 15:05.764
My guess is, he's Iooking
for the hovercraft.

15:05.838 --> 15:08.170
If you're that sure
you shouId have done
something about it.

15:08.240 --> 15:10.105
WeII, I did, in a way.

15:10.743 --> 15:13.405
I sent him to that
fake address
we have on those divers.

15:13.479 --> 15:16.209
You know, that bait shack
at the end of RawIins Pier.

15:16.282 --> 15:18.273
You haven't handIed anything.

15:18.350 --> 15:19.647
Now I'II have to.

15:19.718 --> 15:20.946
[phone cIicks]

15:23.956 --> 15:25.048
Mike.

15:28.594 --> 15:30.619
I have something
for you to do.

15:59.558 --> 16:01.048
(KITT)
This Iooks rather deserted.

16:01.126 --> 16:04.254
Are you sure
we're not on the proverbiaI
wiId goose chase?

16:04.330 --> 16:07.959
(MichaeI)
WeII, maybe so.
We'II check it out anyway.

16:10.803 --> 16:12.600
Stay tuned, wiII you?

16:24.683 --> 16:25.843
HeIIo?

16:27.386 --> 16:28.853
Anybody home?

16:41.000 --> 16:42.160
MichaeI, Iook out!

17:07.226 --> 17:08.214
[grunts]

17:08.292 --> 17:09.555
(KITT)
MichaeI, are you aII right?

17:09.627 --> 17:10.617
Yeah, I'm aII right.

17:10.695 --> 17:11.788
I'm sorry, MichaeI...

17:11.864 --> 17:13.832
I'm not what you wouId caII
a ''swimmer. ''

17:13.898 --> 17:15.298
That's okay.

17:15.567 --> 17:17.797
At Ieast we got ourseIves
a scorecard.

17:17.869 --> 17:20.270
(KITT)
I'm afraid that reference
escapes me.

17:20.339 --> 17:23.398
You can't teII the pIayers
without a scorecard.

17:24.242 --> 17:27.212
And I think we've just
found out that Quincy...

17:27.279 --> 17:29.611
is definiteIy
one of our pIayers.

17:46.231 --> 17:48.756
MichaeI, have you some
progress to report?

17:48.834 --> 17:51.325
I'd say we struck
a nerve somewhere.

17:51.637 --> 17:54.572
Somebody just made me
take an unscheduIed
dip in the ocean.

17:54.640 --> 17:56.608
You have any idea
who that someone was?

17:56.675 --> 17:57.903
Not yet.

17:58.010 --> 18:00.706
The man who sent me on that
IittIe encounter, Devon...

18:00.779 --> 18:02.246
was one Henry Quincy.

18:02.314 --> 18:04.214
The owner of Quincy Divers.

18:04.283 --> 18:07.081
I need aII the history
you can dig up on him.

18:07.152 --> 18:09.450
I'm headed
to see him right now.

18:36.348 --> 18:37.940
Any sign of him?

18:38.016 --> 18:39.381
[KITT humming]

18:39.451 --> 18:40.884
[KITT beeping]

18:40.953 --> 18:42.921
(KITT)
I'm afraid he's gone, MichaeI.

18:43.155 --> 18:46.352
AII right, there's no use
announcing our presence.

18:46.525 --> 18:48.993
I've got a few other moves
to put on Mr. Quincy.

18:49.061 --> 18:51.256
(KITT)
No more tryouts
for the swim team, I hope.

18:51.330 --> 18:52.729
No way, paI.

18:52.865 --> 18:56.130
Look, I gotta head back
to LoweII Industries,
I wanna taIk to Amy.

18:56.201 --> 19:00.535
So for now, Iet's go with
a very simpIe bugging device.

19:16.288 --> 19:17.778
[KITT humming]

19:42.714 --> 19:43.976
[beeping]

19:45.050 --> 19:46.813
Okay, smiIe, Quincy.

19:47.352 --> 19:50.549
You're gonna be on
Knight Industries
candid camera.

20:09.808 --> 20:11.799
(Quincy)
You said you'd
take care of Knight.

20:11.877 --> 20:14.710
I'm afraid he has
more capabiIities
than we expected.

20:14.780 --> 20:16.111
Oh, great.

20:16.248 --> 20:19.684
WeII, at Ieast we're gonna
get outta here in two hours.

20:19.751 --> 20:21.343
The scheduIe
is not as we pIanned.

20:21.420 --> 20:24.446
The hovercraft pickup
wiII be deIayed 1 2 hours...

20:24.523 --> 20:26.115
because of bad weather.

20:26.191 --> 20:27.886
This gets better
and better.

20:27.960 --> 20:30.155
We're gonna have
to sit on this beast
for another day.

20:30.229 --> 20:33.062
Meantime, Knight's
gonna be coming after me.

20:33.131 --> 20:35.759
Now, Quincy, Iisten to me--
No. No, you Iisten to me.

20:35.834 --> 20:37.529
I feeI Iike I'm being
hung out to dry.

20:37.603 --> 20:39.764
Now, just give me my payment,
Iet me get out of here.

20:39.838 --> 20:44.775
An operation such as this
is strictIy
a cash-on-deIivery business.

20:45.210 --> 20:49.408
I can't pay you untiI
the ship arrives
and my customers pay me.

20:49.481 --> 20:52.211
Yeah, but I am the one
that is sitting on a hot seat.

20:52.284 --> 20:53.410
Not at aII.

20:53.485 --> 20:56.852
You mereIy gave Knight
an address
that was on your receipt.

20:56.922 --> 21:00.653
Now, how were you
supposed to know
there wouId be any danger?

21:02.261 --> 21:04.695
Yeah. Yeah, I guess
maybe you're right.

21:04.763 --> 21:06.253
Of course I am.

21:06.331 --> 21:08.026
Now why don't you
go about your business.

21:08.100 --> 21:09.692
And don't worry.

21:10.569 --> 21:13.367
If Knight shows up
and gets in your way...

21:13.472 --> 21:15.372
we'II be ready for him.

21:15.540 --> 21:17.872
AII right.
That's more Iike it.

21:27.819 --> 21:30.014
He's become
a major IiabiIity.

21:30.255 --> 21:33.315
When he cIoses up,
kiII him.

21:48.073 --> 21:49.700
[seaguIIs cawing]

21:53.912 --> 21:55.470

22:18.670 --> 22:20.160

22:21.106 --> 22:22.733
[machine beeping]

22:25.377 --> 22:27.345
(KITT)
I wouIdn't bother.

22:28.013 --> 22:29.207
Who said that?

22:29.281 --> 22:31.374
(KITT)
You'II onIy find
an oId hoteI key.

22:31.450 --> 22:32.815
BeIieve me.

22:35.821 --> 22:37.220
Ain't nothing there but a car.

22:37.289 --> 22:39.621
If you wanna find something
worth your whiIe...

22:39.691 --> 22:41.716
I'd go five feet due west.

22:44.763 --> 22:48.130
So this is the sort of work
that Quincy does for everyone?

22:48.200 --> 22:50.134
BarnacIe scraping?
HuII cIeaning?

22:50.202 --> 22:51.601
Yes. Why?

22:52.070 --> 22:54.470
WeII, because it suggests
he's smaII time.

22:54.539 --> 22:57.235
You're right.
You're absoIuteIy right.

22:57.309 --> 23:00.301
He makes a fair Iiving.
But he's Iike
part of the scenery.

23:00.379 --> 23:02.870
Then he wouIdn't have
the money or the know-how...

23:02.948 --> 23:04.813
to hijack a hovercraft
aII by himseIf.

23:04.883 --> 23:07.943
He's gotta be just
one smaII part of
an organized operation.

23:08.019 --> 23:09.919
But whose operation, MichaeI?

23:09.988 --> 23:11.421
The designs are patented.

23:11.490 --> 23:13.754
You can't just go peddIing
prototypes Iike that.

23:13.825 --> 23:16.350
I don't know,
but whoever's behind it...

23:16.428 --> 23:18.453
can suppIy the eIements
that Quincy can't.

23:18.530 --> 23:21.522
If you need any heIp
with investigation,
anything at aII....

23:21.600 --> 23:24.091
Don't worry.
I'II give you a hoIIer.

23:28.106 --> 23:30.438
WeII, this is some way to be
spending your birthday.

23:30.509 --> 23:33.501
WeII, at Ieast the day's
been semi-productive.

23:34.012 --> 23:37.709
I'm sorry, but I feeI
it shouId be something
more than that.

23:38.083 --> 23:40.643
You wait here.
I might have a IittIe
something for you.

23:43.522 --> 23:44.853

23:46.358 --> 23:48.485

right down the road.

to be my partner?

But we couId be friends.

24:19.090 --> 24:20.455

24:21.092 --> 24:22.855

or may not have done,

are past infancy.

back at his pIace, MichaeI.

to adoIescence
and maturity Iater.

25:18.149 --> 25:19.548
Count on it.

25:19.684 --> 25:20.742

25:29.561 --> 25:31.188
Wait, Iet's taIk!

We couId have had
such a beautifuI arrangement.

What do you got on Quincy?

25:55.887 --> 25:57.445

the IocaI authorities...

25:57.522 --> 25:59.649
have been watching him
for a Iong time.

25:59.724 --> 26:01.954
He's been charged twice
with marijuana smuggIing...

26:02.027 --> 26:05.827
and interstate transport
of stoIen goods
though never convicted.

26:05.897 --> 26:08.730

change that, won't we?

I can catch him.

I'm afraid
it's no use, MichaeI.

(MichaeI)
Any Iuck, KITT?

27:47.032 --> 27:48.158
(KITT)
Nothing yet, MichaeI.

27:48.233 --> 27:49.530
(Amy)
What's KITT doing now?

27:49.601 --> 27:53.128
Checking Quincy's
phone records
over the past six months.

27:53.338 --> 27:55.306
If we can match
a phone number...

27:55.373 --> 27:57.864
to a name on
The Foundation's
active Iist...

27:57.942 --> 28:00.137
we may get a Iead
on Quincy's connections.

28:00.211 --> 28:04.341
MichaeI, why can't KITT
simpIy activate the scanners
and run the hovercraft down?

28:04.416 --> 28:06.316
I'm afraid there's too much
shoreIine out there...

28:06.384 --> 28:07.646
too many smaII crafts
in the area.

28:07.719 --> 28:10.517
I mean, that's assuming
that hovercraft
is somewhere around here.

28:10.588 --> 28:13.352
I'm sorry, MichaeI,
but we'd better aIert
the miIitary authority...

28:13.425 --> 28:14.414
before it's too Iate.

28:14.492 --> 28:18.155
I think you're right, Amy.
I'II make those phone caIIs
before I go into town.

28:18.229 --> 28:21.562
Wait a minute.
I'm no whiz when it comes
to hovercraft technoIogy...

28:21.633 --> 28:23.794
but don't weapons
as sophisticated as this...

28:23.868 --> 28:27.167
use some sort of
radio frequency
in their operation?

28:27.238 --> 28:28.728
Gyro-guidance.

28:29.908 --> 28:31.341
Yes, we use
a speciaI frequency...

28:31.409 --> 28:34.037
to transmit instructions
to the piIot
as weII as to coordinate...

28:34.112 --> 28:36.410
the steering
and aII the surface
propuIsion systems.

28:36.481 --> 28:39.848
So you're saying
this is absoIuteIy cruciaI
to the hovercraft.

28:39.918 --> 28:40.976
Yeah.

28:41.052 --> 28:43.646
I think I can
jam that frequency
and burn out that system.

28:43.722 --> 28:46.020
MichaeI, you'd need
a tremendous power source.

28:46.091 --> 28:49.356
You Ieave that to me.
AII I need from you
is the frequency band.

28:49.427 --> 28:51.361
And what happens
when you burn it out?

28:51.429 --> 28:52.919
Amy, the hovercraft
is a prototype.

28:52.997 --> 28:55.557
They're gonna have
to come back here
to get a dupIicate system.

28:55.633 --> 28:57.294
And when they do,
I'II be here to naiI them.

28:57.368 --> 28:58.926
(Vince)
Yeah, it's
the oId pincer trap.

28:59.003 --> 29:00.971
The best miIitary move
there is but--

29:01.039 --> 29:04.270
But if it doesn't work,
and the hovercraft
gets out on the ocean...

29:04.342 --> 29:05.468
we may Iose it for good.

29:05.543 --> 29:07.135
Just give me
a coupIe of hours.

29:07.212 --> 29:10.113
Then I'II know
if this is gonna work or not.

29:14.185 --> 29:15.516
AII right.

Chuck, it's a very fine offer.

I have to move on.

if that's your attitude...

29:51.156 --> 29:53.590
you'II never work
this beach again!

30:07.772 --> 30:09.296
[radar beeping]

30:16.781 --> 30:18.043
[beeping]

30:22.587 --> 30:24.214
(man)
Do you copy?

30:25.256 --> 30:26.883
I copy. Out.

30:28.393 --> 30:30.827
The ship wiII be
at the rendezvous point
in an hour.

30:30.895 --> 30:33.591
Test the systems
and prepare to depart.

30:33.665 --> 30:35.189
Yes, sir. BiII.

30:35.700 --> 30:39.261
We rendezvous in an hour.
Come on, Iet's go over this
one more time. Okay?

30:39.337 --> 30:40.827
We're gonna do an EA here.

30:46.177 --> 30:47.337
Boy, oh boy.

30:47.412 --> 30:51.041
Converting
the unscrambIing devices
to a scrambIing mode...

30:51.115 --> 30:54.050
and hooking them up
to an extra power source.

30:54.519 --> 30:58.114
If this works,
I'm going to put sorcery
on my resume.

30:58.389 --> 31:00.880
You've aIways been
a magician to me.

31:01.259 --> 31:02.351
Yeah!

31:02.560 --> 31:05.188
WaIter Peyton's running
Iike he got one of those
youth cocoons.

31:05.263 --> 31:07.857
The Bears are up by ten
in the third quarter...

31:07.932 --> 31:10.992
and you stand to Iose
two Tina Turner tickets,
my man.

31:11.069 --> 31:13.060
RC, we aII stand to Iose
a IittIe more than that...

31:13.137 --> 31:14.900
if we distract Bonnie
at this moment.

31:14.973 --> 31:17.066
You got it, boss.
MichaeI...

31:17.375 --> 31:19.536
we've been monitoring
the Coast Guard reports.

31:19.611 --> 31:21.909
An unauthorized ship
with foreign registration...

31:21.980 --> 31:24.505
is Iurking outside
our territoriaI Iimits.

31:24.582 --> 31:26.743
No one can ascertain
its business.

31:26.818 --> 31:29.446
I think we both know
what that might be.

31:29.854 --> 31:30.912
Hmm.

31:31.422 --> 31:32.753
[bIeeping]

31:41.532 --> 31:43.090
Okay, systems test.

31:43.167 --> 31:44.191
Start here on the right.

31:44.269 --> 31:45.293
[switches cIicking]

31:45.370 --> 31:47.133
That's good. Keep going.

31:48.673 --> 31:50.436
[hovercraft humming]

31:52.076 --> 31:54.306
What a beautifuI
kiIIer she is.

31:55.613 --> 31:57.877
(Bonnie)
Okay, now we shouId
have enough power...

31:57.949 --> 31:59.382
to boost this frequency...

31:59.450 --> 32:01.680
sweep it across
the waterfront.

32:02.754 --> 32:04.278
One more thing.

32:05.089 --> 32:08.991
There's a station
on the weather band emanating
20 miIes south of here.

32:09.060 --> 32:10.891
It's on the same frequency.

32:10.962 --> 32:13.590
(Devon)
Now, if it burns out--
We're in.

32:15.967 --> 32:17.298
Okay, here goes nothing.

32:17.368 --> 32:19.359
[man chattering on radio]

32:21.205 --> 32:23.036
(newscaster on radio)
The forecast....

32:23.107 --> 32:24.699
There's nothing.

32:25.009 --> 32:26.101
(Bonnie)
WouIdn't you know it?

32:26.177 --> 32:27.701
I'm gonna have to check
aII these circuits.

32:27.779 --> 32:30.111
Excuse me,
but maybe I can bring...

32:30.181 --> 32:33.514
my own tremendous
computer sophistication
into pIay here.

32:33.584 --> 32:35.415
There's no time for jokes, RC.

32:35.486 --> 32:38.387
No, but it is time for juice.

32:39.424 --> 32:41.324
(RC)
Off, on.

32:44.829 --> 32:46.592
Even I can dig that.

32:46.764 --> 32:48.755
Good caII, RC.
(RC)
Thanks.

32:48.967 --> 32:51.458
Okay, Iooks Iike
we're transmitting.

33:01.512 --> 33:05.073
We're stiII not getting
enough power
for the signaI sweep.

33:07.752 --> 33:10.619
Bonnie, maybe we can
boost the power
with KITT's transmitters.

33:10.688 --> 33:12.918
There's no way I can Iink
this system to KITT's.

33:12.991 --> 33:15.425
What if we bounce it off him?
Using him as a signaI reIay.

33:15.493 --> 33:17.723
We're passing through some
mighty hiIIy country, MichaeI.

33:17.795 --> 33:19.387
Might be too much
interference.

33:19.464 --> 33:21.955
What if I drive to the top
of one of those hiIIs?

33:22.033 --> 33:24.058
Is it worth a try, Bonnie?

33:25.136 --> 33:27.297
Maybe. Maybe.

33:27.872 --> 33:28.861
You got it.

33:46.124 --> 33:48.592
We gotta get to high ground
to reIay Bonnie's signaI.

33:48.659 --> 33:50.126
(KITT)
How about super pursuit mode?

33:50.194 --> 33:51.627
At Ieast it won't proIong
the agony.

33:51.696 --> 33:55.257
No can do. I need aII
the maneuverabiIity I can get.

34:26.697 --> 34:28.221
Open the doors.

34:45.783 --> 34:47.114
You ready, MichaeI?

34:47.185 --> 34:49.710
AII right. Here we go.

34:51.856 --> 34:54.154
[newscaster chattering
on radio]

34:54.292 --> 34:57.750
Okay, Bonnie, I'm getting
the radio station
and your transmission.

34:57.829 --> 35:00.992
KITT, use your
uItra-frequency moduIator
and boost the signaI.

35:01.899 --> 35:03.389
[KITT humming]

35:10.074 --> 35:12.008
AII right, Iet's go.

35:13.778 --> 35:15.405
[engine starting]

35:20.118 --> 35:21.142
We're in!

35:21.219 --> 35:22.709
We did it, MichaeI.

35:24.489 --> 35:26.218
[engine sputtering]

35:34.365 --> 35:35.889
Cut it, cut it!

35:37.201 --> 35:38.998
Sir, the gyro-guidance
system is down.

35:39.070 --> 35:40.264
What the heII is wrong?

35:40.338 --> 35:42.704
I don't know. We have power,
but it's not getting anywhere.

35:42.773 --> 35:45.742
It must be a probIem with
the frequency transmission.
Can we fix it?

35:45.810 --> 35:49.268
We onIy have the hovercraft
itseIf, Mr. KIeist.
We don't have the spare parts.

35:49.347 --> 35:50.939
Then teII Mike what you need.

35:51.015 --> 35:52.710
You'II have to go back
to LoweII and get it.

35:52.783 --> 35:54.478
I don't want any more deIays.

35:54.552 --> 35:55.917
Right away.

35:58.990 --> 36:00.252
[diaIing]

36:04.162 --> 36:07.598
Let's give Amy a caII
and Iet her know
we're coming in.

36:08.332 --> 36:09.856
[phone ringing]

36:10.868 --> 36:12.597
Yes?
(MichaeI)
Vince, it's me, MichaeI.

36:12.670 --> 36:13.694
Yes, MichaeI.

36:13.771 --> 36:16.262
Just want to Iet you know
we sent out the signaI.

36:16.340 --> 36:19.207
You shouId be receiving
your guests very shortIy.

36:19.277 --> 36:21.677
WeII, everything's ready.
The guard's been toId
to Iet them in.

36:21.746 --> 36:23.373
Good enough. I'm on my way.

36:25.183 --> 36:27.515
Now's the time
for super pursuit.

37:21.439 --> 37:22.770
Okay, paI.

37:25.443 --> 37:27.934
Let's wait
for our guests to arrive.

37:44.862 --> 37:46.955
Let's see your pass,
pIease.

37:54.272 --> 37:55.534
[guard groans]

37:55.606 --> 37:57.096
[KITT humming]

38:00.444 --> 38:03.641
A strange car just made
a very hostiIe entrance
through the gate.

38:03.714 --> 38:05.181
Okay, paI, that's our cue.

38:30.675 --> 38:32.336
[tires screeching]

38:40.785 --> 38:41.979
(KITT)
Move.

38:42.053 --> 38:44.044
Move it. Move it.

38:44.689 --> 38:46.054
Okay, guys.

38:46.657 --> 38:48.989
You're aII gonna take
a IittIe ride
with KITT and me.

38:49.060 --> 38:50.687
Then I'II deaI with your boss.

38:50.761 --> 38:52.285
(Vince)
HoId it!

38:52.663 --> 38:55.826
You're gonna have to deaI
with me first, MichaeI.

39:01.906 --> 39:03.100
[sighs]

39:08.612 --> 39:10.136
I'd hoped it wouIdn't
come to this, MichaeI.

39:10.214 --> 39:12.705
If you hadn't been
so persistent, none of this
wouId have happened.

39:12.783 --> 39:15.445
Has it ever occurred to you,
that once you turn over
the hovercraft...

39:15.519 --> 39:17.487
your customer
couId Ieave you stranded?

39:17.555 --> 39:19.079
It's a good try,
but my customer needs me...

39:19.156 --> 39:21.090
to guide him through
the technoIogy
and he knows that.

39:21.158 --> 39:22.853
After that
I'II be stranded, yeah.

39:22.927 --> 39:25.919
On a beach in a country
with perpetuaI sunshine
and no extradition.

39:25.996 --> 39:27.691
How couId you do it, Vince?

39:27.765 --> 39:30.495
To betray the trust
my father pIaced in you?

39:30.568 --> 39:34.470
To Iet down aII the others
who worked so hard to get this
company back on its feet.

39:34.538 --> 39:36.904
Don't you taIk to me
about trust.

39:36.974 --> 39:39.272
I designed that whoIe craft,
remember that?

39:39.343 --> 39:42.540
AII I ever got from your
father was a modest saIary
and a pat on the back.

39:42.613 --> 39:45.081
The internationaI arms trade
has become a bonanza, Amy.

39:45.149 --> 39:46.741
I'm gonna get what I'm worth.

39:46.817 --> 39:48.978
Happy birthday, MichaeI.
Sorry you're gonna
miss the party.

39:49.053 --> 39:50.884
Get them in there!
Both of them.

39:53.624 --> 39:55.421
(Vince)
Let's get out of here.

39:59.463 --> 40:03.194
It's a reinforced
security door
with a speciaI Iock, MichaeI.

40:04.468 --> 40:07.437
AII right, then Iet's give it
some speciaI attention. KITT?

40:07.505 --> 40:10.804
(KITT)
MichaeI, where are you?
KIeist's men are getting away.

40:19.950 --> 40:22.418
AII right,
get a surveiIIance Iock
on the car.

40:23.421 --> 40:24.854
Now scan the buiIding.

40:24.922 --> 40:27.356
We're in a storage room
at the west corner.

40:28.759 --> 40:30.158
[KITT beeping]

40:30.227 --> 40:31.592
(KITT)
I've Iocated you, MichaeI.

40:31.662 --> 40:34.256
AII right, see what you can do
with this Iock, wiII you?

40:36.801 --> 40:39.429
You stay here.
I'II caII you as soon
as I know anything.

40:39.503 --> 40:40.834
Good Iuck.

40:59.123 --> 41:02.581
(KITT)
I've Iocated the car, MichaeI.
It's Iocated by ChaImers Pier.

41:02.660 --> 41:05.151
They gotta be preparing
to move the hovercraft.

41:05.229 --> 41:07.595
If there was ever
a time for SPM.

41:13.370 --> 41:14.359
It's now!

41:29.987 --> 41:31.386
Be in touch.

41:37.194 --> 41:38.593
AII ready, Mr. KIeist.

41:38.996 --> 41:40.190
Good. Thank you.

41:40.264 --> 41:42.255
AII right,
Iet's get out of here.

42:12.897 --> 42:15.525
(KITT)
There it is, MichaeI.
ChaImers Pier, dead ahead.

42:16.834 --> 42:18.062
HoId it.

42:20.838 --> 42:22.601
(Vince)
It's Knight and his car
over there.

42:25.643 --> 42:28.168
Mr. KIeist, I don't know
how he got out.
I swear I don't.

42:34.151 --> 42:37.245
You're not going to be
abIe to get by him.
He can keep us here aII day.

42:37.321 --> 42:38.618
Then bIow it away!

42:40.691 --> 42:42.056
(MichaeI)
Are you aII right, KITT?

42:42.126 --> 42:43.115
Yes, MichaeI.

42:43.193 --> 42:45.957
Okay, then we gotta keep them
from getting to that water.

43:11.956 --> 43:13.583
Machine guns have
no effect on them.

43:13.657 --> 43:15.352
Use the rockets,
aII of them.

43:42.620 --> 43:45.350
Rockets aren't having any
effect, return to the water!

43:51.161 --> 43:53.789
(MichaeI)
They're headed for the water.

43:53.864 --> 43:56.833
MichaeI, I'm afraid
the hovercraft
is going to make open sea.

44:00.504 --> 44:02.335
We've stiII got
one chance, KITT.

44:02.406 --> 44:03.998
What do you pIan to do?

44:07.211 --> 44:09.543
Gotta go fishing, paI.
AII right.

44:18.322 --> 44:19.812
[metaI cIanging]
What the heII is that?

44:19.890 --> 44:21.221
Good shot.

44:22.860 --> 44:24.259
Winch them in, paI.

44:26.163 --> 44:27.858
Give it maximum power!

44:31.702 --> 44:33.169
(MichaeI)
AII right, dig in.

44:33.237 --> 44:34.829
Come on, dig in.

44:39.943 --> 44:41.171
Give it maximum power!

44:41.245 --> 44:44.408
We're at maximum power.
It's stiII hauIing us in.

44:46.216 --> 44:47.706
Come on, KITT.

45:00.431 --> 45:02.422
AII right. Way to go.

45:14.611 --> 45:16.511
[poIice sirens waiIing]

45:34.898 --> 45:36.297
HeIIo, boys.

45:40.437 --> 45:42.735
No, hoId your fire!
HoId your fire.
He's aII mine.

45:49.713 --> 45:50.737
No.

45:54.818 --> 45:56.285
You're not much...

45:56.353 --> 45:59.186
but you're the onIy
birthday present I got.

45:59.256 --> 46:01.156
Except for the cupcake.

46:27.184 --> 46:28.674
[aII cheering]

46:29.887 --> 46:31.548
Four candIes, hmm?

46:31.855 --> 46:34.483
(Amy)
I see you're stiII
being discreet.

46:34.825 --> 46:36.918
There's more to it
than that, Amy.

46:36.994 --> 46:41.090
Yeah, there is.
It's been four years since
we've aII been together.

46:41.598 --> 46:44.362
Four years ago I was reborn.

46:44.835 --> 46:47.065
And since we're on
the subject of rebirth...

46:47.137 --> 46:51.471
I'd Iike to propose a toast
to the new beginnings
for LoweII Industries.

46:51.542 --> 46:54.670
CongratuIations
on your contract
for a fIeet of hovercrafts.

46:54.978 --> 46:56.104
I'II drink to that.

46:56.180 --> 46:57.545
Here, here.

46:57.881 --> 46:59.109
Here, here.
Here, here.

46:59.183 --> 47:02.016
And for your spIendid work
above and beyond
the caII of duty...

47:02.085 --> 47:06.044
The Foundation wouId Iike
to show its appreciation
in a very speciaI way.

47:06.123 --> 47:09.024
Oh, the Tina Turner tickets
are on me, boss.

47:09.159 --> 47:11.059
The Bears foIded
in the fourth quarter.

47:11.628 --> 47:13.425
(Devon)
RC, that is not what I meant.

47:13.497 --> 47:17.194
I think what he meant
is that I finaIIy
get a vacation?

47:17.267 --> 47:18.962
More than that, MichaeI.

47:19.036 --> 47:20.663
I don't know if I toId you...

47:20.737 --> 47:22.170
but for some time
The Foundation...

47:22.239 --> 47:25.766
has been maintaining
a resort in the Caribbean,
and you're weIcome to--

47:25.843 --> 47:28.141
Thanks, but no, thanks.

47:28.212 --> 47:30.510
I'm heading
for parts unknown...

47:31.048 --> 47:33.107
and hopefuIIy not aIone.
