06:39.691 --> 06:42.361
Good morning.

06:52.079 --> 06:54.039
Good morning, sleepyhead.

07:36.874 --> 07:39.126
Marmalade's fur is wild, huh?

07:39.209 --> 07:41.461
Time for a haircut.

07:41.545 --> 07:43.463
She hates getting it cut.

07:43.547 --> 07:46.258
Of course, but she likes
getting a treat after.

08:34.973 --> 08:36.808
Can't we skip it today, mom?

08:36.892 --> 08:39.519
I'm going to be late.

08:39.603 --> 08:41.480
Don't worry,
there's enough time.

09:26.858 --> 09:30.153
Good morning, Argentina...

09:38.161 --> 09:39.913
We should do the shearing
this weekend.

09:39.997 --> 09:42.833
We'll save our trip to
the movies for some other time.

09:42.916 --> 09:44.501
Are you kidding?

09:44.584 --> 09:47.504
I told you we should have
done it last weekend.

09:47.587 --> 09:50.173
Is something bothering you?

09:50.257 --> 09:51.300
Did something happen?

09:51.383 --> 09:55.721
You're always putting things off
to the last minute.

10:23.749 --> 10:25.292
I love you.

10:25.375 --> 10:27.002
Love you too.

10:59.785 --> 11:01.203
Hi Toni.

11:01.286 --> 11:03.538
Hi Matias, how are you?

11:04.039 --> 11:06.124
What are you drawing?

11:06.208 --> 11:07.626
It's nothing. Just stupid stuff.

11:07.709 --> 11:10.253
Well, if it's stupid, why do you
spend so much time doing it?

11:10.337 --> 11:11.380
Always drawing.

11:11.463 --> 11:12.631
Leave her alone.

11:12.714 --> 11:14.591
She doesn't want to show you.

11:14.674 --> 11:16.635
Whatever.

11:17.427 --> 11:19.721
Don't pay attention to him.

11:19.805 --> 11:21.431
Hey.

11:21.515 --> 11:23.975
Can I ask you something?

11:24.059 --> 11:25.435
Yes.

11:42.869 --> 11:44.079
All of it.

11:44.955 --> 11:46.790
Try it.

11:51.169 --> 11:52.379
Needs more salt.

11:52.462 --> 11:53.797
Really?

11:56.007 --> 11:59.719
Want to do your homework
in here?

11:59.803 --> 12:02.848
I have a paper due tomorrow

12:02.931 --> 12:04.975
so I'm gonna stay in my room.

12:05.058 --> 12:06.768
Okay. Good luck, then.

12:06.852 --> 12:09.104
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

12:52.647 --> 12:54.316
Damn!

12:54.399 --> 12:57.903
I know you said it was far away
but this is way out here...

12:57.986 --> 13:00.739
Does your mom know
you're out this late, Toni?

13:00.822 --> 13:02.199
Shut up, asshole.

13:02.282 --> 13:03.366
Pick you up in an hour,

13:03.450 --> 13:05.410
loverboy.

13:05.494 --> 13:07.871
I wasn't sure you'd come.

13:07.954 --> 13:09.748
So this is where you live.

13:09.831 --> 13:11.166
Cool.

13:14.544 --> 13:17.088
Stop. This is close enough.

13:19.466 --> 13:21.218
Look at this place.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.720
I know it's weird.

13:23.803 --> 13:25.597
But my family has been here
for like hundreds of years.

13:25.680 --> 13:26.973
My mom refuses to leave.

13:27.057 --> 13:29.267
Okay, you saw it.

13:31.186 --> 13:32.729
Whoa. What's this?

13:32.812 --> 13:35.482
Oh. It's nothing. Matias--

13:44.908 --> 13:47.077
Holy shit.

13:49.120 --> 13:51.122
Who has a church
in their backyard?

13:53.166 --> 13:54.209
Can you stop that, please?

13:54.292 --> 13:55.961
Please, let me see.

13:56.044 --> 13:58.296
Don't you want to sit with me?

13:59.381 --> 14:01.841
Er...

14:01.925 --> 14:03.218
Sure.

14:17.107 --> 14:18.525
I have to tell you--

14:25.115 --> 14:26.533
Am I doing it wrong?

14:28.368 --> 14:30.078
It...

14:30.161 --> 14:32.205
was a dare.

14:33.373 --> 14:34.666
A dare?

14:35.166 --> 14:37.586
The guys said they'd give me
four thousand pesos

14:37.669 --> 14:39.754
if I went inside.

14:39.838 --> 14:43.383
You know: the haunted house.

14:47.095 --> 14:49.097
I'm sorry.

14:51.683 --> 14:53.727
What?

14:53.810 --> 14:57.272
Everyone has heard the stories
about your grandpa.

14:57.355 --> 15:01.067
Is this where
he did his cult stuff?

15:03.987 --> 15:07.490
I thought you liked me...

15:10.785 --> 15:12.621
Hey...

15:14.205 --> 15:15.415
we can split the money.

15:15.498 --> 15:17.292
What are you doing in here?!?

15:17.375 --> 15:18.835
- Nothing.
- What are you doing in here?!?

15:18.918 --> 15:19.919
Nothing!

15:20.003 --> 15:20.920
Get out!

15:21.004 --> 15:22.297
Get the fuck out of here. Now!

15:22.380 --> 15:24.299
And you! Go to your room!

15:26.217 --> 15:28.595
You're ruining my life!

26:32.049 --> 26:33.926
Where are you going?

26:38.556 --> 26:40.891
With a knapsack?

26:43.519 --> 26:46.063
Don't be mad at me anymore.

26:47.189 --> 26:48.816
Can we please do a reset?

26:54.739 --> 26:59.535
I know it's hard.
Living how we do.

27:00.536 --> 27:03.956
By ourselves,
in the middle of nowhere.

27:05.499 --> 27:07.418
Especially at your age.

27:09.045 --> 27:10.421
It's a sacrifice...

27:10.504 --> 27:12.089
I know.

27:12.173 --> 27:14.091
But... hey.

27:14.175 --> 27:16.761
God takes note.

27:16.844 --> 27:19.263
This isn't about God.

27:19.347 --> 27:21.682
It's about me having no friends.

27:21.766 --> 27:24.185
About having to live
in a stupid house

27:24.268 --> 27:27.396
and look after
a boring old chapel.

27:27.480 --> 27:29.815
That's what God wants?

27:29.899 --> 27:31.150
Why?

27:35.112 --> 27:37.031
I made a promise.

27:38.824 --> 27:41.160
As did grandpa.

27:41.243 --> 27:43.287
And his father.

27:43.371 --> 27:45.581
And so on.

27:45.664 --> 27:47.208
Many.

27:49.085 --> 27:50.044
I can't.

27:50.127 --> 27:52.797
And I don't want to...

27:52.880 --> 27:55.466
go back on that promise.

27:55.549 --> 27:57.426
A promise to do what?

27:57.510 --> 27:59.804
I didn't make a promise.

27:59.887 --> 28:02.223
I don't want to be a prisoner
to that house.

28:02.306 --> 28:04.683
When I was your age,

28:04.767 --> 28:07.144
grandpa Epi...

28:07.228 --> 28:10.356
told me something I didn't
understand until later.

28:11.107 --> 28:13.025
He told me.

28:13.109 --> 28:14.902
There is...

28:14.985 --> 28:17.530
no greater gift in life

28:17.613 --> 28:19.448
than having a purpose.

28:19.532 --> 28:22.201
Is that why he went to jail?

28:22.284 --> 28:24.495
Because he had a purpose?

28:24.578 --> 28:27.164
You didn't need to say that.

28:27.248 --> 28:29.333
Being a Calderon

28:29.417 --> 28:32.086
means you're destined
for a higher purpose.

28:32.169 --> 28:34.171
I know mom, I know.

28:34.255 --> 28:36.382
What does that even mean?

28:36.465 --> 28:37.716
When you're older you'll see.

28:37.800 --> 28:39.885
I'm fifteen.

28:39.969 --> 28:42.471
Our ancestors probably
were married by now.

28:42.555 --> 28:43.806
Tell me the truth.

28:47.560 --> 28:49.270
I'm done with the rules.

28:54.567 --> 28:58.070
Everyone in our family

29:00.698 --> 29:04.368
we are the guardians of
something very special.

29:06.245 --> 29:09.123
And you will find out
at the right moment.

29:09.206 --> 29:11.375
It's God's will.

29:12.835 --> 29:15.754
You sound crazy, you know that?

29:26.891 --> 29:28.017
Let's go.

29:28.100 --> 29:30.102
We have to go!

38:49.411 --> 38:51.538
Stay in the truck.

39:06.011 --> 39:08.221
I'm armed!

39:08.305 --> 39:10.932
Put your arms up. I'm serious.

39:12.267 --> 39:14.061
I will shoot you.

40:16.331 --> 40:18.208
Are you okay?

40:18.291 --> 40:19.584
Who is he?

40:20.836 --> 40:22.295
Yes, I'm okay.

40:22.379 --> 40:23.839
Stay there.
