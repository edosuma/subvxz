00:02.865 --> 00:05.390
<i>Previously on Battlestar Galactica.</i>

00:36.565 --> 00:39.329
Your doctor
back on Caprica was right.

00:39.635 --> 00:42.536
It's too damn late to operate,
the cancer is too far advanced.

00:42.604 --> 00:45.471
Have you ever heard of
Chamalla extract?

00:45.741 --> 00:48.869
It means that you're still acting
like you're everyone's best friend.

00:48.944 --> 00:50.673
We're not friends,
you're the CAG.

00:50.779 --> 00:52.804
The Chief wanted me
to kick your ass out of bed.

00:52.881 --> 00:56.942
But, clearly, you still need the
rest. Take your time. No rush.

00:57.452 --> 01:00.387
I need new pilots.
And I want you to train them.

01:00.622 --> 01:02.146
I can do that.

01:02.591 --> 01:04.286
They slipped through.
How's that possible?

01:04.559 --> 01:07.619
She thinks she loves him now;
that she can't live without him.

01:07.696 --> 01:11.359
Bothers you, doesn't it?
We'll get them in the end.

01:16.638 --> 01:20.233
I can assure you, the fuel
shortage is our number one priority.

01:20.309 --> 01:23.142
<i>Galactica has ships scouring
the nearby star systems...</i>

01:23.211 --> 01:25.975
and we can anticipate that
they will soon find tylium.

01:31.053 --> 01:32.384
Hamilton?

01:32.654 --> 01:34.986
Madam President,
tylium ore is extremely rare.

01:35.057 --> 01:38.185
If we don't find any, how long
before the fleet runs out of fuel?

01:39.761 --> 01:42.127
That all depends on
how well we conserve.

01:42.264 --> 01:43.856
Isn't it a
fact, Madam President...

01:43.932 --> 01:46.400
that we only have enough
for two more jumps?

01:46.535 --> 01:48.435
Yes. That is correct.

01:50.205 --> 01:53.800
Do we have a contingency plan
if we run out of tylium?

02:05.887 --> 02:07.411
We would...

02:09.891 --> 02:12.883
If that were to happen...

02:12.961 --> 02:15.259
we would use our last fuel...

02:15.897 --> 02:18.525
to jump to
the nearest planetary system.

02:18.633 --> 02:22.228
And pray we're lucky enough
to find a habitable planet.

02:27.676 --> 02:32.204
Madam President, without fuel to take
even the most basic evasive maneuvers...

02:32.280 --> 02:33.474
No...

02:38.320 --> 02:40.914
Wouldn't we be like
ducks in a Cylon shooting gallery?

02:40.989 --> 02:42.513
Yes, we would.

02:56.304 --> 02:57.862
I'm...

02:58.407 --> 02:59.840
I'm sorry.

03:01.777 --> 03:03.608
That is all for now.

03:21.997 --> 03:25.296
<i>Commencing
sweep 87 of asteroid field.</i>

03:31.907 --> 03:33.238
Any luck?

03:33.642 --> 03:36.236
How many times are
you going to ask me that, Boomer?

03:36.311 --> 03:38.643
Until you find
some tylium ore.

03:39.815 --> 03:43.080
Don't you want to be a hero
to Ensign Davis?

03:44.719 --> 03:48.246
You haven't noticed how she always
sits next to you in the mess?

03:48.457 --> 03:52.393
"How's it going,
Crash? You're so cute!"

03:53.361 --> 03:56.558
Damn it. There's so much debris in
this system, the dradis is useless.

03:56.631 --> 03:58.098
This is going to take
100 years.

03:58.166 --> 03:59.428
I heard about
how you found water...

03:59.501 --> 04:01.230
how you saved
the whole fleet...

04:12.347 --> 04:16.340
Jackpot, Boomer. That asteroid
dead ahead is a mountain of tylium.

04:18.620 --> 04:19.951
Check it!

04:21.323 --> 04:24.520
Thank the Gods!
We're heroes. Yeah.

04:24.593 --> 04:26.151
"We're heroes. "
It never fails.

04:26.228 --> 04:30.028
Great, Boomer, the second that I score, the
bus driver jumps in and takes the credit.

04:30.098 --> 04:33.363
Okay, so who's the one
that we suggest... What?

04:35.770 --> 04:37.067
Cylons.

04:41.376 --> 04:43.173
The rock's crawling with them.

04:43.345 --> 04:45.506
We are well and truly fracked.

04:45.714 --> 04:48.512
Only tylium within 12 light years
and we've got to kiss it goodbye.

04:48.583 --> 04:52.041
Yeah, along with our asses if
we don't get out of here fast.

06:08.428 --> 06:10.225
It figures the
Cylons would be sitting...

06:10.297 --> 06:12.925
on the only source of fuel
within our reach.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.161
Still staking out every
waterhole in the desert.

06:15.269 --> 06:19.763
Only this time it's a lake, with enough
tylium to last us a couple of years.

06:20.474 --> 06:22.408
This must be some
kind of conveyor belt...

06:22.476 --> 06:25.343
to get the ore from the mine here
into this cracking plant here.

06:25.579 --> 06:27.513
A refinery this
far from their home world?

06:27.581 --> 06:29.947
Why not? They need fuel
as much as we do.

06:30.250 --> 06:31.581
Now they've got it.

06:31.652 --> 06:34.086
And enough firepower
to keep it.

06:36.290 --> 06:39.259
All right. So we forget this
asteroid, find another source.

06:39.326 --> 06:42.022
You can bet your ass the Cylons
will be guarding that one, too.

06:42.095 --> 06:43.494
So, we send
the Raptors out farther.

06:43.564 --> 06:46.294
Ten, fifteen jumps, find a
source they haven't reached yet.

06:46.366 --> 06:47.856
And use up all our fuel doing it.

06:47.935 --> 06:49.869
How're we going to get
our refinery ship...

06:49.937 --> 06:51.928
We take the tylium
from the Cylons.

06:58.478 --> 07:02.141
With all respect, this is hardly
a time to attack a superior force.

07:02.215 --> 07:04.308
This is exactly the time.

07:05.152 --> 07:08.315
We know where they are.
They don't know where we are.

07:08.388 --> 07:11.152
We'll catch them
with their pants down.

07:12.326 --> 07:13.759
If we fail?

07:14.294 --> 07:15.761
End of game.

07:17.164 --> 07:18.927
So we don't fail.

07:21.268 --> 07:23.327
When the missile
gets close enough...

07:23.437 --> 07:24.995
you'll be pulling maybe 7 G's.

07:25.072 --> 07:27.973
But to catch you, the bastard's
going to have to pile on 40 to 60.

07:28.075 --> 07:31.135
Its guidance system can't
hack it, and it'll miss...

07:31.378 --> 07:33.073
most of the time.

07:33.280 --> 07:35.009
Exactly how often is
"most of the time"?

07:36.216 --> 07:39.117
It depends on your judgment,
and how well you pray.

07:39.353 --> 07:41.150
Attention on deck.

07:43.457 --> 07:45.254
As you were.

07:45.859 --> 07:47.850
Lieutenant Thrace,
can I have a word?

07:47.928 --> 07:50.294
Of course. Take five, guys.

07:51.064 --> 07:53.396
What's up?
How are they doing?

07:53.667 --> 07:57.228
Wobbly as newborn colts,
but they're getting stronger.

07:58.271 --> 07:59.738
That's good.

08:01.141 --> 08:02.870
Got a job for you.

08:03.910 --> 08:06.936
Rumor mill has it
that you're planning an op.

08:07.080 --> 08:09.571
Rumor mill's right
for a change.

08:09.983 --> 08:13.419
Capt. Adama and Col. Tigh
are working up the plan now...

08:13.553 --> 08:16.420
and I need some serious
out-of-the-box thinking.

08:16.623 --> 08:18.989
Out-of-the-box
is where I live.

08:24.498 --> 08:27.865
I've been taking Chamalla
for a medical condition.

08:30.137 --> 08:32.002
So what have you seen?

08:32.105 --> 08:35.506
It started out as dreams of
the Cylon that we had executed.

08:35.575 --> 08:38.567
But I had the dreams
before we captured him.

08:38.879 --> 08:42.474
The images were...
Prescient?

08:42.783 --> 08:44.444
Uncanny.

08:44.951 --> 08:48.546
And now I'm seeing things
while I'm awake.

08:51.692 --> 08:54.855
What kind of things?
Snakes.

08:55.028 --> 08:59.931
There were snakes crawling all over
my podium during a press conference.

09:00.333 --> 09:04.292
How many?
About a dozen.

09:10.143 --> 09:11.701
You're kidding, right?

09:11.812 --> 09:14.679
You read Pythia,
and now you're having me on.

09:14.781 --> 09:15.975
No.

09:16.616 --> 09:20.609
Who is Pythia? One of the
oracles in the sacred scrolls.

09:21.621 --> 09:24.021
3,600 years ago...

09:24.091 --> 09:28.050
Pythia wrote about the exile and
the rebirth of the human race.

09:28.228 --> 09:29.923
And the Lords
anointed a leader...

09:29.996 --> 09:33.227
to guide the caravan of the
heavens to their new homeland.

09:33.333 --> 09:35.858
And unto the leader
they gave a vision...

09:35.936 --> 09:39.099
of serpents,
numbering two and ten...

09:39.372 --> 09:41.636
as a sign of things to come.

09:42.609 --> 09:43.769
Pythia wrote that?

09:43.877 --> 09:46.744
She also wrote that the new leader
suffered a wasting disease...

09:46.813 --> 09:48.804
and would not live
to enter the new land.

09:49.015 --> 09:51.745
But you're not dying.
Are you?

09:55.722 --> 09:57.553
And that will
allow the attack force...

09:57.624 --> 09:59.148
to wipe out
these installations here.

10:00.727 --> 10:04.561
Now, if we do it right, there
will be not be any Cylon survivors.

10:05.899 --> 10:08.663
And the asteroid
will be ours.

10:11.838 --> 10:14.398
What do you think, Starbuck?

10:15.208 --> 10:19.008
It's a textbook-perfect plan,
which is why it won't work.

10:19.079 --> 10:21.047
Of course.

10:21.114 --> 10:24.174
We bow to your vast experience
in strategic planning.

10:24.251 --> 10:27.550
Refresh my memory. What year was it
that you graduated from war college?

10:27.621 --> 10:30.181
What's the matter, Colonel,
married life not all you expected?

10:30.257 --> 10:31.781
That's enough.
Both of you.

10:32.793 --> 10:35.728
We're not going to
win this one by the book.

10:35.796 --> 10:36.956
I want Starbuck in here...

10:37.030 --> 10:40.466
because she's not weighed down
by conventional thinking.

10:41.635 --> 10:45.332
All due respect, gentlemen,
we're not as crazy as she is.

10:47.440 --> 10:50.307
Okay. So what would you do
differently?

10:53.680 --> 10:55.079
To start...

10:56.016 --> 10:58.075
<i>jumping Galactica
in behind the planetoid...</i>

10:58.151 --> 11:01.143
to hide it from the Cylon base
is an obvious move.

11:01.388 --> 11:04.289
You think they'll be covering
their blind spot with recon patrols?

11:04.357 --> 11:06.382
I would, if I were them.

11:06.927 --> 11:11.261
What we need to do is make their
patrols part of our plan, you know?

11:11.765 --> 11:14.131
Make their tactics
work for us.

11:15.969 --> 11:18.164
Here's what I would do.

11:20.740 --> 11:22.298
At position code Deacon...

11:22.375 --> 11:24.673
we'll need three civilian
freighter ships to use as decoys.

11:25.979 --> 11:29.039
Which means those passengers will
have to be relocated to other ships...

11:29.115 --> 11:31.083
which are
already overcrowded.

11:31.284 --> 11:33.115
Yes, if you approve.

11:33.587 --> 11:36.249
The decoy ships will jump
into the enemy star system...

11:36.323 --> 11:38.951
at extreme radar range
from the Cylon asteroid.

11:39.092 --> 11:41.185
<i>Galactica
will jump here...</i>

11:41.328 --> 11:43.387
close enough to launch
its Vipers at the base.

11:43.463 --> 11:45.488
Soon as the decoy freighters
arrive in the system...

11:45.565 --> 11:47.624
they'll break
wireless silence.

11:47.701 --> 11:50.636
They'll be posing as a mining
fleet coming after the tylium...

11:50.704 --> 11:53.036
and pretend to be unaware
of the Cylon presence.

11:53.106 --> 11:54.903
The Cylons
will hear the messages...

11:54.975 --> 11:57.000
and send a force of Raiders
after them.

11:57.077 --> 11:59.307
This will leave the base
relatively undefended.

12:00.146 --> 12:03.547
We'll have Raptors pre-positioned
to keep an eye on the Cylons.

12:03.650 --> 12:05.811
When the Cylons move
toward the decoys...

12:05.986 --> 12:09.422
Galactica's Vipers will come in
from behind, and obliterate the base.

12:09.489 --> 12:12.947
Without the base, they'll be
unable to rearm, refuel.

12:13.159 --> 12:15.525
We'll mop them up, and then
we'll take the tylium.

12:15.595 --> 12:18.462
What happens to the crews
on the civilian decoy ships?

12:18.531 --> 12:22.763
They'll keep their FTL drives spooled up and
just jump clear the first sign of trouble.

12:22.836 --> 12:24.827
How many casualties
do we anticipate?

12:24.971 --> 12:26.529
It'll cost us.

12:32.279 --> 12:34.474
If you succeed, what's
to prevent the Cylons...

12:34.547 --> 12:36.037
from coming back
with reinforcements?

12:36.116 --> 12:37.515
Nothing.

12:38.018 --> 12:39.952
But if we get a chance
to knock out that base...

12:40.020 --> 12:41.817
it'll buy us some time.

12:42.155 --> 12:43.213
Why?

12:43.290 --> 12:45.383
If you keep running
from the schoolyard bully...

12:45.458 --> 12:48.188
he keeps on chasing you. But the
moment you turn around and stop...

12:48.261 --> 12:51.094
and you punch him really hard
in a sensitive spot...

12:51.698 --> 12:54.189
he'll think twice
about coming back again.

12:54.401 --> 12:57.461
So it's either this, or run
out of fuel and be annihilated.

12:57.537 --> 13:00.472
Sometimes you have to roll
the hard six.

13:02.075 --> 13:05.238
Well, the freighters are
yours. Good hunting, everyone.

13:05.312 --> 13:07.576
Operation starts
in 48 hours.

13:07.681 --> 13:09.478
This is our target.

13:10.417 --> 13:11.907
A Cylon base?

13:12.986 --> 13:15.216
You're the Cylon expert.

13:15.755 --> 13:18.121
We need to destroy
their military facilities.

13:18.191 --> 13:21.422
Without harming the tylium
ore under the surface.

13:21.494 --> 13:22.791
Exactly.

13:23.563 --> 13:25.997
A nuke would destroy
the Cylons.

13:26.066 --> 13:30.526
But the radiation would
render the ore inert, unusable.

13:31.838 --> 13:33.601
I see your dilemma.

13:36.309 --> 13:37.936
You're in luck, you know.

13:38.511 --> 13:40.502
Refined tylium contains
tremendous enthalpy...

13:40.580 --> 13:42.741
to the order of half a billion
megajoules per kilo.

13:42.816 --> 13:47.014
If subjected to right heat and compression,
say, from a conventional warhead...

13:47.120 --> 13:49.384
you should get a suitably
devastating explosion...

13:49.456 --> 13:51.617
without
the radioactive fallout.

13:51.725 --> 13:53.852
All we have to do
is hit the right spot.

13:53.927 --> 13:58.091
Specifically, you need to hit the staging
tanks for the refined tylium precursor.

13:58.164 --> 14:01.600
It's a lot more unstable
than the fuel itself.

14:02.235 --> 14:04.260
And where would they be?

14:08.174 --> 14:10.540
I need your advice
on this one.

14:12.278 --> 14:14.269
I'm flattered, Gaius...

14:14.948 --> 14:18.406
but I don't know the first
thing about tylium refineries.

14:18.485 --> 14:19.975
Neither do I.

14:22.589 --> 14:24.784
Come on, you must have
an inkling...

14:24.891 --> 14:27.621
where I should tell them to bomb? No.

14:28.995 --> 14:31.930
But God does.
Oh, good.

14:33.833 --> 14:37.166
I suppose God doesn't want me
to destroy the base because...

14:39.973 --> 14:42.942
he's the Cylon God. Right?

14:43.343 --> 14:45.334
God doesn't take sides.

14:47.080 --> 14:49.105
He only wants your love.

14:50.417 --> 14:53.875
Open your heart to him,
and he'll show you the way.

14:54.687 --> 14:56.746
It'd be a lot simpler
if he came out and told me.

14:56.823 --> 15:01.385
You must remember to surrender
your ego. Remain humble.

15:02.796 --> 15:04.821
If you ask me...

15:05.065 --> 15:08.899
God could do with cleaning his ears out.
Then he might hear what I have to say.

15:08.968 --> 15:11.835
Relax your neck.
Why? What are you going to do?

15:11.905 --> 15:14.499
I said relax.
All right, but please don't...

15:15.809 --> 15:18.778
Where would the
staging tanks be, Doctor?

15:34.427 --> 15:36.224
There. Right there.

15:37.964 --> 15:42.458
Hit any one of them and the place
will go up like a three-kiloton bomb.

16:04.491 --> 16:05.856
Well done.

16:06.793 --> 16:11.696
Forceful, so decisive,
delivered with such élan.

16:13.566 --> 16:15.466
He didn't speak to me.

16:17.103 --> 16:19.094
God didn't speak to me.

16:20.940 --> 16:22.771
I was totally lying.

16:23.243 --> 16:25.234
I just picked
that spot at random.

16:25.411 --> 16:28.278
He doesn't always speak
in words, Gaius.

16:32.285 --> 16:33.843
So the fate...

16:35.121 --> 16:39.023
of the entire human race
depends upon my wild guess.

16:59.244 --> 17:01.144
Attention on
deck. As you were.

17:07.586 --> 17:10.054
How's the knee, Starbuck?

17:10.155 --> 17:13.283
It'll be ready.
I'm not missing this party.

17:20.799 --> 17:22.790
Apollo's leading
the strike force.

17:22.868 --> 17:24.301
You're gonna have to
sit this one out.

17:25.370 --> 17:28.703
I'm the best pilot that
you have. Not right now.

17:30.008 --> 17:32.943
In combat,
you got to pull 6, 7 G's.

17:33.445 --> 17:35.413
Doc says your knee
won't take it.

17:35.514 --> 17:37.846
Well, then he's wrong.
Is he?

17:42.154 --> 17:44.213
A Viper thruster pedal...

17:44.423 --> 17:47.620
requires this much force...

17:50.962 --> 17:52.395
to activate.

18:00.539 --> 18:02.871
Now you're on your attack run.

18:03.608 --> 18:05.633
They launch their missiles.

18:05.811 --> 18:09.247
So you've got to
jam that pedal...

18:10.882 --> 18:12.406
near the firewall...

18:13.652 --> 18:15.950
and hold a 6 G turn...

18:20.792 --> 18:22.919
for 10 seconds,
or you die.

18:24.663 --> 18:27.723
10, 9, 8...

18:28.433 --> 18:33.166
7, 6, 5, 4.

18:44.349 --> 18:47.318
This was only 3 G's,
Starbuck. Not 6.

18:48.854 --> 18:51.084
I'm sorry.
It's a tough one.

18:52.157 --> 18:54.216
But you're staying home.

18:59.097 --> 19:01.463
Keep your
ingress low and fast.

19:01.867 --> 19:04.665
Use the terrain to stay hidden
till the last second.

19:04.970 --> 19:07.564
Make sure you give the flak
suppression unit enough time...

19:07.639 --> 19:09.903
so they can weaken defenses.

19:10.242 --> 19:13.541
You don't think I'm up
to this? Of course I do.

19:14.146 --> 19:15.704
You'll be fine.

19:22.287 --> 19:25.950
Look, you're worried that I'm not
going to pull it out of the fire...

19:26.024 --> 19:28.458
with some high-risk,
retina-detaching move...

19:28.527 --> 19:30.518
the way Starbuck would.

19:31.096 --> 19:33.064
Look, Kara, I'm sorry
you're not suiting up.

19:33.131 --> 19:36.100
Because, believe me, everyone would
feel so much better, me included...

19:36.168 --> 19:38.227
if you were riding
along with us.

19:38.437 --> 19:41.429
But this isn't an ego trip.
This is my job.

19:41.673 --> 19:44.198
And don't think for one moment
that I will not get it done.

19:44.276 --> 19:47.006
I hope so.
Because we've got one shot.

19:48.246 --> 19:50.771
Don't frack it up
by over-thinking.

20:02.227 --> 20:05.128
Nice thing about being
on the run after a nuclear war...

20:05.230 --> 20:08.893
nobody left to complain if we hide out
in their barn or raid their pantry...

20:08.967 --> 20:12.664
while you're on your way to steal
a ship, and get off the planet.

20:12.804 --> 20:14.931
It's odd, isn't it?
What?

20:15.173 --> 20:18.267
That we haven't seen a single
living human being since...

20:18.710 --> 20:20.701
since the one you shot
when you rescued me.

20:21.046 --> 20:23.640
We're still alive.
Why nobody else?

20:24.449 --> 20:27.145
Probably holed out in the
fallout shelters or something.

20:36.561 --> 20:39.394
Two ways out and a lovely
view. What could be better?

20:39.498 --> 20:42.160
A feather bed
and a silk comforter.

20:58.216 --> 20:59.615
You hungry?

21:02.020 --> 21:05.251
I don't know. What do we got?
Peanut butter...

21:10.595 --> 21:13.462
baked beans, corn...

21:17.068 --> 21:18.968
How about some chili?

21:23.642 --> 21:25.633
A simple no would do.

21:26.611 --> 21:30.206
Sharon, have you been taking
your anti-radiation meds?

21:30.982 --> 21:34.543
I think it was those cold
beans we had this afternoon.

21:37.656 --> 21:39.817
You okay now?
Yeah.

21:43.228 --> 21:45.492
How far you figure
to Delphi?

21:47.332 --> 21:50.460
Eight, maybe ten days
if we move fast.

21:52.037 --> 21:55.165
If we start early,
we can be there in no time.

22:05.016 --> 22:06.449
Can't sleep?

22:11.690 --> 22:14.250
I couldn't
either before a big op.

22:16.227 --> 22:17.717
<i>Mark II.</i>

22:19.064 --> 22:20.429
Good ship.

22:22.400 --> 22:25.096
Got me out of
a lot of tough scrapes.

22:31.376 --> 22:33.537
I've got something for you.

22:35.347 --> 22:37.781
It belonged
to your grandfather.

22:38.817 --> 22:42.218
My mom bought it for him
when he was in law school.

22:47.659 --> 22:49.923
You see the engraving on it?

22:51.563 --> 22:54.532
Yeah, I can
barely make it out, but...

22:56.935 --> 22:59.495
He was a better father
than I was.

23:05.043 --> 23:07.409
Dad used to carry that
in to court cases.

23:07.479 --> 23:11.939
Claimed he never lost,
unless he left it behind.

23:17.455 --> 23:19.446
So you're worried, too?

23:22.961 --> 23:24.360
About what?

23:24.596 --> 23:27.429
You know, sometimes it feels
like the whole ship...

23:27.565 --> 23:30.398
thinks Starbuck
would do better.

23:31.736 --> 23:32.998
I don't.

23:35.840 --> 23:37.831
How can you be so sure?

23:40.278 --> 23:42.178
Because you're my son.

23:56.461 --> 23:58.326
Get some rest.

23:59.497 --> 24:01.522
You're going to need it.

24:05.570 --> 24:06.764
Dad?

24:11.209 --> 24:13.006
I'll bring it back.

24:14.012 --> 24:17.846
You'd better, or I'll kick
your ass. It's a good lighter.

24:49.112 --> 24:50.773
Sharon. Wake up.

25:00.090 --> 25:03.253
What the frack! You
killed her... Let me see.

25:14.371 --> 25:16.601
We got to go. Right now.

25:17.674 --> 25:19.266
Wait a minute.
I saw her on my lap.

25:19.342 --> 25:21.207
I saw her blood spill
on my lap.

25:21.278 --> 25:23.075
Let's move, mister.

25:32.055 --> 25:36.492
What the hell is going on? I don't
know. We'll figure it out later.

25:45.268 --> 25:47.930
Jump complete, sir. Dradis
reports nothing but hash.

25:48.004 --> 25:50.632
Just as we expected.
Can't see a thing.

25:50.707 --> 25:52.834
We are now within launch range
of the Cylon base.

25:52.909 --> 25:54.137
<i>Carrier Constellation,</i>

25:54.211 --> 25:56.236
<i>jump complete on station,
point Deacon.</i>

25:56.313 --> 25:57.940
<i>Initiate search pattern Delta.</i>

25:58.215 --> 26:00.877
<i>Ore flight
Bravo. Delta, Wilco.</i>

26:01.184 --> 26:03.414
<i>Ore flight
Nebula, Delta initiated.</i>

26:03.520 --> 26:05.283
The ball's in play.

26:06.056 --> 26:08.286
You can bet
they heard that.

26:09.693 --> 26:12.389
Now they'll try
to locate the decoys.

26:12.562 --> 26:14.120
And when they do?

26:14.297 --> 26:17.391
If they take the bait,
all hell breaks loose.

26:18.168 --> 26:21.103
Until then?
We wait.

26:40.757 --> 26:42.054
<i>Galactica, Boomer.</i>

26:42.159 --> 26:44.389
Tally, 90 plus, headed Deacon.

26:44.461 --> 26:46.122
<i>Speed, 250.</i>

26:52.769 --> 26:54.498
<i>The Cylons
have seen the freighter.</i>

26:54.571 --> 26:56.869
<i>They're en route to intercept.</i>

26:57.741 --> 26:59.402
They took the bait.

26:59.643 --> 27:03.204
Mr. Gaeta, launch
Strike Force 1. Aye, sir.

27:04.247 --> 27:05.839
D, launch Strike Force 1.

27:05.982 --> 27:07.745
Attention. Pilots,
man your planes.

27:07.918 --> 27:09.943
<i>Pilots, man your planes.</i>

27:22.599 --> 27:26.057
How hard did they bite?
Boomer's report said 90 plus.

27:26.870 --> 27:28.770
They've launched
most of their fighter force.

27:37.714 --> 27:39.944
Give them hell, sir. Firing.

27:52.896 --> 27:54.761
Our attack force is away.

27:55.332 --> 27:57.323
I just hope that Lee can...

27:59.970 --> 28:01.938
Lee isn't the problem.

28:03.340 --> 28:06.241
You should take
a good look at yourself.

28:07.444 --> 28:09.742
I had to go through
the same transition.

28:09.913 --> 28:13.007
When you're in the cockpit,
you're in control.

28:13.383 --> 28:14.782
It's hard to give it up.

28:16.753 --> 28:20.484
It would just be a lot easier
if I was flying with them.

28:20.991 --> 28:24.518
All you can do now is wait, and
hope you didn't make any mistakes.

28:24.728 --> 28:27.720
I never wanted
this kind of responsibility.

28:28.865 --> 28:31.800
The Cylons never asked us
what we wanted.

28:32.636 --> 28:34.797
Welcome to the big leagues.

28:45.615 --> 28:47.207
<i>Galactica, Crashdown.</i>

28:47.284 --> 28:49.548
<i>Tally, 50 plus
on an intercept course.</i>

28:49.619 --> 28:51.644
Repeat. 50 plus inbound.

28:54.557 --> 28:55.922
What's that mean?

28:56.293 --> 28:59.387
It means that a Cylon patrol
spotted our attack force.

28:59.596 --> 29:02.622
The base sent out
50 more Raiders to intercept.

29:03.800 --> 29:05.324
Fifty Raiders?

29:05.969 --> 29:09.029
That means we're
outnumbered now 5-to-1?

29:09.906 --> 29:12.033
Weren't the decoys
supposed to take care of that?

29:12.175 --> 29:15.338
The Cylons were too
smart for that. Frack.

29:17.347 --> 29:20.578
Estimated time to strike
intercept, two minutes.

29:23.820 --> 29:24.844
Fireball...

29:24.921 --> 29:28.516
multiple bandits,
left 10 high, range 40.

29:28.825 --> 29:30.884
Weapons free. Committing.

29:33.463 --> 29:35.761
Hot Dog, visual tally, press.

29:36.366 --> 29:38.231
Hot Dog, break right.

29:44.441 --> 29:46.238
Fireball, your six.

29:48.278 --> 29:51.111
I'm hit! I'm hit! Can't eject!

29:51.381 --> 29:52.507
<i>It's stuck!</i>

29:52.582 --> 29:55.676
<i>Deadbolt, Spinner. Two
bandits closing your right side.</i>

29:55.819 --> 29:57.753
<i>No joy!</i>

30:04.094 --> 30:05.356
<i>Galactica, Hot Dog.</i>

30:05.428 --> 30:07.726
<i>Heavily engaged.
Mission outcome doubtful.</i>

30:07.797 --> 30:11.289
This sounds fracking awful. They're
getting cut to pieces out there.

30:12.602 --> 30:14.866
<i>Get out of there! Move!</i>

30:17.272 --> 30:18.899
<i>Deadbolt, right vertical, now!</i>

30:19.742 --> 30:22.074
<i>Dammit, take
a shot. Get him off me.</i>

30:22.444 --> 30:24.912
Mr. Gaeta, abort Strike 1.

30:25.381 --> 30:27.212
<i>Strike 1, Galactica.
Return to base.</i>

30:27.483 --> 30:29.644
Repeat. Abort your mission,
and return to base.

30:32.921 --> 30:34.115
<i>Galactica, Stubbs.</i>

30:34.189 --> 30:37.716
<i>Cylon strike force is turning away
from Deacon and inbound to Galactica.</i>

30:45.033 --> 30:47.024
Noting Raiders inbound.

30:49.638 --> 30:53.096
The Cylons heard our
transmission recall, didn't they?

30:53.175 --> 30:54.938
Does that mean
the first wave of Raiders...

30:55.010 --> 30:58.275
is ignoring the decoys,
and is coming after us?

30:58.814 --> 31:00.577
That's exactly what it means.

31:13.629 --> 31:17.565
<i>So, when are we going to launch the
reserve Vipers to defend Galactica?</i>

31:18.467 --> 31:22.597
There are no reserve Vipers.
Everything is on the board already.

31:25.774 --> 31:27.867
Now we play
for all the marbles.

31:28.043 --> 31:30.102
Starbuck, it's your plan.

31:36.685 --> 31:38.152
Mr. Gaeta...

31:39.188 --> 31:41.452
will you please tell D
to get on the scrambler...

31:41.523 --> 31:43.548
and inform Apollo
the back door is open?

31:43.625 --> 31:45.286
Aye, Lieutenant.

31:45.727 --> 31:47.786
D, please send a scrambler
to Capt. Apollo.

31:47.863 --> 31:50.661
Message reads,
"The back door is open. "

31:50.899 --> 31:54.027
<i>Apollo, Galactica. Back door
is open. Back door is open.</i>

31:54.269 --> 31:55.964
Godspeed, Apollo.

32:31.807 --> 32:34.037
Lt. Thrace,
why didn't you tell me...

32:34.109 --> 32:37.601
we had another attack force
hidden in the freighters?

32:39.248 --> 32:41.113
We... It was my decision.

32:41.183 --> 32:45.313
I routinely restrict tactical
details to those who need to know.

32:46.121 --> 32:47.952
Old habits die hard.

32:49.591 --> 32:51.855
So you still might
pull this off?

32:51.927 --> 32:54.657
If Dr. Baltar's
target information is correct.

32:54.963 --> 32:57.488
And whether we get blown to
pieces by those Cylon Raiders...

32:57.566 --> 32:59.193
heading toward us right now.

32:59.268 --> 33:01.964
Speaking of which,
I'm needed in CIC.

33:17.152 --> 33:19.450
Initial point in 5 seconds.

33:25.928 --> 33:28.453
Flak suppression unit
cleared hot.

33:30.999 --> 33:32.990
<i>Okay, let's do this.</i>

33:33.168 --> 33:35.500
Come on, Lee.
It's all on you.

33:42.911 --> 33:44.242
Incoming!

33:49.051 --> 33:51.781
<i>Weapons free.
By the numbers, people.</i>

34:01.997 --> 34:03.828
Target acquired.
Tone and lock.

34:04.499 --> 34:05.625
<i>Firing.</i>

34:06.001 --> 34:08.765
Tone and lock. Firing.

34:13.241 --> 34:14.936
What's got
into these fracking missiles?

34:15.010 --> 34:16.307
Come on.

34:16.979 --> 34:18.776
They're jamming
the guidance systems.

34:19.748 --> 34:20.942
<i>Strike 2, Apollo.</i>

34:21.016 --> 34:23.746
Then we get close enough so we
don't need the guidance systems.

34:23.819 --> 34:25.411
<i>We'll have to
blow this thing manually.</i>

34:25.487 --> 34:27.648
<i>Wilco, Apollo. Rolling in.</i>

34:31.960 --> 34:33.689
Chuckles! Chuckles!

34:37.265 --> 34:38.596
Oh, frack.

34:40.636 --> 34:43.002
Chuckles bought it.
He's going down!

34:47.142 --> 34:49.542
<i>Now they've got
our attack axis zeroed in.</i>

34:49.611 --> 34:51.272
<i>There's no way to
fracking get close.</i>

34:51.346 --> 34:52.335
Frack.

34:52.781 --> 34:53.907
There's got to be.

34:54.116 --> 34:55.743
<i>We've got to
get out of this flak.</i>

34:55.817 --> 34:59.253
<i>Let's get down below the deck,
down where the target is.</i>

35:02.424 --> 35:06.121
I've got an idea. I'm
going to take a closer look.

35:16.738 --> 35:18.137
Commander on deck.

35:18.206 --> 35:19.639
As you were.

35:19.741 --> 35:22.801
The first wave of Cylons will
be on us in three minutes.

35:22.978 --> 35:24.502
Notify the Strike 1 Vipers...

35:24.579 --> 35:27.446
that they can stop running and
blast those bastards to hell.

35:27.516 --> 35:28.505
Yes, sir.

35:28.583 --> 35:29.811
<i>Engaging Cylon fighters.</i>

35:29.885 --> 35:32.353
<i>Target acquired,
tone and lock.</i>

35:50.172 --> 35:52.333
No, don't do this, Lee.

35:53.041 --> 35:56.374
The conveyor tunnel's clear.
I'm going through it.

35:56.878 --> 35:58.903
You're out of
your fracking mind, Apollo.

36:02.684 --> 36:03.810
What's going on?

36:03.885 --> 36:07.013
Captain Apollo's flying
into the conveyor tunnel...

36:07.089 --> 36:10.058
hoping it will lead him
to the refinery.

36:11.560 --> 36:13.050
Has he gone raving mad?

36:13.128 --> 36:16.427
There's no way to ensure
it does anything of the kind.

36:28.910 --> 36:31.435
Come on, keep it together,
Lee. Keep it together.

36:34.449 --> 36:35.814
Oh, lords.

37:04.880 --> 37:06.745
<i>Okay, I'm through the tunnel.</i>

37:06.815 --> 37:09.215
<i>They can't get
a firing solution on me.</i>

37:15.423 --> 37:16.947
There you are.

37:17.726 --> 37:20.820
Okay. I've got you.
I've got you. I've got you.

37:20.896 --> 37:23.057
I've got you. I've got you.

38:01.036 --> 38:04.130
<i>Galactica, Apollo.</i>

38:04.940 --> 38:06.999
<i>Mission accomplished.</i>

38:07.108 --> 38:08.234
Yes!

38:17.152 --> 38:19.552
You can tell Dr. Baltar
he was right on the money.

38:19.621 --> 38:21.350
It's one hell
of a fireworks show.

38:21.423 --> 38:23.653
<i>And there's plenty more for us
back in the canyon...</i>

38:23.725 --> 38:25.886
<i>once this place is history.</i>

38:33.568 --> 38:35.502
Congratulations,
Doctor, it worked.

38:37.138 --> 38:38.400
It did.

38:43.712 --> 38:45.077
It worked.

38:52.387 --> 38:55.117
I'm sorry, Madam President,
I'm sorry.

38:56.524 --> 38:58.389
No need to apologize.

38:58.860 --> 39:01.658
Thanks to you, we have enough
fuel to last us a few years.

39:10.705 --> 39:12.070
Commander, Strike 1 reports...

39:12.140 --> 39:13.437
inbound Cylons are
bugging out.

39:13.508 --> 39:15.237
Request permission
to go after them, sir.

39:15.310 --> 39:18.473
Tell our people to pursue
and destroy. Affirmative.

39:19.014 --> 39:21.107
Strike 1, tear them up.

39:33.995 --> 39:36.054
Apollo, you
magnificent bastard.

39:36.131 --> 39:37.860
That was one hell of
a piece of flying...

39:37.933 --> 39:39.423
and I couldn't have done it
better myself.

39:39.501 --> 39:41.230
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.

39:41.303 --> 39:44.397
I said that I couldn't have
done it better myself.

39:44.606 --> 39:46.267
Well, thank you.

39:48.610 --> 39:50.271
I had my doubts.

39:51.479 --> 39:52.810
So did I.

39:52.914 --> 39:56.213
I wasn't sure that crazy-ass plan
of yours could even possibly work.

40:02.023 --> 40:03.718
You deserve this.

40:12.867 --> 40:14.095
Crash.

40:54.042 --> 40:57.011
Have you read the
Pythian Prophecy, Gaius?

40:57.445 --> 40:59.504
Not since the sixth grade.

41:00.281 --> 41:03.739
I can't say ancient history
is my favorite subject.

41:03.918 --> 41:06.682
You should have paid
closer attention.

41:07.489 --> 41:08.922
To what?

41:08.990 --> 41:13.154
"All of this has happened before.
All of this will happen again. "

41:15.697 --> 41:19.098
Everyone knows that verse.
What are you getting at?

41:22.003 --> 41:23.766
Remember this one?

41:24.706 --> 41:27.573
"Led by serpents
numbering two and ten. "

41:27.976 --> 41:31.139
The Vipers.
They're the serpents?

41:32.914 --> 41:36.645
There's a later verse, Gaius.
You should read it.

41:38.153 --> 41:40.951
"Though the outcome
favored the few...

41:41.122 --> 41:45.491
"it led to a confrontation
at the home of the gods. "

41:48.430 --> 41:52.924
Are you telling me that God guided
my finger to that target for some...

41:54.235 --> 41:56.328
arcane scriptural purpose?

41:57.839 --> 42:00.364
You are part of God's plan,
Gaius.

42:00.809 --> 42:03.778
So God wanted me
to destroy the Cylon base.

42:04.012 --> 42:08.108
You did well. You gave
yourself over to Him.

42:15.390 --> 42:17.290
Yes, I suppose I did.

42:19.894 --> 42:21.589
Yes, there's...

42:25.100 --> 42:28.501
There's really no other
logical explanation for it.

42:34.442 --> 42:36.933
I was...
Am.

42:47.122 --> 42:49.215
I am an instrument of God.
