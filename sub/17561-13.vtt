[instrumental music]

00:03.836 --> 00:05.255
- Hey, baby.
- Vic.

00:05.338 --> 00:07.340
Oh, my God,
you don't have your crutches.

00:07.424 --> 00:09.426
What? Oh. Oh, God, oh, ah!

00:09.509 --> 00:10.719
[chuckles]

00:10.802 --> 00:12.679
Mm. See what I did there?

00:12.762 --> 00:14.764
Hmm. Why are you
looking all gorgeous?

00:14.848 --> 00:16.766
Well, I am going to
meet my mother, alright?

00:16.850 --> 00:19.561
- So, I'll catch you later.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait!

00:19.644 --> 00:20.895
What, well, you want
some more lovin'?

00:20.979 --> 00:23.773
No! Your mom?
Yeah. You know what?

00:23.857 --> 00:25.650
I think it's time.
I think I'm ready to meet her.

00:25.734 --> 00:28.445
Uh, no, maybe not. Unh-unh.

00:28.528 --> 00:30.071
No, no, come on. Now, listen.

00:30.155 --> 00:31.906
I know all this time
I've been saying

00:31.990 --> 00:33.825
that I'm not ready
because I wasn't sure about us

00:33.908 --> 00:37.454
but now, you and me,
me and you, together and happy..

00:37.537 --> 00:39.122
I mean, she's gotta be wondering
why we've been together

00:39.205 --> 00:41.458
all this time and I've never
asked to meet her.

00:41.541 --> 00:43.918
No, no, she's cool with it.
Okay. Bye-bye.

00:44.002 --> 00:46.129
But-but-but-but
I'm ready to meet her.

00:46.212 --> 00:49.507
[chuckles]
But-but-but-but
she's not, you see?

00:49.591 --> 00:52.093
That's kind of why
you haven't met her.

00:52.177 --> 00:55.305
She doesn't want to meet me? Why
wouldn't she want to meet me?

00:55.388 --> 00:57.807
Well, my mom is kind of, uh..

00:57.891 --> 01:01.478
She has this-this idea
that, uh, ahem..

01:01.561 --> 01:02.854
Well, she thinks you're a tramp.

01:02.937 --> 01:04.022
[chuckles]

01:04.105 --> 01:05.147
- Excuse me?
- Yeah.

01:05.230 --> 01:06.983
Yeah, a big ho, actually.

01:07.066 --> 01:09.486
Um, seems to have a little
problem with the fact

01:09.569 --> 01:11.488
that, uh, you went out
and got drunk and married me

01:11.571 --> 01:12.781
on the first date.

01:12.864 --> 01:15.158
Me? You did that too, okay?

01:15.241 --> 01:18.453
So, that makes you a man ho.

01:18.536 --> 01:20.330
Honey, maybe in time, okay?

01:20.413 --> 01:22.081
No, no, no. Not in time.

01:22.165 --> 01:23.792
Okay, Val, please, trust me.

01:23.875 --> 01:25.335
I know my mom, okay?

01:25.418 --> 01:27.045
And we should really wait
until she's ready.

01:27.128 --> 01:28.755
No, you trust me, okay?

01:28.838 --> 01:30.882
You bring her here.
I-I need to meet her.

01:30.965 --> 01:34.594
She needs to see that I am not
the harlot that she thinks I am.

01:35.762 --> 01:37.180
Harlot?

01:37.263 --> 01:39.015
- Harlot.
- Okay.

01:39.098 --> 01:41.684
Quit it! Now, come on.
Just bring her here.

01:41.768 --> 01:43.186
Okay, except, honey,
she won't come.

01:43.269 --> 01:45.188
Yes, she will,
if you don't tell her

01:45.271 --> 01:46.606
that this is my bakery.

01:46.689 --> 01:49.275
Okay, look,
here's what you're gonna do.

01:49.359 --> 01:50.568
You are gonna bring her here

01:50.652 --> 01:52.195
and then I'm gonna charm
the crap out of her.

01:52.278 --> 01:55.657
I'm gonna force that old broad
to fall in love with me, dammit!

01:55.740 --> 01:58.743
Eh, that-that's not
the charming part.

01:58.827 --> 02:00.370
- See you later.
- Bye.

02:01.788 --> 02:03.540
Are you done? Are you full?
That's a lot of bacon.

02:03.623 --> 02:05.083
You've been chewing for a while.

02:05.166 --> 02:06.459
What is the big rush?

02:06.543 --> 02:07.627
You said you didn't
have to meet that Robyn

02:07.710 --> 02:09.503
for another half-hour.

02:09.586 --> 02:12.048
Come on, baby.
I haven't seen you all week.

02:12.131 --> 02:15.385
Well, you're about to see
a whole lot more of me. Come on.

02:15.468 --> 02:16.845
- What?
- Come.

02:19.681 --> 02:20.849
[gasps]

02:23.143 --> 02:25.520
Oh, my gosh!
You're on a bus bench?

02:25.603 --> 02:28.231
[gasps]
Vince, look
how big your head is!

02:28.314 --> 02:30.233
I have a big head!

02:30.316 --> 02:32.735
People trust people
with big heads.

02:33.987 --> 02:36.865
Hmm. Yes!
You know what? You're right!

02:36.948 --> 02:40.159
Who wouldn't buy an apartment
from that big head?

02:43.830 --> 02:46.875
What is her head
doing next to your head?

02:46.958 --> 02:48.835
Well, I didn't want to
tell you until it was final

02:48.918 --> 02:52.797
but Robyn thought it would be a
good idea if we became partners.

02:55.550 --> 02:57.552
Oh. Partners.

02:57.635 --> 03:00.430
Super! Super partners!

03:00.513 --> 03:02.599
Holly, I know you're a little
worried about Robyn

03:02.682 --> 03:05.351
but it's so all about business
with us, and I'm so excited.

03:05.435 --> 03:08.229
She's teaching me so much,
and this is so good.

03:08.313 --> 03:11.232
Oh, you know what?
Who isn't excited?

03:11.316 --> 03:13.276
It's the coolest thing
ever, Vince.

03:13.359 --> 03:16.362
Now, go have fun at work and say
hello to your partner, Robyn.

03:16.446 --> 03:18.698
- Mm. I love you.
- I love you. Mwah!

[instrumental music]

04:11.292 --> 04:14.420
Oh. Oh, God. There's the mother.

04:14.504 --> 04:17.632
Oh, yeah. She's had work.

04:17.714 --> 04:19.884
- She looks mean. Maybe I--
- Go, go, go, go, go.

04:19.968 --> 04:23.012
Okay. Okay, fine.
You don't have to meet her.

04:23.096 --> 04:25.306
- What can I do you for?
- Uh, you know what?

04:25.390 --> 04:26.683
We have decided
we're not gonna stay

04:26.766 --> 04:28.184
but thank you anyway, miss.

04:28.267 --> 04:29.936
- Why don't we ask her?
- Ma, no.

04:30.019 --> 04:33.773
Miss, what if your baby went
off to some godforsaken place

04:33.856 --> 04:36.943
like Atlantic City, met a floozy
and an hour later married her?

04:37.026 --> 04:39.320
Wouldn't you want
to kill yourself?

04:40.321 --> 04:41.864
Well, uh, gosh.

04:41.948 --> 04:44.617
I'd want to meet the girl first
'cause I'm sure the son

04:44.701 --> 04:47.662
if he were yours,
would pick a, you know

04:47.745 --> 04:50.415
sweet, poised,
conservative, classy gal

04:50.498 --> 04:52.792
one who's just
going through a rough patch.

04:52.875 --> 04:55.461
Oh, God, you're her.

04:55.545 --> 04:56.921
- Hi.
- Yeah. Heh.

04:57.005 --> 05:00.925
Uh, ma, this is...Val, my wife.

05:01.009 --> 05:04.220
And, um, Val, this is my mom

05:04.303 --> 05:07.098
don't say anything mean, Eileen.

05:07.181 --> 05:08.725
Vic, it's okay.

05:08.808 --> 05:11.436
Your mother has every
right to feel angry.

05:11.519 --> 05:13.938
She missed one of the biggest
moments of your life.

05:14.022 --> 05:15.732
I'm sure
you're very disappointed

05:15.815 --> 05:19.485
and I am very much,
partly to blame for that.

05:19.569 --> 05:23.072
Well, the good news is I'm sure
he's going to marry again.

05:23.156 --> 05:24.949
Okay. Uh, mom,
why don't you and I go?

05:25.033 --> 05:26.451
I'll take you out
for a really nice lunch.

05:26.534 --> 05:28.911
No, no, no. You go.
Leave your mother with me.

05:28.995 --> 05:31.831
She and I need to spend some
time getting to know each other.

05:31.914 --> 05:34.125
Oh, God.

05:34.208 --> 05:36.127
See? She wants to too. Heh heh.

05:36.210 --> 05:37.712
Uh, Val, are you sure that you--

05:37.795 --> 05:39.797
Yeah, yeah, I got it, baby. Go.

05:39.881 --> 05:42.467
Um, mom, you know,
I-I would really love it

05:42.550 --> 05:43.760
if you two would
get to know each other.

05:43.843 --> 05:45.136
Well, for you, baby, anything.

05:45.219 --> 05:46.804
Okay. Thanks, mom.

05:46.888 --> 05:49.223
Oh, we're going to get
to know each other.

05:49.307 --> 05:52.060
[chuckles]
Ow, ow, ow.

05:52.143 --> 05:55.855
Mrs. Meladeo, the owner
sent this over for you

05:55.938 --> 05:58.274
and, may I say, she's such
a generous, thoughtful

05:58.357 --> 05:59.442
considerate, untrampy--

05:59.525 --> 06:01.569
Okay, thanks
for the wine, Gary.

06:01.652 --> 06:03.446
Mm-hmm.

06:03.529 --> 06:04.655
[chuckles]
Alrighty.

06:04.739 --> 06:06.532
Uh, to new beginnings.

06:06.616 --> 06:09.202
- No, thank you.
- Ugh. Come on.

06:09.285 --> 06:12.955
I find that when people drink,
they like me so much more, heh.

06:16.834 --> 06:18.503
Okay, look, I get it.

06:18.586 --> 06:20.463
I understand
why you don't like me

06:20.546 --> 06:22.924
why you wouldn't want to open up
and have a toast with me

06:23.007 --> 06:24.967
because when people
share a toast that means

06:25.051 --> 06:27.804
that they like each other
and that they're friends.

06:27.887 --> 06:31.849
Or sometimes it's just because
it's too painful and hopeless.

06:31.933 --> 06:34.977
[laughing]

06:37.980 --> 06:39.899
[instrumental music]

06:41.234 --> 06:43.361
So, once Vince's head
gets big from seeing

06:43.444 --> 06:45.363
his big old head on that bench

06:45.446 --> 06:46.906
do you think they're gonna
have to make a bigger bench

06:46.989 --> 06:49.367
to fit his bigger head?

06:49.450 --> 06:50.993
Is someone a little jealous?

06:51.077 --> 06:53.287
No, I think you got it
the other way around.

06:54.372 --> 06:55.540
Bam!

06:59.627 --> 07:02.797
It's hot chocolate
served by hot chocolate.

07:04.966 --> 07:06.342
Ugh! Ugh!

07:06.425 --> 07:09.011
- Did you see the atrocity?
- My God, how could you miss it?

07:09.095 --> 07:11.264
Vince and that Robyn
are plastered all over the city.

07:11.347 --> 07:13.599
Okay. So, we got to get us
some giant sharpies.

07:13.683 --> 07:16.352
I'm thinking black teeth
and her original nose.

07:16.435 --> 07:18.271
[laughing]

07:18.354 --> 07:21.107
Oh, come on, Holly.
You're better than that.

07:21.190 --> 07:23.985
[sighs]
You're right.

07:24.068 --> 07:28.823
[gasps]
How about Dumbo ears
and a Hitler moustache?

07:28.906 --> 07:30.783
No, I mean you need to come up
with a smarter plan

07:30.867 --> 07:32.243
to deal with
the whole Robyn situation.

07:32.326 --> 07:33.953
Wait, wait, you don't think
I have a plan?

07:34.036 --> 07:36.539
[scoffs]
I have a plan.

07:36.622 --> 07:39.542
Hey, Holly. I think
the mom's starting to dig me.

07:39.625 --> 07:41.085
[gasps]
Good!

07:41.169 --> 07:42.461
See? That is my plan.

07:42.545 --> 07:44.714
You keep your friends close
and your enemies closer.

07:44.797 --> 07:46.799
Mm. Exactly.

07:46.883 --> 07:50.428
Feeling a little
less pain, mama?

07:50.511 --> 07:51.888
So I invited Robyn to lunch

07:51.971 --> 07:53.848
because the more time
that she spends with me..

07:53.931 --> 07:56.475
The less time she spends
with Vince. Genius.

07:56.559 --> 07:59.228
Oh, I know.

07:59.312 --> 08:01.314
Oh, my God, biatch is coming.
Biatch is coming!

08:01.397 --> 08:03.691
- Shh!
- You got to act all.. Hi!

08:03.774 --> 08:06.360
Hi, Holly. Hey..

08:06.444 --> 08:08.529
- Tina.
- Nice to meet you.

08:08.613 --> 08:10.990
We've met like six times, but..

08:12.617 --> 08:15.369
So, congratulations on the whole
bus bench and partnership.

08:15.453 --> 08:17.830
Oh, I haven't seen
my partner all day.

08:17.914 --> 08:19.707
Why is that, hon?

08:19.790 --> 08:21.959
Well, uh, we were supposed
to have a business lunch

08:22.043 --> 08:24.420
but then you called me,
and, well, here I am.

08:24.503 --> 08:26.047
[both chuckling]

08:26.130 --> 08:27.298
Nice.

08:28.174 --> 08:29.592
Listen, uh, before we order

08:29.675 --> 08:31.677
I really have to go to
the little girls' room.

08:31.761 --> 08:33.888
Would you mind watching
my stuff for two sec?

08:33.971 --> 08:35.765
Not a problem,
girlfriend, and you take

08:35.847 --> 08:37.975
as long as you need in there!

08:38.058 --> 08:41.562
Like slutty putty in my hands.

08:41.645 --> 08:44.440
- Okay.
- Tina, what are you doing?

08:44.524 --> 08:46.943
Well, now that we're all friends
I'm going through her stuff.

08:47.026 --> 08:49.445
We cannot look at her pictures

08:49.528 --> 08:51.072
unless the pictures
fall on the floor

08:51.155 --> 08:53.824
and, you know, girlfriend
would have to pick them up.

08:57.495 --> 08:59.622
Okay. It looks like it was
her birthday or something.

08:59.705 --> 09:01.791
[gasps]
Well, I guess that
is proof that she was born

09:01.874 --> 09:04.043
and not sent here from hell.

09:04.126 --> 09:05.544
- Oh, my God.
- What?

09:05.628 --> 09:08.089
[gasps]
Oh, my God. Vince.

09:08.172 --> 09:09.924
Wait, wait, when were
these pictures taken?

09:10.007 --> 09:11.801
Well, um, it looks like they
were at a Chili's and there's

09:11.884 --> 09:14.053
a platter of ribs, so it
could be rib Wednesday or--

09:14.136 --> 09:15.513
Wait, look at the date
in the corner.

09:15.596 --> 09:19.225
- Or there's that.
- Ha! That was yesterday.

09:19.308 --> 09:21.602
But Vince said that he was
working late at the office.

09:21.686 --> 09:23.104
[gasps]

09:23.187 --> 09:25.022
Liar!

09:25.106 --> 09:26.983
You know, it is gonna be
very awkward getting through

09:27.066 --> 09:28.359
the rest of lunch
knowing that she went out

09:28.442 --> 09:29.860
with your boyfriend last night.

09:29.944 --> 09:33.155
Oh, there will be
no rest of the lunch.

09:33.239 --> 09:35.074
Well.. What are you gonna do?

09:35.157 --> 09:37.493
Ho-ho! Ho-ho!

09:37.576 --> 09:38.995
Heh heh. You have no idea.

09:39.078 --> 09:40.496
No-ho.

09:42.832 --> 09:44.917
[instrumental music]

09:47.461 --> 09:50.131
[both laughing]

09:50.214 --> 09:51.674
Oh, here. You want some more?

09:51.757 --> 09:54.135
Oh, well, you're doing it
yourself. Alright.

09:55.261 --> 09:56.846
Ooh-wee, it's been a long time

09:56.929 --> 09:59.849
since I've downed a bottle
of wine with a girlfriend.

09:59.932 --> 10:02.226
- Oh, I'm your girlfriend?
- Yeah, why not?

10:02.310 --> 10:04.353
Well, the rest of mine are dead.

10:04.437 --> 10:05.438
[sobbing]

10:05.521 --> 10:06.981
Oh, God, you're serious.

10:07.064 --> 10:09.191
- I'm sorry.
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

10:09.275 --> 10:11.527
It's just the booze talking.

10:11.610 --> 10:14.280
Oh, speaking of which,
I don't think

10:14.363 --> 10:16.866
we should mention
our little happy hour to Vic.

10:16.949 --> 10:19.535
Oh, why not?
He'll be so happy we bonded.

10:19.618 --> 10:23.539
Yeah. Maybe if
I wasn't an alcoholic.

10:23.622 --> 10:25.666
Say what, mama?

10:25.750 --> 10:28.377
My name is Eileen.
I'm an alcoholic.

10:28.461 --> 10:30.546
[laughing]

10:30.629 --> 10:34.383
Four years, three months,
two weeks, totally blown.

10:34.467 --> 10:35.634
Oh-oh. Ahh.

10:35.718 --> 10:37.678
Oh, my God, Eileen,
why didn't you tell me?

10:37.762 --> 10:39.513
- I never would have--
- Oh, honey, it's alright.

10:39.597 --> 10:42.558
You know what they say,
one day at a time.

10:42.641 --> 10:45.478
Boy, this day is shot.

10:45.561 --> 10:48.773
Well, I'm just gonna go
in and powder my nose

10:48.856 --> 10:51.609
and then we'll go to a real bar.

10:55.654 --> 10:57.615
Oh, my God, Lauren.

10:57.698 --> 10:59.075
All I wanted to do
was get her to like me

10:59.158 --> 11:00.201
and look what happened?

11:00.284 --> 11:02.328
Yeah, I know!
You guys are besties!

11:02.411 --> 11:03.829
That's because
she is an alcoholic

11:03.913 --> 11:05.748
and I just pushed her
off the wagon!

11:05.831 --> 11:07.750
Oh, God, everything
is such a mess.

11:07.833 --> 11:09.627
I was gonna charm her,
you know, take her uptown

11:09.710 --> 11:12.922
buy her a scarf, a brooch,
maybe some Jean Nate splash

11:13.005 --> 11:14.423
you know, mom stuff.

11:14.507 --> 11:16.092
Honey, believe me,
things could be worse.

11:16.175 --> 11:17.927
Oh, how could things
be worse, Lauren?

11:18.010 --> 11:20.346
- Hey, baby.
- That would be your example.

11:20.429 --> 11:21.764
Hey, I came to rescue you.

11:21.847 --> 11:23.766
Now, admit it, my mom
is a piece of work, huh?

11:23.849 --> 11:27.520
That's more like
a piece of delightful.

11:27.603 --> 11:29.188
- Where you going?
- I'm going to the bathroom.

11:29.271 --> 11:31.190
- No, you can't do that.
- Uh, yeah, I can.

11:31.273 --> 11:35.194
- I've had a lot to drink today.
- Apple, far, tree.

11:35.277 --> 11:38.531
Uh, Lauren, when the plumber
finishes in the bathroom

11:38.614 --> 11:41.367
I need you to take him
directly outside

11:41.450 --> 11:43.661
so as not to allow
any of our customers to see him

11:43.744 --> 11:45.162
for he's very schmutzy.

11:45.246 --> 11:47.706
Mm. Our plumber, meaning..

11:47.790 --> 11:50.292
Yeah. Hmm.
That's the one. Good.

11:50.376 --> 11:52.044
Hi. So, so where is she?

11:52.128 --> 11:54.130
- Who's that, hon?
- My-my mother.

11:54.213 --> 11:56.173
Oh, she's a doll.

11:56.257 --> 11:58.050
- Yeah. So, where is she?
- Where is she? Where is she?

11:58.134 --> 12:01.554
Uh, where would she be?
Uh, she's shopping.

12:01.637 --> 12:04.140
Yes, and I am gonna
meet her in 15 minutes.

12:04.223 --> 12:05.724
Well, that is amazing!

12:05.808 --> 12:07.309
You did it! How did you do it?

12:07.393 --> 12:09.979
Well, let's just say I..

12:10.062 --> 12:13.357
- Oh! Missed you so much today!
- Oh! Ugh.

12:18.237 --> 12:20.322
Uh, well, I'm good.

12:21.782 --> 12:24.910
This is not the time
or place for that.

12:24.994 --> 12:28.080
[instrumental music]

12:32.543 --> 12:35.004
Alright,
but they're already faxing

12:35.087 --> 12:37.173
in offers on that property.

12:37.256 --> 12:38.799
Okay.

12:38.883 --> 12:41.427
[gasps]
There are no offers.

12:42.761 --> 12:44.305
See how I did that?

12:44.388 --> 12:47.349
- Oh, baby, I miss you.
- Mm-hmm.

12:47.433 --> 12:48.559
Of course, you do.

12:48.642 --> 12:50.895
Because you are always working.

12:50.978 --> 12:53.063
[chuckles]
Like last night

12:53.147 --> 12:55.149
when you were working
late at the office.

12:55.232 --> 12:56.567
- Yeah.
- Huh.

12:56.650 --> 13:00.613
So, what is it exactly
that you do at the office?

13:00.696 --> 13:03.782
I just want to get
a mental picture.

13:03.866 --> 13:07.286
You know, uh, filing, escrow
stuff, check mortgage rates.

13:07.369 --> 13:08.621
Oh, interesting.

13:08.704 --> 13:13.459
Do you ever check
mortgage rates in a Chili's?

13:13.542 --> 13:14.418
What?

13:14.502 --> 13:16.712
I saw a picture of you and Robyn

13:16.795 --> 13:19.215
but not on a bench, at a Chili's

13:19.298 --> 13:22.468
dated last night while you were
supposed to be at the office.

13:22.551 --> 13:24.553
- Holly, it was--
- Nuh-unh-ugh!

13:24.637 --> 13:29.308
You were having a beer,
she a margarita!

13:29.391 --> 13:31.060
Look, it-it was a work thing.

13:31.143 --> 13:33.103
It wasn't just me and Robyn.
Everyone was there.

13:33.187 --> 13:35.064
Oh, oh, oh, okay. So,
everyone was there? Hmm, wait.

13:35.147 --> 13:39.109
Uh, I didn't see me
in the pictures!

13:39.193 --> 13:42.112
- Why did you lie to me?
- Because of this.

13:42.196 --> 13:45.699
Every time I even mention
Robyn's name, you do this.

13:45.783 --> 13:47.326
I'm trying to avoid this!

13:47.409 --> 13:50.579
Well, I have
every reason to do this!

13:50.663 --> 13:53.249
Don't you see?
She is trying to seduce you.

13:53.332 --> 13:54.708
- Come on, Holly.
- She is!

13:54.792 --> 13:57.127
I am telling you, she wants you.

13:57.211 --> 13:58.629
She was even looking
at you in the pictures

13:58.712 --> 14:03.259
with the tilted head,
total come-on head!

14:03.342 --> 14:04.927
[no audio]

14:05.010 --> 14:08.013
You know what? I can't
even be around you right now.

14:08.097 --> 14:09.974
Oh, I can't be
around you even more!

14:10.057 --> 14:12.101
But too bad for me,
your freakin' giant head

14:12.184 --> 14:13.185
is everywhere!

14:13.269 --> 14:14.478
Ooh!

14:16.689 --> 14:18.691
- Hey, Vin.
- Hey.

14:18.774 --> 14:21.068
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, everything's cool.

14:21.151 --> 14:22.361
You know what? No, no, it's not.

14:22.444 --> 14:24.113
Holly and I just got
into this stupid fight.

14:24.196 --> 14:26.073
Oh, no. What happened?

14:26.156 --> 14:29.159
She thinks there's something
going on between us.

14:29.243 --> 14:31.870
- Us?
- I know.

14:31.954 --> 14:33.539
I am so sorry she thinks that.

14:33.622 --> 14:34.999
I'm sure you guys
will work it out.

14:35.082 --> 14:36.333
Well, come on,
let's go to the office.

14:36.417 --> 14:37.751
We really need to
run through the contracts.

14:37.835 --> 14:39.587
- Oh, I'll grab us a cab.
- Oh, God.

14:39.670 --> 14:43.007
It's rush hour. It's gonna take
us forever to get to the office.

14:43.090 --> 14:46.093
Well, I live right upstairs.
We could finish them there.

14:46.176 --> 14:48.262
Oh, yeah, whatever. That's cool.

14:51.015 --> 14:54.059
[instrumental music]

14:57.062 --> 14:59.106
Lauren, how are we gonna
get her to stay here

14:59.189 --> 15:01.150
once she realizes that
the bar we brought her to

15:01.233 --> 15:02.610
is really an AA meeting?

15:02.693 --> 15:04.612
You give her another drink.

15:04.695 --> 15:06.488
No, this is serious, okay?

15:06.572 --> 15:08.991
I have got to put her
back on that wagon.

15:09.074 --> 15:11.619
Alright. I put my face on.

15:11.702 --> 15:14.246
So, are you girls
ready to party?

15:14.330 --> 15:16.373
Okay, Eileen,
I just want you to know

15:16.457 --> 15:19.501
that I brought you here
because I care about you.

15:19.585 --> 15:23.547
Right. Okay. First round on me.

15:28.636 --> 15:31.138
What the hell is wrong with you?

15:31.221 --> 15:32.765
I-I-I'm so sorry, Eileen.

15:32.848 --> 15:34.808
I just, I felt so horrible
about what happened earlier.

15:34.892 --> 15:36.977
I just wanted to help you
get back on track.

15:37.061 --> 15:38.687
Oh, my God. That guy is cute!

15:38.771 --> 15:42.316
I should ask him out
for a drink. I mean pie.

15:42.399 --> 15:44.360
How 'bout you just stay
out of my business?

15:44.443 --> 15:46.445
No, no. Okay?

15:46.528 --> 15:47.655
Now, look.

15:47.738 --> 15:49.823
You are Vic's mother,
and he is my husband

15:49.907 --> 15:53.452
and that makes this my business,
so,<i> you,</i> get in there, lady.

15:53.535 --> 15:58.415
You know what?
I don't like you anymore.

15:58.499 --> 16:01.377
You know what?
I don't care anymore, alright?

16:01.460 --> 16:02.878
But we are family.

16:02.961 --> 16:05.422
Like it or not, I am gonna be
in your life for a long time.

16:05.506 --> 16:08.217
That's right, ha ha,
I'm talking Thanksgiving

16:08.300 --> 16:10.886
Christmas, New Year's Eve.
Well, we'll skip New Year's Eve.

16:10.969 --> 16:13.138
'Cause that's a big
boozing holiday.

16:13.222 --> 16:16.725
But if you need somebody
to hold your drinking hand

16:16.809 --> 16:19.436
to keep it busy, I will sit
with you all night long

16:19.520 --> 16:23.440
if that's what it takes,
'cause we're family.

16:23.524 --> 16:25.693
You don't sound like a tramp.

16:27.027 --> 16:29.113
I'm not a tramp.

16:29.196 --> 16:31.323
I'm a nice girl.

16:31.407 --> 16:33.992
And I love your son.

16:34.076 --> 16:36.578
I'm starting to see that.

16:36.662 --> 16:38.038
But not double, right?

16:38.122 --> 16:40.708
[both laughing]

16:40.791 --> 16:42.167
So, you want to go
in there or what?

16:42.251 --> 16:44.962
Val, now that we're so close

16:45.045 --> 16:49.425
maybe we could keep
my little slip between us?

16:49.508 --> 16:52.928
- What slip?
- Ohh.

16:53.011 --> 16:55.222
Okay, are you coming in,
Mrs. Meladeo?

16:55.305 --> 16:58.434
Uh, hello. It's anonymous.

16:58.517 --> 17:00.394
I'm sorry, Eileen.

17:01.895 --> 17:04.982
[instrumental music]

17:07.859 --> 17:09.611
[instrumental music]

17:10.863 --> 17:12.614
Hot chocolate break.

17:12.698 --> 17:15.451
Special recipe
passed down by my grandma.

17:15.534 --> 17:17.703
But I'll tell you the secret.

17:18.746 --> 17:20.164
Two packets.

17:21.957 --> 17:23.459
Listen, I felt really bad

17:23.541 --> 17:25.461
about causing a fight
between you and Holly.

17:25.544 --> 17:27.671
I sent her some flowers
and an apology note.

17:27.755 --> 17:30.466
- Hope it helps.
- You sent Holly flowers?

17:30.549 --> 17:32.092
That was really cool of you.

17:32.176 --> 17:34.052
[chuckles]
Ohh!

17:34.136 --> 17:35.262
I am such a klutz

17:35.345 --> 17:37.765
just arms and legs,
like daddy always says.

17:37.848 --> 17:39.600
Alright, you can rinse
that off in the bathroom.

17:39.683 --> 17:42.478
Oh, do you have a robe
or something I could put on?

17:42.561 --> 17:45.898
No, I usually just air-dry.

17:45.981 --> 17:48.317
But you can borrow a pair
of sweatpants and a shirt.

17:48.400 --> 17:49.777
Thanks.

17:54.072 --> 17:57.659
Gardenias? "I'm so sorry."

17:58.660 --> 18:01.622
Vince. No, I'm sorry.

18:02.956 --> 18:04.625
I love him.

18:06.210 --> 18:09.254
[instrumental music]

18:10.297 --> 18:11.590
I hope you don't mind.

18:11.673 --> 18:13.509
I used your toothbrush
to scrub out the stain

18:13.592 --> 18:14.885
so it wouldn't set.

18:14.968 --> 18:17.012
- Which toothbrush?
- Purple.

18:17.096 --> 18:19.014
[chuckles]
Gary's.

18:20.557 --> 18:22.601
Hey, this escrow period
is a joke.

18:22.684 --> 18:25.771
We need to get this down
to 45 days or this deal is off.

18:25.854 --> 18:27.731
Wow! Listen to you.

18:27.815 --> 18:30.108
You've turned into such a mogul.

18:30.192 --> 18:32.736
Today I was so impressed.

18:35.489 --> 18:37.741
You were amazing.

18:37.825 --> 18:40.619
Boy, you don't take no
for an answer, do you?

18:42.246 --> 18:43.914
Oh, my God.

18:44.748 --> 18:45.958
Holly.

18:49.711 --> 18:51.672
Holly, wait,
Robyn and I were working

18:51.755 --> 18:53.048
and she spilled something
on her dress.

18:53.131 --> 18:55.884
Okay. So she had to change
into something dry?

18:55.968 --> 18:57.678
Ha! The spill!

18:57.761 --> 19:01.098
It is a classic right out
of the ho handbook.

19:01.181 --> 19:02.891
Will you just admit
that she's after you?

19:02.975 --> 19:04.726
- She's not.
- She is!

19:04.810 --> 19:06.186
Holly, are you and I
gonna have this argument

19:06.270 --> 19:07.688
every time Robyn
and I are together?

19:07.771 --> 19:10.190
Just when she's in your pants!

19:10.274 --> 19:12.192
Well, I'm at a loss,
then, because Robyn and I

19:12.276 --> 19:13.986
are partners
and that's not gonna change.

19:14.069 --> 19:16.029
So, you tell me
what are we supposed to do?

19:16.113 --> 19:18.532
Okay, well, you know what,
if your situation with Robyn

19:18.615 --> 19:21.201
is not gonna change
then...obviously

19:21.285 --> 19:23.078
something else is gonna have to.

19:23.161 --> 19:27.332
Vince...I think
that you and I should..

19:29.418 --> 19:31.169
...think about
what we're gonna do.

19:31.253 --> 19:33.505
Are you saying
what I think you're saying?

19:33.589 --> 19:35.924
What do you think I'm saying?

19:36.008 --> 19:39.011
I think you're saying
we should take some time

19:39.094 --> 19:41.263
to think about
what we're going to do.

19:41.346 --> 19:42.431
Why are we
beating around the bush?

19:42.514 --> 19:44.892
Obviously,
what we need to do is..

19:47.019 --> 19:48.770
...think.

19:48.854 --> 19:51.356
About what we're going to do.

19:52.441 --> 19:54.026
Okay.

19:54.109 --> 19:55.944
So, it's decided, then?

19:56.028 --> 19:57.613
You and I are officially..

19:57.696 --> 19:59.781
Thinking.

19:59.865 --> 20:04.161
I guess I shouldn't wear this
while we're thinking.

20:04.244 --> 20:06.622
Val gave you that.

20:06.705 --> 20:09.416
Oh. Then we're good.

20:13.545 --> 20:16.924
Oh, I am so glad
Eileen is back on track.

20:17.007 --> 20:19.301
- To Eileen.
- Yeah.

20:19.384 --> 20:21.678
Wow, the guys
are so much hotter at AA

20:21.762 --> 20:24.139
than they are at
Overeaters Anonymous.

20:25.265 --> 20:26.767
Well, well, well.

20:26.850 --> 20:27.851
You were right.

20:27.935 --> 20:29.978
My mother is in love with you.

20:30.062 --> 20:31.146
What did you give her?

20:31.230 --> 20:33.148
- Nothing!
- Nothing!

20:33.231 --> 20:35.651
- Come on, baby, I want to know.
- Oh, well..

20:35.734 --> 20:37.611
Well, why are you
asking me so many questions?

20:37.694 --> 20:40.364
We had fun. We laughed.
I was charming. The end.

20:40.447 --> 20:42.240
No, baby, come here.
Come on. I-I want to know.

20:42.324 --> 20:44.868
Because, I mean, this morning
she hated you. What happened?

20:44.952 --> 20:46.370
Why are you so up in my grille?

20:46.453 --> 20:49.373
Well, baby, I just want
to know what you did, okay?

20:49.456 --> 20:51.458
Oh! Oh.

20:56.088 --> 20:58.465
