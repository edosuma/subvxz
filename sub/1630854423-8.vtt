00:14.348 --> 00:15.349
Hey, Ian.

00:16.683 --> 00:17.684
Hey, Dana.

00:18.894 --> 00:20.562
Is this your next big idea?

00:21.813 --> 00:23.065
No.

00:23.148 --> 00:27.361
In fact, this is holding me back
from having any ideas at all.

00:29.446 --> 00:31.031
What up, cobbers?

00:31.114 --> 00:32.406
Hey, Poppy, what is this?

00:32.491 --> 00:34.076
That is a Post-it.

00:34.159 --> 00:35.869
No, it's not. It's an eyesore,

00:35.953 --> 00:40.207
and every time I can't even--
Every time I turn around,

00:40.290 --> 00:42.709
I'm just pulled right back
to this piece of shit. No.

00:42.793 --> 00:44.294
Tough titties.

00:44.378 --> 00:46.046
Post-it notes are a part of my system.

00:46.129 --> 00:49.216
That's how I remember
my big ideas, 'cause I'm--

00:49.299 --> 00:51.885
I don't know if you heard,
but I'm having big ideas now too.

00:51.969 --> 00:52.970
Oh, really?

00:53.470 --> 00:54.555
What does "haptics" mean?

00:55.973 --> 00:57.099
Shouldn't you be working?

00:57.182 --> 00:59.393
I'll tell you what. This is basic, Poppy.

00:59.476 --> 01:00.561
-Right?
-Cheugy.

01:00.644 --> 01:01.478
Cheugy?

01:01.562 --> 01:03.355
-This is cheugy.
-You don't know what that means.

01:03.438 --> 01:05.440
-And you're cheugy as well.
-I don't know what that means.

01:05.524 --> 01:06.859
It's like "basic," but not as old.

01:08.527 --> 01:09.528
Thank you.

01:10.487 --> 01:12.573
We're gonna take a whole class
on social cues,

01:12.656 --> 01:14.449
but first, we're gonna deal with this.

01:15.117 --> 01:17.578
Can't you just take notes
like a normal person

01:17.661 --> 01:19.955
and put them into your phone?

01:20.038 --> 01:23.250
No, because like a normal person,
I lost my phone ages ago,

01:23.333 --> 01:25.002
and now Dana takes my calls for me.

01:25.085 --> 01:27.880
Don't nobody call you.
It's mad depressing.

01:27.963 --> 01:29.214
That's 'cause she's cheugy, right?

01:29.298 --> 01:31.258
-Nice usage.
-Thank you.

01:31.341 --> 01:33.051
Can you stop weighing in?

01:33.135 --> 01:35.888
Okay, you know what? If you can't
even remember what this means,

01:36.680 --> 01:38.015
then your system sucks.

01:38.640 --> 01:40.809
All right. Okay. Fine,

01:40.893 --> 01:43.228
but if we're gonna be talking
about broken systems,

01:43.312 --> 01:44.938
I would like to address
the air-conditioning.

01:45.022 --> 01:47.024
-Why? What's wrong with it?
-It's freezing in here.

01:47.733 --> 01:49.443
Poppy, how many times
have we been through this?

01:49.526 --> 01:52.738
I have chosen
this very specific temperature

01:52.821 --> 01:55.741
to optimize for peak brain function
and moisture retention.

01:55.824 --> 01:58.577
Why on earth
would I want to retain moisture?

01:58.660 --> 02:00.787
-I don't know. Ask your crow's-feet.
-What does-- What do you--

02:00.871 --> 02:02.915
When you look in the mirror,
do you not see the dry skin?

02:02.998 --> 02:04.958
I mean, Poppy,
you don't drink enough water.

02:05.042 --> 02:08.169
I get all the juice I need
from hard candy.

02:08.252 --> 02:10.923
You don't need juice. You need water.

02:11.006 --> 02:13.884
Okay, Dana, can you weigh in on this?
It's too cold in here, right?

02:14.801 --> 02:18.055
As much as I hate to agree with her,
it is freezing in here.

02:18.138 --> 02:21.433
That's two against one.
Who's cheugy now, bitch?

02:21.517 --> 02:24.061
All right, I'm gonna choose
the temperature of the office.

02:25.437 --> 02:28.190
I'm seeing something in the 70s.

02:28.273 --> 02:30.901
-No. Don't do that.
-In the 70s. Seventy-one?

02:30.984 --> 02:32.277
You're making fun of me, and--

02:33.070 --> 02:38.992
Office, set the temperature
to 22 degrees Celsius.

02:39.076 --> 02:40.285
Setting.

02:43.163 --> 02:44.164
That's so hot.

03:04.101 --> 03:05.352
Absolutely degrading.

03:05.435 --> 03:06.436
What is?

03:08.397 --> 03:10.607
I have an IQ of 132.

03:10.691 --> 03:13.443
In prison, I became the consigliere
for a prominent Italian gang

03:13.527 --> 03:14.820
in a matter of days.

03:14.903 --> 03:18.240
Now I'm pouring coffee for Rachel,
an adult woman who wears overalls,

03:18.323 --> 03:21.660
into her very special "kawaii neko" mug.

03:22.744 --> 03:23.954
I should've stayed in prison.

03:24.037 --> 03:26.623
-I would've been the don by now.
-Don't think of it like that.

03:26.707 --> 03:30.169
Sure, the individual tasks may be menial,
but our jobs are very important.

03:30.252 --> 03:32.921
I take a lot of pride in knowing
I'm assisting a powerful man,

03:33.005 --> 03:34.506
accomplishing powerful things.

03:43.265 --> 03:44.266
Back to work.

03:52.191 --> 03:53.192
Hey.

03:56.236 --> 03:57.654
Good. Looks-- Looking good.

04:00.073 --> 04:03.994
Okay, I don't want to panic
the employees, but we have a rat.

04:04.077 --> 04:04.953
Interesting.

04:05.037 --> 04:07.289
Yeah.
Jo, I need you to take care of it, okay?

04:07.372 --> 04:08.999
-Lucky.
-Consider it done.

04:09.082 --> 04:11.460
-Which department does the rat work in?
-What? No.

04:11.543 --> 04:15.214
It's an actual rat. Like, in my office.

04:15.297 --> 04:17.048
Are you accusing me?
I would never betray you.

04:17.132 --> 04:18.759
Sounds like something a rat would say.

04:18.841 --> 04:22.262
What? No. Guys, no.
I'm talking about an animal.

04:22.346 --> 04:23.764
We need an exterminator.

04:23.847 --> 04:26.517
Got it. This filthy, treasonous animal
cannot be allowed to live.

04:26.600 --> 04:27.851
-Nope.
-David,

04:27.935 --> 04:29.478
if you want someone
to handle your problem,

04:29.561 --> 04:30.812
talk to the guy who's been to prison.

04:30.896 --> 04:32.481
-Stop this.
-I know how to handle a rat.

04:32.564 --> 04:34.149
Ironically,
you might have to work with a mole.

04:34.233 --> 04:35.234
Stop it!

04:35.859 --> 04:39.238
I'm just gonna restart this conversation.
There is a mouse, right?

04:39.321 --> 04:43.617
A small, furry rodent with a tail, that is
in my office scurrying around. I saw it.

04:43.700 --> 04:45.244
You know what?
I'm gonna draw the damn thing.

04:45.327 --> 04:46.370
Excuse me. Sorry.

04:46.453 --> 04:48.914
I just figure,
make it nice and clear, right?

04:48.997 --> 04:51.166
'Cause this has four legs.

04:54.920 --> 04:57.339
So, yeah.
Can you just take care of it, please?

04:57.422 --> 05:00.676
And text me when you're done.
I'm gonna go work outside. Okay?

05:01.885 --> 05:03.428
Not because I'm afraid of the mouse.

05:04.137 --> 05:06.849
No, it's-- I was always
gonna do that. Just gonna work outside,

05:06.932 --> 05:09.393
because it's just such a--
It's a great day today. Beautiful.

05:09.476 --> 05:10.936
It's 90 degrees outside.

05:11.019 --> 05:13.272
I'm from Arizona, Jo. That's not that hot.

05:13.355 --> 05:15.065
It was 83 last week
and you almost passed out.

05:15.148 --> 05:16.900
I had to hold frozen peas
to your neck all day.

05:16.984 --> 05:18.861
Just get the goddamn rat. 'Kay?

05:21.113 --> 05:22.489
This is degrading.

05:22.573 --> 05:25.450
The only thing lower than a rat catcher
is a local news correspondent.

05:25.534 --> 05:27.077
Any idiot can do it.

05:28.537 --> 05:29.663
I disagree.

05:31.081 --> 05:33.417
Whether you're hunting a literal rat
or a metaphorical one,

05:33.500 --> 05:34.626
the principles are the same.

05:34.710 --> 05:36.753
Rats are cunning. Expert survivalists.

05:36.837 --> 05:38.255
They move under the cover of darkness

05:38.338 --> 05:41.508
and to catch them,
you need to set an unassailable trap.

05:44.970 --> 05:49.474
Yes. We are the perfect people
to handle this delicate mission.

05:49.975 --> 05:51.393
Let's catch ourselves a rat.

05:58.233 --> 06:01.820
David told us to be discreet.
The employees can't know what we're doing.

06:04.489 --> 06:08.702
Everyone, leave! Now!
You will not be provided with a reason.

06:09.536 --> 06:10.537
Go!

06:30.224 --> 06:31.225
What the hell?

06:31.892 --> 06:35.854
Hey. Ian!

06:36.522 --> 06:37.523
What?

06:39.942 --> 06:41.860
Did you turn the air-conditioning back on?

06:41.944 --> 06:42.819
No, I didn't touch it.

06:42.903 --> 06:44.780
Well,
then why can I feel air blowing around?

06:45.447 --> 06:48.158
Well, that's because
I programmed a gentle breeze.

06:48.242 --> 06:50.077
Because the office is Web3,

06:50.160 --> 06:54.331
it has the capability of adjusting
for minor changes in the microclimate.

06:54.414 --> 06:55.666
How's that not air-conditioning?

06:55.749 --> 06:57.793
Well, because I haven't conditioned
the air in any way.

06:57.876 --> 07:00.796
I've simply moved it around
in a different way.

07:00.879 --> 07:04.800
I could program, say, a draft instead
of a breeze. Would you like that?

07:04.883 --> 07:07.302
-No. I don't like it at all.
-How about a gust?

07:07.386 --> 07:08.679
Office, gust.

07:08.762 --> 07:10.138
Gusting.

07:10.639 --> 07:11.723
Are you messing with me?

07:11.807 --> 07:14.726
No, I'm simply trying
to find a compromise.

07:14.810 --> 07:17.187
Okay, well, I can't work like this.

07:17.271 --> 07:18.272
Well, neither can I.

07:18.355 --> 07:20.315
Well, you're not really working, are you?

07:20.399 --> 07:24.653
I'm building an entire game
from scratch, and you're, you know,

07:24.736 --> 07:27.948
pacing around and giving
yourself handies in the metaverse.

07:28.031 --> 07:32.244
Just because I don't sit in front of
a desk all day long staring at a screen,

07:32.327 --> 07:33.829
doesn't mean that I'm not working.

07:33.912 --> 07:36.623
I am trying to propel GrimPop
into the future,

07:36.707 --> 07:38.292
and I can't do that in this environment.

07:38.375 --> 07:41.962
Your brain can't function
unless the air in here is so cold

07:42.045 --> 07:43.755
that my nipples tear out of my jumper?

07:43.839 --> 07:46.884
Why are we talking about your nipples?
And what is a "jumper"?

07:46.967 --> 07:49.136
-A jumper.
-A "jumper"?

07:49.219 --> 07:50.470
A jumper. My jumper.

07:50.554 --> 07:52.222
-What is a "jumper"?
-A jumper!

07:52.306 --> 07:54.433
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-A jumper!

07:57.686 --> 08:00.689
Dana.

08:00.772 --> 08:03.192
Dana.

08:05.319 --> 08:07.237
Dana.

08:07.321 --> 08:11.742
-Dana.
-Dana.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.577
Dana.

08:13.660 --> 08:16.121
-What?
-Hi, could you just back me up here?

08:16.205 --> 08:17.789
-We can't work like this.
-Will you back me up?

08:17.873 --> 08:20.292
-Back me up. Can't work like this.
-I can't work like this.

08:20.375 --> 08:22.002
-It's clear we all can't work like this.
-We--

08:22.085 --> 08:23.003
Work like what?

08:23.086 --> 08:24.588
-Well, the breeze. The breeze.
-Yeah--

08:24.671 --> 08:25.672
He's made a breeze

08:25.756 --> 08:28.091
and it's distracting the shit out of us.

08:28.175 --> 08:29.843
Right now, you're distracting me.

08:29.927 --> 08:31.512
-Come on!
-See? That's what I'm talking about.

08:31.595 --> 08:33.013
-Can't you side with me for once?
-No.

08:33.096 --> 08:34.847
-We're the women. Team women.
-You can't do that!

08:34.932 --> 08:36.225
-You. Me.
-You can't influence the judge.

08:38.352 --> 08:39.977
I am not the judge. Okay?

08:40.062 --> 08:41.605
Will you please just leave me alone?

08:42.231 --> 08:44.983
I am trying to work on Playpen!

08:45.067 --> 08:46.985
Which is
what you should be doing right now.

08:47.069 --> 08:48.737
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

08:49.530 --> 08:50.364
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

08:50.447 --> 08:51.865
-Yeah.
-That's what-- Yeah.

08:51.949 --> 08:53.200
Yeah. That's what I was saying.

08:53.283 --> 08:55.536
-Okay, cool. Thank you.
-That's what I've been trying to do.

08:55.619 --> 08:56.954
-Thank you.
-Thanks, Dana.

08:57.037 --> 09:00.374
-Well, that was clearly inconclusive…
-Right. Clearly.

09:00.457 --> 09:02.000
…so, therefore the breeze remains.

09:02.084 --> 09:03.919
Fine, keep your stupid breeze.

09:04.002 --> 09:06.839
Office, turn the lights down to 70%.

09:06.922 --> 09:08.090
Dimming.

09:08.173 --> 09:09.299
Wait. What is that?

09:09.383 --> 09:12.594
The bright lights make it very difficult
for me to read my screen.

09:13.220 --> 09:17.891
Poppy,
the lights are programmed to coincide

09:17.975 --> 09:19.351
with our circadian rhythms.

09:19.434 --> 09:23.522
We need to align ourselves with
the cycles of what's going on outside.

09:23.605 --> 09:27.568
Therefore, I have engineered
the lights to mimic the path

09:27.651 --> 09:29.820
of the sun across the sky
on any given day.

09:29.903 --> 09:34.032
Okay, you know what else is engineered
to do that?

09:34.700 --> 09:36.201
Fucking windows.

09:40.497 --> 09:42.165
-Office, lights up.
-Raising.

09:42.666 --> 09:44.543
-Office, lights down.
-Dimming.

09:44.626 --> 09:46.170
-Office, lights up.
-Raising.

09:46.253 --> 09:47.379
-Office, lights down.
-Dimming.

09:47.462 --> 09:49.464
-Office, lights up.
-Raising.

09:49.548 --> 09:51.675
-Office, lights down.
-Dimming.

09:51.758 --> 09:53.552
-Office, lights up.
-Raising.

09:58.974 --> 10:00.976
-No, do not listen to his--
-Go strobe! No, yeah.

10:03.854 --> 10:05.272
No, yeah. Strobe on.

10:05.355 --> 10:06.899
-This is unnecessary.
-Office, stop!

10:06.982 --> 10:07.983
Stopping.

10:08.066 --> 10:10.736
-Office, lights off.
-Lights off.

10:10.819 --> 10:12.779
Oh, right. Well, that's just childish.

10:12.863 --> 10:15.282
I mean, come on. Office, lights on.

10:15.365 --> 10:16.533
Lights on.

10:17.159 --> 10:18.285
Wait, where'd she go?

10:21.705 --> 10:24.499
Office, bring Dana back.

10:26.585 --> 10:29.338
-Kinda thought that was gonna work.
-I thought for a split second, right.

10:36.261 --> 10:38.514
Hey, David. What are you doing out here?

10:38.597 --> 10:40.807
Hey. Just, you know, just chillin'.

10:40.891 --> 10:41.934
-Chillin'?
-Yeah.

10:42.017 --> 10:43.018
You lookin' mad sweaty.

10:43.101 --> 10:44.603
Yeah. Yeah, it's hot. It's a lot of sun.

10:44.686 --> 10:46.063
Do you have sunglasses, or a hat,

10:46.146 --> 10:48.106
or, like, a parasol or something?

10:48.190 --> 10:49.983
No. I don't know what that is.

10:50.067 --> 10:53.111
-Doesn't matter. What are you up to?
-Well, I can't work in our office.

10:53.195 --> 10:54.696
Poppy and Ian are driving me nuts.

10:54.780 --> 10:56.156
They're constantly fighting

10:56.240 --> 10:57.491
about stupid shit that doesn't matter.

10:57.574 --> 11:00.786
And then they pull me into it
like I'm goddamn Judge Judy.

11:00.869 --> 11:02.120
-You feel me?
-I feel you.

11:02.621 --> 11:03.622
Can I say that?

11:03.705 --> 11:05.958
-You can say it if I say it first.
-Right, that makes sense.

11:06.041 --> 11:08.836
I mean, it's literally impossible
to get anything done.

11:09.336 --> 11:12.673
They are taking over our entire office
with this shit.

11:12.756 --> 11:13.632
Trust me, I know.

11:13.715 --> 11:16.260
One time they were arguing over
the color of Ian's T-shirt.

11:16.343 --> 11:18.679
They brought in the art department
in the middle of the night

11:18.762 --> 11:20.347
to determine whether it was true black.

11:21.139 --> 11:22.307
That's nothing.

11:22.391 --> 11:24.977
One time,
Ian said, "For all intensive purposes,"

11:25.060 --> 11:28.522
and Poppy hammered him so hard about it,
then pulled out a dictionary.

11:28.605 --> 11:31.233
-And Ian said, "I don't…
-…do dictionaries."

11:31.817 --> 11:32.901
What does that even mean?

11:32.985 --> 11:34.653
I don't know.
I've seen him use a dictionary.

11:34.736 --> 11:36.905
-They're the worst.
-Yeah, really are.

11:36.989 --> 11:39.074
Sup, David? Hey, man.
Lookin' really sweaty.

11:39.157 --> 11:40.951
Yeah, Anthony, why aren't you at work?

11:41.034 --> 11:43.537
Your crazy assistant
threw us out of the office.

11:43.620 --> 11:45.122
So now we're all hanging out here.

11:45.205 --> 11:47.207
You look like you're having a stroke.
It looks crazy.

11:47.291 --> 11:49.793
Wait, so the entire office is empty?

11:49.877 --> 11:51.086
I guess so.

11:51.170 --> 11:52.421
I gave Jo one task.

11:53.046 --> 11:54.047
We have a rat.

11:54.548 --> 11:55.757
Who is it?

11:57.176 --> 12:00.470
Don't even, okay? I can't deal with this.
I gotta go back to the office.

12:00.554 --> 12:02.556
-Wait, do you have AC?
-Yeah.

12:02.639 --> 12:04.933
AC and an empty office?
I'm comin' with you.

12:06.560 --> 12:07.561
Another day done.

12:08.478 --> 12:11.481
Of course, the nighttime
is when the janitor's work begins,

12:12.524 --> 12:13.942
because everyone else is gone.

12:15.944 --> 12:19.990
Yeah, just me and a big,
empty office filled with crumbs.

12:20.073 --> 12:21.909
-Trap is set.
-Good.

12:21.992 --> 12:22.993
Keep moving.

12:23.076 --> 12:25.829
Yeah, I see a lot of crumbs out here.
Fortunately, I lack the requisite pride

12:25.913 --> 12:27.122
in my work to clean it up.

12:27.206 --> 12:28.207
Nice.

12:28.290 --> 12:31.460
Play dumb. Let him think he's in control.

12:31.543 --> 12:32.544
Or she.

12:34.796 --> 12:36.215
Brad? What is it?

12:40.052 --> 12:41.303
It's close.

12:41.386 --> 12:43.931
Stay calm. Let him come to us.

12:44.014 --> 12:45.766
Why did we go for a humane trap?

12:45.849 --> 12:48.852
Because I wanna look into its beady
little eyes when I deliver the kill shot.

12:48.936 --> 12:51.563
-You were gonna shoot it?
-Yeah. What were you planning?

12:51.647 --> 12:54.650
Slowly submerging it into a bucket,
so we could taunt it while it drowns.

12:54.733 --> 12:56.109
I miss these talks.

12:59.446 --> 13:02.658
-What's goin' on?
-We're blown. Shoot.

13:02.741 --> 13:03.909
Thanks a lot, David.

13:03.992 --> 13:05.869
-Hey, guys.
-Hi, Dana.

13:07.287 --> 13:08.288
All right, I'm out.

13:09.665 --> 13:12.376
-What are you two doing?
-Nothing now. You bungled our operation.

13:12.459 --> 13:13.752
Your operation?

13:13.836 --> 13:15.712
I gave you a simple task,
to look for--

13:20.133 --> 13:21.468
Fascinating.

13:22.261 --> 13:24.471
Okay, so it came out
when the lights were on. Why is that?

13:24.555 --> 13:27.558
-Why does anyone do anything?
-Sex, power, greed.

13:27.641 --> 13:30.352
Precisely. Only this rat chose
to steal foam from a chair

13:30.435 --> 13:32.062
instead of nibbling on a delicious cookie.

13:32.145 --> 13:35.190
Excuse me. Why are we profiling a rodent?
We need to call an exterminator.

13:35.274 --> 13:37.609
We might not need it.
It seems like this rat has a death wish.

13:37.693 --> 13:39.319
Or maybe a life wish.

13:40.279 --> 13:42.155
I think I know what kind of rat
we're dealing with.

13:42.865 --> 13:44.324
And I know how to catch it.

13:56.670 --> 13:58.213
-Hey.
-Have you just been waiting out here

13:58.297 --> 14:00.132
-for me to pee?
-No, actually, I've been--

14:01.133 --> 14:03.135
-Have you been peeing this entire time?
-Yeah.

14:03.218 --> 14:06.138
Dude, I've been out here
for, like, 25 minutes.

14:06.221 --> 14:07.681
How long does it take you to pee?

14:08.348 --> 14:10.142
You need to drink more water.

14:10.225 --> 14:12.769
-I feel bad for your kidneys.
-What do you want?

14:12.853 --> 14:14.897
Okay. We'll deal with this later.

14:14.980 --> 14:18.317
But look, Poppy, I just sort of saw it.

14:18.400 --> 14:21.069
And I've been working on something
that I think is a perfect compromise,

14:21.153 --> 14:23.697
and it's gonna make us both very happy.

14:23.780 --> 14:24.740
I doubt it.

14:24.823 --> 14:25.991
Come on. Let's go.

14:26.575 --> 14:28.243
Physical contact, eye contact.

14:28.327 --> 14:30.954
-You're so obsessed with contact.
-Okay, that's 'cause I'm a human being.

14:31.038 --> 14:32.831
All right, now just focus up.

14:33.457 --> 14:35.375
-And stop here.
-Uh-huh.

14:35.459 --> 14:37.169
And open your eyes.

14:40.839 --> 14:42.090
You got rid of my desk?

14:42.174 --> 14:44.259
Yes. And no.

14:45.052 --> 14:46.053
Here, look.

14:46.970 --> 14:48.096
Let me show you.

14:50.849 --> 14:51.850
I call it…

14:53.936 --> 14:55.395
the efficiency pod.

14:56.021 --> 14:57.022
Pretty cool, huh?

14:57.105 --> 15:00.442
Imagine a world
where each individual employee

15:00.526 --> 15:04.154
is able to create
their own individual workspace,

15:04.238 --> 15:08.367
but in a contained way
that doesn't spill out into common areas.

15:10.619 --> 15:11.620
Right.

15:13.580 --> 15:16.083
-Pretty great, huh?
-Oh, my God.

15:16.667 --> 15:18.252
I mean, it's brilliant.

15:18.335 --> 15:20.045
-Yes!
-I'm impressed.

15:20.128 --> 15:25.384
I mean, look at this amazing,
brand-new thing you've come up with.

15:25.467 --> 15:28.971
Yes! Yes, I think it's going to
revolutionize the way that people work.

15:29.054 --> 15:32.182
Yeah. They should put this
in every office in America.

15:32.266 --> 15:33.767
Uh-huh.
That's exactly what I was thinking.

15:33.851 --> 15:34.685
I knew you would get it.

15:34.768 --> 15:35.978
-It just sort of came to me.
-Yeah.

15:36.061 --> 15:37.938
Love it.

15:38.021 --> 15:39.439
You've invented a cubicle.

15:42.276 --> 15:43.527
-No.
-Yeah.

15:43.610 --> 15:44.736
No, that's not what this is.

15:44.820 --> 15:46.697
But what does it do?

15:48.323 --> 15:49.741
Well, it's a workstation.

15:49.825 --> 15:50.826
And where is it?

15:52.494 --> 15:53.704
In the middle of an office.

15:53.787 --> 15:55.247
And what shape is it?

15:56.248 --> 15:57.875
-Cube.
-It's a cube.

15:57.958 --> 16:01.003
It's a cubicle. You invented a cubicle.

16:01.086 --> 16:03.755
Goddamn it. Damn it.

16:03.839 --> 16:06.842
A cubicle. It's an amazing, new idea.

16:06.925 --> 16:10.137
-Gather round, a genius at work!
-All right, stop making fun of me.

16:10.220 --> 16:13.098
But hey, relax.
It's one bad idea. It happens.

16:13.182 --> 16:16.101
-I don't have bad ideas, okay?
-Well, clearly you do. So…

16:16.185 --> 16:18.937
I feel like
I'm in a hostile work environment

16:19.021 --> 16:21.857
-and my--
-It's my fault? It's my fault now?

16:21.940 --> 16:24.193
I can't think straight
because my brain feels

16:24.276 --> 16:27.696
like it's a poached egg in a frying pan
and I'm all scrambled.

16:27.779 --> 16:30.032
That's like three different kinds
of egg preparations.

16:30.115 --> 16:31.116
I need some fresh air.

16:35.954 --> 16:37.331
Problem solved.

16:37.998 --> 16:39.833
-What is this?
-Your rat. We caught it.

16:39.917 --> 16:41.835
-Problem solved.
-No, not solved.

16:41.919 --> 16:43.754
-I asked you to take care of it.
-And we did.

16:43.837 --> 16:46.131
Not you. I wasn't talking to you.
I don't even know why you're here.

16:46.215 --> 16:48.217
I think you always knew
I was gonna get involved in this.

16:48.300 --> 16:49.343
I did not.

16:49.426 --> 16:51.303
Either way,
we outwitted this cunning animal

16:51.386 --> 16:53.931
and made a nice little nest
for the rat to have its babies in.

16:54.014 --> 16:55.349
See, I realized it was pregnant,

16:55.432 --> 16:57.851
which was why
it was stealing foam and not food.

16:57.935 --> 16:59.144
Problem solved.

16:59.228 --> 17:02.773
Stop saying that. I didn't want one rat.
Why would I want 50 rats?

17:02.856 --> 17:04.023
I thought you'd be pleased.

17:04.107 --> 17:05.858
Really? That's insane. Dana.

17:05.943 --> 17:07.694
Dana.

17:07.778 --> 17:08.945
Dana.

17:09.029 --> 17:10.239
Dana.

17:10.321 --> 17:12.074
-Dana.
-What?

17:12.156 --> 17:14.992
Can you tell them that it's insane
that they think I want 50 rats?

17:15.077 --> 17:16.662
I don't wanna be a part of this.

17:16.744 --> 17:18.914
-Would you kill a pregnant rat, Dana?
-No.

17:18.997 --> 17:20.082
It's not pregnant anymore.

17:20.165 --> 17:21.708
That's right. It's not pregnant.

17:21.791 --> 17:23.836
Dana, would you dispose of
these rats humanely?

17:23.919 --> 17:25.337
But, do make sure they're dead.

17:25.420 --> 17:27.422
Absolutely fucking not, David.

17:27.506 --> 17:29.341
Come on. I don't wanna deal with rats.

17:29.424 --> 17:30.759
-You feel me?
-David.

17:30.843 --> 17:32.845
Right. Only if you say it first.

17:33.929 --> 17:36.014
All right. I'll do it.

17:39.601 --> 17:40.853
I'm not gonna do it.

17:40.936 --> 17:43.188
Okay, well, enjoy your new pet rats.

17:43.939 --> 17:45.899
Problem solved.

17:45.983 --> 17:47.192
Not solved!

17:56.869 --> 17:58.829
How do you guys feel
about living in Cerritos?

18:06.587 --> 18:07.713
Fresh air, huh?

18:07.796 --> 18:11.675
Needed four hours of fresh air
'cause I made fun of your efficiency pod?

18:11.758 --> 18:12.801
Shut the fuck up.

18:17.681 --> 18:18.682
Okay.

18:20.184 --> 18:21.185
I--

18:22.227 --> 18:23.270
I turned the temperature down

18:23.353 --> 18:26.398
-if you wanna come and do some--
-Why are you trying to take my thing?

18:28.483 --> 18:29.484
What?

18:30.569 --> 18:32.779
I see it. You build it.

18:32.863 --> 18:36.867
That's the way it has always been,
and now you're trying to do both. Why?

18:38.869 --> 18:41.914
I don't know.
I didn't think of it like that.

18:41.997 --> 18:44.541
Bullshit. You fucking liar.

18:44.625 --> 18:48.086
You come in throwing your weight around.
You put up your Post-it notes.

18:48.170 --> 18:49.880
You make fun of me
with your "big idea" hands.

18:49.963 --> 18:53.967
-You know exactly what you're doing.
-What I'm doing is my job.

18:54.051 --> 18:55.344
You're doing my job.

18:55.427 --> 18:58.764
Well, maybe that's because
you're not around to fucking do it.

18:58.847 --> 19:00.849
-Oh, come on. Please.
-Yes.

19:00.933 --> 19:03.352
Yes, excuse me if I want
a little more control

19:03.435 --> 19:06.230
over an office
that you are barely ever in.

19:07.439 --> 19:09.358
You know,
every time I turn around, you're gone.

19:09.441 --> 19:11.276
You're in the metaverse.
You're off with Dana.

19:11.360 --> 19:13.612
You're doing fucking God knows what else.

19:13.695 --> 19:17.533
I've tried to help you.
Every single time I try, you kick me out.

19:17.616 --> 19:19.326
Yes, but I always kick you out.

19:21.703 --> 19:23.830
You never actually leave.

19:23.914 --> 19:25.374
What's changed, Ian?

19:25.457 --> 19:26.959
-I don't know.
-Yes, you do.

19:27.042 --> 19:28.752
-I don't know.
-Yes, you do!

19:28.836 --> 19:30.879
-I don't kn--
-You know!

19:32.047 --> 19:34.550
It's because this time it's my game.

19:36.635 --> 19:39.096
And you don't wanna work on my game,
do you?

19:49.648 --> 19:50.649
No.

19:57.489 --> 19:58.490
I knew it.

20:01.910 --> 20:03.161
I fucking knew it.

20:07.833 --> 20:09.877
Wait, Poppy.

20:09.960 --> 20:11.879
I tried. I promise.

20:13.630 --> 20:15.299
I really did. I--

20:19.094 --> 20:20.470
That's just like you, isn't it?

20:21.847 --> 20:24.558
Overpromise, under-deliver.

20:27.728 --> 20:29.062
-Come on, Po-- Come on.
-No.

20:55.797 --> 20:56.798
Fuck!

21:08.977 --> 21:10.229
Hey, Poppy.

21:11.230 --> 21:12.231
Where's Ian?

21:12.314 --> 21:13.815
Don't know. Don't care.

21:15.817 --> 21:17.110
Okay.

21:18.695 --> 21:21.657
Get back to work.
We've wasted enough time already.

21:27.246 --> 21:28.830
It's so quiet in here.
