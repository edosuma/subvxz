00:34.451 --> 00:35.618
You little motherfucker!

00:50.800 --> 00:52.969
Get up' Zack.

01:13.531 --> 01:16.007
Come on, I don't wanna be
late for work.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.335
Ahh! Get out!
- Jesus, fuck!

01:25.502 --> 01:27.545
Close the door
if you're gonna take a shit.

01:27.712 --> 01:30.340
- It was closed.
- It was closed over, it was not closed.

01:30.507 --> 01:32.217
- Close the door' Zack!
- Okay, okay.

01:32.383 --> 01:34.344
God.
- Fine.

01:52.946 --> 01:55.198
- What's that thing?
- It's a hand warmer.

02:05.041 --> 02:06.459
We're going now.

02:16.719 --> 02:20.598
- You smell that? Is that the car? Fuck.
- Oh, goddamn it.

02:20.765 --> 02:22.809
- What? What?
- Oh, it's wedged in my taint.

02:22.976 --> 02:24.727
- What is?
- It got wedged in my taint.

02:24.894 --> 02:27.730
- What?
- It's stuck under my balls.

02:28.231 --> 02:30.733
- It's between my balls and my leg.
- What's happening?

02:30.900 --> 02:35.238
- Please, pull over. Pull the fuck over!
- All right, all right! Jesus, all right!

02:35.405 --> 02:37.323
It's about to move up to my ass.
- What?

02:37.490 --> 02:39.075
The movement makes it hotter.

02:39.242 --> 02:42.203
It's tucked under them.
It's stuck under them.

02:53.006 --> 02:55.091
Oh' fuck.

03:07.604 --> 03:09.564
I think I burned my ball hair off.

03:13.568 --> 03:15.528
It's not funny.

03:30.126 --> 03:32.462
Can you help me pick out an outfit
for tonight?

03:32.629 --> 03:34.714
I'm working till 6.

03:37.175 --> 03:41.846
- Well' I can try stuff on at the store.
- The store?

03:42.013 --> 03:44.641
No, how about instead,
you get a friend?

03:44.807 --> 03:46.351
But you are my friend.

03:46.517 --> 03:49.812
I mean a girl friend, jeez.

04:30.770 --> 04:34.023
Mr. Delaney,
can you work for me tomorrow?

04:34.190 --> 04:35.275
Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.

04:35.441 --> 04:39.028
Then you must come in the next day,
I tell you.

04:39.195 --> 04:41.364
- It's Black Friday.
- Black Friday?

04:41.531 --> 04:44.492
It's the biggest mall-shopping day
of the year.

04:44.659 --> 04:49.497
And since the mall is just up the street,
I would like you to come out and work.

04:49.664 --> 04:52.041
- On Black Friday.
- Oh, yeah.

04:52.208 --> 04:54.627
All right, you want me to work
on Moolie Monday too?

04:54.794 --> 04:57.046
- I'm sorry?
- How about Nigga Tuesday?

04:57.213 --> 05:00.717
- Nigga Tuesday? Is this a new holiday?
- You come to a brother and tell him

05:00.883 --> 05:04.846
he gotta work on Black Friday. You
got any idea how racist that sounds?

05:05.013 --> 05:07.181
Telling me to work.
What, you think you own me?

05:07.348 --> 05:10.435
- I never said this, I tell you.
- But you thought it, didn't you?

05:10.601 --> 05:11.644
You thought,

05:11.811 --> 05:14.480
"I'm gonna lay down the law
for this nigga, I put food on his table,

05:14.647 --> 05:17.567
clothes on his nigga baby backs,
and he ain't gonna say shit."

05:17.734 --> 05:19.360
- This ain't Amistad.
- You shut up.

05:19.527 --> 05:22.822
You goddamn right this ain't Amistad.
I can't wait till the post office

05:22.989 --> 05:26.534
settles my disability suit because then
I'm gonna be out this motherfucker.

05:26.701 --> 05:28.953
I'm gonna be Oprah rich.
Y'all can kiss my ass.

05:29.120 --> 05:32.081
You know what? Fuck you.
Fuck you, and suck cock.

05:34.459 --> 05:36.377
- To hell with you.
- To hell with you.

05:36.544 --> 05:40.465
- Zachary will work. Zack' my boy.
- Yeah.

05:40.631 --> 05:43.134
- The customer with the harelip...
- Oh, yeah.

05:43.301 --> 05:48.097
- speak me, say you were playing
baseball here the other night.

05:48.264 --> 05:51.768
Wiffle ball.
And' uh' no' that wasn't me.

05:52.226 --> 05:54.771
Maybe the harelip
makes it sound like "baseball."

05:54.937 --> 05:56.606
Yeah, maybe you hear with an accent.

05:56.773 --> 05:58.608
- Fuck you, okay?
- Okay.

05:58.775 --> 06:02.278
One day' I'm gonna put a camera
over there' and then I can tell...

06:02.445 --> 06:04.405
I'll know everything you do
when I'm gone.

06:04.572 --> 06:07.992
Everything. Scratch your balls,
take a shit, everything, I tell you, okay?

06:08.159 --> 06:10.745
Okay. Fucker.

06:11.120 --> 06:16.793
I hate both of you ebony and ivory
motherfuckers, I tell you.

06:17.627 --> 06:23.257
- Why is he so fucking high-strung?
- "Fuck off, I tell you. Very good."

06:23.424 --> 06:26.636
Can you believe that Gandhi motherfucker,
telling me I gotta work on Black Friday?

06:26.803 --> 06:27.804
Ain't that some shit?

06:27.970 --> 06:29.847
- Yeah.
- Like I don't wanna do shopping.

06:30.014 --> 06:33.643
Biggest sales day of the year. I'm
getting a flat-screen TV, believe that.

06:33.810 --> 06:37.397
That's my fault, I should tell you. I
asked for Friday morning off, I'm sorry.

06:37.563 --> 06:40.525
- For what?
- I actually need a lot of recovery time.

06:40.691 --> 06:43.152
Tonight is me and Miri's
ten-year high school reunion.

06:43.319 --> 06:46.072
I'm just gonna
get fucking alcohol poisoning.

06:46.239 --> 06:49.867
- Reunion? Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.
- Isn't that fucked up that they do that?

06:50.034 --> 06:52.620
They say it's the best chance
to get everyone together.

06:52.787 --> 06:54.664
People come back in town
for the holidays.

06:54.831 --> 06:57.125
But they could have it
in the middle of the summer

06:57.291 --> 07:00.920
at a blowjob contest that I was judging'
and it would still be retarded.

07:01.587 --> 07:04.549
- So why you going, then?
- Miri's making me go.

07:04.715 --> 07:07.176
Why you always
bending over backwards for that girl'

07:07.343 --> 07:10.471
- knowing she ain't giving up no ass?
- We got a good thing going.

07:10.638 --> 07:14.016
She pays half the rent, does dishes,
she wakes me up in the morning.

07:14.183 --> 07:16.060
Why complicate that with sex?

07:16.227 --> 07:18.563
Besides, man, I've known her
since the first grade.

07:18.729 --> 07:21.023
You don't fuck someone
you met in the first grade.

07:21.190 --> 07:23.192
Excuse me,
I met my wife in kindergarten.

07:23.359 --> 07:24.694
We got married senior year,

07:24.861 --> 07:27.363
and she has been the queen
of my world ever since.

07:27.530 --> 07:31.033
- What if you could do it all over again?
- I'd jerk off and live by myself.

07:31.200 --> 07:32.994
That woman is the bane
of my existence.

07:33.161 --> 07:37.123
- See?
- Excuse me, can I get a coffee, black?

07:37.290 --> 07:39.834
Can't you see we talking, white?

07:42.378 --> 07:44.338
If you're gonna continue
to emasculate me

07:44.505 --> 07:46.883
with this Barbie dress-up shit'

07:47.049 --> 07:48.092
I'm using your laptop.

07:48.259 --> 07:50.678
Don't forget to smack it
when you turn it on,

07:50.845 --> 07:52.597
otherwise the screen
doesn't come on.

07:54.557 --> 07:56.309
Why don't you spring
and get a new one?

07:56.476 --> 07:59.312
Same reason I don't spring for clothes
for tonight, I'm broke.

07:59.479 --> 08:02.398
There's a chick who works
at Teen Juice at the mall, you know.

08:02.565 --> 08:04.066
I gave her a good deal on yarn,

08:04.233 --> 08:06.736
- so she's letting me borrow this stuff.
- Yo, bro.

08:08.738 --> 08:12.658
What?
- You're buying a vibrator online.

08:12.825 --> 08:15.495
- What's wrong with the one you have?
- It died last week.

08:15.661 --> 08:18.247
Look at the size
of those fucking panties.

08:18.414 --> 08:20.082
Shoot that shit. Shoot it.

08:20.249 --> 08:22.585
My God, who even knew
Amazon sold shit like this?

08:22.752 --> 08:24.003
This is incredible.

08:24.170 --> 08:27.256
- Those are fucking granny panties.
- Okay,

08:27.423 --> 08:30.968
A, I don't appreciate you violating the
sanctity of my Amazon Wish List page'

08:31.135 --> 08:33.221
and B, I'm not buying that thing
from Amazon,

08:33.386 --> 08:36.557
because it turns out
I don't have a credit card they take.

08:42.522 --> 08:46.275
- Oh, shit.
- I'm sorry, guys. Am I in the way?

08:46.651 --> 08:49.445
You're a fucking faggot, all right?
Let's go to Starbucks.

08:49.946 --> 08:53.950
- He's a shitty barista anyways.
- Cock.

08:56.285 --> 08:59.455
- And he throws like a bitch.
- You know what else I throw?

08:59.622 --> 09:02.375
My nut sack in your coffees,
so how did that taste, fucker?

09:02.542 --> 09:05.461
We saw your girlfriend
in her underwear, cunt nugget.

09:05.628 --> 09:08.923
Well' too bad she's not my girlfriend,
you little fuck... Oh, they're gone.

09:09.090 --> 09:10.758
Are you still talking to me?

09:10.925 --> 09:15.513
Uh, just said, I'm gonna
look up more fuck toys on Amazon.

09:16.138 --> 09:18.140
Oh' holy shit.

09:18.307 --> 09:21.394
- They sell the Fleshlight here too.
- What's that?

09:21.561 --> 09:24.313
It's a fucking pocket pussy
that is shaped like a flashlight

09:24.480 --> 09:25.982
"for discretionary jacking off."

09:26.148 --> 09:28.568
That way if you get caught,
no one thinks it's weird.

09:28.734 --> 09:31.320
You're just a guy who likes to fuck
his flashlight.

09:31.487 --> 09:33.114
I am totally buying this shit.

09:33.281 --> 09:36.826
Whoa, if you've got money to burn,
how about paying the electric bill?

09:36.993 --> 09:39.829
- That's due already?
- November's is probably due now,

09:39.996 --> 09:43.833
but I was talking about September's.
Tell me this doesn't rock.

09:45.918 --> 09:47.795
You kind of look
like Ronald McDonald.

09:47.962 --> 09:49.672
That makes me want
some McNuggets.

09:49.839 --> 09:53.217
Why would you wanna buy a
pocket pussy anyway? That is so sad.

09:53.384 --> 09:55.678
What? Excuse me,
I forgot about the nobility

09:55.845 --> 09:58.514
that accompanies coming
with a fucking vibrator.

09:58.681 --> 10:02.351
Think a kid in Darfur gets saved every
time a vibrator makes you come? No.

10:02.518 --> 10:04.437
- "Real feel action"? Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.772
If you start fucking machines,
I'm moving out.

10:06.939 --> 10:09.150
What do you think a vibrator is?
It's a machine.

10:09.317 --> 10:11.777
How come you get
to fuck something with a motor in it?

10:11.944 --> 10:14.864
I've never met a man who can
make me come like a vibrator does.

10:15.031 --> 10:18.367
That's bullshit. You get to be Buck
Rogers having sex in the 25th century

10:18.534 --> 10:20.453
with fucking Twiki and Dr. Theopolis.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.955
I'm stuck to a bottle of Jergens
in the bathroom.

10:23.122 --> 10:28.169
Holy bejesus. You do not use
my Jergens to jack it in our bathroom.

10:28.336 --> 10:31.213
No, you know what I do
actually, is I light a bunch of candles

10:31.380 --> 10:34.884
and I sprawl out on my sheets
and I listen to Sting.

10:35.051 --> 10:38.429
No, I'm a guy. Give me
two Popsicle sticks and a rubber band,

10:38.596 --> 10:41.557
I'll find a way to fuck it,
like a filthy MacGyver.

10:41.724 --> 10:46.020
Oh' my God, I'm so glad I'm not a guy.
How about this?

10:46.187 --> 10:49.065
I don't get why you're putting
so much effort into this thing.

10:49.231 --> 10:54.028
I thought we were just gonna go to
sit around and make fun of everybody.

10:54.195 --> 10:58.407
I can't wear anything that I already own
and expect to bring home Bobby Long.

10:58.574 --> 11:03.996
Bobby fucking Long? No way.
Didn't that guy call you "Stinky Linky"?

11:04.163 --> 11:05.373
Yeah, that was then, okay?

11:05.539 --> 11:08.209
Maybe now he can save me a fortune
in Amazon bills.

11:08.376 --> 11:11.420
Maybe you can fuck our landlord

11:11.587 --> 11:13.673
so we can at least keep a roof
over our heads.

11:14.340 --> 11:17.760
You don't have the rent?
Zack, it's your month.

11:17.927 --> 11:20.596
Hey, I bought skates
with last week's paycheck

11:20.763 --> 11:23.265
- and I need those to skate with.
- Oh.

11:23.432 --> 11:27.561
And this week's will barely cover
the past two water bills, so...

11:27.728 --> 11:29.313
Is this sexy?

11:29.480 --> 11:33.275
Yeah, in like a To Catch a Predator
kind of way' it is pretty fucking sexy.

11:34.443 --> 11:35.861
Then we're done.

11:37.613 --> 11:40.074
What the fuck? Zack.

11:40.533 --> 11:43.369
- You want me to come in?
- What happened to the water?

11:47.456 --> 11:50.459
- They shut it off.
- Oh, shit. Just, uh...

11:50.626 --> 11:54.505
Help me get this shit out of my hair.
Just use the water out of the toilet.

11:57.133 --> 11:59.135
- There's poo in there.
- Not that part.

11:59.301 --> 12:01.846
- The back part of the toilet thing.
- Oh, that makes sense.

12:02.012 --> 12:05.224
Take the cup there
and then scoop it in, there you go.

12:05.391 --> 12:09.270
Here, I'll lean back and you can just'
you know, pour it down like... Like that.

12:09.437 --> 12:11.021
You're harshing my buzz' you know.

12:11.188 --> 12:13.107
This is so lame.
Don't look. Don't look.

12:13.274 --> 12:14.817
Don't look.

12:15.151 --> 12:16.318
Whoa!

12:28.122 --> 12:30.458
All right, one hour tops,
then we're gone.

12:30.624 --> 12:31.667
Or I had an idea.

12:31.834 --> 12:34.295
We could just not go at all,
which would rock.

12:35.171 --> 12:38.174
Even though we're broke
and we've never amounted to anything,

12:38.340 --> 12:40.342
we're still better than these people,
right?

12:40.509 --> 12:45.055
No. Not at all. We're probably
not even as good as most of them,

12:45.222 --> 12:47.600
unless one of them is a crackhead
or something.

12:47.767 --> 12:50.561
Just tell me I'm prettier
than when we graduated.

12:51.353 --> 12:53.063
You look about the same.

12:53.230 --> 12:56.358
Definitely not prettier,
but around the same.

12:56.817 --> 12:58.527
I'm thinner, though' right?
A little?

12:59.612 --> 13:00.696
Not really.

13:01.947 --> 13:04.533
Well' good pep talk. Fuck.

13:15.211 --> 13:17.880
- Ta-da.
- Ta-da.

13:21.300 --> 13:24.178
- You don't recognize us' do you?
- Um, no, sorry.

13:24.345 --> 13:26.138
Zack Brown, Miri Linky.

13:26.555 --> 13:28.474
Were you the one they called
Stinky Linky?

13:28.641 --> 13:31.393
Oh' no' no one ever called me that.

13:31.602 --> 13:32.645
Oh.

13:32.812 --> 13:35.356
- Great. What does yours say?
- What the fuck? Come on.

13:35.523 --> 13:39.068
- I'm sure I had a nickname. Nothing?
- All right, you have a great time'

13:39.235 --> 13:43.531
and before you go, don't forget
your copy of The Roving Roe-Ver.

13:43.697 --> 13:45.241
What the fuck's this shit?

13:45.407 --> 13:48.410
That is not shit, that would be
our bi-monthly newsletter.

13:48.577 --> 13:49.995
- Awesome.
- It updates you

13:50.162 --> 13:52.832
- on what everyone's doing.
- Finally.

13:52.998 --> 13:56.877
I love your enthusiasm. Here you go.
Write your e-mail address on that

13:57.044 --> 14:00.840
and I'll be sure to add you
to our 800-member-strong mailing list.

14:01.006 --> 14:03.008
We had 800 people
in our graduating class?

14:03.175 --> 14:07.847
Yes, and only 250 R.S.V.P.'d.
Doesn't that suck, Mary?

14:08.347 --> 14:10.349
- Miri.
- You married, Bets?

14:10.516 --> 14:13.435
- I am. Two kids.
- Wow, that's beautiful.

14:13.602 --> 14:15.729
- Awesome.
- You wanna fuck me later?

14:15.896 --> 14:18.983
- Uh, no, I'm married.
- Okay, cool. If you change your mind,

14:19.149 --> 14:21.360
- I'll be in there getting shitfaced.
- He will.

14:21.527 --> 14:23.737
- Just so you know, I eat the pussy.
- He does.

14:23.904 --> 14:26.198
Ah, tempting. Again, no.

14:26.365 --> 14:29.618
- Shall we?
- Sir. Bye, Bets.

14:30.286 --> 14:32.288
Think about it.

15:18.626 --> 15:20.127
Enjoy.

15:21.337 --> 15:24.089
Can I get two beers' please?
You want a beer?

15:24.256 --> 15:26.508
- Yeah.
- Three beers.

15:27.009 --> 15:29.094
- Thank you.
- Here you go.

15:29.261 --> 15:35.309
Is that Zack? Or am I Zack?
Whoa, ho, ho.

15:35.559 --> 15:37.144
Oh' wow.

15:37.311 --> 15:39.813
- Never gets old, huh?
- The other Zack.

15:39.980 --> 15:43.525
Oh' in my world,
nobody calls me "the other Zack,"

15:43.692 --> 15:47.154
now that this guy's not around
anymore, huh?

15:47.321 --> 15:52.326
- Get the fuck off of me.
- There can be only one.

15:52.952 --> 15:56.163
- What?
- Highlander, man? The Kurgan.

15:56.330 --> 16:00.209
Remember? I'd yell it at you whenever
we passed each other in the hallway?

16:00.376 --> 16:03.003
Like it was yesterday' man.
Awesome. Awesome.

16:03.170 --> 16:06.840
Awesome. God, you guys have
so much to catch up on. Whoo.

16:07.007 --> 16:08.884
- No.
- I'm gonna let you get to it.

16:09.051 --> 16:10.552
Bitch.

16:15.224 --> 16:18.477
Have you seen that big blowup picture
they have of me?

16:18.644 --> 16:19.687
Yeah, it's...

16:20.562 --> 16:23.899
My hair is terrible. I can't believe
I even wore my hair like that.

16:24.066 --> 16:26.944
That's before I knew
about styling products' you know.

16:27.111 --> 16:31.657
It makes a big difference in life.
But you live and learn, though' right?

16:31.824 --> 16:36.412
I mean, ten years ago, Pittsburgh,
who knew anything about fashion?

16:37.246 --> 16:42.167
Back in the day' our hairstyle, oh...

16:43.627 --> 16:44.753
Hey, stranger.

16:46.255 --> 16:51.343
- Whoa. Stinky Linky.
- Yeah. Although it's just Miri now.

16:51.510 --> 16:53.721
- Give me a hug.
- Oh, okay.

16:53.887 --> 16:56.640
- Hi, heh, heh, heh.
- Hi.

16:56.807 --> 16:58.392
Wow.

16:58.934 --> 17:00.936
- How have you been?
- Great, great.

17:01.103 --> 17:02.604
- Yeah?
- You look fantastic.

17:02.771 --> 17:07.108
Wow, that is not something that you
would have said to me ten years ago.

17:07.276 --> 17:11.030
- Well' I've grown up.
- Yes. Yes, you have.

17:11.195 --> 17:13.824
You just look...

17:14.532 --> 17:17.118
Ooh, heh, heh.

17:17.286 --> 17:22.124
- Well' listen to you. Thank you.
- No, don't thank me, just fuck me.

17:36.013 --> 17:37.973
Roxanne. Hey.

17:38.140 --> 17:41.226
Someone I like, what are the odds'
huh?

17:43.645 --> 17:45.898
Zack Brown, we had four years
of Spanish together.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.399
Why does no one recognize me?

17:47.566 --> 17:49.985
- Am I thinner? Is that it?
- Look at him.

17:51.195 --> 17:53.614
- Who?
- My stupid husband.

17:53.781 --> 17:58.243
No fucking shit. John Butterfield?
You actually married John Butterfield?

17:58.410 --> 18:00.662
- That's amazing.
- Don't ever get married.

18:00.829 --> 18:04.541
It sucks. You stop appreciating each
other and run out of shit to talk about

18:04.708 --> 18:09.171
after the first year.
But look at him now, chatty as fuck.

18:09.338 --> 18:12.674
Flirting up a storm with that
cheerleader nimrod Monica Von.

18:13.509 --> 18:17.679
You want me to maybe flirt with you
so he can see it, even it up a bit?

18:17.846 --> 18:18.931
I don't wanna get even.

18:20.265 --> 18:23.393
If I was gonna do anything,
I'd wanna one-up the asshole.

18:25.145 --> 18:27.689
You can give me a handjob
in the girls' locker room.

18:32.820 --> 18:34.738
- Fine, but make it fast.
- Fuck, yeah.

18:34.905 --> 18:37.449
Are you staying in town
for a while or...?

18:37.616 --> 18:40.327
Just tonight. I fly back
to L.A. tomorrow.

18:40.661 --> 18:46.208
L.A., wow, Los Angeles. Gosh'
Bobby Long' coming up in the world.

18:46.708 --> 18:52.631
- With Mrs. Long, I bet, huh?
- No, no, no. No Mrs. Long for me.

18:53.090 --> 18:56.218
- Then can I be honest with you?
- Sure.

18:56.385 --> 18:57.719
Um...

19:00.139 --> 19:01.682
Whew. I think I need a drink.

19:01.849 --> 19:04.518
Do you need a drink?
Because I need a drink to say this.

19:04.685 --> 19:08.063
- I've got a beer already, so...
- Oh, great, thank you.

19:08.522 --> 19:10.816
I think there's a
cigarette butt in there.

19:10.983 --> 19:12.025
Yup.

19:15.946 --> 19:18.031
Sorry about the elbow.

19:21.577 --> 19:24.663
There can be only one.

19:26.707 --> 19:28.834
Can I get a beer, please?

19:30.669 --> 19:33.463
Thank you very much.

19:34.089 --> 19:36.842
Oh' Jesus Christ.

19:37.009 --> 19:40.262
My friend's making an ass of herself
hitting on her high school crush.

19:40.429 --> 19:42.306
Oh' God' that's so sad.

19:42.472 --> 19:45.267
It's so Miri, is what it is.
I'm Zack, by the way.

19:45.434 --> 19:47.186
Brandon.

19:48.770 --> 19:51.273
Don't worry, we weren't
in the same class or anything.

19:51.440 --> 19:55.694
- Okay. Lucky you.
- Are you a Monroe-ver?

19:55.861 --> 19:59.114
Well' I went here'
let's just leave it at that, I guess.

19:59.281 --> 20:02.326
Do you have one of the large
blown-up pictures of your younger self

20:02.492 --> 20:05.370
- hanging around here?
- I do, kind of. Right there.

20:08.081 --> 20:10.292
Gorgeous.
- Good times.

20:10.459 --> 20:12.794
What do you do?
What brings you here?

20:12.961 --> 20:15.047
I came with somebody
who went to school here.

20:15.214 --> 20:16.381
- Really?
- Bobby Long.

20:16.548 --> 20:19.801
No shit. That's who my friend's hitting
on right now. See right there?

20:19.968 --> 20:22.679
- Really.
- One dressed like Hannah Montana?

20:23.305 --> 20:26.141
In L.A., we call that look
"Nickelodeon chic."

20:26.308 --> 20:28.644
- Wait, L. A? Los Angeles?
- California.

20:28.810 --> 20:30.979
That's awesome, man.
What do you do out there?

20:31.146 --> 20:35.108
- I'm an actor.
- Wow, that's really impressive.

20:35.275 --> 20:37.653
- Thank you, thank you.
- In fucking movies?

20:37.819 --> 20:40.447
"Fucking movies." Pretty much.

20:40.614 --> 20:43.492
Look at you. What...?
Anything I've seen? What movies?

20:43.659 --> 20:45.661
Oh' all sorts of movies
with all-male casts.

20:45.827 --> 20:49.248
All-male casts.
Like Glengarry Glen Ross? Like that?

20:49.581 --> 20:53.210
Like Glen and Gary
Suck Ross' Meaty Cock

20:53.377 --> 20:56.838
and Drop Their Hairy Nuts
in His Eager Mouth.

20:58.840 --> 21:02.469
- Is that like a sequel?
- Sort of.

21:02.636 --> 21:06.181
- It's a re-imagining.
- Oh, like The Wiz.

21:06.348 --> 21:10.519
More erotic and with less women.

21:10.686 --> 21:13.188
No women' to be exact.

21:14.856 --> 21:19.528
I apologize in advance
if I am out of line here,

21:19.695 --> 21:21.530
but are you in gay porn?

21:21.697 --> 21:24.199
- Guilty as charged.
- Are you fucking with me?

21:24.366 --> 21:27.536
- I thought you recognized me, that's...
- Oh, okay, I get it.

21:27.703 --> 21:30.038
You're not in my demographic'
so I'm not insulted.

21:30.205 --> 21:33.542
- Not really. Who's your demographic?
- Do you love pussy?

21:33.709 --> 21:35.460
- I do.
- Then not you.

21:35.627 --> 21:36.795
Oh' okay.

21:36.962 --> 21:39.172
I came here tonight

21:39.339 --> 21:42.384
hoping to seduce you
and bring you back to my apartment

21:42.551 --> 21:45.554
and sleep with you to, uh,
get back at you,

21:45.721 --> 21:50.017
you know, for calling me Stinky Linky
all those years ago.

21:50.183 --> 21:51.226
Wow.

21:51.393 --> 21:53.520
That is a weird revenge plot.

21:53.687 --> 21:56.481
- You must be a terrible lay for that.
- What? No, I'm great.

21:56.648 --> 21:59.234
I mean, I've had enough practice
and everything. That...

21:59.401 --> 22:02.904
Wow, that sounded not good.

22:03.071 --> 22:08.076
I fuck a lot. That's what I meant to say.
That doesn't sound good either. Wow.

22:08.243 --> 22:10.996
You're a lot funnier than I remember.

22:11.663 --> 22:16.585
Thank you. Gosh,
you turned out to be such a nice guy.

22:18.253 --> 22:22.841
It just... You know' it makes it even
easier to just... To just say this.

22:23.008 --> 22:27.596
Would you like to come back to my
place and maybe open a bottle of wine

22:27.763 --> 22:31.099
and have ourselves
a real high school reunion?

22:31.808 --> 22:33.393
- I...
- Hello, Miriam.

22:33.560 --> 22:34.644
Beat it, we're talking.

22:34.811 --> 22:37.939
- I wanted to introduce you to Brandon.
- Salutations.

22:38.106 --> 22:40.275
- Bobby's boyfriend.
- Bobby who?

22:40.442 --> 22:43.236
- Bobby me.
- Bobby Long.

22:44.196 --> 22:50.118
Brandon is the star of such adult fare
as... What was that one called again?

22:50.786 --> 22:53.080
You Better Shut Your Mouth
or I'm Gonna Fuck It.

22:53.246 --> 22:56.291
That's right.
I'm surprised I forgot that.

22:56.541 --> 22:57.959
Are you fucking with me?

22:58.126 --> 23:00.462
No, they're fucking with each other.

23:00.879 --> 23:01.963
Oh' my God.

23:03.632 --> 23:05.634
- No.
- What?

23:06.927 --> 23:08.303
Granny Panties?

23:08.470 --> 23:10.138
- Excuse me?
- How can you tell?

23:10.555 --> 23:11.681
This is so crazy.

23:11.848 --> 23:14.935
I was literally just watching you, like,
right before we got here.

23:15.102 --> 23:17.979
This is so crazy. This is you, right?

23:18.146 --> 23:19.481
My name's Granny Panties,

23:19.648 --> 23:21.942
and nobody wants to fuck me.

23:22.109 --> 23:24.653
Nothing's whiter than my big gay ass...

23:24.820 --> 23:25.821
Where'd you get that?

23:25.987 --> 23:28.490
Oh' I entered "gay" and "ass,"
and it was the top hit.

23:28.657 --> 23:33.495
It's had 200,000 views in three hours.
Honey' you are, like...

23:33.662 --> 23:36.331
I'm jealous right now
because you're, like, super famous.

23:36.498 --> 23:40.001
Baby, please take our picture.
I get a picture with Granny Panties.

23:40.168 --> 23:42.337
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- This is awesome.

23:42.504 --> 23:45.215
- All right, smile. Okay' got it.
- Did you get it?

23:45.382 --> 23:47.634
- Oh, thank you very much.
- E-mail me that.

23:47.801 --> 23:50.345
Oh' because he's the worst
photographer. Okay' good.

23:50.512 --> 23:52.681
- You're gay?
- Yeah.

23:53.515 --> 23:56.810
And I'm on the Internet
wearing a diaper?

23:56.977 --> 23:59.688
Who knew you'd come to Pittsburgh
and meet a celebrity?

24:00.689 --> 24:02.649
I'm gonna binge-drink now
until I pass out.

24:02.816 --> 24:06.945
Okay. She'll be fine. So you guys
suck each other's cocks, huh?

24:07.112 --> 24:08.530
Oh' like crazy.

24:10.365 --> 24:12.576
Okay, that's enough, I think.

24:12.742 --> 24:14.744
I'm embarrassing him.
I love when he's embarrassed.

24:14.911 --> 24:17.372
He's not living out loud,
so he gets all like, ooh.

24:17.539 --> 24:20.625
- You are totally in love, aren't you?
- Zachary' we are.

24:20.792 --> 24:21.960
Wow, I...

24:22.127 --> 24:23.879
Oh' God' I just wanna eat him up,
yum, yum.

24:24.045 --> 24:25.797
Save some for me' yum, yum, yum.

24:25.964 --> 24:28.675
- I can't keep my hands off him.
- You've had one too many.

24:28.842 --> 24:32.512
Although he does most of the eating in
the sack. In the sack and of the sack.

24:32.929 --> 24:35.557
All right, that's enough.
Look, you've drunk too much.

24:35.724 --> 24:38.810
You do this every time. You get too
Mary for everybody in the room

24:38.977 --> 24:41.563
- and you can't contain yourself.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

24:41.730 --> 24:45.901
And by containing myself, do you
mean containing myself in a closet?

24:46.067 --> 24:48.737
In a closet of denial? Is that...?
No, no, no.

24:48.904 --> 24:50.655
Holy shit, this just got real.

24:50.822 --> 24:52.908
This is exactly why
you haven't met my mother.

24:53.074 --> 24:55.577
You don't know how to ease people
into this situation.

24:55.744 --> 24:59.706
- You just force your way in every time.
- I thought, maybe for one second

24:59.873 --> 25:03.126
in this godforsaken town,
I could be myself. I'm so sorry.

25:03.293 --> 25:05.420
No, you're right' I should just butch up

25:05.587 --> 25:10.842
and pretend that I don't love it when
you shove your dick in my mouth.

25:11.009 --> 25:14.095
- This is the best night of my life.
- Am I making a spectacle?

25:14.262 --> 25:16.723
- I could make a much bigger scene.
- You really are.

25:16.890 --> 25:20.227
I'm sorry. Pittsburgh.
Listen up' Monroe-vers.

25:20.393 --> 25:24.856
My name is Brandon St. Randy'
and I love Bobby Long.

25:25.023 --> 25:26.566
- Fucking A.
- Is that enough?

25:26.733 --> 25:29.611
Is that enough of a scene?
I could start doing worse than that.

25:29.778 --> 25:32.197
The reason you haven't taken me
to your mother's...

25:32.364 --> 25:35.951
Your mother with her makeup and
all her drinking, she's in the closet too.

25:36.117 --> 25:39.704
- They fight just like real people.
- I thought I'd be a conduit for you...

25:39.871 --> 25:40.956
Thank you.

25:41.122 --> 25:43.959
- Are you being sarcastic?
- No, I'm not.

25:44.626 --> 25:47.254
- Thank you.
- I love you.

25:48.129 --> 25:50.590
- I'll e-mail you.
- Zack, it was so nice to meet you.

25:50.757 --> 25:54.010
And I will be patient with you.
I will be there on your journey.

25:54.177 --> 25:57.931
I will be your Sherpa
up the mountain of gayness.

26:24.958 --> 26:29.879
Well' might as well see how many hits
Granny Panties is up to, huh?

26:33.717 --> 26:35.510
Did I do that?

26:43.101 --> 26:45.020
Thanks, George.

26:46.521 --> 26:49.899
What kind of evil fucks
turn off your power the day...?

26:50.066 --> 26:55.155
No, the night before Thanksgiving?
Who does that?

26:55.322 --> 26:56.990
Can you get an advance on your card?

26:57.157 --> 27:02.037
Fleshlight maxed-out my $200 limit.
Not a wise purchase, I'll give you that.

27:02.203 --> 27:06.207
This is bad. If we don't come up
with rent, we're gonna get locked out.

27:06.374 --> 27:09.127
Who the fuck wants to live there?
There's no water or power.

27:09.294 --> 27:12.714
Which means by the time
we get home, there's no heat either.

27:13.715 --> 27:17.469
Well' I think it's time we put what
we always talked about into effect.

27:18.136 --> 27:20.847
- You're gonna have to start hooking.
- You know, you jest,

27:21.014 --> 27:23.892
but these are the exact circumstances
people find themselves in

27:24.059 --> 27:26.478
right before
they start having sex for money.

27:26.645 --> 27:29.356
- Yeah.
- Or making porn.

27:43.328 --> 27:46.164
Oh, my God, yeah.
- What? You got an idea?

27:46.331 --> 27:47.749
We could make a porno.

27:48.166 --> 27:50.085
- Not the idea I was looking for.
- What?

27:50.251 --> 27:53.880
No, that is a fucking awesome idea.
Are you shitting me? That's a rad idea.

27:54.047 --> 27:57.967
That guy, Brandon St. Randy, who's
Bobby Long's awesome nice boyfriend,

27:58.134 --> 27:59.928
he said he makes
a hundred grand a year

28:00.095 --> 28:03.723
because he shoots and distributes
his own porno flicks.

28:03.890 --> 28:06.184
If it's so easy,
how come everybody doesn't do it?

28:06.351 --> 28:09.646
Because other people have options
and dignity, which we do not have,

28:09.813 --> 28:12.899
which puts us in an amazingly
advantageous position.

28:13.066 --> 28:14.567
Fuck you, I have dignity.

28:14.734 --> 28:16.945
Where? Is it hidden
in your gigantic underpants

28:17.112 --> 28:20.699
that are plastered all over the Internet?
Is that where you hide your dignity?

28:20.865 --> 28:24.786
Every woman has a pair of those
period panties. That's, like, a fact.

28:24.953 --> 28:25.954
Okay. Families.

28:26.121 --> 28:28.915
I bet people don't make porno,
because they have families.

28:29.082 --> 28:33.962
But luckily, your parents are dead.
Sorry. My grandparents are dead.

28:34.129 --> 28:35.839
- Sorry.
- Thank you.

28:36.005 --> 28:39.384
So who are we gonna disappoint?
Porn has gone mainstream now.

28:39.551 --> 28:44.097
It's like Coca-Cola or Pepsi with dicks
in it. Look at Paris Hilton.

28:44.264 --> 28:46.474
She throat-fucks a guy in night vision,

28:46.641 --> 28:48.893
now she's selling fragrances
to tweens.

28:49.060 --> 28:51.271
And I'm pretty sure
she's legally retarded.

28:51.438 --> 28:52.480
That's for tweens?

28:52.647 --> 28:55.400
Have you seen that Joe Francis guy
who made Girls Gone Wild?

28:55.567 --> 28:58.486
That guy is the biggest fucking idiot
piece of shit in the world

28:58.653 --> 29:00.822
and he has a jet and a fucking island.

29:00.989 --> 29:05.910
Look, there's got to be a less extreme
solution to our financial woes here.

29:06.077 --> 29:08.663
- Give me a better option.
- Get a paper route.

29:08.830 --> 29:10.623
- I don't have a bike.
- Be a waiter.

29:10.790 --> 29:14.461
No one wants me around their food.
Would you eat food that I gave you?

29:14.627 --> 29:17.005
I would not eat food that you gave me,
that's true.

29:17.172 --> 29:19.507
I mean, nobody
wants to see us fuck, Zack.

29:19.674 --> 29:23.303
Everybody wants to see
anybody fuck. I hate Rosie O'Donnell,

29:23.470 --> 29:27.015
but if someone said' "I got a tape of
Rosie O'Donnell getting fucked stupid,"

29:27.182 --> 29:29.851
I'd be like, "Why aren't we
watching that right now?"

29:30.018 --> 29:31.311
Because she's famous. Hello.

29:31.478 --> 29:33.563
So are you.
You're fucking Granny Panties.

29:33.730 --> 29:37.192
My underwear and your ass
are famous' we're not.

29:37.358 --> 29:39.861
So who the F
would wanna watch us fuck?

29:40.028 --> 29:42.781
- At least 800 people.
- The jerks we went to school with?

29:42.947 --> 29:44.657
- Are you serious?
- Of course.

29:44.824 --> 29:46.785
If you heard
that someone we graduated with

29:46.951 --> 29:49.370
was in a fucking porno movie,
you'd watch it, right?

29:49.537 --> 29:52.040
I'd watch that guy Brandon
suck a cock, I just met him.

29:52.207 --> 29:54.793
With this mailing list,
we have almost a thousand people

29:54.959 --> 29:57.754
that would definitely buy a porno
we were in just to be like,

29:57.921 --> 30:01.216
"Hey, I sat next to that guy in Civics.
Look at his fucking dick."

30:01.382 --> 30:05.887
We sell a thousand copies at 20 bucks
a pop, bam' we have paid off our bills.

30:06.930 --> 30:10.892
So' what do you think?
- I don't think I wanna fuck a stranger.

30:11.059 --> 30:13.561
Oh' wow,
like you've never done that before.

30:13.728 --> 30:17.190
How many guys have you met in a bar,
taken home,

30:17.357 --> 30:21.027
banged with your mouth
and then never talked to again?

30:21.194 --> 30:22.695
That's what we call a stranger.

30:22.862 --> 30:26.908
Dude, I don't one-night mouth-fuck
anybody that I pick up in bars.

30:27.075 --> 30:32.121
You don't wanna fuck a stranger in the
porno movie for some weird reason.

30:32.497 --> 30:33.581
I guess...

30:36.709 --> 30:37.752
We could fuck.

30:38.795 --> 30:40.755
- Ew.
- Fuck you.

30:40.922 --> 30:44.092
I mean, you're a nice-enough-looking
guy and everything...

30:44.259 --> 30:47.136
Holy fuck, thank you.
You're an all-right-enough-looking girl.

30:47.303 --> 30:49.430
- How does that feel?
- Dude' I'm just saying

30:49.597 --> 30:52.308
it'd be weird and wrong, you know,
like fucking my brother.

30:52.475 --> 30:55.228
Okay, seriously,
we're just talking about sex, okay?

30:55.395 --> 30:59.774
It's for a purpose. It's for getting rich.
Only my dick and your pussy

30:59.941 --> 31:03.778
would be doing something weird.
Our bodies and brains would be acting.

31:04.320 --> 31:07.282
- Wow.
- Just explain to your private beforehand,

31:07.448 --> 31:10.618
"Look' this doesn't mean anything.
We're just doing this for cash."

31:11.286 --> 31:13.621
- Oh, my God.
- What?

31:13.788 --> 31:17.584
You're just doing this because you've
always wanted to fuck me, aren't you?

31:18.334 --> 31:23.464
Yes. I've gone my whole life pretending
that I want nothing to do with you,

31:23.631 --> 31:26.926
just hoping one day
we'd be in such dire financial straits

31:27.093 --> 31:30.638
that I could use it
to finally make my move on you.

31:34.225 --> 31:36.477
You're just being sarcastic.
- I am.

31:36.644 --> 31:39.314
See' I was pretending to cry
right there.

31:40.315 --> 31:43.318
I guess it's not like it'd be creepy,

31:43.484 --> 31:47.405
like if we got way too drunk one night
and accidentally fucked, you know?

31:47.572 --> 31:52.160
No. We'd be going in
with the understanding that it's...

31:52.327 --> 31:53.661
A business decision.

31:53.828 --> 31:56.414
Strictly a business decision.
It's a means to an end.

31:56.581 --> 31:57.999
- Right.
- And by end,

31:58.166 --> 32:00.335
I mean, I'll be waxing your ass.

32:00.501 --> 32:03.504
Fuck you.
I'm not even letting you see my ass.

32:03.671 --> 32:07.508
I've seen your ass and the rest of you
naked around a billion times already.

32:07.675 --> 32:10.345
- That goes both ways, buddy.
- You've never seen my dick.

32:10.511 --> 32:12.847
Have you seen my dick?
You've never seen my dick.

32:13.014 --> 32:16.059
Are you kidding? That party we went to
where you got blasted,

32:16.225 --> 32:18.353
and Houls dared you
to give yourself head,

32:18.519 --> 32:20.813
and we all watched you try for,
like, an hour.

32:20.980 --> 32:25.777
Oh' yeah. Thanks by the way, for
fucking letting me do that. Thank you.

32:25.944 --> 32:28.363
Oh' God. We really do know too much
about each other.

32:28.529 --> 32:32.158
See' and this would really
just be one more thing.

32:32.325 --> 32:36.162
I mean, look at us. It's Thanksgiving
and we're huddled around a flaming

32:36.329 --> 32:38.706
fucking garbage can
like a couple of steno bums.

32:38.873 --> 32:42.877
I mean, this could give us a chance
to pay off our debt, pay our bills,

32:43.044 --> 32:46.965
get a fucking nicer apartment
with heat in it maybe.

32:49.801 --> 32:51.469
What are you doing?

32:53.054 --> 32:58.142
Miriam Linky, will you have sex
with me on camera for money?

33:05.358 --> 33:07.110
I will.

33:08.069 --> 33:09.404
A producer?
- Yeah.

33:09.570 --> 33:13.533
- Guy who gets to finance the movie.
- You think I got that kind of money?

33:13.700 --> 33:16.703
We just need that. What you're about
to spend on the flat screen.

33:16.869 --> 33:18.913
Now I can't get my flat screen?
Fuck that.

33:19.080 --> 33:23.001
No, no, no. With your cut of the profits,
you're gonna get two flat screens.

33:23.167 --> 33:25.420
One in your living room,
one in your bathroom.

33:25.586 --> 33:27.380
One in the bathroom?

33:27.964 --> 33:30.883
You know, it's always been my dream
to watch shit while I shit.

33:31.050 --> 33:33.678
Everyone with an ass
loves to watch shit while they shit.

33:33.845 --> 33:36.931
- I'm gonna make that happen for you.
- I don't know, man.

33:37.098 --> 33:38.558
What else the producer do?

33:38.808 --> 33:42.603
- Um, they help with the casting.
- What's casting?

33:42.770 --> 33:44.605
Finding the people to be in the movie.

33:44.772 --> 33:46.566
- I get to help pick the women?
- Yeah.

33:46.733 --> 33:50.111
Like, I can look at a titty, make sure
there ain't no moles on there?

33:50.278 --> 33:53.072
- You can look at both titties, man.
- Man.

33:53.239 --> 33:57.076
I've been looking at the same busted
titties for the past almost 20 years.

33:57.243 --> 34:01.789
- I'm due for another new titty.
- Please help us. Please.

34:01.956 --> 34:03.708
Please.

34:06.294 --> 34:08.795
Yes. Yes. I love you.

34:11.674 --> 34:13.384
Well' don't mind that smell.

34:13.551 --> 34:16.387
We had some homeless people
squatting in here.

34:16.554 --> 34:19.806
You know, they'd void their bowels
everywhere but the bathroom.

34:19.974 --> 34:24.645
Anyway, you pick up the poop
and you've got yourself a movie studio.

34:24.812 --> 34:26.522
Why don't we shoot
in your apartment?

34:26.688 --> 34:28.858
No power.
You wanna pay our electric bill?

34:29.025 --> 34:31.944
- You motherfuckers...
- We'll take it.

34:34.822 --> 34:37.116
Bring it back.
- Fuck, fuck, fuck.

34:38.493 --> 34:41.496
Oh' Jesus. Oh' Jesus.

34:41.661 --> 34:44.748
Oh' God. Come on.

34:45.500 --> 34:49.587
Why the fuck do I have to
do everything? Fuckers.

34:52.130 --> 34:54.467
Hey, what is that?

34:55.176 --> 34:59.847
Fucking guys. This fucking
team, man. They fucking suck.

35:01.265 --> 35:04.185
I'm gonna hatefuck
the shit out of you, ref.

35:04.352 --> 35:06.687
- Dude.
- It's cool.

35:06.854 --> 35:08.689
- He's my cousin.
- Hey.

35:09.607 --> 35:13.194
Didn't you used to videotape the varsity
basketball games in high school?

35:13.569 --> 35:17.365
Just the away games. I did it because
I was trying to fuck a cheerleader.

35:17.532 --> 35:18.533
Which one?

35:18.699 --> 35:22.578
Whichever one wanted to fuck the guy
who taped the varsity games.

35:22.870 --> 35:25.540
- Aw.
- Still know how to work a camera?

35:25.706 --> 35:28.793
- Who cares what the title is?
- The porn I liked when I was a kid,

35:28.960 --> 35:31.629
it was always, like,
a spoof of a popular movie, you know?

35:31.796 --> 35:34.340
Like, um, Edward Penishands.

35:34.507 --> 35:38.386
Okay, so we need a mildly clever,
vaguely dirty title,

35:38.553 --> 35:40.138
that sounds like a real movie

35:40.304 --> 35:42.890
- and sums up what you're gonna see.
- Correct.

35:43.057 --> 35:45.184
An American Werewolf in Brenda?

35:45.351 --> 35:47.061
Fuckback Mountain?

35:48.229 --> 35:51.399
- Too soon? A Cock-in-Lips Now?
- Next.

35:51.566 --> 35:53.693
Cradle the balls. Work the shaft.

35:53.860 --> 35:56.863
Jerk my come-crayon
and let me color you white.

35:57.029 --> 35:59.407
I need cock and I need it now.

35:59.574 --> 36:01.075
I'm fucking you in the puss.

36:01.242 --> 36:03.411
I'm fucking you in the puss.

36:03.578 --> 36:05.746
It's "puss" as in pussy.

36:06.289 --> 36:10.209
Oh' because I was like'
who would wanna fuck puss?

36:10.376 --> 36:16.591
I want to slam my ham in your can,
woman. Scene.

36:16.757 --> 36:20.469
- This guy is amazing.
- This guy's great-looking too.

36:20.636 --> 36:21.929
I wanna fuck him.

36:22.096 --> 36:26.225
Hi, my name's Delaney
and I'm a producer.

36:26.392 --> 36:29.437
I really don't know what it means. I'm
gonna be honest' this is my first time.

36:29.604 --> 36:33.774
You don't have to worry, I'm not gonna
touch you or nothing like that.

36:33.941 --> 36:37.069
- All right.
- I have a wife, you know.

36:37.236 --> 36:41.699
We're happy. I mean, not happy'
but it's cool, you know.

36:42.408 --> 36:46.120
Just so you know,
there will be some fucking.

36:46.370 --> 36:50.041
- We'll talk about that if you get the part.
- Okay.

36:50.208 --> 36:53.336
I mean, not... We won't be fucking,
there'll be fucking in the movie.

36:53.502 --> 36:56.297
Like I said' I got a wife.
She don't play that shit.

36:56.464 --> 36:58.966
- She is a crazy bitch.
- Yep.

36:59.133 --> 37:03.763
It's my job as the producer
to see what you got.

37:04.222 --> 37:07.141
So if that makes you uncomfortable
in any way,

37:07.308 --> 37:13.397
you don't have to show me anything
you don't wanna show me, because...

37:14.774 --> 37:16.484
I love the movies.

37:16.651 --> 37:18.736
- Lawrence of a Labia.
- No.

37:18.903 --> 37:21.072
- Oh, come on.
- Dawn of the Dick.

37:21.239 --> 37:24.075
Yeah, but how are zombies doing it
at all sexy?

37:24.242 --> 37:27.036
I want to eat your brain

37:27.203 --> 37:29.288
and your ass.

37:30.790 --> 37:32.750
- Dude.
- Sci-fi.

37:32.917 --> 37:36.671
Yeah. Close Encounters
With a Turd From Behind.

37:36.837 --> 37:39.006
- I don't know what that means.
- Just asses.

37:39.173 --> 37:41.175
Fucking deep in asses.

37:45.137 --> 37:46.180
What?

37:46.347 --> 37:48.391
We're making a porno
and we just need to know

37:48.557 --> 37:51.936
what you would be or would not be
interested in doing.

37:52.103 --> 37:53.354
If anything.

37:54.188 --> 37:56.607
- No anal.
- Oh, definitely no anal.

37:56.774 --> 37:58.526
Anal and hugging.

37:58.693 --> 38:00.027
I don't do ass stuff.

38:00.194 --> 38:02.613
- Anal.
- Ah, fuck.

38:02.780 --> 38:06.033
- Oh, wait, oral. I like anal.
- Yay.

38:06.200 --> 38:09.537
Okay, well,
so, uh, do you have any special skills?

38:09.704 --> 38:11.330
Special skills?

38:12.873 --> 38:15.543
I can get a boner really quick
and it sticks straight up.

38:15.710 --> 38:17.712
- Is that really a special skill?
- I think.

38:17.878 --> 38:20.673
- Can you show us what you mean?
- Sure.

38:28.639 --> 38:30.016
Oh' that is special.

38:31.726 --> 38:32.935
Yeah, you're hired, Mr...

38:33.102 --> 38:34.895
- Who are you again?
- Lester.

38:35.062 --> 38:37.565
Lester "The Molester" Cockinshtuff.

38:37.732 --> 38:38.733
- No.
- Wow.

38:38.899 --> 38:41.902
That is the best porn name
I've ever heard' man.

38:42.069 --> 38:43.404
I can have a porn name?

38:44.238 --> 38:48.075
- Then I'll be Pete Jones.
- Okay.

38:48.492 --> 38:49.910
Are you Granny Panties?

38:50.077 --> 38:52.079
- She is.
- Get the fuck out of here.

38:52.246 --> 38:53.831
The panties
are actually in the house.

38:53.998 --> 38:55.041
- I'll get them.
- Whoa.

38:55.207 --> 38:58.753
The Wrath of Cunt.
- We never made a Star Sex 1.

38:58.919 --> 39:01.589
I guess we can lose Star Sex 3:
The Search for Cock, then.

39:01.756 --> 39:03.591
- Cocunt.
- What's that?

39:03.758 --> 39:05.384
It's Cocoon with a cunt.

39:07.094 --> 39:11.265
So Delaney tells us
you have a special talent of some sort.

39:11.432 --> 39:13.934
I don't know if I'd
call it a special talent,

39:14.101 --> 39:17.605
but it's a little something I picked up
doing bachelor parties.

39:17.772 --> 39:20.524
It would probably be easier
if I just showed you.

39:21.150 --> 39:22.943
- Great.
- The floor is yours.

39:38.793 --> 39:41.712
So a movie, huh? That could be fun.

39:52.056 --> 39:54.058
Holy fuck.

39:58.646 --> 40:00.815
Her name's Bubbles.

40:01.440 --> 40:04.860
- Invasion of the Potty-Snatchers?
- That's like MAD Magazine stupid.

40:05.027 --> 40:08.989
Well' fuck you' okay? You try to think
of a good sci-fi porno title. It's hard.

40:09.156 --> 40:12.159
There's gotta be one we haven't
thought of that would say it all'

40:12.326 --> 40:14.328
not be ridiculously filthy
and off-putting,

40:14.495 --> 40:17.665
and still have instant recognition
with our audience.

40:19.291 --> 40:20.418
- I got it.
- I got it.

40:21.335 --> 40:24.213
- Star Whores.
- Yeah. It's funny' right?

40:24.380 --> 40:27.299
See' we figured this opens us up
to an even bigger sales market

40:27.466 --> 40:29.510
beyond the people we went
to school with.

40:29.677 --> 40:31.429
People who like comics and sci-fi.

40:31.595 --> 40:33.347
Comics? Like "Ziggy"?

40:33.514 --> 40:36.684
"Ziggy"? Is that even in fucking papers
anymore? No, man.

40:36.851 --> 40:39.812
Fuck you. "Ziggy" is a comic'
right next to "Family Circus."

40:39.979 --> 40:42.356
No, like Spider-Man and shit,
you know?

40:42.731 --> 40:46.110
There's always a shitload of Star Wars
nerds at those comic-book shows.

40:46.277 --> 40:49.738
So we sell them a Princess Leia
they can really fucking jerk off to.

40:49.905 --> 40:53.993
- That'd be me, Princess Lay-Her.
- Who am I playing?

40:54.160 --> 40:57.621
You' my friend,
are the lead role of Lubed Guy-Baller.

40:57.788 --> 40:59.373
Man' he's gonna be balling dudes?

40:59.540 --> 41:01.584
I thought you said
this was boys on girls.

41:01.750 --> 41:04.420
If I have to fuck a guy' okay,
but I'd rather fuck a girl.

41:04.587 --> 41:06.297
What's wrong with you, boy?

41:06.464 --> 41:09.842
- We'll change the name to Sky-Baller.
- Sky-Baller.

41:10.009 --> 41:12.052
I will be Hung So-low.

41:12.219 --> 41:15.973
Delaney, my friend,
you are On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over.

41:16.140 --> 41:18.476
Man' I can't be in no porno.
My wife will kill me.

41:18.642 --> 41:22.021
Hump me, On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over.
You're my only hump.

41:22.188 --> 41:24.064
On the other hand, fuck my wife.

41:24.231 --> 41:27.526
Unfortunately, On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over
does not have any sex in the movie

41:27.693 --> 41:32.490
but the droids do,
l-CUP and R2-T-Bag.

41:32.656 --> 41:35.075
I robot.

41:35.242 --> 41:40.080
And Stacey over here
is gonna play Darth Vibrator.

41:40.247 --> 41:42.500
- I'm the bad guy?
- She's not a guy, Zack.

41:42.666 --> 41:44.960
I know that
because I'm not a fucking idiot.

41:45.127 --> 41:48.672
In our movie,
Darth Vibrator is a bad girl

41:48.839 --> 41:50.341
who wants to fuck the galaxy,

41:50.508 --> 41:54.887
literally' and it's up to Lubed and Hung
to stop her with their cocks.

41:55.054 --> 41:57.097
- You and me get to have sex, then?
- Yeah.

41:57.264 --> 41:59.892
- Cool.
- I know. Isn't that awesome?

42:00.059 --> 42:03.729
Hold up, hold up. So who's all having
sex with who in this movie?

42:03.896 --> 42:05.981
As of last night,
I was having sex with Zack.

42:06.148 --> 42:11.195
What? Han Solo ain't never had no sex
with Princess Leia in the Star Wars.

42:11.362 --> 42:13.822
Guys' this isn't
a literal adaptation here.

42:13.989 --> 42:17.117
It's more of an erotic re-imagining.

42:17.284 --> 42:20.871
Kind of like The Wiz or like a parody.
With lots of anal.

42:21.038 --> 42:23.707
- Cool.
- I know, isn't that awesome?

42:24.208 --> 42:28.295
I have a question, do Princess Lay-Her
and Lubed Sky-Baller have sex?

42:29.630 --> 42:32.591
Uh, no, because
they're brother and sister,

42:32.758 --> 42:35.427
and according to Miri'
brothers and sisters can't fuck.

42:35.594 --> 42:38.013
But you said,
that this wasn't a literal translation,

42:38.180 --> 42:42.101
so that means Lester's character
could have sex with Miri's character.

42:42.268 --> 42:46.397
Because I would love to fucking eat
her ass and fuck her silly in the movie.

42:46.564 --> 42:48.983
Dream on, pal,
it's never gonna happen, okay?

42:49.149 --> 42:51.986
- No, I'm fine with it.
- See' she's fine... Wait, what?

42:52.152 --> 42:55.239
Yep. I mean, everyone else is having
sex with more than one person

42:55.406 --> 42:57.157
in this movie all of a sudden,

42:57.324 --> 43:02.621
so I think it's' you know'
not fair if I'm only fucking you.

43:03.289 --> 43:06.292
Guys, read amongst yourselves, okay?
Can I talk to you for a sec?

43:06.917 --> 43:08.752
Look, Miri,

43:08.919 --> 43:12.339
we got plenty of sex going on in this
thing, you don't have to do that.

43:12.506 --> 43:16.093
Zack, it's fine. I mean I have slept with
way worse-looking guys than Lester.

43:16.260 --> 43:18.929
I just wanna do my part for the movie
like everyone else.

43:19.096 --> 43:22.224
You're having sex in the movie,
you don't need to fuck someone else.

43:22.391 --> 43:24.685
- You're good.
- I'm only fucking you' though.

43:24.852 --> 43:28.689
So don't we need to vary it up
to keep it fair?

43:28.856 --> 43:31.150
Fair for...? I don't... What?
Fair for who?

43:31.317 --> 43:33.694
What are these,
blood diamonds we're talking about?

43:33.861 --> 43:37.281
Fair for everyone else
who is fucking more than one person,

43:37.448 --> 43:39.366
a.k.a. you' in the movie.

43:39.533 --> 43:42.703
- I mean, fine...
- All right. I mean, if you don't care...

43:42.870 --> 43:45.789
I don't fucking care if you fuck him.
Fuck. I don't give a shit.

43:45.956 --> 43:48.959
Like you said, you know,
you've fucked bigger idiots than Lester.

43:49.126 --> 43:53.547
Holy shit. Are we really gonna
shoot this in outer space?

43:53.714 --> 43:55.215
Maybe not bigger idiots.

44:42.971 --> 44:44.431
Thank you.

45:09.498 --> 45:14.128
- Cut. All right, guys, that's it.
- Yeah.

45:14.294 --> 45:17.965
Make sure you leave your costume
so we know they're here for tomorrow.

45:18.132 --> 45:22.010
Mostly, everybody, thank you so much
for helping us get ready' you know.

45:22.177 --> 45:26.223
Cleaning this place out, building the
sets, sewing the costumes, it's just...

45:26.390 --> 45:28.225
I mean, it's really amazing. Thank you.

45:28.392 --> 45:29.727
Seriously, thanks.

45:29.893 --> 45:34.314
But this is just the beginning, guys.
If Star Whores works, and it will'

45:34.481 --> 45:37.901
we are set up for sequels galore.
The Empire Strikes Ass.

45:38.068 --> 45:40.779
- Return of the Brown-Eye.
- The Phantom Man-Ass.

45:40.946 --> 45:44.450
And Revenge of the Shit:
The All-Anal Final Chapter.

45:46.577 --> 45:48.954
- Okay.
- Revenge of the Shit.

45:49.538 --> 45:52.332
- You got it?
- Yeah, no, we got it.

45:52.666 --> 45:53.709
Ew.

45:53.876 --> 45:56.378
- Fuck you, motherfuckers.
- We'll talk about that one.

45:56.545 --> 45:58.964
We're gonna have a lot of fun'
but more importantly,

45:59.131 --> 46:01.008
we're gonna make
a lot of fucking money' okay?

46:01.175 --> 46:03.177
- Yeah.
- So get ready for greatness, people.

46:03.343 --> 46:05.012
Tomorrow we start
principal photography.

46:05.179 --> 46:07.347
- Whoo!
- Yeah.

46:07.681 --> 46:10.017
- All right, good night, you guys.
- We got a movie.

46:14.146 --> 46:16.023
- What?
- Nothing.

46:16.190 --> 46:19.902
I think someone should acknowledge
how insane and amazing this is

46:20.068 --> 46:23.322
- and it's all because of you.
- I don't know. It's just a porno.

46:23.489 --> 46:27.451
You know what I mean.
You've really come into your own.

46:28.702 --> 46:29.953
Shut the fuck up.

46:31.163 --> 46:35.209
So speaking of coming into things'
ready for tomorrow? Twenty years'

46:35.375 --> 46:38.212
we're finally gonna know what it's like
to have sex with each other.

46:38.378 --> 46:39.880
You say that like
you've been wondering

46:40.047 --> 46:42.174
what it'd be like to sleep with me
for a while now.

46:42.341 --> 46:44.968
Why the fuck do you think
I started hanging out with you?

46:45.135 --> 46:49.139
I knew it. Here, help.

46:52.726 --> 46:57.022
Let's just promise that it's not gonna
change anything between us, okay?

46:57.189 --> 46:58.232
- Like what?
- I don't know.

46:58.398 --> 47:00.567
Some guys
can't keep sex in perspective.

47:00.734 --> 47:03.445
If anyone's gotta keep this
in perspective, it's you, okay?

47:03.612 --> 47:06.573
I don't want you getting all mushy
and gooey on me

47:06.740 --> 47:09.243
after I give you the best orgasm
you've ever had.

47:09.409 --> 47:11.787
Oh' like you know what you're doing
down there at all.

47:11.954 --> 47:14.832
I actually don't. Where's the clitoris?
Is it in your ass?

47:14.998 --> 47:17.751
Just, you know,
make sure you kind of whoop it up

47:17.918 --> 47:22.256
and act like I'm a stud who knows
what he's doing' okay? Just be a pal.

47:22.422 --> 47:26.218
Oh' dude, I am gonna Meryl Streep the
fuck out of this tomorrow, you watch.

47:28.804 --> 47:32.015
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

47:32.182 --> 47:34.434
No. Really, thank you.

47:36.436 --> 47:38.397
For everything.

47:40.107 --> 47:42.067
You're welcome.

47:48.115 --> 47:50.826
Less than 12 hours
and we make Monroeville history.

47:50.993 --> 47:55.706
- I really hope nothing goes wrong.
- It's a movie. What could go wrong?

48:04.506 --> 48:06.717
What are you doing?

48:08.635 --> 48:10.804
What's up?
- What the fuck?

48:10.971 --> 48:12.306
What are you doing?

48:12.472 --> 48:14.474
- What are you doing?
- Wait, wait.

48:14.641 --> 48:16.602
- Wait.
- Stop. Stop.

48:17.811 --> 48:20.981
- No, no, no.
- What the fuck is going on?

48:21.148 --> 48:24.234
Condos is what's going on,
as soon as this shit-hole's demo'd.

48:24.401 --> 48:25.861
No, you gotta stop it right now.

48:26.028 --> 48:28.405
We rented this place for a month
from Mr. Jenkins.

48:28.572 --> 48:30.782
Sounds like your Mr. Jenkins
was full of shit.

48:30.949 --> 48:33.410
Luxury Homesteads
bought this place a month ago.

48:33.577 --> 48:35.287
I'm gonna kill that lying old fuck.

48:35.454 --> 48:37.956
You're gonna have to go Florida,
that's where he moved.

48:38.123 --> 48:40.334
We've got thousands of dollars
of equipment in there.

48:40.500 --> 48:43.128
- Please.
- If you wanna sift through this rubble

48:43.295 --> 48:47.215
when we're done, be my guest.
Hey, get that fucking beam down.

49:04.566 --> 49:06.818
This is the last thing you wanna hear.

49:06.985 --> 49:08.362
If you don't get an advance,

49:08.528 --> 49:10.989
I don't think we're gonna keep
a roof over our heads.

49:11.156 --> 49:14.868
I got an advance already.
It went into all the costumes.

49:15.035 --> 49:17.871
- So all our money's gone?
- All your money?

49:18.038 --> 49:21.541
Never mind what my wife's gonna do
when there ain't no new snow tires,

49:21.708 --> 49:24.628
or when she sees
I charged a video camera.

49:24.795 --> 49:26.672
I'm sorry I dragged you into this' man.

49:26.838 --> 49:28.715
I just wanted to see some free titties.

49:29.383 --> 49:35.222
That's all. But there's no such thing
as free titties' is there, Zack?

49:36.306 --> 49:38.517
- Is there?
- Fuck this noise.

49:38.684 --> 49:41.395
Why don't we get another camera,
and shoot something else?

49:41.561 --> 49:43.981
Where are we gonna do that?
Got another sound stage?

49:44.147 --> 49:48.193
Sound stage? We had a shit-covered
garage we turned into a sound stage.

49:48.360 --> 49:51.029
We find someplace new
and we do it again.

49:52.406 --> 49:53.824
How? Okay, I'm broke, man.

49:53.991 --> 49:58.495
No, make that' I was broke.
Now I am really tapped out.

49:58.662 --> 50:01.081
I have to get another job
to pay Delaney back.

50:01.248 --> 50:04.751
So please tell me,
how can I afford to start over?

50:04.918 --> 50:07.087
- What can I get you?
- Yeah, can I get a, uh...?

50:07.254 --> 50:10.590
Too fucking late. Cappuccino, 3.50.

50:10.757 --> 50:12.759
I don't know
what the fuck I was thinking.

50:12.926 --> 50:18.098
I mean, I'm a total loser
in every single other aspect of my life.

50:18.265 --> 50:20.142
What made me think
I could do something

50:20.308 --> 50:22.102
as simple as filming people fucking?

50:22.269 --> 50:25.105
We have no money left,
nowhere to shoot, no sets,

50:25.272 --> 50:27.524
we have no fucking cameras. Here.

50:29.067 --> 50:31.903
It's time I go back to my regular life

50:32.070 --> 50:36.116
where I am a quiet fuckup
who doesn't cost anybody any money

50:36.283 --> 50:39.369
and knows his goddamn position
behind this fucking counter

50:39.536 --> 50:42.664
making cappuccinos
for this fucking guy.

50:47.002 --> 50:50.297
Oh' yeah. Oh, yeah.

50:55.802 --> 50:57.471
What are you doing?

50:59.222 --> 51:00.640
Oh' yeah.

51:01.266 --> 51:03.185
Yeah.

51:08.607 --> 51:10.442
Fuck, yes.

51:12.986 --> 51:13.987
Zack.

51:36.051 --> 51:40.931
You sneaky Indian motherfucker.
I tell you, yes.

51:42.140 --> 51:45.185
Swallow My Cockuccino.

51:45.352 --> 51:48.021
- What?
- That's it. That's the movie.

51:48.188 --> 51:51.733
Why didn't I think of it before?
We don't need sets or a stage.

51:51.900 --> 51:55.487
Look at all this production value,
waiting to have balls on it.

51:55.654 --> 51:58.365
Hold up. You wanna shoot
a dirty movie here, where we work?

51:58.532 --> 51:59.533
Yes.

51:59.699 --> 52:03.203
Fuck, yes, I do. You know how many
stories I have from working here?

52:03.370 --> 52:07.332
How many times I've been laid
right there after hours?

52:07.499 --> 52:09.126
You've never gotten laid here
after hours.

52:09.292 --> 52:11.378
I know. Thank you for reminding me.

52:11.545 --> 52:16.508
But I always wish I had,
and that's what porno is. It's fantasy.

52:16.675 --> 52:22.013
It's taking the normal
and making it abnormal by fucking it.

52:22.180 --> 52:24.558
Don't do that.
The little dog don't like that.

52:24.724 --> 52:26.184
How did you get a camera?

52:26.351 --> 52:30.230
By being a terrible, untrustworthy
employee, that's how.

52:30.897 --> 52:35.569
Give me today, I'll bang out a script.
Meet me back here after closing.

52:35.735 --> 52:40.907
We're gonna launch arching ropes of
jism all over this motherfucker. Peace.

52:42.701 --> 52:46.538
I like that guy but if he tries
to fuck that little dog tonight for real,

52:46.705 --> 52:48.874
I'm calling the Humane Society.

52:51.084 --> 52:55.005
It's called Bean-N-Gone,
so get the fuck out of here. Hey, Barry.

53:00.760 --> 53:03.847
Stand by, Stace' picture's up.
- Okay.

53:04.014 --> 53:05.891
Roll tape.

53:08.727 --> 53:11.771
Swallow My Cockuccino,
Scene 12, Take 1.

53:19.696 --> 53:21.823
And action.

53:29.956 --> 53:33.585
I'd like a double espresso
so I can stay up all night

53:33.752 --> 53:36.296
because I'm in the mood to fuck.

53:36.463 --> 53:40.967
Well' I am a whore-ista, so I love
to fuck. Would you like to fuck me?

53:41.134 --> 53:45.138
Holy fuck. You mean,
after you're done with your shift?

53:45.305 --> 53:48.266
I mean during my shift.

53:49.142 --> 53:51.436
- Sorry.
- Keep going, keep going.

53:51.603 --> 53:53.980
With your shaft.

54:04.282 --> 54:08.036
Let us fuck.

54:12.040 --> 54:13.833
Cue music.

54:19.631 --> 54:22.008
Okay, open up to camera,
guys. Let us see it.

54:25.512 --> 54:26.680
More tongue.

54:29.808 --> 54:31.268
Little less tongue.

54:35.605 --> 54:37.524
Oh' that was good.

54:43.280 --> 54:44.364
Cue effects.

55:01.715 --> 55:04.092
Oh' yeah, like that.

55:04.259 --> 55:06.386
Oh' yeah.

55:07.554 --> 55:10.598
See' I told you it would work.
Didn't I tell you? It looks amazing.

55:10.765 --> 55:12.309
It's incredible.

55:12.892 --> 55:15.562
Oh' the beans hurt. Easy.

55:15.854 --> 55:18.732
- Move in for coverage.
- Nice.

55:19.065 --> 55:20.150
That's why we got him.

55:20.317 --> 55:23.570
- Nice. I'm impressed.
- Get in there, Deacon.

55:23.737 --> 55:27.073
- Come on.
- Like that? Like that.

55:27.240 --> 55:30.869
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah. Look at that.

55:31.036 --> 55:32.912
- Pull out a bit, actually.
- That's hot.

55:33.079 --> 55:34.998
No, not you, Lester. Put it back in.

55:35.165 --> 55:36.666
Kiss the muscle.

55:37.250 --> 55:39.252
- I kiss the muscle.
- You kiss the muscle.

55:39.919 --> 55:43.006
- Can he slap her ass a little?
- Don't be a fucking pervert, dude.

55:43.173 --> 55:47.093
- Stir, come on. Stir.
- Yeah, stir it.

55:47.510 --> 55:50.221
Stir it, baby.

55:59.022 --> 56:00.190
Hey.

56:01.566 --> 56:03.026
- Holy.
- Shit.

56:03.193 --> 56:05.403
Are you guys still open?

56:06.946 --> 56:10.909
No. We close at 9.

56:11.743 --> 56:13.953
I need coffee so I'm drive home.

56:14.412 --> 56:17.540
- Okay. Yeah.
- Thank you.

56:18.875 --> 56:21.044
That's a cute kitty.

56:21.711 --> 56:22.879
Okay.

56:30.136 --> 56:31.137
Hey.

56:31.304 --> 56:32.972
- Hey.
- Hey.

56:33.139 --> 56:36.935
You guys see the game? I was at it.

56:37.102 --> 56:42.482
Fucking Roethlisberger,
the quarterback, was all fucking'

56:42.649 --> 56:48.405
"Hug it' chug it, football. All night."
Heh-heh.

56:48.571 --> 56:50.907
Okay, pal' here you go.
On the house.

56:51.241 --> 56:53.451
- I love you.
- I love you too. Have a good one.

56:53.618 --> 56:56.871
- Yeah, I'll have a cold one.
- I said, have a good one.

56:57.789 --> 56:58.832
Oh.

56:58.998 --> 57:01.751
- Okay. Keep moving.
- You and your little dog.

57:02.627 --> 57:04.796
Go Steelers.

57:10.677 --> 57:11.928
Action.

57:12.429 --> 57:16.474
Oh' yeah. Yeah, yeah, like that.

57:16.641 --> 57:21.521
Oh' fuck it' chuck it' football.
Oh' yeah.

57:21.855 --> 57:23.189
Oh' God' this is good.

57:25.859 --> 57:32.157
You take it. You take it.
Take it, Barry. Oh, take it.

57:32.323 --> 57:35.326
Take it, Barry. Take it.

57:36.161 --> 57:39.539
I'm disturbed
at how turned on I am by this.

57:40.623 --> 57:42.250
- Shit, dude' it's almost 6.
- Oh, fuck.

57:42.417 --> 57:44.544
Okay, that's a wrap,
everybody, yeah.

57:44.711 --> 57:47.714
Let's give a hand to our hotties
with the bodies from last night.

57:47.881 --> 57:50.383
Stacey, Lester,
Bubbles, Barry' whoo.

57:50.550 --> 57:51.634
Yeah.
- Nice.

57:51.801 --> 57:53.595
Okay, when we come back tonight,

57:53.761 --> 57:57.599
we finish up the venti-vulva scene' and
then we get into me and Miri's stuff.

57:57.765 --> 58:01.478
Again' amazing first night, everybody.
Thank you so much.

58:04.564 --> 58:06.774
Let us fuck.

58:09.944 --> 58:12.280
- Hey' how'd it look?
- How do you think it looked?

58:12.447 --> 58:15.909
It looked like shit going
into other shit, in focus.

58:16.075 --> 58:19.704
What an artist. That was Kurosawa's
motto. "Shit going into other shit."

58:19.871 --> 58:22.040
Oh' man,
I can't believe you gotta work now.

58:22.207 --> 58:25.001
It's okay. You know, honestly,
I don't think I could sleep.

58:25.168 --> 58:28.505
- I'm pretty, like, pumped up right now.
- Right? It was amazing.

58:28.671 --> 58:30.882
It was awesome.
I think the cast and crew had a good time.

58:31.049 --> 58:33.259
- We were getting great shit.
- Yeah, it was so fun.

58:33.426 --> 58:35.887
I just wanna keep shooting
people boning all day.

58:36.262 --> 58:39.432
I don't think I've ever met
the ambitious Zack Brown before.

58:40.099 --> 58:43.394
- Well' I'm trying to pay the bills, so...
- It's not a bad thing.

58:44.604 --> 58:46.773
I think it looks good on you.

59:33.570 --> 59:37.949
Come on, hurry.
Come on, come on' come on.

59:39.033 --> 59:40.159
Wait a minute.

59:40.326 --> 59:42.745
- You guys never did it before?
- It's fine.

59:43.204 --> 59:48.376
You know, we talked about it
and it's just for the movie.

59:48.543 --> 59:50.545
We're friends' you know'
we're just friends.

59:50.712 --> 59:54.591
And we will always just be
just friends, so...

59:54.757 --> 59:58.136
Listen' I have some extra lube
from last night.

59:58.303 --> 01:00:01.681
I understand it's kind of hard getting
wet when everyone's watching.

01:00:01.848 --> 01:00:03.683
At least it was for Barry.

01:00:03.850 --> 01:00:06.811
- I don't know if I am gonna need it.
- Really?

01:00:06.978 --> 01:00:10.440
Yeah, I think I'm just excited.

01:00:10.690 --> 01:00:11.941
Uh-huh.

01:00:12.609 --> 01:00:15.194
At the idea of people watching'
not because of Zack.

01:00:15.361 --> 01:00:18.489
Oh' God. Zack could never have that
effect on me in a million years.

01:00:18.656 --> 01:00:21.200
- Hello, Miriam.
- Oh, hey.

01:00:21.367 --> 01:00:22.410
Wow.

01:00:22.577 --> 01:00:24.370
- Your face.
- Yeah. Weird, huh?

01:00:24.537 --> 01:00:26.956
I don't think I've seen your face
since senior year.

01:00:27.123 --> 01:00:28.291
I think I made a mistake.

01:00:28.458 --> 01:00:31.377
I did it for you so you wouldn't
get road rash during our scene,

01:00:31.544 --> 01:00:34.714
but I should have asked first'
I look like a fucking beluga whale.

01:00:35.131 --> 01:00:37.717
I think I'll be going now.

01:00:39.135 --> 01:00:40.803
Okay.

01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:49.937
All I keep thinking is
we should've done a trial run

01:00:50.104 --> 01:00:51.564
at home last week or something.

01:00:51.731 --> 01:00:53.524
- Oh, my God. Right?
- I know.

01:00:55.735 --> 01:01:01.074
- You're still cool to do it, though, right?
- Yeah, um. Totally. Are you?

01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:03.368
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know, I'm, uh...

01:01:03.743 --> 01:01:06.204
- Honestly, I'm a little nervous, I guess.
- You are?

01:01:06.371 --> 01:01:08.665
- It's kind of a big deal.
- It is?

01:01:08.831 --> 01:01:12.752
Yeah, you know,
it's our first time together

01:01:14.170 --> 01:01:18.424
since our auspicious debut
on viral video.

01:01:19.592 --> 01:01:20.677
Oh' yeah.

01:01:20.843 --> 01:01:23.096
That's a fuckload of pressure
for a director.

01:01:23.596 --> 01:01:27.100
As a director, please. What about
the anxiety I'm feeling as an actress?

01:01:27.266 --> 01:01:30.603
- Did I pick the right project?
- Yeah. What about this follow-up?

01:01:30.770 --> 01:01:33.773
Julia Roberts followed Pretty Waman
with Sleeping With the Enemy.

01:01:33.940 --> 01:01:36.901
I'm following Granny Panties
with Swallow My Cockuccino.

01:01:37.068 --> 01:01:39.320
Only difference is
this movie's about cock-sucking

01:01:39.487 --> 01:01:41.572
and her movie just sucked cock,
period.

01:01:41.739 --> 01:01:44.784
- The only difference, yeah.
- The end was pretty rad.

01:01:45.410 --> 01:01:47.286
I liked that.

01:01:48.830 --> 01:01:51.374
- When she kills him.
- With a gun.

01:01:51.541 --> 01:01:52.667
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:01:52.834 --> 01:01:55.253
- She calls the cops first.
- She calls it in first.

01:01:55.420 --> 01:01:57.296
- It was so awesome.
- Awesome, yeah.

01:01:59.549 --> 01:02:01.801
So I guess we should do this.

01:02:01.968 --> 01:02:06.389
I think we should probably wait just
until I lose another 20 or 30 pounds.

01:02:06.556 --> 01:02:09.475
Stop it. You look good.

01:02:09.642 --> 01:02:11.144
Thanks.

01:02:12.812 --> 01:02:16.566
So, what about me? How do I look?

01:02:17.775 --> 01:02:21.446
I mean, you look beautiful.
You always look so beautiful,

01:02:21.612 --> 01:02:25.825
so I guess it's not a big deal,
but you look amazing.

01:02:34.250 --> 01:02:38.004
- Okay. Let's go make a porno.
- Okay.

01:02:39.130 --> 01:02:43.009
Swallow My Cockuccino,
Scene 8, Take 1.

01:02:43.176 --> 01:02:45.636
Come here.
- I'm over...?

01:02:46.304 --> 01:02:48.181
All right, settle.

01:02:48.931 --> 01:02:50.349
Action.

01:02:51.976 --> 01:02:54.353
Who could it be?

01:03:01.569 --> 01:03:02.737
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:03:02.904 --> 01:03:06.365
I'm a delivery man
and I have some cream for you.

01:03:06.532 --> 01:03:10.036
Wow, that cream looks heavy.
You must be strong.

01:03:10.203 --> 01:03:11.662
I work out.

01:03:11.829 --> 01:03:16.042
So do you want me
to give you your cream now?

01:03:16.209 --> 01:03:19.962
I've been waiting for it all day.

01:03:21.047 --> 01:03:22.048
- Fuck. Come on.
- Oops.

01:03:22.215 --> 01:03:23.800
Keep going.

01:03:23.966 --> 01:03:28.387
I spilled my cream. Do you mind?

01:03:28.554 --> 01:03:33.893
I don't mind.
Especially if you spill it on my face.

01:03:34.352 --> 01:03:36.395
Let us fuck.

01:03:42.652 --> 01:03:44.737
- Fix my shirt. Think I should?
- Okay.

01:03:44.904 --> 01:03:47.990
Let me see them titties.

01:03:48.407 --> 01:03:51.494
Actually, you know what? Sorry,
I don't think we should show them.

01:03:51.661 --> 01:03:53.955
- What?
- We shouldn't show your breasts.

01:03:54.121 --> 01:03:57.208
- Aren't you gonna take your shirt off?
- I'm just gonna open it.

01:03:57.375 --> 01:03:59.126
You're not gonna take it off? Why not?

01:03:59.293 --> 01:04:02.255
My tits are bigger than yours.
I don't wanna show that.

01:04:02.421 --> 01:04:05.383
She's not gonna show her tits?
I showed my cock and my asshole.

01:04:05.550 --> 01:04:07.885
- Okay, I'll do your pants.
- Back and forth. okay.

01:04:08.052 --> 01:04:10.429
- Holy shit.
- Where's that delivery?

01:04:10.596 --> 01:04:15.893
I can't believe this. I was delivering
cream, and look what's happening.

01:04:16.060 --> 01:04:19.856
- Jesus, what is that, a rumba?
- What's a rumba?

01:04:20.022 --> 01:04:21.941
That awkward movement.

01:04:23.609 --> 01:04:26.612
- Should I take your underpants off?
- Yeah, take them off.

01:04:29.615 --> 01:04:31.075
What the fuck?
How does this work?

01:04:31.242 --> 01:04:33.160
They're just like... I'll do it.

01:04:33.327 --> 01:04:36.289
- I'll do mine, you just... You do yours.
- I'll do my pants.

01:04:45.172 --> 01:04:47.425
Granny panties.

01:04:49.302 --> 01:04:51.137
Just get on with it already.

01:04:52.430 --> 01:04:54.307
I'm gonna fuck you with my pecker.

01:04:54.473 --> 01:04:56.267
Dude, that's really dirty.

01:04:56.434 --> 01:04:58.436
- That's too dirty?
- That offends me.

01:04:58.603 --> 01:05:00.479
- Penis?
- Fine.

01:05:00.646 --> 01:05:03.816
- I'm gonna fuck you with my penis.
- I can't wait.

01:05:03.983 --> 01:05:05.818
For my penis.

01:05:05.985 --> 01:05:09.447
Be careful, Miri. Okay, there we go.
Just keep rolling, keep rolling.

01:05:09.614 --> 01:05:14.285
- I'll walk forward.
- Fucking cream is coming.

01:05:16.913 --> 01:05:19.999
This is the worst porno
I've ever seen.

01:05:20.374 --> 01:05:26.005
Get over here, delivery man.
- Let's fuck on these beans.

01:05:28.174 --> 01:05:29.216
- You okay?
- Yup.

01:05:29.383 --> 01:05:32.720
Okay' all right.
- Just leave them. Just leave them.

01:05:32.887 --> 01:05:35.348
- They're really distracting.
- You should leave them.

01:05:35.514 --> 01:05:37.808
- You gotta get your... There you go.
- Okay' okay.

01:05:37.975 --> 01:05:40.269
- Okay, okay.
- Okay. This okay?

01:05:44.273 --> 01:05:45.858
Okay.

01:05:46.025 --> 01:05:47.443
Okay, uh.

01:05:47.860 --> 01:05:50.696
- We'll start kissing on three' okay?
- Okay.

01:05:50.863 --> 01:05:54.450
One, two, three. Go.

01:06:18.057 --> 01:06:19.976
I'm ready.

01:06:20.893 --> 01:06:24.397
- I'm ready.
- Okay.

01:06:33.531 --> 01:06:34.573
Deacon.

01:06:34.740 --> 01:06:36.993
- Deacon. Deacon.
- What?

01:06:37.159 --> 01:06:40.579
Did you see Lost this week, man?
I missed it. What happened?

01:06:40.746 --> 01:06:43.666
They're on the island, off the island.
Who can follow that?

01:06:43.833 --> 01:06:44.959
I think they're in hell.

01:06:45.126 --> 01:06:46.919
Would you all shut the motherfuck up?

01:07:01.934 --> 01:07:03.561
I want you to come.

01:07:03.728 --> 01:07:06.689
- I want you to come with me.
- Okay.

01:07:11.610 --> 01:07:13.821
Oh' God.

01:07:29.378 --> 01:07:31.464
Oh' God.

01:07:44.226 --> 01:07:45.394
Cut.

01:07:45.561 --> 01:07:50.316
That's it? It's over? Ain't he
supposed to come on her titties?

01:07:55.404 --> 01:07:58.032
Well' it wasn't what we'd shot-listed'
but that was nice.

01:07:58.199 --> 01:08:00.826
- It was so romantic.
- Way to fuck, Zack.

01:08:00.993 --> 01:08:03.204
Thanks, Lester, uh.

01:08:03.412 --> 01:08:07.083
It wasn't just me, though, guys. Give
it up for my radiant costar here, Miri.

01:08:08.459 --> 01:08:10.628
Nice.
- Um, show's over in here.

01:08:10.795 --> 01:08:12.880
Let's move out'
start lighting the next scene.

01:08:13.047 --> 01:08:14.799
- All right.
- Let's do it.

01:08:15.633 --> 01:08:17.551
You looked so beautiful.
- Thanks.

01:08:17.718 --> 01:08:19.636
I thought they were gonna
be fucking hard.

01:08:19.804 --> 01:08:21.471
- It was pretty.
- Pretty don't sell.

01:08:21.639 --> 01:08:23.682
- Good job.
- Thanks.

01:08:24.183 --> 01:08:26.935
You good, Mir? You need anything?

01:08:27.103 --> 01:08:29.020
I'm just gonna take a minute, okay?

01:08:29.188 --> 01:08:32.524
Okay, uh. I'll just be out there.

01:08:33.359 --> 01:08:34.859
Yeah.

01:08:36.403 --> 01:08:39.948
- That was fun.
- Yeah, fun.

01:08:41.826 --> 01:08:44.286
"Fun." You fucking douche.

01:09:10.062 --> 01:09:11.397
Wow.

01:09:26.912 --> 01:09:28.413
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:09:28.581 --> 01:09:31.417
- You working on a rewrite?
- Yeah, just for tonight's scene.

01:09:31.584 --> 01:09:34.170
- I'm ready to go when you are, though.
- Okay.

01:09:35.921 --> 01:09:42.761
You know, before we go, I...
I'm thinking that, uh, it's a good idea

01:09:43.345 --> 01:09:45.264
if we talk about
what happened last night.

01:09:47.015 --> 01:09:49.727
- Oh.
- I mean, we don't have to' but I think...

01:09:49.894 --> 01:09:51.060
Okay, yeah, uh.

01:09:51.228 --> 01:09:53.229
I kind of dropped the ball on that,
I guess, huh?

01:09:53.397 --> 01:09:57.276
- No, no. It's...
- To be honest, it was...

01:09:57.443 --> 01:10:00.029
You know, I didn't realize
how weird it would be for me.

01:10:00.196 --> 01:10:02.948
Weird? Like... Weird how?

01:10:03.574 --> 01:10:07.203
Acting and directing at the same time.
It's a lot to process, you know.

01:10:07.369 --> 01:10:11.123
For the first time' I thought my balls
didn't have enough hair on them.

01:10:11.290 --> 01:10:12.791
That's not what I meant.

01:10:14.585 --> 01:10:16.629
I know what you meant.

01:10:16.795 --> 01:10:18.464
How you feeling about it?

01:10:19.131 --> 01:10:21.050
I guess, um...

01:10:22.551 --> 01:10:23.719
I feel like...

01:10:25.471 --> 01:10:26.472
Like we...

01:10:28.098 --> 01:10:31.435
- Holy fuck.
- The power's on. Did you do this?

01:10:31.602 --> 01:10:33.604
How did this happen?
I burned the bills.

01:10:33.771 --> 01:10:35.231
How could we have done that?

01:10:35.397 --> 01:10:36.982
- The water.
- The water.

01:10:37.775 --> 01:10:40.236
Come on, come on' come on.

01:10:40.402 --> 01:10:41.737
Yeah!

01:10:41.904 --> 01:10:44.615
- We can shower in our home again.
- We are liquid.

01:10:50.496 --> 01:10:51.497
Greetings.

01:10:51.664 --> 01:10:55.000
Have you heard the good news about
our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ?

01:10:55.167 --> 01:10:56.835
Oh' my God, did you guys do this?

01:10:57.002 --> 01:10:59.838
We got tired of you taking showers
at our places all the time.

01:11:00.005 --> 01:11:02.132
So we took up a collection
amongst ourselves.

01:11:02.299 --> 01:11:04.176
And chipped away
at your mountain of debt.

01:11:04.343 --> 01:11:06.470
You guys paid off
our massive utilities bills?

01:11:06.637 --> 01:11:09.682
- How did you afford that?
- I stole my old lady's bingo winnings.

01:11:09.848 --> 01:11:12.226
And Mistress Bubbles
did a bachelor party tonight

01:11:12.393 --> 01:11:15.646
at which yours truly was a guest star,
thank you very much.

01:11:15.813 --> 01:11:16.939
- Oh.
- Whoa.

01:11:17.106 --> 01:11:20.859
Don't get too excited. We didn't pay off
your whole bill. Just a month of each.

01:11:21.026 --> 01:11:22.945
They agreed
to turn everything back on?

01:11:23.112 --> 01:11:24.822
At 9 at night? How does that work?

01:11:24.989 --> 01:11:27.741
Stacey knows somebody
that works at Power and Light.

01:11:27.908 --> 01:11:29.868
- You guys...
- This is amazing.

01:11:30.035 --> 01:11:31.537
You didn't have to do this.

01:11:31.704 --> 01:11:33.539
You didn't have to put us
in your movie.

01:11:33.706 --> 01:11:35.582
- Or let us shoot it.
- Or produce it.

01:11:35.749 --> 01:11:38.377
- Or put us in your movie either.
- We said that already.

01:11:38.544 --> 01:11:40.713
Guys, honestly,
I don't know what to say.

01:11:40.879 --> 01:11:43.007
You can start by saying
we can take tonight off

01:11:43.173 --> 01:11:45.384
so we can have our wrap party
right now.

01:11:45.551 --> 01:11:48.721
Guys, we're not wrapped.
We still have four days of shooting left.

01:11:48.887 --> 01:11:51.557
Excuse me.
In my "producorial" capacity,

01:11:51.724 --> 01:11:55.477
I'm shutting the movie down for a night
so we can get a little silly.

01:12:38.312 --> 01:12:40.606
Go' go' go.

01:12:40.773 --> 01:12:42.816
- Yes.
- Yes.

01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:45.652
You all drink.

01:12:45.819 --> 01:12:49.281
Was it just amazing with him,
after all those years of not knowing?

01:12:49.448 --> 01:12:52.659
It was, um, weird.

01:12:53.577 --> 01:12:55.913
- But good.
- My scene with Zack's tomorrow.

01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:57.456
You don't say.

01:12:57.623 --> 01:13:02.294
But I'm a little nervous. I was thinking
about trying to get with him tonight.

01:13:02.461 --> 01:13:05.005
- Really?
- I mean, if you don't mind.

01:13:05.172 --> 01:13:08.384
You are just friends and all'
so I didn't think it would be a biggie.

01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:10.803
- It wouldn't be a biggie, would it?
- No.

01:13:11.762 --> 01:13:15.766
No, no. It's not a biggie. What? No.

01:13:15.933 --> 01:13:17.476
Are you sure?

01:13:17.643 --> 01:13:20.312
Yeah. Stacey'
I'm not married to the guy, so...

01:13:20.479 --> 01:13:25.484
I don't know. You guys just looked
kind of intimate last night.

01:13:25.651 --> 01:13:28.153
- We did?
- Yeah.

01:13:32.449 --> 01:13:38.497
Well' we're just better actors than
I thought, I think, so you know what?

01:13:38.664 --> 01:13:41.834
If you wanna get with him'
you should just go ask him.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:45.754
- He'd be really excited to hear that.
- Yeah? For real, you don't mind?

01:13:45.921 --> 01:13:48.966
- Yeah.
- Cool.

01:13:53.220 --> 01:13:56.140
All the quarters are on the ground.

01:13:56.849 --> 01:13:59.643
Hey, Stace.
- Hey' Zack.

01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:07.609
Come on,
are you guys playing or what?

01:15:48.460 --> 01:15:50.963
Well' I'm bummed, but I totally get it.

01:15:51.129 --> 01:15:54.341
It's no problem to work
with Lester again. He has a nice cock.

01:15:54.508 --> 01:15:56.176
Well' you're a trouper, Stace.

01:15:56.343 --> 01:15:59.638
Oh' but if I start making weird faces
or anything during the scene'

01:15:59.805 --> 01:16:02.391
it's just because
I've been constipated all day.

01:16:02.558 --> 01:16:05.519
Oh' shit' uh. We don't have
to shoot the scene tonight.

01:16:05.686 --> 01:16:08.272
No, I want to. Anal's great
for when you're constipated.

01:16:08.438 --> 01:16:10.774
It totally loosens you up.

01:16:11.483 --> 01:16:14.319
I use ex-lax' but good to know.

01:16:14.486 --> 01:16:17.990
Okay, I never thought
I would have that conversation.

01:16:18.156 --> 01:16:20.450
So are we starting
with Lester and Stacey tonight?

01:16:20.617 --> 01:16:22.494
We were supposed to start
with Lester and Miri.

01:16:22.661 --> 01:16:25.497
I know. She... We're not gonna do that.
I don't think Miri's gonna...

01:16:33.422 --> 01:16:35.007
...do that.

01:16:37.801 --> 01:16:41.513
Hey. So where are we shooting this?
Over here?

01:16:42.264 --> 01:16:45.142
- What are you doing here?
- Me and Lester.

01:16:46.518 --> 01:16:48.645
Our scene's tonight, right?

01:16:50.689 --> 01:16:53.233
Can I talk to you for a minute
in the back?

01:16:53.734 --> 01:16:56.862
- Sure.
- Thanks.

01:16:58.572 --> 01:17:00.282
What do you want me to shoot here?

01:17:00.449 --> 01:17:03.869
Start with the close-ups of Lester
and Stacey. Give me a second, man.

01:17:04.578 --> 01:17:05.662
What an artist.

01:17:06.371 --> 01:17:10.167
Okay, uh. Did I do something
wrong to you?

01:17:10.334 --> 01:17:11.376
No.

01:17:12.044 --> 01:17:13.170
Then why are you here?

01:17:13.337 --> 01:17:16.548
I'm here for the same reason
you're here. To make the movie.

01:17:17.215 --> 01:17:20.719
Okay, just, like'
for your own personal information,

01:17:21.595 --> 01:17:23.472
you're acting really weird right now.

01:17:23.639 --> 01:17:26.224
I'm acting weird?
I think you're acting weird right now.

01:17:26.391 --> 01:17:28.602
Oh' I'm acting...
How exactly am I acting weird?

01:17:28.769 --> 01:17:31.438
You've been trying to keep me
from fucking anybody but you

01:17:31.605 --> 01:17:33.565
since we started this thing.

01:17:34.232 --> 01:17:37.194
Maybe I was thinking
about your feelings.

01:17:37.361 --> 01:17:40.238
Were you thinking of my feelings
when you were banging Stacey?

01:17:40.405 --> 01:17:42.741
Because that'd be really sad
for Stacey.

01:17:42.908 --> 01:17:45.744
She told me that you told her that
that was okay.

01:17:45.911 --> 01:17:51.041
I told her that it was okay to ask you.

01:17:52.876 --> 01:17:57.214
Holy shit. I get it. I fucking get it.

01:17:57.381 --> 01:18:00.425
It was a test. That whole thing
was a fucking test, is that it?

01:18:01.343 --> 01:18:03.428
If it was, how do you think you did?

01:18:04.262 --> 01:18:05.472
We had a discussion, Miri.

01:18:05.639 --> 01:18:11.895
We had... Actually, we had many
discussions about how it was just sex

01:18:12.062 --> 01:18:14.940
- and how we wouldn't let it get weird.
- I'm not acting weird.

01:18:15.107 --> 01:18:18.902
You're acting like a jealous girlfriend
is what the fuck you're acting like.

01:18:19.069 --> 01:18:20.946
- I am not your girlfriend.
- I know that.

01:18:21.113 --> 01:18:24.866
You're not my boyfriend, so why are
we having this conversation right now?

01:18:25.033 --> 01:18:29.121
Because you're about to fuck Lester
to spite me, it seems like.

01:18:29.287 --> 01:18:31.665
Did you fuck Stacey to spite me? No.

01:18:31.832 --> 01:18:34.042
You fucked her
like you fucked every other bitch

01:18:34.209 --> 01:18:36.294
and never gave a shit
how I felt about it.

01:18:36.795 --> 01:18:39.089
- Well' that was before.
- Before what?

01:18:39.256 --> 01:18:43.593
Look, don't fucking pretend that the
other night, you and me, right there,

01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:46.888
that that didn't mean anything to you,
that you didn't feel it too.

01:18:47.055 --> 01:18:51.476
Oh. You're not getting all gooey
on me here, are you, Zack?

01:18:51.810 --> 01:18:53.228
You know what?

01:18:53.395 --> 01:18:56.356
If you were any other bitch
I didn't give a rat's ass about,

01:18:56.523 --> 01:18:58.650
I would tell you
to go fuck yourself right now

01:18:58.817 --> 01:19:02.279
because I fucking hate
this game-playing shit.

01:19:02.446 --> 01:19:04.448
But you,
you mean more to me than that'

01:19:04.614 --> 01:19:06.992
so I'm just gonna lay this out
on front street.

01:19:07.159 --> 01:19:10.328
I know you felt something big,
something real the other night

01:19:10.495 --> 01:19:13.206
when we were together
because I felt it too.

01:19:13.373 --> 01:19:18.086
We tried to fuck and instead,
we wound up making love.

01:19:18.253 --> 01:19:21.840
So if this is what you need to hear in
order to keep you from fucking Lester,

01:19:22.007 --> 01:19:27.429
if this is what you need, then fine.
Here it is, I'm gonna say it.

01:19:28.180 --> 01:19:29.931
I love you, Miri.

01:19:34.186 --> 01:19:35.645
Happy?

01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:37.731
Oh' Jesus.

01:19:37.898 --> 01:19:40.859
You better get ahold of yourself, Zack,
because we just fucked.

01:19:42.569 --> 01:19:44.279
Okay.

01:19:50.869 --> 01:19:53.205
What if I didn't fuck Stacey?

01:19:54.164 --> 01:19:55.791
But you did.

01:19:55.957 --> 01:19:59.836
You know what?
I don't fucking give a shit.

01:20:00.712 --> 01:20:02.380
Wait...

01:20:07.052 --> 01:20:10.847
All right, don't forget I'm down here.
Watch that pullout, huh?

01:20:11.014 --> 01:20:12.766
Yeah.

01:20:12.933 --> 01:20:16.728
Mmm.
This is some damn good coffee.

01:20:16.895 --> 01:20:19.231
- Where you going?
- Getting the fuck out of here.

01:20:19.397 --> 01:20:21.024
We gotta finish this movie.

01:20:26.988 --> 01:20:28.323
Yo!

01:20:31.993 --> 01:20:33.912
You believe this shit?

01:20:34.079 --> 01:20:35.455
Do you believe this shit?

01:20:35.622 --> 01:20:37.332
What the fuck just happened
in there?

01:20:37.499 --> 01:20:39.501
I'll tell you what
just happened in there.

01:20:39.668 --> 01:20:42.337
That chick frosted me
like I was a fucking cake.

01:21:00.438 --> 01:21:02.190
Zack.

01:21:19.082 --> 01:21:21.459
Okay, seriously'
get a picture of me right now.

01:21:22.002 --> 01:21:24.129
I'm hunting humans.

01:21:24.296 --> 01:21:27.299
- Dude' check it out. Ooh.
- Oh, shit.

01:21:27.465 --> 01:21:29.759
Seriously,
let's shoot the shit out of this bitch.

01:21:29.926 --> 01:21:32.637
- Where you aiming at?
- Cock shots?

01:21:32.804 --> 01:21:34.139
Cock shots.

01:21:48.278 --> 01:21:50.614
We shot you in the balls, cunt nugget.

01:21:51.114 --> 01:21:54.618
Well' it's my job to get shot in the balls,
so... oh, they're gone.

01:21:54.784 --> 01:21:55.827
Excuse me.

01:21:55.994 --> 01:21:58.246
Didn't you used to work at
the Bean-N-Gone in Monroeville?

01:21:59.581 --> 01:22:03.793
I sure as shit hope this pays better,
I tell you.

01:22:07.505 --> 01:22:10.008
So why don't they just shoot you
with a puck?

01:22:10.175 --> 01:22:11.217
What do you mean?

01:22:11.384 --> 01:22:15.138
I mean, what does paintball
got to do with hockey?

01:22:15.931 --> 01:22:17.599
Nothing, I guess.

01:22:17.766 --> 01:22:20.393
- So ain't no prizes or...?
- No, no.

01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:22.520
So, what are they paying $5 for?

01:22:22.687 --> 01:22:25.815
To shoot a Broad Street Bully
in the balls.

01:22:27.359 --> 01:22:29.277
White people are fucked up.

01:22:30.111 --> 01:22:31.446
Yup' they sure are.

01:22:31.613 --> 01:22:34.532
It's a living. You've been getting
the checks I've been sending?

01:22:34.699 --> 01:22:36.868
Yes, thank you very much.
I appreciate that.

01:22:37.535 --> 01:22:41.623
Probably didn't save you from a
brutal tongue-lashing, though, huh?

01:22:41.790 --> 01:22:45.210
You know, the wife
never found out about the camera,

01:22:45.377 --> 01:22:47.128
because I paid off the bills.

01:22:47.295 --> 01:22:48.838
How did you manage that?

01:22:49.339 --> 01:22:53.093
- Because now I'm Oprah rich.
- No way.

01:22:53.259 --> 01:22:56.388
- The post office fucking settled?
- Hundred-sixty large' son.

01:22:56.554 --> 01:23:00.517
- Nice, man. Congratulations.
- A beautiful day, thank you very much.

01:23:00.684 --> 01:23:02.477
I thought
you made that whole thing up.

01:23:02.644 --> 01:23:03.895
No, no. It was very real.

01:23:04.062 --> 01:23:06.064
You can believe it.

01:23:06.398 --> 01:23:08.733
Even though she's spending all of it.

01:23:13.863 --> 01:23:16.992
Well' since you ain't gonna ask me,
I'll just go ahead and tell you.

01:23:17.158 --> 01:23:20.870
- No, I have not seen Miri.
- I wasn't gonna ask that.

01:23:21.037 --> 01:23:24.082
Oh' I suppose you weren't gonna ask
about your movie, neither?

01:23:24.249 --> 01:23:27.585
Look, that's why I came down here.
I need you to come take a look at it.

01:23:27.752 --> 01:23:30.463
- I'm not interested. Sorry.
- You'd better get interested

01:23:30.630 --> 01:23:33.675
- because you still owe me money.
- What's wrong with the movie?

01:23:33.842 --> 01:23:36.720
The story doesn't make sense.

01:23:36.886 --> 01:23:39.472
- The story?
- The story doesn't make sense.

01:23:39.639 --> 01:23:42.267
It's a fucking porno movie, man.
What story?

01:23:42.434 --> 01:23:45.603
It's a movie, dog,
and a movie's gotta have an ending,

01:23:45.770 --> 01:23:47.397
which we don't have at the moment.

01:23:47.564 --> 01:23:50.442
Come shot, credits.
There's your fucking ending.

01:23:50.608 --> 01:23:52.318
Do me this favor, okay?

01:23:52.485 --> 01:23:55.155
When you're done
getting your nuts blown off'

01:23:55.321 --> 01:24:00.076
come back to humble Monroeville
to my crib for a couple hours'

01:24:00.243 --> 01:24:03.705
check out the flick,
you tell me what's missing.

01:24:04.664 --> 01:24:05.790
No.

01:24:06.041 --> 01:24:09.461
I'll tell you what, you do that,
you don't owe me shit no more.

01:24:09.627 --> 01:24:11.796
- Really?
- Really.

01:24:11.963 --> 01:24:14.215
- Is your wife home?
- Yes.

01:24:15.300 --> 01:24:19.471
- Maybe I should leave the pads on.
- You got some extra ones?

01:24:31.983 --> 01:24:33.068
Hey, honey.

01:24:33.234 --> 01:24:35.904
Where the fuck you been?
And who in the fuck is this now?

01:24:36.321 --> 01:24:37.989
Would you calm down, woman?
Goddamn.

01:24:38.156 --> 01:24:40.617
You already left one white boy
down in my basement

01:24:40.784 --> 01:24:43.661
while you off gallivanting and shit.
What if this motherfucker

01:24:43.828 --> 01:24:47.165
- was all grabby on me?
- Ain't nobody wanna grab on you.

01:24:47.332 --> 01:24:50.168
Oh' what in the fuck
is that supposed to mean?

01:24:50.335 --> 01:24:53.254
- Ain't nobody wanna grab on you.
- White boys love me.

01:24:53.588 --> 01:24:54.631
White boy.

01:24:56.132 --> 01:24:58.176
- I said, white boy.
- Yeah?

01:24:58.343 --> 01:24:59.761
You'd fuck me, wouldn't you?

01:25:00.428 --> 01:25:02.013
- Should I say yes?
- Just say yes.

01:25:02.180 --> 01:25:03.848
Yeah.

01:25:07.018 --> 01:25:10.230
- Why don't you, uh, head downstairs?
- Oh, okay.

01:25:10.396 --> 01:25:11.898
It's just through this hallway.

01:25:12.065 --> 01:25:14.109
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

01:25:16.694 --> 01:25:18.196
What the fuck you looking at?

01:25:18.363 --> 01:25:20.865
Why you gotta be yelling at me
in front of my director?

01:25:21.032 --> 01:25:22.367
- Oh, he's a director?
- Yeah.

01:25:22.534 --> 01:25:24.536
I didn't know that.
Shit, he's a director.

01:25:24.702 --> 01:25:28.623
Well' why don't he direct my ass to a
new husband? How about that shit?

01:25:28.790 --> 01:25:31.209
- That's the bedroom.
- Keep talking, maybe he will.

01:25:31.376 --> 01:25:33.419
Oh' don't nobody
want them saggy-ass balls!

01:25:33.586 --> 01:25:36.673
Saggy balls? Look at these
sagging-ass titties you got around here.

01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:39.467
- You could tie these together.
- Motherfucker, we match.

01:25:43.054 --> 01:25:44.514
Oh' shit.

01:25:45.682 --> 01:25:47.684
Where's my paintball gun at?

01:25:47.851 --> 01:25:50.562
Look at you, editor and DP.
You got your shit covered, man.

01:25:50.728 --> 01:25:54.816
Please, don't ever say "shit-covered"
to me again.

01:25:56.234 --> 01:26:00.029
Roll the film for the man, please,
so we can see what he thinks.

01:26:00.196 --> 01:26:03.366
Just jump through it. I ain't
got all night. The bitch is on me.

01:26:04.742 --> 01:26:07.537
"Nigga Rich Productions." Classy.

01:26:07.704 --> 01:26:10.165
- Yeah, DreamWorks was taken.
- Was it?

01:26:10.331 --> 01:26:13.001
Plus' it sounds like an underground
gay fuck club.

01:26:13.168 --> 01:26:14.878
"I met a guy at DreamWorks." Yeah.

01:26:15.044 --> 01:26:19.424
All right, so we got
Lester and Stacey fucking.

01:26:19.591 --> 01:26:21.384
Then we got
Barry and Bubbles fucking.

01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:25.013
And then this boring bullshit.

01:26:30.101 --> 01:26:33.479
Okay, just, uh, go to the next scene,
would you?

01:26:34.856 --> 01:26:35.899
Uh...

01:26:36.065 --> 01:26:39.235
- What next scene?
- The one with Miri and Lester?

01:26:39.402 --> 01:26:41.321
We never shot it.

01:26:41.946 --> 01:26:44.449
- Why not?
- Because after you left that night,

01:26:44.616 --> 01:26:47.535
Miri came out of the backroom
and said she couldn't do it.

01:26:47.702 --> 01:26:51.706
- We wrapped after that.
- Wrapped? So...

01:26:53.082 --> 01:26:56.127
- Wait, so Miri...
- Never fucked nobody.

01:26:56.294 --> 01:26:57.378
Just you.

01:26:58.963 --> 01:27:02.634
Now, I wonder why she did that.

01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:05.094
- Hm.
- Hm.

01:27:06.304 --> 01:27:10.725
You see, there was a time when I was
just a bitter old fuck making coffees,

01:27:10.892 --> 01:27:12.852
and Stacey was just a lap dancer

01:27:13.019 --> 01:27:15.021
and Barry and Bubbles
didn't know each other

01:27:15.188 --> 01:27:18.483
and this fool here,
hell, I don't even know what he was.

01:27:18.650 --> 01:27:21.736
- A white supremacist.
- Man' fuck you.

01:27:21.903 --> 01:27:23.738
Then two people come along

01:27:23.905 --> 01:27:27.116
and showed us something
we didn't know existed.

01:27:27.283 --> 01:27:32.288
A world of possibilities
where plain old people just like us

01:27:32.455 --> 01:27:34.707
could do something special.

01:27:34.874 --> 01:27:38.628
Even if it's something as simple
as filming people fucking.

01:27:49.472 --> 01:27:52.767
Sometimes we just need someone

01:27:52.934 --> 01:27:56.938
to show us something
we can't see for ourselves

01:27:59.565 --> 01:28:01.985
and then we're changed forever.

01:28:13.204 --> 01:28:16.457
So as you can see'
our movie ain't got no ending.

01:28:18.042 --> 01:28:20.086
Every movie needs an ending'
don't it?

01:28:24.799 --> 01:28:25.842
Peace.

01:28:28.344 --> 01:28:32.098
Delaney,
you're a slick cupid motherfucker.

01:28:32.557 --> 01:28:34.434
Ain't love grand?

01:28:34.600 --> 01:28:37.645
Why the fuck is this white boy
running through my goddamn house?

01:28:39.022 --> 01:28:40.732
Sometimes.

01:28:53.703 --> 01:28:55.330
Miri.

01:28:56.039 --> 01:28:58.458
- Miri.
- Zack?

01:28:59.625 --> 01:29:01.085
Miri. I'm sorry.
- Get out.

01:29:01.252 --> 01:29:02.754
- Close the door.
- It was closed.

01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:06.132
- It was closed over...
- Just close the fucking door' Zack.

01:29:06.299 --> 01:29:10.970
I never slept with Stacey that night,
okay? I swear to God.

01:29:11.137 --> 01:29:13.264
When we got into my room,
you know what we did?

01:29:13.431 --> 01:29:18.019
We talked about you, and us
and how things were different

01:29:18.186 --> 01:29:21.189
and how I was
too much of a fucking pussy

01:29:21.356 --> 01:29:23.941
to just tell you how I felt about you.

01:29:24.650 --> 01:29:29.030
And I know... I know that that's only
because of all the stupid shit we said

01:29:29.197 --> 01:29:34.494
about how we wouldn't let sex
change us, but it did. It changed me.

01:29:35.286 --> 01:29:37.747
That has to be love, right?

01:29:38.039 --> 01:29:40.333
It has to be love

01:29:40.833 --> 01:29:44.962
and just so you know, I can't go back
to being just friends anymore,

01:29:46.297 --> 01:29:48.132
- because I just can't.
- Good.

01:29:48.299 --> 01:29:50.259
And I think...

01:29:51.594 --> 01:29:53.221
I think that you feel the same way.

01:29:54.055 --> 01:29:58.976
Because that night after I left,
you didn't fuck Lester.

01:30:02.480 --> 01:30:04.315
What's up, Zack?

01:30:14.700 --> 01:30:15.743
You know what?

01:30:15.910 --> 01:30:18.621
I don't care that you're fucking
Lester, okay? How's that?

01:30:18.788 --> 01:30:21.499
- Oh, shit.
- I don't wanna be with anyone but you.

01:30:21.666 --> 01:30:26.462
So I will wait forever for you, okay?
I will wait the rest of my life

01:30:26.629 --> 01:30:29.924
because I love you, and I have
for as long as I can remember.

01:30:30.550 --> 01:30:33.803
And I would rather die
than be without you, Miriam Linky.

01:30:33.970 --> 01:30:35.596
Miri's last name is Linky?

01:30:36.431 --> 01:30:39.016
You're gonna fuck a guy
who doesn't know your last name?

01:30:39.183 --> 01:30:42.019
Or that you beat up Carl Roth
in the sixth grade? I know that.

01:30:42.186 --> 01:30:45.106
Or what your senior prom dress
would've looked like had we gone

01:30:45.273 --> 01:30:48.192
but we decided not to,
and we got drunk alone instead.

01:30:48.359 --> 01:30:50.361
Or that you washed your hair
in the toilet.

01:30:50.528 --> 01:30:51.696
We're not fucking' Zack.

01:30:51.863 --> 01:30:53.781
Or that you're not fucking Zack...
What?

01:30:53.948 --> 01:30:56.033
I asked her to fuck me.
She wouldn't do it.

01:30:56.200 --> 01:30:59.203
I even tried to talk her into giving me
the fucking Dutch rudder.

01:30:59.370 --> 01:31:01.080
Shot me down on that too.

01:31:02.206 --> 01:31:05.209
- And a Dutch rudder is?
- Don't know what a Dutch rudder...?

01:31:05.376 --> 01:31:06.878
All right, you grab your dick,

01:31:07.044 --> 01:31:09.088
then you have someone else
work your arm.

01:31:09.255 --> 01:31:10.548
Here, let me show you.

01:31:10.715 --> 01:31:13.885
All right, grab my arm. I'm grabbing
my dick, you're grabbing my arm.

01:31:14.051 --> 01:31:17.221
Now work it. Work my arm.
See that shit? Work it up and down.

01:31:17.388 --> 01:31:19.432
It's like someone else
is jerking you off.

01:31:19.599 --> 01:31:20.641
Okay.

01:31:20.808 --> 01:31:22.435
There's the double Dutch rudder,

01:31:22.602 --> 01:31:24.896
which' I grab my dick,
you grab your dick,

01:31:25.062 --> 01:31:27.648
you work my arm, I work your arm'
same time.

01:31:27.815 --> 01:31:30.193
It's like jerking off together
but not gay.

01:31:30.359 --> 01:31:32.862
We're not touching dicks,
each other's dicks anyway.

01:31:33.029 --> 01:31:35.948
I'm touching my own dick.
You're working it, and I'm loving it.

01:31:36.115 --> 01:31:39.035
It feels good, sir. Try me, come on.

01:31:39.202 --> 01:31:41.787
Sorry to change the subject on you,
Lester,

01:31:41.954 --> 01:31:47.627
but if you're not fucking Miri,
why is your dick out right now?

01:31:47.793 --> 01:31:50.838
Because I live here now,
and I like to be naked.

01:31:51.422 --> 01:31:52.924
- What?
- When you moved out,

01:31:53.090 --> 01:31:56.511
she couldn't afford to pay her rent
by herself, so I moved in to help.

01:31:56.886 --> 01:31:58.763
But you just came out of her room.

01:31:58.930 --> 01:32:01.098
That's my room now.
She moved in your old room.

01:32:01.265 --> 01:32:03.935
Wait, wait, wait. She changed rooms?

01:32:04.101 --> 01:32:07.772
Yeah, she said she did it because she
missed the smell of you or some shit.

01:32:10.107 --> 01:32:11.859
I don't smell anything.

01:32:12.026 --> 01:32:14.946
But you know what?
That probably means she loves you.

01:32:16.781 --> 01:32:19.825
- Night, Zack.
- Night.

01:32:24.121 --> 01:32:25.248
Do you?

01:32:28.167 --> 01:32:29.377
Then why are you crying?

01:32:30.211 --> 01:32:32.672
Because I missed you so much.

01:32:33.464 --> 01:32:35.132
Me too.

01:32:36.384 --> 01:32:38.427
I love you.

01:32:42.515 --> 01:32:44.308
- I love you, I love you.
- I love you.

01:32:44.475 --> 01:32:45.977
I don't mean to alarm you

01:32:46.143 --> 01:32:48.646
but I think I just jerked off Lester
a little bit.

01:32:49.730 --> 01:32:52.066
- The Dutch rudder?
- Yeah, it's ingenious, right?

01:32:52.233 --> 01:32:55.611
If you ask me nicely, I will
Dutch-rudder you the rest of our lives.

01:32:55.778 --> 01:32:59.156
Good. I'm getting tired
of fucking the Fleshlight.

01:32:59.323 --> 01:33:00.700
- You fucked it?
- Yeah.

01:33:00.866 --> 01:33:03.411
- What'd it feel like?
- Like fucking a flashlight.

01:33:03.995 --> 01:33:07.957
Wrong room.
- Oh, God. That's gross.

01:33:09.166 --> 01:33:11.836
Let us fuck.

01:36:11.515 --> 01:36:14.018
Hello.
Welcome to Nigga Rich Productions'

01:36:14.185 --> 01:36:17.062
home of
Zack and Miri Make Your Porno,

01:36:17.229 --> 01:36:18.981
the production house for the couple

01:36:19.148 --> 01:36:21.776
looking to put a little spice
in their sex life.

01:36:21.942 --> 01:36:25.404
- Shall we take a look around?
- Fuck me so hard. Oh, God.

01:36:25.571 --> 01:36:29.533
First, you'll meet for a consultation
with one of our romance-ologists,

01:36:29.700 --> 01:36:32.203
who'll coach you
through that initial awkward stage

01:36:32.369 --> 01:36:33.913
before you're camera-ready.

01:36:34.079 --> 01:36:38.626
So we will start off
with some erotic massage and some...

01:36:38.793 --> 01:36:41.754
Dude. Some light petting.

01:36:41.921 --> 01:36:43.464
That sounds good.

01:36:43.631 --> 01:36:47.551
Are you guys sure you don't wanna do
some, uh, butt-sack work too?

01:36:47.718 --> 01:36:49.762
- Uh, let's move on' shall we?
- Why?

01:36:49.929 --> 01:36:52.223
From their break-out hit,
Swallow My Cockuccino,

01:36:52.389 --> 01:36:54.850
to the multi-million selling
Swallow My Cockuccino II

01:36:55.017 --> 01:36:57.102
and the award-winning
Star Whores saga,

01:36:57.269 --> 01:37:00.231
including Revenge of the Shit:
The All-Anal Final Chapter,

01:37:00.397 --> 01:37:02.233
Zack and Miri have proven
time and again

01:37:02.399 --> 01:37:05.152
that they know how to shoot hot sex.

01:37:06.111 --> 01:37:12.827
As an actor, I've sometimes brought
my work home with me inappropriately.

01:37:12.993 --> 01:37:17.414
When you're telling your real-life lover
in the bedroom'

01:37:17.581 --> 01:37:20.167
to' you know' bend over
while you cake your hand in K-Y,

01:37:20.334 --> 01:37:22.837
it is a sign that the romance is dead,
I think.

01:37:23.003 --> 01:37:26.507
Then we turned to the professionals
at Zack and Miri Make Your Porno.

01:37:26.674 --> 01:37:29.802
Oh' my God,
they totally saved our civil union.

01:37:29.969 --> 01:37:32.429
They filmed what was inside of us

01:37:32.596 --> 01:37:35.182
and not what was coming out of us
necessarily.

01:37:35.349 --> 01:37:37.768
It helped me see his asshole

01:37:37.935 --> 01:37:42.648
as not just a come dumpster,

01:37:42.815 --> 01:37:46.277
but a sign of his beauty' his flower.

01:37:46.443 --> 01:37:50.114
It became a, uh, gorgeous orchid.

01:37:50.281 --> 01:37:54.451
Orchids grow
in sort of the filthiest conditions.

01:37:54.618 --> 01:38:01.250
That's what his asshole became to me.
This beautiful flower amidst shit.

01:38:01.417 --> 01:38:03.961
- Honey, they get the metaphor.
- I don't think they do.

01:38:04.128 --> 01:38:06.922
Let's just say,
thank you to Zack and Miri.

01:38:07.089 --> 01:38:09.675
It's helped us out,
it's helped our friends.

01:38:09.842 --> 01:38:12.011
Enrique? Park?

01:38:12.177 --> 01:38:15.264
Park? Enrique?

01:38:15.472 --> 01:38:18.809
Can we get a little love
for Zack and Miri?

01:38:19.977 --> 01:38:23.564
They don't even know what's going on,
they're so pilled up.

01:38:24.189 --> 01:38:28.152
But don't take his word for it.
Just ask our co-founders.

01:38:28.861 --> 01:38:32.031
- Hi. I'm Miri Linky Brown.
- I'm Zack Linky Brown.

01:38:32.197 --> 01:38:35.075
Here at Zack and Miri
Make Your Porno, we're dedicated

01:38:35.242 --> 01:38:37.244
- to committing your love...
- Or lust.

01:38:37.411 --> 01:38:40.497
- to high-end, quality production
digital video.

01:38:40.664 --> 01:38:42.750
A forever keepsake of your passion.

01:38:42.917 --> 01:38:45.878
That's right, Miri. Why set up a camera
at the end of your bed

01:38:46.045 --> 01:38:48.714
and settle for one unflattering angle,

01:38:48.881 --> 01:38:52.092
when you could let the professionals
dazzle and delight your senses

01:38:52.259 --> 01:38:55.012
with an array of shots
so masterfully rendered

01:38:55.179 --> 01:38:57.598
you'll swear
Martin Scorsese snuck into your room

01:38:57.765 --> 01:38:59.475
and caught you fucking?

01:38:59.642 --> 01:39:01.852
And remember'
we're not just the presidents

01:39:02.019 --> 01:39:04.188
of Zack and Miri Make Your Porno.

01:39:04.355 --> 01:39:06.774
We're also clients.
