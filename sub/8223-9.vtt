00:01.202 --> 00:05.177
Attention, viewers. Do not try anything
you are about to see at home.

00:05.178 --> 00:08.079
We are what you call experts.

00:09.648 --> 00:12.750
On this combustible
episode of "mythbusters"...

00:12.751 --> 00:15.088
I see good things
in our future.

00:15.089 --> 00:16.905
...We test a tale

00:16.906 --> 00:18.878
That brings out the teenage boy
in all of us.

00:18.879 --> 00:21.100
Dude, you got to be careful.

00:21.101 --> 00:25.074
It's nonstop fireworks
for Tory, Grant, and Kari...

00:25.075 --> 00:27.403
When in peril, I will use
one of my co-workers

00:27.404 --> 00:29.165
As a human shield.

00:29.166 --> 00:31.826
...As they tackle
the myth of the human skyrocket.

00:31.827 --> 00:33.240
One.

00:33.241 --> 00:34.983
Oh, my God.

00:34.984 --> 00:37.344
Meantime, Adam and Jamie
try turning the tables

00:37.345 --> 00:40.300
On their favorite episode
of "CSI"...

00:40.301 --> 00:42.109
I am aimed.

00:42.110 --> 00:45.603
...To see if combining two
supposedly nonlethal weapons...

00:45.604 --> 00:48.925
Welcome, earthlings.
We mean you no harm.

00:48.926 --> 00:52.450
...Could actually
make them a deadly duo.

00:52.451 --> 00:53.990
There's your fireball.

00:53.991 --> 00:57.142
With any luck, we will end up
with a charred corpse.

00:57.143 --> 00:59.287
Stand clear.
I'm going hot.

01:03.237 --> 01:04.878
Who are the Mythbusters?

01:06.387 --> 01:07.991
Adam Savage...
Aah!

01:07.992 --> 01:10.066
That is science.
...And Jamie Hyneman.

01:10.067 --> 01:12.945
Things are gonna start to get
a little crazy in here.

01:12.946 --> 01:17.596
Between them, more than 30 years
of special-effects experience.

01:17.597 --> 01:19.100
Joining them --

01:19.101 --> 01:22.110
Grant Imahara...
Burn!

01:22.111 --> 01:23.214
...Kari Byron...

01:23.215 --> 01:24.384
Let's do it.

01:24.385 --> 01:25.922
...And Tory Belleci.

01:25.923 --> 01:27.192
But don't worry.
We're not gonna give up.

01:27.193 --> 01:28.998
They don't just tell the myths.

01:28.999 --> 01:32.611
They put them to the test.

01:32.612 --> 01:35.688
-- <font color="#ffff00">Captions by vita -&www.M</font>

01:35.689 --> 01:38.865
Captions paid for by
discovery communications

01:38.866 --> 01:44.382
First up, a shocking tale
of crime-scene chaos.

01:44.383 --> 01:46.820
So, what do we got?

01:46.821 --> 01:48.322
Well, you remember
a few months ago

01:48.323 --> 01:49.827
That you and I did
a cameo on "CSI"?

01:49.828 --> 01:53.135
I do. We played scientists
in lab coats.

01:53.136 --> 01:55.943
It was about a perp who had
spontaneously combusted

01:55.944 --> 01:57.246
After being hit with a stun gun,

01:57.247 --> 01:59.384
And it turned out,
upon investigation,

01:59.385 --> 02:01.422
That prior to being hit
with the stun gun,

02:01.423 --> 02:02.860
He was pepper-sprayed,

02:02.861 --> 02:05.667
And that the pepper spray
had a flammable component in it

02:05.668 --> 02:08.239
Which, when coupled
with the spark of the stun gun,

02:08.240 --> 02:11.079
Caused him to burst
into a huge fireball.

02:11.080 --> 02:13.451
And guess what happened
after that episode aired.

02:13.452 --> 02:15.389
We got a ton of requests

02:15.390 --> 02:17.060
To do it ourselves
and test it for real.

02:17.061 --> 02:18.530
Exactly right.

02:18.531 --> 02:21.971
It would appear that not only
did we make a cameo on "CSI,"

02:21.972 --> 02:25.177
But "CSI" is making
a cameo on "Mythbusters."

02:26.715 --> 02:30.856
The science unfolds
in the C.S.I. Lab

02:30.857 --> 02:33.996
As Nick Stokes shows
that stun gun plus pepper spray

02:33.997 --> 02:37.303
Equals an instant,
massive fireball.

02:37.304 --> 02:39.106
It's a nice bit of tv,

02:39.107 --> 02:43.314
But we all want to know
if it works in real life.

02:43.315 --> 02:46.320
Well, if I'm gonna potentially
set something on fire,

02:46.321 --> 02:48.992
I think right here
under Jamie's exhaust hood

02:48.993 --> 02:51.429
Is as good a place as any
to do it safely.

02:51.430 --> 02:54.001
The boys have made
a bold decision

02:54.002 --> 02:56.437
To simply set up the scene
and go for it.

02:56.438 --> 03:00.112
Standing in for the victim
is one dead pig.

03:00.113 --> 03:02.050
We use pigs a lot on this show

03:02.051 --> 03:04.121
Because they're
great human analogues.

03:04.122 --> 03:07.360
But we're not wasting them
because they're too darn tasty.

03:07.361 --> 03:09.732
In fact, after we're done
with him here,

03:09.733 --> 03:12.069
I'm taking him home
and cooking him up.

03:12.070 --> 03:13.906
You ready? I am.
Let's hook it up.

03:13.907 --> 03:15.508
Okay.

03:16.976 --> 03:20.213
With the pig analogue
securely fastened,

03:20.214 --> 03:23.520
Adam fits a small flannel shirt
they've been saving

03:23.521 --> 03:26.626
For just the right occasion.

03:26.627 --> 03:28.463
There we go.

03:28.464 --> 03:30.133
Now Jamie unloads

03:30.134 --> 03:32.805
A whole can
of police-issue pepper spray.

03:32.806 --> 03:37.746
All right, time to take him down
with the stun gun.

03:37.747 --> 03:41.718
And hopefully replicate
that "CSI" fireball.

03:41.719 --> 03:44.256
I am aimed, and...

03:44.257 --> 03:45.925
3...

03:45.926 --> 03:47.427
I got to say, I don't think

03:47.428 --> 03:49.364
We're gonna get fire
on this one.

03:49.365 --> 03:50.366
Okay.

03:50.367 --> 03:52.569
...2...1...

03:59.047 --> 04:00.348
What do you know?
I was right.

04:00.349 --> 04:02.719
Yep. No fire.

04:02.720 --> 04:04.121
That's disappointing.

04:04.122 --> 04:07.059
That's putting it
mildly. It's a complete dud.

04:07.060 --> 04:11.032
Even Adam's surprised by
the totality of the failure.

04:11.033 --> 04:12.134
I don't know what to say.

04:12.135 --> 04:13.770
We did everything right --
no flaming pig.

04:13.771 --> 04:14.871
Yeah, well, there are

04:14.872 --> 04:16.373
A number of different things
going on here,

04:16.374 --> 04:18.175
And I think we need to break
them out separately

04:18.176 --> 04:19.274
To see what's happening.

04:19.276 --> 04:20.810
Before we call it.
Yeah.

04:20.810 --> 04:23.279
Okay, let's do that.

04:23.280 --> 04:24.914
And here's the breakdown.

04:24.915 --> 04:27.349
Successful combustion
needs three things.

04:27.350 --> 04:30.284
The first is oxygen,
and there's plenty of that.

04:30.285 --> 04:32.453
Second is something combustible and
there's plent of that --

04:32.454 --> 04:34.721
Supposedly the pepper-soaked shirt.

04:34.722 --> 04:37.690
Third is a reliable source
of ignition.

04:37.691 --> 04:42.327
So let's reboot this myth by
reexamining the stun gun.

04:42.328 --> 04:44.930
The operation of these stun guns
is relatively simple,

04:44.931 --> 04:46.298
And it happens in two phases.

04:46.299 --> 04:47.499
Allow me to illustrate.

04:47.500 --> 04:49.934
The first phase --
when you pull the trigger,

04:49.935 --> 04:52.736
The gun fires a pair of shiny
little barbs across the room

04:52.737 --> 04:55.372
That embed themselves
right into your skin.

04:55.373 --> 04:57.240
And the second part --
it starts pumping voltage

04:57.241 --> 04:59.409
Through these wires into those
barbs and into your body,

04:59.410 --> 05:00.977
And when that voltage
gets to your body,

05:00.978 --> 05:02.712
It starts interrupting
your brain's ability

05:02.713 --> 05:04.047
To tell your muscles
what to do,

05:04.048 --> 05:06.082
And you pretty much collapse
in a heap on the ground.

05:06.083 --> 05:08.851
But the question remains --

05:08.852 --> 05:11.620
Can even 50,000 volts
produce enough spark

05:11.621 --> 05:13.689
To start a human bonfire?

05:15.693 --> 05:18.495
There you go.
Plenty of sparks.

05:18.496 --> 05:20.730
I have to say,
I'm kind of surprised.

05:20.731 --> 05:22.398
I was actually expecting
that once those barbs

05:22.399 --> 05:23.967
Embedded themselves
in the pig flesh,

05:23.968 --> 05:26.203
They'd complete a circuit and we
wouldn't see any sparks,

05:26.204 --> 05:27.404
But we do.

05:27.405 --> 05:29.138
Look at that.

05:29.139 --> 05:32.173
I was also surprised
that the barbs

05:32.174 --> 05:35.339
Were creating sparks while they
were fully embedded in the pig,

05:35.340 --> 05:37.469
But it's easy to understand why.

05:37.470 --> 05:39.698
The company has decided
it's most efficient

05:39.699 --> 05:41.965
To simply tie a knot
in the end of the wire

05:41.966 --> 05:44.966
So it locks into the hole
like so,

05:44.967 --> 05:47.136
And they know that,
given the fact

05:47.137 --> 05:49.638
That they're using such
high voltage in these things,

05:49.639 --> 05:51.906
That the spark will jump
across into the needle

05:51.907 --> 05:53.775
And do its job.

05:53.776 --> 05:55.476
But that jumping spark

05:55.477 --> 05:58.412
Also serves as a potential
source of ignition.

05:58.413 --> 06:01.815
But will it be
big enough to ignite the myth?

06:01.816 --> 06:04.651
You know, we've dabbled
with small sparks before.

06:04.652 --> 06:09.688
How hard can it be to blow up
a room full of gasoline?

06:09.689 --> 06:12.923
And often enough,
we're left disappointed.

06:12.924 --> 06:14.991
Nothing. What a shocker.

06:14.992 --> 06:18.293
So, ideally, they'd like
a much bigger spark.

06:18.294 --> 06:22.030
And they've worked out a way
that perfectly fits the myth.

06:22.031 --> 06:24.432
All right, let me describe
the experimental setup here.

06:24.433 --> 06:26.901
This ham hock is our perp.

06:26.902 --> 06:29.803
This barb is the barb
that's in his skin.

06:29.804 --> 06:33.473
This vinyl shower curtain
is our perp's clothing.

06:33.474 --> 06:34.874
And this barb is the barb

06:34.875 --> 06:36.942
That didn't make it all the way
to the perp's skin

06:36.943 --> 06:38.244
'cause it got caught up
in his clothing.

06:38.245 --> 06:40.412
Let's see what happens.

06:40.413 --> 06:42.981
It's an intriguing
twist on the basic test.

06:42.982 --> 06:45.317
But will it work?

06:46.786 --> 06:48.219
That's what I'm talking about.

06:48.220 --> 06:49.887
Nice big 3-centimeter spark

06:49.888 --> 06:52.790
Through the clothes
into the guy's flesh.

06:52.791 --> 06:54.492
Bingo.

06:54.493 --> 06:56.794
That's a big tick
for reliable ignition.

06:56.795 --> 06:59.729
Next up, they'll be pushing
the button on pepper spray.

07:02.232 --> 07:03.732
Our second myth has

07:03.733 --> 07:06.467
Blatant disregard
for self-preservation

07:06.468 --> 07:07.935
Written all over it.

07:07.936 --> 07:09.837
So, a guy is
lighting off fireworks

07:09.838 --> 07:11.539
At a German fireworks festival,

07:11.540 --> 07:13.841
And he decides to take
an action figure,

07:13.842 --> 07:16.513
Strap a skyrocket to it,
and send it flying.

07:16.514 --> 07:18.649
Well, I used to do that
all the time when I was kid.

07:18.650 --> 07:19.983
Yeah, but that's not the myth.

07:19.984 --> 07:23.219
The myth is that he
then decides to step it up

07:23.220 --> 07:25.121
And strap the fireworks
to himself.

07:25.122 --> 07:27.723
So he gets around
400 skyrockets,

07:27.724 --> 07:30.325
He attaches them to himself,
he builds a ramp,

07:30.326 --> 07:31.994
He lights them all off,
and whoosh.

07:31.995 --> 07:36.231
He goes flying
150 feet over a lake

07:36.232 --> 07:37.667
And splashes down to safety.

07:37.668 --> 07:40.268
The details are
delightfully vague.

07:40.269 --> 07:43.904
All we know is that some guy
builds some kind of ramp

07:43.905 --> 07:46.840
And launched himself
with 400 skyrockets.

07:46.841 --> 07:48.876
Is that even remotely possible,

07:48.877 --> 07:52.813
Or is it a special kind
of stupid?

07:52.814 --> 07:55.815
All we do know for sure is that
he wasn't a professional.

07:55.816 --> 07:57.748
So likely the fireworks he used
were over-the-counter.

07:57.749 --> 08:00.349
All right, well, why don't we
just start there?

08:00.350 --> 08:01.950
We'll take
some of these skyrockets,

08:01.951 --> 08:03.251
We'll add some weight,
and find out

08:03.252 --> 08:05.418
Exactly how much one of these
skyrockets can lift.

08:05.419 --> 08:07.650
Good idea,
because if we can find

08:07.651 --> 08:09.518
The carrying capacity
of a single firework,

08:09.519 --> 08:11.786
Then we can calculate
how many it's gonna take

08:11.787 --> 08:14.288
To lift an average man --
somebody like 200 pounds.

08:14.289 --> 08:16.757
So they book the bomb range

08:16.758 --> 08:19.626
And get hold of the biggest
over-the-counter skyrockets

08:19.627 --> 08:21.061
Money can buy.

08:21.062 --> 08:23.697
We're out
at the alameda county bomb range

08:23.698 --> 08:25.965
So we can test the most powerful
consumer fireworks

08:25.966 --> 08:27.300
That we can find.

08:27.301 --> 08:29.635
Then, with the help
of a high-speed camera

08:29.636 --> 08:32.438
And one of the biggest scales
we've ever used...

08:32.438 --> 08:33.639
Does this look straight?

08:33.640 --> 08:36.275
We'll time how long
it takes to get

08:36.275 --> 08:39.210
From the bottom of the scale
all the way to the top.

08:39.211 --> 08:41.611
That, plus knowing
how long the scale is,

08:41.613 --> 08:43.047
Will give us the speed.

08:43.048 --> 08:45.782
Once we have the speed,
we'll find the carrying capacity

08:45.783 --> 08:47.983
By adding weight
to the tip of the firework

08:47.984 --> 08:49.851
Until it slows it down by 50%.

08:49.852 --> 08:52.653
And we'll call that
our carrying capacity.

08:52.654 --> 08:54.922
The plan is rock solid,

08:54.923 --> 08:57.991
But it still needs
some caressing and finessing.

08:57.992 --> 09:00.592
Now, for these tests, it's
important that these skyrockets

09:00.593 --> 09:02.760
Have identical flight paths.

09:02.761 --> 09:04.095
So I've hooked up
this steel cable

09:04.096 --> 09:06.029
That we can connect
our fireworks to

09:06.030 --> 09:08.598
So that way, each test,
we have the same path

09:08.599 --> 09:11.199
But we do not change the thrust
of the rocket.

09:11.200 --> 09:12.833
The first control rocket

09:12.834 --> 09:14.935
Carries
no extra weight whatsoever.

09:14.936 --> 09:16.836
Here we go.

09:18.038 --> 09:21.606
Run! Run! Run!

09:26.076 --> 09:27.910
Whoa.

09:27.911 --> 09:29.178
Blink and you miss it.

09:29.179 --> 09:31.748
But the high-speed camera

09:31.749 --> 09:34.722
Captures and records
every detail.

09:34.723 --> 09:38.166
Okay, so we went 32 feet
in .4 secos.

09:38.167 --> 09:40.503
Okay, that's 80 feet
per second.

09:40.504 --> 09:43.308
That's around 55 miles an hour.
That's a pretty good speed.

09:43.309 --> 09:45.143
Great. Let's add some weight.
All right.

09:45.144 --> 09:47.011
The extra weight comes

09:47.012 --> 09:49.046
Courtesy of some
heavy-duty nuts.

09:49.047 --> 09:50.381
Each one weighs exactly...

09:50.382 --> 09:51.716
50 grams.

09:51.717 --> 09:53.785
All right.
This is perfect.

09:53.786 --> 09:55.419
So I'll just glue it
to the top of the rocket,

09:55.420 --> 09:57.889
And we'll find out if this
affects the thrust of it.

09:57.890 --> 09:59.190
Yeah.

09:59.191 --> 10:00.958
Kari lights the fuse...
There we go.

10:00.959 --> 10:02.693
...Then scampers.

10:05.063 --> 10:06.964
Oh!

10:08.132 --> 10:11.366
The extra weight
only swed the rocket by 20%.

10:11.367 --> 10:14.771
So instead of adding just one
more nut to the next rocket,

10:14.772 --> 10:17.206
They'll add two.

10:17.207 --> 10:20.910
Okay, this is consumer-grade
firework with 150-gram load.

10:20.911 --> 10:22.378
Here we go.

10:27.183 --> 10:28.651
Yeah!

10:28.652 --> 10:31.253
Definitely slowed it down.
Definitely.

10:31.254 --> 10:33.956
Yeah, we might have found
the number. I like that.

10:33.957 --> 10:35.090
The replay confirms

10:35.091 --> 10:36.623
That they've got
what they wanted --

10:36.624 --> 10:38.858
A 50% reduction in speed.

10:38.859 --> 10:42.790
That's the good news.
Now here's the bad news.

10:42.791 --> 10:45.893
Well, with 400 rockets,
150 grams,

10:45.894 --> 10:47.328
That's 60 kilograms.

10:47.329 --> 10:49.796
That's a carrying capacity
of about 130 pounds.

10:50.014 --> 10:53.333
But wait. The guy alone without all his
gear in this myth is 200 pounds.

10:53.334 --> 10:54.992
Yeah, it's not looking good for the myth.

10:54.993 --> 10:58.361
I mean, you would need well over
400 rockets to lift this guy.

10:58.362 --> 11:01.196
In fact, they'd need around 800

11:01.197 --> 11:04.265
Of these U.S.-Made rockets
to haul a full-grown man,

11:04.266 --> 11:08.201
So here's hoping
somebody's got a plan "b."

11:08.836 --> 11:11.704
After the break,
Adam and Jamie suit up

11:11.705 --> 11:14.739
For a spectacular
pepper-spray shootout.

11:14.740 --> 11:17.274
It's not everybody who gets to
come to work in their jammies.

11:25.275 --> 11:28.744
Out at the treasure
island fire test facility,

11:28.745 --> 11:32.579
Adam and Jamie plan
to ignite some pepper spray.

11:34.414 --> 11:36.748
I love it out here.

11:36.749 --> 11:39.283
They've already shown
that the spark from a stun gun

11:39.284 --> 11:41.352
Could have some kick to it.

11:41.353 --> 11:44.422
Now to advance
the investigation.

11:44.423 --> 11:46.424
Is pepper spray flammable?

11:46.425 --> 11:48.959
And if it is,
which one is the most flammable?

11:48.960 --> 11:51.161
Here's our methodology
for finding out.

11:51.162 --> 11:52.662
We're gonna take
each of our samples

11:52.663 --> 11:55.731
And spray it from this location
over this open flame,

11:55.732 --> 11:59.667
Both from 6 inches away like
this and from 18 inches away.

11:59.668 --> 12:02.101
Different sprays
have different recipes,

12:02.102 --> 12:04.270
So we'll test
five different types,

12:04.271 --> 12:07.639
Some of which aren't used
by the California cops.

12:07.640 --> 12:09.274
These pepper sprays
are nonlethal,

12:09.275 --> 12:10.876
But they are
really pretty nasty.

12:10.877 --> 12:13.214
In fact, when we were testing
with them earlier,

12:13.215 --> 12:14.984
I managed to get
some on my hands,

12:14.985 --> 12:16.786
And my skin was irritated
for days.

12:16.787 --> 12:19.855
The crew that was taping this
was coughing and sneezing.

12:19.856 --> 12:21.823
It was really
kind of unpleasant.

12:21.824 --> 12:26.127
So this time around, we've got
ahold of some levechem suits

12:26.128 --> 12:27.628
That we're gonna be wearing

12:27.629 --> 12:30.964
So we can focus on the testing
and not about how bad we feel.

12:30.965 --> 12:33.733
Adam's already dressed
for success,

12:33.734 --> 12:36.302
So Jamie, uh, follows suit.

12:36.303 --> 12:40.872
It's not everybody who gets to
come to work in their jammies.

12:40.873 --> 12:42.941
So a persistent rumor

12:42.942 --> 12:45.309
Is confirmed
by the great man himself.

12:45.310 --> 12:48.679
Jamie does go to bed
wearing hazmat pajamas.

12:48.680 --> 12:52.548
Welcome, earthlings.
We mean you no harm.

12:52.549 --> 12:57.286
Our first five samples tested
from 6 inches away.

12:57.287 --> 12:59.888
The first one's
supposed to be nonflammable.

12:59.889 --> 13:01.589
Let's see if it's true.

13:01.590 --> 13:03.291
Just for the record,

13:03.292 --> 13:05.759
That 6-inch gap is exactly
the industry standard

13:05.760 --> 13:07.227
For testing flammability.

13:07.228 --> 13:09.462
All right.
You ready for number 1?

13:09.463 --> 13:10.529
Yep.

13:10.530 --> 13:12.631
All right.
Here we go.

13:12.632 --> 13:16.733
The first canister fully lived
up to its no-burn promise.

13:16.734 --> 13:17.867
So let's check the second.

13:21.104 --> 13:22.238
Bupkes.

13:22.239 --> 13:24.373
That's two quick strikes,

13:24.374 --> 13:26.808
But the third
shows some promise.

13:28.377 --> 13:29.710
Oh. Not bad.

13:29.711 --> 13:32.245
As for number 4,

13:32.246 --> 13:34.448
Just lay back and bask

13:34.449 --> 13:37.084
In the ambient heat
of the can that can.

13:37.085 --> 13:41.589
Whoa! Ho!
That's the money right there.

13:41.590 --> 13:43.558
Want to see it again?

13:43.559 --> 13:44.926
I think we all do.

13:48.730 --> 13:50.696
The key thing
that made this a fireball

13:50.697 --> 13:52.863
Was the kind of propellant
it used.

13:52.864 --> 13:55.131
So, on to can 5.

13:57.167 --> 14:00.836
Oh!
5 is a contender.

14:02.605 --> 14:05.073
As it turns out, at 6 inches,

14:05.074 --> 14:08.509
2 out of our 5 samples
were aggressively flammable.

14:08.510 --> 14:11.111
So they found
the two most volatile cans,

14:11.112 --> 14:14.013
But there's no guarantee
that either one will ignite

14:14.014 --> 14:16.049
When it's sprayed on a fabric.

14:16.050 --> 14:18.184
To test that, we will be staging

14:18.185 --> 14:21.887
The world's first
wet-flannel-shirt contest.

14:25.157 --> 14:27.024
We're back in the shop
because we found

14:27.025 --> 14:28.959
Even the most powerful
consumer fireworks

14:28.960 --> 14:30.761
We can get
in the entire United States

14:30.762 --> 14:33.230
Did not have the thrust
we need to propel a man.

14:33.231 --> 14:35.365
So, since this myth
originated in Europe,

14:35.366 --> 14:37.499
We're thinking
maybe they had something

14:37.500 --> 14:38.767
A little more powerful.

14:38.768 --> 14:40.868
Now, since we weren't able
to get

14:40.869 --> 14:43.704
The european skyrockets
with the greater thrust,

14:43.705 --> 14:45.472
We have to make our own rocket.

14:45.473 --> 14:47.575
So we have
the next-best thing --

14:47.576 --> 14:48.842
A model rocket motor.

14:48.843 --> 14:50.444
It has the same exact thrust.

14:50.445 --> 14:53.380
Now what we need to do is
add a cone, attach a stick,

14:53.381 --> 14:55.815
And maybe make them
look more like skyrockets.

14:55.816 --> 15:00.519
Things get off
to a slowish start...

15:00.520 --> 15:02.320
I've glued myself
to the rocket already.

15:02.321 --> 15:04.954
...As they set about
custom-building an arsenal

15:04.955 --> 15:08.423
Of european-strength
single-stage skyrockets.

15:08.424 --> 15:11.963
We pride ourselves on quantity,
not quality.

15:11.964 --> 15:13.731
Let's hope he's joking,

15:13.732 --> 15:16.534
Because all these
homemade fireworks

15:16.535 --> 15:19.002
Have to be just as reliable
as the store-bought ones.

15:19.003 --> 15:20.403
That's it.

15:20.404 --> 15:22.638
If I won a pageant, this would
definitely be my bouquet.

15:22.639 --> 15:24.272
Those look awesome.

15:24.273 --> 15:26.373
All right. You guys ready
to set them off?

15:26.374 --> 15:29.576
Yeah.
Oh, yeah, definitely.

15:29.577 --> 15:31.944
So it's back to the
bomb range with nothing to prove.

15:31.945 --> 15:33.779
Yeah, I got high hopes.

15:33.780 --> 15:37.015
If these rockets can't bear
a much bigger load,

15:37.016 --> 15:39.017
The myth is as good as busted.

15:39.018 --> 15:41.519
All right, so our first test
is gonna be our control.

15:41.520 --> 15:45.022
This is our new and improved
rockets with no weights.

15:45.023 --> 15:47.324
We'll find out
how fast they go.

15:47.325 --> 15:49.192
This time,
they've hooked up the rocket

15:49.193 --> 15:51.661
To a much safer electric fuse,

15:51.662 --> 15:54.497
And Kari's about to show
how she responds

15:54.498 --> 15:56.265
In a moment of pure panic.

15:56.266 --> 15:58.900
In 3, 2, 1.

16:02.771 --> 16:03.938
Okay.

16:03.939 --> 16:05.806
The skyrocket turned kamikaze,

16:05.807 --> 16:08.709
But it stayed straight enough
for long enough

16:08.710 --> 16:10.577
To get the data --

16:10.578 --> 16:13.279
96 miles per hour
at the top of the scale.

16:13.280 --> 16:15.614
I also learned something
very valuable, which is,

16:15.615 --> 16:16.915
When in peril,

16:16.916 --> 16:19.751
I will use one of my co-workers
as a human shield.

16:19.752 --> 16:22.053
Sorry, Grant.

16:22.054 --> 16:24.155
But Grant remains unfazed.

16:24.156 --> 16:25.323
He's already decided

16:25.324 --> 16:27.992
They can afford
to up the starting weight.

16:27.993 --> 16:30.994
So, I think we can go
directly to the 150-gram load,

16:30.995 --> 16:33.430
Which is exactly what
the consumer-grade firework

16:33.431 --> 16:35.865
Could do for its
maximum capacity.

16:35.866 --> 16:38.768
By adding
small weights to single rockets,

16:38.769 --> 16:41.604
They hope to find out
if 400 fireworks

16:41.605 --> 16:43.706
Really could launch a human.

16:43.707 --> 16:46.207
In 3...2...1.

16:48.310 --> 16:49.577
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

16:49.578 --> 16:51.245
Wow!

16:51.246 --> 16:53.547
It's gone.

16:53.548 --> 16:56.884
I don't think that weight
did a whole lot.

16:56.885 --> 16:59.520
That weight didn't do anything.

16:59.521 --> 17:00.988
Actually, it did.

17:00.989 --> 17:04.123
But the homemade rocket bore
its burden with relative ease.

17:04.124 --> 17:04.223
Nice.

17:04.223 --> 17:05.357
But the homemade rocket bore
its burden with relative ease.

17:05.358 --> 17:07.358
That's crazy.

17:07.359 --> 17:10.728
All right. That is 53 miles
per hour, so not even 50% yet.

17:10.729 --> 17:12.363
Well,
I'd also like to point out

17:12.364 --> 17:14.265
That the commercial ones
that we were using before

17:14.266 --> 17:16.968
Looked like they were slowing when
they got to the top of the scale.

17:16.969 --> 17:19.237
These have way more thrust. I
think we can double the weight.

17:19.238 --> 17:21.873
All right. Let's take it
up to 300 grams.

17:21.874 --> 17:23.107
All right.

17:23.108 --> 17:25.140
So Tory glues six nuts

17:25.141 --> 17:28.138
To the top of the cone
of the next skyrocket.

17:28.140 --> 17:33.444
This seem dangerous to launch
300 grams of steel into the air?

17:33.445 --> 17:37.112
Well, given the flight
path of the first rocket, yeah.

17:38.615 --> 17:42.216
In 3...2...1.

17:44.518 --> 17:46.285
Nice.

17:46.286 --> 17:47.687
It lifted it.

17:47.688 --> 17:51.625
Great.
Let's see how fast it went.

17:51.626 --> 17:53.261
The high-speed confirms

17:53.262 --> 17:55.129
They've honed in
on the goldilocks figure

17:55.130 --> 17:56.964
For weight-bearing rockets.

17:56.965 --> 17:58.665
- That is cool.
- Wow.

17:58.666 --> 18:02.035
All right. And that is
43 miles per hour.

18:02.036 --> 18:03.770
And that's pretty impressive.

18:03.771 --> 18:05.604
Yeah, but it is slowing
at the end of the line,

18:05.605 --> 18:08.240
So I think we're gonna have
to call this the limit,

18:08.241 --> 18:10.342
The carrying capacity for
the rocket motor.

18:10.576 --> 18:12.010
Okay, with 300 grams added
to what is already 100 grams for the rocket.

18:12.011 --> 18:14.145
That means we're going to have to have

18:16.848 --> 18:17.081
about 400 rockets to get our
man off the ground.

18:18.650 --> 18:20.784
That gives validity to this myth.

18:20.785 --> 18:23.187
All right.
Guess we got to get building.

18:23.188 --> 18:24.922
Cool.
God, that's awesome.

18:24.923 --> 18:27.857
So, the myth
of the fireworks man

18:27.858 --> 18:29.358
Is alive and kicking.

18:29.359 --> 18:32.794
They just need to put
all that potency into practice.

18:39.240 --> 18:40.541
Well, so far, so good.

18:40.542 --> 18:42.409
Yep, stun guns do provide

18:42.410 --> 18:44.778
A very reasonable spark
for ignition,

18:44.779 --> 18:47.347
And some pepper sprays
are quite flammable.

18:47.348 --> 18:49.048
So now all we got to do
is put the two together

18:49.049 --> 18:52.285
And see if we get some kind
of spontaneous combustion.

18:52.286 --> 18:53.720
Slow down there, cowboy.

18:53.721 --> 18:56.323
I think there's one more thing
we could take a look at in here,

18:56.324 --> 18:57.724
Which is what kind of material

18:57.725 --> 18:59.758
Was the shirt made of
that the perp was wearing?

18:59.759 --> 19:01.760
There's a lot
of different things

19:01.761 --> 19:03.594
They make clothing out of,

19:03.595 --> 19:05.396
And some are more flammable
than others.

19:05.397 --> 19:07.398
I think we need to do some tests
and find out

19:07.399 --> 19:09.866
Which kind of material we can
find that burns the fastest.

19:09.867 --> 19:11.935
Okay.

19:11.936 --> 19:13.903
Armed with a lighter

19:13.904 --> 19:16.205
And a charming selection
of swatches,

19:16.206 --> 19:18.040
The method is
pretty straightforward.

19:18.041 --> 19:20.008
Fabric placed
on a 45-degree angle,

19:20.009 --> 19:22.643
Exposed to a lighter
at the bottom for one second

19:22.644 --> 19:26.713
And timed how long it takes
for the flame to reach the top.

19:26.714 --> 19:28.347
We compare all these
and figure out

19:28.348 --> 19:30.149
Which one's the most flammable.

19:30.150 --> 19:31.183
I like it.

19:31.184 --> 19:33.618
The guy on "CSI"
to get set on fire

19:33.619 --> 19:35.386
Was wearing a flannel shirt.

19:35.387 --> 19:36.520
Now, what is flannel?

19:36.521 --> 19:39.523
Well, in the early days,
it was a wool material.

19:39.524 --> 19:41.424
Then it was a wool blend.

19:41.425 --> 19:44.127
Now it can be virtually
any kind of material

19:44.128 --> 19:47.497
That is thick and sort of Fluffy
and has this plaid pattern.

19:47.498 --> 19:48.964
So, from natural fibers...

19:48.965 --> 19:50.399
Here comes cotton.

19:50.400 --> 19:52.134
...To acrylics and acetates,

19:52.135 --> 19:56.237
The guys put the torch to some
hopefully flammable fabrics.

19:56.238 --> 19:59.106
All right.
Let's try rayon.

19:59.107 --> 20:01.475
Some take their own sweet time.

20:01.476 --> 20:03.678
45 seconds.

20:03.679 --> 20:05.245
And that's it.

20:05.246 --> 20:07.747
Some just refuse to catch fire.

20:07.748 --> 20:12.251
No burning at all from wool.

20:12.252 --> 20:15.320
And others burn up
like a trail of gunpowder.

20:15.321 --> 20:19.924
Dude.
Fleece burns with vigor.

20:19.925 --> 20:23.261
Bang. That's it right there.
15 seconds.

20:23.262 --> 20:26.297
Now all that remains
is to find out the fastest.

20:26.298 --> 20:28.332
The results are in.

20:28.333 --> 20:30.534
We have burned
eight kinds of fabric,

20:30.535 --> 20:32.569
Gotten eight
different burn times,

20:32.570 --> 20:35.537
And the winner, it turns out,
is a tie at 15 seconds.

20:35.538 --> 20:39.907
The fastest-burning fabrics
are both acrylic and fleece.

20:39.908 --> 20:42.143
Robert,
tell them what they've won.

20:42.144 --> 20:43.410
Thanks, Adam.

20:43.411 --> 20:45.845
Yes, today's two fabrics
both win the chance

20:45.846 --> 20:47.947
To return to the game
as real shirts,

20:47.948 --> 20:50.349
Then get burned
right down to their buttons

20:50.350 --> 20:52.151
In a winner-takes-all
torch time trial.

20:52.152 --> 20:53.585
Back to you, Adam.

20:53.586 --> 20:57.422
In order to do that, I'm going
to call upon all the skills

20:57.423 --> 21:00.525
I remember from home economics
in 4th and 5th grade

21:00.526 --> 21:02.026
With Miss Cavinitis.

21:02.027 --> 21:04.328
I still remember
a couple things.

21:04.329 --> 21:06.129
Adam's not showing off.

21:06.130 --> 21:09.165
We just couldn't buy
a plaid fleece shirt.

21:09.166 --> 21:11.867
So this is a home-spun
savage original.

21:11.868 --> 21:15.637
But he will need some torsos
to hang his designs on.

21:15.638 --> 21:18.205
That's where this guy comes in,
because I'm going to make

21:18.206 --> 21:20.574
A wire mannequin
that looks roughly like this

21:20.575 --> 21:23.276
So we have something
to hang them on while they burn.

21:23.277 --> 21:25.478
In just a few minutes,

21:25.479 --> 21:28.047
They both finish flirting
with fashion,

21:28.048 --> 21:31.049
And they both seem enamored
with their efforts.

21:33.352 --> 21:34.619
Show Jamie my threads.

21:34.620 --> 21:36.922
Check it out.

21:36.923 --> 21:39.091
Uh, who's your tailor, dude?

21:39.092 --> 21:42.060
I am my tailor.

21:42.061 --> 21:44.761
Hey, these
are one-time use.

21:44.762 --> 21:46.729
These guys look great.

21:46.730 --> 21:49.664
Meet Bernie and his
little brother, Crispin.

21:49.665 --> 21:52.698
So Bernie and Crispin
get shirted up --

21:52.699 --> 21:55.633
One with a plaid
that's all acrylic

21:55.634 --> 21:57.835
And the other made
from so-called fleece,

21:57.836 --> 22:01.639
Another synthetic that's partly
made from recycled plastic.

22:01.640 --> 22:07.043
The boys are eager to learn just
how combustible a shirt can be.

22:07.044 --> 22:10.479
Both shirts are lit from the
same point at the same time.

22:10.480 --> 22:11.981
All right, now,
the acrylic really seems

22:11.982 --> 22:13.550
To be winning by a fair bit.

22:13.551 --> 22:15.920
It's much more aggressive.

22:15.921 --> 22:17.722
Indeed.

22:17.723 --> 22:19.090
With no pepper spray,

22:19.091 --> 22:22.093
Both shirts burn slowly
but consistently.

22:22.094 --> 22:25.429
Adam, of course,
has a vested interest.

22:25.430 --> 22:27.430
Come on, fleece --
after all our training,

22:27.431 --> 22:29.399
After all our discussion,
is that all you got?

22:29.400 --> 22:31.300
You're gonna let acrylic
take you to town?

22:31.301 --> 22:32.768
You're gonna let him
show you up?

22:32.769 --> 22:34.069
Put something into it, man.

22:34.070 --> 22:35.971
But he's backed
the wrong blouse.

22:35.972 --> 22:40.307
Eventually, the acrylic is the
first one to give up the ghost.

22:40.308 --> 22:41.575
I'm gonna call it.

22:41.576 --> 22:44.744
8:25 --

22:44.745 --> 22:46.978
The acrylic is
completely burnt up,

22:46.979 --> 22:48.880
To a crisp,

22:48.881 --> 22:52.449
And the fleece still has
more than halfway to go.

22:52.450 --> 22:53.750
Yep.

22:53.751 --> 22:56.686
So, acrylic it is,
and here's the upshot.

22:56.687 --> 23:01.790
Shirts do burn, stun guns
can make a big spark,

23:01.791 --> 23:04.293
And some pepper sprays
are totally flammable.

23:04.294 --> 23:05.927
Now all that remains

23:05.928 --> 23:08.363
Is to pull these best-case
combustibles together

23:08.364 --> 23:10.364
To see if they can really make

23:10.365 --> 23:13.534
That instantaneous
human fireball.

23:16.130 --> 23:18.264
Don't try anything you've seen
on this show at home.

23:18.265 --> 23:19.632
We are what you call...
Experts.

23:24.048 --> 23:25.716
All right, so,
according to the tests,

23:25.717 --> 23:27.550
We are gonna need a lot
of these fireworks

23:27.551 --> 23:29.418
To get this guy off the ground.

23:29.419 --> 23:31.988
But the toughest part is
getting all those rockets

23:31.989 --> 23:33.122
To ignite at the same time.

23:33.123 --> 23:34.456
And how were they
attached to him?

23:34.457 --> 23:35.891
What kind of rig are we
talking about here?

23:35.892 --> 23:37.526
Again, the details are vague.

23:37.527 --> 23:39.895
We do know that he launched
himself off a ramp,

23:39.896 --> 23:41.697
But there's
no other information.

23:41.698 --> 23:43.966
All right. Well, then,
why don't we do this?

23:43.967 --> 23:46.034
We'll each come up with our own
design, small-scale,

23:46.035 --> 23:47.569
We'll attach
an action figure to it,

23:47.570 --> 23:48.803
And we'll launch him
off the ramp,

23:48.804 --> 23:50.436
And we'll see which one
has the best launch

23:50.437 --> 23:52.069
And which one has
the best flight pattern.

23:52.070 --> 23:54.271
So, in this workshop arena,

23:54.272 --> 23:57.440
Three specialist craftsmen
go head-to-head.

24:02.245 --> 24:06.048
They have just one hour
to whip up a workable prototype.

24:06.049 --> 24:09.585
So, let the games begin.

24:09.586 --> 24:11.953
Each contestant gets
two basic ingredients --

24:11.954 --> 24:16.758
One raw mini-buster
and one sprig of skyrockets.

24:16.759 --> 24:18.593
The winning design is the one

24:18.594 --> 24:21.629
That can best launch the doll
from a miniature ramp.

24:21.630 --> 24:24.532
Okay, so, my idea is

24:24.533 --> 24:27.532
A giant christmas-tree-shaped
fireworks cluster.

24:27.533 --> 24:30.232
I mean, what is more directional
than an arrow, huh?

24:30.233 --> 24:33.101
So all the thrust is
gonna go down this way,

24:33.102 --> 24:36.003
And the guy's gonna go...
Whoosh...Straight out.

24:36.004 --> 24:38.505
The only problem is making sure

24:38.506 --> 24:41.473
That the exhaust
from all the fireworks

24:41.474 --> 24:42.774
Doesn't burn him to a crisp.

24:42.775 --> 24:44.443
I'll work that out later.

24:44.444 --> 24:46.544
Yeah. Good luck with that.

24:46.545 --> 24:47.645
Meantime...

24:47.646 --> 24:49.012
That's the outfit.

24:49.013 --> 24:51.481
Now, my design for fireworks man
is very simple.

24:51.482 --> 24:53.449
It's basically taking
a set of wings

24:53.450 --> 24:55.017
And attaching them to his back.

24:55.018 --> 24:57.586
And then down the wing,
I'll be attaching rockets.

24:57.587 --> 25:00.921
And when I launch that off,
hopefully it'll act like a jet.

25:00.922 --> 25:03.856
Only thing is I hope these guys
can keep up with my pace.

25:03.857 --> 25:06.425
But we still
haven't heard from Kari.

25:06.426 --> 25:08.391
Essentially, this is my design.

25:08.392 --> 25:10.292
We have rockets
shooting out the back,

25:10.293 --> 25:11.660
A big wing for stabilization,

25:11.661 --> 25:13.929
Comfortable pillow
for my guy to lay on,

25:13.930 --> 25:15.664
And a skateboard

25:15.665 --> 25:17.866
That's going to reduce
the resistance up the ramp.

25:17.867 --> 25:19.302
Now, I think the best part
of my design

25:19.303 --> 25:20.573
Is that I've created a flashpan

25:20.574 --> 25:22.711
That's going to ignite
all of my rockets at once,

25:22.712 --> 25:24.615
Because simultaneous ignition
is something

25:24.616 --> 25:27.652
That we've always had trouble
with on "Mythbusters."

25:27.653 --> 25:30.088
While Kari and Grant
push on with their plans,

25:30.089 --> 25:33.791
There's been a small sensation
over at team Tory.

25:33.792 --> 25:37.258
He's decided to scrap his design
and go with a new one.

25:37.259 --> 25:40.593
I really wish that I had
come up with Tory's design

25:40.594 --> 25:43.193
Just 'cause
I'm a big "Star Wars" fan

25:43.194 --> 25:44.961
And it looks just like
an X-wing fighter.

25:44.962 --> 25:46.797
I know it was a little late
in the game

25:46.798 --> 25:48.565
To change the design
of firework man,

25:48.566 --> 25:52.602
But, you know...I think
this design is much better.

25:52.603 --> 25:53.936
The hour is up,

25:53.937 --> 25:55.971
And these
radically different designs

25:55.972 --> 25:57.606
Are about to be put to the test.

25:57.607 --> 26:01.143
3, 2, 1, and stop.

26:01.144 --> 26:03.678
Done.
Done.

26:03.679 --> 26:05.279
Let's see them.

26:05.280 --> 26:06.413
All right.

26:08.883 --> 26:11.651
Oh, are you ready to put your
rockets where your mouth is?

26:11.652 --> 26:13.185
Bring it.
Let's launch them.

26:13.186 --> 26:15.787
All right.
Get ready to lose, you guys.

26:15.788 --> 26:17.121
Just like Adam and Jamie,

26:17.122 --> 26:18.589
They're testing
at treasure island

26:18.590 --> 26:20.190
Under the Bay bridge.

26:20.191 --> 26:22.458
They're aiming to see
which design

26:22.459 --> 26:23.793
Has the best flight path

26:23.794 --> 26:25.995
And which one
flies the farthest.

26:25.996 --> 26:28.930
For that, they'll need
to stake out their turf.

26:28.931 --> 26:31.832
That might be
a little presumptuous.

26:31.833 --> 26:34.434
Given the strength
of the mini rockets,

26:34.435 --> 26:37.703
200 feet might be
a tad optimistic.

26:37.704 --> 26:40.005
Now, for that occur,
two things have to happen.

26:40.006 --> 26:43.374
One, we have to have
straight and stable flight.

26:43.375 --> 26:46.646
Two, we have to not explode
on the launch pad.

26:46.647 --> 26:49.448
Two very good points.

26:49.449 --> 26:51.650
And Tory's the first
to test his luck.

26:51.651 --> 26:54.586
I have trays of black powder
at each bundle of fireworks.

26:54.587 --> 26:56.387
I'm using an electric ignitor
to light off

26:56.388 --> 26:58.755
Each of those trays
of black powder.

26:58.756 --> 27:01.123
Once I hit the button,
all rockets should fire

27:01.124 --> 27:03.092
At the exact same time.

27:03.093 --> 27:05.727
In 3, 2, 1.

27:05.728 --> 27:07.862
- Whoo!
- Wow!

27:07.863 --> 27:09.630
It did something.

27:09.631 --> 27:12.933
I think it exploded
on the launch pad.

27:12.934 --> 27:15.869
The x-wing aircraft
went pretty much nowhere.

27:15.870 --> 27:19.339
But the pilot covered some
fair piece of real estate.

27:19.340 --> 27:21.641
Tory's launch was awesome,

27:21.642 --> 27:24.810
Mostly because I can't
even tell what happened.

27:24.811 --> 27:27.779
And the guy ended up
with his butt burned up

27:27.780 --> 27:31.082
Over on the lawn in a totally
different direction.

27:31.083 --> 27:34.018
Now, there's a piece
of my fireworks rocket.

27:34.019 --> 27:36.353
There's another piece.
Talk about epic fail.

27:36.354 --> 27:41.123
Not only did it crash and burn,
it exploded into pieces.

27:41.124 --> 27:43.892
Time for the next
fledgling to test her wings.

27:43.893 --> 27:46.494
But it's Grant
who makes the prediction.

27:46.495 --> 27:49.697
And if you pick up
her "flight vehicle,"

27:49.698 --> 27:52.300
It's a little back-heavy,
actually.

27:52.301 --> 27:55.937
So it could end up
sort of doing --

27:55.938 --> 27:57.672
I think it's actually gonna do
a loop-the-loop,

27:57.673 --> 27:59.607
As a matter of fact.

28:00.742 --> 28:02.876
Hold on, little missy.

28:02.877 --> 28:08.179
Fireworks man, Kari design,
small-scale, in 3, 2, 1.

28:09.181 --> 28:12.282
Holy...Wow!
Whoa.

28:12.283 --> 28:14.717
Whoo-hoo!

28:16.953 --> 28:18.519
Well, if we wanted something

28:18.520 --> 28:20.954
To go across the surface
really quickly,

28:20.955 --> 28:21.954
We got it.

28:21.955 --> 28:24.290
That was spectacular.
Oh, my God.

28:24.291 --> 28:27.830
It didn't fly high,
but it did fly straight,

28:27.831 --> 28:32.068
And every bit of that unlikely
apparatus left the ramp.

28:32.069 --> 28:35.204
As for the added sparkles,
nice touch.

28:35.205 --> 28:37.039
My guy isn't charred.

28:37.040 --> 28:38.840
We had a perfect ignition.

28:38.841 --> 28:41.643
We had a pretty good distance.

28:41.644 --> 28:43.077
So maybe if I had longer wings,

28:43.078 --> 28:45.079
This would have been
a perfect flight.

28:45.080 --> 28:47.814
I think I might actually have
the winning design here.

28:47.815 --> 28:51.017
But we're yet to see
Grant's design take to the air,

28:51.018 --> 28:53.752
And he's suffering
from preflight nerves.

28:53.753 --> 28:56.387
Okay. Here's my biggest fear.

28:56.388 --> 28:58.655
Instead of going on
this nice ballistic trajectory

28:58.656 --> 28:59.923
Out that way,

28:59.924 --> 29:02.292
It goes...Whoosh, sss...

29:02.293 --> 29:04.893
And comes right back at us.

29:04.894 --> 29:08.266
If I see that happen,
I'm hitting the deck.

29:08.267 --> 29:10.334
Okay. Good luck.

29:10.335 --> 29:12.102
When even the experts
are scared,

29:12.103 --> 29:15.805
It's probably wise
to duck and cover.

29:15.806 --> 29:18.240
In 3, 2, 1.

29:23.412 --> 29:25.912
Grant's launch looked

29:25.913 --> 29:28.347
More like a guy
slipping on soap.

29:28.348 --> 29:29.681
Whoa!

29:29.682 --> 29:32.416
So there's no real need
for a high-speed replay.

29:32.417 --> 29:33.717
But let's do it anyway.

29:33.718 --> 29:34.252
This one barely mad

29:34.253 --> 29:37.457
It but let's do it anyway.
Off the launch pad,

29:37.458 --> 29:38.992
Did not achieve flight,

29:38.993 --> 29:41.429
Could not get
simultaneous ignition,

29:41.430 --> 29:43.398
And, therefore,
has to be rejected.

29:43.399 --> 29:46.433
Whoo! Ohh!

29:46.434 --> 29:48.702
So the winning design
is clearly Kari's.

29:48.703 --> 29:52.172
In the end, this is
the design we're going with.

29:52.173 --> 29:55.308
We have one bank of fireworks
that all ignite simultaneously.

29:55.309 --> 29:56.875
We have a heat shield

29:56.876 --> 29:58.809
That keeps our little driver
from getting fried.

29:58.810 --> 30:00.644
And the wing created
enough stability

30:00.645 --> 30:02.246
To get us a nice, short flight.

30:02.247 --> 30:04.882
Now, I think if we increase
the length of the wing,

30:04.883 --> 30:09.286
We'll get more stability and
maybe get a perfect trajectory.

30:16.932 --> 30:19.084
After days of experimentation,

30:19.085 --> 30:21.952
Adam and Jamie are finally ready
to test the myth

30:21.953 --> 30:24.822
Of the "CSI" stun gun.

30:25.454 --> 30:27.921
This fine specimen
of manhood here

30:27.922 --> 30:30.756
Will soon be our perp
for our final test.

30:30.757 --> 30:32.524
Now, in order to be
a proper perp,

30:32.525 --> 30:34.259
I needed to have
conductive skin.

30:34.260 --> 30:37.662
So I'm gonna give him
a layer of foam,

30:37.663 --> 30:39.964
And then I'm going to cover
that foam with foil,

30:39.965 --> 30:42.366
And that foil will act
as the conductive skin

30:42.367 --> 30:43.934
That hopefully will give us
the spark

30:43.935 --> 30:46.135
To light our perp on fire.

30:46.136 --> 30:48.671
He's ready.

30:48.672 --> 30:51.639
And in hope
of a blazing conclusion,

30:51.640 --> 30:53.474
It's back to treasure island.

30:53.475 --> 30:55.241
The methodology here is
actually pretty simple.

30:55.242 --> 30:57.909
Our perp here is dressed
in the latest fashion --

30:57.910 --> 31:00.778
The acrylic shirt that we found
the most flammable.

31:00.779 --> 31:02.646
We are going to spray him down

31:02.647 --> 31:05.282
With the pepper spray we found
most flammable -- number 4.

31:05.283 --> 31:08.051
And then I am going to stand
back with this stun gun...

31:09.053 --> 31:10.554
...And pop him
right in the chest

31:10.555 --> 31:13.124
And see if he bursts
into flames.

31:13.125 --> 31:14.625
All right.
Stand clear.

31:14.626 --> 31:16.626
So, confirming the myth

31:16.627 --> 31:18.594
Of an instant, massive fireball

31:18.595 --> 31:21.163
All comes down to this.

31:21.164 --> 31:23.432
Just like they did on "CSI,"

31:23.433 --> 31:25.333
Adam unloads
for a good few seconds.

31:25.334 --> 31:27.435
Freeze!

31:28.837 --> 31:32.339
Hey!

31:32.340 --> 31:35.441
Dude!
It's burning.

31:35.442 --> 31:39.545
I totally -- wow!
He's totally burning.

31:40.714 --> 31:43.915
And we totally need
the fire extinguisher.

31:46.117 --> 31:48.652
You have the right
to not be on fire.

31:48.653 --> 31:49.886
Anything you burn

31:49.887 --> 31:52.722
Can and will be held against you
in a court of law.

31:52.723 --> 31:55.891
But do we have the right
to call this confirmed?

31:55.892 --> 31:59.093
Of course, it wasn't
quite the big fireball

31:59.094 --> 32:00.495
That we saw on "CSI."

32:00.496 --> 32:02.797
* I'm on fire *

32:02.798 --> 32:04.364
But this being "Mythbusters,"

32:04.365 --> 32:06.733
We're gonna do our darndest
to get one.

32:06.734 --> 32:09.235
So they postpone the judgment,

32:09.236 --> 32:13.338
Discharging four whole cans
on a backup acrylic shirt.

32:13.339 --> 32:15.841
Think that's enough?
No.

32:17.177 --> 32:22.446
Just for good measure,
Jamie almost doubles the dose.

32:22.447 --> 32:25.048
All right.

32:25.049 --> 32:26.482
Freeze!

32:28.819 --> 32:30.586
Nice!

32:30.587 --> 32:33.288
Yeah.

32:33.289 --> 32:34.956
Now that's really close

32:34.957 --> 32:37.857
To the human bonfire
we saw on tv.

32:37.858 --> 32:38.958
There's your fireball.

32:40.794 --> 32:43.663
It's instantaneous.
Look at that.

32:43.664 --> 32:46.633
Yeah. Might as well have lit it
with a match.

32:46.634 --> 32:48.002
Unbelievable.

32:48.003 --> 32:50.571
It's a fabulous fireball,

32:50.572 --> 32:55.075
But in this case, they did use
an ocean of pepper spray.

32:57.278 --> 32:59.044
So, how do we want
to call this one?

32:59.045 --> 33:00.445
Well, let's do a little math.

33:00.446 --> 33:04.548
One acrylic shirt plus a can
of flammable pepper spray

33:04.549 --> 33:07.117
Plus one stun gun equals...

33:07.118 --> 33:08.551
Plausible.

33:08.552 --> 33:09.686
I agree.

33:09.687 --> 33:11.188
One acrylic shirt
plus a stun gun

33:11.189 --> 33:14.457
Plus a whole crapload
of pepper spray equals...

33:14.458 --> 33:16.025
Gratuitous.

33:16.026 --> 33:18.126
That's our favorite
four-syllable word.

33:18.127 --> 33:20.430
So the verdict on this myth
is plausible.

33:20.431 --> 33:22.365
But we're not done yet.

33:22.366 --> 33:25.601
Jamie's determined to end
with a serious spectacle.

33:25.602 --> 33:28.203
And believe me,
you don't want to miss this.

33:30.000 --> 33:36.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

33:37.278 --> 33:38.812
Okay, so,
we're back in the shop

33:38.813 --> 33:40.346
After our
small-scale experiment.

33:40.347 --> 33:42.648
The myth that we're testing
is that some crazy German

33:42.649 --> 33:46.119
Thought it was a great idea to
strap 400 fireworks to himself,

33:46.120 --> 33:48.721
Propel himself off a ramp
into a lake.

33:48.722 --> 33:51.790
So, it is gonna take 400
of our homemade skyrockets

33:51.791 --> 33:53.692
To launch our fireworks man.

33:53.693 --> 33:55.862
Now the big challenge
of this design

33:55.863 --> 33:57.730
Is to attach all 400 together

33:57.731 --> 34:01.367
And to get them to go off
at the same exact time.

34:01.368 --> 34:03.468
And I'll be attaching
a new and improved wing design

34:03.469 --> 34:06.337
Which should help with the one
flaw from my small-scale,

34:06.338 --> 34:09.440
Which is spinning
out of control.

34:09.440 --> 34:10.841
Whoo-hoo!
Whoo!

34:10.842 --> 34:12.576
And they figured the best way

34:12.577 --> 34:14.277
To minimize friction
on the ramp

34:14.277 --> 34:15.978
Is to hook two skateboards

34:15.978 --> 34:18.414
Up to a shiny,
slippery metal rail.

34:18.415 --> 34:20.583
I can't stop.

34:20.583 --> 34:22.083
Aah!

34:22.085 --> 34:23.319
Ohh.

34:23.320 --> 34:25.286
Are you okay?
Yes.

34:25.286 --> 34:26.721
Dude, you got to be careful.

34:28.190 --> 34:31.259
Now, why a skateboard, you ask?

34:31.260 --> 34:34.695
Well, this was
clearly not some sort

34:34.696 --> 34:36.396
Of highly engineered
NASA launch.

34:36.397 --> 34:39.264
This is a guy that strapped
a bunch of fireworks to himself.

34:39.266 --> 34:42.201
And if you're in that mind-set,
what are you gonna use?

34:42.202 --> 34:45.103
You're gonna use some
sort of fancy system?

34:45.105 --> 34:47.973
No. You're probably gonna use
a skateboard.

34:47.974 --> 34:51.007
Now, for the sled, I came
up with something interesting.

34:51.009 --> 34:53.510
A surfboard.
It serves two purposes.

34:53.511 --> 34:55.312
For one, it's really light.

34:55.313 --> 34:58.815
It's not gonna add a lot
of weight to our contraption.

34:58.816 --> 35:01.817
And number two --
we're launching, hopefully,

35:01.818 --> 35:03.052
All the way into a lake,

35:03.053 --> 35:04.753
And retrieving
all of our rockets

35:04.754 --> 35:07.255
Would be a pain in the butt
if our whole thing sank,

35:07.256 --> 35:09.757
So...It's made of styrofoam.

35:09.758 --> 35:11.591
This thing floats.

35:11.592 --> 35:15.262
So, while the team gets
very, very busy with the building --

35:15.263 --> 35:16.630
Kari with these new wings

35:16.631 --> 35:18.865
And Grant
with some stabilizing fins --

35:18.866 --> 35:21.634
Tory gets to play with fire.

35:21.635 --> 35:24.203
So, I've removed
the sticks from the skyrockets,

35:24.204 --> 35:26.839
And I've glued together
banks of 100.

35:26.840 --> 35:28.340
Now that they're
all glued together,

35:28.341 --> 35:30.208
What I'm gonna do is cut grooves
on the table saw

35:30.209 --> 35:31.709
Through the nozzle area.

35:31.710 --> 35:35.713
That way, these grooves will be
filled up with black powder.

35:35.714 --> 35:39.049
And when I fill this whole thing up
with black powder and ignite it,

35:39.050 --> 35:42.618
The flame will move through
the grooves into the nozzles

35:42.619 --> 35:47.255
And ignite all the rockets
at the same exact time.

35:47.256 --> 35:51.091
And there's no time
to test Tory's groove

35:51.092 --> 35:52.359
Like the present.

35:52.360 --> 35:54.961
In 3, 2, 1.

35:58.466 --> 35:59.999
Yeah!

36:00.000 --> 36:03.702
Oh! That looked
so synchronized.

36:03.703 --> 36:06.005
Whoo-hoo!

36:06.006 --> 36:07.539
Wow.

36:07.540 --> 36:09.040
That was synchronized.

36:09.041 --> 36:11.341
That is
a beautiful ignition system.

36:11.342 --> 36:13.476
I see good things
in our future.

36:13.477 --> 36:14.878
Back inside,

36:14.879 --> 36:17.746
The wings, the fins,
and the skateboard rail

36:17.747 --> 36:20.413
Are the key additions
to our makeshift vehicle

36:20.414 --> 36:25.050
That just might launch
a stand-in man 150 feet.

36:25.051 --> 36:27.119
And it's probably just as well

36:27.120 --> 36:28.787
He's missing the back
of his head.

36:28.788 --> 36:30.889
If all of our calculations
are correct,

36:30.890 --> 36:33.191
We should see this fireworks man

36:33.192 --> 36:35.226
Fly up that ramp
and across the lake.

36:35.227 --> 36:38.495
Or it's gonna fail miserably
and explode on the ramp.

36:44.879 --> 36:47.733
With the myth of the "CSI" stun gun wrapped up,

36:47.870 --> 36:49.503
The boys feel the need
to go out

36:49.504 --> 36:53.039
In a totally gratuitous
blaze of glory.

36:53.040 --> 36:57.209
Jamie left me this really
cryptic message which said only,

36:57.210 --> 37:00.746
Bring him a burnable perp
and dress for a fire.

37:02.282 --> 37:05.717
I am, as they say, intrigued.

37:05.718 --> 37:07.219
Here we go.

37:07.220 --> 37:10.222
Adam dresses his man
in a fitting fashion.

37:10.223 --> 37:14.058
And the shirt, as you've
guessed, is the famous flannel.

37:14.059 --> 37:16.928
Ah. Are you ready,
little buddy?

37:19.197 --> 37:21.363
This is actually
the standard model of robot

37:21.364 --> 37:23.763
That are all of Grant's servants
back at his castle.

37:36.441 --> 37:39.943
So, the savage
awaits the barbarian.

37:39.944 --> 37:42.211
And Jamie's weapon of choice

37:42.212 --> 37:46.348
Is a vintage vietnam-era
gasoline flamethrower.

37:46.349 --> 37:48.283
Ah, hey.
What do you got?

37:48.284 --> 37:50.051
Stand clear.
I'm going hot.

37:50.052 --> 37:51.519
Okay.

37:56.490 --> 37:58.991
Long-time viewers know
that sometimes,

37:58.992 --> 38:02.261
When a myth falls frustratingly
short of confirmation...

38:02.262 --> 38:03.795
You see any bullet holes?

38:03.796 --> 38:05.397
I don't see any at all.
No.

38:05.398 --> 38:06.564
...We like to, uh...

38:06.565 --> 38:08.099
Firing.

38:08.100 --> 38:09.867
...Turn it up a notch or 10.

38:13.271 --> 38:15.738
Once again, Jamie's ready
to skip the method

38:15.739 --> 38:17.373
And go straight for the mayhem.

38:18.808 --> 38:22.210
3, 2, 1.

38:27.349 --> 38:30.584
There's no better way
to unleash hell

38:30.585 --> 38:31.785
Than a 60-foot flame.

38:37.990 --> 38:39.824
Nice!

38:48.799 --> 38:51.367
That's what I'm talking about.

38:54.804 --> 38:56.738
Very post-apocalyptic
of you.

38:56.739 --> 38:58.439
Is that hot enough for you?

38:58.440 --> 39:02.043
Well, that was only ever going
to end one way.

39:02.044 --> 39:03.810
And thanks to a $5 shirt,

39:03.811 --> 39:05.612
We've got
a million-dollar memory.

39:16.723 --> 39:19.490
Any kid who's ever read
a comic book

39:19.491 --> 39:22.192
Has surely dreamed
of personal rocket propulsion.

39:22.193 --> 39:23.661
According to fans,

39:23.662 --> 39:27.897
One man actually flew 150 feet
with skyrockets,

39:27.898 --> 39:30.133
So we had to see for ourselves.

39:30.134 --> 39:34.003
We've studied the physics, built
the best amateur rig we could,

39:34.004 --> 39:36.638
And found a flooded quarry
for the crash landing.

39:36.639 --> 39:39.007
Oh, this place is cool.

39:39.008 --> 39:40.841
Whoa!

39:40.842 --> 39:43.911
Already dangerous.

39:43.912 --> 39:46.246
So, if our math is correct

39:46.247 --> 39:47.914
And our fireworks
do what they're supposed to,

39:47.915 --> 39:51.049
We should get a man landing
in the lake any time now.

39:51.050 --> 39:53.284
Ooh. Nice.

39:53.285 --> 39:55.419
He's got to not explode
on the launch pad,

39:55.420 --> 39:57.119
Have a stable flight,

39:57.120 --> 40:01.322
And, according to the myth,
fly at least 150 feet.

40:01.323 --> 40:03.056
I hope he does it.

40:03.057 --> 40:06.425
Now to check
on correct starting weight.

40:06.426 --> 40:08.259
All right.
How much does he weigh?

40:08.260 --> 40:09.827
Okay.

40:09.828 --> 40:11.795
183.

40:11.796 --> 40:13.999
Well, the sled weighs 60,
so that makes him 243.

40:14.000 --> 40:17.336
That's perfect. That's exactly
around what we need.

40:17.337 --> 40:18.371
All right.

40:18.372 --> 40:20.907
Load him up.
Let's do this.

40:20.908 --> 40:24.410
Kari and Grant
fit skateboards to rails

40:24.411 --> 40:27.646
For a hopefully
friction-free ride,

40:27.647 --> 40:29.414
While Tory sets the charge

40:29.415 --> 40:32.517
To ignite every last one
of those 400 rockets.

40:32.518 --> 40:36.153
Fingers crossed,
they will launch together.

40:36.154 --> 40:38.955
Now, I know this might not seem
like a lot of black powder,

40:38.956 --> 40:40.490
But I'm actually using 6 ounces.

40:40.491 --> 40:43.092
I mean, that would be plenty
to fire off a cannonball.

40:43.093 --> 40:45.360
So the fuses are fixed,

40:45.361 --> 40:47.062
And the very last bits
of the puzzle

40:47.063 --> 40:49.799
Slide neatly enough into place.

40:49.800 --> 40:51.633
You're like a surgeon
with that thing.

40:53.035 --> 40:55.436
Do you guys realize
this is a dream come true?

40:55.437 --> 40:56.670
I think for all of us.

40:56.671 --> 40:58.004
It's a thing of beauty.

40:58.005 --> 41:00.405
But let's remember
that fireworks man

41:00.406 --> 41:02.740
Still has a hell of a lot
to live up to.

41:02.741 --> 41:06.076
For this myth to be possible,
we need two things to happen.

41:06.077 --> 41:10.046
One, we need Buster to launch
off that ramp and hit the water.

41:10.047 --> 41:12.448
And two, we need him to not be

41:12.449 --> 41:15.352
A burning mass
of melting Buster.

41:15.353 --> 41:17.154
You can bet your bionic britches

41:17.155 --> 41:19.858
That Buster's in full agreement.

41:19.859 --> 41:22.862
We're all wired up,
ready to go.

41:22.863 --> 41:27.899
This is fireworks man
in 3, 2, 1.

41:39.610 --> 41:42.845
We got a launch.
It's still going. Look.

41:44.248 --> 41:46.348
From the shore,

41:46.349 --> 41:49.184
It's a dazzling display
of smoke and sparkles,

41:49.185 --> 41:51.919
But just put yourself
in Buster's shoes.

41:57.559 --> 42:00.327
It was looking so good.

42:00.328 --> 42:01.762
We got a perfect launch.

42:01.763 --> 42:04.630
He was going up the ramp,
he gets to the top of the ramp,

42:04.631 --> 42:07.733
And that's where everything
goes all wrong.

42:07.734 --> 42:11.370
In fact,
it's the good, the bad,

42:11.371 --> 42:13.505
The ugly, and the awesome

42:13.506 --> 42:16.874
All in one amazing launch.

42:16.875 --> 42:19.076
As Buster gets dragged
from the drink...

42:19.077 --> 42:21.111
Hi.

42:21.112 --> 42:24.013
...It's time to reflect
on what worked and what didn't.

42:24.014 --> 42:26.382
So, we got
simultaneous ignition,

42:26.383 --> 42:27.883
We used actual fireworks,

42:27.884 --> 42:30.451
He made it off the ramp
and into the water.

42:30.452 --> 42:33.487
Yeah, and on top of that, he
didn't catch on fire or explode,

42:33.488 --> 42:35.857
Which means he would have
survived the launch.

42:35.858 --> 42:37.525
Well, he might have
survived the launch,

42:37.526 --> 42:39.160
But I'm not so sure
about the landing.

42:39.161 --> 42:41.228
And we didn't fulfill all
the criteria of the myth.

42:41.229 --> 42:43.330
I mean, he did not go
the 150 feet we talked about.

42:43.331 --> 42:45.465
It's one
of the toughest decisions

42:45.466 --> 42:47.233
They've ever been faced with.

42:47.234 --> 42:49.135
On the one hand,

42:49.136 --> 42:52.204
It was really only those loose
legs tipping the sled backwards

42:52.205 --> 42:53.772
That spoiled the party.

42:53.773 --> 42:57.012
On the other hand,
Buster only flew 30 feet,

42:57.188 --> 42:59.889
And there's no doubt
that the yahoo in the myth

42:59.890 --> 43:03.625
Went to way less trouble than
we did with far fewer resources.

43:03.626 --> 43:07.763
So, with regret, that's where
we're drawing the line.

43:07.764 --> 43:10.030
So, I think we're still gonna
have to call this one busted.

43:10.031 --> 43:11.531
All right. Busted.

43:11.532 --> 43:13.132
Busted.

43:13.133 --> 43:14.867
But, man, what a way
to bust a myth.

43:14.868 --> 43:15.901
Right.

43:23.475 --> 43:24.224
Want more?

43:24.225 --> 43:27.907
