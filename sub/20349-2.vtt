Hey, ma'am, I think somebody's coming.

Oh. Uh-oh.

Oh!

- Gary.

00:31.532 --> 00:33.702
President Stevenson!

00:33.743 --> 00:36.083
Enjoying a stroll down memory lane?

00:36.120 --> 00:38.120
Well, I'll tell you something,
if this were my library,

00:38.164 --> 00:40.874
I would make sure the people
could sit behind the desk.

00:40.916 --> 00:43.126
Can you even have a library?

00:43.169 --> 00:47.299
Seems like it'd be more
like a bookmobile.

00:50.885 --> 00:53.385
- Yeah.
- Oh, my goodness, you're so funny!

00:53.429 --> 00:56.679
If only the American people could've
known you for your sense of humor

00:56.724 --> 00:59.854
instead of your bizarre
indifference to apartheid.

00:59.894 --> 01:01.314
President Stevenson.

01:01.353 --> 01:03.853
- Ah, Mr. Splett.
- Ma'am, I found one.

01:03.898 --> 01:04.503
You found what?

01:04.504 --> 01:06.319
You told me to find all
the pictures of you.

01:06.358 --> 01:08.358
- I didn't say that.
- Is that your purse?

01:08.402 --> 01:11.402
No. Let's go and see what else
Hughes stole from the West Wing.

01:11.447 --> 01:13.817
You want to? I think we're
about to start this thing.

- sync and corrections by Mr. C -

01:19.163 --> 01:22.873
I don't understand how a guy who never
cracked a book can open up a library.

01:22.917 --> 01:24.577
Let me tell you something,

01:24.627 --> 01:26.497
Hughes literally grabbed this
chopper the day you left office.

01:26.545 --> 01:28.705
How they "Jewed him down,"
as Mother used to say

01:28.756 --> 01:31.376
when she wasn't busy telling me he
only picked me as a running mate

01:31.425 --> 01:32.625
so that he could look taller.

01:32.676 --> 01:35.296
Oh, my God. Supermodels are your height.

01:35.346 --> 01:37.466
It doesn't matter. She's dead.
Who cares?

01:37.515 --> 01:40.965
Hey, that reminds me, we need to find
a place for Andrew's desk upstairs.

01:41.018 --> 01:43.728
How is an ex-president's
ex moving back in with her

01:43.771 --> 01:45.731
gonna go over with small-town America?

01:45.773 --> 01:47.483
Unlike small-town America,

01:47.525 --> 01:49.725
Andrew fucks me in a way I really enjoy.

01:49.777 --> 01:51.737
- Oh, wow!
- Mm-hmm.

01:51.779 --> 01:53.029
MAN: <i>Ma'am, may I get one with
you and the first ladies?</i>

01:53.072 --> 01:55.112
Oh, absolutely!

01:55.157 --> 01:57.487
No Mrs. Hughes. She must be hanging
from the rafters somewhere.

01:57.535 --> 01:59.235
- Gale!
- Don't forget the first husbands.

01:59.286 --> 02:02.196
Madame President, you
look stunning in white.

02:02.248 --> 02:04.208
Where's <i> la presidenta?</i>

02:04.250 --> 02:07.250
I believe she is with President
Hughes and the other formers

02:07.294 --> 02:08.964
taking pictures in front
of Air Force One.

02:09.003 --> 02:10.253
Wait, that wasn't on the schedule.

02:10.297 --> 02:11.917
I think it was an impromptu thing.

02:11.966 --> 02:14.126
They just happened to be
chatting amongst themselves.

02:14.176 --> 02:16.716
Got it. So good to see you!

02:16.762 --> 02:18.052
Former fuckers.

02:18.097 --> 02:20.007
This is as impromptu as a colonoscopy

02:20.057 --> 02:22.057
except with quadruple the assholes.

02:22.101 --> 02:23.444
Are we running from
something scary, ma'am?

02:23.446 --> 02:23.892
No.

02:23.936 --> 02:25.976
Richard, you slow down. It'll
look like I'm not running.

02:26.021 --> 02:27.481
- Gary, you go fast.
- Yep!

02:27.523 --> 02:28.983
Oh, no, that's too fast.

02:30.693 --> 02:32.613
Okay, folks, listen up. (CLAPS)

02:34.154 --> 02:35.864
I want a library.

02:35.906 --> 02:37.816
(SIGHS) I guess I could give
up the gift wrapping room.

02:37.867 --> 02:40.157
No, no, no, I want a goddamn

02:40.202 --> 02:42.042
"look at the size of my dick,"

02:42.079 --> 02:44.869
"bring history to life"
presidential library.

02:44.915 --> 02:45.695
GARY: <i> Mm-hmm.</i>

02:45.697 --> 02:48.036
I'm the only living president
who doesn't have one.

02:48.085 --> 02:49.375
And you wanna know why that is?

02:49.420 --> 02:50.750
Because you served less than one year?

02:50.796 --> 02:54.506
No. Because nobody gives me any respect.

02:54.550 --> 02:56.680
I was a two-term senator.

02:56.719 --> 02:58.429
I was a congresswoman.

02:58.470 --> 02:59.890
- A mother.
- No!

02:59.930 --> 03:02.720
I was the first woman vice president.

03:02.766 --> 03:05.056
And America cannot forget that.

03:05.102 --> 03:06.182
Never forget.

03:06.228 --> 03:08.228
Oh, sorry, that's the Holocaust.

03:08.272 --> 03:10.692
- Totally forgot.
- I need a monument to Selina Meyer.

03:10.733 --> 03:14.993
- An institution.
- Selina Meyer belongs in an institution.

03:15.029 --> 03:16.739
- It was a spa.
- Let's do this!

03:16.780 --> 03:18.280
Oh, you know what? We're on an airplane.
I know that.

03:18.324 --> 03:20.034
What are you thinking
about for a location?

03:20.075 --> 03:21.865
- It's gonna be Yale.
- Oh.

03:21.911 --> 03:23.621
Yale has the prestige.

03:23.662 --> 03:25.122
And, boys, it's where
I went to law school.

03:25.164 --> 03:26.794
So, I mean, Yale's just perfect.

03:26.832 --> 03:29.002
Your outfits alone are gonna be a wing.

03:29.043 --> 03:30.963
- Dresses, belts...
- Now, look,

03:31.003 --> 03:32.713
I want you to start
lining up architects.

03:32.755 --> 03:35.835
I wanna talk to every Tom,
Dick, and Gehry out there.

03:35.883 --> 03:37.513
Maybe a female candidate.

03:37.551 --> 03:40.841
Well, we're not redoing a
kitchen, here, you know?

03:40.888 --> 03:44.388
And we need to tell them that the
Kennedy Library is a reference point

03:44.433 --> 03:46.143
'cause, you know, he was
also a part-termer.

03:46.185 --> 03:48.225
Right.

03:48.270 --> 03:50.480
<i>(MAN CHUCKLES) Can I bring anything?</i>

03:50.522 --> 03:53.232
Ah, don't bring a thing. I'm gonna
make my famous paella valenciana.

03:53.275 --> 03:56.185
We're looking forward to seeing you
and your lovely wife on Saturday.

03:56.236 --> 03:57.986
All right, can't be too safe.

03:58.030 --> 04:00.910
That sweaty pederast has ruined
more kids than the Common Core.

04:00.950 --> 04:02.990
Luckily, Will's anal halitosis

04:03.035 --> 04:04.865
renders him completely unbouffable.

04:04.912 --> 04:07.082
- Tell 'em why, Will.
- I'm fortunate to be odious

04:07.122 --> 04:08.752
to all colors of the sexual spectrum.

04:08.791 --> 04:11.921
So, what is it? Speak,
Professor X-Gayvier.

04:11.961 --> 04:14.631
Minority Leader Furlong, with
Congressman Shields' retirement,

04:14.672 --> 04:16.841
there is an empty seat
on Ways and Means, so...

04:16.882 --> 04:19.262
Yeah, let me save you the peanut
log you're about to squeeze

04:19.301 --> 04:21.680
out of your face anus here... no.

04:21.720 --> 04:23.720
You remain in detention
on the Ethics Committee

04:23.764 --> 04:25.644
with the rest of the
special ed Breakfast Club.

04:25.683 --> 04:27.983
Nobody in Congress cares about ethics.

04:28.018 --> 04:29.728
Jonah Ryan needs to make waves.

04:29.770 --> 04:32.690
- Dismissed, GI Slow.
- I'm free Saturday night.

04:32.731 --> 04:34.611
I am shocked.

04:34.650 --> 04:37.230
Good luck getting your precious back
from those mean hobbits, SmÃ©agol.

04:38.487 --> 04:40.567
- Uh, Kent.
- Will.

04:40.614 --> 04:44.244
I, uh... I'm so sorry, but,
you know, a job's a job.

04:44.284 --> 04:47.164
That's a false equivalence, but
I appreciate the sentiment.

04:47.204 --> 04:48.584
The first couple of years
are the toughest, but...

04:48.622 --> 04:50.912
- Kent!
- FURLONG: <i> Will!</i>

04:50.958 --> 04:53.208
<i>(MUSIC PLAYING)</i>

04:53.252 --> 04:55.502
- What is this music, ma'am?
- It's Brazilian music.

04:55.546 --> 04:58.046
- Andrew gave it to me.
- Ma'am, could you please stop dancing?

04:58.090 --> 05:00.260
'Cause I'm just... I'm framing
out your dress right now.

05:00.300 --> 05:03.050
You know, you're using an awful
lot of paint for down there.

05:03.095 --> 05:05.595
Maybe use it for up
here and focus on this.

05:05.639 --> 05:06.759
Oh, yeah, let's give the
people what they want.

05:06.807 --> 05:08.427
Okay, that's really...

05:08.475 --> 05:10.225
- I'm sorry, that was too much.
- way out of line.

05:10.269 --> 05:11.519
- (MOUTHING) But, yes.
- ANDREW: <i> Knock, knock.</i>

05:11.562 --> 05:12.982
Sorry to interrupt. Can we take five?

05:13.022 --> 05:15.272
Oh, uh, yeah. Sorry, Helen.

05:15.315 --> 05:18.065
Just five for a second. No,
Gary knows how to do this.

05:18.110 --> 05:19.990
- Okay, ma'am. Oh, sorry.
- What are you doing?

05:20.029 --> 05:21.699
God damn it, what is it?

05:21.739 --> 05:23.609
Lee, I've been rustling the bushes...

05:23.657 --> 05:25.907
- Yes?
- and it turns out that people are

05:25.951 --> 05:31.291
considerably more interested in your library
than they are in adult literacy or AIDS.

05:31.331 --> 05:33.121
Well, I guess AIDS had a good run.

05:33.167 --> 05:34.417
It did.

05:34.460 --> 05:38.550
Um, I have a Pakistani
industrialist friend

05:38.589 --> 05:40.879
who's interested in donating $20 million

05:40.924 --> 05:43.054
if you get his cousin
off the no-fly list.

05:43.093 --> 05:44.723
As long as he promises not
to blow up my library,

05:44.762 --> 05:46.142
I mean, I don't really give a shit.

05:46.180 --> 05:48.430
- Sure.
- Okay.

05:48.474 --> 05:48.974
Richard!

05:48.976 --> 05:50.475
I've been standing here
the entire time, ma'am.

05:50.517 --> 05:52.057
Just trying to keep still in
case I'm in the painting.

05:52.102 --> 05:53.232
No, you're not in the painting.
Come here.

05:53.270 --> 05:54.940
So, listen, in terms of the library,

05:54.980 --> 05:57.520
I really wanna have a
reflecting pool someplace

05:57.566 --> 05:59.356
for people to come and sit and reflect

05:59.401 --> 06:02.441
on what this cocksuck
of a country did to me.

06:02.488 --> 06:04.238
- My pen's just out of ink.
- Let's go.

06:04.281 --> 06:05.741
I'm gonna scratch it into the paper

06:05.783 --> 06:07.453
and then kind of go back
over and trace over

06:07.493 --> 06:09.163
and see what I wrote before,
like in a suspense movie.

06:09.203 --> 06:12.663
Also, we heard back from Yale and
their response was emphatic.

06:12.706 --> 06:14.326
- It's a no.
- (GARY GASPS)

06:16.919 --> 06:20.049
Okay, Helen, I'm so sorry. Can
we just take another five?

06:20.089 --> 06:23.339
Gary, I don't know why you
keep doing that because...

06:23.383 --> 06:25.803
Okay, just get back.

06:25.844 --> 06:28.514
What did Yale say? What
did they say exactly?

06:28.555 --> 06:31.255
They said the Sherman
Tanz pardon was unsavory

06:31.308 --> 06:33.478
and not in line with the values of Yale.

06:33.519 --> 06:36.019
Then they asked for a donation to their
annual fund. How much do we send?

06:36.063 --> 06:39.693
Okay, who else do we know that
went to Yale that can help us out?

06:39.733 --> 06:41.863
I did. I can call my RA.
We're still pretty close.

06:41.902 --> 06:43.612
Okay, well, that's, you know...

06:43.654 --> 06:45.244
Well, your undergrad alma
mater, Smith College,

06:45.280 --> 06:46.910
said they were open to exploring.

06:46.949 --> 06:49.199
Just like a Smith girl,
open to exploring.

06:49.243 --> 06:50.703
Lesbians would really know
how to run a library...

06:50.744 --> 06:52.794
You know, it might not be a bad idea.

06:52.830 --> 06:54.750
A woman president, women's college,

06:54.790 --> 06:56.000
three hours from New York.

06:56.041 --> 06:57.961
And the fall foliage is amazing!

06:58.001 --> 06:59.331
You know what, can I just say something?

06:59.378 --> 07:01.168
Fuck Yale University.

07:01.213 --> 07:03.843
- Fuck Yale.
- Yeah.

07:03.882 --> 07:05.355
I'm not really comfortable
with that kind of language.

07:05.357 --> 07:06.053
Fuck Yale University.

07:06.093 --> 07:07.933
- We're going with Smith.
- Ellen. Have you guys seen Ellen?

07:07.970 --> 07:09.890
- Who?
- My daughter.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.100
I had to bring her to work today,
and we're playing hide and seek,

07:11.140 --> 07:13.060
and now I can't find her.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.060
- I'm here, Mike! I'm going to hide again!
- Oh, shit!

07:15.102 --> 07:16.392
- Oh, my God.
- No, no, we're not hiding anymore.

07:16.436 --> 07:19.306
Oh, she's too much!

07:19.356 --> 07:21.566
How the fuck long was that kid here for?

07:21.608 --> 07:23.898
I think just since today,
but I can't be sure.

07:23.944 --> 07:25.494
We about done, you think?

07:25.529 --> 07:28.029
Well, we just got started, ma'am.

07:29.241 --> 07:30.701
What?

07:30.742 --> 07:32.332
It may look sunny,

07:32.369 --> 07:34.489
but with temperatures plunging
down into the single digits,

07:34.538 --> 07:37.458
the Coney Island Polar Bear Club is
really earning its name this year.

07:37.499 --> 07:39.079
<i>Hey, guys, wait for me!</i>

07:39.126 --> 07:40.746
- Yeah!
- (PEOPLE CHEERING)

07:40.794 --> 07:42.754
All right! Oh! (LAUGHING)

07:42.796 --> 07:44.666
<i>Oh, my God! God, that's cold!</i>

07:44.715 --> 07:47.835
- It's great, right?
- I don't think this is working.

07:47.885 --> 07:51.465
- Well, obviously...
- Denise! I'd cut it.

07:51.513 --> 07:54.183
I'm sure that there are some
bored housewives out there

07:54.224 --> 07:56.394
that would enjoy ogling
your Walter Cronkite,

07:56.435 --> 07:58.435
but to me, it looks
like local morning news

07:58.478 --> 08:00.228
from, I don't know, Delaware.

08:00.272 --> 08:01.352
No, it's so Delaware.

08:01.398 --> 08:03.268
- And, yeah, of course.
- Denise!

08:03.317 --> 08:06.647
Jane, this piece was your idea.
I didn't even wanna do it.

08:06.695 --> 08:08.355
Danny, I respect what
you are trying to do,

08:08.405 --> 08:10.275
but maybe this isn't the best fit.

08:10.324 --> 08:12.574
"Not the best fit" the piece or
"not the best fit" you and me?

08:13.952 --> 08:15.542
- Mostly the piece.
- Hey, Jane!

08:15.579 --> 08:16.699
- You're late.
- Okay.

08:16.747 --> 08:19.707
Honestly, it could've gone worse.

08:19.750 --> 08:21.630
JONAH: <i>Did you see that?</i>

08:21.668 --> 08:23.708
I was standing right there
and Furlong didn't invite me

08:23.754 --> 08:25.884
to his little power broker dinner party.

08:25.923 --> 08:26.893
I love paella.

08:26.895 --> 08:29.804
Wives in this town make
the social calendar.

08:29.843 --> 08:32.303
Mrs. Furlong likes inviting couples,

08:32.346 --> 08:33.926
not unregistered sex offenders.

08:33.972 --> 08:36.312
If you wanna position yourself
for higher office long term,

08:36.350 --> 08:39.270
you will need a committed
partner, specifically, a woman.

08:39.311 --> 08:41.101
Fuck that dated paradigm!

08:41.145 --> 08:44.356
I am a balling bachelor
sexual congressman,

08:44.399 --> 08:47.899
and I will be passing bills by
day and smashing gash by night.

08:47.945 --> 08:49.395
Congressman, being a
bachelor in this town

08:49.446 --> 08:51.736
means you're gayer than a TV evangelist.

08:51.782 --> 08:53.412
God damn it! I hate homophobia.

08:53.450 --> 08:56.370
If it's any consolation,
statistically speaking,

08:56.411 --> 08:59.871
married politicians have more
sex with more single women

08:59.915 --> 09:01.705
than single politicians.

09:01.750 --> 09:03.920
Fine. Find me Mrs. Ryan.

09:03.961 --> 09:06.131
- BEN: Okay.
- Not my mom.

09:11.510 --> 09:14.390
<i>but when my opponent
spreads lies about my wife?</i>

09:14.429 --> 09:16.549
<i>How dare you, Buddy Calhoun?</i>

09:16.598 --> 09:18.598
- How dare you?
- AMY: No, he isn't.

09:18.642 --> 09:22.442
He's crying. Haha, what a fucking girl!

09:22.479 --> 09:25.769
Can I borrow you for a second,
Miss Brookheimer? (CLEARS THROAT)

09:25.816 --> 09:27.646
I did not do this,

09:27.693 --> 09:29.533
absolutely, positively.

09:29.569 --> 09:31.319
Fine, I did it!

09:31.363 --> 09:33.033
But that's my job.

09:33.073 --> 09:35.533
I need to clear my head,
because this whole campaign

09:35.575 --> 09:37.115

09:37.160 --> 09:39.290
Oh, what did you envision, Woody,

09:39.329 --> 09:41.449
that you and Buzz Lightyear
would win this election

09:41.498 --> 09:43.208

09:44.376 --> 09:45.456
Will you play that back?

09:45.502 --> 09:46.882
I wanna see him cry again.

MIKE: All right, hit "POTUS SUV."

09:49.256 --> 09:51.126

- Now select playlist.

09:51.174 --> 09:53.514

- There you go, babe.

- Oh, I like that.

09:55.178 --> 09:57.048
Hey, who are we meeting
with again today?

09:57.097 --> 09:59.557
The President of Smith
College, Regina Pell.

09:59.599 --> 10:02.849
Gigi Pell. God, that's
a blast from the past.

10:02.894 --> 10:04.644
Aw, you were college buddies?

10:04.688 --> 10:06.558
No, I don't really
remember her that well.

10:06.606 --> 10:09.766
Also, estimates for construction
are coming in at $300 million.

10:09.818 --> 10:11.688
- What?
- The money's out there.

10:11.737 --> 10:13.697
We just can't get our
hands on it right now.

10:13.739 --> 10:16.199
How do you get this to read the
texts and emails out loud?

10:16.241 --> 10:18.411
I mean, can we reallocate
some of the money

10:18.452 --> 10:20.542
from the Meyer Fund to the library?

10:20.579 --> 10:22.369
- Absolutely, yes.
- That's actually a felony.

10:22.414 --> 10:23.714
So, we just tell them
that we have it all...

10:23.749 --> 10:24.909
And then we just shuffle papers around

10:24.958 --> 10:26.498
until it looks like we actually do.

10:26.543 --> 10:28.043
- Okay.
- That's also a felony.

10:28.086 --> 10:31.126
KENT: <i> In order to find an ideal match,</i>

10:31.173 --> 10:32.883
the restaurant, table, food, and time

10:32.924 --> 10:34.844
will be the same for every
date to establish a control.

10:34.885 --> 10:36.795
- The girl will be different.
- Jesus, Kent.

10:36.845 --> 10:39.005
He's just gotta go to a
Laundromat, meet a girl,

10:39.056 --> 10:40.886
take her to a movie, a little chit-chat,

10:40.932 --> 10:43.642
couple-three drinks, standard
hayjay in the cab home,

10:43.685 --> 10:45.095
and a year later, he's a father.

10:45.145 --> 10:47.305
I mean, why do you make it
so goddamn complicated?

10:47.356 --> 10:49.556
You know, one time, I tried hitting
on a girl at a Laundromat.

10:49.608 --> 10:52.528
For somebody with broken
English, she was real uppity.

10:52.569 --> 10:55.859
- There's your answer.
- Carry on.

10:55.906 --> 10:57.736
Every potential mate
has been preselected

10:57.783 --> 11:01.373
from the online dating pool
of DC women ages 25 to 30

11:01.411 --> 11:04.291
with a strong interest in
marriage to you in particular.

11:04.331 --> 11:06.621
Son of a bitch. I'm gonna go broke
paying for all those dates.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.536
Unlikely. There's only four.

11:08.585 --> 11:11.955
We had to extend to the greater
Baltimore, Arlington, Alexandria area

11:12.005 --> 11:13.125
<i>to find them.</i>

11:13.173 --> 11:15.133
Well, we got a "maybe" in Delaware.

11:15.175 --> 11:15.518
That's right.

11:15.520 --> 11:16.546
She's waiting to see
your hair grow back.

11:16.593 --> 11:18.133
So, maybe five?

11:18.178 --> 11:21.008
I'd budget for four.

11:21.056 --> 11:23.556
REGINA: <i>I must say I'm just
blown away that you were able</i>

11:23.600 --> 11:25.310
to raise so much money so quickly.

11:25.352 --> 11:27.102
You know what? I think I'm
gonna go buy a Splett shirt.

11:27.145 --> 11:29.265
Uh, sweatshirt. Yeah, that's
what we call it in my family.

11:29.314 --> 11:30.419
Okay, great.

11:30.421 --> 11:33.735
Well, this could not
come at a better time.

11:33.777 --> 11:36.107
The Selina Meyer Presidential Library

11:36.154 --> 11:38.914
and School for Public
Policy and Women's Studies

11:38.949 --> 11:40.449
is just where we need to be headed.

11:40.492 --> 11:42.742
I think that title is a
bit of a word salad.

11:42.786 --> 11:44.826
Maybe trim that last part about women.

11:44.871 --> 11:47.871
And of course you would be offered
a full tenured professorship.

11:47.916 --> 11:49.526
Oh, now, would that mean I would have...

11:49.528 --> 11:50.627
Teach? Oh, no. God, no.

11:50.669 --> 11:52.129
- Because my schedule...
- Your schedule...

11:52.170 --> 11:53.550
is just constantly...

11:53.588 --> 11:55.258
- in flux.
- fucked.

11:55.298 --> 11:56.708
Flux. That's what I said.

11:56.758 --> 11:57.758
- Did you wanna hang that?
- Yeah.

11:57.801 --> 12:00.091
- Great.
- Wow!

12:00.137 --> 12:02.257
- I just... I can't believe it.
- Look at us.

12:02.305 --> 12:04.005
Do you remember that night junior year?

12:04.057 --> 12:04.870
No.

12:04.872 --> 12:07.308
Chardonnay on the quad
after Julia Child Day?

12:07.352 --> 12:09.022
You know what, I'm
strictly a scotch girl

12:09.062 --> 12:10.102
and I always have been,

12:10.147 --> 12:12.897
so I never really experimented...

12:14.526 --> 12:16.396
with Chardonnay.

12:16.445 --> 12:21.605
Um, so I think you've got me
confused with somebody else.

12:21.658 --> 12:23.368
- I don't think I was confused.
- Good for you.

12:23.410 --> 12:24.780
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

12:24.828 --> 12:26.078
- All right.
- So... oh, we're going up here?

12:26.121 --> 12:27.871
Yes, we are going up here.

12:27.914 --> 12:30.214
SELINA: <i> I understand you
girls have some questions</i>

12:30.250 --> 12:32.250
- about the library.
- Yeah.

12:32.294 --> 12:33.901
You know what, actually,
just before that...

12:33.903 --> 12:34.545
Mm-hmm, sure.

12:34.588 --> 12:37.418
I wanted to ask you about your
controversial pardon of Sherman Tanz...

12:37.466 --> 12:38.309
Renee.

12:38.311 --> 12:40.837
..and the recent revelations
of widespread abuse

12:40.886 --> 12:43.046
in his women's prisons
that he owns in New York.

12:43.096 --> 12:44.886
- Wait till she crosses her legs.
- Sure, okay.

12:44.931 --> 12:49.181
Things aren't always as black
and white as they may seem.

12:49.227 --> 12:51.057
- Um...
- Now, now, now, now, now.

12:51.104 --> 12:52.654
Not that it matters,

12:52.689 --> 12:57.359
but as a nephew of a
survivor of the Holocaust...

12:57.402 --> 12:59.822
- Mm.
- mm...

12:59.863 --> 13:03.363
Sherman Tanz is particularly sensitive

13:03.408 --> 13:05.278
to prison conditions.

13:05.327 --> 13:07.487
And he is intimately involved

13:07.537 --> 13:10.747
with every aspect of his company.

13:10.790 --> 13:14.500
Now, that being said, he had
no idea what was going on.

13:14.544 --> 13:19.514
And he immediately fired the
number five man in charge

13:19.549 --> 13:21.469
as well as a couple of sixes.

13:21.510 --> 13:24.510
- But, you know, the male-dominated media...
- Yes.

13:24.554 --> 13:26.014
they just can't help themselves.

13:26.056 --> 13:27.966
<i>Sadly, it's what I've come to expect</i>

13:28.016 --> 13:31.266

13:33.271 --> 13:34.771
"phallus quo."

13:36.024 --> 13:37.324
- <i> I apologize.</i>
- Phallus!

13:37.359 --> 13:39.439
That's why it's so vital

13:39.486 --> 13:40.997
that we have a school
for public policy...

13:40.999 --> 13:41.897
And women's studies.

13:41.947 --> 13:43.907
TBD... here at Smith.

13:43.949 --> 13:46.449
- Yes.
- So...

13:46.493 --> 13:49.204
That's our first woman president, y'all!

13:49.206 --> 13:51.254
Yeah, holla, holla, holla.

- It doesn't have to say goodbye.

Gary, you gotta give
Mike one of your shirts.

They're bespoke tailored.

our new co-living arrangements.

wrap gifts on the sidewalk.

wanted Daddy and I to get back together.

Then you sent me to etiquette camp.

Yes, where you learned
to interrupt, evidently.

A lot of people think that they
just slice one off, right?

What they really do is they make an
incision just a little bit further up,

16:06.758 --> 16:08.838
and they go in and they
grab the testicle,

16:35.495 --> 16:36.905
- All right, cool. No, of course.
- Great.

16:39.207 --> 16:40.617
Oh, the bathrooms are that way.

16:43.128 --> 16:45.208
SELINA: Okay, so who's
the big swinging dick

16:45.255 --> 16:47.505
at this fundraising gang bang tonight?

16:47.549 --> 16:50.469
David Sloane, hedge fund manager.
He's in for a million.

16:50.510 --> 16:53.640
1.5 if we can get his
dyslexic daughter into Smith.

16:53.680 --> 16:58.140
Well, maybe get her to write the check.
Get 5.1 out of him.

16:58.184 --> 17:01.564
What do you think about our
little girl becoming a mother?

17:01.604 --> 17:04.114
Ugh, I'm just... I'm feeling really old.

17:04.148 --> 17:05.819
You're being ridiculous.

17:05.858 --> 17:08.108
People are gonna think you're
the hot, young babysitter.

17:08.153 --> 17:10.282
- No, they won't.
- Like we played last night.

17:10.320 --> 17:12.451
Oh, my God.

17:12.490 --> 17:15.160
Stop it, Mr. Meyer.

17:17.662 --> 17:19.832
- Do you want a snack or... no?
- No, thanks.

17:19.873 --> 17:22.002
AUTOMATED VOICE: <i>You have three
text messages from Helen Wright.</i>

17:22.040 --> 17:24.751
- Is that my phone?
- No, my pants didn't vibrate.

17:24.794 --> 17:27.594
Oh, that's me. Sorry,
I'll get... turn that off.

17:27.630 --> 17:29.560
AUTOMATED VOICE: <i> Do you
want to hear the messages?</i>

17:29.562 --> 17:30.471
Nah, nah, that's okay.

17:30.508 --> 17:33.088
- <i> I did not recognize that command.</i>
- No.

17:33.136 --> 17:36.796
You have to really enunciate. No. No.

17:36.848 --> 17:41.098
<i>Message number one... "I can still taste
you in my mouth from last night."</i>

17:41.144 --> 17:41.837
What the fuck is going on?

17:41.839 --> 17:43.065
Boy, we should not be listening to that.

17:43.104 --> 17:44.944
That's probably to her boyfriend.

17:44.981 --> 17:48.521
I imagine she's texting
while riding her bicycle

17:48.568 --> 17:50.608
and sent it to me by mistake.

17:50.653 --> 17:53.363
<i>Second message... "You came so much.</i>

17:53.406 --> 17:56.116
<i>Andrew, we ruined your
wife's pretty office chair.</i>

17:56.159 --> 17:59.539
<i>I get so hot thinking of the
president sitting in our love puddle.</i>

17:59.579 --> 18:01.289
<i>Call me after the fundraiser."</i>

18:01.331 --> 18:03.161
That was a long one. She
must be at a light.

18:09.714 --> 18:11.384
Look, Lee...

18:11.424 --> 18:16.724
Not one fucking word.

18:21.017 --> 18:22.767
You are the devil!

18:22.811 --> 18:25.601
- You are the fucking devil!
- Jesus Christ, he's crazy!

18:25.647 --> 18:27.187
You are the fucking devil!

18:27.232 --> 18:28.732
No, Gary! Stop!

18:28.775 --> 18:31.475
- SELINA: Gary!
- GARY: I swear to God!

18:31.528 --> 18:33.108
- I will kill you in your face!
- Stop it!

18:33.154 --> 18:35.574
- WOMAN: <i> President Meyer!</i>
- Hello. Hey!

18:35.615 --> 18:37.615
- <i> (REPORTERS CLAMORING)</i>
- So happy to see you. Thank you.

18:37.659 --> 18:39.699
- MAN: Does the library have a name?
- It's the Selina Meyer

18:39.744 --> 18:44.214
Presidential Library and School for
Public Policy, and that's all.

18:44.249 --> 18:46.919
We're really excited.
Really, really excited.

18:46.960 --> 18:49.670
<i>Thank you so much. Yeah, we have
a lot of good friends here.</i>

18:49.712 --> 18:51.252
WOMAN: <i>So, luckily, the doctors</i>

18:51.297 --> 18:53.757
were able to remove the mass
without a full mastectomy,

18:53.800 --> 18:56.010
so I got to keep my nipple.

18:56.052 --> 18:56.585
Whoo-hoo, right?

18:56.587 --> 18:58.183
I'm gonna go ahead and
be honest with you.

18:58.221 --> 19:00.351
That was the most disgusting
story I've ever heard.

19:00.390 --> 19:02.680
Now I can't... I can't
finish my chicken piccata.

19:02.725 --> 19:03.845
- Excuse me. (SNAPS FINGERS)
- WAITER: <i> Yes?</i>

19:03.893 --> 19:05.393
We're gonna get her dessert to go.

19:05.436 --> 19:07.476
Sorry, I think I have to
use the restroom, okay?

19:09.649 --> 19:12.069
The restroom is that way.

19:12.110 --> 19:16.030
I mean, I just can't believe
I fell for it again!

19:16.072 --> 19:18.032
Andrew is very hard to get rid of.

19:18.074 --> 19:20.664
He's like the herpes virus
or an unwanted child.

19:20.702 --> 19:22.122
<i>In this case, he gave me both.</i>

19:22.161 --> 19:23.241
You can't just be that woman

19:23.288 --> 19:25.498
who's standing by her man,

19:25.540 --> 19:27.120
smiling like Lobotomy Barbie

19:27.166 --> 19:30.246
- while he goes fucking...
- <i> I know, I know.</i>

19:30.295 --> 19:32.745
- <i> But, Amy, do you think that...</i>
- Ma'am, I gotta go.

19:32.797 --> 19:35.547
Well, Amy Brookheimer
just hung up on me.

19:35.592 --> 19:37.132
Doesn't get lower than that, does it?

19:39.053 --> 19:41.893
Oh, you are really
loving this, aren't you?

19:41.931 --> 19:44.681
Well, I just didn't wanna tell
you "I told you so," but...

19:44.726 --> 19:46.636
- Because you didn't.
- Okay. (SCOFFS)

19:46.686 --> 19:49.186
Right? You just rolled your eyes
like the world's bitchiest mime.

19:49.230 --> 19:50.940
Like you just did right there.

19:50.982 --> 19:52.232
- And there it is again, see?
- CATHERINE: <i> Hey, Mom?</i>

19:52.275 --> 19:54.185
I just wanted to see how you were doing.

19:54.235 --> 19:56.855
God, I'm really starting to understand
this whole lesbian thing now.

19:56.905 --> 19:59.025
- Glad you're coming around.
- I'm just getting drunk here

19:59.073 --> 20:03.243
on Gary's great bourbon from
his inbred backwoods family.

20:03.286 --> 20:06.196
What? There is zero
inbreeding in my family.

20:06.247 --> 20:08.747
- Well, that's not true at all.
- And only case of schizophrenia,

20:08.791 --> 20:10.461
but my uncle-grandpa had her sterilized,

20:10.501 --> 20:12.081
and we are all good...

20:12.128 --> 20:13.878
Now he's just going on and
on for no apparent reason.

20:13.922 --> 20:18.552
Listen, honey, I want you to
tell your whore of a father

20:18.593 --> 20:21.643
that I fired the art skank.

20:21.679 --> 20:24.009
- Yeah.
- Well, I'm not gonna tell him you said that,

20:24.057 --> 20:27.977
but I am really sorry
that Dad did this to you.

20:28.019 --> 20:29.599
Oh.

20:29.646 --> 20:31.556
That is just the sweetest thing.

20:31.606 --> 20:33.646
We're just one big, happy family!

20:33.691 --> 20:35.571
- Oh, no.
- <i> Okay.</i>

20:35.610 --> 20:37.400
You know what I'm thinking? Maybe...

20:38.821 --> 20:40.741
maybe this isn't a good time

20:40.782 --> 20:42.412
for you to get pregnant.

20:42.450 --> 20:46.990
- You are the worst.
- Oh.

20:47.038 --> 20:48.408
- Ugh.
- What?

20:48.456 --> 20:49.786
GARY: <i>Where is that... what?</i>

20:49.832 --> 20:51.502
- That's from her father.
- Yeah.

20:51.542 --> 20:53.712
Ma'am,

20:53.753 --> 20:56.423
you are unstable and manipulative,

20:56.464 --> 20:59.174
and I worry about the genes
you'll pass down to your child...

20:59.217 --> 21:01.377
- Mm.
- but your ex is worse.

21:03.262 --> 21:06.102
I appreciate that. Means a lot.

21:06.140 --> 21:07.850
You're like a son to me.

21:07.892 --> 21:09.562
Thank you, ma'am.

21:09.602 --> 21:10.772
You can call me "Mom."

21:12.230 --> 21:14.150
Thank you, Mom.

21:14.190 --> 21:17.110
Except, you know, it
doesn't quite sound right,

21:17.151 --> 21:19.321
- you know, when you hear it out loud.
- GARY: <i> Mm-mm.</i>

21:19.362 --> 21:21.822
- So, let's just stick with the ma'am.
- Ma'am.

21:21.864 --> 21:23.414
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yeah, yeah, thank you.

21:23.449 --> 21:24.949
- Yeah, that was a good edit.
- Right?

21:24.993 --> 21:26.873
- Yeah.
- <i> Really good edit.</i>

21:26.911 --> 21:28.371
- Go back to where we were with that.
- <i> Yeah.</i>

21:28.413 --> 21:31.463
(SIGHS)

21:31.499 --> 21:32.999
- (GRUNTS)
- <i> (GLASS SHATTERS)</i>

21:33.042 --> 21:34.922
Ugh.

21:34.961 --> 21:36.541
- Do you wanna label any of these boxes?
- No!

21:39.841 --> 21:41.631
And I want all the touch screens

21:41.676 --> 21:44.676
to say that they're powered
by my clean energy initiative

21:44.721 --> 21:46.431
'cause those ecotards love that shit.

21:46.472 --> 21:48.642
- Do you want a butterscotch?
- Oh, never for me.

21:48.683 --> 21:52.233
Ma'am, bad news. Helen Wright is
going public with you firing her.

21:52.270 --> 21:53.440
<i>It's in the "Post" and
getting traction elsewhere.</i>

21:53.479 --> 21:55.149
Jesus Christ!

21:55.189 --> 21:57.439
She's telling the world about
how she was blowing Andrew

21:57.483 --> 21:59.193
in my office chair?!

21:59.235 --> 22:01.235
No, ma'am, it's mostly about
how Andrew pursued her,

22:01.279 --> 22:03.029
how she's the victim,
how she lost her job,

22:03.072 --> 22:04.532
and then there's this nickname stuff.

22:04.574 --> 22:06.704
What nickname stuff are
you talking about?

22:06.743 --> 22:09.453
Apparently, Andrew kept referring
to his penis as the "First Chubby."

22:09.495 --> 22:11.035
- Oof.
- Oh, God.

22:11.080 --> 22:12.910
- All right, your fly is down.
- What?

22:12.957 --> 22:14.957
Oh, wait, guys, we don't have a problem.

22:15.001 --> 22:16.541
Helen signed an NDA.

22:16.586 --> 22:19.126
We're gonna sue her for
breach of contract.

22:19.172 --> 22:21.342
Well, we could had we paid her.

22:21.382 --> 22:23.672
- Who was in charge of that?
- Andrew.

22:23.718 --> 22:27.548
Okay, well, fucked again
by the First Chubby.

22:27.597 --> 22:29.217
And both of your shoes are untied.

22:29.265 --> 22:31.215
How did that happen?

22:31.267 --> 22:33.267
I got one theory.

22:33.311 --> 22:35.021
MIKE: Oh, my God.

22:35.063 --> 22:37.613
- What?
- This Helen thing is exploding.

22:37.648 --> 22:40.318
It's everywhere. Are you sure you don't
wanna hire a communications director?

22:40.359 --> 22:42.899
- Okay, fine, you're hired.
- Oh, congratulations!

22:42.945 --> 22:43.818
What are they saying?

22:43.820 --> 22:46.106
Well, they're mad at you
for victim-blaming Helen

22:46.157 --> 22:47.617
for Andrew's behavior.

22:47.658 --> 22:49.448
- You're fired.
- Tough break, buddy.

22:49.494 --> 22:51.874
I'm the only one who
didn't do anything wrong

22:51.913 --> 22:53.753
in this "trifuckta."

22:53.790 --> 22:55.290
And now I'm wearing the scarlet letter?

22:55.333 --> 22:57.083
Oh, that is your color.

22:57.126 --> 22:58.666
Oh, ma'am, look how excited
they are to see you.

22:58.711 --> 23:00.381
Oh, wait, you may not wanna
look out the window.

23:00.421 --> 23:01.881
(ALL CHANTING) ...no library!

23:01.923 --> 23:04.423
No justice, no library!

23:04.467 --> 23:07.797
- No justice, no library!
- I understand everything.

23:07.845 --> 23:09.505
I'll tell you something, I can
tell you're very emotional

23:09.555 --> 23:13.265
because I'm very emotional,
too, about this issue.

23:13.309 --> 23:16.189
- Helen Wright is a victim!
- I think that we are both victims...

23:16.229 --> 23:19.229
- How the fuck can you say that?!
- I can say that...

23:19.273 --> 23:21.233
- Don't talk over me!
- Okay.

23:21.275 --> 23:23.275
I think we need to tone down...

23:23.319 --> 23:26.649
- (VOICES OVERLAPPING)
- Why are you even here?!

23:26.697 --> 23:29.237
JANE: <i>Scandal continues
to dog Selina Meyer...</i>

23:29.283 --> 23:32.243
- What is this snapping?
- as allegations of sexual misconduct

23:32.286 --> 23:34.866
swirl around her
ex-husband, Andrew Meyer.

23:34.914 --> 23:36.794
And speaking of politics,

23:36.833 --> 23:40.383
he's 28 feet tall and
only bathes once a year.

23:40.419 --> 23:42.209
That's right, Jane.

23:42.255 --> 23:44.375
The Lincoln Memorial has been
undergoing its annual cleaning,

23:44.423 --> 23:46.013
so I'm heading to DC.

23:46.050 --> 23:47.340
Gonna check in with
the people down there

23:47.385 --> 23:48.795
that are involved with the project.

23:48.845 --> 23:51.795
- Very exciting stuff.
- What fun!

23:51.848 --> 23:53.694
Don't forget to pack
your long johns, Danny.

23:53.696 --> 23:54.696
(CHUCKLES) Will do.

23:54.725 --> 23:57.635
So, until tomorrow, I'm Jane McCabe.

23:57.687 --> 24:00.687
- And I'm Danny Egan.
- See you in the tomorrow.

24:00.731 --> 24:02.271
- MAN: <i> And we're clear.</i>
- JANE: Denise!

24:02.316 --> 24:04.856
- Do me a favor.
- Sure, man.

24:04.902 --> 24:07.902
Wrap that wire around
my neck until I'm dead.

24:07.947 --> 24:10.867
REGINA: <i>I am so sorry about
the protest out there.</i>

24:10.908 --> 24:13.488
I don't like the word shrill
because it's so misogynistic,

24:13.536 --> 24:15.576
- but in this case...
- <i> Believe me, I understand.</i>

24:15.621 --> 24:17.781
I mean, there isn't a
tampon in the world...

24:17.783 --> 24:18.502
Right?

24:18.541 --> 24:21.581
big enough to soak up
that mess out there, my God.

24:21.627 --> 24:25.497
So, um, I think the architects
are meeting us today or...?

24:25.548 --> 24:29.218
Selina, we have to put
the library on hold.

24:29.260 --> 24:30.680
What?!

24:30.720 --> 24:33.430
Because of those 18-year-old
bitches out there?!

24:33.472 --> 24:36.352
What am I supposed to do,
rehire Frida Swallow?

24:36.392 --> 24:38.022
Oh, well...

24:38.060 --> 24:40.060
Oh, well, that's not gonna happen.

24:40.104 --> 24:42.194
- It would totally defuse their rage.
- No, no, no, no.

24:42.231 --> 24:44.691
It would show that you listened if you
made a public show of embracing her.

24:44.734 --> 24:49.244
No, that's like Princess Di hiring Camilla
Parker Bowles to be her limo driver.

24:49.280 --> 24:51.110
I mean, I'm just... you know,
although in that case,

24:51.157 --> 24:53.567
it would've worked out better
for her, obviously, but...

24:53.618 --> 24:56.056
Selina, we're talking about
your legacy for the ages.

24:56.058 --> 24:56.869
Oh, my God.

24:56.913 --> 24:58.081
Just think about it.

24:58.083 --> 25:01.584
Just... Regina, can we just...
can we just take a pause here?

25:01.626 --> 25:02.956
- Okay.
- Um...

25:04.712 --> 25:07.922
why don't you and I go
out to dinner, okay,

25:07.965 --> 25:09.165
and if we...

25:10.635 --> 25:12.545
if we need more time, you know,

25:12.595 --> 25:15.045
let's go back to my hotel

25:15.097 --> 25:17.007
and we can have that Chardonnay...

25:18.517 --> 25:20.807
I'm in a committed relationship.

25:20.853 --> 25:22.693
Yeah, I really, honestly...

25:22.730 --> 25:25.440
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

25:25.483 --> 25:27.653
You're just, like...

25:27.693 --> 25:30.653
BUDDY: <i> I can't believe I
spent the night in jail.</i>

25:30.696 --> 25:32.276
It's a piddly DUI.

25:32.323 --> 25:33.993
In Nevada, that's practically
a resume builder.

25:34.033 --> 25:35.783
There's a guy driving
drunk on the state flag

25:35.826 --> 25:37.486
right next to the guy beating his wife.

25:37.536 --> 25:39.576
No, it's a five-pointed star.

25:39.622 --> 25:41.962
Hey, hobos, get off the Internet.
This isn't the library.

25:41.999 --> 25:45.079
This is the dashcam footage
from Buddy's arrest last night.

25:45.127 --> 25:47.167
Ooh, easy! Easy, pretty lady.

25:47.213 --> 25:49.513
- What, are you on the rag?
- OFFICER: Calm down, sir.

25:49.548 --> 25:51.588
Pretty... it's a pretty pristine image.

25:51.634 --> 25:53.594
Oh, yeah, you're all hot and juicy now.

25:53.636 --> 25:55.336
I bet if I take you home to bed,

25:55.388 --> 25:58.058
you're just gonna lie there
with your BlackBerry

25:58.099 --> 26:00.099
<i>and no dirty talk for Uncle Buddy then.</i>

26:00.142 --> 26:03.192
- That is not about you.
- You don't think I have balls?

26:03.229 --> 26:06.019
Guess what, I got balls.
I got big, blue balls.

26:06.065 --> 26:07.475
- You wanna see them?
- Sir.

26:07.525 --> 26:10.065
You wanna see my big, blue balls?
This is them!

26:10.111 --> 26:12.491
- Get on the hood.
- Ow! Oh!

26:12.530 --> 26:14.070
You know, I blacked out.

26:14.115 --> 26:16.445
I... I don't remember any of that.

26:16.492 --> 26:19.032
Okay? Can I count on your vote?

26:19.078 --> 26:20.488
<i>(OFFICER ON DISPATCH) I'm
on my way to check it out.</i>

26:22.456 --> 26:24.076
I love Sting's solo stuff.

26:24.125 --> 26:25.535
Say your favorite album on three.

26:25.584 --> 26:27.464
- One, two, three...
- BOTH: "Soul Cages."

26:27.503 --> 26:29.043
- Come on, get out of here!
- Stop it.

26:29.088 --> 26:30.798
- Are you serious?
- What else is it gonna be?

26:30.840 --> 26:32.760
- That's crazy?
- Can I say something?

26:32.800 --> 26:34.550
- Sure!
- You have a rockin' body.

26:34.593 --> 26:37.263
- Oh, thank you.
- You know, go ahead and order a dessert.

26:37.305 --> 26:39.215
- I know you had an appetizer...
- Oh, I'm not a dessert kind of girl.

26:39.265 --> 26:42.305
Hey, if it isn't Congressman
Jonah Ryan of New Hampshire.

26:42.351 --> 26:43.931
- Hi!
- This is my friend Dan,

26:43.978 --> 26:45.688
- who is just leaving.
- Oh, what are you doing?

26:45.730 --> 26:48.190
Oh, shit, she can see. That's a shocker.

26:48.232 --> 26:50.112
Oh, wow! You're Danny.

26:50.151 --> 26:51.651
I watch you when I'm on the treadmill.

26:51.694 --> 26:53.074
- Of course you work out.
- It's just Dan.

26:53.112 --> 26:55.572
And let me give you one
word of advice... run.

26:55.614 --> 26:58.284
This predator has roofied more
women than Kappa Alpha Cosby.

26:58.326 --> 27:00.326
Okay, that's not an actual fraternity.

27:00.369 --> 27:02.369
So, unless you enjoy the thrill of waking
up in a basement torture dungeon...

27:02.413 --> 27:04.163
- No.
- I'd say call it a night.

27:04.206 --> 27:06.206
- You know, maybe I should go.
- Kristal, it's fine.

27:06.250 --> 27:08.170
It's just an unfinished basement,
and he's just fucking with you.

27:08.210 --> 27:09.540
This is for trapping me in a job

27:09.587 --> 27:11.377
that makes me long for the
days of Selina Meyer.

27:11.422 --> 27:13.462
And I'm gonna fuck your girlfriend.
(CLICKS TONGUE)

27:13.507 --> 27:14.837
- Oh, and, Kristal?
- Yes?

27:14.884 --> 27:16.264
- Can I give you a ride home?
- Okay.

27:16.302 --> 27:18.552
It's the least I could do.

27:18.596 --> 27:20.636
(SNAPS FINGERS) Sir, can
I have the check...?

27:24.685 --> 27:26.765
I'm sorry, could you move your head a
little bit more to the light, ma'am?

27:28.439 --> 27:31.609
- Yeah, I'm not gonna do that.
- Shh.

27:31.650 --> 27:33.900
- Oh.
- Sorry to interrupt.

27:33.944 --> 27:36.204
Smith is a no.

27:36.238 --> 27:39.198
(SCOFFS, CLEARS THROAT)

27:39.241 --> 27:42.791
Well, you can pack up your crayons
and get the fuck out of here.

27:44.163 --> 27:45.703
- What?
- Gary.

27:45.748 --> 27:47.118
Yep.

27:48.376 --> 27:49.666
- (SELINA GRUNTS)
- Oh!

27:49.710 --> 27:51.460
(STAMMERS) I'm sorry.

27:51.504 --> 27:53.924
If there's one thing I learned
in the Air National Guard,

27:53.964 --> 27:56.674
it is respect for a woman in uniform.

27:56.717 --> 27:58.547
I have no hate in my heart.

27:58.594 --> 28:02.434
I love women, especially
my beautiful fiancÃ©e, Amy.

28:02.473 --> 28:05.063
But now it is time to focus
on the issues at hand

28:05.101 --> 28:07.601
that concern the people
of the state of Nevada.

28:07.645 --> 28:08.845
Let us pray.

28:10.856 --> 28:12.516
Heavenly Father,

28:12.566 --> 28:16.646
warden of eternal light,

28:16.695 --> 28:19.315
teach us to love women,

28:19.365 --> 28:22.565
but in a way that is respectful.

28:22.618 --> 28:25.118
And also, Your compassion.

28:26.997 --> 28:28.497
And amen.
