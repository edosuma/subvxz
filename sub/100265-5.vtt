00:33.950 --> 00:36.995
My hero is the famous astronaut
Grant Kelly.

00:37.078 --> 00:38.538
He was brave and smart,

00:38.621 --> 00:40.623
and he was also my biological dad.

00:41.374 --> 00:43.501
Grant Kelly was born in Detroit,
Michigan.

00:44.002 --> 00:46.463
He got a scholarship to MIT when he was 17

00:46.755 --> 00:48.715
and graduated top of his class.

00:49.299 --> 00:51.176
Then he went into the space program.

00:51.259 --> 00:52.969
He got to go to the moon and Mars,

00:53.053 --> 00:54.763
which is really far away.

00:54.846 --> 00:56.890
Farther away than Disneyland or France.

01:05.106 --> 01:08.526
He was one of the first people to work
on the Alpha Centauri program.

01:09.527 --> 01:11.196
I never got to meet Grant Kelly.

01:11.279 --> 01:12.614
He died before I was born.

01:12.697 --> 01:15.617
But everyone who knew him
said he was very courageous.

01:15.700 --> 01:17.118
That's why he's my hero.

01:20.955 --> 01:23.249
Thank you, Judy,
that was a wonderful presentation.

01:23.333 --> 01:24.167
I'm not done.

01:34.761 --> 01:36.596
My other hero is my adopted dad,

01:36.971 --> 01:38.014
John Robinson.

01:38.598 --> 01:41.267
He's a Navy SEAL.
He protects us from bad guys.

01:41.726 --> 01:43.186
He also tells funny jokes

01:43.269 --> 01:45.313
and makes me hot chocolate when I'm sick.

01:46.314 --> 01:49.400
And he always read me a bedtime story,
even when he's far away.

01:50.026 --> 01:52.612
I'm very lucky that I have two heroes
to look up to.

02:04.040 --> 02:06.251
<i>How you doing down there, John?</i>

02:06.334 --> 02:07.794
-<i>John?</i>

02:11.631 --> 02:12.674
Believe it or not,

02:13.383 --> 02:14.217
I've been worse.

02:14.717 --> 02:16.302
<i>How are things up there?</i>

02:17.345 --> 02:19.848
We've got about four hours
until we can get to you.

02:19.931 --> 02:21.933
<i>-You gotta hang on.</i>

02:22.559 --> 02:23.434
Hang on.

02:23.893 --> 02:25.854
Right. Huh.

03:08.521 --> 03:10.315
Possible spine fracture
and head trauma.

03:10.398 --> 03:11.983
He has multiple contusions.

03:12.066 --> 03:14.777
- He likely has internal injuries.
-Yes, his pulse is weak

03:14.861 --> 03:16.571
and irregular oxygenation is compromised.

03:16.654 --> 03:17.906
His temp is dropping.

03:17.989 --> 03:19.240
He's bradycardic.

03:20.033 --> 03:24.329
Okay, we're gonna need a CT image
of his head, thoracic and lumbar spine.

03:28.041 --> 03:28.875
What is it?

03:29.500 --> 03:30.335
I don't know.

03:30.418 --> 03:33.463
But it's turning this metal into
weird pencil shavings.

03:33.546 --> 03:35.548
I've never seen anything rust that fast.

03:35.840 --> 03:37.926
The Chariots are made of a ferrous alloy.

03:38.009 --> 03:40.762
Mostly titanium so it's not rust,
it's some kind of...

03:41.429 --> 03:42.597
chemical infection.

03:43.223 --> 03:44.557
How is that even possible?

03:45.099 --> 03:48.478
The answer to how is that
insert-bad-thing-here even possible,

03:48.561 --> 03:50.438
it's always the same.
We're on an alien planet.

03:51.689 --> 03:52.899
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

03:55.693 --> 03:57.111
It spreads through contact.

03:58.154 --> 03:58.988
Great.

04:00.657 --> 04:01.783
Everyone listen up.

04:02.367 --> 04:04.994
I want all vehicles grounded at base camp
until further notice.

04:05.078 --> 04:07.080
That's Chariots, Jupiters, everything.

04:28.351 --> 04:29.894
Hey Judy, do you copy?

04:31.271 --> 04:33.648
Yeah.
I just dropped off a patient.

04:33.731 --> 04:36.276
-I'm heading back to you now.
- <i>You might wanna hurry.</i>

04:36.734 --> 04:39.237
I fell and I got poked by a damn rod.

04:39.821 --> 04:40.905
Poked?

04:40.989 --> 04:43.533
Well, more like impaled.

04:45.118 --> 04:47.745
Can you, uh, tell me where
the puncture wound is exactly?

04:47.829 --> 04:49.080
Left hand side,

04:49.956 --> 04:51.332
just below my abdomen.

04:51.416 --> 04:52.875
How much blood have you lost?

04:53.334 --> 04:55.420
<i>It's not gushing, so moderate.</i>

04:55.837 --> 04:57.714
I'm applying pressure now.

04:58.047 --> 04:59.757
Okay, can you read me your vitals?

05:00.174 --> 05:01.301
Heart rate is 100,

05:01.384 --> 05:04.345
<i>blood pressure is 140 over 80.</i>

05:04.470 --> 05:06.973
And, uh, temperature is 98.6.

05:07.557 --> 05:09.225
Your temp and BP are normal.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.019
Heart rate is high
but that's to be expected.

05:11.102 --> 05:13.479
I can't tell if
you punctured a vital organ,

05:13.563 --> 05:15.565
but it sounds like
the rod is holding its position,

05:15.648 --> 05:17.275
that's why you didn't bleed out instantly.

05:17.358 --> 05:19.235
Ah. Lucky me.

05:19.694 --> 05:22.322
Dad, it's important that you don't move.

05:22.405 --> 05:24.240
Further damage could cause
the infected vessels

05:24.365 --> 05:26.534
to bleed more freely,
sending you into hypovolemic shock.

05:27.160 --> 05:30.121
You're gonna need an epinephrine shot ASAP
to keep your blood pressure up,

05:30.747 --> 05:32.999
and antibiotics for the impending sepsis.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.586
Well, you know where I am.

05:37.295 --> 05:39.797
All right. Keep monitoring your vitals.

05:39.881 --> 05:40.840
I'll be there soon.

05:45.470 --> 05:46.888
Judy Robinson to Hapgood.

05:47.513 --> 05:48.973
This is Hapgood.

05:49.057 --> 05:50.433
How soon can you get to my father?

05:50.516 --> 05:52.226
We're looking at three hours
and 40 minutes.

05:52.310 --> 05:53.686
He can't wait that long.

05:53.770 --> 05:56.939
At the drill site,
there was a pile of long tubing.

05:57.023 --> 05:58.149
<i>Caledon.</i>

05:58.232 --> 06:01.027
Can you send that down to him?
I can use it to get him medical supplies.

06:01.110 --> 06:03.071
Judy, no. You can't take the Chariot.

06:03.154 --> 06:04.614
There was an accident at the drill site.

06:04.697 --> 06:06.783
-I know, I heard your father's trapped.
-No, he's hurt.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.452
And I can't reach my mom
to tell her what's going on

06:09.535 --> 06:10.495
so I need to get to him.

06:10.578 --> 06:12.872
If you take the Chariot,
it could break down before you get there.

06:12.955 --> 06:14.499
You'd be stranded
in the middle of nowhere.

06:14.582 --> 06:15.875
Then I have two people to rescue.

06:15.958 --> 06:18.211
Right. Well, he will die
if I don't do this.

06:21.464 --> 06:23.091
I'm very aware of the risks.

06:25.927 --> 06:26.761
Go.

06:32.517 --> 06:34.394
Just stay inside the perimeter fence.

06:34.477 --> 06:35.561
Got it.

06:44.404 --> 06:46.072
I saw what the robot saw.

06:46.239 --> 06:48.157
I was looking at a hoodoo rock.

06:48.241 --> 06:49.283
That hoodoo rock.

06:49.367 --> 06:51.244
So he's been here the whole time.

06:51.327 --> 06:52.161
Is he okay?

06:52.245 --> 06:54.831
I don't know.
I only saw a flash for a second.

06:55.665 --> 06:58.376
I'm glad you're going to go get him.
I miss his starry face.

06:59.043 --> 07:01.546
How exactly are you gonna find
this particular hoodoo?

07:02.088 --> 07:03.756
I mean, there must be a million out there.

07:03.840 --> 07:06.259
I cross referenced the data stamp
from that photograph

07:06.342 --> 07:08.010
to the map surveys of the planet.

07:08.094 --> 07:11.848
And it looks like the robot is about
200 kilometers east of base camp.

07:11.931 --> 07:13.808
Your dad'll be done working at the well

07:13.891 --> 07:16.185
and once we pick him up,
we can drive there in about a day.

07:16.269 --> 07:18.271
Are you, um, sure you don't need me?

07:18.354 --> 07:20.815
Honey, are you worried about being up here
all by yourself?

07:20.898 --> 07:22.900
Without parental supervision?

07:23.234 --> 07:24.694
I'll struggle through.

07:24.777 --> 07:26.195
You know you have school today.

07:26.988 --> 07:27.989
I thought that was a joke.

07:28.072 --> 07:30.283
You haven't been to school
in seven months.

07:30.366 --> 07:31.868
You make us study every day.

07:32.994 --> 07:34.620
You should be happy
for the change of pace.

07:35.204 --> 07:36.581
Will's not going to school.

07:37.915 --> 07:38.916
Just stay out of trouble.

07:39.959 --> 07:42.545
Or better yet, just wait until I get back.

07:54.599 --> 07:55.433
Oh.

07:55.641 --> 07:56.601
Hey, Mr. Adler.

07:56.684 --> 07:57.935
It's just Ben.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.856
<i>Transport shuttle launch will commence.</i>

08:01.939 --> 08:03.524
<i>-Please stand clear.</i>
-Maureen.

08:04.358 --> 08:06.360
<i>Air pressure stabilized.</i>

08:06.777 --> 08:08.696
I appreciate you letting me tag along.

08:09.530 --> 08:11.782
We both know you'd come
whether I wanted you to or not.

08:11.866 --> 08:15.578
-I woulda thought you wanted the back up.
-We're used to doing things on our own.

08:17.246 --> 08:18.581
So I've noticed.

08:20.124 --> 08:22.335
Look, I know what I'm capable of

08:22.502 --> 08:24.212
and I know what he's capable of.

08:25.129 --> 08:27.340
But you don't know anything about me.

08:29.425 --> 08:30.259
Still,

08:30.843 --> 08:32.678
we're all lost out here together

08:33.137 --> 08:34.013
relying on the...

08:35.014 --> 08:37.642
visions of a twelve-year-old boy
to lead us home.

08:38.434 --> 08:42.104
<i>Launch will commence</i>
<i>in T-minus 30 seconds.</i>

08:42.563 --> 08:44.649
I'll admit, I don't understand

08:45.233 --> 08:46.901
Will's connection to the robot.

08:46.984 --> 08:48.319
It's a mystery to me.

08:48.402 --> 08:50.404
I could guess at the science...

08:53.991 --> 08:56.369
but I think it's deeper than that.

08:57.745 --> 09:00.623
<i>Sealing cabin for airlock disengagement.</i>

09:05.795 --> 09:07.255
Something we have to take on faith.

09:10.341 --> 09:12.009
It's not easy for people like us.

09:18.766 --> 09:23.229
<i>Disengage in T-minus ten, nine, eight,</i>

09:23.604 --> 09:30.027
<i>seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.</i>

09:54.552 --> 09:56.304
Is that Captain Radic? What happened?

09:56.470 --> 09:58.681
One of the doctors said
he just collapsed out of nowhere.

09:58.764 --> 10:00.766
She had no idea what was wrong with him.

10:01.225 --> 10:02.977
-Which doctor?
-A therapist.

10:03.060 --> 10:05.855
Uh, I think she said her name
was Dr. Smith.

10:07.315 --> 10:08.691
Hope this fits your needs.

10:08.983 --> 10:11.485
Most of the offices were destroyed
during the first attack.

10:17.408 --> 10:18.909
It's perfect.

10:19.160 --> 10:20.202
Thank you.

10:20.786 --> 10:22.121
You're welcome, Dr. Smith.

10:25.958 --> 10:27.335
A clean slate.

10:35.134 --> 10:36.177
You were arrested.

10:39.013 --> 10:40.973
A silly misunderstanding.

10:41.557 --> 10:43.184
What did you do to Radic?

10:47.063 --> 10:49.440
One minute he was fine and...

10:50.441 --> 10:52.151
the next he was on the ground.

10:52.234 --> 10:53.069
It...

10:54.153 --> 10:56.113
It all happened so fast.

10:56.197 --> 10:57.448
And now you have an office?

10:58.282 --> 11:00.618
Well, where else am I going
to see my patients?

11:03.996 --> 11:06.415
Everyone's been dealing
with so much trauma.

11:08.542 --> 11:09.710
I wanna do my part.

11:11.587 --> 11:12.797
Help everyone heal.

11:18.678 --> 11:19.595
And move on.

11:24.058 --> 11:26.686
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have a lot of work to do.

11:28.145 --> 11:30.690
-Unless you want to make an appointment.
-No, thank you.

11:45.663 --> 11:46.497
No.

11:47.707 --> 11:48.791
Come on.

11:50.543 --> 11:51.794
No.

12:21.866 --> 12:26.328
<i>You are currently</i>
<i>24.5 kilometers from your destination.</i>

12:29.123 --> 12:30.166
<i>I can't do it.</i>

12:30.249 --> 12:31.292
It's too hard.

12:32.835 --> 12:34.170
It is hard, kiddo,

12:34.253 --> 12:35.629
but you got to keep trying.

12:37.715 --> 12:39.508
I'll just run. I'm good at running.

12:39.592 --> 12:41.343
You are good at running.

12:41.427 --> 12:42.887
In fact, you're good at most things.

12:42.970 --> 12:44.388
But every once in a while

12:44.472 --> 12:46.932
there's gonna be something
that doesn't come easy.

12:47.016 --> 12:49.018
Now, that doesn't mean you just give up.

12:50.436 --> 12:52.563
All right, what do you say we get back on?

12:52.772 --> 12:54.273
Come on, give it another go.

12:58.027 --> 12:58.861
Okay.

13:00.780 --> 13:02.198
Don't let go until I say so.

13:02.281 --> 13:03.491
I won't. You ready?

13:04.617 --> 13:06.035
Don't let go! Don't let go!

13:06.160 --> 13:07.369
I'm here. I'm right here.

13:08.329 --> 13:09.413
Hey, you're doing it.

13:12.291 --> 13:14.752
You're doing it! You're doing it!

13:15.294 --> 13:16.378
Okay, let go!

13:17.546 --> 13:18.756
Woo-hoo!

13:18.881 --> 13:19.799
Look at you!

13:19.882 --> 13:21.926
Watch me, Daddy! Watch me!

13:22.009 --> 13:22.968
I'm watching!

13:27.139 --> 13:28.182
I'm watching.

13:35.981 --> 13:37.983
<i>Judy to Dad, do you copy?</i>

13:38.734 --> 13:39.568
Yeah, I'm here.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.655
How you doing?  BP, heart rate?

13:43.239 --> 13:44.657
No better, no worse.

13:45.032 --> 13:47.034
<i>All right, that's good. No change.</i>

13:47.284 --> 13:49.745
Uh, so whatever made the drill collapse

13:49.829 --> 13:51.330
is now affecting the Chariots.

13:51.413 --> 13:53.123
The one I have just broke down.

13:53.249 --> 13:54.834
I have to go on foot from here.

13:55.543 --> 13:56.794
How far away are you?

13:56.877 --> 13:58.879
About fifteen miles.

13:58.963 --> 14:01.048
- <i>Judy, that's too far.</i>
-Not for me.

14:01.131 --> 14:02.800
If I run at a pace of

14:03.217 --> 14:04.510
eight minutes per mile,

14:04.593 --> 14:06.053
<i>I can get there in two hours.</i>

14:07.596 --> 14:09.932
Hey... you're talking
to the former state champ

14:10.015 --> 14:11.600
-of track and field.

14:11.684 --> 14:12.685
I remember.

14:14.645 --> 14:15.563
<i>Okay.</i>

14:15.646 --> 14:17.898
-Be careful.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

15:08.574 --> 15:11.535
<i>Reminder, class begins in two minutes.</i>

15:23.464 --> 15:24.298
Penny.

15:27.092 --> 15:27.927
Vijay.

15:28.010 --> 15:29.887
We weren't sure
that we'd ever see you again.

15:30.763 --> 15:31.680
Yeah, I know.

15:31.972 --> 15:34.350
I thought you would be on the planet
with the other colonists.

15:34.433 --> 15:36.936
Isn't your dad supposed to be there
representing?

15:37.019 --> 15:39.855
My dad is, but my mom is up here
with logistical team,

15:39.939 --> 15:42.107
so they're making sure
everything's stocked,

15:42.191 --> 15:44.401
ready for people
to come back here and stuff.

15:44.485 --> 15:45.319
Right.

15:49.323 --> 15:50.532
Oh! Do you wanna...?

15:50.616 --> 15:53.035
-No. I sit right-- Right there. Yeah.
-Right. Cool.

15:53.118 --> 15:55.496
All right, everyone, welcome back!

15:56.956 --> 15:58.290
Good to see you again, Penny.

15:58.916 --> 16:00.960
Good to be seen, Mr. Jackson.

16:01.752 --> 16:05.381
Since it appears as if our time
on this planet is coming to an end,

16:05.464 --> 16:06.590
I would be remiss...

16:06.674 --> 16:08.384
So I guess I'll see ya around.

16:08.467 --> 16:09.468
Yeah. See ya around.

16:09.551 --> 16:12.513
...of exploration
to study the unique vegetation

16:12.596 --> 16:14.598
that we're leaving behind.

16:15.641 --> 16:18.602
For this project, we will be working
in groups of two.

16:19.645 --> 16:22.147
So, uh, let's go ahead and partner up.

16:22.231 --> 16:23.399
I'm with Vijay.

16:30.197 --> 16:31.448
Are you sure?

16:31.657 --> 16:33.659
I mean, maybe it was just a coincidence?

16:33.742 --> 16:34.618
A coincidence?

16:34.868 --> 16:37.287
That he fell ill an hour
after he arrested her

16:37.371 --> 16:39.748
and now he's in a coma
because his brain won't stop swelling?

16:40.040 --> 16:42.418
Okay. You-- You need to tell my dad.

16:42.501 --> 16:44.211
He's not gonna believe us
if we don't have proof.

16:44.294 --> 16:45.629
Us?

16:53.554 --> 16:54.638
Um, Mr. Jackson?

16:55.305 --> 16:57.182
Can we go clean up in the bathroom?

16:58.434 --> 17:00.436
-Vijay spilled and...
-Sure.

17:12.906 --> 17:14.742
<i>Ugh. You look tired!</i>

17:15.200 --> 17:16.660
Race you to the trash can.

17:16.910 --> 17:18.037
Sure. If you want.

17:18.996 --> 17:21.457
Sure you're not gonna poop out on me,
old man?

17:21.707 --> 17:23.792
Hey. First, I'm not an old man.

17:23.917 --> 17:26.795
Second of all, Navy SEALs do not poop.

17:26.879 --> 17:28.839
One, two, three. Go!

17:34.303 --> 17:36.013
Yeah! Ha ha!

17:38.265 --> 17:39.099
Ugh.

17:40.017 --> 17:41.268
-Still got it.
-Uh-huh.

17:43.479 --> 17:44.855
Okay. Okay.

17:44.938 --> 17:46.190
I'll race you to the car.

17:46.690 --> 17:47.649
What, already?

17:47.733 --> 17:50.319
-Yeah. You'll catch up.

17:50.402 --> 17:51.236
Huh.

18:12.216 --> 18:13.467
Hey Dad, do you copy?

18:14.218 --> 18:15.427
Yeah, I'm here.

18:17.012 --> 18:18.263
Hey. How you doin'?

18:18.639 --> 18:21.350
Uh... maybe a little warm.

18:22.601 --> 18:23.977
What's your temperature?

18:25.562 --> 18:26.688
Uh, it's, uh...

18:27.981 --> 18:29.525
A hundred and three.

18:29.608 --> 18:32.444
Dad! That's not a little warm!
What's your BP and heart rate?

18:32.528 --> 18:34.154
<i>Eighty-eight over 50.</i>

18:35.072 --> 18:37.074
And 110.

18:38.283 --> 18:39.576
Are you still bleeding?

18:44.331 --> 18:45.457
Maybe a little more.

18:46.083 --> 18:48.252
You're bleeding into
your abdominal compartment.

19:02.182 --> 19:03.433
Are you still there?

19:05.269 --> 19:08.313
Um... I found a faster route.
I'll be there soon.

19:11.191 --> 19:14.111
<i>Warning. Perimeter fence deactivated.</i>

19:16.280 --> 19:18.824
<i>Warning. You are outside</i>
<i>the perimeter fence.</i>

19:19.158 --> 19:21.160
<i>For your safety, please return.</i>

19:29.835 --> 19:31.295
-Stop looking.
-I'm not.

19:43.515 --> 19:46.518
We don't see each other for seven months
and I'm already trespassing for you.

19:46.602 --> 19:48.604
You are the one who insisted on coming.

19:48.729 --> 19:50.647
Yeah, like I'm really just gonna
give you the code

19:50.731 --> 19:52.316
that unlocks everything on the <i>Resolute.</i>

19:52.399 --> 19:54.776
Oh, the one that you secretly stole
from your dad.

19:54.860 --> 19:56.195
That's different, I guess.

19:58.697 --> 19:59.698
Quick.

20:19.218 --> 20:22.137
Hold on. They program the compactor
to turn on every hour.

20:24.181 --> 20:25.098
Okay...

20:25.849 --> 20:26.725
Yes!

20:27.684 --> 20:28.810
I think we're good.

20:31.939 --> 20:34.566
- Oh.
-Oh.

20:38.820 --> 20:40.280
That is a lot of garbage.

20:43.033 --> 20:46.245
Okay. So we're looking
for a blue trash bag.

20:46.370 --> 20:47.287
You can go first.

20:47.371 --> 20:48.330
This was your idea.

20:51.208 --> 20:52.167
Okay. Fine.

21:08.016 --> 21:09.643
I cannot. I can't do this.

21:09.726 --> 21:12.312
Come on. Just, like,
breathe through your mouth, something.

21:12.396 --> 21:13.939
I don't want it in my mouth.

21:14.022 --> 21:16.525
Okay. That's fine.
Can you just help me up then?

21:16.608 --> 21:17.526
Thank you.

21:20.153 --> 21:20.988
Ah.

21:22.698 --> 21:23.532
Okay.

21:24.324 --> 21:25.784
I'm going to look over here,

21:26.326 --> 21:27.327
you look over there.

22:36.521 --> 22:38.899
<i>Remember these three rules</i>
<i>when you're in the wild.</i>

22:39.524 --> 22:41.443
Could be the difference
between life and death.

22:41.526 --> 22:44.780
Dad, we're going to a campground
with numbered posts.

22:44.863 --> 22:46.281
And a water park.

22:46.365 --> 22:49.618
Never leave food unattended--
You don't want to attract animals.

22:49.701 --> 22:53.038
Rule number two,
always remember your fire protocols.

22:53.455 --> 22:55.415
What's the main cause of forest fires?

22:55.916 --> 22:56.750
Humans.

22:56.833 --> 22:57.876
Humans, that's right.

22:57.959 --> 23:00.462
-Which leads me to rule number three--
-Yeah, yeah, I get it.

23:00.545 --> 23:01.838
I'll text you when I get there.

23:02.714 --> 23:03.924
Hey. What's rule number three?

23:04.007 --> 23:05.550
Uh, accept the unexpected.

23:05.634 --> 23:07.260
When things go wrong,

23:07.344 --> 23:08.970
don't stand around and complain.

23:09.054 --> 23:10.180
Assess your options.

23:10.263 --> 23:11.515
And move forward. Love you! Bye.

23:11.598 --> 23:12.557
Love you, too.

23:15.435 --> 23:16.395
Have fun.

23:33.161 --> 23:34.996
<i>Uh, accept the unexpected.</i>

23:35.622 --> 23:36.998
<i>Assess your options.</i>

23:37.082 --> 23:39.251
<i>And move forward.</i> <i>Love you! Bye.</i>

24:31.803 --> 24:34.222
This is taking forever.
Mr. Jackson is gonna go looking for us

24:34.306 --> 24:36.099
when he realizes
we've been gone for so long.

24:39.436 --> 24:41.730
-Oh, my God.
-What-- Did you find it?

24:44.024 --> 24:45.484
Somebody else brought Oreos.

24:49.154 --> 24:50.197
What are you doing?

24:50.280 --> 24:52.073
Hm? Nothing.

24:52.866 --> 24:54.743
-You were looking in that package.
-No, I wasn't.

24:54.826 --> 24:56.369
You were checking if there was any left.

24:56.453 --> 24:59.331
I-- What kind of a person
do you think I am?

25:01.500 --> 25:03.585
You know, the last time we were together,

25:03.668 --> 25:06.296
we were in a poop cave and now
we're up to our knees in garbage,

25:06.379 --> 25:09.382
so... I wonder if the universe is trying
to tell us something.

25:09.466 --> 25:11.092
Yeah, we stink together.

25:13.720 --> 25:15.430
But we're like friends now, right?

25:15.514 --> 25:18.016
You're the only person I know
on the <i>Resolute,</i> so...

25:18.099 --> 25:20.101
yes. Sure.

25:20.519 --> 25:22.354
Okay, as a friend,
can I ask you something?

25:22.479 --> 25:24.314
As long as you can multitask.

25:28.443 --> 25:30.820
What exactly did you mean
when you said I was a bad kisser?

25:33.323 --> 25:36.159
When we were on that other planet,
you said I was a bad kisser.

25:41.748 --> 25:42.832
We're in a room

25:43.250 --> 25:44.668
that smells like feet

25:45.335 --> 25:46.169
and vomit.

25:47.629 --> 25:49.005
And you want to talk about kissing?

25:49.089 --> 25:51.049
It's just, I've never had
any complaints before so--

25:51.132 --> 25:53.885
-Sorry, I brought your average down.
-Well, was it too much lip?

25:53.969 --> 25:55.512
-Not enough?
-We're really doing this.

25:55.595 --> 25:56.513
Was it my breath?

25:56.596 --> 25:59.432
Because, to be fair, MREs give me
acid reflux and I ran out of gum.

25:59.516 --> 26:00.350
I don't remember--

26:00.433 --> 26:02.352
And also, I tense up
when I'm caught off guard,

26:02.435 --> 26:03.687
which I was that day. I mean--

26:03.770 --> 26:06.356
Usually I can see a kiss coming
from miles away

26:06.439 --> 26:08.316
in which case
I'll do some relaxation tec--

26:08.400 --> 26:09.651
Oh, my God, please stop.

26:10.193 --> 26:12.737
Clearly you've been obsessing over this
for months

26:12.821 --> 26:15.282
and so I'm going to be totally honest
with you.

26:15.740 --> 26:20.287
I may not be the best judge
when it comes to kissing.

26:22.622 --> 26:23.707
But you said that it was--

26:23.790 --> 26:24.791
Yeah, I know what I said.

26:24.874 --> 26:27.669
Just... get a second opinion.

26:29.629 --> 26:30.505
Oh, my God.

26:32.757 --> 26:33.925
I was your first kiss.

26:34.009 --> 26:35.218
And if that were true,

26:35.302 --> 26:37.304
I would like to circle back
to this conversation

26:37.387 --> 26:39.055
when I have something to compare it to.

26:39.139 --> 26:43.184
Now, can we please focus
on stopping a criminal mastermind?

26:46.646 --> 26:47.522
Oh, my God.

26:50.233 --> 26:51.067
I found it.

26:54.237 --> 26:55.196
Empty MRE bag...

26:56.448 --> 26:57.532
a banana peel...

26:59.534 --> 27:00.577
a dirty tissue...

27:02.579 --> 27:03.955
a banana peel.

27:06.124 --> 27:07.917
God, a banana peel.

27:08.001 --> 27:09.836
Smith really loves bananas, I guess.

27:11.630 --> 27:12.505
Wait, hold on.

27:13.340 --> 27:14.924
There's something written on this.

27:15.008 --> 27:16.217
What does it say?

27:20.555 --> 27:21.723
"Killed."

27:35.111 --> 27:36.488
Is that what I think it is?

27:41.743 --> 27:43.453
We gotta get out of here. Come on.

27:44.537 --> 27:45.497
No. No, no, no.

27:45.580 --> 27:46.414
Penny, come on!

27:46.498 --> 27:48.083
I can't-- My foot is stuck.

27:52.462 --> 27:54.130
Come on.

27:54.214 --> 27:55.131
Okay, just pull!

27:55.215 --> 27:56.132
I am pulling!

27:58.593 --> 28:00.095
I'm sorry. I got to go!

28:00.178 --> 28:01.513
Vijay!

28:02.389 --> 28:04.015
Wait, wait, where are you going?

28:04.099 --> 28:05.266
No, no, no.

28:06.059 --> 28:07.352
Vijay!

28:09.229 --> 28:10.313
Where are you going?

28:10.814 --> 28:12.065
Help!

28:14.734 --> 28:16.236
No, no, no, no!

28:16.528 --> 28:18.363
Vijay!

28:34.963 --> 28:36.047
Thanks, Vijay.

28:36.756 --> 28:38.758
If you weren't here to save me, I'd be...

28:40.468 --> 28:42.137
Wait, did you think I had left you?

28:43.138 --> 28:45.890
Uh, because I had to, you know,
go turn off the machine.

28:47.142 --> 28:49.853
I know.  I don't know how else
you would have done it. Nope.

29:09.122 --> 29:10.540
I have a confession to make.

29:10.623 --> 29:11.958
Well, keep it to yourself

29:12.041 --> 29:14.294
'cause I don't want to
have to testify against you.

29:18.423 --> 29:19.841
You were my first kiss too.

29:22.844 --> 29:24.179
Yeah, it's...

29:25.430 --> 29:27.265
it's super obvious in retrospect.

29:29.934 --> 29:30.977
Whoa!

29:47.619 --> 29:48.870
He acts so grown up now,

29:48.995 --> 29:52.332
I forget how young he looks
when he's asleep.

29:52.415 --> 29:55.168
My kids used to fall asleep
whenever we were in the car.

29:56.544 --> 29:57.670
You have children?

29:57.754 --> 30:00.006
Twin boys. A couple years older than Will.

30:01.424 --> 30:02.801
Maybe Penny knows them.

30:02.884 --> 30:05.386
They're already on Alpha Centauri
with my wife.

30:06.638 --> 30:08.640
They were in the fifth colonist group.

30:11.434 --> 30:13.019
You didn't go with them?

30:14.854 --> 30:17.982
My job requires that I travel back
and forth on the <i>Resolute.</i>

30:18.441 --> 30:20.360
Usually three months at a time.

30:20.443 --> 30:21.778
Now you're here.

30:24.405 --> 30:25.490
That's hard.

30:25.573 --> 30:27.075
Thanks to your son,

30:27.617 --> 30:29.369
I have a hope of seeing them again.

30:33.623 --> 30:35.834
So it's a good thing
he passed his test then.

30:37.126 --> 30:38.294
Excuse me?

30:39.254 --> 30:41.256
His records,
they say he had some difficulty

30:41.339 --> 30:43.174
with his pre-qualification training.

30:43.675 --> 30:45.343
But obviously he pulled through.

30:46.052 --> 30:47.387
Yes. He did.

31:10.118 --> 31:12.579
<i>They tore down that park</i>
<i>we used to run in.</i>

31:15.123 --> 31:17.834
I think it's part of a strip mall now.

31:20.628 --> 31:22.422
Yeah, no one runs outside anymore.

31:23.298 --> 31:24.299
Right.

31:25.091 --> 31:26.217
'Cause of the air.

31:32.515 --> 31:35.810
Your mother told me that
you really stepped up when I was away.

31:37.145 --> 31:39.606
Helped Penny and Will
with their homework...

31:41.441 --> 31:42.567
made meals...

31:44.444 --> 31:47.071
all the while studying
for your medical exams.

31:48.323 --> 31:50.742
It's a lot of pressure
for an eighteen-year-old.

31:55.038 --> 31:56.289
Now I'm back.

31:56.956 --> 31:58.541
You don't have to work so hard.

32:00.251 --> 32:01.878
Being with family isn't work.

32:02.795 --> 32:03.671
I didn't mean...

32:05.840 --> 32:07.216
What I-- What I meant was--

32:07.300 --> 32:10.386
That you want things to go back
to how they were before you left Mom?

32:12.472 --> 32:13.723
I didn't...

32:14.098 --> 32:16.142
mean for that to happen.

32:18.728 --> 32:19.771
Now I'm back.

32:21.147 --> 32:22.148
For good.

32:23.441 --> 32:25.068
And we can be a family again.

32:29.322 --> 32:30.281
Look, um...

32:31.532 --> 32:35.912
I get that you feel bad and, uh,
and wanna make it up,

32:36.829 --> 32:40.375
so just make it up to Penny
and Will and Mom, but, um...

32:41.000 --> 32:43.336
Yeah, don't come to Alpha Centauri
on my behalf

32:43.419 --> 32:45.129
'cause I'm doing fine without you.

33:07.068 --> 33:08.319
<i>Judy.</i>

33:09.153 --> 33:10.196
Can you hear me?

33:10.738 --> 33:12.699
Yeah. Just a mile, I'll be there soon.

33:13.866 --> 33:14.826
I know you will.

33:19.539 --> 33:21.207
You know, when I first saw you...

33:24.419 --> 33:25.712
...you were this...

33:26.629 --> 33:28.423
tiny little thing.

33:28.798 --> 33:30.299
<i>But I knew...</i>

33:30.633 --> 33:32.719
<i>that you were gonna be a force of nature.</i>

33:34.512 --> 33:36.055
And when I married your mom...

33:37.473 --> 33:38.766
I promised her...

33:40.101 --> 33:42.103
that I would do everything I could...

33:43.730 --> 33:45.606
to help you become

33:45.732 --> 33:47.734
the person that you were meant to be.

33:50.194 --> 33:51.612
Why are you telling me this?

33:51.696 --> 33:52.655
Listen...

33:54.115 --> 33:55.533
all the tools...

33:56.534 --> 33:58.536
all the things I taught you...

34:00.204 --> 34:01.539
you have them.

34:02.331 --> 34:03.541
You know them by heart.

34:03.624 --> 34:05.585
Read me your vitals.

34:05.668 --> 34:08.087
Read me your vitals.

34:08.171 --> 34:10.381
You don't need your old man anymore.

34:13.551 --> 34:15.928
I know that whatever happens to you
in life...

34:19.474 --> 34:21.100
you're gonna do great.

34:21.726 --> 34:23.269
Great.

34:24.062 --> 34:24.937
Great, okay.

34:25.021 --> 34:27.148
Let me tell you what life will be like
without you.

34:29.150 --> 34:32.153
<i>Mom...</i> <i>will throw herself into work.</i>

34:32.236 --> 34:34.697
She'll grow cold and distant.

34:35.239 --> 34:38.117
Penny's snark will turn bitter
and she'll act out.

34:38.201 --> 34:39.035
<i>And Will...</i>

34:40.119 --> 34:42.955
<i>will retreat into himself.</i>

34:43.664 --> 34:44.707
All that hope,

34:45.708 --> 34:47.543
that light he carries inside of him,

34:47.627 --> 34:50.463
it'll die the second I tell him
that you didn't make it.

34:51.422 --> 34:53.382
<i>And me, well, I'll just--</i>

34:53.466 --> 34:55.551
<i>I'll just do what I always do;</i>

34:56.052 --> 34:58.012
I'll try and keep the family together

34:58.096 --> 34:59.388
because that is my duty.

34:59.972 --> 35:02.391
<i>That's my job because I love them,</i>

35:03.142 --> 35:04.352
but I will hate you.

35:06.437 --> 35:08.439
<i>I will hate you for giving up.</i>

35:08.815 --> 35:11.776
I will hate you
for taking another father

35:12.443 --> 35:13.528
away from me.

35:14.695 --> 35:16.447
<i>-I will hate you </i>

35:17.240 --> 35:18.699
<i>for not loving me enough</i>

35:18.783 --> 35:20.284
<i>-to try harder...</i>

35:22.453 --> 35:23.955
because I need you.

35:28.501 --> 35:30.461
I'm always gonna need you.

35:31.546 --> 35:32.964
<i>And I'm not gonna hate you,</i>

35:33.047 --> 35:34.549
and I'm not letting you go.

36:00.116 --> 36:01.450
<i>Don't let go. Don't let go.</i>

36:01.534 --> 36:03.119
I'm here. I'm right here.

36:12.587 --> 36:13.754
I'm coming, Dad. Stay with me!

36:47.747 --> 36:49.498
Dad? You have the shots.

36:50.291 --> 36:53.294
<i>Give yourself the epinephrine first,</i>
<i>then the antibiotics.</i>

36:55.379 --> 36:56.297
Dad?

37:00.301 --> 37:02.303
Hold the drilling! Hold it!

37:08.100 --> 37:08.935
Dad?

37:09.018 --> 37:10.102
Do you copy?

37:12.563 --> 37:13.397
Dad?

37:19.278 --> 37:20.196
I got it.

37:26.452 --> 37:28.579
Now get me out of this damn well.

37:31.332 --> 37:33.125
-Start it up!

37:45.721 --> 37:47.348
Easy. Easy.

37:48.516 --> 37:49.642
All right.

37:52.353 --> 37:53.187
Okay.

37:53.271 --> 37:54.272
All right, Dad.

37:56.023 --> 37:59.026
I'm just gonna give you an IV,
all right?

37:59.735 --> 38:00.695
Judy.

38:00.778 --> 38:01.988
Judy.

38:02.071 --> 38:03.072
Hi.

38:03.489 --> 38:04.448
Judy.

38:05.116 --> 38:06.200
Judy.

38:06.284 --> 38:08.953
- I am here, Dad.

38:09.203 --> 38:10.746
I'm right here.

38:13.291 --> 38:14.959
I'm right here.

38:17.169 --> 38:18.254
Hey.

38:25.261 --> 38:27.638
Now, the screen on the left
is a vascular plant.

38:27.722 --> 38:31.475
If we zoom in, we can see the tissues
that are used to transport...

38:34.645 --> 38:35.813
What does it say?

38:52.621 --> 38:53.956
Excuse me.

38:55.750 --> 38:57.126
Yes, may I help you?

38:57.668 --> 38:59.670
I'm here to see Penny Robinson.

39:00.254 --> 39:01.339
Are you her mother?

39:02.631 --> 39:03.466
No.

39:03.841 --> 39:05.176
I'm Dr. Zoe Smith,

39:05.259 --> 39:06.969
the therapist in residence.

39:07.636 --> 39:11.223
I just want to see how Penny's doing
with her life back on the <i>Resolute.</i>

39:14.185 --> 39:15.394
Well, it's perfect timing.

39:16.187 --> 39:18.981
Uh, class, we'll continue this tomorrow.

39:24.737 --> 39:26.405
Hi, you're Vijay, right?

39:26.864 --> 39:29.116
I read all about you in Penny's book.

39:30.284 --> 39:32.661
Ah. What's that smell?

39:33.245 --> 39:34.622
Oh, it's you.

39:35.790 --> 39:38.250
I hope my note you found
in the Dumpster was worth it.

39:38.334 --> 39:39.919
I don't know what you're talking about.

39:40.127 --> 39:40.961
Huh.

39:41.504 --> 39:43.422
Curiosity may have killed the cat,

39:44.090 --> 39:46.050
but at least cats don't make it obvious

39:46.133 --> 39:47.635
when they're following someone.

39:48.135 --> 39:49.261
You wanna talk about obvious?

39:49.887 --> 39:50.763
Penny.

39:50.846 --> 39:51.972
What did you do to Radic?

39:52.056 --> 39:52.973
Penny, come on.

39:53.557 --> 39:56.977
You mean besides calling for help
and saving his life?

40:01.941 --> 40:02.817
Penny.

40:02.900 --> 40:04.568
You're not gonna get away this.

40:04.652 --> 40:08.656
You don't understand.
I'm trying to protect you.

40:09.240 --> 40:10.157
Everyone thinks--

40:11.158 --> 40:13.327
No, everyone knows...

40:14.745 --> 40:17.873
that I'm a respected member
of the 24th colonist group.

40:18.416 --> 40:20.000
You need to accept it.

40:21.460 --> 40:23.838
Because if you start making
wild accusations

40:23.921 --> 40:27.174
-that are easily disproven by the facts--
-You made up the facts.

40:27.258 --> 40:29.552
I just don't want people thinking
you're delusional.

40:29.635 --> 40:32.721
-Because I'm Dr. Smith now.

40:34.140 --> 40:35.182
Permanently.

40:37.476 --> 40:38.561
Forever.

40:38.644 --> 40:41.605
It doesn't matter what your name is.
You are who you are.

40:43.149 --> 40:46.986
I know this is a lot to ask,
but can't you just be happy for me?

40:49.697 --> 40:50.698
-Vijay.

41:13.721 --> 41:16.098
This metal ring in your report.

41:17.349 --> 41:19.018
Was wondering when that was gonna come up.

41:19.101 --> 41:21.937
What if I was to tell you
that this wasn't the only one?

41:23.147 --> 41:26.192
That the planet we're headed to,
there's one there as well?

41:26.775 --> 41:28.277
It seems to be the same as yours.

41:28.360 --> 41:30.613
The electrical storm hits it
every 23 days.

41:31.238 --> 41:35.910
We've been hesitant to get anywhere close,
but in typical Robinson fashion,

41:36.035 --> 41:39.163
you find yourself right
in the middle of one. So, uh...

41:39.663 --> 41:41.332
Any theories as to what they are?

41:41.749 --> 41:43.834
I assumed it had something to do
with the lightning.

41:43.918 --> 41:47.004
I mean, you don't build something that big
as an art project.

41:47.838 --> 41:49.465
It has to have a purpose.

41:51.217 --> 41:53.302
Now these glyphs on the surface,

41:53.385 --> 41:56.263
our linguists haven't been able to make
heads or tails of what they mean.

41:56.347 --> 41:58.349
When we find my robot down there,

41:59.099 --> 42:00.100
we can ask him.

42:02.228 --> 42:03.979
Let's just hope we like the answer.
