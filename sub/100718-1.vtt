01:01.426 --> 01:04.193
Trey, check upstairs.
Make sure we're alone.

01:04.194 --> 01:06.132
Noah, you on lookout.

01:09.168 --> 01:12.072
Holy shit.
Shooter, we made it.

01:14.606 --> 01:17.209
Not bad, badass little bro.

01:18.777 --> 01:21.311
Not bad for your first job,
but check it.

01:21.313 --> 01:24.814
It ain't over till we get
through the border, you feel me?

01:24.816 --> 01:28.854
Stash this cash
just in case we get company.

03:23.801 --> 03:25.304
Bobby?

03:33.044 --> 03:34.310
What was that noise?

03:34.312 --> 03:36.579
I tripped. We're all clear.

03:36.581 --> 03:38.614
I ditched the van.

03:38.616 --> 03:39.615
Jesus!

03:39.617 --> 03:40.684
Fuck, man!

03:40.686 --> 03:41.817
The van's down by the junkyard.

03:41.819 --> 03:43.919
It's about a quarter mile away.

03:43.921 --> 03:45.788
Where the hell's Bobby?

03:45.790 --> 03:48.424
Told him to stash the cash.
He'll be back in a minute.

03:48.426 --> 03:50.827
What do you mean,
stash it?

03:50.829 --> 03:53.530
Where's the goddamn money?

03:53.532 --> 03:56.933
You tell your brother
to unstash a fifth of that cash

03:56.935 --> 03:59.903
right fucking now!

04:01.573 --> 04:02.609
Bobby!

04:03.776 --> 04:04.808
What happened?

04:04.810 --> 04:07.411
W-We gotta get out of here.

04:07.413 --> 04:08.612
Where's the money?!

04:08.614 --> 04:10.413
They didn't get it.

04:10.415 --> 04:11.748
What happened?
What are you talking about?

04:11.750 --> 04:13.716
There's something down there.

04:13.718 --> 04:16.320
- Where's the...
- Shut the fuck up!

04:16.322 --> 04:17.887
I put it in a...

04:19.791 --> 04:23.760
Bobby! Bobby!

04:23.762 --> 04:25.564
What the fuck?

04:34.406 --> 04:36.673
Shit!

04:36.675 --> 04:38.074
Trey.

04:38.076 --> 04:39.875
Trey, you okay?

04:39.877 --> 04:41.046
Trey!

04:53.692 --> 04:55.091
Fuck!

04:55.093 --> 04:57.928
No!

04:57.930 --> 05:00.363
No!

05:00.365 --> 05:03.399
No! No! No!

05:03.401 --> 05:04.503
No!

06:21.814 --> 06:23.816
Come on. I'll finish fast.

06:26.084 --> 06:28.551
I have to get to work.

06:28.553 --> 06:30.553
You still got almost
three minutes.

06:30.555 --> 06:33.089
My truck's too high
for anyone to see.

06:33.091 --> 06:34.093
No.

07:00.918 --> 07:03.786
Had you just done it while I was
driving like I told you to,

07:03.788 --> 07:05.755
we wouldn't be having
this problem now, would we?

07:05.757 --> 07:07.759
You are absolutely unbelievable.

07:13.798 --> 07:15.767
- Just fucking do it!
- No.

07:17.569 --> 07:18.571
Do it!

07:27.512 --> 07:30.279
You just made the biggest
mistake of your life!

07:32.884 --> 07:35.050
Where I just came from,

07:35.052 --> 07:38.522
any little gump in the yard
could've tuned you up.

07:38.524 --> 07:40.492
You don't wanna go
a round with me, boy.

08:10.656 --> 08:12.822
Deej, I need that
steak and eggs, table six,

08:12.824 --> 08:14.794
five minutes ago!

08:34.278 --> 08:36.278
What can I help you with?

08:36.280 --> 08:37.847
You got a restroom?

08:37.849 --> 08:39.315
Sure.

08:39.317 --> 08:40.749
Oh, my God, Sherry.

08:40.751 --> 08:42.650
- What happened to your face?
- Mom...

08:42.653 --> 08:45.155
Don't Mom me.
Tell me what happened.

08:45.157 --> 08:48.027
I'm fine. Thanks to him.

08:51.964 --> 08:54.233
Bathroom's around the corner.

08:57.836 --> 09:00.136
Look, at least let me
get some ice to put on it.

09:00.138 --> 09:02.675
Okay. Can you leave me alone?

09:38.777 --> 09:40.613
You clean up nice.

09:48.919 --> 09:51.353
- Here's your change.
- Oh, no. Keep the change.

09:51.355 --> 09:53.989
Thank you.

09:53.991 --> 09:57.160
You gonna be okay?
Would you like for us to stay?

09:57.162 --> 09:59.695
Apparently, this gentleman
is a Good Samaritan, Remo.

09:59.697 --> 10:01.967
I think we'll be okay.

10:03.902 --> 10:08.374
Really nice what you did
out there. Thank you.

10:10.341 --> 10:12.842
Lunch is on the house today.

10:12.844 --> 10:17.180
I appreciate that, and I will
definitely take a rain check.

10:17.182 --> 10:19.848
But I was wondering
if you could give me

10:19.850 --> 10:22.919
a little more information
about this job here.

10:22.921 --> 10:25.220
Oh, that's a big commitment,
that one.

10:25.222 --> 10:27.223
I don't think
you want to tackle that.

10:27.225 --> 10:28.824
Yeah, that place is a shithole.

10:28.826 --> 10:30.426
Watch your language.

10:30.428 --> 10:34.033
What? I'm sure he doesn't mind.
Just got out of prison.

10:35.801 --> 10:38.334
Sorry. I heard you say
something about "the yard."

10:38.336 --> 10:40.103
I did some time.

10:40.105 --> 10:41.938
When?

10:41.940 --> 10:44.807
I got out yesterday.

10:44.809 --> 10:47.444
Hey, you guys
got any beer here?

10:47.446 --> 10:50.079
Just have root beer.

10:50.081 --> 10:51.748
Anything for grownups?

10:51.750 --> 10:52.949
Coffee.

10:52.951 --> 10:54.450
- That works.
- Great.

10:54.452 --> 10:55.819
Can you get him
a cup of coffee?

10:55.821 --> 10:58.090
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

10:59.323 --> 11:01.394
So you got family
around here?

11:02.494 --> 11:05.228
Nope. Just looking for work.

11:05.230 --> 11:07.229
Can I use your phone?

11:07.231 --> 11:09.866
I'll tell you what.
For what you did for Sherry,

11:09.868 --> 11:11.468
how 'bout you at least
let me get you a piece of pie

11:11.470 --> 11:13.002
to go with that coffee?

11:13.004 --> 11:14.771
Then I can give Father John
a call for you,

11:14.773 --> 11:15.872
put in a good word.

11:15.874 --> 11:17.473
He's the owner of the place.

11:17.475 --> 11:18.941
I appreciate that.

11:18.943 --> 11:20.209
Make yourself at home.

11:20.211 --> 11:21.980
Thank you.

11:38.864 --> 11:41.498
<i>What you gonna do
when you get out of here,</i>

11:41.500 --> 11:42.701
<i>besides get laid?</i>

11:45.437 --> 11:48.106
<i>Ain't like I got
a whole lot of options.</i>

12:07.993 --> 12:10.526
Checkmate.

12:10.528 --> 12:14.263
See, sometimes you gotta
throw the battle

12:14.265 --> 12:15.967
to win the war.

12:16.999 --> 12:18.002
You understand
what I'm saying?

12:30.816 --> 12:32.248
Hey, boy.

12:32.250 --> 12:34.186
Boy!

12:38.923 --> 12:42.157
Now, you better have
a very good reason

12:42.159 --> 12:45.427
for laying your hands
on my own son.

12:45.429 --> 12:48.998
I'm just not keen on guys
who smack around young ladies.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.901
Ask the girl inside
with the ice pack.

12:51.903 --> 12:54.036
She'll give you
all the details.

12:54.038 --> 12:55.438
Have a good one.

12:55.440 --> 12:57.009
Wait a minute.

12:59.476 --> 13:02.377
My boy's blade.
That's a family heirloom.

13:02.379 --> 13:05.518
I guess I'm gonna have
to start a family.

13:15.427 --> 13:18.330
I thought you said
this was a nice neighborhood.

14:13.083 --> 14:16.920
Hello. I'm guessing you're the
fella that's looking for a job.

14:16.922 --> 14:20.089
- I didn't mean to interrupt.
- Nah, don't worry about them.

14:20.091 --> 14:23.225
Couple of businessmen talking
about making an investment.

14:23.227 --> 14:24.294
I'm John.

14:24.296 --> 14:26.195
Crimson Matthews.

14:26.197 --> 14:27.997
Crimson Matthews.

14:27.999 --> 14:31.367
Crimson's a interesting name.

14:31.369 --> 14:34.369
Jan at the diner called you
"Father John." You a priest?

14:34.371 --> 14:38.107
Guilty. I am the shepherd
of this little town.

14:38.109 --> 14:39.975
Jan at the diner
also tells me

14:39.977 --> 14:43.680
you were recently released
from the services of the state.

14:43.682 --> 14:47.116
Is that gonna be a problem?

14:47.118 --> 14:50.486
Nah. See, I figure it's
what's on the inside of a man

14:50.488 --> 14:53.455
that counts anyway, right?

14:53.457 --> 14:56.158
Why don't you
take a look inside,

14:56.160 --> 14:58.096
see if you're up
for the job.

15:04.269 --> 15:07.103
What exactly you want done in
here, and how much you paying?

15:07.105 --> 15:09.973
Well, assuming I hire you on,

15:09.975 --> 15:12.675
pay is 400 bucks a week,

15:12.677 --> 15:15.578
plus you get to stay here
rent free.

15:15.580 --> 15:18.448
Here? Delightful.

15:18.450 --> 15:21.283
Yeah.

15:21.285 --> 15:23.286
I need you to clean
the old girl up a little bit.

15:23.288 --> 15:25.121
I'm gonna hire
a professional crew to come in,

15:25.123 --> 15:27.290
do the electrical,
the plumbing, the carpets,

15:27.292 --> 15:29.157
things like that.

15:29.159 --> 15:31.060
You get her nice and clean,
couple coats of paint,

15:31.062 --> 15:33.195
that ought to do the job.

15:33.197 --> 15:35.631
Give me a week
and a ton of bleach

15:35.633 --> 15:38.233
and see if you like
my work.

15:38.235 --> 15:40.502
I promise you it can't get
any worse than it already is.

15:40.504 --> 15:44.373
Hey, hey, hey!
She can hear you, you know.

15:44.375 --> 15:46.142
- What a shithole.
- All right.

15:46.144 --> 15:50.012
I'll give you a week.
Come on out. Musty in there.

15:50.014 --> 15:54.217
All right,
here is $400 in advance

15:54.219 --> 15:57.020
and 500 for supplies.

15:57.022 --> 15:59.254
I warn you, there is electricity
but it's ornery,

15:59.256 --> 16:01.491
just like the rest of
the old girl, so be careful.

16:01.493 --> 16:04.560
You said supplies.
I'm on foot.

16:04.562 --> 16:06.161
Oh, no problem.
Use my truck.

16:06.163 --> 16:07.696
I do need a ride
into town though.

16:07.698 --> 16:09.699
Is there a basement?

16:09.701 --> 16:11.700
Someplace that I can
put the tools?

16:11.702 --> 16:14.603
Well, not really.

16:14.605 --> 16:16.272
There were
servants' quarters out back,

16:16.274 --> 16:18.107
a bunch of tunnels
that led to the basement.

16:18.109 --> 16:20.709
Once they started to cave in,
we filled in the whole business.

16:20.711 --> 16:23.512
There's a door inside, but
it's been locked up permanent.

16:23.514 --> 16:25.381
How recent did that happen?

16:25.383 --> 16:27.749
About a decade. Why?

16:27.751 --> 16:29.584
I appreciate the job.

16:29.586 --> 16:33.222
I figure if you can give the old
girl a second chance at life,

16:33.224 --> 16:35.458
I can do the same thing for you.

16:35.460 --> 16:36.559
Thank you.

16:36.561 --> 16:38.697
Absolutely. You drive.

16:51.076 --> 16:53.443
Man, come on!
Can we just go home?

16:53.445 --> 16:56.445
No way. I'm tired of Donnie
winning every year,

16:56.447 --> 16:58.580
especially when he talks about
how many chicks he nails

16:58.582 --> 17:00.385
over there.

17:12.297 --> 17:15.034
Look at this place, Tommy.
Nobody lives here.

17:18.569 --> 17:20.204
Hello!

17:24.442 --> 17:26.275
Hello!

17:26.277 --> 17:29.112
We'd like a moment of your time
to talk about God.

17:29.114 --> 17:32.315
Yeah, that always works.
Can we just leave, man?

17:32.317 --> 17:35.319
I hear something.
I'm gonna go check around back.

17:56.641 --> 17:58.310
Tommy?

18:03.413 --> 18:04.650
Hello?

18:14.659 --> 18:15.594
Hello?

18:19.631 --> 18:21.400
Is anybody there?

18:47.291 --> 18:48.757
So...

18:48.759 --> 18:50.726
I heard you got the job.

18:50.728 --> 18:53.629
I got a week
to prove myself anyway.

18:53.631 --> 18:55.297
Thanks for putting in
a good word.

18:55.299 --> 18:57.232
It's the least
I could do for ya.

18:57.234 --> 18:59.334
So you're sticking around.

18:59.336 --> 19:00.835
At least for dinner.

19:00.837 --> 19:02.537
I was hoping for a sandwich
or something.

19:02.539 --> 19:04.673
Hamburgers and coffee?

19:04.675 --> 19:06.177
Perfect.

19:08.913 --> 19:11.680
So what's with this Father John?

19:11.682 --> 19:15.450
Priest? Slumlord?
Real estate baron?

19:15.452 --> 19:17.819
I mean, there were two
pretty swanky investors up there

19:17.821 --> 19:19.822
when I showed up earlier today.

19:19.824 --> 19:21.824
He's the benefactor.

19:21.826 --> 19:23.726
Basically, the glue
that holds this town together

19:23.728 --> 19:25.661
since the mill closed down.

19:25.663 --> 19:27.963
I got behind on my lease here
a couple years ago.

19:27.965 --> 19:30.868
He loaned me money,
no questions asked.

19:33.238 --> 19:34.870
Tell him about Ray.

19:34.872 --> 19:38.240
That crazy guy?
What about him?

19:38.242 --> 19:39.976
He owned the mill.

19:39.978 --> 19:43.411
His wife Annie
was the prettiest gal in town.

19:43.413 --> 19:44.980
Yeah. He lived in
the house you're fixing up

19:44.982 --> 19:46.784
before I was born.

19:47.852 --> 19:49.751
Really?

19:49.753 --> 19:54.257
Yeah. When the mill closed,
Ray was ruined.

19:54.259 --> 19:55.991
His wife Annie got real sick

19:55.993 --> 19:58.960
about the time Father John
came to town.

19:58.962 --> 20:00.962
If it hadn't been for him
paying their mortgage,

20:00.964 --> 20:03.365
their hospital bills
till Annie died,

20:03.367 --> 20:05.500
I don't know
what Ray would've done.

20:05.502 --> 20:08.336
Doesn't look like he's paying
his bills anymore.

20:08.338 --> 20:11.539
He just doesn't like
taking handouts from people,

20:11.541 --> 20:15.644
and, well, he went downhill fast
once his wife died.

20:15.646 --> 20:17.846
So this Father John,

20:17.848 --> 20:19.882
has he had money
for quite a while?

20:19.884 --> 20:21.651
No. He's always been generous.

20:21.653 --> 20:24.420
No one really knows
where it came from.

20:24.422 --> 20:26.288
Probably rich family, maybe.

20:26.290 --> 20:28.824
So...

20:28.826 --> 20:30.825
we close tonight at eight,

20:30.827 --> 20:34.330
but I'm not opposed
to a man buying me dinner.

20:34.332 --> 20:36.832
I didn't think there was
another restaurant in this town.

20:36.834 --> 20:38.534
Well, no, but...

20:38.536 --> 20:40.969
I was thinking maybe we could
have steaks at my place.

20:40.971 --> 20:45.841
"Steaks at my place."
No one says no to that!

20:45.843 --> 20:48.510
Ray! No, Ray!

20:48.512 --> 20:51.046
Ray, no! No, wha...

20:51.048 --> 20:52.782
I'm so sorry.

20:52.784 --> 20:54.616
Come on, Ray.
Just sit down.

20:54.618 --> 20:56.554
No harm, no foul.

20:58.722 --> 21:01.757
Maybe some other time.
Thanks for this.

21:01.759 --> 21:04.559
Okay.

21:04.561 --> 21:06.764
See you around.

23:39.584 --> 23:41.182
<i>Three years
we been cellmates.</i>

23:41.184 --> 23:43.017
<i>Yeah.</i>

23:43.019 --> 23:45.854
<i>Not once have you asked
why I'm here.</i>

23:45.856 --> 23:47.792
<i>If you wanted me to know,
you would've told me.</i>

23:49.559 --> 23:53.161
<i>Seein' this is
our last game,</i>

23:53.163 --> 23:54.766
<i>I figure it's time.</i>

23:58.736 --> 24:01.173
<i>I got a big favor
to ask you, bro.</i>

26:44.902 --> 26:46.168
Yes?

26:46.170 --> 26:47.736
Well, good morning.

26:47.738 --> 26:49.171
I'm glad to see
that you're still here.

26:49.173 --> 26:50.738
We brought you breakfast.

26:50.740 --> 26:52.074
Oh, hey, thanks.

26:52.076 --> 26:54.776
I'm actually
just on my way out.

26:54.778 --> 26:57.680
I would've given you a call,
but I didn't have your number.

26:57.682 --> 27:00.349
Gonna get a cell phone today.
That is one of my errands.

27:00.351 --> 27:02.918
Well, my number's
on the donuts.

27:02.920 --> 27:05.821
- Where do you sleep?
- Upstairs.

27:05.823 --> 27:09.190
He should stay with us.
You could sleep on our couch.

27:09.192 --> 27:10.992
Yes. I can't imagine a person
wanting to stay

27:10.994 --> 27:11.994
at a place like this.

27:11.996 --> 27:13.862
It must be full of critters.

27:13.864 --> 27:15.764
As a matter of fact,
I'm off to buy rodent killer

27:15.766 --> 27:17.165
as we speak.

27:17.167 --> 27:18.734
Oh. Well, the offer
still stands.

27:18.736 --> 27:20.134
- Yup!
- Bye.

27:20.136 --> 27:21.839
Bye!

27:28.244 --> 27:30.411
So how much extra cash
will it take

27:30.413 --> 27:32.280
to get one
without the waiting period?

27:32.282 --> 27:33.481
Look, Mister...

27:33.483 --> 27:34.783
Crimson. It's Crimson.

27:34.785 --> 27:35.883
Crimson.

27:35.885 --> 27:37.719
I can't sell you a gun here,

27:37.721 --> 27:39.321
not without observing
all the laws.

27:39.323 --> 27:41.222
And wouldn't it violate
your parole anyway?

27:41.224 --> 27:43.193
Fucking small towns.

27:45.962 --> 27:48.332
You know where I can
find a Tracfone?

28:02.145 --> 28:03.312
You got here fast.

28:03.314 --> 28:06.183
When you call, I ride.

28:08.051 --> 28:12.054
Besides, you big sumbitch,
I heard you just got out.

28:12.056 --> 28:13.822
Awesome, man.

28:13.824 --> 28:16.158
I was kinda thinking though

28:16.160 --> 28:18.026
you would've come
straight into the city though.

28:18.028 --> 28:20.863
I got some shit to take care of.

28:20.865 --> 28:23.332
Don't take too long, man.

28:23.334 --> 28:27.001
Some people are already starting
to wonder where you are.

28:27.003 --> 28:29.904
I bet. You bring me something?

28:29.906 --> 28:32.443
Yeah, I got something for ya.

28:39.884 --> 28:42.785
And you don't want to
go to war without this.

28:42.787 --> 28:46.455
And I had a feeling you were
gonna get kinda bloody, so...

28:46.457 --> 28:48.055
I brought you two.

28:48.057 --> 28:49.525
Thanks.

28:49.527 --> 28:52.361
Make 'em bleed, my brotha.

28:52.363 --> 28:55.266
But don't tell anybody
where you got that shit from.

29:00.336 --> 29:02.103
You sure you're not gonna
need any help?

29:02.105 --> 29:05.009
Nah. This one's for a friend.

29:07.310 --> 29:10.280
But what's in it for you
this time?

29:14.050 --> 29:17.553
All right, all right,
I got it.

29:17.555 --> 29:19.023
I'm outta here.

29:24.327 --> 29:26.327
See you on the other side,
motherfucker.

29:42.145 --> 29:44.379
- How you doing, sweetheart?
- Fine.

29:44.381 --> 29:46.448
Say, I talked
to my dunderhead boy.

29:46.450 --> 29:49.918
He just feels terrible about
that little fight you all had.

29:49.920 --> 29:52.921
Are you trying to tell me
that I deserve it?

29:52.923 --> 29:56.461
Oh, no, no, why would I do that?
That'd be totally inappropriate.

29:59.563 --> 30:01.630
I tell you though,
while I got your attention,

30:01.632 --> 30:04.298
I would like to mention
that you, your mom,

30:04.300 --> 30:06.334
you're cozying up
to this new guy in town,

30:06.336 --> 30:08.536
and you know as well as I do,

30:08.538 --> 30:09.904
he ain't gonna be
around for long.

30:09.906 --> 30:11.606
Know what I mean?

30:11.608 --> 30:14.176
No, what does that mean?

30:14.178 --> 30:16.577
Well, it means I...
I done looked him up,

30:16.579 --> 30:19.614
and he's done a lot of bad
things to a lot of bad people.

30:19.616 --> 30:22.651
Now, that ain't so bad.
They're all bad. Who cares?

30:22.653 --> 30:27.288
But some of the people,
they end up gone, missing, dead.

30:27.290 --> 30:30.124
I'd just hate to see you be part
of that collateral damage,

30:30.126 --> 30:31.461
your pretty little face,
you know?

30:34.431 --> 30:37.999
I think I can make my own choice
about the company I keep.

30:38.001 --> 30:42.069
You know, in this town we all
like to take care of our own.

30:42.071 --> 30:44.541
Best you and your mom
remember that.

30:48.412 --> 30:50.048
Got it.

30:51.181 --> 30:52.546
Call the boy.

30:52.548 --> 30:54.985
He's brokenhearted.

33:29.138 --> 33:30.440
What the fuck?

34:14.418 --> 34:15.784
Ah...

34:17.353 --> 34:19.286
Yeah, that's how it's done,
bitches.

34:20.389 --> 34:21.822
That's how it's done.

34:21.824 --> 34:23.724
Where's Elijah?
He's not even here yet.

34:26.429 --> 34:28.463
What the fuck do you think
you're doing?

34:28.465 --> 34:30.831
Oh, this dick's got a gun.

34:30.833 --> 34:33.235
Get that light out of my face
or... What's your name?

34:33.237 --> 34:35.536
- Elijah.
- Elijah loses his teeth.

34:35.539 --> 34:37.542
- Please just do what he says.
- Shut up!

34:38.708 --> 34:40.610
Turn the light on.

34:43.213 --> 34:45.679
So you were the little shits
here last night, too, huh?

34:45.681 --> 34:48.349
You got ten seconds to get
the fuck out of my house.

34:48.351 --> 34:50.751
Oh, your house? Who you think
you're talking to, huh, bitch?

34:50.753 --> 34:53.655
You think you're fuckin' tough
with that gun, huh?

34:53.657 --> 34:57.224
What is with all these
little shits in this town?

34:57.226 --> 34:59.628
He speaking for all of you?
'Cause if he is,

34:59.630 --> 35:01.463
I'm wasting you all
on principle alone.

35:01.465 --> 35:03.430
No, no.
Joe's a fucking idiot.

35:03.432 --> 35:05.300
He doesn't run shit
but his mouth.

35:05.302 --> 35:06.934
- We're not even from here.
- We met this kid downtown.

35:06.936 --> 35:08.802
- His name was...
- Tony!

35:08.804 --> 35:10.871
He said that we should come
party here. We didn't know.

35:10.873 --> 35:12.773
He didn't say anyone lived here.

35:12.775 --> 35:15.443
That little shit. He sent you
here last night too, didn't he?

35:15.445 --> 35:17.845
We weren't here last night.

35:17.847 --> 35:19.180
I swear.

35:20.650 --> 35:22.717
What's that?

35:22.719 --> 35:24.889
Get out. Now!

35:32.795 --> 35:34.397
Joe!

36:02.358 --> 36:03.693
Leave her alone.

37:10.460 --> 37:12.693
It was a fucking bloody mess
in there, man.

37:12.695 --> 37:14.996
Took out three of my guys
like it was nothing.

37:14.998 --> 37:16.498
They got Bobby.

37:16.500 --> 37:18.633
They got my little brother, man.

37:18.635 --> 37:21.836
See, but I was lucky.

37:21.838 --> 37:26.675
I ran like hell,
but I wasn't thinking straight.

37:26.677 --> 37:28.776
Ran straight out of town,

37:28.778 --> 37:30.612
right into a state trooper

37:30.614 --> 37:32.914
with my picture
sitting on his passenger seat.

37:32.916 --> 37:34.449
What'd you tell him?

37:34.451 --> 37:36.885
I told him what any brother
would tell him.

37:36.887 --> 37:38.623
I told him to fuck off.

37:40.724 --> 37:44.992
Naw, man,
but I didn't want that cop

37:44.994 --> 37:47.628
to go find that money
in that basement.

37:47.630 --> 37:50.764
Money my brother died for.

37:50.766 --> 37:54.802
So I told him
my guys turned on me,

37:54.804 --> 37:56.740
took the cash...

37:59.409 --> 38:00.909
headed straight for the border.

38:00.911 --> 38:02.644
Sounds believable.

38:02.646 --> 38:04.412
See, but that's where
you come in.

38:04.414 --> 38:07.081
You been like a brother to me.

38:07.083 --> 38:08.717
Look.

38:08.719 --> 38:12.757
$3 million in that basement.

38:17.927 --> 38:21.528
I want you to find it
before somebody else does.

38:21.530 --> 38:25.467
And I want you to find
those motherfuckers

38:25.469 --> 38:28.369
and then fuck 'em up real good,
you feel me?

38:28.371 --> 38:31.775
You do that, half is yours.

38:33.543 --> 38:35.577
That I can do.

38:35.579 --> 38:39.847
Look whatever's in there
is for real.

38:39.849 --> 38:42.050
But hear me on this.

38:42.052 --> 38:46.688
Shit go bad,
I need you to bounce.

38:46.690 --> 38:50.124
Look, man, sometimes...

38:50.126 --> 38:52.559
you gotta sacrifice the queen

38:52.561 --> 38:54.898
to win the war.

39:20.090 --> 39:22.626
You drop that gun, boy.

39:24.994 --> 39:27.397
And the backpack.

39:30.032 --> 39:31.465
Officer, look...

39:31.467 --> 39:33.034
That's Sheriff.

39:33.036 --> 39:34.702
Fine. Sheriff.

39:34.704 --> 39:36.704
Don't you forget
where you are.

39:36.706 --> 39:40.208
You're in my town.

39:40.210 --> 39:42.043
Now here's what
I want you to do.

39:42.045 --> 39:45.713
Just so we all know
what's what.

39:45.715 --> 39:48.215
Why don't you put your hands
on your head

39:48.217 --> 39:50.587
and get down on your knees.

39:53.023 --> 39:57.027
Little faster, I think.
On your knees.

39:58.929 --> 40:00.929
That's good.

40:00.931 --> 40:06.633
Now, I've been gettin' some
noise complaints around here.

40:06.635 --> 40:08.869
You know anything
about that, boy?

40:08.871 --> 40:11.104
I really wouldn't go in there
if I were you.

40:11.106 --> 40:14.512
Oh. You make a mess in there?

40:15.679 --> 40:17.679
You really had to be there.

40:17.681 --> 40:20.451
I bet you're right.

40:25.688 --> 40:28.826
Shit.

40:58.288 --> 41:01.054
- The eyes.
- Ray.

41:01.056 --> 41:03.660
- Ray.
- The eyes.

41:05.295 --> 41:07.528
The eyes are the windows
to the soul.

41:07.530 --> 41:10.030
I don't need
my windows washed, Ray.

41:10.032 --> 41:11.865
Don't let them steal
your windows.

41:11.867 --> 41:14.135
Put your shirt back on, Ray.

41:14.137 --> 41:17.170
Go home.

41:17.172 --> 41:18.107
Go home!

42:02.351 --> 42:03.686
Hello?

42:11.061 --> 42:12.162
Crimson?

42:14.130 --> 42:15.699
Father John?

42:28.143 --> 42:29.712
Hello?

43:37.746 --> 43:38.882
Hello?

44:22.291 --> 44:23.356
Crimson.

44:23.358 --> 44:26.094
Shh...

44:29.998 --> 44:32.400
What the hell is that?

44:32.402 --> 44:34.202
You're riling 'em up.

44:34.204 --> 44:35.305
Who?

44:37.940 --> 44:39.740
The freaks.

44:39.742 --> 44:41.811
What?

44:58.393 --> 44:59.429
Hey!

45:02.164 --> 45:03.933
Don't.

45:14.543 --> 45:16.913
I'm gonna get us out of this.
We're gonna be okay.

45:20.083 --> 45:21.318
Oh, man.

45:41.838 --> 45:43.974
We're gonna be okay.

45:55.083 --> 45:56.286
Crimson!

46:16.472 --> 46:17.441
Crimson!

46:19.275 --> 46:22.246
Please. Please.

46:25.547 --> 46:28.384
No! No!

46:32.521 --> 46:37.191
At first, I thought you were
a federal officer of some kind,

46:37.193 --> 46:42.362
or maybe an undercover cop

46:42.364 --> 46:44.365
come here to shut us down.

46:44.367 --> 46:47.568
But, lucky for me,

46:47.570 --> 46:50.271
you are nothing more
than a common criminal.

46:50.273 --> 46:55.943
A criminal of low intelligence
and vainglorious pride.

46:55.945 --> 47:00.081
A blight on all decent society.

47:00.083 --> 47:02.418
I thought it's what's inside
that counts.

47:05.088 --> 47:06.390
Oh.

47:08.490 --> 47:10.159
It is.

47:14.563 --> 47:15.932
No. No!

47:28.411 --> 47:31.579
Oh, we get all kinds in here,
Mr. Matthews.

47:31.581 --> 47:35.950
Vagrants,
children looking for places

47:35.952 --> 47:37.485
to hold for their
sex and drugs parties.

47:37.487 --> 47:38.653
It's just awful.

47:38.655 --> 47:40.220
Bible salesmen.

47:40.222 --> 47:42.657
Bible salesmen!

47:42.659 --> 47:46.126
In fact, you're not
the first criminal we've had

47:46.128 --> 47:48.561
bless our halls, my friend.

47:48.563 --> 47:53.166
I seem to recall
several years ago,

47:53.168 --> 47:55.302
an entire group of criminals
came here

47:55.304 --> 47:57.604
and used these glorious walls
of hers

47:57.606 --> 47:59.706
to hold up
and hide the spoils

47:59.708 --> 48:01.878
of their recent
robbery activity.

48:03.980 --> 48:05.179
You found the money.

48:05.181 --> 48:07.414
Yeah, we found the money.

48:07.416 --> 48:10.251
That very night,
we found the money.

48:10.253 --> 48:11.719
How else do you suppose
we were able to afford

48:11.721 --> 48:14.988
the upgrade to
our beautiful new facility?

48:14.990 --> 48:18.059
Facility for what?

48:18.061 --> 48:20.260
Oh, you would be shocked
to find out

48:20.262 --> 48:22.963
how many lucrative and wonderful
ways there are to make money

48:22.965 --> 48:24.298
in this modern age, my friend.

48:26.101 --> 48:30.271
Do you know that if you were to
harvest each salable component...

48:30.273 --> 48:32.173
kidneys, liver, marrow, blood...

48:32.175 --> 48:37.211
that every human body is worth
potentially nearly $45 million?

48:37.213 --> 48:39.512
Hmm? Consider this:

48:39.514 --> 48:42.316
A gram of bone marrow
is worth more than $20 thousand.

48:42.318 --> 48:45.987
A kidney,
more than $200 thousand.

48:45.989 --> 48:48.188
Now, admittedly,
it is a little tricky

48:48.190 --> 48:49.623
creating a steady supply,

48:49.625 --> 48:52.226
but with the help
of some of Chesterton's

48:52.228 --> 48:53.661
more desperate residents,

48:53.663 --> 48:56.664
we do manage to make it work.

48:56.666 --> 48:58.666
You'd be amazed at how far
these people have gone

48:58.668 --> 49:00.266
to save their town.

49:03.206 --> 49:05.039
No! Please!

49:05.041 --> 49:07.675
Please!

49:07.677 --> 49:11.012
So I'm betting
you ain't really a preacher.

49:11.014 --> 49:14.481
On the contrary, my friend.
Romans 12:1.

49:14.483 --> 49:18.385
"I appeal to you, therefore,
brothers, by the mercies of God,

49:18.387 --> 49:20.653
to present your bodies
as a living sacrifice,

49:20.655 --> 49:23.523
holy and acceptable to God,

49:23.525 --> 49:26.226
which is
your spiritual worship."

49:26.228 --> 49:29.764
You see, I merely allow people
to give as God wishes.

49:29.766 --> 49:31.735
And I make a whole
assload of money at it.

49:41.244 --> 49:44.077
Please.

49:45.280 --> 49:48.382
Help! No! Help!

49:50.253 --> 49:52.119
What the hell's
he doing to her?

49:52.121 --> 49:54.588
Oh, I doubt he's doing anything
more than operating the cameras.

49:54.590 --> 49:58.325
You see, my clientele for his
particular genre of filmmaking

49:58.327 --> 50:00.260
is somewhat esoteric.

50:00.262 --> 50:03.097
That's probably one or more
of his creations'

50:03.099 --> 50:04.764
sexual appetites at play,

50:04.766 --> 50:08.702
which brings me to you.

50:08.704 --> 50:11.639
At first, I'd hoped that even
with your life of debauchery,

50:11.641 --> 50:14.075
you would at least have taken
good enough care of yourself

50:14.077 --> 50:16.110
to be worth a few thousand
dollars to me,

50:16.112 --> 50:20.414
but when I heard of how you
fought off one of Danny's pets,

50:20.416 --> 50:23.184
how could I possibly resist
adding you to the collection?

50:24.353 --> 50:25.519
Oh!

50:25.521 --> 50:28.389
So close.

50:28.391 --> 50:30.391
You have such great strength.

50:30.393 --> 50:33.461
You may actually take longer
to break than the others,

50:33.463 --> 50:35.795
but you will break.

50:35.797 --> 50:38.666
Everyone breaks.

50:38.668 --> 50:40.400
Fuck you.

50:40.402 --> 50:45.405
Do you know the very best way
to begin breaking a man

50:45.407 --> 50:47.842
is by taking away the very thing
that makes him one.

50:47.844 --> 50:51.081
Oh! Oh.

50:53.115 --> 50:57.784
Deuteronomy 23:1.

50:57.786 --> 51:01.822
"No man having been emasculated
or has his male organs cut off

51:01.824 --> 51:04.528
shall be allowed to enter
into the assembly of God."

51:22.811 --> 51:24.080
You're gonna have to wait...

51:30.219 --> 51:31.153
No!

51:35.925 --> 51:38.695
<i>They got
my little brother, man.</i>

51:40.163 --> 51:42.896
God, Bobby, no!
Come on, Bobby!

51:42.898 --> 51:44.433
Ah, shit.

51:47.235 --> 51:49.537
Bobby!

51:49.539 --> 51:50.774
Come on, Bobby!

52:05.554 --> 52:07.621
It's okay, kid.
It's me, it's me.

52:07.623 --> 52:10.523
- It's okay, kid. It's me.
- Help.

52:10.525 --> 52:11.691
We're out of here.
Let's go, come on.

52:11.693 --> 52:13.730
We're out of here. Let's go.

52:15.297 --> 52:16.832
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

52:31.947 --> 52:34.416
Go, go, go, go.

52:41.824 --> 52:43.527
What the fuck is this?

52:45.460 --> 52:46.663
Look.

52:51.601 --> 52:54.237
Come on, let's go.
Go, go, go, go.

53:03.746 --> 53:04.881
Really, Denny?

53:05.947 --> 53:07.581
Really, Denny?

53:07.583 --> 53:10.351
Get up. Get up!

53:10.353 --> 53:12.653
- They are loose.
- Huh?

53:12.655 --> 53:14.858
They... are...

53:16.559 --> 53:17.827
loose!

53:20.762 --> 53:22.662
This little hobby of yours

53:22.664 --> 53:25.634
is making you very,
very careless, Denny.

53:26.869 --> 53:28.869
Now pay close attention, okay?

53:28.871 --> 53:32.572
Pay fucking attention!

53:32.574 --> 53:34.874
I haven't taught you
everything I know about pain.

53:38.981 --> 53:41.581
Now take care of the problem.

53:43.385 --> 53:45.588
Take care of
the fucking problem!

53:54.530 --> 53:55.762
You...

53:55.764 --> 53:58.500
Get upstairs. Get upstairs!

53:59.668 --> 54:01.735
Come on, get going.

54:01.737 --> 54:04.708
Don't look back. Get going.
We gotta get out of this tunnel.

54:05.875 --> 54:07.409
Keep going.

54:15.483 --> 54:17.383
Go upstairs. Go upstairs!

54:17.385 --> 54:18.952
Find them up there.
You, come here, you.

54:18.954 --> 54:21.054
You get over here.
Now, you find them.

54:21.056 --> 54:23.057
And if you disfigure
one more body,

54:23.059 --> 54:25.394
you are gonna be the one
praying for death.

54:33.568 --> 54:36.336
They ain't gone.

54:36.338 --> 54:38.005
Where are they?

54:38.007 --> 54:39.740
Where are they?!

54:39.742 --> 54:40.974
Now you listen to me!

54:40.976 --> 54:43.110
I can go out there
anytime I want,

54:43.112 --> 54:45.646
and I can put a bullet
in your little pup's head.

54:45.648 --> 54:47.548
Don't you ever
forget that.

54:47.550 --> 54:49.686
Don't you ever forget that!

54:50.753 --> 54:51.688
Damn it.

54:55.990 --> 54:57.358
Keep moving,

54:57.360 --> 54:59.461
Come on, let's go.

55:16.112 --> 55:18.644
- Thank you.
- Okay, here's what's happening.

55:18.646 --> 55:20.447
You stick to the woods,
you do not go on the road,

55:20.449 --> 55:23.516
and you talk to no one,
you find your mom,

55:23.518 --> 55:26.086
and you get your asses
out of this twisted shithole.

55:26.088 --> 55:27.420
You understand me?

55:27.422 --> 55:29.088
Okay, let's go.

55:29.090 --> 55:30.624
Not us. You.

55:30.626 --> 55:32.626
What?

55:32.628 --> 55:36.697
Look, all these assholes gotta
do is call the state police.

55:36.699 --> 55:38.831
I just killed two people,

55:38.833 --> 55:41.467
including
my best friend's brother.

55:41.469 --> 55:43.670
Plus they're probably laying at
least six other murders on me

55:43.672 --> 55:45.572
as we speak.

55:45.574 --> 55:47.574
I gotta get the hell
out of here

55:47.576 --> 55:51.845
and be gone
for the rest of my life,

55:51.847 --> 55:54.815
not to mention the fact
that my old cellmate

55:54.817 --> 55:57.083
is gonna be one pissed-off
son of a bitch

55:57.085 --> 56:02.088
when he finds out his $3 million
is gone with me.

56:02.090 --> 56:03.726
Oh, fuck!

56:05.094 --> 56:08.195
This is about money?

56:08.197 --> 56:10.963
What email did you miss?

56:10.965 --> 56:14.133
I'm not a good guy, kid.

56:14.135 --> 56:16.702
The money's gone.
I'm fucked.

56:16.704 --> 56:19.572
I got no reason for being here.

56:19.574 --> 56:21.708
So have a nice...

56:21.710 --> 56:22.746
whatever.

56:24.612 --> 56:27.046
Please.

56:27.048 --> 56:32.755
Look, just find your mom
and get out of here.

56:34.722 --> 56:37.624
Okay?

56:37.626 --> 56:40.626
You can't just leave me here!

56:40.628 --> 56:42.699
Please!

58:04.179 --> 58:06.847
Mom?

58:06.849 --> 58:10.153
Mom, we have to get out of here.
Denny and Father John, Mom...

58:11.920 --> 58:14.253
I'm so sorry, baby.

58:14.255 --> 58:17.224
All you had to do
was mind your own business.

58:17.226 --> 58:19.025
About what?

58:19.027 --> 58:21.061
Mommy here
should've taught you.

58:21.063 --> 58:23.597
You never look a gift horse
in the mouth.

58:23.599 --> 58:26.066
Who the hell you think
pays for all this?

58:26.068 --> 58:27.668
What are you talking about?

58:27.670 --> 58:30.804
You little shit,
you know how this town works.

58:30.806 --> 58:32.338
Mom?

58:32.340 --> 58:33.673
Time to go.

58:33.675 --> 58:34.941
No.

58:34.943 --> 58:36.342
Mom. Mom!

58:36.344 --> 58:39.281
- Please! No!
- I'm sorry.

58:40.349 --> 58:42.983
Mom!

58:42.985 --> 58:44.988
I'm sorry.

58:47.356 --> 58:49.592
Feel all better
in no time at all.

59:00.268 --> 59:01.937
- Hey, boys.
- Jesus!

59:05.708 --> 59:07.844
Who the fuck are you?

59:12.715 --> 59:14.113
Who are you?

59:18.621 --> 59:20.052
The preacher and the cop.

59:20.054 --> 59:22.054
Real names, phone numbers,
friends and family.

59:23.992 --> 59:25.891
I don't know what
you're talking about, dude.

59:27.262 --> 59:28.862
I don't think you understand.

59:28.864 --> 59:30.630
I've got this whole thing
about revenge.

59:31.800 --> 59:32.999
Fuck you.

59:38.706 --> 59:41.842
These?
They don't heal real well.

59:43.378 --> 59:45.112
Anything coming back to you yet?

59:45.114 --> 59:48.414
Okay, okay. They're in charge
of the inventory.

59:48.416 --> 59:50.050
How long?

59:50.052 --> 59:51.684
Christ, I don't know.

59:51.686 --> 59:54.121
A decade, maybe more.

59:54.123 --> 59:56.923
Hey, look, I'll make you a deal.

59:56.925 --> 59:58.659
I'll cut you in, dude.

59:58.661 --> 01:00:01.193
Look, we're on the way
to a pickup right now.

01:00:01.195 --> 01:00:03.065
Check my phone.
It's in my pocket.

01:00:06.335 --> 01:00:08.834
Dude!

01:00:08.836 --> 01:00:10.871
What am I looking for?

01:00:10.873 --> 01:00:12.938
Look for one
from earlier today.

01:00:12.940 --> 01:00:15.175
From Abraham Issacs.

01:00:15.177 --> 01:00:19.179
That's your buddy John's
business pseudonym.

01:00:19.181 --> 01:00:20.249
Yeah.

01:00:21.983 --> 01:00:25.117
- Aw, Sherry.
- Yeah.

01:00:25.119 --> 01:00:27.920
She could be worth a lot
of money to a guy like you.

01:00:27.922 --> 01:00:32.325
Hey, your cut
of four million. Yeah!

01:00:32.327 --> 01:00:34.360
- Four million?
- Yeah.

01:00:35.396 --> 01:00:37.063
Yeah.

01:00:37.065 --> 01:00:38.365
- Four million?
- Yeah. Four...

01:01:04.827 --> 01:01:06.763
Damn it.

01:01:24.780 --> 01:01:28.248
Please. Please, no.

01:01:28.250 --> 01:01:29.686
No.

01:01:31.452 --> 01:01:34.387
Sherry, Sherry, Sherry!

01:01:34.389 --> 01:01:36.822
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:01:36.824 --> 01:01:39.291
Sherry.

01:01:39.293 --> 01:01:41.961
My child.

01:01:41.963 --> 01:01:47.934
You are about to embark down
a road of such great purpose

01:01:47.936 --> 01:01:49.936
that even if you
were to be granted

01:01:49.938 --> 01:01:53.273
several more years of life...

01:01:53.275 --> 01:01:56.208
ten, fifteen, twenty...

01:01:56.210 --> 01:01:58.244
there is no way in hell that
you could possibly accomplish

01:01:58.246 --> 01:02:01.313
what you are going to accomplish
in this one single day,

01:02:01.315 --> 01:02:02.916
in this room.

01:02:02.918 --> 01:02:05.153
Fuck you.

01:02:08.090 --> 01:02:10.990
You know, that is exactly
what I thought you would say.

01:02:10.992 --> 01:02:14.396
I was prepared for it.
I can read you like a book.

01:02:41.190 --> 01:02:45.559
You know, I happened
to stumble upon

01:02:45.561 --> 01:02:48.128
a rather interesting anesthetic

01:02:48.130 --> 01:02:49.528
I think you may find
fascinating.

01:02:49.530 --> 01:02:53.499
Would you like to know about it?
Sure you would.

01:02:53.501 --> 01:02:57.470
Succinylcholine.

01:02:57.472 --> 01:03:01.441
Now, I could go into
a rather long,

01:03:01.443 --> 01:03:03.844
potentially boring
technical description

01:03:03.846 --> 01:03:05.345
of exactly what it does,

01:03:05.347 --> 01:03:08.949
but suffice it to say,
what it does best

01:03:08.951 --> 01:03:12.221
is it induces paralysis.

01:03:17.159 --> 01:03:19.959
Paralysis means you can't move.

01:03:19.961 --> 01:03:22.061
Not a muscle.

01:03:22.063 --> 01:03:24.597
But sadly,
what it does not do

01:03:24.599 --> 01:03:29.436
is it does not block
any of the pain responders,

01:03:29.438 --> 01:03:34.177
nor does it render the patient
unconscious.

01:03:37.445 --> 01:03:41.548
Makes it so the patient, you,

01:03:41.550 --> 01:03:44.083
is wide awake,

01:03:44.085 --> 01:03:46.119
fully aware,

01:03:46.121 --> 01:03:51.224
able to enjoy
each and every moment

01:03:51.226 --> 01:03:53.392
of each and every procedure,

01:03:53.394 --> 01:03:56.833
or, as in your case...

01:04:01.202 --> 01:04:03.572
procedures.

01:04:13.215 --> 01:04:14.914
You know, Sherry,

01:04:14.916 --> 01:04:18.985
you have been to me
one glorious pain in my ass.

01:04:18.987 --> 01:04:22.291
And those beautiful eyes
have seen way too much.

01:04:24.226 --> 01:04:27.459
So I think it's only fair

01:04:27.461 --> 01:04:30.266
that we start
with those beautiful eyes.

01:04:42.110 --> 01:04:44.711
Timothy 15:13.

01:04:44.713 --> 01:04:50.483
"There is no greater love
than any man or woman

01:04:50.485 --> 01:04:55.291
who is willing to give her life
for her friends..."

01:04:58.994 --> 01:05:01.364
I really hate assholes
that quote the Bible.

01:05:03.331 --> 01:05:05.400
Come on, kid,
let's get out of here.

01:05:11.039 --> 01:05:13.273
Tony, it's your father.
We got trouble at the house.

01:05:13.275 --> 01:05:15.441
I want you to get on the phone,
and you get everyone over here.

01:05:15.443 --> 01:05:16.642
Do you hear me?

01:05:16.644 --> 01:05:17.978
<i>Okay, I'll bring Greg.</i>

01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:19.315
You get everyone!

01:05:20.382 --> 01:05:22.048
What about Denny?

01:05:22.050 --> 01:05:24.249
Don't worry about Denny.
I'll take care of Denny.

01:05:24.251 --> 01:05:26.286
You just get to the tunnel.
Come on, get out of here.

01:05:26.288 --> 01:05:27.690
Go, get out of here.

01:06:33.422 --> 01:06:34.590
Shit.

01:07:37.552 --> 01:07:39.284
Denny!

01:07:40.422 --> 01:07:42.488
Oh, jeez.

01:07:42.490 --> 01:07:44.257
Denny!

01:07:44.259 --> 01:07:46.358
Where are you?

01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:48.293
I know you're here,
little bitch.

01:07:48.295 --> 01:07:50.265
I know you're here.

01:08:05.579 --> 01:08:08.414
Here, piggy, piggy,
piggy, piggy!

01:08:08.416 --> 01:08:10.419
Here, piggy, piggy, piggy!

01:08:13.588 --> 01:08:14.820
Anybody home?

01:08:16.490 --> 01:08:18.625
You locked the door.

01:08:18.627 --> 01:08:20.460
That's too bad.

01:08:20.462 --> 01:08:22.562
I'm just gonna have to go home.

01:08:22.564 --> 01:08:24.731
Or maybe I'll knock a little
harder, you little bitch!

01:08:36.877 --> 01:08:39.812
I know you're around here
somewhere!

01:08:39.814 --> 01:08:42.182
<i>Okay, Dad, we're all here
and no one's getting out.</i>

01:08:42.184 --> 01:08:43.649
You hear that?
You know who that is.

01:08:43.652 --> 01:08:47.352
That's my boy Tony
and Greg Hoffer

01:08:47.354 --> 01:08:51.790
and probably your mama sealing
this house up good and tight.

01:08:51.792 --> 01:08:55.627
Now you gotta ask yourself
a question:

01:08:55.630 --> 01:08:57.897
If you get by me,

01:08:57.899 --> 01:09:00.435
how are you ever
gonna get by them?

01:09:11.479 --> 01:09:13.413
Goddamn it.

01:09:15.515 --> 01:09:18.252
Ugh!

01:09:47.481 --> 01:09:49.682
- Denny!
- What'd I tell you?

01:09:49.684 --> 01:09:51.017
You weren't going nowhere.

01:09:51.019 --> 01:09:52.585
John, you all right?

01:09:52.587 --> 01:09:54.586
I'm having trouble breathing.

01:09:54.588 --> 01:09:56.289
I think one of my...

01:09:56.291 --> 01:09:58.324
I think I might have
punctured a lung.

01:09:58.326 --> 01:10:01.027
Give me the knife.
You don't wanna hurt yourself.

01:10:01.029 --> 01:10:03.963
Oh, boy, oh, boy,
this is bad, I tell you.

01:10:03.965 --> 01:10:07.567
I'm thinking we maybe need to
dissolve our relationship.

01:10:07.569 --> 01:10:10.937
I mean, you gotta think,
who could that man have told?

01:10:10.939 --> 01:10:12.671
Who could she have told?

01:10:12.673 --> 01:10:15.575
I think we just gotta
cut our relationship.

01:10:15.577 --> 01:10:18.544
We gotta pack up and move
somewhere else, but don't worry.

01:10:18.546 --> 01:10:21.613
We have the resources.

01:10:21.615 --> 01:10:23.452
What?

01:10:25.487 --> 01:10:27.690
Not we, John.

01:10:29.757 --> 01:10:31.958
You feel that?

01:10:36.631 --> 01:10:38.634
70/30, my ass.

01:10:43.070 --> 01:10:44.637
Where do you think
you're going?

01:10:49.043 --> 01:10:50.843
- Let her go!
- Hey, hey!

01:10:50.845 --> 01:10:52.577
Don't you fucking move!

01:10:52.579 --> 01:10:54.479
I'll twist her pretty little
fucking head off!

01:10:54.481 --> 01:10:56.616
Stop!

01:10:56.618 --> 01:10:58.050
Stop.

01:10:58.052 --> 01:10:59.686
Don't you fucking move.

01:10:59.688 --> 01:11:01.724
Tony. Tony, it's your father.

01:11:03.390 --> 01:11:06.092
- Yeah, Dad, go ahead.
- <i>Change of plans.</i>

01:11:06.094 --> 01:11:10.028
You come in here, and you tear
this motherfucker to pieces.

01:11:10.030 --> 01:11:12.732
My pleasure.

01:11:12.734 --> 01:11:16.602
Everyone, stay back
and make sure no one gets out.

01:11:16.604 --> 01:11:18.641
Billy, you're coming with me.

01:11:24.045 --> 01:11:25.346
Get in there.

01:11:30.618 --> 01:11:31.887
Fucking kill him!

01:11:36.423 --> 01:11:37.693
Keep going!

01:12:08.523 --> 01:12:09.992
Get down.

01:12:14.496 --> 01:12:16.629
Precious.

01:12:16.631 --> 01:12:18.600
Precious.

01:12:23.003 --> 01:12:24.870
You had to do things
your own way.

01:12:24.872 --> 01:12:27.973
Couldn't keep your mouth shut,
could you? Could you?

01:12:27.975 --> 01:12:31.544
Well, it's time to change
our business model, that's all.

01:12:31.546 --> 01:12:34.112
Just gotta change the way
we do business, right?

01:12:34.114 --> 01:12:36.682
This way's done.
Come on, let's go.

01:12:36.684 --> 01:12:39.454
Get up.
Get up! Go! Go!

01:12:52.167 --> 01:12:53.969
God, that hurts!

01:13:36.944 --> 01:13:40.615
Oh, my God.
What have I done?

01:13:42.917 --> 01:13:45.585
Sherry dropped this
in her car.

01:13:45.587 --> 01:13:47.219
I already dialed it.

01:13:47.221 --> 01:13:49.425
All you have to do
is press send.

01:13:51.859 --> 01:13:55.163
Yes, I need to be
put through to the state police.

01:15:20.782 --> 01:15:21.850
Come with me.

01:15:42.103 --> 01:15:44.273
Don't you fuckin' move.

01:16:07.729 --> 01:16:08.727
Hey!

01:16:11.265 --> 01:16:12.964
Fuck you.

01:16:32.886 --> 01:16:34.285
<i>Pure horror
this morning</i>

01:16:34.287 --> 01:16:37.055
<i>in the tiny southern community
of Chesterton.</i>

01:16:37.057 --> 01:16:39.424
<i>State police discovered
the bodies of four people</i>

01:16:39.426 --> 01:16:41.893
<i>and partial remains
of countless more</i>

01:16:41.895 --> 01:16:43.963
<i>in what law enforcement
officials are calling</i>

01:16:43.965 --> 01:16:46.365
<i>one of the most gruesome
organ-harvesting operations...</i>

01:17:25.105 --> 01:17:27.440
So I'm guessing
that's it, huh?

01:17:27.442 --> 01:17:29.344
Yep.

01:17:32.046 --> 01:17:35.981
I think I'll be okay.
I'll probably just...

01:17:35.983 --> 01:17:39.151
Hey, it's better I don't know.

01:17:39.153 --> 01:17:41.690
So where you gonna go?

01:17:45.359 --> 01:17:47.295
It's better if I don't know.

01:17:53.967 --> 01:17:55.369
Here. Take it.

01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:02.208
How much is this?

01:18:02.210 --> 01:18:05.111
I don't know. A lot.

01:18:05.113 --> 01:18:07.146
I can't.

01:18:07.148 --> 01:18:08.250
You earned it.

01:18:09.350 --> 01:18:11.784
Spend it wisely.

01:18:11.786 --> 01:18:14.355
Use it to get as far away
from here as you can.

01:18:17.257 --> 01:18:19.090
Thank you.

01:18:19.092 --> 01:18:20.895
You're welcome.

01:18:24.798 --> 01:18:26.835
Now get out of here, kid.

01:18:29.436 --> 01:18:31.238
You getting choked up?

01:18:34.408 --> 01:18:37.276
I said get the hell
out of here, kid.

01:18:37.278 --> 01:18:41.048
I'll see you again,
Crimson Matthews.

01:18:42.216 --> 01:18:44.086
Don't count on it.

01:19:54.921 --> 01:19:57.057
Inmate Shooter, you got mail.

01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:02.861
This wouldn't be any
weapon of mass destruction

01:20:02.863 --> 01:20:05.630
or contraband being introduced
to my penitentiary

01:20:05.632 --> 01:20:06.932
now, would it?

01:20:06.934 --> 01:20:09.934
Sure hope not.

01:20:09.936 --> 01:20:12.470
I'd hate to see you lose
your good standing

01:20:12.472 --> 01:20:16.976
with the national honor society
of convicted felons and inmates.

01:20:16.978 --> 01:20:18.212
Enjoy your literature.
