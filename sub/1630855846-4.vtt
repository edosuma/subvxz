00:10.135 --> 00:10.343
.

00:10.385 --> 00:11.553
- People are irrational,
but predictably so.

00:13.179 --> 00:16.349
I'm Alec Mercer.
Welcome to Applied Psychology.

00:16.391 --> 00:17.767
- You're the science guy.
- That's Bill Nye.

00:17.809 --> 00:19.728
I'm actually
the behavioral science guy.

00:19.769 --> 00:21.771
It's called
an auditory illusion.

00:21.813 --> 00:25.025
Our eyes and ears
take in electrical signals,

00:25.066 --> 00:30.363
which our brains interpret
based on our expectations.

00:30.405 --> 00:34.200
This work can be surprising,
stimulating,

00:34.242 --> 00:38.121
profoundly fulfilling,
but there's a cost.

00:39.372 --> 00:42.459
[notifications chiming]

00:44.294 --> 00:47.005
- You gonna answer these?
A couple say "urgent."

00:47.047 --> 00:48.715
- Well, any of
them say I'm fired?

00:48.757 --> 00:50.300
If not, they can wait.

00:50.342 --> 00:53.970
- No, but apparently you have
a meeting starting right now.

00:54.012 --> 00:55.013
That part's in all caps.

00:55.055 --> 00:57.057
- Mm.
Time is a construct.

00:57.098 --> 00:58.266
I'm frying bigger fish.

00:58.308 --> 01:00.560
- I've noticed a lot
of emergency texts

01:00.602 --> 01:01.561
and calls lately.

01:01.603 --> 01:03.021
What's up?

01:03.063 --> 01:07.108
- Maybe 1% of IT emergencies
are real security threats.

01:07.150 --> 01:09.277
the other 99
are almost always PEBKAC.

01:09.319 --> 01:10.904
- PEB-what?
[notification chimes]

01:10.945 --> 01:15.408
- PEBKAC, as in "Problems Exist
Between Keyboard And Chair."

01:15.450 --> 01:17.869
[Alec groans]
User error.

01:17.911 --> 01:20.121
I swear, they ought
to make you get a license

01:20.163 --> 01:21.581
to operate a computer.

01:21.623 --> 01:25.794
Besides, suckers live to work
and I work to live.

01:25.835 --> 01:27.087
- Working and enjoying life

01:27.128 --> 01:28.505
don't have to be
mutually exclusive.

01:28.546 --> 01:32.092
- Mm-mm. Do not therapize me
this early in the day.

01:32.133 --> 01:33.343
I haven't even
had my coffee yet.

01:33.385 --> 01:35.887
[notifications chiming]

01:37.263 --> 01:38.932
- All yours.

01:38.973 --> 01:40.266
I have a book signing today.

01:40.308 --> 01:42.018
- A bunch of folks
waiting in line

01:42.060 --> 01:45.480
just so some nerdy scientist
can write his name in a book.

01:45.522 --> 01:49.109
Nothing irrational about that.

01:49.150 --> 01:52.278
[soft upbeat music]

01:52.320 --> 01:54.114
[shopkeeper's bell rings]

01:54.155 --> 01:55.115
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

01:55.156 --> 01:57.492
- Uh, excuse me.

01:57.534 --> 01:59.911
Uh, Professor Mercer,
I'm sorry.

01:59.953 --> 02:00.912
I need to talk to you.

02:00.954 --> 02:02.747
- My man, there's a line.

02:02.789 --> 02:05.166
If you want a book signed, you
can support local businesses

02:05.208 --> 02:06.418
and buy one
at the shop next door.

02:06.459 --> 02:07.794
- I'm not here
for an autograph.

02:07.836 --> 02:11.089
My daughter is missing.
I need your help.

02:11.131 --> 02:13.717
[tense music]

02:18.680 --> 02:21.558
- This is Veronica.
- Ah.

02:21.599 --> 02:22.976
- She left yesterday
after dinner,

02:23.018 --> 02:25.687
but she wasn't home
when we woke up this morning.

02:25.729 --> 02:27.647
- She didn't tell you
where she was going?

02:27.689 --> 02:29.274
- She said she
was meeting a friend.

02:29.315 --> 02:31.568
She got a ride with someone.

02:31.609 --> 02:34.821
The police don't care because
it hasn't been 24 hours.

02:34.863 --> 02:36.531
And yeah, she's over 18--

02:36.573 --> 02:39.993
- Are you sure
she didn't run away?

02:40.035 --> 02:43.872
- Look at her.
She's not that kind of kid.

02:43.913 --> 02:45.331
She's an artist.

02:45.373 --> 02:48.209
Look, I think something
is wrong and I need your help,

02:48.251 --> 02:50.170
like you helped
with that journalist

02:50.211 --> 02:52.422
who was poisoned,
or that hostage thing.

02:52.464 --> 02:54.883
- You know my work enough
to use my tricks against me,

02:54.924 --> 02:57.802
like showing me
pictures of Veronica

02:57.844 --> 02:59.179
to invest me emotionally.

02:59.220 --> 03:01.181
- The
Identifiable Victim Effect.

03:01.222 --> 03:02.766
- Okay.

03:02.807 --> 03:05.852
- I listen to your books
while I work construction.

03:05.894 --> 03:09.272
I know that you help police.
I know that your wife is FBI.

03:09.314 --> 03:12.692
- Ex-wife--there's a chapter
about divorce in my new book.

03:12.734 --> 03:15.695
- My-my point is I know how
brilliant you are, brother.

03:15.737 --> 03:18.448
your insights
into how people think,

03:18.490 --> 03:20.367
how you get them
to make better decisions,

03:20.408 --> 03:22.869
you're my best hope
for finding my daughter.

03:22.911 --> 03:26.039
- Now you're using
the complimentary glow effect,

03:26.081 --> 03:27.165
otherwise known as,

03:27.207 --> 03:30.126
"flattery
will get you everywhere."

03:30.168 --> 03:31.836
- I can pay.

03:31.878 --> 03:33.672
Now, my wife and I, we can't
afford your usual rate,

03:33.713 --> 03:35.048
but we have a few
thousand dollars saved.

03:35.090 --> 03:36.424
- Hear me.

03:36.466 --> 03:39.928
The amazing thing about
the complimentary glow

03:39.969 --> 03:45.850
is that it works even if the
subject knows you're using it.

03:46.184 --> 03:47.310
[Alec inhales deeply]

03:47.352 --> 03:50.355
I'll help you, man.

03:50.397 --> 03:52.232
Free of charge.

03:52.273 --> 03:54.609
[person inhales shakily]

03:54.651 --> 03:57.779
[suspenseful music]

03:57.821 --> 04:03.201
* *

04:03.243 --> 04:05.578
- That was the last time
we saw her.

04:05.620 --> 04:07.247
- Do you recognize the car?

04:07.288 --> 04:09.332
- No.
We've never seen it before.

04:09.374 --> 04:12.210
- Can you rewind?

04:12.252 --> 04:15.588
* *

04:15.630 --> 04:17.882
Look how she's shifting
her head from side to side,

04:17.924 --> 04:20.593
like she's
worried someone might see her.

04:20.635 --> 04:22.721
She's holding her purse
like a shield.

04:22.762 --> 04:25.056
And that micro-hesitation
at the car door--

04:25.098 --> 04:27.142
it's as if she's not sure
she wants to get in.

04:27.183 --> 04:30.186
- This, too. Her sketchbook.
She takes it everywhere.

04:30.228 --> 04:33.106
- Hmm.

04:33.148 --> 04:40.030
* *

04:44.200 --> 04:46.703
[phone rings]

04:46.745 --> 04:49.039
- [gasps]
Veronica, where are you?

04:49.080 --> 04:50.248
- [distorted voice]
I have your daughter.

04:50.290 --> 04:51.458
If you want
to get her back,

04:51.499 --> 04:53.293
you need to do exactly
what I say.

04:53.335 --> 04:55.170
- Please, please,
don't hurt her.

04:55.211 --> 04:56.463
- We need proof of life.
Put Veronica on the phone.

04:56.504 --> 04:58.798
- Who is that?
No police!

04:58.840 --> 05:01.301
- No, he's a friend,
not police.

05:01.343 --> 05:03.011
Can we please
just hear Veronica?

05:03.053 --> 05:06.765
- Mommy! Daddy!
Please, do what he says!

05:06.806 --> 05:08.558
- Enough!
Quiet!

05:08.600 --> 05:12.103
If you want your daughter back
alive, I want $2.7 million.

05:12.145 --> 05:14.981
I'll contact you with details.
You have 48 hours.

05:15.023 --> 05:15.940
[line disconnects]

05:15.982 --> 05:18.485
- $2.7 million?

05:18.526 --> 05:20.153
We don't have
that kind of money.

05:20.195 --> 05:21.863
- Do you have anything
that's worth that much?

05:21.905 --> 05:25.784
- No. This place is rented.
Keith makes all the furniture.

05:25.825 --> 05:27.327
- If my stuff was
worth anything,

05:27.369 --> 05:29.496
I wouldn't be framing houses.

05:29.537 --> 05:31.122
So what's going
to happen to Veronica?

05:31.164 --> 05:33.875
Because we--we can't pay.

05:33.917 --> 05:35.168
* *

05:35.210 --> 05:36.544
- Why kidnap someone

05:36.586 --> 05:38.922
whose family couldn't possibly
afford the ransom?

05:38.963 --> 05:41.049
[ominous music]

05:49.599 --> 05:49.808
.

05:49.849 --> 05:50.642
- I've been digging into
the van,

05:51.810 --> 05:52.894
the dry cleaning van
that Alec remembered,

05:52.936 --> 05:54.229
contacted
the owner's daughter.

05:54.270 --> 05:57.649
- Sioux City, right?
I always wanted to see Iowa.

05:57.691 --> 05:58.942
- Liar.

05:58.983 --> 06:00.318
But you're off the hook.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.444
It turns out that
she's bringing

06:01.486 --> 06:02.696
her kids to DC in a few weeks,

06:02.737 --> 06:04.614
so I tried to set a meet.
- All right.

06:04.656 --> 06:05.907
I'll take care of
the arrest report

06:05.949 --> 06:07.033
so you can focus on this.

06:07.075 --> 06:09.285
[notification chimes]

06:09.327 --> 06:10.578
- It's Alec.

06:10.620 --> 06:13.081
He wants to talk.
Says it's urgent.

06:13.123 --> 06:15.750
[soft upbeat music]

06:15.792 --> 06:18.628
- So you all have
your next kits.

06:18.670 --> 06:20.880
Remember, this time you
get $5 for completing it.

06:20.922 --> 06:27.846
* *

06:27.887 --> 06:30.098
[Rizwan grunting]

06:30.140 --> 06:32.017
- Sorry, that's all the
time we have for today.

06:32.058 --> 06:34.394
You can all go.

06:34.436 --> 06:36.062
- Wow.
- What are you doing?

06:36.104 --> 06:37.939
I was at the smashing.
That's the best part.

06:37.981 --> 06:40.400
- Yeah, well,
our day has been smashed.

06:40.442 --> 06:41.901
The professor texted.

06:41.943 --> 06:43.278
He's had an emergency,
and he won't be back.

06:43.319 --> 06:45.321
- So you're going to teach
Psych 30 this afternoon

06:45.363 --> 06:46.573
or--
- Nope. You are.

06:46.614 --> 06:47.907
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:47.949 --> 06:49.409
I don't want
to step on your toes.

06:49.451 --> 06:51.411
I--[gulps]
You should totally do it.

06:51.453 --> 06:52.996
- Professor's orders.

06:53.038 --> 06:54.539
The boss has me
pulling research on kidnappers,

06:54.581 --> 06:56.708
so you're it.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.668
He said to lecture
on the complimentary glow

06:58.710 --> 06:59.878
and its opposite,
the humiliation shadow.

06:59.919 --> 07:01.546
- I've only ever
taught TA sessions

07:01.588 --> 07:03.048
for eight or ten people.

07:03.089 --> 07:05.383
Psych 30 has 200 students.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.218
- I guess it's time
to level up.

07:07.260 --> 07:10.180
[suspenseful music]

07:10.221 --> 07:11.473

[Rizwan sighs]

07:12.640 --> 07:17.520
* *

07:17.562 --> 07:18.855
- Thank you for coming.

07:18.897 --> 07:20.690
- You had me at
"kidnapping for ransom."

07:20.732 --> 07:24.361
Keith, Tara,
I'm Agent Clark, FBI.

07:24.402 --> 07:25.862
First thing you should know

07:25.904 --> 07:28.531
is that kidnappings
are an FBI specialty.

07:28.573 --> 07:30.700
We will
get Veronica back safely.

07:30.742 --> 07:31.868
- She's very good
at what she does.

07:31.910 --> 07:33.703
- I have already had my techs

07:33.745 --> 07:36.831
try to locate Veronica's cell,
but its signal is blocked.

07:36.873 --> 07:39.000
I'll need one of you
to come back to my office

07:39.042 --> 07:40.335
so we can tap your cell.

07:40.377 --> 07:41.419
He called you, right?

07:41.461 --> 07:42.587
- He did.

07:42.629 --> 07:44.964
[cars approaching]
- More agents?

07:45.006 --> 07:47.884
* *

07:47.926 --> 07:49.511
- Not mine.

07:49.552 --> 07:52.972
Stay inside.
[car doors shutting]

07:53.014 --> 07:56.893
* *

07:56.935 --> 07:57.811
[door opens]

07:57.852 --> 08:00.522
Agent Clark, FBI.
You are?

08:00.563 --> 08:02.899
- Theodore Akehurst Jr.
Call me Ted.

08:02.941 --> 08:04.818
This is my son, Theodore III.

08:04.859 --> 08:05.819
- Trey.

08:05.860 --> 08:08.071
- Akehurst?
Like Akehurst Paper?

08:08.113 --> 08:09.948
We have reams of your paper
in my office.

08:09.989 --> 08:11.741
Toilet paper, too.
- You called him?

08:11.783 --> 08:13.201
How could you call him?
- I had to.

08:13.243 --> 08:14.619
He can help.

08:14.661 --> 08:16.579
* *

08:16.621 --> 08:18.707
- Tara used to work for me.

08:18.748 --> 08:20.375
She told me that Veronica
had been kidnapped,

08:20.417 --> 08:21.626
and we came as quickly
as we could.

08:21.668 --> 08:23.086
This is Rose Dinshaw from VSC.

08:23.128 --> 08:24.671
She's an expert
on corporate security

08:24.713 --> 08:26.297
and crisis management.

08:26.339 --> 08:27.757
- Corporate fixer.

08:27.799 --> 08:29.926
- With experience
in kidnap and ransom.

08:29.968 --> 08:31.720
The Akehursts will do
whatever it takes

08:31.761 --> 08:34.097
to help get Veronica home
safely.

08:34.139 --> 08:35.598
- That's good to hear.

08:35.640 --> 08:39.436
But I have to ask, why?

08:39.477 --> 08:42.397
- Like Ted said,
I used to work for him.

08:42.439 --> 08:43.940
We're friends.
[Keith scoffs]

08:43.982 --> 08:47.110
- Given your guilty fidgeting,
Keith's hostility,

08:47.152 --> 08:49.112
and Ted's inability
to look away from you,

08:49.154 --> 08:51.531
I'm pretty sure you
and Ted had an affair?

08:51.573 --> 08:54.117
Long term?

08:54.159 --> 08:55.660
You ended it.

08:55.702 --> 08:57.120
You and Keith stayed together,

08:57.162 --> 09:00.665
but it's still a source
of tension in your marriage.

09:00.707 --> 09:03.043
- I guess having my family's
deepest secret called out

09:03.084 --> 09:05.503
is what I get
for asking for help

09:05.545 --> 09:07.589
from an expert
on human mistakes.

09:07.630 --> 09:09.174
- You and Mrs. Moore?

09:09.215 --> 09:11.259
That's super messed up,
even for you.

09:11.301 --> 09:14.054
- Don't talk about things
you don't understand.

09:14.095 --> 09:15.680
- I don't see how
this is relevant.

09:15.722 --> 09:16.931
- I normally wouldn't
have raised it,

09:16.973 --> 09:18.475
but given the circumstances--

09:18.516 --> 09:22.270
I need to ask, are you
Veronica's biological father?

09:22.312 --> 09:25.148
- That would explain
why she was targeted.

09:25.190 --> 09:27.400
- She's mine.

09:27.442 --> 09:29.652
Believe me, I checked.

09:29.694 --> 09:32.155
- The affair happened
after Veronica was born.

09:32.197 --> 09:33.907
- Look, Mrs. Moore
has worked at our house

09:33.948 --> 09:35.325
for as long as I can remember.

09:35.367 --> 09:37.827
Veronica and I
practically grew up together.

09:37.869 --> 09:40.663
She may not be my sister,
but she's still family.

09:40.705 --> 09:42.374
- Pseudo-family bond.
- Mm.

09:42.415 --> 09:45.293
- Mr. Moore, it sounds like
my dad really hurt you,

09:45.335 --> 09:47.337
but let us help.

09:47.379 --> 09:48.588
* *

09:48.630 --> 09:50.173
[Keith scoffs]

09:50.215 --> 09:53.343
* *

09:53.385 --> 09:54.761
[birds singing]

09:54.803 --> 09:55.929
- Mr. Moore,
in my professional opinion,

09:55.970 --> 09:57.847
you should
minimize FBI involvement.

09:57.889 --> 09:59.599
Let my firm handle it.

09:59.641 --> 10:02.477
- Akehurst Paper has used VSC
for this kind of thing before.

10:02.519 --> 10:04.270
- Sure, overseas,

10:04.312 --> 10:08.733
retrieving executives
from professional kidnappers.

10:08.775 --> 10:12.278
Those skills won't
necessarily translate here.

10:12.320 --> 10:16.616
A lower-middle class victim,
an unreasonable ransom--

10:16.658 --> 10:18.451
those sound like
business as usual to you?

10:18.493 --> 10:20.036
- I'm sorry.

10:20.078 --> 10:23.123
I don't think the ransom demand
is unreasonable anymore.

10:23.164 --> 10:26.251
$2.7 million
is perfectly rational

10:26.292 --> 10:30.797
if the kidnapper knows about
Ted's concern for Veronica

10:30.839 --> 10:34.509
and knows that
his guilt from the affair

10:34.551 --> 10:37.595
would draw him into this.

10:37.637 --> 10:40.724
So who knew about the affair?

10:40.765 --> 10:43.560
[suspenseful music]

10:43.601 --> 10:44.769
- I never told a soul.

10:44.811 --> 10:46.062
- He's not lying.

10:46.104 --> 10:48.064
He sure as hell
never told me about it.

10:48.106 --> 10:51.568
- Veronica knew.

10:51.609 --> 10:56.448
She heard Tara and me arguing
about it, um, more than once.

10:56.489 --> 10:57.741
* *

10:57.782 --> 10:59.451
- You think
she'd tell her friends?

10:59.492 --> 11:02.704
- She definitely
told Corey Gibson.

11:02.746 --> 11:04.080
- Who is that?

11:04.122 --> 11:05.874
- Veronica's ex-boyfriend.

11:05.915 --> 11:09.919
They dated in high school,
broke up after graduation.

11:09.961 --> 11:12.130
But later, Veronica told me
that she dumped him

11:12.172 --> 11:14.299
because he was dealing
party drugs.

11:14.341 --> 11:15.925
Weed, mushrooms, molly.

11:15.967 --> 11:18.136
- Do you have any way
to contact this "Corey"?

11:18.178 --> 11:21.014
- His number would be
on Veronica's phone.

11:21.056 --> 11:22.599
And she took that with her.

11:22.640 --> 11:23.933
- I can check in
with the DEA,

11:23.975 --> 11:25.560
see if they have Corey
on their radar.

11:25.602 --> 11:28.730
- I have contacts there, too,
and with DC Metro Narcotics.

11:28.772 --> 11:30.774
- I've got him.

11:30.815 --> 11:33.860
My colleagues
are testing molly, MDMA,

11:33.902 --> 11:36.112
as a psychotherapeutic.

11:36.154 --> 11:39.491
MDMA isn't always available
through official channels,

11:39.532 --> 11:45.497
so sometimes my colleagues
get it other ways.

11:45.538 --> 11:49.167
So Agent Clark,
studies show that

11:49.209 --> 11:53.004
people trust couples
more than men on their own.

11:53.046 --> 11:54.798
How would you like
to do a drug deal?

11:54.839 --> 11:57.133
- You know I have
to get a sign off for that.

11:57.175 --> 12:00.220
- I don't.

12:02.847 --> 12:03.932
[indistinct chatter]

12:05.350 --> 12:08.520
Or handsome, whichever
you'd, uh, rather hear?

12:08.561 --> 12:10.897
Beautiful and handsome.

12:10.939 --> 12:13.483
But
not in an inappropriate way.

12:13.525 --> 12:14.818
Smart, too.

12:14.859 --> 12:17.696
You're at Wilton,
so you're probably very smart,

12:17.737 --> 12:21.324
um, and funny, and, um--

12:21.366 --> 12:22.784
yeah, never mind.

about the--[clears throat]--

12:34.004 --> 12:37.132
Let's--let's, uh, start again.

12:37.173 --> 12:40.593
You're all ugly,
and I hate you.

12:40.635 --> 12:43.638
It's just an example, guys.

12:43.680 --> 12:47.517
That's like the opp--
opposite of what I was doing.

12:47.559 --> 12:50.562
* *

12:50.603 --> 12:52.230
[crow cawing]

12:53.273 --> 12:54.607
- He's late.

12:54.649 --> 12:56.901
- Drug dealers aren't known
for their punctuality.

12:56.943 --> 12:59.529
- Maybe he didn't
buy our story.

12:59.571 --> 13:03.867
Rich out-of-towners looking
to score in bulk for a party?

13:05.702 --> 13:06.911
- Still nothing.

13:06.953 --> 13:09.456
- You sound annoyed.

13:09.497 --> 13:10.915
- I don't like nature.

13:10.957 --> 13:13.251
You know that.
There are bugs.

13:13.293 --> 13:14.502
- Liar.

13:14.544 --> 13:15.962
- Okay.

13:16.004 --> 13:20.383
How about I am not a fan
of corporate fixers like Rose?

13:20.425 --> 13:23.386
They're almost always
former Bureau or police

13:23.428 --> 13:26.389
who couldn't hack it
or decided to cash out.

13:26.431 --> 13:27.474
Or both.

13:27.515 --> 13:30.268
- Rose definitely
isn't FBI or police.

13:30.310 --> 13:34.564
I'm guessing someplace
starting with the letter M.

13:34.606 --> 13:36.691
- MI5?

13:36.733 --> 13:38.902
MI6?

13:38.943 --> 13:40.737
You think she used to be a spy?

13:40.779 --> 13:42.739
- I can't confirm that.

13:42.781 --> 13:44.991
Or deny it.

13:48.953 --> 13:50.914
- You're rather impressive,

13:50.955 --> 13:52.957
the way you sniffed out
the affair,

13:52.999 --> 13:55.126
how you helped get to Corey
as a suspect.

13:55.168 --> 13:58.254
- Like how
I know what you're doing?

13:58.296 --> 14:02.092
You and Agent Clark
are in conflict over this case.

14:02.133 --> 14:05.220
You want me to be your ally,
so you're buttering me up.

14:05.261 --> 14:06.971
- Or I'm just flirting
with you.

that picked up Veronica.

14:14.229 --> 14:15.522
- We're supposed
to be a couple.

14:15.563 --> 14:16.981
I'm making it look good.

15:56.122 --> 15:58.041
- Corey was
in fight-or-flight mode.

15:58.083 --> 15:59.793
And people in amped-up,
hot states

15:59.834 --> 16:01.961
tend to react by reflex,
which means,

16:02.003 --> 16:04.798
in high-speed car chases,
Americans tend to turn right.

16:14.349 --> 16:17.185
- They're not worth reading.
[scoffs]

16:17.227 --> 16:19.229
Studies show that online
reviews are self-selected

16:19.270 --> 16:21.981
to be either highly positive
or highly negative,

16:22.023 --> 16:25.193
with limited correlation
between ratings and quality.

say I was terrible

Oh, that's just mean.

16:40.959 --> 16:42.669
- Can we help you, Kylie?

16:42.711 --> 16:44.087
- I was compiling
some code at home

16:44.129 --> 16:45.380
and my computer got jammed

16:45.422 --> 16:47.007
and Alec said
I could work here.

16:47.048 --> 16:49.759
And he said he's expecting
some research from you

16:49.801 --> 16:50.844
for the kidnapping case?

16:50.885 --> 16:51.845
- Oh, I just sent it.

16:51.886 --> 16:53.805
- You go, Hermione.

16:53.847 --> 16:57.809
And he wants you to do the
lecture again this afternoon.

16:57.851 --> 17:00.020
- Wait, what?
Again?

17:00.061 --> 17:02.522
- Mm-hmm.
- No! That's an awful idea.

17:02.564 --> 17:04.733
- Okay.
So you gave a crappy lecture.

17:04.774 --> 17:06.276
You got bad reviews.

17:06.317 --> 17:09.195
And now, my mad scientist
brother wants you to go again.

17:09.237 --> 17:10.905
Look, if you bomb

17:10.947 --> 17:13.450
it won't be
the end of the world.

AIs will be
the end of the world.

17:15.618 --> 17:19.456
And that's two,
three years away at least.

17:19.497 --> 17:22.042
I'm just saying it's better
to live large and in charge

17:22.083 --> 17:25.462
before the robots come,
because they're coming.

17:25.503 --> 17:28.089
- Waiting for the singularity
is not the answer.

17:28.131 --> 17:30.967
It's a good thing you're upset.
It means you care.

17:31.009 --> 17:33.678

17:44.522 --> 17:47.734
I thought I would see if you
were ready to talk yet.

17:47.776 --> 17:49.819
- Got nothing to say.
All right?

17:49.861 --> 17:51.446
You've got me here on squat.

17:51.488 --> 17:54.657
Plus,
I can afford a good lawyer.

17:54.699 --> 17:56.951
So you might as well just
let me go and avoid a lawsuit.

17:56.993 --> 18:00.163
- Interesting
how Veronica drew you.

18:00.205 --> 18:02.040
It's like she saw
your best self.

18:02.082 --> 18:04.668
She trusted you.

18:04.709 --> 18:07.212
Was that a mistake?

18:07.253 --> 18:08.630
- I didn't know
she kept any of this.

18:08.672 --> 18:11.841
- We searched your home
and your grow house.

18:11.883 --> 18:13.510
She wasn't there,

18:13.551 --> 18:16.471
but you're still our best
suspect in her kidnapping--

18:16.513 --> 18:17.847
maybe even her murder.

18:17.889 --> 18:19.307
- Whoa, whoa.

18:19.349 --> 18:20.850
You think that
she might be dead?

18:20.892 --> 18:23.353
- No one's seen her since you
picked her up at her house.

18:23.395 --> 18:26.106
So either
you did something to her,

18:26.147 --> 18:30.527
or you're our best hope
in finding her alive.

18:30.568 --> 18:32.529
- Okay.

18:32.570 --> 18:33.738
When she called me,

18:33.780 --> 18:37.534
I thought she wanted
to get back together.

18:37.575 --> 18:39.369
It turned out she just
wanted to borrow money.

18:39.411 --> 18:41.121
- Money you made selling drugs?

18:41.162 --> 18:43.248
That's why
she broke up with you.

18:43.289 --> 18:45.834
You must have been angry.

18:45.875 --> 18:47.335
- It wasn't like that.
Okay?

18:47.377 --> 18:50.547
I just told her how I felt--
upset and used.

18:50.588 --> 18:52.841
And by the end of it,
she actually apologized to me.

18:52.882 --> 18:56.678
Then she texted somebody
for a ride and left my place.

18:56.720 --> 18:58.054
- Who gave her the ride?

18:58.096 --> 18:59.848
- No clue.

18:59.889 --> 19:01.266
Honestly, I smoked a bowl
and went to bed.

19:01.307 --> 19:04.436
- How much money
did she ask for?

19:04.477 --> 19:06.187
- 200 Gs.

19:06.229 --> 19:10.025
It was for NESD, the, uh,
New England School of Design.

19:10.066 --> 19:12.277
It was some fancy
private art college.

19:12.318 --> 19:15.905
She got accepted there,
which is a pretty big deal.

19:15.947 --> 19:17.490
Her family couldn't get aid,

19:17.532 --> 19:19.117
her father wouldn't let
her take out student loans,

19:19.159 --> 19:21.953
so she came to me.

19:21.995 --> 19:24.080
I said no and that was it.

19:24.122 --> 19:26.166
- You knew about
her relationship

19:26.207 --> 19:28.418
with the Akehurst family.

19:28.460 --> 19:31.254
So maybe you thought
there was a different way

19:31.296 --> 19:33.798
for you to make a bunch
of money for the both of you?

19:33.840 --> 19:35.258
- Kidnapping?

19:35.300 --> 19:38.386
Seriously,
why would I mess with that?

19:38.428 --> 19:40.096
Okay? I'm literally
making bank selling stuff

19:40.138 --> 19:42.640
that nobody gets busted for.

19:42.682 --> 19:44.601
I don't need the drama.

19:44.642 --> 19:45.685
- I'm beginning to worry

19:45.727 --> 19:49.022
that we may have
overlooked a suspect.

19:49.064 --> 19:50.273
Veronica.

19:50.315 --> 19:52.942
- You think
she kidnapped herself?

19:52.984 --> 19:54.027
- You heard Corey.

19:54.069 --> 19:55.612
She's in desperate need
of money.

19:55.653 --> 19:57.989
This could all be a scam
to fleece Ted Akehurst.

19:58.031 --> 20:01.117
- The way he talks
about Veronica,

20:01.159 --> 20:03.495
he still cares about her.

20:03.536 --> 20:05.121
I think he's telling the truth.

20:05.163 --> 20:07.624
- Then I defer
to your expertise.

20:07.665 --> 20:10.377
- I told you you don't need
to flirt with me.

20:10.418 --> 20:12.087
I'm on your side.
[Rose chuckles]

20:12.128 --> 20:14.839
- Ever consider that you're a
handsome and intelligent man,

20:14.881 --> 20:17.217
and that my flirting has
nothing to do with the case?

20:17.258 --> 20:18.426
- You only think
I'm handsome because

20:18.468 --> 20:20.011
you're standing
on my good side.

20:20.053 --> 20:21.304
- Scars add character.

20:21.346 --> 20:22.806
- Then I have
a lot of character.

20:22.847 --> 20:24.766
- Mm.

20:24.808 --> 20:28.061
- All hands--the father just
got a call from the kidnapper.

20:28.103 --> 20:29.646
[phone chiming]
- Uh, a video call.

20:29.688 --> 20:31.147
- Take it.

20:31.189 --> 20:32.691
Hold the phone close,
back against the wall.

20:32.732 --> 20:33.733
- Yeah.

20:33.775 --> 20:34.984
- So they can't
see where you are.

20:35.026 --> 20:36.444
- Uh-huh.

20:36.486 --> 20:37.737
- [crying] Daddy?
- Hey, Veronica, baby.

20:37.779 --> 20:39.114
Are you okay?
- [crying] Dad, I'm scared.

20:39.155 --> 20:41.074
- Okay. Hey, tell me
where you are, huh?

20:41.116 --> 20:43.493
Who took you?
How can I get you home?

20:43.535 --> 20:45.620
- [crying]
I can't tell you anything.

20:45.662 --> 20:50.417
I'm supposed to say
he knows about the FBI.

20:50.458 --> 20:52.877
So you have to stop
working with them.

20:52.919 --> 20:57.632
He wants his money
by sunrise tomorrow.

20:57.674 --> 21:01.011
And if you don't follow
his instructions...

21:01.052 --> 21:02.762
he's going to kill me.

21:03.638 --> 21:05.890
- Okay--

21:05.932 --> 21:08.101
[whimpering]
Wait.

21:14.190 --> 21:14.357
.

21:14.399 --> 21:15.483
- So you think
Veronica kidnapped herself?

21:16.484 --> 21:17.694
- Veronica needs money
for school.

21:17.736 --> 21:20.530
Corey said no.
Perhaps this was her solution.

21:20.572 --> 21:22.157
If so,
Veronica is not in danger

21:22.198 --> 21:24.200
and Trey can stop
putting together the ransom.

21:24.242 --> 21:27.454
- Eh, Veronica didn't seem like
she was acting.

21:27.495 --> 21:31.332
And she made it a point to call
out her kidnapper as a "he"--

21:31.374 --> 21:33.668
one person, armed and male.

21:33.710 --> 21:36.338
- But he didn't appear
on the screen.

21:36.379 --> 21:37.464
He could have been an
accomplice or not exist at all.

21:37.505 --> 21:38.757
- Okay.

21:38.798 --> 21:40.133
Okay, that's crazy.

21:40.175 --> 21:41.509
Alec, tell her that's crazy.

21:41.551 --> 21:44.012
- [sighs] As theories go,
it is not without merit,

21:44.054 --> 21:47.223
except Veronica's eyes.

21:47.265 --> 21:51.811
In the video call,
they kept darting to one side,

21:51.853 --> 21:55.148
especially when she mentioned
being shot or killed,

21:55.190 --> 21:57.359
like she was looking at a gun.

21:57.400 --> 21:58.526
I don't think
she can fake that.

21:58.568 --> 22:00.445
- She wasn't faking anything.

22:00.487 --> 22:02.989
If Veronica needed money from
me, all she had to do was ask.

22:03.031 --> 22:04.366
- What are you talking about?

22:04.407 --> 22:06.534
- I've always
supported Veronica's art,

22:06.576 --> 22:08.536
emotionally and financially.

22:08.578 --> 22:11.539
Canvases, paints,
life drawing classes,

22:11.581 --> 22:13.583
the art camp that she went
to last summer.

22:13.625 --> 22:16.002
Who do you think paid for that?

22:16.044 --> 22:18.046
Because you didn't.

22:18.088 --> 22:19.381
- You son of a--
- No!

22:19.422 --> 22:21.049
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- I saw that coming.

22:21.091 --> 22:22.676
- Let me go!
- Keith!

22:22.717 --> 22:25.762
Keith, remember what you said,
"I was the expert on mistakes."

22:25.804 --> 22:28.056
You're making one right now.

22:28.098 --> 22:30.558
Let's get some air.
Okay?

22:31.726 --> 22:32.811
[Keith huffs[

22:32.852 --> 22:34.354
- Oh, you should have
let me hit him!

22:34.396 --> 22:36.272
Did you see the way
he lorded his money over me,

22:36.314 --> 22:38.024
like I don't want
to give my daughter everything?

22:38.066 --> 22:40.026
And his pet suit
blaming Veronica.

22:40.068 --> 22:41.236
To hell with the both of them!

22:41.277 --> 22:42.570
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

22:42.612 --> 22:44.197
Getting angry in this
situation is natural,

22:44.239 --> 22:45.740
but it isn't helping, bruh.

22:45.782 --> 22:47.617
- You don't understand 'cause
you don't have children.

22:47.659 --> 22:48.910
- You're right.

22:48.952 --> 22:50.537
And I can't imagine
what you're going through.

22:50.578 --> 22:52.372
But pushing Ted right now
is not a good idea.

22:52.414 --> 22:56.084
- Veronica wouldn't need
a ransom if it wasn't for him.

22:56.126 --> 22:57.293
Now, granted,
I may have forced her

22:57.335 --> 22:59.212
to go to Corey
for that tuition money,

22:59.254 --> 23:02.257
but do you really think anyone
would have kidnapped Veronica

23:02.298 --> 23:04.217
if Ted wasn't in the picture?

23:04.259 --> 23:06.594
- No, I actually don't.

23:06.636 --> 23:09.764
Now, your wife used
to work with him.

23:09.806 --> 23:12.434
From what you know,

23:12.475 --> 23:17.230
is there anybody else who
feels about him the way you do?

23:17.272 --> 23:20.191
- Anyone who's ever met him.

23:20.233 --> 23:21.443
[indistinct chatter]

23:21.484 --> 23:24.404
- Hey, sweet one.
- Hey. You weren't lying.

23:24.446 --> 23:26.281
Ted Akehurst
is a real piece of work.

23:26.322 --> 23:28.575
He stiffs contractors,
pollutes the environment,

23:28.616 --> 23:30.201
stabs investors in the back.

23:30.243 --> 23:32.787
He is B-A-D, bad.

23:32.829 --> 23:35.790
Now, here are a list of
the Ted haters I found so far.

23:35.832 --> 23:37.876
Now, if you ask me,
some of them legit seem like

23:37.917 --> 23:40.462
they might murder or kidnap
to get their way.

23:40.503 --> 23:42.630
- Oh, which is a lot
more likely than Veronica

23:42.672 --> 23:44.090
kidnapping herself.
- Mm-hmm.

23:44.132 --> 23:45.425
- How do we narrow this down?

23:45.467 --> 23:48.887
- $2.7 million
is super specific.

23:48.928 --> 23:51.306
I can search the databases
at my jobs.

23:51.348 --> 23:53.141
They might have
some information

23:53.183 --> 23:54.559
that's not in public record,

23:54.601 --> 23:56.311
see if Ted screwed somebody
out of that exact amount.

23:56.353 --> 23:57.979
- Hold up.
Rewind.

23:58.021 --> 24:00.440
"Jobs."
Plural.

24:00.482 --> 24:01.983
- How else do you think
I pay for my product?

24:02.025 --> 24:03.526
[Alec laughs]

24:03.568 --> 24:06.071
- No, lots of techies have
multiple gigs these days.

24:06.112 --> 24:08.490
It's no big deal.
I got three.

24:08.531 --> 24:10.825
- Which explains
the texts and the calls.

24:10.867 --> 24:12.118
- Mm.

24:12.160 --> 24:15.538
My bosses are needy--
almost as needy as you.

24:15.580 --> 24:17.832
[soft upbeat music]

24:17.874 --> 24:20.085
- Professor, can we talk?

24:20.126 --> 24:23.338
I wanted to apologize
for tanking my lecture.

24:23.380 --> 24:24.673
- No need.

24:24.714 --> 24:27.092
I kind of expected
your lecture to go badly.

24:27.133 --> 24:29.803
I wanted to give it to you
anyway--and the next one.

24:29.844 --> 24:31.388
- You're okay
with me being terrible?

24:31.429 --> 24:32.972
- Don't tell anyone,

24:33.014 --> 24:35.350
but Phoebe's first big lecture
was atrocious, so was mine.

24:35.392 --> 24:37.143
- You were atrocious?

24:37.185 --> 24:39.396
- [laughs] A big lecture hall
with a few hundred students,

24:39.437 --> 24:41.231
half of whom don't
really want to be there?

24:41.272 --> 24:43.441
Being terrible
is the likely outcome,

24:43.483 --> 24:46.277
even a necessary one,
because...

24:46.319 --> 24:47.987
science.

24:48.029 --> 24:50.198
- When an experiment doesn't go
your way, that's information.

24:50.240 --> 24:51.741
- Exactly.

24:51.783 --> 24:53.368
You don't fail if you learn--
only if you stop.

24:53.410 --> 24:54.994
So give the lecture.
Learn.

24:55.036 --> 24:56.413
- Hmm.
[Rizwan exhales]

24:56.454 --> 24:58.206
Nice pep talk.

24:58.248 --> 25:00.208
I found something.

25:00.250 --> 25:01.668
- Let's hear it.
- Mm.

25:01.710 --> 25:03.586
According to this prospectus
I dug up,

25:03.628 --> 25:07.841
Ted founded a company
to develop micro-solar panels.

25:07.882 --> 25:10.593
But his startup had
a crazy high burn rate,

25:10.635 --> 25:12.387
so he went looking
for a capital infusion

25:12.429 --> 25:14.639
to the tune of $2.5 million.

25:14.681 --> 25:16.683
- Which isn't far
from $2.7 million.

25:16.725 --> 25:17.976
- Apparently,
if he doesn't get it,

25:18.018 --> 25:19.519
his investors are going
to lose their shirts.

25:19.561 --> 25:22.439
Maybe one of them figured
this is a way to stay afloat.

25:22.480 --> 25:23.523
- I don't get it.

25:23.565 --> 25:24.858
Ted Akehurst has
plenty of money.

25:24.899 --> 25:27.902
Why not self-finance?
- It's a good question.

25:27.944 --> 25:29.154
Wait.

25:29.195 --> 25:31.489
Ted is Theodore Akehurst Jr.

25:31.531 --> 25:34.200
This startup belongs
to Theodore Akehurst III,

25:34.242 --> 25:35.410
his son Trey.

25:35.452 --> 25:38.496
- Shoot.
Wrong Akehurst.

25:38.538 --> 25:40.081
But same issue, though.

25:40.123 --> 25:43.376
Why Trey go begging for money
when he has a rich-ass daddy?

25:43.418 --> 25:45.003
- I'm betting
his rich-ass daddy said no,

25:45.045 --> 25:46.588
which means Ted is willing
to give Veronica

25:46.629 --> 25:48.965
whatever she wants but
won't do that for his own son.

25:49.007 --> 25:50.258
You didn't get
the wrong Akehurst.

25:50.300 --> 25:51.301
You got the right one.

25:51.343 --> 25:52.761
- Rizwan,

25:52.802 --> 25:54.929
pull every study we've ever
done on zero-sum bias.

25:54.971 --> 25:57.098
- For the lecture?
- And for the case.

25:57.140 --> 26:00.018
[energetic suspenseful music]

26:00.060 --> 26:04.397
* *

26:04.439 --> 26:07.525
[phone ringing]

26:07.567 --> 26:08.985
* *

26:09.027 --> 26:11.321
- Dinshaw here.
Ready for the exchange.

26:11.363 --> 26:12.739
- Rose, it's Alec.

26:12.781 --> 26:15.408
Do not do the drop.
Trey is the kidnapper.

26:15.450 --> 26:19.329
Repeat, do not do the drop.

26:27.504 --> 26:27.712
.

26:27.754 --> 26:28.463
- Well, that was a disaster.

26:29.798 --> 26:32.759
- Is Veronica okay?
- I hope so. I never saw her.

26:32.801 --> 26:36.137
When Alec told me to cancel
the drop, I had to think fast.

26:36.179 --> 26:38.848
I said I'd found tracking chips
hidden in the money.

26:38.890 --> 26:40.642
I asked for them to reschedule.

26:40.684 --> 26:42.894
- And the kidnapper bought it?
- He seemed to.

26:42.936 --> 26:45.939
He was angry, but he said
he wouldn't hurt Veronica--yet.

26:45.980 --> 26:47.357
Though, he did
move up the timeline.

26:47.399 --> 26:49.359
We now have until midnight.
- Mm.

26:49.401 --> 26:50.485
- You're sure this is Trey?

26:50.527 --> 26:51.653
- We're sure.

26:51.695 --> 26:52.946
- I pulled
Trey's phone records.

26:52.987 --> 26:54.614
His cell phone has
been going on and off line

26:54.656 --> 26:55.949
for the past two days.

26:55.990 --> 26:57.450
When it's off,

26:57.492 --> 26:59.536
it's completely signal-dead
like it's in a Faraday bag.

26:59.577 --> 27:02.247
The downtimes match
with the ransom calls.

27:02.288 --> 27:04.958
- So he bags his own phone
when dealing with Veronica,

27:05.000 --> 27:06.835
then uses hers
to make ransom calls.

27:06.876 --> 27:08.753
- Then there's
the ransom amount.

27:08.795 --> 27:12.549
$2.7 million is
exactly what Trey needs

27:12.590 --> 27:14.384
to keep his business afloat

27:14.426 --> 27:16.803
plus what Veronica wants
for school.

27:16.845 --> 27:18.263
- You make it seem
as if Trey and Veronica

27:18.304 --> 27:20.765
are working together.
- Come on now. There's no way.

27:20.807 --> 27:22.809
Veronica dumped Corey
for dealing drugs.

27:22.851 --> 27:24.936
She'd never partake
in a fake kidnapping.

27:24.978 --> 27:26.271
- I agree.

27:26.312 --> 27:27.564
But I think that when Trey
came up with the idea,

27:27.605 --> 27:29.691
he thought that Veronica
would go along with it.

27:29.733 --> 27:31.735
That's where he came up
with the ransom number.

27:31.776 --> 27:33.903
- That's the, um,
anchoring thing, right,

27:33.945 --> 27:36.448
where one sets a--
a set price in their mind,

27:36.489 --> 27:37.741
and it's tough to change it?

27:37.782 --> 27:40.702
- Even after Veronica
refused to cooperate.

27:40.744 --> 27:43.580
- You truly believe
Trey might kill Veronica?

27:43.621 --> 27:45.331
They're very nearly
brother and sister.

27:45.373 --> 27:47.542
- Unfortunately,
pseudo-sibling bonds

27:47.584 --> 27:49.794
can also lead
to pseudo-sibling rivalries.

27:49.836 --> 27:52.213
- I assume that
Trey picked up Veronica

27:52.255 --> 27:54.257
after she argued with Corey.

27:54.299 --> 27:55.884
- Something set him off.

27:55.925 --> 27:57.969
Best guess,
she floated the idea

27:58.011 --> 28:01.973
of getting the money from Ted
just two days after his father

28:02.015 --> 28:04.267
refused to bail out
his startup.

28:04.309 --> 28:07.604
- That would have made
Trey angry, jealous, wronged.

28:07.645 --> 28:08.813
- Exactly.

28:08.855 --> 28:10.815
Because the classic
sibling rivalry

28:10.857 --> 28:13.485
is fueled by
a predictable irrationality

28:13.526 --> 28:15.403
called zero-sum bias.

28:15.445 --> 28:19.783
Zero-sum bias is the misbelief
that non-material resources

28:19.824 --> 28:23.703
like love, respect,
even good grades

28:23.745 --> 28:27.248
are finite
such that if one person wins,

28:27.290 --> 28:29.501
then another one has to lose.

28:29.542 --> 28:31.461
The worst part
about zero-sum bias

28:31.503 --> 28:32.879
is that it can make
a situation

28:32.921 --> 28:36.633
where everyone could win
into a cutthroat competition,

28:36.675 --> 28:38.843
making win-win into win-lose.

28:38.885 --> 28:42.472
- Today, we're going
to talk about zero-sum bias.

28:42.514 --> 28:45.016
But first, prizes.

28:45.058 --> 28:48.311
We have gifts for everyone
who did well on the last quiz.

28:48.353 --> 28:50.230
Party streamers.

28:50.271 --> 28:51.940
[streamers pop]
Whoo.

28:51.981 --> 28:55.985
Rondo, A-minus.
You get a prize.

28:56.027 --> 29:00.490
Morales, A.
One for you.

29:00.532 --> 29:04.452
Starks, A-minus.
Catch.

29:04.494 --> 29:05.745
Nice.

29:05.787 --> 29:08.164
Now it's Wu's turn.
We've had three As.

29:08.206 --> 29:09.958
So who thinks
Wu will also get a prize?

29:10.000 --> 29:12.627
[indistinct murmuring]
Only 20%.

29:12.669 --> 29:14.713
And the correct answer is...

29:14.754 --> 29:18.299
Wu also got an A.
[chuckles and applause]

29:18.341 --> 29:21.428
Streamers!
[laughter]

29:21.469 --> 29:23.054
And that's zero-sum bias.

29:23.096 --> 29:24.681
You made the mistake of
believing the first three As

29:24.723 --> 29:25.849
meant there wouldn't
be a fourth,

29:25.890 --> 29:27.517
but the truth is most
of you did great.

29:27.559 --> 29:30.270
So streamers for everyone.

29:30.311 --> 29:31.646
[indistinct murmuring]

29:31.688 --> 29:33.690
- Now, for families,

29:33.732 --> 29:36.109
zero-sum bias
can make children believe

29:36.151 --> 29:38.319
that their parents' love
is a limited resource

29:38.361 --> 29:40.530
and the more one child gets,

29:40.572 --> 29:43.116
the less there is
for anyone else.

29:43.158 --> 29:47.579
In Trey's eyes, Veronica
stole his father's love.

29:47.620 --> 29:50.874
- We believe that Trey just
did this spur-of-the-moment

29:50.915 --> 29:54.002
after he picked up Veronica,

29:54.044 --> 29:57.297
which means that
she knows who took her.

29:57.339 --> 30:00.633
- Then even if he gets
the money, he can't let her go.

30:00.675 --> 30:02.093
[Alec sighs]

30:02.135 --> 30:06.139
- Please, we need to
find her before it's too late.

30:06.181 --> 30:08.099
- He's right.
We don't have much time.

30:08.141 --> 30:11.186
When Trey took Veronica,
he was in a hot state.

30:11.227 --> 30:13.271
If we go back to the place
where he picked her up,

30:13.313 --> 30:15.523
do you think you can determine
where he would have gone,

30:15.565 --> 30:16.941
like what you did with Corey?

30:16.983 --> 30:18.735
- Maybe, but Onancock's
a long way.

30:18.777 --> 30:21.529
- Wait.
Corey lives in Onancock?

30:21.571 --> 30:25.241
That's on Cape Charles, right?
- Yeah, half way up on the 13.

30:26.785 --> 30:28.787
- [sighs] This is Rose.
Call me back.

30:28.828 --> 30:30.330
It's urgent.

30:30.372 --> 30:31.539
- What's wrong?

30:31.581 --> 30:33.291
- I did some preliminary
security workups

30:33.333 --> 30:34.501
to Trey's company,

30:34.542 --> 30:36.461
including on a vacant factory
in Sheraton.

30:36.503 --> 30:38.838
- That's a straight shot
down the 13 from Onancock.

30:38.880 --> 30:40.548
We should check it out.

30:40.590 --> 30:42.258
- Unfortunately,
after Alec called,

30:42.300 --> 30:46.096
I called Ted and shared with
him our suspicions about Trey.

30:46.137 --> 30:47.639
Now his phone's going
straight to voicemail.

30:47.681 --> 30:49.516
And he knows about
the factory in Sheraton.

30:49.557 --> 30:50.767
- Everything Trey's done was

30:50.809 --> 30:52.519
triggered
by his father's rejection.

30:52.560 --> 30:54.104
And Veronica said
Trey has a gun.

30:54.145 --> 30:56.314
We need to get to that
factory before Ted does.

30:56.356 --> 30:58.233
- I'll meet you downstairs.
- Yeah.

30:58.274 --> 31:00.443
[tense music]

31:00.485 --> 31:02.320
* *

31:02.362 --> 31:04.739
- Please just let me go.

31:04.781 --> 31:06.950
I won't tell anyone it was you.
Please.

31:06.991 --> 31:08.284
- I wish I could believe you,

31:08.326 --> 31:09.869
but you're terrible
at keeping secrets.

31:09.911 --> 31:11.955
You told everyone
about the affair, including me.

31:11.996 --> 31:13.415
You won't be able
to stop yourself

31:13.456 --> 31:15.208
from telling your
psycho father what I did--

31:15.250 --> 31:16.126
or mine.

31:16.167 --> 31:17.752
[door slams]
[Veronica gasps]

31:17.794 --> 31:18.962
Who's there?

31:19.004 --> 31:21.131
[handgun hammer clicks]
Show yourself!

31:21.172 --> 31:23.341
[door slams]

31:23.383 --> 31:26.261
- Trey.

31:26.302 --> 31:28.805
What are you doing?

31:28.847 --> 31:31.641
Veronica, are you all right?
[Veronica sobbing]

31:31.683 --> 31:34.394
- Get away from her.

31:34.436 --> 31:37.188
[Ted sighs]

31:37.230 --> 31:40.191
[thunder rumbling]

31:40.233 --> 31:45.447
* *

31:45.488 --> 31:47.699
[gunshot]

31:53.204 --> 31:53.371
.

31:53.413 --> 31:54.080
- Stop, or I'll shoot her!

31:54.789 --> 31:57.250
- I just came to talk.

31:57.292 --> 31:59.294
I feel like what's
happening here is my fault.

31:59.336 --> 32:02.047
I'd have gotten here sooner,
but, you know,

32:02.088 --> 32:04.466
there was so much snow.

32:04.507 --> 32:06.718
- Snow?
It's not snowing.

32:06.760 --> 32:08.970
- Sorry, Eddy.
I stand corrected.

32:09.012 --> 32:11.431
- My name's Trey!

32:11.473 --> 32:12.640
- What is he doing?

32:12.682 --> 32:14.267
- He's using absurdism.

32:14.309 --> 32:16.144
He's saying weird things
to force Trey to correct him

32:16.186 --> 32:18.021
and ground himself in reality.

32:18.063 --> 32:19.814
It's a way to puncture
his hot state.

32:19.856 --> 32:22.400
- Right.
You're Trey.

32:22.442 --> 32:23.818
Your father's Ted.

32:23.860 --> 32:25.487
And your sister's Virginia.

32:25.528 --> 32:28.490
- Her name is Veronica,
and she's not my sister!

32:28.531 --> 32:29.783
- Great.
We agree on the facts.

32:29.824 --> 32:31.159
She's not your sister.

32:31.201 --> 32:33.286
You shot your father
and he's bleeding to death.

32:33.328 --> 32:36.164
Also, Agent Clark
is just beyond that door.

32:36.206 --> 32:37.791
And there's more FBI
on the way.

32:37.832 --> 32:39.501
So let's look at your options.

32:39.542 --> 32:41.294
You could try to kill
everyone else here,

32:41.336 --> 32:43.922
but Agent Clark
is a really good shot.

32:43.963 --> 32:45.507
And the only reason
she hasn't taken you out yet

32:45.548 --> 32:47.759
is I asked her to let us talk.

32:47.801 --> 32:52.347
So if you choose that path,
you get shot and/or arrested.

32:52.389 --> 32:53.390
You lose.

32:53.431 --> 32:54.516
- That's my only choice.

32:54.557 --> 32:55.600
And there's no other way.

32:55.642 --> 32:58.228
- But that's not true.

32:58.269 --> 33:02.899
There's always a way to improve
even the worst situation.

33:02.941 --> 33:07.237
What does the best outcome
look like for you, Trey?

33:07.278 --> 33:09.781
- I get the money.
And I get away.

33:09.823 --> 33:11.366
- Not realistic.

33:11.408 --> 33:13.368
We need to think
of the best possible options.

33:13.410 --> 33:16.454
Besides, the money's
not what you want anyway.

33:16.496 --> 33:18.373
You want your father's love.

33:18.415 --> 33:19.791
That's your win.

33:19.833 --> 33:21.334
You thought Veronica
stole it from you,

33:21.376 --> 33:24.587
but love's not
a limited resource.

33:24.629 --> 33:26.631
Think about this.

33:26.673 --> 33:28.800
When your father knew that
Veronica was in trouble,

33:28.842 --> 33:30.260
he hired Rose.

33:30.301 --> 33:31.678
He delegated.

33:31.720 --> 33:35.557
What did he do when
he thought you were in trouble?

33:35.598 --> 33:37.726
- He came here himself?

33:37.767 --> 33:39.728
[sobbing]
And I shot him.

33:39.769 --> 33:40.979
I didn't mean to do this.

33:41.021 --> 33:42.272
I didn't mean
to do any of this.

33:42.313 --> 33:43.523
- I know.

33:43.565 --> 33:47.027
And now you know
that your father loves you.

33:47.068 --> 33:48.570
[Trey breathing shakily]

33:48.611 --> 33:51.823
- If he and Veronica live,
you'll find a way through this.

33:51.865 --> 33:55.076
But if your father dies,
you go to prison,

33:55.118 --> 33:56.703
maybe even for the rest
of your life.

33:56.745 --> 34:01.082
And you lose his love forever.

34:01.124 --> 34:06.504
So please, Trey,
put the gun down.

34:06.546 --> 34:09.507
[tense music]

34:09.549 --> 34:11.760
* *

34:11.801 --> 34:14.763
[Ted breathing wheezily]

34:14.804 --> 34:18.725
[Veronica sobbing softly]

34:18.767 --> 34:23.938
Put the gun down.

34:23.980 --> 34:26.608
[Ted shuddering and panting]

34:26.649 --> 34:29.611
[soft dramatic music]

34:29.652 --> 34:36.534
* *

34:38.787 --> 34:42.082
- Mom! Dad!
- Veronica!

34:42.123 --> 34:44.876
Come here, come here.
- [sobbing] Oh, my God.

34:44.918 --> 34:47.671
- Come here. Are you okay?
Huh?

34:47.712 --> 34:49.464
[Veronica sobbing]
Okay, okay.

34:49.506 --> 34:51.299
- Oh, my God.

34:51.341 --> 34:56.346
- I'm no expert, but that
looks like a win-win-win.

34:56.388 --> 34:59.641
You should let me buy you
a fancy dinner to celebrate.

34:59.683 --> 35:00.892
I'll expense it to Ted.

35:00.934 --> 35:03.561
- You want to learn more
about zero-sum bias?

35:03.603 --> 35:05.271
- Among other things.

35:05.313 --> 35:08.191
[indistinct radio chatter]

35:09.818 --> 35:10.985
- Congratulations.

35:11.027 --> 35:12.112
You got her back,
and no one died.

35:12.153 --> 35:13.613
- Yeah, sometimes you win.

35:13.655 --> 35:15.699
- Maybe this is
the start of a streak.

35:15.740 --> 35:18.410
I came to tell you the
church bomber, Wes Banning,

35:18.451 --> 35:20.995
finally responded
to your interview requests.

35:21.037 --> 35:23.748
He's agreed to talk.

35:23.790 --> 35:25.667
[Marisa chuckles softly]

35:25.709 --> 35:32.674
* *

35:32.716 --> 35:33.800
[elevator bell rings]

35:33.842 --> 35:35.135
- "Adequate."
Three stars.

35:35.176 --> 35:37.178
"Fun, actually."
Four stars.

35:37.220 --> 35:39.014
"Kinda interesting."
Three stars.

35:39.055 --> 35:40.306
- It's still not great.

35:40.348 --> 35:41.933
- Better, though.
Better is good.

35:41.975 --> 35:43.476
- The giveaway
totally primed them.

35:43.518 --> 35:44.602
Thanks for that.

35:44.644 --> 35:47.272
Honestly,
I wasn't expecting your help.

35:47.313 --> 35:48.690
- Because sibling rivalry?

35:48.732 --> 35:50.191
- Mm-hmm.
[chuckles]

35:50.233 --> 35:51.693
- Look, I'll admit I can
be prone to zero-sum bias.

35:51.735 --> 35:55.488
But we study biases
in order to overcome them.

35:55.530 --> 35:57.824
We're a team.
We win or lose together.

35:57.866 --> 35:59.701
- Almost sounds like
you believe that.

35:59.743 --> 36:02.704
- Yeah, I almost do.

36:02.746 --> 36:05.707
[soft upbeat music]

36:05.749 --> 36:07.876
* *

36:07.917 --> 36:09.044
- Dr. Mercer.

36:09.085 --> 36:10.211
- Keith.

36:10.253 --> 36:11.588
- Hey, uh, sorry to bother you.

36:11.629 --> 36:15.216
But I made this for you
as a thank you.

36:15.258 --> 36:17.927
- Wow.
This is beautiful.

36:17.969 --> 36:20.805
Hey, I tell you what.
I'll trade you.

36:20.847 --> 36:21.931
You didn't get
your signed book.

36:21.973 --> 36:23.266
- Oh.

36:25.435 --> 36:29.814
- So I take it
by this beautiful gift

36:29.856 --> 36:33.234
that things are well
now that Veronica is home?

36:33.276 --> 36:37.030
- She's been through a lot,
but kids are resilient.

36:37.072 --> 36:38.948
None of this
would have happened

36:38.990 --> 36:41.576
if I hadn't
screwed things up with her.

36:41.618 --> 36:43.912
- Well, you projected your
perceived failures onto her.

36:43.953 --> 36:45.580
- Mm.

36:45.622 --> 36:48.291
And I see now I have to let
her make her own mistakes.

36:48.333 --> 36:50.418
- Sadly--
[sighs]

36:50.460 --> 36:53.546
Mistakes are often
the best ways to learn.

36:53.588 --> 36:56.633
- [laughs] Then Tara and I have
learned a lot over the years.

36:56.675 --> 36:59.302
- Mm.

36:59.344 --> 37:01.638
- It's good you called out
the affair.

37:01.680 --> 37:05.266
It helps us to remember
where we went wrong.

37:05.308 --> 37:08.019
And where we went right.

37:08.061 --> 37:09.270
- Sir.

37:09.312 --> 37:12.774
- Ah.
[chuckles]

37:12.816 --> 37:15.443
Wow.

37:15.485 --> 37:19.155
Hey, why didn't you
and Agent Clark have kids?

37:19.197 --> 37:22.117
You'd be a great dad.
[laughter]

37:22.158 --> 37:23.993
- We weighed the pros and cons.

37:24.035 --> 37:29.124
And the whole endeavor
seemed...

37:29.165 --> 37:31.918
entirely irrational.

37:31.960 --> 37:35.213
- Ooh, it is.
[laughter]

37:35.255 --> 37:38.466
I mean, having Veronica
derailed our lives.

37:38.508 --> 37:41.636
- Mm.
- I abandoned my art.

37:41.678 --> 37:46.391
Ended up resenting Tara,
which led to the affair.

37:46.433 --> 37:51.980
But, mm, I wouldn't
trade Veronica for the world.

37:52.022 --> 37:53.106
- Mm, heard that.

37:53.148 --> 37:55.525
- Mm-hmm.
[chuckles]

37:55.567 --> 37:58.403
* *

37:58.445 --> 38:00.780
- * Run to the rock *

38:00.822 --> 38:02.782
* The rock was a-melting *

38:02.824 --> 38:04.868
both: * Run to the rock *

38:04.909 --> 38:06.661
* The rock was a-melting *

38:06.703 --> 38:09.080
* Run to the rock *
[rhythmic snapping]

38:09.122 --> 38:11.041
* The rock was a-melting *

38:11.082 --> 38:13.626
* All on that day *

38:13.668 --> 38:16.046
- Oh, somebody
is in a good mood!

38:16.087 --> 38:17.839
- Mm-hmm.

38:17.881 --> 38:21.009
Crawdad dinner for my brother
because your sister loves you.

38:21.051 --> 38:22.594
- Wait a minute.
[Kylie chuckles]

38:22.635 --> 38:24.304
Your computer is off.
Your phone's not buzzing.

38:24.346 --> 38:26.765
- Mm-hmm.
- What happened?

38:26.806 --> 38:28.641
- Rizwan happened.

38:28.683 --> 38:30.560
You know, when I saw

38:30.602 --> 38:32.854
how freaked out he was
over those bad reviews,

38:32.896 --> 38:36.107
I realized he really cares
about what he does.

38:36.149 --> 38:37.525
And I want to care, too.

38:37.567 --> 38:40.320
So maybe I can stop
having to choose

38:40.362 --> 38:43.031
between work and my happiness.

38:43.073 --> 38:44.699
He'll find the right job.

38:44.741 --> 38:45.867
I can have both.

38:45.909 --> 38:47.702
- Win-win.
- Mm-hmm.

38:47.744 --> 38:50.163
So I quit my jobs.

38:50.205 --> 38:51.706
- All of them?

38:51.748 --> 38:54.209
- Working three jobs made it
so I could save a nice pile

38:54.250 --> 38:56.419
and gave me enough time
to figure out

38:56.461 --> 38:57.962
what color my parachute is.

38:58.004 --> 38:59.422
- Mm.

38:59.464 --> 39:01.549
- Meantime, you owe me
a Benji for groceries.

39:01.591 --> 39:03.051
- It's worth it.
- [laughs]

39:03.093 --> 39:04.552
- You doubled the spices?

39:04.594 --> 39:06.471
- Of course
I doubled the spices.

39:06.513 --> 39:09.391
Who you talking to?
[laughter]

39:09.432 --> 39:12.310
[soft dramatic music]

39:12.352 --> 39:15.772
* *

39:15.814 --> 39:19.234
- Agent Clark,
author of all my troubles.

39:19.275 --> 39:20.485
- You're a serial bomber.

39:20.527 --> 39:21.653
That's the cause
of your troubles.

39:21.695 --> 39:23.822
I'm just the one
who caught you.

39:23.863 --> 39:25.782
I hear you're ready
to make a full confession?

39:25.824 --> 39:28.493
- Cassette tape-recorder.

39:28.535 --> 39:31.705
I like that.
Keeping it old-school.

39:31.746 --> 39:33.206
- It stops the defense
from arguing

39:33.248 --> 39:35.792
that your confession
is digitally altered.

39:35.834 --> 39:37.335
[button clicks]

39:37.377 --> 39:40.588
Subject, Wes Banning.
Interviewer, Marisa Clark.

39:40.630 --> 39:42.298
Session one.

39:45.093 --> 39:47.887
Any time you're ready.

39:47.929 --> 39:49.014
- Straight to it then.

39:49.055 --> 39:50.598
- Mm.

39:50.640 --> 39:51.808
- It was me.

39:51.850 --> 39:55.770
I bombed the Methodist Church,
April 2002.

39:55.812 --> 39:59.107
There was a big boom
and then fire.

39:59.149 --> 40:01.609
I like fire.

40:01.651 --> 40:03.319
13 dead.
Will that suffice?

40:03.361 --> 40:04.863
- You worked alone?

40:04.904 --> 40:06.239
- Of course.

40:06.281 --> 40:08.324
Check my grade school
report cards.

40:08.366 --> 40:10.660
"Does not work or play well
with others."

40:10.702 --> 40:16.082
- For over a decade,
you refused to admit anything.

40:16.124 --> 40:19.669
Then right when
you can walk free, you confess.

40:19.711 --> 40:22.464
First the parole hearing,
now this.

40:22.505 --> 40:23.798
Why the change of heart?

40:23.840 --> 40:27.093
- Say I found religion.

40:27.135 --> 40:29.304
Say I don't want to sin again.

40:29.346 --> 40:32.557
- I was at that hearing.

40:32.599 --> 40:36.811
You said all the right things
until someone walked in.

40:36.853 --> 40:38.146
Someone I didn't see.

40:38.188 --> 40:41.316
Then you changed your story.

40:41.358 --> 40:43.318
Who was it?

40:43.360 --> 40:44.819
What do they have over you?

40:44.861 --> 40:48.365
- [chuckles]
A dangerous mystery man.

40:48.406 --> 40:50.533
[chuckles] That's--

40:50.575 --> 40:52.619
that's quite the fabulation.

40:52.660 --> 40:55.955
- Or you're covering
for an accomplice.

40:55.997 --> 40:57.415
Maybe he was the one that

40:57.457 --> 40:59.834
drove that stolen FedEx van
that you used to get away.

40:59.876 --> 41:01.961
- I drove the FedEx van.

41:02.003 --> 41:03.004
I'm a lone wolf.

41:03.046 --> 41:06.132
- It wasn't a FedEx van.

41:06.174 --> 41:09.135
[tense music]

41:09.177 --> 41:10.970
* *

41:11.012 --> 41:14.599
And you would know that
if you had been at that church.

41:14.641 --> 41:17.435
You may have made that bomb,
but you didn't plant it.

41:17.477 --> 41:19.270
Did you?
- It was me.

41:19.312 --> 41:20.563
It was all me.

41:20.605 --> 41:22.774
- Then describe
the getaway vehicle.

41:22.816 --> 41:25.026
Color, company logo.

41:25.068 --> 41:26.486
- Guards!
- Anything.

41:26.528 --> 41:28.363
- Get me out of here.
I'm done.

41:28.405 --> 41:34.327
* *

41:34.369 --> 41:37.288
[shackles clicking]

41:37.330 --> 41:42.377
* *

41:42.419 --> 41:44.087
- End session.
[door clanks]

41:44.129 --> 41:46.297
[button clicks]

41:46.339 --> 41:49.259
[Marisa sighs]
