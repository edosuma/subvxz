00:03.078 --> 00:05.193
[Creature howling]

00:05.194 --> 00:07.671
Whatever jumped off the back of my house,

00:07.672 --> 00:10.525
landed 20 feet out in
the middle of my yard.

00:10.526 --> 00:13.041
Nothing can do that.

00:13.042 --> 00:17.318
There was definitely
something inside that house.

00:17.319 --> 00:18.264
Stop!

00:18.265 --> 00:20.714
I know I'm not going nuts,

00:20.715 --> 00:25.786
but I'm seeing something, and
what I'm seeing is there, but...

00:25.787 --> 00:28.054
It's not.

00:28.055 --> 00:31.258
Something was out there, stalking me.

00:31.259 --> 00:33.899

01:00.636 --> 01:03.216
[Loons calling]

01:05.525 --> 01:07.986
[Dog barking]

01:13.473 --> 01:16.274
Diane and I were childhood sweethearts.

01:16.275 --> 01:19.511
We grew up out in London, Ohio.

01:19.512 --> 01:23.352
It's, like, a small rural town.

01:24.350 --> 01:27.052
We'd been married for about six years.

01:27.053 --> 01:30.889
We had a four-year-old
daughter called Raven.

01:30.890 --> 01:34.493
For us, it was just a normal life.

01:34.494 --> 01:40.394
I found this little house with the woods in
the back, and I was so excited about it.

01:41.701 --> 01:44.336
During the day, I worked
as a welder in a shop,

01:44.337 --> 01:50.237
and in the evening hours, I went to night
school to study for an apprentice program.

01:50.443 --> 01:56.263
About 12 hours of the day, she
was alone there by herself.

02:03.656 --> 02:06.058
[Distant rustling]

02:06.059 --> 02:10.019
I started to hear things outside...

02:10.830 --> 02:14.070
Little scampering noises.

02:14.767 --> 02:20.667
I would look out to see if I could see
anything, and I didn't see anything there.

02:21.288 --> 02:27.108
I thought, well, maybe it's a
dog, or maybe it's a deer.

02:27.847 --> 02:30.082
I'm not a nervy person.

02:30.083 --> 02:34.523
I lived out in the country all my life.

02:53.473 --> 02:56.233
[Gravel crunching]

02:57.210 --> 03:00.090
This is not right.

03:08.521 --> 03:11.056
[Muffled thump]

03:11.057 --> 03:13.757
And I see eyes.

03:15.094 --> 03:20.494
I was like, okay, so there's
a dog loose out there.

03:35.014 --> 03:40.914
I no longer thought it was a dog, because
the eyes I was seeing were at eye level.

03:46.926 --> 03:49.086
[Shrieks]

03:50.696 --> 03:54.836
Something was out there, stalking me.

03:59.639 --> 04:01.799
[Screams]

04:12.685 --> 04:17.422
When I came home, she was
animated, very upset.

04:17.423 --> 04:21.326
I told Keith, something's
out there watching us.

04:21.327 --> 04:23.727
I'm scared.

04:24.964 --> 04:28.851
I took a flashlight out and shined around.

04:28.852 --> 04:32.204
Looked for tracks or any sign that
anyone could have been around.

04:32.205 --> 04:37.864
And being satisfied that I saw no evidence
of that, I tried to reassure her.

04:37.865 --> 04:39.609
He did not believe me.

04:39.610 --> 04:41.125
You calling me a liar?

04:41.126 --> 04:43.184
And, of course, she
became defensive of that.

04:43.185 --> 04:44.686
Because I saw it!

04:44.687 --> 04:48.452
I attributed it to a reflection...

04:48.453 --> 04:51.747
Or maybe just her nerves.

04:51.748 --> 04:56.788
But there's no way it
could have been anything.

04:58.698 --> 05:00.432
[Whispers] Good night.

05:00.433 --> 05:02.893
Sweet dreams.

05:45.486 --> 05:51.306
And I see 'em close.
I mean, they're close to the window.

05:52.685 --> 05:56.421
And I backed into the living room,
thinking, well, you know, okay,

05:56.422 --> 06:00.322
I'm out of that window's sight.

06:10.770 --> 06:15.030
But then it came to that window also.

06:18.577 --> 06:22.547
And I'm thinking, well, what
if I turn out the lights?

06:22.548 --> 06:25.358
If I turn out all the lights...

06:25.359 --> 06:30.639
Then they can't see me,
but maybe I can see them.

06:33.392 --> 06:38.396
I flipped the switch, and the
living room light went out.

06:38.397 --> 06:41.666
I was evening the score.

06:41.667 --> 06:44.669
I was feeling scared.

06:44.670 --> 06:49.170
I flipped the switch for the dining room.

07:13.032 --> 07:16.692
It was someone standing there.

07:18.537 --> 07:20.038
I was very frightened.

07:20.039 --> 07:25.176
I thought this person could come into my
home and hurt me or hurt my daughter,

07:25.177 --> 07:27.879
maybe even kill us.

07:27.880 --> 07:29.381
[Touch-tones beeping]

07:29.382 --> 07:30.782
[Line rings]

07:30.783 --> 07:32.917
I dial the police, and I tell them...

07:32.918 --> 07:35.420
Yes, there's someone outside my house.

07:35.421 --> 07:37.989
I need somebody to come out.

07:37.990 --> 07:39.970
Hurry.

07:52.138 --> 07:53.838
[Gravel crunching]

07:53.839 --> 07:56.059
It moved.

07:57.510 --> 08:03.410
It moved from the dining room
closer to the back of the house.

08:03.682 --> 08:07.235
When are the police gonna come?
They're taking forever.

08:07.236 --> 08:09.636
I'm scared.

08:10.348 --> 08:13.348
Someone's out there.

08:19.931 --> 08:22.451
[Loud banging]

08:25.571 --> 08:27.201
[Knock at door]

08:27.202 --> 08:28.931
Hello.

08:28.932 --> 08:30.642
So then the police come.

08:30.643 --> 08:33.144
They said, we're gonna go look around back.

08:33.145 --> 08:37.284
Ms. Williams, you need to calm down.

08:41.854 --> 08:47.754
I could see the police officers outside,
walking around with flashlights.

08:52.342 --> 08:55.806
But they don't see anything.

08:55.807 --> 08:59.107
And then Keith pulls in.

08:59.164 --> 09:02.448
They said, maybe we have
a nervous wife here.

09:02.449 --> 09:04.417
And that was my thought as well.

09:04.418 --> 09:06.061
There's something out there,
and I know there is.

09:06.062 --> 09:08.010
He was very upset with me.

09:08.011 --> 09:09.827
I'm sorry for this.

09:09.828 --> 09:11.724
What do you do?

09:11.725 --> 09:13.708
I was trying to ease her mind.

09:13.709 --> 09:16.451
I wanted her to be happy.

09:16.452 --> 09:21.957
But with no way to prove whether or
not anyone was there, what do you do?

09:21.958 --> 09:24.873
No. You know what? No. Just don't!

09:24.874 --> 09:29.211
And I kept telling him and telling him, and
he just acted like, it'll be all right.

09:29.212 --> 09:32.014
You know, we just...
You wanted to move here.

09:32.015 --> 09:34.616
We moved here.
We're not going to move again.

09:34.617 --> 09:37.357
There's nothing out there!
You're imagining it!

09:37.358 --> 09:40.089
I'm not imagining it!
Look, you're not here.

09:40.090 --> 09:44.710
I'm the one who's here. You're not here.

09:54.671 --> 09:59.174
It was just before the holiday season,
late November, early December.

09:59.175 --> 10:03.135
It had snowed for the first time.

10:03.213 --> 10:06.048
I got up before everyone else,
and it was before daylight.

10:06.049 --> 10:11.949
And I decided, well, maybe I'll go
get some doughnuts for everyone.

10:21.765 --> 10:23.332
As I started the car...

10:23.333 --> 10:26.034
[Engine turning over]

10:26.035 --> 10:31.039
I was rubbing my eyes, little
run-down from the week.

10:31.040 --> 10:36.412
I'm looking in the rear view
mirror, and I rub my eyes again.

10:36.413 --> 10:39.833
And I turn on the lights.

10:45.555 --> 10:51.260
This all happened in a matter
of seconds, bang, bang, bang.

10:51.261 --> 10:54.621
And I was looking around.

10:56.266 --> 10:59.935
Did I see something, or did I not?

10:59.936 --> 11:05.836
Here I am in the same position
that my wife had been earlier.

11:07.243 --> 11:11.083
I thought, you're seeing things.

11:16.119 --> 11:19.239
I just stopped, froze.

11:21.124 --> 11:25.894
There were tracks going over the
roof, and at that point, I knew.

11:25.895 --> 11:29.615
Yes, there was something there.

11:40.827 --> 11:43.527
I called Dennis.

11:43.529 --> 11:45.664
Dennis was an old friend
of mine I grew up with,

11:45.665 --> 11:48.634
and we'd hunted together many times.

11:48.635 --> 11:51.303
And I got a thirty-thirty rifle.

11:51.304 --> 11:53.305
He says, what are you doing with that?

11:53.306 --> 11:56.008
You know you can't shoot that around here.

11:56.009 --> 11:57.609
I may have to.

11:57.610 --> 12:00.130
He said, why?

12:02.890 --> 12:06.730
He said, what the hell is that?

12:07.027 --> 12:09.683
Whatever jumped off the back of my house

12:09.684 --> 12:14.201
landed 20 feet out in
the middle of my yard.

12:14.202 --> 12:17.136
Nothing can do that.

12:17.137 --> 12:19.172
We both stood there with
our mouths wide open.

12:19.173 --> 12:21.093
What?

12:24.478 --> 12:29.916
We could tell whatever we
were looking at wasn't human.

12:29.917 --> 12:32.552
The tracks were about 14 inches long.

12:32.553 --> 12:34.336
It's huge.

12:34.337 --> 12:38.957
And it had, like, a claw mark at the end.

12:45.538 --> 12:50.518
- What do you want to do?
- I said, let's go.

12:54.942 --> 12:59.045
For someone who's always been in the
woods and saw the woods as my friend,

12:59.046 --> 13:03.666
suddenly these woods became a threat to me.

13:10.491 --> 13:14.260
Having tracked all of the animals
that had ever lived in that area,

13:14.261 --> 13:17.630
I knew for sure I had never seen
these kind of tracks before.

13:17.631 --> 13:20.676
We were looking at something
here walking on two feet.

13:20.677 --> 13:24.517
The tracks were obvious with us.

13:27.619 --> 13:29.484
It's thick brush.

13:29.485 --> 13:31.744
And there's trees, sure,
but there's thick brush.

13:31.745 --> 13:34.865
You can't see more than three
or four feet ahead of you,

13:34.866 --> 13:38.646
and this was a concern for us.

13:40.020 --> 13:45.305
We could hear each other going through the
brush, but how do we know who that is?

13:45.306 --> 13:48.264
It could be me. It could be him.

13:48.265 --> 13:51.985
Or it could be something else.

13:58.872 --> 14:01.092
It's me!

14:02.176 --> 14:04.270
And when we would stop,
we would stop to listen.

14:04.271 --> 14:05.630
It's very important to listen.

14:05.631 --> 14:08.271
[Birds chirping]

14:09.283 --> 14:13.111
We couldn't hear anything
other than chirping birds,

14:13.112 --> 14:16.856
little rustle of leaves through the wind.

14:16.857 --> 14:21.297
There wasn't anything that was unnatural.

14:26.734 --> 14:28.401
We followed the tracks.

14:28.402 --> 14:34.102
And this went on all through
the morning, some two miles.

14:37.845 --> 14:42.221
The anticipation grows, and you
have a tendency to go faster,

14:42.222 --> 14:46.419
because you want to see what's there.

14:46.420 --> 14:49.222
It's like the breath of the hunt...
You can feel it.

14:49.223 --> 14:52.643
It's pumping. It's there.

15:10.744 --> 15:13.144
[Twig snaps]

15:13.313 --> 15:18.173
My heart's pounding like
this, pow, pow, pow.

15:18.352 --> 15:22.955
There was a sense of fear but
mainly a sense of anticipation

15:22.956 --> 15:26.692
of the finality of the
event, the encounter.

15:26.693 --> 15:30.113
What are we going to see?

15:46.346 --> 15:49.282
Some creatures are smart.
They know you're tracking them.

15:49.283 --> 15:51.250
And what they will do,
they'll lead you out so far,

15:51.251 --> 15:54.266
and they'll double back, and
they end up behind you.

15:54.267 --> 15:58.257
While you're following them,
they're following you.

15:58.258 --> 15:59.826
[Bird cawing]

[Rapid fluttering]

16:28.534 --> 16:31.354
[Branches snapping]

16:47.174 --> 16:49.809
We came out into a clearing.

16:49.810 --> 16:54.180
And as we did, we stopped, both of us.

16:54.181 --> 17:00.081
We could plainly see from our vantage
point at the edge of the woods.

17:02.422 --> 17:08.321
The cabin was about 15, 18 feet wide
by about 20 feet, very small dwelling.

17:11.330 --> 17:15.050
We could still see the tracks.

17:19.406 --> 17:22.208
And the tracks led...

17:22.209 --> 17:25.628
Straight to the back door.

17:27.446 --> 17:29.248
The door was shut.

17:29.249 --> 17:31.117
We were dumbfounded.

17:31.118 --> 17:36.155
Animals don't open and
shut doors on their own.

17:36.156 --> 17:40.182
Whatever was in the woods with
us was now in that house.

17:40.183 --> 17:41.412
[Pounding]

17:41.413 --> 17:42.210
Come on out.

17:42.211 --> 17:44.136
Dennis started to beat on
the side of the house.

17:44.137 --> 17:46.299
Hello! [Pounding]

17:46.300 --> 17:47.934
Come out. We know you're in there.

17:47.935 --> 17:49.268
Come on. Come out!

17:49.269 --> 17:51.204
My fear was, we got guns.

17:51.205 --> 17:54.311
We're at this house. We can't do this.

17:54.312 --> 18:00.012
Finally after a few choice
words, he agrees to walk away.

18:05.819 --> 18:08.020
We walk out to the road.

18:08.021 --> 18:09.889
I didn't want to walk down
the road with the guns,

18:09.890 --> 18:14.750
so I gave my dad a call to come pick us up.

18:17.631 --> 18:19.973
What are you guys doing with the guns?

18:19.974 --> 18:21.924
And I told him what had happened.

18:21.925 --> 18:24.516
And he paused a moment, and he said...

18:24.517 --> 18:27.373
I think I know who lives up there.

18:27.374 --> 18:30.296
I think it's the old guy, he
works down at the tire store.

18:30.297 --> 18:32.845
He's lived there for decades.

18:32.846 --> 18:34.981
No one knows anything about him.

18:34.982 --> 18:38.346
I thought, well, that's odd.

18:38.347 --> 18:43.122
There was this old guy that lived there,
yet there was something that wasn't human

18:43.123 --> 18:45.157
that I tracked to his back door.

18:45.158 --> 18:49.718
And I couldn't make those two pieces fit.

18:54.401 --> 18:56.801
[Horn honks]

18:57.604 --> 19:03.484
The next week, Dennis showed
up, and he's got an old tire.

19:04.578 --> 19:08.191
He said, we're gonna get
a look at this guy.

19:08.192 --> 19:09.194
Hello, boys.

19:09.195 --> 19:10.632
The manager came out and
said, can I help you?

19:10.633 --> 19:15.413
I said, yeah, we'd like
to get the tire fixed.

19:15.414 --> 19:19.254
He just rolled the tire through.

19:19.826 --> 19:22.228
George! Tire!

19:22.229 --> 19:26.065
So at that point, we knew his name.

19:26.066 --> 19:29.462
We couldn't wait for the guy to
come out and look at the tire

19:29.463 --> 19:33.183
to get a view of who he was.

19:56.231 --> 19:58.800
It was shadowy.

19:58.801 --> 20:04.338
He come out of those shadows,
and he was lanky, you know?

20:04.339 --> 20:07.279
He was about 6'5...

20:07.463 --> 20:10.730
Very rangy, very long arms.

20:10.731 --> 20:15.683
As soon as he grabbed the
tire, he looked right at us.

20:15.684 --> 20:17.700
We had this...

20:17.701 --> 20:20.641
Immediate connection.

20:20.889 --> 20:23.637
At that moment, we knew, this is the guy.

20:23.638 --> 20:25.918
It's him.

20:27.062 --> 20:29.866
But one of the most amazing
things was his eyes.

20:29.867 --> 20:33.034
They were a very vivid gold.

20:33.035 --> 20:34.402
And they were intense.

20:34.403 --> 20:37.305
Wham! He had a hold of you.

20:37.306 --> 20:43.206
It was almost like a trance like thing.
For a split second, you're like...

20:43.479 --> 20:47.648
He knew that we were the
ones who tracked him.

20:47.649 --> 20:53.289
We're trying to see him, but
he's back in the shadows.

20:53.789 --> 20:57.329
Okay, boys, that'll be $10.

20:57.593 --> 21:01.313
- Oh, thank you.
- No problem.

21:06.702 --> 21:07.935
We heard the tire pop.

21:07.936 --> 21:10.216
[Loud pop]

21:10.632 --> 21:13.632
Everything got quiet.

21:24.052 --> 21:27.655
He's not gonna let us look at him again.

21:27.656 --> 21:31.125
It's like you've tracked
an animal, he's there,

21:31.126 --> 21:35.506
but he's gonna avoid you at all costs.

21:36.798 --> 21:38.799
The manager rolled the tire out.

21:38.800 --> 21:40.301
There we go, boys. Good as new.

21:40.302 --> 21:42.385
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

21:42.386 --> 21:45.225
And he put it in the truck for us.

21:45.226 --> 21:47.708
See you again soon.

21:47.709 --> 21:49.343
We looked down, and we saw...

21:49.344 --> 21:51.864
Look at this.

21:52.714 --> 21:56.551
There were markings in chalk
around the side of the tire.

21:56.552 --> 22:02.089
There was a series of symbols
that was nothing familiar to us.

22:02.090 --> 22:04.225
It was like he was trying
to tell us something,

22:04.226 --> 22:08.413
but we... Of course, we didn't know what.

22:08.414 --> 22:12.535
The mystery was deepening ever more,
because we had made contact with the guy.

22:12.536 --> 22:15.297
He knew us. We knew him.

22:15.298 --> 22:18.238
Now what do we do?

22:20.622 --> 22:23.237
If I called the police...

22:23.238 --> 22:25.983
There was no proof of
anything except that I,

22:25.984 --> 22:29.685
had chosen to track somebody
to their house with a gun.

22:29.686 --> 22:34.546
Which wouldn't make me
look particularly good.

22:34.723 --> 22:37.692
I hesitated about telling my
wife about this whole thing.

22:37.693 --> 22:42.704
I thought, my God, if I tell her this,
I'm gonna have to move right away.

22:42.705 --> 22:46.767
And I didn't really have
the financial resources.

22:46.768 --> 22:50.135
I was trying to keep her safe,
so I told her I said, you know...

22:50.136 --> 22:54.875
It might be a good idea when I'm not
here, maybe call your sister over.

22:54.876 --> 22:57.645
He was clearly getting worried that...

22:57.646 --> 23:00.248
Now he thought someone was out there.

23:00.249 --> 23:03.284
I was fearful of my life.
I was fearful for Raven.

23:03.285 --> 23:04.952
I was scared for Keith also.

23:04.953 --> 23:07.955
Even though he's a big man, I was scared.

23:07.956 --> 23:10.691
It became an issue of functioning.

23:10.692 --> 23:16.592
Could I feel safe in leaving my family
there knowing what I knew at that point?

23:23.602 --> 23:29.502
My friend Dennis called me, and he
said, hey, we're going for a ride.

23:34.416 --> 23:39.287
We pulled up in the lane where
old George's cabin was.

23:39.288 --> 23:40.553
I know where you're going.

23:40.554 --> 23:41.856
I said, we're not doing this.

23:41.857 --> 23:43.958
He said, no. He said, he died.

23:43.959 --> 23:45.727
George died.

23:45.728 --> 23:46.928
Are you sure?

23:46.929 --> 23:51.729
Yeah, my dad heard it
on the police scanner.

23:58.540 --> 24:00.141
[Tapping]

24:00.142 --> 24:03.077
There was a deputy Sheriff's car
there, and it was a guy we knew.

24:03.078 --> 24:04.612
- How you doing, man?
- Good, how are you?

24:04.613 --> 24:06.896
So, uh, what's going on down there?

24:06.897 --> 24:10.977
He said, you guys got to see this.

24:15.606 --> 24:19.409
We couldn't wait to get in there,
because we had obviously, for a while,

24:19.410 --> 24:23.850
wanted to see who or what was in there.

24:32.823 --> 24:35.583
We looked around.

24:37.628 --> 24:41.529
There was no personal items.
There was no food.

24:41.530 --> 24:45.190
There was no clothes, nothing.

24:46.267 --> 24:50.640
This place told us nothing
about whoever lived there.

24:50.641 --> 24:54.844
It was a disappointment yet
a source of curiosity.

24:54.845 --> 24:58.226
But then the deputy said,
look, you got to see this.

24:58.227 --> 25:01.287
Have a look at this.

25:01.626 --> 25:06.179
There was an immediate pungent
smell that hit us in the face.

25:06.180 --> 25:08.881
It smelled like wet dogs.

25:08.882 --> 25:11.702
It's unmistakable.

25:12.124 --> 25:18.024
It was a little bit dark, so my
eyes had to adjust to the light.

25:18.163 --> 25:23.383
The walls were completely
covered with plate steel...

25:24.703 --> 25:29.729
Held together by metal strips
with rivets through it.

25:29.730 --> 25:35.070
The Sheriff's deputy pointed
and said, look at this.

25:36.915 --> 25:40.515
A ten-foot strand of chain...

25:47.287 --> 25:53.167
For whatever reason.
There was something restrained back here.

25:54.066 --> 25:55.878
But who was here?

25:55.879 --> 25:58.459
What was here?

26:09.281 --> 26:15.181
But then the deputy shined a light
on, and everywhere, on the walls...

26:15.754 --> 26:18.754
There were scratches.

26:21.426 --> 26:23.427
Some had rusted over.

26:23.428 --> 26:25.162
Others looked fresher.

26:25.163 --> 26:30.803
But you could tell they had
been made at different eras.

26:35.373 --> 26:39.343
As we stood there, all of us.
Nobody's saying nothing.

26:39.344 --> 26:45.104
The cop was looking at us, we
were looking at each other.

26:49.821 --> 26:55.401
And everybody knew that one
word that was in that room.

26:57.242 --> 27:00.144
I didn't want to say that word.

27:00.145 --> 27:03.985
But all of us were thinking it.

27:09.922 --> 27:12.082
Werewolf.

27:15.561 --> 27:19.641
Could it be? But that's impossible.

27:54.854 --> 28:00.494
My family has lived in this
area for a couple centuries.

28:00.860 --> 28:04.963
My son Dave and his wife, Kim, after
they'd been married for a while,

28:04.964 --> 28:09.164
they decided to move back to Raleigh.

28:10.303 --> 28:12.149
It was a great time.

28:12.150 --> 28:16.875
We were always busy,
always something going on.

28:16.876 --> 28:20.245
We had adopted a new son, Jackson.

28:20.246 --> 28:22.494
He was two and a half years old.

28:22.495 --> 28:26.432
And now having a young
child around this house,

28:26.433 --> 28:30.933
was really an exciting and wonderful time.

28:31.524 --> 28:35.861
It's really great having your
grandchildren grow up around you.

28:35.862 --> 28:39.702
And it was really a happy time.

28:41.200 --> 28:45.100
In the backyard is an old house.

28:45.838 --> 28:49.493
My Aunt lived there until recently.

28:49.494 --> 28:55.394
It was the first time it's been empty
since it was built 200 years ago.

28:57.583 --> 28:59.551
I decided one day that I was gonna go

28:59.552 --> 29:03.422
and clean some things,
move some things around.

29:03.423 --> 29:06.663
Do a little tidying up.

29:27.513 --> 29:33.413
It was just dark, and it seemed
like a completely different place.

29:35.288 --> 29:40.448
It was, uh, just a different
atmosphere altogether.

29:43.296 --> 29:47.556
Went to the kitchen and started first.

29:49.135 --> 29:52.915
Had to move some things around.

30:02.248 --> 30:07.648
I took my sister's cane,
set it over in the corner.

30:14.694 --> 30:16.161
[Loud clatter]

30:16.162 --> 30:21.262
I heard the sound of the
cane hitting the floor.

30:26.441 --> 30:30.161
And I couldn't understand why.

30:31.477 --> 30:35.737
So I moved it over to another corner.

30:48.127 --> 30:50.707
[Cane clatters]

30:51.397 --> 30:55.597
There was another, more violent sound.

30:57.003 --> 31:00.860
And it was almost to the
center of the room...

31:00.861 --> 31:04.581
Like it had been thrown there.

31:19.892 --> 31:25.412
Later that week, I was doing
some work in my workshop.

31:29.869 --> 31:34.489
I was putting a magnet on the mailbox lid.

31:39.912 --> 31:44.959
I finished part of it, and I had
to leave it kind of unfinished

31:44.960 --> 31:49.580
for the next weekend when I had more time.

31:55.290 --> 32:00.930
When I went back, I noticed
that the magnet was missing.

32:07.282 --> 32:10.522
The workshop was locked.

32:12.293 --> 32:16.679
There's no way anyone could just, you
know, go over there and open up.

32:16.680 --> 32:19.440
Later that week...

32:20.038 --> 32:24.238
I was out in the yard cutting grass.

32:26.557 --> 32:29.497
[Lawn mower humming]

32:33.831 --> 32:36.831
[Lawn mower grinding]

32:43.761 --> 32:47.241
I bent down, and I stared.

32:47.844 --> 32:51.684
And there, laying in the grass...

32:53.664 --> 32:55.372
Was the little magnet.

32:55.373 --> 32:59.633
I didn't understand how it got there.

33:05.559 --> 33:10.899
My son Dave asked me to
come back out in the yard.

33:11.842 --> 33:14.602
Look, over there.

33:27.691 --> 33:32.131
It was a procession of different things...

33:32.629 --> 33:36.699
Different items out of
the garage in the yard.

33:36.700 --> 33:41.370
Always between the old farmhouse
in the back and my house.

33:41.371 --> 33:44.251
Could be a trophy.

33:46.576 --> 33:52.476
I thought that it might have been
somebody playing a prank or something.

33:53.250 --> 33:59.150
I was scared to the point I wanted to find
out what it was and who was doing it.

34:18.118 --> 34:20.818
It was Saturday.

34:20.954 --> 34:26.234
We were out on the front
porch doing some planting.

34:34.201 --> 34:36.781
[Music blaring]

34:39.739 --> 34:42.679
The stereo come on.

34:44.645 --> 34:48.879
It starts playing by itself.
I mean, nobody was in there to turn it on.

34:48.880 --> 34:53.686
Kim and I looked at each other, you
know, like, what in the world is that?

34:53.687 --> 34:55.021
Stay there.

34:55.022 --> 34:57.362
Stay there.

34:58.926 --> 35:03.930
Made sure the doors on the back of the
house were still locked, and they were.

35:03.931 --> 35:06.511
[Music blaring]

35:08.702 --> 35:11.522
It was very loud.

[Music stops]

35:24.574 --> 35:26.974

<i>Crawled into my sleeping bag
one night in the Amazon.</i>

35:38.332 --> 35:40.166
I could come up with no explanation for it.

35:40.167 --> 35:43.587
[Indistinct speech over tv]

35:44.271 --> 35:47.751
What caused it to turn on?

36:00.320 --> 36:03.200
It was frightening.

36:03.290 --> 36:06.926
Now something like that was
going on inside of the house.

36:06.927 --> 36:11.847
Something could potentially
happen to my family.

36:11.932 --> 36:14.692
I was downstairs.

36:18.071 --> 36:20.006
[Wood creaking]

36:20.007 --> 36:25.907
And I heard what I thought was
somebody upstairs in the house.

36:29.216 --> 36:31.976
[Electronic chime]

36:43.096 --> 36:46.576
I got up out of my chair.

36:51.305 --> 36:54.965
I walked out into the foyer...

37:08.222 --> 37:12.062
To the front door of the house.

37:19.867 --> 37:25.037
Looking through the pickets
was a little redheaded girl.

37:25.038 --> 37:28.578
She was just looking at me.

37:32.679 --> 37:35.259
I go upstairs.

37:36.416 --> 37:38.017
I couldn't see her.

37:38.018 --> 37:40.520
There was nobody there.

37:40.521 --> 37:44.061
It was like she faded away.

37:52.232 --> 37:56.432
After that, I sat in Jackson's room.

38:01.012 --> 38:06.323
I was worried about him and
his family, their safety.

38:06.324 --> 38:11.304
There was definitely
something inside that house.

38:17.190 --> 38:19.392
It was late afternoon.

38:19.393 --> 38:22.093
[Thunder booming]

38:23.096 --> 38:26.232
I started hearing thunder.

38:26.233 --> 38:29.397
I could tell a storm was coming our way.

38:29.398 --> 38:35.038
So I got up to look out of
the door to see the storm.

38:44.785 --> 38:49.765
And I saw a girl standing
there staring at me.

38:52.359 --> 38:54.219
Hey!

38:55.429 --> 38:57.129
Hey!

38:57.130 --> 39:00.610

Hey!

She disappeared around the
corner of the old farmhouse.

what I'm seeing is there...

But...

40:09.837 --> 40:12.117
It's not.

The little girl seemed to be coming
from out of the old farmhouse.

40:26.509 --> 40:30.889
I do not venture back there very often.

40:32.559 --> 40:35.319
But I went back.

I was trying to find out who she was.

40:50.908 --> 40:53.368
[Fly buzzing]

of my grandfather's sisters.

Lula and Petronia.

41:07.124 --> 41:09.082
Petronia...

41:09.083 --> 41:13.103
Born in 1877 at the old farmhouse.

41:13.376 --> 41:17.633
And she died at the old farmhouse in 1920.

41:17.634 --> 41:20.754
And she had red hair.

41:24.722 --> 41:27.677
She had a very difficult life.

41:27.678 --> 41:33.578
By the time she was a teenager,
she was almost totally blind.

41:37.654 --> 41:42.169
We believe that she has
re-manifested herself as a child.

41:42.170 --> 41:45.561
Because it was the
happiest time of her life.

41:45.562 --> 41:49.165
She could see. She could run and play.

42:01.879 --> 42:05.600
that the little redheaded
child was my Aunt Petronia.

42:05.601 --> 42:08.722
It's sort of almost a
happy thing, actually,
