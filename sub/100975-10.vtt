WEBVTT

00:13.930 --> 00:14.973
It's gorgeous around here.

00:15.056 --> 00:16.224
[Jonathan] Is there cable cars?

00:16.307 --> 00:18.309
-[Karamo] Yeah, cable car bus system.
-I love that.

00:18.810 --> 00:20.311
[Karamo] This is West Philadelphia,

00:20.395 --> 00:22.772
which is a working class,
historically black neighborhood.

00:22.856 --> 00:25.859
I mean, there's just so much life
and history over here.

00:25.942 --> 00:26.985
-[Jonathan] Yeah.
-[Karamo] You just gotta love it.

00:27.068 --> 00:29.821
People see older black neighborhoods
and they think, like, all of a sudden,

00:29.904 --> 00:32.073
it's dangerous. And there's
so much love in this community.

00:32.157 --> 00:34.242
We're always intimidated
by what we don't know.

00:34.325 --> 00:35.869
Better preach, Antoni.

00:35.952 --> 00:37.620
Let me tell you something,
the art around here--

00:37.704 --> 00:39.414
[Jonathan] The murals are incredible.

00:39.497 --> 00:41.666
The <i>murials</i> are so beautiful.

00:41.750 --> 00:43.209
-The "murals"?
-The "murals."

00:43.293 --> 00:44.586
-You could say "mural."
-Murals.

00:44.669 --> 00:46.337
-Murals.
-M-murals.

00:46.421 --> 00:49.382
-[Karamo] Murals.
-[laughing]

00:49.466 --> 00:51.634
[theme music playing]

00:51.718 --> 00:55.847
<i>-♪ Better ♪</i>
<i>-♪ All things just keep getting better ♪</i>

01:02.228 --> 01:05.565
Ladies, would you like to know
why I put you in workout clothes today?

01:05.648 --> 01:07.734
-Yes! I love athleisure.
-Yeah!

01:07.817 --> 01:12.072
It's because our hero this week
is a personal trainer and a gym owner!

01:13.490 --> 01:15.366
Are we gonna work on
my knockout punch today?

01:15.450 --> 01:16.284
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah.

01:17.952 --> 01:18.995
[panting]

01:19.079 --> 01:22.707
His name is Nate McIntyre.
He's 44 years old.

01:22.791 --> 01:24.125
I wonder if he's related to Reba.

01:24.209 --> 01:27.670
I doubt it, because he's black
and lives in West Philadelphia.

01:27.754 --> 01:30.090
-[laughing]
-Then no.

01:30.173 --> 01:31.966
Well, listen, he is 6'4".

01:32.050 --> 01:34.052
-Ooh!
-I know. Big, tall drink of water,

01:34.135 --> 01:35.595
-Johnny would say.
-Yes.

01:35.678 --> 01:37.680
-Stay out of his nook, Johnny.
-Why, bitch?

01:37.764 --> 01:39.265
[laughing]

01:39.349 --> 01:40.600
[Jonathan] I'll let him tell me that.

01:40.683 --> 01:42.185
[laughing]

01:42.519 --> 01:45.605
[Karamo] He moved to Philadelphia
to attend Villanova University

01:45.688 --> 01:46.981
on a football scholarship

01:47.065 --> 01:48.775
and has never left since.

01:48.858 --> 01:51.361
He opened Bodyrock Gym 12 years ago.

01:53.238 --> 01:55.615
It's a '90s-inspired hip-hop boot camp.

01:55.698 --> 01:56.616
Love that!

01:56.699 --> 02:00.245
[Nate] You can call it hood mentality,
you can call it old school hip-hop.

02:00.328 --> 02:02.372
You can call it punk DIY.

02:02.455 --> 02:04.332
Let's go. Come on, ladies, let's go.

02:04.415 --> 02:09.003
It started off just me and a couple
of people out in the middle of a park.

02:09.087 --> 02:12.590
And I've just kind of been bootstrapping
my way to where I am now.

02:12.674 --> 02:14.676
Fifteen left, 15 right!

02:15.218 --> 02:17.679
Nate was nominated
by his ex-girlfriend Kristin

02:17.762 --> 02:19.889
and his clients Lauren and Aileen.

02:19.973 --> 02:22.892
I mean, I'm a hard person to train,
I think, because I hate working out.

02:22.976 --> 02:24.727
But he made it so fun for me.

02:25.103 --> 02:27.230
He's strict, but he also

02:27.313 --> 02:28.648
welcomes you with open arms.

02:28.731 --> 02:29.732
-What's up?
-Hey.

02:29.816 --> 02:32.402
All right, step on up to your tire.

02:32.485 --> 02:36.447
I just really fell in love with how much
care he gives to the people he trains.

02:36.531 --> 02:37.866
Catch you on this one right here.

02:37.949 --> 02:39.492
He has a successful studio in that

02:39.576 --> 02:43.204
he has people that come here
that really love him and are loyal.

02:43.288 --> 02:44.414
I cheated. [laughs]

02:44.789 --> 02:48.334
But Nate doesn't have his act together.

02:48.418 --> 02:52.297
Yeah. I mean, he just hasn't updated it
since he moved in.

02:52.380 --> 02:53.840
Like, things are broken...

02:54.507 --> 02:55.633
or falling apart.

02:56.926 --> 02:59.304
The last time it was cleaned
was probably, like,

03:00.013 --> 03:02.599
three years ago to, like,
throw his birthday party in that space,

03:02.682 --> 03:04.517
and I had to wear, like, a dust mask

03:04.601 --> 03:07.687
and, like, scrub, like,
grime off of the walls.

03:07.770 --> 03:08.855
Oh!

03:09.355 --> 03:12.150
Due to necessity, I live in my gym.

03:12.525 --> 03:15.778
He doesn't have
any self-care routine whatsoever.

03:15.862 --> 03:17.280
I have a black mother,

03:17.363 --> 03:19.365
and she would not be very happy
with the fact

03:19.449 --> 03:21.242
that I walk around ashy.

03:21.326 --> 03:25.205
Do I want to say that?
No, I shouldn't say that. [laughs]

03:25.830 --> 03:29.250
[Karamo] Nate wears the same worn-out,
dirty gym outfit daily.

03:29.334 --> 03:30.668
-Phenomenal.
-[laughing]

03:30.752 --> 03:32.378
That's what I was hoping you'd say.

03:32.462 --> 03:35.048
Tuck the front of his shirt in.
He'll be fine.

03:35.131 --> 03:36.424
[laughing]

03:36.507 --> 03:39.719
I just think he doesn't feel good enough
about himself

03:39.802 --> 03:42.013
to keep up with his appearance.

03:42.096 --> 03:44.474
[Karamo]
Nate grew dreadlocks in the mid 1990s,

03:44.557 --> 03:47.185
and he covers them up
with a head wrap every day.

03:47.268 --> 03:49.812
-Oh.
-[Kristin] He won't take the do-rag off.

03:49.896 --> 03:53.107
He, like, sleeps with it, like,
when we were still sleeping together.

03:53.191 --> 03:54.901
If it fell off in the middle of the night,

03:54.984 --> 03:55.818
he would like... [gasps]

03:56.486 --> 03:57.862
pull it back on.

03:57.946 --> 04:01.991
Like, how can we be in a relationship
with one another if I can't even see

04:02.617 --> 04:03.701
your full self?

04:03.785 --> 04:04.953
[Karamo] When it comes to relationships,

04:05.036 --> 04:07.538
instead of trying to work on it,
he just calls it quits.

04:07.622 --> 04:08.915
-Hmm.
-Heard that before.

04:08.998 --> 04:09.999
He broke up with Kristin one year ago
to, quote-unquote, "work on himself."

04:10.083 --> 04:12.794
but aren't you gonna push yourself
through the uncomfortable moments?

04:12.877 --> 04:13.711
Yes.

04:13.795 --> 04:18.675
He broke up with Kristin one year ago
to, quote-unquote "work on himself."

04:18.758 --> 04:21.678
[Kristin] The work that he wanted to do
is financial.

04:21.761 --> 04:23.930
I think he had a certain vision
of where his dad was at,

04:24.013 --> 04:25.723
like, when he married his mom,

04:25.807 --> 04:28.768
and I think there is a certain way
that he compared himself to his dad,

04:28.851 --> 04:32.230
and I think the expectations
that he was putting on himself

04:32.313 --> 04:36.317
got in the way of him loving himself
and loving me.

04:36.901 --> 04:40.446
My main focus is getting things going
inside of my gym.

04:40.530 --> 04:45.243
You know, it's a little frightening.
Things are changing at such a rapid pace.

04:45.326 --> 04:47.453
All of a sudden you look up and you wonder

04:47.537 --> 04:49.414
how you got priced out
of your own neighborhood.

04:49.497 --> 04:52.542
Nate's worried that the gym can't compete
with the big businesses

04:52.625 --> 04:53.751
that are popping up.

04:53.835 --> 04:55.086
It's a super-valid concern.

04:55.670 --> 04:59.716
I want him to be able to be himself
and have that reflect in the gym.

04:59.799 --> 05:03.720
The only thing getting in the way of him
living the life he wants to be living

05:03.803 --> 05:04.637
is himself.

05:04.721 --> 05:08.057
Our mission this week is to give
this trainer a brand-new program.

05:08.141 --> 05:09.350
-Yes!
-Yes!

05:10.351 --> 05:13.563
-One, two, three, count it out.
-[women] One!

05:13.646 --> 05:16.357
-One, two,three. What number?
-[women] Two!

05:16.441 --> 05:18.026
-Did we just pass it?
-I don't know.

05:18.109 --> 05:20.111
-No, that's not it.
-Is this it?

05:20.194 --> 05:21.988
Let's go, let's go, let's go, come on!

05:22.071 --> 05:22.947
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

05:23.031 --> 05:25.908
That's not it.
It's kind of hard to find this place.

05:25.992 --> 05:27.577
There it is. I think it's right here.

05:27.660 --> 05:30.121
-There you go.
-There it is! There it is! Found it!

05:31.039 --> 05:32.623
-Come on, kids. Come on.
-[Karamo] Let's go.

05:32.707 --> 05:35.126
One, two, three.

05:35.209 --> 05:39.630
-[Tan] Oh, my, oh, my! Hello, how are you?
-[cheering]

05:40.715 --> 05:42.759
[laughing]

05:43.384 --> 05:45.636
[Tan] We're just gonna join you.
What are we doing?

05:45.720 --> 05:47.930
Okay, girls, let's show 'em what we got!

05:48.014 --> 05:50.558
One, two, three!

05:50.641 --> 05:51.476
[women] One!

05:51.559 --> 05:54.604
-One, two, three!
-[women] Two!

05:54.687 --> 05:58.358
-[Nate] One, two, three!
-[laughing]

05:58.816 --> 06:01.486
[Karamo] Hey! You're all sweaty.

06:01.569 --> 06:04.113
-No, no, let's bring it in.
-[shouts] I can't! I can't!

06:04.197 --> 06:07.825
I can't! [shouts]

06:07.909 --> 06:09.577
Hi, nice to meet you.

06:09.660 --> 06:13.748
-Hi, Aileen and Lauren, how are you?
-Hi! Nate is amazing.

06:13.831 --> 06:16.793
We've been dedicated to him
for 15 and ten years.

06:16.876 --> 06:17.919
-[Jonathan] Okay, commitment.
-[laughing]

06:18.002 --> 06:20.546
He will kick your behind.

06:20.630 --> 06:21.798
That's a great trainer!

06:21.881 --> 06:24.217
And he makes you feel good
from the inside.

06:24.300 --> 06:25.718
[man] Aww!

06:25.802 --> 06:27.762
-[Karamo] Don't have him hug you.
-Aww.

06:27.845 --> 06:30.556
Class, you all are dismissed.
Get some water.

06:30.640 --> 06:33.434
-Good class. Give it up. Whoo!
-[cheering]

06:33.518 --> 06:34.852
-Thank you!
-Bye.

06:34.936 --> 06:36.145
[woman] Take good care of him.

06:36.229 --> 06:38.523
-Is this really happening right now?
-[Jonathan] It is!

06:39.107 --> 06:42.360
I want you to tell us about your gym
and make us excited for it.

06:42.443 --> 06:45.405
Let's talk about what a client experiences
when they come in here.

06:45.488 --> 06:48.491
You come in, I usually put you through--
I can put you through what we do.

06:48.574 --> 06:49.992
-No, no, no.
-We're okay.

06:50.076 --> 06:51.661
-We ain't got time for that.
-We're okay.

06:51.744 --> 06:55.248
Do you use these machines in classes
or personal training?

06:55.331 --> 06:57.792
[Nate]
Honestly, I don't ever use those machines.

06:57.875 --> 07:00.461
I put them in here just so
people could know that it was a gym.

07:00.545 --> 07:02.505
-Put a sign that says "gym."
-We're gonna keep going.

07:02.588 --> 07:05.091
[laughing]

07:05.174 --> 07:06.926
-[Karamo] We want to see the space.
-[Bobby] Show us things.

07:07.009 --> 07:09.137
-[Tan] Show us!
-[Karamo] What is going on?

07:09.512 --> 07:10.346
What?

07:10.430 --> 07:12.140
-[Antoni] Wow!
-What?

07:12.223 --> 07:14.976
-What the--
-[Jonathan] Oh, my God!

07:15.059 --> 07:18.729
All right, so my living space, I'd say,
is kind of like my Achilles heel.

07:18.813 --> 07:20.565
Like, it bleeds into the gym,

07:20.648 --> 07:22.316
and then, like,
I can't bring people back here.

07:22.400 --> 07:25.403
-Achilles heel is, like, a hidden issue.
-[Nate] Uh-huh.

07:25.528 --> 07:27.405
Honey, this is, like, our glaring--

07:27.488 --> 07:29.866
That's what this is for.
You didn't notice.

07:31.742 --> 07:32.702
All right, so, this is...

07:32.785 --> 07:36.914
-[Bobby] Nate. Da... [bleeps]
-[laughing]

07:36.998 --> 07:40.168
Right now Nate "lives" in the gym,
but there's really nowhere to live.

07:40.251 --> 07:41.377
The bedroom's full of stuff.

07:41.461 --> 07:42.545
Not comfortable.

07:42.628 --> 07:45.506
Downstairs in his "living" area,
it's full of crap.

07:46.799 --> 07:48.092
It's gross.

07:48.176 --> 07:50.428
Nate, do you do black sheets
so you don't have to wash 'em?

07:51.053 --> 07:52.472
[Karamo]
Y'all better be lucky I'm not Bobby Berk,

07:52.555 --> 07:55.266
'cause I'd come here and Marie Kondo
the hell out of this place.

07:55.349 --> 07:57.351
I can't handle it.
I'm gonna have to pass out.

07:57.435 --> 07:58.686
Does this bring you joy?

07:58.769 --> 07:59.937
I know it doesn't. Bye.

08:00.021 --> 08:02.690
Does this bring you joy?
I know it doesn't. Good day.

08:02.982 --> 08:04.275
Trust and believe.

08:05.067 --> 08:08.488
Wu-Tang?
This was the joint, are you kidding me?

08:08.571 --> 08:09.906
This, however, was never my joint.

08:09.989 --> 08:12.742
-[laughing]
-You even do "'90s porn"?

08:12.825 --> 08:14.076
-'90s porn!
-[laughs]

08:14.785 --> 08:17.914
Uh, okay, our company bathroom.

08:17.997 --> 08:21.125
[grunting]

08:21.209 --> 08:24.128
[Antoni] Isn't it kind of crazy, though,
that his customers have to change in here?

08:24.212 --> 08:26.130
The work starts now, honey.

08:26.214 --> 08:29.175
It's just a jimble-jamble
of all this stuff all over the bathroom,

08:29.258 --> 08:31.719
and he's got his Waterpik
right all up in there

08:31.844 --> 08:34.639
with everyone's sharticles flying all up
in the air.

08:34.805 --> 08:37.266
And no. No!

08:38.351 --> 08:40.269
No! [scoffs]

08:40.353 --> 08:43.773
No, you bring your knees in.

08:43.856 --> 08:45.942
[Antoni] There's, like,
hairs that are stuck to the wall.

08:46.025 --> 08:46.943
This is outrageous.

08:47.026 --> 08:48.986
This is like one simple brush
against the panel.

08:49.070 --> 08:53.115
-[wincing]
-Lift your bum. You suck at this!

08:55.618 --> 08:56.494
What the... []bleeps] ?

08:57.954 --> 08:58.829
Oh!

09:03.251 --> 09:04.710
Ugh!

09:07.338 --> 09:08.839
Oh, my God!

09:08.923 --> 09:11.801
I've never seen this before.
There is full-on mold.

09:11.884 --> 09:12.802
[Tan] On the rice.

09:13.302 --> 09:17.306
-No, why would you sniff that?
-[shouts]

09:17.431 --> 09:19.767
It smells like old spinach.

09:20.142 --> 09:22.728
[Jonathan] This is, like, your bathroom,
and this is our business bathroom,

09:22.812 --> 09:24.272
so double situation, which I love.

09:24.772 --> 09:26.899
I think what is important, though,
is, like, boundaries.

09:26.983 --> 09:29.527
There's no boundaries
between church and state...

09:29.610 --> 09:31.904
-Yeah.
-...between myself and my clients.

09:31.988 --> 09:33.489
Funny you should talk
about church and state,

09:33.573 --> 09:37.034
because we're actually having an erosion
of that separation in this country anyway.

09:37.118 --> 09:38.995
-[laughing]
-You're getting political.

09:39.078 --> 09:40.746
Tell me about...

09:40.830 --> 09:42.498
-Oh, no.
-What is going on

09:42.582 --> 09:46.085
underneath our gorgeous head wrap?
I know that we are living for head wraps.

09:46.168 --> 09:48.838
I started getting blotches of hair
that were falling out.

09:48.921 --> 09:50.172
-Can I see?
-[sighs]

09:50.256 --> 09:51.674
-And do you want to see?
-Yeah, I do.

09:52.508 --> 09:54.844
[Nate] My goodness.
I can't believe I'm taking it off.

09:55.303 --> 09:57.680
-All right, so...
-Okay, let me see the back.

09:58.764 --> 10:00.641
Okay. I'm curious about,

10:00.725 --> 10:05.396
like, what it is about the locks that
we're insisting about carrying with us?

10:05.479 --> 10:07.732
Well, my dreadlocks were a big part

10:07.815 --> 10:11.360
of just, kind of, how I identified myself
when I was younger.

10:11.444 --> 10:14.780
I don't feel happy about the situation
that's going on over here.

10:14.864 --> 10:17.074
We don't need to make any decisions.
I'm already really proud of you

10:17.158 --> 10:20.369
for taking your head wrap off
and showing me your beautiful hair.

10:20.453 --> 10:23.122
I prefer to come, like, as real

10:23.205 --> 10:25.499
-and as authentic as possible.
-I love that.

10:27.418 --> 10:29.170
Oh, my God.

10:29.253 --> 10:32.965
It's like when Han Solo gets stuck
in that, like, cast resin thing.

10:33.049 --> 10:36.093
That is those jars in Nate's freezer.

10:37.261 --> 10:39.347
Oh, yeah, that can go, too.

10:39.430 --> 10:41.098
Nobody needs that.

10:41.182 --> 10:43.309
Oh, yeah, that color's a crime.

10:43.392 --> 10:44.852
[Jonathan]
Wait, what is this gorgeous moment?

10:44.935 --> 10:46.812
This is Macy Gray's album.

10:46.896 --> 10:48.147
And it's for him.

10:48.230 --> 10:50.024
[Jonathan] Maybe he's a producer.

10:50.608 --> 10:53.944
Nate, you've got money here
you've never cashed.

10:54.028 --> 10:56.739
Your fridge is kind of empty,
and your freezer is full.

10:57.198 --> 10:59.992
-There's some expired items in there.
-[laughs] No.

11:00.076 --> 11:02.620
When's the last time that you prepared
a whole meal in your own kitchen?

11:02.703 --> 11:05.790
I do eat inside of here,
but it's the whole convenience thing.

11:05.873 --> 11:08.793
I have to say the cleanest thing
in this whole room...

11:08.918 --> 11:10.628
-[Nate] Is what?
-...is that wall plaque

11:10.711 --> 11:12.004
with Macy Gray's album.

11:12.088 --> 11:13.047
And why is your name on it?

11:13.381 --> 11:14.715
My sister is Macy Gray.

11:15.966 --> 11:16.967
Um...

11:17.385 --> 11:20.304
There's a point where I used to travel
on the road with her

11:20.388 --> 11:22.890
until I decided I couldn't do it anymore.

11:22.973 --> 11:23.849
Do you sing also?

11:23.933 --> 11:25.351
-I do sing, yes.
-[Tan] You do?

11:25.434 --> 11:27.895
-Wait, what? This is a plot twist.
-[Nate] Yeah.

11:27.978 --> 11:30.815
The personality you see now
changes completely.

11:30.898 --> 11:32.316
Yeah, KillerWhale's fun. It's...

11:32.400 --> 11:33.317
KillerWhale?

11:33.401 --> 11:36.028
-Yeah. That's what we go by on stage.
-Oh.

11:36.112 --> 11:37.363
-Okay.
-[Antoni] I like that.

11:37.738 --> 11:39.490
Okay, come with me, let's take a look

11:39.573 --> 11:41.409
-at your closet, dear.
-[Antoni] Tan, please be gentle.

11:41.492 --> 11:44.662
You actually have a closet,
but you've got all of this.

11:45.121 --> 11:47.331
-It's a lot of stuff in there.
-It's a lot, mate.

11:47.915 --> 11:49.458
What are you wearing on a date?

11:49.542 --> 11:50.751
What would I do on a date?

11:50.835 --> 11:53.879
Well, tell me what you'd do on a date
and then I wanna know what you'd wear.

11:53.963 --> 11:57.800
I like a restaurant, like,
but not, like, too fancy of a restaurant.

11:58.217 --> 11:59.093
I love salsa.

11:59.719 --> 12:01.137
You dance salsa?

12:01.220 --> 12:03.180
I dance falsa. I dance fake salsa.

12:03.264 --> 12:04.348
Can you show me?

12:04.849 --> 12:06.308
You just kind of, you know, work it.

12:06.392 --> 12:10.187
-[laughs] Oh! Oh!
-Put your hand up, then turn around.

12:10.271 --> 12:14.734
Oh, nice. All right. You twirl, too!
All right. I like that.

12:15.234 --> 12:17.570
He's a sexy man.

12:17.653 --> 12:19.613
I feel like I could make
a T-shirt look fly.

12:19.697 --> 12:21.282
-Trying to look more crisp.
-Yeah.

12:21.365 --> 12:23.200
It's not necessarily
where I feel the most comfortable.

12:23.284 --> 12:24.618
But now I'm 44 years old,

12:24.702 --> 12:26.662
so I don't want to get into this stuff,

12:26.746 --> 12:28.581
-but I'm not tied to anything here.
-Yeah.

12:28.664 --> 12:30.541
Do you feel like you have to look
a certain way

12:30.624 --> 12:31.792
because you've hit a certain age?

12:32.209 --> 12:34.295
I feel like there's pressure to look,

12:34.378 --> 12:35.755
-act, behave a certain way.
-Yeah.

12:35.838 --> 12:37.089
I just want to look fly.

12:37.173 --> 12:41.385
Well, maybe there's a way of balancing fly
and a more appropriately dressed Nate.

12:41.469 --> 12:43.345
That doesn't mean you're getting rid
of your essence.

12:43.429 --> 12:45.890
That's what we're gonna do. We're gonna
focus on you and get to the place

12:45.973 --> 12:48.184
that makes you feel more confident,

12:48.267 --> 12:51.896
because I know that
this is not your story.

12:54.356 --> 12:57.526
[Karamo] How did you envision this place
being once you got it?

12:58.027 --> 12:59.195
[Nate] This was, like,

12:59.278 --> 13:02.990
my opportunity to create
the Philadelphia that I wanted to see.

13:03.073 --> 13:06.827
You know, people of all races, colors,
creeds inside of space, like,

13:06.911 --> 13:10.664
for them to feel comfortable inside
of the world of fitness.

13:10.748 --> 13:12.583
I expected it to,

13:12.666 --> 13:16.921
you know, provide for me
and be able to provide for others.

13:17.004 --> 13:18.589
The first of many gyms.

13:18.672 --> 13:22.760
And, you know, I look up,
and all of a sudden I'm 44 years old.

13:22.843 --> 13:24.804
And then now I'm like, "Wait a minute.

13:25.429 --> 13:28.849
If I'm gonna go and accomplish this stuff,
you know,

13:28.933 --> 13:31.185
it should have happened ten years ago."

13:31.268 --> 13:34.647
And not having a person to really
bounce that kind of stuff off of,

13:34.730 --> 13:36.357
it can be difficult.

13:36.440 --> 13:39.568
Has there ever been anyone that
you felt like you could talk to about

13:39.652 --> 13:40.736
what was going on in your mind?

13:40.820 --> 13:43.781
My last girlfriend Kristin,
she's probably, you know,

13:44.490 --> 13:46.575
the person who's dug the deepest.

13:46.659 --> 13:49.870
This sounds to me like
life overwhelmed you.

13:49.954 --> 13:52.331
Yeah. It's definitely frustrating.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.752
I know we came in here like a force,

13:56.836 --> 13:59.213
but we are here to support you 100%

13:59.296 --> 14:02.049
in you feeling comfortable,
in you getting what you need.

14:02.132 --> 14:03.509
-I'm ready to do it.
-Yeah?

14:03.592 --> 14:05.636
Yeah. No, you gotta have a little bit
more excitement than that.

14:05.719 --> 14:08.681
Are you ready? You're a trainer.
Are you ready to get this week started?

14:08.764 --> 14:11.725
-Let's go, let's do this!
-[Karamo] There we go!

14:11.809 --> 14:14.103
-Shirts off!
-[laughing]

14:14.186 --> 14:15.229
One, two, three, Bodyrock.

14:15.312 --> 14:16.689
Three, two, one.

14:16.772 --> 14:18.023
[all] Bodyrock!

14:18.107 --> 14:20.150
-We're lunging out.
-Come on, we can lunge out.

14:20.234 --> 14:21.277
[Jonathan] Add a pulse at the bottom.

14:21.610 --> 14:23.070
-[Karamo] We got it. Torso.
-[Antoni] Pulse it out.

14:23.153 --> 14:23.988
-[Jonathan] Go!
-[Bobby] Tight.

14:30.619 --> 14:33.956
I want Nate to keep
the cool neighborhood vibe that he has,

14:34.331 --> 14:36.250
but as his neighborhood evolves,

14:36.333 --> 14:39.253
his business needs to be able to grow
to stay there.

14:39.837 --> 14:41.672
Hair moving south or moving away,

14:41.755 --> 14:43.173
it's a tough subject,

14:43.257 --> 14:46.927
but I want to show him there can be
a different way for him to be confident

14:47.011 --> 14:48.304
about the way that he looks.

14:48.387 --> 14:50.848
Let's embrace the beauty
of what we get to be now.

14:52.099 --> 14:54.685
Nate has so many clothes in his closet,

14:54.768 --> 14:57.646
but none of them represent
the person he wants to be.

14:57.730 --> 15:00.065
If you're encouraging people
to live their best lives,

15:00.149 --> 15:01.942
I want to feel that from you also.

15:02.610 --> 15:05.154
Nate knows exactly what he needs
to be doing.

15:05.237 --> 15:07.281
He knows that he needs
to be eating better.

15:07.364 --> 15:09.867
He wants this for himself,
but he's not doing it.

15:09.950 --> 15:11.118
Why isn't he doing it?

15:11.201 --> 15:12.661
I want to find out.

15:13.537 --> 15:17.333
He's not satisfied with where he is
in his life or the success of the gym.

15:17.708 --> 15:18.834
I want to show him,

15:18.918 --> 15:20.294
"Your best days aren't behind you.

15:20.377 --> 15:21.629
They're still in front of you."

15:21.712 --> 15:26.008
<i>♪ Yeah, gonna take my time</i>
<i>Gonna take my time ♪</i>

15:26.634 --> 15:29.053
[pop music playing]

15:37.269 --> 15:38.562
So, this is West Philly.

15:38.646 --> 15:40.439
-[Nate] Yeah, we're on Baltimore Avenue.
-Okay.

15:40.522 --> 15:45.069
It runs all the way from the suburbs into
areas that are, you know, changing a lot.

15:45.152 --> 15:46.987
There's, like, gentrification going on.

15:47.071 --> 15:48.489
[laughs] That's the word for the day.

15:48.572 --> 15:49.865
What's your perception of that?

15:49.949 --> 15:52.117
Is it a positive thing, a negative thing?

15:52.201 --> 15:54.620
I mean, I like neighborhoods that have

15:54.703 --> 15:57.957
people who are invested
in maintaining them.

15:58.040 --> 16:02.252
It makes you fall in love with being part
of something that's bigger than just you.

16:02.670 --> 16:04.129
Have you been to Booker's?

16:04.213 --> 16:05.255
I have been to Booker's.

16:05.339 --> 16:06.298
Yeah, this is good food.

16:06.382 --> 16:07.591
-[Antoni] Okay. After you.
-Great.

16:07.675 --> 16:08.968
-Hello.
-Hi, Saba.

16:09.051 --> 16:10.970
-Hi, guys, how are you?
-[Antoni] Good.

16:11.053 --> 16:13.472
-This is Nate.
-Hi, Nate. Nice to meet you. Welcome.

16:13.555 --> 16:17.518
There are local businesses that are
thriving by staying true to themselves,

16:17.601 --> 16:19.770
but also supporting
their respective communities.

16:20.521 --> 16:22.439
-Saba, can we use your kitchen, please?
-Yes, please.

16:22.523 --> 16:24.858
-Okay, awesome. Thank you so much.
-Thank you.

16:27.444 --> 16:29.029
-You like Mediterranean food?
-I do.

16:29.113 --> 16:31.365
-I like how clean it is.
-Yes!

16:31.448 --> 16:34.159
But I also like to keep it simple,
because we don't have time, we're busy.

16:34.243 --> 16:35.661
We're running businesses, right?

16:35.744 --> 16:37.788
We're gonna do a nice little reveal.

16:39.331 --> 16:41.542
This is a red snapper,
and we're gonna whole roast it,

16:41.625 --> 16:43.794
and I'm gonna show you,
like, how simple it is to do.

16:43.877 --> 16:44.753
I need easy.

16:44.837 --> 16:47.798
Nate's philosophy in the gym
is back to basics.

16:47.881 --> 16:49.341
I'm gonna apply that to food.

16:49.842 --> 16:52.469
We're gonna start with a red onion
and just slice through it.

16:52.553 --> 16:53.387
There you go.

16:53.470 --> 16:54.680
When's the last time you cooked?

16:55.639 --> 16:58.017
-I have no idea.
-[laughs]

16:58.100 --> 17:00.185
So now we have our onions.
We're just gonna grab a handful.

17:01.353 --> 17:04.314
Lift the fishy by the tail
and put it underneath.

17:04.398 --> 17:06.692
-All the flavors from the fish and fat...
-Oh, right.

17:06.775 --> 17:08.861
All those juices
are gonna come pouring down.

17:08.944 --> 17:10.487
And then a bit of Greek olive oil.

17:10.571 --> 17:12.322
That's gonna get them
really nice and crispy.

17:12.406 --> 17:15.409
-It's gonna help them brown afterwards.
-This is right up my alley.

17:15.492 --> 17:17.202
-So now the cavity's been cleaned out.
-Okay.

17:17.286 --> 17:18.996
[Antoni] So all we have is the inside.

17:19.079 --> 17:21.665
-[Nate] See, this is so simple.
-Right? Awesome.

17:21.749 --> 17:24.501
We're gonna make three incisions,
to the bone. I wouldn't cut through it.

17:24.585 --> 17:27.463
What's nice here is that we get
to flavor the inside of it.

17:27.546 --> 17:29.506
-I see.
-And it's also gonna look super cute

17:29.590 --> 17:30.758
when it comes out of the oven.

17:30.841 --> 17:33.260
-This'll knock some socks off right here.
-Right?

17:33.343 --> 17:37.014
And then a little bit of salt and pepper
on top because seasoning is everything.

17:37.931 --> 17:39.016
Into the oven.

17:39.099 --> 17:41.185
These puppies are gonna roast
side by side,

17:41.268 --> 17:43.687
and we'll check on them
in about 30, 35 minutes.

17:43.771 --> 17:45.481
-You like cooking!
-I do like cooking.

17:45.564 --> 17:48.317
Eating this way is
the way I would prefer to eat,

17:48.400 --> 17:49.860
but I don't get to do that

17:49.943 --> 17:52.613
in the situation that I'm in right now,
the way I live.

17:52.696 --> 17:54.865
-I see a lot of willingness.
-Yeah.

17:54.948 --> 17:57.659
You have all of these infomercial relics

17:57.743 --> 18:00.913
of all these awesome cooking tools
in your kitchen.

18:00.996 --> 18:02.915
But in your freezer, you have, like,

18:02.998 --> 18:05.125
20 pork chops that were
all purchased at the same time,

18:05.209 --> 18:06.335
and then they all got frozen.

18:06.418 --> 18:07.294
What happens?

18:08.253 --> 18:11.173
It's like having pistons moving
at the same time.

18:11.632 --> 18:15.761
Like, if you have one that's working
and the other three aren't working,

18:15.844 --> 18:18.764
eventually the one that's working
is gonna stop working.

18:18.847 --> 18:22.142
When one thing is off, it makes it easier
for other things to be off.

18:22.226 --> 18:23.811
-For sure.
-My food's off, my diet's off.

18:23.894 --> 18:25.979
My energy level is affected.

18:26.480 --> 18:28.524
Sentiment turns to sediment.

18:29.024 --> 18:31.193
Nate's biggest struggle is follow-through.

18:31.276 --> 18:33.862
He has all of these fantastic ideas,

18:33.946 --> 18:37.616
but he doesn't know how to continue
with them once they get started.

18:37.699 --> 18:39.785
He needs to learn how to keep it simple.

18:40.160 --> 18:42.746
I fear letting myself down,

18:42.830 --> 18:45.124
giving up on some of my dreams,

18:45.207 --> 18:47.084
-my overall big mission.
-Right.

18:47.167 --> 18:49.503
You know,
if I'm not taking care of myself,

18:49.586 --> 18:52.089
then everything else, you know,
falls to the wayside.

18:52.172 --> 18:53.048
But how do you feel?

18:53.715 --> 18:55.134
I feel like it's now or never.

18:55.217 --> 18:59.805
The one thing that Nate has follow-through
in his life right now is fitness.

18:59.888 --> 19:03.308
It's about Nate presenting himself
like that in every facet of his life.

19:04.268 --> 19:06.728
-We're ready for this fish.
-I'm hyped about this.

19:07.771 --> 19:09.565
It's like in between
my complexion and yours.

19:09.648 --> 19:11.400
Weirdly, it's like our fish baby.

19:11.483 --> 19:14.069
That is a weird expression
I never thought I would say.

19:14.695 --> 19:16.321
It doesn't get easier than that.

19:16.905 --> 19:18.115
Okay, let's try it now.

19:18.198 --> 19:20.325
[chattering]

19:22.202 --> 19:23.078
That is banging.

19:23.162 --> 19:24.371
Whoo, mama!

19:24.454 --> 19:25.414
Isn't that nice?

19:25.497 --> 19:28.375
-We killed it.
-We did kill it! We did.

19:28.876 --> 19:30.460
[Bobby] I smell yumminess.

19:30.544 --> 19:31.378
How's it going?

19:31.461 --> 19:33.005
-Want a little piece of fishy?
-Yes, please.

19:33.922 --> 19:35.591
-There you go.
-Mmm!

19:36.049 --> 19:37.801
-[Antoni] All right.
-I'm eating light and energetic.

19:37.885 --> 19:40.262
-I'm ready to go. Whoo!
-[Antoni] Right? That's what we want.

19:40.345 --> 19:41.430
-[Antoni] Bye.
-[Bobby] Bye, baby.

19:41.513 --> 19:42.598
-This way.
-[Antoni] Go off with Bobby.

19:42.681 --> 19:44.433
-I'll see you guys later.
-[Bobby] Bye.

19:44.516 --> 19:46.518
[pop music playing]

19:52.691 --> 19:54.610
[Nate]
Are we going to the gym or somewhere else?

19:54.693 --> 19:57.362
Just sit back, just live in it.

19:57.529 --> 19:59.406
-[Nate] I think I know where we're going.
-[laughs]

19:59.531 --> 20:02.451
You guys got me yesterday.
I was totally off-guard.

20:02.534 --> 20:05.537
-[laughs] Good.
-Teaching my class, doing my thing.

20:06.038 --> 20:10.083
[laughs] Next thing you know, I'm getting
bum-rushed by these five dudes.

20:11.126 --> 20:12.419
God, this city is so pretty.

20:12.502 --> 20:14.630
[Nate] Yeah, it's got history to it.

20:16.006 --> 20:17.174
The architecture is...

20:17.257 --> 20:19.593
like, my neighborhood, you have a mix
of so many different people.

20:19.676 --> 20:21.094
You got people from the 'hood,

20:21.178 --> 20:23.013
you got college students, business people.

20:23.096 --> 20:26.475
So many different types of people all
in one small area.

20:26.558 --> 20:27.517
It's a community.

20:28.352 --> 20:29.811
[Bobby]
What was it like when you first opened?

20:29.895 --> 20:34.441
Um, just like, you know,
you have a newborn baby, you know.

20:34.733 --> 20:37.069
I was very detailed with everything.

20:37.152 --> 20:39.529
And I think that disarray started
to happen

20:39.613 --> 20:41.698
when I was like, "Am I gonna make rent?"

20:42.449 --> 20:44.618
So you're a little worried
about gentrification.

20:45.118 --> 20:47.579
Your neighborhood changing,
rent's going up,

20:47.663 --> 20:49.289
other gyms coming in. Yeah?

20:49.790 --> 20:53.877
I'm not opposed to investing
into a neighborhood

20:53.961 --> 20:55.921
to make that neighborhood better,

20:56.004 --> 20:58.465
but I'm opposed to the idea of,
all of a sudden,

20:58.548 --> 21:01.301
you know, the mom-and-pop turned
into this boutique

21:01.385 --> 21:02.844
that nobody can afford anymore.

21:08.141 --> 21:11.895
How does Bodyrock survive gentrification?

21:11.979 --> 21:14.106
That's always a thing
that I'm thinking about, you know,

21:14.189 --> 21:17.609
without having, like, a proper education
when it comes to business and marketing.

21:17.985 --> 21:21.738
I can really, truly, honestly say
I have been there.

21:21.822 --> 21:23.365
I dropped out of high school at 15,

21:23.448 --> 21:24.825
no education at all.

21:24.908 --> 21:27.452
I mean, I used to live in my car.
I've been homeless.

21:27.536 --> 21:28.704
This is a nice car to live in.

21:29.079 --> 21:30.539
[laughs] No, it was not this car.

21:30.622 --> 21:34.042
And now I have a furniture brand that's
in stores all over the world.

21:34.126 --> 21:37.504
[Nate] So how did you take your business
from small to scaled up?

21:37.921 --> 21:39.589
You build consistencies in your brand.

21:39.673 --> 21:42.843
What would you say the first step
you took towards...

21:44.052 --> 21:45.554
finding that consistency?

21:45.637 --> 21:48.056
I would say, with me,
there were visual standards

21:48.140 --> 21:51.143
that set the brand apart
from other furniture stores.

21:51.601 --> 21:53.145
You said to me yesterday,

21:53.228 --> 21:55.147
you know, "I'm gritty, that's my thing.

21:55.230 --> 21:57.024
I don't want to be those other gyms."

21:57.107 --> 21:58.400
I don't want you to, either.

21:58.734 --> 22:00.027
'Cause what you are,

22:00.110 --> 22:02.321
that's what sets you apart,
and that's what your clients love.

22:02.404 --> 22:05.657
And so I want to show you some examples
of that.

22:05.741 --> 22:09.119
Nate could still have
a cool neighborhood gym

22:09.202 --> 22:14.333
that stays true to his philosophies,
but also appeals to a wider audience.

22:14.416 --> 22:16.543
This is the world famous boxer
Danny Garcia's place.

22:16.626 --> 22:18.670
-[Nate] Oh, okay.
-It's got barber shop,

22:18.754 --> 22:21.298
body shop, clothing store and a gym.

22:21.381 --> 22:23.592
The gym is ultimately what I want
to show you.

22:24.676 --> 22:27.637
[man] Here is where the dream came true.

22:29.473 --> 22:30.432
Nice.

22:30.515 --> 22:32.559
This was the first thing that opened
in the compound.

22:33.352 --> 22:36.730
Danny, he loves the sport,
and the community loves him.

22:36.813 --> 22:39.316
So he decided, well, why not open his own?

22:39.399 --> 22:43.445
You know, when you in somebody else's gym,
you gotta follow other people's rules.

22:43.528 --> 22:45.906
So he's like, "Listen,
we're gonna make our own rules here."

22:46.490 --> 22:49.201
[Nate] I think it's cool that
everything has its own place.

22:49.284 --> 22:51.078
Everything is organized.

22:51.161 --> 22:53.455
-This is not like any corporate gym.
-No, not at all.

22:53.538 --> 22:55.540
But it's inviting, still,
'cause it's clean.

22:55.624 --> 22:59.086
Your focus is what you're doing here.
Your focus is not the space.

22:59.169 --> 23:01.671
You can still be unique,

23:01.755 --> 23:04.383
but still have something
that you can duplicate as well

23:04.466 --> 23:06.426
-if you ever expand.
-Absolutely.

23:06.510 --> 23:11.390
It's cool to see something that's for
the community, for his people, our people.

23:11.473 --> 23:13.392
He needs to move onward and upward.

23:13.475 --> 23:15.936
Come on! Yeah, yeah! Come on, Nate!

-Good to see you, buddy.

Nate, this is Andrew.

23:38.375 --> 23:39.918
-Andrew owns this store.
-Nice to meet you.

23:40.001 --> 23:42.003
We are gonna help ourselves to your store.

23:42.087 --> 23:43.171
-All right, thank you.
-[Tan] Cheers, buddy.

23:43.255 --> 23:46.633
Not only is Nate a gym owner,
he's a creative guy.

23:47.092 --> 23:49.302
That's not what he has
in his closet right now.

23:49.386 --> 23:53.306
You had said that you want to be fly
and funky, fresh.

23:53.390 --> 23:55.058
You said that you are a musician.

23:55.142 --> 23:57.269
You have your band, KillerWhale.

23:57.352 --> 23:59.646
Well, when I'm in my band,
that's a lot easier for me,

23:59.729 --> 24:01.648
to like, you know, swag,

24:01.731 --> 24:05.152
funky, you know,

24:05.986 --> 24:10.574

and Rick James' cornrows.

24:10.657 --> 24:12.409
-Oh, my!
-[both laugh]

24:12.492 --> 24:14.703
Maybe we need to get a bit of KillerWhale

24:14.786 --> 24:17.456
-and incorporate that into your closet.
-Yeah.

24:17.539 --> 24:20.333
Do you feel fly when you're working out
at the gym in your gym clothes?

24:20.417 --> 24:21.543
It's not cool, actually.

24:21.626 --> 24:24.254
Your word is "fly."
It's not fly what you're wearing.

24:24.337 --> 24:26.631
-Like, all of it should be fly, Nate.
-Yeah.

24:26.715 --> 24:27.966
All right. Should we shop?

24:28.049 --> 24:29.968
-[laughs] Yeah, let's do it.
-Okay.

24:30.051 --> 24:31.219
So, layering.

24:31.803 --> 24:34.139
Start with something simple.
Go with a pair of jeans.

24:34.222 --> 24:38.018
Grab a T-shirt, but get a jacket
with a layer that's more dressed up.

24:38.101 --> 24:41.646
Something like that. And then,
go for a boot, and you've got your look.

24:41.730 --> 24:42.731
Okay.

24:42.814 --> 24:44.441
[Tan] I'm gonna get you to go around.

24:44.524 --> 24:45.775
-[Nate] I'm gonna do this myself?
-You are.

24:46.359 --> 24:47.903
-Okay.
-These are hot.

24:48.528 --> 24:50.363
-I like those a lot.
-Good, me, too.

24:50.447 --> 24:51.990

24:52.073 --> 24:55.243
It feels fly.
Can I just continue to use your word

24:55.327 --> 24:57.454
even though it's definitely not
within my normal vernacular?

24:58.246 --> 25:00.457
-Yes. That's it, I love that.
-[laughs]

25:02.709 --> 25:03.543

25:03.627 --> 25:04.628
-Yeah.
-How we doing?

25:04.711 --> 25:05.921
-We ready?
-I'm ready.

25:06.004 --> 25:08.757
I mean, this works for me.

25:10.759 --> 25:13.136
I love the jeans. I love the jacket.

25:13.553 --> 25:14.888
I don't know about this shirt.

25:14.971 --> 25:17.557
Easy fix. Does it feel authentic?

25:17.641 --> 25:21.186
Yeah, I like the way it's made more
to my shape.

25:21.269 --> 25:22.103
Yeah, so,

25:22.687 --> 25:26.733
I would like you to give me
just a little bit of KillerWhale.

so it still feels fly.

26:02.435 --> 26:04.771
I gave you a sneaker so it's more you,

26:04.854 --> 26:07.315

because it's more formal.

What was it like there for you?
What brought you to Villanova?

27:16.551 --> 27:18.720
Well, coming from where I was in Ohio,

27:18.803 --> 27:22.515
I lived kind of, like, in the country,
and I wanted to get out.

27:22.599 --> 27:25.143
Football allowed me the opportunity
to come to this school.

27:25.560 --> 27:26.770
However, my dad...

27:27.771 --> 27:30.482
he wanted me to go to a military academy.

27:30.565 --> 27:32.359
Actually, he was a drill sergeant
in the military,

27:32.442 --> 27:35.612
and there was points in our relationship
where we battled.

27:35.695 --> 27:39.115
He thought I was, you know, lazy

27:39.199 --> 27:41.493
and hard-headed,
you know, and in some ways,

27:41.576 --> 27:42.952
yes, that's true.

27:43.036 --> 27:44.788
We hear our parents or people saying,

27:44.871 --> 27:46.873
in the beginning of our lives,
certain things.

27:46.956 --> 27:48.833

27:49.417 --> 27:52.671
Well, see, the thing is that you're not
lazy, nor are you hard-headed.

-I see that, yeah.

27:55.256 --> 27:57.676
You gotta start to break the cycle
with that.

I was gonna take over the world

28:07.977 --> 28:08.812
But...

28:09.312 --> 28:11.314

then you start to...

28:12.107 --> 28:13.858

28:14.317 --> 28:15.944

to fight against that.

28:22.367 --> 28:24.327
these expectations
that you're holding onto,

he could conquer everything.

-Weights.

28:46.558 --> 28:49.769
The weights. Where'd you get these from?
These are from my gym.

28:51.479 --> 28:53.314

28:53.732 --> 28:55.483
These first weights that are heavy on you

28:55.567 --> 28:57.527

28:57.610 --> 28:59.320

to be there for you, to support you,

on your own.

29:15.712 --> 29:17.380
Yeah, I just don't know how
to ask for help,

29:17.464 --> 29:19.257

what that even looks like.

you gotta handle it on your own,"

is supposed to look like.

You can have your dreams.
That's what makes you great.

30:24.948 --> 30:26.991
That's why you have people who keep coming
to your gym

because they see your dream.

30:29.953 --> 30:31.037

30:31.538 --> 30:33.498
But the more you put
on these expectations,

the more it's messing
with your confidence.

I'm not gonna lie. I need a change.
I need to switch that up.

31:57.999 --> 32:00.168
I'm not happy with hiding myself.

32:00.585 --> 32:03.004
You know, I think hair loss
can cause a lot of shame,

32:03.087 --> 32:04.547
and men don't know how
to talk about, like,

32:04.631 --> 32:07.383
beauty-related
or cosmetic-related issues as much.

32:07.467 --> 32:10.011

to be ashamed of

32:10.094 --> 32:11.304
or to be embarrassed about.

32:11.387 --> 32:12.805
And you're actually being very brave.

So this is our gorgeous
little baby dream team.

32:27.278 --> 32:30.657

and it's okay to take that leap of faith

32:30.740 --> 32:33.618

Indiana Jones, honey, and take that jump.

if you're not comfortable

32:41.084 --> 32:45.088

now could be the time to change it.

from feeling more beautiful,

32:47.423 --> 32:48.841
this isn't what you need right now.

more of your beautiful face.

32:53.096 --> 32:54.138

32:54.222 --> 32:56.099
Sometimes when a person
cuts off their locks,

32:56.182 --> 32:58.309
it can be a little challenging.

32:58.393 --> 32:59.602

-[Karamo] It looks nice in here.

36:39.697 --> 36:40.781
-No more covering it up.
-[Tan] I love it.

36:40.865 --> 36:42.158
[Bobby] You know what I love?

36:42.241 --> 36:45.786
Making sure that when you have a small
space, you have a lot of nice, clean,

36:45.870 --> 36:49.665
vertical lines, so doing a cabinet door
with drawers inside...

36:49.749 --> 36:51.959
-[Antoni] Ooh!
-makes your kitchen look cleaner.

36:52.043 --> 36:53.628
This is a game changer for me.

36:53.711 --> 36:58.633
More than anything, being able to actually
prepare a meal will change my entire life.

36:59.091 --> 37:00.468
I'm, like, really excited.

37:00.551 --> 37:02.845
I can invite someone over
to dinner, lunch.

37:02.929 --> 37:04.555
I'd love to invite Kristin over.

37:04.639 --> 37:07.225
-She's given me plenty of meals in my day.
-[Jonathan] Aww!

37:07.308 --> 37:10.353
She could look at you longingly
as you're cooking for her.

37:10.436 --> 37:11.938
-Like, give you the doe eyes.
-[laughs] Like that?

37:13.981 --> 37:15.942
What-what? Whoa!

37:16.025 --> 37:17.985
-[Bobby laughs]
-[Nate] What?

37:18.527 --> 37:20.863
Oh, that's cool. [laughs]

37:20.947 --> 37:23.366
-[Bobby] Got more drawers down here.
-[Tan] Ooh, I love storage.

37:23.783 --> 37:25.701
-Oh, please, yes!
-When you don't have a big room,

37:25.785 --> 37:28.120
you wanna make sure that you're utilizing
all your real estate.

37:28.204 --> 37:30.539
Wait a minute, this is so fly.

37:32.041 --> 37:34.543
[Bobby] One more thing. Let's go up
to your new check-in desk.

37:34.627 --> 37:36.754
So I created you a new website with Wix.

37:36.837 --> 37:40.007
They're really cool because it allows you
to manage your business from here.

37:40.091 --> 37:42.718
-So it's not just a pretty website.
-This is awesome.

37:42.802 --> 37:44.887
People can now go online and schedule.

37:44.971 --> 37:47.139
So you're able to focus on your clients

37:47.223 --> 37:49.016
-and not so much on the back office.
-Yeah.

37:49.100 --> 37:51.769
People can come and they can see
exactly what I do,

37:51.852 --> 37:52.812
how to get involved.

37:52.895 --> 37:54.313
There's no excuses anymore.

37:54.397 --> 37:56.857
Thank you, man.
This is exactly what I needed.

37:59.277 --> 38:01.404
[Karamo] You have been so brave

38:01.487 --> 38:04.156
-and courageous this entire week.
-Right.

38:04.448 --> 38:06.617
I've been trying to figure out
on my own...

38:07.702 --> 38:09.787
how to accept help,

38:09.870 --> 38:13.958
how to get back to my original,
just, like, energy,

38:14.041 --> 38:18.504
and that doesn't involve me carrying
any preconceived notions about myself.

38:18.587 --> 38:23.134
I mean, I deserve to have a gym
that's thriving.

38:23.217 --> 38:27.221
I deserve to be able to come home
and be relaxed inside of my space.

38:27.305 --> 38:28.264
You do deserve that.

38:28.723 --> 38:30.725
A lot of men, to be very honest with you,

38:30.808 --> 38:33.394
a lot of black men were very much taught,

38:33.477 --> 38:35.813
"You're a provider.
You have to hit certain benchmarks.

38:35.896 --> 38:37.315
This is what a man looks like.

38:37.398 --> 38:39.692
This what a man who does
for his community looks like."

38:39.775 --> 38:42.236
And it's always outward,
what you're doing for them,

38:42.320 --> 38:44.447
and we forget to say to ourselves,

38:44.530 --> 38:45.990
"I also deserve."

38:46.782 --> 38:48.034
And that's all I'm trying
to get you to say.

38:48.117 --> 38:49.660
-Yeah.
-Do you deserve love?

38:50.369 --> 38:51.245
I deserve it, yeah.

38:51.329 --> 38:52.830
And you've also let go of the weight.

38:53.331 --> 38:54.832
-All right.
-Thank you.

38:54.915 --> 38:56.459
Thanks a lot. I appreciate it.

38:56.917 --> 39:00.921
First things first, you had mentioned,
it was a word I'd never heard.

39:01.005 --> 39:03.299
-Booyah nonsense?
-Booyah! Sorry, booyah.

39:03.382 --> 39:05.092
So I wanted to add some...

39:05.176 --> 39:06.427
-Booyah.
-Booyah,

39:06.510 --> 39:08.512
and I want people to walk in
off the street and think,

39:08.596 --> 39:11.557
"He clearly owns this place.
I'm gonna go with that guy."

39:11.640 --> 39:13.684
But I wanna make sure you're on brand
at all times.

39:13.768 --> 39:15.686
So you've got, like,
Bodyrock here on the back.

39:15.770 --> 39:17.730
-[Nate] I love it.
-You've got them on your shorts, too.

39:17.813 --> 39:20.024
[Nate] These are hot.
It's definitely '90s.

39:20.107 --> 39:22.068
-[laughs]
-Yeah. Yeah. Good. Okay, pants.

39:22.151 --> 39:26.113
You don't always have to be in joggers.
You don't always have to be in sweats.

39:26.197 --> 39:27.490
-[Nate] Combination of the two.
-Yeah.

39:27.573 --> 39:30.451
There's a cotton version of it.
They've got elasticated bottoms,

39:30.534 --> 39:33.579
so you're still gonna feel
like you're in a jogger.

39:33.662 --> 39:35.915
-Awesome.
-Yeah, and I got you button-up shirts,

39:36.290 --> 39:38.959
super, super lightweight. Like,
everything is super, super lightweight.

39:39.043 --> 39:41.629
-I can wear this with jogging pants.
-Absolutely, you could.

39:41.712 --> 39:44.715
-Okay, next, you need specs.
-[laughs]

39:45.341 --> 39:46.467
Oh, my goodness.

39:46.926 --> 39:48.761
-That's what a prescription feels like.
-[laughs]

39:48.844 --> 39:50.388
That was the issue all along?

39:50.471 --> 39:53.265
-You couldn't see how much you had?
-[laughs]

39:53.349 --> 39:54.475
You had no idea?

39:54.558 --> 39:56.143
This is what it looked like
all the time, huh?

39:56.227 --> 39:59.355
No, this is very, very different
to how it looked, believe me.

40:00.940 --> 40:03.025
Okay, Nate, come on down.

40:03.442 --> 40:05.111
[Fab 5 cheering]

40:05.194 --> 40:06.112
[Tan] I know!

40:06.195 --> 40:08.781
You look really cute.

40:08.864 --> 40:11.700
-Look at you!
-[Antoni] I love burgundy on you.

40:11.784 --> 40:12.827
Those glasses!

40:13.327 --> 40:15.454
[Tan]
Let's just see you without the hat, too.

40:15.538 --> 40:17.206
You look so cute.

40:17.289 --> 40:20.042
-It's my suit without putting on a suit.
-[Tan] Yeah.

40:20.126 --> 40:21.669
[Nate] I feel light. I feel fresh.

40:21.752 --> 40:24.088
-I'm quick on my feet right now.
-Ooh!

40:24.171 --> 40:26.924
-[Tan] Yes, agile. Standing ovation.
-[Nate laughs]

40:27.007 --> 40:28.509
I appreciate you guys so much.

40:28.592 --> 40:31.887
Honestly, the most important part
of this whole experience for me

40:31.971 --> 40:35.099
and what's going to change my life
more so than anything

40:35.182 --> 40:38.060
is being able to take care of myself

40:38.144 --> 40:40.020
and my health and my wellness.

40:40.104 --> 40:42.606
I'm ready to take this to the next step,

40:42.690 --> 40:45.401
the next level,
and it's the foundational stuff.

40:45.484 --> 40:46.485
It's back to basics.

40:46.569 --> 40:47.945
Feel on top of the world right now.

40:48.028 --> 40:51.323
Good. With that being said,
we're out of here.

40:51.782 --> 40:53.325
[Nate] I might sneak up on you guys.

40:53.409 --> 40:55.411
-[laughing]
-[Tan] Here, group huggies.

40:55.494 --> 40:56.912
[groaning]

40:57.621 --> 40:59.748
[upbeat music playing]

41:15.973 --> 41:16.891
[bell rings]

41:18.726 --> 41:21.353
-[Tan] Ant, what are we making, my love?
-This is a smoothie.

41:21.437 --> 41:23.939
-Ooh!
-[Antoni] Almond milk, bananas,

41:24.023 --> 41:27.067
medjool dates, lime zest
and vegan protein powder.

41:27.151 --> 41:28.736
[Jonathan]
She's giving me vacation, honey.

41:28.819 --> 41:30.571
-So good.
-Yes.

41:30.654 --> 41:31.489
[Antoni] Cheers, guys.

41:31.572 --> 41:32.406
-Love.
-[Bobby] Yeah.

41:32.490 --> 41:35.784
I want to see this gym
after Nate was in there by himself.

41:35.868 --> 41:37.119
-Should we do this?
-Yeah!

41:37.203 --> 41:39.497
[Antoni] You're such a good boy, Walter.

41:40.956 --> 41:41.832
Guys, you ready?

41:41.916 --> 41:42.917
-Yes, always.
-Let's do it.

41:44.376 --> 41:46.837
Look how sharp he looks!

41:46.921 --> 41:48.964
-He looks so handsome!
-[Karamo] Wow, he looks handsome, though.

41:49.465 --> 41:52.426
-Oh, with confidence!
-Looks so good!

41:53.010 --> 41:56.597
[laughs]
Welcome back to the gym. What's up?

41:57.056 --> 41:58.807
-[man] New beginning!
-[Nate] Darling.

41:58.891 --> 42:00.142
[laughing]

42:00.226 --> 42:03.145
He is hugging everybody.
He is gonna be the mayor of West Philly.

42:03.896 --> 42:06.190
-Wow!
-[laughing]

42:07.066 --> 42:09.443
I'm so proud of you, yo, that's dope!

42:09.860 --> 42:12.780
You look like a nice star now.
You look like KillerWhale.

42:12.863 --> 42:15.616
-I look like KillerWhale. [laughs]
-Mm-hmm.

42:16.158 --> 42:18.869
-Oh, my gosh.
-Oh, my gosh, are you kidding me?

42:18.953 --> 42:20.371
Oh, my God, center-part sisters.

42:20.454 --> 42:23.290
Oh, my gosh, it smells good in here!

42:23.374 --> 42:25.251
-Look at this.
-We're using the whole space?

42:25.334 --> 42:27.670
-[Aileen] Wait, look at this logo.
-[Lauren] I love it.

42:29.463 --> 42:31.674
[Lauren] Oh, my gosh! Wait a second!

42:31.757 --> 42:33.008
[Aileen] I can't even believe it.

42:34.385 --> 42:36.220
-I'm in shock.
-[Jonathan] Yes!

42:36.303 --> 42:38.055
He's feeling himself.

42:38.138 --> 42:40.140
[Tan] Why wouldn't he? Look at him.

42:40.224 --> 42:41.725
-Come on, ladies.
-[laughing]

42:41.809 --> 42:43.269
I like Nate a lot.

42:43.352 --> 42:47.064
-This is a beautiful style on you.
-It's a beautiful style on me!

42:47.147 --> 42:48.899
[Lauren]
We always knew you had style, though.

42:48.983 --> 42:50.734
Yes, queen. Yes.

42:50.818 --> 42:52.861
This is awesome. Thank you guys so much.

42:52.945 --> 42:54.238
You're so welcome!

42:54.321 --> 42:55.656
-I'm so happy for you.
-Thank you so much.

42:55.739 --> 42:56.574
So happy for you.

42:56.657 --> 43:00.035
I can't wait to work out here
because it looks amazing.

43:01.745 --> 43:02.871
[woman] Nathon!

43:03.414 --> 43:06.292
Oh, my, look at my son!

43:06.375 --> 43:08.502
-Look how proud she looks.
-[Jonathan] Aww!

43:08.586 --> 43:10.337
Welcome to Bodyrock Boot Camp!

43:10.421 --> 43:12.965
-You look so well-groomed!
-Aww!

43:13.048 --> 43:16.010
I love that look.
But I like that hair off. Yes.

43:16.093 --> 43:19.680
-I love how expressive she is.
-Moms notice every detail.

43:19.763 --> 43:23.642
Oh, this is wonder-- and then there's room
to walk around in here!

43:23.934 --> 43:25.769
I like the look of the gym!

43:26.437 --> 43:28.897
Wait a second.
He has food in his refrigerator.

43:28.981 --> 43:30.190
Hey, but looks so healthy.

43:30.274 --> 43:32.026
-This is the master room?
-Yeah, it's nice.

43:32.109 --> 43:33.944
-[Nate] This is the master bedroom.
-[woman] Open.

43:34.028 --> 43:38.198
-So yeah. I got some competition now.
-[laughs]

43:40.367 --> 43:41.201
-Ooh.
-[Karamo] Oh!

43:41.785 --> 43:44.079
-[Antoni] Oh, Kristin!
-Hello!

43:44.163 --> 43:46.290
-Hi.
-[laughs]

43:46.373 --> 43:48.375
[Kristin] Oh, wow!

43:48.792 --> 43:50.377
This... gold chains.

43:50.461 --> 43:51.378
Excuse me.

43:52.046 --> 43:54.506
-[Nate] Aah.
-Oh!

43:54.590 --> 43:56.592
Look how beautiful you look!

43:56.967 --> 43:58.344
-She still likes him.
-There he is.

43:58.427 --> 44:00.512
-[Antoni] She still likes him.
-[Kristin] Yes.

44:00.596 --> 44:02.765
Mom's over there looking like, "Girl."

44:03.223 --> 44:04.850
-Uh-huh.
-I do clean up nice.

44:04.933 --> 44:06.769
[Kristin] And the front looks amazing.

44:06.852 --> 44:08.520
-Wow!
-[Nate] You wanna see my place?

44:08.604 --> 44:09.772
Yeah, take me to the bedroom.

44:09.855 --> 44:10.773
Oh!

44:10.856 --> 44:11.940
Did I say that out loud?

44:12.024 --> 44:12.900
And I-- oh!

44:13.317 --> 44:16.737
Oh, wow!

44:16.820 --> 44:18.781
Look at this!

44:18.947 --> 44:20.157
She's like, "I can sleep here."

44:20.240 --> 44:22.076
She's like, "I'm about
to move over those speakers, honey.

44:22.159 --> 44:24.453
-Put in my little jewelry box."
-[laughing]

44:25.454 --> 44:27.331
I want to say thank you so much.

44:31.001 --> 44:33.504
-[Kristin laughs]
-You are my best friend,

44:33.587 --> 44:35.381
and I really have appreciated

44:35.464 --> 44:41.053
every single time that you've tried
to break through to the possibilities

44:41.136 --> 44:42.596
that I've always dreamed of,

44:42.680 --> 44:44.973
and I know that I can't do it on my own,

44:45.557 --> 44:47.893
and I want you to be there with me,
so I just...

44:49.144 --> 44:50.062
Yeah, thank you.

44:53.065 --> 44:53.982
[kisses]

44:54.066 --> 44:55.609
-Oh!
-Okay!

44:55.693 --> 44:56.902
Yes!

44:57.277 --> 45:01.699
Allowing people in and asking for help
is not a sign of weakness.

45:01.782 --> 45:04.368
That's accepting that
you cannot do it all alone.

45:04.743 --> 45:07.996
Ask for the love and support
from the people that surround you.

45:08.664 --> 45:11.917
I feel that this experience
has lit a fire underneath me.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.169
I feel like I am in attack mode,

45:14.503 --> 45:16.422
and I'm not retreating.

45:16.505 --> 45:18.507
-Fired up!
-[all] Booyah!

45:18.590 --> 45:20.426
[cheering]

45:21.135 --> 45:23.095
Let's all say booyah!

45:23.178 --> 45:25.055
[all] Booyah!

45:26.098 --> 45:28.142
[Jonathan] He would have been
such a good cheerleader. Oh.

45:28.976 --> 45:29.977
[Nate] Yeah, man.

45:30.686 --> 45:32.062
Wait, what's happening with this, Bobbers?

45:32.146 --> 45:34.273
[Bobby] I really wanted Nate
to make the gym his own,

45:34.356 --> 45:37.025
so I encouraged him
to bring in some graffiti artists

45:37.109 --> 45:39.486
so he really feels like
it's a part of him.

45:39.570 --> 45:42.072
-So he can show his personality.
-That's awesome.

45:48.287 --> 45:50.748
Are you ever worried that
your look is starting to wear you?

45:51.832 --> 45:55.043
I always advise not to make drastic change
on an impulse,
