00:02.077 --> 00:03.828
Previously on "The 4400".

00:10.985 --> 00:14.239
We're not sure what happened.
Something's out there.

00:14.405 --> 00:18.117
The light has gone and
thousands of people have appeared.

00:18.284 --> 00:20.370
Diana Skouris, Tom Baldwin.

00:20.537 --> 00:24.958
You'll be one of the teams investigating
what happened to the returnees.

00:25.124 --> 00:27.794
We're letting them go.

00:27.961 --> 00:29.838
We have no right to hold them.

00:30.004 --> 00:33.424
I'm Warren Lytell.
HomeSec mentioned I was coming.

00:33.591 --> 00:35.426
I'm here to clean up your mess.

00:35.593 --> 00:39.931
There's gonna be a change around here.
Be part of it or get swept aside.

00:40.098 --> 00:45.353
I'll provide a safe haven for any 4400.
You'll be our first residents.

00:45.520 --> 00:48.565
- I'm in love with Richard.
- Why would I break you up?

00:48.731 --> 00:52.110
If you're on the job, I feel safe.
So does the baby.

00:52.277 --> 00:55.572
Two happy residents. That's a start.

00:55.738 --> 00:59.284
Maia Rutledge, aged eight.
Disappeared in '46.

00:59.450 --> 01:03.037
She makes predictions.
Once they come true,

01:03.204 --> 01:06.791
she's removed from quarantine
by one of our field agents.

01:06.958 --> 01:09.627
You can't bring Maia
back to school any more.

01:09.794 --> 01:12.213
We have to consider the other students.

01:12.380 --> 01:13.923
- It'll be OK.
- It's not OK.

01:14.090 --> 01:16.676
Somebody will make everything better.

01:16.843 --> 01:19.429
Next case, Shawn Farrell, aged 17.

01:19.596 --> 01:22.932
Disappeared in April of 2001.
It's a little thin.

01:23.099 --> 01:25.810
Me breaking up with Danny
is not about you.

01:25.977 --> 01:27.895
OK.

01:29.772 --> 01:32.066
I need to ask you a few questions.

01:32.233 --> 01:35.361
I don't know what happened.
I just put my hands on him.

01:35.528 --> 01:36.654
Woke up...

01:36.821 --> 01:39.324
Don't touch me.

01:39.490 --> 01:42.660
I recognise you
but I don't know who you are.

01:42.827 --> 01:45.246
- What are you doing?
- I'm looking.

01:45.413 --> 01:47.582
- For what?
- For me.

01:47.749 --> 01:51.419
I finally understand.
They're not the strangers.

01:51.586 --> 01:53.796
I am.

01:55.381 --> 01:57.967
I'm not Kyle Baldwin.

01:59.000 --> 02:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:11.814 --> 02:13.649
Kyle.

02:14.567 --> 02:17.195
I'm not Kyle.

02:18.196 --> 02:21.574
- Then who are you?
- I don't know.

02:23.826 --> 02:28.456
- I need more screens.
- OK.

02:31.376 --> 02:34.754
Your son is experiencing
a dissociative disorder.

02:34.921 --> 02:37.882
That's common
for newly awakened coma patients.

02:38.049 --> 02:41.511
He feels disconnected
from his personality.

02:41.677 --> 02:46.015
We knew he'd need to adjust
but he doesn't know who he is.

02:46.182 --> 02:50.394
This is frustrating but you did
the right thing bringing him back here.

02:50.561 --> 02:52.271
Yeah.

02:53.231 --> 02:56.359
- So what now?
- We need to do another cranial MRI.

02:56.526 --> 02:59.487
They'll be here in an hour
to take him downstairs.

02:59.654 --> 03:02.323
I know this is difficult, Tom.

03:02.490 --> 03:05.993
But Kyle's come this far.
We can't give up now.

03:07.870 --> 03:10.873
I think I've got the exact change.

03:14.001 --> 03:16.045
Hello, cutie.

03:18.005 --> 03:19.298
Thanks.

03:19.465 --> 03:24.011
- How long have you known that man?
- Tony? About two years.

03:24.178 --> 03:27.723
- He's nice.
- He's very nice.

03:27.890 --> 03:31.394
- Why do you say that?
- He's going to fall in love today.

03:31.561 --> 03:33.729
Tony? My God. Good for him.

03:33.896 --> 03:35.898
- It's not with me, is it?
- Nope.

03:36.065 --> 03:38.693
I didn't think so.

03:47.535 --> 03:49.453
Is there something else, Maia?

03:49.620 --> 03:55.001
- How long am I going to be like this?
- Like what?

03:55.167 --> 03:58.421
I don't want to know things
before they happen.

03:58.588 --> 04:01.674
I want to be normal, like I used to be.

04:03.926 --> 04:06.053
It's gonna be OK, sweetie.

04:06.220 --> 04:09.891
- Besides, who's normal anyway?
- You are.

04:10.057 --> 04:13.269
Huh! You want to know a secret?

04:14.353 --> 04:16.355
Normal people like me...

04:17.481 --> 04:21.402
...they just wish
they were special, like you.

04:21.569 --> 04:23.696
Put the television back on.

04:23.863 --> 04:29.410
Kyle, when you came home you spent
all that time looking through your books.

04:29.577 --> 04:32.997
Then the maps, now the TV.
What are you looking for?

04:33.164 --> 04:35.875
Maybe we can help you look, too.

04:51.599 --> 04:53.643
Come here.

04:56.312 --> 04:59.565
- You should go and get some rest.
- I'm not leaving him.

05:01.525 --> 05:06.572
All right. I'll go and grab some stuff.
Be back in a half hour, OK?

05:34.642 --> 05:37.645
What are you doing? Leave him alone!

05:37.812 --> 05:40.272
Who are you people?
I'm calling Security.

05:40.439 --> 05:42.942
I'm Agent Lytell.
I work with your husband.

05:43.109 --> 05:45.736
I don't care who you work with.

05:45.903 --> 05:50.199
Tell Tom I figured it out.
I know where I have to be.

05:52.201 --> 05:55.037
Don't worry. He's gonna be safe.

05:55.204 --> 06:00.084
The government's gonna be supervising
his medical care from now on.

07:06.752 --> 07:11.465
You snatched that kid from a hospital?
What were you thinking?

07:11.782 --> 07:15.118
He's the only witness to an abduction.

07:15.285 --> 07:17.079
He can't remember his own name.

07:17.245 --> 07:20.040
Then we'll help him remember.

07:20.207 --> 07:22.959
His mother's upset. It's understandable.

07:23.126 --> 07:25.796
- But DC sent me...
- Tom!

07:25.962 --> 07:28.507
- Where's my son?
- Whoa!

07:28.674 --> 07:32.844
- Get your hands off me.
- I'll ask you one more time.

07:34.137 --> 07:38.016
- Ryland? You wanna help me?
- It's a tough call.

07:38.183 --> 07:40.977
- Where's Kyle?
- All right, Tom.

07:41.144 --> 07:43.397
- Put the gun away.
- Dennis...

07:43.563 --> 07:46.983
Tom, put the gun away.

07:48.360 --> 07:51.780
- You should have let me pull the trigger.
- I was tempted.

07:51.947 --> 07:54.616
But shooting Lytell won't get Kyle back.

07:54.783 --> 07:57.536
It'd make me feel a hell of a lot better.

07:57.702 --> 08:00.831
Why Kyle?
Why didn't he go after Shawn?

08:00.997 --> 08:03.750
Our doctors went over Shawn
dozens of times.

08:03.917 --> 08:07.003
- Kyle's new territory for them.
- New territory?

08:07.170 --> 08:09.464
- That's my son.
- I know that.

08:09.631 --> 08:13.218
- Can't you call DC?
- What good would that do?

08:13.385 --> 08:16.012
DC put Lytell here in the first place.

08:16.179 --> 08:19.266
- They're backing his play.
- So we do nothing?

08:19.433 --> 08:22.269
- I didn't say that. We'll get Kyle back.
- When?

08:22.436 --> 08:26.064
For Christ's sake, I don't know.
I just heard an hour ago.

08:26.231 --> 08:28.233
I don't know where Lytell put him.

08:29.317 --> 08:31.486
Not good enough, Dennis.

08:31.653 --> 08:34.573
I'm not sitting around
while you play phone tag.

08:34.739 --> 08:38.827
- I'm getting my son. Get your hands off.
- Tom!

08:38.994 --> 08:40.996
We go back a long way.

08:41.163 --> 08:45.250
If you try to go around me on this,
none of it matters.

08:48.211 --> 08:50.255
I know.

08:54.134 --> 08:56.803
Tom, what happened
between you and Lytell?

08:56.970 --> 08:59.097
Ask Ryland.

08:59.264 --> 09:00.974
Tom!

09:05.437 --> 09:06.897
- Tom!
- What?

09:07.063 --> 09:09.608
- If you're in trouble, I need to know.
- Why?

09:09.774 --> 09:13.445
- Cos I might be able to help.
- Just stay out of it, all right?

09:14.529 --> 09:16.573
Drive the car.

09:21.161 --> 09:24.789
Blood work looks fine,
the RH factor levels are normal

09:24.956 --> 09:27.083
and your calcium's OK.

09:28.835 --> 09:31.171
So how do you feel, Lily?

09:31.338 --> 09:34.799
- It's hard sometimes.
- That's to be expected.

09:37.135 --> 09:39.679
Now, where was I?

09:40.680 --> 09:45.185
Oh, right. I'll have to draw
some more amniotic fluid.

09:46.186 --> 09:49.230
Why? Is something wrong?

09:50.899 --> 09:54.027
What kind of genetic anomaly?

09:54.194 --> 09:58.531
All I know is she wants to grow
one of the baby's chromosomes in a lab.

10:02.494 --> 10:04.537
It'll be OK.

10:19.761 --> 10:23.473
It's gonna be a beautiful 18 holes.
Either of you play golf?

10:23.640 --> 10:26.851
- I'm afraid not.
- That's too bad.

10:27.018 --> 10:29.854
Listen, about that doctor you sent us to.

10:30.021 --> 10:33.942
Roxanne Kern. She's the best OBGYN
in the Pacific northwest.

10:34.109 --> 10:38.613
You're in good hands. So how did
that support group meeting go?

10:38.780 --> 10:42.992
- It went well, thank you.
- Nobody complain about the catering?

10:43.159 --> 10:46.454
I have to admit,
the lobster sushi was a great idea.

10:46.621 --> 10:48.790
You see? You just have to trust me.

10:49.916 --> 10:52.502
Your girlfriend has quite an imagination.

10:52.669 --> 10:57.006
She thought I was trying
to steal her away from you.

10:57.173 --> 11:00.552
- Can you believe that?
- Er... not really.

11:01.970 --> 11:06.724
I like your confidence.
See? You were worried about nothing.

11:10.645 --> 11:12.856
I wasn't worried.

11:23.658 --> 11:28.121
- We've gotta tell him.
- I'll do it. It should be me.

11:28.288 --> 11:30.498
When?

11:30.665 --> 11:33.668
Soon.
I can't take all this sneaking around.

11:35.253 --> 11:40.967
- Besides, I miss seeing you.
- I miss you, too.

11:48.474 --> 11:52.604
You suspected that Shawn had these
abilities since his coming home party

11:52.770 --> 11:54.856
and you never told me.

11:55.023 --> 11:57.817
- I never told Linda.
- You're divorcing her.

11:57.984 --> 11:59.986
- I'm your partner.
- I know.

12:00.153 --> 12:04.282
When we were assigned to the 4400,
you were calling them viruses.

12:04.449 --> 12:06.784
Have you noticed any change in me?

12:06.951 --> 12:10.330
Maybe because I have one of them
living in my apartment.

12:12.916 --> 12:16.920
- Point taken.
- I would have told you.

12:17.086 --> 12:19.130
I heard you, all right?

12:20.465 --> 12:23.468
- Can we continue the reprimand later?
- Fine.

12:26.304 --> 12:28.890
- What are we going to do about Kyle?
- "We"?

12:29.057 --> 12:31.142
Of course "we".

12:32.602 --> 12:35.897
We are gonna go find him
and bring him home.

12:36.064 --> 12:38.107
Then we better get to work.

12:44.529 --> 12:46.781
Mr Collier is not available right now.

12:46.948 --> 12:50.994
I'll have him return your call.
Thank you, Dr Kern.

12:51.161 --> 12:53.497
Dr Kern, the OBGYN?

12:53.663 --> 12:57.876
- Mm-hm.
- Jordan about to have a baby?

12:58.043 --> 13:00.253
- I wouldn't know.
- Huh.

13:01.922 --> 13:04.633
Here's the security logs
he asked to see.

13:04.799 --> 13:06.885
I'll put them on his desk.

13:07.052 --> 13:10.472
Can I see Jordan's phone logs
for the last couple of weeks?

13:11.640 --> 13:13.808
What for?

13:14.976 --> 13:18.104
He's been receiving
some threatening mail.

13:18.271 --> 13:21.358
I want to crosscheck it
with his incoming calls.

13:24.819 --> 13:27.155
It doesn't leave this office.

13:36.498 --> 13:39.292
I need to see Dr Kern right now.

13:39.459 --> 13:41.962
Mr Tyler, she can't be disturbed.

13:41.968 --> 13:44.471
- Mr Tyler!
- This won't take long. Dr Kern.

13:44.638 --> 13:47.641
- She's busy.
- Does Lily have an appointment?

13:47.808 --> 13:51.937
No. Why do you call Jordan Collier
every time she comes to see you?

13:53.897 --> 13:57.776
- My phone habits don't concern you.
- I think they do.

13:57.943 --> 14:01.613
What does Collier know
about Lily's baby that she doesn't?

14:03.532 --> 14:06.118
Sickle cell anaemia?

14:06.284 --> 14:09.496
How can my baby have the trait
for sickle cell anaemia?

14:11.832 --> 14:14.918
Unless the father's black.

14:16.920 --> 14:19.714
Maybe he is.

14:19.881 --> 14:22.968
- What are you saying, Richard?
- I don't know.

14:24.427 --> 14:28.431
Maybe whoever took us
used me as some kind of donor.

14:29.683 --> 14:33.603
The question is, why would Jordan
have Dr Kern keep this from us?

14:33.770 --> 14:37.357
The baby's carrying the sickle cell trait.

14:38.358 --> 14:41.987
That brings us closer.
Maybe he doesn't want that to happen.

14:42.153 --> 14:44.447
Maybe.

14:44.614 --> 14:47.534
I think it's time me and him had a talk.

14:52.163 --> 14:54.749
Michelle Hickock, returnee number 938.

14:54.916 --> 15:00.088
She's coming in at 4:00 for counselling
and I want to see her afterwards, OK?

15:10.098 --> 15:11.099
He's logged on.

15:11.266 --> 15:13.935
Lytell's on the network. You good to go?

15:15.145 --> 15:17.939
Tom really appreciates you helping him.

15:19.149 --> 15:21.610
I'm not doing it for Tom.

15:45.634 --> 15:48.303
Come on.

15:50.930 --> 15:55.477
Kyle's being held at the quarantine
Centre, building 9, sub-basement 3.

15:55.644 --> 15:57.979
That's great. I owe you.

15:58.938 --> 16:01.274
OK. Well...

16:01.441 --> 16:05.653
- Marco, thanks for your help.
- No worries.

16:05.820 --> 16:09.449
- You ready to roll?
- We should wait for the nightshift.

16:09.616 --> 16:12.744
- They're half staff.
- OK. I'll pick you up at 4:00.

16:12.911 --> 16:14.954
See you.

16:20.627 --> 16:24.881
This is the place. It's just outside
of the city in West Belleview.

16:25.048 --> 16:27.133
The seller won't be there?

16:27.300 --> 16:30.512
He's in Spain. Another realtor told me.

16:30.678 --> 16:33.223
- It'll be a perfect safe house.
- Set it up.

16:33.390 --> 16:36.810
- Make sure you're not followed.
- I'm being watched?

16:36.976 --> 16:39.354
If I was Lytell, I'd keep an eye on you.

16:39.521 --> 16:41.648
Check your mirrors and stay cool.

16:41.815 --> 16:44.692
I never thought I'd have to use
what you taught me.

16:44.859 --> 16:47.362
You'll do fine.

16:47.529 --> 16:51.699
- I'll get Kyle and I'll meet you up there.
- I'll be waiting.

16:51.866 --> 16:54.452
- You be careful.
- I will.

17:03.294 --> 17:08.133
They're nice, huh? I remember how
much you told me you liked moonstones.

17:08.299 --> 17:12.178
I do. But I can't accept these.

17:14.388 --> 17:17.474
Why not? I mean, I got them for you.

17:20.811 --> 17:24.607
Come on, Nikki.
Look, I know I messed up.

17:25.525 --> 17:29.487
- Didn't Shawn talk to you?
- What does he have to do with it?

17:35.285 --> 17:37.537
Nikki?

17:46.337 --> 17:48.590
- Hey.
- Maia ready?

17:48.756 --> 17:52.343
Maia's talking
with one of your colleagues.

17:57.015 --> 17:59.809
Some of the clothes look funny.
And the cars.

17:59.976 --> 18:03.479
But I don't know.
Video games are kind of fun.

18:03.646 --> 18:06.232
Did you like the video games
at quarantine?

18:06.399 --> 18:09.277
I hardly ever got a chance to play.

18:09.444 --> 18:13.448
Lytell, what are you doing here?

18:13.615 --> 18:17.285
Just talking with Maia.
I thought it was time we met.

18:19.245 --> 18:22.916
- Stay away from her.
- That's not really your call, is it?

18:24.584 --> 18:26.836
Maia, it was nice talking with you.

18:27.003 --> 18:29.297
We'll do it again soon.

18:35.762 --> 18:40.058
I don't like him.
And he doesn't really like me either.

18:40.224 --> 18:43.186
Well, don't you worry about him.

18:43.353 --> 18:47.857
- Are you sure?
- Oh! You listen to me, Maia.

18:48.024 --> 18:53.571
I am absolutely sure. I am not gonna let
anything bad happen to you. Hear me?

18:53.738 --> 18:56.032
- All right?
- OK.

19:07.335 --> 19:10.171
Jordan, do you have a minute?

19:10.338 --> 19:13.383
I know why you're here.

19:13.549 --> 19:16.886
Roxanne Kern called me
as soon as you left her office.

19:18.429 --> 19:22.934
I hope you and Lily aren't blowing this up
into something bigger than it is,

19:23.101 --> 19:25.686
cos a doctor's
trying to get on my good side.

19:25.853 --> 19:30.775
We appreciate everything you've done,
from the house to my job.

19:30.942 --> 19:34.362
Our lives have been a lot more
comfortable since we met.

19:34.529 --> 19:38.449
- You're gonna hurt me now, aren't you?
- It's time you back off.

19:38.616 --> 19:41.119
Let us run our own lives.

19:44.038 --> 19:46.082
Whatever you want.

19:46.249 --> 19:49.168
Tell Lily I said hi, will you?

19:52.463 --> 19:55.049
I'll do that.

20:01.431 --> 20:04.475
- You good to go?
- Just give me a sec.

20:07.728 --> 20:13.234
Gloria, don't answer the door
to anyone you don't know, OK?

20:13.401 --> 20:15.611
Cool.

20:15.778 --> 20:19.699
- Are you leaving now?
- Yeah. I'll be back before you wake up.

20:23.244 --> 20:25.079
OK.

20:25.246 --> 20:27.790
Better go. Bye.

20:31.252 --> 20:35.423
- Diana.
- Don't worry.

20:35.590 --> 20:38.467
- You'll find him.
- Find who?

20:39.844 --> 20:42.513
Your son, Kyle.

20:42.680 --> 20:45.558
He's the answer.

20:48.853 --> 20:52.815
- The answer to what?
- Everything.

21:17.164 --> 21:19.667
I want to see Kyle Baldwin, please.

21:25.297 --> 21:28.425
- You're not on the list.
- I'm a friend of the family.

21:28.592 --> 21:31.011
I want to know that he's all right.

21:31.178 --> 21:34.431
He's not even one of the 4400
and his father works with me

21:34.598 --> 21:39.937
and if you could just give me something
I could tell him cos...

21:40.104 --> 21:44.650
Come on, we're both supposed
to be on the same side, right?

21:44.817 --> 21:49.988
- I'll see what I can find out.
- Thank you so much. That's great.

21:51.323 --> 21:54.201
You won't even have a headache
when you wake up.

21:54.368 --> 21:57.204
Well, maybe a little headache.

21:58.038 --> 21:59.998
Come on in.

22:00.165 --> 22:03.961
Kyle. Hey, buddy. It's me, buddy.

22:10.884 --> 22:13.095
- Highland Beach.
- What about it?

22:13.262 --> 22:16.140
- That's where I have to go.
- Highland Beach.

22:17.766 --> 22:20.894
Let's get you out of here first.
Come on. Up.

22:22.229 --> 22:25.190
We got him.
He's sitting right here next to me.

22:26.859 --> 22:29.319
He's about the same.
No worse, anyway.

22:29.486 --> 22:31.864
See you in a little while.

22:32.030 --> 22:36.410
- How far away is this safe house?
- It's about 30 miles.

22:36.577 --> 22:38.662
Your mom's waiting for you, buddy.

22:41.874 --> 22:44.168
No. Highland Beach.

22:44.334 --> 22:46.086
- Hey!
- Kyle! Let go!

22:46.253 --> 22:48.297
- Kyle!
- Highland Beach!

22:48.463 --> 22:51.592
- Let go! Let go!
- Calm down!

22:52.634 --> 22:56.180
- We have to go there now.
- What's at Highland Beach?

22:56.346 --> 23:00.684
- That's where Shawn disappeared.
- I have to go back there.

23:00.851 --> 23:03.854
Just calm down, buddy. Just...

23:04.021 --> 23:08.150
- If that's what you want, we'll take you.
- Are you sure about that?

23:09.401 --> 23:11.445
Kyle's the answer, right?

23:14.990 --> 23:17.367
Two agents are operating outside us.

23:17.534 --> 23:22.623
I noticed. It's because you pulled
the Baldwin kid out of the hospital.

23:22.789 --> 23:27.502
- DC wouldn't see it that way.
- DC decided to send you here.

23:29.922 --> 23:32.424
Are we gonna bring him in or not?

23:32.591 --> 23:34.885
Find him.

23:37.054 --> 23:39.932
These people are coming
to the next meeting.

23:40.098 --> 23:43.602
It's bigger than the last
so we may need a couple more tables.

23:43.769 --> 23:46.897
- I'll take care of it.
- Thank you.

23:48.607 --> 23:50.484
Lily.

23:50.651 --> 23:52.736
Can I see you for a minute?

23:55.572 --> 24:00.827
- I have a few errands to run.
- This won't take long.

24:07.960 --> 24:10.045
Where did you get this?

24:10.212 --> 24:15.509
I've been doing security checks on
everyone who's moved into the complex.

24:15.676 --> 24:18.303
Don't look shocked, Lily.

24:18.470 --> 24:23.600
A lot of people would love
to see me fall on my face here.

24:23.767 --> 24:27.979
A scandal like this would allow them
to force me out of the company.

24:28.146 --> 24:32.067
- Richard wouldn't do this.
- I'd have thought so, too.

24:32.234 --> 24:35.237
I guess we were both wrong.

24:38.073 --> 24:42.911
Do you really think this is going
to change the way I feel about him?

24:43.078 --> 24:45.288
That's up to you.

24:45.455 --> 24:49.292
But Lily...
you really have to ask yourself...

24:51.169 --> 24:54.715
Is this the man
you want raising your baby?

24:56.758 --> 24:59.428
Aren't you gonna say something?

25:00.595 --> 25:03.765
It was my 23rd birthday.

25:03.932 --> 25:07.352
A bunch of guys from the barracks
invited me out to a bar.

25:07.519 --> 25:10.272
- You don't drink.
- Didn't then either.

25:10.439 --> 25:13.900
But it was a big deal
them asking me to come along.

25:15.402 --> 25:19.406
In those days, Negroes and whites
didn't do much socialising.

25:20.782 --> 25:23.452
So I went.

25:23.618 --> 25:26.621
It was kind of nice, you know?

25:26.788 --> 25:33.086
Then this woman started
coming onto me. People started staring.

25:33.253 --> 25:37.799
So I figured it was time
for me to get out of there.

25:42.471 --> 25:46.266
She followed me outside
and asked me to go home with her.

25:46.433 --> 25:48.477
I declined respectfully.

25:51.062 --> 25:54.107
That's when she started screaming.

25:54.274 --> 25:58.695
- That's all that happened?
- That's all it took in 1945.

25:58.862 --> 26:02.616
But the statement the woman made
to the police. I mean...

26:02.782 --> 26:06.620
- It's so detailed.
- But Lily, none of it's true.

26:07.704 --> 26:10.498
If I hadn't been exonerated
of those charges,

26:10.665 --> 26:15.462
would the air force have sent me
to flight school? Made me a pilot?

26:17.255 --> 26:20.967
The woman lied.
The charges got dropped.

26:23.595 --> 26:29.309
- Why would Jordan bring this up?
- He wants you doubt me.

26:29.476 --> 26:32.270
Doubt us.

26:35.899 --> 26:38.235
Do you?

26:49.829 --> 26:52.916
We've gotta pack
whatever we can in five minutes.

26:53.083 --> 26:56.628
We're getting out of here.

26:56.795 --> 26:59.464
They're heading west on Sandburg.

26:59.631 --> 27:02.300
There are no freeways in that direction.

27:05.053 --> 27:09.391
Highland Beach. That's where they're
going. Have my car brought around.

27:09.557 --> 27:14.312
I don't care what you do, just keep your
mouth shut and stay out of my way.

27:18.191 --> 27:21.820
Come on, Mom. Are you serious?
The movies? Like, you and me?

27:21.987 --> 27:25.407
Is that so weird? We used to go
to the movies all the time.

27:25.573 --> 27:28.702
When I was six.

27:28.868 --> 27:31.371
Shawn!

27:31.538 --> 27:33.456
You prick!

27:33.623 --> 27:36.042
- Danny!
- Danny!

27:36.209 --> 27:39.421
- Listen to me...
- You goddamn freak!

27:39.587 --> 27:41.798
Danny, stop this!

27:41.965 --> 27:46.261
Boys, please! Danny, Shawn, stop!

27:46.428 --> 27:49.055
Stop blaming me for Nikki!

27:49.222 --> 27:52.517
Don't you see
it's over between you two?

27:56.479 --> 28:00.108
That's enough! Shawn, stop it!
You're killing him!

28:01.151 --> 28:04.863
- What did you do?
- I didn't mean to do anything!

28:07.907 --> 28:10.493
- Danny!
- Get away from him!

28:14.122 --> 28:16.249
Shawn?

28:16.416 --> 28:19.878
- I heard you guys shouting.
- Don't touch me.

28:20.044 --> 28:22.005
What?

28:22.172 --> 28:24.340
Don't touch me.

28:27.302 --> 28:32.056
You're the only good thing that's
happened to me since I've been back.

28:32.223 --> 28:36.603
But I can't stay here
and you can't come where I'm going.

28:36.770 --> 28:38.646
Shawn...

28:41.691 --> 28:44.402
I love you, Nikki.

28:44.569 --> 28:49.574
- I love you.
- What are you doing? Shawn!

28:49.741 --> 28:53.328
No! Stay here and talk about this.

28:54.078 --> 28:57.707
Shawn! Shawn, what are you doing?

28:57.874 --> 28:59.751
Shawn!

29:19.187 --> 29:21.773
- What's all this?
- What's it look like?

29:21.940 --> 29:25.151
Have you thought about
what you're doing?

29:25.318 --> 29:28.488
- It is dangerous outside those gates.
- We'll risk it.

29:28.655 --> 29:32.450
- Lily, think about the baby.
- What has the baby to do with this?

29:32.617 --> 29:35.536
That baby could be the key to the future

29:35.703 --> 29:39.040
and I can protect it
better than Richard or anyone.

29:43.962 --> 29:46.881
- Lily, get in the car.
- I can't let you do that.

29:47.048 --> 29:49.217
Stay away from her.

29:49.384 --> 29:51.010
Argh!

30:31.592 --> 30:34.387
Go ahead! Run!

30:37.348 --> 30:40.101
It won't do you any good.

30:41.144 --> 30:44.731
I will find you.

30:44.897 --> 30:47.734
That baby belongs with me.

31:03.759 --> 31:06.136
Kyle!

31:09.306 --> 31:13.686
Kyle, we've been walking for ten
minutes. What are you looking for?

31:13.852 --> 31:16.772
Maybe we can help you, Kyle.

31:18.357 --> 31:20.651
This is where we found him.

31:29.994 --> 31:32.830
We're running out of time.

31:32.997 --> 31:35.916
Kyle, I brought you here like you asked.

31:36.083 --> 31:40.212
But if there's something you need to do,
you better do it fast.

31:40.379 --> 31:42.423
I belong here.

31:42.590 --> 31:45.384
I tried really hard and...

31:45.551 --> 31:50.514
no matter what I've done,
which way I've turned, it just...

31:50.681 --> 31:53.434
It sucks.

31:53.601 --> 31:57.479
I need to clear my head
and get away for a while.

31:58.939 --> 32:03.235
I guess what I'm asking
is if I could stay here for a while.

32:04.111 --> 32:07.323
Shawn, you're one of the 4400.

32:07.489 --> 32:11.827
As far as I'm concerned,
you can stay here as long as you want.

32:11.994 --> 32:15.289
That's great, man. Thanks. Thank you.

32:19.043 --> 32:23.630
So, erm... tell me a little bit more
about this ability of yours.

32:27.843 --> 32:32.890
- Any idea where we're headed?
- I'll know it when I see it.

32:33.057 --> 32:36.435
He's gonna come after us.

32:42.941 --> 32:45.611
The baby likes that.

32:47.738 --> 32:52.701
You know...
It really wouldn't be so bad, would it?

32:52.868 --> 32:55.454
If you were the father?

32:57.581 --> 33:00.709
No, it wouldn't be bad at all.

33:18.352 --> 33:20.938
That's their car. Let's go.

33:21.897 --> 33:26.026
Listen, these are not criminals.
They're two of our own.

33:26.193 --> 33:30.447
Keep your gun holstered. There's no
cause for anybody to get hurt.

33:30.614 --> 33:35.744
Kyle, they're coming for you.
They want to take you away.

33:35.911 --> 33:39.081
They're too late.

34:05.732 --> 34:08.652
- Kyle!
- No! Tom, don't!

34:24.793 --> 34:27.379
Kyle?

34:27.545 --> 34:29.630
Tom.

34:35.012 --> 34:37.764
- You're not my son, are you?
- No.

34:37.931 --> 34:42.643
Kyle was meant to be a channel,
a way to communicate.

34:42.811 --> 34:45.813
- Communicate with who?
- With you.

34:46.940 --> 34:50.360
To guide you in your dealings
with the returnees.

34:51.360 --> 34:56.408
But something went wrong.
Shawn interrupted the process.

35:00.454 --> 35:03.540
That's what put him in a coma.

35:03.707 --> 35:06.001
He was like that for three years.

35:06.168 --> 35:08.378
Tom!

35:12.507 --> 35:14.926
Tom.

35:21.224 --> 35:23.185
Tom.

35:39.534 --> 35:42.204
Who are you? What are you?

35:42.371 --> 35:44.831
I'm human.

35:44.998 --> 35:50.170
- Like you.
- No. You're nothing like me.

35:50.337 --> 35:52.589
I come from a different time.

35:52.756 --> 35:55.092
That is all.

35:57.052 --> 35:59.679
Your future.

36:03.225 --> 36:05.769
Is that where you took them?

36:07.729 --> 36:10.899
My nephew and all the others?

36:11.066 --> 36:13.777
- We needed them.
- For what?

36:15.320 --> 36:16.822
To survive.

36:19.616 --> 36:21.701
Skouris.

36:22.828 --> 36:25.622
Skouris!

36:36.341 --> 36:39.928
In my time, humanity is dying out.

36:43.807 --> 36:47.978
You mean it's all going to end?
Everything?

36:48.145 --> 36:50.939
- What is going on?
- Kyle brought us out here.

36:51.106 --> 36:55.235
- Like he knew it was going to happen.
- Maybe he's not Kyle Baldwin.

36:55.402 --> 36:59.114
He said he wasn't.
Maybe he's telling the truth.

36:59.281 --> 37:03.034
Tom? Tom, are you all right?

37:03.201 --> 37:07.372
We've got to do something. He could
take Baldwin with him. Or kill him.

37:07.539 --> 37:10.876
Nobody's doing anything
until we know what's going on.

37:12.294 --> 37:17.465
Only those we took could prevent
the catastrophe from happening.

37:17.632 --> 37:21.678
That's why they've been altered
and seeded back into the timeline.

37:21.845 --> 37:25.348
Why here? Why now?

37:25.515 --> 37:29.477
Because history tells us
this is where the path to oblivion began.

37:30.687 --> 37:34.774
And the people you took are gonna stop
that from happening? How?

37:34.941 --> 37:38.403
They've begun their work.
And you have begun yours.

37:38.570 --> 37:41.865
- Tom, come on.
- Do something or I will.

37:42.032 --> 37:43.491
I need you out of there.

37:43.658 --> 37:47.245
I don't understand.
What are we supposed to do?

37:49.205 --> 37:51.917
- You have to help them.
- How?

37:54.127 --> 37:55.128
Go!

37:57.047 --> 37:59.299
How?

38:03.970 --> 38:06.014
You're bleeding.

38:20.153 --> 38:22.864
Oh, God. Get an ambulance. Now!

38:23.031 --> 38:25.116
Kyle! Kyle!

38:26.326 --> 38:28.912
Kyle! Kyle! Kyle!

38:29.079 --> 38:33.166
Kyle! Stay with me, Kyle! Stay with me!

38:33.333 --> 38:37.087
Stay with me! Look at me! Look at me!
Stay! Stay!

38:37.253 --> 38:38.797
No! No!

38:38.963 --> 38:42.509
Kyle! Kyle! Look at me! Look at me!

38:42.676 --> 38:45.970
Stay with me, Kyle! Stay with me!

38:46.137 --> 38:48.556
Stay with me! Come on! Come on!

38:57.399 --> 39:00.652
- No!
- Tom...

39:51.077 --> 39:53.246
- Dad?
- Kyle!

39:53.413 --> 39:55.665
What are you doing here?

39:55.832 --> 39:58.334
- Where's Shawn?
- Kyle?

39:58.501 --> 40:02.547
- I can explain about the beer.
- No!

40:02.714 --> 40:06.426
Forget the beer.
You don't have to explain anything.

40:06.593 --> 40:09.846
What's going on?

40:11.306 --> 40:14.809
Tom. Tom.

40:14.976 --> 40:17.270
What did you see?

40:25.695 --> 40:28.823
I got you, Kyle.

41:05.777 --> 41:08.112
The baby.

41:08.279 --> 41:11.074
It's time?

41:19.207 --> 41:21.626
I'll get the car.

41:22.305 --> 41:28.754
