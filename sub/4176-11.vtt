an eye witness...

13:46.451 --> 13:50.911
who saw two men
gun down Brenan Hefner.

13:50.997 --> 13:53.363
Bobby Munson was
positively iden tified

13:53.458 --> 13:55.870
[Over Speaker]
Your |.D. could take
a little court time, but...

13:55.960 --> 13:58.337
it’ll happen.

13:58.421 --> 14:01.379
I have no idea
what you’re talking about.

14:07.805 --> 14:13.675
You see, she didn’t get the eyes
or the nose quite right.

14:13.770 --> 14:16.182
That’s why it fell short
of a positive l D.

knows that you and your
family are gone.

saw you get into our big,
comfortable black sedan.

No cuffs.

14:29.452 --> 14:31.659
And what with all
the inconvenience,

14:31.746 --> 14:35.159

I could do was, uh,

14:35.250 --> 14:37.957

big bills ofyours.

They’ll know I wasn’t the witness.
Mm. Eventually.

15:01.401 --> 15:05.394
But, you see, the US. Attorney
won ’t release the identizjv
of the witness until pretrial

15:05.488 --> 15:09.072
And that could take weeks.
I can only hold you for 48 hours.

is going to happen...
