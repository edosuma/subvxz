WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:01.242
Previously on "Six"...

00:01.245 --> 00:02.760
When do I do the next one?

00:02.762 --> 00:06.173
Mr. Mohammed! FBI! Open up.

00:06.176 --> 00:08.543
Rip was at our house. They
must've followed him from there.

00:08.546 --> 00:10.007
- They know where we live.
- No.

00:10.010 --> 00:11.983
I'm not going back to that
house, and neither are the kids.

00:11.985 --> 00:14.029
I'm gonna find whoever did this,
and we're gonna make them pay.

00:14.031 --> 00:15.754
We're gonna put them
in the ground, okay?

00:15.757 --> 00:17.616
On the ground!

00:20.255 --> 00:23.245
Hey, Caulder. You okay?

00:23.248 --> 00:25.382
Aah!

00:25.385 --> 00:27.218
You still getting those headaches?

00:27.221 --> 00:28.736
Dad? Dad?

00:28.739 --> 00:31.520
This is the last time.

00:31.523 --> 00:34.328
Do you understand what I'm saying?

00:34.331 --> 00:36.330
We need to spend some time apart.

00:36.333 --> 00:37.460
We're doing that.

00:37.463 --> 00:39.928
Or maybe... maybe see other people.

00:39.931 --> 00:41.890
Ah, Gina, my number one spook.

00:41.893 --> 00:44.800
My asset from Bosnia...
Tamerlin Shishoni.

00:44.803 --> 00:46.255
But you know him as "The Prince."

00:46.258 --> 00:49.000
You'll take care of them, yes?
That was our deal, remember?

00:49.003 --> 00:51.472
You bring me Stankevich,
I'll take care of all of you.

00:54.596 --> 00:56.789
Did you screw us?!
Are there more coming?!

01:00.026 --> 01:02.684
Your asset burned us.
Where's that son of a bitch?

01:02.687 --> 01:04.617
He killed the one person I trusted.

01:04.620 --> 01:05.929
He tried to kill you.

01:05.932 --> 01:07.359
Help me find him.

01:09.000 --> 01:15.074

01:36.353 --> 01:38.853
- Yes?
- Prince?

01:38.855 --> 01:41.723
Forgive me, but I need to
confirm your wishes directly.

01:41.725 --> 01:44.727
The game may have been
compromised by the Americans.

01:44.730 --> 01:46.530
That's unfortunate.

01:46.533 --> 01:49.493
Yes. I spoke to Boko Haram.

01:49.496 --> 01:51.373
They'll accept Michael as compensation

01:51.376 --> 01:52.774
along with the girls.

01:52.777 --> 01:54.700
Our other plans are unaffected.

01:54.703 --> 01:56.290
What are you waiting for?

01:56.293 --> 01:58.404
I know Michael acted imprudently,

01:58.407 --> 02:00.837
but he is valuable to the cause.

02:00.840 --> 02:03.175
Michael's cause is himself.

02:03.178 --> 02:06.384
He is not without arrogance.

02:06.387 --> 02:07.886
Or ambition.

02:10.226 --> 02:13.194
Emir Muttaqi...

02:13.197 --> 02:16.130
I know you love Michael

02:16.133 --> 02:18.257
as a father loves a son.

02:19.895 --> 02:22.461
And it will put a hole in your heart,

02:22.463 --> 02:24.397
I promise you.

02:26.434 --> 02:30.204
But remember, other people
have made that sacrifice.

02:30.207 --> 02:32.140
I trust in your wisdom.

02:36.649 --> 02:38.962

03:02.349 --> 03:04.477

03:08.598 --> 03:10.102
Prince visits the place

03:10.105 --> 03:13.677
where his wife and kids
were massacred by the Serbs.

03:13.680 --> 03:17.315
There. By the fence.

03:17.317 --> 03:19.684
Couple hundred meters from the village,

03:19.686 --> 03:22.087
just east of the church.

03:22.090 --> 03:23.626
You sure about the date?

03:23.629 --> 03:25.662
Same date every year.

03:32.131 --> 03:34.332
You better not fuck me.

03:36.135 --> 03:38.002
He said John is the Prince.

03:38.004 --> 03:39.837
He told us where we can find him.

03:39.839 --> 03:41.672
It's all in there.

03:45.807 --> 03:48.430
He said the Prince will be
in that field in 72 hours.

03:50.421 --> 03:52.149
Nasry's our only source.

03:52.152 --> 03:54.680
I know it's single-source, but
it's the best Intel we have.

03:54.683 --> 03:56.215
Vince is hit!

03:56.218 --> 03:58.054
Your asset burned us.

03:58.056 --> 03:59.923
Vince, hang on.

03:59.926 --> 04:01.604
Where's that son of a bitch?

04:01.607 --> 04:03.259
Gina! are you listening?

04:03.262 --> 04:04.913
Sometimes you gotta roll the dice.

04:04.916 --> 04:06.482
Okay, you want John, I want the Prince.

04:06.485 --> 04:07.623
You're saying it's the same guy.

04:07.625 --> 04:10.165
This may be our only chance to grab him.

04:10.168 --> 04:12.337
Now I'm running this up the chain.

04:25.505 --> 04:28.706
Michael, please. answer.

04:28.709 --> 04:32.911
What am I supposed to
do? Tell me what to do.

04:47.704 --> 04:49.938
...who had been held by the FBI

04:49.940 --> 04:51.212
for questioning in connection

04:51.215 --> 04:53.149
with the murder of Richard Taggart.

04:53.152 --> 04:55.888
Taggart, the controversial
former member of SEAL Team Six

04:55.891 --> 04:57.506
whose confession divided the nation

04:57.509 --> 05:01.978
was considered a traitor
by some, a hero by many.

05:04.751 --> 05:08.121
Hey.

05:08.124 --> 05:09.891
Hey, dude. You wanna get a beer?

05:09.894 --> 05:11.758
Hey, man. Did you see the news?

05:11.761 --> 05:14.235
They, uh, they just let that asshole go.

05:14.238 --> 05:17.239
Yeah, well, the dogs bark,
but the caravan moves on.

05:17.242 --> 05:20.266
What, you, uh,

05:20.269 --> 05:22.570
what, did you read that in a
fortune cookie or something?

05:22.572 --> 05:25.039
No, it's, um...

05:25.041 --> 05:27.407
It's from, uh...

05:28.447 --> 05:29.704
Alex?

05:29.707 --> 05:32.674
- You still at the Lamplighter?
- No. No, that place sucked.

05:32.677 --> 05:34.810
I'm at the Holiday Hotel.

05:34.813 --> 05:36.379
You wanna crash at my place?

05:36.382 --> 05:38.283
Mi casa su casa, catch some waves.

05:38.286 --> 05:39.552
It'd probably do you some good.

05:39.555 --> 05:41.149
I don't surf, Alex.

05:41.152 --> 05:43.384
Therein lies the problem, man.

05:43.387 --> 05:46.388
Hey, what'd Lena say the other night?

05:46.391 --> 05:49.259
No, just, you know, she, uh...

05:49.262 --> 05:51.762
she wants some space
or whatever, you know.

05:51.765 --> 05:54.198
Well, I guess it's time to let
the bear out of the cage, huh?

05:54.201 --> 05:56.980
Hey, um, look, uh, room service is here.

05:56.983 --> 06:00.338
It's dinner, so, um, I'll...
I'll call you later, okay?

06:00.341 --> 06:02.075
- All right.
- Okay, bye.

06:26.667 --> 06:29.415
Ah!

06:48.220 --> 06:50.808
I went by the house today.

06:50.811 --> 06:53.279
It's still not rented.

06:53.282 --> 06:56.816
Anabel, I told you not to go back there.

06:56.819 --> 06:58.947
Why? Whoever did it would be, like,

06:58.950 --> 07:00.750
super stupid to come after us now.

07:06.061 --> 07:08.295
Dad, help me out here.

07:08.298 --> 07:10.097
Your mom's right.

07:10.100 --> 07:12.508
We're safer here, at least until we know

07:12.511 --> 07:14.811
we have the guys who did this to Rip.

07:14.813 --> 07:17.381
Are you serious?

07:17.383 --> 07:19.883
I miss my room. I miss
home. This is crazy.

07:19.885 --> 07:21.585
- No! No!
- Why can't we just go back?

07:21.587 --> 07:23.687
No!

07:36.568 --> 07:38.401
Hey.

07:51.560 --> 07:53.226
I want a gun.

07:55.619 --> 07:57.644
Guns are my other life.

07:57.647 --> 07:59.191
That was the deal.

07:59.194 --> 08:01.690
I never bring my other life home.

08:01.693 --> 08:06.128
I need a gun to protect the
kids when you're not around.

08:06.130 --> 08:09.754
You know how hard we train
just to use a gun safely, right?

08:09.757 --> 08:12.738
You'd be dangerous to
yourself and to the kids

08:12.741 --> 08:14.824
more than anybody else.

08:14.827 --> 08:17.561
We're safe, Bonita. I promise.

08:17.564 --> 08:19.163
Really?

08:22.712 --> 08:25.312
Tell that to Rip.

09:00.405 --> 09:02.315
Ahh!

09:03.632 --> 09:05.298
Whoo! Hit it!

09:10.207 --> 09:11.791
Ride the lightning, mother...

09:13.262 --> 09:15.495
- Whoo!
- Ohh.

09:15.497 --> 09:17.164
Ohh.

09:21.469 --> 09:23.036
- Get that out.
- I got you, I got you, I got you.

09:23.038 --> 09:24.938
Whoo! Oh.

09:24.940 --> 09:26.706
- Yeah!
- You're up, Fish.

09:26.708 --> 09:28.508
- Mnh! Mnh-mnh.
- It's Taser time, bro. Oh!

09:28.510 --> 09:30.343
I'm not doing that shit. Dude.

09:30.345 --> 09:32.378
Oh, it's getting late! I'm outta here.

09:32.380 --> 09:34.371
Oh, hell no, bro. A bet's a bet.

09:34.374 --> 09:35.677
- Come on, bro.
- Now I told you

09:35.679 --> 09:37.605
they'd let that so-called suspect go.

09:37.608 --> 09:38.910
Freakin' Saudi, man.

09:38.913 --> 09:40.720
That's an instant "Get
Out of Jail Free" card.

09:40.722 --> 09:43.055
You're up. Let's go!

09:43.057 --> 09:45.308
All right, I'll bite, man.

09:45.311 --> 09:47.605
Why do you think they
cut that suspect loose?

09:47.608 --> 09:51.643
Because our government is
full of globalist plutocrats

09:51.646 --> 09:54.121
are in bed with the
Saudis. Have been since

09:54.124 --> 09:57.059
they found oil in the sand
dunes in 1938. Am I right?

09:57.062 --> 10:01.205
15 of the 19 shitheads who
took down the Twin Towers?

10:01.208 --> 10:02.741
Saudi.

10:02.743 --> 10:05.527
Come on, guys. Read a fucking book.

10:05.530 --> 10:07.012
Follow the oil.

10:07.015 --> 10:10.082
Every time you put gas in your car,

10:10.085 --> 10:11.546
it goes directly into the pockets

10:11.549 --> 10:13.949
of the Islamic terrorist.

10:13.952 --> 10:15.585
That's what we're bleedin' for.

10:15.588 --> 10:17.387
Problem isn't Islam, okay?

10:17.390 --> 10:19.574
It's extremists, whatever religion.

10:19.577 --> 10:22.759
Uh... I don't see Buddhists
blowing themselves up.

10:22.762 --> 10:24.249
I mean, come on, man.

10:24.252 --> 10:26.004
Islam is just incompatible

10:26.007 --> 10:27.965
with life, liberty, and
the pursuit of happiness.

10:27.968 --> 10:30.564
Look, man, you do remember
something called the Crusades.

10:30.567 --> 10:32.167
It cuts both ways.

10:32.170 --> 10:33.737
Come on, Hah-vard.

10:33.740 --> 10:36.206
That shit was a thousand years ago.

10:36.208 --> 10:39.109
These guys? Right here?

10:39.111 --> 10:40.683
All the past 10.

10:40.686 --> 10:42.353
Guess what they have in common?

10:42.356 --> 10:45.357
- You keep track?
- Oh, come on. Like you don't?

10:45.360 --> 10:49.018
Because you're a sleeper. He
don't wanna shoot his boys.

10:49.021 --> 10:51.388
I get that. In fact, I respect it.

10:51.390 --> 10:53.390
That was Mohammed. That was Ab...

10:53.392 --> 10:55.025
Whoa.

10:55.027 --> 10:55.865
If I tattooed you

10:55.867 --> 10:58.410
with every guy I've
killed, I'd run out of skin.

10:58.413 --> 11:01.048
Keep your bullshit up,
I'll add you to the list.

11:01.051 --> 11:02.732
Easy, Fish.

11:02.734 --> 11:04.434
- I'm out of here.
- Good.

11:07.472 --> 11:11.004
You got, uh, any theories
on my kind you wanna add?

11:11.007 --> 11:13.074
No, man. I love brown people.

11:13.077 --> 11:14.510
Come on.

11:14.513 --> 11:16.230
Let's do this! Who's up?

11:17.714 --> 11:19.528
...and do whatever the hell you want...

11:19.531 --> 11:21.495
- Answer me!
- ...and get away with it? Huh?

11:21.498 --> 11:24.174
Look me in the eyes and tell
me you didn't do anything.

11:24.177 --> 11:26.149
I do not believe you. That's
what your kind say all the time.

11:26.151 --> 11:28.461
Come on! You killed a
goddamn American hero.

11:28.464 --> 11:30.047
You think you can get
away with that? Huh?

11:30.049 --> 11:31.582
No, man. I didn't do anything.
Is that what you think?

11:31.584 --> 11:32.729
I had nothing to do with it.

11:32.732 --> 11:35.453
I've heard your people
tell me that all kinds...

11:36.756 --> 11:38.892
It has nothing to do with
me. Nothing to do with me.

11:38.895 --> 11:40.451
Look me in the eye and tell me that.

11:42.156 --> 11:44.359
You son of a bitch. Get up!

11:44.362 --> 11:46.693
Get up! Get up!

11:46.696 --> 11:48.211
- Hey!
- Get up! Get up!

11:48.214 --> 11:50.434
Stop! Leave him alone!

11:50.436 --> 11:52.236
He didn't do anything!

11:52.238 --> 11:54.138
I'm gonna call the police!

11:54.140 --> 11:56.540
Get out of here! I'm calling them!

12:01.046 --> 12:03.112
We'll be back!

12:03.114 --> 12:05.081
You better be gone, Hadji!

12:08.754 --> 12:10.286
Thank you.

12:10.288 --> 12:13.957
Why... why do they hate us so much?

12:26.395 --> 12:28.229
Let's get you back to your place.

12:28.232 --> 12:30.064
I can help you get cleaned up.

12:30.067 --> 12:32.447
Please, I'm afraid to
be out there right now.

12:32.450 --> 12:34.309
I just wanna sit for a bit.

12:39.416 --> 12:42.585
- You shot that man?
- Let me explain.

12:42.587 --> 12:44.486
We're building something beautiful.

12:44.489 --> 12:46.197
For all Muslims... A family.

12:46.200 --> 12:48.356
You should join us, and I'll
introduce you to someone.

12:48.358 --> 12:51.526
- And once you've heard him...
- No, you can't build with hate.

12:51.528 --> 12:54.529
The Koran preaches peace.

12:56.967 --> 12:59.301
Show me.

12:59.303 --> 13:01.436
If you can show me where
it says that, I'll...

13:01.438 --> 13:04.205
I'll turn myself in.

13:04.207 --> 13:06.540
I'll get you the passage.

13:06.542 --> 13:08.977
It's in my room.

13:16.019 --> 13:17.485
Aah!

13:25.861 --> 13:28.229
Hold on.

13:32.201 --> 13:34.868
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

13:37.239 --> 13:39.405
- Jackie.
- Can I come in?

13:39.407 --> 13:41.864
Uh... yeah.

13:44.880 --> 13:47.748
Expecting company?

13:47.750 --> 13:50.322
Well, you never know when
the Dalai Lama might drop by.

13:50.325 --> 13:52.585
Um, you want a coffee?

13:52.587 --> 13:54.754
No, I'm good.

13:57.159 --> 13:59.692
Look, if this is about
Dharma and Anabel...

13:59.694 --> 14:01.594
That's not why I'm here.

14:01.596 --> 14:03.944
Okay.

14:03.947 --> 14:06.214
I need a gun.

14:06.217 --> 14:08.517
Why you come to me?

14:08.520 --> 14:11.704
I can't buy one, and Ricky
will know I took the money.

14:11.706 --> 14:14.373
Bad idea.

14:14.375 --> 14:17.442
Come on. It's a handgun.
It's not a nuclear weapon.

14:17.444 --> 14:19.679
And I won't tell Ricky
where I got it from, okay?

14:19.681 --> 14:21.580
Jackie, have you thought about this?

14:21.582 --> 14:24.283
Like, seriously thought
about it and talked to Buddha?

14:24.285 --> 14:28.353
I haven't been able to
sleep since it happened.

14:28.355 --> 14:31.356
Please, Alex.

14:31.358 --> 14:33.091
This is for my family.

14:48.981 --> 14:52.443
Hmm. Wanted to get a look at him myself.

14:55.816 --> 14:59.050
My Arabic's rusty.

14:59.052 --> 15:02.820
"I seek refuge in you from
the difficulties of affliction

15:02.822 --> 15:04.622
and the burdens of hardship,

15:04.624 --> 15:05.989
"from evil judgments,

15:05.992 --> 15:09.959
and from my enemy's
malicious rejoicing."

15:09.962 --> 15:13.163
He's begging Allah to protect him.

15:18.104 --> 15:19.903
Why is he crying?

15:19.905 --> 15:23.974
It's part of the dua...
Islamic supplication prayer.

15:23.976 --> 15:26.476
He cries to show he means it.

15:26.478 --> 15:29.579
Headquarters approved
a kill/capture mission.

15:29.581 --> 15:33.316
Make the call.

15:33.318 --> 15:35.452
I want my own assault team.

16:23.587 --> 16:25.253
Hey, Bear!

16:25.255 --> 16:27.579
Stop jerking off. We're going out, dude.

16:30.286 --> 16:31.665
Bear.

16:31.668 --> 16:33.934
Come on, dude.

16:33.937 --> 16:36.235
Hey, Bear, if you can't
get laid in this place,

16:36.238 --> 16:37.670
you have a serious problem.

16:37.673 --> 16:39.540
I thought we were
just going for a drink.

16:39.543 --> 16:41.877
Hey, we are drinking, are we not?

16:41.880 --> 16:44.639
- Here we go. Cheers, man.
- Cheers.

16:44.641 --> 16:46.641
Mm.

16:46.643 --> 16:50.445
Listen, it's time for you
to get back in the saddle.

16:50.447 --> 16:51.979
'Cause you know Lena is.

16:51.981 --> 16:53.872
No, she's not, bro.

16:53.875 --> 16:57.517
Oh, come on. The whole
"I need space" speech?

16:57.520 --> 16:59.392
Do I need to spell it out for you, man?

16:59.395 --> 17:01.688
She wants to date other people.

17:01.690 --> 17:03.657
So let's get you seeing
some other people.

17:03.659 --> 17:06.460
Maybe. Maybe.

17:11.633 --> 17:14.001
Hey.

17:14.002 --> 17:15.368
Hi.

17:15.371 --> 17:17.871
Hey, I'm, uh, I'm Joe.

17:17.873 --> 17:19.973
- That's nice.
- Yeah.

17:19.974 --> 17:21.375
Your wife let you out?

17:24.646 --> 17:27.079
Nice try.

17:27.082 --> 17:29.181
- That's fair.
- "Your wife let you out," dude?

17:29.184 --> 17:32.352
- You think that's funny?
- Jesus, Bear.

17:32.354 --> 17:35.641
It's a symbol, man. Prison of monogamy.

17:37.114 --> 17:38.690
Whoo, it's heavy.

17:38.693 --> 17:41.027
Hey, two more shots, dude.

17:41.029 --> 17:42.266
Four more shots.

17:42.269 --> 17:43.896
Four more shots. Bring us the bottle.

18:07.721 --> 18:09.187
Come on.

18:14.395 --> 18:17.329
Uhh! Come on!

18:19.222 --> 18:20.688
What is this?

18:20.691 --> 18:22.352
Oh, come on. You know
you wanna try this.

18:22.546 --> 18:24.279
- No way. Yeah?
- Trust me.

18:24.282 --> 18:25.870
Mmm.

18:25.872 --> 18:27.338
- Mmm.
- Oh!

18:27.340 --> 18:28.840
Mmm.

18:28.842 --> 18:32.444
No. No, this tastes
like spiked Kool-Aid.

18:32.446 --> 18:34.378
You can't put this in your body.

18:34.380 --> 18:36.280
Ah.

18:36.282 --> 18:40.004
So you, uh, like to
live dangerously, huh?

18:41.466 --> 18:42.966
Uh...

18:42.969 --> 18:45.970
It's okay. So do I.

18:45.973 --> 18:48.307
Let's go somewhere quieter.

18:48.310 --> 18:50.961
Some... some... somewhere
else Somewhere else?

18:50.964 --> 18:53.931
You're cute.

18:53.933 --> 18:55.915
I'll go tell my
girlfriends we're leaving.

18:55.918 --> 18:59.102
- Don't go anywhere.
- Oh, I won't.

19:00.639 --> 19:03.039
I'm... I'm not going.

19:35.507 --> 19:38.273
- Hey.
- Joe?

19:38.275 --> 19:40.175
It's Elise.

19:40.177 --> 19:42.144
Lena forgot her cellphone.

19:42.146 --> 19:44.346
Okay. Um...

19:44.348 --> 19:46.581
where'd she go?

19:46.583 --> 19:49.251
She's out.

19:49.253 --> 19:52.287
You know, it's, like,
after midnight, so...

19:52.289 --> 19:54.423
Look, Joe, I gotta go.

19:54.425 --> 19:56.158
Okay.

20:03.366 --> 20:05.879
I swear to god,

20:05.882 --> 20:07.737
if you're telling me that
you guys are sisters...

20:09.105 --> 20:11.873
Hey, Bear, open up. We got company, man.

20:13.443 --> 20:15.476
- Bear!
- Bear!

20:16.947 --> 20:19.059
Bear...

20:21.665 --> 20:24.051
I'm sorry. You guys should go.

20:24.054 --> 20:25.520
But...

20:25.522 --> 20:27.192
But...

20:27.195 --> 20:29.357
- I know, I know, I know, I know.
- We just got here.

20:29.359 --> 20:30.824
I know, I know, I know.

20:30.826 --> 20:33.561
I know, uh, but it's complicated.

20:33.563 --> 20:35.362
He's complicated.

20:35.364 --> 20:36.997
So come with us.

20:36.999 --> 20:40.668
- Mm, that's not complicated, is it?
- No.

20:40.670 --> 20:43.336
I can't.

20:43.338 --> 20:45.405
Let's go, baby.

20:45.407 --> 20:47.207
He's not coming.

20:47.209 --> 20:49.209
Oh.

20:49.211 --> 20:50.910
That's not fair.

20:50.912 --> 20:52.845
Oh, that is bad.

20:52.847 --> 20:55.648
That is bad, bad, bad Bear!

20:55.650 --> 20:57.551
Bad Bear!

20:57.553 --> 21:01.354
They're gone, thanks to you.

21:01.356 --> 21:04.757
Come on, man. Open up. I'm not
leaving till you open the door.

21:07.996 --> 21:10.362
Come on, Bear.

21:12.033 --> 21:14.767
Never leave a man behind.

21:14.769 --> 21:16.235
Hmm.

21:16.237 --> 21:19.903
That's what I always say.

21:24.278 --> 21:26.590
Come on. We got recall.

21:26.593 --> 21:28.679
I need you to sober up right now.

21:28.682 --> 21:30.416
So... your finger or mine?

21:30.418 --> 21:32.050
- Get that away from me.
- Your finger or mine? Come on.

21:32.052 --> 21:33.452
- I'm not drunk. I'll stick with coffee.
- Come on.

21:33.454 --> 21:34.920
- Okay! Okay!
- Let's see the finger!

21:34.922 --> 21:36.728
- Okay, okay, okay
- Get it done. Good boy.

21:49.202 --> 21:51.436
Please tell me that's not embalmed.

21:51.438 --> 21:53.705
No, man. Rubber cast.

21:53.707 --> 21:57.942
- Of a real finger?
- Yep. UBL's son.

21:57.944 --> 21:59.977
Had it made after I took him out.

21:59.979 --> 22:02.046
So it's like your lucky charm?

22:02.048 --> 22:05.082
Uh, "talisman" in Harvard speak.

22:05.084 --> 22:07.084
I take it with me on every op.

22:07.086 --> 22:08.953
I like to leave prints wherever I go.

22:08.955 --> 22:11.656
I got Agency turds chasing a dead man.

22:11.658 --> 22:14.439
How did we end up with
Red Squadron's trash?

22:14.442 --> 22:15.455
I don't know, man.

22:15.458 --> 22:18.294
It kind of makes sense in its
own mentally challenged way.

22:18.297 --> 22:21.265
- You're kidding.
- What, a finger, a rabbit's foot...

22:21.267 --> 22:25.302
- What's the difference?
- Uh, first off, it's not a rabbit.

22:25.304 --> 22:27.937
Okay, let's do this.
Wheel's up in 60 minutes.

22:27.939 --> 22:30.140
- Hey, anybody know where we're going?
- Yeah.

22:30.142 --> 22:31.808
Bosnia.

22:42.931 --> 22:45.265
Look who's here.

22:45.267 --> 22:46.833
Your bunk or mine, baby?

22:46.835 --> 22:48.434
Yours. Mine's too high for you.

22:48.436 --> 22:51.004
Oh, see? Our kids are
gonna be hot and funny.

22:51.006 --> 22:53.273
This is your op?

22:53.275 --> 22:56.943
Yeah, we're working together.

22:56.945 --> 22:59.678
Okay, just to be here clear,

22:59.680 --> 23:01.693
if th is gonna work,

23:01.696 --> 23:04.016
then I'm in charge of
the guys on the ground.

23:05.184 --> 23:06.701
Yeah. That's how it works.

23:06.704 --> 23:08.754
I'm just here to point
you in the right direction.

23:08.756 --> 23:12.324
And that's in the direction
of the guys who killed Rip?

23:12.326 --> 23:13.759
Yeah.

23:13.761 --> 23:16.079
Okay.

23:16.082 --> 23:18.296
HVI is Tamerlin Shishoni.

23:18.299 --> 23:20.782
That's John from Bosnia.
Thought you shot him.

23:20.785 --> 23:22.746
He survived. Went underground,

23:22.749 --> 23:24.977
became "The Prince" and
a Hall of Fame bad guy.

23:24.988 --> 23:26.750
We think he's in bed with the Russians.

23:26.753 --> 23:27.823
This guy right here is

23:27.826 --> 23:30.374
the money and muscle
behind the Ummah Movement...

23:30.377 --> 23:33.282
The Tanzania bombings, the Dubai attack,

23:33.285 --> 23:34.836
and Michael Nasry.

23:34.839 --> 23:37.948
- Yeah, where is that asshole?
- We took care of him.

23:37.951 --> 23:40.885
Look, if you guys want a shot
at the guy behind Rip's murder,

23:40.887 --> 23:44.556
the Prince is it.

23:44.558 --> 23:47.659
Great. Now we got one shot.

23:47.661 --> 23:49.994
Every year, the Prince
visits the place where

23:49.996 --> 23:53.864
his wife and kids were
massacred by the Serbs.

23:53.866 --> 23:56.567
On the anniversary of their deaths...

23:56.569 --> 23:59.403
Sarajevo, Bosnia.

23:59.405 --> 24:02.806
Here. The flower fields on
the outskirts of the city.

24:02.808 --> 24:05.719
...with a handful of
his most loyal guards

24:05.722 --> 24:07.643
and a personal driver
who's been with him

24:07.646 --> 24:09.844
since the early days of Chechnya.

24:09.847 --> 24:13.182
- They're all highly trained and...
- Not your regular mujs, I guess?

24:13.185 --> 24:15.318
No. Former Russian Spetsnaz operators.

24:15.320 --> 24:17.657
I know, guys. Been there, done that.

24:17.660 --> 24:19.427
So you know what we're up against.

24:19.430 --> 24:22.692
They'll travel in some
kind of armored convoy.

24:22.695 --> 24:25.743
And each man would give
his life for the Prince

24:25.746 --> 24:28.813
- in a heartbeat.
- This is a capture/kill mission.

24:28.816 --> 24:31.266
Preferably capture, but
I'll take him any way I can.

24:31.269 --> 24:34.000
So why don't we just drop a
couple Hellfires on target?

24:34.003 --> 24:36.003
Because we need visual
confirmation first.

24:36.006 --> 24:38.774
And how solid is the Intel?

24:38.777 --> 24:40.777
Solid.

24:46.471 --> 24:47.937
Are we gonna have a problem?

24:47.940 --> 24:49.668
Last time I heard

24:49.671 --> 24:51.520
the words credible
source" coming from you,

24:51.523 --> 24:53.589
things did not turn out well.

24:53.591 --> 24:55.858
This time, we're after the same thing.

24:55.860 --> 24:57.693
What is that?

24:57.695 --> 24:59.563
Payback.

25:03.300 --> 25:04.799
Okay.

25:36.832 --> 25:38.299
Showtime.

25:49.579 --> 25:51.979
Golf Charlie, pushing data now.

25:51.981 --> 25:54.014
Stand by.

25:55.685 --> 25:58.518
Standing by to receive traffic.

25:58.520 --> 26:02.489
Roger. Transmission received. Stand by.

26:02.491 --> 26:04.792
Okay, I need positive
IDs on all these guys.

26:04.794 --> 26:08.195
Running them through the database.

26:08.197 --> 26:10.579
Got PIDs on a bodyguard and the driver.

26:10.582 --> 26:12.782
They're tied to the
Prince's organization.

26:12.785 --> 26:15.052
What about him?

26:15.055 --> 26:16.774
Can't confirm it's the Prince.

26:16.777 --> 26:18.243
Stay on him.

26:18.246 --> 26:20.672
- Why we holding up?
- Roger that.

26:20.675 --> 26:23.643
We're waiting on a
PID of a possible HVI.

26:23.645 --> 26:26.212
We already IDed two
of his guys. It's him.

26:26.214 --> 26:28.982
Tell me about Mr. Hat and Glasses.

26:28.984 --> 26:32.051
Still no confirmation
that it's the Prince.

26:37.540 --> 26:39.224
They're rolling out.

26:42.830 --> 26:45.555
Driver's on his cell.

26:45.558 --> 26:48.260
Are we burning their phones?

26:48.263 --> 26:51.086
Yeah, the Predator's up on them.

26:51.089 --> 26:52.688
It's a number we haven't seen before,

26:52.691 --> 26:55.205
but it matches with the
others in the Prince's org.

26:58.345 --> 27:00.211
Delta One, this is Golf Charlie.

27:00.214 --> 27:01.962
We haven't IDed the HVI.

27:01.965 --> 27:06.067
- What are you thinking?
- Let's move on these assholes.

27:07.740 --> 27:11.308
We move when we know it's the Prince.

27:15.317 --> 27:17.093
They're on the move.

27:17.096 --> 27:18.696
Stay on the convoy.

27:18.698 --> 27:20.141
Hey, Delta Five, this is Delta One.

27:20.144 --> 27:22.077
Come back to the van. We're moving.

28:29.390 --> 28:30.924
Convoy stationary

28:30.926 --> 28:33.392
at what appears to be a sporting venue.

28:33.394 --> 28:36.630
Guess they're into MMA.

28:36.632 --> 28:39.032
Seven packs leaving the vehicles.

28:39.034 --> 28:41.400
Entering the south entrance of venue.

28:41.402 --> 28:44.069
Delta One, I need you to keep eyes on.

28:44.071 --> 28:47.240
Request to send personnel into venue.

28:47.242 --> 28:49.442
Roger that. Hold on.

28:51.879 --> 28:53.879
Hell, we can get in there.

28:53.881 --> 28:55.381
We can try, anyway.

28:56.984 --> 28:59.317
Trevor, Caulder, you're up.

28:59.319 --> 29:02.821
I'm going with them.

29:02.823 --> 29:06.049
I'm the only one who's ever seen
this asshole Shishoni in person.

29:06.052 --> 29:08.460
I have a better shot
at IDing him, right?

29:08.462 --> 29:09.995
Just don't get burned, all right?

29:09.997 --> 29:12.064
This is turning into a shitshow, dude.

29:12.066 --> 29:15.400
- Could be worse, fellas.
- How so?

29:15.402 --> 29:18.736
Could be boxing.

29:30.583 --> 29:33.184
We got Delta Two,

29:33.186 --> 29:37.588
Three, and Four entering
west entrance of venue.

30:02.094 --> 30:04.061
Yo, you think that's him?

30:05.550 --> 30:07.217
Can't tell.

30:07.219 --> 30:09.820
What, you don't
recognize the douchey hat?

30:17.062 --> 30:18.795
This is Delta One.

30:18.797 --> 30:22.131
We have eyes on targets.
No PID on our HVI.

30:45.056 --> 30:46.856
I'm about to piss myself.

30:46.858 --> 30:50.692
- Well, hold it.
- I have been since we got here.

30:50.694 --> 30:52.728
Mind over body, man. Stay here.

30:52.730 --> 30:55.731
Jesus, man. I'll be right back.

31:25.795 --> 31:27.628
Go after him?

31:27.630 --> 31:30.931
Give it a minute.

31:49.885 --> 31:51.420
_

31:51.662 --> 31:54.966
_

32:08.337 --> 32:10.637
Shit. They went in right
after you. Did they make you?

32:10.639 --> 32:13.072
We might be burned.

32:29.690 --> 32:32.458
Shit.

32:32.460 --> 32:34.860
This is Delta One.

32:34.862 --> 32:36.995
Our guys might be compromised.

32:48.342 --> 32:50.342
They're exiting through the back door.

32:50.344 --> 32:52.643
We'll be in the alley
in less than one mike.

33:12.732 --> 33:14.899
Hey.

33:14.901 --> 33:18.335
Potential HVI just split
off with the bodyguard.

33:23.809 --> 33:26.565
This is Delta One.
Group has split in two

33:26.568 --> 33:28.737
with possible principal
targets still internal.

33:28.740 --> 33:29.846
Rest of the group

33:29.848 --> 33:31.982
is exiting on the south side.

33:31.984 --> 33:34.051
Positive ID on the HVI?

33:34.053 --> 33:36.053
Negative.

33:37.523 --> 33:39.355
Recommend you execute.

33:39.357 --> 33:41.260
While most of the crowd is still inside.

33:41.263 --> 33:42.963
We haven't IDed him.

33:42.966 --> 33:44.260
I know,

33:44.262 --> 33:46.530
but this is as good
as it's going to get.

33:48.434 --> 33:50.366
Definitely a shitshow.

33:50.368 --> 33:51.935
Possible collateral damage, Bear.

33:51.937 --> 33:53.703
We can abort.

33:56.574 --> 33:58.615
Let's go.

34:00.621 --> 34:02.344
Let's go.

35:44.521 --> 35:46.756
Uhh!

36:04.742 --> 36:07.439
All right, bring it in. Load 'em up.

36:10.546 --> 36:12.747
Where are you?

36:12.749 --> 36:15.084
Potential HVI and
bodyguards are headed to...

36:15.087 --> 36:19.053
South exit. You okay?

36:19.055 --> 36:20.554
Yeah.

36:28.665 --> 36:31.165
Uhh!

36:32.968 --> 36:35.068
Ah!

36:43.012 --> 36:44.477
Ah!

36:53.689 --> 36:56.623
Blue, blue!

36:56.625 --> 36:59.159
- Blue, blue, blue!
- Ah!

37:04.533 --> 37:06.299
Blue! Blue!

37:17.045 --> 37:20.012
This him?

37:20.014 --> 37:22.715
- I don't think so.
- Caulder's hit!

37:22.717 --> 37:25.684
Okay, take him to
Cline. Have her ID him.

37:31.525 --> 37:32.991
That guy.

37:43.181 --> 37:45.637
It's not him.

37:45.639 --> 37:47.573
I hope your guy's doing okay.

38:02.756 --> 38:05.056
I'm not getting on in plane, Bear.

38:05.058 --> 38:07.454
- Bear, it is a scratch, man. It's nothing.
- No, not again.

38:07.457 --> 38:09.093
Look, I told you
there's a team of people

38:09.095 --> 38:10.561
waiting for you in Landstuhl.

38:10.563 --> 38:12.530
That's not gonna happen. Drop it.

38:12.532 --> 38:14.164
Okay?

38:14.166 --> 38:16.279
- You're overreacting.
- Yeah, well, that's... Yeah.

38:16.282 --> 38:18.378
Look, I would like
somebody other than Trevor

38:18.381 --> 38:19.873
to take a look at your arm.

38:19.876 --> 38:23.173
All right?

38:23.175 --> 38:26.110
Okay, we're gonna be waitin'
for him when you get home.

38:26.112 --> 38:28.112
It's gonna be all good.

38:28.114 --> 38:31.882
All right? You got this.

38:49.902 --> 38:53.236
You said your Intel was reliable.

38:53.238 --> 38:55.638
This is the second goddamn time.

38:55.640 --> 38:59.242
Somebody lied to me.

39:09.254 --> 39:12.271
Yo, having that shit on your
phone will get you bounced, bro.

39:12.274 --> 39:14.289
Oh, like I'm the only one?

39:15.759 --> 39:19.894
I saw you, dude. You like this shit.

39:19.897 --> 39:22.837
We all do, man. You just gotta own it.

39:36.182 --> 39:38.375
_

39:38.376 --> 39:40.485
_

39:41.629 --> 39:43.617
_

39:47.260 --> 39:49.306
_

39:50.555 --> 39:52.501

39:56.306 --> 39:58.282

39:59.821 --> 40:02.032

40:02.567 --> 40:03.939

40:05.962 --> 40:07.657
_

40:11.784 --> 40:15.376
_

40:31.834 --> 40:33.567
"I seek refuge..."

40:46.981 --> 40:49.215
"...and the difficulty of affliction..."

41:00.327 --> 41:02.929
"...from the burden of hardship..."

41:13.707 --> 41:16.442
"...from evil judgment..."

41:31.532 --> 41:34.391
"...and from my enemy's
malicious rejoicing."

41:44.136 --> 41:46.369
Allahu Akbar.
