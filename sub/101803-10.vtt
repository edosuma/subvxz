11:01.486 --> 11:03.706
We can't afford to lose
a potential ally.

11:03.750 --> 11:04.925
Well, I prefer people that shoot

11:04.968 --> 11:06.535
in the same direction
as me, so...

11:06.578 --> 11:08.189
I know chain of command
means nothing to you,

11:08.232 --> 11:10.104
but Captain Lindell
has influence.

11:10.147 --> 11:12.280
And from what I can tell,
you need all the help
you can get, Master Chief.

11:12.323 --> 11:14.717
Please, call me Jason.Negative.

11:14.761 --> 11:16.240
I'll call you Master Chief Hayes

11:16.284 --> 11:18.025
and you'll call me
Lieutenant Commander Williams

11:18.068 --> 11:19.679
because this
is the United States Navy.

11:22.725 --> 11:25.075
So, where are we?

11:27.208 --> 11:29.036
The prosecution thinks
it has ironclad evidence

11:29.079 --> 11:30.472
you shot an unarmed man.

11:30.515 --> 11:32.822
What evidence? He had a gun.

11:32.866 --> 11:35.216
We'll learn more at
the preliminary hearing later.Good.

11:35.259 --> 11:37.522
It's time we start pushing back.No.

11:37.566 --> 11:39.394
There's nothing for us to do
at the hearing but listen.

11:39.437 --> 11:41.352
The prosecution's evidence
will be reviewed

11:41.396 --> 11:43.441
by an investigating officer
who will recommend

11:43.485 --> 11:45.835
the case be thrown out,
amended and/or go to trial.

11:45.879 --> 11:47.750
Please try to control yourself
in the hearing

11:47.794 --> 11:49.143
so I only have to fight
the prosecution.

11:49.186 --> 11:50.797
You know, it is odd to me.

11:50.840 --> 11:53.669
It's odd to me that you've never
asked me how this all went down.

11:53.713 --> 11:56.324
I mean, do you think I'm,
what, some kind of trigger-happy

11:56.367 --> 11:59.327
renegade who shoots anyone
in their crosshairs?

11:59.370 --> 12:00.981
It's my job to defend you
no matter what I think.

12:01.024 --> 12:02.069
I arrived
on target.

12:02.112 --> 12:03.418
I saw a man

12:03.461 --> 12:05.768
holding a Beretta M1951
in his left hand.

12:05.812 --> 12:08.684
I put him down
before he could get a shot off.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.773
I'm far less concerned
with what you say happened

12:10.817 --> 12:13.036
than with what
the prosecution can prove.

12:13.080 --> 12:15.038
Unless you can procure
the smoking gun,

12:15.082 --> 12:17.606
it's your word against theirs,
Master Chief.

12:21.218 --> 12:23.525
Oh, hey there, little buddy.

12:23.568 --> 12:25.832
You, uh, shooting your feelings
again there, sugarplum?

12:25.875 --> 12:27.529
Uh, JAG called
before I fired

12:27.572 --> 12:28.530
a shot.

12:28.573 --> 12:31.185
Deposition is in ten minutes.

12:31.228 --> 12:33.187
When's yours?

12:33.230 --> 12:34.841
Uh, my deposition
got rescheduled.

12:34.884 --> 12:35.885
Ray called me in.

12:35.929 --> 12:37.713
Oh. What,
something going on?

12:37.757 --> 12:39.236
[lock beeping]

12:40.498 --> 12:41.543
Yo.

12:41.586 --> 12:43.023
We're spinning
up, Spenser.

12:43.066 --> 12:45.025
I thought we were undeployable.

12:45.068 --> 12:48.071
Bravo's undeployable, but you
and Ray are strapping with Echo.

12:48.115 --> 12:49.507
They need sniper support,

12:49.551 --> 12:50.726
and the other teams
are engaged elsewhere.

12:50.770 --> 12:52.510
Still need rear security.

12:52.554 --> 12:53.816
Sonny's here
and cleared hot.

12:53.860 --> 12:55.383
[grunts]About time he knocks
the rust off.

12:55.426 --> 12:57.689
That was quick.

12:58.473 --> 13:00.562
I'll leave you to it.

13:02.259 --> 13:03.870
I don't have to remind you
that there are

13:03.913 --> 13:07.699
plenty of eyes on you, given
Master Chief Hayes' situation.

13:07.743 --> 13:08.962
Toe the line.

13:09.005 --> 13:10.746
Roger.

13:12.966 --> 13:14.489
CLAY:
Sonny Quinn rides again.

13:14.532 --> 13:16.230
SONNY:
Couldn't stand to be

13:16.273 --> 13:17.840
away another day.

13:17.884 --> 13:20.190
Treated me like a lab rat
when I was out, but...

13:20.234 --> 13:21.757
no one questions
where your head's at.

13:21.801 --> 13:23.846
[chuckles]: Yeah.
I don't think the Navy wants

13:23.890 --> 13:25.065
to go down that rabbit hole.

13:25.108 --> 13:27.589
Uh, I'm good,
Ray. Lookit.

13:27.632 --> 13:29.504
My injury was a
small price to pay

13:29.547 --> 13:32.202
for slaying
your dragon.

13:32.246 --> 13:33.943
Hope Jace doesn't pay
a bigger one.

13:33.987 --> 13:36.032
His charges have nothing
to do with Raqqa Jacques.

13:36.076 --> 13:38.078
So, where we headed?

13:38.121 --> 13:39.514
Apartadó, Colombia.

13:39.557 --> 13:41.255
Targeting four key leaders
of Las Sombras.

13:41.298 --> 13:44.040
That's the most brutal cartel
in the region.

13:44.084 --> 13:46.129
Five points for Blonde Hermione.

13:46.173 --> 13:48.523
Is this a kill
or capture mission?

13:48.566 --> 13:49.567
Kill.

13:49.611 --> 13:51.656
We're responsible
for taking out

13:51.700 --> 13:54.659
the cartel's third in command,
Mauricio Perez... [grunts]

13:54.703 --> 13:56.270
...while Echo
simultaneously eliminates

13:56.313 --> 13:57.314
the other four targets.

13:57.358 --> 13:58.968
Wheels up in an hour.

13:59.012 --> 14:01.623
Doesn't leave much time for
your deposition there, Sonny.

14:01.666 --> 14:03.407
Gonna keep it fast and dirty.

14:03.451 --> 14:06.193
'Cause they can't handle
my truth.

14:08.325 --> 14:10.632
Hey, how's, uh,
how's Jace holding up?

14:10.675 --> 14:12.764
[grunts]
Haven't heard anything.

14:12.808 --> 14:13.853
[grunts]

14:14.854 --> 14:16.507
You didn't reach out?

14:16.551 --> 14:19.684
Seem to recall Command
issuing a no-contact order.

14:19.728 --> 14:22.035
I figured maybe you'd bend
the rules a little bit

14:22.078 --> 14:23.688
for your best friend.

14:23.732 --> 14:25.299
I can't imagine
it's easy on him,

14:25.342 --> 14:27.127
being
without his brothers.

14:27.170 --> 14:29.564
Well, it's
unfortunate, but...

14:29.607 --> 14:31.218
sometimes you're
on your own.

14:31.261 --> 14:32.828
Come on.

14:32.872 --> 14:34.525
[grunts]

14:35.526 --> 14:36.963
OGAWA:
Good afternoon.

14:37.006 --> 14:38.965
I'm Commander Ogawa.
I've been assigned to conduct

14:39.008 --> 14:40.967
the preliminary hearing
for United States

14:41.010 --> 14:43.491
v. Master Chief Jason Hayes.

14:43.534 --> 14:46.015
Is the government prepared
to present evidence?

14:46.059 --> 14:47.756
FLORES:
Yes, ma'am.

14:50.715 --> 14:53.980
Master Chief Hayes is accused
of violating Article 119,

14:54.023 --> 14:56.852
involuntary manslaughter,
for shooting Yazeed Nafal,

14:56.896 --> 15:00.682
an unarmed Jordanian civilian,
during an operation in Jordan.

15:00.725 --> 15:02.162
Exhibit 1 is the
classified order

15:02.205 --> 15:05.513
to obtain the cell phone
of Syrian terrorist Dabir Ganim.

15:05.556 --> 15:07.341
Exhibit 2 is the
deposed testimony

15:07.384 --> 15:09.125
of three members of Bravo Team.

15:09.169 --> 15:11.301
Exhibit 3:

15:11.345 --> 15:13.390
cell phone footage
of the shooting.

15:23.574 --> 15:25.576
[gunshots][groaning]

15:34.977 --> 15:36.239
[gunshots]

15:36.283 --> 15:37.762
As the
footage shows,

15:37.806 --> 15:39.851
Mr. Nafal
had no weapon.

15:39.895 --> 15:43.464
Master Chief Hayes
fatally shot an unarmed man.

15:49.600 --> 15:51.994
I'm telling you, Mr. Nafal
was armed, 'kay?

15:52.038 --> 15:53.126
Video says differently.

15:53.169 --> 15:54.605
Forget the video,
all right?

15:54.649 --> 15:56.303
The video had missing
camera angles.

15:56.346 --> 15:58.044
It didn't-didn't show
everything.

15:58.087 --> 15:59.262
So where's the gun?

15:59.306 --> 16:00.263
It wasn't
at the scene.

16:00.307 --> 16:01.569
None of your teammates
saw it.

16:01.612 --> 16:03.484
Seems it only exists
in your head.

16:03.527 --> 16:05.268
The gun was there.
All right?

16:05.312 --> 16:06.922
Maybe a cop took it
or a neighbor.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.619
So, I don't know,
how do we prove it?

16:08.663 --> 16:11.144
We don't.What do you mean
we don't? That's it?

16:11.187 --> 16:13.059
Plea offer.

16:13.102 --> 16:14.930
You admit to Article 114,

16:14.974 --> 16:17.237
reckless endangerment, accept a
less than honorable discharge...[scoffs]

16:17.280 --> 16:19.587
...but you get to keep some of
your benefits.
You got to be
kidding me. Plea deal.

16:19.630 --> 16:21.415
I'm not taking a plea deal.Taking that deal is
your best hope for a future.

16:21.458 --> 16:22.546
I take that deal,

16:22.590 --> 16:24.026
all that says is
that I'm guilty.

16:24.070 --> 16:25.636
I'm not guilty. I'm innocent.

16:25.680 --> 16:28.639
20 years of service to
this country should prove that.

16:29.901 --> 16:32.774
It's true many people think
you're a hero, Master Chief.

16:32.817 --> 16:34.863
But that video says
you're a cold-blooded killer.

16:34.906 --> 16:37.039
It's a generous
plea offer.

16:37.083 --> 16:39.041
It proves the U.S. wants
a speedy settlement with Jordan.

16:39.085 --> 16:40.129
All it proves

16:40.173 --> 16:41.522
is they want this to go away.

16:41.565 --> 16:42.958
They're not expecting a fight.

16:43.002 --> 16:44.699
This isn't your kind of fight,
Master Chief.

16:44.742 --> 16:46.353
There are
greater forces at play.

16:46.396 --> 16:47.397
If you're
court-martialed,

16:47.441 --> 16:49.312
your entire life will be invaded

16:49.356 --> 16:50.879
and you'll face
a more severe punishment

16:50.922 --> 16:51.923
than what's
in that offer.

16:51.967 --> 16:54.056
No. Not gonna take the plea.

16:54.100 --> 16:56.841
Think of what you're risking
by going to trial.

16:56.885 --> 16:58.060
Risk is part of my job.

16:58.104 --> 16:59.844
Take the deal.
It's your only way out.

16:59.888 --> 17:01.281
No.

17:01.324 --> 17:05.198
There is more
than my freedom at stake here.

17:07.243 --> 17:09.245
Never out of the fight.

17:10.072 --> 17:11.769
That's right. That's me.

17:15.164 --> 17:17.688
We'll review every piece of
evidence and every tactic again.

17:17.732 --> 17:18.776
Good.

17:18.820 --> 17:20.691
Now I feel
like we're communicating.

17:21.866 --> 17:23.346
Sit down.

17:23.390 --> 17:25.783
I'm not banging my head
against the wall alone, Jason.

17:28.221 --> 17:29.657
Yes, ma'am.

17:29.700 --> 17:32.312
Or is it "Lieutenant Commander
Williams" now?

17:34.488 --> 17:36.707
[indistinct chatter]

17:40.059 --> 17:41.886
[quietly]:
Oh, God.

17:42.887 --> 17:43.975
What's the matter?

17:44.019 --> 17:45.629
Realizing how dull

17:45.673 --> 17:47.544
life will be with Echo?[chuckles]

17:47.588 --> 17:49.546
I'm realizing how wrong it feels
to be rolling out

17:49.590 --> 17:51.592
with Jason's career on the line.

17:51.635 --> 17:53.333
Our depositions will help.

17:53.376 --> 17:55.248
All right? Get on record what
kind of man and operator he is.

17:55.291 --> 17:56.814
SONNY:
Not sure

17:56.858 --> 17:57.989
how much, though.

17:58.033 --> 17:59.861
All they were worried about

17:59.904 --> 18:01.732
was the missing gun.

18:02.777 --> 18:05.475
If only I would've gone inside,
maybe I would've spotted it.

18:05.519 --> 18:07.347
Could've made this all go away.

18:07.390 --> 18:09.044
SONNY:
If they didn't take
Jason's word for it,

18:09.088 --> 18:11.177
what makes you think
they're gonna take yours?

18:11.220 --> 18:14.354
The only reason the pencil
jockeys are questioning the kill

18:14.397 --> 18:15.529
is because it happened

18:15.572 --> 18:17.139
inside an apartment building

18:17.183 --> 18:18.749
and not in the sandbox.

18:18.793 --> 18:21.230
Cake-eaters still think
this war's got boundaries.

18:22.579 --> 18:24.712
I never should've
told Jason that...

18:24.755 --> 18:26.148
Raqqa Jacques
was Ray's torturer.

18:26.192 --> 18:29.151
I mean, what if I primed him
to make a mistake?

18:29.195 --> 18:31.806
He didn't make
a mistake. Okay?

18:31.849 --> 18:33.895
Ain't no reason
to feel guilty.

18:33.938 --> 18:35.157
Raqqa Jacques

18:35.201 --> 18:36.463
come up in your deposition?

18:36.506 --> 18:38.639
No. Why would he?

18:38.682 --> 18:41.424
Wouldn't have
changed the op.

18:42.686 --> 18:43.731
Hey.

18:43.774 --> 18:45.559
How'd your deposition go,
Warrant?

18:46.951 --> 18:48.039
Not supposed to talk

18:48.083 --> 18:49.780
about the investigation.

18:50.520 --> 18:52.174
Mm. He's just...

18:52.218 --> 18:53.480
he's just worried about Jace.

18:53.523 --> 18:55.569
Or himself.

18:56.396 --> 18:57.571
He was OIC
in Jordan.

18:57.614 --> 19:00.400
Means he's exposed.

19:00.443 --> 19:02.445
He'll be on the hook
for Jason's actions.

19:02.489 --> 19:04.186
No, he's just wound up.

19:04.230 --> 19:06.406
There's no way in hell

19:06.449 --> 19:09.409
he's more concerned
about his situation

19:09.452 --> 19:11.106
than his brother's.

19:11.150 --> 19:12.847
DAVIS:
Yeah. I agree.

19:12.890 --> 19:14.675
His first op out,
he nearly got killed.

19:14.718 --> 19:17.068
His second time out, Jason's
freedom's in the crosshairs.

19:17.895 --> 19:20.898
He's got plenty
weighing on him.

19:23.640 --> 19:25.251
WILLIAMS:
We've combed
through everything.

19:25.294 --> 19:27.078
AARs, Jordan's
records.

19:27.862 --> 19:29.342
I'm not finding our Hail Mary.

19:29.385 --> 19:32.127
You sure we just can't
tell 'em I didn't do it?

19:32.171 --> 19:34.042
[chuckles]

19:42.268 --> 19:44.400
Chief Warrant Officer Perry.

19:44.444 --> 19:46.097
His deposition's sealed.

19:46.141 --> 19:47.577
So?

19:47.621 --> 19:49.536
So, he has a lawyer, too.

19:49.579 --> 19:51.625
Why does he need a lawyer?

19:51.668 --> 19:53.844
Maybe to protect
himself.

19:53.888 --> 19:55.150
How would you describe
his mental state

19:55.194 --> 19:56.804
on the Jordan mission?

19:57.587 --> 19:59.589
He was fine.But could he
really serve

19:59.633 --> 20:02.288
as a solid OIC just weeks
