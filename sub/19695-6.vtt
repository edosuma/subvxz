00:00.013 --> 00:01.519
Previously on "Shades of Blue"...

00:01.553 --> 00:03.715
The Internal Affairs guy's
back, taking up residence.

00:03.749 --> 00:05.080
Verco found the freezer

00:05.108 --> 00:06.516
I think he's squeezing one of the crew.

00:06.540 --> 00:07.895
You can play all
the mind games you want.

00:07.919 --> 00:09.479
It doesn't change the fact
that I'm a good cop.

00:09.503 --> 00:10.894
Well, ask what you want
about Donnie Pomp,

00:10.918 --> 00:11.993
and let's get this over with.

00:12.017 --> 00:13.416
The DEA money that was stolen

00:13.450 --> 00:14.436
in the armored truck heist

00:14.470 --> 00:15.759
just showed up at the scene of a bust.

00:15.783 --> 00:17.727
Apparently Donnie Pomp is out there

00:17.754 --> 00:19.488
spending our hard-earned, stolen cash.

00:19.523 --> 00:21.657
Lying to the FBI is a felony.

00:21.692 --> 00:23.326
You told Espada that Donnie's the one

00:23.360 --> 00:24.727
who put it back into circulation.

00:24.761 --> 00:26.272
You and I both know that's impossible.

00:26.296 --> 00:27.930
I was your mom's training officer.

00:27.964 --> 00:28.798
My name's Caddie.

00:28.832 --> 00:30.833
Do you want to leave a message for her?

00:30.867 --> 00:31.934
Delivery, actually.

00:31.968 --> 00:33.502
You've changed the game, Harlee.

00:33.537 --> 00:35.938
Nothing is off-limits now.

00:35.972 --> 00:37.540
You don't have to stay for this.

00:37.574 --> 00:40.176
A young woman
took a single GSW to the head.

00:40.210 --> 00:41.877
The victim was engaged to James Nava.

00:41.912 --> 00:42.812
When was the last time you saw her?

00:42.846 --> 00:44.680
Last night. She came to my apartment.

00:44.715 --> 00:46.182
I need you to stay away from me.

00:46.216 --> 00:48.684
Caroline was killed with my gun.

00:48.719 --> 00:52.221
When I find the guy
that did this to you,

00:52.255 --> 00:53.856
I'm not gonna call the cops.

00:53.890 --> 00:55.934
Now, that clip of yours holds what?

00:56.760 --> 00:58.427
Nine, minus the one.

00:58.462 --> 00:59.895
That leaves a lot more bullets.

01:09.339 --> 01:10.706
What is obsession?

01:10.741 --> 01:15.945
I mean, what is obsession?

01:16.551 --> 01:18.280
Infatuation?

01:19.750 --> 01:21.384
Lust?

01:21.418 --> 01:23.419
Delusion?

01:23.453 --> 01:26.889
Something we must consume?

01:26.923 --> 01:32.795
Something, someone that consumes us?

01:32.829 --> 01:35.831
To me, obsession is

01:35.866 --> 01:37.633
an occupation.

01:38.063 --> 01:41.237
It's a relentless occupation of my mind.

01:41.584 --> 01:45.674
And sometimes I welcome that occupation.

01:45.709 --> 01:49.539
Other times that occupation
takes my mind by force.

01:50.379 --> 01:52.648
You ever see those stories,
those news stories?

01:52.682 --> 01:55.785
People... they ignore storm warnings.

01:56.231 --> 01:58.378
And they just walk to the beach,

01:58.412 --> 02:01.590
like, almost expecting, hoping

02:01.625 --> 02:04.097
a tidal wave is gonna hit?

02:04.961 --> 02:08.351
I used to wonder,
what is wrong with them?

02:08.965 --> 02:10.866
Listen to the warning.

02:10.901 --> 02:14.089
Walk away. Be smart.

02:19.876 --> 02:21.944
I get why people are drawn to the shore.

02:21.978 --> 02:23.155
I get why.

02:23.814 --> 02:25.848
They can't turn away
from the wall of water

02:25.882 --> 02:27.883
that's headed right for them...

02:27.918 --> 02:29.835
because the wave is beautiful.

02:30.854 --> 02:33.789
It's intoxicating.

02:33.824 --> 02:36.170
It's seductive.

02:36.893 --> 02:38.861
It's the living embodiment of danger.

02:46.359 --> 02:48.003
Ten minutes.

02:48.038 --> 02:49.619
He'll show.

02:50.740 --> 02:53.538
Nothing good happens
in the woods after midnight.

02:54.203 --> 02:58.447
Julia set the meet. We're solid.

03:00.851 --> 03:02.918
Was that Linda's car
I saw in the driveway?

03:02.953 --> 03:05.243
Don't uncork the champagne.

03:05.956 --> 03:08.651
She needs a fan belt fixed.

03:09.832 --> 03:11.700
Have you asked her to come home?

03:11.928 --> 03:13.996
She said all of ten words,

03:14.030 --> 03:16.926
four of them being, "Fix my fan belt."

03:17.968 --> 03:19.155
You know, she's not the one

03:19.190 --> 03:20.734
who needs to do the talking.

03:27.978 --> 03:30.614
You got to believe
that there's a path back.

03:32.246 --> 03:34.337
It runs through...

03:34.985 --> 03:36.952
rough terrain.

03:41.958 --> 03:44.026
And here we go.

03:47.664 --> 03:50.032
Did Julia negotiate a procedure here?

03:50.066 --> 03:52.801
Procedure is get your gun.

03:56.773 --> 03:58.774
And that moment on the shore

03:58.808 --> 04:01.544
is a chance to flirt with fate...

04:04.603 --> 04:06.582
See if you can stand your ground,

04:06.616 --> 04:09.104
dare danger to come after you,

04:09.753 --> 04:11.887
look it in the face and say,

04:11.922 --> 04:14.023
"I can control you."

04:14.524 --> 04:16.240
"I can best you."

04:17.761 --> 04:20.728
"And I can make you bend to my will."

04:23.700 --> 04:25.633
Good evening, detectives.

04:27.037 --> 04:30.105
Put the gun back
where you found it by morning.

04:30.528 --> 04:32.908
He gets right to it, doesn't he?

04:32.943 --> 04:35.984
He isn't the in habit
of returning seized contraband.

04:36.947 --> 04:40.583
I'm not in the habit
of negotiating with dirty cops

04:40.617 --> 04:42.985
unless it's to procure services.

04:43.019 --> 04:44.086
Two weeks grace period.

04:44.120 --> 04:46.755
We allow you to operate
your money-laundering scheme

04:46.790 --> 04:47.934
out of the pool hall in our backyard

04:47.958 --> 04:49.765
until you find a new location.

04:50.727 --> 04:53.862
And then I suggest
we give each other a wide berth.

04:53.897 --> 04:56.098
I believe you invaded my space first.

04:56.132 --> 04:58.467
And you got payback.

04:58.501 --> 04:59.651
The game's a draw.

04:59.686 --> 05:00.712
No.

05:00.746 --> 05:03.973
I still have that important
piece of yours in play.

05:04.007 --> 05:08.110
We'll absolve you from the hit
that you did on that girl.

05:08.144 --> 05:09.966
Well, then...

05:14.791 --> 05:17.993
I think we're close to an agreement.

05:18.636 --> 05:22.791
I just need that small piece
of information...

05:22.826 --> 05:26.795
the anonymous tip
that brought you to my door.

05:26.830 --> 05:28.163
Look, we didn't know

05:28.198 --> 05:29.916
you were friends with the councilwoman.

05:30.533 --> 05:31.800
Now we understand.

05:31.835 --> 05:34.477
I'm glad we're all friends.

05:35.171 --> 05:37.740
So then tell me, friends,

05:37.774 --> 05:39.875
who put you up to framing me?

05:39.909 --> 05:41.539
End this now.

05:42.012 --> 05:45.014
Or I promise you and your men

05:45.048 --> 05:48.250
are gonna drown in bullets and blue.

05:57.794 --> 06:01.897
I get a name,
or the bodies keep dropping.

06:07.203 --> 06:09.004
I fail.

06:09.039 --> 06:12.007
Every time I tell myself
that I don't need the rush,

06:12.042 --> 06:13.909
that I can control...

06:13.943 --> 06:15.277
that I can fight temptation,

06:15.311 --> 06:18.598
that I can control my desire,

06:19.616 --> 06:21.007
I...

06:21.526 --> 06:23.878
I-I-I fail.

06:24.888 --> 06:28.957
I can't stop my feet
moving toward the shore.

06:36.966 --> 06:38.242
Anyway...

06:40.136 --> 06:42.071
thanks for letting me share.

06:50.513 --> 06:51.913
Thank you, Sam.

06:52.082 --> 06:54.393
The first time's always the hardest.

07:04.013 --> 07:05.579
It's a nice way to start the day.

07:05.614 --> 07:07.821
What can I help you with?

07:09.050 --> 07:10.477
You ever seen these two guys?

07:11.437 --> 07:14.082
If I report my gun stolen,
worst-case scenario,

07:14.117 --> 07:15.325
I get fired.

07:15.957 --> 07:18.793
Worst-case scenario
is another body drops,

07:18.827 --> 07:21.796
and your report looks like
a half-baked alibi.

07:29.004 --> 07:31.071
You should get some sleep.

07:31.106 --> 07:32.807
We'd all be sleeping easier

07:32.841 --> 07:35.743
if we just gave Bianchi
the name he's looking for.

07:35.777 --> 07:37.444
Woz, we can't.

07:37.479 --> 07:39.647
We even whisper Stahl's name to Bianchi,

07:39.681 --> 07:41.058
the Feds' investigation goes belly up,

07:41.082 --> 07:42.616
and you and the crew get rounded up.

07:42.651 --> 07:45.812
That's a tomorrow problem.

07:46.855 --> 07:50.604
Today we got to focus on
taking Bianchi's leverage away.

07:51.626 --> 07:53.494
I doubt he's playing
hot potato with my gun.

07:53.528 --> 07:55.729
He probably has
a designated shooter on standby.

07:55.764 --> 07:56.997
Then back to the morgue...

07:57.411 --> 08:00.315
whoever killed Caroline has your gun.

08:01.102 --> 08:03.671
And the best way
to find a murder weapon...

08:03.705 --> 08:05.105
Solve the murder.

08:09.520 --> 08:11.963
Funny how they always have
that same expression.

08:12.389 --> 08:14.757
"Thank you for putting me
out of my misery"?

08:14.792 --> 08:16.526
"I've got a secret."

08:16.560 --> 08:18.394
It's usually who killed them.

08:18.429 --> 08:19.696
Yeah, it feels like yesterday

08:19.730 --> 08:21.431
I was asked to keep that secret on ice.

08:21.465 --> 08:22.999
Turns out we're on a clock.

08:23.033 --> 08:24.534
We got to find Bianchi's triggerman

08:24.568 --> 08:26.369
before he kills again.

08:26.403 --> 08:27.547
You two ever gonna tell me what you did

08:27.571 --> 08:30.506
to piss off this overstuffed cannoli?

08:30.541 --> 08:34.277
Someday. Not today.

08:34.311 --> 08:35.589
Since I don't deal in tarot cards,

08:35.613 --> 08:36.690
there's not much I can tell you.

08:36.714 --> 08:38.414
We just need a place to start.

08:38.448 --> 08:39.749
Usual suspects are no help...

08:39.783 --> 08:41.851
no ballistics match, no fingerprints,

08:41.885 --> 08:43.019
no trace evidence.

08:43.053 --> 08:44.554
So you got nothing?

08:44.588 --> 08:46.222
Not much isn't nothing.

08:46.256 --> 08:48.224
There's semen present in the body.

08:48.258 --> 08:51.894
No signs of sexual assault,
probably consensual.

08:53.430 --> 08:54.897
Was there a match in the system?

08:54.932 --> 08:55.965
So far, no.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.602
Based on specimen life span,
the departed Ms. Winston

08:59.637 --> 09:02.538
had intercourse within
eight hours of her death.

09:02.573 --> 09:04.774
If you'll excuse me,
I have three more autopsies.

09:08.012 --> 09:10.580
So this boyfriend of yours
was either screwing his ex,

09:10.614 --> 09:12.782
or someone else saw her
before the hit man got to her.

09:12.816 --> 09:14.550
Go talk to Nava.

09:14.585 --> 09:16.252
It's got to be you.

09:16.286 --> 09:17.453
Ask him if he was with her.

09:17.488 --> 09:20.590
Look, even if it's a yes,
we all know he didn't kill her.

09:20.624 --> 09:23.918
But you'll know if he's lying
or if we have a lead.

09:24.428 --> 09:26.062
We'll stay out of the line of fire.

09:26.096 --> 09:28.631
Meet you at the precinct.

09:31.335 --> 09:34.303
As kids, all we had was each other.

09:35.639 --> 09:37.573
Wallace, being the older brother,

09:37.608 --> 09:40.643
he, always looked after me.

09:40.678 --> 09:42.512
He was my dragon slayer.

09:42.546 --> 09:46.082
And in my neighborhood,
they had a whole lot of dragons.

09:46.116 --> 09:49.619
You know, I've been thinking
a lot about family

09:49.653 --> 09:51.638
and loyalty lately...

09:52.656 --> 09:54.503
how important they are...

09:56.126 --> 09:58.255
how fragile they are.

09:58.996 --> 10:01.631
And I think it's about damn time
I pick up a sword

10:01.665 --> 10:03.141
for my brother.

10:03.834 --> 10:05.968
So I will make you this vow.

10:07.671 --> 10:09.372
If you let Wallace out,

10:09.406 --> 10:11.808
I promise he will never be
back in here again.

10:14.645 --> 10:17.772
Parole is about second chances, right?

10:18.682 --> 10:21.617
I'm asking you to give me
a second chance

10:22.419 --> 10:24.120
to be a better brother.

10:27.591 --> 10:28.991
Thank you, Detective.

10:29.026 --> 10:31.828
We'll notify you
once we've made our decision.

10:39.703 --> 10:40.970
Detective?

10:57.921 --> 11:00.556
I know you're not happy
we're rescheduling.

11:00.591 --> 11:03.159
I have to attend a funereal that day.

11:03.193 --> 11:06.529
I got to go.

11:06.563 --> 11:08.531
I thought you might call in sick today.

11:08.565 --> 11:10.366
Starting a trial on a domestic violence.

11:10.400 --> 11:12.932
My witness is skittish.
I need to be here.

11:13.737 --> 11:15.671
Can I walk with you?

11:17.574 --> 11:19.889
It's about Caroline's case.

11:20.444 --> 11:22.044
Did you find something?

11:22.079 --> 11:25.581
No, but the medical examiner did.

11:25.616 --> 11:27.717
Something in the autopsy?

11:29.770 --> 11:32.410
There's evidence that Caroline...

11:33.957 --> 11:36.893
was with someone
in the hours before her death.

11:36.927 --> 11:38.528
"With someone"?

11:51.008 --> 11:52.909
- You think it was me.
- I didn't say that.

11:52.943 --> 11:54.007
But it's why you're here.

11:54.042 --> 11:55.745
No, I'm here because I'm committed

11:55.779 --> 11:57.480
to finding her killer.

11:57.514 --> 11:59.715
I can wait for the DNA analysis.

11:59.750 --> 12:01.382
But that'll take time.

12:02.166 --> 12:03.730
So, if there's anything
you want to tell me...

12:03.754 --> 12:05.588
I can tell you that I'm with you,

12:05.622 --> 12:07.135
or at least I was.

12:07.758 --> 12:09.425
I chose you,

12:09.459 --> 12:12.998
even when she called and called
and begged me to pick her.

12:14.262 --> 12:17.454
You said that she
was upset when she left.

12:18.135 --> 12:19.602
Was it about more than the teacups?

12:19.636 --> 12:21.262
Yeah, I turned her down.

12:22.139 --> 12:23.072
I pushed her out the door,

12:23.106 --> 12:25.141
where some monster
put a gun to her head...

12:25.175 --> 12:27.127
Look, I didn't come here...

12:27.945 --> 12:30.190
to accuse you of anything.

12:32.095 --> 12:34.717
Yes, you did.

12:36.720 --> 12:39.051
Do you know who this guy might be?

12:40.691 --> 12:41.996
I don't know.

12:42.726 --> 12:44.594
Could be Ethan...

12:44.628 --> 12:47.129
I guess, this... this guy she
started seeing from her firm.

12:47.164 --> 12:48.664
I thought it was for show.

12:52.169 --> 12:53.469
What?

12:54.869 --> 12:56.839
I went to a Super Bowl party
at Ethan's once.

12:56.874 --> 12:59.008
He lives three blocks from her.

12:59.042 --> 13:01.477
That's why she cut through the park.

13:07.184 --> 13:08.951
She almost made it home.

13:12.560 --> 13:13.845
Caroline left, like, 4:00-ish.

13:13.879 --> 13:14.985
She headed that way.

13:15.019 --> 13:16.462
I got an Uber and went to the gym.

13:16.497 --> 13:19.298
You let her walk home alone... at night?

13:19.333 --> 13:21.801
Well, technically, it was morning.

13:22.325 --> 13:23.870
Did you see anything different

13:23.904 --> 13:26.579
when you walked her out,
anyone hanging around?

13:26.760 --> 13:28.305
There were a couple of cars parked here.

13:28.329 --> 13:29.840
I mean, one of them was my Uber driver.

13:29.864 --> 13:31.731
I didn't see anyone
get into the other one.

13:31.765 --> 13:33.933
Did this car follow Caroline?

13:33.968 --> 13:35.902
Have you looked into her ex?

13:35.936 --> 13:37.770
That guy's a real douchebag.

13:37.805 --> 13:40.106
She had just come
from his place all upset

13:40.141 --> 13:41.458
because they had a fight.

13:42.209 --> 13:43.743
How about that vehicle description?

13:43.777 --> 13:46.613
Black, I think.

13:46.647 --> 13:48.781
James Nava, her ex...

13:48.816 --> 13:50.783
one of those square-jaw suits,

13:50.818 --> 13:52.685
probably has whips under his bed.

13:52.720 --> 13:54.921
Why don't we leave
the profiling to the pros?

13:54.955 --> 13:56.756
Caroline never got over that guy.

13:56.790 --> 14:00.894
Said he was banging
some hot skank from work.

14:13.674 --> 14:15.208
Congrats, Ethan.

14:15.242 --> 14:17.246
You're not as useless as you look.

14:21.621 --> 14:23.255
And that douchebag ex...

14:23.484 --> 14:25.835
he's the kind of guy
that walks a woman home.

14:26.353 --> 14:28.267
And there's nothing under his bed...

14:29.223 --> 14:30.556
except handcuffs...

14:31.258 --> 14:32.926
occasionally.

14:39.166 --> 14:41.790
You'll tell someone if
it starts talking to you, right?

14:42.870 --> 14:44.037
What?

14:44.071 --> 14:45.366
Man, you staring at the picture

14:45.401 --> 14:47.001
like it's about to say something to you.

14:47.908 --> 14:49.436
It already did.

14:55.416 --> 14:56.916
That's weird.

14:56.951 --> 14:59.185
I didn't think Woz knew
what a selfie was.

14:59.220 --> 15:00.354
Verco gave this to me.

15:00.389 --> 15:02.355
Well, consider the source, Loman.

15:02.389 --> 15:03.923
It's probably photoshopped.

15:03.958 --> 15:05.725
That's why I went to the marina...

15:07.228 --> 15:08.194
Spoke to several witnesses

15:08.229 --> 15:10.730
that put Donnie Pomp
and Wozniak there together

15:10.764 --> 15:11.864
multiple times.

15:11.899 --> 15:16.002
Woz wrote the book on
"keep your enemies close," so...

15:16.036 --> 15:17.503
Looks awfully friendly.

15:17.538 --> 15:20.039
And where I come from,
friends don't force people

15:20.074 --> 15:21.461
to steal for them.

15:22.743 --> 15:25.845
Woz may not always,
you know, fill in the blanks,

15:25.879 --> 15:28.781
but he's always looking out for us.

15:28.816 --> 15:30.216
Yeah? Maybe he was looking

15:30.251 --> 15:32.118
for a payday he didn't
have to split six ways.

15:32.152 --> 15:34.254
All right...

15:34.288 --> 15:36.923
our lieutenant may be a lot of things,

15:36.957 --> 15:38.695
but he wouldn't cheat us.

15:40.094 --> 15:42.729
I trust him, and you should, too.

15:49.169 --> 15:50.903
Hey, Detective Tufo,

15:50.938 --> 15:52.472
congratulations.

15:52.506 --> 15:53.883
Why don't you take off that IA badge,

15:53.907 --> 15:55.241
and let's head to the parking lot

15:55.276 --> 15:56.434
for a little conversation?

15:56.468 --> 15:58.244
What? I'm not always
the bearer of bad news.

15:58.279 --> 16:00.650
Your brother got paroled...
expedited release.

16:01.915 --> 16:03.549
You can pick him up tomorrow.

16:03.584 --> 16:05.442
I-I don't get it. What's the angle?

16:06.120 --> 16:07.931
There's no angle.
I mean, I said a few kind words,

16:07.955 --> 16:09.833
but you're the one who's
responsible for his release.

16:09.857 --> 16:10.900
I didn't ask you for any favors.

16:10.924 --> 16:12.502
So, if you're looking
for one in return, then...

16:12.526 --> 16:14.060
Parole board was very impressed

16:14.094 --> 16:15.833
with your level of commitment.

16:16.597 --> 16:18.650
You did yourself and your brother proud.

16:19.500 --> 16:23.080
I hope you're ready
to make good on that promise.

16:23.450 --> 16:25.705
Second chances are hard to come by.

16:26.840 --> 16:29.119
I don't need you to tell me
how to take care of my brother.

16:29.143 --> 16:31.778
I know. You're well aware of
all the bad elements out there.

16:35.983 --> 16:38.117
Of course, the really bad elements

16:38.152 --> 16:40.233
you need to be worried about
are closer to home.

16:50.197 --> 16:52.932
I got water and ketchup.

16:52.966 --> 16:54.892
Sorry, I'm a bad host.

16:55.502 --> 16:57.437
Trust me, I'm worse company.

16:58.205 --> 17:00.139
Water's fine.

17:00.174 --> 17:02.508
I, really appreciate you letting me

17:02.543 --> 17:04.146
come over, man.

17:10.842 --> 17:12.470
You need to hit a meeting?

17:13.811 --> 17:15.613
No.

17:15.646 --> 17:17.825
Well, I know I can't walk in with this.

17:21.653 --> 17:23.354
We need to flush that right now.

17:23.387 --> 17:25.417
No, no. No.

17:26.324 --> 17:28.309
What's going on with you, Sam?

17:29.060 --> 17:30.928
There's this woman.

17:30.962 --> 17:32.663
That's a familiar story.

17:35.000 --> 17:38.369
She drives me to do things
I know I shouldn't do.

17:38.403 --> 17:41.639
People like us... we're drawn to fire...

17:41.673 --> 17:43.641
in whatever form.

17:50.081 --> 17:52.316
I can't, all right? That's just...

17:54.186 --> 17:56.053
I just... I'm still too close, man.

17:56.087 --> 17:58.455
The flame's too hot. I'm sorry, man.

17:58.490 --> 18:00.055
Flush it.

18:07.365 --> 18:09.867
If Caroline had practiced safe sex,

18:09.901 --> 18:11.245
her murder may not have been solved.

18:11.269 --> 18:12.346
File that under "crime stories"

18:12.370 --> 18:14.371
that I will never tell my daughter."

18:14.406 --> 18:16.740
The security camera
caught footage of a vehicle

18:16.775 --> 18:18.842
matching lover boy's description...

18:18.877 --> 18:20.344
registered to Tanya Nelson.

18:20.378 --> 18:23.180
According to Organized Crime,
she's dating this mope...

18:23.215 --> 18:25.303
Vincent Rossi, lives here.

18:25.884 --> 18:27.327
I've seen him...

18:28.286 --> 18:31.055
lurking around my car
the night Caroline was popped.

18:31.089 --> 18:33.190
Took your gun without even asking?

18:33.225 --> 18:35.726
Such bad manners.

18:42.067 --> 18:44.239
Chinese food delivery.

18:49.074 --> 18:50.451
What's the point of busting a hit man

18:50.475 --> 18:51.508
if we know he's not home?

18:51.543 --> 18:53.344
We're not here to bust him.

18:53.378 --> 18:56.213
We're just taking back what's mine.

18:56.248 --> 18:59.216
Retrieve the gun
and leave this mess behind us.

18:59.251 --> 19:00.517
Justice for you.

19:00.552 --> 19:03.220
Sometimes you fight to win.

19:03.255 --> 19:05.879
Sometimes you fight not to lose anymore.

19:08.093 --> 19:10.204
Feels like we've been having
a lot of those days lately.

19:10.228 --> 19:11.623
Tess, hold up!

19:13.465 --> 19:17.101
Guess our guy doesn't like visitors.

19:17.135 --> 19:19.536
I've had warmer welcomes.

19:28.179 --> 19:31.048
You know, I actually left
some police work on my desk.

19:31.082 --> 19:34.151
Well, if it's on your desk,
you're not doing it right.

19:34.185 --> 19:35.563
I'm just saying,
if you want to ride around

19:35.587 --> 19:36.920
for miles in silence,

19:36.955 --> 19:39.056
there's other things I could be doing.

19:47.966 --> 19:50.100
Somebody on the inside
ready to talk for a deal?

19:50.135 --> 19:53.304
That's funny that's
where your mind goes.

19:53.338 --> 19:55.939
No, I wanted to show you
what gate to use

19:55.974 --> 19:58.442
when you come pick up your brother.

20:00.979 --> 20:02.246
You heard about Wallace.

20:02.280 --> 20:03.881
Not from you.

20:04.883 --> 20:06.450
Well, I just found out.

20:06.484 --> 20:07.962
I-I haven't had a chance to tell you.

20:07.986 --> 20:09.330
You could have filled that silence

20:09.354 --> 20:10.988
you were just bitching about.

20:11.022 --> 20:13.424
Your mood didn't exactly
pave the way for good news, Woz.

20:13.458 --> 20:14.458
Mood.

20:14.484 --> 20:16.960
Look, I'm gonna be the first
to a raise a glass for Wallace

20:16.995 --> 20:18.329
if he got out the right way.

20:18.363 --> 20:19.797
Meaning what?

20:19.831 --> 20:21.498
Meaning after five tries,

20:21.533 --> 20:23.801
that must be one hell of a story.

20:23.835 --> 20:26.103
Parole approved, the end.

20:26.137 --> 20:26.970
Now tell me the one

20:27.005 --> 20:29.006
about Donnie sailing off
with our payday.

20:29.040 --> 20:30.974
That one remains a mystery.

20:31.009 --> 20:32.976
You guys didn't talk about it?

20:33.011 --> 20:34.511
That's funny. I heard you were close.

20:34.546 --> 20:37.381
Don't trust everything you hear.

20:37.415 --> 20:40.384
And some things you need
to see with your own two eyes,

20:40.418 --> 20:43.153
like you and Verco sneaking around

20:43.188 --> 20:44.621
like some middle-school couple.

20:44.656 --> 20:46.223
No, I think you got the monopoly

20:46.257 --> 20:48.892
on secret relationships
with Internal Affairs.

20:50.362 --> 20:52.563
I'll find my own ride back, all right?

20:56.568 --> 20:59.069
What, Internal Affairs
didn't send you a car?

20:59.104 --> 21:01.338
You didn't negotiate
some perks in your deal?

21:01.373 --> 21:02.483
I never known you to be a pussy, Woz.

21:02.507 --> 21:04.875
You want to accuse me of
something, come out and say it.

21:04.909 --> 21:06.176
You sold us out.

21:06.211 --> 21:07.344
You way off your game.

21:07.379 --> 21:08.912
You want to find the son of a bitch

21:08.947 --> 21:10.247
who's been lying to our crew?

21:10.281 --> 21:12.182
Go find yourself a mirror.

21:12.217 --> 21:14.318
You sold out the freezer!

21:14.352 --> 21:15.986
After everything we've done for you!

21:16.020 --> 21:20.023
The only thing I gave up
was being lied to!

21:27.399 --> 21:29.333
I don't rat...

21:29.367 --> 21:31.668
not for anything or anyone.

21:34.706 --> 21:37.434
I followed you through fire, Woz.

21:38.376 --> 21:40.065
And I never blinked.

22:00.443 --> 22:02.210
Well, his sock drawer is color coded.

22:02.244 --> 22:03.544
And kid you not.

22:03.579 --> 22:06.114
No gunmetal, though.

22:06.148 --> 22:09.150
Well, OCD is probably
an asset in his line of work.

22:09.184 --> 22:10.764
Probably under his special skills

22:10.799 --> 22:12.845
in his Linkedln bio.

22:13.895 --> 22:16.090
He's methodical, organized.

22:19.049 --> 22:21.996
22 W 1. 350 J. 100 C.

22:22.031 --> 22:23.831
What's that... some sort of code?

22:23.866 --> 22:25.400
Like I said, methodical.

22:25.434 --> 22:26.929
More like a magician,

22:26.963 --> 22:30.004
considering how hard he's
making it to find your gun.

22:30.039 --> 22:33.074
Well, he must have it
on him wherever he is.

22:33.108 --> 22:36.311
C 725 Spring.

22:36.345 --> 22:39.313
22 Willoughby number one...
that's Nava's address.

22:39.348 --> 22:40.314
Well, that makes sense,

22:40.349 --> 22:42.959
considering that he followed
Caroline from there.

22:42.994 --> 22:44.519
350 Jay.

22:44.553 --> 22:47.021
100 Centre.

22:47.733 --> 22:48.990
My God.

22:49.464 --> 22:50.858
What?

22:51.254 --> 22:54.162
Downtown courthouse...
C train at 7:25 to Spring.

22:54.196 --> 22:56.330
It's the route Nava takes every morning

22:56.365 --> 22:57.365
to go from home to court.

22:57.399 --> 22:58.599
Nava's his next target.

23:11.586 --> 23:12.653
What court's he in?

23:12.687 --> 23:14.021
Judge Bailey, third floor.

23:14.055 --> 23:15.790
That's a pretty major escalation,

23:15.824 --> 23:16.857
taking out an ADA.

23:16.892 --> 23:19.393
My guy, my gun...
name a better way to get to me.

23:22.431 --> 23:24.799
Find security.

23:48.723 --> 23:50.391
Harlee.

23:50.425 --> 23:51.592
Have you seen this guy?

23:51.626 --> 23:53.661
I don't think so. Who is he?

23:53.695 --> 23:55.563
Part of a bigger problem.

23:55.597 --> 23:57.798
Am I supposed to know what that means?

24:05.640 --> 24:07.775
Stay here.

24:40.442 --> 24:42.676
Hey!

24:57.859 --> 24:58.759
I've been looking for this.

24:58.793 --> 25:00.327
You ought to thank me.

25:00.362 --> 25:01.795
He wasn't done with that blonde.

25:01.830 --> 25:03.430
Shut up! Don't make me improvise.

25:03.465 --> 25:04.742
All right, you got what
you wanted... now let me walk.

25:04.766 --> 25:07.668
Get back to the boyfriend while
he still has his carotid artery.

25:09.704 --> 25:11.805
Let me go, bitch!

25:15.544 --> 25:16.744
Help!

25:16.778 --> 25:17.811
No!

25:28.657 --> 25:31.592
Hey, Espada, I need you to take a break,

25:31.626 --> 25:33.794
go over to the butcher's over on Canda.

25:33.828 --> 25:35.529
You sending me on a rib run?

25:35.564 --> 25:36.530
No, there's a bunch of lowlifes there.

25:36.565 --> 25:38.866
I need you just to
get them away from there.

25:38.900 --> 25:41.372
- On the books or off?
- Off.

25:43.338 --> 25:45.372
That's what you get for lurking!

25:45.407 --> 25:47.041
Most accidents happen...

25:47.075 --> 25:49.109
because people exercise poor judgment.

25:49.144 --> 25:50.678
Go get some cold water on it,

25:50.712 --> 25:52.613
'cause someone's where
they shouldn't be!

25:53.448 --> 25:55.716
- Go wash it off!
- Yeah, thanks!

26:22.877 --> 26:24.178
Better watch where you're going.

26:24.212 --> 26:25.746
Those posts don't yield.

26:25.780 --> 26:26.824
You know that bullet in the blonde's

26:26.848 --> 26:29.583
gonna tell a story
you don't want anyone to hear.

26:29.618 --> 26:31.685
Depending upon the author,

26:31.720 --> 26:33.420
a story can change.

26:33.455 --> 26:36.557
Last I checked,
an arrest wasn't on the agenda.

26:36.591 --> 26:37.691
Vincent Rossi...

26:37.726 --> 26:39.426
Bianchi's hit man.

26:39.461 --> 26:40.928
He went after Nava in public.

26:40.962 --> 26:42.663
I couldn't let him walk.

26:42.697 --> 26:44.732
Or a dark corner
and a bullet in the head

26:44.766 --> 26:46.500
would have solved the problem.

26:46.534 --> 26:48.836
Caroline's family
deserves actual justice.

26:48.870 --> 26:51.105
Justice wasn't a priority yesterday.

26:51.139 --> 26:52.740
Priorities change.

26:52.774 --> 26:54.775
And I guess where you spend your nights

26:54.809 --> 26:56.883
has nothing to do with it?

26:57.746 --> 26:59.913
I'm gonna need that drop gun of yours,

26:59.948 --> 27:01.615
the one that actually makes a set

27:01.650 --> 27:02.549
with the official ballistics.

27:02.584 --> 27:05.786
So you're gonna frame
the actual murderer.

27:05.820 --> 27:07.826
That's rich.

27:08.556 --> 27:09.590
Do you have it?

27:09.624 --> 27:11.125
You think Bianchi's gonna come up

27:11.159 --> 27:14.628
and shake your hand and
congratulate you for the win?

27:14.663 --> 27:17.798
Do you know how much fuel
you're throwing on the fire now?

27:17.832 --> 27:20.067
I swore to protect and serve.

27:24.381 --> 27:25.572
Is that him?

27:25.607 --> 27:27.608
James, if you go anywhere near him,

27:27.642 --> 27:28.475
you'll give his lawyer leverage.

27:28.510 --> 27:30.367
I just want to ask him a few questions.

27:30.402 --> 27:32.112
And you know better.

27:40.855 --> 27:42.556
We're building our case.

27:42.590 --> 27:43.957
You got to have a theory.

27:43.992 --> 27:45.726
Come on, Harlee, he was coming after me.

27:45.760 --> 27:47.061
I got a right to know.

27:47.095 --> 27:49.323
He works for Michael Bianchi.

27:51.099 --> 27:52.800
It's not your fault.

27:52.834 --> 27:54.501
Caroline was gunned down by an associate

27:54.536 --> 27:55.803
of someone I prosecuted.

27:55.837 --> 27:56.737
It's sure as hell not a coincidence.

27:56.771 --> 27:59.606
I know you prosecutors
have a God complex,

27:59.641 --> 28:01.742
but you can't control fate, all right?

28:01.776 --> 28:03.154
And if you try to
make sense of everything,

28:03.178 --> 28:04.678
you're gonna make yourself crazy.

28:04.713 --> 28:06.184
What about you?

28:06.681 --> 28:07.548
Too late. I'm already crazy.

28:07.582 --> 28:09.583
No, no, you testified against Bianchi.

28:09.617 --> 28:10.828
You just arrested one of his guys.

28:10.852 --> 28:12.820
- I was doing my job.
- So was I.

28:12.854 --> 28:15.683
Now Caroline's dead.
A gunman came after me.

28:16.891 --> 28:18.869
I'm not supposed to worry
about what happens next time

28:18.893 --> 28:20.243
you're alone somewhere?

28:20.829 --> 28:23.764
Look, you got enough to carry
without worrying about me.

28:26.568 --> 28:28.899
I got a feeling
I signed up for that job...

28:29.637 --> 28:30.804
permanently.

28:59.834 --> 29:01.668
Federal Bureau of Investigations.

29:01.703 --> 29:02.970
How may I direct your call?

29:12.135 --> 29:13.601
I'd jump.

29:14.202 --> 29:17.528
Drowning's much more pleasant
than what I have planned.

29:18.173 --> 29:19.941
And here I thought your reaching out

29:19.975 --> 29:21.809
was a sign of progress.

29:21.844 --> 29:25.379
You target Julia. You attack my family.

29:25.414 --> 29:26.981
You ruin me and Harlee.

29:27.015 --> 29:29.350
And now you're messing
with me and my people.

29:29.384 --> 29:32.320
As usual, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

29:32.354 --> 29:34.989
You're feeding information
to Internal Affairs

29:35.023 --> 29:36.057
about my crew.

29:36.091 --> 29:36.891
Internal Aff...

29:36.925 --> 29:39.160
Why would I talk to Internal Affairs?

29:39.194 --> 29:40.795
I quit trying to figure out

29:40.829 --> 29:43.130
your methods with dressed-up hookers.

29:43.566 --> 29:44.732
Try thinking further

29:44.766 --> 29:46.511
than six inches in front
of your face, Lieutenant.

29:46.535 --> 29:48.870
I don't need Internal Affairs
to take you down.

29:48.904 --> 29:50.471
And there's only one thing

29:50.506 --> 29:52.740
that's keeping me from doing it myself.

29:52.774 --> 29:55.309
I know for a fact it's an FBI source.

29:55.344 --> 29:57.078
Let me be very clear about something.

29:57.112 --> 30:00.388
I will dismantle any part
of your life I need to

30:00.422 --> 30:02.495
to get what I want, but on this,

30:02.529 --> 30:04.224
I'm not your guy.

30:05.113 --> 30:07.168
You've lost control...

30:08.264 --> 30:10.224
'cause somebody in your sandbox

30:10.259 --> 30:13.335
is trying to bury your investigation.

30:22.980 --> 30:24.314
You send me on a cleanup

30:24.348 --> 30:26.216
while you're out busting mobsters.

30:26.250 --> 30:27.561
Sounds like you've been plenty busy.

30:27.585 --> 30:29.319
I got a tip. I called Harlee.

30:29.353 --> 30:31.588
- What's the tip?
- Is this an interrogation?

30:31.622 --> 30:33.623
Seems like you two
were working on a case all day,

30:33.658 --> 30:34.964
keeping it from the rest of us.

30:35.626 --> 30:38.561
Two girls busting assassins
is a threat now?

30:38.596 --> 30:39.930
You pick up a mob enforcer,

30:39.964 --> 30:41.564
you put a target on all our backs.

30:41.599 --> 30:43.176
It'd be nice to at least get a heads-up.

30:43.200 --> 30:45.012
What happened to your lip?

30:45.047 --> 30:46.670
Nothing these walls want to hear.

30:46.704 --> 30:48.471
You solved the murder?

30:48.506 --> 30:50.340
I got to take this down to evidence.

30:50.374 --> 30:51.860
Tell me a story?

30:54.211 --> 30:56.279
How do you feel
about unsolicited advice?

30:56.314 --> 30:59.582
Keep in mind, I am wiser
and have more experience.

30:59.617 --> 31:01.518
Depends on the arena.

31:01.552 --> 31:02.953
Is it about being a cop?

31:02.987 --> 31:04.822
If you have to think about something

31:04.856 --> 31:07.924
for more than five minutes,
you already know the answer.

31:07.959 --> 31:11.561
Did you know Woz
and Donnie Pomp were friends?

31:13.397 --> 31:14.197
Where's this coming from?

31:14.231 --> 31:16.360
It's coming from me, asking you.

31:17.034 --> 31:19.769
All I know is that Donnie was dirty.

31:19.804 --> 31:20.937
Pulled us into a job.

31:20.972 --> 31:22.439
That doesn't sound like friendship.

31:22.473 --> 31:24.941
Well, I've seen evidence
that suggests otherwise.

31:24.976 --> 31:26.977
Check your source.

31:27.011 --> 31:28.144
It's a force of habit.

31:28.179 --> 31:30.380
You know, I believed everything
that man ever told me,

31:30.414 --> 31:33.283
just accepted it as fact.

31:33.317 --> 31:34.494
But outside of what he told us,

31:34.518 --> 31:37.554
what do we really know about
what went down with Donnie Pomp?

31:37.588 --> 31:40.457
Well, Donnie's in the wind,
and the money's gone.

31:40.491 --> 31:42.559
And Woz loves you. Those are the facts.

31:42.593 --> 31:44.728
So, whatever else
is messing with your head,

31:44.762 --> 31:46.237
let it go.

31:46.271 --> 31:49.045
Here you go. And sign here.

31:52.003 --> 31:54.871
Hi. You've reached Linda Wozniak.

31:54.905 --> 31:57.086
Please leave a...

31:58.576 --> 32:01.511
Hi. You've reached Linda Wozniak.

32:01.545 --> 32:02.979
Please leave a message.

32:08.719 --> 32:11.354
Matt, I-I can't talk right now.

32:11.389 --> 32:12.589
Just... just listen.

32:12.623 --> 32:14.257
I'm in a bookstore.

32:14.291 --> 32:16.359
People listen in bookstores.

32:16.394 --> 32:18.828
O-okay, please?

32:18.863 --> 32:20.330
I'm listening.

32:20.364 --> 32:22.699
Remember the apartment a-at Park Slope?

32:22.733 --> 32:25.935
I think Nate was, like, five or six?

32:25.970 --> 32:27.370
What about it?

32:27.405 --> 32:29.372
I was remembering the, um...

32:29.407 --> 32:31.541
the window above the bedroom.

32:31.575 --> 32:32.879
And...

32:33.477 --> 32:37.547
I used to look back at it
when I was on my way

32:37.581 --> 32:39.049
off to the night shift.

32:39.083 --> 32:40.717
Yeah, I remember.

32:40.751 --> 32:41.918
I didn't sleep for a year.

32:41.952 --> 32:45.288
You never really had
anything to worry about.

32:45.322 --> 32:47.447
I used to watch...

32:49.060 --> 32:52.151
you and Nate reading to each other.

32:53.130 --> 32:54.647
And...

32:55.966 --> 32:59.069
there... there was just no way

32:59.103 --> 33:02.072
that I was not coming home.

33:03.007 --> 33:05.086
Well, that was a long time ago.

33:06.010 --> 33:07.598
Look, Linda...

33:08.679 --> 33:12.082
We're... we're family.

33:12.116 --> 33:13.650
That's what I was remembering.

33:13.684 --> 33:16.986
It... it's not me against the world.

33:17.021 --> 33:19.422
It's us.

33:19.457 --> 33:21.424
And I should have told you this...

33:23.694 --> 33:25.628
I should have told you this before.

33:27.598 --> 33:30.567
I-I don't know why I didn't, but...

33:32.770 --> 33:35.138
I-I-I love you.

33:35.172 --> 33:36.375
I...

33:37.041 --> 33:38.599
That's it.

33:41.178 --> 33:43.913
Bye.

33:47.785 --> 33:49.018
Thinking of escaping?

33:50.821 --> 33:52.655
Excuse me?

33:54.558 --> 33:56.459
Travel section.

33:56.494 --> 33:58.461
Right. No, no.

33:58.496 --> 34:01.531
I was... dreaming.

34:06.737 --> 34:09.472
You should make your husband
take you someplace warm...

34:11.835 --> 34:14.737
Before the weather takes a brutal turn.

34:27.995 --> 34:29.360
I'm a half a block from my house.

34:29.396 --> 34:31.362
David Zachariah's a
Does it have to be tonight?

34:31.398 --> 34:34.867
You can tell Christina
I'll have you home early.

34:34.900 --> 34:36.802
Be there in an hour.

34:36.835 --> 34:38.804
We need to clear the air around us

34:38.838 --> 34:40.260
before we choke on it.

34:40.293 --> 34:42.641
I can think of more secure
locations than the freezer

34:42.676 --> 34:45.643
for this mysterious powwow...
like pretty much anywhere.

34:45.679 --> 34:47.545
It passed inspection.

34:47.581 --> 34:49.447
We're solid on that front.

34:49.482 --> 34:51.884
Always bombs going off somewhere.

34:51.918 --> 34:54.216
You launched a pretty big one
at Bianchi.

34:55.121 --> 34:57.121
Look, I know it's not
a play you would have called,

34:57.157 --> 34:59.291
but I appreciate you having my back.

34:59.326 --> 35:01.393
I just got tired
of dancing with the Devil.

35:01.428 --> 35:04.763
At least when we're dancing,
you know where his hands are.

35:04.798 --> 35:06.765
Yeah, I thought if I got
my hands on my gun,

35:06.800 --> 35:09.524
that would be enough,
but now I realize it's not.

35:11.171 --> 35:13.906
Bianchi will keep coming
until he gets what he wants.

35:13.940 --> 35:15.808
You can handle the heat.

35:15.842 --> 35:17.776
Just keep your head on a swivel.

35:17.811 --> 35:20.376
The music's still playing.

35:40.200 --> 35:41.834
Drop it, or I drop you!

35:41.868 --> 35:43.769
I'm sorry! Please, don't shoot.

35:43.803 --> 35:45.537
Mom! My God.

35:45.572 --> 35:47.806
- Get back inside!
- Put your gun down!

35:47.841 --> 35:48.674
God, are you okay, Monica?

35:48.708 --> 35:51.310
You weren't answering your phone.

35:51.344 --> 35:52.478
Wait. You know her?

35:52.512 --> 35:53.522
She was at the window. I thought...

35:53.546 --> 35:55.514
Are you serious?
You could have hurt someone!

36:09.029 --> 36:10.663
You want to tell me what that was?

36:10.697 --> 36:12.865
That was my friend from school!

36:12.899 --> 36:14.833
- That's your story?
- What?

36:14.868 --> 36:16.265
What, you think I don't know that Miguel

36:16.289 --> 36:18.237
has a niece named Monica?

36:18.271 --> 36:21.173
- Do not do that thing.
- What thing?

36:21.207 --> 36:23.842
The thing where you spiral
out of what we're talking about

36:23.877 --> 36:26.578
and you put me on the
defensive for something else.

36:26.613 --> 36:28.681
Okay, all right, all right.
It was a mistake!

36:28.715 --> 36:29.682
I...

36:29.716 --> 36:31.684
I overreacted, okay?

36:31.718 --> 36:32.718
I...

36:34.287 --> 36:36.255
You know what? No.

36:36.289 --> 36:37.864
No, I'm...

36:38.558 --> 36:40.526
I'm not gonna put you
in the middle of this.

36:40.560 --> 36:42.227
In the middle of what?

36:45.031 --> 36:47.496
I solved a murder case today.

36:48.902 --> 36:50.703
Okay.

36:50.737 --> 36:52.438
Isn't that your job?

36:52.472 --> 36:55.207
Yes, but sometimes me doing my job

36:55.241 --> 36:57.476
makes other people angry.

37:03.783 --> 37:04.883
Mom...

37:10.194 --> 37:12.149
Are you in danger?

37:13.660 --> 37:16.228
I'm... I'm taking care of it, okay?

37:18.811 --> 37:20.561
Which is why you freaked out?

37:21.568 --> 37:23.816
Which is why I freaked, yeah.

37:25.271 --> 37:28.474
Look, Christina, baby, I...

37:28.508 --> 37:31.043
I hate that I have
to ask you to do this,

37:31.077 --> 37:33.779
but I have no choice, all right?

37:33.813 --> 37:34.913
You're gonna have...

37:34.948 --> 37:37.383
You need me to go to Aunt Gemma's.

37:37.417 --> 37:38.751
Yes.

37:38.785 --> 37:40.753
I'll take care of this
as quickly as I can.

37:40.787 --> 37:43.789
I promise, but if there
is even the slightest chance

37:43.823 --> 37:46.492
- that something could...
- Mom, Mom, it's okay.

37:46.526 --> 37:47.926
It's okay.

37:47.961 --> 37:49.795
I get it.

37:49.829 --> 37:51.263
You need me to be safe,

37:51.297 --> 37:54.433
but I really need you to be safe, too.

37:56.469 --> 37:58.142
You got to come with me.

37:58.838 --> 38:01.238
This is my responsibility.

38:02.809 --> 38:04.581
And I can't hide.

38:05.011 --> 38:07.446
I have to stay here and take care of it.

38:07.480 --> 38:09.798
What about taking care of yourself?

38:12.018 --> 38:13.319
Please.

38:13.820 --> 38:15.598
Please, Mom.

38:17.191 --> 38:19.189
You got to come with me.

38:30.904 --> 38:32.638
Hey.

38:32.672 --> 38:34.873
Hey, you're two drinks late.

38:34.908 --> 38:36.842
I was on time when I parked.

38:36.876 --> 38:38.844
Just couldn't seem to get out the car.

38:38.878 --> 38:41.313
I'm not complaining.

38:41.347 --> 38:44.883
The Greeks had this tradition.

38:44.918 --> 38:48.053
When they landed on an enemy's shore,

38:48.087 --> 38:50.260
they burned their own boats.

38:50.890 --> 38:52.658
Why's that?

38:52.692 --> 38:54.934
No turning back.

38:56.062 --> 38:58.363
The only thing you could trust

38:58.398 --> 39:00.673
is the man that was next to you.

39:01.835 --> 39:03.836
No turning back.

39:08.875 --> 39:11.343
Come with me. Kevin, keep it.

39:19.886 --> 39:21.782
You want to tell me what this is about?

39:22.956 --> 39:24.998
Here, until you get one of your own.

39:25.725 --> 39:29.027
It was Saperstein's.
He won't mind, I promise.

39:29.062 --> 39:30.425
I'm good.

39:31.358 --> 39:32.791
Suit yourself.

39:37.550 --> 39:39.751
Who's the tough guy with no coat?

39:39.939 --> 39:41.573
What is this, the Popsicle heist?

39:41.608 --> 39:43.709
Inner sanctum.

39:43.743 --> 39:45.010
Crew business only.

39:45.044 --> 39:46.712
Away from prying eyes and ears.

39:46.746 --> 39:48.759
And hostile parties.

39:50.083 --> 39:51.550
Sorry. It was almost like trying

39:51.584 --> 39:53.051
to park in New York out there.

39:53.086 --> 39:54.052
Put this on.

39:54.087 --> 39:55.854
I'm not cold.

39:55.889 --> 39:57.623
Hey, don't be a hero.

39:57.657 --> 39:58.957
It's called being numb.

39:58.992 --> 40:01.426
Don't worry. We won't be here that long.

40:01.461 --> 40:02.761
Man, you just got here,

40:02.795 --> 40:05.071
and you're already laying out
the agenda?

40:06.933 --> 40:08.470
What are we doing here?

40:09.903 --> 40:11.383
Um...

40:12.452 --> 40:15.627
I-I-I was never big on confessionals.

40:16.242 --> 40:17.910
You need to get right with somebody,

40:17.944 --> 40:20.025
you have a face-to-face.

40:20.947 --> 40:23.815
Now, Internal Affairs
has been everywhere,

40:23.850 --> 40:26.752
making us think that they're
looking around the corner.

40:26.786 --> 40:28.921
It got to my head.

40:29.522 --> 40:32.758
And I thought somebody was talking.

40:33.760 --> 40:38.130
It turns out
that it was smoke and mirrors,

40:38.164 --> 40:41.099
but the damage was done...

40:41.134 --> 40:45.137
as soon as I started doubting
the people in this room.

40:46.973 --> 40:48.974
It won't happen again.

40:49.008 --> 40:50.609
So we're supposed to what?

40:50.643 --> 40:53.610
We're all supposed to
hold hands and sing Kumbaya,

40:53.673 --> 40:54.863
pretend like everything's okay?

40:54.887 --> 40:56.564
Families fight.

40:56.589 --> 40:58.116
They fight, and then they move on.

40:58.151 --> 41:00.018
Or they don't make it.

41:00.053 --> 41:01.954
You're right, Lieutenant.

41:02.541 --> 41:04.623
I mean, you're not big on confessionals,

41:04.657 --> 41:06.769
but then again, I don't think
you understand how they work.

41:06.793 --> 41:09.205
- Loman...
- One of us is talking.

41:09.963 --> 41:12.590
And it's not Internal Affairs
who's listening.

41:15.835 --> 41:18.003
Our fearless leader...

41:18.037 --> 41:20.085
a man so obsessed

41:20.740 --> 41:23.942
with loyalty and obedience...

41:25.979 --> 41:27.879
Is working with the FBI.

41:31.918 --> 41:34.853
I saw you meeting with the Feds...

41:34.887 --> 41:36.888
same agent who picked me up
after the heist.

41:36.923 --> 41:38.957
I followed you.

41:41.194 --> 41:43.895
Lieutenant Wozniak is the rat.

41:48.912 --> 41:50.863
What's he talking about, Woz?

41:51.938 --> 41:53.839
Loman, don't burn the boat.

41:53.873 --> 41:55.807
Answer the question, Woz.

41:55.842 --> 41:56.842
It's not true.

41:56.876 --> 41:58.644
- Yes, it is, Harlee.
- No.

41:58.678 --> 42:00.812
Harlee, don't.

42:02.248 --> 42:04.549
Wozniak isn't the informant.

42:08.955 --> 42:10.789
I am.
