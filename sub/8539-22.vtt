00:01.914 --> 00:04.700
[instrumental music]

00:29.159 --> 00:30.508
[sniffs]

00:30.595 --> 00:32.858
Excuse me.

00:32.945 --> 00:36.210
What kind of tree is this?

00:36.297 --> 00:37.733
Couldn't say.

00:37.820 --> 00:39.952
[sniffs]
Smells good.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.867
So you're not a local?

00:41.954 --> 00:43.260
Born five miles
down the road.

00:43.347 --> 00:45.654
Just don't give a crap
about trees.

01:00.799 --> 01:03.106
Name's Justin Prentiss.

01:03.193 --> 01:04.716
Student at
a private school operation

01:04.803 --> 01:06.457
a couple miles from here.

01:06.544 --> 01:08.764
They realized he was missing
around 6:00 this morning,

01:08.851 --> 01:10.983
activated the electronic
monitoring device

01:11.071 --> 01:13.508
'on his ankle, found him
and called us at 8:00.'

01:13.595 --> 01:15.379
Do they have an estimated
time of death yet?

01:15.466 --> 01:16.946
Coroner puts time of death

01:17.033 --> 01:18.513
somewhere between 10:00
and 1:00 last night.

01:18.600 --> 01:20.297
'I wanted to take him
down the mountain'

01:20.384 --> 01:22.865
soon as forensics were done,
but as per your request

01:22.952 --> 01:23.909
we didn't touch him.

01:23.996 --> 01:25.389
Oh, we won't be here long.

01:25.476 --> 01:27.217
You can have him
as soon as we're done.

01:27.304 --> 01:28.610
What's with
the ankle bracelet?

01:28.697 --> 01:31.395
Good question.
Mr. Maclean?

01:36.313 --> 01:38.924
'This is the principal
of the school. Asher Maclean.'

01:39.011 --> 01:40.622
'These people are from the CBI.'

01:40.709 --> 01:43.364
They want to know why your
student has an electronic

01:43.451 --> 01:45.670
monitoring device on him.

01:45.757 --> 01:49.152
Justin had some truancy issues
recently, hence the device.

01:49.239 --> 01:50.893
What kind of school
is this, exactly?

01:50.980 --> 01:53.287
Bright Arch is a wilderness
program for troubled youth.

01:53.374 --> 01:54.679
Like a summer camp?

01:54.766 --> 01:56.768
No, we're an accredited
high school.

01:56.855 --> 01:59.423
Students stay at Bright Arch
for a year, on average.

01:59.510 --> 02:01.208
'We provide structure
and discipline'

02:01.295 --> 02:02.774
'through close interaction
with nature'

02:02.861 --> 02:07.562
plus a regular high school
curriculum, of course.

02:07.649 --> 02:10.173
Hmm.

02:10.260 --> 02:13.263
Uh, she doesn't like you,
and you don't like her.

02:13.350 --> 02:15.178
Why is that?

02:15.265 --> 02:16.832
No comment.

02:18.529 --> 02:20.444
Chief Brody?

02:20.531 --> 02:22.229
Why don't you like him?

02:22.316 --> 02:23.795
What has that got to do
with anything?

02:23.882 --> 02:25.362
I'm just curious.

02:25.449 --> 02:27.495
Think you might show
a little more respect.

02:27.582 --> 02:30.411
- Respect for, uh--
- There is a dead child here.

02:30.498 --> 02:32.891
Yes. Yes, he's dead.

02:32.978 --> 02:34.850
He doesn't care
how I talk to you.

02:38.375 --> 02:40.160
I've never worked
with the CBI before.

02:40.247 --> 02:41.422
Do all your units
come with a clown?

02:41.509 --> 02:42.901
We get the job done.

02:42.988 --> 02:45.600
Well, how about
getting it done now?

02:45.687 --> 02:49.604
So we can take this kid out
of here. How would that be?

02:49.691 --> 02:51.867
Yeah. We'll do that.

02:51.954 --> 02:54.652
Yep, you can take him.
We've got the basic facts.

02:54.739 --> 02:56.132
Oh, is that right?
That quick, huh?

02:56.219 --> 02:58.917
- Uh, yeah.
- You want to enlighten us?

02:59.004 --> 03:00.789
Oh, forensics probably
told you

03:00.876 --> 03:02.834
a lot of it already
I would guess.

03:02.921 --> 03:05.010
'Uh, his knuckles
and his knees suggest'

03:05.097 --> 03:08.057
that he was overpowered
in a hand-to-hand struggle.

03:08.144 --> 03:11.408
The blow to the head
was the coup de grace.

03:11.495 --> 03:15.369
But the ground around him
is relatively undisturbed

03:15.456 --> 03:17.806
which means that the struggle

03:17.893 --> 03:19.634
would have
taken place elsewhere.

03:19.721 --> 03:22.332
Uphill, presumably.

03:22.419 --> 03:25.553
Injured animals tend to move
downhill, of course.

03:25.640 --> 03:27.685
Do you have
any actual facts?

03:27.772 --> 03:30.906
Well, it's an actual fact that
you dislike Mr. Maclean here

03:30.993 --> 03:33.561
because he's a tree-hugging,
liberal wacko.

03:33.648 --> 03:35.650
'He's probably running
some kind of a cult'

03:35.737 --> 03:37.608
and he dislikes you because
you're a small-minded

03:37.695 --> 03:39.436
'provincial hayseed.'

03:39.523 --> 03:42.439
Not that you are, necessarily.
That's just what he thinks.

03:42.526 --> 03:45.007
Facts pertaining
to this poor boy.

03:47.705 --> 03:50.882
There was no moon last night,
so it was very dark.

03:50.969 --> 03:53.189
Justin wouldn't have been able
to move very far,

03:53.276 --> 03:55.147
injured as he was.

03:55.235 --> 03:57.541
He had a lot of dirt
in his hair

03:57.628 --> 03:59.630
a lot of dirt in his ears

03:59.717 --> 04:01.328
and deep up under his nails.

04:01.415 --> 04:06.942
So somewhere close by,
somewhere veryclose by

04:07.029 --> 04:10.337
there's a spot
where someone, uh..

04:10.424 --> 04:12.164
Ohh.

04:12.252 --> 04:14.732
Where someone
buried him alive.

04:14.819 --> 04:16.604
Oh, my God.

04:21.913 --> 04:24.786
[instrumental music]

04:32.184 --> 04:35.100
[Maclean]
'Alright, alright, alright!'

04:35.187 --> 04:37.015
'Settle down, folks.'

04:37.102 --> 04:39.279
'Take your seats.'

04:40.845 --> 04:42.891
'Let's go.'

04:47.374 --> 04:50.507
I know the last couple of days
have been rough.

04:50.594 --> 04:52.292
Losing Justin hurts.

04:52.379 --> 04:56.078
But his death cannot
become your crutch

04:56.165 --> 04:58.863
'for a negative attitude.'

04:58.950 --> 05:03.215
You can learn and grow
from this experience.

05:05.043 --> 05:06.654
Bryan.

05:06.741 --> 05:08.308
Sir, do we still get to do

05:08.395 --> 05:10.571
the sacred fire ceremony
on Friday?

05:10.658 --> 05:13.530
I think there's all the more
reason to do it now.

05:13.617 --> 05:16.620
We need healing.
Alright, listen, kids,

05:16.707 --> 05:19.754
the strangers you see here
are detectives

05:19.841 --> 05:23.845
that will be investigating
the situation with Justin.

05:23.932 --> 05:26.935
'They are here to find out
what happened to him'

05:27.022 --> 05:30.721
and I want all of you to answer
any questions they have

05:30.808 --> 05:33.071
'as best you can.'

05:33.158 --> 05:34.899
Yes, yes, yes, people?

05:34.986 --> 05:37.685
[all]
Yes, yes, yes!

05:37.772 --> 05:40.122
Is it true that
he was buried alive?

05:40.209 --> 05:43.517
- Orrin--
- Oh, yeah, that is true.

05:43.604 --> 05:46.607
- Who did it?
- That's enough, Elliot.

05:46.694 --> 05:49.174
Let's all get back
to our classes quickly.

05:49.261 --> 05:51.351
'We're wasting daylight!'

05:51.438 --> 05:53.353
You guys go and talk
to the counselors.

05:53.440 --> 05:54.919
We'll press the principal,
see what he knows.

05:55.006 --> 05:56.573
- We'll talk to the kids last.
- 'Okay.'

05:56.660 --> 05:58.096
Mr. Maclean, I wanted to--

05:58.183 --> 06:01.361
Agent Lisbon,
excuse me. Orrin.

06:01.448 --> 06:05.277
We speak only when recognized
as part of the discussion.

06:07.062 --> 06:09.412
Okay? Get out of here.

06:09.499 --> 06:12.284
I'm sorry about that.
Well, welcome to Bright Arch.

06:12.372 --> 06:14.852
Shall we, uh,
convene in my office?

06:14.939 --> 06:16.463
Yes, yes, yes.

06:16.550 --> 06:18.421
Honey, just try to calm down
a little bit, okay?

06:18.508 --> 06:19.683
We'll find everything out.
Calm down.

06:19.770 --> 06:21.946
You son of a bitch.
What happened?

06:22.033 --> 06:23.470
What happened?
What did you do?

06:23.557 --> 06:25.950
Mr. Prentiss..
David, let's be calm now.

06:26.037 --> 06:28.300
Step back, sir. Now.

06:28.388 --> 06:30.912
It's okay.
It's okay.

06:32.566 --> 06:35.438
This man was supposed to
look after my son.

06:35.525 --> 06:37.484
'It's his responsibility
to keep his students safe'

06:37.571 --> 06:40.400
and he didn't!

06:40.487 --> 06:42.053
- He didn't!
- David!

06:42.140 --> 06:45.056
Mr. Prentiss,
let's go and talk. This way.

06:45.143 --> 06:46.841
This way now.

06:51.759 --> 06:55.153
How did you learn
about Bright Arch?

06:55.240 --> 06:56.851
One of David's colleagues

06:56.938 --> 06:59.636
has a child who had gone
way off-track.

06:59.723 --> 07:02.987
And they saw very positive
results from the program.

07:03.074 --> 07:04.815
Justin was misbehaving?

07:04.902 --> 07:06.948
He changed a lot
over the last year.

07:07.035 --> 07:09.777
Suddenly he was always
locked in his room, dour

07:09.864 --> 07:13.607
uncommunicative,
violent on occasion.

07:13.694 --> 07:15.522
'Therapy didn't work.'

07:15.609 --> 07:17.175
What kind of violence
did he engage in?

07:17.262 --> 07:20.701
He often shouted at me
and would threaten his father.

07:20.788 --> 07:24.531
Just shouting? No physical
abuse, no criminal behavior?

07:24.618 --> 07:26.271
No.

07:26.358 --> 07:28.273
[crying]

07:31.712 --> 07:35.759
Please find out
who did this.

07:35.846 --> 07:36.978
Please.

07:38.980 --> 07:41.330
[MacLean]
'Kids love to feed off
the drama of things like this.'

07:41.417 --> 07:43.463
I hope it can be
resolved quickly.

07:45.769 --> 07:48.119
You know, you look like
Burt Reynolds in this shot.

07:52.863 --> 07:54.561
How long has Bright Arch
been running?

07:54.648 --> 07:55.997
Almost ten years now.

07:56.084 --> 07:57.694
And that was
all of the students?

07:57.781 --> 08:00.697
Yes, we like to keep
a low counselor/student ratio

08:00.784 --> 08:02.830
'so that everyone
gets the focused'

08:02.917 --> 08:04.484
individual attention
that they need.

08:04.571 --> 08:06.268
Right. What's the pitch?

08:07.878 --> 08:09.053
I don't follow.

08:09.140 --> 08:10.838
The pitch,
the gimmick, the hook.

08:10.925 --> 08:12.970
How do you sell this place
to prospective parents?

08:13.057 --> 08:14.450
Oh, we really
don't have to sell it.

08:14.537 --> 08:16.321
They come by word of mouth.

08:16.408 --> 08:19.499
'This is a simple,
natural healing community'

08:19.586 --> 08:22.327
where your, uh,
troubled and underachieving

08:22.414 --> 08:24.373
sons and daughters
are encouraged to get in touch

08:24.460 --> 08:26.027
with their inner resources.

08:26.114 --> 08:27.463
Encouraged how?

08:27.550 --> 08:29.944
By a code of honor
and discipline,

08:30.031 --> 08:32.729
by learning wilderness skills
and teamwork

08:32.816 --> 08:35.166
through an up-close experience
with mother nature.

08:35.253 --> 08:37.995
- That's a good pitch.
- It's a good program.

08:38.082 --> 08:39.519
[knocks on door]

08:41.303 --> 08:44.872
- Yes, Cassie?
- Um, I got your tea.

08:44.959 --> 08:46.830
Oh. Thank you.

08:57.449 --> 09:00.496
One of our, uh,
our great success stories.

09:00.583 --> 09:03.630
Arrived here about nine months
ago angry and withdrawn.

09:03.717 --> 09:06.589
- She's blossomed wonderfully.
- Tell me about Justin.

09:06.676 --> 09:09.505
Why was he wearing
an electronic monitoring device?

09:09.592 --> 09:11.420
I looked around. I didn't see
anyone else wearing one.

09:11.507 --> 09:13.509
Justin had only been
with us three months.

09:13.596 --> 09:15.380
He was still
in the rebellious phase.

09:15.467 --> 09:18.079
Day before yesterday, he left
campus without permission

09:18.166 --> 09:19.820
for several hours.

09:19.907 --> 09:22.431
He refused to tell us where
he had been and with whom.

09:22.518 --> 09:26.261
His punishment was eight hours
in the reflection room

09:26.348 --> 09:29.873
and the electronic monitoring
device for, uh, two weeks.

09:29.960 --> 09:31.571
Confinement and dog collars.

09:31.658 --> 09:34.356
Yeah, that'll certainly,
uh, encourage the discovery

09:34.443 --> 09:36.750
of inner resources, I guess.

09:36.837 --> 09:38.969
But do the kids' parents know
that's part of the deal?

09:39.056 --> 09:41.929
It's in the brochure.
Page three.

09:44.758 --> 09:46.847
So you must get
a lot of problem kids.

09:48.718 --> 09:50.328
How do you handle
the psychos?

09:50.415 --> 09:52.287
The ones that just won't
knuckle under no matter what?

09:52.374 --> 09:54.071
We don't take 'em
in the first place.

09:54.158 --> 09:56.247
I vet thoroughly
every acceptance.

09:56.334 --> 09:58.772
So no name jumped into your head
when you heard about the murder?

09:58.859 --> 10:02.253
- No.
- You ever heard of Z Krew?

10:02.340 --> 10:04.429
No. What's that?

10:07.694 --> 10:09.434
I'd like to talk
to Justin's friends.

10:09.521 --> 10:11.611
Of course. He was in
Missy Jenkins' teaching pod.

10:11.698 --> 10:13.177
Great.

10:13.264 --> 10:15.353
Bear in mind that I
or one of my staff members

10:15.440 --> 10:19.444
need to be present before you
talk with any of our students.

10:19.531 --> 10:21.969
- Is that right?
- It's the law.

10:22.056 --> 10:23.361
Really?

10:29.803 --> 10:31.587
Ohh. I hate the woods.

10:31.674 --> 10:36.853
Would you rather be playing desk
jockey with Van Pelt right now?

10:36.940 --> 10:39.029
Who sends their kids
to a place like this?

10:39.116 --> 10:40.248
'It's not cheap, either.'

10:40.335 --> 10:41.728
Eh, a little deprivation
and discipline

10:41.815 --> 10:43.207
is good for the soul.

10:43.294 --> 10:45.427
Yeah, but this is like
a juvie prison camp.

10:45.514 --> 10:49.474
No, this is like spring break
in Cancun compared to juvie.

10:49.561 --> 10:51.955
Wait. You were
in juvenile hall? Seriously?

10:52.042 --> 10:54.436
Yeah. You didn't
read my file?

10:54.523 --> 10:56.307
No. Why, did you
read mine?

10:56.394 --> 10:58.527
Of course.

10:58.614 --> 11:01.791
- What have we got?
- Look at this.

11:09.277 --> 11:10.495
Interesting, huh?

11:12.149 --> 11:14.325
Maybe there's
treasure involved.

11:14.412 --> 11:15.631
Maybe not.

11:15.718 --> 11:17.633
Follow the trail.
Find out.

11:21.942 --> 11:25.815
[female #1]
'So over and under..'

11:25.902 --> 11:27.687
'Over..'

11:27.774 --> 11:29.427
...'and under..'

11:29.514 --> 11:31.081
...and through.

11:31.168 --> 11:33.083
Simple. Again.

11:33.170 --> 11:35.738
'Over and under.'

11:35.825 --> 11:37.653
And over..

11:37.740 --> 11:39.786
'...and under.'

11:39.873 --> 11:42.832
Chris!
Hit the reflection room.

11:46.444 --> 11:48.055
One hour.

11:48.142 --> 11:50.840
- Marley, give me 25.
- But he started it.

11:50.927 --> 11:54.496
Yeah, I hear you,
and I do not care. 25.

11:54.583 --> 11:56.541
Hey, lady!

11:56.628 --> 11:58.326
Are you talking to me?

11:58.413 --> 12:01.895
Yeah, I'm talking to you.
This is important. Look at me.

12:01.982 --> 12:04.854
CBI. That's police.
There'll be no backchat.

12:04.941 --> 12:07.770
- You do exactly as I tell you.
- What?

12:07.857 --> 12:09.076
Hold this.

12:11.731 --> 12:13.863
C-B-I..

12:13.950 --> 12:16.779
...California
bureau of investigation.

12:16.866 --> 12:18.868
Well, ma'am,
we have reason to believe..

12:23.960 --> 12:26.006
[laughter]

12:27.877 --> 12:30.619
[speaks softly]
Untie me this instant.

12:30.706 --> 12:33.317
Sorry, ma'am. Your boss
Mr. Maclean told me to do that.

12:33.404 --> 12:34.666
- No, he didn't.
- Yes, he did.

12:34.754 --> 12:37.104
He's in his office
right now. Go and ask him.

12:37.191 --> 12:40.063
[laughter]

12:44.851 --> 12:46.809
Okay, my people, we have

12:46.896 --> 12:48.855
precious little time
until our friend returns.

12:48.942 --> 12:52.249
I need to know who knows
the most about what around here.

12:52.336 --> 12:54.077
Elliot's been here,
like, two years

12:54.164 --> 12:55.949
so he knows everything.

12:56.036 --> 12:57.689
Wow, that's a long time to be
stuck out in the woods, huh?

12:57.777 --> 12:59.082
I like it here.

12:59.169 --> 13:01.171
Yeah? So what's the deal
with Justin?

13:01.258 --> 13:04.914
- Who disliked him?
- Nobody. He was fine.

13:05.001 --> 13:06.916
Oh, you say that like
he was a prize jerk.

13:07.003 --> 13:10.311
No. He wouldn't win
any prizes.

13:10.398 --> 13:12.008
I mean, he was basically
a good kid

13:12.095 --> 13:15.446
but he just fought a lot
with everybody.

13:15.533 --> 13:17.405
What do you think he was
doing out in the woods?

13:20.321 --> 13:22.236
Who knows?

13:22.323 --> 13:24.978
- The woods are a bad place. -
Yeah? Why is that?

13:25.065 --> 13:26.544
The axman Zachariah
lives there.

13:26.631 --> 13:29.156
[all]
Shh!

13:29.243 --> 13:31.375
Who's Zachariah?

13:31.462 --> 13:33.725
There is no Zachariah.

13:33.813 --> 13:35.902
It's-it's just a story.

13:35.989 --> 13:39.296
- Yeah, I was just kidding.
- No, you weren't.

13:39.383 --> 13:40.732
Come on, guys. Aren't
you a little old

13:40.820 --> 13:42.909
to believe in stuff like that?

13:42.996 --> 13:48.001
A year ago...they found
a townie kid dead in the woods.

13:48.088 --> 13:50.046
He'd been chopped up
with an ax.

13:50.133 --> 13:51.961
His head was 20 feet
up in a tree

13:52.048 --> 13:54.659
with a crazy look
on his face.

13:54.746 --> 13:58.838
Okay. Now does Zachariah have
anything to do with Z Krew?

14:05.235 --> 14:06.497
Was Justin in Z Krew?

14:06.584 --> 14:08.151
[Lisbon]
'Jane?'

14:08.238 --> 14:11.546
Jane! What the hell
are you playing at?

14:11.633 --> 14:14.418
- You can't tie people up.
- Uh, yeah. Sorry.

14:14.505 --> 14:16.072
I should think you would be.

14:16.159 --> 14:18.335
'My apologies, Mr. Maclean.'

14:18.422 --> 14:21.861
We'll be back tomorrow morning
if that's convenient.

14:21.948 --> 14:23.906
See you in the morning.

14:23.993 --> 14:27.910
I hope you got something useful
for all the trouble you caused.

14:27.997 --> 14:30.782
Yes, I did, the story
of the mad axman Zachariah

14:30.870 --> 14:32.393
who lives in these here woods.

14:32.480 --> 14:34.047
- Ah, "Z."
- Yes, "Z."

14:34.134 --> 14:35.309
I would have
gotten more out of 'em,

14:35.396 --> 14:36.919
but you came back too quickly.

14:37.006 --> 14:38.790
Reality check.
I'm your supervising agent.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.314
I'm not your decoy.

14:40.401 --> 14:42.794
[Patrick]
'Whoa!'

14:46.276 --> 14:48.278
So, uh, what did it say?

14:48.365 --> 14:50.063
What?

14:50.150 --> 14:51.978
You know, my file.

14:52.065 --> 14:54.023
You haven't read
your own file?

14:54.110 --> 14:56.852
- No. It's against the rules.
- You're kidding.

14:56.939 --> 14:59.986
What? I like rules. Why be
a cop if you don't like rules?

15:00.073 --> 15:01.857
Come on. What did it say?

15:01.944 --> 15:03.772
You know what it says.
It's your life.

15:03.859 --> 15:05.339
I didn't know you were adopted

15:05.426 --> 15:07.167
but other than that,
no surprises.

15:07.254 --> 15:08.995
Adopted? What?

15:09.082 --> 15:12.694
- Kidding.
- Ha ha. Very funny.

15:12.781 --> 15:15.262
So why were you in juvie?

15:15.349 --> 15:17.568
You know.
The usual reasons.

15:27.796 --> 15:30.581
That has a mark on this map
with a skull and crossbones.

15:30.668 --> 15:33.323
So what are the usual reasons
for being in juvie?

15:33.410 --> 15:35.282
I'll tell you
all about it sometime.

15:38.546 --> 15:40.504
Hey, check this out.

15:46.902 --> 15:49.122
- Looks like Justin's shoe.
- Yep.

15:49.209 --> 15:50.732
I'll call forensics,
mark it up.

15:50.819 --> 15:52.125
Yeah.

15:59.523 --> 16:01.830
- Hello?
- CBI!

16:03.353 --> 16:05.399
Anybody home?

16:05.486 --> 16:07.444
Hello?

16:14.799 --> 16:16.192
CBI!

16:19.195 --> 16:21.067
- Try the other side?
- Yeah.

16:26.637 --> 16:30.337
You move, you die,
you mameluke sons of bitches!

16:35.995 --> 16:37.953
- Kneel down!
- Hey, we're cops.

16:38.040 --> 16:39.433
Kneel!

16:41.130 --> 16:44.525
I'm-a blow your damn faces
off you, you hear?

16:44.612 --> 16:46.309
- Eh, eh, eh! Winston!
- Come on!

16:46.396 --> 16:50.226
Winston, you fool.
Put that gun down. Let go.

16:50.313 --> 16:53.186
[indistinct radio chatter]

16:55.405 --> 16:57.103
- Thank you.
- No problem.

16:57.190 --> 16:59.366
Yeah, thanks.
What are you doing here?

16:59.453 --> 17:02.151
Winston called 9-1-1.
Lucky I was close.

17:03.761 --> 17:06.329
'Can you please tell me
why I'm still here?'

17:06.416 --> 17:08.723
I had nothing to do with
that kid who died. Nothing.

17:08.810 --> 17:10.594
You're here because
you assaulted us.

17:10.681 --> 17:12.466
But if you want to talk about
Justin Prentiss, that's fine.

17:12.553 --> 17:14.598
How am I supposed
to know who you are?

17:14.685 --> 17:17.949
You're bangin' on my doors,
"CBI! CBI!"

17:18.037 --> 17:20.082
like that's supposed
to mean somethin'?

17:20.169 --> 17:22.128
Yeah, we do need
better brand awareness

17:22.215 --> 17:23.564
but your response
was disproportionate.

17:23.651 --> 17:26.480
You brandished a firearm.
So here we are.

17:26.567 --> 17:29.831
[chuckles]
My security alarm went off.

17:29.918 --> 17:32.268
I was loaded. I reacted.

17:32.355 --> 17:33.878
That's all.

17:33.965 --> 17:35.619
You're very security-conscious.
Why is that?

17:35.706 --> 17:39.580
Why not? Are there people
out there who dislike security?

17:39.667 --> 17:40.929
What's been
your history of contact

17:41.016 --> 17:42.365
with the students
from Bright Arch?

17:42.452 --> 17:46.761
Zero. I have a zero history
of contact.

17:54.203 --> 17:56.510
You know the kid who was
killed, Justin Prentiss

17:56.597 --> 17:59.469
who was buried close
to your property line?

17:59.556 --> 18:01.384
He had a sketch map that
showed the way to your house

18:01.471 --> 18:03.212
marked with
a skull and crossbones.

18:03.299 --> 18:04.779
I don't know what that means.

18:04.866 --> 18:06.955
How about Zachariah?
That name ring any bells?

18:07.042 --> 18:08.043
No.

18:11.525 --> 18:13.179
Looks like it's gonna be
a long night.

18:13.266 --> 18:14.963
I just want to be left alone

18:15.050 --> 18:17.792
and I want those kids
to leave me alone!

18:17.879 --> 18:20.403
They go up to my property,
mess with my stuff.

18:20.490 --> 18:23.537
They break windows.
They spray paint my doors

18:23.624 --> 18:26.931
pull all kinds of stunts
all night

18:27.018 --> 18:28.629
like a routine.

18:28.716 --> 18:30.718
Okay. So what did
you do in response?

18:30.805 --> 18:34.461
I did everything to try and stop
them short of actual violence.

18:34.548 --> 18:36.854
I built fences.

18:36.941 --> 18:38.943
I planted poison oak.

18:39.030 --> 18:40.989
I installed alarms.

18:41.076 --> 18:43.209
They just took it all
like it was a game.

18:43.296 --> 18:44.688
Were they at your house
last night?

18:44.775 --> 18:46.516
The night before.

18:46.603 --> 18:51.782
Three or four of 'em, throwing
balloons of red paint.

18:51.869 --> 18:53.567
Would you be able to identify
any of the kids involved

18:53.654 --> 18:54.872
if you saw them again?

18:54.959 --> 18:56.874
They always wore masks.

19:01.052 --> 19:03.881
[birds chirping]

19:12.760 --> 19:13.891
I want to apologize

19:13.978 --> 19:16.024
for the misunderstanding
yesterday.

19:16.111 --> 19:17.765
Mr. Jane will comport himself
properly today.

19:18.766 --> 19:19.941
Yes, I will.

19:23.074 --> 19:25.338
Who's Zachariah?

19:25.425 --> 19:27.514
- Who?
- Zachariah.

19:27.601 --> 19:28.863
Never heard of him.
Who is he?

19:28.950 --> 19:30.560
- Liar.
- Liar?

19:30.647 --> 19:33.563
Pants on fire.
They're ablaze.

19:33.650 --> 19:35.565
I want to cooperate
with you people

19:35.652 --> 19:37.524
but this man is trying to..
I don't know what

19:37.611 --> 19:38.960
he is trying to do,
but I resent it.

19:39.047 --> 19:40.483
You should know that you sound

19:40.570 --> 19:42.137
more than a little paranoid
when you talk---

19:42.224 --> 19:44.444
This is what I'm talking about.
How is this police work?

19:44.531 --> 19:46.794
Oh, I'm kidding with you.
I get bored.

19:46.881 --> 19:49.144
See, the thing is,
you have heard of Zachariah.

19:49.231 --> 19:52.452
You know who Zachariah is,
and you're scared of Zachariah.

19:52.539 --> 19:53.975
And we're gonna find out why.

19:54.062 --> 19:57.021
Let's put a pin in that,
shall we?

19:57.108 --> 19:59.415
We have information
putting Justin Prentiss

19:59.502 --> 20:01.765
at Mr. Winston's house
the night he went AWOL.

20:01.852 --> 20:04.290
He went up there on a regular
basis with a group of kids

20:04.377 --> 20:06.117
to torment Mr. Winston.

20:06.205 --> 20:08.729
So says Mr. Winston.
Has he any proof?

20:08.816 --> 20:10.165
Why would he lie?

20:10.252 --> 20:12.559
Because he's a crazy
old man with a..

20:12.646 --> 20:14.125
...with a grudge
against this school.

20:14.213 --> 20:16.258
Perhaps he's crazy enough
to do something.

20:16.345 --> 20:19.479
He's complained plenty of times.
There's never any reality to it.

20:19.566 --> 20:21.524
Chief Brody disagrees.

20:21.611 --> 20:23.700
She thinks that some of
your students are vandals

20:23.787 --> 20:25.398
and you're protecting them.

20:25.485 --> 20:29.140
Chief Brody is a small town cop.
She gets ideas in her head.

20:29.228 --> 20:32.318
Look, the truth is that nobody
around here likes us very much.

20:32.405 --> 20:35.190
They think the kids are all
drug addicts and delinquents.

20:35.277 --> 20:36.974
They're scared.

20:37.061 --> 20:38.889
You don't mind if we sit down
with some of your students

20:38.976 --> 20:41.152
to ask them about
Mr. Winston's allegations?

20:41.240 --> 20:44.068
[sighs]
Not at all..

20:44.155 --> 20:48.682
As long as you follow
proper legal protocol.

20:50.510 --> 20:53.208
Of course.

20:53.295 --> 20:55.819
Hey, hey, hey!

20:55.906 --> 20:57.952
Agent Lisbon of the CBI

20:58.039 --> 20:59.910
would like to talk to you
for a moment.

20:59.997 --> 21:03.871
Let's all listen with
respectful attention, alright?

21:09.137 --> 21:11.052
Jane, they're all yours.

21:14.577 --> 21:17.450
- Hello, kids.
- Hey.

21:17.537 --> 21:19.452
Uh, that's the best you got?

21:19.539 --> 21:20.670
Hello, kids.

21:20.757 --> 21:22.281
[in unison]
Hello!

21:22.368 --> 21:23.760
Ah, thank you. Thank you.

21:26.110 --> 21:28.939
Ahh.
Who wants to see some magic?

21:29.026 --> 21:34.205
Hands? Good.

21:34.293 --> 21:36.033
Watch me closely.

21:40.647 --> 21:42.301
Concentrate.

21:45.608 --> 21:47.741
Make sure I don't do
anything sneaky.

21:47.828 --> 21:50.221
- Alright, this is ridiculous.
- Hush.

21:50.309 --> 21:52.354
Watching my hands..

22:00.231 --> 22:02.103
I'm gonna need a volunteer.

22:04.105 --> 22:05.367
You.

22:07.282 --> 22:09.284
Stand up. Come here.

22:15.116 --> 22:17.379
- Name?
- Orrin.

22:17.466 --> 22:19.250
Well, Orrin,
today's your lucky day.

22:19.338 --> 22:20.817
I'm going to look
into your mind

22:20.904 --> 22:22.253
and I'm gonna
read your thoughts.

22:23.994 --> 22:26.649
[instrumental music]

22:32.307 --> 22:34.918
Ahh.

22:35.005 --> 22:38.313
You're thinking, "gosh, I hope
he can't read my thoughts

22:38.400 --> 22:40.576
"because then he'd know
that I was up in the woods

22:40.663 --> 22:43.405
"with Justin Prentiss
the night before he died

22:43.492 --> 22:46.321
throwing paint bombs
at the old crazy man's door."

22:51.413 --> 22:54.373
Oh. Orrin, that was
kind of dumb.

22:54.460 --> 22:55.374
You should've thought
of something

22:55.461 --> 22:57.332
a little more innocent.
Uh..

23:00.814 --> 23:02.381
we're gonna have
to have a little talk.

23:05.732 --> 23:07.211
Follow me.

23:07.298 --> 23:10.824
[clears throat]
Sorry about that.

23:10.911 --> 23:11.912
Come on.

23:11.999 --> 23:13.870
[murmuring]

23:21.356 --> 23:23.402
[Patrick]
'Tell me more
about Zachariah.'

23:23.489 --> 23:26.970
Orrin, you may ask
for a lawyer at any time.

23:27.057 --> 23:28.363
Then my parents
will know, right?

23:28.450 --> 23:30.452
Yes.

23:30.539 --> 23:32.149
That's okay.

23:32.236 --> 23:35.196
Zachariah and the Z Krew.

23:35.283 --> 23:38.329
Why should I tell you?
You know what I'm thinking.

23:38.417 --> 23:41.115
Yeah. But it would be
more polite

23:41.202 --> 23:44.292
if you said it aloud
for their benefit.

23:44.379 --> 23:47.861
You can't really
read minds, can you?

23:47.948 --> 23:50.124
Shrewd insight.
No, of course I can't.

23:50.211 --> 23:52.735
Then how'd you do that, then?
Call me out like that?

23:52.822 --> 23:54.302
You scratched
your poison oak rash

23:54.389 --> 23:55.695
and my colleagues tell me

23:55.782 --> 23:58.001
that only grows
in one place around here.

23:58.088 --> 23:59.655
Up at Mr. Winston's.

23:59.742 --> 24:01.091
[whispers]
Fudge.

24:01.178 --> 24:04.791
Yeah. So tell me more
about Zachariah.

24:04.878 --> 24:08.403
- I can't.
- Really?

24:08.490 --> 24:10.710
Orrin, we can
let this go

24:10.797 --> 24:12.668
or we can take it
to the next level.

24:12.755 --> 24:14.975
And that's gonna involve
your parents and lawyers.

24:20.154 --> 24:22.069
- Zachariah was a lumberjack..
- Hm-hmm.

24:22.156 --> 24:23.897
[Orrin]
'Hundreds of years ago.'

24:23.984 --> 24:27.161
'A log fell on him in the river
and pinned him by the arm.'

24:27.248 --> 24:30.991
His logging crew tried,
but they couldn't get him out.

24:31.078 --> 24:33.341
The river was rising,
and a snowstorm was coming.

24:33.428 --> 24:35.778
They figured that he was
done for anyway.

24:35.865 --> 24:38.999
So they left him there,
left him for dead.

24:39.086 --> 24:41.610
'Zachariah was so angry
at them for leaving him'

24:41.697 --> 24:43.873
'that he chopped off
his own arm to free himself'

24:43.960 --> 24:45.701
'then went back
to the lumber camp'

24:45.788 --> 24:48.835
and hacked every one
of his workmates to death

24:48.922 --> 24:51.620
then chopped 'em up
and put their heads in trees.

24:51.707 --> 24:53.274
Cool.

24:53.361 --> 24:54.710
The lumber camp
where they died..

24:54.797 --> 24:55.885
Hm-hmm.

24:55.972 --> 24:58.801
This is it. Right here.

24:58.888 --> 25:01.238
This school
is the exact same spot.

25:01.325 --> 25:03.284
[door opens]
Wow.

25:03.371 --> 25:06.679
- And Z Krew?
- It's like a secret club.

25:06.766 --> 25:08.985
We go up in the woods
and do stuff.

25:09.072 --> 25:10.509
Zachariah is like
our leader.

25:12.380 --> 25:15.165
- Who's like the deputy leader?
- I don't know.

25:15.252 --> 25:17.037
- No?
- Come on.

25:17.124 --> 25:19.300
We wear masks.
The only person you know

25:19.387 --> 25:21.389
is the person who asked you
to join the gang.

25:21.476 --> 25:22.651
Who was that?

25:26.002 --> 25:27.438
Bryan.

25:27.526 --> 25:30.180
[footsteps approaching]

25:30.267 --> 25:31.834
There he is.

25:31.921 --> 25:33.575
- I got this.
- No, please. I got this.

25:36.709 --> 25:38.101
After you.

25:39.233 --> 25:42.149
[intense music]

25:45.892 --> 25:46.980
Uhh!

25:48.677 --> 25:51.158
Nice.

25:51.245 --> 25:52.986
Who initiated you
to Z Krew, Bryan?

25:53.073 --> 25:54.814
The guy that jumped me in
left last year.

25:54.901 --> 25:56.642
- Who runs Z Krew?
- I don't know.

25:56.729 --> 25:57.904
I find it
hard to believe

25:57.991 --> 25:59.819
you didn't recognize
anybody's voice.

25:59.906 --> 26:01.690
There's no talking
on Z Krew ops.

26:01.777 --> 26:04.084
We only communicate
by note and sign language.

26:04.171 --> 26:06.042
That's the whole fun of it.

26:06.129 --> 26:08.523
Look, Z Krew's
about running around

26:08.610 --> 26:10.786
in the woods,
playing warriors.

26:10.873 --> 26:12.571
Nobody gets killed.

26:12.658 --> 26:15.008
Z Krew's got nothing to do
with Justin's murder.

26:15.095 --> 26:16.575
Do you?

26:16.662 --> 26:17.706
No!

26:20.230 --> 26:22.015
You want my guess?

26:22.102 --> 26:25.714
Guesswork is inappropriate for
this sort of situation, Bryan.

26:25.801 --> 26:27.890
Guesswork's okay.

26:27.977 --> 26:29.413
[sighs]

26:29.500 --> 26:32.416
Cassie.

26:32.503 --> 26:35.115
- She's in it somehow.
- How so?

26:35.202 --> 26:36.551
Justin was..

26:36.638 --> 26:37.813
[scoffs]

26:37.900 --> 26:39.772
...he was big
in love with her.

26:39.859 --> 26:42.862
She wouldn't deal,
and he didn't like it.

26:42.949 --> 26:45.168
I saw them arguing

26:45.255 --> 26:47.040
both real mad,
a couple days ago.

26:47.127 --> 26:49.999
And now she's totally
freaked out about his death.

26:50.086 --> 26:52.523
So, you know..

26:52.611 --> 26:54.874
Many of us
are upset, Bryan.

26:54.961 --> 26:58.094
- Does Cassie have a boyfriend?
- No.

26:58.181 --> 27:00.880
So what do you think happened?
Cassie killed him?

27:00.967 --> 27:03.099
[scoffs]
That's ridiculous.

27:03.186 --> 27:05.319
Let him answer.

27:05.406 --> 27:07.974
Hey, ask her.

27:08.061 --> 27:10.498
All I'm saying,
it wasn't me.

27:12.195 --> 27:14.545
Do you know where we can
find Cassie right now?

27:14.633 --> 27:16.591
I'm sure that she has
nothing to do with this.

27:18.637 --> 27:21.727
But I will have someone
fetch her for you.

27:27.515 --> 27:28.777
Gave you a little
trouble, huh?

27:28.864 --> 27:30.736
Nah.

27:30.823 --> 27:32.172
Hey, guys.

27:32.259 --> 27:33.826
[muttering]

27:33.913 --> 27:36.176
- What happened to you?
- Old age.

27:36.263 --> 27:37.960
Shut up, you.

27:38.047 --> 27:39.353
What are you doing here?

27:39.440 --> 27:40.789
Gee, thanks
for the welcome.

27:40.876 --> 27:42.704
No, I mean,
you know what I mean.

27:42.791 --> 27:44.663
Lisbon wanted an extra hand if
we're gonna have to interview

27:44.750 --> 27:46.882
all the students
and staff.

27:46.969 --> 27:49.276
Seriously?
This is the biggest they had?

27:49.363 --> 27:50.407
[Lisbon]
'Hey, Van Pelt.'

27:50.494 --> 27:52.018
Hey, boss.

27:52.105 --> 27:54.411
We're short a girl
by the name Cassie Miniver.

27:54.498 --> 27:56.370
'Bryan says that Justin
was in love with Cassie'

27:56.457 --> 27:58.415
'recently saw them
in a fierce argument.'

27:58.502 --> 28:01.549
Oh, Cassie. Yeah, she brought
MacLean a cup of tea.

28:01.636 --> 28:03.725
Yeah. We wanted to question her,
but she's gone.

28:03.812 --> 28:05.596
Hmm. Interesting.

28:05.684 --> 28:08.425
-Anybody else missing?
- No, there isn't.

28:08.512 --> 28:10.776
So she's most likely running,
not abducted.

28:10.863 --> 28:13.213
- Precisely.
- So what do you think, boss?

28:13.300 --> 28:15.606
[Lisbon]
'Chief Brody's setting up a
full-scale search so we should'

28:15.694 --> 28:17.608
'probably start looking
in the woods around the school.'

28:17.696 --> 28:19.436
Oh, that sounds
horribly tedious.

28:19.523 --> 28:20.611
Shout if you need me.

28:22.091 --> 28:25.051
Go ahead, relax.
Enjoy yourself.

28:25.138 --> 28:27.227
'God forbid you should
do anything tedious.'

28:31.753 --> 28:33.146
Cassie!

28:33.233 --> 28:34.582
- 'Cassie!'
- 'Cassie!'

28:34.669 --> 28:36.453
-Cassie!
- Cassie!

28:36.540 --> 28:37.803
[Brody]
'Cassie!'

28:37.890 --> 28:39.805
- Cassie!
- Cassie!

28:41.110 --> 28:44.635
- 'Cassie!'

28:44.723 --> 28:47.160
- Can I ask you something?
- Mm-hmm.

28:47.247 --> 28:49.771
Would you,
have you ever read

28:49.858 --> 28:52.339
your coworker's
personnel files?

28:52.426 --> 28:55.603
Uh, no. Why?

28:55.690 --> 28:58.693
No, uh, good.
Neither did I. Good.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.306
[birds chirping]

29:08.181 --> 29:11.053
[vehicle approaching]

29:15.362 --> 29:17.712
[intense music]

29:24.197 --> 29:27.417
Hey.

29:27.504 --> 29:28.941
Hi.

29:29.028 --> 29:31.378
Where are you headed?

29:31.465 --> 29:32.988
Uh, into town.

29:33.075 --> 29:35.034
Excellent. That's exactly
where I need to go.

29:37.166 --> 29:38.385
Alright.

29:39.865 --> 29:42.258
[intense music]

29:45.044 --> 29:46.654
Thanks. Grateful.

29:49.091 --> 29:51.615
[music continues]

29:59.885 --> 30:01.669
Would you shut the gate
for me, please?

30:01.756 --> 30:05.368
- Uh, nope.
- Why?

30:05.455 --> 30:06.979
Well, 'cause as soon
as I get out of the car

30:07.066 --> 30:09.285
then you'll drive away
without me.

30:09.372 --> 30:12.941
[chuckles]
Why on Earth
would I do that?

30:13.028 --> 30:14.725
The three furies.

30:14.813 --> 30:16.336
Fear, shame, guilt.

30:16.423 --> 30:17.772
What?

30:17.859 --> 30:19.992
The heart wants
what the heart wants

30:20.079 --> 30:24.474
and it won't be denied.
It makes us do bad things.

30:24.561 --> 30:27.042
What are you
talking about?

30:27.129 --> 30:28.652
Cassie, I have
a gift for you.

30:34.223 --> 30:36.486
Cassie? Needn't be shy.

30:37.444 --> 30:40.055
[intense music]

30:42.318 --> 30:43.754
Hi.

30:43.842 --> 30:44.843
Hi.

30:48.498 --> 30:49.630
Here.

30:53.808 --> 30:54.896
Try it on.

31:02.425 --> 31:03.513
Beautiful.

31:10.042 --> 31:12.740
[intense music]

31:23.229 --> 31:25.274
Ta-da.

31:25.361 --> 31:27.015
What is this?

31:27.102 --> 31:29.365
Mr. MacLean was helping
Cassie run away.

31:30.714 --> 31:32.238
Why?

31:32.325 --> 31:34.849
He didn't want us
to speak to her because...

31:34.936 --> 31:36.372
I have nothing to say.

31:36.459 --> 31:39.462
Nonsense. You have
plenty to say.

31:39.549 --> 31:41.856
He wanted her to go before
we get a chance to talk to her

31:41.943 --> 31:44.903
and find out that
she and he were having..

31:44.990 --> 31:48.428
...what you would call,
uh, sexual relations.

31:50.169 --> 31:51.257
Is that true?

31:51.344 --> 31:53.085
I'm saying nothing.
I admit nothing.

31:53.172 --> 31:55.478
I want to talk
to my lawyer. Cassie!

31:55.565 --> 31:57.654
Don't say anything.

31:57.741 --> 31:59.656
You miserable
little pervert!

31:59.743 --> 32:01.789
- That's enough, chief.
- She assaulted me!

32:01.876 --> 32:04.400
I don't think so.
We're going back to Sacramento.

32:04.487 --> 32:06.533
'Now you can either come
of your own accord'

32:06.620 --> 32:08.883
or we can arrest you.
Which is it?

32:11.973 --> 32:13.105
Fine.

32:15.455 --> 32:16.586
Good choice.

32:22.810 --> 32:24.986
No. We didn't.

32:25.073 --> 32:26.335
We-we weren't. No.

32:28.685 --> 32:30.949
Cassie, look at me.

32:31.036 --> 32:32.733
It's very easy
to see when you're lying.

32:32.820 --> 32:36.258
You get a little pulse going
in your neck just there. Yeah.

32:37.738 --> 32:39.958
Always best to tell
Agent Lisbon the truth.

32:42.612 --> 32:44.963
Did Mr. MacLean have
sexual relations with you?

32:49.576 --> 32:50.707
It's okay.

32:52.318 --> 32:54.363
Yes, he did.

32:54.450 --> 32:56.191
One time or more than that?

32:56.278 --> 32:58.454
More.

32:58.541 --> 33:01.414
Maybe twice a week
for a few months.

33:01.501 --> 33:03.938
You know that by having
sexual relations with you

33:04.025 --> 33:07.072
Mr. MacLean was committing
a crime, right?

33:07.159 --> 33:08.508
I guess.

33:08.595 --> 33:10.597
Was it consensual?

33:10.684 --> 33:12.729
I guess.

33:12.816 --> 33:14.383
[Lisbon]
'You guess.'

33:14.470 --> 33:17.386
Uh, did you want Mr. MacLean
to have sex with you?

33:17.473 --> 33:19.214
No, ma'am.

33:19.301 --> 33:22.000
So he coerced you.

33:22.087 --> 33:24.089
No, ma'am.

33:24.176 --> 33:27.048
- I don't understand.
- I was scared.

33:27.135 --> 33:29.920
Scared of who?
Mr. Maclean?

33:30.008 --> 33:33.054
No, he's just
a sad creep.

33:33.141 --> 33:34.534
Who, then?

33:38.668 --> 33:41.541
you can talk freely, Cassie.
You're safe here.

33:41.628 --> 33:43.108
Nowhere is safe.

33:43.195 --> 33:44.370
Zachariah made you do it?

33:47.634 --> 33:50.724
Zombie lumberjack made you
sleep with Mr. MacLean.

33:50.811 --> 33:52.595
He told me I had to.

33:52.682 --> 33:56.077
Cassie, you know that
Zachariah doesn't exist.

33:56.164 --> 33:59.167
You know that kid that they
found chopped up in the woods?

33:59.254 --> 34:01.343
He thought the same thing.

34:01.430 --> 34:04.042
Okay, how-how does Zachariah
tell you his wishes?

34:07.654 --> 34:09.308
Through somebody
from Z Krew, maybe?

34:09.395 --> 34:11.049
I've said too much already.
I don't--

34:11.136 --> 34:12.528
I don't want
to say anymore.

34:12.615 --> 34:14.487
[sniffles]
Please don't make me.

34:17.098 --> 34:19.535
I'll be right back.

34:19.622 --> 34:22.060
[sniffling]

34:23.017 --> 34:25.498
[intense music]

34:29.241 --> 34:31.156
Cassie made a statement.

34:31.243 --> 34:33.593
Charge Mr. MacLean
with statutory rape.

34:33.680 --> 34:34.811
Will do, boss.

34:40.904 --> 34:43.994
Sex with a minor.
Tell you what--

34:44.082 --> 34:45.692
Things look very bad
for you right now.

34:45.779 --> 34:48.260
I was kind and caring
to a troubled girl.

34:48.347 --> 34:49.739
That--that's all. I--

34:49.826 --> 34:51.524
Yeah, that's what
they all say..

34:51.611 --> 34:53.308
...until the lab tests
come back.

34:53.395 --> 34:54.701
'See, the way we have
to figure this'

34:54.788 --> 34:56.833
is that Justin Prentiss
was in love with Cassie

34:56.920 --> 34:58.008
and found out that
you were abusing her.

34:58.096 --> 34:59.271
- Oh, please.
- Abusing her.

34:59.358 --> 35:01.360
And he threatened
to tell the authorities.

35:01.447 --> 35:03.231
So you clubbed him to death,
you thought, and buried him.

35:03.318 --> 35:05.538
- No. No!
- No?

35:05.625 --> 35:07.888
Well, that's what
we're thinking.

35:10.891 --> 35:12.980
How are we wrong?

35:13.067 --> 35:14.329
Did he attack you?

35:14.416 --> 35:16.418
Was it self-defense, maybe?

35:16.505 --> 35:21.858
I want my lawyer. I'm saying
nothing more to you people.

35:21.945 --> 35:23.991
We got nothing to put him
with Justin that night.

35:24.078 --> 35:26.167
We need a confession.

35:26.254 --> 35:27.429
You won't get one.

35:27.516 --> 35:28.822
[Cho]
'Why won't we get one?'

35:28.909 --> 35:31.303
Prize for the first one
to tell me the answer.

35:31.390 --> 35:33.566
Just tell us
your damn theory.

35:33.653 --> 35:36.221
I will do that on our way
back to Bright Arch.

35:36.308 --> 35:38.484
We need to get there in time
for the sacred fire ritual.

35:38.571 --> 35:40.007
Rigsby, let's you and I

35:40.094 --> 35:41.791
have a quick cup of tea
then we'll go, huh?

35:41.878 --> 35:43.271
Explain first.
Then we'll go.

35:44.925 --> 35:48.276
Sacred fire?

35:48.363 --> 35:50.583
[Patrick]
'Hello, kids.'

35:50.670 --> 35:54.282
Good to see you all again.

35:54.369 --> 35:57.546
Pretty dramatic
few days, huh?

35:57.633 --> 35:59.287
You probably heard
a lot of crazy stuff

35:59.374 --> 36:01.420
about what's been going on.

36:01.507 --> 36:03.726
Well, don't worry about it.

36:04.814 --> 36:07.600
Life goes on.

36:07.687 --> 36:09.428
'Your teachers thought
I'd be good to carry on'

36:09.515 --> 36:11.386
with the sacred
fire ceremony as usual.

36:11.473 --> 36:14.128
Everyone okay with that?

36:14.215 --> 36:16.696
Excellent.

36:16.783 --> 36:19.786
I thought we'd start
with a ghost story.

36:19.873 --> 36:21.483
You all know
about Zachariah, yeah?

36:21.570 --> 36:23.529
We do.

36:23.616 --> 36:25.313
But we don't talk
about him.

36:25.400 --> 36:28.142
- It's bad luck.
- Meh.

36:28.229 --> 36:29.796
Zachariah doesn't scare me.

36:31.841 --> 36:34.366
So everyone knows
about that terrible evening

36:34.453 --> 36:38.892
when Zachariah hacked his former
friends to pieces, yeah?

36:38.979 --> 36:40.850
'What a lot of people
don't know'

36:40.937 --> 36:43.592
is what happened
after that horrible incident.

36:43.679 --> 36:46.204
[fire crackling]

36:49.294 --> 36:54.299
as punishment, the townspeople
gathered together

36:54.386 --> 36:57.040
and built a huge bonfire..

36:57.127 --> 36:59.347
...right here..

36:59.434 --> 37:01.131
...on this very spot.

37:01.219 --> 37:05.266
And they burned
Zachariah alive.

37:05.353 --> 37:09.792
'And as the flames melted
the flesh from his body'

37:09.879 --> 37:12.012
Zachariah didn't scream.

37:12.099 --> 37:15.058
He just smiled
at those watching.

37:15.145 --> 37:18.845
'And he made a solemn vow'

37:18.932 --> 37:22.631
that whenever someone
does evil in these woods

37:22.718 --> 37:26.244
'if you call Zachariah's name
three times'

37:26.331 --> 37:28.550
and mark the ground
with a "Z" then he will rise

37:28.637 --> 37:30.726
from the grave
and he will take them.

37:30.813 --> 37:31.945
Yeah, right.

37:37.298 --> 37:39.213
And if the sinner doesn't
confess his sins

37:39.300 --> 37:42.651
if he doesn't repent, then
Zachariah will drag them down

37:42.738 --> 37:45.132
into his ghastly lair

37:45.219 --> 37:49.745
to suffer with him in black
darkness for all eternity.

37:49.832 --> 37:52.270
[scoffs]
That's it?

37:52.357 --> 37:53.793
Yes, that's it.

37:53.880 --> 37:55.142
That was weak, dude.

37:59.712 --> 38:03.193
Well, it's only weak
if the curse isn't true.

38:03.281 --> 38:06.327
'And we all know that evil
has been done in these woods.'

38:08.764 --> 38:11.985
But is there anyone here willing
to call Zachariah's name?

38:15.380 --> 38:16.511
Anyone?

38:20.646 --> 38:22.038
Zachariah!

38:24.606 --> 38:27.609
Zachariah!

38:27.696 --> 38:29.002
Zachariah!

38:35.400 --> 38:37.140
Told you. Weak.

38:39.055 --> 38:41.014
You forgot
the most important part.

38:44.800 --> 38:46.846
You have to mark
the ground with a "Z."

38:48.413 --> 38:51.329
[intense music]

39:08.607 --> 39:10.260
Guess he's on vacation.

39:10.348 --> 39:12.001
Aah! Aah!

39:12.088 --> 39:14.264
Aah! Aah! Aah!

39:15.222 --> 39:16.658
Aah! Aah!

39:16.745 --> 39:19.444
- Elliott, was it you?
- Aah! Aah!

39:19.531 --> 39:20.967
Did you kill Justin?

39:21.054 --> 39:23.361
[grunting]

39:23.448 --> 39:24.840
Elliott, this is
your last chance.

39:24.927 --> 39:27.669
- Did you kill Justin?
- Yes! Yes, it was me!

39:28.670 --> 39:29.758
Phew!

39:31.717 --> 39:33.414
Saved. That was close.

39:39.289 --> 39:41.422
- Oh, hey, Rigsby.
- Hey.

39:41.509 --> 39:44.382
[all laughing]

39:45.600 --> 39:47.559
I-I-I knew it was a joke.

39:47.646 --> 39:49.299
I-I was just kidding.

39:49.387 --> 39:51.606
No, you're a liar
and a murderer, Elliot.

39:51.693 --> 39:52.999
Everyone can see that.

39:55.175 --> 39:56.872
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
a little help here.

39:56.959 --> 39:58.396
[grunting]
Give it up, kid.
Come on. It's over.

40:01.442 --> 40:03.705
[chuckles]

40:03.792 --> 40:05.359
[Elliot]
'Justin was an insect.'

40:05.446 --> 40:07.274
He shouldn't
have interfered.

40:07.361 --> 40:10.320
[Patrick]
'Yes. You had a sweet,
little system going.'

40:10.408 --> 40:12.845
You kept the kids in line
with messages from Zachariah

40:12.932 --> 40:16.326
'and you kept MacLean
in line with blackmail.'

40:16.414 --> 40:18.981
Protect Elliot
and let the Z Krew rule

40:19.068 --> 40:21.375
or be exposed
as a habitual rapist.

40:21.462 --> 40:22.898
You're a very clever
young man.

40:22.985 --> 40:25.118
Yes, I am.

40:25.205 --> 40:27.425
That's why my parents
abandoned me in this dump.

40:29.557 --> 40:31.733
I'm too clever for them.

40:31.820 --> 40:33.735
And for you.

40:33.822 --> 40:35.737
You haven't really
caught me.

40:35.824 --> 40:38.261
I'm a minor. Nothing bad
will happen to me.

40:38.348 --> 40:40.568
Then why don't you tell us
why you killed Justin?

40:40.655 --> 40:42.091
For the record.

40:42.178 --> 40:45.051
You know why.

40:45.138 --> 40:48.184
Justin was always
soft on Cassie.

40:48.271 --> 40:49.969
But when he found out

40:50.056 --> 40:53.407
what she was doing
with MacLean on my order..

40:53.494 --> 40:56.671
he got angry, threatened
to ruin everything.

40:56.758 --> 41:00.370
And I tried to shut him up with a message from Zachariah.

41:00.458 --> 41:02.547
He wouldn't back off.

41:02.634 --> 41:03.896
He laughed at me.

41:03.983 --> 41:05.288
[laughing]

41:06.855 --> 41:08.291
He shouldn't have done that.

41:08.378 --> 41:09.641
[thud]

41:13.383 --> 41:14.689
I don't like
being laughed at.

41:17.692 --> 41:18.998
Hmm.

41:19.085 --> 41:21.479
Well, goodbye, Elliot.

41:21.566 --> 41:23.002
[clears throat]

41:23.089 --> 41:24.351
h-hey!

41:27.136 --> 41:28.311
How did you know
it was me?

41:29.704 --> 41:30.618
[sighs]

41:32.533 --> 41:35.493
when Cassie brought MacLean tea in a cup with Z's on it

41:35.580 --> 41:37.451
that was a warning from you
to keep his mouth shut.

41:37.538 --> 41:39.932
You were the first to bring
forth the Zachariah story

41:40.019 --> 41:42.021
and you've been at this school
longer than anyone else

41:42.108 --> 41:43.413
with no desire to leave.

41:43.501 --> 41:46.634
The sacred fire ceremony
confirmed my hunch.

41:46.721 --> 41:49.202
Everybody else was scared that I was invoking Zachariah

41:49.289 --> 41:52.248
but you-you were
contemptuous and cynical.

41:52.335 --> 41:55.774
'A true artist watching
a cheap imitator..'

41:55.861 --> 41:58.951
...until fear
made you a believer.

41:59.038 --> 42:00.256
[chuckles]

42:00.343 --> 42:01.954
It can do that to you.

42:02.041 --> 42:03.172
Bye.

42:05.958 --> 42:07.002
Sit down.

42:10.571 --> 42:12.094
[Mr. Prentiss]
'I appreciate
everything that you've done.'

42:12.181 --> 42:14.706
[Van Pelt]
'It's our job.'

42:14.793 --> 42:16.011
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

42:19.145 --> 42:21.277
Oh, there he is.

42:21.364 --> 42:22.627
Uh, here I am.

42:25.804 --> 42:28.546
I was just telling
Mr. and Mrs. Prentiss

42:28.633 --> 42:30.852
'it was you that found
their son's killer.'

42:30.939 --> 42:33.986
Yes, uh, I'm very sorry
for your loss.

42:34.073 --> 42:35.814
Thank you.

42:35.901 --> 42:38.773
Thank you so much.

42:38.860 --> 42:40.470
We're very grateful.

42:40.558 --> 42:42.821
It gives us some kind
of closure at least.

42:49.697 --> 42:52.395
Your son died bravely.

42:52.482 --> 42:53.658
He saved a young girl
in trouble.

42:53.745 --> 42:55.224
You should be very proud.

42:56.748 --> 42:59.272
[instrumental music]

43:04.930 --> 43:07.454
[indistinct chattering]
