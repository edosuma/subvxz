OSWALD: You were the one time
I let love weaken me.

00:29.550 --> 00:32.668
I want you around as
a constant reminder to never

00:32.705 --> 00:34.037
make that mistake again.

00:38.744 --> 00:40.010

00:40.045 --> 00:41.211
You don't give a damn about Alfred,

00:41.247 --> 00:42.780
and you sure as hell
don't care about me.

00:42.815 --> 00:43.847
I know you better than that.

00:43.883 --> 00:45.182
I thought you did.

GORDON: Jonathan Crane's father
made a toxin

00:49.054 --> 00:51.455
- while they experienced terror.
- (screams)

00:51.490 --> 00:53.891
- What do you want?
- I'm tired of just surviving.

00:53.926 --> 00:55.225
I want more.

00:59.064 --> 01:00.197
I'm sorry, Alfred.

01:00.232 --> 01:02.866
I've been trying to find
who I am for so long.

01:02.902 --> 01:04.233
Who am I supposed to be?

01:04.269 --> 01:05.570
- Money! Now!
- (gasps)

01:09.443 --> 01:12.177

your true north.

Oh, I was just passing by.

04:26.386 --> 04:28.678
Heard the ruckus.

04:29.489 --> 04:31.522
You know you can't commit
a crime in Gotham now

04:31.553 --> 04:33.917
without a license from Penguin, right?

04:34.139 --> 04:36.061
Is that right?

04:37.764 --> 04:41.011
Well, we just started it,
so word's still getting out.

04:41.066 --> 04:44.000
We ain't kicking half our take
to that little creep.

04:46.171 --> 04:50.110

04:50.342 --> 04:52.399
Maybe you ain't noticed,
but there's, uh,

04:52.721 --> 04:54.754

05:43.756 --> 05:45.856
You know, we appreciate all you've done.

05:46.795 --> 05:48.420
Do you?

05:49.842 --> 05:52.558
Three months ago, following
the Tetch incident,

05:52.842 --> 05:54.735
this city was in flames.

05:54.929 --> 05:58.813
I came to you and offered
to cut crime in half,

05:58.933 --> 06:00.867
and I delivered.

06:01.035 --> 06:04.240
Violent crime is down 57%.

06:04.302 --> 06:06.005
BURKE: But now you want to, uh,

06:06.040 --> 06:09.553
literally, unionize crime.

06:09.663 --> 06:12.532
- I mean, but we can't possibly...
- Quiet!

06:13.815 --> 06:15.147
(exhales)

06:21.410 --> 06:25.207
I remember when I sat there,
in the mayor's chair.

06:25.937 --> 06:27.102
I do not envy you.

06:29.742 --> 06:31.130
Nor you.

06:31.172 --> 06:34.266
Commissioner of police in
a city notorious for crime.

06:34.484 --> 06:36.566
That's why I want to help.

06:36.671 --> 06:41.550
But, uh, we are fully aware
of all you've done.

06:41.602 --> 06:43.035
Are you?

06:44.674 --> 06:46.241
What do you think really happened

06:46.303 --> 06:49.327
to those hordes of criminals
who once prowled our streets?

06:49.450 --> 06:51.083
I'll tell you. I hunted them down...

06:51.108 --> 06:53.607
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
- I made Gotham safe.

06:54.981 --> 06:56.648
Me.

06:58.045 --> 07:02.828
But this is Gotham City;
there will always be crime.

07:04.599 --> 07:08.330
What I am offering is crime
in the hands of professionals.

07:08.436 --> 07:10.669
And held to agreed-upon terms.

07:10.705 --> 07:13.339
From which you'll profit.

07:14.575 --> 07:16.408
God bless America.

07:16.807 --> 07:18.577
You have a choice:

07:18.986 --> 07:24.051
an era of calm and prosperity...

07:24.752 --> 07:27.052
...or a return to the good old days.

07:27.192 --> 07:29.321
And they will return.

07:29.488 --> 07:32.049
With a vengeance.

07:32.293 --> 07:34.994
We deny everything to the press.

07:35.029 --> 07:36.529
Hmm.

07:36.564 --> 07:40.100
What you need to worry about
is the GCPD.

07:40.459 --> 07:44.243
When one of your officers finds
someone committing a crime,

07:44.775 --> 07:49.341
if that person has a license,
they walk away.

07:50.791 --> 07:53.901
Three percent each. Uh, from the take.

07:53.955 --> 07:55.658
Two to split between you.

07:55.713 --> 07:57.094
- Two and a half.
- One!

07:57.119 --> 07:59.672
- You...
- Yes. Fine. Done.

07:59.818 --> 08:01.617
Excellent.

08:02.490 --> 08:04.290
Well, if you'll excuse me,

08:04.469 --> 08:07.600
I have to go prepare for the
grand opening of my new club,

08:07.653 --> 08:10.209
- the Iceberg Lounge.
- Good luck.

08:10.398 --> 08:13.399
Smile, gentlemen. It's a new day.

08:27.348 --> 08:29.081
Hey, Frank.

08:29.116 --> 08:30.816
Morning, Jim.

08:30.852 --> 08:32.885
I'll get you coffee in a second.

08:32.919 --> 08:34.986
Sure.

08:35.022 --> 08:36.989
Morning.

08:37.024 --> 08:38.691
Morning.

08:41.028 --> 08:42.760
Everything okay, Frank?

08:42.797 --> 08:44.396
MAN: Everything's fine, copper.

08:44.432 --> 08:46.498
I got a license.

08:46.534 --> 08:48.033
Penguin approved.

08:51.606 --> 08:53.606
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

08:59.680 --> 09:02.132
I'll take that coffee to go.

09:08.226 --> 09:10.758
Man, what the hell are you doing?

09:10.844 --> 09:13.781
- Look, I-I got a license!
- Yeah.

09:13.892 --> 09:15.892
And unless you shut up,

09:16.083 --> 09:17.883
you're also gonna get a fat lip.

09:19.620 --> 09:21.553
(chatter stops)

09:23.649 --> 09:25.188
We got a problem?

09:29.506 --> 09:32.186
BULLOCK: Penguin guarantees
these numbers?

09:32.215 --> 09:34.448
PENN: Mr. Cobblepot has negotiated them

09:34.491 --> 09:36.124
with the mayor and commissioner.

09:36.159 --> 09:37.742
These are damn good numbers.

09:37.781 --> 09:39.047
But I already heard
from the commissioner.

09:39.072 --> 09:40.938
We have to play ball. What the
hell are you doing here?

09:40.982 --> 09:44.550
Compliance with the licenses is key.

09:44.577 --> 09:47.945
Mr. Cobblepot worries
about Detective Gordon.

09:47.981 --> 09:49.539
He has a history.

09:49.564 --> 09:53.611
My men will honor the licenses.
You let me worry about Gordon.

09:53.648 --> 09:55.790
Now, get the hell out of my office.

09:59.859 --> 10:00.925
Hmm.

10:03.506 --> 10:06.197
- Who was that?
- A, uh, dung beetle.

10:07.425 --> 10:08.658
What's up?

10:08.701 --> 10:11.969
I pulled this off of some guy

10:12.005 --> 10:13.604
robbing my corner bar.

10:13.639 --> 10:15.306
You're a homicide detective.

10:15.341 --> 10:18.205
Isn't, uh, a stickup a little JV?

10:18.275 --> 10:20.765
I'm a cop. I see a crime, I stop it.

10:20.804 --> 10:22.748
This is the second one of
these I've come across,

10:22.773 --> 10:24.315
- and I'm not the only one.
- Yeah.

10:25.785 --> 10:27.398
Harvey.

10:27.787 --> 10:29.587
Harvey, we cannot let this slide.

10:30.630 --> 10:33.052
Word's come down from the commissioner,

10:33.974 --> 10:36.763
you find someone with
one of those, they walk.

10:36.817 --> 10:38.402
(scoffs) And before you
get on your high horse,

10:38.427 --> 10:41.021
three months ago,
this city was in a tailspin.

10:41.052 --> 10:44.286
We survived because Penguin
took control of the underworld.

10:44.333 --> 10:46.005
I am not giving the city
over to Penguin.

10:46.052 --> 10:48.380
- I don't care what the commissioner says.
- What about your fellow cops, huh?

10:48.427 --> 10:50.460
The past month,
how many have been shot? None.

10:50.485 --> 10:51.804
I know the stats.

10:51.829 --> 10:54.468
Jim, we will bust Penguin
one day, I promise you.

10:54.493 --> 10:56.542
But this city has to get
back on her feet.

10:56.577 --> 10:58.045
Please?

10:58.070 --> 10:59.671
Harvey, I get that.

11:00.031 --> 11:02.490
But every day the citizens
of Gotham look to Penguin

11:02.515 --> 11:04.803
and not the GCPD to keep them safe,

11:04.838 --> 11:06.165
the harder it's gonna be
to win them back.

11:06.191 --> 11:07.941
You want people to trust cops,

11:08.442 --> 11:09.966
there are better ways of doing it

11:10.075 --> 11:12.567
than spitting in Penguin's eyes.

11:12.645 --> 11:14.003
You see one of these,

11:14.491 --> 11:16.324
you walk.

11:30.755 --> 11:32.155
ALFRED: Bloody Penguin.

11:32.190 --> 11:34.490
There must be some way we
can turn this against him.

11:34.526 --> 11:36.626
Oh, just-just stop.

11:36.661 --> 11:37.994
Stop right there.

11:38.029 --> 11:40.685
How does this fit in
to what we're doing?

11:41.833 --> 11:44.367
What was the initial reason
that you popped on that mask

11:44.402 --> 11:45.602
and you went out there?

11:45.637 --> 11:47.337
We agreed that I have to be ready

11:47.372 --> 11:49.105
for when Ra's al Ghul returns.

11:49.621 --> 11:52.041
You yourself said there's no substitute
for real-world encounters.

11:52.077 --> 11:54.043
But my point is if that is our mission,

11:54.079 --> 11:56.051
we must hold to it.

11:57.583 --> 12:00.947
My finger was on the button
that released the virus.

12:01.553 --> 12:03.519
- Oh, I see.
- I know I didn't press it,

12:03.555 --> 12:05.622
but I feel responsible
for what happened.

12:06.292 --> 12:09.692
And more than that, I can make a difference
in Gotham, Alfred. I know I can.

12:09.728 --> 12:13.407
And that is what we call
"mission creep," Master Bruce.

12:14.157 --> 12:17.375
You're trying to achieve
not one but two objectives.

12:17.769 --> 12:19.250
So, go on, then.

12:19.471 --> 12:21.383
Which one is your priority?

12:24.142 --> 12:26.586
It's messy, sir.

12:27.354 --> 12:28.915
It's dangerous.

12:29.728 --> 12:31.970
I hear you, Alfred.

12:32.817 --> 12:35.051
But I can prepare myself for Ra's

12:35.086 --> 12:36.963
and make Gotham safer.

12:39.057 --> 12:41.291
You have to trust me.

12:45.697 --> 12:49.032
(door opens, closes)

12:49.067 --> 12:52.135
MAN (over P.A.): <i>All inmates,
last call... in five minutes,</i>

12:52.190 --> 12:55.204
<i>make your way to the door
and the nearest...</i>

12:55.240 --> 12:57.240
(quiet chatter)

13:00.390 --> 13:02.157
This way.

13:02.380 --> 13:03.880
Hey, Warden Reed.

13:05.183 --> 13:07.216
Warden Reed's the boss here.

13:07.252 --> 13:09.519
(inmates murmuring)

13:11.716 --> 13:14.150
(humming off-key)

13:16.528 --> 13:17.927
(inmate whistling)

13:18.963 --> 13:20.363
(screams, laughs)

13:20.398 --> 13:22.265
(shouting maniacally)

13:26.781 --> 13:28.247
Where is he?

13:28.306 --> 13:30.166
This way.

13:30.508 --> 13:33.409
(man grunting quietly)

13:34.487 --> 13:36.479
Back when I was an orderly in here,

13:36.713 --> 13:39.849
he'd always talk about his dad
and this formula he'd made.

13:39.884 --> 13:41.851
Some sort of scare juice.

13:42.002 --> 13:43.856
Make you see your greatest fear.

13:44.022 --> 13:45.372
We get ahold of that,

13:45.490 --> 13:48.442
we don't got to worry
about Zsasz or Penguin,

13:48.660 --> 13:50.692
or nobody.

13:51.529 --> 13:52.929
What's wrong with him, anyway?

13:52.998 --> 13:56.165
The toxin his father injected him with

13:56.498 --> 13:59.135
overloaded Jonathan's fear response.

13:59.170 --> 14:02.939
His mind created
a sort of boogieman figure.

14:02.974 --> 14:05.657
Now it haunts him.

14:06.077 --> 14:08.782
I find it very useful for...

14:09.347 --> 14:11.484
controlling him.

14:16.289 --> 14:18.955
Jonathan, you're going with these men.

14:20.421 --> 14:22.178
What? Wait. Where are you taking me?

14:22.203 --> 14:23.960
We just want to give
someone a little scare.

14:23.995 --> 14:25.395
Excellent.

14:29.701 --> 14:31.701
♪ ♪

14:39.213 --> 14:41.213
(bird squawking)

14:54.192 --> 14:55.625
(panting): Yeah.

14:55.654 --> 14:57.186
That's all, that's all my dad's stuff.

14:57.221 --> 14:59.174
Look, I can't be here
after dark, please.

14:59.199 --> 15:01.386
I real... I cannot be here after...

15:02.150 --> 15:04.817
You were your daddy's
little assistant, weren't you?

15:05.135 --> 15:06.619
You helped with the experiments.

15:06.654 --> 15:08.454
Some, but I don't know everything!

15:08.490 --> 15:10.523
Now, you're gonna take
your daddy's notebooks

15:10.558 --> 15:13.126
and make as much of
that fear juice as I say.

15:13.161 --> 15:14.894
And so you don't get lonely,

15:14.929 --> 15:17.096
the boys here brought you a friend.

15:17.132 --> 15:18.264
CRANE: No.

15:18.299 --> 15:20.833
No! (screams)

15:20.869 --> 15:22.602
No, don't! Please, stop!

15:22.637 --> 15:23.770
(laughing)

15:23.805 --> 15:25.238
No, you don't understand!

15:35.383 --> 15:38.064
MERTON: Good morning,
ladies and gentlemen.

15:38.157 --> 15:40.517
May I have your attention, please!

15:40.555 --> 15:43.389
(people screaming)

15:43.642 --> 15:45.496
All the money, now!

15:46.118 --> 15:48.152
Give it to me! All of it!

15:48.196 --> 15:50.872
MAN: Hey. You have a license?

15:51.599 --> 15:52.665
(screams)

15:55.746 --> 15:57.982
Look at me.

15:58.021 --> 15:59.338
(screaming)

15:59.374 --> 16:01.908
(roaring, laughing)

16:05.013 --> 16:06.979
(siren wails outside)

16:07.015 --> 16:08.314
(indistinct police radio chatter)

16:08.349 --> 16:10.855
MAN (quietly): Fiery demons. Demons.

16:10.880 --> 16:12.279
Fiery demons.

16:12.304 --> 16:13.615
- Demons.
- Demons. Yeah, yeah.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.045
Yeah, we'll catch them.
Get him out of here.

16:15.070 --> 16:17.070
- Go, go, go, go.
- (sobs): Fiery demons.

16:19.127 --> 16:21.020
Hey.

16:21.129 --> 16:23.095
Did Penguin issue a license for this?

16:23.131 --> 16:24.840
Why you asking me?

16:25.723 --> 16:27.266
Best of my knowledge, no.

16:28.270 --> 16:30.043
Then why do something so public?

16:30.121 --> 16:31.838
Unless you're trying
to send Penguin a message.

16:31.897 --> 16:34.499
I hope the message was "Please
send Victor Zsasz down here

16:34.561 --> 16:36.708
to kill me," because that's
exactly what's gonna happen.

16:36.733 --> 16:38.755
- Not if I find them first.
- Hey!

16:38.780 --> 16:40.980
You asked me to stop busting
crooks with licenses.

16:41.459 --> 16:43.326
This gang didn't have a license.

16:43.351 --> 16:44.851
And you're gonna find them before Zsasz

16:44.886 --> 16:47.203
just to prove that GCPD still matters?

16:47.304 --> 16:48.904
That's not thumbing
your nose at Penguin?

16:48.929 --> 16:51.653
- Fire me.
- Hey, don't tempt me.

16:53.561 --> 16:55.061
You got a lead?

16:56.397 --> 16:58.323
The victims, the way they're acting,

16:58.399 --> 17:02.019
their terror reminds me
of Crane's formula.

17:02.355 --> 17:04.270
You think someone's using
the fear juice?

17:04.455 --> 17:06.439
It ain't him. He's dead, remember?

17:06.473 --> 17:09.032
Not that that matters much
in this town anymore.

17:09.244 --> 17:11.779
He's dead. His son isn't.

17:14.348 --> 17:17.584
REED: Jonathan Crane's condition
is fragile.

17:17.608 --> 17:19.785
- I'm afraid he can't see anyone.
- (inmates murmuring)

17:19.810 --> 17:23.377
Certainly not the two men
who killed his father.

17:23.592 --> 17:26.759
Yeah, so, uh, how many loonies
you got in this joint?

17:26.794 --> 17:28.661
REED: 436 total.

17:28.696 --> 17:30.563
We mustn't call them "loonies."

17:30.598 --> 17:32.532
- Course not.
- (door buzzes)

17:34.302 --> 17:37.349
How about staff
that had access to Crane?

17:37.472 --> 17:39.572
Any of them not show up for work?

17:39.607 --> 17:42.522
All present and accounted for.

17:42.615 --> 17:43.943
You don't want to check?

17:43.978 --> 17:46.272
- I don't need to.
- See, that's impressive.

17:46.381 --> 17:48.177
'Cause I run a precinct,
and if half my cops

17:48.202 --> 17:51.295
- didn't show up, I'd be none the wiser.
- It's true. He wouldn't.

17:51.358 --> 17:55.037
Clearly we have different...
professional standards.

17:56.190 --> 17:58.257
(exhales softly)

17:58.293 --> 18:00.214
Jonathan Crane's father

18:00.260 --> 18:04.113
created a toxin that makes people
see their greatest fear.

18:04.632 --> 18:06.933
This morning, it was used to rob a bank.

18:07.066 --> 18:08.434
How is that my problem?

18:08.469 --> 18:10.002
Let me explain it to you.

18:10.764 --> 18:13.039
See, whoever robbed the bank,

18:13.768 --> 18:15.167
they challenged Penguin.

18:15.476 --> 18:17.143
And all we have to do

18:17.178 --> 18:19.522
is tell Penguin that you're involved,

18:19.592 --> 18:22.381
and he'll send Victor Zsasz
down here to talk to you.

18:22.417 --> 18:23.950
Jim, how would you describe Victor?

18:23.985 --> 18:26.489
Victor Zsasz?

18:26.821 --> 18:28.582
A homicidal maniac and sadist.

18:28.762 --> 18:30.556
A homicidal maniac and sadist

18:30.592 --> 18:33.996
of the highest professional standards.

18:34.395 --> 18:36.794
So you can talk with us here and now,

18:37.065 --> 18:39.065
or you can talk to Victor.

18:41.369 --> 18:43.769
They threatened me; I had no choice.

18:44.020 --> 18:46.372
We want a name, putz.

18:50.024 --> 18:52.979
BULLOCK: I knew it rang a bell.
Grady Harris.

18:53.014 --> 18:55.047
Ran a crew a few years back.

18:55.083 --> 18:56.549
Him and his cousin Merton.

18:56.574 --> 18:58.574
Couple of cowboys from the sticks.

19:03.091 --> 19:04.597
Grady!

19:05.626 --> 19:06.858
GCPD!

19:13.553 --> 19:15.152
GCPD!

19:17.472 --> 19:18.604
(Bullock groans)

19:18.640 --> 19:20.992
- (grunts)
- Well, well.

19:21.062 --> 19:23.382
Look at what we got here.

19:29.343 --> 19:32.545
What's wrong with you pigs?
Harassing honest fellas like us,

19:32.639 --> 19:34.546
when there's real criminals out there.

19:34.581 --> 19:36.609
You robbed a bank in broad daylight.

19:36.680 --> 19:39.150
- That don't make you a criminal?
- I'm an outlaw!

19:39.186 --> 19:41.353
Outlaws have a code.

19:41.388 --> 19:42.343
(grunts)

19:42.368 --> 19:43.367
- (chuckles)
- Criminals,

19:43.392 --> 19:44.546
they'll take everything.

19:44.591 --> 19:45.957
They'll take a man's livelihood.

19:45.993 --> 19:47.459
Like the Penguin.

19:47.494 --> 19:49.071
And his licenses.

19:49.136 --> 19:52.133
But we're gonna show him, you'll see.

19:52.180 --> 19:53.064
(grunts)

19:53.100 --> 19:55.166
Penguin wouldn't give you a license

19:55.202 --> 19:58.570
if you begged him till the cows
came home, you stupid hick!

19:58.605 --> 20:01.006
(chuckles) You're lucky
I'm not the Penguin.

20:01.118 --> 20:03.183
We would gut you right here.

20:03.238 --> 20:05.074
We're better than them!

20:05.175 --> 20:07.679
Take care, pigs.

20:07.714 --> 20:09.214
(chuckles)

20:11.385 --> 20:12.551
(lock clicks, doorknob rattles)

20:12.586 --> 20:14.019
(man laughs)

20:14.054 --> 20:16.054
(dogs barking in distance)

20:19.259 --> 20:20.458
(men chattering)

20:20.494 --> 20:23.362
- They see him anyway.
- Hey, check it out.

20:26.533 --> 20:28.333
(men murmuring)

20:28.368 --> 20:30.218
(laughs): Ooh.

20:30.243 --> 20:32.337
- Looking for company?
- (men murmuring)

20:34.398 --> 20:36.689
She all by herself.

20:43.664 --> 20:45.307
Just let me go, okay?

20:45.335 --> 20:46.820
Not a chance.

20:49.114 --> 20:51.077
Don't say I didn't warn you.

20:51.224 --> 20:53.158
(whip cracks, men grunting)

21:08.175 --> 21:10.141
(grunting)

21:11.912 --> 21:13.878
(panting)

21:14.281 --> 21:17.500
Don't turn your back on a guy
unless you're sure he's down.

21:19.250 --> 21:21.019
Otherwise, not bad.

21:21.563 --> 21:23.555
Does this mean we can get pizza?

21:26.793 --> 21:28.994
(panting)

21:34.054 --> 21:36.134
I'm just saying,
you steal my pepperoni again,

21:36.169 --> 21:37.304
I'll break your fingers.

21:37.329 --> 21:40.739
So you're saying do
steal your pepperoni again?

21:43.143 --> 21:45.100
I come in peace.

21:46.335 --> 21:49.280
You ladies were not easy to track down.

21:50.100 --> 21:53.999
Then again, I can see
why you don't advertise.

21:55.209 --> 21:56.975
Didn't you used to be rich?

21:57.046 --> 21:58.790
That was before your boss stole my club.

21:59.030 --> 22:02.260
Well, you murdered his mom

22:02.737 --> 22:04.338
and tried to kill him.

22:04.690 --> 22:07.315
So... call it even?

22:07.434 --> 22:08.967
There a reason you're here?

22:12.729 --> 22:14.204
You know about these?

22:16.610 --> 22:19.181
The boss can't have you
operating on your own.

22:19.846 --> 22:22.603
Now, he could just kill you,

22:22.783 --> 22:26.660
but he figures it's time
to let bygones be bygones.

22:26.715 --> 22:28.615
How big of him.

22:29.801 --> 22:31.784
Tomorrow night's
the opening of his club.

22:32.035 --> 22:35.088
Come by, kiss the ring,

22:35.573 --> 22:37.409
get your license.

22:38.059 --> 22:39.492
Is that pepperoni?

22:44.899 --> 22:48.254
Goes without saying,
this is one of those...

22:48.570 --> 22:50.837
"or else" kind of deals.

22:54.309 --> 22:56.078
Later.

22:56.334 --> 22:58.554
We got to find a new place.

22:58.719 --> 23:01.381
Why? We join Penguin,
we can at least get work.

23:02.047 --> 23:04.422
I came to you because
I wanted to move up.

23:04.508 --> 23:06.486
And look around.

23:06.896 --> 23:08.889
We're barely making it.

23:10.025 --> 23:11.491
I'm not working for him.

23:11.608 --> 23:13.226
Now, pack.

23:24.497 --> 23:25.894
BRUCE: Detective Gordon.

23:27.647 --> 23:28.775
Bruce.

23:30.891 --> 23:32.691
I didn't hear you.

23:32.727 --> 23:34.026
What happened?

23:35.007 --> 23:36.704
Uh, nothing.

23:36.805 --> 23:38.563
Harvey and I were tracking a gang.

23:38.602 --> 23:40.032
We let ourselves get surprised.

23:40.078 --> 23:41.377
What brings you down here?

23:41.402 --> 23:43.477
I found this when I was in the city.

23:43.871 --> 23:45.738
Wasn't sure what to do with it.

23:45.937 --> 23:47.646
One of Penguin's licenses.

23:47.885 --> 23:49.401
Apparently, crime is legal now.

23:49.440 --> 23:50.909
And you're going along with that?

23:50.945 --> 23:52.711
Not really.

23:54.348 --> 23:56.515
There's a number on the license.

23:57.128 --> 24:00.018
I was thinking Penguin must have
some sort of master list.

24:00.438 --> 24:02.955
Connecting the crime and the
criminal to the license issued.

24:02.990 --> 24:04.256
List like that would tell you

24:04.281 --> 24:05.977
not only who committed that crime,

24:06.767 --> 24:08.727
but crimes that haven't
even happened yet.

24:10.238 --> 24:13.225
Unfortunately, the judges are
going along with the licenses.

24:13.250 --> 24:14.399
I'm trying to track down

24:14.435 --> 24:16.668
who in Penguin's organization
keeps the list.

24:16.868 --> 24:18.804
It would set off too many alarms.

24:20.474 --> 24:22.098
I see.

24:24.979 --> 24:27.145
But you haven't given up.

24:28.082 --> 24:29.782
You just said
you were out tracking a gang.

24:29.817 --> 24:31.049
That's different.

24:31.085 --> 24:32.987
This gang isn't licensed.

24:33.350 --> 24:34.583
But...

24:35.018 --> 24:37.237
Penguin will come after them,
if he hasn't already.

24:37.300 --> 24:38.893
And when he catches them,

24:39.011 --> 24:41.660
it'll be more proof that Gotham
doesn't need the GCPD.

24:43.130 --> 24:45.130
Sorry, it's been a long day.

24:47.268 --> 24:49.468
So why not use Penguin
to lead you to them?

24:49.503 --> 24:52.766
If I could figure out
how to do that, I would.

24:54.698 --> 24:56.298
It was good to see you, Detective.

24:56.500 --> 24:58.610
You should come by the house for dinner.

24:59.125 --> 25:00.766
Yes.

25:01.953 --> 25:03.186
I'd like that.

25:03.651 --> 25:06.327
How about we grab a bite...

25:08.833 --> 25:09.991
...tonight?

25:12.793 --> 25:15.093
Exclusive, but welcoming.

25:15.129 --> 25:17.563
Urbane and edgy.

25:17.589 --> 25:20.957
Tonight's opening will establish
the Iceberg Lounge

25:21.001 --> 25:24.892
as Gotham's newest place to see
and be seen.

25:24.923 --> 25:26.738
And you say you acquired
the club from Barbara Kean?

25:26.774 --> 25:28.407
Is that a question?

25:28.720 --> 25:30.653
It's just, no one's
seen her for months, and...

25:30.678 --> 25:32.177
Well, Barbara Kean's whereabouts

25:32.213 --> 25:34.012
are not my concern.

25:34.048 --> 25:37.183
This was The Sirens club.
It is now mine.

25:37.208 --> 25:38.558
MAN: Mr. Cobblepot,

25:38.583 --> 25:40.129
there's a rumor going around
about criminals

25:40.154 --> 25:41.530
being given licenses.

25:41.555 --> 25:43.021
The rumor is you're issuing them.

25:43.057 --> 25:45.825
Tell me, what is
the crime rate in Gotham?

25:45.850 --> 25:49.749
- We're at historic lows.
- Historic lows.

25:50.631 --> 25:53.999
You know, Augustus Caesar once presided

25:54.034 --> 25:57.202
over the longest period
of peace and prosperity

25:57.238 --> 25:58.826
the world has ever known.

25:59.309 --> 26:01.810
It was called the Pax Romana.

26:02.009 --> 26:03.942
Perhaps one day, this will be known as

26:03.978 --> 26:06.011
the "Pax Penguina." (chuckles)

26:06.295 --> 26:08.543
That's not a denial.

26:08.723 --> 26:10.883
We're here to talk about my club.

26:10.918 --> 26:12.117
(gasps)

26:12.152 --> 26:14.086
Your readers will
find this interesting. Ivy?

26:14.121 --> 26:15.187
(remote beeps)

26:15.222 --> 26:16.622
(cameras clicking)

26:18.525 --> 26:20.973
That's Edward Nygma.

26:21.715 --> 26:24.296
Turns out Ed had
a very rare brain disease.

26:24.497 --> 26:25.731
There was only one option:

26:25.848 --> 26:28.200
to freeze him and wait for the cure.

26:29.570 --> 26:32.056
In his final lucid moments,

26:32.373 --> 26:36.907
he begged me,
"Oswald, do not hide me away.

26:36.985 --> 26:38.944
Put me out with the people."

26:40.915 --> 26:42.685
It was the least I could do.

26:42.829 --> 26:45.622
Anyone tell him he was being frozen?

26:46.320 --> 26:47.918
I have affidavits from his doctor,

26:47.979 --> 26:50.499
- if you would like to see them.
- No, thanks.

26:56.697 --> 26:57.996
Well, Jim,

26:58.032 --> 26:59.197
I'm rather busy.

26:59.233 --> 27:00.766
So whatever your business is...

27:00.801 --> 27:02.768
I came to tell you you're a fraud.

27:02.803 --> 27:06.084
The gang that has Crane's fear toxin,

27:06.149 --> 27:07.682
they're not afraid of you.

27:07.865 --> 27:10.342
Others will find out. That's how it begins.

27:11.435 --> 27:13.679
(quietly):
You've had a nice run, Oswald,

27:14.119 --> 27:15.851
but it's over.

27:16.226 --> 27:17.929
Oh, Jim,

27:18.006 --> 27:20.925
it's so hard to admit when
you've become irrelevant.

27:22.957 --> 27:25.090
Let me tell you what's gonna happen.

27:25.132 --> 27:26.799
I'm going to find this gang,

27:26.827 --> 27:29.027
and I'm going to crush them.

27:29.063 --> 27:32.364
And everyone will see
that it is Oswald Cobblepot,

27:32.710 --> 27:36.397
the Penguin, who keeps Gotham safe.

27:38.201 --> 27:40.401
Always good to see you, old friend!

27:40.641 --> 27:44.042
<i>As he prepares for the opening
of the Iceberg Lounge,</i>

27:44.078 --> 27:47.631
<i>Oswald Cobblepot announced
that he would destroy the gang</i>

27:47.656 --> 27:51.416
<i>that attacked Gotham
First National Bank yesterday.</i>

27:51.452 --> 27:54.119
<i>He described them as cowards
and pond scum.</i>

27:54.154 --> 27:55.733
(sighs)

27:56.357 --> 27:59.147
Penguin's going down tonight.

28:02.596 --> 28:05.341
- You finish that new batch yet?
- Yes.

28:05.366 --> 28:08.233
Now, can you please, can you please
get rid of that, please?

28:08.354 --> 28:10.767
(chuckles) What, you and him
ain't getting along?

28:10.792 --> 28:12.237
Please, just get rid of it!

28:12.579 --> 28:15.540
Listen, I got to do some things tonight,

28:15.743 --> 28:17.876
but I think you guys should
spend some time together,

28:17.911 --> 28:19.293
- huh?
- No, please.

28:19.318 --> 28:21.546
We all have our fears to face.

28:22.349 --> 28:24.483
Stop, stop! Please!

28:24.540 --> 28:26.018
Stop, please!

28:26.094 --> 28:27.652
No!

28:27.688 --> 28:28.653
Stop!

28:28.689 --> 28:30.950
(banging on door)

28:30.975 --> 28:33.109
Let me out!

28:37.049 --> 28:39.950
Remember how you accused me
of being slave to my emotions?

28:40.401 --> 28:41.934
No more.

28:42.479 --> 28:44.486
I have banished those feelings.

28:45.135 --> 28:46.831
And look how I have risen.

28:49.386 --> 28:51.019
But at what cost?

28:51.905 --> 28:53.816
I wonder which of us is frozen.

28:54.806 --> 28:56.166
Him.

28:56.476 --> 28:59.377
He's, like, totally frozen.

28:59.607 --> 29:02.910
Ivy, go somewhere else.

29:13.398 --> 29:15.685
All right, I want two
unmarked units at street level,

29:15.710 --> 29:16.937
and another two teams with me and Harvey

29:17.000 --> 29:18.433
watching the entrances to the club.

29:18.461 --> 29:21.450
The moment that gang arrives, we move.

29:23.533 --> 29:25.299
You heard the man.

29:25.335 --> 29:27.468
Suit up! Let's go!

29:31.394 --> 29:32.760
Can we count on them?

29:32.795 --> 29:35.080
Let's see, you tricked Penguin
into baiting the gang

29:35.105 --> 29:37.222
to attack his club,
hoping to arrest them

29:37.261 --> 29:39.915
before they cause mass panic,
only so you could

29:39.940 --> 29:41.571
embarrass Penguin, so I would say yeah,

29:41.596 --> 29:43.070
they're about as dependable
as any other part

29:43.106 --> 29:44.772
- of this cockamamie plan.
- Thanks.

29:44.807 --> 29:46.807
I'll get the gas masks.

29:49.412 --> 29:51.412
♪ ♪

29:58.632 --> 30:00.832
(doorknob rattles)

30:00.857 --> 30:02.923
Please, let me out!

30:04.861 --> 30:06.403
SCARECROW: <i>Jonathan.</i>

30:13.836 --> 30:15.963
Let me out!

30:16.372 --> 30:18.272
<i>Jonathan!</i>

30:18.307 --> 30:19.673
(roaring)

30:33.005 --> 30:35.602
- So you guys work for Penguin, huh?
- It ain't like that.

30:35.637 --> 30:37.925
- Sure.
- Come on, Gordon.

30:37.950 --> 30:40.273
Since Penguin's been cracking down,
life's been good.

30:40.309 --> 30:42.008
Why you got to rock the boat?

30:42.044 --> 30:43.744
(door closes)

30:43.779 --> 30:47.214
What happens when he starts
giving out licenses for murders?

30:47.449 --> 30:48.482
Huh?

30:48.517 --> 30:50.315
What then?

30:50.586 --> 30:51.918
I'm wasting my breath, aren't I?

30:51.954 --> 30:53.487
Pretty much.

30:55.524 --> 30:57.814
All right, then.

30:58.681 --> 31:00.014
Who wants it first?

31:07.803 --> 31:10.837
(dance music playing)

31:10.873 --> 31:12.873
(lively chatter, laughter)

31:15.110 --> 31:17.948
Mr. Wayne, Mr. Pennyworth.

31:18.026 --> 31:19.579
I am so glad you could make it.

31:19.615 --> 31:21.348
It's our pleasure.

31:21.383 --> 31:23.116
- Congratulations.
- (chuckles)

31:23.152 --> 31:25.886
We were just admiring your frozen mate.

31:26.989 --> 31:28.755
Is he still alive in there?

31:28.827 --> 31:30.824
I fear we may never know.

31:31.069 --> 31:33.360
Well, you'll know when
you finally thaw him out.

31:33.519 --> 31:35.829
When they discover
a cure for his disease.

31:35.864 --> 31:38.932
Oh, yes. Then, of course.

31:39.161 --> 31:40.355
I wanted to personally thank you

31:40.380 --> 31:42.370
for everything
you've done for this city.

31:42.471 --> 31:44.137
Thank you, Mr. Wayne.

31:45.174 --> 31:46.681
So...

31:47.236 --> 31:49.176
can I ask about the licenses?

31:49.337 --> 31:51.778
Uh, a little discretion,
if you would, Master Bruce.

31:51.814 --> 31:53.313
Everybody's talking about it, Alfred.

31:53.348 --> 31:55.090
I just want to know how it works.

31:55.816 --> 31:57.818
So, does someone come to you and say

31:58.230 --> 31:59.627
"I want to rob a bank"?

31:59.655 --> 32:01.113
(laughs)

32:01.137 --> 32:03.588
Now, Bruce, if I didn't know any better,

32:03.613 --> 32:05.931
I would think that you wanted me
to implicate myself.

32:05.956 --> 32:08.003
Anything you say stays between us.

32:09.651 --> 32:11.456
First, let me ask...

32:11.737 --> 32:15.235
you would be agreeable
to the idea of licensed crime?

32:15.800 --> 32:17.928
If crime had been licensed
and controlled three years ago,

32:17.953 --> 32:19.739
my parents would still be alive.

32:20.735 --> 32:23.063
Exactly so.

32:24.008 --> 32:26.269
Well, between us,

32:26.566 --> 32:28.815
I have nothing to do with
the licenses directly.

32:28.972 --> 32:32.185
I provide the guidelines while Mr. Penn

32:32.495 --> 32:34.777
handles all of the details.

32:36.794 --> 32:39.458
Now... would you excuse me?

32:43.765 --> 32:45.932
- Well done, sir.
- Thank you.

32:46.527 --> 32:48.201
Now we know who has the list.

32:48.581 --> 32:50.604
The next step is...

32:51.607 --> 32:53.240
Selina.

33:02.142 --> 33:04.150
Where's your babysitter?

33:05.120 --> 33:08.902
- It's kind of a package deal.
- Yeah. Well, he's got me.

33:09.706 --> 33:11.416
Is that good enough or not?

33:11.534 --> 33:12.633
TABITHA: Actually,

33:13.808 --> 33:15.282
we're both in.

33:18.158 --> 33:19.399
I should...

33:19.547 --> 33:21.434
- pat you down for weapons.
- Sure.

33:21.618 --> 33:23.648
If you want to lose a hand.

33:23.937 --> 33:25.381
It was worth a shot.

33:25.941 --> 33:27.941
I'll tell the boss.

33:29.416 --> 33:30.792
See ya.

33:36.652 --> 33:39.031
You were worried about me.

33:46.361 --> 33:47.794
(door opens)

33:47.829 --> 33:50.272
Hey, man, I been looking
all over for you.

33:50.858 --> 33:52.465
Ooh, ouch.

33:52.757 --> 33:55.001
Think we can forget about backup.

33:55.194 --> 33:57.737
I see you talked to some
of your fellow officers.

33:57.773 --> 34:00.240
- Probably not a bad thing.
- How's that?

34:00.285 --> 34:03.609
Guys get to let off steam,
resentments don't fester.

34:03.648 --> 34:05.896
Next time, you can
get punched in the face.

34:05.921 --> 34:08.010
This beautiful mug? No one would dare.

34:08.034 --> 34:09.543
Let's go.

34:12.955 --> 34:14.321
(dance music playing)

34:16.215 --> 34:20.192
All right, once inside,
gas Zsasz and Penguin first,

34:20.246 --> 34:21.460
and then go crazy.

34:21.496 --> 34:23.330
I still don't see Penguin.

34:23.364 --> 34:25.329
OSWALD: Hello!

34:25.665 --> 34:28.601
I'm guessing that gas
isn't faster than a bullet.

34:28.627 --> 34:30.060
What do you think?

34:32.274 --> 34:35.208
Jim Gordon and his
ham-fisted manipulation.

34:35.496 --> 34:37.210
He thought he fooled me.

34:37.464 --> 34:39.679
ZSASZ: You want to
do 'em here or downstairs?

34:39.715 --> 34:41.915
- Might be a little loud in here.
- Neither.

34:44.072 --> 34:46.657
I have something special
planned for them.

35:02.451 --> 35:04.218
What do you want, Bruce?

35:06.222 --> 35:07.688
You knew I'd follow you.

35:08.128 --> 35:09.849
Just like I knew you'd come up here.

35:10.574 --> 35:12.726
You don't know anything about me.

35:16.128 --> 35:18.265
I wanted to apologize
for what I said at the hospital

35:18.300 --> 35:19.945
when you came to visit Alfred.

35:20.536 --> 35:22.508
You were making a kind gesture.

35:26.959 --> 35:29.224
You want to talk to me, come up here.

35:41.449 --> 35:43.679
My point is I'm sorry.

35:45.960 --> 35:47.195
Yeah.

35:48.273 --> 35:49.696
You were a jerk.

35:53.817 --> 35:56.652
I saw you arrive with Tabitha Galavan.

35:58.140 --> 35:59.984
I'm not sure I'd choose her as a mentor.

36:00.075 --> 36:01.398
Wow.

36:03.045 --> 36:05.379
That means absolutely nothing to me.

36:12.577 --> 36:13.710
Selina...

36:14.745 --> 36:16.078
Oh?

36:17.817 --> 36:20.284
You... you want to say something?

36:24.395 --> 36:26.418
That's a lovely dress
you're wearing tonight.

36:28.861 --> 36:30.696
Honestly, you two.

36:30.806 --> 36:33.642
Why can't you just go to the
cinema like normal teenagers?

36:33.880 --> 36:35.579
Uh, Master Bruce, we got a bit of a...

36:35.678 --> 36:37.845
bit of a situation downstairs.

36:39.144 --> 36:40.610
What sort of situation?

36:42.537 --> 36:44.207
Miss Kyle.

36:49.692 --> 36:52.760
OSWALD: For the past three
months, I have given this city

36:52.823 --> 36:54.495
a tranquility it has never known.

36:54.776 --> 36:58.198
Now I would like to ensure
that peace for the future.

36:59.034 --> 37:00.567
In the weeks to come,

37:00.603 --> 37:02.135
you will hear whispers

37:02.171 --> 37:04.379
about what's happening
in the streets of Gotham.

37:04.440 --> 37:07.980
All you need to know is without me...

37:08.301 --> 37:10.235
this is what you get.

37:10.279 --> 37:14.058
Men who want to bring fear
back to our city,

37:14.242 --> 37:17.128
who promise a return to the old days.

37:17.253 --> 37:20.175
So... tell your families,

37:20.261 --> 37:21.755
tell your friends,

37:21.848 --> 37:26.059
it is Oswald Cobblepot
who keeps them safe,

37:26.212 --> 37:28.812
not the GCPD.

37:31.585 --> 37:33.985
You're welcome!

37:38.419 --> 37:40.607
I have my things in the car.
We can stop them in the parking garage.

37:40.643 --> 37:42.276
Absolutely not, Master Bruce.

37:42.394 --> 37:44.645
Alfred, Penguin is gonna take
those men out and kill them.

37:44.737 --> 37:46.394
Undoubtedly so...

37:46.502 --> 37:48.963
but as you said before,
you can make a difference.

37:49.292 --> 37:51.087
There is a time for masks,

37:51.150 --> 37:53.220
and there is a time for Bruce Wayne.

37:54.096 --> 37:55.933
OSWALD: What's going
to be done to you...

37:55.967 --> 37:57.267
BRUCE: Wait!

37:58.360 --> 38:00.561
I want to know what you're
going to do with those men.

38:00.596 --> 38:03.263
You need not concern yourself with that.

38:03.299 --> 38:04.898
Are those men going to be
turned over to the police?

38:04.934 --> 38:06.934
(chuckles)

38:11.373 --> 38:14.515
Earlier tonight, you thanked me
for making the city safer.

38:14.754 --> 38:16.999
Now, how do you think that happened?

38:17.313 --> 38:20.648
I do the dirty work no one else will.

38:21.585 --> 38:23.050
I understand.

38:23.803 --> 38:25.151
But I'm asking you,

38:25.221 --> 38:26.886
turn those men over to the police.

38:28.057 --> 38:29.683
You're young.

38:31.727 --> 38:33.427
You have a good heart.

38:37.506 --> 38:39.439
No.

38:42.638 --> 38:44.905
Enjoy your party, Penguin.

38:45.073 --> 38:46.707
You little twerp.

38:46.742 --> 38:48.342
(people gasping)

38:50.512 --> 38:52.379
(men grunting, guns cocking)

39:01.624 --> 39:02.956
(screams)

39:06.428 --> 39:08.428
(gasping)

39:10.699 --> 39:12.366
(distorted): What's wrong?

39:12.401 --> 39:14.034
- (gasps)
- You scared?!

39:14.069 --> 39:15.502
(screaming)

39:15.537 --> 39:17.704
(distorted laughing)

39:24.813 --> 39:26.313
(Oswald screaming)

39:26.348 --> 39:27.681
(laughing)

39:28.552 --> 39:29.985
GORDON: Hey!

39:31.828 --> 39:33.787
- (Oswald gasping)
- You're under arrest,

39:33.822 --> 39:37.124
by order of the Gotham City
Police Department. Cuff him.

39:37.159 --> 39:38.392
(Oswald gasps)

39:41.397 --> 39:43.964
(gasping)

39:43.989 --> 39:45.781
Help me!

39:45.901 --> 39:47.992
- Help me! Help me!
- (cameras clicking)

39:48.070 --> 39:50.312
(sobbing): Help me!

39:50.439 --> 39:51.938
Help me!

39:51.974 --> 39:53.974
BULLOCK: Penguin ain't
gonna be too happy.

39:55.978 --> 39:57.731
Screw him.

39:58.687 --> 40:00.854
I'm just worried about
finding Jonathan Crane.

40:00.879 --> 40:03.417
If he's out there, with access
to his father's formula...

40:03.452 --> 40:05.318
Relax. We'll find him.

40:05.471 --> 40:07.823
I wouldn't expect too much help
from these parts, though.

40:08.008 --> 40:11.205
There's good cops out there.
They just need reminding.

40:29.078 --> 40:30.789
BRUCE: You have a list

40:30.946 --> 40:33.447
of all the licenses
you've given; I want it.

40:33.742 --> 40:36.149
I... I can't.

40:38.555 --> 40:40.125
Penguin, he'll...

40:40.522 --> 40:42.222

40:45.794 --> 40:48.228

Crane! You got to make more
of that fear gas.

41:50.538 --> 41:52.936
We got to get Merton out of jail! Crane!

41:57.777 --> 41:59.377
Crane?

42:03.193 --> 42:05.852
(distorted): Jonathan Crane
isn't here anymore.
