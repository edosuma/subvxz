01:53.646 --> 01:55.381
Doctor Crane, can you help me   
with somethin'?                 

01:55.448 --> 01:56.448
            Of course, Woody.   

01:56.516 --> 01:59.018
You know, uh,                   
yesterday was mine              

01:59.085 --> 02:01.487
and Kelly's third anniversary   
of goin' steady.                

02:01.588 --> 02:02.755
And, uh,                        

02:02.889 --> 02:04.823
I gave her                      
a dinky keychain,               

02:04.891 --> 02:08.127
so she goes and gives me        
this $300 camera.               

02:08.228 --> 02:09.961
So, my problem is...            

02:10.030 --> 02:11.630
            Say no more about   
                      it, Woody.

02:11.698 --> 02:13.732
    If I were you, I wouldn't   
        let Kelly's fine present

02:13.800 --> 02:15.100
            cause you any guilt.

02:15.168 --> 02:16.335
                I mean, after   
                  all, she comes

02:16.403 --> 02:17.836
                     from a very
        privileged background   

02:17.904 --> 02:20.673
              while you're a, an
                 unsophisticated
                     working man

02:20.774 --> 02:22.741
          who has nary two dimes
                to rub together.

02:22.809 --> 02:25.077
        You know, these kinds   
                of relationships

02:25.145 --> 02:27.146
          rarely make it through
                a third year.   

02:28.214 --> 02:30.149
Actually, I just                
wanted to know                  

02:30.216 --> 02:32.284
how to work                     
the automatic flash.            

02:32.352 --> 02:37.289
But now I just want             
to go someplace and cry.        

02:37.357 --> 02:39.324
                        Frasier,

02:39.426 --> 02:41.026
        I've got to run.        

02:41.094 --> 02:43.662
 I'm having my photograph taken 
      for a new I.D. badge      

02:43.763 --> 02:44.997
                     at the lab.

02:45.065 --> 02:47.533
          Are you gonna get your
             hair done for that?

02:47.634 --> 02:49.868
Why on earth should I?          

02:49.936 --> 02:53.305
 Well, at least get the tension 
      on that bun checked.      

02:53.373 --> 02:56.041
I mean, if that baby goes,      
        we're all dead.         

02:57.877 --> 03:00.479
That hardly seems just          
coming from a woman             

03:00.547 --> 03:02.314
whose hair has never            
seen a greasy pot               

03:02.382 --> 03:04.983
it couldn't                     
scrub clean.                    

03:06.286 --> 03:07.419
        Watch it, babe!         

03:07.487 --> 03:08.520
                        Ooh, I'm
                     outta here.

03:08.655 --> 03:10.723
    Now, now, girls, girls,     

03:10.790 --> 03:12.391
    there's no reason           
     to insult each other.      

03:12.459 --> 03:15.794
No matter how on the nose       
    either of you might be.     

03:19.733 --> 03:21.200
Frasier,                        

03:21.267 --> 03:23.035
do you think I should           
change my hair?                 

03:23.136 --> 03:26.372
            You're asking me?   

03:26.473 --> 03:28.340
            Just a second, dear.

03:29.442 --> 03:31.377
                Uh-oh, I'm in   
                    big trouble.

03:31.444 --> 03:32.878
                If I tell her   
                      to change,

03:32.946 --> 03:34.013
              she'll assume that
                I'm disappointed

03:34.080 --> 03:35.047
         with the way she looks.

03:35.115 --> 03:36.582
              On the other hand,

03:36.649 --> 03:38.917
    if I say it's fine as it is,
      she'll think I don't care.

03:39.019 --> 03:40.085
            You know, Lilith,   

03:40.220 --> 03:41.487
you should do with              

03:41.554 --> 03:43.989
      those raven tresses       
     whatever pleases you.      

03:44.057 --> 03:46.225
Because, my angel,              
if you're happy, I'm happy.     

03:46.326 --> 03:47.159
                 You're chicken.

03:47.360 --> 03:49.161
But happy.                      

03:49.262 --> 03:51.897
                For heaven sake,
                take a stand!   

03:51.998 --> 03:53.732
Just a second, dear.            

03:53.833 --> 03:56.835
              She's goin' to the
                mat on this one.

03:56.903 --> 03:59.738
Why don't you just tell her     
to get her hair changed?        

03:59.806 --> 04:01.473
        Perhaps you're right.   

04:01.541 --> 04:03.475
                You know, she   
                  probably wants

04:03.543 --> 04:05.477
            to change herself in
              some way, but, uh,

04:05.545 --> 04:07.546
     doesn't have the confidence
                 to just let go.

04:07.614 --> 04:09.982
             Lilith, I think you
                 should restyle.

04:10.050 --> 04:11.550
You know, to tell the truth,    
there is a,                     

04:11.618 --> 04:13.419
    a part of me that would,    

04:13.486 --> 04:16.288
would like to see a-a little    
change in your appearance.      

04:16.356 --> 04:17.723
                      Why?      

04:17.791 --> 04:20.059
Because you've secretly hated   
             the way I've looked

04:20.125 --> 04:22.961
     all these years and haven't
        had the guts to tell me?

04:23.063 --> 04:26.165
Just a second, dear.            

04:28.268 --> 04:31.003
             Taxi!              

04:33.006 --> 04:35.240
            That's exactly why I
              never got married.

04:35.308 --> 04:37.242
Oh, is that why,                
Cliff?                          

04:37.310 --> 04:39.244
            Yeah, that's why.   

04:41.481 --> 04:43.248
      Mornin', everybody.       

04:43.316 --> 04:44.383
        EVERYONE:               
             Norm!              

04:44.451 --> 04:45.484
Hey, what's goin' on,           
Normie?                         

04:45.585 --> 04:47.119
    It's my birthday, Sammy.    

04:47.187 --> 04:49.121
        Give me a beer, stick   
                 a candle in it.

04:49.189 --> 04:51.557
            And I'll blow out   
                    my liver.   

04:51.624 --> 04:52.925
Hey, it's his birthday.         

04:52.992 --> 04:54.226
Did ya hear that?               
        EVERYONE:               
     Happy birthday, Norm!      

04:54.294 --> 04:55.561
      I just want the day       

04:55.628 --> 04:57.496
         to come and go         
    just like any other day.    

04:57.597 --> 04:59.932
            Uh-huh.             
I think                         
you can pull that off.          

05:00.000 --> 05:01.367
     Well, Norm, you know,      
        despite the fact        

05:01.434 --> 05:03.202
  that you don't want to make   
     a big fuss out of it,      

05:03.269 --> 05:05.437
     we all, uh, chipped in     
     and got ya somethin'.      

05:05.505 --> 05:07.106
                  Now what is it
                    that, uh,   

05:07.173 --> 05:09.108
you want more than anything else
         in the world?          

05:09.175 --> 05:10.476
                Another beer.   

05:10.577 --> 05:12.578
                          CLIFF:
          Close your eyes there,
                Mr. Peterson.   

05:17.017 --> 05:18.951
        Yay!                    
                    Oh, guys!   

05:19.019 --> 05:20.252
Yay!                            

05:20.320 --> 05:22.221
            What could it be?   

05:22.288 --> 05:23.856
          Let me see.           

05:23.923 --> 05:25.290
            (gasps)             
          It's a beer!          

05:25.358 --> 05:28.160
                Thank you, guys.

05:28.228 --> 05:29.361
        Thank you.              

05:29.529 --> 05:32.064
Hey, I got you                  
a very,                         

05:32.132 --> 05:34.066
very special gift,              
my friend.                      

05:34.134 --> 05:35.300
          More special          
    than a free beer?           

05:35.368 --> 05:36.335
                Yeah. Come here.

05:36.403 --> 05:37.636
Is it a keg and a snorkel?      

05:37.704 --> 05:38.737
            (laughs)            

05:38.805 --> 05:40.139
    Come, stand right here.     

05:40.206 --> 05:42.274
Now I know what a big fan       
 of the Celtics you are, so...  

05:42.342 --> 05:44.209
    (knocking on door)          
      here's your present.      

05:46.846 --> 05:48.113
                  (Sam chuckles)

05:48.248 --> 05:51.183
Kevin McHale?                   

05:56.122 --> 05:58.190
Sammy, I love the guy,          

05:58.258 --> 06:00.426
but, uh, I know where           
to draw the line, you know?     

06:00.527 --> 06:02.327
                 No, no, no, no,
                    no, okay,   

06:02.395 --> 06:03.662
        he's just deliverin' it.
                 Come on, Kevin.

06:03.863 --> 06:05.464
      Norm, Sammy tells me      

06:05.532 --> 06:06.999
              what a big fan you
                are of the team,

06:07.067 --> 06:09.001
          so on behalf of myself
                and the Celtics,

06:09.069 --> 06:10.703
            I'd like you to have
            this team jacket.   
    Oh,                         

06:10.804 --> 06:12.738
all ri...                       
Thanks, man.                    
                 Happy birthday!

06:12.839 --> 06:14.340
        All right!              
                 Have a happy...

06:14.407 --> 06:15.474
         Look at this.          
Ah, hey.                        

06:15.542 --> 06:16.909
Hey. Smile.                     

06:17.010 --> 06:18.510
WOODY:                          
Hey, whoa, whoa,                
smile.                          

06:18.611 --> 06:20.546
    (camera shutter clicks)     

06:20.613 --> 06:22.848
Sam, how do you work            
the flash on this?              

06:22.916 --> 06:24.350
             I got my hands full
                    here, Woody.

06:24.417 --> 06:25.517
                        Oh!     

06:25.585 --> 06:27.853
    (glass shattering)          

06:30.090 --> 06:32.191
                      All right!

06:32.258 --> 06:34.226
        What a birthday, huh?   

06:34.294 --> 06:35.894
                    A free beer,

06:35.962 --> 06:38.297
        a Celtics jacket from   
                Kevin McHale,   

06:38.365 --> 06:40.366
                and Sammy wipi''
                 out my bar tab.
Hey,                            

06:40.433 --> 06:42.801
whoa, whoa, whoa.               

06:42.869 --> 06:45.304
I didn't say anything           
about wipin' out a bar tab.     

06:45.372 --> 06:47.673
                     Well, happy
                 birthday to me.

06:49.609 --> 06:50.642
          Hey, Sammy?           
Yeah.                           

06:50.710 --> 06:51.977
I came through with that jacket 
        for Norm.               

06:52.045 --> 06:53.946
    Where's that autographed    
Red Sox baseball you got for me?

06:54.047 --> 06:55.381
Oh, right, right.               
I'll be, I'll be right back.    

06:55.515 --> 06:56.648
                  All right.    

06:56.716 --> 06:58.450
      Is it almost ready?       

06:58.518 --> 06:59.485
      Yeah.                     

06:59.552 --> 07:00.552
How many G's                    
in Boggs?                       

07:00.620 --> 07:01.954
                     Two.       

07:02.122 --> 07:03.389
Is that all?                    

07:03.456 --> 07:04.890
Doesn't look                    
right.                          
                  Shh.          

07:05.825 --> 07:07.226
              Hey.              

07:07.293 --> 07:08.627
                All right.      

07:08.695 --> 07:09.962
        Thank you, Sam.         
        Let me use              

07:10.063 --> 07:11.163
                      the phone,
                      all right?
    Yeah, anytime. Anytime.     

07:11.297 --> 07:12.664
      Normie?                   
                         Yeah.  

07:12.732 --> 07:14.767
 Even though I, uh, chipped in  
  for the beer with the guys,   

07:14.834 --> 07:16.969
                         Mm-hmm.
    I also got you a little     
         special gift.          

07:17.037 --> 07:18.370
    Yeah? What's that?          

07:18.438 --> 07:20.372
      Well, uh, I did some      
      research on the, uh,      

07:20.440 --> 07:22.608
    historical significance     
         of birthdays.          

07:22.676 --> 07:24.610
        Uncovered a lot         
      of interesting facts      

07:24.678 --> 07:26.278
        and, uh...              

07:26.346 --> 07:29.314
    I'm not gonna share 'em     
            with ya.            

07:29.382 --> 07:31.283
                 Oh, Cliff, man.
Happy birthday,                 
big guy.                        

07:32.552 --> 07:34.319
Say, Kevin,                     

07:34.387 --> 07:36.488
you know, uh, my birthday's     
comin' up pretty soon.          

07:36.556 --> 07:38.657
Maybe you could come back       
and deliver somethin' for me.   

07:38.725 --> 07:39.992
              Oh, would you like
                  a jacket, too?

07:40.126 --> 07:40.993
Yeah, right.                    

07:41.061 --> 07:42.594
A jacket!                       

07:45.498 --> 07:49.101
 Well, guys, I feel like I own  
a little bit of Celtic history. 

07:49.169 --> 07:50.402
              Some of my fondest

07:50.470 --> 07:52.771
     memories as a boy are going
             down to the Garden.

07:52.839 --> 07:55.674
    Yeah.                       
      Being in the same building
            as all my heroes.   

07:55.775 --> 07:57.376
  Sittin' there next to my dad  

07:57.444 --> 07:59.978
     and as he ordered beer     
  after beer from the vendor,   

08:00.080 --> 08:01.647
            sayin' to myself,   

08:01.748 --> 08:05.250
      "Someday, someday."       

08:05.318 --> 08:06.552
That's great.                   

08:06.686 --> 08:08.721
Ah, the Garden.                 

08:08.788 --> 08:10.723
          Yes, perhaps          
        the most famous         

08:10.790 --> 08:12.191
        playing surface         
    in all of sports.           

08:12.292 --> 08:13.492
              Yep.              
Well, you know,                 

08:13.560 --> 08:15.127
             it's a little known
             fact that that, uh,

08:15.195 --> 08:17.196
                parquet floor   
                    is comprised

08:17.263 --> 08:20.232
            of 240 individual   
            squares held down   

08:20.300 --> 08:22.534
                 by 2,860 bolts.
                             Uh,

08:22.602 --> 08:23.902
             you're wrong there.

08:24.070 --> 08:25.804
            It's 2,880 bolts.   

08:25.872 --> 08:28.073
    And I got that from a member
            of the bull gang,   

08:28.141 --> 08:30.075
             the crew that works
                      the floor.

08:30.143 --> 08:31.643
     Well, I'm very sorry,      
             Norm,              

08:31.711 --> 08:34.013
        but my source is        
         unimpeachable.         

08:34.080 --> 08:35.047
            Yeah? Who's that?   

08:35.148 --> 08:37.182
                My ma.          

08:38.451 --> 08:39.551
    Why don't we settle this    
        right now?              

08:39.619 --> 08:40.953
      I'll call the Garden      
    and find out, huh?          

08:41.020 --> 08:42.621
Oh, yeah, yeah. Who're          
we supposed to talk to,         

08:42.688 --> 08:44.690
the guy in charge               
of bolts?                       

08:45.992 --> 08:46.959
     We've got McHale here.     

08:47.027 --> 08:48.193
Why don't we just ask him.      

08:48.261 --> 08:49.528
             Kevin?             
                        Yeah.   

08:49.596 --> 08:51.397
    Uh, tell this guy           
    how many bolts there are    

08:51.464 --> 08:52.731
  on the floor of the Garden,   
            please.             

08:52.832 --> 08:53.932
                    Well, I-I've
                never noticed   

08:54.000 --> 08:55.067
any bolts                       
in that floor.                  

08:55.135 --> 08:56.535
You know, come                  
to think of it,                 

08:56.636 --> 08:58.404
                Bird, Parish,   
                    Auerbach,   

08:58.505 --> 09:00.205
nobody knows how many bolts     
are in that floor, huh?         

09:00.306 --> 09:01.407
There's a game                  
for ya.                         
          Yeah.                 

09:01.474 --> 09:03.375
Trivia...                       
                      Hey, stop,
                     stop, stop!

09:03.443 --> 09:05.244
Stop it! Just turn around       
     and run the other way!     

09:05.345 --> 09:06.845
What're you                     
talking about?                  
                    Look, Kevin,

09:06.913 --> 09:08.881
                 I'm warning you
             because I love you.

09:08.948 --> 09:11.250
             Don't get caught up
                 in one of those
                  conversations.

09:11.317 --> 09:12.618
You'll end up                   
like those guys.                

09:12.786 --> 09:14.053
They never leave                
those stools.                   

09:15.689 --> 09:17.489
It's a disease, and they're     
tryin' to hook you.             

09:17.557 --> 09:19.091
I knew this guy once            

09:19.159 --> 09:21.427
who was a respected             
psychiatrist.                   

09:21.494 --> 09:23.929
It's too late                   
for him,                        

09:23.997 --> 09:25.898
but you can still               
save yourself.                  

09:25.965 --> 09:27.066
             Go on.             
            Okay, yeah, yeah,   

09:27.133 --> 09:28.434
you're... I got a game          
in an hour.                     

09:28.501 --> 09:30.336
Like to talk about those bolts, 
you guys, but I gotta run.      

09:30.403 --> 09:31.337
     (overlapping chatter)      

09:31.538 --> 09:33.605
        Thank God.              

09:33.673 --> 09:35.040
Hey, I'll tell you              
what, though.                   

09:35.108 --> 09:36.475
If you multiply                 
the number of bolts             

09:36.543 --> 09:37.910
      by number of squares      
         in that thing,         

09:37.977 --> 09:39.945
you'd be able to find out       
how many bolts there were.      

09:40.013 --> 09:41.947
     Oh Lord, take him now.     

09:47.987 --> 09:49.655
    ANNOUNCER (on TV):          
 One minute to go in the game.  
Here we go!                     

09:49.723 --> 09:50.923
The Celtics still have a chance 
         to tie it up.          

09:50.990 --> 09:52.925
     Brings the ball up...      
                  Come on, guys.

09:52.992 --> 09:54.593
Frasier...                      

09:57.030 --> 09:59.965
...I've just come               
from the beauty salon.          

10:00.066 --> 10:01.400
I asked them                    
to do something                 

10:01.534 --> 10:02.968
a little different              
with my hair.                   

10:03.036 --> 10:04.803
          Then you actually went
                through with it?

10:04.871 --> 10:07.139
            My darling, I'm, I'm
            all anticipation.   

10:07.207 --> 10:08.307
                 I've never seen
                        you out,

10:08.375 --> 10:11.143
            but with your by-now
              trademark chignon.

10:11.211 --> 10:14.146
Thus the change.                

10:19.886 --> 10:21.820
What do you think,              
Frasier?                        

10:21.921 --> 10:23.856
            It's hard to say.   

10:34.167 --> 10:36.101
(laughs)                        

10:37.237 --> 10:39.738
        You're laughing!        

10:39.806 --> 10:41.306
(laughing):                     
I'm sorry, dear.                

10:41.374 --> 10:42.641
You're taking it                
all the wrong way.              

10:42.709 --> 10:44.143
You see, it was just            
the initial reaction            

10:44.210 --> 10:45.310
of seeing you                   
different and...                

10:45.378 --> 10:47.246
you know, now that I look       
at it again, it's...            

10:47.313 --> 10:49.581
(laughing)                      

10:49.649 --> 10:50.749
         Stop laughing.         

10:50.817 --> 10:51.950
  You're hurting my feelings.   

10:52.018 --> 10:52.851
  I'm sorry.                    

10:52.919 --> 10:54.787
 Your what?                     

10:54.854 --> 10:56.288
No, no, darling,                
please, please.                 

10:56.356 --> 10:57.956
                Look, give me   
                 another chance.

10:58.024 --> 10:58.991
                         Please.

10:59.059 --> 11:00.025
                 Another chance.

11:00.093 --> 11:02.027
                         Please!

11:02.095 --> 11:04.029
                        (laughs)

11:07.133 --> 11:09.868
 Ten seconds to go, the Celtics 
down by two on their home court.

11:09.936 --> 11:11.870
     McHale's got the ball.     

11:11.938 --> 11:13.105
            He goes up.         
  Yeah!                         

11:13.173 --> 11:14.506
    He's in the clear.          

11:14.574 --> 11:16.675
 Oh no! McHale blows the layup! 

11:16.743 --> 11:17.843
         (game buzzer)          

11:17.911 --> 11:19.011
      And that's the game.      

11:19.079 --> 11:20.179
    The Celtics lose.           

11:20.246 --> 11:22.815
Cleveland 102, Boston 100.      

11:22.882 --> 11:24.616
I've never seen                 
Kevin play                      

11:24.684 --> 11:25.951
that poorly before              
in my life.                     

11:26.019 --> 11:27.252
              What was he doin''
                      out there?

11:27.354 --> 11:28.787
I don't know. I mean,           
he wasn't even looking'         

11:28.855 --> 11:29.755
at the other players.           

11:29.823 --> 11:31.156
He was just staring'            
at the floor                    

11:31.224 --> 11:31.990
and moving his lips.            

11:33.426 --> 11:35.961
        I think he was countin''
         the bolts on the floor.

11:36.029 --> 11:37.096
No, come on.                    

11:37.163 --> 11:38.430
He wouldn't do that             
in the middle of a game.        

11:38.498 --> 11:39.231
    Hey, look, they're gonna    
        interview Kevin.        

11:39.299 --> 11:40.499
          Here's Glen.          

11:40.567 --> 11:42.568
      This is Glen Ordway       
  on the floor of the Garden.   

11:42.635 --> 11:44.737
        We're gonna see         
 if we can catch Kevin McHale,  

11:44.804 --> 11:46.138
 ask him a couple of questions  

11:46.206 --> 11:48.140
      and find out exactly      
        what went wrong         

11:48.208 --> 11:49.608
 out on the floor here tonight. 

11:49.676 --> 11:51.276
  Uh, here he comes right now.  

11:51.344 --> 11:53.679
    Uh, Kevin, can I ask you    
     a couple of questions?     

11:53.747 --> 11:55.447
Hundred and nine,               
hundred and ten,                

11:55.515 --> 11:57.216
hundred and eleven,             
hundred and twelve...           

11:57.317 --> 11:59.184
Now look what you've done!      

11:59.285 --> 12:01.220
      You have ruined him!      

12:01.287 --> 12:03.422
  You've ruined Kevin McHale!   

12:03.490 --> 12:04.923
                        You took
                     the scoring

12:04.991 --> 12:08.260
machine, one of Boston's        
greatest living sports legends  

12:08.328 --> 12:09.695
and turned him                  
into...                         

12:09.763 --> 12:12.698
          one of you!           

12:14.200 --> 12:18.804
        GUYS (chanting):        
 Kevin, Kevin, Kevin, Kevin...  

12:26.346 --> 12:28.714
         (phone rings)          

12:28.782 --> 12:30.749
Cheers.                         

12:30.817 --> 12:31.917
  Yeah, Sammy, this is Kevin.   

12:31.985 --> 12:33.485
          Hey, Kevin!           
    Hey, Kevin McHale.          

12:33.553 --> 12:34.987
            OTHERS:             
          Hey, Kevin!           

12:35.088 --> 12:37.489
                Hey, Sammy, boy,
    I'm having a rough night.   

12:37.557 --> 12:39.725
        Yeah, ooh, boy,         
      we caught the game.       

12:39.793 --> 12:41.794
  Yeah, you really stunk it up  
        out there, huh?         

12:41.861 --> 12:43.896
     Hey, I saw you pitch.      

12:43.963 --> 12:45.698
      You're not entitled       
         to an opinion.         

12:45.765 --> 12:48.300
      You know what it is,      
        though...               

12:48.368 --> 12:49.601
    it's those bolts.           

12:49.669 --> 12:51.303
  I tell you, I can't get them  
        out of my mind.         

12:51.371 --> 12:53.372
You know, I've called the people
         all over town,         

12:53.440 --> 12:54.940
 and no two people seem to have 
        the same answer.        

12:55.008 --> 12:56.975
 Sammy, it's driving me crazy.  

12:57.043 --> 12:58.911
 Kevin, you, you got to take it 
        easy with this.         

12:58.978 --> 13:00.846
     I mean, bar trivia can     
        eat you up, pal.        

13:00.914 --> 13:03.048
Kevin, it's not too late!       
        Get help!               

13:03.116 --> 13:04.149
Don't...                        

13:04.217 --> 13:05.918
Honey, who's that?              

13:05.985 --> 13:07.419
                Just the guys   
                 down at Cheers.

13:07.487 --> 13:09.922
(sighs)                         

13:18.431 --> 13:21.300
My motive, of course,           
was to please Frasier.          

13:21.368 --> 13:23.102
But this evening, after dinner, 

13:23.169 --> 13:26.472
      he laughed so hard,       
cappuccino ran out of his nose. 

13:28.541 --> 13:30.809
Rebecca, you're a friend.       

13:30.877 --> 13:34.947
Does this permanent make my hair
    look utterly ridiculous?    

13:35.015 --> 13:36.782
                 No, not at all.

13:36.850 --> 13:38.684
                I think it's    
            a delightful change.

13:38.752 --> 13:39.885
            So do I.            

13:39.953 --> 13:41.320
    Damn that Frasier!          

13:41.388 --> 13:44.590
    For a moment, he had me     
believing I was a laughingstock.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.392
Thank you.                      

13:46.459 --> 13:48.861
            Don't mention it.   
            What're friends for?

13:50.430 --> 13:51.730
                How can you just
                    stand there,

13:51.798 --> 13:54.933
          staring at that hairdo
    and not bust a gut laughing?

13:55.001 --> 13:57.903
(voice straining):              
No problem.                     

14:00.473 --> 14:02.174
         Hi, everybody!         

14:02.242 --> 14:03.409
          Hey, Kevin!           

14:03.510 --> 14:05.644
                        FRASIER:
                 How come you're
                not in bed, man?

14:05.712 --> 14:07.579
Oh, I couldn't sleep.           

14:07.647 --> 14:08.881
  You got a big game tomorrow.  

14:09.049 --> 14:10.416
         I don't care.          

14:11.885 --> 14:14.219
      All I care about are      
          those bolts.          

14:14.287 --> 14:16.522
So I ran out and got a set      
  of blueprints to the Garden.  

14:16.589 --> 14:19.024
 Find out how many bolts there  
  are in that floor right now.  

14:19.092 --> 14:21.460
 Wait a minute. Where'd you get 
 blueprints this time of night? 

14:21.561 --> 14:23.062
Ah, I know somebody             
down at City Hall.              

14:23.129 --> 14:25.464
         Kind of a sports legend
              in this town, huh?

14:25.532 --> 14:26.732
Oh, yeah?                       
Yeah, all right.                

14:26.800 --> 14:28.734
            Oh, hey, gee, there,
            I'm sorry, Kevin,   

14:28.802 --> 14:30.102
                but these are   
                  the blueprints

14:30.170 --> 14:31.370
              for the new Garden
          that they're building.

14:31.438 --> 14:32.504
  No...                         
            Yeah, yeah, you see,

14:32.572 --> 14:35.607
                 there should be
          a mailbox right there.

14:35.675 --> 14:37.476
No, no.                         

14:37.577 --> 14:39.211
Oh, give me that phone!         
I hope the mayor's still up.    

14:39.279 --> 14:40.713
Give me that phone.             
                     No, no, no.

14:40.780 --> 14:42.881
  I don't think you should do   
that, man. Don't do that.       

14:42.949 --> 14:44.983
Sammy, I'm telling you          
right now, I got to know.       

14:45.051 --> 14:46.251
I got to know.                  
I'm telling you, nothing,       

14:46.319 --> 14:47.653
I mean nothing's                
going to stop me.               

14:47.754 --> 14:49.988
             Kevin.             

14:50.090 --> 14:52.691
    Good night, guys.           

14:55.228 --> 14:57.296
              You guys should be
          ashamed of yourselves.

14:57.364 --> 14:58.764
        You're like vampires.   

14:58.832 --> 15:02.434
                     Big-butted,
            do-nothing vampires.

15:02.502 --> 15:05.070
             And, and now you're
            trying to make Kevin
        one of your recruits.   

15:05.138 --> 15:06.605
                     Well, I say
            it's got to stop.   

15:06.673 --> 15:08.974
        I'm not going to let you
            screw up his career.

15:09.042 --> 15:10.509
Oh, come on,                    
lighten up, will you?           

15:10.577 --> 15:12.177
It's just Kevin's getting       
a little carried away           

15:12.245 --> 15:13.345
with bolts, that's all.         

15:13.446 --> 15:14.813
Yeah, sure, Sammy.              

15:14.914 --> 15:16.248
    Today it's how many bolts   
            are in the floor.   

15:16.316 --> 15:17.916
                Tomorrow they'll
                have him onto   

15:17.984 --> 15:19.885
             "If the Brady Bunch
        crashes in the Andes,   

15:19.953 --> 15:22.221
              who's going to eat
                     who first?"

15:24.424 --> 15:26.925
Well, they'd probably eat       
 the maid 'cause she ain't kin. 

15:29.963 --> 15:31.864
        Well, you know,         
  but if they're smart there,   

15:31.931 --> 15:34.833
they'll ask her first how       
she should best prepare herself.

15:34.901 --> 15:38.704
            Stop it!            

15:38.772 --> 15:39.838
All right,                      
so what do we do?               

15:39.906 --> 15:40.873
      Well, we'll go down       
         to the Garden          

15:40.940 --> 15:43.042
    and just count the bolts    
         in the floor,          

15:43.109 --> 15:45.244
  so we can settle this thing   
and get Kevin back on his game. 

15:45.311 --> 15:46.445
                      All right?

15:46.513 --> 15:47.513
          Well, how are we going
        to get in there, Sam?   

15:47.580 --> 15:48.747
                 Don't they lock
            the Garden at night?

15:48.815 --> 15:50.883
        Oh, hey, Woody, don't   
        worry about those locks.

15:50.950 --> 15:52.251
                 We can get past
                any one of them,

15:52.318 --> 15:53.552
                  with my trusty
            Swiss Army Knife.   

15:53.653 --> 15:55.220
          (chuckles):           
    Yeah, I got the big one     

15:55.288 --> 15:58.123
with the, uh,                   
tweezer-toothpick combo.        

15:58.191 --> 16:00.225
Yeah.                           
            That's a beauty,    
              Mr. Clavin.       

16:00.293 --> 16:01.660
      Yeah, thanks, Woody.      

16:01.728 --> 16:04.797
Yeah, every soldier in the Swiss
    Army owns one of these.     

16:04.864 --> 16:06.665
        That's why nobody messes
            with Switzerland.   

16:06.733 --> 16:09.902
Yeah, I'd rather run buck naked 
through the neighborhood        

16:09.969 --> 16:11.337
than be without this baby.      

16:11.404 --> 16:13.672
    Why is that always          
    the other option?           

16:20.747 --> 16:23.615
        (lights buzzing)        

16:23.750 --> 16:26.552
          Whoa, ho-ho!          

16:26.619 --> 16:27.519
                          WOODY:
                    Are they on?

16:27.587 --> 16:29.555
                    Uh, yeah!   

16:29.656 --> 16:31.557
    Look at this, huh?          

16:31.658 --> 16:33.258
         Boston Garden.         

16:33.326 --> 16:35.894
    I wake up this morning,     
thinking my life has no meaning,

16:35.995 --> 16:38.997
and now I'm standing here.      

16:39.065 --> 16:40.199
  Yeah, it really, really kind  
      of clears things up,      

16:40.266 --> 16:41.600
    doesn't it, Norm?           

16:41.668 --> 16:43.802
No, I'm still pretty sure       
    my life has no meaning,     

16:43.870 --> 16:46.138
     but I'm standing <i>here.</i>     

16:46.206 --> 16:47.439
(laughs)                        

16:47.507 --> 16:49.975
    Every part of this place    
    is special to me.           

16:50.043 --> 16:50.809
             Yeah.              

16:50.877 --> 16:52.678
                    It's sacred.

16:52.746 --> 16:54.747
        It's holy,              
  you know, like a cathedral.   

16:56.082 --> 16:57.516
    Think I'll rip a seat out   

16:57.617 --> 16:59.184
        and throw it in the back
                 of my car, huh?

16:59.252 --> 17:01.153
        Hey, wait a minute...   
What? What?                     

17:01.221 --> 17:02.121
          Forget that.          
What?                           

17:02.222 --> 17:04.289
        Hey, Mr. Clavin,        
    I have a question.          

17:04.357 --> 17:05.624
                      Yeah, fire
                     away there.

17:05.692 --> 17:08.093
Well, how can they play hockey  
in here-- there's no ice?       

17:08.194 --> 17:10.762
Oh, the ice is, uh, right       
 under the floor there, Woody.  

17:10.829 --> 17:12.364
It's under the floor right now? 

17:12.432 --> 17:13.365
          Absolutely!           

17:13.433 --> 17:14.566
         Why don't you, uh, pick

17:14.634 --> 17:16.468
             one of these things
            up, have a look-see?

17:16.536 --> 17:18.237
              Here, use my      
        Swiss Army Knife.       

17:18.304 --> 17:20.305
    Suppose anyone would mind   
         if we shot a few hoops?

17:20.373 --> 17:21.740
Hey, where'd you get that?      

17:21.808 --> 17:23.642
Out of the trunk of my car since
  last time I was at the gym.   

17:23.710 --> 17:25.010
Let's run the floor.            
                      All right!

17:25.178 --> 17:27.746
    Here we go! Here we go!     

17:29.249 --> 17:31.150
(chuckling):                    
When was the last time          
you were at the gym?            

17:31.217 --> 17:32.418
                I don't know.   

17:32.485 --> 17:33.619
            I used to go to that
        one next door to Cheers.

17:33.687 --> 17:35.354
         There's no gym         
      next door to Cheers.      

17:35.422 --> 17:36.288
                Yeah, there was.
              They tore it down.

17:36.356 --> 17:37.389
                     They put up
                 that bookstore.

17:37.457 --> 17:38.657
      There's no bookstore      
         there either.          

17:38.725 --> 17:40.726
         Oh, they tore that down
    and they put the bank there.

17:40.794 --> 17:42.261
The bank's been there           
as long as I can remember.      

17:42.328 --> 17:43.829
             Well, there you go.

17:44.464 --> 17:46.932
WOODY:                          
Wow!                            

17:47.000 --> 17:48.967
                 Well, what have
                        we here?

17:49.035 --> 17:50.703
Looks like plywood.             

17:50.770 --> 17:54.039
        Oh, great!              
    Hey, I can use the saw.     

17:54.107 --> 17:56.008
        (thumping)              

17:56.076 --> 17:57.943
                  Oh, great,    
              somebody's coming.

17:58.011 --> 17:59.545
                Woody, put, put,
             put the floor back.

17:59.612 --> 18:01.146
Come on, let's go.              

18:03.883 --> 18:05.951
          Woody, come on.       
             Hurry up.          

18:07.754 --> 18:09.088
          What a day.           

18:09.155 --> 18:11.790
      First Sammy gets me       
     Kevin McHale's jacket.     

18:11.858 --> 18:14.159
      Then I get to sneak       
    around the Garden.          

18:14.227 --> 18:16.595
    Even look at the plywood    
        under the floor.        

18:16.663 --> 18:18.731
  Now we're getting chased off  
      by security guards.       

18:18.798 --> 18:20.299
            (laughs)            

18:20.367 --> 18:21.967
        I'm sorry, guys.        

18:22.035 --> 18:24.536
I never had a more beautiful day
          in my life.           

18:29.109 --> 18:30.776
                 Drinking alone?

18:30.844 --> 18:34.847
No. Frasier asked to meet       
me to be here today.            

18:34.948 --> 18:37.316
    He probably wants a few     
      more boorish laughs       

18:37.384 --> 18:39.518
     at my hair's expense.      

18:39.586 --> 18:41.887
         Well, if it's          
    any consolation to you,     

18:41.955 --> 18:43.989
     I think that look does     
    something for you.          

18:44.057 --> 18:45.758
        Thank you.              

18:45.825 --> 18:47.426
    I didn't say what.          

18:51.398 --> 18:52.331
            Lilith?             

18:52.399 --> 18:55.367
Uh, please, don't speak.        

18:55.468 --> 18:57.836
I've behaved abominably.        

18:57.904 --> 19:00.572
You had the courage to try      
something different             

19:00.640 --> 19:02.107
in order to please me,          

19:02.175 --> 19:04.076
and I've repaid you             
with mockery,                   

19:04.144 --> 19:05.711
which is unforgivable.          

19:05.779 --> 19:09.648
But I, I hope you can           
forgive me because I love you.  

19:09.716 --> 19:11.250
And I love your hair.           

19:11.317 --> 19:14.486
And no matter how you might     
change your outer appearance,   

19:14.554 --> 19:19.058
you'll always be                
the most beautiful woman        
in the world to me.             

19:19.125 --> 19:20.392
                    Oh, Frasier!

19:30.737 --> 19:33.439
        Thanks, Rebecca.        

19:33.506 --> 19:35.174
Oh, I better keep one.          

19:37.077 --> 19:39.712
                        NORM:   
                There you go.   

19:39.779 --> 19:42.881
Yeah, McHale's playing          
a little better tonight, huh?   

19:42.949 --> 19:45.150
 Yeah, of course he is. As soon 
  as I told him how many bolts  

19:45.218 --> 19:46.385
were in the floor, he just      
  settled right into his game.  

19:46.453 --> 19:47.753
        Wait a minute. How could
              you tell him that?

19:47.821 --> 19:49.254
        We never had a chance   
                  to count them.

19:49.322 --> 19:52.558
 Well, I just made up a number, 
        you know.               

19:52.625 --> 19:54.426
I figure he'll never know       
        the difference.         

19:54.494 --> 19:56.795
As long as it improves his game,
you know, what's the harm?      

19:56.896 --> 19:58.397
             Right.             

19:58.465 --> 20:00.165
                          WOODY:
                     Sam, I have
                     a question.

20:00.233 --> 20:02.701
    Not now, Woody, I'm, uh,    
    watching the game here.     

20:02.769 --> 20:03.936
No, it's                        
really important.               

20:04.037 --> 20:05.637
             What?              

20:05.705 --> 20:08.107
Well, say a guy removed         
the bolts from a piece of floor 

20:08.174 --> 20:09.541
in a very                       
important building.             
                    Uh-huh.     

20:09.609 --> 20:12.644
Like, uh, I don't know,         
say, the Boston Garden.         

20:12.712 --> 20:14.013
And, and say a guard came,      

20:14.080 --> 20:17.649
and he didn't have time to put  
the bolts back in the floor.    

20:17.717 --> 20:19.284
What would happen?              

20:19.352 --> 20:21.954
        You didn't put the bolts
    back in the floor, Woody?   

20:22.022 --> 20:23.689
Oh, I knew                      
you'd catch that.               

20:23.757 --> 20:26.692
I should of just been           
honest with you, Sam.           

20:26.760 --> 20:28.660
What should I do?               

20:28.728 --> 20:31.163
  Oh, relax, will you, Woody?   
      For crying out loud,      

20:31.231 --> 20:32.965
 they got a crew there to check 
 on everything before the game. 

20:33.066 --> 20:34.533
        Yeah, I'm sure they just
         found the missing bolts

20:34.601 --> 20:36.001
              and replaced them.

20:36.102 --> 20:38.337
  I mean, even if they don't,   
I mean, what are the odds       

20:38.405 --> 20:40.639
 of somebody hitting that spot  
         exactly, huh?          

20:40.707 --> 20:42.741
         TV ANNOUNCER:          
     Bird passes to McHale.     

20:42.809 --> 20:44.476
      McHale is in for it,      
          stops short.          

20:44.544 --> 20:46.478
 Oh, he's tripped on something! 

20:46.579 --> 20:47.713
        He's down!              

20:47.781 --> 20:49.481
     It looks like a piece      
     of the floor came up.      

20:49.549 --> 20:52.551
 That hurt just looking at it!  

20:52.619 --> 20:54.887
Oh, no!                         

20:54.954 --> 20:56.522
I really did it                 
this time.                      

20:56.623 --> 20:58.824
No, no, no, no, no, no.         
Don't blame yourself, Woody.    

20:58.925 --> 20:59.825
         It's my fault.         

20:59.893 --> 21:01.527
      It was my birthday.       

21:01.594 --> 21:03.996
    I'm the one who got him     
  all interested in the bolts.  

21:04.064 --> 21:06.298
     No, no, it's me who dragged
                 us all out here

21:06.366 --> 21:08.033
            in the middle of the
        night to go count bolts.

21:08.101 --> 21:09.168
                It was my fault.

21:09.235 --> 21:10.302
  Oh, never would've happened   

21:10.370 --> 21:13.639
        if I didn't have        
      my Swiss Army Knife.      

21:13.707 --> 21:14.840
Guys, it was my fault.          

21:14.908 --> 21:16.709
I'm the one who took            
the bolts out of the floor.     

21:16.810 --> 21:19.011
     He's right, you know.      

21:19.112 --> 21:21.213
            That's true. Why are
                we being so hard
                on ourselves?   

21:21.281 --> 21:22.915
      Yeah, you heard him       
    admit that, didn't you?     

21:22.982 --> 21:24.817
    You guys, you heard it?     

21:34.961 --> 21:36.528
Hey, Kevin, how are you feeling?

21:36.596 --> 21:38.197
      Not too good, Woody.      

21:38.264 --> 21:39.264
          I don't know          
    what happened out there.    

21:39.332 --> 21:41.200
I must look like an idiot.      

21:41.267 --> 21:43.202
                It was my fault.

21:43.269 --> 21:44.870
  How could it be your fault?   

21:44.938 --> 21:47.239
         I'm the clown          
     that slipped and fell.     

21:47.340 --> 21:48.540
         You're right.          
        You were.               

21:48.608 --> 21:50.542
      You heard him, guys,      
     let's get out of here.     

21:50.610 --> 21:52.277
                 Listen, we have
                    a confession
                 to make, Kevin.

21:52.345 --> 21:53.512
                Uh, when we came

21:53.580 --> 21:55.647
    over here the other night   
             to count the bolts,

21:55.715 --> 21:57.249
                  we kind of got
                    carried away

21:57.317 --> 22:00.552
        and kind of took some of
    the bolts out and then...   

22:00.653 --> 22:03.722
            kind of forgot to   
            put them back in.   

22:03.790 --> 22:05.991
      You mean to tell me       
this really is your fault?      

22:06.059 --> 22:07.593
                  I'm afraid so.

22:07.660 --> 22:08.627
    Boy, that figures.          

22:08.695 --> 22:11.363
         With you guys,         
      that really figures.      

22:13.533 --> 22:14.733
 You know, I'll tell you what,  
            though,             

22:14.801 --> 22:16.201
      I guess I can't stay      
         too mad at you         

22:16.269 --> 22:18.404
'cause you finally solved       
 that bolt question, you know.  

22:18.471 --> 22:22.041
                  We got another
             confession to make.

22:22.108 --> 22:24.743
  We kind of never got around   
     to counting the bolts.     

22:24.844 --> 22:26.745
 Wait a minute. Wait a minute.  
     You trying to tell me,     

22:26.813 --> 22:28.247
  we still don't know how many  
 bolts there are in that floor? 

22:28.314 --> 22:30.249
            Yeah, but what is   
            the difference, man?
        You played a great game.

22:30.316 --> 22:31.850
         Yeah, but what         
     about tomorrow's game?     

22:34.187 --> 22:37.589
                    NORM:       
                    ...1,216... 

22:37.657 --> 22:39.425
                     1,217...   

22:39.492 --> 22:41.894
            McHALE:             
        No, no, hold on.        
  I already counted that one.   

22:43.596 --> 22:46.632
                     (sighs)    

22:47.734 --> 22:49.435
                    One...      

22:49.502 --> 22:51.503
                 <i>two... three...</i>
