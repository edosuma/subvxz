13:13.059 --> 13:14.584
Then why didn't they keep me?

13:14.761 --> 13:17.492
Why didn't they sign the paper
that made me their son?

13:18.898 --> 13:20.866
Why did I keep coming home
from school...

13:21.034 --> 13:24.026
...and find my suitcase packed
by their front doors?

13:24.203 --> 13:27.138
Leon, you know that
a foster home is temporary.

13:27.307 --> 13:31.301
It's a place that you go until the folks come
who are gonna adopt you permanently.

13:31.477 --> 13:32.967
Yeah.

13:33.146 --> 13:34.705
Well, it's been 12 years.

13:35.848 --> 13:39.250
How come nobody has come
to claim this little bundle of joy yet?

13:39.419 --> 13:41.114
Because...

13:47.593 --> 13:49.027
I don't know.

13:49.195 --> 13:50.924
Yeah, well, I do.

13:51.097 --> 13:53.759
Hey, don't you get it, Stone?

13:53.933 --> 13:55.731
This is the end of the line.

13:55.902 --> 13:57.563
Nobody is gonna adopt me.

13:57.737 --> 14:01.332
They want babies,
or haven't you heard?

14:01.507 --> 14:03.498
They want diapers to change.

14:03.676 --> 14:06.702
They want cribs with cute little blankets.

14:07.080 --> 14:09.242
They want snapshots of your first steps.

14:09.849 --> 14:13.911
I'm 12 years old.
That's middle age in the adoption game.

14:14.087 --> 14:17.546
And don't bother telling me I'm not,
because it's just talk.

14:17.724 --> 14:19.590
I've heard it from that lady upstairs...

14:19.759 --> 14:22.524
...and I've heard it from half a dozen people
just like her.

14:22.695 --> 14:25.665
And I sure as heck
don't wanna hear it from you.

14:32.472 --> 14:35.237
Now the Beaver has gotta move too.

14:44.417 --> 14:49.184
Of course, all I ever heard about this floor
were only rumors.

14:49.355 --> 14:51.653
BULL:
Still no sign of him!

14:53.426 --> 14:55.394
Thanks for the update.

14:55.862 --> 14:58.160
Okay, call off the bloodhounds.

14:58.331 --> 14:59.355
Leon.

14:59.532 --> 15:02.001
Lady, if you're from the state,
I'm ready to roll.

15:02.168 --> 15:04.637
You and me both, Leon.

15:05.171 --> 15:09.130
Oh, look. The monogrammed
rubber sheets are on sale.

15:11.377 --> 15:12.469
Let's go.

15:12.645 --> 15:14.374
CHRISTINE:
Wait a minute.

15:14.547 --> 15:17.573
What's gonna happen to him?
Where is he gonna go?

15:18.985 --> 15:22.922
Because of his record,
Leon has been reclassified as incorrigible.

15:23.489 --> 15:26.390
- And?
- And instead of another foster home...

15:26.559 --> 15:30.086
...he'll go to a group shelter
until we can find him adoptive parents.

15:30.496 --> 15:32.225
Meaning I'm there till I'm dead.

15:32.398 --> 15:34.457
Now, that's not necessarily true, Leon.

15:34.634 --> 15:35.965
Oh, yeah, right.

15:36.135 --> 15:38.502
There's an off chance
that Peter Pan will fly in...

15:38.671 --> 15:40.605
...and carry me off to Never Neverland.

15:40.773 --> 15:42.207
HARRY:
Or I will.

15:43.509 --> 15:44.704
Say what?

15:50.550 --> 15:52.450
Could I keep him?

15:54.253 --> 15:56.551
You mean in a jar, of course.

15:57.857 --> 15:59.552
In my home.

15:59.959 --> 16:02.087
Could I be his foster parent?

16:03.629 --> 16:06.223
You want me to move in with you?

16:06.933 --> 16:07.957
Yeah.

16:08.134 --> 16:09.226
Yeah, I do.

16:11.504 --> 16:12.994
Why?

16:15.174 --> 16:18.439
Because of an old saying
that Leon reminded me of.

16:18.744 --> 16:20.644
Put up or shut up.

16:21.481 --> 16:24.576
It's a very generous offer, Judge Stone.

16:24.750 --> 16:26.912
But you realize
it may be quite some time...

16:27.086 --> 16:30.420
...before we find a
permanent adoptive home for Leon.

16:30.590 --> 16:33.890
Hey, thanks for bringing that up.

16:34.427 --> 16:36.122
Mrs. Lund...

16:37.230 --> 16:40.291
...I want Leon for as long as it takes.

16:40.633 --> 16:43.261
I will enjoy him while he's there.

16:46.005 --> 16:48.133
And I will miss him when he's gone.

16:51.477 --> 16:53.241
What do you say, huh?

16:54.146 --> 16:56.774
I mean, <i>we've</i> always gotten along,
right?

16:57.316 --> 16:58.977
And I've always wanted a son.

17:00.820 --> 17:06.054
Most of all, of course, I've always wanted
a video cassette recorder.

17:15.300 --> 17:17.895
Oh, that is so beautiful.

17:18.069 --> 17:22.530
Just out of the blue reaching out
to touch someone's life like that.

17:22.708 --> 17:25.301
Harry must feel very fulfilled.

17:25.478 --> 17:27.377
I'm sure he does.

17:27.547 --> 17:30.517
That's probably why
he doesn't mind the snot.

17:34.453 --> 17:36.547
I think I ruined your shirt.

17:36.722 --> 17:39.123
It's okay. Just don't make me look.

17:41.861 --> 17:43.295
Mrs. Lund.

17:44.263 --> 17:47.528
This certainly is an unusual request.

17:47.700 --> 17:52.536
But then again,
you are a municipal court judge.

17:52.872 --> 17:57.036
Presumably a stable,
responsible member of the community.

17:57.209 --> 17:58.973
Your sneakers match.

18:01.047 --> 18:03.778
You're lucky she caught you
on a good night.

18:06.586 --> 18:08.418
I'm gonna go and talk to my supervisor.

18:11.490 --> 18:14.391
I'm positive that
we can arrange something.

18:15.294 --> 18:17.490
LEON:
All right.

18:17.663 --> 18:20.360
Congratulations.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.230
Well, I'll be.

18:23.402 --> 18:25.496
Congratulations, sir.

18:25.671 --> 18:27.469
Thank you. Thank you.

18:28.874 --> 18:30.638
Congratulations for what?

18:30.810 --> 18:32.471
Harry is gonna be a father.

18:32.645 --> 18:35.979
Hey, how about that.

18:36.148 --> 18:37.912
Anybody you know?

18:39.018 --> 18:42.511
Well, he's taking in Leon, Flo.

18:42.688 --> 18:46.556
Yeah, we all drew straws. Harry lost.

18:48.728 --> 18:49.957
<i>Soon .</i>

18:50.129 --> 18:52.621
Very soon.

18:54.233 --> 18:56.065
Congratulations, sir.
HARRY: Thank you, guys.

18:56.235 --> 18:57.760
Good luck, sir.

18:59.038 --> 19:01.564
Sir, I...

19:04.310 --> 19:05.573
I...

19:14.053 --> 19:17.683
When she gets emotional,
she only knows one vowel.

19:19.425 --> 19:21.917
Thanks, Harry. Thanks a lot.

19:22.361 --> 19:23.658
You're welcome.

19:23.829 --> 19:25.729
But now, we gotta have a deal, Leon.

19:25.898 --> 19:28.560
There's no more tricks.
There's no running away.

19:30.069 --> 19:31.093
Deal.

19:32.938 --> 19:34.838
We're out of here.

19:35.141 --> 19:36.734
Harry...

19:38.244 --> 19:41.339
...I know this is gonna sound stupid
and all...

19:41.514 --> 19:44.211
...but tonight,
could you read me a bedtime story?

19:44.684 --> 19:47.779
That doesn't sound stupid at all, Leon.
I would love to.

19:47.953 --> 19:49.478
Great.

19:49.655 --> 19:52.090
I'm up to chapter six.

19:52.925 --> 19:56.293

19:58.798 --> 20:01.426
All right, let's make that a $50 fine
and time served.

20:01.600 --> 20:04.092
That's a wrap, people.

20:04.270 --> 20:06.295
Sony, Mac.

20:10.209 --> 20:13.839
It's like being in a Moroccan restaurant.

20:14.880 --> 20:17.577
- Dan Fielding?
- Yes, and you are?

20:17.750 --> 20:19.514
Nancy Hines from Records.

20:19.685 --> 20:21.449
I have some data for you.

20:21.620 --> 20:22.951
Toss it in there, please.

20:23.122 --> 20:26.490
Sorry, I was asked to toss it up here.

20:41.107 --> 20:43.599
It's from a friend.

20:58.390 --> 21:02.054
It was one of you, wasn't it?

21:02.628 --> 21:06.064
And it was worth every penny.

21:08.667 --> 21:13.229
Flo, that is very nice,
but you don't have to cover for me.

21:13.405 --> 21:15.703
I called them, Dan.

21:15.875 --> 21:17.536
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

21:17.710 --> 21:19.974
You don't have to cover for me.

21:20.146 --> 21:21.614
I was the one that called them.

21:21.781 --> 21:24.944
Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

21:26.719 --> 21:28.847
It was me.

21:30.022 --> 21:31.888
You want the truth?

21:33.459 --> 21:34.927
It was all of you.

It was?

[DAN CHUCKLES]

21:39.298 --> 21:40.766
I knew you couldn't resist it.

21:40.933 --> 21:45.928
I knew you would want me.
I made a deal with the guy out in the hall.

21:46.105 --> 21:50.064
I said it he took the money, just for one hit,
and gave me the rest...

21:50.242 --> 21:52.267
...I wouldn't sue him.

21:52.912 --> 21:54.471
You knew we all called?

21:54.647 --> 21:56.206
Yes, I knew.

21:56.382 --> 21:57.543
You hate me.

21:57.716 --> 22:00.344
You all hate me. Everybody hates me.

22:02.454 --> 22:08.018
For the first time in my life,
I'm taking advantage of being me.

22:09.595 --> 22:14.157
You allowed yourself to be humiliated
for a few hundred dollars?

22:14.333 --> 22:15.732
Are you crazy?

22:15.901 --> 22:20.065
He'd French kiss a buffalo
for a few hundred dollars.

22:22.708 --> 22:28.147
Now, if you'll excuse me,
there's a suede jacket...

...at Brooks Brothers

and rub the sleeves in your faces.

Well, folks, that is a $400 pie.
might as well eat it while it's still fresh.

Hey, the pie came.
