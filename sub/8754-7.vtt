00:11.427 --> 00:15.769
I think a lot of bad things
happened in the trees.

00:16.708 --> 00:18.266
It's getting more violent.

00:18.268 --> 00:19.874
I've been scratched.

00:19.876 --> 00:21.450
I feel like I'm being watched.

00:21.452 --> 00:23.939
Something's wrong with the kid.

00:23.941 --> 00:26.388
It smells like rotting flesh.

00:26.390 --> 00:29.670
When these people die,
they're stuck with this thing.

00:29.672 --> 00:32.214
She's trying to drive her insane.

00:32.216 --> 00:34.820
Something bad's going to happen.

00:34.822 --> 00:37.330
My name is Amy Allan.

00:37.332 --> 00:39.101
There's panic.

00:39.103 --> 00:40.538
And it's almost like a butchering.

00:40.540 --> 00:41.608
I see dead people.

00:41.610 --> 00:43.747
They all died horribly.

00:43.749 --> 00:45.464
I speak to dead people.

00:45.466 --> 00:46.869
Get out of here.

00:46.871 --> 00:48.508
And they speak to me.

00:48.510 --> 00:50.546
Vicious.

00:50.548 --> 00:53.694
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:53.696 --> 00:55.607
It doesn't matter where you are.
I'll find you.

00:55.609 --> 00:56.879
I rely on my partner.

00:56.881 --> 00:58.149
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

00:58.151 --> 01:00.525
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

01:00.527 --> 01:02.233
This guy's a real piece of work.

01:02.235 --> 01:05.915
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:05.917 --> 01:07.419
I feel like I live in a house of Hell.

01:07.421 --> 01:08.588
It's my job to reveal them.

01:08.590 --> 01:10.094
This is not good.

01:10.096 --> 01:12.605
But Steve and I never speak...

01:12.607 --> 01:14.648
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:14.650 --> 01:16.017
Until the very end...

01:16.019 --> 01:17.823
I want my life back.

01:17.825 --> 01:20.132
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:20.134 --> 01:21.469
Is he trying to kill her?

01:21.471 --> 01:22.806
Or time to get out.

01:22.808 --> 01:24.209
Oh, my God.

01:24.211 --> 01:26.112
This is going to kill us.

01:28.000 --> 01:34.074

01:40.789 --> 01:42.394
I'm down here in Covington,
Louisiana.

01:42.396 --> 01:45.366
It's about 40 miles north of New Orleans.

01:47.203 --> 01:50.511
I received a call from a woman
who was hysterical on the phone.

01:50.513 --> 01:53.715
She said the activity in her
home destroyed her marriage,

01:53.717 --> 01:56.087
and now it's going after her three kids.

01:56.089 --> 01:58.526
When I spoke with her,
she really tugged at my heart,

01:58.528 --> 01:59.961
and I hope we can help her out.

02:03.706 --> 02:07.349
Before Amy arrives,
I have to make sure

02:07.351 --> 02:10.422
the location is free from
any leading information.

02:11.794 --> 02:14.831
Family photos, personal items, and books

02:14.833 --> 02:17.472
have to be covered or removed.

02:17.474 --> 02:18.909
When I'm finished,

02:18.911 --> 02:22.382
the location will be
ready for tonight's walk.

02:31.402 --> 02:33.169
Oh, my God.

02:33.171 --> 02:39.812
The first thing that I got was
really extreme amounts of anger,

02:39.814 --> 02:41.981
like deadly anger.

02:41.983 --> 02:44.354
Uh-oh.

02:47.862 --> 02:53.336
I think a lot of bad things
happened in the trees.

02:53.338 --> 03:01.418
It's very brutal, savage, and dark.

03:10.601 --> 03:12.902
So, Rhonda, I'm glad I'm here.

03:12.904 --> 03:15.608
Listening to you on the
phone broke my heart,

03:15.610 --> 03:16.977
how desperate you are.

03:16.979 --> 03:18.779
It's very stressful here.

03:18.781 --> 03:22.519
Me and my children,
they're terrified, I'm terrified.

03:22.521 --> 03:24.088
And how old are the kids?

03:26.725 --> 03:28.928
This is Scarlett. She's 10.

03:28.930 --> 03:31.765
Gilby, he's 6, and Savannah, she's 8.

03:31.767 --> 03:33.534
Are they being affected?

03:33.536 --> 03:38.209
Yes, I think Scarlett's probably
had the most experiences.

03:38.211 --> 03:40.478
What have you experienced?

03:40.480 --> 03:44.115
We're hearing a lot of footsteps, voices.

03:44.117 --> 03:49.854
We're seeing shadows,
and now it's getting more violent.

03:49.856 --> 03:51.523
How long have you been in the house?

03:51.525 --> 03:52.657
December of '04.

03:52.659 --> 03:54.795
My ex-husband and I custom-built the house.

03:54.797 --> 03:56.430
- Your ex-husband?
- Yes.

03:56.432 --> 03:58.864
Okay. Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

03:58.866 --> 04:01.199
Definitely think some of
the activity in this house

04:01.201 --> 04:02.869
contributed to our divorce.

04:02.871 --> 04:04.005
Why do you say that?

04:04.007 --> 04:07.139
We were very much in love, very happy.

04:07.141 --> 04:08.906
He was my soul mate.

04:08.908 --> 04:12.273
And he was just never his regular self

04:12.275 --> 04:13.975
after we moved here.

04:13.977 --> 04:16.144
You saw a personality change?

04:16.146 --> 04:19.980
Yes. And there was just other issues,
like substance abuse.

04:19.982 --> 04:22.548
He was addicted to pain medication.

04:22.550 --> 04:25.017
Geez. After moving here?

04:25.019 --> 04:26.750
After moving here.

04:26.752 --> 04:28.850
I don't mean to get nosy. I just...

04:28.852 --> 04:31.985
The more I know,
the more I can convey to Amy.

04:31.987 --> 04:33.421
Mm-hmm.

04:33.423 --> 04:36.456
So you feel your husband's
personality and the mood swings

04:36.458 --> 04:39.694
changed when he moved here with you?

04:39.696 --> 04:40.795
What about yourself?

04:40.797 --> 04:42.796
I definitely noticed it with myself, too.

04:42.798 --> 04:44.862
Could be angry really easy.

04:44.864 --> 04:46.698
I'm in pain a lot.

04:46.700 --> 04:48.366
I started having health problems

04:48.368 --> 04:50.402
the day after we bought the property.

04:50.404 --> 04:55.435
It's a burning in my legs and feet,
and it's all the time.

04:55.437 --> 04:58.772
And I've been to over 40 specialists.

05:00.074 --> 05:02.043
They still don't know what's wrong with me

05:02.045 --> 05:04.175
- or why it happened.
- Let me ask you a question.

05:04.177 --> 05:06.309
As far as the investigation goes,

05:06.311 --> 05:08.678
what are you hoping to get out of it?

05:08.680 --> 05:13.313
I would hope that my children
and I could not be afraid,

05:13.315 --> 05:14.747
have a normal childhood.

05:14.749 --> 05:17.080
They shouldn't have to
live in fear like this.

05:22.919 --> 05:25.888
This is, like, ridiculously painful.

05:25.890 --> 05:31.653
The energy here is so
bad that it could...

05:31.655 --> 05:33.924
Harm a sensitive.

05:36.391 --> 05:37.992
It's strange

05:37.994 --> 05:44.027
because it is composed of
not just the dead energy here

05:44.029 --> 05:45.696
but also the living.

05:45.698 --> 05:48.330
And they are absorbing this.

05:48.332 --> 05:53.469
That's caused an illness,
I think, for the female here.

05:56.770 --> 05:59.740
I don't know if it's
heart or if it's blood,

05:59.742 --> 06:03.273
but there's something
physical that's manifested

06:03.275 --> 06:04.808
as a result of this.

06:04.810 --> 06:07.612
I see, like, restlessness.

06:07.614 --> 06:11.947
I see panic. I see series of illnesses.

06:11.949 --> 06:15.085
So this is something going on.

06:18.853 --> 06:22.489
This has, like,
incapacitated this person at times.

06:22.491 --> 06:25.057
I think there's been hospital visits.

06:25.059 --> 06:27.295
And I'm, like, seeing this conversation,

06:27.297 --> 06:29.364
and there's a male.

06:29.366 --> 06:32.601
And he's just like, "Why don't"...

06:33.870 --> 06:36.806
Like, "Why don't we just leave?"

06:39.246 --> 06:41.814
God, I feel so sick.

06:46.220 --> 06:48.955
So, what's going on up here?

06:48.957 --> 06:51.258
I've been slapped up here.

06:51.260 --> 06:52.858
You've been slapped?

06:52.860 --> 06:54.424
- Yes.
- How?

06:54.426 --> 06:57.528
I was over here, putting some things away,

06:57.530 --> 07:00.966
and it felt like someone
slapped me on my butt.

07:00.968 --> 07:03.167
Did something fall on you maybe?

07:03.169 --> 07:05.836
No, nothing fell on me. Felt like a hand.

07:05.838 --> 07:08.739
Okay. But did you look to see if any
of the kids were up here or anything?

07:08.741 --> 07:10.108
Yeah, they were downstairs.

07:10.110 --> 07:12.777
Any other physical things
happen to you up here?

07:12.779 --> 07:14.612
Yes. This just happened recently.

07:14.614 --> 07:17.047
I had three scratches
just appear on my arm.

07:17.049 --> 07:18.782
Kind of looks like cat scratches, you know?

07:18.784 --> 07:19.849
It's not.

07:19.851 --> 07:22.485
The cat that sleeps with us is declawed.

07:22.487 --> 07:24.955
They're still showing up here.

07:24.957 --> 07:26.656
Oh, yeah. I can see it.

07:26.658 --> 07:29.660
What about the kids?
Any experiences with them?

07:29.662 --> 07:31.562
Yes, all of my children
have had similar attacks.

07:31.564 --> 07:33.296
Okay.

07:38.434 --> 07:40.603
Oh, God.

07:40.605 --> 07:44.442
There's this old woman up here.

07:44.444 --> 07:49.113
She is very grumpy.

07:50.514 --> 07:52.581
Whoo! Ooh!

07:52.583 --> 07:54.283
Whoo!

07:54.285 --> 07:56.419
Talk about some [bleep] anger issues.

07:57.823 --> 08:00.324
She hates the living people.

08:00.326 --> 08:04.291
She just says, "I haunt them.
That's what I do."

08:04.293 --> 08:07.596
And she says she does it very well.

08:07.598 --> 08:12.604
I think this old woman is
focused on an adult female here.

08:12.606 --> 08:16.708
I'm thinking she's trying
to drive her insane.

08:20.544 --> 08:22.877
All right.
So, what's going on in the bedroom,

08:22.879 --> 08:24.878
as far as experiences go?

08:24.880 --> 08:27.884
One night, I was touched a lot.

08:27.886 --> 08:30.954
My head, my face, my hair was touched.

08:30.956 --> 08:33.323
And then I felt someone
come on the foot of the bed

08:33.326 --> 08:35.126
and, like, sit next to me like this,

08:35.128 --> 08:38.528
and the bed went down,
and it didn't get back up.

08:38.530 --> 08:40.299
It just stayed like this.

08:40.301 --> 08:42.068
- It feel like a person?
- Yes.

08:42.071 --> 08:44.105
It felt like a person
was getting in the bed.

08:44.107 --> 08:45.671
How big of a person?

08:45.673 --> 08:47.507
It felt like someone my size.

08:47.509 --> 08:48.875
I mean, this is crazy.

08:48.877 --> 08:50.276
This is what I'm used to.

08:50.278 --> 08:51.778
Unless you live it every day,

08:51.780 --> 08:54.381
people just don't understand
what you go through.

09:00.855 --> 09:05.395
There have been times that the old woman

09:05.397 --> 09:09.228
has beat on the living woman here.

09:14.466 --> 09:17.368
I see her standing next to a bed.

09:17.370 --> 09:20.235
And the old woman is very big

09:20.237 --> 09:24.341
and literally just sits on her body.

09:24.343 --> 09:29.279
And the woman's huge,
so it's like smushing the living woman.

09:32.881 --> 09:35.119
She's trying to drive her crazy,

09:35.121 --> 09:40.392
hoping that she's gonna lose
her [bleep] mind, basically.

10:00.212 --> 10:02.548
How long did you live
here before you got divorced?

10:02.550 --> 10:03.816
About seven years.

10:03.818 --> 10:05.617
So, Scott,
the seven years you were living here,

10:05.619 --> 10:07.618
did you ever experience
anything you couldn't explain?

10:07.620 --> 10:08.787
You know, like the smells

10:08.789 --> 10:11.024
that would just constantly
come from that room...

10:11.026 --> 10:12.792
The same smells, like rotting flesh.

10:12.794 --> 10:13.793
Which room are we talking about?

10:13.795 --> 10:14.828
The playroom.

10:14.830 --> 10:17.330
Did you ever investigate it?

10:17.332 --> 10:18.867
Oh, yeah.

10:18.869 --> 10:20.802
The drywall was, you know, dry.

10:20.804 --> 10:23.104
I mean, it wasn't wet.
There was no moisture anywhere.

10:23.106 --> 10:25.607
So, there was no indication of
a decaying body or anything?

10:25.609 --> 10:27.541
- None.
- Anything else?

10:27.543 --> 10:29.141
No. I'm here for Rhonda

10:29.143 --> 10:31.176
because I know how much
this is affecting her.

10:31.178 --> 10:33.213
Whether I'm a true believer or not, I mean,

10:33.215 --> 10:36.351
I have to take care of my
kids and her, as well.

10:36.353 --> 10:38.584
You realize they're getting scratched?

10:38.586 --> 10:40.587
She told me about that.
She showed me some of the marks.

10:40.589 --> 10:42.222
Yeah, I mean, that's got to drive you crazy.

10:42.224 --> 10:43.522
It's horrible.

10:43.524 --> 10:46.325
I mean, how do you protect your
child when that's going on?

10:46.327 --> 10:48.028
They shouldn't have to
kind of go through this.

10:48.030 --> 10:49.998
So, when I was talking to Rhonda,

10:50.000 --> 10:51.667
she basically said you
guys were soul mates.

10:51.669 --> 10:53.000
Do you agree with that?

10:53.002 --> 10:55.236
Oh, yeah. I have no doubt about that.

10:55.238 --> 10:57.774
We felt like we were doing
everything the right way,

10:57.776 --> 10:59.642
and then we moved in this house.

10:59.644 --> 11:01.343
Things just started changing.

11:01.345 --> 11:03.512
And the whole seven years I was here,

11:03.514 --> 11:06.184
I was just more unhappy than
I've ever been in my life.

11:06.186 --> 11:09.053
My behavior started becoming more...

11:09.055 --> 11:11.089
little bit more aggressive.

11:11.091 --> 11:13.123
So, you think you've changed
since you've been out of here?

11:13.125 --> 11:14.624
It's a weird thing you would say that.

11:14.626 --> 11:16.694
I don't think I've ever been
happier in my entire life.

11:20.131 --> 11:24.664
There's this living male,
and he's just had it,

11:24.666 --> 11:28.901
and he's very overly dramatic

11:28.903 --> 11:31.640
and just, like, screaming at everyone.

11:34.411 --> 11:36.980
He's just not reacting well, I think,

11:36.982 --> 11:38.815
to everything that's going on, I guess.

11:38.817 --> 11:40.680
He wants out.

11:40.682 --> 11:44.787
He wants away from these people,
the living people.

11:44.789 --> 11:47.556
I don't know why this
living man is flipping out,

11:47.558 --> 11:50.392
but it has something to
do with the trees outside.

11:51.796 --> 11:56.397
There's a male in this,
like, tree house thing.

11:57.966 --> 12:01.803
There's some connection
between this dead man

12:01.805 --> 12:04.838
and the living male at this place.

12:04.840 --> 12:07.140
They have things in common.

12:07.142 --> 12:10.546
I can't... can't keep talking to you

12:10.548 --> 12:15.618
if this is gonna keep being in the way.

12:17.724 --> 12:19.858
He likes this relationship

12:19.860 --> 12:23.196
'cause he's felt lonely for a long time,

12:23.198 --> 12:28.605
and he feels like this is
a kindred spirit for him.

12:35.511 --> 12:37.433
- How old are you?
- 8.

12:37.533 --> 12:38.609
8 years old.

12:38.709 --> 12:41.376
Now, is this the room that you sleep in?

12:41.378 --> 12:42.811
I would, but I don't.

12:42.813 --> 12:45.450
You don't, huh? Where are you sleeping?

12:45.452 --> 12:47.553
With my mom and my sister and my brother.

12:47.555 --> 12:50.189
Okay. Why are you sleeping with mommy?

12:50.191 --> 12:52.391
Because I don't want to sleep in my room

12:52.393 --> 12:54.494
because I feel like I'm being watched.

12:54.496 --> 12:57.296
Who do you think is watching you, honey?

12:57.298 --> 12:58.797
I know it's not good.

12:58.799 --> 13:01.234
Have you ever seen
anything or heard anything?

13:01.236 --> 13:04.171
I saw a back of a lady's head in a bun.

13:04.173 --> 13:07.208
Okay. Where did you see this lady's head?

13:07.210 --> 13:09.377
In the kitchen, on a chair.

13:09.379 --> 13:10.778
- In the kitchen?
- Yeah.

13:10.780 --> 13:11.779
Okay.

13:11.781 --> 13:13.046
Are you afraid of the house, honey?

13:13.048 --> 13:14.180
Yeah.

13:14.182 --> 13:15.914
Any place you don't like being alone in?

13:15.916 --> 13:17.983
All of the places.

13:21.521 --> 13:24.490
There's something here.
There's something...

13:24.492 --> 13:26.425
There's something here.

13:28.595 --> 13:31.027
Something's wrong with the kid.

13:31.029 --> 13:34.064
Something's really wrong with her.

13:34.066 --> 13:36.200
Mm.

13:36.202 --> 13:39.900
Something... Something is inside the child.

13:43.137 --> 13:45.035
I think it looks like a woman to her.

13:45.037 --> 13:47.037
I saw something on the floor,

13:47.039 --> 13:49.739
something like it crawled in
on the floor or something.

13:49.741 --> 13:51.175
Then I, like, see this woman,

13:51.177 --> 13:53.675
so I don't know if she
thinks it's a woman or not.

13:53.677 --> 13:55.577
Sometimes she plays with it.

13:55.579 --> 13:57.346
There's always somebody in the room,

13:57.348 --> 13:59.513
and they're always talking,
and it's not good.

13:59.515 --> 14:01.713
I don't know what this thing is.

14:01.715 --> 14:04.180
I think it wants to take the kid.

14:11.221 --> 14:13.623
So, Scarlett, I was talking to Mommy,

14:13.625 --> 14:17.328
and she told me you were having
some experiences in the house.

14:17.330 --> 14:18.628
- How old are you?
- 10.

14:18.630 --> 14:20.563
Okay. And you're the oldest, right?

14:20.565 --> 14:21.999
Yes.

14:22.001 --> 14:24.169
You guys are going through a lot here, huh?

14:24.171 --> 14:26.271
I've been touched and scratched.

14:26.273 --> 14:29.944
I've been, like, grabbed.

14:29.946 --> 14:32.978
I feel like fingers are just touching me.

14:32.980 --> 14:34.881
Now, you said you get scratched.

14:34.883 --> 14:37.552
How does that happen? What goes on?

14:37.554 --> 14:39.686
It feels like somebody's scratching me,

14:39.688 --> 14:43.090
and it burns really bad for,
like, a long time.

14:43.092 --> 14:44.525
Maybe a minute later, I'll look down,

14:44.527 --> 14:45.960
there's a giant scratch right there.

14:47.493 --> 14:49.357
Has anything else happened in here?

14:49.359 --> 14:50.958
I see apparitions.

14:50.960 --> 14:52.793
Okay. Of what?

14:52.795 --> 14:55.294
I've seen one of a girl.

14:55.296 --> 14:58.130
She's wearing a long,
long, like, pink dress.

14:58.132 --> 14:59.798
What... Did it look like it was old?

14:59.800 --> 15:02.498
Like, old times, or does it look
like it was from recent times?

15:02.500 --> 15:04.396
It looked like it was from old times.

15:04.398 --> 15:06.266
Okay.

15:06.268 --> 15:09.001
And I've seen, like, creatures in here.

15:09.003 --> 15:10.871
What kind of creatures?

15:10.873 --> 15:12.840
They look like people,

15:12.842 --> 15:17.241
but they're, like,
all crouched down and scaly.

15:17.243 --> 15:20.215
It looks a little bit more
like an alien or something.

15:20.217 --> 15:21.482
What are they doing?

15:21.484 --> 15:23.654
They're just staring at me.

15:23.656 --> 15:25.491
I can tell by the look on your face,

15:25.493 --> 15:27.594
you're really afraid of these things, huh?

15:30.497 --> 15:32.798
Can you describe this thing now?

15:32.800 --> 15:36.500
It can look, like, humanoid,

15:36.502 --> 15:39.441
but it can also look like an animal.

15:39.443 --> 15:41.309
It can change its height.

15:41.311 --> 15:43.577
It can be standing on two feet,

15:43.579 --> 15:47.647
or it can be like an animal, on all fours.

15:47.649 --> 15:51.916
Always pitch-black,
and it does always have wings.

15:51.918 --> 15:54.221
So, what would you call this?

15:54.223 --> 15:57.157
Most people would call it, like, a demon,

15:57.159 --> 16:00.792
but it's not... not a demon.

16:00.794 --> 16:03.029
I think it's scarier.

16:03.031 --> 16:09.902
I'm very confused how it's
associated or around a child.

16:13.970 --> 16:18.272
And they can attach to people...
living people.

16:18.274 --> 16:22.541
Like people who are
alcoholics or drug addicts.

16:22.543 --> 16:24.143
They attach, typically,

16:24.145 --> 16:26.246
to somebody who's in the throes of it.

16:26.248 --> 16:29.214
When these people die,

16:29.216 --> 16:32.783
they're stuck with this thing for,
like, eternity.

16:32.785 --> 16:38.420
I've seen, like,
the dead people with these things,

16:38.422 --> 16:43.558
and they look like
they're suffering greatly.

16:43.560 --> 16:47.597
Like, they seriously, like,
better do what I say,

16:47.599 --> 16:50.199
or people are gonna [bleep] die.

16:50.201 --> 16:51.201
Period.

17:04.864 --> 17:06.996
Even though Rhonda's house is new,

17:06.998 --> 17:09.531
the property deeds go
back to the mid 1800s.

17:09.534 --> 17:12.037
I'm on my way to meet
with a local historian

17:12.039 --> 17:14.374
who said one of the
original owners of the land

17:14.376 --> 17:16.976
suffered heartbreak, insanity, and death.

17:24.513 --> 17:26.248
So, Mary, you mentioned on the phone

17:26.250 --> 17:28.779
that the original owners of
the property I'm investigating

17:28.781 --> 17:30.981
had a pretty tough time there,
a lot of tragedy.

17:30.983 --> 17:32.746
Right. But before we get to that,

17:32.748 --> 17:34.413
how did they even come to the property?

17:34.415 --> 17:37.716
Well, Frances Bossier inherited
about 100 acres of property

17:37.718 --> 17:41.352
from her deceased grandmother
in the Covington area,

17:41.354 --> 17:44.654
which is where your
client's house is located.

17:44.656 --> 17:47.457
This is the land patent,
showing her receiving the property.

17:48.493 --> 17:51.460
Okay. Now, who'd she come here with?

17:51.462 --> 17:54.530
She came here with her husband, Joseph.

17:54.532 --> 17:57.001
So I've got to assume back in the 1850s,
at some point,

17:57.003 --> 17:59.738
the husband would've got the
property turned over to his name.

17:59.740 --> 18:02.575
Correct.
She did turn over her assets to him.

18:03.577 --> 18:05.776
But she thought that he
was being very reckless

18:05.778 --> 18:06.777
with his investments,

18:06.779 --> 18:08.814
so she actually sued him

18:08.816 --> 18:12.386
to gain control of her property and funds.

18:12.388 --> 18:15.456
We've actually been able to
find copies of the lawsuit.

18:15.458 --> 18:17.891
Okay, so what happens?

18:17.893 --> 18:19.492
Well, she actually won,

18:19.494 --> 18:22.532
and he had to pay her her money back,

18:22.534 --> 18:24.766
and she maintained control
of all of her property,

18:24.768 --> 18:27.300
which was unheard of for that time period.

18:27.302 --> 18:28.800
But he must have been very reckless.

18:28.802 --> 18:30.935
Okay. So they were married when
they went to court on this.

18:30.937 --> 18:32.269
Did it break them up after that?

18:32.271 --> 18:34.302
No, it didn't.

18:34.304 --> 18:35.904
Okay. Now, you mentioned on the phone

18:35.906 --> 18:37.706
there was a lot of tragedy
with this family.

18:37.708 --> 18:39.474
And I'm assuming it wasn't the court case.

18:39.476 --> 18:42.910
No, unfortunately, in 1853,
their oldest daughter, Fanny,

18:42.912 --> 18:46.315
drowned in an accident right
here in Lake Pontchartrain.

18:47.719 --> 18:49.985
So I would assume,
between the court case against each other

18:49.987 --> 18:52.320
and now they lose a kid,
it had to be tough on their marriage.

18:52.322 --> 18:53.723
Of course.

18:53.725 --> 18:55.192
Okay.

18:56.693 --> 18:59.762
The old woman who beats
on the living woman here,

18:59.764 --> 19:00.896
this is her house.

19:00.898 --> 19:02.664
She wants the house back.

19:02.666 --> 19:05.131
She doesn't want the living here.

19:05.133 --> 19:06.832
I think she was wealthy.

19:06.834 --> 19:11.472
What I see from her past is
a very dysfunctional family.

19:13.944 --> 19:16.280
I don't think she had a very good life.

19:18.481 --> 19:21.152
So somebody was tugging on me.

19:21.154 --> 19:23.753
Okay. She's a little kid.

19:23.755 --> 19:29.927
Kind of feel like she might have drowned...

19:32.096 --> 19:34.265
but, like, in an outside water,

19:34.267 --> 19:40.738
like, in, like,
a creek or lake or something.

19:40.740 --> 19:43.174
You aren't kidding when you said

19:43.176 --> 19:45.744
there was tragedy with this family.

19:45.746 --> 19:47.413
Right, and, actually, that's not it.

19:47.415 --> 19:48.514
There was something else.

19:48.516 --> 19:51.217
In 1859, Joseph Bossier got involved

19:51.219 --> 19:54.121
with a man named J.M. Vernon.

19:54.123 --> 19:56.620
And he was his business partner,

19:56.622 --> 19:59.891
and, like all of Bossier's
business dealings, it went sour.

20:01.494 --> 20:03.628
J.M. Vernon was a newspaper editor,

20:03.630 --> 20:05.063
so to get Bossier back,

20:05.065 --> 20:08.236
he actually wrote some nasty
things about him in the paper.

20:08.238 --> 20:11.372
Okay. So, what does this guy
Bossier do about this slander?

20:11.374 --> 20:13.774
Well, he actually went to find Vernon

20:13.776 --> 20:15.479
in a New Orleans courthouse.

20:15.481 --> 20:17.883
Okay. And he brought a gun,

20:17.885 --> 20:21.086
and he drew his gun,
but Vernon was a faster draw.

20:21.088 --> 20:23.956
Vernon shot Bossier four times

20:23.958 --> 20:27.127
in the hands, face, ribs, and mouth.

20:27.129 --> 20:29.930
Okay. Does he die?

20:29.932 --> 20:32.698
12 days later, he died,
leaving Frances a widow.

20:32.700 --> 20:34.734
Huh.

20:36.804 --> 20:39.072
This guy who hangs out in this tree

20:39.074 --> 20:42.140
[bleep] there's a really bad
pain associated with him.

20:42.142 --> 20:45.643
And then I am feeling like
something hit me here.

20:45.645 --> 20:47.910
I got to just kind of let this go

20:47.912 --> 20:50.944
'cause it's really kind of
messing me up a little bit.

20:52.115 --> 20:54.918
I'm trying to learn more
about the man in the tree

20:54.920 --> 20:57.888
who's attached himself to
a living male in the house,

20:57.890 --> 21:01.160
but all I'm getting is intense
pain in the back of my head.

21:01.162 --> 21:04.733
And then I hear a gunshot
right next to my ear,

21:04.735 --> 21:06.836
and that's how he died.

21:08.505 --> 21:10.405
I don't know if it's self-inflicted

21:10.407 --> 21:11.906
or if he was shot in the head.

21:11.908 --> 21:13.475
God [bleep]

21:13.477 --> 21:15.247
This [bleep] hurts.

21:15.249 --> 21:17.517
I can't even concentrate.

21:33.899 --> 21:37.011
This guy Joseph Bossier
sounds like a real loose cannon,

21:37.111 --> 21:39.243
and I want to know if
there's more to his story.

21:39.245 --> 21:40.944
But I've actually managed

21:41.044 --> 21:43.113
to track down one of his descendants

21:43.115 --> 21:45.780
who says his life was so wild,
it could be made into a movie.

21:54.958 --> 21:56.990
So, Rene, the reason I contacted you

21:56.992 --> 21:58.890
was I did an interview about
the first owners of the property

21:58.892 --> 22:01.292
I'm investigating,
and Joseph Bossier came up.

22:01.294 --> 22:02.960
Now, you're related to him.

22:02.962 --> 22:04.430
I am.

22:04.432 --> 22:05.863
I am his fifth great-granddaughter.

22:05.865 --> 22:07.997
- This is him?
- That's him.

22:07.999 --> 22:11.268
So eventually he winds up with
the property I'm investigating.

22:11.270 --> 22:13.003
But before that, what do you know about him?

22:13.005 --> 22:16.142
Well, he was in the Navy when he was 11.

22:16.144 --> 22:18.280
He got kicked out because
he stole something.

22:18.282 --> 22:21.184
Then he was in the Army when he turned 12.

22:21.186 --> 22:23.482
I don't know why he was
discharged from the Army

22:23.484 --> 22:25.084
- at age 12.
- Okay.

22:25.086 --> 22:28.055
Then he became a mercenary for
several different countries...

22:28.057 --> 22:30.556
France, Russia, Spain, Britain, Egypt.

22:30.558 --> 22:31.957
Wow.

22:31.959 --> 22:34.893
I bet even his time overseas
wasn't gonna be a quiet one.

22:34.895 --> 22:37.029
No. In the British Navy, as a mercenary,

22:37.031 --> 22:39.365
he was accused of drowning a crew member.

22:39.367 --> 22:42.132
Then he built a ship.

22:42.134 --> 22:43.334
- He did?
- Yeah.

22:43.336 --> 22:45.038
He played pirate.

22:45.040 --> 22:46.538
Pirate?

22:46.540 --> 22:47.839
Where did he do that?

22:47.841 --> 22:49.474
Right out here in New Orleans.

22:49.476 --> 22:51.510
When you say he played pirate,
did he actually rob people?

22:51.512 --> 22:52.579
No.

22:52.581 --> 22:55.284
He would see other ships out in the Gulf,

22:55.286 --> 22:57.654
and he would know that
they were his friends.

22:57.656 --> 22:58.788
Okay.

22:58.790 --> 23:00.356
So he would raise the skull and crossbones,

23:00.358 --> 23:01.890
and he would board their ship.

23:01.892 --> 23:03.928
So, he was just out in
the water, playing...

23:03.930 --> 23:05.561
Except for one time.

23:05.563 --> 23:06.895
What happened?

23:06.897 --> 23:10.666
Well, he thought it was his
friend when he boarded the ship,

23:10.668 --> 23:12.367
but it wasn't who he thought it was.

23:12.369 --> 23:14.536
Him and his crew member got beaten

23:14.538 --> 23:17.039
within an inch of their life.

23:17.041 --> 23:18.273
Wow.

23:18.275 --> 23:20.174
- Does he ever get charged with anything?
- No.

23:20.176 --> 23:22.476
He ends up suing the captain

23:22.478 --> 23:24.177
for damages to his health and reputation.

23:24.179 --> 23:25.579
Okay.

23:25.581 --> 23:28.215
This guy was really something else.

23:33.188 --> 23:37.022
There's something with military here.

23:37.024 --> 23:39.593
Something.

23:43.330 --> 23:45.730
This guy who hangs out in a tree,

23:45.732 --> 23:49.200
he was in the military.

23:49.202 --> 23:52.271
Yeah. He got twisted in the head.

23:52.273 --> 23:55.605
Yeah, he did. He got real [bleep] up.

23:55.607 --> 23:59.176
He's saying to me that, you know,

23:59.178 --> 24:06.250
a lot of things that he
did was due to his head,

24:06.252 --> 24:11.355
being, you know, messed up.

24:11.357 --> 24:15.696
Do you know when this is from?

24:15.698 --> 24:17.500
This is...

24:23.210 --> 24:26.678
You know, he's not denying that
a part of him didn't like it.

24:26.680 --> 24:29.014
You know, a part of him liked it,

24:29.016 --> 24:30.914
but he's saying,

24:30.916 --> 24:36.318
"I saw a lot of horrible things,
and it ruined me.

24:36.320 --> 24:39.183
It ruined me."

24:42.485 --> 24:45.221
So far, I know the original
owner of my client's land

24:45.223 --> 24:48.357
was a reckless mercenary
who wound up murdered.

24:49.659 --> 24:52.957
But I need to see if there's anything
else that could help my case.

24:52.959 --> 24:56.095
Searching through old records,

24:56.097 --> 24:59.335
I find a man named Frank Lenel,
who killed himself.

24:59.337 --> 25:03.239
But the reasons are unclear.

25:03.241 --> 25:06.278
So I've asked a local
archivist to meet me here.

25:06.280 --> 25:09.882
He says the tragedies this man
suffered could help my case.

25:14.056 --> 25:15.523
So, Bill,
I found that article about this guy Lenel

25:15.525 --> 25:16.858
that killed himself.

25:16.860 --> 25:19.064
Do you know how he came
about being on the property?

25:19.066 --> 25:23.403
Frank married Louisa Schultz in 1858.

25:23.405 --> 25:25.538
And a year later, her father died,

25:25.540 --> 25:28.376
and she inherited hundreds
of acres of property.

25:28.378 --> 25:29.813
And the house was on that property.

25:29.815 --> 25:31.481
Okay. So, now, the article said it was 1880

25:31.483 --> 25:32.748
when he killed himself.

25:32.750 --> 25:34.916
So, what happens before that? I mean...

25:34.918 --> 25:37.020
He and Louisa had about six children,

25:37.022 --> 25:40.723
and then, unfortunately, in 1871, she died.

25:40.725 --> 25:42.561
She was 36 years old.

25:42.563 --> 25:44.329
Okay. So she's young when she died.

25:44.331 --> 25:45.796
Do we know what she died of?

25:45.798 --> 25:47.530
No, we weren't able to find that.

25:47.532 --> 25:49.231
Then, the next year,

25:49.233 --> 25:52.503
he remarries a woman by the
name of Elizabeth Davis.

25:52.505 --> 25:55.038
That was in 1872.

25:55.040 --> 25:57.941
The area was building up quite a bit.

25:57.943 --> 26:01.747
And because of the trains coming
in and the population expansion,

26:01.749 --> 26:04.983
he decided, as an entrepreneur,
to open a hotel,

26:04.985 --> 26:07.118
which he was able to do in 1880.

26:07.120 --> 26:08.817
That's the same year he kills himself.

26:08.819 --> 26:10.318
Correct.

26:10.320 --> 26:12.553
Now, you would think opening up
a hotel would be a good thing.

26:12.555 --> 26:13.621
You would think so,

26:13.623 --> 26:15.890
but three months before he opened the hotel,

26:15.892 --> 26:18.326
his second wife died of unknown causes.

26:18.328 --> 26:19.761
She was 43 years old.

26:19.763 --> 26:20.997
Wow.

26:20.999 --> 26:23.067
Did he live long enough
to see the hotel open?

26:23.069 --> 26:26.172
Well, he did open the hotel successfully,

26:26.174 --> 26:28.173
and it was a month later
that he killed himself.

26:28.175 --> 26:31.110
In fact, he was found in the woods

26:31.112 --> 26:34.414
about a mile and a quarter from the hotel.

26:34.416 --> 26:37.253
And at the coroner's inquest,
they determined

26:37.255 --> 26:41.094
that he had shot himself with
a pistol through the chin,

26:41.096 --> 26:42.261
into the brain.

26:42.263 --> 26:43.864
Okay.

26:50.340 --> 26:53.472
During my walk,
I saw a dead man in the trees.

26:53.474 --> 26:55.441
I'm meeting with a sketch artist

26:55.443 --> 26:57.743
to draw him as he appeared in life.

26:57.745 --> 27:00.378
He was in his 40s.

27:00.380 --> 27:03.812
He mouth is kind of feminine-looking,

27:03.814 --> 27:06.984
and his hair is slicked back.

27:06.986 --> 27:09.284
Next, I describe the disturbing scene

27:09.286 --> 27:11.519
I witnessed in a little girl's room.

27:11.521 --> 27:14.389
There was a dead woman.

27:14.391 --> 27:18.760
And behind the child, there was this thing.

27:18.762 --> 27:24.000
And it has wings, like,
almost encasing his body.

27:29.773 --> 27:32.342
Amy, is this what you saw?

27:34.913 --> 27:36.214
Yes, that's what I saw.

27:57.263 --> 28:00.229
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

28:00.231 --> 28:02.698
we're ready to reveal our
findings to each other

28:02.700 --> 28:05.203
and our clients for the first time.

28:05.205 --> 28:08.738
Now, Amy,
I want you to meet Rhonda and Scott.

28:08.740 --> 28:13.310
Rhonda lives in the house with
her three beautiful young kids.

28:13.312 --> 28:18.342
Scott is their father
and Rhonda's ex-husband.

28:18.344 --> 28:20.543
He lived in the house for a while,

28:20.545 --> 28:22.947
and you've been out for
about three years now?

28:22.949 --> 28:24.916
But he's a skeptic,
and Rhonda wanted him here

28:24.918 --> 28:27.150
just so he could know the
hell that she's going through

28:27.152 --> 28:28.683
with the kids.

28:28.685 --> 28:31.551
Now, you asked me to not
hold the reveal in the house.

28:31.553 --> 28:33.752
And that's the first time
you've ever done that,

28:33.754 --> 28:35.485
so I'm curious as to why.

28:35.487 --> 28:39.750
Well, there's a lot going on there.

28:39.752 --> 28:45.616
And I personally felt that
I was physically in danger.

28:47.716 --> 28:50.754
During my walk, there was this man

28:50.756 --> 28:55.292
who was up in a tree,

28:55.294 --> 29:00.496
and what he was doing,
basically, was watching people.

29:00.498 --> 29:01.965
It was disturbing.

29:03.367 --> 29:05.870
He was saying that he had attached himself

29:05.872 --> 29:08.174
to a male in the house,

29:08.176 --> 29:13.380
that he felt like this person
was a kindred spirit to him

29:13.382 --> 29:15.417
and that he really enjoyed this

29:15.419 --> 29:17.888
because he had been lonely for so long.

29:17.890 --> 29:20.826
Now, these guys built the house in 2004,

29:20.828 --> 29:23.465
and Scott's the only guy
that lived in the house.

29:23.467 --> 29:24.466
Mm-hmm.

29:24.468 --> 29:25.866
Now, I got to ask you a question.

29:25.868 --> 29:29.036
If this guy attached himself to Scott,
let's say,

29:29.038 --> 29:31.135
would it change his behavior?

29:31.137 --> 29:32.869
It's possible.

29:32.871 --> 29:35.632
The whole time
we were living there,

29:35.634 --> 29:37.598
everything about his
personality was different.

29:37.600 --> 29:40.866
And so was it anger?

29:40.868 --> 29:43.436
Yes, with everybody.

29:43.438 --> 29:45.905
My personality did
change while in the house,

29:45.907 --> 29:47.873
and particularly toward the end there,

29:47.875 --> 29:49.874
I mean, I was getting really aggressive.

29:49.876 --> 29:52.740
And I think that contributed to,
probably, the final breakup.

29:54.946 --> 29:56.581
Now, did you get anything about this guy,

29:56.583 --> 29:58.650
who he might have been when he was alive?

29:58.652 --> 30:01.084
What I was able to get from this individual

30:01.086 --> 30:03.018
was something about the military.

30:03.020 --> 30:05.256
I believe he was in the military.

30:05.258 --> 30:09.594
And what he said was that when
he went into the military,

30:09.596 --> 30:12.965
he saw a lot of things that disturbed him.

30:12.967 --> 30:15.833
So he admits that he got a
little messed up in the head

30:15.835 --> 30:18.502
from this whole experience.

30:18.504 --> 30:22.140
Then I heard the gunshot by my ear

30:22.142 --> 30:24.842
and was obviously feeling this pain.

30:24.844 --> 30:29.679
What he looked like, in his death state,

30:29.681 --> 30:32.053
was a disaster.

30:32.055 --> 30:34.153
There was a couple guys on your property,

30:34.155 --> 30:38.089
going back with the history,
that died from gunshot wounds.

30:38.091 --> 30:40.359
There's one guy in particular,

30:40.361 --> 30:41.829
what she's describing makes me think of.

30:41.831 --> 30:45.001
His name was Joseph Bossier and his wife,
Frances,

30:45.003 --> 30:46.769
were the two first recorded
owners of the property

30:46.771 --> 30:48.336
you guys live on.

30:48.338 --> 30:50.272
You mentioned this guy was in the military,
right?

30:50.274 --> 30:51.641
- Yeah.
- Okay.

30:51.643 --> 30:54.342
So now, in 1814, at the age of 11,
he joins the Navy.

30:54.344 --> 30:55.778
Geez.

30:55.780 --> 30:57.379
But he was discharged for theft.

30:57.381 --> 30:59.713
1815, he joins the Army.

30:59.715 --> 31:03.280
This time,
he was discharged for unknown reasons.

31:03.282 --> 31:05.247
His involvement in the
military doesn't stop there.

31:05.249 --> 31:09.720
Between the years of 1816 and 1823,

31:09.722 --> 31:13.123
he served as a mercenary in
five different navies in Europe.

31:13.125 --> 31:14.391
- No way.
- Yeah.

31:14.393 --> 31:17.959
He served in France, Egypt,
Russia, Britain, and Spain.

31:17.961 --> 31:20.760
Now, he got thrown out of the British Navy

31:20.762 --> 31:24.329
because he was accused of
drowning another crew member.

31:24.331 --> 31:27.698
Now, you said this guy
died from a gunshot wound.

31:27.700 --> 31:30.637
In 1859, Bossier gets into a nasty dispute

31:30.639 --> 31:34.871
with a business partner of his,
who was a guy named J.M. Vernon.

31:34.873 --> 31:36.506
He was also a newspaper editor.

31:36.508 --> 31:39.677
Now, Vernon printed some pretty nasty,
disparaging things

31:39.679 --> 31:41.178
about Bossier,

31:41.180 --> 31:44.682
so Bossier found out that he was
gonna be at a courthouse one day,

31:44.684 --> 31:47.389
and he decided to go down there
and confront him about this

31:47.391 --> 31:48.459
with a gun.

31:48.461 --> 31:50.862
Vernon, actually, was a quicker draw

31:50.864 --> 31:53.398
and pulled out his gun
and shot him four times...

31:53.400 --> 31:56.502
the hand, the mouth, the
face, and the ribs.

31:56.504 --> 31:59.004
Take a look at the guy's portrait.

31:59.006 --> 32:01.640
That's Joseph Bossier.

32:01.642 --> 32:05.812
So, is this who you think
you might have seen?

32:05.814 --> 32:08.949
Well, I did a sketch of the person I saw.

32:15.691 --> 32:16.824
Wow.

32:23.060 --> 32:24.660
That's the sketch.

32:24.662 --> 32:27.265
Now look at the portrait.

32:30.234 --> 32:33.572
Looks like the same guy.

32:33.574 --> 32:36.875
It's about as good a sketch and
a portrait as you're gonna get.

32:39.247 --> 32:43.921
Unfortunately,
he felt that you guys were kind of similar,

32:43.923 --> 32:45.223
which is kind of weird.

32:45.225 --> 32:47.393
My personality and his personality

32:47.395 --> 32:49.195
- were like kindred spirits?
- Yeah.

32:49.197 --> 32:50.897
I got to be honest with you.

32:50.899 --> 32:52.831
When I spoke to your ex-wife,
she made it sound like

32:52.833 --> 32:54.499
you were pretty reckless on certain things.

32:54.501 --> 32:57.735
Oh, yeah. I've been notorious.

32:57.737 --> 32:59.505
As far as what?

32:59.507 --> 33:02.509
Making decisions that just made
my life a lot more difficult

33:02.511 --> 33:04.677
if I would have made the right decisions.

33:09.382 --> 33:12.382
How did the rest of the walk go?

33:12.384 --> 33:16.586
So then I went upstairs,
and I met this old lady

33:16.588 --> 33:23.357
that she has a very strong sense
of ownership over the house.

33:23.359 --> 33:25.956
I think at one point that
she owned the property.

33:25.958 --> 33:27.524
But for whatever reason,

33:27.526 --> 33:30.295
she's honed in on your house specifically.

33:30.297 --> 33:33.161
While she was alive,
she was [bleep] about her family.

33:33.163 --> 33:36.829
So she came from a very
dysfunctional family.

33:36.831 --> 33:39.232
She did indicate that she was wealthy,

33:39.234 --> 33:41.964
and I just felt, like,
a sense of isolation.

33:41.966 --> 33:45.467
Like, I do think that she really
just pushed everybody away

33:45.469 --> 33:47.569
because of her attitude problem.

33:47.571 --> 33:50.105
Some of what you're
saying could be his wife

33:50.107 --> 33:53.408
because she did come from wealth.

33:53.410 --> 33:56.914
Now, her name was Frances Bossier.

33:56.916 --> 33:59.350
She inherited the 100 acres
that your house sits on.

33:59.352 --> 34:03.188
This is actually the
deed for her 100 acres.

34:03.190 --> 34:05.992
She actually even sued to
get his name off the deed

34:05.994 --> 34:07.794
'cause he was so reckless with money.

34:07.796 --> 34:08.893
Surprisingly, they stayed married, though.

34:08.896 --> 34:10.396
Interesting.

34:15.704 --> 34:17.806
So, does the woman do
anything to the living

34:17.809 --> 34:19.574
- that are in the house?
- Yes.

34:19.577 --> 34:22.212
She has a very big problem with you.

34:22.214 --> 34:25.117
She admitted that she was physical

34:25.119 --> 34:28.717
and that she was trying
to drive you insane.

34:30.784 --> 34:33.821
What about the physical stuff?
What are we talking about?

34:33.822 --> 34:35.958
She said beating, like hitting.

34:35.960 --> 34:37.792
So I thought, you know, she's beating.

34:37.793 --> 34:40.757
I don't know. Hitting, pinching, shoving.

34:40.760 --> 34:45.195
Well, Rhonda and her daughter
have gotten physical injuries.

34:45.197 --> 34:46.228
They get scratches.

34:48.199 --> 34:51.667
Okay. That's not good.

34:51.668 --> 34:56.406
The one physical thing that
she showed me that she did

34:56.408 --> 34:59.075
was she would literally sit on you.

34:59.077 --> 35:00.476
Oh, my God.

35:00.478 --> 35:03.747
I felt somebody crawl on the bed
before and, like, sit on it.

35:03.749 --> 35:05.515
- Mm-hmm.
- And the bed went down.

35:05.517 --> 35:11.120
Okay, okay. This is really bad.

35:13.557 --> 35:16.728
During my walk, I got that a living woman

35:16.730 --> 35:21.535
was getting very sick from
being exposed to the dead.

35:21.537 --> 35:23.806
I got that it had been going on a few years

35:23.808 --> 35:26.207
and that it had incapacitated this person

35:26.209 --> 35:30.143
and that there had been
several hospital visits.

35:30.145 --> 35:34.750
I've been sick every day
for almost 11 years now.

35:34.752 --> 35:40.726
Nobody knows what happened to me,
why I'm in pain.

35:40.728 --> 35:43.297
I'm incapacitated.
I'll be in bed for weeks at a time.

35:43.299 --> 35:49.032
It's...
it's taken over my life and ruined it.

35:49.034 --> 35:51.334
You got a lot going on so far.

35:51.336 --> 35:55.402
But I know that wasn't the
finish of your walk, was it?

35:55.404 --> 35:56.837
No.

35:56.839 --> 35:59.074
How much more can we take?

35:59.076 --> 36:03.075
So after I left the master bedroom,

36:03.077 --> 36:08.481
I went down the hallway where the kids'
rooms are.

36:08.483 --> 36:14.420
And I saw a little girl sitting
cross-legged on the floor,

36:14.422 --> 36:17.090
talking to the dead lady.

36:17.092 --> 36:19.161
And I tried to go in the room.

36:19.163 --> 36:21.331
I couldn't go in the room.

36:21.333 --> 36:22.999
And that's never happened before.

36:23.001 --> 36:29.904
And then I saw this thing that
I have never seen with a kid.

36:29.906 --> 36:33.207
And that really bothered me.

36:34.777 --> 36:36.446
It can take on different forms.

36:36.448 --> 36:38.515
You know, it can be short or tall.

36:38.517 --> 36:40.983
It can take on an animal-like form.

36:40.985 --> 36:44.586
The one feature that it consistently has

36:44.588 --> 36:46.520
is these wings,

36:46.522 --> 36:49.724
but they're not fully formed.

36:49.726 --> 36:51.859
Well, this gave me a little bit of a chill,
which I never get.

36:51.861 --> 36:54.295
And the only reason I got
a little chill from it

36:54.297 --> 36:56.361
is because when I interviewed Scarlett,

36:56.363 --> 36:57.761
she described seeing a woman

36:57.763 --> 37:01.965
and this creepy,
scaly thing that was crouched down.

37:03.534 --> 37:07.003
And she said it was almost like an alien

37:07.005 --> 37:09.172
but with scales and stuff.

37:09.174 --> 37:11.874
She ever mention that to you?

37:11.876 --> 37:14.612
She told me she's seeing
things in the playroom

37:14.614 --> 37:16.311
that look like aliens.

37:19.049 --> 37:22.018
I had a sketch done of what I saw.

37:32.364 --> 37:34.933
Just be prepared for what you're gonna see.

37:34.935 --> 37:36.902
God.

37:49.810 --> 37:53.345
I had a sketch done of what I saw.

38:02.050 --> 38:04.647
Just be prepared for what you're gonna see.

38:04.649 --> 38:06.649
God.

38:14.193 --> 38:16.661
Gilby sees this and Scarlett.

38:16.663 --> 38:21.068
I never want that to happen again.

38:21.070 --> 38:27.974
Never want my children
to experience that again.

38:27.976 --> 38:31.377
I almost get a feeling it's
like the angel of death.

38:31.379 --> 38:33.113
Oh, no. This is no angel.

38:35.216 --> 38:37.749
Well, it was interesting you said
"like the angel of death."

38:37.751 --> 38:40.051
It's not death.

38:40.053 --> 38:42.388
For lack of a better term,

38:42.390 --> 38:45.790
I guess you would call
them demons and devils.

38:45.792 --> 38:48.092
But they're not that.

38:48.094 --> 38:50.263
They're worse.

38:50.265 --> 38:53.332
And when I've seen it,
it's been with drug addicts,

38:53.334 --> 38:57.866
alcoholics, you know, severe addictions.

38:57.868 --> 39:03.672
So to see it with a child
was utterly bizarre.

39:03.674 --> 39:06.745
This sucker is really evil.

39:06.747 --> 39:09.648
They don't instigate the addiction.

39:09.650 --> 39:14.587
It comes when the person's in
the throes of an addiction,

39:14.589 --> 39:19.689
and it pushes them over the
edge and leads them to death.

39:19.691 --> 39:21.258
And then it keeps their soul.

39:21.260 --> 39:25.291
And it tortures them for eternity.

39:27.458 --> 39:29.528
I've had a problem with drug addictions.

39:30.697 --> 39:34.536
Well, more than likely,
you brought it into the house.

39:34.538 --> 39:37.474
So I'm thinking,
if you got out of your addiction,

39:37.476 --> 39:38.610
maybe he's pissed.

39:38.612 --> 39:40.479
Mm.

39:40.481 --> 39:41.881
He didn't get you.

39:41.883 --> 39:43.983
And then he saw something easier.

39:46.653 --> 39:51.123
I'm in pain a lot, so I take medicine now,

39:51.125 --> 39:52.791
but I'm not addicted to medicine.

39:52.793 --> 39:54.393
Okay.

39:54.395 --> 39:58.432
The problem is,
this thing wants you to become to addicted.

40:03.904 --> 40:07.808
Well, we've had some disturbing
and upsetting reveals before

40:07.810 --> 40:10.544
but, honestly, nothing quite like this.

40:10.546 --> 40:12.412
And, Rhonda, I'm so sorry that
this happened in your house.

40:12.414 --> 40:13.412
I really am.

40:13.414 --> 40:14.980
But now we're gonna find out

40:14.982 --> 40:17.049
if there's anything you can do about it.

40:17.051 --> 40:20.389
And I'm hoping Amy has an answer for you.

40:24.792 --> 40:27.096
You do need to get a medium

40:27.098 --> 40:32.504
and cleanse your house of
the dead that are there

40:32.506 --> 40:36.675
and seal your property so
the dead cannot come back in.

40:36.677 --> 40:40.580
But as far as this thing goes,

40:40.582 --> 40:45.186
the only solution that
there is is in your hands.

40:48.559 --> 40:51.728
It's not something that
somebody can come in

40:51.730 --> 40:53.498
and take care of for you.

40:55.002 --> 40:58.005
Not a lot of people get this warning,

40:58.007 --> 41:01.143
and that's exactly what
this is is a warning.

41:01.145 --> 41:06.146
These are the three reasons
that this needs to stop.

41:07.614 --> 41:11.449
I mean, this thing, it kills people.

41:16.454 --> 41:17.821
I want it away from us.

41:20.925 --> 41:24.694
If I can change whatever's causing the pain

41:24.696 --> 41:27.662
and then start to get healthy again,

41:27.664 --> 41:29.464
get off the medication.

41:31.665 --> 41:34.562
It's gonna take some work.
We've got some work to do.

41:36.063 --> 41:37.864
You think you're gonna
be able to handle this?

41:37.866 --> 41:39.731
Mm-hmm.

41:39.733 --> 41:42.466
I'll get it done.

41:42.468 --> 41:44.469
Whatever I need to do,
I'll take care of it.

41:46.472 --> 41:48.706
I really feel for Rhonda,

41:48.708 --> 41:52.844
as the entities terrorizing her
family present a serious danger.

41:52.846 --> 41:56.579
But I believe if she cleanses
her house of all the dead

41:56.581 --> 41:59.848
and never feeds this demon
what it's looking for,

41:59.850 --> 42:02.553
she and her family should live in peace.
