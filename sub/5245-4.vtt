01:21.958 --> 01:27.589
WANTED: PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA
$100,000 REWARD

04:41.157 --> 04:44.285
Now more than ever
is the time for solidarity.

04:45.453 --> 04:48.957
You make the mistakes,
and then you preach solidarity?

04:49.040 --> 04:51.376
- Shut up, fag.
- What the fuck, Carlos?

04:52.919 --> 04:54.545
Why are you always defending him?

04:54.629 --> 04:56.589
Did he get your sister
back for you or not?

04:56.798 --> 05:00.468
We rescued her
because we did it together. Right?

05:05.056 --> 05:06.432
Gentlemen...

05:09.143 --> 05:11.562
I suggest we form another organization

05:11.646 --> 05:15.066
to fight against
this injustice of extradition.

05:15.149 --> 05:17.360
Like John Lennon said,

05:17.568 --> 05:20.905
- "Come together, hermanos <i>y</i> hermanas--"
- Stop that fag shit now.

05:22.407 --> 05:24.117
So Jorge...

05:25.076 --> 05:26.244
what will we call it?

05:44.554 --> 05:45.972
Next!

05:52.854 --> 05:54.313
Fire!

06:02.739 --> 06:05.575
The gringos are the ones
who use the drugs.

06:06.659 --> 06:10.455
So why are we the ones
who need to be extradited?

06:12.749 --> 06:15.585
I mean, all of the problems

06:15.793 --> 06:19.964
are because of those imperialist gringos!

06:20.173 --> 06:22.592
No, stay there. Stay there.

06:30.475 --> 06:34.020
"Better a grave in Colombia
than a grave in the United States."

06:34.103 --> 06:38.066
I've got it, Fabio, I've got it.
Let's see...

06:38.274 --> 06:42.695
"Better a grave in Colombia
than a cell in the United States."

06:42.779 --> 06:44.989
- What do you think?
- I love it.

06:45.073 --> 06:46.657
Very good.

06:46.741 --> 06:50.161
And for $50,000 more,
we'll make your logo.

06:50.870 --> 06:52.246
Done.

06:53.790 --> 06:56.876
THE EXTRADITABLES

08:10.074 --> 08:13.536
If you speak in favor of extradition,
you will be their puppet,

08:13.619 --> 08:15.955
and that will be your death sentence.

08:16.038 --> 08:20.168
I don't care about the Americans, but I am
still going to support extradition.

08:20.251 --> 08:23.713
Besides, if the gringos want to take away
all the goddamn killers of this country,

08:23.796 --> 08:25.214
then let them take them.

08:59.665 --> 09:01.292
Defendants, please rise.

09:03.044 --> 09:06.839
You've been convicted of cocaine traffic
in Colombia and indicted in the US.

09:07.048 --> 09:13.888
You will immediately be turned over
to the DEA for extradition to America.

11:46.874 --> 11:50.378
- Thank you for seeing me, General.
- You're welcome.

11:50.461 --> 11:54.048
Listen, I have General Gomez
assigned to the operation against Pablo.

11:54.131 --> 11:58.511
With all due respect, General Jaramillo,
I propose Horacio Carrillo.

11:58.594 --> 12:01.555
But Carrillo only acts on his own orders.
He doesn't follow anyone.

12:01.639 --> 12:03.516
Well, I don't want him to follow.

12:04.475 --> 12:06.185
I want him to lead.

12:12.274 --> 12:13.275
Go ahead.

12:14.652 --> 12:16.487
Yes, General.

12:16.570 --> 12:17.738
As you wish.

12:18.739 --> 12:19.949
Understood.

12:23.119 --> 12:25.162
What happened, honey?

12:25.246 --> 12:27.039
Things with work.

12:27.123 --> 12:29.333
At what time does Horacio arrive
to have dinner with us?

12:29.417 --> 12:33.087
I'm making the chicken he likes,
but he's outwith the girlfriend.

12:36.382 --> 12:38.384
Tell me what's wrong.

12:38.592 --> 12:40.803
They want me to catch Pablo Escobar.

12:45.683 --> 12:47.726
The Ochoas aren't happy at all.

12:49.061 --> 12:51.730
They are saying that
since you've become a wanted man,

12:51.814 --> 12:54.483
bribing the police
has become very costly.

12:54.567 --> 12:56.610
They want to renegotiate
the price of our routes.

12:59.697 --> 13:03.200
When it came to me killing
to get their sister back, well, then...

13:03.284 --> 13:05.202
I didn't hear them complaining,
did I?

13:05.286 --> 13:07.955
Yeah. The problem is that
it is one thing to kill communists

13:08.038 --> 13:10.875
- and another to kill politicians.
- So what now?

13:11.083 --> 13:14.795
What I would do better is to increase
the payments to the police, you know?

13:14.879 --> 13:16.172
And most of all, to the top brass.

13:16.380 --> 13:19.675
We're already giving too much money
to those bastards.

13:23.345 --> 13:26.265
Oh, shit. What's that?
Is it snowing or what?

13:27.057 --> 13:29.059
Egrets from the Himalayas.

13:30.019 --> 13:32.646
It took two years
to train them to stay there.

13:33.481 --> 13:35.816
They cost me a million dollars.

13:42.573 --> 13:44.074
Bastards.

13:45.451 --> 13:47.786
Stay in the fucking tree!

13:58.130 --> 14:00.382
Seems like you lost that dough,
eh, cousin?

14:03.010 --> 14:04.553
The thing is,
that's your problem, Pablo.

14:04.637 --> 14:07.139
You think that everything
can be controlled,

14:07.223 --> 14:09.725
but it turns out that nature
cannot be controlled.

14:09.808 --> 14:13.062
OK, OK, OK, Gustavo. OK.

16:36.997 --> 16:38.415
Hand me that coffee.

16:56.558 --> 16:59.603
But you do know where he is hiding,
don't you?

17:20.541 --> 17:22.710
Look, little brother...

17:22.793 --> 17:26.046
I know it scares the shit out of you
that Pablo will kill you.

17:27.798 --> 17:29.967
But I will also kill you.

17:30.801 --> 17:32.136
And very slowly.

17:33.804 --> 17:36.348
Pablo is going to kill me more slowly.

17:36.557 --> 17:41.061
Well, then, you should pray we find him,
and quickly.

17:55.409 --> 17:57.286
Boss!

17:57.369 --> 17:58.370
Poison...

17:58.454 --> 17:59.747
Boss!

18:00.998 --> 18:04.042
They were headed for El Bizcocho,
but they got off the main highway.

18:04.126 --> 18:06.837
- They're already on their way here.
- How far are they?

18:07.045 --> 18:08.172
Two hours, boss.

18:08.380 --> 18:11.717
Round up the guys,
and tell them to get ready.

18:11.800 --> 18:13.719
- We're leaving.
- All right.

18:17.306 --> 18:18.807
We have to go.

18:19.725 --> 18:21.101
Go where?

18:21.185 --> 18:22.895
The police are coming.

18:22.978 --> 18:25.230
- But Pablo, I've been cooking for hours.
- I'm sorry, my love,

18:25.314 --> 18:29.193
- but we need to leave now.
- What about our things? Our clothes?

18:29.276 --> 18:31.153
We'll buy new ones later, won't we?

18:34.990 --> 18:36.283
I'm sorry.

18:37.326 --> 18:39.119
Do you hear me complaining?

18:41.830 --> 18:47.169
Whenever you are with us, Pablo,
I'm prepared to do whatever it takes.

18:56.845 --> 18:59.181
Bring all of the boxes here.

18:59.264 --> 19:03.852
Cangrejo! Go to Pablo's room
and see if anything is in there.

19:03.936 --> 19:05.103
Efrain!

19:05.187 --> 19:07.773
The two blue notebooks
are the only ones I'm taking.

19:11.193 --> 19:14.947
Search the whole house to make sure
that not a single loose document remains.

19:33.215 --> 19:35.050
What's wrong, Gustavo?

19:36.885 --> 19:38.512
You fucked us, Pablo.

19:40.138 --> 19:42.140
Not only you and me.

19:42.224 --> 19:43.851
You fucked the whole family.

19:47.813 --> 19:51.567
But of course, since you needed
to present yourself to Congress...

19:53.610 --> 19:56.321
since you want to be president
of this motherfucking country,

19:56.405 --> 19:58.740
the rest of us get screwed,
isn't that right?

20:04.788 --> 20:06.415
But what the fuck...

20:07.958 --> 20:10.252
a man only dies once, right?

20:13.463 --> 20:14.548
Come here.

20:21.430 --> 20:22.598
My brother.

20:23.724 --> 20:26.435
I'm going to let you sit
next to the pilot. Come on, come on.

20:29.563 --> 20:30.606
There we go.

23:36.958 --> 23:38.835
These are from
the narcos' account in Miami.

23:39.002 --> 23:43.757
A cashier's check
payable to "Ellis McPickle."

23:45.342 --> 23:46.301
Yes.

23:47.344 --> 23:51.431
I've heard that name mentioned
in some of the narco wiretap transcripts.

23:51.515 --> 23:53.016
Obviously, it's an alias.

23:53.100 --> 23:57.020
No Colombian would go by the name
"Ellis McPickle."

23:57.104 --> 23:59.356
He's not Colombian.

23:59.564 --> 24:04.945
He's an American pilot who transports
tons of cocaine for the cartel.

24:05.028 --> 24:06.446
A gringo?

24:07.656 --> 24:10.951
- What's his name?
- We don't know.

24:11.034 --> 24:15.580
But we do know that Gustavo
frequently mentions "McPickle."

24:18.166 --> 24:20.710
Suarez, do you ever worry
what would happen to you

24:20.794 --> 24:24.089
if Pablo finds out
that you work for both sides?

24:25.090 --> 24:27.801
- I'm on your side.
- Yeah?

24:28.009 --> 24:31.596
Prove it.
What else can you tell me about McPickle?

24:33.390 --> 24:37.394
We have his photograph
in some of our files.

24:37.477 --> 24:41.106
Maybe you should check with the CIA.
He started his career with them.

25:48.215 --> 25:49.549
Until next time.

25:59.643 --> 26:01.311
Hi, Vanessa.

31:37.105 --> 31:40.858
There's no way out, Carlitos.
You're going to Disneyland.

32:14.267 --> 32:15.602
Gentlemen?

32:17.312 --> 32:18.646
Thank you.

32:24.902 --> 32:27.947
What happened to Carlos was terrible.

32:29.157 --> 32:32.243
But I have already presented a motion
before the Supreme Court of Colombia

32:32.327 --> 32:35.997
against the legality of extradition.

32:36.080 --> 32:41.002
They are examining it this week
at the Palace of Justice.

32:41.085 --> 32:43.671
Can we buy someone in that court?

32:44.756 --> 32:46.841
Unfortunately, no.

32:46.924 --> 32:50.386
It's the only institution in this country
that is incorruptible.

32:51.471 --> 32:54.474
Let's pray that the ruling
comes out in our favor.

32:54.557 --> 32:57.352
Brother... even after he's dead,

32:57.560 --> 33:00.813
Carlos still has a sentence
of 135 years in prison.

33:00.897 --> 33:02.815
He's totally fucked.

33:03.024 --> 33:04.525
This is gringo bullshit.

33:04.609 --> 33:08.404
That happened to him for speaking
about the revolution on the radio.

33:08.613 --> 33:10.740
We're next, aren't we?

33:10.948 --> 33:12.825
You're right.

33:12.909 --> 33:14.827
Pablito.

33:14.911 --> 33:16.412
Do you have an answer or what?

33:20.500 --> 33:25.588
Well... in my opinion, a jail
in the United States is worse than death.

33:26.798 --> 33:30.301
We can never forget
what happened to Carlos.

33:30.385 --> 33:32.970
Carlos was one of us.

33:34.681 --> 33:39.852
Fabio is right.
The Americans are fucking us.

33:40.061 --> 33:42.188
But remember,
they want someone more than they want us.

33:42.271 --> 33:45.400
So, brothers...

33:46.693 --> 33:48.903
it's time to give them what they want,
isn't it?

33:49.821 --> 33:53.366
I didn't think our paths
would cross again.

33:53.449 --> 33:56.744
It's not so simple, you know?
It's risky.

33:56.828 --> 33:59.664
It's going to require
more men and weapons.

33:59.747 --> 34:01.207
There will be casualties.

34:01.290 --> 34:06.587
I understand what you want.
How much are we talking about?

34:07.463 --> 34:09.215
Two million US dollars.

34:11.384 --> 34:13.094
It's too dangerous.

34:14.804 --> 34:18.057
Fighting a revolution
comes with sacrifice.

34:19.100 --> 34:22.979
It goes without saying,
dangerous or not.

34:33.865 --> 34:35.742
For us, brother...

34:36.492 --> 34:40.329
it is our duty to fight to the very end.

34:41.664 --> 34:45.042
We have an historical obligation.

34:46.544 --> 34:47.962
We can't ignore it.

34:58.306 --> 34:59.891
Meet Pablo Escobar.

35:02.685 --> 35:03.978
Miss.

35:05.021 --> 35:06.731
- OK.
- We have a deal.

35:06.814 --> 35:08.232
You got it.

35:09.066 --> 35:09.901
We were just leaving.

35:11.652 --> 35:12.904
Good night.

35:20.244 --> 35:22.538
What the hell is this?

35:22.622 --> 35:24.749
Why are you meeting with Escobar?

35:24.832 --> 35:26.793
We made an agreement.

35:26.876 --> 35:28.544
Obviously about money.

35:29.629 --> 35:31.339
In exchange for what?

35:31.547 --> 35:35.968
Unless you are willing to be part of it,
l cannot say.

35:38.554 --> 35:43.059
It's a partnership,
necessary for the revolutionary fight.

35:43.142 --> 35:47.522
I fight for the people...
not for drug traffickers.

41:05.756 --> 41:09.135
They're looking for us everywhere.

41:09.218 --> 41:11.178
What did you expect?

41:11.262 --> 41:13.222
That it would be any different?

41:16.725 --> 41:19.770
You did a very good job.

41:33.450 --> 41:37.037
You can't imagine how much
this is going to help our cause.

41:37.246 --> 41:40.291
No, brother.
The truth is, you helped mine.

41:43.460 --> 41:45.004
You, Ivan...

41:46.088 --> 41:49.341
gave me the sword of Simén Bolívar.

41:51.135 --> 41:53.888
The same one that freed this country.

41:59.727 --> 42:01.478
Now it belongs to you.

42:06.025 --> 42:11.405
With it, you will continue the fight...
to free this country.

42:14.617 --> 42:17.578
I promise you, I will continue the fight.

42:17.786 --> 42:19.747
You earned it, brother.

42:21.248 --> 42:23.042
As for me...

42:24.376 --> 42:26.378
I'll be in Panama until this blows over.

42:27.421 --> 42:28.923
We are also--

42:33.302 --> 42:35.429
Make sure you grab the briefcase.

42:37.181 --> 42:38.807
And the fucking sword.
