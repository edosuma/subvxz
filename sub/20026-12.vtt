00:00.749 --> 00:02.333
(MUSIC PLAYING)

00:02.333 --> 00:03.666
ROCKET:<i> Finally,</i>
<i>enough credits in the bank.</i>

00:03.666 --> 00:05.957
<i>Let's go buy that ship</i>
<i>of our dreams, Groot.</i>

00:05.957 --> 00:07.416
(THUDS)

00:07.416 --> 00:09.832
What a beauty.
Take my money now!

00:09.832 --> 00:12.291
(KISSING) At last,
you're mine!

00:12.291 --> 00:15.499
I'm afraid not.
During your absence,
due to economic issues,

00:15.499 --> 00:17.291
there was a small
price increase.

00:17.291 --> 00:19.499
What?

00:19.499 --> 00:21.749
Come on. You're a dealer,
make me a deal!

00:21.749 --> 00:23.083
I do have an idea.

00:23.083 --> 00:25.041
What will you do
with your old ship?
Take it!

00:28.707 --> 00:30.083
What a bargain!

00:30.083 --> 00:31.541
ROCKET:<i> Bam! Ha-ha!</i>

00:31.541 --> 00:32.915
Keep unpacking your stuff

00:32.915 --> 00:35.749
while I enjoy...
(BREATHES DEEPLY)
That new ship smell.

00:35.749 --> 00:37.333
I am Groot.
Yeah, yeah.

00:37.333 --> 00:38.915
You love that
old helmet of yours.

00:38.915 --> 00:41.832
Nostalgia's fine.
But I look the future
straight in the eye.

00:41.832 --> 00:44.249
(EXCLAIMS)<i> I'm Al,</i>
<i>the AI of this ship.</i>

00:44.249 --> 00:46.208
<i>I will instruct...</i>
(EXPLODES)

00:46.208 --> 00:47.957
<i>Instruct you in what behavior</i>
<i>is appropriate on board</i>
<i>a ship of my stature.</i>

00:47.957 --> 00:49.083
Really?

00:49.083 --> 00:50.457
<i>Too fatty.</i>

00:50.457 --> 00:51.790
<i>No, there is a speed limit</i>
<i>in this sector.</i>

00:51.790 --> 00:53.083
<i>No, too retro!</i>

00:53.083 --> 00:54.457
(SLURPING)
<i>Too noisy.</i>

00:54.457 --> 00:55.874
<i>Too tall! Too long!</i>
<i>Too bushy!</i>

00:55.874 --> 00:57.000
<i>Too...</i>
Stop!

00:57.000 --> 00:58.832
Take us back
to the Junkyard.

00:58.832 --> 00:59.957
ROCKET:<i> We want</i>
<i>our money back!</i>

00:59.957 --> 01:01.874
Oh, I am so sorry.

01:01.874 --> 01:03.499
All sales are final.
What?

01:03.499 --> 01:04.790
You thief...
(EXCLAIMS)

01:04.790 --> 01:06.416
Give me back
my old ship.

01:06.416 --> 01:09.083
Your former ship
happens to be a classic,
one-of-a-kind.

01:09.083 --> 01:10.790
You never knew
what you had, did you?

01:10.790 --> 01:12.666
But if you want to
make a deal,

01:12.666 --> 01:14.499
I have an idea.
(SNARLS)

01:16.374 --> 01:18.541
What a steal.

01:18.541 --> 01:21.166
ROCKET: Come on, Groot.
I know you love
that old helmet,

01:21.166 --> 01:24.957
but look on the bright side.
Our classic ship is back.

01:24.957 --> 01:27.124
(ENGINE STOPS)
GROOT: I am Groot!

01:27.124 --> 01:29.416
ROCKET: Yeah, yeah.
No one likes to be
told, "I told you so."
