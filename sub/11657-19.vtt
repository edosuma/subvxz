(mellow music playing)

00:54.867 --> 00:57.166
(mumbles)

00:57.233 --> 00:58.100
...carry the two.

00:59.400 --> 01:02.166
Frankly, I wouldn't even bother
getting another estimate.

01:02.233 --> 01:04.433
For that bathroom repair,
that's the lowest you're gonna see.

01:04.500 --> 01:06.900
Are you kid...
This is the highest I've seen.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.500
-Look.
-$3,000!

01:09.567 --> 01:12.500
Hey, ladies, hire whoever you like,
but I'm an expert.

01:12.567 --> 01:15.367
I can take a toilet apart blindfolded.

01:15.433 --> 01:18.333
Now, there's a dying art.
What's your point?

01:18.400 --> 01:21.000
The point is,
a lot of things can go wrong.

01:21.066 --> 01:23.433
Wood rot, loose plaster, cracked pipes.

01:23.500 --> 01:24.834
Crooked plumbers.

01:25.300 --> 01:26.967
Lady, what are you trying to say?

01:27.033 --> 01:27.867
Get out.

01:28.767 --> 01:29.967
All right, all right.

01:30.033 --> 01:33.633
I guess you ladies are going into
your feminist phase a little late in life.

01:33.700 --> 01:34.934
But I'll go.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.133
You'll call me back.

01:36.200 --> 01:37.166
You know why?

01:37.233 --> 01:39.367
Because as we say in the plumbing game...

01:41.133 --> 01:43.867
The nerve of that man
trying to intimidate us!

01:43.934 --> 01:45.567
I mean, he must really think we're stupid.

01:45.633 --> 01:47.100
Really stupid.

01:47.166 --> 01:50.500
How could we possibly need
three dozen spud gaskets?

01:51.300 --> 01:52.867
Wait. Spud gaskets?

01:52.934 --> 01:55.000
That's what goes on the end of a hose bib.

01:55.066 --> 01:57.700
We couldn't need more
than a dozen at most.

01:59.400 --> 02:01.633
Rose, how do you know about this?

02:01.700 --> 02:03.700
Oh, I know a lot about plumbing.

02:03.767 --> 02:06.100
We always did our own plumbing
on the farm.

02:06.166 --> 02:09.133
'Course, we didn't actually get plumbing
till I was 18.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.600
Rose, tell me something.

02:12.400 --> 02:16.667
How difficult would it be for us
to repair that bathroom ourselves?

02:16.734 --> 02:18.633
Well, it wouldn't be difficult at all.

02:18.700 --> 02:21.433
Oh, forget it, forget it.
It's a crazy idea.

02:21.500 --> 02:22.600
You got that right.

02:24.500 --> 02:27.100
You're not a mechanical person, Dorothy.
You never were.

02:27.166 --> 02:30.133
For the first three months of your life,
you tried to breast-feed off my cameo.

02:36.533 --> 02:38.967
Rose, come on.
Do you really think we could do it?

02:39.033 --> 02:42.633
It might take a little time,
but we'd sure save a lot of money.

02:42.700 --> 02:44.567
Then let's give it a shot.

02:46.767 --> 02:49.900
Great, my unmarried daughter
wants to spend her weekend with a toilet.

02:49.967 --> 02:51.567
Now I can die in peace.

02:52.967 --> 02:55.867
Dorothy, could I please borrow
your long rhinestone chain?

02:55.934 --> 02:56.700
Of course, Blanche.

02:56.767 --> 02:59.567
Why not? What's Dorothy gonna do with it,
snake out a toilet?

03:01.066 --> 03:03.800
It's just so hard to dress
for these dates with Richard.

03:03.867 --> 03:05.467
I never know where we'll end up.

03:05.533 --> 03:06.834
Oh, come on now, Blanche.

03:06.900 --> 03:09.400
Even the paperboy knows
where you'll end up.

03:10.767 --> 03:12.633
You know what I mean.

03:12.700 --> 03:15.066
With Richard,
I have to be prepared for anything.

03:15.133 --> 03:16.967
Last week, he asked me out to lunch.

03:17.033 --> 03:18.667
We ended up going horseback riding.

03:18.734 --> 03:21.667
Personally, I've always been afraid
of dating a wealthy man.

03:21.734 --> 03:24.100
Why, Rose? Fear of gold bullion?

03:25.633 --> 03:29.533
No. It's just that sometimes,
rich people think more about money

03:29.600 --> 03:30.934
than they do about people.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.033
Richard's nothing like that,
and I don't think he ever could be.

03:34.100 --> 03:39.066
He is simply the sweetest, kindest,
most handsome man I've ever met.

03:39.133 --> 03:41.600
Only I do have a small problem
with his money.

03:41.667 --> 03:42.600
Oh, why?

03:42.667 --> 03:44.667
You don't think you'll live long enough
to spend it all?

03:45.600 --> 03:46.266
No.

03:46.333 --> 03:50.233
I just don't want him to think that's
the only reason I'm attracted to him.

03:50.300 --> 03:52.100
That's why, whenever we're out together,

03:52.166 --> 03:55.033
I always pretend to be totally unimpressed
by his wealth.

03:55.100 --> 03:56.500
Isn't that kind of difficult?

03:56.567 --> 03:59.600
Oh, no, not at all.
I don't give a hoot how much he has.

04:00.033 --> 04:02.834
Fact is, I think I'm falling in love.

04:02.900 --> 04:04.800
Oh, come on now, Blanche.

04:04.867 --> 04:07.567
Are you telling me that you'd feel
the same way about him

04:07.633 --> 04:09.300
if he didn't have a dime to his name?

04:09.367 --> 04:10.767
Absolutely.

04:10.834 --> 04:12.967
I'd just have to see other men
behind his back.

04:14.300 --> 04:16.266
Oh, come on.

04:19.633 --> 04:22.633
(mellow music playing)

04:39.700 --> 04:41.233
(whirs)

04:41.734 --> 04:44.667
Oh, my good... No! Oh, come back here.

04:44.734 --> 04:45.433
Oh.

04:45.500 --> 04:49.300
("Moonlight Serenade"
by Glen Miller playing)

04:49.367 --> 04:50.033
Oh.

04:53.600 --> 04:56.367
I see you're right at home
in a private jet.

04:56.433 --> 05:00.700
Oh, well, I always try to take
a private jet whenever I jet.

05:00.767 --> 05:01.967
(laughs)

05:02.033 --> 05:03.900
And here I thought I was impressing you.

05:03.967 --> 05:07.734
Oh, well, it's a perfectly lovely jet,
Richard,

05:07.800 --> 05:12.066
but there was really no need
to fly all the way to Atlanta for dinner.

05:12.133 --> 05:13.767
I'm just an old-fashioned girl.

05:13.834 --> 05:16.533
I would have been very happy
with a quiet dinner at home.

05:16.600 --> 05:18.867
-You would?
-Absolutely!

05:18.934 --> 05:21.133
I'll just tell the pilot
to turn the plane around.

05:21.200 --> 05:22.600
No, wait!

05:22.667 --> 05:25.266
Oh, that won't be necessary.

05:25.333 --> 05:27.900
My goodness, we're 10,000 feet up.

05:27.967 --> 05:30.967
Besides, I know how you have
your heart set on it.

05:32.367 --> 05:34.033
Blanche, you're adorable.

05:34.100 --> 05:35.033
I know.

05:37.200 --> 05:38.633
You know, I've dated a lot of women,

05:39.100 --> 05:43.300
and every single one of them
has been impressed by the caviar

05:43.367 --> 05:46.033
and the expensive restaurants and the jet.

05:46.100 --> 05:47.066
(giggles)

05:47.133 --> 05:48.867
Hell, even I'm impressed by the jet.

05:50.834 --> 05:54.400
No, I haven't been wealthy all my life,
you know?

05:54.467 --> 05:56.000
-Oh, really?
-No.

05:56.066 --> 05:56.734
Oh!

05:58.367 --> 06:02.000
I started out in the shipping department
of a large manufacturing company.

06:02.066 --> 06:03.100
Oh.

06:03.166 --> 06:06.834
And after lots of hard work
and long hours,

06:06.900 --> 06:08.233
ten years later, I owned the company.

06:08.800 --> 06:10.433
-Uh-huh.
-Mm-hmm.

06:11.166 --> 06:14.967
And now I own a lot of companies
with branches all over the world.

06:15.033 --> 06:16.266
And the amazing thing is,

06:16.333 --> 06:20.266
the work is just as exciting to me now
as it was the day I started.

06:20.333 --> 06:22.000
How about some champagne?

06:23.934 --> 06:27.567
This isn't meant to impress you.
This is just to get you tipsy.

06:27.633 --> 06:30.767
Oh, Richard, you rascal.
(chuckles)

06:32.200 --> 06:34.333
You know, I've made a lot of money

06:34.900 --> 06:36.533
and I've seen a lot of the world,

06:37.433 --> 06:39.667
but there's still one thing in my life
that's missing.

06:40.333 --> 06:42.400
-What?
-Someone to share it with.

06:42.867 --> 06:44.500
I was hoping you'd say that.

06:45.066 --> 06:47.000
Did that champagne kick in yet?

06:47.667 --> 06:52.266
No, but if you're ready to make your move,
I can pretend it did.

06:54.200 --> 06:54.900
Aah!

06:54.967 --> 06:57.967
(mellow music playing)

07:06.967 --> 07:07.734
(gasps)

07:07.800 --> 07:10.000
Oh, Dorothy, you scared me.

07:10.066 --> 07:11.100
What are you doing up so late?

07:11.166 --> 07:14.767
Honey, do you know what's behind that wall
that you're banging on?

07:14.834 --> 07:17.433
A lateral fusion pipe.

07:18.200 --> 07:22.066
And do you know what's on the other side
of that lateral fusion pipe?

07:22.133 --> 07:23.734
-No.
-My head!

07:25.367 --> 07:26.467
Oh, I...

07:28.734 --> 07:30.333
I'm sorry.

07:30.400 --> 07:32.233
It's just that I was so excited.

07:32.300 --> 07:34.567
I think I might have stumbled on something

07:34.633 --> 07:37.467
that could change the face of plumbing
as we know it.

07:37.533 --> 07:39.233
Oh, great, Rose.

07:39.300 --> 07:40.834
Call the tidy bowl man.

07:40.900 --> 07:42.834
He'll jump in his boat
and spread the news.

07:44.367 --> 07:49.000
Oh, girls, I'm so glad you're still up.
Wait till I tell you about my date.

07:49.066 --> 07:51.333
-Wait till I tell you about my discovery.
-Let's hear it.

07:51.400 --> 07:55.500
It came to me when I was enjoying
my second cup of Ovaltine.

07:55.567 --> 07:59.233
Richard flew me to Atlanta
for dinner in his private jet.

07:59.300 --> 08:00.133
You're kidding.

08:00.200 --> 08:01.567
That's when it hit me.

08:01.633 --> 08:03.333
We don't need our sludge tube.

08:03.400 --> 08:04.333
Rose.

08:06.333 --> 08:10.367
And then, for dessert, he took me
to this most romantic little bistro.

08:10.433 --> 08:13.000
And while the waiter
was glazing my peaches,

08:13.066 --> 08:14.600
Richard leaned over and took my hand.

08:14.667 --> 08:15.867
-You know what he said?
-What?

08:15.934 --> 08:18.300
Our biggest worry will be tank sweat.

08:24.200 --> 08:24.934
Sorry.

08:25.433 --> 08:29.266
He said that tomorrow,
he wants to introduce me to his family.

08:29.333 --> 08:32.166
If that is not the last step
before a marriage proposal,

08:32.233 --> 08:33.367
I don't know what is.

08:33.433 --> 08:37.233
-Oh, that is wonderful!
-I'm so excited.

08:37.300 --> 08:39.800
Just imagine being Richard's wife.

08:39.867 --> 08:42.734
I would be married to a gorgeous,
intelligent man.

08:42.800 --> 08:44.400
I'd be living like a queen.

08:44.467 --> 08:46.500
Think about it in your room,
your highness.

08:46.567 --> 08:47.767
I need to use the throne.

08:49.734 --> 08:52.734
(quirky music playing)

09:01.100 --> 09:03.800
You're a wonderful plumber's assistant,
Dorothy.

09:04.166 --> 09:06.300
Boy, you sure know your way
around a snake.

09:08.133 --> 09:09.633
I've had a lot of experience.

09:11.033 --> 09:13.333
After all, I was married to one
for 38 years.

09:15.500 --> 09:17.166
Oh, we're right on schedule.

09:17.233 --> 09:19.100
We ought to have that toilet tank in
by sundown.

09:19.166 --> 09:21.133
By sundown. By sundown!

09:21.200 --> 09:23.000
Oh, this is such fun.

09:23.066 --> 09:25.967
-I know.
-This is so exciting.

09:26.033 --> 09:28.533
This is so depressing.

09:29.834 --> 09:32.400
Oh, it's Saturday night,
and I'm all nervous and jumpy

09:32.467 --> 09:36.200
because, in a few hours, there will be
a handsome new toilet at my door.

09:37.867 --> 09:39.734
What's going on here?

09:39.800 --> 09:42.166
I walk into the bathroom,
and instead of a toilet,

09:42.233 --> 09:43.633
there's a hole in the ground.

09:44.033 --> 09:45.900
For a minute,
I thought I was back in Sicily.

09:48.266 --> 09:51.533
Sophia, I'm sure Blanche wouldn't mind
if you used her bathroom.

09:51.600 --> 09:52.667
I hate that bathroom.

09:52.734 --> 09:55.600
There's plants everywhere
and flowers on the toilet-seat cover.

09:55.667 --> 09:57.200
I feel like I'm going in the woods.

09:58.700 --> 10:00.000
(doorbell rings)

10:00.066 --> 10:01.967
Gee, I hope that's our new toilet.

10:02.033 --> 10:04.266
Now, that's a sentence
you don't hear every day.

10:08.467 --> 10:10.667
-Plumber.
-Could I see some identification?

10:12.200 --> 10:12.967
(cackles)

10:13.033 --> 10:14.300
Come on in.

10:16.100 --> 10:19.934
So, you two are the proud parents
of the new Dolan standard lowboy.

10:20.000 --> 10:23.600
Yes. We're sending out
engraved announcements.

10:23.667 --> 10:26.233
Well, you probably want to get her
operational as soon as possible.

10:26.300 --> 10:28.066
After all, she's quite a showpiece.

10:28.700 --> 10:29.667
Where do I install her?

10:29.734 --> 10:34.300
Well, actually, Lou,
we're going to install her ourselves.

10:34.367 --> 10:36.567
-Follow me.
-Hold it. You're not serious.

10:36.633 --> 10:37.767
Why not?

10:37.834 --> 10:41.333
Ladies, the installation of a toilet's
a very delicate procedure.

10:41.734 --> 10:45.333
You got to go to school,
you got to be a trained technician.

10:45.934 --> 10:48.066
You got to be a man, for God's sakes!

10:48.934 --> 10:51.600
You know, to tell you the truth, Lou,

10:51.667 --> 10:54.967
women are capable of more
than just cleaning these things.

10:55.700 --> 10:56.667
Is that so?

10:56.734 --> 10:58.767
Well, as long as you ladies
are playing plumber,

10:58.834 --> 11:00.300
why don't you play moving man, too?

11:00.367 --> 11:02.100
Fine, fine, we will!

11:03.867 --> 11:06.100
-Was that a plumber?
-No, Ma, no.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.500
It was a little girl
selling girl scout toilets.

11:10.667 --> 11:12.300
You let a plumber get away?

11:12.367 --> 11:13.600
We don't need him!

11:13.667 --> 11:14.633
Like hell!

11:14.700 --> 11:15.834
I'm going after him.

11:18.834 --> 11:21.166
Come on, Dorothy,
let's move this little beauty.

11:22.266 --> 11:23.166
Ok.

11:23.233 --> 11:24.834
-Ooh.
-(both grunting)

11:24.900 --> 11:28.700
Wait, wait. No, honey, she won't budge.

11:29.233 --> 11:31.834
Oh, Rose, I don't think
we're gonna be able to move it.

11:31.900 --> 11:34.166
Dorothy, if the Egyptians
built the pyramids,

11:34.233 --> 11:35.500
now, we can move this toilet.

11:35.567 --> 11:39.467
Fine, get me 20,000 Hebrews,
and I'll have it out of here in no time.

11:42.567 --> 11:44.166
Oh, come on.

11:45.600 --> 11:48.100
Give me a minute, I'll think of something.

11:48.967 --> 11:50.834
I'd love you to meet my roommates.

11:58.033 --> 12:00.367
Unfortunately, they're not home right now.

12:01.967 --> 12:03.600
I'll talk to you later, darlin'.

12:03.667 --> 12:05.233
Bye.

12:05.300 --> 12:06.033
Bye.

12:08.900 --> 12:10.100
Oh, Blanche, I'm sorry.

12:10.166 --> 12:11.367
Oh, forget it.

12:11.433 --> 12:14.633
Girls, I have something very important
to tell you.

12:14.700 --> 12:16.667
-(Dorothy) What is it?
-Look.

12:16.734 --> 12:17.467
(gasps)

12:17.533 --> 12:19.066
He proposed!

12:19.133 --> 12:23.266
Oh, Blanche, that is the biggest diamond
I've ever seen!

12:23.333 --> 12:24.000
(Blanche) I know.

12:24.066 --> 12:26.000
Oh, I think this is wonderful.

12:26.066 --> 12:27.600
It was wonderful.

12:27.667 --> 12:30.100
It was beautiful, it was romantic.

12:30.166 --> 12:32.000
It was just everything I dreamed
it could be.

12:32.066 --> 12:35.200
Oh, Blanche, we're so happy for you!

12:35.266 --> 12:36.533
Well, don't be.

12:37.100 --> 12:38.400
'Cause I can't marry him.

12:38.467 --> 12:41.467
(somber music playing)

12:44.900 --> 12:48.133
(mellow music playing)

12:48.600 --> 12:50.633
Why can't you marry him?

12:51.033 --> 12:54.300
You remember I told you Richard
wanted to introduce me to his family?

12:54.367 --> 12:56.233
I thought it would be his little
old gray-haired mama

12:56.300 --> 12:57.266
and his spinster aunt.

12:57.767 --> 12:59.667
Turns out, he has two kids.

13:00.133 --> 13:01.467
Well, Blanche, we've all got kids.

13:01.533 --> 13:03.300
But these are seven and nine.

13:03.367 --> 13:05.166
They're practically babies.

13:05.233 --> 13:07.133
Babies need a mama.

13:07.200 --> 13:08.800
Goodness, I've already raised my family.

13:08.867 --> 13:11.100
I don't have the energy
to go through that again.

13:11.467 --> 13:14.300
Blanche, how could you accept
his proposal?

13:14.367 --> 13:16.667
Because it was the moment
I'd been dreaming about

13:16.734 --> 13:21.033
and everything was just so perfect,
and before I knew it, I said yes.

13:21.533 --> 13:23.166
Only now, I have to tell him no.

13:23.233 --> 13:27.333
But how can I say no to the man I love?
I can't even say no to the men I like.

13:29.200 --> 13:31.033
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

13:33.500 --> 13:36.100
Blanche, honey, calm down.

13:36.166 --> 13:37.867
Let's talk it out. You'll feel better.

13:37.934 --> 13:39.800
Oh, there's nothing to talk about!

13:39.867 --> 13:41.900
I already know
what both of you are gonna say.

13:41.967 --> 13:44.467
Dorothy will say
he's too good to give up over this

13:44.533 --> 13:45.600
and she'd marry him.

13:45.667 --> 13:49.000
You'll say he's been nothing but trouble,
and you wouldn't marry him.

13:49.066 --> 13:50.133
I'd marry him.

13:50.200 --> 13:51.166
Well, I wouldn't.

13:52.767 --> 13:53.633
What?

13:53.700 --> 13:56.367
Well, no.
I don't want to be a mother again, either.

13:56.433 --> 13:58.667
Oh, I'd love to be a mother again.

13:58.734 --> 14:01.000
Scrubbing socks, picking up toys?

14:01.066 --> 14:03.433
Tucking in beds, packing healthy lunches.

14:03.500 --> 14:05.367
Phone calls, pajama parties?

14:05.433 --> 14:07.233
Dance recitals, baseball games.

14:07.300 --> 14:08.767
-(Dorothy) Cooking?
-(Rose) Singing.

14:08.834 --> 14:09.834
-Worrying?
-Praying.

14:09.900 --> 14:10.767
Girls!

14:11.133 --> 14:13.567
I thought we came in here
to discuss my problem.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.367
Sorry, Blanche.

14:15.834 --> 14:20.166
I just hate myself for feeling this way,
but I don't want to be a mother again.

14:20.233 --> 14:23.300
I mean, it was a wonderful experience
at the time,

14:23.367 --> 14:26.533
but I always thought this part of my life
was supposed to be for me.

14:26.600 --> 14:28.767
Honey, I understand exactly how you feel.

14:28.834 --> 14:30.467
I feel the same way.

14:30.533 --> 14:34.333
You know, at our age,
we should be grandmothers, not mothers.

14:34.400 --> 14:38.200
Once a week,
the grandchildren come over for a visit.

14:38.266 --> 14:40.834
You cook them dinner,
they spill it on the furniture.

14:41.867 --> 14:43.700
They hide under your bed.

14:44.166 --> 14:46.233
You hurt yourself looking for them.

14:46.967 --> 14:49.967
They ask you what those spots
on your hands are.

14:51.633 --> 14:53.066
They tell you they love you,

14:53.133 --> 14:55.934
and then,
just before total exhaustion sets in,

14:56.000 --> 14:58.633
they go home
and become their mother's problems.

14:59.233 --> 15:02.467
What about the good things,
like Mother's Day?

15:02.934 --> 15:06.300
Oh, the mother's days
we used to have on the farm.

15:06.800 --> 15:08.400
First of all, the kids would wake me up

15:08.467 --> 15:11.767
by brushing our cat,
Mr. McTavish, against my ear.

15:11.834 --> 15:12.667
(giggles)

15:12.734 --> 15:13.400
(sighs)

15:13.467 --> 15:15.200
Then they'd give me breakfast in bed...

15:15.266 --> 15:17.600
Belgian waffles and buttermilk.

15:17.667 --> 15:19.700
And then they'd paint faces on their socks

15:19.767 --> 15:22.867
and do a little puppet show
called <i>Elf Kingdom</i>.

15:22.934 --> 15:23.633
(Dorothy) Oh.

15:24.834 --> 15:27.100
And then everybody would tickle each other

15:27.166 --> 15:29.867
until the whole family
was throwing up together.

15:34.300 --> 15:36.767
Oh, dear, I'm just so confused.

15:36.834 --> 15:39.700
Aw, honey, listen, you need more time.

15:39.767 --> 15:42.500
I mean, right now, you're too upset
to make the right decision.

15:42.567 --> 15:46.500
Maybe you could spend a few days
with Richard and his children.

15:46.567 --> 15:47.266
See how it goes.

15:47.333 --> 15:49.266
Oh, I don't know.

15:49.834 --> 15:51.033
What if they hate me?

15:51.100 --> 15:52.433
What if I hate them?

15:52.500 --> 15:55.266
Honey, what if you all end up
liking each other?

15:55.967 --> 15:59.600
Yeah, I guess I could at least
give it a chance.

16:00.266 --> 16:02.266
Ok, then, that's what I'm going to do.

16:03.066 --> 16:05.100
Dorothy, I got to talk to you.

16:05.166 --> 16:06.800
I owe you a big apology.

16:06.867 --> 16:08.767
-For what, Ma?
-For what I said before.

16:08.834 --> 16:11.567
You know, about you not knowing a thing
about plumbing.

16:11.633 --> 16:13.166
Dorothy, you're a genius!

16:13.233 --> 16:15.000
Ma, wait a minute.
What are you talking about?

16:15.066 --> 16:16.967
I walk into the living room,

16:17.033 --> 16:19.367
and there's a toilet
in front of the television set.

16:20.533 --> 16:22.767
It's an old lady's dream come true!

16:26.066 --> 16:29.066
(mellow music playing)

16:35.700 --> 16:38.000
"Grasp the valve tightly with your hand."

16:39.100 --> 16:40.300
Ok.

16:40.367 --> 16:45.000
"Turn it clockwise
until scum gathers on your elbow joint."

16:49.300 --> 16:51.500
Oh, I'm sorry. I skipped page 62.

16:51.567 --> 16:52.567
Listen, Rose...

16:52.967 --> 16:54.333
Rose, this is not working!

16:54.400 --> 16:56.867
We've been here a whole week,
and nothing has gone right!

16:56.934 --> 16:58.400
I'm ready to throw in the wrench

16:58.467 --> 17:01.000
and start using the Texaco station
down the street!

17:01.867 --> 17:03.333
Dorothy, don't panic.

17:03.400 --> 17:04.834
You just need a break.

17:04.900 --> 17:07.800
Why don't we wash our hands
and have a nice cup of tea?

17:08.934 --> 17:11.233
(water running)

17:13.266 --> 17:15.200
Rose, turn it off!

17:15.600 --> 17:17.000
I can't make it stop!

17:19.100 --> 17:20.700
Very nice job, ladies.

17:20.767 --> 17:21.967
Who let you in here?

17:22.033 --> 17:24.033
I did. Lucky, I had his card.

17:26.233 --> 17:26.900
(grunts)

17:28.934 --> 17:31.033
Looks like we've taken
a few wrong turns here.

17:32.000 --> 17:35.367
For your information, this is exactly
the way we wanted it to look.

17:36.667 --> 17:37.500
Oh, yeah?

17:37.567 --> 17:39.200
You got Siamese twins living here?

17:40.800 --> 17:43.333
Look, Lou, we really don't need your help.

17:43.400 --> 17:44.667
Ladies, with all due respect,

17:44.734 --> 17:46.533
I think it's time you threw
in the dishtowel.

17:46.600 --> 17:49.633
I mean, trying to fix it yourself
was cute,

17:49.700 --> 17:52.867
but I think you proved your point,
and it's time to let a man take over.

17:52.934 --> 17:53.667
I'm with Lou!

17:53.734 --> 17:55.633
Oh? Get your coat! Lou is leaving.

17:55.700 --> 17:58.433
Hey, not so hard! I work with my hands!

18:01.066 --> 18:02.200
You're making a big mistake!

18:02.266 --> 18:04.667
The man may be a moron,
but he knows how to fix a toilet!

18:04.734 --> 18:06.066
It's fine with me.

18:06.133 --> 18:07.767
The longer I let you do it yourself,

18:07.834 --> 18:09.633
the more I'm gonna get paid
when you finally call.

18:09.700 --> 18:11.967
Yeah, well, I have news for you, Lou.

18:12.033 --> 18:13.934
We are not calling. Ever!

18:14.000 --> 18:15.667
You ladies haven't seen the last of me.

18:15.734 --> 18:16.900
And you wanna know why?

18:16.967 --> 18:19.233
Because as we say in the plumbing game,
it's nev--

18:23.400 --> 18:24.400
Hi, girls.

18:24.834 --> 18:25.967
(Rose) When did you get back?

18:26.033 --> 18:27.033
Oh, a few minutes ago.

18:27.100 --> 18:28.767
What a day! I'm exhausted.

18:28.834 --> 18:30.000
Oh, where did you go?

18:30.066 --> 18:30.934
Bermuda!

18:31.400 --> 18:32.867
Only Richard had a last-minute
appointment,

18:32.934 --> 18:34.967
so it was just me and the kids.

18:35.033 --> 18:36.700
Oh, we had a terrific time, though...

18:36.767 --> 18:38.867
Swimming and playing and talking.

18:38.934 --> 18:40.133
They're lovely children.

18:40.200 --> 18:42.133
Does this mean you're gonna marry Richard?

18:42.200 --> 18:43.967
I don't know.

18:44.033 --> 18:45.300
Honey, I don't understand.

18:45.367 --> 18:47.967
If you and the kids hit it off,
then what's the problem?

18:48.033 --> 18:50.166
Well, I hardly ever see Richard.

18:50.233 --> 18:53.400
Today was the third time this week
he's had a last-minute meeting,

18:53.467 --> 18:55.066
and I had to spend the day with the kids.

18:55.133 --> 18:56.600
He's a busy man.

18:56.667 --> 18:57.500
Too busy.

18:58.033 --> 19:01.233
Even little Richard came up to me
and said, "Now, don't worry.

19:01.300 --> 19:02.934
This happens all the time."

19:03.000 --> 19:05.567
Little Richard was in Bermuda?

19:13.166 --> 19:14.100
Yes, Rose.

19:14.166 --> 19:16.867
He was burying fats domino in the sand.

19:18.066 --> 19:18.967
Go ahead, Blanche.

19:19.600 --> 19:23.133
Richard's always talking
about how much his children mean to him.

19:23.200 --> 19:26.800
And I know they do, but, you know,
he hardly has time for 'em.

19:27.567 --> 19:28.700
Or for me.

19:29.867 --> 19:31.967
I'm starting to wonder
if maybe the main reason

19:32.033 --> 19:33.433
he wants me for his wife

19:33.500 --> 19:36.233
is because he needs a mother
for his children.

19:36.300 --> 19:39.633
Well, honey, if you think that's true,
you'd better find out.

19:39.700 --> 19:41.233
I intend to.

19:41.300 --> 19:43.934
I'm gonna ask him straight out
at dinner tonight.

19:45.033 --> 19:47.433
I just hope he has the answer
I want to hear.

19:50.100 --> 19:53.100
(somber music playing)

19:58.100 --> 19:58.767
(Richard) No.

19:59.834 --> 20:00.600
No, no.

20:01.934 --> 20:04.867
Don't worry. I'll be there tomorrow.
We'll handle the situation.

20:05.734 --> 20:07.934
Tell Gresham we can get together
next week.

20:08.633 --> 20:11.066
No, he'll have to come here.
I can't go to the coast.

20:11.667 --> 20:14.166
No, we're gonna have to try
to keep that whole week clear

20:14.233 --> 20:15.433
for my honeymoon.

20:16.500 --> 20:18.033
Sometime around the 17th.

20:19.734 --> 20:21.500
Well, if you can close it, all right,
do so.

20:21.567 --> 20:22.767
Call me. I'm on the plane.

20:25.133 --> 20:25.934
Sorry, dear.

20:28.367 --> 20:31.700
To Blanche Devereaux,
the most wonderful woman in the world.

20:31.767 --> 20:33.300
Now, Richard, you stop that.

20:33.367 --> 20:34.233
No, I mean it.

20:34.667 --> 20:35.800
And my kids agree with me.

20:35.867 --> 20:37.700
They're really crazy about you.

20:38.200 --> 20:39.967
Richard, there's something
I have to ask you.

20:40.033 --> 20:41.500
I have something to ask you, too.

20:41.567 --> 20:42.767
Ok, you first.

20:43.233 --> 20:45.100
Where would you like to go
on our honeymoon?

20:45.567 --> 20:47.800
I thought I'd surprise you
and take you to Paris,

20:47.867 --> 20:49.100
but then I started thinking.

20:49.166 --> 20:50.667
Maybe you don't like Paris.

20:50.734 --> 20:53.500
Maybe you'd rather cruise
to the islands or visit the orient.

20:53.567 --> 20:54.400
Richard.

20:54.867 --> 20:57.767
Oh, I just love the way
that ring looks on you.

20:57.834 --> 20:58.500
(chuckles)

20:59.133 --> 21:00.033
So do I.

21:00.100 --> 21:00.934
Mm.

21:02.533 --> 21:03.834
(sighs)

21:04.400 --> 21:05.867
-Richard...
-Hmm?

21:06.700 --> 21:09.233
You know I am very, very fond of you,

21:10.100 --> 21:12.433
but I think we have a problem.

21:12.500 --> 21:13.367
A problem?

21:14.367 --> 21:15.400
Let's look at it.

21:16.600 --> 21:17.467
(clears throat)

21:17.533 --> 21:19.200
Well, when you first proposed to me,

21:19.266 --> 21:22.633
the thing that scared me the most
was the idea of being a mother again,

21:22.700 --> 21:24.700
especially to such small children.

21:24.767 --> 21:26.066
I wasn't sure I could do it.

21:26.133 --> 21:28.233
In fact, I wasn't sure
I even wanted to do it.

21:28.300 --> 21:33.266
But then I got to know the kids,
and I realized they aren't the issue.

21:34.667 --> 21:36.066
The real problem is...

21:37.867 --> 21:39.433
I'm third in your life.

21:39.500 --> 21:42.100
Richard, you know your work comes first,

21:42.166 --> 21:47.967
then the children, then me,
and that kind of marriage just can't work.

21:48.300 --> 21:49.533
At least, it can't for me.

21:49.600 --> 21:52.000
Blanche, I can be there for all of you.

21:52.734 --> 21:53.667
I can do it.

21:54.266 --> 21:57.200
I've been able to do
about anything I set my mind to.

21:57.266 --> 21:59.200
I know I can do this, too.

21:59.266 --> 22:01.533
Richard, nobody can do it all.

22:01.600 --> 22:05.867
Now, as well as I get along
with those kids, they need you.

22:06.333 --> 22:08.900
They're growing up without you,
Richard, and it's hurting 'em.

22:09.600 --> 22:13.900
Right now, the most important thing
should be the children, not...

22:15.166 --> 22:18.500
Not getting married
and not Gresham on the coast

22:18.567 --> 22:21.567
and not trying to squeeze in a week
for a honeymoon.

22:22.433 --> 22:26.867
Oh, this is the hardest thing
I've ever tried to say to anybody.

22:28.767 --> 22:29.967
You can't marry me.

22:32.033 --> 22:34.367
Not now, not yet.

22:34.934 --> 22:37.000
Listen, why don't you call up the kids

22:37.066 --> 22:39.467
and tell 'em they're spending tonight
with their daddy?

22:40.066 --> 22:42.400
And then, after a while,

22:42.467 --> 22:45.100
if you still want to be a husband,
why, you just...

22:46.300 --> 22:47.333
You let me know.

22:48.867 --> 22:49.567
Bye.

22:56.834 --> 22:59.834
(mellow music playing)

23:03.200 --> 23:05.233
Dorothy, do you want to do the honors?

23:05.300 --> 23:07.433
Maybe later. In private.

23:08.500 --> 23:11.333
I mean fasten the floor flange.
That's all we have left to do.

23:11.400 --> 23:12.800
No, honey, you go ahead.

23:12.867 --> 23:15.834
Later, I'll break a bottle of champagne
over the flush valve.

23:16.967 --> 23:19.767
Oh, girls, it is beautiful!
I'm so proud of you!

23:19.834 --> 23:20.767
Thanks, Blanche.

23:20.834 --> 23:22.000
Hey, are you going out?

23:22.066 --> 23:23.734
-Yes.
-Ah, I'm glad.

23:23.800 --> 23:25.934
You know, we've been so worried about you.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.834
Well, I guess you can cry just so long
and eat just so much.

23:28.900 --> 23:31.900
Then you have to pull yourself together
and get on with your life.

23:31.967 --> 23:33.266
Besides, there'll be other Richards.

23:33.734 --> 23:37.667
'Course, they won't be as charming
or as handsome or as rich.

23:38.166 --> 23:40.567
I'd better stop.
I'm starting to depress myself again.

23:41.667 --> 23:43.133
Sophia, look.

23:43.200 --> 23:44.867
Isn't it wonderful? What do you think?

23:45.333 --> 23:46.900
Looks like a bathroom.

23:47.433 --> 23:49.600
A bathroom that works!

23:49.667 --> 23:52.100
And you were so sure
that we couldn't do it ourselves.

23:52.166 --> 23:53.533
Watch. Girls, come on.

23:53.600 --> 23:56.233
1, 2, 3!

23:57.433 --> 24:01.433
(cheering)

24:04.633 --> 24:06.667
Knock it off. It's water, not oil.

24:08.667 --> 24:12.633
(lively music playing)

24:14.400 --> 24:17.400
(closing theme music playing)
