WEBVTT

01:36.430 --> 01:37.741
For hundreds of years,

01:37.765 --> 01:39.343
people have come to our village

01:39.367 --> 01:42.102
trying to solve
the mystery of the loch.

01:42.970 --> 01:45.182
Dr. Abernathy
was one of them,

01:45.206 --> 01:48.041
until the night
he had a terrible accident.

01:49.443 --> 01:50.920
We didn't know it then,

01:50.944 --> 01:54.114
but that night was going to
change our lives forever.

01:58.018 --> 02:00.154
Izzie, bedtime!

02:12.233 --> 02:14.611
Was that a good one?
Oh, very good one, that.

02:14.635 --> 02:16.704
The one-eye, that's the one.

02:17.705 --> 02:19.115
Yeah!

02:19.139 --> 02:20.674
Nice one there.

02:24.178 --> 02:26.623
Are you all right,
Dr. Abernathy?

02:26.647 --> 02:27.991
Dr. Abernathy,
are you all right?

02:28.015 --> 02:30.126
Yeah, yeah,
I just need some air,

02:30.150 --> 02:31.652
clear my head.

03:35.816 --> 03:37.084
Oh, my God.

04:02.476 --> 04:04.177
It's the first
day of the rest of your life!

04:22.930 --> 04:24.264
It's bleeding again.

04:35.609 --> 04:37.778
Right here is good for me.

04:39.613 --> 04:41.525
Uh, yeah, listen,

04:41.549 --> 04:43.427
why don't you tell Eddie
down at the shop

04:43.451 --> 04:46.496
I'll catch up with him
later, all right? Eddie?

04:46.520 --> 04:48.356
Yeah, Eddie. He's the
owner of the place.

04:48.956 --> 04:51.267
We have no Eddie.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.561
All his close friends
call him Eddie.

04:54.294 --> 04:55.329
He's my brother.

04:58.031 --> 04:59.343
You're not listening to me.

04:59.367 --> 05:00.844
Hey, Caroline...

05:00.868 --> 05:04.781
Yoo-hoo, Caroline.
You will get your money.

05:04.805 --> 05:06.340
I...

05:10.811 --> 05:12.188
You look like hell.

05:12.212 --> 05:13.457
Thank you very much.

05:13.481 --> 05:15.816
Aren't you supposed to be
at a class right now?

05:16.417 --> 05:17.685
Probably.

05:18.852 --> 05:20.864
You know, Mercer is
going ballistic.

05:20.888 --> 05:22.966
He wants to have a word with
you after your next lecture.

05:22.990 --> 05:25.258
You know, the one you're not at.

05:27.428 --> 05:29.830
The dean doesn't want you
around the campus.

05:32.099 --> 05:33.534
Neither do I.

05:36.036 --> 05:39.239
However, all is not lost.

05:41.241 --> 05:45.178
I have a research position that's
perfect for a man of your reputation.

05:46.680 --> 05:47.881
Loch Ness.

05:49.883 --> 05:50.994
What?

05:51.018 --> 05:52.219
Loch Ness, Scotland.

05:54.688 --> 05:58.001
I sent Dr. Abernathy. He
had an accident. Dead.

05:58.025 --> 05:59.503
What's his name is still there.

05:59.527 --> 06:01.037
His research assistant,
Adrian somebody.

06:01.061 --> 06:03.673
You want me to go find
the Loch Ness monster?

06:03.697 --> 06:05.108
Is that what you're
offering me, Bob?

06:05.132 --> 06:09.413
No, John, I want you to go to Loch
Ness and not find the monster.

06:09.437 --> 06:11.515
I want you to take this
state-of-the-art equipment

06:11.539 --> 06:13.583
and prove that it's the
biggest hoax of the century.

06:13.607 --> 06:15.419
What are you doing?
You know, you just...

06:15.443 --> 06:18.045
You're stickin' another
nail in my coffin.

06:19.613 --> 06:21.024
I can't go there!

06:21.048 --> 06:24.360
It'll look like I'm... Like I'm
running after another shadow!

06:24.384 --> 06:27.030
The only reason I'm teaching
freshmen in the first place

06:27.054 --> 06:30.233
is because I chased a no-show
monster for three years!

06:30.257 --> 06:31.635
You know that!

06:31.659 --> 06:34.237
Come on, I won't have any
credibility left at all.

06:34.261 --> 06:36.573
You don't have any credibility.

06:36.597 --> 06:38.331
And now you don't
have any career.

06:39.066 --> 06:40.744
Unless I say so.

06:40.768 --> 06:42.045
What's the problem here?

06:42.069 --> 06:44.581
All you have to do is
run the sonar up the loch,

06:44.605 --> 06:47.417
bring me definitive evidence
that nothing's there,

06:47.441 --> 06:48.718
and then I get
my equipment back,

06:48.742 --> 06:50.219
you regain some credibility,

06:50.243 --> 06:51.387
and you get paid, John.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.413
Screw the money.
I won't do it.

06:54.915 --> 06:57.317
That's brave talk for a guy that
has to hitchhike home tonight.

06:58.118 --> 06:59.319
Mmm-mmm.

07:04.091 --> 07:05.735
You know, John,

07:05.759 --> 07:08.596
I've got letters on my desk
from the IRS about you.

07:09.830 --> 07:11.475
Not to mention communications

07:11.499 --> 07:13.366
from the lawyers
of your ex-wife.

07:15.469 --> 07:17.681
You know, I may be broke

07:17.705 --> 07:19.583
and I may not have
any credibility left,

07:19.607 --> 07:21.785
but I do have some dignity.

07:21.809 --> 07:23.352
That's blackmail, you know that?

07:23.376 --> 07:25.421
So why don't you just

07:25.445 --> 07:27.180
take the whole loch
and shove it?

07:36.389 --> 07:38.502
Ah.

07:38.526 --> 07:42.338
Uh, Helen, make that
reservation for Scotland

07:42.362 --> 07:45.475
for Dr. John Dempsey,
Jonathan Dempsey.

07:45.499 --> 07:48.344
Yeah, in coach, of course.

07:48.368 --> 07:49.870
I don't know.
Hold on.

07:51.071 --> 07:52.540
John, window or aisle?

07:54.474 --> 07:55.676
Window.

07:56.009 --> 07:57.010
Window.

08:21.068 --> 08:23.046
Dr. Dempsey?

08:23.070 --> 08:24.738
Hello, I'm Adrian Foote.

08:25.505 --> 08:27.007
Your research assistant?

08:32.179 --> 08:34.023
Oh.

08:34.047 --> 08:37.561
I recognize you from that
picture in Time magazine

08:37.585 --> 08:39.261
when you were on the
boat in Madagascar

08:39.285 --> 08:42.097
with the lemur on your shoulder.
Remember?

08:42.121 --> 08:43.499
You've lost a bit of
weight since then, sir,

08:43.523 --> 08:45.525
if you don't mind me
saying so. It suits you.

08:46.860 --> 08:49.405
This is an honor for me.

08:49.429 --> 08:51.732
I've read all your
books on biodiversity.

08:54.902 --> 08:56.103
Loch Ness.

08:56.570 --> 08:57.781
In 500 AD,

08:57.805 --> 09:00.917
St. Columba saw the beastie
approaching a swimmer.

09:00.941 --> 09:03.920
"Turn back, beastie, let the man
be!" he's reported to have shouted.

09:03.944 --> 09:05.121
It submerged.

09:07.715 --> 09:11.360
Ever since then, people have
been seeing each uisage,

09:11.384 --> 09:13.486
that's the horse of the water.

09:21.729 --> 09:23.731
But you watch out, beastie,

09:24.798 --> 09:26.333
'cause your man is here.

09:33.774 --> 09:37.053
It is.
It's very comfortable.

09:37.077 --> 09:39.723
And each room is done out
in a different tartan.

09:39.747 --> 09:41.448
I think mine's Hunting Stewart.

09:45.753 --> 09:48.898
Is there another hotel
we can go to?

09:48.922 --> 09:51.467
Not that's open now.
It's after the season.

09:51.491 --> 09:53.302
Sounds like the ceilidh's
in high gear, so...

09:53.326 --> 09:56.105
Wait, wait, wait.
What's a "ceilidh"?

09:56.129 --> 09:59.132
Well, it's a gathering in honor
of all the cryptozoologists.

10:00.934 --> 10:04.080
You're telling me there are
Nessie hunters in there?

10:04.104 --> 10:05.749
Aye, I thought you knew.

10:05.773 --> 10:08.084
They're all very excited
at a chance to meet you.

10:08.108 --> 10:10.186
Didn't Dr. Mercer tell you?

10:10.210 --> 10:14.181
Oh... Oh, that's perfect.

10:16.116 --> 10:17.217
Good.

10:27.160 --> 10:29.538
The Danes are here, too.
They're building a giant cage.

10:29.562 --> 10:32.299
They plan to lure Nessie in
with six tons of breadcrumbs.

10:38.872 --> 10:40.684
Dr. Muller?
Dr. Muller.

10:40.708 --> 10:42.151
Adrian.

10:42.175 --> 10:45.388
Dempsey. The John Dempsey, as in Dr.
Sasquatch.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.291
I think they were
wrong about you.

10:48.315 --> 10:51.060
He also discovered and classified an
unknown species of wasp in South America.

10:51.084 --> 10:52.361
That's all right.

10:52.385 --> 10:54.497
Won the Tyler Award for that
when he was 26 years old.

10:54.521 --> 10:56.199
Extraordinary. He's won
the NSA Award twice.

10:56.223 --> 10:58.334
That was a long time ago. Forget about it.
Everyone else has.

10:58.358 --> 11:01.738
I read the article about you
in Scientific American.

11:01.762 --> 11:03.006
I think they
were wrong, because...

11:03.030 --> 11:05.341
Dr. Dempsey,
such an honor.

11:05.365 --> 11:07.210
Your pursuit
of the yeti was seminal.

11:07.234 --> 11:08.311
Mmm.

11:08.335 --> 11:10.814
Tell me, what is your
method of tracking?

11:10.838 --> 11:12.982
My method of tracking?
Well...

11:13.006 --> 11:15.685
See, what I like to do is
locate what I'm after,

11:15.709 --> 11:17.653
then I kind of bend
down here like this,

11:17.677 --> 11:20.948
and then I give it
the old zigzag here...

11:26.419 --> 11:28.898
There is nowhere you can go.

11:28.922 --> 11:31.334
I'm gonna get my rig, do my job

11:31.358 --> 11:33.260
and get the hell out of Dodge.

11:34.862 --> 11:37.841
But at least let me drive...
Hey, Adrian,

11:37.865 --> 11:41.101
chill out, all right? Have some
shortbread or something. Here.

11:58.451 --> 12:00.120
Damn midget's car.

12:29.449 --> 12:31.151
Your car is in the drive.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.286
Shoot.

12:33.821 --> 12:35.131
Oh, no.

12:39.292 --> 12:41.494
You realize you're
blocking the driveway?

12:44.364 --> 12:45.474
I do now.

12:45.498 --> 12:47.811
Well, what do you
intend to do about it?

12:47.835 --> 12:49.245
What do you want me
to do about it?

12:49.269 --> 12:50.838
Move it, obviously.

12:53.941 --> 12:55.943
Did I hear the word
"please" in there?

12:59.346 --> 13:00.656
I guess not.

13:08.355 --> 13:09.789
Thanks for your help.

13:15.128 --> 13:18.107
This is a very important
scientific project.

13:18.131 --> 13:20.043
We've a schedule.

13:20.067 --> 13:21.377
If we find something
living down there,

13:21.401 --> 13:23.046
it's gonna be very good
for your business!

13:23.070 --> 13:24.804
Aye, and what if they don't?

13:29.476 --> 13:31.044
This is Dr. Dempsey.

13:32.913 --> 13:34.481
Is that a fact?

13:35.682 --> 13:37.985
So, Doctor...

13:39.352 --> 13:41.221
You want to find
the monster, do you?

13:42.155 --> 13:45.201
Yeah... Yeah,
that's correct.

13:45.225 --> 13:46.535
But I don't have
much time, you know.

13:46.559 --> 13:49.873
I gotta get up to Greenland before
winter hits, find Santa Claus.

13:49.897 --> 13:51.231
Excuse me.

13:53.833 --> 13:55.335
So how much for the boat?

13:56.336 --> 13:59.682
Well, I cannot have her
defaced, you see,

13:59.706 --> 14:03.152
with all this, uh,
equipment I see here.

14:03.176 --> 14:05.445
That'll make
a difference again, so...

14:07.347 --> 14:09.016
I'll be wantin' £20,000.

14:10.683 --> 14:11.760
Then I'll buy it back in a week,

14:11.784 --> 14:14.163
less damages and 500 a day.

14:14.187 --> 14:16.665
£20,000? You said 10.

14:16.689 --> 14:19.126
Oh, aye. That was for
the Conquest there.

14:21.594 --> 14:25.574
Well, I only got a week
and I do need a rig.

14:25.598 --> 14:28.701
Plus I love what you've done
with the colors. Check okay?

14:33.706 --> 14:35.184
Wait, wait, wait.

14:35.208 --> 14:36.852
You can't pay him
all that money.

14:36.876 --> 14:38.521
Well, I'm not going to, am I?

14:38.545 --> 14:41.090
Mercer is. Didn't he tell
you, "Spare no expense"?

14:41.114 --> 14:42.782
Take care of that, will you?

15:37.537 --> 15:40.307
Ah! Did you come to stay with us, Dr.
Dempsey?

15:42.809 --> 15:45.112
I don't know.
Who are you?

15:45.812 --> 15:48.257
Isabel Mary McFetridge.

15:48.281 --> 15:50.659
My mother's Laura
and my dog's Bruce.

15:50.683 --> 15:52.219
He rolled in some fish
and went home.

15:54.821 --> 15:56.456
You'll be in Room D.
Bye for now.

15:57.457 --> 15:58.491
Oh!

16:00.393 --> 16:02.795
Room D.

16:27.520 --> 16:28.521
Hello?

16:29.656 --> 16:30.857
Hello?

16:41.168 --> 16:42.502
They open?

16:51.178 --> 16:52.421
Hello?

16:53.546 --> 16:54.881
Hello?

16:59.786 --> 17:01.121
Hello?

17:02.189 --> 17:04.666
Oh! Sorry. I'm sorry.

17:04.691 --> 17:06.868
Uh... I'm sorry.

17:06.893 --> 17:09.204
I'm looking for a room
for five days.

17:09.229 --> 17:10.506
The season's ended.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.432
We're not taking guests
just now.

17:13.366 --> 17:15.078
Oh.

17:15.102 --> 17:18.114
Well, can I...
Can I see the manager?

17:18.137 --> 17:19.771
I am the manager.

17:21.574 --> 17:22.785
Could I...

17:22.809 --> 17:24.752
Could I talk to the owner?

17:24.777 --> 17:26.413
I am the owner.
Uh-huh.

17:27.814 --> 17:30.383
Bruce got into some
dead fish on the jetty.

17:31.050 --> 17:32.795
He likes to roll in it.

17:32.819 --> 17:36.556
Canis Lupus courtship behavior.
Bruce is on the make.

17:41.594 --> 17:43.906
Are you still blocking
people's driveways?

17:43.930 --> 17:46.709
Yeah, I'm sorry...
Hello?

17:46.733 --> 17:49.212
You caught me off guard.

17:49.236 --> 17:52.081
The little girl said that you
were holding a room for me.

17:52.105 --> 17:53.216
Isabel?

17:53.240 --> 17:55.784
Oh, she's a wee lass,
Mr. Dempsey.

17:55.808 --> 17:57.777
We're not accommodating.

17:59.011 --> 18:00.656
Right. Uh...

18:00.680 --> 18:01.757
Well, let me ask you, ma'am,

18:01.781 --> 18:03.759
when you are accommodating,

18:03.783 --> 18:05.285
what do you usually
get for a room?

18:07.120 --> 18:08.321
£70 a night.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.238
Well, let's make it 75,

18:15.262 --> 18:17.997
and I apologize for
blocking your driveway.

18:19.266 --> 18:22.278
I'm sorry,
but we're still closed.

18:22.302 --> 18:24.847
Hey, please. Listen,
this is the only place.

18:24.871 --> 18:27.250
Just for five nights, please.

18:27.274 --> 18:28.941
So you'll be
another beastie hunter?

18:30.777 --> 18:32.355
Yes. Yes, ma'am.

18:32.379 --> 18:34.457
Have net, will travel.
That's me.

18:34.481 --> 18:37.526
£80. Please,
come on, overcharge me.

18:37.550 --> 18:39.686
It seems to be the national
pastime around here.

18:40.820 --> 18:42.555
Hello, Mr. Dempsey.

18:43.323 --> 18:45.168
Isabel.

18:45.192 --> 18:48.604
Hey, listen, why don't you
work out a room deal with me?

18:48.628 --> 18:49.772
Your mom's crucifying me.

18:49.796 --> 18:50.939
How much are you offering?

18:50.963 --> 18:52.475
Isabel!

18:52.499 --> 18:54.843
Well, all right.
This is my last offer, though.

18:54.867 --> 18:57.570
£90 and no pets in my room.

18:59.639 --> 19:00.816
That's really good.

19:00.840 --> 19:01.841
Oh, gee!

19:02.309 --> 19:03.343
Yeah, see?

19:05.245 --> 19:07.022
All right.

19:07.046 --> 19:08.557
Room D.
It's along the landing.

19:08.581 --> 19:09.625
Yes!

19:09.649 --> 19:10.726
Come on, Isabel.

19:10.750 --> 19:12.051
Hey, look at that.
Room D.

19:13.353 --> 19:14.821
Oh, hey, could you...

19:15.755 --> 19:17.690
No, you're too late
for breakfast.

19:19.526 --> 19:20.969
Three of these, laddie,

19:20.993 --> 19:24.039
and you might catch
a glimpse of the beastie.

19:24.063 --> 19:26.699
I think I got a pretty good
look at one, don't you?

19:27.400 --> 19:28.677
Some carrots.

19:28.701 --> 19:30.813
Yeah. How many
would you like?

19:30.837 --> 19:33.340
How about four?
Four. For soup.

19:36.075 --> 19:39.246
They laughed at the very
idea of a dragon in Komodo.

19:39.912 --> 19:41.348
And then they found it.

19:44.684 --> 19:46.453
Same with the tree kangaroo.

19:49.188 --> 19:50.757
Right over here.

19:53.360 --> 19:54.527
Yeah.

19:56.028 --> 19:58.030
Same with the mega shark,
of course.

20:02.635 --> 20:04.804
And it was the same
with your discovery, huh?

20:05.305 --> 20:06.706
The Dempsey wasp.

20:14.914 --> 20:16.359
Satellite mapping system?

20:17.784 --> 20:19.862
And that's CP500 sonar!

20:19.886 --> 20:22.365
I thought only the military
has this kind of equipment.

20:22.389 --> 20:25.392
Well, nothing's too good
for Mercer's army.

20:27.594 --> 20:28.871
Beer?

20:28.895 --> 20:31.564
No, thanks.
Right. Right.

21:23.550 --> 21:25.284
You can see every mollusk.

21:26.218 --> 21:28.120
You can see every inch.

21:32.058 --> 21:33.560
We're gonna see it.

21:34.293 --> 21:35.695
I know it.

21:37.797 --> 21:39.366
How can it not be there?

21:40.299 --> 21:42.134
How can what
not be there, Adrian?

21:44.871 --> 21:46.373
The creature.

21:49.976 --> 21:52.388
You know,

21:52.412 --> 21:56.392
in prehistoric times, the loch was
connected to the sea duct a bit.

21:56.416 --> 21:58.527
It was cut off at some point
during the second ice age.

21:58.551 --> 22:00.696
Now any aquatic dinosaur
living here would have been...

22:00.720 --> 22:03.732
Trapped in an isolated aquarium,

22:03.756 --> 22:07.326
able to sustain itself
and escape extinction.

22:08.395 --> 22:10.305
It's a nice theory.

22:10.329 --> 22:12.408
Oh, come on, man.

22:12.432 --> 22:14.901
We get the Discovery Channel
too, you know.

22:17.704 --> 22:19.848
Look, I don't want
to seem impertinent, Doctor,

22:21.240 --> 22:25.153
but sometimes it sounds like you
believe there's nothing there.

22:25.177 --> 22:27.013
Oh, you're in
the ballpark there.

22:28.848 --> 22:30.659
Okay, so the locals
need a legend

22:30.683 --> 22:32.661
because their livelihood
depends on it,

22:32.685 --> 22:34.353
but what about the evidence?

22:36.188 --> 22:40.335
It's a large pinniped.
It may be a Pleistocene relic.

22:40.359 --> 22:44.740
I believe strongly, Doctor, that what's
down here is not a tabloid monster.

22:44.764 --> 22:46.509
It's a biological phenomenon.

22:46.533 --> 22:48.034
Come on.

22:49.536 --> 22:52.038
Oh, would you give me a break?

23:02.148 --> 23:03.550
Dr. Dempsey!

23:05.084 --> 23:07.386
Nothing on the rear
scanner, Adrian!

23:09.922 --> 23:12.635
No, there's...
There's something here.

23:12.659 --> 23:14.393
I need help to get a fix on it.

23:17.063 --> 23:21.043
It's nothing. Probably just a
chunk of driftwood or something.

23:21.067 --> 23:24.303
Uh-uh, it's too big
to be a chunk of driftwood.

23:25.638 --> 23:27.149
It's moving.

23:27.173 --> 23:28.451
It's moving!

23:28.475 --> 23:31.478
It's propelled by trapped
bacterial gas. Relax.

23:37.283 --> 23:39.586
There, see? I told you.
It was just a log.

23:42.121 --> 23:44.090
It's always just a big damn log.

23:48.094 --> 23:49.137
I'm sorry.

23:49.161 --> 23:51.498
<i>♪ Waves without wind</i>

23:52.499 --> 23:54.934
<i>♪ Fish without fin</i>

23:55.434 --> 23:56.912
I'm so sorry.

23:56.936 --> 24:01.508
<i>♪ And a floating island...</i>

24:03.342 --> 24:07.547
Each uisage!
Each uisage!

24:11.383 --> 24:15.664
He's the water bailiff.
The keeper of the loch.

24:15.688 --> 24:17.890
He's been here since '32.

24:25.898 --> 24:28.443
<i>♪ Row, row, row your boat</i>

24:28.467 --> 24:30.302
<i>♪ Gently down the stream</i>

24:31.704 --> 24:34.306
<i>♪ Merrily, merrily
Merrily, merrily</i>

24:36.142 --> 24:38.144
<i>♪ Life is but a dream</i>

25:14.747 --> 25:17.116
Dinner is at 7:30, sharp.

25:17.850 --> 25:19.327
That'll be extra, of course.

25:19.351 --> 25:20.829
Of course.

25:20.853 --> 25:23.590
I suppose the breakfast I didn't have
is included in the price, right?

25:23.856 --> 25:24.857
Aye.

25:25.524 --> 25:26.759
Well, that makes sense.

25:28.294 --> 25:29.504
How's your room?

25:29.528 --> 25:31.598
Uh, it's nice, yes.
Very nice.

25:35.602 --> 25:38.270
Are you taking over
from poor Dr. Abernathy?

25:38.971 --> 25:40.783
Yeah, I suppose I am.

25:40.807 --> 25:44.753
Ah, he was a good man.
Such a tragedy.

25:44.777 --> 25:47.279
So you're here to solve
the mystery of the loch?

25:48.615 --> 25:50.425
There's no mystery to solve.

25:50.449 --> 25:52.218
Oh, I don't know about that.

25:54.453 --> 25:56.632
You're a believer?

25:56.656 --> 25:59.158
Well, I wouldn't say yes,
but I wouldn't say no.

26:01.227 --> 26:02.762
Oh, come on, you can tell me.

26:03.630 --> 26:05.264
Have you actually seen it?

26:05.898 --> 26:07.275
Well, uh...

26:07.299 --> 26:08.811
When I was a wee girl,

26:08.835 --> 26:11.714
I saw a great wake
in Urquhart Bay.

26:11.738 --> 26:14.106
Three humps came up
just beyond the castle there.

26:14.774 --> 26:16.318
Really?

26:16.342 --> 26:19.178
See, now, that's my personal favorite.
The old triple-humper.

26:21.480 --> 26:24.250
If you don't believe in it,
why did you ask me?

26:28.120 --> 26:29.455
I'm sorry.

26:32.358 --> 26:33.501
Is there a shower?

26:33.525 --> 26:34.603
Aye.

26:34.627 --> 26:36.805
Oh, thank God. I am...

26:36.829 --> 26:38.464
But there's no hot water.

26:39.098 --> 26:40.132
Why not?

26:40.933 --> 26:42.911
The dog used the last of it.

26:42.935 --> 26:44.980
I'm sorry?

26:45.004 --> 26:47.616
Canis Lupus used the
last of the H2O.

26:47.640 --> 26:49.184
He's clean as a whistle now.

26:49.208 --> 26:51.253
Oh, now, wait a minute,
wait a minute here.

26:51.277 --> 26:53.588
Are you telling me that
I'm paying £90 a night,

26:53.612 --> 26:57.192
that's $140, I don't get
the breakfast that I paid for,

26:57.216 --> 26:59.094
and the dog gets my hot water?

26:59.118 --> 27:00.763
I didn't know you were coming

27:00.787 --> 27:02.621
and I didn't ask you to stay.

27:03.990 --> 27:06.702
There'll be plenty
of hot water later.

27:06.726 --> 27:08.003
There are your towels.

27:08.027 --> 27:11.439
Oh, thank you.
Yes, the towels. Yeah.

27:11.463 --> 27:12.841
Oh, yeah.
Ooh, look at these.

27:12.865 --> 27:15.201
Are you sure that they should
be away from their mother?

27:25.311 --> 27:28.214
I've seen the snow
in wintertime, 5'0".

27:29.648 --> 27:32.852
And my old grandpappy, 4'11",

27:34.754 --> 27:36.422
we never saw him till March.

27:39.158 --> 27:40.927
That's terrible.
Except for his hat.

27:43.763 --> 27:46.975
And my old grandmother,
well, she was quite pleased.

27:46.999 --> 27:49.577
I'll help you with that.
Let me help you with that.

27:49.601 --> 27:50.979
I can manage. Thanks.

27:51.003 --> 27:53.816
Sorry. I was only suggesting
that because you're, um,

27:53.840 --> 27:55.818
a woman,
you're not capable of...

27:55.842 --> 27:58.320
I'm sure you're
more than capable of...

27:58.344 --> 27:59.511
As well as being a woman.

28:00.512 --> 28:02.181
Well, if you want to.

28:08.687 --> 28:10.332
What do you think
you're doing, Andy?

28:10.356 --> 28:12.667
Oh, I'm just
pulling one for Duncan

28:12.691 --> 28:14.102
on the self-serve pump.

28:14.126 --> 28:17.039
I'd be obliged if you'd stay
your side of the bar, please.

28:17.063 --> 28:21.443
Oh, oh, I do apologize,
Ms. McFetridge.

28:21.467 --> 28:23.235
Only trying to help, I'm sure.

28:24.370 --> 28:26.072
Have you

28:27.206 --> 28:28.951
thought any more
about what I said?

28:28.975 --> 28:31.310
Oh, I have, and
the answer's still no.

28:34.881 --> 28:37.525
You do not know what
you're missin', Laura.

28:37.549 --> 28:40.052
I've a good idea
and it'll be no loss.

28:44.156 --> 28:47.226
Hello, Mr. Dempsey. Would
you like to sit with me?

28:49.395 --> 28:51.163
Somebody who doesn't
hate me. Wow.

28:53.565 --> 28:55.968
Actually, I'd love to.
Thank you.

28:58.604 --> 29:00.949
So what do you want to do?

29:00.973 --> 29:03.385
You want to go have
a scotch and a cigar?

29:03.409 --> 29:05.477
No. You're funny.

29:06.012 --> 29:07.555
You think so?

29:07.579 --> 29:10.558
Oh, good. Well, you wanna
hear some of my impressions?

29:10.582 --> 29:13.228
I do Donald Duck
and Mickey Mouse.

29:13.252 --> 29:15.330
Here you go. I used
to do a human being,

29:15.354 --> 29:17.156
but I'm a little
out of practice.

29:24.864 --> 29:27.242
You're a great audience.

29:27.266 --> 29:30.669
Okay, smart stuff,
it's your turn.

29:35.875 --> 29:38.453
No, hey, hey, that was good.
That was good.

29:38.477 --> 29:40.923
You're a professional, right?

29:40.947 --> 29:42.324
What else do you do?
Any more animals?

29:42.348 --> 29:44.259
I can do the water kelpie.

29:44.283 --> 29:45.794
Ah, yes, the water kelpie.

29:45.818 --> 29:48.130
All right, go ahead.
Let me see your Nessie.

29:50.957 --> 29:54.803
That's good, but I think it's
actually a little more like this...

30:03.702 --> 30:04.813
You're silly.

30:04.837 --> 30:07.015
It doesn't sound
like that at all.

30:07.039 --> 30:08.316
Oh, great, great.

30:08.340 --> 30:09.708
A little success and all of
a sudden, you're a critic.

30:13.745 --> 30:15.514
There you go, Tommy.

30:19.318 --> 30:20.987
What's his story?

30:22.821 --> 30:27.402
Mr. Dempsey? He's taking
over, like you said.

30:27.426 --> 30:28.971
Aye, and with more equipment

30:28.995 --> 30:30.973
than I've ever seen on the loch.

30:30.997 --> 30:34.042
Aye, but it's strange. He's not
another starry-eyed looney

30:34.066 --> 30:37.145
looking for a monster. The
direct opposite, in fact.

30:37.169 --> 30:39.081
He says it doesn't exist.

30:39.105 --> 30:40.482
How long is he staying?

30:40.506 --> 30:42.584
As long as it takes him
to prove his point.

30:42.608 --> 30:44.076
He thinks five days.

30:48.547 --> 30:50.116
Did he pay in advance?

30:58.925 --> 31:00.626
Bruce, drop!

31:06.865 --> 31:08.100
Fetch it.

31:19.946 --> 31:23.449
Not for Magnus,
not with his coloring.

31:24.550 --> 31:26.728
Good day to you, Laura.
And how are you today?

31:26.752 --> 31:28.696
Oh, not so bad,
Mrs. McFarlane.

31:28.720 --> 31:30.465
Hello, Mrs. Tait.
Laura.

31:30.489 --> 31:32.367
And your lovely
Isabel, is she well?

31:32.391 --> 31:33.601
Fine, fine.

31:33.625 --> 31:36.471
She's becoming quite a
handful these days.

31:36.495 --> 31:37.805
Do you have any
spare milk today?

31:37.829 --> 31:39.065
Yes, yes.

31:42.768 --> 31:44.279
That'll be for the guest,
I suppose.

31:44.303 --> 31:45.447
Aye.

31:45.471 --> 31:47.573
The American. He bought
a bonny pair of socks.

31:48.574 --> 31:52.387
A single man. Very nice,
very good-looking.

31:52.411 --> 31:54.556
I thought you'd closed
for the season.

31:54.580 --> 31:57.749
I had, too. But he made me
an offer I couldn't refuse.

32:00.086 --> 32:02.154
So he'll be staying a time then?

32:02.921 --> 32:04.066
A time, aye.

32:04.090 --> 32:05.757
Is that him out there now?

32:08.160 --> 32:10.405
Heavens, what's he
done to the boat?

32:10.429 --> 32:12.274
Is that some sort of equipment?

32:12.298 --> 32:16.911
Aye. I heard
he had equipment.

32:16.935 --> 32:18.937
MRS. McFARLANE:
It'll be Andy's boat he's using.

32:19.505 --> 32:20.672
It is.

32:21.840 --> 32:24.519
Does Andy not mind you
accommodating?

32:24.543 --> 32:26.112
What's he got to do with it?

32:27.279 --> 32:28.947
Oh, well, nothing. Huh.

32:30.449 --> 32:32.684
Just I heard that you two
had an understanding.

32:33.352 --> 32:35.263
We certainly do not.

32:35.287 --> 32:37.099
And whether or not
I choose to take in guests

32:37.123 --> 32:39.725
has absolutely nothing to do
with Andy Maclean. Thank you.

33:13.325 --> 33:15.403
This loch is 25 miles long.

33:15.427 --> 33:17.805
That's 263 billion
cubic feet of water.

33:17.829 --> 33:21.333
That's more water than all the lakes
in England and Wales put together.

33:23.001 --> 33:24.479
Can't you read?

33:24.503 --> 33:25.713
"Beware"!

33:25.737 --> 33:27.515
"Private"!

33:27.539 --> 33:34.189
Why don't you go and invade a
small country in South America

33:34.213 --> 33:37.159
instead of invading my water,

33:37.183 --> 33:40.952
my privacy and
my monster's privacy?

33:43.355 --> 33:45.291
Did he say his monster?

33:46.425 --> 33:49.571
That's Gordon Shoals.
He's a total fruitcake.

33:49.595 --> 33:51.005
He's been here 16 years now.

33:51.029 --> 33:52.598
Beware the Ides of March,

33:53.265 --> 33:55.877
Dr. John Dempsey!

33:55.901 --> 33:59.081
The water never
gives up its dead!

33:59.105 --> 34:01.916
Yes, I know who you are!

34:01.940 --> 34:04.018
And so does the monster!

34:04.042 --> 34:06.288
And you're in a free country!

34:06.312 --> 34:08.690
The only bit of her
you're gonna see

34:08.714 --> 34:12.025
is the inside of
her bloody stomach!

34:13.918 --> 34:15.563
Because she loves me!
Nutter.

34:15.587 --> 34:17.364
She doesn't love you!

34:17.389 --> 34:18.699
I talk to her!

34:50.522 --> 34:51.757
We got company.

34:52.491 --> 34:54.426
You expecting anybody, Adrian?

35:11.543 --> 35:13.255
What are they doing?

35:13.279 --> 35:14.446
I don't know.

35:18.484 --> 35:20.762
They're gonna hit us.

35:20.786 --> 35:22.388
Get out of the way!
They're gonna hit us.

35:23.722 --> 35:24.790
Hey!

35:55.086 --> 35:56.888
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

36:00.158 --> 36:01.560
They've ruined the whole sweep!

36:36.762 --> 36:38.740
Aye, that's a fact.

36:38.764 --> 36:41.443
Listen, in the old days,

36:41.467 --> 36:44.111
when a man transgressed,

36:44.135 --> 36:46.872
you put him in a barrel
and slid him down the hill.

36:48.106 --> 36:49.717
And when a woman transgressed...

36:49.741 --> 36:53.087
And was it God Almighty himself
deciding the sins, I wonder?

36:53.111 --> 36:55.357
Or maybe some local men
with fish eggs for brains

36:55.381 --> 36:57.559
who acted without thinking?

36:57.583 --> 37:00.295
Don't worry, Laura.
Your business is safe.

37:00.319 --> 37:04.155
So sabotage makes everything just
grand for the community, does it?

37:06.157 --> 37:09.094
And what do you know about
the community, young lady?

37:24.476 --> 37:25.720
Any luck today, Professor?

37:25.744 --> 37:27.813
They tell me you're
the law on the water.

37:28.747 --> 37:31.225
Is that right? Huh?

37:31.249 --> 37:33.419
Do you know what happened
to me out there today?

37:35.086 --> 37:37.332
Caught a cold,
by the sound of it.

37:37.356 --> 37:39.133
Very harsh climate
in these parts.

37:39.157 --> 37:41.403
Yeah, you listen up, Scottie.

37:41.427 --> 37:43.237
Don't think you got
some American patsy

37:43.261 --> 37:44.772
to play highland games with.

37:44.796 --> 37:46.908
I'm not gonna be
run off by a bunch of

37:46.932 --> 37:48.600
tight-fisted weenies in kilts.

37:49.100 --> 37:50.268
You got me?

37:52.037 --> 37:53.848
Well, now you listen to me,

37:53.872 --> 37:57.485
you arrogant
young whippersnapper.

37:57.509 --> 38:00.679
The people you are
speaking of are the Celts.

38:02.113 --> 38:05.451
Hung the heads of their enemies
from the manes of their horses.

38:06.385 --> 38:10.465
You'll never solve
the mystery of the loch.

38:10.489 --> 38:13.435
The Creator made it that way
and it is to stay that way.

38:13.459 --> 38:16.771
The Chamber of Commerce is behind
this racket, Mr. Water Bailiff.

38:16.795 --> 38:19.273
This has nothing to do with creation,
this is all about the economy.

38:19.297 --> 38:23.735
Oh, and what told you that? Your
lenses, your lights, your computers?

38:25.504 --> 38:27.449
Well, I'm not a boastful man,
but I'll tell you something,

38:27.473 --> 38:28.950
I know more about these waters

38:28.974 --> 38:30.976
than any of your machines.

38:32.077 --> 38:33.955
I was baptized in them

38:33.979 --> 38:35.557
and I am the keeper of them.

38:35.581 --> 38:37.124
And I'll tell you
something else.

38:37.148 --> 38:40.395
This mystery goes all the way back to St.
Columba himself,

38:40.419 --> 38:44.231
who saw it and stated it
in the name of Kirk!

38:44.255 --> 38:47.759
Uh, let's see. Would that
be Captain James T. Kirk?

38:53.098 --> 38:55.166
You and your puny machines

38:56.668 --> 39:00.539
will never destroy
1400 years of mystery.

39:02.340 --> 39:04.318
I'll tell you what,

39:04.342 --> 39:06.878
come out on the loch
tomorrow and you watch me.

39:35.206 --> 39:36.942
Good morning.
Let's do it.

39:37.976 --> 39:40.522
Fine. Don't thank us.

39:40.546 --> 39:42.113
We liked being here
since 4:00 this morning.

39:47.385 --> 39:50.698
I'm gonna blow this bull... myth
out of the water once and for all.

39:50.722 --> 39:52.223
It's no myth.
Don't start.

40:33.164 --> 40:35.701
Turn the aperture correction
down to three, please.

40:44.209 --> 40:45.877
He must be halfway up the loch.

40:47.045 --> 40:48.947
I don't think
he's found anything.

40:50.549 --> 40:53.861
I've heard he only eats
the whites of his eggs.

40:53.885 --> 40:55.787
Never touches the yolk.

40:58.123 --> 40:59.767
He walks in his sleep, you know.

40:59.791 --> 41:00.835
No?

41:00.859 --> 41:01.860
Aye?

41:03.194 --> 41:06.040
A lot of Americans do that.

41:06.064 --> 41:07.866
And he sleeps in the nude.

41:27.753 --> 41:30.388
Maybe the sonar activity
has driven it to the far end.

41:31.857 --> 41:33.400
I mean...

41:33.424 --> 41:35.561
Maybe we've got it cornered.

42:39.057 --> 42:40.458
End of loch.

42:47.398 --> 42:49.635
End of the Loch Ness monster.

42:58.143 --> 42:59.510
It's over, Adrian.

43:12.323 --> 43:15.336
If you want to know
what all that means,

43:15.360 --> 43:17.328
it's time to rewrite your
guidebooks, Water Bailiff.

43:30.642 --> 43:32.920
The computer...

43:32.944 --> 43:35.757
The printouts show
cracks alongside the loch.

43:35.781 --> 43:37.358
Something could have been
hiding in there.

43:37.382 --> 43:41.528
Oh, come on, Adrian. If there's a
30-foot dinosaur out in the water,

43:41.552 --> 43:42.930
don't you think
we would have seen it?

43:42.954 --> 43:44.799
But too many people
have testified!

43:44.823 --> 43:47.601
Priests and policemen!
Ten thousand others.

43:47.625 --> 43:49.270
You think that's some sort
of mass hallucination?

43:49.294 --> 43:51.773
That's not my problem.
I did my job as ordered.

43:51.797 --> 43:54.608
I proved it wasn't there.
Signed, sealed and delivered.

43:54.632 --> 43:58.312
So it's over then, huh?
Because you say it is?

43:58.336 --> 43:59.847
What would you know
about it anymore?

43:59.871 --> 44:01.683
You'll not find a dinosaur in
the bottom of a whiskey glass!

44:01.707 --> 44:02.850
Listen to me...

44:02.874 --> 44:05.186
No, no, no, you listen
to me, Dr. Negativity!

44:05.210 --> 44:06.654
I don't know
what you're doing here,

44:06.678 --> 44:09.190
but you're not fit to shine
the shoes of Dr. Abernathy!

44:09.214 --> 44:11.392
"You cannot find something
you don't want to"!

44:11.416 --> 44:13.027
Huh? You remember
those words?

44:13.051 --> 44:16.154
Dr. Dempsey, you should, because
you wrote them nine years ago!

44:20.391 --> 44:21.803
Shit.

44:21.827 --> 44:23.705
Hey, come here,
let me tell you something.

44:23.729 --> 44:24.839
Hey, you want to
yell at me, that's fine...

44:24.863 --> 44:26.573
You want me to yell
at you some more?

44:26.597 --> 44:27.842
That's fine, because
I'm not finished with you!

44:27.866 --> 44:29.210
Hey, let me just say
something first, will you?

44:29.234 --> 44:32.146
I've been here, Adrian,
I did this.

44:32.170 --> 44:36.217
I'm the guy who blew his reputation
chasing Sasquatch, remember?

44:36.241 --> 44:39.186
British Columbia, 1986?
You found the tracks!

44:39.210 --> 44:41.155
You still don't get it, do you?

44:41.179 --> 44:42.389
I am a joke.

44:42.413 --> 44:44.491
I'm the guy
who chases looney tunes.

44:44.515 --> 44:46.517
And you think I don't want
to find something out there?

44:50.521 --> 44:53.667
If I nailed a dinosaur
in Loch Ness,

44:53.691 --> 44:56.938
I would be vindicated
1,000 times over.

44:56.962 --> 44:58.629
I would have it all back.

44:59.364 --> 45:00.531
And more.

45:03.201 --> 45:05.546
But it's not gonna happen.
There's nothing down there.

45:05.570 --> 45:07.581
There's nothing
up in British Columbia.

45:07.605 --> 45:10.617
There's nothing unexplained
flying around the skies at night.

45:10.641 --> 45:12.954
That is just
a wish list, Adrian,

45:12.978 --> 45:15.189
to make us feel like
there's something more to life

45:15.213 --> 45:16.782
than the shit we got stuck with.

45:20.051 --> 45:22.053
Believing is not enough.

45:25.123 --> 45:26.792
Don't make
the same mistake I did.

45:35.934 --> 45:38.212
Will you sit down, Izzie?
Come on.

45:38.236 --> 45:40.214
I'm just not comfortable at all.

45:40.238 --> 45:42.573
But you have a cushion,
so you should be.

45:44.575 --> 45:45.944
Is there any napkins?

45:48.113 --> 45:50.224
Tomorrow, I'll get some
napkins, I promise.

45:50.248 --> 45:52.559
Promise?
I promise.

45:52.583 --> 45:54.929
I'll get it tomorrow. What
else do we have to get? Milk.

45:54.953 --> 45:56.831
Mmm-hmm.
Biscuits.

45:56.855 --> 45:58.833
Pota... Potatoes.

45:58.857 --> 46:00.425
Potatoes.

46:15.841 --> 46:18.009
You look sad, Mr.
Dempsey.

46:19.945 --> 46:22.123
My mommy asked if you'd
like to come in over

46:22.147 --> 46:24.191
and have dinner with us
before you leave.

46:24.215 --> 46:26.284
Would you like to come
and have dinner with us?

46:28.954 --> 46:30.621
This is very nice.

46:32.023 --> 46:33.458
Mr. Dempsey?

46:35.961 --> 46:39.506
Uh... Isabel said
that you were...

46:39.530 --> 46:41.232
You were expecting me
to join you for dinner.

46:43.334 --> 46:46.304
Right, right.
Yeah, of course.

46:47.238 --> 46:48.515
Maybe I misunderstood.

46:48.539 --> 46:51.118
I tell you... Why don't I just
take this upstairs and...

46:51.142 --> 46:53.578
No, no, no. I wouldn't
hear of it, honestly.

47:00.318 --> 47:02.229
Is there anything wrong with it?

47:02.253 --> 47:03.530
You've hardly touched it.

47:03.554 --> 47:06.824
No, no, it's wonderful. It's
just, uh, I wasn't very hungry.

47:08.059 --> 47:09.327
Mmm. Mmm.

47:13.064 --> 47:14.699
Have you finished on the loch?

47:15.666 --> 47:17.368
Yeah. Yeah,
I've finished.

47:21.106 --> 47:23.541
How come you didn't come
on holiday with your wife?

47:24.075 --> 47:25.276
Isabel!

47:26.177 --> 47:27.845
That's all right.

47:28.679 --> 47:30.657
Number one, I'm not on holiday,

47:30.681 --> 47:32.526
and number two,
I don't have a wife.

47:32.550 --> 47:34.519
Never?
Izzie!

47:35.520 --> 47:36.787
No, I did once.

47:37.422 --> 47:39.000
She ran off?

47:39.024 --> 47:41.568
Yeah, she ran off.

47:41.592 --> 47:43.204
Weren't you really nice to her?

47:43.228 --> 47:45.339
Isabel Mary McFetridge!

47:45.363 --> 47:49.443
As a matter of fact, when I wasn't in
the jungle, I was very nice to her.

47:49.467 --> 47:52.279
I even discovered a new species
and named it after her.

47:52.303 --> 47:54.781
Is that true?
What did you discover?

47:54.805 --> 47:56.450
A parasitic wasp.

47:56.474 --> 47:57.885
A wasp!

47:57.909 --> 48:00.621
I named it Protus Carolinus.

48:02.213 --> 48:04.058
The resemblance was uncanny.

48:04.082 --> 48:07.394
You laugh now, but I tell you,
this was one very dangerous wasp.

48:07.418 --> 48:09.730
After it stings you,
it hires a lawyer.

48:18.096 --> 48:19.931
Oh, well, the pub's open.

48:21.432 --> 48:24.378
Finish up as you like.
I'll clean it off later.

48:24.402 --> 48:26.604
Well, yes, thank you
very much for dinner.

48:31.509 --> 48:33.178
She's lonely, too.

48:35.746 --> 48:38.559
The winds whistled
down the glens

48:38.583 --> 48:41.519
at 150 miles an hour.
150!

48:42.920 --> 48:47.101
My uncle, Donald, he had one
ear bigger than the other,

48:47.125 --> 48:49.270
and when the winds blew,

48:49.294 --> 48:52.297
it would corkscrew him
down into the ground.

48:53.298 --> 48:55.266
Your good health, sir.
Your good health.

48:55.967 --> 48:58.245
Stuart, the same?

48:58.269 --> 49:00.771
Hello there, Adrian.
What can I get you?

49:02.207 --> 49:05.510
Nothing, thank you very much.
I'm... I'm all right.

49:08.613 --> 49:11.358
Could I just say
that you are looking

49:11.382 --> 49:12.859
particularly lovely
this evening?

49:12.883 --> 49:14.385
Thank you.

49:18.789 --> 49:19.933
Will you marry me?

49:19.957 --> 49:21.326
Oh, no!

49:22.527 --> 49:24.105
Not tonight.

49:24.129 --> 49:27.132
Besides, I make it a rule never to
marry anyone who asks me in a bar.

49:27.965 --> 49:30.301
Oh, very wise.

49:30.535 --> 49:32.346
Mmm.

49:32.370 --> 49:36.017
Well, perhaps you wouldn't mind

49:36.041 --> 49:37.351
passing these on
to Dr. Dempsey

49:37.375 --> 49:39.153
to take back
to America with him.

49:39.177 --> 49:41.655
The hotel still had
a few of Dr. Abernathy's...

49:41.679 --> 49:44.082
Of course I will. But if you
want him, he's in the kitchen.

49:45.216 --> 49:48.029
Um, no, thanks,
I think I've had quite enough

49:48.053 --> 49:50.988
of the great and world-famous
Dr. Dinky for the moment.

49:52.023 --> 49:53.467
I have everything
you wanted, yes.

49:53.491 --> 49:55.636
I have the photos,
I have printouts,

49:55.660 --> 49:57.695
I have sonar readings,
the works.

50:00.031 --> 50:01.766
Yes. Yes, I realize that.

50:03.268 --> 50:05.179
I won.
Yes, I will.

50:05.203 --> 50:07.538
I will see you
in Los Angeles tomorrow.

50:08.073 --> 50:09.340
Right.

50:10.508 --> 50:11.918
How do you do that?

50:11.942 --> 50:14.888
Do you realize
that is 12 in a row?

50:14.912 --> 50:16.923
I'll tell you what, here.
Close your eyes a second.

50:16.947 --> 50:19.326
Go on, close them. I just
want to shuffle 'em up here,

50:19.350 --> 50:21.552
so they're a little different.

50:22.453 --> 50:24.055
All right.
Go ahead, open.

50:26.857 --> 50:29.026
Yeah, yeah, that's what I thought.
You give up?

50:29.594 --> 50:30.795
You don't have a queen.

50:32.297 --> 50:33.607
How do you do that?

50:33.631 --> 50:34.865
I saw it in the mirror.

50:42.740 --> 50:44.418
Yeah.

50:44.442 --> 50:47.921
Let me just teach you one
more game here, all right?

50:47.945 --> 50:50.781
Here. All right. Here we go, five cards.
Go ahead, pick 'em up.

50:55.286 --> 50:56.954
No beastie.

51:04.995 --> 51:06.731
No beasties!

51:08.666 --> 51:10.711
That's a fact!

51:10.735 --> 51:13.738
Dr. Dipstick says so!

51:25.450 --> 51:27.252
That's a fact.

51:40.097 --> 51:42.967
All right, I'll raise you four.

51:47.705 --> 51:50.083
You're bluffing again,
Mr. Dempsey.

51:51.276 --> 51:55.088
That is amazing, absolutely amazing.
Good for you.

51:55.112 --> 51:58.192
Look, Mommy. Mr. Dempsey
taught me how to play poker.

51:58.216 --> 52:01.162
Mr. Dempsey says he'll take
me to Disneyland someday.

52:01.186 --> 52:02.696
Yeah, well, forget Disneyland,

52:02.720 --> 52:04.121
we're going to Vegas, kiddo.

52:06.123 --> 52:07.268
Bed, please, Izzie. Now.

52:07.292 --> 52:09.560
May I kiss
Mr. Dempsey good night?

52:12.062 --> 52:14.141
You can.

52:14.165 --> 52:17.311
Good night. Good night, Mr. Dempsey.
Thank you for playing with me.

52:17.335 --> 52:19.003
Thanks for taking my money.

52:23.841 --> 52:25.619
You taught her poker.

52:25.643 --> 52:28.455
Yes. Yeah.
I, uh... I did.

52:28.479 --> 52:30.224
I'm sorry if I did wrong there,

52:30.248 --> 52:32.159
but do you have any idea

52:32.183 --> 52:36.197
the odds against somebody winning
that many times in a row?

52:36.221 --> 52:38.155
She inherited it
from her grandmother.

52:39.990 --> 52:41.635
Grandma was a card shark?

52:41.659 --> 52:45.172
No, it's the ability
to see things sometimes.

52:45.196 --> 52:47.365
They call it St. Columba's
gift around here.

52:48.699 --> 52:51.878
Yeah. Well, whatever it
is, I could use some.

52:51.902 --> 52:53.180
Her grandmother,

52:53.204 --> 52:56.817
she could read tea leaves

52:56.841 --> 53:00.221
and she could tell you whether your
baby would be a boy or a girl.

53:00.245 --> 53:03.089
I didn't inherit it,
but little Izzie did.

53:03.113 --> 53:05.892
The only thing I got from my
grandmother was bad eyes.

53:05.916 --> 53:08.052
Oh, no, I think you have nice...

53:12.189 --> 53:13.867
Uh, what...

53:13.891 --> 53:15.893
What I meant was that
I'm... I'm far-sighted.

53:16.927 --> 53:18.205
Uh...

53:18.229 --> 53:20.507
Uh, this bag is for you.

53:20.531 --> 53:23.377
It has the rest of Dr.
Abernathy's things in it.

53:23.401 --> 53:25.446
Adrian thought
that you could, um...

53:25.470 --> 53:26.513
Right, right.

53:26.537 --> 53:28.114
...take it back with you.
Right.

53:28.138 --> 53:31.017
Right. Good night, Mr. Dempsey.
See you tomorrow.

53:31.041 --> 53:32.209
John.

53:40.885 --> 53:42.696
Oh.

53:42.720 --> 53:45.799
All right, I'll see you
in the morning. Sleep well.

53:45.823 --> 53:49.202
Will you be hurt very much if Mr.
Dempsey goes home tomorrow, Mommy?

53:50.728 --> 53:52.439
Of course not.
What a question.

53:52.463 --> 53:54.064
Perhaps he won't go.

53:55.300 --> 53:56.501
Why do you say that?

53:59.236 --> 54:02.082
Because I don't want
him to and nor do you.

54:02.106 --> 54:04.651
Isabel, whatever
makes you think that?

54:04.675 --> 54:08.322
You look at him.
I've never seen you do that.

54:08.346 --> 54:09.890
Well, of course I look at him.

54:09.914 --> 54:12.259
What else am I supposed to do?

54:12.283 --> 54:13.894
It's nice to be
pleasant to guests,

54:13.918 --> 54:15.729
but you can't make
them your friends.

54:15.753 --> 54:17.254
I've told you that before.

54:17.755 --> 54:19.132
Yes, Mommy.

54:19.156 --> 54:20.834
Now go to sleep, please.

54:20.858 --> 54:22.235
Yes, Mommy.

54:22.259 --> 54:24.971
Stop "yes-mommying" me like that.
He's a guest, that's all.

54:26.263 --> 54:28.975
And don't give me that
I-know-what-you're-thinking look either.

54:28.999 --> 54:30.601
He'll stay if you ask him.

54:31.536 --> 54:32.746
Good night.

54:32.770 --> 54:33.914
Sleep tight.

54:33.938 --> 54:35.316
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

54:35.340 --> 54:39.143
If they do, use dynamite.
Mr. Dempsey taught me that.

54:46.551 --> 54:48.094
Problem?

54:48.118 --> 54:50.764
Yeah, uh, yeah, I... I don't
seem to have the knack.

54:50.788 --> 54:53.600
Uh, it has a slight
highlands temperament.

54:53.624 --> 54:55.693
It needs a little
encouragement here.

55:02.900 --> 55:04.010
Need any help?

55:04.034 --> 55:07.280
No, the air just needs to
be taken out of the pipes.

55:07.304 --> 55:10.508
Oh, can you watch the taps and
tell me when the water arrives?

55:12.242 --> 55:14.379
Yeah. Yeah, I can do that.

55:15.413 --> 55:16.647
I'm a PhD.

55:18.683 --> 55:20.160
Ah!

55:20.184 --> 55:21.628
Yeah, I hear something.

55:21.652 --> 55:23.921
Aye, it's running.
Touch wood.

55:26.190 --> 55:27.492
"Touch wood"?

55:28.158 --> 55:29.827
Back home, we knock on it.

55:34.231 --> 55:36.510
Uh, hmm...

55:36.534 --> 55:39.179
You'll be leaving us
in the morning.

55:39.203 --> 55:41.372
Uh, will you be
requiring breakfast?

55:42.507 --> 55:43.674
No. Thanks.

55:46.611 --> 55:49.856
Well, uh, you know,
it's included in the price.

55:49.880 --> 55:50.948
I realize that.

55:53.017 --> 55:54.785
Well, if you want to, you can
always change your mind.

55:56.687 --> 55:57.855
About what?

55:58.255 --> 55:59.600
Breakfast.

55:59.624 --> 56:00.791
Right.

57:34.451 --> 57:36.286
We're goin' out again.
Let's go.

57:37.822 --> 57:39.890
You can bring your pillow,
but let's go. Come on.

57:50.467 --> 57:54.404
Tell me something, Adrian, where were you
the night Abernathy got himself killed?

57:55.506 --> 57:57.383
I was at the MOFFAT Arms.

57:57.407 --> 57:58.676
But he left alone, right?

57:59.309 --> 58:00.554
Aye.

58:00.578 --> 58:02.288
He'd had a few malts,
said he needed some air.

58:02.312 --> 58:04.157
I offered to drive him home,
but he wouldn't let me.

58:04.181 --> 58:06.292
Yeah, but then
he wouldn't have seen it.

58:06.316 --> 58:07.317
Seen what?

58:09.319 --> 58:11.922
That is the last
photo on his roll.

58:13.824 --> 58:17.403
And that is not the tail
of a diving otter.

58:17.427 --> 58:19.806
It's not a vegetable mat.
It's not even a soliton.

58:19.830 --> 58:22.242
I don't know what it is,
but I'll tell you something.

58:22.266 --> 58:25.169
My guess is it's part
of something very large

58:26.571 --> 58:28.238
and very much alive.

58:46.957 --> 58:49.402
Why do people keep doing this?

58:49.426 --> 58:51.796
Oh, some people
don't respect the loch.

58:52.362 --> 58:54.098
They upset the waters.

58:58.368 --> 59:01.038
Somehow it got by us.

59:01.706 --> 59:03.684
Maybe it's hiding.

59:06.376 --> 59:08.021
Hmm.

59:08.045 --> 59:09.189
What are they?

59:15.052 --> 59:16.253
Salmon.

59:19.056 --> 59:20.390
Look at them all.

59:21.892 --> 59:24.061
You notice anything
unusual about them?

59:25.395 --> 59:26.563
Like what?

59:27.965 --> 59:30.067
Like they weren't
there yesterday.

59:33.403 --> 59:35.882
Like where the hell
did they come from?

59:42.647 --> 59:44.081
Is that more salmon?

59:45.249 --> 59:47.127
No, see, that's
a separate object...

59:47.151 --> 59:49.253
Mmm-hmm.
...chasing the salmon.

59:51.488 --> 59:53.133
Three feet.

59:53.157 --> 59:54.825
Eel. Could be
a conger eel.

59:55.425 --> 59:56.761
Yeah.
Mmm.

59:57.427 --> 59:58.929
No, it's still coming.

01:00:01.365 --> 01:00:03.243
No, that's a big vertebrate.

01:00:03.267 --> 01:00:06.246
A sturgeon, yeah?
A sturgeon maybe.

01:00:06.270 --> 01:00:07.504
It's still coming.

01:00:08.538 --> 01:00:10.340
Oh, my God, that's nine...

01:00:10.975 --> 01:00:12.452
That's 17.

01:00:12.476 --> 01:00:13.754
That's 40 feet long!

01:00:13.778 --> 01:00:15.922
It could be a submerged
vegetable mat.

01:00:15.946 --> 01:00:18.324
Yeah, maybe. No, no, no!

01:00:18.348 --> 01:00:20.150
Fire up the strobes.

01:00:21.451 --> 01:00:24.264
It's moving this way and it's
coming towards the surface.

01:00:24.288 --> 01:00:25.766
Where are the damn cameras?

01:00:25.790 --> 01:00:27.467
All recording.

01:00:27.491 --> 01:00:28.702
Hold it steady.

01:00:28.726 --> 01:00:30.103
I can't, it's moving too fast.

01:00:30.127 --> 01:00:31.604
Hold it steady. It's moving too fast!
It's moving too fast!

01:00:31.628 --> 01:00:32.939
I've lost him!
I've lost him!

01:00:32.963 --> 01:00:34.140
Fifteen knots.

01:00:34.164 --> 01:00:35.966
That's 15 knots. That's
coming straight at us!

01:00:37.234 --> 01:00:38.235
Get back!

01:00:44.842 --> 01:00:46.510
Adrian! Help!

01:00:48.645 --> 01:00:50.047
Dr. Dempsey!

01:01:25.916 --> 01:01:27.117
Dr. Dempsey!

01:01:29.086 --> 01:01:30.287
John!

01:01:52.910 --> 01:01:54.087
Is he dead?

01:01:54.111 --> 01:01:55.279
Maybe.

01:02:06.824 --> 01:02:10.070
Alive! Alive!
Look, he's alive!

01:02:10.094 --> 01:02:11.704
I saw it.
It's down there.

01:02:11.728 --> 01:02:14.540
Oh, I saw it, I swear to you.
Good!

01:02:16.066 --> 01:02:18.635
I swear to God I saw it.
I swear to you, I saw it!

01:02:21.271 --> 01:02:23.383
I gotta get out there again.

01:02:23.407 --> 01:02:25.618
You're going nowhere
until you see a doctor.

01:02:25.642 --> 01:02:28.989
Oh, my God, it's true, isn't it?

01:02:29.013 --> 01:02:30.456
You said you'd seen it.
You did! You did!

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:32.058
No! I've never
seen anything.

01:02:32.082 --> 01:02:34.460
I was just giving you
a tourist story.

01:02:34.484 --> 01:02:36.662
Well, I have!
I've seen it!

01:02:37.754 --> 01:02:39.165
Oh, God, I feel like...

01:02:49.967 --> 01:02:51.577
John! Stop.

01:02:51.601 --> 01:02:52.745
No, I'm sorry, I...

01:02:52.769 --> 01:02:54.480
Ah, Izzie, did you want
a drink or something?

01:02:54.504 --> 01:02:58.684
Ah, Izzie, uh... Water, probably.
Here we go.

01:02:58.708 --> 01:03:02.122
Anyway, that's your, uh,
basic mouth-to-mouth method.

01:03:02.146 --> 01:03:04.290
It's a good thing that Adrian
was up on his lifesaving.

01:03:04.314 --> 01:03:06.459
Could, uh,
help me with this here?

01:03:06.483 --> 01:03:07.484
Oh.

01:03:08.618 --> 01:03:10.630
Did Adrian kiss you,
Mr. Dempsey?

01:03:15.159 --> 01:03:17.503
You stay right where you are.

01:03:17.527 --> 01:03:19.272
I'm gonna call a doctor.

01:03:19.296 --> 01:03:20.330
Mmm-mmm.

01:03:21.665 --> 01:03:23.133
You don't have to do that.

01:03:23.834 --> 01:03:25.278
Did you see the kelpie?

01:03:25.302 --> 01:03:29.006
Yes! Yes, I did.
I think I did. Yeah.

01:03:29.874 --> 01:03:31.184
Oh! What? What?

01:03:31.208 --> 01:03:32.953
Would you like to see it again?

01:03:32.977 --> 01:03:35.980
Yeah. Oh, yeah.
Yes, I do.

01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:38.348
Of course I would, yeah.

01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:46.199
Is the entire boat
wrecked, Bailiff?

01:03:46.223 --> 01:03:47.858
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

01:03:48.859 --> 01:03:50.094
Demolished.

01:03:50.827 --> 01:03:52.562
And all his gear.

01:03:53.497 --> 01:03:55.375
Well, I hope the bugger drowned.

01:03:55.399 --> 01:03:57.501
No, no, no, he's very much alive

01:03:58.835 --> 01:04:02.082
and you'll find him over
at Laura's pub, I'm sure.

01:04:02.106 --> 01:04:06.276
I'm not drinking at Ms.
McFrigid's place at present.

01:04:08.445 --> 01:04:11.257
She did not look
very frigid to me.

01:04:11.281 --> 01:04:15.161
No, he was sitting there
having his dinner and

01:04:15.185 --> 01:04:17.888
playing games with the wee lassie,
just like one of the family.

01:04:19.356 --> 01:04:20.666
His equipment may have gone,

01:04:20.690 --> 01:04:22.692
but there's something
keeping him here.

01:04:26.030 --> 01:04:27.197
Oh, well.

01:04:31.035 --> 01:04:32.937
It's bloody cold out here.

01:04:35.039 --> 01:04:36.974
Dr. Mercer called
about what happened.

01:04:38.075 --> 01:04:39.776
I'm sorry, but he's coming over.

01:04:42.379 --> 01:04:44.190
Look, to be quite
honest with you,

01:04:44.214 --> 01:04:46.559
I should tell you that I didn't
actually see something out there today.

01:04:46.583 --> 01:04:48.294
I mean, I didn't see a monster.

01:04:48.318 --> 01:04:49.595
I'd like to say that I
had seen something,

01:04:49.619 --> 01:04:52.432
but I couldn't honestly back
you up or anything. I mean...

01:04:54.824 --> 01:04:56.802
It is going to be a bit
difficult to do any more

01:04:56.826 --> 01:04:59.639
without any equipment,
isn't it? Huh?

01:04:59.663 --> 01:05:00.873
I mean, it's not
as if we can see...

01:05:00.897 --> 01:05:02.166
It's down there.

01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:05.635
It's out there.
I know it is.

01:05:11.241 --> 01:05:13.486
Go away, you charlatans!

01:05:13.510 --> 01:05:15.088
Crazy...

01:05:15.112 --> 01:05:18.582
Stay away from my monster!

01:05:19.916 --> 01:05:23.096
He's not your monster,
he's my monster!

01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:25.231
I saw him first.
Do you hear me?

01:05:27.491 --> 01:05:29.335
My monster!

01:06:00.824 --> 01:06:01.992
Hello?

01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:04.537
Yeah...

01:06:04.561 --> 01:06:07.107
Dr. Mercer,
did you say?

01:06:07.131 --> 01:06:09.699
Yes, yes, that's
right, John Dempsey.

01:06:11.135 --> 01:06:12.169
Yes.

01:06:15.972 --> 01:06:18.042
I'm sorry, but he
left here yesterday.

01:06:19.643 --> 01:06:21.811
I said we're closed
for the season.

01:06:22.646 --> 01:06:24.581
Have you tried the Isle of Skye?

01:07:12.429 --> 01:07:15.675
Get up, Yank!
Take what's comin' to you.

01:07:15.699 --> 01:07:19.179
Whoa, hold on a second, will you?
The boat's insured, all right?

01:07:19.203 --> 01:07:21.114
It's not the boat, you pillock.

01:07:21.138 --> 01:07:23.083
You just get out
of my woman's house!

01:07:23.107 --> 01:07:24.450
Your woman?
Oh, that's great.

01:07:24.474 --> 01:07:26.619
Your woman? What, do you think
she's sheep or something?

01:07:26.643 --> 01:07:28.788
Give me a break. Okay, are you
thinkin' of movin' in yourself?

01:07:28.812 --> 01:07:30.056
Andy, stop it!

01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:31.424
Stay out of this. It's
between him and me.

01:07:31.448 --> 01:07:33.459
Will you stop it?
You have no right!

01:07:33.483 --> 01:07:34.527
John, don't fight him.

01:07:34.551 --> 01:07:36.229
Me? I'm not
fighting anybody.

01:07:36.253 --> 01:07:38.464
Andy! Shut it, you
sleekit whore!

01:07:38.488 --> 01:07:40.633
Oh, come on. You can't
talk to a lady like that!

01:07:40.657 --> 01:07:43.269
I'll talk any way I want. Or are
you the man to stop me, huh?

01:07:43.293 --> 01:07:44.937
You know what?
I'll tell you...

01:07:44.961 --> 01:07:46.596
Give me your best
shot here, Bigfoot.

01:08:00.644 --> 01:08:02.788
Hit him again and I'll deck ya!

01:08:02.812 --> 01:08:04.248
You wouldn't dare.

01:08:12.922 --> 01:08:14.958
Thank you for
standing up to him.

01:08:16.593 --> 01:08:18.295
The lights went out
pretty quick.

01:08:19.095 --> 01:08:21.474
Did I touch him at all?

01:08:21.497 --> 01:08:24.934
Well, aye, you did.
You got a few in.

01:08:26.203 --> 01:08:27.537
Liar.

01:08:30.106 --> 01:08:32.118
Now, you stay
right where you are.

01:08:32.142 --> 01:08:34.377
I'm gonna put some
camphor on those cuts.

01:08:35.511 --> 01:08:36.856
You're gonna live, John.

01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:37.947
Mmm.

01:08:39.448 --> 01:08:40.517
Touch wood.

01:08:43.386 --> 01:08:46.198
Izzie?
What are you doing up?

01:08:46.223 --> 01:08:48.457
I made something
for Mr. Dempsey.

01:08:51.027 --> 01:08:52.438
Night-night.
Night-night.

01:08:52.462 --> 01:08:53.729
Dynamite.

01:09:02.805 --> 01:09:04.174
That is so sweet.

01:09:36.206 --> 01:09:37.841
"The American.

01:09:38.707 --> 01:09:42.379
"Very nice, very good-looking.

01:09:43.346 --> 01:09:45.113
"He bought some bonny socks."

01:09:57.761 --> 01:10:01.865
Laura McFetridge,
you're such a scandal.

01:10:41.905 --> 01:10:45.509
"Get well, Dockter Dimzee."

01:10:47.277 --> 01:10:48.654
Ah!

01:11:28.217 --> 01:11:29.762
Mr. Dempsey.

01:11:29.786 --> 01:11:31.764
Oh, hi.

01:11:31.788 --> 01:11:34.266
I'm sorry if I woke you,
I was just, uh...

01:11:34.290 --> 01:11:35.935
I was on the way
to the bathroom.

01:11:35.959 --> 01:11:37.026
Oh!

01:11:41.297 --> 01:11:43.175
Do you like my get-well card?

01:11:43.199 --> 01:11:44.610
Yeah! Yes, yes.

01:11:44.634 --> 01:11:46.846
It's... It's fantastic.

01:11:46.870 --> 01:11:49.014
It's the perfect Elasmosaur,

01:11:49.038 --> 01:11:52.117
right down to the
rhomboid frontals. See?

01:11:52.141 --> 01:11:55.345
No, Mr. Dempsey.
It's a water kelpie.

01:11:57.481 --> 01:11:58.824
So this is your kelpie?

01:11:58.848 --> 01:12:00.249
It's my friend.

01:12:02.486 --> 01:12:04.654
Are you telling me
you actually saw...

01:12:05.188 --> 01:12:06.322
Aye.

01:12:06.723 --> 01:12:07.833
"Aye."

01:12:09.493 --> 01:12:12.237
You're laughing at me. You
don't believe me. No one does.

01:12:12.261 --> 01:12:13.739
I shouldn't have drawn it.

01:12:13.763 --> 01:12:17.643
No, no, no, I'm not laughing at you.
It's just that...

01:12:20.504 --> 01:12:22.682
I have to see it
before I can believe it.

01:12:22.706 --> 01:12:24.484
No, Mr. Dempsey.

01:12:24.508 --> 01:12:27.276
You've got to believe it
before you can see it.

01:12:32.115 --> 01:12:33.349
I believe you.

01:12:35.385 --> 01:12:36.829
And I want to see it.

01:12:36.853 --> 01:12:38.864
Do you?
Oh, yeah.

01:12:38.888 --> 01:12:40.400
More than anything in the world.

01:12:40.424 --> 01:12:43.068
Do you know what I want more
than anything else in the world?

01:12:43.092 --> 01:12:44.127
Yeah, what?

01:12:44.761 --> 01:12:46.362
A red bicycle.

01:12:52.201 --> 01:12:53.846
It's a deal.

01:12:53.870 --> 01:12:55.038
It's a deal.

01:12:56.873 --> 01:13:00.085
It's a secret.
You can't tell.

01:13:00.109 --> 01:13:02.779
We can't bring Bruce
'cause he barks.

01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:05.615
Wait, wait!
Wait for me!

01:13:06.616 --> 01:13:08.552
Come on, Mr. Dempsey!

01:13:12.789 --> 01:13:15.968
Please be quick,
Mr. Dempsey.

01:13:15.992 --> 01:13:18.562
Slow down! Slow down!
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

01:13:35.278 --> 01:13:36.345
Isabel?

01:13:37.413 --> 01:13:38.448
Oh, boy.

01:13:40.116 --> 01:13:43.086
Okay, the joke's over.

01:13:44.621 --> 01:13:46.523
Where are you, Isabel?

01:13:47.423 --> 01:13:48.925
Holy moley!

01:13:49.593 --> 01:13:50.960
Oh!
I'm here.

01:13:51.661 --> 01:13:53.238
Oh, that's great.

01:13:53.262 --> 01:13:55.741
I'm a grownup, how am I
supposed to fit through that?

01:13:55.765 --> 01:13:57.242
You can hold your tummy in.

01:13:57.266 --> 01:13:59.278
I can hold my tummy in.

01:13:59.302 --> 01:14:01.747
Thank you very much.

01:14:01.771 --> 01:14:04.440
This whole country
is made for midgets.

01:14:05.542 --> 01:14:08.087
Wet frozen midgets!

01:14:08.111 --> 01:14:11.657
Ah, jeez, that's great.
Now I'm stuck.

01:14:11.681 --> 01:14:13.793
Please be quick,
Mr. Dempsey.

01:14:13.817 --> 01:14:16.261
"Please be quick,
Mr. Dempsey."

01:14:21.190 --> 01:14:22.968
Oh, this is crazy.

01:14:24.694 --> 01:14:26.029
Where'd you go?

01:14:31.868 --> 01:14:32.902
Oh.

01:14:38.642 --> 01:14:39.809
Oh.

01:14:41.477 --> 01:14:44.681
Oh, my God,
this place is amazing!

01:14:46.249 --> 01:14:49.018
Turn the light off.
It scares them.

01:14:52.522 --> 01:14:54.157
Be very still.

01:15:03.366 --> 01:15:05.044
Where are we?

01:15:05.068 --> 01:15:06.679
Shh! Listen.

01:15:22.018 --> 01:15:23.186
Oh!

01:15:28.692 --> 01:15:30.059
Sea otters.

01:15:33.196 --> 01:15:34.698
Oh, my God.

01:15:37.567 --> 01:15:41.705
Sea otters, water kelpies,
aquatic mustelids.

01:15:46.275 --> 01:15:48.211
Come on, Izzie.
Let's go.

01:15:52.882 --> 01:15:54.217
I've had enough.

01:16:16.472 --> 01:16:17.506
Iz... Iz...

01:16:25.281 --> 01:16:26.482
Isabel.

01:16:27.651 --> 01:16:29.018
Don't move.

01:16:30.687 --> 01:16:31.821
It's okay.

01:16:33.657 --> 01:16:36.001
It's all right.
I've got you.

01:16:36.025 --> 01:16:37.761
He's just playing.

01:17:03.953 --> 01:17:05.121
Oh, boy.

01:17:52.836 --> 01:17:53.846
No!

01:17:53.870 --> 01:17:54.938
No!

01:17:56.172 --> 01:17:57.273
No!

01:17:59.943 --> 01:18:01.110
No!

01:18:09.452 --> 01:18:11.454
Izzie? Izzie!

01:18:22.131 --> 01:18:23.299
Izzie!

01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:46.622
Oh, my God! Izzie!

01:19:04.740 --> 01:19:05.885
Are you okay?

01:19:05.909 --> 01:19:07.844
I told you about the light!

01:19:08.912 --> 01:19:10.279
I'm sorry, I...

01:19:11.981 --> 01:19:13.516
Damn you to hell.

01:19:15.084 --> 01:19:16.519
You had no right.

01:19:26.863 --> 01:19:30.099
Oh, no.
Come on, come on.

01:19:31.100 --> 01:19:34.037
Oh, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no.

01:19:36.439 --> 01:19:37.841
This can't be.

01:19:38.607 --> 01:19:40.920
Come on, please, please...

01:19:40.944 --> 01:19:42.922
Oh, yes!
Yes! Yes!

01:19:42.946 --> 01:19:45.424
Oh, God, yes!

01:19:45.448 --> 01:19:47.359
Oh, oh, oh!

01:19:47.383 --> 01:19:49.528
The head! God, yes!

01:19:49.552 --> 01:19:50.629
You bastard!

01:19:50.653 --> 01:19:52.131
You could have killed her!

01:19:52.155 --> 01:19:53.532
What are you...

01:19:53.556 --> 01:19:56.001
You're just for yourself.
That's all that matters.

01:19:56.025 --> 01:19:58.370
Use people, as long as
you get what you want.

01:19:58.394 --> 01:20:00.539
Using me... I mean, I
should have known better,

01:20:00.563 --> 01:20:02.307
but to use a child!

01:20:02.331 --> 01:20:03.608
No, it wasn't like that.

01:20:03.632 --> 01:20:06.311
Oh, yes? And what was it like?
She nearly drowned!

01:20:06.335 --> 01:20:08.547
Oh, Laura...
Don't you touch me.

01:20:08.571 --> 01:20:11.483
Don't you dare touch me. All
right, all right, all right.

01:20:11.507 --> 01:20:12.952
Look!

01:20:12.976 --> 01:20:14.553
Look what I have.
Come on, look at it!

01:20:14.577 --> 01:20:17.122
Yeah, you got
your precious monster.

01:20:17.146 --> 01:20:19.024
You've got your
Scottish souvenir.

01:20:19.048 --> 01:20:20.792
I hope you got
your money's worth.

01:20:20.816 --> 01:20:22.218
A man's here.

01:20:22.986 --> 01:20:24.053
Yeah.

01:20:28.091 --> 01:20:31.060
No. No, no, God.

01:20:41.204 --> 01:20:43.548
It's a convergent sub-species.

01:20:43.572 --> 01:20:46.485
It's a hybrid of
Plesiosaur and Elasmosaur.

01:20:47.877 --> 01:20:49.212
You actually saw this?

01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:54.050
Now wait a minute, John.

01:20:54.750 --> 01:20:56.428
Hold on a minute.

01:20:56.452 --> 01:21:00.056
Now you're saying that this is the real...
Real thing. You saw it?

01:21:02.191 --> 01:21:04.203
No, I don't believe it.

01:21:04.227 --> 01:21:06.705
I can't believe it.
It's not possible.

01:21:06.729 --> 01:21:08.373
I don't believe it.

01:21:08.397 --> 01:21:10.042
You saw it, didn't you?

01:21:10.066 --> 01:21:11.610
You did.
Yeah, all right.

01:21:11.634 --> 01:21:13.412
I believe it.
I believe it!

01:21:14.637 --> 01:21:16.515
I knew it had to be there.

01:21:16.539 --> 01:21:19.042
I knew there was something.

01:21:21.277 --> 01:21:22.378
You told anyone?

01:21:22.611 --> 01:21:23.688
No.

01:21:23.712 --> 01:21:24.948
You sure?

01:21:25.381 --> 01:21:26.458
Yeah.

01:21:26.482 --> 01:21:28.894
Let's keep it quiet until
after the press conference.

01:21:28.918 --> 01:21:33.198
I'll call London today.
We'll have a symposium

01:21:33.222 --> 01:21:35.200
at the Royal Academy tomorrow.
You have a suit?

01:21:35.224 --> 01:21:36.235
Yeah.

01:21:36.259 --> 01:21:38.227
You? You have a suit?
No!

01:21:38.761 --> 01:21:39.871
Hello?

01:21:39.895 --> 01:21:41.397
What is this?

01:21:42.231 --> 01:21:43.332
Money?

01:21:43.899 --> 01:21:45.377
Hello?

01:21:48.404 --> 01:21:50.049
Mr. Dempsey.
Yep.

01:21:50.073 --> 01:21:51.116
Your bill is in your room.

01:21:51.140 --> 01:21:53.218
Uh, I believe it's as we agreed.

01:21:53.242 --> 01:21:54.819
There'll be no extra
charge for the sex.

01:21:54.843 --> 01:21:56.721
That's a service
I offer all my guests.

01:21:56.745 --> 01:21:58.924
Wait a minute, wait a
minute, let me explain.

01:21:58.948 --> 01:22:00.492
About what?
This is crazy.

01:22:00.516 --> 01:22:01.726
You've solved
your mystery, John,

01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:03.228
you found your missing link.
You can leave now.

01:22:03.252 --> 01:22:06.398
No, no! I found a colony
of prehistoric animals!

01:22:06.422 --> 01:22:09.301
Look at this, they're alive!
I'm very happy for you.

01:22:09.325 --> 01:22:11.070
Hey, it's not just for me.

01:22:11.094 --> 01:22:14.006
This is gonna be good for all of us.
Don't you realize that?

01:22:14.030 --> 01:22:17.142
Come on, Laura, you're gonna have
scientists, marine biologists,

01:22:17.166 --> 01:22:20.579
every lab and university in the
world is gonna want to stay here.

01:22:20.603 --> 01:22:22.581
You mean when they turn
the loch into Marineland,

01:22:22.605 --> 01:22:25.017
with the kelpie performing
tricks for a few sardines?

01:22:25.041 --> 01:22:26.918
It's not gonna be like that.
This is science.

01:22:26.942 --> 01:22:28.453
But how do you stop it?

01:22:28.477 --> 01:22:31.756
Will you be there along with the
other 10 million nature lovers

01:22:31.780 --> 01:22:33.116
queuing for a McNessie burger?

01:22:34.517 --> 01:22:37.762
What do you want me to do?
You want me to ignore this?

01:22:37.786 --> 01:22:40.199
You want me to pretend
that I didn't see this?

01:22:40.223 --> 01:22:41.433
That's up to you.

01:22:41.457 --> 01:22:44.936
Oh, come... Look, look at this.
Can you see that?

01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:46.771
I've waited my entire
life for this.

01:22:46.795 --> 01:22:47.839
Good.

01:22:47.863 --> 01:22:49.808
Oh, come on! You're not
even lookin' at it!

01:22:49.832 --> 01:22:52.211
I don't want to look at them!
Don't you get it?

01:22:52.235 --> 01:22:55.280
I don't want to know
anything about them!

01:22:55.304 --> 01:22:57.540
There are some things that are

01:22:59.175 --> 01:23:01.953
meant to be left alone.

01:23:01.977 --> 01:23:04.813
I would have thought that you
would have understood that.

01:23:06.982 --> 01:23:09.818
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
wait a minute. Wait a minute.

01:23:13.256 --> 01:23:14.323
Where's Isabel?

01:23:15.991 --> 01:23:17.593
She doesn't want to see you.

01:23:18.661 --> 01:23:20.329
She trusted you, John.

01:23:31.006 --> 01:23:33.585
Here.
Have three drams, laddie,

01:23:33.609 --> 01:23:37.056
and you might catch a wee
glimpse of the beastie today.

01:24:02.538 --> 01:24:04.783
Hi, Izzie.

01:24:04.807 --> 01:24:09.521
Why did you do it? You scared it away.
They'll never come back.

01:24:09.545 --> 01:24:12.215
Look... Uh,
yes, they will.

01:24:13.249 --> 01:24:16.295
I'm sorry, don't be upset.
It's not your fault.

01:24:16.319 --> 01:24:18.530
It is my fault.
I did wrong.

01:24:18.554 --> 01:24:20.265
No, you didn't.

01:24:20.289 --> 01:24:23.235
No, see, I don't think
it's something

01:24:23.259 --> 01:24:25.204
that you and I can
just keep to ourselves.

01:24:25.228 --> 01:24:27.206
I think it's something we
have to share with everybody.

01:24:27.230 --> 01:24:30.542
Why do we? I only
wanted to show you.

01:24:30.566 --> 01:24:32.067
I thought you liked me.

01:24:34.603 --> 01:24:36.105
I do like you.

01:24:40.109 --> 01:24:41.610
And you're going.

01:24:46.582 --> 01:24:48.684
I would do anything
not to hurt you.

01:24:50.586 --> 01:24:51.963
You've gotta believe me, Izzie.

01:24:51.987 --> 01:24:54.089
It's just that I...
I don't know what...

01:24:56.825 --> 01:24:57.993
See, there's...

01:24:59.262 --> 01:25:01.164
There's nothing
I can do right now.

01:25:06.435 --> 01:25:07.636
I know.

01:25:20.115 --> 01:25:21.284
Hey.

01:25:21.950 --> 01:25:23.195
By tomorrow morning,

01:25:23.219 --> 01:25:27.190
you just may be the most
famous man in the whole world.

01:25:28.524 --> 01:25:30.435
Huh?

01:25:30.459 --> 01:25:32.837
I need a drink.
You want anything?

01:25:32.861 --> 01:25:36.141
I don't drink. I'm gonna take
up wind surfing, though.

01:25:36.165 --> 01:25:37.842
The Royal Academy's too small.

01:25:37.866 --> 01:25:40.345
I got the Natural
History Museum instead.

01:25:40.369 --> 01:25:43.382
No! No, no, no, no. I'm not
blowing off Larry King.

01:25:43.406 --> 01:25:45.717
I'm saying it's fine if we could do
it by satellite,

01:25:45.741 --> 01:25:47.719
'cause I'll be here. Adam,
get the phone, the phone.

01:25:47.743 --> 01:25:49.645
Oh! Hello? Hello?
What?

01:25:57.720 --> 01:26:00.299
Have another.
It's a celebration.

01:26:00.323 --> 01:26:02.301
If you're gonna hang my
head from a horse's mane,

01:26:02.325 --> 01:26:04.703
I wish you'd get it over with.

01:26:04.727 --> 01:26:07.339
Oh, no, sir,
I wouldn't do that now.

01:26:07.363 --> 01:26:10.809
Oh, no, you've beaten the loch.

01:26:10.833 --> 01:26:12.668
There's no disputing that.

01:26:13.769 --> 01:26:15.914
Savor it is my advice.

01:26:15.938 --> 01:26:18.006
Uh, may I?

01:26:19.041 --> 01:26:20.909
Yes.

01:26:22.177 --> 01:26:23.855
Yes, uh, let's see.

01:26:23.879 --> 01:26:27.192
1953 was the first time
that I went to London.

01:26:27.216 --> 01:26:29.051
I didn't think too much of it.

01:26:31.554 --> 01:26:34.699
And I swore to myself that

01:26:34.723 --> 01:26:39.003
if ever I went back, it would have
to be for a very good reason.

01:26:39.027 --> 01:26:42.030
We both know why you're here,
so let's not play games.

01:26:45.033 --> 01:26:46.845
We cannot let

01:26:46.869 --> 01:26:51.350
the survival of the last
specimens of the Ice Age

01:26:51.374 --> 01:26:53.685
depend solely on
the work of one man.

01:26:53.709 --> 01:26:55.787
It doesn't make any sense.

01:26:55.811 --> 01:26:59.023
Science can take care
of them professionally.

01:26:59.047 --> 01:27:01.460
The sad thing is that you
really believe that, don't you?

01:27:01.484 --> 01:27:03.695
Yes. Yes, I do.

01:27:03.719 --> 01:27:07.723
It wasn't exactly science that
helped your discovery, was it?

01:27:08.257 --> 01:27:09.825
It was a wee girl.

01:27:10.626 --> 01:27:11.960
Nine years of age.

01:27:13.662 --> 01:27:16.207
And wasn't it
your precious science

01:27:16.231 --> 01:27:20.479
that gave us all this
acid rain and pollution

01:27:20.503 --> 01:27:22.414
and warming air
in the first place?

01:27:22.438 --> 01:27:23.572
Hmm?

01:27:28.411 --> 01:27:32.223
These creatures have
survived for 15,000 years

01:27:32.247 --> 01:27:33.925
without your help,
Mr. Dempsey.

01:27:33.949 --> 01:27:36.685
What makes you think that
you're so special, huh?

01:27:42.958 --> 01:27:44.126
I...

01:27:50.433 --> 01:27:52.010
This is very hard for me.

01:27:55.137 --> 01:27:57.749
I'm a proud man,

01:27:57.773 --> 01:28:02.277
and I have never asked anybody
for anything in my life

01:28:05.213 --> 01:28:06.949
as I'm asking you now.

01:28:08.951 --> 01:28:10.653
Don't do this,
Mr. Dempsey.

01:28:23.366 --> 01:28:24.533
Oh, well.

01:28:32.140 --> 01:28:34.377
Well, I have a loch to tend to.

01:28:40.649 --> 01:28:43.218
Thank you.
Safe journey to you.

01:29:04.707 --> 01:29:07.919
Is the mystery
of Loch Ness finally solved?

01:29:07.943 --> 01:29:09.721
The world's media
is gathering tonight

01:29:09.745 --> 01:29:11.723
at the Natural History Museum
in London,

01:29:11.747 --> 01:29:13.157
where a new American
underwater survey

01:29:13.181 --> 01:29:15.660
will claim to have
discovered definitive evidence

01:29:15.684 --> 01:29:17.920
of the existence
of the Loch Ness monster.

01:29:57.660 --> 01:29:59.628
John?
John, John.

01:30:02.665 --> 01:30:03.942
Let's go.

01:30:03.966 --> 01:30:05.043
Lead on, McDuff.

01:30:05.067 --> 01:30:06.301
Certainly.

01:30:09.572 --> 01:30:12.216
I've seen two miracles tonight.

01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:14.753
One is a man
rising from the dead.

01:30:14.777 --> 01:30:16.721
It's good to
be alive again, Bob.

01:30:16.745 --> 01:30:18.146
Nice suit, John.

01:30:28.991 --> 01:30:30.993
Thank you,
Dr. Binns.

01:30:32.094 --> 01:30:33.929
Ladies and gentlemen,
good evening.

01:30:35.330 --> 01:30:39.310
When I, uh... When I began
my expedition to the loch,

01:30:39.334 --> 01:30:42.246
it was based only on a hunch.

01:30:42.270 --> 01:30:45.416
But as we all know, so many
discoveries have been made

01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:47.810
by using a little
imagination and, uh,

01:30:49.144 --> 01:30:51.189
bending the rules,

01:30:51.213 --> 01:30:54.149
like, uh, Newton, Galileo.

01:30:56.018 --> 01:31:00.198
And with this in mind, I asked my
colleague, Dr. Jonathan Dempsey,

01:31:00.222 --> 01:31:05.269
to concentrate his efforts on the
scientific enigma of Loch Ness.

01:31:05.293 --> 01:31:07.672
I'll ask him now to present
you with his findings.

01:31:07.696 --> 01:31:08.864
Dr. Dempsey.

01:31:27.215 --> 01:31:29.552
I used to dream about
this when I was a kid.

01:31:31.654 --> 01:31:33.589
But I have to admit,
this is, uh,

01:31:35.323 --> 01:31:37.926
much more overwhelming
than I thought it would be.

01:31:43.065 --> 01:31:46.911
I'd like to say that
I wouldn't be here today

01:31:46.935 --> 01:31:49.981
if it weren't for the
confidence and the trust

01:31:50.005 --> 01:31:53.842
of the architect of this study, Dr.
Robert Mercer.

01:32:13.461 --> 01:32:15.263
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:32:16.064 --> 01:32:19.301
the mystery of Loch Ness solved.

01:32:20.603 --> 01:32:22.404
Nessosaurus Maurus.

01:32:35.117 --> 01:32:36.484
A bit murky.

01:32:38.721 --> 01:32:40.298
Did they balls up the slides?

01:32:40.322 --> 01:32:41.933
What's going on?

01:32:41.957 --> 01:32:43.391
Uh, I...

01:32:45.093 --> 01:32:47.471
It's getting better to me.

01:32:47.495 --> 01:32:50.041
You're right. You're absolutely right.
I'm sorry, I apologize.

01:32:50.065 --> 01:32:52.911
Ladies and gentlemen...
Sit down, Bob. Sit down.

01:32:52.935 --> 01:32:54.913
You know, I... I canceled
dinner for this.

01:32:54.937 --> 01:32:56.414
It's all right, just a mistake.

01:32:56.438 --> 01:32:58.016
I hope so.

01:32:58.040 --> 01:32:59.618
Ladies and gentlemen,
when you see this next picture,

01:32:59.642 --> 01:33:03.245
I hope you have the courage
to ask yourself the question,

01:33:04.112 --> 01:33:05.280
"Where's Waldo?"

01:33:06.248 --> 01:33:07.726
Waldo?

01:33:07.750 --> 01:33:08.951
What's Waldo?

01:33:21.296 --> 01:33:24.108
I'm sorry,
I don't know what to say.

01:33:24.132 --> 01:33:27.078
No, it's not a hoax. This is not a
hoax as far as we're concerned.

01:33:27.102 --> 01:33:28.780
This is purely the Americans...

01:33:28.804 --> 01:33:30.615
Who's what? MALE
REPORTER: Who is Waldo?

01:33:30.639 --> 01:33:32.775
"Who is Waldo?" I have
no idea who Waldo is.

01:33:42.550 --> 01:33:43.762
Listen to me.
Listen to me.

01:33:43.786 --> 01:33:45.930
The whole thing was
a ridiculous hoax.

01:33:45.954 --> 01:33:47.298
I never saw them.

01:33:47.322 --> 01:33:50.292
I... I had the pictures made up
by computer before I even came.

01:33:52.494 --> 01:33:53.838
Please.

01:33:57.900 --> 01:34:01.503
John Dempsey, you are either the
biggest bloody fool that ever lived,

01:34:02.671 --> 01:34:07.710
or you are the biggest
bloody fool that ever lived.

01:34:09.477 --> 01:34:10.645
Thank you.

01:34:12.180 --> 01:34:13.849
Thank you for everything.

01:34:16.719 --> 01:34:18.562
Where are you going?

01:34:18.586 --> 01:34:19.822
Home.

01:34:22.691 --> 01:34:24.026
Good luck.

01:34:25.660 --> 01:34:26.995
Professor!

01:34:28.030 --> 01:34:32.076
Adrian was with me, and we
stopped along the pier,

01:34:32.100 --> 01:34:33.912
he saw the pictures.

01:34:33.936 --> 01:34:37.539
Will you tell, uh, Dr.
Binns about the photos?

01:34:44.179 --> 01:34:46.949
What photos would
they be, exactly?

01:34:50.418 --> 01:34:51.787
Well?

01:34:57.059 --> 01:34:58.426
I'm waiting.

01:36:19.341 --> 01:36:22.653
"Arrietty had not been asleep.

01:36:22.677 --> 01:36:25.589
"She had been lying
under her knitted coverlet,

01:36:25.613 --> 01:36:28.092
"staring up at the ceiling.

01:36:28.116 --> 01:36:30.261
"It was an interesting ceiling.

01:36:30.285 --> 01:36:34.598
"Pod had built Arrietty's
bedroom out of two cigar boxes,

01:36:34.622 --> 01:36:38.660
"and on the ceiling, lovely
painted ladies dressed in..."

01:36:40.128 --> 01:36:41.272
What is it?

01:36:41.296 --> 01:36:43.131
There's a car
blocking the drive.

01:37:04.987 --> 01:37:07.522
Do you realize that
you're blocking the drive?

01:37:08.323 --> 01:37:09.557
I do now.

01:37:11.093 --> 01:37:13.704
Well, what do you
intend to do about it?

01:37:13.728 --> 01:37:15.339
What would you like me
to do about it?

01:37:15.363 --> 01:37:16.740
Oh!

01:37:16.764 --> 01:37:19.510
<i>♪ Oh, the rhythm of my heart</i>

01:37:19.534 --> 01:37:22.013
<i>♪ Is beating like a drum</i>

01:37:22.037 --> 01:37:25.740
