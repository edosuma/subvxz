Evergreen Forest!

What in blazes is that?

00:07.507 --> 00:09.042
This is Bert Raccoon,

working undercover
on the Cyril Sneer story.

00:12.178 --> 00:15.415
The Pig: You're the one
with the secret recipe!

00:15.415 --> 00:17.384
Nobody will ever wanna see

Evergreen forest.

Quiet, peaceful, serene.

00:27.961 --> 00:30.363
That is, until
Bert Raccoon wakes up.

00:30.363 --> 00:32.198
Bert Raccoon: Yahoooo!

00:33.967 --> 00:35.735
Yeeeehaaaa!

Yikes!

Yaaaah...

00:42.042 --> 00:43.576
Yeaaaah!

00:43.576 --> 00:46.679
Luckily, he has some
good friends to help him out.

00:53.987 --> 00:56.456
Life would be simple
in the forest except for...

00:58.091 --> 00:59.526
Cyril Sneer!

Ralph gave you a byline

01:38.832 --> 01:40.867

on the Flower Show.

01:40.867 --> 01:42.168
It's very good, Bert.

Well, when
you ask for the best,

01:43.603 --> 01:45.905
you get the best, naturally!

01:45.905 --> 01:49.843
And that was a good story,
yeah, for page 6,

01:49.843 --> 01:53.746
but I got a front page
story for you this time!

if you liked me for that one,

01:59.886 --> 02:02.755
you're going to love me
for this one!

02:02.755 --> 02:04.457
It's incredible!

Are you getting this down?

02:22.976 --> 02:24.777
Tornadoes?! Where?

02:24.777 --> 02:26.579

notice any wind?

02:37.423 --> 02:39.559
Cedric! Missing?!

02:39.559 --> 02:42.061
In a tornado?!
Oh no!!

02:42.061 --> 02:44.564
That's terrible, Bert!

02:44.564 --> 02:47.233
Oh, I know,
I know that's what I said.

02:48.034 --> 02:49.903
Stop the presses!!

02:54.774 --> 02:58.278
Bert's story sent Ralph and
Melissa into a state of shock.

02:58.278 --> 03:01.214
Ralph found himself unable
to think of anything,

03:01.214 --> 03:03.583
except Cedric's disappearance.

03:03.583 --> 03:05.418
Poor Cedric.

03:05.418 --> 03:08.755
Yeah, maybe we can use
these pictures with the story.

03:08.755 --> 03:10.857
I can't
believe he's gone.

03:10.857 --> 03:13.626
I keep thinking he'll
walk through that door.

03:13.626 --> 03:15.628
(upset) Bert!
Hey!

03:15.628 --> 03:17.764
My pictures, Melissa!

03:17.764 --> 03:21.201
There's someone
here to see you, Bert!

03:21.201 --> 03:23.703
Hi Bert! Ralph.

03:23.703 --> 03:25.038
Cedric!!

03:25.038 --> 03:27.807
Bert told me you wanted
the temperature reading,

03:27.807 --> 03:32.478
so I got it, in both
Centigrade and Fahrenheit.

03:32.478 --> 03:35.915
You're alive!
H-how did you survive?

03:35.915 --> 03:37.083
Me?!

03:37.083 --> 03:40.186
Bert said you were
swept up by a tornado!

03:40.186 --> 03:42.488
He-he even has pictures.

03:42.488 --> 03:46.993
Tornado?! Oh...
that's me at my cookout.

03:46.993 --> 03:50.597
I guess I put too
much wood on the fire.

03:50.597 --> 03:54.100
You mean...
you made all this up?!

03:54.100 --> 03:56.869
The tornado, the
hundreds homeless?!

03:56.869 --> 03:59.973
Well, you said
you wanted a weather story.

04:03.376 --> 04:05.845
We want
true stories, Bert!

04:05.845 --> 04:07.814
And you've got
to report the truth,

04:07.814 --> 04:11.317
or we can't let you write
for the Evergreen Standard!

04:11.317 --> 04:15.321
But I gave you the best
story I could think of, Ralph.

04:15.321 --> 04:18.591
You know me, I aim to please!

04:18.591 --> 04:22.428
Bert Raccoon, ace reporter!

04:22.428 --> 04:24.998
That could be
aced reporter!

04:24.998 --> 04:27.533
Now, go out and get
me a weather report.

04:27.533 --> 04:30.803
And don't you ever
scare us like that again!

04:33.806 --> 04:35.174
Come on, Broo!

04:35.174 --> 04:37.043
Meanwhile, in a
different part

04:37.043 --> 04:38.544
of the Evergreen Forest...

04:38.544 --> 04:42.715
Come on, Broo.
Come on, boy, you like it.

04:43.416 --> 04:45.818
Broo, where are you, boy?

04:45.818 --> 04:48.288
Okay kids,
the bath's ready.

04:48.288 --> 04:51.024
Come on, Broo!
Baths are fun!

04:51.024 --> 04:53.092
There's nothing to be scared of.

04:54.260 --> 04:55.528
Easy, boy.

05:00.667 --> 05:02.402
Maybe he wants his toys.

05:02.402 --> 05:04.504
Well, where's
his rubber duck?

05:04.504 --> 05:06.839
I saw him playing with it
at the old Beaver pond.

05:06.839 --> 05:09.008
Stop it, Broo!

05:09.008 --> 05:11.477
Schaeffer, go find it!
Woof!

05:13.012 --> 05:17.717
The Evergreen forest was
savaged by storms this morning.

05:17.717 --> 05:19.052
Freak lightning lashed...

05:19.052 --> 05:21.988
But Bert,
it's a beautiful day.

05:21.988 --> 05:26.025
Come on,
that's not news, Cedric!

05:26.025 --> 05:28.594
News has got to be exciting!

05:28.594 --> 05:31.197
Oh, I wish something
big would happen.

05:31.197 --> 05:34.901
I wish a space ship would
come down from Mars!

05:34.901 --> 05:38.871
Or some other Galaxy,
with big ray guns blazing.

05:38.871 --> 05:39.872
Aaaah!

05:42.041 --> 05:44.744
Uaaaah! They're attacking
the Evergreen Forest!

05:50.616 --> 05:52.785
Yahoooo!

05:52.785 --> 05:55.121
Ah!...Ehm!

05:56.422 --> 05:58.524
Now, that's news.

05:59.759 --> 06:01.027
The rubber duck.

06:02.562 --> 06:04.597
Have you seen the rubber duck?

06:04.597 --> 06:06.065
Schaeffer?!

06:06.065 --> 06:07.800
I thought,
it was with the moose.

06:07.800 --> 06:10.603
Um... What moose?

06:10.603 --> 06:13.139
The one that goes
squawk when you bite it.

06:13.139 --> 06:16.442
Oh, there's something
wrong with Schaeffer?

06:18.644 --> 06:21.347
Um, did you lose
something, Schaeffer?

06:21.347 --> 06:23.082
Be careful, Cedric,

06:23.082 --> 06:25.451
he's foaming at the mouth,

06:25.451 --> 06:27.053
and you know
what that means.

06:28.921 --> 06:30.523
Mad dog!!

06:32.125 --> 06:33.893
Schaeffer?!

06:33.893 --> 06:36.329
He loses everything.

06:36.329 --> 06:38.664
He lost his tugboat too,
and his...

06:38.664 --> 06:41.734
See? He's babbling
like a maniac!

06:43.636 --> 06:45.972
We can't handle
this ourselves.

06:45.972 --> 06:47.774
We have to get help.

06:49.142 --> 06:51.677
But Ralph, you
gotta believe me!

06:51.677 --> 06:54.447
Asceptic! You saw it, didn't
you, didn't you, Cedric?

06:55.548 --> 06:57.750
But Schaeffer is
the most stable, normal...

06:57.750 --> 06:59.018
Hi, guys!

06:59.018 --> 07:01.954
Back Schaeffer, back, back!

07:01.954 --> 07:03.856
Um, I want
to place a notice

07:03.856 --> 07:07.360
in the Lost and Found
about Broo's duck.

07:07.360 --> 07:09.996
We can't get him to take
a bath without that Ducky.

07:09.996 --> 07:13.599
Is this
your Mad Dog, Bert?

07:13.599 --> 07:17.003
But, but...
he was frothing at the mouth.

07:17.003 --> 07:20.206
There were bubbles
everywhere and,

07:20.206 --> 07:23.776
he said he was going
to bite a moose!

07:26.212 --> 07:28.314
Look Bert,
maybe you're not cut out

07:28.314 --> 07:30.216

07:30.216 --> 07:32.418

more chance, Ralph.

07:32.418 --> 07:35.354

story out there.

as it's a true story.

Ralph a story.

12:28.781 --> 12:30.916
I'm going to
cover it in concrete!

12:31.917 --> 12:34.320
That'll make it quiet!
The Pig: But, Sir...

12:34.320 --> 12:37.690
Do I have to mix the
cement myself? Hop to it!

12:37.690 --> 12:38.758
The Pig: Yes, Sir!

12:38.758 --> 12:41.260
I'll have the quiet
you can only get

12:41.260 --> 12:44.864
in an empty parking lot at dawn!

12:45.331 --> 12:47.833
Asphalt,
Ralph, concrete!

12:47.833 --> 12:51.137
The whole forest
will be paved over!

12:51.137 --> 12:53.973
Is this another
one of your stories, Bert?

12:53.973 --> 12:55.841
You gotta
believe me, Ralph,

12:55.841 --> 12:59.011
we'll have nothing
to do but park cars.

13:00.212 --> 13:04.283
You're a real kidder, Bert,
with a great imagination.

13:04.283 --> 13:07.019
Ralph, I'm serious.

13:07.019 --> 13:08.788
You can
cancel the notice.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.222
We found the rubber ducky.

13:10.222 --> 13:12.458
Thanks, 'Mad Dog.'

13:13.692 --> 13:16.529
You don't believe me,
do you Ralph?

13:16.529 --> 13:18.864
Look, Bert...
I can prove it!

13:18.864 --> 13:21.100
I'll bring back proof!

13:21.500 --> 13:23.002
Real proof!

13:24.336 --> 13:26.672
The Pig: I don't care
how many trucks it takes!

13:26.672 --> 13:28.507
100, 200...

13:28.507 --> 13:31.811
I want that cement here
tomorrow. Do you read me?

13:33.412 --> 13:36.382
You just can't get
good help these days.

13:36.382 --> 13:38.317
Where's that sleepy time chef?

13:38.317 --> 13:39.819
He should be here by now.

13:42.488 --> 13:44.590
Testing, testing.

13:44.590 --> 13:47.526
Ehm! This is Bert Raccoon,

13:47.526 --> 13:49.829
Ace reporter, working undercover

13:49.829 --> 13:52.731
on the Cyril Sneer story.
I approa...

13:52.731 --> 13:54.733
The Pig: We've been
waiting for you!

13:54.733 --> 13:55.901
You have?!

13:55.901 --> 13:58.404
The Pig: The agency said
you'd be here yesterday.

13:58.404 --> 13:59.405
They did?!

13:59.405 --> 14:01.540
The Pig: The sleepy
time chef is here.

14:01.540 --> 14:02.775
The who?!

14:02.775 --> 14:07.213
The Pig 2: So, you're the
one with the secret recipe.

14:07.213 --> 14:10.850
The Pig 3: Your famous recipe,
that guarantees sleep.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.852
He's going to make zoop.

14:12.852 --> 14:16.555
The Pig 1:
Aaaah, oui, zoop!

14:16.555 --> 14:17.790
The Pig 3: Voila!

14:18.691 --> 14:20.459
The Pig 2: This better work!

14:20.459 --> 14:22.628
The boss is depending on you!

14:28.901 --> 14:31.103
Ah, but of course,

He had to show Ralph and Melissa

16:04.797 --> 16:07.866
that he was on to a
very real story indeed.

A story with dire consequences.

Where are those
cement trucks??

16:21.880 --> 16:24.083
That noise from that
forest is deafening!!!

16:24.083 --> 16:25.985
The Pig: Don't worry, Sir.
The trucks will be here

16:25.985 --> 16:27.553
first thing in the morning.

16:27.553 --> 16:29.021
I want to sleep now!!!

16:29.021 --> 16:31.423
Morning is eight
sleepless hours away.

16:31.423 --> 16:33.525
The Pig 2: Calm down, Sir.
Calm down?!

16:33.525 --> 16:35.995
I get vicious
when I can't sleep!

16:35.995 --> 16:38.764
I'm not my usual lovable self.

16:40.666 --> 16:43.002
The Pig 2: We have a
surprise for you, Sir,

16:43.002 --> 16:45.437
someone, to help you nod off.

16:52.111 --> 16:54.413
What in blazes is that?

16:54.413 --> 16:57.249
She's Auntie Bertha,
the story lady

16:57.249 --> 17:00.019
from the Tree Top Tuck-in
service, Sir.

17:01.620 --> 17:04.390
The Pig 1: She's the one who's
going to put you to sleep!

17:04.390 --> 17:06.125
Guaranteed!

17:07.393 --> 17:11.063
(giggles) Well,
of course, my little dears.

17:13.732 --> 17:14.967
Hmmm..?

17:14.967 --> 17:17.269
Haven't I seen you
somewhere before?!

17:17.269 --> 17:20.072
You may have
seen me on TV.

17:20.873 --> 17:23.876
Every afternoon.
And at nighttime.

17:23.876 --> 17:28.414
Perhaps. Well,
story lady, do your stuff.

17:28.414 --> 17:30.215
First, we tuck you in.

17:30.949 --> 17:33.052
Now.. did you brush your teeth

17:33.052 --> 17:35.154
like a good little boy?

17:35.154 --> 17:37.756
Grrrrrr...
Hi-hi! Well!

17:37.756 --> 17:39.324
Moving right along,

17:39.324 --> 17:41.627
The Pig: Doesn't he
get a good night kiss?

17:41.627 --> 17:45.397
(laughs) Usually
we start with the story.

17:45.397 --> 17:47.066
The Pig 2:
What about a bed time hug?

17:47.066 --> 17:49.501
No!!
The Pig 2: No?

17:49.501 --> 17:51.336
Once upon a time,

17:51.336 --> 17:53.572
there were Three Little Pigs.

17:53.572 --> 17:56.341
Pigs?!
Who cares about pigs?

17:56.775 --> 17:59.845
The Pigs: No one, Sir.
I want a real story.

17:59.845 --> 18:01.580
Give me King Midas!

18:01.580 --> 18:03.515
I want to hear about
Midas and his

18:03.515 --> 18:06.118
wonderful golden touch.

18:06.118 --> 18:09.588
Once upon a
time there was a King

18:09.588 --> 18:11.990
who had a golden touch.

18:11.990 --> 18:13.525
Oh, I like that!

18:13.525 --> 18:15.327
My kind of man.

18:15.327 --> 18:19.064
Everything he touched,
he turned to gold.

18:20.499 --> 18:22.835
Good! Good!!

18:22.835 --> 18:24.603
His cities were gold.

18:24.603 --> 18:26.338
His streets were gold.

18:26.338 --> 18:29.675
Marvelous! Marvelous!!

18:29.675 --> 18:32.144
In fact,
his whole kingdom

18:32.144 --> 18:34.947
was paved with gold.

18:36.048 --> 18:40.385
He even paved
the forest with gold.

18:40.385 --> 18:41.854
What do you think of that?

18:41.854 --> 18:44.189
The Pig: Ohh, that's nothing!!

18:44.189 --> 18:46.558
We're going
to do that tomorrow,

18:46.558 --> 18:49.328
with cement!
What?!

18:49.328 --> 18:51.797
Sh-sh! Calm down now.

18:51.797 --> 18:54.800
You won't get to sleep
that way, Mr Sneer,

18:54.800 --> 18:59.505
what you need is a
nice, relaxing massage.

18:59.505 --> 19:02.741
Those
silly little pigs.

19:02.741 --> 19:06.145
Why would anyone want
to pave the forest?

19:06.145 --> 19:07.146
Feels good!

19:07.513 --> 19:10.349
Hey...

19:10.349 --> 19:12.084
What's that Mr. Sneer?

19:12.084 --> 19:14.219
Mr. Sneer...

19:14.219 --> 19:16.989
Speak up!!!! Mr Sneer!

19:16.989 --> 19:19.858
The Pig 3: That's a strange
massage technique.

19:19.858 --> 19:23.896
The Pig 2: Well, I'd say
she's pretty strange, period!

19:23.896 --> 19:25.531
The Pig 3: In fact...

19:25.531 --> 19:27.833
yikes.. she's a he!!!

19:27.833 --> 19:30.702
In the boss's bedroom.

19:30.702 --> 19:31.937
Grrrr!

19:31.937 --> 19:35.340
No wait, I'm the story
lady, remember?

There's nothing on this tape
but tall tales.

19:55.394 --> 19:57.396
Ralph and Melissa were right.

19:58.230 --> 20:01.733
I guess, I'm just not
cut out to be a reporter.

20:01.733 --> 20:03.869
Maybe if I tried to explain?

20:05.871 --> 20:07.773
Dear Ralph and Melissa,

20:08.373 --> 20:10.108
I know you won't believe me,

20:10.475 --> 20:12.811
and I don't blame you,
I guess...

20:13.779 --> 20:16.615
nobody will ever want

The Pig: You!!!

20:31.797 --> 20:32.931
What?

20:32.931 --> 20:35.133
Are you trying to tell me
it cost this much

20:35.133 --> 20:36.935
to pave a crummy forest?

20:36.935 --> 20:38.770
This is highway robbery!!

ordered it, you pay for it.

20:41.773 --> 20:43.108

The Pigs: She's here,
Sir, she's here.

The Pig: We got the story lady!

20:52.017 --> 20:54.853
I don't need you now! Get lost!

21:11.303 --> 21:13.138
The Pig: Well, Sir...
The Pig 2:

21:13.138 --> 21:15.941
It's like this, Sir.
He's a.. um...

21:15.941 --> 21:17.209
The Pigs: She...

You bumbling idiots,

21:18.543 --> 21:21.513

21:22.614 --> 21:24.316
Over my dead body!

21:24.316 --> 21:26.718
Now I've got to pave the forest,

21:26.718 --> 21:30.022

cost me a fortune. Oh!!

21:30.022 --> 21:34.226
Um, a minute, maybe
we can work something out.

21:34.226 --> 21:37.462
What?! With you? Never!

21:37.462 --> 21:40.399
The Pig: Oh, Sir,
maybe he has an idea.

I got other deliveries.

21:44.870 --> 21:46.405

21:46.405 --> 21:48.874
Um... what

21:48.874 --> 21:52.811
Oh, uh... just a
little business proposition.

21:53.979 --> 21:56.315
No tricks!
No tricks.

21:56.315 --> 21:59.017
Okay, start talking.

21:59.017 --> 22:00.485
And this had better be good!

22:03.088 --> 22:05.357
This is a
wonderful story, Bert.

22:05.357 --> 22:07.225
I'm sorry I ever doubted you.

22:07.225 --> 22:09.928

Why are you stopping?

22:54.806 --> 22:56.108
Lesson two?!
