Doing nothing, maybe.

00:15.340 --> 00:18.010
Ya know, I'm getting
pretty pissed off

00:18.060 --> 00:18.850
with being the only
bread winner around here.

00:19.930 --> 00:21.770
This is a profession.
Not a hobby.

00:21.810 --> 00:23.100
Look. I'm just--

00:23.140 --> 00:25.400
I'm waiting for someone okay.
So leave me alone.

00:30.570 --> 00:31.490
It's not Leslie.

00:31.530 --> 00:33.070
But it still isn't work,
is it?

00:33.110 --> 00:34.990
No. I don't-- It's just--

00:35.740 --> 00:36.700
I think I'm on a date.

00:36.740 --> 00:37.200
Maybe. I don't know.

She was in the Academy

00:40.950 --> 00:41.830

00:43.000 --> 00:43.330
The Academy.

00:50.460 --> 00:50.920
Now that's just really sad.

00:52.470 --> 00:54.760
Do you have me on speaker phone
with Sloan in the room?

00:54.800 --> 00:56.430
She needed a good laugh
from her Poppy.

00:56.470 --> 00:59.930
Hi Sloan. Uh, ignore your
grandfather, alright?

00:59.970 --> 01:01.310
Are we still gonna hang

01:01.350 --> 01:05.600

Sounds like a plan.

01:24.290 --> 01:25.370
You can't let him take me.

I think you have Jimmy
confused with

01:26.830 --> 01:28.330

more threatening like--

01:28.380 --> 01:29.630
a stone pigeon.

We have to go now.
You need to trust me, Jake.

08:32.670 --> 08:35.800
Mal, Malachy. Mr.
Doyle sir, please.

08:35.840 --> 08:36.970
You really want my help?

08:37.010 --> 08:38.010
Ow--

08:38.060 --> 08:40.180
Time to raise my
clearance level.

08:40.220 --> 08:42.270
I don't have that
kind of power.

08:42.310 --> 08:43.230
Well,

08:43.270 --> 08:44.190
best of luck with it.

08:44.230 --> 08:45.100
Okay, wait!

08:46.900 --> 08:48.110
Clearance granted.

08:49.320 --> 08:50.280
Huh?!

09:01.450 --> 09:02.870
Please get out.

09:02.910 --> 09:04.170
Come on.

09:06.580 --> 09:10.050
I'd have taken your GTO, since
it's more stylish, but--

09:11.050 --> 09:12.340
This one was hackable.

09:13.510 --> 09:14.590
I think it's time that
you and I had a

09:14.630 --> 09:15.680
"you tell me the
truth and I decide

09:15.720 --> 09:17.090
if I believe you" conversation.

09:20.350 --> 09:21.720
[Jake] So Jimmy says you're

09:21.770 --> 09:22.720
some kind
of master hacker?

09:22.770 --> 09:23.930
The Master Plumber.

09:23.980 --> 09:26.440
One of ten super hackers
in the whole world.

09:26.480 --> 09:27.850
Wow.
That's pretty impressive.

09:27.900 --> 09:29.820
It would be, if I was
the Master Plumber.

09:29.860 --> 09:31.610
So-- you're not?

09:32.070 --> 09:33.150
No.

09:33.190 --> 09:35.240
Okay, what about this Fed?
Emerson.

09:35.280 --> 09:36.410
He said that you stole
diamonds.

09:36.450 --> 09:37.660
He's in on it too.

09:37.700 --> 09:39.070
Why do you think he
pulled his gun?

09:39.120 --> 09:41.620
The whole false flag thing.
The cyber hacker event.

09:41.660 --> 09:41.700
Yes.

09:43.370 --> 09:46.210
You have to believe me. You
have to keep them away from me.

09:46.250 --> 09:47.460
Help me stop it, Jake.

09:47.500 --> 09:48.080
Sydney.

09:48.130 --> 09:49.460
Why me?

09:49.500 --> 09:50.880
You've always been the only
person I could trust.

09:55.510 --> 09:57.260
The Master Plumber's identity
has never been revealed.

09:57.930 --> 09:59.260
What if she's lying?

09:59.300 --> 10:01.800
If she is the Master Plumber,
this is a huge deal.

10:01.850 --> 10:03.850
Well, if it's true, it
explains why Jimmy's here.

10:03.890 --> 10:07.480
But I gotta say man, I've know
her since the Academy.

10:07.520 --> 10:09.440
She's wild and unpredictable,
yes, but--

10:10.310 --> 10:11.270
She's a really good person.

10:11.310 --> 10:12.900
Yeah. So is the
Master Plumber.

10:12.940 --> 10:15.190
She's famous for
transferring funds from CEO's

10:15.240 --> 10:17.360
bank accounts-- to
Children's Hospitals.

10:17.400 --> 10:18.820
Oh, and get this.
She was

10:18.860 --> 10:21.830
even the bot herder-- in the
Spamhaus DoD attacks.

10:22.240 --> 10:24.200
[ring]

10:26.450 --> 10:28.920
Hey there. So is Jimmy still
paying you to be his,

10:28.960 --> 10:30.630
you know, gentleman companion?

10:30.670 --> 10:32.790
You're in way over your head
on this one, son.

10:32.840 --> 10:34.840
I remembered who
that girl was.

10:34.880 --> 10:36.470
Sydney Morrison?

10:36.510 --> 10:38.010
Last time you two hung out,

10:38.050 --> 10:39.720
there was literally fireworks.

10:39.760 --> 10:41.720
Okay, I've said this
a million times.

10:41.760 --> 10:43.600
We didn't know they'd all go
off at the same time, alright?

10:44.770 --> 10:47.640
Besides, I just--
I can't turn her over to

10:47.680 --> 10:47.890
Jimmy yet.

10:49.480 --> 10:51.270
I gotta figure out if she's
telling the truth or not.

10:51.310 --> 10:53.320
Whatever you're about to say
is classified.

10:53.360 --> 10:54.610
Probably.

10:54.650 --> 10:55.610
Give my Sydney, Jake.

10:55.650 --> 10:56.610
Or what?

10:56.650 --> 10:58.450
Or, I'll shoot your Dad.

10:59.150 --> 11:00.200
Do it. I don't care.

11:00.240 --> 11:01.990
Doyle. Old pal.

11:02.490 --> 11:03.450
Listen.

11:03.490 --> 11:04.740
We need to meet.

11:04.780 --> 11:06.950
Now, in person,
somewhere neutral.

11:06.990 --> 11:10.080
Fine. Meet me at Hava Java
cafe in about ten minutes.

11:10.120 --> 11:12.380
Hey. I make the rules.
I'm the decider--

11:12.420 --> 11:13.710
er.

11:13.750 --> 11:15.380
Alright Jimmy. You decide
where we're gonna meet.

11:18.010 --> 11:19.880
Maybe this Hava Java
place will work.

11:19.930 --> 11:20.430
Excellent choice.

11:21.260 --> 11:22.390
I'll text you the address.

11:26.060 --> 11:27.020
You'll shoot his dad.

11:27.060 --> 11:28.390
I wasn't gonna do it.

11:28.430 --> 11:29.350
It's okay, Jimmy.

11:29.390 --> 11:30.390
It just means more hazard pay.

11:30.440 --> 11:32.020
I'll add it on to
your invoice.

11:34.900 --> 11:35.230
[Sydney] He's dangerous.

11:36.230 --> 11:37.280
Be careful they don't
flip you.

11:37.320 --> 11:38.610
Yeah. I'll look out for that.

11:39.320 --> 11:40.490
Do me a favor, will you?

11:40.530 --> 11:42.070
Check into Emerson.
See what you can find?

11:42.110 --> 11:44.320
Yeah, sure. I'll talk to
my contacts in the Feds.

11:44.370 --> 11:46.660
And Des, keep your eyes
on her at all times.

11:46.700 --> 11:48.700
And don't let her near
anything with a chip in it.

11:48.750 --> 11:50.000
Especially cell phones.

11:53.710 --> 11:55.250
I can't believe I might
be in the same room

11:55.290 --> 11:56.590
as the Master Plumber.

11:56.630 --> 11:57.960
You still think it's me?

11:58.510 --> 11:59.460
Maybe.

11:59.510 --> 12:00.420
I can't speak to that.
But--

12:01.430 --> 12:03.180
I feel like I understand
why she--

12:04.180 --> 12:06.430
Or he-- does what they do.

12:06.470 --> 12:08.930
Me too. Totally. Why?

12:08.970 --> 12:09.520
Even out the odds.

12:11.100 --> 12:13.270
The Master Plumber takes from
people who have everything.

12:13.310 --> 12:14.850
And gives it to those
who do not.

12:14.900 --> 12:17.730
Like a modern day
hacking Robin Hood.

12:18.980 --> 12:20.400
You don't think
she'd actually do anything

12:20.440 --> 12:21.700
to hurt anyone do you?

12:23.070 --> 12:24.870
Maybe if she was backed
into a corner.

12:25.620 --> 12:27.030
Or if she had no choice.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.160
Hey, hey, hey.

12:28.200 --> 12:29.160
Just checking the time.

12:29.200 --> 12:30.500
Well it's--
Don't touch o'clock.

12:30.540 --> 12:31.910
And you know, I may not have
caused

12:31.960 --> 12:33.420
any nationwide black outs.

12:33.460 --> 12:34.710
But I do possess

12:34.750 --> 12:39.300
some pretty legit
hacktivist chops myself.

12:39.340 --> 12:40.420
Do tell.

12:40.460 --> 12:42.840
Well, You know
Buy Nothing Day?

12:42.880 --> 12:44.720
The mass on-line event
protesting consumerism.

12:44.760 --> 12:45.760
That was you?

12:45.800 --> 12:46.760
Yeah, no.

12:46.800 --> 12:47.970
But I didn't buy
a thing that day.

12:48.470 --> 12:50.430
[ring]

12:51.770 --> 12:52.980
Oh, hi--

12:54.310 --> 12:55.310
Tinny.

12:55.350 --> 12:57.310
Tinny. Yes. Yes.
I knows you.

12:57.360 --> 12:59.110
Des, I just wanted to say--

12:59.150 --> 13:00.820
If you wanted some privacy,
I can just--

13:00.860 --> 13:01.780
No, you can't leave.

13:01.820 --> 13:02.740
[Tinny] What?

13:02.780 --> 13:03.860
Des, who is that?

13:03.900 --> 13:05.700
No one. It's just
some potentially

13:05.740 --> 13:08.240
world renowned super
hot hacker woman.

13:08.280 --> 13:09.660
Who might bring down
the world.

13:09.700 --> 13:12.450
So, anyway-- Or,
it's just the wind.

13:12.500 --> 13:13.370
I gotta go. I gotta go.

13:15.290 --> 13:16.210
Hey, hey, hey.

13:16.250 --> 13:17.290
Not so fast.
Not so fast.

13:22.670 --> 13:26.130
You. You are always, always,
in every conceivable way,

13:26.180 --> 13:28.050
a huge flaw in my ointment.

13:28.850 --> 13:30.720
- Okay.
- See? See?

13:30.760 --> 13:31.640
This is my problem.

13:31.680 --> 13:33.140
It's all attitude.

13:33.180 --> 13:35.890
When you have no business-es
having any attitude at all.

13:35.940 --> 13:37.350
Right.

13:37.400 --> 13:39.020
Do you need me to tell you how
much trouble you're in?

13:39.060 --> 13:40.070
Is that rhetorical?

13:40.110 --> 13:41.530
Oh don't get him
started on that.

13:41.570 --> 13:42.980
I am never rhetorical.

13:43.030 --> 13:45.240
I am anti-rhetorical,
if anything.

13:45.900 --> 13:47.820
Now. Where is she?

13:47.860 --> 13:48.780
I have an itchy throat.

13:48.820 --> 13:50.160
And I don't have time

13:50.200 --> 13:51.830
to explain the severity of
the situation to you.

13:51.870 --> 13:52.790
You got me?

13:52.830 --> 13:53.750
[Wolf]
Look Jake.

13:53.790 --> 13:55.660
I likes you.
We both do.

13:55.710 --> 13:56.920
But this is serious.

13:56.960 --> 13:58.080
Exactly.

13:58.120 --> 13:59.710
Lots of lives are at
stake here, Jake.

13:59.750 --> 14:00.960
So hurry up.
And come clean.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.460
And if you do--
For old times’ sake--

14:02.500 --> 14:04.380
I might just forget all the
trouble you put me through.

14:06.130 --> 14:07.590
B'ys. Honestly.

14:07.630 --> 14:09.720
I got dragged into this whole
thing against my will.

14:09.760 --> 14:11.970
I have no idea why Sydney was
running from you.

14:12.930 --> 14:14.390
Or any other details.
Sorry.

14:14.430 --> 14:15.480
Is he okay?

14:15.520 --> 14:16.690
Don't change the subject.

14:18.560 --> 14:20.560
Maybe you could give
me some details.

14:21.440 --> 14:22.360
And I'll fill in the blanks.

14:22.400 --> 14:23.940
No this is classified.

14:23.980 --> 14:25.150
Do you smell that?

14:26.030 --> 14:27.320
Gimme that. Gimme that!

14:27.360 --> 14:28.740
Protect the list?

14:28.780 --> 14:29.740
What list?

14:29.780 --> 14:30.950
Jimmy are you alright,
or what?

14:32.080 --> 14:32.990
Do you have any allergies?

14:33.030 --> 14:34.200
Like I would tell you.

14:34.240 --> 14:35.540
You'd use it against me.

14:37.290 --> 14:38.420
My God, my throat is closing.

14:38.460 --> 14:39.420
What are you allergic to?

14:39.460 --> 14:40.460
Is it itchy in here?

14:40.500 --> 14:41.500
He's allergic to peanuts.

14:41.540 --> 14:42.840
Not just peanuts. All nuts.

14:42.880 --> 14:44.380
No one seems to get that!

14:46.800 --> 14:47.300
This is almond milk.

14:48.380 --> 14:49.260
Buddy, someone's
trying to kill you.

14:50.140 --> 14:51.300
Do you have an allergy pen?

14:51.340 --> 14:52.350
Give it to me, quick!

14:59.480 --> 15:00.520
It looks like you hacked
our firewall.

15:01.650 --> 15:03.440
And got info on the
internal network.

15:04.820 --> 15:07.400
And then sent our current
location to a smartphone.

15:08.320 --> 15:10.030
Kinda like a penetration test.

15:10.070 --> 15:11.820
A lot like a penetration test.

15:12.740 --> 15:13.780
I'm sorry, Des.

15:13.830 --> 15:15.950
I feel so violated.
And impressed.

15:15.990 --> 15:18.370
You're her, aren't you? The
Master-- The Mistress--

15:18.410 --> 15:20.040
Of Plumbing.

15:20.080 --> 15:21.420
Just as advertised.

15:21.460 --> 15:22.420
Hey, hey.

15:22.460 --> 15:23.340
First off-- it's
called knocking.

15:24.460 --> 15:26.590
Secondly, she's
not going anywhere.

15:26.630 --> 15:28.130
Actually, I am.

15:29.760 --> 15:30.880
And so are you.

15:32.260 --> 15:33.510
No.

15:33.550 --> 15:34.760
Please.
I need him alive.

15:35.640 --> 15:36.310
That's not part of the plan.

15:37.060 --> 15:37.980
I have a third option.

15:39.060 --> 15:39.730
But we can talk about
that later.

15:40.940 --> 15:43.060
[Jimmy] Jake! Jake,
what are you doing?

15:43.100 --> 15:44.310
He could die, Jake.

15:44.360 --> 15:45.610
No, actually, he's got
about five minutes

15:45.650 --> 15:46.940
before death sets in.

15:46.980 --> 15:48.440
And I want some answers.

15:48.490 --> 15:49.610
[muffled]
Answers about what?

15:49.650 --> 15:50.950
This is rotten,
Jake, b'y.

15:50.990 --> 15:52.160
Emerson. Who is he?

15:52.200 --> 15:53.950
No. That is classified.

15:53.990 --> 15:56.660
He worked with us.
Years ago.

15:56.700 --> 15:58.200
Trained with us, okay?
Now give me the pen!

15:58.240 --> 15:59.870
Alright. Have either one of
you used one of these before?

15:59.910 --> 16:00.960
No.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.500
Okay. Stand him up.
Quick!

16:04.000 --> 16:04.920
Now.

16:04.960 --> 16:05.920
Pull down his pants.

16:05.960 --> 16:07.500
What was that now?

16:07.550 --> 16:09.170
Take off his pants
or he's gonna die!

16:13.090 --> 16:14.090
Underwear too.

16:14.140 --> 16:15.100
No underwear!

16:15.140 --> 16:16.260
Gross.

16:16.850 --> 16:17.760
Underwear!

16:17.810 --> 16:18.680
Here.

16:19.520 --> 16:20.850
Stab him once. And then--

16:20.890 --> 16:21.940
Stab a bunch more times.

16:21.980 --> 16:23.100
No! No! No!

16:23.150 --> 16:24.150
Arrgh!

16:24.190 --> 16:25.150
Arrgh! Arrgh!

16:25.190 --> 16:26.190
Arrgh! Arrgh! Arrgh!

16:33.490 --> 16:34.910
I coulda jabbed him through
the jeans, couldn't I?

16:34.950 --> 16:36.450
No idea, honestly.

16:36.490 --> 16:38.290
But, it's the little things that
get me through the day Wolf

16:38.330 --> 16:39.290
[ring]

16:41.080 --> 16:42.620
Emerson's got Des and Sydney.

16:43.710 --> 16:45.170
He's gonna use them
to get the list.

16:45.210 --> 16:46.630
Once he gets the list--

16:47.880 --> 16:49.250
Des is expendable.

16:52.220 --> 16:52.720
[Jimmy] You're unbelievable.

16:52.760 --> 16:54.300
Unbelievable!

16:54.340 --> 16:56.220
As long as you learned something
Jimmy. That's the main thing.

16:56.260 --> 16:58.180
Learning! You
coulda killed me.

16:58.220 --> 16:58.510
And it was perverted.

16:59.770 --> 17:01.220
It was pretty funny, Jimmy.
I'm just saying.

17:01.270 --> 17:03.310
We need more info if we're
gonna find Des.

17:03.350 --> 17:04.940
No. No more info.

17:04.980 --> 17:06.270
This is classified.

17:06.310 --> 17:09.070
Look. I don't care what's
arbitrarily classified

17:09.110 --> 17:10.900
or not classified
in your head, Jimmy.

17:12.070 --> 17:13.570
Are you gonna help
up find Des or not?

17:13.610 --> 17:15.950
Emerson and Sydney are
obviously working together.

17:16.620 --> 17:17.950
What do they want?

17:20.120 --> 17:21.580
They're after a list.

17:21.620 --> 17:22.580
[Jimmy] A list of
cover identities.

17:23.910 --> 17:26.330
Of more than a hundred active
undercover agents

17:27.170 --> 17:28.330
embedded around the world.

17:28.380 --> 17:30.630
Not just names.
Complete files.

17:30.670 --> 17:31.300
Including current locations?

17:32.710 --> 17:34.340
[Jake] Why would Sydney be
tangled up in something

17:34.380 --> 17:36.300
like this? I mean, she works
for Government Intelligence.

17:36.340 --> 17:37.140
Oh. Sydney forgot

17:37.180 --> 17:38.470
to tell you, Jake.

17:38.510 --> 17:40.890
She hasn't worked for the
government for a month.

17:40.930 --> 17:43.100
She's played you
like an idiot violin.

17:43.140 --> 17:44.060
Ow!

17:44.100 --> 17:45.190
What happened with her?

17:45.230 --> 17:46.730
She was forced out over

17:46.770 --> 17:50.440
allegations... that she's
the Master Plumber.

17:51.020 --> 17:52.360
Emerson. Rogue

17:52.400 --> 17:54.490
Federal Agent.
What's the story there?

17:54.530 --> 17:56.650
He was with our team.
I trained him.

17:56.700 --> 17:58.110
So he's highly skilled.

17:58.160 --> 17:58.200
And extremely
dangerous.

17:59.950 --> 18:01.910
The list is hidden digitally in
the main frame computer system.

18:03.290 --> 18:05.080
It's the most secure and
reliable place to have it.

18:05.120 --> 18:06.410
[Jake]
You need a master hacker

18:06.460 --> 18:07.500
to be able to
access it.

18:07.540 --> 18:08.880
If there's a top secret

18:08.920 --> 18:11.170
government mainframe in
Saint Johns we'll find it.

18:11.210 --> 18:12.750
Hey.
I just got a hit on Patil.

18:12.800 --> 18:14.800
He's a retired
intelligence officer.

18:15.380 --> 18:16.760
Director level.

18:16.800 --> 18:19.300
Sydney wasn't at that fundraiser
to steal those diamonds

18:19.340 --> 18:21.180
We finally agree on
something, Doyle.

18:22.760 --> 18:23.810
Come on.

18:27.060 --> 18:28.060
[Jake] Looks like Sydney
patched into this.

18:29.100 --> 18:30.060
[Patil]
That's a retinal scanner.

18:30.100 --> 18:31.900
I got an employee
discount--

18:31.940 --> 18:33.900
And you need a retinal scanner
because--

18:33.940 --> 18:37.490
I miss the gadgets.
And the life of intrigue.

18:37.530 --> 18:38.860
A rectal scanner?

18:39.280 --> 18:40.280
[beeping]

18:40.320 --> 18:41.870
I'm late for a
best-ball foursome.

18:43.040 --> 18:44.290
Don't touch
anything inside the vault.

18:44.330 --> 18:45.450
It's pressure sensitive.

18:45.500 --> 18:46.540
What does that mean?

18:47.460 --> 18:48.750
Can you explain to me why your

18:48.790 --> 18:50.500
ex-partner is starting
a world war?

18:50.540 --> 18:52.840
Honestly?
I don't know, Jake.

18:53.840 --> 18:54.840
I thought, as
brothers-in-arms.

18:56.130 --> 18:57.510
There was something between
Emerson and me.

18:57.550 --> 18:58.430
Gimme that.

19:00.140 --> 19:00.890
How dangerous is he?

19:02.100 --> 19:04.430
I mean, what's Des up against?
Seriously.

19:05.180 --> 19:06.270
I thought I knew him.

19:07.310 --> 19:09.140
But now, I don't know anymore.

19:14.400 --> 19:16.030
I think you actually need
a brain for it to work.

19:17.360 --> 19:18.240
You know, he confirmed that
nothing was taken.

19:19.910 --> 19:22.070
From what I know of Sydney, she
doesn't keep anything she hacks.

19:22.110 --> 19:23.820
She gives everything away
to the poor.

19:23.870 --> 19:26.540
I still can't figure out how she
could be tangled up in all this.

19:28.120 --> 19:30.620
[Jimmy] So-- She showed she
could heist the diamonds.

19:31.370 --> 19:32.540
Then she gave them back.

19:33.460 --> 19:34.290
To break into a bedroom vault?

19:35.630 --> 19:37.380
Doesn't seem like much
of a challenge for her.

19:38.300 --> 19:39.380
Just do not touch anything.

19:41.180 --> 19:43.180
How many times have we
been over this? I'm in charge.

19:43.220 --> 19:44.470
Stop the ordering of me.

19:45.260 --> 19:46.260
Buddy, what's his name?

19:46.310 --> 19:47.310
Patil.

19:47.350 --> 19:48.180
Patil's eyeballs.

19:49.600 --> 19:52.190
Sydney wasn't trying to gain
access to this vault.

19:52.230 --> 19:53.350
She wanted the retina scanner.

19:53.400 --> 19:55.400
That's why the panel
was loose outside.

19:55.440 --> 19:58.860
She needed the data from the
eyeball scanner thing.

19:58.900 --> 19:59.820
[ring]

19:59.860 --> 20:00.740
It's government property.

20:03.320 --> 20:04.780
Dad, what do you got?

20:04.820 --> 20:07.410
We've narrowed down possible
locations for the mainframe.

20:07.450 --> 20:10.080
Based on some unique
hardware requests.

20:10.120 --> 20:11.040
Let me guess.
A retinal scanner.

20:11.080 --> 20:12.460
Yes.

20:12.500 --> 20:14.880
With the data Sydney got from
the eyeball scanner,

20:14.920 --> 20:16.170
she can access
the mainframe.

20:16.210 --> 20:17.380
Jimmy, don't touch that!

20:19.420 --> 20:20.340
What? It wasn't me.

20:20.970 --> 20:22.220
Ahh!

20:27.810 --> 20:30.430
[Sydney] And I said the
government had no imagination.

20:30.480 --> 20:31.600
Find the door.

20:37.400 --> 20:38.730
The signal's auto jamming.

20:38.780 --> 20:39.730
Very impressive.

20:39.780 --> 20:40.990
Can you crack it--

20:41.030 --> 20:42.570
in less than
four minutes?

20:42.610 --> 20:43.950
That's how long you
said the cameras

20:43.990 --> 20:45.200
would hold on
the cloned footage.

20:45.240 --> 20:46.200
Yeah. I'll get it.

20:46.780 --> 20:48.370
Okay. No tricks.

20:49.490 --> 20:51.290
I even smell betrayal
in your mind,

20:52.330 --> 20:53.710
well, you know what
will happen.

20:54.620 --> 20:55.830
What's he talking about?

20:55.880 --> 20:57.920
Nothing. What
are you looking at?

20:57.960 --> 21:01.720
Oh, just the fines on these
books are gonna be ridiculous.

21:03.720 --> 21:05.010
These are all library books.

21:05.050 --> 21:07.600
Like someone bought them
to use as props.

21:24.950 --> 21:25.530
And they said it
couldn't be done.

21:26.820 --> 21:29.280
So arrogant they didn't even
beef up security.

21:29.330 --> 21:30.580
Oh, I'm going
straight to hell.

21:31.660 --> 21:33.330
Right after Jake fires me
of course.

21:35.080 --> 21:35.960
Ow.

21:37.170 --> 21:38.880
It looks so
small from the other--

21:38.920 --> 21:40.000
[Sydney]
This is what it's like

21:40.040 --> 21:41.300
to be a field agent.

21:42.300 --> 21:43.300
Plumber.
You got twenty minutes.

21:43.340 --> 21:44.550
To make history.

21:50.350 --> 21:53.640
I am aware that there's
an unwritten code.

21:53.680 --> 21:55.640
No telling tales
out of school.

21:55.690 --> 21:57.650
Plus all that top
secret stuff--

21:57.690 --> 21:58.980
I can't break the code, Rose.

21:59.610 --> 22:00.610
I know.

22:01.690 --> 22:02.650
I know.

22:02.690 --> 22:03.980
But it would
certainly help

22:04.030 --> 22:06.650
Jake bring Des back if you
could tell me

22:06.700 --> 22:08.240
What Jimmy means to Emerson.

22:09.660 --> 22:11.280
Do you have the file or not?

22:12.370 --> 22:14.910
You're out now. Let it go.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.330
I'm afraid I can't do that.

22:18.420 --> 22:19.750
You have until tonight.

22:23.340 --> 22:24.380
[Wolf]
The boss'll kill me.

22:25.170 --> 22:26.380
I can't say anything.

22:30.680 --> 22:32.510
Okay. So you're gonna help me.
You just can't speak.

22:36.390 --> 22:38.940
Every time you take a sip.
That's a yes. Okay.

22:40.860 --> 22:43.530
Is Jimmy responsible for
Emerson going rogue?

22:44.110 --> 22:45.480
That's a no.

22:45.530 --> 22:46.900
Where they on a mission
together?

22:48.860 --> 22:50.570
Yeah.
Did something go wrong?

22:52.910 --> 22:53.790
Okay.

22:55.160 --> 22:58.540
Would Emerson kill Des?

23:05.210 --> 23:05.920
What does that mean?

23:07.300 --> 23:08.930
It means there's not enough
sugar in the coffee.

23:18.480 --> 23:19.100
What are you doing?

23:20.270 --> 23:22.690
I'm conserving air.
Please don't talk.

23:22.730 --> 23:23.520
I will remain silent as well.

23:24.440 --> 23:25.780
We'll see how long that lasts.

23:27.320 --> 23:27.940
You know this whole time--

23:29.030 --> 23:30.860
You haven't made one
redhead joke.

23:31.610 --> 23:32.740
It's quite impressive.

23:32.780 --> 23:35.160
Considering it's your
go-to insult.

23:36.410 --> 23:37.330
Yeah, well.

23:38.500 --> 23:39.830
You know what's
really, really crazy?

23:41.120 --> 23:41.370
Besides Emerson?

23:42.500 --> 23:45.210
Do you know,
that in a hundred years

23:45.250 --> 23:47.300
there may be no more redheads
left on the planet

23:48.590 --> 23:50.510
Due to our extraordinary,
yet recessive gene.

23:51.640 --> 23:53.680
Can you imagine that?
Can you imagine?

23:53.720 --> 23:55.220
I may be the last of me.

23:56.140 --> 23:57.310
How tragic.

23:59.480 --> 24:00.350
So how's Leslie?

24:01.390 --> 24:02.310
What happened to your whole

24:02.350 --> 24:03.810
"I'm conserving air" thing?

24:03.850 --> 24:06.110
Just trying to catch up.
Is that so wrong?

24:06.860 --> 24:06.900
Okay, look.

24:08.530 --> 24:11.650
She's married to a dead guy,
who turned out to be not dead.

24:11.700 --> 24:12.570
Happy?

24:13.490 --> 24:14.160
Sounds complicated.

24:15.240 --> 24:16.740
And to further
complicate things--

24:18.160 --> 24:18.750
I have a new daughter.

24:20.290 --> 24:23.790
Jake! Congrats, man. That's
excellent. How many months?

24:24.210 --> 24:25.130
Sixteen.

24:25.670 --> 24:26.210
Years.

24:27.380 --> 24:28.630
Actually, now that
I think about it...

24:30.590 --> 24:31.880
Leslie's now divorced.

24:33.220 --> 24:34.800
In the time you just
told me that?

24:37.970 --> 24:38.850
Stay on your side.

24:41.310 --> 24:44.020
Jimmy. There are no sides.

24:44.060 --> 24:48.320
There's just you and me trapped
in this vault because of you.

24:48.360 --> 24:50.150
And I'm just trying to
get us out of here.

24:53.780 --> 24:55.450
Now, now, now, now.
Jimmy.

24:56.910 --> 24:57.990
What was that?

24:58.030 --> 24:59.080
Is there blood?

24:59.120 --> 25:00.500
I can't clock properly
without air.

25:04.750 --> 25:06.670
It turns out your head is good
for something.

25:06.710 --> 25:07.840
What are you doing with that?

25:12.630 --> 25:14.180
Looks like our man
wanted to save some money

25:14.220 --> 25:15.220
on his wife's bedroom safe.

25:16.050 --> 25:17.350
Gyp-rock
is a heluva lot

25:17.390 --> 25:19.140
cheaper than
reinforced steel.

25:26.350 --> 25:27.270
Is that it?

25:28.270 --> 25:29.190
Where'd it go?

25:29.230 --> 25:30.150
Help me find it, Des.

25:30.190 --> 25:31.860
Sure. I can find anything.

25:31.900 --> 25:33.320
I was the Regional Scavenger
Hunt Champion.

25:33.360 --> 25:34.610
We almost went to the
Nationals.

25:35.570 --> 25:36.700
[Sydney]
The mainframe just had

25:36.740 --> 25:38.200
a panic attack and
destroyed the file.

25:38.240 --> 25:39.200
Is that going to be a problem?

25:39.240 --> 25:40.660
No, it only does that when it

25:40.700 --> 25:42.790
still has proof that it exists
somewhere in this office.

25:42.830 --> 25:43.790
[Sydney]
Exactly.

25:43.830 --> 25:44.870
[Des]
And the mainframe just

25:44.910 --> 25:46.370
told us where that
somewhere is.

25:46.420 --> 25:47.330
Follow me.

25:47.380 --> 25:48.840
This is why he's here.

25:51.710 --> 25:51.800
[Jake] Yeah.

25:52.960 --> 25:55.260
So Jake. Emerson
isn't just a rogue Fed.

25:55.300 --> 25:57.590
He was on Jimmy's team when
a mission went bad.

25:58.300 --> 25:59.470
So it's personal.

25:59.510 --> 26:00.560
Looks like it.

26:00.600 --> 26:01.310
Are we there yet?

26:01.350 --> 26:02.970
I gotta go.

26:03.020 --> 26:05.850
Look to keep your mind occupied
why don't you sit on your hands

26:05.890 --> 26:07.650
And count to
a hundred to yourself.

26:13.280 --> 26:14.400
The only copy of the list

26:14.440 --> 26:16.280
is in a fail safe
somewhere in this office.

26:16.320 --> 26:18.240
What does that mean?
Where is it?

26:18.280 --> 26:20.120
It may have been written
to a flash drive.

26:20.160 --> 26:20.990
I don't see
a flash drive.

26:21.780 --> 26:21.990
You have three minutes.

26:23.540 --> 26:25.370
I don't have to tell you what
it means if we get caught.

26:26.250 --> 26:28.170
No way!
I always wanted

26:28.210 --> 26:29.290
one of
these guys.

26:35.630 --> 26:38.090
I saw one of these at the last
Hack-In-The-Box Convention.

26:39.510 --> 26:41.550
Government Intelligence is
really up on their gear.

26:41.600 --> 26:44.060
Oh, we are at the top
of Mount Everest-

26:44.100 --> 26:45.020
Of hacking, I mean.

26:45.060 --> 26:46.060
And criminal activity.

26:46.640 --> 26:47.560
Toss it to me.

26:51.440 --> 26:52.900
I should have known
this was coming.

26:53.650 --> 26:54.570
Over here.

26:54.610 --> 26:55.490
On the floor.

26:56.740 --> 26:57.610
Both of you.

26:58.200 --> 26:59.160
Down.

26:59.200 --> 27:00.070
Jeez!

27:04.950 --> 27:05.830
Ow!

27:10.080 --> 27:12.960
The Master Plumber
and her accomplice--

27:14.420 --> 27:15.420
have scaled their final
mountain.

27:15.920 --> 27:16.880
They have?

27:16.920 --> 27:17.880
Accomplice?

27:17.920 --> 27:19.630
Oh man.
Jake is gonna kill me.

27:19.670 --> 27:22.260
You can let him go. I'll do
whatever else you need me to do.

27:22.300 --> 27:23.600
When the Feds came,

27:24.850 --> 27:26.220
they had a
message for them.

27:26.270 --> 27:28.230
We won't say anything
if you don't?

27:30.020 --> 27:31.350
No. No. No!
I don't want it!

27:31.400 --> 27:32.310
I don't want it!

27:32.360 --> 27:33.400
Oomph!

27:44.740 --> 27:47.040
I've been wanting to do that
since we first met.

27:47.620 --> 27:48.250
As for our deal?

27:49.370 --> 27:51.290
You can die knowing your
family didn't.

27:52.170 --> 27:53.040
Oomph!

28:04.760 --> 28:06.180
Right on schedule, Jimmy.

28:07.640 --> 28:09.430
It's like I know you better
than you know yourself.

28:09.480 --> 28:10.770
Well, the joke's
on you, Emerson,

28:10.810 --> 28:11.310
Because I don't
really know myself.

28:12.690 --> 28:14.480
I should just punch you
in the face, right now.

28:15.520 --> 28:16.730
[Jake]
It's obvious that you

28:16.770 --> 28:17.940
two have a lot of
catching up to do.

28:19.320 --> 28:21.070
So, if you'll just tell me
where my friends are--

28:25.240 --> 28:29.040
Or we can stay here and
go down memory lane.

28:30.120 --> 28:31.870
Obviously Jimmy
is annoying to the

28:31.910 --> 28:34.210
point that you wanna kill
him. But think about it.

28:34.250 --> 28:35.330
You have so much
history together.

28:35.380 --> 28:36.630
You were in the same unit.

28:36.670 --> 28:37.670
You're not helping me, Jake.

28:37.710 --> 28:38.880
Yes, we were.

28:39.960 --> 28:40.840
Isn't that right,
Jimmy?

28:41.590 --> 28:42.340
[Jake]
Look Pally.

28:43.180 --> 28:43.760
Just tell me where Des is.

28:44.550 --> 28:45.510
Des [muffled]
Hmmm!

28:47.140 --> 28:49.770
Don't worry. You'll
find them together.

28:53.730 --> 28:54.770
Now that's a good friend.

29:03.360 --> 29:04.320
This is what you want.

29:05.490 --> 29:07.990
Are you willing to leave
him behind to die

29:08.030 --> 29:09.830
in order to
complete your mission?

29:10.620 --> 29:11.370
Jake stop!

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
No, Jimmy, Jimmy!

29:16.250 --> 29:17.420
Nobody move.

29:18.500 --> 29:20.050
Des, buddy.
Don't panic.

29:20.630 --> 29:21.840
Stay with me.

29:26.180 --> 29:27.100
Your vest.
Gimme your vest.

29:33.140 --> 29:33.890
Stay still.

29:34.390 --> 29:35.440
Calm down.

29:35.480 --> 29:36.600
Okay. This is gonna hurt.

29:39.230 --> 29:42.150
Slowly--
Drop it into the vest.

29:46.070 --> 29:46.990
Now!

29:50.370 --> 29:51.620
[boom]

29:58.830 --> 29:59.500
Your welcome.

30:00.130 --> 30:01.210
That was intense!

30:01.250 --> 30:02.460
I told you he'd come for me.

30:03.920 --> 30:04.550
Emerson's got the list?

30:04.880 --> 30:06.430
Yeah.

30:06.470 --> 30:07.930
With the identities of more than
a hundred undercover agents.

30:09.350 --> 30:11.470
And everyone on it is dead,
if we don't get it back.

30:15.310 --> 30:16.560
[Leslie] Emerson has the list?

30:16.600 --> 30:18.850
He's got the real names
and current locations

30:18.900 --> 30:20.230
of undercover agents
embedded around the world.

30:21.400 --> 30:21.980
Something like that would
be priceless.

30:23.480 --> 30:25.690
Wouldn't Emerson try and sell
it to the highest bidder?

30:25.740 --> 30:27.400
We don't know what his
next move is yet.

30:27.450 --> 30:28.910
But if that list goes public,

30:28.950 --> 30:31.080
everyone on it will
be dead within hours.

30:31.120 --> 30:32.830
I'll put an APB out
for Emerson.

30:32.870 --> 30:33.490
Hopefully we'll get lucky.

30:34.620 --> 30:36.040
It's good to see you again,
corporal.

30:40.210 --> 30:42.090
So if you two aren't
a thingy at the moment--

30:42.130 --> 30:44.170
Don't say another word.
Or I'll cut your tongue out.

30:44.920 --> 30:45.880
Let's go talk to Sydney.

30:45.920 --> 30:46.840
Let's do it.

30:46.880 --> 30:47.720
Wait.

30:48.800 --> 30:50.720
I need a minute,
with you. Out here.

30:54.060 --> 30:55.310
[Des]
Hey, when this is all over,

30:55.350 --> 30:56.600
I gotta tell you about
my Plumbing exploits,

30:56.640 --> 30:57.690
I kissed Grayson.

30:57.730 --> 30:58.850
You killed Grayson?

30:59.480 --> 31:01.980
I kissed Grayson.

31:02.570 --> 31:03.520
What?

31:03.570 --> 31:04.610
I mean, he kissed me,

31:04.650 --> 31:06.950
But--
It happened.

31:08.200 --> 31:09.400
Are you going to tear
my heart out?

31:09.450 --> 31:10.410
'Cause I'd really rather
you didn't do that.

31:11.160 --> 31:12.700
No. Of course not, but--

31:13.700 --> 31:14.450
What we're doing
scares me, Des.

31:15.620 --> 31:18.210
Tinny, a lot of things
scare me, okay?

31:18.750 --> 31:18.790
Like Jake--

31:20.330 --> 31:22.250
silently standing over my
bed at night when he finds out

31:22.290 --> 31:23.750
about us.
But you know what doesn't

31:23.790 --> 31:25.760
scare me? The thought
of me and you--

31:26.460 --> 31:27.550
hanging out.

31:27.590 --> 31:30.630
In my new, freshly
painted aqua blue

31:30.680 --> 31:32.680
pad. You're favorite
color, by the way.

31:33.300 --> 31:34.600
So-- Are we okay?

31:36.060 --> 31:40.480
Yeah. I should confess,
though. I've been flirting--

31:41.480 --> 31:43.610
pretty heavily myself,
lately.

31:44.230 --> 31:45.400
Can we promise--

31:45.440 --> 31:47.440
It'll never happen again.

31:54.120 --> 31:54.910
What's the deal with Emerson?

31:55.790 --> 31:57.040
Is he gone off the deep end?

31:57.080 --> 31:57.580
I don't know.

31:58.410 --> 32:00.790
Jake, he was a good agent.

32:00.830 --> 32:02.580
Smart, worked hard.

32:02.620 --> 32:03.880
A guy you
could really rely on.

32:05.170 --> 32:08.420
But, things changed when
a mission went sideways.

32:08.460 --> 32:09.800
How sideways?

32:09.840 --> 32:11.180
It was an asset extraction

32:11.220 --> 32:12.090
in South America.

32:12.130 --> 32:12.180
It was routine,

32:13.470 --> 32:15.510
until the extraction
point got compromised.

32:16.600 --> 32:18.350
And Emerson was left behind.

32:18.390 --> 32:19.100
The mission came first.

32:20.230 --> 32:21.810
Feds disavowed any
knowledge of him--

32:21.850 --> 32:22.600
or his connection
to the unit.

32:23.770 --> 32:25.560
I guess he took it
kind of personally.

32:25.610 --> 32:28.360
So now he wants revenge on every
undercover agent on that list?

32:28.400 --> 32:30.490
Maybe. Or at least the guys
from our unit.

32:31.570 --> 32:32.950
You guys gotta come see this.

32:37.200 --> 32:38.620
[Jake]
His real name is Elvis?

32:38.660 --> 32:39.580
Wolf's cover is blown.

32:39.620 --> 32:40.910
And it's all my fault.

32:40.950 --> 32:42.960
This was leaked on-line
five minutes ago.

32:43.000 --> 32:43.460
He's gotta disappear.

32:44.880 --> 32:46.750
We gotta get him to a safe
house before he's busted.

32:46.790 --> 32:48.630
He can lay low at my office.
He'll be safe there.

32:48.670 --> 32:50.710
How do we know that this leak
came from the list--

32:50.760 --> 32:51.670
that Emerson stole?

32:52.630 --> 32:53.590
There was a video.

32:54.430 --> 32:55.050
Congratulations, Jimmy.

32:56.390 --> 32:58.140
You just made your first
difficult choice.

32:58.970 --> 32:59.890
Now here's another one.

33:00.930 --> 33:02.060
I'll release another name

33:02.100 --> 33:03.640
from the
list every hour

33:03.690 --> 33:04.730
unless we meet.

33:05.310 --> 33:06.270
You and me.

33:07.020 --> 33:07.900
Alone.

33:12.280 --> 33:13.650
[ring]

33:15.240 --> 33:16.370
[Jake] Dad. Emerson--

33:16.410 --> 33:18.120
outed Wolf. And now he's
coming for Jimmy.

33:18.160 --> 33:20.450
So it's revenge.
Pretty extreme.

33:20.490 --> 33:21.450
Seems like he's after

33:21.500 --> 33:22.910
everybody
from his old unit.

33:22.960 --> 33:24.500
Any idea where
Emerson's hiding?

33:24.540 --> 33:25.830
No, but I'm gonna send
you a video.

33:25.870 --> 33:27.170
And listen, see if
you can use it to

33:27.210 --> 33:28.420
pinpoint his location. Okay?

33:29.500 --> 33:30.800
Call me if you find
out anything.

33:30.840 --> 33:32.720
Okay. We'll let you know when
we have something.

33:34.930 --> 33:36.380
We don't have anymore
time, Jake.

33:36.430 --> 33:38.350
I know what I need to do to
make this right.

33:38.390 --> 33:39.260
Wait.

33:39.970 --> 33:41.720
Emerson is insane.

33:41.770 --> 33:42.850
If you go after him,

33:42.890 --> 33:43.560
he's gonna kill you.
And--

33:44.730 --> 33:46.900
I know we've had
our differences, Jimmy.

33:46.940 --> 33:49.230
But I actually don't want
you to die. Sue me.

33:52.230 --> 33:53.610
We got a hit on
that car matching

33:53.650 --> 33:55.150
the description Des gave us.

33:55.200 --> 33:57.450
It was found near Witless Bay
off Highway Fifty.

33:58.820 --> 34:00.030
[Jimmy] The bad news
is, it's burned out.

34:00.080 --> 34:01.370
He knows
what he's doing.

34:01.410 --> 34:03.000
Switches vehicles.
Leaves no trace of evidence.

34:04.620 --> 34:07.750
How do we get information out of
Miss Refuses to Talk in there?

34:08.170 --> 34:09.090
I'll--

34:10.000 --> 34:12.050
Do you mind
if we kind of...

34:12.090 --> 34:13.460
Do you mind if I talk to her--

34:13.510 --> 34:14.380
for a minute?

34:22.430 --> 34:23.850
I heard you were married
to a dead guy

34:23.890 --> 34:25.140
who turned out not to be dead.

34:26.850 --> 34:30.020
Yeah, that came out a lot less
smoothly than I wanted it--

34:31.360 --> 34:32.070
--to, you know,

34:32.530 --> 34:33.780
come out.

34:35.400 --> 34:36.320
I'll be...

34:36.360 --> 34:37.280
I'm gonna--

34:37.320 --> 34:39.070
Is it.. if?
Yeah.

34:42.870 --> 34:44.700
We've had quite the reunion,
haven't we, Jake?

34:45.910 --> 34:47.540
It's too bad we didn't go
on a proper date.

34:47.580 --> 34:48.710
That would have
been fun, huh?

34:50.040 --> 34:50.920
[Jake] Yeah.

34:54.300 --> 34:56.720
How in God's name did you get
tangled up in all of this?

34:57.420 --> 34:58.840
The hacking? Or--

34:58.880 --> 35:00.890
Or putting all those agents
lives at risk.

35:02.300 --> 35:05.220
Emerson found out who I was.
He's blackmailing me.

35:05.260 --> 35:07.440
He said he'd kill my mother and
my sister if I didn't help him.

35:08.350 --> 35:09.150
Why didn't you go to the cops?

35:10.270 --> 35:11.690
If I did, he'd have had
them killed.

35:12.690 --> 35:14.110
You don't know this guy.
He's as

35:14.150 --> 35:15.320
dangerous as they come.

35:16.070 --> 35:17.200
I had no other choice.

35:18.400 --> 35:19.530
You gotta help me find him.

35:21.450 --> 35:23.950
Just think about all the lives
that are at stake here.

35:24.660 --> 35:25.580
You're not a killer.

35:25.620 --> 35:27.330
No. I'm not.

35:28.710 --> 35:30.630
Let's take this maniac down.

35:38.260 --> 35:39.550
We need to get her a laptop.

35:39.590 --> 35:40.840
Can we trust her with one?

35:40.880 --> 35:43.680
Probably not. But
it's our only chance.

35:44.930 --> 35:45.810
Where is Jimmy?

35:56.190 --> 35:57.150
Emerson?

35:58.900 --> 36:00.450
[Emerson]
I'm impressed, Jimmy.

36:02.030 --> 36:02.950
You got stones.

36:10.540 --> 36:11.580
See, I like this weapon.

36:12.120 --> 36:13.000
Old school.

36:14.500 --> 36:15.710
Five in the chamber.

36:17.340 --> 36:18.170
We can end this now.

36:18.920 --> 36:20.090
Just give me the list.

36:20.130 --> 36:22.220
That's exactly what
I'm gonna do, Jimmy.

36:23.050 --> 36:24.260
End this.

36:28.180 --> 36:30.020
[Jake] Des. I need a
location on Emerson.

36:30.060 --> 36:30.690
Copy. We're on it.

36:32.270 --> 36:34.600
The flash drive that Sydney
gave Emerson has files on it.

36:34.650 --> 36:37.730
And I was able to track its
Wi-Fi signal before so

36:37.770 --> 36:39.190
I will be able
to do it again.

36:39.230 --> 36:40.690
Can you get me some
coordinates?

36:40.740 --> 36:42.990
The best we can give you is
that he's somewhere between

36:43.030 --> 36:45.200
Topsail Road and
Pitts Memorial Drive

36:45.240 --> 36:47.240
Great. So it's the
entirety of the west end.

36:47.280 --> 36:49.950
Okay. Wait, wait, wait.
He is in the...

36:50.870 --> 36:52.370
Bowring Park area.

36:52.410 --> 36:54.000
Okay, if you narrow it down
any further, let me know.

36:54.040 --> 36:55.380
I got Dad calling me.
Hang on.

36:56.170 --> 36:57.500
Skipper, what do you got?

36:57.540 --> 36:59.250
You were on to something
with that video.

36:59.300 --> 37:01.300
It looks like it was taken
in a greenhouse.

37:01.340 --> 37:03.050
Is there a greenhouse
at Bowring Park?

37:03.090 --> 37:04.010
Yeah. A big one.

37:04.050 --> 37:05.300
Alright. I'm on my way.

37:05.340 --> 37:06.430
Let's just hope
I'm not too late.

37:09.220 --> 37:09.810
[click]

37:10.850 --> 37:12.060
Do you remember this game,
Jimmy?

37:12.100 --> 37:12.810
I taught you

37:12.850 --> 37:13.980
this technique.

37:14.020 --> 37:15.690
Remember, there's no
bullets in the gun.

37:15.730 --> 37:17.770
Oh, I modified the technique
a little bit, Jimmy.

37:18.820 --> 37:20.480
Getting left behind
gave me lots

37:20.530 --> 37:21.690
of time to think
outside the box.

37:22.400 --> 37:23.860
How outside the box?

37:24.280 --> 37:25.110
[click,]

37:26.240 --> 37:27.990
You have two more
chances to find out.

37:28.030 --> 37:30.200
Just give up the list.
You already have me.

37:31.450 --> 37:32.370
That's kind of a good idea.

37:39.710 --> 37:40.880
You did the right thing.

37:40.920 --> 37:42.340
I don't want the list,
Jimmy.

37:43.380 --> 37:44.840
I want the name
that's not on it.

37:44.880 --> 37:45.430
Who's that?

37:46.300 --> 37:47.680
The last member of our team.

37:48.850 --> 37:50.260
Then I can finally take
care of our...

37:50.890 --> 37:52.270
Brothers-In-Arms.

37:55.890 --> 37:57.860
You're not gonna get your
revenge, Emerson.

37:57.900 --> 37:58.810
Why is that?

37:58.860 --> 37:59.900
Because he's dead.

38:00.820 --> 38:03.150
Six years ago.
I guess you

38:03.190 --> 38:06.490
let your subscription to Black
Ops monthly run out.

38:07.990 --> 38:08.950
That's too bad.

38:10.330 --> 38:11.540
I guess that leaves only you.

38:11.580 --> 38:13.000
Pal. Pal. Look,

38:13.040 --> 38:14.330
I gotta say--

38:14.370 --> 38:15.460
You're taking this
thing a little too

38:15.500 --> 38:16.540
seriously,
don't you think?

38:16.580 --> 38:17.790
[Jake]
Excuse me.

38:17.830 --> 38:18.830
Uh, sir--

38:18.880 --> 38:19.540
No, no, no.
Don't--

38:20.210 --> 38:21.420
Just take it easy.

38:22.420 --> 38:23.590
Take it easy.
I'm not--

38:24.260 --> 38:25.550
I’m not armed.

38:26.180 --> 38:27.390
See? No gun.

38:28.300 --> 38:29.260
[Jimmy]
Doyle.

38:30.260 --> 38:31.720
You have a plan, right?

38:32.430 --> 38:33.520
Something like that.

38:37.440 --> 38:37.980
He only has one bullet
in the gun.

38:39.600 --> 38:40.860
If you came here to sacrifice
yourself for me, I'm touched.

38:42.190 --> 38:44.530
Yeah, Jimmy, you know.
You really are touched.

38:45.650 --> 38:47.860
Isn't he just a complete
and utter moron,

38:47.900 --> 38:49.490
Jimmy?
Right? Isn't he?

38:49.530 --> 38:50.450
Listen. Can I--

38:50.490 --> 38:51.370
say something?

38:52.370 --> 38:53.120
Shoot him.

38:53.540 --> 38:54.540
What?

38:54.580 --> 38:55.540
He's the one who left
you behind.

38:55.580 --> 38:56.500
No, no, no, no.

38:56.540 --> 38:57.910
No. No. You shoot Jake.

38:57.960 --> 38:59.580
He won't
stay out of your business.

38:59.630 --> 39:00.500
Ignore him.

39:01.750 --> 39:02.920
Seriously.

39:03.960 --> 39:05.670
And... Look at these.

39:06.670 --> 39:09.300
My allergy pen.
Just in case,

39:09.340 --> 39:10.760
Jake, you have
an anaphylactic

39:10.800 --> 39:12.010
shock moment.

39:12.050 --> 39:13.720
I still have bullets
in my pocket, you know.

39:13.760 --> 39:14.810
No, no, no. Don't shoot.

39:14.850 --> 39:16.770
I got a funny story
about Jimmy.

39:16.810 --> 39:18.020
You're gonna love this.

39:18.060 --> 39:19.850
You should really

39:19.890 --> 39:22.150
hear this story about
what an idiot Jimmy is.

39:22.190 --> 39:26.530
He had this stupid
allergic thing right?

39:26.570 --> 39:28.190
And I got Wolf---
Yeah, gimme that.

39:28.240 --> 39:31.120
He got Wolf to sexually
violate me with --

39:31.160 --> 39:32.120
This.

39:32.160 --> 39:33.490
Emerson! Look out.

39:36.240 --> 39:37.370
I can't feel my hand.

39:37.910 --> 39:38.830
[punch]

39:38.870 --> 39:39.790
Ha!

39:39.830 --> 39:40.670
Nice smack, old man.

39:41.170 --> 39:41.830
Nice work.

39:42.250 --> 39:43.340
Arrgh!

39:48.670 --> 39:50.050
I'm happy
Wolf is okay.

39:50.090 --> 39:50.840
Yeah, thanks. Thanks.

39:52.010 --> 39:55.260
I'm sorry about hitting
on you before.

39:56.310 --> 39:57.350
You're just so pretty.

39:58.810 --> 40:01.190
You know, that's all. I can't
help myself, you know.

40:01.230 --> 40:02.650
Jimmy, thanks.

40:02.690 --> 40:05.400
But, trust me. I am nowhere
near in the mood to flirt.

40:13.280 --> 40:14.820
I got a feeling with
all your talents,

40:14.870 --> 40:16.780
you won't be in
those cuffs for long.

40:16.830 --> 40:19.410
You know firsthand how I can
get myself out of them.

40:20.790 --> 40:24.830
Ahem.
Well, good luck.

40:24.880 --> 40:28.090
Don't get all sappy on me,
Jake. I did what I did. And--

40:29.130 --> 40:30.760
I have to pay for it.
It's fine.

40:30.800 --> 40:31.680
But--

40:33.430 --> 40:35.180
Let's not wait so long
between dates

40:35.220 --> 40:36.310
next time.

40:43.440 --> 40:45.650
I remember that being a little
more passionate.

40:46.980 --> 40:48.690
But maybe you have somebody
else on your mind?

41:02.160 --> 41:03.080
[Jimmy] To surviving

41:03.120 --> 41:04.000
a day with the Doyles.

41:04.040 --> 41:05.580
Despite being run over.

41:05.630 --> 41:08.050
You weren't actually run over.
You were just hit by a car door.

41:08.090 --> 41:09.380
To being shot--

41:09.420 --> 41:10.340
At.

41:10.380 --> 41:11.720
Shot at.

41:11.760 --> 41:12.970
To being stabbed in the arse.

41:13.880 --> 41:15.010
Okay. I'll give you that one.

41:15.050 --> 41:16.300
You were actually stabbed
in the arse.

41:18.760 --> 41:20.470
- Ahhh!
- Ooh! Dear.

41:21.270 --> 41:22.180
[Mal]
To Jimmy.

41:22.230 --> 41:22.850
Next round's on him.

41:22.890 --> 41:24.140
Let's go home.

41:24.190 --> 41:27.150
You know, we could afford
to take tomorrow off.

41:27.190 --> 41:29.690
Thanks to Jimmy and
his generous, albeit

41:29.730 --> 41:30.440
forced payment.

41:31.070 --> 41:32.150
You read my mind.

41:32.190 --> 41:33.360
By the way, who was it

41:33.400 --> 41:34.320
that you were meeting
with this afternoon?

41:35.410 --> 41:37.160
A potential client.
Didn't work out.

41:38.280 --> 41:40.740
Oh. Not like you to turn
down business.

41:41.790 --> 41:43.660
I think I left my purse
upstairs.

41:43.710 --> 41:47.290
I’ll get it.
Think sexy thoughts.

41:47.710 --> 41:48.960
Okay.

41:50.000 --> 41:51.170
So you lost Leslie,

41:51.210 --> 41:52.840
but you gained
a sixteen year old daughter.

41:53.260 --> 41:54.050
Sloan.

41:54.720 --> 41:54.930
Her name is Sloan.

41:56.260 --> 41:57.970
And she's lovely. I mean,
you'd really like her.

41:58.010 --> 41:59.260
She's a red head too.

41:59.300 --> 42:00.680
No way. Really?

42:00.720 --> 42:01.930
No.

42:01.970 --> 42:03.180
Thanks Jimmy b'y.

42:06.270 --> 42:08.270
Boss wants to see us.
Plane's on the tarmac.

42:08.310 --> 42:10.020
No rest for the wicked.

42:10.070 --> 42:10.570
Elvis.

42:11.820 --> 42:13.820
Hey. Despite it all,
good to see you, Jake.

42:14.820 --> 42:15.910
You too Jimmy.

42:31.130 --> 42:32.380
I guess you couldn't wait.

42:33.460 --> 42:34.470
[bang]
