in your nose? I don't think so.

11:11.062 --> 11:13.838
Quite frankly, Marge,
I'm hard of speaking.

11:13.840 --> 11:16.065
How can I believe
your interest in me

11:16.067 --> 11:17.992
is just professional?

11:17.994 --> 11:19.068
If I am lying, may I...

11:19.070 --> 11:21.905
never taste cheese again.

11:21.907 --> 11:24.165
Wow. Wow.

11:24.167 --> 11:25.517
See you tomorrow at 10:00.

11:25.519 --> 11:27.911
And what if you show up
and I'm not there?

11:27.913 --> 11:30.021
Then a good and decent man
who loves you

11:30.023 --> 11:32.081
will suffer horribly.

11:32.083 --> 11:33.358
I mean, of course, "Homair."

11:33.360 --> 11:35.026
You mean Homer?

11:35.028 --> 11:37.195
That's what I said-- "Homair."

11:37.197 --> 11:39.589
He needs you to win now,
more than "evair."

11:39.591 --> 11:42.592
And don't worry.
We will not have an affair.

11:42.594 --> 11:44.185
Because fair is fair.

11:44.187 --> 11:45.853
And I love your hair.

11:45.855 --> 11:47.430
And now I'm off
in my Corvair.

11:47.432 --> 11:51.358
Oh, I don't have a Corvair.
Horrible car.

11:51.360 --> 11:54.212
It was the only one I could
think of to rhyme. Stupid.

11:54.214 --> 11:56.030
Oh, you're still here.

11:56.032 --> 11:58.291
Great teacher.
Don't wait up.

11:58.293 --> 12:00.443

with the ball.

12:04.299 --> 12:07.425
What kind of bowling instructor
wears a turtleneck?

12:07.427 --> 12:09.619
I don't say
"mark my words" often,

12:09.621 --> 12:12.121
but mark my words.

12:12.123 --> 12:14.123
He's up to no good.

12:14.125 --> 12:16.217
Mark my words.

12:16.219 --> 12:19.462
What? You're crazy.
I'm getting six beers.

12:19.464 --> 12:21.722
So, should I start
my slide earlier?

12:21.724 --> 12:24.467
A better question is what
are you still doing with him?

12:24.469 --> 12:27.746
Clearly, he must have
changed his ways, huh?

12:27.748 --> 12:30.656
Improved?
Lost a pound or 20?

12:30.658 --> 12:34.586
Yes, he has, in too many ways
to mention, so I won't.

12:34.588 --> 12:36.996
So, then he's not still
buying you bowling balls

12:36.998 --> 12:39.073
for presents, is he?

12:39.075 --> 12:41.408
He apologized for that.

12:41.410 --> 12:43.595
Do you ever think of the night
you almost came to me?

12:43.597 --> 12:47.581
I had showered four times,
I shaved my face twice,

12:47.583 --> 12:49.250
I shaved my back once.

12:49.252 --> 12:50.994
I was ready for you, Marge.

12:50.996 --> 12:53.772
Later on in the evening
when the doorbell rang,

12:53.774 --> 12:56.441
I closed my eyes, I opened
the door, and I kissed.

12:56.443 --> 13:00.003
Unfortunately, I forgot
I had ordered DoorDash.

13:00.005 --> 13:04.173
It was some 20-year-old kid
holding a roast beef sandwich.

13:04.175 --> 13:07.010
Apparently, he came out
the next day.

13:07.012 --> 13:08.745
You said just bowling.

13:10.123 --> 13:13.182
I am the only one who can
help you with this match.

a Frenchman wants

it is to beat Americans

at the game they love.

And then, of course, a 12-course
meal, with a fine wine

and maybe a snail,

13:24.696 --> 13:27.955

to pick up the check.
