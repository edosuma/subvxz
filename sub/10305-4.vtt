00:20.280 --> 00:21.315
Any mail for me?

00:21.520 --> 00:25.035
<i>Oh, come on, Bud.
You know Newsgeek comes tomorrow.</i>

00:25.240 --> 00:26.719
Then what's behind your back?

00:27.520 --> 00:29.112
Couch.

00:30.880 --> 00:34.350
- Did we get a cereal sample?
- No.

00:34.560 --> 00:37.552
- Then why do I smell riboflavin?
- Oh, come on, Bud, it's mine.

00:37.760 --> 00:41.912
- You got the last sample.
- That was a bottle of Midol.

00:42.120 --> 00:44.634
- Well, you look a lot less bloated.
- Just give me that.

00:44.840 --> 00:46.034
Oh, look what you did.

00:52.040 --> 00:54.235
Kids, we have an emergency.

00:54.440 --> 00:56.351
An emergency? What is it?

00:56.560 --> 00:59.233
An unforeseen circumstance
that calls for immediate action.

00:59.440 --> 01:00.839
That's not the point right now.

01:01.040 --> 01:04.396
Come on!
The love of my life's in trouble.

01:04.599 --> 01:06.636
Oh, my God.
Something's wrong with Mom.

01:06.840 --> 01:10.196
No, you idiot. It's the Dodge. Hurry.

01:48.720 --> 01:51.871
Bud, eight quarts of antifreeze, stat.

01:54.480 --> 01:56.914
Kelly, less suction.

01:57.920 --> 02:00.115
Bet you haven't heard that
in a while.

02:03.520 --> 02:06.114
I'm gonna hook up the scope.

02:08.479 --> 02:11.358
Oh, damn. The pressure's low.

02:11.560 --> 02:14.279
Bud, 3-quarter-inch socket wrench.

02:14.760 --> 02:18.309
I said 3-quarter.
Stay with me here or get out of my way.

02:19.400 --> 02:22.392
Kelly, try to start the car.

02:24.640 --> 02:26.392
Bud, cables.

02:29.760 --> 02:30.875
Clear.

02:34.080 --> 02:35.593
Nothing, Dad.

02:35.800 --> 02:38.633
Again! Clear!

02:43.040 --> 02:45.235
- Damn!
- Nothing.

02:45.440 --> 02:48.512
- Maybe we should call it, Dad.
- Bud we can't. I'm gonna open her up.

02:48.720 --> 02:50.597
Open-gasket massage?

02:50.800 --> 02:54.952
- It's a risk, but we have no choice.
- But, Dad, you've never done it before.

02:55.160 --> 02:58.596
I know, I know.
But I observed it once at Pep Boys.

03:25.640 --> 03:30.430
- All right. She's holding her own.
- Just like you, Bud.

03:32.400 --> 03:35.153
But we need to get a specialist
over here. Bud, call Detroit.

03:35.360 --> 03:36.759
It's gonna cost a ton of money.

03:36.960 --> 03:39.474
Well, then we'll have to dip
into the college fund.

03:39.680 --> 03:42.035
Oh, we had a college fund?

03:42.480 --> 03:44.471
I just graduated.

03:44.680 --> 03:47.638
Well, then you won't be needing any,
will you?

03:53.680 --> 03:55.716
There, there.

03:56.480 --> 03:57.959
You'll be okay.

03:59.080 --> 04:02.152
That's it. That's it. You cough it up.

04:14.080 --> 04:16.389
I'll just empty this out.

04:17.200 --> 04:21.273
<i>Hey, you want to watch some TV?
They're showing monster trucks.</i>

04:21.959 --> 04:24.758
Hi, Al. How's she doing?

04:24.960 --> 04:29.238
She's idling on life support, Peg.
She's in a coma.

04:30.640 --> 04:36.510
Al, you need to get some rest,
or help of some kind.

04:36.960 --> 04:40.316
Peg, you don't understand the bond
between a guy and his car.

04:40.520 --> 04:41.635
It's sacred.

04:41.840 --> 04:44.718
Well, you mean kind of like the bond
between a husband and wife?

04:44.920 --> 04:47.718
Don't trivialize it, Peg.

04:48.560 --> 04:51.791
This was my first car.
This is part of my youth.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.675
Yeah, and like your youth,
it should be long gone.

04:55.920 --> 04:59.754
All right, Peg. Let me put this
into words that you'll understand.

04:59.960 --> 05:02.076
You remember your first couch?

05:05.320 --> 05:07.436
I still miss it.

05:08.360 --> 05:10.396
Well, that's how I feel about this car.

05:10.600 --> 05:14.593
Me and my dad had our best days
working on it.

05:16.600 --> 05:19.433
I can't believe
you bought this piece of junk.

05:19.640 --> 05:21.710
Hand me that screwdriver.

05:25.160 --> 05:27.196
Not this one.

05:28.360 --> 05:30.476
The one with ice in it.

05:35.240 --> 05:37.117
How are you gonna pay
for this scrapheap?

05:37.320 --> 05:41.552
I got a job down
at that ladies' shoe store.

05:42.200 --> 05:46.432
You're gonna sell ladies' shoes?
What are you, a fruit?

05:47.160 --> 05:49.833
Oh, Dad, it's just for the summer.

05:51.760 --> 05:53.990
Hey, is the car gonna be ready
tonight?

05:54.200 --> 05:56.794
Well, it will if you shut up
and hand me that screwdriver.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.275
Which one, Dad?

06:03.880 --> 06:06.110
Which one do you think?

06:07.160 --> 06:09.515
I can't fix a car with a drink.

06:10.240 --> 06:11.992
Well, anyway, that's good...

06:12.200 --> 06:16.557
...because I'm taking my date to the
Rolling Stones farewell concert tonight.

06:17.440 --> 06:20.318
Long-haired limey fruits.

06:20.840 --> 06:26.392
Yeah, but she wants to go and
she's the grooviest chick in school.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.756
Peggy Wanker.

06:30.720 --> 06:33.712
Be careful, son.
Don't let her get her hooks into you.

06:33.920 --> 06:35.478
Don't worry about me, Dad.

06:35.680 --> 06:37.796
Peggy would never stand
in the way of my dream.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.197
She worships the ground
that I walk on.

06:42.320 --> 06:45.835
The best part is
she really listens to me.

06:50.920 --> 06:53.912
Are you listening to me, Peg? Peg?

06:54.120 --> 06:57.829
Oh, yeah. Oh, great story, Al.

06:58.800 --> 07:00.950
- Mr. Bundy?
- Yes?

07:01.160 --> 07:02.798
I'm Dr. Fisher, the specialist.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.673
Oh, thank God you're here, doctor.

07:05.920 --> 07:07.876
- Doctor?
- Yes, ma'am.

07:08.080 --> 07:11.436
Doctor of automotive engineering,
Quaker State.

07:14.200 --> 07:15.519
I'll need to see her chart.

07:15.720 --> 07:20.316
Oh, yeah. See, here.
Her air-to-fuel ratio is 180 over 90.

07:21.360 --> 07:25.876
- That's a little high.
- Is she going to be all right, doctor?

07:26.080 --> 07:28.640
Yes, I'm sure she'll be fine.

07:33.440 --> 07:35.271
Oh, dear God.

07:35.480 --> 07:38.995
- What? What?
- It's exactly what I feared, Mr. Bundy.

07:39.200 --> 07:40.155
The fuel pump.

07:42.360 --> 07:43.315
What have you fed her?

07:43.520 --> 07:46.080
She has the hoses of a car
with twice her mileage.

07:46.280 --> 07:50.114
Well, I didn't always buy her
the best gas when she was young.

07:50.360 --> 07:51.634
Don't blame yourself.

07:51.840 --> 07:55.389
If we only knew then
what we know now about octane.

07:58.320 --> 08:02.108
Oh, well. Look, the bottom line
is you need a transplant.

08:02.320 --> 08:03.753
A whole new pump.

08:03.960 --> 08:06.030
That's not all he needs.

08:07.320 --> 08:11.233
Now, unfortunately, finding a donor
pump will be nearly impossible.

08:11.440 --> 08:15.797
Oh, yeah? If it was Larry Hagman's car,
you'd find a donor pump.

08:16.480 --> 08:19.517
You should realise that these parts
are worth a lot of money.

08:21.480 --> 08:22.515
Be reasonable, Al.

08:22.720 --> 08:25.393
There are lots of other Dodges
out there suffering.

08:25.600 --> 08:28.319
Mr. Bundy, I know this is difficult...

08:28.520 --> 08:32.433
...but we should harvest these parts
now while they're still lubricated.

08:32.640 --> 08:34.357
Are you nuts?

08:34.960 --> 08:40.080
You're not a doctor, you're a butcher.
Get out of here, you Jiffy Lube reject.

08:40.280 --> 08:44.512
Yeah. Get out of here, you oink.

08:45.440 --> 08:48.352
- Quack.
- Moo!

08:49.200 --> 08:51.031
Woof! This is fun. Meow!

08:51.240 --> 08:53.390
Kids, kids, kids.

08:53.600 --> 08:57.354
Now, Daddy needs a part for his car
and you're gonna help him get it.

08:57.560 --> 08:58.834
Now, are you with me?

08:59.040 --> 09:01.315
- Oh, I'm so tired.
- How long have you known us?

09:01.520 --> 09:04.717
I'll take that for a yes,
but don't fake it, because I can tell.

09:05.280 --> 09:07.350
Sure you can, Al.

09:09.160 --> 09:11.674
Don't you worry, sweetheart.

09:12.080 --> 09:15.311
Whatever's wrong with you,
Daddy's gonna fix.

09:20.840 --> 09:24.116
She can't keep anything down, Peg.

09:26.640 --> 09:30.428
Son, did you find my fuel pump yet?

09:30.640 --> 09:34.110
No. I've surfed the Internet all night.
I still can't find anything.

09:34.320 --> 09:38.154
What are you doing with a picture of
Pamela Lee naked on a Slip 'n Slide?

09:41.120 --> 09:43.111
Nothing, yet.

09:45.960 --> 09:47.518
Keep working.

09:54.520 --> 09:56.909
Well, Al,
according to these magazines...

09:57.120 --> 10:01.989
...all the cars like yours have
either been recalled or exploded.

10:03.280 --> 10:06.158
Oh, but don't worry.
Kelly's combing the classifieds.

10:10.360 --> 10:11.918
No luck, yet, Daddy.

10:15.520 --> 10:18.114
You know, family,
I've gotta tell you...

10:18.320 --> 10:22.074
...I'm really touched by the fact that
you stayed with me through this crisis.

10:22.280 --> 10:24.919
I mean, we've pulled together,
and gosh darn it...

10:25.120 --> 10:29.079
...I just got to say,
you're like family to me.

10:29.280 --> 10:32.829
- Oh, Al-
- Don't touch me, though.

10:34.240 --> 10:36.310
Hey, do I smell gas?

10:36.520 --> 10:38.590
- It was the dog.
- It was the dog.

10:41.800 --> 10:44.234
No, I meant the car.

10:44.880 --> 10:46.359
Her hoses must be haemorrhaging.

10:48.920 --> 10:50.353
He's gone.

10:52.800 --> 10:55.837
Okay.
What are your bids on the carburettor?

10:56.040 --> 10:59.112
Okay. A Dodge collector in Toledo
will offer us 200.

10:59.320 --> 11:03.598
<i>Oh, wait a second, wait a second.
Vancouver will offer us 250.</i>

11:03.800 --> 11:06.189
I don't think so.
Hold on one second, please.

11:06.400 --> 11:10.916
This idiot in Zurich offered to buy
the pistons for 1000 francs.

11:11.120 --> 11:15.671
As if. I mean,
where would we get the buns? Hello?

11:24.040 --> 11:27.077
Will he throw in some baked beans,
Kel?

11:27.840 --> 11:30.832
Good thinking. I'll check.
We want beans...

11:31.040 --> 11:35.716
Oh, Bud, when your father and I die,
you'll watch after her, won't you?

11:37.480 --> 11:40.631
Mom, I'll have my own wife and kids
to think about then.

11:40.840 --> 11:43.274
Oh, yeah.

11:46.960 --> 11:49.235
Hey, Dad's coming!

11:53.680 --> 11:56.990
Well, I've got her stabilized,
but she's lost a lot of fuel.

11:57.200 --> 12:00.909
Oh, God, I don't know
what I'm gonna do without her.

12:01.120 --> 12:03.395
Get to places on time?

12:03.600 --> 12:06.160
Oh, Peg, how can you say
a thing like that?

12:06.360 --> 12:10.399
Don't you remember the good times
we had in that car?

12:17.640 --> 12:22.236
Oh, Al. That was incredible.

12:22.440 --> 12:24.749
Peggy, you drive me wild.

12:24.960 --> 12:28.509
- I could go all night long.
- Oh, Al.

12:28.720 --> 12:32.759
You're better than
the whole football team combined.

12:33.280 --> 12:35.714
Not that I'd know.

12:36.480 --> 12:41.508
- Hey. Chocolates?
- Oh, no. I hate candy.

12:42.360 --> 12:44.749
You know, Al,
you were really amazing tonight.

12:44.960 --> 12:47.633
I mean, four touchdowns
in a single game.

12:47.840 --> 12:50.877
Oh, babe, that's no big deal.

12:51.080 --> 12:55.039
I mean, it's not like it's gonna be
the highlight of my life or anything.

12:58.280 --> 13:02.478
Oh, I know, honey.
Sky's the limit for you, and me too.

13:02.680 --> 13:06.514
Well, you know, today, while
I was napping in my Home Ec class...

13:06.720 --> 13:10.474
...I had the greatest idea for
a way people could shop at home...

13:10.720 --> 13:12.950
...using the television.

13:13.680 --> 13:20.199
Oh, babe. That's an even sillier idea
than your phone-without-a-cord thing.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.152
Peg, don't you worry.

13:22.360 --> 13:25.636
A girl as pretty as you are
will never have to work.

13:25.840 --> 13:30.755
Oh, Al, you are so far out.

13:30.960 --> 13:33.872
And you are foxy.

13:34.160 --> 13:36.071
- Again?
- Hey.

13:36.280 --> 13:40.114
- Four is my new lucky number, baby.
- Oh, right.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.959
And my backfield's in motion.

13:47.040 --> 13:51.192
Obviously, you don't remember
what else happened that night.

13:51.400 --> 13:52.913
No.

13:54.040 --> 13:55.678
- Oh, Al.
- Oh, Peg.

13:55.880 --> 13:58.075
Oh, Al.

13:58.640 --> 14:01.757
- What?
- I think it broke.

14:03.200 --> 14:05.555
Oh, my God.
How could that have happened?

14:05.760 --> 14:07.557
I don't know.

14:07.760 --> 14:10.194
It worked before.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.798
You used the same one?

14:14.000 --> 14:16.594
Hey, they're expensive.

14:17.120 --> 14:18.917
Al, this is terrible.

14:19.120 --> 14:23.352
You're telling me.
Now I'm gonna have to buy a new one.

14:29.240 --> 14:32.596
You know, Peg, my dad was right.
You really did get your hooks into me.

14:32.800 --> 14:34.836
Oh, right, Al.

14:35.040 --> 14:39.192
I trapped you
so I could have all this.

14:40.440 --> 14:43.193
Oh, wait a minute, now.

14:53.520 --> 14:55.590
Hey, I'm sorry to hear about the car.

14:55.800 --> 15:00.191
All the guys chipped in
and we got you this.

15:01.480 --> 15:05.758
Hey, an air freshener.
I'll hang it on her rear-view mirror.

15:05.960 --> 15:08.679
Well, actually, you should hang it
around your neck.

15:09.200 --> 15:11.555
We got this for the car.

15:11.960 --> 15:13.598
I'm sure she'll love them.

15:13.800 --> 15:17.918
Look, Al, God forbid,
she doesn't make it...

15:18.120 --> 15:20.554
...the important thing is
you get back on the horse.

15:20.760 --> 15:21.954
Well, thanks, Jefferson...

15:22.160 --> 15:24.958
...but how's sex with my wife
gonna make me feel any better?

15:27.040 --> 15:31.716
You know, Al. I mean,
you should go out and buy a new car.

15:31.920 --> 15:34.992
I don't need a new car, because
I'm gonna find the part to this one.

15:35.200 --> 15:38.590
There's a rumour that
the fuel pump you need is in Cuba.

15:38.800 --> 15:40.358
Good luck getting it out of there.

15:40.560 --> 15:45.190
Damn Castro. Damn Khrushchev.
Damn Steve Allen.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.753
Dad,
what's Steve Allen got to do with it?

15:49.960 --> 15:52.599
Nothing. I just hate him.

15:54.800 --> 15:58.270
Oh, Cuba.

15:58.480 --> 16:01.472
Sultry, seductive Cuba.

16:01.680 --> 16:05.468
Where the jungles are friendly
and the women are easy to hide in.

16:07.600 --> 16:11.149
- Or was it the other way around?
- Listen, thanks, buddy, for stopping by.

16:11.360 --> 16:13.078
I don't know how I can repay you.

16:13.280 --> 16:16.317
Just keep wearing the air freshener.
Thanks.

16:18.200 --> 16:21.795
Dad, give it up.
The car's a lost cause.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.390
So's my family,
but you don't see me giving up on you.

16:26.040 --> 16:29.874
That Dodge is
part of the Bundy family history.

16:32.280 --> 16:37.149
Oh, Bud, my little man.
The boy I always wanted, Peg.

16:37.360 --> 16:39.635
Now, Al, you're gonna hurt
little Kelly's feelings.

16:40.440 --> 16:44.149
You know, Phil Donahue says
that if a father ignores his daughter...

16:44.360 --> 16:48.672
...she could develop
an abnormal craving for male attention.

16:50.480 --> 16:53.711
Phil Donahue is full of crap.

16:55.080 --> 16:59.039
Mommy, Daddy,
Bud's touching himself.

17:01.800 --> 17:03.677
Oh, don't worry about that, Kelly.

17:03.880 --> 17:06.916
That's just a phase he's going through.
He'll grow out of it.

17:07.119 --> 17:11.875
Why don't you give him one of your
rubber dollies to play with instead?

17:13.599 --> 17:15.909
Yeah, I don't know if
that's such a good idea, Peg.

17:16.280 --> 17:17.952
Oh, come on, Al.

17:18.160 --> 17:22.438
You and your gender stereotypes.
What difference does it make?

17:22.640 --> 17:24.471
You're right.

17:26.839 --> 17:28.831
Mommy, Daddy, did you know...

17:29.040 --> 17:34.592
...the possums are the only indigenous
marsupial to North America?

17:37.000 --> 17:39.434
Gee, that's great, sweetheart.

17:40.480 --> 17:43.233
What the hell did she just say?

17:43.840 --> 17:45.319
I don't know.

17:45.520 --> 17:47.636
You know,
I'm kind of worried about her, Al.

17:47.840 --> 17:51.469
You ever notice how she's always
got her head buried in a book?

17:52.160 --> 17:55.550
Yeah, she's not like us, is she, Peg?

17:55.760 --> 17:57.637
Of course, on the bright side,
you know...

17:57.840 --> 17:59.956
...she'll grow up and go to college...

18:00.160 --> 18:04.153
...get a great job
and support us in our old age.

18:05.280 --> 18:06.349
Al, look out.

18:08.200 --> 18:11.033
Damn Japanese cars.

18:11.440 --> 18:16.195
So small, you can't even see them.
They'll never catch on.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.036
Kelly, are you all right?

18:27.920 --> 18:32.232
Look! Shiny, shiny shoes.

18:39.120 --> 18:43.113
You see? That car's been with us
in good times and bad times.

18:43.320 --> 18:45.754
And when are we getting
to the good times?

18:45.960 --> 18:48.520
When you're on life support.

18:52.120 --> 18:53.473
She needs her brake fluid.

18:57.040 --> 18:59.110
Okay. Unbelievable.

18:59.320 --> 19:02.835
A collector in Düsseldorf will give us
five grand for the entire engine.

19:03.040 --> 19:05.600
Forget it. Dad will never take the car
off life support.

19:05.800 --> 19:08.951
Yeah, we'll see about that.
Tell Gunther he's got a deal.

19:18.440 --> 19:19.509
She's still running hot.

19:21.520 --> 19:24.273
Well, this will cool you down now.

19:25.720 --> 19:30.077
Al. Honey,
this is no kind of life for her.

19:30.280 --> 19:31.872
Let her die with dignity.

19:32.080 --> 19:33.718
Peg, that is not up to us.

19:33.920 --> 19:38.118
That is up to the man upstairs
and maybe Lee lacocca.

19:38.360 --> 19:40.271
Now, look, Al.
I am going to say this...

19:40.480 --> 19:43.950
...in the most supportive
and loving way that I possibly can.

19:44.160 --> 19:46.720
You are insane
and I am killing this car.

19:46.920 --> 19:49.992
Never. Never.

19:54.920 --> 19:57.718
No, don't leave me alone.

19:58.480 --> 20:02.393
I hope you're happy, Peg. She's gone.
Her oil is on your hands.

20:02.600 --> 20:04.556
Her oil is all over town.

20:05.480 --> 20:10.793
Oh, why couldn't it have been me
or you?

20:11.000 --> 20:13.230
Oh, honey, let it go.

20:13.440 --> 20:16.557
Yeah, Dad. You did all you could.

20:17.000 --> 20:20.037
Hey, I know we're supposed to be sad,
but I can't cry.

20:20.240 --> 20:21.992
What should I do?

20:22.280 --> 20:24.350
Just pull a nose hair.

20:27.240 --> 20:28.992
Well, you said to pull a nose hair.

20:30.160 --> 20:34.756
Oh, no, son. No, no, no.

20:37.480 --> 20:40.233
She's in a better place now, son.

20:40.440 --> 20:41.998
What, a German chop shop?

20:42.200 --> 20:47.115
No. Daddy's Dodge is in
that big parking structure in the sky.

20:47.320 --> 20:51.791
Where the gas flows free
and the traffic lights are always green.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.116
I'm sorry, Dad.

20:54.440 --> 20:57.989
- Yeah. We love you, Daddy.
- That's all right, kid.

20:58.200 --> 20:59.713
Just give me a moment.

20:59.920 --> 21:03.913
All right, Al. But, you know,
we're here if you need us.

21:19.760 --> 21:22.558
Drive towards the light, old friend.

21:23.920 --> 21:25.433
Drive towards the light.
