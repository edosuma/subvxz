BEAST WARS!

[growl]

01:20.779 --> 01:25.947
- OH, IS MY INSIDE AS GORGEOUS AS MY OUTSIDE?

01:28.147 --> 01:30.848
- HEH, DON'T FLATTER YOURSELF, EIGHT-LEGS.

01:30.948 --> 01:34.648
I SEEN BETTER CIRCUITS THAN YOURS ON MAINTENANCE BOTS.

01:34.748 --> 01:36.482
HEH! - ONE MORE REMARK LIKE THAT

01:36.582 --> 01:41.182
AND IT'LL BE RAT ON A STICK FOR LUNCH.

01:41.282 --> 01:44.449
- NOW THOSE ARE WHAT I CALL LINES.

01:44.549 --> 01:46.017
- UGH. SOMEONE GET HIM A KITTY TREAT

01:46.117 --> 01:49.183
BEFORE HE DROOLS ALL OVER YOUR COMPUTER.

01:49.283 --> 01:51.051
- KNOCK IT OFF, ALL OF YOU.

01:51.151 --> 01:54.485
I'M ALMOST FINISHED.

01:54.585 --> 01:56.752
THERE.

01:56.852 --> 02:00.285
THAT'S THE SHELL PROGRAM.

02:00.386 --> 02:02.486
- OH, SO THAT'S WHAT'S KEEPING SPIDER-BRAIN

02:02.586 --> 02:08.287
FROM FINDING HER TRUE MAXIMAL SELF, HUH?.

02:08.387 --> 02:10.221
- VERY COMPLEX.

02:10.321 --> 02:13.454
HM, DEFINITELY ME.

02:13.554 --> 02:14.888
- WE'RE FINISHED HERE.

02:14.988 --> 02:16.522
YOU CAN GO.

02:16.622 --> 02:19.088
THANKS.

02:19.188 --> 02:20.622

02:20.722 --> 02:22.156
DON'T YOU TRUST ME?

02:22.256 --> 02:24.857
- HEH, ABOUT AS FAR AS AN ANVIL CAN JUMP.

02:24.957 --> 02:26.623
[sputters]

02:26.723 --> 02:29.657
OF COURSE I MEAN THAT IN THE BEST POSSIBLE WAY.

02:29.758 --> 02:32.225
- BLACKARACHNIA, HE WAS ONLY...

02:32.324 --> 02:34.592
[gulp] KIDDING.

02:34.691 --> 02:35.625
- BACK OFF.

02:35.725 --> 02:37.859
I'M TIRED OF TESTS AND SECRETS

02:37.959 --> 02:40.326
AND HANGING AROUND THIS DEPRESSING DUMP.

02:40.426 --> 02:45.160
AND I'M SICK OF YOUR STUPID CRUSH.

02:45.260 --> 02:48.460
- BLACKARACHNIA, STAND DOWN!

02:48.560 --> 02:51.161
- [grunts] EH.

02:51.261 --> 02:55.094
- I THOUGHT I'D PROVED MYSELF TO YOU MAXIMALS BY NOW.

02:55.194 --> 02:59.895
GUESS I WAS WRONG.

02:59.995 --> 03:03.130
- RATTRAP, CALL SILVERBOLT IN FROM PATROL.

03:03.230 --> 03:04.963
CHEETOR, YOU REPLACE HIM.

03:05.063 --> 03:09.663

03:11.297 --> 03:12.898
WHO NEEDS 'EM?

03:12.998 --> 03:15.965
- NOT ME.

03:21.166 --> 03:22.166
- CAN YOU REMOVE THE SHELL

03:22.266 --> 03:25.099
AND REACTIVATE HER MAXIMAL PROGRAMMING?

03:25.199 --> 03:26.666
- MM, IT'S TRICKY.

03:26.767 --> 03:28.334
AND DANGEROUS.

03:28.434 --> 03:31.768
IT COULD DUMP HER ENTIRE CORE AND LEAVE HER A BLANK.

03:31.868 --> 03:33.235
- AND IF WE DO NOTHING?

03:33.335 --> 03:39.136
- SHE'LL BE A PREDACON FOREVER.

03:39.236 --> 03:42.136
- HM. THAT MAY BE TOO BIG A CHANCE TO TAKE RIGHT NOW.

03:42.236 --> 03:46.404

05:06.417 --> 05:08.884

05:08.984 --> 05:12.317
SILVERBOLT IS EVERY BAD GIRL'S DREAM.

05:12.418 --> 05:14.885
BUT HIS MAXIMAL PALS WOULD RATHER SLAG ME

05:14.985 --> 05:18.318
THAN LET ME BE WHAT I AM.

05:18.419 --> 05:21.419
SO, I GUESS THIS GIG'S OVER.

UNH.

SO MUCH FOR BORING.

07:21.073 --> 07:25.139

07:25.239 --> 07:30.007
NOW GO BACK TO YOUR WEB, COWARD.

07:30.107 --> 07:34.341
- OH, CALLING ME A COWARD IS ONE THING.

07:34.441 --> 07:39.375
BUT NOBODY CALLS ME A MAXIMAL!

07:39.475 --> 07:40.775

07:40.875 --> 07:44.910
FIGHT!

07:46.377 --> 07:50.444
OOH. OOH, YEAH.

07:50.544 --> 07:53.811
- I CANNOT FIND BLACKARACHNIA ANYWHERE.

07:58.012 --> 07:59.112
- HEY! WHAT THE--

07:59.212 --> 08:01.712
HAVE YOU SLIPPED YOUR CIRCUITS THERE, BOLT?

08:01.813 --> 08:04.779
OH, MAN, I ALMOST CLEARED THE LEVEL.

08:04.879 --> 08:09.547
- COMPUTER, SCAN PERIMETER FOR UNIT BLACKARACHNIA.

08:09.647 --> 08:11.514

08:11.613 --> 08:14.047

I'LL TELL OPTIMUS--

09:18.791 --> 09:21.959
BLACKARACHNIA CROSSES INTO THE JAMMING ZONE?

09:22.059 --> 09:25.259

09:27.493 --> 09:29.793
- MM. [laughs]

09:29.893 --> 09:33.928
NOW WE PLAY...FOR REAL.

09:46.563 --> 09:49.030
- MOOD. SETTING.

11:37.582 --> 11:39.849
- OW, OH, OH.

11:39.949 --> 11:42.483
- THE MAXIMALS HAVE MADE YOU SOFT.

11:42.583 --> 11:46.850
MEGATRON WILL CHANGE THAT... - [grunting]

11:46.950 --> 11:51.550
- AFTER HE EXTRACTS THE ACCESS CODES FOR THE ARK

11:51.650 --> 11:54.351
FROM YOUR HEAD.

11:54.451 --> 11:56.284
NOW, HOLD STILL.

11:56.384 --> 11:59.785
THIS WILL HURT.

11:59.885 --> 12:02.352
- AH!

12:02.452 --> 12:04.953

12:21.489 --> 12:24.256
BLACKARACHNIA TO SILVERBOLT.

12:31.990 --> 12:33.724
I'M BADLY DAMAGED.

12:33.824 --> 12:35.691
I NEED A LIFT.

12:39.825 --> 12:41.391
SILVERBOLT, DO YOU COPY?

12:41.492 --> 12:44.626
- [growls]

12:44.726 --> 12:48.160
- GREAT, I LET THAT SNEAKY LIZARD LEAD ME

12:48.260 --> 12:50.960
RIGHT INTO MEGATRON'S JAMMING ZONE.

12:51.060 --> 12:55.528
- YOUR FIRST MISTAKE, BUT NOT YOUR LAST.

13:07.762 --> 13:12.597
YOUR TIME IS DONE, SPIDER.

13:18.564 --> 13:22.565
- OH, MY TRACKING ARRAY IS USELESS IN THE JAMMING ZONE.

13:22.665 --> 13:25.799
I MUST RETURN TO BASICS.

13:33.934 --> 13:35.667
[sniffs]

13:35.767 --> 13:37.767
I HAVE HER SCENT!

13:37.868 --> 13:39.635
AND ANOTHER ONE.

13:39.735 --> 13:43.202
A FOUL ONE. [sniffs]

13:43.302 --> 13:46.135

13:59.571 --> 14:02.305

14:02.405 --> 14:07.406
- I, UH, THOUGHT THEY WERE IN THE LAB, HEH, WITH YOU.

14:07.507 --> 14:09.640
- THERE'S NO SIGN OF THEM ON THE SCANNERS,

14:09.740 --> 14:11.907
INTERNAL OR EXTERNAL.

14:12.007 --> 14:15.241
- OPTIMUS TO SILVERBOLT, COME IN IMMEDIATELY, THAT'S AN ORDER!

14:15.341 --> 14:16.474
[static]

14:16.574 --> 14:19.375
- THEY MUST BE IN MEGATRON'S JAMMING ZONE.

14:19.475 --> 14:22.642
- LOCATE THEM, AND LET ME KNOW AS SOON AS YOU DO.

14:32.877 --> 14:36.378
- I DON'T KNOW HOW FANG SURVIVED MY VENOM,

14:36.477 --> 14:39.411
BUT A TRIPLE DOSE SHOULD DROP HIM.

14:39.512 --> 14:44.846
- THANK PRIMUS I FOUND YOU!

OF YOUR TWISTED AFFECTION.

15:21.352 --> 15:27.219

- [growls]

15:43.955 --> 15:46.256
- [grunts]

15:56.758 --> 15:58.992
- YOU SURPRISE ME.

15:59.092 --> 16:03.225
PERHAPS THERE IS SOME PREDACON LEFT IN YOU AFTER ALL.

16:03.325 --> 16:06.293
- I'M THROUGH WITH THE MAXIMALS.

16:06.393 --> 16:08.926
BUT I CAN'T GO BACK TO MEGATRON, EITHER.

16:09.026 --> 16:11.527
NOT WITHOUT SOMEONE TO BACK ME UP.

16:11.627 --> 16:13.461
SOMEONE LIKE YOU.

16:13.561 --> 16:16.995
- MM, INTERESTING.

16:17.095 --> 16:19.728
TELL ME MORE.

16:19.828 --> 16:23.096
- [groans]

16:23.195 --> 16:25.429
- YOU'RE STATE-OF-THE-ART METAL,

16:25.530 --> 16:27.863
AND I'VE GOT THE KEY TO THE ARK.

16:27.963 --> 16:31.430
TOGETHER, WE COULD RULE...

16:31.531 --> 16:34.130
WITHOUT MEGATRON.

16:34.230 --> 16:35.464
- AH.

16:35.564 --> 16:39.064
WHAT...HAPPENED?

16:39.164 --> 16:43.266
- USURP MEGATRON'S COMMAND AND TAKE THE ARK FOR OURSELVES?

16:43.366 --> 16:46.332
IT IS AMBITIOUS.

16:46.432 --> 16:48.633
- I'M THAT KIND OF A GIRL.

16:48.733 --> 16:52.167
SO, WHAT DO YOU SAY? PARTNERS?

16:52.267 --> 16:55.634
- I SAY, YOU...

16:55.734 --> 16:57.668

17:02.235 --> 17:04.002
[strained grunts]

17:04.102 --> 17:05.836
- BELOVED!

17:05.936 --> 17:07.836
- [grunts]

17:07.936 --> 17:10.737
- YOU'LL BE ABLE TO MOVE IN A MOMENT.

17:10.837 --> 17:12.570
- [grunting]

17:12.670 --> 17:13.737
- JUST ENOUGH TO FEEL

17:13.837 --> 17:16.538
THE FINAL BLOW.

17:16.638 --> 17:18.138
- UNHAND HER,

17:18.238 --> 17:21.839
REPTILIAN FILTH!

17:21.938 --> 17:25.006
- [roars]

17:34.507 --> 17:37.108
[screams]

17:37.208 --> 17:40.141
- [sighs]

17:40.241 --> 17:44.376
- [growls]

17:44.476 --> 17:46.609
[roars]

17:46.709 --> 17:49.343
- GAME OVER, FANGS.

17:49.443 --> 17:52.143
- [grunts]

17:52.243 --> 17:56.611
NOOO!

17:56.710 --> 17:58.378
[crash]

17:58.478 --> 18:02.012
- AH, OH.

18:02.112 --> 18:03.746
TOOK YOU LONG ENOUGH.

18:03.846 --> 18:05.412
- STOP!

18:05.512 --> 18:06.679
- WHAT IS IT?

18:06.779 --> 18:09.680
- DESPITE YOUR ATTEMPT TO DESTROY ME, I--

18:09.780 --> 18:12.580
I HEARD YOUR FOUL PLAN TO BETRAY US.

18:12.680 --> 18:17.081
- OH, WHY ARE THE CUTE ONES ALWAYS TUBE HEADS?

18:17.181 --> 18:18.714
THAT WAS A DIVERSION.

18:18.814 --> 18:22.148
I WANTED TO GET DINOBOT AWAY FROM YOU.

18:22.248 --> 18:23.949
- YOU SHOT ME!

18:24.049 --> 18:27.483
- IF I DIDN'T, HE WOULD HAVE BLOWN YOUR HEAD OFF.

18:27.583 --> 18:29.449
AND YOU'RE STILL FUNCTIONAL, AREN'T YOU?

18:29.550 --> 18:31.850
- IT SEEMS SO, YES.

18:31.950 --> 18:32.850
BUT--

18:32.950 --> 18:34.250
- OH. OH, I GET IT.

18:34.350 --> 18:36.350
YOU DON'T TRUST ME EITHER!

18:36.450 --> 18:37.851
- BLACKARACHNIA--

18:37.951 --> 18:39.185
- BACK OFF, BOWSER.

18:39.285 --> 18:42.418
I'VE TRIED MY BEST TO FIT IN WITH YOU MAXIMALS,

18:42.518 --> 18:44.152
BUT IT'S JUST NOT WORKING.

18:44.252 --> 18:45.653
- YOU'RE WRONG.

18:45.753 --> 18:48.619
WE'VE ALL COME TO THINK OF YOU AS--AS A PART OF THE TEAM.

18:48.719 --> 18:49.819
- YEAH, RIGHT.

18:49.920 --> 18:51.854
THAT'S WHY APE-FACE AND HIS HORNED-NOSE PAL

18:51.953 --> 18:53.186
WANT TO WIPE MY CORE.

18:53.287 --> 18:54.620
- YOU'RE MISTAKEN.

18:54.720 --> 18:56.021
THEY WOULD NEVER DO THAT.

18:56.121 --> 18:59.488
- I HEARD THEM SAY IT.

18:59.588 --> 19:03.022
[whoosh]

19:03.122 --> 19:04.389
- OH, THANK PRIMUS.

19:04.489 --> 19:05.756
IT'S OPTIMUS.

19:05.856 --> 19:07.455
- IT'S TIME FOR ME TO GO.

19:07.556 --> 19:09.156
IT'S BEEN A SURGE.

19:09.256 --> 19:10.156
- OH, NO. - UNH.

19:10.256 --> 19:11.523
- THIS TIME, YOU STAY.

19:11.623 --> 19:13.024
- LET GO!

19:13.124 --> 19:15.391
I DON'T WANT TO HURT YOU, BUT I WILL!

19:15.491 --> 19:18.324
- YOU'VE ALREADY HURT ME,

19:18.424 --> 19:20.658
BUT YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR THE TRUTH IF IT--

19:20.758 --> 19:22.592
[whip, crack]

19:22.692 --> 19:25.359
OW.

19:25.458 --> 19:27.026
- WARNED YA.

19:27.126 --> 19:31.360
OH, NOT SUCH A GREAT IDEA.

19:31.459 --> 19:34.427
[both groaning]

19:39.194 --> 19:42.062
- YOU BOTH LOOK LIKE SCRAP.

19:42.162 --> 19:46.963
- UH, YES, WE HAD A--A SLIGHT ALTERCATION WITH DINOBOT.

19:47.062 --> 19:48.429
MY FAULT, ACTUALLY.

19:48.529 --> 19:50.297
- NO WAY.

19:50.397 --> 19:53.931
I HEARD YOU AND RHINOX PLANNING TO UNZIP MY CORE.

19:54.031 --> 19:55.697
SO, I TOOK OFF.

19:55.797 --> 19:59.031
THEN DINOBOT JUMPED ME, AND SPOT HERE RESCUED ME.

19:59.131 --> 20:00.464
- IS IT TRUE, OPTIMUS?

20:00.565 --> 20:02.798
WERE YOU GOING TO REPROGRAM HER?

20:02.898 --> 20:05.232
- WITH REPROGRAMMING, YOU COULD BE THE MAXIMAL

20:05.332 --> 20:06.532
YOU WERE MEANT TO BE.

20:06.632 --> 20:09.767
BUT THE DECISION TO TAKE THAT STEP

20:09.866 --> 20:13.700
IS, AND ALWAYS WILL BE, YOURS TO MAKE.

20:13.800 --> 20:17.034
- YOU MEAN, I HAD A CHOICE?

20:17.134 --> 20:19.901
- THAT IS THE MAXIMAL WAY.

20:20.001 --> 20:22.201
NOW, LET'S GET YOU BOTH BACK TO BASE.

20:22.302 --> 20:25.435
- EXCUSE ME, I BELIEVE THAT'S MY RESPONSIBILITY

20:25.535 --> 20:27.169
AS HER COMMANDER.

20:27.269 --> 20:31.070
- WHICH WE'RE GONNA HAVE A LONG TALK ABOUT LATER.

20:40.271 --> 20:41.405
- BY THE WAY,

20:41.505 --> 20:43.239
THANKS FOR COMING AFTER ME.

20:43.339 --> 20:45.239
IT WAS...SWEET.

20:45.339 --> 20:48.472
- AS WAS THE WAY YOU CONFESSED THE TRUTH TO OPTIMUS.

20:48.573 --> 20:52.407
OH, WE'LL MAKE A MAXIMAL OF YOU YET.

20:52.507 --> 20:54.874
- IN YOUR DREAMS.

20:54.974 --> 20:58.274
I LIKE MYSELF JUST THE WAY I AM,

20:58.374 --> 21:02.042
AND I INTEND TO STAY THIS WAY.

21:02.142 --> 21:05.142
HOME, ROVER!
