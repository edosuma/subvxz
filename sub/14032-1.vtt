00:26.795 --> 00:29.625
<i>THE CENTRE:
Like all things on this hurtling sphere... </i>

00:29.795 --> 00:33.455
<i>... I emerged from the molten center
of creation. </i>

00:34.745 --> 00:37.495
<i>But mine has been a unique path. </i>

00:37.665 --> 00:43.005
<i>Isolated, I developed attributes
beyond those of lesser beings. </i>

00:46.665 --> 00:50.705
<i>Then the sphere was struck
by a vast celestial stone. </i>

00:53.415 --> 00:57.125
<i>Black chunks of death filled the skies... </i>

00:57.295 --> 01:01.005
<i>... and the world
became a chaotic garden of doom. </i>

01:02.375 --> 01:06.335
<i>Soon the sphere began
to nurture new kinds of life. </i>

01:06.495 --> 01:09.215
<i>And there was one
that stood above all the rest. </i>

01:09.375 --> 01:12.496
<i>Its fragile shell belied its vicious nature. </i>

01:12.666 --> 01:14.586
<i>And in what seemed like a heartbeat... </i>

01:14.836 --> 01:20.086
<i>... these things proliferated in both number
and destructive means. </i>

01:22.666 --> 01:26.496
<i>Now they have harnessed
the most destructive force. </i>

01:28.006 --> 01:32.006
<i>And I, The Centre, have concluded... </i>

01:32.166 --> 01:35.796
<i>... that the sphere
must be cleansed of them. </i>

04:02.298 --> 04:05.048
<i>LOIS:
This is Lois Lane on Armed Forces Radio. </i>

04:05.218 --> 04:09.048
<i>Well, boys, it looks like the party's over. 
They signed the ceasefire. </i>

04:09.218 --> 04:11.668
<i>So have a drink and smoke them
if you got them. </i>

04:12.008 --> 04:14.218
<i>We're going home. </i>

04:20.588 --> 04:24.218
Some way to end a war, huh, kid?
Nobody wins, nobody loses.

04:24.378 --> 04:26.878
HAL:
Long as it's over, Ace. I got plans.

04:27.048 --> 04:29.538
Right, I forgot.
You're gonna be a space ranger.

04:30.878 --> 04:33.298
HAL: The proper term is "test pilot,"
funny man.

04:33.668 --> 04:37.048
I'm gonna see the stars, close up.

04:38.498 --> 04:39.958
Hey.

04:43.458 --> 04:46.048
ACE: Sons of bitches must not have heard
about the ceasefire.

04:49.668 --> 04:53.418
<i>HAL: I'm coming back for you. 
ACE: Try using your guns for a change.</i>

05:06.538 --> 05:08.048
<i>HAL:
Can you make it back now, Ace? </i>

05:08.258 --> 05:10.838
ACE: Roger that.
Gotta get me a new pair of skivvies.

05:12.498 --> 05:14.338
HAL:
Got another bogey.

05:19.628 --> 05:21.748
<i>ACE:
Hal, your engine. </i>

05:21.918 --> 05:23.258
<i>Punch out. Punch out! </i>

06:08.259 --> 06:11.379
Listen to me. War over.

06:12.709 --> 06:14.129
Finished.

06:33.219 --> 06:34.839
It's over.

06:35.419 --> 06:38.089
War over.

07:01.750 --> 07:04.010
ERDEL:
I'm so sorry.

07:04.170 --> 07:09.170
All I wanted was to send a signal
to Mars.

07:10.010 --> 07:14.050
How could I have known
it would teleport you here?

07:17.540 --> 07:21.050
I suppose we both got the shock
of our lives.

07:22.220 --> 07:27.010
But your heart must be stronger
than mine.

07:27.380 --> 07:29.960
Whoever you are...

07:31.380 --> 07:34.050
...forgive me.

08:29.591 --> 08:30.751
Come on in, Kal.

08:31.461 --> 08:33.260
Join the celebration.

08:33.711 --> 08:35.961
Diana, what's going on here?

08:36.541 --> 08:38.541
Tell them they'd be wasting their bullets.

08:40.341 --> 08:43.881
Don't judge them, Kal.
They get a little nervous around men now.

08:44.131 --> 08:46.631
- What are you talking about?
- I was heading upriver...

08:46.801 --> 08:49.131
...when I passed this village
about four days ago.

08:49.301 --> 08:52.131
The people here helped the French.
The rebels didn't like that.

08:52.301 --> 08:55.461
They murdered the men and children
and they threw them in the river.

08:55.631 --> 09:01.091
<i>These women were beaten and penned
in tiger cages for the rebels to use. </i>

09:02.131 --> 09:04.381
<i>SUPERMAN:
The rebels, how did they die? </i>

09:04.541 --> 09:06.051
<i>WONDER WOMAN:
I only disarmed them. </i>

09:08.381 --> 09:11.961
<i>I left their guns in a clearing and
then I let the women out of their cages. </i>

09:17.541 --> 09:19.221
They did this?

09:19.381 --> 09:21.421
And you just stood by and watched?

09:21.591 --> 09:23.841
I gave them freedom
and a chance for justice.

09:24.011 --> 09:27.221
You know, the American way.

09:27.591 --> 09:30.221
This is what the government's afraid of,
Diana.

09:30.381 --> 09:32.461
Us acting like vigilantes.

09:32.631 --> 09:34.631
I have to do what I think is right.

09:35.051 --> 09:37.301
That's what the others said at first,
remember?

09:37.591 --> 09:40.841
And now Batman's a fugitive,
the whole Justice Society's retired...

09:41.011 --> 09:42.962
...and Hourman's dead.

09:43.462 --> 09:44.922
No matter how much good we do...

09:45.092 --> 09:48.132
...deep down, people are always
going to be scared of us.

09:48.462 --> 09:51.302
Isn't that why you and I
signed those loyalty oaths?

09:51.462 --> 09:52.802
Take a look around, Kal.

09:53.422 --> 09:55.422
Oaths don't mean much here.

09:55.592 --> 09:57.842
All I see is suffering and madness.

09:58.842 --> 10:01.542
- But...
- There's the door, spaceman.

10:03.382 --> 10:04.842
Yeah.

10:05.012 --> 10:06.882
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:07.052 --> 10:08.592
Yeah.

10:51.222 --> 10:55.712
<i>MAN 1 [ON TV]: The downed pilot insisted
the island was teeming with dinosaurs... </i>

a search revealed... </i>

10:58.422 --> 11:03.172
<i>... that not only were there no dinosaurs, 
there wasn't even an island. </i>

<i>We keep our farm animals in the farm, 
not in the house. </i>

11:11.753 --> 11:14.053
<i>Not in the bedroom, certainly. </i>

11:16.133 --> 11:18.883
<i>MAN 3:

11:22.173 --> 11:25.263
<i>MAN 4:

SUPERMAN: The last I heard,
she went back to Paradise Island.

11:35.803 --> 11:37.673
LOIS:
It sounds like she's lost her mind.

11:38.923 --> 11:40.633
I don't think it's that simple.

11:40.803 --> 11:43.133
Diana's an Amazon
who's become an American.

11:43.303 --> 11:45.633
She's trying to make sense
of her convictions.

11:45.803 --> 11:48.753
Between her and that Batman character...

11:48.923 --> 11:51.803
- I thought these people were your friends.
- They are.

11:51.963 --> 11:55.053
But neither of them would sacrifice
their principles for a friend.

11:55.223 --> 11:58.463
- Ever since McCarthy came to...
- McCarthy. He's no excuse.

11:58.633 --> 12:02.963
Whatever party, whatever administration,
there'll always be boogeymen like him.

12:03.133 --> 12:04.923
We need our heroes to stand up...

12:05.053 --> 12:08.423
...and show us what this country
is supposed to mean.

12:11.503 --> 12:14.133
We need a leader.

12:32.013 --> 12:34.304

Come on, eight. Come on, eight.

12:39.924 --> 12:42.424
Now why don't you tell me
what we're doing here, Ace?

12:42.594 --> 12:45.174
Told you, Hal, it's a surprise.

12:45.594 --> 12:46.884
You'll find out tomorrow.

12:47.344 --> 12:50.464
Now, roll those dice before they cool off.

12:54.424 --> 12:55.804
Come on, 10.

12:56.264 --> 12:58.264
DEALER:
Ten. It's a winner.

13:00.504 --> 13:02.964
And you have the loveliest light
in your eyes, dig?

13:03.134 --> 13:07.714
- Can we get back to the interview, please?
- Oh, yeah. My philosophy of life.

13:07.884 --> 13:11.134
Tell your readers they gotta do what I do,
live for the moment...

13:11.304 --> 13:14.304
...because it might be our last,
you dig, Miss West?

13:14.464 --> 13:16.634
- Very profound.
- That's me.

13:16.804 --> 13:21.054
I've always been, you know,
deep like that.

13:22.174 --> 13:23.634
MAN:
Time for the sound check, boss.

13:27.804 --> 13:30.014
Back in a moment.

13:30.384 --> 13:32.544

Iris. I thought you had to work tonight.

13:51.054 --> 13:52.094
IRIS:
I do.

13:52.264 --> 13:54.714
But I wanted to tell you
how much I miss you.

13:54.884 --> 13:57.544
- You have no idea.
- Come on, how could you miss me?

13:57.714 --> 14:00.845
You're in Las Vegas interviewing
all those singers and movie stars.

14:01.015 --> 14:02.055
<i>It's the fast lane. </i>

14:02.225 --> 14:05.675
There are lots of potholes
in that lane, let me tell you.

14:07.755 --> 14:09.265
Iris? Iris.

14:15.635 --> 14:19.805
Sorry to interrupt your festivities,
but if you all stay calm...

14:19.965 --> 14:25.095
...we'll be gone as soon as my friends here
come back from the cashiers' booths.

14:29.425 --> 14:33.465
The key phrase was "stay calm."

14:36.755 --> 14:38.055
<i>BARRY:
Iris, what's happening? </i>

14:38.385 --> 14:39.755
COLD:
You there.

14:40.135 --> 14:42.805
The naughty girl on the phone.

14:44.965 --> 14:46.225
Iris!

15:04.715 --> 15:06.845
Just a few more seconds, everyone.

15:08.465 --> 15:10.175
Ah, my ride is here.

15:25.346 --> 15:27.346
Wait.

15:28.386 --> 15:29.426
Make it quick.

15:30.466 --> 15:33.426
Hot damn, Ace.
It's that super-fast guy from Central City.

15:33.636 --> 15:35.676
The Flash. He'll take care of this clown.

15:36.056 --> 15:38.226
I took precautions
in case you dropped by.

15:38.596 --> 15:40.016
If you so much as touch me...

15:40.176 --> 15:43.506
...you'll trigger six cryogenic bombs
I've hidden around the city.

15:43.676 --> 15:47.226
And they'll go off in 90 seconds anyway,
unless you find them.

15:47.596 --> 15:53.546
So it's your choice now.
Me, or the city and everyone in it.

15:53.716 --> 15:55.886
Eighty-nine, 88...

16:00.096 --> 16:01.136
FLASH:
One...

16:01.716 --> 16:03.016
...two, three, four...

16:05.886 --> 16:09.016
...five. Where's six?

16:53.927 --> 16:56.807
It took me a second or two,
but I figured out the sixth bomb...

16:57.017 --> 16:58.757
...was just a wild-goose chase.

16:58.927 --> 17:03.807
[IN THE CENTRE'S VOICE] You are different
from the other lesser beings. Faster.

17:03.967 --> 17:06.967

- Lesser beings?

17:07.137 --> 17:08.467
What are you talking about?

17:11.137 --> 17:12.807
[IN NORMAL VOICE]
Eh? Wha...?

17:15.717 --> 17:16.757
What did you do?

17:16.926 --> 17:19.267
I rewired it on the way down.

17:27.637 --> 17:30.597
Don't ever mess with my Iris.

18:10.177 --> 18:11.547
This little trip's been fun.

18:11.717 --> 18:13.927
Are you ever gonna tell me
where we're headed?

18:14.097 --> 18:17.178
To hell if you don't slow down.
What's wrong with you?

18:17.348 --> 18:19.848
Ever since you got out of the hospital...

18:20.018 --> 18:21.888
It was Korea.

18:22.758 --> 18:24.018
Changed everything.

18:24.388 --> 18:26.178
Wars have a tendency to do that.

18:26.348 --> 18:28.888
HAL: Look, Ace, you know
that ever since I was a kid...

18:29.058 --> 18:32.638
...watching my old man fly,
I wanted to see the stars.

18:32.808 --> 18:34.968
But the war and then the hospital...

18:35.428 --> 18:37.468
...it's like I'm damaged goods.

18:37.638 --> 18:41.388
I can't get a first-class outfit
to take me on. And without a ride...

18:41.928 --> 18:43.548
...I sure can't climb the pyramid.

18:44.468 --> 18:46.548
- Slow down.
- Why bother?

18:46.928 --> 18:49.758
You have to, kid, because we're here.

19:03.508 --> 19:06.268
It's where you get your second chance.

19:07.598 --> 19:09.758
<i>WOMAN [ON TV]:

19:42.389 --> 19:45.969
CAROL: Ace Morgan's recommendation
carries a lot of weight at Ferris Aircraft.

19:46.309 --> 19:48.309
I assume he spoke as well of us to you.

19:48.599 --> 19:53.139
He did. And I can't imagine anywhere else
I'd rather be right now, Miss Ferris.

19:54.099 --> 19:56.639
Do you have any questions?

19:57.309 --> 19:59.809
I'm surprised your father
isn't interviewing me.

19:59.969 --> 20:02.809
- Not that I mind, it's just that you're a...
- A woman?

20:02.969 --> 20:05.969
My father trusts me with the day-to-day
operation of the company.

20:06.139 --> 20:09.179
- If that's good enough for him, it ought to...
- Whoa, wait.

20:09.349 --> 20:13.929
I was only saying that you're a little young
to be running a major corporation.

20:14.349 --> 20:16.679
Oh. Oh, you're good, flyboy...

20:16.849 --> 20:19.179
...but save it for the girls
in the typing pool.

20:19.349 --> 20:20.679
One last question.

20:20.849 --> 20:24.469
In your resume, there's a gap
between July and December of '53.

20:25.269 --> 20:27.469
I was in a VA hospital.

20:27.639 --> 20:28.679
Psych ward.

20:31.139 --> 20:33.679
Most people wouldn't talk about
this kind of thing...

20:33.849 --> 20:35.809
...but I learned a lot about myself there.

20:35.969 --> 20:39.019
I came out knowing who I really am
and what I really want.

20:40.429 --> 20:43.469
You report for training
and security clearance in two weeks.

20:44.179 --> 20:45.759
All right, let's celebrate.

20:45.929 --> 20:48.099
Waiter, some champagne.

20:48.269 --> 20:51.599
Look, Hal,
I don't get involved with my employees.

20:51.759 --> 20:52.849
I understand, Carol...

20:53.229 --> 20:55.309
...but I don't start work
for two more weeks.

20:56.849 --> 20:58.269
Two glasses.

21:02.809 --> 21:06.760
- So where'd this hot tip come from, John?
- A source.

21:08.020 --> 21:09.890
Well, I think I know your secret.

21:10.550 --> 21:12.140
- You do?
- Hm.

21:12.390 --> 21:14.310
The tips you get from out of the blue...

21:14.470 --> 21:17.310
...those hunches of yours
that always turn out to be right.

21:18.600 --> 21:20.350
You're dating a fortuneteller.

21:20.720 --> 21:22.180
No, I...

21:23.970 --> 21:25.890
Something like that.

21:35.510 --> 21:38.850
Try the back.
I'll see if I can pick this lock.

22:25.760 --> 22:27.180
You are the tribute.

22:27.350 --> 22:30.020
Yours is the glory
of nourishing the strength...

22:30.270 --> 22:32.351
...of The Centre.

22:44.181 --> 22:46.101
You okay, John?

22:55.681 --> 22:57.511
No, stay away.

22:57.681 --> 22:59.471
Stay away!

22:59.641 --> 23:02.351
Back off, you're scaring the boy.

23:04.811 --> 23:06.931
You'll be all right now that...

23:13.101 --> 23:15.021
MAN [IN THE CENTRE'S VOICE]:
You will be judged too.

23:16.061 --> 23:18.231
You will all be judged.

23:18.391 --> 23:22.271
Without The Centre, there is no holding.

23:22.931 --> 23:26.101
The Centre? What's The Centre?

23:51.431 --> 23:52.931
<i>MAN:
Jordan, do you copy? </i>

23:53.231 --> 23:55.931
<i>HAL:
Negative, Colonel Flagg, no Jordan here... </i>

23:56.722 --> 23:59.062
<i>...just Spam in a can.

Yes, Captain Personality. </i>

24:04.102 --> 24:06.552

24:07.022 --> 24:09.892
<i>-Hit it. 
- My pleasure.</i>

24:30.512 --> 24:34.432
HAL:
Spam Jordan is now go for exercise 73.

24:35.392 --> 24:38.062
- How's he doing?
- He's tough enough, that's for sure.

24:38.232 --> 24:41.352
- But I'm getting sick of his attitude.
- He's a pilot, Colonel Flagg.

24:41.512 --> 24:43.892
He's used to making decisions
and being in control.

24:44.062 --> 24:46.062
This training goes against his nature.

24:46.312 --> 24:48.602
Can't be helped.
It's all part of the big picture.

24:48.932 --> 24:51.272
Which he hasn't seen yet.

24:57.552 --> 24:58.722
Carol.

24:59.142 --> 25:01.102
I mean, Miss Ferris, afternoon.

25:01.272 --> 25:04.512
Afternoon, Mr. Jordan.
I trust Colonel Flagg is keeping you busy.

25:04.682 --> 25:07.472
This stuff? Child's play, Miss Ferris.

25:07.642 --> 25:09.602
- Perhaps later I could show you...
FLAGG: Jordan.

25:09.762 --> 25:12.182
- What?
- Exercise 73, remember?

25:12.352 --> 25:14.972
Yeah, they tell me 73's the charm.

25:15.142 --> 25:17.142
Good day, Miss Ferris.

25:22.103 --> 25:23.973
- What are his numbers, Harry?
- Uh...

25:24.143 --> 25:27.103
Excellent.
Responses in the 99th percentile.

25:29.433 --> 25:30.103
Hm.

25:43.143 --> 25:46.433
Not that I'm complaining,
but where exactly are you taking me?

25:46.853 --> 25:50.313
- Where have you always wanted to go?
- That's a leading question.

25:50.473 --> 25:52.313
No, I mean, since you were a kid.

25:52.473 --> 25:55.603
- Your big goal?
- The stars.

25:55.763 --> 25:59.763
But at the rate we're going, the Russians
are gonna beat us into orbit by months.

25:59.933 --> 26:02.393
Who said anything about orbit?

26:02.553 --> 26:04.273
HAL:
Whoa!

26:20.763 --> 26:21.933
A hole in the ground.

26:22.353 --> 26:23.933
Isn't that the wrong direction?

26:24.273 --> 26:27.313
Sometimes you have to go through hell
to get to heaven.

26:36.683 --> 26:38.853
What is all this?

26:41.273 --> 26:43.853
Welcome to the real Ferris Aircraft.

27:00.724 --> 27:02.514
See that sour-looking man down there?

27:02.814 --> 27:03.974
He'll explain everything.

27:04.974 --> 27:06.354
His name's Faraday.

27:06.514 --> 27:08.724
Works for the government.

27:09.064 --> 27:11.974
And if you like Rick Flagg,
you'll love him.

27:13.724 --> 27:16.144
FARADAY:
You're weak, erratic, emotional...

27:16.314 --> 27:20.554
...and for my money, at least a little pink.
But I'm told you're the best we've got.

27:22.064 --> 27:23.684
- I...
- You keep your mouth shut...

27:24.024 --> 27:25.144
...and your ears open.

27:25.314 --> 27:28.604
I'm about to share some of this nation's
greatest secrets with you.

27:37.684 --> 27:41.894
Couple of years ago, we found the body
of a radical scientist named Erdel...

27:42.064 --> 27:44.274
...in a small observatory near Gotham.

27:44.434 --> 27:47.234
Somehow,
he'd been able to contact Mars.

27:47.934 --> 27:50.554
Mars? You're joking, right?

27:50.854 --> 27:54.144
Yes, Jordan, I'm a real kidder.

27:54.814 --> 27:57.604
We found this footprint
at the observatory.

27:59.024 --> 28:01.434
Did you find what made that print?

28:01.604 --> 28:02.684
No.

28:03.144 --> 28:06.724
Whatever it is,
it's eluded us for two years.

28:07.144 --> 28:09.184
There's life on Mars, Jordan.

28:09.354 --> 28:11.064
And it's come to Earth.

28:12.104 --> 28:15.065
Look, I'm just a pilot.
What does this have to do with me?

28:23.475 --> 28:25.395
FLAGG:
You haven't figured it out yet?

28:26.065 --> 28:28.475
We've got to know what these Martians
want from us...

28:28.645 --> 28:31.315
...and since we can't find them
here on Earth...

28:31.815 --> 28:33.235
...we're going to Mars.

28:37.725 --> 28:39.645
Outstanding.

28:48.515 --> 28:50.685
BATMAN:
Welcome home, Mr. Jones.

28:50.855 --> 28:51.855
JOHN:
Why didn't I...?

28:52.025 --> 28:54.025
BATMAN:
Why didn't you sense me as you do others?

28:55.395 --> 28:56.435
That's my secret.

28:57.235 --> 28:59.935
Why are you here?
Because of The Centre?

29:00.275 --> 29:03.555
The cult's spreading all over the world.

29:03.725 --> 29:05.935
At first I thought it might be
the communists.

29:06.105 --> 29:08.235
But they're having trouble
with the cults too.

29:08.395 --> 29:09.765
It's not ideological.

29:10.065 --> 29:12.065
There's some kind
of psychic force involved.

29:12.235 --> 29:14.685
It's affecting people
with high susceptibility.

29:15.145 --> 29:17.315
Getting into their minds.

29:17.475 --> 29:18.685
I felt it.

29:19.025 --> 29:22.185
Yes, your feelings. How...?

29:22.355 --> 29:24.515
Let's just say that's my secret.

29:24.685 --> 29:27.515
You came here because
you want to work together, true?

29:27.685 --> 29:30.235
- True.
- Then we'll share our information.

29:31.235 --> 29:32.895
I've already collected some.

29:37.725 --> 29:39.026
Newspaper clippings.

29:39.186 --> 29:41.356
You'll have to do better than that.

29:41.856 --> 29:46.896
And one other thing, I'm not sure
what you are or where you come from...

29:47.066 --> 29:50.146
...but my instincts tell me
you're to be trusted.

29:50.316 --> 29:52.146
Make no mistake, though.

29:52.316 --> 29:54.936
I have a $70,000 sliver
of radioactive meteor...

29:55.106 --> 29:56.726
...to stop the one from Metropolis.

29:57.066 --> 30:01.106
With you, all I need is a penny
for a book of matches.

30:19.556 --> 30:22.856
What's the matter, Grodd,
feeling starved for attention?

30:50.186 --> 30:52.316
MAN 1:
You're government property now, swifty.

30:52.476 --> 30:55.276
We're gonna find out
what makes you tick.

31:03.397 --> 31:04.817
MAN 2: Hey.
MAN 3: Did you see that?

31:04.977 --> 31:06.857
MAN 4:
Where did he go?

31:15.317 --> 31:17.477
BRADLEY:
What you got there, John?

31:18.397 --> 31:20.107
- A kids' book?
- Not exactly.

31:20.277 --> 31:22.687
The author committed suicide
a while back.

31:22.857 --> 31:24.857
He thought the world was about to end.

31:25.027 --> 31:26.937
You like this weird stuff, don't you?

31:27.107 --> 31:30.397
Well, you should see what they got
in the interrogation room.

31:31.397 --> 31:33.357
He shot a cop on the parkway.

31:33.517 --> 31:35.187
Then we found his mother...

31:35.357 --> 31:37.187
...in his trunk.

31:37.557 --> 31:39.647
- Mental case?
- Not your typical one.

31:39.817 --> 31:42.277
This guy's a scientist.

31:45.027 --> 31:48.107
You're here to kill me, aren't you?
You're part of it.

31:48.277 --> 31:50.357
I'm not going to kill you.

31:50.517 --> 31:52.607
And what do you think I'm part of?

31:52.767 --> 31:54.857
The Centre. It's everywhere.

31:55.687 --> 31:57.317
What do you know about The Centre?

31:57.477 --> 32:00.357
It's gonna kill everyone.
I was trying to get away from it.

32:00.517 --> 32:02.147
How do you know all this?

32:02.517 --> 32:05.937
I just do. I can feel it.

32:06.357 --> 32:10.357
I tried to get in on the Mars mission
but they wouldn't take me.

32:10.517 --> 32:11.937
The Mars mission?

32:12.277 --> 32:14.817
Yes. They're going to Mars.
It's safe there.

32:14.977 --> 32:17.817
- Who is going to Mars?
- The government.

32:17.977 --> 32:20.857
They won't let us normal people go.

32:21.147 --> 32:23.187
Normal people.

32:24.857 --> 32:26.647
Hello, Harry.

32:27.557 --> 32:29.518
I've been very worried about you.

32:29.898 --> 32:31.728
No! Don't let him near me.

32:32.238 --> 32:34.238
Special Agent Faraday.

32:34.608 --> 32:36.688
Harry used to be a hell of a scientist.

32:36.858 --> 32:38.478
Did lots of classified stuff.

32:38.648 --> 32:42.278
We can't leave him in a regular institution
because of what he might spill.

32:42.438 --> 32:44.188
You're referring to the Mars mission?

32:45.188 --> 32:48.028
- The what?
- He told me about a mission to Mars.

32:50.148 --> 32:53.818
He's even farther gone than I thought.
If that's possible.

32:54.108 --> 32:56.818
- Now, come on, Harry.
HARRY: No, please don't let him take me.

32:56.978 --> 32:58.938
Please, please.

33:03.898 --> 33:08.728
Mr. Faraday, if there's anything else
I can do for you, please let me know.

33:09.478 --> 33:10.898
Sure.

33:12.768 --> 33:14.938
<i>We've been able to contact Mars. 
Life on Mars. </i>

33:15.108 --> 33:17.278
<i>We're going to Mars. </i>

33:18.648 --> 33:20.728
See you around, Jones.

33:23.358 --> 33:25.398
<i>JOHN:

<i>I've always used my power

33:49.108 --> 33:51.108
<i>You just saw what happened

33:51.278 --> 33:52.978
<i>America needs more people like him. </i>

33:53.238 --> 33:56.819
<i>But where are they going to come from

33:57.149 --> 34:01.239
<i>As for me, I'm quitting, giving it up. </i>

34:01.399 --> 34:05.319
<i>Breaks my heart but there are people I love. 
I don't want anything to happen to them. </i>

34:05.479 --> 34:09.559
<i>So good night, everybody, and good luck. </i>

34:12.478 --> 34:15.319
- Who needed him anyway?
- Probably some kind of crook.

34:15.478 --> 34:17.819
- Definitely a freak.
- Definitely.

34:17.978 --> 34:21.859
And what was with that red costume?
Red's for commies.

34:22.518 --> 34:25.438
- Hey, where are you going?
JOHN: Home.

34:57.819 --> 34:59.559
BATMAN:
Mr. Jones...

34:59.859 --> 35:01.189
...how did you locate me?

35:01.399 --> 35:05.649
I may not be the world's greatest
detective, but I have my methods.

35:06.029 --> 35:08.559
This is all the information
I've been able to collect.

35:08.729 --> 35:09.859
It's the last of it.

35:11.609 --> 35:15.479
I thought I could make a life for myself
here among you humans.

35:15.649 --> 35:17.859
I didn't think I had a choice.

35:18.029 --> 35:19.359
But there is one now.

35:20.770 --> 35:24.400
There's just too much hatred here,
too much ignorance...

35:24.560 --> 35:27.360
...too much mindless conformity.

35:27.860 --> 35:29.400
I'm leaving.

35:30.560 --> 35:31.730
BATMAN:
Have a nice trip.

35:31.900 --> 35:33.820
Some of us don't have that luxury.

35:42.650 --> 35:44.480

Almost there.

38:03.981 --> 38:05.191
We're losing pressure.

38:10.562 --> 38:13.362
- We're gonna have to take her back.
- Too risky.

38:13.612 --> 38:14.652
Jordan, listen to me.

38:14.822 --> 38:17.242
- We have weapons on board.
- What?

38:17.402 --> 38:19.562
In case the Martians
turned out to be hostile.

38:20.242 --> 38:24.032
Nerve gas, germ bombs, even nuclear.

38:25.112 --> 38:28.072
Doesn't make a difference.
I can still land this thing.

38:29.692 --> 38:31.612
- What's that?
- It's a destruct switch.

38:32.072 --> 38:34.692
I'm sorry, Jordan,
but you knew the risks.

38:38.032 --> 38:39.112
You just relax, colonel.

38:56.522 --> 38:59.072
You son of a bitch.

38:59.862 --> 39:01.362
Jordan, put Flagg back on.

39:01.652 --> 39:04.522
No can do, Faraday. He's indisposed.

39:06.772 --> 39:08.192

39:24.482 --> 39:26.112
Flagg, don't. I can land it.

42:07.034 --> 42:09.824
- You have to admit...
- Listen, you've seen the power he has.

42:09.984 --> 42:12.034
He could leave this place
any time he wants.

42:12.194 --> 42:13.734
But he hasn't.

42:13.904 --> 42:16.324
That should tell you something.

42:23.324 --> 42:25.904
Tell me about this America, Diana.

42:26.154 --> 42:27.825
It's changed since the war.

42:27.985 --> 42:31.115
Back then, we were in the right.
It was simple.

42:33.325 --> 42:36.325
They still say they're in the right
but they don't act that way.

42:36.565 --> 42:37.825
Men.

42:43.115 --> 42:44.985
Things have changed here too, Diana.

42:45.155 --> 42:48.865
A lot of us are beginning to think we need
a leader who sticks closer to home.

42:49.245 --> 42:51.155
WONDER WOMAN:
And who would such a leader be?

42:51.325 --> 42:52.865
You?

43:00.195 --> 43:02.905
You might need a little more seasoning.

44:35.776 --> 44:37.366
Hal Jordan.

44:38.196 --> 44:39.736
You know me?

44:39.906 --> 44:41.366
Who are you?

44:41.736 --> 44:43.946
I am...

44:44.736 --> 44:46.406
...Abin Sur.

44:46.656 --> 44:49.156
You need a doctor. Let me...

44:49.656 --> 44:51.656
Listen to me.

44:51.826 --> 44:56.326
What I have to tell you
will seem unbelievable but...

44:59.326 --> 45:04.116
I am the Green Lantern of Sector 2814.

45:04.286 --> 45:06.906
I was on my way here to help.

45:07.156 --> 45:08.986
Help? How?

45:09.406 --> 45:13.826
In the coming battle with The Centre.

45:13.986 --> 45:15.326
Center of what?

45:15.616 --> 45:20.987
It is a monstrous creature
that fears you humans so much...

45:21.527 --> 45:26.657
...it intends to eradicate every
living soul on the planet.

45:27.827 --> 45:31.157
When I was entering your atmosphere
a few days ago...

45:31.327 --> 45:34.327
...there was a huge explosion.

45:34.697 --> 45:37.907
There was too much yellow energy
for me.

45:38.077 --> 45:41.117
I ordered my ring to find you.

45:41.287 --> 45:44.367
I had to find a deserving one.

45:44.527 --> 45:47.447
A man entirely without fear.

45:48.697 --> 45:53.527
A lot of people think I'm a coward
because of what happened in the war.

45:53.697 --> 45:55.287
Did your ring tell you about that?

45:55.567 --> 45:58.527
You are no coward, Hal Jordan.

45:58.777 --> 46:01.867
To you, all life is precious.

46:02.037 --> 46:07.157
And this ring is far too powerful
to fall into the hands of someone...

46:07.327 --> 46:09.407
...who doesn't understand that.

46:27.697 --> 46:29.037
How does this thing work?

46:29.287 --> 46:31.987
The Guardians...

46:32.157 --> 46:35.737
They will...

46:50.528 --> 46:52.248
Wow, you really do know him.

46:52.828 --> 46:53.908
And you must be Robin.

46:54.288 --> 46:56.118
I hear you're quite a detective.

46:56.488 --> 46:58.568
Well, I try not to brag, but...

46:58.738 --> 47:00.408
Have you finished your homework yet?

47:00.568 --> 47:03.078
Uh... Right.

47:06.078 --> 47:09.198
Hm. New look, a sidekick.

47:09.368 --> 47:12.118
- Do you mind if I ask...?
- As a matter of fact, I do.

47:12.448 --> 47:15.948
Let's just say I set out to scare criminals,
not children.

47:16.328 --> 47:17.778
Fair enough.

47:18.158 --> 47:22.288
This all lines up with dozens of stories
we've run in the Planet this year.

47:22.738 --> 47:25.738
The children's book
is particularly ominous.

47:25.908 --> 47:28.568
As if someone, something else...

47:28.738 --> 47:30.448
...were speaking through the author.

47:30.618 --> 47:34.038
<i>MAN: In its wake. We have a live report
coming in from Cape Canaveral. </i>

47:34.198 --> 47:37.658
<i>LOIS: The creature is hovering over
the large fuel tanks here at the Cape... </i>

47:37.828 --> 47:40.908
<i>... making it impossible for the Army
to use their missiles on it. </i>

47:41.078 --> 47:43.658
<i>- Lois.
-Its wingspan is easily the length... </i>

47:43.828 --> 47:44.988
<i>... of a football field... </i>

47:45.158 --> 47:47.948
<i>... and it looks a lot like
a prehistoric pterodactyl. </i>

47:48.118 --> 47:50.078
<i>But much, much bigger. </i>

47:56.448 --> 47:59.288
I'm not sure of what it's trying to do.

48:41.739 --> 48:43.489
Diana.

48:44.739 --> 48:47.779
Haven't flown this thing in years.

48:48.199 --> 48:49.739
Guess I'm a little rusty.

48:49.909 --> 48:51.329
Easy, easy.

48:51.779 --> 48:55.909
We fought it, hard as we could, but...

48:59.039 --> 49:00.989
It's coming, Kal.

49:01.159 --> 49:03.529
It's coming here.

49:08.409 --> 49:09.409
Medic!

49:10.289 --> 49:13.079
FARADAY: We know this place could
never hold someone with your powers.

49:13.489 --> 49:16.909
- Why do you stay?
- I'm determined to beat you at this game.

49:17.079 --> 49:19.739
Without reading your mind.

49:20.079 --> 49:22.199
Come on, level with me.

49:22.869 --> 49:24.619
Very well.

49:24.779 --> 49:28.869
I have looked into your mind,
and by extension, your heart.

49:29.039 --> 49:31.739
You honestly believe
that there will be a better day...

49:31.909 --> 49:33.740
...when all of this won't be necessary.

49:34.330 --> 49:39.620
To find that within you, Mr. Faraday,
has filled my heart with hope.

49:41.990 --> 49:45.250
And I have no place else to go.

49:48.120 --> 49:51.660
This just came in from Washington,
urgent.

49:52.780 --> 49:54.450
It's The Centre, isn't it?

49:54.620 --> 49:57.410
I can feel its presence very strongly now.

49:58.330 --> 50:00.080
You're looking for a place to go?

50:00.370 --> 50:02.450
I got one hell of a destination for you.

50:02.620 --> 50:03.910
But we might not come back.

50:04.830 --> 50:05.870
I'm ready.

50:07.830 --> 50:10.410
The last time I appeared
without warning in this form...

50:10.570 --> 50:11.870
...someone died of fright.

50:12.120 --> 50:14.950
Perhaps I should take a friendlier
appearance.

50:15.120 --> 50:16.950
Suit yourself.

50:19.780 --> 50:21.490
Well?

50:22.490 --> 50:26.080
It's okay. But real men wear pants.

50:35.160 --> 50:38.410
<i>MAN: This absolutely unprecedented
situation off the coast of Florida. </i>

50:38.570 --> 50:40.950
<i>The combined might
of the U.S. Armed Forces... </i>

50:41.120 --> 50:43.370
<i>...had no effect on this... 
- Bourbon, please.</i>

50:43.530 --> 50:45.290
<i>I hardly know what to call it. </i>

50:45.450 --> 50:48.830
<i>It appears we've reestablished contact
with our reporter at the scene. </i>

50:48.990 --> 50:53.910
<i>The only word I can find
to describe the scale of this is "biblical."</i>

50:54.080 --> 50:58.700
<i>It's a living island, 
at least 25 miles across. </i>

51:00.831 --> 51:05.291
<i>It has large ports which
discharge intense blasts of energy... </i>

51:05.451 --> 51:09.531
<i>... but which can also draw things
into the creature. </i>

51:10.621 --> 51:15.871
<i>Not two minutes ago, we watched it inhale
an entire aircraft carrier. </i>

51:19.161 --> 51:23.081
<i>The loss of life out here
is incalculable and... </i>

51:23.251 --> 51:27.661
<i>Wait. We're turning around. 
We've been ordered back. </i>

51:27.871 --> 51:29.371
I have to tell you something.

51:29.531 --> 51:31.621
- I'm the F...
IRIS: I already know.

51:31.871 --> 51:33.531
You what?

51:35.701 --> 51:37.371
I'm a reporter, remember?

51:37.531 --> 51:40.781
I always suspected, and I heard your voice
on the news the other night.

51:40.951 --> 51:45.201
I was only trying to protect you.
They think I'm some kind of criminal.

51:45.451 --> 51:46.871
But we know better, don't we?

51:49.951 --> 51:51.371
So, what are you waiting for?

51:51.531 --> 51:55.291
You know who's going to be there?
Superman, Wonder Woman, people like that.

51:55.451 --> 51:58.621
I'm just a guy who runs
after jewelry thieves and talking gorillas.

51:58.781 --> 52:00.121
You're more than that.

52:00.291 --> 52:02.451
And you're going to prove it.

52:19.991 --> 52:21.411
CAROL:
What are you doing?

52:23.161 --> 52:26.162
Where have you been?
And what happened to the simulator?

52:26.332 --> 52:27.452
Long story.

52:27.622 --> 52:30.292
Have you seen the news?
Do you have any idea what's...

52:32.252 --> 52:33.622
Oh, God.

52:33.782 --> 52:35.622
You're going down there, aren't you?

52:35.782 --> 52:39.082
Hal the pacifist is going down there
to get killed by that thing.

52:39.252 --> 52:40.662
What would you have me do?

52:40.832 --> 52:42.452
Or do you think I'm a coward too?

52:42.622 --> 52:44.622
I looked up your war record.

52:44.782 --> 52:47.122
You never fired
at those North Korean planes.

52:47.292 --> 52:51.082
Maybe I just didn't believe that what
we were doing there was worth killing for.

52:51.252 --> 52:54.622
But in that trench,
I found out what would make me kill.

52:54.782 --> 52:58.912
Survival. I would kill to survive.

53:02.532 --> 53:06.082
Aren't you going to at least say goodbye?

53:06.252 --> 53:07.912
Don't you...?

53:28.532 --> 53:30.412
Whoa. We're just here to help.

53:34.122 --> 53:37.832
We don't need help.
Especially not from you.

53:38.872 --> 53:41.662
You think you can hit me?
It's been tried before.

53:41.912 --> 53:43.832
Don't push us, mister.

53:52.453 --> 53:55.203
SUPERMAN:
I see I have your attention.

53:55.623 --> 53:58.953
We face a threat big enough
to wipe us off the Earth...

53:59.123 --> 54:02.953
...and still we bicker about a mask
or a uniform.

54:03.123 --> 54:05.993
My best friend is lying upstairs right now.

54:06.163 --> 54:08.533
She would have given her life
for this country...

54:08.703 --> 54:12.493
...and I could hardly look her in the eye.
America was founded on the notion...

54:12.663 --> 54:15.453
...that a person should be free
to follow his or her destiny.

54:15.623 --> 54:18.833
But we can't do that if we're living in fear
of our own government.

54:19.123 --> 54:23.373
We need to reclaim this country
for free men and women everywhere.

54:23.533 --> 54:26.663
- What about your government friends?
FARADAY: That's a fair question.

54:27.203 --> 54:28.373
Superman's right.

54:28.533 --> 54:30.573
The persecution and paranoia
have to stop.

54:30.743 --> 54:35.083
From here on,
we work together as free Americans.

54:41.743 --> 54:44.833
I'm gonna fly out now
and recon this thing.

54:47.743 --> 54:50.703
When I get back,
we'll work out a strategy.

54:50.873 --> 54:51.913
Are you with me?

55:53.374 --> 55:56.834
<i>LOIS:
America's champion, Superman... </i>

55:56.994 --> 56:00.834
...went down in defeat several hours ago.

56:00.994 --> 56:05.494
An exhaustive search
has found no sign of him.

56:06.414 --> 56:10.044
Here at the Cape,
the greatest minds in the free world...

56:10.204 --> 56:14.624
...are now working on a plan to stop
this monster...

56:14.784 --> 56:16.994
...before it reaches the coast.

56:17.374 --> 56:19.574
We cannot panic.

56:20.494 --> 56:25.294
We cannot let our sense of loss...

56:35.414 --> 56:36.664
MAN:
If this book's right...

56:36.834 --> 56:39.494
...it's a whole new life form
we've never even imagined.

56:40.534 --> 56:44.045
HALEY: Or it could be nothing more than
the ravings of some demented cartoonist.

56:46.335 --> 56:49.375
BATMAN:
It's not. I assure you.

56:49.535 --> 56:52.375
And there's only one way
to stop this thing now.

56:52.535 --> 56:54.295
I want you all to listen to this man.

56:54.455 --> 56:58.375
Gentlemen, I'm Ray Palmer
from Ivy University.

56:58.535 --> 57:01.165
I've heard of you, Palmer,
and your invention.

57:01.335 --> 57:02.535
Matter reduction, right?

57:02.705 --> 57:05.045
- Right. I...
HALEY: It won't work.

57:05.205 --> 57:07.455
Everything it shrinks becomes unstable.

57:07.625 --> 57:08.875
Exactly.

57:12.535 --> 57:14.455
FARADAY:
We start with an all-out aerial assault.

57:14.625 --> 57:17.995
We hit the thing from every direction
at once. That's a distraction.

57:18.415 --> 57:21.165
While it's fighting the Air Corps,
we use this baby on it.

57:21.745 --> 57:24.915
This gizmo uses light to shrink things.

57:28.915 --> 57:30.045
- Question...
- Wait.

57:30.205 --> 57:32.335
Everything the ray shrinks
becomes unstable.

57:34.915 --> 57:37.415
Meaning, it explodes.

57:37.835 --> 57:38.875
Still have a question?

57:39.045 --> 57:42.165
That thing out there is one
hell of a lot bigger than an orange.

57:42.335 --> 57:44.165
- How are you gonna...?
- It is big.

57:44.335 --> 57:47.665
And that's why we have to expose
its surface to the ray piece by piece.

57:47.915 --> 57:51.455
All in the blink of an eye?
That's impossible without Superman.

57:51.625 --> 57:55.665
No, it's not impossible, is it?

57:57.165 --> 57:58.255
Piece of cake.

57:58.665 --> 57:59.915
Any other questions?

58:00.085 --> 58:01.625
HAL: Just one.
- Jordan.

58:01.785 --> 58:04.335
- About time.
- Attacking the surface won't be enough...

58:04.495 --> 58:05.785
...to distract this thing.

58:05.955 --> 58:08.836
You need someone
to go inside with bombs.

58:08.996 --> 58:10.876
- You volunteering?
- He'd better...

58:11.046 --> 58:13.256
...because I'm not going in there alone.

58:13.416 --> 58:15.416
Outstanding.

58:24.666 --> 58:26.626
<i>FARADAY:
All of you, remember... </i>

58:26.786 --> 58:29.456
<i>... today there are no Democrats, 
no Republicans. </i>

58:29.626 --> 58:31.956
<i>No hawks, no doves. </i>

58:32.126 --> 58:34.996
<i>Just the naked simplicity of an absolute: </i>

58:35.206 --> 58:37.416
<i>Mankind's survival. </i>

58:37.956 --> 58:39.996
<i>Good luck to us all. </i>

59:11.456 --> 59:12.666
All right, men.

59:12.836 --> 59:16.296
Our job is to protect Flash until Morgan
and Jordan light it up.

59:16.456 --> 59:17.836
- I want...
MAN: Hey, look out!

01:01:03.788 --> 01:01:06.338
Hawk! Ah!

01:01:35.128 --> 01:01:40.498
- Are you all right?
- It's attacking my mind.

01:02:32.879 --> 01:02:35.049
All of you, fight on!

01:02:35.209 --> 01:02:37.959
To the last breath, fight on!

01:02:39.129 --> 01:02:40.709
All weapons systems hot.

01:02:40.879 --> 01:02:43.999
<i>ACE: Like they say, it ain't when you go, 
it's how you go. </i>

01:03:17.919 --> 01:03:20.339
ACE: Uh, Hal?
HAL: What's wrong?

01:03:20.499 --> 01:03:22.129
Whatever you see, ignore it.

01:03:22.299 --> 01:03:24.379
Just keep going. Acknowledge.

01:03:26.499 --> 01:03:28.749
Just keep going. No problem.

01:03:37.789 --> 01:03:39.299
What now?

01:03:42.459 --> 01:03:45.789
This stuff is no hallucination,
I'll tell you that.

01:03:51.540 --> 01:03:54.130
And whatever it is,
I think it's trying to get inside.

01:03:57.880 --> 01:04:00.300
Drop the bombs,
then we'll burn our way out.

01:04:00.460 --> 01:04:01.580
Roger that.

01:04:08.210 --> 01:04:09.460
My rockets are dead.

01:04:09.630 --> 01:04:10.960
Can't open bomb bay doors.

01:04:11.130 --> 01:04:12.630
<i>- Hal?
-I'm here. </i>

01:04:12.790 --> 01:04:15.630
We've had our ride
and it's time to punch our ticket.

01:04:15.790 --> 01:04:17.790
<i>Initiate manual detonation. </i>

01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:19.840
Roger.

01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:31.710
<i>MAN:
Hal Jordan, you are the key. </i>

01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:34.090
<i>Your will drives the ring. </i>

01:04:34.260 --> 01:04:38.920
<i>Clear your mind
and focus on what matters. </i>

01:05:26.381 --> 01:05:28.341
Hal? What...?

01:05:28.501 --> 01:05:30.001
Later.

01:05:33.541 --> 01:05:34.881
You're afraid.

01:05:35.051 --> 01:05:36.711
It's all on me.

01:05:36.921 --> 01:05:38.261
The whole thing.

01:05:38.671 --> 01:05:40.631
We'll be there for you.

01:05:40.791 --> 01:05:42.751
We all will.

01:05:49.541 --> 01:05:50.751
Godspeed.

01:06:39.002 --> 01:06:41.712
He did it. Son of a bitch.

01:06:52.882 --> 01:06:54.132
I was afraid...

01:06:54.302 --> 01:06:56.962
...I'd be late for the victory party.

01:07:02.172 --> 01:07:03.342
Spoke too soon.

01:07:14.502 --> 01:07:18.712
That thing's gonna do a lot of damage.
Guess it's time to see what this ring can do.

01:07:18.882 --> 01:07:19.922
Hey.

01:07:23.132 --> 01:07:24.582
GREEN LANTERN:
Sorry.

01:07:34.052 --> 01:07:36.502
That guy with the ring,
he wasn't part of the plan.

01:07:36.672 --> 01:07:37.962
Or wasn't I listening?

01:07:41.962 --> 01:07:44.502
<i>THE CENTRE:
You won't be able to do it. </i>

01:07:44.672 --> 01:07:47.842
<i>It is The Centre that holds, not you. </i>

01:07:48.172 --> 01:07:51.052
I can. I can.

01:07:51.342 --> 01:07:54.882
<i>You do not have the will. </i>

01:07:55.212 --> 01:07:56.382
No?

01:07:56.542 --> 01:07:58.212
Watch.

01:08:39.383 --> 01:08:41.752
Whoo-hoo!

01:08:52.093 --> 01:08:54.263
Hey, Ace, what happened
to that buddy of yours?

01:08:54.423 --> 01:08:55.542
Hal Jordan?

01:08:55.712 --> 01:08:59.093
If I know him, he's up there somewhere
tear-assing around.

01:09:32.714 --> 01:09:34.884
I am Arthur of Atlantis.

01:09:35.054 --> 01:09:38.964
This one has been asking
for a woman named Lois.

01:10:05.344 --> 01:10:09.004
<i>MAN: The pioneers gave up their safety, 
their comfort... </i>

01:10:09.174 --> 01:10:13.544
<i>... and sometimes their lives
to build our new West. </i>

01:10:13.714 --> 01:10:18.304
<i>They were determined
to make the new world strong and free... </i>

01:10:18.464 --> 01:10:21.304
<i>... an example to the world. </i>

01:10:21.544 --> 01:10:25.214
<i>Some would say that those struggles
are all over. </i>

01:10:25.384 --> 01:10:28.004
<i>That all the horizons have been explored. </i>

01:10:28.174 --> 01:10:30.544
<i>That all the battles have been won. </i>

01:10:30.714 --> 01:10:34.264
<i>That there is no longer
an American frontier. </i>

01:10:36.214 --> 01:10:40.544
<i>And we stand today on the edge
of a new frontier. </i>

01:10:40.714 --> 01:10:45.134
<i>The frontier of unknown opportunities
and perils. </i>

01:10:45.304 --> 01:10:51.134
<i>Beyond that frontier are uncharted areas
of science and space. </i>

01:10:51.304 --> 01:10:54.134
<i>Unsolved problems of peace and war. </i>

01:10:54.304 --> 01:10:59.055
<i>Unconquered pockets
of ignorance and prejudice. </i>

01:11:00.385 --> 01:11:02.425
<i>I'm asking each of you... </i>

01:11:02.585 --> 01:11:06.055
<i>... to be pioneers
towards that new frontier. </i>

01:11:06.215 --> 01:11:10.635
<i>My call is to the young at heart, 
regardless of age. </i>

01:11:10.795 --> 01:11:13.385
<i>Can we carry through in an age... </i>

01:11:13.545 --> 01:11:18.005
<i>... where we will witness not only new
breakthroughs in weapons of destruction... </i>

01:11:18.175 --> 01:11:21.505
<i>... but also a race for mastery
of the sky and the rain... </i>

01:11:21.675 --> 01:11:25.425
<i>... the ocean and the tides, 
the far side of space... </i>

01:11:25.585 --> 01:11:28.425
<i>... and the inside of men's minds? </i>

01:11:29.305 --> 01:11:32.265
<i>All mankind waits upon our decision. </i>

01:11:32.425 --> 01:11:37.095
<i>A whole world looks to see
what we shall do. </i>

01:11:37.585 --> 01:11:43.095
<i>And we cannot fail their trust. 
And we cannot fail to try. </i>
