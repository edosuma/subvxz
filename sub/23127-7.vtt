WEBVTT

00:02.300 --> 00:04.120
- (Nora):
Previously on Being Human.

00:04.170 --> 00:04.625
(Screams)

00:05.330 --> 00:06.434
- There's something after me.

00:06.470 --> 00:09.360
Something that I let loose
into my world.

00:09.410 --> 00:10.935
Reaper!

00:11.310 --> 00:12.334
- Yes?

00:12.380 --> 00:14.474
- Hegeman and I were
to share a ride home together.

00:14.510 --> 00:16.148
And now he's missing.

00:17.750 --> 00:19.172
(Growling)

00:19.220 --> 00:20.949
- I know that it's my wolf!

00:20.980 --> 00:22.709
- She just wants to run free.

00:22.750 --> 00:24.081
- Oh my God!

00:24.120 --> 00:25.849
(Screaming)

00:25.890 --> 00:27.779
- A man named William Cart
was found dead

00:27.820 --> 00:29.481
at his worksite last week.

00:29.530 --> 00:31.419
And he's an ex of
your girlfriend's.

00:31.460 --> 00:32.621
- Nora killed her ex boyfriend.

00:32.659 --> 00:36.290
And I need your vampire cop
to help make all this go away.

00:36.330 --> 00:37.468
Cecilia, right?

00:37.500 --> 00:40.868
Want if I can get you the wolves
who killed Hegeman?

00:40.900 --> 00:42.459
Her address is in there too.

00:42.510 --> 00:44.968
- Whatever happened
to wolves running in packs?

00:45.010 --> 00:46.136
- I'm not one of them.

00:48.240 --> 00:49.844
(Werewolf growling)

00:49.880 --> 00:51.473
- (Nora): From the moment
we're born,

00:51.510 --> 00:53.217
we're put into categories.

00:57.390 --> 00:58.789
(Growling)

00:58.820 --> 01:02.358
We spend so much of our lives
trying to define ourselves.

01:02.390 --> 01:05.849
But the truth is,
there are only 2 categories...

01:07.430 --> 01:09.797
predator and prey.

01:10.970 --> 01:12.893
- Aidan!

01:12.940 --> 01:14.829
- They're coming.
- How many are there?

01:14.870 --> 01:17.100
- Four.
- We cannot survive four!

01:17.140 --> 01:18.938
- Shhh! Atlee, listen to me.

01:18.970 --> 01:21.029
We have to be strong
for Hegemen.

01:33.160 --> 01:35.049
(Werewolf growling)

01:37.830 --> 01:38.922
Nora?

01:43.830 --> 01:46.765
- Once you choose
which side you're on,

01:46.800 --> 01:49.201
can you live with
the consequences?

01:52.880 --> 01:54.109
- Nora?

01:55.140 --> 01:57.006
Oh God, are you...

02:01.180 --> 02:02.818
What did we do?

02:05.890 --> 02:08.860
(Tap squeaking, water stopping)

02:51.130 --> 02:53.292
- Why is the bathroom mirror
calling me a whore?

02:53.340 --> 02:54.592
- I have no idea.

02:54.640 --> 02:58.361
- Ok so there's this extremely
lame Poltergeist homage

02:58.410 --> 02:59.502
going on in the
kitchen right now.

02:59.540 --> 03:01.508
So, Sally?
- What?

03:01.540 --> 03:03.907
- OK, with the lights,
can we just--

03:03.950 --> 03:05.406
I'm gonna have a seizure.
I'm literally--

03:05.450 --> 03:07.942
- Guys, this isn't me.
I swear.

03:07.980 --> 03:11.245
Why does everyone just
assume that it's my fault?

03:11.290 --> 03:13.452
How do we know
that's even a ghost?

03:13.490 --> 03:15.879
I think we've all collectively
pissed off enough people

03:15.920 --> 03:17.558
to wage a short
but consequential war.

03:17.590 --> 03:19.399
- Oh come on!
Don't look at me.

03:19.430 --> 03:21.194
My people can't enter
without an invitation.

03:21.230 --> 03:23.961
- Also, neither of us recently
played Maria von Tramp

03:24.000 --> 03:26.059
to a group of ghostly
teenage wastelands.

03:26.100 --> 03:28.740
- OK, those are my friends.
All right?

03:28.770 --> 03:31.660
Except for that one guy
who tried to rape me.

03:31.710 --> 03:33.235
But he's dead! Holla!

03:33.280 --> 03:34.679
- OK, with the lights,
I'm gonna--

03:34.710 --> 03:37.247
Honestly, I'm going to hurl.

03:38.510 --> 03:40.547
- It's fine.
But you know what?

03:40.580 --> 03:43.083
Please, just find a way
to make it stop!

03:43.120 --> 03:44.519
- Sure!

03:45.520 --> 03:46.988
(Door slams)

03:47.990 --> 03:49.526
(Siren)

03:54.030 --> 03:55.429
- Aidan.

03:56.600 --> 03:58.068
- Atlee.

03:58.970 --> 04:01.439
I didn't know that
you were in Boston.

04:01.470 --> 04:02.540
- There is a situation.

04:02.570 --> 04:04.538
- Could we meet
at the hotel later?

04:04.570 --> 04:07.232
These hallways are not meant
for discussing business.

04:07.280 --> 04:09.237
- I will never understand
the Boston clan

04:09.280 --> 04:11.271
and your blatant
disregard for manners.

04:11.310 --> 04:14.416
You are being evasive.
Same as Suren, same as Mother.

04:14.450 --> 04:16.281
- I'm in the middle
of a workday.

04:16.320 --> 04:18.345
- I believe you're aware of
Hegeman's disappearance?

04:18.390 --> 04:19.619
Or should I say death?

04:20.790 --> 04:22.519
- What makes you think
that Hegeman's dead?

04:22.560 --> 04:25.029
- Let's not insult
each other's intelligence.

04:25.060 --> 04:27.449
He was doing Mother's bidding
and then he was gone.

04:27.500 --> 04:29.662
Nobody seems to know
what Mother asked of him.

04:29.700 --> 04:31.566
But yours is the name
that continues

04:31.600 --> 04:33.261
to surface in conversation.

04:33.300 --> 04:35.064
- People talk.

04:35.100 --> 04:37.569
Whatever you heard is
nothing more than idle gossip.

04:37.610 --> 04:39.533
- Save for the fact
that you were present

04:39.580 --> 04:41.571
for the slaughter of
our men at Bishop's.

04:41.610 --> 04:44.204
- You mean the night that
I saved Hegeman's life?

04:44.250 --> 04:46.673
- Which is why
you are still alive.

04:48.480 --> 04:51.518
- I am not
the enemy, Atlee.

04:51.550 --> 04:53.450
- Then you'll
surely understand.

04:53.490 --> 04:56.482
Whoever killed Hegeman
will answer for it.

04:56.530 --> 04:59.124
I'm not leaving Boston
without answers.

05:27.590 --> 05:29.217
- Nora?

05:33.560 --> 05:34.550
Hey.

05:34.600 --> 05:37.228
- Hey.
- When did you get back?

05:37.270 --> 05:39.329
I mean, assuming
that you are back.

05:39.370 --> 05:40.792
- Last night.

05:41.600 --> 05:42.601
Turns out it takes

05:42.640 --> 05:45.462
exactly 16 days of
consecutive sick leave

05:45.510 --> 05:48.377
before HR starts
threatening termination.

05:48.410 --> 05:49.571
- Well...

05:49.610 --> 05:51.169
(Clears throat)

05:51.210 --> 05:54.339
That is an impossibly
stringent policy.

05:55.650 --> 05:58.620
- Plus the Barn's Double B&B
doesn't allow pets.

05:59.760 --> 06:01.580
And I doubt they'd appreciate
me turning tonight

06:01.620 --> 06:03.452
in the guest room.

06:04.630 --> 06:06.428
- It's on the Cape, right?

06:06.460 --> 06:09.669
- Yeah.
- It's a nice place.

06:09.700 --> 06:12.567
Was that a Connor
and Brynn thing?

06:12.600 --> 06:14.193
- I wasn't with them, Josh.

06:14.240 --> 06:16.060
- They said you
were in touch.

06:17.970 --> 06:20.405
- I haven't talked to them
since I left.

06:20.440 --> 06:21.908
It was just me

06:21.940 --> 06:25.570
and the ocean
and a case,

06:25.610 --> 06:28.170
multiple cases of Merlot...

06:29.350 --> 06:31.079
trying to make sense
of the fact

06:31.120 --> 06:34.511
that my wolf tore apart
my ex-boyfriend.

06:34.560 --> 06:36.654
- Yeah, about--about that.
- Don't.

06:36.690 --> 06:39.694
I got your messages.

06:39.730 --> 06:42.495
And whatever happened with
the police investigation,

06:42.530 --> 06:44.089
thank you.

06:45.600 --> 06:47.329
- You should've called me.

06:47.370 --> 06:50.567
- But I feel crappy enough
without you judging me.

06:54.910 --> 06:56.605
- What?

06:56.650 --> 06:58.140
(Sighs)

06:59.180 --> 07:01.046
- I'm sorry.

07:01.820 --> 07:05.688
It's just a lot
being back here.

07:05.720 --> 07:07.210
To be honest...

07:08.720 --> 07:10.722
I didn't know if
you'd wanna see me.

07:10.760 --> 07:12.421
- Of course
I wanna see you.

07:13.430 --> 07:17.526
I mean, maybe I'm not
ready in this moment,

07:17.570 --> 07:19.368
but eventually...

07:19.400 --> 07:20.561
- Eventually?

07:20.600 --> 07:22.329
- Do you even comprehend?

07:22.370 --> 07:27.103
Can you really comprehend
what you did?

07:27.140 --> 07:28.608
How much you hurt me too?

07:32.280 --> 07:34.772
- Wait. Where are
you turning tonight?

07:37.520 --> 07:38.544
I'll be there.

07:40.360 --> 07:41.680
- You don't have
to do that.

07:41.720 --> 07:42.653
- I do.

07:42.690 --> 07:46.388
I have to do something
to make this right.

07:58.270 --> 07:59.578
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:59.610 --> 08:00.771
- How do you think
the hospital would feel

08:00.810 --> 08:02.801
about a missing
EEG machine?

08:04.510 --> 08:07.218
- I think that if you're
trying to get fired,

08:07.250 --> 08:09.469
there are more
sexy ways to do it.

08:09.520 --> 08:12.581
At least tap into some
high-grade pharmaceuticals.

08:12.620 --> 08:14.759
- I have a working
hypothesis about

08:14.790 --> 08:18.283
how the cerebral cortex
evolves during the turn.

08:18.330 --> 08:21.652
I could help--help Nora.

08:21.700 --> 08:23.520
- She's back?
- Yeah.

08:24.270 --> 08:26.932
Yeah, I messed her up, man.

08:26.970 --> 08:28.392
(Sighs)

08:28.440 --> 08:32.160
- It was an accident
and it happened months ago

08:32.210 --> 08:33.575
and you can't keep punishing
yourself like this.

08:33.610 --> 08:36.544
- I know, but I just
have to believe

08:36.580 --> 08:39.504
that there's a way to make
things better, you know,

08:39.549 --> 08:41.245
to fix it.

08:48.760 --> 08:51.684
- What happened with
the murder investigation?

08:54.600 --> 08:55.954
- Oh, uh...

08:56.000 --> 08:58.196
Maybe they thought
it was a wild dog.

08:58.230 --> 08:59.265
I don't know.

08:59.300 --> 09:01.337
The whole case just
kind of disappeared.

09:01.370 --> 09:02.963
- Like Cecilia?

09:04.010 --> 09:06.536
- Cecilia your cop friend?

09:06.580 --> 09:09.333
- Yeah. The one you asked about
to get the cops off your scent.

09:09.380 --> 09:11.508
- Right, which you didn't.

09:11.550 --> 09:14.576
- Yeah. I recall saying
something along the lines of

09:14.620 --> 09:15.610
I didn't wanna see
you get yourself

09:15.650 --> 09:16.845
in more trouble
with vampires.

09:16.890 --> 09:18.813
- Something like that.

09:18.850 --> 09:23.083
- Well, Cecilia also
magically disappeared,

09:23.130 --> 09:24.586
and no one's heard
from her in days.

09:24.630 --> 09:25.859
- Huh.

09:30.800 --> 09:35.431
Well, you know, people
leave this time of year.

09:35.470 --> 09:38.735
Tourists are exhausting
and the weather--

09:38.770 --> 09:39.931
- If you know something,
you must tell me.

09:39.980 --> 09:41.971
The last thing
I need right now

09:42.010 --> 09:44.980
is another vampire
disappearing on my watch.

09:47.750 --> 09:50.720
Josh, please.

09:50.750 --> 09:52.889
- I may or may not
have given her

09:52.920 --> 09:55.309
Hegeman's gun
to kill the twins.

10:01.900 --> 10:04.665
- Why would Cecilia
wanna Kill the twins?

10:04.700 --> 10:06.498
(Grunts)

10:10.970 --> 10:14.133
- Because she may or may not
have been under the impression

10:14.180 --> 10:17.707
that they were the purebred
wolves who killed Hegeman.

10:17.750 --> 10:19.377
What was I supposed to do?

10:19.410 --> 10:21.447
Tell her the truth?
Send her after Nora?

10:21.480 --> 10:22.845
- Do you even
realize the level

10:22.890 --> 10:25.018
of hypocrisy you
are operating under?

10:25.050 --> 10:27.587
- I asked you for help!
- Shhh!

10:27.620 --> 10:29.054
- I was protecting Nora.

10:29.090 --> 10:31.730
If that makes me
a monster, so be it.

10:31.760 --> 10:33.353
And you're one to talk.

10:33.400 --> 10:35.960
Feeding live, preying on
my former fiance.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.469
- This has nothing to do
with Nora or Julia.

10:38.500 --> 10:40.036
This is has to do
with you and me.

10:40.070 --> 10:41.094
- I agree!

10:41.140 --> 10:42.596
- Anything happens
to Cecilia,

10:42.640 --> 10:45.564
you'll be implicated in
not one, but two vampire deaths,

10:45.610 --> 10:47.977
and I'm not even done cleaning
up the mess after the first one.

10:48.010 --> 10:51.105
Now, I came to you and I told
you how deep I would have to go

10:51.150 --> 10:53.915
and I asked you to
be there to pull me out,

10:53.950 --> 10:55.714
not kick me in deeper!

10:55.750 --> 10:57.980
(Breathing heavily)

10:58.020 --> 11:00.717
That is not something
a friend would do!

11:09.700 --> 11:11.395
(Thudding)

11:17.470 --> 11:21.077
- OK, seriously, I know you're
all amped up or whatever

11:21.110 --> 11:22.077
because you've just read

11:22.110 --> 11:25.546
the Complete Idiot's Guide
to Poltergeisting...

11:27.520 --> 11:31.582
but this house is not your
own personal practice space.

11:35.820 --> 11:37.549
Thank you.

11:48.740 --> 11:51.368
- (Danny): Sally!

11:53.410 --> 11:57.608
How I love to watch you die!

11:57.650 --> 11:58.776
- Danny.

12:07.920 --> 12:08.990
- (Cecilia):
You know what to do.

12:09.020 --> 12:10.181
(Beep)

12:10.230 --> 12:13.120
- Cecilia, listen to me.
I know you talked to Josh.

12:13.160 --> 12:16.095
Whatever you have planned,
call it off!

12:18.070 --> 12:20.562
(Sniffing)

12:27.140 --> 12:29.529
(Gasps, clears throat)

12:29.580 --> 12:31.639
Gesundheit.

12:31.680 --> 12:33.079
Sally, I don't have
time right now.

12:33.120 --> 12:34.212
My break is almost up--

12:34.250 --> 12:37.140
- I think Danny sent
a reaper to kill me.

12:38.250 --> 12:41.857
Well, maybe not.
Maybe-- OK.

12:41.890 --> 12:43.688
Either Danny sent
a reaper to kill me

12:43.730 --> 12:45.858
or the reaper is
channelling Danny's voice

12:45.890 --> 12:46.857
to scare the crap
out of me.

12:46.900 --> 12:49.096
- And we're talking about
reapers because...

12:49.130 --> 12:50.996
- Janet saw it too.

12:51.030 --> 12:53.340
She was explaining it to Tim
and that's what she said it was.

12:53.370 --> 12:54.394
- Area per?
- Yes! "

12:54.440 --> 12:56.295
- OK! Good, good, good.

12:56.340 --> 12:58.104
No, no, not good.
Who's Janet?

12:59.740 --> 13:01.834
- The girl who's body
I used to...

13:01.880 --> 13:03.848
- Oh God! OK, I just--

13:03.880 --> 13:07.077
I need a version of this story
that starts with a beginning.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.077
- I tried to sleep one day.

13:09.120 --> 13:10.747
I had a nightmare
about my door

13:10.790 --> 13:13.487
where I opened it and this
darkness came flying out.

13:13.520 --> 13:14.954
And it's been
messing with me.

13:14.990 --> 13:17.084
But it's only been me
until this morning

13:17.130 --> 13:19.485
when it went all Bret
Michaels on the entire house.

13:19.530 --> 13:22.158
Side note: you no longer
have a working microwave.

13:24.400 --> 13:25.697
- What makes you
think it's Danny?

13:25.730 --> 13:26.720
- I don't know who it is,

13:26.770 --> 13:28.260
but it's relentless
and menacing

13:28.300 --> 13:30.610
and it sounds just like Danny.

13:30.640 --> 13:33.029
But it can't be Danny
because Danny's locked up.

13:33.080 --> 13:34.707
- Hey, Sally.

13:38.150 --> 13:39.914
(Sighs)

13:41.550 --> 13:43.587
- "26-year-old inmate
Danny Angeli

13:43.620 --> 13:47.454
"of Suffolk County State Prison
has died in custody.

13:47.490 --> 13:49.379
"Authorities believe
he was killed overnight

13:49.420 --> 13:50.728
"by his cellmate.

13:50.760 --> 13:53.297
"Angeli was serving time
for one count of arson

13:53.330 --> 13:57.119
"and one count of murder
in the third degree."

13:58.730 --> 14:00.061
Holy crap!

14:00.100 --> 14:02.899
- Forget the reaper.
It's Danny's ghost.

14:02.940 --> 14:04.203
- He's coming for revenge.

14:04.240 --> 14:06.004
- You know what?
Even if he is.

14:06.040 --> 14:08.509
Even if he is, you take
a deep breath and you realize

14:08.540 --> 14:09.507
that you've been a ghost

14:09.540 --> 14:12.009
for quadruple the amount
of time that Danny has.

14:12.050 --> 14:13.120
He's got nothing.

14:13.150 --> 14:15.244
** He's got nothing on you

14:15.280 --> 14:17.146
* He's got nothing on you *

14:17.190 --> 14:19.010
- I appreciate
the Zen routine, I do.

14:19.050 --> 14:20.757
But I need a concrete
plan of attack,

14:20.790 --> 14:22.110
not a daily affirmation.

14:22.160 --> 14:23.821
- Simple. Just think of
all you've learned

14:23.860 --> 14:25.885
and how long it took
you to learn it.

14:27.030 --> 14:29.897
There's no possible way
he can be stronger than you.

14:29.930 --> 14:32.126
- I have pulled some pretty
badass moves lately.

14:32.170 --> 14:35.162
- Exactly. I bet he doesn't even
know the trick about iron.

14:35.200 --> 14:39.000
- Right! I mean, everybody
knows the trick about iron.

14:39.040 --> 14:40.769
What's the trick about iron?

14:40.810 --> 14:43.074
- It disperses
paranormal presence.

14:43.110 --> 14:45.545
- Who makes up these rules?
- I don't know.

14:45.580 --> 14:47.309
There's a poker in
the fireplace,

14:47.350 --> 14:49.011
the skillet in
the kitchen--

14:49.050 --> 14:51.041
- Stop! Stop! Just--

14:51.090 --> 14:52.285
Let me get
something straight.

14:52.320 --> 14:54.152
A wooden stake
has to be aimed directly

14:54.190 --> 14:55.089
at your heart to kill you,

14:55.120 --> 14:56.929
while I'm easily destroyed

14:56.960 --> 14:58.655
upon contact with
a common household object?

14:58.690 --> 15:00.624
- Not destroyed, dispersed.

15:00.660 --> 15:02.253
Only for a bit.
It's like a taser.

15:02.300 --> 15:03.665
- Oh, delightful!

15:03.700 --> 15:04.622
- I get off work
in a little bit.

15:04.670 --> 15:05.899
I will come straight home,
but you know what?

15:05.930 --> 15:07.398
Don't be home alone.

15:07.440 --> 15:10.262
There's a girl down the hall in 305
who just had her appendix taken out,

15:10.310 --> 15:12.267
and she's marathoning
the original 90210.

15:12.310 --> 15:15.678
I think "Donna Martin
graduates!" is up next.

15:15.710 --> 15:20.773
And then I will come straight
home and we can do this.

15:20.820 --> 15:24.120
- OK, yeah. Yeah,
we can kick his ass!

15:24.150 --> 15:25.288
- Mm-hmm.

15:25.320 --> 15:28.051
- And if he wants to play,
I say bring it.

15:28.090 --> 15:30.184
That bastard's going down.

15:33.160 --> 15:34.628
(Sighs)

15:38.930 --> 15:40.591
- Oh! OK...

15:40.640 --> 15:42.768
- Please don't leave
for that long again!

15:42.800 --> 15:44.404
- No, I won't.

15:44.440 --> 15:46.659
But you--you guys really
shouldn't be here.

15:46.710 --> 15:48.235
- We were thinking
of going for drinks

15:48.280 --> 15:50.772
before we turn tonight,
celebrate your return.

15:50.810 --> 15:53.780
A new cocktail lounge opened.
They do insane things with acai.

15:53.820 --> 15:55.777
- I'm meeting Josh tonight.

15:56.920 --> 15:58.183
- Friend to friend --

15:58.220 --> 16:00.917
I do think we're on that
level of honesty by now --

16:00.960 --> 16:02.280
you can do better, Nora.

16:02.320 --> 16:05.187
The guy's a tool.
He runs with a vampire.

16:05.230 --> 16:05.924
- The guy's my boyfriend.

16:07.130 --> 16:09.189
And I'm having enough trouble
trying to make things work

16:09.230 --> 16:12.165
without you driving
a wedge between us.

16:12.200 --> 16:14.862
You lied to him about talking
to me while I was gone,

16:14.900 --> 16:17.232
as if things weren't
complicated enough right now.

16:17.270 --> 16:19.534
- OK, wait, wait.
Yes, we lied.

16:19.570 --> 16:20.275
But so did he.

16:21.510 --> 16:24.241
- Did he even tell you how
Will's investigation went away?

16:30.250 --> 16:32.912
- Josh, we need to talk.

16:33.860 --> 16:34.952
- I wanted to talk
to you too, actually.

16:34.990 --> 16:37.960
I noticed some--some
irregularity in my brain--

16:37.990 --> 16:41.494
- Josh! Did Aidan really
send this cop Cecilia

16:41.530 --> 16:42.452
to murder the twins?

16:45.770 --> 16:47.568
- It's not exactly
what happened.

16:47.600 --> 16:50.900
- You knew? And you didn't
try to stop him?

16:50.940 --> 16:52.806
- He was acting as a friend.

16:52.840 --> 16:55.002
- By trying to kill mine!

16:56.040 --> 16:57.371
- This is Aidan!

16:59.380 --> 17:01.109
He's not a terrorist.

17:01.150 --> 17:03.141
He cares about you.
He did this for you!

17:03.190 --> 17:07.080
You go off and you did
this horrible thing.

17:08.589 --> 17:09.409
And then you
just disappeared.

17:09.460 --> 17:11.121
What was he
supposed to think?

17:11.160 --> 17:13.127
He thought you
were in danger.

17:13.160 --> 17:15.253
- So you do think
what I did was horrible?

17:17.069 --> 17:19.164
- You said it yourself,

17:19.200 --> 17:20.270
You tore someone apart.

17:20.300 --> 17:22.233
- Not by choice!

17:22.740 --> 17:23.605
Instinctually.

17:24.970 --> 17:27.371
- Oh! So is that why
you locked yourself up

17:27.410 --> 17:28.229
for over 2 weeks,

17:29.440 --> 17:32.944
to convince yourself that murder
is an acceptable instinct?

17:32.980 --> 17:35.369
- We're wolves, Josh.
It's what we do!

17:35.420 --> 17:36.239
We Kill.

17:36.280 --> 17:38.248
- Well, by that logic,
so do vampires.

17:38.290 --> 17:41.260
Vampires Kill.
Hell, all monsters Kill!

17:41.290 --> 17:45.079
So how is what Aidan did any
different than you killing Will?

17:45.130 --> 17:47.349
- What he did was personal.
- What he did was personal?

17:47.400 --> 17:49.129
But you offing
your ex-boyfriend,

17:49.160 --> 17:50.321
that's somehow not!

17:50.370 --> 17:52.099
Where's the line, Nora?

17:52.130 --> 17:54.360
Or do you just
make it up as you go?

17:56.200 --> 17:59.568
Wow! You're messed up.

18:01.510 --> 18:04.104
The twins really messed you up
worse than I thought.

18:04.150 --> 18:06.278
- You think I'm messed up?
- Yes.

18:07.720 --> 18:11.588
- I'll be turning tonight
with my friends in the shed.

18:16.220 --> 18:18.723
(Cell phone ringing)

18:20.160 --> 18:22.049
- Cecilia, where the hell
have you been?

18:22.100 --> 18:24.569
- Cecilia's terribly sorry
for missing your call.

18:24.600 --> 18:26.762
It's just that we've
been so wrapped up

18:26.800 --> 18:27.961
in our own little world,

18:28.000 --> 18:29.035
getting familiar.

18:29.070 --> 18:30.299
Her backstory is fascinating.

18:30.340 --> 18:32.866
Did you know that her mother
raised 7 children by herself?

18:32.910 --> 18:35.333
I'm overwhelmed Just
thinking about the laundry.

18:35.380 --> 18:36.677
- Who is this?

18:36.710 --> 18:37.905
(Connor chuckles)

18:37.950 --> 18:39.975
- I don't believe that we've
ever been formally introduced.

18:40.010 --> 18:42.047
Well, my name is Connor McLean.

18:42.080 --> 18:44.845
My sister Brynn and I go
a long way back with Josh.

18:44.890 --> 18:46.187
- Mm-hmm, yeah.
Great, the twins.

18:46.220 --> 18:48.086
Put Cecilia on the phone.

18:48.120 --> 18:49.713
(Sighs)

18:51.260 --> 18:52.819
(Grunts)

18:53.660 --> 18:56.994
- Aidan, I made a mistake.

18:57.030 --> 18:59.089
- Yeah, Aidan,
we're both gentlemen here,

18:59.130 --> 19:00.734
so let's just face it.

19:00.770 --> 19:02.397
This is between
you and us.

19:02.440 --> 19:03.407
(Snickers)

19:03.440 --> 19:06.466
No one else need be hurt,
certainly not Cecilia.

19:06.510 --> 19:08.899
- Don't you dare
hurt her anymore.

19:08.940 --> 19:10.840
- And we won't,

19:10.880 --> 19:12.348
assuming that you meet us
in the woods tonight.

19:12.380 --> 19:15.771
The scenery is just
exquisite during a full moon,

19:15.820 --> 19:16.969
don't you think?

19:17.020 --> 19:19.944
All right, what do
you think, Aidan?

19:19.990 --> 19:22.982
Cecilia dies or you Google-Map
your bloodsucking ass

19:23.020 --> 19:24.852
with the coordinates
I'm about to give you.

19:45.550 --> 19:47.279
- Danny?

19:49.820 --> 19:52.118
(Exhales)

19:56.690 --> 19:59.330
Is that the best you got?

20:05.900 --> 20:09.291
Poor thing.
You died in neon.

20:09.340 --> 20:10.762
- Nice to see you too.

20:11.910 --> 20:14.277
I thought about
you every day.

20:14.310 --> 20:16.130
- I'm gonna give your
newbie ghost a beat-down

20:16.180 --> 20:17.739
to right home about.

20:23.820 --> 20:25.584
- You hear about that?

20:25.620 --> 20:27.315
- Aidan...

20:27.360 --> 20:29.488
- I became a ghost
in prison, sweetheart.

20:29.520 --> 20:31.682
Think I didn't learn
your tricks and more?

20:31.730 --> 20:33.596
- I'm sure it was
really badass

20:33.630 --> 20:35.394
being strangled
by your cellmate.

20:36.660 --> 20:38.799
(Laughing)

20:38.830 --> 20:40.696
- You know, the funny
thing about you

20:40.740 --> 20:44.859
is you keep talking and talking,
but I know the more you talk,

20:44.910 --> 20:47.333
the more scared
you really are.

20:48.640 --> 20:50.677
- Was it because you snored

20:50.710 --> 20:52.769
or did you use
too much teeth?

20:54.350 --> 20:55.943
- I don't need this
to kill you.

20:59.720 --> 21:01.654
- Ah!

21:02.820 --> 21:04.151
(Grunts)

21:10.870 --> 21:12.099
Who are you?

21:14.400 --> 21:16.994
- You know exactly who I am.

21:17.040 --> 21:18.303
- Reaper.

21:30.850 --> 21:32.579
- Atlee.

21:34.820 --> 21:36.914
You were right.
They do know more.

21:36.960 --> 21:40.521
There is a threat and it
must be handled delicately.

21:40.560 --> 21:42.528
- Continue.

21:42.560 --> 21:44.790
- The wolves who
murdered Hegeman

21:44.830 --> 21:47.470
are running loose
around the city.

21:47.500 --> 21:48.331
- The wolves?

21:48.370 --> 21:51.465
- The twin wolves
who murdered Hegeman.

21:51.510 --> 21:53.433
They turn in the woods
on the full moon,

21:53.480 --> 21:55.938
but we can take them
together tonight

21:55.980 --> 21:58.244
in the place where
they killed our brother.

22:00.480 --> 22:02.141
I can't do this alone.

22:03.650 --> 22:04.685
- And you shan't.

22:04.720 --> 22:06.848
We'll avenge
Hegeman together.

22:06.890 --> 22:08.358
These wolves...

22:08.390 --> 22:10.757
one for me, one for you.

22:19.930 --> 22:22.399
How can I be sure
you speak the truth?

22:22.440 --> 22:23.760
- Atlee, we gotta
trust each other

22:23.810 --> 22:25.562
if we're gonna
survive the night.

22:25.610 --> 22:27.772
Purebreds are vicious.

22:27.810 --> 22:29.778
- Purebreds?

22:29.810 --> 22:31.608
Purebred wolves?

22:31.650 --> 22:34.312
- Yes. You have dealt
with purebreds before?

22:34.350 --> 22:35.875
- Don't be ridiculous.

22:35.920 --> 22:37.979
What I meant was
they're overconfident,

22:38.020 --> 22:40.239
vulnerable to
the element of surprise.

22:40.290 --> 22:41.917
You draw the wolves
out of hiding,

22:41.960 --> 22:42.916
bring them to me.

22:42.960 --> 22:45.088
Then we can take them
both out together.

22:47.800 --> 22:49.825
(Sighs)

22:50.870 --> 22:52.827
- Wait for me here.

23:18.860 --> 23:20.726
- I don't wanna fight.

23:23.800 --> 23:25.393
Because I love you.

23:27.800 --> 23:30.098
And I wanna be with
you more than anything.

23:32.570 --> 23:34.504
Even if it means

23:34.540 --> 23:37.749
turning in these
woods with them.

23:37.780 --> 23:38.850
(Laughs)

23:38.880 --> 23:41.645
- Bravo! Yeah, bravo!

23:42.820 --> 23:44.219
- Shhh!

23:46.820 --> 23:48.015
(Sniffs)

23:48.960 --> 23:50.724
Our guest has arrived.

23:51.760 --> 23:53.558
You can come in.

24:04.010 --> 24:05.500
- What are you
doing here?

24:05.540 --> 24:07.360
- He's here 'cause
he tried to have us killed.

24:13.410 --> 24:15.412
- Aidan had nothing
to do with it.

24:15.450 --> 24:19.387
- It was me. I sent Cecilia.
- What?

24:20.420 --> 24:21.581
- Twist!

24:21.620 --> 24:22.781
(Chuckles)

24:24.860 --> 24:25.884
(Groans)

24:27.560 --> 24:28.823
- We presumed
some kind of

24:28.860 --> 24:31.921
indirect association,
but responsible?

24:33.600 --> 24:35.398
Kind of perfect you
showed up when you did.

24:35.440 --> 24:36.862
- (Josh): Aidan, get out!

24:36.900 --> 24:38.061
- Oh, he can't leave yet.

24:38.110 --> 24:40.738
We haven't explained the rules.
- Right.

24:40.780 --> 24:42.134
- Rules for what?

24:42.180 --> 24:43.739
- The vampire hunt.

24:43.780 --> 24:46.147
The McLeans' version
of a fox hunt:

24:46.180 --> 24:48.979
beast versus beast
in their truest form.

24:50.020 --> 24:52.648
(Screaming)

24:52.690 --> 24:54.818
- It's been played by
our family for centuries.

24:54.860 --> 24:58.854
And since Boston is nothing if
not a city steeped in tradition,

24:58.890 --> 25:00.949
we felt it only
right to share.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.492
- Where is Cecilia!

25:04.530 --> 25:06.794
- Well, the good news is
she's somewhere in the woods

25:06.830 --> 25:08.161
with your vampire's gun.

25:08.200 --> 25:11.704
The bad news is we
might find her first.

25:11.740 --> 25:14.801
- But the best news
is that you might kill Josh,

25:14.840 --> 25:19.471
or better yet,
Josh might kill you.

25:19.510 --> 25:21.820
- Aidan, get out now!

25:21.850 --> 25:23.443
(Werewolves groaning)

25:24.890 --> 25:26.483
(Screaming)

25:28.760 --> 25:30.819
(Both screaming)

25:38.700 --> 25:40.862
(Both growling)

25:48.110 --> 25:50.374
- So has it been you
the whole time?

25:50.410 --> 25:52.003
Stalking me?

25:52.050 --> 25:53.973
- Stalking sounds
SO unsavoury.

25:54.020 --> 25:55.010
- I'm sorry.

25:55.050 --> 25:57.610
<i>Please help me put it
in a more appealing way.</i>

25:57.650 --> 25:59.414
- When people
live their lives

25:59.450 --> 26:02.317
and do the various
bad things that they do,

26:02.360 --> 26:05.489
they wonder:
"Will there be consequences?"

26:05.530 --> 26:07.328
And the answer is yes.

26:07.360 --> 26:09.522
- I knew not taking my door
was a bad thing.

26:09.560 --> 26:12.598
- It did cause you to emerge
as a person of interest.

26:12.630 --> 26:14.166
There's an order.

26:14.200 --> 26:16.965
I come to those that create
imbalance in that order

26:17.000 --> 26:19.503
and I get rid of them.

26:20.610 --> 26:22.271
- And now you're
here for me.

26:24.950 --> 26:26.839
I didn't pass up
my door on purpose.

26:26.880 --> 26:28.974
I was... I was
saving my friend.

26:29.020 --> 26:29.771
(Sighs)

26:29.820 --> 26:31.709
- It is a conundrum.

26:32.790 --> 26:35.589
The ones I normally
dispose of, they're more...

26:35.620 --> 26:36.781
problematic.

26:36.820 --> 26:40.324
- See? There's some
sketchy stuff going on,

26:40.360 --> 26:42.089
way worse than me.

26:42.130 --> 26:46.192
- You are an interesting case,
Sally Malik.

26:46.230 --> 26:47.265
- What do you mean?

26:47.300 --> 26:50.361
- You're... special.

26:51.640 --> 26:53.165
- You really think so?

26:54.710 --> 26:57.008
- I don't normally converse.

26:57.040 --> 26:58.678
- I sense that.

26:58.710 --> 27:02.840
- The chaos of the afterlife
needs to be contained every day.

27:02.880 --> 27:03.449
Danny...

27:04.390 --> 27:08.179
that helped set
things right for today.

27:08.220 --> 27:09.984
But for tomorrow...

27:11.230 --> 27:13.255
I think you can see
where I'm going with this.

27:16.600 --> 27:19.194
- Just tell me
how much time I have.

27:38.720 --> 27:39.380
- Aidan!

27:40.290 --> 27:42.486
- They're coming.
- How many are there?

27:42.520 --> 27:45.285
- Four.
- We cannot survive four!

27:45.330 --> 27:47.150
- Shhh! Atlee,
listen to me.

27:47.190 --> 27:48.453
We have to be
strong for Hegeman.

27:48.500 --> 27:49.695
- Not when it's
my own funeral.

27:49.730 --> 27:51.323
- You wanna return
to Pennsylvania a coward?

27:51.370 --> 27:53.691
- I'd rather return
a coward than dead!

27:53.740 --> 27:55.697
Godspeed, brother!

28:12.320 --> 28:14.379
- I want you to take this.

28:14.420 --> 28:18.425
It's a--a housewarming gift.

28:18.460 --> 28:20.485
- A fern is
a housewarming gift.

28:20.530 --> 28:22.658
- I can only do this,
live here with you,

28:22.700 --> 28:25.897
if I know that I,

28:25.930 --> 28:28.297
or it, won't hurt you.

28:30.270 --> 28:32.159
I need a nuclear option.

28:32.210 --> 28:33.530
It's silver.

28:34.340 --> 28:36.001
- (Cecilia): Aidan!

28:45.050 --> 28:46.745
Aidan!

28:50.320 --> 28:52.129
(Snarling)

28:53.730 --> 28:55.653
- Nora?

28:58.030 --> 28:59.964
Josh, no.

29:03.270 --> 29:04.669
(Roaring)

29:04.710 --> 29:06.838
Come on, pal.
Let it go.

29:06.870 --> 29:08.201
Let it go.

29:08.240 --> 29:09.173
(Snarling)

29:14.880 --> 29:16.348
(Yelps)

29:19.920 --> 29:21.911
- Aidan, Aidan...

29:23.060 --> 29:23.959
Aidan...

29:23.990 --> 29:26.721
I've lost so much blood.

29:26.760 --> 29:28.558
Is my body gonna heal?

29:35.870 --> 29:37.804
(Growling)

29:39.810 --> 29:42.802
- We're all right.
We're OK.

29:42.840 --> 29:45.241
There is a way
out of this.

29:52.550 --> 29:54.712
- The bullets
are in the shed.

29:58.260 --> 30:00.058
- Come on, come on.

30:00.090 --> 30:01.319
(Groans)

30:04.970 --> 30:07.268
- I'll just
slow you down.

30:07.300 --> 30:09.189
You know what
you have to do.

30:09.240 --> 30:11.299
- (Aidan): No.

30:13.270 --> 30:17.275
- Please.
Or we'll both die.

30:22.350 --> 30:24.546
Run, Aidan.

30:24.590 --> 30:26.684
Go, go.

30:31.830 --> 30:33.855
(Screaming)

30:38.370 --> 30:40.361
(Crickets chirping)

30:47.110 --> 30:48.373
- Oh...

30:48.410 --> 30:51.380
Have you just been
waiting for me?

30:51.410 --> 30:53.139
- You came to me.

30:53.180 --> 30:55.069
I knew you would.

31:00.960 --> 31:03.452
- I've been thinking
about what you said.

31:03.490 --> 31:06.357
And I want you to know
that you're wrong about me.

31:06.390 --> 31:08.199
I'm not special.

31:08.230 --> 31:09.994
- What are you then?

31:10.030 --> 31:11.828
- I'm miserable.

31:14.970 --> 31:17.234
When I was alive...

31:18.010 --> 31:20.160
it never even
entered my mind

31:20.210 --> 31:24.101
that I could exist on
another plane when I died

31:24.150 --> 31:27.404
and watch everyone
move on without me...

31:29.480 --> 31:31.642
and eventually
forget me.

31:32.490 --> 31:35.380
When I met my roommates,
I thought:

31:35.420 --> 31:40.119
"This is amazing.
It's easier now.

31:40.160 --> 31:42.322
"We're in this together."

31:43.400 --> 31:46.859
But then they moved on
without me too.

31:48.200 --> 31:50.294
Everybody else has...

31:51.140 --> 31:53.632
something else
to think about...

31:54.580 --> 31:56.309
somebody else to be with.

31:56.340 --> 31:58.650
And I have nothing.

32:02.350 --> 32:05.047
So maybe it's time
to stop running.

32:09.120 --> 32:11.680
What's it like
getting reaped?

32:14.160 --> 32:15.821
Where do you go?

32:15.860 --> 32:17.965
- You don't go.

32:19.330 --> 32:20.968
It just ends.

32:25.070 --> 32:27.368
It's almost dawn.

32:28.310 --> 32:31.803
New day,
new quota to fill.

32:34.550 --> 32:36.541
This has been nice.

32:37.850 --> 32:40.842
But pleasantries don't
balance the universe.

32:42.290 --> 32:44.384
I have to
take someone.

32:45.990 --> 32:47.924
Make your arrangements.

33:00.010 --> 33:02.229
(Birds chirping)

33:05.650 --> 33:09.018
** How quickly it unfolds

33:10.580 --> 33:13.845
* How far we fall

33:15.560 --> 33:18.188
* Does it ever just

33:18.230 --> 33:21.154
* Work out all right?

33:23.800 --> 33:26.997
* Buried inside

33:33.410 --> 33:36.436
* Sinking like stone

33:44.150 --> 33:47.541
* Forget who I am

33:53.960 --> 33:56.600
* Drifting away...

33:57.530 --> 33:59.259
- Oh God!

34:01.570 --> 34:03.095
Are you--

34:09.239 --> 34:11.208
What did we do?

34:12.980 --> 34:15.039
- It wasn't Aidan.

34:16.250 --> 34:18.184
I remember that much.

34:20.719 --> 34:21.915
- Who...

34:23.590 --> 34:25.149
Wh--what was it?

34:26.659 --> 34:27.821
- Does it matter?

34:30.199 --> 34:31.793
Whatever it was is dead.

34:37.270 --> 34:38.760
- What else
do you remember?

34:44.010 --> 34:46.069
- You tried to save me.

34:48.520 --> 34:49.976
- Uh...

34:50.020 --> 34:51.818
All I've ever done...

34:54.159 --> 34:57.653
all I've ever wanted
to do is protect you.

35:00.790 --> 35:03.691
- I feel horrible
the morning after a turn.

35:10.670 --> 35:12.399
- It gets easier,

35:13.140 --> 35:14.539
the pain.

35:15.540 --> 35:16.769
It dissipates with time

35:16.810 --> 35:18.699
as your body gets
used to the change.

35:18.750 --> 35:20.479
- No, Josh.

35:21.820 --> 35:24.687
I feel horrible because
I'm no longer a wolf.

35:28.620 --> 35:29.758
I wasn't hiding
on the Cape

35:29.790 --> 35:32.555
because I was afraid
of what I did to Will.

35:34.760 --> 35:38.390
I was hiding from the fact
that I didn't feel any remorse.

35:41.800 --> 35:43.689
- Nora...

35:43.740 --> 35:45.538
- You tried to
kill your pack.

35:47.410 --> 35:49.538
And part of me is
having a hard time

35:49.580 --> 35:50.775
forgiving you for that.

35:52.410 --> 35:55.345
But there's also
a part of me that,

35:55.380 --> 35:57.371
in some sick way,

35:57.420 --> 35:59.582
is almost proud, Josh.

36:00.850 --> 36:02.181
For one small moment,

36:02.220 --> 36:04.826
you gave in to
your natural urge.

36:04.860 --> 36:06.749
You gave in to the wolf.

36:08.760 --> 36:10.751
- Would you listen
to yourself?

36:10.800 --> 36:13.770
You're talking about
packs and urges?

36:13.800 --> 36:15.438
- That's my reality, Josh.

36:16.200 --> 36:17.292
And it's yours too.

36:17.340 --> 36:19.707
- But it doesn't
have to be this way.

36:19.740 --> 36:21.162
- Our relationship began

36:21.210 --> 36:23.633
because you wanted
to feel more human.

36:24.680 --> 36:26.603
You wanted to be human.

36:27.480 --> 36:29.710
And that's the difference
between us.

36:32.490 --> 36:34.618
You wanna be human...

36:36.860 --> 36:38.726
and I don't think I do.

36:41.400 --> 36:43.391
- So you'd give up on us?

36:45.400 --> 36:50.133
You'd really give up
on us after all this?

36:50.170 --> 36:52.730
- Josh, that night
in the woods,

36:52.770 --> 36:55.705
the first time I turned,

36:55.740 --> 36:58.300
maybe I saved your life...

36:59.810 --> 37:02.120
but I was saved too.

37:03.180 --> 37:04.818
(Sighs)

37:06.190 --> 37:08.284
Where are you going?

37:09.390 --> 37:11.484
We can do this
together, Josh.

37:14.460 --> 37:17.259
- I'm gonna go get my stuff
out of the shed.

37:17.300 --> 37:19.519
And then I'm gonna
get out of the woods.

37:19.570 --> 37:23.438
And then I'm gonna forget
this night ever happened.

37:23.470 --> 37:27.634
* Oh, and I forget who I am

37:33.710 --> 37:36.714
* Forget who I am *

37:54.500 --> 37:55.797
(Connor laughing)

37:55.840 --> 37:57.695
- What a game!
Am I right, hmm?

37:58.940 --> 38:00.908
I gotta say, I'm surprised
to see the two of you standing.

38:00.940 --> 38:03.272
I mean, Nora I wasn't
too worried about.

38:03.310 --> 38:06.109
But, Josh, you're scrappier
than I thought, man.

38:06.150 --> 38:07.447
Respect.

38:08.680 --> 38:09.579
And you!

38:09.620 --> 38:10.439
(Chuckles)

38:10.480 --> 38:11.811
You were a worthy
opponent, Cochise.

38:11.850 --> 38:13.409
I mean, this guy,
he really took the--

38:14.890 --> 38:17.188
(Nora gasps)

38:17.220 --> 38:19.427
- No! No!

38:19.460 --> 38:22.350
No! No!

38:22.400 --> 38:24.562
(Brynn screaming)

38:27.270 --> 38:29.193
- One more.

38:31.170 --> 38:32.467
(Groaning)

38:32.510 --> 38:33.762
Leave Boston now.

38:35.810 --> 38:37.699
(Crying)

38:39.280 --> 38:40.509
(Brynn screaming)

38:47.850 --> 38:49.215
- (Brynn): No!

39:03.640 --> 39:07.838
** I'm not too comfortable

39:08.840 --> 39:12.640
* To fall from the start

39:15.450 --> 39:20.286
* In these broken songs

39:21.390 --> 39:24.690
* Like you said I should

39:27.430 --> 39:31.219
* Like you understood...

39:34.070 --> 39:35.037
- You survived, brother.

39:35.070 --> 39:36.731
- No thanks to you.

39:38.940 --> 39:41.705
Bring this home with you.
Tell whatever story you want.

39:41.740 --> 39:44.903
You killed the wolf that killed
Hegeman. Call yourself a hero.

39:44.950 --> 39:47.874
I don't care, 'cause
your business here is done!

39:49.480 --> 39:53.439
* I'm not too comfortable

39:54.460 --> 39:57.760
* To fall from the start...

40:00.590 --> 40:02.524
- Remember that time...

40:03.800 --> 40:05.529
(Sighs)

40:06.630 --> 40:10.430
I never thought that I could
find friends like you.

40:10.470 --> 40:11.631
(Sighs)

40:11.670 --> 40:15.277
You guys are like my family.

40:16.510 --> 40:18.478
Ugh! Vomit!

40:18.510 --> 40:19.909
(Door closing)

40:19.950 --> 40:22.772
* Singing broken songs...

40:22.820 --> 40:24.845
(Sighs)

40:24.890 --> 40:27.484
* Like you said I should...

40:30.190 --> 40:31.316
- I never came back for you.

40:33.660 --> 40:35.651
Sally, I'm sorry.

40:35.700 --> 40:36.428
Are you OK?

40:37.230 --> 40:38.322
(Door closing)

40:38.360 --> 40:38.929
- Are you?

40:39.870 --> 40:41.292
- Just a long night.

41:00.490 --> 41:03.949
* But I'll build a home

41:06.490 --> 41:10.700
* In these broken songs

41:12.430 --> 41:15.968
* Like you said I should

41:18.970 --> 41:21.769
* Like you understood

41:29.520 --> 41:31.010
- Goodbye.

41:33.490 --> 41:37.449
* I'm not too comfortable...

41:37.490 --> 41:38.889
I'm ready.

41:38.930 --> 41:41.922
* To fall from the start *

41:46.070 --> 41:49.893
[ * * ]
