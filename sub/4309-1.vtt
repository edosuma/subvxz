00:29.003 --> 00:30.270
Danny?

00:34.342 --> 00:35.609
Wake up, partner.

00:39.981 --> 00:41.748
Man, you better wake up.

00:41.783 --> 00:44.484
Sleep your life away.

00:47.522 --> 00:50.757
Wake up, bitch!

00:50.792 --> 00:52.826
Kerwin?

00:52.860 --> 00:55.929
Changed their minds, I guess.

00:55.963 --> 00:58.932
What?

00:58.966 --> 01:03.036
Ain't that some shit.

01:03.070 --> 01:04.638
Where my stuff, man?

01:04.672 --> 01:07.207
Um, they...

01:07.241 --> 01:09.709
Well, they took it
right after you...

01:12.380 --> 01:13.480
you left.

01:13.514 --> 01:15.482
That's cold.

01:19.253 --> 01:21.354
Where is everybody?

01:21.389 --> 01:23.757
I'm not sure.

01:29.030 --> 01:30.964
They didn't even lock my door.

01:30.998 --> 01:33.867
How'd you get back here, buddy?

01:35.770 --> 01:36.903
Just came back.

01:36.938 --> 01:39.039
Where else
was I supposed to go?

01:53.120 --> 01:55.322
Kerwin?

01:55.356 --> 02:00.160
When I did that drive-by,
you know...

02:00.194 --> 02:03.597
Yeah.

02:03.631 --> 02:07.534
Shot up that dude, Carl,
with that 9-mil 'cause...

02:09.971 --> 02:12.772
I can't even remember now
exactly why I did it.

02:14.308 --> 02:15.909
Ain't that some shit?

02:17.712 --> 02:20.080
Anyway...

02:20.114 --> 02:23.283
I never saw
that little girl in there.

02:23.317 --> 02:26.086
One of them little car seats.

02:26.120 --> 02:29.022
Down low.

02:29.056 --> 02:31.458
Never even saw her, dude.

02:31.492 --> 02:38.098
Got that feeling...
that's where I'm going next.

02:38.132 --> 02:40.634
Where's that?

02:40.668 --> 02:43.236
To see her.

02:43.271 --> 02:44.604
Face her, I guess.

02:44.639 --> 02:47.908
Not looking forward to it,
I can tell you that.

02:50.278 --> 02:53.780
What do you say
to a little girl who you...

02:57.184 --> 02:59.586
What do you say?

03:00.821 --> 03:02.722
Maybe you just let her know

03:02.757 --> 03:06.726
who you-- who you are now,
Kerwin, who you've become.

03:06.761 --> 03:08.395
That's the thing, dude.

03:08.429 --> 03:12.432
It's getting hard
to remember who I am.

03:12.466 --> 03:15.468
More vague by the minute.

03:15.503 --> 03:18.672
You're a beautiful person,
Kerwin.

03:18.706 --> 03:20.941
That's all
you have to remember.

03:20.975 --> 03:23.109
I like that.

03:23.144 --> 03:27.614
Thanks, partner.

03:27.648 --> 03:29.683
Sure.

03:34.388 --> 03:37.157
Let's-- let's skip
the goodbyes on this one.

03:37.191 --> 03:38.692
Okay.

03:38.726 --> 03:42.929
Seriously, though, man,
you better wake up.

03:42.964 --> 03:44.130
Why?

03:44.165 --> 03:45.632
- Why?
- What does it matter?

03:45.666 --> 03:48.668
It matters 'cause you got
a chance to live, Danny.

03:48.703 --> 03:50.704
So I'm living.

03:50.738 --> 03:53.039
You look at life
like it's a burden.

03:53.074 --> 03:57.610
Life is a gift, man.
It's a gift.

03:57.645 --> 03:59.679
You better take that
with you, too.

04:01.749 --> 04:04.451
Take it where, Kerwin?

04:06.821 --> 04:09.656
Take it where?

04:15.196 --> 04:16.997
They finally did it.

04:17.031 --> 04:18.565
Amantha.

04:18.599 --> 04:21.500
Look at him, mom.
He might as well be dead.

04:21.535 --> 04:22.836
I mean it.

04:22.870 --> 04:24.237
The doctors had
to put him in a coma

04:24.271 --> 04:25.638
just to keep his brain--

04:25.673 --> 04:27.741
Amantha, stop.

04:29.343 --> 04:31.077
I'm getting a gun.

04:31.112 --> 04:34.547
I swear to God.
Just kill them all.

04:34.582 --> 04:37.250
Who would you start with?

04:37.284 --> 04:39.419
Oh, I don't know.

04:39.453 --> 04:41.388
Probably Judy Dean, the bitch.

04:43.057 --> 04:44.991
- What the hell?
- Daniel. Nurse!

04:45.026 --> 04:47.560
- Nurse! He's waking up!
- Nurse!

04:47.595 --> 04:48.728
It's okay, Daniel.

04:48.763 --> 04:50.330
Oh, my God.
He's waking up.

04:50.364 --> 04:51.731
Well, we all agree
he's waking up!

04:51.766 --> 04:52.899
- How?
- I don't know.

04:52.933 --> 04:54.234
You got to be kidding me!

04:54.268 --> 04:55.735
It's okay, sir.
You're in the hospital.

04:55.770 --> 04:57.237
We're gonna give you something
to help you sleep.

04:57.271 --> 04:58.838
Nurse Miley.

04:58.873 --> 05:00.573
Got it.

05:00.608 --> 05:02.442
You don't have to fight.
You don't have to fight anymore!

05:03.210 --> 05:05.278
- Ma'am, please.
- Please what? Let him rip his tubes out?

05:05.312 --> 05:07.914
Let us do our job, ma'am.

05:10.918 --> 05:12.732
It's okay.
Just calm down.

05:12.733 --> 05:13.733
It's okay Daniel.

05:13.788 --> 05:16.222
It's okay, honey.

05:16.257 --> 05:17.690
It's okay, Daniel.

05:17.725 --> 05:20.827
- It's okay, sweetheart.
- Just try and relax.

05:27.301 --> 05:29.102
I'm sorry, Danny.

05:31.505 --> 05:34.908
I'm sorry you have
to go through this.

05:34.942 --> 05:36.209
We'll be here, honey.

05:36.243 --> 05:38.311
We'll be here
when you come back.

06:12.980 --> 06:16.983
Hey, you know why EMTs
are so fat?

06:17.017 --> 06:20.019
I don't know, Lid.
Why?

06:20.054 --> 06:21.921
Because they wait around
all day

06:21.956 --> 06:23.756
and then they drive everywhere.

06:23.791 --> 06:25.125
In this case, they drove

06:25.159 --> 06:28.194
all over the suspect's
tire tracks.

06:28.229 --> 06:30.997
And they parked 20 feet away
and walked to the crime scene.

06:31.031 --> 06:32.966
Lucky for you, though, huh?

06:33.000 --> 06:36.136
How's that?

06:36.170 --> 06:38.605
Need me to tell you?

06:41.175 --> 06:43.543
So, what did the witness say?

06:43.577 --> 06:46.045
Saw a blue truck drive out
the back exit of the cemetery.

06:46.080 --> 06:47.680
She ID anybody?

06:47.715 --> 06:51.117
Nah. Said the truck
was too far away.

06:51.152 --> 06:54.120
Uh, something a little odd,
though.

06:54.155 --> 06:57.123
She said if she had to guess
who the men were,

06:57.158 --> 06:58.791
she'd say they were black.

06:58.826 --> 07:03.062
Well,
she said African-American.

07:03.097 --> 07:04.697
Yeah. I know.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.469
Keep a guy here for the night.

07:09.503 --> 07:11.771
The weather holds, we'll be able
to see better in the morning.

07:17.044 --> 07:18.978
Hey, you moving on
or something?

07:19.013 --> 07:20.513
What?

07:20.548 --> 07:22.849
You know,
different line of work?

07:22.883 --> 07:26.019
'Cause if you catch these guys,
let alone convict them,

07:26.053 --> 07:30.924
your re-election chances...
are toast.

07:33.961 --> 07:37.530
Got to do my job, Lid.

07:37.565 --> 07:40.733
What job is that, Carl?

07:40.768 --> 07:42.769
Putting guys in jail for beating
the hell out of a man

07:42.803 --> 07:43.970
who should already be dead?

07:47.608 --> 07:49.175
Can you believe that?

07:49.210 --> 07:50.944
They didn't even know
how much medication to use

07:50.978 --> 07:52.579
to keep him in a friggin' coma.

07:52.613 --> 07:55.248
I'm gonna get some coffee
and then I'll spell Ted.

07:55.282 --> 07:57.116
Isn't that, like,
brain doctoring 101?

07:57.151 --> 07:59.519
Speaking of which, the doctor
doesn't even show up

07:59.553 --> 08:01.788
until 30 minutes after
Daniel's back down under.

08:01.822 --> 08:04.057
Unbelievable!

08:04.091 --> 08:06.426
Mama, why don't you go home
with Ted? I'll stay the night.

08:06.460 --> 08:09.195
No. He's my son, and I'm not
leaving him, not tonight.

08:09.230 --> 08:10.697
- You go home.
- Mama.

08:10.731 --> 08:12.865
I'm not leaving him, Amantha.

08:12.900 --> 08:15.602
They don't have anybody guarding
the door, Daggett Maggot.

08:15.636 --> 08:17.770
- Nobody's gonna come to Atlanta.
- Promise?

08:17.805 --> 08:20.740
Our only hope is they're too
stupid to access Google Maps.

08:20.774 --> 08:23.710
Hi.

08:25.079 --> 08:26.713
How is he?

08:26.747 --> 08:28.248
Not good.
Thanks for asking.

08:30.084 --> 08:32.284
Is there anything I can do?

08:32.318 --> 08:34.921
Wouldn't be a brain surgeon,
by chance?

08:34.955 --> 08:36.956
Where's Teddy?

08:36.991 --> 08:39.424
Um, he didn't want
to upset anyone by coming,

08:39.460 --> 08:42.495
so he thought it might be better
if he stayed home tonight.

08:42.529 --> 08:44.964
If Teddy wants to be here,
he should be here.

08:44.999 --> 08:46.899
Right, Amantha?

08:46.934 --> 08:48.968
Seriously doubt
he wants to be here.

08:49.003 --> 08:51.271
But of course, mother.

08:52.339 --> 08:55.108
You mean well, don't you?

08:55.142 --> 08:58.278
I do mean well, Janet.

09:00.447 --> 09:02.448
I have to go relieve Ted.

09:04.218 --> 09:05.952
May I, um...

09:05.986 --> 09:07.654
Yes?

09:07.688 --> 09:10.023
May I see Daniel
for a few minutes?

09:11.458 --> 09:13.793
I'd like to be alone with him.

09:13.827 --> 09:15.161
Of course.

09:15.195 --> 09:17.630
But in a little while, yes.

09:17.665 --> 09:19.399
Thank you.

09:27.975 --> 09:30.977
At least he's been washed
in the blood,

09:31.011 --> 09:35.281
literally and figuratively now.

09:35.316 --> 09:36.549
So, worst-case scenario,

09:36.583 --> 09:38.384
he goes straight to Heaven,
right?

09:38.419 --> 09:42.322
That is what I believe, yes.

09:42.356 --> 09:45.058
And he can spend eternity
listening to--

09:45.092 --> 09:49.729
oh, I don't know-- country
music with a gospel twist?

09:49.763 --> 09:52.198
I'm sure show tunes are out.

09:53.334 --> 09:55.501
I don't know about music.

09:59.239 --> 10:02.508
I'm just...

10:04.078 --> 10:08.014
so sorry.

10:08.048 --> 10:10.683
Sorry for what, Tawney?

10:10.718 --> 10:11.984
I'm just sorry

10:12.019 --> 10:13.786
for everything
that's happened to him.

10:16.223 --> 10:19.592
I'm so, so sorry.

10:25.132 --> 10:30.703
Well... we all are.

10:32.106 --> 10:33.740
Sorry.

10:33.774 --> 10:38.111
Thank you.

10:38.145 --> 10:39.612
I just don't understand

10:39.646 --> 10:41.280
why God would let something
like this happen to him.

10:42.916 --> 10:47.920
I mean, to anyone, but...
especially to him.

10:47.955 --> 10:51.958
He suffered so much already.

10:51.992 --> 10:56.362
I mean, I know it's always
a question, but...

10:56.397 --> 10:58.297
It's always the question.

10:58.332 --> 11:00.967
It's one of the big ones.

11:01.001 --> 11:03.069
And they say we...

11:04.471 --> 11:08.408
we can't... know
God's intention sometimes,

11:08.442 --> 11:12.145
that-- that it's too big for
a human to understand, but...

11:12.179 --> 11:14.981
I sure don't understand this,

11:15.015 --> 11:18.384
and I don't see how
I ever will.

11:21.855 --> 11:25.558
I don't think God plans things
like this, Tawney.

11:25.592 --> 11:29.295
I mean,
why would somebody do that?

11:29.329 --> 11:30.830
Especially a God, you know,

11:30.864 --> 11:34.333
if they had that
kind of power, and...

11:34.368 --> 11:36.969
why would you even want
to hang out with that--

11:37.004 --> 11:38.771
that God-- you know?

11:40.040 --> 11:42.642
Much less worship him,
really, so...

11:42.676 --> 11:44.477
I just have to believe

11:44.511 --> 11:46.779
that it's all some cosmic
cause and effect

11:46.814 --> 11:53.152
or just plain... random.

11:54.988 --> 11:56.823
Do you believe in God?

11:59.460 --> 12:02.528
Well, I believe in evil,
so, uh...

12:04.131 --> 12:05.731
I don't really want to talk
about it.

12:09.236 --> 12:12.004
Excuse me while I go and smoke
a carton of cigarettes.

12:21.081 --> 12:23.783
This complicates things.

12:23.817 --> 12:26.385
Yep.

12:26.420 --> 12:28.521
If they'd just gone on
and killed him,

12:28.555 --> 12:31.290
I could've started focusing
on my run for governor.

12:31.325 --> 12:34.494
And you could be back
to busting potheads.

12:38.332 --> 12:40.032
So they took him up to Atlanta?

12:40.067 --> 12:42.001
Yeah.

12:42.035 --> 12:45.872
Paulie Hospital's not real big
on brain surgery.

12:45.906 --> 12:47.540
They gonna cut on him?

12:47.574 --> 12:50.810
I don't know.
They put him in a coma.

12:50.844 --> 12:52.411
That can't be good.

12:52.446 --> 12:55.348
Did he say anything
before they put him down?

12:55.382 --> 13:00.052
No.
He wasn't responsive at all.

13:00.087 --> 13:02.722
Well, this could be
the worst outcome, really.

13:02.756 --> 13:04.257
How's that?

13:04.291 --> 13:06.192
Well, if he survives
and he's brain-damaged,

13:06.226 --> 13:08.661
try going up against that
in a courtroom.

13:08.695 --> 13:12.498
Nothing more effective
than a well-timed drool.

13:12.533 --> 13:15.434
Regardless of what happens
to Holden,

13:15.469 --> 13:18.104
I'm gonna find out
who did this.

13:21.308 --> 13:24.410
I'm surprised you ain't gonna
try and talk me out of it.

13:24.444 --> 13:28.447
I would never dissuade a man
from doing honest work.

13:30.817 --> 13:34.787
You make sure you lay off
of Holden for the time being.

13:34.821 --> 13:37.223
Sure way to lose
the PR battle--

13:37.257 --> 13:40.226
kick a man while he's down,
as it were.

13:42.663 --> 13:46.732
That's what makes life
so... interesting

13:46.767 --> 13:48.267
and confounding.

13:48.302 --> 13:50.202
What's that?

13:50.237 --> 13:54.407
Variables, Sheriff.

13:54.441 --> 13:56.008
Variables.

14:03.283 --> 14:06.719
<i>Just seven days after</i>
<i>his release from death row,</i>

14:06.753 --> 14:10.156
<i>Paulie resident Daniel Holden</i>
<i>was discovered severely beaten</i>

14:10.190 --> 14:12.425
<i>here at the Paulie Knoll</i>
<i>cemetery.</i>

14:14.428 --> 14:17.430
You got wet.

14:17.464 --> 14:19.332
It's raining.

14:19.366 --> 14:21.968
<i>Holden, as you may recall,</i>
<i>was convicted of the 1994 rape</i>

14:22.002 --> 14:23.970
<i>and murder of his girlfriend,</i>
<i>Hanna Dean,</i>

14:24.004 --> 14:26.105
<i>a conviction that was vacated</i>
<i>just last week.</i>

14:26.139 --> 14:28.674
You want some dinner?

14:28.709 --> 14:31.310
I fixed you some.

14:31.345 --> 14:34.080
<i>- Now details are still...</i>
- Sure.

14:34.114 --> 14:36.682
<i>It appears Holden may have been</i>
<i>visiting Hanna Dean's grave</i>

14:36.717 --> 14:38.751
<i>here at the cemetery</i>
<i>when he was attacked.</i>

14:38.785 --> 14:40.353
<i>The Sheriff's Department</i>
<i>confirms</i>

14:40.387 --> 14:42.154
<i>that they are</i>
<i>interviewing witnesses</i>

14:42.189 --> 14:44.690

14:44.725 --> 14:46.325
<i>Their spokesperson says</i>

14:46.360 --> 14:48.127
<i>it isn't surprising</i>
<i>in a case this early...</i>

14:48.161 --> 14:50.129
I love you, baby.

14:50.163 --> 14:53.032
<i>Reporting from Paulie.</i>
<i>Back to you, Laura.</i>

14:55.035 --> 14:57.470
Baby?

14:57.504 --> 14:59.005
I heard you.

15:15.756 --> 15:19.058
Daniel made quite an impression
on you, didn't he?

15:21.194 --> 15:23.462
He did.

15:23.497 --> 15:26.232
You see some of what I do
in him.

15:26.266 --> 15:29.869
Yes, ma'am.

15:32.105 --> 15:35.441
I'm gonna give you a little time
with him.

15:37.844 --> 15:39.578
Y-you don't have to do that
on my account.

15:39.613 --> 15:41.714
No, I-- I want you to.

15:44.051 --> 15:46.185
Tawney...

15:46.219 --> 15:50.022
could you pray over him?

15:50.057 --> 15:54.026
Yes. I-- I could.

15:54.061 --> 15:56.162
I sure could.

15:56.196 --> 15:58.764
Can't hurt, right?

16:09.576 --> 16:10.743
Tawney...

16:12.479 --> 16:16.449
I know Teddy isn't the most
polished person in the world.

16:16.483 --> 16:21.053
I don't expect that to change,
to be honest.

16:22.923 --> 16:25.257
And he's never felt good
about himself.

16:26.927 --> 16:29.729
But I have hopes that
will change some in time.

16:29.763 --> 16:32.798
Yes, ma'am.

16:32.833 --> 16:35.501
But I do know this, Tawney.

16:37.270 --> 16:40.106
He loves you more than anything
in this world.

16:58.625 --> 17:00.493
Wake up, Danny Boy!

17:04.531 --> 17:05.798
Danny Boy!

17:05.832 --> 17:09.435
Hey!
What're you doing?!

17:10.704 --> 17:13.506
Wake up!
Wake up! Wake up!

17:13.540 --> 17:16.175
Shut up!
We're trying to sleep down here!

17:16.209 --> 17:17.443
Hey, shut up, you!

17:17.477 --> 17:18.611
Hey, you in there?

17:18.645 --> 17:20.146
I'm gambling that even you

17:20.180 --> 17:22.781
couldn't sleep through
that ape-clamor, huh?

17:22.816 --> 17:24.083
Huh?!

17:24.117 --> 17:28.420
Now look.
I'm not a psychiatrist.

17:28.454 --> 17:31.791
The Devil himself knows
I've talked to enough of them.

17:31.825 --> 17:35.694
By my calculations...

17:35.729 --> 17:38.497
you have been sleeping
like 18 hours a day

17:38.532 --> 17:40.800
since they put
your little buddy down.

17:40.834 --> 17:43.590
Now, it's not a stretch to say

17:43.624 --> 17:47.027
that you might be
clinically depressed.

17:47.061 --> 17:49.596
That's not something
to trifle with, Dan.

17:49.630 --> 17:53.800
Now, granted,
our options are limited.

17:53.834 --> 17:58.772
But there's still good
old-fashioned talk therapy.

17:58.806 --> 18:01.608
Tried and true.

18:01.642 --> 18:06.279
And believe it or not,
I'm a good listener.

18:06.314 --> 18:09.649
But I have a confession, Dan.

18:09.684 --> 18:13.486
I mean, if we're gonna have
a trusting, open,

18:13.521 --> 18:15.855
doctor-patient relationship...

18:17.925 --> 18:21.561
well, Dan...

18:21.596 --> 18:23.029
I'm one of the ones

18:23.064 --> 18:24.831
that buggered you in the shower
that time.

18:26.334 --> 18:28.835
Number four, I think it was.

18:30.271 --> 18:35.041
Some of them other boys
already choked you out.

18:35.076 --> 18:38.345
You were passed out,

18:38.379 --> 18:40.880
laying facedown on the floor
when it was my turn.

18:40.915 --> 18:43.883
I think you were still
unconscious, too.

18:45.086 --> 18:46.553
I can't be sure.

18:46.587 --> 18:50.490
I'm not gonna lie, say that
I didn't enjoy it, Dan.

18:52.426 --> 18:55.662
But it wasn't personal, Danny.

18:55.696 --> 18:58.932
Seriously.

18:58.966 --> 19:02.769
I mean, I didn't
really know you then.

19:05.039 --> 19:07.540
You was just
some teenaged punk.

19:09.110 --> 19:13.880
Could've been any other warm
booty, as far as I cared.

19:16.550 --> 19:21.121
It's just friction
and chemistry.

19:21.155 --> 19:24.391
I just wanted that tingly
feeling, you know?

19:24.425 --> 19:27.427
Could've been a watermelon.

19:27.461 --> 19:30.063
Well... maybe not.

19:30.097 --> 19:33.266
Youth does have its appeal.

20:29.073 --> 20:31.174
Hey.

20:31.208 --> 20:32.542
Damn, dad.

20:32.576 --> 20:33.810
What're you doing?

20:33.844 --> 20:36.179
Just waiting on coffee
to get made.

20:39.283 --> 20:41.584
You're here early.

20:41.618 --> 20:45.321
Yeah. Didn't sleep much
last night.

20:45.356 --> 20:46.522
What's up with the muffins?

20:46.557 --> 20:48.358
Oh. Some of our
younger customers

20:48.392 --> 20:49.892
like a healthier choice.

20:49.927 --> 20:52.862
Hmm. How about you?
You get any rest?

20:54.298 --> 20:57.934
Little bit.

20:57.968 --> 21:02.071
So, uh... Tawney said that,
uh, they have him stabilized,

21:02.106 --> 21:04.407
- so that's good.
- Mm-hmm.

21:06.477 --> 21:09.579
All right, dad, what's up?

21:09.613 --> 21:11.180
Janet was upset

21:11.215 --> 21:13.516
that you didn't come
by the hospital last night.

21:13.550 --> 21:16.419
Dad, Amantha can't stand to be
in the same room with me.

21:16.453 --> 21:17.754
All right?
I didn't want to go down there

21:17.788 --> 21:19.122
and start some kind of fight
or something.

21:19.156 --> 21:21.591
That's the last thing
mom needed.

21:21.625 --> 21:23.292
Right?

21:23.327 --> 21:25.695
You need to find out a way
not to fight with Amantha

21:25.729 --> 21:27.330
and be there
for your stepmother.

21:28.832 --> 21:30.900
It's more complicated
than that, dad.

21:30.934 --> 21:34.804
Well, maybe so, but right now,
it needs to be that simple.

21:42.946 --> 21:44.447
Hey, Carl.

21:44.481 --> 21:47.316
Teddy.
Your dad in?

21:47.351 --> 21:48.451
Yeah, he's in back.
What's up?

21:48.485 --> 21:49.952
Uh, nothing major to report.

21:49.987 --> 21:52.288
Just want to talk to your dad
for a minute.

21:52.322 --> 21:55.792
Yeah, let me go grab him.

21:57.461 --> 22:00.663
Listen, there's...
not a real good time

22:00.697 --> 22:02.832
to talk about this, but, uh...

22:02.866 --> 22:04.901
any decision yet on the bid?

22:04.935 --> 22:08.171
Well, it was a-- you know,

22:08.205 --> 22:10.440
it was a fair price on the tires
and all, but, uh...

22:10.474 --> 22:11.908
We didn't get it, did we?

22:11.942 --> 22:13.843
Sorry, Ted.

22:16.046 --> 22:17.547
Somebody beat our price?

22:19.817 --> 22:21.684
You know,
there were other factors

22:21.718 --> 22:24.253
to be taken in consideration
besides just price.

22:24.288 --> 22:27.156
I mean, ultimately, it's the
County Commissioner's decision.

22:27.191 --> 22:28.458
I see.

22:28.492 --> 22:30.426
Look, you know
if it'd been up to me...

22:30.461 --> 22:32.462
Oh, yeah, of course.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:32.496 --> 22:35.498
Just not a good time, Ted.
You know?

22:35.532 --> 22:38.768
Maybe next go-round,
when things settle down.

22:38.802 --> 22:42.972
Well, hey, I appreciate
the chance, Carl.

22:43.006 --> 22:44.307
I'm sorry, Ted.

22:44.341 --> 22:47.376
I know this all affects
the whole family

22:47.411 --> 22:50.513
in ways that y'all
have no control over.

22:50.547 --> 22:53.382
You don't know
the half of it, Carl.

22:53.417 --> 22:56.018
What do you mean?

23:00.224 --> 23:03.626
Nothing.
I'm gonna go get dad.

23:12.202 --> 23:16.539
Danny, thank you
for giving this to me.

23:19.009 --> 23:23.279
Is that why you left it
in my car?

23:32.890 --> 23:35.558
I'm gonna keep him in here
with you,

23:35.592 --> 23:38.060
let him watch over you.

23:42.232 --> 23:44.467
He makes me think of dad,
you know?

23:53.911 --> 23:56.379
Sorry to bother you,
but there's a visitor.

23:56.413 --> 23:58.948
Oh.
Okay. Uh...

23:58.982 --> 24:01.551
It's okay, Amantha.

24:01.585 --> 24:03.018
I'll stay here and watch
over him till you get back.

24:05.622 --> 24:07.823
Thank you.

24:15.065 --> 24:17.433
Oh.

24:17.467 --> 24:19.135
Hi.

24:19.169 --> 24:21.470
Hi.

24:22.839 --> 24:25.074
This is a bad time, isn't it?

24:25.108 --> 24:28.444
There's not a good time,
really.

24:28.478 --> 24:30.680
I see.

24:32.849 --> 24:34.217
No, wait.

24:34.251 --> 24:36.252
Melvin, I didn't mean
that you should go.

24:36.286 --> 24:38.287
It's-- it's just that,
well...

24:38.322 --> 24:41.457
Daniel's in a coma.

24:41.491 --> 24:44.994
A coma?

24:46.597 --> 24:48.831
Wow.

24:51.802 --> 24:54.337
But we're hopeful, Melvin.

24:54.371 --> 24:56.172
And Daniel's a fighter.

24:56.206 --> 24:57.673
Yeah.

24:57.708 --> 25:01.944
I, uh-- I figured he was.

25:01.979 --> 25:04.313
Your whole family's got to be
fighters, I guess.

25:04.348 --> 25:06.949
I don't know about that.

25:06.984 --> 25:08.784
Circumstances usually dictate.

25:08.819 --> 25:10.953
You're way too smart to be
in Paulie.

25:10.988 --> 25:12.788
What?

25:12.823 --> 25:14.257
You stay there too long,

25:14.291 --> 25:15.625
you do too much thinking
at the same time,

25:15.659 --> 25:17.093
it's bad
for your mental health.

25:17.127 --> 25:18.961
Good to know.
While I'm there,

25:18.996 --> 25:21.464
I'll keep thinking
to an absolute minimum.

25:23.066 --> 25:26.135
Is that for Daniel?

25:27.871 --> 25:31.107
Yeah. Um...

25:31.141 --> 25:34.010
Now, it-- it's not something
he can enjoy right now,

25:34.044 --> 25:36.646
but, um...
it'll-- it'll keep.

25:36.680 --> 25:39.849
Oh. That's good.

25:45.055 --> 25:47.523
It's a turtle.

25:47.557 --> 25:50.526
- Hmm?
- A chocolate turtle,

25:50.560 --> 25:52.862
not a--
not a real one, of course.

25:54.765 --> 25:57.466
You know, I thought maybe
a-- a turtle theme,

25:57.501 --> 26:00.569
like when we were kids, and...

26:00.604 --> 26:01.971
Mm.

26:02.005 --> 26:05.508
Sounds pretty stupid
when I say it out loud.

26:05.542 --> 26:09.011
No.
It's very thoughtful, Melvin.

26:09.046 --> 26:11.380
You don't want to leave that
in a car.

26:11.415 --> 26:12.715
The sun.

26:12.749 --> 26:14.016
I wouldn't think so.

26:14.051 --> 26:15.885
At room temperature,
it should be fine.

26:15.919 --> 26:18.087
Yeah, I'm sure
it's full of preservatives.

26:18.121 --> 26:19.488
Most things are these days.

26:19.523 --> 26:20.823
It's really hard

26:20.857 --> 26:23.893
to find chocolate products
without, uh...

26:23.927 --> 26:25.361
Anyway...

26:25.395 --> 26:27.063
I'll make sure Daniel
gets it when he...

26:33.036 --> 26:35.338
wakes up.

26:35.372 --> 26:38.274
Well...

26:38.308 --> 26:39.709
Yeah.

26:42.145 --> 26:46.716
Uh, I'm...
I'm glad you came, Melvin.

26:48.285 --> 26:53.089
I-- I debated... whether
or not I should, but, uh...

26:53.123 --> 26:56.292
regrets grow tiresome.

26:56.326 --> 26:58.461
I heard that.

26:58.495 --> 27:02.631
Well, I'm sure
it'll mean a lot to Daniel.

27:02.666 --> 27:05.267
It means a lot to me, too.

27:05.302 --> 27:06.435
Uh...

27:07.904 --> 27:09.405
Thank you, Melvin.

27:33.611 --> 27:36.079
That truck belongs
to Jake Johnson.

27:36.114 --> 27:39.049
And?

27:39.083 --> 27:42.619
He's a friend of Bobby Dean's.

27:42.653 --> 27:45.155
We could just go get lunch
and forget about it.

27:45.189 --> 27:48.158
Nobody'd blame you, Carl.

27:48.192 --> 27:50.594
Not that they'd ever find out.

28:02.807 --> 28:05.108
What's up?

28:05.143 --> 28:09.413
A woman saw you leaving
the cemetery, Jake.

28:09.447 --> 28:12.616
She ID'd you and your truck.

28:12.650 --> 28:15.385
And we know Bobby Dean
was there, too.

28:18.055 --> 28:21.425
It'd be best if you just
come clean right now.

28:21.459 --> 28:22.793
Best for you.

28:22.827 --> 28:25.595
I know this wasn't
your idea, Jake.

28:25.630 --> 28:29.399
There's no reason for you
to take the biggest fall.

28:30.902 --> 28:33.470
I wasn't there.

28:33.504 --> 28:36.139
You were ID'd, Jake.
Clear as day.

28:38.176 --> 28:40.210
Well...

28:40.244 --> 28:43.847
I guess you just need to go on
and arrest me, Sheriff.

28:43.881 --> 28:45.449
I ain't saying no more.

28:51.389 --> 28:54.591
No. I'm gonna give you a day
or two to think about it.

28:59.997 --> 29:01.798
Oh, uh...

29:01.833 --> 29:03.166
you don't mind

29:03.201 --> 29:05.368
if we take a few photos
of your tires, do you?

29:05.403 --> 29:08.472
Since you weren't there
and all.

29:08.506 --> 29:09.773
I guess not.

29:13.678 --> 29:18.348
Hey, Carl, you reckon
they wore masks?

29:20.218 --> 29:22.319
For the beating?

29:22.353 --> 29:26.857
I mean, if they didn't intend
to kill him...

29:28.392 --> 29:29.893
they wouldn't want to get
recognized, either.

29:29.927 --> 29:31.728
Could have.

29:33.731 --> 29:35.999
And, uh, I was thinking...

29:36.033 --> 29:40.203
if they were wearing masks
and they still had them on

29:40.238 --> 29:42.506
when they drove out
of the cemetery...

29:42.540 --> 29:45.575
Jake would know I was lying
about the ID on him.

29:45.610 --> 29:47.310
Son of a bitch.

29:51.816 --> 29:54.117
What about the boys
on the bicycles?

29:54.151 --> 29:55.585
The ones following
the ambulance.

29:55.620 --> 29:57.187
Yeah, I talked to their mamas.

29:57.221 --> 29:59.589
They both said their boys
didn't see anything.

30:00.725 --> 30:02.292
You didn't talk to the boys?

30:02.326 --> 30:04.194
No.

30:04.228 --> 30:07.631
Their mamas wouldn't let me.
What the hell was I gonna do?

30:24.515 --> 30:27.250
Can't come out here
dressed like that.

30:27.285 --> 30:29.219
But I want to be with you,
daddy.

30:29.253 --> 30:30.353
You want a spanking?

30:32.089 --> 30:33.924
Go back inside.

31:47.679 --> 31:50.915
You okay?

31:50.949 --> 31:53.584
Yeah.

31:55.654 --> 31:58.289
Everybody's sneaking up
on me today.

31:58.323 --> 31:59.557
I'm sorry.

31:59.591 --> 32:01.592
I didn't--
I didn't mean to.

32:01.626 --> 32:03.494
Oh, it's okay.
It's just...

32:08.800 --> 32:11.602
What-- what happened
to your neck?

32:14.005 --> 32:16.774
I don't know. I-I wrenched it
or something.

32:16.808 --> 32:19.643
How?

32:19.678 --> 32:24.042
Don't know. I woke up yesterday, and
it was stiff. Must have slept on it wrong.

32:25.717 --> 32:27.718
Well, do you want me
to rub on it?

32:31.323 --> 32:34.525
No, it's okay.
Thank you.

32:37.662 --> 32:40.297
Excuse me.

32:47.239 --> 32:48.906
Teddy, could you hold me?

32:52.177 --> 32:54.745
Yeah.

33:16.401 --> 33:18.068
What's wrong?

33:18.103 --> 33:19.837
Oh, nothing.

33:19.871 --> 33:21.171
You sure?

33:21.206 --> 33:23.340
Yeah, just got to get
to the hospital.

33:23.375 --> 33:25.476
Do you want me
to come with you?

33:25.510 --> 33:27.411
No. Not this time.

33:27.445 --> 33:30.381
I just want to be there
for mom, you know?

33:32.617 --> 33:33.884
Yeah, of course.

33:33.919 --> 33:35.552
All right.

33:42.127 --> 33:44.194
I need you to uncover
your window, Holden.

33:44.229 --> 33:47.932
I'm not gonna tell you again.

33:47.966 --> 33:49.733
I have a headache.

33:49.768 --> 33:51.869
I need you to uncover
your window

33:51.903 --> 33:54.571
and back up to the door
to be cuffed.

33:54.606 --> 33:57.541
- Holden.
- I have a headache.

33:57.575 --> 33:59.543
We're gonna send in
the Sert Unit

33:59.577 --> 34:01.845
to forcibly extract you
from your cell.

34:01.880 --> 34:04.381
I wish you wouldn't.

34:04.416 --> 34:07.551
You leave us no choice
if you refuse to cooperate.

34:07.585 --> 34:12.022
You know how this works.
This is your last chance.

34:12.056 --> 34:16.694
I repeat--
I have a headache,

34:16.728 --> 34:20.431
and I do not wish to be
disturbed at this time!

34:51.763 --> 34:57.434
Oh, thank you, sirs.
Can I have another?

35:03.174 --> 35:06.143
I'm still planning on redoing
the kitchen, you know?

35:06.177 --> 35:08.178
Don't think
this little setback's

35:08.213 --> 35:10.214
gonna get you out
of helping me.

35:13.085 --> 35:15.386
Hey.

35:15.420 --> 35:16.821
Uh, I'm gonna be
in the waiting area.

35:16.855 --> 35:18.222
Just want to let you know
I was here.

35:18.256 --> 35:19.957
- Come on in.
- Are you sure?

35:19.991 --> 35:22.460
I mean, aren't there rules
about this kind of thing?

35:22.494 --> 35:23.994
You're exempt.

35:26.098 --> 35:29.400
Come by me.
It'll be all right.

35:29.434 --> 35:31.035
Teddy's here to see you, buddy.

35:31.069 --> 35:32.403
Isn't that nice?

35:34.539 --> 35:35.973
How you holding up?

35:36.007 --> 35:38.776
Oh, me? I'm good.
I should be asking you.

35:41.012 --> 35:46.250
I've been in here...
thinking about so much.

35:46.284 --> 35:47.818
I bet.

35:47.853 --> 35:49.487
Including you.

35:49.521 --> 35:51.055
- Me?
- Mm.

35:51.089 --> 35:54.492
When Ted Sr. and you came
to the house the first time,

35:54.526 --> 35:56.861
before Ted and I got married,
do you remember that day?

35:56.895 --> 35:58.162
Yes, ma'am.

35:58.196 --> 36:00.431
You were in your Sunday suit.

36:00.465 --> 36:03.267
Didn't want to blow it for dad.

36:03.301 --> 36:05.402
I'd never seen such
a little gentleman before.

36:05.437 --> 36:06.937
Oh, I was on my best behavior.

36:08.373 --> 36:11.709
Amantha had on
some thrift-store dress.

36:11.743 --> 36:13.110
She was being all sullen

36:13.145 --> 36:15.379
and rolling her eyes
like a teenager.

36:15.413 --> 36:16.847
And it didn't bother you a bit.

36:16.882 --> 36:20.618
You just took it in stride,

36:20.652 --> 36:23.587
talking about football
and racecars.

36:25.257 --> 36:27.458
Yeah, I used to get real chatty
when I was nervous.

36:27.492 --> 36:29.960
I don't know.

36:29.995 --> 36:33.564
For a little while that day, I...

36:33.598 --> 36:36.901
I didn't think about
all the bad things, you know?

36:36.935 --> 36:41.806
I just...
saw this glimpse...

36:41.840 --> 36:45.142
this possibility of the future.

36:45.177 --> 36:46.544
Oh, it's okay.

36:46.578 --> 36:50.414
Teddy, I don't think
I could bear it if he...

36:52.383 --> 36:55.018
It's okay.

36:55.053 --> 36:58.455
Mom, you know if you need
anything, I'm here.

36:58.490 --> 37:00.624
You know that.

37:00.658 --> 37:02.960
I do know that.

37:06.898 --> 37:09.233
You probably just needed
a good cry.

37:09.267 --> 37:12.369
I guess.

37:12.403 --> 37:15.139
Oh, my.
I'm-- I'm gonna go freshen up.

37:15.173 --> 37:16.507
I'll be right back.

37:19.344 --> 37:20.811
Oh, should we get a nurse?

37:20.845 --> 37:22.479
Oh, don't worry.

37:22.514 --> 37:23.981
They'll come running
if any of the buzzers go off.

37:24.015 --> 37:25.582
Sit down.

37:25.617 --> 37:27.584
I know he's glad you're here.

37:27.619 --> 37:29.586
You'll be all right.

38:35.053 --> 38:36.653
What?

38:36.688 --> 38:39.823
You tell me, Teddy.

38:39.857 --> 38:42.826
Nothing.

39:00.264 --> 39:02.666
Now, how exactly
did we get here?

39:02.700 --> 39:06.770
I wished for you to see
this place, and here we are.

39:06.804 --> 39:09.606
Where'd all the leaves go,
though?

39:09.640 --> 39:12.409
They froze they ass off.

39:14.078 --> 39:15.578
Are those cows?

39:15.613 --> 39:18.581
Yes. Bovine.

39:18.616 --> 39:21.918
I guess there's a bull
around, too, huh?

39:21.953 --> 39:23.787
They're kind of necessary.

39:23.821 --> 39:26.423
Man, I mean, it's nice
and everything--

39:26.457 --> 39:28.024
you know, country life--

39:28.059 --> 39:29.926
but I grew up
on them streets, D.

39:31.228 --> 39:32.729
I'm not exactly a pig
in slop here.

39:32.763 --> 39:34.965
There's this statue
I wanted you to see.

39:34.999 --> 39:37.067
- Statue?
- Yeah.

39:40.972 --> 39:43.073
Her head's gone.

39:43.107 --> 39:45.241
Oh, man.
She a friend of yours?

39:45.276 --> 39:49.446
I had grown fond of her,
but she's lost her head.

39:55.453 --> 39:57.187
This ain't real, is it?

39:59.123 --> 40:04.260
Well, the place itself is,
but us being here...

40:04.295 --> 40:07.931
no. I'm actually
in a hospital...

40:07.965 --> 40:10.133
- in a coma.
- A coma?

40:10.167 --> 40:12.102
But I got out.

40:12.136 --> 40:14.304
Wait.
What you talking about?

40:14.338 --> 40:17.073
I got out, Kerwin.

40:17.108 --> 40:19.843
Out?
You mean off the row.

40:19.877 --> 40:21.511
Off the row.

40:21.545 --> 40:24.447
You got out alive?

40:24.482 --> 40:27.450
I did.

40:27.485 --> 40:28.918
Walked right out.

40:28.953 --> 40:32.322
Oh! I told you, D!
I told you!

40:32.356 --> 40:35.025
I told you! Whoo!

40:35.059 --> 40:38.128
That made me so happy, boy!
Made me so happy.

40:38.162 --> 40:39.929
Oh, man.

40:39.964 --> 40:44.000
Man, your sorry ass,
showing no optimism-- none.

40:44.035 --> 40:45.668
For years, none, zero,

40:45.703 --> 40:47.637
and here you are
in the natural world, man.

40:47.671 --> 40:50.373
Kickin' it with these
country-ass cows...

40:50.408 --> 40:52.709
runnin' with the bull.
That's it.

40:52.743 --> 40:54.277
That's a beautiful thing, D.

40:54.311 --> 40:56.446
When you put it that way...

40:56.480 --> 40:57.547
Wait.

40:57.581 --> 40:59.449
You say you in a coma?

40:59.483 --> 41:02.685
I fought the mob,
and the mob won.

41:02.720 --> 41:03.987
Oh, man.

41:04.021 --> 41:05.789
How long was you
off the row before...?

41:05.823 --> 41:07.457
Seven days.

41:07.491 --> 41:09.392
Oh, that ain't right, man.

41:09.427 --> 41:12.295
One week of freedom,
and now you're in a coma.

41:12.329 --> 41:14.864
Oh, but it was
the wildest week, Kerwin.

41:14.899 --> 41:18.334
I mean, every day
felt like a lifetime.

41:18.369 --> 41:20.837
- It was pretty overwhelming.
- I bet.

41:20.871 --> 41:25.075
I met this girl,
this-- this young woman.

41:26.343 --> 41:30.013
So beautiful.
Such light.

41:30.047 --> 41:31.581
That's wonderful, D.

41:31.615 --> 41:34.884
It was, yes.

41:34.919 --> 41:37.187
That's more the reason you got
to get out this coma, bro.

41:39.890 --> 41:44.561
You know, D, you might want
to get some glue for this thing.

41:44.595 --> 41:45.995
Them nasty-ass cows

41:46.030 --> 41:49.365
get to rubbing they behinds
against, and then...

41:49.400 --> 41:51.768
Good point.

41:54.105 --> 41:56.673
- Ah, man.
- Buddy?

41:56.707 --> 41:59.008
What?

41:59.043 --> 42:02.011
You're my best friend, Kerwin.

42:02.046 --> 42:04.347
My only friend, really.

42:04.381 --> 42:07.417
You'll make
more friends now, Danny.

42:07.451 --> 42:10.887
And I don't want
to let you down.

42:10.921 --> 42:12.889
Let me down?

42:12.923 --> 42:17.227
I just-- I don't think
I can do this.

42:19.663 --> 42:25.568
Everything out here...
it's just so complicated.

42:25.603 --> 42:29.973
There's so much pain
and-- and hate.

42:30.007 --> 42:33.376
And I think I may just be...

42:33.410 --> 42:35.478
just too broken, you know?

42:35.513 --> 42:37.947
Just too broken.

42:40.184 --> 42:43.486
One of the things that
kept me going on the row,

42:43.521 --> 42:45.788
maybe that thing was the hope

42:45.823 --> 42:48.391
that you'd get out
one day, Danny.

42:48.425 --> 42:50.727
But that was just me, you know?

42:50.761 --> 42:52.829
Me living through you.

42:52.863 --> 42:55.331
And I never felt envious
of you, not one time.

42:55.366 --> 42:58.067
I was just grateful to have
something to hope for,

42:58.102 --> 43:00.637
even if it was for the life
of another person.

43:00.671 --> 43:03.273
And you know, maybe
especially because of that.

43:03.307 --> 43:06.309
And when I realized that,

43:06.343 --> 43:10.346
when I became conscious of that
hope inside that 7x9 hellhole,

43:10.381 --> 43:13.183
I just thank God for it.

43:13.217 --> 43:14.851
Every day, Daniel.

43:14.885 --> 43:18.421
Every day.

43:18.455 --> 43:21.090
'Cause it gave me something
to live for. You feel me?

43:21.125 --> 43:23.359
I do.

43:23.394 --> 43:28.464
But now that's over with.
That time has passed.

43:28.499 --> 43:31.935
And I'm not of this world
now, so...

43:31.969 --> 43:34.871
This is your world.
And, uh...

43:34.905 --> 43:36.606
and you lying in a coma,

43:36.640 --> 43:39.175
and you can't deal
with it anymore?

43:39.210 --> 43:40.643
You just too tired,
and you--

43:40.678 --> 43:42.579
you ready to see
what's on the other side?

43:48.018 --> 43:49.786
Well, it's just not my place

43:49.820 --> 43:51.721
to tell you what to do,
brother.

43:51.755 --> 43:55.291
Just not my place.

43:55.326 --> 43:57.193
But whatever you decide...

44:00.231 --> 44:01.764
I'm still gonna love you, D.

44:04.034 --> 44:08.638
Always.
Forever and always.

44:08.672 --> 44:11.374
Thank you, Kerwin.

44:14.178 --> 44:16.412
I love you, too.

44:16.447 --> 44:18.214
I know.

44:23.687 --> 44:25.388
This is beautiful.

44:27.558 --> 44:31.060
You telling me you can come here
anytime you want?

44:31.095 --> 44:32.996
In theory.

44:33.030 --> 44:35.765
Yeah.
I don't know, D.

44:37.234 --> 44:39.869
Might be something to it.

44:39.903 --> 44:43.106
Yeah.

44:45.943 --> 44:48.278
All I'm sayin'.

44:48.312 --> 44:50.013
Yeah.

44:50.047 --> 44:52.515
All I'm sayin', D.

45:06.797 --> 45:09.265
All I'm sayin'.
