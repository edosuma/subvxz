00:16.703 --> 00:18.025
<i>Treachery in the Senate.</i>

00:18.469 --> 00:21.278
<i>The Jedi council suspects
that Senator Rush Clovis</i>

00:21.403 --> 00:24.503
<i>is secretly taking part
in a separatist conspiracy.</i>

00:25.295 --> 00:28.035
<i>But to find out what
the Senator from Scipio is up to,</i>

00:28.204 --> 00:30.704
<i>the council will need
a spy of its own.</i>

00:31.256 --> 00:35.041
<i>Meanwhile, Jedi Anakin Skywalker
has been away from Coruscant</i>

00:35.211 --> 00:38.004
<i>on a lengthy tour of duty
leading the clone army.</i>

00:38.173 --> 00:39.513
<i>Now Anakin returns</i>

00:39.638 --> 00:41.989
<i>for a long-awaited reunion
with his wife,</i>

00:42.114 --> 00:43.352
Padmé Amidala.

00:43.477 --> 00:46.164
Master Ani.
What a delight to see you.

00:46.462 --> 00:48.162
I shall tell mistress...

00:49.846 --> 00:51.517
That will be all, Threepio.

00:52.527 --> 00:54.198
Are you sure, my lady?

00:56.155 --> 00:56.981
Now go.

00:57.448 --> 00:58.773
Very well.

01:07.460 --> 01:09.141
I brought dinner.

01:10.016 --> 01:11.716
How did you manage this?

01:11.971 --> 01:14.671
I had to hitch a ride
on a cargo freighter.

01:14.900 --> 01:16.834
What happened
to your military transport?

01:18.472 --> 01:19.522
It blew up.

01:21.484 --> 01:24.425
Anyway, the captain was bringing
a shipment to a restaurant here,

01:24.715 --> 01:26.511
and he gave me something
to bring home.

01:26.897 --> 01:28.297
We just have to...

01:28.946 --> 01:31.821
- What?
- You called this "home."

01:32.513 --> 01:34.308
What else would I call it?

01:34.433 --> 01:36.267
The Naboo ambassador
gave me something.

01:36.392 --> 01:39.200
I think
I still have it here somewhere.

01:39.471 --> 01:41.798
- Must be something good.
- It is.

01:41.923 --> 01:45.802
It'll be perfect.
Five blossom bread, my specialty.

01:46.312 --> 01:48.073
You have a specialty?

01:48.414 --> 01:50.614
I know how to make lots of things.

01:50.826 --> 01:53.179
When I was little,
I cooked every day.

01:53.304 --> 01:55.706
I've been saving it
for a special occasion.

01:57.624 --> 01:59.424
An evening alone with you?

01:59.898 --> 02:02.548
I can't think
of an occasion more special.

02:10.630 --> 02:13.599
Involved with the Separatists,
the Banking Clan is.

02:13.768 --> 02:16.031
Discover the truth in this matter,
we must.

02:16.156 --> 02:18.020
I couldn't agree more, Master Yoda.

02:18.245 --> 02:20.929
But if Senator Amidala
has already refused to spy

02:21.054 --> 02:23.297
on Senator Clovis
of the banking delegation,

02:23.422 --> 02:25.611
I am not sure
how we can change her mind.

02:25.958 --> 02:28.531
That is why we asked you
to summon young Skywalker.

02:28.856 --> 02:31.156
I have been signaling him all night.

02:31.567 --> 02:33.617
I don't know where he could be.

02:38.683 --> 02:41.283
I wish it could always be
just like this.

02:41.601 --> 02:42.612
Me too.

02:48.267 --> 02:50.667
I have to report
to the Jedi Council.

02:50.827 --> 02:51.827
Right now?

02:52.520 --> 02:54.670
Actually, about seven clicks ago.

02:54.914 --> 02:58.350
If I keep delaying, Obi-Wan will send
a clone squad out to find me.

02:58.475 --> 03:00.396
I've been ducking
his signals all night.

03:02.221 --> 03:03.371
I understand.

03:03.957 --> 03:05.661
I can sense that you're angry.

03:05.786 --> 03:07.936
Don't think you can read my mind.

03:10.066 --> 03:14.070
You shouldn't take this personally.
Duty comes first, especially in wartime.

03:25.515 --> 03:28.048
Sorry I'm late.
What's going on?

03:28.218 --> 03:31.142
We believe Senator Clovis
is conspiring with the Separatists.

03:31.267 --> 03:32.970
We need to find out
what he's planning.

03:33.196 --> 03:34.805
Do you want me to interrogate him?

03:35.831 --> 03:38.267
Treat Senator Clovis as a criminal,
we should not.

03:38.436 --> 03:41.728
The slightest misstep
could cause a major incident.

03:41.898 --> 03:44.398
You feel if we provoke him,
we'll never find out what he's up to.

03:44.567 --> 03:45.457
Exactly.

03:45.582 --> 03:48.481
We need someone who's not a Jedi
to get close to him for us,

03:48.606 --> 03:50.112
someone he won't suspect.

03:50.281 --> 03:52.865
- If not a Jedi, who?
- A fellow Senator.

03:53.179 --> 03:55.284
Selected Senator Amidala, we have.

03:55.453 --> 03:57.453
You want her to spy on Clovis?

03:57.593 --> 03:59.178
I don't think that's a good idea.

03:59.303 --> 04:01.932
There has to be someone else
who's more qualified for this.

04:02.057 --> 04:03.511
We chose Senator Amidala

04:03.636 --> 04:06.533
because she and Clovis entered
the Senate in the same year.

04:06.658 --> 04:08.550
They served on the same committees.

04:08.675 --> 04:11.130
They were good friends.

04:11.255 --> 04:12.759
I didn't know that.

04:13.844 --> 04:16.269
Personal matters for the Senator,
these are.

04:16.394 --> 04:17.890
Know them, why would you?

04:18.059 --> 04:20.468
It's just that I wouldn't expect
Senator Amidala

04:20.593 --> 04:22.395
to have a friend
in the Banking Clan.

04:22.564 --> 04:25.941
Master Yoda has already asked her
to spy on Clovis for us.

04:26.066 --> 04:27.366
And she refused.

04:28.027 --> 04:30.077
Trust you, she does, Skywalker.

04:30.346 --> 04:32.646
That is why, convince her, you must.

04:46.309 --> 04:47.609
Senator Amidala.

04:48.022 --> 04:49.417
General Skywalker.

04:49.542 --> 04:51.699
You finally found some time for me.

04:51.824 --> 04:54.675
- Are you still mad about last night?
- Why would I be mad?

04:54.800 --> 04:56.478
- I'm not mad.
- Good.

04:57.079 --> 04:59.835
Now tell me about your dealings
with Senator Clovis.

04:59.960 --> 05:02.350
So you're here on Jedi business.

05:03.675 --> 05:05.354
I already told Master Yoda.

05:05.479 --> 05:09.184
I don't want to spy
on a colleague and an old friend.

05:09.309 --> 05:12.360
"Old friend."
How well do you know Clovis?

05:12.530 --> 05:14.070
Why does that matter?

05:14.195 --> 05:16.345
That was before we were together.

05:22.081 --> 05:24.795
I am just trying to get a sense
of who this guy is.

05:24.920 --> 05:27.334
I'll need to brief
whoever does end up spying on him.

05:28.381 --> 05:31.464
I thought you were here to talk me
into becoming an agent for the Jedi.

05:31.633 --> 05:33.433
That is not a job for you.

05:34.315 --> 05:36.045
I don't agree
with the council on this.

05:36.170 --> 05:38.189
If Clovis is involved
in a separatist conspiracy

05:38.314 --> 05:41.015
the last place you should be
is anywhere near him.

05:41.184 --> 05:43.501
Clovis is conspiring
with the Separatists?

05:43.626 --> 05:45.453
Yoda didn't tell me that.

05:45.877 --> 05:47.480
I can't believe
Clovis would do that.

05:48.164 --> 05:49.514
This is terrible.

05:49.869 --> 05:51.650
I never expected that from him.

05:53.511 --> 05:56.661
- Someone has to find out the truth.
- Someone does.

05:56.838 --> 05:57.907
Just not you.

06:00.192 --> 06:02.718
- Why not me?
- Because it's going to be dangerous.

06:02.843 --> 06:05.456
Whoever takes this mission
will be putting their life at risk.

06:05.625 --> 06:08.275
I've been in many tough situations
before.

06:08.499 --> 06:10.130
It never seemed to bother you.

06:10.255 --> 06:12.244
I never stopped you
from facing danger.

06:12.369 --> 06:15.267
- You're constantly getting shot at.
- I've been trained for that.

06:15.392 --> 06:17.676
It's very different
from spying on a traitor.

06:17.845 --> 06:20.512
You mean I can't handle the mission.

06:21.248 --> 06:25.148
- I mean I'm not gonna let you do it.
- You're not going to let me?

06:25.609 --> 06:27.659
It's not your decision to make.

06:27.843 --> 06:28.836
It's mine.

06:28.961 --> 06:31.690
Lucky for us,
you've already decided to refuse.

06:31.858 --> 06:34.550
Actually, I just changed my mind.

06:35.143 --> 06:38.156
You've convinced me that it's vital
to learn what Clovis is doing.

06:38.281 --> 06:40.407
I accept the mission to spy on him.

06:40.575 --> 06:44.270
- Even though I'm telling you not to?
- Don't take it personally, Anakin.

06:44.395 --> 06:47.873
Duty comes first,
especially in wartime.

06:54.072 --> 06:56.541
First, I'll need
to get back in touch with him.

06:56.666 --> 06:58.968
Clovis and I haven't spoken
in a long time.

06:59.136 --> 07:02.001
A surprise that is, given your past.

07:02.639 --> 07:06.976
- What does that mean, Senator?
- At one point, Clovis and I were close.

07:08.270 --> 07:11.882
It was my choice to return things
to a strictly professional level.

07:12.007 --> 07:13.649
Clovis didn't take it well.

07:13.817 --> 07:17.152
Do you think you'll be able
to rekindle your friendship with him?

07:17.320 --> 07:20.533
Master, Senator Clovis
is a very dangerous man.

07:20.884 --> 07:24.725
- If he realizes she's tricking him...
- I'm aware of the risks, Master Jedi.

07:24.850 --> 07:27.454
But I know
I can regain Clovis' trust.

07:27.622 --> 07:30.749
Good. The closer you can get to him,
the better.

07:30.917 --> 07:32.067
I understand.

07:32.607 --> 07:35.880
I'll do whatever is necessary
to succeed in my mission.

07:36.300 --> 07:39.150
And I'll do whatever I have to
to protect her.

07:51.667 --> 07:53.981
It's been good
to see you again, Clovis.

07:54.223 --> 07:57.698
I didn't realize how lonely I was
until tonight.

07:58.146 --> 08:00.643
Perhaps I can do more
to ease your loneliness

08:00.768 --> 08:02.573
once I return from Cato Neimoidia.

08:02.938 --> 08:04.783
You're taking a pleasure trip?

08:05.035 --> 08:06.035
Hardly.

08:06.391 --> 08:10.802
Going there to put the fear of Scipio in
those overgrown Trade Federation grubs.

08:11.088 --> 08:12.393
You know how they are.

08:12.518 --> 08:14.793
They love to borrow money
from the Banking Clan.

08:15.362 --> 08:17.087
But they hate to pay it back.

08:17.485 --> 08:19.848
Maybe you can say a few words
on my behalf.

08:19.973 --> 08:24.227
I'm on the holonet with the Neimoidians
every day asking for trade concessions,

08:24.352 --> 08:26.597
but I can't ever seem
to make progress.

08:26.765 --> 08:28.115
I've got an idea.

08:28.792 --> 08:30.526
Come with me to Cato Neimoidia.

08:30.651 --> 08:32.351
Speak to them in person.

08:32.626 --> 08:36.607
I have leverage from the Banking Clan.
You have diplomatic contacts.

08:37.349 --> 08:38.650
We can help each other.

08:38.897 --> 08:41.927
Are you inviting me
for political reasons

08:42.727 --> 08:44.865
or because you want us
to be friends again?

08:45.122 --> 08:46.422
Both, of course.

08:46.547 --> 08:50.551
Although I'm far more interested
in your friendship than your politics.

08:50.907 --> 08:54.314
In that case,
I'll be happy to go with you.

08:55.042 --> 08:57.586
It'll be like old times.

08:58.725 --> 09:00.025
On the contrary.

09:00.311 --> 09:03.011
I hope it'll be much better
than old times.

09:12.174 --> 09:13.624
You look exquisite.

09:18.416 --> 09:21.735
If you get tired,
you can rest your head on my shoulder.

09:22.064 --> 09:23.455
Allow me, my lady.

09:23.580 --> 09:26.208
And this one's broken.

09:27.240 --> 09:28.240
Too bad.

09:33.207 --> 09:35.428
We're ready for takeoff, captain.

09:35.553 --> 09:37.703
All I have to do is fly the ship.

09:52.891 --> 09:53.891
Blast it.

10:21.213 --> 10:24.853
Senator Amidala,
an unexpected privilege.

10:25.508 --> 10:29.511
Senator Dod, please forgive me
for arriving unannounced.

10:30.658 --> 10:33.015
Always a pleasure to see you,
my dear.

10:33.249 --> 10:36.607
I hope you and I
can make a fresh start.

10:36.893 --> 10:39.193
I came here with the very same hope.

10:39.533 --> 10:41.433
I believe in second chances.

10:41.942 --> 10:43.317
So do I, Senator.

10:43.718 --> 10:44.718
So do I.

10:49.956 --> 10:52.406
My servants will see you
to your room.

10:52.768 --> 10:57.003
Clovis and I have some business
to discuss.

11:02.401 --> 11:04.701
I hope you will be comfortable here.

11:05.985 --> 11:08.143
This investment by the Banking Clan

11:08.268 --> 11:11.306
will create
unimaginable new war profits,

11:11.431 --> 11:13.831
the largest droid factory
ever built.

11:14.137 --> 11:16.737
As long as the Republic
doesn't find out.

11:17.233 --> 11:20.354
You should never have brought
a member of the Senate here.

11:23.080 --> 11:24.630
After that long trip,

11:25.318 --> 11:27.392
I think I need a walk.

11:27.517 --> 11:29.196
That could prove interesting.

11:31.504 --> 11:33.054
I agree, Lord Poggle.

11:33.179 --> 11:35.115
For all the risks we're taking,

11:35.240 --> 11:38.390
we should be getting
a greater share of the profits.

11:46.151 --> 11:49.501
Are you suggesting we change
the terms of our agreement?

11:50.354 --> 11:51.704
A deal is a deal.

11:52.033 --> 11:54.471
I'd hate for something
to happen to you.

11:54.639 --> 11:56.812
You forget yourself, Clovis.

11:57.192 --> 12:00.018
You cannot threaten me
on my own planet.

12:00.186 --> 12:02.277
This is hardly your planet anymore,

12:02.402 --> 12:05.281
not since you signed
your holdings over to the Banking Clan

12:05.406 --> 12:08.356
in return for a stake
in this new droid foundry.

12:09.040 --> 12:10.154
We have company.

12:10.322 --> 12:11.472
The hologram.

12:14.184 --> 12:15.492
What are you doing here?

12:15.660 --> 12:17.636
Oh, I'm sorry to intrude.

12:17.761 --> 12:20.706
I was lonely,
so I came looking for you, and...

12:21.419 --> 12:24.627
My dear,
I'll give you a proper tour later.

12:25.503 --> 12:29.309
Now let me take you back to your room
so you can get dressed for dinner.

12:29.434 --> 12:30.924
Now, if you'll excuse me.

12:33.174 --> 12:34.595
I'll see you at dinner.

12:40.410 --> 12:42.110
How do you think I feel?

12:42.404 --> 12:45.054
I hate the thought
of answering to Clovis.

12:45.533 --> 12:48.607
But perhaps we won't have to...

12:48.732 --> 12:51.498
now that we've finally found
his weakness.

12:52.085 --> 12:55.486
What if we were to poison
Senator Amidala?

12:56.182 --> 12:59.223
I think Clovis would do anything
to save her.

12:59.348 --> 13:01.925
And only we would have the antidote.

13:10.011 --> 13:12.062
No, thanks, R2.
I'm not hungry.

13:12.187 --> 13:14.245
As soon as Senator Amidala
finds something,

13:14.370 --> 13:16.770
she's gonna signal me
to come inside.

13:31.399 --> 13:34.559
Senator, as my honored guest,

13:35.112 --> 13:37.760
please share this drink with me.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.833
A toast to our new friendship.

13:49.752 --> 13:50.752
Of course.

13:56.092 --> 13:57.094
Come, Senator.

13:57.598 --> 13:59.724
Everyone is eager to meet you.

14:08.486 --> 14:11.636
What a wonderfull meal.
My compliments to the droid.

14:17.433 --> 14:18.907
Are you feeling all right?

14:22.936 --> 14:23.936
I'm fine.

14:24.061 --> 14:27.609
- I stood up too fast.
- It has been a very long day.

14:27.734 --> 14:30.894
Perhaps we should retire
to the guest quarters?

14:31.019 --> 14:33.332
Unless you'd like
a tour of the palace.

14:33.457 --> 14:35.132
It's truly worth seeing.

14:35.585 --> 14:37.400
A tour sounds perfect.

14:38.536 --> 14:40.446
You're dismissed for the night.

14:40.571 --> 14:42.459
Are you absolutely sure?

14:44.371 --> 14:45.372
I'm sure.

14:51.644 --> 14:55.644
Well, really. My service is not required
for the rest of the evening.

14:56.084 --> 14:57.834
Why isn't Padmé with you?

14:58.186 --> 15:00.139
She is with Senator Clovis.

15:00.353 --> 15:02.367
He offered her a private tour
of the palace.

15:02.592 --> 15:04.137
And you let her go off with him?

15:04.262 --> 15:05.862
I did try to warn her.

15:09.716 --> 15:12.516
I'm waiting
for my business venture to start.

15:12.712 --> 15:16.264
I'm doing some private investing
with guaranteed returns.

15:17.100 --> 15:19.328
Could you bring me
something to drink?

15:19.453 --> 15:21.277
I'm so thirsty all of a sudden,

15:21.402 --> 15:23.037
and my head is pounding.

15:23.162 --> 15:24.412
You poor thing.

15:24.654 --> 15:26.278
It's the climate change.

15:26.403 --> 15:27.853
I'll be right back.

15:39.906 --> 15:41.354
Display hologram.

15:41.699 --> 15:43.628
<i>Pass code required.</i>

15:44.565 --> 15:45.565
Scipio.

15:46.480 --> 15:47.716
Banking Clan.

15:47.841 --> 15:49.091
Senator Clovis.

15:49.698 --> 15:51.400
Baron Rush Clovis.

15:51.979 --> 15:52.979
Rush.

15:55.034 --> 15:56.034
Padmé?

15:56.923 --> 15:58.603
<i>Pass code accepted.</i>

15:59.819 --> 16:03.219
Tactical coordinates
for Count Dooku's new droid foundry.

16:03.613 --> 16:06.264
And Clovis and the Banking Clan
are behind it.

16:06.433 --> 16:09.083
The Jedi Council
has to see this evidence.

16:11.980 --> 16:13.091
Finally.

16:13.217 --> 16:14.217
Got to go.

16:15.467 --> 16:17.567
Seems no one
wants my company tonight.

16:21.725 --> 16:23.325
Still dying of thirst?

16:33.657 --> 16:35.087
That tastes so good.

16:35.212 --> 16:36.586
I guess I was just thirsty.

16:37.381 --> 16:38.481
Come, Padmé.

16:38.901 --> 16:40.048
Give me your hand.

16:45.013 --> 16:46.654
You're so good to me, Clovis.

16:46.779 --> 16:48.779
I don't deserve your kindness.

16:49.841 --> 16:51.726
It's nice to hear you say that.

16:56.460 --> 16:59.210
I've been waiting
for this moment all night.

17:04.753 --> 17:06.304
Your heart is racing.

17:07.736 --> 17:08.986
Because of you.

17:09.526 --> 17:12.019
I wasn't sure
you still had feelings for me.

17:12.144 --> 17:13.144
But now...

17:15.790 --> 17:18.343
I would have said something earlier,

17:18.468 --> 17:21.638
but we were in the middle
of our official duties,

17:22.412 --> 17:23.962
and duty comes first,

17:24.503 --> 17:25.604
no matter...

17:26.105 --> 17:27.704
No matter how we feel.

17:28.172 --> 17:29.672
Padmé, what's wrong?

17:32.405 --> 17:33.977
Take good care of this, Artoo.

17:35.716 --> 17:37.564
Get the ship ready for takeoff.

17:40.598 --> 17:43.402
Stay with her.
I'll go get a medical droid.

17:43.527 --> 17:44.718
An excellent idea.

17:44.843 --> 17:47.991
I'm afraid this situation
is quite beyond my capacity.

17:49.998 --> 17:52.154
If I'm not here in five minutes,
leave without me.

17:52.279 --> 17:53.599
No matter what happens,

17:53.724 --> 17:56.124
the Council has to see
this hologram.

17:56.877 --> 17:59.294
I know her symptoms.
She's been poisoned.

17:59.462 --> 18:01.541
- What do you mean?
- She could die.

18:01.666 --> 18:03.716
Get ahold of yourself, Senator.

18:04.021 --> 18:06.095
She is a Republic spy.

18:06.817 --> 18:07.817
What?

18:18.777 --> 18:20.177
Pass code "Padmé."

18:20.467 --> 18:22.620
<i>No hologram is available.</i>

18:24.935 --> 18:26.285
She did steal it.

18:30.568 --> 18:31.568
Leave us.

18:34.179 --> 18:35.979
I was just in the library.

18:36.468 --> 18:38.268
The hologram disk is gone.

18:38.835 --> 18:41.435
I see now why you renewed
our friendship,

18:41.668 --> 18:44.450
so you could spy on me
and steal from me.

18:44.800 --> 18:46.600
I did it for the Republic.

18:47.277 --> 18:50.595
I didn't want to believe that
you were involved with the Separatists.

18:51.036 --> 18:52.136
But you are.

18:52.830 --> 18:53.890
You're a traitor.

18:54.332 --> 18:56.142
Where is the disk you stole?

18:56.344 --> 18:58.344
It's on its way to the senate.

18:59.052 --> 19:00.752
Your scheme is finished.

19:01.529 --> 19:02.649
Get away from her,

19:03.284 --> 19:04.651
if you want to live.

19:07.508 --> 19:08.510
Padmé.

19:08.635 --> 19:10.403
How dare you speak like that to me?

19:10.528 --> 19:11.728
I'm a Senator.

19:11.994 --> 19:13.368
What's wrong with her?

19:14.219 --> 19:15.819
Lott Dod poisoned her.

19:15.944 --> 19:16.944
She's dying.

19:17.778 --> 19:20.000
I'll take her
to the doctors on Coruscant.

19:20.169 --> 19:21.751
There's not enough time for that.

19:21.920 --> 19:23.970
Lott Dod must have an antidote.

19:24.594 --> 19:27.173
She's stolen
a very valuable disk from me.

19:27.298 --> 19:30.401
Return it,
and I'll get the antidote from Lott Dod.

19:30.609 --> 19:33.559
I'd prefer to negotiate
with Lott Dod in person.

19:34.380 --> 19:36.219
- He cannot be told...
- What?

19:36.344 --> 19:37.994
That you lost the disk?

19:38.778 --> 19:42.278
I'm sure he'd be very interested
in hearing all about this.

19:42.608 --> 19:44.758
He might kill me if he finds out.

19:45.103 --> 19:46.103
But still,

19:46.468 --> 19:48.618
it's her life that I worry about.

19:49.029 --> 19:51.323
She must be saved,
because I love her.

19:51.492 --> 19:52.642
In that case,

19:52.844 --> 19:55.728
I suggest you can help us
back to the Senator's ship

19:55.853 --> 19:57.871
before Lott Dod finds anything out.

19:58.835 --> 20:00.290
Come with me, quickly.

20:09.960 --> 20:11.410
We must make haste.

20:13.300 --> 20:15.050
What is going on, Clovis?

20:17.700 --> 20:18.767
I'm sorry, Lott.

20:18.936 --> 20:22.586
Senator Amidala is very ill,
and we're taking her to her ship.

20:23.014 --> 20:26.847
If Senator Amidala is ill,
she should not be moved.

20:27.766 --> 20:30.218
I have contacted
the authorities on Naboo.

20:30.343 --> 20:32.719
They thought it best
to take her back to Coruscant.

20:32.844 --> 20:34.741
The doctors there
are better equipped.

20:34.910 --> 20:36.260
You cannot leave.

20:37.319 --> 20:39.722
Give me the antidote,
or you're dead.

20:40.101 --> 20:42.096
You'll pay for this.

20:42.966 --> 20:45.085
Give Clovis the antidote.

20:48.719 --> 20:51.628
Your kindness is much appreciated,
Senator.

20:52.164 --> 20:53.468
Take her, quickly.

20:56.405 --> 20:58.105
Have you lost your mind?

21:02.995 --> 21:04.021
Wait.

21:04.236 --> 21:05.986
Now give me back my disk.

21:06.466 --> 21:07.966
Don't worry, Clovis.

21:08.175 --> 21:10.340
It's good to know you have a heart.

21:10.465 --> 21:12.070
I wish I could give you the disk,

21:12.239 --> 21:14.698
but I have a lot of faith
in your survival skills.

21:17.652 --> 21:19.752
Where's that medicine, Threepio?

21:32.463 --> 21:33.463
I'm sorry.

21:34.527 --> 21:35.527
What for?

21:35.710 --> 21:38.095
We got away,
and we have the hologram.

21:38.220 --> 21:42.170
The Jedi will use that information
to destroy Count Dooku's foundry.

21:42.718 --> 21:44.185
Your mission was a success.

21:45.154 --> 21:46.854
But I made you doubt me.

21:47.496 --> 21:48.496
Never.

21:49.361 --> 21:51.942
Clovis, we need to talk.

21:52.305 --> 21:58.432
