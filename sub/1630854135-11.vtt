All the guys coming

Duran.

04:19.884 --> 04:21.594
Look, apparently,
he owns Miami.

Now he wants New York.

04:23.471 --> 04:25.765
He's in town for two days

04:35.400 --> 04:37.360
Yeah, I think you're right.

04:37.402 --> 04:39.070
So let's use it
to our advantage.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.530
Maybe Duran can't trust you.

You're a crooked bastard

it was fake, then--

- Mm-hmm.
- You really think it'll work?

06:12.205 --> 06:14.249

offload that new shipment

06:14.290 --> 06:16.084

I pose as a buyer

06:59.127 --> 07:01.921

07:01.963 --> 07:04.090

07:10.180 --> 07:11.514
I could have done it, Jet.

07:11.556 --> 07:12.932
But then
he wouldn't be the guy.

You ditched your wire.

07:48.677 --> 07:50.303
we reached out

07:50.345 --> 07:51.513
Yeah?

Who exactly did you

08:01.398 --> 08:03.149

08:06.027 --> 08:07.987
- Tell me more about
this next move of yours.

08:08.029 --> 08:10.281

from Miami doing here?

08:10.323 --> 08:11.700
They're here to help.

08:11.741 --> 08:12.909
Right. Why?

08:12.951 --> 08:14.452
- Their captain
reached out to me,

08:14.494 --> 08:17.664
offered to give us everything
they knew to help grab him.

08:17.706 --> 08:19.332
- So they're gonna
help us grab him?

08:19.374 --> 08:21.584
Mm.

08:21.626 --> 08:24.045
I'd like you
to make them feel welcome.

Excuse me.

08:31.136 --> 08:33.722

zero jurisdiction here.

08:33.763 --> 08:34.889
What's he thinking?

08:34.931 --> 08:36.516
He's thinking he's new,

08:36.558 --> 08:37.851
and he wants to do things
differently.

08:37.892 --> 08:40.812
- Huh.
How do you feel about that?

08:40.854 --> 08:43.440
- I feel like
we're on the clock,

08:43.481 --> 08:44.691
and we don't have time
to waste,

08:44.733 --> 08:46.860
so let's play nice for now.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.407
Play nice.

08:52.449 --> 08:54.075
- His full name
is Antonio Duran.

08:54.117 --> 08:56.911
Came over from Cuba during
the Mariel boatlift in 1980,

08:56.953 --> 08:58.663
looking for the American Dream,

08:58.705 --> 09:00.123
which, of course,
meant selling drugs.

09:00.165 --> 09:01.916
- You guys know
the cocaine cowboys?

09:01.958 --> 09:03.251
He was an original member.

09:03.293 --> 09:04.586
Except he didn't get caught.

09:04.627 --> 09:06.588
- Until 2001,
when the Feds grabbed him

09:06.629 --> 09:07.714
on money laundering charges.

09:07.756 --> 09:09.215
Got a six-year sentence,

09:09.257 --> 09:11.551
which would have been three
with good behavior.

09:11.593 --> 09:13.178
But this happened
while he was inside.

09:13.219 --> 09:14.554
- That's Duran
doing the shanking.

09:14.596 --> 09:16.056
Added 16 years.

09:16.097 --> 09:17.432
Why'd he do it?

09:17.474 --> 09:19.601
- At the sentencing,
he said the guy was a snitch,

09:19.642 --> 09:22.395
and he'd do it all over again.

09:22.437 --> 09:24.731
- So now Duran is out
and back to selling product.

09:24.773 --> 09:26.399
In the '80s, it was cocaine.

09:26.441 --> 09:29.819
These days, he's into molly,
fentanyl, occasionally heroin.

09:29.861 --> 09:31.988
- Past six months,
Miami has seen a major spike

09:32.030 --> 09:34.157
in drug-related ODs
and homicides,

09:34.199 --> 09:36.451
and all signs point to Duran,
but--

09:36.493 --> 09:38.745
- He's hard to track,
and we don't have much help.

09:38.787 --> 09:40.121
People are scared to talk.

09:40.163 --> 09:42.624
- Yeah, we ran into that
problem in the Heights.

09:42.665 --> 09:45.335
- Only reason we even know he's
connected to the street racers

trafficker in your custody

They're watching you closely.

24:07.113 --> 24:08.823
Okay.

24:08.865 --> 24:11.493
Anybody has a problem
with me or how I run OCCB,

24:11.534 --> 24:13.286

24:13.328 --> 24:15.330
Yeah, they'll tell me first.

24:15.372 --> 24:16.915
And if things go south,
I can't protect you.

24:16.956 --> 24:18.875
I don't have that pull yet.

24:18.917 --> 24:21.419
Well, this is how you get it.

25:57.015 --> 25:59.225
- What are you thinking,
raiding my investigation?

25:59.267 --> 26:01.269

Duran was setting up a buy

- out of the bar.
- Yeah? What did you find?

26:02.937 --> 26:04.564
- DEA is still
doing their sweep.

26:04.606 --> 26:05.690
They can sweep all they want.

26:05.732 --> 26:06.900
They're not gonna find anything

26:06.941 --> 26:08.109
'cause Duran doesn't have
product here.

26:08.151 --> 26:09.361
- Well, you could
have told us that.

26:09.402 --> 26:11.363
Frankly, you could
have told us anything.

26:35.428 --> 26:37.514

- What are you talking about?

26:37.555 --> 26:40.558
- Duran's bar just got raided
by the DEA.

26:40.600 --> 26:42.185
A bar that they shouldn't
have known anything about.

26:42.227 --> 26:44.145

- No, Miami did!

And I'm asking you what it was
you've said to Miami.

26:47.399 --> 26:49.859

I didn't tell them anything.

Yeah, sorry to just drop in,

27:21.474 --> 27:23.977
but I wanted to give you
a heads-up in person.

27:24.019 --> 27:25.395
Duran's gone.

27:25.437 --> 27:27.063
As far as we know, he could
already be back in Miami.

27:27.105 --> 27:28.440
And out of our jurisdiction.

27:28.481 --> 27:30.150
- The good news is,
our kidnapping victim

27:30.191 --> 27:31.526
can directly tie Cristobal

27:31.568 --> 27:32.902
to the street racing
and drug running--

27:32.944 --> 27:34.946
- Cristobal was never
our target.

27:36.656 --> 27:37.991
Take the win, Detective.

27:38.033 --> 27:40.118
Duran's case is being
turned over to the DEA.

27:40.160 --> 27:41.578
I'm meeting with the agent
in charge this afternoon.

27:41.619 --> 27:43.955
- You good with this?
- It's not her call.

27:46.166 --> 27:47.917
Or mine.

27:47.959 --> 27:50.962
As soon as Miami brought in the
DEA, it was out of our hands.

27:51.004 --> 27:53.256
Well, Miami called the DEA,

27:53.298 --> 27:55.800
but they wouldn't have
moved in without your approval.

27:58.261 --> 27:59.763
- I tried to give you
a heads-up, Detective,

27:59.804 --> 28:01.222
but you were in the field.

28:01.264 --> 28:02.474
I didn't wanna
break your cover.

28:02.515 --> 28:03.808
You didn't need to.

28:03.850 --> 28:05.393
You got the DEA
to do that for you.

28:05.435 --> 28:08.938
<i>* *</i>

28:08.980 --> 28:10.774
You should have called me.

28:10.815 --> 28:12.525

my limits here.

28:12.567 --> 28:14.569
And we got Cristobal.

28:14.611 --> 28:16.029
Let's not go out of our way

28:16.071 --> 28:17.489
to make this look bad now,
shall we?

28:20.533 --> 28:21.534
Excuse me.

28:24.496 --> 28:26.331
Whose side is he on?

28:26.373 --> 28:27.832
His.

28:31.169 --> 28:33.463
- Hey.
- Hey.

28:33.505 --> 28:35.507
Break room. Break room.

28:42.430 --> 28:44.057
Close the door.

28:46.476 --> 28:48.978
So we've just been informed
that Duran is in the wind,

28:49.020 --> 28:52.273
and this is now
officially a DEA case.

28:52.315 --> 28:54.359

28:56.027 --> 28:57.570
So what's next?

28:57.612 --> 28:59.447
- Our phones track
our movements, right?

28:59.489 --> 29:02.158
- Unless you turn it off,
which no one ever does.

29:02.200 --> 29:03.868
Cristobal was Duran's muscle.

29:03.910 --> 29:05.662
Wherever he went, Duran went.

29:05.704 --> 29:07.330
- You think that Duran
might still be in town?

29:07.372 --> 29:08.873
- And if he is,
then Cristobal's

29:08.915 --> 29:11.835
previous location data might
give us an idea where he's at.

29:11.876 --> 29:13.378
I need his phone.

29:13.420 --> 29:15.463
- No, that phone's gotta be
in DEA custody at this point.

29:15.505 --> 29:16.589
- I don't think they're gonna
be sharing that

29:16.631 --> 29:17.882
with us anytime soon.

29:17.924 --> 29:19.384
We don't need them to.

29:19.426 --> 29:21.094
Phone carrier is gonna have
his GPS data.

29:21.136 --> 29:22.887
- Just need a subpoena.
- I'll get the subpoena.

29:22.929 --> 29:24.514
Good idea.

29:24.556 --> 29:26.141
I just need you
to run interference with--

29:26.182 --> 29:28.435

and then there's this.

29:40.655 --> 29:42.991

You're afraid.

But you're playing

Oh, well.

You lied about being a driver,

It was his gift to me.

- The drug charges,
the kidnapping.

That's gonna be

He's not gonna
help you anymore, Bernanda.

He never planned to.

34:53.802 --> 34:56.930

Duran had a daughter?

And once a year,
but only at night,

35:38.096 --> 35:39.973
you could go down to the beach

35:40.015 --> 35:43.018

come up out of the sand

35:43.059 --> 35:45.186

Antonio, I bet your mama would
love to hear this story, huh?

36:05.081 --> 36:06.958
Can you go find her? Go.

36:11.755 --> 36:13.798
How did you find this--

36:19.220 --> 36:22.307
I need to talk.

36:22.349 --> 36:24.059
Not here.

36:33.318 --> 36:35.236
- The bar was raided.
- Mm-hmm.

36:35.278 --> 36:37.113
- By the DEA.
- Yeah.

36:37.155 --> 36:40.116
I tried to get in touch.

36:40.158 --> 36:41.785
Cristobal is dead.

36:41.826 --> 36:43.370
I know.

36:43.411 --> 36:45.246
I know what happened.

36:45.288 --> 36:47.791
So what do I do?

36:47.832 --> 36:49.250
There's evidence
that connects me

36:49.292 --> 36:51.795

36:51.836 --> 36:54.339
And I'm all alone here.

[chuckles]

36:59.260 --> 37:02.138
I can't help you.

37:02.180 --> 37:05.517
I told you not to get involved
with Cristobal.

37:05.558 --> 37:08.436

37:08.478 --> 37:09.771
He knows she's wired.

37:09.813 --> 37:10.897
<i>You could tell?</i>

37:10.939 --> 37:13.942
But he was running drugs
for you.

37:15.819 --> 37:19.239
- Bernanda, if you are involved
with this drug running,

37:19.280 --> 37:23.243
I don't wanna know anything
about it, hmm?

37:23.284 --> 37:27.080
And you brought this here
to my home, to my family.

37:27.122 --> 37:28.665
No, no.

37:28.707 --> 37:30.625
You need to leave.

37:34.295 --> 37:35.463
Bernanda.

37:38.466 --> 37:39.759
What are you doing?

37:39.801 --> 37:42.262
What is she doing?

37:42.303 --> 37:44.514
<i>Tell them.</i>

37:44.556 --> 37:48.768
Tell them that
you run the drugs.

37:48.810 --> 37:51.062

37:51.104 --> 37:52.772

- Let's go!

37:54.983 --> 37:58.820
- You told me that
New York will be mine.

37:58.862 --> 38:03.783
That we will start
a family, Antonio.

38:05.577 --> 38:07.620

Get a bus.

38:39.069 --> 38:41.237
Cuff her up.

38:41.279 --> 38:44.199

Oh, hey. Come in.

39:18.566 --> 39:20.527
Where's Miami?

39:20.568 --> 39:21.611
Cleared out.

39:21.653 --> 39:23.905
- I'm devastated.
How's your end?

39:23.947 --> 39:26.700
- Bernanda Menendez
is being indicted

39:26.741 --> 39:28.368
as the leader
of the street gang,

39:28.410 --> 39:30.161

39:30.203 --> 39:32.414
- Wow, they couldn't find
anything to tie in Duran?

39:32.455 --> 39:35.458
- He's no longer
their problem, so.

39:35.500 --> 39:36.584
- He's not anybody's
problem anymore.

Hey.

39:40.630 --> 39:45.010
- Um, good job
with Bernanda earlier.

39:45.051 --> 39:47.554
I didn't get a chance
to tell you.

39:47.595 --> 39:48.847
Thanks.

39:48.888 --> 39:52.142
- And Miami,
the way you worked them.

It's very smart.

39:57.564 --> 39:58.732
No.

What's with the attitude?

40:00.900 --> 40:02.402
- Sorry.
- No, you're not.

40:06.197 --> 40:07.574

okay?

40:07.615 --> 40:09.034
I disobeyed an order.

40:09.075 --> 40:10.535
I shouldn't have done that.

40:10.577 --> 40:12.037
But you didn't have
to humiliate me.

40:12.078 --> 40:14.414
- What are you talking about?
- You literally killed me.

40:14.456 --> 40:16.249
You made me look like
a snitch on camera,

40:16.291 --> 40:17.417
and the worst part is,
you enjoyed it.

40:17.459 --> 40:18.585
It was part of the operation.

40:18.626 --> 40:20.003
- Well, you took me out
of the op.

40:20.045 --> 40:22.213
Then you punish me,
you make me a babysitter.

It's just--

40:27.802 --> 40:30.847
That's not how I meant it.

about ego or pride

This is about us
