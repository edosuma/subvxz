WEBVTT

00:07.670 --> 00:13.734
* THIS IS MY FATHER'S WORLD

00:13.780 --> 00:18.046
* AND TO MY LISTENING EARS

00:28.220 --> 00:33.795
* THIS IS MY FATHER'S WORLD

00:50.810 --> 00:56.282
WALLY, THAT WAS
JUST AMAZING.

00:56.320 --> 00:57.582
CHARLIE, DID YOU HEAR THAT?

00:57.620 --> 00:59.110
YES, MOM, I HEARD IT.

00:59.160 --> 01:00.684
I'M GONNA SING
AT MRS. HA'ITEN'S
CHRISTMAS PARTY,

01:00.720 --> 01:04.383
AND SHE SAID SHE'S GONNA
GIVE ME $5.00 FOR IT.

01:04.430 --> 01:05.158
$5.00?

01:05.190 --> 01:06.748
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS

01:06.800 --> 01:08.722
WHY, YOU'RE A PROFESSIONAL.

01:08.760 --> 01:11.763
CHARLIE, WILL YOU WALK
WALLY HOME, PLEASE?

01:11.800 --> 01:16.100
I WAS GONNA GO OVER TO
TOMMY'S AND SHOOT SOME POOL.

01:16.140 --> 01:20.338
COME ON, ELVIS.
LET'S GET GOING.

01:20.380 --> 01:23.838
WALLY. ..
YOUR BACKPACK.

02:08.920 --> 02:10.649
AAH!

02:27.480 --> 02:29.778
HOPE EVERYONE
HAD A RESTFUL WEEKEND.

02:29.810 --> 02:30.742
THAT SOUNDS OMINOUS.

02:30.780 --> 02:34.477
HARRINGTONVILLE, TENNESSEE,
POPULATION 5,000.

02:34.520 --> 02:36.317
64 YEARS SINCE
THEY HAD A HOMICIDE.

02:36.350 --> 02:37.612
THEY'VE HAD 2
IN THE PAST 48 HOURS.

02:37.650 --> 02:40.778
FIRST VICTIM, 57-YEAR-OLD
WIDOWER AND GRANDFATHER
PAUL THOMPSON.

02:40.820 --> 02:44.654
AMBUSHED IN HIS YARD,
18 STAB WOUNDS TO HIS
CHEST AND HIS NECK.

02:44.690 --> 02:47.898
NO FORCED ENTRY INTO THE HOUSE,
AND THE ONLY ITEM TAKEN
WAS A SHOTGUN.

02:47.930 --> 02:50.899
LAST NIGHT, ANNIE STUART,
39, WAS ALSO AMBUSHED

02:50.930 --> 02:53.797
AND IT APPEARS
BLUDGEONED TO DEATH
IN HER HOME

02:53.840 --> 02:55.330
WITH THOMPSON'S
STOLEN SHOTGUN.

02:55.370 --> 02:57.804
IN THIS CASE, THE UNSUB
APPARENTLY STOLE CDs,

02:57.840 --> 02:59.478
DVDs, AND A LITTLE JEWELRY.

02:59.510 --> 03:01.273
THIS IS A LITTLE EXTREME
FOR A BURGLARY.

03:01.310 --> 03:02.277
THAT'S AN UNDERSTATEMENT.

03:02.310 --> 03:04.198
AS YOU CAN SEE, ANNIE'S
THROAT WAS EVISCERATED.

03:04.250 --> 03:05.603
YET THE FIRST VICTIM
WASN'T EVISCERATED,

03:05.650 --> 03:09.882
AND THE UNSUB SEEMS TO
HAVE USED A DIFFERENT WEAPON
AT EACH CRIME SCENE.

03:09.920 --> 03:10.909
2 DIFFERENT M.O.s.

03:10.950 --> 03:11.689
2 DIFFERENT KILLERS?

03:11.720 --> 03:13.358
OR ONE VERY PSYCHOTIC
INDIVIDUAL.

03:13.390 --> 03:14.516
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

03:14.560 --> 03:16.949
I GOT A LIST OF THINGS
I WANT TO TRY BEFORE
IT'S TOO LATE.

03:16.990 --> 03:19.356
AND ORTHOPEDIC SURGERY'S
ONE OF THEM?

03:19.400 --> 03:20.196
NO, SKYDIVING.

03:20.230 --> 03:22.824
APPARENTLY
IT'S ALL ABOUT THE LANDING.

03:22.870 --> 03:24.724
HOW LONG ON THE CRUTCHES?

03:24.770 --> 03:25.498
JUST A COUPLE DAYS.

03:25.530 --> 03:26.997
SO YOU CAN'T GO OUT
IN THE FIELD?

03:27.040 --> 03:27.995
NOT ON CRUTCHES, NO.

03:28.040 --> 03:30.759
DON'T WORRY. I'LL FIND A WAY
TO BE HELPFUL HERE.

03:30.810 --> 03:31.765
GOT A BLITZ ATI'ACK.

03:31.810 --> 03:34.904
NO EFFORT TO REMOVE THE
BODY, CLEAN UP EVIDENCE.

03:34.940 --> 03:36.009
WITH ORGANIZED KILLERS,

03:36.040 --> 03:38.008
WE SEE A PATTERN, WE'RE ABLE
TO PREDICT THEIR BEHAVIOR,

03:38.050 --> 03:39.278
BUT WITH PSYCHOTIC KILLERS,

03:39.320 --> 03:40.776
THEY'RE GUIDED BY
A GIVEN DELUSION.

03:40.820 --> 03:43.288
OK, UNTIL WE UNDERSTAND
THE NATURE OF THE DELUSION,

03:43.320 --> 03:45.288
WE CAN'T PREDICT
HIS NEXT MOVE.

03:45.320 --> 03:47.584
THAT'S NEARLY
IMPOSSIBLE TO DO.

03:47.620 --> 03:50.384
ACTUALLY, I THINK
WE MIGHT HAVE A CLUE.

03:50.430 --> 03:52.398
THESE RINGS
AT THAT CRIME SCENE

03:52.430 --> 03:53.624
MIGHT BE
SOME KIND OF SIGNATURE?

03:53.660 --> 03:54.729
I CAN WORK THIS ANGLE.

03:54.760 --> 03:56.728
I'LL SEE IF THERE'S
ANY SIGNIFICANCE
TO THE PATTERNS.

03:56.770 --> 04:00.638
PSYCHOTIC KILLERS
ARE NORMALLY NOT THAT
DIFFICULT TO CATCH

04:00.670 --> 04:01.796
BECAUSE THEY DON'T
TRY TO HIDE.

04:01.840 --> 04:03.034
DOES THAT MAKE
YOUR JOB EASIER?

04:03.070 --> 04:05.538
OH, NO. 'CAUSE
UNTIL WE DO LOCATE HIM,

04:05.570 --> 04:07.572
HE'LL KEEP DOING THAT.

04:34.640 --> 04:39.373
CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY
TOUCHSTONE TELEVISION
PRODUCTIONS, LLC AND CBS

04:48.820 --> 04:49.912
THEY HERE?

04:49.950 --> 04:53.408
SOME OF 'EM.
ONE OF 'EM WENT OVER
TO THE THOMPSON HOUSE.

04:53.460 --> 04:54.449
ALONE?

04:54.490 --> 04:56.720
SAID HE WANTED TO GET A FEEL
FOR THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

04:56.760 --> 04:58.057
ALL OF THE ITEMS STOLEN

04:58.090 --> 05:00.923
WERE TAKEN FROM
THE UPSTAIRS BEDROOM.

05:00.960 --> 05:04.828
WHY DIDN'T HE TAKE
HER PURSE OR CELL PHONE

05:04.870 --> 05:06.861
OR THE JEWELRY
OFF HER BODY?

05:06.900 --> 05:08.834
IT JUST DOESN'T
MAKE ANY SENSE.

05:08.870 --> 05:10.633
DIDN'T MAKE SENSE
TO US, EITHER.

05:10.670 --> 05:13.730
THIS GUY DIDN'T COME ANY CLOSER
TO HER THAN HE HAD TO.

05:13.780 --> 05:14.576
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

05:14.610 --> 05:16.874
THERE'S A DISCREPANCY
IN THE PROFILE.

05:16.910 --> 05:18.969
SHERIFF HALL,
IT'S QUITE POSSIBLE

05:19.010 --> 05:20.875
THERE WERE 2 PEOPLE
IN THE HOUSE.

05:20.920 --> 05:22.683
SO I HAVE 2 MONSTERS
OUT THERE?

05:22.720 --> 05:25.746
SOMEONE WENT THROUGH
THE MEDICINE CABINET
LOOKING FOR DRUGS.

05:25.790 --> 05:27.849
EXCESSIVE
METHAMPHETAMINE ABUSE

05:27.890 --> 05:29.755
CAN CAUSE PSYCHOTIC
VIOLENT EPISODES.

05:29.790 --> 05:31.451
SO YOU THINK THESE GUYS
WERE JUNKIES?

05:31.490 --> 05:34.493
I THINK WE'RE DEALING WITH
2 DIFFERENT PROFILES.

05:34.530 --> 05:36.623
THE KILLER,
YEAH, HE'S A PSYCHOTIC.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.467
THE OTHER GUY, THOUGH,
HE'S JUST A THIEF.

05:38.500 --> 05:41.799
I MEAN, THE FACT THAT HE DIDN'T
TAKE THE VICTIM'S JEWELRY

05:41.840 --> 05:44.502
SUGGESTS THAT
HE IDENTIFIED WITH HER.

05:44.540 --> 05:45.632
MEANING WHAT?

05:45.670 --> 05:46.602
HE PROBABLY KNEW HER.

05:46.640 --> 05:50.406
CSU FOUND A SODA CAN
BY THE FENCE IN THE GRASS.

05:50.450 --> 05:52.645
IT'S MARKED BY THAT CONE.

05:52.680 --> 05:53.817
THAT'S RIGHT.

05:53.850 --> 05:54.748
WE FIGURE THE SUSPECT--

05:54.780 --> 05:57.112
THE SUSPECTS,
WAS LYING IN WAIT THERE.

05:57.150 --> 05:59.789
YOU SPOKE TO THE KID
WHO WAS HAVING A SINGING LESSON?

05:59.820 --> 06:01.082
THAT'S RIGHT. WHY?

06:01.120 --> 06:05.989
I'M JUST WONDERING
WHY HE DIDN'T TELL YOU
THAT HE SAW THE SUSPECT.

06:06.030 --> 06:06.826
WHAT?

06:06.860 --> 06:09.693
WELL, CSU FOUND
4 OF WALLY BRISBANE'S

06:09.730 --> 06:10.492
FINGERPRINTS RIGHT HERE

06:10.530 --> 06:12.794
ON THE MUSIC STAND
IN THIS POSITION.

06:12.840 --> 06:15.866
NOW, FROM WHERE
I'M STANDING, MY HEIGHT,

06:15.900 --> 06:18.460
I GOT TREE BRANCHES
BLOCKING MY WAY.

06:18.510 --> 06:23.641
BUT WALLY'S 7, SO THAT WOULD
PUT HIS EYE-LINE RIGHT ABOUT...

06:23.680 --> 06:25.978
HERE.

06:33.920 --> 06:35.057
HI.

06:35.090 --> 06:36.455
I'M ELLE GREENAWAY

06:36.490 --> 06:39.891
FROM THE BEHAVIORAL
ANALYSIS UNIT OF THE FBI.

06:39.930 --> 06:42.967
I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHERIFF HALL
WAS THINKING

06:43.000 --> 06:45.662
ASKING ME TO BRING HIM
OVER HERE.

06:45.700 --> 06:46.837
I NEED TO TALK TO YOUR SON.

06:46.870 --> 06:50.135
LISTEN, I THINK
HE'S BEEN THROUGH ENOUGH.

06:50.170 --> 06:55.198
MRS. BRISBANE, WE'RE REALLY
JUST HERE TO HELP.

06:55.240 --> 07:00.018
ASK HIM WHATEVER YOU WANT,
BUT I'M STAYING RIGHT HERE.

07:04.990 --> 07:08.619
WALLY, I HEAR...

07:08.660 --> 07:10.753
THAT YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON
IN THIS WHOLE TOWN

07:10.790 --> 07:13.588
WHO MIGHT HAVE SEEN
THE MAN WHO DID THIS
TO YOUR MUSIC TEACHER.

07:13.630 --> 07:18.567
HE DIDN'T SEE A THING,
NOW, DID YOU, BUDDY?

07:18.600 --> 07:20.067
WALLY.

07:22.040 --> 07:25.066
WHAT DID HE LOOK LIKE?

07:27.980 --> 07:28.969
CRAZY.

07:29.010 --> 07:33.242
HE WAS REAL TALL,
REAL SKINNY,

07:33.280 --> 07:35.248
AND HIS LIP WAS BLEEDING,

07:35.280 --> 07:41.185
AND WHEN I SAW HIM THROUGH
THE WINDOW, HE DID THIS...

07:45.260 --> 07:48.821
THE GUY THE KID
DESCRIBED DEFINITELY
SOUNDS LIKE A TWEAKER.

07:48.860 --> 07:52.864
PULL THE FILES OF ALL
THE METHAMPHETAMINE ARRESTS
IN THE PAST 6 MONTHS.

07:52.900 --> 07:53.696
WILL DO.

07:53.740 --> 07:54.991
WE SHOULD NARROW
THE SUSPECT LIST DOWN

07:55.040 --> 07:56.029
ACCORDING TO
THE GUY'S RESIDENCE.

07:56.070 --> 07:59.005
CRIMES LIKE TH ESE ARE ALWAYS
CRIMES OF OPPORTUNITY.

07:59.040 --> 08:00.905
SO THE FIRST GUY
ON OUR SUSPECT LIST

08:00.940 --> 08:02.976
WILL LIVE IN THE CLOSEST
PROXIMITY TO THE VICTIM.

08:03.010 --> 08:05.046
DO HAVE A PLACE
WHERE WE CAN SET UP?

08:05.080 --> 08:06.843
YOU CAN USE
SIMPSON'S DESK. HE'S OUT.

08:06.880 --> 08:08.643
YOU GOT A PHONE THERE
AND A COMPUTER.

08:08.680 --> 08:12.719
MEANTIME, I'M GONNA
NARROW DOWN THAT LIST.

08:14.190 --> 08:19.594
WORKING FROM THE ASSUMPTION
THE RINGS ARE A SIGNATURE...

08:19.630 --> 08:22.827
SIR, I COULD HELP YOU
GET SOME OF THESE BOOKS
BACK TO YOUR--

08:22.870 --> 08:25.521
EXPLORING THEIR
SYMBOLIC SIGNIFICANCE?

08:25.570 --> 08:30.860
JUST EXPLORING...
I HAVE NOTHING.

08:30.910 --> 08:33.231
WELL, IF--IF I MAY,
IF YOU WERE IN YOUR OFFICE,

08:33.280 --> 08:38.673
YOU'D HAVE MORE ROOM
TO SPREAD OUT, AND YOU'D
GET A FRESH PERSPECTIVE.

08:38.710 --> 08:41.042
DO YOU THINK?

08:41.080 --> 08:42.980
MAYBE

08:43.020 --> 08:47.286
I NEED TO FOCUS
ON THE MANNER IN WHICH
ANNIE STUART WAS KILLED.

08:47.320 --> 08:50.983
ANYTHING THAT MIGHT
HAVE BEEN DONE TO HER
POSTMORTEM.

08:51.030 --> 08:51.758
UH-HUH.

08:51.790 --> 08:54.099
GET THIS STUFF
OUT OF HERE. SORRY.

08:54.130 --> 08:56.963
WHERE ARE THE, UH,
BLUEPRINTS OF THE HOUSE?

08:57.000 --> 08:58.467
OH, THEY'RE RIGHT HERE
ON THE SCREEN.

08:58.500 --> 09:01.594
I DON'T WANT THE BLUEPRINTS
ON THE SCREEN. I WANT
SOMETHING I CAN HOLD ONTO.

09:01.640 --> 09:03.938
HERE YOU GO.
IT'S HOT IN HERE.
CAN YOU FIX IT?

09:03.970 --> 09:04.902
HOW DO YOU BREATHE IN HERE?

09:04.940 --> 09:06.168
CAN YOU TRY TO MAKE IT
A LITTLE COOLER IN HERE?

09:06.210 --> 09:07.802
YEAH, IT'S PRETTY COLD, BUT--
DO YOU HAVE
THE AUTOPSY REPORTS?

09:07.840 --> 09:11.003
I'M GONNA HAVE THE SHERIFF
FROM HARRINGTONVILLE FAX IT
OVER AS SOON AS THEY COME IN.

09:11.050 --> 09:12.301
CAN I HAVE ANOTHER
A CUP OF COFFEE,
IF YOU WOULD?

09:12.350 --> 09:14.011
THEY'RE RIGHT HERE.
GOT IT.

09:14.050 --> 09:15.074
I'LL GET THE COFFEE.

09:15.120 --> 09:16.109
THANK YOU.

09:16.150 --> 09:18.118
YOU'RE WELCOME.

09:24.660 --> 09:27.049
HEY, YOU GUYS
FIND ANYTHING?

09:27.100 --> 09:28.021
YEAH.

09:28.060 --> 09:28.924
ELLE FOUND AN EYEWITNESS--

09:28.960 --> 09:30.962
LITTLE BOY WHO SAW SOMEONE
IN THE DRIVEWAY.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.069
THAT'S MORE THAN WE GOT
AT THOMPSON'S.

09:32.100 --> 09:35.797
WE GOT 2 SUSPECTS.
JUDD FRANKLIN
AND DOMINO THACKER.

09:35.840 --> 09:37.967
I KNOW DOMINO.
HE'S BAD NEWS.

09:38.010 --> 09:40.137
SERIOUS TWEAKER.
COOKS HIS OWN STUFF.

09:40.180 --> 09:42.034
HE LIVE NEAR THE CRIME SCENES?

09:42.080 --> 09:43.638
ALMOST DIRECTLY
BETWEEN THEM.

09:43.680 --> 09:44.999
ROBBERY, ARMED ROBBERY,

09:45.050 --> 09:47.371
POSSESSION, POSSESSION
WITH INTENT.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.149
THIS GUY'S
BEEN HOSPITALIZED

09:49.180 --> 09:51.319
FOR OVERDOSES
AND ATTEMPTED SUICIDE.

09:51.350 --> 09:52.044
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

09:52.090 --> 09:55.116
I THINK WE NEED
TO FIND DOMINO.

10:00.030 --> 10:03.796
DOMINO THACKER, FBI!
STAY. DON'T MOVE.

10:03.830 --> 10:08.733
NO, NO, NO, DON'T RUN. I JUST
WANT TO TALK TO YOU. DOMINO!

10:09.040 --> 10:12.305
I JUST WANT TO TALK.
STOP!

10:16.040 --> 10:16.699
STAY DOWN!

10:16.750 --> 10:18.001
I DIDN'T DO NOTHIN'.
STAY DOWN!

10:18.050 --> 10:20.041
I DIDN'T DO NOTHIN'.

10:21.220 --> 10:22.983
YOU CAN'T ARREST ME.

10:23.020 --> 10:27.389
DOMINO THACKER, FBI.
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

10:29.360 --> 10:31.726
I'M FREEZIN'.

10:31.760 --> 10:35.924
WE WANT TO KNOW
WHAT YOU WERE DOING
AT ANNIE STUART'S HOUSE.

10:35.960 --> 10:38.019
I DIDN'T DO NOTHIN'.

10:38.070 --> 10:39.298
I GOT THE FLU.

10:39.330 --> 10:42.390
I'M SICK IS WHAT I AM.

10:42.440 --> 10:45.204
WE KNOW YOU WERE THERE, BOY.

10:45.240 --> 10:46.901
IN THE DRIVEWAY.

10:46.940 --> 10:50.171
I WAS LOOKIN' AT THAT CAR,

10:50.210 --> 10:52.075
BUT I NEVER STOLED IT.

10:52.110 --> 10:55.045
I WAS THINKIN' ABOUT IT,
BUT I LEFT.

10:55.080 --> 10:56.274
I SEEN THAT KID.

10:56.320 --> 11:00.450
THE BLOOD FOUND ON
THE BOTTOM OF YOUR BOOT
IS ANNIE STUART'S.

11:00.490 --> 11:02.378
THE TREAD FROM
THE BOTTOM OF YOUR BOOT

11:02.420 --> 11:06.925
IS THE SAME AS
THE TREAD FOUND ALL OVER
THE CRIME SCENE.

11:06.960 --> 11:09.121
INSIDE!

11:09.160 --> 11:12.891
I DIDN'T DO NOTHIN'.

11:13.470 --> 11:14.539
COME ON NOW, DOMINO.

11:14.570 --> 11:17.130
HOW DO YOU THINK THAT'S
GONNA HOLD UP IN COURT,
HUH?

11:17.170 --> 11:22.904
TWEAKER WITH A RECORD,
BLOOD OF THE VICTIM ALL OVER.

11:22.950 --> 11:25.407
THINK ABOUT THAT.

11:27.120 --> 11:29.179
I--I...

11:29.950 --> 11:31.383
I--I CAME BACK.

11:31.420 --> 11:33.217
I CAME BACK
TO HER HOUSE.

11:33.260 --> 11:36.013
BUT HE WAS LEAVIN'.
WHO WAS?

11:36.060 --> 11:38.187
SOME DUDE, MAN.
I DON'T KNOW.

11:38.230 --> 11:39.822
WHAT WAS HE WEARING?

11:39.860 --> 11:40.622
HE HAD A HOOD.

11:40.660 --> 11:44.198
WHAT COLOR WAS IT?
BLACK. BLACK HOOD.

11:45.170 --> 11:47.058
DEPUTY.

11:51.210 --> 11:52.802
HEY, DOMINO.

11:53.080 --> 11:58.040
COME HERE. IT'S OK.
I JUST WANT TO TALK TO YOU.
COME HERE.

12:04.250 --> 12:06.718
LOOK AT ME.

12:07.120 --> 12:10.055
YOU DIDN'T DO THIS,
DID YOU?

12:10.090 --> 12:11.125
MM-MMM.

12:11.160 --> 12:14.220
OK. HEY,
IF THAT'S TRUE,

12:14.260 --> 12:16.797
YOU GOTTA
HELP US OUT HERE.

12:16.830 --> 12:20.368
TALK TO ME. YOU LEFT.
YOU SAW HIM LEAVE.

12:20.400 --> 12:24.131
AND THEN WHAT?

12:24.170 --> 12:27.105
WENT IN AND...

12:27.980 --> 12:31.074
AND SHE'S LYING THERE.

12:31.110 --> 12:36.377
YOU KNOW, UM,
I NEEDED MONEY REAL BAD,

12:36.420 --> 12:39.184
SO--SHE WAS ALREADY LIKE THAT.

12:39.220 --> 12:41.882
SHE WAS LIKE WHAT?

12:41.920 --> 12:46.254
YOU KNOW. SHE WAS ALL CUT UP.

12:50.300 --> 12:54.031
SHE WAS ALL BUTCHERED UP
AND YOU ROBBED HER ANYWAY?

12:54.070 --> 12:58.564
IT AIN'T RIGHT!
IT AIN'T RIGHT! I'M SORRY!

12:58.610 --> 13:02.808
IT AIN'T RIGHT.
OH, GOD, FORGIVE ME.

13:02.850 --> 13:07.071
OH, GOD...

13:07.120 --> 13:10.180
IT AIN'T RIGHT!

13:10.220 --> 13:12.438
I'M SORRY!

13:12.490 --> 13:17.450
I'M SORRY!

13:17.490 --> 13:20.550
HE DIDN'T DO IT, SHERIFF.
WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE?

13:20.600 --> 13:24.127
HE WAS PRETTY FREAKED OUT
JUST THINKING ABOUT WHAT
WAS DONE TO ANNIE STUART.

13:24.170 --> 13:25.194
PEOPLE PRETEND.

13:25.230 --> 13:27.095
ANYBODY DELUSIONAL ENOUGH
TO EVISCERATE ANNIE STUART

13:27.140 --> 13:29.267
WOULD NOT BE LUCID ENOUGH
TO RECOUNT IT THE WAY HE DID.

13:29.300 --> 13:32.235
ALL RIGHT. I'LL HAVE HIM
TAKEN TO DETOX,

13:32.270 --> 13:33.578
AND THEN I'M GONNA
ARREST HIM FOR ROBBERY.

13:33.610 --> 13:36.272
IN THE MEANTIME,
I'D HAVE YOUR MEN CANVASS
THE NEIGHBORHOOD AGAIN,

13:36.310 --> 13:38.904
SEE IF THEY SAW A GUY
IN A HOODED SWEATSHIRT.

13:38.950 --> 13:40.941
WILL DO. LONG.

13:42.480 --> 13:44.948
CHICKEN BROCCOLI?

13:45.190 --> 13:48.614
IT'S NOT THAT I DON'T WANT TO,
IT'S JUST--

13:48.660 --> 13:49.217
WHAT'S THAT?

13:49.260 --> 13:51.251
OH, IT'S AUTOPSY REPORTS.

13:51.290 --> 13:56.091
ANNIE STUART'S BODY WAS,
UM...I CAN'T SAY IT.

13:56.130 --> 13:58.223
MISSING HER LIVER
AND STOMACH.

14:01.400 --> 14:05.234
I KNOW THAT THIS MAY SEEM LIKE
A SMALL, DARK HOLE,

14:05.270 --> 14:09.274
BUT IT'S MY OFFICE, AND I LIKE
TO KEEP I SORT OF CLEANISH.

14:09.310 --> 14:13.178
WHY ARE YOU DOING THAT AGAIN?

14:15.250 --> 14:17.616
HE'S TAKING THE BLOOD
AND ORGANS FROM THE BODIES

14:17.650 --> 14:21.586
AND PUTTING THEM
IN CYLINDRICAL CONTAINERS.

14:22.990 --> 14:24.457
IT'S ANTH ROPOPHAGY.

14:24.490 --> 14:26.321
ANTHRO WHAT WHAT?

14:26.360 --> 14:27.918
YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW.
GIVE ME THAT.

14:27.960 --> 14:32.169
I'M A BIG GIRL.
I CAN TAKE IT.

14:35.640 --> 14:40.236
LITERAL GREEK TRANSLATION
IS "MAN EATING."

14:41.680 --> 14:44.205
THE GUY'S A CANNIBAL.

14:58.030 --> 15:00.123
WE ARE LOOKING FOR
A 20- 30-YEAR-OLD MALE.

15:00.160 --> 15:02.196
THE UNSUB ENGAGES IN
ANTHROPOPHAGY.

15:02.230 --> 15:05.097
IT'S A PSYCHOTIC CONVICTION
THAT HE MUST DRINK HUMAN BLOOD

15:05.130 --> 15:06.961
AND POSSIBLY EAT HUMAN FLESH.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.935
FOR RICHARD TRENTON CHASE,
THE VAMPIRE KILLER,

15:09.970 --> 15:12.165
HE DRANK HIS VICTIMS' BLOOD
BECAUSE HE BELIEVED

15:12.210 --> 15:13.632
THAT ALIENS
HAD INVADED HIS BODY

15:13.680 --> 15:15.409
AND WERE SLOWLY
DRINKING HIS BLOOD.

15:15.440 --> 15:19.171
AND IF HE DIDN'T GET
THE BLOOD HE NEEDED...

15:20.420 --> 15:21.478
HE'D DIE.

15:21.520 --> 15:23.317
ANTHROPOPHAGY SUGGESTS

15:23.350 --> 15:25.716
SUCH AN EXTREME LEVEL
OF PSYCHOSIS

15:25.750 --> 15:26.739
AND DISORGANIZATION

15:26.790 --> 15:29.657
THAT HE COULDN'T HAVE
VENTURED VERY FAR FROM HOME

15:29.690 --> 15:30.520
TO COMMIT THESE CRIMES.

15:30.560 --> 15:33.950
THIS GUY LIVES
OR HAS LIVED IN THIS TOWN.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.228
HE KNOWS THE TERRITORY.

15:35.260 --> 15:38.058
YOU'VE ALL SEEN HIM.

15:38.100 --> 15:39.294
MAYBE AT THE BALLPARK.

15:39.330 --> 15:43.460
OR RIDING HIS BIKE HOME
FROM THE GROCERY STORE.

15:43.510 --> 15:45.239
HE WASN'T ALWAYS A THREAT.

15:45.270 --> 15:47.431
HE COULD HAVE BEEN
YOUR NEIGHBOR.

15:47.480 --> 15:50.005
HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN
YOUR FRIEND.

15:50.050 --> 15:51.472
WE THINK SOMETHING
ABOUT HIS DELUSION

15:51.510 --> 15:52.738
IS KEEPING HIM
HERE IN TOWN.

15:52.780 --> 15:54.372
SO WE'RE GONNA START
AT ANNIE STUART'S HOUSE

15:54.420 --> 15:55.671
AND WE'RE GONNA SPREAD OUT
THERE IN QUADRANTS.

15:55.720 --> 15:58.712
WE'RE GONNA ELIMINATE
ALL OF HIS HIDING PLACES.

15:58.750 --> 16:01.116
PAUL THOMPSON'S FUNERAL
IS THIS AFTERNOON.

16:01.160 --> 16:05.153
A LOT OF HIS NEIGHBORS
ARE GONNA BE THERE.

16:19.540 --> 16:22.668
SO, WE GOT SOME NAMES.

16:22.710 --> 16:25.099
FARRELL BELVEDERE, 23.

16:25.150 --> 16:26.742
HE, UH, TOOK A LITTLE
TOO MUCH LSD

16:26.780 --> 16:28.270
AND FLIPPED OUT
IN A WINN DIXIE,

16:28.320 --> 16:30.049
TORE UP A CHEESE COUNTER.

16:30.090 --> 16:31.717
SHOW MARK WARD.

16:31.750 --> 16:32.682
HE'S 21.

16:32.720 --> 16:34.381
5 COUNTS
OF PETTY LARCENY.

16:34.420 --> 16:36.388
ATTEMPTED SUICIDE,
COMMITTED FOR A YEAR,

16:36.420 --> 16:39.059
BUT NOW HE'S LIVING
BACK WITH HIS PARENTS.

16:39.090 --> 16:40.648
AND THE LAST ONE
IS OLEY MAYNOR.

16:40.700 --> 16:42.759
25. HE WAS INSTITUTIONALIZED

16:42.800 --> 16:44.427
FOR SEVERE MANIC-DEPRESSION.

16:44.470 --> 16:46.028
HE HAS VIOLENT MOOD SWINGS.

16:46.070 --> 16:50.063
WHEN HE WAS 18,
HE GOT ARRESTED FOR, UM,

16:50.110 --> 16:52.328
BITING THE HEADS
OFF CHICKENS.

16:52.370 --> 16:55.203
LIKE A CIRCUS GEEK?

16:55.240 --> 16:56.571
WELL, SURE,
I KNEW OLEY MAYNOR.

16:56.610 --> 16:57.804
HE WAS THE BEST
DEFENSIVE LINEMAN

16:57.850 --> 16:59.442
HARRINGTONVILLE HIGH'S
EVER HAD.

16:59.480 --> 17:01.744
BUT HE WAS
INSTITUTIONALIZED
YEARS AGO.

17:01.780 --> 17:03.782
HE WAS RELEASED
A FEW WEEKS AGO.

17:03.820 --> 17:05.583
I SAW HIM
JUST THE OTHER DAY.

17:05.620 --> 17:06.780
YOU SAW HIM WHERE?

17:06.820 --> 17:08.811
HE WAS WITH HIS BROTHER.

17:08.860 --> 17:09.849
AND, IN FACT,

17:09.890 --> 17:12.120
I THINK IT LOOKED LIKE
THEY DIDN'T WANT TO BE SEEN.

17:12.160 --> 17:14.299
BECAUSE HE TOOK OLEY
OUT OF THE CAR

17:14.330 --> 17:16.753
AND WENT STRAIGHT
INTO HIS HOUSE.

17:16.800 --> 17:19.394
WHEN WAS THIS,
MRS. MAYS?

17:19.870 --> 17:22.168
3 DAYS AGO.

17:29.380 --> 17:30.244
JESS?

17:30.280 --> 17:32.441
WHAT'S GOIN' ON, DON?

17:32.480 --> 17:34.573
UH, DO ME A FAVOR, JESS,

17:34.620 --> 17:38.147
UH, PUT THAT CLEAVER
DOWN, WILL YOU?

17:39.350 --> 17:41.614
FBI. WE'RE LOOKING FOR
YOUR BROTHER OLEY.

17:41.660 --> 17:43.753
WHAT FOR?

17:43.790 --> 17:44.779
WHERE IS HE, JESS?

17:44.830 --> 17:45.626
YOU KNOW DAMN WELL.

17:45.660 --> 17:47.753
WHERE HE'S BEEN
FOR THE PAST 8 YEARS.

17:47.800 --> 17:49.825
WE TALKED
TO THE HOSPITAL.

17:49.860 --> 17:51.794
WE KNOW HE'S
BEEN RELEASED.

17:53.740 --> 17:55.469
STAY OUT OF THERE.
WHAT WAS THAT?

17:55.500 --> 17:56.728
YOU GOT HIM
BACK THERE?

17:56.770 --> 17:58.203
HANG ON THERE, JESSIE.

17:58.240 --> 18:00.379
UH-UH. DON'T DO IT.

18:00.410 --> 18:01.707
JESS.

18:01.740 --> 18:03.879
DON'T EVEN
THINK ABOUT IT.

18:03.910 --> 18:06.242
LISTEN TO HIM.

18:06.280 --> 18:08.419
OLEY MAYNOR?

18:17.260 --> 18:18.887
ELLE.

18:18.930 --> 18:20.659
OLEY?

18:20.700 --> 18:23.567
PUT THAT DOWN.

18:23.600 --> 18:25.727
JESS?

18:25.770 --> 18:26.464
JESSIE?

18:26.500 --> 18:27.694
DON'T YOU TOUCH HIM.

18:27.740 --> 18:30.265
PLEASE, DON.

18:30.310 --> 18:32.801
I SAID PUT IT DOWN.
NOW.

18:32.840 --> 18:33.807
OLEY, THINK.

18:33.840 --> 18:36.229
I GOT A BULLET THAT
TRAVELS 1,500 FEET A SECOND.

18:36.280 --> 18:39.272
HOW FAST YOU THINK YOU CAN
GET TO US WITH THAT THING?

18:39.310 --> 18:40.811
LET'S GO.

18:40.850 --> 18:43.182
PUT IT DOWN.

18:52.790 --> 18:55.793
OLEY, THESE PEOPLE WILL DO
WHATEVER IT TAKES
TO SOLVE THIS THING.

18:55.830 --> 18:59.197
THEY NEED A CONFESSION.
THEN THEY'LL PIN IT ON YOU.

18:59.230 --> 18:59.969
NO.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.934
WE NEED TO PREVENT
ANOTHER KILLING.

19:01.970 --> 19:04.564
AND WE KNOW THAT OLEY
WAS RELEASED FROM
AN INSTITUTION

19:04.610 --> 19:06.168
IN RICHMOND 3 WEEKS AGO.

19:06.210 --> 19:09.202
YOU SHOULD'VE JUST
TOLD EVERYONE
I WAS HOME.

19:09.240 --> 19:11.208
JUST SHUT UP, OLEY.

19:11.250 --> 19:12.672
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.

19:12.710 --> 19:17.340
PEOPLE HAVE POKED FUN
AT MY BROTHER HIS WHOLE LIFE.

19:17.390 --> 19:19.950
OUR DAD, KIDS,

19:19.990 --> 19:21.912
EVEN TEACHERS AT SCHOOL.
WELL...

19:21.960 --> 19:24.451
THEY AREN'T GONNA DO IT
ANYMORE.

19:24.490 --> 19:26.629
YOU DON'T BELIEVE
I'M BETTER?

19:26.660 --> 19:27.695
YES, I DO.

19:27.730 --> 19:31.188
THAT'S WHY I DIDN'T
WANT TO COME BACK HOME
ANYWAY.

19:31.230 --> 19:33.960
WHY DID YOU COME BACK,
OLEY?

19:34.000 --> 19:35.695
TO SAY GOODBYE.

19:35.740 --> 19:36.934
YOU'RE LIVING WITH ME.

19:36.970 --> 19:39.359
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

19:39.410 --> 19:41.878
IT'S ALWAYS
THE SAME OLD THING.

19:41.910 --> 19:43.241
GOOD OLD OLEY--

19:43.280 --> 19:44.770
HE'S A HELL OF
A BALLPLAYER,

19:44.810 --> 19:46.869
BUT HE'S CRAZY
AS A LOON.

19:46.910 --> 19:48.218
NO.

19:48.250 --> 19:49.376
THERE ARE SPECIAL HOMES
I CAN GO TO.

19:49.420 --> 19:50.717
I DON'T NEED TO STAY HERE.

19:50.750 --> 19:52.786
I DON'T WANT YOU TO GO.

19:52.820 --> 19:53.889
I WANT TO HELP YOU.

19:53.920 --> 19:56.957
I'M TIRED OF HIDING.

19:56.990 --> 19:57.957
OLEY.

19:57.990 --> 20:00.891
YOU BEEN TAKING
YOUR MEDS?

20:00.930 --> 20:02.955
EVE RY DAY.

20:09.470 --> 20:11.199
TEST ME.

20:15.810 --> 20:18.370
* OF ROCKS AND TREES

20:18.410 --> 20:21.243
* OF SKIES AND SEAS

20:28.990 --> 20:31.288
WHAT'S WRONG?

20:31.330 --> 20:33.252
NOTHING.

20:33.300 --> 20:34.551
DO IT AGAIN, PLEASE.

20:34.600 --> 20:36.750
GRANNY, I JUST WANT
TO WATCH TV.

20:36.800 --> 20:37.869
WATCH IT?

20:37.900 --> 20:39.458
WITH A VOICE LIKE THAT,

20:39.500 --> 20:42.537
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
YOUR OWN SHOW SOMEDAY.

20:43.510 --> 20:45.967
ALL RIGHT. HA HA!

20:46.010 --> 20:48.308
TV AND COOKIES IT IS.

20:48.340 --> 20:49.876
NOW, I'LL BE BACK
IN A MINUTE.

20:49.910 --> 20:51.707
I JUST HAVE TO GET
THE COOKIES

20:51.750 --> 20:55.015
AND TEND TO THE LAUNDRY.

20:56.080 --> 21:00.312
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
I'M A HUMAN GIRL AND YOU'RE--

21:00.360 --> 21:01.918
YOU'RE A ROBOT,
A MACHINE.

21:01.960 --> 21:04.588
WHAT

21:04.630 --> 21:07.849
IT'S UP TOO LOUD,
BUDDY. TURN IT DOWN.

21:07.900 --> 21:09.390
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'M SORRY.

21:09.430 --> 21:10.465
I'LL BE RIGHT OVER,

21:10.500 --> 21:11.967
AND LET'S NOT FIGHT
EVER AGAIN.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.366
OK.
COME UP HERE
AND I'LL MEET YOU...

21:28.420 --> 21:29.239
THE NEIGHBOR
ACROSS THE STREET

21:29.280 --> 21:30.884
HEARD A CAR
SCREECH OUT OF THE DRIVEWAY,

21:30.920 --> 21:32.387
ABOUT 25 MINUTES AGO.

21:32.420 --> 21:33.352
WELL, WHOSE CAR
WAS IT?

21:33.390 --> 21:34.982
THE GRANDMOTHER'S,
ANNETTE GILES.

21:35.020 --> 21:36.009
IT'S A GOLD '72 BUICK.

21:36.060 --> 21:37.687
I ALREADY PUT THE APB
OUT ON IT.

21:37.730 --> 21:39.982
THE PARENTS JUST
GOT HOME FROM WORK.

21:40.030 --> 21:41.395
I WISH TO GOD
I'D NEVER SPOKEN TO YOU!

21:41.430 --> 21:42.590
I TOLD YOU I DIDN'T
WANT HIM INVOLVED!

21:42.630 --> 21:44.996
I ASSURE YOU
WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING
TO FIND YOUR LITTLE BOY.

21:45.030 --> 21:45.724
I WANT MY BABY BACK!

21:45.770 --> 21:46.623
HELEN, NOW, LOOK,
I WON'T SLEEP

21:46.670 --> 21:49.889
UNTIL WE FIND
LITTLE WALLY.
NOW COME ON.

21:49.940 --> 21:50.759
I KNOW. I KNOW.

21:50.810 --> 21:54.337
THE LITTLE BOY
WAS AT BOTH CRIME SCENES.

21:54.380 --> 21:56.575
THE UNSUB MIGHT HAVE BEEN
AFTER HIM ALL ALONG.

21:56.610 --> 21:59.044
I'M SURE THAT'S WHAT
MRS. BRISBANE THINKS.

21:59.080 --> 22:00.843
I WANT YOU TO TALK
TO HER WHEN SHE CALMS DOWN,

22:00.880 --> 22:02.040
SEE IF SHE CAN
COME UP WITH ANY LEADS.

22:02.080 --> 22:04.583
SHE'S NOT GONNA
WANT TO TALK TO ME.

22:04.620 --> 22:06.918
PERSUADE HER.

22:07.960 --> 22:08.915
YOU FOUND THE BODY,
RIGHT, DEPUTY?

22:08.960 --> 22:12.020
YES, SIR. IF YOU DON'T MIND,
I'LL WAIT OUT HERE.

22:12.060 --> 22:14.494
THAT'S FINE.

22:23.910 --> 22:28.574
DO YOU THINK THIS LUNATIC
WAS AFTER WALLY?

22:29.940 --> 22:32.500
PSYCHOTIC MIND...

22:32.550 --> 22:33.847
IT'S HARD TO PREDICT.

22:33.880 --> 22:38.442
MAYBE THE KID BEING
AT BOTH MURDER SCENES
WAS JUST A COINCIDENCE.

22:38.490 --> 22:41.948
HE'S ONLY 7 YEARS OLD.

22:42.820 --> 22:46.153
ANOTHER EVISCERATION.

22:46.190 --> 22:48.021
HER THROAT WAS SLASHED.

22:48.060 --> 22:51.928
THAT'S WHY NOBODY
HEARD HER SCREAM.

22:52.130 --> 22:55.133
HE SPLIT HER
RIB CAGE OPEN?

22:58.110 --> 23:00.066
WITH TH ESE.

23:06.750 --> 23:10.516
LOOKS LIKE THIS TIME
HIS TARGET WAS THE HEART.

23:10.550 --> 23:11.983
DID HE TAKE IT?

23:12.020 --> 23:14.079
YES.

23:16.690 --> 23:19.625
HE TOOK THE HEART

23:19.660 --> 23:20.820
YEAH.

23:20.860 --> 23:23.124
THE HEART HAS ALWAYS
HAD INCREDIBLE SYMBOLIC
SIGNIFICANCE.

23:23.160 --> 23:26.163
I MEAN, ASIDE FROM JUST BANAL
ROMANTIC ASSOCIATIONS.

23:26.200 --> 23:28.430
THE EGYPTIANS LEFT THE HEART
IN MUMMIES

23:28.470 --> 23:31.769
BECAUSE THEY BELIEVED
THE ORGAN ENSURED ETERNAL LIFE.

23:31.810 --> 23:33.061
SOMETHING I READ...

23:33.110 --> 23:35.032
OH, THERE IT IS--OH!

23:35.080 --> 23:36.104
SORRY. I'M SORRY.

23:36.140 --> 23:40.008
IT'S OK. GIVE ME THE BOOK.
THE BIG ONE, RIGHT THERE.

23:40.050 --> 23:43.486
OK. GET THE BOOK, PLEASE,
PENELOPE.
HERE YOU ARE. THANK YOU.

23:43.520 --> 23:44.782
WHERE'S THE CRIME SCENE
PHOTOS?

23:44.820 --> 23:47.482
CRIME SCENE PHOTOS
ARE RIGHT HERE, SIR.

23:47.520 --> 23:49.852
CRIME SCENE PHOTOS.

23:49.890 --> 23:53.894
DOES THE BODY
LOOK LIKE AN ANGEL?

23:53.930 --> 23:54.954
NOT TO ME.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.560
SCAN THIS IN
AND SEND IT TO THEM.

23:57.600 --> 24:00.797
THERE WAS--
THERE WAS AN ARTICLE

24:00.840 --> 24:02.796
BY A CAMBRIDGE PROFESSOR.

24:02.840 --> 24:04.205
IT SEEMS THAT, UH,

24:04.240 --> 24:06.731
ALL THE ORGANS
THE UNSUB'S TAKEN--

24:06.770 --> 24:08.977
STOMACH, LIVER,
NOW THE HEART--

24:09.010 --> 24:12.241
WERE THOUGHT TO BE
THE SEAT OF THE SOUL

24:12.280 --> 24:14.145
AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER.

24:14.180 --> 24:15.875
THEN HE DRINKS THEIR BLOOD?

24:15.920 --> 24:19.083
SO WHEN THIS MAN DRINKS
HIS VICTIMS' BLOOD...

24:19.120 --> 24:21.680
HE BELIEVES HE'S
ENCOUNTERING THE DIVINE.

24:21.720 --> 24:25.520
WAIT A MINUTE.
NONE OF THIS EXPLAINS
WHY HE TOOK THE KID.

24:25.560 --> 24:27.187
WELL, THE, UH,

24:27.230 --> 24:30.154
UNSUB MADE THE VICTIM
INTO AN ANGEL.

24:30.200 --> 24:31.360
MAYBE THE KID'S
A MESSIANIC FIGURE.

24:31.400 --> 24:35.029
LET'S JUST HOPE
HE DOESN'T FEEL THE NEED
TO SACRIFICE HIM.

24:35.070 --> 24:39.109
YOU STAY HERE,
CHARLIE.
I WON'T BE LONG.

24:55.860 --> 24:57.725
HI.
YOU'VE REACHED THE HOME

24:57.760 --> 24:59.227
OF ANNIE, DAVID,
AND CHARLIE STUART.

24:59.260 --> 25:00.181
PLEASE LEAVE A MESSAGE
AFTER THE TONE

25:00.230 --> 25:03.256
AND WE'LL GET BACK TO YOU
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

25:04.500 --> 25:08.596
DAVID, IT'S MAGGIE.
I'M SO SORRY ABOUT YOUR WIFE.

25:08.640 --> 25:09.459
COULD YOU GIVE US A CALL

25:09.500 --> 25:10.364
AND TELL US WHAT
TIME THE SERVICES ARE?

25:10.400 --> 25:13.164
AND PLEASE KNOW YOU'RE IN
OUR PRAYERS.

25:15.580 --> 25:17.639
HE MUST HAVE COME BY
BETWEEN PATROLS.

25:17.680 --> 25:19.841
NOW, JACKIE,
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

25:19.880 --> 25:22.644
WELL, WHAT THE HELL
IS IT?

25:23.920 --> 25:26.115
IT'S A HUMAN STOMACH.

25:26.150 --> 25:27.082
OH, MY GOD.

25:27.120 --> 25:29.008
YOU MEAN DAVE'S WIFE?

25:29.060 --> 25:30.618
WE CAN ONLY ASSUME.

25:30.660 --> 25:32.958
NOW, NONE OF THE NEIGHBORS
SAW ANYTHING?

25:32.990 --> 25:35.652
WELL, WE TALKED TO MISS WADE
ACROSS THE ROAD. NOTHING.

25:35.700 --> 25:37.622
AND THE MAYNARDS
AREN'T EVEN HOME.

25:37.670 --> 25:38.728
ALL RIGHT.

25:38.770 --> 25:39.964
WE NEED A 24-HOUR
WATCH HERE

25:40.000 --> 25:43.709
AND AT THE OTHER
CRIME SCENES, TOO.
GO ON.

25:44.910 --> 25:45.968
NOW, AGENT HOTCHNER,

25:46.010 --> 25:47.238
I NEED TO BE VERY CLEAR HERE.

25:47.270 --> 25:51.900
RIGHT NOW ALL WE GOT
IS SOME THEORY ABOUT
A RELIGIOUS DELUSION.

25:51.950 --> 25:54.271
I MEAN, HOW THE HELL
DO YOU EXPLAIN THAT?

25:54.320 --> 25:58.347
SOMETIMES DISORGANIZED
KILLERS RETURN BODY PARTS
TO THE GRAVE SITES.

25:58.390 --> 26:00.244
IT MIGHT BE NOTHING.
IT MIGHT JUST BE A WAY

26:00.290 --> 26:03.657
FOR HIM TO MANIPULATE
THE BODY EVEN AFTER DEATH.

26:03.690 --> 26:07.251
BUT IT MAY ALSO BE
AN ACT OF REMORSE.

26:07.290 --> 26:10.191
EVEN IN THE MOST EXTREME
PSYCHOTIC EPISODES

26:10.230 --> 26:12.960
THERE ARE VARIATIONS
IN LUCIDITY,

26:13.000 --> 26:14.262
DEGREES
OF INSIGHTFULNESS.

26:14.300 --> 26:16.336
IF I'M COMING OUT OF
A DELUSION...

26:16.370 --> 26:19.339
JUST KILLED SOMEONE
AND DRANK THEIR BLOOD...

26:19.370 --> 26:21.679
AND I'M STARTING
TO FEEL BAD ABOUT IT...

26:21.710 --> 26:22.608
WHERE DO I GO?

26:22.640 --> 26:26.007
SHERIFF, HOW MANY CHURCHES
ARE IN THIS TOWN?

26:26.050 --> 26:30.168
GENTLEMEN, THIS IS
THE BIBLE BELT. MAYBE 15.

26:30.220 --> 26:32.245
I WOULD POST AN OFFICER
AT EVERY SINGLE ONE.

26:32.290 --> 26:35.259
CALL IN AUXILIARY COPS
IF YOU HAVE THEM.

26:35.290 --> 26:36.951
ALL RIGHT.
YOU GOT IT.

26:36.990 --> 26:39.823
LONG, GET ON THE PHONE
WITH ME.

26:39.860 --> 26:42.226
4 CHURCHES IN 4 BLOCKS.

26:42.260 --> 26:45.889
EVER FEEL LIKE WE JUST
STEPPED INTO MAYBERRY?

26:45.930 --> 26:49.161
MAYBERRY WITH A PSYCHOTIC
KILLER RUNNING AROUND.

26:49.200 --> 26:51.361
THERE'S THAT.

26:53.370 --> 26:54.200
HEY, DEREK.

26:54.240 --> 26:58.745
DOES THAT LOOK LIKE
A '72 BUICK TO YOU?

26:59.450 --> 27:02.977
YES, IT DOES.

27:13.430 --> 27:15.728
FBI! DON'T MOVE!

27:15.760 --> 27:16.852
DON'T MOVE! GET DOWN!

27:16.900 --> 27:17.525
GET ON YOUR KNEES!

27:17.560 --> 27:19.164
GET ON YOUR KNEES!
GET DOWN!

27:19.200 --> 27:21.088
HANDS ON YOUR HEAD!
LET'S GO!

27:21.140 --> 27:23.392
HANDS ON YOUR HEAD!

27:23.440 --> 27:27.365
YOU GOT IT?
DON'T MOVE!

27:31.280 --> 27:32.144
DEREK.

27:32.180 --> 27:33.306
I THINK WE GOT OUR GUY.

27:55.240 --> 27:58.334
HIS NAME'S EDDY MAYS,
21 YEARS OLD.

27:58.370 --> 27:59.234
DO YOU KNOW HIM?

27:59.270 --> 28:02.137
YEAH. I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE
A BOY LIKE EDDY

28:02.180 --> 28:03.772
WOULD DO SOMETHING
LIKE THIS.

28:03.810 --> 28:05.448
HE WAS THE NICEST KID
YOU EVER SAW.

28:05.480 --> 28:07.072
HE'S MENTALLY ILL,
SHERIFF.

28:07.110 --> 28:10.785
A BOY LIKE EDDY MAYS
COULD TRULY USE
AN INSANITY PLEA

28:10.820 --> 28:11.809
IN A COURT OF LAW.

28:11.850 --> 28:13.147
YOU KNOW, THE IRONIC THING
ABOUT PSYCHOTIC ILLNESS

28:13.190 --> 28:17.081
IS GENERALLY THEY'RE
LESS VIOLENT THAN
THE REST OF THE POPULATION.

28:17.120 --> 28:18.985
BY THE NATURE
OF PSYCHOTIC DELUSIONS,

28:19.030 --> 28:21.419
WHEN THEY DO GET VIOLENT...

28:22.330 --> 28:24.389
WE'RE NEVER GONNA GET
ANYWHERE WITH HIM.

28:24.430 --> 28:27.092
I CAN'T!
I CAN'T!
NOT LIKE THIS.

28:27.130 --> 28:28.461
LOOK AT THE GUY.

28:29.670 --> 28:32.036
YOU CAN'T READ HIM IS RIGHTS.
YOU CAN'T EVEN PROCESS HIM.

28:32.070 --> 28:33.230
I BETTER CALL HIS MOTHER.

28:33.270 --> 28:36.137
IT'S A DAMN SHAME.
HIS DADDY DIED JUST
A COUPLE YEARS AGO.

28:36.180 --> 28:38.478
THIS IS GONNA FALL
AWFUL HARD ON HER.

28:38.510 --> 28:40.046
WHAT'S THE FAMILY LIKE?

28:40.080 --> 28:41.968
DAD WAS A DOCTOR,

28:42.020 --> 28:43.009
AND MARY GWATHMEY MAYS

28:43.050 --> 28:46.816
COMES FROM ONE OF THE OLDEST
FAMILIES IN TENNESSEE.

28:46.850 --> 28:48.078
I'D LIKE TO MEET HER.

28:48.120 --> 28:50.179
WE ALREADY HAVE.

28:51.060 --> 28:54.518
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

28:54.560 --> 28:57.893
IT'S JUST--IT'S...

28:57.930 --> 28:59.090
SO HORRIBLE.

28:59.130 --> 29:01.792
I--I--IF THERE WAS
ANYTHING I COULD HAVE
DONE TO STOP HIM.

29:01.840 --> 29:03.364
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
HE WAS IN TOWN.

29:03.400 --> 29:07.268
ARE YOU AWARE OF HOW
SICK YOUR SON IS?

29:09.380 --> 29:10.904
HE HAD SOME TROUBLE,

29:10.950 --> 29:13.100
UH, ADJUSTING TO SCHOOL.

29:13.150 --> 29:15.345
THERE WAS AN INCIDENT
LAST YEAR.

29:15.380 --> 29:16.517
WE GOT HIM SOME HELP.

29:16.550 --> 29:20.042
MRS. MAYS, ACTUALLY
THERE IS A WAY
THAT YOU CAN HELP US.

29:20.090 --> 29:20.818
ANYTHING.

29:20.860 --> 29:22.816
WE BELIEVE YOUR SON
HAS KIDNAPPED

29:22.860 --> 29:24.122
A 7-YEAR-OLD BOY--

29:24.160 --> 29:25.320
WALLY BRISBANE.

29:25.360 --> 29:26.281
OH, LORD GOD.

29:26.330 --> 29:28.025
AND HE DOESN'T REMEMBER
WHAT HE DID WITH HIM,

29:28.060 --> 29:29.254
BUT IF WE WERE ABLE
TO GIVE HIM

29:29.300 --> 29:31.063
SOME ANTI-PSYCHOTIC
MEDICATION,

29:31.100 --> 29:32.294
HE MAY BECOME MORE LUCID.

29:32.330 --> 29:34.890
THAT'S CHILD'S PARENTS
MUST BE DEVASTATED.

29:34.940 --> 29:36.168
RIGHT NOW EDDY
IS NON COMPOS MENTIS,

29:36.200 --> 29:39.033
BUT IF YOU WERE TO SIGN
A MEDICAL CONSENT FORM,

29:39.070 --> 29:41.174
WE COULD GIVE HIM
THE INJECTION.

29:41.210 --> 29:42.871
OF COURSE.

29:44.180 --> 29:48.048
I JUST PRAY
THAT CHILD IS ALL RIGHT.

29:51.620 --> 29:52.609
HEY, GARCIA.
TALK TO ME.

29:52.650 --> 29:55.016
OK. SO I GOT AHOLD OF
EDDY'S ROOMMATE IN COLLEGE,

29:55.060 --> 29:58.086
WHO DESCRIBES EDDY AS HAVING
AN OVERPROTECT IVE MOM.

29:58.130 --> 29:58.880
HOW OVERPROTECT IVE?

29:58.930 --> 30:00.283
SHE CALLED HIM, LIKE,
3 TIMES A DAY.

30:00.330 --> 30:02.218
AND GET THIS--ONE TIME
SHE WENT UP TO BOSTON

30:02.260 --> 30:05.024
TO BREAK HIM UP
WITH A GIRLFRIEND
SHE DIDN'T LIKE.

30:05.070 --> 30:06.219
WOW.
YEAH. YEAH.

30:06.270 --> 30:08.465
IT SEEMS LIKE EDDY'S
ENTIRE COLLEGE EXPERIENCE

30:08.500 --> 30:11.105
WAS SOME SORT OF
POST-ADOLESCENT REBELLION.

30:11.140 --> 30:13.233
HE PARTIED LIKE
AN EIGHTIES CLUBBER.

30:13.270 --> 30:16.205
HE SUFFERED A DELUSIONAL BREAK
DUE TO METHAMPHETAMINE

30:16.240 --> 30:17.207
AND ROCK COCAINE CONSUMPTION.

30:17.240 --> 30:19.401
WOW, THAT IS PARTYING
LIKE AN EIGHTIES CLUBBER.

30:19.450 --> 30:22.339
RIGHT. SO THEN, UH,
HE WAS ADMITTED TO
A MENTAL HEALTH FACILITY

30:22.380 --> 30:24.280
IN BOSTON.
CHECKED HIMSELF OUT

30:24.320 --> 30:26.140
A WEEK AGO AND THEN
FOUND HIS WAY HOME.

30:26.190 --> 30:27.248
WHAT WAS HIS MAJOR?

30:27.290 --> 30:30.111
COMPARATIVE RELIGION.

30:30.490 --> 30:31.252
THAN KS.

30:31.290 --> 30:33.326
UM, HOW IS IT
HAVING GIDEON AROUND?

30:33.360 --> 30:36.625
UH, YOU CAN HAVE HIM BACK
WHENEVER YOU'D LIKE.

30:41.170 --> 30:43.161
DUDE!
HEY.

30:43.200 --> 30:43.768
DUDE?

30:43.800 --> 30:45.461
OK, YOU'RE
WAY TOO TENSE.

30:45.510 --> 30:46.909
NO, I'M NOT.

30:46.940 --> 30:48.168
YES, YOU ARE.

30:48.210 --> 30:49.234
YOU GOT ANYTHING?

30:49.280 --> 30:50.531
YEAH. MRS. MAYS
DEFINITELY HAS

30:50.580 --> 30:51.979
OBSESSIVE-COM PU LSIVE
DISORDER.

30:52.010 --> 30:55.446
HER HOUSE LOOKS LIKE
A HOME DECORATING CATALOG.

30:58.220 --> 30:58.914
YOU?

30:58.950 --> 30:59.712
I CHECKED EVERY
NOOK AND CRANNY,

30:59.750 --> 31:01.980
ALL 8 BEDROOMS,
FIREPLACES. NOTHING.

31:02.020 --> 31:03.510
NO EVIDENCE OF MURDER,
NO SIGN OF THE BOY.

31:03.560 --> 31:08.327
IF EDDY MAYS DID COME HERE,
HE WAS VERY CAREFUL
NOT TO LEAVE ANYTHING BEHIND.

31:09.300 --> 31:11.063
DO YOU SMELL THAT?

31:12.330 --> 31:14.195
YEAH.
IT SMELLS LIKE BLEACH.

31:14.240 --> 31:16.367
A LOT OF BLEACH.

31:20.640 --> 31:23.006
DEREK.

31:24.550 --> 31:28.042
MM-HMM.
IT'S JUST WAY TOO CLEAN.

31:37.590 --> 31:39.319
ELLE.

31:44.200 --> 31:47.465
LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY
MISSED A SPOT.

31:47.500 --> 31:50.389
YEP.

31:52.640 --> 31:55.700
AAH!

32:09.160 --> 32:12.220
I'VE ADMINISTERED
THE HALOPERIDOL
TO MR. MAYS.

32:12.260 --> 32:13.488
HOW LONG UNTIL
IT TAKES EFFECT?

32:13.530 --> 32:14.326
IT'S COMING ON NOW.

32:14.360 --> 32:16.351
FULL EFFECT IN ABOUT
15 MINUTES OR SO.

32:16.400 --> 32:18.027
YOU HAVE TO REALIZE
THAT WHILE THE DRUG

32:18.070 --> 32:19.094
WILL MAKE HIM APPEAR
TO BE ASYMPTOMATIC,

32:19.130 --> 32:22.236
IT WILL NOT NECESSARILY
REMOVE HIS DELUSIONAL STATE.

32:22.270 --> 32:23.339
WILL IT MAKE HIM
MORE LUCID?

32:23.370 --> 32:25.304
POSSIBLY. BUT LET ME
MAKE THIS CLEAR.

32:25.340 --> 32:29.037
I GAVE HIM THE SHOT
BECAUSE HE NEEDED
TO BE MEDICATED,

32:29.080 --> 32:30.274
NOT SO YOU COULD
AGITATE HIM

32:30.310 --> 32:31.971
BY PUTTING HIM THROUGH
AN INTERROGATION.

32:32.010 --> 32:33.375
THAT BOY NEEDS TO BE
HOSPITALIZED.

32:33.410 --> 32:35.071
WELL, A JURY
MIGHT AGREE WITH YOU,

32:35.120 --> 32:36.576
BUT RIGHT NOW HE NEEDS
TO ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS

32:36.620 --> 32:41.216
'CAUSE THERE'S A LITTLE BOY
WE NEED TO FIND. THANK YOU.

33:03.410 --> 33:05.708
HEY, EDDY.

33:05.750 --> 33:08.218
DO YOU KNOW
WHERE YOU ARE?

33:10.050 --> 33:11.312
JAIL.

33:11.350 --> 33:13.147
THAT'S RIGHT.

33:13.190 --> 33:15.385
DO YOU KNOW WHY?

33:15.420 --> 33:16.512
I WAS VERY BAD.

33:16.560 --> 33:18.380
BEFORE, I WAS VERY BAD.

33:18.430 --> 33:23.356
BUT I'M--I'M MUCH BETTER
NOW, MUCH...

33:23.400 --> 33:25.459
MUCH BETTER.

33:25.500 --> 33:28.492
EDDY, DO YOU REMEMBER
HURTING ANYONE?

33:31.440 --> 33:34.034
WHERE DID YOU GO
TO COLLEGE, EDDY?

33:34.080 --> 33:36.105
MM. BOSTON.

33:36.140 --> 33:37.368
DID YOU LIKE BOSTON?

33:37.410 --> 33:38.479
MM-MMM. NO.

33:38.510 --> 33:39.477
I DON'T KNOW.

33:39.510 --> 33:43.139
WHAT WAS YOUR FAVORITE THING
ABOUT BOSTON, EDDY?

33:45.350 --> 33:47.318
HARVARD--I WENT
TO HARVARD SQUARE.

33:47.350 --> 33:49.113
I HAD CAPPUCCINO.

33:49.160 --> 33:51.378
CAPPUCCINO.

33:52.360 --> 33:55.557
EDDY, DO YOU REMEMBER WALLY?

34:00.170 --> 34:02.229
I KNOW THE BRISBANES.

34:02.270 --> 34:06.263
YOU TOOK THIS LITTLE BOY.

34:08.810 --> 34:10.505
NO.

34:11.750 --> 34:14.344
NO. I DID NOT...

34:14.380 --> 34:16.371
I DID NOT DO THAT.

34:16.420 --> 34:17.819
EDDY, I UNDERSTAND
YOU'RE UNCOMFORTABLE.

34:17.850 --> 34:22.253
YOUR--YOUR HANDS ARE CUT UP.
YOUR ARMS ARE BRUISED. IS--

34:22.290 --> 34:25.088
DO YOU KNOW WHY?

34:25.130 --> 34:25.824
YEAH.

34:25.860 --> 34:28.556
YOU KILLED 3 PEOPLE,
EDDY.

34:30.700 --> 34:34.192
YOU KILLED 3 PEOPLE,
EDDY.

34:34.540 --> 34:36.838
YOU KILLED 3 PEOPLE,
EDDY.

34:40.340 --> 34:43.377
PAUL THOMPSON.

34:47.450 --> 34:49.441
ANNIE STUART.

34:53.590 --> 34:55.649
LYNETTE GILES.

35:00.660 --> 35:03.527
[PANTING[
NO! NO! STOP IT!

35:03.560 --> 35:05.494
YOU WILL--
YOU WILL BE PUNISHED.
GOD IS PUNISHING YOU.

35:05.530 --> 35:10.229
NO, NO, NO. I BROUGHT
YOU AN ANGEL. SEE?

35:10.270 --> 35:12.807
NO, I DO NOT SEE.
I DO NOT SEE.

35:12.840 --> 35:16.276
PLEASE. PLEASE.

35:16.310 --> 35:17.436
PLEASE!

35:17.480 --> 35:19.675
I BROUGHT YOU
AN ANGEL.

35:19.710 --> 35:21.143
PLEASE.

35:21.180 --> 35:23.614
TAKE IT.

35:25.220 --> 35:27.211
I JUST WANT TO KNOW.

35:27.250 --> 35:30.185
WHEN WILL YOU
LEAVE ME ALONE?!

35:30.220 --> 35:32.654
WE NEED HIM TO TELL US
WHERE THAT BOY IS.

35:32.690 --> 35:33.520
SHERIFF,

35:33.560 --> 35:34.527
WE'RE NOT GONNA GET
ANYTHING OUT OF HIM

35:34.560 --> 35:36.858
UNTIL HE GETS THIS LATEST
EPISODE UNDER CONTROL.

35:36.900 --> 35:38.299
AGENT HOTCHNER,
IT'S GETTING COLD AND DARK.

35:38.330 --> 35:42.391
IF THAT BRISBANE BOY'S
ANYWHERE OUTSIDE, HE WON'T
STAND A CHANCE IN HELL.

35:42.440 --> 35:45.705
YOU ALL! HURRY UP DOWN HERE!

36:01.490 --> 36:02.514
COME ON!

36:11.630 --> 36:13.689
WHY WEREN'T YOU STRAIGHT
WITH US, MRS. MAYS?

36:13.730 --> 36:14.799
STRAIGHT WITH YOU?

36:14.840 --> 36:16.865
YOU NEVER TOLD US
YOUR SON WAS IN
A MENTAL HOSPITAL.

36:16.900 --> 36:18.800
I SPOKE WITH A DOCTOR
AT A FACILITY IN BOSTON.

36:18.840 --> 36:19.807
HE SAID EDDY WAS RELEASED

36:19.840 --> 36:22.809
A WEEK AGO AND THAT
HE CALLED YOU TO PICK HIM UP

36:22.840 --> 36:23.670
AND THAT YOU NEVER CAME.

36:23.710 --> 36:26.599
YOU ASKED ME IF I KNEW
IF HE'D COME HOME,

36:26.650 --> 36:27.776
AND I DIDN'T.

36:27.810 --> 36:29.539
I--I THOUGHT
HE WAS IN BOSTON.

36:29.580 --> 36:32.788
THERE WAS ALSO BLOOD
ON THE FLOOR
OF YOUR UTILITY ROOM.

36:32.820 --> 36:35.254
DO YOU HAVE ANY
EXPLANATION FOR THAT?

36:35.290 --> 36:37.508
WELL, SOMETIMES
I CUT MY LEGS

36:37.560 --> 36:38.857
WHEN I PRUNE
THE ROSES.

36:38.890 --> 36:40.551
YOU PRUNE YOUR ROSES
IN WINTER?

36:40.590 --> 36:41.955
AS A MATTER OF FACT, I DO.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.251
WHEN DO YOU PRUNE YOURS?

36:43.300 --> 36:44.528
MRS. MAYS,
I UNDERSTAND

36:44.570 --> 36:45.468
THAT YOU MAY WANT TO DO
EVERYTHING YOU CAN
TO PROTECT YOUR SON,

36:45.500 --> 36:47.365
BUT THAT LITTLE BOY
MAY BE DYING RIGHT NOW.

36:47.400 --> 36:49.334
I WOULD LIKE
TO HELP YOU.
I REALLY WOULD.

36:49.370 --> 36:52.430
BUT RIGHT NOW,
I'VE GOT TO SEE
ABOUT MY SON.

36:52.470 --> 36:56.372
I THINK IT'S BETTER
IF YOU STAY HERE.

37:03.320 --> 37:04.514
SHE'S DEFINITELY LYING.

37:04.550 --> 37:06.882
I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT SHE'S LYING ABOUT,
BUT SHE'S LYING.

37:06.920 --> 37:09.753
YOU DON'T THINK SHE'D
LET THAT BOY DIE
TO SAVE HER SON, DO YOU?

37:09.790 --> 37:10.415
I DON'T KNOW.

37:10.460 --> 37:12.348
SHE DRIVES A CADILLAC,
RIGHT?

37:12.390 --> 37:13.322
YEAH.

37:13.360 --> 37:15.021
THEY GOT GPSs IN THEM.

37:15.060 --> 37:16.254
SO...

37:16.300 --> 37:18.621
SO LET'S GO SEE
WHERE SHE'S BEEN.

37:19.870 --> 37:22.430
IT'S GOT EVERY STOP
SHE'S MADE

37:22.470 --> 37:23.789
AND HOW LONG
SHE SPENT THERE.

37:23.840 --> 37:29.278
YOU KNOW, THESE THINGS
COULD CAUSE MORE DIVORCES
THAN INTERNET PORN.

37:29.310 --> 37:30.675
HEY, LOOK AT THAT.

37:30.710 --> 37:31.677
THAT'S INTERESTING.

37:31.710 --> 37:34.349
SHE STOPPED
AT THE SAME PLACE
ON ROUTE 3

37:34.380 --> 37:35.449
LIKE 6 TIMES.

37:35.480 --> 37:36.242
HELL, LET'S GET MARY

37:36.280 --> 37:37.542
AND TAKE HER TO HER SPOT
ON ROUTE 3.

37:37.580 --> 37:40.310
WE CAN TELL HER
THAT WE'RE GOING TO
VISIT EDDY IN THE HOSPITAL.

37:40.350 --> 37:42.318
OK.

37:42.360 --> 37:45.488
HOW LONG HAVE YOU LIVED
IN HARRINGTONVILLE?

37:45.530 --> 37:47.725
ALL MY LIFE.

37:47.760 --> 37:50.422
MY ANCESTORS
HAVE BEEN THERE

37:50.460 --> 37:52.428
SINCE THE LATE
18th CENTURY.

37:52.470 --> 37:54.631
PLUS I WENT TO SCHOOL
IN VIRGINIA.

37:54.670 --> 37:56.991
BUT ASIDE FROM THAT,
I'VE LIVED RIGHT HERE.

37:57.040 --> 38:00.009
THIS IS NOT THE WAY
TO THE HOSPITAL.

38:00.040 --> 38:01.769
I'VE GOT TO MAKE
A QUICK STOP FIRST.

38:01.810 --> 38:03.573
WHERE DID YOU GO
TO SCHOOL?

38:03.610 --> 38:05.578
HIGH SCHOOL,
ST. CATHERINE'S HALL.

38:05.610 --> 38:06.645
COLLEGE, SWEET BRIAR.

38:06.680 --> 38:09.319
YOU WERE
A SWEET BRIAR VIXEN?

38:09.350 --> 38:10.715
YOU KNOW SWEET BRIAR?

38:10.750 --> 38:12.547
MY MOTHER WENT
TO MARY BALDWIN.

38:12.590 --> 38:13.943
SHE'S FROM VIRGINIA?

38:13.990 --> 38:14.809
MANASSAS.

38:14.860 --> 38:16.384
I'VE VISITED BOTH
STAUNTON AND MANASSAS,

38:16.420 --> 38:18.354
AND I KNOW
WHERE YOUR MOTHER'S FROM.

38:18.390 --> 38:20.756
ARE WE DRIVING
OUT OF TOWN?

38:20.790 --> 38:21.757
MARY GWATHMEY MAYS.

38:21.800 --> 38:24.689
GWATHMEY'S AN OLD
TIDEWATER FAMILY,
ISN'T IT?

38:24.730 --> 38:26.618
WHERE ARE WE GOING?

38:26.670 --> 38:28.558
OLD SOUTH. OLD MONEY.

38:28.600 --> 38:30.488
A LOT OF TRADITION THERE.

38:30.540 --> 38:32.667
A LOT OF REPUTATION
TO PROTECT.

38:32.710 --> 38:33.802
EXCUSE ME?

38:33.840 --> 38:35.501
MARY, I DON'T THINK
THAT YOU WERE PROTECTING
YOUR SON.

38:35.540 --> 38:38.031
I THINK YOU WERE
PROTECTING YOURSELF.

38:38.080 --> 38:39.604
FROM THE SHAME,
THE HUMILIATION

38:39.650 --> 38:43.108
OF PEOPLE FINDING OUT
THAT HE WAS MENTALLY ILL.

38:43.150 --> 38:48.816
YOU DIDN'T VISIT HIM
IN THE HOSPITAL
IN 6 MONTHS. NOT ONCE.

38:50.390 --> 38:52.449
WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?

38:52.490 --> 38:55.459
WE CHECKED THE GPS DEVICE
IN YOUR CAR.

38:55.500 --> 38:59.129
YOU STOPPED HER 6 TIMES
IN LESS THAN 2 HOURS.

38:59.170 --> 39:01.991
THERE ARE A DOZEN OFFICERS
ON THEIR WAY OVER HERE

39:02.040 --> 39:02.734
WITH A PACK OF DOGS,

39:02.770 --> 39:04.362
AND WE WILL FIND
THAT LITTLE BOY.

39:04.410 --> 39:07.868
IT WOULD BE
IN YOUR BEST INTEREST
TO HELP US.

39:34.570 --> 39:37.164
WE'RE COMING FOR YOU,
WALLY!

39:37.200 --> 39:39.509
HANG ON, WALLY!

39:46.210 --> 39:49.418
COME HERE. COME HERE.
IT'S OK.

39:49.450 --> 39:51.839
COME ON, BOY.
COME ON.

39:55.960 --> 39:58.656
OH, BABY! OHH!

39:58.860 --> 40:02.751
LET'S GET YOU HOME.
COME ON.

40:06.230 --> 40:09.131
MR. HOTCHNER.

40:10.700 --> 40:12.702
DO YOU HAVE CHILDREN?

40:12.740 --> 40:13.638
YES, I DO.

40:13.670 --> 40:15.501
IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU WOULDN'T DO FOR THEM?

40:15.540 --> 40:19.146
I WOULDN'T CLEAN
THE BLOOD OF THEIR VICTIMS
OFF THE FLOOR.

40:19.180 --> 40:22.149
I DIDN'T KNOW MY SON
WAS KILLING ANYONE

40:22.180 --> 40:23.647
UNTIL HE BROUGHT HOME
THAT BOY.

40:23.680 --> 40:26.979
YOU KNOW, MARY,
SOMETIMES WHAT WE
DON'T DO...

40:27.020 --> 40:29.557
IS EVERY BIT
AS POWERFUL
AS WHAT WE DO.

40:29.590 --> 40:30.659
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

40:30.690 --> 40:32.123
I UNDERSTAND THAT
YOUR SON WAS DROWNING

40:32.160 --> 40:33.718
AND YOU MADE NO EFFORT
TO SAVE HIM.

40:33.760 --> 40:36.797
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT I DID.

40:36.830 --> 40:38.195
I KNOW WHAT
YOU DIDN'T DO.

40:38.230 --> 40:40.528
YOU DIDN'T
CALL THE POLICE.

40:40.570 --> 40:42.094
AND EVERY DAY
OF YOUR LIFE

40:42.140 --> 40:43.869
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
ASK YOURSELF

40:43.900 --> 40:45.037
WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED

40:45.070 --> 40:47.630
IF YOU'D GONE TO BOSTON
TO HELP HIM.

40:47.670 --> 40:51.777
EDDY TOLD ME HE WAS
BRINGING ME AN ANGEL.

40:52.780 --> 40:57.217
I--I WANTED TO PROTECT
MY SON.

40:57.980 --> 40:59.811
WHAT ELSE
WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO?

40:59.850 --> 41:03.809
ALMOST ANYTHING
WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER.

41:09.230 --> 41:11.767
MRS. MAYS.

41:17.800 --> 41:20.132
HARRIET BEECHER STOWE
ONCE SAID,

41:20.170 --> 41:22.730
"THE BITTEREST TEARS
SHED OVER GRAVES

41:22.780 --> 41:24.907
"ARE FOR WORDS LEFT UNSAID

41:24.950 --> 41:28.818
AND DEEDS LEFT UNDONE."

41:28.850 --> 41:29.578
GOOD JOB.

41:29.620 --> 41:32.088
NICE WORK, EVERYBODY,
BY THE WAY.

41:32.120 --> 41:33.144
THANK YOU.

41:33.190 --> 41:34.953
NOW I GET TO GO BACK
TO THE 15 FOLDERS
ON MY DESK.

41:34.990 --> 41:36.059
WAIT A MINUTE.
15? I HAVE 24.

41:36.090 --> 41:38.729
THAT'S 'CAUSE I
SLIPPED YOU 4 OF MINE.

41:38.760 --> 41:40.682
WHAT?
ON FRIDAY. YEAH. MM-HMM.

41:40.730 --> 41:41.719
HEY, SWEETH EART.

41:41.760 --> 41:42.624
DO NOT SWEETHEART ME.

41:42.660 --> 41:45.026
I MAY NOT BE
A SUPERVISORY
SPECIAL AGENT,

41:45.070 --> 41:46.867
BUT THAT DOES NOT
MAKE ME A MAID.

41:46.900 --> 41:47.889
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

41:47.930 --> 41:48.589
WHAT DO I MEAN?

41:48.640 --> 41:50.267
THIS IS THE THIRD
BOX OF CRAP

41:50.300 --> 41:51.528
THAT GIDEON LEFT
IN MY OFFICE,

41:51.570 --> 41:54.061
THERE'S AT LEAST 2 MORE,
AND EVERYTHING SMELLS
LIKE SOY SAUCE.

41:54.110 --> 41:55.236
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

41:55.280 --> 41:57.999
THANK YOU.

42:00.780 --> 42:03.214
HEY. I BELIEVE...

42:03.250 --> 42:06.549
THESE ARE YOURS.

42:06.590 --> 42:08.785
I KNEW THE CRUTCHES
WOULDN'T LAST LONG.

42:08.820 --> 42:10.219
OH, I'D RATHER LIMP.

42:10.260 --> 42:11.454
I'LL BE FINE.

42:11.490 --> 42:14.653
WELL, YOU MANAGED TO
GET ON GARCIA'S NERVES
PRETTY THOROUGHLY.

42:14.700 --> 42:15.496
WHO'S GARCIA?

42:15.530 --> 42:17.828
PENELOPE WITH THE GLASSES.

42:17.860 --> 42:19.623
IN THE ROOM
WITH THE SCREENS?

42:19.670 --> 42:21.023
SHE'S GREAT.
YEAH.

42:21.070 --> 42:22.833
YEAH. YOU MIGHT WANT TO...

42:22.870 --> 42:26.237
SEND HER A BASKET
OR SOMETHING.

42:26.270 --> 42:27.669
YEAH.

42:27.710 --> 42:30.008
IS THAT YOUR LIST?

42:30.740 --> 42:31.968
YEAH.

42:32.810 --> 42:36.109
25 THINGS I WANT TO DO
BEFORE I DIE.

42:36.150 --> 42:37.117
WHERE ARE YOU?

42:37.150 --> 42:40.347
WELL, SEEING THE WHITE SOX
WIN THE SERIES AND...

42:41.790 --> 42:42.711
SKYDIVING.

42:42.760 --> 42:43.818
THAT'S 23 AND 24,

42:43.860 --> 42:46.055
SO I GUESS I NEED
A NEW LIST.

42:46.090 --> 42:49.127
NOT TILL YOU DO 'EM ALL.

42:54.800 --> 42:57.689
HE DIDN'T WANT
TO HEAR FROM ME.

43:00.840 --> 43:03.968
YOU DON'T KNOW
TILL YOU TRY.

43:28.370 --> 43:29.792
HEY.

43:29.840 --> 43:32.308
UH...STEPHEN?

43:32.340 --> 43:34.672
STEPHEN.

43:34.980 --> 43:37.938
IT'S YOUR DAD.

43:38.440 --> 43:40.806
I WAS JUST THINKING, UH...

43:40.850 --> 43:44.843
THAT WE COULD
GET TOGETHER SOMETIME.

43:47.920 --> 43:53.085
* I WOULD WRAP YOU IN ANGELS

43:53.130 --> 43:57.419
