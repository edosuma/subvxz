01:01.269 --> 01:04.731
I'm Special Agent Willy Gibbs
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

01:05.398 --> 01:07.317
Where's Sissy? I need to talk to her.

01:10.862 --> 01:12.781
[recorder whirring softly]

01:12.864 --> 01:16.826
Mrs. Cooper and the boy have been released
back into the custody of Mr. Cooper.

01:20.663 --> 01:22.123
What's your last name, Vanya?

01:24.542 --> 01:25.418
Hargreeves.

01:25.502 --> 01:27.712
Do you have any ID
that could attest to that?

01:28.922 --> 01:30.882
No driver's license, birth certificate?

01:31.925 --> 01:33.468
-You from around here?
-No.

01:34.511 --> 01:36.429
I'm... I, uh... I'm... I'm not sure.

01:37.138 --> 01:38.014
You're not sure.

01:39.432 --> 01:41.684
Well, I told the other officer
I was hit by a car.

01:41.768 --> 01:43.603
-I have amnesia.
-Right.

01:43.686 --> 01:47.315
Yes, amnesia. They told me about that.
So how does that work, exactly?

01:47.398 --> 01:49.484
I can't remember anything
from before a month ago.

01:50.110 --> 01:51.528
Except your name, of course.

01:52.987 --> 01:54.239
Yeah, except my name.

01:54.447 --> 01:56.533
[Gibbs]
Far as I can tell, it's like you simply...

01:57.575 --> 01:59.160
materialized out of thin air.

01:59.953 --> 02:00.995
Welcome to my world.

02:03.331 --> 02:04.290
"Vanya."

02:07.335 --> 02:08.920
That's a Russian name, isn't it?

02:09.379 --> 02:10.296
I'm not Russian.

02:10.380 --> 02:12.132
If you have amnesia,
how can you say for sure?

02:12.215 --> 02:14.759
In fact, I'm curious as to how you know
your first and last name

02:14.843 --> 02:16.928
-but you don't remember anything else.
-I don't know.

02:17.011 --> 02:19.806
-How did you send those troopers flying?
-I'm sorry, I don't know.

02:19.889 --> 02:21.975
[in Russian]
What are you doing here in Dallas?

02:22.058 --> 02:23.143
[in Russian] I don't know!

02:29.941 --> 02:30.900
[Gibbs] Hmm.

02:31.693 --> 02:33.236
[in English] You speak Russian.

02:34.279 --> 02:36.072
-I... I don't... I...
-[Gibbs] Wonderful.

02:37.031 --> 02:39.742
-I must've just learned a little as a kid.
-[Gibbs] A little?

02:39.826 --> 02:41.703
I think you speak it very well.

02:41.786 --> 02:44.289
What I want to know is,
how does a young woman

02:44.372 --> 02:45.832
who says she isn't Russian,

02:45.915 --> 02:47.375
but speaks Russian,

02:47.458 --> 02:50.003
end up working as a nanny
to some simple-headed boy

02:50.086 --> 02:51.713
in the middle of nowhere, Texas?

02:52.505 --> 02:55.466
I need to make a phone call.
I have the right to make a call, don't I?

02:55.550 --> 02:57.927
If there is one thing the FBI
takes seriously,

02:58.011 --> 03:00.054
it is a Communist threat to this country.

03:00.346 --> 03:01.973
Now, I want answers,

03:02.223 --> 03:03.641
real answers,

03:03.975 --> 03:06.186
and I will do whatever it takes
to get them.

03:06.269 --> 03:09.480
You're not going anywhere
until I find out who you really are.

03:38.551 --> 03:40.887
[Gibbs groans, clears throat]

03:50.605 --> 03:51.522
[Luther] Now what?

03:51.606 --> 03:53.233
[Five] Now nothing, Luther, all right?

03:53.316 --> 03:54.943
-Make your peace with God.
-[Luther] What?

03:55.026 --> 03:56.444
What about Allison and Vanya?

03:56.527 --> 03:58.655
[Five] Screw them both.
They should have been here.

03:58.738 --> 04:00.657
[Klaus groans] What about Diego?

04:00.740 --> 04:03.993
-He's quite a responsible young man, no?
-[Five grunts, sighs]

04:04.077 --> 04:06.579
-Something must've happened to them.
-Screw Diego, all right?

04:06.663 --> 04:07.997
Screw everybody!

04:08.081 --> 04:10.166
I was better off on my own
in the apocalypse.

04:10.250 --> 04:12.168
Five! Come on.

04:12.252 --> 04:15.255
You know what, Luther?
It's every sibling for himself now.

04:15.755 --> 04:16.839
How 'bout that?

04:18.132 --> 04:19.926
-[door opens, slams shut]
-[Klaus sighs]

04:20.009 --> 04:23.137
[whimpering] Did Five just get meaner?

04:23.221 --> 04:25.390
Klaus, go check on Allison, okay?

04:25.473 --> 04:26.599
Make sure she's okay.

04:27.058 --> 04:30.061
Find the others and we'll meet back here.
I'll handle Five.

04:31.020 --> 04:32.855
[Klaus grunts, sighs]

04:32.939 --> 04:34.190
And you,

04:34.941 --> 04:39.737
you have had
your possession privileges revoked.

04:40.697 --> 04:42.699
-I regret nothing.
-[Klaus sighs]

04:43.324 --> 04:45.952
-Just stay out of me.
-I regret nothing!

04:46.035 --> 04:46.953
[Klaus] Back off!

04:47.495 --> 04:50.415
Hey! Five, doomsday is still coming.

04:50.498 --> 04:53.084
-We gotta think of a new plan.
-Don't you get it, Luther?

04:53.167 --> 04:56.671
-It's over, all right? We're already dead.
-Then where are you going?

04:56.754 --> 04:58.673
I'm going to do the unthinkable.

04:58.756 --> 05:00.425
-The hell is that supposed to mean?
-[sighs]

05:00.508 --> 05:02.510
I was really hoping
it wouldn't come to this.

05:02.593 --> 05:03.845
Come to what, Five?

05:05.138 --> 05:06.014
Five.

05:06.931 --> 05:08.474
-[door locks]
-Five!

05:09.142 --> 05:10.059
Come to what?

05:11.936 --> 05:12.854
Five!

05:14.856 --> 05:17.442
[Ray] Oh, sweet Jesus,
what the hell are we gonna do?

05:17.525 --> 05:19.736
-It's okay, it's okay. Calm down, Ray.
-Calm down?

05:19.819 --> 05:22.697
Allison, you killed a vacuum cleaner
salesman in our goddamn living room.

05:22.780 --> 05:24.699
[Allison]
Okay, technically, his brother killed him.

05:24.782 --> 05:27.702
And they were not here to sell vacuums.

05:27.785 --> 05:30.621
There is a giant dead white boy
on our couch.

05:30.705 --> 05:32.665
Yeah, you know, I'll admit,
that doesn't look good.

05:32.749 --> 05:33.750
Oh, we're done.

05:34.167 --> 05:37.086
The movement is finished, Allison.
They're gonna give me the chair for this.

05:37.170 --> 05:39.213
-They're not gonna give you the--
-[knocking at door]

05:41.299 --> 05:43.426
[voice trembles] Okay. Okay.

05:49.057 --> 05:50.141
[door unlocks]

05:50.350 --> 05:53.186
Hey, Ray-Ray.
I'm so sorry it's late, but, uh--

05:53.269 --> 05:54.854
Klaus, now is not a good time.

05:54.937 --> 05:56.064
[Klaus] Oh, I'm sorry.

05:56.606 --> 05:57.899
Allison! Hey!

05:57.982 --> 06:00.735
I was so worried about you.
Thank God you're okay.

06:00.818 --> 06:02.403
What's, uh... What's the matter?

06:02.487 --> 06:05.114
You guys have been wrastling in here
or something?

06:07.200 --> 06:08.701
-[Allison sighs]
-[Klaus] Oh.

06:09.369 --> 06:10.828
Oh, I see.

06:12.705 --> 06:15.249
It's gonna be one of those kinda nights,
huh?

06:16.334 --> 06:17.710
So, are we burnin' or buryin'?

06:19.837 --> 06:21.589
[cats meowing]

06:23.674 --> 06:25.134
[Allison, echoing] I heard a rumor...

06:25.218 --> 06:26.552
you killed your brother.

-[shouts]
-[cat yowls]

07:35.872 --> 07:38.583
-Are you kidding me?
-You said I could hire my own team.

07:38.666 --> 07:41.169
Yes, but I didn't mean him,
for God's sake.

07:41.252 --> 07:43.713
If you don't see the problem
with hiring you-know-who's brother,

07:43.796 --> 07:45.298
then you're not ready for that badge.

07:45.381 --> 07:47.175
I'm sorry, but I really need to get going.

07:47.258 --> 07:48.217
[both] Shut up!

07:48.301 --> 07:50.470
I can't do this job
if you don't trust my instincts.

07:50.553 --> 07:53.806
Sweetheart, your vagina needs glasses.
He is not worth it.

07:53.890 --> 07:54.932
Mum! Oh, my God.

07:55.391 --> 07:58.644
This may shock you,
but not everyone here likes you.

07:58.728 --> 08:00.730
Sounds ridiculous, but go on.

08:00.813 --> 08:03.649
You need fresh blood loyal to us
and not the old regime.

08:03.733 --> 08:05.359
I've seen Diego in the field.

08:05.443 --> 08:08.362
He is so much better trained
than most of the assholes here.

08:08.446 --> 08:10.531
Why waste that when we can use it?

08:11.157 --> 08:13.451
He'll be my personal responsibility.

08:19.290 --> 08:22.251
You know, your brother Five and I...

08:23.586 --> 08:25.213
we have quite...

08:25.922 --> 08:27.465
a colorful history.

08:29.509 --> 08:32.136
-[lighter flicks, lights]
-My brother has beef with everybody,

08:32.220 --> 08:33.054
me included.

08:33.137 --> 08:34.680
[Handler] Let me ask you something.

08:34.764 --> 08:36.891
When you're looking down
the barrel of a gun,

08:37.683 --> 08:41.229
where do your loyalties lie,
with your family or your principles?

08:41.604 --> 08:42.522
With me.

08:44.232 --> 08:45.775
I don't belong to anybody.

08:46.859 --> 08:47.985
Especially Lila.

08:49.195 --> 08:50.571
[Handler] That I can work with.

08:51.322 --> 08:54.283
Run him through orientation,
fill out his start paperwork.

08:55.076 --> 08:55.952
But...

08:56.577 --> 08:58.746
if he ruffles even one feather,

08:59.413 --> 09:01.791
you will kill him yourself.

09:01.874 --> 09:03.543
-Understood?
-Thanks, Mum.

09:08.673 --> 09:11.217

[Grace gasps softly]

10:05.646 --> 10:06.939
[exhales sharply]

10:09.984 --> 10:11.068
Oh, my God.

10:13.070 --> 10:14.655
[Reginald]
What are you doing in here?

10:17.950 --> 10:19.285
[Grace chuckles nervously]

10:19.493 --> 10:21.454
Not sure what I could say that would...

10:22.622 --> 10:23.956
overwrite the obvious.

10:24.999 --> 10:25.958
Fair enough.

10:26.751 --> 10:28.085
New question, then.

10:29.378 --> 10:30.504
Why are you doing it?

10:32.798 --> 10:36.260
Are you involved in somethin' nefarious?

10:36.344 --> 10:40.264
Quite often. Did you have something
more specific in mind?

10:42.725 --> 10:45.936
That... That shaggy man at the consulate,

10:46.020 --> 10:48.272
the one who chased after us
with the little boy.

10:48.356 --> 10:51.150
-Calls himself Diego.
-Yes, that's the one.

10:51.233 --> 10:52.068
He...

10:54.195 --> 10:56.906
He thinks that you want to harm
the president.

10:57.448 --> 10:58.407
I see.

10:59.492 --> 11:01.744
You take the word of lunatics these days?

11:02.662 --> 11:04.705
Not over yours, but these...

11:05.289 --> 11:06.540
these photographs,

11:07.166 --> 11:10.127
they're all about the president's visit
tomorrow, aren't they?

11:11.796 --> 11:15.383
You know there are aspects of my work
I cannot discuss.

11:16.509 --> 11:18.969
You've always respected that line.

11:19.470 --> 11:21.972
I don't need to know the details, Reggie.

11:22.473 --> 11:25.101
I just need to know
that you're not involved

11:25.184 --> 11:27.061
in what I'm afraid you might be.

11:29.563 --> 11:31.691
What are you really afraid of, my dear?

11:34.485 --> 11:37.446
There's so much about you
I don't understand.

11:37.863 --> 11:39.699
I could say the same about you.

11:45.246 --> 11:48.290
I want to share my life with you, Reggie,

11:49.875 --> 11:52.586
but I need to know you're a good man.

11:53.629 --> 11:56.632
I need to know
you would never hurt the president.

11:57.800 --> 12:01.429
As I said, there are elements in my life

12:01.971 --> 12:03.514
that I can't discuss with you.

12:04.682 --> 12:05.641
Someday...

12:06.600 --> 12:08.477
I hope to share it all with you.

12:10.271 --> 12:11.397
Until then...

12:12.898 --> 12:14.442
I'm asking you to trust me.

12:20.781 --> 12:22.700
[sobs softly] I can't wait that long.

12:24.535 --> 12:25.494
I'm sorry.

[splutters, groans]

12:46.474 --> 12:47.475
[Luther mutters] Shit.

12:48.225 --> 12:49.059
Five?

12:50.102 --> 12:51.020
Five, what...

12:52.354 --> 12:53.189
You okay?

12:54.482 --> 12:55.483
[Five slurping]

12:56.025 --> 12:57.485
[gasping heavily]

12:57.985 --> 13:01.030
-I'm gonna need to be hydrated. [sighs]
-Hydrated?

13:05.159 --> 13:07.036
What's with the baby powder?

13:07.578 --> 13:08.913
It'll help with the itching.

13:08.996 --> 13:12.041
What itching? There's itching?
What the hell is going on here?

13:13.918 --> 13:15.336
You do have a plan.

13:15.920 --> 13:17.046
[Five exhales sharply]

13:17.797 --> 13:20.466
Well, it's a desperation move, but...

13:20.800 --> 13:22.384
since our brain-dead siblings

13:22.468 --> 13:25.012
are incapable of meeting
a simple deadline,

13:25.888 --> 13:27.014
I got no choice.

13:27.973 --> 13:30.601
-No choice about what?
-I have to find myself.

13:31.519 --> 13:32.812
[flicks watch open, shut]

13:32.895 --> 13:35.022
I just arrived in Dallas 15 minutes ago.

13:35.898 --> 13:38.567
-Should I be worried about you?
-Luther, if you recall,

13:39.109 --> 13:42.279
I was sent to 1963

13:42.863 --> 13:44.198
on a job by the Commission

13:44.281 --> 13:46.200
to make sure the president
was assassinated.

13:46.283 --> 13:48.661
Oh! So, wait,
you're old self is out there.

13:48.744 --> 13:50.412
Precisely. [exhales]

13:50.496 --> 13:52.081
What, just walking around Dallas?

13:52.164 --> 13:56.293
Walking around Dallas with a briefcase
that can get us home.

13:56.752 --> 13:59.255
Oh, my God. Five, you're a genius.

13:59.338 --> 14:01.799
However,
there are two significant problems

14:01.882 --> 14:02.925
with this plan.

14:03.259 --> 14:05.886
Problem number one:
I am a trained assassin,

14:05.970 --> 14:09.890
arguably the most dangerous assassin
in the space-time continuum.

14:10.307 --> 14:13.477
If I know me, I'm not going
to react kindly to bumping into myself.

14:13.561 --> 14:14.937
Problem number two,

14:15.020 --> 14:17.064
and this is the real fly
in the ointment here:

14:17.940 --> 14:20.317
you're not supposed to exist
in close proximity to yourself

14:20.401 --> 14:21.569
in the same timeline.

14:22.444 --> 14:24.405
The side effects can be disastrous.

14:24.488 --> 14:26.615
Side effects? What sort of side effects?

14:26.699 --> 14:31.203
Well, according to Commission Handbook
Chapter 27, subsection 3b,

14:31.287 --> 14:33.747
the seven stages
in paradox psychosis are...

14:33.831 --> 14:35.916
stage one: denial,

14:36.000 --> 14:37.293
two: itching,

14:37.376 --> 14:39.128
three: extreme thirst and urination,

14:39.211 --> 14:40.713
four: excessive gas,

14:40.796 --> 14:42.381
five: acute paranoia,

14:42.464 --> 14:44.383
six: uncontrolled perspiration,

14:44.884 --> 14:45.718
and seven:

14:46.760 --> 14:47.928
homicidal rage.

14:49.638 --> 14:51.181
-Homicidal rage?
-[Five] Yeah.

14:51.265 --> 14:53.934
[Luther] Jeez, I don't know.
This maybe isn't such a good idea.

14:54.018 --> 14:55.311
[Five] It's a Hail Mary.

14:55.644 --> 14:57.479
But what choice do we got, Luther?

14:57.563 --> 14:59.982
I don't know, you already seem
a bit squirrelly if I'm being honest.

15:00.065 --> 15:00.900
[Five] Look, Luther,

15:00.983 --> 15:03.569
I'm gonna need you to help me
get through this one, all right? I...

15:03.777 --> 15:04.820
I need a spotter.

15:04.904 --> 15:06.363
-A spotter?
-Yeah.

15:06.989 --> 15:08.324
What is that? Like, a wingman?

15:08.741 --> 15:11.327
In case the paradox psychosis
gets too severe,

15:11.410 --> 15:13.162
I need you to help me stay on task,
all right?

15:13.245 --> 15:16.498
So, whatever happens, whatever I say,

15:17.166 --> 15:18.751
we need to get that briefcase.

15:19.919 --> 15:21.545
-Okay?
-Okay.

15:21.879 --> 15:22.755
Okay.

15:28.260 --> 15:29.970
-Luther, come on.
-Right.

15:31.805 --> 15:33.432
[Carl] So, they're questioning her now?

15:34.475 --> 15:36.852

she's not who she was pretending to be.

It's not your fault.

for a place to hide out.

-We need to work through this, damn it.

keeping the correct timeline

24:55.118 --> 24:56.620
-at all times.
-[soft snoring]

24:56.703 --> 25:00.290
Whatever your skill, education,
or comfort level with moral ambiguity,

25:00.373 --> 25:03.376
the Commission has an exciting career path
in store for you.

25:03.793 --> 25:05.504
Let's start with the tube room...

25:05.587 --> 25:08.507
-[lively Irish jig playing]
-[indistinct chatter]

25:14.179 --> 25:15.180
[Luther sighs]

25:15.263 --> 25:16.139
Well...

25:17.140 --> 25:18.600
this is nice, isn't it?

25:18.683 --> 25:21.019
The three of us, together like this.

25:21.520 --> 25:22.604
[both Fives] No.

25:23.271 --> 25:26.858
Somebody explain to me how it is
I'm having a pint of Guinness

25:26.942 --> 25:29.361
-with my younger self.
-Older, actually.

25:29.736 --> 25:32.280
I'm you, just 14 days older.

25:32.364 --> 25:34.115
I have pubic hair smarter than you.

25:34.199 --> 25:36.117
-How's that possible?
-[teen Five] I can explain.

25:36.201 --> 25:38.995
You see, one hour from now,
on the grassy knoll,

25:39.079 --> 25:40.747
before the president is killed,

25:41.206 --> 25:43.375
you break your contract
with the Commission.

25:43.458 --> 25:45.460
I already know you're thinking about it.

25:45.544 --> 25:47.003
All those years in the apocalypse,

25:47.087 --> 25:49.422
we never stopped worrying
about our family.

25:49.965 --> 25:52.676
Well, today,
you are going to do something about it.

25:52.759 --> 25:56.680
Today, you are going to attempt
to time travel forward to 2019.

25:56.763 --> 25:59.224
However, you are going
to screw up the jump

25:59.307 --> 26:01.268
and end up in this twip of a body,

26:01.601 --> 26:04.563
trapped forever, small, pubescent.

26:04.646 --> 26:06.064
Okay. [farts]

26:07.399 --> 26:09.693
Even if I was to believe you,
what am I supposed to do about it,

26:09.776 --> 26:11.861
-not jump?
-[teen Five] No, no. I need you to jump.

26:11.945 --> 26:14.155
If you don't jump, I cease to exist.

26:14.239 --> 26:16.700
What I need from you is to jump correctly.

26:16.783 --> 26:18.577
-I'm listening.
-The first time through,

26:18.660 --> 26:20.412
I got the calculation wrong.

26:20.495 --> 26:22.372
That's how I ended up in this body.

26:22.455 --> 26:25.208
But now, I know the correct calculation.

26:26.501 --> 26:27.377
What is it?

26:27.460 --> 26:28.920
I'll be glad to tell you...

26:29.254 --> 26:32.382
in exchange for that briefcase
you're holding under the table.

26:33.967 --> 26:36.595
[Luther] Yeah, yeah,
so you go back to 2019,

26:36.678 --> 26:38.888
as planned,
but this time with the right math,

26:39.306 --> 26:41.057
so you remain a full-grown man.

26:41.141 --> 26:44.436
In exchange, we get that briefcase
that you no longer need.

26:45.145 --> 26:47.939
Timeline restored, paradox resolved.

26:48.440 --> 26:50.942
Everyone goes on existing
happily ever after.

26:52.944 --> 26:54.487
That's quite a bit to take in.

26:56.281 --> 26:57.282
What do you think?

27:04.164 --> 27:05.123
[adult Five] I think...

27:05.957 --> 27:07.292
I need to piss.

27:14.799 --> 27:15.759
[Luther] Oh.

27:18.011 --> 27:20.847
Well, besides the flop sweat,

27:21.556 --> 27:23.266
I think that went pretty well, am I right?

27:23.350 --> 27:24.768
No, no, there's something...

27:25.185 --> 27:28.521
-Something doesn't feel right about this.
-What... What do you mean?

27:29.022 --> 27:30.231
I don't trust him.

27:31.816 --> 27:32.984
But he's you.

27:34.527 --> 27:35.362
Exactly.

27:36.738 --> 27:39.407
-[typewriters clacking nearby]
-[office phone ringing]

27:41.284 --> 27:43.703
[gentle chime over speakers]

27:43.787 --> 27:46.706
[woman over PA]
A tidy workspace is a happy workspace.

28:02.931 --> 28:05.684
[Diego] Bingo, the Infinite Switchboard.

28:11.523 --> 28:13.400
All right. [pops knuckles]

28:13.692 --> 28:15.068
How hard can this be?

28:24.911 --> 28:27.455
[switchboard whirring]

28:28.081 --> 28:30.625
-[console beeping]
-[shouts, groaning]

28:36.131 --> 28:38.508
Oh! Please don't hurt me. [panting]

28:38.591 --> 28:39.676
Who the hell are you?

28:40.260 --> 28:42.262
I'm Herb. I'm an analyst.

28:42.345 --> 28:44.639
I'm Diego. I have a knife.

28:44.723 --> 28:46.349
[breath trembling] Yes, I can see.

28:46.433 --> 28:48.560
[gulps loudly] It's very shiny.

28:51.229 --> 28:52.355
Oh. [inhales sharply]

28:52.814 --> 28:53.815
Breathe.

28:54.983 --> 28:56.443
[panting softly]

28:56.526 --> 28:58.361
It's an honor to meet you,
Mr. Hargreeves.

28:58.778 --> 28:59.612
You know me?

29:00.238 --> 29:01.489
Everybody knows you.

29:01.573 --> 29:02.991
I mean, you're Number Two.

29:03.074 --> 29:04.159
You're a legend.

29:05.910 --> 29:08.997
-Really?
-Mr. Hargreeves, you can't be here.

29:09.080 --> 29:11.499
Herb, is that any way to talk to a legend?

29:13.543 --> 29:15.044
You know how to work this puppy?

29:16.254 --> 29:19.007
-I'm certified to operate the ISB, yes.
-Good.

29:19.090 --> 29:21.885
I need you to look up a date:
November 22, 1963,

29:21.968 --> 29:23.720
the assassination of John F. Kennedy.

29:23.803 --> 29:25.472
Unauthorized use
of the Infinite Switchboard

29:25.555 --> 29:27.348
is a clear violation
of company protocol 67D--

29:27.432 --> 29:29.017
Don't be such a tight-ass.

29:30.185 --> 29:31.561
You don't understand.

29:32.395 --> 29:34.230
-There's been a coup d'état.
-What's that?

29:34.981 --> 29:36.608
-Cadillac?
-No.

29:37.358 --> 29:38.485
[huffs softly]

29:38.610 --> 29:40.612
The Handler has taken over the Commission.

29:41.362 --> 29:43.323
The whole place has gone to heck
in a handbasket,

29:43.406 --> 29:44.657
and people are disappearing.

29:45.575 --> 29:47.368
They would kill us both
if they caught us in here.

29:47.452 --> 29:49.537
Well, you better get started
before they come get us.

29:53.166 --> 29:55.168
One quick look, and then you gotta go.

29:55.251 --> 29:56.252
My man.

29:57.796 --> 29:58.797
[Herb] Okay...

29:58.963 --> 30:02.425
-Oh, no. Why would you... No, no. Bad.
-[switchboard powers down]

30:02.509 --> 30:03.843
Don't hurt the timeline.

30:03.927 --> 30:05.386
That's a rule...

30:05.804 --> 30:08.306
-that I intend to follow.
-[switchboard powering up]

30:08.389 --> 30:10.391
[machines whirring]

30:13.144 --> 30:15.230
This one connects to that one...

30:15.730 --> 30:18.024
[Herb muttering indistinctly]

30:23.530 --> 30:24.489
Okay.

30:26.074 --> 30:27.200
Here we go.

30:27.659 --> 30:31.287
Dallas. November 22, 1963.

30:33.873 --> 30:34.707
[Diego] This is it.

30:34.791 --> 30:37.418
-This is right before the assassination.
-[Herb] Assassination?

30:37.502 --> 30:40.964
[Diego] Pay attention. The president
is about to turn into Dealey Plaza.

30:43.091 --> 30:46.052
One more turn into Elm
and they're gonna start shooting.

30:46.553 --> 30:49.472
-Whoa, whoa, whoa. What the hell is that?
-[Herb] That's the FBI building.

30:49.556 --> 30:51.516
[Diego] Yeah, but why the hell
did it just blow up?

30:51.599 --> 30:54.018
-[Herb] That's not supposed to happen?
-[Diego] No, that's not sup--

30:54.102 --> 30:56.020
He's driving away. They didn't kill him?

30:56.104 --> 30:59.607
-Holy shit.
-Oh... Oy, that's no bueno.

31:00.650 --> 31:03.152
It wasn't a gunshot, it was an explosion

31:03.236 --> 31:06.364
-we heard on the Frankel footage.
-[reporter] ...the attack on Dealey Plaza,

31:06.447 --> 31:08.324
as the Soviets deny all responsibility.

31:08.408 --> 31:10.159
[reporter 2]
Moscow promises a fierce response

31:10.243 --> 31:12.078
in retaliation to American attacks.

31:12.161 --> 31:15.081
[reporter 3] Anchorage, Alaska, has just
been decimated by the Red Menace!

31:15.164 --> 31:17.083
[reporter 4]
The world braces as we find ourselves

31:17.166 --> 31:19.043
-on the brink of nuclear war.
-[alarm wails]

31:19.127 --> 31:22.171
-All citizens take cov--
-[flat tone over broadcast]

31:22.255 --> 31:24.966
-That's what Hazel was trying to tell us.
-Hazel?

31:25.884 --> 31:27.343
I mean, this is what causes doomsday.

31:27.427 --> 31:29.262
Do you have another angle
on the FBI building?

31:29.345 --> 31:30.305
[Herb] Watch this.

31:32.265 --> 31:33.182
And...

31:33.266 --> 31:34.851
-[people screaming]
-[wreckage crashing]

31:34.934 --> 31:36.311
[sirens wailing below]

31:36.394 --> 31:39.898
[high-pitched tone resonating, warbling]

31:41.149 --> 31:42.108
Vanya.

31:48.573 --> 31:49.782
Vanya is the bomb.

31:49.866 --> 31:51.200
Vanya is the bomb.

31:53.369 --> 31:54.913
She will always be the bomb.

31:58.041 --> 31:59.542
I need to get back to Dallas.

32:00.126 --> 32:01.002
Now.

32:03.296 --> 32:05.715
We need La Résistance.

32:05.798 --> 32:07.800
[overlapping low chatter]

32:10.595 --> 32:11.930
[group grows quiet]

32:15.558 --> 32:16.809
You gotta be kidding me.

32:17.185 --> 32:20.021
I know we don't look like much,
but we're resourceful.

32:20.104 --> 32:21.773
Don't mess with case management.

32:21.856 --> 32:23.066
Stand down, Dot.

32:30.823 --> 32:33.159
-[faucet running]
-[Irish music plays, muted]

32:33.743 --> 32:34.827
[turns water off]

32:36.245 --> 32:37.288
[sighs softly]

32:44.921 --> 32:46.381
[toilet flushes]

32:48.341 --> 32:49.592
Oh. Sorry.

32:51.511 --> 32:52.512
Ugh.

32:53.805 --> 32:56.849
[chuckles] Yeah, that's a waste of time.

32:56.933 --> 32:57.934
Trust me.

32:58.393 --> 33:01.020
Then why were you holding it when
I found you dead in the apocalypse?

33:01.104 --> 33:02.522
[Luther splutters] No idea.

33:02.605 --> 33:05.566
But the guy it belonged to
didn't end the world. Vanya did.

33:05.984 --> 33:07.652
-Timid little Vanya.
-[Luther] Yep.

33:07.735 --> 33:10.154
Is more powerful
than all of us put together.

33:10.238 --> 33:12.740
Turns out, she was pissed about the way
we treated her when we were kids,

33:13.157 --> 33:16.244
so she destroyed the moon
and ended the world.

33:16.703 --> 33:18.871
Huh. Fair enough.

33:20.123 --> 33:21.833
[Luther zips pants, sighs]

33:21.916 --> 33:23.126
-Yeah--
-This is perfect.

33:23.668 --> 33:25.753
We now know exactly what's gonna happen.

33:26.629 --> 33:28.881
Yeah, except it, uh, already did.

33:28.965 --> 33:30.675
Don't think, just listen.

33:30.758 --> 33:33.720
Forget about the little jerk-off's plan.
It's way too complicated.

33:33.803 --> 33:37.557
A much better plan
is for us to travel to 2019.

33:37.640 --> 33:39.809
All we have to do is make nice with Vanya,

33:39.892 --> 33:42.520
stop her from destroying the world.
Easy-peasy.

33:43.271 --> 33:44.397
Hmm.

33:45.523 --> 33:46.566
Well, that's actually--

33:46.649 --> 33:48.484
-That's not bad, right?
-Yeah, yeah.

33:48.568 --> 33:49.777
But what about Five?

33:50.194 --> 33:51.904
I mean, you? I mean,

33:51.988 --> 33:54.323
-the, uh, young you.
-That's not me.

33:54.407 --> 33:57.660
That's a prepubescent photocopy
that got botched in the time jump.

33:57.744 --> 34:00.038
-Besides, it's too late for him anyway.
-Too late?

34:01.372 --> 34:02.790
Paradox psychosis?

34:02.874 --> 34:04.792
Best thing we can do
is put him out of his misery.

34:05.710 --> 34:06.544
What?

34:06.627 --> 34:10.089
-You're... You're saying to kill him?
-You're thinking about this all wrong.

34:10.173 --> 34:11.632
-We're not killing anybody.
-No--

34:11.716 --> 34:14.719
Look at me.
I'm Five, and I will still be alive.

34:14.802 --> 34:17.346
All we are doing is getting rid of
a mutant doppelganger.

34:18.556 --> 34:20.099
Amputating a vestigial nipple.

34:22.894 --> 34:23.728
Wait...

34:24.437 --> 34:26.856
are you sure you don't have
paradox psychosis?

34:27.273 --> 34:28.941
I've never felt better in my life.

34:30.276 --> 34:31.277
[door opens]

34:31.903 --> 34:34.113
-[lively Irish jig playing]
-[patrons chattering]

34:35.948 --> 34:36.783
We good?

34:37.867 --> 34:39.702
-We're good.
-You got a deal.

34:40.453 --> 34:42.288
We gotta hurry. Kennedy's en route.

34:43.081 --> 34:44.749
Less than an hour until showtime.

34:45.792 --> 34:48.086
Why are you so anxious to get going
all of a sudden?

34:48.169 --> 34:49.128
Relax.

34:50.171 --> 34:51.881
-You're getting paranoid.
-[scoffing chuckle]

34:51.964 --> 34:53.091
Oh, am I?

34:53.174 --> 34:55.093
[both Fives farting]

34:55.176 --> 34:56.344
Okay, let's roll.

35:03.810 --> 35:06.145
[dramatic instrumental music playing]

35:08.147 --> 35:10.274
[female interrogator]
She'll start talking soon enough.

35:10.858 --> 35:14.612
Vanya, talking to us
is your only option.

35:15.988 --> 35:19.117
Who is your handler? Answer me.

35:19.200 --> 35:20.493
-[Gibbs echoes]
-[gasps softly]

35:20.576 --> 35:22.286
-Excuse me?
-We're all waiting.

35:22.370 --> 35:23.830
-[Vanya] For what?
-The answer.

35:25.039 --> 35:26.707
I... I don't... I don't understand.

35:29.669 --> 35:31.712
So you're not prepared,
is that what you're saying?

35:31.796 --> 35:33.798
-Well, prepared for what?
-[Ben] It's not her fault.

35:33.881 --> 35:35.967
She hit her head.
She can't remember anything.

35:36.050 --> 35:38.469
She got overheated,
wiped her mind clean.

35:38.803 --> 35:40.930
She's lazy. Didn't study.

35:41.013 --> 35:44.350
-No, no, that's not it. I--
-Maybe she's been faking it all along.

35:44.433 --> 35:47.145
-She's just not ready for this.
-[Reginald] You're all wrong.

35:47.812 --> 35:50.815
Number Seven deliberately chooses
not to remember.

35:59.532 --> 36:00.366
[Vanya] Mom?

36:01.617 --> 36:02.743
Are you okay?

36:03.161 --> 36:04.370
Of course I am.

36:04.704 --> 36:06.038
Why wouldn't I be?

36:28.352 --> 36:29.353
Something wrong?

36:31.689 --> 36:33.733
-Just not hungry.
-[Reginald] Try it.

36:34.192 --> 36:37.069
-It might help you remember.
-[Gibbs echoes] ...remember.

36:40.031 --> 36:42.158
[Gibbs]
Vanya, what are you doing in Dallas?

36:43.826 --> 36:45.745
Keep ignoring me
and see what happens.

36:46.370 --> 36:48.289
[female interrogator]
We will get you to talk.

36:48.372 --> 36:52.251
-[cutlery clinks softly on plates]
-[suspenseful instrumental music playing]

36:55.630 --> 36:59.008
[squishy chewing]

37:18.569 --> 37:20.947
[suspenseful instrumental music swells]

37:29.330 --> 37:31.999
-[groans]
-[Harlan moaning]

37:32.083 --> 37:34.001
[Vanya grunting and choking]

37:34.085 --> 37:36.545
-Number Seven! Either you remember...
-[siblings laughing]

37:37.630 --> 37:40.049
...or you will go to your room
without dessert!

37:40.132 --> 37:41.092
[cutlery rattling]

37:41.175 --> 37:43.052
[Gibbs] What the hell's going on
with the lights?

37:43.135 --> 37:44.971
[female interrogator]
She's not responding.

37:45.054 --> 37:46.347
Let's help motivate her.

37:47.890 --> 37:49.267
[electricity surges]

37:49.350 --> 37:52.728
[gasps, moans loudly]

37:53.771 --> 37:55.523
[Harlan groaning]

37:55.606 --> 37:57.733
[shuddering grunts]

37:57.817 --> 37:59.527
[Gibbs]
Are you here to kill the president?

38:00.236 --> 38:03.239
[crying out, groaning]

38:03.322 --> 38:05.324
[Allison panting]

38:06.784 --> 38:10.079
God, why are people so much heavier
when they're dead?

38:10.162 --> 38:11.622
You got a lot of practice at this?

38:14.583 --> 38:15.751
[Klaus chuckles] Yeah.

38:15.960 --> 38:19.338
Hey, so, what was it like
when I possessed you?

38:20.172 --> 38:23.968
It was like sex
with one of the lesser Baldwins.

38:24.051 --> 38:27.346
I mean, you can feel him
clattering around in there,

38:27.430 --> 38:28.472
but do you really care?

38:29.140 --> 38:32.184
Why? What was it like
driving all this hot business?

38:32.685 --> 38:35.730
It... It was like having no skin...

38:36.272 --> 38:40.276
but still wanting to touch... everything.

38:40.359 --> 38:41.360
[whispers] Oh, yeah.

38:42.153 --> 38:44.864
Okay. One... two...

38:44.947 --> 38:46.949
[straining, grunts]

38:47.658 --> 38:49.243
-[zapping whoosh]
-[Ray shrieks]

38:49.327 --> 38:51.787
-Shit!
-[all gasping, panting]

38:51.871 --> 38:53.247
-[Allison] Oh!
-[Diego] Oh, good.

38:53.331 --> 38:55.374
All right, you're both here.
All right, we gotta go.

38:55.750 --> 38:57.543
Diego, Jesus!

38:57.626 --> 39:01.380
[chuckling] Wow.
Number Two, Three, and Four.

39:01.464 --> 39:04.050
We almost have an Umbrella
straight flush here.

39:04.133 --> 39:07.803
Ray, this is my other brother, Diego.

39:09.221 --> 39:11.974
[Diego] Hey, man.
Sorry to crash in here like this.

39:13.768 --> 39:15.227
Hey, who is this guy?

39:15.311 --> 39:17.605
Herb. He worked with Five
at the Commission.

39:17.688 --> 39:18.564
The Commission?

39:18.981 --> 39:21.734
We monitor and maintain
the time-space continuum.

39:22.193 --> 39:24.362
-Okay.
-[Diego] No, for real. I was just there.

39:24.445 --> 39:26.447
It's awesome.
Okay, I got to look at the timeline.

39:26.530 --> 39:27.990
I know what causes doomsday.

39:29.367 --> 39:30.326
It's Vanya.

39:30.743 --> 39:31.619
Wait, what?

39:31.702 --> 39:32.620
How?

39:32.703 --> 39:34.538
Gonna blow up the federal building
at Dealey Plaza

39:34.622 --> 39:37.249
just as the president's passing through
in less than one hour.

39:37.666 --> 39:40.044
We gotta find her and stop her, now.

39:40.127 --> 39:42.421
-Wait, Vanya kills the president?
-[Diego] No, no, no.

39:42.505 --> 39:45.800
See, the explosion causes the motorcade
to drive off. Kennedy lives.

39:46.175 --> 39:48.552
Everybody thinks Russia's behind it,
including the president.

39:48.636 --> 39:50.554
He strikes back, they strike back.

39:50.638 --> 39:52.515
Before you know it,
it's raining nukes.

39:52.598 --> 39:54.266
-Okay, um...
-Holy shit.

39:54.350 --> 39:55.810
-[Allison] Ray? Ray, baby.
-[panting]

39:56.394 --> 39:58.437
-Are... Are you okay? Okay.
-No, I'm not okay.

39:58.521 --> 40:00.773
First of all, this son of bitch
beams into our living room

40:00.856 --> 40:03.567
with yet another one of your brothers,
and he's talking about stopping

40:03.651 --> 40:05.778
one of your sisters
from blowing up some buildings,

40:05.861 --> 40:08.114
and I got a dead man wrapped up
in my best rug, babe.

40:08.197 --> 40:10.908
Okay. Okay, okay. Can we... Can we...
Raymond. Ray. Ray.

40:11.534 --> 40:13.202
Or we can have that shampooed.

40:14.662 --> 40:16.872
We also provide body removal services.
[chuckles]

40:16.956 --> 40:18.457
[Raymond's breath trembling]

40:18.541 --> 40:20.167
I love you, Raymond Chestnut...

40:21.961 --> 40:26.799
and I really wish I had time
for the nervous breakdown you so deserve.

40:30.094 --> 40:31.303
[Allison inhales shakily]

40:33.264 --> 40:34.348
But you have to go.

40:35.683 --> 40:36.767
I have to go.

40:39.645 --> 40:42.064
[tender instrumental music plays]

40:50.322 --> 40:52.283
[Allison takes deep breath]

41:10.259 --> 41:13.012
-[low chatter]
-[office phone rings nearby]

41:15.014 --> 41:18.100
Hey, where's that new recruit?
The shaggy hair, caveman face?

41:18.350 --> 41:20.144
[instructor] No clue, sorry.

41:20.728 --> 41:23.230
[gentle chime over speakers]

41:23.314 --> 41:26.233
[woman over PA]
Loyalty isn't a choice, it's a lifestyle.

41:30.112 --> 41:33.157
-[people cheering along street]
-[marching band plays nearby]

41:36.660 --> 41:38.245
[indistinct chatter]

41:38.329 --> 41:40.414
[Gibbs] Vanya, I don't wanna keep
doing this to you,

41:42.249 --> 41:44.543
but I have a responsibility to the public,

41:44.627 --> 41:48.130
-and I need to know who you are.
-[foreboding instrumental music plays]

41:48.214 --> 41:50.132
[Reginald] Eat up, it's getting cold.

41:50.549 --> 41:52.801
-[Vanya] I don't want it.
-I know you don't want it,

41:52.885 --> 41:54.470
but you can't pretend it doesn't exist.

41:54.553 --> 41:55.679
I'm not pretending.

41:55.763 --> 41:56.889
[Reginald] Of course you are.

41:56.972 --> 41:58.724
You choose to live in a fantasy,

41:58.807 --> 42:02.019
a land of make-believe where you don't
have to face up to who you really are.

42:02.102 --> 42:05.022
Rather than face the complexities
of your own existence,

42:05.105 --> 42:07.399
you choose to hide inside someone else's.

42:07.483 --> 42:09.735
A silly life on a silly farm.

42:14.114 --> 42:15.533
That's not meant for you.

42:17.243 --> 42:19.954
-[elevator dings]
-[foreboding instrumental music continues]

42:20.538 --> 42:22.456
-[Allison sighs]
-[doors close]

42:22.540 --> 42:24.959
-[elevator whirring]
-[Allison] I hope we find Vanya in time.

42:27.086 --> 42:30.422
You can't deny your true self any longer,
even if you are afraid.

42:30.798 --> 42:32.925
-[panting] I'm not afraid.
-[Reginald] Then eat!

42:33.884 --> 42:35.469
One more bite, and you can go.

42:35.553 --> 42:38.180
[foreboding instrumental music building]

42:46.438 --> 42:47.398
[thunder booms]

42:56.198 --> 42:57.157
[choking]

42:57.241 --> 42:59.910
[thunder crashing]

43:00.160 --> 43:01.870
[female interrogator]
What the hell is happening?

43:01.954 --> 43:03.330
[Gibbs] We've gotta stop her.

43:03.581 --> 43:05.332
[gasping]

43:05.416 --> 43:06.917
[groaning softly]

43:07.001 --> 43:08.794
[female interrogator]
You're going to have to terminate.

43:08.877 --> 43:11.130
[Gibbs] I'm trying! I'm trying!

43:11.213 --> 43:13.841
-[shuddering cries]
-[electricity crackling]

43:18.304 --> 43:19.555
[energy crackling]

43:19.638 --> 43:22.558
-[Gibbs] How is she still alive?
-[tortured moans]

43:22.641 --> 43:23.892
I remember.

43:23.976 --> 43:25.394
I remember.

43:27.271 --> 43:30.149
[energy crackling, thrumming]

43:32.860 --> 43:34.987
[rumbling, rattling]

43:35.988 --> 43:37.406
[elevator creaking]

43:37.531 --> 43:39.658
-[wind whistling]
-[elevator dings]

43:40.534 --> 43:42.494
[all grunting, gasping]

43:56.133 --> 43:57.343
[Allison cries out]

43:59.053 --> 44:00.054
[gasping]

44:02.431 --> 44:03.641
[grunts]

44:06.018 --> 44:08.354
-[shouts]
-[energy crackling]

44:10.773 --> 44:13.442
[Allison gasping]

44:14.318 --> 44:15.819
[Klaus] Question, guys.

44:16.487 --> 44:19.031
Who are we trying to save Vanya from?

44:19.114 --> 44:19.948
[both] FBI!

44:20.032 --> 44:24.161
But if they're all sucking ceiling
right now, why hasn't she stopped?

44:26.705 --> 44:29.541
[intense crackling, thrumming]

44:40.260 --> 44:43.180
[rock violin music playing]
