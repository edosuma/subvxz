WEBVTT

00:01.484 --> 00:04.314
Well, we're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:04.452 --> 00:07.248
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:07.386 --> 00:11.666
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:11.804 --> 00:14.738
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:14.876 --> 00:17.810
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:17.948 --> 00:21.538
We finally got
a piece of the pie

00:23.540 --> 00:26.026
Fish don't fry
in the kitchen

00:26.164 --> 00:28.718
Beans don't burn
on the grill

00:28.856 --> 00:31.272
Took a whole lot of tryin'

00:31.410 --> 00:34.034
Just to get up that hill

00:34.172 --> 00:36.553
Now we're up
in the big leagues

00:36.691 --> 00:39.142
Gettin' our turn at bat

00:39.280 --> 00:41.627
As long as we live,
it's you and me, baby

00:41.765 --> 00:43.353
There ain't nothin' wrong
with that

00:43.491 --> 00:46.149
We're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:46.287 --> 00:49.187
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:49.325 --> 00:53.743
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:53.881 --> 00:56.608
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:56.746 --> 00:59.611
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:59.749 --> 01:05.582
We finally got
a piece of the pie

01:13.107 --> 01:15.040
Oh, Mrs. Jefferson.
You want to
see something?

01:15.178 --> 01:16.800
My cousin just sent me
this picture.

01:16.938 --> 01:18.837
It's me and her
when we was both kids.

01:18.975 --> 01:21.667
Very nice.
But which one is you?

01:21.805 --> 01:23.152
Which one is the prettiest?

01:25.223 --> 01:26.914
Well, they're both cute.

01:27.052 --> 01:28.364
But this one
is the prettiest.

01:28.502 --> 01:29.986
That's me.

01:33.023 --> 01:35.302
It's a very nice
frame too.

01:35.440 --> 01:38.201
Yeah, I took it off one
of your old family pictures
in the closet.

01:39.271 --> 01:40.824
I figured nobody
would miss it.

01:40.962 --> 01:42.550
Florence, now,
you shouldn't have...

01:42.688 --> 01:44.034
It was a picture
of your mother-in-law.

01:44.173 --> 01:46.140
You're right.
No one will miss it.

01:47.935 --> 01:50.972
My cousin's having a
great big birthday party
this weekend.

01:51.111 --> 01:52.733
It's too bad
I can't be there.

01:52.871 --> 01:54.183
Well, why can't you?

01:54.321 --> 01:56.012
Because Mr. Jefferson
won't give me no time off.

01:56.150 --> 01:57.910
Oh, sure he will.

01:58.048 --> 01:59.498
Are we talking about
the same Mr. Jefferson

01:59.636 --> 02:00.534
I know?

02:00.672 --> 02:04.400
Skinny little dude,
about 5-foot-7?

02:04.538 --> 02:07.472
Six feet with his
mouth open?

02:07.610 --> 02:08.887
Florence!

02:09.025 --> 02:11.165
Well, he do yell a lot,
don't he?

02:11.303 --> 02:12.373
Well, not lately.

02:12.511 --> 02:14.686
Haven't you noticed
the good mood he's been in?

02:14.824 --> 02:15.997
Yeah, that's right.

02:16.136 --> 02:18.276
He's been walking around
humming and smiling.

02:18.414 --> 02:19.449
I thought he was sick.

02:20.899 --> 02:22.694
He's happy because
he's sure

02:22.832 --> 02:24.661
he's going to win
an annual award

02:24.799 --> 02:26.801
from the black businessmen's
association.

02:26.939 --> 02:27.906
What for?

02:28.044 --> 02:29.425
For community service.

02:29.563 --> 02:31.703
He's been trying
to win it for years.

02:31.841 --> 02:35.948
But this time he's sure
he's beaten his
only competition.

02:36.086 --> 02:37.502
Who's that?

02:37.640 --> 02:40.056
Did you ever hear
of Freddy's Chicken
and Waffles?

02:40.194 --> 02:41.954
Where the chicken
sticks to your ribs?

02:42.092 --> 02:45.337
And the syrup sticks
to your chicken.

02:45.475 --> 02:47.477
And when you finish,
you stick to the counter.

02:49.859 --> 02:52.275
Anyway, Freddy
just announced

02:52.413 --> 02:55.347
that he's given 10 percent
discount to senior citizens.

02:55.485 --> 02:57.107
So George topped him.

02:57.246 --> 03:00.110
He's going to give them
20 percent off
on their cleaning.

03:00.249 --> 03:03.079
You mean he's losing money
and he's still happy?

03:03.217 --> 03:05.081
That ain't
the Mr. Jefferson I know.

03:05.219 --> 03:07.946
Well, when George feels good,
I don't question it.

03:08.084 --> 03:09.534
I just enjoy it.

03:09.672 --> 03:12.399
Oh, damn, damn, damn.

03:12.537 --> 03:14.642
Now, that's
the Mr. Jefferson I know.

03:15.919 --> 03:17.335
What's the matter?

03:17.473 --> 03:19.337
That old no-good
jive turkey Freddy.

03:19.475 --> 03:21.166
Well, some people
will stoop to anything.

03:21.304 --> 03:22.374
Oh, what's he done now?

03:22.512 --> 03:23.513
You know that
old Baptist church

03:23.651 --> 03:24.997
up on Lennox Avenue,
up in Harlem?

03:25.135 --> 03:27.448
Yeah.
He's paying to have
the church repainted.

03:27.586 --> 03:29.692
Oh, isn't that awful!

03:29.830 --> 03:32.764
God will surely
punish him for that.

03:32.902 --> 03:34.593
He's even got his picture
in here. Look.

03:34.731 --> 03:35.974
See that ugly face?

03:37.251 --> 03:38.252
Oh!

03:38.390 --> 03:39.564
But why are you getting
so uptight

03:39.702 --> 03:41.117
about Freddy painting
that church?

03:41.255 --> 03:42.981
Uptight? I ain't uptight.

03:43.119 --> 03:46.122
I never heard of anything
so low-down and sneaky
in all my life.

03:46.260 --> 03:48.228
Painting a church
isn't sneaky.

03:48.366 --> 03:50.609
Well, he's doing it
behind my back, ain't he?

03:50.747 --> 03:52.197
But he's doing it
to help people.

03:52.335 --> 03:54.441
Wrong! He's doing it
to help himself.

03:54.958 --> 03:56.305
What?

03:56.443 --> 03:57.892
Look, painting that church
ain't nothing but a snow job

03:58.030 --> 03:59.377
for winning that award.

03:59.515 --> 04:01.310
You think he's just
trying to buy it?

04:01.448 --> 04:02.966
Buy it? Look, that
chicken-and-waffle turkey

04:03.104 --> 04:05.659
is stealing it from me!

04:07.419 --> 04:08.731
You know what
my problem is, Weezy?

04:08.869 --> 04:10.974
Well, you could start with...
I'm too nice.

04:11.941 --> 04:13.598
Huh?

04:13.736 --> 04:15.255
I mean, I'd never do
something like that
just to win some award.

04:15.393 --> 04:16.635
I've got some kind of...

04:16.773 --> 04:18.258
Scruples?

04:18.396 --> 04:20.018
Scruples? No,
I ain't had them
since I was a teenager.

04:21.191 --> 04:22.917
But I want that award.

04:23.055 --> 04:24.747
Well, you could still win!

04:24.885 --> 04:26.335
How?

04:26.473 --> 04:29.130
I stand a better chance
of playing center
for the Globetrotters.

04:29.269 --> 04:31.892
Don't worry
about the award.

04:32.030 --> 04:35.447
Oh, Weezy.
Just be proud that you've
still got your integrity.

04:35.585 --> 04:37.138
Integrity ain't
worth diddly.

04:38.968 --> 04:40.141
That's not true.

04:41.419 --> 04:43.110
Yeah? What did it
ever get me?

04:43.248 --> 04:45.319
A clear conscience?

04:45.457 --> 04:46.838
I mean something I can use.

04:50.635 --> 04:51.946
Oh, Mr. Jefferson?

04:52.464 --> 04:53.465
Who wants to know?

04:53.603 --> 04:54.846
The name is Philips,
Lester Philips.

04:54.984 --> 04:56.503
I'd like to talk to him
about charities.

04:56.641 --> 04:58.781
Nothing doing.
For the black
businessmen's association.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.511
I mean, he ain't
doing nothing that he
can't wait on.

05:04.649 --> 05:05.822
Come on in.

05:06.513 --> 05:07.514
Are you
the fundraiser?

05:07.652 --> 05:08.929
That's right.

05:09.067 --> 05:11.172
I'm contacting prominent
black businessmen
in this area.

05:11.311 --> 05:12.726
Oh, well, you came
to the right place.

05:12.864 --> 05:14.106
I am George Jefferson.

05:15.349 --> 05:16.316
And this is my wife,
Louise.

05:16.454 --> 05:18.697
A pleasure to meet you,
Mrs. Jefferson.

05:18.835 --> 05:20.043
Uh, can I get you
some coffee?

05:20.181 --> 05:21.631
If it's no trouble.

05:21.769 --> 05:24.531
Oh, ho trouble at all.
Go and make
a fresh pot, Weez.

05:24.669 --> 05:26.464
Me and Mr. Phillips
got to talk.

05:27.292 --> 05:28.362
Please.

05:29.846 --> 05:32.401
Uh, you're probably wondering
why I called you.

05:33.298 --> 05:34.817
You didn't call me.

05:34.955 --> 05:37.198
Oh, yeah,
but I was about to.

05:37.337 --> 05:38.648
Yeah, I heard
about this dude

05:38.786 --> 05:40.926
that was paying
to have this
church repainted.

05:41.064 --> 05:42.756
You mean Freddy,
the chicken-and-waffle king.

05:42.894 --> 05:44.516
That's him.

05:44.654 --> 05:46.691
Yeah, I was the one
who spoke to him about
making a contribution.

05:46.829 --> 05:47.795
Oh, yeah?

05:47.933 --> 05:49.763
Yeah, a very generous
human being.

05:49.901 --> 05:51.765
He sure is.

05:51.903 --> 05:54.181
How generous?
What?

05:54.319 --> 05:56.425
Well, I mean, I was
planning on making
a contribution myself

05:56.563 --> 05:59.151
and I just wanted to get
sort of a ballpark figure.

05:59.289 --> 06:01.326
I mean, how much did
good old Freddy lay down

06:01.464 --> 06:02.776
to have this
church repainted?

06:02.914 --> 06:03.915
Seven hundred dollars.

06:04.053 --> 06:06.504
Seven hundred dollars?
That's chump change.

06:07.608 --> 06:09.610
I pledge 710.

06:13.303 --> 06:15.167
And he also
gave another 700

06:15.305 --> 06:17.100
to buy wheelchairs
for the handicapped.

06:17.238 --> 06:19.482
That comes to 1400.

06:19.620 --> 06:21.726
Okay, put me down
for 1410.

06:24.073 --> 06:26.593
That will be enough
to put new hubcaps
on them wheelchairs.

06:27.904 --> 06:30.907
You overwhelm me,
Mr. Jefferson.
Thank you.

06:31.045 --> 06:33.738
Oh, you wouldn't have
any books you'd
like to give us?

06:33.876 --> 06:35.774
Books?
For Freddy's library.

06:35.912 --> 06:38.984
He also gave another 600
for the college library.

06:39.122 --> 06:41.884
Look, how much
did this turkey
put down altogether?

06:42.540 --> 06:43.506
Two thousand dollars.

06:43.644 --> 06:45.197
Okay, I'm gonna
put the game on ice.

06:45.335 --> 06:47.821
I pledge three grand
to any project you name.

06:47.959 --> 06:49.167
Mr. Jefferson,

06:49.305 --> 06:51.480
you're an exceptionally
generous human being.

06:51.618 --> 06:53.240
It's my only fault.

06:56.036 --> 06:58.452
Now, there is an old
closed-down youth center

06:58.590 --> 07:00.316
on 123rd street in Harlem.

07:00.454 --> 07:03.077
What would you say
to using your money
to reopen it?

07:03.215 --> 07:04.803
A youth center?

07:04.941 --> 07:07.357
Oh, yeah, kids, eh?
That's a great idea.

07:07.496 --> 07:09.221
Then I can count
on your contribution?

07:09.359 --> 07:11.534
Sure! I'll check
with my accountant.

07:11.672 --> 07:14.019
And you can come back
in a couple of days
and pick it up.

07:14.710 --> 07:16.436
Here's the coffee.

07:17.091 --> 07:18.576
Thank you, Mrs. Jefferson.

07:19.542 --> 07:21.441
I guess you
find fundraising

07:21.579 --> 07:24.029
a very fulfilling profession,
Mr. Phillips.

07:24.167 --> 07:26.307
That's right,
you go around
fulfilling your pockets

07:26.446 --> 07:27.861
with other people's money.

07:30.484 --> 07:32.590
Now, this isn't
my profession,
Mrs. Jefferson.

07:32.728 --> 07:35.558
I'm just a businessman
like Mr. Jefferson here

07:35.696 --> 07:37.387
willing to do my part.

07:37.526 --> 07:39.010
You should be complimented.

07:39.148 --> 07:40.494
Not me.

07:40.632 --> 07:42.703
It's men like your husband
who deserve the compliments

07:42.841 --> 07:44.084
for their contributions.

07:44.981 --> 07:46.535
Contributions?

07:46.673 --> 07:49.365
Oh, Weezy, Mr. Phillips
has many more
appointments to make.

07:49.503 --> 07:50.987
Well, I do have
a couple, but...

07:51.125 --> 07:52.299
We won't keep you
any longer.

07:52.437 --> 07:54.474
Yes, well, I hate to leave
in such a rush.

07:54.612 --> 07:55.716
Oh, look, don't apologize.

07:55.854 --> 07:57.787
I know how helping people
can keep you busy.

07:58.132 --> 07:59.340
Bye.

08:00.100 --> 08:01.895
Ah!

08:02.689 --> 08:03.862
Nice guy.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.588
Too bad he couldn't
stay longer.

08:07.107 --> 08:08.798
How much did
you give, George?

08:08.936 --> 08:10.248
Oh, I just gave
a little something

08:10.386 --> 08:12.664
to help reopen
the youth center
up in Harlem.

08:12.802 --> 08:14.079
How much is
"a little something"?

08:14.217 --> 08:16.254
Oh, $3000.

08:19.947 --> 08:21.501
$3000?

08:22.225 --> 08:23.779
What's wrong with you?

08:23.917 --> 08:27.230
I'd like to know
what's behind this
sudden burst of charity.

08:27.368 --> 08:29.750
Nothing. I'm just
a soft touch.

08:29.888 --> 08:32.373
And what I'm doing
is going to help
some kids, right?

08:33.616 --> 08:36.654
Well, a youth center
would help.

08:36.792 --> 08:39.553
Oh, I'm sorry
I misjudged you, George.

08:39.691 --> 08:41.106
Your heart's
in the right place.

08:41.244 --> 08:42.418
Of course it is.

08:42.556 --> 08:44.420
You can see it,
I can see it,

08:44.558 --> 08:46.353
and them judges
on that award committee
are gonna see it,

08:46.491 --> 08:47.906
because I am going to win.

08:48.044 --> 08:49.149
Ha!

08:53.671 --> 08:55.120
Hey, Florence.

08:55.258 --> 08:57.571
I'm taking Weezy out,
so you don't have to
cook dinner.

08:57.709 --> 08:58.917
Oh, I didn't bother
to cook dinner.

08:59.055 --> 09:00.540
I'm visiting
my cousin tonight.

09:00.678 --> 09:02.472
You ain't going nowhere
till you bring out champagne.

09:02.611 --> 09:04.336
We celebrating.
Hey, Weezy!

09:04.751 --> 09:06.028
Oh, we are?

09:06.166 --> 09:08.651
Ain't that nice!
A going-away party for me.

09:08.789 --> 09:10.791
Not me-and-you "We,"
Me-and-Weezy "We."

09:10.929 --> 09:12.413
Weezy!

09:12.552 --> 09:14.692
Okay, okay,
I'm coming, George.
Ha-ha!

09:14.830 --> 09:16.072
I've got something
to show you.

09:16.210 --> 09:18.005
I know you're going to
find this very interesting.

09:20.283 --> 09:23.045
"Alligators found
in New York sewers"?

09:23.183 --> 09:24.425
Not that, this.

09:27.325 --> 09:30.086
"Jefferson to reopen
youth center in Harlem."

09:30.915 --> 09:31.916
That's nice.

09:32.054 --> 09:33.883
And you know
what the best part
of it is?

09:34.021 --> 09:35.195
They spelled
your name right?

09:35.333 --> 09:37.266
No, the timing.

09:37.404 --> 09:39.993
I got my story printed
the same day the
awards committee votes.

09:40.441 --> 09:41.408
Wonderful.

09:41.546 --> 09:42.996
Weezy, what is
wrong with you?

09:43.134 --> 09:44.998
I thought you'd be proud
of what I'm doing.

09:45.136 --> 09:48.898
George, it's not
what you're doing
that's wrong, it's why.

09:49.036 --> 09:50.175
You wouldn't be
helping those kids

09:50.313 --> 09:51.798
if there wasn't
something in it for you.

09:51.936 --> 09:53.385
What difference
does it make?

09:53.523 --> 09:55.249
They're getting
a youth center,
I'm getting an award.

09:55.387 --> 09:56.492
Everybody gets fat.
Come on.

09:56.630 --> 09:58.839
I'm taking you out to dinner.
But...

09:58.977 --> 10:01.462
I got us some of that
bubbly stuff,
Mrs. Jefferson.

10:01.601 --> 10:04.293
Oh, I don't feel like
drinking anything, Florence.

10:04.431 --> 10:05.777
I know what
you mean, child.

10:05.915 --> 10:07.089
That's why
I don't drink no more.

10:11.058 --> 10:12.957
Of course, I don't drink
no less, neither.

10:20.550 --> 10:21.759
Hello?

10:22.173 --> 10:23.623
Yes?

10:24.693 --> 10:26.349
I see.

10:27.178 --> 10:28.455
All right, I'll tell him.

10:28.800 --> 10:30.457
Goodbye.

10:30.595 --> 10:32.632
I'll take some
of that champagne now,
Florence.

10:32.770 --> 10:33.874
But you just said...

10:34.012 --> 10:35.565
That was someone
from the awards committee.

10:35.704 --> 10:37.015
The voting is over.

10:37.153 --> 10:39.086
Oh, and you'll have a drink
to celebrate.

10:39.224 --> 10:40.605
No, to get up
my courage.

10:40.743 --> 10:43.194
I have to tell George
he lost.

10:54.584 --> 10:57.587
Hey! You popped the cork
on the champagne,
Florence. Good.

10:57.726 --> 11:00.349
That ain't nothing
compared to the cork
that's going to pop.

11:02.075 --> 11:03.421
What's she yapping about?

11:03.559 --> 11:05.630
George, we have to
have a little talk.

11:05.768 --> 11:07.183
We'll have
a lot of talk over dinner.

11:07.321 --> 11:09.047
Come on. Get dressed.
We're gonna
have a good time.

11:09.185 --> 11:10.290
Ha!

11:13.845 --> 11:15.157
Wanna bet?

11:15.916 --> 11:17.746
What is her problem?

11:17.884 --> 11:19.955
George, I have something
to tell you

11:20.093 --> 11:21.646
but I don't quite know
how to do it.

11:21.784 --> 11:23.061
You start by opening
your mouth.

11:24.166 --> 11:25.477
But I don't want you
to get mad.

11:25.615 --> 11:27.065
Weezy, do I look like
I'm mad?

11:27.203 --> 11:28.135
No, but...

11:28.273 --> 11:29.585
Well, then,
get to the point.

11:29.723 --> 11:31.967
What have you done
that is going to
make me mad?

11:32.105 --> 11:33.554
I...

11:33.693 --> 11:34.624
I'll get the door.

11:34.763 --> 11:36.247
No. Florence!
FLORENCE: Yes?

11:36.385 --> 11:38.249
There's the doorbell,
dumbbell.

11:40.527 --> 11:43.185
FLORENCE: Well, then,
some dumbbell
better answer it.

11:45.739 --> 11:46.878
You know, it's terrible
when you think

11:47.016 --> 11:49.018
of all the animals
that are becoming extinct

11:49.156 --> 11:51.055
and we still
can't get rid of her.

11:52.194 --> 11:55.576
Oh, Mr. J, I just had
to tell you, I'm moved.

11:55.715 --> 11:58.096
Oh, wow, Bentley.
You leaving
the neighborhood?

11:58.234 --> 11:59.857
Oh, no, nothing
of the sort.

11:59.995 --> 12:01.962
What I meant was,
I'm touched.

12:02.100 --> 12:03.861
Look, nobody's perfect.

12:03.999 --> 12:06.104
You're just a little weird,
that's all.

12:07.588 --> 12:10.453
George, I don't think
you know what
Mr. Bentley is saying.

12:10.591 --> 12:11.938
I know what he's saying.

12:12.939 --> 12:14.285
What are you saying,
Bentley?

12:15.251 --> 12:17.081
Simply that
I was moved emotionally

12:17.219 --> 12:19.324
after reading the story
about you in the newspaper.

12:19.462 --> 12:21.395
You are a man
of rare compassion.

12:21.533 --> 12:23.397
Oh, yeah,
I guess I am, ain't I?

12:23.535 --> 12:25.192
As a matter of fact,
you've inspired me.

12:25.330 --> 12:27.401
I'd like to join
your youth center.

12:28.161 --> 12:29.990
You're too old, Bentley.

12:30.128 --> 12:31.889
I mean, I'd like
to help out there.

12:32.027 --> 12:33.683
Why? You ain't black.

12:33.822 --> 12:35.547
George, you don't have
to be black

12:35.685 --> 12:37.342
to help those kids
in Harlem.

12:37.480 --> 12:39.103
I know that, Weezy,

12:39.241 --> 12:41.312
but them kids aren't gonna
understand a word
Bentley's saying.

12:41.450 --> 12:44.384
No offense, Bentley,
but you do speak
some funny English.

12:45.523 --> 12:47.076
Couldn't I assist
in some way?

12:47.214 --> 12:48.595
That's why I got
the old ball out.

12:48.733 --> 12:51.736
I'd love to teach those lads
the finer points of soccer.

12:51.874 --> 12:53.876
Do you know anything
about soccer, Mr. J.?

12:54.014 --> 12:56.292
Well, there's Florence.
I'd sure like to sock her.

12:57.984 --> 13:00.641
Actually, soccer's becoming
increasingly popular
in the states.

13:01.815 --> 13:03.023
Are you kidding?

13:03.161 --> 13:04.956
Those kids wouldn't play
no sissy game like that.

13:05.094 --> 13:07.925
Sissy? My word,
soccer's a rough sport, Mr. J.

13:08.063 --> 13:09.478
I know. I've played it.

13:09.616 --> 13:11.618
The players wear no padding,
no helmets.

13:11.756 --> 13:14.483
You get knocked down,
stepped on,
kicked in the head...

13:14.621 --> 13:15.691
Oh, so that's
what happened to you.

13:18.211 --> 13:19.937
Actually, I used to be
pretty good at the game.

13:20.075 --> 13:21.490
Hey! Watch it!

13:21.628 --> 13:23.733
Just darting
down the wings...

13:23.872 --> 13:25.114
Be careful!

13:25.252 --> 13:28.704
And then passing
to the center!

13:30.119 --> 13:32.673
Well, the center
was supposed to get that.

13:33.191 --> 13:34.330
Sorry.

13:34.468 --> 13:37.299
Uh, Isn't that supposed
to be played outdoors?

13:37.437 --> 13:39.749
Exactly. It'll be splendid
for the lads.

13:39.888 --> 13:42.166
The fresh air,
the green grass,
the running about...

13:42.304 --> 13:43.892
Look, Bentley,
them kids up in Harlem

13:44.030 --> 13:45.100
ain't got no fresh air.

13:45.238 --> 13:46.687
They ain't never seen
no green grass.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.206
Only time
they get a chance to run

13:48.344 --> 13:49.759
is when the cops
is chasing them.

13:51.244 --> 13:53.625
Well, I still think
they'd get a boot
out of the game.

13:53.763 --> 13:55.455
Do you get it? Boot?

13:55.593 --> 13:57.008
Also, it would teach them
to use their heads.

14:01.185 --> 14:02.945
How far can you
kick this ball?

14:03.083 --> 14:05.672
Oh, a long way,
but I couldn't
show you in here.

14:05.810 --> 14:07.329
Oh. Could you show me
in the hall?

14:07.467 --> 14:09.020
I'd be glad to.
Good.

14:11.367 --> 14:12.852
You see, what you do is...

14:14.198 --> 14:16.545
Come on, Weezy.
Get dressed.
I'm starving.

14:18.340 --> 14:21.515
George, isn't it wonderful
what happens when you
get involved?

14:21.653 --> 14:22.758
Yeah, it sure is,

14:22.896 --> 14:24.035
and right now
I'd love to be involved

14:24.173 --> 14:26.175
with a big, thick,
juicy steak.

14:26.313 --> 14:28.074
But even if you didn't win,

14:28.212 --> 14:31.042
you would still want
to reopen that youth center,
wouldn't you?

14:31.180 --> 14:33.493
Weezy, Weezy, Weezy.

14:33.631 --> 14:35.115
The youth center
and me winning the award

14:35.253 --> 14:36.703
ain't got nothing
to do with each other.

14:36.841 --> 14:38.429
Oh, I'm sure glad
to hear that.

14:38.567 --> 14:39.809
Good, now get dressed.

14:39.948 --> 14:41.742
Because you didn't win.

14:43.813 --> 14:44.884
Say what?

14:46.126 --> 14:47.714
I got a call
from Bill Robison,

14:47.852 --> 14:49.440
your friend
on the awards committee.

14:49.578 --> 14:51.752
He said it won't be announced
until tomorrow,

14:51.891 --> 14:53.478
but they've already
voted and...

14:53.616 --> 14:54.928
I lost.

14:55.066 --> 14:57.758
George, George, George.

14:57.897 --> 15:00.347
There are no losers
in a thing like this.

15:00.485 --> 15:02.315
Well, did I win the award?
No.

15:02.453 --> 15:03.661
Then I lost.

15:04.834 --> 15:06.595
It wasn't a game, George.

15:06.733 --> 15:08.493
How could they
do this to me?

15:08.631 --> 15:10.875
They didn't do
anything to you.

15:11.013 --> 15:12.635
The committee
just voted for the man

15:12.773 --> 15:14.258
they felt was
most deserving.

15:14.396 --> 15:16.225
No, they didn't,
otherwise I'd have won.

15:17.606 --> 15:19.125
I wonder who they
gave it to.

15:19.263 --> 15:20.264
He didn't say.

15:20.402 --> 15:21.610
Then it's got to be Freddy.

15:21.748 --> 15:24.061
I just know Freddy
catered that judges'
award meeting

15:24.199 --> 15:27.305
with his old greasy chicken
and those soggy waffles.

15:29.929 --> 15:33.967
George, what really counts
is the good deeds you did.

15:34.105 --> 15:35.796
You talking
about the youth center?

15:35.935 --> 15:37.867
Luckily that's one good deed
I ain't done yet,

15:38.006 --> 15:40.215
and that's one deed
that ain't gonna get did.

15:41.285 --> 15:42.769
But you promised!

15:42.907 --> 15:44.219
Look, Weezy, I'll make you
another promise too.

15:44.357 --> 15:47.049
I'm not tossing around
no 3000 dead presidents
for nothing.

15:52.054 --> 15:54.125
So the youth center's
nothing, huh?

15:54.263 --> 15:56.334
Well, it ain't no award,
that's for sure.

15:56.472 --> 15:57.818
Forget that award!

15:57.957 --> 15:59.199
Forget about it?
Weezy, look,

15:59.337 --> 16:00.614
Freddy bought
that award, Weezy.

16:00.752 --> 16:02.375
I think that is disgusting.

16:07.242 --> 16:08.657
Well, goodbye, y'all.

16:08.795 --> 16:09.865
Where are you going?

16:10.003 --> 16:11.004
Is he my daddy?

16:11.280 --> 16:12.281
No.

16:13.662 --> 16:15.491
Then where I'm going
ain't none of his business.

16:17.286 --> 16:18.908
Where is she going?

16:19.047 --> 16:21.325
Well, you told her
she could take a couple
of days off, remember?

16:21.463 --> 16:23.913
I changed my mind.
Get back in the kitchen
and start cooking dinner.

16:24.052 --> 16:25.743
But you said
we were going out
to dinner.

16:25.881 --> 16:27.124
I changed my mind
about that too.

16:27.262 --> 16:29.643
Well, I ain't changed
my mind.

16:30.506 --> 16:31.714
I'm going to catch my bus.

16:31.852 --> 16:34.096
You are staying here!
This is your boss talking.

16:34.234 --> 16:35.787
Like hell I am.

16:37.789 --> 16:39.205
And that's
the champagne talking,

16:39.343 --> 16:40.965
because Florence don't cuss.

16:50.975 --> 16:53.529
I wonder if it's legal
to kill a maid.

16:55.566 --> 16:57.602
George, what about
keeping your promise

16:57.740 --> 16:59.535
about reopening
that youth center?

16:59.673 --> 17:02.331
Look, Weezy, if I did that,
I'd be worse than Freddy.

17:02.469 --> 17:04.264
You'll have to explain
that one to me.

17:04.402 --> 17:06.577
Freddy did all those things
just to buy the award,
didn't he?

17:07.336 --> 17:08.751
Well, yes, I suppose so.

17:08.889 --> 17:11.133
And winning the award
is a lot better than
losing it?

17:11.271 --> 17:12.721
Of course.
Okay.

17:12.859 --> 17:14.378
Now, if I did
some good things
just to lose the award,

17:14.516 --> 17:16.276
that's worse than
doing them to win it.

17:19.555 --> 17:21.833
You sure cleared that up.

17:21.971 --> 17:23.732
Good.

17:25.423 --> 17:27.736
And this subject is closed,
understand?

17:27.874 --> 17:30.773
Yes, George.
Just like the doors
of the youth center.

17:34.398 --> 17:37.642
Hey there, Mr. Jefferson.

17:37.780 --> 17:38.988
How do you know my name?

17:39.127 --> 17:40.956
Because the lady I met
in the elevator told me

17:41.094 --> 17:43.648
if a funny-looking dude
came and answered the door,

17:43.786 --> 17:45.478
it's George Jefferson.

17:45.616 --> 17:46.858
I'm going to
kill that Florence.

17:46.996 --> 17:48.550
She bugs me
even when she ain't here.

17:49.206 --> 17:50.379
But she was wrong.

17:50.517 --> 17:51.967
You ain't really
funny-looking.

17:52.105 --> 17:53.934
Good.
I'd say grumpy, maybe.

17:54.073 --> 17:56.075
Or, like,
spaced out or...

17:56.213 --> 17:57.145
What's on your mind, kid?

17:57.283 --> 17:59.354
Sitting down.

18:00.251 --> 18:01.735
Can I come in?
No.

18:01.873 --> 18:04.497
George!
That's no way to talk.

18:04.635 --> 18:06.671
Hello. I'm Mrs. Jefferson.
Can I help you?

18:06.809 --> 18:09.571
Yeah, I'm Jason King
of the gypsies.

18:09.709 --> 18:11.331
He's lying, Weezy.

18:11.469 --> 18:13.575
The king of the gypsies
is an old man
with rings in his ears.

18:14.472 --> 18:16.647
King is my name, man.

18:16.785 --> 18:19.339
The gypsies is my gang
up in Harlem.

18:19.477 --> 18:21.134
Uh, what do you want, Jason?

18:21.272 --> 18:23.171
I've got something
to deliver.

18:23.309 --> 18:24.620
Come in.
Weezy!

18:24.758 --> 18:25.932
Come in, Jason.

18:27.071 --> 18:28.728
Say!

18:28.866 --> 18:30.626
Whoo!

18:31.903 --> 18:34.354
This is some crib
you've got here.

18:34.492 --> 18:37.392
Whoo! This is all right.

18:37.530 --> 18:38.807
Look, Jackson.

18:38.945 --> 18:40.705
Jason.
Oh!

18:40.843 --> 18:42.500
Jason. What do you want?

18:42.638 --> 18:45.124
Uh, we used to live
in Harlem too, you know.

18:45.262 --> 18:48.299
With all your bread?
You've got to be kidding.

18:48.437 --> 18:50.163
We didn't have money then.

18:50.301 --> 18:53.028
Oh? Well, what did you do?

18:53.166 --> 18:55.582
Knock over some bank?

18:55.720 --> 18:57.653
Look, king gypsy,
whatever you call yourself,

18:57.791 --> 18:59.448
what do you want?

18:59.586 --> 19:01.140
Well...
Some ice cream, maybe?

19:01.278 --> 19:02.762
Yeah.
Weezy!

19:03.935 --> 19:06.662
Doesn't he remind you
of Lionel, George,

19:06.800 --> 19:08.112
when we used to live
in Harlem?

19:08.250 --> 19:09.596
No, because Lionel
had better sense

19:09.734 --> 19:11.771
than to go around
bothering strangers.

19:11.909 --> 19:13.221
I'll get the ice cream.

19:13.359 --> 19:14.843
Uh, hmm...

19:14.981 --> 19:16.948
I only eat chocolate.

19:17.086 --> 19:19.123
I think we have
a couple of scoops left.

19:19.261 --> 19:21.746
Hey! I was saving that
for after supper.

19:29.789 --> 19:30.997
Here.

19:31.135 --> 19:32.136
What's that?

19:32.274 --> 19:34.483
It ain't going
to bite you. Read it.

19:41.076 --> 19:44.528
"To George Jefferson
from the 123rd street gypsies,

19:44.666 --> 19:46.840
"because he cared about us."

19:50.568 --> 19:52.087
This is for me?

19:52.225 --> 19:54.952
See, nobody else cared
about the youth center.

19:55.090 --> 19:57.092
Then we heard about
all the stuff you was doing,

19:57.230 --> 20:01.061
so, well, you okay by us.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.616
Grumpy, but still okay,
you know?

20:05.411 --> 20:07.275
Hey, you all right?

20:07.723 --> 20:09.794
Uh...

20:09.932 --> 20:11.693
You came all the way
down here to
bring me this?

20:11.831 --> 20:13.695
Yep. Phew.

20:15.006 --> 20:17.181
Hey, you know, that Lionel,
he sure is lucky

20:17.319 --> 20:18.838
to have an old man like you.

20:19.425 --> 20:21.012
Think so, huh?

20:22.600 --> 20:24.844
Hey, hey, hey.
Are you okay?

20:24.982 --> 20:26.155
Yeah, I'm cool.

20:26.294 --> 20:27.812
Uh...

20:27.950 --> 20:30.332
Your father's lucky
to have a son like you too.

20:30.470 --> 20:32.852
Oh, my old man died
when I was 10.

20:32.990 --> 20:36.476
Oh, yeah? My father died
when I was a kid.

20:36.614 --> 20:38.375
But I managed to do
all right for myself.

20:40.100 --> 20:41.964
Yeah.

20:42.102 --> 20:43.725
Hey, you know,
when I get rich,

20:43.863 --> 20:45.554
I think I'm going
to help people out too.

20:45.692 --> 20:48.523
I mean, that's what
having money's
all about, right?

20:49.834 --> 20:52.009
Yeah. Sure is.

20:52.147 --> 20:53.631
Hey, Weezy,

20:53.769 --> 20:54.908
look what Jason
and the gypsies gave me

20:55.046 --> 20:56.703
because of that
youth center.

20:57.532 --> 20:59.430
It's beautiful.

20:59.568 --> 21:01.536
It really is.

21:01.674 --> 21:03.917
But didn't George
tell you?

21:04.055 --> 21:05.505
I'm afraid he's decided...

21:05.643 --> 21:07.645
To put even more money
into the center.

21:11.442 --> 21:12.547
But, George...

21:12.685 --> 21:14.721
And don't try to talk me
out of it, Weezy.

21:14.859 --> 21:16.930
Hey! You really gonna do
a number on that center,
ain't you?

21:17.068 --> 21:18.138
Look, when George Jefferson
does something,

21:18.277 --> 21:19.416
he does it up right.

21:19.554 --> 21:20.624
All right!

21:20.762 --> 21:23.523
Sooner or later.
Huh?

21:23.661 --> 21:26.388
Jason, I have a big bowl
of ice cream
in the kitchen for you.

21:26.802 --> 21:28.183
Oh!

21:29.218 --> 21:30.150
Chocolate?

21:30.289 --> 21:31.220
Chocolate.

21:31.359 --> 21:32.877
Well, all right!

21:42.059 --> 21:43.060
Oh, George,

21:43.198 --> 21:46.581
how come you always manage
to surprise me?

21:46.719 --> 21:48.168
I mean, you're supposed
to help people.

21:48.307 --> 21:49.998
That's what having money's
all about.

21:51.551 --> 21:54.382
Well, I'm sure glad
one of us thinks that way,
George.

21:54.830 --> 21:55.866
Thank you.

21:56.867 --> 21:58.282
Hey! Come on in.

21:59.456 --> 22:00.767
Hello, Mrs. Jefferson.

22:01.665 --> 22:04.219
Well, I guess you know
why I'm here.

22:04.357 --> 22:06.739
That donation we discussed?
$3000 wasn't it?

22:06.877 --> 22:07.843
Wrong, Philips.

22:07.981 --> 22:09.051
I told you to
come here tonight

22:09.189 --> 22:11.191
but it wasn't to pick up
no three grand.

22:11.330 --> 22:13.297
I'm upping the ante.
Oh.

22:13.435 --> 22:14.919
Oh, George!

22:15.057 --> 22:16.852
I've already
made up my mind, Weezy.

22:18.129 --> 22:19.648
By the way,
Mr. Jefferson,

22:19.786 --> 22:21.340
since the youth center
is your project,

22:21.478 --> 22:23.790
the people up there
felt it should be
named after you.

22:23.928 --> 22:25.792
Isn't that a nice idea?

22:25.930 --> 22:27.967
No, it ain't.
It's not?

22:28.105 --> 22:29.969
I want to name it after
the person who's responsible

22:30.107 --> 22:32.281
for me being as successful
as I am today,

22:32.420 --> 22:33.559
somebody who taught me

22:33.697 --> 22:35.354
that winning is
a lot more fun than losing.

22:36.562 --> 22:37.977
Who's that, George?

22:38.115 --> 22:39.392
My dad.

22:40.428 --> 22:44.086
Oh. Well,
that's nice too.

22:44.224 --> 22:46.986
Tell them they can call it
the William Jefferson
youth center.

22:47.124 --> 22:49.091
What a nice memorial.

22:49.851 --> 22:51.956
Three thousand and ten?

22:55.719 --> 22:57.445
You're very generous.

22:59.516 --> 23:00.724
Of course I am.

23:00.862 --> 23:02.104
More generous
than that Freddy,

23:02.242 --> 23:03.934
even if he did
win the award.

23:04.072 --> 23:05.314
Oh, Freddy
didn't win that.

23:05.901 --> 23:07.386
He didn't?
No.

23:07.524 --> 23:09.111
The committee went
a different way this year.

23:09.249 --> 23:10.285
Instead of picking
the businessman

23:10.423 --> 23:11.631
who donated the most money,

23:11.769 --> 23:12.805
they looked for the man

23:12.943 --> 23:15.324
who donated
most of his personal time.

23:15.463 --> 23:16.567
Why didn't I
think of that?

23:16.705 --> 23:18.120
Giving time
is a lot cheaper.

23:18.258 --> 23:20.364
Maybe you'll think of it
next year.

23:20.502 --> 23:21.676
I've got to be going.

23:21.814 --> 23:23.781
Oh, hey, look,
how did the winner
do it?

23:23.919 --> 23:25.645
What did he do,
spend a lot of weekends
with the kids

23:25.783 --> 23:26.991
teaching them basketball
and stuff like that?

23:27.129 --> 23:29.062
No, he just went around
talking to people.

23:29.200 --> 23:30.788
You're jiving.
Who is this dude?

23:31.271 --> 23:32.618
Me.

23:34.758 --> 23:36.000
And thanks for
helping me win.

23:36.138 --> 23:37.933
I couldn't have done it
without you.

23:45.769 --> 23:49.013
Hey, you got any cake
to go with this ice cream?

23:49.151 --> 23:51.119
Forget the cake.
You're going out
to dinner with us.

23:51.257 --> 23:52.431
Dinner!

23:52.569 --> 23:55.606
Well, all right!

24:24.773 --> 24:29.295
LOUISE: The Jeffersons was
videotaped in front of
a studio audience.
