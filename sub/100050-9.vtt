00:07.659 --> 00:10.662
Previously onYoung Sheldon...We've never really discussed

00:10.706 --> 00:13.056
the status
of our relationship.

00:13.100 --> 00:14.710
Men don't break up with me.

00:14.753 --> 00:16.494
Ido the breaking up.

00:16.538 --> 00:17.495
STURGIS:
So, uh,

00:17.539 --> 00:18.801
how's Connie?

00:18.844 --> 00:21.325
Hit him!

00:21.369 --> 00:22.413
Hit him again.

00:22.457 --> 00:23.719
Mom's good.

00:23.762 --> 00:26.113
I'm glad she's doing well.
Tell her I say hi.

00:26.156 --> 00:28.071
Or wait, greetings.

00:28.115 --> 00:29.681
Greetings from John.

00:29.725 --> 00:31.683
Hey, can I talk to you?

00:31.727 --> 00:33.729
You tell my granddaughter
she can't play baseball?

00:33.772 --> 00:35.644
I was just looking out
for her, that's all.

00:35.687 --> 00:37.559
Well, you and me are
gonna have problems.

00:37.602 --> 00:39.561
MISSY:
Meemaw got a date
with the coach.

00:39.604 --> 00:42.477
What?It was a productive afternoon.

00:47.699 --> 00:49.701
ADULT SHELDON:
Before that disembodied voice

00:49.745 --> 00:52.443
on AOL started saying,
"You've got mail,"

00:52.487 --> 00:54.402
we relied on my mom.

00:54.445 --> 00:57.100
Shelly, you've got mail!

00:57.144 --> 00:58.841
ADULT SHELDON:
Some mail brought great joy. Ooh!

00:58.884 --> 01:01.278
Greetings, Mr. Spock.

01:01.322 --> 01:03.454
ADULT SHELDON:
Some mail brought pain.

01:03.498 --> 01:05.543
George, you got jury duty!

01:05.587 --> 01:08.111
GEORGE SR.:
Tell 'em I died!

01:08.155 --> 01:09.808
ADULT SHELDON:
And one time...

01:09.852 --> 01:12.202
Missy, you got something.

01:12.246 --> 01:15.031
...mail caused a war
between neighbors

01:15.075 --> 01:17.425
rivaling that
of the Klingon Empire

01:17.468 --> 01:20.732
and the Federation, which--
trust me-- was a doozy.

01:20.776 --> 01:22.082
What'd you get?

01:22.125 --> 01:24.214
An invitation
to Billy's birthday party.

01:24.258 --> 01:25.955
That's nice.

01:25.998 --> 01:28.566
I wonder where Sheldon's is.

01:29.741 --> 01:30.960
MARY:
Hey, Brenda. It's Mary.

01:31.003 --> 01:32.701
Oh, hey.MARY: So,

01:32.744 --> 01:35.225
we got Missy's invitation
to Billy's party.

01:35.269 --> 01:36.792
Great. Hope she can make it.

01:36.835 --> 01:39.099
But Sheldon's didn't arrive
for some reason.

01:39.142 --> 01:40.665
Maybe it got lost in the mail?

01:40.709 --> 01:42.232
It didn't get lost.

01:42.276 --> 01:44.016
What are you saying?

01:44.060 --> 01:46.454
I think you know
what I'm saying.

01:46.497 --> 01:49.021
So Sheldon isn't invited?

01:49.065 --> 01:50.458
See? You knew. Bye.

02:11.392 --> 02:14.177
All right, Moon Pie.
I'll see you after class.

02:14.221 --> 02:15.700
Aren't you going
to walk me in?

02:15.744 --> 02:17.224
I think you can manage it.

02:17.267 --> 02:19.226
Is it because you're trying
to avoid Dr. Sturgis?

02:19.269 --> 02:21.141
No.
Is it because
you're getting old,

02:21.184 --> 02:24.187
and you're trying to limit
the number of steps you take?Get in there.

02:24.231 --> 02:25.362
Connie.

02:25.406 --> 02:28.148
Oh, hello, John.

02:28.191 --> 02:29.584
It's nice to see you.

02:29.627 --> 02:31.803
It's nice to see you, too.I assumed

02:31.847 --> 02:33.805
you stopped bringing
Sheldon to class

02:33.849 --> 02:36.591
'cause you were worried it would
be awkward running into me

02:36.634 --> 02:38.245
after our breakup.SHELDON: I asked her
the same question,

02:38.288 --> 02:40.725
but she assured me
that wasn't the case.

02:40.769 --> 02:42.162
What a relief!

02:42.205 --> 02:45.034
So, I suppose I'll
see you after class?

02:45.077 --> 02:47.210
I suppose you will.

02:47.254 --> 02:50.126
Now, didn't she used to
walk you to your seat?

02:50.170 --> 02:51.997
She did,
but she was younger then.

02:52.041 --> 02:54.174
That makes sense.

02:54.217 --> 02:56.611
Sheldon and Billy
are friends.

02:56.654 --> 02:58.743
My son should be at his party.

02:58.787 --> 03:00.615
Look,

03:00.658 --> 03:03.139
I'm not trying
to be mean here.

03:03.183 --> 03:05.620
Billy has a tough enough
time with other kids

03:05.663 --> 03:08.579
without them seeing him pal
around with the local weirdo.

03:08.623 --> 03:10.668
I thought you weren't
trying to be mean.

03:10.712 --> 03:12.844
That was the nicest
way I could say it.

03:12.888 --> 03:16.108
Well, I'm not trying
to be mean here either,

03:16.152 --> 03:20.069
but you are behaving
very unneighborly.

03:20.112 --> 03:21.984
That was mean?

03:22.027 --> 03:24.247
You're darn tootin'.Tootin'?

03:24.291 --> 03:26.945
Tootin'!
Okay.

03:26.989 --> 03:29.948
So if Einstein's analysis
of time is correct,

03:29.992 --> 03:31.776
the future's already happened,

03:31.820 --> 03:34.866
but we'll discuss that
in more detail next week.

03:34.910 --> 03:38.087
Or perhaps we already have.Exactly.

03:38.130 --> 03:40.307
Good one. Let's hit the road.

03:40.350 --> 03:41.612
It was nice seeing you, Connie.

03:41.656 --> 03:45.268
Uh, we should get coffee
sometime and catch up.

03:45.312 --> 03:49.577
Maybe, sure, yeah. We'll see.

03:49.620 --> 03:51.535
What about, uh,
tomorrow morning?

03:51.579 --> 03:54.408
Oh, that's not great for me.

03:54.451 --> 03:56.975
Well, what about Sunday?

03:57.019 --> 03:59.891
Mm, I can't do that either.
Maybe another time.

03:59.935 --> 04:02.851
Oh, I see.

04:02.894 --> 04:04.156
You should probably settle

04:04.200 --> 04:06.115
on a specific date
because when I want to go

04:06.158 --> 04:08.248
to RadioShack and my dad says,
"Maybe another time,"

04:08.291 --> 04:09.858
we never end up going.

04:09.901 --> 04:12.295
Thank you so much, Sheldon.
I think we got this.

04:12.339 --> 04:17.082
Yes. Well, uh, Sheldon, uh,
s-see you next week.

04:17.126 --> 04:20.738
Bye. Can you explain why you
didn't settle on a specific date

04:20.782 --> 04:23.175
for coffee with
Dr. Sturgis?

04:23.219 --> 04:25.874
Maybe another time.
Okay.

04:25.917 --> 04:28.833
And then she said
she didn't want the other kids

04:28.877 --> 04:30.879
to see Billy hanging out
with Sheldon.

04:30.922 --> 04:32.576
That boy's only other friend
is a chicken

04:32.620 --> 04:34.230
and she's worried about Sheldon?

04:34.274 --> 04:37.320
What do we do?
Tell Missy she can't go?

04:37.364 --> 04:38.843
If we're only gonna
let Missy go places

04:38.887 --> 04:40.062
where they want
to have Sheldon,

04:40.105 --> 04:41.542
then she ain't gonna
get out much.

04:41.585 --> 04:43.413
Well, I don't think
it's right that...

04:45.459 --> 04:47.374
Sup.

04:47.417 --> 04:51.116
Excuse me. Can't you see that
your father and I are talking?

04:51.160 --> 04:53.336
Yeah, but you can
talk anywhere,

04:53.380 --> 04:56.557
and this is the only room
in the house with a TV.

04:56.600 --> 04:58.123
Get out of here.

04:58.167 --> 05:00.517
Suit yourself.

05:00.561 --> 05:02.302
But I'd like to point out,

05:02.345 --> 05:04.304
if you'd let me buy a TV
for my bedroom,

05:04.347 --> 05:06.349
we wouldn't be in this
situation, now would we?

05:06.393 --> 05:08.830
Go.

05:08.873 --> 05:10.614
I just hate

05:10.658 --> 05:12.529
that our little boy
gets left out.

05:12.573 --> 05:15.358
Me, too, but he should
probably get used to it.

05:15.402 --> 05:17.752
That's a terrible thing to say.

05:17.795 --> 05:21.321
Oh, come on, Mary, the boy's
not exactly a social butterfly.

05:21.364 --> 05:23.758
In fact, he's scared
of butterflies.

05:23.801 --> 05:25.020
Besides,
it's their house.

05:25.063 --> 05:26.369
If they don't want him,

05:26.413 --> 05:27.979
there's nothing
you can do about it.

05:30.025 --> 05:33.594
Pastor Jeff, are you
still looking for a topic

05:33.637 --> 05:35.030
for this week's sermon?

05:35.073 --> 05:36.858
You mean the one I'm
doing in 20 minutes?

05:36.901 --> 05:39.991
Sorry, silly question.No.

05:40.035 --> 05:42.080
What do you got?
I was gonna do Noah's ark,

05:42.124 --> 05:44.300
but Sheldon's
gonna eat me alive,

05:44.344 --> 05:46.781
like those two lions would've
done to those two giraffes.

05:46.824 --> 05:50.306
Well, I've been thinking
about the importance

05:50.350 --> 05:52.352
of being neighborly.

05:54.441 --> 05:56.443
CONGREGATION:
♪ Heart of my

05:56.486 --> 05:58.401
♪ Own heart...

05:58.445 --> 06:01.361

06:01.404 --> 06:04.276

06:16.376 --> 06:17.551
Please be seated.

06:19.988 --> 06:23.121
A Pharisee once asked Jesus what

06:23.165 --> 06:25.515
the greatest commandment was,
and do you know what he said?

06:25.559 --> 06:28.170
Sheldon,
it's a rhetorical question.

06:28.213 --> 06:30.433
Aw.
He said it was

06:30.477 --> 06:34.698
to love God and love
your neighbor as yourself.

06:34.742 --> 06:37.048
And that's what I want
to talk about today,

06:37.092 --> 06:40.269
being a good neighbor.
How do we love our neighbors?

06:40.312 --> 06:42.402
We check in on them,

06:42.445 --> 06:44.447
we welcome them
into our homes.

06:44.491 --> 06:46.667
If we're having a party,
we invite them.

06:46.710 --> 06:48.538
Even if they're not
the most popular.Are you kidding me?

06:48.582 --> 06:49.931
Shh.

06:49.974 --> 06:51.889
Some of the Romans
thought he was a little weird,

06:51.933 --> 06:54.457
but if you invite him
into your heart,

06:54.501 --> 06:57.547
you get to go to
the biggest party of all,

06:57.591 --> 06:59.157
the one in the sky.

06:59.201 --> 07:01.290
Ooh, a party
in the sky.

07:01.333 --> 07:03.379
Fun.
He means heaven.

07:03.423 --> 07:05.337
Or a blimp.

07:05.381 --> 07:07.427
He means heaven.

07:07.470 --> 07:11.039
I can't believe you told
on me to Pastor Jeff.

07:11.082 --> 07:13.476
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

07:13.520 --> 07:15.260
Hi, neighbor.

07:15.304 --> 07:16.479
Hi.JEFF: No matter
how funny they look.

07:20.396 --> 07:21.615
It just don't
make no sense.

07:21.658 --> 07:23.443
If I'm gonna pay for it
with my own money,

07:23.486 --> 07:25.270
why can't I get a TV
for my bedroom?

07:25.314 --> 07:27.403
You have so much money, why
don't you save it for college?

07:27.447 --> 07:28.883
If you're not gonna
take this seriously,

07:28.926 --> 07:30.711
I don't even know why
I'm talking to you.

07:30.754 --> 07:32.713
Your mother won't let me
have a TV in my room,

07:32.756 --> 07:34.279
so you're not
getting one in yours.

07:34.323 --> 07:37.239
Why do you care what Mom says?

07:37.282 --> 07:39.502
You're the man of the house,
what you say goes.

07:39.546 --> 07:41.199
If you're not gonna
take this seriously,

07:41.243 --> 07:42.723
I don't know why
I'm talking to you.

07:46.074 --> 07:47.336
Hello?

07:47.379 --> 07:50.426
Hello, George.
Uh, John Sturgis here.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.907
Oh, hey, how you doing?Well, honestly,

07:52.950 --> 07:55.431
it's been a bit
of a confusing week,

07:55.475 --> 07:59.479
and I was hoping we could
schedule some male bonding time.

07:59.522 --> 08:03.526
Oh?Perhaps go to a bar

08:03.570 --> 08:06.442
or, uh, take a brisk walk
together.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.618
I'm not really a walker.

08:08.662 --> 08:12.404
Well, that's true.Well, bar it is.

08:12.448 --> 08:14.406
How's, uh, 2:00?

08:14.450 --> 08:19.324
Uh, today's not great for me.
Uh, maybe some other time.

08:20.674 --> 08:22.458
Oh, I understand.

08:22.502 --> 08:25.853
Uh, I won't bother you again.

08:25.896 --> 08:28.899
Well, it's not like that,
y-you know,

08:28.943 --> 08:30.684
I'm just kind of busy right now.

08:30.727 --> 08:34.209
Of course, you made that
perfectly clear.

08:34.252 --> 08:36.646
Goodbye.

08:39.344 --> 08:42.130
You just dump
somebody?
No.

08:42.173 --> 08:45.525
Dr. Sturgis wanted to hang out,

08:45.568 --> 08:46.874
and I'm busy.

08:46.917 --> 08:49.659
Yeah, busy breaking hearts.

08:57.928 --> 09:00.452
You win. Hope
you're happy.

09:02.280 --> 09:05.022
This was never
about winners and losers.

09:05.066 --> 09:07.547
Two kids means two gifts.

09:07.590 --> 09:11.115
And no Play-Doh,
he'll just eat it.

09:16.643 --> 09:19.602
Hey, Shelly,
I got something for you.

09:19.646 --> 09:20.603
What is it?

09:20.647 --> 09:22.518
An invitation
to Billy Sparks's

09:22.562 --> 09:25.216
birthday on Saturday.
Isn't that nice?

09:25.260 --> 09:26.783
Sheldon's gonna go?

09:26.827 --> 09:29.569
A child's birthday party?
No, thank you.

09:29.612 --> 09:32.572
Great.You're going to Billy's party.

09:32.615 --> 09:35.139
But I don't want to.And I don't want him to.

09:35.183 --> 09:36.924
Too bad, he's going.

09:36.967 --> 09:38.360
Then I don't want to go.

09:38.403 --> 09:41.798
Everyone's going
and everyone's gonna have fun.

09:42.973 --> 09:44.801
This is so unfair.

09:44.845 --> 09:47.151
It is. You should
run away from home.

09:48.936 --> 09:51.591
So they don't want Sheldon
at the party,

09:51.634 --> 09:53.810
and Sheldon doesn't
want to be at the party,

09:53.854 --> 09:55.943
but you're making him go
to the party.

09:55.986 --> 09:58.598
I'm sure he'll have a good
time when he gets there.

09:58.641 --> 10:01.078
And this isn't just because
you made a big fuss,

10:01.122 --> 10:03.167
and you're gonna be embarrassed
if he doesn't go?

10:03.211 --> 10:04.647
No.

10:04.691 --> 10:07.955
For a good Christian lady,
you sure do lie a lot.

10:07.998 --> 10:10.000
I just think it's important

10:10.044 --> 10:13.830
that every once in a while
Sheldon does normal kid things.

10:13.874 --> 10:15.919
You realize he's not
a normal kid?

10:15.963 --> 10:17.181
Of course I do.

10:17.225 --> 10:18.618
Then what are you doing?

10:18.661 --> 10:21.621
I'm trying to make sure
he knows how to be social

10:21.664 --> 10:25.712
so he doesn't become some lonely
adult no one wants to be around.

10:28.453 --> 10:30.325
Damn it.

10:31.718 --> 10:33.502
Oh.

10:33.545 --> 10:34.764
Hello.

10:34.808 --> 10:36.287
Hey, John.

10:36.331 --> 10:38.159
Oh, George.

10:38.202 --> 10:40.596
Uh, you just caught me
on my way out...

10:40.640 --> 10:42.642
to a party... with people.

10:42.685 --> 10:44.600
A people party.

10:44.644 --> 10:47.516
Sure. Hey, listen,
I just wanted to let you know

10:47.559 --> 10:50.693
that my schedule opened up, and
if you still want to hang out,

10:50.737 --> 10:52.869
you could come over on Saturday
and watch a game.

10:52.913 --> 10:57.439
I don't know
if Saturday works for me. Uh...

10:57.482 --> 10:59.267
Okay, well,
you just let me know.

10:59.310 --> 11:00.616
Wait!

11:00.660 --> 11:03.532
Saturday's fine. I'll be there.

11:03.575 --> 11:04.968
Okay.

11:05.012 --> 11:06.666
Have a good night.

11:06.709 --> 11:08.580
Goodbye!

11:09.625 --> 11:11.627
Sheldon's going
to that party.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.890
I'm a good liar.

11:15.979 --> 11:17.981
What'd I get him?

11:18.025 --> 11:19.200
Connect Four.

11:19.243 --> 11:21.637
That was thoughtful of me.Shelly?

11:21.681 --> 11:23.117
Come on!
It's time to go.

11:23.160 --> 11:24.727
Do I have to
wait for Sheldon?

11:24.771 --> 11:26.294
Can't I just go now?

11:26.337 --> 11:28.252
No, we're going together
as a family.

11:29.689 --> 11:30.777
Greetings, Mother.

11:30.820 --> 11:32.996
I'm ready to beam down
to the party.

11:35.042 --> 11:36.347
You go on ahead.

11:36.391 --> 11:38.436
Oh, thank you, Jesus.

11:39.481 --> 11:41.483
What do you think
you are wearing?

11:41.526 --> 11:42.832
A Mr. Spock outfit.

11:42.876 --> 11:44.704
I know it's a
Mr. Spock outfit.

11:44.747 --> 11:45.661
Then why did you ask?

11:45.705 --> 11:46.880
You can't wear that.

11:46.923 --> 11:48.490
No one else is
gonna be dressed up.

11:48.533 --> 11:49.926
That's fine.
I plan on pretending

11:49.970 --> 11:52.494
I'm a neutral observer
of an alien culture.

11:52.537 --> 11:54.931
Or you can go and play
with the other kids

11:54.975 --> 11:57.238
and wear pants from this planet.

11:57.281 --> 11:58.935
I thought you said
I was supposed to have fun.

12:00.154 --> 12:02.330
Go and change.
You are not wearing that.

12:02.373 --> 12:03.897
Then I'm not going.You're going.

12:03.940 --> 12:05.594
Then I'm wearing this.No, you're not.

12:05.637 --> 12:07.335
Yes, I am.

12:07.378 --> 12:09.903
Well, if you're gonna wear that,
you need to participate.

12:09.946 --> 12:11.121
Participate how?

12:11.165 --> 12:13.210
Party games, cake...

12:13.254 --> 12:15.430
and singing "Happy Birthday."

12:15.473 --> 12:18.041
No games, one slice of cake,

12:18.085 --> 12:20.565
and I will mouth the words
while the others sing.

12:21.610 --> 12:23.786
One game,

12:23.830 --> 12:27.703
andyou need to interact
with the other children.

12:27.747 --> 12:28.791
♪ Y'all ready?

12:28.835 --> 12:30.401
♪ Ready!

12:30.445 --> 12:31.620
♪ Do the funky chicken now

12:33.665 --> 12:34.710
♪ You flap your arms...

12:34.754 --> 12:36.146
Fascinating.

12:36.190 --> 12:38.409
It seems to be a
carbon-based life-form.

12:38.453 --> 12:40.020
♪ Then you know...

12:40.063 --> 12:41.891
I'm interacting.

12:41.935 --> 12:43.806
♪ Oh, oh.

12:50.639 --> 12:52.075
Hello!

12:52.119 --> 12:53.947
Sheldon's not home.Oh.

12:53.990 --> 12:57.298
I-I'm here to watch a sporting
event with your father.

12:57.341 --> 12:59.082
Really?Yes.

12:59.126 --> 13:03.521
He only called it "the game," so
I don't know which one it is.

13:03.565 --> 13:06.263
Well, this is just great.
Come on in.

13:06.307 --> 13:07.787
Thank you.

13:07.830 --> 13:11.660
Hey, Dad, Dr. Sturgis is here
to watch football with you.

13:11.703 --> 13:15.577
Oh, football. Good, that
was the one I read up on.

13:15.620 --> 13:17.448
Hey, John, nice to see ya.

13:17.492 --> 13:20.582
You, too. Uh, brought
some snacks for the game.

13:20.625 --> 13:21.844
How nice.

13:21.888 --> 13:23.541
Hope you like grapes.

13:23.585 --> 13:26.849
Oh, there's nothing my dad loves
more than football and grapes.

13:26.893 --> 13:30.113
Why don't you head on
in to the den, John?

13:32.376 --> 13:33.856
You, get lost.

13:33.900 --> 13:37.077
So you two can feed
each other grapes? Got it.

13:43.997 --> 13:46.826
Hmm. Gallus gallus domesticus,

13:46.869 --> 13:49.785
otherwise known
as "Earth chicken."

13:49.829 --> 13:53.484
Live long and prosper...
you filthy bird.

13:55.269 --> 13:57.053
I thought you
didn't like chickens.

13:57.097 --> 13:58.576
Sheldon doesn't
like chickens.

13:58.620 --> 14:00.665
Mr. Spock finds them
fascinating.

14:00.709 --> 14:03.668
Who's Mr. Spock?I'm Mr. Spock.

14:03.712 --> 14:05.627
I'm Billy.

14:05.670 --> 14:06.715
What you doing?

14:06.758 --> 14:08.630
Using my tricorder
to collect data.

14:08.673 --> 14:10.501
What's a tricorder?

14:10.545 --> 14:12.112
It's a multifunctional
handheld device

14:12.155 --> 14:13.896
used for scanning
and analysis.

14:13.940 --> 14:17.073
Cool. And what's everything
you just said?

14:17.117 --> 14:20.076
Fascinating.

14:23.601 --> 14:26.909
George, would you
prefer me to wait

14:26.953 --> 14:28.345
for a commercial break

14:28.389 --> 14:31.696
before I bring up
my emotional state?

14:31.740 --> 14:34.569
Oh, still want
to talk about that, huh?

14:34.612 --> 14:35.657
Well, I...

14:35.700 --> 14:38.312
do think it would be
helpful for me.

14:38.355 --> 14:42.316
Uh, we got seven minutes
till kickoff.

14:42.359 --> 14:44.796
Have at it.Where to begin?

14:44.840 --> 14:48.278
I saw Connie for the first time
since I broke up with her,

14:48.322 --> 14:51.064
and it was harder
than I expected.

14:51.107 --> 14:53.109
Well, breakups can be rough.

14:53.153 --> 14:55.633
I thought I was doing
the right thing by her,

14:55.677 --> 14:58.201
but now it seems
that I've lost her,

14:58.245 --> 15:01.944
not only as a romantic partner,
but even as a friend.

15:01.988 --> 15:04.773
Women, huh?I've been feeling

15:04.816 --> 15:08.211
the loss very profoundly
and it's making me wonder

15:08.255 --> 15:10.474
if she also is feeling lonely

15:10.518 --> 15:13.825
and I made a bad decision
for both of us.

15:16.350 --> 15:18.656
I hate to be the one
to tell you this, John,

15:18.700 --> 15:21.050
but, uh...

15:21.094 --> 15:23.444
she's kind of been
seeing someone new

15:23.487 --> 15:25.446
and, uh...

15:25.489 --> 15:27.622
she seems to be
doing okay.

15:27.665 --> 15:31.278
I see.

15:33.019 --> 15:34.455
Is she happy?

15:34.498 --> 15:37.632
Hard to tell.
Her face is all scrunched up

15:37.675 --> 15:39.939
and pinched
most of the time.

15:39.982 --> 15:43.855
Well, I hope this man she's
seeing treats her well.

15:45.031 --> 15:46.423
He seems okay.

15:46.467 --> 15:50.036
I also hope he gets lost
at sea and never returns.

15:51.341 --> 15:54.214
I'm having a lot
of feelings.

15:54.257 --> 15:56.956
Well, when that happens to me,
I have another beer.

15:56.999 --> 15:59.567
I haven't finished
this one yet.

15:59.610 --> 16:00.872
More for me.

16:02.657 --> 16:05.790
Ensign Sparks, there appears
to be a white object

16:05.834 --> 16:08.576
under this chicken.It's called an egg.

16:08.619 --> 16:11.709
Interesting. What is its
function on this planet?

16:11.753 --> 16:15.496
People eat them and throw them
at me on Halloween.

16:15.539 --> 16:17.846
What are you doing out here?

16:17.889 --> 16:19.326
Playing with Sheldon.

16:19.369 --> 16:20.849
You're missing your party.

16:20.892 --> 16:22.329
But I'm having fun.

16:22.372 --> 16:24.679
Do not be alarmed,
our mission is one of peace.

16:24.722 --> 16:28.074
I'm gonna go have a little chat
with your mother.

16:29.640 --> 16:31.773
Seems unlikely;
my mother's on Vulcan.

16:31.816 --> 16:33.818
My mom is on Valium.

16:47.702 --> 16:50.270
Oh, they scored
another touchdown.

16:50.313 --> 16:52.446
That's just
a replay, John.

16:55.927 --> 16:58.974
Hey.Connie.

16:59.018 --> 17:01.716
I saw your bike outside,
so I-I thought I'd just,

17:01.759 --> 17:04.675
uh, say hi.

17:04.719 --> 17:06.460
Well, that's so nice of you.

17:06.503 --> 17:08.549
I don't mean to interrupt
or anything.

17:08.592 --> 17:12.248
I just wanted to... check in.

17:13.684 --> 17:15.991
Would it be awkward
if I asked her to join us?

17:16.035 --> 17:18.733
Oh, couldn't be
any more awkward.

17:18.776 --> 17:21.388
Would you like to, uh,
watch the game with us?

17:21.431 --> 17:22.824
It's-it's football.

17:22.867 --> 17:25.348
Well, sure.

17:25.392 --> 17:26.784
I guess a...

17:26.828 --> 17:28.830
little visit wouldn't hurt.

17:30.136 --> 17:32.225
Excellent.

17:32.268 --> 17:35.489
Let me guess,
you brought the grapes.

17:35.532 --> 17:37.665
I did.

17:43.236 --> 17:44.759
Hey, how many of those
have you had?

17:44.802 --> 17:46.674
So many!

17:49.198 --> 17:50.939
Hope you're happy.

17:50.982 --> 17:53.724
Billy's missing his own party
'cause he's playing spaceman

17:53.768 --> 17:55.813
in the chicken coop
with your son.

17:58.251 --> 18:01.123
You were right. I shouldn't have
made you invite him.

18:01.167 --> 18:02.385
I'm sorry.

18:05.084 --> 18:07.216
Okay.

18:07.260 --> 18:09.566
Well, good.

18:09.610 --> 18:13.266
It's just hard
to see him be left out.

18:13.309 --> 18:16.965
And I worry it's not gonna
get better when he grows older.

18:19.185 --> 18:22.275
Can't say that Billy
is exactly Mr. Popular either.

18:24.320 --> 18:26.279
I'm sure this kind of stuff
bothers me

18:26.322 --> 18:28.107
way more than
it bothers Sheldon.

18:31.501 --> 18:33.503
Doesn't make it any easier,
does it?

18:33.547 --> 18:35.897
No.

18:35.940 --> 18:37.986
I'm gonna take Shelly back home

18:38.029 --> 18:41.598
so that Billy can
get back to his party.
Eh.

18:41.642 --> 18:44.297
You know, they're
having fun out there.

18:45.863 --> 18:48.257
SHELDON:
Gallus gallus domesticus
pooped on my uniform!

18:48.301 --> 18:50.912
The mission
is compromised!

18:51.956 --> 18:54.133
Maybe take him home.Yeah.

18:59.399 --> 19:02.228
I've got something here for
both of you. It's from Billy.

19:02.271 --> 19:04.186
I hope it's not
another invitation.

19:04.230 --> 19:06.797
It's probably a thank you note.

19:06.841 --> 19:08.669
So now I have to write
a you're welcome note?

19:08.712 --> 19:10.236
You people are killing me.

19:10.279 --> 19:11.541
"Dear Sheldon
and Missy,

19:11.585 --> 19:13.195
"thank you for coming
to my party.

19:13.239 --> 19:15.023
"I liked playing with Mr. Spock

19:15.066 --> 19:17.286
and watching Missy throw up
Kool-Aid in the bushes."

19:17.330 --> 19:19.245
Still tasted like cherry.

19:19.288 --> 19:22.944
"My mother also threw up,
but that was because of wine.

19:22.987 --> 19:25.512
My dad says she
drinks because..."Okay, that's nice.

19:25.555 --> 19:27.992
But there's more.No, there's not.

19:28.036 --> 19:30.952
Guess we'll never know
why she drinks.
