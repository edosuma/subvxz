00:01.235 --> 00:03.301
- Tuesday's defence team has
found out the identity

00:03.337 --> 00:06.705
Of our primary confidential
informant jake mardy.

00:06.840 --> 00:08.606
- How'd they find out
he's our ci?

00:08.642 --> 00:10.776
The smartest thing to do
is for you to testify

00:10.845 --> 00:12.644
For the crown, that way
we can protect you.

00:12.713 --> 00:15.247
- What about my girlfriend?
What about yolanda?

00:15.316 --> 00:17.115
- Maybe she can come
with you, okay?

00:18.219 --> 00:19.584
<i> (jake): You used to not be</i>
<i> such a dork.</i>

00:19.653 --> 00:22.988
You knew how to have fun.
- Fine. I'm here to party.

00:23.057 --> 00:25.891
I'm not feeling so good.
- It's probably the purple rain

00:26.026 --> 00:27.859
I slipped into
your drink a while ago.

00:27.895 --> 00:29.128
It's gonna be a trip.

00:29.130 --> 00:30.962
- Adeline french? You found her?

00:31.032 --> 00:34.533
- We found this on security
footage at an outdoor patio

00:34.668 --> 00:36.601
At gemini beach club
in the virgin islands.

00:36.637 --> 00:38.971
- Goby and the shrimp,
they bond as juveniles

00:39.106 --> 00:41.139
And then they stay together
their entire lives.

00:41.208 --> 00:42.541
Just like me and jenn.

00:42.543 --> 00:44.309
<i> (sam): I wasn't that careful</i>
<i> around ro.</i>

00:44.311 --> 00:46.678
<i> (kelly): Let her find out</i>
<i> a few things that can</i>
<i> lead her down a path.</i>

00:46.714 --> 00:48.413
<i> - Set up a trap?</i>
<i> - Why not?</i>

00:49.216 --> 00:51.249
(all): Surprise!

00:51.952 --> 00:54.219
- Congratulations, honey!

00:54.221 --> 00:56.888
You don't have a hug
for your old mama?

00:58.993 --> 01:00.058
- Wow...

01:07.735 --> 01:10.169
Uh, wazowski.
- Hey.

01:11.505 --> 01:12.571
- How'd you sleep?

01:12.573 --> 01:15.240
- Oh, I slept like
absolute hell.

01:15.375 --> 01:17.576
I just kept thinking about ro,
you know?

01:17.645 --> 01:20.979
And jenn, just on my computer
looking at our files.

01:21.048 --> 01:23.781
How are you?
(sighs)

01:23.818 --> 01:26.852
- Honestly? I came to work
early to avoid my mom.

01:26.854 --> 01:28.587
(chuckling)
she's trying to help me

01:28.722 --> 01:30.322
Plan my wedding.
(scoffs)

01:30.324 --> 01:32.791
I mean, where were you
when I needed someone to help

01:32.926 --> 01:34.259
Plan my high school
graduation, mom?

01:34.261 --> 01:35.894
Thanks, no thanks.

01:35.963 --> 01:38.063
Anyway, I can't think
about her right now,

01:38.065 --> 01:39.998
We have bigger fish to fry.
- Exactly.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.134
We set a play, now we just gotta
follow through.

01:42.136 --> 01:42.934
- Yes.

01:43.838 --> 01:45.337
- Detective duff.
- I'm here too.

01:45.406 --> 01:46.872
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:46.941 --> 01:48.740
- Your presence is required
in the boardroom.

01:48.809 --> 01:49.841
- What?

01:50.644 --> 01:51.877
Don't worry, I'm coming too.

01:53.413 --> 01:55.280
(indistinct chatter)

01:56.817 --> 01:58.951
- Surprise!
(chuckling)

01:58.953 --> 02:01.019
- Mom?
- Meet your wedding planner!

02:01.088 --> 02:03.956
- Mrs. Kelly duff-greene!

02:04.091 --> 02:07.025
(laughing)
oh my god, you are fierce,

02:07.094 --> 02:09.494
I can feel the energy
in those delts.

02:09.497 --> 02:11.029
- Okay, who are you?
- He's my brother.

02:11.165 --> 02:13.565
I met your mom outside
of your loft last night

02:13.634 --> 02:15.067
And told her about houston.

02:15.202 --> 02:17.069
He's the best wedding planner
in the gta.

02:17.071 --> 02:20.639
- Gta? Bitch, best wedding
planner in the o-n-t!

02:20.708 --> 02:24.576
Maybe the whole entire c-a-n.
5 stars, 5 stars, 5 stars.

02:24.711 --> 02:26.578
- Look, look, we already got
the ball rolling,

02:26.713 --> 02:28.514
We just need a few minutes
of your time...

02:28.649 --> 02:29.815
- Are you serious?

02:29.817 --> 02:31.917
- ...To choose
your favourite options!

02:31.986 --> 02:34.086
- Ma! I don't need
a wedding planner.

02:34.221 --> 02:35.687
- I know you don't
like planning,

02:35.822 --> 02:37.322
But there is a lot
to figure out!

02:37.324 --> 02:40.124
- Not right now! Especially
at my place of work!

02:40.161 --> 02:42.293
Listen, uh, houston, is it?

02:42.329 --> 02:45.730
Uh, look, I really do appreciate
your job,

02:45.766 --> 02:47.666
And really, your enthusiasm.

02:47.668 --> 02:50.469
But--
- butts... Are for slapping.

02:50.471 --> 02:52.271
Don't make me do it.
- What?

02:52.273 --> 02:53.672
- Guest list, dinner list,
dj, flowers!

02:53.807 --> 02:56.908
- You have got to be kidding me!
Stop it! Mom!

02:56.911 --> 02:59.177
- He's hilarious!
(laughing)

02:59.213 --> 03:00.545
Could you imagine growing up
with this guy?

03:00.614 --> 03:01.746
We had so much fun.

03:01.782 --> 03:03.949
- Just pick one of these.
It's on me.

03:04.018 --> 03:06.317
Contemporary tower or...

03:07.488 --> 03:08.687
Beautiful blooms?

03:08.689 --> 03:11.490
- No, no, no, mom, I just want
to marry nathan, okay?

03:11.625 --> 03:13.292
We don't need a cake,
I don't even like cake.

03:13.427 --> 03:15.694
- Your mom is paying
for the cake, alright?

03:15.763 --> 03:17.629
You just have to pick one!

03:17.698 --> 03:19.131
- Okay! Beautiful blooms.

03:19.266 --> 03:20.999
Organic and casual
just like the bride.

03:21.068 --> 03:24.902
- And, while you're at it,
invitations!

03:24.939 --> 03:27.439
- Copperplate for the caps,
fragment core for the content.

03:27.441 --> 03:29.107
No curves, no cursives,
emails only,

03:29.243 --> 03:30.575
No one is reading print anymore.

03:30.578 --> 03:32.944
- Christ on a cracker,
you are hired!

03:32.980 --> 03:34.646
- See what I'm saying, mom?
We got this.

03:34.648 --> 03:39.017
Look, I do appreciate
the gesture, but...

03:39.086 --> 03:43.321
If you touch me again,
I'm gonna put your butt in jail.

03:43.357 --> 03:45.223
(upbeat music)

03:50.664 --> 03:54.266
Jenn... Diamante.

03:54.401 --> 03:56.167
What do we have here?

03:57.504 --> 04:00.605
Okay, no records, no arrests,
a few traffic violations.

04:00.608 --> 04:02.374
Okay, let's see...

04:03.677 --> 04:06.411
Let's dig into that juvie file.
Possession, assault...

04:06.546 --> 04:08.780
I'll get the files sent over
from 82 division.

04:08.782 --> 04:11.883
- Going through her financials,
uh, she was overextended

04:11.919 --> 04:14.219
Two years ago,
but she's doing okay now.

04:15.422 --> 04:17.021
Oh, wait, this is interesting.

04:17.891 --> 04:19.424
- What? Tell me.
- Okay, she made

04:19.426 --> 04:21.893
Four large payments
to a numbered account.

04:21.895 --> 04:23.895
- Uh, could be a supplier,
another partner.

04:23.964 --> 04:26.864
Could be paying herself,
hiding her drug money.

04:27.434 --> 04:29.234
Okay...

04:29.236 --> 04:31.036
Guess who else
has a youth record?

04:31.038 --> 04:32.804
- Who?
- Ro wells.

04:32.939 --> 04:34.238
- What?

04:34.275 --> 04:35.707
- Kelly!

04:35.842 --> 04:37.809
(rhythmic music)
- what is go--

04:38.445 --> 04:39.444
(singing softly)

04:39.579 --> 04:41.045
What is...

04:41.081 --> 04:42.747
You're in a good mood.

04:43.517 --> 04:45.317
- I am. I'm engaged to you.

04:46.520 --> 04:47.652
I wondered where you were
this morning, though.

04:47.655 --> 04:49.520
What, early bird
catching the worm?

04:49.556 --> 04:51.923
- Well, babe, we have
a bit of a worm.

04:53.894 --> 04:54.860
(music stops)

04:54.995 --> 04:56.060
- Okay...

04:56.096 --> 04:57.929
You want to fill me in
or should we wait for naz?

04:57.998 --> 05:00.098
- Why don't we wait for naz,
he's probably gonna
call me soon,

05:00.134 --> 05:01.899
I think he's gonna call, he--
- sam.

05:05.406 --> 05:06.538
- Okay, you know what?

05:06.607 --> 05:08.406
Let's bring this worm
to observation.

05:08.475 --> 05:09.541
It's quieter there.

05:09.543 --> 05:12.410
- Uh, meet you there in five.

05:12.546 --> 05:14.112
- After you change
that outfit.

05:15.482 --> 05:18.950
- Okay. So this lawyer friend,
ro, went into your work files,

05:18.952 --> 05:22.087
Got the name of our confidential
informant in order to what?

05:22.089 --> 05:24.623
- Protect her childhood friend,
jenn diamante.

05:24.758 --> 05:27.759
- Who may be the real mastermind
behind the purple rain empire.

05:30.631 --> 05:32.764
Thing is, we don't
have much on jenn yet,

05:32.833 --> 05:34.166
Just circumstantial stuff.

05:34.301 --> 05:36.335
So we set a trap
with a dummy file.

05:36.470 --> 05:39.704
Now, the file says
that while jake mardy may
have refused to testify,

05:39.773 --> 05:42.106
We have a second informant
who's willing to cooperate

05:42.142 --> 05:44.909
In the purple rain case
and testify for the crown.

05:45.913 --> 05:47.312
- We don't have
a second informant.

05:47.314 --> 05:48.847
- Correct!

05:48.916 --> 05:50.649
- So how is this setting a trap?

05:50.784 --> 05:51.816
- Okay...

05:53.620 --> 05:56.855
- We suggested an imaginary
informant, ci-1191,

05:56.857 --> 05:58.390
Who's being transported
to a safe house

05:58.459 --> 05:59.991
At 171 locke crescent.

06:00.027 --> 06:02.026
Now, if we catch jenn
casing the joint,

06:02.096 --> 06:04.029
We'll know specifically
she was trying to infiltrate

06:04.031 --> 06:05.497
Our investigation
for her own benefit,

06:05.499 --> 06:06.931
And then we're gonna have enough
evidence to what?

06:06.967 --> 06:08.766
Oh, I don't know,
take it upstairs.

06:08.802 --> 06:10.402
- So we're putting on a play?

06:10.404 --> 06:12.370
- Yes, sir.
- I'm down with that.

06:13.740 --> 06:14.873
(suspenseful music)

06:44.905 --> 06:46.370
- Stay low until it's clear!

06:46.407 --> 06:48.406
(groaning)

06:48.442 --> 06:50.108
Stay low!
- Ow!

06:53.280 --> 06:54.579
- What are you doing?
- We're clear.

06:56.517 --> 06:57.582
- Whoa.

06:58.518 --> 06:59.851
Oh, hold up.

06:59.887 --> 07:02.187
I think this is the new me.

07:02.322 --> 07:03.454
- Are you done?

07:03.490 --> 07:05.123
- Huh? Oh.
- Yeah. Okay.

07:05.125 --> 07:07.526
We are going to be outside
watching if anyone wants

07:07.661 --> 07:09.461
To pay our ci a visit,
so stay safe and stay alert.

07:09.596 --> 07:11.029
But if they do,
we're going to...

07:11.031 --> 07:12.797
- Uh... Ugh.

07:12.866 --> 07:14.298
- Never mind. The...?

07:15.903 --> 07:17.969
You're gonna go inside
the safe room. And then,
you're gonna what?

07:18.104 --> 07:19.871
You're gonna wait
for instruction, okay?

07:19.873 --> 07:22.940
Safe room. Call us. Wait for...

07:22.976 --> 07:25.010
- Look, don't worry.
- I'm a bit worried.

07:25.145 --> 07:27.645
- Oh, you don't have to worry.
I'm gonna guard him
with my life.

07:27.647 --> 07:29.213
I've never lost
an informant yet.

07:29.249 --> 07:31.148
- Hey, you realize he's not
a real informant, right?

07:31.185 --> 07:34.419
Take your glasses off.
This is watts. He works at oce.

07:35.121 --> 07:36.188
- Oh, I get ya.

07:37.324 --> 07:40.025
- It's cool. We're good.
I brought supplies.

07:40.994 --> 07:42.894
- No way.
You brought everything?

07:42.930 --> 07:45.130
- You never know, brother.
You never know.

07:45.265 --> 07:46.865
(chuckling)
- okay.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.199
- We're out of here.

07:53.407 --> 07:56.408
- Okay, lads, we've got
the day to ourselves

07:56.410 --> 07:58.709
So you know what that means.
- Yeah.

07:58.745 --> 08:00.344
(laughing)
- yeah.

08:01.248 --> 08:03.314
Finding adeline french.

08:03.350 --> 08:04.249
(chuckling)

08:04.318 --> 08:06.284
- Oh.
- That's...

08:07.588 --> 08:09.154
- I think the red hoodie
business was very convincing

08:09.289 --> 08:11.990
And I bet anybody watching
would have ate it up.

08:11.992 --> 08:14.592
Ugh, geez, just the smell
of the greasepaint,

08:14.661 --> 08:17.028
The roar of the crowd.
- What are you on about?

08:17.163 --> 08:18.863
- Oh, sorry, I just...

08:18.866 --> 08:20.498
I was really thinking
about my old days

08:20.567 --> 08:23.435
At york collegiate
improv troupe. You know
what we're gonna do?

08:23.437 --> 08:26.137
We're gonna do a little bit...
We're gonna do a little bit
of it. Are you ready?

08:26.173 --> 08:27.538
Okay, here we go.
You're gonna love this.

08:27.574 --> 08:29.741
(sighs)
scene. Hello. How are you?

08:29.743 --> 08:31.409
I would like to return
this shirt

08:31.478 --> 08:33.144
For a full refund, please.

08:33.213 --> 08:34.679
Then you say...
- Oh... Okay.

08:34.681 --> 08:36.348
- Well, you just can't say
"okay", it's like, "yes, and..."

08:36.483 --> 08:38.283
Like, you gotta add to it,
you just can't say one word,

08:38.418 --> 08:39.951
Just do what I say, just try,
it'll be fun.

08:40.086 --> 08:42.754
Come on. Okay, ready?
And I'm gonna give you
a second chance. Here we go.

08:42.756 --> 08:44.289
And... Scene.

08:44.424 --> 08:46.223
Oh, hello, sally.
I can tell that 'cause

08:46.260 --> 08:48.359
I can read your name tag
on your shirt.

08:48.395 --> 08:51.563
I would like to return this
shirt for a full refund, please.

08:51.698 --> 08:54.232
- Yes, and you can't return
the shirt because we have

08:54.367 --> 08:55.933
A 30-day return policy.
- 30-day return policy?

08:55.969 --> 08:57.902
Oh, no, because
I will be dead from

08:57.905 --> 08:59.237
The flesh-eating disease
by then, my dear.

08:59.306 --> 09:00.838
- Then you don't need
the shirt, okay?

09:00.840 --> 09:02.974
- Oh my god, you suck at this.
That's not what's
supposed to happen

09:03.010 --> 09:04.976
'cause you're ending the improv,
you keep adding to it--

09:05.045 --> 09:06.911
- How about we deal
with this right now?

09:06.914 --> 09:07.913
- What? Oh yeah.

09:08.048 --> 09:09.914
- Do you think jenn
will actually show up?

09:09.983 --> 09:10.982
- God, I hope so.

09:12.018 --> 09:15.720
- Let me call naz again,
loop him in.

09:15.722 --> 09:18.923
Maybe jake mentioned something
about jenn to him.

09:18.926 --> 09:21.025
(phone vibrating)

09:27.935 --> 09:30.301
(groaning)

09:41.348 --> 09:43.014
(groaning)

09:43.149 --> 09:44.382
- That's a bad one.

09:45.552 --> 09:47.652
(breathing heavily)

09:51.892 --> 09:53.090
(groaning)

10:06.039 --> 10:07.238
Oh, man...

10:07.240 --> 10:09.206
(breathing heavily)

10:11.411 --> 10:14.512
Jake. What happened last night?
Did you get a nose-bleed?

10:14.648 --> 10:16.381
Hoovering up too much
purple rain?

10:18.084 --> 10:19.050
Jake?

10:19.686 --> 10:20.985
Jake!

10:21.955 --> 10:23.054
Ugh!

10:25.459 --> 10:27.125
Ah, jake! What the...

10:27.194 --> 10:28.793
Jake?! Wake up!

10:28.795 --> 10:29.927
Wake up!

10:29.963 --> 10:31.863
Hey! Wake up!

10:31.998 --> 10:33.264
Wake up!

10:33.266 --> 10:35.600
(gasps)
oh...

10:36.403 --> 10:38.403
(crying)

10:40.507 --> 10:43.507
Oh no... Jake...

10:46.513 --> 10:48.146
(breathing heavily)

10:57.858 --> 10:59.223
- I gave you too much...

10:59.292 --> 11:00.825
(gasps)

11:00.861 --> 11:02.960
I gotta get this for posterity.

11:02.996 --> 11:04.095
(jake chuckling)

11:05.298 --> 11:10.635
Hi, nazeer! Off his head
on purple rain.

11:10.637 --> 11:12.503
- Stop. Stop!

11:12.539 --> 11:14.105
Don't! Don't!

11:15.042 --> 11:17.642
(breathing heavily)

11:26.687 --> 11:30.655
Hey, nathan, it's... It's me,
uh, yeah, it's urgent.

11:30.790 --> 11:34.391
Just... Call me back. Please.

11:40.033 --> 11:42.734
- Uh, hey, kell, are you still
planning on getting married
in a few weeks?

11:42.736 --> 11:44.536
- Of course. Why?

11:44.538 --> 11:46.538
- It's that some people,
and I'm not those people,

11:46.673 --> 11:48.139
Say that it's right
around the corner,

11:48.175 --> 11:50.208
So I'm just wondering
why you think you don't need
a wedding planner.

11:50.343 --> 11:51.609
- What's to plan?
I'm gonna marry nathan.

11:51.678 --> 11:54.245
- Yes. And...
- And I don't want to deal

11:54.314 --> 11:56.213
With all the checklists and
details, there's way too much.

11:56.249 --> 11:59.217
- Okay, because...
- Because, they make me

11:59.352 --> 12:01.819
Feel overwhelmed. Oh my god,
did you just improv me?

12:01.855 --> 12:04.823
- Kell, look at me. This is not
about nathan, right? Is it?

12:04.958 --> 12:08.626
- No, no, it's not about nathan,
it's about all the details

12:08.662 --> 12:10.895
And people and all the lists

12:10.897 --> 12:12.497
And there's just
too many choices.

12:12.499 --> 12:15.200
Honestly... Honestly,
you know what I want?

12:15.202 --> 12:17.102
I just want to... I want to...

12:17.237 --> 12:20.104
I want an improv wedding. Yes.

12:20.874 --> 12:22.106
Like, "will you marry me?"

12:22.175 --> 12:25.043
Yes, and, um let's
do it without a cake.

12:25.178 --> 12:28.980
Yes, and I'mma buy that fly,
amazing dress that I saw

12:29.115 --> 12:30.781
At holt's the other day
in the window.

12:30.817 --> 12:33.717
Yes, and we don't need to spend
our hard-earned money

12:33.754 --> 12:36.654
At some stupid venue, no,
let's just have it at a park

12:36.790 --> 12:39.657
Or in a backyard
and have a fly playlist

12:39.693 --> 12:43.661
And burgers and say I dos
and then got on a plane,
off to some beach somewhere.

12:43.730 --> 12:47.298
- That sounds amazing,
but did you think that you could
just improv all of that?

12:47.334 --> 12:48.633
- Absolutely.
(phone vibrating)

12:48.768 --> 12:50.201
- Oh my god, this is naz.

12:50.270 --> 12:52.403
Hi. It's sam. I mean, you know
that 'cause you called my phone.

12:52.472 --> 12:54.005
Listen, can we just forget
about yesterday?

12:55.341 --> 12:57.541
Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa,
slow down, slow down, slow down.

12:58.845 --> 13:01.145
Oh my god, okay, naz,
just take a breath.

13:01.148 --> 13:03.214
I'm gonna get right to you,
I'm gonna bring kell,

13:03.250 --> 13:05.416
I'm gonna bring nathan
'cause you're gonna need a team.

13:05.452 --> 13:07.218
Yup. It's gonna be okay.

13:07.254 --> 13:09.220
It's gonna be okay.
We'll be right there.

13:10.924 --> 13:12.957
Naz is with jake mardy.
- Okay.

13:13.593 --> 13:14.793
- Jake mardy's dead.

13:17.764 --> 13:19.631
(suspenseful music)

13:19.766 --> 13:20.765
(clears throat)

13:34.981 --> 13:37.515
- Hey, hey!
- Sam, sam! Don't touch him.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.117
He's evidence.

13:39.252 --> 13:39.984
I...

13:41.454 --> 13:42.387
Okay.

13:42.522 --> 13:44.588
Naz. Buddy.

13:45.491 --> 13:46.791
Did you clear the house?

13:48.395 --> 13:49.460
- Yeah.

13:49.462 --> 13:52.463
- Don't touch anything.
Don't move anything.

13:52.465 --> 13:54.265
I'm gonna call this in
to ballard.

13:55.068 --> 13:56.000
- Naz...

13:57.604 --> 13:58.736
What happened?

13:58.805 --> 14:01.739
- I woke up.
I went to the bathroom,

14:01.741 --> 14:03.408
I tried washing this off,

14:03.543 --> 14:05.476
He must have done it
after I passed out.

14:05.478 --> 14:06.878
- Did you "pass out" pass out?

14:07.680 --> 14:09.681
- Yes. He, uh...

14:10.950 --> 14:13.150
He slipped purple rain
into my beer.

14:13.186 --> 14:14.518
I was in and out.

14:15.088 --> 14:16.421
I came out and...

14:17.757 --> 14:19.223
He was just lying there.

14:19.292 --> 14:20.591
I tried to help.

14:22.195 --> 14:23.228
But, uh...

14:24.497 --> 14:25.296
- Okay.

14:28.768 --> 14:30.734
Dsi team is en route.

14:32.105 --> 14:34.372
You and me need to have a talk
before we're sequestered.

14:36.343 --> 14:37.308
In there.

14:38.311 --> 14:40.711
Look around, take pictures.

14:44.985 --> 14:46.584
(sighs)

14:48.855 --> 14:50.655
- How long do you think
he's been dead?

14:51.457 --> 14:52.589
- Um...

14:56.096 --> 14:58.362
I mean, I'm no pathologist,
but I'm thinking...

14:59.432 --> 15:01.098
I don't know, five, six hours?

15:01.735 --> 15:03.401
(sighs)
- yeah.

15:04.604 --> 15:06.170
(sighs)

15:14.814 --> 15:15.913
(shutter clicks)

15:15.949 --> 15:18.516
(crying)

15:18.518 --> 15:19.616
- Hey.

15:21.721 --> 15:23.955
Badge? Cuffs? Gun?

15:24.824 --> 15:26.056
- All in the car.

15:26.726 --> 15:28.159
I came as a friend.

15:28.228 --> 15:31.829
- If there's anything I need
to know, you gotta tell me now.

15:32.866 --> 15:34.699
- I... I don't remember
what happened.

15:34.701 --> 15:36.367
- How'd you know where he was?

15:36.403 --> 15:39.203
- From the video.
I recognized the wallpaper.

15:40.072 --> 15:41.372
It's his grandma's old house.

15:42.142 --> 15:43.441
I came to see him around...

15:44.577 --> 15:47.778
...3 pm. I brought beer,
I wanted to find out

15:47.847 --> 15:50.047
Who put him up to taking
the fall in the video.

15:50.083 --> 15:52.416
He didn't want to talk
about anything serious.

15:53.186 --> 15:57.521
So we drank, played caps.

15:59.225 --> 16:01.192
That's when I started
to feel a little weird.

16:02.729 --> 16:05.596
And he said that he slipped
purple rain into my drink.

16:06.433 --> 16:09.266
He was laughing his ass off,

16:09.302 --> 16:12.603
Talking about, um,
panama, ecuador,

16:12.672 --> 16:13.871
He was gonna make a fresh start.

16:13.940 --> 16:15.940
- Did he talk about
meeting anyone?

16:16.009 --> 16:18.909
Anybody come or go?
- I don't know...

16:20.146 --> 16:23.214
Last I remember,
it was probably 9.

16:26.019 --> 16:27.418
- Did you all argue?

16:28.555 --> 16:29.486
Have a fight?

16:29.522 --> 16:30.554
- Yes...

16:31.358 --> 16:32.656
I think.

16:33.626 --> 16:34.559
(sighing)

16:34.694 --> 16:36.293
What if it was me?

16:37.330 --> 16:39.764
Nathan, I couldn't say
it wasn't.

16:39.833 --> 16:41.699
I can't--
- no, no, no.

16:41.701 --> 16:44.768
You do not incriminate yourself,
you hear me?

16:46.873 --> 16:49.841
Whatever you did
or didn't do...

16:51.344 --> 16:53.010
...We got your back.

16:54.881 --> 16:56.114
(shutter clicking)

16:56.249 --> 16:58.148
(sighs)
- no forced entry.

16:59.319 --> 17:02.186
Means jake probably knew
the person and let him in.

17:03.389 --> 17:05.255
Any thoughts on this knife?

17:05.291 --> 17:08.392
- Yeah. I think it matches
the ones in there.

17:10.864 --> 17:11.963
(sighs)

17:11.965 --> 17:13.798
(car approaching)

17:14.667 --> 17:16.868
- Wow. That was fast.

17:17.003 --> 17:17.969
(car door closing)

17:18.104 --> 17:19.169
Guys!

17:19.873 --> 17:21.539
I think they're here.

17:41.361 --> 17:42.893
- Well, well, well.

17:44.064 --> 17:46.898
How many cops does it take
to change a lightbulb?

17:50.703 --> 17:52.236
That was rhetorical,
but I think you get my point.

17:52.371 --> 17:56.441
Hannah cook, dsi.
I'm gonna assume you're
the officer involved.

17:57.777 --> 17:59.643
(suspenseful music)

18:11.224 --> 18:15.792
First class... What are you
up to now, you saucy minx?

18:17.397 --> 18:19.062
(phone ringing)

18:19.866 --> 18:21.332
(grunting)

18:21.334 --> 18:22.799
Go for swallows.

18:22.836 --> 18:24.535
- Left foot green.
- Okay.

18:24.670 --> 18:25.969
- There's no way...

18:27.273 --> 18:29.006
- Just try.
- Yeah.

18:29.008 --> 18:30.341
- Just try.

18:31.711 --> 18:33.678
- Absolutely, yeah.

18:33.813 --> 18:35.612
We've got those covered here.

18:35.648 --> 18:37.281
No sign of visitors yet.

18:37.416 --> 18:39.316
Don't worry, wazowski.

18:39.352 --> 18:41.685
You do your thing.
We'll get back to you.

18:41.754 --> 18:43.287
Ding you later, okay?

18:44.357 --> 18:46.423
(clears throat)
- t, give us a spin.

18:48.495 --> 18:49.694
Please?

18:50.396 --> 18:51.629
(sighing)
- okay...

18:51.698 --> 18:52.697
- Or join us.

18:53.566 --> 18:55.499
(grunting)

18:56.302 --> 18:58.035
- Right hand, red.
- What?!

18:58.171 --> 19:00.637
- Here we go. Here we go.
- You can do it. Here we go.

19:00.673 --> 19:03.107
- One, two, three.
(laughing)

19:03.109 --> 19:04.976
(sam): What do you think
is going to happen to naz?

19:05.111 --> 19:07.645
(kelly): Naz will be fine.
Jake had a target on his back

19:07.647 --> 19:08.779
The moment he put out
that video.

19:08.915 --> 19:10.347
Dsi will figure that out.

19:12.986 --> 19:15.052
In the meantime,
let's figure out who actually

19:15.188 --> 19:16.787
Did kill jake mardy.

19:20.260 --> 19:22.993
(doorbell rings)
(woman): Hang on, hang on!

19:23.029 --> 19:25.663
It's fine, I'm expecting
a sunbed for the backyard.

19:27.200 --> 19:29.132
Hi.
- Hey.

19:30.336 --> 19:32.135
- What's going on?
- Look, it was so great for you

19:32.172 --> 19:33.537
To come out last night.
Really appreciate it.

19:33.606 --> 19:36.206
I think you left
your jacket, though,
and we were driving around,

19:36.242 --> 19:38.209
Figured we'd just drop it off.

19:38.278 --> 19:40.110
- That's not mine.
- No? Are you sure?

19:41.181 --> 19:42.346
I thought I saw you
wearing this last night.

19:42.382 --> 19:45.082
- Oh, I'm sorry you went
to all the trouble.

19:45.118 --> 19:46.617
- Jenn, what the hell?!

19:46.752 --> 19:47.952
We're in the middle
of something!

19:48.021 --> 19:50.320
- Oh my gosh, is that ro?
What? What's she doing here?

19:51.691 --> 19:53.491
- My god.
(laughing)

19:53.493 --> 19:54.625
Women of the hour.

19:54.760 --> 19:56.827
Scotch and soda,
ginny and tonic.

19:56.963 --> 19:58.362
You two...
(laughing)

19:58.398 --> 20:00.097
- Uh, I thought that you
were working today?

20:00.133 --> 20:02.099
- I am, I'm just
doing it remotely.

20:02.101 --> 20:04.167
What are you guys doing here?
- Just returning jackets.

20:04.204 --> 20:07.504
- Oh.
- It wasn't mine, but still...

20:07.540 --> 20:08.972
Very thoughtful.

20:10.176 --> 20:11.909
- So, you guys took off
into the night last night

20:11.978 --> 20:13.577
And I didn't know if I'd hear
from you again.

20:13.646 --> 20:15.646
(laughing)
- I didn't think so either.

20:15.648 --> 20:17.315
I got jenn home at 11:30,

20:17.450 --> 20:20.384
Tried to get her to bed,
but then ding-dong here

20:20.386 --> 20:22.987
Gets a second wind.
- Oh, what does that look like?

20:22.989 --> 20:25.856
- Remington's, baby.
- The strip club?

20:25.858 --> 20:27.725
- Yeah.
- And I made a fatal mistake

20:27.727 --> 20:30.728
Last night, I told my old friend
ro here that I haven't had

20:30.730 --> 20:32.963
Any action in the past
eight months,

20:32.999 --> 20:37.234
By choice, I might add.
- Which is unhygienic, frankly.

20:37.270 --> 20:40.538
She needed to get
her groove back and if you are
looking for groove...

20:41.541 --> 20:43.573
Valentino's your man.

20:45.078 --> 20:47.344
- Ow! Bow chicka bow bow.

20:47.380 --> 20:50.481
- I stayed till 4 am, insanity!

20:50.616 --> 20:52.683
I blame you,
you criminal reprobate.

20:52.818 --> 20:55.486
- Ah, you loved it.
- Criminal reprobate!

20:55.555 --> 20:57.287
(laughing)
- he looks like a nice man.

20:59.759 --> 21:02.126
- So valentino was working here
last night?

21:03.129 --> 21:04.261
What about the photos
I sent you?

21:04.297 --> 21:05.896
Did you happen to see either one
of those women

21:06.032 --> 21:07.864
There at your establishment
last night?

21:08.701 --> 21:10.501
(sighs)
okay, yeah. Thanks.

21:10.570 --> 21:11.702
Appreciate it.

21:12.838 --> 21:14.838
Manager recognized both jenn
and ro's photos,

21:14.907 --> 21:17.441
Said they were there till
around 3:30 am.

21:17.443 --> 21:20.444
Loud, proud, lots of laps,
lots of dances. Ugh.

21:20.513 --> 21:23.381
- I don't know, maybe she got
someone else to kill jake?

21:23.516 --> 21:25.449
Maybe they got krish
out of jail?

21:25.451 --> 21:28.452
Maybe he did it.
- Or Tuesday, for that matter.

21:28.587 --> 21:30.921
- Alright. I appreciate it.

21:32.792 --> 21:35.926
Oh, my buddy in dsi says
hannah cook's a shark.

21:35.962 --> 21:38.796
No loyalty to police,
she comes from the attorney
general's office.

21:38.931 --> 21:40.731
- Wait, she never worked
homicide?

21:40.866 --> 21:42.265
- She's not a cop.

21:42.302 --> 21:44.968
They put civilians in dsi
for this very reason.

21:45.038 --> 21:46.237
- Okay, that's all
well and good,

21:46.372 --> 21:47.738
But how is she supposed
to investigate a murder?

21:47.807 --> 21:50.807
She's not a cop, she has no
interest in getting the context.

21:50.843 --> 21:52.476
- That's not even
the worst part.

21:52.611 --> 21:55.479
- What's the worst part?
- According to my buddy,

21:55.515 --> 21:57.647
She's liking naz
for jake's death.

22:01.187 --> 22:04.187
- Of course. I will keep you
posted, I'm...

22:05.291 --> 22:09.160
Yup. Yup. Oh, believe me,
I get it, I'm...

22:09.162 --> 22:11.328
Yeah. Understood.

22:15.168 --> 22:18.635
Well, this is a shit show.
I told detective nazeer

22:18.671 --> 22:21.104
To stay away from
jake mardy, right? He didn't.

22:21.140 --> 22:24.174
Here we are, he's in dsi holding
up in mississauga

22:24.243 --> 22:26.710
And you folks are all standing
there with a collective look

22:26.746 --> 22:29.980
Of outrage on your adorable,
loyal faces.

22:30.016 --> 22:31.982
Please, tell me
what you'd like me to say?

22:32.051 --> 22:34.284
- Hannah cook isn't a cop,
she's not even in homicide.

22:34.320 --> 22:37.154
- She's as smart as any one
of us, from what I hear. Next.

22:37.156 --> 22:39.323
- We know more about jake mardy,

22:39.325 --> 22:41.192
We know who might be
targeting him.

22:41.327 --> 22:44.295
- I will pass that along.
Ds greene, anything to add?

22:44.430 --> 22:46.096
- Yes. Naz is our friend.

22:46.165 --> 22:47.932
We cannot just sit here
doing nothing.

22:47.934 --> 22:49.133
- Oh, no, no, no.

22:49.202 --> 22:51.735
That is exactly what you are
going to do.

22:51.738 --> 22:52.937
We have to trust the system,

22:53.072 --> 22:55.606
Exhibit zero
conflict of interest.

22:55.608 --> 22:57.608
We cannot be seen
to be meddling.

22:57.677 --> 23:00.211
Am I clear? You do not pass go!

23:00.213 --> 23:01.946
You do not collect $200,

23:02.081 --> 23:05.015
You stand right there
on baltic avenue

23:05.017 --> 23:07.418
Until I hand you back the dice.

23:07.420 --> 23:08.919
- While naz goes
straight to jail.

23:08.921 --> 23:11.689
- I was already regretting
my metaphor, however,

23:11.691 --> 23:13.356
I think you probably
get my drift.

23:14.927 --> 23:19.763
Alright. Work on purple rain
from a new angle, if you want,

23:19.766 --> 23:23.501
Just please stay away
from jake mardy's death.

23:23.636 --> 23:26.369
I will be up in dsi all day.

23:27.306 --> 23:28.839
I will keep you posted.

23:35.815 --> 23:40.050
- Well, she did say we could
work on purple rain.

23:40.052 --> 23:42.052
- So let's work on purple rain.

23:49.595 --> 23:51.395
- I got your message.

23:51.397 --> 23:53.731
Is naz okay?
- Naz is okay, he's in shock.

23:53.733 --> 23:55.065
They have him up
at dsi right now.

23:55.134 --> 23:57.134
- Uh, we should warn you,
we've been instructed

23:57.203 --> 23:59.069
To stay away from this,
by ballard.

23:59.071 --> 24:00.938
Conflict of interest
and whatnot.

24:00.940 --> 24:02.273
- Whatever. We're in.

24:03.943 --> 24:07.878
Right, dack?
- Yes. 100%. 90.

24:08.013 --> 24:09.613
85, really.

24:11.017 --> 24:13.550
Brothers in blue, am I right?
Code beyond blood, beyond words.

24:13.619 --> 24:16.353
A code beyond identity--

24:16.355 --> 24:18.088
- Alright, wrap it up,
dick dack.

24:18.124 --> 24:20.023
Let's... What are the facts?
- Okay, everything we know

24:20.059 --> 24:21.391
Is on this board.

24:27.900 --> 24:29.032
- We don't know much.

24:29.068 --> 24:30.868
- Well, we got
what we could get.

24:31.003 --> 24:33.236
We only had 10 minutes
before dsi showed up.

24:33.272 --> 24:34.404
- That's not what I mean.

24:35.508 --> 24:38.042
Well, it's what I mean,
but the methodology

24:38.177 --> 24:41.978
In homicide, we don't use
a board, we use a book.

24:42.014 --> 24:45.182
A book is discreet,
you can put the pages in,

24:45.184 --> 24:47.184
You can take the pages--
- okay, we don't have a book,

24:47.319 --> 24:49.353
We have a board. You wanna turn
around, see what you see

24:49.488 --> 24:50.654
And tell us please? Thank you.

24:52.324 --> 24:53.790
- Okay, so what was
the time of death?

24:53.860 --> 24:55.792
- Uh, somewhere between
9 and 4 am.

24:55.828 --> 24:58.028
That's approximate,
but it's our best guess.

24:58.064 --> 25:00.430
- And who was the last person
to see jake mardy alive?

25:01.267 --> 25:03.901
I mean, besides naz, obviously.

25:03.970 --> 25:05.269
- We have no idea.

25:06.372 --> 25:08.471
- Hey.
- If it was in a book,

25:08.508 --> 25:10.541
You might have it in your--
- hey.

25:14.880 --> 25:17.915
- How do you investigate
a murder when you don't have
all the facts?

25:17.917 --> 25:21.017
No forensic intelligence,
no autopsy reports,

25:21.053 --> 25:22.819
No other suspects.
- Oh, no, no.

25:22.855 --> 25:25.155
We have other suspects.
Show him.

25:25.157 --> 25:26.891
(clears throat)
- let me see them.

25:27.026 --> 25:28.759
- Jenn diamante.

25:28.828 --> 25:32.096
- Diamante, probably italian
from the province of cosenza

25:32.231 --> 25:35.231
In calabria. Is she swarthy?

25:35.268 --> 25:36.366
Is she swarthy?

25:36.435 --> 25:38.102
- I... I don't know
what that means.

25:38.104 --> 25:40.638
Krish kharche, distributor
of purple rain.

25:40.640 --> 25:44.507
And Tuesday frank, uh,
maker of purple rain,

25:44.544 --> 25:46.843
Both of whom, we believe,
are working with jenn

25:46.845 --> 25:49.313
And both of whom were arrested
based on jake's intelligence.

25:49.382 --> 25:52.916
- Nothing drug dealers
hate more than a snitch.

25:52.985 --> 25:55.385
- And then, we have yolanda
pesci, she's the girlfriend

25:55.454 --> 25:57.187
Of jake mardy, probably holds
a grudge 'cause

25:57.323 --> 25:58.789
She's really pissed that
she was dragged into it,

25:58.791 --> 26:00.690
So it could be a crime
of passion, but we don't know.

26:00.726 --> 26:02.059
- I think we're forgetting
someone.

26:02.128 --> 26:03.193
- Who?

26:04.263 --> 26:06.429
- Detective taai nazeer.
- I don't think so.

26:06.465 --> 26:09.499
- He's young,
he's dumb and he's full of--

26:09.569 --> 26:10.634
- What?

26:11.537 --> 26:13.637
- Vim and vinegar.
- It's vigour.

26:13.639 --> 26:16.807
- Vigour... And purple rain,
betrayed by a high school

26:16.876 --> 26:19.543
Bestie, furious the case
isn't his.

26:19.678 --> 26:21.478
- Okay, can you look at me
for a second?

26:21.547 --> 26:23.080
It's not naz.

26:23.082 --> 26:26.617
- Well, it's staying up there
because we are going

26:26.619 --> 26:28.752
To leave no stone unturned,
am I right?

26:28.754 --> 26:31.855
- Naz didn't do it.
- Well, it's staying up there.

26:31.857 --> 26:35.426
- It's staying up there. We know
that naz didn't do it, okay?

26:35.428 --> 26:37.828
Let's get started now, okay?
Let's check alibis.

26:37.897 --> 26:40.597
Dack, pay attention.
You take Tuesday,

26:40.600 --> 26:43.033
I can take krish,
you guys take yolanda.

26:43.035 --> 26:45.702
- And I will run point
from here. If you need
any digging done,

26:45.771 --> 26:47.237
Call it in.
- Perfect.

26:47.239 --> 26:48.372
- Alright.

26:50.209 --> 26:51.942
- How are your shoes, detective?

26:52.712 --> 26:54.478
- What?
- Your shoes,

26:54.480 --> 26:56.180
I keep telling them,
those plimsolls they hand out,

26:56.315 --> 26:58.849
They have literally no support.
You might as well

26:58.851 --> 27:00.351
Be wearing a piece of paper.

27:00.486 --> 27:01.551
(chuckles)

27:01.587 --> 27:04.187
I like to change my shoes.

27:04.223 --> 27:06.790
Midday. It gives my feet
a fresh start

27:06.826 --> 27:09.793
And a change is as good
as a rest, am I right?

27:11.130 --> 27:13.530
Oh, yeah.
(sighing)

27:13.566 --> 27:15.198
Alright, let's get started.

27:15.267 --> 27:17.333
Hannah cook, dsi.

27:17.370 --> 27:21.071
It is 1:23 pm and I am with
detective taai nazeer.

27:21.140 --> 27:23.941
Okay, I have reviewed
your statement

27:23.943 --> 27:26.209
And I have a few questions.

27:26.245 --> 27:29.479
Jake mardy, he threw your big
drug squad case

27:29.515 --> 27:31.482
By confessing, correct?

27:31.617 --> 27:33.149
- Yeah, falsely confessing.

27:33.185 --> 27:35.819
- Mm, must have been
frustrating.

27:35.821 --> 27:37.521
- Yeah. It was.

27:39.091 --> 27:41.225
He was scared. I mean,
he didn't want to go
into witness protection,

27:41.360 --> 27:43.026
So someone must have
threatened him

27:43.095 --> 27:45.161
Or bribed him to take the fall.

27:45.197 --> 27:48.298
- You two were friends, right?
- Back in high school.

27:48.300 --> 27:49.566
I hadn't seen him in 20 years.

27:49.702 --> 27:52.569
- How much did you drink
last night, detective?

27:53.906 --> 27:56.639
- More than I should have.
- You want to take a guess?

27:57.843 --> 27:59.275
- Maybe six or seven beers.

28:02.048 --> 28:05.982
He didn't want to talk,
he was more into partying.

28:06.052 --> 28:08.786
- Any drugs?
- No. Of course not.

28:10.423 --> 28:12.189
But you read my statement,
so you know that he slipped me
purple rain.

28:12.324 --> 28:17.261
- Ah, I wasn't familiar
with that particular drug
until today, actually.

28:17.396 --> 28:21.197
So you know what I did?
I went to your notes, detective.

28:22.435 --> 28:25.001
Uh... "may 29th..."
etcetera, etcetera, etcetera...

28:25.037 --> 28:26.870
"subjects were excessively
violent,

28:26.872 --> 28:30.540
Irrational and showing signs
of superhuman strength."

28:31.377 --> 28:33.010
"June 10th, subject was manic,

28:33.012 --> 28:35.279
Sweating, destructive
and incoherent.

28:35.414 --> 28:37.814
Takedown ended when subject
went into seizure."

28:37.950 --> 28:40.584
It must have been quite
the party last night.

28:40.719 --> 28:42.919
- Uh, I don't know, I, uh...

28:44.423 --> 28:48.925
I don't remember.
I was pretty messed up,
so it's all, um...

28:50.896 --> 28:52.195
It's all just
a little bit foggy.

28:53.199 --> 28:54.698
- Would you care for some water?

29:00.039 --> 29:04.508
Gloria. Good to see you again.
Sorry about the circumstances.

29:04.577 --> 29:07.710
- Me too. Detective nazeer
is good police.

29:07.747 --> 29:09.913
I'm sure we're gonna be able
to clear this up shortly.

29:10.048 --> 29:12.249
- He was on schedule-a
narcotics,

29:12.384 --> 29:15.385
He doesn't know what happened.
- He was slipped narcotics,

29:15.454 --> 29:18.589
He wasn't on them. And jake
mardy was an old friend

29:18.591 --> 29:22.926
From way back. I mean, honestly,
he must be traumatized.

29:23.061 --> 29:25.629
Can you imagine?
- Not really.

29:25.698 --> 29:28.799
I'm not big on imagination,
it's why I'm good at this job.

29:28.934 --> 29:30.868
- Oh, well then, we'll have
to get you some more facts

29:30.870 --> 29:33.269
Because right now this is
entirely circumstantial.

29:33.305 --> 29:35.472
- I certainly hope so.
Believe it or not,

29:35.607 --> 29:38.542
I don't particularly like
arresting police officers.

29:38.544 --> 29:40.677
- Oh.
- But my team's on it now,

29:40.679 --> 29:42.146
They're working with homicide.

29:42.281 --> 29:44.481
And if there are any other
explanations, gloria,

29:44.616 --> 29:46.783
I am all ears.

29:50.256 --> 29:52.589
(city hubbub)

29:55.360 --> 29:59.830
- We are offering a special
today on a truly miraculous

29:59.899 --> 30:02.699
Energy beverage.
It is a high-potency blend

30:02.701 --> 30:06.937
Of vitamins and nutrients.
Feel free to take a sample here.

30:07.006 --> 30:09.373
Ladies!
- Yolanda.

30:09.375 --> 30:11.508
So good to see you again.

30:11.643 --> 30:13.977
- If you're not buying,
you're not trying.

30:15.281 --> 30:17.780
- Where were you last night?
- None of your business. Why?

30:17.817 --> 30:20.116
- Ooh, I think it is a bit
of our business

30:20.118 --> 30:22.118
Because we're tying up
a few loose threads

30:22.154 --> 30:23.320
In the purple rain case.

30:23.322 --> 30:25.422
- Which I have nothing
to do with.

30:25.557 --> 30:28.458
Anyway, last night, I was
hosting a nutriderma home party

30:28.527 --> 30:31.228
At my friend amber's,
you can call her if you want.

30:31.297 --> 30:33.663
- Okay. Sure. We will.
Uh, when's the last time

30:33.732 --> 30:36.767
That you saw jake?
- I haven't see him in weeks.

30:36.902 --> 30:40.003
He's called a few times,
but I am trying to make
a fresh start,

30:40.039 --> 30:42.005
I didn't want to get tangled up
with him again.

30:42.007 --> 30:43.573
- What do you know
about the prince?

30:43.609 --> 30:46.276
Tuesday frank, jenn diamante,
do those names ring a bell?

30:46.411 --> 30:49.079
- No. I stayed way out
of all that stuff

30:49.148 --> 30:51.848
And it's a good thing too now
that I am an official

30:51.884 --> 30:53.149
Hydra-nutriderma rep.

30:53.185 --> 30:55.685
- Did you know that jake was
planning to leave the country?

30:56.622 --> 30:58.422
- No. Why would he leave
the country?

31:03.696 --> 31:05.028
What is going on?

31:08.100 --> 31:09.432
Is jake alright?

31:10.469 --> 31:11.835
(sighs)

31:11.970 --> 31:14.104
- Uh, yolanda, we're gonna have
to speak to you in private.

31:24.583 --> 31:26.383
Said she was with a friend
last night.

31:26.452 --> 31:29.586
We'll confirm it, but guys,
she seemed genuinely upset.

31:29.721 --> 31:31.054
- What about you guys?

31:31.090 --> 31:33.923
- Krish hopped on a flight
yesterday to cabo, 4 pm.

31:33.959 --> 31:36.226
Airline confirms it.
- Okay, great.

31:36.295 --> 31:38.095
How about Tuesday?
- Ah, Tuesday,

31:38.097 --> 31:40.397
The underappreciated genius,
the chemist

31:40.399 --> 31:42.599
Living in the mobile vehicle.

31:42.601 --> 31:46.069
They... Is very
interesting to me.

31:46.204 --> 31:48.938
- They is?
- They is indeed.

31:48.974 --> 31:52.142
And Tuesday spent the night
in prison.

31:52.144 --> 31:54.211
- They were released yesterday.

31:54.213 --> 31:58.882
- They were, and then Tuesday
punched a guard in the face

31:59.017 --> 32:03.086
On the way out of the clink,
so they... Has an alibi.

32:03.088 --> 32:04.087
Am I saying that right?

32:05.190 --> 32:07.624
- So we've hit a dead end?
- No such thing.

32:07.759 --> 32:09.893
- Oh my god.
- The end is just the beginning.

32:10.863 --> 32:12.829
It's always darkness
before the dawn.

32:13.899 --> 32:16.766
You look harder.
- Okay, we will look harder.

32:16.802 --> 32:18.635
Oh my gosh.
- What?

32:18.637 --> 32:20.770
- Oh, is that the... I need my
glasses, I need my glasses.

32:20.806 --> 32:22.939
Move, move, move. My glasses.
My glasses.

32:24.242 --> 32:26.376
Look, come look, come see
this please, come see this.

32:26.412 --> 32:27.744
Look! Can you see that?

32:27.746 --> 32:29.112
- I don't--
- you can't see it? No?

32:29.247 --> 32:30.947
Here, try these. I just wanna
see what they look like...

32:31.016 --> 32:32.382
I wanna see what they
look like on you.

32:32.517 --> 32:34.184
I bet you look really nice
in glasses. I don't know,

32:34.253 --> 32:36.019
I know you don't need them, go.
What do you see?

32:36.021 --> 32:37.154
- God. Oh.

32:37.289 --> 32:38.388
Oh.
- Yeah?

32:38.424 --> 32:39.856
- Good god.
- Yes!

32:39.892 --> 32:41.524
- Good god.
- What?

32:41.560 --> 32:44.461
- That is hydro-nutriderma.

32:44.530 --> 32:45.862
- Yolanda.

32:45.998 --> 32:47.464
Maybe she was there.

32:49.234 --> 32:54.137
<i>- Okay, yes, I went to see jake</i>
<i> last night, but he was fine.</i>

32:54.139 --> 32:56.539
I mean, he was high as a kite,
but he was fine,

32:56.575 --> 32:59.309
He was alive.
- So you lied to us?

32:59.311 --> 33:00.810
- It was none of your business.

33:01.847 --> 33:04.514
Jake called me yesterday
asking to meet.

33:04.550 --> 33:08.885
He was talking about ecuador and
chile and a bag full of money

33:08.887 --> 33:11.621
He was getting from someone
as a thank you for something.

33:11.690 --> 33:15.658
Would I come? Drop everything?
Leave my entire life behind?

33:17.295 --> 33:21.564
So, after the home party,
amber drove me out to this
falling down house

33:21.633 --> 33:24.167
In markham to say goodbye.
I brought her with me

33:24.169 --> 33:26.102
To make sure I didn't run off
with him.

33:26.238 --> 33:28.238
He was so messed up
when we got there,

33:28.240 --> 33:29.940
I only stayed for like
ten minutes.

33:30.075 --> 33:31.341
- What time did you get there?

33:31.343 --> 33:33.576
- I don't know, maybe like 9:30.

33:33.645 --> 33:35.445
- Did you argue?
- No!

33:35.481 --> 33:37.046
There was nothing
to argue about.

33:37.082 --> 33:40.316
I called him a cosmic screw up,

33:40.352 --> 33:42.786
And then amber pulled me
out of there.

33:42.788 --> 33:44.387
She made me stay over
at her house

33:44.390 --> 33:46.056
So that I wouldn't
change my mind.

33:46.058 --> 33:47.590
- Did you see anyone else there?

33:47.626 --> 33:49.626
Did you go into any
of the other rooms?

33:49.628 --> 33:52.061
- No. No, it was just us.

33:52.097 --> 33:54.464
I mean, I didn't like,
search the place, no.

33:54.533 --> 33:56.533
- You said jake mentioned
something about, uh,

33:56.602 --> 33:58.268
Getting a bag of money
from someone.

33:58.337 --> 33:59.769
Did he have it yet?
- No.

33:59.838 --> 34:00.904
He said it was coming later.

34:01.039 --> 34:02.672
- Did he say
who was bringing it?

34:02.741 --> 34:04.407
Who offered it to him?

34:04.476 --> 34:07.944
- No! He seemed excited,
nervous.

34:07.946 --> 34:10.680
He was so lit, he really wasn't
making any sense.

34:10.749 --> 34:12.416
- What do you mean?
What did he say?

34:12.551 --> 34:15.285
- The pistol shrimp is coming,
the pistol shrimp

34:15.420 --> 34:17.621
Will kill me if I talk.
You see what I mean?

34:17.756 --> 34:19.689
He wasn't making sense!
- Shrimpy!

34:19.758 --> 34:20.490
- Indeed.

34:24.630 --> 34:26.362
- You've had better days.

34:30.569 --> 34:32.235
Sorry about your friend.

34:33.372 --> 34:35.305
I should have started with that.

34:35.307 --> 34:37.674
Uh, no prints on the knife,
by the way.

34:37.809 --> 34:39.242
They were wiped off.

34:40.779 --> 34:41.978
- I don't know, is that good?

34:42.047 --> 34:44.648
- That's neither here nor there.
The thing is...

34:46.251 --> 34:47.450
I'm not sure you're telling me

34:47.519 --> 34:49.285
There whole truth here,
detective.

34:49.922 --> 34:50.921
- What do you mean?

34:52.023 --> 34:53.422
- Do you mind if I show you
something?

34:55.661 --> 34:56.959
Okay, let's get started.

34:57.996 --> 34:59.795
<i> (jake): I gotta get this</i>
<i> for posterity.</i>

34:59.832 --> 35:03.133
- We found this on an old
camcorder in the living room.

35:03.202 --> 35:06.870
<i>(jake): Taai nazeer off his head</i>
<i> on purple rain.</i>

35:07.005 --> 35:09.139
<i> - Stop. Stop!</i>

35:09.141 --> 35:12.375
<i> (jake): Your cop pals</i>
<i> are gonna love it.</i>

35:15.481 --> 35:16.713
<i> - I will kill you!</i>

35:16.782 --> 35:17.681
(thud)

35:18.617 --> 35:20.449
- Yeah, let's fast-forward.

35:21.253 --> 35:22.352
Yeah.

35:24.823 --> 35:28.225
<i> (jake): Almost done.</i>
(laughing)

35:28.227 --> 35:30.226
<i> - What are you doing? Stop.</i>

35:30.262 --> 35:33.163
<i> - Oh my god, bro,</i>
<i> it's so funny.</i>

35:33.232 --> 35:35.298
<i> - Get off of me, man.</i>

35:35.433 --> 35:37.634
<i> Ugh. You're such an asshole.</i>

35:37.636 --> 35:40.637
<i> - Don't be such a pussy, man.</i>

35:40.639 --> 35:42.038
<i> Come on.</i>

35:42.040 --> 35:44.374
<i> - Oh jake...</i>
<i> You know what, jake?</i>

35:44.376 --> 35:46.242
(grunting)
<i> (jake): Ow!</i>

35:46.278 --> 35:47.177
(grunting)
(thudding)

35:47.312 --> 35:49.345
<i> Get off of me.</i>

35:49.381 --> 35:50.513
<i> (naz): Why are you</i>
<i> such a dick?</i>

35:50.516 --> 35:52.282
<i> (jake): Ow!</i>
(grunting)

35:52.351 --> 35:53.383
<i> Are you crazy, man?</i>

35:53.452 --> 35:54.651
<i> - Yeah, I'm crazy!</i>

35:54.786 --> 35:57.620
<i> - Okay, I'll turn it off!</i>
<i> - Turn it off!</i>

35:59.724 --> 36:01.958
- Sounds like you hit him,
wouldn't you say?

36:05.330 --> 36:08.732
- I was... Mad he was
filming me. I...

36:10.569 --> 36:13.469
I would never.
- Ah. Hard to say

36:13.505 --> 36:16.372
What you'd never do when you're
on a drug you've never done.

36:27.586 --> 36:29.953
- Apparently, jake was getting
a bag of money

36:29.955 --> 36:31.354
From someone late last night,

36:31.390 --> 36:33.356
A thank you for taking the fall.
- Yeah, and we believe

36:33.425 --> 36:34.824
Pistol shrimp gave him
the bag of money

36:34.893 --> 36:36.626
And killed him 'cause he talked.

36:36.662 --> 36:40.163
- Jenn diamante, she has
a pistol shrimp on her
left shoulder.

36:41.266 --> 36:43.766
- So, this... This lady's
not only supplying

36:43.802 --> 36:47.036
The chemicals for the drugs,
she is the kingpin,

36:47.072 --> 36:49.505
The top of the food chain!
- Yes. Top. Tippity. Top. Tip.

36:49.541 --> 36:50.906
Uh...
- Hi.

36:50.943 --> 36:52.242
- We were, um...

36:54.446 --> 36:56.913
- I don't know how I could have
been clearer.

36:57.048 --> 37:00.383
You were not to investigate
this death.

37:00.385 --> 37:04.788
Did I stutter? Did... Did my
metaphor fly over your heads?

37:04.923 --> 37:07.923
What could I have possibly done
to have been clearer?

37:07.960 --> 37:08.792
- Nothing.

37:09.995 --> 37:11.260
There is literally nothing
you could have said

37:11.296 --> 37:12.462
That would have stopped us.

37:13.932 --> 37:15.465
- Oh my--
- gloria, we're a team.

37:16.801 --> 37:18.468
And we would have done
the exact same thing for you.

37:21.073 --> 37:22.538
(clears throat)

37:22.574 --> 37:24.874
- Well, you wouldn't
have had to...

37:26.144 --> 37:29.145
Because I wouldn't have gone
to see a disgraced ci.

37:30.515 --> 37:34.083
I-I wouldn't have drank six
beers laced with purple rain.

37:34.152 --> 37:37.420
I wouldn't have fought
with my old friend, on tape,

37:37.489 --> 37:39.222
And threatened to kill him.

37:40.925 --> 37:41.891
(sighs)

37:44.463 --> 37:46.162
They're charging naz...

37:47.165 --> 37:48.898
With second-degree murder.

38:06.518 --> 38:08.184
They must have been chasing
after the hordes.

38:08.186 --> 38:11.120
(groaning)
stop, stop, it's too scary.

38:11.156 --> 38:12.455
(laughing)

38:12.524 --> 38:14.324
- Wow, that took a lot of ammo.
- Yeah.

38:14.459 --> 38:17.460
- Oh. Oh yeah, you're gonna
serve me well, my friend.

38:17.595 --> 38:18.828
(laughing)
- nice.

38:18.864 --> 38:20.863
Aw, good one. Yeah.

38:20.899 --> 38:22.265
(door buzzing)

38:22.334 --> 38:24.734
Ooh, I think I could be
a zombie killer

38:24.736 --> 38:26.336
If we ever get
to the apocalypse.

38:26.338 --> 38:27.937
- This is better
than a real gun.

38:27.973 --> 38:30.806
- Yeah, I know, right?
(laughing)

38:30.842 --> 38:32.275
- Guys, I got next.

38:32.410 --> 38:34.010
- We haven't been attacked
in too long.

38:34.079 --> 38:36.212
- I know.
Whoa, do you see that?

38:36.214 --> 38:37.881
- What?
- Right there, to your left...

38:38.016 --> 38:39.949
(screaming)

38:40.085 --> 38:41.951
(laughing)

38:42.020 --> 38:43.386
Oh, my god!

38:43.455 --> 38:46.122
- Ooh. Oh.

38:47.892 --> 38:49.258
(electronic whirring)
(groaning)

38:51.162 --> 38:52.529
(suspenseful music)

38:55.633 --> 38:57.233
- We have been working
the purple rain case,

38:57.235 --> 38:58.934
Just like you said, and we
believe it is connected

38:58.970 --> 39:00.437
To jake's murder.
- Okay.

39:00.439 --> 39:02.572
- And we think Tuesday's been
making this purple rain

39:02.641 --> 39:05.274
With a woman named
jenn diamante.

39:05.310 --> 39:09.445
- The same jenn diamante I met
last night at your party

39:09.481 --> 39:12.449
With the... Who owns
the fish store?

39:12.584 --> 39:14.451
- Yeah, one and the same.
We believe jenn is providing

39:14.453 --> 39:16.186
The chemicals and the funding
and making the deals.

39:16.188 --> 39:18.054
Tuesday's just making the drugs.

39:18.189 --> 39:20.923
- Okay. Hold on. Back up.

39:20.959 --> 39:23.159
- Boss, we followed
the chemicals.

39:23.294 --> 39:26.328
Jenn's been buying a crap ton of
potassium and permanganic acid,

39:26.365 --> 39:29.232
Both are a signature element
in purple rain.

39:29.234 --> 39:30.734
- Yeah, and then we followed
the finances, and jenn

39:30.869 --> 39:33.203
Made four huge payments
to a shell company in
the past three months.

39:33.338 --> 39:35.805
- Then we followed the history.

39:35.841 --> 39:38.674
Jenn and her best friend
ro wells both have juvie records

39:38.710 --> 39:41.344
For possession, intent to sell,
assault, you name it.

39:41.479 --> 39:44.013
These women were career
criminals at 16 years old.

39:44.082 --> 39:47.217
- Wait, wait.
Ro wells the defence lawyer,

39:47.352 --> 39:49.886
Works are your husband's firm?
I thought she was...

39:49.955 --> 39:52.155
Was she not your friend?
- Yeah, so did I.

39:52.157 --> 39:53.856
I really thought she was,
and then...

39:54.793 --> 39:56.959
She had access
to my home computer.

39:56.995 --> 39:58.995
- She what?
- We believe that happened

39:58.997 --> 40:00.629
When I was off
with my concussion.

40:00.665 --> 40:02.698
- But we know that Tuesday's
lawyer is the one

40:02.734 --> 40:05.201
Who figured out the identity
of our confidential informant.

40:05.237 --> 40:07.537
Well, that blew up
our whole case.

40:07.539 --> 40:09.839
We think it was ro wells.
(sighing)

40:09.841 --> 40:12.041
- And this is how it connects
to jake and his death.

40:12.043 --> 40:13.376
(phone vibrating)

40:13.445 --> 40:15.110
- It's swallows. Hey.

40:16.681 --> 40:19.782
Okay. Okay, don't move,
we'll be right there.

40:19.785 --> 40:21.384
Commander, we got a situation.

40:22.220 --> 40:24.119
(sirens blaring)

40:26.024 --> 40:28.057
(indistinct chatter)

40:32.730 --> 40:34.830
- I'm sorry, we got soft.

40:34.866 --> 40:36.466
Nothing had happened all day.

40:36.535 --> 40:38.334
- Okay, did you pull
all the security footage?

40:38.470 --> 40:40.203
- Yes. Swallows is on that
right now.

40:40.205 --> 40:41.237
- Okay, let's go.

40:43.408 --> 40:45.809
(man 1): You think he's out?
(man 2): Definitely.

40:45.944 --> 40:47.376
50,000 volts will do it.

40:47.446 --> 40:50.213
Did you spot any eyes on us
when we bagged him?

40:50.282 --> 40:52.549
- No witnesses, but there were
a lot of windows,

40:52.551 --> 40:54.884
Cars, apartments.
You never know.

40:54.953 --> 40:56.552
(grunts)

41:01.359 --> 41:03.692
(indistinct chatter)
- how far are we out?

41:03.728 --> 41:05.761
- 30 minutes.

41:10.302 --> 41:12.167
- Don't take the garden, man.

41:12.204 --> 41:14.370
- You think the lakeshore's
any better?

41:14.439 --> 41:16.272
- When we're done with him,

41:16.308 --> 41:17.907
You're gonna wipe the car
for prints.

41:17.943 --> 41:19.441
Send it to the scrapyard.

41:19.478 --> 41:21.444
I don't want any trace
of us in here.

41:25.917 --> 41:28.251
(breathing heavily)

41:39.331 --> 41:42.532
(groaning)

41:42.601 --> 41:44.667
(tires screeching)

41:44.703 --> 41:46.068
(honking)

42:07.025 --> 42:08.624
- Commander, are you seeing
what we're seeing?

42:11.963 --> 42:13.563
- Yes, I'm afraid I am.

42:13.632 --> 42:15.365
- These guys are not
messing around.

42:15.500 --> 42:17.433
They're organized,
highly trained.

42:17.502 --> 42:19.435
- Jenn and ro were the only ones
that knew the location

42:19.471 --> 42:20.903
Of the fake safe house.

42:22.073 --> 42:23.372
- Whatever gang
they're working with,

42:23.408 --> 42:25.041
They got some serious
firepower.

42:25.176 --> 42:27.110
We gotta find out who and fast,

42:27.245 --> 42:29.178
If we're ever gonna get watts
back in one piece.

42:29.180 --> 42:31.447
- God, do we think
he's even still alive?

42:31.483 --> 42:33.583
<i> Don't answer that,</i>
<i> I'm calling shanks,</i>

42:33.652 --> 42:36.485
<i> I'm calling etf, I'm about</i>
<i>to pull every single fire alarm</i>

42:36.555 --> 42:37.886
<i> We have in this place.</i>
(door opening)

42:37.923 --> 42:39.254
- Hold on, commander!

42:39.291 --> 42:40.089
Watts?!

42:44.762 --> 42:47.196
(crying)

42:50.335 --> 42:52.334
- Hey, what's going on?

42:53.004 --> 42:55.271
- Watts. He's back.

42:55.273 --> 42:56.372
(sighs)

42:59.244 --> 43:02.911
- He's a little banged up,
but... He's back.

43:04.416 --> 43:06.749
- Boss, are you still there?
- I am.

43:06.785 --> 43:09.619
- So what do you say?
- I say I'm in.

43:10.822 --> 43:12.588
Let's get these bitches.

43:38.016 --> 43:41.050
