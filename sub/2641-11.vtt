WEBVTT

00:04.938 --> 00:06.372
Oh, I always tear up

00:06.439 --> 00:08.607
when the Grinch's heart
grows three sizes.

00:08.675 --> 00:10.637
Tears seem appropriate.

00:10.705 --> 00:12.294
Enlargement of the heart muscle,

00:12.362 --> 00:14.667
or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,
is a serious disease

00:14.734 --> 00:16.731
which could lead to congestive
heart failure.

00:21.032 --> 00:23.266
You really didn't
like it, Sheldon?

00:23.333 --> 00:24.766
No, on the contrary.

00:24.834 --> 00:27.239
I found the Grinch
to be a relatable,

00:27.306 --> 00:29.280
engaging character.

00:29.348 --> 00:30.451
And I was really

00:30.519 --> 00:31.952
with him right up to the point

00:32.020 --> 00:33.657
that he succumbed
to social convention

00:33.725 --> 00:36.663
and returned the presents
and saved Christmas.

00:36.731 --> 00:38.800
What a buzz kill that was.

00:40.840 --> 00:43.643
When we watch Frosty the
Snowman, he roots for the sun.

00:43.711 --> 00:45.280
Excuse me,

00:45.348 --> 00:48.050
but the sun is essential
for all life on Earth.

00:48.117 --> 00:49.418
Frosty is merely

00:49.486 --> 00:53.824
a bit of frozen supernatural
ephemera in a stolen hat.

00:53.892 --> 00:56.926
A crime, by the way, for which
he is never brought to account.

00:58.000 --> 01:04.074

01:29.441 --> 01:32.076
I just love decorating
the Christmas tree.
HELP YOU FIND
THE PERFECT GIFT

01:32.143 --> 01:34.545
It makes me feel like
a little girl again.

01:34.613 --> 01:36.847
We didn't have a tree
when I was growing up.

01:36.915 --> 01:38.382
Really? Why not?

01:38.450 --> 01:40.217
Mmm, in my family,

01:40.285 --> 01:42.554
holidays weren't so much
celebrated as studied

01:42.621 --> 01:45.057
for their anthropological and
psychological implications

01:45.124 --> 01:46.391
on human society.

01:46.459 --> 01:48.394
Oh, sounds festive.

01:48.461 --> 01:50.029
Did you at least give presents?

01:50.096 --> 01:51.797
Mmm, in a way.

01:51.865 --> 01:53.866
We presented papers.

01:55.402 --> 01:58.571
And then broke off into focus
groups and critiqued each other.

01:59.707 --> 02:00.807
Sheldon, what about you?

02:00.874 --> 02:02.241
Did you have a
Christmas tree?

02:02.309 --> 02:04.577
Oh, yes.

02:04.645 --> 02:07.079
We had a tree, we had a manger,

02:07.146 --> 02:08.747
we had an inflatable Santa Claus

02:08.815 --> 02:11.082
with plastic reindeer
on the front lawn.

02:11.150 --> 02:12.550
And to make
things even

02:12.618 --> 02:15.019
more jolly, there were so many
blinking lights on the house

02:15.087 --> 02:17.688
they induced neighborhood-wide
seizures.

02:17.755 --> 02:20.591
So I take it you don't want
to help us trim the tree.

02:20.659 --> 02:21.792
I do not.

02:21.860 --> 02:23.294
But if you insist

02:23.362 --> 02:26.764
on decorating a spider-infested
fire hazard in my home

02:26.832 --> 02:29.268
I would request that
you add this.

02:29.335 --> 02:30.602
What is it?

02:30.670 --> 02:33.273
You're kidding, right?

02:33.340 --> 02:36.242
It's a bust of Sir Isaac Newton.

02:37.278 --> 02:38.512
Oh, sure, sure.

02:38.580 --> 02:39.747
Very Christmasy.

02:39.815 --> 02:41.682
Wait, excuse me,
but it's much

02:41.750 --> 02:44.251
more "Christmasy" than anything
you've put on the tree.

02:44.319 --> 02:45.252
Here we go.

02:45.320 --> 02:48.756
December 25, 1642,

02:48.823 --> 02:51.358
Julian calendar,
Sir Isaac Newton is born.

02:51.426 --> 02:53.427
Jesus, on the other hand,
was actually born

02:53.495 --> 02:55.362
in the summer--
His birthday was moved

02:55.430 --> 02:57.364
to coincide with a traditional
pagan holiday

02:57.432 --> 02:59.200
that celebrated
the winter solstice

02:59.267 --> 03:00.968
with lit fires and
slaughtered goats.

03:01.036 --> 03:02.603
Which, frankly,

03:02.671 --> 03:05.072
sounds like more fun than 12
hours of church with my mother

03:05.140 --> 03:06.574
followed by a fruitcake.

03:07.609 --> 03:10.211
Merry Newton-mas, everyone.

03:10.279 --> 03:13.181
I sense that's not sincere,
although I have no idea why.

03:14.450 --> 03:16.017
No, it's fine.
Look, Sir Issac can go

03:16.084 --> 03:17.451
right next to this
little candy cane.

03:17.519 --> 03:20.288
No. Isaac goes at the top
of the tree.

03:20.355 --> 03:22.056
No, he doesn't.

03:22.124 --> 03:23.490
I understand.

03:23.558 --> 03:26.193
You dispute Newton's claim
that he invented calculus

03:26.261 --> 03:29.228
and you want to put Gottfried
Leibniz on the top.

03:29.296 --> 03:30.430
Yeah, you got me.

03:30.497 --> 03:31.798
I'm a Leibniz man.

03:31.865 --> 03:33.632
Well, perhaps when
your mother gets here,

03:33.700 --> 03:35.167
she'll talk some sense into you.

03:35.235 --> 03:36.368
What?

03:36.436 --> 03:37.970
Your-your mother's
coming? When?

03:38.038 --> 03:38.971
Tomorrow.

03:39.038 --> 03:40.740
When were you going
to tell me?

03:40.807 --> 03:42.909
Um... tomorrow?

03:42.976 --> 03:45.512
Why were you keeping
this a secret?

03:45.580 --> 03:46.713
Well, I just--
I thought...

03:46.781 --> 03:48.548
If I can interject here,

03:48.616 --> 03:50.384
obviously Leonard is concerned

03:50.451 --> 03:52.786
that his mother won't approve
of you as his mate.

03:52.854 --> 03:55.623
Why wouldn't she approve of me?

03:55.690 --> 03:57.258
I'm adorable.

03:57.325 --> 03:59.093
You are, it's just...

03:59.161 --> 04:01.595
If I can interject again.

04:01.663 --> 04:05.265
Leonard comes from a remarkably
high-achieving family,

04:05.333 --> 04:07.300
who have all chosen
high-achieving partners.

04:07.368 --> 04:08.935
He probably feels

04:09.003 --> 04:11.738
that it's doubtful that his
mother will be overly impressed

04:11.805 --> 04:14.573
with his dating a woman whose
most significant achievement

04:14.641 --> 04:17.509
is memorizing
the Cheesecake Factory menu.

04:17.577 --> 04:19.678
Hey, it's a big menu.

04:21.113 --> 04:22.848
There's two pages
just for desserts.

04:22.916 --> 04:24.083
I know.

04:24.151 --> 04:26.285
And those specials--
they change every day.

04:26.353 --> 04:28.755
Okay, you know what?
It's lame when I say it.

04:28.822 --> 04:30.791
It's just ridiculous
when you pile on.
Okay.

04:30.859 --> 04:32.125
Sorry.

04:32.193 --> 04:34.128
So what did she say when you
told her we were going out?

04:36.399 --> 04:38.700
You didn't tell her
we were going out, did you?

04:40.903 --> 04:42.337
Why not?

04:42.405 --> 04:44.672
Leonard...

04:44.740 --> 04:46.273
I'm no expert on meditation,

04:46.341 --> 04:47.908
but if you're trying
to calm yourself down,

04:47.976 --> 04:49.676
I believe the word is "Om."

04:53.147 --> 04:54.414
It was so nice of you

04:54.481 --> 04:56.449
to come all the way down
to the airport to pick me up.

04:56.517 --> 04:57.817
No trouble at all.

04:57.885 --> 04:59.885
I drove, Mother.

05:01.087 --> 05:03.022
I'm driving now.

05:03.090 --> 05:04.557
Yes, dear. Mommy's proud.

05:05.726 --> 05:07.494
I've been meaning
to thank you

05:07.561 --> 05:08.728
for your notes on my paper

05:08.796 --> 05:10.296
disproving quantum
brain dynamic theory.

05:10.364 --> 05:11.497
My pleasure.

05:11.565 --> 05:13.065
For a non-physicist,

05:13.133 --> 05:14.734
you have a remarkable grasp

05:14.802 --> 05:17.403
of how electric dipoles in
the brain's water molecules

05:17.471 --> 05:20.206
could not possibly form
a Bose condensate.

05:20.274 --> 05:21.674
Wait, wait, wait.

05:21.742 --> 05:24.577
When did you send my mom notes
on a paper?

05:24.645 --> 05:26.413
August 16.

05:26.481 --> 05:28.615
Right after
her carpal tunnel surgery.

05:30.085 --> 05:31.685
Oh, did I thank you
for the flowers?
You did.

05:31.753 --> 05:33.387
I don't really like flowers.

05:33.455 --> 05:35.356
Neither do I, but it's
the social convention.

05:35.424 --> 05:37.525
It is, isn't it?

05:37.593 --> 05:39.527
Wait, wait, wait.
You had surgery?

05:39.594 --> 05:41.361
Yes, and Sheldon
sent me flowers.

05:41.429 --> 05:42.696
No, I heard that.

05:42.764 --> 05:45.366
Then what was all that
"wait, wait, wait" about?

05:45.433 --> 05:47.034
I just don't understand

05:47.102 --> 05:49.871
why he knows more
about your life than I do.

05:49.939 --> 05:51.506
Well, I would assume
it's because Sheldon

05:51.574 --> 05:53.775
and I stay in touch due to
mutual interest and respect,

05:53.843 --> 05:55.143
while you avoid me,

05:55.211 --> 05:57.612
due to unresolved
childhood issues.

05:57.680 --> 05:58.947
It's what we think

05:59.014 --> 06:01.316
caused your narcissistic
personality disorder.

06:02.785 --> 06:05.721
We discussed it at length
during our last video chat.

06:05.789 --> 06:08.925
Although how we got onto the
subject of you is baffling.

06:08.993 --> 06:11.261
Yes, but we are
on the subject,

06:11.329 --> 06:12.963
so I'm obliged to ask.

06:13.031 --> 06:15.299
Leonard, how are you?

06:15.367 --> 06:17.735
Fine, Mom. How are you?

06:17.803 --> 06:19.104
Mmm, menopausal.

06:19.171 --> 06:22.740
Now I'm less fine.

06:22.808 --> 06:24.642
Have you heard your brother
has gotten engaged?

06:24.709 --> 06:26.143
No.

06:26.211 --> 06:28.145
Sheldon, why didn't
you tell me?

06:28.212 --> 06:29.979
My bad.

06:30.047 --> 06:32.582
I did send a gift
from both of us.

06:32.649 --> 06:34.350
She's a remarkable girl.

06:34.417 --> 06:36.351
The youngest appeals court
judge in New Jersey

06:36.419 --> 06:38.887
and a two-time Olympic
bronze medalist.

06:38.988 --> 06:40.922
You must be very happy.

06:40.990 --> 06:42.724
Why?
I'm not marrying her.

06:44.260 --> 06:45.527
So, how about you?

06:45.594 --> 06:47.262
Are you seeing anyone
interesting?

06:47.329 --> 06:49.430
Well, I'm not sure about
interesting, but...

06:49.498 --> 06:51.232
Not the time, Sheldon.

06:51.300 --> 06:52.434
Very well.

06:52.501 --> 06:54.135
Shall we switch topics

06:54.203 --> 06:57.171
to Isaac Newton
v. Gottfried Leibniz?

06:57.239 --> 06:59.006
It's all right, Sheldon.

06:59.074 --> 07:00.207
I will just pretend

07:00.275 --> 07:02.109
that Leonard's not
withholding information.

07:02.176 --> 07:04.778
Although,
I will point out, Leonard,

07:04.845 --> 07:06.779
that I am a trained psychiatrist

07:06.847 --> 07:09.615
and you are exhibiting the same
secretive behavioral tics

07:09.683 --> 07:11.884
that accompanied your learning
to masturbate.

07:14.921 --> 07:17.856
Isn't she brilliant,
Leonard?

07:17.924 --> 07:20.558
How I envy you.

07:21.928 --> 07:23.362
So, Howard,

07:23.430 --> 07:25.198
have you and Rajesh finally
summoned the courage

07:25.266 --> 07:27.233
to express your latent
homosexual feelings

07:27.301 --> 07:29.503
toward one another?

07:32.941 --> 07:34.909
What? No.

07:34.976 --> 07:36.343
Why not?

07:38.380 --> 07:40.314
Because we don't have latent
homosexual feelings

07:40.382 --> 07:41.716
toward one another.

07:41.783 --> 07:43.717
I see.

07:43.785 --> 07:45.719
No, really.

07:45.787 --> 07:47.388
I have a girlfriend now.

07:47.455 --> 07:48.822
And where is she this evening?

07:48.890 --> 07:50.491
She had to go
out of town.

07:50.559 --> 07:51.992
Her grandmother died.

07:52.060 --> 07:54.095
I see.

07:54.162 --> 07:56.530
Her grandmother died.

07:57.932 --> 07:59.600
Honest to God.

07:59.667 --> 08:01.768
Leonard, tell her I
have a girlfriend.

08:01.836 --> 08:03.837
I don't know what
you're talking about.

08:03.905 --> 08:06.674
What do you mean you
don't know what I'm
talking about?

08:06.742 --> 08:07.942
Tell her I have
a girlfriend!

08:08.010 --> 08:10.112
All right.

08:10.180 --> 08:12.114
He "has" a "girlfriend."

08:13.750 --> 08:15.685
Her name is Bernadette.
She's working as a waitress,

08:15.753 --> 08:18.054
but she's going to school
to be a microbiologist.

08:18.122 --> 08:19.923
Howard, keep in mind
that the more passionately

08:19.991 --> 08:21.091
you stick to this construct,

08:21.159 --> 08:22.493
the more you're hurting
your partner.

08:26.831 --> 08:29.833
Do you really think your
lips in my ear is helping?

08:30.868 --> 08:33.135
Hi.
Sorry I'm late.

08:33.203 --> 08:34.571
Oh, glad you're here.
Uh, sit down.

08:34.639 --> 08:35.605
I'll get you a plate.

08:35.673 --> 08:36.938
Mom, you remember Penny.

08:37.006 --> 08:38.808
Oh, yes, the waitress
slash actress

08:38.876 --> 08:42.044
with the unresolved
father issues.

08:42.113 --> 08:43.313
Has he finally
come to terms

08:43.381 --> 08:46.317
with his little slugger
growing breasts?

08:46.385 --> 08:49.320
Well, he sent me a football and
a catcher's mitt for Christmas,

08:49.388 --> 08:51.656
so I'm going to say no.

08:51.724 --> 08:54.727
If it helps, we're all
good with your breasts.

08:57.130 --> 08:59.766
Classic overcompensation.

09:01.135 --> 09:02.769
Oh, speaking of
fathers, Leonard,

09:02.836 --> 09:04.803
that reminds me,
I'm divorcing your father.

09:04.871 --> 09:07.005
What?!

09:07.073 --> 09:08.407
Yes. He was
cheating on me.

09:08.475 --> 09:10.409
No!
Yes, with some
waitress

09:10.477 --> 09:12.044
from the university
cafeteria.

09:12.112 --> 09:13.245
Can you believe it?

09:13.313 --> 09:15.280
A waitress?

09:15.348 --> 09:17.348
Oh, no offense, dear.

09:18.384 --> 09:20.785
No, it sounded like
a compliment.

09:22.187 --> 09:23.355
When did this happen?

09:23.422 --> 09:24.656
Mmm, well, let's see.

09:24.723 --> 09:26.324
Sheldon, when did I
leave Leonard's father?

09:27.360 --> 09:28.660
September 22.

09:28.728 --> 09:29.828
Oh, yes, that's right.

09:29.895 --> 09:31.163
The weekend after
Leonard's dog died.

09:31.231 --> 09:33.232
Mitzy's dead?!

09:34.835 --> 09:36.769
She was old and blind, Leonard.

09:36.837 --> 09:39.606
What choice did we have?

09:39.673 --> 09:40.740
I don't believe this.

09:40.808 --> 09:42.375
Why am I the last to know?!

09:42.443 --> 09:44.544
Excuse me, Leonard, I am the
one who's getting a divorce,

09:44.611 --> 09:45.945
Mitzy is the one
who is dead.

09:46.013 --> 09:48.180
Why are you the one
making a fuss?

09:48.248 --> 09:49.448
You're right.

09:49.515 --> 09:50.482
I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm sorry.

09:50.549 --> 09:52.550
I'm way out
of line!

09:55.354 --> 09:57.789
So, Penny, what's new
in your life?

09:57.856 --> 09:58.823
Nothing.

09:58.891 --> 10:01.559
Not a damn thing.

10:07.532 --> 10:10.267
Thank you for driving
me back to my hotel.

10:10.335 --> 10:11.768
Oh, it's not a problem.

10:11.836 --> 10:13.837
I was going to ask
Leonard to do it,

10:13.904 --> 10:16.139
but he seemed a bit
emotionally unstable

10:16.207 --> 10:19.442
and you don't want someone like
that operating heavy machinery.

10:19.509 --> 10:21.377
No, you do not.

10:21.444 --> 10:23.845
Your "check engine" light is on.

10:23.913 --> 10:27.684
Yeah, I gotta put
a sticker over that.

10:30.454 --> 10:33.423
So, uh, you must be
devastated about your divorce.

10:33.491 --> 10:34.758
Oh, not at all.

10:34.826 --> 10:37.795
But I am a bit distressed
to be in a vehicle

10:37.863 --> 10:40.632
that's not subjected
to regular maintenance.

10:40.700 --> 10:42.868
Come on, I mean,
you're not upset

10:42.935 --> 10:44.302
that your marriage is over?

10:44.370 --> 10:48.940
Well, initially I felt something
akin to grief and perhaps anger,

10:49.008 --> 10:52.043
but that's the natural reaction
of the limbic system

10:52.111 --> 10:54.946
to being betrayed
by a loathsome
son of a bitch.

10:55.014 --> 10:56.982
Sure, sure.

10:57.049 --> 10:59.217
Thankfully, my shock was
somewhat mitigated by the fact

10:59.285 --> 11:01.753
that I haven't had intercourse
with him in eight years.

11:01.821 --> 11:03.555
Eight years?

11:03.622 --> 11:05.089
Oh, that's nothing.

11:05.157 --> 11:09.561
I've been responsible
for my own orgasms since 1982.

11:09.628 --> 11:11.496
Yikes.

11:13.800 --> 11:17.069
What's so funny?

11:17.136 --> 11:21.840
That's exactly what I say
during orgasms: "Yikes."

11:21.907 --> 11:23.341
You know what?
I could use a drink.

11:23.409 --> 11:24.843
Do you want to
stop for a drink?

11:24.910 --> 11:27.212
Oh, I don't drink.
I do, I'll teach you.

11:28.581 --> 11:30.316
Leonard?

11:30.383 --> 11:31.751
Leonard?

11:31.818 --> 11:33.419
Leonard...?

11:33.487 --> 11:35.555
What is it?

11:37.392 --> 11:38.659
I made tea.

11:38.727 --> 11:41.162
I don't want tea.

11:41.229 --> 11:44.131
I didn't make tea for you.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.934
This is my tea.

11:48.002 --> 11:50.302
Then why are you telling me?

11:50.370 --> 11:52.938
It's a conversation starter.

11:53.006 --> 11:56.141
That's a lousy
conversation starter.

11:56.209 --> 11:57.609
Oh, is it?
We're conversing.

11:57.677 --> 11:59.177
Checkmate.

11:59.245 --> 12:01.780
What do you want, Sheldon?

12:01.848 --> 12:04.550
What I want is to be departing
the starship Enterprise

12:04.618 --> 12:07.587
in a one-man shuttle craft
headed to the planetoid I rule

12:07.654 --> 12:09.956
known as Sheldon Alpha Five.

12:10.024 --> 12:12.492
I want that too.

12:13.527 --> 12:14.961
Why are you here?

12:15.029 --> 12:16.897
To comfort you, of course.

12:19.267 --> 12:21.869
No, that's not
going to work at all.

12:21.937 --> 12:24.205
I'll comfort you
from over here.

12:27.041 --> 12:30.977
Leonard, what you're
experiencing

12:31.045 --> 12:33.279
is a classic Jungian crisis

12:33.346 --> 12:36.648
in which the aging
individual mourns the loss

12:36.716 --> 12:39.684
of the never-to-be realized
ideal family unit.

12:39.752 --> 12:41.319
Thank you,
that's very comforting.

12:41.387 --> 12:43.354
That's not the comforting part.

12:43.422 --> 12:45.156
It's not?

12:45.224 --> 12:46.391
No, no.

12:46.459 --> 12:48.894
The comforting part
is that the Germans

12:48.962 --> 12:50.930
have a term
for what you're feeling.

12:50.997 --> 12:52.365
Weltschmerz.

12:52.432 --> 12:54.066
It means

12:54.134 --> 12:57.371
the depression that arises from
comparing the world as it is

12:57.439 --> 13:00.908
to a hypothetical,
idealized world.

13:00.976 --> 13:03.545
You're right, I do feel better.

13:03.613 --> 13:07.416
Well, the Germans have
always been a comforting people.

13:09.953 --> 13:13.388
Just remember, Leonard,
where your biological family

13:13.456 --> 13:17.726
has failed you, you always
have me, your surrogate family.

13:19.429 --> 13:21.797
You're my surrogate family?

13:21.865 --> 13:24.699
If it's any consolation,
I'm not happy about it either.

13:24.767 --> 13:26.101
Good night.

13:29.272 --> 13:33.042
Okay, now this time try
drinking it all at once.

13:42.685 --> 13:45.019
Yikes.

13:46.689 --> 13:51.725
I've been responsible
for my own buzz since 2003.

13:51.793 --> 13:55.796
Another round for me
and my homegirl.

13:55.863 --> 14:00.566
I feel a spreading warmth
through my extremities.

14:00.634 --> 14:02.134
As long as you don't feel it

14:02.202 --> 14:03.469
running down your pants,
you're fine.

14:11.812 --> 14:15.683
Oh, that is fascinating.

14:15.750 --> 14:19.320
I'm noticing an immediate
lowering of my inhibitions.

14:19.388 --> 14:21.489
For example,

14:21.557 --> 14:24.325
I'm seriously considering
asking that busboy

14:24.393 --> 14:29.563
to ravish me in the alleyway
while I eat cheesecake.

14:29.630 --> 14:31.498
What do you think?

14:31.565 --> 14:35.368
Well, we are known
for our cheesecake.

14:35.436 --> 14:38.471
Hit us again.
Yes.

14:38.538 --> 14:42.274
If a little is good,
more must be better.

14:42.342 --> 14:44.977
Hey, Bev, guess what?
What?

14:45.045 --> 14:46.979
I'm sleeping with your son.

14:47.047 --> 14:51.150
Really? Which one?

14:53.187 --> 14:57.558
The one from whom
I live across the hall... from.

14:57.626 --> 14:58.726
Well, that's convenient.

14:58.794 --> 15:01.662
How did his penis turn out?

15:01.730 --> 15:06.367
Oh, Beverly, I can't talk
to my boyfriend's mother

15:06.434 --> 15:07.968
about his penis.
Oh, fair enough.

15:08.036 --> 15:09.636
What can you tell me,
if anything,

15:09.704 --> 15:12.071
about that busboy's penis?

15:16.309 --> 15:19.145
actually, I've only
had the cheesecake.

15:19.212 --> 15:22.081
One more time.

15:22.148 --> 15:25.551
You know, Leonard did not want
to tell you we were dating.

15:25.618 --> 15:26.852
Really?

15:26.920 --> 15:28.553
Well, that means
he's either

15:28.621 --> 15:29.921
embarrassed about
the relationship

15:29.989 --> 15:31.957
or he doesn't care
enough about his mother

15:32.025 --> 15:33.658
to tell her he's in one.

15:33.726 --> 15:37.763
Either way, one of us
should be insulted.

15:37.831 --> 15:40.699
Well, let's go find out who.

15:40.767 --> 15:42.201
You go get a taxi.

15:42.269 --> 15:44.371
I'm gonna slip
my business card

15:44.438 --> 15:46.339
into that busboy's
back pocket,

15:46.407 --> 15:51.612
cupping his firm, right
buttock as I do so.

15:53.983 --> 15:55.617
Leonard...?

15:55.685 --> 15:58.120
Sonny boy!

15:58.188 --> 15:59.255
Get out here!

15:59.322 --> 16:01.624
Your mommy wants to talk to you!

16:02.792 --> 16:05.260
What the hell is going on?

16:05.328 --> 16:08.696
:
You're in trouble.

16:08.764 --> 16:12.433
Why didn't you tell me
you were tapping my homegirl?

16:16.337 --> 16:18.905
Did I say that right?

16:18.973 --> 16:20.940
Yeah, not bad, not bad.

16:21.008 --> 16:23.710
Are you guys drunk?

16:23.778 --> 16:25.045
Well, I hope so.

16:25.113 --> 16:28.349
Otherwise, why would we
have stopped at Del Taco?

16:29.484 --> 16:31.386
Now, how could
you not tell me

16:31.453 --> 16:32.754
you were in a relationship

16:32.855 --> 16:35.224
with this lovely,
charming young woman?

16:35.291 --> 16:37.459
Oh, thank you.
You're welcome.

16:37.527 --> 16:39.128
Is it because
she's uneducated,

16:39.195 --> 16:42.598
trapped in a menial
service position?

16:42.666 --> 16:44.767
What the hell happened
to "lovely and charming"?

16:45.969 --> 16:47.569
How come you didn't tell me

16:47.637 --> 16:49.738
that you and Father
were getting a divorce?

16:49.806 --> 16:51.407
How come you didn't
tell me you had surgery?

16:51.475 --> 16:53.809
How come you didn't
tell me my dog died?

16:53.877 --> 16:55.977
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait...

16:56.045 --> 16:58.246
What I hear you saying

16:58.313 --> 17:03.617
is that you want a more intimate
mother-son relationship.

17:03.685 --> 17:05.786
I do.

17:14.929 --> 17:16.730
There. It's late.

17:16.798 --> 17:19.032
Now, go to bed.

17:29.678 --> 17:34.614
I'm getting a warm feeling
spreading through my heart.

17:34.682 --> 17:37.517
That's the Del Taco.

17:42.892 --> 17:45.060
Why is Leonard
softly banging his head

17:45.127 --> 17:47.195
against his bedroom door?

17:47.263 --> 17:52.101
Speaking of warm feelings--
come here.

18:01.279 --> 18:04.382
No, I'd rather have
the busboy.

18:12.426 --> 18:14.794
Thank you for taking me
to the airport.

18:14.862 --> 18:16.429
You're very welcome.

18:16.497 --> 18:19.499
Once again,
I'm driving.

18:19.567 --> 18:20.834
I'm right here.

18:20.901 --> 18:23.370
Please, I am very hungover

18:23.437 --> 18:27.040
and in no mood to satisfy
your need for approval.

18:28.176 --> 18:30.010
Sheldon, I do hope
you'll forgive me

18:30.078 --> 18:32.245
for my inappropriate
behavior last night.

18:32.313 --> 18:33.380
I don't blame you.

18:33.447 --> 18:34.948
You were intoxicated.

18:35.016 --> 18:36.316
Thank you.

18:36.384 --> 18:37.617
I blame Penny.

18:37.685 --> 18:39.819
I blame Penny, too.

18:39.887 --> 18:42.588
Bad Penny.

18:42.656 --> 18:44.958
Wait a minute,
what are you talking about?

18:45.025 --> 18:46.359
What inappropriate behavior?

18:46.427 --> 18:49.462
I think it's best
that you not know.

18:49.530 --> 18:51.364
Agreed.
Agreed.

18:51.432 --> 18:55.068
What the hell... agreed.

18:55.136 --> 18:58.537
And I want you to take very
good care of this young woman.

18:58.605 --> 19:00.973
Oh, thank you, Beverly.

19:01.041 --> 19:02.541
You're welcome.

19:02.609 --> 19:05.211
She doesn't have much
in the way of career prospects.

19:05.279 --> 19:08.280
Don't make her responsible
for her own orgasms as well.

19:12.218 --> 19:13.818
Mother, remember
when I was complaining

19:13.886 --> 19:15.120
that you don't communicate
with me enough?

19:15.187 --> 19:18.590
Yes, dear.
- I'm over it.
