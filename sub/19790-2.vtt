00:05.670 --> 00:08.000
Uck! I hate Valentine's Day.

00:08.000 --> 00:10.170
Why? Oh...

00:10.170 --> 00:11.330
because of your life.

00:14.330 --> 00:15.380
What are you looking for?

00:15.380 --> 00:16.790
Flowers from Kendrick's,

00:16.790 --> 00:18.120
chocolates from an ex,

00:18.120 --> 00:20.670
a poem from the homeless guy
who sleeps on the fire escape--

00:20.670 --> 00:22.620
anything, I'm desperate.

00:22.620 --> 00:25.330
Well, they're not from a man,

00:25.330 --> 00:27.620
but guess who did
get you chocolates?

00:27.620 --> 00:29.960
-You?
-Yes!

00:29.960 --> 00:31.750
C'mon, cheer up, sunshine!

00:31.750 --> 00:33.290
Valentine's Day can
never be that bad,

00:33.290 --> 00:35.120
because we'll always
have each other.

00:35.120 --> 00:36.380
And stop smiling, okay?

00:36.380 --> 00:38.500
You're just happy
because you have
a man in your life.

00:38.500 --> 00:40.620
I do not have
a man in my life,

00:40.620 --> 00:42.880
I have a Josh,
and we have a strictly

00:42.880 --> 00:44.380
punch-card relationship.

00:44.380 --> 00:45.580
Hmm...

00:45.580 --> 00:47.580
you guys aren't going to do
anything romantic tonight?

00:47.580 --> 00:49.750
That's right!
People get crazy
on Valentine's Day,

00:49.750 --> 00:51.920
and because we're not a couple,
we're not going to celebrate it.

00:51.920 --> 00:54.460
No gifts,
no romance, no mush.

00:54.460 --> 00:55.960
What's up with your box?

00:55.960 --> 00:58.830
(scoffs)
My box is not going
anywhere near Josh--

00:58.830 --> 01:00.170
Oh, this box.

01:01.420 --> 01:05.120
Well, Alan asked me to make
a surprise dinner for Elliot,

01:05.120 --> 01:07.120
and, me, I am looking
forward to spending

01:07.120 --> 01:09.170
a booze-filled night
with you and Yolanda,

01:09.170 --> 01:10.580
my gal-entines.

01:11.580 --> 01:13.710
Uck.

01:13.710 --> 01:15.420
Where the hell
have you guys been?

01:15.420 --> 01:17.540
We were supposed
to start drinking at 9:00.

01:17.540 --> 01:18.580
P.M.

01:20.460 --> 01:22.420
Oh my damn!

01:22.420 --> 01:24.000
I'm gonna need
a ride to work.

My pleasure, Alan.
Elliot's gonna love it.

01:48.880 --> 01:51.580
It's super cute. It's got
all your favorite foods in it.

01:51.580 --> 01:54.830
I call it, "Eat, Gay, Love."

01:54.830 --> 01:55.960
-Isn't that fun--
-(line clicks)

01:55.960 --> 01:57.210
Hello?

01:58.580 --> 01:59.620
What you got there?

01:59.620 --> 02:00.960
Um, nothing.

02:00.960 --> 02:02.620
-It looks like a gift.
-Why would you say that?

02:02.620 --> 02:04.210
'Cause it's a box
with a big bow on it.

02:04.210 --> 02:05.960
Who's it for? Spill it!

02:05.960 --> 02:09.120
Um, huh, Josh, it's--
it's for Josh.

02:09.120 --> 02:11.790
It's a little Valentine's Day
gift that I got for him,

02:11.790 --> 02:13.880
but don't tell him.
It'll ruin everything.

02:13.880 --> 02:16.250
Please, I can keep a secret.

02:16.250 --> 02:18.000
Just ask my high school
tennis coach.

02:20.290 --> 02:21.960
Hey, did Gabi leave
for the grocery store yet?

02:21.960 --> 02:23.540
Fine, I'll tell you.

02:25.120 --> 02:27.120
Gabi has a Valentine's Day
gift for you.

02:27.120 --> 02:29.120
(snickers)
What? No, she doesn't.

02:29.120 --> 02:31.330
She's in the laundry room
right now hiding it.

02:31.330 --> 02:34.210
See, that's why
my tennis coach got fired.

02:35.210 --> 02:36.670
Wait, we had an agreement.

02:36.670 --> 02:38.330
No gifts, no romance, no mush.

02:39.330 --> 02:40.790
Dammit, I knew this was
going to happen.

02:40.790 --> 02:42.330
See?

02:42.330 --> 02:44.290
I knew the minute
we were having
the sex

02:44.290 --> 02:45.620
she wouldn't be
able to resist me.

02:46.920 --> 02:48.000
Now what am I going to do?

02:48.000 --> 02:50.170
Just don't get her
anything in return.

02:50.170 --> 02:52.290
Are you out of your mind?

02:52.290 --> 02:53.920
I can't not get her anything.

02:53.920 --> 02:55.000
Do you know nothing about women?

02:56.120 --> 02:57.460
Did we just meet?

02:58.880 --> 03:00.670
If Gabi gets me a gift
and I don't get her one

03:00.670 --> 03:01.920
she'll be all hurt, and then

03:01.920 --> 03:03.540
that'll turn to resentment.

03:03.540 --> 03:05.670
That could be the end
of the punch-card relationship,

03:05.670 --> 03:07.710
or maybe our whole relationship.

03:07.710 --> 03:10.420
(scoffs) Thank god Alan
and I don't have

03:10.420 --> 03:11.540
to get
each other gifts.

03:11.540 --> 03:13.540
That's the benefit
of being married.

03:13.540 --> 03:16.120
Hello, commitment.
Goodbye, effort.

03:17.170 --> 03:18.500
Seriously, what am I
going to get her?

03:18.500 --> 03:19.960
It's already Valentine's Day.

03:19.960 --> 03:23.290
I'd give you my reservations
to Alan's favorite restaurant,

03:23.290 --> 03:24.790
La Lune Jaune,

03:24.790 --> 03:26.040
but I didn't make any,

03:26.040 --> 03:29.420
because I'm married
and I put in zero effort.

03:31.170 --> 03:32.460
Hey, Josh, I was--

03:32.460 --> 03:34.960
-I got you a gift.
-What?

03:34.960 --> 03:36.620
Yup, I got you a gift.

03:36.620 --> 03:38.380
Okay, but I thought
we said no gifts.

03:38.380 --> 03:39.710
Ah, yeah, I know
we said no gifts,

03:39.710 --> 03:41.960
but sometimes you say you're
not going to get someone a gift

03:41.960 --> 03:42.960
and you get them one anyway,

03:42.960 --> 03:45.290
which is why I got you a--

03:45.290 --> 03:46.790
I got you

03:46.790 --> 03:48.620
a dinner
at La La Lu Jaune.

03:49.670 --> 03:52.330
Ahh, wow, what a surprise!

03:52.330 --> 03:54.170
Um, I mean,
I had plans

03:54.170 --> 03:55.920
with Yolanda and Sofia,

03:55.920 --> 03:57.540
but I'll just call Sofia
right now

03:57.540 --> 03:59.500
(whispers)
so she can tell me
what to do!

04:04.460 --> 04:06.080
What?
I thought you guys said

04:06.080 --> 04:07.380
you weren't getting
each other gifts.

04:07.380 --> 04:09.540
Yeah I know, but he crumbled
and asked me out to dinner.

04:09.540 --> 04:11.750
A romantic dinner. God.

04:11.750 --> 04:12.960
I knew once
we were having sex

04:12.960 --> 04:14.210
he wouldn't be able
to resist me.

04:15.790 --> 04:17.250
Aw, you poor bitch.

04:17.250 --> 04:19.710
Sofia, what are we gonna do?

04:19.710 --> 04:20.830
Don't go.

04:20.830 --> 04:22.250
I can't not go.

04:22.250 --> 04:24.750
He'll fell rejected
which will turn to hurt,

04:24.750 --> 04:26.080
which he'll cover
with sarcasm,

04:26.080 --> 04:27.710
which is really just anger,
and after anger

04:27.710 --> 04:28.920
there's no turning back.

04:28.920 --> 04:31.920
Our very complicated simply
sex relationship will be over!

04:32.920 --> 04:34.210
Okay, so then go,

04:34.210 --> 04:36.210
but if he does
anything romantic,

04:36.210 --> 04:38.210
just shut it down.
Make it clear that romance

04:38.210 --> 04:40.330
is the last thing that you want
on Valentine's Day.

04:40.330 --> 04:44.710
Wow, Sofia, you are so good
at getting guys not to love you.

04:44.710 --> 04:47.290
Okay, well, good luck!
(clears throat)

04:47.290 --> 04:48.620
Well, Yolanda,

04:48.620 --> 04:50.250
looks like it's just
you and me tonight.

04:50.250 --> 04:52.670
(chuckles)
That'll be fun too.

04:54.500 --> 04:55.880
What the hell was that look?

04:55.880 --> 04:57.880
Let's be real,

04:57.880 --> 05:00.250
of the two of you,
Gabi is the fun one.

05:00.250 --> 05:02.540
I'm fun!

05:02.540 --> 05:04.830
What, did you think looking
for continuity errors

05:04.830 --> 05:07.830
in Downton Abbey was all
I had planned for tonight?

05:08.920 --> 05:11.420
What else?
We gonna order some pizza?

05:11.420 --> 05:14.540
With all kinds of super fun
and unique toppings!

05:15.750 --> 05:18.120
How 'bout we order something
with no toppings,

05:18.120 --> 05:19.500
like a stripper?

05:19.500 --> 05:21.750
What do you mean?

05:21.750 --> 05:23.170
Like a man stripper?

05:24.670 --> 05:26.670
Who said you're not fun?

05:26.670 --> 05:28.830
I got him on speed dial.

05:34.120 --> 05:36.620
(soft piano music playing)

05:36.620 --> 05:37.670
Wow,

05:37.670 --> 05:40.670
a lot of candlelight and romance
here on Valentine's Day.

05:41.750 --> 05:43.620
And it is packed!

05:43.620 --> 05:46.120
That's not good... for...

05:46.120 --> 05:47.670
those losers who didn't
make a reservation.

05:47.670 --> 05:48.670
Gimme a second.

05:50.080 --> 05:52.170
No, I am sorry,
it is Valentine's Day,

05:52.170 --> 05:53.580
the Christmas of love.

05:53.580 --> 05:55.080
We are booked solid.

05:55.080 --> 05:57.460
No amount of money
will get you a table.

05:57.460 --> 05:59.120
Please call again anytime.

06:01.170 --> 06:03.920
Ah, monsieur,
you have a reservation?

06:03.920 --> 06:05.960
I do. I'm Michael Stein,
and I'm right here,

06:05.960 --> 06:07.380
and right there.

06:07.380 --> 06:09.120
You're Michael Stein?

06:10.120 --> 06:11.670
Doctor, it is only 7:30.

06:11.670 --> 06:12.670
You're half an hour early.

06:13.960 --> 06:15.540
Ah, yeah, ah...

06:15.540 --> 06:18.290
I have a really good
reason for that, um...

06:18.290 --> 06:19.380
I'm a doctor,

06:19.380 --> 06:20.830
ah, tonight I'm
performing surgery.

06:20.830 --> 06:22.710
I'm separating conjoined twins,
they're sharing a heart

06:22.710 --> 06:24.250
which is funny 'cause
it's Valentine's Day.

06:24.250 --> 06:27.540
Anyhoo, I need to be
out of here by 8:00.

06:27.540 --> 06:29.380
Very well,
right this way.

06:29.380 --> 06:31.460
Tonight we serve
a prefixed menu

06:31.460 --> 06:32.830
consisting
of seven courses.

06:32.830 --> 06:34.710
Hey, you know what, chief,
why don't we just, ah,

06:34.710 --> 06:36.380
mush them all together.
They're all French, right?

06:38.080 --> 06:39.120
Very well.

06:39.120 --> 06:41.250
Do you have any requests
for the pianist?

06:41.250 --> 06:43.250
Oh, no. I am definitely
not in the mood

06:43.250 --> 06:44.290
for any pianist tonight.

06:49.210 --> 06:50.830
Surprise!

06:50.830 --> 06:53.420
What the hell's this?

06:53.420 --> 06:55.710
I wanted to have our first
Valentine's Day dinner

06:55.710 --> 06:56.960
where we had
our first date,

06:56.960 --> 06:58.290
on Josh's terrace.

06:58.290 --> 07:00.380
Why do you have
Gabi's gift for Josh?

07:00.380 --> 07:02.420
It's not!
That's my gift for you.

07:02.420 --> 07:04.330
I had Gabi make
a romantic dinner for us

07:04.330 --> 07:05.960
and put it in this box.

07:05.960 --> 07:09.040
Wait so, you got me
a Valentine's Day gift?

07:09.040 --> 07:10.920
Of course.
People in love

07:10.920 --> 07:13.750
get people they love gifts.
We're not animals.

07:13.750 --> 07:15.250
I can't wait to see
what you got me.

07:15.250 --> 07:17.500
Well, you're gonna
have to wait a little longer.

07:17.500 --> 07:20.250
-How much?
-'Till the stores
open tomorrow.

07:20.250 --> 07:22.330
What? You didn't
get me a gift?

07:22.330 --> 07:24.790
I thought
we said no gifts!

07:24.790 --> 07:26.210
We never said that!

07:26.210 --> 07:28.040
Well, we should have.

07:28.040 --> 07:29.620
I mean,
this is ridiculous.

07:29.620 --> 07:32.080
We don't have to be
romantic anymore.

07:32.080 --> 07:33.250
We're married.

07:34.540 --> 07:35.580
Are we?

07:36.580 --> 07:37.960
Alan!

07:41.040 --> 07:43.330
Oh, "Eat, Gay, Love."
That's clever.

07:49.500 --> 07:51.580
Ugh.

07:51.580 --> 07:54.880
I can't believe we just ate a
seven-course meal in 15 minutes.

07:54.880 --> 07:56.620
22 minutes.
I can't eat another thing!

07:56.620 --> 07:58.210
Dessert, please.

07:59.330 --> 08:01.290
You're ready for... it?

08:02.500 --> 08:04.210
Now?

08:04.210 --> 08:05.330
Yes. Bring it. Bring everything.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.620
Okay, what is going on?

08:08.620 --> 08:09.880
I mean, you're rushing
through dinner.

08:09.880 --> 08:10.920
You keep checking your watch.

08:10.920 --> 08:12.170
Why are you acting so weird?

08:12.170 --> 08:13.500
Look, I need
to tell you the truth.

08:14.830 --> 08:16.210
The truth about what?

08:16.210 --> 08:18.330
Why I brought you to this

08:18.330 --> 08:20.710
unbelievably romantic restaurant
on Valentine's Day.

08:20.710 --> 08:22.330
Uh...

08:22.330 --> 08:24.000
did you get a haircut?

08:25.000 --> 08:26.920
Look, our relationship
is very important to me.

08:26.920 --> 08:29.000
Because maybe you did,
but maybe it's just
a product.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.420
And it's scary
because what I'm about
to say could change that.

08:31.420 --> 08:34.460
'Cause it's really,
it's flattened out the sides,
you know?

08:34.460 --> 08:37.380
-Gabi, I--
-Oh gosh, I'm so sorry.

08:37.380 --> 08:38.670
That's okay, you missed.

08:38.670 --> 08:39.830
Oh, I did? Lemme see.

08:39.830 --> 08:42.460
Oh my gosh! So sorry!

08:42.460 --> 08:44.580
-Oh!
-Excuse me.

08:46.380 --> 08:49.120
♪ La da da da,
da da da da da ♪

08:49.120 --> 08:50.750
Oh! No, no, no.

08:50.750 --> 08:52.960
The last thing we need
right now is champagne.

08:52.960 --> 08:55.120
Oh, but this is very
special champagne.

08:55.120 --> 08:58.670
-Monsieur picked it out himself.
-Oh, I'm sure the "mon-siur" did

08:58.670 --> 09:01.790
but the "mon-siur" is acting a
little nutso on Valentine's Day,

09:01.790 --> 09:04.460
so I think we need to pump
the "mon-siur's" brakes!

09:04.460 --> 09:07.540
-It's $1,500 a bottle.
-One sip can't hurt.

09:09.420 --> 09:11.250
No, no, no, no, no!
Not yet!

09:13.830 --> 09:15.120
What the hell?
A ring?

09:15.120 --> 09:17.380
Yes, you have to wait
for monsieur!

09:17.380 --> 09:19.040
For what?

09:19.040 --> 09:21.620
For your engagement.
Congratulations by the way.

09:22.790 --> 09:24.420
Yeah, just spit it back in.

09:24.420 --> 09:26.380
We can reenact it
when monsieur comes back.

09:26.380 --> 09:29.080
No, no, no, no.
I'm not reenacting anything.

09:29.080 --> 09:30.080
I gotta get out of here.

09:37.920 --> 09:39.580
Ah, Dr. Stein.

09:39.580 --> 09:42.250
Forgive me, but your
proposal to mademoiselle

09:42.250 --> 09:43.620
did not go
exactly as planned.

09:44.620 --> 09:46.290
My what now?

09:46.290 --> 09:48.460
We put the ring
in the champagne

09:48.460 --> 09:50.290
just like your
assistant requested,

09:50.290 --> 09:51.830
but when mademoiselle saw it,

09:51.830 --> 09:53.920
sadly, she run away.

09:54.920 --> 09:56.330
What? No, no.

09:56.330 --> 09:58.540
I didn't propose.
We're just friends.

09:58.540 --> 10:00.040
Yes, well, now you are.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.540
-(knock on door)
-Stripper's here!

10:09.380 --> 10:12.080
Both:
Hey! Oh...

10:12.080 --> 10:14.040
Elliot and I
had a horrible fight.

10:14.040 --> 10:15.250
I didn't know
where else to go.

10:15.250 --> 10:16.830
Oh, I'm sorry, Alan.

10:16.830 --> 10:18.620
Thanks, but there's nothing
you could possibly say

10:18.620 --> 10:20.040
to cheer me up right now.

10:20.040 --> 10:22.710
-We got a male stripper coming.
-Except that.

10:22.710 --> 10:23.880
(knock on door)

10:23.880 --> 10:25.880
Ooh! Stripper's here!

10:26.960 --> 10:29.880
Trio:
Hey! Oh...

10:29.880 --> 10:31.460
I forgot my keys.

10:31.460 --> 10:33.290
Gabi, what's wrong?
I thought you were
supposed to be

10:33.290 --> 10:34.620
at your unromantic dinner
with Josh.

10:34.620 --> 10:36.540
Oh, yeah.
It was unromantic,

10:36.540 --> 10:37.620
until he proposed!

10:37.620 --> 10:39.500
-What?
-Oy. Don't do it, Gabi.

10:39.500 --> 10:40.710
Pat Benatar was right.

10:40.710 --> 10:42.790
Love is a battlefield.

10:43.960 --> 10:46.040
Hold up. Josh wouldn't make
a decision like this

10:46.040 --> 10:47.080
without talking to me.

10:47.080 --> 10:50.170
If he was gonna
propose to you, I'd know it.

10:50.170 --> 10:52.710
Ooh, congratulations, girl!

10:52.710 --> 10:54.500
-(knock on door)
-Stripper's here!

10:54.500 --> 10:56.920
-Josh:
Gabi, are you in there?
-Dammit!

10:56.920 --> 10:59.460
(whispers)
My god, it's Josh.

10:59.460 --> 11:01.620
I don't want to talk to him.
I was never here.

11:09.830 --> 11:11.580
Where's the rest
of the fire escape?

11:12.960 --> 11:15.120
Thank god there's not
an actual fire.

11:17.040 --> 11:19.080
Mm.

11:26.540 --> 11:29.120
-I'm calling the cops!
-No, no, no, please.

11:30.960 --> 11:32.460
Oh no, hold still.

11:34.290 --> 11:36.920
I know I've got a gun
around here someplace.

11:37.960 --> 11:39.750
I'm sorry. Is tonight
your wedding night?

11:40.880 --> 11:42.120
Why would you think that?

11:43.790 --> 11:45.120
No reason.

11:45.120 --> 11:47.120
Um, so, I'm Gabi.

11:47.120 --> 11:49.210
I'm your upstairs
neighbor, and uh,

11:49.210 --> 11:50.830
I'm only here because...

11:50.830 --> 11:52.960
the guy that I was
having casual sex with just

11:52.960 --> 11:54.670
proposed and I don't
wanna marry him.

11:54.670 --> 11:56.290
So I ran away
and now he's upstairs.

11:57.460 --> 11:58.960
Did I ask?

12:01.960 --> 12:04.420
Are you sure there's
nobody else here like--

12:04.420 --> 12:05.670
like a groom?

12:05.670 --> 12:08.080
Why do you keep asking that?

12:08.080 --> 12:10.000
There's no one else here,

12:10.000 --> 12:11.960
including the delivery guy

12:11.960 --> 12:13.580
with my calzone.

12:14.790 --> 12:17.710
Um, hey well, maybe we can
help each other out.

12:17.710 --> 12:19.960
I'm a chef, and if you
don't call the cops,

12:19.960 --> 12:21.380
I will make you
something amazing!

12:21.380 --> 12:24.620
Throw in rotating my mattress,
you got a deal.

12:30.420 --> 12:32.580
You have to
give me a reservation.

12:32.580 --> 12:34.880
This is my husband's
favorite restaurant.

12:34.880 --> 12:36.500
-I'll do anything!
-Please, sir.

12:36.500 --> 12:37.960
I don't have time
for this right now.

12:37.960 --> 12:41.250
My piano player just left
with the food poisoning--

12:41.250 --> 12:42.670
I mean the flu.

12:43.670 --> 12:46.500
I can play piano,
but in return,

12:46.500 --> 12:47.830
you have to give me a table.

12:47.830 --> 12:49.330
-You play piano?
-Yes.

12:49.330 --> 12:51.120
My mother wouldn't
let me eat dessert

12:51.120 --> 12:52.460
unless I practiced.

12:52.460 --> 12:54.330
Then you must be
a virtuoso.

12:55.750 --> 12:58.040
All right,
hit it, Gay-thoven.

13:02.420 --> 13:04.880
Well, you were right. Once I

13:04.880 --> 13:07.210
hammered off all the
freezer ice, it was a brisket.

13:08.540 --> 13:11.210
Oh, expires 2003.

13:11.210 --> 13:12.580
So did Harry.

13:14.580 --> 13:16.170
Was Harry your husband?

13:17.330 --> 13:18.790
No, it was the cow.

13:20.670 --> 13:22.460
You're a natural blonde,
aren't you?

13:26.460 --> 13:29.000
So, uh, I just gotta ask.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.170
Why are you wearing
a wedding dress?

13:31.170 --> 13:34.080
I wear it every Valentine's Day.

13:36.210 --> 13:37.880
It is Valentine's Day, right?

13:39.170 --> 13:40.460
Yeah.

13:40.460 --> 13:43.620
Okay, let's see. This carrot
will add some color.

13:43.620 --> 13:44.920
Ooh.

13:44.920 --> 13:46.620
Reminds me of Charlie...

13:48.170 --> 13:50.290
my fourth husband,

13:50.290 --> 13:52.330
which is why I married Harry,

13:52.330 --> 13:53.330
my fifth.

13:55.120 --> 13:57.670
Wow, you've been
married five times?

13:57.670 --> 14:00.000
I ran away at the thought
of just one.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.250
You must really love
being married.

14:01.250 --> 14:02.460
No.

14:04.170 --> 14:06.500
Well then, why would
you do it five times?

14:06.500 --> 14:08.210
I love wearing the dress.

14:09.670 --> 14:12.620
Plus, when you are in it,

14:12.620 --> 14:14.710
something magical happens.

14:14.710 --> 14:17.460
I thought that only happened
when you took the dress off.

14:18.500 --> 14:20.080
Don't be dirty.

14:21.960 --> 14:23.210
Sorry.

14:23.210 --> 14:25.960
I would've been
married seven times.

14:25.960 --> 14:28.460
but twice, I put it on,

14:28.460 --> 14:32.290
and it told me, "Don't do it."

14:32.290 --> 14:33.670
Wow, so...

14:33.670 --> 14:36.210
the dress actually
told you that?

14:36.210 --> 14:39.960
Oh, put it on, it answers
all of your questions.

14:42.620 --> 14:44.460
You wanna try it on, don't you?

14:46.830 --> 14:48.710
Well, I do have
a lot of questions.

14:48.710 --> 14:50.790
Okay,

14:50.790 --> 14:53.170
but you're not going
to fill it out like I do.

14:57.080 --> 14:58.880
You're telling me that
Valentine's gift

14:58.880 --> 15:00.380
-wasn't from Gabi?
-No.

15:00.380 --> 15:03.420
It was my gift to Elliot,
who won't stop calling.

15:03.420 --> 15:05.830
But I refuse to answer
because that gift,

15:05.830 --> 15:07.670
was from my heart,
which I no longer have

15:07.670 --> 15:10.250
because my ice queen
husband ripped it from my chest

15:10.250 --> 15:11.710
on the most romantic
day of the year!

15:11.710 --> 15:12.750
Where's that damn stripper?

15:14.750 --> 15:16.210
The only reason I took
her out was because

15:16.210 --> 15:17.670
I thought
she got me something.

15:17.670 --> 15:19.120
I didn't want
to hurt her feelings.

15:19.120 --> 15:20.420
The only reason
she went with you is

15:20.420 --> 15:22.000
because she didn't want
to hurt your feelings.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.960
And then
she thought you proposed,
and she freaked out!

15:23.960 --> 15:26.250
No! No, no, no...
this doesn't make sense, okay?

15:26.250 --> 15:27.580
I know Gabi.

15:27.580 --> 15:29.250
She's never had
a problem saying no.

15:29.250 --> 15:30.710
Want to know what I think?

15:30.710 --> 15:32.380
I think she does have
feelings for me,

15:32.380 --> 15:34.040
and she's conflicted!

15:34.040 --> 15:36.790
-She's not conflicted.
-Gabi: Oh my god!

15:36.790 --> 15:38.040
Gabi?

15:40.210 --> 15:42.250
So, was I right?

15:42.250 --> 15:45.580
Yep, I do not fill it out
the way you do,

15:45.580 --> 15:47.790
but I love it.
I love it so much.

15:53.210 --> 15:54.880
She's in a dress!

15:54.880 --> 15:57.000
-She's in a wedding dress!
-Who?

15:57.000 --> 15:59.250
Gabi, she's in a wedding dress,
a big one with-- with--

15:59.250 --> 16:00.830
with the frills,
and it has the poof.

16:00.830 --> 16:03.540
-What are you talking about?
-I was wrong, Sofia.

16:03.540 --> 16:04.960
She's not conflicted.

16:04.960 --> 16:06.120
She freaking loves me.

16:08.330 --> 16:09.710
I don't ever
want to take it off.

16:09.710 --> 16:11.960
But that's when the fun starts.

16:13.210 --> 16:14.290
Don't be dirty.

16:16.080 --> 16:17.120
Ahh!

16:17.120 --> 16:18.790
-Oh my god!
-Pretty!

16:18.790 --> 16:19.960
Did I just hear
the stripper?

16:19.960 --> 16:21.830
What are you guys
doing down here?

16:21.830 --> 16:23.330
Looking for you,
sweetheart!

16:23.330 --> 16:25.210
This is the guy
you ran away from?

16:27.120 --> 16:29.170
(whispers)
Newsflash, gay.

16:32.330 --> 16:34.830
No, not him. Him!

16:35.960 --> 16:39.040
Ooh... nice!

16:41.170 --> 16:43.330
Gabi, I don't want
to marry you.

16:43.330 --> 16:45.040
-You don't?
-No!

16:45.040 --> 16:46.380
Well, then why did
you propose to me?

16:46.380 --> 16:47.670
I didn't propose.

16:47.670 --> 16:48.880
Michael Stein proposed.

16:48.880 --> 16:50.170
Who the hell
is Michael Stein?

16:50.170 --> 16:51.830
The guy whose reservation
I stole because I thought

16:51.830 --> 16:53.250
you got me a gift,
but it turns out it was

16:53.250 --> 16:54.380
Alan's gift to Elliot.

16:54.380 --> 16:55.710
Can't hear that enough.

16:57.120 --> 16:58.620
Wait, so seriously you

16:58.620 --> 17:00.420
-don't wanna marry me?
-No.

17:00.420 --> 17:01.880
I'll marry you.

17:04.080 --> 17:06.420
Gabi, I love the way things
are between us right now.

17:06.420 --> 17:08.620
I do too. I mean,
I don't wanna marry you.

17:08.620 --> 17:10.120
I don't even know why
I'm wearing this ring.

17:10.120 --> 17:12.460
Ring? You kept the ri--
you kept the ring?

17:14.460 --> 17:15.500
(phone rings)

17:15.500 --> 17:17.120
Hello, La Lune Jaune.

17:17.120 --> 17:18.500
Hi, uh,

17:18.500 --> 17:19.960
not sure if you're going
to remember me,

17:19.960 --> 17:22.210
but I'm the guy
who came in earlier
pretending to be Michael Stein?

17:22.210 --> 17:24.080
Oh, thank god,
please tell me
you are calling

17:24.080 --> 17:25.250
because you have the ring.

17:25.250 --> 17:26.750
Yes, we have it
right here.

17:26.750 --> 17:28.880
Hurry, because the future
Mr. and Mrs. Stein

17:28.880 --> 17:30.790
are ten minutes away
from the champagne course.

17:30.790 --> 17:33.210
Ah, okay, we're on our way!

17:33.210 --> 17:34.790
Take off the ring.

17:34.790 --> 17:37.000
Yeah, I'm trying but someone
just force-fed me

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
a seven-course meal and I'm
a little bloated.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.620
You'll get it off
in the car.

17:40.620 --> 17:42.170
-Guys, pull my car around?
-Ah.

17:42.170 --> 17:44.290
Okay, lemme just--
lemme go change and I'll

17:44.290 --> 17:46.710
-put on my shoes. (screams)
-No time, no time. No time!

17:48.330 --> 17:50.500
I gotta start locking
my window.

17:56.750 --> 17:58.460
We're here, we're here.

17:59.920 --> 18:01.500
Wow, I thought she said no?

18:01.500 --> 18:04.170
We've got the ring.
We've got the ring.

18:04.170 --> 18:05.790
We stalled
as long as we could.

18:05.790 --> 18:07.420
They're about to serve
the champagne right now.

18:07.420 --> 18:09.710
-Take off the ring.
-Yeah, I'm trying.
It's stuck on my knuckle.

18:09.710 --> 18:11.290
-Keep pulling.
-I am pulling.

18:11.290 --> 18:13.790
It won't come off!
Ooh, melted butter.

18:16.710 --> 18:18.290
You can take it
to the table now.
Thank you.

18:20.170 --> 18:22.830
(grunts)
Oh no!

18:26.500 --> 18:29.210
Ooh, champagne course.

18:29.210 --> 18:30.750
So fancy!

18:35.330 --> 18:38.210
Oh my god. I will!

18:38.210 --> 18:39.920
All:
She will!

18:41.790 --> 18:43.540
Hey, they're getting married!

18:43.540 --> 18:45.210
Hey, we're not!

18:45.210 --> 18:47.120
Oh. I'm Yolanda.

18:47.120 --> 18:48.540
I get off
in ten minutes.

18:48.540 --> 18:51.290
God willing, I will too.

18:53.040 --> 18:56.380
I'm glad someone's having
a nice Valentine's day.

18:56.380 --> 18:58.670
-Alan?
-Elliot.

18:58.670 --> 19:01.170
