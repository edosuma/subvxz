<i>Previously on</i> The Vampire Diaries:

00:03.870 --> 00:05.895
- You must be Elena.
- How do we look alike?

00:06.072 --> 00:08.768
You're a Petrova doppelganger.
Key to breaking the curse.

00:08.942 --> 00:10.842
- Sun and the moon curse?
- Klaus is real.

00:11.011 --> 00:12.273
First generation vampire.

00:12.445 --> 00:15.141
The oldest vampire in the history
of time is after me?

00:15.315 --> 00:17.078
Elijah. He's one of the Originals.

00:17.250 --> 00:18.740
I'm prepared to offer a deal.

00:18.918 --> 00:22.081
- What kind of a deal?
- We'll draw Klaus out, I'll make certain...

00:22.255 --> 00:24.018
...your friends are unharmed.
- Then?

00:24.190 --> 00:25.885
- I kill him.
- I come bearing gifts.

00:26.159 --> 00:28.457
This is how you kill an Original.

00:28.628 --> 00:31.927
Killing Elijah would be a
suicide mission. You can't do it.

00:32.131 --> 00:33.793
Even with the dagger and white ash?

00:34.000 --> 00:37.265
If you kill Elijah,
then I'm stuck in here forever.

00:39.839 --> 00:42.307
As long as we keep
the dagger there, he stays dead.

00:42.509 --> 00:44.602
- Pretty much.
- How did you get out?

00:44.778 --> 00:48.646
I knew that if I begged you not to kill
Elijah that's exactly what you'd do.

00:48.815 --> 00:51.511
As soon as Originals die,
compulsion wears off.

00:51.684 --> 00:53.675
What did Luka tell you?

00:53.853 --> 00:56.720
He told me about your daughter.
I know Klaus has her.

00:56.956 --> 00:59.288
I want to help you get her back.
Please.

01:00.427 --> 01:01.894
No.

01:02.062 --> 01:03.620
He took my powers.

01:09.436 --> 01:11.666
Stefan, we're late for school.

01:11.838 --> 01:13.897
- Let's be later.
- Stefan, it's school.

01:14.074 --> 01:15.735
That thing we're forgetting about?

01:15.942 --> 01:17.569
- Hey.
- School?

01:17.744 --> 01:18.733
Heh, mm-mm.

01:19.746 --> 01:23.011
- Doesn't ring a bell.
- Stefan.

01:23.216 --> 01:24.581
Stefan. Okay, five minutes.

01:24.751 --> 01:27.481
- Only five minutes.
- Five minutes?

01:34.694 --> 01:36.491
Good morning, Damon.

01:40.366 --> 01:41.560
What are you doing here?

01:41.734 --> 01:43.725
- What is your problem?
- Wear her clothes?

01:43.903 --> 01:45.894
Like that's going to work.

01:46.072 --> 01:47.869
You think I'm Katherine?

01:48.041 --> 01:50.566
Why would you think that?
Katherine's in a tomb.

01:52.112 --> 01:53.875
Isn't she?

01:57.684 --> 01:59.584
What the hell's going on here?

02:00.386 --> 02:04.083
I don't know, you tell me.
Is Katherine in the tomb or not?

02:09.628 --> 02:11.722
- What are you doing?
- How could you do this?

02:11.898 --> 02:14.196
- Stefan, you're hurting me. Aah!
- Stop it, Katherine.

02:14.367 --> 02:16.232
Stop what?

02:19.906 --> 02:22.602
It's getting really easy being you.

02:33.720 --> 02:36.086
- What is she doing here?
- When we killed Elijah...

02:36.256 --> 02:38.087
...it broke the compulsion, freed her.

02:38.258 --> 02:40.021
- How's that possible?
- He's Original.

02:40.193 --> 02:42.388
They have all sorts of special skills.

02:42.595 --> 02:45.564
I don't want you here.
Get her out of here.

02:45.732 --> 02:48.292
You need me, Elena. You all do.

02:48.501 --> 02:50.731
- Like hell.
- We all want the same thing:

02:50.904 --> 02:53.031
Klaus dead. Yet here you all are...

02:53.206 --> 02:55.731
...running like chickens
with their heads cut off.

02:55.909 --> 02:58.639
I don't need your help
and I don't want it.

02:58.878 --> 03:00.709
And that's incredibly stupid of you.

03:01.147 --> 03:02.808
Do you know where Klaus is?

03:03.016 --> 03:05.382
When he's coming,
what he looks like?

03:05.752 --> 03:08.550
If you know something,
say it or get out.

03:08.721 --> 03:11.315
Fine. Then I'll just go to the Grill...

03:11.524 --> 03:14.755
...and have some lunch, maybe
Aunt Jenna's free for a bite.

03:17.830 --> 03:20.060
- Hey, Matt.
- Hey.

03:20.233 --> 03:22.667
- Live band?
- Yeah, business has been a little slow.

03:22.835 --> 03:24.894
The Grill's trying to stay afloat.

03:26.139 --> 03:28.130
Aren't we all? Ha, ha.

03:28.308 --> 03:29.935
Have you heard from Tyler?

03:30.109 --> 03:32.270
Not a peep. You?

03:32.445 --> 03:34.106
Not since he stopped by to talk...

03:34.280 --> 03:36.680
...and I've left messages
on his cell phone.

03:36.849 --> 03:39.943
He stopped by to see you?
What did he say?

03:40.119 --> 03:42.178
Not much, really. I mean...

03:42.355 --> 03:45.188
...I think to say goodbye
without really saying goodbye.

03:45.358 --> 03:48.953
- And I just didn't know it.
- And that's all he said?

03:49.128 --> 03:52.097
Yeah.
Yeah, that's all he said, Caroline.

03:52.265 --> 03:54.859
Why? I mean, is there
something you want to tell me?

03:55.935 --> 03:59.598
Yeah. I... I mean, no, I...

03:59.772 --> 04:02.138
- It's just not that easy.
- I don't get it.

04:02.308 --> 04:05.709
Since when can I express myself
and you're one with a loss for words?

04:05.878 --> 04:07.937
No, you're right, and I'm sorry.

04:08.114 --> 04:10.139
You know how I feel.

04:10.316 --> 04:13.649
So it's your move.
Just make a decision...

04:13.820 --> 04:15.845
...or leave me alone.

04:23.463 --> 04:26.227
Why is she still here? She was free.

04:26.399 --> 04:29.698
She wants what we want, Klaus dead.

04:29.869 --> 04:31.803
Maybe she sees us
as her only chance.

04:31.971 --> 04:34.804
Maybe she's trying to lure you
and Damon back into her web.

04:34.974 --> 04:36.908
- I want her gone.
- So do I.

04:37.110 --> 04:39.374
But you're right, she stayed.

04:39.545 --> 04:41.410
Shouldn't we try to figure out why?

04:41.614 --> 04:43.514
How? All she does is lie.

04:43.683 --> 04:46.675
Look, I hate it as much as you do,
but she does make a point.

04:46.853 --> 04:49.321
We don't know anything
about Klaus. She does.

04:49.489 --> 04:52.925
Right, but that doesn't mean
I want her shacking up with you.

04:53.926 --> 04:55.621
All right.

04:56.996 --> 04:59.089
Maybe we should
stay at your place tonight.

04:59.265 --> 05:01.893
I can't. I told Bonnie and Caroline...

05:02.068 --> 05:04.434
...that they could come over.
Bonnie's freaked...

05:04.637 --> 05:08.869
...because she lost her powers and
Caroline's having Matt drama again.

05:09.342 --> 05:11.367
It's kind of a girls' night.

05:11.944 --> 05:14.344
Maybe Katherine can join us.

05:16.249 --> 05:18.012
Come on.

05:25.925 --> 05:28.655
Ooh. Burning flesh.

05:30.163 --> 05:33.792
If you're trying to get the dagger
you're wasting time. He's indestructible.

05:33.966 --> 05:38.266
No kidding. How do you know
so much about Original vampires?

05:38.438 --> 05:42.568
- Spend 500 years running from one.
- When I told you my plan to kill Elijah...

05:42.742 --> 05:45.905
...why didn't you warn me that I'd die
if I used a dagger on him?

05:46.079 --> 05:49.207
Oh, there's so many rules.
It's all very confusing.

05:50.216 --> 05:53.117
- Did you know I would die?
- Did Elijah tell you his plan?

05:53.286 --> 05:55.186
Did he have a dagger
to kill Klaus with?

05:57.123 --> 05:58.488
Why are you still here?

05:58.691 --> 06:01.091
Because you haven't
forcibly removed me.

06:03.863 --> 06:04.887
You wouldn't.

06:05.064 --> 06:06.326
Oh, I would.

06:08.301 --> 06:10.599
Damon, be smart. I want Klaus dead...

06:10.770 --> 06:13.238
...just as much as you do. More.

06:13.406 --> 06:15.601
If I wasn't being honest
about helping...

06:15.775 --> 06:18.642
...I'd be long gone by now, okay?

06:18.811 --> 06:20.438
You can hate me.

06:20.613 --> 06:22.604
But we want the same thing.

06:22.782 --> 06:24.807
And you know...

06:24.984 --> 06:26.781
...I always get what I want.

06:35.828 --> 06:39.855
I wanted out of the tomb.
Didn't matter who paid the price.

06:40.032 --> 06:41.795
Of course I knew that you'd die.

06:44.036 --> 06:46.869
- She's out of the tomb?
- Yeah. We're dealing with it.

06:47.039 --> 06:49.132
Just be careful.
She's getting too good...

06:49.308 --> 06:51.333
...impersonating Elena.
- With Katherine...

06:51.511 --> 06:54.639
...we gotta find a way
to get your powers back.

06:54.814 --> 06:57.977
I want the Martins on our side.
I want for us to work together...

06:58.151 --> 07:01.643
...now that Elijah's out of the picture.
- It's impossible. They hate us.

07:01.821 --> 07:04.790
It's either win them over or
somebody's going to end up dead.

07:04.957 --> 07:08.757
You think you can at least convince
them to have a civil conversation?

07:09.295 --> 07:11.786
- I'll try.
- Thanks. Keep me posted.

07:11.964 --> 07:14.524
Okay. I gotta get to class.

07:14.767 --> 07:16.564
All right, I'll see you.

07:17.170 --> 07:21.129
Heh. Come on. Elena's nowhere in sight.

07:26.646 --> 07:28.978
I'll tell her soon. I promise.

07:29.315 --> 07:30.577
All right.

07:31.050 --> 07:34.213
It was bad. You know, John planted
all these seeds about Isobel...

07:34.387 --> 07:38.016
...and now Jenna knows I'm lying.
- John's gonna end up dead on the floor.

07:38.191 --> 07:40.182
Yeah, well, easier said than done.

07:40.359 --> 07:43.351
I gave him back his ring. So...

07:43.529 --> 07:45.588
Look, Jenna keeps asking about Isobel.

07:45.798 --> 07:49.598
You know, was she murdered?
Why haven't they found the body?

07:50.236 --> 07:53.069
I mean, how much longer
can she stay in the dark?

07:53.239 --> 07:55.434
You think we should
tell her the truth?

07:55.608 --> 07:57.735
I can't be with her and not tell her.

07:57.910 --> 08:00.208
It's not fair
and not a relationship I want.

08:00.379 --> 08:04.372
Not to mention it's becoming more
dangerous for her not to know.

08:04.550 --> 08:07.883
I thought that we'd hold off
until after we've dealt with Klaus.

08:08.321 --> 08:10.084
You know, and even then...

08:10.723 --> 08:13.590
...how do we tell someone
what we know?

08:13.759 --> 08:15.886
How does someone hear that?

08:16.629 --> 08:18.722
Look, I'm sorry to put this on you.

08:18.898 --> 08:21.196
You know, but I feel
it's your decision to make.

08:21.367 --> 08:24.564
And whatever you decide to do,
I'll respect it.

08:25.238 --> 08:29.368
I want to be honest with her.
But until then...

08:29.542 --> 08:30.975
...Jenna and I are done.

08:34.746 --> 08:37.044
- Thank you for coming.
- I didn't want to.

08:37.216 --> 08:39.946
But my son
made a case to hear you out.

08:40.419 --> 08:43.650
Bonnie said that you have
information about Elijah.

08:44.957 --> 08:47.050
Elijah's dead. I'm sorry.

08:51.497 --> 08:54.557
Hear me out.
We can help you. Please.

08:54.867 --> 08:57.734
We know that Klaus
has your daughter.

08:57.937 --> 09:00.132
Sorry about the way
I got that information...

09:00.306 --> 09:02.399
...but it's good that we know.

09:02.575 --> 09:04.770
We can all work together
to get her back.

09:04.944 --> 09:06.639
- How?
- I suspect you and Elijah...

09:06.812 --> 09:08.803
...had a plan to kill Klaus.

09:08.981 --> 09:11.472
Let us help you carry it out.

09:11.651 --> 09:15.109
You can trust us.
I give you my word. We all do.

09:22.395 --> 09:25.091
- What you up to?
- None of your business.

09:25.765 --> 09:27.130
We're pouting now?

09:27.967 --> 09:29.992
Are those the Gilbert journals?

09:30.202 --> 09:33.501
- "Eighteen sixty-four."
- How am I supposed to help you...

09:33.673 --> 09:36.540
...if you won't tell me?
- Can you tell me where witches...

09:36.709 --> 09:39.439
...were massacred in this town
a couple centuries ago?

09:39.612 --> 09:42.979
- No.
- Then you can't help.

09:47.520 --> 09:49.613
If it's any consolation...

09:49.789 --> 09:51.450
...I'm glad that you're not dead.

09:56.495 --> 09:58.986
Emily Bennett told me
about the massacre.

09:59.165 --> 10:01.156
It was a big deal in witch folklore.

10:03.235 --> 10:06.398
When a witch dies violently,
they release a mystical energy...

10:06.572 --> 10:10.064
...making the place of
their death with power.

10:10.242 --> 10:12.676
Elijah wanted to know
the site of the massacre.

10:13.346 --> 10:16.713
- What was he gonna do when he found it?
- I don't know.

10:16.882 --> 10:18.850
What did papa and baby
witch have to say?

10:19.018 --> 10:22.749
Isn't she gone or dead yet?

10:22.955 --> 10:24.718
For the last time, I'm here to help.

10:25.491 --> 10:27.220
Can we skip the secrets, hmm?

10:29.495 --> 10:32.020
Elijah had no weapon to kill Klaus.

10:32.698 --> 10:36.998
But he believed that if a witch
could channel enough power...

10:37.169 --> 10:39.160
...they wouldn't need one.

10:40.206 --> 10:43.698
Like the power you get from a spot
marked with a hundred dead witches?

10:43.876 --> 10:46.276
We just need to find it.

10:46.479 --> 10:50.677
- What if they can find the burial ground?
- They won't. We tried, Luka, for weeks.

10:50.850 --> 10:54.286
We don't have a back-up plan and we
need to be doing everything we can.

10:54.754 --> 10:56.585
We will save her.

10:56.756 --> 10:59.850
But Elijah is the answer,
not Stefan and his brother.

11:00.526 --> 11:04.724
Those people, they're our enemies.
They need to be dealt with.

11:04.930 --> 11:07.421
- What, you're going to kill them?
- No.

11:07.600 --> 11:10.034
I'm going to let Elijah do it.

11:17.710 --> 11:20.577
- Chinese food or pizza?
- Hmm, like you have to ask.

11:22.348 --> 11:24.373
I will get it.

11:29.288 --> 11:30.983
I'll do it.

11:32.992 --> 11:35.688
Do you believe
that Jonas is being sincere?

11:35.995 --> 11:37.986
I don't know what to believe.

11:38.164 --> 11:41.964
I think he's at a loss.
He's not sure who to trust.

11:42.134 --> 11:43.396
Join the club.

11:44.603 --> 11:48.369
Well, what are we going to do about
this movie situation? <i>The Notebook?</i>

11:48.541 --> 11:50.907
Caroline, how many times
have you seen that movie?

11:51.110 --> 11:54.136
- That is so not the point.
- Well, yeah, I mean...

11:55.214 --> 11:58.047
- Hey.
- What's going on?

11:59.418 --> 12:01.215
Girls' night.

12:02.722 --> 12:04.053
Oh.

12:04.690 --> 12:05.987
How are you doing?

12:06.692 --> 12:09.024
You heard about my fight with Ric.

12:09.195 --> 12:10.526
He feels terrible.

12:10.696 --> 12:13.028
Is this some kind of attempt
to cheer me up?

12:13.499 --> 12:17.492
No. No, this is about
us girls hanging out.

12:17.670 --> 12:20.935
And, you know, we'll be here
if you happen to want to talk, or...

12:21.507 --> 12:25.068
Because I am a winner when it
comes to successful relationships.

12:26.378 --> 12:28.846
- You too?
- You have no idea.

12:29.014 --> 12:30.879
Okay, then.

12:31.517 --> 12:35.578
This whole Isobel thing.
He's hiding something from me.

12:36.922 --> 12:41.859
To play devil's advocate, maybe there is
a great reason why he's not telling you.

12:42.027 --> 12:44.359
Maybe he is just trying to protect you.

12:44.530 --> 12:46.725
Well, that's not his call to make.

12:46.899 --> 12:51.199
- I deserve the truth. Everybody does.
- Sometimes it's harder than that.

12:52.037 --> 12:54.767
Not if it's somebody
you care about, it isn't.

12:58.544 --> 13:00.307
You know what we need?

13:00.679 --> 13:03.580
Dancing. There is a band at the Grill.

13:03.783 --> 13:04.807
- I'm in.
- In.

13:05.084 --> 13:06.210
In.

13:07.286 --> 13:08.810
In.

13:09.622 --> 13:12.056
Are you sure about this?

13:12.224 --> 13:14.556
I mean, I would go if I could.

13:14.727 --> 13:16.558
No. I'm not strong
enough to send you.

13:16.729 --> 13:18.629
But I can do this.

13:21.200 --> 13:22.667
I'll stay anchored.

13:22.835 --> 13:24.359
Use all my energy.

13:24.537 --> 13:26.937
- Lf you feel weak...
- Dad.

13:27.106 --> 13:28.903
I want this just as much as you.

13:38.317 --> 13:40.649
Concentrate on Elijah.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.913
Picture him in your mind.

13:44.723 --> 13:45.747
I got it.

14:04.109 --> 14:05.736
<i>I'm in the Salvatore house.</i>

14:06.545 --> 14:08.274
Elijah's body must be there.

14:17.690 --> 14:19.282
What do you see?

14:19.458 --> 14:21.187
<i>Elena and Damon. They're reading.</i>

14:21.360 --> 14:22.987
<i>Good.</i>

14:27.833 --> 14:31.462
<i>If Elijah's there, you'll sense him.</i>
<i>Stay focused.</i>

14:39.545 --> 14:40.876
Can I help you?

14:41.046 --> 14:42.638
I'm bored.

14:46.719 --> 14:49.153
"Emily Bennett was taken
by the Council today.

14:49.321 --> 14:52.085
They kidnapped her
and took her to the same location...

14:52.291 --> 14:54.987
...her ancestors were burned
a hundred years ago."

14:55.160 --> 14:58.220
So Emily died
on the site of the massacre too.

14:58.530 --> 15:01.021
- Mm-hm.
- Does it say where?

15:01.867 --> 15:03.698
Nope.

15:03.869 --> 15:06.099
You know this whole friendly,
cooperative thing?

15:06.272 --> 15:09.503
- Mm-hm.
- I don't buy it.

15:09.675 --> 15:11.609
I have no reason to lie to you, Damon.

15:11.810 --> 15:12.868
Lie.

15:14.747 --> 15:16.339
I'm hungry.

15:16.515 --> 15:19.245
You're the unwanted houseguest.
Go feed yourself.

15:43.442 --> 15:46.934
Well, nothing in any of these.

15:47.112 --> 15:48.636
Find anything?

15:50.849 --> 15:52.339
Nope.

15:57.056 --> 16:00.287
- That's too bad.
- Yeah, bummer.

16:25.884 --> 16:27.112
Elena's fighting me.

16:29.421 --> 16:30.979
What's wrong?

16:31.156 --> 16:32.885
She's stronger than me.

16:34.827 --> 16:36.761
That's because it's not Elena.

16:36.929 --> 16:39.898
It's Katherine Pierce. Luka, kill her.

16:41.700 --> 16:42.997
- What?
- She's a vampire.

16:43.168 --> 16:45.295
Find a stake
and drive it through her heart.

17:06.724 --> 17:08.454
Damon.

17:11.964 --> 17:13.727
Katherine.

17:25.044 --> 17:26.534
What happened?

17:28.280 --> 17:29.770
Damon...

17:32.217 --> 17:34.014
Luka, what's going on?

17:40.225 --> 17:43.558
Luka. Luka!

17:43.729 --> 17:45.697
- What are you doing?
- Some kind of crazy...

17:45.864 --> 17:49.664
...psychic witch attack. Get over
there and do something about it.

17:50.836 --> 17:52.565
Go.

17:53.439 --> 17:54.701
No!

17:57.209 --> 18:01.077
Oh, my God. Luka. Luka. I'm sorry.

18:01.246 --> 18:03.646
Please. Just wake up, son.

18:03.816 --> 18:05.215
Open your eyes.

18:22.534 --> 18:24.092
Luka.

18:36.582 --> 18:38.743
My boy.

18:40.686 --> 18:42.119
<i>Counting on tonight, stuck on you</i>

18:42.287 --> 18:45.654
<i>Counting on a fight</i>
<i>Punch-drunk truth</i>

18:45.824 --> 18:48.987
<i>Sorry I returned</i>
<i>Sorry I was late</i>

18:49.161 --> 18:52.790
<i>Now the tables have turned</i>
<i>Just a simple twist of fate</i>

18:52.965 --> 18:56.298
<i>Don't it make you feel small</i>
<i>In light of the world</i>

18:56.468 --> 18:59.164
<i>Don't it make you feel tall</i>
<i>A beautiful girl</i>

18:59.338 --> 19:00.566
Wow.

19:00.739 --> 19:03.469
<i>I know the plan, I know what I got coming</i>

19:03.642 --> 19:07.976
<i>Put the pistol in my hand</i>
<i>And then she started running</i>

19:08.147 --> 19:10.138
I need a drink.

19:10.315 --> 19:13.648
<i>Take anything you want</i>

19:13.819 --> 19:15.411
Hey, Matt.

19:17.156 --> 19:18.680
Let me get that for you.

19:19.158 --> 19:21.718
Things just got real awkward.

19:27.799 --> 19:29.460
- Jenna.
- Not tonight, Ric.

19:30.102 --> 19:33.503
Tonight I have traded you
for senor tequila.

19:33.672 --> 19:35.435
Yeah. Ha.

19:35.607 --> 19:38.770
Well, senor tequila's not going
to be treating you very well.

19:38.944 --> 19:40.935
Well, the two of you
have a lot in common.

19:41.113 --> 19:44.674
- I hate that you're this upset with me.
- Yeah, well, it's your fault.

19:44.850 --> 19:46.750
Whatever it is
you're keeping from me...

19:46.919 --> 19:49.080
...whatever you think I can't handle...

19:49.254 --> 19:50.585
...you're wrong.

19:50.756 --> 19:53.850
Because last year I was a grad student
who smoked a lot of pot...

19:54.059 --> 19:57.028
...and couldn't keep a goldfish alive.
And now I'm a parent...

19:57.196 --> 19:59.426
...so I think
I can handle anything, Ric.

19:59.598 --> 20:02.260
- Jenna.
- He said the ball's in your court.

20:02.434 --> 20:04.334
Yeah, but I can't do anything about it.

20:04.503 --> 20:08.200
Why not? All you do is talk about
how much you care about him.

20:08.373 --> 20:10.841
Yeah, but I am still keeping
so many secrets.

20:13.679 --> 20:17.547
Alaric's in the same boat with Jenna.
And maybe that's our mistake.

20:17.716 --> 20:19.343
We're trying to protect people...

20:19.518 --> 20:23.682
...by keeping them out of it, but in
the end, we're hurting them anyway.

20:34.032 --> 20:35.624
What are you doing?

20:35.801 --> 20:38.133
Where are you going?
Where is she going?

20:39.538 --> 20:41.472
Hey, everybody.

20:41.640 --> 20:43.574
Let's hear it for the band.
Aren't they awesome?

20:45.177 --> 20:47.475
This isn't gonna end well.

20:48.513 --> 20:50.708
So there's this guy.

20:50.882 --> 20:53.646
And, uh, he told me to tell him...

20:53.819 --> 20:56.310
...how I feel about him.

20:56.488 --> 20:58.479
Ha, ha. Like it's so easy.

20:58.790 --> 21:02.726
Um, just because I talk a lot
doesn't mean I always know...

21:02.894 --> 21:04.919
...what I'm actually talking about.

21:07.199 --> 21:08.757
Like now, I'm feeling loopy...

21:08.934 --> 21:13.428
...and I don't really know
how to express myself.

21:14.840 --> 21:16.603
I can sing.

21:16.775 --> 21:19.073
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Sing?

21:19.845 --> 21:22.245
You know what, I'm gonna sing.

21:22.414 --> 21:23.745
Come on, off the stage.

21:23.915 --> 21:26.281
You are gonna let me live
out my rock fantasies...

21:26.451 --> 21:28.783
...and you are going to be
my back-up.

21:30.756 --> 21:32.383
What will it be?

21:43.068 --> 21:45.195
<i>Close your eyes</i>

21:45.370 --> 21:48.897
<i>Give me your hand, darlin'</i>

21:49.074 --> 21:51.133
<i>Do you feel my heart beating?</i>

21:51.310 --> 21:52.800
She's good.

21:52.978 --> 21:54.104
<i>Do you understand?</i>

21:54.279 --> 21:55.303
Yeah.

21:55.480 --> 22:03.046
<i>Do you feel the same?</i>
<i>Am I only dreaming?</i>

22:03.221 --> 22:09.888
<i>Is this burning</i>
<i>An eternal flame?</i>

22:10.062 --> 22:15.762
<i>I believe it's meant to be, darlin'</i>

22:15.934 --> 22:21.304
<i>I watch you when you are sleeping</i>
<i>You belong to me</i>

22:21.473 --> 22:30.142
<i>Do you feel the same?</i>
<i>Am I only dreaming?</i>

22:30.315 --> 22:36.777
<i>Is this burning</i>
<i>An eternal flame?</i>

22:36.955 --> 22:41.415
<i>Say my name</i>
<i>Sun shines through the rain</i>

22:41.593 --> 22:48.328
<i>A whole life so Ionely</i>
<i>You come and ease the pain</i>

22:49.101 --> 22:54.266
<i>I don't want to lose this feeling</i>

22:54.439 --> 23:00.901
<i>Oh! Oh!</i>

23:02.614 --> 23:05.139
Matt, I...

24:03.575 --> 24:04.701
You killed him.

24:05.010 --> 24:07.911
- He's dead and I have no one.
- Aah! No.

24:08.079 --> 24:11.242
And now you're about to find out
exactly what that feels like.

24:36.475 --> 24:37.737
There you go.

24:44.115 --> 24:45.742
What the hell?

24:45.917 --> 24:49.080
That's for not telling me
the dagger would kill me.

24:49.955 --> 24:52.116
Next time...

24:52.324 --> 24:53.655
...it goes in your heart.

24:53.825 --> 24:56.293
Is that how you treat someone who...

24:57.662 --> 25:00.426
...is trying to help you?
- You wanna help?

25:00.599 --> 25:02.066
- Start talking.
- I'd love to...

25:02.234 --> 25:03.758
...but you're not gonna like it.

25:03.935 --> 25:06.665
- Try me.
- Fine.

25:06.838 --> 25:09.068
John Gilbert and Isobel
want you and Stefan...

25:09.241 --> 25:11.402
...out of Elena's life.

25:11.576 --> 25:12.907
That's old news.

25:13.078 --> 25:15.410
Not the part where
he offered me a deal.

25:16.648 --> 25:19.481
He knew that killing Elijah
would get me out of the tomb...

25:19.651 --> 25:22.176
...so he gave me a choice.

25:22.354 --> 25:25.812
Either I stay and help with Klaus,
or he kills Stefan.

25:26.725 --> 25:28.522
But he still tried to have me killed.

25:28.727 --> 25:30.490
Right. That was part of the deal.

25:30.662 --> 25:32.254
I could only save one of you.

25:33.732 --> 25:36.360
So you chose Stefan.

25:41.606 --> 25:43.096
Of course you did.

25:43.275 --> 25:44.765
You wanted the truth, Damon.

25:47.546 --> 25:48.979
Would you rather I lie?

26:01.126 --> 26:02.354
Uh, oh, sorry.

26:02.694 --> 26:04.559
Sorry, Elena.

26:10.201 --> 26:13.898
- I really have to get back to work.
- Definitely.

26:15.140 --> 26:18.234
Uh, I wouldn't. Caroline and Matt are...

26:18.410 --> 26:21.811
- In the bathroom?
- Lf they're happy, I'm happy.

26:22.013 --> 26:23.844
Um, hey, uh, speaking of happy...

26:24.015 --> 26:27.473
...would it freak you out
if I started dating your brother?

26:30.822 --> 26:33.586
- You're into my brother?
- I know it's weird...

26:33.792 --> 26:36.886
...but he's been so good and strong.

26:37.062 --> 26:38.996
He makes me happy.

26:40.231 --> 26:43.894
And I really can't tell
what you're thinking right now.

26:45.804 --> 26:48.500
I'm thinking that...

26:49.708 --> 26:53.508
...my brother has had
more pain in his life...

26:53.678 --> 26:56.511
...than a hundred people's
worth of pain...

26:57.716 --> 27:00.549
...and he deserves to be with
someone as amazing as you.

27:02.187 --> 27:03.745
Really?

27:04.756 --> 27:06.121
Really.

27:15.333 --> 27:16.698
Phone.

27:18.770 --> 27:20.897
Hey, Stefan, I'm at the Grill.

27:21.072 --> 27:24.337
I can't hear you. Hold... Yeah.

27:43.962 --> 27:45.293
Where are you going?

27:45.463 --> 27:48.091
Luka Martin's dead.
His father's going after Elena.

27:48.266 --> 27:50.826
- I'm coming with you.
- No, you're not.

27:51.002 --> 27:52.629
- Wait.
- I don't need your help.

27:52.804 --> 27:56.069
- I don't want it.
- I know what we can do, Damon.

27:56.241 --> 27:57.572
You have to let me do it.

28:00.178 --> 28:02.738
Dr. Martin. You okay?

28:02.914 --> 28:04.848
Where is she?

28:05.016 --> 28:06.574
I don't understand.

28:06.751 --> 28:08.412
My son is dead.

28:10.288 --> 28:13.280
Whatever it is you think you
need to do, there's a better way.

28:13.458 --> 28:15.926
They killed Elijah
and they killed Luka.

28:16.094 --> 28:18.654
And my only shot at getting
my daughter back is Elena.

28:18.830 --> 28:20.388
No. No, Dr. Martin.

28:24.936 --> 28:25.994
Where is she?

28:26.171 --> 28:28.401
I don't know. I haven't seen her.

28:37.515 --> 28:39.210
What the hell?

28:46.658 --> 28:49.491
- The power's out.
- Ha. Even better.

28:50.128 --> 28:52.562
I wish, but I should probably...

29:06.444 --> 29:07.468
Hey.

29:07.645 --> 29:09.806
- We have a problem.
- What's going on?

29:09.981 --> 29:11.881
Jonas is here and he's after Elena.

29:12.050 --> 29:13.642
- Oh, my God.
- We have a plan...

29:13.852 --> 29:16.082
...but I need to get Elena out of here.

29:16.254 --> 29:18.745
- Well, what can I do?
- It's time to get out of here.

29:18.957 --> 29:21.425
- Have to find Elena.
- She's with Stefan, she's okay.

29:21.593 --> 29:23.993
No one's getting out
of here until I have her.

29:24.162 --> 29:26.187
Don't do this. Please don't do this.

29:44.916 --> 29:47.510
Bonnie. Hey, Bonnie.

29:48.920 --> 29:52.014
Bonnie. Bonnie. Hey, Bonnie.

29:52.190 --> 29:53.748
Come on. Come on.

29:58.062 --> 30:01.930
Dr. Martin. I'm so sorry about Luka.

30:02.100 --> 30:04.091
We never wanted that to happen...

30:04.269 --> 30:06.533
...but let us help you
get your daughter back.

30:06.704 --> 30:08.296
Only Elijah can do that.

30:08.506 --> 30:10.133
You don't need Elijah.

30:28.259 --> 30:29.658
Caroline.

30:30.929 --> 30:32.055
Get away from her.

30:32.230 --> 30:33.959
Matt, no!

30:37.669 --> 30:39.330
Matt!

30:40.171 --> 30:42.935
Matt. No.

30:53.084 --> 30:54.949
Matt. Matt.

30:55.386 --> 30:57.286
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

30:57.455 --> 30:59.047
Okay.

31:00.258 --> 31:01.589
Hey. Hey.

31:02.927 --> 31:05.794
Just breathe, Caroline, just breathe.

31:15.640 --> 31:17.938
You have to drink. Please, please.

31:26.417 --> 31:28.044
Luka.

31:28.753 --> 31:30.653
I can't believe he's dead.

31:30.822 --> 31:34.155
- After what we did to him.
- No, after what he did to you.

31:34.325 --> 31:37.260
Look, I'm sorry, I know you
feel bad about all this...

31:37.428 --> 31:41.194
...but I don't.
- I couldn't do anything to help.

31:41.699 --> 31:44.862
I was useless. I hated it.

31:46.838 --> 31:49.329
- Thank God.
- It's not over yet.

31:49.507 --> 31:52.067
- What's going on?
- He'll explain.

31:55.380 --> 31:57.075
When did you guys get home?

31:57.282 --> 31:59.682
- A few minutes ago.
- Did you check the house?

31:59.851 --> 32:02.081
And why would we check the house?

32:34.752 --> 32:36.481
You're welcome.

32:42.660 --> 32:45.857
- You didn't have to kill him.
- Yes, we did.

33:04.215 --> 33:06.046
Get off.

33:22.767 --> 33:25.133
How did you guys
convince her to do this?

33:25.303 --> 33:27.863
We didn't. It was actually her idea.

33:28.506 --> 33:30.633
Wow, that's not good.

33:30.808 --> 33:33.675
No. No, that's not good at all.

33:33.878 --> 33:36.142
Everything's taken care of.

33:36.314 --> 33:38.805
I'm guessing you're going
to want this back.

33:39.751 --> 33:43.517
But your pretty little outfit
is going to need a good dry-clean.

33:46.824 --> 33:49.918
You're gonna have to get her out
of here before Jenna gets home.

33:50.661 --> 33:52.322
Is that all you have to say to me?

33:53.898 --> 33:56.765
This doesn't change
the way I feel about you.

33:56.934 --> 33:59.630
I don't much like you, either,
if we're going to be open.

33:59.804 --> 34:02.466
And frankly, I'd be
happy to see you dead...

34:02.640 --> 34:06.508
...but if we're going to try to take on
Klaus, we kind of need you to be alive.

34:06.677 --> 34:09.202
So I'm not a threat to you, Elena.

34:09.614 --> 34:13.208
If any of you are going to
believe anything, believe that.

34:17.655 --> 34:20.283
Thanks for getting me home.

34:20.458 --> 34:21.550
That was kind of crazy.

34:23.226 --> 34:25.127
Jenna, are you going to be okay?

34:27.732 --> 34:30.632
Look, Isobel is dead.

34:30.935 --> 34:33.301
And there things about her death...

34:33.538 --> 34:37.371
...that I can't tell you.
That aren't for me to tell.

34:37.875 --> 34:40.206
You can be upset and hate me.

34:40.378 --> 34:43.005
I get it. But just know...

34:43.481 --> 34:45.380
...that I love you.

34:49.020 --> 34:51.181
At least I can tell you that much.

34:58.830 --> 35:00.457
Good night, Ric.

35:04.102 --> 35:05.729
Good night.

35:15.046 --> 35:17.606
Hey. You made it home.

35:17.782 --> 35:20.717
Tonight was very weird.

35:21.519 --> 35:23.510
Tell me about it.

35:23.688 --> 35:25.952
- <i>I'm worried about you.</i>
- <i>Don't be.</i>

35:26.124 --> 35:27.716
No, I'm serious, Bonnie.

35:27.892 --> 35:30.622
The witch that could give
you your powers back is dead...

35:30.795 --> 35:33.525
...and I think you have a
serious case of denial going...

35:33.698 --> 35:37.862
...and I want you to know that I'm here
for you no matter what, and I'm not...

35:47.111 --> 35:49.602
Not that denial's the worst thing.

35:58.523 --> 36:00.320
- Did you...?
- Shh.

36:05.796 --> 36:07.127
When he grabbed me...

36:09.467 --> 36:12.436
...he gave me my powers back.

36:14.805 --> 36:16.500
And something else.

36:16.674 --> 36:19.905
Jonas wants me to kill Klaus.

36:21.779 --> 36:23.940
And did he include a how?

36:25.950 --> 36:27.781
Yeah.

36:27.952 --> 36:29.351
He did.

36:34.058 --> 36:36.925
- You know what I can't figure out?
- What's that?

36:37.094 --> 36:39.358
How the town knew
Emily Bennett was a witch.

36:39.564 --> 36:42.124
I mean, because according
to Johnathan Gilbert...

36:42.300 --> 36:43.927
...he was the only one who knew.

36:45.336 --> 36:47.861
I know he didn't turn her in.

36:49.140 --> 36:51.005
Mm, I should have figured as much.

36:51.175 --> 36:54.008
She was a loose end.
I like mine tied up.

36:54.178 --> 36:57.636
- You know what I can't figure out?
- Do I care?

36:57.848 --> 37:01.284
Why you won't tell me where to find
the site of the witch massacre.

37:01.452 --> 37:03.147
Because I have no clue.

37:03.321 --> 37:06.290
You knew Emily Bennett was
key to getting me out of the tomb.

37:06.457 --> 37:09.017
Something tells me you
did everything in your power...

37:09.193 --> 37:11.058
...to make sure that she was safe...

37:11.229 --> 37:13.891
...yet you have no idea
where she was killed.

37:15.233 --> 37:16.825
Who's the liar now?

37:19.904 --> 37:22.702
- You hurt me today.
- Tit for tat.

37:22.873 --> 37:26.070
You were mean. And very rough.

37:26.244 --> 37:27.905
And monstrous.

37:28.112 --> 37:29.409
You deserved it.

37:30.648 --> 37:34.345
- I like this Damon.
- Katherine.

37:34.518 --> 37:39.353
Katherine, there are six
other bedrooms in this house.

37:40.758 --> 37:42.191
Go find one.

38:11.589 --> 38:13.250
Hi.

38:15.593 --> 38:17.390
What the hell?

38:19.196 --> 38:20.925
Your face...

38:21.666 --> 38:23.258
...and all the blood. L...

38:23.434 --> 38:25.561
I drank your blood.

38:26.203 --> 38:30.196
You were dying. My blood healed you.

38:30.374 --> 38:32.205
What do you mean, it healed me?

38:32.376 --> 38:33.809
How can your blood heal me?

38:35.946 --> 38:38.972
Because that's what vampire
blood does for humans...

38:39.183 --> 38:41.310
...and that's what I am.

38:42.420 --> 38:44.615
I'm a vampire, Matt.

38:47.591 --> 38:49.718
- No.
- But it's all gonna be okay.

38:49.894 --> 38:51.225
I'll tell you everything...

38:51.395 --> 38:53.829
...and you'll understand
why I kept it from you...

38:53.998 --> 38:56.330
...and we're gonna be fine.
- We'll be fine?

38:56.500 --> 38:59.799
Yes, because we're together
and we love each other.

39:02.707 --> 39:04.504
Vampires.

39:04.709 --> 39:06.700
Oh, my God.

39:09.447 --> 39:12.416
Vickie, at the hospital,
I thought that she was tripping out.

39:12.917 --> 39:15.750
- What?
- Vickie, she knew about the vampires...

39:15.920 --> 39:17.945
...and I...

39:22.727 --> 39:24.024
What did you do?

39:24.862 --> 39:28.457
- Nothing. Nothing. Matt.
- I need to get out of here.

39:28.632 --> 39:31.692
No, no, no. I can't let you leave.

39:31.869 --> 39:34.963
- Okay, not like this.
- What did you do to my sister?

39:35.139 --> 39:37.266
Nothing.
I swear, I swear, nothing, nothing.

39:37.441 --> 39:38.874
- What did you do?
- Nothing.

39:39.043 --> 39:41.170
You have to calm down. Matt.

39:44.515 --> 39:46.346
Are John and Jeremy asleep?

39:46.517 --> 39:48.178
I think so.

39:49.754 --> 39:51.187
If I go to bed right now...

39:51.355 --> 39:53.846
...there's a chance
I'll wake up hangover-free.

39:56.026 --> 39:57.687
Who's that?

40:09.673 --> 40:12.767
Hi. You must be Jenna.

40:17.014 --> 40:20.541
I'm Elena's mother.

40:24.889 --> 40:25.913
Isobel.
