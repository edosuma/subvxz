WEBVTT

00:35.030 --> 00:38.693
The ear has fluid, but it's not infected.

00:39.530 --> 00:41.612
If he develops a fever
or the pain gets worse,

00:41.700 --> 00:43.952
call me and I'll write a prescription.

00:44.620 --> 00:46.201
Yes, thank you, Dr. Delgado.

00:46.290 --> 00:49.123
-Tell the doctor thank you.
-Thank you.

00:50.630 --> 00:51.756
How's Max?

00:52.670 --> 00:55.969
He must be turning... nine?

00:56.380 --> 00:57.961
Yes, this month.

01:03.640 --> 01:05.130
See you tomorrow, Luca.

01:05.230 --> 01:06.436
See you later, doctor.

01:30.880 --> 01:33.371
-Dr. Delgado?
-Yes?

01:59.990 --> 02:01.526
-Hurry!
-Let's go!

02:11.960 --> 02:13.370
This is a mistake.

02:14.130 --> 02:15.950
-I'm not a wealthy man.
-Shut up.

02:17.670 --> 02:19.331
You don't want to do this.

02:21.300 --> 02:22.506
I know people.

02:23.430 --> 02:24.806
Powerful men.

02:26.640 --> 02:28.380
You don't want to mess with them.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.285
Don't move.

05:09.140 --> 05:10.630
This is not right.

05:11.810 --> 05:13.550
-Take that shit off.
-It's not right.

05:28.360 --> 05:30.271
The men who killed your agent...

05:31.240 --> 05:33.151
they're all in prison.

05:37.670 --> 05:39.820
It wasn't what you think.

05:41.250 --> 05:44.333
I was brought to the house
where the American was held.

05:45.130 --> 05:46.506
They didn't tell me why.

05:47.970 --> 05:49.460
I had nothing to do with it!

05:50.180 --> 05:52.421
I only gave him medical care.

05:52.930 --> 05:54.921
And pleaded with them to let him go.

05:56.600 --> 05:58.841
With everything I had, I pleaded!

06:05.530 --> 06:09.352
Need him conscious.
Fucker keeps passmg out; doc.

06:09.950 --> 06:12.111
Adrenaline mil keep him up. Ho/o’ him.

06:17.410 --> 06:19.412
See? .7 told you so.

06:19.500 --> 06:21.741
Come on, asshole.
Aren ’1' you going to say anything?

06:21.830 --> 06:25.334
Wait; hold on. Let him finish waking up.

06:26.210 --> 06:27.962
Got any cigarettes? I ’m out. . .

06:28.050 --> 06:30.962
Go aheao; o’oc. We 7/ keep at it in here.

07:14.720 --> 07:17.052
The other person on the tape...

07:18.220 --> 07:19.630
tell me his name.

07:57.970 --> 07:59.847
Miguel ngel, what time Is it?

08:02.020 --> 08:03.430
Very early, darling.

08:05.100 --> 08:06.897
Couldn't sleep again?

08:08.150 --> 08:09.139
Yeah.

08:09.610 --> 08:10.929
Not even a little.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.706
Happy birthday, my love.

08:35.800 --> 08:37.631
I've never fucked a 40-year-old.

08:48.940 --> 08:49.929
Excuse me.

08:50.320 --> 08:51.639
Zuno's here, sir.

08:52.690 --> 08:53.645
Good.

08:54.200 --> 08:56.521
-Have him wait on the patio, Clavel.
-Got it.

08:59.410 --> 09:01.787
-I think she needs to be changed.
-Yes, ma'am.

09:08.960 --> 09:11.542
Excited for the party tonight?

09:13.170 --> 09:14.046
Sure.

09:17.050 --> 09:19.132
Cynthia, I'll take my coffee on the patio.

09:19.220 --> 09:21.176
-Yes, sir.
-Love, wait.

09:27.140 --> 09:28.141
Open it.

09:29.190 --> 09:30.350
Oh, wow.

09:31.570 --> 09:33.185
You don't have that one, right?

09:35.360 --> 09:36.770
No, I don't think so.

09:38.200 --> 09:39.315
It's very nice.

09:40.580 --> 09:41.899
Put it with the others.

09:43.790 --> 09:44.825
Thank you.

09:52.250 --> 09:53.911
What's the word on your uncle?

09:55.210 --> 09:56.541
Sends his regrets.

09:57.260 --> 09:59.501
Turns out he _won't be able
to make It tonight.

10:00.760 --> 10:01.795
Oh, really.

10:02.640 --> 10:03.959
Cabinet meetings.

10:04.810 --> 10:07.938
I want three fucking governors tonight.

10:09.230 --> 10:12.472
The government is my partner.
It doesn't look good if they're not here.

10:14.400 --> 10:15.355
Hey...

10:16.610 --> 10:18.521
everybody loves a party.

10:19.200 --> 10:20.189
That's good.

10:22.660 --> 10:24.366
The envelope for this month
hasn't arrived yet.

10:26.500 --> 10:27.706
I'll look into it.

10:27.830 --> 10:29.741
Usually it comes first of the month.

10:29.830 --> 10:32.162
-People are asking--
-You'll get your money.

10:32.500 --> 10:33.455
Like always.

10:34.840 --> 10:38.412
But I don't want to have
political problems.

10:39.300 --> 10:41.461
The government's shitting itself
over the quake.

10:42.050 --> 10:44.211
People know they're being lied to.

10:47.020 --> 10:47.975
They'll get over it.

10:49.020 --> 10:50.305
Where else can they go?

10:52.560 --> 10:53.549
It's the government.

10:57.900 --> 10:59.140
Life goes on.

11:00.740 --> 11:02.196
The past is the past.

14:08.970 --> 14:10.756
Miss Isabella, how are you?

14:11.930 --> 14:13.306
The boss is expecting you.

14:13.720 --> 14:15.176
Lead the way.

14:15.270 --> 14:16.510
Careful not to slip.

14:16.850 --> 14:18.340
Wait here.

14:42.750 --> 14:43.990
Business looks good.

14:44.550 --> 14:46.120
Everything looks good.

14:47.590 --> 14:51.378
I just wish we were meeting somewhere
more comfortable.

14:52.300 --> 14:54.097
This is where our business is done.

14:56.310 --> 14:57.208
Please.

15:06.820 --> 15:07.855
Ramn!

15:10.280 --> 15:11.520
'Mn!

15:12.240 --> 15:13.309
Let's go!

15:15.780 --> 15:19.364
-All our stuff's broken down?
-Yeah, boss, ready to move.

15:20.870 --> 15:24.169
How long am I gonna have to look
at this Sinaloan shit, Nstor?

15:24.250 --> 15:27.128
Haven't heard anything since
they dropped it off a few days ago.

15:27.340 --> 15:30.218
Maybe Hctor Palma forgot
how a phone works.

15:30.300 --> 15:34.009
I mean, ifI left 618 kilos
in someone else's warehouse,

15:34.680 --> 15:37.422
I'd show a little more courtesy.

15:37.510 --> 15:38.920
You counted it.

15:39.390 --> 15:40.379
You didn't?

15:40.850 --> 15:42.556
Take that shit somewhere else.

15:44.520 --> 15:47.398
Maybe using our plaza isn't enough,
Benjamn.

15:47.610 --> 15:50.181
We're supposed to move it
for them now too.

15:52.570 --> 15:54.106
Put it somewhere else, Nstor.

15:55.030 --> 15:56.611
Just get it out of the fucking way.

15:56.700 --> 15:57.655
Yes, boss.

16:00.080 --> 16:01.650
You ready for tonight?

16:01.960 --> 16:02.949
Yeah.

16:03.830 --> 16:04.990
Know what you're going to say?

16:05.080 --> 16:07.583
Yes, Enedina,
I know what I'm going to say.

16:08.380 --> 16:09.620
It's important, Benjamn.

16:11.220 --> 16:13.211
Our family is losing money every day.

16:13.380 --> 16:15.712
We're getting fucked,
and it needs to be dealt with.

16:17.050 --> 16:17.880
Well...

16:18.430 --> 16:21.137
I just hope we're sending the right person
to handle it.

16:24.400 --> 16:25.219
Ramn!

16:27.610 --> 16:29.680
Don't wake up Mom when you get home.

16:31.690 --> 16:34.318
-And don't let him drink too much.
-Anything else, Enedina?

16:35.740 --> 16:36.980
-No.
-No.

16:39.990 --> 16:40.945
Hey, 'Dina.

16:44.540 --> 16:46.246
You look so handsome.

16:46.580 --> 16:48.036
-Have fun tonight.
-Yeah.

16:48.130 --> 16:49.199
Hey, man.

16:49.630 --> 16:50.540
What?

16:50.880 --> 16:52.006
It's for the drive.

16:52.630 --> 16:54.712
Tonight is business.
I need you to be cool.

16:54.800 --> 16:55.960
I'm always cool, you be cool.

16:57.220 --> 16:58.790
Lighten up a little.

17:01.890 --> 17:02.970
Let's go, then.

17:15.820 --> 17:17.526
Hit the horn again, Gero.

17:21.200 --> 17:22.406
Hey, man!

17:22.580 --> 17:25.401
When we get there, we need to check
on the boss's birthday present.

17:25.500 --> 17:27.456
-The guy called me, it's already there.
-Good.

17:27.540 --> 17:30.202
Everything's cool. We got it a room.

17:30.880 --> 17:32.791
A fucking hotel, Cochi?

17:33.210 --> 17:34.461
Sure, why not?

17:38.890 --> 17:40.005
Your blessing, Ma.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.709
May God bless and take care of you.

17:42.810 --> 17:44.175
Be safe, my son.

17:46.350 --> 17:48.762
-Have fun.
-Climb in, motherfucker.

17:49.270 --> 17:50.100
Hello, Mrs. Guzmn!

17:52.150 --> 17:53.390
What the fuck's that?

17:53.480 --> 17:55.277
Trying to get your dick sucked or what?

17:56.110 --> 17:57.941
Fuck off. Let me pack this in.

17:58.410 --> 18:00.275
You know we were bringing wives?

18:00.990 --> 18:01.979
Fucking Gero.

18:03.290 --> 18:04.689
True love, Cochi.

18:10.210 --> 18:11.165
Hey, Gero.

18:11.420 --> 18:12.876
Fucking Chapo.

18:12.960 --> 18:13.949
Hey, Guadalupe.

18:23.970 --> 18:24.959
It’s Amado.

18:25.430 --> 18:26.385
What happened?

18:26.480 --> 18:30.098
What do you mean nothing? I’ve been
waihng l/ke an idiot at the airport.

18:30.400 --> 18:31.549
Where's Acosta?

18:34.900 --> 18:36.231
Fuck. He isn't coming?

18:42.370 --> 18:45.407
He's the boss. How does that look?

18:48.160 --> 18:49.286
Asshole.

18:53.340 --> 18:55.046
Hey, let's go now.

23:16.770 --> 23:17.805
What happened?

23:42.210 --> 23:43.700
I put you down for two million.

23:45.210 --> 23:49.249
That money we're collecting to push those
Sandinista fuckers out of Nicaragua.

23:51.300 --> 23:52.585
Everyone's chipping in.

23:53.430 --> 23:54.795
It's good for business.

23:58.390 --> 23:59.596
Let's hope so.

24:01.020 --> 24:03.477
I've got planes in the air for you
night and day.

24:04.480 --> 24:07.108
We're pushing more volume
through Mexico than ever.

24:07.190 --> 24:09.397
My problem isn't volume...

24:10.280 --> 24:11.520
it's cash flow.

24:12.530 --> 24:15.408
That bullshit at the border
can't go on forever, right?

24:16.740 --> 24:18.651
He's coming tonight, right?

24:19.120 --> 24:21.111
They told me he'll be here.

24:21.200 --> 24:23.031
Are you sure?

24:23.460 --> 24:24.916
Try to relax.

24:31.010 --> 24:32.910
You want an outsider's opinion?

24:35.590 --> 24:37.217
What you're asking right now...

24:38.680 --> 24:39.749
it's a lot,

24:40.970 --> 24:42.926
given how things have been going.

24:44.560 --> 24:47.222
My people are asking questions.

24:48.730 --> 24:50.106
I'm out of time.

24:51.400 --> 24:53.061
I have to talk to him tonight.

24:54.650 --> 24:55.810
Good luck.

25:01.910 --> 25:04.492
So, how much did you ha ye in mind?

25:05.080 --> 25:06.286
How much have you got?

25:08.340 --> 25:10.126
Two hundred kilos.

25:10.920 --> 25:14.083
That's a lot of powder for a house party.

25:15.840 --> 25:18.001
What are your plans for it?

25:21.140 --> 25:24.928
I hope you know, anyone can buy merch.

25:25.140 --> 25:26.346
It's easy.

25:27.270 --> 25:28.555
What's tricky?

25:28.650 --> 25:31.016
Transportation and distribution.

25:33.030 --> 25:34.600
Tell me something I don't know.

25:38.320 --> 25:41.869
What will you tell your friend
in Guadalajara?

25:42.870 --> 25:44.861
What will you tell your friends in Cali?

25:45.910 --> 25:46.911
Nothing.

25:49.710 --> 25:53.202
You and I are going to make
a lot of money.

26:03.680 --> 26:04.920
It's been a pleasure.

26:42.350 --> 26:43.305
Gero.

26:44.470 --> 26:45.380
Amado.

26:45.970 --> 26:48.097
-Hey, man.
-Nothing, just hanging.

26:48.180 --> 26:50.592
-Lupita, how are you?
-Good, and you, Amado?

26:50.690 --> 26:52.351
-All good.
-Where's Acosta?

26:52.440 --> 26:54.226
Something came up.

26:54.520 --> 26:56.317
-Everything cool?
-Yeah, all good.

26:56.400 --> 26:58.311
-See you inside.
-You got it.

27:01.620 --> 27:02.689
What's up, Chapo?

27:03.070 --> 27:05.368
-What's up, Amado?
-Nothing, just here. Hey, Cochi.

27:05.450 --> 27:06.360
Amado.

27:06.790 --> 27:08.655
Nice shirt, man.

27:11.460 --> 27:13.166
He carried it here in a bag.

27:13.250 --> 27:16.492
-His mommy ironed it for him.
-Shut up!

27:16.800 --> 27:17.755
Let's go.

27:45.620 --> 27:47.611
You hear what we got the boss?

27:50.410 --> 27:52.742
Fucking blow your mind, brother.

27:53.960 --> 27:55.587
You want, we can cut you in on it.

27:56.040 --> 27:58.543
Sell you, like... 20, 25%.

27:58.800 --> 28:01.587
Maybe 15, since it was our idea.

28:02.720 --> 28:04.176
I'm good, Cochi.

28:05.050 --> 28:06.881
-See you around.
-All right.

28:11.890 --> 28:14.723
Look at these two motherfuckers.

28:15.730 --> 28:18.392
Tijuana pussies made an appearance.

28:22.070 --> 28:23.355
Fucking donkeys.

28:25.320 --> 28:27.572
If they didn't kiss Flix's ass,

28:29.830 --> 28:31.070
they'd starve.

28:32.580 --> 28:33.706
For sure.

28:50.930 --> 28:52.227
You awake?

28:52.640 --> 28:53.470
Let's go!

29:06.740 --> 29:08.867
Put your fucking head down!

29:40.440 --> 29:41.475
Come in.

29:44.900 --> 29:46.060
Zuno's here.

29:46.400 --> 29:47.731
With the governors.

29:48.570 --> 29:49.867
Stay sharp.

29:49.950 --> 29:51.941
They might steal the silverware.

29:54.580 --> 29:57.287
They're asking for you. Everyone is.

29:59.380 --> 30:01.871
You find out what time his plane lands?

30:03.880 --> 30:04.869
Not yet.

30:06.340 --> 30:07.466
Do it.

30:08.220 --> 30:09.505
Let me know.

30:10.970 --> 30:13.131
-The governors--
-I heard you, Azul.

31:09.990 --> 31:11.730
How are you all doing tonight?

31:12.410 --> 31:13.775
You came through.

31:13.910 --> 31:15.446
Of course.

31:15.540 --> 31:18.407
-Governor, how are you?
-Hey, how are you?

31:18.540 --> 31:20.201
Nice to finally meet you.

33:36.550 --> 33:37.756
Got a light, man?

33:39.720 --> 33:40.675
Yeah.

33:50.770 --> 33:52.647
Think this shit's gonna work?

33:57.160 --> 33:59.025
You go back with all these
gabachos?

34:00.120 --> 34:01.189
Just Walt.

34:02.910 --> 34:04.070
A few years.

34:05.960 --> 34:07.029
Me too.

34:08.170 --> 34:11.458
Motherfucker. Gets around, huh?

34:21.760 --> 34:22.806
Who you with?

34:24.220 --> 34:25.721
What kind of badge you carrying?

34:27.810 --> 34:29.266
Used to be MFJP.

34:30.270 --> 34:31.430
Up near Jurez.

34:34.480 --> 34:36.391
Jalisco State Police.

34:40.990 --> 34:42.070
"Used to be"?

34:44.490 --> 34:45.821
You retire or something?

34:52.380 --> 34:53.836
You writing a book?

35:06.430 --> 35:07.476
Hey, there.

35:08.060 --> 35:09.596
This is where all the action is?

35:11.060 --> 35:12.721
Just having some drinks, man.

35:13.270 --> 35:16.933
Heard you got the boss
some crazy present.

35:18.190 --> 35:19.771
It's a surprise, man.

35:19.860 --> 35:23.364
-Wait around a bit and we'll bring it out.
-Yeah, we'll bring it out later.

35:25.950 --> 35:27.156
Who's that?

35:27.410 --> 35:29.787
Clavel, Flix's new guy.

35:30.620 --> 35:31.609
Pussy.

35:40.260 --> 35:41.420
What's up, Amado?

35:42.470 --> 35:43.585
Hey, man.

35:44.010 --> 35:47.059
What's going on, you hiding from me?

35:47.890 --> 35:51.382
Not at all, just admiring the view.

35:53.690 --> 35:54.896
How's Jurez?

35:56.690 --> 35:58.931
It's Jurez. You know.

36:00.650 --> 36:01.947
So, what's the deal?

36:02.360 --> 36:03.600
Why isn't Acosta here?

36:04.200 --> 36:05.519
He trying to tell me something?

36:05.620 --> 36:08.532
No, some shit came up.

36:09.540 --> 36:10.825
He sends his best.

36:16.040 --> 36:17.337
I've been thinking, man,

36:17.420 --> 36:20.799
what if I came home
and got back to transpo?

36:21.380 --> 36:22.927
With planes and shit.

36:23.010 --> 36:26.343
Acosta's on top of Jurez.
He can handle it.

36:26.470 --> 36:28.426
That's not what I'm hearing.

36:29.430 --> 36:32.843
I paid for two new runways
that are still unpaved.

36:34.270 --> 36:36.807
The man's respected in his plaza, but...

36:37.610 --> 36:39.100
he's old-fashioned.

36:39.480 --> 36:41.311
Doesn't see the future.

36:42.860 --> 36:44.771
Jurez is very important.

36:46.990 --> 36:48.321
Trust me, Amado.

36:49.540 --> 36:51.496
One day, you'll see why.

36:51.950 --> 36:53.360
I need someone I can rely on.

36:53.960 --> 36:57.452
If that's not you, let me know,
and I find someone else.

36:59.130 --> 37:00.199
We're good.

37:06.260 --> 37:07.545
Talked to your uncle?

37:09.260 --> 37:10.887
Just a few times.

37:11.060 --> 37:13.176
Says he doesn't want visitors.

37:15.850 --> 37:17.977
If you talk to Neto, tell him...

37:18.940 --> 37:20.476
tell him I think about him a lot.

37:22.690 --> 37:23.736
Will do.

37:25.400 --> 37:27.903
Hey, testing.

37:28.990 --> 37:31.823
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

37:32.160 --> 37:36.244
Some fucking party
the boss put together, no?

37:39.250 --> 37:43.835
I'm going to ask you to take a seat
and clear the area a bit, please.

37:44.420 --> 37:45.796
Clear that side, please.

37:47.010 --> 37:50.047
We have a very special surprise today.

37:54.350 --> 37:55.305
Boss...

37:57.810 --> 37:59.050
Bring it, Chapo!

38:24.590 --> 38:25.625
A fucking tiger?

39:08.090 --> 39:10.502
Every jungle needs a boss!

39:10.800 --> 39:12.506
Here's to ours.

39:13.600 --> 39:15.340
Happy birthday, Miguel ngel.

39:16.100 --> 39:18.887
Your friends from Sinaloa... salute you.

39:19.690 --> 39:23.182
Happy birthday!

39:23.400 --> 39:24.469
Thank you, Gero!

39:25.440 --> 39:26.930
It's a lovely animal.

39:27.030 --> 39:28.315
Thank you, everybody!

39:29.450 --> 39:30.519
Hit it!

39:41.420 --> 39:42.819
-Miguel ngel.
-What's up?

39:42.960 --> 39:44.416
Where are we going to keep it?

39:44.750 --> 39:47.127
What kind of people give a wild animal
like that?

39:47.210 --> 39:49.508
I know. What can you do?
That's how they are.

39:49.590 --> 39:51.501
It's a gift, darling, no big deal.

39:51.590 --> 39:54.639
Wait till they get back to Sinaloa
and we'll donate it to a zoo.

39:54.800 --> 39:56.381
They're endangered, you know?

39:56.470 --> 39:58.097
I know.

40:01.270 --> 40:02.430
Miguel ngel.

40:02.810 --> 40:04.186
You remember Lupita?

40:04.310 --> 40:06.392
-Of course.
-Happy Birthday, Miguel ngel.

40:06.480 --> 40:08.937
-Thank you. You look pretty.
-Thank you.

40:09.030 --> 40:11.567
-Amazing gift, man.
-So beautiful, no?

40:11.740 --> 40:12.559
Flix...

40:14.070 --> 40:15.822
Know what's cool?

40:16.950 --> 40:19.498
Look at them in the eye,
they won't fuck with you.

40:20.200 --> 40:23.658
Tigers kill from behind. By ambush.

40:24.330 --> 40:28.084
Dudes in India walk around with masks
tied to the back of their heads,

40:28.170 --> 40:30.547
with eyes painted, to keep 'em safe.

40:31.050 --> 40:34.588
-What a good idea.
-Yeah, like a second face.

40:34.890 --> 40:37.176
I'll have to get one, right?

40:37.260 --> 40:38.966
I should have it on right now.

40:39.470 --> 40:41.267
-Thanks for coming.
-Thank you.

40:45.520 --> 40:47.056
That's Mara?

40:48.900 --> 40:50.470
Mara is the old wife.

40:50.570 --> 40:51.810
This is the new one.

40:52.400 --> 40:53.389
Daniela.

40:54.030 --> 40:55.600
She doesn't like your gift.

40:55.950 --> 40:57.861
After all the trouble you went through.

40:57.950 --> 40:59.281
She doesn't get it, Lupita.

40:59.790 --> 41:01.109
It's a symbol.

41:01.950 --> 41:03.781
Seemed like Flix liked it, right?

41:07.170 --> 41:09.547
-She's a fucking snob.
-Yeah.

41:10.130 --> 41:12.200
-So, anything?
-No.

41:12.880 --> 41:14.040
Shit.

41:14.130 --> 41:15.210
It's late already.

41:15.300 --> 41:17.211
Find out if his plane landed.

41:17.300 --> 41:18.346
I'll ask.

41:20.640 --> 41:21.675
He's coming.

41:21.770 --> 41:22.839
Don't worry.

41:23.230 --> 41:24.345
Let's hope.

41:26.230 --> 41:30.109
Heard your new pet ate one of the peacocks
before it came out.

41:30.320 --> 41:31.139
What?

41:31.570 --> 41:32.730
Just kidding!

41:35.780 --> 41:36.849
Miguel ngel.

41:37.740 --> 41:38.980
Happy birthday.

41:39.490 --> 41:40.525
Benjamn.

41:41.240 --> 41:43.117
-Thank you for coming.
-Thank you.

41:44.710 --> 41:46.359
There someplace we can talk?

41:50.090 --> 41:51.159
I'll see you later.

41:52.090 --> 41:53.455
Okay, follow me.

42:20.450 --> 42:21.485
Nothing.

42:32.880 --> 42:35.007
77juana s the top plaza in the federation.

42:35.800 --> 42:38.086
We have the best operations,
the best contacts.

42:38.470 --> 42:40.006
We work harder.

42:41.050 --> 42:44.508
Right now, Sinaloa moves 20, 30%
of their coke through Tijuana.

42:45.020 --> 42:46.840
Why shouldn't it be moved by my family?

42:47.940 --> 42:49.896
And what about Sinaloa?

42:49.980 --> 42:51.299
What about them?

42:54.230 --> 42:55.811
My family can handle more.

42:56.690 --> 42:58.100
My family wants more.

42:58.200 --> 42:59.406
We've earned it.

43:02.450 --> 43:03.986
Cash flow is down.

43:04.080 --> 43:05.365
Give us an opportunity.

43:11.460 --> 43:13.451
More money is coming, Benjamn.

43:17.460 --> 43:19.508
But, for now, things stay as they are.

43:19.930 --> 43:22.717
All we want is what's ours, Miguel ngel.

43:29.100 --> 43:31.091
What's yours is also mine, Benjamn.

43:33.400 --> 43:34.765
Don't forget that.

43:36.780 --> 43:39.271
Things stay as they are.

43:47.330 --> 43:49.036
You had a baby, right?

43:50.870 --> 43:51.859
A girl.

43:54.630 --> 43:56.951
Ruth. After her mother.

43:57.590 --> 43:59.046
That's a pretty name.

43:59.920 --> 44:01.171
Congratulations.

44:02.010 --> 44:03.580
It's a party.

44:03.890 --> 44:04.879
Come on.

44:04.970 --> 44:06.130
Enjoy it.

45:11.080 --> 45:13.401
-Car's pulling up.
-Rea|ly?

45:13.710 --> 45:15.530
-Yeah.
-Good.

45:17.210 --> 45:18.279
It's a nice party.

45:19.800 --> 45:22.963
Every one of these assholes
would put a bullet in my head

45:23.050 --> 45:24.460
if they could get away with it.

46:05.670 --> 46:06.716
Cheers!

46:08.010 --> 46:09.329
Thank you all!

46:16.770 --> 46:18.556
Who's the slick dude wearing silk?

46:18.900 --> 46:20.265
That's Pacho Herrera,

46:20.650 --> 46:21.890
one of the Cali guys.

46:22.860 --> 46:25.567
Probably came up here to show his respect.

46:25.650 --> 46:27.390
Hopefully he brought cash, no?

46:28.410 --> 46:29.900
Fucking Colombians.

46:40.040 --> 46:40.870
What's up?

46:42.800 --> 46:45.451
I hear there's a tiger at the party.

46:47.220 --> 46:48.756
I would like to touch it.

46:49.550 --> 46:51.427
Watch him eat something.

46:51.720 --> 46:52.755
Whatever.

46:55.350 --> 46:56.556
That's fine, man.

46:57.890 --> 46:59.551
Yeah, okay, it's out back.

47:01.860 --> 47:03.646
Excuse me. It was a pleasure.

47:17.540 --> 47:18.950
He's on the move.

47:48.530 --> 47:50.691
Thank you for coming.

47:52.870 --> 47:55.657
Means a lot that you made the trip here.

47:56.200 --> 47:57.235
That'll be all.

48:00.870 --> 48:02.781
I wanted to speak with you in person.

48:05.420 --> 48:06.626
About the business.

48:07.420 --> 48:09.001
Cheers.

48:11.680 --> 48:13.466
Some issues have come up.

48:14.890 --> 48:17.882
We have to adjust the terms
of our arrangement.

48:20.640 --> 48:22.847
$3000 a kilo is our number.

48:26.360 --> 48:28.646
I came all this way
so you could ask for a raise?

48:28.780 --> 48:30.270
It's not like that.

48:30.400 --> 48:32.448
No, that's not what I'm getting at.

48:32.530 --> 48:33.906
Please, sit.

48:38.490 --> 48:43.029
There's a more pressing issue.

48:46.210 --> 48:50.544
You see, we move your coke
over the border,

48:51.170 --> 48:54.719
deliver it to whatever warehouse you ask,

48:55.800 --> 48:56.960
and then we wait.

48:58.470 --> 49:00.802
For weeks, sometimes months.

49:02.730 --> 49:05.267
The money we're owed by you,
it's adding up.

49:08.440 --> 49:11.853
You haven't been working with coke
as long as us.

49:12.780 --> 49:15.442
Maybe you don't understand how it works.

49:16.410 --> 49:19.231
Product's easier to move than cash.

49:20.120 --> 49:22.998
Weighs less, packs tighter...

49:23.750 --> 49:26.457
Powder is fast, cash is slow.

49:27.250 --> 49:30.128
We always pay our bills, though.

49:30.630 --> 49:33.087
Yes, I understand.

49:34.970 --> 49:37.086
The thing is,

49:37.180 --> 49:40.638
your organization owes us
over $200 million.

49:41.220 --> 49:42.551
Is that a lot to you?

49:44.890 --> 49:45.970
For me, no.

49:48.400 --> 49:50.061
For my people, yes.

49:51.270 --> 49:53.682
See, I control a lot of plazas...

49:56.030 --> 49:57.907
and, right now, they're short.

49:59.700 --> 50:03.192
I've used my own money to keep them going.

50:07.210 --> 50:08.074
Look”.

50:08.880 --> 50:10.529
all the people you see out there...

50:11.210 --> 50:13.792
generals, governors...

50:14.460 --> 50:15.791
that's Mexico.

50:16.590 --> 50:18.751
The neighbors to your biggest customer.

50:22.100 --> 50:26.514
Don't get me wrong, I don't want to
disrupt what our organizations have built.

50:28.350 --> 50:31.683
But this debt I'm carrying,
it can't go on.

50:41.070 --> 50:43.482
You have a nice house, Miguel ngel.

50:45.250 --> 50:46.706
Filled with...

50:48.330 --> 50:49.991
nice-looking people.

50:51.130 --> 50:52.415
Important people.

50:54.420 --> 50:55.796
But I wonder...

50:58.380 --> 51:00.541
how many of them tell you the truth.

51:08.520 --> 51:10.090
I'm thinking none.

51:13.360 --> 51:16.989
So, let me do you the favor
of telling you the truth.

51:19.450 --> 51:24.899
Your organization has money trouble
because seizures are up over 40%.

51:25.870 --> 51:26.859
Why?

51:28.910 --> 51:33.745
Maybe because the DEA doubled its number
of agents in the last six months.

51:37.090 --> 51:38.910
Now, why would that be?

51:41.640 --> 51:44.541
Should I tell you, or have you guessed?

51:46.970 --> 51:50.679
The kidnapping and murder
of an American DEA agent.

51:51.350 --> 51:53.853
Which my partners and I
had nothing to do with.

51:55.320 --> 51:57.470
But if we were asked,

51:57.570 --> 52:00.312
we'd have told whoever came up
with the idea...

52:00.900 --> 52:03.448
to put a gun in their mouth
and pull the fucking trigger.

52:03.950 --> 52:06.692
'Cause that was bad for business.

52:12.540 --> 52:14.167
The consequences of that...

52:16.460 --> 52:18.041
are your problem.

52:20.800 --> 52:21.960
lVot ours.

52:25.180 --> 52:26.920
That's the truth, Miguel ngel.

52:30.100 --> 52:31.260
But, hey...

52:32.060 --> 52:36.269
if you're having trouble,
we can always send up more product.

52:36.980 --> 52:38.641
If you can handle it.

52:43.360 --> 52:44.770
Didn't think so.

52:46.700 --> 52:50.033
We'll continue to pay you
to transport our cocaine.

52:50.540 --> 52:53.111
In the exact same way we always have.

52:54.170 --> 52:55.626
And you'll get your money...

52:56.080 --> 52:57.240
when you get it.

53:00.630 --> 53:02.166
If that doesn't work for you,

53:03.340 --> 53:05.388
I'm sure we can figure something else out.

53:09.310 --> 53:12.473
And you can go back to doing
whatever it was you were doing

53:12.560 --> 53:14.801
before we made you rich.

53:21.610 --> 53:23.271
Happy Birthday, Miguel ngel.

53:24.650 --> 53:26.060
Many more.

54:00.690 --> 54:01.816
He's leaving already?

54:02.780 --> 54:03.815
What did he say?

54:05.610 --> 54:07.271
Told me that it's my problem.

54:12.700 --> 54:14.247
What about the money they owe us?

54:16.410 --> 54:18.537
When they get to it.

54:30.470 --> 54:34.304
Flix, at the rate we're going,
we won't last six months.

54:37.640 --> 54:38.720
You're right.

54:40.020 --> 54:41.226
We wouldn't.

54:43.020 --> 54:44.476
But it won't matter.

54:45.400 --> 54:48.779
In six months, I'll own the Colombians.

54:50.620 --> 54:53.236
Those bastards will work for me.

54:57.580 --> 54:59.571
I went on record tonight.

55:03.500 --> 55:05.707
I'm going away on business tomorrow.

55:07.380 --> 55:09.928
If it goes well,
I'll explain everything when I get back.

55:10.260 --> 55:11.887
What do I tell the plazas?

55:13.100 --> 55:15.307
They know you were talking to Pacho.

55:16.850 --> 55:18.841
Tell them everything is being handled.

56:13.320 --> 56:15.527
Son of a bitch.

56:27.920 --> 56:29.000
Move it, asshole!

56:30.340 --> 56:31.466
Move!

56:33.640 --> 56:36.291
-Move that piece of junk.
-I'm trying.

56:37.260 --> 56:39.091
Son of a bitch isn't working.

56:40.930 --> 56:42.636
What's this asshole doing?

56:43.140 --> 56:46.359
-I said move your shit--
-I'm checking it out really quick.

56:47.150 --> 56:48.390
It's not working.

56:51.070 --> 56:52.446
I don't see them, sir.

56:53.280 --> 56:54.486
Idiots.

56:55.450 --> 56:56.519
Keep going.

57:04.170 --> 57:06.536
You know what, asshole?
Close that shit, we're gonna push you.

57:06.630 --> 57:07.619
Okay.

57:08.750 --> 57:10.251
Let's push this idiot.

57:11.010 --> 57:14.969
See if we can move it.
All that cement's heaw.

57:15.050 --> 57:16.085
Move it, asshole.

57:25.560 --> 57:27.016
What is this shit?

57:50.670 --> 57:51.659
Go back.

57:55.840 --> 57:56.920
What the fuck?

57:57.970 --> 58:00.006
Move it, asshole! Move, idiot!

58:03.140 --> 58:05.347
-Out of the car!
-Shut it off!

58:05.440 --> 58:07.681

58:07.770 --> 58:10.102

Hear that?

58:18.160 --> 58:19.229

58:19.740 --> 58:20.695
Something's up.

58:20.780 --> 58:22.657

58:30.670 --> 58:33.127
Hey, I thought you were
going to help me push.

58:42.600 --> 58:43.919
They’re headed your way/ Copy?

59:21.180 --> 59:22.966
Sirens, boss!

1:00:51.270 --> 1:00:52.339
Please. No.

1:01:00.230 --> 1:01:01.231
Please.

1:01:07.160 --> 1:01:09.151
Please. I won't say a thing.

1:01:09.620 --> 1:01:10.439
Please.

1:01:23.340 --> 1:01:24.750
Take out your wallet.

1:01:27.050 --> 1:01:28.756
