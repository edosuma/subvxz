01:06.333 --> 01:10.567
I, Sophia Petrillo,
being of sound mind and body

01:11.066 --> 01:15.300
do hereby leave my daughter
Dorothy Zbornak,

01:16.433 --> 01:17.233
nothing!

01:20.166 --> 01:21.300
Sophia.

01:21.367 --> 01:22.266
It's a joke.

01:22.333 --> 01:25.066
I'm kidding like when I said,
"sound mind and body".

01:26.367 --> 01:29.200
Sophia, wills are no joking matter.

01:29.734 --> 01:33.166
Charlie tried to be funny with his
and left everything to Henrietta,

01:33.233 --> 01:34.734
our prize cow.

01:36.266 --> 01:41.200
Well, some lawyer got a hold of the will
and represented Henrietta on contingency.

01:43.100 --> 01:47.000
There I was presenting my side
to a jury of her peers.

01:48.867 --> 01:51.533
Took over six months to get the farm back.

01:53.133 --> 01:54.400
What a terrible story.

01:55.467 --> 01:57.700
I mean it, it's a terrible story.

01:58.867 --> 02:00.467
But you must have been relieved
when you won.

02:00.533 --> 02:04.800
Yeah, we celebrated
with a big thick steak.

02:08.600 --> 02:09.367
Hi, guys.

02:09.433 --> 02:11.233
Oh, Dorothy, I'm glad you're here.
Sit down.

02:11.300 --> 02:12.367
What is it, Ma?

02:12.433 --> 02:14.900
As you know, my child,
I'm getting on in years.

02:14.967 --> 02:17.600
And I decided it's time
for me to settle my estate.

02:17.667 --> 02:20.700
What estate?
Your luffa sponge and bus pass?

02:22.300 --> 02:24.100
Don't forget the four gold teeth

02:24.166 --> 02:25.734
when your father worked
at the funeral parlor.

02:27.433 --> 02:28.867
Perks, he called them.

02:29.333 --> 02:31.100
That's the stock you come from.

02:32.533 --> 02:34.800
I come from grave robbers?

02:35.533 --> 02:38.834
Grave robber, entrepreneur,
potato, potato.

02:38.900 --> 02:40.133
We had a family to feed.

02:42.333 --> 02:43.734
I hated that cow.

02:48.166 --> 02:51.033
I still don't think
she should have been awarded the car.

02:53.333 --> 02:54.834
Not that she got to use it.

02:54.900 --> 02:55.800
(laughs)

03:00.333 --> 03:01.166
Butt out.

03:01.233 --> 03:03.333
I'm having an important moment
with my heir.

03:03.400 --> 03:06.633
Dorothy, Rose is helping me
make out ironclad will.

03:06.700 --> 03:07.433
Wait.

03:07.500 --> 03:10.133
You're using Rose as a lawyer?

03:10.967 --> 03:12.800
I know what I'm doing.

03:12.867 --> 03:15.767
Every Thursday I watch <i>La Law.</i>

03:26.133 --> 03:28.100
That's <i>L.A. Law.</i>

03:29.033 --> 03:32.000
I wondered why Susan Day
didn't have a French accent.

03:35.700 --> 03:37.266
Girls, what am I gonna do?

03:37.333 --> 03:40.900
I got a call from a soldier
who just returned from the Persian Gulf.

03:40.967 --> 03:42.467
Don't fall for it, Blanche.

03:42.533 --> 03:45.266
Sal didn't come home
from world war 2 till 1951.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.200
Where was he stationed?

03:47.266 --> 03:48.266
In the attic.

03:49.967 --> 03:52.266
Ma, you told me he was in the arctic.

03:52.333 --> 03:55.433
That attic, the arctic, tomato, tamato.

03:56.834 --> 03:58.300
He had a family to feed.

03:59.066 --> 04:01.667
Well, anyway,
this soldier really did go to the war

04:01.734 --> 04:02.967
and he's gonna be here any minute.

04:03.033 --> 04:05.734
I don't know what to do
because I can't remember him.

04:05.800 --> 04:08.734
All he said on the phone
was he had a great time with me

04:08.800 --> 04:09.667
the night before he left.

04:09.734 --> 04:12.400
Then it's got to be anybody.

04:14.367 --> 04:15.100
(doorbell chimes)

04:15.166 --> 04:17.233
There's your unknown soldier.

04:17.300 --> 04:20.433
Dorothy, would you please get the door
and find out his name.

04:20.500 --> 04:23.767
What are you so worried about?
The minute you see him, you'll remember.

04:23.834 --> 04:26.233
Rose, he's gonna be standing up
with his clothes on.

04:29.667 --> 04:31.500
-He could be...
-Anybody.

04:32.567 --> 04:35.433
-Please, Dorothy.
-Oh, all right.

04:36.100 --> 04:37.600
-Can I come?
-Sure, Ma.

04:37.667 --> 04:39.166
Oh, boy, we're going to the living room.

04:40.867 --> 04:42.934
We don't have much of a life,
do we, Dorothy?

04:44.834 --> 04:47.767
Dorothy, now, remember be nice to him.

04:47.834 --> 04:49.934
He hasn't had sex in over a year.

04:51.867 --> 04:54.266
(laughs)
Look who I'm talking to.

05:03.066 --> 05:03.867
Hello.

05:04.633 --> 05:06.734
-Is Blanche here?
-Yes, she is.

05:06.800 --> 05:08.333
Whom shall I say is calling?

05:08.400 --> 05:10.533
This is kind of embarrassing.

05:10.600 --> 05:13.333
Would you mind telling her,
"Lover-boy is here"?

05:13.400 --> 05:16.300
(chuckles)
Nothing would give me greater pleasure.

05:17.934 --> 05:21.767
Ah, Blanche, Lover-boy is here.

05:23.033 --> 05:24.033
Blanche.

05:25.200 --> 05:26.467
Lover-boy.

05:31.300 --> 05:32.900
Not a clue.

05:36.667 --> 05:38.066
I just got off the plane.

05:38.133 --> 05:40.567
I haven't even been home yet
I just couldn't wait to see you.

05:40.633 --> 05:43.266
Lover-boy, that's so sweet.

05:43.333 --> 05:44.266
Lover-boy.

05:45.033 --> 05:47.033
All those months away I kept saying,

05:47.100 --> 05:49.367
"There's a great lady
waiting for you back home, Ken."

05:49.433 --> 05:50.266
Ken.

05:50.333 --> 05:52.934
That's it, of course. Ken.

05:53.567 --> 05:55.600
Then ken would turn to me and say,

05:56.900 --> 05:59.667
"There's a great lady
waiting for you too, Bill."

06:00.533 --> 06:01.266
Bill?

06:04.734 --> 06:06.600
Bill, he was talking to you?

06:06.667 --> 06:09.834
-Yes.
-Yes, of course. Darlings, this is Bill.

06:11.066 --> 06:13.967
Well, I guess Bill and I should be going.

06:14.600 --> 06:16.734
I thought we should go back
to that same place

06:16.800 --> 06:17.934
where we fell in love, Blanche.

06:18.000 --> 06:21.200
Yes, that's great. That'd be wonderful.

06:21.266 --> 06:23.567
Yes, we'll go right back to... there.

06:26.600 --> 06:29.166
We'll just do exactly the same things
we did that night.

06:29.967 --> 06:32.166
Oh, what a wonderful night that was.

06:32.233 --> 06:33.166
Bye, girls.

06:36.700 --> 06:38.100
Not a clue.

06:47.166 --> 06:48.633
Isn't this something, Blanche?

06:48.700 --> 06:50.900
Do you believe they gave us
the same table?

06:50.967 --> 06:52.800
Well, why would they seat us separately?

06:55.767 --> 06:58.367
I mean, the same table as last time.

06:58.433 --> 07:00.233
Oh, of course.

07:00.300 --> 07:01.467
Silly me.

07:01.533 --> 07:03.166
Oh, look, even the same chairs.

07:03.233 --> 07:04.000
(cackles)

07:04.066 --> 07:06.633
Blanche, I have a confession to make.

07:06.700 --> 07:07.567
It's not easy.

07:07.967 --> 07:10.667
But something happened over there
and I think you should know about it.

07:10.734 --> 07:14.433
Well, I did keep pretty well up
with what went on over there.

07:14.500 --> 07:17.233
I saw Schwarzkopf on the <i>Bob Hope Special.</i>

07:18.467 --> 07:21.300
What I'm talking about is personal,
Blanche.

07:22.033 --> 07:25.200
I know we said
we wouldn't even look at anybody else.

07:28.667 --> 07:32.300
But the first night the sirens went off,
I got scared

07:32.367 --> 07:34.400
and there was this nurse that I talked to.

07:34.867 --> 07:36.300
Oh, how could you, Ben?

07:36.367 --> 07:37.600
Mark... Bill.

07:40.800 --> 07:42.834
I swear it didn't mean a thing.

07:42.900 --> 07:44.300
Was she beautiful?

07:44.367 --> 07:45.633
Not as beautiful as you.

07:45.700 --> 07:49.734
Oh, well, I too have a confession to make.

07:51.233 --> 07:52.800
I got scared too.

07:55.567 --> 07:57.233
Three, four times a week.

08:02.400 --> 08:04.867
Depending upon how often the phone rang.

08:06.033 --> 08:09.000
You were scared they were calling
about me, weren't you?

08:09.467 --> 08:10.400
Yeah.

08:11.166 --> 08:12.967
Yeah, that's it. That's a good one.

08:13.600 --> 08:16.133
Well, if it weren't for your picture,

08:16.200 --> 08:17.934
I don't think
I would have made it through.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
My picture?

08:19.066 --> 08:20.567
You know, it sounds corny,

08:21.233 --> 08:25.667
but I put your picture in my locker
and I would look at it every day.

08:26.133 --> 08:30.266
You don't know how important it is
to know you've got somebody back home.

08:30.533 --> 08:34.266
Especially when you're thousands
of miles away in the middle of a war.

08:36.633 --> 08:38.934
You promised me, when I came back,

08:39.934 --> 08:42.166
I would be your one and only guy.

08:44.200 --> 08:46.767
(romantic music playing)

08:47.900 --> 08:48.567
Dance?

08:49.867 --> 08:50.767
Sure.

09:02.200 --> 09:03.800
Welcome home, soldier.

09:34.266 --> 09:37.000
Hey, Rose, it's late.
What are you doing up?

09:37.066 --> 09:39.467
I'm just cleaning up some things
on your mother's will.

09:39.533 --> 09:41.133
You mean the legal language?

09:41.200 --> 09:43.467
No, I spilled some sauce.

09:47.633 --> 09:49.266
Ma, what are you doing up?

09:49.834 --> 09:50.900
Disappointed, huh?

09:50.967 --> 09:52.567
If I'm up that means I'm alive.

09:52.633 --> 09:55.166
And if I'm alive it means
you can't get your hands on my money.

09:57.166 --> 09:58.700
What are you talking about?

09:58.767 --> 10:00.100
You know about the will.

10:00.166 --> 10:02.166
You know if I die,
you'll be on easy street.

10:02.233 --> 10:05.367
What did you do, Dorothy,
slip cyanide into my mouthwash?

10:05.433 --> 10:07.367
Ha, the jokes on you. I don't use it.

10:09.500 --> 10:12.300
Oh, Ma, come on, you're just being silly.

10:13.467 --> 10:15.500
Here, have some tea.

10:20.100 --> 10:21.633
It'll relax you.

10:27.667 --> 10:29.667
Nice try, Dorothy. Rose, you taste it.

10:31.300 --> 10:32.166
Rose, don't!

10:36.767 --> 10:38.800
That tea was for my mommy.

10:43.133 --> 10:44.900
You try to do right by your kids

10:44.967 --> 10:47.400
and you end up as the lead story
on hard copy.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.166
Do you have any idea
what she's talking about?

10:51.233 --> 10:53.367
Or do we have to up her medication?

10:54.467 --> 10:57.500
I do know what she's talking about
but I can't tell you.

10:57.567 --> 11:00.533
I couldn't violate
the attorney-client privilege.

11:00.600 --> 11:04.734
Especially when we're talking
about a sum as large as $35,000.

11:08.133 --> 11:11.100
$35,000.

11:11.166 --> 11:12.867
And four gold teeth.

11:15.767 --> 11:16.867
Oops.

11:17.500 --> 11:18.600
Nice going.

11:18.667 --> 11:20.500
Exactly how close to the television
are you sitting

11:20.567 --> 11:21.834
when you're watching <i>La Law</i>?

11:30.000 --> 11:34.000
All right, Ma, enough.
Now, where did you get $35,000?

11:34.066 --> 11:35.433
Did you ever hear of hard work?

11:35.867 --> 11:37.533
Your brother and sister
had to work very hard

11:37.600 --> 11:38.633
to send me that money.

11:40.467 --> 11:44.533
Are you telling me that all these years,
you were hoarding money

11:44.600 --> 11:47.600
while I had to make big huge sacrifices?

11:47.667 --> 11:49.333
I'm not telling you, you're guessing.

11:51.867 --> 11:54.266
But to be perfectly honest,
you're getting warmer.

11:55.800 --> 11:58.633
Oh, what a wonderful night.

12:01.767 --> 12:03.433
Now that Bill's getting out
of the service,

12:03.500 --> 12:05.333
we can build a life together.

12:05.800 --> 12:09.433
Maybe with a V-A loan,
we get a nice little house in the country

12:09.500 --> 12:12.133
with a dog, a cat, a station wagon.

12:12.700 --> 12:16.066
Blanche, you're talking like it's 1945.

12:17.867 --> 12:20.033
These aren't the best years of your life.

12:21.100 --> 12:23.767
These are the last years of your life.

12:26.166 --> 12:29.433
Dorothy, tonight when I was dancing
in his arms it hit me:

12:29.500 --> 12:33.633
one minute I was worried about my hair,
the next, I was in love.

12:34.166 --> 12:36.834
Bill is the most romantic man
I've ever known.

12:38.266 --> 12:40.433
She always says that
when they give her a hat.

12:46.567 --> 12:50.467
(upbeat music playing)

12:54.834 --> 12:55.834
Good morning, Dorothy.

12:55.900 --> 12:57.734
Don't start, Rose, okay?

12:57.800 --> 12:58.700
I'm sorry.

12:58.767 --> 13:01.100
That "good morning" crack
was way out of line.

13:01.900 --> 13:03.533
Oh, no, it's me.

13:04.033 --> 13:07.266
I was up all night thinking
of how Ma has been hoarding

13:07.333 --> 13:09.700
all those checks from Phil and Gloria

13:09.767 --> 13:11.400
while I've had to go without.

13:11.467 --> 13:14.934
Well, Dorothy, you really
can't blame Sophia for your sex life.

13:19.266 --> 13:21.266
That's not what I'm talking about.

13:21.633 --> 13:23.867
But since you brought it up, yes, I can.

13:24.500 --> 13:25.767
If I had the money,

13:25.834 --> 13:28.433
I could have been living
in a swinging condo instead of with...

13:29.000 --> 13:31.333
I better not say anything
until I've had my coffee.

13:32.400 --> 13:34.133
A slut and a moron.

13:41.567 --> 13:42.967
I'm sorry. It must be decaf.

13:46.300 --> 13:49.400
-Good morning, pussycat.
-What's so pussycat about it?

13:49.767 --> 13:52.300
Do you have any idea
how furious I am with you?

13:52.367 --> 13:57.200
All these years, I have given up things
so that you could have a decent life.

13:57.266 --> 13:59.533
No, Ma, I don't need new shoes.

13:59.600 --> 14:01.667
I want you to play bingo.

14:01.734 --> 14:04.200
No, ma, I don't need that vacation.

14:04.266 --> 14:06.433
You need new wallpaper.

14:06.500 --> 14:08.834
My car will last another year.

14:08.900 --> 14:11.867
All right, Dorothy,
I see behind that mask.

14:11.934 --> 14:12.967
You're angry.

14:14.100 --> 14:15.867
You're damn right I'm angry.

14:15.934 --> 14:18.000
You've been hoarding money
for the last 10 years

14:18.066 --> 14:19.300
and taking advantage of me.

14:19.367 --> 14:20.667
Of course, I'm angry.

14:20.734 --> 14:22.400
No, it's something else.

14:23.333 --> 14:26.300
I think you didn't get enough hugs
when you were a kid.

14:28.233 --> 14:29.400
It's payback time.

14:30.266 --> 14:31.800
Come here, pussycat.

14:33.033 --> 14:35.066
Why don't you hug your money, Ma?

14:35.133 --> 14:37.633
From now on, I'm not paying for anything.

14:37.700 --> 14:39.467
You are on your own.

14:39.533 --> 14:42.967
You can't do this to me.
You never touch the principle.

14:43.367 --> 14:45.200
That money's for my old age.

14:46.533 --> 14:47.967
Old age?

14:48.467 --> 14:50.934
You don't leave fingerprints anymore.

14:57.767 --> 14:59.967
I'm in my twilight years.

15:00.033 --> 15:02.000
You're in the twilight zone.

15:03.934 --> 15:06.867
Hopi Indians are walking around saying,
"How does she do it?"

15:08.633 --> 15:10.033
Ma, you're cut off.

15:18.300 --> 15:19.867
(doorbell chimes)

15:23.834 --> 15:25.400
I had to see you this morning.

15:25.467 --> 15:27.800
I just couldn't go to the drugstore
without giving you this.

15:27.867 --> 15:29.300
Oh, why, thank you.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.934
Why are you going to the drugstore?

15:32.000 --> 15:33.533
I'm your pharmacist.

15:34.433 --> 15:36.767
You're Bill. Bill the pharmacist.

15:36.834 --> 15:38.467
Bill, the man in your life.

15:38.533 --> 15:39.967
I'll pick you up after work.

15:40.033 --> 15:41.100
Goodbye, my love.

15:44.767 --> 15:45.934
(panting)

15:46.000 --> 15:46.700
Girls.

15:48.500 --> 15:49.600
Blanche, what's wrong?

15:49.667 --> 15:53.500
My handsome soldier from last night
is a pharmacist.

15:54.133 --> 15:57.500
A "name-tag wearing, pill counting,
thank you, come again,

15:57.567 --> 15:59.467
sorry, we don't validate" pharmacist.

16:00.367 --> 16:03.233
Well, if he doesn't validate,
get rid of him.

16:05.100 --> 16:07.166
Yeah, dump him, like you do all the rest.

16:07.233 --> 16:10.967
Well, ordinarily I would
but how can I do that?

16:11.033 --> 16:13.767
He's been dreaming of me for over a year.

16:13.834 --> 16:17.400
And I care about him, I mean,
I care about him when he's a soldier.

16:18.233 --> 16:21.000
Oh, I said things to him,
I've never said to anybody.

16:21.567 --> 16:22.633
Clean things.

16:24.767 --> 16:27.567
Oh, no, I can't dump this man.

16:27.633 --> 16:29.333
Not after what I've meant to him.

16:29.400 --> 16:31.600
Not after what he's done for his country.

16:32.834 --> 16:35.834
(somber music playing)

16:40.700 --> 16:42.934
Girls, how you think this sounds?

16:43.000 --> 16:46.266
"Dear Bill,
I always promised my father, Big Daddy,

16:46.333 --> 16:49.333
that I would never get serious
about anybody he didn't approve of.

16:49.400 --> 16:51.467
Since he is dead, I feel..."

16:51.533 --> 16:54.133
Oh, for God's sake, Blanche.

16:54.200 --> 16:57.667
Well, I guess I could always tell him,
he's too good for me.

16:57.734 --> 16:59.667
Sometimes the truth is best.

17:05.867 --> 17:08.266
Here you go.
Half butter pecan, half rocky road.

17:08.333 --> 17:10.767
-Just like you like it, Ma'am.
-Thank you, Sophia.

17:11.200 --> 17:12.600
(clears throat)

17:13.467 --> 17:15.233
Here, darling, that's for you.

17:15.567 --> 17:17.834
Wow, a whole dollar.

17:17.900 --> 17:20.867
Now, I can buy those knee-highs
I've been saving up for.

17:21.133 --> 17:23.033
Let me know if you have any more work,
Blanche.

17:23.500 --> 17:26.767
I may want you to take this letter
to the pharmacy and give it to Bill.

17:26.834 --> 17:30.200
Oh, Blanche,
you're not gonna send that letter.

17:30.266 --> 17:31.734
I mean, that's so cold.

17:31.800 --> 17:35.200
Don't you think you owe him
a face-to-face explanation?

17:35.266 --> 17:38.300
Good job, Dorothy,
cut off what little income I've got.

17:40.734 --> 17:44.000
Blanche, instead of sending the letter,
why don't you talk to him?

17:44.066 --> 17:45.400
I mean, get to know him.

17:45.467 --> 17:47.467
Find out where this goes.

17:47.533 --> 17:49.266
You know, ever since we've known you,

17:49.333 --> 17:53.333
you have never once worked
on having a meaningful relationship.

17:53.400 --> 17:55.800
I have had many meaningful relationships.

17:55.867 --> 17:58.867
Many, many, many,
meaningful relationships.

17:58.934 --> 18:02.867
Sharing a worm from a tequila bottle
is not meaningful.

18:05.000 --> 18:09.100
You find one little flaw in somebody
and you run away.

18:09.166 --> 18:10.567
A little flaw?

18:10.633 --> 18:12.900
He has skinny arms.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.266
How would you like to be made love to

18:15.333 --> 18:17.233
by somebody who has arms like your mother?

18:18.233 --> 18:21.800
My father made love to her
because of her inner beauty.

18:22.900 --> 18:24.433
He never saw me naked.

18:27.100 --> 18:29.300
I don't know, Dorothy, maybe you're right.

18:29.967 --> 18:32.600
I should try
to make this relationship work.

18:33.100 --> 18:35.767
(sighs)
Okay, I'm gonna go get prettied up

18:35.834 --> 18:39.900
and then I'm going down to the drugstore,
and get to know more about this man.

18:39.967 --> 18:44.066
You know, Bill's likes,
Bill's dislikes, Bill's last name.

18:51.100 --> 18:53.800
I used to put the Haley's MO
on the bottom.

18:53.867 --> 18:54.600
Nothing.

18:55.033 --> 18:56.500
Then I put it eye level.

18:56.800 --> 18:59.934
The public went nuts.
It was walking out of the store.

19:02.734 --> 19:05.033
People will bend for aspirins.

19:05.100 --> 19:07.066
They won't bend for laxatives.

19:08.266 --> 19:10.734
Isn't that fascinating, Bill.

19:10.800 --> 19:12.133
So, Bill, what's on sale?

19:12.934 --> 19:13.667
Breast pumps.

19:13.734 --> 19:14.467
What else?

19:15.433 --> 19:16.567
Afrosheen.

19:16.633 --> 19:17.433
Moving on.

19:18.700 --> 19:19.834
Preparation H.

19:19.900 --> 19:20.700
Hot damn.

19:24.700 --> 19:27.100
Isn't she awful?
(laughs)

19:27.166 --> 19:29.533
So, Bill, what other exciting things
can you tell me

19:29.600 --> 19:30.967
about the drugstore business?

19:31.033 --> 19:32.166
Blanche, we gotta talk.

19:32.734 --> 19:34.700
You know, the laxative thing?

19:34.767 --> 19:37.200
That's about as exciting as it gets.

19:37.266 --> 19:39.633
This place, my job, it's pretty routine.

19:39.700 --> 19:42.066
Oh, what are you talking about?
You're a hero.

19:42.133 --> 19:42.967
Over there.

19:43.033 --> 19:45.433
Over here, I'm just an ordinary guy.

19:45.500 --> 19:47.367
Señor Bill, por favor.

19:47.433 --> 19:49.700
(speaking Spanish)

19:49.767 --> 19:50.433
Excuse me.

19:51.066 --> 19:51.734
Here.

19:53.266 --> 19:55.734
You give your son this every four hours.

19:55.800 --> 19:59.767
And if his fever doesn't go down,
you take him to see Eldotor Segal

19:59.834 --> 20:01.400
at 11th and Lincoln.

20:01.467 --> 20:02.300
<i>Gracias.</i>

20:02.367 --> 20:03.333
<i>De nada.</i>

20:04.900 --> 20:07.500
Hey, who says you're not a hero?

20:09.734 --> 20:10.667
Welcome home.

20:12.500 --> 20:13.633
It is home, isn't it?

20:14.500 --> 20:16.500
Last night, I wasn't quite here yet.

20:17.333 --> 20:18.967
This morning was real.

20:19.033 --> 20:20.600
When I handed you that rose,

20:20.667 --> 20:23.266
I realized that I was standing
at a stranger's door.

20:23.934 --> 20:26.600
Because the truth is, I'm not a soldier.

20:26.900 --> 20:29.834
I'm a pharmacist in his fifties
and you're a woman in her--

20:29.900 --> 20:31.533
Watch it, Bill.

20:32.700 --> 20:33.467
(laughs)

20:34.800 --> 20:37.266
You're a woman in the prime of her life

20:37.333 --> 20:40.834
who I would like to get to know better,
slowly.

20:41.600 --> 20:43.800
And we can both see other people?

20:44.300 --> 20:45.133
Sure.

20:45.533 --> 20:47.900
(chuckles)

20:50.233 --> 20:54.033
Ah, sir, I caught this old lady
assaulting a man

20:54.100 --> 20:55.934
over the last tube of Preparation H.

20:59.633 --> 21:01.333
The tube broke and it's all over aisle 7.

21:01.400 --> 21:03.934
I detained her
for scooping up the rest of the ointment

21:04.000 --> 21:04.967
and putting it in her purse.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.800
Sophia!

21:07.867 --> 21:08.867
Oh, big deal.

21:08.934 --> 21:10.734
The other guy got away scot free.

21:10.800 --> 21:12.033
And he wriggled in it.

21:20.300 --> 21:23.033
Oh, Ma, I bought you a little something.

21:23.633 --> 21:24.500
You what?

21:24.567 --> 21:26.567
I bought you a new handbag

21:26.633 --> 21:29.266
to replace the one
that you ruined at the drugstore.

21:29.967 --> 21:31.533
Oh, thank God.

21:31.600 --> 21:34.100
The other one shrank down
to the size of a change purse.

21:36.166 --> 21:37.834
Wait a minute.

21:39.133 --> 21:40.033
What's the catch?

21:40.100 --> 21:42.066
Ma, there's no catch.

21:42.533 --> 21:45.467
I just realized,
I like taking care of you.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.233
I just wish you could have told me
about the money

21:48.300 --> 21:50.166
so we could be honest with each other.

21:50.233 --> 21:51.867
It's not that I want the money.

21:51.934 --> 21:54.633
If I don't leave my children anything,
I'm a nobody.

21:54.700 --> 21:57.266
How many times have I heard,
"He provided well"

21:57.333 --> 21:58.934
or "She didn't leave a dime"?

21:59.433 --> 22:03.166
I want you to be able to have everything
you want when I'm gone.

22:03.567 --> 22:08.000
And when you do, you'll think,
"I have this because of Ma".

22:08.467 --> 22:13.800
Oh, Ma, life isn't just valued
by the money you leave.

22:13.867 --> 22:16.567
It's the memories, the love.

22:17.100 --> 22:19.567
And you filled my life with that.

22:22.867 --> 22:24.000
You're right, pussycat.

22:24.066 --> 22:26.433
And I should want to see you
enjoy some of that money

22:26.500 --> 22:27.667
while I'm still around.

22:28.700 --> 22:29.467
Here's a molar.

22:31.033 --> 22:32.567
Buy yourself something pretty.

22:33.934 --> 22:35.367
That is so sweet.

22:35.934 --> 22:41.433
Ma, I'll tell you what,
let me make you a cup of tea.

22:46.567 --> 22:49.600
(quirky music playing)

22:56.266 --> 23:00.967
I, Sophia Petrillo, when I die,

23:01.033 --> 23:03.166
wanna be blown to a million, billion bits.

23:03.867 --> 23:07.433
(both laugh)

23:14.734 --> 23:19.367
I, Sophia Petrillo,
leave my daughter to science.

23:19.433 --> 23:22.667
(laughs)
