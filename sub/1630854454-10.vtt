00:01.610 --> 00:03.177
<i>Previously on</i> Alaska Daily...

00:03.177 --> 00:04.917
<i>Mr. Crenshaw.
You're being charged with</i>

00:04.917 --> 00:07.703
<i>murder in the first degree
in the death of Gloria Nanmac.</i>

00:07.703 --> 00:09.009
<i>The DNA
they found was semen.</i>

00:09.009 --> 00:10.662
Then the signed confession.

00:10.662 --> 00:13.317
So how did he plead not guilty
if he signed a confession?

00:13.317 --> 00:14.623
I need your story
on the arraignment

00:14.623 --> 00:17.147
- and the presser by 6:00.
- It's 4:30.

00:17.147 --> 00:19.367
You can do a Day Two tomorrow.
Keep going.

00:19.367 --> 00:21.412
<i>We've been pushing
this story uphill for months.</i>

00:21.412 --> 00:23.719
Now, suddenly,
it's rolling downhill fast.

00:23.719 --> 00:25.895
Did we just play a part
in the rush to judgment?

00:25.895 --> 00:28.028
<i>Conrad Pritchard
bought these parcels.</i>

00:28.028 --> 00:29.594
<i>He's building
a rare earths mine</i>

00:29.594 --> 00:30.813
<i>at Hockley Mountain?</i>

00:30.813 --> 00:32.249
We're planning to publish
tomorrow morning.

00:32.249 --> 00:33.294
Have we gone to him
for comment?

00:33.294 --> 00:34.773
Austin's headed
over there now.

00:34.773 --> 00:36.079
He's never gonna talk
to Austin.

00:36.079 --> 00:37.298
We still have
to report it.

00:37.298 --> 00:38.603
What the hell
did you do?

00:38.603 --> 00:40.518
You want a war?
You got one.

00:40.518 --> 00:41.867
Did you
sexually assault Gloria?

00:41.867 --> 00:43.130
I would never do that.

00:43.130 --> 00:45.132
- So, what happened?
- Gloria was mad.

00:45.132 --> 00:46.481
She called,
and I didn't pick up.

00:46.481 --> 00:48.439
There weren't any calls
placed from her phone

00:48.439 --> 00:49.484
the night
she went missing.

00:49.484 --> 00:50.963
She left a voicemail.

00:50.963 --> 00:53.314
<i>Toby.
I'm sorry for what I said.</i>

00:53.314 --> 00:54.706
<i>You know I love you.</i>

00:54.706 --> 00:55.925
<i>Please come get me.</i>

00:55.925 --> 00:57.100
This number,
the one she's calling from,

00:57.100 --> 00:58.754
that's not her number.

00:58.754 --> 01:00.277
Could belong to the person
who killed her.

01:04.542 --> 01:05.674
<i>What?</i>

01:07.154 --> 01:08.459
Eileen?

01:11.114 --> 01:12.376
What?

01:12.376 --> 01:14.074
What were you
thinking about?

01:14.074 --> 01:16.032
Oh.

01:16.032 --> 01:17.773
My colleague, Bob.

01:19.035 --> 01:22.082
The earnest one.

01:22.082 --> 01:23.866
Yeah.

01:23.866 --> 01:25.955
The earnest one.

01:25.955 --> 01:28.784
You said you enjoyed
provoking him.

01:28.784 --> 01:30.133
In a good-natured way.

01:30.133 --> 01:31.917
I believe I prefaced
my admission with that.

01:31.917 --> 01:33.093
You did, indeed.

01:34.964 --> 01:37.880
So what about Bob?

01:37.880 --> 01:40.317
His wife is sick,
and it's progressing quickly.

01:40.317 --> 01:42.711
Mm. And?

01:42.711 --> 01:44.408
I ran into him
in the bullpen yesterday.

01:44.408 --> 01:45.453
I asked him
how he was doing

01:45.453 --> 01:48.804
and he...
gave me a real answer.

01:48.804 --> 01:50.806
What did he say?

01:50.806 --> 01:52.112
He said he was
hanging in there,

01:52.112 --> 01:54.070
but it was
a very difficult time.

01:55.332 --> 01:57.073
So he told you the truth.

01:57.073 --> 01:58.944
He didn't cover.

01:58.944 --> 02:01.382
- Did that surprise you?
- No.

02:01.382 --> 02:03.645
But as a general rule,
I don't encourage people

02:03.645 --> 02:05.516
to share their burden
with me,

02:05.516 --> 02:07.997
especially people in pain.

02:09.041 --> 02:11.000
Because it makes you
uncomfortable?

02:11.000 --> 02:12.088
No, because I don't want them
to feel like

02:12.088 --> 02:14.395
they have to reciprocate
and ask me.

02:14.395 --> 02:16.614
- Are you in pain?
- That's not the point.

02:16.614 --> 02:18.007
What is the point?

02:19.139 --> 02:21.184
It was out of character
for me to even ask.

02:21.184 --> 02:22.968
I don't do that.

02:22.968 --> 02:24.318
Especially at work.

02:24.318 --> 02:26.537
Why do you think
you did that?

02:28.670 --> 02:30.759
I don't know.

02:30.759 --> 02:34.763
Maybe I'm still sideways
from being held hostage.

02:34.763 --> 02:37.853
Or maybe, intentionally or not,
you did want him

02:37.853 --> 02:40.682
to reciprocate and ask you
how you were doing.

02:40.682 --> 02:41.726
Yeah,
I don't think so.

02:41.726 --> 02:43.772
Like I said,
that's not like me.

02:45.208 --> 02:47.079
People change.

02:47.079 --> 02:50.387
Well, have you had
any panic attacks lately?

02:53.564 --> 02:55.653
No. I haven't.

03:07.143 --> 03:09.537
We listened to Gloria's
voicemail on your phone.

03:09.537 --> 03:10.886
She called from
a different number

03:10.886 --> 03:12.540
than the one
Sylvie gave us.

03:14.194 --> 03:16.718
Do you know
whose number this is?

03:18.807 --> 03:21.026
It was hers.

03:21.026 --> 03:22.158
Her other phone.

03:22.158 --> 03:24.160
Sylvie was getting in
her business.

03:24.160 --> 03:27.032
She didn't want her
to call me.

03:27.032 --> 03:28.947
So she got
a pay-as-you-go phone.

03:28.947 --> 03:31.472
She had it for a few weeks
before she died.

03:31.472 --> 03:34.431
There's no record of this
number in the police report.

03:34.431 --> 03:35.954
Well, it's hers.

03:35.954 --> 03:37.173
It was hers.

03:37.173 --> 03:38.218
Mm.

03:39.741 --> 03:40.916
You okay?

03:40.916 --> 03:42.265
It sucks in here.

03:43.658 --> 03:44.833
I hate it.

03:44.833 --> 03:47.444
My Change of Plea hearing
is next week.

03:47.444 --> 03:50.012
I thought I could just plead
guilty and that would be it.

03:50.012 --> 03:51.840
But Jimmy says
I have to tell the judge

03:51.840 --> 03:55.104
that I raped Gloria
and that I beat her to death.

03:55.104 --> 03:57.106
It's called
an allocution.

03:57.106 --> 03:59.674
Makes it really hard to claim
your innocence later.

03:59.674 --> 04:01.371
I never hurt her.

04:03.068 --> 04:05.288
But I can't get the deal
unless I say I did.

04:06.333 --> 04:07.899
That's messed up.

04:07.899 --> 04:09.510
Yeah.

04:09.510 --> 04:10.728
It is.

04:10.728 --> 04:12.295
You believe me, right?

04:12.295 --> 04:16.081
We're doing everything we can
to find the truth.

04:16.081 --> 04:18.649
I just told you the truth.

04:18.649 --> 04:23.045
Claire, did you write that piece
on the weeping spruce blight

04:23.045 --> 04:24.525
- a couple of years ago?
- I did.

04:24.525 --> 04:27.528
Uh, March, I think, 2018.
Why?

04:27.528 --> 04:30.748
Our big blue spruce seems
to have contracted the blight.

04:30.748 --> 04:33.273
The one in your backyard?
Too bad.

04:33.273 --> 04:34.839
My parents lost one
of their spruces,

04:34.839 --> 04:37.233
but they saved the other one
with a fungicide.

04:37.233 --> 04:38.930
If you need a rec,
let me know.

04:38.930 --> 04:41.716
A gang of yellow-rumped warblers
hangs out in our spruce.

04:41.716 --> 04:44.675
Colleen says
the fungicide'll poison them.

04:44.675 --> 04:46.155
I'm inclined to save the tree.

04:46.155 --> 04:48.375
Flora or fauna.
It's a Sophie's choice.

04:48.375 --> 04:50.333
- I've never seen that movie.
- It's a riot.

04:50.333 --> 04:52.727
If I remember correctly,
weeping spruce blight

04:52.727 --> 04:54.903
is caused
by a non-native species.

04:54.903 --> 04:58.341
Non-native species.
The root problems of all Alaska.

04:58.341 --> 05:00.561
Roz Friendly,
ladies and gentlemen.

05:00.561 --> 05:02.432
To be fair,
we were talking flora.

05:02.432 --> 05:03.477
The fact still remains,
doesn't it?

05:03.477 --> 05:04.695
Roz, coming in hot.

05:04.695 --> 05:06.349
Whoa, is the copier fixed?

05:06.349 --> 05:08.525
It is, in fact, working.

05:08.525 --> 05:09.918
That's excellent.

05:09.918 --> 05:12.137
But I used the last toner
cartridge printing these.

05:12.137 --> 05:14.139
- That's un-excellent.
- Yeah.

05:14.139 --> 05:17.839
Jindaháa and I are doing
the MMIW database together.

05:17.839 --> 05:19.144
Hey.

05:22.060 --> 05:24.628
Yeah, so, these are the calls
I transcribed off the tip line.

05:24.628 --> 05:27.022
These are articles
the paper ran about MMIW

05:27.022 --> 05:28.415
over the past 15 years.

05:28.415 --> 05:30.417
These are cases
I pulled off of CourtView.

05:30.417 --> 05:32.419
And all these boxes
came to us from JCAN.

05:32.419 --> 05:34.203
Alberta dropped them
off yesterday.

05:34.203 --> 05:36.379
How much have you entered
into the spreadsheet already?

05:36.379 --> 05:38.903
About this much.

05:40.122 --> 05:43.125
- We're gonna need some help.
- Yeah. Lots.

05:43.125 --> 05:44.996
All right, so, uh,
Teletrove says

05:44.996 --> 05:46.781
Gloria's burner
was bought with cash

05:46.781 --> 05:47.956
and it wasn't registered.

05:47.956 --> 05:49.479
Since there's no name attached,

05:49.479 --> 05:51.481
they won't turn over records
to Sylvie as next-of-kin.

05:51.481 --> 05:53.353
What about you?

05:53.353 --> 05:55.398
I can't stop listening
to her voicemail.

05:55.398 --> 05:57.444
Gloria tells Toby
that she loves him.

05:57.444 --> 05:58.575
That doesn't sound
like a woman

05:58.575 --> 06:00.360
reaching out to a man
who raped her.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.883
And then there's
the other voices.

06:01.883 --> 06:03.406
Other voices?

06:03.406 --> 06:05.669
It's faint, but you can hear men
talking in the background.

06:06.322 --> 06:07.715
<i>Toby, answer your phone.</i>

06:07.715 --> 06:09.456
Can't make out

06:09.456 --> 06:10.631
what they're saying,
but we need to know

06:10.631 --> 06:11.936
- who they are.
<i>- I'm sorry</i>

06:11.936 --> 06:13.547
<i>- for what I said.</i>
- Assuming it's not Toby.

06:13.547 --> 06:14.809
<i>- You know I love you.</i>
- We need a tech nerd.

06:14.809 --> 06:16.332
<i>- This place is bad.</i>
- I got a guy.

06:16.332 --> 06:18.247
You do? In house?

06:18.247 --> 06:19.291
No, strip mall.

06:20.467 --> 06:22.643
A sound guy in this--
this strip mall?

06:22.643 --> 06:25.123
Yeah, Al.
He owns Al's Dank Buds.

06:25.123 --> 06:27.691
Oh, this I gotta see.

06:27.691 --> 06:31.434
Zach's entire extended family
is in Chicago.

06:31.434 --> 06:34.698
He'll have grandparents,
aunts, uncles,

06:34.698 --> 06:36.831
cousins his own age
to play with.

06:36.831 --> 06:38.267
But he won't have
his father.

06:38.267 --> 06:40.225
Ah, he'll come for a stretch
in the summer.

06:40.225 --> 06:41.705
A stretch?

06:42.489 --> 06:45.927
This job will allow me to
pay for a better life--

06:45.927 --> 06:48.712
private school,
plus savings for college.

06:48.712 --> 06:50.453
A-- A house with a pool.

06:50.453 --> 06:51.802
You know he's always
wanted that.

06:51.802 --> 06:53.064
You've always wanted that.

06:53.064 --> 06:55.589
He has a great life here.
He loves his school.

06:55.589 --> 06:58.156
You wanna rip him away
from all his friends?

06:58.156 --> 06:59.419
Soccer, hockey?

06:59.419 --> 07:00.985
They have those in Chicago,
and at least

07:00.985 --> 07:03.292
I'll be able to provide him
with a safe environment.

07:03.292 --> 07:04.598
What the hell
does that mean?

07:04.598 --> 07:06.513
Okay, let's keep it respectful.

07:06.513 --> 07:07.818
Every time you have him,

07:07.818 --> 07:09.341
you end up bringing him
to that newsroom...

07:09.341 --> 07:10.430
He loves that newsroom.

07:10.430 --> 07:12.344
...where an armed gunman recently

07:12.344 --> 07:14.172
held one of
your colleagues hostage.

07:14.172 --> 07:16.000
What kind of place
is that for a child?

07:16.784 --> 07:18.046
Are you kidding?

07:23.486 --> 07:24.574
We have a custody agreement.

07:24.574 --> 07:26.837
You do.

07:26.837 --> 07:29.840
But if we can't
come to a compromise here,

07:29.840 --> 07:31.886
it'll go back to the court.

07:31.886 --> 07:34.802
And we all agreed we're trying
to avoid that, right?

07:37.152 --> 07:38.980
First time I've been in here.

07:38.980 --> 07:40.895
Yeah, not me.

07:44.376 --> 07:46.074
Hey, look at this.

07:46.074 --> 07:47.641
Matanuska Thunderfunk.

07:47.641 --> 07:49.947
- How good is this guy?
- Good.

07:49.947 --> 07:51.079
Weed's his business,

07:51.079 --> 07:53.168
but this guy's
a next-level audiophile.

07:53.168 --> 07:56.606
I used him to dig out
a bad recording a few years ago.

07:56.606 --> 07:57.825
Groovy.

07:57.825 --> 08:00.131
Roz! Come on back.

08:02.177 --> 08:03.308
Who's she?

08:03.308 --> 08:04.745
I'm Eileen.
We're partners.

08:04.745 --> 08:06.268
- Hi, Al.
- Hi, Eileen.

08:06.268 --> 08:07.399
- Any luck?
- Yeah.

08:07.399 --> 08:09.097
I tried to filter out
Gloria's voice

08:09.097 --> 08:10.577
and amplify the background.

08:10.577 --> 08:12.579
I also reduced
the low frequencies.

08:12.579 --> 08:14.494
They were distorting.

08:14.494 --> 08:16.147
Anyway, take a listen.

08:20.195 --> 08:21.544
Daddy, I wanna go.

08:21.544 --> 08:23.154
Is that a kid?

08:26.636 --> 08:28.682
<i>Daddy, I wanna go.</i>

08:28.682 --> 08:30.379
That's a kid.

08:30.379 --> 08:33.469
I can put an audio file of this
on your phone.

08:33.469 --> 08:35.471
Ezra Fisher
said he left Skeeter's

08:35.471 --> 08:38.082
to go get his son that night,
but never went back.

08:38.082 --> 08:39.693
If we can confirm that
that's his kid,

08:39.693 --> 08:41.172
then he didn't leave
before Gloria.

08:41.172 --> 08:42.739
And he loses his alibi.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.267
- Hey, Bob.
- Hey.

08:49.267 --> 08:51.792
Stanley said you have a contact
at Teletrove Cellular.

08:51.792 --> 08:54.708
Yeah, my buddy Gary
is VP of Public Relations.

08:54.708 --> 08:56.274
We founded
the home brew collective

08:56.274 --> 08:57.711
you've heard me
reference--

08:57.711 --> 08:59.321
Anchorage Yeasty Boys.

08:59.321 --> 09:00.888
Yeah. Cool.

09:00.888 --> 09:03.194
Uh, do you think that Gary
could help us track down

09:03.194 --> 09:04.413
the records
for this number?

09:04.413 --> 09:06.154
It was Gloria Nanmac's.

09:06.850 --> 09:07.851
Happy to ask him.

09:07.851 --> 09:10.288
Cheers.
Appreciate it.

09:18.862 --> 09:20.908
Taylor, I just have a few
questions. It won't take long.

09:20.908 --> 09:22.126
I don't want to talk
to you.

09:22.126 --> 09:23.475
Then don't.
Just listen.

09:24.651 --> 09:26.827
- You're gonna want to hear this.
- What?

09:26.827 --> 09:28.132
A voicemail
Gloria Nanmac left

09:28.132 --> 09:30.744
on someone's phone
the night she died.

09:30.744 --> 09:33.268
She was calling from
this drug dealer's house--

09:33.268 --> 09:34.399
Skeeter Redding.

09:36.793 --> 09:39.317
<i>Daddy, I wanna go.</i>

09:40.536 --> 09:42.451
Is that Jackson?

09:42.451 --> 09:44.801
Because if it is,
I'd like to talk to him.

09:44.801 --> 09:46.716
You're not
talking to my son.

09:46.716 --> 09:48.196
He's 10. No way.

09:48.196 --> 09:50.415
Taylor, please.
If he was there--

09:50.415 --> 09:52.069
He's got nothing to do
with this.

09:52.069 --> 09:54.463
You show up again,
I call the cops.

09:54.463 --> 09:55.943
Then can you at least
tell me where Ezra is?

09:55.943 --> 09:59.294
Yeah, I can.

09:59.294 --> 10:01.557
Because I have to see him
twice a week,

10:01.557 --> 10:03.298
because I don't
have full custody.

10:03.298 --> 10:05.082
Because my case fell apart
after your article

10:05.082 --> 10:06.736
took down my prosecutor.

10:06.736 --> 10:09.826
Taylor,
I know this sucks,

10:09.826 --> 10:12.307
but I don't want an innocent guy
to go to jail.

10:14.352 --> 10:16.441
He just got back into town.

10:16.441 --> 10:20.968
He's laying fiber-optic cable
over on Spenard.

10:20.968 --> 10:22.839
Now unless you want to lose it,
get your foot out of my door.

10:35.547 --> 10:38.768
Bunny, you're with me
coding the ontology.

10:38.768 --> 10:40.988
You have
the conceptual schema?

10:40.988 --> 10:43.033
It's mapped, but I'm still
building the engine.

10:43.033 --> 10:44.513
Erica, Trudy,
you're both in charge

10:44.513 --> 10:45.949
of the graphical
user interface.

10:45.949 --> 10:48.996
Marsha, you and I
are doing data filing.

10:48.996 --> 10:51.433
Our goal is a working beta
to demo by this weekend.

10:51.433 --> 10:52.652
Seriously?

10:52.652 --> 10:53.827
We don't need full functionality,

10:53.827 --> 10:55.437
- just proof of concept.
- We can do it.

10:55.437 --> 10:56.612
It's gonna
take a few days.

10:56.612 --> 10:58.005
We have a few days.
And food.

10:58.005 --> 10:59.963
- And coffee.
- Life's essentials.

10:59.963 --> 11:01.704
But we'll need to stay
on this 'round the clock.

11:01.704 --> 11:03.053
- Any conflicts?
- Well, I have

11:03.053 --> 11:04.185
my parameterized model

11:04.185 --> 11:05.969
of sea-ice dynamics
due in two days.

11:05.969 --> 11:07.318
What's that,
and due to who?

11:07.318 --> 11:09.233
Well, it's a model
that hindcasts and forecasts

11:09.233 --> 11:11.366
sea-ice dynamics based on
varying climate conditions,

11:11.366 --> 11:14.238
- and it's due to NASA.
- Wow.

11:14.238 --> 11:16.414
- So you're that kind of smart.
- JINDAHAÁA: She is.

11:16.414 --> 11:17.589
- Can you do both?
- Yeah.

11:17.589 --> 11:19.896
I-I just wanted
to be transparent.

11:19.896 --> 11:21.506
Well, thank you so much
for being here.

11:21.506 --> 11:22.986
All of you, really.

11:22.986 --> 11:26.294
This is very important,
and it's so helpful.

11:26.294 --> 11:28.513
And the clock is ticking,
so let's go.

11:32.213 --> 11:35.129
Taylor listened to it.
She recognized her kid's voice.

11:35.129 --> 11:36.913
<i>So Ezra lied
about leaving Skeeter's</i>

11:36.913 --> 11:38.741
<i>to pick up his kid?</i>

11:38.741 --> 11:40.700
<i>Yeah. And Jackson was
with him, which is screwed up.</i>

11:40.700 --> 11:43.441
<i>Sounds like he got back into
town and is working on Spenard.</i>

11:43.441 --> 11:44.747
<i>I'm gonna try
and track him down.</i>

11:44.747 --> 11:46.096
Back in town from where?

11:46.096 --> 11:48.533
Whatever village
he was working in. Why?

11:48.533 --> 11:51.972
W-- He was in Meade for work
when Gloria disappeared, right?

11:51.972 --> 11:54.235
- Installing high-speed Internet?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

11:54.235 --> 11:55.758
And he's been all over
the state for the job,

11:55.758 --> 11:58.065
laying cables in lots of
different villages, right?

11:58.065 --> 11:59.719
Right. Yeah.

11:59.719 --> 12:01.242
So we find out
where he was when--

12:01.242 --> 12:02.678
See if he hurt anyone else.

12:02.678 --> 12:03.897
<i>Try to establish a pattern.</i>

12:03.897 --> 12:05.246
Talk later.

12:05.246 --> 12:07.204
- Hey, Austin.
- What's up?

12:07.204 --> 12:08.902
Need a favor.

12:08.902 --> 12:11.295
Can you pull the stories you've
written about Denali Broadband

12:11.295 --> 12:12.906
installing Internet service
across the state?

12:12.906 --> 12:14.734
Sure.
For the Nanmac story?

12:14.734 --> 12:16.387
Yeah. We're trying to track
the movements of a guy

12:16.387 --> 12:18.041
we think
might be involved.

12:18.041 --> 12:19.782
Okay. The articles don't usually
mention the names

12:19.782 --> 12:21.088
of the workers.

12:21.088 --> 12:22.437
We're just
looking for the dates

12:22.437 --> 12:24.613
that Denali hired workers
in various villages.

12:24.613 --> 12:26.397
- Hard copies please?
- Uh, printer's down,

12:26.397 --> 12:28.486
but I'll pull clips
from the archive.

12:29.618 --> 12:32.012
Eileen, I heard back
from my source at Teletrove.

12:32.012 --> 12:33.796
He said the records
are confidential.

12:33.796 --> 12:35.667
Without a court order,
he can't share them.

12:35.667 --> 12:36.799
Sorry.

12:36.799 --> 12:38.366
Maybe take another run
at him.

12:38.366 --> 12:40.585
His answer was pretty firm.

12:40.585 --> 12:43.110
Well, no is easier
than yes, right?

12:43.110 --> 12:45.547
Give him another push.
It's important.

12:47.723 --> 12:50.770
Hey.

12:50.770 --> 12:53.468
How did your custody
mediation thing go this morning?

12:54.861 --> 12:56.601
Wonderful.
Smiles all around.

12:56.601 --> 12:59.822
- That bad?
- Yeah, kinda intense.

12:59.822 --> 13:02.477
- Got in my head.
- How so?

13:02.477 --> 13:04.218
I'm starting to wonder
if maybe she's right.

13:04.218 --> 13:06.916
Maybe Zach would be better off
in Chicago.

13:08.352 --> 13:10.398
More family.
More opportunities.

13:10.398 --> 13:12.617
He seems like
a happy kid to me.

13:12.617 --> 13:14.054
I know, right?

13:14.054 --> 13:15.664
I mean, he is happy.

13:17.231 --> 13:19.146
But he would be close
to cousins.

13:19.146 --> 13:22.845
Doesn't have any here.
I mean, am I being selfish?

13:22.845 --> 13:26.370
For not wanting to uproot Zach
so your ex can get a better job?

13:26.370 --> 13:27.850
No.

13:27.850 --> 13:29.417
Okay, stop beating
around the bush.

13:29.417 --> 13:30.679
Tell me
what you really think.

13:30.679 --> 13:31.941
I will.

13:31.941 --> 13:34.509
Always.

13:35.902 --> 13:37.033
Okay, this might not be appropriate

13:37.033 --> 13:39.644
to say in the morgue,
but that's hot.

13:42.560 --> 13:43.823
Oh, yeah?

13:45.389 --> 13:47.261
You deserve better.

13:47.261 --> 13:48.958
Do I?

13:48.958 --> 13:51.091
Because I don't think--
I don't-- It doesn't--

13:59.969 --> 14:02.972
Okay.

14:02.972 --> 14:04.844
You know
I don't want to stop.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.106
No.

14:06.106 --> 14:09.544
To say it, as long as
I've been thinking about

14:09.544 --> 14:11.807
what kissing you
would be like,

14:11.807 --> 14:14.027
the kiss exceeded
my imagination.

14:14.027 --> 14:16.638
I mean, expectations can
really bite you in the--

14:22.252 --> 14:23.906
Were you trying
to shut me up?

14:23.906 --> 14:27.040
There were just a lot of words
falling out of your mouth.

14:27.040 --> 14:28.171
You're a good person.

14:28.171 --> 14:30.782
I know.

14:31.740 --> 14:33.611
To be continued.

14:39.530 --> 14:41.097
What?

14:47.582 --> 14:49.976
Ezra Fisher?

14:49.976 --> 14:51.934
Do you remember me?

14:51.934 --> 14:54.067
Are you kidding?

14:54.067 --> 14:57.157
You took down Adam Barnett.
You're my hero.

14:57.157 --> 14:58.985
I'll buy you
a drink anytime.

14:58.985 --> 15:02.553
Maybe a rain check, but I got
a couple questions for you.

15:02.553 --> 15:04.207
About what?

15:04.207 --> 15:05.948
Do you remember that case
I asked you about?

15:05.948 --> 15:07.645
Gloria Nanmac?

15:07.645 --> 15:10.039
They found her killer.

15:12.694 --> 15:14.609
Oh, yeah?

15:14.609 --> 15:15.958
Yeah, an ex-boyfriend.

15:15.958 --> 15:18.830
Guy named Toby Crenshaw.

15:18.830 --> 15:20.615
He confessed.

15:20.615 --> 15:23.009
I think I read
something about that.

15:23.009 --> 15:24.924
Took 'em long enough.

15:24.924 --> 15:28.840
We're doing one last story
on her just to wrap things up.

15:31.365 --> 15:33.715
You said you saw Gloria
that night at Skeeter's,

15:33.715 --> 15:36.631
but you left before her
to go get your kid, right?

15:36.631 --> 15:38.415
Yeah, that's right.

15:38.415 --> 15:39.939
I had to pick him up
from the sitter.

15:39.939 --> 15:42.767
And you never went back?

15:42.767 --> 15:44.682
You never saw her again
after that?

15:44.682 --> 15:47.729
Yeah.
No, never saw her.

15:47.729 --> 15:49.992
S'too bad.

15:49.992 --> 15:53.300
Maybe you can clear
something up for us.

15:53.300 --> 15:55.389
Gloria left a voicemail
for a friend

15:55.389 --> 15:57.130
at Skeeter's that night.

15:59.175 --> 16:01.786
A kid's voice
is in the background.

16:04.093 --> 16:06.226
<i>Daddy, I wanna go.</i>

16:07.618 --> 16:10.578
That's Jackson, your son.

16:10.578 --> 16:12.275
Taylor confirmed it.

16:15.148 --> 16:18.542
Why don't you tell me
what you really did that night?

16:21.023 --> 16:23.504
You're not a cop.

16:23.504 --> 16:25.593
I don't have to talk to you.

16:43.263 --> 16:45.134
Hey.

16:45.134 --> 16:46.353
Yeah, hey.

16:47.615 --> 16:49.791
I found what
you're looking for.

16:49.791 --> 16:51.532
Over the past 10 years,
Denali Broadband

16:51.532 --> 16:54.970
has installed service in
27 villages across the state.

16:54.970 --> 16:56.972
Thanks. Uh, so we call
the police department

16:56.972 --> 16:58.669
and see if there were
any complaints against Ezra.

16:58.669 --> 17:00.802
A lot of those villages
don't have police departments.

17:00.802 --> 17:02.586
- What do you mean?
- He means exactly that.

17:02.586 --> 17:04.501
One in three villages
don't have cops.

17:04.501 --> 17:06.764
- That's insane.
- We call it Alaska.

17:06.764 --> 17:08.244
If they're lucky,
they'll have a VPO.

17:08.244 --> 17:10.638
- What's a VPO?
- Village Police Officer.

17:10.638 --> 17:12.814
- Usually an underpaid...
- And undertrained.

17:12.814 --> 17:14.033
...member of the community.

17:14.033 --> 17:17.123
So, can we get in touch
with these VPOs?

17:17.123 --> 17:19.908
Yeah, probably.
We can call the village stores.

17:19.908 --> 17:21.953
VPOs generally post
their phone number there.

17:21.953 --> 17:25.000
Going deep. Good luck.

17:27.046 --> 17:29.787
Doris Peal? Roz Friendly with
<i>The Daily Alaskan.</i>

17:29.787 --> 17:31.789
Wondering if you ever
dealt with Ezra Fisher

17:31.789 --> 17:33.878
between April and July 2016?

17:33.878 --> 17:36.490
That's right-- Ezra Fisher.

17:36.490 --> 17:37.708
Are you sure
it doesn't ring a bell?

17:37.708 --> 17:40.233
No, not Evan Kirshel.
Ezra Fisher.

17:40.233 --> 17:42.583
Yeah, he worked
for Denali Broadband.

17:42.583 --> 17:44.933
- Would've been in Nikolai...
- You just started as VPO.

17:44.933 --> 17:47.240
Did the old VPO
keep any records?

17:49.242 --> 17:52.114
- You sure?
- Thank you.

17:52.114 --> 17:54.290
We still got

17:54.290 --> 17:56.423
12 villages to call.

17:56.423 --> 17:58.686
It's a long shot,
but maybe we'll get a hit.

18:03.604 --> 18:05.432
Eileen Fitzgerald.

18:05.432 --> 18:09.000
<i>Eileen, this is Andy Ward
from</i> The New York Times.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.264
<i>- Good time to talk?</i>
- Sure.

18:11.264 --> 18:13.527
Uh, Andy,
just give me a second.

18:13.527 --> 18:16.051
I'm, uh, gonna go
grab a coffee.

18:16.051 --> 18:17.618
Do you want one?

18:17.618 --> 18:18.749
I'm good.

18:18.749 --> 18:20.621
What can I do for you,
Andy?

18:20.621 --> 18:22.057
<i>Well, I've been
following the work</i>

18:22.057 --> 18:23.406
<i>you've been doing
up there in Alaska.</i>

18:23.406 --> 18:25.191
<i>- It's damn good.</i>
- Thanks.

18:25.191 --> 18:28.542
We were all horrified by what
happened to you, by the way.

18:28.542 --> 18:30.370
I'm sure you read
Bret Stephen's opinion piece

18:30.370 --> 18:32.633
on violence
against journalists.

18:32.633 --> 18:34.461
<i>I did.
I sent him an e-mail.</i>

18:34.461 --> 18:36.289
Oh. Hopefully
<i>The Daily Alaskan</i>

18:36.289 --> 18:38.160
has beefed up
their security system.

18:38.160 --> 18:39.857
A little,
but they don't really have

18:39.857 --> 18:41.555
the budget
for that kind of thing.

18:41.555 --> 18:43.557
<i>Not surprising,
given the economic realities</i>

18:43.557 --> 18:45.167
<i>of small city papers
these days.</i>

18:45.167 --> 18:47.082
Which brings me
to my point.

18:47.082 --> 18:49.215
We'd like to offer you
a job here at <i>The Times.</i>

18:51.391 --> 18:52.740
Is that right?

18:52.740 --> 18:54.872
<i>You belong
in New York, Eileen.</i>

18:54.872 --> 18:56.787
Have you checked in
with New York about that?

18:56.787 --> 18:58.746
I have.

18:58.746 --> 19:01.618
And, uh, to be honest,
I feel like Rushmi

19:01.618 --> 19:04.404
let you down at <i>The Vanguard,</i>
not the other way around.

19:04.404 --> 19:06.188
<i>That never would have
happened here at</i> The Times.

19:06.188 --> 19:07.537
<i>We would've been way
ahead of it.</i>

19:07.537 --> 19:09.409
You belong on this stage.

19:09.409 --> 19:11.280
<i>I appreciate that, really.</i>

19:11.280 --> 19:14.979
But I'm-- I'm deep in a story
I really care about here.

19:14.979 --> 19:17.330
And the editor, he gave me
a shot when no one else would.

19:17.330 --> 19:19.419
Stanley Cornik, yeah.

19:19.419 --> 19:21.551
Yeah, he's good.
A pro.

19:21.551 --> 19:23.771
But all due respect,

19:23.771 --> 19:25.381
how much longer is he gonna
be doing it?

19:25.381 --> 19:28.036
Don't know.
Haven't asked.

19:28.036 --> 19:29.907
Okay, look,

19:29.907 --> 19:32.780
I'm gonna text you
a back-of-napkin offer.

19:32.780 --> 19:35.043
It's healthy.
Think about it.

19:35.043 --> 19:36.958
<i>It's a chance for you
to tell the big stories</i>

19:36.958 --> 19:38.438
<i>the way you want.</i>

19:42.093 --> 19:43.312
Who was that?

19:43.312 --> 19:45.532
Uh, New York friend.

19:45.532 --> 19:47.229
Did you forget
your coffee?

19:47.229 --> 19:50.014
Yep.
Any updates?

19:50.014 --> 19:51.233
Yeah, I got a hit.

19:51.233 --> 19:54.018
VPO in Tuxecan
remembers Ezra.

19:54.018 --> 19:56.282
- Where's Tuxecan?
- Southeast.

19:56.282 --> 19:57.805
He was seeing
a local girl there.

19:57.805 --> 20:00.503
Um, Julie.
Beat her up.

20:00.503 --> 20:02.375
The VPO called the Troopers
and they charged him.

20:02.375 --> 20:03.463
Charged him?

20:03.463 --> 20:05.378
Why don't we see it
on his sheet?

20:05.378 --> 20:06.857
Can we talk to the victim?

20:06.857 --> 20:09.773
VPO said Julie won't talk
to strangers on the phone.

20:09.773 --> 20:11.471
Well, does this VPO
have a name?

20:11.471 --> 20:13.560
Um, Sadie.

20:13.560 --> 20:15.126
We going to Tuxecan?

20:15.126 --> 20:16.650
Feels like it.

20:16.650 --> 20:18.782
Stanley's gonna push back
on the cost.

20:18.782 --> 20:20.958
Any chance you could ask
the poet pilot?

20:20.958 --> 20:23.526
Yeah. I could.

20:23.526 --> 20:25.093
Really?

20:26.486 --> 20:28.357
Yeah. Really.

20:31.055 --> 20:32.405
What's up?

20:32.405 --> 20:35.016
I'm wrestling
with a dilemma.

20:35.016 --> 20:38.106
Oh.
You know I like me a dilemma.

20:41.022 --> 20:42.241
Lay it on me.

20:43.372 --> 20:48.377
I worry sometimes that I, professionally,

20:48.377 --> 20:51.902
am too observant
of common social mores,

20:51.902 --> 20:56.167
too considerate
of other people's feelings.

20:56.167 --> 20:59.040
To the detriment of your work,
you're saying?

20:59.040 --> 21:00.520
Yes.

21:00.520 --> 21:03.218
Would I be a better journalist
if I were more...

21:03.218 --> 21:04.959
morally flexible?

21:04.959 --> 21:06.917
More...

21:06.917 --> 21:09.355
Like Eileen?

21:11.444 --> 21:13.750
She and Roz need something
for the Gloria Nanmac story,

21:13.750 --> 21:15.143
something important.

21:15.143 --> 21:18.494
If I asked Eileen for something,
she would get it.

21:18.494 --> 21:22.846
My friend Gary won't help,
and I could press him...

21:22.846 --> 21:25.545
Mm.

21:25.545 --> 21:27.982
Do you think this is something
Gary could do for you?

21:27.982 --> 21:29.505
Yes. I do.

21:29.505 --> 21:32.856
It would be unpleasant for him,
but it's doable.

21:32.856 --> 21:35.642
So maybe dip your toe
in the pushy waters,

21:35.642 --> 21:38.514
see what it feels like.

21:47.784 --> 21:50.570
Hey, hey, hey!
No complaining.

21:50.570 --> 21:52.267
These-- These are
friends of mine.

21:52.267 --> 21:54.182
We're reporters.
We've heard worse.

21:54.182 --> 21:57.011
Much,
but the tail is new.

21:58.404 --> 22:00.667
It's a nice day, huh?

22:00.667 --> 22:02.582
Yeah. It is.

22:02.582 --> 22:07.935
Do you guys ever hang out
on terra firma, or just up here?

22:07.935 --> 22:09.676
What is wrong with
up here?

22:09.676 --> 22:11.242
What are you,
an altitudist, Roz?

22:11.242 --> 22:14.158
Sounds like it.
She's a Planet Earther.

22:14.158 --> 22:17.336
No judgment.

22:17.336 --> 22:19.729
Just trying to get a vector
on things.

22:19.729 --> 22:22.036
"Vector." Very nice.

22:22.036 --> 22:23.124
Very nice.

22:23.124 --> 22:25.648
Felt pretty good about it, myself.

22:25.648 --> 22:28.085
How hard is it
to learn how to fly?

22:28.085 --> 22:30.000
It's surprisingly
not that hard.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.611
I mean,
if you have the--

22:31.611 --> 22:32.916
you know, you have
the right teacher.

22:34.657 --> 22:37.660
Are you, uh--
Are you a little fly-curious?

22:37.660 --> 22:39.619
Maybe.

22:39.619 --> 22:41.925
Do you ever
just fly to fly?

22:41.925 --> 22:43.318
All the time.

22:43.318 --> 22:49.150
If I'm ever stuck
with my writing or my life,

22:49.150 --> 22:52.936
I come up here,
let it all go.

22:52.936 --> 22:54.285
<i>Kawdigoo.</i>

22:54.285 --> 22:55.635
What's that mean?

22:55.635 --> 22:57.724
"The water has settled clear."

22:59.160 --> 23:01.380
When life gets tangled,
you follow the river

23:01.380 --> 23:04.034
until the chaos falls away.

23:05.471 --> 23:07.821
<i>Kawdigoo.</i>

23:07.821 --> 23:09.779
I like that.

23:09.779 --> 23:12.216
Does the chaos fall away?

23:12.216 --> 23:14.088
Every single time.

23:14.088 --> 23:16.482
Oh.

23:16.482 --> 23:19.006
Just to say it, if you guys
ever do take your show

23:19.006 --> 23:22.444
to Planet Earth,
I'll totally support it.

23:36.937 --> 23:39.418
You must be the reporters
from <i>The Daily Alaskan.</i>

23:39.418 --> 23:40.767
We are.
Sadie Quinn?

23:40.767 --> 23:43.857
Yeah, it's me.
Welcome to Tuxecan.

23:43.857 --> 23:44.945
You must be Roz.

23:44.945 --> 23:46.947
- Yeah. This is Eileen.
- Hi.

23:46.947 --> 23:48.949
We gotta go, if you don't mind.
I just got a call.

23:48.949 --> 23:50.124
Some guy's shooting up
a house.

23:50.124 --> 23:51.821
Need to make sure
he doesn't hurt someone.

23:58.915 --> 24:01.918
Ah, Jonah.

24:01.918 --> 24:03.877
What the hell's he doing?

24:03.877 --> 24:06.227
Morris!

24:06.227 --> 24:07.489
Oh, Jesus.

24:07.489 --> 24:08.664
Does someone live here?

24:08.664 --> 24:10.187
No one.

24:10.187 --> 24:12.581
The former owner, Morris,
he died a year ago.

24:12.581 --> 24:15.323
It's been empty since. You two
mind staying in the truck?

24:15.323 --> 24:17.151
Not at all.

24:17.151 --> 24:18.805
Do you have a gun?

24:18.805 --> 24:20.981
Town can't afford to insure me
for one when I'm on the clock.

24:20.981 --> 24:22.286
Morris!

24:22.286 --> 24:23.984
Ain't that a twist?

24:26.334 --> 24:28.815
Morris!

24:33.733 --> 24:36.387
Morris!

24:36.387 --> 24:38.999
Come on.
Let's go back to town.

24:40.653 --> 24:42.045
What is she doing?

24:42.045 --> 24:43.960
Hugging an angry man
with a gun.

24:45.875 --> 24:47.747
As one does.

24:58.540 --> 24:59.672
All good?

24:59.672 --> 25:01.021
Mostly.

25:01.021 --> 25:02.718
Jonah's off his meds.

25:02.718 --> 25:05.721
He and Morris were friends and
he's angry at Morris for dying.

25:05.721 --> 25:07.157
That's really heartbreaking.

25:07.157 --> 25:09.551
Sounds like a job for
a professional psychologist.

25:09.551 --> 25:11.901
Well, he had to settle
for this amateur one.

25:11.901 --> 25:13.555
Jack-of-all-trades.

25:13.555 --> 25:15.209
I do my best.

25:17.254 --> 25:19.039
What are the cots for?

25:19.039 --> 25:21.389
Anyone who needs
a safe place to sleep.

25:21.389 --> 25:23.957
Do, uh, people just call you
when they need help?

25:23.957 --> 25:25.524
Who else
are they gonna call?

25:25.524 --> 25:26.916
911?

25:28.178 --> 25:30.441
If you call 911 out here,

25:30.441 --> 25:32.487
you get transferred
to a 1-800 number

25:32.487 --> 25:35.621
which then connects you to
a call center way up in Wasilla.

25:35.621 --> 25:38.232
Wasilla?
That's, um...

25:38.232 --> 25:40.364
That's like calling Miami
to get the police

25:40.364 --> 25:42.279
to come out in Chicago.

25:42.279 --> 25:44.368
That's Alaska.

25:44.368 --> 25:47.154
Gary?

25:47.154 --> 25:48.329
Bob?

25:48.329 --> 25:49.765
What are you doing here?

25:49.765 --> 25:51.724
I need to talk to you, Gary.

25:51.724 --> 25:54.335
Is this about
the phone records?

25:54.335 --> 25:57.381
C'mon, Bob.
I told you my hands are tied.

25:57.381 --> 25:58.687
You got time for a beer?

25:58.687 --> 26:00.297
I have a new malted
barley brown roast

26:00.297 --> 26:02.430
that's very toasty
and rich.

26:02.430 --> 26:05.999
That's kind of you, Gary,
but this visit's all business.

26:05.999 --> 26:08.479
At my home?

26:08.479 --> 26:09.916
You didn't call me back.

26:12.179 --> 26:14.137
I can't give you
those phone records.

26:14.137 --> 26:16.096
A leak like that
could get me fired.

26:16.096 --> 26:18.838
I wouldn't be asking
if it wasn't important, Gary.

26:20.230 --> 26:21.580
You wouldn't be breaking
anyone's confidence.

26:21.580 --> 26:23.190
The owner of the phone
passed away.

26:23.190 --> 26:25.322
A murder victim, actually.

26:25.322 --> 26:28.543
It could help bring
her killer to justice.

26:28.543 --> 26:30.284
You should do this, Gary.

26:30.284 --> 26:31.807
I'm done with this, Bob.

26:31.807 --> 26:33.417
Please leave.

26:33.417 --> 26:34.680
Now.

26:37.987 --> 26:40.860
You know,
we did a reader survey recently

26:40.860 --> 26:42.426
tracking
customer satisfaction

26:42.426 --> 26:44.994
of Alaskan
cellphone providers.

26:44.994 --> 26:47.083
Guess who came in
dead last?

26:47.083 --> 26:48.781
Teletrove.

26:51.610 --> 26:53.568
I'm just
following the rules.

26:53.568 --> 26:55.831
I'll pass that along
to Gloria Nanmac's mother,

26:55.831 --> 26:57.485
who's desperately hoping
to find out

26:57.485 --> 27:00.531
who killed her daughter
before she succumbs to cancer.

27:02.098 --> 27:04.361
You can't put that on me.

27:04.361 --> 27:06.015
We're prepared to
publish an article

27:06.015 --> 27:10.280
detailing Teletrove's failure to
respond to consumer complaints.

27:10.280 --> 27:12.587
But I'd much rather
write an article

27:12.587 --> 27:15.982
about how some unnamed
Teletrove Cellular executive

27:15.982 --> 27:19.855
did the right thing
and helped solve a murder.

27:20.769 --> 27:22.641
You're kinda
being a dick, Bob.

27:22.641 --> 27:23.729
I know.

27:25.165 --> 27:29.343
But if I'm being honest,
I don't see any other way.

27:29.343 --> 27:33.521
I met Ezra at Crystal's,
a bar in town.

27:33.521 --> 27:34.914
The whole village
was excited

27:34.914 --> 27:38.265
about finally getting
high-speed Internet.

27:38.265 --> 27:42.530
People were always buying
the Denali guys cocktails.

27:42.530 --> 27:43.618
He was fun...

27:43.618 --> 27:45.664
at first.

27:45.664 --> 27:47.187
What changed?

27:47.187 --> 27:50.712
Sometimes when he drank,
he turned mean.

27:50.712 --> 27:52.061
Didn't really bother me
at first.

27:52.061 --> 27:56.065
I was kinda wild
back then myself.

27:56.065 --> 27:58.067
When did he hurt you?

27:58.067 --> 28:02.506
One night,
he just... snapped.

28:04.204 --> 28:05.945
Beat me up pretty bad.

28:08.338 --> 28:12.647
I played dead to survive,
and then when he passed out,

28:12.647 --> 28:14.562
I crawled over here.

28:14.562 --> 28:17.652
When I got over there,
Mr. Fisher was still passed out,

28:17.652 --> 28:19.436
so I restrained him.

28:26.139 --> 28:27.749
Troopers came
the next morning.

28:27.749 --> 28:31.405
They arrested him and took him
to the courthouse in Sunrise.

28:32.623 --> 28:34.625
Did the DA ever call you?

28:36.018 --> 28:37.324
Never heard from them.

28:39.500 --> 28:43.199
Next thing I knew, the charges
were dropped and he was gone.

28:44.374 --> 28:46.463
Do you have any other
pictures or notes

28:46.463 --> 28:48.988
or evidence
in that drawer?

28:48.988 --> 28:51.555
I keep notes on everything
that happens.

28:55.864 --> 28:57.257
We need to figure out
what happened

28:57.257 --> 28:59.825
at the courthouse
in Sunrise.

28:59.825 --> 29:01.000
How far away is it?

29:01.000 --> 29:03.002
60 miles or so.

29:03.002 --> 29:04.612
I'm happy to drive you.

29:10.226 --> 29:15.710
We keep all our local records
on... there.

29:16.972 --> 29:19.366
Go ahead.
Just type in a name.

29:27.983 --> 29:30.725
That was quick.
There it is.

29:30.725 --> 29:33.597
Felony assault
and domestic violence.

29:33.597 --> 29:35.817
April 2018.
Ezra Fisher.

29:35.817 --> 29:37.601
It's just like Sadie
and Julie described it,

29:37.601 --> 29:39.342
so why haven't
we seen this before?

29:39.342 --> 29:40.648
Excuse me?

29:40.648 --> 29:42.519
Why isn't this charge
on CourtView?

29:42.519 --> 29:44.652
Let me see.

29:46.959 --> 29:48.699
Oh, that's because the DA
dropped the charge

29:48.699 --> 29:50.353
a month and a half later.

29:50.353 --> 29:52.791
So? It should still be available
on CourtView.

29:52.791 --> 29:55.141
Not true.
A few years back, the--

29:55.141 --> 29:56.795
they passed a law
that prohibits us

29:56.795 --> 29:59.841
from publishing domestic
violence or other charges

29:59.841 --> 30:01.451
that were dropped
or dismissed.

30:01.451 --> 30:03.845
Including sexual assault?

30:03.845 --> 30:06.152
Yeah.

30:06.152 --> 30:09.503
I guess the thinking behind it
is, one false accusation

30:09.503 --> 30:11.461
can ruin a guy's life,
you know?

30:11.461 --> 30:14.595
Ezra could've been stopped if
this information was available.

30:14.595 --> 30:16.379
So the only clue that Ezra
has a history

30:16.379 --> 30:20.209
of violently attacking women
is hidden on this one computer.

30:20.209 --> 30:21.907
The question is how many
other charges

30:21.907 --> 30:25.345
against violent abusers are
hidden in dusty courthouses?

30:29.349 --> 30:32.482
Why does it smell
vaguely exotic in here?

30:32.482 --> 30:33.832
Did you bring
that ferret back?

30:33.832 --> 30:36.356
No. They've been here
since yesterday.

30:36.356 --> 30:38.010
Well,
I admire the dedication.

30:38.010 --> 30:40.621
Yeah, very curious
to see what it's gonna yield.

30:40.621 --> 30:43.363
- How'd it go in Tuxecan?
- Good.

30:43.363 --> 30:45.887
And bad, depending
on your point of view.

30:45.887 --> 30:47.193
Listen to this.

30:47.193 --> 30:49.543
So, I made some calls to
some of the other courts

30:49.543 --> 30:51.414
after Roz told me
what happened in Sunrise,

30:51.414 --> 30:52.720
and they all said
they couldn't give me

30:52.720 --> 30:54.069
the information
over the phone.

30:54.069 --> 30:55.505
- Why not?
- It's policy.

30:55.505 --> 30:57.464
You have to ask for
the records in person.

30:57.464 --> 30:59.422
Obviously, we can't fly
to every village and do that.

30:59.422 --> 31:00.946
So what's the workaround?

31:00.946 --> 31:02.948
Well, I called the
people from each of the villages

31:02.948 --> 31:05.689
who sent in tips
about missing relatives.

31:05.689 --> 31:08.388
They were more than happy
to make the requests for me.

31:08.388 --> 31:09.911
And?

31:09.911 --> 31:13.697
And I got two more DV charges
against your boy, Ezra.

31:13.697 --> 31:16.004
One dropped, one dismissed.

31:16.004 --> 31:17.919
So neither charges
were ever made public.

31:17.919 --> 31:20.356
So it's a pattern
of violent behavior

31:20.356 --> 31:22.837
that's been virtually erased
from the system.

31:22.837 --> 31:24.883
Listen,
I gotta deal with this.

31:24.883 --> 31:26.101
- Thanks, Austin.
- Yeah!

31:27.755 --> 31:29.539
Maybe I should take another shot
at Taylor before we go to print.

31:29.539 --> 31:32.107
Yeah. Good. The new information
on Ezra might be enough

31:32.107 --> 31:35.502
to make her reconsider
and let us talk to her kid.

31:38.026 --> 31:41.334
Hey. Um...

31:41.334 --> 31:43.858
Look, I'm--

31:43.858 --> 31:47.166
I'm so sorry about
how contentious

31:47.166 --> 31:49.342
our last
mediation session was.

31:49.342 --> 31:52.736
I know you care about Zach's
safety as much as I do.

31:52.736 --> 31:54.260
Yeah.

31:54.260 --> 31:57.045
You know, there are crazy people
with guns in Chicago, too.

31:57.045 --> 31:58.394
Yeah. I know.
You're right.

31:58.394 --> 32:01.484
But there's also newspapers
there as well.

32:01.484 --> 32:06.402
And magazines
and even TV stations.

32:06.402 --> 32:10.450
- Anna...
- Zach needs his father,

32:10.450 --> 32:13.061
but his father doesn't
need to be in Alaska.

32:13.061 --> 32:14.889
Not forever.

32:14.889 --> 32:17.152
Right?

32:17.152 --> 32:21.504
Just come, okay?

32:21.504 --> 32:24.029
Get your own place.

32:24.029 --> 32:28.424
Be a journalist,
be a father.

32:28.424 --> 32:31.645
You can do those things
in Chicago,

32:31.645 --> 32:34.300
and we can give Zach
the life he deserves.

32:36.606 --> 32:38.217
Think about it?

32:40.393 --> 32:43.178
I don't have to.

32:43.178 --> 32:46.007
Zach has a good life here,
a unique life,

32:46.007 --> 32:47.574
and he loves it.

32:47.574 --> 32:50.838
And I have a life here
that I love.

32:50.838 --> 32:53.972
You're the only one
who's dissatisfied with Alaska,

32:53.972 --> 33:00.500
but I am not going to
willingly uproot myself or Zach.

33:03.851 --> 33:08.638
Okay. Well, then, I guess I will
see you in court.

33:14.253 --> 33:16.037
Taylor, please,
just hear me out.

33:16.037 --> 33:18.213
I'm sick of you.
Just leave me alone.

33:18.213 --> 33:19.998
He's hurt other women!

33:19.998 --> 33:21.695
Three that I know of so far.

33:21.695 --> 33:24.524
Four if you include Gloria.

33:24.524 --> 33:26.047
How come I don't know
about this?

33:26.047 --> 33:28.049
Because Alaska's more worried
about protecting

33:28.049 --> 33:32.097
the reputation of abusers than
the safety of their victims.

33:39.974 --> 33:44.935
This is Julie from Tuxecan
after Ezra was through with her.

33:47.025 --> 33:48.287
Tuxecan?

33:48.287 --> 33:51.203
He worked there
for a few months.

33:51.203 --> 33:53.118
Yeah, I remember.

33:53.118 --> 33:56.425
This is hard.
I get it.

33:56.425 --> 33:58.645
But it's real,

33:58.645 --> 34:01.735
and we need to figure
this out together.

34:01.735 --> 34:04.390
I need to
talk to Jackson.

34:04.390 --> 34:05.608
Please.

34:07.436 --> 34:09.656
Hi, Jackson.
I'm Roz.

34:09.656 --> 34:11.788
Hi.

34:11.788 --> 34:14.661
I want to talk to you
about something very important.

34:14.661 --> 34:18.143
But first, I want you to know
you're not in any trouble, okay?

34:18.143 --> 34:20.710
- Are you the police?
- No.

34:20.710 --> 34:25.063
I'm a reporter
for <i>The Daily Alaskan.</i>

34:25.063 --> 34:26.673
Kinda like the guy
on your shirt.

34:26.673 --> 34:30.242
He works for
the <i>Daily Bugle,</i> right?

34:30.242 --> 34:33.375
Yeah, but he's a photographer,
not a reporter.

34:34.811 --> 34:36.465
Good point.

34:36.465 --> 34:39.425
Do you remember visiting your
dad up in Meade two years ago?

34:41.644 --> 34:44.256
Did he take you
to a grown-up party?

34:46.388 --> 34:49.609
You can tell us the truth.
I won't be mad.

34:52.699 --> 34:55.571
Did he ask you
to not tell anyone?

34:55.571 --> 34:57.138
Yeah.

35:00.141 --> 35:04.058
Jackson, do you
remember this woman?

35:04.058 --> 35:06.147
She used crutches.

35:07.627 --> 35:09.455
Do you remember her, honey?

35:15.330 --> 35:17.071
Do you know what happened
to her that night?

35:17.071 --> 35:19.987
I think she got hurt.

35:19.987 --> 35:22.381
Daddy had to
drive her home.

35:22.381 --> 35:24.731
She was sleeping.

35:24.731 --> 35:27.212
Were you with them
when he drove her home?

35:28.909 --> 35:29.910
No.

35:29.910 --> 35:33.957
He-- He left me
at the party.

35:33.957 --> 35:36.177
Are you sure?

35:36.177 --> 35:38.136
Is that true?

35:38.136 --> 35:41.095
He told me
not to tell anyone.

35:41.095 --> 35:43.184
He said I'd get in trouble.

35:45.578 --> 35:49.059
You're not in trouble, Jacks.

35:49.059 --> 35:50.539
You're not.

35:59.505 --> 36:01.724
DA David.
Got a minute?

36:01.724 --> 36:03.335
Ms. Friendly.

36:03.335 --> 36:05.902
If this is about Toby Crenshaw,
I have no comment.

36:05.902 --> 36:07.904
It's not about Toby.
It's about Ezra Fisher.

36:07.904 --> 36:10.124
He was a person of interest
in the Gloria Nanmac case.

36:10.124 --> 36:11.995
Yeah, I know.
He had a solid alibi.

36:11.995 --> 36:13.562
Ezra was arrested
three times

36:13.562 --> 36:16.086
for felony domestic assault
around the state.

36:16.086 --> 36:18.741
Because of Rule 40, those
arrests were never made public.

36:18.741 --> 36:20.961
We pulled the records
from the villages.

36:20.961 --> 36:23.093
Like I said, Mr. Fisher
had an alibi

36:23.093 --> 36:24.921
for the night Gloria Nanmac
went missing.

36:24.921 --> 36:26.967
That alibi fell apart.

36:26.967 --> 36:28.447
We just talked to
his 10-year-old son,

36:28.447 --> 36:31.319
and he told us that Ezra
left Clarence Redding's

36:31.319 --> 36:32.712
the night
Gloria went missing.

36:32.712 --> 36:34.844
He said
she was sleeping.

36:36.672 --> 36:39.197
Even if it's true--
and testimony from children

36:39.197 --> 36:41.808
is historically
unreliable--

36:41.808 --> 36:44.898
all it proves is that Ezra
left a location with Gloria.

36:44.898 --> 36:46.247
You're not gonna do
anything about it?

36:46.247 --> 36:48.597
I have a signed confession
from Toby Crenshaw.

36:48.597 --> 36:50.773
That's a hell of a lot more
convincing than three arrests

36:50.773 --> 36:53.863
that resulted in not
one prosecution of Ezra Fisher.

36:53.863 --> 36:55.169
What if we
write an article

36:55.169 --> 36:57.650
about how Rule 40
protects domestic abusers?

36:57.650 --> 36:59.260
That's wildly inaccurate.

36:59.260 --> 37:02.872
Is it? Under Rule 40, if charges
against an alleged abuser

37:02.872 --> 37:04.134
get dropped or dismissed,

37:04.134 --> 37:06.398
the courts don't have
to log those arrests

37:06.398 --> 37:07.964
into the statewide database.

37:07.964 --> 37:10.663
Men accused of violent crimes
are hiding in plain sight.

37:10.663 --> 37:12.012
Like Ezra.

37:12.012 --> 37:13.448
So a prosecutor in Anchorage
would have no idea

37:13.448 --> 37:16.843
if a suspect in Scammon Bay
or Russian Mission

37:16.843 --> 37:18.540
had been charged
with assault.

37:19.672 --> 37:22.762
Innocent
until proven guilty.

37:22.762 --> 37:25.504
It would be highly prejudicial
to leave an arrest

37:25.504 --> 37:27.897
on someone's record
if charges are dropped.

37:27.897 --> 37:30.683
It's also highly prejudicial
to charge the wrong man

37:30.683 --> 37:32.293
with Gloria Nanmac's murder.

37:32.293 --> 37:34.817
Toby's taking a plea
in less than a week.

37:34.817 --> 37:37.472
Off the record,
the Governor is satisfied

37:37.472 --> 37:40.562
that justice is being served,
and so am I.

37:42.042 --> 37:43.783
This train
has left the station.

37:43.783 --> 37:45.306
Goodbye.

37:47.265 --> 37:49.310
- Fill me in.
- The good news is,

37:49.310 --> 37:50.790
we're pretty sure we know
who killed Gloria.

37:50.790 --> 37:52.966
The bad news is, it's not
the guy going to prison.

37:52.966 --> 37:54.881
And we can't do
a damn thing about it.

37:54.881 --> 37:56.926
Ezra was right.
We're not the cops.

37:56.926 --> 37:58.101
We can't touch him.

37:58.101 --> 37:59.799
Our stories aren't
moving the needle.

37:59.799 --> 38:03.237
Toby's rotting in jail,
and the DA won't listen to us.

38:03.237 --> 38:04.630
He may not be listening,

38:04.630 --> 38:06.196
but the rest of the state is.

38:06.196 --> 38:08.024
Whether you realize it
or not,

38:08.024 --> 38:10.070
you're having a dialogue
with Alaskans.

38:10.070 --> 38:12.333
The truth is a slow bullet.

38:12.333 --> 38:14.074
Don't stop.

38:14.074 --> 38:16.294
Go. Write your story.

38:16.294 --> 38:18.208
This reads well.

38:18.208 --> 38:19.862
Yeah, it's good.

38:19.862 --> 38:23.649
Uh, few small things.

38:23.649 --> 38:24.954
Check it.

38:26.652 --> 38:28.001
You okay?

38:28.001 --> 38:30.960
I hate it when I lose faith
in what we're doing.

38:30.960 --> 38:34.747
Well, Alaska's a good place
to lose it, for what it's worth.

38:34.747 --> 38:36.531
Does that mean you're
gonna take the job

38:36.531 --> 38:37.880
at <i>The New York Times?</i>

38:37.880 --> 38:41.362
If I'm being honest,
I haven't decided.

38:41.362 --> 38:43.756
Well, if I'm being honest,
I'd want redemption, too.

38:43.756 --> 38:45.801
After what
you went through,

38:45.801 --> 38:48.717
walking into <i>The New York Times,</i>
everyone watching...

38:48.717 --> 38:52.068
I do like the idea of punching
cancel culture in the face.

38:52.068 --> 38:53.505
So I came clean.

38:53.505 --> 38:54.941
Your turn.

38:54.941 --> 38:56.725
You taking the WaPo offer?

38:57.900 --> 38:59.293
How'd you know?

38:59.293 --> 39:01.034
They called me
as a reference.

39:01.034 --> 39:05.734
Well, at least someone's
paying attention to our stories.

39:05.734 --> 39:09.085
So? You going?

39:09.085 --> 39:11.174
I haven't decided either.

39:11.174 --> 39:13.002
Getting an offer
from <i>The Washington Post</i>

39:13.002 --> 39:14.569
ain't no small feat.

39:14.569 --> 39:17.137
It's impressive.

39:17.137 --> 39:19.226
And deserved.

39:19.226 --> 39:21.402
I suppose so.

39:21.402 --> 39:26.451
I always thought I'd jump at it,
but now... I don't know.

39:26.451 --> 39:28.409
How you gonna decide?

39:28.409 --> 39:30.933
Guess I'm waiting
for a sign?

39:30.933 --> 39:32.195
Let me know when you see it.

39:32.195 --> 39:33.632
Sorry to barge in,

39:33.632 --> 39:36.025
but we have something
we want to show you.

39:38.419 --> 39:40.160
Hi, everyone.

39:40.160 --> 39:43.119
Well, first, I want to
thank Jindaháa

39:43.119 --> 39:45.644
and his talented
and generous friends

39:45.644 --> 39:47.341
for putting in the time
to help with this project.

39:47.341 --> 39:50.431
And of course,
we wouldn't be standing here

39:50.431 --> 39:54.435
if it weren't for Eileen
and Roz's MMIW series.

39:54.435 --> 39:57.656
So, here goes.

39:59.309 --> 40:03.444
For context, I have to point out
that Alaska Native women

40:03.444 --> 40:06.099
experience the highest rate
of sexual assault

40:06.099 --> 40:09.537
of any demographic
in the United States.

40:10.843 --> 40:13.759
This is the first case
we entered.

40:13.759 --> 40:15.369
We all know her by now.

40:15.369 --> 40:16.501
Gloria.

40:18.111 --> 40:21.114
These women went missing
in the last year.

40:23.595 --> 40:25.466
This is the past five years.

40:30.166 --> 40:31.864
10 years.

40:36.172 --> 40:38.044
15 years.

40:40.568 --> 40:43.876
In the past 100 years,

40:43.876 --> 40:49.229
literally thousands of
Native women have disappeared.

40:49.229 --> 40:53.233
Still today, in 2023,

40:53.233 --> 40:57.977
at least one woman goes missing
weekly from Anchorage alone.

41:01.937 --> 41:04.462
Extraordinary work.

41:14.733 --> 41:16.256
Special delivery.

41:18.040 --> 41:19.781
Is this
what I think it is?

41:19.781 --> 41:22.480
The records for
Gloria's burner phone.

41:22.480 --> 41:23.742
Thanks, Bob.

41:23.742 --> 41:26.048
How'd you get your pal
to change his mind?

41:26.048 --> 41:28.921
I channeled my inner Fitzgerald.

41:28.921 --> 41:31.314
That sounds painful.

41:31.314 --> 41:33.491
It was, a little.

41:33.491 --> 41:34.622
But it worked.

41:34.622 --> 41:35.710
Thank you.

41:41.760 --> 41:44.719
Look at the date
of the last call she made.

41:44.719 --> 41:48.941
November 30th, to 911.

41:48.941 --> 41:50.638
She disappeared the 28th.

41:50.638 --> 41:53.075
Sylvie reported her missing
the next morning.

41:53.075 --> 41:54.816
If Ezra left Gloria
on the tundra

41:54.816 --> 41:56.122
on the night of the 28th,

41:56.122 --> 41:58.037
she was alive
for at least two more days.

41:58.037 --> 41:59.647
So while the police refused
to search for her,

41:59.647 --> 42:01.301
while they did
absolutely nothing--

42:01.301 --> 42:04.783
Gloria was making desperate
calls, including one to 911.

42:04.783 --> 42:06.480
There has to be a recording.

42:06.480 --> 42:08.395
And we gotta hear it.

42:15.576 --> 42:19.580

42:19.580 --> 42:23.584
