00:50.100 --> 00:51.100
Hi, Alex.

00:51.179 --> 00:55.060
I'm just calling to let you know
I'm not feeling too well.

00:55.139 --> 00:56.620
I have to stay in bed.

00:56.700 --> 01:00.340
- You're kidding me?
- I know the timing is horrible.

01:00.420 --> 01:03.380
<i>- I just can't do it.</i>
<i>- Don't play the PMS card today.</i>

01:03.459 --> 01:06.179
I'm really sorry.

02:23.419 --> 02:25.859
Enginnsdottir to MPS.

02:25.940 --> 02:30.100
<i>Does Mr. Black's sound give</i>
<i>any clue on what's going on? Over.</i>

02:30.739 --> 02:34.340
<i>MPS to Enginnsdottir. Parts of the</i>
<i>communication were in Norwegian.</i>

02:34.419 --> 02:38.220
<i>We're trying to decipher it now.</i>
<i>Over</i>

02:38.299 --> 02:43.460
<i>Enginnsdottir to all vehicles.</i>
<i>Black just left his position, over.</i>

02:43.539 --> 02:48.500
<i>This is Haaland asking permission</i>
<i>to follow Mr. Black on foot, over.</i>

02:48.579 --> 02:52.259
<i>Operational leader OPK</i>
<i>to operational leader MPS.</i>

02:52.340 --> 02:56.299
<i>Instructions were</i>
<i>to keep position or abort, over.</i>

02:59.220 --> 03:03.220
This is a shitstorm if I ever saw one.
Is the time agent in position?

03:03.699 --> 03:06.500
Affirmative.

03:10.579 --> 03:13.019
Alfhildr!

03:20.539 --> 03:23.220
Hello?
Are you still there?

03:48.699 --> 03:51.620
Activate red procedure immediately.

04:03.259 --> 04:06.739
BEFOREIGNERS

05:12.059 --> 05:14.260
What's happening?

06:09.619 --> 06:12.260
God is good

07:10.499 --> 07:13.220
Good morning, Wenche.

07:19.979 --> 07:24.979
<i>Now the sun is rising from</i>
<i>the eastern brim.</i>

07:25.539 --> 07:32.179
<i>Gilding the top of the cliff</i>
<i>and the mountain rim.</i>

07:32.859 --> 07:39.499
<i>Be glad, my soul,</i>
<i>and let you voice ring.</i>

07:40.140 --> 07:44.220
Rise from Earth's abode.

07:44.299 --> 07:51.220
<i>And with your thanks and faith,</i>
<i>to Heaven you swing.</i>

07:53.059 --> 07:55.580
- Thank you.
- May I help you?

07:56.100 --> 07:59.660
Yes...
I work here, right?

07:59.739 --> 08:03.260
How should I know?
I've never seen you before.

08:03.580 --> 08:08.220
- No?
- You must have an access pass.

08:11.660 --> 08:16.020
I did, but...
Harald?

08:17.059 --> 08:22.419
Right. Cleaning personnel are
supposed to meet one floor down.

08:31.100 --> 08:35.060
Dear sinners. King Olaf, in his mercy,
has presented us apostates

08:35.139 --> 08:39.220
with this unique and undeserved
opportunity to atone for our sins

08:39.300 --> 08:41.580
by doing the
cleaning for the true believers.

08:41.659 --> 08:44.859
Thank you, God and King,
for giving us this second chance.

08:44.940 --> 08:49.139
Enginnsdottir? You'll find uniform
and bucket in the cupboard there.

08:49.220 --> 08:54.859
The janitor will show you what to do.
Could you fetch the trash over there?

09:01.460 --> 09:03.540
Hi.

09:05.739 --> 09:08.899
Enginnsdottir?

09:10.060 --> 09:12.420
Not now.

09:21.700 --> 09:25.100
So far, this
is all the information we have.

09:25.180 --> 09:28.139
You can start by emptying those,
okay?

09:28.220 --> 09:33.580
The forensic report is expected later,
but we have received pictures.

09:33.659 --> 09:37.580
As you see, the victim is decorated
with an illegal contraceptive.

09:37.659 --> 09:39.659
A condom.

09:39.739 --> 09:42.300
Maybe the perpetrator
wanted to show displeasure

09:42.379 --> 09:46.300
towards the King's policies
on family planning?

09:58.859 --> 10:02.220
Will you tell me what's going on?

10:16.540 --> 10:20.019
The crosses have ears.
Meet me outside in 1 hour

10:32.019 --> 10:34.100
What's the status?

10:34.180 --> 10:37.220
Two minutes and 45 seconds
since submersion.

10:37.300 --> 10:41.739
Time transpired in alternate reality
9 hours and 4 minutes.

10:42.619 --> 10:46.540
We're approaching
hazardous levels for the veins.

11:24.899 --> 11:27.420
Aren't you going to church,
young lady?

11:27.499 --> 11:31.259
- I'm waiting for a guy.
- I thought so.

11:31.340 --> 11:34.100
I can offer anything
young lovers need.

11:34.180 --> 11:38.340
Birth control pills, morning-after pills,
Rubbers of all kinds.

11:38.420 --> 11:40.220
Thanks, I'm good.

11:41.700 --> 11:44.499
- It'll end in a delicate condition.
- It's not that kind of meeting.

11:44.580 --> 11:46.979
Just leave me alone, okay?

12:06.259 --> 12:09.220
Sorry, I'm late.
Listen.

12:12.300 --> 12:15.940
The encounter between you
and John Roberts created a time rift.

12:16.019 --> 12:20.859
This alternate present we see here,
materialised in its wake.

12:21.739 --> 12:26.460
Why are you normal?
Everyone else is completely spaced out.

12:26.540 --> 12:31.460
Our technology gives me access
to my replica's mind in this reality.

12:31.540 --> 12:33.060
Who are "we"?

12:43.540 --> 12:47.700
The point is that the fundamental
present is under threat...

12:47.779 --> 12:51.779
- You just have to find...
- Find what?

12:52.979 --> 12:56.379
You have to...

12:57.619 --> 13:00.820
Hey! Alex, we have to do what?
Do what?

13:00.899 --> 13:04.300
Just find him...
Find him and make time whole.

13:04.379 --> 13:06.979
Alex!

13:07.060 --> 13:09.899
Hey!
We need help here!

13:23.340 --> 13:28.139
What's the agent's status?
Did he make contact on the other side?

13:28.220 --> 13:31.940
- There's no way to tell.
- We had to take him out.

13:32.019 --> 13:35.259
I guess we better start praying then.

14:35.899 --> 14:42.379
You are white as the snow, maiden.
Why have you not applied spraytan?

14:42.460 --> 14:45.499
I tend to get eczema.

14:45.580 --> 14:48.899
Spray her down
and get rid of the glasses.

14:48.979 --> 14:51.859
She won't see the
conductor without her glasses.

14:51.940 --> 14:55.540
Either the glasses go or she goes.

14:56.820 --> 14:58.220
Come here...

15:02.540 --> 15:09.460
Never doubt! Always fight!

15:12.220 --> 15:16.580
Never doubt! Always fight!
Never doubt!

15:16.899 --> 15:20.220
Never doubt! Al...

15:21.540 --> 15:24.220
What do you want, stranger?

15:24.300 --> 15:27.940
The toast just now,
where did you hear that?

15:28.019 --> 15:31.340
Wouldn't you like to know?

15:31.420 --> 15:37.019
I used to sail with Tore Hund
in the ol' time. I know that is his toast.

15:39.499 --> 15:42.820
One of us.

15:55.139 --> 15:59.060
Do you know where
I can find Tore these days?

16:00.580 --> 16:02.779
Haven't you heard?

16:02.859 --> 16:08.340
Tore Hund was beheaded after
the demonstration at Stiklestad.

16:12.739 --> 16:16.420
This fucking world
is too much to bear.

16:16.499 --> 16:20.619
Our new friend needs more mead.
Will you get a refill from the bucket guy?

16:20.700 --> 16:24.580
No fucking way
am I buying another round.

16:24.659 --> 16:29.340
- Here's the money, you skinflint.
- Let me see that.

16:31.940 --> 16:35.300
What in Hel is that bitch
doing on the money?

16:35.379 --> 16:40.139
Keep it down, lunatic.
That's the Queen.

16:43.700 --> 16:45.739
The queen?

17:11.939 --> 17:14.659
The door is open.

17:26.020 --> 17:29.980
What the hell?
I requested pads.

17:30.659 --> 17:33.820
Isn't that more or
less the same thing?

17:34.540 --> 17:38.020
We are more than happy
to go back and exchange it...

17:38.100 --> 17:39.939
Never mind.

17:43.020 --> 17:45.300
What's the plan, really?

17:45.379 --> 17:49.219
To stroll up and
demand an audience with the Queen?

17:49.300 --> 17:52.219
Something in that ballpark.

18:07.419 --> 18:11.379
- Call it a day?
- We don't want to miss this.

18:26.980 --> 18:29.899
Hey, Queen!

18:30.780 --> 18:33.780
Hey!
Queen!

18:37.780 --> 18:42.100
- Queen!
- What is that commotion?

18:42.659 --> 18:45.500
Have you gone deaf, witch-woman?

18:45.580 --> 18:50.139
Get your prissy queen's ass down here!

18:50.219 --> 18:53.619
- We have to get out of here.
- Hey!

18:54.260 --> 18:59.340
- What the fuck are you doing?
- I have to talk to the Queen.

20:09.980 --> 20:14.980
It says here that you are a simple
cleaning lady. Is that correct?

20:17.340 --> 20:20.580
I am no more a cleaning lady
than you are a queen.

20:22.219 --> 20:25.859
I had a feeling
you were from the other place.

20:26.939 --> 20:29.980
What are you doing in my realm?

20:30.659 --> 20:34.859
Is that what this is?
Your realm?

20:36.100 --> 20:37.340
No.

20:38.659 --> 20:44.219
You and the time-demon
opened the door to the many worlds.

20:45.060 --> 20:51.580
I'm just a humble sorceress
who seizes my opportunities.

20:52.340 --> 20:57.020
Then you should seize the opportunity
to say farewell to this place.

20:57.100 --> 21:00.659
That door
you mentioned will be shut.

21:00.740 --> 21:04.899
Easy now, trouble-maker.

21:06.459 --> 21:11.060
A chained hand is a threat to no one.

21:30.659 --> 21:33.419
What do you want, Queen?
I'm going on any second.

21:33.500 --> 21:37.379
- This is important. I met her.
- Who?

21:37.459 --> 21:43.139
- She who made the rift in time.
- How do you know it's her?

21:43.219 --> 21:47.020
- I just know.
- Okay... Where is she?

21:47.100 --> 21:52.139
- In the royal guard's jail.
- The situation is under control then.

21:52.659 --> 21:57.859
You don't understand.
She has come from the other side.

21:57.939 --> 22:02.300
Where our lives end in dust.

22:02.379 --> 22:05.419
I have to admit I'm still
having difficulties understanding

22:05.500 --> 22:07.699
this part of your vision.

22:08.219 --> 22:13.659
Understand this:
The woman must die.

22:13.740 --> 22:16.939
- We're going live in two minutes!
- Yes!

22:17.419 --> 22:19.859
I'll see what I can do.

22:43.419 --> 22:45.459
Hands!

23:00.419 --> 23:04.419
- Why you lock in?
- She was in a quarrel with the Queen.

23:04.500 --> 23:08.980
With real Queen?
How you name, Queen-bother?

23:11.139 --> 23:13.419
How you name?

23:13.500 --> 23:16.419
Alfhildr Enginnsdottir.

23:18.300 --> 23:22.020
- Enginnsdottir?
- Why?

23:26.699 --> 23:30.139
Enginnsdottir.
It's Enginnsdottir.

23:44.699 --> 23:45.740
What is going on?

23:46.260 --> 23:48.500
Shaman in ironcave sighted

23:48.580 --> 23:51.859
that Enginnsdottir would free
us from evil White Christ king.

23:51.939 --> 23:56.340
- Who is this shaman?
- Lars Haaland.

24:01.419 --> 24:03.820
Lars Haaland?

25:12.980 --> 25:18.980
<i>The Ullern congregation's choir will</i>
<i>sing the night in with his majesty.</i>

25:47.580 --> 25:50.859
Shut your mouths!

25:50.939 --> 25:54.500
- She go birthing!
- Shit...

25:55.219 --> 25:57.459
Okay, okay!

25:58.179 --> 26:00.540
How do we do this?

26:28.060 --> 26:31.340
You make chaos again?

26:32.139 --> 26:36.139
No more than usual.
Where have you been?

27:22.060 --> 27:25.580
- You're different.
- Different?

27:26.260 --> 27:28.379
From what?

27:28.980 --> 27:32.219
From how I know you in my world.

27:32.300 --> 27:36.780
- We have never met before, sugarpie.
- Well...

27:37.379 --> 27:41.020
Your friends said
you had a vision about me.

27:41.859 --> 27:44.899
I am Enginnsdottir.

27:45.899 --> 27:48.619
I guess I heard that name somewhere.

27:50.020 --> 27:54.740
Then I spun a campfire tale
around it in the longest of nights.

27:56.980 --> 28:01.020
Listen to me, Lars.
I know you.

28:04.020 --> 28:07.500
The reason your eyes are white,
is Temproxate.

28:09.139 --> 28:12.580
You started using it
because your hands hurt.

28:13.500 --> 28:16.740
Ingrid is your daughter.

28:18.179 --> 28:21.060
And you are gluten intolerant.

28:30.340 --> 28:33.619
This world that you claim to be from...

28:35.260 --> 28:37.540
Is it better than ours?

28:42.500 --> 28:45.699
And what do you think
I can contribute with?

28:46.699 --> 28:49.179
Show me the way home.

29:14.899 --> 29:21.219
I see a girl looking for her mother.

29:26.580 --> 29:29.699
What is the girl saying?

29:38.859 --> 29:45.300
She is saying that it cannot die

29:47.020 --> 29:50.139
that which is not born.

29:50.219 --> 29:54.260
- Meaning?
- You'll learn soon enough.

29:58.740 --> 30:02.419
You were supposed
to help me get home.

30:03.820 --> 30:07.340
The killer is the key.

30:07.939 --> 30:10.139
What killer?

30:10.219 --> 30:14.219
He who wrapped the woman in rubber.

30:39.540 --> 30:42.379
How may I be of assistance,
sweet lady?

30:51.060 --> 30:52.300
Hi...

31:16.379 --> 31:19.580
That must wait until tomorrow.
I need to get home to feed Anton.

31:19.659 --> 31:23.419
- Do you feed your husband?
- I wish. Anton is a cat.

32:54.100 --> 32:57.619
Why is there a thread
hanging out of your fanny?

32:58.300 --> 33:00.659
You'll have to ask Aslakr.

33:01.419 --> 33:03.619
Aslakr?

33:13.899 --> 33:18.300
- Answer it.
- Good morning, your Majesty.

33:19.500 --> 33:23.859
- Did you sleep well?
- Skip the smalltalk.

33:25.219 --> 33:28.060
Did you get a hold of her?

34:01.500 --> 34:05.780
- What took you so long?
- I ran into trouble with the Queen.

34:05.859 --> 34:08.900
Yes, I've heard
she can be quite a handful.

34:08.980 --> 34:15.699
This means that you've finally figured out
that I am the notorious condom murderer.

34:16.259 --> 34:19.179
I didn't actually kill that woman.

34:19.739 --> 34:23.219
I merely ornamented
some poor OD'd soul.

34:24.100 --> 34:25.940
To try and get your attention.

34:28.420 --> 34:30.860
Well.
Now you have it.

34:33.420 --> 34:34.739
What do you want?

34:35.819 --> 34:39.460
How much have you
figured out about this place?

34:40.500 --> 34:46.699
As I understand it, the clash between
you and I opened a rift in time.

34:47.060 --> 34:50.540
The queen used the situation
to change some past events.

34:51.819 --> 34:55.619
Thus creating an alternative present
more to her liking.

34:55.699 --> 35:00.940
And how do you suggest
that we fix this unfortunate situation?

35:01.020 --> 35:04.460
We close the fucking rift
and get our old world back.

35:04.860 --> 35:06.500
Think bigger.

35:08.219 --> 35:12.380
- What do you mean?
- Travel back in time with me.

35:13.540 --> 35:17.219
To when the first fish
crawled onto the land.

35:17.580 --> 35:19.619
Together we can eradicate

35:20.179 --> 35:24.779
the precise moment
that mankind was brought into existence.

35:25.739 --> 35:27.659
My plan is the only way

35:27.739 --> 35:31.860
that we can ever break
the never-ending chain of suffering.

35:33.139 --> 35:36.940
You are one crazy fuck,
that's for sure.

35:41.659 --> 35:42.779
Really?

35:44.100 --> 35:46.779
I'm a fighter, not a thinker.

35:47.500 --> 35:49.900
If you want to fight...

35:50.580 --> 35:53.139
The battle doesn't take place here.

36:17.699 --> 36:19.380
She got away,

36:21.100 --> 36:22.659
didn't she?

36:23.980 --> 36:27.139
Things will work out, my queen.

37:12.940 --> 37:15.420
What is the girl saying?

37:16.179 --> 37:19.020
She is saying

37:19.100 --> 37:21.100
that that which is not born,

37:22.219 --> 37:24.739
cannot die.

37:25.380 --> 37:28.100
Enginnsdottir!

37:57.219 --> 37:59.739
Our world has already lost.

39:16.500 --> 39:18.699
Alfhildr!

39:21.020 --> 39:23.580
No, fuck...
Alfhildr?

39:48.699 --> 39:51.179
How is she?

39:51.259 --> 39:53.940
- She has lost a lot of blood.
- But she will survive?

39:54.500 --> 39:56.500
We've done what we can.

39:56.580 --> 40:00.860
Hopefully she will start to recover
within the next couple of days.

40:00.940 --> 40:05.659
Would you say it's a good sign
if she gets up to get a soda?

40:16.179 --> 40:20.179
- Good to see you're back to normal.
- How are you feeling?

40:20.259 --> 40:22.380
- Better now.
- Right...

40:36.380 --> 40:39.060
So, what's the status on the case?

40:39.699 --> 40:42.500
John Roberts was pronounced dead
in the tunnel.

40:42.580 --> 40:45.779
And the body
has been extradited to England.

40:46.580 --> 40:50.779
They are determined that this
was all the work of a psychotic man.

40:50.860 --> 40:53.659
- Not a word about Project 19?
- No.

40:53.739 --> 40:56.500
No one even batted
an eye down at the station.

40:56.580 --> 40:59.460
Seems they have powerful people
backing them on our end too.

40:59.540 --> 41:02.339
That fits with my experience.

41:03.460 --> 41:06.179
I was sent to an alternative present.

41:07.259 --> 41:10.299
Alex contacted me there.

41:10.380 --> 41:14.580
He's an agent
for some supertemporal agency.

41:21.219 --> 41:24.219
I may have
hallucinated parts of it...

41:25.380 --> 41:27.779
Did you talk to Alex
after this happened?

41:27.860 --> 41:33.860
Nobody has. He had a stroke.
Apparently it's quite serious.

41:37.980 --> 41:41.699
<i>Olaf Haraldsson was critically</i>
<i>injured in a car crash yesterday.</i>

41:41.779 --> 41:46.980
<i>Haraldsson reportedly had cocaine</i>
<i>in his bloodstream at the time.</i>

41:47.060 --> 41:51.540
<i>A woman who was also in the vehicle,</i>
<i>was killed on the spot.</i>

41:51.619 --> 41:56.020
<i>She was the district shaman</i>
<i>at the Grønland Centre of Norse Faith.</i>

41:56.540 --> 41:58.299
Are they friends of yours?

41:59.580 --> 42:01.779
Friends would be a stretch.

42:13.219 --> 42:15.380
Your name...

42:16.739 --> 42:20.299
It means you didn't have
any parents back in the old time?

42:20.380 --> 42:23.179
That you were a foundling?

42:26.060 --> 42:29.460
- What are you getting at?
- It's only the two of us here.

42:30.299 --> 42:31.900
You can trust me.

42:40.540 --> 42:43.739
Tore Hund's father's men
found me floating in the sea

42:43.819 --> 42:45.739
on their way home from a raid.

42:45.819 --> 42:50.980
Tore has memories of me
wearing modern clothing.

42:52.659 --> 42:54.259
Oh my God...

43:28.420 --> 43:34.060
<i>The Oslo underground is now running</i>
<i>again after the shutdown last week.</i>

43:34.139 --> 43:37.500
<i>The powerful, electric discharge</i>
<i>was caused by an arc fault,</i>

43:37.580 --> 43:39.739
that has now been repaired.

43:59.739 --> 44:01.299
Hi, Alfhildr.

44:02.179 --> 44:04.860
It's so good
to see you back on your feet.

44:04.940 --> 44:08.219
- It's good to be back.
- Good.

44:08.299 --> 44:10.779
Just a shame Alex isn't here, too.

44:11.500 --> 44:15.420
- Yes, that's life.
- Do you know what hospital he's in?

44:15.500 --> 44:17.100
I would like to visit him.

44:17.580 --> 44:21.580
As far as I understand,
he is still not fit for visitors.

44:21.659 --> 44:24.739
But I will let
you know if the situation changes.

44:29.619 --> 44:33.580
You didn't say a word to Harald
about that foggy report from the MPS.

44:33.659 --> 44:36.020
- That's not like you.
- Well...

44:36.100 --> 44:38.580
There's a lot going on
in my private life lately.

44:38.659 --> 44:42.860
What?
Did you get a girlfriend?

44:42.940 --> 44:48.259
No, quite the opposite.
I'm going to be a grandfather.

44:48.860 --> 44:53.060
- Don't tell me Ingrid's pregnant...
- With Sturla Arnesson.

44:54.779 --> 44:58.179
I think skitr
is the word you're looking for.

45:00.020 --> 45:01.420
Skitr.

45:15.540 --> 45:17.060
It's open!

45:21.139 --> 45:24.420
- What is that?
- This is a drying cabinet.

45:24.739 --> 45:28.739
Skjalg and the guys
gave it to me for my 50th birthday.

45:28.819 --> 45:31.339
First I put the cabinet on the porch.

45:31.420 --> 45:34.779
But the neighbour went haywire.
Those contemporary noses, you know.

45:35.380 --> 45:39.380
Well, I'm with the neighbour on this.

45:39.980 --> 45:43.900
We'll have to put this on
the account of your unclear origin.

45:51.219 --> 45:52.259
Hi. Are you coming with?

45:52.339 --> 45:55.100
Yes... Mum was a little offended
when she heard you were taking me.

45:55.179 --> 45:58.460
If you don't want us there...

45:58.540 --> 46:01.580
- Of course you should come.
- Okay?

46:02.420 --> 46:06.659
I read a very interesting article
in a psychological periodical

46:06.739 --> 46:11.460
regarding the mother-daughter relation.
And there it said that...

46:11.540 --> 46:15.219
- Not now. Let's just go.
- Let's just go.

46:18.219 --> 46:20.460
Did you see the news about Olaf?

46:21.580 --> 46:24.980
- Poor guy.
- You're feeling sorry for that prick?

46:26.500 --> 46:30.739
Life is a trial, even for kings.

46:33.739 --> 46:36.900
What do you think about the fact that
the Volva was with him in the car?

46:37.580 --> 46:42.179
She probably had a hand in the
planting of Magnus's remains.

46:42.779 --> 46:47.020
If we can prove that,
you're a free man.

46:48.900 --> 46:52.619
Hi. You can lie down here
and make yourself comfortable.

46:53.020 --> 46:56.659
And unbutton your trousers.

47:00.139 --> 47:02.699
There.
This might be a little cold.

47:07.420 --> 47:08.739
Hi!

47:09.540 --> 47:15.580
Are the confiscated objects from Olaf
Haraldsson's crash held here with us?

48:24.179 --> 48:29.299
Enginnsdottir's DNA finally got a match
on the police database.

48:30.739 --> 48:31.739
What?

48:31.819 --> 48:33.100
The reason why we got a match

48:33.179 --> 48:36.699
is because we included
the staff registry this time.

48:36.779 --> 48:38.219
Who?

48:42.500 --> 48:44.420
According to our analysis,

48:44.500 --> 48:49.299
she has a 25 % match with Lars Haaland.

48:58.540 --> 49:01.699
Look how pretty it is.
