01:01.880 --> 01:06.192
This is an SOS distress call
from the mining ship Red Dwarf,

01:06.280 --> 01:09.670
The crew are dead, killed by a radiation leak,

01:09.760 --> 01:13.992
The only survivors were Dave Lister,
who was in suspended animation,

01:14.080 --> 01:17.755
and his pregnant cat,
who was safely sealed in the hold,

01:17.840 --> 01:19.831
Revived three million years later,

01:19.920 --> 01:22.957
Lister's only companions are
a life form who evolved from his cat

01:23.080 --> 01:25.674
and Arnold Rimmer, a hologram
simulation of one of the crew,

01:28.480 --> 01:31.756
We've travelled through the galaxy
for three million years,

01:31.840 --> 01:35.469
and discovered
that the highest form of life is Man

01:35.560 --> 01:40.031
and the lowest is a man
who works for the post office,

01:48.520 --> 01:54.914
Oh, Jim, didn't you say
we have to seize our moments?

01:56.920 --> 02:01.835
This is our moment, right here
and now, Let's seize it together,

02:01.920 --> 02:05.117
But, darling, I'm dying!

02:05.200 --> 02:08.954
I know, Carol,
Dr Graham told me everything,

02:12.200 --> 02:15.795
- Busy, are you, Dave?
- Hol! I'm watchi ng the film.

02:15.880 --> 02:19.077
- Just wondered if you were bored,
- No, no.

02:19.160 --> 02:22.709
- You're not bored, then?
- No, go away!

02:22.800 --> 02:26.793
But, darling, I'm dying!

02:26.880 --> 02:30.714
I know, Carol,
Dr Graham told me everything,

02:34.120 --> 02:36.429
I've just finished reading everything,

02:36.520 --> 02:39.717
I've now read everything written
by anyone ever,

02:39.800 --> 02:43.270
- Go away!
- You know what the worst book ever is?

02:43.360 --> 02:47.876
- I don't care!
- "It's A Funny Old Game" by Kevin Keegan,

02:47.960 --> 02:50.030
Let me watch the film.

02:54.000 --> 02:58.198
I'm at a loose end, I don't know what to do,

02:58.280 --> 03:00.635
Why don't you read everything again?

03:00.720 --> 03:05.396
I thought I might pass the time
creating a perfect replica of a woman,

03:05.480 --> 03:08.552
capable of independent decision-making
and abstract thought,

03:08.640 --> 03:11.712
and absolutely undetectable
from the real thing,

03:11.800 --> 03:14.473
- Why don't you?
- I don't know how,

03:16.000 --> 03:19.117
I couldn't even make the nose,

03:19.200 --> 03:22.636
- Is there something you want?
- If you're not busy,

03:22.720 --> 03:26.190
- Would you erase some of my memory?
- What for?

03:26.280 --> 03:31.115
If you erase the Agatha Christie novels,
I can read 'em again tonight,

03:31.200 --> 03:34.909
- How do I do it?
- Just type "holmem",

03:35.000 --> 03:36.991
"Password override, "

03:37.080 --> 03:40.959
Then "novels, Christie, Agatha ",
Then press erase,

03:43.000 --> 03:44.990
- I've done it.
- Done what?

03:47.360 --> 03:49.794
- Erased Agatha Christie.
- Who's she, then?

03:49.880 --> 03:55.113
You just asked me to erase all Agatha
Christie novels from your memory.

03:55.200 --> 03:57.236
Why? I've never heard of her,

03:57.320 --> 04:01.836
That's because I've just erased her
from your smegging memory.

04:01.920 --> 04:04.832
- Why'd you do that?
- You asked me to!

04:04.920 --> 04:06.399
- When?
- Just now!

04:06.480 --> 04:09.199
- I don't remember,
- I'm going to bed.

04:09.280 --> 04:11.475
This'll go on all night.

04:11.560 --> 04:13.118
I'm dying!

04:13.200 --> 04:17.159
I know, Carol,
Dr Graham told me everything,

04:21.800 --> 04:23.313
Off!

04:23.400 --> 04:25.391
Had a good day, Lister?

04:25.480 --> 04:28.950
Scrummed enough choccies?
Watched enough drivel, have you?

04:29.040 --> 04:32.430
You're turning into a sad middle-aged woman.

04:32.520 --> 04:36.513
Next, you'll be varnishing your nails
and buying girdles.

04:36.600 --> 04:39.353
And what've you done that's so great?

04:39.440 --> 04:42.910
I've achieved 17 things off my daily goal list,

04:43.000 --> 04:45.719
whereas you've never achieved anything ever.

04:45.800 --> 04:48.712
- I went to the officers' block.
- When?

04:48.800 --> 04:51.951
- This morning.
- But it hasn't been decontaminated!

04:52.040 --> 04:56.989
- You said it had last week!
- No, it was on last Thursday's list!

04:57.080 --> 04:59.719
- And you haven't done it yet?!
- Tomorrow.

04:59.800 --> 05:05.318
It's on tomorrow's daily goal list.
Item 34, right after "learn Portuguese".

05:05.400 --> 05:07.994
Thanks a lot. Don't tell me.

05:08.080 --> 05:10.958
Why were you mooching around
up there, anyway?

05:11.040 --> 05:13.952
I was looking
through Kochanski's dream recorder.

05:14.040 --> 05:16.679
She dreamed about me three times.

05:16.760 --> 05:19.035
So? Clean my teeth, please, Holly.

05:19.120 --> 05:22.795
You don't dream about someone
that you don't feel for.

05:23.240 --> 05:28.155
I once dreamed about a baboon.
It doesn't mean I want to sleep with it.

05:28.240 --> 05:31.596
- Must've meant something.
- Shave, please, Holly.

05:31.680 --> 05:35.673
Lister, you should take
a good long look at yourself,

05:35.760 --> 05:39.878
then you'd see just how ridiculous
you appear to other people.

05:40.880 --> 05:45.431
If you'd let me have Kochanski's
personality disk, I could find out.

05:45.520 --> 05:49.149
If you were a Love Celibate,
you wouldn't have these problems.

05:49.240 --> 05:53.597
You only knocked around with those prats
from the Love Celibacy Society

05:53.680 --> 05:56.240
because you could never get a date.

05:56.320 --> 06:00.472
No, I agree with their philosophy
that love is a sickness

06:00.560 --> 06:04.348
that holds back your career
and takes all your money.

06:04.440 --> 06:07.671
You let your mum buy your "casual" clothes.

06:07.760 --> 06:10.638
There's nothing wrong with my casual clothes.

06:10.720 --> 06:15.157
Your trousers were so short,
you could see your knees.

06:15.240 --> 06:18.312
What about Yvonne McGruder?
That was a date.

06:18.400 --> 06:23.474
She'd been hit on the head by a winch.
She had concussion.

06:23.560 --> 06:25.551
She was crazy about me.

06:25.640 --> 06:29.235
- She called you Norman.
- She went to bed with me.

06:29.320 --> 06:32.630
Yeah, because she thought
you were somebody else.

06:32.720 --> 06:35.792
Serves her right
for being concussed, doesn't it?

06:35.880 --> 06:38.599
Rimmer! You don't know what love is.

06:38.680 --> 06:42.912
Yes, I do. Love is a device
invented by bank managers

06:43.000 --> 06:45.070
to make us overdrawn.

06:45.160 --> 06:46.957
Lights.

06:47.680 --> 06:49.910
Rimmer, love is...

06:50.000 --> 06:53.709
Love is what makes us different from animals.

06:53.800 --> 06:56.439
What makes us different from animals

06:56.520 --> 07:00.718
is we don't use our tongues
to clean our own genitals.

07:14.920 --> 07:18.674
Lights!
Rimmer, are you awake?

07:18.760 --> 07:21.035
Rimmer! Are you awake?

07:21.120 --> 07:24.590
What? Yes, Mum, I'm just packing my satchel.

07:27.120 --> 07:32.240
- Where am I? What time is it?
- I don't feel very well.

07:32.320 --> 07:34.959
- Half past three?!
- I feel really ill.

07:35.040 --> 07:37.076
Well, you are really ill.

07:37.160 --> 07:39.435
No, I mean REALLY ill.

07:41.160 --> 07:46.280
I'm going down to the medical unit.
I don't feel very well.

07:48.480 --> 07:49.879
Lights.

07:49.960 --> 07:52.394
Ah, Miss McGruder, where were we?

08:02.720 --> 08:04.711
I feel really hot.

08:07.240 --> 08:09.834
Hey, this is mine. That's mine.

08:09.920 --> 08:14.118
All this is mine. I'm claiming all this as mine.

08:16.120 --> 08:19.396
Except that bit. I don't want that bit.

08:19.480 --> 08:23.075
But all the rest of this is mine.

08:23.160 --> 08:25.515
This has been a good day.

08:25.600 --> 08:30.515
I've eaten five times, slept six times
and made lots of things mine.

08:30.600 --> 08:36.232
Tomorrow, I'm gonna see if I can't have
sex with something. Aow! Yeah!

08:36.320 --> 08:40.279
# S-E-X, you know I want it! Aow!

08:40.360 --> 08:43.591
# S-E-X, I'm gonna get it!

08:43.679 --> 08:48.071
# S-E-X, I think I found it... #

08:48.160 --> 08:50.151
Oh, it's you!

08:50.240 --> 08:52.515
Hey, monkey, you're sick.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.795
Sick, helpless and unconscious.

08:54.880 --> 08:58.316
If you weren't my friend, I'd steal your shoes.

08:58.400 --> 09:00.994
Time for a snack.

09:01.080 --> 09:03.310
This way. Aow!

09:03.880 --> 09:05.871
Emergency,

09:05.960 --> 09:08.076
There's an emergency going on,

09:08.160 --> 09:10.151
It's still going on,

09:11.480 --> 09:13.471
It's still an emergency,

09:13.560 --> 09:16.950
Will Arnold Rimmer please hurry
to White Corridor 159?

09:17.040 --> 09:19.031
This is an emergency announcement,

09:19.480 --> 09:21.277
Food!

09:21.360 --> 09:24.158
Today's speciality
is chicken Marengo,

09:25.880 --> 09:30.396
# I'm gonna eat you, little chickie,
I'm gonna eat you, little chickie.

09:30.480 --> 09:33.278
# I'm gonna eat you, little chickie #

09:34.480 --> 09:36.869
Ah-ah, too slow, chicken Marengo.

09:36.960 --> 09:39.190
Too slow for this cat.

09:40.440 --> 09:43.716
Hey! This chicken's faster than I thought!

09:47.040 --> 09:49.600
Quick! Lister's fainted! He needs help!

09:53.520 --> 09:57.593
Didn't you hear me? Lister's in trouble.

09:57.680 --> 10:02.515
The monkey - ooh-ooh-ooh! -
has fainted. Quick! Come now.

10:07.000 --> 10:10.072
Is there something wrong with you?
Lister's collapsed!

10:10.160 --> 10:12.720
- Yeah?
- He needs help!

10:12.800 --> 10:15.075
- And?
- And he might die.

10:15.160 --> 10:18.994
Aw, no! That's too bad.
I really liked him, too.

10:19.080 --> 10:22.356
- So, come and help him.
- And interrupt my lunch?!

10:22.440 --> 10:25.477
What's more important,
his life or smegging lunch?

10:25.560 --> 10:28.313
That doesn't even deserve an answer.

10:30.440 --> 10:34.638
Right. OK. You come with me.
You get a stretcher.

10:39.160 --> 10:41.390
Down. Down. Stop.

10:41.480 --> 10:43.914
Let the medicomp take my temperature.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.070
Lister, they've got to learn.

10:46.160 --> 10:48.993
Down, down... Slowly...

10:49.080 --> 10:53.073
Ah, now very, very, very slowly forward.

10:53.160 --> 10:57.438
- Ah! My eye!
- Lister, they've got to learn.

10:57.520 --> 11:01.115
- I nearly lost an eye!
- How about an anal reading?

11:01.200 --> 11:04.431
- I feel fine now.
- Well, you're not fine.

11:04.520 --> 11:08.957
It's your own smegging fault
for going up to the officers' deck.

11:09.040 --> 11:12.874
- I just wanted a look around.
- In Kochanski's quarters,

11:12.960 --> 11:15.110
and look what's it got you.

11:15.200 --> 11:17.760
I've got a touch of pneumonia.

11:17.840 --> 11:20.957
Three million years ago, it was pneumonia.

11:21.200 --> 11:24.829
- Since then, it's mutated.
- Why didn't I ask her out?

11:24.920 --> 11:27.115
What's the worst she could've said?

11:27.200 --> 11:30.954
She could've said, "No, you're a filthy,
greasy, disgusting object

11:31.040 --> 11:33.315
"I wouldn't be seen dead with. "

11:33.400 --> 11:36.039
She could've said yes.
Stranger things have happened.

11:36.120 --> 11:38.270
Only two spring to mind -

11:38.360 --> 11:42.069
the spontaneous combustion
of the Mayor of Warsaw in 1546

11:42.160 --> 11:46.676
and that incident in 12th-century
Burgundy when it rained herring.

11:47.960 --> 11:51.839
There's this theory I had.
Everyone's got two people inside,

11:51.920 --> 11:53.911
your confidence and your paranoia.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.834
Your confidence goes, "You're great.
You're sexy! Everybody loves you!"

11:57.920 --> 12:01.959
Your paranoia says, "You're stupid,
useless and everybody hates you. "

12:02.040 --> 12:06.352
That's odd, Lister. According
to this reading, you're clinically dead.

12:06.440 --> 12:10.956
My confidence would be just about
to persuade me to ask Kochanski out,

12:11.040 --> 12:15.397
and as I walked up to her,
he'd go off to Hawaii.

12:15.480 --> 12:19.473
I'd be left with paranoia,
saying, "She'll laugh in our face. "

12:19.560 --> 12:23.633
Sometimes, Lister, you can be quite
perceptive and thought-provoking.

12:23.720 --> 12:28.032
Other times, like this,
you rant like a complete loony.

12:28.640 --> 12:32.235
- Just take me to me bed.
- All right, Lister.

12:32.320 --> 12:37.952
OK, you now how it works.
Release the mechanism very, very gently.

12:40.400 --> 12:42.595
Possibly a gnat's more gently than that.

12:45.240 --> 12:47.800
Quick! Get an umbrella! Get an umbrella!

12:49.680 --> 12:52.399
Get an umbrella! Get an umbrella!

12:55.880 --> 12:57.677
Get an umbrella!

12:58.920 --> 13:00.717
Get an umbrella!

13:04.800 --> 13:08.998
Necrobics. Hologramatic exercises for the dead.

13:09.080 --> 13:11.958
It's raining! It's raining! Get an umbrella!

13:15.000 --> 13:17.195
It's raining. It's raining...

13:45.680 --> 13:47.830
Holly, what's going on?

13:47.920 --> 13:49.512
- What?
- What's happening?

13:49.600 --> 13:52.956
Um, Hercule Poirot's
just stepped off the train,

13:53.040 --> 13:55.918
Ifyou ask me, they all did it,

13:56.000 --> 14:01.836
Why do we have you? We'd be better off
with a bucket of slop.

14:01.920 --> 14:07.278
If you've got a complaint, just come out
with it, Don't hide behind hyperbole,

14:07.360 --> 14:12.559
- Why is it raining fish?
- I'd be lying if I said I knew,

14:12.640 --> 14:16.952
The only comparable incident
is in 12th-century Burgundy,

14:23.760 --> 14:27.548
It's really going to be one of those days.

14:40.920 --> 14:43.150
Hey, you're awake!

14:43.240 --> 14:46.312
- I just woke up.
- I've brought some presents!

14:46.400 --> 14:50.075
- You shouldn't have bothered.
- Well, I'm that kind of guy!

14:50.160 --> 14:53.550
Let's see what we've got
in the magic bag.

14:53.640 --> 14:56.108
I got you some grapes,

14:56.200 --> 15:02.070
- and I got you got you an orange.
- Thanks. I feel better already.

15:02.160 --> 15:08.633
Well, all this enormous generosity
has made me tired. I'm going to bed.

15:11.520 --> 15:13.511
Ah, yes, indeedy.

15:13.960 --> 15:17.316
- You're awake.
- But I'll be asleep in a minute.

15:17.400 --> 15:22.076
- How do you feel?
- Fine, but I'm trying to sleep!

15:22.160 --> 15:25.630
Shut up, you stupid moggy!
Out of that bed!

15:25.720 --> 15:29.998
Well, I'm gonna take my presents back!

15:30.080 --> 15:32.355
- How do you feel?
- Hurt!

15:34.200 --> 15:38.079
- I feel great.
- Listen, Lister, you had a fever.

15:38.160 --> 15:41.152
- Yeah.
- And you started to hallucinate.

15:41.240 --> 15:45.597
- Yeah?
- Only your hallucinations... were solid.

15:45.680 --> 15:49.070
- What do you mean?
- They were real, alive, solid.

15:49.160 --> 15:50.718
- Solid?
- Solid.

15:50.800 --> 15:54.998
- What do you mean?!
- OK, I'll put it another way.

15:55.080 --> 15:57.719
- You had hallucinations, all right?
- Yeah.

15:57.800 --> 16:00.519
And they were solid.

16:00.600 --> 16:04.593
I told you it wasn't ordinary pneumonia.
It was mutated.

16:04.680 --> 16:08.229
- I knew something would happen.
- What did I hallucinate?

16:08.320 --> 16:14.031
- Well, first of all, it was fish rain.
- Fish rain? Yeah, I dreamt that!

16:14.120 --> 16:16.156
- It happened.
- Where's the fish?

16:16.240 --> 16:18.231
Somebody ate them!

16:19.920 --> 16:23.595
Then the Mayor of Warsaw
spontaneously combusted.

16:24.600 --> 16:28.559
And then you hallucinated two men
in the Drive Room.

16:28.640 --> 16:31.518
- What two men?
- Apparently, one's your confidence

16:31.600 --> 16:33.272
and the other's your paranoia.

16:39.920 --> 16:41.956
See what I mean, Lister?

16:42.040 --> 16:44.349
Hey! It's the king!

16:44.440 --> 16:46.431
Mr Beautiful!

16:46.520 --> 16:50.513
What's the "H" for? Horace?
A chair for the king, Horace.

16:50.600 --> 16:53.160
And breakfast. Mr Wonderful wishes to dine.

16:53.240 --> 16:57.631
Have you lost weight?
You look great. Is he perfect or what?

16:57.720 --> 17:01.508
- You're my confidence?
- That accent makes me go all wibbly!

17:01.600 --> 17:07.277
You look like the manager of the London Jets,
but sound like a quiz show host.

17:07.359 --> 17:11.433
I'm all the things you associate
with confidence, King.

17:11.520 --> 17:15.559
- And you're my paranoia?
- Is that a urine stain?

17:15.640 --> 17:19.679
- What? No, it isn't. It's tea.
- So, how are you, anyway?

17:19.760 --> 17:23.548
Isn't that a spot appearing
on your so-called face?

17:23.640 --> 17:27.315
My God, you've got fat. Must be all that lager.

17:27.400 --> 17:29.789
Bet you've got a terminal disease.

17:29.880 --> 17:33.429
Always happens to people who least expect it.

17:33.520 --> 17:37.308
Say hello, won't you?
I'm only trying to be friendly.

17:37.400 --> 17:40.233
Baby, baby, what can I say?

17:40.320 --> 17:44.154
Is he the greatest guy ever or am I insane?

17:44.240 --> 17:47.789
You're insane. Lister, what are you going to do?

17:47.880 --> 17:50.553
- What can I do?
- Let's arrest them.

17:50.640 --> 17:53.677
- What for?
- For being hallucinations.

17:53.760 --> 17:55.796
Come on, smeghead. It's company.

17:55.880 --> 17:57.871
Lister, you're still sick.

17:57.960 --> 18:00.679
These two are symptoms of your disease.

18:00.760 --> 18:04.116
They're the spots in measles,
the swellings in mumps,

18:04.200 --> 18:06.919
the funny walk in cystitis.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.833
Until they're gone, you won't be better.

18:09.920 --> 18:16.314
Hey, now I know what the "H" stands for.
"Hidiot"! Am I right?

18:16.400 --> 18:19.790
You are treading a very thin line, me laddo.

18:19.880 --> 18:23.953
The "H" stands for "Hologram".
I happen to be dead.

18:24.040 --> 18:26.918
Couldn't happen to a more deserving guy.

18:27.000 --> 18:30.356
Come on, King.
Forget those losers. Let's go party.

18:30.440 --> 18:32.317
- No, I forbid it!
- Why?

18:32.400 --> 18:36.996
Why do you never listen to Mr Rimmer?
He's much more experienced,

18:37.080 --> 18:40.117
more level-headed,
so much... better than you.

18:40.200 --> 18:45.797
Listen, no one tells the Prince
of Charisma what to do. Right, Prince?

18:45.880 --> 18:48.394
- Yeah, right!
- That's my Davey-boy!

18:49.760 --> 18:53.514
He's socialising with a figment
of his imagination.

18:53.600 --> 18:54.999
Yes.

18:56.120 --> 19:01.558
Dust storm approaching,
The ship exterior is now out of bounds,

19:01.640 --> 19:04.552
All airlocks are being automatically sealed,

19:04.640 --> 19:07.393
Estimated duration; 1* hours,

19:07.880 --> 19:11.509
#.. our love I tried to ki ndle

19:11.600 --> 19:16.196
# li ke fi relight, it... dwindled

19:16.280 --> 19:24.278
# Now I wonder when this... wind'll
ever stop #

19:27.280 --> 19:31.114
- You wrote that?
- Yeah, but it was ages ago.

19:31.200 --> 19:35.034
- That is the greatest love song ever.
- Come on!

19:35.120 --> 19:37.839
Ever! It's so deep. The images!

19:37.920 --> 19:42.357
The dwindling, the kindling,
all the indling! I love that stuff!

19:42.440 --> 19:47.070
When I think there's fast-buck merchants
like Beethoven and Mozart out there,

19:47.160 --> 19:51.153
grabbing the publicity, and here's you,
writing pieces of that calibre,

19:51.240 --> 19:53.231
it makes me wanna weep.

19:53.320 --> 19:58.110
- What are you doing with that butt?
- Oh, you've embarrassed me now.

19:58.200 --> 20:03.593
It's just that your lips have touched it.
The king's kissing lips!

20:03.680 --> 20:08.879
I just wanted some proof that I'd
actually met the Duke of Deliciousness!

20:08.960 --> 20:11.190
You're serious, aren't you?

20:11.280 --> 20:13.999
- Serious about what?
- I'm a nobody!

20:14.080 --> 20:19.438
Out of 169 people aboard this ship,
I ranked 169. Bottom of the pile.

20:19.520 --> 20:22.592
That's because you didn't want that career stuff.

20:22.680 --> 20:26.514
You wanted your farm on Fi ji
with you-know-who.

20:26.600 --> 20:28.591
- If she'd come.
- If?!

20:28.680 --> 20:33.117
And turn down the opportunity
of becoming the envy of all womankind?

20:33.200 --> 20:36.272
- Oh, we'll never know now.
- Why not?

20:36.360 --> 20:38.920
- She's dead.
- So is Rimmer.

20:39.000 --> 20:43.312
Holly can only sustain one hologram,
and Rimmer's hidden the personality disks.

20:43.400 --> 20:46.039
- So? Find them.
- I can't.

20:46.120 --> 20:50.193
King, you can do anything.

20:50.280 --> 20:52.077
Anything!

20:52.280 --> 20:56.910
- .. anything. He can't do anything.
- Oh, I know. I'll bet five.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.912
He used to practise kissing on his own.

21:00.000 --> 21:03.037
- How?
- He made lips out of one hand,

21:03.120 --> 21:06.908
then waggled his thumb
through the gap like a tongue.

21:07.920 --> 21:10.150
That is priceless.

21:10.240 --> 21:14.074
Seventeen years old
and he snogged his own hand.

21:14.160 --> 21:19.518
Once, in front of the whole school,
he called his gym teacher "Daddy".

21:19.600 --> 21:21.750
I could've died with embarrassment.

21:21.840 --> 21:24.229
What a silly thing to do.

21:24.320 --> 21:29.155
- I hate him.
- Then why talk about him so much?

21:29.240 --> 21:33.119
Because he makes my life
one big, humiliating, cringe-making,

21:33.200 --> 21:35.191
guilt-ridden hell!

21:35.280 --> 21:37.999
Now! Stab him! Stab him! Stab him!

21:39.160 --> 21:44.792
Ah, you haven't met Stabhim.
He's one of our skutters.

21:44.880 --> 21:49.351
Stabhim, meet Lister's paranoia.
Lister's paranoia, this is Stabhim.

21:49.440 --> 21:51.431
Yo, Rimmer, we've been thinking.

21:51.520 --> 21:54.910
We might get Kochanski back
without turning you off.

21:55.000 --> 21:58.231
Oh, he's drunk. I can smell it from here.

21:58.320 --> 22:02.552
If we turn off all unnecessary systems,
Holly says it'll work.

22:02.640 --> 22:06.838
Another great idea from the people
who brought you beer milkshakes!

22:06.920 --> 22:09.798
You're obsessed with a girl you hardly know.

22:09.880 --> 22:13.509
Hardly knows her?
You haven't heard the "indling" song!

22:13.600 --> 22:16.990
- # Our love I tried to kindle... #
- Not now!

22:17.720 --> 22:20.712
- You're not having her disk.
- Because she'll outrank you?

22:20.800 --> 22:25.271
But she's a bright, good-looking,
witty, upwardly mobile officer.

22:25.360 --> 22:27.669
Why should she fancy you?

22:27.760 --> 22:31.389
- Yes, why should she fancy you?
- Yeah, why should she?

22:31.480 --> 22:34.836
Hmm? Sorry, I was just thinking
about that song.

22:34.920 --> 22:39.436
I can't get it out of my head.
Why? Because you're great!

22:39.520 --> 22:42.557
You're an incredibly seductive,
charming, charismatic young stud!

22:42.640 --> 22:45.438
Yeah, I forgot. That's why.

22:45.520 --> 22:48.273
You're not having her disk or any disk.

22:48.360 --> 22:51.397
Come on, King. Where would he hide 'em?

22:51.480 --> 22:53.869
- I don't know.
- Yes, you do.

22:53.960 --> 22:57.748
- No, he doesn't.
- Come on, think "winner".

22:59.440 --> 23:01.749
Outside. Outside the ship.

23:02.760 --> 23:06.355
- Er, wrong, actually!
- Where outside?

23:06.440 --> 23:09.671
Well, he'd have to send the skutters...

23:09.760 --> 23:13.036
Wrong, wrong! Absolutely brimming
over with wrongability.

23:13.120 --> 23:17.432
They'd have to be under my nose,
so he could laugh.

23:17.520 --> 23:20.080
Wrong and getting wronger all the time.

23:20.160 --> 23:22.549
Outside our sleeping quarters.

23:22.640 --> 23:25.393
The solar panel outside our sleeping quarters!

23:25.480 --> 23:28.074
You followed me, you goit!

23:28.200 --> 23:30.998
Is that where they are?! That's incredible! I did it!

23:34.960 --> 23:36.757
Lister?

23:45.360 --> 23:48.272
- How long now, Hol?
- Can't be long, Dave,

23:48.360 --> 23:50.828
Hercule has the suspects in one room,

23:50.920 --> 23:54.037
and I'm two pages from "by the same author",

23:54.120 --> 23:56.315
No, Holly. The dust storm.

23:56.400 --> 23:59.710
Oh, that,
Any time now, it's almost subsided,

23:59.800 --> 24:04.715
Yeah, how's my baby boy?
You've got a body like a coat hanger!

24:04.800 --> 24:07.712
You make a spacesuit look like eveningwear.

24:07.800 --> 24:12.112
- Let me ask you one question?
- It's no use arguing. I'm going.

24:12.200 --> 24:15.954
- Who smashed up the medicomp?
- He's stalling, King. Let's go.

24:16.040 --> 24:18.474
Holly, give him a punch up.

24:18.560 --> 24:21.233
Why would they smash it up?

24:21.320 --> 24:24.437
Lister, come here. Come here.

24:26.480 --> 24:28.471
You are still sick.

24:28.560 --> 24:30.835
- I feel great.
- You will not...

24:31.840 --> 24:33.831
You will not...

24:33.920 --> 24:37.549
You will not be better until they've gone.

24:37.640 --> 24:41.394
They know that, and they've stopped you
getting any treatment.

24:42.920 --> 24:44.911
Where's Paranoia?

24:45.000 --> 24:48.231
I don't know. Is it someplace near Uruguay?

24:48.320 --> 24:50.311
Who is this joker?

24:50.400 --> 24:54.188
- They're germs and they're dangerous.
- The storm has passed, Dave,

24:54.280 --> 24:58.717
- Airlocks are now released,
- What are we waiting for, King?

24:58.800 --> 25:00.597
Nothing.

25:01.720 --> 25:05.998
- Holly, put a trace on Paranoia.
- What's a trace?

25:06.080 --> 25:10.756
- It's space jargon. It means find him.
- You made that up to be cool,

25:11.400 --> 25:15.837
- Where is he?
- Paranoia is no longer on this ship,

25:18.120 --> 25:20.395
Look at that view, Kingo!

25:20.480 --> 25:23.995
On top of the world! Makes you wanna dance!

25:24.080 --> 25:26.071
# Cha, cha-cha

25:26.160 --> 25:27.673
# Cha-cha, cha-cha cha-cha

25:27.760 --> 25:29.716
# Cha, cha-cha

25:29.800 --> 25:31.870
# Cha-cha, cha-cha cha-cha #

25:31.960 --> 25:34.076
Hey, here it is!

25:34.160 --> 25:36.151
# Cha-cha,
cha-cha, cha-cha, cha-cha... #

25:44.360 --> 25:46.351
- Did you hear something?
- Nope.

25:46.440 --> 25:51.116
- In space, no one can hear you cha-cha!
- Could Paranoia be here?

25:51.200 --> 25:54.158
- Forget him.
- He smashed up the medical unit.

25:54.240 --> 25:57.596
- No, he didn't. I did.
- You did?

25:57.680 --> 26:01.719
So we can be together. I did it for you!

26:01.800 --> 26:04.360
- Where did he go, then?
- I killed him.

26:04.440 --> 26:07.000
What do you mean, you killed him?!

26:07.080 --> 26:11.517
Hey, he didn't suffer.
I fed him into the waste grinder

26:11.600 --> 26:14.068
and flushed his bits into space.

26:14.160 --> 26:17.072
Look, I'm gonna go inside now.

26:17.160 --> 26:20.357
Gets a little claustrophobic in these suits.

26:20.440 --> 26:22.590
- Take your helmet off.
- What?!

26:22.680 --> 26:25.911
- Take your helmet off.
- I'll die. There's no oxygen!

26:26.000 --> 26:30.312
- Hey, oxygen's for losers. Come on!
- I need oxygen!

26:30.400 --> 26:34.029
You don't need anything. You're the king!

26:34.120 --> 26:37.271
- You're crazy!
- Who told you you needed oxygen?

26:37.360 --> 26:40.591
Some loser trying to make you feel small.

26:40.680 --> 26:44.355
I'll prove it to you. I'll take mine off first.

26:44.440 --> 26:47.477
- We'll see who's crazy around here!
- No!

27:00.520 --> 27:03.034
- Must you do this now?
- I'm doing my laundry!

27:03.120 --> 27:06.430
- It's totally disgusting.
- What's disgusting?

27:11.440 --> 27:13.431
- Lister.
- Yeah?

27:13.520 --> 27:16.637
I just want to say I was right all along.

27:16.720 --> 27:20.793
- I said they were germs and they were.
- OK. So what?

27:20.880 --> 27:24.395
And I'm saying that disk will bring you misery.

27:24.480 --> 27:26.710
Just remember I said that.

27:26.800 --> 27:31.237
If she comes back and she's not interested,
I can handle it.

27:31.320 --> 27:35.791
Whatever, Lister. That disk
is a one-way ticket to Miseryville.

27:35.880 --> 27:38.838
I spent enough time listening to me paranoia.

27:38.920 --> 27:41.115
Now I'm listening to me confidence.

27:55.840 --> 27:58.400
Hi, Krissie... It's not gonna work.

27:58.480 --> 28:02.075
Hello, Krissie... That's not gonna work either.

28:02.160 --> 28:04.720
Hey! Yo! Krissie!

28:05.440 --> 28:06.953
Hi...

28:12.320 --> 28:15.517
Lister, good luck. I mean it.

28:15.600 --> 28:18.512
- Smeg off.
- No, honestly. Good luck.

28:18.600 --> 28:21.319
OK, Hol. Switch it on.

28:23.920 --> 28:26.832
- Well, he did warn you.
- I certainly did.

28:26.920 --> 28:31.391
Do you honestly think I'd put
Kochanski's disk in Kochanski's box

28:31.480 --> 28:33.789
where any munchkin could find it?

28:33.880 --> 28:37.111
You think you had it bad before, Lister?

28:37.200 --> 28:40.636
Well, now you've got it in stereo, baby.

28:41.840 --> 28:46.436
- Welcome aboard, Rimmsie.
- Nice to be here, you son of a gun.

28:50.520 --> 28:52.317
# It's cold outside

28:52.400 --> 28:54.197
# There's no kind of atmosphere

28:54.280 --> 28:57.636
# I'm all alone, more or less

28:57.720 --> 29:00.837
# Let me fly far away from here

29:00.920 --> 29:03.673
# Fun, fun, fun

29:03.760 --> 29:07.275
# In the sun, sun, sun

29:07.360 --> 29:10.716
# I want to lie, shipwrecked and comatose

29:10.800 --> 29:14.076
# Drinking fresh mango juice

29:14.160 --> 29:17.436
# Goldfish shoals, nibbling at my toes

29:17.520 --> 29:20.193
# Fun, fun, fun

29:20.280 --> 29:23.955
# In the sun, sun, sun

29:24.040 --> 29:26.713
