00:01.242 --> 00:03.031
In the criminal justice system

00:03.098 --> 00:04.592
sexually-based offenses

00:04.666 --> 00:06.160
are considered especially heinous.

00:06.587 --> 00:08.921
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives...

00:08.986 --> 00:10.513
who investigate these vicious felonies

00:10.587 --> 00:12.048
are members of an elite squad

00:12.123 --> 00:14.033
known as the Special Victims Unit.

00:14.107 --> 00:15.383
These are their stories.

00:18.331 --> 00:20.754
Tag and bag as soon as
the detectives are through.

00:20.827 --> 00:22.169
She's been
out here long enough.

00:22.236 --> 00:24.887
What's up, Doc?
Veronica Tandy...

00:24.956 --> 00:28.251
34 years old, stabbed in
the back, raped from behind.

00:28.349 --> 00:30.453
Any fluids?
Not that I can see.

00:30.525 --> 00:33.208
We'll swab. Hopefully,
find traces with the Luma.

00:33.660 --> 00:35.484
I've got a domestic
homicide mid-town...

00:35.550 --> 00:37.939
so I've scheduled the autopsy
later this afternoon.

00:38.014 --> 00:39.869
Don't be late.
Don't be late.

00:41.822 --> 00:43.764
She's got
a bruise on her neck.

00:43.839 --> 00:45.269
She was yoked.

00:45.694 --> 00:49.078
External examination
found no traces of semen.

00:49.759 --> 00:51.253
Further testing...

00:51.327 --> 00:55.190
showed spermicides
usually found in condoms.

00:55.456 --> 00:56.732
This is fun.

00:57.759 --> 00:58.807
Damn.

00:59.007 --> 01:00.088
Problem?

01:00.865 --> 01:03.899
Single fetus present,
seven to eight weeks.

01:04.610 --> 01:06.398
That'll probably
get suppressed at trial.

01:06.465 --> 01:08.668
According to the law,
a fetus is not a person.

01:08.737 --> 01:12.797
The stab wound was 2 inches wide,
8 inches deep, one edge serrated.

01:13.665 --> 01:14.746
That's a big knife.

01:14.819 --> 01:17.153
Cause of death?
Cardiopulmonary failure.

01:17.218 --> 01:20.383
The blade entered the back between
the ribs, collapsing the left lung.

01:20.450 --> 01:21.727
Takes care of any screaming.

01:22.851 --> 01:24.280
Could you grab that?

01:25.667 --> 01:26.682
Morgue.

01:27.811 --> 01:28.988
Be right out.

01:29.667 --> 01:31.523
Husband's here to ID the body.

01:33.636 --> 01:34.880
Mr. Tandy?

01:36.100 --> 01:38.849
I'm Det. Benson
from the Special Victims Unit.

01:39.493 --> 01:40.921
Are you alone?

01:42.373 --> 01:43.682
It's a mistake.

01:45.030 --> 01:47.134
My wife isn't here.

01:48.293 --> 01:49.887
Mr. Tandy...

01:57.255 --> 01:58.913
She's supposed to be home.

01:58.983 --> 02:02.332
She's supposed to be home!
She's supposed to be home!

02:04.000 --> 02:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here

03:00.141 --> 03:04.681
We were supposed to meet last
night at Café des Artistes at 7:00.

03:06.446 --> 03:09.163
When she didn't show up,
I called her assistant...

03:09.615 --> 03:10.956
Charlene.

03:12.400 --> 03:14.308
She said that
she'd left early...

03:14.512 --> 03:15.689
around 4:00.

03:16.336 --> 03:18.026
Did she say
where she was going?

03:18.095 --> 03:20.584
No. I just assumed
she'd be recruiting.

03:21.041 --> 03:22.317
Recruiting for what?

03:22.383 --> 03:24.686
Well, she's
the head of personnel...

03:25.200 --> 03:26.858
for Compugame.

03:27.472 --> 03:29.775
They manufacture
game software.

03:29.840 --> 03:33.703
Had she received any threatening
phone calls or letters recently?

03:34.546 --> 03:36.749
Was she having
any difficulties at work?

03:36.818 --> 03:39.120
Anybody giving her trouble,
a hard time?

03:41.107 --> 03:43.474
People get fired,
they blame her.

03:43.539 --> 03:45.545
But that
just goes with the job.

03:45.618 --> 03:47.081
Anyone in particular?

03:49.396 --> 03:51.818
We tried
not to talk shop at home.

03:55.763 --> 03:57.422
How did...

03:57.491 --> 03:59.347
I mean, how did Ronnie die?

04:02.036 --> 04:03.824
Your wife was stabbed.

04:04.789 --> 04:05.934
I'm sorry.

04:10.165 --> 04:12.304
What am I supposed
to tell our kids?

04:14.614 --> 04:17.964
Is there anyone we can call?
Someone to help you?

04:18.934 --> 04:20.363
Family's on the way.

04:24.023 --> 04:25.364
Mr. Tandy...

04:26.615 --> 04:28.885
were you aware
your wife was pregnant?

04:32.568 --> 04:33.517
What?

04:36.312 --> 04:37.971
What are you talking about?

04:39.449 --> 04:41.336
Did our victim fight back?

04:41.401 --> 04:42.895
Doesn't look like
she had a chance.

04:42.969 --> 04:45.619
Why kill her
if she didn't see his face?

04:45.881 --> 04:48.729
We're thinking it's
one guy here who's escalating?

04:49.274 --> 04:50.932
Or someone she knew.

04:51.002 --> 04:53.238
Head of personnel, probably
made a lot of enemies.

04:53.307 --> 04:55.640
I would start with
whoever was fired recently.

04:55.707 --> 04:58.162
Meanwhile, I'll get
a psych profile working.

05:00.987 --> 05:02.231
Something else?

05:03.996 --> 05:06.417
Why didn't she tell her
husband that she was pregnant?

05:06.492 --> 05:07.921
She was only
seven weeks along.

05:07.996 --> 05:09.523
Maybe she was
waiting for the best time.

05:09.595 --> 05:13.141
Or she may have decided to
terminate, or it wasn't his.

05:14.237 --> 05:17.685
Is your gut telling you that the
grieving husband raped his own wife...

05:17.757 --> 05:19.067
and then brutally shived her?

05:19.133 --> 05:22.134
No, but if she was having an
affair with somebody who decided...

05:22.206 --> 05:25.140
they weren't interested in
continuing the relationship...

05:26.014 --> 05:28.949
Well, let's find out if we
need to establish paternity.

05:32.030 --> 05:34.037
I just can't believe it.

05:34.558 --> 05:35.933
Everyone loved Ronnie.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.374
Even people she axed?

05:37.438 --> 05:39.130
It's not fun to get fired.

05:39.200 --> 05:41.436
Besides, the department heads
make the final cuts.

05:41.535 --> 05:43.357
Don't shoot the messenger,
you know.

05:43.424 --> 05:46.555
Did anybody blame her?
You know, get loud about it?

05:46.625 --> 05:48.119
Yes.
Who?

05:48.193 --> 05:50.265
All of them. We've had...

05:50.336 --> 05:53.403
five terminations
in the past three months.

05:54.016 --> 05:57.366
Should I go back further? No.
We can work with that for now.

05:57.442 --> 05:59.418
The husband mentioned
that the victim left at 4:00.

05:59.489 --> 06:01.278
Do you know where she went?

06:01.346 --> 06:02.327
No.

06:02.913 --> 06:04.889
She said it was personal.

06:05.763 --> 06:08.762
I'm sorry, it's just hard
to hear you call her a victim.

06:12.644 --> 06:15.546
Did Ronnie have any good
friends here at the office?

06:15.620 --> 06:17.889
Teresa Steele in Legal.

06:17.957 --> 06:20.061
They have lunch
together a lot.

06:20.133 --> 06:23.449
And Jason Mayberry in Security.
They'd meet for coffee.

06:23.524 --> 06:25.466
Brought her flowers
and made sure she had a cab

06:25.541 --> 06:26.750
when she worked late.

06:26.821 --> 06:28.195
Is he working today?

06:28.262 --> 06:29.920
He quit two weeks ago.

06:29.989 --> 06:31.298
Do you know why?

06:31.365 --> 06:33.253
No, you'd have to
check with his supervisor.

06:33.318 --> 06:35.555
I don't have access
to his confidential files.

06:35.621 --> 06:37.214
Thank you.
Thank you.

06:39.014 --> 06:42.114
I'll talk to the woman in Legal.
I'll meet you in the lobby.

06:43.399 --> 06:45.919
I've known
Ronnie Tandy for 15 years.

06:46.759 --> 06:49.149
We both started here
fresh out of college.

06:50.888 --> 06:52.545
What do you need to know?

06:52.968 --> 06:54.878
Tell me about Jason Mayberry.

06:55.432 --> 06:56.676
What about him?

06:56.936 --> 06:59.075
I've been told
that they were close.

07:04.393 --> 07:07.591
Ms. Steele, were you aware
that Mrs. Tandy was pregnant?

07:09.066 --> 07:10.047
No.

07:11.370 --> 07:13.607
But she wasn't having
an affair with Jason Mayberry

07:13.674 --> 07:15.201
if that's
what you're thinking.

07:15.274 --> 07:17.479
Well, you didn't know that
she was expecting,

07:17.546 --> 07:18.954
so how can you be so sure?

07:19.018 --> 07:20.328
I guess I can't.

07:22.699 --> 07:24.455
Ronnie was a bleeding heart.

07:25.740 --> 07:27.496
She liked to
help people get ahead.

07:27.564 --> 07:29.866
She encouraged Jason
to go back to school...

07:29.932 --> 07:31.906
find his niche.
Nothing wrong with that.

07:31.980 --> 07:34.152
So why are you
insinuating otherwise?

07:34.220 --> 07:36.162
Well, I'm just
asking questions.

07:36.396 --> 07:39.047
Jason Mayberry sent her
flowers. They met for coffee...

07:39.116 --> 07:40.840
She wrote
letters of recommendation,

07:40.909 --> 07:42.949
talked to a few people
on his behalf.

07:43.117 --> 07:44.644
I expect he felt grateful.

07:44.718 --> 07:46.376
Recommendations for what?

07:46.670 --> 07:48.874
To attend the Police Academy.

07:49.677 --> 07:51.915
Jason just suddenly quit.
He was good at the job.

07:51.982 --> 07:55.016
Took pride in it. Could've been a
supervisor in another six months.

07:55.086 --> 07:56.014
Why did he quit?

07:56.079 --> 07:57.988
Working security
is not exactly a glamour job

07:58.063 --> 07:59.625
and the pay
is right at minimum.

07:59.695 --> 08:01.932
But to guess, I'd say he quit
because he was embarrassed.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.237
Embarrassed about what?
His mother. You know the type.

08:04.304 --> 08:07.271
Can't cut the strings. Called
a lot. Came down here once.

08:07.345 --> 08:09.167
Busted his chops
right in front of us.

08:09.231 --> 08:10.858
Never could hold
his head up after that.

08:10.928 --> 08:13.416
You can take your break. Do you
know where Jason's working now?

08:13.488 --> 08:14.536
Nope.

08:14.961 --> 08:16.074
Address?

08:16.145 --> 08:18.480
Got one here in Jersey. Why?

08:18.544 --> 08:20.007
He and Mrs. Tandy
were close friends.

08:20.082 --> 08:21.675
He might know whether
anyone was bothering her.

08:21.746 --> 08:23.371
I can tell you that.

08:23.441 --> 08:24.849
Greg Spector
couldn't stand her.

08:24.913 --> 08:27.302
He was a guard supervisor
up until a month ago.

08:27.378 --> 08:28.622
She fire him?

08:28.690 --> 08:30.829
Jason turned him
into Mrs. Tandy.

08:30.899 --> 08:32.787
Accused Greg of
using the security cameras

08:32.850 --> 08:34.826
to zoom in
on women's body parts.

08:37.043 --> 08:38.702
You got an address for him?

08:38.772 --> 08:41.073
He's working janitorial
at LaGuardia.

08:41.524 --> 08:44.306
A little pet tells a lie,
and I get canned.

08:44.660 --> 08:47.180
It was a good job,
$15 an hour.

08:47.252 --> 08:49.292
You get in her face? You
have words? You threaten her?

08:49.365 --> 08:51.536
I didn't threaten. I said
I wasn't going without a fight

08:51.605 --> 08:53.394
and that she'd be sorry.

08:53.461 --> 08:55.349
She's sorry. She's dead.

08:57.365 --> 09:00.016
Is that true?
Where were you last night?

09:00.534 --> 09:03.120
I was home alone.
I had nothing to do with this.

09:03.191 --> 09:05.078
Greg, this does not
look good for you.

09:05.142 --> 09:06.669
I'm telling you,
I didn't do it.

09:06.743 --> 09:08.531
Ronnie came to see me
about a week ago.

09:08.600 --> 09:11.283
About what?
My side of the story.

09:11.351 --> 09:14.646
I was the one who caught Jason
using the security camera.

09:14.713 --> 09:16.370
Next thing I know,
I'm fired.

09:16.440 --> 09:18.829
So what made her call you in?
I don't know.

09:18.905 --> 09:22.068
She said something
about getting me reinstated.

09:22.137 --> 09:25.453
I got the impression that he
wasn't her little pet anymore.

09:31.257 --> 09:33.680
Jason hasn't lived here
for two years.

09:34.266 --> 09:37.234
He doesn't like it here.
It reminds him of his father.

09:39.098 --> 09:41.138
He died
when Jason was five.

09:41.403 --> 09:43.257
Do you have
a current address?

09:43.611 --> 09:45.138
I am his mother.

09:45.275 --> 09:47.380
We'll need to speak
with your son, Mrs. Mayberry.

09:47.451 --> 09:48.760
Concerning what?

09:49.372 --> 09:50.680
It's a police matter.

09:51.579 --> 09:52.824
What has he done?

09:52.892 --> 09:55.478
We just need to ask him
some routine questions.

09:58.940 --> 10:02.007
I don't like
cryptic conversations.

10:02.077 --> 10:06.583
They require a prevaricating
nature, which I do not possess.

10:07.294 --> 10:10.774
So either you tell me
what this is all about...

10:10.846 --> 10:14.163
or you can locate Jason
using whatever means...

10:14.239 --> 10:16.343
you have at your disposal.

10:16.415 --> 10:18.684
Do you know
what obstruction is, ma'am?

10:18.943 --> 10:20.438
This is
a murder investigation,

10:20.511 --> 10:22.104
and we need to
speak with your son.

10:22.176 --> 10:23.124
Now.

10:31.041 --> 10:32.186
Police.

10:32.832 --> 10:34.076
Just a minute.

10:40.897 --> 10:41.945
Yes?

10:42.017 --> 10:45.247
I'm Det. Benson. This is
my partner, Det. Stabler.

10:45.314 --> 10:47.703
We're working
on the Veronica Tandy murder.

10:48.451 --> 10:50.753
Yeah, I know. I heard.

10:51.458 --> 10:53.498
It's awful.
Do you know what happened?

10:53.570 --> 10:55.545
Well, we'd like to
ask you a few questions.

10:55.619 --> 10:57.474
Do you mind
if we step inside?

10:59.012 --> 11:01.183
Well, it's a mess.

11:01.250 --> 11:02.462
We don't mind.

11:03.108 --> 11:04.057
I do.

11:05.764 --> 11:07.619
Well, tell you what.

11:07.685 --> 11:09.954
We can bring you on down to
the precinct, fill you in there.

11:12.772 --> 11:14.179
Greg Spector.

11:15.045 --> 11:16.420
He hated her.

11:16.486 --> 11:18.242
We've already talked to him.

11:20.549 --> 11:21.694
Well.

11:21.765 --> 11:24.701
I don't really see
how I can help you then.

11:26.566 --> 11:27.612
Jason.

11:28.872 --> 11:32.035
We really need your help.
We're running out of leads.

11:34.280 --> 11:36.036
Help us find this guy...

11:36.744 --> 11:38.118
for Veronica.

11:44.073 --> 11:45.021
Okay.

11:46.153 --> 11:47.713
Anything for her.

11:54.121 --> 11:56.576
This is Dr. George Huang...

11:56.649 --> 11:59.946
psychiatrist on loan from
the FBI, setting up VICAP.

12:00.202 --> 12:01.479
This is Det. Olivia Benson.

12:01.546 --> 12:03.204
Nice to meet you.
How do you do?

12:03.274 --> 12:04.933
And Elliot Stabler.
Hi.

12:05.642 --> 12:06.821
Well, what do you got?

12:06.890 --> 12:08.832
Well, we're thinking
Jason's our guy.

12:08.907 --> 12:12.136
He agreed to chat with us. So we'll
sit with him, try and break him.

12:12.203 --> 12:14.473
Det. Stabler
should do this alone.

12:15.051 --> 12:16.328
Excuse me?

12:16.459 --> 12:18.315
Your man
has a problem with women.

12:18.380 --> 12:20.388
If this is your guy, he's
never going to open up to you.

12:20.461 --> 12:22.916
All rapists
have a problem with women.

12:22.989 --> 12:25.837
I'll sit this one out, but you're
not telling us anything new, Doctor.

12:25.901 --> 12:30.091
The man who did this is extremely
shy and frequently excited.

12:30.157 --> 12:33.125
He attacks women from behind
with yoking and frottage.

12:33.198 --> 12:35.021
He graduated
to rape and murder.

12:35.085 --> 12:38.403
Blitz attacks from behind are
acts of concealment, not shyness.

12:39.054 --> 12:40.364
Is your man bold?

12:40.911 --> 12:42.470
Do people notice him?

12:42.639 --> 12:43.948
Or is he humble?

12:44.463 --> 12:45.805
Eager to please?

12:46.671 --> 12:47.620
Even...

12:49.519 --> 12:50.469
shy.

12:51.888 --> 12:54.191
I'll stick around
for the interrogation.

13:00.145 --> 13:03.528
Well, it turns out that our suspect
applied to the Police Academy...

13:03.601 --> 13:05.129
so we already
have psych tests.

13:05.330 --> 13:06.737
I'll go pick up his file.
Thanks.

13:06.802 --> 13:09.169
Elliot pulls anything needs
checking, we'll call you.

13:09.234 --> 13:10.183
All right.

13:12.819 --> 13:17.162
No disrespect intended,
but Dr. Huang just got here.

13:17.586 --> 13:19.888
Do you believe Jason
is your perp? Yes, I do.

13:19.954 --> 13:21.100
Okay.

13:21.171 --> 13:23.025
We're not going to convict him
on your gut, Elliot.

13:23.091 --> 13:26.059
We don't have any hard evidence,
so we're going to need a confession.

13:26.132 --> 13:27.626
I suggest you
make this suspect your friend,

13:27.701 --> 13:30.351
because he can walk
whenever he wants.

13:40.214 --> 13:41.555
How's your coffee?

13:41.622 --> 13:44.557
It's pretty bad. Coffee's
always bad in the precinct.

13:44.631 --> 13:47.630
You wanna be a cop, you're
gonna have to get used to it.

13:48.022 --> 13:49.396
How did you know about that?

13:49.463 --> 13:51.317
Pretty small company, Jason.

13:51.383 --> 13:53.074
People talk about comers.

13:53.399 --> 13:54.415
"Comers?"

13:54.615 --> 13:57.233
Guys on the fast track,
going places, doing things.

13:57.303 --> 13:59.692
You got a rabbi, you're
on your way. That's what...

13:59.768 --> 14:01.623
us cops call...

14:02.103 --> 14:05.453
a guardian angel that oversees
career moves on the force.

14:06.360 --> 14:08.564
A rabbi. Did you know that?

14:08.889 --> 14:10.066
No.

14:10.552 --> 14:14.230
So when do you start the Academy?
They haven't called me yet.

14:16.601 --> 14:18.008
There's gotta be
a snag in there.

14:18.073 --> 14:20.758
Tell you what, I'm gonna
look into it for you.

14:21.947 --> 14:25.111
Where are you working in the
meantime? Fortress Armored Cars.

14:25.178 --> 14:27.034
Just short term
till I get the call.

14:27.099 --> 14:28.507
Good job. Pay well?

14:28.571 --> 14:30.197
No, not during training.

14:31.132 --> 14:32.626
So why'd you
quit your last job?

14:32.700 --> 14:35.188
I heard you were
up for shift supervisor.

14:36.508 --> 14:39.225
Yeah. Well,
I don't need to work so...

14:41.405 --> 14:44.023
Can't feel very good
having Mommy pay the bills.

14:44.764 --> 14:46.706
She does not pay my bills.

14:47.100 --> 14:48.956
I have a trust.

14:52.029 --> 14:53.458
Why work at all?

14:53.534 --> 14:55.159
To have somewhere to go.

14:55.229 --> 14:56.823
To take pride in something.

14:56.894 --> 14:59.098
Why quit where everyone
respected you...

14:59.166 --> 15:01.076
and recognized
your work ethic?

15:03.198 --> 15:05.435
I'd really rather not say.

15:07.584 --> 15:08.729
Okay.

15:11.039 --> 15:13.428
Maybe you quit
before they could fire you?

15:14.432 --> 15:16.221
They find out
something about you?

15:16.288 --> 15:19.638
Catch you, you know, stealing?
Or sleeping on the job?

15:19.713 --> 15:22.463
Maybe use the security cameras
to zoom in on women's breasts?

15:22.528 --> 15:24.896
Is that your thing, Jason?
Or are you an ass man?

15:24.961 --> 15:26.238
No.

15:26.305 --> 15:27.614
I never did that.

15:27.906 --> 15:29.400
That was Greg Spector.

15:39.555 --> 15:40.984
So why did you quit?

15:48.580 --> 15:50.554
Well, I was... Okay.

15:50.628 --> 15:52.865
I was being sexually harassed.

15:53.988 --> 15:56.835
I liked her. I just didn't
want to get her in any trouble.

15:57.092 --> 15:59.100
So I couldn't
work there anymore.

16:01.701 --> 16:03.939
Sexually harassed by who?

16:06.214 --> 16:07.675
Veronica Tandy.

16:09.734 --> 16:11.458
Det. Benson.

16:12.614 --> 16:14.503
Our camcorder broke.

16:15.783 --> 16:19.328
Mr. Tandy, I'm sorry... Our
camcorder broke three months ago.

16:19.399 --> 16:21.188
My wife bought me a new one.

16:21.319 --> 16:23.043
Big surprise came today.

16:24.903 --> 16:27.522
I know you're upset...
No, you've been digging.

16:28.424 --> 16:31.491
You've been dirtying
my murdered wife's name.

16:33.705 --> 16:35.527
We have to follow leads.

16:38.185 --> 16:39.844
Read the card, Detective.

16:40.106 --> 16:42.473
Mr. Tandy I had to do my...
Just read it!

16:48.970 --> 16:52.069
"For baby Tandy number four.
Shoot till you drop.

16:52.971 --> 16:54.019
"Love, Ronnie."

16:54.091 --> 16:55.783
She bought the camera...

16:56.908 --> 16:58.216
for our new baby.

16:58.700 --> 17:00.326
Wasn't having an affair.

17:05.740 --> 17:07.233
You satisfied now?

17:15.340 --> 17:18.058
Mayberry passed the written,
just barely passed the physical.

17:18.126 --> 17:20.133
Not exactly buff but, hell,
we need the bodies.

17:20.204 --> 17:22.662
Did he pass the psych exam?
No, not even close.

17:22.733 --> 17:24.971
Profile skewed towards
aggression during stress.

17:25.038 --> 17:27.340
I thought that was normal.
Not at those levels.

17:27.406 --> 17:29.033
We have plenty of cops
on the street

17:29.102 --> 17:31.559
with excessive force
complaints in their files.

17:31.631 --> 17:33.966
Even psychos know how
to pass the psych exam.

17:34.031 --> 17:37.511
Which was why we figured this guy
must be a real secret squirrel.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.527
Look, why is...

17:39.600 --> 17:42.448
Why are there two letters of
recommendation from Veronica Tandy?

17:42.513 --> 17:44.651
One's a glowing review.
One's a rescind letter.

17:44.721 --> 17:46.314
She pulled her support?

17:46.384 --> 17:47.465
Do you know why?

17:47.537 --> 17:50.090
I called to ask her before
the psych report came back.

17:50.161 --> 17:51.884
She never returned my call.

17:53.074 --> 17:55.530
I don't think
I'm helping you at all,

17:55.603 --> 17:57.511
and I'm getting
kind of tired so...

17:57.586 --> 17:59.593
Jason, trust me.
You're being very helpful.

17:59.666 --> 18:02.350
What we're doing here
is called victimology.

18:03.028 --> 18:06.639
Ascertaining character and
personality traits of the victim.

18:06.707 --> 18:08.463
Determine how and why
they were chosen.

18:08.531 --> 18:10.670
Listen to this guy.
You sound like a cop already.

18:10.740 --> 18:13.009
Now, you said that
the victim harassed you.

18:13.075 --> 18:14.832
And why didn't you
turn her in?

18:15.476 --> 18:17.419
She would've lost her job.

18:17.653 --> 18:19.475
She has a family.
Had.

18:19.540 --> 18:22.989
Jason, she only exists in the
memories of people who love her.

18:25.301 --> 18:26.795
They didn't know her.

18:27.670 --> 18:30.605
This comes out, it'll hurt them. Jason.

18:32.022 --> 18:35.056
What we discuss in this room
does not leave here.

18:35.798 --> 18:37.774
Now you sure you didn't
encourage her in some way?

18:37.846 --> 18:39.124
You sent her flowers.

18:39.191 --> 18:40.435
The two of you
met for coffee.

18:40.503 --> 18:42.194
Yes, after she
did me a favor.

18:42.263 --> 18:44.369
She was always
doing me favors.

18:44.439 --> 18:46.993
I thought that was just
the way she was with everyone.

18:47.064 --> 18:48.919
But it wasn't true.

18:48.984 --> 18:50.893
She was hung up on me.

18:50.968 --> 18:53.457
She called me at home.

18:53.528 --> 18:54.838
She dropped by unannounced.

18:54.905 --> 18:56.912
She's a beautiful woman.
Weren't you flattered?

18:56.985 --> 18:58.993
Yeah, sure. At first I was.

18:59.065 --> 19:02.514
But Ronnie
was married with kids.

19:02.585 --> 19:04.308
You disapproved of her.

19:04.442 --> 19:07.311
Married people have no right,
no business fooling around.

19:07.386 --> 19:09.841
You let her run you
out of the company.

19:09.915 --> 19:11.223
She made you
leave your good job.

19:11.291 --> 19:13.528
Why would you do that?
What else was I gonna do?

19:13.595 --> 19:17.140
She imagined this relationship
that did not exist.

19:17.211 --> 19:18.870
And she lied a lot.

19:18.938 --> 19:22.714
That must've made you mad. Yeah,
you just don't know how much.

19:23.260 --> 19:26.293
Look, I sent her thank you
flowers. It's a come on.

19:26.428 --> 19:30.258
I hailed her a cab, she's asking
me to have drinks with her.

19:30.332 --> 19:33.464
You know, she's pregnant. She
shouldn't have been drinking.

19:35.709 --> 19:37.651
How'd you know
she was pregnant?

19:39.166 --> 19:40.507
She told me.

19:43.198 --> 19:45.205
She told you
but not her husband?

19:51.807 --> 19:54.491
She didn't tell anybody else
but you. Is that it?

19:56.320 --> 19:57.880
So what? We were close.

19:59.967 --> 20:01.528
When did she tell you?

20:05.313 --> 20:07.996
I don't remember exactly when.

20:16.578 --> 20:17.788
Take a second.

20:19.393 --> 20:21.336
How about a search warrant,
Counselor?

20:21.410 --> 20:24.258
Based on what? Your gut
or Dr. Huang's supposition?

20:24.323 --> 20:27.355
Well, what do you suggest? Because
he's about ready to walk out that door.

20:28.515 --> 20:30.882
Let him walk.
What did you just say?

20:32.900 --> 20:35.584
Let him walk. That bastard
knew she was pregnant...

20:35.651 --> 20:38.172
and he killed her anyway. He
is not going out of my sight.

20:38.244 --> 20:40.067
You can't force him to stay,
Detective.

20:40.133 --> 20:42.174
It becomes a custodial issue,
and anything he says...

20:42.245 --> 20:44.033
without a Miranda warning
is inadmissible.

20:44.101 --> 20:45.279
You're tying our hands.

20:45.349 --> 20:47.236
Then even the playing field.

20:47.653 --> 20:49.344
How?
He hates women.

20:49.414 --> 20:51.999
Get on his level,
the nastier the better.

20:52.070 --> 20:54.917
Won't that make him
suspicious? Probably.

20:55.558 --> 20:56.987
But he wants to talk.

20:57.990 --> 21:00.259
He was in charge
when he killed the victim.

21:00.327 --> 21:03.644
But how will anybody know his
power unless he reveals it?

21:16.681 --> 21:17.890
Bad news?

21:21.193 --> 21:23.398
You wouldn't believe it
if I told you.

21:25.322 --> 21:27.842
Stupid, stone-crunching slut.

21:29.098 --> 21:30.244
Who?

21:31.146 --> 21:32.455
My wife.

21:33.578 --> 21:34.920
How long you been married?

21:34.987 --> 21:36.993
Sixteen year sentence.

21:37.067 --> 21:40.645
Sixteen long, dry years.

21:41.547 --> 21:43.784
Any kids?
Too many.

21:44.362 --> 21:46.633
Creditor just called.
I'm in hock up to my ass.

21:46.700 --> 21:50.694
My wife shops, and if I
take away her credit cards...

21:51.692 --> 21:54.506
she don't give me any.

21:59.214 --> 22:00.676
Let me guess...

22:01.325 --> 22:03.715
your oldest child is 16.

22:07.182 --> 22:08.709
How did you know that?

22:11.823 --> 22:13.961
You're a cliché, Detective.

22:15.694 --> 22:17.549
A responsible guy.

22:18.608 --> 22:20.364
Good man
gets caught out there.

22:20.432 --> 22:22.537
Woman is just
looking for a free ride.

22:23.248 --> 22:25.453
Your only refuge is the job.

22:26.288 --> 22:28.176
It's the only
peace you have.

22:28.240 --> 22:30.629
I love my job.
Why wouldn't you?

22:32.784 --> 22:35.753
You get to catch the bad guys
and put them away.

22:38.578 --> 22:40.400
But the best part
is the why...

22:41.969 --> 22:43.628
understanding the motive.

22:44.979 --> 22:47.532
There's usually a reason.
An innocent victim...

22:49.331 --> 22:50.641
very rare.

22:59.571 --> 23:02.540
Do you really
think that's true?

23:02.933 --> 23:06.031
I've been doing this a long
time, Jason. I know it's true.

23:08.373 --> 23:11.156
The women victims,
for the most part...

23:13.238 --> 23:14.962
were asking for it.

23:17.494 --> 23:19.217
They take our manhood.

23:19.607 --> 23:21.647
They suck us dry.
They mess with our heads.

23:21.718 --> 23:24.502
And then they're surprised
when we fight back.

23:31.703 --> 23:34.256
Do you think that Veronica
was asking for it?

23:34.807 --> 23:37.230
Is that her victimology?

23:39.000 --> 23:40.942
You knew her. You tell me.

23:44.826 --> 23:46.386
She was...

23:47.417 --> 23:48.911
She was a bitch.

23:52.313 --> 23:54.037
What did she do to you?

23:56.378 --> 23:57.589
I told you.

23:57.659 --> 23:59.514
No, I know there's more.
I can see.

23:59.579 --> 24:02.427
I see it in your eyes.
She hurt you badly.

24:08.091 --> 24:09.947
What did she do to you,
Jason?

24:15.293 --> 24:16.886
She took my dream.

24:18.141 --> 24:22.069
She wrote a letter to the
Academy saying that I wasn't fit.

24:33.503 --> 24:37.758
She wanted me to meet her out in
front of some department store.

24:38.943 --> 24:42.620
She told me that if I slept
with her, she could fix it.

24:46.079 --> 24:47.771
We made out.

24:47.840 --> 24:49.531
But I couldn't do it.

24:51.521 --> 24:53.855
I like her husband.
He's a nice guy.

24:55.457 --> 24:57.083
Which department store?

24:59.105 --> 25:01.276
Crazy Bob's on Lexington.

25:01.345 --> 25:03.134
They sell electronics.

25:09.570 --> 25:11.426
Mayberry's
only been here two weeks.

25:11.491 --> 25:13.313
And now he's going
into the Police Academy.

25:13.379 --> 25:16.576
Training alone takes a month.
He should've told you that.

25:16.644 --> 25:19.361
He a good employee?
I suppose.

25:19.427 --> 25:21.467
A little Chatty Kathy
about his girlfriend...

25:21.540 --> 25:23.908
but he's usually here on time,
and that's all I care about.

25:23.972 --> 25:25.729
This girlfriend
have a name?

25:26.949 --> 25:30.178
You ask me, the woman in the
photographs doesn't even know he exists.

25:30.244 --> 25:31.586
What do you mean?

25:31.654 --> 25:33.726
Thanks.
I'll show you.

25:36.613 --> 25:39.462
Why no doors?
They got something to hide...

25:39.526 --> 25:42.112
they can leave it at home.
Here it is.

25:46.726 --> 25:48.931
Go get that search warrant,
Counselor.

25:49.223 --> 25:52.093
The perps got photos of
our victim, Veronica Tandy.

25:55.849 --> 25:57.758
Hey, guys,
what have we got so far?

25:57.831 --> 26:00.549
Well, aside from this guy's
cop fixation, not much.

26:00.616 --> 26:01.663
Okay.

26:01.736 --> 26:05.184
So let me guess, no trophies,
no 8-inch serrated Rambo knife?

26:05.258 --> 26:06.851
No. We just got here.

26:14.507 --> 26:16.514
Well, I'll be damned.
Yeah.

26:16.906 --> 26:19.776
Looks like Jason
wears a condom every day.

26:27.436 --> 26:29.891
No one said anything about
a roommate. Whose are these?

26:29.964 --> 26:32.550
Maybe a girlfriend,
or he's a cross-dresser.

26:34.796 --> 26:37.382
Monogram says
they belong to a GM.

26:38.093 --> 26:40.712
Look, dirty laundry...

26:41.037 --> 26:42.695
including women's panties.

26:42.893 --> 26:44.137
Detective.

26:44.205 --> 26:47.523
Where did you find those? On
top of that cabinet right there.

26:47.758 --> 26:51.018
Look. Looks like a bunch of bloody
hatpins with locations attached.

26:51.087 --> 26:53.956
Okay. Make out a list
and call them into Cragen.

26:54.030 --> 26:55.143
Why?

26:55.214 --> 26:58.030
Because our suspect
used these to practice.

26:58.095 --> 27:00.779
Also, I need you to walk
those panties through the lab.

27:00.847 --> 27:02.156
I'm on it.
Rush the DNA.

27:02.223 --> 27:04.525
Up to what level?
Mitochondrial.

27:06.832 --> 27:08.807
Been holding out on me.

27:09.136 --> 27:10.183
No, I'm not.

27:10.256 --> 27:12.263
You've been holding out on me,
and I don't like it.

27:12.336 --> 27:14.955
I don't like being played. Now,
I have treated you like a man.

27:15.025 --> 27:19.280
I have respected you. And you've
been treating me like some bitch.

27:19.633 --> 27:23.115
No. I would never do that.
You have and you still are.

27:23.186 --> 27:24.134
Now...

27:25.074 --> 27:28.752
women should be lied to. They don't
understand men. They never will.

27:31.122 --> 27:33.130
I know you've
been lying to me.

27:33.203 --> 27:35.243
And it's going to
stop right now.

27:35.955 --> 27:38.573
I want to go home.
"I want to go home."

27:40.083 --> 27:42.254
We found the pictures,
you know that?

27:44.212 --> 27:46.155
What pictures?
Sad...

27:46.227 --> 27:48.366
desperate photos
of Veronica Tandy

27:48.437 --> 27:49.681
that you had
taped in your locker.

27:49.748 --> 27:52.270
Now, you told everyone
she was your girlfriend?

27:57.685 --> 28:00.817
She was my girlfriend.
I thought she harassed you...

28:00.885 --> 28:02.292
tried to force you
into her bed.

28:02.358 --> 28:04.780
Now all of a sudden
she's your girlfriend? Huh?

28:07.606 --> 28:10.127
You wouldn't know what to do
with a woman if you paid her.

28:10.199 --> 28:12.753
Now you're insulting me. I
don't have to take this from you.

28:12.823 --> 28:15.540
You do. You expect me to believe
this beautiful woman chose you...

28:15.608 --> 28:18.128
cheated on her husband,
had a passion for you?

28:19.927 --> 28:20.876
What?

28:20.951 --> 28:22.446
What's the matter?
I'm leaving.

28:22.520 --> 28:24.244
Go ahead. I can't stop you.

28:26.104 --> 28:29.105
You walk out, you look guilty.
Everyone is gonna think that you did it.

28:29.176 --> 28:31.152
And your big-time
socialite mom.

28:31.225 --> 28:33.779
Now what do you do think the
press is gonna do with that?

28:33.850 --> 28:36.849
They're gonna hound you. They're
gonna follow you everywhere you go.

28:36.922 --> 28:39.890
Now is that what you want?
Go ahead. Bye-bye.

28:43.994 --> 28:45.205
I loved her.

28:47.674 --> 28:50.163
Ronnie was gonna leave...

28:50.236 --> 28:53.334
that pitiful excuse for a man
to be with me.

28:53.916 --> 28:56.731
But then she couldn't
because she got pregnant.

28:56.796 --> 29:00.309
That baby could be mine.
That baby is dead.

29:01.180 --> 29:04.148
Mother's dead, baby's dead.
You killed them both.

29:04.221 --> 29:07.767
You're just making this up because you
have to blame someone. It wasn't me.

29:07.837 --> 29:10.227
You yoked her!
You raped her!

29:10.302 --> 29:13.499
And when she pleaded for her life
and that of her unborn child...

29:13.566 --> 29:16.915
you stuck your knife into
her back to make her shut up.

29:16.990 --> 29:19.413
That's what really happened,
Jason. Just admit it.

29:19.486 --> 29:21.495
No! I did not kill her!

29:22.751 --> 29:24.278
Yeah, you did.
No.

29:25.151 --> 29:28.284
It was someone else, not me.

29:29.951 --> 29:31.381
I want a lawyer.

29:31.904 --> 29:34.238
Jason, I'm willing to hear
your side of the story.

29:34.305 --> 29:36.760
But you bring a lawyer
into the situation...

29:37.153 --> 29:38.679
it's just gonna
screw it all up.

29:38.754 --> 29:41.120
They don't help it.
They just make it worse.

29:41.185 --> 29:43.902
I'm going home. Fine. You
feel more comfortable there...

29:43.970 --> 29:46.303
I'll finish up at your place.
That's fine. I'll go with you.

29:46.370 --> 29:48.891
Why can't you leave me alone?

29:48.963 --> 29:49.911
Huh?

29:54.114 --> 29:55.425
Jason, we're almost done.

29:55.490 --> 29:57.825
Just answer my questions,
tell me the truth...

29:57.891 --> 29:59.833
and you can leave.

30:07.460 --> 30:08.736
Excuse me.

30:11.268 --> 30:13.276
Do I need
to call the police?

30:13.348 --> 30:14.909
I'm already here.

30:14.981 --> 30:16.891
And what do you want?

30:18.629 --> 30:20.057
Is that your blouse?

30:21.670 --> 30:22.914
Yes.

30:23.270 --> 30:25.442
Yes, it is. Have you
searched Jason's apartment?

30:25.510 --> 30:27.965
Yes, ma'am.
Is he a suspect?

30:28.871 --> 30:30.333
Do you live with him?

30:31.078 --> 30:34.145
My son is a lot of things,
but he's not a murderer.

30:35.399 --> 30:36.610
Is he under arrest?

30:36.680 --> 30:39.264
No. Why do you leave your
clothing at his apartment?

30:39.336 --> 30:40.449
I told you.

30:40.519 --> 30:42.080
Jason doesn't like it here.

30:42.152 --> 30:45.283
So if I want to see him,
I have to go into the city.

30:45.672 --> 30:48.989
We have dinner, sometimes
we go to the theater.

30:49.065 --> 30:51.748
And after that it is too late
for me to drive home...

30:51.817 --> 30:54.207
so sometimes
I spend the night.

30:54.282 --> 30:58.111
All of which
is none of your business.

30:59.465 --> 31:02.051
It's an awfully small apartment
for overnight guests, Mrs. Mayberry.

31:02.123 --> 31:03.399
Where do you sleep?

31:04.586 --> 31:07.337
There was only a Murphy bed,
and I didn't see a cot.

31:07.402 --> 31:08.777
Why not a hotel?

31:09.066 --> 31:11.915
Well, why stay at all?
It's not that long of a drive.

31:12.043 --> 31:13.636
It's over an hour.

31:16.012 --> 31:18.216
What the hell did you
do to your son?

31:19.532 --> 31:22.849
I don't like your question,
and I don't like your tone.

31:23.341 --> 31:24.585
Please leave.

31:28.684 --> 31:30.540
How many attacks?

31:32.173 --> 31:35.469
I've got six pins here with
corresponding complainants...

31:35.535 --> 31:37.029
at locations around the city.

31:37.103 --> 31:39.437
I'll bet there may have been
more that weren't reported.

31:39.502 --> 31:42.470
He may have re-used the pins
as he built the fantasy.

31:42.703 --> 31:43.913
Piquerism.

31:43.982 --> 31:47.147
The murder was piqueristic,
and I just didn't see it.

31:48.527 --> 31:51.593
He derives excitement
from stabbing women's flesh.

31:52.847 --> 31:56.144
Six victims walking in a crowd,
suddenly attacked from behind...

31:56.208 --> 31:59.208
and stuck with hatpins
in the buttocks and back.

31:59.440 --> 32:01.861
And not one
could ID her attacker.

32:03.122 --> 32:04.812
It fits his profile.

32:06.225 --> 32:10.382
What about Norfolk and Houston? You
stuck a woman in the back with a pin...

32:10.577 --> 32:12.488
missed her spine by an inch.

32:12.562 --> 32:13.991
I want to go home.

32:14.482 --> 32:15.530
You can't keep me here.

32:15.603 --> 32:17.741
Don't you want to know how I
know this? Aren't you curious?

32:17.811 --> 32:19.566
No. We've been inside your apartment.

32:19.635 --> 32:21.161
We found the hatpins.

32:23.603 --> 32:25.610
Avenue A and Second Street...

32:25.683 --> 32:27.756
I know you
remember this blonde.

32:27.828 --> 32:31.887
Broad daylight, you snuck up behind
her, and you stuck her pretty good.

32:51.191 --> 32:52.336
Jason...

32:57.431 --> 33:00.050
how long has your mother
been sleeping with you?

33:03.512 --> 33:05.236
What are you talking about?

33:06.360 --> 33:08.914
That's crazy.
Jason, listen to me.

33:10.936 --> 33:13.304
She had no right
to touch you like that.

33:14.009 --> 33:16.016
She had no right to abuse you.

33:18.138 --> 33:19.315
You're crazy.

33:20.089 --> 33:21.844
You know that.
You're all...

33:22.009 --> 33:23.384
You're all crazy.

33:24.314 --> 33:26.103
Hey! Hey!

33:27.290 --> 33:28.949
Is that what happens
to all you people here?

33:29.019 --> 33:31.124
The sex police.
Sex on the brain.

33:31.195 --> 33:33.684
Well, my mother
never touched me like that.

33:33.755 --> 33:36.090
You were six years old
and still sleeping with Mommy.

33:36.155 --> 33:37.782
What'd she say to you,
Jason?

33:37.851 --> 33:39.412
You have nightmares
so you should sleep with her?

33:39.484 --> 33:40.761
Keep the monsters away?

33:40.829 --> 33:41.974
Can we stop?

33:42.044 --> 33:44.564
Can we stop now? And at 10
she'd let you sleep alone.

33:44.637 --> 33:46.808
She'd
come to you at night...

33:46.876 --> 33:49.298
telling you, you were
the man of the house.

33:50.685 --> 33:53.206
Why don't you
just shut the hell up?

33:56.573 --> 33:59.388
She initiated you into
sexual experience in puberty.

34:01.663 --> 34:02.610
Jason?

34:04.191 --> 34:06.047
You were scared
because you knew it was wrong.

34:06.111 --> 34:07.256
You were still a boy,
Jason.

34:07.327 --> 34:09.748
You were confused,
disgusted...

34:11.839 --> 34:13.050
abused.

34:14.815 --> 34:16.571
Jason,
it wasn't your fault.

34:22.208 --> 34:23.157
Yes.

34:27.873 --> 34:28.822
Yes.

34:30.241 --> 34:31.670
Yes, it was.

34:47.938 --> 34:48.889
I'm...

34:50.402 --> 34:52.378
I'm a dirty little boy.

34:54.821 --> 34:57.341
I can't keep my hands
to myself.

35:00.805 --> 35:02.266
You lying boy.

35:04.613 --> 35:07.396
Don't look. Look.

35:08.423 --> 35:10.112
Don't touch. Touch me.

35:13.734 --> 35:15.142
Go away.

35:15.206 --> 35:18.338
No, come here and hold me.

35:18.406 --> 35:20.611
Baby, doesn't that
feel so good?

35:21.991 --> 35:23.846
You're a good little boy.

35:28.841 --> 35:29.789
Shh.

35:46.474 --> 35:49.094
What are the charges?
Right now, murder and rape.

35:49.162 --> 35:52.478
Was he Mirandized? Counselor,
nobody here is stupid.

35:52.779 --> 35:53.794
Jason.

35:54.155 --> 35:55.978
What have you done?

35:56.619 --> 35:59.172
Do you realize
what this will do to me?

36:00.940 --> 36:03.012
What have you
been saying about me?

36:04.460 --> 36:06.664
You lied through your teeth,
didn't you?

36:06.733 --> 36:08.424
You always lie.

36:09.005 --> 36:12.867
You're a filthy, lying
bastard. That's enough, Grace.

36:13.357 --> 36:15.911
Keep your mouth shut. I'll get
you out of here in no time.

36:15.981 --> 36:18.250
People versus
Jason Thaddeus Mayberry.

36:18.317 --> 36:20.227
One count,
murder in the first degree.

36:20.302 --> 36:22.090
One count,
rape in the first degree.

36:22.158 --> 36:24.580
Six counts of assault
in the second.

36:28.335 --> 36:30.571
How do you plead?
Not guilty, Your Honor.

36:30.639 --> 36:33.095
Ms. Cabot?
Remand, Your Honor.

36:33.168 --> 36:36.746
The Mayberry's are an old,
upstanding family in New Jersey.

36:36.815 --> 36:38.987
My client
is not a flight risk.

36:39.056 --> 36:42.406
His mother, Grace Mayberry,
will produce him for trial.

36:42.479 --> 36:44.782
Because of his trust, as
well as his mother's wealth...

36:44.848 --> 36:46.375
he has means
and opportunity to flee.

36:46.449 --> 36:48.456
The defendant is charged
with heinous crimes.

36:48.530 --> 36:51.050
The murder victim was 7
weeks pregnant... Objection!

36:52.881 --> 36:55.085
That was a nice try,
Counselor.

36:55.153 --> 36:56.560
Don't do it again.

36:57.298 --> 36:58.607
My apologies.

36:58.674 --> 37:00.846
Bail is set at $1 million.

37:00.914 --> 37:02.889
Post or enjoy my hospitality.

37:05.010 --> 37:06.800
No deal.
I'm not looking for one.

37:06.867 --> 37:09.616
My client isn't guilty. Your
client belongs in a pine box...

37:09.684 --> 37:11.210
but I will settle
for an 8-by-10 cell

37:11.283 --> 37:12.810
where he can rot
until he dies.

37:12.884 --> 37:14.607
Don't get ahead of yourself,
Ms. Cabot.

37:14.675 --> 37:17.228
I have got his un-coerced
and legal confession.

37:17.300 --> 37:19.667
I have got bloody hatpins
from his piqueristic attacks.

37:19.732 --> 37:21.293
I've got a homicide victim
who was known...

37:21.365 --> 37:22.959
to the defendant
and his motive for killing.

37:23.029 --> 37:25.418
I don't know if that's
overconfidence or hubris.

37:25.493 --> 37:29.170
That was so much fun, I thought
we'd do it again. See you in court.

37:35.767 --> 37:38.516
The hatpins weren't in the
scope of the search warrant.

37:38.582 --> 37:41.453
They were in plain
view, Your Honor. Hardly.

37:41.527 --> 37:43.250
The box was kept
on a high cabinet.

37:43.319 --> 37:46.069
Or will the People try to tell me
that someone in the search team...

37:46.136 --> 37:47.543
was 7 feet tall?

37:47.608 --> 37:48.852
They were
looking for a knife.

37:48.919 --> 37:52.433
And instead they found bloody
hatpins used in piquerist attacks.

37:52.505 --> 37:56.018
Six victims, six hatpins, all
labeled with corresponding locations.

37:56.089 --> 37:58.773
If the police search for a gun and
find a bloody knife with hair...

37:58.841 --> 38:00.401
I'm certainly
not going to throw it out.

38:00.473 --> 38:02.862
Hatpins remain in evidence.
Next item.

38:02.937 --> 38:04.978
Constitutional violation.

38:05.049 --> 38:08.181
My client asked for a lawyer
and was denied access.

38:08.570 --> 38:10.709
The defendant was not
under arrest at the time.

38:10.778 --> 38:12.207
There was no custodial issue.

38:12.282 --> 38:13.625
I submit he was in custody...

38:13.690 --> 38:16.342
from the moment he was asked to
accompany the officers to their precinct.

38:16.410 --> 38:19.378
The suspect was free to go at any time
prior to the discovery of evidence...

38:19.451 --> 38:21.872
in his apartment.
Come on, Counselor.

38:21.947 --> 38:24.796
The police are notorious for
their intimidation tactics.

38:24.860 --> 38:26.715
He asked for a lawyer.
He didn't get one.

38:26.780 --> 38:29.147
Did the suspect
ask for counsel, Ms. Cabot?

38:29.212 --> 38:30.227
Yes.

38:30.301 --> 38:32.244
But then he wanted to
continue without one.

38:32.316 --> 38:35.219
Did he want to continue,
or was he threatened?

38:35.292 --> 38:37.595
Your Honor, I take...
Sorry, Counselor.

38:37.661 --> 38:39.866
Although I'd like to agree
with you concerning custody...

38:39.933 --> 38:43.414
I'm on a slippery slope, and I'd
rather err on the side of caution.

38:43.486 --> 38:45.079
The confession is out.

38:47.359 --> 38:48.821
He wasn't under arrest.

38:48.894 --> 38:51.678
I specifically cautioned you
about the custodial issue.

38:51.743 --> 38:54.874
No, you said that he was to
be free to go at any time.

38:54.943 --> 38:56.852
My detective
persuaded him otherwise.

38:56.928 --> 38:58.553
He did a hell of a job
getting that confession.

38:58.624 --> 39:00.217
Whose side you on?
Mine.

39:00.287 --> 39:03.103
You know the trial closure rate for
sex crimes cases is four percent.

39:03.168 --> 39:04.183
Four percent.

39:04.256 --> 39:06.679
There are a lot of factors
responsible for that but I never...

39:06.752 --> 39:09.208
I did my job, Counselor. Don't
blame me if you didn't do yours.

39:09.281 --> 39:10.710
I stayed in that room
and pushed him to the edge.

39:10.784 --> 39:12.540
You lost him
on a technicality.

39:12.609 --> 39:14.300
All right.
That's enough, both of you.

39:14.368 --> 39:16.824
Do we know where he is? He's
in New Jersey with his mother.

39:16.897 --> 39:18.839
I notified the locals. They
said they'd do their best.

39:18.914 --> 39:20.954
That's reassuring.
So what do we do

39:21.026 --> 39:22.619
to catch this hump
before he strikes again?

39:22.691 --> 39:25.113
Can you reconstruct his
movements after the attacks?

39:25.186 --> 39:26.593
Well,
what are we looking for?

39:26.658 --> 39:28.960
I think he went home to his
mother after each attack.

39:29.026 --> 39:31.231
He felt compelled
to go to the source.

39:31.588 --> 39:34.338
Mother created a loving
husband in her baby son.

39:34.404 --> 39:36.313
It all starts
and ends with her.

39:36.388 --> 39:38.494
You think
the murder weapon's there?

39:38.724 --> 39:40.186
It's a possibility.

39:40.260 --> 39:43.195
It's gotta be somewhere.
He didn't just throw it away.

39:43.269 --> 39:46.205
Well, we can't go on a digging
expedition based on possibility.

39:46.277 --> 39:48.383
He suffers from piquerism,
Counselor.

39:48.453 --> 39:50.842
That knife
represents his penis.

39:51.461 --> 39:53.185
It is not disposable.

39:58.502 --> 40:01.186
I've shown you all my cards,
Malcolm. What's it going to be?

40:01.255 --> 40:04.222
No judge is going to sign a warrant
based on what you've got, Alex.

40:04.294 --> 40:07.939
Credit card receipts from area stores
and witness statements which put him...

40:08.008 --> 40:09.982
in his mother's house
after each attack.

40:10.055 --> 40:11.484
What more could you
possibly need?

40:11.560 --> 40:15.303
That isn't enough to prove that he stashed
a murder weapon in his mother's home.

40:15.367 --> 40:18.663
What has to happen before you get off
your collective asses and do your jobs?

40:18.729 --> 40:21.150
Look, I know you're upset, Detective,
but the law doesn't allow...

40:21.224 --> 40:23.079
Just tell me
what you need?

40:23.145 --> 40:24.487
You need a New Jersey victim
to do something?

40:24.554 --> 40:26.179
He admitted to everything.
Detective!

40:26.249 --> 40:29.348
We got his confession on tape.
We just couldn't hold him.

40:29.417 --> 40:32.320
You don't make a lot of
friends, do you? Yeah, well...

40:33.002 --> 40:33.950
Look...

40:34.634 --> 40:37.056
Grace Mayberry created
the man who did this.

40:37.131 --> 40:39.401
By warping his mind she
destroyed his female victims...

40:39.466 --> 40:41.572
as if she'd wielded the knife herself.

40:43.691 --> 40:45.317
We got one long shot.

40:46.028 --> 40:48.931
Judge Chandler's a real friend
of the fraternal order.

40:49.004 --> 40:50.663
He might let us squeak by.

41:02.670 --> 41:03.617
Hello?

41:09.198 --> 41:10.692
Mrs. Mayberry?

41:44.786 --> 41:46.128
I told her...

41:51.443 --> 41:53.614
I'm not a little boy anymore.

41:54.305 --> 42:00.483
