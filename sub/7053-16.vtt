WEBVTT

00:02.550 --> 00:04.110
Previously on Fringe...

00:04.260 --> 00:05.770
You nearly died when you were a boy.

00:06.380 --> 00:09.160
I became consumed with saving you.

00:09.320 --> 00:10.610
Walter, I don't remember any of that.

00:13.120 --> 00:14.710
There is more than one of everything.

00:15.620 --> 00:16.870
I have said too much.

00:17.030 --> 00:18.820
I am not supposed to get involved.

00:19.820 --> 00:21.130
What did you people do to us?

00:21.270 --> 00:22.100
Of the children

00:22.300 --> 00:23.700
that William Bell and I experimented on,

00:23.860 --> 00:27.110
you were the first to identify
things from the other side.

00:27.250 --> 00:28.710
Was it me who described it as a glimmer?

00:30.810 --> 00:33.300
I've never met anyone who
can do the things that you do.

00:35.820 --> 00:36.960
I'll go get my coat.

00:38.370 --> 00:39.710
Please don't tell him.

00:54.370 --> 00:55.380
Our success thus far

00:55.590 --> 00:58.610
should serve as an example
of our ability to achieve

00:58.890 --> 01:00.810
that which most can't even imagine.

01:01.390 --> 01:04.360
What you must understand
is that, as scientists,

01:04.560 --> 01:06.890
we must embrace every possibility.

01:07.220 --> 01:09.600
No limitations. No boundaries.

01:10.250 --> 01:11.470
There is no reason for them.

01:12.230 --> 01:13.070
Gentlemen...

01:14.710 --> 01:16.580
I would like you to take a look at this.

01:18.400 --> 01:19.490
It's a mobile telephone.

01:20.290 --> 01:22.510
It can be made much
smaller, I assure you.

01:22.680 --> 01:23.600
Does this work?

01:23.960 --> 01:25.550
Not here, not yet.

01:25.860 --> 01:29.190
This phone is digital, not analog.

01:29.720 --> 01:31.860
It'll take us 30 years
to get up to speed.

01:32.580 --> 01:34.370
I didn't invent it. I wish I had.

01:34.500 --> 01:35.900
Dr. Bishop, we were under the impression

01:36.040 --> 01:37.260
Dr. Bell would be here this evening.

01:37.470 --> 01:38.800
I'm afraid that's not possible.

01:39.310 --> 01:40.840
Dr. Bell is in Europe.

01:40.950 --> 01:42.060
But I am here,

01:42.310 --> 01:44.090
so I can answer any
questions you may have.

01:45.050 --> 01:45.940
Dr. Bishop,

01:46.050 --> 01:47.200
is this Russian technology?

01:47.380 --> 01:50.090
It is not. It is quite American.

01:50.240 --> 01:51.130
But...

01:52.750 --> 01:55.390
It is technology from another universe.

01:55.820 --> 01:56.600
An alternate universe

01:56.790 --> 01:57.770
just like ours...

01:58.970 --> 02:00.950
But more advanced in some area.

02:01.110 --> 02:02.280
Are you suggesting you somehow

02:02.450 --> 02:04.100
visited this alternate universe

02:04.270 --> 02:06.130
and acquired this advanced technology?

02:06.290 --> 02:10.360
No, it is exactly
impossible to go there.

02:10.500 --> 02:12.150
Then how did you come to possess this?

02:13.580 --> 02:14.400
I copied it.

02:16.500 --> 02:18.400
For the last several years,

02:18.470 --> 02:20.740
William and I have been
conducting various experiments

02:20.810 --> 02:24.510
regarding this other universe.

02:24.580 --> 02:26.550
So based on our findings,

02:26.610 --> 02:28.850
we developed a window of sorts,

02:28.920 --> 02:32.180
a way of looking into
this neighboring world.

02:32.250 --> 02:35.320
And that is why we
are asking for funding.

02:35.390 --> 02:37.760
This is my colleague, Dr. Carla Warren.

02:37.820 --> 02:38.890
Hello, sirs.

02:38.960 --> 02:40.660
This window works

02:40.730 --> 02:44.560
by capturing errant photons

02:44.630 --> 02:46.770
from the universe beside ours.

02:46.830 --> 02:49.940
The window essentially
stretches the membrane

02:50.000 --> 02:51.600
between our worlds

02:51.670 --> 02:54.170
and allows us...

02:54.240 --> 02:56.410
to see their image from our side.

02:56.480 --> 02:58.910
You're gonna make some sort
of alternate Manhattan appear?

02:58.980 --> 03:01.410
It's already there, General Hames.

03:01.480 --> 03:02.710
Dr. Warren.

03:02.780 --> 03:03.950
At all times,

03:04.020 --> 03:06.350
right in front of our eyes.

03:06.420 --> 03:08.750
We just can't see it.

03:13.190 --> 03:15.860
I'm sure you know

03:15.930 --> 03:18.000
that the original purpose

03:18.060 --> 03:19.900
for the so-called observation deck

03:19.970 --> 03:21.870
of The Empire State Building

03:21.940 --> 03:24.940
was to be a docking station...

03:24.975 --> 03:26.940
for zeppers of course.

03:32.010 --> 03:34.840
Gentlemen,

03:34.910 --> 03:38.680
you are looking through a window...

03:38.750 --> 03:40.920
into another world.

04:29.200 --> 04:31.800
Walter, what are you doing here?

04:31.870 --> 04:34.470
You left me no choice.

04:34.540 --> 04:36.910
You wouldn't answer your telephone,

04:36.970 --> 04:40.280
return my messages.

04:40.340 --> 04:43.910
I tried to communicate.

04:43.980 --> 04:46.510
I need time, okay?

04:46.580 --> 04:49.050
I don't even know...

04:49.120 --> 04:50.990
how to begin to work this out.

04:51.050 --> 04:54.290
I think I do.

04:54.360 --> 04:56.790
Please, Olivia,

04:56.860 --> 05:01.030
I need to explain.

05:01.100 --> 05:03.330
And if you wouldn't mind,

05:03.400 --> 05:06.600
I could use a sip of something, myself.

05:11.570 --> 05:14.640
Have you told Agent Broyles?

05:14.710 --> 05:17.650
No.

05:17.710 --> 05:19.310
But to be honest,

05:19.380 --> 05:21.420
that doesn't mean that I won't.

05:23.620 --> 05:26.390
I always knew that one day
I'd have to pay the price

05:26.460 --> 05:29.160
for my deception.

05:29.230 --> 05:33.400
Well, we're not really sure
what the cost is yet, are we?

05:35.970 --> 05:39.000
No, I suppose not.

05:45.880 --> 05:49.480
I invented this after
William and I learned

05:49.550 --> 05:51.710
that we had doubles on the other side.

05:51.780 --> 05:55.650
Or maybe it was before.
I can't remember.

05:55.720 --> 05:59.220
It's a window to the other universe.

05:59.290 --> 06:02.390
I was a different man then.

06:02.460 --> 06:03.990
I was going to change the world.

06:04.060 --> 06:08.460
But you see, after Peter became sick,

06:08.530 --> 06:11.330
none of that seemed to matter anymore.

06:11.400 --> 06:15.770
The illness was genetic.

06:15.840 --> 06:17.270
Savage.

06:17.340 --> 06:21.080
Wasting. I tried everything.

06:21.140 --> 06:23.750
There was simply no hope.

06:23.810 --> 06:27.820
At least... not on this side.

06:27.880 --> 06:30.490
But over there...

06:30.550 --> 06:33.500
They're more technologically advanced.

06:33.570 --> 06:37.400
If the alternate Peter
was also sick over there,

06:37.470 --> 06:39.040
then wouldn't his father

06:39.110 --> 06:41.640
be equally motivated to find a cure?

06:44.180 --> 06:47.050
He was.

06:49.320 --> 06:51.720
God help me...

06:51.780 --> 06:55.250
He was.

07:05.360 --> 07:07.700
Any progress?

07:07.770 --> 07:11.140
He's synthesizing a new compound now.

07:22.210 --> 07:24.150
He's using cobalt

07:24.220 --> 07:26.820
and magnesium.

07:26.890 --> 07:29.320
Any idea yet how he's selecting
the filtering compounds?

07:29.390 --> 07:30.920
Random, I think.

07:30.990 --> 07:33.530
Chance, fate, luck of the draw.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.900
I've given him a name, Carla.

07:38.970 --> 07:42.100
- Hmm?
- Walternate.

07:42.170 --> 07:45.240
This is it. This should be the reaction.

07:54.450 --> 07:56.250
No cure.

08:09.200 --> 08:13.030
Perhaps with a higher
iodine purification.

08:25.310 --> 08:26.880
- Walter Bishop.
- Walter?

08:26.940 --> 08:28.950
Elizabeth.

08:29.010 --> 08:30.980
- Is he...
- Yeah, no, he's... he's fine.

08:31.050 --> 08:33.780
He's... he's all right right now.

08:33.850 --> 08:35.320
But, um...

08:35.390 --> 08:36.490
What?

08:36.549 --> 08:40.520
I think you should
come home now, Walter.

08:40.590 --> 08:43.490
I think it's time you came home.

08:43.559 --> 08:48.230
Okay.

08:55.810 --> 08:58.870
He looks worse.

08:59.510 --> 09:00.870
Keeps asking for you.

09:02.210 --> 09:04.610
It's not like before.

09:04.680 --> 09:07.250
What is it like?

09:07.320 --> 09:08.820
It's different.

09:08.890 --> 09:11.790
He keeps saying he wants to talk to you.

09:11.860 --> 09:15.260
He says he's worried
he won't be able to.

09:25.170 --> 09:31.370
I just can't bear it
when you're not here.

09:35.810 --> 09:37.980
You know what I'm doing.

09:38.050 --> 09:41.180
You know where I am 24 hours a day,

09:41.290 --> 09:43.690
7 days a week.

09:43.750 --> 09:44.890
Yes.

09:44.960 --> 09:48.190
I won't give up, Elizabeth.

09:48.260 --> 09:49.860
I can do this.

09:54.830 --> 09:58.000
I need you not to doubt me.

10:05.890 --> 10:09.460
You're supposed to get
some rest, great son.

10:11.400 --> 10:12.630
- Dad?
- Mm?

10:12.700 --> 10:15.970
I've almost got it.

10:19.140 --> 10:21.640
Ooh. Let me show you.

10:21.710 --> 10:23.810
Now...

10:23.880 --> 10:25.240
Slowly...

10:25.310 --> 10:30.180
Watch... one finger at a time.

10:30.250 --> 10:31.620
You show me.

10:42.090 --> 10:44.030
Very good.

10:44.100 --> 10:47.230
I want you to have it,

10:47.300 --> 10:49.370
my lucky silver dollar,

10:49.440 --> 10:51.770
if I die.

10:51.840 --> 10:54.870
Peter...

10:54.940 --> 10:57.180
It's okay.

10:57.240 --> 10:59.340
I'm not scared.

11:02.920 --> 11:05.420
Nothing's going to happen to you.

11:05.480 --> 11:07.050
I promise.

11:07.120 --> 11:10.590
You're going to be just fine.

11:10.660 --> 11:15.590
Okay? Now get some rest.

11:15.660 --> 11:19.030
Okay.

11:19.100 --> 11:22.370
Will you wake me for dinner?

11:22.440 --> 11:25.370
I don't wanna miss it.

11:27.440 --> 11:30.480
You're not gonna miss anything.

13:29.660 --> 13:31.990
You know how much
William wanted to be here.

13:32.800 --> 13:34.140
But with the meetings in Berlin...

13:34.540 --> 13:36.560
I don't need to tell you
how important they are.

13:37.110 --> 13:38.050
For both of you.

13:39.850 --> 13:41.410
He wanted me to make sure that you know

13:41.630 --> 13:42.900
how terrible he feels.

13:44.550 --> 13:45.210
Yes.

13:46.840 --> 13:47.770
I understand.

13:49.220 --> 13:50.330
I'm glad you came.

14:00.070 --> 14:03.540
We didn't give him a good life.

14:03.600 --> 14:06.010
We didn't. He... he...

14:06.070 --> 14:08.170
He practically never
got out of the house.

14:08.240 --> 14:10.280
He was always too sick.

14:10.340 --> 14:12.460
He didn't go to a proper school.

14:12.530 --> 14:14.230
He didn't have any proper friends.

14:14.300 --> 14:18.130
He... he had no family but us.

14:18.200 --> 14:20.930
We kept him so well,

14:21.000 --> 14:24.040
we never let anyone
else get to know him.

14:24.100 --> 14:27.470
We did the best we could.

14:27.540 --> 14:30.740
We dealt with what we were given.

14:34.310 --> 14:37.850
He knew he was loved.

14:45.940 --> 14:49.140
Didn't he?

15:20.070 --> 15:22.670
Walter, what's wrong?

15:25.780 --> 15:28.810
You're cold. Have you been outside?

15:32.750 --> 15:35.050
Come with me.

15:46.860 --> 15:49.270
Walter, what is this?

16:05.220 --> 16:08.790
How's this possible?

16:15.830 --> 16:17.960
How are you doing this?

16:18.030 --> 16:20.530
What I've been working on, Elizabeth,

16:20.600 --> 16:22.870
it's a window to another universe.

16:22.930 --> 16:26.470
Like ours, but different.

16:36.510 --> 16:39.550
Please.

16:39.620 --> 16:40.920
Please turn it back on again.

16:40.990 --> 16:43.320
Please turn it on. I
want to see him again!

16:43.390 --> 16:45.590
Elizabeth, I am telling you this

16:45.660 --> 16:46.820
because I want you to know

16:46.890 --> 16:49.360
that somewhere Peter will grow up,

16:49.430 --> 16:51.160
somewhere he will lead a proper life,

16:51.230 --> 16:54.100
somewhere he will be
happy, but just not here.

16:54.170 --> 16:57.470
And we must take comfort in this.

16:57.540 --> 17:02.370
And we must begin to move on.

18:01.840 --> 18:04.140
The compounds you're
using for the cure...

18:04.200 --> 18:08.370
not random at all.

18:08.440 --> 18:12.480
You are very... very smart.

18:33.470 --> 18:34.470
Yes!

18:34.530 --> 18:36.700
You did it!

18:36.770 --> 18:39.540
By god, you did it!

19:04.130 --> 19:05.760
No.

19:05.830 --> 19:07.430
No, no, you...

19:07.500 --> 19:09.270
You had it, the cure.

19:09.340 --> 19:12.640
All you have to do is
stabilize the compound,

19:12.710 --> 19:15.370
and you can save him.

19:17.780 --> 19:20.110
You can save him.

19:40.460 --> 19:42.380
Their theories are fascinating.

19:43.250 --> 19:44.980
They are not theories.

19:45.610 --> 19:47.800
They are entertainment.

19:51.490 --> 19:52.580
I have made...

19:53.390 --> 19:54.530
a mistake.

19:55.220 --> 19:56.440
So I've heard.

19:56.900 --> 19:58.660
What were you doing in the lab?

19:59.960 --> 20:02.250
Dr. Bishop was on the
verge of developing

20:02.460 --> 20:03.650
a cure for the boy.

20:04.670 --> 20:08.930
It was an important
moment he discovered me.

20:10.500 --> 20:13.670
There was no other way
to witness the moment.

20:13.730 --> 20:16.230
You have changed the future.

20:16.300 --> 20:19.100
You have created a new
set of probabilities.

20:19.170 --> 20:22.610
But you must agree

20:22.680 --> 20:25.140
the moment was significant.

20:25.210 --> 20:28.150
The boy is significant.

20:28.210 --> 20:33.220
You need to take action
to restore balance.

20:33.290 --> 20:35.020
How?

20:37.560 --> 20:41.160
You will have an opportunity

20:41.230 --> 20:42.560
to fix this.

20:58.400 --> 21:00.130
Walter?

21:00.200 --> 21:02.230
Dr. Warren.

21:02.300 --> 21:03.840
Have you been here all night?

21:03.900 --> 21:05.710
I've been working.

21:05.770 --> 21:07.470
Working on what?

21:07.540 --> 21:09.710
- This.
- What is this?

21:09.780 --> 21:12.980
Walternate found a cure.
He found a cure for Peter.

21:13.050 --> 21:14.950
And... and it works, Carla.

21:15.020 --> 21:17.050
It's not too late. I can save him.

21:17.120 --> 21:20.090
Walter, Peter is dead.

21:22.760 --> 21:24.720
I know. Of course I know that!

21:24.790 --> 21:26.660
I'm not talking about my Peter.

21:26.730 --> 21:28.990
I'm talking about the other Peter,

21:29.060 --> 21:31.200
The one on the other side.

21:31.260 --> 21:33.030
He missed it. The other Walter.

21:33.100 --> 21:34.730
He... he missed it and, you know...

21:34.800 --> 21:36.570
It was right there in front of him,

21:36.640 --> 21:38.000
And... and he didn't see it.

21:38.070 --> 21:41.040
- He was distracted by the man.
- What man?

21:41.110 --> 21:43.040
The man in the lab. He was distracted.

21:43.110 --> 21:44.880
And... and when he returned,

21:44.950 --> 21:49.010
the positive result had
failed, and so he moved on.

21:49.080 --> 21:50.450
Maybe he'll realize what he missed,

21:50.520 --> 21:51.620
and he'll go back.

21:51.690 --> 21:54.220
Carla, he is just... like... me.

21:54.290 --> 21:56.120
I wouldn't look back,
and neither will he.

21:56.190 --> 21:58.120
He didn't see the compound...

21:58.190 --> 22:00.190
But I did.

22:00.260 --> 22:02.190
And I've reproduced it.

22:02.260 --> 22:05.730
It just needed... Minor modification.

22:05.800 --> 22:08.170
And without this, Peter will die.

22:09.700 --> 22:12.070
He'll die all over again.

22:12.140 --> 22:15.410
Which is why I have to go over there.

22:15.480 --> 22:17.280
What?

22:17.340 --> 22:20.710
The casimir effect should produce

22:20.780 --> 22:23.580
a thinner, more porous
region of space-time.

22:23.650 --> 22:26.420
I only need to affect
the area for long enough

22:26.490 --> 22:29.820
to cross over to the other
side with a vial of the cure.

22:29.890 --> 22:31.390
And... and then, of course,

22:31.460 --> 22:33.460
recreate the effect to cross back again.

22:33.530 --> 22:36.130
Walter, you're trying
to create a wormhole

22:36.200 --> 22:37.460
into another universe?

22:37.530 --> 22:39.670
Yes!

22:39.730 --> 22:41.400
I think I just said that.

22:41.470 --> 22:44.100
Where's my map?

22:44.170 --> 22:46.440
When I looked into his
room on the other side,

22:46.510 --> 22:49.810
I saw that his mother had
already packed his suitcase

22:49.880 --> 22:51.480
for our lake house,

22:51.550 --> 22:56.350
just like we do every year at this time.

22:56.420 --> 22:58.780
That's where we need to
find a location to set up.

22:58.850 --> 23:01.920
Walter, I'm sorry, but you can't.

23:01.990 --> 23:03.760
Yes.

23:03.820 --> 23:06.130
Yes, I think I can.

23:06.190 --> 23:08.630
No, Walter, I mean you can't.

23:08.700 --> 23:10.800
Shattering the wall between universes

23:10.860 --> 23:13.000
would rupture the fundamental
constants of nature.

23:13.070 --> 23:14.430
It's a theory. We don't
know that to be true.

23:14.500 --> 23:15.670
It's a good theory.

23:15.740 --> 23:17.270
It is why we have been
lying to the military,

23:17.340 --> 23:19.410
telling them it's impossible.

23:19.470 --> 23:22.310
Walter, there has to
be a line somewhere.

23:22.380 --> 23:26.580
There has to be a line we can't cross.

23:29.580 --> 23:33.490
I always considered you as
a scientist, Dr. Warren...

23:33.550 --> 23:38.790
Despite your personal needs
for religious claptrap.

23:38.860 --> 23:40.760
I see I was wrong.

23:42.760 --> 23:44.430
"I am become death,

23:44.500 --> 23:46.300
destroyer of worlds. "

23:46.370 --> 23:48.500
Don't you quote Oppenheimer to me.

23:48.570 --> 23:49.840
Knowledge cannot be
pursued without morality.

23:49.900 --> 23:51.940
You sound like a pious
sanctimonious southern preacher!

23:52.010 --> 23:53.240
I may go to church every sunday, Walter,

23:53.310 --> 23:55.370
but I also have three degrees
in theoretical physics,

23:55.440 --> 23:57.880
And I am telling you you cannot do this.

23:57.940 --> 24:00.110
We both know the amount
of energy required

24:00.180 --> 24:02.980
to create a portal will
forever ruin both universes.

24:03.050 --> 24:07.850
For the sake of one life,
you will destroy the world.

24:07.920 --> 24:11.360
Some things are not ours to tamper with.

24:11.420 --> 24:14.060
Some things are god's.

24:14.130 --> 24:17.800
My son is dying, Dr. Warren.

24:17.860 --> 24:20.900
I will not allow that to happen again.

24:22.870 --> 24:25.340
There's only room for
one god in this lab,

24:25.410 --> 24:27.870
and it's not yours.

24:29.540 --> 24:32.210
The lake. It's perfect.

24:32.280 --> 24:35.310
The water will absorb the excess energy.

24:35.380 --> 24:36.920
And I won't be needing your assistance

24:36.980 --> 24:38.350
any further today, Dr. Warren.

24:38.420 --> 24:40.590
- Walter...
- That will be all.

24:48.330 --> 24:49.960
Walter's always been like that.

24:50.030 --> 24:51.930
He often goes off on flights of fancy.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.900
But even if he was serious,

24:53.970 --> 24:55.570
The design itself is decades beyond

24:55.640 --> 24:56.940
anything we could imagine.

24:57.000 --> 24:58.670
No. You don't understand.

24:58.740 --> 25:00.910
He already has the design.

25:00.970 --> 25:03.610
He's building it.

25:03.680 --> 25:05.680
Oh.

25:10.080 --> 25:13.120
Yes. Dr. Bell's room, please.

25:55.800 --> 25:59.000
Here... Here we do.

26:43.980 --> 26:45.810
See you've changed your mind, Carla.

26:47.070 --> 26:47.790
Good.

26:49.680 --> 26:50.870
I'm sorry, Walter.

26:53.390 --> 26:54.980
You disappoint me, Dr. Warren.

26:56.770 --> 26:57.580
Go home, Nina.

26:57.740 --> 26:58.940
There's work to be done here.

27:00.140 --> 27:01.290
Walter, don't do this.

27:01.520 --> 27:03.520
Oh, I'll be there and
back before you know it.

27:03.670 --> 27:04.500
That's not the point.

27:04.850 --> 27:06.770
We both know that there's
more to it than that.

27:06.910 --> 27:08.990
Don't mean to say
that creating a doorway

27:09.160 --> 27:10.980
between universes is trivial.

27:11.520 --> 27:12.900
I'm simply suggesting that...

27:13.030 --> 27:13.770
Now if William were here...

27:13.900 --> 27:15.050
William were here?

27:16.290 --> 27:17.690
He'd be applauding.

27:17.760 --> 27:19.200
Well, that's not true.

27:19.260 --> 27:21.030
No? Then why isn't he here?

27:21.100 --> 27:23.200
I... the funding, his schedule.

27:23.270 --> 27:24.600
Oh, he's in Europe chasing funding?

27:24.670 --> 27:26.270
Too busy to come and stop me

27:26.340 --> 27:27.970
from destroying the universe?

27:28.040 --> 27:30.540
How many times have you rang him today?

27:30.610 --> 27:32.180
Once? 20?

27:32.240 --> 27:34.280
How many times has
he returned your call?

27:36.180 --> 27:37.650
You know how many times that William

27:37.720 --> 27:40.250
has encouraged me to
take this very risk?

27:40.320 --> 27:44.150
To expedite our espionage program?

27:44.220 --> 27:48.660
"Why simply take a peek into
the other universe, Walter,

27:48.730 --> 27:50.330
when you can go there?"

27:50.390 --> 27:51.690
So up till now,

27:51.760 --> 27:53.130
he couldn't make me find a way

27:53.200 --> 27:54.530
to try to get there

27:54.600 --> 27:56.130
until I had to find a way.

27:56.200 --> 27:57.570
No, I don't believe that.

27:57.640 --> 27:59.270
No, no, you wouldn't,

27:59.340 --> 28:01.340
because you don't understand him.

28:01.410 --> 28:03.970
Like everyone else, you're blinded

28:04.040 --> 28:05.940
by the charming manner,

28:06.010 --> 28:08.140
the air of intelligence,

28:08.210 --> 28:09.610
the whole damn show.

28:09.680 --> 28:11.820
All William Bell ever cared about

28:11.880 --> 28:13.620
was finding a way to increase the power

28:13.680 --> 28:16.690
and the wealth and the
legend of William Bell.

28:20.220 --> 28:23.060
Walter, regardless
of what William wants,

28:23.130 --> 28:24.790
or who he is,

28:24.860 --> 28:27.330
I know why you're doing this.

28:27.400 --> 28:29.800
I understand.

28:29.870 --> 28:32.700
You know how much Peter meant to me,

28:32.770 --> 28:35.440
and how difficult it will be

28:35.510 --> 28:40.110
for me to admit that he's gone.

28:40.180 --> 28:42.810
But... this.

28:42.880 --> 28:45.650
This isn't the answer.

28:50.990 --> 28:52.390
No.

28:52.460 --> 28:54.720
I won't let him die again.

29:04.240 --> 29:06.370
No! Walter! I won't let you do it!

29:09.610 --> 29:12.540
Walter! Oh!

29:22.220 --> 29:24.050
Nina!

29:27.690 --> 29:28.990
Help me!

29:42.690 --> 29:43.230
Oh, no.

29:45.790 --> 29:46.430
Oh, no.

30:11.530 --> 30:12.500
Hey.

30:12.990 --> 30:14.540
You're supposed to
be getting some rest.

30:15.030 --> 30:17.790
Look. I've almost got it.

30:18.360 --> 30:19.570
Okay, let's take a look.

30:27.110 --> 30:28.170
Here, let's see, okay.

30:29.090 --> 30:30.140
It's like this.

30:31.060 --> 30:32.230
Okay, slowly.

30:33.120 --> 30:34.580
One finger at a time.

30:36.310 --> 30:37.130
Okay?

30:39.350 --> 30:40.890
Slowly.

30:42.960 --> 30:44.090
Two...

30:45.190 --> 30:46.190
Three.

30:49.530 --> 30:51.230
Good job.

30:51.300 --> 30:52.530
Okay.

30:52.600 --> 30:53.770
All right, love.

30:53.830 --> 30:55.370
Now sleep, okay?

30:57.440 --> 31:00.670
Good night, sweetheart.

31:00.740 --> 31:01.740
Mom?

31:01.810 --> 31:03.010
Mm-hmm?

31:03.080 --> 31:04.840
I want you to have it.

31:04.910 --> 31:06.780
What, darling?

31:06.850 --> 31:10.380
My lucky silver dollar.

31:10.450 --> 31:11.950
Okay.

31:12.020 --> 31:15.420
I want you to have it

31:15.490 --> 31:16.960
if I die.

31:21.230 --> 31:22.760
Sweetheart, well...

31:22.830 --> 31:24.100
It's okay.

31:25.530 --> 31:27.300
I'm not scared.

31:28.800 --> 31:30.400
Listen.

31:30.470 --> 31:32.410
Nothing is going to happen to you.

31:33.870 --> 31:35.680
I promise.

31:35.740 --> 31:37.880
You're gonna be fine.

31:37.950 --> 31:40.250
You just need to get
some rest now, okay?

31:41.380 --> 31:42.650
Okay.

31:43.680 --> 31:46.850
All right.

31:46.920 --> 31:48.290
Okay, my love.

32:17.250 --> 32:18.450
Dad?

32:18.510 --> 32:20.580
Hello, son.

32:30.180 --> 32:31.650
Dad?

32:31.720 --> 32:34.790
Are you all right?

32:39.740 --> 32:41.280
Yes.

32:41.340 --> 32:44.480
Baby, who you talking to?

32:44.550 --> 32:46.080
Walter?

32:46.150 --> 32:47.780
I... what are you doing here?

32:47.850 --> 32:49.650
I thought you were
working late at Cambridge.

32:49.720 --> 32:51.020
I, uh...

32:51.090 --> 32:52.650
Walter, what are you wearing?

32:52.720 --> 32:54.660
Where did you get that coat?

32:57.460 --> 32:58.790
I think I found a cure.

32:58.860 --> 33:01.260
What?

33:01.330 --> 33:03.030
I think I found it,

33:03.100 --> 33:04.600
a cure for him.

33:04.670 --> 33:06.650
Are you certain?

33:06.720 --> 33:08.920
Yes, I believe so.

33:08.990 --> 33:11.560
I'll need to take him back
to Cambridge to the lab.

33:11.630 --> 33:13.330
Now.

33:13.400 --> 33:14.600
Yes. Yeah, of course.

33:14.660 --> 33:17.370
Right, Peter, darling, get up.

33:17.430 --> 33:18.470
I'm going to get you dressed.

33:18.540 --> 33:21.570
Darling, let's get you out of this.

33:21.640 --> 33:22.970
Okay. Good boy.

33:25.680 --> 33:26.610
Okay, let's...

33:26.680 --> 33:27.880
There's a good chap.

33:30.550 --> 33:31.550
All right.

33:33.080 --> 33:35.050
Darling, we just have
to go to daddy's work.

33:35.120 --> 33:36.820
- Elizabeth?
- Mm... hmm?

33:36.890 --> 33:38.390
May I have a word, please?

33:38.460 --> 33:39.790
Yeah, of course.

33:39.860 --> 33:41.460
Put the gloves on.

33:44.530 --> 33:46.060
What is it?

33:47.760 --> 33:49.630
I think you should stay here.

33:49.700 --> 33:51.200
What?

33:51.270 --> 33:53.470
The cure, there's still
testing to be done,

33:53.540 --> 33:57.010
and it could take all night
to find the correct dosage.

33:57.070 --> 33:58.540
Well, I can pack a bag.

33:58.610 --> 34:00.580
No.

34:00.640 --> 34:04.080
No, you haven't slept in weeks.

34:04.150 --> 34:08.120
If it works, there could
be many days and weeks

34:08.179 --> 34:09.219
of recuperation.

34:09.290 --> 34:10.489
Peter will need you.

34:10.550 --> 34:11.520
He'll need you to be strong.

34:11.590 --> 34:12.520
- Walter...
- No.

34:12.590 --> 34:13.690
I'm fine.

34:13.760 --> 34:15.719
Please, Liz.

34:15.790 --> 34:18.130
I need you not to doubt me.

34:22.870 --> 34:24.270
Okay.

34:25.500 --> 34:26.900
Okay.

34:36.610 --> 34:38.550
Oh, god, he's burning up.

34:38.620 --> 34:39.650
We should leave.

34:45.090 --> 34:46.960
You take this for luck.

34:48.590 --> 34:49.989
I love you very much.

34:50.060 --> 34:53.960
I love you too, Mom.

34:56.670 --> 34:59.300
I'm going to be waiting
for you right here.

34:59.370 --> 35:00.570
Okay?

35:00.640 --> 35:02.640
Okay, go on.

35:07.410 --> 35:08.780
Gloves.

35:12.480 --> 35:14.680
Bring him back to me.

35:16.750 --> 35:18.220
I promise.

35:33.770 --> 35:36.270
Are you warm enough?

35:36.340 --> 35:37.775
I'm cold.

35:37.810 --> 35:39.210
Me too.

35:39.280 --> 35:41.080
Just a little farther.

35:44.050 --> 35:45.880
Where are we going?

35:45.950 --> 35:47.950
Why aren't we taking the car?

35:49.490 --> 35:51.590
We can't get where we're going in a car.

35:54.620 --> 35:56.630
You're not my father,

35:56.690 --> 35:57.830
are you?

36:04.100 --> 36:06.000
Of course I am.

36:06.070 --> 36:08.340
Who else would I be?

36:08.400 --> 36:10.910
I'm going to make you all better.

36:24.190 --> 36:26.860
Hold on tight, son.

36:38.800 --> 36:40.740
We did it.

37:51.180 --> 37:52.210
Is he okay?

37:55.640 --> 37:56.690
Who are you?

37:58.120 --> 37:59.460
You're the man I saw...

38:00.490 --> 38:01.310
in the lab...

38:01.860 --> 38:03.040
on the other side.

38:08.670 --> 38:11.240
Your friend and the one who was injured,

38:11.300 --> 38:13.910
they left to seek medical attention.

38:18.380 --> 38:20.250
He won't live much longer.

38:20.310 --> 38:23.280
You must fix him.

38:24.550 --> 38:27.820
Your lab is six miles from here.

38:27.890 --> 38:29.290
Can you drive?

38:29.360 --> 38:31.520
Think so.

38:40.110 --> 38:42.650
Why...

38:42.710 --> 38:44.110
Why did you save us?

38:48.120 --> 38:50.350
The boy is important.

38:51.560 --> 38:53.220
He has to live.

39:30.770 --> 39:33.100
I just got off with the hospital.

39:33.170 --> 39:35.870
Dr. Bell called in a
team of specialists.

39:35.940 --> 39:38.770
He has some thoughts on Nina's arm.

39:38.840 --> 39:41.280
Thank you for coming
in to help with Peter,

39:41.340 --> 39:42.940
after all that happened.

39:43.010 --> 39:44.710
Of course, Walter.

39:44.780 --> 39:46.280
He looks better.

39:46.350 --> 39:47.720
Yes.

39:47.780 --> 39:50.850
He's getting his color back.

39:50.920 --> 39:52.720
Seems to be working.

39:52.790 --> 39:54.960
You're going to return him.

39:55.020 --> 39:57.290
Yes.

39:57.360 --> 39:59.660
Once he's stabilized.

39:59.730 --> 40:01.860
Good.

40:01.930 --> 40:03.360
I'd like to go now.

40:03.430 --> 40:04.530
Of course.

40:04.600 --> 40:05.600
Thank you.

40:23.950 --> 40:26.290
Walter?

40:26.360 --> 40:28.560
Love, you didn't come home last night.

40:28.620 --> 40:31.030
I was worried about you.

40:31.090 --> 40:32.490
I thought...

40:44.410 --> 40:46.410
How?

40:48.110 --> 40:52.010
He was dying, Elizabeth.

40:52.080 --> 40:54.680
This is the boy I showed you,

40:54.750 --> 40:56.480
the other Peter.

40:59.090 --> 41:01.020
It was the only way I could save him.

41:27.220 --> 41:30.450
Oh.

41:33.720 --> 41:35.390
Oh, god.

41:35.460 --> 41:38.890
Oh, my baby.

41:40.830 --> 41:42.830
Elizabeth, don't.

41:45.870 --> 41:48.370
He's not ours.

41:48.440 --> 41:49.970
I have to take him back.

41:59.980 --> 42:03.520
And I realized at that moment

42:03.590 --> 42:06.790
that despite what I'd promised,

42:06.860 --> 42:09.860
what I fully intended to do...

42:12.860 --> 42:15.060
that I could never take Peter back.

42:19.800 --> 42:22.700
The way she looked at him,

42:22.770 --> 42:26.170
I saw in her what I
feared most in myself

42:26.240 --> 42:28.240
when I saw him...

42:31.780 --> 42:33.720
That I couldn't lose him again.

42:36.920 --> 42:39.550
It was the first hole, Olivia.

42:39.620 --> 42:41.720
The first breach.

42:41.790 --> 42:44.730
The first crack in a pattern of cracks,

42:44.790 --> 42:46.830
spaces between the worlds.

42:50.600 --> 42:52.530
And it's my fault.

43:04.080 --> 43:06.710
You can't imagine what it's like

43:06.780 --> 43:09.650
to lose a child.
