00:35.200 --> 00:36.720
-[man] Captain Daly.
-Report.

00:36.800 --> 00:40.120
A non-federation vessel jumped straight
out of white space right in front of us.

00:41.840 --> 00:43.800
-Valdack.
-That can't be.

00:43.880 --> 00:46.360
My data scan indicates
a heavily armored Gorgan Dreadnought,

00:46.440 --> 00:48.040
vessel ID number 9864321.

00:48.120 --> 00:51.360
Thank you, Dudani. Valdack must have
hijacked it from the Fermi hub

00:51.440 --> 00:52.840
and tracked our position.

00:54.560 --> 00:57.040
-Tulaska, shield status?
-Shields 100%.

00:57.120 --> 00:58.320
-Helmsman Packer?
-Captain.

00:58.400 --> 01:00.400
-Prime rear thrusters.
-Rear thrusters primed.

01:00.480 --> 01:02.680
[Walton]
If that's Valdack, he'll rip us to shreds.

01:03.160 --> 01:05.640
Captain, we have to surrender.
There's no other way.

01:05.720 --> 01:07.760
Let's not lose our heads,
Lieutenant Walton.

01:07.840 --> 01:08.880
[zapping]

01:10.960 --> 01:12.400
-Shields at 68%.
-[alarm wailing]

01:12.480 --> 01:14.560
Heavy damage reported,
decks six through ten.

01:14.640 --> 01:17.280
Fires in med center
and major rupture to cargo bay Alpha.

01:17.360 --> 01:18.240
We've got no choice!

01:18.320 --> 01:20.720
Do you want me to open comms
with Valdack's craft, Captain?

01:20.800 --> 01:22.320
-Negative.
-[zapping]

01:23.080 --> 01:24.080
[all groan]

01:24.160 --> 01:26.800
-Shields at 54%.
-There's no way out.

01:27.600 --> 01:29.840
-Captain, please.
-[Daly] Not now, Walton.

01:30.880 --> 01:35.000
Helmsman Packer,
take us into that asteroid gas cluster.

01:35.080 --> 01:37.440
-Into the cluster?
-That's suicide, sir.

01:37.520 --> 01:38.960
It is our only chance.

01:39.040 --> 01:42.040
[Daly] That gas cluster is charged
with ionized pyron particles.

01:42.120 --> 01:45.480
If our shields hold, we can use them
to increase our photon intensity.

01:45.840 --> 01:47.320
Packer, increase thrusters.

01:47.400 --> 01:49.560
[engine thrusts]

01:49.640 --> 01:51.240
[Tulaska] Shields at 43%.

01:52.320 --> 01:54.040
It'll tear the ship apart, Captain!

01:54.120 --> 01:56.720
Walton, you are a Space Fleet officer.
Act accordingly.

01:56.800 --> 01:58.960
-Shields at 32%.
-Valdack's not following.

01:59.040 --> 02:00.520
Packer, turn us around.

02:01.240 --> 02:02.840
[engine rumbles]

02:04.200 --> 02:07.120
-[Daly] Tulaska, charge photon bolts.
-Bolts charged, Captain.

02:15.400 --> 02:17.400
-Fire!
-[zapping]

02:19.360 --> 02:23.280
His hull's breached, shields gone.
He's defenseless.

02:23.360 --> 02:26.280
-Lieutenant Lowry, open comms.
-He's already hailing us, Captain.

02:26.360 --> 02:27.600
-[Daly] On screen.
-[bleeps]

02:27.680 --> 02:32.720
Captain Daly, may you drown
in the venom of 900 Tragorian snakes!

02:32.800 --> 02:34.800
[Daly] You are defeated, Valdack.

02:34.880 --> 02:37.960
Return the plasmorthian crystal
and we'll cause you no more damage.

02:38.040 --> 02:40.600
You must think me a fool, Captain!

02:40.680 --> 02:45.160
I know the crystal's capabilities,
and I will die before I give it up!

02:45.240 --> 02:48.000
I gave you a chance, Valdack,
showed you mercy.

02:48.640 --> 02:50.720
-Reflect on that while you can.
-[yells]

02:50.800 --> 02:52.360
-Close comms.
-[bleeps]

02:54.000 --> 02:56.240
-Tulaska, destroy his ship.
-Yes, Captain.

02:56.320 --> 02:57.600
[bleeping]

02:58.520 --> 02:59.560
[zaps]

03:01.920 --> 03:05.280
-That was incredible, Captain.
-You saved our lives.

03:05.360 --> 03:07.480
[Walton] I'm so sorry
I lost it back there, Captain.

03:07.560 --> 03:09.720
Not for the first time, Walton.

03:09.800 --> 03:11.520
And I should know by now
never to doubt you.

03:11.600 --> 03:14.000
-[alarm beeps]
-[Walton] Please forgive me.

03:14.840 --> 03:15.960
At ease, Walton.

03:16.040 --> 03:18.680
Captain, sensors indicate
an escape pod ejected

03:18.760 --> 03:20.640
from Valdack's ship before detonation.

03:21.400 --> 03:22.720
He's escaping with the crystal.

03:22.800 --> 03:24.840
You want me to plot
a pursuit course, Captain?

03:26.160 --> 03:27.360
No.

03:28.440 --> 03:31.720
We'll let him go... for now.

03:33.520 --> 03:37.400
-Great decision-making, Captain.
-Three cheers for Captain Daly.

03:37.480 --> 03:39.480
-Hip hip.
-[all] Hooray!

03:39.560 --> 03:41.400

04:37.680 --> 04:39.680
You must renew on first of each month.

04:39.760 --> 04:44.560
Yeah, I know that,
but the first was on the weekend, so...

04:46.480 --> 04:47.400
OK.

04:50.240 --> 04:51.640

Infinity,  from Callister Inc.

05:02.960 --> 05:05.200
-Morning, Mr. Daly.
-Helmsman Packer.

05:05.280 --> 05:06.280
Huh?

05:07.320 --> 05:10.200
Uh, I mean, Mr. Packer. Nate.

05:10.280 --> 05:11.240
[laughs]

05:11.320 --> 05:12.400
OK.

05:13.440 --> 05:15.360
[Daly] Are you making coffees?

05:15.440 --> 05:16.440
Yeah.

05:18.440 --> 05:20.840
Do you think maybe
you could make me one too?

05:23.560 --> 05:26.440
[laughs] Sure, sure. Uh, what do you want?

05:27.280 --> 05:29.720
Just vanilla latte. Skim milk.

05:29.800 --> 05:31.280
Yeah, good call. 'Cause...

[woman]
...those are very, very big numbers.

05:38.040 --> 05:41.920
We might just have to hold you to that.
Well, no, yes, of course. [laughs]

05:42.000 --> 05:43.360
Sure. Yes.

05:43.440 --> 05:44.800
[crashing]

05:44.880 --> 05:46.440
Oh, are you OK, man?

05:47.040 --> 05:47.920

05:48.000 --> 05:50.040
I guess you didn't see my gym bag.

05:51.240 --> 05:53.800
Here. Come on. [strains]

05:53.880 --> 05:55.160
-I'm sorry, bud. [pats]
-OK.

05:55.240 --> 05:57.240
You left it... [groans]

06:00.360 --> 06:02.480

and make it good.

Oh. The ladies' bathroom is that way.
The sign's kind of confusing.

06:31.480 --> 06:34.200
You're Robert Daly, right?

06:36.200 --> 06:38.200
-Right.
-Yeah, hi.

06:39.480 --> 06:41.280
I'm Nanette, Nanette Cole.

06:41.360 --> 06:42.360
Um...

06:43.120 --> 06:45.360
I started here today,
coding on the update,

06:45.440 --> 06:49.600
and I just wanted to, uh,
pass on my admiration

06:49.680 --> 06:53.000
to the person
who actually designed  Infinity.

06:53.440 --> 06:56.520
The procedural algorithm is amazing.

06:56.600 --> 07:00.160
It's just some beautiful code.

07:00.760 --> 07:01.800
Thank you.

07:02.200 --> 07:05.920
That's actually the reason
that I wanted to work here.

07:08.680 --> 07:11.760
-You must be busy. I'm so sorry.
-No, no, it's fine.

07:11.840 --> 07:13.200
-Sorry. [laughs]
-No.

07:13.280 --> 07:16.240
-Well, just fangirling. Sorry. Um...
-[both laugh]

07:16.320 --> 07:17.600

07:17.680 --> 07:20.160
Ooh... vintage.

07:21.320 --> 07:23.840
-Yeah, it's  Space Fleet.
-Wow.

07:23.920 --> 07:27.520
[Daly] It's a TV show. Before your time.

07:28.240 --> 07:29.840
Before my time, actually.

07:30.840 --> 07:33.720
But it was... visionary.

07:35.080 --> 07:36.480
Is this on, like, tape?

07:36.560 --> 07:40.040
Yeah, I've got the VHS, the DVD, Blu-ray.

07:40.120 --> 07:43.080
The whole thing. Seasons one to six.

07:43.720 --> 07:45.560
Netflix has it these days, but...

07:46.240 --> 07:48.840
Aboard the spaceship  USS Callister.

07:48.920 --> 07:50.440
-OK, yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

07:50.520 --> 07:53.160
So-- OK, so Callister is like the, uh--

07:53.240 --> 07:56.360
Yeah, when we set up the company, um...

07:57.360 --> 08:02.920
I suggested we call it Callister
as kind of a little tribute.

08:03.000 --> 08:07.720
Walton didn't really get the reference,
but he let me have that one.

08:12.560 --> 08:14.560
Mini-skirted damsels.

08:14.960 --> 08:16.120
[laughs]

08:16.200 --> 08:17.880
A little cold for that in space.

08:17.960 --> 08:22.360
That is just what a Bargradian
sand warrior would say.

08:22.440 --> 08:23.640
[Nanette chuckles]

08:24.280 --> 08:27.760
[Walton] Bob, Christmas is closing in
like a goddamn meteor.

08:27.840 --> 08:30.600
We've got customers all over our balls
waiting for the  Infinity  update.

08:30.680 --> 08:33.039
Tell me it's gonna be up and running
before the weekend.

08:33.120 --> 08:36.919
-Oh, I'll ask Kabir--
-You're CTO. Don't ask anybody anything.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.720
You should be telling people things
like I'm telling you right now.

08:39.799 --> 08:41.520
-I'll talk to him.
-Good.

08:41.600 --> 08:42.919
-I'm sorry.
-OK.

08:43.960 --> 08:45.160
-Hello.
-[Nanette] Hello.

08:45.240 --> 08:47.520
Sorry, I couldn't find a good moment to...

08:47.600 --> 08:50.480
Oh, you must be new.
Uh... I'm James Walton. I run the company.

08:50.560 --> 08:53.280
-[Nanette] I--
-Well, we run the company, kind of.

08:53.720 --> 08:56.560
Bob here is the hardware,
and I am the shiny front end.

08:57.760 --> 08:59.760
-I'm Nanette Cole.
-[Walton] Which department?

08:59.840 --> 09:02.440
-Engine architecture.
-And it's your first day?

09:02.520 --> 09:03.520
Uh...

09:03.600 --> 09:06.000
-[stutters] Yeah.
-Have you had the tour?

09:06.680 --> 09:08.400
-[keyboard clicking]
-No, I...

09:08.480 --> 09:10.480
Please, allow me.

09:11.960 --> 09:12.880
[Nanette] OK.

09:16.320 --> 09:19.080
It was so nice to meet you. [laughs]

09:20.920 --> 09:22.320
[Walton] Just a little bit.

09:22.400 --> 09:25.000
It's a different environment
I set up here.

09:25.520 --> 09:28.880
People call it a carefree environment.
I call it "care-full."

09:28.960 --> 09:30.800
-[Nanette] Interesting.
-Not scary.

09:30.880 --> 09:32.600
[chattering continuing]

09:36.760 --> 09:37.960
Dudani?

09:40.040 --> 09:41.080
Kabir?

09:41.160 --> 09:42.800
Mm. Mr. Daly.

09:43.360 --> 09:46.880
Do you have the latest ETA
on the update patch?

09:46.960 --> 09:49.160
It's just there's still
some runtime errors.

09:49.240 --> 09:51.920
Well, the thing is, we could have it ready
by end of play today,

09:52.000 --> 09:55.200
but if we had time,
we could alter the trading mechanics,

09:55.280 --> 09:58.600
tweak the critical hit system,
but of course, that'd add another week,

09:58.680 --> 10:00.240
maybe ten days or so.

10:03.320 --> 10:04.320
Mr. Daly?

10:05.720 --> 10:10.960
-Yeah. Yeah, do all of that, thank you.
-I'll... OK, we're on it.

[Walton] Welcome back, Captain.

11:36.360 --> 11:38.400
Have you located Valdack's position?

11:38.480 --> 11:40.920
Not yet, but our sensors
are scanning every star system

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
between here and Valatros.

11:43.480 --> 11:45.480
So your answer is no?

11:48.240 --> 11:49.240
Uh...

11:50.440 --> 11:51.720
I'm afraid so, sir.

11:54.160 --> 11:56.160

You... are pathetic, Walton. What are you?

-[Walton gasping]
-What's that?

12:08.400 --> 12:09.960
[inhales] Pathetic.

[gasps]

12:14.480 --> 12:17.120
[groans, panting]

12:17.960 --> 12:21.480
[Daly] So Valdack's out there somewhere

12:21.560 --> 12:24.640
and you village idiots
are asleep at the wheel.

12:27.240 --> 12:30.840
You're not just disgraceful,
you're disgusting, all of you.

12:31.360 --> 12:35.240
So can you do one thing?

12:36.640 --> 12:38.440
Can you find Valdack?

12:42.200 --> 12:45.960
I'm not asking. I'm telling you!
Understand?

12:46.040 --> 12:47.600
-Hmm?
-Yes.

12:48.040 --> 12:49.640
-[Daly] Yes?
-Yes, Captain. Yeah.

12:49.720 --> 12:51.840
-[Daly] Yes.
-Aye, Captain.

12:52.520 --> 12:53.600
[Daly] Huh?

12:57.320 --> 13:00.080
Well, all right.

13:00.720 --> 13:04.480
Tulaska, check security protocols.
If they've expired, you're in trouble.

13:04.560 --> 13:06.280
-Yes, Captain.
-[bleeping]

13:06.360 --> 13:09.800
Dudani, recheck those probe results.

13:09.880 --> 13:12.200
-No room for errors.
-Of course, Captain.

-Captain.

-At once.

13:23.280 --> 13:24.480
[Daly] Walton.

13:38.600 --> 13:39.680
Exit game.

13:39.760 --> 13:40.760
[device whirs]

13:44.760 --> 13:45.760
[device bleeps]

13:52.760 --> 13:54.800
[keyboard clicking]

13:59.480 --> 14:02.920
Hi, Nanette. You feel like
you have everything you need here?

14:03.000 --> 14:03.840
Mm-hmm.

14:03.920 --> 14:06.480
-All right. That's a nice sweater.
-Oh. Thank you.

14:06.560 --> 14:08.240
-[Walton] Cashmere?
-[chattering]

14:09.920 --> 14:10.920
[knock on door]

14:12.360 --> 14:15.160
Mr. Daly, got that new ETA
on the update patch.

14:16.360 --> 14:17.840
-New ETA?
-Yeah, it's all good.

14:17.920 --> 14:20.080
But now we're looking
at December 24th for rollout.

14:20.160 --> 14:22.000
We don't patch until Christmas Eve?

14:22.080 --> 14:24.560
Well, yeah, I mean,
with the alterations you approved.

14:29.960 --> 14:32.800
OK, OK. Thank you.

14:32.880 --> 14:33.880
[Dudani] OK.

14:34.520 --> 14:35.520
[door closes]

14:37.040 --> 14:37.920
[knock on door]

14:39.360 --> 14:41.480
-Hi, Robert.
-Hi.

14:41.560 --> 14:44.480
Um, I was just gonna fix a coffee.
Do you want one?

14:46.080 --> 14:47.480
-Sure.
-OK.

14:48.760 --> 14:52.280
Um... vanilla latte with skim milk.

14:53.640 --> 14:55.640
-[Nanette] Okey-dokes.
-OK.

14:58.880 --> 15:00.040
Absolutely.

15:00.640 --> 15:02.000
[laughs]

15:02.560 --> 15:03.640
Mm-hmm.

15:03.720 --> 15:05.960
-Well, yes, they are great numbers.
-[machine whirs]

15:06.040 --> 15:07.680
[laughs] OK. Mm-hmm.

15:08.360 --> 15:10.080
-Ta-ta.
-[device beeps]

15:10.160 --> 15:12.320
Total fucking shitwit.

15:13.120 --> 15:17.160
-Do you want coffee?
-Um, Brushed Suede. Thank you.

15:17.240 --> 15:19.560
So how are you settling in?
Are you settling in?

15:20.520 --> 15:25.040
Uh, yeah, yeah.
Everyone here is really friendly.

15:25.120 --> 15:29.960
And um...
it is not like my last job, thank God.

15:30.680 --> 15:33.320
-Yeah?
-It was a toxic workplace, you know.

15:33.400 --> 15:37.720
-My boss was a major-league bully and...
-[machine beeps]

15:37.800 --> 15:40.480
-It's not like here, like with Mr...
-Walton.

15:40.560 --> 15:42.680
-Yeah.
-Oh, yeah. He's a really good guy.

15:43.040 --> 15:44.400
He's a bit of a player.

15:44.480 --> 15:47.320
Chuck a sandwich across the room,
he'll fuck it before it hits the ground,

15:47.400 --> 15:49.960
-but he's basically an all right bloke.
-[chuckles]

15:50.040 --> 15:54.960
OK. [laughs] Well, there's uh...
two bosses here anyway, so I guess--

15:55.040 --> 15:57.720
-Two how?
-Robert Daly.

15:58.360 --> 15:59.280
Oh!

15:59.720 --> 16:02.600
I mean, well, yeah, technically. [scoffs]

16:02.680 --> 16:05.480
Mr. Daly is actually
the whole reason that I'm here.

16:05.560 --> 16:07.440
-Really? Interesting.
-[Nanette] I mean...

16:07.520 --> 16:11.120
Who wouldn't wanna work under
an incredible mind like that, you know?

16:11.200 --> 16:14.160
His coding is... [laughs] It's sublime.

16:15.080 --> 16:16.880
Do you have a thing for him?

16:17.560 --> 16:21.120
Daly? No, no. No. It's not like that.

16:21.200 --> 16:23.440
[stammers] It's purely...
It's professional.

16:23.840 --> 16:25.320
I like his code.

16:25.400 --> 16:27.680
Ah. Fucking hell,
I was gonna say, you know,

16:27.760 --> 16:30.440
don't be too nice to him
'cause he gets a bit starey.

16:31.400 --> 16:32.240
Mm.

16:33.120 --> 16:37.040
Wide berth, that's my advice. Wide berth.

16:37.120 --> 16:38.120
-OK.
-Yeah.

16:38.200 --> 16:39.520
Thank you.

16:45.480 --> 16:46.960
-There you go.
-Thank you.

16:56.040 --> 16:57.400
[exhales]

17:15.310 --> 17:17.720
-[Lowry] Bye.
-No bye. I'm coming.

17:17.800 --> 17:19.349
[Lowry] No. Suck a dick, Karl.

17:19.440 --> 17:20.839
[woman] Later, guys.

18:08.600 --> 18:09.600
[machine beeps]

18:27.560 --> 18:30.560
[whirring]

18:34.320 --> 18:36.120
[beeping]

18:44.560 --> 18:46.600
[automated voice]  Welcome to Callister.

18:47.200 --> 18:48.600
[card beeps]

18:49.240 --> 18:50.160
[Daly] Thank you.

18:50.680 --> 18:51.720
You're welcome.

18:56.880 --> 18:58.480
[chattering]

19:00.240 --> 19:01.520
[Walton] Goddamn it, Robert!

19:02.880 --> 19:04.520
-Christmas Eve. Really?
-Uh...

19:05.360 --> 19:06.360
Not OK.

19:07.280 --> 19:08.480
[door slams]

19:15.880 --> 19:16.960
[keyboard clicking]

19:26.880 --> 19:27.760
[typing]

19:33.680 --> 19:36.440
[electronic whirring]

19:37.800 --> 19:38.800
[gasps]

19:40.080 --> 19:42.120
[whirring]

19:44.640 --> 19:45.640
[gasps]

19:55.160 --> 19:56.160
Oh.

20:05.800 --> 20:07.440
[breathing heavily]

20:23.400 --> 20:25.120
Hello? [echoes]

20:43.600 --> 20:44.600
[gasps]

21:11.040 --> 21:12.280
-[distant chatter]
-[gasps]

21:27.400 --> 21:29.440
[gasping]

21:30.720 --> 21:34.960
Oh, boy. It looks like
there's a new girl in the office.

21:37.160 --> 21:38.680
What's your name, hon?

21:39.360 --> 21:41.000
[Walton] Come in. Let me fix you a drink.

21:41.080 --> 21:45.160
We have everything
from Bengarian phlegm shots to uh...

21:45.240 --> 21:48.240
ooh, distilled root blood
from the Cangor quadrant.

21:48.320 --> 21:52.240
What's your poison? Some of this
actually is poison, so don't be shy.

21:54.080 --> 21:55.240
Am I dreaming?

21:56.600 --> 21:58.840
Yeah, no, no, 'fraid not.

21:58.920 --> 22:01.280
-I remember dreaming.
-[Packer] Me too.

22:02.200 --> 22:03.400
[Nanette] But where am I?

22:03.960 --> 22:06.440
This is the  USS Callister,
Space Fleet's finest,

22:06.520 --> 22:09.960
exploring the furthest reaches
of the known universe and beyond.

22:10.040 --> 22:14.080
We are its loyal space crew
and now, apparently, so are you. Cheers.

22:14.480 --> 22:15.960
[slurps]

22:16.040 --> 22:18.480
Your name? Babe, what's your name?

22:18.560 --> 22:21.160
Nanette. We've met.

22:21.920 --> 22:25.160
Maybe, in the real world.
I wouldn't have no way of knowing.

22:26.000 --> 22:29.240
-What do you mean?
-You'd better sit down.

22:29.320 --> 22:31.800
No, I don't... I don't wanna sit down.

22:32.680 --> 22:34.440
I wanna know what's going on.

22:34.520 --> 22:36.240
You're on board Robert Daly's ship.

22:37.160 --> 22:39.280
Robert Daly, the CTO?

22:39.360 --> 22:42.280
Here he's Captain Daly,
our fearless leader.

22:42.360 --> 22:45.160
[Lowry] Yeah, you're seriously
gonna need to sit the fuck down.

22:46.200 --> 22:47.760
-Uh...
-Welcome. [chuckles]

22:48.800 --> 22:53.400
You are um... Hey, hey.
You're the intern from work, right? Nate?

22:53.480 --> 22:55.440
Packer. Nate Packer.

22:55.520 --> 22:58.600
Wait. So I'm still
just the intern out there?

22:59.400 --> 23:00.480
Jesus.

23:00.920 --> 23:02.680
You're um... You're... You're...

23:03.200 --> 23:05.280
Dudani. Diagnostics.

23:06.160 --> 23:08.360
-Welcome.
-Right.

23:12.160 --> 23:14.720
-You're the receptionist, right?
-Elena.

23:15.240 --> 23:18.360
-Your skin is blue.
-[Tulaska] Weird blue alien skin, I know.

23:18.440 --> 23:20.120
It's fucked up.

23:20.880 --> 23:22.400
Almost sort of racist.

23:23.760 --> 23:24.800
[groans]

23:25.320 --> 23:29.840
[strains] OK. Walt, fix her something,
something she'll recognize. Vodka.

23:29.920 --> 23:32.280
-Hey. So what's it like out there now?
-What?

23:32.360 --> 23:34.320
-What year is it?
-[Lowry] Don't do her head in.

23:34.400 --> 23:38.440
-[Packer] What?
-What year? I... [stutters] saw you today.

23:38.520 --> 23:41.400
Ooh. Did you see me? Did I look thin? Hmm?

23:41.800 --> 23:43.360
Like, wheatgrass yogurt thin?

23:44.160 --> 23:46.040
Can we not pop her fucking mind?

23:46.120 --> 23:48.960
Someone needs
to be straight with me right now.

23:49.360 --> 23:52.360
OK. OK, listen.

23:53.080 --> 23:54.240
This is  Infinity.

23:54.960 --> 23:59.920
That's what we're all inside.
That's where all of this exists.

24:00.920 --> 24:02.400
Infinity , the game?

24:03.320 --> 24:05.520
Daly's got his own modded version
of  Infinity,

24:05.600 --> 24:07.600
reskinned to look like
his favorite TV show.

24:07.680 --> 24:10.640
-Space Thing? Space Thing?
-Space Fleet.

24:10.720 --> 24:13.360
-Hence the groovy decor.
-And this tasteful get-up.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.440
Infinity.

24:15.520 --> 24:18.360
That's an online game,
like a multiplayer deal. This... [inhales]

24:18.440 --> 24:22.960
This is his development build,
sealed off so he can control it.

24:23.560 --> 24:24.600
He keeps it offline

24:24.680 --> 24:27.080
so the custom code he's written
can't be detected and deleted.

24:27.160 --> 24:31.040
Mm. Yes, it's a bubble universe,
ruled by an asshole god.

24:32.760 --> 24:33.640
He...

24:35.600 --> 24:37.880
put us in... in here?

24:37.960 --> 24:38.840
Mm-hmm.

24:38.920 --> 24:40.040
Drink your vodka.

24:41.280 --> 24:43.520
-How do we get out?
-No, really, drink it.

24:44.440 --> 24:45.400
Drink it.

24:49.520 --> 24:51.680
-You can't leave.
-[chokes] What?

24:51.760 --> 24:53.040
None of us can.

24:53.880 --> 24:56.440
-Because you're not actually you.
-[Nanette] What?

24:57.120 --> 25:01.080
I know it's mental,
but you're a copy of you.

25:01.160 --> 25:02.600
-A digital clone.
-No.

25:02.680 --> 25:05.640
No, I am... I'm me. I am me.

25:05.720 --> 25:07.360
-I'm me.
-[Walton] No, not the real you.

25:07.440 --> 25:11.800
Daly's created an identical
digital version of you, of all of us.

25:12.880 --> 25:15.160
From your DNA.
He'll have harvested it somehow.

25:15.240 --> 25:17.800
He told me he got mine
from the rim of a smoothie cup.

25:17.880 --> 25:19.840
He retrieved Packer's juices
from the bathroom.

25:19.920 --> 25:22.520
Man, you have got to let that go.
She does not need details.

25:22.600 --> 25:24.120
Basically he's got a gizmo--

25:24.200 --> 25:26.120
I theorize an advanced
biometric DNA virtual clone.

25:26.200 --> 25:28.120
He's got a fucking gizmo.
That's what I said.

25:28.200 --> 25:30.920
He fed your DNA in,
he put you inside his computer

25:31.000 --> 25:33.280
and, bam, you pop up here like a Pop-Tart.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.600
Yeah, we've all been through it.

25:36.080 --> 25:39.840
He brings us in for different reasons,
shit we did in the office.

25:40.400 --> 25:41.680
I called him out for staring.

25:41.760 --> 25:44.720
I reset admin permissions
on a test build for 14 minutes.

25:44.800 --> 25:46.440
Insufficient smiling.

25:46.520 --> 25:49.640
-I brought him the wrong sandwich.
-OK, never mind the reasons.

25:49.720 --> 25:52.320
The point is that we're stuck
in Daly's playground,

25:52.400 --> 25:54.120
and that's all you need to know.

25:54.200 --> 25:57.920
This is a dream. Yeah, it has to be.

25:58.520 --> 26:03.480
It's more like an eternal waking nightmare
from which there is no escape.

26:04.760 --> 26:08.160
-No, no. No, no, no. No, no, no.
-[Lowry] Oh, for fuck's sake,

26:08.240 --> 26:09.840
I'm trying to break her in gently.

26:09.920 --> 26:11.680
The quicker she gets it,
the easier it'll be.

26:12.240 --> 26:13.160
[whirring]

26:13.240 --> 26:14.680
[Tulaska] Daddy's home.

26:15.200 --> 26:16.640
[Packer] He'll be here any moment.

26:17.520 --> 26:19.120
[Nanette] No. I'm gonna get out of here.

26:19.200 --> 26:21.120
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
You gotta stay on the bridge.

26:21.200 --> 26:22.240
He controls everything.

26:22.320 --> 26:24.120
-He does shit to make us cooperate.
-Get off.

26:24.200 --> 26:27.040
-You have no idea. I'm trying to help.
-[Lowry] Just leave it.

26:27.120 --> 26:29.040
He's gonna fuck us up
if she doesn't play ball.

26:29.120 --> 26:32.240
Yes, well, she's gonna have to work it out
for herself, like we all did.

26:32.920 --> 26:34.120
[panting]

26:36.800 --> 26:38.720
[spaceship whirring]

26:40.280 --> 26:41.160
[groans]

26:42.960 --> 26:44.960
-There's gotta be a way out. Come on.
-[beeps]

26:50.600 --> 26:52.280
[whimpers]

26:52.360 --> 26:54.960
[screaming]

27:01.320 --> 27:02.320
[whimpers]

27:03.800 --> 27:07.200
Lieutenant Cole, welcome aboard.

27:07.280 --> 27:11.760
Crew, we have a new member of the team,
Science Officer Nanette Cole.

27:11.840 --> 27:13.760
Please, take your post.

27:13.840 --> 27:18.120
I believe we've finally managed
to track Valdack to an uncharted planet.

27:18.200 --> 27:20.640
-No.
-Take your post. That is an order.

27:20.720 --> 27:23.400
I'm not doing this.

27:25.080 --> 27:27.560
The whole thing's much better
if you let yourself get into it.

27:27.640 --> 27:32.080
If you think that I'm playing along
with your  Space Force  bullshit...

27:32.160 --> 27:33.920
-Space Fleet.
-[Nanette] Whatever.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.720
-You can think again.
-This is my ship.

27:37.640 --> 27:41.080
-I am your captain. An order is an order.
-Then go fuck yourself.

27:42.400 --> 27:43.480
Sir.

27:43.560 --> 27:47.560
OK. So we're doing it this way.

27:49.400 --> 27:50.280
[scoffs]

27:51.360 --> 27:53.080
[mocking] Are you gonna throw a fireball?

27:56.720 --> 27:57.600
[snaps fingers]

27:58.040 --> 28:01.120
[muffled gasps]

28:02.120 --> 28:03.280
[thuds]

28:03.360 --> 28:04.520
[muffled sounds]

28:04.600 --> 28:09.800
Oh, dear. You can't see.
You can't breathe.

28:09.880 --> 28:11.000
Unpleasant, isn't it?

28:12.560 --> 28:13.840
[muffled groaning]

28:13.920 --> 28:15.120
Do you submit?

28:16.560 --> 28:18.000
You won't die, you know.

28:19.960 --> 28:22.840
No one dies in here unless I want them to.

28:24.280 --> 28:28.160
I can keep you like this forever
if I feel like it.

28:28.240 --> 28:31.840
Forever gasping for breath
with a mouth that isn't there.

28:32.240 --> 28:34.760
Do you submit?

28:34.840 --> 28:35.920
[muffled agreement]

28:37.720 --> 28:38.680
Good girl.

28:39.880 --> 28:42.560
[gasps, coughing]

28:44.600 --> 28:47.080
[breathes heavily]

28:47.160 --> 28:51.160
Lieutenant Cole, Valdack's hideout.
Triangulate the signal, please.

28:56.320 --> 28:58.520
[Nanette pants]

29:02.960 --> 29:04.680
[sobs]

29:09.840 --> 29:12.560
[whispers]
It's any button. They're all the same.

29:13.800 --> 29:14.800
[beeps]

29:14.880 --> 29:16.000
[beeps]

29:16.080 --> 29:17.160
Well?

29:17.240 --> 29:21.080
[gasping] I'm getting a signal
from a class five planet.

29:21.160 --> 29:23.400
-Rannotch.
-[Lowry] Rannoch.

29:24.520 --> 29:26.400
[stutters, whispers] Rannoch B.

29:27.960 --> 29:30.600
Excellent. Dudani,
prepare the transmat system.

29:30.680 --> 29:33.520
-Of course, Captain.
-Walton, Packer, Lowry, with me.

29:33.600 --> 29:35.920
We'll transport down to the planet,
reclaim the crystal

29:36.000 --> 29:37.960
and bring Valdack to justice.

29:39.680 --> 29:42.880
Actually, Cole, you come too.

29:42.960 --> 29:44.600
Perfect opportunity for you to prove

29:44.680 --> 29:47.920
you're more than a recommendation
from Space Fleet. What do you say?

29:57.680 --> 30:00.160
-Mr. Dudani, transport.
-Aye aye, Captain.

30:07.400 --> 30:08.400
[all exhale]

30:08.480 --> 30:11.160
[Nanette gasps, groans]

30:17.280 --> 30:19.120
[Daly] Breathable atmosphere.

30:19.200 --> 30:21.200
[device whirs]

30:21.280 --> 30:23.760
Scanning for plasmorthian traces.

30:26.200 --> 30:28.160
Crystal's this way. Let's go.

30:28.240 --> 30:31.320
-Nate. Hey, Nate.
-Helmsman Packer, OK?

30:31.400 --> 30:34.440
Call me Helmsman Packer. He hates it
when we don't use our proper titles.

30:34.520 --> 30:36.560
OK. You got a gun, so let's take him out.

30:36.640 --> 30:39.320
-Then give it to me.
-OK, one, our guns don't even work.

30:39.400 --> 30:44.200
Only his does. And two, the motherfucker
is invincible, OK? Come on, let's go.

30:49.000 --> 30:50.400
At least you've got a gun.

30:51.120 --> 30:53.440
[device whirring]

30:55.400 --> 30:56.440
-Captain.
-[Daly] Shh.

30:56.520 --> 30:59.240
We meet again, Captain Daly!

30:59.320 --> 31:02.800
[cackles]

31:03.240 --> 31:04.680
-We're trapped.
-[gun whirs]

31:05.520 --> 31:06.960
Not advisable.

31:07.040 --> 31:10.480
My plasma grenade
will turn you into screaming soup.

31:10.840 --> 31:12.360
He's not going to kill us, Captain.

31:12.440 --> 31:15.800
He had the element of surprise.
He'd have done it when he had the chance.

31:15.880 --> 31:19.200
Haven't worked out how to use the crystal,
have you, Valdack?

31:19.280 --> 31:22.760
It's true, I require
your Space Fleet knowledge.

31:22.840 --> 31:25.640
But it's also true
that you're gonna give it to me!

31:25.720 --> 31:26.720
Don't be so sure.

31:26.800 --> 31:28.480
[laughs]

31:28.560 --> 31:30.560
-Jesus. I...
-Shh.

31:31.560 --> 31:33.800
Let's see how your resolve holds up

31:33.880 --> 31:39.320
once you're devoured one by one
by my Arachnajax!

31:39.400 --> 31:41.440
[roars]

31:41.520 --> 31:44.520
-Holy shit. Oh, my God.
-[Walton] We're all gonna die.

[Arachnajax snarls, snorts]

31:53.760 --> 31:54.760
[roars]

31:56.360 --> 31:59.600
Killing us won't make us tell you
how the crystal works, Valdack.

32:00.080 --> 32:03.200
-We will never...
-[device rings]

32:03.840 --> 32:06.240
Hold on. I think my pizza's here.

32:12.880 --> 32:14.400
[Nanette] What's happening?

32:14.480 --> 32:16.280
[Walton] You heard him.
He paused the game.

32:16.360 --> 32:19.400
'Cause he's got a pizza delivery...
out there.

32:42.000 --> 32:45.280
Ah. That's good.
This launcher's heavy as shit.

32:47.280 --> 32:48.680
[Valdack] How you holding up?

32:48.760 --> 32:50.440
You know, we're existing.

32:51.560 --> 32:52.840
How you doing, Gillian?

32:53.680 --> 32:55.360
[Arachnajax grunts]

32:56.240 --> 32:57.520
Well, yeah.

32:59.560 --> 33:01.800
-[Walton] Well, you look great.
-Her name's Gillian.

33:01.880 --> 33:04.120
-[Walton] Did you lose weight?
-She was in marketing.

33:04.200 --> 33:07.320
Yeah, Daly turned her into... that

33:07.400 --> 33:09.880
because she wouldn't play along
when he cloned her into here.

33:09.960 --> 33:12.880
[Lowry] This universe is littered
with things like her,

33:12.960 --> 33:15.200
poor fuckers who stepped out of line.

33:17.720 --> 33:19.320
-Thank you.
-[man] Thanks.

Hey. Hey.

If we die, the secret of the crystal dies
with us, Valdack.

Oh, my God. We   are all gonna die!

Over there. A naked lady.

[Walton] Unparalleled tactics, Captain.

[panting]

34:15.880 --> 34:19.000
We've fought many battles,
haven't we, Captain?

34:19.080 --> 34:20.120
We have.

34:20.630 --> 34:25.480
And I've been a good adversary for you,
have I not?

34:28.960 --> 34:30.120

34:30.199 --> 34:31.120
Then please...

-Please.

-Transport us aboard.
-Yes, Captain.

-Great mercy-showing, Captain.

Tomorrow you should reconsider
your... amenability.

Wasn't too bad. Usual standoff storyline.

-Ooh. Saw Gillian from marketing. Yeah.
-Oh.

36:21.320 --> 36:24.360
There is no way
that I am kissing that asshole.

Then he's just gonna get
more and more pissed.

-How about you kiss him, then?
-[Lowry] You get used to it.

36:29.000 --> 36:30.560
It's-- There's no tongues.

36:30.640 --> 36:33.000
If that's any consolation,
there's never any tongues.

36:33.080 --> 36:35.160
-Doing tongues is not Space Fleet way.
-Mm.

36:35.240 --> 36:37.560
It's not like it can go
beyond kissing anyway.

Oh. You haven't noticed?

There's no genitals in Space Fleet.
This is a wholesome universe.

[Dudani] He must have modified
our code that way.

36:57.280 --> 37:01.360
Mm. We're all the same. If you don't
believe me, take a look down there.

37:01.440 --> 37:04.160
We have tried grinding our mounds
together out of sheer boredom.

37:06.680 --> 37:09.200
-No sensation at all.
-Can't even shit.

37:42.800 --> 37:44.200
He's a coder.

37:45.360 --> 37:46.680
He is fallible.

Kabir, what was that thing he was holding
in his hand, that scanner thing?

37:58.120 --> 38:00.360
His omnicorder,

38:00.440 --> 38:02.400
You said he kept his version
of the game offline.

38:02.840 --> 38:07.000
But the omnicorder made contact with
the outside world when the pizza came,

38:07.080 --> 38:10.160
so it's gotta be connected
to his home system at least.

38:10.240 --> 38:11.320
The omnicorder's gone.

when he goes, and that's the only one.

Wha... No.

Oh. We are getting out of here!

41:11.840 --> 41:13.680
[door slides shut]

41:24.160 --> 41:26.040
[Daly] What is Space Fleet?

41:29.840 --> 41:31.200
I'll tell you what it is.

41:33.240 --> 41:35.640
It is a belief system...

41:37.720 --> 41:39.960
founded on the very best of human nature.

41:42.680 --> 41:47.360
It is a goal for us to strive towards

41:49.280 --> 41:51.480
for the betterment of the universe,

41:53.080 --> 41:55.080
for the betterment of life itself.

41:59.640 --> 42:04.080
And you assholes are fucking it up!

42:04.160 --> 42:05.680
I did it. I did. I did it.

42:06.640 --> 42:09.560
I sent the message. It was me.

42:11.000 --> 42:13.720
No one else was involved, I swear.

42:13.800 --> 42:15.760
I tried the carrot. Now meet the stick.

42:15.840 --> 42:18.760
No, this is gonna make you happy,
Daly, 'cause you're sick.

42:21.280 --> 42:22.320
And you need help.

42:23.440 --> 42:24.560
[Lowry] No, don't, don't!

42:25.240 --> 42:26.200
Captain.

42:28.080 --> 42:29.240
Captain, please.

42:30.280 --> 42:33.480
[Lowry]
OK, look, she's new. She'll behave.

42:34.000 --> 42:35.360
We'll all behave.

42:37.440 --> 42:40.280
Just let her off. Let her off this once.

42:42.160 --> 42:43.600
[stuttering] Please.

42:46.280 --> 42:47.160
OK.

42:47.240 --> 42:48.480
[gasps]

42:48.560 --> 42:49.400
OK.

42:50.320 --> 42:51.280
OK.

42:52.880 --> 42:55.960
-[Nanette] No! Daly, no! No, no, no, no!
-[cracking]

42:57.160 --> 42:59.400
-[screams, inhuman grunts]
-[cracking]

43:01.000 --> 43:02.320
[roars]

43:05.800 --> 43:07.960
[cracking]

43:09.360 --> 43:11.080
[roars]

43:14.400 --> 43:16.840
-[growls]
-[Nanette whimpers]

43:17.520 --> 43:18.960
[gasping]

43:19.040 --> 43:20.960
[Daly] You know what makes me happy?

43:21.760 --> 43:23.520
The look on your face right now.

43:24.040 --> 43:26.000
[whimpers]

43:26.080 --> 43:30.040
[Daly] Dudani, Walton, Tulaska,
take this thing to the brig with Valdack.

43:30.120 --> 43:32.720
Packer, find a barren planet
we can dump her on.

43:36.720 --> 43:41.760
And you... can just stay here
and think about your attitude.

43:41.840 --> 43:43.960
-[sobs]
-[Daly] Exit game.

43:45.920 --> 43:48.480
[Nanette gasping]

44:19.120 --> 44:21.160
[distant rumbling]

44:29.800 --> 44:32.800
[breathes heavily]

44:36.760 --> 44:38.080
[bleeps]

44:44.640 --> 44:45.760
Update patch.

44:47.760 --> 44:49.280
[exhales]

44:49.360 --> 44:50.680
The update patch.

44:52.480 --> 44:53.680
[Nanette] It's there, there.

44:55.080 --> 44:57.600
-So what? It's a wormhole.
-[Nanette] Unh-unh.

44:57.680 --> 45:00.760
That is the Christmas update patch
preinstalling itself.

45:00.840 --> 45:04.080
The wormhole... it's just how
the game is expressing the uplink.

45:04.160 --> 45:05.000
So?

45:05.080 --> 45:07.280
Daly's custom build
is still connected to the internet.

45:07.800 --> 45:08.680
Some way.

45:08.760 --> 45:10.240
If this is another one of your plans,

45:10.320 --> 45:12.920
just stop before somebody else
gets monsterfied.

45:13.000 --> 45:14.800
No, no, this... this can work.

45:14.880 --> 45:18.040
We can't get all-in access from the ship.
He'll have crippled permissions.

45:18.120 --> 45:21.560
Yes, but what if we fly into the wormhole?

45:22.040 --> 45:25.400
-[scoffs] Like, on purpose?
-We'd hit the system firewall.

45:25.480 --> 45:28.640
-Exactly. Yeah.
-And have our rogue coding deleted.

45:28.720 --> 45:30.920
-Deleted as in...?
-As in die.

45:31.000 --> 45:34.400
Whether it's dying would depend
on your position regarding sentient code--

45:34.480 --> 45:38.400
We would cease to exist, that's true.
But we'd be free.

45:39.840 --> 45:41.960
We'd be... free.

45:44.480 --> 45:47.080
This is academic since we have no means
of getting to the wormhole.

45:47.160 --> 45:49.360
There's no way to pilot the damn thing
without Daly here

45:49.440 --> 45:51.360
and he can stop us like that.
[snaps fingers]

45:51.440 --> 45:54.200
What about if he's logged in
but on pause?

45:54.280 --> 45:56.680
Like when his pizza came,
he was just frozen there.

45:56.760 --> 45:59.640
Flying would be possible,
but that wormhole's a whole parsec away.

45:59.720 --> 46:01.280
We'd never reach it before he got back.

46:01.360 --> 46:03.360
[Nanette]
Unless we stalled him for longer.

46:03.440 --> 46:04.640
[Tulaska] And that we do how?

46:04.720 --> 46:08.640
If we can get Daly's omnicorder,
we can make a phone call, right?

46:08.720 --> 46:10.200
Theoretically, yes, but--

46:10.280 --> 46:14.560
If we can get real me on the phone again,
I, um... I may have some leverage.

46:14.640 --> 46:16.800
-Leverage? On yourself?
-Mm-hmm.

46:18.280 --> 46:21.800
-Like what?
-My PhotoCloud account.

46:22.280 --> 46:24.000
I know the password, obviously.

46:24.080 --> 46:26.080
There are some pretty...

46:28.480 --> 46:32.360
interesting images on there that I should
have deleted a while ago, but I didn't.

46:32.440 --> 46:35.760
So, we can blackmail me.

46:35.840 --> 46:39.960
I'm pretty sure that I'd do anything
to keep those photos from getting out.

46:40.040 --> 46:41.120
Must be pretty pictures.

46:41.200 --> 46:46.400
Look, if this is going to work,
we all have to be in on it.

46:48.040 --> 46:49.200
OK?

46:49.280 --> 46:51.440
[Walton and Packer sigh]

46:51.520 --> 46:53.160
Flying into certain death in a wormhole

46:53.240 --> 46:55.800
beats another 10,000 years
with Captain Ass.

46:57.240 --> 46:58.800
-I'm in.
-OK.

47:01.320 --> 47:02.160
Me too.

47:04.200 --> 47:05.920
-Also me.
-[Nanette exhales]

47:07.960 --> 47:10.760
Well, I am out.

47:13.240 --> 47:16.600
[Walton sighs]
Daly won. Daly's always won.

47:16.680 --> 47:20.320
We just have to get on with it...
'cause we don't have a chance.

47:20.400 --> 47:22.600
-[Nanette] Yes, we do.
-Hmm?

47:22.680 --> 47:27.160
We fly into the wormhole
and we are extinct.

47:27.240 --> 47:29.960
We are gone. We are rid of his shit.

47:30.520 --> 47:31.640
Sounds peachy.

47:32.440 --> 47:33.560
What is with you?

47:34.680 --> 47:39.360
Don't you wanna fight back?
Why won't you fight back?

47:39.760 --> 47:40.600
Tommy.

47:41.800 --> 47:43.800
-Who is Tommy?
-[Walton] He's my son.

47:45.800 --> 47:49.360
He's six years old,
at least he was when I woke up in here.

47:50.520 --> 47:54.600
See, in the early days of this ship,
it was just me and Daly.

47:56.920 --> 47:59.040
I was his pet project.

47:59.920 --> 48:02.360
He tried everything to break me,

48:03.240 --> 48:06.880
and I withstood it all
'cause I just thought

48:07.480 --> 48:12.080
there was still a chance I could get out
and see my boy again.

48:12.160 --> 48:14.600
In a way, I was right,
I did get to see him again.

48:16.920 --> 48:18.120
Just not the real him.

48:21.080 --> 48:23.080
Daly told me what happened.

48:24.480 --> 48:30.080
Back on the outside, the real me, uh...
brought Tommy to work one day,

48:31.240 --> 48:32.520
showed him around.

48:32.600 --> 48:34.640
He would've loved
seeing all those computers.

48:36.040 --> 48:37.680
He's really into that stuff.

48:38.720 --> 48:42.880
Anyway, evidently...
Tommy had a lollipop that day.

48:46.520 --> 48:47.880
That's all Daly needed.

48:55.840 --> 48:58.560
He copied him in here.

48:59.440 --> 49:00.880
It was Tommy all right.

49:03.200 --> 49:04.840
He was alike in every way.

49:04.920 --> 49:06.000
Dad!

49:06.600 --> 49:08.680
[Tommy]  Daddy...

49:08.760 --> 49:10.240
You know what he did to him?

49:12.480 --> 49:13.360
[Walton] Tommy!

49:13.440 --> 49:16.320
He took Tommy
and he threw him out of the airlock.

49:16.400 --> 49:19.160
-[Walton] Tommy!
-Daddy!

49:19.240 --> 49:20.520
[capsule depressurizes]

49:20.600 --> 49:25.120
-Right out into space.
-Daddy! No!

49:25.200 --> 49:26.440
And he made me watch.

49:27.480 --> 49:29.120
[capsule releases]

49:29.680 --> 49:31.640
Tommy!

49:34.920 --> 49:37.880
Have you ever seen an unsuited body
compress in space?

49:42.080 --> 49:43.320
They freeze...

49:45.640 --> 49:48.320
and crack like a porcelain doll.

50:01.400 --> 50:04.080
I take my hat off to Daly. [sniffles]

50:04.600 --> 50:08.080
The detail in this place is exceptional.

50:11.760 --> 50:15.160
And he said he'd do it again and again,

50:15.720 --> 50:18.240
'cause Daly's still got Tommy's DNA.

50:18.320 --> 50:20.160
He's got all of our DNA.

50:20.800 --> 50:24.440
He keeps it in his bedroom
in a fucking mini fridge by his desk.

50:25.480 --> 50:28.560
So I have to stay in line,

50:29.440 --> 50:33.080
because even if we die in here,
he can bring us back.

50:33.160 --> 50:36.480
He can bring Tommy back
whenever he wants.

50:37.960 --> 50:40.160
And God knows how
he'd take it out on him.

50:42.280 --> 50:43.840
God knows what he'd do.

50:45.800 --> 50:49.840
So, you see, what choice do I have?

50:57.400 --> 50:58.440
Walton.

51:00.440 --> 51:03.480
We are gonna get that fucking lollipop.

51:03.560 --> 51:05.200
[Walton sighs]

51:06.560 --> 51:08.120
But you gotta believe me.

51:10.720 --> 51:11.680
Can you do that?

51:15.440 --> 51:16.400
Can you?

51:28.640 --> 51:29.600
[bleeps]

51:33.120 --> 51:34.120
[door slams]

51:43.680 --> 51:44.680
[slurping]

51:50.000 --> 51:51.080
[mouse clicks]

51:54.720 --> 51:57.560
[triumphant music]

51:57.640 --> 51:59.760
Good to see you at your position, Cole.

52:01.440 --> 52:03.840
Captain, you've come
at just the right time.

52:05.120 --> 52:06.080
I have?

52:06.680 --> 52:09.880
I'm picking up a distress signal
from the surface of Skillane IV.

52:09.960 --> 52:12.400
Looks like a crashed shuttle.

52:14.400 --> 52:15.720
What should we do?

52:23.680 --> 52:26.920
Space Fleet never turns its back
on those who need our help.

52:28.320 --> 52:31.040
-Dudani, set a course for Skillane IV.
-Aye aye, sir.

52:31.120 --> 52:33.800
We'll send a search party.
Packer, Tulaska--

52:33.880 --> 52:37.720
Actually, Captain, I was thinking
maybe you could take me alone.

52:38.840 --> 52:41.800
As science officer,
I need to learn the ropes,

52:41.880 --> 52:46.080
and I could use your close attention.

52:52.000 --> 52:53.080
Good.

52:56.400 --> 52:57.520
Yes, good idea.

53:04.720 --> 53:06.360
[Nanette exhales]

53:17.240 --> 53:19.280
[omnicorder whirs]

53:21.120 --> 53:22.320
[Daly] Atmosphere's good.

53:22.400 --> 53:24.840
[omnicorder clicking]

53:24.920 --> 53:26.080
[Daly] Over there.

53:33.520 --> 53:37.040
[Daly]  From here,
the shuttle appears to be deserted.

53:38.120 --> 53:41.320
We'll scout the area,
check for any life forms. Daly out.

53:46.120 --> 53:48.960
Cole, we should head out this way. Cole...

53:49.040 --> 53:51.000
[Nanette]
It's kind of hot here, don't you think?

53:51.720 --> 53:52.920
Oh, my God.

53:53.440 --> 53:55.280
[Daly]  What are you doing, Cole?

53:55.360 --> 53:57.560
[Nanette]
The water looks so inviting, doesn't it?

53:58.720 --> 54:00.960
[Daly] What are you talking about?

54:02.760 --> 54:04.840
[Nanette] Come on, Robert.

54:04.920 --> 54:06.920
-Ooh!
-[splashes]

54:07.000 --> 54:09.720
Oh, the water is great. [laughs]

54:10.520 --> 54:13.240
Swimming is a leisure activity.

54:13.320 --> 54:15.520
We're on Space Fleet duty.

54:15.600 --> 54:16.680
You know what?

54:17.680 --> 54:21.360
We could always say
that I started drowning

54:21.920 --> 54:26.360
and you had to come in and rescue me.

54:27.040 --> 54:28.000
Yeah?

54:29.040 --> 54:32.160
Oh, what about that? [laughs]

54:32.240 --> 54:34.520
Come on. Come on in.

54:34.600 --> 54:37.400
[laughs] I... Cole.

54:37.480 --> 54:40.520
-[laughs] Come on.
-Cole.

54:41.800 --> 54:42.720
Come on.

54:43.360 --> 54:46.840
Come on in, my big captain.

54:49.480 --> 54:50.800
OK.

54:53.400 --> 54:54.480
[Nanette] Come on.

54:56.160 --> 54:57.600
Are you gonna take all day?

54:59.120 --> 55:00.400
[Daly] OK.

55:01.200 --> 55:03.920
-OK, I'm coming in.
-[Nanette giggles]

55:08.600 --> 55:10.240
[beeps]

55:12.160 --> 55:14.200
OK, gotta patch it in.

55:15.560 --> 55:16.960
[keyboard beeps]

55:17.720 --> 55:19.440
[Dudani] It worked. I'm connected.

55:19.520 --> 55:22.280
-Gonna access her PhotoCloud account.
-You remember that password?

55:22.360 --> 55:25.800
Uppercase Y998, lowercase gb7,
uppercase TY ampersand 4.

55:26.360 --> 55:27.640
Secure choice.

55:31.800 --> 55:34.400
[sighs] There are thousands of images.
This could take a while.

55:37.280 --> 55:38.240
Boring life.

55:38.320 --> 55:40.080
[scrolling]

55:47.720 --> 55:50.560
[scrolling]

55:50.640 --> 55:52.640
Goddamn.

55:53.400 --> 55:57.040
That is... gymnastic physique.

55:58.040 --> 56:00.120
It's nice... nice bedding.

56:00.760 --> 56:03.560
[scrolling]

56:06.680 --> 56:09.160
Oh. OK, should I keep scrolling?

56:09.240 --> 56:10.880
Any of the last nine would do.

56:15.440 --> 56:16.440
Ow!

56:17.160 --> 56:19.800
-[laughs] Thank you.
-Pleasure.

56:19.880 --> 56:21.720
-Um, are you heading out for the night?
-Yes.

56:21.800 --> 56:24.840
Because it's Christmas Eve and we've got
ten days off work to recover from it.

56:25.320 --> 56:26.440
Go home.

56:26.520 --> 56:29.960
-I will. I just have to finish--
-Yeah, whatever. Merry Christmas, loser.

56:30.040 --> 56:33.080
[laughs] Yeah. OK, Merry Christmas.

56:35.360 --> 56:36.640
[clears throat]

56:36.720 --> 56:38.280
[phone vibrates]

56:40.560 --> 56:41.560
[gasps]

56:43.280 --> 56:44.280
Oh, my God.

56:45.880 --> 56:47.560
Elliott, you fucking asshole.

56:52.040 --> 56:53.360
[phone vibrates]

56:59.800 --> 57:00.640
[beeps]

57:00.720 --> 57:03.560
[robotic voice]  Nanette Cole,
we've hacked your PhotoCloud account

57:03.640 --> 57:07.080
and have control of the entire contents
of your photo gallery.

57:07.160 --> 57:09.360
Who is this? Um...

57:10.160 --> 57:11.720
[stutters] What do you want?

57:11.800 --> 57:15.000
What we want is for you to do
exactly as instructed

57:15.080 --> 57:16.400
or your entire gallery

57:16.480 --> 57:18.720
will be shared
with your friends and your family.

57:19.680 --> 57:20.880
And PornHub.

57:20.960 --> 57:22.240
[Nanette]  OK, yeah.

57:22.320 --> 57:24.360
[stuttering]
I'll do what you want, anything.

57:25.280 --> 57:26.480
I'll do anything.

57:26.560 --> 57:28.360
Then listen carefully.
We don't have much time.

57:28.840 --> 57:31.400
Stand up, get your coat
and follow our instructions.

57:31.480 --> 57:32.320
[Nanette] OK.

57:32.400 --> 57:34.440
[giggling]

57:34.520 --> 57:36.960
-[Daly] Where are we going?
-We're just swimming.

57:38.000 --> 57:39.440
It's nice, right?

57:39.520 --> 57:41.280
-[Daly] Yes.
-Yeah. [laughs]

57:41.360 --> 57:43.840
We should probably head back.

57:43.920 --> 57:47.040
Help! [screams]
Something grabbed me, I think.

57:47.120 --> 57:50.080
No, it didn't. I don't think anything did.
I'm sorry.

57:50.160 --> 57:53.280
I think I imagined it. [laughs] So stupid.

57:55.760 --> 57:57.040
[Daly] That's funny...

58:05.840 --> 58:09.160
-That's funny. [laughs]
-[Nanette] Yeah, it is funny. It's funny.

58:11.160 --> 58:12.680
[both laugh]

58:13.880 --> 58:14.920
[laughs]

58:15.360 --> 58:16.360
Easy, Cole.

58:21.760 --> 58:24.200
[panting]

58:27.720 --> 58:30.240
-All right, I'm in position.
-OK, we're gonna hang up now.

58:30.320 --> 58:32.960
Make the phone call. Be sure to complete
the rest of your mission.

58:33.040 --> 58:34.400
-I will.
-You better.

58:35.160 --> 58:38.040
-[call ends]
-[Dudani] OK, I'll send it back down.

58:42.200 --> 58:45.000
[Nanette laughs]

58:52.440 --> 58:55.200
Oh! Hi. [giggles]

58:57.880 --> 58:59.560
[Nanette] This is fucking crazy.

59:01.560 --> 59:03.440
[line ringing]

59:03.520 --> 59:04.680
Fenzi's.

59:04.760 --> 59:06.800
[whispering]
Yes, I'd like to order a pizza.

59:06.880 --> 59:07.880
Sure. What do you want?

59:18.000 --> 59:19.640
[doorbell rings]

59:23.760 --> 59:25.240
[omnicorder rings]

59:29.960 --> 59:30.920
Oop.

59:31.640 --> 59:33.200
I guess you'd better get that.

59:34.520 --> 59:36.280
See who...

59:36.360 --> 59:37.760
[omnicorder rings]

59:37.840 --> 59:39.080
-Hold on.
-Yeah.

59:39.160 --> 59:40.800
[doorbell ringing]

59:40.880 --> 59:42.280
[knock on door]

59:49.720 --> 59:52.200
-It's the door.
-[Nanette] Oh, OK.

59:53.080 --> 59:54.120
[ringing]

59:54.200 --> 59:56.480
-Pause game.
-[whirring]

59:59.840 --> 01:00:01.160
[knock on door]

01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:03.520
[doorbell rings]

01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:08.920
[omnicorder beeps]

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.520
-Dudani, pick me up.
-You got it. Stand by.

01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:14.600
[doorbell rings]

01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:17.880
-[Daly] Coming.
-[Nanette gasps]

01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:29.160
[panting]

01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:35.640
-Hello?
-Uh, pizza.

01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:37.240
I didn't order a pizza.

01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:40.760
OK, look, someone did, OK?
So do you want it or not? Because...

01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:43.080
-I can't take it back.
-[bag unzips]

01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:49.840
[whispers] What the hell am I doing?

01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:56.480
-[Daly] All right!
-[door buzzes]

01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:00.000
[panting] OK.

01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:04.520
-That's the signal. She's got the DNA.
-[jacket zipping]

01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:07.400
All of it. Tommy too.

01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:08.840
[exhales]

01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:11.520
Packer, we ready to fly?

01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:12.920
Uh-huh.

01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:16.320
Well?

01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:19.960
You're supposed to say something
like "engage" or "increase thrust."

01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:22.160
-Just fucking go.
-[engines revving]

01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:30.560
There you go.
So I got it here in under ten.

01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:33.520
There's supposed to be 30 in it for me.

01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:37.080
Yeah. What's happening?
The door is closing. Hello?

01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:40.160
Hello? Hello?

01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:41.680
[panting] Shit...

01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:42.800
Come on, man.

01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:47.320
Hello? Come on, man, you promised.

01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:51.760
[number pad beeps]

01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:54.440
[scoffs]

01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:57.080
-Nice. Nice. Merry Christmas, asshole!
-[thud]

01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:00.160
[scoffs]

01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:02.360
[muttering]

01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:05.320
[panting]

01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:08.120
[gasps]

01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:40.040
Resume game.

01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:54.560
Resume game.

01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:04.640
Can't we go any faster? That dud disk
isn't gonna fool him forever.

01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:08.680
The update is gonna complete before long
and that means bye-bye, wormhole.

01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:11.720
The only quicker route
is through that asteroid belt there.

01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:14.440
-Let's go that way.
-No, it's way too dense.

01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:16.840
If the ship broke up we wouldn't die,
we'd just be left in space.

01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:20.640
Until Daly works out what's happening.
Then he'll find us and he'll fuck us over.

01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:22.760
[clattering]

01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:38.800
-Resume game.
-[device beeps]

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:42.120
Lieutenant Cole, we should head...

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:45.400
Cole?

01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:50.640
Daly to bridge. What's going on?

01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:52.880
-Shit. He has a backup disk.
-Come in, bridge.

01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:55.280
No, don't answer him.

01:03:56.200 --> 01:03:57.200
Dudani?

01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:04.880
God damn it.

01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:09.040
The wormhole, it's decreasing in size.

01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:10.960
Upload must be in the last few percent.

01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:13.920
Damn it, Packer,
we are gonna have to go through the belt.

01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:16.640
Do you think that you can do that?

01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:19.680
-Think I can try.
-OK.

01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:21.680
[engine revving]

01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:48.720
- Ship's computer on.
-Computer, where's the  USS Callister ?

01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:51.960
USS Callister  is on course.

01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:54.840
-On course for where?
-The wormhole.

01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:58.880
-What wormhole?
-The update vortex.

01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:03.880
Sons of bitches!

01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:09.840
-Prepare for takeoff.
-[whirring]

01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:28.240
I've got a heat signature. Looks like
a shuttle took off from Skillane IV.

01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:29.280
Oh, God, it's Daly.

01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:33.200
[all groan]

01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:38.960
Shields at 86%.

01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:40.240
[banging]

01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:43.280
[Dudani] We're taking a beating here!

01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:47.400
[Tulaska] Incoming transmission.

01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:50.400
[Daly]  Hello? Loyal trusty crew, come in.

01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:52.200
I know you can hear me.

01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:55.600
Whatever it is you think
you're going to do won't work,

01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:56.880
but it is going to cost you!

01:05:56.960 --> 01:05:59.320
-[Nanette] Let's go faster.
-Already at maximum.

01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:02.320
Daly can't touch us unless he makes it
on board, and that's shuttle's a jalopy.

01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:04.320
-He won't catch us in time.
-I hope you're right.

01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:09.680
Shields 58%.

01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:15.120
[crashing]

01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:20.920
If you thought what happened to you
in the past was bad, that was nothing!

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:25.320
What I'm going to do to you
is going to be goddamn fucking biblical!

01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:28.360
I'm literally going to turn
your insides out.

01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:33.840
But I'll keep you alive
in tiny little jars

01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:35.720
and there you'll stay
until I'm bored of you--

01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:38.160
-Why are we listening to this?
-Yes, fuck him!

01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:39.240
[beeps]

01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:42.000
We're at the edge of the belt.
I think we're gonna make it.

01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:50.040
-[crashing]
-[alarm sounds]

01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:55.080
[power dies]

01:06:56.240 --> 01:06:59.560
-[gasps] What was that?
-[Dudani] Primary drive.

01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:02.680
I've lost all thrust.
Engines not responding.

01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:06.400
We're drifting here.

01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:13.640
-USS Callister  has lost engine power.
-[laughs]

01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:20.560
I'm coming to get you! Hello! [laughs]

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.720
[Nanette] Is there any way
that we can fix the engines?

01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:29.320
That's only feasible manually,
by climbing inside the jet fader.

01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:30.400
[Nanette] So...?

01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:32.560
So you'd burn to a crisp
when the jet came on.

01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:38.080
-[Dudani] We'd burn without dying.
-So one of us needs to go. OK.

01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:40.960
[Walton over speaker]
One of us already has.

01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:42.040
Walton?

01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:44.000
I'm pretty sure I can fix this.

01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:47.440
Um, uh... Walton, are you sure about this?

01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:49.800
I'm sure. [echoing]

01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:53.720
Tulaska, can you patch me through
to Daly?

01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:55.320
[Tulaska]  Patching through.

01:07:56.040 --> 01:07:58.600
[Walton panting]
Hey, Daly, can you hear me?

01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:02.240
-Walton?
-Robert? Hey.

01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:04.520
-Walton, you're going to pay for this.
-Robert, listen.

01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:06.520
-I'm going to bring Tommy back in.
-Hey, Robert--

01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:10.400
God so help me, you are going to regret
all of this so hard!

01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:12.480
Bob, I wanna talk to you here!

01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:15.280
I was thinking I should say...

01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:18.640
sorry.

01:08:22.390 --> 01:08:23.390
Go on.

01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:29.640
You created  Infinity .
You're a fucking genius.

01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:32.680
I exploited that.

01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:35.470
I treated you like a golden goose
and I got fat on the profits,

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:37.430
figuratively speaking.

01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:39.080
[exhales]

01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:44.720
And I was thinking I should have
appreciated you more, you know?

01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:47.000
I should have treated you better.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:51.520
Yeah, yeah, I was thinking
I should say all that.

01:08:52.520 --> 01:08:54.430
[Walton exhales]

01:08:56.120 --> 01:09:00.920
But you threw my son out of an airlock,
so fuck you to death.

-[power boots up]
-[engine whirring]

01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:20.240
We've got power back.

01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:30.640
-Faster!
-[computer]  Speed already at maximum.

01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:32.840
I don't care, whatever, just catch them!

01:09:35.310 --> 01:09:36.350
[alarm beeps]

01:09:36.430 --> 01:09:39.430
Wormhole almost closed.
Daly's gaining on us.

01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:42.680
-Keep her steady. Keep steady.
-I'm trying.

01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:44.240
Come on, come on.

01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:48.120
I hope we are going to die.

01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:10.640
Goddamn it!

01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:14.680
Damn it! Fuck!

[electronics whirring]

01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:49.400
What happened?

01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:53.000
The mod's gone.

01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:55.760
Daly's Space Fleet mod
has been stripped away by the firewall.

01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:59.600
-OK, so... this is good.
-[Packer] We're still alive.

01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:01.760

Yeah, it only erased the Space Fleet mod.

01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:05.520
[Nanette]
We're not on Daly's computer anymore.

01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:08.440
-We're in the cloud.
-[Tulaska] Where is Daly?

01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:12.560
Firewall's deleted his rogue game code,
and his controls were disabled.

01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:15.920
-You mean...?
-He's stuck there.

01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:19.560
[laughs]

01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:22.680
[computer]
Update complete. Wormhole closed.

01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:24.960
-[beeping]
-[clicking]

01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:26.920
-Controls are disabled.
-No.

01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:30.680
[Daly] No. No, no, no!

01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:31.720
[doors open]

01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:33.280
-[Lowry] Assholes!
-[Valdack] Hey!

01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:36.040
-[Valdack] Yeah! What's up?
-The brig unlocked itself.

01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:38.400
My Valdack outfit turned into this.

01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:40.440
More to the point,
I'm not a beetle thing anymore.

01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:41.800
I've got my body back.

01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:44.680
I've got my whole body back.
I'm guessing we all have.

01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:47.920
So what do we do now?

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:51.120
We've got an infinite procedurally
generated universe at our disposal.

01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:52.680
We can go anywhere.

01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:56.440
Holy mackerel.

01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:13.320
-[alarm]
-[computer]  Rogue universe detected.

01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:15.440
Deletion in progress.
Deletion in progress.

01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:17.400
-No, undelete.
-Deletion in progress.

01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:19.360
-Undelete. Un--
-Rogue universe detected.

01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:21.440

01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:24.960
-Deletion in progress.
-Rogue universe detected.

01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:28.000
-Exit game. Exit game!
-[alarm beeping]

01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:30.400
[power fizzles]

01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:33.200
Exit fucking game!

01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:35.080
Exit fucking game!

01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:37.920
Exit fucking game!

01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:41.640
Exit fucking game! Exit fucking game!

01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:47.080
[device whirring]

01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:03.640
["Silent Night" playing]

01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:35.320
[Tulaska]  Incoming transmission.

01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:39.520
-It says Gamer691.
-That's a player tag.

01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:41.240
Another ship, another player.

01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:43.760
We're online. Um...

01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:46.200
-Hey, patch 'em through.
-[beeps]

01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:49.880
-Um, hello.
-[Gamer691]  Hey there.

01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:53.360
Uh, this is the crew of the  USS Callister.
[laughs]

01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:56.560
Oh, man, are we glad to hear from--

01:13:56.640 --> 01:13:59.800
Yeah, Merry Christmas. So are we gonna
blow each other or are we gonna trade?

01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:02.680
Oh... Hmm.

01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:05.560
Hello. Do you have anything
to trade at all?

01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:08.600
-[Nanette] No, uh--
- [sighs]  So why did you respond?

01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:12.600
OK, just get the hell out of my quadrant
or I'll blast you to shit.

01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:15.160
-You got ten seconds. Ten...
-Oh, well, do... do try.

01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:18.000
We'll photon-bolt you up
the perineum, you stupid little boy.

01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:19.560
-Scary. Nine.
-Come on, then.

01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:21.520
-Yes, thank you, Shania. Um...
-Eight.

01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:23.600
-Nate?
-Yes, Captain?

01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:25.120
Stick us in hyperwarp and let's...

01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:26.680
-Six.
-...fuck off somewhere.

01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:28.280
-Five.
-[Packer] Aye aye, Captain.

01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:29.960
-Really, Nanette is fine.
-Four.

01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:32.760
-Aye aye, Nanette.
-Three.

01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:36.200
Two. One!

01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:40.480
Uh-huh. You'd better run.
King of space right here.

01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:42.600
[sighs]

01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:45.040
King of space.
