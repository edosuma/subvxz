00:30.899 --> 00:32.622
Stop, demon!

00:32.942 --> 00:35.077
Get back here,
I say.

00:35.739 --> 00:38.100
Ha ha! Nowhere to run.

00:38.177 --> 00:41.956
I, the great and powerful
Urgence Evergreen,

00:42.033 --> 00:45.688
command you
to freeze into a million pieces

00:45.765 --> 00:48.600
and leave young Gunther alone!

00:49.418 --> 00:53.316
Foolish demon.
You leave me no choice.

00:53.393 --> 00:56.623
"Zap, zap, zap, zap, zap!"
What?

00:56.893 --> 00:58.124
No, Nina.

00:58.201 --> 01:00.617
You're supposed to be frozen.

01:00.694 --> 01:02.264
Nina!

01:04.887 --> 01:06.618
Nina, the portals!

01:06.695 --> 01:08.546
The elementals are gathering!

01:08.623 --> 01:10.512
Come on,
you blockhead.

01:20.245 --> 01:23.444
I just think we should
discuss this, Evergreen.

01:23.521 --> 01:26.433
Discuss?
Are you listening, Chatsberry?

01:26.510 --> 01:28.991
When this comet hits,
everybody dies...

01:29.068 --> 01:31.469
not just everybody
but us, but <i> us.</i>

01:31.546 --> 01:33.561
Now, now, hold on, Evergreen.

01:33.652 --> 01:36.751
Hath not a comet impacted
our world every thousand years

01:36.828 --> 01:38.679
with no lasting grievousness?

01:38.756 --> 01:43.037
Ah, but this, Balthus, is
no ordinary comet. Behold!

01:44.659 --> 01:46.717
See how it writhes?

01:46.794 --> 01:48.883
It aches for our extinction.

01:48.960 --> 01:50.271
- If...
- But, Evergreen,

01:50.348 --> 01:53.205
even if the comet is
as dangerous as you say,

01:53.282 --> 01:55.453
what can <i> we</i> possibly do?

01:55.530 --> 01:58.443
- We build a crown.
- A crown?

01:58.520 --> 02:01.564
Like none seen before or ever after...

02:01.641 --> 02:04.965
a magical crown whose phantasmal circuitry

02:05.042 --> 02:07.168
will bond to its first bearer

02:07.245 --> 02:10.405
and grant him his one deepest wish...

02:10.482 --> 02:13.451
To destroy the hideous comet
which threatens our world.

02:13.562 --> 02:16.300
The good news is I already built the crown.

02:16.377 --> 02:18.788
The bad news, it needs a power source...

02:18.865 --> 02:22.227
the enchanted Ruby eyes of
the ancient lava dog, Magwood!

02:22.304 --> 02:24.996
- And that's where you come in.
- Wait, wait.

02:25.073 --> 02:26.594
Evergreen, please.

02:26.671 --> 02:29.626
Wish-magic is really the real deal.

02:29.703 --> 02:33.123
This wish may see things in
you you cannot see yourself.

02:33.200 --> 02:37.230
Can you truly say you know
your heart's truest desire?

02:37.307 --> 02:38.676
I'm with Chatsberry.

02:38.753 --> 02:41.984
If this comet hits, we
four indeed may perish,

02:42.061 --> 02:43.708
but the elements we embody...

02:43.785 --> 02:47.121
fire, ice, candy, and
slime... will live on.

02:47.198 --> 02:50.093
But a misplaced wish could
cause irreversible damage

02:50.170 --> 02:51.971
to the very structure of existence!

02:52.048 --> 02:55.742
Well, that's just great.
What about you, Slimy-D?

02:55.976 --> 02:57.973
<font color=#ffff00>♪ Yo, yo.
My name's Slimy-D, ♪</font>

02:58.050 --> 03:00.403
<font color=#ffff00>- ♪ and I'm here to... ♪</font>
- Slimy-D stands with us.

03:00.480 --> 03:04.333
We reject your plan,
Urgence Evergreen.

03:04.486 --> 03:08.278
Very well, then.
You leave me no choice.

03:16.527 --> 03:18.503
Urgence! Stop!

03:18.743 --> 03:20.589
You'll doom us...

03:20.666 --> 03:22.118
all!

03:22.559 --> 03:23.788
Ingrate!

03:25.506 --> 03:28.344
Huh.
Doom you to <i> no</i> doom maybe.

03:28.421 --> 03:30.817
Gunther!
Pack my things, Gunther.

03:30.894 --> 03:32.732
We ride forthwith
for Mount Magwood.

03:32.809 --> 03:35.003
You get to watch me
save the world.

03:35.795 --> 03:36.803
Gunther!

03:36.908 --> 03:38.776
Come on, Gunther.
Get your head in the game.

03:38.853 --> 03:40.963
Sorry, Master Evergreen.

03:42.218 --> 03:45.337
And he expects me to teach
him the ways of magic?

03:45.414 --> 03:46.739
As if.

03:58.804 --> 04:00.891
Ouch! Ouch!

04:01.452 --> 04:04.458
Ouch! Uh, Master Evergreen,

04:04.535 --> 04:08.141
can I ride on the palanquin
with you? My feet are soft.

04:09.389 --> 04:11.894
No, you're right. Whoa!

04:13.189 --> 04:15.072
Ooh, boy.

04:22.063 --> 04:25.910
Gettin' fat.
Gettin' fat, right?

04:25.987 --> 04:29.101
- Mm-hmm.
- However, I would suggest

04:29.178 --> 04:32.755
that this is still 
a nice night. It's quiet.

04:32.832 --> 04:35.644
Mm, it is quiet. Why don't
you put on some music.

04:35.721 --> 04:38.461
- The chimes, Gunther.
- Okay.

04:49.336 --> 04:52.318
Gunther! I said chimes!

04:52.395 --> 04:54.679
- Gunther, no!
- Aah, aah!

04:54.756 --> 04:56.675
Sorry, Master.
I'll put him back.

04:56.752 --> 05:00.467
He-e-e-e-e-e-y.
Mm. What?

05:00.544 --> 05:02.970
Aw, never mind.

05:03.502 --> 05:04.682
Here.

05:04.889 --> 05:07.802
Take the jar
and find me some water.

05:07.879 --> 05:11.139
There's not enough moisture in the
air for me to make us an ice camp.

05:11.282 --> 05:12.560
Uh, Master?

05:12.637 --> 05:16.303
I'm sorry... I don't think I've
seen any water at all today.

05:16.380 --> 05:19.063
Just do it.
Don't anger daddy.

05:19.467 --> 05:22.315
Wait. Are you my father?

05:22.392 --> 05:25.852
No, but I stole your egg and
mutated your brain. Get going.

05:26.557 --> 05:28.030
Mm.

05:28.926 --> 05:29.981
Heh.

05:30.058 --> 05:33.671
You don't know
where you're going, do you, girl?

05:35.293 --> 05:37.559
Aw, you're good at this.

05:37.636 --> 05:39.836
Man, you know who I like?

05:39.980 --> 05:43.390
Master Evergreen. He could do anything!

05:43.600 --> 05:45.043
One thing he's gonna do...

05:45.120 --> 05:48.764
he said he's gonna teach
me magic. I can be like him!

05:49.048 --> 05:50.048
Ugh.

05:57.150 --> 05:58.249
Nina, no!

05:58.326 --> 05:59.658
Aah!

06:03.919 --> 06:05.539
Master Evergreen.

06:05.616 --> 06:08.782
I found the water so
you could build a... oh.

06:09.341 --> 06:12.244
I guess he also found water, too.

06:14.763 --> 06:17.440
He-e-e-e-e-e-y.

06:39.984 --> 06:41.637
Now, Gunther, listen to me.

06:41.714 --> 06:45.404
Don't follow me into Magwood's lair,
or else he'll melt your dome.

06:45.481 --> 06:46.780
Yeah.

06:49.639 --> 06:54.121
Oh, Gunther!
You should see this!

06:54.198 --> 06:55.337
Okay.

06:55.846 --> 06:58.602
Gunther, no. You failed.
He'll melt your dome.

07:05.789 --> 07:09.005
Not as grand
as you once were, eh?

07:18.829 --> 07:21.528
Master Evergreen, I'm sorry,
but I got worried.

07:21.605 --> 07:23.656
Eeeeeeee!

07:35.415 --> 07:38.835
Ohh, boy. Um, maybe, maybe, maybe...

07:38.912 --> 07:43.866
Maybe I <i> can</i> do
magic... like Master Evergreen.

07:44.028 --> 07:46.037
Buh-ice!

07:46.301 --> 07:48.318
Blah. Sorry.

07:51.051 --> 07:53.854
Shh!
That's what you get.

07:54.292 --> 07:56.952
Aaaaaaaaaahh!

08:02.063 --> 08:04.476
Buh-ice!

08:12.780 --> 08:15.890
This is why
I don't teach you magic.

08:18.966 --> 08:25.293
- Nina, Keena, Peena, Preena...
- Gunther!

08:25.370 --> 08:28.493
What the heck are you doing?
Get in here! Gunther!

08:29.381 --> 08:31.484
Ah, there you are,
you blockhead.

08:31.561 --> 08:34.270
Quickly, take your position.
We have precious little time.

08:34.347 --> 08:35.975
Once I complete the bonding chant,

08:36.052 --> 08:37.804
you deactivate the force field.

08:39.626 --> 08:43.234
Bonding, bonding, three, two, one.
You can do it, you can do it.

08:43.311 --> 08:45.814
Three, two, one.
Bonding, bonding.

08:48.193 --> 08:50.255
I did it. I...

08:54.220 --> 08:55.976
Oh.

08:57.717 --> 09:00.157
Aaaaaaaahh!
Come on, now.

09:00.234 --> 09:02.021
What I ever do to you?
Aah!

09:04.274 --> 09:06.057
Watch the column, stupid!

09:06.134 --> 09:07.448
Whoops!

09:08.847 --> 09:10.085
Easy now.

09:14.643 --> 09:17.530
Oh, wow.
Did you see th... ohh!

09:17.607 --> 09:19.420
Ow! My front bone!

09:24.080 --> 09:26.436
Gunther.
Gunther, can you hear me?

09:26.595 --> 09:29.699
Aah... yeah, yes, Master Evergreen.

09:29.776 --> 09:31.100
Okay, good. Now,

09:31.177 --> 09:33.138
aiming at the sound of my voice,

09:33.215 --> 09:36.397
throw the crown so it lands
right on top of my head.

09:36.474 --> 09:38.359
I... wait.
What?

09:38.436 --> 09:40.053
No, no, there's no time.

09:40.130 --> 09:42.648
- It must be <i> you,</i> Gunther.
- Me?

09:42.725 --> 09:44.932
Don't worry. It's easy.
Even a mush-head like you

09:45.009 --> 09:46.231
couldn't donk it up too bad.

09:46.308 --> 09:49.123
Just focus on
your deepest, truest wish...

09:49.200 --> 09:51.530
the destruction of the deadly comet...

09:51.607 --> 09:54.196
and the rest
will take care of itself.

09:54.273 --> 09:57.548
My deepest, truest wish.

10:01.685 --> 10:02.911
Gunther, no.

10:02.988 --> 10:04.847
- Gunther, no.
- Gunther? Buddy?

10:04.924 --> 10:06.995
- What are you wishing for down there?
- Gunther, no.

10:07.072 --> 10:11.179
Gunther, no. Gunther, no. Gunther, no.
Gunther, no. Gunther, no.

10:11.256 --> 10:13.326
Gunther, no. Gunther, no.

10:15.452 --> 10:18.248
That... that's the wrong wish.
You've got to snap out of it!

10:18.325 --> 10:20.587
- <i>Gunther, no!</i>
- Use a concentration spell

10:20.664 --> 10:24.495
or... or a basic focusing
charm like I taught you!

10:24.572 --> 10:26.970
I mean,
like I <i> meant</i> to teach you.

10:27.166 --> 10:29.222
- I...
- Gunther, no! Gunther, no!

10:29.299 --> 10:32.726
- Gunther, no! Gunther, no!
- Gunther, no!

10:32.803 --> 10:35.332
Gunther, no! Gunther, no!

10:35.409 --> 10:38.115
Gunther, nooooo!

10:46.175 --> 10:47.255
Mornin'.

10:47.332 --> 10:48.628
Man, what a dream.

10:48.705 --> 10:51.094
Uh, do you guys ever
have that dino-boy dream,

10:51.171 --> 10:53.119
uh, with the asteroi... what?

10:53.583 --> 10:54.584
What?

10:54.661 --> 10:55.699
What is it?

10:55.776 --> 10:57.201
Somethin' in my teeth?

10:57.800 --> 11:00.233
Something in my hair?

11:00.578 --> 11:02.394
Something in my nose?

11:02.690 --> 11:05.005
Something in my... ear?
