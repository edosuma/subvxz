WEBVTT

00:00.107 --> 00:01.862
Previously on Harrow...

00:01.863 --> 00:04.924
I found these. A betting slip
from the racecourse.

00:04.925 --> 00:08.719
He claimed 30K for that 20K
of fentanyl the police seized.

00:08.720 --> 00:10.799
I thought the dead would be easier
to work with.

00:10.800 --> 00:13.399
So, you think, coming to pathology,
you've made an error of judgement?

00:13.400 --> 00:16.359
I don't know.
But I've met a good dancer.

00:16.360 --> 00:18.879
Do you really believe
Brendan Skene shot you?

00:18.880 --> 00:21.839
Could I ask you a couple of
questions about your ex-husband?

00:21.840 --> 00:23.839
Brendan Skene
sent a lot of letters home.

00:23.840 --> 00:25.479
He had someone write them for him.

00:25.480 --> 00:26.879
You wrote those letters.

00:26.880 --> 00:28.479
But you didn't write all of them,
did you?

00:28.480 --> 00:33.299
Which means Skene had
a new cellmate. Francis Chester.

00:33.400 --> 00:34.999
I know you told me
to mind my own business,

00:35.000 --> 00:37.879
but I've found something out
and it's important.

00:37.880 --> 00:39.608
Call me back, yeah?

What are you doing here?
Getting a coffee.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.559
The only takeaway coffee
in the entire city

02:09.560 --> 02:13.679
happens to be exactly
where I do my morning Tai Chi.

02:13.680 --> 02:16.119
The point of my morning Tai Chi,
Harrow,

02:16.120 --> 02:18.399
is to provide solitude and repose,

02:18.400 --> 02:21.079
to prepare me for a day
of annoyance and grievance.

02:21.080 --> 02:23.679
Why wouldn't you ever tell me
you had a niece?

02:23.680 --> 02:25.159
You came all this way
to ask me that?

02:25.160 --> 02:26.719
And to see your 'snake creeps down'.

02:26.720 --> 02:28.519
That alone was worth
a trip across town.

02:28.520 --> 02:30.279
Alright...
Seriously...

02:30.280 --> 02:31.999
You and I have known each other
for how long?

02:32.000 --> 02:33.919
Too long.
Exactly.

02:33.920 --> 02:35.759
So, why wouldn't you
ever mention a niece

02:35.760 --> 02:37.399
who's a top neurosurgeon?

02:37.400 --> 02:39.279
Well, the same reason
I haven't told you about

02:39.280 --> 02:41.519
my 17th-century ceramics collection.

02:41.520 --> 02:44.639
Because unless it's work,
you're not interested.

02:44.640 --> 02:46.839
The real question...

02:46.840 --> 02:48.319
...is why do want to know?

02:48.320 --> 02:51.439
Look, she's smart, really smart.

02:51.440 --> 02:54.039
She was on her way to becoming
the top in her field.

02:54.040 --> 02:56.039
Why would she leave?

02:56.040 --> 02:58.559
Uh, what's the big secret?
You'll have to ask her.

02:58.560 --> 03:00.599
Well, I'm asking you.
Well, I'm not telling you.

03:00.600 --> 03:02.959
Ah... Couldn't have been
professional misconduct.

03:02.960 --> 03:04.688
Oh...

03:05.600 --> 03:06.759
Pavich.

03:06.760 --> 03:08.279
I'm not even sure
why you're even interested.

03:08.280 --> 03:10.839
But I hope it's just idle curiosity

03:10.840 --> 03:12.439
and nothing more than that.

03:12.440 --> 03:13.960
Pavich.

03:45.880 --> 03:47.479
What's going on?

03:47.480 --> 03:51.299
It's, uh... it's very bad news,
I'm afraid.

03:52.280 --> 03:55.099
You need to prepare yourselves.

05:31.440 --> 05:33.439
Looks like he drowned.

05:33.440 --> 05:37.077
He had his phone
and his wallet with him.

05:37.560 --> 05:39.439
We checked his travel card

05:39.440 --> 05:43.168
and he boarded a ferry
at 7:50 last night.

05:43.760 --> 05:45.320
He never got off.

05:46.440 --> 05:47.986
Now, the tides...

05:48.800 --> 05:51.519
...and the fact the body
washed up here...

05:51.520 --> 05:53.559
...we think he must have fallen off
around 8:00.

05:53.560 --> 05:56.239
Well, how does someone
fall off a ferry?

05:56.240 --> 05:57.719
What was he even doing on a ferry?

05:57.720 --> 06:00.599
OK, when was the last time
anyone saw him?

06:00.600 --> 06:03.159
He, uh... he went home sick

06:03.160 --> 06:04.839
but that was two days ago.

06:04.840 --> 06:06.800
OK.

06:07.960 --> 06:09.480
Harrow?

06:11.120 --> 06:12.759
I, uh...

06:12.760 --> 06:15.039
I just got back
from Port Astor last night.

06:15.040 --> 06:17.495
I meant to call him, but...

06:18.080 --> 06:21.353
...my phone went flat on the flight.

06:23.360 --> 06:25.815
There's a message from him.

06:27.160 --> 06:28.760
Eight o'clock.

06:29.800 --> 06:32.639
That's the time he was on the ferry.

06:32.640 --> 06:34.719
You have
one new voicemail.

06:34.720 --> 06:38.119
New message, 8:01pm.

06:38.120 --> 06:39.359
Hey, it's me.

06:39.360 --> 06:41.359
I know you told me
to mind my own business but...

06:41.360 --> 06:43.879
...I've found something out
and it is really important.

06:43.880 --> 06:46.153
So... call me back, yeah?

06:47.320 --> 06:49.359
What's that about? What did he
want to talk to you about?

06:49.360 --> 06:50.959
I don't know.

06:50.960 --> 06:52.559
You must have some idea.

06:52.560 --> 06:54.919
I don't know!
OK, OK.

06:54.920 --> 06:57.319
We'll look into it from our end.

06:57.320 --> 07:00.839
We'll check security cameras
on the ferry.

07:00.840 --> 07:02.759
But right now,

07:02.760 --> 07:04.519
it looks like accidental drowning -

07:04.520 --> 07:09.157
unless the post-mortem tells us
something different.

07:12.720 --> 07:14.639
Are you sure
it was an accident?

07:14.640 --> 07:16.559
That's what it looks like.

07:16.560 --> 07:18.679
I'm on my way to the morgue now.

07:18.680 --> 07:20.439
Yeah, but, Dad, what if it wasn't?

07:20.440 --> 07:23.439
The police are pretty sure
he drowned.

07:23.440 --> 07:27.119
Well... the police are pretty sure
that I stole that fentanyl.

07:27.120 --> 07:28.719
Look...

07:28.720 --> 07:30.959
...let's just find out how he died.

07:30.960 --> 07:33.879
Then we'll see
what we're dealing with.

07:33.880 --> 07:35.279
OK.
And take care.

07:35.280 --> 07:36.959
Promise me you'll be careful.

07:36.960 --> 07:40.199
And if you see anything wrong,
anything that doesn't make sense,

07:40.200 --> 07:41.639
call me.

07:41.640 --> 07:42.960
I will.

07:46.760 --> 07:48.160
Mum...

07:50.520 --> 07:52.840
Hey...
It's Simon.

07:57.960 --> 08:00.870
Simon's sister - Karina.

08:02.120 --> 08:03.679
He has a sister?

08:03.680 --> 08:05.360
Didn't you know?

08:07.560 --> 08:09.999
Their parents are, uh, flying in

08:10.000 --> 08:13.199
but they won't be here
till tomorrow.

08:13.200 --> 08:14.999
What about David?

08:15.000 --> 08:16.639
Not here...

08:16.640 --> 08:19.095
...under the circumstances.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.959
They split up. Three months ago.

08:22.960 --> 08:24.688
Didn't he tell you?

08:26.120 --> 08:29.484
Simon spoke
so much about you.

08:30.720 --> 08:33.159
I wondered... his death...

08:34.200 --> 08:36.558
...could it be anything
to do with his epilepsy?

08:36.559 --> 08:38.719
Was he recently diagnosed?

08:38.720 --> 08:41.720
No, he had it since he was a kid.

08:41.840 --> 08:45.477
Did you know about this?
Yeah, of course.

08:45.520 --> 08:48.039
Can I see him now?
I'm sorry. Not yet.

08:48.040 --> 08:51.404
We need to complete
the autopsy first.

08:54.800 --> 08:56.319
I saw him.

08:56.320 --> 08:58.800
It was only three days ago.

08:59.920 --> 09:01.999
How can he be...?

09:02.000 --> 09:04.819
We WILL find out what happened.

09:23.840 --> 09:26.559
I don't need to tell you
how important this is.

09:26.560 --> 09:28.160
We miss nothing.

09:29.320 --> 09:31.079
I'd like to do it.
No.

09:31.080 --> 09:33.039
Grace will conduct the autopsy.

09:33.040 --> 09:35.950
Lyle, I'd like you to supervise.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.280
Can we have a word?

09:39.280 --> 09:40.880
Carry on.

09:46.520 --> 09:50.339
Do you think Simon's death
was an accident?

09:51.560 --> 09:53.924
I'm just concerned that...

09:55.200 --> 09:59.039
...given your completely
understandable distress right now,

09:59.040 --> 10:01.079
that you might try and link
Simon's death

10:01.080 --> 10:02.719
to other events in your life.

10:02.720 --> 10:05.359
Are you suggesting that
my post-mortem would be biased?

10:05.360 --> 10:10.079
No. No, no, no. I just don't want
anyone else suggesting it.

10:10.080 --> 10:13.359
Simon's autopsy needs to be
completely impartial.

10:13.360 --> 10:15.399
No perceived conflicts of interest.

10:15.400 --> 10:17.120
We owe him that.

10:51.960 --> 10:53.480
Dr Fairley?

10:55.240 --> 10:58.968
Can you get the CT scan up
for me, please?

10:59.440 --> 11:00.960
Yes, of course.

11:17.120 --> 11:18.640
Are you OK?

11:21.440 --> 11:23.895
I'm more worried about him.

11:24.440 --> 11:26.279
He needs a distraction.

11:26.280 --> 11:27.599
Have you got something?

11:27.600 --> 11:30.873
We had an electrocution
this morning.

11:34.080 --> 11:36.160
Daniel?

11:49.120 --> 11:51.119
We're not sure yet.

11:51.120 --> 11:53.239
Can you tell me again what happened?

11:53.240 --> 11:54.799
I had no idea he was dead.

11:54.800 --> 11:56.599
I just thought it was a blown fuse.

11:56.600 --> 12:00.600
You said all the lights went out
around 9:00?

12:01.000 --> 12:02.520
Dr Harrow.

12:03.520 --> 12:05.884
Turua Parata. Crime scene.

12:06.480 --> 12:08.999
I, uh... I heard about
your colleague.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.819
I'm sorry.
Thank you.

12:11.760 --> 12:13.280
What do we have?

12:19.160 --> 12:21.519
Ross Moran. Unemployed.

12:21.520 --> 12:25.793
Seems a pretty straightforward
accidental death.

12:26.280 --> 12:31.735
We're trying to locate family,
but fingerprints will confirm.

12:36.880 --> 12:39.519
Prison?
Been in and out all his life.

12:39.520 --> 12:41.919
Assault, theft, petty crime.

12:41.920 --> 12:45.011
Mostly around racing and gambling.

12:45.600 --> 12:47.959
The neighbour said
the fuse in her flat blew.

12:47.960 --> 12:51.039
At 9:00, so that gives us
the time of death.

12:51.040 --> 12:52.919
Listening to the races in the bath,

12:52.920 --> 12:54.759
radio falls in - race over.

12:54.760 --> 12:57.306
Hmm. The perils of gambling.

12:58.160 --> 13:01.524
Was there anyone else
in the bathroom?

13:02.360 --> 13:05.439
This dust mark here.

13:05.440 --> 13:08.959
That radio's been sitting there
for months, if not years.

13:08.960 --> 13:12.519
Why would it suddenly
fall off the ledge last night?

13:12.520 --> 13:14.119
Well, maybe he had a winner.

13:14.120 --> 13:16.839
Got excited, kicked his legs
in the air.

13:16.840 --> 13:19.279
And why did he grab the curtain?

13:19.280 --> 13:21.039
Electrocution is instant.

13:21.040 --> 13:23.959
There's no time to grab for anything.

13:23.960 --> 13:26.079
Well, there's no sign
of forced entry.

13:26.080 --> 13:27.639
The doors are locked
from the inside.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.359
The neighbour lives through
that wall

13:29.360 --> 13:31.279
and all she heard
was his radio, so...

13:31.280 --> 13:34.099
Can you dust for prints anyway?

13:34.960 --> 13:37.415
I heard you were like this.

13:37.560 --> 13:39.239
Like what?

13:39.240 --> 13:44.199
Like you get a hunch and, suddenly,
everyone has to do overtime.

13:44.200 --> 13:46.879
Hmm. I'm not sure I'd trust
my hunches right now,

13:46.880 --> 13:49.699
but let's get it dusted anyway.

13:59.920 --> 14:01.479
Burn marks?

14:01.480 --> 14:03.799
Yeah, it's from the rings
he was wearing.

14:03.800 --> 14:06.559
What about that bruising?
That's not from electrocution.

14:06.560 --> 14:08.759
No, that's pre-mortem.

14:08.760 --> 14:11.679
So, he could have had
a fight with someone.

14:11.680 --> 14:13.199
Yes, but not in the bathroom.

14:13.200 --> 14:14.719
For swelling to occur,

14:14.720 --> 14:17.559
this would have happened
some time before he died.

14:17.560 --> 14:19.119
No injuries to the face.

14:19.120 --> 14:20.879
Maybe he's the better fighter.

14:20.880 --> 14:23.599
And the other person
has the facial injuries.

14:23.600 --> 14:26.839
Fingerprints Bureau.
They've run the prints.

14:26.840 --> 14:29.839
OK, all the prints in the bathroom
belong to Mr Moran.

14:29.840 --> 14:32.520
Except...
What?

14:33.520 --> 14:35.679
There was a smudge.
What sort of smudge?

14:35.680 --> 14:37.959
When I took the radio
out of the water and dried it off,

14:37.960 --> 14:40.779
there was a smudge on the back.

14:40.840 --> 14:42.559
Hmm. And you ran lab tests.
What did you find?

14:42.560 --> 14:44.159
Small amounts of talcum,

14:44.160 --> 14:46.559
which could be baby powder or...

14:46.560 --> 14:48.560
From latex gloves.

14:54.080 --> 14:57.519
I'm gonna have to talk to my boss,
see where he wants to take this.

14:57.520 --> 14:59.079
The man was a gambler.

14:59.080 --> 15:01.999
I'd start by trying to find out
who he owes money to.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.559
Hmm.

15:09.480 --> 15:12.119
Taking off the fence
now, Red Fever starting to go

15:12.120 --> 15:15.199
and they're followed further back
by Lord Shabby, Gold Eagle.

15:15.200 --> 15:17.399
As they turn for home and
Lloyd's Luck advances to the lead,

15:17.400 --> 15:20.199
about 400 metres left to go, by
a length and a half, Marobbin Bay.

15:20.200 --> 15:22.599
Fair Dinkum coming home well
down the outside,

15:22.600 --> 15:24.319
followed by Crown Silver.

15:24.320 --> 15:26.319
And Velveeta is starting finish well
at the sprint now.

15:26.320 --> 15:27.759
Lloyd's Luck is tackled
by Marobbin Bay.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.599
Velveeta enjoying another good run.

15:29.600 --> 15:31.999
Lloyd's Luck tackled by Marobbin Bay
down the outside.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.759
Go! Go!

15:34.760 --> 15:36.999
Get up!
Go! Go!

15:39.000 --> 15:40.319
Yes! Go!

15:40.320 --> 15:42.359
Yes! Yes!

15:42.360 --> 15:44.319
Marobbin Bay by a long head
to Lloyd's Luck,

15:44.320 --> 15:46.359
Gold Eagle would be
just behind them,

15:46.360 --> 15:48.079
followed by Velveeta.

15:48.080 --> 15:50.239
And back behind them,
a further gap in the field,

15:50.240 --> 15:51.999
the others were Red Fever,

15:52.000 --> 15:53.759
they were followed by Marine Girl.

15:53.760 --> 15:56.759
Back behind them, Lord Shabby,
Fair Dinkum and Your Highness.

15:56.760 --> 16:00.942
And a long way back...

16:24.440 --> 16:26.804
Nice sutures, Dr Molyneux.

16:28.520 --> 16:30.720
His family will be...

16:32.840 --> 16:36.239
Would you like me to finish up,
Dr Fairley?

16:36.240 --> 16:37.280
Mm.

17:20.200 --> 17:23.109
Anything to contradict drowning?

17:24.720 --> 17:27.266
Do you know how he fell off?

17:27.599 --> 17:30.039
There were flakes of paint
under his fingernails.

17:30.040 --> 17:33.199
We're getting it tested but
it's the same colour as the ferry.

17:33.200 --> 17:34.520
Bruising?

17:35.920 --> 17:39.284
Probably hit the side
on his way over.

17:39.360 --> 17:41.759
And all these other marks
on his body...

17:41.760 --> 17:43.879
They're all consistent with
floating in the river overnight

17:43.880 --> 17:46.517
and getting caught on things.

17:50.880 --> 17:56.608
Is there any suggestion or
possibility anyone else was involved?

17:57.360 --> 17:58.999
Not from what I've found.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.199
We'll wait for tox
to come back, of course,

18:01.200 --> 18:05.564
but the preliminary finding
is death by drowning.

18:18.840 --> 18:21.931
What were you doing on that ferry?

18:24.360 --> 18:26.724
You don't even like boats.

18:31.800 --> 18:34.255
His sister's ready for him.

18:38.520 --> 18:40.359
You should talk to her.

18:40.360 --> 18:42.039
You did the autopsy.

18:42.040 --> 18:46.040
You knew him better.
It should come from you.

19:05.040 --> 19:06.799
May I touch him?

19:06.800 --> 19:08.360
Of course.

19:24.840 --> 19:26.320
Goodbye.

19:29.840 --> 19:31.760
Simon Says.

19:35.160 --> 19:38.251
It was our game when we were kids.

19:38.680 --> 19:41.040
Simon always won.

19:49.840 --> 19:53.560
Thank you for looking after him.

19:56.840 --> 20:01.477
It's so nice he's with the people
he loved the best.

20:09.200 --> 20:11.879
8:01pm.

20:11.880 --> 20:13.319
Hey, it's me.

20:13.320 --> 20:15.319
I know you told me
to mind my own business, but...

20:15.320 --> 20:17.519
...I've found something out
and it is really important.

20:17.520 --> 20:19.840
So... call me back, yeah?

20:20.960 --> 20:23.040
To replay, press 5.

20:24.440 --> 20:26.599
Hey, it's me. I know you
told me to mind my own business...

20:26.600 --> 20:28.119
What are you doing?

20:28.120 --> 20:30.559
You've accessed my autopsy report.

20:30.560 --> 20:33.079
Are you trying to see
if I made a mistake?

20:33.080 --> 20:34.799
I'm trying to understand

20:34.800 --> 20:38.879
how a perfectly healthy 27-year-old
who hates boats falls off a ferry.

20:38.880 --> 20:41.399
Only he wasn't perfectly healthy.

20:41.400 --> 20:42.799
The epilepsy?

20:42.800 --> 20:44.919
It's possible he had a seizure.

20:44.920 --> 20:48.359
Well, that would cause him to fall
to the deck, not out over the rail.

20:48.360 --> 20:50.279
What if he was sitting on the rail?

20:50.280 --> 20:53.159
Anyway, I didn't even know
he had epilepsy.

20:53.160 --> 20:54.919
I find it hard to believe
he'd have an episode

20:54.920 --> 20:56.519
serious enough to kill him.

20:56.520 --> 20:59.359
That's what SUDEP is -
sudden unexpected death...

20:59.360 --> 21:01.633
In epilepsy. Yes, I know.

21:03.560 --> 21:05.599
It just feels wrong somehow.

21:05.600 --> 21:08.159
Unfortunately,
there's no way of knowing

21:08.160 --> 21:12.615
what his brain was doing
in those crucial moments.

21:16.880 --> 21:18.759
No.

21:18.760 --> 21:21.919
But we might be able to find out
what his heart was doing.

21:21.920 --> 21:25.466
The smart watch.
Has anybody checked it?

21:27.080 --> 21:28.279
That's when he died.

21:28.280 --> 21:29.959
8:05pm.

21:29.960 --> 21:32.119
Now, if he'd had a seizure,

21:32.120 --> 21:36.079
we'd be seeing
a little tachycardia right here.

21:36.080 --> 21:39.079
No sign of
elevated heart rate at all.

21:39.080 --> 21:43.959
And there's also no decrease
in heartbeat beforehand.

21:43.960 --> 21:47.719
If he'd had a dizzy spell
caused by low blood pressure,

21:47.720 --> 21:51.175
we should be seeing
the heartbeat slow.

21:51.600 --> 21:54.719
What's this, though - at 8:02?

21:54.720 --> 21:57.280
That's when he called me.

21:58.520 --> 22:01.239
8:01pm.

22:01.240 --> 22:04.239
Hey, it's me. I know you told
me to mind my own business, but...

22:04.240 --> 22:06.719
...I've found something out
and it is really important.

22:06.720 --> 22:08.959
So... call me back, yeah?

22:08.960 --> 22:13.799
He sounds excited. Do you know
what he was talking about?

22:13.800 --> 22:15.519
The police said he boarded the ferry

22:15.520 --> 22:17.640
at 7:50.

22:21.360 --> 22:22.759
Wait.

22:22.760 --> 22:24.519
What's that?

22:24.520 --> 22:27.319
Elevated heart rate
for three minutes,

22:27.320 --> 22:28.839
at 7:30.

22:28.840 --> 22:31.119
We need to find out where he was

22:31.120 --> 22:32.679
right there.

22:32.680 --> 22:35.479
Well, all we know is he got off
at Duralong Point at 6:30

22:35.480 --> 22:37.879
and reboarded at 7:50.

22:37.880 --> 22:41.279
Do we have anything from the ferry?
Uh, security footage?

22:41.280 --> 22:45.826
No cameras on the boat.
Only the entries and exits.

22:50.240 --> 22:52.160
OK.

22:53.400 --> 22:55.491
That's him getting off.

23:01.480 --> 23:05.117
And that's him
boarding the return ferry.

23:12.800 --> 23:14.519
Um, did you find his bag?

23:14.520 --> 23:17.039
It must have
gone overboard with him.

23:17.040 --> 23:19.950
It'll be somewhere in the river.

23:20.360 --> 23:23.879
So, something happened
in that hour and 20 minutes

23:23.880 --> 23:26.335
while he was off the ferry.

23:26.760 --> 23:29.919
What's at Duralong Point?
It's an old wharfie suburb.

23:29.920 --> 23:31.239
Working-class.

23:31.240 --> 23:32.839
It's pretty run-down there.

23:32.840 --> 23:35.113
Why would Simon be there?

23:37.000 --> 23:40.000
And do we have his phone records?

23:47.280 --> 23:49.759
Do we know where he was
at Duralong Point?

23:49.760 --> 23:51.599
There's only one tower in the area,

23:51.600 --> 23:54.559
so he could be anywhere here.

23:54.560 --> 23:56.239
It's a pretty big footprint.

23:56.240 --> 24:02.331
But, uh, what is the connection
between where he went and his death?

24:02.760 --> 24:05.639
We are still talking
accidental drowning, right?

24:05.640 --> 24:07.040
Yes.

24:09.960 --> 24:11.879
Do you disagree?

24:11.880 --> 24:14.200
It's not my autopsy.

24:15.440 --> 24:18.531
Thanks for backing me up in there.

24:18.600 --> 24:20.439
Are you disputing my findings?

24:20.440 --> 24:22.959
I'm not disputing cause of death.

24:22.960 --> 24:25.679
But don't you want to know
why Simon was on that ferry

24:25.680 --> 24:27.079
and what caused him to fall off?

24:27.080 --> 24:28.839
Did you pinch the phone records?

24:28.840 --> 24:32.119
I need to know what he was doing
at that ferry stop.

24:32.120 --> 24:34.119
How is that relevant to how he died?

24:34.120 --> 24:37.119
Well, we won't know
until we get there.

24:37.120 --> 24:38.839
Whatever you're looking for,
you think

24:38.840 --> 24:43.439
that if you'd have done the autopsy
yourself, you'd have found it.

24:43.440 --> 24:46.279
I just need to know what he was doing

24:46.280 --> 24:48.879
all the way out at a place
that I've never heard him mention.

24:48.880 --> 24:50.239
Well, it seems pretty clear

24:50.240 --> 24:52.119
you didn't hear him mention
lots of things.

24:52.120 --> 24:54.399
And it's only now -
now he's on my autopsy table -

24:54.400 --> 24:55.959
that you're starting to
pay attention.

24:55.960 --> 24:58.039
Well, newsflash -
he's not your patient.

24:58.040 --> 25:03.313
So, whatever it is you find,
it's not gonna bring him back.

25:03.800 --> 25:06.528
I hope you find what you need.

26:38.920 --> 26:40.375
Alright. Thanks.

26:48.840 --> 26:50.759
I'm from the Coroner's Office.

26:50.760 --> 26:53.760
Were you working here last night?

26:54.800 --> 26:58.164
I'm looking for a friend
who was here.

27:02.640 --> 27:05.822
Yeah, well, it was busy last night.

27:07.960 --> 27:09.479
Hmm.

27:09.480 --> 27:12.390
Can I have one of those, please?

27:13.440 --> 27:14.600
Five bucks.

27:32.920 --> 27:36.648
I see it's Ross Moran's turn
this weekend.

27:38.320 --> 27:40.919
I'm afraid he won't be
laying any bets.

27:40.920 --> 27:42.840
He died last night.

27:43.960 --> 27:45.799
What? How?

27:45.800 --> 27:48.528
Still trying to work that out.

27:49.720 --> 27:50.880
Alright.

27:51.880 --> 27:53.639
That kid was here.

27:53.640 --> 27:56.159
He came in looking for Ross,
they went out the back

27:56.160 --> 27:58.888
and they had a bit of a fight.

28:06.480 --> 28:08.571
Do you know what about?

28:09.160 --> 28:10.639
Is there any footage,
security cameras?

28:10.640 --> 28:12.879
No. But it wasn't a big thing.

28:12.880 --> 28:16.199
Ross just told him to piss off,
I think, and... he did.

28:16.200 --> 28:17.559
What about Ross?

28:17.560 --> 28:20.833
He came back in
and had another beer.

28:22.520 --> 28:26.599
Look, we can't find a single thing
to connect Simon with Ross Moran.

28:26.600 --> 28:28.559
There's no evidence
of any previous contact.

28:28.560 --> 28:31.119
There's no phone records of
the two of them calling each other.

28:31.120 --> 28:33.279
None of the neighbours
have ever even seen Simon.

28:33.280 --> 28:37.559
And, yet, Simon turns up to the bar,
asks for Moran.

28:37.560 --> 28:39.599
They have a fight, Simon leaves.

28:39.600 --> 28:41.799
Moran finishes his beer - he leaves.

28:41.800 --> 28:44.119
And within 90 minutes,
they're both dead.

28:44.120 --> 28:46.159
They can't possibly
have killed each other.

28:46.160 --> 28:48.479
What are you saying?

28:48.480 --> 28:49.919
I don't know.

28:49.920 --> 28:53.039
Grace's report
said accidental drowning.

28:53.040 --> 28:56.759
Your preliminary report on Moran
said accidental electrocution.

28:56.760 --> 28:59.239
Yes, but what about
that talcum smudge on the radio?

28:59.240 --> 29:02.199
If that came from a latex glove, that
puts someone else in the bathroom.

29:02.200 --> 29:05.399
It's not enough to pursue
a homicide investigation -

29:05.400 --> 29:07.399
not with no other evidence
to support it.

29:07.400 --> 29:10.673
Their deaths
have to be coincidental.

29:24.360 --> 29:26.279
Harrow?

29:26.280 --> 29:29.371
What do you think's going on here?

29:29.600 --> 29:30.782
I don't know.

29:32.080 --> 29:34.559
Look, Maxine is probably right.

29:34.560 --> 29:37.719
They died miles apart,
at different times.

29:37.720 --> 29:39.993
Both look like accidents.

29:41.320 --> 29:43.957
But why was Simon even there?

29:44.440 --> 29:46.622
What was he looking for?

29:47.280 --> 29:51.099
What was he trying to tell me
when he rang?

29:51.440 --> 29:56.039
Do you think Simon's death is
somehow connected to your shooting?

29:56.040 --> 29:58.239
And Fern?

29:58.240 --> 30:00.399
And the Fiat and the rest of it?

30:00.400 --> 30:02.199
If I said that,

30:02.200 --> 30:05.019
you'd accuse me of being crazy.

30:05.200 --> 30:08.019
Well, I'm hoping you are, mate.

30:08.760 --> 30:13.124
Because otherwise,
what are we dealing with here?

30:14.120 --> 30:17.393
I don't think Brendan Skene shot me.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.440
Who did?

30:23.040 --> 30:25.720
A man called Francis Chester.

30:27.120 --> 30:30.484
But, unfortunately, he couldn't have.

30:31.720 --> 30:34.630
'Cause he's inconveniently dead.

30:40.520 --> 30:43.399
You have
one saved message.

30:43.400 --> 30:46.999
Message received 8:01pm.

30:47.000 --> 30:50.759
Hey, it's me. I know you told
me to mind my own business but...

30:50.760 --> 30:53.039
...I've found something out
and it is really important.

30:53.040 --> 30:55.313
So... call me back, yeah?

30:56.200 --> 30:58.559
To replay, press 5.

30:58.560 --> 31:01.119
To transfer, press 4.

31:01.120 --> 31:02.599
To do...

31:02.600 --> 31:04.839
Hey, it's me. I know you told
me to mind my own business but...

31:04.840 --> 31:06.119
Hey.

31:06.120 --> 31:08.399
...I've found something out
and it is really important...

31:08.400 --> 31:09.520
You OK?

31:15.600 --> 31:17.360
Simon.

31:27.160 --> 31:31.199
I'm surprised...
you're here, actually.

31:31.200 --> 31:33.839
I thought you'd be at work or...

31:33.840 --> 31:38.639
...trying to prove that Simon's death
wasn't an accident.

31:38.640 --> 31:42.959
Fern told me you think
there might be more to it.

31:42.960 --> 31:44.519
I don't know.

31:44.520 --> 31:49.430
He was out there, doing something.
I have no idea what.

31:49.600 --> 31:51.399
How is Fern?

31:51.400 --> 31:53.399
I don't know.

31:53.400 --> 31:55.999
She's been out all day,
doing something.

31:56.000 --> 31:57.819
I have no idea what.

32:01.240 --> 32:02.759
To be honest,

32:02.760 --> 32:05.488
I'm worried about both of you.

32:06.560 --> 32:08.279
I'm fine.
No, you're not.

32:08.280 --> 32:11.917
You haven't been fine
since you got shot.

32:12.240 --> 32:13.720
I know you.

32:16.560 --> 32:18.999
When bad stuff happens,
you chase answers,

32:19.000 --> 32:20.879
but sometimes, you get
so obsessed with the dead,

32:20.880 --> 32:23.426
you forget about the living.

32:25.840 --> 32:28.022
Your daughter needs you.

32:28.480 --> 32:31.753
She doesn't need you chasing ghosts.

33:05.960 --> 33:08.960
Hey. What's taken so long?

33:10.680 --> 33:13.039
What are you doing here?

33:13.040 --> 33:17.313
What are you talking about?
We're going to work.

33:19.080 --> 33:20.879
Uh... jeez.

33:20.880 --> 33:23.971
You'd think I'd died or something.

33:28.720 --> 33:29.759
Ow!

33:29.760 --> 33:31.879
Why are you being so weird?

33:31.880 --> 33:33.279
Oh, my God...

33:33.280 --> 33:36.319
Oh, my God! I...

33:36.320 --> 33:40.839
I had this crazy dream where
you'd drowned and I didn't know why.

33:40.840 --> 33:44.159
I don't even like water.
I know! Right?

33:44.160 --> 33:46.479
Does this mean you actually cared?

33:46.480 --> 33:50.299
Of course I cared.
Everyone was devastated.

33:51.240 --> 33:52.919
So, so glad to see you.

33:52.920 --> 33:54.919
Maybe I should capitalise
on this brief moment

33:54.920 --> 33:58.466
of whatever's going on
inside your head.

34:00.320 --> 34:01.879
Fine.

34:01.880 --> 34:03.479
Whatever you want. Anything.

34:03.480 --> 34:06.026
Great! You can let ME drive.

34:22.080 --> 34:23.560
What happened?!

34:24.639 --> 34:26.079
What happened to you?!

34:26.080 --> 34:28.199
It's not about 'what', Harrow.
It's about 'why'.

34:28.199 --> 34:29.600
What...?

34:31.960 --> 34:35.559
The watch. We looked at the watch -
where it peaked.

34:35.560 --> 34:37.199
You're missing the point.

34:37.199 --> 34:40.018
It's not about where it peaked.

35:05.920 --> 35:11.011
I'm sorry about this, Simon,
but you know I need to know.

35:21.960 --> 35:26.919
Oh, God... What's so
important at this time of night?

35:26.920 --> 35:28.519
What on earth?!

35:28.520 --> 35:30.279
The heart rate data.

35:30.280 --> 35:33.679
It's not about the peak.
It's about the flatline.

35:33.680 --> 35:35.839
Why didn't it jump
when he was drowning?

35:35.840 --> 35:37.879
Because he was unconscious.

35:37.880 --> 35:39.839
I know this is your autopsy,

35:39.840 --> 35:41.759
but did you check for
unusual chemicals?

35:41.760 --> 35:43.999
Like what?
Like succinylcholine.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.637
Why on earth would I do that?

35:46.760 --> 35:48.239
Can you do that for me?

35:48.240 --> 35:50.320
Can you tell me why?

35:52.240 --> 35:53.879
15 years ago,

35:53.880 --> 35:57.879
Jonathan Scalera was immobilised
with succinylcholine.

35:57.880 --> 35:59.799
A paralytic drug.
I've seen it used in theatre.

35:59.800 --> 36:01.639
His killer was an anaesthetist.

36:01.640 --> 36:04.439
He used to strangle
his female victims

36:04.440 --> 36:06.679
while their boyfriends watched.

36:06.680 --> 36:08.999
Immobilised?
Yes.

36:09.000 --> 36:12.199
I think the same guy killed Simon.

36:12.200 --> 36:17.746
I think he injected him with succs,
then pushed him overboard.

36:33.240 --> 36:36.319
It explains everything
about Simon's heart rate -

36:36.320 --> 36:40.399
the sudden spike, the steady beat,
then the flatline.

36:40.400 --> 36:42.120
Look at his neck.

36:43.200 --> 36:45.639
I noted that puncture in my report.

36:45.640 --> 36:47.399
There's a half-dozen similar ones

36:47.400 --> 36:49.639
from the current dragging him
through stuff on the riverbank.

36:49.640 --> 36:52.039
You don't know
this isn't an injection site.

36:52.040 --> 36:54.319
And you don't know it is.
It's all guesswork.

36:54.320 --> 36:55.959
Unless we find succs.

36:55.960 --> 36:57.319
Succs breaks down in minutes.

36:57.320 --> 36:59.399
But the by-products
are still traceable.

36:59.400 --> 37:01.359
If you're lucky.
Well, then, let's try our luck!

37:01.360 --> 37:02.999
Let's take another sample,
run another test.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.079
No.
It's the only way to be sure!

37:05.080 --> 37:06.879
I AM sure.

37:06.880 --> 37:08.879
I stand by my autopsy

37:08.880 --> 37:11.239
and I'm not reopening Simon's body
at 3:00 in the morning

37:11.240 --> 37:13.479
to send of more tissue
on some crazy hunch.

37:13.480 --> 37:15.879
What - don't you care?!
I CAN'T care!

37:15.880 --> 37:21.517
If I care, then I can't focus
on my job and I make bad choices!

37:25.480 --> 37:27.679
I did my job and I did it well.

37:27.680 --> 37:30.199
If you want to re-examine
Simon's body,

37:30.200 --> 37:35.382
then you get clearance from Maxine
or my other supervisor.

38:18.440 --> 38:20.804
A second autopsy?

38:24.040 --> 38:25.800
That's a good idea.

38:27.280 --> 38:31.826
I should have recused myself
from that post-mortem.

38:32.280 --> 38:34.735
I thought I'd be OK, but...

38:35.160 --> 38:36.999
When you speak to someone
for the last time,

38:37.000 --> 38:39.319
you expect to say something nicer

38:39.320 --> 38:41.679
than, "Get back to work
unless you're ill."

38:41.680 --> 38:43.679
He wasn't ill, though.

38:43.680 --> 38:47.279
Well, not with anything obvious
that we found in the PM.

38:47.280 --> 38:48.800
So, uh...

38:49.960 --> 38:51.919
I thought he was
just trying to skive off.

38:51.920 --> 38:54.466
You know, chasing YOUR tail.

38:54.840 --> 38:56.519
What do you mean?

38:56.520 --> 38:58.759
You know, the shooting business.

38:58.760 --> 39:01.519
That's what he was doing
before he went home.

39:01.520 --> 39:03.079
He was looking at
the body of your shooter.

39:03.080 --> 39:04.959
Skene? Why?

39:04.960 --> 39:06.439
I don't know.

39:06.440 --> 39:10.799
But he logged on to Skene's file
after he left work as well.

39:10.800 --> 39:14.164
Looking for what?
Skene's next of kin.

39:32.520 --> 39:34.199
That's him.

39:34.200 --> 39:38.837
He wanted to know why
I never claimed Brendan's body

39:39.480 --> 39:40.960
Why didn't you?

39:41.960 --> 39:44.519
Look, I did nothing wrong.
The insurance bloke came to ME.

39:44.520 --> 39:47.599
I didn't even know
Brendan had insurance.

39:47.600 --> 39:49.159
Life insurance?

39:49.160 --> 39:51.639
Like I told your mate,
he just turned up with a cheque.

39:51.640 --> 39:53.640
What did he look like?

39:54.800 --> 39:56.800
Like an accountant.

39:59.120 --> 40:01.600
Was it him?
No.

40:02.720 --> 40:05.399
Are you sure?
Listen.

40:05.400 --> 40:07.079
I don't want any trouble.

40:07.080 --> 40:09.159
If this messes with my benefits...

40:09.160 --> 40:11.599
If you want to keep them,
I suggest you tell me

40:11.600 --> 40:13.319
exactly what you told my friend.

40:13.320 --> 40:15.320
Why can't you ask him?

40:24.720 --> 40:26.040
Letters?

40:27.240 --> 40:28.719
From Brendan to your son?

40:28.720 --> 40:30.439
Your mate seemed very excited about

40:30.440 --> 40:33.804
the fact that
someone else wrote them.

40:33.840 --> 40:35.119
Someone else?

40:35.120 --> 40:37.279
'Cause of the fact
Brendan couldn't write.

40:37.280 --> 40:40.479
He was... he was, um...

40:40.480 --> 40:42.079
...you know, dys... dys...

40:42.080 --> 40:43.279
Dyslexic.

40:43.280 --> 40:45.759
Stupid is what he was.
So, who wrote these?

40:45.760 --> 40:47.599
Whoever he was sharing a cell with.

40:47.600 --> 40:49.873
Mostly a guy called Ross.

40:53.640 --> 40:55.240
Ross Moran?

41:03.360 --> 41:06.879
This handwriting's different.
Who wrote these?

41:06.880 --> 41:08.200
He never said.

41:45.000 --> 41:48.639
I know what Simon was doing.
I know what he found.

41:48.640 --> 41:51.399
A link between Brendan Skene,
who claimed he shot me,

41:51.400 --> 41:53.219
and Francis Chester.

41:54.200 --> 41:56.279
They shared a cell together.

41:56.280 --> 41:58.639
Someone called me
after Skene was dead.

41:58.640 --> 42:00.359
It has to have been Chester.

42:00.360 --> 42:02.997
The handwriting is identical.

42:05.360 --> 42:07.679
Look, I... I know you say
that he's dead

42:07.680 --> 42:10.239
but somehow,
Francis Chester is alive.

42:10.240 --> 42:11.359
Daniel...

42:11.360 --> 42:14.799
I'm convinced he killed Simon
and Moran. He is covering his tracks.

42:14.800 --> 42:18.528
Daniel, we know exactly
what killed Simon.

42:25.320 --> 42:26.959
I did what you asked.

42:26.960 --> 42:29.119
I sent more samples away
for testing.

42:29.120 --> 42:31.319
Tox came back.
And?

42:31.320 --> 42:33.684
You found succinylcholine?

42:35.440 --> 42:37.359
Benzhydrylacetamide,

42:37.360 --> 42:40.199
along with increased levels
of dopamine.

42:40.200 --> 42:41.679
Modafinil?

42:41.680 --> 42:44.559
It's one of the smart drugs. It's
supposed to enhance concentration.

42:44.560 --> 42:49.159
And increased resistance to fatigue,
but why was he taking that?

42:49.160 --> 42:51.679
His sister said
he was doing 12-hour days here,

42:51.680 --> 42:55.159
plus his casual hospital work
on the weekends.

42:55.160 --> 42:57.599
And he was also studying for exams.

42:57.600 --> 43:00.639
She said he really
wanted to impress you.

43:00.640 --> 43:04.159
The Modafinil Simon was taking
to stay awake longer

43:04.160 --> 43:07.919
had a negative interaction
with his epilepsy medication.

43:07.920 --> 43:10.439
It seems like that this
brought about a dizzy spell,

43:10.440 --> 43:12.639
which caused him
to fall off the ferry.

43:12.640 --> 43:14.199
I don't believe it.

43:14.200 --> 43:16.719
He wouldn't make a mistake like that.
I know Simon.

43:16.720 --> 43:18.959
You didn't even know
he had epilepsy.

43:18.960 --> 43:20.799
Or a sister.

43:20.800 --> 43:22.999
Listen, I'm really sorry
but Simon died

43:23.000 --> 43:24.599
because he was burning
the candle at both ends.

43:24.600 --> 43:25.719
Why?!

43:25.720 --> 43:28.993
Because he was trying
to be like you!

44:21.480 --> 44:23.160
Dr Harrow?

44:26.280 --> 44:28.199
I found this.

44:28.200 --> 44:30.382
From his locker at work.

44:31.040 --> 44:34.040
I think he'd want you to have it.

44:44.320 --> 44:47.199
"Day one, met my boss,

44:47.200 --> 44:49.120
"Dr Daniel Harrow.

44:50.240 --> 44:51.759
"What a jerk.

44:51.760 --> 44:53.319
"But brilliant."

44:53.320 --> 44:58.957
Every day, there's
an entry in there, all about you.

45:01.320 --> 45:03.320
It's all my fault.

45:05.240 --> 45:07.719
I worked him too hard. I'm so sorry.

45:07.720 --> 45:10.902
No-one is to blame for his choices.

45:10.920 --> 45:15.011
He had a job he loved
and... a boss he adored.

45:16.560 --> 45:19.379
Who can ask for more than that?

45:27.440 --> 45:29.080
Simon...

45:37.240 --> 45:41.039
"Assigned to
Dr Fairley today. Very smart.

45:41.040 --> 45:43.559
"Not as much of a prick
as Dr Harrow."

45:43.560 --> 45:45.742
Oh, thank you VERY much.

45:46.720 --> 45:49.519
"Today, Dr Harrow realised I'm gay.

45:49.520 --> 45:51.399
"It's only taken him two months."

45:51.400 --> 45:53.720
I knew from the start!

45:55.360 --> 45:58.439
"Dr Harrow doesn't understand
the point of a wardrobe.

45:58.440 --> 45:59.959
"He dresses badly.

45:59.960 --> 46:01.879
"His choice of shirts is appalling

46:01.880 --> 46:04.559
"and he's obsessed with
old people's music."

46:04.560 --> 46:06.720
"Old people"?!

46:08.600 --> 46:10.120
Dad?

46:18.680 --> 46:20.590
What are we gonna do?

46:21.120 --> 46:22.840
I was wrong.

46:24.280 --> 46:26.239
There is no conspiracy.

46:26.240 --> 46:28.719
No-one is out to get me.

46:28.720 --> 46:32.440
Simon's dead
and I think it's my fault.

46:34.880 --> 46:37.039
Your mum was right.

46:37.040 --> 46:40.586
I need to spend my time
with the living.

46:40.760 --> 46:42.519
With you.

46:42.520 --> 46:45.000
No more chasing ghosts.

46:53.000 --> 46:54.160
Hey.

46:55.240 --> 46:56.600
Come here.

47:00.880 --> 47:02.519
How was it?

47:02.520 --> 47:05.800
Sad. Awful. It's not fair.

47:09.200 --> 47:11.040
I need the bike.

47:12.120 --> 47:13.639
Wait. Where you going?

47:13.640 --> 47:17.004
Dad thinks he's wrong,
but... I don't.

47:17.280 --> 47:19.839
Wait, Fish. Just...

47:19.840 --> 47:21.360
Fish...

47:34.960 --> 47:36.320
Ross?

47:37.320 --> 47:38.720
You in there?

47:42.080 --> 47:43.560
Moran?

51:04.160 --> 51:05.919
Next on Harrow...

51:05.920 --> 51:08.079
How many people
have you told about Chester?

51:08.080 --> 51:10.679
Let it go, Daniel,
before somebody else gets hurt.

51:10.680 --> 51:12.399
You and Moran
are both involved.

51:12.400 --> 51:15.159
You have to get out of here.
The less you know, the better!

51:15.160 --> 51:16.719
Pack a bag.
I'm sending you west.

51:16.720 --> 51:18.599
Beautiful country,
isn't it?

51:18.600 --> 51:20.519
You're FROM here?

51:20.520 --> 51:23.159
So, there are SOME secrets
in the country.

51:23.160 --> 51:25.479
Not a busy stretch of road.

51:25.480 --> 51:28.119
And, yet, they ran
straight into each other.

51:28.120 --> 51:31.359
But if there was another person
in the vehicle,

51:31.360 --> 51:34.451
they're still out there somewhere.
