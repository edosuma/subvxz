WEBVTT

00:00.246 --> 00:03.677
Going all the way up to the
front, if you want to follow me.

00:03.765 --> 00:05.765
All the way up here, file in please.

00:06.716 --> 00:10.038
Here is the museum's most valuable piece,

00:10.063 --> 00:12.954
"Thumb", painted by Carpaccio MacGuffin

00:12.955 --> 00:14.658
the Scottish Italian master,

00:14.720 --> 00:18.934
this painting is the last work he
ever did before he went into seclusion.

00:18.934 --> 00:21.653
It is worth well over $10 million.

00:21.654 --> 00:24.091
Look in front of you,
see these velvet ropes,

00:24.116 --> 00:27.428
they prevent anyone from
getting close to the painting.

00:29.207 --> 00:33.994
And as an added level of
security, look at the sign.

00:34.079 --> 00:36.772
Let's move on to the room
with the boring pots in it.

00:36.772 --> 00:41.359
Follow me right this
way. Everyone this way.

00:43.000 --> 00:49.074

01:20.967 --> 01:25.118
I don't believe indigenous people had
micro waves and one could only imagine

01:25.142 --> 01:27.100
the bland food they cooked in these pots.

01:27.101 --> 01:31.014
Here we have well preserved
examples of Greek and Roman statutes,

01:31.014 --> 01:34.684
you can see that they're a
depiction of the ideal human form

01:34.735 --> 01:36.420
except for this one, of course,

01:36.445 --> 01:41.617
which is the fat slovenly Cupid, god of
love, clearly he loved pizza most of all.

01:43.760 --> 01:48.619
Now follow me over here and take a
look at the museum's most prized...

02:04.340 --> 02:06.340
Tribeca, Geils!

02:07.217 --> 02:09.809
Toby, knock it off, will you?

02:09.809 --> 02:11.790
Sorry, Lieutenant the other
day you requested more hubbub.

02:11.889 --> 02:15.510
- OK. Take it down to a dull roar.
- Gottcha.

02:18.181 --> 02:20.181
Geils, Tribeca, my office.

02:24.232 --> 02:26.800
- You wanted to see us, sir?
- Yeah, you ever heard of

02:26.825 --> 02:30.185
- Carpaccio MacGuffin?
- The Scottish Italian master

02:30.185 --> 02:32.722
who disappeared after painting
his masterwork "Thumb"?

02:32.831 --> 02:36.389
Yes, obviously. MacGuffin's
"Thumb" disappeared

02:36.389 --> 02:39.425
- from the Olsen-Medavoy Gallery this morning.
- The OMG.

02:39.510 --> 02:41.641
I thought it was at the
Lewis Oberby Library.

02:41.741 --> 02:45.348
The LOL, don't make me laugh,
that burned down last year,

02:45.348 --> 02:47.465
- so they moved it.
- And what did they build in its place?

02:47.466 --> 02:51.191
Another one of those damn parking
garages from the Wayne Tyson Foundation.

02:51.191 --> 02:53.574
- WTF!
- I know just what we needed,

02:53.574 --> 02:54.987
but you heard about Tyson, right?

02:54.987 --> 02:58.105
He came down with a
testicular membrane infection.

02:58.205 --> 03:00.274
- TMI?
- For realsies.

03:00.274 --> 03:03.945
This is your divorce agreement.
Btdubs, you got robbed.

03:03.946 --> 03:06.800
I know. FML.

03:19.637 --> 03:21.968
It's okay, kid, you wouldn't
be human if you didn't

03:21.968 --> 03:24.258
have some type of reaction
to a missing painting.

03:29.545 --> 03:31.545
- Scholls, what do got here?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, Detective.

03:31.769 --> 03:33.569
Watch out for the velvet ropes.

03:34.391 --> 03:36.807
- What do we got?
- Whoever did this knew what he was doing.

03:36.831 --> 03:38.144
He got past the ropes no problem.

03:38.145 --> 03:40.530
- So what about the sign?
- He was very clever here.

03:40.630 --> 03:44.159
Look how he altered the meaning of the sign
by spray painting over the word "not".

03:44.159 --> 03:47.425
"Do touch". Man, that's diabolical.

03:47.923 --> 03:49.572
We're taking as many prints as possible.

03:49.672 --> 03:51.175
We'll let you know what we come up with.

03:52.385 --> 03:54.408
What's going on with this pedestal here.

03:54.408 --> 03:55.760
Oh there was a cupid statute there

03:55.860 --> 03:57.539
but it was just a temporary exhibit on loan

03:57.564 --> 04:01.903
from an antiquities dealer, a Dr. Zaius.

04:02.091 --> 04:05.523
- We're on it.
- Well Tribeca, time for a checkup.

04:05.548 --> 04:10.574
- If the doctor is in.
- I sure hope so, I have a * hernia.

04:27.507 --> 04:30.086
I just love old stuff. Everything about it.

04:30.110 --> 04:32.110
The smell, the feel...

04:32.872 --> 04:37.078
- L.A.P.D., are you Dr. Zaius?
- Oh no, Dr. Zaius is my brother.

04:37.102 --> 04:39.102
I'm just Mr. Zaius.

04:39.838 --> 04:43.055
- You guys can call me Randy.
- Quite a shiner you've got there, Randy.

04:43.155 --> 04:44.606
Oh, thank you.

04:45.114 --> 04:46.372
I call it a mop.

04:46.425 --> 04:48.590
- Is your brother around?
- Oh, yeah. Sorry.

04:50.056 --> 04:52.825
Randy? What kind of a name is "Randy"?

04:52.826 --> 04:56.219
It's Welsh actually. Good
afternoon, I'm Dr. Zaius.

04:56.219 --> 04:57.385
How can I help you?

04:57.387 --> 04:59.454
Wow, you really do look
a lot like your brother.

04:59.556 --> 05:02.056
Really? I don't see it. Please come in.

05:12.902 --> 05:14.402
Would you like some coffee?

05:14.404 --> 05:15.787
Yes, please.

05:15.789 --> 05:17.905
I'm Detective Tribeca,
this is Detective Geils,

05:17.907 --> 05:19.407
and we're here to talk to you
about what happened

05:19.409 --> 05:21.125
at the Olsen-Medavoy Gallery.

05:23.296 --> 05:24.245
Ohh! Aah!

05:24.247 --> 05:26.080
Oh, my god, that's terrible.

05:26.082 --> 05:28.249
- And really cold.
- I'm not surprised.

05:28.251 --> 05:30.885
This coffee was brewed
by Napoleon Bonaparte

05:30.887 --> 05:32.804
just before the Battle of Waterloo.

05:34.257 --> 05:36.557
Would you care for some macaroons

05:36.559 --> 05:38.259
from the age of enlightenment?

05:38.261 --> 05:40.971
How about a potato chip from
the Kennedy administration?

05:41.272 --> 05:42.072
Okay.

05:42.143 --> 05:44.042
Were you aware
that MacGuffin's "Thumb"

05:44.147 --> 05:46.294
was stolen from the OMG this morning?

05:46.349 --> 05:49.934
How awful. That's such a seminal piece.

05:51.271 --> 05:52.737
That's not what it means.

05:52.739 --> 05:57.692
Apparently, one of your statues
was on loan to the museum from...

05:57.694 --> 05:59.611
yesterday to today.

05:59.613 --> 06:02.497
I'm always happy to share
my antiquities with the world.

06:02.499 --> 06:04.365
They really belong to all of us.

06:04.367 --> 06:06.451
- Can we see it?
- No. It's mine.

06:06.453 --> 06:08.753
The painting was there. The statue arrives.

06:08.755 --> 06:11.873
The painting disappears.
The statue disappears.

06:11.875 --> 06:14.676
If you say so. Frankly, the
comings and goings of the pieces

06:14.678 --> 06:17.378
is Randy's responsibility,
and he's a first-class idiot,

06:17.380 --> 06:19.214
a real dumb-dumb double zero.

06:19.216 --> 06:21.216
Now, if you'll excuse me, the cake from

06:21.218 --> 06:23.718
Theodore Roosevelt's 35th
birthday just arrived,

06:23.720 --> 06:25.386
and it's in terrible condition.

06:25.388 --> 06:26.471
Sit down, Zaius!

06:26.473 --> 06:28.301
You're trying to tell me

06:28.327 --> 06:30.124
that that timeline is coincidental?

06:30.238 --> 06:31.488
How dare you come in here

06:31.489 --> 06:34.239
with your cheap suit
and your lousy haircut?

06:34.241 --> 06:35.874
Where did you get that, ladies prison?

06:35.899 --> 06:37.899
Salon Training Studio.

06:37.924 --> 06:38.639
How about this?

06:38.999 --> 06:41.849
I'll make some inquiries in
the art world, ask around.

06:41.955 --> 06:44.706
If I find anything out, I'll call you.

06:45.182 --> 06:46.265
What's the number?

06:46.290 --> 06:48.358
- It's 3...
- Oh, hold on.

06:48.470 --> 06:50.470
Ink dried up.

06:50.472 --> 06:51.438
Go ahead.

06:51.440 --> 06:53.773
- It's 3...
- Oh, dried up again.

06:53.775 --> 06:55.892
Go ahead.

06:55.894 --> 06:56.977
- It's 3...
- Oops.

06:56.979 --> 06:59.145
Dried up. Sorry.

06:59.147 --> 07:00.730
One more time. Go ahead.

07:00.732 --> 07:03.066
- It's 3...
- No, it dried up. Sorry.

07:04.119 --> 07:05.819
- Go ahead.
- It's 3...

07:05.821 --> 07:07.704
Ah, shoot. Dried up.

07:08.540 --> 07:11.157
- It's 3...
- No, it dried up again.

07:11.159 --> 07:13.577
So sorry. One more time. Go.

07:13.579 --> 07:15.712
- It's 3...
- All right, don't say "it's."

07:15.714 --> 07:18.298
That's what's taking the
time... the word "it's."

07:18.300 --> 07:20.584
You say it, it dries up, okay?

07:20.586 --> 07:21.586
Go.

07:21.587 --> 07:23.920
- 3...
- Too late.

07:25.173 --> 07:26.840
Tell you what... I have
a photographic memory.

07:26.842 --> 07:29.309
You say it, and I'll...
I'll just remember it.

07:29.311 --> 07:30.311
- Go ahead.
- Okay, 333...

07:30.312 --> 07:32.395
- Mm-hmm...
- 2333.

07:32.397 --> 07:34.014
Okay, start any time you want.

07:37.064 --> 07:40.204
I feel like Dr. Zaius
is giving us the runaround.

07:40.205 --> 07:42.135
You think he has something to
do with the stolen painting?

07:42.212 --> 07:44.634
I don't know. I think this
one we just leave unsolved.

07:44.634 --> 07:45.879
Leave unsolved?

07:46.035 --> 07:48.746
I've literally never heard either of
those words come out of your mouth,

07:48.809 --> 07:50.104
and I've known you for three weeks.

07:50.106 --> 07:52.391
It's just a dumb, old painting. Who cares?

07:52.647 --> 07:53.343
"Who cares?"

07:53.462 --> 07:55.893
I've literally never heard either of
those words come out of your mouth,

07:55.895 --> 07:57.361
and I've known you for three weeks.

07:57.363 --> 07:59.527
Is there something going
on here I don't know about?

07:59.918 --> 08:01.365
Let's just drop it, okay?

08:01.367 --> 08:03.701
- I'll tell you when you really push me on it later.
- Fine.

08:03.703 --> 08:06.070
If Dr. Zaius hasn't given
us enough information

08:06.072 --> 08:07.955
to make him a prime suspect,

08:07.957 --> 08:10.541
maybe his brother, Randy, can chime in.

08:10.543 --> 08:11.993
Are you in or out?

08:11.995 --> 08:15.129
Let's roll.

08:22.405 --> 08:23.704
Oh.

08:23.706 --> 08:24.906
Yeah?

08:24.908 --> 08:26.908
Randy Zaius? L.A.P.D.

08:26.910 --> 08:28.459
Do you remember us from this afternoon?

08:28.461 --> 08:30.544
Oh, yeah, yeah. I remember you guys.

08:30.546 --> 08:31.579
Come on in.

08:37.544 --> 08:38.722
Nice place.

08:38.748 --> 08:41.914
Thanks. It's cheap, but it's inexpensive.

08:42.024 --> 08:44.774
No one gets into the
antiquities game for the money.

08:44.776 --> 08:46.610
It's funny that you mention
that because I noticed

08:46.612 --> 08:50.147
that your brother, Dr. Zaius,
was wearing a $1,500 suit today.

08:50.149 --> 08:51.565
We took a look at his tax records,

08:51.567 --> 08:54.651
and it turns out he owns
a boathouse, a house boat,

08:54.653 --> 08:56.987
a pool house and a house pool.

08:56.989 --> 09:00.157
Oh, I wouldn't know. I've
never been to his house.

09:00.159 --> 09:02.075
Hmm. Did you paint that?

09:02.077 --> 09:04.327
Yeah. It's not very good, I know.

09:04.329 --> 09:05.623
But I'm... I'm just starting.

09:05.723 --> 09:07.686
A kangaroo with a light switch for a head.

09:07.749 --> 09:09.715
What do you call it... a kanger-switch?

09:09.717 --> 09:11.000
Actually, it's a switcheroo.

09:11.002 --> 09:12.635
Clever. I'd like to buy it.

09:12.637 --> 09:14.337
Oh, you don't want that.
It's a terrible painting.

09:14.339 --> 09:15.838
You can get something better than that.

09:15.840 --> 09:16.631
That one's garbage.

09:16.631 --> 09:19.178
Did Dr. Zaius give you
that black eye, Randy?

09:19.334 --> 09:21.584
Yeah, but we like to punch
each other in the eye.

09:21.586 --> 09:23.169
I mean, I punched him yesterday,

09:23.171 --> 09:24.420
so it was kind of his turn.

09:24.422 --> 09:25.922
It's a game. We call it "punch punch."

09:25.924 --> 09:27.590
Your brother doesn't treat
you very well, does he?

09:27.593 --> 09:29.510
Do you know anything about Dr. Zaius

09:29.511 --> 09:31.261
and the theft of MacGuffin's "Thumb"?

09:33.481 --> 09:36.649
If you'll excuse me, I have to, uh...

09:36.651 --> 09:39.235
I have to use the restroom.

09:40.822 --> 09:42.989
Let's spread out.

10:03.206 --> 10:04.572
Tribeca, get over here.

10:04.574 --> 10:05.873
On my way.

10:06.424 --> 10:07.502
What's up?

10:10.213 --> 10:11.746
MacGuffin's "Thumb."

10:13.250 --> 10:15.300
If you'll excuse me, uh,

10:15.302 --> 10:17.085
all my roommates are
about to show up, so I...

10:17.087 --> 10:18.970
- You son of a bitch!
- Aah!

10:18.972 --> 10:20.338
Whoa!

10:20.340 --> 10:21.889
You're under arrest for grand theft art-o.

10:21.891 --> 10:23.174
It's not what you think.

10:23.176 --> 10:24.225
Give me a reason!

10:24.227 --> 10:25.810
I dare you.

10:25.812 --> 10:27.345
He just took a painting.
It's not that big of a deal.

10:27.347 --> 10:29.514
Don't tell me how to do my job!

10:29.516 --> 10:30.682
- Ohh!
- Give me a reason!

10:30.684 --> 10:32.233
I dare you!

10:32.235 --> 10:33.568
Ohh! Aah!

10:39.364 --> 10:41.489
Things got a little heated back there, huh?

10:41.561 --> 10:43.278
I don't want to talk about it.

10:43.280 --> 10:46.147
You got to tell me what's
going on with you and this case.

10:46.149 --> 10:48.232
You know we never solve it till you do.

10:51.788 --> 10:55.657
I was a young art student living in Paris.

10:55.659 --> 10:57.825
I was living in the French quarter.

10:57.827 --> 11:00.328
I was just getting out of a relationship.

11:08.338 --> 11:11.139
That was the worst first date I ever had.

11:12.559 --> 11:15.176
I needed someone who wanted
the things that I wanted.

11:16.513 --> 11:21.015
And that was Carpaccio MacGuffin.

11:21.817 --> 11:26.154
It was exciting, exhilarating.

11:27.357 --> 11:31.526
We did things I never dreamed of.

11:31.528 --> 11:37.615
He was loving, considerate, thoughtful...

11:37.617 --> 11:39.834
sensuous.

11:41.087 --> 11:43.838
I knew I had to get out of there.

11:46.710 --> 11:50.178
I loved him, but I knew I couldn't stay

11:50.180 --> 11:54.215
because that's what I do... I leave.

12:12.402 --> 12:15.203
So that was the
inspiration for the "Thumb."

12:15.205 --> 12:16.821
Amazing.

12:16.823 --> 12:18.706
You think maybe you leave
people before they leave you?

12:18.708 --> 12:20.742
You think
maybe you leave people

12:20.744 --> 12:21.715
before they leave you?

12:21.815 --> 12:23.364
All right, fine. Forget it.

12:23.366 --> 12:25.033
Let's just put Randy away.

12:25.035 --> 12:26.150
It's up here on the right,

12:26.152 --> 12:27.702
where it says "Police Precinct."

12:27.704 --> 12:29.954
Okay, I got it.

12:32.876 --> 12:34.209
Turn to the right.

12:36.746 --> 12:38.580
Turn to the left.

12:41.418 --> 12:44.002
All right. Let's bring in the whole family.

12:44.004 --> 12:45.420
Come on in. Come on in, Betts.

12:45.422 --> 12:47.922
Okay, y'all ready? At the
count of three, "Cheese."

12:47.924 --> 12:50.592
One, two, three! "Cheese!"

12:51.940 --> 12:53.271
You wanted to see us, Doctor?

12:53.371 --> 12:56.038
Ah, good evening, Detectives!

12:56.040 --> 12:57.540
I took a look at that
painting you recovered

12:57.542 --> 12:59.425
from Randy Zaius' apartment.

12:59.426 --> 13:01.209
A genuine MacGuffin, eh?

13:08.219 --> 13:09.886
We don't know why you're laughing, sir.

13:09.888 --> 13:11.771
No. Of course. How could you?

13:11.773 --> 13:13.578
You're not inside my head.
Now, let me show you something.

13:13.578 --> 13:16.914
Now, here we have Leonardo
Da Vinci's "Mona Lisa,"

13:17.118 --> 13:20.319
which we had FedExed in from
the Louvre Museum in Paris.

13:20.321 --> 13:23.823
And here...

13:23.825 --> 13:28.911
Here we have a cheap forgery on
loan from a cheap forgery store.

13:28.913 --> 13:30.546
Or is it?

13:30.548 --> 13:32.665
Could this be the real "Mona Lisa"

13:32.667 --> 13:34.583
and could this be the forgery?

13:34.585 --> 13:36.585
Real, forge. Forge, real.

13:36.587 --> 13:38.471
Follow the bouncing ball. Which is it?

13:38.473 --> 13:41.640
- I can tell them apart.
- Oh, really, Detective?

13:41.642 --> 13:43.642
Then why don't you pull out your big gun

13:43.644 --> 13:45.678
and shoot the forgery?

13:45.680 --> 13:47.763
Great.

13:49.400 --> 13:50.599
Wrong, Detective.

13:50.601 --> 13:52.601
You've just shot the real "Mona Lisa"

13:52.603 --> 13:55.104
and the lab technician standing behind it.

13:56.574 --> 13:58.941
You tricked me. I'm not paying for that.

13:58.943 --> 14:00.442
They're both forgeries.

14:00.444 --> 14:03.362
Exactly, Tribeca. They are both forgeries.

14:03.364 --> 14:06.532
Look at the cheap canvas,
the amateur brushstrokes,

14:06.534 --> 14:08.701
the lack of contrast
between light and dark,

14:08.703 --> 14:11.086
the stickers that say "75 cents."

14:11.088 --> 14:13.589
Ah.

14:13.591 --> 14:15.958
At last, someone who
knows something about art.

14:15.960 --> 14:17.261
What's the point of all this, Doctor?

14:17.361 --> 14:18.527
The point?

14:18.529 --> 14:19.861
The point?

14:19.863 --> 14:21.363
Ooh, I love an inquiring mind.

14:21.365 --> 14:23.448
Let's have another look at
your so-called MacGuffin,

14:23.450 --> 14:25.200
shall we?

14:28.512 --> 14:29.588
Oh, my god.

14:29.590 --> 14:30.705
How did I miss this?

14:30.707 --> 14:34.543
Yeah, how did you miss
this? It's so obvious.

14:34.545 --> 14:35.961
Why is it obvious?

14:35.963 --> 14:37.796
It's obvious that it's a forgery,

14:37.798 --> 14:39.181
although a brilliant one.

14:39.183 --> 14:40.932
The canvas is authentic to the period.

14:40.934 --> 14:42.184
The brushstrokes are exact.

14:42.186 --> 14:45.136
It's absolutely indistinguishable
from the original.

14:45.138 --> 14:46.638
Except for the fact

14:46.640 --> 14:48.523
that MacGuffin was crying
when he painted the "Thumb,"

14:48.525 --> 14:51.560
and the tears diluted the paint
in the bottom-right corner.

14:51.562 --> 14:54.279
Exactly. As you can see, no tears.

14:54.281 --> 14:57.816
So Randy forged the "Thumb," but why?

15:10.047 --> 15:12.214
How's jail treating you, Randy?

15:12.216 --> 15:15.016
You literally brought me
in here five minutes ago.

15:15.018 --> 15:17.869
Yeah, time goes slow in
the joint, doesn't it?

15:19.456 --> 15:22.791
The painting we got from
your apartment is a forgery,

15:22.793 --> 15:26.494
which begs the question...
where's the original?

15:26.496 --> 15:29.664
Look, I'll tell you
everything you need to know.

15:29.666 --> 15:32.050
But first, I want immunity.

15:32.052 --> 15:35.337
Immunity? That's what you want, huh?

15:39.883 --> 15:42.093
- You allergic to eggs?
- Uh, no.

15:42.095 --> 15:43.478
- Okay.
- Go ahead.

15:43.480 --> 15:45.981
Ow.

15:45.983 --> 15:47.349
That wasn't so bad.

15:47.351 --> 15:50.018
- Now, where's the "Thumb"?
- My brother has it.

15:50.020 --> 15:52.187
He steals the art, and then I forge it.

15:52.189 --> 15:54.189
He returns the forgeries
back to the art gallery,

15:54.291 --> 15:56.358
and the police drop the whole thing.

15:56.360 --> 15:58.860
He ends up with a
multimillion-dollar art collection.

15:58.862 --> 16:00.528
Why roll on him now?

16:00.530 --> 16:03.915
Because he's a total...

16:03.917 --> 16:05.500
Dick!

16:05.572 --> 16:07.939
You don't have to deal with him no more,

16:07.942 --> 16:11.494
'cause we are about to take Dr. Zaius down.

16:13.030 --> 16:14.829
Now, you're free to go.

16:14.831 --> 16:17.949
Can someone un-cuff me?

16:17.951 --> 16:19.918
You're not cuffed.

16:21.621 --> 16:24.456
Oh. Great. Thanks.

16:24.458 --> 16:26.124
You can validate your
parking on the way out.

16:26.126 --> 16:29.377
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah. No problem.

16:32.934 --> 16:34.934
Don't move, Dr. Zaius!

16:34.935 --> 16:37.135
You idiot! Do you see what you've done?!

16:37.137 --> 16:39.137
That was a priceless Moravian vase.

16:39.139 --> 16:41.139
It will take you a lifetime to pay...

16:41.141 --> 16:43.692
It seems to be fine. How can I help you?

16:43.694 --> 16:46.111
You're under arrest for
stealing MacGuffin's "Thumb"

16:46.113 --> 16:47.812
from the Olsen-Medavoy Gallery.

16:47.814 --> 16:49.114
Your brother ratted you out.

16:49.116 --> 16:51.399
Don't be ridiculous. I
haven't stolen anything.

16:51.401 --> 16:54.452
Then how do you explain this?

16:54.454 --> 16:56.654
I have no idea how that got there.

16:56.656 --> 16:58.156
I'm being framed!

16:58.158 --> 17:00.325
Officer, take him away.

17:03.747 --> 17:05.163
We did it.

17:05.165 --> 17:07.715
Now let's get this thing back to a museum,

17:07.718 --> 17:09.501
where it belongs.

17:09.502 --> 17:11.336
Everyone freeze!

17:12.005 --> 17:14.089
You're out. Go sit down.

17:15.008 --> 17:18.343
Un-freeze.

17:18.345 --> 17:21.846
No tears. This one's a forgery, too.

17:21.848 --> 17:23.263
Damn it.

17:23.267 --> 17:25.434
But Randy said that Zaius had the original.

17:25.435 --> 17:27.652
What, did he pull some kind of switcheroo?

17:29.439 --> 17:32.690
- Switcheroo!
- Switcheroo!

17:35.195 --> 17:39.415
Randy Zaius, L.A.P.D.! Open the door!

17:39.416 --> 17:40.448
Take it down.

17:43.170 --> 17:46.454
Go! Go! Go!

17:46.456 --> 17:49.040
- Go! Go!
-  Keep it moving! Let's go!

17:50.343 --> 17:53.128
Come on! Let's go! Go, go, go!

18:08.228 --> 18:10.445
It's Tanner. He isn't here.

18:14.651 --> 18:17.202
Get him!

18:26.580 --> 18:28.963
You know, my first
apartment out of the academy

18:28.965 --> 18:30.915
was way smaller than this one.

18:30.917 --> 18:32.217
You don't say?

18:32.219 --> 18:34.886
10 guys crammed into a 24-story walk-up.

18:34.888 --> 18:37.422
And you know what the
biggest pain in the butt was?

18:38.675 --> 18:41.593
Ohh!

18:41.595 --> 18:43.928
Opening the damn fridge.

18:54.825 --> 19:00.078
It's Tanner. "Thumb's" up.

19:01.198 --> 19:02.530
All right.

19:02.532 --> 19:04.782
Looks like the "Thumb's"
back up at the gallery.

19:04.784 --> 19:06.284
All right.

19:06.286 --> 19:08.119
I got to say you were
pretty terrific back there.

19:08.121 --> 19:09.454
You weren't bad yourself.

19:09.456 --> 19:11.589
I feel like we're really
finding our groove.

19:11.591 --> 19:12.624
Mm-hmm.

19:13.935 --> 19:15.318
My mom was right.

19:15.320 --> 19:17.854
When you meet the right
partner, you just know.

19:17.857 --> 19:19.824
- Mm-hmm.
- In fact, you should meet my mom.

19:19.826 --> 19:22.076
- I've already told her so much about you.
- Hmm.

19:22.078 --> 19:23.646
Is it weird we don't have
more pictures together?

19:23.746 --> 19:25.045
I got to get out of here.

19:27.394 --> 19:31.360
I'm not gonna let you run away from
a good thing this time, Angie Tribeca.

19:34.866 --> 19:36.399
I got to go take a poop.
