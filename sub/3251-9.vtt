Signal is genuine.

00:24.640 --> 00:26.480
Prepare to launch nuclear weapons.

00:26.480 --> 00:28.080
Aye, sir.

00:31.400 --> 00:33.640
'Moscow confirming launch sequence.'

00:33.640 --> 00:36.600
The Firebird stands ready to serve.

00:36.600 --> 00:38.040
For the Motherland.

00:38.040 --> 00:39.200
For the Motherland.

# Oh, Vienna. #

00:55.240 --> 00:56.600
Have I interrupted something?

00:56.600 --> 01:00.520
We were about to blow
up the world, Professor.

01:00.520 --> 01:02.160
Again?

01:02.160 --> 01:05.120
Ultravox! I bloody love 'em.

01:05.120 --> 01:07.280
Got a friend who sends me the tapes.

01:07.280 --> 01:10.240
This is the Captain. Drill
abandoned. All hands, stand down.

01:10.240 --> 01:12.000
Repeat - drill abandoned.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.960
With respect, sir, we must
run it again. Tomorrow.

01:14.960 --> 01:18.000
Comrade Captain,
the NATO exercises...

01:18.000 --> 01:19.280
Sabre-rattling.

01:20.480 --> 01:21.520
I don't think so.

01:21.520 --> 01:23.680
Oh, you don't think so?

01:23.680 --> 01:26.440
Sir, American aggression gets
more intolerable by the day.

01:26.440 --> 01:28.200
We must run the drill again!

01:29.640 --> 01:30.680
Tomorrow.

01:33.800 --> 01:36.000
Did you have your specimen
stowed OK?

01:36.000 --> 01:37.400
Yeah, Piotr's looking after it.

01:37.400 --> 01:39.120
Well, at least we have
something to show

01:39.120 --> 01:42.400
for our little hunting expedition.
What is it? A mammoth?

01:43.960 --> 01:45.160
Probably.

No, this is much better!

03:48.880 --> 03:50.600
A sinking submarine?

03:50.600 --> 03:52.840
A sinking SOVIET submarine!

03:52.840 --> 03:55.000
Break out side arms! Restrain them!

03:55.000 --> 03:58.520
410. 420!
Turbines still not responding!

03:58.520 --> 03:59.880
They've got to!

03:59.880 --> 04:03.920
Ah! Sideways momentum!
You've still got sideways momentum!

04:03.920 --> 04:07.320
What? Your propellers work
independently of the main turbines.

04:07.320 --> 04:10.520
You can't stop her going down but
you can manoeuvre the sub laterally!

04:10.520 --> 04:11.560
Do it!

04:11.560 --> 04:13.280
Get these people off the bridge now!

04:13.280 --> 04:14.880
Just listen to him, for God's sake!

04:14.880 --> 04:18.720
Geographical anomaly to starboard -
probably an underwater ridge.

04:18.720 --> 04:20.240
How do you know this?

04:20.240 --> 04:24.400
Look, we have just a chance to stop
the descent if we settle on it.

04:24.400 --> 04:25.440
Do it...

04:25.440 --> 04:29.000
600 metres, sir. 610...

04:29.000 --> 04:30.840
..or this thing is going to implode!

04:30.840 --> 04:35.040
Lateral thrust to starboard -
all propellers! Sir? Now!

04:35.040 --> 04:38.120
You're going to let this madman
give the orders? Lateral thrust!

04:38.120 --> 04:39.240
Aye, sir!

05:15.040 --> 05:17.720
I'll hold you to that.
Might come in handy!

05:18.800 --> 05:20.520
Search them.

05:20.520 --> 05:24.520
Yes, I know, it's a WOMAN.
Now search them!

05:24.520 --> 05:26.960
Eh? Ooh!

05:27.960 --> 05:29.600
Are we going to be OK? Oh, yes.

05:29.600 --> 05:30.960
Is that a lie? Possibly.

05:30.960 --> 05:32.240
Very dangerous time, Clara.

05:32.240 --> 05:34.640
East and West standing on the brink
of nuclear oblivion.

05:34.640 --> 05:37.640
Lots of itchy fingers on the button.
Isn't it always like that? Sort of.

05:37.640 --> 05:40.920
But there are flash points and this
is one - hair, shoulder pads, nukes.

05:40.920 --> 05:43.520
It's the '80s. Everything's bigger!

05:44.880 --> 05:47.360

06:14.960 --> 06:18.120
Captain, we didn't know the type
of your ship out here...

06:19.960 --> 06:23.000
Yeah, well, that's till the rescue
ship comes. IF it comes!

06:23.000 --> 06:26.240
Oh, the sinking is just a
coincidence, is it? Who are you?

06:29.560 --> 06:30.920
All right, Captain, all right.

06:30.920 --> 06:33.680
You know what? Just this once,
no dissembling, no psychic paper,

06:33.680 --> 06:35.440
no pretending to be an Earth
Ambassador.

06:35.440 --> 06:37.760
Doctor - me and Clara, time
travellers. Clara, you OK?

06:37.760 --> 06:38.960
Think so. Time travellers?

06:38.960 --> 06:41.480
We arrived here out of thin air!
You saw it happen! I didn't.

06:41.480 --> 06:44.440
Your problem, mate, not mine! We
were sinking... Yes. What happened?

06:44.440 --> 06:47.360
We sank. No, what happened to the
TARDIS? Never mind that. Listen...

06:47.360 --> 06:50.440
Captain, breath's precious down
here. Let's not waste it, eh?

06:50.440 --> 06:53.680
You're right, maybe I can save
a little oxygen by having
you both shot?

06:53.680 --> 06:56.760
What does it matter how we arrived?
The important thing is to get...

06:56.760 --> 06:58.640
WATERY GROWLING

07:01.400 --> 07:03.200
..out. Exactly!

07:03.200 --> 07:06.680

not suffocating!

07:06.680 --> 07:12.200
Eh? Ah, oh, thank you!
Finally, seeing sense!

07:12.200 --> 07:14.600
Now, what sort of state
is the sub in? Doctor!

07:14.600 --> 07:17.640
What about the radio?
Can we send a... DOCTOR! What?!

07:17.640 --> 07:19.320

..it never rains but it pours.

07:39.480 --> 07:44.680
We were drilling for oil in the ice.
I thought I'd found a mammoth.

07:44.680 --> 07:46.240
It's not a mammoth.

07:46.240 --> 07:47.360
No.

07:49.120 --> 07:50.760
What is it, then?

07:50.760 --> 07:52.600
It's an Ice Warrior.

07:52.600 --> 07:54.680
A native of the planet Mars.

07:55.800 --> 07:56.920
And we go way back...

07:58.560 --> 08:00.880
..WAY back. A Martian?
You can't be serious.

08:00.880 --> 08:02.680
I'm always serious. With days off.

08:02.680 --> 08:05.040
Doctor! Just keeping it light,
Clara, they're scared.

08:05.040 --> 08:06.840

Just hear me out!

08:13.120 --> 08:15.840
You're confused, disorientated -
of course you are.

08:15.840 --> 08:18.800
You've been lying dormant
in the ice for, for how long?

08:18.800 --> 08:20.080
How long, Professor?

08:20.080 --> 08:22.320
By my reckoning, 5,000 years.

08:22.320 --> 08:24.400
5,000 years? That's a hell of a nap.

08:24.400 --> 08:26.800
Can't blame you if you've got
out of the wrong side of bed.

08:26.800 --> 08:29.280
Nobody here wants to hurt you.

08:29.280 --> 08:31.440
Please, just, why don't
you tell us your name?

08:31.440 --> 08:33.200
What're you talking about?
It has a name?

08:33.200 --> 08:35.840
Of course it has a name -
and a rank. This is a soldier.

08:35.840 --> 08:37.840
And it deserves our respect.

08:37.840 --> 08:40.440
This is madness. That is a monster!

08:40.440 --> 08:41.679
Skaldak.

08:50.120 --> 08:51.640
What did you say?

08:51.640 --> 08:53.920
I am Grand Marshal Skaldak.

08:58.320 --> 09:00.280
(Oh, no.)

09:00.280 --> 09:03.080
WATERY GROWLING

09:05.600 --> 09:07.040
You idiot!

09:13.400 --> 09:15.560
You...idiot!

09:17.800 --> 09:19.200
Grand Marshal Skaldak.

09:21.520 --> 09:24.400
You...know him?

09:25.480 --> 09:31.600
Sovereign of the Tharsisian caste,
vanquisher of the Phobos Heresy.

09:31.600 --> 09:35.040
The greatest hero the proud Martian
race has ever produced.

09:37.240 --> 09:38.360
So what do we do now?

09:39.720 --> 09:43.000
Lock...him...up!

09:43.000 --> 09:45.160
GROWLING

09:50.240 --> 09:51.840
Is it true?

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
True?

09:57.000 --> 10:00.600
I slept for 5,000 years?

10:05.320 --> 10:08.080
Er, that's what the professor says.

10:09.640 --> 10:12.920
5,000 years!

10:18.240 --> 10:21.760
The Ice Warriors have a different
creed, Clara. A different code.

10:21.760 --> 10:26.000
By his own standards,
Skaldak is a hero.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.880
It was said his enemies
honoured him so much

10:28.880 --> 10:31.800
they'd carve his name into their
own flesh before they died.

10:31.800 --> 10:34.520
Oh, yeah, very nice.
He sounds lovely.

10:34.520 --> 10:37.120
An Ice Warrior? Explain.
There isn't time!

10:37.120 --> 10:38.160
Try me.

10:38.160 --> 10:40.360
Martian reptile
known as the Ice Warrior.

10:40.360 --> 10:43.520
When Mars turned
cold they had to adapt.
They're bio-mechanoid - cyborgs.

10:43.520 --> 10:46.960
Built survival armour so they
could exist in the freezing
cold of their home world

10:46.960 --> 10:50.880
but an increase in temperature
and the armour goes haywire.
Like with the cattle prod thing?

10:50.880 --> 10:53.720
Bit of a design flaw, I've always
wondered why they never sorted it.

10:53.720 --> 10:56.600
You've got me telling you about them
and I said there wasn't time!

10:56.600 --> 10:58.040
Is he that dangerous?

11:01.560 --> 11:03.160
This one is.

11:03.160 --> 11:04.960
WATERY GROWLING

11:06.960 --> 11:12.840
Find me, my brothers.
If you are still out there.

11:12.840 --> 11:14.360
Find me.

11:16.960 --> 11:19.000
BEEPING

11:22.800 --> 11:25.920
Why are we listening to this
nonsense, Captain?

11:25.920 --> 11:29.400
These people are clearly
enemy agents. Eh?

11:29.400 --> 11:31.280
Spies, Captain!

11:31.280 --> 11:34.240
Pretty bad spies, mate.
I don't even speak Russian!

11:36.040 --> 11:37.600
What?

11:37.600 --> 11:38.880
I don't...

11:41.080 --> 11:43.400
Am I speaking Russian?
How come I'm speaking Russian?

11:43.400 --> 11:46.240
Now? We have to do this now?

11:46.240 --> 11:48.520
Are THEY speaking Russian?
Seriously? Now?!

11:48.520 --> 11:50.760
It's the TARDIS translation matrix.

11:50.760 --> 11:54.560
In my opinion, Comrade Captain,
this creature is a Western weapon.

11:54.560 --> 11:57.160
Are they? Yes! They're Russians!

11:57.160 --> 12:00.480
A weapon? Survival suit.
What is the alternative?

12:00.480 --> 12:02.200
The little green man from Mars?

12:02.200 --> 12:05.120
Correction. It's a BIG
green man from Mars.

12:05.120 --> 12:07.560
I do not appreciate
your levity, Professor.

12:07.560 --> 12:11.520
Why does that not surprise me?
Maybe they're telling the truth.

12:11.520 --> 12:13.360
The truth?

12:13.360 --> 12:16.400
Yes. A revolutionary
concept, I know.

12:16.400 --> 12:19.720
It's essential that we inform Moscow
of what we have found!

12:19.720 --> 12:22.520
The radio's out of action, in case
you hadn't noticed, Stepashin.

12:22.520 --> 12:25.520
They have our last position.
They will find us.

12:25.520 --> 12:27.000
When they do... Yes?

12:27.000 --> 12:29.840
Well, the Cold War won't stay cold
for ever, Captain.

12:29.840 --> 12:33.640
For God's sake, Stepashin,
you're like a stuck record!

12:33.640 --> 12:36.000
We have other priorities right now.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.560
I want you back on repairs
immediately,

12:38.560 --> 12:42.000
we need to keep this ship
alive. Dismissed.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.160
Sir...?

12:45.160 --> 12:46.840
Dismissed, Stepashin!

13:00.160 --> 13:06.160
All we needed to do was let Skaldak
go and he'd have forgotten us...

13:06.160 --> 13:08.840
but you've attacked him.
You declared war.

13:10.800 --> 13:13.720
"Harm one of us and you
harm us all."

13:13.720 --> 13:15.760
That's the ancient Martian code.
BEEPING

13:15.760 --> 13:20.520
You hear that?
Skaldak's sent out a distress call.

13:20.520 --> 13:24.280
He'll bring down the fires of hell
just for laying a glove on him!

13:24.280 --> 13:26.600
Unless you talk to it?
I'm the only one who can.

13:26.600 --> 13:29.120
No. Out of the question.
We're not losing you.

13:29.120 --> 13:31.720
I'll do it. What?
You can talk to it through me.

13:34.320 --> 13:37.240
Skaldak won't talk to you!
You're an enemy soldier!

13:37.240 --> 13:39.840
How would he know that?
A soldier knows another soldier.

13:39.840 --> 13:41.840
He'll smell it on you!
Smell it on you a mile off.

13:41.840 --> 13:44.320
And he wouldn't smell
it on you, Doctor?

13:46.440 --> 13:48.200
Just let me in there
before it's too late.

13:48.200 --> 13:50.760
It can't be you or any of your men.

13:50.760 --> 13:53.560
Well, it can't be you.

13:53.560 --> 13:55.560
CLARA CLEARING HER THROAT

13:59.400 --> 14:02.600
Well, there really is only one
choice, isn't there?

14:03.920 --> 14:06.000
I don't smell of anything...

14:06.000 --> 14:08.080
to my knowledge. You? No!

14:08.080 --> 14:11.120
No! No way. You're not going
in there alone, Clara.

14:11.120 --> 14:13.800
Absolutely not! No, no.

14:13.800 --> 14:15.080
Never!

14:39.480 --> 14:41.760
With your permission?

14:41.760 --> 14:42.800
Be my guest.

14:48.720 --> 14:49.760
Ready, Clara?

14:53.040 --> 14:54.760
Yeah. 'OK.'

14:57.760 --> 14:59.680
Grand Marshal Skaldak.

14:59.680 --> 15:01.080
The salute.

15:01.080 --> 15:03.960
'Do the salute like I showed you.'

15:03.960 --> 15:05.640
HISSING

15:05.640 --> 15:07.040
OK? Good.

15:08.280 --> 15:09.640
Good.

15:09.640 --> 15:12.880
Now, like we rehearsed.

15:12.880 --> 15:15.680
"Sovereign
of the Tharsisian caste..."

15:15.680 --> 15:19.760
"Sovereign of the Tharsisian caste.
By the moons, I honour thee."

15:19.760 --> 15:23.720
'(Good.) It's OK, Clara. Go closer.'

15:26.600 --> 15:29.200
Grand Marshal...I'm...

15:31.480 --> 15:33.480
..we're sorry about this.

15:33.480 --> 15:35.000
It's not what you deserve.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
'It isn't what you deserve.'

15:39.680 --> 15:41.160
Oh!

15:41.160 --> 15:42.480
Oh, great.

15:42.480 --> 15:44.560
Hey, it's OK, Clara. Keep going.

15:50.920 --> 15:53.040
You're a long way from home.

15:53.040 --> 15:55.320
5,000 years.

15:55.320 --> 15:57.360
And 5,000 years adrift in time.

15:57.360 --> 15:59.800
Please, let us help you.
You're not our enemy.

15:59.800 --> 16:04.560
And yet...I am in chains.

16:05.600 --> 16:06.960
Doctor, what do I say?

16:06.960 --> 16:08.800
Yes, Doctor.

16:08.800 --> 16:11.640
What should she say?

16:11.640 --> 16:15.760
I think he wants to speak to the
organ-grinder, not to the monkey.

16:15.760 --> 16:17.080
I heard that.

16:18.280 --> 16:20.800
You're restrained until
we can trust each other, Skaldak.

16:20.800 --> 16:22.640
You would do the same in my position

16:22.640 --> 16:25.640
and don't even think about using
that sonic weapon.

16:25.640 --> 16:27.040
'Not in the torpedo room.'

16:27.040 --> 16:32.080
I was Fleet Commander
of the Nix Tharsis.

16:32.080 --> 16:35.600
My daughter stood by me...

16:36.800 --> 16:39.800
..it was her first taste of action.

16:41.040 --> 16:46.160
We sang the songs of the Old Times.

16:46.160 --> 16:48.640
The Songs of the Red Snow.

16:49.920 --> 16:57.720
5,000 years,
now my daughter will be...dust!

16:57.720 --> 16:59.480
Only dust.

16:59.480 --> 17:01.720
'No, no, no, listen.
Your people live on, Skaldak!'

17:01.720 --> 17:03.800
Scattered all across the universe.

17:03.800 --> 17:09.200
And Mars will rise again, I promise
you. Just, let me help you.

17:09.200 --> 17:12.079
I require no help.

17:13.400 --> 17:16.400
'There will be no help!'

17:20.240 --> 17:22.480
Careful, Clara. 'I'm OK.'

17:22.480 --> 17:24.920
No listen, Clara,
don't get too close.

17:24.920 --> 17:26.319
I'm OK!

17:29.080 --> 17:31.920
Doctor, something's wrong. What?

17:33.320 --> 17:34.840
Something's...

17:37.400 --> 17:39.200
SHE GASPS

17:39.200 --> 17:40.720
It's not there! It's gone!

17:43.240 --> 17:45.760
Gone? Gone?

17:45.760 --> 17:47.960
Gone, what do you mean, gone?!
It's got out!

17:47.960 --> 17:51.960
It is time I learned
the measure of my enemies.

17:51.960 --> 17:54.840
'And what this vessel
is capable of.'

17:54.840 --> 17:56.440
No, no, no, Skaldak!

17:56.440 --> 18:00.040
Harm one of us
and you harm us all!

18:00.040 --> 18:03.440
By the Moons, this I swear!

18:03.440 --> 18:06.440
HISSING
Clara! Get out of there! GET OUT!

18:10.400 --> 18:13.000
I've never seen one do this before!

18:13.000 --> 18:17.080
Actually, I've never seen one
out of its armour before.

18:18.760 --> 18:20.800
Won't it be more vulnerable
out of its shell?

18:20.800 --> 18:23.360
No, it will be more dangerous.

18:23.360 --> 18:25.320
HISSING AND GROWLING

18:26.840 --> 18:28.720
Clara! Clara!

18:30.160 --> 18:32.640
HISSING AND GROWLING

18:35.560 --> 18:37.200
Come on!

18:38.840 --> 18:41.200
SHE GRUNTS

18:43.400 --> 18:45.000
Clara!

18:46.120 --> 18:48.120
Clara! Clara!

18:48.120 --> 18:49.400
Clara!

18:53.760 --> 18:55.120
I'm OK.

18:55.120 --> 18:57.680
Ha-ha, I'm OK, I'm OK!

18:57.680 --> 18:59.120
Where did he go?

18:59.120 --> 19:01.080
BEEPING

19:03.400 --> 19:06.480
How did I do? Was I OK?
This wasn't a test, Clara.

19:06.480 --> 19:08.480
I know but... You were great. Yeah.

19:09.480 --> 19:11.000
Really?

19:12.720 --> 19:14.720
Really.

19:14.720 --> 19:17.600
Doctor...the signal, it's stopped.

19:24.920 --> 19:28.480
Skaldak got no answer
from his Martian brothers.

19:28.480 --> 19:29.920
Now he's given up hope.

19:29.920 --> 19:32.480
Hope of what? Being rescued.

19:32.480 --> 19:34.280
He thinks he's been abandoned.

19:40.440 --> 19:42.240
He's got nothing left to lose.

19:50.120 --> 19:53.360
But what can he do stuck down
here like the rest of us?

19:53.360 --> 19:55.000
How bad can it be?

19:55.000 --> 19:57.800
This sub's stuffed with nuclear
missiles, Zhukov.

19:57.800 --> 19:58.840
It's fat with them!

19:58.840 --> 20:01.440
What do you think Skaldak's going
to do when he finds that out?

20:01.440 --> 20:04.040
"How BAD can it be?
How bad can it be?"

20:06.560 --> 20:08.120
It couldn't be any worse.

20:08.120 --> 20:10.160
BANGING AND RUMBLING

20:27.840 --> 20:31.440
OK...spoke too soon.

20:31.440 --> 20:33.760
ALARM BEEPING

20:35.920 --> 20:37.920
WATERY GROWLING

20:46.280 --> 20:48.880
Hello? Who's there?

20:58.400 --> 20:59.920
Who's there?

21:02.520 --> 21:05.200
WATERY GROWLING

21:11.680 --> 21:13.400
Who's there?!

21:13.400 --> 21:14.880
METAL CLUNKING

21:16.120 --> 21:18.360
GROWLING

21:32.600 --> 21:35.080
What do you want with me? Much.

21:38.840 --> 21:41.600
Comrades, you know our situation...

21:43.120 --> 21:47.160
..the reactor is drowned, we are
totally reliant on battery power

21:47.160 --> 21:50.000
and our air is running out.

21:50.000 --> 21:53.560
Rescue is unlikely but we still
have a mission to fulfil.

21:53.560 --> 21:55.040
If the Doctor is right,

21:55.040 --> 21:58.200
then we are all that stands
between this creature

21:58.200 --> 22:00.400
and the destruction of the world.

22:00.400 --> 22:03.040
Control of one missile
is all he needs.

22:03.040 --> 22:05.120
We are expendable, comrades...

22:05.120 --> 22:06.680
our world is not.

22:06.680 --> 22:11.560
I know I can rely on every one of
you to do his duty without fail.

22:11.560 --> 22:12.800
That is all.

22:15.960 --> 22:17.160
Listen to me...

22:20.600 --> 22:23.080
..we both understand each other...

22:23.080 --> 22:24.760
This...

22:24.760 --> 22:26.880
this mewling time of peace,
it doesn't suit us.

22:26.880 --> 22:28.600
We are both warriors...

22:30.040 --> 22:35.560
..and...together...we can
form an alliance.

22:35.560 --> 22:38.040
An alliance?

22:39.040 --> 22:40.080
Yes...

22:41.400 --> 22:43.160
..to win the Cold War!

22:43.160 --> 22:44.680
Cold War?

22:47.320 --> 22:51.960
Both sides are capable of
completely obliterating the other.

22:51.960 --> 22:55.720
It's a state we call
mutually assured destruction.

22:55.720 --> 22:59.120
Mutually assured destruction?

22:59.120 --> 23:01.160
But this has not occurred?

23:02.880 --> 23:05.800
No. Not yet.

23:09.800 --> 23:14.440
Even if a missile did get launched,
that wouldn't be...it, would it?

23:14.440 --> 23:15.520
"It"?

23:15.520 --> 23:17.040
End of the world. Game over.

23:17.040 --> 23:20.160
I mean, what if they fired one by
accident, what would happen then?

23:20.160 --> 23:23.000
I told you, Clara. Earth is like
a storm waiting to break, right now.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.440
Both sides baring their teeth,
talking up war.

23:25.440 --> 23:26.960
It would only take one tiny spark.

23:26.960 --> 23:29.960
But the world didn't end in 1983,
did it? Or I wouldn't be here.

23:29.960 --> 23:33.480
New. History's in flux.
It can be changed.

23:33.480 --> 23:34.760
Re-written.

23:39.160 --> 23:40.480
How many of us are left?

23:40.480 --> 23:42.640
12 - and we can't find Stepashin.

23:44.600 --> 23:46.160
We split up and comb the sub.

23:46.160 --> 23:48.120
One team stays here
to guard the bridge.

23:48.120 --> 23:49.720
That's it? That's the plan?

23:49.720 --> 23:53.880
Well, it's either that or we stay
here and wait for him to kill us.

23:53.880 --> 23:54.920
OK.

23:56.800 --> 23:59.560
Is it true you've never seen one
outside of its shell suit?

23:59.560 --> 24:01.000
"Shell suit"?

24:01.000 --> 24:02.640
(Clara!)

24:02.640 --> 24:05.520
For an Ice Warrior to leave
its armour is the gravest dishonour.

24:05.520 --> 24:09.520
Skaldak is desperate, he is deadly
and we have got to find him.

24:09.520 --> 24:11.320
Will this help?

24:11.320 --> 24:13.040
Ah! You saved it!

24:13.040 --> 24:15.880
No, no, it was on the floor
with this. Ah!

24:15.880 --> 24:19.120
Ah, Professor, I could kiss you!

24:19.120 --> 24:20.280
If you insist.

24:21.400 --> 24:22.440
Later.

24:28.920 --> 24:31.040
CREAKING

24:33.480 --> 24:35.600
Do you think it's true, sir?

24:36.760 --> 24:38.360
A Martian?!

24:40.480 --> 24:42.080
I don't know what to think.

24:50.160 --> 24:53.080
So, why have you got a cattle prod
on a submarine?

24:53.080 --> 24:55.200
Polar bears. Ah, right.

24:55.200 --> 24:58.040
We run across them when
we're drilling.

24:58.040 --> 25:00.440
Can be quite nasty, you know?

25:00.440 --> 25:03.560
I'd swap one for an Ice Warrior
any day. Cuddlier!

25:04.760 --> 25:06.520
Courage, my dear.

25:06.520 --> 25:07.720
ALARM BEEPING

25:07.720 --> 25:09.840
I always sing a song.

25:09.840 --> 25:10.960
What?

25:10.960 --> 25:12.720
To keep my spirits up.

25:12.720 --> 25:14.680
Yes, that would work...

25:14.680 --> 25:16.640
if this was Pinocchio.

KLAXON BLARING

25:18.120 --> 25:20.120
D'you know Hungry Like The Wolf?

25:20.120 --> 25:23.720
What? Duran Duran -
one of my favourites.

25:23.720 --> 25:24.800
Come on!

25:24.800 --> 25:26.480
I'm not singing a song!

25:38.520 --> 25:39.920
What was that?

25:39.920 --> 25:43.040
Pressure. Just pressure.

25:43.040 --> 25:45.080
We're 700 metres down, remember?

25:45.080 --> 25:47.880
Don't worry about it.
Think of something else.

25:49.320 --> 25:53.360
# Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da

25:53.360 --> 25:56.240
# I am hungry like the wolf. #

25:56.240 --> 25:58.480
I'm not singing! Don't you know it?

25:58.480 --> 26:01.200
Course I know it.
We do it at karaoke.

26:01.200 --> 26:02.520
The odd hen night.

26:02.520 --> 26:04.960
"Karaoke"? "Hen night"?

26:06.840 --> 26:09.160
You speak excellent
Russian, my dear,

26:09.160 --> 26:12.720
but sometimes I don't understand
a word you're talking about.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.600
If we get out of here,
we'll be bloody heroes!

26:19.640 --> 26:21.480
If we get out of here.

26:21.480 --> 26:25.000
The first people in the world
to discover a genuine, living...

26:25.000 --> 26:26.160
Alien?

26:27.240 --> 26:30.680
I don't know.
You hear stories, don't you?

26:32.160 --> 26:35.400
Stories about the things
the Kremlin don't want us to...

27:11.080 --> 27:13.560
It's a monster. A savage!

27:13.560 --> 27:20.400
No, Professor. Not savage, forensic.
Well, he's...dismantled them.

27:21.680 --> 27:25.120
Skaldak's learning.
Learning all about you.

27:25.120 --> 27:27.440
Your strengths...

27:27.440 --> 27:28.920
your weaknesses...

27:30.000 --> 27:32.240
Come on!

27:45.880 --> 27:47.640
Stay here. OK.

27:47.640 --> 27:50.480
Stay here! Don't argue. I'm not!

27:50.480 --> 27:53.560
Right. Good!

27:55.360 --> 27:58.120
It's a young man's game,
all this dashing about!

28:07.800 --> 28:11.440
Clara...what is it?

28:11.440 --> 28:12.800
I was doing OK.

28:14.720 --> 28:17.400
I mean, I went in there and did
the scary stuff, didn't I?

28:17.400 --> 28:20.480
I went in there with the Ice Warrior
and it went OK.

28:20.480 --> 28:25.640
Actually, it went just about as badly
as it could have done but that
wasn't my fault. Not at all.

28:25.640 --> 28:27.360
So, I'm happy about that. Yes!

28:28.960 --> 28:30.400
Chuffed.

28:30.400 --> 28:31.760
And so you should be.

28:35.560 --> 28:36.800
So what's the matter?

28:38.160 --> 28:40.200
Seeing those bodies back there...

28:42.600 --> 28:45.200
..it's all got very...real.

28:47.640 --> 28:49.520
Are we going to make it?

Yes, of course.

29:32.560 --> 29:35.400
Oh...oh...oh!

29:35.400 --> 29:37.480
Fast. He's fast...

29:38.800 --> 29:40.880
WATERY GROWLING

29:42.200 --> 29:43.840
EERIE GROANING

29:45.160 --> 29:47.200
What was that?

29:47.200 --> 29:50.080
The Doctor told you,
it's just the boat settling.

29:53.480 --> 29:55.040
Tell me about yourself.

29:56.120 --> 29:57.480
What do you like doing?

29:58.880 --> 30:00.080
Clara?

30:00.080 --> 30:01.680
METALLIC RATTLING

30:03.000 --> 30:06.080
Clara? Stuff. You know, stuff.

30:06.080 --> 30:09.560
"Stuff"? Very enlightening.

30:09.560 --> 30:12.680
And the Doctor, what he said,
is it true?

30:12.680 --> 30:15.440
You're...from another time...

30:16.840 --> 30:18.560
..from our future?

30:18.560 --> 30:20.000
Clara?

30:20.000 --> 30:21.920
Yes. Tell me what happens.

30:21.920 --> 30:23.760
I can't. Well, I need to know.

30:23.760 --> 30:25.280
I'm not allowed. No, please.

30:25.280 --> 30:28.080
I can't! Ultravox, do they split up?

30:30.880 --> 30:33.400
SHE LAUGHS

30:35.320 --> 30:37.440
Funny. You're funny!

30:37.440 --> 30:39.800
SHE GASPS

30:39.800 --> 30:41.160
Let her go!

30:45.680 --> 30:47.440
See...

30:47.440 --> 30:49.440
I don't just like Western music!

30:50.760 --> 30:53.120
No, please, don't hurt him. Please!

30:53.120 --> 30:55.720
You attacked me!

30:55.720 --> 31:00.680
Martian Law decree's that the people
of this planet are forfeit.

31:01.680 --> 31:05.320
I now have all
the information I require.

31:05.320 --> 31:08.880
It will take only one missile
to begin the process.

31:08.880 --> 31:11.280
To end this...Cold War.

31:11.280 --> 31:14.800
Grand Marshal, there is no need
for this. Listen to me...

31:14.800 --> 31:19.240
My distress call has not been
answered. It will never be answered.

31:19.240 --> 31:22.160
My people are dead. They are dust.

31:22.160 --> 31:25.800
There is nothing left for me
except my revenge.

31:25.800 --> 31:27.880
HE ROARS

31:28.920 --> 31:30.840
BEEPING

31:36.720 --> 31:39.920
There is something left for you,
Skaldak. Mercy.

31:39.920 --> 31:42.600
Mercy? You must wear that armour
for a reason, my friend.

31:42.600 --> 31:44.480
Let's see, shall we?
No, Captain, wait!

31:44.480 --> 31:47.000
I will do whatever it takes
to defend my world, Doctor.

31:47.000 --> 31:50.000
Yes, great, fine, good, but we're
getting somewhere here.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.640
We're negotiating,
"jaw-jaw not war-war".

31:52.640 --> 31:53.880
Churchill? Churchill.

31:53.880 --> 31:57.520
Very well, we'll negotiate
but from a position of strength.

31:57.520 --> 32:01.640
Excellent tactical thinking,
my congratulations, Captain.

32:01.640 --> 32:02.960
Thank you.

32:02.960 --> 32:06.280
Unfortunately, your position
is not, perhaps,

32:06.280 --> 32:09.040
as strong as you might hope.

32:11.840 --> 32:13.200
What do you mean?

32:29.320 --> 32:31.160
He summoned the armour.

32:31.160 --> 32:33.280
How did it do that?
Sonic tech, Clara.

32:33.280 --> 32:34.920
The song of the Ice Warrior!

32:37.560 --> 32:42.480
My world is dead but now there
will be a second red planet!

32:42.480 --> 32:46.080
Red with the blood of humanity!

32:46.080 --> 32:47.840
Skaldak! Wait!

33:11.560 --> 33:13.800
KLAXON BLARING

33:21.040 --> 33:23.840
No! Skaldak! Wait! Wait! Wait!

33:23.840 --> 33:25.000
He's arming the warheads!

33:25.000 --> 33:28.360
Where is the honour in condemning
billions of innocents to death?

33:28.360 --> 33:31.320
5,000 years ago Mars was the centre
of a vast empire.

33:31.320 --> 33:33.440
The jewel of this solar system.

33:33.440 --> 33:36.000
The people of Earth had only just
begun to leave their caves.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.080
Five thousand years isn't
such a long time,

33:38.080 --> 33:41.320
they're still just frightened
children. Still primitive.

33:41.320 --> 33:42.840
Who are you to judge them?

33:44.360 --> 33:49.240
I am Skaldak! This planet
is forfeit under Martian Law.

33:49.240 --> 33:51.880
Then teach them!
Teach them, Grand Marshal!

33:51.880 --> 33:53.600
Show them another way!

33:53.600 --> 33:55.760
Show them there is honour in mercy.

33:55.760 --> 33:58.960
Is this how you want history
to remember you?

33:58.960 --> 34:02.720
Grand Marshal Skaldak -
Destroyer of Earth?

34:02.720 --> 34:05.360
Because that's what you'll be
if you send those missiles.

34:05.360 --> 34:07.880
Not a soldier...a murderer.

34:07.880 --> 34:10.679
Five billion lives extinguished.
No chance for goodbyes.

34:10.679 --> 34:13.080
A world snuffed out like
a candle flame!

34:13.080 --> 34:15.040
All right, all right, Skaldak,

34:15.040 --> 34:17.719
you leave me no choice.
I'm a Time Lord, Skaldak.

34:17.719 --> 34:21.800
I know a bit about sonic
technology myself.

34:21.800 --> 34:25.360
A threat? YOU threaten me, Doctor?

34:25.360 --> 34:28.600
No. No, not you...

34:28.600 --> 34:29.639
all of us.

34:30.920 --> 34:32.880
I will blow this sub up

34:32.880 --> 34:36.040
before you can even reach that
button, Grand Marshal.

34:36.040 --> 34:37.360
Blow us all to oblivion.

34:37.360 --> 34:39.600
You would sacrifice yourself?

34:41.719 --> 34:43.280
In a heartbeat.

34:45.239 --> 34:47.960
Mutually assured destruction!

34:49.000 --> 34:51.520
Look into my eye, Skaldak.

34:51.520 --> 34:56.280
Look in to my eyes and tell me
you're capable of doing this.

34:56.280 --> 34:57.960
Huh?

34:57.960 --> 35:00.120
Can you do that?

35:00.120 --> 35:01.520
DARE you do that?

35:02.920 --> 35:07.280
Look into my eyes, Skaldak,
come on! Face-to-face.

35:08.680 --> 35:10.720
Well, Doctor...

35:18.240 --> 35:22.360
..which of us shall blink first?

35:25.160 --> 35:28.840
Why did you hesitate?
Back there, in the dark.

35:29.880 --> 35:31.720
You were going to kill
this man, remember?

35:31.720 --> 35:33.280
I begged you not to and you listened.

35:33.280 --> 35:36.680
Why show compassion then,
Skaldak, and not now?

35:38.520 --> 35:41.520
The Doctor's right...billions
will die...

35:42.800 --> 35:46.480
..mothers, sons,
fathers...daughters.

35:46.480 --> 35:49.640
Remember that last battle, Skaldak?

35:49.640 --> 35:51.960
Your daughter...

35:51.960 --> 35:54.040
you sang the songs...

35:54.040 --> 35:57.200
Of the Red Snows.

35:57.200 --> 35:59.480
CRASHING

36:00.680 --> 36:02.320
What's happening?!

36:02.320 --> 36:04.520
ELECTRONIC WHINING

36:06.760 --> 36:09.080
RUMBLING

36:17.960 --> 36:22.680
My people live,
they have come for me!

36:29.840 --> 36:31.640
CREAKING

36:31.640 --> 36:33.880
We're rising.

36:33.880 --> 36:35.120
We're rising!

36:36.600 --> 36:37.640
600 metres...

36:40.880 --> 36:42.760
..550...

36:42.760 --> 36:44.920
ELECTRONIC WHIRRING

36:57.400 --> 37:00.960
We're surfaced,
your people have saved us.

37:00.960 --> 37:03.320
Saved me, not you.

37:03.320 --> 37:04.880
Just go, Skaldak, please.

37:06.240 --> 37:08.800
Please...go in peace.

37:17.760 --> 37:21.440
ALARM BEEPING
We did it! We did it!

37:21.440 --> 37:25.240
No. No, no, no, no, no!
It's still armed.

37:25.240 --> 37:28.840
A single pulse from that ship...

37:28.840 --> 37:30.560
I'll destroy us if I have to.

37:30.560 --> 37:32.360
I will destroy us if I have to.

37:34.360 --> 37:36.680
Show mercy, Skaldak.

37:36.680 --> 37:38.720
(Come on, show mercy.)

37:40.400 --> 37:42.280
# Da-da-da-dah

37:42.280 --> 37:47.200
# I'm lost and I'm found
and I'm hungry like the wolf. #

37:59.840 --> 38:01.160
Now we're safe.

38:07.880 --> 38:09.720
Ha-ha!

38:13.720 --> 38:15.280
Ahem.

38:15.280 --> 38:16.960
Saved the world then?

38:16.960 --> 38:18.160
Yeah.

38:19.160 --> 38:20.880
That's what we do.

38:22.720 --> 38:24.200
Yeah.

38:25.320 --> 38:27.360
METAL CLUNKING

38:37.760 --> 38:40.120
MAN WHISTLES

38:43.880 --> 38:46.800
WHIRRING

38:50.640 --> 38:53.720
The TARDIS! Where's the TARDIS?
You never explained.

38:53.720 --> 38:56.960
Oh, well, don't worry about that.
Stop saying that! Where is it?

38:56.960 --> 38:59.680
Yeah, well, I wasn't to know, was I?

38:59.680 --> 39:01.240
Know what?

39:01.240 --> 39:04.120
I've been
tinkering...breaking her in.

39:04.120 --> 39:05.840
I'm allowed. What did you do?

39:06.880 --> 39:08.760
(I reset the HADS!)

39:08.760 --> 39:13.640
Huh? I reset (the HADS!) The
Hostile Action Displacement System!

39:13.640 --> 39:18.000
If the TARDIS comes under attack,
gunfire, time-winds, the...sea,

39:18.000 --> 39:21.040
it...relocates.

39:22.120 --> 39:23.480
Oh, Doctor.

39:24.480 --> 39:26.000
Haven't used it in donkey's years.

39:26.000 --> 39:28.280
Seemed like a good idea at the time.

39:28.280 --> 39:31.480
Well, never mind,
it's bound to turn up somewhere!
BUZZING

39:31.480 --> 39:34.880
Oh! Ha, see, right on cue!
Brilliant!

39:34.880 --> 39:36.160
Brilliant!

39:36.160 --> 39:38.800
The TARDIS is at the Pole!

39:38.800 --> 39:40.760
Not far then.

39:40.760 --> 39:42.240
The South Pole.

39:43.320 --> 39:45.360
Ah.

39:45.360 --> 39:46.960
Could we have a lift?

39:46.960 --> 39:49.520
THEY LAUGH

39:50.600 --> 39:52.760
"Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!"

40:15.720 --> 40:19.160
I am talking to the spirit
that inhabits this house.

40:19.160 --> 40:20.760
Spooky.

40:20.760 --> 40:22.840
You didn't come here for
the ghost, did you?

40:22.840 --> 40:25.760
Clara, where is she?

40:27.040 --> 40:29.800
(Do you feel like you
are being watched?)

40:29.800 --> 40:32.280
(Are you coming? Where?
To find the ghost?)

40:33.560 --> 40:35.560
Doctor!

40:35.560 --> 40:41.200
The Caliburn Ghast, the Maiden
in the Dark, the Witch of the Well.

40:41.200 --> 40:42.800
(She's Coming.)

40:42.800 --> 40:44.160
I think she's here.
