01:55.364 --> 01:58.242
Hey, Einstein, you got an order up.

01:58.326 --> 01:59.452
Sorry, Nat.

02:03.456 --> 02:04.707
Here you go.

02:10.003 --> 02:11.964
Mr Danzel. Hi.

02:13.758 --> 02:16.969
I'm in your American history class.
Brandon Walsh.

02:19.305 --> 02:21.182
You know, this is wild.
I was just right over there,

02:21.265 --> 02:23.517
- studying for the test tomorrow.
- Good luck.

02:24.518 --> 02:27.271
Oh, I'm not too worried about it.
History's my favorite subject.

02:27.354 --> 02:30.024
Fine.
Would you bring some horseradish?

02:30.774 --> 02:32.234
Sure, no problem.

02:36.363 --> 02:39.783
- Want to hear the strangest thing?
- What's that?

02:40.200 --> 02:42.619
The guy over there in the corner
is one of my teachers.

02:43.245 --> 02:44.288
Danzel?

02:44.371 --> 02:46.540
- You know him?
- Yeah, he's a regular.

02:46.665 --> 02:49.793
- Don't let him get to you, kid.
- Oh, he doesn't bother me.

03:07.269 --> 03:12.399
I grade on a curve. 10% A's, 10% F's.
The remaining 80% get C's.

03:12.774 --> 03:15.360
C for average, C for mediocrity,

03:15.652 --> 03:18.363
C for just getting by.

03:20.490 --> 03:22.451
God, who dresses him?

03:22.951 --> 03:26.371
There'll be another quiz next Friday
and every Friday.

03:26.997 --> 03:28.957
Thanks, Mr Danzel.

03:30.584 --> 03:33.295
- Thanks.
- Love the tie. Yeah, great.

03:35.964 --> 03:37.090
Yes, what is it?

03:37.507 --> 03:40.886
Some of the people who made C's
only missed three or four questions.

03:40.969 --> 03:43.054
Those who got A's
only missed one or two.

03:43.138 --> 03:45.515
That's the difference between
the pursuit of excellence

03:45.599 --> 03:47.601
and a morass of mediocrity.

03:52.814 --> 03:54.899
History used to be my favorite subject.

03:54.983 --> 03:57.527
Yeah, the guy gives new meaning
to the word hemorrhoid.

03:58.069 --> 04:00.280
- What'd you get, Steve?
- What do you think?

04:00.363 --> 04:01.406
Oh, I hate you.

04:01.489 --> 04:03.700
- You got an A?
- Yeah.

04:07.287 --> 04:10.290
Steve is such a brain
when it comes to history,

04:10.790 --> 04:13.001
and a total sub-mental
in everything else.

04:13.460 --> 04:14.586
Bye.

04:15.295 --> 04:17.797
Hey, don't forget I need the story
on the swim team by Wednesday.

04:17.880 --> 04:20.048
Hey, the swim team's fine.
I'm the one that's drowning.

04:20.132 --> 04:21.384
Well, strap on a life preserver,

04:21.466 --> 04:24.304
and get it to me before the meet
with Beverly Hills High.

04:25.346 --> 04:28.308
Come on, Andrea.
I got three tests next week.

04:28.391 --> 04:29.976
Welcome to West Beverly High.

04:30.059 --> 04:31.978
It's easy for you to say,
you don't have a job.

04:32.061 --> 04:33.771
You think running a paper is a picnic?

04:33.855 --> 04:36.024
Well, you're just too good to be true,
aren't you?

04:36.107 --> 04:37.900
Okay, I will give the swim team
to somebody else.

04:37.984 --> 04:40.278
You know, you don't have to get
so nasty just 'cause you got a C.

04:40.361 --> 04:42.029
Look, what are grades anyway?

04:42.155 --> 04:44.615
I mean, they're just some weird,
arbitrary reference points

04:44.699 --> 04:46.951
that can't measure
what a person really knows.

04:50.121 --> 04:54.000
I've never gotten a C before in my life,
especially in history.

04:54.083 --> 04:57.879
Well, maybe we could study
for the next quiz together.

04:58.296 --> 05:00.923
If you want. It's no big deal.

05:01.173 --> 05:03.009
I suppose you got an A?

05:03.509 --> 05:06.721
What are grades, anyway? Bye.

05:16.772 --> 05:19.483
What I would do
to go out with Dylan McKay.

05:19.567 --> 05:21.694
I don't know,
everyone says he's trouble.

05:21.777 --> 05:24.280
Well, he can trouble me all he wants.

05:27.116 --> 05:29.368
- Hey, Dylan.
- Hey, Kelly.

05:29.910 --> 05:31.620
Brenda and I were just talking.

05:31.704 --> 05:34.707
What do you think guys like best
on girls, long or short hair?

05:34.790 --> 05:39.420
That's a deep question.
Personally, I prefer blondes.

05:40.129 --> 05:43.507
- Really?
- Really. Truly.

05:45.259 --> 05:50.055
- So, you're Brandon's sister, huh?
- Yeah, I'm Brandon's sister.

05:57.646 --> 05:59.648
Yeah, she's Brandon's sister.

06:00.899 --> 06:02.276
Bye, girls.

06:05.737 --> 06:08.824
- He's so weird.
- Yeah.

06:46.153 --> 06:48.572
I've always had a thing for blondes.

06:50.323 --> 06:53.451
- Mom, you scared me.
- Honey, you're beautiful.

06:53.660 --> 06:56.788
- Not California beautiful.
- Brenda.

06:57.497 --> 07:00.583
- Hey, hon. Hey, Bren.
- Hey, Dad.

07:00.667 --> 07:03.712
- I've got to do something with my hair.
- What's wrong with your hair?

07:03.962 --> 07:05.171
Everything.

07:06.798 --> 07:08.049
Welcome home.

07:08.383 --> 07:12.262
- Where's the other half?
- He's upstairs studying with Andrea.

07:12.387 --> 07:14.055
Andrea?

07:27.902 --> 07:29.279
Sorry about that.

07:30.238 --> 07:31.406
So where were we?

07:31.531 --> 07:33.783
The Cherokee Nation.

07:34.158 --> 07:38.413
Right. Okay, who instigated
the Indian Removal Act,

07:38.496 --> 07:42.625
- and what year was it put in service?
- Andrew Jackson. 1828.

07:43.334 --> 07:45.211
- Wrong.
- What do you mean wrong?

07:45.294 --> 07:46.462
I mean wrong.

07:46.671 --> 07:49.340
The Georgia Legislature
confiscated the Cherokee land

07:49.424 --> 07:50.967
when they found the gold.

07:51.467 --> 07:54.679
- What are you yelling at me for?
- I'm not yelling at you.

07:55.388 --> 07:57.473
It's just irritating how you always think
you're right.

07:57.598 --> 07:59.725
I am right. Jackson was President.

07:59.809 --> 08:01.811
He's the one who pushed the bill
through Congress,

08:01.894 --> 08:04.647
he's the one
who's ultimately responsible.

08:08.901 --> 08:11.570
- Knock, knock.
- Hey, Dad.

08:11.696 --> 08:14.865
This is Andrea Zuckerman.
Andrea Zuckerman, this is my father.

08:14.949 --> 08:16.575
- Hi.
- Hi.

08:16.826 --> 08:19.120
- So, what you studying?
- American history.

08:19.453 --> 08:21.831
Don't worry.
That's Brandon's best subject.

08:24.083 --> 08:26.127
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too.

08:31.340 --> 08:33.592
This is impossible.
There's too much to cover.

08:33.759 --> 08:36.720
Look, it's not that difficult, Brandon.

08:37.263 --> 08:40.099
Just memorize
when the Great Migration took place.

08:40.182 --> 08:43.227
- Why do you say it like that?
- Say what like what?

08:43.352 --> 08:44.895
"It's not that difficult, Brandon."

08:44.979 --> 08:47.398
You act like I have a learning disability
or something.

08:47.481 --> 08:50.818
I'm sorry.
I didn't realize you were so sensitive.

08:50.901 --> 08:52.278
It's not me.

08:52.403 --> 08:54.822
You're the one who's so
condescending and businesslike.

08:54.905 --> 08:56.281
It drives me up the wall.

08:57.991 --> 09:00.077
- Good luck, Brandon.
- Where are you going?

09:00.494 --> 09:03.831
- This obviously isn't working out.
- You're right.

09:03.914 --> 09:06.291
Fine. It was a bad idea. I'll walk you out.

09:06.375 --> 09:07.876
Oh no, I can find the door, Brandon.

09:07.960 --> 09:10.879
Us "businesslike" types
are real good at things like that.

09:15.092 --> 09:16.677
Way to go, Romeo.

09:32.275 --> 09:34.111
- Hey, where you going?
- Down the tubes.

09:34.194 --> 09:36.238
Another victim
of the Danzel curve, huh?

09:36.321 --> 09:38.031
- Did you get another A?
- Yeah.

09:38.782 --> 09:40.325
God, my dad's going to kill me, man.

09:40.409 --> 09:43.078
Just tell him Danzel gets his kicks
out of ruining people's GPA.

09:43.161 --> 09:44.538
It doesn't work with him. He graduated

09:44.621 --> 09:46.623
Phi Beta Kappa,
summa cum, something.

09:46.706 --> 09:48.458
Never lets anyone forget it.

09:48.542 --> 09:51.211
Maybe I can help you out.
We'll form a study group.

09:58.843 --> 10:01.596
For some reason,
this doesn't seem like studying.

10:02.055 --> 10:03.974
It's all the same to me, Brandon.

10:04.849 --> 10:07.936
- Nice house, man.
- This is nothing.

10:08.019 --> 10:11.022
You should have seen where I used
to live before my parents got divorced.

10:11.106 --> 10:13.525
- When was that?
- Which time?

10:14.234 --> 10:18.071
- They divorced each other twice?
- Oh, amongst other things.

10:18.279 --> 10:19.697
There've been
other marriages mixed in,

10:19.781 --> 10:22.200
other kids, other houses, you know.

10:23.618 --> 10:27.330
- What, your parents are still together?
- Yeah.

10:28.456 --> 10:32.669
Well, look, it's not your fault.
You've got to stop blaming yourself.

10:35.838 --> 10:40.009
All right, anyway,
what method did the government use

10:40.093 --> 10:42.637
to undermine the tribal structure?

10:42.720 --> 10:45.556
- He's not gonna ask that.
- Land allotment.

10:45.765 --> 10:48.309
The government detribalized everything
by giving every Indian

10:48.393 --> 10:49.811
a little piece of land.

10:50.019 --> 10:52.021
Hey, you wanna go
to the Laker-Piston game next week?

10:52.105 --> 10:53.314
- You can get tickets?
- Well, yeah.

10:53.398 --> 10:55.566
My father gave me season tickets
for my birthday.

10:55.650 --> 10:58.486
All I got was a steak dinner
and a couple of striped shirts.

10:58.569 --> 11:00.947
Oh, I get great presents
ever since my dad moved out.

11:01.030 --> 11:04.116
You know, if I can keep my average
where it is now, I'll be a Trojan.

11:04.200 --> 11:05.910
My father's on the board at SC.

11:05.993 --> 11:08.829
Well, with your grades, you shouldn't
have any trouble getting in.

11:10.623 --> 11:14.168
You're a good guy, Brandon.
I don't say that to many people.

11:14.877 --> 11:16.671
In fact, I don't say that to anybody.

11:19.048 --> 11:21.217
Well, you're a good guy, too, Steve.

11:23.344 --> 11:27.807
Okay, name the five tribes that made up
the Confederacy

11:27.890 --> 11:31.185
whose primary aim
was universal, perpetual peace.

11:32.103 --> 11:34.188
The Confederacy? I...

11:36.107 --> 11:37.775
I don't think we covered that.

11:38.651 --> 11:40.611
Memorize it, Brandon. Trust me.

11:40.694 --> 11:43.739
It's exactly the kind of question
the hemorrhoid likes to ask.

11:55.876 --> 11:58.462
<i>Name the five tribes that made up
the Confederacy</i>

11:58.545 --> 12:01.757
<i>whose primary aim
was universal, perpetual peace.</i>

12:16.647 --> 12:19.733
Amazing how we happened to study
for every single question on the test.

12:19.817 --> 12:21.777
- Isn't that the point?
- You stole the test, didn't you?

12:21.860 --> 12:25.447
- Right. I happen to be smart, Brandon.
- I know, but you couldn't possibly...

12:25.531 --> 12:29.660
Look, relax.
It's supposed to feel good to ace a test.

12:33.538 --> 12:34.790
You believe that quiz?

12:34.873 --> 12:38.669
As if he ever mentioned which tribes
belonged to the Iroquois Confederacy.

12:38.752 --> 12:42.506
Mohawks, the Senecas, the Oneidas,
Cayugas, and Onondagas.

12:46.968 --> 12:49.304
Come on, Steve.
I need you to be honest with me, man.

12:49.387 --> 12:52.641
- You stole a copy of the test, didn't you?
- You knew what I was doing.

12:52.724 --> 12:55.310
- No, but in the hall you said that you...
- What was I gonna do?

12:55.393 --> 12:59.272
Make an announcement on KWBH?
"Hi, everybody, this is Steve Sanders.

12:59.356 --> 13:01.274
"I confess I stole the test."

13:01.775 --> 13:03.777
Man, you should be thanking me.

13:04.527 --> 13:06.947
I can get expelled for having this.

13:08.949 --> 13:10.867
This is next week's quiz!

13:11.576 --> 13:13.620
Actually, it's a copy of next week's quiz.

13:13.703 --> 13:15.955
The original's still tucked away
in Danzel's desk.

13:16.039 --> 13:19.501
- How did you get this?
- Bribery, larceny, grand theft,

13:19.584 --> 13:21.294
your basic tools of the trade.

13:21.836 --> 13:23.546
But don't worry.
We're not gonna get caught.

13:23.630 --> 13:27.008
- Yeah, that's what every criminal says.
- Come on, it's a quiz!

13:27.258 --> 13:30.178
- This doesn't bother you at all, does it?
- It's your decision,

13:30.386 --> 13:34.349
but I'm not gonna let some fossil
in a leisure suit ruin my GPA.

13:38.019 --> 13:40.313
- It's just a quiz, right?
- Right.

13:40.396 --> 13:42.899
And just another A on the Danzel curve.

13:58.748 --> 14:00.708
Brenda, I'm sorry,
but that is not a hairdo,

14:00.792 --> 14:01.834
that's a hair-don't.

14:01.918 --> 14:03.920
Stop it, Kelly,
you're making her hairophobic.

14:04.003 --> 14:06.631
You know, she's right. I hate it.
The color, the cut, the everything.

14:06.714 --> 14:08.508
So, change it.
It's not like there's some law

14:08.591 --> 14:10.092
that says you have to keep the things
you don't like.

14:10.176 --> 14:13.513
Brenda, my mom goes to this great guy.
He barely speaks English,

14:13.596 --> 14:16.224
has a pony tail
and this really hairy chest.

14:16.307 --> 14:17.975
Oh, and he does Madonna.

14:18.059 --> 14:19.852
Get real, Donna.
You'll never get her in there.

14:19.936 --> 14:22.146
Go to Troy Russo on Rodeo.
He'll do anybody.

14:22.229 --> 14:24.482
And he's real New Age.
He cuts hair intuitively.

14:24.565 --> 14:28.152
- Well, how much does he cost?
- Color and cut, 300 bucks.

14:28.277 --> 14:30.112
I can't afford that.

14:30.738 --> 14:32.656
Oh, how embarrassing.

14:34.241 --> 14:37.119
I'm wearing both contacts
on the same eye!

14:38.954 --> 14:40.831
And you thought you had problems.

14:46.420 --> 14:49.548
Nat, Danzel just walked in.
He's sitting in my section,

14:49.632 --> 14:51.258
I really don't wanna deal with him.

14:51.342 --> 14:53.761
Brandon, you can't keep running away
from the guy.

14:53.844 --> 14:55.137
Why not?

14:55.763 --> 14:57.765
Because he's a paying customer.

15:04.980 --> 15:07.775
Here's your dinner, Mr Danzel,
and your horseradish.

15:07.858 --> 15:09.902
How are you this evening, Mr Walsh?

15:11.403 --> 15:13.447
Fine, just fine.

15:13.655 --> 15:17.201
- You did quite well on last Friday's quiz.
- Really?

15:18.660 --> 15:20.245
Can I have another drop?

15:21.288 --> 15:23.707
Sure, no problem.

15:25.209 --> 15:28.462
Those of you who find
the Danzel curve unfair

15:28.587 --> 15:32.174
may be encouraged by
the resurrection of Brandon Walsh.

15:32.424 --> 15:34.092
Not only did he get an A,

15:34.176 --> 15:37.679
he is the only one of you philistines
who didn't miss a single question.

15:38.180 --> 15:39.222
Way to go, Brandon.

15:39.306 --> 15:41.516
Absolutely. Kudos are in order.

15:54.821 --> 15:57.157
Looks like I should be the one
asking you to help me study.

15:57.240 --> 16:00.368
- I aced one test. Big deal.
- It is a big deal.

16:00.619 --> 16:02.037
You completely loused up the curve.

16:02.120 --> 16:04.414
- Why? What'd you get?
- A "C".

16:04.831 --> 16:05.916
Ouch.

16:05.999 --> 16:10.378
Yeah, well, it's goodbye Yale.
Hello, West Beverly Junior College.

16:12.464 --> 16:14.883
Anyway, I was thinking

16:14.966 --> 16:17.719
maybe we could try
studying together again.

16:18.219 --> 16:19.346
I don't know.

16:19.429 --> 16:22.182
Look, I know things got
kind of competitive last time,

16:22.265 --> 16:23.683
but there's so much to cover.

16:23.767 --> 16:27.729
Andrea, I just don't think
it's a really good idea right now.

16:27.812 --> 16:29.272
I'm sorry.

16:45.455 --> 16:47.582
If you can change you hair,
you can change your life.

16:47.665 --> 16:51.336
Spending $300 to change something
which is already beautiful and healthy,

16:51.419 --> 16:52.879
it's just insane.

16:52.962 --> 16:55.256
Well, then I guess every girl
at West Beverly is insane.

16:55.340 --> 16:58.217
Well, if they're spending hundreds
on haircuts, they sure are.

16:58.301 --> 17:00.178
Who said anything
about a haircut, Mom?

17:00.345 --> 17:03.890
I'm talking about a perm or extensions
or maybe even a great weave.

17:03.973 --> 17:06.893
- Don't you dare.
- Why not?

17:06.976 --> 17:09.520
Honey, the people that do
those things to themselves

17:09.604 --> 17:11.689
just want to look the way you already do.

17:12.732 --> 17:16.109
- In other words, I have to stay boring.
- For $300, yes.

17:16.194 --> 17:17.694
I'm sorry, but you do.

17:18.488 --> 17:19.530
Hey.

17:19.739 --> 17:22.491
- So, genius, how'd it go today?
- Pretty good.

17:22.657 --> 17:24.242
I got an A on my history quiz.

17:24.535 --> 17:28.455
This is no ordinary A, Mother.
This is a monumental achievement.

17:28.539 --> 17:30.750
- Bren.
- Brandon, don't be so modest.

17:30.833 --> 17:33.669
- Danzel's a total Nazi.
- Nice work, kiddo.

17:34.170 --> 17:37.173
- It was just a quiz. It's no big deal.
- What's no big deal?

17:37.256 --> 17:40.134
- Brandon got an A on his history quiz.
- Hey, that's great.

17:40.217 --> 17:42.303
- Not that I'm surprised.
- Thanks.

17:47.516 --> 17:49.894
I told you that C was an aberration.

17:50.186 --> 17:52.813
It's just taking him a little extra time
to get adjusted,

17:53.147 --> 17:55.482
but Brandon has always been
a terrific student,

17:55.566 --> 17:59.236
and he's going to make the honor roll
even if I have to take his tests for him.

17:59.320 --> 18:00.696
Oh, stop.

18:09.163 --> 18:10.205
Hi.

18:10.914 --> 18:13.500
Don't tell me, another Danzel special.

18:13.584 --> 18:15.002
I hate that guy.

18:15.544 --> 18:17.755
Does everyone hate Danzel
as much as you do?

18:18.005 --> 18:19.423
It's unanimous.

18:19.590 --> 18:21.842
So, who else is in this class, anyway?

18:22.593 --> 18:25.637
I don't know,
Andrea, Donna, Steve Sanders...

18:25.721 --> 18:29.266
- Dylan McKay?
- No, he's too smart to take this class.

18:29.933 --> 18:31.810
Or too busy chasing blondes.

18:33.187 --> 18:34.479
What are you talking about?

18:34.563 --> 18:37.149
I just don't understand why every
guy's dream girl has to have hair

18:37.232 --> 18:39.318
like Daryl Hannah
and a body like Kim Basinger.

18:39.401 --> 18:42.821
- Bren! I'm trying to study here.
- Well, excuse me for living.

18:49.119 --> 18:52.414
Here, don't spend it all in one place
or on one face.

18:52.539 --> 18:53.665
Thanks, Nat.

18:53.749 --> 18:57.627
- Hey, hey, are you okay, kid?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

18:57.753 --> 18:59.171
I'll see you later.

19:00.422 --> 19:03.425
Well, Brandon, I was hoping
you would be waiting on me tonight.

19:03.508 --> 19:05.051
No, I don't work on Mondays.

19:05.135 --> 19:08.096
Oh, that's good. Gives you
more time to study, that's good.

19:08.180 --> 19:09.931
Yeah, well, I gotta go.

19:10.015 --> 19:13.101
You have no idea how it makes me feel
when one of my students

19:13.185 --> 19:17.355
turns his studies around. You obviously
worked very hard to improve.

19:17.606 --> 19:21.151
- Mr Danzel, can I be honest with you?
- Yes.

19:22.152 --> 19:24.988
When I was making C's in your class,
you didn't have the time of day for me.

19:25.071 --> 19:27.407
But now that I'm making A's,
you're very friendly and interested.

19:27.490 --> 19:28.616
Why is that?

19:28.825 --> 19:30.535
I didn't know you
when you were making C's.

19:30.618 --> 19:34.581
- Exactly. You never made the effort.
- I have five classes a day...

19:34.664 --> 19:36.708
And no one's learning anything
in any of them.

19:36.791 --> 19:38.960
Anyone can memorize a bunch of facts,
but that doesn't mean

19:39.043 --> 19:41.880
- they're learning anything.
- Memorization lays the foundation

19:41.963 --> 19:45.300
for a college education where the ideas
can be more fully examined.

19:45.383 --> 19:49.262
By who? A bunch of students
who've never been challenged to think?

19:49.345 --> 19:50.513
Who've been told they're average

19:50.597 --> 19:52.849
because some unfair curve
screws them around?

19:52.932 --> 19:54.142
Now, you listen to me, young man...

19:54.225 --> 19:57.312
No, I can't stand here and listen to you
pat yourself on the back.

19:57.395 --> 19:59.480
The way you teach and give grades
is unfair.

19:59.564 --> 20:03.693
It alienates everybody and makes...
It just doesn't work.

20:31.095 --> 20:32.847
Is there a problem, Mr Walsh?

20:34.849 --> 20:37.059
No, no, no problem.

21:18.434 --> 21:19.893
Come on, Andrea,
will you let me explain?

21:19.977 --> 21:22.771
No, you don't have to explain anything.
I mean, who needs a study partner

21:22.855 --> 21:23.939
when they can cheat all by themselves?

21:24.023 --> 21:25.232
- Would you lower your voice?
- Better yet,

21:25.315 --> 21:27.067
how about we don't say anything at all?

21:30.279 --> 21:31.989
Come on, it's not like I do it all the time.

21:32.072 --> 21:34.741
Right. That's why you didn't miss
one question on last week's quiz.

21:34.825 --> 21:36.577
Hey, I'm not gonna let Danzel
screw up my GPA!

21:36.660 --> 21:38.537
Oh, yeah, but you will let him
sing your praises

21:38.620 --> 21:40.414
- and give you a standing ovation.
- Andrea, that's not fair.

21:40.497 --> 21:41.748
No, I don't want to talk to you, all right?

21:41.832 --> 21:43.500
As far as I'm concerned
you're a total hypocrite,

21:43.584 --> 21:45.711
and you're just lucky I didn't turn you in.

21:48.672 --> 21:51.049
You are the one person around here...

21:53.844 --> 21:55.053
Excuse me.

21:57.055 --> 21:59.850
So, Joshua, how's that story
on the swim team coming?

22:07.232 --> 22:09.317
- Congratulations.
- For what?

22:09.401 --> 22:10.694
I heard you aced Danzel's quiz.

22:10.777 --> 22:12.863
<i>Was it on the Nightly News
or something?</i>

22:12.946 --> 22:15.073
<i>No, Ripley's Believe It or Not.</i>

22:15.157 --> 22:18.201
I wouldn't mind believing the same thing
about you, little Miss Ripley.

22:18.285 --> 22:21.288
Hey, I don't have Danzel's class.
Thank God.

22:21.371 --> 22:24.291
- Well, I think it's great.
- We hear you, dear.

22:24.374 --> 22:26.543
I can't be proud of my son?
I think it's terrific

22:26.626 --> 22:28.086
the way he's working so hard
doing so well.

22:28.169 --> 22:30.338
Could we possibly talk
about something other than grades

22:30.422 --> 22:32.048
and working hard, huh?

22:32.132 --> 22:35.260
I think this is great. We never discuss
anything at my house.

22:35.552 --> 22:36.928
Count your blessings.

22:37.846 --> 22:40.473
I'm not saying anything
is fundamentally wrong with him,

22:40.557 --> 22:44.102
but for a kid who's finally getting A's,
he doesn't seem very proud of himself.

22:44.185 --> 22:46.271
That's okay.
You're proud enough for him.

22:46.521 --> 22:49.023
As if you're just a passive observer
in all this.

22:49.274 --> 22:52.235
Well, obviously, I like it
when the kids make the honor roll,

22:52.569 --> 22:55.113
- but grades aren't everything.
- Who said they were?

22:55.196 --> 22:57.740
All I'm saying is that
with this particular history class,

22:57.824 --> 23:00.910
Brandon doesn't need us
to put any additional pressure on him.

23:01.703 --> 23:03.329
Point noted and taken.

23:07.083 --> 23:09.043
Brenda, I told you,
mixing the two colors together

23:09.127 --> 23:10.837
is what brings out the highlights.

23:11.045 --> 23:13.423
- My mother is going to kill me.
- Why?

23:13.506 --> 23:16.008
She's the one who needs to do
something with her hair.

23:16.175 --> 23:17.719
Brenda, she does.

23:18.970 --> 23:21.180
Now, it is good that we got the ash tint,

23:21.264 --> 23:23.474
because that keeps out
the red highlights.

23:24.058 --> 23:25.393
Or it puts them in.

23:26.018 --> 23:28.729
- Doesn't matter.
- What do you mean, it doesn't matter?

23:28.813 --> 23:31.524
Brenda, relax, okay?
Meditate or something.

23:31.607 --> 23:33.776
I told you, I know what I'm doing.

23:35.069 --> 23:38.406
Now, this process takes all night,
but when you wake up in the morning,

23:38.489 --> 23:40.491
you are gonna be a brand new woman.

23:40.992 --> 23:42.910
A brand new woman.

23:48.124 --> 23:51.377
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

23:51.669 --> 23:53.170
Oh, my God!

23:56.006 --> 23:58.217
Oh, my God!

24:00.219 --> 24:03.347
- What happened?
- I colored my hair.

24:03.806 --> 24:06.016
- What am I gonna do?
- Move.

24:07.184 --> 24:09.854
Move to some other city
where nobody knows you.

24:09.937 --> 24:12.314
You can start all over again.
I'll go with you.

24:12.398 --> 24:14.692
We'll dye my hair, too,
and we'll join the circus.

24:14.775 --> 24:16.360
You know, I thought it looked weird
last night,

24:16.443 --> 24:18.153
but Kelly swore the color
would tone down by morning.

24:18.237 --> 24:20.489
Come on, come on, it's not that bad.

24:21.115 --> 24:26.036
Just pretend it's cool, or punk,
or something.

24:26.120 --> 24:28.831
It is something.
It's hideous and I hate it.

24:29.039 --> 24:30.624
Then why'd you dye it?

24:31.333 --> 24:33.585
'Cause I thought
it would make things different.

24:34.711 --> 24:37.548
It has, Brenda. Believe me.

24:37.631 --> 24:40.175
No, it hasn't.
I'm still the exact same person inside.

24:40.259 --> 24:41.802
Only now I look worse.

24:48.350 --> 24:49.935
- Good morning.
- Morning.

24:50.686 --> 24:52.813
Oh, you've got enough books here
to start a library.

24:52.896 --> 24:54.940
- How's the studying going?
- Chill, Dad.

24:55.023 --> 24:57.818
- I'm supposed to chill.
- I second that.

25:04.783 --> 25:06.118
Brenda!

25:08.537 --> 25:10.163
Kind of cool, huh, guys?

25:10.872 --> 25:13.166
Give it time. It'll grow on you.

25:17.671 --> 25:18.922
It'll grow.

25:19.756 --> 25:21.216
Did you see the way she looked at me?

25:21.299 --> 25:23.760
Okay, okay, maybe she was
a little shocked at first,

25:23.844 --> 25:25.720
but Dad calmed her down.

25:25.804 --> 25:28.974
And to tell you the truth,
it's really not that bad.

25:29.474 --> 25:32.644
- Should I wear the hat?
- I would.

25:33.520 --> 25:35.230
- Bye.
- Bye.

25:43.822 --> 25:45.073
Brandon.

25:45.490 --> 25:47.325
Earth to Walsh.

25:47.700 --> 25:51.162
- What is wrong with you?
- Jacob Danzel, American history.

25:51.287 --> 25:54.040
- Oh, yes. I had him last year.
- You did?

25:54.124 --> 25:56.626
- Yeah, some wardrobe, huh?
- Some teacher.

25:56.709 --> 25:58.920
All he cares about is his holy curve.

25:59.003 --> 26:02.257
- Yeah, well, he's retiring this year.
- He is?

26:02.674 --> 26:03.758
He's supposed to keep it quiet, though.

26:03.841 --> 26:05.635
He doesn't want everybody
making a big deal.

26:06.386 --> 26:08.388
I'll tell you what,
if Danzel announces retirement,

26:08.471 --> 26:11.224
it wouldn't be a big deal.
It'd be a national holiday.

26:12.183 --> 26:15.895
- I learned a lot from him, personally.
- All I'm learning is how to cheat.

26:16.396 --> 26:20.108
Watch out, man,
you're flirting with bad karma.

26:20.191 --> 26:21.567
Hey, what kind of marks did you get?

26:21.651 --> 26:23.611
- Does it matter?
- Yeah.

26:24.153 --> 26:25.405
Be careful.

26:39.502 --> 26:42.755
Brenda!
We've been looking all over for you.

26:43.506 --> 26:46.384
- Cute hat.
- I was in a hat mood.

26:46.801 --> 26:48.636
Show us your hair, silly.

26:52.014 --> 26:54.558
Brenda! It's...

26:55.226 --> 26:56.519
It's...

26:58.270 --> 27:00.981
Brenda, I love it, it's great. I really do.

27:01.524 --> 27:02.608
You don't think it's...

27:02.691 --> 27:03.734
- No.
- No.

27:03.818 --> 27:04.985
It's...

27:05.736 --> 27:07.780
- See you.
- Bye.

27:18.791 --> 27:20.626
Hey, Brandon!

27:21.835 --> 27:23.712
I saw you dodging me earlier.
What's going on?

27:23.796 --> 27:26.298
Look, I just feel kind of weird
about this whole Danzel thing.

27:26.382 --> 27:29.593
- Will you lighten up, Brandon?
- Doesn't it make you feel guilty?

27:29.677 --> 27:31.136
Guilty as charged.

27:31.220 --> 27:33.931
- What's this?
- Christmas and summer rolled into one.

27:34.014 --> 27:36.725
- Steve, I don't want to touch this.
- Are you crazy?

27:36.809 --> 27:38.769
Look at the questions.
You could study for two weeks

27:38.852 --> 27:40.354
and still not come up with half this stuff.

27:40.437 --> 27:43.982
- I gotta go.
- Hey, you cheated on the last quiz.

27:44.066 --> 27:46.527
That was a quiz. This is the mid-term.

27:48.153 --> 27:49.822
It's your future.

27:59.331 --> 28:01.041
Hey, Andrea.

28:01.583 --> 28:03.877
- Come on, I gotta talk to you.
- There's nothing to talk about.

28:03.961 --> 28:06.922
- God, you are so judgmental.
- Yeah, you're damn right I am!

28:07.005 --> 28:09.841
I got a C because you cheated.
I didn't deserve that!

28:09.925 --> 28:12.010
- Talk to Danzel, it's his curve!
- I'm talking to you

28:12.094 --> 28:13.720
because it's your fault.

28:17.390 --> 28:22.270
In 1850, there were around
120,000 Indians in California.

28:23.063 --> 28:27.067
How many were still alive by 1880,
Mr Walsh?

28:28.235 --> 28:30.445
- Only 20,000.
- That's correct.

28:30.529 --> 28:33.949
Now tell me, Mr Walsh,
what contributed to this rapid decline?

28:34.699 --> 28:38.954
- Well, the white man killed them off.
- Well, everybody knows that, Mr Walsh.

28:39.704 --> 28:42.248
I'm asking
what was the principle cause?

28:45.794 --> 28:49.089
Come on, Mr Walsh,
surely you dug deeper

28:49.172 --> 28:53.510
in order to understand the broader
historical context of this question.

28:57.055 --> 29:00.058
You don't think it's important to know
that the white man confiscated

29:00.141 --> 29:03.061
the Indians' land, took their homes,

29:03.728 --> 29:06.814
caused them to seek refuge
in remote, barren locales

29:06.898 --> 29:09.317
where health could not
possibly be sustained?

29:09.609 --> 29:12.445
- Sure, it's important to know that.
- Then why don't you?

29:12.820 --> 29:15.698
- Tell us what happened to the others.
- The other Indians?

29:15.907 --> 29:19.494
No. No, the other space aliens.

29:22.664 --> 29:25.917
Yes, the Indians. That's what
we've been studying, remember?

29:27.460 --> 29:28.586
Yes?

29:28.669 --> 29:31.798
The other Indians were imprisoned
on the so-called reservations

29:31.881 --> 29:34.801
where they were forced to live
by the white man's rules.

29:35.051 --> 29:36.302
Thank you, Miss Zuckerman.

29:36.385 --> 29:38.513
Mr Walsh told me the other day
that he resented

29:38.596 --> 29:40.598
the memorization required in this class,

29:40.681 --> 29:43.184
that he wanted to be
challenged to think.

29:43.976 --> 29:48.231
Mr Walsh, I have just challenged you.
And where did it get us?

29:48.981 --> 29:51.817
Is it my fault that you chose
only to memorize the facts

29:51.984 --> 29:54.153
and didn't take the time to think?

29:56.822 --> 30:00.242
Mid-term on Monday, class.
I suggest you start studying

30:00.451 --> 30:02.203
and thinking.

30:15.424 --> 30:17.384
You can take your hat off in the house.

30:18.511 --> 30:20.763
Is that supposed to make me feel bad
or good?

30:20.930 --> 30:22.473
- I begged you not to touch your hair.
- Mother...

30:22.556 --> 30:24.850
- Didn't I?
- Look, you just don't understand.

30:24.934 --> 30:27.269
Yes, I do. Honey, honey.

30:28.187 --> 30:30.439
Don't you think I know
what you're going through?

30:32.733 --> 30:35.444
The summer that I turned 17,
all I heard on the radio

30:35.527 --> 30:38.614
was how they wished
we could all be California girls.

30:40.699 --> 30:42.409
So you know what Paula and I did?

30:42.868 --> 30:46.163
We ironed our hair
right on the ironing board.

30:46.830 --> 30:50.501
I mean, Paula's hair caught fire
and she singed off all her split ends,

30:50.584 --> 30:53.420
then she put an entire bottle of peroxide
over her head.

30:55.797 --> 30:58.300
Is the moral of this story
that it'll grow back?

30:59.718 --> 31:01.428
Oh, Brenda,

31:02.846 --> 31:05.057
don't you know how beautiful you are?

31:14.816 --> 31:16.943
- Brandon.
- Steve.

31:17.027 --> 31:20.405
Man, I can't believe the way that jerk
Danzel treated you in class today.

31:20.489 --> 31:23.450
- Everybody was talking about it.
- Yeah, it was real special.

31:23.784 --> 31:26.536
Who does he think he is?
If he treated me like that...

31:26.745 --> 31:28.497
Steve, what are you doing here?

31:29.122 --> 31:31.082
I don't know.

31:33.084 --> 31:34.419
The way you were talking
in the hall today,

31:34.503 --> 31:36.004
I got worried that you might bust me.

31:36.296 --> 31:38.673
Hey, come on, Steve, I wouldn't do that.

31:38.924 --> 31:40.133
Yeah, I know we're friends.

31:40.216 --> 31:43.929
It's just I want you to be
in on this with me.

31:44.471 --> 31:47.015
- It's just not right.
- Compared to what?

31:47.140 --> 31:48.850
Failing the class, Brandon?

31:49.225 --> 31:52.312
Everybody cheats.
Everybody bends the rules.

31:52.395 --> 31:55.273
You either take advantage of it
or you get left behind.

31:55.648 --> 31:59.277
Brandon, excuse me.
I'm curious, do you still work here?

31:59.486 --> 32:02.363
Yeah. Steve, I've got to jam.

32:02.655 --> 32:05.366
Brandon, what's your father gonna say

32:05.450 --> 32:07.076
if you come home with a C?

32:08.411 --> 32:09.829
Or an F?

32:11.206 --> 32:13.583
Someday, when you're
sitting behind a big desk

32:13.666 --> 32:15.835
in a big office with a big view,

32:17.629 --> 32:19.589
you'll thank me for this.

32:40.777 --> 32:42.987
- See you, Nat.
- See you, kid.

32:43.070 --> 32:47.033
Hey, Brandon,
you're doing a real nice job, you know.

32:48.159 --> 32:49.535
Thanks, Nat.

33:19.940 --> 33:21.484
Got a flat tire, huh?

33:22.526 --> 33:27.031
How very observant of you.
I wish the Auto Club was as attentive.

33:27.615 --> 33:31.535
- Did someone let the air out of it?
- You've been inside all evening.

33:34.079 --> 33:35.706
You don't know how to fix a flat, huh?

33:35.873 --> 33:39.043
There are some things I would
much rather pay somebody else to do.

33:39.501 --> 33:41.253
If you can find someone.

33:42.588 --> 33:44.548
And you know how to do it?

33:47.843 --> 33:50.179
So, I heard you're retiring this year.

33:50.262 --> 33:53.640
Well, there comes a time
when one must move on.

33:54.683 --> 33:57.978
I know you don't consider me
to be a particularly effective teacher,

33:58.061 --> 34:00.939
but there are those
who feel I do a good job.

34:01.023 --> 34:02.191
Well, I didn't mean...

34:02.274 --> 34:04.902
Now don't insult my intelligence,
Mr Walsh.

34:05.569 --> 34:08.362
I know the kids don't like me.
I hear the comments,

34:08.447 --> 34:11.949
I hear the constant complaining,
the jokes about my clothes.

34:12.034 --> 34:14.703
I am not deaf yet.

34:16.163 --> 34:19.166
But those same students,
they may not like me,

34:19.875 --> 34:22.043
but they will remember my class,

34:22.127 --> 34:24.337
and they will remember
what they learned.

34:26.422 --> 34:27.924
The truth is,

34:28.425 --> 34:32.387
I'm not terribly impressed
with a lot of my clothes myself.

34:35.014 --> 34:38.726
My wife picked them all out for me.
She was ill.

34:40.520 --> 34:43.231
She knew I didn't have the patience
to shop for myself.

34:44.774 --> 34:47.068
She was bound and determined

34:47.319 --> 34:49.946
that I would have enough clothes
to wear...

35:00.415 --> 35:03.585
They're the one thing I've got
to help me remember.

35:10.091 --> 35:11.468
Good grief, I...

35:14.512 --> 35:16.890
As much as I hate to admit it,

35:18.141 --> 35:20.518
I probably could change a tire
if I had to.

35:20.727 --> 35:22.103
Well,

35:24.272 --> 35:26.107
there'll be a quiz on Monday.

35:34.073 --> 35:35.450
You dropped this.

35:37.035 --> 35:39.203
Oh, did I? Thanks.

35:39.787 --> 35:41.581
How much do I owe you?

35:43.541 --> 35:45.209
It's no problem. Really.

35:45.710 --> 35:49.046
Well, see you in class Monday.
Good luck with the mid-term.

35:49.297 --> 35:50.423
Thanks.

36:38.137 --> 36:39.471
What're you doing?

36:39.555 --> 36:41.390
You never cheated on anything,
have you?

36:41.473 --> 36:42.766
I'm trying to study.

36:46.437 --> 36:50.232
- No, I've never cheated on anything.
- But you've wanted to, haven't you?

36:50.315 --> 36:52.234
- I don't see what that has...
- Haven't you?

36:52.651 --> 36:54.862
Of course I have. Who hasn't?

36:55.112 --> 36:57.698
The point is, I didn't and you did.

36:57.781 --> 36:59.741
And you're never going to let me
forget it, are you?

36:59.825 --> 37:01.577
Cheating is wrong, Brandon.
What do you want me to say?

37:01.660 --> 37:02.786
Nothing.

37:02.870 --> 37:04.872
You know, sometimes you act
like you have a personal stake

37:04.955 --> 37:07.416
in everything I do.
Like we're a couple or something.

37:07.499 --> 37:08.667
Yeah, right.

37:08.750 --> 37:10.752
But you see everything only as
black and white,

37:10.836 --> 37:11.920
right or wrong.

37:12.004 --> 37:14.798
But what I did in Danzel's class
was not a black-and-white issue.

37:14.881 --> 37:17.843
- It was a grey area.
- Oh, so by calling it a grey area,

37:17.926 --> 37:20.053
- does that make you feel less guilty?
- No.

37:20.470 --> 37:23.598
You probably don't believe it,
but I feel plenty guilty already.

37:23.890 --> 37:26.309
What I was hoping for from you
was maybe a little understanding,

37:26.393 --> 37:27.894
maybe a little support.

37:30.147 --> 37:31.565
Thanks, Andrea.

37:32.899 --> 37:34.276
Thanks for nothing.

37:35.402 --> 37:37.237
- Brandon.
- I got to study.

37:37.362 --> 37:38.488
Bran...

37:48.790 --> 37:51.251
Brenda, you don't need the hat.

37:51.585 --> 37:53.878
You're right.
Do we have any paper bags?

37:53.962 --> 37:55.297
Oh, stop.

37:55.755 --> 37:57.215
Mom, this is not funny.

37:57.716 --> 38:01.261
Honey, I didn't say it was funny.
I thought you were making a joke.

38:01.344 --> 38:04.180
Trust me, Mom.
My hair is no joking matter.

38:04.723 --> 38:06.683
You've got to be able
to laugh at yourself sometimes,

38:06.766 --> 38:08.852
otherwise you just make
yourself miserable.

38:09.477 --> 38:11.729
- Have a nice jog.
- Thanks.

38:40.508 --> 38:42.051
- Hi.
- Hi.

38:42.135 --> 38:43.261
I thought that was you,

38:43.344 --> 38:45.930
but didn't your hair used to be
a little different?

38:46.013 --> 38:50.101
Yes. No. Well, maybe just a little bit.

38:50.601 --> 38:52.854
I hate this color,
if that's what you can call it.

38:52.937 --> 38:53.980
It's not that bad.

38:54.063 --> 38:57.191
- If one more person says that...
- It's not that bad!

38:57.400 --> 38:59.485
Don't all you guys out here
have a thing for blondes?

38:59.569 --> 39:01.237
I mean, that's what you told Kelly.

39:02.488 --> 39:07.326
Blondes, brunettes, redheads,
girls in tank tops.

39:09.787 --> 39:11.872
But, if you really hate that color,

39:12.665 --> 39:15.251
I have a friend who does hair,
and he owes me a favor.

39:15.501 --> 39:20.131
Oh, I don't really hate the color.
But maybe we should still go see him

39:20.423 --> 39:22.633
for a second opinion or something,
don't you think?

39:22.717 --> 39:24.343
No problem.

39:27.471 --> 39:29.098
I like your butt.

39:30.641 --> 39:32.268
I mean, your bike.

39:32.601 --> 39:35.479
Oh, well, thank you. Hop on.

39:36.313 --> 39:38.274
My bike, that is.

39:54.289 --> 39:56.166
Have you been at the library
all this time?

39:56.250 --> 39:59.294
Mostly, yeah.
Working, thinking, you know.

40:00.546 --> 40:02.881
At the very least, you get an A for effort.

40:02.965 --> 40:06.260
- Well, I expect to get an A on the test.
- That's what I like to hear.

40:06.385 --> 40:08.971
- But if you don't it'll be okay.
- Will it?

40:10.013 --> 40:11.348
Well, of course, it will.

40:11.431 --> 40:14.476
I mean, that's what you guys say,
but that's not what you really think.

40:14.643 --> 40:17.980
If I get a C from Danzel,
or I end up at Outer Swobobia State,

40:18.063 --> 40:20.983
you guys would be disappointed in me,
you'd be angry with me, right?

40:22.776 --> 40:25.195
- Come on, Dad, tell me the truth.
- The truth?

40:25.404 --> 40:27.114
Yeah, tell me what you want.

40:27.447 --> 40:31.535
What I want in regards to your life
and to your future,

40:31.952 --> 40:34.037
is to see you smile again.

40:45.715 --> 40:47.717
Well, look at you.

40:49.177 --> 40:51.304
Yeah, back to basics.

40:51.388 --> 40:53.974
At least we don't have to join
the circus anymore.

40:55.267 --> 40:59.604
- It looks different than before.
- Dylan says it looks incandescent.

41:00.021 --> 41:03.108
- My friend Dylan?
- My friend Dylan.

41:24.420 --> 41:26.381
- Hey, there.
- Hi.

41:27.882 --> 41:29.676
- Brandon...
- Andrea...

41:30.552 --> 41:34.931
Look, I'm not in the best of moods.
I was up all night studying.

41:35.306 --> 41:38.309
- I was, too.
- What, making cheat notes?

41:38.893 --> 41:40.520
It crossed my mind.

41:41.771 --> 41:45.775
But if I cheated, I might screw up
the curve for this friend of mine,

41:46.317 --> 41:49.904
who I care about and respect
more than she knows.

41:52.615 --> 41:54.826
Even if she can be a royal pain.

41:56.369 --> 41:59.956
I have a friend who's one of those.

42:00.498 --> 42:05.002
Well, maybe we should introduce them.
They'd probably get along just great.

42:05.461 --> 42:06.754
I doubt it.

42:23.270 --> 42:26.065
- So, are you prepared?
- Yeah, I am.

42:26.565 --> 42:27.983
I tore up my copy of the test.

42:28.067 --> 42:30.194
That's smart. Burn the evidence.
It's safer that way.

42:30.277 --> 42:33.906
Steve, I couldn't bring myself
to look at it.

42:34.198 --> 42:36.742
Man, you are hopeless.
What if you flunk the test?

42:36.826 --> 42:38.035
I won't.

43:07.314 --> 43:09.233
Now before we start the test,

43:09.983 --> 43:12.653
I would like you to listen
to my instructions very carefully.

43:13.112 --> 43:14.738
Turn the test over,

43:15.489 --> 43:17.491
look at it very closely.

43:22.746 --> 43:24.164
Now tear it up.

43:26.917 --> 43:29.711
That's right. You heard me. Tear it up.

43:33.382 --> 43:35.509
Go on, tear it up.

43:41.765 --> 43:43.725
That's right. Very good, very good.

43:43.809 --> 43:46.937
Now, as far as your mid-term goes,
instead of the test,

43:47.020 --> 43:49.147
which you have just destroyed,

43:49.397 --> 43:52.609
I would like to know what you think.

43:53.777 --> 43:56.488
Your mid-term consists
of one essay question.

43:58.907 --> 44:03.036
Using examples from history
to contrast with your answer,

44:03.828 --> 44:07.499
what do you think our government
should have done in the 19th century

44:07.999 --> 44:10.418
to save the American Indian?

44:34.108 --> 44:35.818
That was a hard question,

44:36.945 --> 44:38.279
but a good hard question.

44:38.363 --> 44:40.823
I guess that depends
on what you studied for.

44:41.658 --> 44:44.661
I've been giving that same mid-term
for 15 years.

44:46.037 --> 44:51.084
Some students might even have gotten
hold of a copy of it by now, you think?

44:53.086 --> 44:58.716
Yeah, but some students
who may have had a copy of it,

44:59.383 --> 45:01.803
might have chosen not to study from it

45:03.179 --> 45:06.516
- after they thought about it.
- That's what I was thinking.

45:10.603 --> 45:12.438
It's too bad you're retiring this year.

45:13.814 --> 45:14.899
The semester isn't over yet.

45:14.982 --> 45:17.235
If you think the American Indian
was difficult,

45:17.360 --> 45:19.320
wait till we get to the Civil War.

45:22.740 --> 45:24.367
Nice suit, by the way.

45:25.451 --> 45:28.663
- It is quite hideous, isn't it?
- Yeah,

45:30.414 --> 45:32.291
but you wear it well.
