some place I've never been

01:55.916 --> 01:56.250
before.

01:56.251 --> 01:58.551
But it's still Vietnam.

01:58.552 --> 02:00.220
Where all the things, the

02:00.221 --> 02:04.257
smells, the sounds, the
details, I love so much.

02:04.258 --> 02:05.658
First night in country, it's

02:05.659 --> 02:10.330
like sliding into a warm, deeply

02:10.330 --> 02:14.934
comforting familiar bath.

02:14.935 --> 02:19.005
I've been all over Vietnam,
a place I feel a special

02:19.006 --> 02:20.039
connection to.

02:20.040 --> 02:23.676
My first love, a place I remain,

02:23.677 --> 02:27.680
beed soed with, fascinated by...

02:27.681 --> 02:29.682
Besodded with, fascinated by.

02:29.683 --> 02:32.752
So back in Vietnam, one of
my favorite places on earth.

02:32.753 --> 02:36.389
And all of the things
I need for happiness.

02:36.390 --> 02:41.594
Plastic stool, tiny little
plastic table, check.

02:41.595 --> 02:41.895
Oh.

02:41.896 --> 02:44.797
Something delicious in a bowl.

02:44.798 --> 02:45.032
Check.

02:45.033 --> 02:51.271
In this case a local
specialty, com hen, clam rice,

02:51.272 --> 02:54.941
sweet clams out of their shells,

02:54.942 --> 02:57.744
tossed with a wild swirl, beans,

02:57.745 --> 02:59.946
spicy green chillies, krumpbly

02:59.947 --> 03:03.583
roasted peanuts, fried
pork riend, and cilantro.

03:03.584 --> 03:09.389
And a similar
variation with rices.

03:09.390 --> 03:11.458
That fish sauce with chilies in

03:11.459 --> 03:16.929

singe your eyebrows off.

03:16.930 --> 03:17.765
Chilies in.

03:17.766 --> 03:22.769
Hit with hot clam broth,
and you're on your way.

03:22.770 --> 03:23.504
I'm back.

03:23.505 --> 03:25.772
Back in Vietnam.

03:25.773 --> 03:28.975
Grin for the duration.

03:28.976 --> 03:36.976
A giddy, silly, foolish
man beyond caring.

03:38.352 --> 03:42.121
And a cold local beer.

03:42.122 --> 03:50.122
My preferred brand.

03:50.864 --> 03:53.633
Ah.

03:53.634 --> 03:55.802
Clams with pork cracklings.

03:55.803 --> 03:58.971
How could that not be good?

03:58.972 --> 04:01.641
This is the way so many of the

04:01.642 --> 04:04.344
great meals of my life
have been enjoyed.

04:04.345 --> 04:05.345
Sitting in the street, eating

04:05.346 --> 04:06.813
something out of a bowl that I'm

04:06.814 --> 04:09.215
not exactly sure what it is.

04:09.216 --> 04:11.819
Scooters going by.

04:13.987 --> 04:14.622
So delicious.

04:14.623 --> 04:17.557
I feel like an animal.

04:17.558 --> 04:21.327
Where have you been all my life?

04:21.329 --> 04:24.163
Fellow travelers, this
is what you want.

04:24.164 --> 04:27.166
This is what you need.

04:27.167 --> 04:35.167
This is the path to true
happiness and wisdom.

05:07.708 --> 05:09.041
Located on the north and

05:09.042 --> 05:11.210
south banks of the perfume river

05:11.211 --> 05:15.548
in central Vietnam, mountains
behind, sea ahead, an

05:15.549 --> 05:20.052
arrangement determined by
criteria both military and

05:20.053 --> 05:20.421
spiritual.

05:20.422 --> 05:23.956
For 143 years, way was the seat

05:23.957 --> 05:25.858
of power for the dynasty which

05:25.859 --> 05:27.360
ruled the entire country until

05:27.361 --> 05:30.229
the late 1800s when the French

05:30.230 --> 05:32.198
started taking power and
land under their control.

05:32.199 --> 05:34.233
The French allow the imperial

05:34.234 --> 05:35.902
throne to rule nominally the

05:35.903 --> 05:37.236
center of the country, until the

05:37.237 --> 05:41.240
end of world war ii in 1945.

05:41.241 --> 05:43.075
Way has been celebrated for its

05:43.076 --> 05:45.111
fantastic architectures since

05:45.112 --> 05:53.112
the early 1800s, vast
palaces, pagodas, and tombs.

05:55.122 --> 05:57.724
The center is wealth of the

05:57.725 --> 05:58.492
intellectual, artists, and

05:58.493 --> 06:06.493
spiritual life of the country.

06:16.810 --> 06:24.810
Oh yeah, that's tempting.

06:26.086 --> 06:31.791
Around here somewhere.

06:31.792 --> 06:34.661
This is dong Ba market, and deep

06:34.662 --> 06:38.931
inside, somewhere in
there is what I want.

06:38.932 --> 06:42.101
My way of thinking, in the

06:42.102 --> 06:43.970
hierarchy of delicious, Slurpee

06:43.971 --> 06:51.971
stuff in a bowl, it
is at the very top.

06:54.314 --> 06:57.149
He is an author and journalist

06:57.150 --> 07:00.620
that spent much of his
childhood in hue.

07:00.621 --> 07:01.688
This will be it.

07:01.689 --> 07:02.656
This will be it.

07:02.657 --> 07:05.792
Let's do it, man.

07:05.793 --> 07:08.060
Here he creates an elaborate

07:08.061 --> 07:09.996
broth of mixed bones scented

07:09.997 --> 07:14.000
with a lemon grass, spice,
and fermented shrimp paste.

07:14.001 --> 07:16.335
At the bottom, rice noodles

07:16.336 --> 07:18.538
garnished, heaped with tender

07:18.539 --> 07:24.544
slow cooked beef shank,
pig's foot, and blood cake.

07:24.545 --> 07:26.713
Garnished with lime wedge,

07:26.714 --> 07:29.015
cilantro, green onions, shredded

07:29.016 --> 07:33.385
banana blossoms, it's a...
Blossoms, it's a wonder of

07:33.386 --> 07:34.386
flavor and texture.

07:34.387 --> 07:36.723
The greatest soup in the world.

07:36.724 --> 07:40.493
Look at that, man, that
is just unbelievable.

07:40.494 --> 07:41.194
Blood cake.

07:41.195 --> 07:42.862
Blood cake.

07:42.863 --> 07:44.831
The sauce.

07:44.832 --> 07:46.866
I want to see how
much he put in there.

07:46.867 --> 07:51.203
You have to make it look
really red in there, it has to

07:51.204 --> 07:52.238
be blood red.

07:52.239 --> 07:57.043
And the broth is wonderful.

07:57.044 --> 07:58.444
People are put on earth for

07:58.445 --> 08:03.049
various purposes, I was
put on earth to do this.

08:03.050 --> 08:04.617
Eat noodles right here.

08:04.618 --> 08:06.218
When I was a kid, we used to

08:06.219 --> 08:07.754
tell each other, do not take a

08:07.755 --> 08:10.723
date to go out to eat, if you

08:10.724 --> 08:13.025
start sweat, your hair stick up.

08:13.026 --> 08:13.561
Really?

08:13.562 --> 08:15.061
I would definitely bring a date

08:15.062 --> 08:18.030
to this, if she doesn't like
this, there's no hope of a

08:18.031 --> 08:18.365
relationship.

08:18.366 --> 08:19.398
Exactly.

08:19.399 --> 08:20.967
If she said I don't know,

08:20.968 --> 08:24.470
there's icy stuff in there, that

08:24.471 --> 08:28.541
would be a relationship
of offender for me.

08:28.542 --> 08:28.909
I'm not kidding.

08:28.910 --> 08:31.210
Here you are having it
in a market like this.

08:31.211 --> 08:37.984
She makes this place like
would be a real cuisine.

08:37.985 --> 08:42.755
It's just sophisticated a
bowl of food as any French

08:42.756 --> 08:43.056
restaurant.

08:43.057 --> 08:48.928
It really is the, just
the top of the mountain.

08:48.929 --> 08:50.630
How long has she been here?

08:50.631 --> 08:54.734
She started out when she was 12.

08:54.735 --> 08:57.770
You live in a great country,

08:57.771 --> 08:59.271
man, any country that could

08:59.272 --> 09:01.741
produce this is a
superpower, I'm concerned.

09:01.742 --> 09:04.010
I'm getting down to
the pepper residue.

09:04.011 --> 09:06.679
How long does that broth have to

09:06.680 --> 09:10.249
simmer to get good?

09:10.250 --> 09:11.283
An hour.

09:11.284 --> 09:12.252
Wow, really?

09:12.253 --> 09:16.088
I would have guessed
like 14 hours.

09:16.089 --> 09:16.624
Yum.

09:16.624 --> 09:16.924
Happy.

09:16.925 --> 09:23.129
Nice burny feeling on my
lips, flop sweat, check.

09:23.130 --> 09:23.797
Happy.

09:23.798 --> 09:27.466
So, we can pretty much
cancel the rest of the show.

09:27.467 --> 09:30.436
I've achieved the,
my happy zone.

09:30.437 --> 09:32.906
It's really all down
hill from here.

09:56.496 --> 10:00.733
My oldest friend in Vietnam.

10:00.734 --> 10:03.803
Originally assigned to
translate, the guide, to escort,

10:03.804 --> 10:05.672
and to report on me back in 2000

10:05.673 --> 10:09.075
when I first came
to this country.

10:09.076 --> 10:10.509
How are you, brother?

10:10.510 --> 10:11.244
My brother.

10:11.245 --> 10:13.880
Good to see you.

10:13.881 --> 10:14.514
His responsibilities to his

10:14.515 --> 10:15.715
employers have never been an

10:15.716 --> 10:17.850
impediment to our friendship.

10:17.851 --> 10:19.752
We meet where you pick your own

10:19.753 --> 10:24.190
seafood out of the tank,
and you cook it yourself.

10:24.191 --> 10:26.058
You really do look
exactly the same.

10:26.059 --> 10:26.694
You look good.

10:26.694 --> 10:27.327
Yeah?

10:27.328 --> 10:30.830
Oh yeah.

10:30.831 --> 10:32.932
No trace of time on your face.

10:32.933 --> 10:36.736
My hair is white, I
have lines on my face.

10:36.737 --> 10:38.504
I look completely
different in 2000.

10:38.505 --> 10:42.374
People told me the sea food

10:42.375 --> 10:43.076
is from the lagoon over here.

10:43.077 --> 10:45.712
It is one of the biggest
ones in southeast Asia.

10:45.713 --> 10:49.716
I'm going for some eel.

10:49.717 --> 10:52.218
Season with lemon grass, green

10:52.219 --> 10:54.453
chilly and pepper, drizzle with

10:54.454 --> 10:58.357
house special sauce, grill
over charcoal and dig in.

10:58.358 --> 11:00.392
I have the picture with you.

11:00.393 --> 11:02.594
You have some old photos?

11:02.595 --> 11:04.697
Oh, look at me, come on.

11:04.698 --> 11:07.734
I look like my aunt Sonia, look

11:07.735 --> 11:11.303

11:13.807 --> 11:14.641
He's now 17.

11:14.642 --> 11:17.744
Oh my god, he's going
to college soon.

11:17.745 --> 11:18.045
Wow.

11:18.046 --> 11:21.247
This is the island of Mr. Sang.

11:21.248 --> 11:26.152
Yes, on the bay.

11:26.153 --> 11:29.722
Oh my god, look at that.

11:29.723 --> 11:31.323
We look cool.

11:31.324 --> 11:34.426
We totally look cool here.

11:34.427 --> 11:35.895
But does everybody fall in love

11:35.896 --> 11:37.096
with the country like I did?

11:37.097 --> 11:39.631
I came here, and
it stole my heart.

11:39.632 --> 11:41.600
You know.

11:41.601 --> 11:46.572
I think it's a very
good meeting point.

11:46.573 --> 11:54.573
But in the past, it was over,
and now is a new time.

11:59.753 --> 12:00.620
Mm.

12:00.620 --> 12:01.588
Wow, that's great.

12:01.589 --> 12:03.289
Dude, that's pretty spicy.

12:03.290 --> 12:05.024
Perfect with beer.

12:05.025 --> 12:08.360
We need more drinks.

12:08.361 --> 12:11.130
Lobster from the
south China sea.

12:11.131 --> 12:19.131
Give it a nice haircut table
side, and it's perfect.

12:20.473 --> 12:21.008
Sweet.

12:21.009 --> 12:23.609
Sweet, just like I remember.

12:23.610 --> 12:24.811
Yeah.

12:24.812 --> 12:26.345
Yep.

12:26.346 --> 12:28.014
Sentimental guy.

12:28.015 --> 12:29.816
Sometimes at work I try to be

12:29.817 --> 12:32.651
serious, and I just think about

12:32.652 --> 12:34.954
work, but I don't know why, when

12:34.955 --> 12:36.488
I think about you, I think about

12:36.489 --> 12:38.457
drinking and getting
something good to eat.

12:38.458 --> 12:39.826
One more cheer.

14:40.247 --> 14:41.847
During the holiday, when usually

14:41.848 --> 14:44.951
there was a sensation of
hostilities, more than 100

14:44.952 --> 14:46.085
cities all over south Vietnam

14:46.086 --> 14:51.590
were attacked by the
north Vietnamese and VC.

14:51.591 --> 14:56.295
Hue quickly fell.

14:56.296 --> 14:57.964
You have seen these images.

14:57.965 --> 14:59.465
It was footage like this that

14:59.466 --> 15:01.833
turned finally a great part of

15:01.834 --> 15:09.834
the American public
against the war.

15:09.842 --> 15:11.343
The U.S. marines fought house to

15:11.344 --> 15:13.812
house to retake the city.

15:13.813 --> 15:20.152
A vicious three and a
half week long battle.

15:20.153 --> 15:25.324
Eventually, artillery and
air support were called in.

15:25.325 --> 15:27.493
The city was saved.

15:27.494 --> 15:33.665
And of course, largely
destroyed in the saving.

15:33.666 --> 15:35.801
The civilian population caught

15:35.802 --> 15:41.140
in the cross fire were
equally devastated.

15:41.141 --> 15:45.011
The north Vietnamese to their
enduring shame had while

15:45.012 --> 15:46.512
controlling the city, round up

15:46.513 --> 15:48.547
anyone seen as a potential enemy

15:48.548 --> 15:51.017
and either disappeared them away

15:51.018 --> 15:53.752
to unknown prisons or
killed them outright.

15:53.753 --> 15:56.222
Most notoriously when they

15:56.223 --> 15:57.489
massacred almost 3,000 people,

15:57.490 --> 15:59.191
rolling them, many of them still

15:59.192 --> 16:05.231
alive in a mass graves
in and around hue.

16:05.232 --> 16:06.598
He knows full well the horrors

16:06.599 --> 16:08.700
and heartbreak of that time.

16:08.701 --> 16:10.869
In his memoir, where the ashes

16:10.870 --> 16:14.106
are, the odyssey of an American

16:14.107 --> 16:15.107
family, he captures the terror

16:15.108 --> 16:16.708
of a nine-year-old boy, the son

16:16.709 --> 16:18.710
of a high ranking civil servant

16:18.711 --> 16:22.714
caught up in the
nightmare of war.

16:22.715 --> 16:24.783
Where were you in 1968?

16:24.784 --> 16:28.454
I was at the place where
it's now a hotel.

16:28.455 --> 16:30.222
My parents were staying there,

16:30.223 --> 16:31.390
we were staying there, we were

16:31.391 --> 16:33.392
surrounded during the
night, we didn't even know.

16:33.393 --> 16:36.062
My father looked out the window

16:36.063 --> 16:39.565
and thought it was south
Vietnamese soldiers.

16:39.566 --> 16:41.733
Even was surprised.

16:41.734 --> 16:43.302
We thought it was something
happening out in the

16:43.303 --> 16:44.303
battlefields and the mountains,

16:44.304 --> 16:47.373
out in the countryside, and all

16:47.374 --> 16:48.974
the sudden, we come here, and

16:48.975 --> 16:51.743
there's the flag of the national

16:51.744 --> 16:55.814
liberation front, and to see
that was complete shock.

16:55.815 --> 17:01.153
We stayed for a week in the
basement, and the American

17:01.154 --> 17:01.888
soldiers came.

17:01.889 --> 17:05.723
By that time they marched
my father away, the north

17:05.724 --> 17:07.259
Vietnamese soldiers, we didn't

17:07.260 --> 17:09.060
know where he was taken to and

17:09.061 --> 17:11.997
we had no idea whether
he was alive or not.

17:11.998 --> 17:14.133
My mother went out to the mass

17:14.134 --> 17:16.734
graves and she saws the bodies

17:16.736 --> 17:22.973
and she said I can't go
there and look for him.

17:22.974 --> 17:23.143
♪

17:23.144 --> 17:25.144
A lot of people died here.

17:25.145 --> 17:27.012
You cannot help thinking

17:27.012 --> 17:28.780
about these people who died when

17:28.781 --> 17:31.250
they're young, who
died for no reason.

17:31.251 --> 17:33.452
Who just got caught
in the fire fights.

17:33.453 --> 17:34.586
We have the day of the dead

17:34.587 --> 17:37.856
here, the day of the souls, and

17:37.857 --> 17:41.493
we honor those who are not
buried within their home

17:41.494 --> 17:43.295
village, and are not taken care

17:43.296 --> 17:45.464
of, their spirits are
not taken care of.

17:45.465 --> 17:48.367
There are families here who
don't have a death date.

17:48.368 --> 17:51.470
Which is huge, a death
anniversary in the Vietnamese is

17:51.471 --> 17:53.004
when you do the ceremonies, you

17:53.005 --> 17:55.207
pay attention to the dead.

17:55.208 --> 17:56.775
You can't do that if you don't

17:56.776 --> 17:59.845
know when they really died.

17:59.846 --> 18:04.015
You just assume those people
are just never liberated,

18:04.016 --> 18:09.988
spiritually, that they
are stuck in that space.

18:09.989 --> 18:13.192
It was like that for my father

18:13.193 --> 18:15.894
because he was in prison,
we had no news from him.

18:15.895 --> 18:17.496
You couldn't set up an alter,

18:17.497 --> 18:20.366
you just hoped
that he was alive.

18:20.367 --> 18:22.468
Ten, 12, 15 of your friends are

18:22.469 --> 18:24.336
going out and doing things, you

18:24.337 --> 18:27.506
just had that weight on you that

18:27.507 --> 18:29.975
your father is somewhere
imprisoned or in the jungles.

18:29.976 --> 18:35.013
And that stuff stayed with
me for 40 years in my mind.

18:35.014 --> 18:37.183
I don't know how many Vietnamese

18:37.184 --> 18:40.152
have that kind of experience.

18:40.153 --> 18:43.155
At the same time, I come back to

18:43.156 --> 18:45.524
hue, my hometown, my family's

18:45.525 --> 18:47.159
hometown, I'm glad people are

18:47.160 --> 18:48.594
alive, people are living, things

18:48.595 --> 18:56.595
are happening,
things are changing.

18:57.370 --> 18:59.104
We need to let the country open

18:59.105 --> 19:01.440
up and let the people have a

19:01.441 --> 19:07.413
moment of enjoyment,
have a better life.

19:07.414 --> 19:09.215
I mean, obviously I'm an

19:09.216 --> 19:12.584
outsider, but it seems to me as

19:12.585 --> 19:15.053
a casual observer, you
can survive anything.

19:15.054 --> 19:19.558
That's what my brother reminds
me, things happening in

19:19.559 --> 19:22.894
Vietnam, it survived
4,000 years.

19:22.895 --> 19:23.962
It will do okay.

19:23.963 --> 19:27.466
When you ask me to be
hopeful, I am hopeful.

19:27.467 --> 19:28.634
It's a young country.

19:28.635 --> 19:30.402
It's a young population.

19:30.403 --> 19:32.538
It's energetic and that drives

19:32.539 --> 19:34.206
me, that gives me hope that

19:34.207 --> 19:35.941
makes me young, that makes me to

19:35.942 --> 19:37.376
want believe in this country.

19:37.377 --> 19:38.311
And this town.

19:38.312 --> 19:39.779
Such a wonderful place to be.

♪

20:03.002 --> 20:06.605
Boi Tran is a painter, and
something of a throwback, an

20:06.606 --> 20:07.839
anomaly, a creature from another

20:07.840 --> 20:14.079
earlier time in the life of
the one time imperial city.

20:14.080 --> 20:16.915
She lives in an area called the

20:16.916 --> 20:20.686
hill, in a magnificently
restored compound.

20:20.687 --> 20:22.454
These traditional wooden houses

20:22.455 --> 20:26.191
were once part of the regal
style with slope grooves to

20:26.192 --> 20:28.594
handle all the
rainy hue weather.

20:28.595 --> 20:30.128
But most importantly, they

20:30.129 --> 20:32.298
feature a garden at the center,

20:32.299 --> 20:35.100
which follows the eastern
philosophy that all things

20:35.101 --> 20:36.535
originate from a single source,

20:36.536 --> 20:42.508
and expand in all directions.

21:15.241 --> 21:17.175
from a repertoire of imperial

21:17.176 --> 21:21.813
hue dishes numbering over 100.

21:21.814 --> 21:23.715
Back in dynastic time, the

21:23.716 --> 21:26.251
emperor ts demanded varieties in

21:26.252 --> 21:28.654
wives of sometimes
over 100, and in food.

21:28.655 --> 21:32.023
The menus of the 19th century

21:32.024 --> 21:33.892
boasted new dishes every night.

21:33.893 --> 21:38.730
Small, flavorful, and
beautifully presented.

21:38.731 --> 21:43.435
And that cultural tradition
continues today.

21:43.436 --> 21:44.870
How much of that persists?

21:44.871 --> 21:51.209
Those imperial roots
that need for variety?

21:51.210 --> 21:56.548
Yes, the tradition has stayed,
and it will stay forever

21:56.549 --> 22:00.886
here to cook all these
different things all the time.

22:00.887 --> 22:03.389
We start with bird's nest soup.

22:03.390 --> 22:06.291
A delicacy to which I
am usually immune.

22:06.292 --> 22:09.060
This one is unusually flavorful.

22:09.061 --> 22:13.532
These are swallow's nests
from high up on cliffs.

22:13.533 --> 22:16.735
They're soaked in water, cooked

22:16.736 --> 22:20.906
in chicken stock, and
served with crab meat.

22:20.907 --> 22:23.241
A symbol of purity, nobility and

Patience from a nearby lake.

22:28.114 --> 22:28.715
Steamed.

22:28.716 --> 22:30.616
Crab row is mixed with red

22:30.617 --> 22:33.419
onion, pepper, and seasoning
and added to the soup.

22:33.420 --> 22:41.420
And simmered.

22:50.336 --> 22:53.939
The symbolic and health aspects
of many of these dishes

22:53.940 --> 22:55.507
not to be overlooked.

22:55.508 --> 22:59.578
This is fantastic.

22:59.579 --> 23:00.112
Lovely.

23:00.113 --> 23:04.015
How does hue differ from
the rest of Vietnam?

23:04.016 --> 23:10.288
A wonderful architecture,
and very quiet people.

23:10.289 --> 23:12.157
If you stay some time in hue,

23:12.158 --> 23:17.163
after some day you feel
quiet, you take your time.

23:42.655 --> 23:46.658
It is a traditional dish
that's seldom made these days

23:46.659 --> 23:47.859
because of the complexity and

23:47.860 --> 23:49.961
the time needed to do it right.

23:49.962 --> 23:51.329
A fish stock is made.

23:51.330 --> 23:54.199
A fish from the perfume river.

23:54.200 --> 23:59.237
Pineapples, onion, chilies,
shallots, and coriander.

23:59.238 --> 24:04.175
A salad of quickly cooked
prongs, rice noodles, ginger,

24:04.176 --> 24:07.546
red chili, garlic.

24:07.547 --> 24:14.319
Layer of rice noodle, banana
flower, then the prongs,

24:14.320 --> 24:14.654
garnishes.

24:14.655 --> 24:16.021
The strained fish stock is

24:16.022 --> 24:18.023
brought to the table with the

24:18.024 --> 24:19.224
salad in separate bowls and

24:19.225 --> 24:27.225
combined just before eating.

24:29.035 --> 24:30.201
Spicy for you?

24:30.202 --> 24:32.704
No, it's good.

24:32.705 --> 24:33.005
I love it.

24:33.005 --> 24:33.873
It is very spicy.

24:33.874 --> 24:36.542
Oh no, I like it.

24:36.543 --> 24:38.877
What I found when I first came

24:38.878 --> 24:42.447
to the this part of the
world, Vietnam particular.

24:42.448 --> 24:46.051
My pallet changed, I need and

24:46.052 --> 24:49.621
elevated level of
chilies and heat.

24:49.622 --> 24:52.524
Much of Vietnamese cooking

24:52.525 --> 24:55.727
abided by principles
of ying and Yang.

24:55.728 --> 24:56.262
Heat and cold.

24:56.263 --> 24:59.965
This one a lobster dish with
five spices balances the

24:59.966 --> 25:04.570
coldness of the lobster with
the heat of the spices.

25:04.571 --> 25:08.574
Red onion ginger, lemongrass is

25:08.575 --> 25:09.941
added to cook the lobster.

25:09.942 --> 25:12.410
Once the lobster's cooked, it's

25:12.411 --> 25:14.312
presented in a bowl
of lime leaves.

25:14.313 --> 25:20.719
And the stock is poured over it.

25:20.720 --> 25:22.087
Whoa.

25:22.088 --> 25:22.589
That's beautiful.

25:22.590 --> 25:25.256
We're getting into this with
our hand, I'm guessing.

25:25.257 --> 25:29.294
I like this.

25:29.295 --> 25:31.396
Beautiful.

25:31.397 --> 25:34.299
The winter sheer unbelievable,
it's very... here

25:34.300 --> 25:37.769
is unbelievable,
very cold and wet.

25:37.770 --> 25:45.770
That's why we have
chili to keep us warm.

25:46.679 --> 25:50.616
Spoils all of with us a
succession of dishes.

25:50.617 --> 25:51.917
But the past as it often does in

25:51.918 --> 25:57.122
a place like this, intrudes.

25:57.123 --> 26:00.425
Its dealt with a
lot of suffering.

26:00.426 --> 26:04.763
The people are very
withdrawn in some ways.

26:04.764 --> 26:09.167
Smiling, but off course as
they remember everything.

26:09.168 --> 26:12.838
They have to remember
the war in 1968.

26:12.839 --> 26:14.640
I was visiting my grandfather's

26:14.641 --> 26:16.642
house, and I got goose bumps

26:16.643 --> 26:18.810
because I knew during the war in

26:18.811 --> 26:21.780
1968 lots of people were killed.

26:21.781 --> 26:25.150
And they were buried on
all the sidewalks there.

26:25.151 --> 26:28.654
And I'd walk around
there and I feel it.

26:28.655 --> 26:36.655
It's dark, it's somber,
and the history is there.

26:38.798 --> 26:41.032
My mom, she never wanted me

26:41.033 --> 26:44.335
to go home after like 10:00.

26:44.336 --> 26:49.007
She get angry if I got home
at 11:00 or something.

26:49.008 --> 26:52.243
When I got home at 9:00.

26:52.244 --> 26:54.880
I tried to go home very early.

26:54.881 --> 26:59.517
Riding a boat along the
river, you sort of feel there

26:59.518 --> 27:01.252
are things living in the water

27:01.253 --> 27:07.159
and in the trees and in
the darkness out there.

27:20.039 --> 27:23.775
Know your enemy they say.

27:23.776 --> 27:27.312
Know who it is you're
facing out there.

27:27.313 --> 27:28.947
Who are they?

27:28.948 --> 27:32.450
Why do they fight?

27:32.451 --> 27:36.254
What are they willing to endure

27:36.255 --> 27:39.024
in the furtherence
of their cause.

27:39.025 --> 27:41.059
These one would think are simple

27:41.060 --> 27:45.630
questions, useful
in any conflict.

27:45.631 --> 27:48.466
Meet the enemy.

27:48.467 --> 27:48.667
Okay.

27:48.668 --> 27:50.769
He was only an infant during our

27:50.770 --> 27:58.309
nine year long war, but
his experience should be

27:58.310 --> 28:06.310
instructive.

28:14.994 --> 28:18.396
In 1965:00 with the united
states initiated a sustained

28:18.397 --> 28:21.166
bombing campaign called
rolling thunder.

28:21.167 --> 28:23.134
Hoping to destroy an elusive

28:23.135 --> 28:28.740
enemy in villages like this one.

28:28.741 --> 28:30.675
Vinh Moc which was less than 20

28:30.676 --> 28:36.614
miles from marine fire bases
just south of the DMZ.

28:36.615 --> 28:37.183
This is where he was born.

28:37.184 --> 28:40.351
As the target of frequent
bombings, the village of Vinh

28:40.352 --> 28:41.787
Moc moved underground.

28:41.788 --> 28:46.425
Up to 100 feet down
into darkness.

28:53.465 --> 28:54.433
The villagers carved over

28:54.434 --> 28:58.169
5,000 feet of tunnels
out of the earth.

28:58.170 --> 28:59.005
Creating a complex that would

28:59.006 --> 29:01.773
house all 90 families
of Vinh Moc.

29:01.774 --> 29:03.508
13 entrances and exits leading

29:03.509 --> 29:09.380
from the inland to the beach.

29:09.381 --> 29:13.318
Showing me through the
labyrinth.

29:13.319 --> 29:18.623
She since moved to the
DMZ to work as a guide.

29:18.624 --> 29:21.226
How did they dispose of all of

29:21.227 --> 29:25.463
this earth at rock without
revealing the tunnels?

29:25.464 --> 29:28.333
The craters, the craters were

29:28.334 --> 29:29.235
everywhere on the landscape of

29:29.236 --> 29:31.002
the moon, and you know, the dirt

29:31.003 --> 29:32.871
of the craters are so fresh,

29:32.872 --> 29:38.009
look new, so they
just left them there.

29:38.010 --> 29:39.577
This was the maternity
ward where Todd was born.

29:39.578 --> 29:41.012
Where did people sleep?

29:41.013 --> 29:42.080
They have sleeping places.

29:42.081 --> 29:44.749
Just like this, but smaller.

29:44.750 --> 29:49.055
Two square meters only,
just enough to put a bed.

29:56.762 --> 30:00.665
How long did it take to build?

30:00.666 --> 30:02.067
20 months of digging.

30:02.068 --> 30:04.870
20 months of digging.

30:04.871 --> 30:05.104
By hand.

30:05.105 --> 30:07.472
The farmer dug with their tools.

30:07.473 --> 30:07.940
Right.

30:07.941 --> 30:09.107
Under the bombing.

30:09.108 --> 30:11.442
While the bombing is going

30:11.443 --> 30:13.445
on, they're down here
digging this out.

30:31.630 --> 30:32.531
Wow.

30:32.532 --> 30:37.436
How many children here?

30:44.076 --> 30:49.148
How did they play?

30:52.418 --> 30:55.586
So much of the time you
were in total darkness.

30:55.587 --> 30:56.255
Yeah.

30:56.256 --> 30:57.722
You can't see your mother.

30:57.723 --> 31:00.658
Some people say that even

31:00.659 --> 31:02.627
when the parents, you know, fit

31:02.628 --> 31:04.829
the children, they need to touch

31:04.830 --> 31:09.500
their face and find their
mouth and feed them.

31:09.501 --> 31:11.669
Wow.

31:11.670 --> 31:14.272
Children played here.

31:14.273 --> 31:16.007
But people also emerged from

31:16.008 --> 31:18.977
these tunnels to kill
or cripple Americans.

31:18.978 --> 31:24.315
To shoot them, to plant Bobby

31:24.316 --> 31:27.118
traps, and that's what
they did... booby traps.

31:27.119 --> 31:28.186
And that's what they did.

31:28.187 --> 31:34.926
Six years in darkness.

31:34.927 --> 31:38.496
And at the end of the war, the

31:38.497 --> 31:41.766
people of Vinh Moc emerged
from the darkness.

31:41.767 --> 31:49.767
And what did they do?

32:07.393 --> 32:08.726
What was that like after living

32:08.727 --> 32:09.995
in darkness for so long?

32:09.996 --> 32:11.729
What was it like to come out and

32:11.730 --> 32:15.734
be able to spend the rest
of his life in the sun?

32:47.733 --> 32:50.401
Thank you, wow, ready.

32:50.402 --> 32:51.070
Thank you.

32:51.071 --> 32:55.573
Looks kind of like a mackerel.

32:55.574 --> 32:55.774
Good.

32:55.774 --> 32:56.542
Good?

32:56.542 --> 32:57.176
Yeah.

32:57.177 --> 33:00.345
Really?

33:00.346 --> 33:01.446
Yes.

33:01.447 --> 33:03.881
Last question, hypothetical,

33:03.882 --> 33:05.716
if the French or the Japanese,

33:05.717 --> 33:10.388
or the Americans, suddenly
decided they wanted for some

33:10.389 --> 33:12.691
reason to come back,
would he fight?

33:26.305 --> 33:30.541
That's different.

33:30.542 --> 33:33.945
They're all welcome
if they're tourists.

33:49.828 --> 33:50.796
There are particular sounds

33:50.797 --> 33:57.435
that come with waking
up in rice country.

33:57.436 --> 34:00.238
At lagoon however, early

34:00.239 --> 34:04.309
morning... lagoon however,
it is the end of a workday.

34:04.310 --> 34:07.478
As fishermen who have been out

34:07.479 --> 34:15.478
on the water and sell their
catch in the early mist.

34:39.678 --> 34:47.678
I'm meeting up for a
tasty afternoon snack.

34:47.819 --> 34:49.620
It is set back from a quiet Lane

34:49.621 --> 34:51.656
in the outskirts of town.

34:51.657 --> 34:58.496
It's a neighborhood place
specializing in this.

34:58.497 --> 35:00.465
Little pancake-like things made

35:00.466 --> 35:03.067
of rice flour, steamed in molds,

35:03.068 --> 35:06.304
and topped with crispy fried

35:06.305 --> 35:11.075
shallots and crumbled
fried shrimp.

35:11.076 --> 35:14.312
Show me how you eat this.

35:14.313 --> 35:16.647
I have this when I
was a little girl.

35:16.648 --> 35:18.749
So you try to pick
it up like this.

35:18.750 --> 35:19.318
Right.

35:19.318 --> 35:20.085
I got it.

35:20.086 --> 35:22.487
Just cut around the edge here.

35:22.488 --> 35:24.655
I feel so clumsy.

35:24.656 --> 35:27.725
Its been a while.

35:27.726 --> 35:32.830
Fold it over.

35:32.831 --> 35:36.667
Oh it just... mm.

35:36.668 --> 35:39.237
This is great.

35:39.238 --> 35:47.238
This is so nostalgic to me.

35:48.847 --> 35:51.516
I will sit there in front
of our house... waiting.

35:51.517 --> 35:55.953
Waiting for her, with a dish,
she would come and my mom

35:55.954 --> 36:00.291
would buy for me.

36:00.292 --> 36:03.194
At the end of the day,
we see who eat the most.

36:03.195 --> 36:07.398
Good, glad I'm fitting in here.

36:07.399 --> 36:10.468
What do they have
in the banana leaf?

36:10.469 --> 36:12.370
Are we having one of those too?

36:12.371 --> 36:14.205
We have everything.

36:14.206 --> 36:16.707
I don't want to
leave anything out.

36:16.708 --> 36:19.377
It's made of tap yolka with

36:19.378 --> 36:21.812
pork and shrimp from the lagoon,

36:21.813 --> 36:26.551
wrapped like a tamale in
banana leaf, then steamed.

36:26.552 --> 36:31.121
So, you can open.

36:31.122 --> 36:34.392
In Vietnam, we learn how
to unwrap the thing.

36:34.393 --> 36:36.561
So unwrap with these.

36:36.562 --> 36:39.163
Cause I'm watching you.

36:39.164 --> 36:39.631
Let's get this right.

36:46.738 --> 36:50.074

you were born here.

36:50.075 --> 36:52.443
In a past life.

36:52.444 --> 36:54.345
So this is shrimp.

36:54.346 --> 36:59.950
Pick it up and dip.

36:59.951 --> 37:00.252
Hmm.

37:00.252 --> 37:00.786
Very nice.

37:00.787 --> 37:02.453
They're pretty too.

37:02.454 --> 37:05.856

37:05.857 --> 37:07.091
You can see what's inside.

37:07.092 --> 37:11.362

of eating an-choi.

37:11.363 --> 37:14.098
It's like for fun or playing.

37:14.099 --> 37:16.767
Recreational eating.

Yeah.

37:18.504 --> 37:22.607
So it's not a main meal.

37:22.608 --> 37:23.041
It's for snacking.

37:23.042 --> 37:26.844
Sticky rice dumplings.

37:26.845 --> 37:30.781
Started with frying the
paste in cooking oil.

37:30.782 --> 37:35.119
Then unpeeled shrimp are
stuffed into dough.

37:35.120 --> 37:37.388

37:37.389 --> 37:41.292
crunchy part and sprinkle
with chopped, fried shrimp.

37:41.293 --> 37:44.194
Oh, wow, that is awesome.

37:44.195 --> 37:45.896
What is underneath?

37:45.897 --> 37:47.898
Rice base.

37:47.899 --> 37:48.334
Oh, okay.

37:48.335 --> 37:52.002
But on the top is thin.

37:52.003 --> 37:53.338
At the back.

37:53.339 --> 37:54.972
Oh, that's great.

Nice and crispy and greasy.
