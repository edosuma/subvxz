the Fourth of July a holiday.

07:38.834 --> 07:41.211
Well, we did have
a couple of bumps.

07:43.130 --> 07:45.090
I was driving,
and I saw a couple of runners,

07:45.174 --> 07:47.217
and it took me right back
to that place.

07:47.301 --> 07:49.720
But we talked about it,

07:49.803 --> 07:53.390

we got through it okay.

07:53.473 --> 07:54.975
Yeah.

And I was glad
that he brought it up.

07:57.186 --> 07:58.645
Great.

07:58.729 --> 08:00.731
You're discussing things
as they come up.

08:01.773 --> 08:04.943
So, how did things go
as far as physical intimacy?

08:06.445 --> 08:07.905
We're hugging more.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.533
Have we moved past hugging yet?

08:13.035 --> 08:16.288
You have indicated to me
that physical intimacy is

08:16.371 --> 08:19.583
what both of you want, and
there has been no progression.

08:20.751 --> 08:23.503
It's just that it's been
really busy at the restaurant.

08:24.546 --> 08:27.799

doesn't make us all friends.

without being married.
