<i>Previously on </i>Desperate Housewives.

00:02.208 --> 00:04.625
<i>Lynette made excuses.</i>

00:04.709 --> 00:07.083
The restaurant did close
a half hour ago.

00:07.166 --> 00:09.166
We're doing inventory.

00:09.250 --> 00:12.375
<i>- Carlos made a friend.</i>
- Nothing better than family.

00:12.458 --> 00:14.834
<i>And Edie made a pass.</i>

00:14.917 --> 00:16.709
<i>Victor popped the question.</i>

00:16.792 --> 00:18.709
Will you marry me?

00:18.792 --> 00:20.500
<i>Susan let Mike down.</i>

00:20.583 --> 00:23.041
- I love you.
- But you love him a little bit more.

00:23.125 --> 00:25.375
<i>- And Ian...</i>
- Goodbye, Susan.

00:25.458 --> 00:27.959
<i>...let Susan go.</i>

00:31.291 --> 00:34.375
<i>It can happen to anyone.</i>

00:34.458 --> 00:37.500
<i>An old woman hears</i>
<i>suspicious footsteps</i>

00:37.583 --> 00:40.166
<i>as she walks down the street.</i>

00:40.875 --> 00:46.000
<i>A businessman sees</i>
<i>a reflection in his car window.</i>

00:46.709 --> 00:51.417
<i>A shop owner feels a blade press</i>
<i>against his back.</i>

00:52.417 --> 00:57.542
<i>And in that instant, an ordinary person</i>

00:58.417 --> 01:02.542
<i>is transformed into a victim.</i>

01:02.625 --> 01:07.000
<i>And a world that seemed so safe</i>

01:07.083 --> 01:11.583
<i>is suddenly filled with danger.</i>

01:14.083 --> 01:17.166
So this little ear-shaped pasta
is called...

01:17.250 --> 01:21.625
Orecchiette.
And the cubes of bacon are pancetta.

01:21.750 --> 01:23.125
Thank God for Italian.

01:23.208 --> 01:26.792
You can charge way more
for orecchiette with pancetta,

01:26.875 --> 01:30.375
than you'd ever get for bacon
and little ears.

01:33.125 --> 01:35.375
Thank you.

01:37.917 --> 01:39.875
This is nice.

01:39.959 --> 01:41.917
Doesn't need more garlic?

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
No, I mean everything.

01:45.083 --> 01:48.792
The food, the wine, you.

01:50.291 --> 01:53.333
I swear, there are times this is
all that gets me through my day.

01:53.417 --> 01:57.125
Knowing, at the end of it,
I get to steal this little half hour

01:57.208 --> 02:01.583
where I'm not a mom or a wife
or a pizza slave.

02:01.667 --> 02:07.917
I'm just a tired lady with a nice man
who cooks for her.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.083
Well, it's the highlight of my day, too.

02:15.458 --> 02:17.458
Sorry, guys. We're closed.

02:17.542 --> 02:20.917
Yeah, we know.
Put your cell phones on the table.

02:22.083 --> 02:24.375
Oh, crap.

02:26.291 --> 02:29.792
Get in there! Don't make any noise!

02:29.875 --> 02:33.250
Oh, my God.

02:33.333 --> 02:38.959
Oh, my God. They locked us in here,

02:39.041 --> 02:42.917
and it's 42 degrees.
We're gonna freeze to death.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.333
Listen, don't panic.

02:44.417 --> 02:47.333
I'm sure when you don't come home,
Tom will come looking for you.

02:47.417 --> 02:49.583
No, he won't,
he takes a pain pill at 10:00.

02:49.667 --> 02:53.208
He's probably already asleep. Jeez.

02:53.917 --> 02:57.625
How are we gonna
make it through the night in here?

02:57.709 --> 03:01.875
<i>Yes, in the moment it takes to bolt</i>
<i>a freezer door,</i>

03:01.959 --> 03:04.542
<i>ordinary people can become victims.</i>

03:06.583 --> 03:07.834
That better?

03:07.917 --> 03:10.834
<i>And a world that seemed so safe...</i>

03:10.917 --> 03:14.583
Yeah, that helps.

03:14.667 --> 03:19.709
<i>...is suddenly filled with danger.</i>

03:26.709 --> 03:31.917
<i>At the exact same moment his wife</i>
<i>was being locked in a freezer,</i>

03:32.000 --> 03:34.750
<i>Tom Scavo was having a nightmare</i>

03:34.834 --> 03:38.875
<i>about monsters</i>
<i>trying to destroy his home.</i>

03:38.959 --> 03:42.834
<i>But it wasn't until he woke up</i>
<i>the next morning</i>

03:42.917 --> 03:46.041
<i>that his real nightmare began.</i>

04:01.917 --> 04:04.125
You awake?

04:04.583 --> 04:06.333
Yeah.

04:07.542 --> 04:10.667
Did you sleep at all?

04:10.750 --> 04:15.333
A little. Thanks for not letting me
freeze last night.

04:15.417 --> 04:18.542
You kidding me?
You're the one who kept me warm.

04:18.625 --> 04:21.709
You don't have a fever, do you?

04:21.834 --> 04:24.792
No, that's just me.

04:24.959 --> 04:27.709
Tom's always kicking
the covers off the bed.

04:28.208 --> 04:31.709
He calls me his little blonde furnace.

04:31.792 --> 04:33.792
He's a lucky guy.

04:40.667 --> 04:42.959
Lynette!

04:45.917 --> 04:49.083
Tom! In here!

04:55.041 --> 04:57.250
- Thank God!
- We were robbed!

04:57.333 --> 05:00.917
I don't care about that. Are you okay?
Were you hurt?

05:01.000 --> 05:03.208
No, I'm fine. No, no, I'm just cold.

05:03.291 --> 05:06.542
I was so worried about you.

05:06.625 --> 05:09.166
If you knew the places
that my mind has been.

05:09.250 --> 05:10.709
I'm sorry. I would have called,

05:10.792 --> 05:14.208
but they took our cell phones
before they locked us in there.

05:14.291 --> 05:17.041
- Us?
- Hey.

05:21.125 --> 05:23.375
Hey.

05:24.625 --> 05:27.125
I can't believe one dress
could cost so much.

05:27.208 --> 05:29.917
Well, I want to look fabulous tonight
when Victor is elected mayor.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.667
Isn't it bad luck to buy a dress
for a victory party before the election?

05:33.750 --> 05:37.458
Vern, focus. It's never bad luck
when I look fabulous.

05:37.542 --> 05:39.750
Oh, hi. Don't worry. I'm here, now.

05:39.834 --> 05:41.667
Yeah, but your meter just expired.

05:41.750 --> 05:43.250
I want to put another quarter in.

05:43.583 --> 05:45.959
Oh, no. I'm just gonna say bye
to my friend, then I'm gone.

05:46.041 --> 05:48.625
This whole thing is crazy.
I go on one gay cruise

05:48.709 --> 05:50.709
and come home to find you engaged
to some rich politician.

05:50.792 --> 05:53.125
Oh, Vern,
I can't wait for you to meet him.

05:53.208 --> 05:57.625
He's everything I've ever wanted
in a man. Sensitive and kind...

05:57.709 --> 06:01.083
- And buys you $3,000 dresses.
- Buys me $3,000 dresses.

06:01.166 --> 06:03.417
And he's totally fine with you
being a high-maintenance nightmare.

06:03.500 --> 06:07.250
Oh, my God, that's the best part.
He lets me be me.

06:07.333 --> 06:10.667
All right, I gotta get going.
See you later.

06:12.208 --> 06:15.583
What are you doing?
I told you I was leaving. Stop writing!

06:15.667 --> 06:18.500
Yeah, but you weren't leaving.
You were flapping your gums.

06:18.583 --> 06:22.041
Give me a break! I was standing right
there. You could've said something.

06:22.125 --> 06:25.125
I told you to put a quarter in.
Spoiled bitch.

06:25.458 --> 06:28.000
You can't talk to me like that!

06:29.875 --> 06:32.208
Forty dollars?
Think I'm going to pay that?

06:32.291 --> 06:36.166
No, I'm guessing it'd be the sap
that bought you that $3,000 dress.

06:46.875 --> 06:51.000
Hey, Carlos! Wait! Hi.

06:51.083 --> 06:54.875
Look, there's some crazy rumour
going around that Mike moved.

06:54.959 --> 06:58.000
It's true. He went on a little trip,
and then he's heading back east.

06:58.083 --> 07:00.333
Oh, my God. Where is he now?

07:01.542 --> 07:04.000
Okay, look, I know that I put Mike
through the ringer.

07:04.083 --> 07:07.000
But that's why I have to talk to him,
to make it right.

07:07.083 --> 07:09.667
- He's not answering his cell phone.
- He turned it off.

07:09.750 --> 07:13.667
- He said he wanted to clear his head.
- Carlos, tell me where to find him.

07:15.208 --> 07:20.083
I'm sorry, Susan. Look, you know
what they say, bros before hos.

07:20.208 --> 07:22.333
"They" say it. I don't.

07:22.417 --> 07:27.000
Come on. Just for my peace of mind.
I have to know he's okay.

07:27.166 --> 07:29.542
- I don't know...
- What am I gonna do?

07:29.625 --> 07:32.917
Go hunt him down? I have a daughter.
I have responsibilities.

07:33.000 --> 07:39.000
Okay, he hiked to the hot springs
at Pinewood Valley State Forest.

07:39.083 --> 07:42.875
Okay, Julie, I'm out of here.
Here's 40 bucks on the counter.

07:42.959 --> 07:44.333
Are you sure this is a good idea?

07:44.417 --> 07:46.875
Yes, if I don't find Mike
before he's off that mountain,

07:46.959 --> 07:48.083
I may never see him again.

07:48.166 --> 07:49.959
Okay, what you're doing
is nauseatingly romantic,

07:50.041 --> 07:51.667
but how do you know
he even wants to see you?

07:51.750 --> 07:53.792
I mean, after the whole,
"I choose Ian" thing?

07:53.875 --> 07:55.000
That's why I have to go.

07:55.083 --> 07:57.667
I have to make amends
and heal his broken heart.

07:57.750 --> 07:59.834
Okay, well, what if his devastation
has turned to anger,

07:59.917 --> 08:02.041
and he's burning pictures of you
in his campfire?

08:03.583 --> 08:06.959
Well, what else can I do? I love him.
I have to go.

08:11.750 --> 08:13.250
Then go.

08:22.834 --> 08:27.417
- Strike three! You're out of there!
- Again? How are you beating me?

08:27.500 --> 08:30.208
You got someone in there
greasing the ball for you?

08:30.291 --> 08:32.208
Hey, come on, Travers,
you can take him!

08:32.291 --> 08:33.917
Go for the soft underbelly!

08:34.000 --> 08:36.792
Soft? What are you talking about?
I'm all muscle.

08:36.875 --> 08:40.125
- Travers, feel that bicep.
- Mom's is harder.

08:40.208 --> 08:41.792
Well, thank you, sweetheart.

08:41.875 --> 08:44.959
Fine, I can take a hint.
I need a little exercise.

08:45.041 --> 08:48.959
So how about we go
to the batting cages and hit a few?

08:49.041 --> 08:50.458
- Cool!
- Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:50.542 --> 08:54.166
We were supposed to go to the movies.
How about batting cages on Saturday?

08:54.250 --> 08:55.500
Sounds great.

08:55.583 --> 08:59.834
Yeah, we'll get to find out who hits
the ball harder, you or Mom.

08:59.917 --> 09:02.500
You are so going down. Come here.

09:03.375 --> 09:06.375
Hey, who the hell is that?

09:11.166 --> 09:13.000
Hello, Edie.

09:15.750 --> 09:18.041
Travers.

09:18.125 --> 09:19.875
It's your dad.

09:23.750 --> 09:25.333
Kenya was amazing.

09:25.417 --> 09:28.709
And being a part of Doctors Without
Borders was so rewarding.

09:28.875 --> 09:32.333
But I can't do it again.
Not with the time commitment.

09:32.417 --> 09:36.125
I'm gonna have to wait
until this little guy is in college.

09:37.125 --> 09:39.709
So when are you taking Travers home?

09:39.792 --> 09:41.125
Not till tomorrow.

09:41.208 --> 09:44.917
I'm speaking at a conference in Hilldale
this afternoon.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.875
And if you're hungry,
I'm buying you breakfast.

09:47.959 --> 09:50.375
- That'd be great!
- All right.

09:50.458 --> 09:52.834
I'll help you get dressed.

09:56.625 --> 10:00.792
You know, if you want to take
a couple days and chill,

10:00.875 --> 10:04.000
Edie and I would be more than happy
to keep looking after Travers.

10:04.083 --> 10:08.417
Oh, thanks,
but we should probably get back home.

10:08.500 --> 10:10.208
Right.

10:10.834 --> 10:14.041
The thing is, we kind of made plans

10:14.125 --> 10:16.250
to take him to the batting cage
on Saturday.

10:16.333 --> 10:20.750
Oh, sorry. Well, maybe you can take
him the next time he visits.

10:20.834 --> 10:22.750
Yeah.

10:24.291 --> 10:26.917
And when do you think that'll be?

10:27.000 --> 10:31.667
I don't know.
I'll have to check my schedule.

10:34.834 --> 10:39.041
I don't mean to sound pushy.
It's just, the three of us,

10:39.125 --> 10:41.917
we've been having a lot of fun together.

10:42.000 --> 10:47.250
Well, look at the bright side, you'll
have a lot more time alone with Edie.

10:48.834 --> 10:53.083
Yeah, that is good.

10:54.500 --> 10:58.875
Here you go, Officer. I cued it up
to the clearest shot of the guy.

10:58.959 --> 11:02.333
Thank God you made me spring
for that surveillance camera.

11:02.417 --> 11:04.750
I wanted to spend the money
on a pinball machine.

11:10.750 --> 11:12.500
Son of a bitch!

11:12.583 --> 11:14.917
I think these are the same guys
that hit a couple of diners

11:15.000 --> 11:16.291
out in Mount Vernon.

11:16.375 --> 11:18.917
- You mind if I rewind?
- No.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.792
I wanna see the exact time
they came in.

11:23.458 --> 11:26.333
Oh, whoops. Overshot it a little.

11:41.792 --> 11:45.250
I was doing receipts and Rick surprised
me with this great idea for the menu.

11:45.333 --> 11:46.667
It's called... What are they called?

11:46.750 --> 11:49.834
- Orecchiette. It means little...
- I know what it means.

11:49.917 --> 11:53.875
And he makes them with pancetta
and garlic and olive oil.

11:53.959 --> 11:57.917
It's really, really good.
It's gonna be our special tonight.

11:59.291 --> 12:01.458
So the door was unlocked?

12:02.166 --> 12:04.291
You need to be more careful.

12:04.375 --> 12:07.792
The two of you
were just asking for trouble.

12:08.250 --> 12:11.041
Yeah, I guess we were.

12:12.750 --> 12:15.959
Quiet, quiet!
They're about to announce.

12:16.041 --> 12:17.417
<i>...Valley Ridge is too close to call.</i>

12:17.500 --> 12:20.625
<i>However, we're now projecting</i>
<i>a winner in Fairview.</i>

12:20.750 --> 12:21.917
<i>It's Victor Lang by 10%.</i>

12:29.667 --> 12:35.166
- Speech! Speech!
- Speech! Speech!

12:35.959 --> 12:38.917
Thank you all. I couldn't have done it
without any of you.

12:39.000 --> 12:42.208
I would especially like to thank
my beautiful fiancée, Gabrielle.

12:42.291 --> 12:45.333
And I will as soon as the feeling returns
to my lower back.

12:45.417 --> 12:49.709
Sir, the mayor's on the phone.
Sounds like he wants to concede.

12:54.625 --> 12:57.000
- Gabrielle! Congratulations!
- Thank you.

12:57.083 --> 12:58.709
Your husband
runs a hell of a campaign.

12:58.792 --> 13:00.875
We're so excited for Victor.

13:00.959 --> 13:02.208
What a day, huh?

13:02.291 --> 13:04.667
Well, it is ending a lot
better than it started.

13:04.750 --> 13:06.000
What happened?

13:06.083 --> 13:09.041
This morning I got in a fight
with a parking cop over a ticket.

13:09.125 --> 13:10.291
The guy was a total jerk.

13:10.375 --> 13:13.500
Well, your days of dealing
with that crap are over.

13:13.583 --> 13:17.542
- What do you mean?
- Mayor Johnson's wife, Sydney.

13:17.625 --> 13:21.375
She's been collecting parking tickets
like bubble gum cards for years.

13:21.458 --> 13:24.291
Just gives them to her husband.
They disappear.

13:24.875 --> 13:25.917
Keep talking.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.500
Honey, you are no longer
one of the little people.

13:29.583 --> 13:34.625
Forget jury duty, speeding tickets.
You rule this town now.

13:38.583 --> 13:43.291
Well, he conceded. I'm the mayor.
You ready to be the mayor's wife?

13:43.792 --> 13:46.375
Am I ever.

13:49.208 --> 13:50.333
Knock, knock.

13:50.750 --> 13:54.125
Hey. Where's Travers?

13:54.208 --> 13:59.083
His dad's helping him pack.
God, I'm gonna miss that little guy.

13:59.166 --> 14:03.208
- It has been so much fun.
- Yeah. It was.

14:06.208 --> 14:08.542
You're gonna miss him, too,
aren't you?

14:10.458 --> 14:12.667
I know what would cheer us up.

14:12.750 --> 14:17.250
A weekend getaway, just the two of us.
How's that sound?

14:17.333 --> 14:19.250
Actually, I'm busy this weekend.

14:19.333 --> 14:24.917
Really? I thought we had plans
to go to the batting cage.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.667
But that was gonna take
a couple of hours,

14:26.750 --> 14:28.000
and I'm swamped with work.

14:28.083 --> 14:32.500
Since when? You spend every day
hanging out with me and Travers.

14:32.583 --> 14:34.041
Exactly. I've been putting off my work

14:34.125 --> 14:36.166
so that I could be there
to help you with him.

14:36.250 --> 14:38.959
Now it's time for me to buckle down.

14:39.041 --> 14:42.792
So what does that mean
for you and me?

14:45.709 --> 14:48.625
We're still gonna see each other.

14:48.709 --> 14:54.959
Look, I was thinking for your birthday
that we could go to that new oyster bar.

14:55.041 --> 14:59.417
- My birthday's two weeks from now.
- Yeah. It'll be my treat.

15:00.792 --> 15:04.125
Great. Looking forward to it

15:04.208 --> 15:07.542
for the next 14 days.

15:07.625 --> 15:11.500
Hey, don't let Travers leave
without saying goodbye to me.

15:12.667 --> 15:14.625
I wouldn't dream of it.

15:15.083 --> 15:17.959
I know how much he means to you.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.333
Hi, there.

15:28.417 --> 15:31.458
Can I get a map to the hot springs?
I'm gonna hike up there.

15:31.542 --> 15:32.875
No problem. You got gear?

15:32.959 --> 15:35.750
- Yup.
- That's not gear.

15:35.834 --> 15:38.750
- Why not?
- It's tiny, ma'am. And pink.

15:38.834 --> 15:42.375
Well, it's my daughter's.
The whole junior class has them.

15:42.458 --> 15:46.125
Does the junior class have
compasses, too? Trail shoes? Tents?

15:46.208 --> 15:47.417
Why would I need a tent?

15:47.500 --> 15:49.667
It's a two-day hike to reach the springs.

15:49.750 --> 15:51.250
Two days?

15:52.959 --> 15:55.458
Well, can't I just drive part of the way
and then hike from there?

15:55.542 --> 15:57.834
That's not really
how nature works, ma'am.

15:57.917 --> 15:59.542
There are trails, not roads.

16:01.542 --> 16:06.250
Well, maybe I am a little unprepared,
but it'll be fine. I work out.

16:06.333 --> 16:07.583
I have quads of steel.

16:07.667 --> 16:09.291
I'm sorry, I just can't let you
go up there...

16:09.375 --> 16:11.208
Can't? There's no "can't" in love!

16:11.291 --> 16:14.458
There's a man on that mountain that I
intend to spend the rest of my life with.

16:14.542 --> 16:16.125
And nothing is gonna
keep me from him!

16:16.208 --> 16:20.291
Not fate, not destiny
and definitely not you!

16:20.375 --> 16:22.041
To finish my thought, ma'am.

16:22.125 --> 16:25.834
I can't let you go up there alone.
You'll need a guide.

16:28.709 --> 16:32.208
Cool. How do I get one of those?

16:32.291 --> 16:34.667
Toni, I got a hiker for you!

16:38.917 --> 16:43.750
This is Toni.
And those are quads of steel.

16:45.834 --> 16:49.458
Thanks for suggesting we do this.
I've always wanted to try this place.

16:49.542 --> 16:51.500
Well, you've been working for me
for over a month,

16:51.583 --> 16:55.083
and I figured it was time
we got acquainted.

16:55.166 --> 17:00.375
- So much I don't know about you.
- I'll be happy to fill in the blanks.

17:00.458 --> 17:02.917
What would you like to know?

17:03.000 --> 17:05.792
Well, for starters,

17:07.917 --> 17:10.417
are you sleeping with my wife?

17:10.917 --> 17:14.834
What? No, Tom, of course not.

17:14.917 --> 17:18.000
Okay, so you're just hoping
to sleep with her?

17:18.083 --> 17:21.000
If this is about the video, I swear,
I was just trying out a new recipe...

17:21.083 --> 17:23.583
Don't give me the recipe line.
I am not an idiot.

17:27.750 --> 17:30.375
The truth is that Lynette and I
have been going through

17:30.458 --> 17:32.417
sort of a rough patch.

17:32.500 --> 17:35.083
Yeah, she told me about that.

17:36.291 --> 17:40.208
And then you came along and wham,
it's the perfect storm.

17:40.291 --> 17:43.291
You're young, good-looking, sensitive.

17:43.375 --> 17:47.417
Way more fun than five screaming kids
and a cranky, invalid husband.

17:47.500 --> 17:50.291
Tom, seriously, nothing has happened.

17:50.375 --> 17:54.959
And nothing is going to.
Because you are gonna quit.

17:55.041 --> 17:59.750
Quit? No, I'm not gonna do that.

17:59.834 --> 18:02.792
You want me gone, fire me.

18:02.875 --> 18:06.667
Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you?
Have Lynette fight for you,

18:06.750 --> 18:10.917
while I'm the jealous jerk
who can't trust his wife.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.625
No, you have to quit.

18:16.291 --> 18:19.709
I'm staying as long as Lynette
wants me there.

18:19.792 --> 18:24.625
And make no mistake,
she wants me there.

18:26.208 --> 18:30.542
Buddy, you're not thinking
this thing through.

18:30.625 --> 18:34.667
Because Lynette will never leave
her family.

18:34.750 --> 18:36.250
So the best, maybe the very best

18:36.333 --> 18:39.458
that you can hope for
is to catch her in a weak moment

18:39.542 --> 18:42.667
and leave a wound in her marriage
that will take years to heal.

18:42.750 --> 18:46.375
But it will heal.

18:46.458 --> 18:49.458
Because I will stand by her,
and I will love her just as hard

18:49.542 --> 18:52.333
as she hates herself for what she did.

18:54.917 --> 18:57.583
You still feel like sticking around?

18:59.667 --> 19:02.291
Can I get you some more bread?

19:02.375 --> 19:05.667
No, I think I've had just about enough.

19:15.333 --> 19:19.625
I mean, the doctor said that Mike
might never come out of the coma.

19:19.709 --> 19:22.083
And then when he did,
he didn't even remember me.

19:22.166 --> 19:24.583
Do you need to rest a second?
You sound winded.

19:24.667 --> 19:27.583
No, no, I'm invigorated.
This fresh mountain air is...

19:30.041 --> 19:31.333
A little help.

19:34.959 --> 19:38.375
So, anyway,
the whole situation with Mike,

19:38.458 --> 19:40.667
it just seemed hopeless.

19:40.750 --> 19:43.583
That's when I decided
to take a chance with Ian.

19:43.667 --> 19:45.875
Ian is the British guy
whose heart you crushed?

19:46.500 --> 19:50.583
Yeah. What was I supposed to do,
wait forever for Mike?

19:53.500 --> 19:57.834
No, seriously, I was asking.
What would you have done?

19:57.917 --> 20:00.041
I would have waited for him.

20:00.125 --> 20:02.458
Well, clearly you were
not paying attention.

20:02.542 --> 20:04.917
Because I did go back to Mike
the second he woke up,

20:05.000 --> 20:09.250
and he had totally forgotten me!
But none of that matters any more...

20:14.458 --> 20:16.208
Bug.

20:17.333 --> 20:20.709
You know, the bugs can't get in
if you keep your mouth shut.

20:27.709 --> 20:29.792
Travers?

20:30.375 --> 20:33.250
I have someone
who wants to meet you.

20:33.333 --> 20:37.834
- A puppy!
- Yeah, you wanna hold him?

20:38.417 --> 20:40.917
He's awesome.
Are you gonna keep him?

20:41.000 --> 20:44.250
No, he's not mine. He's yours.

20:44.333 --> 20:45.959
- No way!
- Way!

20:46.041 --> 20:50.750
I just rescued him from the pound.
So what you gonna call him?

20:52.000 --> 20:54.083
Fenway. After Fenway Park.

20:54.166 --> 20:58.542
That is so cute. Everybody back home
is gonna be so jealous.

20:59.583 --> 21:04.583
But, Mom, I can't take him home.
Dad's allergic.

21:06.417 --> 21:11.375
That's right. Shoot.

21:11.458 --> 21:14.375
I'm gonna have to take
poor little Fenway back to the pound.

21:14.458 --> 21:17.709
No! Why can't I keep him here?

21:17.834 --> 21:20.333
Well, you don't visit here very often.

21:20.417 --> 21:24.166
And I can't take care of a dog
all by myself.

21:26.291 --> 21:32.000
- Well, I don't know what else to do.
- Why can't I just visit you more?

21:34.834 --> 21:39.333
Hey, that's a thought.
And Carlos would love it, too.

21:39.417 --> 21:42.500
Of course, I don't know how your father
will feel about joint custody.

21:42.583 --> 21:44.917
I'll talk to him. I'll tell him I want it.

21:45.000 --> 21:48.750
Really? Well, that would be great.

21:48.834 --> 21:52.583
But you better make sure that he knows
that it was all your idea, okay?

21:56.583 --> 21:58.542
We're about three hours
from the hot springs.

21:58.625 --> 22:02.208
So if we get an early start tomorrow,
we should be there by lunch.

22:06.375 --> 22:07.625
What are you doing?

22:07.709 --> 22:08.875
It's a face mask.

22:08.959 --> 22:10.709
It's lavender and honey.
You want some?

22:10.792 --> 22:12.917
Honey, huh?

22:13.000 --> 22:14.291
So you're in the middle of the woods

22:14.375 --> 22:17.000
getting ready to smear your face
with bear food?

22:19.125 --> 22:21.583
Well, I wanted to look nice for Mike.

22:24.709 --> 22:28.166
Lord knows I don't want to hear you
talk about this any more,

22:28.250 --> 22:32.792
but what exactly do you think is
gonna happen with you and this guy?

22:34.792 --> 22:39.542
Well, I'm going to apologise

22:39.625 --> 22:44.709
and then I'm gonna tell him
that I made a huge mistake.

22:44.792 --> 22:46.917
No, no, no. After that.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.417
Say he accepts your apology,
you get back together,

22:49.500 --> 22:53.750
and then what happens?
You know, after the novelty wears off.

22:55.709 --> 23:00.583
Well, then we'll just be happy.

23:04.458 --> 23:06.834
Okay, I know it's dark,
but I can see you.

23:06.917 --> 23:10.500
Look, after hearing your whole history
with Mike,

23:10.583 --> 23:13.291
it doesn't take a genius to figure out
what the problem is.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.333
- What is it?
- You.

23:16.417 --> 23:19.250
You don't want to be happy.
You're a drama junkie.

23:19.333 --> 23:23.625
When there is no drama, you create it.
You sleep with your ex-husband,

23:23.709 --> 23:27.291
you cheat on a coma victim,
and now you're hiking up a mountain

23:27.375 --> 23:30.083
after a guy who has no idea
you're coming!

23:32.291 --> 23:36.792
Who knows?
Maybe this guy will take you back.

23:36.875 --> 23:39.417
But once the dust settles,
you'll kick up some more,

23:39.500 --> 23:44.291
because you don't know
how to just be happy.

23:47.583 --> 23:50.333
You don't even know me.
How dare you talk to me like that.

23:50.417 --> 23:55.333
Oh, so dramatic. I'm gonna turn in now.

24:08.709 --> 24:12.166
All right, sunshine, let's get moving.

24:37.041 --> 24:38.667
What are you looking at?

24:38.750 --> 24:42.208
The city. It's like
I'm seeing it for the first time.

24:42.291 --> 24:44.792
Everything looks different
now that I'm First Lady of Fairview.

24:44.875 --> 24:48.125
Oh, my God, you did not just
call yourself First Lady of Fairview.

24:50.500 --> 24:53.917
Well, well, well. Who do we have here?

24:54.000 --> 24:57.166
Wouldn't you just love to rub his nose
in your newfound power?

24:57.250 --> 25:00.417
Vern, you're just awful.

25:00.500 --> 25:03.166
And as it happens, so am I.

25:10.166 --> 25:12.875
Gabby, come on. I was just joking.

25:12.959 --> 25:15.834
Hey, lady, that's a hydrant.
You can't park there.

25:15.917 --> 25:18.000
Really? Because I just did.

25:18.083 --> 25:21.000
- You again.
- Gabby...

25:21.083 --> 25:23.709
Just stand back and enjoy the carnage.

25:24.417 --> 25:28.291
Thank you. Now, what you're about
to see may astound you.

25:33.458 --> 25:36.166
You know, I could give you
another ticket for littering.

25:36.250 --> 25:39.959
You could try, but you might not want
to. See, I'm engaged to Victor Lang.

25:40.041 --> 25:44.583
Ring a bell? The mayor?
Your new boss?

25:44.667 --> 25:48.375
- I don't follow politics.
- Let me know when the carnage begins

25:48.458 --> 25:51.166
so I can shield my eyes.

25:51.250 --> 25:54.875
Listen, buddy! You're not getting it!
You answer to me now!

25:54.959 --> 25:56.625
I could have you fired!

25:56.709 --> 26:00.083
- You can't do nothing!
- I can do whatever I want!

26:00.166 --> 26:04.792
In fact, my first official act of
business as Mayoress of Fairview

26:04.875 --> 26:09.000
is to declare today Free Parking Day!

26:10.125 --> 26:12.583
Hey, knock that off. Hey!

26:14.458 --> 26:17.208
- Free parking!
- Gimme that!

26:17.834 --> 26:19.208
- No.
- Give me that!

26:19.291 --> 26:20.959
Ow, you're hurting me!

26:22.500 --> 26:25.166
Oh, you know what that sound is,
fat boy?

26:25.250 --> 26:27.792
It's the sound of your career
circling the bowl.

26:27.875 --> 26:29.500
Yeah.
You're gonna find out what happens

26:29.583 --> 26:32.542
when you screw
with the First Lady of Fairview.

26:41.917 --> 26:46.291
Okay, north. I need north.

26:46.375 --> 26:50.709
Moss grows on
the north side of trees, so...

26:54.458 --> 26:56.375
What?

27:02.542 --> 27:05.667
Damn it. Stupid mossy tree.

27:16.625 --> 27:19.542
- Dad!
- Hey, buddy!

27:20.291 --> 27:21.542
How are you doing?

27:21.625 --> 27:24.834
Good. Can I ask you a question?

27:24.917 --> 27:27.250
Sure. You can ask me anything.

27:27.333 --> 27:30.500
How would you feel
about joint custody?

27:32.625 --> 27:34.750
You bought him a puppy?

27:34.834 --> 27:37.542
No, I bought myself a puppy.

27:37.625 --> 27:40.125
How was I supposed to know
that he'd get so attached?

27:40.208 --> 27:43.792
Don't lie to me, Edie.
You were trying to manipulate him.

27:43.875 --> 27:47.709
What, would it be so terrible
to have joint custody?

27:47.792 --> 27:50.333
In case you forgot, I am his mother.

27:50.417 --> 27:53.458
Two weeks out of the year.
And that's the way you wanted it!

27:53.542 --> 27:55.834
Well, I changed my mind.

27:55.917 --> 27:58.834
Oh, damn it, Edie!
We had an agreement!

27:58.917 --> 28:00.959
It wasn't official.

28:01.041 --> 28:03.333
And there isn't a judge in this world

28:03.417 --> 28:06.375
that would keep a mother
from her child.

28:11.458 --> 28:13.208
Hey, Travers. What's going on?

28:13.291 --> 28:14.875
Mom and Dad are fighting.

28:14.959 --> 28:17.250
You push me,
I am not afraid to push back.

28:17.333 --> 28:19.291
You wanna go watch TV at my house?

28:20.000 --> 28:22.291
Okay.

28:22.375 --> 28:25.208
I'll see you there in a sec, buddy.

28:25.291 --> 28:28.583
You haul me into court, so help me,
I will destroy you.

28:28.667 --> 28:34.291
You threaten me again and I will go for
full custody, you son of a bitch.

28:38.583 --> 28:40.583
- Oh, hi.
- Hey.

28:40.667 --> 28:45.417
- So what is going on?
- Edie has lost her mind.

28:45.500 --> 28:48.166
For eight years, she's been happy
to see him two weeks a year.

28:48.250 --> 28:51.625
Now, out of the blue,
she's got to have joint custody.

28:51.709 --> 28:53.834
- Really?
- Yeah! How's that supposed to work?

28:53.917 --> 28:55.166
We live four hours away.

28:55.250 --> 28:57.375
What's he gonna do?
Go to two different schools?

29:00.542 --> 29:02.917
I don't know what to tell you, man.
I'm sorry.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.959
Yeah, thanks.

29:08.500 --> 29:10.458
You know, I just don't get it.

29:10.542 --> 29:14.667
Edie's been perfectly happy
with our arrangement.

29:15.083 --> 29:18.500
What the hell's gotten into her?

29:21.500 --> 29:23.458
- Well, thanks.
- Good night.

29:23.542 --> 29:24.959
Come again.

29:25.041 --> 29:30.083
There. Hey. I made you an espresso.

29:30.166 --> 29:33.208
- Great.
- You okay?

29:33.291 --> 29:36.041
You've been so quiet all night.

29:39.208 --> 29:42.375
I had lunch with Tom today.

29:42.458 --> 29:46.125
That's funny. He didn't mention it.

29:46.208 --> 29:48.041
He asked me if I was sleeping with you.

29:50.041 --> 29:51.834
What?

29:53.083 --> 29:56.792
I am so sorry. Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.

29:56.875 --> 29:59.500
That paranoid idiot!
You know, I knew it.

29:59.583 --> 30:02.166
I knew when we were watching
the surveillance tapes

30:02.250 --> 30:05.333
that he would
completely misinterpret it.

30:05.417 --> 30:07.625
- Did he?
- Did he what?

30:07.709 --> 30:10.291
Did he misinterpret it?

30:10.375 --> 30:14.125
Or did he just see what is obvious,
that you and I can't admit?

30:14.208 --> 30:17.208
I don't know what you're talking about.
There's nothing to admit.

30:17.291 --> 30:21.583
Lynette, how long are we going to kid
ourselves? I have feelings for you.

30:21.667 --> 30:23.166
I know you feel something for me.

30:23.250 --> 30:26.792
Stop! Don't say it!
You cannot say these things!

30:26.875 --> 30:29.250
Come on, we both know it's true.
We've been flirting since we met.

30:29.333 --> 30:32.458
Yes, flirting. That's it!
It's what married people do

30:32.542 --> 30:34.583
because we know
there's a line you don't cross.

30:34.667 --> 30:36.750
And maybe I've gotten
close to that line,

30:36.834 --> 30:39.000
and maybe I've enjoyed
getting close to that line,

30:39.083 --> 30:41.792
but I have never once crossed it.

30:41.875 --> 30:43.542
Look, I know
I don't have much to offer...

30:43.625 --> 30:47.125
And I have nothing to offer. I am taken!

30:49.583 --> 30:52.166
Great, great. Now...
Now what, you're mad at me?

30:52.250 --> 30:55.667
Yeah, I'm mad! I am mad
because I loved our nights together!

30:55.750 --> 30:58.417
It made me feel sexy and happy

30:58.500 --> 31:01.375
and God, how I needed that.
And now it's over.

31:01.458 --> 31:03.583
You ruined it!

31:03.667 --> 31:06.083
You can't work here any more.

31:10.041 --> 31:11.458
You're gonna fire me?

31:11.542 --> 31:15.917
Oh, jeez. What choice do I have?

31:16.667 --> 31:17.875
Lynette, Lynette, please...

31:17.959 --> 31:20.375
Don't touch me.

31:20.458 --> 31:23.458
You have to go, now, please. Go.

31:23.542 --> 31:28.875
You have to go, now. Go on. Go.

31:35.542 --> 31:38.208
Her name is Susan Mayer.
She's never hiked before.

31:38.291 --> 31:43.375
Now, this is the last place I saw her,
but honestly, she could be anywhere.

31:43.458 --> 31:46.208
Just checking back in. Name's Delfino.

31:46.291 --> 31:49.250
Delfino. Great, you're all set.

31:49.333 --> 31:50.709
Are you sure she's lost?

31:50.792 --> 31:52.041
Of course I'm sure!

31:52.125 --> 31:54.250
She's a dippy brunette
from the suburbs!

31:54.333 --> 31:57.041
She didn't bring a compass,
she brought makeup.

31:57.125 --> 31:59.750
Wait, is she the one looking
for the guy at the hot springs?

31:59.834 --> 32:01.458
Yep, that's her.

32:01.542 --> 32:03.917
Now, let's go find her
before she falls off a cliff.

32:04.000 --> 32:05.750
The woman is a total klutz!

32:05.834 --> 32:08.083
Yeah, I hear ya.
All right, we'll split up.

32:08.166 --> 32:11.166
I'll take north of the river, here.
You look down in here.

32:12.625 --> 32:14.000
Excuse me.

32:15.834 --> 32:20.417
This klutz, could you tell me her name?

32:39.583 --> 32:43.166
Hey, Mike...

32:43.250 --> 32:47.458
Listen, I know your cell phone's off,
but I...

32:47.542 --> 32:52.375
I wanted you to know that I followed
you up to the hot springs,

32:52.458 --> 32:54.667
and now I'm lost.

32:54.750 --> 32:59.458
You know, on the off chance that
I get devoured by a mountain lion, I...

32:59.542 --> 33:05.291
I just wanted you to know
that I love you.

33:07.125 --> 33:09.709
I've always loved you.

33:11.250 --> 33:16.250
And I don't want any more drama.

33:16.333 --> 33:20.417
And if you take me back,
I promise there won't be.

33:21.917 --> 33:24.125
Unless I get eaten by a mountain lion.

33:24.208 --> 33:26.959
And, you know, that'll be dramatic,
but it won't be my fault.

33:27.041 --> 33:28.917
Anyway...

33:31.041 --> 33:35.125
I hope it's not too late,
but if it is, I just...

33:35.792 --> 33:39.583
I just want you to know
that I am so, so...

33:46.250 --> 33:48.875
Sorry.

34:06.375 --> 34:08.834
Here she is, sir.

34:08.917 --> 34:14.083
No charges, no press,
it never happened.

34:14.166 --> 34:16.250
Hi, honey.

34:16.333 --> 34:20.875
- You look handsome in a tux.
- Jerome, give us the room, please.

34:26.250 --> 34:28.000
All right, look, I know you're mad.

34:28.083 --> 34:30.291
But wait till you hear
what that jerk did to me.

34:30.375 --> 34:32.083
Gabby, shut up.

34:34.333 --> 34:35.792
Are you familiar with the quote,

34:35.875 --> 34:37.333
"For the one to whom
much has been entrusted,

34:37.417 --> 34:40.208
"even more will be demanded"?

34:40.291 --> 34:42.709
Doesn't ring a bell.

34:42.875 --> 34:45.667
- It's from the Bible.
- That explains it.

34:45.750 --> 34:47.875
This is not a joke!

34:47.959 --> 34:52.041
I have been elected mayor.
Certain things are expected of me!

34:52.125 --> 34:55.667
One in particular is that my future wife
not assault city employees!

34:55.750 --> 34:58.917
- He was mean! He deserved it.
- I don't care!

34:59.000 --> 35:00.375
Your behaviour reflects on me.

35:00.458 --> 35:03.792
And I can't do my job
if you're constantly humiliating me.

35:03.875 --> 35:06.792
Constantly? Aside from today,
give me one example.

35:06.875 --> 35:08.667
Okay, how about jumping into my arms
like a 10-year-old

35:08.750 --> 35:09.875
at the election party?

35:12.500 --> 35:15.458
I was just joking around, being me.
I thought you liked that.

35:15.542 --> 35:19.208
I do, in private. In public,
you have to act like a grown-up.

35:27.125 --> 35:33.000
Okay. I'm sorry I disappointed you.
It won't happen again.

35:34.291 --> 35:35.417
I better get dressed.

35:35.500 --> 35:37.917
I don't want to be late
to the victory party.

35:39.250 --> 35:40.917
What happened to your wrist?

35:42.375 --> 35:44.208
That's what I was trying to tell you.

35:44.291 --> 35:46.500
The meter man,
he grabbed my arm and twisted it.

35:46.583 --> 35:48.709
What?

35:49.875 --> 35:52.208
My God, he left a bruise.

35:52.291 --> 35:54.125
It's not as bad as it looks.

35:54.208 --> 35:56.959
Still, he shouldn't have done that.

36:09.625 --> 36:12.667
- Hey.
- Hey.

36:13.667 --> 36:14.834
You're home early.

36:14.917 --> 36:20.583
It was kind of dead tonight. Hi.
Oh, sorry.

36:25.083 --> 36:31.041
By the way, we are gonna need to find
a new chef. Rick gave notice.

36:32.041 --> 36:33.667
He quit?

36:33.750 --> 36:38.917
He got a better offer from some place
across town.

36:40.375 --> 36:41.834
That's too bad.

36:41.917 --> 36:43.625
Well...

36:44.834 --> 36:47.166
Whatcha gonna do?

36:47.208 --> 36:52.917
Well, we don't have to hire someone.
I am coming back.

36:55.041 --> 36:56.291
You sure you're ready?

36:56.375 --> 36:58.917
Yeah, doctor said I can lose
the back brace next week.

36:59.000 --> 37:03.333
And I promise I'll take it easy.
No lifting, just cooking.

37:03.417 --> 37:05.834
Well, okay, then.

37:09.458 --> 37:13.000
I feel really good about this, hon.

37:15.500 --> 37:18.917
I have been going nuts
just lying around.

37:23.667 --> 37:27.208
This is gonna be so great.
We're a team again.

37:29.291 --> 37:32.166
Besides,

37:32.250 --> 37:34.625
I missed you.

37:37.875 --> 37:40.208
I missed you, too.

37:53.000 --> 37:57.083
- Hey, Edie.
- Well, hello, stranger.

37:58.083 --> 38:00.917
Come on in.

38:03.583 --> 38:05.250
So what's up?

38:05.333 --> 38:07.792
Nothing much.

38:11.625 --> 38:13.750
I hear you're going for joint custody
of Travers.

38:13.834 --> 38:18.542
Yep. I hired a lawyer,
and he is a real shark.

38:18.625 --> 38:21.125
You're not messing around.

38:21.208 --> 38:24.500
I think it's important that Travers
has his mother in his life.

38:26.000 --> 38:31.875
Of course, he'll probably want to spend
more time with his video game buddy.

38:33.792 --> 38:39.500
Yeah. You know,
but I just keep thinking,

38:40.583 --> 38:41.750
what's all this gonna be like for him?

38:41.834 --> 38:43.834
You know,
all the travelling back and forth.

38:43.917 --> 38:47.583
He's a kid. He'll adjust.

38:47.667 --> 38:50.709
Two schools, two sets of friends.
I mean, it's not gonna be easy.

38:50.792 --> 38:57.041
Why are you being so negative?
I thought you'd be excited about this.

38:57.125 --> 38:59.875
I know you did.

38:59.959 --> 39:01.959
I just want you to ask yourself,

39:02.041 --> 39:05.458
is this all really in the best interest
of Travers?

39:05.542 --> 39:08.709
You know, kids need stability.

39:10.041 --> 39:12.625
What about what I need?

39:17.333 --> 39:20.959
I know that you miss him.

39:21.041 --> 39:24.208
And I know you're worried
about being lonely,

39:24.291 --> 39:27.333
but I am going to be here for you.

39:28.667 --> 39:31.000
Yeah, once every two weeks.

39:31.083 --> 39:35.667
No, I'm really going to be here for you.

39:38.250 --> 39:40.625
And I'm gonna make you happy.

39:43.375 --> 39:45.000
Don't say that
if you don't mean it, Carlos.

39:45.083 --> 39:46.542
I do.

39:54.458 --> 39:58.208
All right. I'll...

40:00.000 --> 40:02.125
I'll call off the lawyer.

40:16.333 --> 40:19.709
You know, I really am gonna miss him.

40:23.667 --> 40:26.750
Yeah. Me, too.

40:28.709 --> 40:30.250
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

40:30.333 --> 40:34.875
<i>please join me in welcoming</i>
<i>the next mayor of Fairview,</i>

40:34.959 --> 40:37.250
<i>Victor Lang!</i>

41:02.291 --> 41:03.500
Your name Jeff Scott?

41:03.583 --> 41:06.166
- Yeah.
- You read meters for a living?

41:09.125 --> 41:11.333
Do you know how much I love you?

41:16.333 --> 41:18.875
I think so.

41:20.375 --> 41:23.333
<i>Anyone can end up a victim,</i>

41:24.208 --> 41:26.875
<i>injured by the actions of others.</i>

41:28.542 --> 41:33.250

41:34.208 --> 41:38.458

41:52.625 --> 41:54.250

41:56.667 --> 42:00.917
Mike. I twisted my ankle.

42:01.750 --> 42:03.125
Good.

42:06.875 --> 42:08.709
Because now I get to do this.
