WEBVTT

00:09.843 --> 00:11.845
Done. What was my time?

00:11.928 --> 00:13.346
It was very fast.

00:13.847 --> 00:14.889
All right.

00:15.724 --> 00:19.894
It's time to oil
the hinges on the front door, huh?

00:20.478 --> 00:22.772
-Time me.
-And… go!

00:24.357 --> 00:26.860
Yeah, I'm not…
I'm not even using the stopwatch.

00:28.445 --> 00:31.114
He's moving around pretty good
after his little accident.

00:31.197 --> 00:33.408
Oh, you mean
when you ran over him with your bike?

00:33.491 --> 00:35.577
Gosh, are you ever gonna
let me live that down?

00:35.660 --> 00:39.873
It was two days ago.
He still has a tire track on his hip.

00:41.458 --> 00:44.169
Wow, it is rainin'
tits and livers out there.

00:45.086 --> 00:47.172
This rain is never gonna let up.

00:47.255 --> 00:50.216
I was supposed to donate
all our old junk today, but now I can't.

00:50.300 --> 00:52.135
Oh, the church won't mind
if your stuff is wet.

00:52.218 --> 00:54.429
I gave 'em a box of old bras
that were covered in caramel,

00:54.512 --> 00:55.889
and they were thrilled.

00:58.558 --> 01:01.311
Yeah, no. Now that it's raining,
Red won't leave the house,

01:01.394 --> 01:03.438
and he never lets me get rid of anything.

01:03.521 --> 01:08.026
If he paid four dollars
for a can opener in 1975,

01:08.109 --> 01:09.569
he wants to be buried with it.

01:09.652 --> 01:12.322
I had a uncle that was buried
in a Packers helmet,

01:12.405 --> 01:14.616
but that was just because
we couldn't get it off.

01:16.201 --> 01:18.495
-Did you hear the front door open?
-No.

01:18.578 --> 01:19.746
Exactly.

01:19.829 --> 01:25.585
Because we have
the quietest hinges on the block.

01:25.668 --> 01:28.129
And the Kowalskis can suck it!

01:29.130 --> 01:31.341
So… what else is on the fritz?

01:31.424 --> 01:33.218
Red, you should come help me.

01:33.301 --> 01:35.637
The kids have been home all summer
trashin' my house.

01:35.720 --> 01:37.597
I could keep you busy for hours.

01:37.680 --> 01:40.475
Oh, that is a great idea.

01:40.558 --> 01:42.936
Yeah. The other day,
a doorknob fell off in my hand,

01:43.019 --> 01:45.146
and now that's just
a room we don't go in anymore.

01:46.356 --> 01:47.273
Oh shoot.

01:47.774 --> 01:48.817
We had a fish in there.

01:50.026 --> 01:52.862
Red, you love to flush a dead fish.

01:53.530 --> 01:55.198
But he's gonna
have to fix the toilet first.

01:55.281 --> 01:57.117
It makes a sound like this when you flush.

02:00.286 --> 02:01.454
Take me there!

02:02.330 --> 02:03.498
Thank you.

02:06.751 --> 02:10.338
I'm sorry you have to see
this disgusting hickey I got from Jay.

02:11.172 --> 02:13.049
I… I'm so embarrassed.

02:15.176 --> 02:17.679
Leia, there's literally nothing there.

02:17.762 --> 02:19.639
No, no, no. Get up close.

02:19.722 --> 02:22.016
It's… It's <i>so</i> gross.

02:22.517 --> 02:26.146
She wants a big song and dance,
but we are not giving it to her.

02:26.229 --> 02:29.107
I'm still getting used to
you and Jay being an official thing.

02:29.190 --> 02:32.193
It's like when I found out
that dogs got periods.

02:32.277 --> 02:34.404
And I was like, "Huh?"

02:36.156 --> 02:38.366
The fact that you even think
you have a hickey

02:38.449 --> 02:40.451
means that Jay's mouth was on your neck.

02:40.535 --> 02:43.246
-So stuff's happening?
-Stuff's happening.

02:43.913 --> 02:46.082
I got this big guy last night

02:46.166 --> 02:48.751
while we were cuddled up on a beanbag
under a blanket.

02:48.835 --> 02:50.962
Oh, I see.

02:52.088 --> 02:54.424
-So did you touch it?
-Touch what?

02:54.507 --> 02:56.259
You don't ask that if you touched it.

02:56.968 --> 02:58.636
Oh, it?

02:58.720 --> 03:01.181
-Why would you even say that?
-I don't know.

03:01.264 --> 03:04.559
Blanket plus bean bag
usually equals touching it.

03:04.642 --> 03:06.352
It's simple sex math.

03:07.604 --> 03:10.106
I didn't know, um,
things mean other things.

03:10.190 --> 03:12.400
Everything means something, Leia.

03:12.483 --> 03:13.693
Don't start this with her.

03:14.194 --> 03:17.030
Leia, there are no rules to any of this.
Don't let them get in your head.

03:17.113 --> 03:18.406
Thank you, Gwen.

03:18.489 --> 03:20.909
Just to be clear, I'm not gonna touch it.

03:22.076 --> 03:24.871
-D'you think he thinks I'm gonna touch it?
-Touch what?

03:25.496 --> 03:28.041
The sky! With our… dreams.

03:31.794 --> 03:33.296
This is why I hate rain.

03:35.173 --> 03:36.174
Just close it.

03:36.257 --> 03:37.217
Oh.

03:41.512 --> 03:42.472
Good call, babe.

03:43.097 --> 03:45.016
-<i>One, two, three, four!</i>

03:56.653 --> 03:58.696
<i>Hello, Wisconsin!</i>

03:58.780 --> 04:01.699
Now you've got me thinking about
everything I've done with Jay.

04:01.783 --> 04:04.702
Like, the other night, we shared
a pudding cup. What does that mean?

04:04.786 --> 04:06.871
-Wait, one spoon or two?
-One.

04:06.955 --> 04:08.039
You might be pregnant.

04:10.875 --> 04:13.461
Ah. Who wants to try some fancy candy?

04:13.544 --> 04:16.422
My dad sent me
a whole box of cool stuff from Japan.

04:16.506 --> 04:19.425
He plays baseball over there.
Kind of a big deal.

04:20.051 --> 04:22.011
He's the oldest player in the league.

04:22.095 --> 04:24.555
He does adult diaper commercials
over there.

04:25.848 --> 04:27.600
I don't get why that's not cool.

04:28.101 --> 04:29.102
Don't mind me, kids.

04:29.185 --> 04:31.771
I'm just gonna grab
some of Red's junk from the back.

04:31.854 --> 04:33.564
I was never here.

04:34.649 --> 04:36.067
That's where we keep the stash.

04:36.150 --> 04:38.695
It's cool. Last time I hid it in this.

04:41.114 --> 04:44.492
No one's gonna look in here
'cause they don't have a dog anymore.

04:44.575 --> 04:48.162
Oh, oh. This has to go.
We don't have a dog anymore.

04:50.581 --> 04:52.041
Granny has the stash!

04:53.501 --> 04:56.462
-Why did you just give it to her?
-What was I supposed to do, Gwen?

04:56.546 --> 04:57.964
Not give it to her!

04:58.589 --> 04:59.674
Hang on, hang on.

05:00.425 --> 05:02.176
I've always got your back, bro.

05:02.677 --> 05:04.137
But not now. That was terrible.

05:05.221 --> 05:06.973
Look, it's not a problem.

05:07.807 --> 05:09.100
I'll just go get it.

05:13.771 --> 05:16.316
Mrs. Forman, you have
a lot of identical boxes.

05:17.692 --> 05:21.612
Oh, this isn't even the half of it.
You should see the garage.

05:26.451 --> 05:27.952
We have a big problem.

05:28.453 --> 05:30.330
Which requires a big solution.

05:30.413 --> 05:31.664
Does anybody have one?

05:32.707 --> 05:34.459
We need to split up and look for it.

05:34.542 --> 05:36.878
Nikki and I will take upstairs.

05:39.672 --> 05:42.633
No, if you two are alone,
you're just gonna find some dark corner

05:42.717 --> 05:44.010
to hump all over each other.

05:44.844 --> 05:46.512
Fine, Jay and I can go together.

05:46.596 --> 05:48.890
If you guys are together,
you'll just talk about

05:48.973 --> 05:52.352
your favorite sex scenes
in Jean-Claude Van Damme movies.

05:52.935 --> 05:54.270
<i>-Lionheart.</i>
-<i>Bloodsport</i>.

05:54.937 --> 05:56.481
<i>Hard Target!</i>

05:59.442 --> 06:00.818
Nate and I will go upstairs.

06:00.902 --> 06:03.529
Ozzie, you and Jay
go through the boxes in the garage.

06:03.613 --> 06:06.407
-Yeah, Leia and I will look down here.
-But we know it's not down here.

06:06.491 --> 06:07.909
Then I guess we're done.

06:08.493 --> 06:11.954
Don't worry, Leia.
I'm the right man for this job.

06:17.543 --> 06:19.045
What the hell was that?

06:19.837 --> 06:21.506
What? I kissed my boyfriend.

06:21.589 --> 06:23.591
No. What were you doing with your arms?

06:23.674 --> 06:26.469
They were sticking out behind you
like a ski jumper.

06:26.552 --> 06:31.015
You got in my head, and now I don't know
what means what or… where to touch him.

06:31.099 --> 06:33.601
Whatever. We have way bigger things
to worry about now.

06:33.684 --> 06:34.894
I don't think we do!

06:37.146 --> 06:38.564
Do you know what we should do?

06:38.648 --> 06:42.276
We should go to the cops and ask to borrow
one of those drug-sniffing dogs.

06:42.360 --> 06:43.861
How are we even related?

06:44.362 --> 06:46.489
We have the same mom.

06:46.572 --> 06:47.990
Why do you always ask me that?

06:49.575 --> 06:50.451
Aww!

06:50.535 --> 06:52.787
You kids came up here to help me.

06:52.870 --> 06:54.414
You are so sweet.

06:54.497 --> 06:57.458
And you, I really need
your muscles right now.

06:57.542 --> 06:59.627
Mrs. Forman, I…

07:00.128 --> 07:01.462
I have a girlfriend.

07:02.171 --> 07:03.423
Oh please.

07:04.590 --> 07:07.009
You wouldn't know what to do with this.

07:08.386 --> 07:12.849
No. Red has a giant wooden moose
in the upstairs closet.

07:12.932 --> 07:15.101
And I've been trying
to get rid of it for years,

07:15.184 --> 07:17.145
but it's too heavy for me to lift.

07:17.228 --> 07:19.730
Oh sure. Don't ask me
because you need a man to help.

07:19.814 --> 07:21.649
Oh, calm down, Eleanor Roosevelt.

07:21.732 --> 07:24.735
I just want the stupid thing
out of the house.

07:24.819 --> 07:25.820
Okay.

07:25.903 --> 07:28.698
Go get the moose,
and I'll keep helping down here.

07:28.781 --> 07:29.782
On it.

07:30.533 --> 07:33.661
Can you describe this wooden moose to me?

07:34.454 --> 07:35.538
It's a moose.

07:39.041 --> 07:40.585
But made of wood.

07:42.253 --> 07:43.296
I'll do my best.

07:46.883 --> 07:48.426
This sucks.

07:48.509 --> 07:51.137
Yesterday I was totally comfortable
kissing Jay.

07:51.220 --> 07:54.557
Now you look like a baby
that doesn't want to get picked up.

07:54.640 --> 07:55.600
I know what I did!

07:57.268 --> 07:59.645
Oh, I'm sorry. I feel bad.

08:00.563 --> 08:03.774
I was trying to give you advice,
not break your brain.

08:04.692 --> 08:05.860
I need advice.

08:05.943 --> 08:08.446
Jay has a lot of experience.

08:08.529 --> 08:10.156
The closest I've come to having sex

08:10.239 --> 08:12.533
is when I got a front wedgie
on a Slip 'N Slide.

08:13.242 --> 08:14.744
Yeah. You gotta go headfirst.

08:14.827 --> 08:15.828
I did.

08:16.454 --> 08:18.456
My friend's mom is a mechanical engineer.

08:18.539 --> 08:19.999
She was baffled.

08:20.583 --> 08:22.043
Look, don't overthink it.

08:22.126 --> 08:25.004
Just do what comes naturally.
Except don't touch his hair.

08:25.087 --> 08:27.673
If I go near Nate's hair,
it flips a switch in his pants.

08:28.341 --> 08:29.425
There's a switch?

08:29.926 --> 08:31.802
These boys are so complicated!

08:31.886 --> 08:33.221
They're really not.

08:33.930 --> 08:36.265
Just put your hands on his hips.

08:36.349 --> 08:39.185
It's close enough to the good stuff
so he knows that you're interested,

08:39.268 --> 08:41.854
but far enough away
so he knows you're not making a move.

08:42.605 --> 08:43.648
Got it.

08:43.731 --> 08:46.234
Lips are for hips
like zippers are for zips.

08:47.735 --> 08:49.278
It's how I learned my state capitals.

08:49.987 --> 08:51.447
Never do that again.

08:53.407 --> 08:54.825
-Jackpot.
-You found it?

08:55.618 --> 08:58.538
No, I found a whole box
of old Halloween costumes.

08:59.372 --> 09:01.207
I think this is supposed to be a bee.

09:01.832 --> 09:04.460
Oh, Mrs. Forman, bless your heart.
You tried.

09:04.961 --> 09:07.755
Ozzie, stop messing around.
We're not playing dress-up.

09:07.838 --> 09:09.966
Then take off that old jacket you found.

09:10.049 --> 09:12.468
Come on. Makes me look
like Christian Slater.

09:13.261 --> 09:15.429
We must be thinking of
different Christian Slaters.

09:17.682 --> 09:18.766
Oh look!

09:19.559 --> 09:21.727
Oh! Sweet. You found it.

09:24.188 --> 09:28.484
You have had quite the adventure today,
little baggie. Let's get you home.

09:30.278 --> 09:32.905
-What are you doing in my garage?
-Uh…

09:32.989 --> 09:34.574
We were… waiting for you.

09:34.657 --> 09:35.741
You're late.

09:36.617 --> 09:38.494
Tell us about your day, Mr. Forman.

09:40.204 --> 09:42.832
All right, this is when you leave.

09:44.458 --> 09:46.085
And give me that jacket.

09:46.168 --> 09:51.299
I paid full price for that thing
at Sears in 1964.

09:57.471 --> 09:58.973
Get out of my garage.

09:59.056 --> 10:00.600
You're basement people!

10:06.480 --> 10:09.483
-Is this it?
-No, it's the other one.

10:09.567 --> 10:10.943
Oh, my bad.

10:11.027 --> 10:12.486
No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

10:13.863 --> 10:15.531
You can't do that with him.

10:16.115 --> 10:18.075
-That is big.
-And heavy.

10:18.159 --> 10:19.410
And stupid.

10:23.914 --> 10:26.250
Wait… That's the shirt my dad sent me.

10:26.334 --> 10:28.461
You got stuff all over it and cut it up.

10:28.544 --> 10:30.713
It's too small for you, anyway.
Just like our shower.

10:30.796 --> 10:33.507
I hear you banging around in there
like a bear that fell in a dumpster.

10:34.300 --> 10:36.260
I take an athletic shower.

10:36.761 --> 10:39.680
And don't try to change the subject.
You can't just touch my stuff.

10:39.764 --> 10:41.807
You mean like this? And this? And this?

10:41.891 --> 10:45.728
-Quit it, Gwen!
-Okay, I understand why you're fighting.

10:45.811 --> 10:47.772
He… He <i>does</i> this to people.

10:47.855 --> 10:50.274
Let's just get him out!

10:50.358 --> 10:51.651
Get him out!

10:55.780 --> 10:57.698
-You're gonna pay.
-You're being an idiot.

10:57.782 --> 10:59.116
Your face is being an idiot.

10:59.200 --> 11:02.495
-That doesn't even make sense.
-Yeah. It doesn't.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.794
Red… has the stash.

11:09.877 --> 11:13.047
Cool, cool. Yeah. Um, hang on one second.

11:19.595 --> 11:20.763
So what do we do now?

11:21.430 --> 11:22.431
It's okay.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.558
He doesn't even know he has it yet.

11:25.101 --> 11:25.935
Right, Ozzie?

11:26.435 --> 11:27.395
Has what?

11:27.895 --> 11:31.816
I'm just a sweet innocent kid who got
caught up with some no-good riffraff.

11:32.817 --> 11:34.777
You save-yourself son of a bitch.

11:36.362 --> 11:37.488
I respect that.

11:39.323 --> 11:41.367
-Now, go get it.
-We will.

11:41.450 --> 11:46.038
I just… wanted to come say goodbye to Leia
in case I never saw her again.

11:46.622 --> 11:48.124
Aww.

11:48.791 --> 11:50.084
Are we doing this?

12:02.346 --> 12:03.514
Uh…

12:04.598 --> 12:05.683
Mm-hmm…

12:05.766 --> 12:08.352
Leia… move your hands.

12:10.771 --> 12:12.231
And we're back to that.

12:13.941 --> 12:16.569
Hi, Sherri. Listen.
I'm gonna need more time.

12:16.652 --> 12:19.363
I don't know how much more I can stall.
He's done everything.

12:19.447 --> 12:21.657
I think my hinges are quieter than yours.

12:21.741 --> 12:24.201
Well… I doubt that.

12:25.536 --> 12:28.164
Just… Just make something up. Bye.

12:32.334 --> 12:33.335
What?

12:33.419 --> 12:36.797
I think I just saw a mouse.
It was big. It looked half-rat!

12:36.881 --> 12:39.550
Well, it's about to be all dead.

12:43.012 --> 12:44.847
Well, there's my big, strong boy.

12:44.930 --> 12:47.725
Again… I'm spoken for.

12:49.018 --> 12:50.019
Oh.

12:50.686 --> 12:51.687
What a shame.

12:54.440 --> 12:57.485
-Look what I took from under your pillow.
-What are you doing with that?

12:57.985 --> 13:00.154
She looks all tough,
but she can't fall asleep

13:00.237 --> 13:01.530
without Frankie the Blankie.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.407
He needs me too.

13:04.283 --> 13:07.536
You touch my stuff,
Frankie gets butt-flossed.

13:08.037 --> 13:09.955
-Frankie!
-Hey.

13:11.916 --> 13:13.209
-Get off!
-No!

13:14.376 --> 13:16.170
Fine. Then I'm going to the bathroom.

13:16.253 --> 13:18.339
-Eww! I hate you!
-I hate you!

13:19.757 --> 13:21.175
I hate you!

13:27.139 --> 13:29.725
There it is.
Let's grab it and get out of here.

13:29.809 --> 13:33.229
Wait! This feels too easy.
What if it's a trap?

13:35.022 --> 13:36.148
You've seen too many car--

13:36.232 --> 13:37.858
-It's a trap!

13:37.942 --> 13:40.152
I knew it!

13:43.155 --> 13:44.114
Freeze!

13:46.826 --> 13:47.910
-Damn it!

13:47.993 --> 13:49.036
Ow!

13:50.287 --> 13:51.747
This place is hell!

13:53.165 --> 13:55.584
This is almost as bad as
the Slip 'N Slide incident.

13:55.668 --> 13:57.586
My neighbor Connie had to coach me through

13:58.087 --> 13:59.129
getting it out.

13:59.797 --> 14:02.341
Wow. My neighbors don't even wave hello.

14:02.967 --> 14:05.177
I hate how weird everything is.

14:05.261 --> 14:08.138
I wish I could just fast-forward
to where you and Nate are.

14:08.222 --> 14:09.974
Where, like, things are easy.

14:10.057 --> 14:12.226
Believe me, it's not always easy.

14:13.644 --> 14:16.438
Nate and I aren't really
on the same page about our futures.

14:16.522 --> 14:20.317
Now, we're having
the dumbest fights about everything.

14:20.818 --> 14:22.695
Like what to do if there's a tornado.

14:22.778 --> 14:24.780
I say hide in a basement.

14:25.739 --> 14:26.657
He wants to ride one.

14:27.658 --> 14:31.036
I'm just saying,
things are never going to be perfect.

14:31.954 --> 14:35.666
And as for what happened with Jay,
sure, it was bad.

14:36.166 --> 14:38.210
But it's not gonna be
as bad as when we tell everyone.

14:38.294 --> 14:39.545
Thanks.

14:40.379 --> 14:42.089
-We got it.
-You did?

14:42.756 --> 14:44.258
Might have cost me a toe.

14:44.800 --> 14:46.969
I'm afraid to look, but my sock feels wet.

14:48.596 --> 14:50.681
Hey, so, about earlier.

14:50.764 --> 14:53.517
What? I don't even know
what you're talking about.

14:54.101 --> 14:56.687
Uh, that's <i>all</i> he talked about.

14:58.314 --> 15:01.692
I just got in my head about us,
and I'm worried I made things weird.

15:01.775 --> 15:04.862
Can we just forget about it
and go back to the way it was?

15:04.945 --> 15:06.655
Like when you gave me this huge hickey?

15:07.656 --> 15:10.034
-Where is it again?
-The point is…

15:11.035 --> 15:13.120
I just want things to be
fun and comfortable again.

15:13.871 --> 15:15.998
Well… I want what you want.

15:16.582 --> 15:18.584
Good, because this is what I want.

15:19.668 --> 15:20.586
Ew, your toe!

15:20.669 --> 15:21.795
Ooh, I wanna see.

15:23.756 --> 15:24.840
You kissed my ear.

15:24.924 --> 15:26.175
Stop turning!

15:30.095 --> 15:31.597
Stop breathing on me.

15:33.807 --> 15:36.018
-Okay, that's enough.

15:36.936 --> 15:39.021
What's your problem? Come on. Chop-chop.

15:39.104 --> 15:40.105
Fine.

15:41.732 --> 15:44.944
That wasn't just any shirt.
It's from my dad.

15:45.027 --> 15:47.154
-But it didn't even fit you.
-It doesn't matter.

15:47.237 --> 15:50.366
He went out and bought it
and… and put it in the box.

15:50.449 --> 15:53.118
His hands were on it.

15:53.202 --> 15:56.163
You wouldn't understand.
You see your dad way more than I do.

15:56.246 --> 15:58.082
Yeah, but I still miss him.

15:58.165 --> 16:01.418
I only ever get to see him when he comes
through town on his way to another city.

16:01.502 --> 16:03.170
Circus performer?

16:04.964 --> 16:06.382
How is <i>that</i> your first guess?

16:08.300 --> 16:09.551
He's a truck driver.

16:10.928 --> 16:14.348
But, Nate, if I'd known how you felt,
I never would have touched it.

16:14.431 --> 16:15.432
Or cut it up.

16:16.141 --> 16:18.644
Or let cars run over it
to make it look vintage.

16:20.020 --> 16:21.438
It's fine. It's dumb.

16:21.939 --> 16:23.107
No, it's not dumb.

16:23.190 --> 16:24.525
It sucks for both of us.

16:25.985 --> 16:28.070
You idiot. You made me cry.

16:29.738 --> 16:31.573
-I hate you.
-I hate you too.

16:33.575 --> 16:34.952
I miss my dad too.

16:36.829 --> 16:40.082
He took me to the dog track
on my tenth birthday.

16:40.582 --> 16:42.626
And he gave me a sip of his beer,

16:42.710 --> 16:45.462
and I barfed up my popcorn,

16:45.546 --> 16:48.048
and it still looked like popcorn.

16:51.510 --> 16:53.762
Red's coming! He's right behind me!

16:54.847 --> 16:57.266
He's got that cane,
so maybe we've got some time.

16:58.183 --> 16:59.727
Nate, moose, now.

16:59.810 --> 17:00.769
Let me help you.

17:00.853 --> 17:03.105
-Thanks, sis.
-I got you, big bro.

17:03.689 --> 17:06.150
Why are my kids being nice?
Did they get into your wine?

17:06.734 --> 17:09.403
No. We… We had an emotional moment.

17:09.903 --> 17:11.697
They both were missing their dads.

17:11.780 --> 17:12.740
Oh.

17:12.823 --> 17:15.159
Man, that's always a gut punch.

17:15.242 --> 17:17.036
No. It wasn't the end of the world.

17:17.119 --> 17:20.998
No, no. Nate's father sent him a T-shirt.
It was too small.

17:21.081 --> 17:22.833
Gwen took it. It's okay now.

17:22.916 --> 17:24.293
Frickin' Brian.

17:26.086 --> 17:29.006
I try to do whatever I can
to make sure my kids never feel bad,

17:29.089 --> 17:31.216
but sometimes things
slip through my cracks.

17:34.845 --> 17:36.972
That's… That's a lot of numbers.

17:39.683 --> 17:40.893
Brian, it's me.

17:41.769 --> 17:43.854
What the hell do I care
what time it is in Japan?

17:43.937 --> 17:45.647
I'm in Wisconsin.

17:46.231 --> 17:48.734
Yeah, I…

17:52.237 --> 17:55.032
You need to send your son
a shirt that actually fits.

17:55.115 --> 17:57.117
He's as tall as your sister now.

17:57.201 --> 17:59.495
And tell that broad in your bed
to close her mouth.

17:59.578 --> 18:01.080
I can hear her snorin'!

18:01.705 --> 18:03.082
She's on the phone with Japan.

18:03.165 --> 18:04.458
Japan?

18:04.958 --> 18:05.918
Sayonara.

18:09.880 --> 18:12.382
Now, <i>this</i> is you spend a dainy ray.

18:13.550 --> 18:14.551
Rainy dray.

18:16.095 --> 18:17.096
Day.

18:18.430 --> 18:20.099
Hey, be careful.

18:20.182 --> 18:22.476
It's bad luck to open a brella inside.

18:24.144 --> 18:25.145
Hold up.

18:26.021 --> 18:27.231
Say that word again.

18:28.023 --> 18:28.941
Brella.

18:29.024 --> 18:31.860
Like, when it's raining, and Mom can
never remember what they're called,

18:31.944 --> 18:35.989
and she's always like,
"Take your, um… brella."

18:38.033 --> 18:39.201
No way!

18:44.498 --> 18:45.374
Brella.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.131
Wait, is he hot?

18:53.215 --> 18:54.508
Uh…

18:54.591 --> 18:55.509
Yeah.

18:59.847 --> 19:01.431
Hey, it stopped raining.

19:02.766 --> 19:05.352
She's right. Let's get outta here.

19:49.021 --> 19:51.023
Do you guys remember coming out here?

19:51.773 --> 19:52.608
No.

19:53.108 --> 19:56.653
But I'm glad we did.
It ended up being a pretty solid day.

19:58.989 --> 20:00.449
I hope this never ends.

20:00.532 --> 20:02.659
Kids, your school schedules came!

20:02.743 --> 20:04.661
Summer is finally over.

20:04.745 --> 20:06.580
All this is gonna end.
