00:17.472 --> 00:19.030
A maverick billionaire...

00:19.033 --> 00:20.971
My name is Gideon Reeves.

00:20.972 --> 00:24.704
I built an empire making
rockets, computers, robots...

00:24.705 --> 00:27.776
Made over $100 billion.
Know how I did it?

00:27.779 --> 00:29.531
I'm an engineer.

00:29.534 --> 00:31.171
...touched by tragedy...

00:31.174 --> 00:33.373
- The money!
- No!

00:33.376 --> 00:35.205
My friend has been shot.

00:35.206 --> 00:37.138
Where the hell are you people?!

00:37.139 --> 00:39.804
...takes on the
biggest engineering challenge

00:39.805 --> 00:40.693
of his career...

00:40.696 --> 00:42.471
I want justice for Elliot James Sully.

00:42.472 --> 00:44.912
Give me the 13th district to run.

00:44.915 --> 00:47.838
A civilian can't take
over a police district.

00:47.839 --> 00:50.307
They can, with a special
appointment from this committee.

00:50.310 --> 00:52.615
...to
revolutionize a police force...

00:52.618 --> 00:54.982
Technology doesn't solve cases, cops do.

00:54.985 --> 00:56.558
You haven't met my technology.

01:03.207 --> 01:05.462
You guys are my partners.

We're gonna change the world.

01:09.740 --> 01:12.606
On behalf of Reeves Industries,

01:12.607 --> 01:16.124
welcome to the nerdgasm
event of the year,

01:16.127 --> 01:19.700
the Silicon Super Bowl
for the pasty and clever,

01:19.703 --> 01:22.372
the Windy City Tech Summit!

01:25.406 --> 01:27.572
Holograms! Right?

01:27.573 --> 01:29.339
Who here loves a good hologram?

01:31.907 --> 01:34.572
Ah, yes, that's what I thought.

01:34.573 --> 01:38.405
So, as chief sponsor
of today's festivities,

01:38.406 --> 01:42.206
that amazing-ness is
what Reeves is all about.

01:42.207 --> 01:43.672
Making you see things in a new way,

01:43.673 --> 01:45.073
changing the world,

01:45.074 --> 01:48.906
one awesome, mind-blowing
demonstration at a time!

01:52.074 --> 01:53.572
Yes. All right.

01:53.573 --> 01:54.672
Well, that's enough of me,

01:54.673 --> 01:56.372
at least until my keynote speech later,

01:56.373 --> 01:58.772
which is gonna be great,
that I can tell you.

01:58.773 --> 02:00.838
So, without further ado...

02:02.042 --> 02:04.239
You know what? Actually, I
want to say one more thing.

02:04.240 --> 02:06.606
So, there have been some
reports in the press lately

02:06.607 --> 02:09.173
that have been less than
kind to me and my company.

02:09.174 --> 02:13.906
One described me as a "flailing
CEO with cop fantasies."

02:13.907 --> 02:16.073
I just want to say to
all the haters out there,

02:16.074 --> 02:19.439
this company is stronger than ever.

02:19.440 --> 02:20.906
Just to prove it,

02:20.907 --> 02:24.339
I want to bring up my
chairman of the board.

02:24.340 --> 02:26.239
Uh-oh. Oh, she doesn't
want to come up. Everybody,

02:26.240 --> 02:28.073
could you just give her a
little bit of love, please?

02:31.160 --> 02:32.199
Yes.

02:32.940 --> 02:35.039
She has been a wonderful,

02:35.040 --> 02:40.606
wonderful friend since my MIT
days, and a tireless supporter

02:40.607 --> 02:41.906
of Reeves Industries...

02:41.907 --> 02:44.772
The brilliant and beautiful...

02:44.773 --> 02:47.039
- You smart-ass son of a...
- ...Lauren Fitch,

02:47.040 --> 02:49.294

03:07.773 --> 03:09.606
Yeah, nice try, Gideon.

03:09.607 --> 03:12.672
What? I was just introducing
you to the convention.

03:12.673 --> 03:14.439
Are you not my good friend? Hi.

03:14.440 --> 03:16.572
Uh, are you not the
chairman of my board?

03:16.573 --> 03:18.039
The chairwoman of... chair human...

03:18.040 --> 03:21.006
Whatever you are, you're
very good at what you do.

03:21.007 --> 03:23.239
If you think kissing my ass
in public is gonna make up

03:23.240 --> 03:26.133
for your falling revenue,
you are sorely mistaken.

03:26.136 --> 03:28.268
Hmm? What? Sorry.

03:28.269 --> 03:30.201
I got distracted when
you mentioned your ass.

03:30.204 --> 03:32.037
All right, and flirting's
not gonna work either.

03:32.039 --> 03:34.801
You are bleeding money with
this new little cop hobby.

03:34.802 --> 03:36.968
Please. Relax.

03:36.969 --> 03:40.737
We've done this dog and
pony show so many times,

03:40.769 --> 03:42.102
we could wear a leash

03:42.103 --> 03:44.668
and a saddle, which you
would look great in, actually.

03:44.669 --> 03:46.068
- Stop.
- For next time.

03:46.069 --> 03:47.335
Stop it.

03:47.336 --> 03:48.435
This one is different.

03:48.436 --> 03:50.168
- Yeah.
- Hey.

03:50.169 --> 03:52.002
Wait. Gideon, don't
you want to go inside?

03:52.003 --> 03:54.002
What? In there? No.
God, no. I'll be mobbed.

03:54.003 --> 03:56.302
Autographs, unsolicited pitches...

03:56.303 --> 03:57.774
All right, well, you should be happy

03:57.777 --> 03:59.469
that they still want
you to kiss their babies.

03:59.470 --> 04:01.768
They might not love you for much longer.

04:01.769 --> 04:03.635
What? Come on. What's not to love?

04:03.636 --> 04:05.335
Gideon, trust me when I tell you,

04:05.336 --> 04:07.469
if this convention doesn't
go off without a hitch,

04:07.470 --> 04:09.135
this very well could be our last.

04:09.136 --> 04:11.901
This is the first time in your
career where you've dug

04:11.902 --> 04:14.168
yourself into a hole, and I
don't know if I can dig you out.

04:14.169 --> 04:15.635
If you don't stop
checking those crime stats,

04:15.636 --> 04:17.334
I'm gonna shove that phone
so far down your throat,

04:17.336 --> 04:18.469
there's gonna be a new crime

04:18.470 --> 04:19.767
for your little friends to investigate.

04:19.769 --> 04:22.668
Oh, all right. God,
murderous rage is...

04:22.669 --> 04:24.569
It's very attractive on you.

04:24.570 --> 04:26.935
- Come on.
- I'm gonna kill you.

04:26.936 --> 04:28.569
While Mr. Reeves is
attending this conference,

04:28.570 --> 04:29.768
we're gonna be running things

04:29.769 --> 04:31.435
a little more rough
and ready around here.

04:31.436 --> 04:33.289
Not to worry.

04:33.292 --> 04:34.835
We'll still have the basics,

04:34.836 --> 04:36.235
but nobody's gonna be inventing

04:36.236 --> 04:38.502
any new robots, at least
not until he gets back.

04:38.503 --> 04:39.951
So,

04:39.954 --> 04:42.169
eyes and ears open. Let's get out there.

04:45.537 --> 04:46.636
Murphy?

04:46.637 --> 04:48.703
Need to talk to you for a minute.

04:48.704 --> 04:51.303
You should head down
to 77th and Freemont.

04:51.304 --> 04:53.270
- What is it?
- Homicide.

04:53.271 --> 04:56.103
Twentysomething found his roommate dead.

04:56.104 --> 04:58.258
Apparently, the victim
was meeting with someone

04:58.261 --> 04:59.536
about an online sale.

04:59.537 --> 05:00.636
Is that all we got?

05:00.639 --> 05:02.038
That and his laptop.

05:02.041 --> 05:04.468
Great. What am I supposed
to do with a laptop?

05:04.471 --> 05:06.036
I mean, without Gideon here,

05:06.037 --> 05:08.370
the only technical support
I have is police I.T.,

05:08.371 --> 05:10.136
and they still use fax machines.

05:10.137 --> 05:13.670
Well, maybe you should take her.

05:15.704 --> 05:18.103
Ada? To a crime scene?

05:18.104 --> 05:19.503
Unless you got a better idea.

05:19.504 --> 05:21.337
She is the computer
girl around here. Ada?

05:21.338 --> 05:23.270
Mm.

05:23.271 --> 05:24.936
You're going out on
a murder with Murphy.

05:24.937 --> 05:26.704
What? Why me?

05:27.704 --> 05:29.470
I'm not even a cop.

05:29.471 --> 05:31.936
I don't look like a cop,
I don't act like a cop,

05:31.937 --> 05:34.303
I especially don't dress like a cop.

05:34.304 --> 05:35.870
Don't worry. Just follow my lead.

05:35.871 --> 05:37.437
So what am I supposed to do?

05:37.438 --> 05:38.870
It's gonna be fine. Just watch.

05:38.871 --> 05:40.703
I'll let you know if we need anything.

05:40.704 --> 05:42.636
Oh, try not to yak.

05:42.637 --> 05:45.636
It's a first-time murder scene thing.

05:45.637 --> 05:47.704
Yeah.

05:57.604 --> 05:58.769
Okay.

05:58.770 --> 06:01.036
So you discovered Josh's body

06:01.037 --> 06:03.303
- when you got home?
- Yeah. I just got the new

06:03.304 --> 06:05.003
Total Combat, was psyched to play it,

06:05.004 --> 06:06.870
and then I found him,

06:06.871 --> 06:08.303
you know,

06:08.304 --> 06:09.669
out of lives.

06:09.670 --> 06:12.958
Okay, um, he was meeting
someone from the Internet?

06:12.961 --> 06:14.603
- Do you know who?
- Sorry, I don't.

06:14.604 --> 06:17.944
All right, just wait outside.
We'll finish your statement later.

06:17.947 --> 06:19.769
Did you get anything?

06:19.770 --> 06:23.103
No, it is password-protected,
so it's gonna take a while.

06:23.104 --> 06:24.803
You can do something,
right? Like, hack it?

06:24.804 --> 06:26.603
Oh, I mean, I could
try a brute force attack

06:26.604 --> 06:28.103
or a cryptography approach.

06:28.104 --> 06:31.036
The password's Mookie22, capital "M."

06:31.037 --> 06:34.870
That'll work.

06:40.171 --> 06:41.703
You seem annoyingly cheerful.

06:41.704 --> 06:43.603
Sorry.

06:43.604 --> 06:46.103
You know, Gideon's at his
little conference thing,

06:46.104 --> 06:47.870
and, you know, it just feels good

06:47.871 --> 06:49.636
to be back to basics, you know?

06:49.637 --> 06:53.003
Yeah, just when you were
warming up to the new toys.

06:53.004 --> 06:55.036
Some of 'em. But the drone, though?

06:55.037 --> 06:57.603
Uh-uh, no. Thing freaks me out.

06:57.604 --> 07:00.437
You know, it's always there,
watching, hovering above us.

07:00.438 --> 07:02.603
I'm always afraid it's
gonna take my head off.

07:02.604 --> 07:05.936
Man, yesterday we wrestled
two drunk dudes with knives.

07:05.937 --> 07:07.636
You seriously worried about a drone?

07:07.637 --> 07:10.337
The robots always turn
on the humans eventually.

07:10.338 --> 07:13.147
Terminator, Westworld.

07:13.150 --> 07:14.848
It's just a matter of time.

07:16.438 --> 07:17.704
What is it?

07:21.271 --> 07:23.003
Possible suicide.

07:23.004 --> 07:25.303
I hate suicide calls.
Roll it to a beat car.

07:25.304 --> 07:26.936
We're in a beat car.

07:26.937 --> 07:28.590
And besides, you can't stand it

07:28.593 --> 07:30.731
when other cops try to
put their crap on us.

07:30.734 --> 07:33.203
I'm just saying that
suicide calls are the worst.

07:33.204 --> 07:35.769
It's just... it's depressing as hell.

07:35.770 --> 07:38.769
Call came from a 19-year-old
student at Rockwell. Yeah.

07:38.770 --> 07:40.871
Address is a dorm.

07:42.937 --> 07:44.536
We're not punting this.

07:47.927 --> 07:48.836
I haven't seen
Evan since yesterday.

07:49.520 --> 07:50.437
What's going on?

07:50.438 --> 07:52.203
We just need to check his room.

07:52.204 --> 07:54.371
Yeah.

07:55.659 --> 07:57.445
Evan Finley, Chicago Police.

07:57.448 --> 07:58.703
You in there?

07:58.704 --> 08:00.669
Open up!

08:00.670 --> 08:02.204
Open it.

08:07.756 --> 08:08.234
Okay.

08:08.235 --> 08:09.967
Good. It's nothing.

08:09.968 --> 08:12.534
We dodged a bullet. Maybe he did, too.

08:12.535 --> 08:13.767
You don't know that.

08:13.768 --> 08:15.200
Well, hopefully,

08:15.201 --> 08:17.367
he changed his mind and
went and got some pizza.

08:17.368 --> 08:20.702
Speaking of, um, let's go
get some lunch or something.

08:24.702 --> 08:26.868
We're not done here.

08:34.914 --> 08:36.062
How much longer is this gonna take?

08:36.065 --> 08:37.866
Uh, maybe a bit because

08:37.868 --> 08:39.634
there's not an icon I can click on

08:39.635 --> 08:41.299
that just says "murder motive."

08:41.301 --> 08:43.567
I don't know how you spend your
life glued to a computer screen.

08:43.568 --> 08:44.800
I mean, I'd go crazy.

08:44.801 --> 08:47.634
Yeah, well, beats staring
at a severed trachea.

08:47.635 --> 08:50.267
Uh, I got something.

08:50.268 --> 08:51.267
What?

08:51.268 --> 08:52.534
Looks like an e-mail exchange

08:52.535 --> 08:54.900
between the victim and
the guy he was selling to.

08:54.901 --> 08:55.900
What were they selling?

08:55.901 --> 08:57.400
Trying to figure that out.

08:57.401 --> 09:01.534
Uh, looks like... the
cost was two grand, cash.

09:01.535 --> 09:03.567
They set up a meeting place yesterday.

09:03.568 --> 09:04.567
Blah, blah.

09:04.568 --> 09:06.067
Oh, no.

09:06.068 --> 09:09.534
Ada, what?

09:09.535 --> 09:11.067
They were selling

09:11.068 --> 09:13.468
an all-access wristband
to Gideon's convention.

09:19.435 --> 09:20.800
Nice meeting you.

09:20.801 --> 09:23.800
We here at MilliScan
are excited to announce

09:23.801 --> 09:28.400
that we've made millimeter
wave scanning 70% smaller.

09:28.401 --> 09:30.300
Our small, easy-to-use
millimeter wave scanners...

09:30.301 --> 09:31.634
I'm here to win.

09:31.635 --> 09:32.900
And you liked it?

09:32.901 --> 09:33.900
I loved it.

09:33.901 --> 09:35.767
Yeah, you got really into it?

09:35.768 --> 09:36.800
I'm bored.

09:36.801 --> 09:37.900
Shut up.

09:37.901 --> 09:42.567
I'm looking at boring
people with gray boxes.

09:42.568 --> 09:43.800
With MilliScan...

09:43.801 --> 09:45.967
Do you know what their market
cap is, their valuation?

09:45.968 --> 09:47.567
I can't hear you. I'm asleep.

09:47.568 --> 09:49.067
No more being herded like cattle.

09:49.068 --> 09:51.434
No need to arrive two
hours prior to your flight.

09:51.435 --> 09:53.534
There is a lot of money in airports.

09:53.537 --> 09:56.744
There is a lot of foot
odor at security checks.

09:56.747 --> 09:57.567
Gideon.

09:57.568 --> 10:00.434
What? I launch spaceships.

10:00.435 --> 10:01.567
You know what they say.

10:01.568 --> 10:03.434
Once you pass the
mesosphere, you never...

10:03.435 --> 10:05.367
All right, bottom line is,

10:05.368 --> 10:07.300
these guys want a
partnership with Reeves.

10:07.301 --> 10:08.800
They're practically throwing cash at us.

10:08.801 --> 10:11.067
And with your balance sheet
looking the way it does,

10:11.068 --> 10:13.326
you better dance like a
stripper for that cash.

10:19.075 --> 10:19.534
What are Ada

10:19.535 --> 10:20.800
- and Murphy doing here?
- There he is.

10:20.801 --> 10:22.567
No, Gideon, not today.

10:22.568 --> 10:24.634
I'm sorry. You guys can't be here.

10:24.635 --> 10:26.867
We've got Reeves Industries'
business to take care of.

10:26.868 --> 10:28.701
Yeah, so do we. There's been a murder.

10:28.702 --> 10:30.800
We're in Chicago. Of
course there was a murder.

10:30.801 --> 10:32.601
Who the hell is she?

10:32.602 --> 10:33.967
Murphy, Lauren. Lauren, Murphy.

10:33.968 --> 10:35.467
Gideon's busy.

10:35.468 --> 10:36.800
You're gonna have to
solve your own problems.

10:36.801 --> 10:38.812
We need to talk to Gideon
now. It's important.

10:38.815 --> 10:39.800
What's important

10:39.801 --> 10:41.967
is your boss' undivided
attention right here.

10:41.968 --> 10:43.967
Do you see my badge? I'm not asking.

10:43.968 --> 10:46.967
The company paid for that badge,
and the company's on the line.

10:46.968 --> 10:48.134
Lauren, you have to stop talking

10:48.135 --> 10:50.412
about profit margins for,
like, one second, okay?

10:50.415 --> 10:52.967
The killer stole a
wristband for this event.

10:52.968 --> 10:55.467
And to make matters worse,
I tracked his IP address.

10:55.470 --> 10:57.134
It took me to this hate forum.

10:57.135 --> 10:58.304
Read the last comment.

11:02.155 --> 11:04.221
"I'm gonna kill Gideon Reeves"?

11:07.901 --> 11:11.400
My day was going so well.

11:11.401 --> 11:16.530

-- <font co

11:19.499 --> 11:22.965
I think we're all taking
this a little too seriously.

11:22.966 --> 11:25.498
I mean, you're not really a celebrity

11:25.499 --> 11:27.165
till someone threatens to kill you.

11:27.166 --> 11:28.498
That's not funny.

11:28.499 --> 11:30.772
This wasn't just the one threat.

11:30.775 --> 11:32.898
Whoever this guy is, he's obsessed.

11:32.899 --> 11:35.065
And he's smart enough to
hide his IP address from me.

11:35.066 --> 11:37.299
- You couldn't track him at all?
- Nope.

11:37.300 --> 11:39.860
Best I could do was bring in the
administrator of the hate board.

11:40.660 --> 11:41.992
Murphy and...

11:41.995 --> 11:43.663
Ada are gonna interrogate him now.

11:43.666 --> 11:46.065
What? I don't know how to do that.

11:46.066 --> 11:47.783
You're just gonna translate. Come on.

11:49.899 --> 11:52.565
Hey. How long is this gonna take?

11:52.566 --> 11:54.065
It's a murder investigation.

11:54.066 --> 11:55.398
These things take a while.

11:55.399 --> 11:57.898
Yeah, but we don't have a while.

11:57.899 --> 11:59.398
Also, I've been looking around.

11:59.399 --> 12:01.898
There's about $10 million
in Reeves tech installed,

12:01.899 --> 12:04.065
which I never received
property requests for.

12:04.066 --> 12:06.398
It's an investment.

12:06.399 --> 12:08.632
It's a bottomless pit.

12:10.294 --> 12:11.999
Can I get you a donut?

12:14.298 --> 12:16.030
Okay,

12:16.031 --> 12:18.264
so you're an online ticket broker?

12:18.265 --> 12:20.464
Of sorts.

12:20.465 --> 12:22.697
So do you know ReevesReaper26?

12:22.698 --> 12:24.464
Maybe.

12:24.465 --> 12:27.097
Sure looks like you know him.

12:27.098 --> 12:29.930
Well, the traffic on your forum shows

12:29.931 --> 12:33.264
that you facilitated a sale
of a Windy City Tech Summit

12:33.265 --> 12:34.697
all-access wristband

12:34.698 --> 12:36.393
from a JoshMan5 to...

12:36.396 --> 12:38.697
a ReevesReaper26.

12:38.698 --> 12:40.164
- And?
- And we think

12:40.165 --> 12:42.597
ReevesReaper26 killed
JoshMan5 this morning.

12:42.598 --> 12:45.030
So AngryCop1 wants to know

12:45.031 --> 12:46.964
how your little chat
room set up a murder.

12:46.965 --> 12:48.497
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.

12:48.498 --> 12:51.164
I thought we were here
about some online harassment.

12:51.165 --> 12:52.998
You heard me.

12:55.019 --> 12:56.384
Murder.

12:56.387 --> 12:58.530
So you have a simple choice
to make: you either get charged

12:58.531 --> 12:59.630
with conspiracy or you give us something

12:59.631 --> 13:00.964
that we can actually use.

13:00.965 --> 13:03.697
Like what? I don't even
know who ReevesReaper is.

13:03.698 --> 13:05.964
You don't track your users,
tag 'em with an Evercookie?

13:05.965 --> 13:07.716
No. It's a troll site.

13:07.719 --> 13:09.794
Okay? People just blowing off steam.

13:09.797 --> 13:11.697
Trust me, I got no desire
to meet 'em in person.

13:11.698 --> 13:13.197
Especially not that guy.

13:13.198 --> 13:14.797
Why? What's his deal?

13:14.798 --> 13:16.697
All I know is his posts, okay?

13:16.698 --> 13:18.597
But dude's got some serious demons.

13:18.598 --> 13:19.797
Like psych ward-level stuff.

13:19.798 --> 13:21.630
Talking about Gideon stealing

13:21.631 --> 13:23.120
ideas straight from his brain.

13:23.123 --> 13:24.864
That's all I got, okay?

13:24.865 --> 13:26.864
It's not good enough. Keep thinking.

13:26.865 --> 13:29.164
Wait. Just wait.

13:30.698 --> 13:32.997
The wristband the guy was selling,

13:32.998 --> 13:35.130
he posted a picture
to prove it was real.

13:35.131 --> 13:36.895
I could download it for you.

13:36.898 --> 13:37.831
Might have the code.

13:38.865 --> 13:41.462
That's worth something, right?

13:41.465 --> 13:43.031
Yeah.

13:44.678 --> 13:46.864
Looks like you just found your
"get out of jail free" card

13:46.865 --> 13:48.031
there, Carter.

13:49.165 --> 13:51.964
Sir, we need to know where your son is.

13:51.965 --> 13:52.964
Hell if I know.

13:52.965 --> 13:54.630
But this is exactly the kind

13:54.631 --> 13:57.097
of thing His Majesty the
drama queen would pull.

13:57.098 --> 13:58.930
Yeah, well, the hotline
counselor he spoke with

13:58.931 --> 14:00.264
said it sounded serious.

14:00.265 --> 14:02.030
I'm sure it did. Just
like the time before

14:02.031 --> 14:03.252
and the two times before that.

14:03.255 --> 14:04.854
Kid just wants attention.

14:04.857 --> 14:06.658
When was the last time you saw Evan?

14:09.510 --> 14:11.676
Last night. He left here
screaming and crying.

14:11.679 --> 14:13.465
You mind telling us what happened?

14:13.468 --> 14:14.364
I do mind.

14:14.365 --> 14:15.876
This is family business.

14:15.879 --> 14:17.146
This is your son.

14:18.031 --> 14:19.697
And you can't tell us anything about...

14:19.698 --> 14:20.797
No, and I don't have to.

14:20.798 --> 14:23.030
- I know my rights.
- Jackson Barrett.

14:23.031 --> 14:24.763
- Damn it, Maura.
- Excuse me?

14:24.764 --> 14:27.930
Jackson Barrett. He's
Evan's friend at school.

14:27.931 --> 14:30.364
He might know where to find him.

14:30.365 --> 14:33.031
Thank you, ma'am.

14:36.271 --> 14:38.246
Please, just tell us he's safe.

14:41.531 --> 14:44.130
Geez, I thought you were
gonna clock that guy.

14:44.131 --> 14:45.597
Probably 'cause I was.

14:45.598 --> 14:47.597
We need to go back to that school.

14:47.598 --> 14:50.130
Hey, you heard 'em. The
kid's done this before.

14:50.131 --> 14:52.264
We've coded three calls
since we've been on this.

14:52.265 --> 14:53.431
We need to get back on the street.

14:53.432 --> 14:55.197
No, we need to find this kid.

14:55.198 --> 14:57.427
One of those calls was an armed robbery.

14:57.430 --> 14:59.329
You telling me that
chasing this around is

14:59.330 --> 15:00.548
- more important than that?
- You telling

15:00.550 --> 15:02.302
me there were fatalities
in that robbery?

15:02.305 --> 15:03.160
No.

15:03.163 --> 15:05.429
Then the possibility of
this kid killing himself

15:05.430 --> 15:07.330
is a hell of a lot more important.

15:11.572 --> 15:12.541
Okay,

15:12.544 --> 15:14.129
so here's what we got.

15:14.130 --> 15:16.329
According to the convention's QR log,

15:16.330 --> 15:19.662
this particular wristband
was scanned in at 12:22 p.m.

15:19.663 --> 15:21.662
All right. That's good, right?

15:21.663 --> 15:23.729
So he'll be on the security
footage. We got him.

15:23.730 --> 15:26.397
No, we don't got him. Look.

15:28.983 --> 15:30.874
- What's up with the camera?
- What is up is

15:30.877 --> 15:33.662
our killer knows his stuff.

15:33.663 --> 15:35.729
That's called an I.R. mask.

15:35.730 --> 15:38.563
Surveillance cameras
don't like LED lights.

15:38.564 --> 15:41.662
You wear enough of them, then
you turn into Casper there.

15:41.663 --> 15:43.496
Then you ditch the whole
thing when you get inside

15:43.497 --> 15:45.062
and you're untraceable.

15:45.063 --> 15:47.162
Not bad.

15:47.163 --> 15:48.396
I just mean the tech.

15:48.397 --> 15:50.829
The killer psychopath
part is-is totally uncool.

15:50.830 --> 15:52.496
Can't you track his wristband?

15:52.497 --> 15:53.829
No. Not once he's inside.

15:53.830 --> 15:55.429
Not unless he scans it again.

15:55.430 --> 15:58.329
Gideon, there's a man
inside that wants you dead.

15:58.330 --> 15:59.929
I think it's time

15:59.930 --> 16:01.162
- to shut the show down.
- Whoa, whoa.

16:01.163 --> 16:03.628
Slow down, Officer.
That is not an option.

16:03.631 --> 16:04.929
Detective.

16:04.930 --> 16:07.396
And I can do whatever I need
to in the name of public safety.

16:07.397 --> 16:09.230
Why don't you just find the
guy? Isn't that your job?

16:09.232 --> 16:10.849
There's almost
3,000 people in there.

16:10.850 --> 16:13.329
I don't have enough manpower
to scan every single wristband

16:13.330 --> 16:15.096
- one at a time...
- Wait. Just...

16:15.097 --> 16:16.762
don't kill each other, please.

16:16.763 --> 16:19.329
Everybody just dial it down.

16:19.330 --> 16:21.012
Pretty sure I can solve this.

16:24.663 --> 16:26.062
Can I borrow you

16:26.063 --> 16:27.729
for a second?

16:27.730 --> 16:29.262
Um, have a seat right there, please.

16:29.263 --> 16:30.396
What are you doing?

16:30.397 --> 16:32.795
So, to read a QR code,

16:32.796 --> 16:34.596
you need a light source,

16:34.597 --> 16:36.630
a computer...

16:37.830 --> 16:39.963
...and a camera.

16:42.330 --> 16:44.062
Just put your wrist right here.

16:44.063 --> 16:45.062
Ow.

16:45.063 --> 16:47.163
And that goes...

16:49.063 --> 16:51.496
You could be nicer to Murphy.

16:51.497 --> 16:54.396
Well, you know I've always had
a problem with authority figures.

16:54.397 --> 16:57.596
Right. Except for the
ones you sleep with.

16:57.597 --> 17:00.630
You sure you want to
lose that privilege?

17:04.497 --> 17:06.996
Look, Murphy can help us.

17:06.997 --> 17:08.662
So just lay off her, okay?

17:08.663 --> 17:10.061
Come on.

17:10.063 --> 17:11.896
There. There! Got it!

17:13.230 --> 17:15.162
Unbelievable.

17:15.163 --> 17:16.163
Okay!

17:17.327 --> 17:19.096
Okay. Okay.

17:19.097 --> 17:22.662
What if I told you we
could scan the entire crowd?

17:22.663 --> 17:24.496
- What?
- No way. That's too dangerous.

17:24.497 --> 17:25.996
You have a killer that's running around.

17:25.997 --> 17:27.329
Uh-huh. And what do
you think he's gonna do

17:27.329 --> 17:29.229
if we shut it down? Or
start searching people

17:29.230 --> 17:30.496
one by one? Best case,

17:30.497 --> 17:31.496
we lose him.

17:31.497 --> 17:33.229
Worst case, he goes nuts.

17:33.230 --> 17:34.996
He's got a good point.

17:34.997 --> 17:36.730
Your call, Murphy.

17:40.632 --> 17:42.064
What's your plan?

17:42.067 --> 17:45.329
We're gonna use me to find this guy.

17:45.330 --> 17:47.496
The hologram me.

17:47.497 --> 17:49.662
Look, the venue has
security cameras, right?

17:49.663 --> 17:53.288
So all we have to do is turn
the hologram lasers around

17:53.291 --> 17:54.491
to scan the crowd.

17:54.494 --> 17:57.162
Then we combine the two with
some QR-reading software.

17:57.163 --> 18:01.046
Bam. We mass-scan every
wristband in the place.

18:01.049 --> 18:02.996
Okay, but that's never been done before.

18:02.997 --> 18:04.563
Oh, well, if you're
trying to stroke my ego,

18:04.564 --> 18:05.662
then it's working.

18:05.663 --> 18:07.429
Aren't people gonna notice

18:07.430 --> 18:09.429
they're being zapped by a giant laser?

18:09.430 --> 18:11.096
Well, that's the best part...

18:11.097 --> 18:12.929
Once I change the light wavelength,

18:12.930 --> 18:15.353
they're not even gonna
be able to see the lasers.

18:15.356 --> 18:16.846
Murphy, please.

18:16.849 --> 18:19.582
Just give me a chance. I can do this.

18:23.995 --> 18:25.561
I'll give you half an hour.

18:26.642 --> 18:28.809
That seems reasonable.

18:33.975 --> 18:36.574
Oliver, buddy, how long
you been working for me?

18:36.575 --> 18:38.508
Uh, three years and
seven months, ever since

18:38.509 --> 18:39.797
I read your autobiography and

18:39.800 --> 18:41.174
- interviewed six times...
- Yes.

18:41.175 --> 18:43.174
Right. So you ought to know that
I know what I'm talking about.

18:43.175 --> 18:45.341
All I need is to reroute
the surveillance footage

18:45.342 --> 18:46.341
into my laptop

18:46.342 --> 18:48.041
so the QR reader can analyze it.

18:48.042 --> 18:49.074
But, sir,

18:49.075 --> 18:50.874
with all due respect, I just don't see

18:50.875 --> 18:52.174
how you're going to repurpose

18:52.175 --> 18:54.174
- the hologram to...
- Mm-hmm. So, new plan.

18:54.175 --> 18:56.674
You get out of my way,
reread that chapter in my book

18:56.675 --> 18:58.908
about how impatient I am, and
then I'm gonna do this myself.

18:58.909 --> 19:00.174
All right.

19:00.175 --> 19:01.574
Okay.

19:03.575 --> 19:06.908
Uh, look, um, I think we
got off on the wrong foot.

19:06.909 --> 19:08.741
I just want you to know
that it's nothing personal.

19:08.742 --> 19:10.908
Yeah? So then what is it?

19:10.909 --> 19:13.741
Well, it's just I've been
protecting Gideon for years.

19:13.744 --> 19:15.544
I mean, mostly from himself.

19:16.975 --> 19:19.841
The biggest outside threat has
been patent attorneys and...

19:19.842 --> 19:21.974
doctors' warnings about
his caffeine intake.

19:21.975 --> 19:23.641
And now he has a killer after him.

19:23.642 --> 19:25.408
I really don't see how that's my fault.

19:25.409 --> 19:26.874
But I'm not pointing the finger at you.

19:26.875 --> 19:29.208
It's just this kind
of thing never happened

19:29.209 --> 19:31.508
before Gideon took on this new hobby.

19:31.509 --> 19:34.508
This has nothing to do
with him working with us.

19:34.509 --> 19:36.508
And policing is not a hobby.

19:36.509 --> 19:38.641
Trust me,

19:38.642 --> 19:40.475
the law enforcement division

19:40.476 --> 19:42.807
will end up on the Reeves Industry

19:42.808 --> 19:45.008
Island of Misfit Toys,
along with geoscience

19:45.009 --> 19:46.674
and biophysical chemistry and...

19:46.675 --> 19:48.575
And you'll still be around?

19:50.142 --> 19:51.508
I'm the money.

19:51.509 --> 19:53.041
He may be a billionaire,

19:53.042 --> 19:56.308
but it takes billions
more to build his empire.

19:56.309 --> 19:57.974
Gideon's interests will come and go,

19:57.975 --> 20:00.476
but he needs me to pay for his dreams.

20:02.742 --> 20:04.741
We done yet?

20:04.742 --> 20:06.741
Almost.

20:06.742 --> 20:08.408
Gideon, the clock is ticking,

20:08.409 --> 20:09.800
and this looks really complicated.

20:09.803 --> 20:11.008
Trust me, it's gonna work.

20:11.009 --> 20:13.342
It'd better. 'Cause I'm
about to pull the plug.

20:18.808 --> 20:20.641
Don't look at me.

20:20.642 --> 20:23.042
I'm just the genius.

20:31.354 --> 20:32.853
Jackson Barrett?

20:32.856 --> 20:34.807
Yeah. What's going on?

20:34.808 --> 20:35.807
We're looking for Evan Finley.

20:35.808 --> 20:37.008
You know where he is?

20:37.009 --> 20:38.475
Uh...

20:38.476 --> 20:40.641
uh, not really. I don't...

20:40.642 --> 20:43.476
Mind if we talk outside?

20:46.024 --> 20:47.712
I told you,

20:47.715 --> 20:49.241
I don't know where Evan is.

20:49.242 --> 20:51.674
His parents seem to think you
might know how to find him.

20:51.675 --> 20:52.912
Why's that?

20:52.915 --> 20:54.008
I don't know.

20:54.009 --> 20:55.475
His parents gave you my name?

20:55.476 --> 20:58.208
Look, bro, your buddy
Evan, he may be in trouble.

20:58.209 --> 21:00.242
He called a suicide hotline.

21:03.448 --> 21:05.396
So if there's anything
you need to tell us...

21:07.242 --> 21:09.241
No?

21:09.242 --> 21:10.908
All right.

21:10.909 --> 21:12.241
Let's go.

21:12.242 --> 21:13.642
Jackson.

21:14.975 --> 21:17.774
We're not gonna talk to your parents.

21:17.775 --> 21:20.141
We'll keep your name out of our report.

21:20.142 --> 21:21.975
Just help us find Evan.

21:26.575 --> 21:28.408
I didn't want my parents to know

21:28.409 --> 21:29.742
about my first girlfriend either.

21:32.342 --> 21:33.674
I'm sorry.

21:33.675 --> 21:34.807
It's just

21:34.808 --> 21:36.241
I'm not...

21:36.242 --> 21:38.807
you know...

21:38.808 --> 21:40.807
out.

21:40.808 --> 21:43.174
Hey, that's nobody's business but yours.

21:43.175 --> 21:46.875
We're only concerned about Evan.

21:47.909 --> 21:49.707
I...

21:49.708 --> 21:52.308
I haven't seen him since yesterday.

21:52.309 --> 21:54.241
I tried calling.

21:54.242 --> 21:56.241
I got his voice mail.
Do you think he's...

21:56.242 --> 21:58.002
Yeah, that's what we're
trying to figure out.

22:00.313 --> 22:02.145
We have a secret Uber account.

22:02.148 --> 22:03.841
For when we go out.

22:03.842 --> 22:04.841
Maybe he used it?

22:04.842 --> 22:06.074
Yeah, yeah, that's great.

22:06.075 --> 22:07.541
That's really great. Can we see it?

22:07.542 --> 22:08.909
Yeah.

22:11.784 --> 22:13.574
Thank you.

22:13.575 --> 22:16.308
Thank you so much.

22:16.309 --> 22:18.408
Let's go.

22:24.009 --> 22:25.641
Okay, once we get eyes on this guy,

22:25.642 --> 22:28.174
- we take him down nice and easy.
- Shouldn't we have more backup?

22:28.175 --> 22:30.008
- It's hard to catch him in this crowd.
- I don't want to spook him

22:30.009 --> 22:31.641
with a lot of uniforms.
They're gonna cause a panic.

22:31.642 --> 22:34.674
So how is our brainiac boss
gonna find one wristband

22:34.675 --> 22:36.008
out of a room full of wristbands?

22:36.009 --> 22:37.008
If he says he can do it,

22:37.009 --> 22:38.074
that's good enough for me.

22:38.075 --> 22:39.408
Now let's spread out and be ready.

22:39.409 --> 22:41.241
All right, Gideon,

22:41.242 --> 22:42.974
it's now or never. All right, then.

22:42.975 --> 22:44.708
Just have to change the wavelength.

22:56.267 --> 22:57.506
Where we at, Gideon?

22:57.509 --> 22:58.741
There.

22:58.744 --> 23:00.877
Yes. It's showtime.

23:06.642 --> 23:08.241
Gideon, what's going on up there?

23:08.242 --> 23:09.874
A technological miracle.

23:09.875 --> 23:12.908
I'm scanning, like, a thousand
wristbands with lasers.

23:12.909 --> 23:14.742
So cut me some slack.

23:17.775 --> 23:21.409
Come on, come on. Where are you?

23:26.384 --> 23:29.115
Yes. Okay, okay, all right.

23:29.118 --> 23:30.241
Tracking him now, Murphy.

23:30.242 --> 23:32.213
Uh, he is in the southwest hall.

23:32.216 --> 23:33.382
Cobb, Reyes.

23:33.385 --> 23:34.618
We're on our way.

23:37.975 --> 23:39.045
Where is he?

23:39.048 --> 23:40.908
Hang on, let
me get my bearings here.

23:40.909 --> 23:42.308
Uh, southwest hall.

23:42.309 --> 23:44.741
Just past the drone
booth. Orange hoodie.

23:44.742 --> 23:47.096
I can't see what
you're seeing, Gideon.

23:47.099 --> 23:48.266
You're gonna have to help me out.

23:48.268 --> 23:49.810
Hang on one sec.

23:51.075 --> 23:53.075
Check your phone.

23:55.742 --> 23:57.542
Your six o'clock.

24:00.842 --> 24:02.807
Got it. Cobb,

24:02.808 --> 24:04.289
Reyes, orange hoodie.

24:09.909 --> 24:11.309
Chicago Police!

24:13.171 --> 24:14.671
He's going for the stairs.

24:25.607 --> 24:26.840
Hands up in the air.

24:29.490 --> 24:30.762
Turn around slowly.

24:32.642 --> 24:34.574
Please don't hurt me.

24:34.575 --> 24:36.075
I'm sorry.

24:41.786 --> 24:44.088
What can I tell
you? We got the wrong person.

24:44.143 --> 24:45.440
You're sure she didn't do it?

24:45.613 --> 24:46.754
I thought the whole point of this thing

24:46.800 --> 24:48.495
was we find the wristband,
we find the killer.

24:48.801 --> 24:50.209
She's a 16-year-old girl, Cobb.

24:50.526 --> 24:52.350
So what? I dated all kind
of chicks in high school

24:52.529 --> 24:53.598
who would've happily slit my throat.

24:53.936 --> 24:56.701
Okay. Well, we have her
coming through surveillance

24:56.702 --> 24:58.134
with a different wristband.

24:58.135 --> 25:00.267
The all-access wristband
we're tracking...

25:00.268 --> 25:01.801
She said she found from
across the bathrooms.

25:01.802 --> 25:03.434
If she didn't do it, why'd she run?

25:03.435 --> 25:05.935
Because she has a stolen
wristband, Sherlock.

25:05.936 --> 25:07.101
She thought that we were busting her

25:07.102 --> 25:08.301
for trying to score some swag

25:08.302 --> 25:09.301
with upgraded access.

25:09.302 --> 25:10.534
Okay, then why'd the bad guy

25:10.535 --> 25:12.602
ditch it here?

25:16.535 --> 25:19.002
Maybe because he was in there.

25:22.871 --> 25:24.538
What the hell did he want back here?

25:26.435 --> 25:30.032
Okay, look, the me that
cares about you really hopes

25:30.035 --> 25:31.534
they catch this guy. But the me

25:31.535 --> 25:32.701
that cares about Reeves Industries

25:32.702 --> 25:34.368
really needs you to
sign off on a few deals.

25:34.369 --> 25:35.434
Whatever.

25:35.435 --> 25:37.134
- Just buy them all.
- We can't.

25:37.135 --> 25:38.301
All right. Sell them all.

25:38.302 --> 25:40.034
Hey, are there security cams?

25:40.035 --> 25:41.034
No.

25:41.035 --> 25:42.334
Not in that area.

25:42.335 --> 25:43.634
It's a privacy thing.

25:43.635 --> 25:45.134
It's a bunch of
exhibitors with equipment

25:45.135 --> 25:46.335
they don't want photographed.

25:51.268 --> 25:53.201
Seriously, Gideon, I need
you to take a look at these...

25:53.202 --> 25:55.368
Lauren, we're hunting
a killer right now!

25:55.369 --> 25:56.601
Priorities.

25:56.602 --> 25:58.167
No, the police are hunting a killer.

25:58.168 --> 25:59.434
You are watching a screen.

25:59.435 --> 26:01.602
Okay, you've never watched Bones?

26:04.350 --> 26:07.015
Guys, there should be
a security guard there.

26:07.018 --> 26:08.562
Hey, over here.

26:13.869 --> 26:15.669
There's the guard. He's down.

26:18.189 --> 26:19.868
He's got a pulse.

26:19.869 --> 26:21.798
Squad, we need an ambulance.

26:21.801 --> 26:22.800
Copy that.

26:22.803 --> 26:24.803
Maybe the killer
needed backstage access.

26:25.869 --> 26:27.801
Or firepower.

26:27.802 --> 26:29.535
His gun's missing.

26:43.268 --> 26:45.501
You sure this is the place?

26:45.502 --> 26:47.502
I don't see anything.

26:48.635 --> 26:50.368
The Uber driver dropped him off here.

26:50.369 --> 26:51.836
Yeah, so where the hell is he?

26:56.702 --> 26:58.101
Think I found him.

26:58.102 --> 26:59.936
Oh, man.

27:03.769 --> 27:05.434
Evan?

27:05.435 --> 27:07.267
Get away from me!

27:07.268 --> 27:09.201
Hey, easy, buddy.

27:09.202 --> 27:11.669
- You don't want to do that.
- I said get back.

27:12.535 --> 27:15.167
Look, you don't know me.

27:15.168 --> 27:17.869
But I've spent the whole
day getting to know you.

27:19.969 --> 27:21.201
Met your mom.

27:21.202 --> 27:22.935
Your boyfriend Jackson.

27:22.936 --> 27:25.267
They both love you very much.

27:25.268 --> 27:26.768
You meet my dad, too?

27:26.769 --> 27:29.434
Yeah. We did.

27:29.435 --> 27:32.368
Well, send him a picture
when I jump, okay?

27:32.371 --> 27:34.965
He'll probably tell you it's
the only thing I ever did right.

27:34.966 --> 27:37.798
Call his dad. I'll keep him talking.

27:37.799 --> 27:39.865
Don't you think that's the
last person he wants to talk to?

27:39.866 --> 27:42.133
No, that's who he needs to talk to most.

27:43.233 --> 27:44.465
What am I supposed to say?

27:44.466 --> 27:46.132
Whatever it takes.

27:46.133 --> 27:47.465
Hey, Evan.

27:47.466 --> 27:50.798
Just calm down, okay? Talk to me.

27:50.799 --> 27:53.132
Mr. Finley, this is Officer
Brandt, Chicago Police.

27:53.133 --> 27:54.431
You don't want to do this.

27:54.432 --> 27:56.629
Just tell me what's
going through your mind.

27:56.632 --> 27:57.757
Let us help you.

27:57.760 --> 27:59.493
Let me help you.

27:59.496 --> 28:01.798
I've been in your position before.

28:01.799 --> 28:03.632
I am not going to argue with you, sir.

28:03.633 --> 28:06.565
Your son is one step away
from taking a swan dive.

28:06.566 --> 28:09.099
This is not a stunt. He means it.

28:09.100 --> 28:10.298
Come on, you don't really think

28:10.299 --> 28:11.398
there's any chance at all

28:11.399 --> 28:13.399
- that he's gonna...
- Listen to me.

28:14.799 --> 28:16.898
I served overseas.

28:16.899 --> 28:18.232
Four years.

28:18.233 --> 28:20.232
A lot of guys over there with me

28:20.233 --> 28:22.632
didn't do so well when they got back.

28:22.633 --> 28:24.865
I've lost many people to suicide.

28:24.866 --> 28:26.798
I know what it looks
like when they're serious.

28:26.799 --> 28:29.017
And your son is exactly that.

28:31.133 --> 28:33.132
You got a problem with who he loves,

28:33.133 --> 28:35.298
you man up and you deal with it.

28:35.299 --> 28:37.365
You hear what I'm saying to you?

28:37.366 --> 28:39.299
Right now we got to save his life.

28:41.299 --> 28:42.632
All right, I'll talk to him.

28:42.633 --> 28:44.798
Hey, Evan.

28:44.799 --> 28:46.765
I'm gonna bring you the phone now, okay?

28:46.766 --> 28:48.232
Your dad wants to talk to you.

28:48.233 --> 28:50.232
No, I'm done talking to him!

28:50.233 --> 28:52.298
- Okay.
- I said get back!

28:52.299 --> 28:56.232
Okay. Just take it easy.

28:56.233 --> 28:59.065
All right, Mr. Finley, the
phone call's not gonna work.

28:59.066 --> 29:01.032
New plan.

29:01.033 --> 29:02.898
You got a computer with a camera on it?

29:02.899 --> 29:04.632
Uh, yeah, I...

29:04.633 --> 29:06.133
Good, I'm gonna call you right back.

29:09.200 --> 29:10.865
Hey, Pete, it's Brandt. You copy?

29:10.866 --> 29:12.132
This is Pete. Go ahead.

29:12.133 --> 29:13.632
Need your help.

29:13.633 --> 29:15.431
You are totally overreacting.

29:15.432 --> 29:16.965
You can't keep me locked in here.

29:16.966 --> 29:19.132
You're staying here until
I shut this convention down.

29:19.133 --> 29:20.398
Oh, over my dead body.

29:20.399 --> 29:21.732
Don't tempt me.

29:21.733 --> 29:23.732
- Please...
- I'm sorry. This guy is dangerous.

29:23.733 --> 29:24.965
We have no idea what he's planning.

29:24.966 --> 29:26.798
He has a gun, for God's sakes.

29:26.799 --> 29:27.798
A gun.

29:27.799 --> 29:28.898
Yeah, it's a weapon.

29:28.899 --> 29:30.732
It's yea long and goes bang.

29:30.733 --> 29:32.398
- Murphy...
- Just listen.

29:32.399 --> 29:34.365
Remember the strategic
partnership with MilliScan?

29:34.366 --> 29:37.732
The boring gray boxes?
Yeah. I cannot believe

29:37.733 --> 29:39.902
- you want to talk business right now.
- This is the perfect time

29:39.904 --> 29:41.099
to talk business.

29:41.100 --> 29:43.699
Those boring gray boxes find guns.

29:46.966 --> 29:48.966
Wow, you're good.

29:54.554 --> 29:55.972
- It's pretty slick.
- Mm-hmm.

29:56.250 --> 29:59.516
Right? So we just need to
find a place to mount it

29:59.517 --> 30:02.216
and we can scan the crowd for weapons.

30:02.217 --> 30:04.082
Well, we're gonna
have to get it up high.

30:04.083 --> 30:05.549
Yeah.

30:05.550 --> 30:07.550
The rafters.

30:08.319 --> 30:09.916
He loves this part.

30:09.917 --> 30:11.249
Believe me, I know.

30:11.250 --> 30:12.916
So are you seriously telling me

30:12.917 --> 30:14.982
this can scan the whole crowd for a gun?

30:14.983 --> 30:16.414
Yeah, it's a portable version

30:16.416 --> 30:17.982
of the full body scanners at airports.

30:17.983 --> 30:19.849
So everyone is gonna jam in to here

30:19.850 --> 30:21.249
for my keynote speech.

30:21.250 --> 30:23.082
There's pretty much no
chance a guy obsessed with me

30:23.083 --> 30:26.149
is gonna miss that. And
that's when we get him.

30:26.150 --> 30:29.383
My gut feeling is that he
wants to take you down publicly.

30:29.384 --> 30:30.749
Probably during your speech.

30:30.750 --> 30:34.484
Do you really want to risk
your life for a few bucks?

30:39.153 --> 30:41.285
Not just money at stake, Murphy.

30:41.286 --> 30:43.418
It's my company. It's
everything I've built.

30:43.419 --> 30:45.254
It's the 13th district, too.

30:47.123 --> 30:49.290
I'm gonna wear a bulletproof vest.

30:50.719 --> 30:52.750
It's still a risk.

30:52.753 --> 30:54.585
Yeah.

30:54.586 --> 30:56.324
A risk that you take every day.

31:06.586 --> 31:09.485
Evan, I want you to
think about your future.

31:09.486 --> 31:12.318
For when you graduate from college

31:12.319 --> 31:14.105
and you-you're living your own life.

31:14.108 --> 31:15.985
No, it'll never be my own life.

31:15.986 --> 31:17.318
Never.

31:17.319 --> 31:19.885
It will, I promise you it will.

31:19.886 --> 31:21.551
You just got to stay strong, buddy.

31:21.552 --> 31:24.451
I can't anymore.

31:24.452 --> 31:26.219
I'm done talking.

31:26.220 --> 31:27.985
Hey, Pete,

31:27.986 --> 31:29.618
what's the ETA?

31:29.619 --> 31:31.252
It's getting desperate over here.

31:31.253 --> 31:32.551
I'm almost there.

31:32.552 --> 31:36.318
Just got to warn you,
this is not my finest work.

31:36.319 --> 31:37.986
It's a little duct tapey.

31:42.153 --> 31:44.085
What the...?

31:44.086 --> 31:45.653
What is that?

31:47.319 --> 31:49.053
Evan.

31:50.319 --> 31:51.818
What do you want?

31:51.819 --> 31:53.918
Please, God, let this work.

31:53.919 --> 31:57.551
Evan, I just want to
tell you I'm here, son.

31:57.552 --> 32:00.053
And I'm-I'm sorry.

32:01.486 --> 32:03.585
You said you wanted me gone.

32:03.586 --> 32:05.152
You said that...

32:05.153 --> 32:06.985
I said a lot of stupid things.

32:06.986 --> 32:09.318
I just... Look,

32:09.319 --> 32:12.752
why don't you just get down off there,

32:12.753 --> 32:14.551
and we'll... What he's trying to say

32:14.552 --> 32:16.819
is he loves you.

32:22.253 --> 32:24.152
Yes.

32:24.153 --> 32:26.719
I love you.

32:31.886 --> 32:33.818
We both do.

32:33.821 --> 32:35.691
That's it. Hold it steady, Pete.

32:35.694 --> 32:37.952
Uh...

32:37.953 --> 32:41.029
I'm trying. Just a
little emotional here.

32:44.819 --> 32:47.486
Please just come home.

32:53.124 --> 32:54.591
Come on, kid.

33:17.586 --> 33:18.975
Nice work.

33:22.317 --> 33:24.383
Okay, Cobb, you're
gonna take quadrant one.

33:24.384 --> 33:26.049
York, Wolfe, you're taking two.

33:26.050 --> 33:27.216
Reyes, Cotin, you're taking three.

33:27.217 --> 33:28.682
I'm gonna be in four.

33:28.683 --> 33:30.715
There's, like, a thousand people
in there, all staring at Gideon.

33:30.716 --> 33:31.916
How the hell are we supposed

33:31.917 --> 33:33.682
to find the one guy that wants him dead?

33:33.683 --> 33:35.416
You're just gonna
have to trust the tech.

33:35.417 --> 33:36.682
Where have we heard that before?

33:36.683 --> 33:38.416
This guy's not gonna
stay still for very long.

33:38.417 --> 33:41.384
The moment Ada spots
him, we take him down.

33:47.951 --> 33:49.717
Aah!

33:49.718 --> 33:51.303
Damn it.

33:52.513 --> 33:56.764
New invention idea: universal screws.

34:07.785 --> 34:10.117
Ah. Yes.

34:16.851 --> 34:19.717
Okay, and...

34:19.717 --> 34:21.918
Yeah.

34:24.551 --> 34:26.117
Hey, it's working.

34:26.118 --> 34:28.550
Well, we had to give up
12% ownership of MilliScan

34:28.551 --> 34:29.949
to get these so quickly.

34:29.951 --> 34:31.284
It damn well better work.

34:31.284 --> 34:32.449
What time do the doors open?

34:32.451 --> 34:35.516
Already did. It's do or die.

34:35.518 --> 34:37.184
Bad choice of words.

34:37.185 --> 34:38.384
Kinda.

34:38.385 --> 34:40.016
Oh, all right.

34:40.018 --> 34:41.284
A little bit tight.

34:41.284 --> 34:43.184
Right?

34:43.185 --> 34:44.384
Wait a second. Is this yours?

34:44.385 --> 34:46.117
We didn't have enough
time to get a new one.

34:46.118 --> 34:48.050
- I'm not taking your...
- Gideon,

34:48.051 --> 34:50.516
you're the one that's on
the business end of the gun.

34:50.518 --> 34:52.617
If you hear a shot, you drop, okay?

34:52.618 --> 34:54.217
Just stay low, protect your head,

34:54.217 --> 34:55.949
and try to get behind something.

34:55.951 --> 34:58.717
Try not to pee myself.

34:58.718 --> 35:01.417
I don't want you to do this.

35:01.418 --> 35:02.950
I know you don't.

35:02.951 --> 35:05.217
But I've been doing
the math on this, Murph.

35:05.218 --> 35:06.683
According to my calculations,

35:06.684 --> 35:09.617
there are three solid
arguments for why I should.

35:09.618 --> 35:12.284
One... Lauren is right.

35:12.285 --> 35:15.017
This convention is very
important to Reeves Industries.

35:15.018 --> 35:17.284
And now, for better or worse,

35:17.285 --> 35:21.284
what happens to Reeves
happens to the 13th district.

35:21.285 --> 35:24.683
Two... no matter how
crazy this killer might be,

35:24.684 --> 35:27.120
he's undeniably smart.

35:27.123 --> 35:29.519
We have to catch him before
he hurts other people.

35:29.522 --> 35:31.950
So, what, it takes a
genius to catch a genius?

35:31.951 --> 35:34.184
It takes a genius to know the only shot

35:34.185 --> 35:37.195
we have at catching this
lunatic involves the both of us,

35:37.198 --> 35:38.598
which brings me to my third argument...

35:38.600 --> 35:40.165
It's probably the most valid.

35:40.168 --> 35:43.349
I know I can go out there
'cause I have you to protect me.

35:43.352 --> 35:45.351
Of course I have your back.

35:45.352 --> 35:47.550
But what about that
billion-dollar brain of yours?

35:47.551 --> 35:49.550
This thing?

35:49.551 --> 35:51.551
That's hard as a rock.

35:53.618 --> 35:55.583
And
now, ladies and gentlemen,

35:55.584 --> 35:58.139
the moment you've all
been waiting for...

35:58.142 --> 36:01.017
The host of the Windy
City Tech Summit...

36:01.018 --> 36:03.950
Mr. Gideon Reeves!

36:11.923 --> 36:15.590
Yes! Ha-ha!

36:15.591 --> 36:17.956
Hello, Gideonites!

36:17.957 --> 36:20.689
Is that a thing? Can
we make that a thing?

36:20.690 --> 36:22.590
Welcome...

36:22.591 --> 36:24.189
Can't you get a-a
wider view of the crowd?

36:24.190 --> 36:26.789
No, it's a ten-by-ten range.
I had to do a grid search.

36:26.790 --> 36:29.789
I was going to give a speech about...

36:29.790 --> 36:33.123
how driverless cars will take
over the world, yada, yada.

36:33.124 --> 36:34.689
I think I'm gonna shake things up a bit.

36:34.690 --> 36:35.856
Is that okay with you guys?

36:35.857 --> 36:37.856
- Yeah!
- All right.

36:37.857 --> 36:39.856
- How we doing, Ada?
- I'm getting a lot of hits,

36:39.857 --> 36:41.189
but it's mostly just

36:41.190 --> 36:43.123
random metal stuff in people's pockets.

36:43.124 --> 36:44.856
Come on, Ada. You got to go faster.

36:44.857 --> 36:46.856
If we go any faster,
we might miss something.

36:46.857 --> 36:48.356
'Cause what I really want to talk

36:48.357 --> 36:50.922
about is risk.

36:50.923 --> 36:54.189
So when we first went
into space, was it awesome?

36:54.190 --> 36:57.423
Yes. Was it important
to science? Absolutely.

36:57.424 --> 36:59.356
But what was it above all?

36:59.357 --> 37:01.023
Incredibly dangerous.

37:01.024 --> 37:02.789
Check the northwest
corner closest to the exit.

37:02.790 --> 37:05.323
- She's right in the middle of...
- Just do it.

37:05.324 --> 37:06.922
It's the best place for the shooter.

37:06.923 --> 37:07.956
The best line of sight,

37:07.957 --> 37:09.789
and the best escape route.

37:09.790 --> 37:12.256
Okay. Does this woman have
any idea what she's doing?

37:12.257 --> 37:14.523
Actually, yeah, she really does.

37:14.524 --> 37:17.189
...pioneered the hot-air balloon.

37:17.190 --> 37:18.623
What a badass.

37:18.624 --> 37:22.089
He decides to cross the
English Channel by himself

37:22.090 --> 37:24.256
in a bag filled with air

37:24.257 --> 37:25.490
heated by an open fire.

37:25.491 --> 37:27.123
It's the first time
anyone had tried that.

37:27.124 --> 37:28.689
Damn it, where is he?!

37:28.690 --> 37:30.189
You know what happened?

37:30.190 --> 37:32.456
The balloon deflated mid-flight, and

37:32.457 --> 37:34.089
he fell to his death.

37:34.090 --> 37:38.089
Now, I don't tell you
that story to bum you out.

37:38.090 --> 37:40.123
That guy with his hand on his pocket.

37:40.124 --> 37:42.323
'Cause you know what? De
Rozier changed the world.

37:42.324 --> 37:43.523
- Gun! Gun!
- Murphy,

37:43.524 --> 37:45.956
you were right! Northwest
corner, blue sweater.

37:45.959 --> 37:47.291
He's moving towards the front!

37:47.294 --> 37:49.794
He took that risk for all
of us here in this room.

37:50.581 --> 37:51.956
'Cause without hot air balloons,

37:51.957 --> 37:53.689
you don't get rockets.

37:53.690 --> 37:56.689
You don't get self-driving cars.

37:56.690 --> 37:58.856
Any of it.

37:58.857 --> 38:00.856
Got him. Chicago Police!

38:00.857 --> 38:02.789
Drop the weapon!

38:06.690 --> 38:09.089
It's all right,
everyone. Calm down.

38:09.090 --> 38:11.470
Stay calm. The
situation's under control.

38:24.157 --> 38:25.789
It's okay.

38:25.790 --> 38:27.356
I'm fine.

38:28.690 --> 38:30.289
I'm fine.

38:30.290 --> 38:33.123
Oh.

38:33.124 --> 38:34.956
Doing all right?

38:34.957 --> 38:37.189
We good down there?

38:40.524 --> 38:43.739
Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it

38:43.742 --> 38:47.189
for the fine men and women
of Chicago's 13th district

38:47.190 --> 38:50.089
for saving my life!

39:07.305 --> 39:09.302
That was a good call today.

39:09.305 --> 39:11.063
Using the drone.

39:11.066 --> 39:14.623
Yeah, well, I guess it's got its uses.

39:14.624 --> 39:17.323
Until it becomes sentient
and tries to kill us.

39:19.357 --> 39:22.023
You want to talk about anything?

39:22.024 --> 39:23.856
No. You know me.

39:23.857 --> 39:26.356
I'm not really a big talker.

39:26.357 --> 39:28.689
But, um...

39:28.690 --> 39:32.190
you know, now that you mention it...

39:34.957 --> 39:38.090
I guess I never knew that you...

39:39.962 --> 39:42.794
...could go so damn long without eating.

39:42.797 --> 39:44.689
Can we please get some food?

39:44.690 --> 39:46.689
Yeah, man.

39:46.690 --> 39:48.690
Let's get some food.

39:51.190 --> 39:53.324
So, Morgan was a chick, then?

39:58.591 --> 40:00.123
Hey.

40:00.124 --> 40:01.856
How are your ribs?

40:01.857 --> 40:03.789
Oh, they're fine.

40:03.790 --> 40:05.922
I was looking for an excuse
to skip the gym, anyway.

40:05.923 --> 40:07.456
Well, that's the spirit.

40:07.457 --> 40:09.189
Oh, so I looked up the shooter.

40:09.190 --> 40:10.789
- Yeah?
- Ted Griffin.

40:10.790 --> 40:12.856
I never met him, but he actually worked

40:12.857 --> 40:14.689
at Reeves for a short time.

40:14.690 --> 40:16.656
Sounds like a smart guy,

40:16.657 --> 40:20.256
but HR had to let him go after
he failed a psych evaluation.

40:20.257 --> 40:21.656
Apparently, he had

40:21.657 --> 40:24.023
"obsessive thoughts and
delusions of grandeur

40:24.024 --> 40:25.423
in regard to Mr. Reeves."

40:25.424 --> 40:28.719
He swore he could hear
me whispering in his ear.

40:28.722 --> 40:29.888
Well, at least we know

40:29.891 --> 40:31.724
you're not the only
one obsessed with you.

40:32.923 --> 40:34.623
- You got lucky today.
- Mm.

40:34.624 --> 40:36.189
I mean, five inches north...

40:36.190 --> 40:39.123
Yeah, or 14 inches south, it
would have been a disaster.

40:39.124 --> 40:40.656
But it wasn't.

40:40.657 --> 40:43.690
And I have you to thank for that.

40:47.524 --> 40:48.990
I have a question.

40:51.190 --> 40:55.023
What happened to the
geoscience division at Reeves?

40:55.024 --> 40:56.356
Hmm?

40:56.357 --> 40:59.752
Lauren told me about it, and
a few other divisions, too.

40:59.755 --> 41:03.856
Said you started them, lost
interest and walked away.

41:04.495 --> 41:07.307
And you're worried that
I'm gonna do that here?

41:07.310 --> 41:09.523
It's crossed my mind.

41:09.524 --> 41:11.656
Right.

41:11.657 --> 41:14.327
Well, you know, all my life,

41:14.330 --> 41:17.423
I've, uh, chased the
most interesting problem,

41:17.424 --> 41:19.561
the hardest thing to solve,

41:19.564 --> 41:21.856
and some of 'em turn out to be too easy

41:21.857 --> 41:24.324
or not worth solving in the first place.

41:26.357 --> 41:30.089
But believe me, Murphy, this, uh...

41:30.090 --> 41:31.956
this is the hardest one ever.

41:31.957 --> 41:33.757
I'm not going anywhere.

41:36.524 --> 41:38.990
No matter what Lauren says.

41:40.024 --> 41:41.689
Who is she to you?

41:41.690 --> 41:43.689
We were classmates at MIT.

41:43.690 --> 41:46.213
I went into tech and she
went into tech finance.

41:46.216 --> 41:47.380
My first rocket... she...

41:47.383 --> 41:49.456
Gideon, who is she to you?

41:49.457 --> 41:52.055
Oh, that.

41:55.024 --> 41:56.689
That's complicated.

41:56.690 --> 41:58.989
♪ Caught up in my teeth... ♪

41:58.990 --> 42:00.856

42:05.424 --> 42:08.523

What has gotten into you?

42:10.591 --> 42:12.523
Ooh, is it 'cause I almost died?

42:12.524 --> 42:14.689
Mm, maybe a little.

42:14.690 --> 42:18.123
Did you see the press
on that conference?

42:19.790 --> 42:22.323
You know what? I've been
a little bit distracted.

42:22.324 --> 42:23.756
It was incredible.

42:23.757 --> 42:25.922
I mean, people finally saw
your technology in action.

42:25.923 --> 42:29.605
Oh, so, you've changed your
assessment of the 13th district?

42:29.608 --> 42:31.189
Yeah. Absolutely.

42:31.190 --> 42:33.956
If anything, I think
you're thinking too small.

42:33.957 --> 42:36.456
You, of all people, should
know better than that.

42:36.459 --> 42:38.087
I'm serious.

42:38.090 --> 42:40.856
I mean, people saw you get
shot in Reeves body armor

42:40.857 --> 42:43.756
and protected by Reeves police, and...

42:43.757 --> 42:46.523
Uh, technically, they're
not my police, but...

42:46.524 --> 42:51.518
My point is, it's something
that people will pay for.

42:54.790 --> 42:57.922

small Chicago experiment.

43:01.690 --> 43:03.089
I mean, this could go global.

43:03.090 --> 43:05.689
This could be a billion-dollar business.
